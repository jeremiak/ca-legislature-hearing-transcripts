CHAIR I JUST HAVE A REAL QUICK

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:10.043
QUESTION THE COPY I P. I GUESS

00:05:10.109 --> 00:05:11.344
I MISSED THAT ONE POINT FIVE

00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:12.478
MILLION DOLLARS THE INCREASE

00:05:12.545 --> 00:05:14.180
ONE OF THE ONE OF THE PIECES

00:05:14.247 --> 00:05:15.415
THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME

00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:17.483
IN THE CAL VIP PROGRAM IS THAT

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.185
BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT IT'S

00:05:19.252 --> 00:05:20.720
SET UP AND THIS IS REALLY TO

00:05:20.787 --> 00:05:22.689
REDUCE GANG VIOLENCE IN IN IN

00:05:22.755 --> 00:05:25.224
OUR COMMUNITIES MANY RURAL

00:05:25.291 --> 00:05:26.659
ISOLATED COMMUNITIES HAVE THE

00:05:26.726 --> 00:05:27.994
SAME GAME VIOLENCE ISSUE THAT

00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:29.962
THE BIG CITIES DO AND SO WE DID

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:31.464
A CARVE OUT FOR COMMUNITIES OF

00:05:31.531 --> 00:05:33.132
LESSEN FORD FORTY THOUSAND

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:34.200
DOLLARS FORTY THOUSAND

00:05:34.267 --> 00:05:35.935
INHABITANTS. IN AN EFFORT TO

00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:37.770
TRY TO GET RESOURCES INTO SOME

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:38.971
OF THOSE COMMUNITIES AND IF YOU

00:05:39.038 --> 00:05:40.973
MAKE THE GRANTS TO BIG THEN

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.008
THERE'S LESS MONEY TO GO AROUND

00:05:42.075 --> 00:05:43.710
AND MOST OF THESE COMMUNITIES

00:05:43.776 --> 00:05:45.178
DON'T REALLY NEED ONE POINT

00:05:45.244 --> 00:05:46.713
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN A GRANT

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:48.414
THEY JUST A HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:50.349
DOLLARS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:05:50.416 --> 00:05:51.150
DOLLARS MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE

00:05:51.217 --> 00:05:54.287
SO I I'M I'M WONDERING IF YOU

00:05:54.353 --> 00:05:56.489
COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT.

00:05:56.556 --> 00:05:57.890
THAT I MEAN A MY CONCERN IS IT

00:05:57.957 --> 00:05:59.158
GOES UP TO MOST OF THE BIG

00:05:59.225 --> 00:06:01.294
CITIES AND IN THE PAST THAT'S

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.428
BEEN FINE WITH ME BECAUSE

00:06:02.495 --> 00:06:03.730
SALINAS HAS BEEN CONSIDERED ONE

00:06:03.796 --> 00:06:04.764
OF THE BIG CITIES BUT I NOW

00:06:04.831 --> 00:06:06.632
HAVE TWENTY SEVEN CITIES THAT

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:09.535
ARE SMALLER THAN THAT AND SO IF

00:06:09.602 --> 00:06:11.971
YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT PLEASE

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:13.673
MAKE TWO QUICK POINTS AND ALSO

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:14.240
TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE

00:06:14.307 --> 00:06:15.241
HERE AND THE FIRST IS THAT I

00:06:15.308 --> 00:06:17.343
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:18.745
THAT WAS ONE REASON WHILE THE

00:06:18.811 --> 00:06:21.814
CAP IS INCREASED. WE DID NOT

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:22.315
SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO JUST

00:06:22.381 --> 00:06:23.449
REMOVING CAP ALTOGETHER AND FOR

00:06:23.516 --> 00:06:24.417
EXACT CONCERNS THAT YOU

00:06:24.484 --> 00:06:26.119
MENTIONED WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:06:26.185 --> 00:06:26.686
THAT THERE IS A CAP THAT IS

00:06:26.753 --> 00:06:29.055
MEANINGFUL THE SECOND POINT IS

00:06:29.122 --> 00:06:30.389
THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF A THREE

00:06:30.456 --> 00:06:32.759
MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAMS RATHER

00:06:32.825 --> 00:06:33.926
THAN A NINE MILLION DOLLAR

00:06:33.993 --> 00:06:35.795
PROGRAMS WE THOUGHT THAT IT

00:06:35.862 --> 00:06:36.429
PRISON THE CAP IS NOT GIVE SOME

00:06:36.496 --> 00:06:37.563
FLEXIBILITY TO THE BIG CITIES

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:38.164
WHILE ALSO MAINTAINING

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:40.266
RESOURCES FOR STATE FOR

00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:41.534
PROGRAMS IN ALL DIFFERENT AREAS

00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:42.802
OF THE STATE AND THEN THE THIRD

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:43.836
POINT I WOULD MENTION IS FOR

00:06:43.903 --> 00:06:45.738
SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS IT TAKES

00:06:45.805 --> 00:06:47.206
SEVERAL YEARS TO REALLY GAUGE

00:06:47.273 --> 00:06:48.841
THE- EFFECTIVENESS SO HAVING

00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:50.643
THIS LARGER AMOUNT BUT SPREAD

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:56.249
OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS. MIGHT

00:06:56.315 --> 00:06:56.883
ENABLE US TO DO THAT. I'LL TURN

00:06:56.949 --> 00:07:02.955
IT OVER TO MISTER EDWARDS. ERIN

00:07:03.022 --> 00:07:05.491
EDWARDS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

00:07:05.558 --> 00:07:06.793
SO JUST WHAT AT TWO OF MY

00:07:06.859 --> 00:07:08.995
COLLEAGUE SAID BY NOTING THAT.

00:07:09.061 --> 00:07:09.829
I THINK IN THE PAST THE BORDERS

00:07:09.896 --> 00:07:11.264
STAY IN COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:12.165
WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:13.432
ALLOCATING THESE GROUNDS. HAS

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:14.233
THEY'VE NOTED THAT THE THERE

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.003
HAVE BEEN A RELUCTANCE ON ON

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:18.337
THE PART OF SOME. WELL HOW IT

00:07:18.404 --> 00:07:19.939
IS TO APPLY FOR THE FOR THESE

00:07:20.006 --> 00:07:20.506
GRANTS BECAUSE OF THE FIVE

00:07:20.573 --> 00:07:21.641
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR CAP.

00:07:21.707 --> 00:07:22.074
GIVEN THE NUMBER OF

00:07:22.141 --> 00:07:23.442
ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS ON

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:24.744
REPORTING ON THESE GRANTS. I

00:07:24.811 --> 00:07:26.245
THINK IT HAS DISSUADED SOME

00:07:26.312 --> 00:07:27.146
SOME LOCALS FROM FROM APPLYING

00:07:27.213 --> 00:07:29.482
I THINK. THEIR ANTICIPATION IS

00:07:29.549 --> 00:07:31.083
THAT BY RAISING THAT CAP TO ONE

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:32.418
POINT FIVE MILLION IS GOING TO

00:07:32.485 --> 00:07:35.454
OPEN UP. APPLICATION STATE TO

00:07:35.521 --> 00:07:40.092
CUT. LOCALITIES THAT HAVE BEEN

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:45.198
RELUCTANT TO APPLY IN THE PAST.

00:07:45.264 --> 00:07:46.199
YEAH YES I GUESS I BACK I JUST

00:07:46.265 --> 00:07:47.133
WANT TO PUT IS A FOOTNOTE TO

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:47.633
THAT I APPRECIATE THAT

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.001
EXPLANATION THANK YOU. IS THAT

00:07:49.068 --> 00:07:49.969
IT'S NOT THE SMALLER

00:07:50.036 --> 00:07:51.003
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE RELUCTANT

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:51.571
TO APPLY IT IT'S A BIGGER

00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:53.639
CITIES WHO HAVE MORE RESOURCES

00:07:53.706 --> 00:07:54.273
AND THEY LOOK AT IT AND THEY

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.775
SAY WE GOT ENOUGH MONEY TO DEAL

00:07:55.842 --> 00:07:56.976
WITH THIS SO. WE'RE NOT GOING

00:07:57.043 --> 00:07:58.311
TO GO THROUGH THE STATE GRANT

00:07:58.377 --> 00:07:59.912
PROCESS SO I I'LL JUST LEAVE IT

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:01.380
AT THAT AND TELL YOU THAT THIS

00:08:01.447 --> 00:08:02.815
IS. I THINK A REAL IMPORTANT

00:08:02.882 --> 00:08:05.084
RESOURCE. THAT HAS BEEN

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:06.452
UNAVAILABLE TO SMALLER

00:08:06.519 --> 00:08:08.254
COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THEY JUST

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:09.255
DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:10.122
THE GRANT AND THEN TO FOLLOW

00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:12.658
THROUGH. AND THEY HAVEN'T BEEN

00:08:12.725 --> 00:08:14.827
ABLE TO COMPETE BASED ON THAT

00:08:14.894 --> 00:08:17.029
THAT ANALYSIS THAT YOU HAVE TO

00:08:17.096 --> 00:08:18.364
HAVE HI VIOLENCE IN YOUR

00:12:48.934 --> 00:12:49.401

00:15:35.901 --> 00:15:38.237
WHERE SUCH EVIDENCE IS RELEVANT

00:15:38.304 --> 00:15:43.509
IT ALSO CANNOT OF. PROCESS SEND

OF CUSTODY YES THANK YOU ARE

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:53.352
NOT BEING A LAWYER I DON'T KNOW

00:15:53.419 --> 00:15:55.321
ALL THE TERMS ANYWAY SO THAT'S

00:15:55.387 --> 00:15:57.890
REALLY WHAT FROM I THINK OUR

00:15:57.956 --> 00:15:59.291
BUDGET SUB COMMITTEES POINT OF

00:15:59.358 --> 00:16:00.793
VIEW WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO

00:16:00.859 --> 00:16:02.461
ACHIEVE AND I THINK WHAT

00:16:02.528 --> 00:16:04.596
HAPPENED IN OUR DISCUSSIONS IS

00:16:04.663 --> 00:16:07.132
THAT. WE AS A LEGISLATURE

00:16:07.199 --> 00:16:08.734
APPROVED A BUDGET THAT HAD

00:16:08.801 --> 00:16:10.035
THREE POINT FIVE MILLION FOR

00:16:10.102 --> 00:16:12.237
THE OFFICE WHICH IS GREAT AND

00:16:12.304 --> 00:16:14.206
IS REFLECTED HERE AND I THINK

00:16:14.273 --> 00:16:16.742
IN THE INTERIM DISCUSSIONS AS

00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:18.010
TO HOW THAT WOULD BE ALLOCATED

00:16:18.077 --> 00:16:20.279
IT WAS VIEWED THAT. THE

00:16:20.346 --> 00:16:21.313
ESTABLISHMENT OF A PEACE

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.782
OFFICER WOULD NEED ADDITIONAL

00:16:23.849 --> 00:16:25.351
FUNDS OVER AND ABOVE THREE

00:16:25.417 --> 00:16:26.952
POINT FIVE MILLION AND I THINK

00:16:27.019 --> 00:16:30.356
THAT WHAT WE DIDN'T REALLY

00:16:30.422 --> 00:16:32.091
FACTOR IS THE FACT THAT THERE

00:16:32.157 --> 00:16:34.159
ARE EXISTING STAFF WITH IN THAT

00:16:34.226 --> 00:16:36.328
UNIT WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN

00:16:36.395 --> 00:16:39.231
SWORN PEACE OFFICERS SO THAT WE

00:16:39.298 --> 00:16:41.700
MAY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

HAVING TO CREATE A NEW POSITION

00:16:47.573 --> 00:16:49.241
AND THAT'S CERTAINLY I THINK

00:16:49.308 --> 00:16:50.776
WHAT PART OF WHAT WE ARE

00:16:50.843 --> 00:16:55.948

00:21:01.226 --> 00:21:02.094
AVAILABLE THAT THE DEPARTMENT

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.795
OF FINANCE IS STUDYING THE

00:21:03.862 --> 00:21:06.365
GENERAL OUTLINE IS THAT THE

00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:07.799
REASON WOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO

00:21:07.866 --> 00:21:09.001
A NONPROFIT TRIES TO SAID THAT

00:21:09.067 --> 00:21:10.569
THAT TRUST CAN BURN A

00:21:10.636 --> 00:21:12.037
SUFFICIENT RATE OF RETURN ON

00:21:12.104 --> 00:21:13.605
THOSE INVESTMENTS TO MAKE SURE

THAT THE FUNDING CAN EXIST IN

00:21:14.573 --> 00:21:16.808
PERPETUITY AND A NONPROFIT CAN

00:21:16.875 --> 00:21:18.710
INVEST THOSE FUNDS IN A MATTER

00:21:18.777 --> 00:21:20.112
THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE

00:21:20.178 --> 00:21:21.747
STATE GOVERNMENT WHILE STILL

00:21:21.813 --> 00:21:22.781
ENSURING THAT ITS INVESTMENT

00:21:22.848 --> 00:21:24.249
MATTER THAT STATION PRUDENT BUT

00:21:24.316 --> 00:21:25.751
ALSO GAINS THAT RATE OF RETURN

00:21:25.817 --> 00:21:28.320
WHERE YOU CAN USE THE MONEY

00:21:28.387 --> 00:21:30.722
YEAR OVER YEAR IN A WAY THAT'S

00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:31.323
MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN IF THE

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:32.157
MONEY WERE KEPT WITHIN THE

00:21:32.224 --> 00:21:33.759
STATE. AT THE SAME TIME TO YOUR

00:21:33.825 --> 00:21:35.861
POINT THE ADMINISTRATION DOES

00:21:35.927 --> 00:21:37.329
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE

00:21:37.396 --> 00:21:38.397
SUFFICIENT OVERSIGHTS OF THE

00:21:38.463 --> 00:21:40.132
OVERSIGHT OF FINES BOTH IN

00:21:40.198 --> 00:21:41.566
TERMS OF ITS COMPLIANCE WITH

00:21:41.633 --> 00:21:42.367
THE NATIONAL MORTGAGE

00:21:42.434 --> 00:21:44.703
SETTLEMENT AND ALSO TO ENSURE

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:45.604
THAT USED EFFECTIVELY SO THE

00:21:45.671 --> 00:21:46.605
TWO MAJOR PURPOSES WE'VE

00:21:46.672 --> 00:21:48.306
IDENTIFIED THAT ARE CONSISTENT

00:21:48.373 --> 00:21:50.008
WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S

00:21:50.075 --> 00:21:51.009
INSTRUCTIONS AND NOT SETTLEMENT

00:21:51.076 --> 00:21:52.978
ARE NUMBER ONE HELPING PREVENT

00:21:53.045 --> 00:21:55.380
FORECLOSURES AND NUMBER TWO

00:21:55.447 --> 00:21:56.882
REALLY FOR RENTERS AND LEGAL

00:21:56.948 --> 00:21:58.250
AID FOR THEM AS THEY ARE GOING

00:21:58.316 --> 00:22:00.352
THROUGH THESE PROCEEDINGS BUT

00:22:00.419 --> 00:22:01.586
THAT IS AN ISSUE WHEN IT COMES

00:22:01.653 --> 00:22:03.321
TO THE DETAIL THAT THE

00:22:03.388 --> 00:22:04.556
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WANTS TO

00:22:04.623 --> 00:22:05.257
STUDY. AND WANTS TO BE INTO

00:22:05.323 --> 00:22:06.725
OPTIONS WILL OF COURSE REQUIRE

00:22:06.792 --> 00:22:08.126
FURTHER ACTION FROM THE

00:22:08.193 --> 00:22:09.728
LEGISLATURE BEFORE EVERYTHING

00:22:09.795 --> 00:22:12.497
IS CREATED AND GETS GOING HOW

00:22:12.564 --> 00:22:14.199
CLEAR IS THE LEGISLATIVE HOURS

00:22:14.266 --> 00:22:20.038
THE STORY HERE IT WOULD APPEAR.

00:22:20.105 --> 00:22:20.672
THE ADMINISTRATION CARRIES MOST

00:22:20.739 --> 00:22:24.676
OF THE AUTHORITY. IN OVERSEEING

00:22:24.743 --> 00:22:25.944
THIS TRUST. TO THE LEGISLATURE

00:22:26.011 --> 00:22:27.345
DOES HAVE TO APPROPRIATE THE

00:22:27.412 --> 00:22:28.647
MONEY. AND AS PART OF THAT THAT

00:22:28.714 --> 00:22:29.281
WOULD BE AN ONGOING DISCUSSION

00:22:29.347 --> 00:22:29.915
WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON HOW

00:22:29.981 --> 00:22:30.449
THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATED

00:22:30.515 --> 00:22:31.683
INCLUDING THE DESIGN OF ANY

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:32.651
OVERSIGHT MECHANISMS FOR THAT

00:22:32.718 --> 00:22:35.087
MONEY. BUT THE ADMINISTRATION

00:22:35.153 --> 00:22:37.689
COULD MAKE OBLIGATIONS. IT

00:22:37.756 --> 00:22:38.523
WOULD PUT PRESSURE ON THE

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:40.092
LEGISLATURE TO HAVE TO GO ALONG

00:22:40.158 --> 00:22:42.928
WITH THAT NOT BE THE CASE.

00:22:42.994 --> 00:22:44.563
ULTIMATELY THE FIGHT THE FINAL

00:22:44.629 --> 00:22:46.198
BILL GOVERNING HOW THIS MONEY

00:22:46.264 --> 00:22:48.967
IS USED WOULD HAVE TO BE PASSED

00:22:49.034 --> 00:22:51.903
BY THE LEGISLATURE. BUT IT DOES

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:55.307
GIVE FRONT END PRESSURE I THINK.

00:22:55.373 --> 00:22:56.942
CERTAINLY THE GOVERNOR AND THE

00:22:57.008 --> 00:22:58.677
ADMINISTRATION HAVE A VIEW ON

00:22:58.744 --> 00:23:00.011
HOW THE MONEY SHOULD BE SPENT

00:23:00.078 --> 00:23:01.580
IN THAT WAS THE GOVERNOR

00:23:01.646 --> 00:23:02.614
RELEASED PROPOSAL ALONG THESE

00:23:02.681 --> 00:23:05.217
LINES ABOUT A MONTH AGO. BUT IT

00:23:05.283 --> 00:23:07.152
WAS IN CONCERT WITH DISCUSSIONS

00:23:07.219 --> 00:23:08.987
WITH MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE

00:23:09.054 --> 00:23:10.122
AND THOSE DISCUSSIONS WILL BE

00:23:10.188 --> 00:23:11.757
ON GOING THIS PROCESS IS.

00:23:11.823 --> 00:23:14.259
DEFINITELY NOT COMPLETE BILL IS

00:23:14.326 --> 00:23:16.728
CHAPTER THEN WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.

00:23:16.795 --> 00:23:18.330
SO THIS BILL ESTABLISHES THE

00:23:18.396 --> 00:23:20.599
INTENT LANGUAGE THE MONEY IS

00:23:20.665 --> 00:23:22.734
TRANSFERRED INTO THIS ACCOUNT

00:23:22.801 --> 00:23:24.069
AND THEN IF THIS BILL IS PASSED

00:23:24.136 --> 00:23:25.237
THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE HAS IN

00:23:25.303 --> 00:23:27.205
PREPARATION TO STUDY FURTHER

00:23:27.272 --> 00:23:28.039
OPTIONS FOR EXACTLY WHAT THE

00:23:28.106 --> 00:23:29.908
OVERSIGHT MECHANISM IS AND HOW

00:23:29.975 --> 00:23:32.010
EXACTLY THE MONEY WILL BE USED.

00:23:32.077 --> 00:23:33.345
BUT IT WILL TAKE FURTHER

00:23:33.411 --> 00:23:35.781
LEGISLATIVE ACTION NEXT YEAR

00:23:35.847 --> 00:23:37.249
BEFORE ANY OF THESE FUNDS CAN

00:23:37.315 --> 00:23:39.651
BE TRANSFERRED TO A NON PROFIT

00:23:39.718 --> 00:23:41.086
OR BEFORE ANY BOARD IS

00:23:41.153 --> 00:23:42.788
ESTABLISHED WITH APPOINTMENTS

00:23:42.854 --> 00:23:44.322
OVERSEEING THE USE OF THOSE

00:23:44.389 --> 00:23:46.958
FUNDS IN THAT NONPROFIT OR WITH

00:23:47.025 --> 00:23:48.426
REGARD TO HOW THESE FUNDS ARE

00:23:48.493 --> 00:23:51.096
ACTUALLY DISPERSED ALL OF THAT

00:23:51.163 --> 00:23:54.533
WILL TAKE ADDITIONAL. ACTION.

00:23:54.599 --> 00:23:56.067
THAT WOULD BE BUDGET ACTION

00:23:56.134 --> 00:23:56.935
TRAILER BILL ACTION. BUT WHAT

00:23:57.002 --> 00:23:58.236
FORM YES IT WOULD BE WOULD BE

00:23:58.303 --> 00:23:59.104
CERTAINLY LEGISLATIVE ACTION IN

00:23:59.171 --> 00:23:59.771
SOME FORM WITH REGARD TO BE

00:23:59.838 --> 00:24:02.140
EXACT VEHICLE UP BEAT OUT BE

00:24:02.207 --> 00:24:02.774
DISCUSSIONS WITH MEMBERS OF THE

00:24:02.841 --> 00:24:06.011
LEGISLATURE. AND WHAT AGAIN IT

00:24:06.077 --> 00:24:08.713
WOULD BE THE- THE REASON FOR.

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:11.316
ESTABLISHING THE- SETTLEMENT

00:24:11.383 --> 00:24:13.351
TRUST. WHAT WHAT IS THE

00:24:13.418 --> 00:24:14.486
ADMINISTRATION TRYING TO

00:24:14.553 --> 00:24:17.255
ACCOMPLISH BY THIS METHOD. YES

00:24:17.322 --> 00:24:20.225
SO WHEN IT COMES TO THREE

00:24:20.292 --> 00:24:20.759
HUNDRED THIRTY ONE MILLION

00:24:20.826 --> 00:24:22.494
DOLLARS THE ADMINISTRATION AND

00:24:22.561 --> 00:24:22.994
THIS FOLLOWS ON WHAT THE

00:24:23.061 --> 00:24:24.129
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION ON HAD

00:24:24.196 --> 00:24:26.097
BEEN. PURSUING A COURT CASE

00:24:26.164 --> 00:24:27.165
WITH REGARD TO THE USE THAT

00:24:27.232 --> 00:24:28.800
MONEY BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE

00:24:28.867 --> 00:24:29.935
HAD PREVIOUSLY APPROPRIATED

00:24:30.001 --> 00:24:32.571
SEVERAL YEARS AGO. AND GOVERNOR

00:24:32.637 --> 00:24:33.839
BROWN HAD SIGNED DIFFERENT USE

00:24:33.905 --> 00:24:36.575
OF THAT MONEY FOR THOSE FINES.

00:24:36.641 --> 00:24:38.043
THAT WAS REJECTED BY THE COURT

00:24:38.109 --> 00:24:39.144
AND THE COURT SAID THE MONEY

00:24:39.211 --> 00:24:40.545
HAS TO BE RE PROCREATIVE IN

00:24:40.612 --> 00:24:41.580
LINE WITH THE SETTLEMENT

00:24:41.646 --> 00:24:43.448
INSTRUCTIONS. SO THERE ARE MANY

00:24:43.515 --> 00:24:44.883
WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN USE THAT

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:46.484
MONEY WITH REGARD TO THE

00:24:46.551 --> 00:24:47.385
SETTLEMENT INSTRUCTIONS

00:24:47.452 --> 00:24:48.954
ALTHOUGH IT IS STILL A-

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:49.354
RELATIVELY SERVICE

00:24:49.421 --> 00:24:52.123
CIRCUMSCRIBED UNIVERSE. AND

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:52.958
WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION

00:24:53.024 --> 00:24:54.926
BELIEVED IN WHAT WE HOPE D. F.

00:24:54.993 --> 00:24:56.094
FITS WITH WHAT LEGISLATIVE

00:24:56.161 --> 00:24:57.996
PRIORITIES ARE IS THAT RATHER

00:24:58.063 --> 00:24:59.764
THAN USING IT ON A ONE TIME

00:24:59.831 --> 00:25:01.700
BASIS AND SAYING THERE'S THREE

00:25:01.766 --> 00:25:02.234
HUNDRED THIRTY ONE MILLION

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.236
DOLLARS. WHAT SPEND IT ON A OR

00:25:04.302 --> 00:25:05.170
D. ON A ONE YEAR OR THREE YEAR

00:25:05.237 --> 00:25:06.905
BASIS AND IT'S TIME WHY DON'T

00:25:06.972 --> 00:25:09.107
WE CREATE AN ON GOING PERMANENT

00:25:09.174 --> 00:25:11.376
SOURCE OF FUNDING AND PART OF

00:25:11.443 --> 00:25:12.344
THAT WAS INSPIRED BY. WHAT

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:13.612
OCCURRED AND THE ENACTMENT OF

00:25:13.678 --> 00:25:14.813
THIS YEAR'S BUDGET WHERE THERE

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:15.814
WAS AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY

00:25:15.881 --> 00:25:17.916
MILLION DOLLARS ON A ONE TIME

00:25:17.983 --> 00:25:19.985
BASIS FOR A RENTER PROTECTIONS

00:25:20.051 --> 00:25:21.286
MONEY THAT FLOW THROUGH THE

00:25:21.353 --> 00:25:23.622
JUDICIAL COUNCIL. AND THE

00:25:23.688 --> 00:25:24.322
ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES THAT

00:25:24.389 --> 00:25:26.291
WITH APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT

00:25:26.358 --> 00:25:27.525
PROGRAMS LIKE THAT CAN BE VERY

00:25:27.592 --> 00:25:30.095
EFFECTIVE AND WE WOULD BE VERY

00:25:30.161 --> 00:25:31.263
USEFUL IF RATHER THAN THAT

00:25:31.329 --> 00:25:32.364
BEING SUBJECT TO THE VAGARIES

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:37.936
OF THE BUDGET PROCESS. THERE.

00:25:38.003 --> 00:25:38.470
WERE A PERMANENT SOURCE OF

00:25:38.536 --> 00:25:39.070
FUNDING THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE

00:25:39.137 --> 00:25:44.376
YEAR OVER YEAR. WITH THE

00:25:44.442 --> 00:25:46.311
ASSUMPTION HERE IS THAT THE-

00:25:46.378 --> 00:25:48.280
MONEY WILL BE MADE AND AS YOU

00:25:48.346 --> 00:25:49.748
INDICATED FOR THE WE DID A

00:25:49.814 --> 00:25:50.815
CRUCIAL MONEY AND WAS ABLE TO

00:25:50.882 --> 00:25:51.449
BE DIRECTED TOWARDS A- AND IDEA

00:25:51.516 --> 00:25:55.153
PROGRAM. WELL THE INVESTMENT

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:57.956
COULD GO BAD AS WELL WHAT

00:25:58.023 --> 00:25:59.925
HAPPENS IN THAT CASE CITIES ARE

00:25:59.991 --> 00:26:01.126
THE DETAILS THAT HAVE TO BE

00:26:01.192 --> 00:26:02.794
WORKED OUT ITS WHY THE PROGRAM

00:26:02.861 --> 00:26:04.129
IS NOT BEING ESTABLISHED RIGHT

00:26:04.195 --> 00:26:06.197
NOW BUT CERTAINLY AS PART OF

00:26:06.264 --> 00:26:07.165
ANY MACINNES OVERSIGHT

00:26:07.232 --> 00:26:09.100
MECHANISMS HE WOULD HAVE TO

00:26:09.167 --> 00:26:11.202
CREATE AN INVESTMENT POLICY

00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:12.604
SIMILAR TO YOU KNOW HOW OTHER

00:26:12.671 --> 00:26:13.772
BIG ANNOUNCEMENTS ARE PENSION

00:26:13.838 --> 00:26:15.774
FUNDS ARE RAIMES WHEN HE

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.976
RETURNED IS NOT WHAT YOU EXPECT

00:26:18.043 --> 00:26:19.077
TO HAVE TO CONSIDER HOW YOU

00:26:19.144 --> 00:26:21.112
MIGHT REACT TO THAT SO THOSE

00:26:21.179 --> 00:26:22.280
ARE ALL ELEMENTS WHERE THEY'RE

00:26:22.347 --> 00:26:23.315
BEING OVERSIGHT BOARD THERE'D

00:26:23.381 --> 00:26:25.784
BE AN INVESTMENT COMMITTEE OR

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:27.519
PERSON RESPONSIBLE WITH

00:26:27.585 --> 00:26:29.721
OVERSIGHT FROM THAT. APPOINTEES

00:26:29.788 --> 00:26:31.323
TO THAT BOARD AND SO THAT'S

00:26:31.389 --> 00:26:32.824
SOMETHING WHERE TO USE AT A

00:26:32.891 --> 00:26:34.526
SLIGHTLY LOWER RATE OF RETURN

00:26:34.592 --> 00:26:35.860

AND DOWNS OF THE MARKET NOT

00:26:40.765 --> 00:26:41.299
HAVE TO ADJUST FOR YOU SET UP

00:26:41.366 --> 00:26:43.234
HIGHER AND PERHAPS THAT MORE

00:26:43.301 --> 00:26:45.036
AVERAGE EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN

00:26:45.103 --> 00:26:46.438
AND THEN WHEN IT DOES GO LOW

00:26:46.504 --> 00:26:47.639
FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AS WE SAW

00:26:47.706 --> 00:26:49.140
IN THE GREAT RECESSION YOU

THAT SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE

00:26:53.078 --> 00:26:54.179
WORKED OUT AND IT'S WHY

00:26:54.245 --> 00:26:55.213
REQUIRES ADDITIONAL STUDY

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.983
BECAUSE THAT IS A- QUESTION

00:26:58.049 --> 00:26:59.217
THAT IS THERE IS NO SIMPLE

00:26:59.284 --> 00:27:04.389
ANSWER TO THAT. WELL. IT

00:27:04.456 --> 00:27:04.990

A FAIR AMOUNT OF CONCERN OVER

THIS. IT WOULD APPEAR TO ME

00:30:29.294 --> 00:30:29.894

LOCAL AND REGIONAL COORDINATION

00:44:53.657 --> 00:44:54.958
FOR THE TYPES OF ISSUES THAT

00:44:55.025 --> 00:44:56.460
THESE THE IRAQIS WERE DESIGNED

00:44:56.527 --> 00:44:57.995
TO ADDRESS. IN ADDITION THIS

00:44:58.062 --> 00:44:59.730
TRAILER BILL WOULD REQUIRE

00:44:59.797 --> 00:45:01.331
ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORTING FROM

00:45:01.398 --> 00:45:01.965
THE AND HAS INTRODUCED

00:45:02.032 --> 00:45:03.767
INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING

00:45:03.834 --> 00:45:05.269
DISTRICTS AND HAPPY TO TAKE ANY

00:45:05.335 --> 00:45:10.340
QUESTIONS. ON QUESTIONS

00:45:10.407 --> 00:45:17.915
COMMITTEE MEMBERS THIRD AVAIL.

00:45:17.981 --> 00:45:19.616
BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN

00:45:19.683 --> 00:45:20.717
ARE OFFERED THE REGIONAL I HAVE

00:45:20.784 --> 00:45:23.921
THE I'VE D. BILL WHICH HAD. ON

00:45:23.987 --> 00:45:25.322
VOTING REQUIREMENTS THIS BILL

00:45:25.389 --> 00:45:26.423
DOES AWAY WITH THAT BUT IT DOES

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:27.024
AWAY WITH IT AND PUTS IN THE

00:45:27.091 --> 00:45:29.059
STATUTE. SOME OF WHAT I

00:45:29.126 --> 00:45:32.162
CONSIDER TO BE MESSY LANGUAGE.

00:45:32.229 --> 00:45:35.766
FOR EXAMPLE THE OLD BILL HAD

00:45:35.833 --> 00:45:36.667
REGISTERED VOTERS THIS BILL

00:45:36.733 --> 00:45:39.436
SAYS RESIDENTS. I MEAN WHO WHO

00:45:39.503 --> 00:45:41.238
IS A RESIDENT OF ANYBODY OVER

00:45:41.305 --> 00:45:44.108
EIGHTEEN. SO IT'S MESSY THIS

00:45:44.174 --> 00:45:46.410
BILL BILL HAD LAND OWNERS AND

00:45:46.477 --> 00:45:48.579
IT BASS THE LAND OWNERS BASED

00:45:48.645 --> 00:45:50.647
ON THE NUMBER OF ACRES THEY OWN

00:45:50.714 --> 00:45:51.348
SO WE HAD LIKE A

00:45:51.415 --> 00:45:53.517
PROPORTIONALITY IN TERMS OF.

00:45:53.584 --> 00:45:55.719
THE SIZE OF THE PROPERTY A

00:45:55.786 --> 00:45:57.888
PARCEL ON BY THE LANDLORD THIS

00:45:57.955 --> 00:45:59.389
BILL HAS NO TO THOSE KIND OF

00:45:59.456 --> 00:46:01.592
COMMENTS SO ESSENTIALLY WHAT IT

00:46:01.658 --> 00:46:03.727
WHAT IT DOES IS IT GIVES THE

00:46:03.794 --> 00:46:06.497
SAME NUMBER OF VOTES FOR OF A

00:46:06.563 --> 00:46:07.998
RESIDENT THAT'S LIVING IN AN

00:46:08.065 --> 00:46:10.067
APARTMENT. AS SOMEBODY OWNS A

00:46:10.134 --> 00:46:11.168
PIECE OF PROPERTY THAT MIGHT BE

00:46:11.235 --> 00:46:13.470
SIGNIFICANT I'VE I FIND THAT

00:46:13.537 --> 00:46:17.941
KIND OF MESSY I THINK THAT'S.

00:46:18.008 --> 00:46:18.542
SOMETHING THAT PROBABLY IN THE

00:46:18.609 --> 00:46:22.713
FUTURE WE NEED TO CLEAN UP. IS

00:46:22.779 --> 00:46:26.016
NOT PROPORTIONATE TO YOU KNOW

00:46:26.083 --> 00:46:27.351
THE IS SAYS ANYBODY OVER

00:46:27.417 --> 00:46:28.285
EIGHTEEN SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO

00:46:28.352 --> 00:46:29.686
BE A REGISTERED VOTER YOU KNOW

00:46:29.753 --> 00:46:31.388
HOW DO YOU DETERMINE WHO'S A

00:46:31.455 --> 00:46:34.024
RESIDENT IN TERMS OF THE

00:46:34.091 --> 00:46:35.292
PROTEST PROVISIONS SO IT

00:46:35.359 --> 00:46:40.364
CREATES A- TO ME MESSY STANDARD

00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:41.431
FOR ANYBODY TRYING TO CREATE

00:46:41.498 --> 00:46:44.067
THESE WHICH TO ME MEANS THAT IT

00:46:44.134 --> 00:46:49.273
WOULD LIMIT THE. ABILITY OF

00:46:49.339 --> 00:46:52.342
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO USE THESE.

00:46:52.409 --> 00:46:53.143
ENHANCE INFRASTRUCTURE

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:54.178
FINANCING DISTRICTS I LIKE TO

00:46:54.244 --> 00:46:56.346
SEE THIS LANGUAGE CLEANED UP.

00:46:56.413 --> 00:46:57.214
WE SHOULD WORK ON IT I POINTED

00:46:57.281 --> 00:46:59.883
THIS OUT TO PEOPLE THE BILL

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:02.686
WASN'T CHANGED BUT I INTEND TO.

00:47:02.753 --> 00:47:05.222
CONTINUE TO WORK ON. OF TRYING

00:47:05.289 --> 00:47:06.356
TO CLEAN UP THIS MESS THE

00:47:06.423 --> 00:47:08.158
LANGUAGE IN THE FUTURE I THINK

00:47:08.225 --> 00:47:10.260
IT HAS TO BE CLEANED UP TO MAKE

00:47:10.327 --> 00:47:12.229
THESE. INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING

00:47:12.296 --> 00:47:14.865
DISTRICTS MORE EFFECTIVE THE

00:47:14.932 --> 00:47:18.368
ORIGINAL BILL. OF CREATED IN

00:47:18.435 --> 00:47:18.936
TWENTY FOURTEEN WAS ONLY USE

00:47:19.002 --> 00:47:21.438
BUT I THINKTHREE WE ONLY HAD

00:47:21.505 --> 00:47:22.806
THREE SUCCESSFUL.

00:47:22.873 --> 00:47:23.774
INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:27.678
DISTRICTS CREATED. AND I THINK

00:47:27.744 --> 00:47:28.879
THIS MESSY LANGUAGE MIGHT

00:47:28.946 --> 00:47:31.915
INHIBIT US. AND LIMIT ITS USE

00:47:31.982 --> 00:47:33.684
IN TWO WEEKS WE CLEAN THIS UP

00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:36.286
SO. I SUPPORT THIS TODAY I

00:47:36.353 --> 00:47:39.523
THINK WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO

00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:43.560
WORK ON CLEAN THIS UP. AND.

00:47:43.627 --> 00:47:44.595

CONCERN ABOUT THAT. THIS SO

00:48:00.777 --> 00:48:05.349
CALLED PROTEST PROVISIONS. IT'S

00:48:05.415 --> 00:48:09.853
JUST AN EASY WAY OUT. IT'S AN

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:10.787
EASY WAY TO SAY WE DID

00:48:10.854 --> 00:48:12.489
SOMETHING WHEN YOU REALLY DON'T

00:48:25.369 --> 00:48:29.406
PROBLEMATIC. IN THE BE USED. IN

00:48:29.473 --> 00:48:32.142
REMOVED. AND NOW THERE'S A

00:48:32.209 --> 00:48:33.710
CREEPING WAY. TO BRING THEM

00:48:33.777 --> 00:48:37.848
BACK. WITH I WOULD ARGUE EVEN

00:48:37.914 --> 00:48:40.350

FROM CENTER BILL THAT IT'S

00:48:54.231 --> 00:48:55.565
ACTUALLY QUITE THE OPPOSITE

00:48:55.632 --> 00:48:57.200
EFFECT OF DIS EMPOWERING THAT

00:48:57.267 --> 00:48:59.069
IT MAY BE OVER EMPOWERS THOSE

OPENNESS TO. MAKING THIS

00:49:07.144 --> 00:49:08.211
FUNCTIONAL BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN

MULTI JURISDICTIONAL REGION

00:49:15.452 --> 00:49:17.254
THAT NEEDS THIS KIND OF

00:49:17.321 --> 00:49:18.855
DISTRICT TO BE COHESIVE IN

00:49:18.922 --> 00:49:21.224
FINANCE SYMBOL AND WE THINK

00:49:21.291 --> 00:49:22.893
THERE'S A PLAN TO DO THAT BUT-

00:49:22.959 --> 00:49:25.095
WE GOT TO. SORT THROUGH SOME OF

00:49:25.162 --> 00:49:25.696

WORKING WITH MEMBERS OF THE

00:49:37.774 --> 00:49:39.343
LEGISLATURE IS TO GET MORE OF

00:49:39.409 --> 00:49:40.377
THESE DISTRICTS FORMED IN

00:49:40.444 --> 00:49:42.212
PLACES WHERE THEY ARE USEFUL

00:49:42.279 --> 00:49:43.313
AND THE REASON WE PUT IN THESE

00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:45.282
PROVISIONS ARE TO ADDRESS

00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:46.550

VOTERS AND THE FINANCING LAN

00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:58.295
DOES NOT MOVE FORWARD SO THAT'S

00:49:58.362 --> 00:49:59.229
THE GOAL THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

00:49:59.296 --> 00:50:01.264
