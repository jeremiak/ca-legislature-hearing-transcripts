OUR MISTER US THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND FOR SOME TO THANK GOD- MY COLLEAGUES MEMBER BUT WE- FOR ALL OR ENORMOUS A- HELPING ON THIS AND COFFEE NINE THIS BILL- THE BILL IS VERY POOR TO OUR COMMUNITY. AND WE'RE GOING TO PER ME COST SAVINGS FOR THE STATE IT'S A MODEL FOR PRODUCING MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND ENHANCING AND BUILDING WEALTH THROUGH HOMEOWNERSHIP. AND SB FIFTY ONE ALIGNS WITH- GOVERNOR NUISANCE EXECUTIVE ACTIONS TO FOSTER HOUSING INNOVATION ON EXCESS STATE LAND AND RAPIDLY INCREASE THE HOUSING OPTIONS. SO IT'S A PROVIDES A PATHWAY TO HOMEOWNERSHIP BUT IT ALLOWS FOR THE SALE OF CALTRANS PROPERTIES TO QUALIFIED HOUSING RELATED ENTITIES SUCH AS AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND NONPROFIT HOUSING ENTITIES AT THE CALTRANS ORIGINAL PRICE PURCHASE. IN EXCHANGE FOR A GUARANTEE A PROVIDING FIFTY FIVE YEARS OF AFFORDABLE AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSING. AN HR WE WILL BE ABLE TO BUY THE PROPERTY AT THE ORIGINAL PRICE BUT IN EXCHANGE FOR REMODELING PRESERVING AFFORDABILITY AND MAINTAINING THEM. OVER FIFTY YEARS CALTRANS BOUGHT HNDREDS OF PROPERTIES ALONG THE SEVEN TEN CORRIDOR. IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES- PASADENA SOUTH PASADENA- THEY WERE PREPARING TO BUILD A FREEWAY. IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY THE LEGISLATURE DECLARED THERE WOULD BE NO FREE BABY BUILT THROUGH THESE CITIES SB FIFTY ONE ONLY APPLIES TO THE PROPERTIES WHICH ARE THE MAJORITY IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES DUE TO THIS OPPORTUNITY NEARLY ONE HUNDRED HOMES ARE CURRENTLY UNOCCUPIED. MANY ARE IN POOR CONDITION WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REPAIR AND IMPROVE THE HOUSING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AT NO COST TO THE STATE AND TO INCREASE LONG TERM AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA. IT IS ALSO FISCALLY PRUDENT RIGHT NOW CALTRANS IS REQUIRED TO FIX THE HOMES IN ORDER TO SELL THE PROPERTIES. AS MOST OF THESE HOMES WOULD NOT QUALIFY FOR HABITABILITY STANDARDS CALTRANS IS ALSO INCURRING SIGNIFICANT COSTS. TO PREVENT HOMES FROM BEING OCCUPIED WITHOUT PERMISSION. SO COLLEAGUES THIS BILL MOVES US SIX TO MOVE OWNERSHIP AWAY FROM CALTRANS. INTO THE HANDS OF INDIVIDUAL OWNERS SECURE AFFORDABILITY AND INCREASE THE NUMBER OF AFFORDABLE UNITS AND PROTECT CURRENT ALL CALTRANS TENANTS. LASTLY IF VACANT PROPERTIES WERE TO GO THROUGH EXISTING RULES THEY WOULD BE OPTIONED UP. OFF OPEN TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER AND THAT WOULD BE A RECENT RECIPE FOR DISPLACEMENT AND GENTRIFICATION.
