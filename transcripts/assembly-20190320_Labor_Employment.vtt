UNDERSTAND HOW THAT WOULD BE

00:35:48.145 --> 00:35:49.447
PROBLEMATIC --

00:35:49.514 --> 00:35:51.015
THE EMPLOYERS CONCERN IS THAT

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:57.355
CALIFORNIA WAGE ORDERS AND

00:35:57.421 --> 00:35:58.689

RIGHT WHO NEEDS TO BE AROUND

00:36:02.627 --> 00:36:03.828
BECAUSE PART OF THEIR JOB IS

00:36:03.895 --> 00:36:05.062
BEING PRESENT FOR THOSE

00:36:05.129 --> 00:36:06.697
SITUATIONS --

00:36:06.764 --> 00:36:07.932
ANOTHER EXAMPLE THAT --

AND I I'VE AGAIN WILL NOT TAKE

00:36:09.967 --> 00:36:11.168
SIX MINUTES WITH THIS BUT

00:36:11.235 --> 00:36:13.271
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A GOOD FRIEND

00:36:13.337 --> 00:36:14.238
OF MINE WENT THROUGH WAS WORKING

00:36:14.305 --> 00:36:15.373
AS A GARDEN INDUSTRIAL PLANT IN

00:36:15.439 --> 00:36:16.941
STOCKTON WHERE HE NEEDED TO BE

00:36:17.008 --> 00:36:18.242
ON SITE THAT NIGHT OTHERWISE

00:36:18.309 --> 00:36:18.943
SOMEONE WOULD STEAL THE

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:20.912
EQUIPMENT AND SO HE SLEPT AND

00:36:20.978 --> 00:36:21.379
STAYED.

00:36:21.445 --> 00:36:22.013
AT THAT SITE WHILE HE WAS DOING

00:36:22.079 --> 00:36:23.447
THAT JOB I DON'T BELIEVE THOSE

00:36:23.514 --> 00:36:25.216
OF THE YOU KNOW THE INTENDED

00:36:25.283 --> 00:36:26.651
CONSEQUENCE HERE BUT THE CHAMBER

00:36:26.717 --> 00:36:27.618
IS A CONCERN THAT THIS COULD

00:36:27.685 --> 00:36:28.986
LEAD TO UNINTENDED LITIGATION

00:36:29.053 --> 00:36:32.290
FOR EMPLOYERS WHO.

00:36:32.356 --> 00:36:33.491
ARE NOT REALLY THAT AIM HERE --

00:36:33.558 --> 00:36:34.091
SO BECAUSE OF THAT BURDEN AND

IT.

00:44:42.379 --> 00:44:47.017
pUNFORTUNATELY THE FACT THAT

00:44:47.084 --> 00:44:48.252
THERE IS NOT A DEFINITION AND

00:44:48.318 --> 00:44:49.820
THE PREVAILING WAGE ACT FOR THIS

00:44:49.887 --> 00:44:51.321
TERM HAS LED TO AS OPEN A

00:44:51.388 --> 00:44:52.389
LOOPHOLE --

00:44:52.456 --> 00:44:53.524
THAT HAS BEEN EXPLOITED

00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:54.758
UNFORTUNATELY --

00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:58.796
OF FOR PROFIT PRIVATE DEVELOPERS --

00:44:58.862 --> 00:45:00.297
MISTER KALRA GIVE A VERY GOOD

00:45:00.364 --> 00:45:01.432
EXAMPLE --

00:45:01.498 --> 00:45:04.334
OF D. I. R. DETERMINATION --

00:45:04.401 --> 00:45:05.936
OF A VERY LARGE AMOUNT OF PUBLIC

00:45:06.003 --> 00:45:06.937
MONEY THAT WENT TO A PROJECT

00:45:07.004 --> 00:45:08.272
THAT DID NOT THEN TRIGGERED THE

00:45:08.338 --> 00:45:09.640
BRICK BRICK PREVAILING WAGE --

00:45:09.706 --> 00:45:11.775
THERE WAS ANOTHER ONE TWENTY

00:45:11.842 --> 00:45:12.709
SIXTEEN THAT WAS FIVE HUNDRED

00:45:12.776 --> 00:45:14.945

THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:45:16.814 --> 00:45:18.682
SO THERE'S A REAL ISSUE HERE --

00:45:18.749 --> 00:45:21.118
WE NEED A DEFINITION --

00:45:21.185 --> 00:45:23.654

GO TO A PROJECT AND WE BELIEVE

00:45:29.259 --> 00:45:30.594
TAXPAYER DOLLARS SHOULD GO TO

THE PORTION OF THE PROJECT THAT

00:49:08.912 --> 00:49:10.280
IS TO THE BENEFIT OF TOSE

00:49:10.347 --> 00:49:12.282
FUTURE PROJECTS SO IT'S NOT TO

00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:13.684
THE BENEFIT.

00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:15.919
OF THE FIRST IN PROJECT --

00:49:15.986 --> 00:49:17.788
DOING THAT HAS HUGE BENEFITS FOR

00:49:17.854 --> 00:49:20.357
EVERYBODY IN THE COMMUNITY SO --

00:49:20.424 --> 00:49:22.793
YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT GETTING --

00:49:22.859 --> 00:49:24.127
ALL THE WORK ASSOCIATED WITH

00:49:24.194 --> 00:49:26.229
TEARING UP STREETS AND SIDEWALKS

00:49:26.296 --> 00:49:28.432
AND NOISE AND TRAFFIC GETTING

00:49:28.498 --> 00:49:30.634
ALL THAT STUFF DONE FIRST

00:49:30.701 --> 00:49:32.002
RELIEVES IT FOR THOSE FUTURE

00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:33.303
PROJECTS SO WHETHER IT'S THE

00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:34.604
HOMEOWNERS LIVING IN THE AREA --

00:49:34.671 --> 00:49:36.273
BUSINESSES THAT HAVE TO CONTEND

00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:37.908
WITH THEIR STREETS AND SIDEWALKS

00:49:37.974 --> 00:49:40.143
BEING TORN UP WE CAN GET THOSE

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:41.411
THINGS ACCOMPLISHED FIRST --

00:49:41.478 --> 00:49:42.913
AND EARLY IN THE PROJECT

00:49:42.979 --> 00:49:43.880
DEVELOPMENT.

00:49:43.947 --> 00:49:46.316
SO AGAIN YOU KNOW WE ARE NOT --

00:49:46.383 --> 00:49:48.318
HERE OPPOSING ALL THE ASPECTS OF

00:49:48.385 --> 00:49:50.954
THE BILL WE BELIEVE THAT THE 2% --

00:49:51.021 --> 00:49:54.491
IN OUR VIEW HAS BEEN WELL INTO

00:49:54.558 --> 00:49:58.595
DISCUSSED IN THE IT'S BEEN VERY

00:49:58.662 --> 00:50:00.831
CLEAR THAT EVEN OVER TIME IN THE

00:50:00.897 --> 00:50:02.332
LAST EIGHTEEN YEARS.

00:50:02.399 --> 00:50:03.834
THAT CONSTRUCTION COSTS CONTINUE

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:04.901
TO RISE AND I THINK WE'RE ALL

00:50:04.968 --> 00:50:06.169
WELL AWARE OF THAT.

00:50:06.236 --> 00:50:08.205
SO EVEN WITH THAT WE EXPECT

00:50:08.271 --> 00:50:09.706
CONSTRUCTION COSTS ARISE IN THE

00:50:09.773 --> 00:50:11.608
FUTURE AND SO WE STRUGGLE WITH

00:50:11.675 --> 00:50:13.643
THE THOUGHT OF HAVING A HARD AND

00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:15.879
FAST NUMBER IN STATUTE IN PLACE

00:50:15.946 --> 00:50:17.681
AND IT NOT BE A PERCENTAGE OF OF

YOU MADAM CHAIR OF I HAVE A

00:50:38.435 --> 00:50:39.536
QUESTION FOR THE FOR THE AUTHOR

00:50:39.603 --> 00:50:40.270
IS THAT --

00:50:40.337 --> 00:50:41.271
WOULD --

00:50:41.338 --> 00:50:43.240
WOULD HE BE OPEN --

00:50:43.306 --> 00:50:44.941
TO JUST STICKING WITH THE 2% AND

00:50:45.008 --> 00:50:47.611
AND MAYBE NOT A NOT NOT PUT A

00:50:47.677 --> 00:50:48.945
FIXED NUMBER --

00:50:49.012 --> 00:50:50.547
NOT PUT A FIXED DOLLAR AMOUNT ON

00:50:50.614 --> 00:50:51.982
THE BILL.

00:50:52.048 --> 00:50:53.517
BECAUSE THINGS DO CHANGE AND

00:50:53.583 --> 00:50:57.788
WITHIN --

00:50:57.854 --> 00:50:59.222
FOUR THAT THAT TWO EIGHTY

00:50:59.289 --> 00:51:00.824
THOUSAND ALL SEEM AWFULLY LOW.

00:51:00.891 --> 00:51:02.726
WELL UP THANKS FOR THE QUESTION

00:51:02.793 --> 00:51:04.861
THE SEVERITY OF THE THE PROBLEM

00:51:04.928 --> 00:51:07.964
AS EXEMPLIFIED BY WHAT BUT ONE

00:51:08.031 --> 00:51:10.667
OF THE EXAMPLES IS THE THE

00:51:10.734 --> 00:51:12.769
PROCESSING FACILITY I HAD THAT --

00:51:12.836 --> 00:51:14.271
COST NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS

00:51:14.337 --> 00:51:16.039
SINCE THE SUBSIDY WAS ONE POINT

00:51:16.106 --> 00:51:17.507
SIX MILLION IT ONLY AMOUNTED TO

00:51:17.574 --> 00:51:18.975
ONE POINT 75%.

00:51:19.042 --> 00:51:22.145
AND SO I THINK THAT THE PROBLEM

00:51:22.212 --> 00:51:23.413
WITH THE PERCENTAGES THAT.

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:25.182
YOU'LL PROJECTS OF THE SIZE OF

00:51:25.248 --> 00:51:26.349
THE PROJECT IS NOT NESTLE

00:51:26.416 --> 00:51:28.452
ACCOUNTED FOR AND THE REALITY IS

00:51:28.518 --> 00:51:29.519
THAT I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT

00:51:29.586 --> 00:51:31.988
IF THERE'S AT ANY AMOUNT OF

00:51:32.055 --> 00:51:33.523
PUBLIC SUBSIDIES SUBSIDY.

00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:35.725
THAT IS OF A SIGNIFICANT VALUE

00:51:35.792 --> 00:51:37.694
AND I I BELIEVE TWO HUNDRED

00:51:37.761 --> 00:51:38.361
SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IS

00:51:38.428 --> 00:51:39.763
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TAXPAYER

00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:41.031
MONEY -- A

00:51:41.097 --> 00:51:43.366
PUBLIC SUBSIDY AND SO I'M I'M

00:51:43.433 --> 00:51:44.768
GOING TO STICK TO THAT I'M OPEN

00:51:44.835 --> 00:51:46.303
TO SUGGESTIONS --

00:51:46.369 --> 00:51:48.271
GOING FORWARD THOUGH --

00:51:48.338 --> 00:51:49.806
BUT BUT I I DO BELIEVE THAT'S A

00:51:49.873 --> 00:51:51.508
CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THE BILL

00:51:51.575 --> 00:51:53.743
IT IS NOT JUST A PERCENTAGE BUT

00:51:53.810 --> 00:51:55.312
THE ACTUAL AMOUNT AND I THINK

00:51:55.378 --> 00:51:56.580
THAT I BELIEVE TUNERS ANY BY

00:51:56.646 --> 00:51:58.615
THOUSANDS OF PARAMOUNT. TO BE A

00:51:58.682 --> 00:52:00.484
FOUNDATIONAL AMOUNT IN TERMS OF

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:01.918
WHAT PUT THE PUBLIC SHOULD

00:52:01.985 --> 00:52:08.492
EXPECT IN TERMS OF THE QUALITY --

00:52:08.558 --> 00:52:13.396
IN KIND OF A WAIT.

00:52:13.463 --> 00:52:14.498
IF IF THAT IS THE CASE WITH AND

00:52:14.564 --> 00:52:15.165
AND WE DON'T WANT TO DO IT RIGHT

00:52:15.232 --> 00:52:17.801
NOW BUT WOULD YOU BE OPEN --

00:52:17.868 --> 00:52:18.768
TO PUTTING IN SOME SORT OF LAW

00:52:18.835 --> 00:52:20.303
THAT WILL ALLOW THAT THAT FIX

00:52:20.370 --> 00:52:22.672
DOLLAR TO RISE WITH INFLATION

00:52:22.739 --> 00:52:24.608
EVERY YEAR.

00:52:24.674 --> 00:52:25.742
I'M OPEN.

00:56:55.311 --> 00:56:57.080

REFERRED THEM TO CAL OSHA.

00:57:51.901 --> 00:57:52.936
THE BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE

WAS VETOED LAST YEAR FOR TWO

00:57:59.809 --> 00:58:01.377
REASONS BOTH OF WHICH WERE

PENDING REGULATIONS BY CAL OSHA.

00:58:06.282 --> 00:58:08.351
AND THAT WAS INDEED THE SUBJECT

00:58:08.418 --> 00:58:09.219

THAT IS ABOUT LEAD LEVELS IN THE

00:58:14.557 --> 00:58:15.625
AIR DOES NOTHING TO DO WITH

00:58:15.692 --> 00:58:16.893
BLOOD LEVELS AS NOTHING DO

REASON FREDO THERE AND THE OTHER

00:58:22.098 --> 00:58:23.066

00:58:27.971 --> 00:58:30.173
WHAT TURNS OUT THEY SAY THEY DO

00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:31.774
BUT THEY JUST DON'T GET ANYTHING

00:58:31.841 --> 00:58:32.442
DONE.

00:58:32.508 --> 00:58:34.344

THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO ENFORCE

00:59:14.550 --> 00:59:16.152
THAT IF THIS BILL WAS IN PLACE

00:59:16.219 --> 00:59:17.487

01:01:04.193 --> 01:01:05.328
THIRTY FIVE OUR CONCERN IS AB

01:01:05.395 --> 01:01:06.295
THIRTY FIVE YOU SERBS OSHA'S

TRADITIONAL RULEMAKING ROLLING

01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:08.698
BUT ALSO CREATE CONTRA

01:01:08.765 --> 01:01:10.266
RESTRAINED IT'S GOING FORWARD.

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:11.701
I'M IN LIGHT OF WHAT WAS

01:01:11.768 --> 01:01:12.802
DISCUSSED JUST A MOMENT AGO AS

01:01:12.869 --> 01:01:14.871
NOTED UNDER EIGHTY FOUR FIFTY

01:01:14.937 --> 01:01:16.139
SEVEN THERE IS A ONGOING RULE

01:01:16.205 --> 01:01:16.973
MAKING PROCESS THAT WE THINK%

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:17.907
THIS.

01:01:17.974 --> 01:01:19.242
THIS GETS IN THE WAY OF TWO I'M

01:01:19.308 --> 01:01:20.176
REALLY REFERENCE BACK TO THE

01:01:20.243 --> 01:01:21.577
GOVERNOR BROWN TO VETO MESSAGE

01:01:21.644 --> 01:01:23.713
OF A BETWEEN NINE SIXTY THREE

01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:24.013
LAST YEAR.

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:25.548
INSIDE THE SAME CONCERNS AND IF

01:01:25.615 --> 01:01:27.350
I COULD BRIEFLY I'M I BELIEVE

01:01:27.417 --> 01:01:29.585
THAT ONE OF THE POINTS MADE --

01:01:29.652 --> 01:01:31.087
IN SUPPORT ABOUT --

01:01:31.154 --> 01:01:33.756
THE PRIOR BILL FORTY SEVEN THAT

01:01:33.823 --> 01:01:35.124
WE JUST HEARD IS IS IN CORRECTED.

01:01:35.191 --> 01:01:37.126
I MAY HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD BUT I

01:01:37.193 --> 01:01:37.693
BELIEVE THE COMMENT WAS THAT

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:41.297
THAT APPLY TO USE ONE TOPIC

01:01:41.364 --> 01:01:42.865
WHICH WAS JUST THE AIR --

01:01:42.932 --> 01:01:44.801
HAVING SPOKEN TO THE AUTHOR ON

01:01:44.867 --> 01:01:45.468
FORTY SEVEN I BELIEVE THE INTENT

01:01:45.535 --> 01:01:46.803
IS TO AMEND THAT TO INCLUDE ALL

01:01:46.869 --> 01:01:47.703
OF THE TOPICS THE NEW

01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:49.105
REGULATIONS WILL COVER.

01:01:49.172 --> 01:01:50.073
SO I BELIEVE THAT ACTUALLY ITIS

01:01:50.139 --> 01:01:51.474
BROADER THAN --

01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:52.842
THEN WHAT WAS STATED HEARING

01:01:52.909 --> 01:01:56.479
WILL ADDRESS MORE ISSUES --

01:01:56.546 --> 01:01:58.347
TRYING TO OURS AND I HOPE I DID

01:01:58.414 --> 01:01:59.682
MISUNDERSTAND A COMMON BUT

01:01:59.749 --> 01:02:02.185
TURNING TO OUR TO SPECIFIC

01:02:02.251 --> 01:02:02.718
CONCERNS.

01:02:02.785 --> 01:02:03.986
FIRST -- IN

01:02:04.053 --> 01:02:04.587
HOW THIS WILL CREATE A

01:02:04.654 --> 01:02:06.622
CONTRADICTORY RELATION TO THE

01:02:06.689 --> 01:02:07.924
PRESENT STANDARDS --

01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:09.125
THE PRESENT STANDARDS IN AGAIN

01:02:09.192 --> 01:02:10.493
THEY MAY CHANGE BUT THE CONCERN

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:11.828
WILL STILL APPLY --

01:02:11.894 --> 01:02:13.830
THE PRESENT STANDARDS UNDER OSHO

01:02:13.896 --> 01:02:15.298
REQUIRE --

01:02:15.364 --> 01:02:17.266
BLOOD TESTING AND I'LL I'LL TRY

01:02:17.333 --> 01:02:19.068
TO BE CLEAR AT THIS A BLOOD

01:02:19.135 --> 01:02:20.103
TESTING --

01:02:20.169 --> 01:02:21.804
CAN BE ENDED IF IT IS FOR TWO

01:02:21.871 --> 01:02:23.473
TESTS IN A ROW WORKERS BLOOD

01:02:23.539 --> 01:02:24.874
LEVELS BELOW THIRTY MICROGRAMS.

01:02:24.941 --> 01:02:26.576
I'M HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:02:26.642 --> 01:02:30.012
TESTING DPH BEING REQUIRED TO

01:02:30.079 --> 01:02:31.247
FORWARD TO OSHA AND SHOULD

01:02:31.314 --> 01:02:32.882
CONSIDER A SERIOUS VIOLATION.

01:02:32.949 --> 01:02:35.418
AT A LEVEL OF TWENTY FIVE I

01:02:35.485 --> 01:02:37.220
BELIEVE THE MOMENTS WERE --

01:02:37.286 --> 01:02:38.287
TWENTY TWENTY MICROGRAMS SO

01:02:38.354 --> 01:02:38.921
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT COMPELLING

01:02:38.988 --> 01:02:40.123
OSHA TO DO AN URGENT

01:02:40.189 --> 01:02:42.125
INVESTIGATION AT A LEVEL BELOW

01:02:42.191 --> 01:02:43.926
WHAT IS PRESENTLY EVEN --

01:02:43.993 --> 01:02:45.761
THE LEVEL THAT THE EMPLOYER MUST

01:02:45.828 --> 01:02:47.096
KEEP TESTING.

01:02:47.163 --> 01:02:48.564
SO AND NOT TO GET INTO THE

01:02:48.631 --> 01:02:49.899
MERITS OF THOSE BUT JUST TO SHOW

01:02:49.966 --> 01:02:50.967
THAT THAT IS A CONTRADICTORY

01:02:51.033 --> 01:02:52.168
STANDARD THE BUSINESS WE HAVE TO

01:02:52.235 --> 01:02:53.369
LOOK TO WHEN.

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:54.837
TESTING IS NOT AN ONGOING

01:02:54.904 --> 01:02:56.239
REQUIRED AT THIS LEVEL BUT

01:02:56.305 --> 01:02:58.107
OSHA'S INVESTIGATION MUST HAPPEN

01:02:58.174 --> 01:02:58.841
URGENTLY.

01:02:58.908 --> 01:03:00.176
I'M AND THAT CONTRADICTORY

01:03:00.243 --> 01:03:02.211
POSSIBILITY MIGHT EXIST GOING

01:03:02.278 --> 01:03:03.446
FORWARD AND FUTURE REGULATIONS

01:03:03.513 --> 01:03:04.580
AS WELL AGAIN THOSE HAVEN'T BEEN

01:03:04.647 --> 01:03:06.282
FINALIZED BUT THAT IS OUR

01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:06.849
CONCERN THAT THIS WILL PUT

01:03:06.916 --> 01:03:10.186
CONTRADICTORY REQUIREMENTS IN

01:03:10.253 --> 01:03:11.354
FRONT OF EMPLOYERS --

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:12.421
SECOND I BELIEVE THE PRESENT

01:03:12.488 --> 01:03:14.957
TENSE OF OF THE BILL DOES NOT
