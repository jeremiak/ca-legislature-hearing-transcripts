I WANT TO ALSO TAKE A MINUTE TO BE A WELCOME THE CHAIR OF BUDGET HERE TODAY MR TANG. AT ISSUE NUMBER ONE IS GOING TO BE OUR STATEWIDE CORRECTIONAL VIDEO SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM. IN OUR OF OUR PALACE ARE READY THEY CAN BEGIN. CAPITAL HERE IN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MARIAN'S BERMAN I'M AN ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTION REHABILITATION. THIS REQUEST IS TO CONTINUE THE STATE WIDE CORRECTIONAL VIDEO SURVEILLANCE ROLLOUT. WHICH INCLUDES FUNDING IN POSITION TO DEPLOY SIX CAMERAS CAN ADDITIONAL PRISONS. AND BODY WORN CAMERAS AT FOR ADDITIONAL PRISONS. IT'S REQUEST ALSO PROVIDES FUNDING TO MANAGE TO MAINTAIN A RECORDED VIDEO. FIX THE BODY WORN ACT INCLUDED RE SOURCES FOR THE DEPARTMENT ALSO DEPLOY SIX CAMERAS AT FOUR PRISONS. SO THAT CONCLUDES MY INTRODUCTION NOW AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS. DO WE HAVE A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I THINK HE WOULD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NO SPECIFIC COMMENTS AT THIS TIME BUT AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE- YES OKAY THANK YOU AND I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE STORAGE OF. THE FOOTAGE- RIGHT NOW THE PLAN IS THE RECOMMENDATION THAT HAS COME FORWARD WITH. A NINETY DAY. STORAGE AND TO WONDER WHAT THE COFFEE FOR NINETY BASIS VERSUS FOR A WHOLE YEAR. AND I'M ASKING THIS QUESTION BECAUSE FOR THE TENTH COMPLAINTS THE COMPLAINTS SYSTEM TAKES A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAN NINETY DAYS. AND WORRIED ABOUT EVIDENCE THAT WE MIGHT LOSE TO HELP IN THOSE INVESTIGATIONS. WE HAVEN'T HI I'M TAMMY IRWIN I'M FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION AND ENTERPRISE INFORMATION. SERVICES AND WE HAVE NOT. CONDUCTED A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OF THE- COSTA VIDEO ANY LONGER THAN. NINETY DAYS BECAUSE IT WAS DEEMED AT RISK. RESPONSIBLE REASONABLE THAT- NINETY DAYS WAS A SUFFICIENT I'M AND MY HERE- EIGHTY THREE MEN. WILL BE ABLE TO SPEAK MORE TO THAT- BUT WE CAN IF NECESSARY TO GET YOU A- A COST FOR THAT. HOW HOW IS THAT DECIDED THE NINETY DAYS WAS RESPONSIBLE AND REASONABLE. WILTEL WISHLIST SIDE IT WAS AS IT RELATES TO RULES VIOLATION REPORTS THAT PROCESS TAKES FORTY FIVE DAYS. ALSO IF THERE IS A USE OF FORCE ON A CAR TRIP PERSON THE INSTITUTION EXECUTIVE REVIEW COMMITTEE WHAT READ THE HAS TO REVIEW THAT WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF THE INCIDENT. AND ALSO WITH OUR GRIEVANCE PROCESS THE INCARCERATED PERSONS THEY CAN SUBMIT GRIEVANCE WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OF THE EVENT. SO WE LOOKED AT FACTORS AS FAR AS YOU KNOW TIME BETWEEN INCIDENCES AND GRIEVANCES BEING FILED BUT IT'S CONSISTENT ALSO WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND OFFENDER EDUCATION THE POLICY. IMPLEMENTATION OF A ROBUST LIST OF ITEMS THAT RESULTED VIDEO FOOTAGE TO TRANSFERRED TO LONG TERM STORAGE. AND ALSO LIKE I COULD MENTION THE OFFENDER POPULATION WASN'T VERY WELL EDUCATED AND FOR THE MOST PART WE SEE THAT DATE. WHEN A FILE GRIEVANCES IS WELL WITHIN NINETY DAYS. SO I UNDERSTAND THE POLICIES THAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THEIR SON YOU PROPOSED PROCESS THAT WOULD ELIMINATE THE TIME LIMIT FOR STAFF COMPLAINTS FOR EXAMPLE AND FOR THE NINETY DAYS SENSE FOR THOSE. THE. I'M NOT CLEAR ON THAT A. B. IT IS A NEW POLICY YOU SAY THAT AGAIN YES YES THAT'S ANOTHER THING YOU POLICY OUT THERE ARE YOU PROPOSAL FOR A NEW POLICY. THAT WOULD ELIMINATE THE TIME LIMIT. FOR STAFF COMPLAINTS. OKAY WELL ANY ARE QUITE WILL SAY IS IF SOMEONE FILES A GRIEVANCE OR COMPLAINT AGAINST. AN EMPLOYEE. IF THEY DEAL WITH A NINETY DAY PERIOD WE HAVE THE FOOTAGE THAT THEY CAN REQUEST A PLACE TO BE YOU KNOW RECORDER CAN BE BOOKMARKED AND SAVED. IF IT WAS THE FALLOUT FOUR VIDEO MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WE WOULD STILL THOROUGHLY LOOK INTO THE INVESTIGATION SO IF SOMEONE REPORTED A YEAR LATER FOR THE REPORTED SIX MONTHS LATER AND THE FOOTAGE WASN'T FAIR WE WOULD STILL LOOK INTO A COMPLAINT. AND I LIKE TO KIND OF MENTION THAT YOU KNOW VIDEO FOOTAGE AND RECORDINGS IN EVIDENCE IT'S ONLY ONE TOOL THAT WE USE OUR TOOL BOX TO THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATE ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT OR PRISON RAPE ELIMINATION ALLEGATIONS OR ANY OTHER REASONS SET. A COURSE FOR A PERSON WITH FILE- THE FIRE. THE IT'S JUST TOLD IT'S A PRETTY. TOOL IT'S A TOOL THAT THE COURTS HAVE ASKED THIS TO IMPLEMENTED MORE PRESENTS. OUT THERE AND SO I THINK WHEN THE NINETY THE PROPOSAL WAS CREATED AROUND THE PREVIOUS ROLES AND MADE SENSE. I WOULD THINK NOW THAT WE THE RULES ARE CHANGING IN FOR SAP COMPLAINTS AND THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE. A AND AN INDEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME I THINK IT WOULD MAKE SENSE FOR US TO AT LEAST LOOK AT THE POTENTIAL FOR LONGER STORAGE AND WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN AS FAR AS PRICING AND- FAITH AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S ALSO CLOUT ISSUES OR SO FORTH BUT I DO THINK GIVEN THAN YOUR POLICY. MAYBE WE NEED TO RETHINK OF NINETY DAYS STILL ADEQUATE FOR WHERE THAT EVIDENCE BATTLING. UP DIRECTOR. OF THE SCHOOL SERVE. WHICH WANTED TO NOTE THAT. EVEN THOUGH THE POLICY IS CHANGING TO. ELIMINATE THE TIME CONSTRAINTS FOR FOLKS TO FILE- AND CLAIM. ON AVERAGE ALL OF THE MOST CLAIMS WERE FILED WITHIN THE TIME PERIOD I THE TIME PERIODS SO WE- JUST BEAUSE WE HAVE ARE HAVING A CHANGE IN THAT PROCESS IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT. WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT THEY WILL NOT. THEY WILL NOT FILE WITHIN A TIMELY MANNER AS WELL- THAT'S ALSO BASED ON THE FACT THAT WE HAD THIS. THAT A FACT NEW THERE ARE THESE ALL ROLES IN THIS SHORTER TIME WHEN THOUGH. I'M NOT SURE OF THE HERE IS GOING TO CHANGE AS FAR AS REPORTING IS CONCERNED NOW THAT WE HAVE A LONGER. TIME WINDOW. FOR PEOPLE TO COME FORWARD- AND SO I'M NOT SURE. I'M NOT SURE OF THE NINETY BASIS ADEQUATE. MAYBE IT IS BUT I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK INTO- PRINT DIFFERENT OPTIONS FOR US WITH MORE TIME FOR STORAGE FOR THESE VIDEOS SINCE. THESE VIDEOS ARE A POWERFUL PART OF THE PROCESS. THE MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS MISTER CHANG. WITH OFF UP IN THE FAMED LINE OF QUESTIONING SO QUESTION TO THE DEPARTMENT. HAS THERE BEEN THE CASE WERE ON. ANY ANY DELETED FOOTAGE WAS ACTUALLY NEEDED FOR A CASE BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY DELETED. THIS IS MISTRESS BERMAN RESTRICTING AS FAR AS MY KNOWLEDGE TO KNOW THAT I HAVEN'T HEARD ANY FOOTAGE BEING DELETED. THAT WAS NEEDED FOR. SOME TYPE OF INVESTIGATION WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE NINETY DAYS. MY DEFERRED AT INSIDE HOW HAVE MRS ERRING KIND EXPLAINED THAT VIDEO MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THE PROCESS VERY GOOD THANK YOU. ONCE HI THIS IS JAMIE ALLEN I'M ONCE VIDEO THERE IS A TRIGGERING EVENT IDENTIFIED THEN THE VIDEO IS THEN- TRANSITIONED TO LONGER TERM STORAGE- BUT WHERE IT HAS- SET PROTOCOLS. FOR STORAGE SO LIMITED ACCESS- READ ONLY TO THOSE WHO- NEED TO VIEW OR HAVE ACCESS TO THE VIDEO. GOT A GOT A FOR THE FOR THE FOOTAGES IS RETAINED ITS JUST NOT. AS IMMEDIATELY ACCESSIBLE. IT IS IMMEDIATELY ACCESSIBLE BUT ONLY TO THOSE WHO- HAVE PERMISSION IN ORDER TO ACCESS AND THEIR ROLE IS- SET ACCORDINGLY- WHICH ONLY- AND ADMINISTRATOR WOULD HAVE FULL CONTROL OVER THAT- ACCESS WHICH IS VERY LIMITED. I'M SO PEOPLE THAT- AT VIEW VIDEO OR ARE INVOLVED IN AN INCIDENT- I WOULD HAVE ONLY READ ONLY ACCESS. AND JUST JUST ARM JUST AFTER THING QUESTION TO YOU IS DUE TO. THE OTHER GENTLEMAN ON HAVE THE BEEN SITUATIONS WHERE THE FOOTAGE HAD BEEN REQUESTED PASSED THAT NINETY DAY WINDOW. I'M I AM NOT I'M ON THE TECHNICAL SIDE AND NOT ON THE OPERATIONAL SIDE TO MY KNOWLEDGE- THAT HAS NOT. BEEN THE CASE- BUT I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT. OKAY ANYONE ELSE BESIDES MR SPEARMAN WHO CAN SPEAK. DEFINITIVELY TO THE. WE WILL WORK WITH OUR OPERATIONS FOLKS GET BACK WITH YOU BUT- A CORE PART OF YOUR QUESTION I THINK IS YES AFTER NINETY DAYS OF A TRIGGERING EVENT HASN'T OCCURRED OR- OF CLAIMS BEEN FILED THE FOOTAGE IS DELETED- BUT WE WILL GO BACK AND LOOK TO SEE IF AFTER THAT NINETY DAY PERIOD THERE WERE CASES WHERE- FOOTAGE WOULD HAVE ASSISTED WITH THE INVESTIGATION I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE A CORE OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GET CORRECT THAT THAT THAT IS BUT I GUESS I'M GOING TO ANSWER SOME OF THESE THE FOOTAGE DELETED OR NOT DELETED BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING WAS. FROM YOUR TERM TECHNICAL PERSON THAT THE FOOTAGE WAS- STORED SOMEWHERE ELSE. IF ENTRY OKAY SO THERE'S NO CLAIM FILED THAN THAT BECAUSE TO LIVE OAK. WHAT GOT IT SO I THINK I THINK IT'S VERY QUICK VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S BEEN A CLAIM. THAT DOES COME IN THE PAST AND THEN TO THE WINDOW. AGAIN IT BASED ON OUR- PREVIOUS LOOK AT THE DATA. FOR THE LAST YEAR. ONLY 3% OF. ISSUES CAME OUT WHERE IT WAS AFTER THE FACT AFTER THAT NINETY DAY STORAGE. SO WHAT HAPPENED IN THE 3% THIS IS A- I WOULD HAVE TO WORK WITH OUR LEGAL TEAM AND OPERATIONS TEAM TO GET SPECIFICS ON THAT. WHERE THOSE CASES THAT YOU LOOKED AT ALL BEFORE THIS NEW YEAR THIS INCLUDE CASES AFTER THE NEW YEAR SAYS THIS IS A POLICY THAT WENT INTO EFFECT. WITH THE NEW YEAR. I BELIEVE IS THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FISCAL YEAR. RIGHT FOR MAKING AN ASSUMPTION ON. THE PROCESS THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE HAVE AND I WILL BE INFORMED. AND SO WOULD BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF THE- IF PEOPLE ARE TAKING LONGER KNOWING THAT THEY HAVE MORE TIME ENOUGH TO ISSUE THOSE COMPLAINTS. THAT'S MY ONLY CONCERN THAT BEHAVIOR MIGHT BE CHANGING GIVEN THE NEW POLICY UNTIL NINETY DAYS MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE ADEQUATE AND I DON'T KNOW THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE. ADEQUATE DATA GIVEN THEN YOU'RE THEN YOU'RE PROCESS WE HAVE. WHICH IS NOT NECESSARILY YOUR FAULT YOU CAN'T YOU DON'T IN A PLAN THAT HAS A VERY ENOUGH TIME OUT THERE BUT I DO THINK WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF THAT FOR MAKING DECISIONS. THIS IS A THUNDERSTORM I'M SORRY LITTLE PLEASED HAD PLEASE PLEASE. I WAS JUST GONNA OF REITERATE SOMETHING THAT MR SPEARMAN POINTED OUT THAT IS WE HAVE BEEN DOING A LOT OF OFFENDER EDUCATION ON THIS NEW PROCESS TO MAKE THEM ALL VERY AWARE OF HOW WHAT THE CHANGES ARE HOW AND HOW THEY WILL IMPACT THEM SO WE THINK THAT- OFFENDER EDUCATION PLUS RELAPSE NEW PROCESS THE NINETY DAYS THE SUFFICIENT WHAT WE ARE HERE FROM MARCH IS JUST CONCERN ON EVEN AND TODAY WHAT WE HEAR CONSTANTLY AS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EXPENDITURES FOR THE DEPARTMENT THAT THIS MAY BE A MEANWHILE WHILE WE REALLY AFFECT THE DEPARTMENT FOR TRYING TO BE RESOURCEFUL THIS SEEMS TO BE A SITUATION WHERE YOU'RE BEING PENNY WISE POUND FOOLISH AND THAT- THIS IS A VERY CRITICAL VIDEO FOOTAGE I MYSELF HAD A CHANCE TO. ON WITNESS IT WHEN- I'VE OF WITNESSING BODY CAMERA FOOTAGE WHEN I WENT TO CORCORAN- AND THE FACT THAT I THINK IT'S THERE ON THE OFFICERS I THINK IT'S VERY- COMPELLING BECAUSE IT'S GOOD TO HAVE THAT VIDEO EVIDENCE RATHER THAN HAVING TO. HOW WHAT I WITNESSED RECOUNT DIFFERENCE WHICH- I THINK IT'S VERY CRITICAL INFORMATION TO. MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE IMPROPER TRANSPARENCY AND THAT- SINCE WE HAVE THE- HE VIDEO FOOTAGE ANYWAYS I THINK IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO ACTUALLY DELETE IT OR TO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO IT- FIFTY FORTY PAY FOR RECORDED AND STORED IT ON YOU KNOW IF OTHER CRIMES WERE COMMITTED AND FROM THE SPECIALLY LIKE YOU AND SAID THE 3% THE CASES THEY CAME AFTER THE VIDEO FOOTAGE HAS ALREADY BEEN- EITHER DELETED OR STORED AND I'M NOT I'M NOT REALLY CLEAR WHICH ONE. BUT IT SEEMS. IMPORTERS WE WILL BE PAID FOR THIS IT'S ALREADY A SUNK COST- THE DISCIPLINE TO BE ANY. A VERY GOOD REASON WHY THAT STORE THAT VIDEO INFORMATION ISN'T STORED. YOU KNOW AT LEAST ON A BOND ON A ON A LONGER BASIS. RATHER THAN- YOU KNOW GETTING RID OF IT SINCE WE'VE ALREADY PAID FOR IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE- ANY. ANY SIGNIFICANT COST SAVINGS ESPECIALLY WHEN I LOOK AT ALL YOUR OTHER PCPS WHICH ARE. TENS OF MILLIONS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS HERE. AND WE HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED TALKING ABOUT YOUR YOUR YOUR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BCPS. SO AGAIN JUST SOMETHING WE WOULD- JETER TAKE A HARD LOOK AT TO RECONSIDER AND- PERHAPS- BRING SOMETHING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WE WILL GIVE CONSIDERATION THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE ANYONE ELSE HAVE ANY MORE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS ON ISSUE ONE.

I WANT TO THANK THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY FOR ITS SUPPORT OF THE ICT PROGRAMME IN THE DEPARTMENT'S EFFORTS TO SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE THE TREATMENT OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS WITHIN OUR INSTITUTIONS. SINCE JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED I ISSUE NEEDS. FOR PERSONS AND HAVE PROVIDED TREATMENT TO NEARLY THIRTY THOUSAND PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS. IT WILL BE A CRISIS IS CAUSING SIGNIFICANT ADDICTION AND LOSS OF LIFE THROUGHOUT OUR COMMUNITY IT CONTRIBUTES TO HOMELESSNESS AND CO WORKER HEALTH AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DISORDERS AND IS KNOWN TO DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS. THE FIRST. I'M SORRY IN THE LINE OF HER AT THE ONE MORE TIME SINCE THE PROGRAM. WE'RE HAVING A HARD TIME MAYBE RETURN AFTER VIDEO WE ARE ABLE IT WILL HAVE BETTER INTERNET CONNECTION. LET'S TRY THAT. CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW YES THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE WE APPRECIATE IT WE KNOW THAT TECHNOLOGY IS AND ALWAYS OUR FRIEND CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN HEAR YOU CAN YOU START OVER FROM THE BEGINNING. SURE GOOD AFTERNOON LISA HINES ATTACKS AND THE PROJECT EXECUTIVE FOR THE INTEGRATED SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT PROGRAM I WANT TO THANK THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY FOR ITS SUPPORT OF THE ICT PROGRAM AND THE DEPARTMENT'S EFFORTS TO SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE THE TREATMENT OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS WITHIN OUR INSTITUTION SINCE JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED ICT AT ALL THIRTY FOUR PRISON AND HAVE PROVIDED TREATMENT TO NEARLY THIRTY THOUSAND PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS. THE OPIATE CRISIS IS CAUSING SIGNIFICANT ADDICTION AND LOSS OF LIFE THROUGHOUT OUR COMMUNITIES IT CONTRIBUTES TO HOMELESSNESS AND CO OCCURRING HEALTH AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DISORDERS AND IS KNOWN TO DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND 30% OF INCARCERATED POPULATIONS ARE KNOWN TO HAVE AN OPIATE USE DISORDER THE I. ACT PROGRAM CONTINUES TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS TOWARDS IDENTIFYING ASSESSING AND TREATING IT EASIER AS MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION. SUFFERING WITH AND SHOOTING. SINCE PER AND- I SHOULD BE TEASED STATEWIDE. I HAVE. SCREENED OVER SIXTY TWO THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS FOR SGD UTILIZING THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE QUICK'S GRANA MODIFY THIS IS A PROCESS NEARLY TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS FOR S. U. D. UTILIZING THE NIGHT A MODIFIED ASSIST IN THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE ARE A SAM SUITE OF TOOLS HAVE EVALUATED NEARLY TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS FOR MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT. I PROVIDE I DO NOT TO OVER TWENTY THREE THOUSAND PARTICIPANTS AND IT PROVIDED CVR AIRCARD HERO INTERVENTIONS. TO OVER FOURTEEN THOUSAND PARTICIPANTS. THIS PROPOSED ON FIND TO THE DEPARTMENT TO SERVE MORE INDIVIDUALS SUFFERING WITH THE S. T. MAKING AVAILABLE ALL PROGRAM ELEMENTS INCLUDING COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL INNER ENGINES. MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PROVIDE I DIDN'T ENHANCE FOR A RELEASE IN TRANSITION SERVICES CONTINUING THE PROVISION OF NALOXONE UPON RELEASE AND WORKING WITH OUR COUNTY AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO SUPPORT. CANADIAN LINKAGES TO SERVICES UPON RELEASE WHEN INDIVIDUALS SUFFERING WITH. CITY ARE MOST AT RISK OF OVERDOSE DEATHS. I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER NY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT THE PROPOSAL AND HAVE SEVERAL OF THE PROGRAM SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AS- WELL. THANK YOU. WE HAVE OUR NEXT SPEAKER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME'S OUR SENSES WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE FIND THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO EXPAND AND MODIFY THE INTEGRATED SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT PROGRAM OR ICTP HAS MERIT HOWEVER BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT WE HAVE THREE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WOULD MODIFY THE PROPOSAL. WE ARE FIRST RECOMMENDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE A REVISED PROPOSAL AT THE MAY REVISION. THAT IS ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THE UPDATED PROJECTIONS. BECAUSE THE OVERALL LEVEL OF FUNDING BEING REQUESTED FOR THE PROGRAM IS CLOSELY CONNECTED AT THE SIZE OF THE INMATE POPULATION. THE PROPOSAL WILL LIKELY NEED TO BE ADJUSTED FOR THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE INMATE POPULATION MAY BE LOWER THAN CURRENTLY PROJECTED AS DISCUSSED IN THE LAST HEARING. OUR SECOND RECOMMENDATION IS TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE CHOOSES TO APPROVE ADDITIONAL FUNDING. FOR THE PROGRAM WE RECOMMEND APPROVAL OF PROVISIONAL BUDGET LANGUAGE REQUIRING THAT ANY BUDGET FUNDS NOT SPENT ON THE PROGRAM. REVERT TO THE GENERAL FUND AND WE WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THERE ARE A COUPLE OF FACTORS THAT COULD LIMIT THAT DEPARTMENTS ABILITY TO EXPAND AS PROPOSED. THESE LIMITATIONS WOULD RESULT IN THE DEPARTMENT NOT USING THE FULL BUDGET AMOUNT LONGER THAN ANTICIPATED TO FILL THE REQUESTED THREE HUNDRED AND TEN POSITIONS. ALSO IT IS QUESTIONABLE WHETHER THE DEPARTMENT WILL HAVE SUFFICIENT SPACE TO ACCOMMODATE THE LEVEL NECESSARY FOR THE EXPANSION. GIVEN THAT LAST YEAR THE DEPARTMENT NOTED SUFFICIENT CLASSROOM SPACE AT THE PRISONS AS A CHALLENGE. THE LAST THING. WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF PROVIDE THE RESULTS OF THE EVALUATION THAT THEY ARE CONTRACTING WITH SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN DETERMINE. WHETHER THE PROGRAM IS EFFECTIVELY ACHIEVING ITS GOALS. OR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAM IS NOT YET CLEAR. INITIAL DATA SHOW THAT SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER RELATED DEATHS AND HOSPITALIZATIONS HAVE GONE DOWN SINCE THE PROGRAM BEGAN. THE DEPARTMENT INTENDS TO CONTRACT WITH THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA THAT WE- VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM. AND THINKING I'D BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. DO WE HAVE ON OUR SPEAKER. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR FRANKLY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE ADMINISTRATION KNOWS THAT THE CURRENT FLUCTUATIONS IN THE INCARCERATED POPULATION ARE ANTICIPATED TO IMPACT THE NEAR TERM EGGS ARE NOT ANTICIPATED TO IMPACT THE NEAR TERM EXPANSION OF PROTECTED IN THIS PROPOSAL A REVIEW OF MEDICATED THAT MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT PARTICIPANTS FIGURES INDICATES THAT THE PROGRAM REMAINS ON TARGET TO REACH APPROXIMATELY EIGHTEEN THOUSAND. MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT PARTICIPANTS BY THE END OF JUNE TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND ROUGHLY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY TWENTY THREE THE ADMINISTRATION RECOGNIZES SERVICE- THE POTENTIAL FOR INCREMENTAL CHANGES IN THE PROGRAM PARTICIPANT POPULATION FROM YEAR TO YEAR ACCORDINGLY THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL- ASSUMES THAT THE SPECIFIC LEVEL POPULATION DRIVEN RESOURCES FOR THE INTEGRATED SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT PROGRAM WILL BE ADJUSTED EACH YEAR STARTING. IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY. TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AS PART OF THE ANNUAL CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION POPULATION JUST PROCESS WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE BUT THAT THE POPULATION DRIVEN METHODOLOGY PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. LIKELY MITIGATES THE NEED FOR BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE A SUGGESTED BY THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- THE ADMINISTRATION NOTES THAT THIS IS INVESTMENT TO EXPAND THE- INTEGRATED SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT PROGRAM. WILL PROVIDE A BETTER HEALTH- IN PROVIDE FOR BETTER CRIMINAL JUSTICE OUTCOMES AND REDUCE THE NEGATIVE SOCIAL IMPACTS ASSOCIATED WITH SUBSTANCE USE pCOLLEAGUES HAVE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS ON THIS ITEM. MANILA MISTER TANGO. JUST MISTER CARTER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH THE- THE POPULATION BASED METHODOLOGY PROPOSAL. CERTAINLY THE I'M COMING NEED SOME HELP WITH- BEFORE WITH MY COLLEAGUES AT A COMPANY CORRECTIONAL HEALTHCARE SERVICES BUT FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR IT'S ANTICIPATED TO INCREASE- EACH MONTH BY APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED AND- EIGHTY OF PER MONTH AND THEN THE SUBSEQUENT OF FISCAL STARTING IN JUNE TWENTY TWENTY TWO IT'S GOING TO IT THE POPULATION WILL INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY SIX HUNDRED FORTY. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE POPULATION DECREASES. LET'S SAY WHAT HAPPENS I'M GOING TO BE OPTIMISTIC WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE POPULATION DECREASES WHICH IS WHAT'S BEEN PROJECTED. DO YOU WANT TO DO YOU WANT TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER. HI THIS IS ALLISON HULETT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ULTIMATELY WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS THAT WE WOULD ADJUST THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES FOR THE PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN SPECIFIC ELEMENTS FOR EXAMPLE THE PHARMACEUTICALS AND THAT BOB CAN CAN IF BOB THAT NOT PROGRAMMER THE MEDICALLY ASSISTED TREATMENT PROGRAM CONSISTS OF THAT WE WOULD ACTUALLY ADJUST THOSE FROM YEAR TO YEAR BASED ON THE POPULATION AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THOSE INCREASE OR DECREASE WE WOULD ANTICIPATE THAT OUR- ADJUSTMENT METHODOLOGY WOULD REFLECT THAT. WE HAVE NOT- DETERMINE WHAT THE PRECISE METHODOLOGY WE BELIEVE I THAT'S FAIRLY CONSISTENT- WENT WITH THAT THE WAY THAT WE TREAT POPULATION DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES BUT WE ANTICIPATE WE WOULD BE ABLE TO BRING INFORMATION FORWARD IN THE NEXT GOVERNOR'S BUDGET GIVEN AT. THE CONSISTENCY WITH THE POPULATION ADJUSTMENT PROCESS FOR CDC ARE OKAY SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT WE CAN. HOLD IT UP UNTIL NEXT JANUARY. I KNOW I. WE WOULD IN JUST TO KIND OF REAL BASED ON THE DATA THAT WAS THERE THE ADMINISTRATION'S FAIRLY CONFIDENT THAT WE'RE GOING TO ACHIEVE THEIR VALUES ADDS THAT THE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND THAT'S A THEIR BASED ON CURRENT PROJECTIONS AND THAT'S KIND OF YOUR RESPECTIVE OF THE DROP IN POPULATION NOT- IT MAY BE THEME AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ON TARGET BASED ON CURRENT TRENDS COULD BE RESPECTED OF THE POPULATION COULD YOU ANSWER THE QUESTION I HAVE MISTER COATING WALKING THROUGH METHODOLOGY PLEASE. BUT WE DON'T HAVE A METHODOLOGY YOU ARE PREPARED YET WE WOULD ANTICIPATE THAT THAT WOULD COME FORWARD AS A PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. WE WHERE WE'RE PUTTING. A REVISION OF THE JANUARY BUDGET. IN THE IN THE JANUARY BUDGET BECAUSE WE WOULDN'T BE ADJUSTING THAT'S WHAT ARE YOU ASKING THE- FOR THIS JUNE. I'LL BE FINE FUNDING BASED ON THE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND. INCARCERATED INDIVIDUAL ESTIMATES WERE WORKING FROM. AND IF THE POPULATION GOES DOWN WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW YOU WOULD ADJUST THE BASELINE FUNDING AS OF TODAY. I MEAN GENERALLY SPEAKING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TAKING KIND OF THOSE THINGS THAT ARE DRIVEN BY THE POPULATION LIKE THE PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS FOR EXAMPLE AND WE WOULD ASSUME THAT WE WOULD ADJUST THAT BASED ON SOME TYPE OF- ADJUSTMENT THAT REFLECTS BOTH THE COST OF THOSE PRODUCTS AND THAT. NUMBER OF INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS THAT CITY STARTS PROTECTING TO SERVE THAT'S FAIRLY CONSISTENT WITH THE OVERALL CITY FAIR PROCESS I'M AND WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WE JUST HAVEN'T DETERMINE THE PRECISE METHODOLOGY YEAH. I'M NOT THAT WOULD BE FINE UNLESS YOU WANT TO DO WOULD YOU LIKE A GENERAL NUMBER OR PRECISE NUMBER IN THE BUDGET NEXT THIS YEAR. IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME. SORRY AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER TEAM WORKS. ABOUT JUST IN THE- FOR TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AND FORWARD. WE'RE STILL ANTICIPATING TED HIT AS AS MY COLLEAGUE DESCRIBED PURSUANT TO SUBPOENA HIT THAT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND BY JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AND IF MADE. BY BY THE END OF JUNE OF. THIS YEAR AT THE DEPARTMENT CONTRACT TO HAVE APPROXIMATELY SEVENTEEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN PARTICIPANTS- BY THE END OF THIS FISCAL YEAR AND THE REAL. BILL UNTIL TO PAY AN ADDITIONAL SIX HUNDRED FORTY FIVE I'M A PATIENT PATIENTS PER MONTH TO BE ADDED. I SEE THE LEADING UP TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND. AND THEN HOW MANY POSITIONS DO YOU NEED FOR PER PERSON PER FOR. I WERE HAPPY TO WORK WITH ADD THAT I'M TEACHER AND PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO YOU I IT'S NOT THE STOPPING THAT'S GOING TO BE ADJUSTED. AND THIS GOES BACK TO KIND OF IN THE DISCUSSIONS BOB OF WHAT THAT ACTUAL METHODOLOGY MIGHT CONSIST OF WHICH IS STILL NOT BEEN DETERMINED BUT STAFFING WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE ONE OF THOSE ELEMENTS WE'RE TALKING LARGELY ABOUT THE PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS AND SOME OTHER SPECIFIC THINGS THAT ARE DRIVEN BY THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS THAT YOU'RE SERVING. BUT I GUESS HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH THIS HUNDRED AT THIS VERY SPECIFIC HUNDRED TWENTY SIX MILLION NUMBER. IN THE THREE HUNDRED AND TEN POSITION NUMBER. MY LIFE BY ON THE WRONG ITEM. YEAH I ACTUALLY DIFFERENT OF MY COLLEAGUES I'M FROM CITY START TO HELP US ROUTE ME TO A LITTLE BIT AND THEN WE CAN HOP BACK IN WHERE NEEDED. AND REMEMBER THIS IS LEAVE BEHIND. IF I MAY I'D LIKE TO DEFERRED CUTE DR DUNLOP AND PRIDES METHODOLOGY TO THAT PERFECT THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M LOOKING INTO YOUR HEART SACRAMENTO COMMUNICATE. WE GO HERE YOU GO AHEAD OKAY GREAT- SO THERE'S DIFFERENT COMPONENTS THAT REALLY- WENT INTO- IDENTIFYING THE APPROXIMATE THREE HUNDRED STAFF SO- THERE ARE NURSING POSITIONS THAT WINS ARE BASED OFF OF THE MEDICATION MINISTRATIONS THEY WERE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER POSITIONS THAT WENT TO. HOW MANY OF THE PATIENTS COULD BE SEEN- BY A SPECIFIC NUMBER PROVIDERS BECAUSE THERE ARE THE CIVIC LIMITATIONS TO THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT NAY ANYONE POSITION CAN SEE WHO ARE ON MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT. HOLDEN ARE THERE'S QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ABOUT SPECIFICS YEAH I DO THANK YOU FOR ASKING. I'M GLAD SOMEONE CAN ANSWER MY QUESTION YEAH HOW MANY POSITIONS FROM. POSITIONS PER PATIENT ARE YOU ESTIMATING ROUGHLY NEEDING. SO WHAT WHAT WHAT POSITION TYPE. YOU COULD WALK THROUGH ALL OF THEM H I CAN DO WE CAN TO DO TO GO THROUGH ALL FOR UNDER TEN IF YOU'D LIKE. I HAVE NOTHING I MUST READ MY SCHEDULE'S BEEN CLEAR TO THE. SO I THINK IT WOULD PROBABLY BE A BETTER USE OF TIME TO PROVIDE SOMETHING IN WRITING TO YOU- NO READING ON RIGHT HERE ON MILLER DO YOU WHAT DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING- DID YOU COME TO THIS HEARING PREPARED TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. I'M JUST ASKING BECAUSE YOU'RE PRETTY YOU'RE ASKING FOR A HUNDRED TWENTY SIX MILLION. FOR THREE HUNDRED TEN POSITIONS I'M ASKING YOU FOR MORE DETAILED BREAKDOWN OF THE THREE- TEMPTATIONS WHICH IS WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR. AND YOU DON'T SEEM TO BE ABLE TO GIVE US ANY MORE DETAIL. AND NO ONE ON THIS NO ONE ON THE ASSEMBLY. BUT IF I COULD FINISH ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOU'RE A HUNDRED TWENTY SIX MILLION YOU HAVEN'T THIRD THERE. THE THING TO BE ANY JUSTIFICATION OR METHODOLOGY THAT YOU CAN PERFORMED AS TO HOW YOU GOT THIS RANDOM POSITIONS. I THINK WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU THAT METHODOLOGY IN WRITING. WHAT AND WHY IS THIS NOT WHERE YOU'RE NOT READY TO DO IT. IN IN A PUBLIC HEARING. TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS WITH THIS IS WHEN THE TIME IS HERE FOR WHEN. I IT WOULD BE A VERY LONG AND EXHAUSTIVE PROCESS BUT IF YOU GIVE ME A MOMENT I WILL PULL UP- DOCUMENTS SEVENTY CAN GO THROUGH. AFTER THAT WOULD BE GREAT WE COULD WE COULD JUST START I THINK WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THEM BUT I THINK IF YOU COULD WALK THROUGH SOME OF THEM JUST TO GIVE US A SENSE OF. WHAT YOU'RE THINKING WHAT WE'D REALLY APPRECIATE IT. GIVE ME ONE MOMENT PERFECT. IT MAY BE ARE BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING THAT MAYBE MISS HINES CAN TALK ABOUT THE- EFFICACY OF THE PROGRAM AND JUST FRONT OF THAT ANSWERS ARE GOING TO I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE DO HAVE- YOU KNOW SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT I THINK IT IS EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT. IF YOU COULD JUST WALK THROUGH THE OF ANY METRICS YOU COULD TALK ABOUT ABOUT THE EFFICACY OF THE PROGRAM. SURE ACTUALLY I'M FOR THAT I'LL DEFER TO YOU AND DOCTOR KEENAN. AT RENE KANE AND WHAT IS PREPARED TO TALK ABOUT THAT INTEREST YOU CAN DEPART ANY SELLING. THE POSITIONS AND THAT DOCTOR THEM UP THE CONNECT EACH OF OUR BATCH OF PETITIONS THERE FOR THAT WERE IN FACT A TO RATIO. AND EACH OF THOSE RACES WERE TOUGH- TIED TO ACTUAL NUMBERS THAT WE ARE SR. I MEAN. ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND OR AND- THOSE THAT ARE PROJECTED TO BE SERVICE TO THE POSITIONS I THINK TO GET TO THE ROOT OF YOUR QUESTION IF WE TIE THIS TO POPULATION WITH. THE RATHER POSITIONS ALSO BE. AT TIED TO POPULATION AGAIN. RIGHT BUT IT'S PARTNERS HAVE NOT AND COME UP WITH THAT THOROUGH METHODOLOGY BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING. THAT BECAUSE ONLY THOSE RESOURCES TIED TO RATIOS MAY BE NEEDED FOR EACH. BATCH OF. POPULATION WHETHER THAT'S OUR NURSING POPULATION. ARE AOD COUNSELORS THAT PROVIDE SERVICES. AND REHABILITATION PROGRAMS AND OUR OUR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. I HOPE THAT'S A LITTLE HELPFUL BUT WE. WILL GET YOU WHATEVER YOU NEED IN WRITING. DR CANNON. YES GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE I'M A LITTLE SCARED TO PUT MY VIDEO ON BUT I CAN TRY- IF IT DOESN'T WORK WE'LL JUST DO OF THE AUDIO I'M ON A CANE I'M DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR MEDICAL SERVICES. AND- JUST A REMINDER AS YOU AS YOU KNOW THIS PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED AS A AS A HEALTH CARE PROGRAM- WITH PARTNERS ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION. I AND IT WAS A CREATED THAT WAY BECAUSE WE KNOWLEDGE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER IS A CHRONIC DISEASE- WE HAVE A LOT OF PATIECE IN OUR SYSTEM WHO NEED TREATMENT UNFORTUNATELY TREATMENT IS VERY EFFECTIVE. I IN THE TWO YEARS SINCE WE'VE IMPLEMENTED THIS PROGRAM- WHICH IS FAIRLY EARLY ON- WE HAVE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN OVERDOSE DEATHS AGAIN THAT WAS A PRIMARY OUTCOME- THAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR SINCE THIS IS A PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH CARE. RELATED ENDEAVOR. AND SO ABOUT COMPARED TO- BEFORE THIS PROGRAM WAS IMPLEMENTED- WE ARE CONTINUING TO SEE. OF THE REDUCTIONS IN OVERDOSE DEATHS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE- ALTHOUGH THAT'S PRELIMINARY DATA. DESPITE SOME OF OUR OPERATIONS OPENING BACK UP WE CONTINUE TO SEE OVERDOSE DEATHS. SIGNIFICANTLY DOWN. WE ALSO HAVE SEEN OVERDOSE BELIEVE WE HAD SOME NUMBERS IN THE B. C. D. AND LISA HINES OUTLINED THEM BUT- ABOUT 227% IT'S PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT MORE NOW ABOUT A THIRD. REDUCTION IN HOSPITALIZATIONS RELATED TO OVERDOSE. WE ARE ALSO SEEN- A LOT OF OTHER- SORT OF EARLY POSITIVE OUTCOMES ARE RELATED TO THIS PROGRAM. AND BESIDE THE REDUCTIONS IN OVERDOSE DEATHS AND HOSPITALIZATIONS UP IN THE FIRST TIME IN MY CAREER. I AM RECEIVING LETTERS OF GRATITUDE FROM PATIENTS AS OPPOSED TO LETTERS OF GRIEVANCES ON I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT OUTCOME WE ALSO ACTUALLY HAVE LETTERS FROM OUR CLINICIANS AS WELL WHO FIND THIS- WORK VERY REWARDING. IT'S TOO EARLY TO DO SOME OUTCOMES TO LOOK AT OUTCOMES OF POST RELEASE BUT BUT THAT IS ALSO ARE PLANNED TO LOOK AT THOSE OUTCOMES AS WELL. THANK YOU I THINK THAT'S GREAT I THINK THAT THE PROGRAM'S DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE APPLAUDED FOR THAT SIXTY FOUR PERCENT. THE CLIENT AS WELL AS THE 27% DECLINE FOR THE OVERDOSE RELATED DEATH CAN YOU JUST WALK. WALK ME THROUGH THE NUMBERS JUST JUST TO GIVE ME GIVE ME A SENSE OF WHAT. IT WAS HARD WITH A PERCENTAGE IS KIND OF ARE WE TALKING. WHAT WHAT THE NUMBERS ARE AND ALSO THE HOSPITALIZATION NUMBERS. SURE SO WHAT I WAS REFERRING TO IN TERMS OF THE OVERDOSE DEATHS WE WERE COMPARING- RATES- PRIOR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM SO TWENTY NINETEEN. COMPARED TO TWENTY TWENTY. AND SO- I BELIEVE DOCTOR DOWN THE HAVE- HIS STAFF- COLLECT THEM YOU DON'T REPORT ON THIS INFORMATION BUT IT WAS IN THE MID SIXTIES- THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS WHO WHO DIED. FROM OVERDOSE IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND WE WENT DOWN TO ABOUT- IN THE LOW TWENTIES GROUP. AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO SEE THAT PATTERN AGAIN LISA HINES STRESSED- IN HER OPENING STATEMENT THAT OVERDOSE DEATHS FROM OPIOIDS CONTINUE TO RISE. AT AN ASTONISHING RATE IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN CALIFORNIA SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE DEPARTMENT OF IS TRULY SIGNIFICANT PARTICULARLY IN THAT CONTEXT. IN TERMS OF POSSIBLE. COULD COULD FILL BOTH SIDES CONTINUE THAT WHEN I WAS COMPOSED THANK YOU. NOW IN TERMS OF HOSPITAL. I CAN GET YOU THE- YOU KNOW THE EXACT NUMBERS I BELIEVE WE HAVE THEM IN THE IN THE B. C. P. BUT AGAIN IT'S ABOUT I THINK WE SAID A 27% REDUCTION- AND WE ARE CONTINUING TO SEE YOU KNOW THOSE DECLINES. CREEK. COULD COULD WE GO BACK TO THE THREE OTHER TEMPTATIONS EVERYBODY TO HAVE A LITTLE- MY BACKGROUND ON THAT INFORMATION. SURE I AM READY WONDERFUL. OKAY SO WE ARE ASKING FOR A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT POSITIONS THAT SERVE DIFFICULT SO WE HAVE ON MEDICAL SERVICES THAT ARE SAYING SERVICES POSITIONS THERE ARE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS FOR QUALITY MANAGEMENT FOR PERFORMANCE EVALUATION PURPOSE OUR PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT UNIT- OUR OUR I. T. SERVICES HR AD THE OUR DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATIVE SERVICES PROGRAMS AND COMMUNICATIONS. ARE THERE SPECIFIC THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO TOUCH UPON. YES I'M INTERESTED IN WHAT PERCENT OF THE THREE HUNDRED TEMPERATE JUST GIVEN WHAT YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT- ACTUALLY SERVING DIRECT FLIGHTS CURIOUS WHY YOU NEED A COMMUNICATIONS PERSON TO TALK. ABOUT OKAY SO THOSE THAT ARE WORKING DIRECTLY WITH PATIENS- LOOKS LIKE FOR THE FIRST YEAR WERE ASKING FOR FOURTEEN ADDITION CERTAIN POSITIONS- THAT ARE GOING TO BE UP THE INSTITUTIONS AN ADDITIONAL FIVE POSITIONS. THAT WILL BE WORKING LOCATED ACT MOST LIKELY HEADQUARTERS FOR IT BETTER ADDICTION SPECIALISTS. WE HAVE A CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKERS- BAD LARRY ONLINE TO THIRTY SIX POSITIONS SEVEN TENTHS TREATIES ARE ABOUT WILL BE ONE KERR INSTITUTE JANET WITH- LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE BIT OF ADDITIONAL- JUDICIAL POSITIONS THERE. THAT CAME UP AND POSTULATING DOCTOR CAN I SPEAK TO THIS COULD BE EITHER DEDICATED TO ARE HEAVIER- SERVER OPERATED ICTP OUR POPULATIONS OF THE INSTITUTIONS WERE COULD BE- OF GRATITUDE HEADQUARTERS FOR TELESERVICES TELESERVICES. WE'RE LOOKING AT- SOME PSYCHIATRY SOCIAL WORKER A SUPERVISORS WERE LOOKING AT- EIGHTEEN PHARMACIES PHARMACISTS ONE POSITIONS. ARM AT THIRTY FARM TECHNICIANS. LABORATORY ASSISTANCE CERTAIN POSITIONS AB ONE SINGER CLINICAL LAB TECHNOLOGIST. FOUR A DIFFICULT SET THESE THESE POSITIONS ARE NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED WITH PATIENT CARE BUT ARE THEY PROVIDE SUPPORT WHICH IS- FOR HEPA POSITIONS AND ONE STAFF SERVICE MANAGER POSITION. SO THAT'S JUST THE FIRST YEAR. FIFTY JUST TO GIVE ME A SENSE FOR ONE. PATIENT HOW MANY POSITIONS ARE WE. ALLOCATED OR I'M SORRY OR PER PER POSITION HOW MANY. PATIENTS ARE WE SERVING I GUESS MAYBE THAT'S THE BETTER ANSWER CUSTOMER QUESTIONS ZERO FOUR FOR A PHYSICIAN IT IS LIMITED BY WHAT'S CALLED A TAX WAIVER AND- I BELIEVE OUR POSITION POPULATION ARE WE ARE EXPERTS. OUR ONE HUNDRED PATIENTS- PRIMARILY THOUGH DR KEENAN HAS WE MADE EFFORTS TO EXPAND. THAT TO THE MAXIMUM. ALL RIGHT NOW- THAT'S JUST OUR ADDICTION MEDICINE CENTRAL TEAM- BUT I'M I'M WONDERING ASSEMBLY MEMBER I GUESS THAT'S ANOTHER WAY TO LOOK AT THIS I THINK YOUR QUESTION OF WHAT'S THE BREAKDOWN IN TERMS OF DIRECT PATIENT CARE- THE VAST MAJORITY OF POSITIONS WE ARE ASKING FOR OUR CLINICAL POSITIONS THAT TOUCH THE PATIENT. AS DR DUNLAP WAS SAYING SO FOR THE MEDICAL FOLKS WHICH INCLUDES YOU KNOW PHYSICIANS SPECIAL WORKERS PHARMACISTS FARM TAX LABORATORY ASSISTANCE- IT IT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT POSITIONS FOR THAT FIRST YEAR AND THEN NURSES WHO DO SOME OF THE INITIAL SCREENING AS WELL AS- I ADMINISTER THE MEDICATION IT'S A HUNDRED AND TWELVE FOR THAT. FIRST YEAR AND SO THAT REALLY IS THE MAJORITY OF POSITIONS ARE WHAT I CONSIDER DIRECT CLINICAL PATIENT CARE POSITIONS. I GUESS I GUESS MAYBE THE BARE MAJORITY I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE OTHER 50% OF POSITIONS ARE GOING TOWARD. IT'S MORE ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE POSITIONS A HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT PLUS A HUNDRED AND TWELVE. FORTY THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT PLUS HUNDRED AND TWELFTH FROM ELEVEN FORTY I'M SORRY YEAH. THIRD PARTY. BURKE BUT THEY WERE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT I MEAN I'M I'M NOT ACCORDING TO THE CRITICAL PART OBVIOUSLY- WELL BUT OF FURNITURE MEDICAL JUDGMENT ABOUT THAT I TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE OTHER THE SEVENTY POSITIONS OBVIOUSLY WHAT WE DO I TOTALLY AGREE THAT HEALTH PROFESSIONALS NEED SUPPORT JUST TRYING TO HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE- AND THEN I GUESS ALSO. ARMED WHAT WE'RE HOPING THE POLICY EVEN AS WE AS WE KNOW THE POPULATION WILL GO DOWN YOU'RE STILL PROJECTING THE INCREASE IN DEMAND TO UP TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND. SO OUR BEST ESTIMATES- OKAY HE SAID HE WANTED TO. NO SO OUR OUR OUR PROJECTIONS UP THROUGH- DECEMBER WERE SPOT ON IN TERMS OF THE GROWTH RATE AND THEN ON THE ON THE CRIME- SEARCH IT THE PRISON SYSTEM AND SO WE FELT A LITTLE BIT LOWER TARGET BUT NOW THAT A MICRON SEARCH IS A PROCEEDING WE BELIEVE THAT WILL BE BACK ON TRACK TO HIT OUR TARGET FOR THE END OF THIS FISCAL YEAR OF THAT SEVENTEEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIX THE ONE IS THAT WHAT IT WAS RIGHT YOU CAN'T ALL THAT YOU SPECIFICALLY YEAH. OKAY- REMEMBER I AM ALSO AN- OUR POPULATION PROJECTIONS WE KNOW THE BETWEEN TWO FIVE AND PERCENT ACROSS COPY ARE TO HAVE AN OPIATE JUST AND NOT THE ENTIRE IT WOULD HAVE EITHER SEXY SHE'S JUST WE ARE SCREENING IT'S OR SO PRETTY PRETTY QUICKLY SOMETIMES AND IN FACT PRETTY CLEAR THAT WE ARE NOT AT THE STANDARD IF YOU WILL. THAT WE SEE NATIONALLY AND AS DR KEENAN MENTIONED WITH THE INK. AND THE PREVIOUS DISORDER AND THEY INCREASING DEATHS EVERYWHERE. I DON'T PERSONAL AN- OCCASIONS OTHER THAN CALIFORNIA AND- THE OTHER AT POINT THAT YOU BRING WITH REGARD TO ANY OF THE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS THERE ARE. RECTIFICATIONS ADDITION IN THERE AND I. LIKE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN THAT DURING REGULAR COMMUNICATIONS TEAM DEVELOPED AN WHAT'S CALLED THE IRISH DETIK INSIDER. IMAGE POPULATION THEY PROVIDE OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND. COPIES OF THAT THAT INCLUDES JOURNALING SOME SELF HELP INFORMATION THEY HAVE I THINK THE YEAR SO FEBRUARY IS HEART HEALTH. IT'S BEEN. ALL OF US ARE DIRECTOR DIRECTOR HEINZ YOUR YOUR ONLINE VIDEO TURNED OFF AND WE CAN'T HEAR YOU ANYMORE AND IF YOU CAN HEAR US. YOU'VE GOT CUT OFF RIGHT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT HEART HEALTH MONTH. PROVIDES. YOU BROKE THE SYSTEM. KERN. I THANK GOD FOR THE OTHER PERSON OTHER THE OTHER MEMBERS OF YOUR PARTY FOR ALL CONTINUE TO BE ON HERE OH DEAR THE OTHER QUESTION I WOULD HAVE IS HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS IN CONNECTION TO REDUCING THE INFLOW OF NARCOTICS INTO THE PRISON SYSTEM ABOUT OBVIOUSLY THE NINE THAT WE CONTINUE TO HEAR ABOUT. IN OUR- SUB HEARING THAT EVEN DURING COLD WIND. THERE WERE NO VISITORS- WE STILL SAW A FIFTY AN UPTICK IN NARCOTICS ENTERING INTO. OUR SYSTEMS AND JUST KIND OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF THERE IS ANY. SORT OF PARTNERSHIP THERE. I DON'T KNOW THIS IS THE PROGRAM THAT DEALS WITH SO THAT PARTIES I WILL DEFER ON THAT PIECE AND I'M SURE- I MEAN I WOULD JUST SAY IN GENERAL THOUGH THE QUESTIONS THAT MR TANG IS. ASKING AS TO TWO FOLD ONE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE METHODOLOGY OF HOW WE GOT TO TWO THREE HUNDRED AND TEN IT'S A SIZEABLE NUMBER WITH THE FESTIVAL- INVESTMENT BUT TO IN THE PAST WE'VE DONE THESE INVESTMENTS AND- WE HAVE. FUNDED OVER FOUR HUNDRED POSITIONS WE HAVE A LOT OF VACANCIES IN THE FIFTH AND IN THAT IN THAT SPACE AS WELL WE HAVE CLOSE TO TWO HUNDRED VACANCIES THERE. AND SO- I THINK THERE'S ALSO CONCERNS THAT WE ARE. ALLOCATING FUNDS WILL MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FILL IN THE VACANCIES OR US COAL THAT HAS. FORCED US TO. A STAR PROGRAM STOP PROGRAM START IN THE MIDDLE THIRD JUST CONTINUE HOW MIGHT THAT AFFECT YOU KNOW- THE SERVICES DOWN DOWN THE ROAD OR WHETHER OR NOT WE NEED TO FIND THAT THIS LEVEL- NOW OR IF OR IF. THERE'S A SMALLER NUMBER TO BEGIN WITH AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT SB VISITED AND IN THE FUTURE BUDGET. AND SO I THINK THE FOURTH OF THE CONCERNS THAT ARE YOU ARE IN PART HEARING. HI I HAVE TO DO HAVE TO DEAL WITH WITH THAT PIECE. THERE IS A TO STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT- NOT ONLY IN WRITING BUT AS YOU COME BACK TO US IF YOU HAVE. ADDITIONAL ANSWERS ABOUT THE METHODOLOGY. I AM ABOUT THE ABILITY OF HOW REALISTIC IT IS TO ACTUALLY FILL UP OF ALL THOSE POSITIONS BY. TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THANK YOU MA'AM TRACKING THAT SUMMARIZES- OUR POINTS THANKS FOR THE TIP. NO PROBLEM I WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S ENOUGH MONEY FOR ALL OF MY OTHER EACH A ISSUES TO. SAY I EXPECT YOUR I APPRECIATE YOUR PRUDENT HERE- IF NONE OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ON THE SITE AND WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND CLOSE UP ISSUE NUMBER TWO. THANK YOU TO THE PANELISTS AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE. WHICH IS OUR BACHELOR'S DEGREE PROGRAM. AND WE HAVE- I THINK I HAVE FOUR PANEL LISTENING BECAUSE IT'S JUST GOING ORDER- WITHOUT WAITING FOR A PROMPT. GOOD AFTERNOON I AM SHANNON PLAINTIFF TRANSCENDENT OF THE OPETH THE CORRECTIONAL EDUCATION FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. AND I'M HERE TO SHARE THAT THERE IS A REHABILITATIVE REVOLUTION UNDER WAY IN CALIFORNIA PRESIDENT. IN THE PAST SEVEN YEARS BECAUSE OF THE SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATURE AND SPENT A PASSAGE OF SENATE BILL THIRTEEN NINETY ONE WHICH ALLOWED CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACULTY TO TEACH CLASSES INSIDE CDCR INSTITUTIONS. HIGHER EDUCATION HAS GROWN ENORMOUSLY. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY LOS ANGELES BECAME THE FIRST CSU OFFSPRING TO BE A PATHWAY INSIDE CDCR. SPENT TEN AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE PILOTED BACHELOR DEGREE PATHWAYS AND FOR ADDITIONAL INSTITUTION. AS PART AT CDC OUR GOAL TO COMPLETELY ALERT A RATTY KATE ILLITERACY. WE NOW HAVE OVER FIFTY THOUSAND INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS WITH CONFIRMED HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA. WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES THRIVING IN EVERY PRISON CURRENTLY FOURTEEN THOUSAND COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE EARNING TRANSFERABLE EIGHT. THERE IS A TIDAL WAVE OF DEMANDS FOR A BACHELOR OF ARTS OPPORTUNITY. IN FACT SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE EIGHT DEGREES EARNED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE DURING CO THAT. DEFAULT ONLY INCREASE AS WE EMERGE FROM THE- DARK CODE THAT DEFINES. CORRECTIONAL EDUCATION IS TRANSFORMATIVE THE OFFICE OF CORRECTIONAL EDUCATION SEEKS TO EXPAND THE EMBANKMENT CALIFORNIA'S MAKING THROUGH ITS WORLD CLASS HIGHER EDUCATION. TO INCARCERATED CALIFORNIANS BY FUNDING BFA. DEGREE PROGRAMS IN SEVEN CITIES INSTITUTIONS WE ARE REQUESTING FIVE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND DECREASING TO FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION ANNUALLY BEGINNING IN TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE AND FIFTEEN POSITION TO MAINTAIN AND EXPAND THE NUMBER OF PRESIDENT OFFERING BACHELOR'S DEGREE PROGRAM IN PARTNERSHIP WITH SEVERAL DIFFERENT CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES. EIGHT SEVEN HOT IN ADDITION OFFERING A BA DEGREE. ELIGIBLE STUDENTS WHO HAVE EARNED A FULLY TRANSFERABLE ASSOCIATE OF ARTS DEGREE IN ONE OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAM WOULD BE ABLE TO APPLY TO ONE OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY THAT IS PARTNERING WITH CDC ARE. COMPLETE THE FINAL TWO YEARS OF UPPER DIVISION COURSES SO WHAT YOU MIGHT THINK OF AS THEIR JUNIOR AND SENIOR YEARS. AS YOU KNOW CDC HAS EXPONENTIALLY INCREASED IT HIGH SCHOOL ACHIEVEMENT AND OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITIES. THE NOTION OF A SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE ON ITS HEAD. WE HAVE CREATED A PRISON TO COLLEGE PIPELINE INSTEAD AND WITH SUPPORT SERVICES LIKE THOSE OFFERED TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS AND THE RIGHT COLORS THAT WORK AND BUYERS YES YOUR PARTNER YOUR PROJECT REBOUND. DIDN'T EXPERIENCE A TRUE EDUCATION CONTINUING WHERE THEY RECEIVE A WARM HAND OFF TO COLLEGE AS THEY RELEASED FROM PRISON. WE NEED STUDENTS WHERE THEY ARE WHEN THEY ENTER THE CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM AFFECT THEIR SKILL ABILITIES. AND DESIRES AND THEN ASSISTANT TO COMPLETE THEIR GOAL THE THAT IF YOUR APPLICATION IN A CORRECT TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAM OR COLLEGE DEGREE. THE MULTI GENERATIONAL IMPACT ON THE STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES CANNOT BE OVERSTATED THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SHARE MY ENTHUSIASM FOR HIGHER EDUCATION AND PRETEND. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME'S ORLANDO SANCHEZ WITH THE L. A. L. WE DO NOT HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME WE THINK THAT THE PROPOSAL. AT THE PROPOSED BACHELOR DEGREE EXPANSION PROGRAM IS PROMISING GIVEN THAT RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT HIGHER EDUCATION HAS POSITIVE OUTCOMES FOR INCARCERATED PEOPLE. HOWEVER DURING OUR ORIGINAL ANALYSIS IT WASN'T CLEAR TO US AS TO WHY THE FOR REQUESTED AMOUNT WAS NECESSARY GIVEN THAT THE BA PROGRAMS WERE ESTABLISHED AND OPERATED WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT'S EXISTING BUDGET. AND SOME OF THOSE CAN BE FOUND WITHIN THE AGENDA BUT SINCE THEN THE DEPARTMENT HAS PROVIDED FURTHER INFORMATION ON WHY IT CANNOT CONTINUE TO OPERATE THE- PROGRAMS WITHIN THEIR EXISTING BUDGETS. ONE REASON IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAD ESTABLISHED NO COST CONTRACTS WITH THE PARTNER UNIVERSITIES ON A LIMITED TERM BASIS. AS OPPOSED TO A PERMANENT BASIS THE SECOND IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT INDICATED THAT IT HAD USED TO SAVINGS FROM BACON ACADEMIC INSTRUCTOR POSITIONS. OUR THE RESULT OF STAFFING SHORTAGES AND RECRUITMENT CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PANDEMIC. BERMAN NOTED THAT IT INTENDS TO FILL THESE TEACHER POSITIONS AND THEREFORE THE FUNDS WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE ON A PERMANENT BASIS. GIVEN THE QUESTIONS WE RAISED HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENTLY ANSWERED. WE DO NOT RAISE FURTHER CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU TO BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. I THINK YOU A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NO SPECIFIC COMMENT AT THIS TIME AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DR BRADY HEINER. I'M A PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY AND THE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY PROJECT REBOUND CONSORTIUM. SO I ADDRESS YOU TODAY AS THE REPRESENTATIVE FOR FOURTEEN PROGRAMS AT CSU CAMPUSES ACROSS THE STATE. THE MISSION PROJECT REBOUND IS TO SUPPORT THE HIGHER EDUCATION AND SUCCESSFUL REINTEGRATION OF FORMERLY INCARCERATED STUDENTS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF WHOM COME FROM HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED BACKGROUNDS. IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN THE LEGISLATURE INVESTED THREE POINT THREE MILLION ON GOING TO SUPPORT CSU PROJECT REBOUND PROGRAMS. IT'S MY PLEASURE TO REPORT ON THE SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC RETURN ON THE STATE'S INVESTMENT. JERRY GARCIA LEGISLATIVE STAFFERS PROVIDED THE COMMITTEE WITH THE FACT SHEET CONTAINING MANY METRICS OF OUR PROGRAM SUCCESS. IN THAT REPORT YOU WILL SEE THAT DURING TO PANDEMIC YEARS THE PROJECT CONSORTIUM MANAGED TO EXPAND FROM NINE CAMPUS PROGRAMS TO FOURTEEN CAMPUS PROGRAMS. WHAT IS THE ISSUE AS A WHOLE EXPERIENCED A DROP IN ENROLLMENT TO THE LOWEST LEVEL SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN. PROJECT REBOUND DOUBLE DARN MOMENT AND WHILE THE EQUITY GAP FOR UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY AND PELL RECIPIENTS STUDENTS ACROSS THE CSU HAS WIDENED DURING THE PANDEMIC. TWO THIRDS OF PROJECT REBOUND STUDENTS CONTINUE TO EARN A THREE POINT OH GPA OR HIGHER EVERY SEMESTER. AND COMPARED TO CALIFORNIA'S RECIDIVISM RATE OF 46% RECIDIVISM RATE AMONG STUDENTS IN OUR PROGRAMS IS LESS THAN 1% BUT EVERY CONCEIVABLE METRIC ARE PROGRAMS WORK AND WHILE I'M HAPPY TO DISCUSS THESE METRICS IN MY REMAINING TIME I'D LIKE TO SHARE AN EXAMPLE THAT CONVEYS THE SPIRIT THAT MAKES PROJECT REBOUND SO SUCCESSFUL. LAST WEEK A PROJECT REBOUND STUDENT AT CAL STATE FULLERTON DIED IN A TRAGIC CAR ACCIDENT. MICHAEL PRUDENT WAS POISED TO GRADUATE IN MAY WITH A THREE POINT NINE GPA. HE WAS ON HIS WAY TO A MASTER'S PROGRAM IN HIGHER EDUCATION LEADERSHIP AT CSU LONG BEACH. WHEN THE PROJECT REBOUND COMMUNITY LEARNED OF MIKE'S HOSPITALIZATION OVER A DOZEN STAFF AND STUDENTS FROM OUR FOR SISTER CAMPUSES IN THE REGION ARRIVED AT THE HOSPITAL TO OFFER SUPPORT. PROJECT REBOUND HELD HEALING CIRCLES IN WHICH MIKE'S FAMILY AND SOME THIRTY STAFF AND STUDENTS PARTICIPATED. DURING THOSE CIRCLES STUDENTS REFERRED TO MIKE AS A LIFELINE BECAUSE LIKE MANY OF OUR STUDENT EMPLOYEES. WROTE LETTERS TO THEM ON BEHALF OF PROJECT REBOUND WHILE THEY WERE STILL INCARCERATED. OFFERING ENCOURAGEMENT AND THE HOPE OF HIGHER EDUCATION. BUDGET REBOUND SENT FIVE THOUSAND SUCH LIFE LINES INTO CDCR THIS YEAR ALONE WHO ARE SAN WHO WERE ONCE SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON BUT WHO ARE NOW PURSUING CSU DEGREES EXPRESSED LOVE AND SHOWED UP FOR ONE ANOTHER LIKE FAMILY. STUDENTS VOICED GRATITUDE FOR PROJECT RENOWNED NOT ONLY FOR SUPPORTING THEM WITH ADMISSIONS AND ACADEMICS BUT FOR SHOWING BEEN BELOVED COMMUNITY. TEACHING THEM HOW TO PROCESS GRIEF AND ANGER YOU LOVE RATHER THAN THE PATTERNS OF ABUSE ADDICTION AND ORGANIZED ABANDONMENT THAT THEY EXPERIENCE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES OF ORIGIN AND THROUGH CARS FOR PUBLIC SYSTEMS. THAT'S WHAT MAKES PROJECT REBOUND SO SUCCESSFUL. OUR STAFF WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED INCARCERATION THEMSELVES PROVIDE OUR STUDENTS WHAT THEY SO DESPERATELY NEED. A FAMILY THAT ACCEPTS THEM AND UPLIFTS THEM TO BE THEIR BEST SELVES. MADAM CHAIR FOR THE LEDGES SUPPORTER PROJECT REBOUND SPEAK TO YOU TODAY. I THANK YOU TO THE PANELISTS ON THIS INSULT IT'S EXCITING TO SEE- THE SUCCESSES CONNECTED TO THIS EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS- BOTH IN AND OUT OUT THERE AND SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS ARE AND CONGRATULATIONS ON THOSE SUCCESSES SO ON A NIGHT THAT. AS WELL. HOW DO WE SCALE THIS UP RIGHT NOW AND SEVEN- PRESENTS A NOT ALL OVER CAL STATE ARE PARTICIPATING PROJECT REBOUND- AND- THE FUNDING BECAUSE RIGHT THE PROGRAM BUT HOW DID IT HOW DO WE SCALE THIS UP SO THAT IT'S AVAILABLE. IN ALL OF OUR PRESENCE IS THAT ALL OVER CALIPHATE'S PARTICIPATE IN A PROGRAM OVERSEEN STRONG CORRELATION FOR SUCCESS. OF THE FAR AS THE INDIVIDUALS. ON WE HAVE THOUGHT LIKE THAT. YEAH I HAVE BOUGHT ON THAT- AND I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE PROGRAM THAT WE'VE GOTTEN GOING SO FAR- IT IS OUR INTENTION TO SERVE. INCARCERATED FOLKS SAID EVERY SIX THIRTY LOCAL AS WELL AS EVERY GEOGRAPHIC AREA BUT IN THE LONG RUN MY HOPE IS THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. A HUB IN THE NOT FAR NORTHERN REGION OF THE STATE. AT LEAST ONE IN THE CENTRAL REGION AND THEN ONE IN THE SOUTH AND THEN ALSO FOR ALL THE DIFFERENT SECURITY LEVELS. NOW NOT ALL OF THE YEAH BURKE THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRISONS ARE WITHIN A LEGITIMATE REASONABLE DRIVING DISTANCE FROM. A. B. F. U. AND SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS REALLY. FOCUSED ON THOSE INSTITUTIONS. WHERE WE HAVE THE BEST. WHERE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHERE THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE IS DOING A FANTASTIC JOB OF COLLABORATING WITH MY STAFF ON THE INSIDE TO GET STUDENTS THROUGH THEIR- THEIR- POST SECONDARY PROGRAMMING. AND THEN- REALLY FOCUSING AND ALSO ON THOSE- INSTITUTION AND THE ISSUES THAT HAVE A STRONG- PROJECT REBOUND PROGRAM SO IN THE SHORT TERM AS THE FEDERAL HELLO. BECOMES THE REALITY NEXT YEAR RATED BIGELOW AND SOME OF THE CURRENT CHALLENGES THAT OUR FOLKS. HAVE TO DEAL WITH WITH HELLO AS THOSE RESTRICTIONS ARE LIFTED AND THINGS GET A LITTLE BIT EASIER WE DO ANTICIPATE INCREASED NUMBER. SO WHAT MY HOPE IS THAT WE GO AHEAD AND FIND THESE SEVEN AND THEN COME BACK YOU IN A YEAR AND THEY LOOK LOOK HOW GREAT THAT SAYS WE HAVE MANY MORE STUDENTS- HOW CAN WE EXPAND. THE END OF THE SO THERE'S THE THANK YOU MISS AND MISS WHEN INCOME. ON THE SUCCESS WITH THE FAR- IS THERE A PLAN ALREADY THAT'S BEEN DEVELOPED OR THE PLAN BEING DEVELOPED SO THAT WE GO PAST THE SEVEN AND PASSED MIXTURE. SO THAT THE SISTER OF A PATHWAY FORWARD FOR US ALREADY THAT'S BEEN PLANNED. YEAH SO WHAT WE'VE DONE- IS WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE- FOUNDATION. COULD TAKE A DEEP DIVE INTO OUR COLLEGE DATA TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COLLEGE. BACHELOR'S DEGREE PROGRAMS THAT WERE IMPLEMENTING MADE THE GREATEST MOST SIGNIFICANTLY. SO FOCUSING ON FOR EXAMPLE LEVEL TO- POPULATION SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THOSE STUDENTS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE THEIR BA. NOW EQUITY IS A HUGE ISSUE FOR ME AND HELLO- I WAS NOT WILLING TO MOVE FORWARD UNTIL WE GET OUT THE SERVER WOMEN. SO WE HAVE A NASCENT PATHWAY AT CALIFORNIA CENTRAL CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S FACILITY- WE'RE TALKING WITH COCKTAIL A ABOUT- THE FUTURE PROGRAM AT THE I. W. THE HEAD MEETING LAST WEEK ON FRIDAY WITH A CAL POLY HUMBLE. AND SAN DIEGO STATE WERE INTERESTED IN SERVING THE IMPERIAL VALLEY. SO THAT THE GOAL WOULD BE TO GET THE PROGRAM UP AND FULLY FUNCTIONAL. ONCE WE SEE WHAT THE DEMAND IS. ONE HELL IS OUT REPENTED AND ALL THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS ARE COMPLETED BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT YET DONE- THEN WE'D BE. HOW MANY STUDENTS WE HAVE PREPARED AND MOVE FORWARD AT THAT TIME WITH THOSE. PRESENT THAT ARE WITHIN AN APPROPRIATE DEFINITION OF A- YEAR. THAT IS INTERESTED IN PARTNERING WITH US. WHEN WENDY. IF IN YOUR IDEAL. WORLD MATHIS QUESTIONS AS I'M EAGER TO SEE THIS EVERYWHERE SO- IN YOUR EYE AND I WORRY ABOUT EQUITY SO IN YOUR IDEAL WORLD WHEN DO YOU. WHAT'S THE TIME LINE AS YOU AS- AS YOU'RE WORKING AND EXPANDING WHAT THE TIME LINE IN YOUR HEAD OF YOUR IDEAL WILL BEFORE WE COULD SEE THIS AND- MOST OF OUR- PRESENCE. ALL RIGHT NOW IN A DEFENSIVE THE CSU PROGRAMS THAT WERE- WORKING TO FIRM UP AND EXPANDS WE ALSO HAVE ONE PRIVATE OF BACHELORS DEGREE PROGRAM AND- ARRANGEMENT WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE THE THIRD STUDENTS THAT ARE J. DONOVAN SO- AND THEY HAVE DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES- THROUGH THEIR OWN INTER CAMPUS RESOURCES SO IN ADDITION TO THE SEVEN THAT WERE ASKING FOR THE FUNDING FOR WE HAVE A FEW MORE- ABOUT THREE ACTUALLY BECAUSE YEAH W. R. J. D. AND- THE- R. SOME. BATCHES DEGREE OPPORTUNITY. SO MY ANTICIPATION WOULD BE ONCE WE SEE THE IMPACT THAT HELD NEXT YEAR- BY THE TIME WE GET TO THE TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE SCHOOL YEAR WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SO MANY STUDENTS READY FOR COLLEGE AND BEYOND THAT WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK TO YOU AND SAY LOOK THIS IS REALLY WORKING. WE NEED THE FUNDING TO HAD JUST EXPAND. AND OF COURSE WE HAVE THE SAME KINDS OF ISSUES THAT YOU CARE ABOUT ALL THE TIME FROM CDC. MAY HAVE TO THE COVERAGE OF THE KINDS OF THINGS AND WHAT WE'VE DONE IS COLLABORATED- SO THAT THAT THE ADULT BASIC EDUCATION PROGRAM THAT. OCCURRED DURING THE DAY ARE SECOND WATCH- AND RCTV PROGRAM. RYAN DURING THE DAY AND THEN THE COLLEGE PROGRAMMING BEGAN. APPROXIMATELY TWO OR THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THE CLASS AND STATE- BASES ARE AVAILABLE. WE'RE SHARING AND WE'RE DEVELOPING SIMULTANEOUSLY MULTI USE. BATHROOMS THAT CAN BE USED BY ANY GROUP WISHING TO COME IN SO WHERE YOU THIN LEVERAGING TECHNOLOGY TO DO THAT SO THAT THE FACE CAN BE SHARED BUT THERE'S- THERE'S A LOT GOING ON. THAT WILL ULTIMATELY BE I BELIEVE CONTRIBUTE TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR LONG TERM GOALS FOR HIGHER. EDUCATION WE ARE. THANK YOU THE WAY HAVE ANY. MISTER CHANG I'M SURE IF I MAY. THE BRADY FROM PROJECT REBOUND. I'M IF I THE STATE BLUE O INVEST IN HIGH EDUCATION FOR CURRENTLY AND FORMERLY INCARCERATED CALIFORNIANS I REALLY IMPLORE YOU TO THINK AND INVEST IN- IN THE CREATION OF A STUDENT CENTERED ECOSYSTEM REALLY THAT THAT NOT JUST INVOLVE CDCR BUT ALL THREE PUBLIC POST SECONDARY EDUCATIONAL SEGMENTS BECAUSE- IN ORDER TO SUCCEED THE STUDENTS MUST NAVIGATE THROUGH ALL OF THESE COMPLEX SYSTEMS AND THAT REQUIRES THE SUPPORT OF COORDINATED PROCESS THESE. COORDINATED AND DEDICATED PRACTITIONERS- AND NOT JUST A KIND OF PIECEMEAL AMALGAM OF STATE INSTITUTIONS THAT DESPITE THEIR BEST INTENTIONS OFTEN WORK SIMPLY TO REPRODUCE THEIR THEIR OWN BUREAUCRACIES- SO FOR INSTANCE FROM PROJECT REBOUNDS PERSPECTIVE WE'VE MAPPED THE STATE AND CREATED OUTREACH TEAMS ASSIGNED TO PARTICULAR CDCR FACILITIES. SENATE BILL FOUR SIXTEEN- JUST LAST YEAR PLACE TO STATUTORY PRIORITY ON COLLEGE PROGRAMS WITHIN CDCR- TO WORK WITH- THE CSU PROJECT REBOUND CONSORTIUM THE RISING SCHOLARS NETWORK IN OUR- IN OUR SISTER SYSTEM- AND YET OUR OUTREACH TEAMS HAVE VERY INCONSISTENT ACCESS. TO PROVIDE THAT THAT IMPORTANT PRE MATRICULATION ADVISING AND WARM HANDOFF THAT SHIPMENTS WEIGHING MENTIONS I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO FROM TO FOREGROUND THAT THE SUCCESS OF PROJECT REBOUND IS ESSENTIALLY CONTINGENT UPON THE FACT THAT THE MAJORITY OF OUR STAFF HAVING INCARCERATION EXPERIENCE THEMSELVES THAT'S PART OF WHAT CREATES THE CREDIBLE MESSENGERS- THAT THAT LEAD TO OUR RECRUITMENT AND OUR PERSISTENCE SUCCESS IN HIGHER RENT. AND SO YOU MIGHT EXPECT THAT OUR STAFF HAVE EXPERIENCE INCONSISTENT- APPROVAL WHEN IT COMES TO ACCESS IT'S A- TO PROVIDE THAT THAT'D- SO HAVING SOMETHING FOR INSTANCE LIKE GREEN CARDS FOR PROJECT REBOUND APPROVED OUTREACH TEAMS- I THINK WOULD GO A LONG WAY TOWARD CREATING SOME OF THOSE THOSE PATHWAYS THOSE THOSE PRISON TO COLLEGE. PIPELINES THE MISS NGUYEN MENTIONS. I 100% AGREE WITH YOU BRADY I COULDN'T AGREE MORE AND I'LL- TELL YOU THAT IT'S BEEN A FRUSTRATING FOR ALL OF US. FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS- WHEN AS YOU KNOW OUR INSTITUTIONS HAVE BEEN SHUT DOWN THE MODIFIED PROGRAMMING SO NOBODY FROM THE OUTSIDE BEEN ABLE TO COME IN. AND IT IT- YOU KNOW WHEN I THINK ABOUT THAT BUT FIND THAT WE'VE MET. REBOUND FOLK OR RIDING DOLLARS REPRESENTATIVES IN PARKING LOT TO EXCHANGE STUDENT WORKS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S WORK STILL DIFFERENT BY THE INSTITUTION I MEAN THAT. THE DESIRE IS THERE IT IT NOW THAT THINGS ARE OPENING UP AGAIN I REALLY ANTICIPATE BEING- EVEN MORE. OF THAT THAT WARM HAND OFF. THAT THAT IS THE IDEAL. THANK YOU DIRECTORS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE R. HATER. YOU YOU BOTH I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD BE COMMENDED FOR. THE GREAT JOB YOU'RE BOTH DOING. ON THIS PROGRAM ARE QUITE OFTEN IN THIS. SUBCOMMITTEE WE HEAR A LITANY OF EXCUSES OF WHY THINGS CAN'T BE DONE. AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOU IGNORING ALL OF THOSE REASONS WHY WE CAN'T DO THINGS AND JUST REALLY. DOING DOING YOUR JOB AND SO JUST JUST SO I UNDERSTAND THE METRICS AND LET ME ALSO THANK YOU FOR YOUR METRICS BECAUSE- I DON'T HAVE TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT ALL THE VARIOUS METRICS BECAUSE YOU 5% OF THE FOREST. ON SO FROM TWENTY NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE I JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND JUST WANNA JUST BE REITERATED BE-CLEAR. HE WENT FROM THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY CENTS A ROLE TO FIVE SIXTY SIX. AND THEN GRADUATING. YOU WENT FROM SIXTY ONE TO ONE FIFTY ONE- SAME TIME FRAME IT ALSO. YOU ROLLED GRADUATE STUDENTS FROM TWENTY NINE TO NINETY FIVE IN MY IN MY READING THAT CORRECTLY. I JUST REMEMBER. LOWS THIS IS BRADY HEINER FROM PROJECT REBOUND- THE METRICS THAT YOU'RE CITING OUR METRICS FROM THE CSU PROJECT REBOUND CONSORTIUM SO THOSE ARE OUR STUDENTS WHO ARE- EARNING DEGREES ON CAL STATE UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES OUTSIDE OF CCR BUT YES ALL THOSE METRICS ARE ARE CORRECT. GOD I GOT AND I GOT A GUEST DIRECT SUPERINTENDENTS WHITE HOUSE HAS OTHER NUMBERS SEPARATE FROM. PROJECT REBOUND I SAID. YES THE NUMBERS THAT THAT I HAVE AT THIS POINT I JUST THIS PAST YEAR- SO IN ALL OF. TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE GRADUATED OUR FIRST. COHORT OF STUDENTS FROM CAL STATE LA I'M INSIDE THE LEVEL FOR HIGH SECURITY INSTITUTION- TWENTY FIVE MEN AREN'T THERE. ARE COLLEGE DEGREES THAT BACHELOR'S DEGREES IT WAS. AN UNBELIEVABLE UNBELIEVABLE EXPERIENCE AND THEN WHAT I THINK IS INTERESTING AND WORTHWHILE TO NOTE IS THE FACT THAT- EIGHT OF THE- UNIT THAT STARTED BACK COPART. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WITH HEALTHCARE LA- I'M ESPECIALLY GOT THEIR SENTENCES REDUCED STORE COMMUTED THE IMPORTANT LIFE FIRST. AND THEY GOT OUT AND THEY WENT ON TO CAMPUS AT CAL STATE LA BECAUSE OF THE SUPPORT THEY HAD TO PROJECT REBOUND IT WOULD SEEM WHAT. THEY WERE ABLE TO HAVE HOUSING THEY HAVE THEIR FOOD NEEDS MET THEY HAD ALL THOSE MAD LOS YOU KNOW HIERARCHY OF NEEDS MET. AND THEN THEY WERE ABLE TO WALK ACROSS THE BOARD- THEY EARN THEIR THEIR BACHELOR OF ARTS DEGREE IN WITH THE REST OF THE CAMPUS- YOU DON'T POPULATION. LAST JULY SO. IT IT IT- TIRED. CORRECTIONAL EDUCATION ACCOUNT. AND THE MULTI. IMPACT OF CAN'T BE. AND RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE. FOURTEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS EARNING THEIR TRANSFERABLE ASSOCIATE OF ARTS DEGREE WE JUST HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE. A PLACE TO GO NEXT RIGHT SO THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO LEARN. THANK YOU CAN CAN YOU Q- PROGRESS TOWARDS THEIR TOWARDS THEIR GOAL TO DON'T TOTALLY AGREE AND WE WANT TO SUPPORT YOU AS MUCH AS- WE CAN AND I KNOW THAT WHEN I HAD A CHANCE TO VISIT SOUTH AFRICA'S IT WAS UNFORTUNATE- THE IN A COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROFESSOR THAT I BELIEVE USED TO GO THERE. HADN'T BEEN THERE AND WHAT WITHIN THE WAY THE INMATES TALKED ABOUT I THOUGHT THEY HADN'T BEEN THERE ARE MAYBE A FEW MONTHS BECAUSE THE PERCENT RETIRED. IN TWO YEARS SINCE ALL OBVIOUSLY WE WANNA- INSURE THAT THOSE RESOURCES ARE BEING. CONNECTED AT A TIME WHEN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE ENROLLMENT IS DOWN. THERE'S NO REASON. FOR THEM NOT TO GO TO THEIR NEAREST FACILITY TO WORK WORK. ON INCARCERATED INMATES WHO WANNA ONE OF LOWER MANHATTAN I CAN'T IMAGINE A BETTER REACHED BETTER USE OF RESOURCES FOR THE STATE. AND CLEARLY- YOU HAVE THE DATA TO BACK UP YOUR RESULTS. I THINK. YOU KNOW SPECIFICALLY IS JUST A MUCH BETTER USE FOR PEOPLE'S TIME. TO BE PART OF THAT SYSTEM ON. THE IN THE VISITING THIS. PROPOSAL THE FIVE MILLION THAT'S PROPOSED FOR GENERAL FUND TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE- IS ANY OF THAT GOING TO PROJECT REBOUNDER THIS IS JUST. I BELIEVE FOR YOU FROM YOUR OFFICE TO PRETEND TO SWIM I'M SORRY. THAT'S FOR MY OFFICE AS WELL AS FOR TUITION AND OTHER SUPPORT FOR THE STUDENTS. SO WE NEED TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO THE CSU IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE PROGRAMS IN THE UNIT. AND ONCE WE GET HEALTH I THINK THAT'S WHY WE HAVE HAD A LOWER COST FOR THE SUBSEQUENT YEARS BECAUSE NEXT YEAR. ON JULY FIRST- HELD WILL BE TURNED. ALL OF OUR GREAT BUT WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE HEALTH PLAN WITHOUT SOME OF THE REALLY DIFFICULT BARRIERS. THAT RETAINING IN THEIR WAY LIKE. EVENTS AND ETCETERA GOT IT IN FOR THE CSU STUDENTS HOW MANY SINCE YOU STUDENTS IS THAT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FUNDING FOR THAT ALSO INCLUDE ALL OF THE EIGHT DEGREES YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AS WELL. BEAT THE EIGHT DEGREES ARE- YOU KNOW THAT 99% OF OUR STUDENTS GETTING THEIR ASSOCIATE OFARTS DEGREES ARE ON A CALL A CALIFORNIA PROMISED FRANCE SO THEY'RE FINDING IT HARDER- WHAT DEATH FUNDING WILL DO IF THE COURT. THE- FIFTY STUDENT AT MILL CREEK FIFTY AT BOTH- THERE'S- A HUNDRED IT WILL BE UP TO ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED STUDENTS IN BACHELOR OF ARTS DEGREE THREE CSU IF THE FUNDING FOR THE- I GOT AND THEN. THIS IS SEPARATE FROM PROJECT REBOUND IS THAT CORRECT PROFESSOR TOTALLY SEPARATE YEAH TOTALLY SEPARATE. YEAH FOR A BIT BUT ARE THE BUT THINK OF CLEARER ON. YEAH WE JUST HEARD PROPOSAL EARLIER THAT WE HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TIME UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE MONEY WAS GOING THE FIFTEENTH. OF MUCH CLEARER IN TERMS OF AN INDUCTIVELY MUCH CLEARER IN TERMS OF THE RESULTS. YOU KNOW THE WE KNOW WHAT THAT THE REHABILITATION. PART OF THE DEPARTMENT IS THE NAME IS RATHER NEW- WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING THIS SEEMS LIKE A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY FRANKLY CONSIDERING THE PAST PRESENT OR HAND. SO WE DEFINITELY WANT TO BE. SUPPORTIVE OF YOUR EFFORTS AS WELL AS OUR PROFESSOR HUNTERS EFFORTS. SO ON. PLEASE LET US KNOW WHAT WE CAN. CONTINUE TO DO STREETS OF PORT YOUR EFFORTS BECAUSE WITH THE OBVIOUSLY I I'VE I PERSONALLY THE MORE STUDENTS. YOU HAVE- TO LET LESS LIKELY TO DOUBLE THE LESS RECIDIVISM WE'RE GOING TO HAVE. I THINK THE BETTER THE BETTER OUR STATE IS GOING TO BE SO PLEASE FROM- WE'LL LET LET LET US KNOW HOW WE CAN SUPPORT YOU LIKE I SAID THIS NUMBER SEEMS FAIRLY. MODEST CONSIDERING THE TASK THAT YOU'RE TACKLING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT. IT IS A MEMBER THANK YOU ALL THINK YOU WERE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON AND WE APPRECIATE THAT THEY WERE GONNA MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FOUR- FOR ISSUE NUMBER FOUR WE HAVE VARIOUS BUDGET PROPOSALS. UNTIL WE'VE DIVIDED UP INTO THREE STUFF PANELS. I WILL STATUS AFTER EACH THE PANEL WITH UP TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS. FROM THE MEMBERS BEFORE WE PROCEED. AND WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND START WITH THE PANEL NUMBER ONE WHICH IS RE PURPOSING CONDEMNED HOUSING. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY I'M RON DAVIS SOCI DIRECTOR DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS. CDCR REQUESTS ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR A CONSULTING CONTRACT TO EVALUATE AND MAKE RESIDENT RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING. THE RE PURPOSING OF CONTENT HOUSING AND SUPPORT SPACES AT SAN QUENTIN. THIS CONTRACT WILL HELP DEVELOP IDEAS HOW THIS EXISTING SPACE CAN BE USED TO CREATE A POSITIVE HEALING ENVIRONMENT. THAT PROVIDES INCREASED REHABILITATIVE EDUCATION AND HEALTHCARE OPPORTUNITIES THANK. THIS PROPOSAL PROVIDES FUNDING TO EVALUATE EXISTING SPACE AND PROVIDE INNOVATIVE IDEAS FOR FUTURE USE I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ON THIS PROPOSAL THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE KNOWN YOU THE L. ALES OFFICE CAITLIN O'NEILL YEAH. THANK YOU CAITLIN O'NEILL WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- THE ARCHITECTURE AT SAN QUENTIN BANKS LOOTING BE HOUSING FACILITY AND THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS PROPOSAL HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC DURING THE EAST COAST AND I TÍNH PANDEMIC. THAT'S BECAUSE THE FACILITY CONSISTS ESSENTIALLY OF FIVE TIERS OF CELLS STACKED ON TOP OF EACH OTHER WITH OPEN BAR DOORS THAT ALLOW AIR TO FLOW IN AND OUT OF THE CELLS- AND SO THAT MEANS THAT- INFECTED AIR CAN PASS BUT- BETWEEN CELLS THAT ARE BETWEEN NEIGHBORING CELLS OR INFECTED DROPLETS CAN FALL FROM THE TOP TIER TO THE BOTTOM ENTERING STYLE THE ONE WAY. THE FACILITY ALSO AS WE UNDERSTAND DOESN'T HAVE- VERY GOOD INTAKE OF OUTSIDE AIR AND EXCHANGE OF AIR BECAUSE MANY OF THE WINDOWS ARE WILD WELL THE CHILD AND- ESSENTIALLY THAT FACILITIES- HOUSING MANY OF HOUSING FACILITIES AT SAN QUENTIN ESSENTIALLY HAVE. INDUSTRIAL FANS THAT SORT OF RECIRCULATING. EXISTING AREAS WITHIN THE FACILITY- AND WHILE CDC ARE FULLY DEFINED THE SCOPE OF WHAT IT'S PLANNING TO ASK A CONSULTANT TO THE PROPOSED CONSULTANT TO- ASSESS AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON. THE DEPARTMENT INDICATES THAT IT DOESN'T PLAN TO REQUIRE THAT IT CONSULTANT TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO ADDRESS THESE PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS. AND SO WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THIS WOULD EITHER LEAVE IMPORTANT ISSUES UNADDRESSED- OR TO THE EXTENT THAT THE DEPARTMENT LATER CHOSE TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES SUCH AS BY. MODIFYING FACILITIES TEN- IMPROVE. BE TRANSFERRED ERROR AND- AN INTAKE OF AIR OUTSIDE AIR. AND IT COULD REQUIRE POTENTIALLY I'M DOING ARE DESTROYING- THE MODIFICATIONS THAT ARE RECOMMENDED BY HIS EAP CONSULTANT. THAT'S BEING PROPOSED. I AND SO WE WOULD THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIRECTED DEPARTMENT TO REPORT AT SPRING BUDGET HEARINGS ON THE DEFINED SCOPE OF THE PROPOSED CONSULTANTS WORK. SECOND THE RATIONALE FOR NOT HAVING THE CONSOLE WE CONSIDER THE PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS THAT I JUST CRIED. AND THIRD THE COST OF REQUIRING THE CONSULTANT TO CONSIDER THOSE CONCERNS AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO ADDRESS THEM. THANK YOU. LET ME SOLANO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AS FAR AS ADDRESSING THE SCOPE AND POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL COSTS THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE FINAL AMOUNT COULD BE SLIGHTLY HIGHER LOWER DEPENDING ON THE FINALIZED GO- AS THE PROJECT IS- AS THE DETAILS ARE DETERMINED BY THE DEPARTMENT AND THE CONTRACTOR HOWEVER THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES IT'S A REASONABLEFIGURE FOR THE WORK AND THE ADMINISTRATION HASN'T AND WE DON'T PLAN TO PRECLUDE THE CONSULTANT FROM CONSIDERING PER. PERTINENT PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS WHEN MAKING A RECOMMENDATION AND WE REITERATE THATTHE PURPOSE OF THE ASSESSMENT AND ULTIMATE RECOMMENDATION IS TO GENERATE IDEAS ON THE BEST USE OF THE SPACE TO CREATE ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE INCARCERATED POPULATION. THANK YOU. FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SO I AREAS THAT YOU'RE YOU DON'T PRECLUDE THE CONSULTANT FROM CONSIDERING BUT ARE WE ASKING THE CONSULTANT BEING SPECIFIC THAT WE WOULD LIKE THEM TO CONSIDER HEALTH IMPROVED AND- IMPLICATIONS I THINK AS WE ARE ENTERING OUR THIRTY YEAR OF THE PANDEMIC. I SEEMS SOMETHING REASONABLE TO ADD TO THE SCOPE. THIRTY SENATOR PER MINUTE. BINANCE AT AT AT THIS TIME WE HAVEN'T SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED WHAT THE PLAN IS IN THOSE DETAILS WILL BE SORTED OUT BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT AND THE CONSULTANT ASKING THE FORWARD. AND SO COME SPRING WILL YOU BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SOME OF THAT INFORMATION FOR US. WHEN HE SHREDDED PERFECT FINANCE I BELIEVE THAT WON'T HAPPEN UNTIL THE DEPARTMENT ENGAGES WITH THE CONSULTANT- WHICH WOULDN'T BEGIN IN THE SPRING. BUT YOU'RE ASKING US FOR THE MONEY AHEAD OF TIME EVEN THOUGH WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE- WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE PAYING FOR. THIS IS A VERY PRUDENT THAT WERE. ANY MONEY TOWARD SOMETHING THAT WE'RE NOT SURE WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IT. AT THIS POINT THE DEPARTMENT HAS IDENTIFIED THE SPECIFIC CRITERIA- AND- WE'VE LEFT IT PRETTY WIDE OPEN ADD TO CHART TO DETERMINE WHAT. WHAT'S WITH ALL THE NEEDS THAT THEY MAY POPULATION THE PAST. I THINK FOR MYSELF WITH MEMBER THE LEGISLATURE AND CHECKS AND BALANCES AND HAVING TO BE RESPONSIVE TO. THE VOTERS I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE BEING PRUDENT UNTIL THOSE DETAILS. ARE GOING TO BE IMPORTANT TO US EVER GOING TO BE MOVING FORWARD WITH WITH THESE PROPOSALS WHETHER IT'S A MODEST AMOUNT OR A LARGE AMOUNT I GENERAL I THINK YOU'VE HEARD US REPEAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT WE WANT TO DETAILS. TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN AND WHAT WE'RE INVESTING IN. WITH THE PHONE. LINE THAT YOU DROPPED YOUR- SERVICES RECEIVED I THINK. I'M SORRY WE'RE HAVING A HARD TIME HEARING HERE WHERE THAT IS SPEAKING. MODELLEN THE CLAIM THAT BE DIRECTOR FISCAL SERVICES FOR CDC ARE YES. IN GONNA. APOLOGIES THANK YOU- IS SO THE FUNDING THAT WE'RE REQUESTING IS TO START THAT WORK WITH THE CONSULTANTS SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT DETAILS RIGHT NOW OUR- THOUGHT. PRECISE DETAILS ARE NOT AVAILABLE RIGHT THIS MOMENT BUT THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE FUNDING IS TO ENGAGE WITH A CONSULTANT IS TO WORK OUT. OF WORK AND IT TELLS US THAT THEY CAN COMPLETE THEIR EVALUATION ASSESSMENT AND PROVIDE A REPORT BACK THAT WE WOULD THEN COME FOR LEGISLATORS. TO REQUEST ADDITIONAL MONEY TO IMPLEMENT SOME OF THOSE ITEMS- ORDER. OR BEFORE IN A DIFFERENT WAY SO THIS IS JUST THE INITIAL FOR RIGHT OR A INTO DETERMINING THE BEST A USE THAT THE SPACE. SO WE WANT. AT ANY POINT TIME WE WOULDN'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION UNTIL WE ACTUALLY ENGAGE WITH THE CONTRACTOR TO DO THAT WE WOULD NEED FUNDING TO START AT. THAT EXECUTE THE CONTRACT. I THINK WHEN WE ENTER NEGOTIATIONS FOR A CONTRACTOR STATUS ANYBODY THAT NEEDS TO BE THERE AT THE VERY BEGINNING. TO DO THAT AND I THINK THAT WOULD JUST. BE PRUDENT IF YOU TAKE OUR ADVICE. THAT YOU HAVE SOME OF THE SCHOOL FIGURE IT OUT. I THINK YOU'RE ASKING A CONTRACTED TO GIVE YOU AN ESTIMATE OR ENTER INTO SOMETHING THAT'S SOMETHING PRETTY BASIC THAT THEY'RE ALSO. GOING TO WANT. TO HAVE FROM FROM YOU SO THAT THEY CAN GIVE YOU YOU KNOW AT A FAIR FLOW. OUT THERE INTO JUST. ADDING BASIC CONTRACT IN ONE ON ONE SO I THINK IF YOU WANT. TO BE YOUR PARTNERS AND WE WANT TO BE PARTNERS INFORMATION IS. IMPORTANT WE KEEP GETTING. AREAS PROPOSALS WITH LITTLE INFORMATION JUST ASKING US TO TRUST YOU AND IT'LL COME TOGETHER LATER BUT THAT THEN. IT'S ASKING US NOT TO DO OUR JOB. WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO THE NEXT- SUB PANEL. WITH THE CAL PH EDITORIAL EXPANSION. GOOD AFTERNOON DAVE LEWIS W. DIRECTOR OF FACILITIES PLANNING ACTIVATION MANAGEMENT- CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES- WE ARE REQUESTING FUNDING TO SUPPORT A JANITORIAL CONTRACT WITH CAL P. I. A. THIS OUT FOR THE HEALTH FACILITIES MANAGEMENT PROGRAM THIS CONTRACT PROVIDES- FOR THE PROGRAM WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CLEANING AND SANITIZING DIRECT PATIENT CARE AREAS WITHIN- CCR INSTITUTIONS. THESE RESOURCES WILL SUPPORT HAVE MEANT ADDITIONAL AS REVISED THREE POSITIONS TO REDUCE THE SUPERVISORY RATIO FROM ABOUT FORTY TO ONE TO TWENTY ONE TO ALLOW. THE SUPERVISORS PROVIDE MORE MENTORING AND TRAINING TO OUR CAR STRAIGHT POPULATION THAT WORKS FOR THEM- AND IT ALSO INCREASES THE NUMBER OF SERVICE AREAS THAT WE ARE ABLE TO SERVICE- REFLECTING SOME ADDITIONAL- AREAS THAT THEY CHECK ON PROGRAM IS TAKING OVER INCLUDING THE PSYCHIATRIC INPATIENT PROGRAM HEADS TO HIS FELLOW STATE PRISON AND STANDALONE DENTAL CLINICS AND ALSO WE CONSTRUCTED HEALTHCARE FACILITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM SPACE- DOES COME ONLINE SINCE THE CONTRACT WAS FIRST INITIATED FOR POSTING. EMPLOYMENT THROUGH A CERTIFIED HEALTHCARE ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES NATIONAL PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY THE CAL PIA'S STAFF. WITH THE M. AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE FOR THIS PROPOSAL. HI THIS IS ORLANDO AT THE LEGISLATIVE APPLE THE SAUCES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. WE VIEW THIS PROPOSAL AS HAVING TWO COMPONENTS- THE FIRST IS THAT A PROPOSES TO EXPAND THE CONTRACT CONTINUE HEALTHCARE FACILITIES AS HEARD AND THEN THE SECOND IS TO PROPOSED CHANGES. I IN THE RATIO OF CUSTODIAN SUPERVISORS TAKE A STUDY AND STAFF AND THEREFORE WE ASSESSED THE PROPOSAL IN THESE TWO COMPONENTS THAT ARE- NOT SPACED OUT WITHIN THE PROPOSAL THAT GIVEN THAT THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY CAL PA HAVE BEEN AT AN ACCEPTABLE STANDARD THAT IT DOES NOT RAISE CONCERNS. WE FIND THE PROPOSAL TO EXPAND THE CONTRACT TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL HEALTH CARE FACILITIES REASONABLE. BUT WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE THE FUNDING NECESSARY TO EXPAND INTO NEW HEALTH CARE FACILITIES. HOWEVER WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THE SECOND PART OF THE PROPOSAL TO CHANGE THE RATIO CUSTODIAN SUPERVISORS TO CUSTODIAN STAFF. I THOUGHT OUR ASSESSMENT CHANGING THE RATIO APPEARS UNNECESSARY AND THIS IS FOR TWO REASONS. THE FIRST IS THAT WHILE COUNTY A RAISES PROBLEMS RESULTING FROM LACK OF SUPERVISORS. SO DOES NOT PROPERLY KEEPING INVENTORY OR NOT PROVIDING TIMELY EVALUATIONS WE NOTE THAT THESE PROBLEMS HAVE NOT BEEN SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH. TO IMPACT THE QUALITY OF SERVICE PROVIDED THE SECOND REASON WE WANT WHITE CHANGING THE SUPERVISOR TO STAFF RATIO APPEARS UNNECESSARY. THAT CAP YEAH HAS NOT CLEARLY INDICATED HOW THE ADDITIONAL SUPERVISORS PROPOSED. WOULD IN FACT ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEMS THEY'VE IDENTIFIED FOR EXAMPLE IT'S POSSIBLE THAT OTHER ACTIONS SUCH AS ADDITIONAL TRAINING. IS ONE POSSIBILITY AMONG SEVERAL OTHERS THAT WOULD ADDRESS THAT IDENTIFIED PROBLEMS IN A MORE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT MANNER. FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE WRONG IMPROVE THE FUNDING NECESSARY TO EXPAND. INTO THE NEW HEALTH CARE FACILITIES WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE TO RACK CAL QUE TO REPORT THE AMOUNT OF THE REQUESTED FUNDING. ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGING THE CUSTODIAN SUPERVISOR RATIO SEPARATELY FROM EXPANDING THE CONTRACT. WE KNOW THAT AT THE TIME OF OUR ANALYSIS LPA WAS UNABLE TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION- BUT BASED ON LIMITED DATA WE ESTIMATE THAT SEVERAL MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THE REQUESTED FUNDING IS RELATED TO CHANGING THE SUPERVISOR TO STAFF RATIO. THANK YOU NOT BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. DR MADAM AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT'S A SENTIMENT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. OKAY THIRTY IN SUPERVISORY RATIOS AS YOU'VE HEARD AVERAGE ABOUT FORTY INCARCERATED AND CIVIL SERVICE STUDENTS JACK TWO ONE IN CIVIL SERVICES CUSTODIAN SUPERVISOR. SUPERVISORY POSITIONS ARE ABOUT OVERSIGHT STAFF DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING. CALCAVECCHIA'S GOALS ARE TWO FOLD THE FIRST IS TO PROVIDE QUALITY JANITORIAL SERVICES AND SECONDLY TO ENHANCE PUBLIC SAFETY BY PROVIDING INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS PRODUCTIVE WORK AND TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE EMPLOYABILITY POSTING CURSE RATIONS. INCREASING THE NUMBER OF SUPERVISORS WOULD ALLOW CALTRAIN IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF SERVICES AND BETTER EET THEIR MISSION BY PROVIDING WORK FEEDBACK IN TRAINING. ON THE JOB TRAINING WHICH IS CRITICAL TO ANYONE'S JOB PERFORMANCE EFFECTIVE FEEDBACK- CONTROL AND OVERSIGHT OF INVENTORY IN ROPHECIES INSURING APPROPRIATE STAFF INTERACTIONS FINDING AND KEEPING QUALIFIED STAFF WHICH THERE IS- HAS BEEN SOME TURNOVER WITH THE CUSTODIAN STAFF. AND REALLY CONDUCTING THOSE CLEANLINESS AUDITS AUDITS TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS A FULL THREE SIXTY FEEDBACK- FOR THOSE SERVICES. SO THIS IS WHY- THE PROPOSAL WOULD CHANGE THAT SUPERVISORY RATIO- AND I WOULD PROVIDE CALCULATE- TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE COLLEGE OUR GUIDANCE ON CUSTODIAN SUPERVISOR RATIO. THANK YOU AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ON IT AND I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE- AT THE CC WE DIDN'T GET- COSTS FOR THE EXPANSION VERSUS THE SUPERVISORS SO THE EXPANSION WOULD WOULD BE ROUGHLY ABOUT FIVE MILLION PER YEAR WHERE IS FORCE AND- INCREASE IN SUPERVISORS- AS- THE BREAKOUT SACRAMENTO MENTIONED WOULD BE- THREE POINT SIX MILLION IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND THEN FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION- IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AND THEREAFTER. THANK YOU. I THANK YOU SO ARE YOU I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE SUPERVISOR RATIO PIECE FOR. A MINUTE IN AND WHAT IS OUR ULTIMATE GOAL FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE INCARCERATED FALL BOTH THE QUALITY OF THE JANITORIAL SERVICES. BUT THEN ALSO PROVIDING THE SKILL SET- WOULD AND AS SEEN AS A VOCATIONAL PROGRAM PROGRAM THAT WOULD THEN BE ABLE TO LEAD TO- EMPLOYMENT ONCE ONCE THEY LEAVE- THE PRESENT. DO WE HAVE ANY DATA ARE WE TRACKING WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS ACTUALLY WORKING AS A VOCATIONAL PROGRAM OR THESE INDIVIDUALS WALKING OUT WITH SOME SORT OF CERTIFICATION. ARE THEY LANDING JOBS IN THIS IN THIS PROFESSION ONCE THEY LEAVE AND HOW AND SALAS IS THE SUCCESS RATE THERE TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THIS IS ACTUALLYA REAL VOCATIONAL PROGRAM AND NOT JUST. ANOTHER MEANS TO ACCOMPLISH THE GOAL OF CLEANING HAVING CLEAN A CLEAN CENTER- CAL PA DOES NOT TRACK. SUCCESS RATES FOR PLACEMENT POST INCARCERATION AND UNFORTUNATELY- SO WE DO NOT HAVE ANY. DATA REGARDING THE ACTUAL PLACEMENT RATES WE DO HAVE YOU KNOW SEVERAL SUCCESS STORIES OF COURSE NUMBER OF. INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE ABLE TO LAND JOBS AND HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL POST INCARCERATION BECAUSE OF THIS PROGRAM. THE RECIDIVISM RATE IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE GENERAL RECIDIVISM RATE- FOR PARTICIPANTS IN CALCULATE PROGRAMS. AND SO IN THAT WAY IT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL BUT WE DIDN'T THE HELP YEAH IT DOES NOT TRACK THEM INTO VISUALS WERE WE COULD PROVIDE THAT SORT OF. DATA AS FAR AS SUCCESS THE PLACEMENT OF DATA AND TO IS NOT CLEAR THAT THIS IS I. C. WORKING AS A VOCATIONAL PROGRAM- AND GIVEN THE ALLEYWAYS. L. L. L. A COMMON TO BE A RACIAL DECREASE HOW DO WE JUSTIFY- THIS THIS RATIO DECREASES IT DOESN'T MAKE IT DOESN'T SEEM TO. HAS A LOT TO ME THAT WE NEED TO DECREASE RATIO BASED ON THE LACK OF DATA AND- NOW WE HAVE SO FAR. WE'VE SEEN YEAH WE DO REGULAR AUDITS THAT THEY JAPAN PROGRAM IN INSTITUTIONS AND THEY DO AN EXCELLENT JOB OF PROVIDING THE SERVICES OF CLEANING. INSTITUTIONS WHAT- CAL PA COULD DO A BETTER JOB OF IS THE MENTORING ASPECTS. OF HOPING THE CAR STRAIGHT INDIVIDUALS UNDERSTAND THE PROGRAM BETTER THE DAY ARE BETTER SUITED THEY DO RECEIVE A CERTIFICATE WHEN THEY BELIEVE THAT SUCH A IT'S A CERTIFICATE PROGRAM. THAT MEETS THE- STANDARDS OF THE AMERICAN HEALTHCARE SYSTEM HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION FOR CLEANING. AND CERTIFICATE PROGRAM- AND IN THAT WAY IT'S VERY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM BUT WE WOULD. WE THINK THAT WE CAN PROVIDE BETTER MENTORING AND TRAINING FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS. AS THE PROGRAM PROCEEDS THAT THERE IS LOWER THAN A FORTY TO ONE RATIO IF IT'S THAT TWENTY TO ONE RATIO THEY'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE. THAT TRAINING THAT FEEDBACK- THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE DUTIES. AND AS THEY GO FORWARD. BUT IF. AT THE ARE ARE SHOWING THAT THE CLEAN. IS ADEQUATE- AND IF THAT'S PART OF YOUR GOAL DO THEY NEED ADDITIONAL MENTORING. AND THEY'VE THAT MENTORING IS MEANT TO BE S. TOWARD A CAREER ONCE THEY LEAVE WE DON'T HAVE. THAT INFORMATION AVAILABLE- WHAT ARE THE GUARANTEES THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY GETTING AN ARM OUR MONEY'S WORTH HERE. THE SENTIMENT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- IN REVIEW OF THOSE. I'M COMPLIANCE MONITORING UNIT REPORTS- THAT THAT'S EASY AGE CS DOES- SO OVER CALCULATES CLEANING PROCESS EASE YOU'LL FIND THAT THEY'RE NOT PERFECT THEY ARE- DOING ADEQUATE CLEANING BUT THERE'S DEFINITELY AREAS WHERE PEOPLE CAN LEARN AND IMPROVE AND THAT'S PART OF WHAT THOSE SUPERVISORS COULD POTENTIALLY DO- IS GIVING. BETTER FEEDBACK THAT WHEN PEOPLE LEAVE THEY HAVE THE SKILLS NECESSARY TO EXCEL ON ALL THOSE COMPONENTS- ACROSS THE BOARD SO AND IT. THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT. I THINK MIGHT MAKE TO BE CLEAR MY CONCERN IS THAT IF THEY'RE NOT PLAGUE OF THEY'RE NOT GETTING JOBS IN THIS FIELD ONCE THEY LEAVE IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW WELL TRAINED THEY ARE- AND SO THE INVESTMENT SEEMS. IT IT IT'S IT SEEMS IT SEEMS THAT NECESSARY OF WE ALREADY HAVE ACT ADEQUATE- CLEANING GOING ON. THE ONE THING TO NOTE IS THAT- WHILE THEY DON'T HAVE A MECHANISM IN PLACE TO TRACK POST INCARCERATION APPOINTMENT THEY ARE- THERE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE EDT IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS WITH THE PRISON TO EMPLOYMENT INITIATIVE AND PART OF THAT IS TO PROVIDE EMPLOYMENT DATA- UPPER FORMALLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS AND- THERE ARE SOME BARRIERS TO TRACKING CITIZENS WHO ARE FORMERLY INCARCERATED THAT THIS GROUP IS DEFINITELY LOOKING INTO WAYS TO GET BETTER DATA ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS. AT WITHOUT AGAIN WITH THAT DATA OR FINDING A WAY TO GET THROUGH THOSE BARRIERS THAT THEN AND WE HAVE TO ASK THE QUESTION OF IS THIS SAVE OCCASIONAL PROGRAM. OR JUST A SERVICE FOR THE PRESENT AND BEING HONEST WITH YOURSELF ABOUT WHAT IT IS AND- YEAH CALLING A SPADE A SPADE. AND SO MAYBE WHEN YOU COME BACK TO US YOU COULD LOOK INTO HOW MIGHT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO BETTER TRACK THAT INFORMATION SO WELL MAYBE WILL BE A LITTLE BIT FAILURE AND SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR DOES ONE MORE THING THIS IS CYNTHIA FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCING. I JUST WANTED TO ALSO NOTE THAT- TELL ME I HAVE HAD DIFFICULTY. RETAINING STAFF AND CUSTODIANS AND IT. THERE IS A LOT MORE CONSTANT CHURN AND HAVING EFFECTIVE SUPERVISION CAN HELP REMEDIATE THAT- AS WELL AS THE FACT THAT I LOWER SUPERVISION RATE IS CONSISTENT WITH HOW HR GUIDANCE. THIS IS ORLANDO SANCHEZ WITH THE- L. A. L. IN REGARDS TO- BEING- THE SUPERVISOR RATIO BEING- FOLLOWING A COMPLIANCE WITH KELLY CHARLIE ACTUALLY FOLLOWED UP WITH KELLY CHARTER AND- THIS IS RATIO THAT CALIFORNIA A HOPES TO ADDRESS IS ACTUALLY AN EXPIRED RATIO ALSO- THAT'S ONE THING WE FOLLOWED UP WITH A CHARM WERE ABLE TO GET A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION ON THAT- IN THAT REGARD CALCULATE DOES NOT HAVE TO FOLLOW THAT GUIDELINE. OKAY. WE JUST TO REITERATE WE HAVE A LOT OF THE SAME CONCERNS THAT THE ALLEY- BROUGHT UP ON THIS RACIAL- INVESTMENTS- AS WELL AND SO AS AS WE MOVE FORWARD JUSTIN COURAGE- THE DEPARTMENT TO RETHINK THAT REQUEST OR THINK OF THERE'S OTHER WAYS. TO HELP RETAIN STAFF FOR OTHER WAYS TO IMPROVE IN THOSE AREAS. OUR WHERE WE WILL PASS ADEQUATE TO A MUCH BETTER JOB IN CLEANLINESS OUT THERE- IF THERE ARE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM MY COLLEAGUES WILL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT THE PANEL WHICH IS THE REDUCTION WORKLOAD. THIS IS NOT A ONE CLEANED UP YOU DEBORAH KERR OFFICE OF FISCAL SERVICES FOR CDC ARE- WE'RE REQUESTING RESOURCES FOR PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. UNIT TO ADDRESS CHIARI WORKLOAD WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE AS A RESULT OF STATUTORY AND OPERATIONAL CHANGES. IN SUMMARY THE DEPARTMENT IS REQUESTING THE NINETEENTH POSITION TO SUPPORT THE DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS ARE UNIT AT SEVEN POINT SIX OPPOSITION TO SUPPORT THE OFFICE OF LEGAL AFFAIRS. RESOURCES REQUESTED FOR OFFICE OF LEGAL AFFAIRS WILL BE UTILIZED TO RESPOND ALL PR REYES ASSOCIATE IT WITH. OF THE FOUR CATEGORIES ARE TRIGGERING EVENTS THAT WERE ADDED TO PENAL CODE SECTION EIGHT THIRTY TWO POINT SEVEN. YEAH YOU YOU WHICH INCLUDE ITEMS SUCH AS ROCKING A REASONABLE OR EXCESSIVE FORCE OR UNLAWFUL ARREST RESEARCH. DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS HANDLE ALL KYARI OTHER PR A WORKLOAD ONE TWENTY FROM ANY PERSON WHO HAS THE RIGHT TO INSPECT- REQUEST AND RECEIVE COPIES OF PUBLIC RECORDS. OTHER ARE NOT EXEMPT. FROM PUBLIC DISCLOSURE. I REQUEST SOME ALMOST IN THE YEAR AND ARE HAS A TWO BASIC YOU TO INCREASE. PRIOR TO ONE TO TWO THE DEPARTMENT DID NOT AN ESTABLISHED UNIT OR THAT OF THE- TO HAVE ALL P. R. A. RIVER. ANY IN PART ONE TO TWO BUDGET CYCLE RECEIVE SEVEN POSITION TO LOOK ADDRESS DOCUMENT PRODUCTION WORKLOAD. AND WORKLOAD IDENTIFIED WITH BEFORE TWENTY ONE. BUT THIS REQUEST WILL PROVIDE RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THE ON GOING INCREASED WORKLOAD- IF YOU ARE A REQUEST FOR ALL. OTHER APPLICABLE PUBLIC RECORDS AND SB SIXTEEN WORKLOAD RELATED TO YOU AT THE INTERNATIONAL CATEGORIES IDENTIFIED. IN PENAL CODE EIGHT THIRTY TWO POINT SEVEN. IT WENT ON YOU KNOW WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. ACROSS FOR PROPOSALS- THE DEPARTMENT IS REQUESTING A TOTAL OF TWENTY ONE POINT SIX NEW POSITIONS AND TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION GENERAL FUND ONGOING AS WELL AS READ REDIRECTION OF FVE EXISTING POSITIONS AND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE THOUSAND. TO SUPPORT THAT AND- THE EXISTING AND NEW REDACTION WORKLOAD THAT WAS JUST DESCRIBED. WE FIND THAT THE LEVEL OF RESOURCES REQUESTED APPEARS REASONABLE IN THE NEAR TERM HOWEVER THE DEPARTMENT INDICATES THAT IT'S- IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING NEW- SOFTWARE THAT IT EXPECTS TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE- EFFICIENCY AT WITH WHICH STAFF ARE ABLE TO PERFORM REDAKTION WORKLOAD. SO IT'S UNCLEAR CDCR WILL NEED BEES THIS LEVEL OF RESOURCES IN THE FUTURE AFTER THAT SOFTWARE IS FULLY IMPLEMENTED. SO WE RECOMMEND TAT THE LEGISLATURE- APPROVED THE PROPOSED POSITIONS AND FUNDING ON A TWO YEAR LIMITED TERM BASIS. RATHER THAN ON AN ONGOING BASIS AS IS PROPOSED- AND THEN AFTER CDCR HAS FULLY IMPLEMENTED A NEW SOFTWARE AND HAS A BETTER SENSE OF THE ON GOING WORKLOAD. IT CAN'T COME FORWARD WITH A- A REQUEST FOR ONGOING RESOURCES AS PART OF THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE BUDGET PROCESS. AND I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THIS APPROACH OF. PROVIDING LIMITED TERM POSITIONS IN AREAS WHERE THERE IS- LACK OF CLARITY ON THE ON GOING NEED IS NOT. UNUSUAL SOMETHING THAT APARTMENT IS ACTUALLY. PROPOSING TO DO IN A FEW CASES. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE ADMINISTRATION UNDERSCORES THE IMPORTANCE OF THE VARIOUS REQUESTS FOR THESE PERMANENT I'M GOING RESOURCES FOR REDUCTION AS THE DEPARTMENT IS CURRENTLY STRUGGLING TO MEET THE WORKLOAD DEMANDS ASSOCIATED WITH PARAQUAT REQUESTS AND THE SOFTWARE THAT THE ONLY- MENTIONS ME OUR LEAD TO SOME EFFICIENCIES AND CERTAIN WORKLOAD FUNCTIONS BUT IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY IMPACTS THE CORE WORKLOAD THAT'S REQUIRED WHICH RELATES TO THE ACTUAL MANUAL REDUCTION OF THE FOOTAGE WHICH CAN TAKE TEN MINUTES TO REDACT ONE MINUTE OF AUDIO FOOTAGE AND TWENTY MINUTES STRAIGHT DOC ONE MINUTE OF VIDEO FOOTAGE ON AVERAGE. AND SO AND THEN THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WORKLOAD THAT I THE SOFTWARE ISN'T LIKELY TO IMPACT WHICH HAS TO DO WITH RESEARCH CASE PREPARATION TRACKING CORRESPONDENTS IN REPORTING I TO THE OVERALL VOLUME OF WORKLOAD IS SIGNIFICANT IN THE ADMINISTRATION FEELS THIS IS A FAIRLY CONSERVATIVE STARTING POINT- AND THE VOLUME OF WORKLOAD IS LIKELY TO OFFSET ANY EFFICIENCIES THAT ARE GAINED THROUGH THE REDUCTION SOFTWARE WITH THAT AD BILLABLE. THE ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU- OKAY ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME IN THIS PANEL FONG REMOVE THIS ON TO THE NEXT- ISSUE NUMBER FIVE. DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE REALIGNMENT. AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY AME IS DR HEATHER FULTON AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE CURRENTLY DJJ PREPARING FOR THE CLOSURE IN RESPONSE TO S. B. EIGHT TWENTY THREE BUT I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR OUR FOCUS. WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE CONTINUITY OF ALL SERVICES AND PROGRAMS OF IN A SAFE AND REHABILITATIVE MATTER FOR ALL THE GUITAR CARE CURRENTLY WE HAVE A POPULATION OF SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY YOUTH AND WE EXPECT THE POPULATION TO BEGIN REDUCING AND FUTURE MONTHS. DJJ IS FOCUSED ON PROVIDING MEANINGFUL AND TAILORED REHABILITATIVE SERVICES FOR EVERY YOUTH AND DJJ UNTIL WE CLOSE THE NEEDS OF DJJ YOUTH ARE SIGNIFICANT AND COMPLEX WHICH IS WHY MEASURED APPROACH IS IMPORTANT WHEN MAKING DECISIONS REGARDING HOW YOU THREE CHANCES THAT COUNTIES BOTH ACTIVELY DOWNSIZING THE SYSTEM. THE MANNER IN WHICH THE TRANSITION OF CARE IS COORDINATED IT'S CRITICAL THE TRANSFER CARE REQUIRES A ONE SIZE FITS ONE MODEL AS WE KNOW EACH THAT YOU CHOOSE IS UNIQUE AND EACH OUNTY IS UNIQUE. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO AND BEING GAUGED WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING YOUTH AND THEIR FAMILIES. IN TRANSITION PLANNING. AND TELL THEIR TRANSIT CARE. A CENTRAL COMPONENT TRANSITION PLANNING THANK ADDRESSING NEED SUCH AS MENTAL HEALTH I'M GOING MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS CONTINUED POSITIVE EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT EMPLOYMENT AND OTHER OUTCOMES RELATED TO AVOIDING RECIDIVISM. THANK GOODNESS PROVISION IN THIS CASE PLANNING FOR EACH YOUTH IS A KEY COMPONENT TO THE TRANSITION OF CARE SO THAT THEIR STAFF ARE AWARE OF THE USED STRENGTH THEIR NEEDS BUT SERVICES THAT YOU'VE RECEIVED BOND DJJ ADDITIONAL TREATMENT MEANS RECOMMENDED AN EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT. IT ALSO ALLOWS FOR COLLABORATION AND FURTHER CONVERSATIONS FOR CREATING THE BEST PLAN TO MOVE TO LOCAL CARE AND SUCCESSFULLY SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATING. THE YOUTH INTO THEIR NEW TREATMENTS CITING. THE CHALLENGES FACE THE ARE OVER NEXT MONTHS SIXTEEN ONE ARE REAL BEEN HARD ON BOTH USE STOP FOR MULTIPLE REASONS WE'VE HAD TO ASK FOR PATIENCE AND FLEXIBILITY. A LOT TO ASK OF ANYONE IT'S REALLY A LOT TO ASK OF YOU WHO ARE STILL LEARNING HOW TO COPE WITH. DIFFICULT EMOTIONS AND CERTAINTY AND CHANGE. ONE OF OUR PRIMARY CHALLENGES TO AND THE RETENTION OF STAFF WHO UNDERSTANDABLY HAVE BEEN SEEKING EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES JOB STABILITY FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES. RECOGNIZING THE NEED TO RETAIN AND RECRUIT VALUABLE VALUABLE STAFF TO DJJ DEMONSTRATION OF PROPOSED OPTIONS FOR STAFF TO HAVE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES PRIOR TO THE CLOSURE AND INCENTIVES TO STAY UNTIL THE CLOSURE ON LEASE. DJS CORE MISSION IS REHABILITATION. THIS IS WHY THESE ACTORS ARE VITAL TO COMPUTING. FORGET THAT ENABLE TO PROVIDE THE QUALITY EDUCATION AND TREATMENT FOR YOU UNTIL THE VERY LAST DAY. IN TERMS OF COBIT WE CONTINUE TO BE DEVOTED AND TO THE CARE OF OUR USE AND IT HAS BEEN OUR TOP PRIORITY FOR THEIR SAFETY AND OUR STAFF IF E. SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC. AS OF TODAY WE HAVE NO ACTIVE CASES WITH ANY OF OUR FACILITIES. LIKE MANY WE ARE ANXIOUS TO RETURN TO SOME SENSE OF NORMALITY AND WE RE IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING A ROAD MAP-TO RE OPENING. WELL WE WILL NEED TO CONTINUE TO BE VIGILANT AS WE NAVIGATE THESE NEXT SIXTEEN MONTHS AND BE READY TO MAKE CHANGES AS NEEDED TO KEEP EVERYONE SAFE. THANK YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. I THINK YOU A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NO SPECIFIC QUESTION DOES HE KNOW SPECIFIC COMMENTS BUT AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU- FOR DOCTOR BOTH- HAVE YOU BEEN RECALLED BY THE COUNTY SINCERE LACK REALIGNMENT WITH THE ANNOUNCED AND DO WE KNOW WHERE THE STUDENTS WERE EVENTUALLY PLACED. I AM WE HAVE HAD STANDS AT. TWENTY TWENTY WE HAVE HAD NINETY TWO CASES THAT WERE A PETITION WAS PUT INTO THE PORT FOR THEM TO BE RECALLED TWENTY THREE OF THOSE WRE GRANTED I BELIEVE IN THE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE LARGE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE CASES AND THEY WERE- NOT NECESSARILY ALL DUE TO CLOSURE. SEVERAL OF THEM WERE BUT ENSURING KOPEN- BUT MY UNDERSTANDING WITH THE VAST MAJORITY IS THEY WORK GRANTED AT LEAST. CAME ANY QUESTIONS THE SYSTEM CORRECT THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER SIX. I WANT TO PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW YOU HAVEN'T REALLY HELPFUL SUMMARY IN YOUR AGENDA- AND THIS PROPOSAL IS FOR ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR JUVENILE FACILITY IMPROVEMENTS. TO RESPOND TO THE CURRENT AND PRESSING NEEDS THAT COUNTIES ARE FACING TO MODERNIZE AND UPDATE THEIR FACILITIES TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN MEETING THE GOALS OF DJJ REALIGNMENT WHICH DOCTOR PULLS HIS JUSTIN SPEAKING ABOUT- THE KEY. THANK YOU AND REALLY SIGNIFICANT POLICY GOALS ARE IN THIS PROGRAMMATIC CHIPS INCLUDE ENSURING THAT THERE IS PROGRAMMING AND TREATMENT TO SUPPORT POSITIVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT- ARMED SERVICES IN COUNTY FACILITIES NEED TO BE DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE TRAUMA INFORMED. AND IN AS MANY CASES AS POSSIBLE KEEP YOUNG PEOPLE CLOSER TO HOME. CALLIE'S MONEY BE SURE THAT THEY'RE ABLE. TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A- WITH ALL THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED PROGRAMMING AT THE APPROPRIATE LEVELS AND I THINK EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITIES THAT EXIST THAT IF IT COUNTY WHETHER THAT'S A DISTRICT ATTORNEY OR JUDGE RECREATION APARTMENT. DOESN'T FEEL LIKE THEY'RE PREPARED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF A PARTICULAR YOUNG PERSON THAT THERE'S AN INCREASED RISK THAT THAT YOUNG PERSON WILL BE TRANSFERRED INTO THE ADULT. REMOTE SYSTEM AND SO WE WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE COUNTIES HAVE BEEN MOVING VERY VERY QUICKLY SINCE SB EIGHT TWENTY THREE PASSED AND THEY NEED TO BE READY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO MEET THE NEEDS THE NEEDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE. WILL BE COMING INTO THE ACCOUNTING SYSTEM AS YOU KNOW JOHNNY SUBMITTED THEIR SB TWENTY THREE IMPLEMENTATION PLANS- IN THE OFFICE THE VIEWS AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION IS CONDUCTING A ROBUST REVIEW. OF THOSE COUNTY PLANS- I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK THROUGH SEVERAL OF THEM AND- THESE THEMES CONTINUE AGAIN AND AGAIN. YOU SEE- THAT THAT THE IDEAS. THE COUNTIES HAVE FOCUSED ON. BASEBALL OUR AND FACILITY THAT MIGHT. TO PROVIDE FROM WORK. A MORE HOME LIKE ENVIRONMENT- AND NUMEROUS OTHER THINGS CONSISTENT WITH THE GOALS OF THIS CHANGE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE AND THERE'S QUITE A BIT THAT'S BEEN RAISED BY THE L. A. R. O. AND SOME IN YOUR ANALYSIS AS WELL. THIS IS NOT INTENDED TO INCREASE CAPACITY IT'S INSTEAD TO IMPROVE OF WHAT THE HOW THE FACILITIES- ARE ABLE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF YOUTH COMING THEIR WAY- I KNOW THAT WE- HAVE BEEN AT THIS HEARING FOR QUITE A WHILE SO I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO. STOP THERE AND SEE WHAT QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. AND THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED COUNTY OPERATED JUVENILE FACILITY GRANTS PROGRAM. BECAUSE THE ADMINISTRATION DID NOT PRODUCT PROVIDE SUFFICIENT INFORMATION. ON HOW IT ARRIVED AT THE A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND IT IS NOT CLEAR WHY ADDITIONAL FUNDING IS NECESSARY. WE WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT A FEW THINGS THAT WENT TO THIS RECOMMENDATION BASED ON A THOROUGH ASSESSMENT OF COUNTY FACILITY NEEDS. WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION DID CONDUCT A SURVEY TO DETERMINE WHETHER COUNTIES WOULD BE INTERESTED IN RECEIVING MORE FUNDS. NO ASSESSMENT HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC DEFICIENCIES. OR SHOW THE EXTENT TO WHICH EXISTING COUNTY FACILITIES ARE IN NEED OF REPAIR pOR NOT ADEQUATE TO PROVIDE. THE REHAB SERVICES TO RE ALIGNED YOUTH. THIS MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO EVALUATE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE PROPOSED A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. IN ADDITION WHEN CONSIDERING WHETHER COUNTIES ARE IN NEED OF THIS FUNDING OF THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER TWO THINGS. THE FIRST IS THAT IN RECENT YEARS. THE LEGISLATURE HAS PROVIDED THREE HUNDRED MILLION FOR IT JOVENEL COUNTY FACILITIES THAT HAVE LED TO NEWLY CONSTRUCTED AT SPACE. AND REPAIRS THAT ARE ARE ONLY RECENTLY COMING ONLINE IS NEWLY CONSTRUCTED SPACES MAY BE IN BETTER CONDITION. AND MORE CONDUCIVE TO RE HAVE PROGRAMMING HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONTRACT WITH EACH OTHER FOR ADDITIONAL SPACE. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOME COUNTIES MAY HAVE FACILITY NEEDS SUCH COUNTIES CAN CONTRACT WITH OTHERS TO HOUSE HE'S RELYING TWO YEARS. AND IN FACT THE SURVEY BY THE SEC FOLLOWING REAIGN THEM AND FOUND THAT SEVERAL COUNTIES WOULD BE WILLING TO TAKE ON. REALIGNED YEARS FROM OTHER COUNTIES. FOR THESE REASONS WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. IF IN THE FUTURE THE ADMINISTRATION IS ABLE TO PROVIDE A DETAILED ASSESSMENT OF COUNTY JUVENILE FACILITY NEEDS. THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THESE NEWLY CONSTRUCTED BED SPACES AND THE INABILITY OF COUNTIES TO PARTNER AMONGST EACH OTHER AND THEN THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER PROVIDING FACILITY GRANTS TO THOSE COUNTIES AT THAT TIME. AND THE LAST POINT WE'D LIKE TO MAKE. IS THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS EXCLUDABLE UNDER THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT. AS A REMINDER TO THE LEGISLATURE THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION IMPOSES A LIMIT ON THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE THE STATE CAN APPROPRIATE EACH YEAR. OFTEN CALLED THE CELL. THE STATE CAN EXCLUDE CERTAIN APPROPRIATIONS FROM THE SOUTH CALCULATION SUGGESTS BENDING ON CAPITAL OUTLAY WHICH THIS PROPOSAL WOULD FALL UNDER. AS SUCH IF THE LEGISLATURE REJECTS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ITWOULD NEED TO REPURPOSE THE ASSOCIATE FUNDING FOR OTHER SOLID EXCLUDABLE PURPOSES. THANK YOU AND HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. I THINK YOU IT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WITH THE CLOSURE DJJ ON JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY THREE COUNTIES WILL ASSUME THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR SERVING ALL JUSTICE INVOLVED YOUTH. TO THE YOUTH ACROSS THE JUVENILE JUSTICE CONTINUUM THIS INCLUDES YOUTH THAT WILL HAVE A GREATER REHABILITATIVE NEEDS AND GENERALLY REQUIRE A HIGHER LEVEL OF SERVICE. THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING FUNDS BASED ON LOCAL NEEDS WITH THE GOAL OF THE FIFTEEN COUNTIES IN PROVIDING SPACES THAT WILL SUPPORT TREATMENT AND REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING FOR THE RELATING TO YOU THAT THEY WILL THEY ARE NOW AND WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SERVING UNDER SB EIGHT TO THREE IN SB NINETY TWO. AND I'D BE A CITY CAN SHARE THIS ADDITIONALLY IT WAS EVIDENT THROUGH THE GRANT ADMINISTRATION PROCESS FOR THE SB EIGHTY THREE YOUTH PROGRAMS AND FACILITIES GRANT PROGRAM AND WE UNDERSTAND MANY OF THE COUNTY PLANS REQUIRED UNDER SB EIGHT TO THREE. INCLUDE REFERENCES TO FACILITY RELATED NEEDS PARTICULARLY AS IT COULD TAKE PERTAINS TO CREATING A MORE THERAPEUTIC AND HOME LIKE ENVIRONMENTS. THE ADMINISTRATION IS SEEKING IS THAT COMING UP TO BE AS SUCCESSFUL AS POSSIBLE AND SERVING THE REALIGN POPULATION AND HAS IDENTIFIED A HUNDRED MILLION AS A REASONABLE AMOUNT TO PERFORM FACILITY MODIFICATIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS. TO PROVIDE THERAPEUTIC AND YOU CENTER TREATMENT AND REHABILITATIVE STATE AND ENVIRONMENTS. AND ADDITIONALLY DID YOU SCHEDULED TO CLOSE IN JUST SEVENTEEN MONTHS THE ADMINISTRATION IS SEEKING TO PROVIDE FUNDS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO ENABLE COUNTIES TO UNDERTAKE AS MUCH PLANNING AND PROJECT WORK PRIOR TO DJS CLOSER AS POSSIBLE. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE WITHOUT HAPPY. TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU. MR GOOSE MON ARE YOU AVAILABLE THANK YOU THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY- BUDGET COMMITTEE MY NAME IS FRANKIE WAS MINE I'M AN ATTORNEY AT THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR YOUTH LAW OR  LEAD A TEAM OF ATTORNEYS POLICY A COMMUNITY ADVOCATES FOCUSED ON ADVANCING POLICIES AND INVESTMENTS PROVEN TO BE EFFECTIVE AT PROMOTING POSITIVE OUTCOMES FOR YOUTH INVOLVED IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND INCREASING COMMUNITY HEALTH AND SAFETY I ALSO SPENT SIX YEARS AS AN ADOLESCENT INCARCERATING COUNTY JUVENILE HALL AND STATE YOUTH PRISONS. I'M HERE TODAY TO VOICE MY STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO ALLOCATE ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF STATE FUNDS TO COUNTIES TO SUPPORT IMPROVEMENTS TO COUNTY OPERATED JUVENILE FACILITIES AT THE STATE PREPARES TO CLOSE DJJ I WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT MY POSITION I AGREE THE STATEMENT INVEST RESOURCES IN DEVELOPING LOCAL CAPACITY AND THE RIGHT INFRASTRUCTURE TO BETTER SERVE YOU HOWEVER A HASTY DECISION TO DUMP ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS INTO RENOVATING LOCAL YOUTH JAILS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO UNDERMINE THE HEALING BASED DIRECTION FOR YOUTH JUSTICE THAT WAS ENACTED A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO WITH SB EIGHT TWENTY THREE. WE ARE AT A CRITICAL MOMENT WHERE WE NEED TO PROCEED THOUGHTFULLY NOT JUST BECAUSE A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IS A LOT OF TAXPAYER MONEY BUT BECAUSE THE STATE MUST ENSURE THAT EACH STEP IT TAKES SUPPORT THE DIRECTION IT HAS CHOSEN AND DOES NOT UNDERMINE AND CAUSE HARM TO YOUNG PEOPLE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES THE PURPOSE OF SB TWENTY THREE WAS TO CLOSE CALIFORNIA'S PUNITIVE AND HARMFUL YOUTH PRISONS AND INSTEAD OF INVESTING LOCAL ALTERNATIVES THAT BETTER PROMOTE POSITIVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT AND REDUCE CRIME AND RECIDIVISM UTILIZING TRAUMA INFORMED CULTURALLY ROOTED AND DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE SERVICES FOR YOUTH IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT. UNFORTUNATELY MOST COUNTIES ARE MAKING PLANS FOR THE LONG TERM INCARCERATION OF YOUTH IN JUVENILE HALLS MAXIMUM SECURITY SHORT TERM DETENTION FACILITIES THAT ARE FAR MORE RESTRICTIVE PUNITIVE AND HARMFUL TO YOUNG PEOPLE THAN WHAT DJJ OFFERS NOW THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED ALLOCATED ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN STATE FUNDS TO SUPPORT IMPROVEMENTS TO PUNITIVE AND HARMFUL YOU DETENTION FACILITIES WITH. NO JUSTIFICATION FOR THE AMOUNT PROPOSED OR FORT PROPOSED FOR. WEALTHY AGAIN THE ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS. IS ARBITRARY AND WOULD DO LITTLE TO MAKE ANY JUVENILE HALL SUITABLE FOR POSITIVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT AND THE ENTIRE STATE. HOWEVER A HUNDRED MILLION A ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR STATE INVESTMENT TO LOCAL JUVENILE FACILITIES WOULD LOCK US INTO OVER PROGRESSIVE APPROACH. TO SERVING YOU. ONE THAT IS RELIANT ON PUNITIVE CORRECTIONAL MODELS AT ODDS WITH SB TWENTY THREES INTENT. OF DEVELOPING LOCAL TRAUMA INFORMED CULTURALLY ROOTED AND DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE TREATMENT FOR YOUTH IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE APPROPRIATE SETTINGS. THE LEGISLATURE MEANS EJECT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AS IS. AND INSTEAD INVEST THE STATE'S RESOURCES INTO RESEARCHING  DEVELOPMENTAL AND REHABILITATIVE NEEDS OF DJJ ELIGIBLE YOUTH. AND THE NEEDS OF COUNTIES TO IMPROVE INDIVIDUAL YOUTH OUTCOMES AND COMMUNITY HEALTH AND SAFETY. AT LET'S TAKE A MOMENT TO DO THIS RIGHT BECAUSE THE DECISION THAT WE MAKE IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS. WILL HAVE A FAR REACHING IMPACT FOR YEARS AND DECADES TO COME. THE STATE COULD TASK THE OFFICE OF YOU CAN COMMITTEE RESTORATION TO SURVEY THE FIELD. RESEARCH BEST PRACTICES ENVIRONMENTS FOR YOUTH DEVELOPMENT. AND DEVELOP SHORT AND LONG TERM SOLUTIONS FOR PROGRAMMING AND SPACE NEEDS. WITH THIS INFORMATION THE STATE CAN RESPONSIBLY AND EFFECTIVELY INVEST ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE. IN NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET. SESSION TO IMPROVE YOURSELF COMES. OR BLACK BROWN AND INDIGENOUS WITH HISTORIES OF ABUSE NEGLECT POVERTY AND OTHER DISADVANTAGES. TO DO OTHERWISE WOULD RISK HARMING VULNERABLE YOU FOR GENERATIONS INCREASING TRANSFERS TO THE ADULT SYSTEM WASTING STATE TAX DOLLARS ANY ROAD IN THE PUBLIC'S TRUST AND WELL INTENTIONED YOUTH JUSTICE REFORMS. I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO NOTE CALIFORNIA'S PLAN TO CLOSE THE JJ BEGAN WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DRIVEN BY BUDGETARY CONCERNS. AND A RECOGNITION THAT ARE OUTDATED HARMFUL YOU CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM WAS NO LONGER ACCEPTABLE. BUT HERE WE ARE TODAY ENTERTAINING PROPOSAL FROM THE SAME GOVERNOR THAT WOULD INVESTIGATE IF IT CAN STATE RESOURCES IN OUTDATED HARMFUL YOUTH CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES. WITH LITTLE CONCERN FOR COST TO OUR STATE AND IT'S MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PAY A NEW COURSE FOR YOUTH JUSTICE. A MODEL SYSTEM THAT IS ROOTED IN DATA AND RESEARCH AND GIVE MEANING TO SB TWENTY THREE VERSION OF HEALTH CENTER. RACIALLY JUST SYSTEM THAT HONORS THE TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL OF ALL YOUTH LIKE MYSELF. HOWEVER THAT WOULD REQUIRE US TO LEARN FROM OUR MISTAKES AND NOT CONTINUE TO MAKE HASTY DECISIONS AND POOR INVESTMENTS IN CONCRETE CELL BLOCKS STEEL DOORS. AND BARBED WIRE FENCES WITH NO ACCOUNTABILITY FOR HOW COUNTY USE PUBLIC RESOURCES. AND HOW WE TREAT OUR MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN WE KNOW BETTER AND WE HAVE THE TIME AND RESOURCES TO DO BETTER. LET'S SLOW THINGS DOWN COME UP WITH A THOUGHTFUL PLAN OPTIONS AND INVEST IN THE HEALTH AND PROSPERITY. OF ALL CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT- FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF. FINANCE- WANT TO READ YOU A PIECE OF THE GOVERNOR'S DJ REALIGNMENT WHICH INCLUDED THE PROVISION THAT SAID. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION FOR COUNTIES TO USE EVIDENCE BASED AND PROMISING PRACTICES THE PROGRAMS THAT IMPROVE THE OUTCOMES OF YOUTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY REDUCE THE TRANSFER OF YOUTH INTO THE ADULT CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. ENSURE THAT THIS POSITIONS ARE IN THE LEAST ETHNIC- IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE OPERATIVE ENVIRONMENT REDUCE AND THEN ELIMINATE RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES AND REDUCE THE USE OF CONFINEMENT IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM BY UTILIZING COMMUNITY BASS RESPONSE AND INTERVENTIONS. CAN YOU SPEAK TO HOW THIS PROPOSAL I HEAR THROUGH THE STATUTORY PROVISION. I'M SURE THIS IS A HARD WITH THE BSE THEME MAY I RESPOND. YES OR HER. ARM THE PROPOSAL I'M GONNA ASK YOU TO SPEAK UP A LITTLE BIT. OH SURE LET ME CHECK MY MICROPHONE HERE. IS THAT BETTER YES OKAY THANKS- SO I THINK THAT THE CONCERNS THAT- MISTER BECAUSE MINE HAS OUTLINED ARE ONES THAT ARE SHARED BY THE ADMINISTRATION BY THE SPCA AND BY COUNTIES AND WHILE CERTAINLY- THERE ARE ARE DIFFERING VIEWS I THINK IF WE WERE TO REVIEW TOGETHER THE COUNTY PLANS THAT HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SB EIGHT TWENTY THREE- THEY ARE FULL OF EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES AND AN EVIDENCE BASED AND PROMISING PRACTICES. ARE HUGE CONCERN AND I THINK WHY THERE'S A CERTAIN- URGENCY IN THE TIME HERE IS THE SECOND ITEM THAT YOU NOTED THE OUR SHARED GOAL TO REDUCE TRANSFERS TO ADULT COURT. ON LET'S KEEP IN MIND THIS REALLY IS A COMP. ARENA WHERE'S WHERE A LOT OF DIFFERENT SERVICES NEED TO BE DELIVERED AND THERE IS A CONTINUUM OF CARE THERE'S ALSO YOU KNOW WHAT TIME FRAME FOR YOUNG PEOPLE- MIGHT INITIALLY BE HOUSED IN A MORE RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT WHILE. PROGRAMMING AND TREATMENT AND REHABILITATIVE SERVICES ARE BEING DELIVERED- OF THOSE. PROGRAMMING AND REHABILITATIVE SERVICES ARE- GOING TO IN. A NUMBER OF INSTANCES NEED TO BE PROVIDED AT A COUNTY DETENTION FACILITY AND IT IS EXACTLY THE CONCERNS THAT FRIEND HE WAS MY OUTLINED ABOUT WANTING TO CHANGE ON THE PHYSICAL PLANT THE FEEL AND- THE ABILITY FOR THERE TO BE A MORE HOME LIKE ENVIRONMENT BETTER CLASSROOMS AND SOMEONE- THERE IS ALSO A CONTINUUM OF. CARE AND CAN AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS WILL ABSOLUTELY BE INVOLVED IN SB EIGHT TWENTY THREE AS IT IS IMPLEMENTED SO IT'S- KIND OF YOU KNOW NOT ALL- THE SERVICES ARE NOT ALL GOING TO BE DELIVERED IN IN DETENTION FACILITIES AT THE COUNTY LEVEL THERE'S A WHOLE RANGE OF NEEDS. OUT THERE AND WHILE I KNOW ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS CERTAINLY IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO GO INTO THIS WE ALSO KNOW THAT FACILITY MODIFICATIONS TEND TO ADD UP REALLY REALLY QUICKLY AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THINGS LIKE- ADDING CLASSROOMS AND CHAINING CHANGING FURNITURE- EVEN IN SOME CASES LIKE THOSE WHO ARE HERE FROM LOS ANGELES COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY WERE TO DECIDE TO. ADD CLIMBING IN- THE ROOMS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND THOSE JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITIES WHICH PRESENTLY DON'T HAVE TOILETS AND SINKS THOSE KINDS OF COSTS THAT UP REALLY REALLY QUICKLY SO I WOULD JUST AGREE THAT IT'S A LOT OF MONEY AND I WOULD ALSO STATE THAT THE NEEDS ARE VERY HIGH. SO YES THE POLICY HOLDERS ARE CLEARLY IN THEIR REDUCING TRANSFERS TO ADULT COURTS ARE USING THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT ADDRESSING THE REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUES OF REDUCING RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES BUT THERE ALSO NEEDS TO BE A SERVICES AVAILABLE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE ACROSS THE CONTINUUM OF CARE AND THIS IS JUST ONE PART. OF THE CONTINUUM OF CARE. SO THIS IS JUST ONE PART OF THE CONTINUING OKAY MAYBE THAT GOES INTO. IN GENERAL MY CONCERNED WITH THIS PROPOSAL AND WHY ABOUT THAT PIECE OF. IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT WE HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN- AND THAT WE'RE MOVING IN THAT ALL THE COUNTIES ARE MOVING IN THE SAME DIRECTION IT'S NOT FAIR THAT WERE HELPING THE COUNTIES MOVE IN THE SAME DIRECTION THAT WE'RE HOLDING THEM ACCOUNTABLE ALSO YOU MENTIONED THAT SOME COUNTIES HAVE COMMITTED PLANTS BUT NOT ALL HAVE. SO HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THIS IS AN EQUITABLE PROCESSES FOR ALL ND NOT JUST FOR SOME OUT THERE- AND THE REALITY IS THAT. MAYBE MORE THAN A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IS NEEDED AT THE END OF THE DAY I AND THAT'S A REALITY THAT WE NEED TO FACE AND BE READY FOR BUT HAVING A CARE PLAN THAT THAT IS COMPREHENSIVE IS IMPORTANT AND IT IT. IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE. WE'RE WE'RE MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION I FEEL THAT WITH THAT I MONEY. TOWARD SOMETHING THAT MAYBE IS GOING TO REPEAT A LOT OF WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE. WELL I PUBLIC THINGS IN RESPONSE THAT I'M SORRY IF I GAVE YOU THE IMPRESSION THAT NOT ALL COUNTY SUBMITTED PLANS THEY ABSOLUTELY DID. I JUST REFERENCE THAT I'VE REVIEWED SEVERAL AND NOT ALL ON BUT ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES DID SUBMIT THEIR IMPLEMENTATION PLAN TO THE OFFICE OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION. AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT A Y. C. R. WILL BE MEETING WITH EACH AND EVERY COUNTY TO REVIEW THOSE PLANS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND- WHAT THEY HAVE IN MIND AND DID BEGIN THIS I THINK. REALLY IMPORTANT PRACTICE OF ENSURING THAT- THAT COUNTIES HAVE ACCESS TO OUR ADVICE ON BEST PRACTICES TRAUMA INFORMED APPROACHES AND SO ON AND SO FORTH- I GUESS IT WOULD BE. YOU KNOW CERTAINLY POSSIBLE THAT WE COULD ALL COME TO AGREEMENT THAT. A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR COUNTY FACILITY NEEDS ISN'T SUFFICIENT BUT- I'M JUST MOST CONCERNED ABOUT THE- URGENT NEED TO MAKE SOME OF THESE IMPROVEMENTS. SO THAT YOUNG PEOPLE WHO- ARE CAN BE APPROPRIATELY PLACED IN THE COUNTY JUVENILE FACILITY THAT THAT OPTION EXISTS AND THAT JUDGES AND DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND PROBATION DEPARTMENTS- ARE ABLE TO HAVE THAT OPTION. AS OPPOSED TO INCREASING TRANSFERS TO ADULT COURT. BOB THIS IS VERY MUCH YOU KNOW INSTEAD OF BEING MAJOR IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES THAT ARE ALL IN FLUX. AND THE FACILITY NEEDS HAVE EMERGED AS ONE OF THE. MORE TIME SENSITIVE ONES. IT'S INTERESTING THAT THE MERCH AS TIME SENSITIVE ONE WHEN. THE INITIAL NEGOTIATIONS- DID NOT INCLUDE. INFRASTRUCTURE RESOURCES BECAUSE THERE WASN'T THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH DATA- THAN. I IN THE PLANS THAT THE COUNTY SOMETHING ADDED I DON'T THINK HAVE. DO MUCH. WITH THE FACILITIES EITHER. AND SO I JUST WORRY THAT SEVENTEEN MONTHS WILL BE HERE QUICK- I UNDERSTAND THE SHORT WINDOW OF TIME AND I UNDERSTAND THE GRAVITY IN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME THAT WE ARE PRIORITIZING THE ACTUAL WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE VERSUS. TO SAYING WE DID SOMETHING. I AND SO LET'S DO THIS- AND SO THAT'S THAT'S MY CONCERN THERE. I DON'T KNOW YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT- WELL I MEAN I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH YOU THAT THAT THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPETING PRIORITIES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED TO ENSURE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS AND- HE FOR THIS CONVERSATION TODAY ON WATER THAT DEFICIENCIES IN FACILITIES AND IT IS SOME OF WHAT FRANKIE WAS MINE MENTIONED YOU KNOW A MORE RESTRICTIVE AND- JAIL LIKE ENVIRONMENT FOR YOUTH WILL WHERE POSSIBLE BUT THE GOLAN THE HOPE IS TO STOP IN THOSE ENVIRONMENTS MAKE THEM MORE HOME LIKE- AND ALSO PAY ATTENTION TO THE OVER ARCHING POLICY GOAL OF. LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT- BUT I THINK IT'S JUST IMPORTANT KEEP IN MIND THAT YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE A VARIETY OF PROGRAMMING AND TREATMENT AND REHABILITATIVE NEEDS THAT THAT HAVE TO BE BACK PART OF YOUR STATEMENT I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT THIS HUNDRED MILLION IN INFRASTRUCTURE. IS ADDRESSING THAT LAST PART OF YOUR STATEMENT I THINK WE DO SHARE THE COMMON GOAL I THINK IT'S THE QUESTION IS ARE WE INVEST IN A WAY THAT GETS US TO THAT COMMON GOAL AND I'M NOT CONVINCED OF THAT. AT AT THIS POINT. MR STILL. THANK YOU AND JUST TO REITERATE WITH THE CHAIRED SAID NGUYEN THE PROPOSAL FIRST CAME TO US THROUGH THERE WAS. IN THIS COMMITTEE A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR. REFORMING DJJ BUT I THINK SOME CONCERN ABOUT WHAT THE IMPLEMENTATION WAS THAT AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE HEARING. HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO ME LOOKING AT STATEWIDE NEEDS PROBABLY DOESN'T SOUND LIKE ENOUGH AND THIS IS JUST THE BUDGET WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BUDGETING MONEY SO WHAT THE ULTIMATELY IMPORTANT HERE. BEFORE THAT MONEY GETS SPENT IS UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS. AND LAST YEAR WE WENT AROUND AND AROUND WITH THE- I SEE ARE AND WHAT OUR EXPECTATION OF THEIR MISSION IS AND HOW THEY ARE GOING TO FUNCTION. WITHIN THE STATE IN FACT WE WANTED TO SPEND MORE MONEY WITH THE YC R. THAN THAT HAD BEEN PROPOSED AND THE REASON IS. THAT IF THAT AGENCY IS NOT. IS NOT CREATED TO HAVE THE STRENGTH THE RESEARCH ABILITY THE ABILITY REALLY TO LAY OUT BEST PRACTICES AND- WHAT'S GOOD INCENTIVES ARE GOOD OPTIONS IN FRONT OF COUNTIES TO ENSURE THAT THOSE COUNTIES AND ARE ARE IMPLEMENTING THOSE THEN WE'RE JUST KIND OF PERPETUATING AT A LOCAL LEVEL WHAT HAD BEEN DEVELOPED AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL THAT'S NOT REALLY SERVING THE KIDS SO IT'S I THINK THE FRUSTRATION HERE. IS AROUND THE TIMING OF THE WAY THE PROCESS COMES TOGETHER THAT IF WE ARE JUST HAVING A PART OF MONEY IN THE DESIRING TO SPEND IT. THE OUTCOMES ARE UNCERTAIN. AND WE COULD HAVE CREATED SOMETHING HERE THAT WILL BE DETRIMENTAL TO OUR KIDS. IF THE IF PART OF THIS IS IT WILL I'M NOT SURE IT'S CLEAR FOR US THE ROLE OF- I SEE ARE THROUGH THIS PROCESS. AND THE GOAL WITH CREATING OVERSEE OUR WAS WAS FOR US SINCE WE WEREN'T NECESSARILY GOING TO BE THIS ABOUT A PROBLEM WITH REALIGNMENT ACROSS THE BOARD. MANDATING CERTAIN PROGRAMS WORK THAT SINCE WE'RE ALLOWING THE COUNTIES TO DO THE IMPLEMENTATION. WE THEN ARE INCENTIVIZING CAJOLING CREATING SOME. OPPORTUNITIES FOR COUNTIES TO SEE WHERE THEIR BEST OPPORTUNITIES ARE. THIS IS A LOT OF MONEY I'M NOT SURE IT'S GOING TO BE ENOUGH MONEY BUT THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE INCENTIVES. THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO SEE IS OKAY COUNTIES YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT SOMETHING. WE NEED TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE IMPLEMENTATION IS IT IS THIS VISION OF. BEST OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUTH FOR THEIR DEVELOPMENT FOR THEIR FUTURE HOW DOES YOUR PROGRAM HOW DOES YOUR PLAN. FIT THE STATE'S ULTIMATE GOAL AND IF IT DOES THEN YES COUNTIES ARE GOING TO HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO THESE KINDS OF INVESTMENTS THE STATE IS GOING TO HAVE TO STEP IN AND PROVIDE THOSE KINDS OF. THAT THAT HELP FOR THOSE INVESTMENTS TO HAVE THE CONFIDENCE. THAT THOSE COUNTY PROGRAMS ARE BENEFITING THE KIDS THE WAY THAT WE ARE VISITING AND SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE HEARING HERE WIT WITH THE CONCERNED AND A LITTLE BIT OF. IS THE TIMING AND WE SEEM TO OFTEN WHERE THERE'S LARGE PARTS OF MONEY EVERYBODY WANTS US POTS OF MONEY. WE FIND WAYS TO GET OUT THE DOOR. THERE'S TOO MUCH AT STAKE HERE WITH THESE KIDS TO DO THAT TOO QUICKLY SO I THINK THIS COMMITTEE. WOULD BE BETTER SERVED UNDERSTANDING THE VARIOUS ROLES HERE UNDERSTANDING WHAT SOME OF THE CONSTRAINTS ARE WHAT SOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS ARE WHAT THE COUNTY'S PLANS ARE. AND THESE ARE GOING TO BE NOT NECESSARILY COUNTY BY COUNTY FACILITIES BECAUSE SOME OF OUR SMALL COUNTIES ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE. THE RESOURCES TO BE BLE TO DEVELOP AND MANAGE SOME OF SOME OF WHAT THE THEIR OBLIGATIONS ARE GOING TO BE IT WILL NEED TO BE ON A REGIONAL BASIS. AND SO FOR US TO UNDERSTAND WHAT SOME WHAT'S GOING TO BE REGIONAL WHAT'S GOING TO BE SPECIFIC COUNTY WHICH COUNTIES ARE GOING TO GET WHAT. TELL WHAT THOSE RESOURCES ARE SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE. NOT NECESSARILY EQUALLY BUT EQUITABLY ACROSS THE STATE THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR EVERY KID IN EVERY COUNTY. TO HAVE THE SAME ABILITY. TO ADDRESS WHATEVER IT IS THEY THEY NEED TO ADDRESS TO BECOME PRODUCTIVE TO GET OUT OF THE SYSTEM. BACK INTO SCHOOL BACK INTO JOBS BACK INTO OUR COMMUNITY IN A PRODUCTIVE WAY. SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM ME PERSONALLY. THE HUNDRED MILLION SOUNDS LIKE A BIG NUMBER I THINK IN THE END IT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH BUT WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT. IS THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS BY WHICH THESE GRANTS ARE BEING. ARTICULATED BEING DEVELOPED AND THEN BEING AWARDED AND THEN WHAT THE ACCOUNTABILITY IS. SO I THINK THAT'S THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE FRUSTRATION IS THAT YOU'RE HEARING. WE WANT YOU WE NEED YOU TO DO WITH HOW. WE ACROSS THE BOARD WITH ALL OF THESE. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO UNDERSTAND AWAY SEE OURS ROLE. EN SUITE WHAT THEIR VISION IS THAT THEY'RE JUST GETTING THAT STARTED. SO THINK THE CAUTION IS. NOT TO DO THIS TOO QUICKLY EVEN THOUGH I UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO MOVE QUICKLY ON THIS IN THE POSITION THAT THE COUNTIES ARE IN BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO BE CLEAR THAT WHAT WE'RE INVESTING IN THROUGH THIS PROCESS. MEATS ARE UNDERLYING GOALS HERE. THE MANAGER MY RESPONSE. YES THANK YOU- ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE I THINK YOUR COMMENTS WERE VERY WELL TAKEN- THE TIME URGENCY AS WE'VE SPOKEN ABOUT A COUPLE OF TIMES REALLY HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT IN SEVENTEEN MONTHS COUNTIES ARE GOING TO NEED TO HAVE- LET'S HOPE- DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE TRAUMA INFORMED CULTURALLY SENSITIVE EVIDENCE BASED- OPTIONS AS THEY ARE- YOU KNOW APPEARING BEFORE THE JUVENILE COURT- I JUST WANTED TO MENTION ONE OTHER THING AND I'M THE ALLEY- MENTIONED- THE TOPIC OF THE FACT THAT IT IS. IT'S ABSOLUTELY CORRECT NOT EVERY COUNTY ACROSS OUR FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. HAS JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITIES THERE ABSOLUTELY WILL BE A VARIETY OF COUNTIES THAT NEED TO WORK WITH LET'S HOPE MAJOR NEIGHBORING COUNTIES OR OR- YOU KNOW REGIONS WITHIN THE STATE BUT IT'S FIGHT WE CAN PROVIDE A LIST- TO THE BUDGET COMMITTEE STAFF WITH THEIR FIFTEEN COUNTIES IN THE STATE. THEY DON'T HAVE ANY JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITY SO I USE THAT AS ONE EXAMPLE OF I THINK IT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY DOABLE TO HAVE SOME. POLICY GUIDANCE PUT IN ALONG WITH THIS FINDING THAT REFLECTS WHAT THE LEGISLATURE AND WHAT THIS BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE IS CONCERNED ABOUT. ABOUT ENSURING THAT THE FUNDING IS INVESTED IN ALL OF THE POLICY GOALS THAT ARE. WOVEN THROUGH SB EIGHT TWENTY THREE I THINK IT'S COMPLETELY DOABLE AND I'LL JUST SAY AGAIN THE TIME URGENCY COMES FROM THE FACT THAT- DJJ IS CLOSING IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE SELF. THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS. ANYONE ELSE- FIFTY TWO PLEASE LISTEN TO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE AND MYSELF WE HAVE COMMON GOALS BUT THIS PROPOSAL THE SAN. WE'RE NOT CONVINCED THAT THIS PROPOSAL GETS US TO OUR COMMON GOALS AND THAT WERE BEING- PRUDENT WITH OUR WITH OUR INVESTMENT- AND SO I DO HOPE WE HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND- A BETTER APPROACH COME COMEY. THANK YU FOR WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN OUR GUN BUYBACK PROGRAM. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR KATIE HOWARD AGAIN FOR THE BST STEAM- I WANTED TO GET AGAIN IN THE INTEREST OF TIME IS SUPER BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THIS PROPOSAL ON IT IS THAT IT'S PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S- PACKAGE ON SOME- PUBLIC SAFETY- ENHANCEMENTS THAT ARE IN THE BUDGET THIS YEAR THE GUN BUYBACK PROPOSAL IS. TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS- ONE TIME GENERAL FUND- AND I ALSO FOUGHT YOUR- AGENDA LAID OUT THE ISSUES- REALLY WELL- AND THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE HAS RAISED SOME SIMILAR CONCERNS ABOUT. HOW WILL WE KNOW IF SUCH A PROGRAM IS SUCCESSFUL- IT CALLS IN OBJECTIVES ARE NOT SPELLED OUT SO. I WOULD ANTICIPATE THAT THERE WOULD ABSOLUTELY BE NOT ONLY THE NEED FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO MORE SPECIFICALLY STATE GOALS FOR THIS PROGRAM AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS. I KNOW THAT YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MANY OF THE- COMMITTEE MEMBERS YOU'RE ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH THE- EXTENSIVE GRANT RESPONSIBILITIES THAT. THE PSEC IS USING. YES YOU SEE HOW. AND- IF I MAY I THINK WE DO A- GOOD JOB WHEN WE HAVE A NEW GRANT PROGRAM TO BRING SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS TO THE TABLE- FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF BACKGROUNDS- AND DISCIPLINES AND LIVED EXPERIENCES SOMEONE. SO DOWN THE ROAD AFTER SOME MORE SPECIFIC CALLS MIGHT BE SPELLED OUT BY THE LEGISLATURE THAT EXECUTIVE STEERING COMMITTEE THAT BUILDS THE GRANT- ITSELF THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND SCORING CRITERIA AND ALL OF THAT- THERE WOULD BE ALL OF THE- NECESSARY ACCOUNTABILITY IN PLACE SO. THAT THIS INVESTMENT IN- YOU KNOW. INSURING GUNS ARE- THAT WE HAVE A REDUCTION IN GUNS AND THAT WE HAVE A BETTER ABILITY TO EDUCATE YOUNG PEOPLE ABOUT ON THE DANGERS OF GUNS AND GUN VIOLENCE- WE CAN GET TO SOME SHARED GOALS- AGREEMENT ON WHAT THE SHARED GOALS SHOULD BE A BUSY SEASON A REALLY GOOD POSITION TO IMPLEMENT A NEW CRAFT PROGRAM SO I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO HEAR ABOUT THE LACK OF SPECIFICITY- IN THIS PROPOSAL AND WE'RE HAPPY TO TALK FURTHER ON. HOW TO GET THIS IN SHAPE THAT THIS SUBCOMMITTEE IS MORE COMFORTABLE WITH. AND IT I NEED ONLY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- MISS HOWARD DID PREVIOUS OVER COMMENTS FOR YOU- AND SO THIS PROPOSAL IS ONE OF NINE TOTAL PROPOSAL THAT MAKE UP THE GOVERNOR'S PUBLIC SAFETY PACKAGE- WE DID RAISE CONCERNS WITH ABOUT SEVEN OF THEM AND RECENTLY REPORT. RELEASED A REPORT THAT OFFERS A FRAMEWORK FOR LEGISLATIVE DELIBERATION OF THE PACKAGE IN IT IN TOTAL. AS WELL AS OPTIONS FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION- MY COMMENTS TODAY ARE GONNA FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON FIREARMS AND THIS PROPOSAL. SO SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THIS PROPOSAL. WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THIS PROPOSED GRANT PROGRAM ALONG WITH A COUPLE OF OTHER- BUT YOU'LL BE HEARING AT A LATER HEARING. WOULD PROVIDE THE SEC WITH SIGNIFICANT IMPLEMENTATION OF FORTY AFTER THE BUDGET IS ENACTED. SO BECAUSE OF THIS IT IS CURRENTLY UNCLEAR HOW THE FUNDING WOULD BE ALLOCATED AND USED AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO ASSESS WHETHER THE PROGRAMS WOULD ACTUALLY BE EFFECTIVE. SO FOR EXAMPLE WITH GUN BUYBACKS. THEY CAN BE TARGETED TO ADDRESS DIFFERENT PURPOSES SUCH AS TO REDUCE FIREARM SUICIDE OR TO REDUCE THE FIREARM CRIME RELATED VIOLENCE. SO IF THE GOAL IS TO REDUCE FIREARM CRIME RELATED VIOLENCE RESEARCH ACTUALLY SHOULDN'T SUGGESTS. THAT THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS ARE MORE EFFECTIVE AT THEIR STRUCTURE IN PARTICULAR WAY. SUCH AS REQUIRING THAT FIREARMS BE WORKING. IN ORDER TO RECEIVE AN INCENTIVE PRIORITIZING THE TYPES OF FIREARMS THAT ARE GENERALLY USED IN CRIMES. AND OR FOCUSING ON THE TYPES OF INDIVIDUALS OR LOCATIONS THAT ARE MORE PRONE TO FIRE OF VIOLENCE. BUT AT THIS POINT IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER OR NOT THAT WOULD BE PART. OF- THIS PROPOSAL. MORE BROADLY WHEN THE LEGISLATURE THINKING THE ENTIRE SAFETY PACKAGE WE DO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE DETERMINE ITS HIGHEST PRIORITY PUBLIC SAFETY GALS. SPECIFIED CLEAR OBJECTIVES TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS AND THEN PROVIDE THE FUNDING IN A MANNER THAT ACTUALLY ENSURES THAT THOSE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES ARE ACHIEVED. SO IN TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT THOSE HIGHEST PRIORITY PUBLIC SAFETY GOALS THEY MAY OR MAY NOT INCLUDE FIREARMS. IF THE LEGISLATURE IS INTERESTED IN PRIORITIZING CERTAIN FIREARM RELATED POLLS. DATA DOES INDICATE THAT THERE HAS BEEN A GROWTH IN HOMICIDE FIREARM DEATHS AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN THE SHARE OF HOMICIDES AGGRAVATED ASSAULTS AND ROBBERIES THAT INVOLVED FIREARMS. ADDITIONALLY AS OF JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE THEY WERE NEARLY TWENTY THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS ON THE STATE'S ARMED AND PROHIBITED PERSONS LAST- THIS COMMITTEE HAS HEARD OF THEM BEFORE THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO SUBSEQUENTLY BECOME PROHIBITED FROM POSSESSING- FIREARMS OR AMMUNITION THAT THEY HAD LEGALLY PURCHASED AFTER THEY ARE CONVICTED OF. FELONIES OR CERTAIN MISDEMEANORS FOUND BY A COURT TO BE A DANGER TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS DUE TO MENTAL ILLNESS. OR HAVE A RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST THEM AND RESEARCH HAS INDICATED THAT FARM PRINT PROHIBITIONS AGAINST SOME OF THESE INDIVIDUALS CAN HELP DECREASE VIOLENT CRIME OR HOMICIDE. AS HIGHLIGHTED IN YOUR AGENDA WE'VE HIGHLIGHTED- TWO OPTIONS. THAT COULD HELP ADDRESS FIREARM RELATED GOALS- IF IT'S A PRIORITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE. THE FIRST ONE IS. THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED TEN MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND LAST YEAR- AS PART OF THIS YEAR'S BUDGET FOR DOJ'S GUN VIOLENCE REDUCTION PROGRAM. TO ENABLE COUNTY SHERIFF'S TO HELP REDUCE THE ARMED AND PROHIBITED PERSONS LIST BY SEIZING FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION FROM THOSE WHO SHOULDN'T HAVE THEM. SO THE LEGISLATURE IS INTERESTED IN FURTHER REDUCING THE NUMBER ON THIS LIST IT COULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO THIS PROGRAMME. AND MAKE OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES SUCH AS THE CITY POLICE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR THE GRANTS. THE SECOND OPTION IS OF THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO LIMIT THE GROWTH OF THE ARMED AND PROHIBITED PERSONS LAST AND THAT WOULD BE TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND PROBATION DEPARTMENTS. TO ENSURE THAT FIREARMS ARE RELINQUISHED AT THE TIME INDIVIDUALS ARE GOING THROUGH THE COURT PROCEEDINGS WHERE THEY'RE ULTIMATELY DETERMINES- TICKET. THERE ULTIMATELY PROHIBITED FROM OWNING THOSE FIREARMS. SO THAT WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU. JUST A MOMENT THE FINANCE HI GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I WE JUST WANTED TO REITERATE WHAT MISS HOWARD INITIALLY SAIDTHAT WE THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES THAT THAT GUN BUYBACK PROGRAM IS. SORT OF A COMPREHENSIVE MULTI PRONGED. COMPONENT OF REDUCING GUN VIOLENCE IN CALIFORNIA- COINCIDING WITH YOU KNOW VARIOUS PROPOSED LEGISLATION LIKE AB FIFTEEN NINETY FOUR AB TWENTY FIVE SEVENTY ONE OR AB SIXTEEN TWENTY ONE JUST KIND OF. THE COMMENT THAT THE ISSUE OF GUN VIOLENCE FROM AS MANY ANGLES AS POSSIBLE I WE DO ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT THE EXISTING LANGUAGE IN THE PROPOSED GOVERNOR'S BUDGET REQUIRES A 10% CASH OR IN KIND MATCH. FROM PARTICIPATING GRANTEES AND THAT- INCENTIVES MAY BE PROVIDED FOR FOLKS THAT RELINQUISHING FUNCTIONAL FIREARMS AND THE ADMINISTRATION IS MORE THAN HAPPY TO CONTINUE LEGISLATURE AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS THE KIND OF ENSURE THAT THIS PROGRAM IS EFFECTIVE IT'S POSSIBLE IT REDUCING THE NUMBER OF GUNS IN CALIFORNIA. I'M MORE. THAN HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. I THANK YOU FOR THE ADMINISTRATION I KNOW. ARE THESE BUY BACK PROGRAMS. DO NOT ALWAYS REQUIRE THAT THESE GUNS BE DESTROYED- SOMETIMES THEY SHOW UP ON THE AUCTION BLOCK WITH THIS PROPOSAL DO YOU ARE YOU PLANNING TO INCLUDE THE REQUIREMENT THAT ALL GUNS COLLECTED BE DESTROYED UNLESS THEY'RE FOUND TO BE PART OF EVIDENCE IN A CASE. THIS IS KATIE HOW ARE WITH THE BSE SEEKS OF DETAIL IN- BUILDING OUT THE PROPOSAL BUT THAT IS THE SORT OF THING THAT CERTAINLY COULD BE ADDED- AND PROFESSIONAL LANGUAGE AS PART OF THE BUDGET. SO BACK TO JUST A AND THOSE DETAILS REALLY MATTER THIS IS A DETAIL THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR OUR ULTIMATE GOAL IN ADDITION TO AS WE HEARD FROM. THE ALLEY- OTHER PROGRAMS THAT BE MIGHT BE MORE BENEFICIAL AND ACTUALLY TAKING GUNS A- OFF THE STREETS OUT THERE AND THAT INVESTMENT AS WELL- AND SO WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE THAT THAT A MINIMUM. WE INCLUDE THAT PIECE. IN THIS VENTURE PRESSURED MR LACKEY F. YES SOME. IN THE PAST WE'VE BEEN TOLD BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AT THE PACE GOLDFRAPP'S INVESTIGATORS IS INSUFFICIENT TO ATTRACT ENOUGH STAFF. IS ANY OF THE REQUESTED FUNDING EXPECTED EXPECTED TO ADDRESS THE NEED TO. INCREASE THE PAY FOR THOSE NEEDED. TO FILL THESE APPS INVESTIGATED POSITIONS BECAUSE HERE'S MY FRUSTRATION WE HAVE. IDENTIFIED AS OF JANUARY. PERSONS. THAT'S A HUGE LIABILITY THAT AND IT'S BEEN AN UNMANAGEABLE NUMBER SINCE I'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE WE DON'T IT'S GROWING IT'S NOT GETTING ANY BETTER. AND WE HAVE THIS POT OF MONEY THAT WE'RE GOING TO- SUPPOSEDLY ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. BUT GUN BUY BACK DOESN'T DISARM THESE PEOPLE. SO MUCH MY QUESTION IS WHAT ARE WE DOING TO FIX THIS OF. THIS HUGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE THREATENING OUR PUBLIC. THAT'S IT THAT'S MY QUESTION I GUESS MORE SPECIFICALLY AS ANY OF THE MONEY TOWARDS THE INCREASE TO PAY. FOR INSTIGATORS. I'M SORRY I SAID NOT AT THIS TIME. THAT'S IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE THAT WOULD BE A LOGICAL CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU EIGHTY WITH MR LIKE IS COMMON IS JUST- IS THIS THE BEST WAY FOR US TO REACH OUR GOAL OF ELIMINATING GUNS ON THE STREET ARE THERE ADDITIONAL WAYS TO DO THROUGH POLICY OR OTHER INVESTMENTS US THIS LUCKY IF IS BRINGING UP I KNOW THAT THIS PROGRAM MIGHT BE A FILL THE PROGRAM- BUT IT'S NOT SURE THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY GETTING THEIR MONEY'S WORTH AT THE END OF THE DAY- IT IF WE HAVE BETTER WAYS TO DO THIS SPECIALLY WHEN THE FUNDS ARE NOT BEING DESTROYED. AND EVERYTHING BEING PUT BACK UP ON THE AUCTION BLOCK- AND SIZE BEST DISCUSSIONS CONTINUE ON THIS PIECE OF WE COULD PLEASE SUPPLEMENT WITH ADDITIONAL THINGS THAT WE COULD DO BEYOND. THIS GUN BY PROGRAM. GUN BUY BACK PROGRAM- IF THERE ARE NO MORE FOR QUESTIONS THAT WAS OUR LAST ISSUE AND I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND THANK OUR PANELISTS FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND MOVE ON TO PUBLIC COMMENT. THERE IS NO ONE IN THE ROOM FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. SO I WILL MOVE ON TO THE- TELEPHONE FEATURES AND HAS UP TO ONE MINUTE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT.
