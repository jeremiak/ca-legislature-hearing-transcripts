THE BILL WILL BRING TRANSPARENCY TO THE NEW THIS NEWLY LEGALIZED INDUSTRY AND PROVIDE THE PUBLIC AND INTERESTED STAKEHOLDERS WITH THE CENTRALIZED LIST OF WHO IS APPLYING FOR THE CANNABIS LICENSES. AND WHO IS LICENSED IN THE STATE. THE BILL DOES NOT SEEK TO DISCLOSE INFORMATION THAT COULD NOT BE ATTAINED THROUGH A PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST AND IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE AVERAGE CITIZEN MAY NOT UNDERSTAND HOW TO RECEIVE. THIS INFORMATION THROUGH A PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST. WE KNOW LICENSING AUTHORITIES CURRENTLY PROVIDE SIMILAR INFORMATION AS REQUIRED IN SB.

MINORITY COMMUNITIES NCBA STRONGLY SUPPORTS SB -- FIVE NINETY FIVE OUR NATIONS ARE INDUSTRIES MINORITY ENTREPRENEURS CONTINUE TO COMPETE ON A VERY UNLEVEL PLAYING FIELD. THE HIGH COST OF STATE LICENSING AND RENEWAL FEES CREATE AN ADDITIONAL IMPEDIMENT THAT THREATENS TO PREVENT MOST MINORITY CAMPUS BUSINESSES FROM GETTING BEYOND. A BUSINESS PLAN AND LAUNCHING LAWFUL OPERATIONS THAT CAN COMPETE ON A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD WITH OTHER CANDIDATES BUSINESSES. WHILE THESE FEES ARE TEAR THEY ARE COLLECTED FROM PRE REVENUE BUSINESS IS BASED ON EXPECTED REVENUE USING IT QUICKLY CLIMB INTO THE TENS AND EVEN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. FOR THESE REASONS NCBA FEELS THAT MANDATING STATE LICENSING AGENCIES TO CREATE AND IMPLEMENT APPLICATION LICENSE FEE WAIVERS AND DEFERRALS FOR QUALIFIED APPLICANTS AND LICENSEES UNDER.

IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE UNBELIEVABLE HOW WE GOT HERE -- QUITE AWHILE AGO CANNABIS WAS ILLEGAL IN THE STATE AND MANY BLACK AND LATINO PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED CONVICTED AND INCARCERATED A FOR CANDACE Là VIOLATIONS I FAST FORWARD TO TODAY AND WE HAVE THE PASSAGE OF PROP SIXTY FOUR IN THE CREATION OF A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY. UNFORTUNATELY SO MANY BLACK AND LATINO PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CUT OUT OF THIS INDUSTRY LARGELY BECAUSE CAPITAL JUST DOES NOT EXIST -- WE KNOW FROM A REPORT BY THE MIND OR AT BY THE MEN OF MARIJUANA DAILY -- MARIJUANA BUSINESS DAILY I THAT FEWER THAN ARE BLACK OR LATINO AND THIS IS A SHAME THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN CERTAINLY DO SOMETHING ABOUT WE KNOW THAT THE PASSAGE OF SB FIVE NINETY FIVE WOULD FURTHER THE PURPOSE IS AN ATTENTIVE PROP.

ELEVEN TO ONE WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ADDITIONAL MEMBERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUR FINAL OTHER THAN IS. FILE ITEM NUMBER ONE SB ONE FORTY TWO BY SENATOR WIENER SENATOR WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN IT'S COULD BE BACK. SO OUR FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN IN THE KEY STEP FOR WORKING WITH US ON THE BILL WERE HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. ARE COLLEAGUES -- SB -- ONE FORTY TWO WILL ENSURE THAT -- NEW MOTHERS ARE ABLE TO POST RETURN TO WORK AND CONTINUE -- TO BREAST FEED ARE RIGHT NOW FAR TOO MANY WOMEN -- PARTICULARLY -- OF NEW MOTHERS WHO ARE -- LOWER INCOME -- AND DO NOT HAVE SORT OF FANCY JOBS WITH PRIVATE OFFICES ARE FORCED TO CHOOSE DO I RETURN TO WORK. AND STOP BREAST FEEDING MY CHILD. WHERE DO I CONTINUE TO BREAST FEED MY CHILD AND DELAY RETURNING TO WORK -- EITHER ONE IS UNTENABLE WHETHER TALKING ABOUT THE ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES ABOUT FAMILY -- OR THE HEALTH OF THE CHILD. AND THIS IS A FALSE CHOICE SO WHAT THE BILL DOES IS IT. PROVIDES SOME VERY BASIC AND STRAIGHTFORWARD REQUIREMENTS -- TO ENSURE THAT WOMEN ARE ABLE TO EXPRESS MILK AT WORK -- THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO IN A RESTROOM WHICH IS EXISTING LAW. BY EVEN IF WE'RE NOT REQUIRING THEM TO IN A RESTROOM SHOULD NEVER HAVE TO DO -- WE ALSO DON'T WANT -- WOMEN TO HAVE TO GO AND EXPRESS GOLD IN A BROOM CLOSET FOR EXAMPLE SO THE THE BILL REQUIRES THAT THE EMPLOYER PROVIDE A PRIVATE SPACE. WE CAN BE A ROOM FOR EMPLOYERS WERE ROOM DOESN'T WORK EITHER IS NO ROOM YOU CAN HAVE A TEMPORARY STRUCTURE IT'S VERY FLEXIBLE AND HOW THAT IS LAID OUT. WITH A TABLE WITH A CHAIR -- WITH AN OUTLET -- AND WITH NEARBY ACCESS TO REFRIGERATION AND RUNNING WATER -- THIS IS NOT AN EXTREME -- REQUIREMENT -- I THINK IT'S THE LEAST WE CAN DO -- TO PEOPLE WHO ARE -- BRINGING FORTH THE NEXT GENERATION OF HUMANKIND -- TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN -- BOTH WORK AND BREAST FEED. NOW WE KNOW THAT BREAST FEEDING HAVE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH BENEFITS -- FOR FOR BABIES -- AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT WHEN WE MAKE IT HARD FOR WOMEN TO RETURN TO WORK AFTER GIVING BIRTH -- DIED IT SETS THEM BACK ON WE LOOK AT DISPARITIES IN PAY AND ALL THE INEQUITIES GENDER INEQUITIES IN THE WORKPLACE. PART OF THAT IS THAT WE MAKE IT HARD FOR WOMEN. AND MOTHERS TO RETURN TO WORK AND IT HAS A PERMANENT IMPACT AND SO THIS WILL HELP TO REDUCE THOSE DISPARITIES -- SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AIBO -- AND WITH ME TODAY WE HAVE A SERAPH ISTER -- MOTHER FROM MILL VALLEY WHO -- WILL SHARE HER PERSONAL STORY ROBBIE GONZALEZ I DOUBT FROM THE CONTINENT CALIFORNIA BREASTFEEDING COALITION -- AND CATHERINE WHICH IT FROM LEGAL AID AT WORK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR WE HEAR AND FOR WITNESSES WHICH IS B. CAN SUPPORT UP TO THREE MINUTES IN TOTAL. I'M ROBBIE GONZALEZ DOWN WITH THE CALIFORNIA BREASTFEEDING COALITION AND WE'RE CO SPONSOR THE BILL AND I'M GOING TO GIVE MY TIME TO SERRA -- MOM CALLED US ABOUT HER CONCERNS IN HER WORKPLACE.

WOMEN IN EATING LIKE THIESSEN AT WORK. FOUR AND A HALF MONTHS AFTER OF THIS BETH WAS BORN AND RETURN TO WORK MY EMPLOYER HAD. A DESIGNATED ROOM WHICH I THOUGHT WAS A SIGN THAT THEY WOULD PROVIDE ADVOCATES SUPPORT TO NURSING MOMS. UNFORTUNATELY. THIS SPACES AND CONVENIENT IT WAS A FOUR MINUTE WALK FROM MY WORKS WORK SPACE WHICH I HAD TO DO THREE TIMES A DAY WHICH WAS LIKE A TOTAL OF TWENTY TWENTY FIVE MINUTES. WHICH I COULD HAVE SPENT% DEDICATED TO WORKING WHICH I WASN'T ABLE TO SEE YOU. AND MANY TIMES WHEN I WALKED THERE TO USE IT WAS OCCUPIED. AND I HAD TO WAIT. IN THE FIRST TIME I WANT TO USE IT WITH HIM AND CLEAN. THEY WERE DEAD ANTS EVERYWHERE IN THE TRAPS AND THERE'S TRASH IN THE ROOM. NO TRASH RECEPTACLES IT'S TRASH ON FOR I WAS PANICKED BECAUSE MY HUSBAND AND I BOTH ONE AND FOR ME TO CONTINUE BREASTFEEDING -- SPIT AFTER I RETURNED TO WORK. IT'S WHAT OUR PEDIATRICIAN RECOMMENDED IT AND IT WAS THE BEST AND HEALTHIEST OPTION. FOR HER AND WOULD GIVE HER THE BEST START IN HER LIFE AND THE BRIGHTEST FUTURE. DESPITE MY EFFORTS WITH EDUCATING MY EMPLOYER AND LACTATION ACCOMMODATION BEST PRACTICES. AND WITHOUT HAVING HELP FROM A THIRD PARTY OR ANY SPECIFIC LAWS MARK QUEST FOR BETTER SUPPORT WHAT'S NEXT. ALMOST EVERY DAY I HAD TO WAIT. TO SOMETIMES SORTS THAT I COULD MAKE MY NEXT MEETING. THREE SIX SHORT WEEKS OF BEING BACK MY MILK SUPPLY WAS DIMINISHED IT WAS GONE. IT WAS DEVASTATING WATCHING MY SUPPLY DECREASE WEEK AFTER WEEK WITHOUT ANY SUPPORT. I FELT LIKE MY RIGHT TO BREAST FEED WAS BEING DENIED AND THAT THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO ABOUT IT. AND WHEN MY SUPPLY FIRST BEGAN TO DECLINE I THOUGHT ABOUT QUITTING MY JOB. I FELT LIKE I HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN MY JOB AND BREAST FEEDING MY DAUGHTER. I MADE A PROMISE TO MY DAUGHTER'S WHICH IS WHY I AM HERE TODAY TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON SB. ONE FOUR TWO SO THAT WHEN ELIZABETH MARY AND SELL WE ARE GROWN UP. AND JOIN THE WORKPLACE. THERE WILL BE FALLS IN PLACE. TO SUPPORT THEM AND THEY WILL ABLE BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY PROVIDE FOR THEIR CHILDREN WELL ALSO FOLLOWING THEIR CAREER GOALS AND ASPIRATIONS.

SIX NINE NOW CALLED MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PLEASE FEEL FREE TO COME UP TO THE TABLE HERE. AND AGAIN THAT NO MORE THAN THREE MINUTES OF TESTIMONY INS IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THAT HAVE BECOME AFTER THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE'RE RESPECTFULLY POSTED THIS BILL -- WE SUPPORT LACTATION ACCOMMODATION IN THE OVERALL GOALS BUT WE DO HAVE SOME SPECIFIC CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL. WE WORKED WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIMóN LAST YEAR ON HER AB NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX WHICH IS SIGNED INTO LAW. I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY BECAUSE I THINK THE AUTHOR SAID CURRENT LAWS A RESTROOM. IN THE LAW LAST YEAR SAID THE LACTATION SPACE HAS TO BE OTHER THAN A BATHROOM SO IT'S NOT ALLOWED TO BE THE RESTROOM -- WE TESTIFIED IN LABOR COMMITTEE LAST WEEK ABOUT SOME OF OUR CONCERNS WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL LOCATED IN THE LABOR CODE AND THE DUPLICATION. AND POTENTIAL LITIGATION THAT THOSE -- PROVISIONS COULD CREATE -- ALL LIMIT MY TESTIMONY TODAY TO THE BUILDING STANDARDS REQUIREMENTS -- WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE NEW BUILDING STANDARDS REQUIREMENTS BASED ON THE EXPERIENCE OF THE SAN FRANCISCO ORDINANCE WOULD RESULT IN BETWEEN THIRTY AND A HUNDRED AND FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN COSTS TO BUSINESSES. AND WHILE THE BILL ELIMINATED THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS IT SAYS THAT THE SAN FRANCISCO ORDINANCE IS THE STARTING POINT AND SO WE THINK THAT'S ESSENTIALLY THE SAME. I JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT GOVERNOR BROWN VETOED A SIMILAR BILL LAST YEAR SB NINE THIRTY SEVEN NOT BILL DID NOT CONTAIN THE BUILDING STANDARDS REQUIREMENTS. WE'VE ALSO DOES -- PROVISION BE DELETED FROM THIS BILL BUT FOR THOSE REASONS WERE POST THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MATTHEW HARD WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS PROPERTIES ASSOCIATION WE HAVE A VERY TECHNICAL ISSUE WITH THIS BILL AND THAT IS THE BUILDING CODE REQUIREMENT. YOU HEARD TESTIMONY TODAY FROM THE AUTHOR AND FROM THE SPONSORS THAT THIS BILL ONLY REQUIRES A TABLE A CHAIR -- A POLICY AND A PLACE FOR THIS TO HAPPEN NONE OF THOSE ARE BUILDING CODES. THERE IS NOTHING FOR THE BUILDING CODE TO HAPPEN HERE -- WE SUPPORTED THE LACTATION POLICY IN SAN FRANCISCO WE HELPED WRITE THAT. ARE BONUS SAN FRANCISCO GROUP THERE'S NO BUILDING CODES AND THAT. ALL OF THAT IS DEALT WITH IN SECTION THREE OF THIS BILL IT'S ALL IN EMPLOYER ACCOMMODATION IT'S ALL A SERVICE PROVIDED TO AN EMPLOYER. THERE'S NO ACTUAL BUILDING CODE SECTION TO THIS THAT NEEDS TO BE IN THERE AT A MINIMUM WE WOULD JUST ASK THAT YOU LOOK AT SECTION ONE OF THE BILL. AND JUST CHANGE THE SHALL IN THAT SECTION TO A MAY AND THAT WOULD RESULT FOR ISSUES ON THE BUILDING CODE. AT WE WE DO WANT TO CALLS AUTHORS BEEN VERY VERY -- FORTHCOMING WITH US AND HAS ACTUALLY ADDRESS MANY OF OUR BUILDING CODE ISSUE SO WE DO APPRECIATE THAT BUT THAT ONE LITTLE CHANGE IN SECTION -- ONE WOULD WOULD RESOLVE OUR ISSUES BECAUSE THERE'S NO ACTUAL BUILDING CODES THAT NEED TO BE WRITTEN TO PROVIDE SOMEONE A TABLE A CHAIR AND A PRIVATE CLEAN ROOM THOSE ARE BUILDING CODES BUILDING BECAUSE A VERY TECHNICAL. THANK YOU -- MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS NICOLE RICE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION WE HAVE ONE ISSUE RELATED TO MANUFACTURING AND THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE HARDSHIP EXEMPTION. SO WE WERE PART OF THE GROUP WHO NEGOTIATED THE LANGUAGE THAT EXISTS TO CURRENTLY IN LAW IN LABOR CO TEN THIRTY ONE RELATED TO THE HARDSHIP EXEMPTION TO GIVE FLEXIBILITY TO MANUFACTURERS. BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT THE INDICATOR FOR WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE A HARDSHIP IS AND HOW MANY EMPLOYEES THAT YOU HAVE IS ACTUALLY RELATED TO THE CONSTRAINTS OF YOUR WORKPLACE. SO IF YOU HAVE AN INDUSTRIAL FACILITY MANY OF THESE ARE OPEN CONCEPT WORK ENVIRONMENTS THE ONLY PLACE THAT HAS AN ENCLOSED PLACE THAT WILL PROVIDE THIS IS THE SAFETY THE PRIVACY -- AND THE LIMITATION TO EXPOSURE TO FRANKLY THE BY PRODUCT OF THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS IS IN UNFORTUNATELY THE RESTROOM BUT THAT IS THE CONSTRAINTS OF THE FACILITY SO WE DON'T FEEL BAD WHETHER IT'S FIFTY PEOPLE OR FIFTY TWO EMPLOYEES THAT ARE AT THAT FACILITY. MAN FACTORS NEED FLEXIBILITY SO THAT THEY CAN COMPLY WITH THIS LAW WHEN THEY HAVE NO ABILITY TO HAVE A PERMANENT STRUCTURE AND CAN'T PLACE A TEMPORARY STRUCTURE THERE EITHER BECAUSE TO DO SO WHEN YOU HAVE. STATIONARY OR MOBILE INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT THROUGHOUT THAT OPEN SPACE CONTACT. ALL UP AND OPEN SPACE A WORK ENVIRONMENT JUST ISN'T FEASIBLE FOR THOSE REASONS AS WELL AS THE REASON STATED PREVIOUSLY WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL -- AND JUST ONE LAST THING MISTER TRY JUST WANNA KNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE HAD MEETINGS AND CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR SO WE APPRECIATE THAT BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE STILL OPPOSE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE NOW BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WILL BEGIN WITH. ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF GRAYSON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND CENTERS WIENER THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR GOOD WORK THAT YOU DO AND I JUST WANT TO STATE. RIGHT FROM THE ONSET THAT I AM ABSOLUTELY 1100% WITHOUT A SHADOW OF A DOUBT UNEQUIVOCALLY SUPPORTIVE OF LACTATION -- THE THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE A SPACE -- FOR LACTATION ACCOMMODATION -- THE TWO CONCERNS WERE BROUGHT UP BY OPPOSITION I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO HEAR YOUR RESPONSE ON AS FAR AS IS THERE A PARTICULAR REASON WHY IT IS THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES FORCES -- THE FACILITY ITSELF OR COULD IT BE BOTH OR DOES IT HAVE TO BE ONE OF THE OTHER. THAT'S THE FIRST QUESTION ON MONDAY -- SO WHAT WE PUT INTO THE BILL OF EXEMPTION THAT WE'RE IF THIS IS THE FEDERAL -- STANDARD FOR EXAMPLE SO WE CAN. SORT OF CREATE THIS ON OUR OWN REGARDING WHAT THE FEDERAL STANDARD -- SO IT'S YOU CAN CLAIM A HARDSHIP EXEMPTION IF YOU'RE FEWER THAN FIFTY EMPLOYEES IN WHICH WE ASK YOU HAVE A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT MANY BILLS IN THIS BUILDING BUT THE NEEDS OF SMALL -- SMALLER BUSINESSES AND SO THAT'S WHY THE THAT'S WHAT THE HARDSHIP EXEMPTION AS FOR THAT THE FEWER THAN. FIFTY EMPLOYEES -- I UNDERSTAND WORK WILL OF COURSE CONTINUE TO TALK TO THE MANUFACTURERS BUT IF YOU ARE A LARGE BUSINESS WITH YOU KNOW. LARGE NUMBER EMPLOYEES YOU. YOU HAVE I THINK THE ABILITY TO FIND. OR CREATE A SPACE SO THAT WOMEN CAN EXPRESS MILK WITHOUT HAVING TO SIT ON THE TOILET. TO DO IT. THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT SO -- YOU KNOW. THAT THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT THAT ARGUMENT IS ABOUT AND WE SO WE THINK THAT THE FIFTY EMPLOYEE THRESHOLD. IS THE RIGHT ONE I LIKE IT'S A WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN DIALOGUE -- SAY OVER THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS BECAUSE THIS IS OUR SECOND. ARE RUN -- AT THE BILL WE HAVE MADE -- HUGE NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS IN RESPONSE TO THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY HEARD ABOUT SOME OF THEM TODAY RIGHT -- WE MAY MEMBERS LAST YEAR WHICH WE KEPT IN THE BILL -- OVERWHELMINGLY THIS YEAR REMEMBER THIS YEAR WILL CONTINUE TO TALK TO THEM. AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION I APPRECIATE THAT RESPONSE AND I I WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE THAT THERE CAN BE SOME SPACE MADE I JUST WANTED HERE SPONSORED. THE THE OTHER -- ONE DOES COME FROM SOMEONE WHO IS A GENERAL CONTRACTOR TO BUILDERS AND IF IT DOES GET REALLY INTO A VERY TECHNICAL AREA -- WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT CHANGING BUILDING CODES AND I LOOKED THROUGH THE PROVISIONS OF YOUR BILL AND AS I DID? I MYSELF WAS REALLY STRETCH TO FIND AREAS THAT INVOLVED -- BUILDING CODES THAT MOST EVERYTHING THAT IS LISTED IN THE BILL CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED VIA THE LABOR CODE SO THIS IS A QUESTION I'M TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF YOUR BILL TODAY.% THE CELL AND THAT'S NOT A QUESTION I JUST IS THERE A PARTICULAR REASON WHY YOU FEEL IMPRESSED TO GO VERY VERY TECHNICAL AND TOUCH SOMETHING IN THE BUILDING CODE WHEN REALLY ALL THAT YOU'RE WANTING TO DO CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED VIA THE LABOR AGO. SURE AND I APPRECIATE AND WE'D AND AS MR HARGROVE AND I THANK HIM FOR KNOWLEDGE IN THAT WE CHANGED IT TO INSTEAD OF THE BILL TRYING TO DICTATE WHAT THE BUILDING CODE WOULD BE. JUST ASKING THE THE BUILDING STANDARDS COMMISSION TO COME UP WITH THAT -- THE RIGHT -- CODE AND I YOU KNOW I THINK YOU SORT OF WHAT ONE OF THE OBJECTIONS TO THIS BILL IS WE HAVE OUR PHYSICAL SPACE IT IS WHAT IT IS. AND IT'S GOING TO BE CHALLENGING FOR US TO CHANGE IT. RIGHT BECAUSE WE HAVE ERROR FOR BUILDINGS THAT HAVE EXISTING SPACE AND YOUR AND AND THAT'S WHY WE MADE THE BILL FOR THOSE EXISTING SPACE IS VERY FLEXIBLE -- IN TERMS OF IT DOESN'T HAVE TO EVEN BE ITS OWN ROOM IT CAN BE A TEMPORARY -- KIND OF SHIELD -- BUT IF YOU'RE BUILDING A NEW BUILDING WHAT I DON'T WANT TO HAVE IS AND THOSE EMPLOYERS COME BACK AS A WE BUILT IT BUT THERE'S NO BUT WE DIDN'T THERE'S NO SPACE IN HERE FOR ANYONE TO BE ABLE TO EXPRESS MILK SO. SORRY AND WE'RE GOING TO CLAIM A HARDSHIP OR WHATEVER AND SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH IS NOT THIS I DON'T ENVISION THIS IS BEING SOME SORT OF HYPER COMPLEX TECHNICAL -- BUILDING CODE PROVISION THIS IS ABOUT JUST MAKING SURE THAT AYE AYES ARE BUILDING THESE NEW COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS.
