THAT TARGETED PROCUREMENT IS

INVESTIGATION WE'VE OPENED. NOW

00:53:26.970 --> 00:53:30.273
TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT. WHAT WE

MIGHT. WHAT WE NEED TO MAKE UP

00:53:33.443 --> 00:53:34.945

OFFICES SAFETY ADVOCATES I DO

00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:38.682
THINK THAT THEY PLAYED A VERY

00:53:38.748 --> 00:53:41.051
IMPORTANT ROLE N ADVOCACY IN

00:53:41.117 --> 00:53:43.019
CERTAIN PROCEEDINGS AND MY

INTENTION SINCE I HAVE BOTH

00:53:45.522 --> 00:53:46.590
ENFORCEMENT AND POLICY UNDER

00:53:46.656 --> 00:53:49.659
ME. IT'S TO BUILD UP THE

00:53:49.726 --> 00:53:53.330
ADVOCACY PORTION WITHIN SCTV SO

00:53:53.396 --> 00:53:56.199
THAT THEY CAN- ADDRESS SAFETY

00:53:56.266 --> 00:53:57.367
CULTURE AND SOME OF THOSE OTHER

00:53:57.434 --> 00:53:59.803
TOPICS THAT ALWAYS SAY FORMERLY

00:53:59.869 --> 00:54:06.476
ADDRESSED. AND IS THERE A

00:54:06.543 --> 00:54:08.178
DIFFERENCE IN THE- A

00:54:08.244 --> 00:54:09.813
DISTINCTION BETWEEN ADVISORY

00:54:13.383 --> 00:54:14.918
SOME OF THIS HAVE YOU NOTICED

00:54:14.985 --> 00:54:16.586

00:54:21.191 --> 00:54:23.426
WALL BETWEEN THEM. YES THERE IS

00:54:23.493 --> 00:54:25.795
A VERY CLEAR FIRE WALL IN PART

00:54:25.862 --> 00:54:26.930
BECAUSE COMMON LAW IN

00:54:26.997 --> 00:54:28.832
CALIFORNIA LAW REQUIRES DOWN

00:54:28.898 --> 00:54:30.734
THE SEPARATION OF FUNCTIONS

00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:32.702
THAT'S ONLY APPROPRIATE- AND

00:54:32.769 --> 00:54:34.671
REQUIRED UNDER THE LAW SO THERE

00:54:34.738 --> 00:54:36.339
IS A VERY CLEAR DISTINCTION OF

00:54:36.406 --> 00:54:39.009

01:00:43.006 --> 01:00:45.308
THEY'VE MADE OVER THE YEARS AND

01:00:45.375 --> 01:00:47.944

01:00:48.011 --> 01:00:50.279
THERE RIGHT AND IT'S PRESIDENT

01:00:50.346 --> 01:00:54.117
TRUMAN. YOU SEEN. THE KILLINGS

RACE TRACK AND PLACE FAIRLY.

01:00:55.918 --> 01:00:59.222
UNTIL STARTING OUT A FEW YEARS

01:00:59.288 --> 01:01:01.257

SUBSTANTIALLY- IN WE NOW

01:01:05.762 --> 01:01:09.098
FORECAST FOR THE UTILITIES THAT

THEIR RATE. PLACE IN IS

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:13.803

LARGELY BY THE INVESTMENTS

01:01:15.138 --> 01:01:22.011
FALTERED IT SHOULD. SO I

01:01:22.078 --> 01:01:24.580
UNDERSTAND SO THAT I WOULD TAKE

01:01:24.647 --> 01:01:26.449
THEM TO DO THE MATH AND IF IT

01:01:26.516 --> 01:01:27.183
WAS NINE BILLION SPREAD OUT

01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:32.555
OVER TIME I WOULD EQUATE THAT

01:01:32.622 --> 01:01:33.156
TO SEVEN TO EIGHT SECONDS FOR

01:01:33.222 --> 01:01:38.694
EACH BILLION. THAT WHAT I HEARD.

IT BUT A LARGE ELEMENT DRIVING

01:01:49.539 --> 01:01:51.307
THAT RIGHT NOW. IS IF YOU WERE

MORE THAN 50% MORE AND- THAT

01:10:22.651 --> 01:10:24.186
WAS DRIVEN MAINLY. BY THE FACT

01:10:24.253 --> 01:10:25.621

01:29:23.224 --> 01:29:24.292
AT THE PC I'VE BEEN

01:29:24.358 --> 01:29:26.728
EXTRAORDINARILY. IMPRESSED WITH

01:29:26.794 --> 01:29:27.829
THE DEPTH OF KNOWLEDGE AND

01:29:27.895 --> 01:29:31.032

THEY'VE BEEN EXTREMELY KIND AND

01:29:44.145 --> 01:29:46.814
GENEROUS TO ME AS I HAVE TAKEN

01:29:46.881 --> 01:29:51.052
ON THIS ROLE AND HAD IN SOMERS

01:29:51.119 --> 01:29:52.854
QUITE A LEARNING CURVE. SO I'VE

01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:56.057
BEEN A VERY APPRECIATIVE OF.

01:29:56.124 --> 01:29:58.392
HELL THEY HAVE LISTED AND THEN

01:29:58.459 --> 01:30:00.795
AS A CERTAIN KIND TO ME. THERE

01:30:00.862 --> 01:30:02.563
ARE WE DO DO A LOT OF THE PC WE

01:30:02.630 --> 01:30:04.198

BOTH OF THOSE THINGS THAT ARE

01:30:05.767 --> 01:30:07.568
WITHIN THE CONSTITUTION AS WELL

01:30:07.635 --> 01:30:09.837
AS THOSE STATUTORY-

01:30:09.904 --> 01:30:12.807
RESPONSIBILITIES. I'M I HAVE

01:30:12.874 --> 01:30:14.475
BEEN ASKED MORE THAN ONCE ABOUT

01:30:14.542 --> 01:30:16.144
WHAT WHAT IF WE WERE TO SHED

01:30:16.210 --> 01:30:18.346
BUT WOULD BE SHED. THAT'S

01:30:18.412 --> 01:30:21.182
REALLYHARD FOR ME TO EVALUATE

01:30:21.249 --> 01:30:23.451
PRECISELY WHAT DATA AT AS I

01:30:23.518 --> 01:30:25.586
WOULD LIKE TO DO BUT THERE ARE

01:30:25.653 --> 01:30:27.522
AREAS IN THE TRANSPORTATION

01:30:27.588 --> 01:30:29.457
AREA SHOULD WE RE RE BE

01:30:29.524 --> 01:30:31.092
REGULATING UBER AND LEFT FOR

01:30:31.159 --> 01:30:33.594
EXAMPLE. YEAH NOT WHO SHOULD WE

WE SHOULD BE DOING SAFETY I

01:30:44.772 --> 01:30:46.107
THINK IT'S QUITE OBVIOUS THAT

01:30:46.174 --> 01:30:49.177
WE HAVE A VERY ROLE WHEN IT

01:30:49.243 --> 01:30:50.611

MANNER IN SO. THE SERVICES TO

IS TRUE ABOUT THE PC IS IT IS.

01:31:23.511 --> 01:31:28.649
GOV OPS TRANSPORTATION HHS SO-

01:31:28.716 --> 01:31:30.852

INTERNAL PROCESSES UNDER WAY-

01:31:36.524 --> 01:31:40.228
AND I THINK THERE'S BETWEEN

01:31:40.294 --> 01:31:42.730
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THE I IT

01:31:42.797 --> 01:31:43.331

THAT- ALSO COULD BE MORE

SPEND ON GOING IN THAT

01:46:14.768 --> 01:46:17.771
PROCEEDING HOWEVER I THINK THAT

01:46:17.838 --> 01:46:20.407
THE LABOR SHORTAGE HAS BEEN A

01:46:20.474 --> 01:46:23.410
REAL ISSUE FOR THEM- NOW WITH

01:46:23.477 --> 01:46:25.579
KOBE NINETEEN AND THE HORRIBLE

THEY SHOULD BE I'M IMPLEMENTED.

01:46:50.237 --> 01:46:52.372

LEGISLATION FOR WHICH I THINK

01:49:29.663 --> 01:49:31.364

ANY COM OR MEDICAL NEEDS OR

01:56:20.173 --> 01:56:24.577
OTHER NEEDS- FACT IS THE POCKET

01:56:24.644 --> 01:56:26.646
THAT PRESIDENT BATTER MENTIONED.

01:56:26.713 --> 01:56:29.248
OPEN UP FOR ELIGIBILITY AND NAY

01:56:29.315 --> 01:56:32.418
AND THE HUNDRED MILLION THAT

01:56:32.485 --> 01:56:35.355
WAS AVAILABLE AND THAT FINE- IS

01:56:35.421 --> 01:56:36.656
FULLY UTILIZE THAT WAS ON A

01:56:36.723 --> 01:56:38.091
FIRST COME FIRST SERVE BUT WE

01:56:38.157 --> 01:56:41.561
pDOLLARS AND APPLICATIONS. AND

01:56:41.627 --> 01:56:44.297
IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS- THE

01:56:44.364 --> 01:56:45.665
ADDITIONAL FUNDING ALLOWED

01:56:45.732 --> 01:56:47.233
UNDER SB SEVEN HUNDRED WILL BE

01:56:47.300 --> 01:56:48.768
MADE AVAILABLE FOR THAT POCKET

01:56:48.835 --> 01:56:50.269
AND I BELIEVE THAT WITHOUT

01:56:50.336 --> 01:56:51.738
HAVING A DRINKING FOR GOING TO

01:56:51.804 --> 01:56:52.638
LEAVE THAT FOR EXACT FUND UP TO

01:56:52.705 --> 01:56:55.141
ABOUT SIX HUNDRED NINE. NINE

01:56:55.208 --> 01:56:56.743
BILLION YEAH MY QUESTION IS

01:56:56.809 --> 01:56:58.578
JUST ABOUT THAT HUNDRED MILLION

01:56:58.644 --> 01:57:01.681
AND I KNOW MANY- SORT OF SMALL

01:57:01.748 --> 01:57:03.850
MOM AND POP SAY NURSING HOMES

01:57:03.916 --> 01:57:06.786
INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS- SIR

01:57:06.853 --> 01:57:09.088
LESS SOPHISTICATED ENTITIES

01:57:09.155 --> 01:57:11.124
THAT WOULD BENEFIT GREATLY WHO

01:57:11.190 --> 01:57:12.492
AREN'T IN LINE WHERE IS THE

01:57:12.558 --> 01:57:13.960
MORE SOPHISTICATED PLAYERS I

01:57:14.026 --> 01:57:16.229
THINK GOT SMART AND GOT IN LINE

01:57:16.295 --> 01:57:19.132
SO. I WOULD LOVE TO FOLLOW UP

01:57:19.198 --> 01:57:21.667
ON HOW TO BE EQUITABLE IN THAT

01:57:21.734 --> 01:57:23.469
EQUITY RESILIENCY BUDGET

01:57:23.536 --> 01:57:27.707
ALLOCATION AND REALLY THROUGH

01:57:27.774 --> 01:57:28.307
WHAT MORE WE CAN DO WITH THOSE

01:57:28.374 --> 01:57:29.575
THAT. AND WHETHER THEY CAN BE

01:57:29.642 --> 01:57:30.710
REPURPOSED IN THE FEW

01:57:30.777 --> 01:57:32.645
POTENTIALLY EVEN FOR A

01:57:32.712 --> 01:57:34.680
DISTRIBUTION SERVICES TO

01:57:34.747 --> 01:57:36.616
SUPPORT MICRO GRID DEVELOPMENT

01:57:36.682 --> 01:57:38.684
SO I APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS ON

01:57:38.751 --> 01:57:41.120
THAT I WANT TO SO WHERE DO YOU

01:57:41.187 --> 01:57:43.489
ACT THERE TO BE IN MICRO GREENS

01:57:43.556 --> 01:57:47.927
DEPLOYED BEFORE. THIS P. S. T.

01:57:47.994 --> 01:57:51.063
S. SEASON CENTER WE WERE HELP

01:57:51.130 --> 01:57:52.799
THAT. I HAVE TO BE. DIRECT

01:57:52.865 --> 01:57:55.802
HOWEVER I WAS MOST HELPFUL- IN

01:57:55.868 --> 01:57:57.937
THE P. JEANNIE CASE BECAUSE

01:57:58.004 --> 01:58:01.374
THEY- PLAN TO DO AND HAS PUT

01:58:01.441 --> 01:58:04.677
TOGETHER AN RFP- UNFORTUNATELY

01:58:04.744 --> 01:58:08.314
THAT WAS WITHDRAWN AND- THIS

01:58:08.381 --> 01:58:10.917
SUBSTATION AND THE- MICHAEL

01:58:10.983 --> 01:58:12.452
UNITS THAT THEY HAD PLANNED.

01:58:12.518 --> 01:58:14.854
ARE LIKELY THEIR BACKUP POWER

01:58:14.921 --> 01:58:19.258
WILL. LIKELY BE. YOURS FOR THAT

01:58:19.325 --> 01:58:20.193
TWENTY TWENTY AND WELFARE

01:58:20.259 --> 01:58:22.395
SEASON. AND UNFORTUNATELY I

01:58:22.462 --> 01:58:23.429
THINK THE SAME IS TRUE IN THE

01:58:23.496 --> 01:58:25.865
TELCO AREA THAT THAT THAT THE

01:58:25.932 --> 01:58:29.836
BACKUP POWER. BACKUP BATTERY

01:58:29.902 --> 01:58:31.537
GENERATION WILL MOSTLY BE

01:58:31.604 --> 01:58:34.140
THINGS THAT WILL BE. GENERATED

01:58:34.207 --> 01:58:37.710
BY DIESEL. DIESEL AND GASOLINE.

01:58:37.777 --> 01:58:39.812
I THAT'S FOR TWENTY WE HAVE IN

01:58:39.879 --> 01:58:42.515
OUR PROCEEDINGS AND IN ALL OUR

01:58:42.582 --> 01:58:45.351
DISCUSSIONS HAVE HAVE PUT FORTH

01:58:45.418 --> 01:58:48.087
THAT THEY HAVE TO STRIVE FOR

01:58:48.154 --> 01:58:51.757
TOWARD- RENEWABLE ENERGY AND

01:58:51.824 --> 01:58:54.260
THEY- IN DIFFERENT

01:58:54.327 --> 01:58:55.695
CONVERSATIONS BOTH ON THE TELCO

01:58:55.761 --> 01:58:58.364
SIDE AS WELL AS ON ME I USED

01:58:58.431 --> 01:59:00.566
SIDE. ARM THERE ARE DIFFERENT

01:59:00.633 --> 01:59:03.870
STAGES OF. ADOPTING ON

01:59:03.936 --> 01:59:06.105
RENEWABLE AND CLEAN ENERGY

01:59:06.172 --> 01:59:08.808
PLANS BUT I DO NOT THINK THERE

01:59:08.875 --> 01:59:10.910
WILL WILL SEE THAT FOR WELFARE

01:59:10.977 --> 01:59:12.545
SEASON TWENTY TWENTY

01:59:12.612 --> 01:59:14.480
DISAPPOINTING NEWS- I WOULD ASK

01:59:14.547 --> 01:59:15.681
YOU JUST FROM THE FUTURE FOR

01:59:15.748 --> 01:59:17.884
CONSIDERATION OF SOME KIND

01:59:17.950 --> 01:59:19.719
EXPEDITED UNIFORM TERROR FOR

01:59:19.785 --> 01:59:21.187
THAT KIND OF CLEAN MICROGROOVE

01:59:21.254 --> 01:59:22.722
DEVELOPMENT PERHAPS THAT WOULD

01:59:22.788 --> 01:59:25.191
SPEED THINGS ALONG- THE LAST

01:59:25.258 --> 01:59:26.759
QUESTION GOES TO THE NATURAL

01:59:26.826 --> 01:59:28.327
GAS SAFETY ISSUE THAT SENATOR

01:59:28.394 --> 01:59:30.162
HILL MENTIONED EARLIER- LITTLE

01:59:30.229 --> 01:59:31.664
DIFFERENT PART OF THE SYSTEM

01:59:31.731 --> 01:59:33.399
DOWN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND

01:59:33.466 --> 01:59:35.601
AS YOU KNOW- MY DISTRICT AND

01:59:35.668 --> 01:59:37.870
BROADER LA WAS IMPACTED GREATLY

01:59:37.937 --> 01:59:38.971
BY THE ALLEY SO CANYON BELOW

01:59:39.038 --> 01:59:41.440
OUT. THE DATA WE'VE SEEN SHOWS

01:59:41.507 --> 01:59:45.211
A MARKET INCREASING UTILIZATION

01:59:45.278 --> 01:59:48.147
OF THAT STORAGE ASSET. IN LA BY

01:59:48.214 --> 01:59:50.783
ARE COUNTING OVER 3000%

01:59:50.850 --> 01:59:52.952
INCREASE SINCE THE WITHDRAWAL

01:59:53.019 --> 01:59:55.121
PROTOCOL WAS CHANGED CAN YOU

01:59:55.187 --> 01:59:57.957
COMMENT ON THE PLANS FOR

01:59:58.024 --> 02:00:00.359
UTILIZATION OF A LEASE SO AND

02:00:00.426 --> 02:00:02.962
REALLY WHETHER- THERE'S STILL A

02:00:03.029 --> 02:00:05.298
COMMITMENT TO DO THE DILIGENCE

02:00:05.364 --> 02:00:07.066
ON THAT FEASIBILITY OF CLOSE

02:00:07.133 --> 02:00:10.436
YOUR ANALYSIS IN THE EXPEDITED

02:00:10.503 --> 02:00:15.141
DISCUSSED. YES SENATOR AND WE

02:00:15.207 --> 02:00:18.544
ARE- WE DO HAVE THE AMOUNT OF

02:00:18.611 --> 02:00:19.211
MONEY HAPPENED YOU HAVE

02:00:19.278 --> 02:00:22.281
BUDGETED AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT

02:00:22.348 --> 02:00:22.982
THEY GOVERNOR DIRECTED LAST

02:00:23.049 --> 02:00:25.217
FALL. AND THAT MONEY STILL AS

02:00:25.284 --> 02:00:26.986
RAIN MAINTAINED IN THE BUDGET

02:00:27.053 --> 02:00:29.155
TO DO IN IN A VERY- THOROUGH

02:00:29.221 --> 02:00:33.159
ANALYSIS OF A LEASE SO- AND WE

02:00:33.225 --> 02:00:34.694
WILL HAVE THAT UNDER WAY AS

02:00:34.760 --> 02:00:36.262
SOON AS THE BUDGET IS APPROVED.

02:00:36.329 --> 02:00:37.663
I MEAN TURN TO ADD TO GIVE YOU

02:00:37.730 --> 02:00:39.599
SOME SORT SOME OF. THE

02:00:39.665 --> 02:00:44.070
SPECIFICS I AM- I HAVE NOT SEEN

02:00:44.136 --> 02:00:46.272
THE BACKUP. IN REGARDING THAT

02:00:46.339 --> 02:00:49.342
NUMBER OF USAGE I'VE HEARD THAT

02:00:49.408 --> 02:00:51.110
NUMBER AND I WAS PUZZLED BY IT.

02:00:51.177 --> 02:00:53.012
I JUST REALIZED IN THE LAST FEW

02:00:53.079 --> 02:00:55.448
DAYS SO AND CAN YOU BE SURE.

02:00:55.514 --> 02:00:58.584
AND YOUR SENATOR STERN- YA ON

02:00:58.651 --> 02:01:01.153
THE FIRST POINT IS TO KIND OF

02:01:01.220 --> 02:01:03.689
REITERATE THE TIMING- YOU KNOW

02:01:03.756 --> 02:01:05.191
AS AS YOU'RE VERY WHERE SINCE

02:01:05.257 --> 02:01:06.058
YOU'VE BEEN TRACKING THIS EVEN

02:01:06.125 --> 02:01:10.730
SINCE BEFORE YOU WERE SENATOR-

02:01:10.796 --> 02:01:13.332
YOUNG GOVERNOR BROWN HAD- YOU

02:01:13.399 --> 02:01:15.568
KNOW THROUGH THE CDC HAD-

02:01:15.635 --> 02:01:18.137
DIRECTED THE P. ARE ASKED TO PC

02:01:18.204 --> 02:01:20.339
TO LOOK AT- FEASIBILITY OF

02:01:20.406 --> 02:01:22.375
CLOSING THE FIELD DOWN WITHIN

02:01:22.441 --> 02:01:23.676
TEN YEARS AND COME UP WITH

02:01:23.743 --> 02:01:24.810
SPECIFIC. THAT WHICH GOES

02:01:24.877 --> 02:01:27.246
BEYOND WHAT- SB THREE EIGHTY-

02:01:27.313 --> 02:01:28.714
HAD DIED AS YOU KNOW THERE BEEN

02:01:28.781 --> 02:01:30.583
SOME I CHALLENGES AND-

02:01:30.650 --> 02:01:33.119
CONTRACTING ISSUES FOR ALL. OF

02:01:33.185 --> 02:01:36.355
THAT THE PC IS COMMITTED TO-

02:01:36.422 --> 02:01:39.325
DATA ANALYSIS ON LOOKING ADD-

02:01:39.392 --> 02:01:41.360
WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO CLOSE THE

02:01:41.427 --> 02:01:43.863
FUEL DOWN- YOUR WITHIN TEN

02:01:43.929 --> 02:01:45.031
YEARS OF THE DATE THAT.

02:01:45.097 --> 02:01:50.102
GOVERNOR BROWN HAS MADE THAT.

02:01:50.169 --> 02:01:51.871
SUGGESTION WHICH IS TWENTY. ANY

02:01:51.937 --> 02:01:53.005
SEVEN AND THEN ALSO AT. A

02:01:53.072 --> 02:01:54.640
LONGER TO YOU KNOW IN THE

02:01:54.707 --> 02:01:55.374
TWENTY FORTY FIVE AS WE CAN

02:01:55.441 --> 02:01:56.776
LONG TERM ON A PLANE AROUND

02:01:56.842 --> 02:01:59.612
THAT AS WELL. AS FAR AS THIS

02:01:59.679 --> 02:02:01.714
SPECIFIC ISSUE OF THE INCREASES

02:02:01.781 --> 02:02:04.083
OF- WITHDRAWALS YEAH A LISA

02:02:04.150 --> 02:02:05.751
CANYON. YEAH IT SHOULD BE

02:02:05.818 --> 02:02:07.319
EMPHASIZED THAT THE MOST

02:02:07.386 --> 02:02:09.989
IMPORTANT- CHANGE IN OPERATION

02:02:10.056 --> 02:02:12.558
IS IMPACTS SAFETY. IS THE

02:02:12.625 --> 02:02:14.193
VOLUME OF GAS THAT STORE IN THE

02:02:14.260 --> 02:02:18.130
FIELD- AND IS YOUR- AWARE-

02:02:18.197 --> 02:02:20.666
BEFORE THE- ROB CERTAINLY SO

02:02:20.733 --> 02:02:22.468
CANYON THE MAXIMUM CAPACITY

02:02:22.535 --> 02:02:24.070
THAT FIELD WAS EIGHTY SIX

02:02:24.136 --> 02:02:26.706
BILLION CUBIC FEET- SB THREE

02:02:26.772 --> 02:02:27.940
EIGHTY REQUIRES A P. C. TO SET

02:02:28.007 --> 02:02:31.110
A LIMIT THAT IS BASED ON- THE

02:02:31.177 --> 02:02:33.179
MAX AMOUNT IT'S THE- NEEDED FOR

02:02:33.245 --> 02:02:35.781
PROVIDING RELIABILITY ADD JUST

02:02:35.848 --> 02:02:38.350
AND REASONABLE RATES SO WE LOOK

02:02:38.417 --> 02:02:38.951
AT THAT AS A BALANCE. OF BOTH

02:02:39.018 --> 02:02:40.286
THE ABSOLUTE REALIZE

02:02:40.352 --> 02:02:43.089
RELIABILITY IT ALSO IMPACTS ON-

02:02:43.155 --> 02:02:44.523
WHOLESALE AND RETAIL GAS

02:02:44.590 --> 02:02:47.393
MARKETS. THAT IS WAS SET AT

02:02:47.460 --> 02:02:49.228
THIRTY THREE MILLION. THIRTY

02:02:49.295 --> 02:02:51.797
FOUR BILLION CUBIC FEET. AND AT

02:02:51.864 --> 02:02:52.998
THIS MOMENT TIME WE HAVE NO

02:02:53.065 --> 02:02:55.301
INTENTION OF CHANGING THAT

02:02:55.367 --> 02:03:01.774
KAPPLE. NOT IN THE FUTURE THERE

02:03:01.841 --> 02:03:05.611
WAS MAYBE ARTFULLY WORD PRESS

02:03:05.678 --> 02:03:07.179
REPORTS RECENTLY THE MADE IT SO

02:03:07.246 --> 02:03:09.215
LIKE THE YOU TO ONE TO THE

02:03:09.281 --> 02:03:10.883
STORAGE UPSET EIGHTY SAY

02:03:10.950 --> 02:03:12.451
BILLION CUBIC FEET AGAIN BUT

02:03:12.518 --> 02:03:13.552
THEY WOULD NOT BE TO THAT THE

02:03:13.619 --> 02:03:16.055
CAPITAL THIRTY. IS AS THE

02:03:16.122 --> 02:03:16.889
WITHDRAWAL IS YES THEY HAVE

02:03:16.956 --> 02:03:18.758
GONE THAT THREE THOUSAND

02:03:18.824 --> 02:03:20.960
NUMBERS NOT A ON THE NUMBER OF

02:03:21.026 --> 02:03:22.862
WITHDRAWALS BUT THE VOLUME IT'S

02:03:22.928 --> 02:03:25.097
BEEN WITHDRAWN- OVER THE LAST

02:03:25.164 --> 02:03:27.500
TWO YEARS COMPARED TO- THE TWO

02:03:27.566 --> 02:03:30.770
YEARS- AFTER- NAY BEGAN

02:03:30.836 --> 02:03:32.037
WITHDRAWING FROM THE FIELD

02:03:32.104 --> 02:03:34.406
AGAIN- BUT THAT'S A LITTLE BIT

02:03:34.473 --> 02:03:35.908
OF AN APPLES TO ORANGES

02:03:35.975 --> 02:03:41.147
COMPARISON- I GIVE IN- LEAD

02:03:41.213 --> 02:03:44.517
THAT. THE DIED THOUSAND

02:03:44.583 --> 02:03:45.084
NINETEEN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY

02:03:45.151 --> 02:03:47.253
WORK COLLECTIVELY HOLDER THEN

02:03:47.319 --> 02:03:49.155
THE PREVIOUS TWO YEARS AND SO

02:03:49.221 --> 02:03:50.089
THERE'S HIGHER GAS DEMAND

02:03:50.156 --> 02:03:52.158
OVERALL- AND THEN THE

02:03:52.224 --> 02:03:54.860
CHALLENGES- THAT WE'VE HAD WITH

02:03:54.927 --> 02:03:58.197
SO CAL GAS AND A NUMBER OF

02:03:58.264 --> 02:04:03.035
PIPELINES BENG OUT OF SERVICE.

02:04:03.102 --> 02:04:05.271
TO REDUCE PRESSURE. THERE WERE

02:04:05.337 --> 02:04:06.005
THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL NOT

02:04:06.071 --> 02:04:07.940
SENATOR DODD. THANK VERY THIS

02:04:08.007 --> 02:04:11.410
CHAIRMAN. HE'S ARE DISAPPOINTED

THAT SENATOR WILL- BRADFORD IS

02:04:13.712 --> 02:04:14.446
LEFT BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO

02:04:14.513 --> 02:04:17.149
ADDRESS HIS. COMMENTS AS THE

02:04:17.216 --> 02:04:19.752
AUTHOR OF SB NINE OH ONE. I

02:04:19.819 --> 02:04:22.188
WANT TO REMIND- WHAT. EVERYBODY

02:04:22.254 --> 02:04:23.322
WHAT WE WERE DEALING WITH AT

THAT IS ONE OF THE PROPOSALS

02:27:00.211 --> 02:27:04.415
THAT THAT WE HAVE BEFORE THE PC

02:27:04.482 --> 02:27:07.318
TO SPECIFICALLY. HAVE A DOCTOR

02:27:07.385 --> 02:27:09.120
PLAN WHERE THE UTILITIES CAN

02:27:09.187 --> 02:27:13.457
WORK- WITH THE CUSTOMER- SO

02:27:13.524 --> 02:27:15.259
THAT THEY'RE AND THEY'RE JUST

02:27:15.326 --> 02:27:17.261
THEY'RE NOT DISCONNECTED AND

02:27:17.328 --> 02:27:20.198
THAT THE- VARIOUS- REAR AGES

02:27:20.264 --> 02:27:22.033
THAT THE CUSTOM MAY HAVE CAN BE

02:27:22.099 --> 02:27:24.902
PAID IN SMALL AMOUNTS GOING

02:27:24.969 --> 02:27:26.504
FORWARD. WHICH WILL NOT ONLY

02:27:26.571 --> 02:27:28.172
BENEFIT THAT CUSTOMER AND

02:27:28.239 --> 02:27:29.173
PREVENT THAT CUSTOMER FROM

BECAUSE THE DISCONNECTION IS

02:27:40.818 --> 02:27:42.853
ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE AND TRAGIC

02:27:42.920 --> 02:27:44.722
FOR THE INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER AND

02:27:44.789 --> 02:27:46.757
IT GETS A LOT OF MONEY IN AND

02:27:46.824 --> 02:27:49.460
HASSLE TO GET RECONNECTED. BUT

02:27:49.527 --> 02:27:52.530

02:27:53.130 --> 02:27:54.765
DISCONNECTIONS THAT ADDS TO THE

COST OF ALL OF THE CUSTOMERS

02:27:56.601 --> 02:27:59.904

UNDERSTAND THE BALANCE- SO THAT

02:28:54.091 --> 02:28:56.360
AS WE PURSUE AFFORDABILITY WERE

02:28:56.427 --> 02:28:58.262
NOT BEING PENNY WISE AND POUND

02:28:58.329 --> 02:29:01.065

HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE THERE AS

WELL IT SHOULD EXPLAIN IN MORE

02:29:08.506 --> 02:29:13.477
DETAIL- HOW. WHAT WAS DONE AND

02:29:13.544 --> 02:29:16.013
WHERE SOME OF THOSE COSTS AND

02:29:16.080 --> 02:29:18.449
IT'S COST SAVINGS WERE FOUND SO

02:29:18.516 --> 02:29:21.485
FOR EXAMPLE JUST TO BE CLEAR-

02:29:21.552 --> 02:29:25.389
WE STRONGLY AS AS ADVOCATES FOR

02:29:25.456 --> 02:29:27.391
CALIFORNIA'S CONSUMERS WANT THE

02:29:27.458 --> 02:29:30.461
UTILITIES TO INVEST IN SAFETY

02:29:30.528 --> 02:29:32.496
AND WE WERE IN SOME OF THE

02:29:32.563 --> 02:29:33.964
MEMBERS HERE KNOW YOU MAY BE

02:29:34.031 --> 02:29:34.732
AWARE OF THIS TO WE WERE

02:29:34.799 --> 02:29:37.335
INSTRUMENTAL. IN HELPING SET UP

02:29:37.401 --> 02:29:39.837
A PROCESS WHERE PRIOR TO AND

02:29:39.904 --> 02:29:43.007
THEN GENERATE CASES WE WOULD WE

02:29:43.074 --> 02:29:45.009
ALL OF THE PARTIES WOULD FOCUS

02:29:45.076 --> 02:29:47.545
ON THE VARIOUS SAFETY RISKS AND

02:29:47.611 --> 02:29:49.213
ASSESS WHAT THE SAFETY RISKS

02:29:49.280 --> 02:29:51.549
WORK. MOST CRITICAL TO BE

02:29:51.615 --> 02:29:53.651
ADDRESSED RIGHT AWAY- AND THEN

02:29:53.718 --> 02:29:54.819
WE WOULD TALK ABOUT COSTS

02:29:54.885 --> 02:29:56.554
BECAUSE WE BELIEVED IT WAS

02:29:56.620 --> 02:29:58.322
IMPORTANT TO SEPARATE OUT YOU

02:29:58.389 --> 02:30:00.558
KNOW THE SAFETY FROM COSTED. TO

02:30:00.624 --> 02:30:02.360
LOOK AT WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE

02:30:02.426 --> 02:30:04.228
AND THEN TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH IS

02:30:04.295 --> 02:30:07.131
IT GOING TO TAKE TO ADDRESS ON

02:30:07.198 --> 02:30:08.399
TO A NEW ADDRESS A SAFETY ISSUE

02:30:08.466 --> 02:30:10.501
SO WE'RE NOT ASKING THIS THAT

02:30:10.568 --> 02:30:12.570
THE UTILITIES TO NOT DO WORK

02:30:12.636 --> 02:30:16.006
THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE BECAUSE

02:30:16.073 --> 02:30:17.775
ON. FOR TO SAVE MONEY BECAUSE

02:30:17.842 --> 02:30:20.111
THAT WOULD BE. ANYONE HAS COME

02:30:20.177 --> 02:30:21.278
FOOLISH I WOULD AGREE WITH

02:30:21.345 --> 02:30:24.548
THAT- BUT BUT INSTEAD THERE

02:30:24.615 --> 02:30:26.484
THERE MAY BE WHAT WE WHAT WE

02:30:26.550 --> 02:30:27.918
WOULD LIKE TO SEE SO FOR

02:30:27.985 --> 02:30:29.653
EXAMPLE YOU MAY BE ONE UTILITY

02:30:29.720 --> 02:30:32.022
WILL SAY OKAY IT'LL COST US.

02:30:32.089 --> 02:30:35.993
THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY TO ADDRESS

02:30:36.060 --> 02:30:38.062
THE SAFETY ISSUE AND ANOTHER

02:30:38.129 --> 02:30:40.464
UTILITY MIGHT SAY OH IT'S GOING

02:30:40.531 --> 02:30:42.767
TO COST US YOU KNOW X. VERSES

02:30:42.833 --> 02:30:44.635
Y. AMOUNT AND SO WE ARE OR

02:30:44.702 --> 02:30:46.237
LET'S JUST SAY YOU KNOW THREE

02:30:46.303 --> 02:30:48.038
TIMES AS MUCH FOR THE SAME TYPE

02:30:48.105 --> 02:30:49.673
OF WORK WE WOULD WANT TO

02:30:49.740 --> 02:30:52.042
UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT IS DRIVING

02:30:52.109 --> 02:30:54.578
THAT DISCREPANCY SO WHY IS IT

02:30:54.645 --> 02:30:55.846
THAT ONE UTILITY CAN DO IT SO

02:30:55.913 --> 02:30:57.148
MUCH MORE COST EFFECTIVELY THAN

02:30:57.214 --> 02:30:59.250
THE OTHER. FOR THE SAME QUALITY

02:30:59.316 --> 02:31:00.885
WORK AND SO THOSE ARE THE KIND

02:31:00.951 --> 02:31:02.953
TACTIC ENQUIRIES THAT WE LOOK

02:31:03.020 --> 02:31:05.623
AT WE ALSO LOOK AT THINGS LIKE-

02:31:05.689 --> 02:31:08.893
IN THE PAST SO IF WE HAVE IF WE

02:31:08.959 --> 02:31:11.028
HAVE. IF YOU TELL IS IN AND

02:31:11.095 --> 02:31:12.363
BEEN AUTHORIZED MONEY AND

02:31:12.430 --> 02:31:14.031
GENERATE CASE TO DO CERTAIN

02:31:14.098 --> 02:31:17.501
WORK- BUT THEN SOMETIMES THEY

02:31:17.568 --> 02:31:18.836
WILL COME BACK IN THE NEXT YEAR

02:31:18.903 --> 02:31:21.138

COMMUNITIES THAT WERE SERVING.

02:38:09.112 --> 02:38:11.849
IN LIGHT- OF KOBE NINETEEN SO I

A COPY OF THE- PRESENTATION.

02:38:20.891 --> 02:38:22.025
WANTED JUST BY TAKING A LOOK AT

02:38:22.092 --> 02:38:23.994
THE TWENTY TWENTY FIRE SEASON

02:38:24.061 --> 02:38:27.364
OUTLOOK- WE DID SEE SIGNIFICANT

02:38:27.431 --> 02:38:29.132
RAINFALL FORTUNATELY IN OUR

02:38:29.199 --> 02:38:30.634
WATER YEAR IN SOUTHERN

02:38:30.701 --> 02:38:33.537
CALIFORNIA- LAST WINTER JUST UP

02:38:33.604 --> 02:38:35.205
UNTIL A COUPLE MONTHS AGO EVEN

02:38:35.272 --> 02:38:37.007
WITH SOME RECORD RAINFALL. HERE

02:38:37.074 --> 02:38:39.643
IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY IN APRIL AS

02:38:39.710 --> 02:38:41.511
A RESULT- WE'RE NOT SEEING THE

02:38:41.578 --> 02:38:43.213
SAME LEVEL OF DROUGHT THAT IS

02:38:43.280 --> 02:38:45.082
CURRENTLY BEING EXPERIENCED IN

02:38:45.148 --> 02:38:46.683
SOME OF THE NORTHERN. PARTS OF

02:38:46.750 --> 02:38:48.852
THE STATE- AND BECAUSE OF THIS

02:38:48.919 --> 02:38:50.320
THE OFFICIAL FIRE AGENCY

02:38:50.387 --> 02:38:52.389
FORECAST RIGHT NOW ARE FOR

02:38:52.456 --> 02:38:54.691
BELOW NORMAL POTENTIAL FOR

02:38:54.758 --> 02:38:56.460
SIGNIFICANT FIRE ACTIVITIES

02:38:56.526 --> 02:38:59.196
THROUGH AUGUST. THAT SAD GRASS

02:38:59.263 --> 02:39:01.832
FIRES HAVE STARTED ACROSS OUR

02:39:01.899 --> 02:39:04.167
REGION WE HAD SEVERAL- JUST IN

02:39:04.234 --> 02:39:06.203
THE LAST FEW DAYS- THOUGH THEY

02:39:06.270 --> 02:39:08.505
ARE STILL SAYING SMALL. ALL

02:39:08.572 --> 02:39:10.774
THAT FAR BELOW TEN ACRES- IN

02:39:10.841 --> 02:39:12.242
THOSE ARE BEING BECAUSE JUST ON

02:39:12.309 --> 02:39:14.978
ROADSIDES AND- OTHER NORMAL DAY

02:39:15.045 --> 02:39:16.313
TO DAY ACTIVITY BUT WE DO

02:39:16.380 --> 02:39:17.781
EXPECT THOSE WILL INCREASE IN

02:39:17.848 --> 02:39:20.050
SIZE AND FREQUENCY AS WE HEAD

02:39:20.117 --> 02:39:22.119
THROUGH- THE UP COMING SUMMER

02:39:22.185 --> 02:39:24.087
MONTHS- AND THEN AS WE MOVE

02:39:24.154 --> 02:39:25.589
TOWARDS LATE IN THE SUMMER AND

02:39:25.656 --> 02:39:27.324
THE FALL. THAT IS WHEN WE

02:39:27.391 --> 02:39:29.459
EXPECT TO THAT ALL OF OUR FUELS

02:39:29.526 --> 02:39:31.695
WILL AGAIN BE VERY DRY AND WE

02:39:31.762 --> 02:39:34.665
ARE ANTICIPATING- RED FLAG

02:39:34.731 --> 02:39:38.602
WARNINGS AS WE HEAD INTO THIS

02:39:38.669 --> 02:39:42.406
FALL. SO AS WE- I'M WE ARE AD

02:39:42.472 --> 02:39:43.974
WE ARE AS PREPARED AS WE'VE

02:39:44.041 --> 02:39:45.375
EVER BEEN. WE HAVE BEEN AT THIS

02:39:45.442 --> 02:39:48.578
NOW FOR OVER A DECADE WHERE WE

02:39:48.645 --> 02:39:49.179
HAVE BEEN WORKING TO MITIGATE

02:39:49.246 --> 02:39:51.148
WILDFIRE REST ACROSS OUR

02:39:51.214 --> 02:39:54.418
TERRITORY AND OVER A DECADE AGO

02:39:54.484 --> 02:39:55.752
WE HAD AN APPROACH WHERE WE

02:39:55.819 --> 02:39:57.554
WOULD FOCUS ON FINDING THE

02:39:57.621 --> 02:39:59.756
HIGHEST RISK AREA OF OUR

02:39:59.823 --> 02:40:01.425
SERVICE TERRITORY. IN A LOT OF

02:40:01.491 --> 02:40:02.426
CASES THAT COULD BE OLDER

02:40:02.492 --> 02:40:05.128
INFRASTRUCTURE SOME HAD SMALLER

02:40:05.195 --> 02:40:07.531
WIRE AND BEING A METEOROLOGIST

02:40:07.597 --> 02:40:09.166
WE WOULD IDENTIFY THE WINDIEST

02:40:09.232 --> 02:40:11.134
AREAS AND WE WOULD HARDEN AT

02:40:11.201 --> 02:40:13.870
FIRST. THIS APPROACH HAS PROVEN

02:40:13.937 --> 02:40:16.440
SUCCESSFUL- ESSENTIAL TO THE

02:40:16.506 --> 02:40:18.875
SAFETY OF OUR REGION I MEAN WE

02:40:18.942 --> 02:40:20.744
CONTINUE THAT APPROACH TO THIS

02:40:20.811 --> 02:40:23.180
DAY- SO WORK NEW WILD FIRE

02:40:23.246 --> 02:40:24.614
MITIGATION PLANS HAVE A NEW

02:40:24.681 --> 02:40:26.283
RENEWED EFFORT. AND THIS IS

02:40:26.350 --> 02:40:29.119
REALLY TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE

02:40:29.186 --> 02:40:30.988
WITH TIME THE IMPACT THAT

02:40:31.054 --> 02:40:34.057
PUBLIC SAFETY OUR SHOPS- HAVE

02:40:34.124 --> 02:40:35.392
ON THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE

02:40:35.459 --> 02:40:37.160
SERVE. AND WE'RE DOING THAT IN

02:40:37.227 --> 02:40:39.963
A FEW DIFFERENT- WAYS IN WITH A

02:40:40.030 --> 02:40:44.034
NEW. SENSE OF PROGRAMS- ACROSS

02:40:44.101 --> 02:40:45.502
ONE MORE WEATHER STATIONS BUT

02:40:45.569 --> 02:40:47.304
ALL OF THOSE WEATHER STATIONS

02:40:47.371 --> 02:40:48.972
ARE COUPLED TO NEW SECTIONAL

02:40:49.039 --> 02:40:50.440
ICING DEVICES SO THAT WE CAN

02:40:50.507 --> 02:40:52.075
MAKE. PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT

02:40:52.142 --> 02:40:55.412
OFF SMALLER AND MORE TARGETED-

02:40:55.479 --> 02:40:57.748
WE ARE IMPLEMENTING MULTIPLE

02:40:57.814 --> 02:40:59.916
GENERATOR PROGRAMS. THOSE ARE

02:40:59.983 --> 02:41:01.918
WORKING ALONG WITH THE S. CHIP

02:41:01.985 --> 02:41:03.453
PROGRAM AND WE'RE TRYING TO

02:41:03.520 --> 02:41:05.322
TARGET FOLKS THAT ARE NOT ABLE.

02:41:05.389 --> 02:41:09.192
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT

02:41:09.259 --> 02:41:09.760
PROGRAM SO THAT WE CAN GET.

02:41:09.826 --> 02:41:10.627
STATE OF RATIONING THE HAN OF

02:41:10.694 --> 02:41:12.229
HIS OF OUR- IS ALSO. TO

02:41:12.295 --> 02:41:14.631
DECREASE THE IMPACT OF PUBLIC

SAFETY POWERSHOT OFFICE.

02:41:16.466 --> 02:41:18.602
MICROGRAPHS ARE BEING DEPLOYED

02:41:18.668 --> 02:41:21.371
IN VERY STRATEGIC AREAS ACROSS

02:41:21.438 --> 02:41:23.673
OUR BACK COUNTRY AND AGAIN THAT

02:41:23.740 --> 02:41:25.475
IS TO BRING POWER IN CHECK

02:41:25.542 --> 02:41:27.644
AREAS WHERE MAYBE THAT-

02:41:27.711 --> 02:41:29.346
CIRCUIT. RUNS THROUGH VERY

02:41:29.413 --> 02:41:31.415
STRONG WINDS TO GET THERE SO WE

02:41:31.481 --> 02:41:33.050
SECTION HONESTY AND IN THE NEWS

02:41:33.116 --> 02:41:35.052
MIKE REGRETS TO POWER THOSE

02:41:35.118 --> 02:41:37.220
AREAS. AND ALL OF THIS WORK IS

02:41:37.287 --> 02:41:40.624
HAVING AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT. ON

02:41:40.690 --> 02:41:42.793
WHAT WE ANTICIPATE WILL BE OUR

02:41:42.859 --> 02:41:46.363
P. S. P. S. IMPACT IN TWENTY

02:41:46.430 --> 02:41:47.230
TWENTY. OVER THE LAST SIX

02:41:47.297 --> 02:41:49.132
MONTHS SB JEANNIE BROUGHT

02:41:49.199 --> 02:41:50.567
TOGETHER A TEAM OF STOCK

02:41:50.634 --> 02:41:52.636
LEADERS ACROSS THE COMPANY USER

02:41:52.702 --> 02:41:54.838
LEADERS FROM FIRE SCIENCE TEAM

02:41:54.905 --> 02:41:56.573
FROM THE ENGINEERING TEAM. FROM

02:41:56.640 --> 02:41:58.608
THE CUSTOMER OUTREACH TEAM WERE

02:41:58.675 --> 02:41:59.743
ALL GETTING TOGETHER WITH A

02:41:59.810 --> 02:42:01.812
COMMON PURPOSE OF HOW DO WE

02:42:01.878 --> 02:42:03.780
MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF P. S. P.

02:42:03.847 --> 02:42:07.317
S. THIS YEAR. AND WE ARE

02:42:07.384 --> 02:42:10.020
IMPLEMENTING SOLUTIONS- IF WE

02:42:10.087 --> 02:42:11.922
SAW THE SAME WEATHER CONDITIONS

02:42:11.988 --> 02:42:14.724
THIS YEAR IN TWENTY TWENTY THAT

02:42:14.791 --> 02:42:15.959
WE SAW ARMED TWENTY NINETEEN.

02:42:16.026 --> 02:42:18.795
WE EXPECT ABOUT A 30% DECREASE

02:42:18.862 --> 02:42:20.997
IN THE AMOUNT OF CUSTOMERS THAT

02:42:21.064 --> 02:42:22.899
WOULD BE IMPACTED TO THIS YEAR.

02:42:22.966 --> 02:42:24.801
IN ADDITION TO THAT 30%

02:42:24.868 --> 02:42:27.337
DECREASE IN CUSTOMERS IMPACTED

02:42:27.404 --> 02:42:29.172
WE ALSO ARE ANTICIPATING IN THE

02:42:29.239 --> 02:42:31.575
SAME OF ACT SIX LAST SCHOOLS

02:42:31.641 --> 02:42:33.743
WOULD BE IMPACTED. THREE LAST

02:42:33.810 --> 02:42:37.314
FIRE STATIONS IN FORTY SEVEN.

02:42:37.380 --> 02:42:39.983
CAN SITES ALONG WITH SIX WATER

02:42:40.050 --> 02:42:42.519
FACILITIES- AND THAT'S JUST BY

02:42:42.586 --> 02:42:44.354
THE BEGINNING OF THIS UPCOMING

03:04:29.992 --> 03:04:31.493
EVERYONE TO LOOK THREE DOES.

03:04:31.560 --> 03:04:33.762
EVER SINCE. SEC KNOWLEDGES AND

03:04:33.829 --> 03:04:34.830
MANY OTHER PROGRAMS FROM WHAT I

03:04:34.897 --> 03:04:38.634
WANT TO TALK ABOUT. SOME OF THE

03:04:38.700 --> 03:04:39.234
CORE ONES HERE TODAY. THIS IS

03:04:39.301 --> 03:04:40.469
ALL BAY. AND PRESS. ON FOUNDER

03:04:40.536 --> 03:04:42.304
FOR THIS IS RISK MODELING. THAT

03:04:42.371 --> 03:04:43.772
WE USE TOOLS THAT WE HAVE THE

03:04:43.839 --> 03:04:45.207
TARGET AWHILE FARM RELATIONS

03:04:45.274 --> 03:04:46.909
EFFECTIVELY. AND TARGETS AND

03:04:46.975 --> 03:04:49.478
HELPS US- DECIDE WHAT THINGS TO

03:04:49.545 --> 03:04:51.246
DO FIRST. THESE TOOLS LEVERAGE

03:04:51.313 --> 03:04:53.148
MACHINE LEARNING. AND HIGH

03:04:53.215 --> 03:04:55.451
LEVEL DATA ANALYTICS- HELP US

03:04:55.517 --> 03:04:56.385
PREDICT THE PROBABILITY

03:04:56.452 --> 03:04:59.621
WITNESSES FOR EXAMPLE- WE ALSO

03:04:59.688 --> 03:05:00.189
LOOK AT THE WORLD HISTORICAL

03:05:00.255 --> 03:05:01.957
FIRE INFORMATION. AND WHAT WE

03:05:02.024 --> 03:05:03.125
EXPECT TO SEE AS A WILDFIRE

03:05:03.192 --> 03:05:05.160
CONSEQUENCE YOU MAY HAVE HEARD

03:05:05.227 --> 03:05:06.562
OF THE REACTS MODELING- THIS

03:05:06.628 --> 03:05:08.630
ENABLES MORE PRECISE. SWORD

03:05:08.697 --> 03:05:09.965
THIS IS OF ALL SIGNIFICANTLY

03:05:10.032 --> 03:05:11.333
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS.

03:05:11.400 --> 03:05:13.635
AND TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. AT

03:05:13.702 --> 03:05:16.405
ONE POINT. WE WERE TARGETING

03:05:16.472 --> 03:05:18.040
HIGH FIRE AREA MITIGATION SUCH

03:05:18.106 --> 03:05:20.142
AS COPPER CONDUCTOR. A CIRCUIT

03:05:20.209 --> 03:05:22.110
LEVEL. SERVICE MAY BE SEVERAL

03:05:22.177 --> 03:05:24.413
MILES. OF MILES. WE NOW TURN IT.

03:05:24.480 --> 03:05:27.149
ON SPAN. SPANS OF. THREE

03:05:27.216 --> 03:05:27.816
HUNDRED FEET. SO MUCH MORE

03:05:27.883 --> 03:05:32.988
PRECISION AND WHEN WE DEPLOY.

03:05:33.055 --> 03:05:33.622
THESE RISK MITIGATION. ANOTHER

03:05:33.689 --> 03:05:35.057
EXAMPLE YOU RISK. RISK

03:05:35.123 --> 03:05:38.293
ANALYTICS. WE'RE DOING IS ARTS.

03:05:38.360 --> 03:05:39.394
USUALLY OUT LAST YEAR WE

03:05:39.461 --> 03:05:43.899
INSPECT 1% OR AND HIGH RISKY.

03:05:43.966 --> 03:05:44.433
NOW WE THOUGHT THERE WAS A

03:05:44.500 --> 03:05:46.502
BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD A COPPER IS

03:05:46.568 --> 03:05:47.669
OUTSIDE OF THE ROUTINE

03:05:47.736 --> 03:05:48.837
INSPECTIONS THAT WE HAVE DONE

03:05:48.904 --> 03:05:51.073
HISTORICALLY AND THOSE THAT

03:05:51.139 --> 03:05:51.607
WE'VE AUGMENTED FOR FIRE

03:05:51.673 --> 03:05:54.409
PREVENTION. OVER THE HISTORY OF

03:05:54.476 --> 03:05:56.745
OUR OPERATIONS. THIS YEAR WE'RE

03:05:56.812 --> 03:05:57.813
GOING TO DO IS TARGET THE

03:05:57.880 --> 03:05:59.548
HIGHEST RISK CIRCUITS THAT ARE

03:05:59.615 --> 03:06:01.183
IN THAT CATEGORY I'M GOING TO

03:06:01.250 --> 03:06:03.185
DO THAT BOTH ON THE GROUND AND

03:06:03.252 --> 03:06:04.820
IN THE AIR USING DRONES

03:06:04.887 --> 03:06:06.355
HELICOPTERS. NOW WHAT THIS

03:06:06.421 --> 03:06:08.056
MEANS IS FOR COMPLIANCE

03:06:08.123 --> 03:06:09.858
PURPOSES IN THE PAST

03:06:09.925 --> 03:06:11.493
DISTRIBUTION EQUIPMENT WOULD BE

03:06:11.560 --> 03:06:12.928
INSPECTED EVERY FIVE YEARS

03:06:12.995 --> 03:06:14.830
TRANSMISSIONS WOMEN WOULD BE

03:06:14.897 --> 03:06:16.231
INSPECTED EVERY THREE YEARS.

03:06:16.298 --> 03:06:17.699
THIS HIGH RISK OF WHAT WE

03:06:17.766 --> 03:06:19.935
EXPECTED EVERY YEAR AND NOW ON

03:06:20.002 --> 03:06:21.970
THE GROUND AND BY AIR THIS IS A

03:06:22.037 --> 03:06:23.005
TREMENDOUS STEP UP IN THE

03:06:23.071 --> 03:06:23.906
AMOUNT OF INSPECTIONS WERE

03:06:23.972 --> 03:06:25.641
DOING AT THE DATA WERE SO YOU

03:06:25.707 --> 03:06:28.176
HELP US TO. BETTER MEDICATIONS

03:06:28.243 --> 03:06:31.280
AND MORE EFFECTIVE THE SPS

03:06:31.346 --> 03:06:32.447
DEPLOYMENT. NOT A TECH FRONT AS

03:06:32.514 --> 03:06:35.083
HE DEPLOYING. TO DETECT FAULTS

03:06:35.150 --> 03:06:36.752
BEFORE THEY OCCUR. DISTRIBUTION

03:06:36.818 --> 03:06:39.354
FALLS. ANTICIPATION FOR EXAMPLE

03:06:39.421 --> 03:06:41.223
IS USING DATA ANALYTICS TO

03:06:41.290 --> 03:06:43.025
PROTECT FALLS. IN ADVANCE OF

03:06:43.091 --> 03:06:44.259
THEIR OCCURRENCE BASED ON

03:06:44.326 --> 03:06:45.494
SIGNATURES WERE SEEING ON THE

03:06:45.561 --> 03:06:47.529
LINES AND TAKE ACTION BEFORE

03:06:47.596 --> 03:06:49.164
THEY OCCUR. OTHER WORDS FOR

03:06:49.231 --> 03:06:51.433
SMOKERS. WHEN YOU DO THAT AGAIN

03:06:51.500 --> 03:06:52.467
YOU'RE REDUCING THE CHANCES

03:06:52.534 --> 03:06:54.436
FIRES AND EVEN IMPROVING THE

03:06:54.503 --> 03:06:57.873
OPERATIONS OR SYSTEM. DURING

03:06:57.940 --> 03:06:59.074
PSP S. OFFENSE. DOWNTURN OF

03:06:59.141 --> 03:06:59.841
INFRASTRUCTURE HARDENING WE

03:06:59.908 --> 03:07:01.543
CONTINUE REFINE AND TARGET

03:07:01.610 --> 03:07:03.512
SECTIONAL ICING AS A KEY

03:07:03.579 --> 03:07:05.380
COMPONENT OF OUR PROGRAM.

03:07:05.447 --> 03:07:06.715
ESTARá CLEAN THIS IS BEEN A

03:07:06.782 --> 03:07:08.650
CORE ELEMENT OF OUR GREAT

03:07:08.717 --> 03:07:10.452
MONETIZATION ELEMENTS IT HAS

03:07:10.519 --> 03:07:13.021
BOTH RELIABILITY PS PS.

03:07:13.088 --> 03:07:14.723
BENEFITS TO US SO WE'VE BEEN

03:07:14.790 --> 03:07:16.391
DOING THIS FOR YEARS BUT IT'S

03:07:16.458 --> 03:07:17.693
STILL A PROGRAM WE'RE TARGETING

03:07:17.759 --> 03:07:18.894
MORE MORE OF IT BASED ON

03:07:18.961 --> 03:07:20.429
LEARNING THAT WE'RE SEEING FROM

03:07:20.495 --> 03:07:24.433
PSP SSETS. THAT CONTINUES TO

03:07:24.499 --> 03:07:25.834
BE A CAR OR PROGRAM. BUT OUR

03:07:25.901 --> 03:07:27.836
PROGRAM THE MORBIDITY TO AS A

03:07:27.903 --> 03:07:28.837
CORE ELEMENT OF OUR

03:07:28.904 --> 03:07:31.006
INFRASTRUCTURE HARDING IS COVER

03:07:31.073 --> 03:07:32.507
CONDUCTOR INSULATION NOW OVER

03:07:32.574 --> 03:07:35.277
THE LAST TWO YEARS INSTALL FIVE

03:07:35.344 --> 03:07:36.712
HUNDRED MILES OF THIS BUT WE'RE

03:07:36.778 --> 03:07:38.313
TARGETING SEVEN HUNDRED MILES

03:07:38.380 --> 03:07:39.915
FOR THIS YEAR WITH THE REST OF

03:07:39.982 --> 03:07:41.483
TARGETED FORTY FIVE HUNDRED

03:07:41.550 --> 03:07:43.685
MILES OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS

03:07:43.752 --> 03:07:45.687
THAT AGAIN THIS ELIMINATES THE

03:07:45.754 --> 03:07:48.590
REST OF MOST- EMISSIONS FROM

03:07:48.657 --> 03:07:49.424
OUR LINES AND IT'S VERY COST

03:07:49.491 --> 03:07:51.326
EFFECTIVE I'M USING A RISK

03:07:51.393 --> 03:07:53.395
ANALYTICS TO TARGET THE HIGHEST

03:07:53.462 --> 03:07:56.765
RISK SEGMENTS OUR SYSTEM. IN

03:07:56.832 --> 03:07:58.133
OUR FOCUSED ON COST EFFECTIVE

03:07:58.200 --> 03:08:00.569
SOLUTIONS LIKE COVER CONDUCTOR.

03:08:00.636 --> 03:08:01.737
WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT

03:08:01.803 --> 03:08:03.839
UNDERGROUND AS A MEANS OF

03:08:03.905 --> 03:08:05.307
REDUCING RISK FROM WILDFIRES

03:08:05.374 --> 03:08:07.275
ARE LOOKING SELECTIVE CRITERIA

03:08:07.342 --> 03:08:09.344
THINGS SUCH AS EXCESSIVE P. SPS

03:08:09.411 --> 03:08:11.213
ADVANCE ONLINE OR LIMITED

03:08:11.279 --> 03:08:13.582
EGRESS. IN A CERTAIN AREAS WERE

03:08:13.649 --> 03:08:14.616
UNDER BROWN IS A BETTER

03:08:14.683 --> 03:08:16.184
SOLUTION AND WE'LL MOVE

03:08:16.251 --> 03:08:17.886
FORWARD. AND WE'RE DOING

03:08:17.953 --> 03:08:19.855
ANALYTICS AND MANY FOR SOME

03:08:19.921 --> 03:08:22.357
SEGMENTS HONOR CIRCUIT FOR

03:08:22.424 --> 03:08:23.592
DEPLOYMENT TWENTY TWENTY ONE.

03:08:23.659 --> 03:08:28.030
NOW FOR A MORE- IT'S A

03:08:28.096 --> 03:08:30.065
TRADITIONALLY- VEGETATION

03:08:30.132 --> 03:08:31.233
MANAGEMENT IS STILL KEY COURSE

03:08:31.299 --> 03:08:32.801
OF OUR PROGRAM AS WE LOOK AT

03:08:32.868 --> 03:08:34.302
SOURCES OF IGNITIONS

03:08:34.369 --> 03:08:35.704
PREDOMINANTLY FOR SOUTHERN

03:08:35.771 --> 03:08:37.239
CALIFORNIA EDISON THERE WHEN

03:08:37.305 --> 03:08:38.473
OBJECTS COME INTO CONTACT WITH

03:08:38.540 --> 03:08:39.908
OUR LINES SOME OF THOSE ARE

03:08:39.975 --> 03:08:42.277
VEGETATION SO INCREASING OUR

03:08:42.344 --> 03:08:44.413
CLEARANCES AND REMOVING TREES

03:08:44.479 --> 03:08:45.380
WHO A NEW PROGRAM THAT WE

03:08:45.447 --> 03:08:46.648
DEVELOP THE LAST COUPLE OF

03:08:46.715 --> 03:08:48.183
YEARS WHICH IS A HAZARD TREE

03:08:48.250 --> 03:08:50.018
MANAGER PROGRAM REDUCING THE

03:08:50.085 --> 03:08:51.586
THREAT OF IGNITIONS ALSO

03:08:51.653 --> 03:08:54.923
CREATING BASICALLY- FIRE BREAKS

03:08:54.990 --> 03:08:56.224
AROUND OUR POLLS COUPLE HOLD

03:08:56.291 --> 03:08:58.527
CLEARING BRUSH SO THAT'S A

03:08:58.593 --> 03:08:59.828
PROGRAM WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY

03:08:59.895 --> 03:09:04.032
RAMPED UP TO REDUCE THE CHANCES.

03:09:04.099 --> 03:09:05.600
OF OUR EQUIPMENT BECAUSE YOU.

MODELING OUR WEATHER MODELING

03:09:31.893 --> 03:09:33.195
HELP US MAKE GOOD DECISIONS

03:09:33.261 --> 03:09:34.262
BOTH ON WHERE WE DEPLOY

03:09:34.329 --> 03:09:35.797
INFRASTRUCTURES. AN IMPORTANT

03:09:35.864 --> 03:09:37.432
FOR THIS PROCEEDING HOW WE

03:09:37.499 --> 03:09:39.401
DECIDE WHEN AND HOW AND HOW

AETOLIAN A REGULATOR IS

03:09:57.152 --> 03:09:59.454
CRITICAL. NOW WILL LEAD TO AN

PROTECTING CUSTOMERS FROM

03:10:05.727 --> 03:10:07.796
UNNECESSARY COSTS THE END OF

03:10:07.863 --> 03:10:09.397
THE DAY BECAUSE OUR OBJECTIVES

03:10:09.464 --> 03:10:11.066
SO YOU FOR LIBEL AND AFFORDABLE

HIGHER RISK. AT THE SAME TIME.

03:10:15.137 --> 03:10:16.037
AND WE'VE BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT

03:10:16.104 --> 03:10:17.839
OF WILD FIRE MITIGATION FOR

03:10:17.906 --> 03:10:19.374
MANY YEARS NOW. NOW AFTER THE

OF TODAY. BUT AT THAT TIME FOR

03:10:32.854 --> 03:10:34.489
THOSE WERE DEVELOPED WE DECIDED

03:10:34.556 --> 03:10:36.158
WE NEEDED TO MOVE EXPEDITIOUSLY

03:10:36.224 --> 03:10:37.359
TO REDUCE THE THREAT OF

03:10:37.425 --> 03:10:39.494
WILDFIRES ON OUR LIVES. THIS IS

03:10:39.561 --> 03:10:40.462
WHAT LED TO THE INITIAL

03:10:40.529 --> 03:10:42.130
DEPLOYMENT OF COVER CONDUCTOR

03:10:42.197 --> 03:10:43.665

URGENCY OUR SENSE OF MISSION.

03:10:52.240 --> 03:10:54.776
THIS REALLY IS JOB ONE FOR

ALL RIGHT I'D LIKE TO BE A TO

04:04:52.978 --> 04:04:55.981
TALK ABOUT- TECHNO SILVA- AND

04:04:56.048 --> 04:04:58.283
I'LL PARAPHRASE HERE IN PLEASE

04:04:58.350 --> 04:05:00.218
FISH FACT ME IF YOU THINK MY

04:05:00.285 --> 04:05:02.254
PARAPHRASING IS INCORRECT BUT-

04:05:02.320 --> 04:05:04.022
BRINGING ON A NEW CONSULTANT.

04:05:04.089 --> 04:05:05.791
WHO WORKS WITH OTHER UTILITIES

04:05:05.857 --> 04:05:07.626
AND ALSO WORKS WITH CAL FIRE TO

04:05:07.692 --> 04:05:10.562
BE ABLE TO PREDICT- FIRE

04:05:10.629 --> 04:05:13.265
BEHAVIOR. AND WHAT A POTENTIAL

04:05:13.331 --> 04:05:15.033
SPARK NAY BE BASED OFF OF THE

04:05:15.100 --> 04:05:17.869
WEATHER CONDITIONS THE TERRAIN-

04:05:17.936 --> 04:05:19.871
AND- WHERE YOU WOULD SEE THAT

04:05:19.938 --> 04:05:22.607
POTENTIAL FIRE IF IT WAS CAUSED

04:05:22.674 --> 04:05:24.342
BY UTILITY. HOW MUCH IS THIS

04:05:24.409 --> 04:05:25.811
GOING TO PLAY INTO YOUR

04:05:25.877 --> 04:05:28.313
PREDICTING WHEN IT COMES THE IN

04:05:28.380 --> 04:05:30.715
THIS MODELING INTO SHUTTING OFF

04:05:30.782 --> 04:05:32.884
COMMUNITIES THIS NEW MODELING.

04:05:32.951 --> 04:05:34.386
THE COMPANY NOW THAT YOU'RE IN

04:05:34.453 --> 04:05:36.388
CONTRACT WITH WHAT HOUSE IS

04:05:36.455 --> 04:05:37.556
GOING TO CHANGE THE GAME

04:05:37.622 --> 04:05:40.225
COMPARED TO LAST YEAR. THANK

04:05:40.292 --> 04:05:43.161
YOU. I THINK IT'S RATHER TECHNO

04:05:43.228 --> 04:05:46.398
SILVA IN OUR FOR CASTING

04:05:46.465 --> 04:05:48.700
CAPABILITIES FOR EVENTS LAST

04:05:48.767 --> 04:05:51.503
YEAR WE HAD IF YOU THINK ABOUT

04:05:51.570 --> 04:05:52.704
A COMPUTER SCREEN AND YOU THINK

04:05:52.771 --> 04:05:54.606
ABOUT ALL OF THE PIXELS IN THIS

04:05:54.673 --> 04:05:56.241
COMPUTER SCREEN THINK ABOUT

04:05:56.308 --> 04:05:57.709
THAT ACROSS OUR SERVICE

04:05:57.776 --> 04:05:59.978
TERRITORY. LAST YEAR OUR CORE

04:06:00.045 --> 04:06:02.581
CASTING CAPABILITY WAS IN THREE

04:06:02.647 --> 04:06:05.050
BY THREE CLIMATE- PIXELS SO

04:06:05.117 --> 04:06:07.419
ABOUT NINE SQUARE KILOMETERS-

04:06:07.486 --> 04:06:09.754
THE ADVANCEMENT THAT WE HAVE

04:06:09.821 --> 04:06:12.357
UNDERTAKEN IN OUR MODELING

04:06:12.424 --> 04:06:14.126
CAPABILITIES WHICH INCLUDES

04:06:14.192 --> 04:06:16.862
TECHNO SILVA- AMERI CORPS

04:06:16.928 --> 04:06:20.565
CREATING AND OUR SYSTEMS WERE

04:06:20.632 --> 04:06:21.133
ALREADY STARTING TO SEE THE

04:06:21.199 --> 04:06:25.470
STOCK. TWO BY TWO. SO OUR

04:06:25.537 --> 04:06:28.273
ABILITY TO I'M MORE ACTUALLY

04:06:28.340 --> 04:06:30.175
FOR THE WEATHER IN AS THEY

04:06:30.242 --> 04:06:34.579
PERTAIN TO OUR OUR RED IS

04:06:34.646 --> 04:06:36.615
SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED OVER

04:06:36.681 --> 04:06:40.919
LAST YEAR. SO I'M GONNA ASK YOU

04:06:40.986 --> 04:06:43.188
TO HELP TO FIND THAT OUT SO FOR

04:06:43.255 --> 04:06:44.356
ISOLATE PEOPLE WHAT IS THAT

04:06:44.422 --> 04:06:46.057
MEAN AND WHAT CAN WE EXPECT IN

04:06:46.124 --> 04:06:51.530
REGARDS TO THE FORECASTING.

04:06:51.596 --> 04:06:52.564
WHAT THAT MEANS IS ARE

04:06:52.631 --> 04:06:55.033
FORECASTING IS ABOUT 0% MORE

04:06:55.100 --> 04:06:58.303
PRECISE THAN IT WAS LAST YEAR.

04:06:58.370 --> 04:07:01.973
AND IS OUR ABILITY TO- FOR CAPS

04:07:02.040 --> 04:07:04.176
THOSE WEATHER CONDITIONS WITH

04:07:04.242 --> 04:07:07.412
IN- THE GEOGRAPHY OF OUR

04:07:07.479 --> 04:07:09.114
TRANSMISSION SYSTEMS AND OUR

04:07:09.181 --> 04:07:11.349
DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS THIS IS

04:07:11.416 --> 04:07:14.186
GOING TO BE MORE ACCURATE. AND

04:07:14.252 --> 04:07:16.421
WHAT THAT ALLOW US TO DO IS

04:07:16.488 --> 04:07:18.623
START THE ENTIRE SCOPE OF THE

04:07:18.690 --> 04:07:22.294
ANY BANDS. SMALLER THAT'S

04:07:22.360 --> 04:07:24.396
EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING TO HELP US

04:07:24.462 --> 04:07:26.431
MAKE THE EVENTS SMALLER AND

04:07:26.498 --> 04:07:28.366
THAT'S THAT STARTS FROM DAY ONE

04:07:28.433 --> 04:07:30.869
WITH THE FORECAST. I'D LIKE TO

04:07:30.936 --> 04:07:33.205
JUMP TO THE ISSUE OF THE NORTH

04:07:33.271 --> 04:07:35.674
COAST AND THE CHALLENGES THAT

04:07:35.740 --> 04:07:37.642
WE SAW. LAST YEAR I

04:07:37.709 --> 04:07:39.978
UNDERSTANDING- ABOUT WHAT

04:07:40.045 --> 04:07:40.845
YOU'RE SAYING IN REGARDS TO

04:07:40.912 --> 04:07:43.648
DAYLIGHT HOURS IN GETTING-

04:07:43.715 --> 04:07:45.917
COMMUNITIES BACK UP AND RUNNING

04:07:45.984 --> 04:07:48.353
IN A QUICKER TIME PERIOD. SO

04:07:48.420 --> 04:07:49.554
THERE WERE SOME COMMUNITIES

04:07:49.621 --> 04:07:52.224
THAT WERE OFF BETWEEN TEN AND

04:07:52.290 --> 04:07:54.292
FOURTEEN DAYS BECAUSE ONE POWER

04:07:54.359 --> 04:07:58.630
SHUT OFF. BLOOD INTO ANOTHER.

04:07:58.697 --> 04:08:00.765
CAN YOU MAKE A COMMITMENT TO

04:08:00.832 --> 04:08:02.534
YOUR SERVICE TERRITORY TODAY

04:08:02.601 --> 04:08:03.735
THAT THAT WON'T HAPPEN THAT

04:08:03.802 --> 04:08:06.571
YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO AVOID

04:08:06.638 --> 04:08:09.641
THOSE DOUBLE WHAMMY POWER SHUT

04:08:09.708 --> 04:08:11.376
OFFS WHERE ONE BELIEVES IN TO

04:08:11.443 --> 04:08:12.944
ANOTHER AND I AND I I'M

04:08:13.011 --> 04:08:16.181
SPEAKING SELFISHLY BECAUSE-

04:08:16.248 --> 04:08:18.450
LAKE MENDOCINO CINEMA IN A

04:08:18.516 --> 04:08:20.285
SMALL PART OF MARINE ALSOP

04:08:20.352 --> 04:08:22.487
ANYWHERE BETWEEN TEN AND

04:08:22.554 --> 04:08:24.623
FOURTEEN DAY POWER SHUT OFF CAN

04:08:24.689 --> 04:08:26.658
YOU MAKE SOME ASSURANCES THAT

04:08:26.725 --> 04:08:29.361
THAT WON'T HAPPEN THIS YEAR.

04:08:29.427 --> 04:08:31.997
SEC THAT'S TOUGH. BECAUSE THAT

04:08:32.063 --> 04:08:34.699
WAS DRIVEN BY THE WEATHER

04:08:34.766 --> 04:08:39.571
EVENTS WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS-

04:08:39.638 --> 04:08:41.539
ONCE WE HAVE THE ALL CLEAR.

04:08:41.606 --> 04:08:44.376
FROM THE WEATHER EVENT WE HAVE

04:08:44.442 --> 04:08:46.478
THE HELICOPTER SO THEY MENTION

04:08:46.544 --> 04:08:48.546
WE HAVE THE SIX STRING WING

04:08:48.613 --> 04:08:50.348
AIRCRAFT THAT I MENTIONED. WHO

04:08:50.415 --> 04:08:52.617
CAN THEN CONTROL THE LINES I

04:08:52.684 --> 04:08:55.453
UNDERSTAND WE HAVE ISSUES THAT

04:08:55.520 --> 04:08:57.155
NEED TO BE CORRECTED BEFORE WE

04:08:57.222 --> 04:08:58.490
CAN RETURN CUSTOMERS THE

04:08:58.556 --> 04:09:00.792
SERVICE. WHAT I WOULD ALSO

04:09:00.859 --> 04:09:03.528
MENTION IS THAT- VERY IMPACTFUL

04:09:03.595 --> 04:09:04.896
SO THE NORTHERN COAST LAST

04:09:04.963 --> 04:09:06.431
YEAR- AND SOMETHING THAT WE

04:09:06.498 --> 04:09:09.167
CHANGE THIS YEAR AS WE HAVE-

04:09:09.234 --> 04:09:10.902
ENABLED THE HUMBOLDT BAY

04:09:10.969 --> 04:09:15.440
GENERATING. STATION ISLAND. I

04:09:15.507 --> 04:09:16.541
IN CAPE OF EVEN THOUGH THERE

04:09:16.608 --> 04:09:19.311
MAYBE TRANSMISSION IN PACKS UP

04:09:19.377 --> 04:09:21.413
AWAY FROM THE COAST LINE THAT

04:09:21.479 --> 04:09:23.615
AFFECTS THAT AREA. THE HOME

04:09:23.682 --> 04:09:25.083
WILL BE GENERATING STATION WILL

04:09:25.150 --> 04:09:28.353
BE ABLE THE ISLAND AND- MANY OF

04:09:28.420 --> 04:09:33.024
OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR. SO

04:09:33.091 --> 04:09:34.592
THERE'S STILL A POSSIBILITY

04:09:34.659 --> 04:09:37.996
THAT WE MAY SEE. THE WIND POWER

04:09:38.063 --> 04:09:39.764
SHUT OFF BLEEDING TO ANOTHER

04:09:39.831 --> 04:09:41.599
THIS YEAR OBVIOUSLY- WHAT I'M

04:09:41.666 --> 04:09:43.201
HEARING YOU SAY IS YOU NEVER

04:09:43.268 --> 04:09:45.403
WANT THAT TO HAPPEN BUT THERE'S

04:09:45.470 --> 04:09:49.708
STILL POTENTIAL FOR THAT. I

04:09:49.774 --> 04:09:51.176
GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING IS WE

04:09:51.242 --> 04:09:52.644
DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN WE

04:09:52.711 --> 04:09:54.746
HAVE PLANS FOR THAT NOT HAPPEN

04:09:54.813 --> 04:09:56.548
BUT WE CANNOT CONTROL THE SPEED

04:09:56.614 --> 04:09:58.016
AT WHICH THE WEATHER FRIENDS

04:09:58.083 --> 04:10:04.155
COME THROUGH. SO I PROMISE JUST

04:10:04.222 --> 04:10:06.424
HERE JUST TWO MORE QUESTIONS SO

04:10:06.491 --> 04:10:08.493
A FOLLOW UP ON THAT SO CAN YOU

04:10:08.560 --> 04:10:12.330
GO A LITTLE DEEPER ON IF WE-

04:10:12.397 --> 04:10:13.865
ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE WE'RE

04:10:13.932 --> 04:10:15.400
LOOKING AT AN EXTENDED POWER

04:10:15.467 --> 04:10:19.170
SHUT OFF. THE EXPENSE TO

04:10:19.237 --> 04:10:19.738
BUSINESS THE CHALLENGES TO

04:10:19.804 --> 04:10:21.840
SCHOOLS- I CAN KEEP GOING DOWN

04:10:21.906 --> 04:10:24.676
THE LINE ABOUT COMPENSATION FOR

04:10:24.743 --> 04:10:31.049
CUSTOMERS ON THAT. CAN I ASK

04:10:31.116 --> 04:10:32.083
FOR CLARIFICATION WHAT YOU'RE

04:10:32.150 --> 04:10:34.119
ASKING THE MY QUESTION IS IF

04:10:34.185 --> 04:10:36.921
WE'RE LOOKING AT OF A POTENTIAL

04:10:36.988 --> 04:10:38.223
TEN TO FOURTEEN DAY. SHUT OFF

04:10:38.289 --> 04:10:41.459
WHICH- I'LL BE HONEST WE CAN'T

04:10:41.526 --> 04:10:43.561
HAVE ANOTHER TWO WEEK SHUT OFF

04:10:43.628 --> 04:10:46.631
IN THE STATE AIDES WERE IN

04:10:46.698 --> 04:10:47.232
TWENTY TWENTY IT'S SIMPLY NOT

04:10:47.298 --> 04:10:49.634
ACCEPTABLE. SHOULD CUSTOMERS

04:10:49.701 --> 04:10:50.969
WHAT CUSTOMERS HAVE THE ABILITY

04:10:51.035 --> 04:10:52.170
TO BE A RECOUP THEIR BUSINESS

04:10:52.237 --> 04:10:55.440
LOST THEIR FOOD LOS EXEDRA. AND

04:10:55.507 --> 04:10:57.208
AS WE MOVE FORWARD HERE INTO

04:10:57.275 --> 04:11:00.845
POWER SHUT OFF SEASON. I'M YEAH

04:11:00.912 --> 04:11:02.781
WE RECOGNIZE THE HARD JUSTICE

04:11:02.847 --> 04:11:04.949
CAUSED BY BEING WITHOUT POWER

04:11:05.016 --> 04:11:07.051
WE ALSO LIVE IN OUR

04:11:07.118 --> 04:11:09.654
COMMUNITIES. HOWEVER I CAN'T

04:11:09.721 --> 04:11:11.289
STRESS ENOUGH THAT PSCS IS

04:11:11.356 --> 04:11:13.291
DRIVEN BY SAFETY AND PROTECTION

04:11:13.358 --> 04:11:15.427
OF OUR COMMUNITIES FOR TRAFFIC

04:11:15.493 --> 04:11:17.962
WILD FIRES. BEGIN WE UNDERSTAND

04:11:18.029 --> 04:11:19.731
THE HARDSHIP DISCUSSES AND AS

04:11:19.798 --> 04:11:21.132
SUCH WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE

04:11:21.199 --> 04:11:24.969
CAN TO LIMIT ITS IMPACT. TO OUR

04:11:25.036 --> 04:11:28.440
POPULATIONS. OKAY FOR YOU KNOW

04:11:28.506 --> 04:11:30.074
GETTING ANSWER THAT ONE THAT'S

04:11:30.141 --> 04:11:31.142
THAT'S FINE SO I THINK THAT

04:11:31.209 --> 04:11:32.710
LOOK I HEAR YOU IN REGARDS TO

04:11:32.777 --> 04:11:34.712
POWER SHUT OFF IS BASED OFF OF

04:11:34.779 --> 04:11:37.081
SAFETY. AND BY THE WAY HIS PAL

04:11:37.148 --> 04:11:38.917
BUT PLEASE DON'T DIRECT MY

04:11:38.983 --> 04:11:40.118
DON'T DON'T TAKE MY COMMENTS

04:11:40.185 --> 04:11:41.653
BEING DIRECTED TO YOU MISS

04:11:41.719 --> 04:11:43.521
POWERS BEEN MORE THAN GRACIOUS

04:11:43.588 --> 04:11:45.523
IN HER TIME- SITTING DOWN

04:11:45.590 --> 04:11:46.891
ANSWERING QUESTIONS AND TRULY

04:11:46.958 --> 04:11:48.993
GRATEFUL AND WHOEVER IS IN NET

04:11:49.060 --> 04:11:50.295
SEAT HAS AN INCREDIBLY

04:11:50.361 --> 04:11:52.263
CHALLENGING JOB. IT'S BEEN A

04:11:52.330 --> 04:11:54.265
CULTURE AT THE UTILITY THIS IS

04:11:54.332 --> 04:11:56.734
NOT A MISS PALS FAULT.

04:11:56.801 --> 04:11:57.936
UNDERSTANDING SHE IS A VERY

04:11:58.002 --> 04:11:59.204
DIFFICULT JOB NOW THAT WHERE

04:11:59.270 --> 04:12:00.505
SHE IS NOW IN FRONT OF THE

04:12:00.572 --> 04:12:01.573
COMMITTEE HAVE AN ANSWER BUT I

THAT ISSUE OF. YES THIS IS A

04:12:06.511 --> 04:12:08.480
SAFETY ISSUE BUT LET'S BE

04:12:08.546 --> 04:12:10.548
CANDID THIS CORPORATION IS

04:12:10.615 --> 04:12:12.550
BEHIND IN HAS BEEN BEHIND IN

04:12:12.617 --> 04:12:13.751
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND

04:12:13.818 --> 04:12:15.420
SPECIALIZATION IN DEVELOPING

04:12:15.487 --> 04:12:16.921
TEMPORARY MICHAEL GRADES. THIS

04:12:16.988 --> 04:12:18.189
WAS USES A BLUNT INSTRUMENT

04:12:18.256 --> 04:12:19.424
LAST YEAR BECAUSE THERE IS NO

04:12:19.491 --> 04:12:21.025
OTHER TO WHEN YOU'RE TO ABOUT

04:12:21.092 --> 04:12:22.026
BECAUSE THE CORPORATION HAD

04:12:22.093 --> 04:12:24.863
FALLEN BEHIND YEARS YEARS AND

04:12:24.929 --> 04:12:26.431
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN KEEPING

04:12:26.498 --> 04:12:28.399
THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE MODERNIZE

04:12:28.466 --> 04:12:31.236
IN SAFE SO. WE CAN CONTINUE TO

04:12:31.302 --> 04:12:33.071
SAY THIS IS A SAFETY-

04:12:33.137 --> 04:12:34.873
INSTRUMENT AND AT THE SAME TIME

04:12:34.939 --> 04:12:36.708
THOUGH BUT NORTH CALIFORNIA

04:12:36.774 --> 04:12:37.642
RESIDENTS WITH FOR YOUR

04:12:37.709 --> 04:12:39.043
CUSTOMERS REPEATING THESE

04:12:39.110 --> 04:12:42.247
CUSTOMERS ARE. FEELING NEGATIVE

04:12:42.313 --> 04:12:43.648
IMPACTS BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF
