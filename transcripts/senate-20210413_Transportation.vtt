00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:13.650
WILL. CONTRIBUTE TO A FOR LIVE

00:54:13.717 --> 00:54:15.986
AT EVER INCREASING AMOUNT OF

00:54:16.052 --> 00:54:18.088
MICROPLASTICS OUT IN THE- IN

00:54:18.154 --> 00:54:20.123
THE IN A WATER STREAM. AND SO

00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:21.024
THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT

00:54:21.091 --> 00:54:22.292
THE OCEANPROTECTION COUNCIL

00:54:22.359 --> 00:54:24.094
WHICH WOULD WOULD LOOK AT. AND

00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:25.128
I ALSO THINK THEY WOULD THEY

00:54:25.195 --> 00:54:26.696
WOULD YOU KNOW THE OTHER ISSUE

00:54:26.763 --> 00:54:28.765
I JUST WANNA I WANNA REYES. IS

00:54:28.832 --> 00:54:30.300
MAKING SURE THAT THIS REALLY

00:54:30.367 --> 00:54:32.435
DOES MEET YOUR GOALS OF TRYING

00:54:32.502 --> 00:54:35.472
TO.ENCOURAGE RECYCLING. AND

00:54:35.538 --> 00:54:39.709
AND- YEAH GOOD DOWNSTREAM USES-

00:54:39.776 --> 00:54:40.644
THE WE DON'T WANT TO DO

00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:42.479
SOMETHING THAT WILL ACT RESUME

00:54:42.545 --> 00:54:44.147
AND I PRESUME I WOULD. YEAH I

00:54:44.214 --> 00:54:45.181
PRESUME YOU WOULD AGREE TO

00:54:45.248 --> 00:54:47.317
THIS- CENTER WESO. I THAT WE

00:54:47.384 --> 00:54:47.984
DON'T WANT TO DO SOMETHING THAT

00:54:48.051 --> 00:54:49.719
WILL ACTUALLY. MAKE IT LESS

00:54:49.786 --> 00:54:53.590
LIKELY FOR- FOR HOW HE WAS.

00:54:53.657 --> 00:54:55.592
PLASTICS TO BE TURNED INTO.

00:54:55.659 --> 00:54:57.494
SOMETHING AND THAT THERE WOULD

00:54:57.560 --> 00:54:59.129
BE A HIGHER AND BETTER USE.

00:54:59.195 --> 00:55:01.431
THAN A ROAD SO. YOU KNOW I'D

00:55:01.498 --> 00:55:02.399
LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU MOVING

00:55:02.465 --> 00:55:04.267
FORWARD I THINK I REALLY

00:55:04.334 --> 00:55:05.935
APPRECIATE YOUR- YOUR

00:55:06.002 --> 00:55:06.603
WILLINGNESS TO INCLUDE THE

00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:07.771
OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL IN

00:55:07.837 --> 00:55:08.872
THIS ANALYSIS I THINK IT'S A

00:55:08.938 --> 00:55:09.939
CRITICAL. ADDITIONAL

00:55:10.006 --> 00:55:12.142
PERSPECTIVE- ALONG WITH

00:55:12.208 --> 00:55:15.045
CALTRANS. AND TO TAKE INTO

00:55:15.111 --> 00:55:16.246
ACCOUNT THE SIGNIFICANT

00:55:16.312 --> 00:55:17.847
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AT PLAY

00:55:17.914 --> 00:55:19.749
HERE I ALSO RECOGNIZE IT'S A

00:55:19.816 --> 00:55:20.283
STUDY IN THIS IS JUST AN

00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:23.053
OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO. TO LOOK

00:55:23.119 --> 00:55:24.220
AT THIS ISSUE AND TRY TO FIGURE

00:55:24.287 --> 00:55:25.622
OUT IF THERE'S A GOOD PATH

00:55:25.689 --> 00:55:27.290
MOVING FORWARD THAT WILL. BOTH

00:55:27.357 --> 00:55:28.925
HELP US WITH REGARDS TO ROADS

00:55:28.992 --> 00:55:30.827
INFRASTRUCTURE AND ALSO. WITH

00:55:30.894 --> 00:55:32.862
REGARDS TO. REDUCING PLASTICS

00:55:32.929 --> 00:55:35.331
POLLUTION IN WITH THAT- SO I

00:55:35.398 --> 00:55:36.366
APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND

00:55:36.433 --> 00:55:38.234
WITH THAT AND IN THAT SPIRIT IN

00:55:38.301 --> 00:55:40.003
WITHOUT AGREEMENT I'M I'M SO

00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:40.837
HAPPY TO. SUPPORT THE BILL

00:55:40.904 --> 00:55:45.308
TODAY. THANK. YOU SENATOR ALAN

00:55:45.375 --> 00:55:46.776
SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU

00:55:46.843 --> 00:55:48.111
MADAM CHAIR AND ONE OF CREATE

00:55:48.178 --> 00:55:50.213
THE CAR. OF MY ARE. TWO

00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:51.948
PREVIOUS COLLEAGUES WHO SPOKE.

00:55:52.015 --> 00:55:54.484
IN BUT ALSO APPRECIATE SENATOR

00:55:54.551 --> 00:55:57.487
HUESO IS- RAISING OF THIS ISSUE

00:55:57.554 --> 00:56:03.493
THAT. WE DO HAVE. A WAY TOO

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:06.463
MANY PLASTICS AND- WE ARE NOT

00:56:06.529 --> 00:56:08.732
ABLE TO RECYCLE THEM. FOR MANY

00:56:08.798 --> 00:56:10.433
MANY REASONS I WON'T GET INTO

00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:16.306
NOW. SO WE DO NEED TO. ADDRESS

00:56:16.372 --> 00:56:18.241
THIS ISSUE AND OF COURSE THE

00:56:18.308 --> 00:56:19.976
REDUCTION IN THE USE OF

00:56:20.043 --> 00:56:20.877
PLASTICS WOULD BE THE FIRST AND

00:56:20.944 --> 00:56:23.980
FOREMOST- HOWEVER THAT'S

00:56:24.047 --> 00:56:25.215
OBVIOUSLY OTHER BILLS THAT WE

00:56:25.281 --> 00:56:26.349
HAVE TO CONSIDER BUT WHAT I

00:56:26.416 --> 00:56:28.118
WANT TO RAISE IS SIMILAR TO MY

00:56:28.184 --> 00:56:29.886
COLLEAGUES THE CONCERN AROUND

00:56:29.953 --> 00:56:34.157
MICROPLASTICS. AND WHILE I DO

00:56:34.224 --> 00:56:36.960
NOT OPPOSE THE USE OF PLASTICS

00:56:37.026 --> 00:56:37.861
AND ROADS AND WILL SUPPORT THE

00:56:37.927 --> 00:56:41.064
BILL THE STUDY THE LANGUAGE IN

00:56:41.131 --> 00:56:43.633
THE BILL RIGHT NOW HAS CALTRANS

00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:45.935
LOOKING AT THE ENVIRONMENTAL

00:56:46.002 --> 00:56:48.805
BENEFITS OF THE USE AND WHAT MY

00:56:48.872 --> 00:56:51.474
CONCERN IS BY THAT DEFINITION

00:56:51.541 --> 00:56:54.511
ALONE THEY MAY NOT INCLUDE IN

00:56:54.577 --> 00:56:58.348
THEIR STUDY. WHAT POSSIBLE-

00:56:58.414 --> 00:57:00.683
DETRIMENTAL IMPACTS MAY BE THE

00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:03.720
REASON I RAISE IT IS. WE KNOW

00:57:03.787 --> 00:57:07.056
NOW THAT WILL JUST WITHOUT EVEN

00:57:07.123 --> 00:57:08.858
IT'S OBVIOUS THAT NGUYEN TIRES

00:57:08.925 --> 00:57:10.426
RUN ON ROADS THE FRICTION

00:57:10.493 --> 00:57:11.861
BETWEEN THE TIRE AND THE ROADS

00:57:11.928 --> 00:57:13.930
BREAKS UP THE ROAD. BUT WHAT WE

00:57:13.997 --> 00:57:17.500
KNOW NOW IS THAT THEY LOOK GOOD

00:57:17.567 --> 00:57:18.968
PERCENT OF PARTICULATE MATTER.

00:57:19.035 --> 00:57:21.371
IN CALIFORNIA IS IN OUR AREA

00:57:21.437 --> 00:57:23.640
THAT AFFECTS OUR WHICH IS PART

00:57:23.706 --> 00:57:26.509
OF THE- COMPONENT OF SMOG. SO

00:57:26.576 --> 00:57:27.977
IN PARTICULAR MATTER IS ONE OF

00:57:28.044 --> 00:57:29.913
THE DANGEROUS HEALTHWISE

00:57:29.979 --> 00:57:31.881
COMPONENTS OF SMART THAT A GOOD

00:57:31.948 --> 00:57:33.049
PORTION OF THAT PARTICULAR

00:57:33.116 --> 00:57:35.685
MATTER COMES FROM JUST TIRES

00:57:35.752 --> 00:57:38.188
RUNNING ON ROADWAYS BREAKING UP

00:57:38.254 --> 00:57:39.189
BOTH THE TIRES IN THE ROADWAY.

00:57:39.255 --> 00:57:43.493
OUR MICROPLASTICS ALREADY ARE

00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:45.662
FEATURED IN ALL OF THIS THE

00:57:45.728 --> 00:57:46.963
THERE WERE GRAD STUDENTS AT THE

00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:48.231
UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA THE

00:57:48.298 --> 00:57:50.300
PUBLISHED A STUDY JUST LAST

00:57:50.366 --> 00:57:52.202
AUGUST AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY.

00:57:52.268 --> 00:57:54.604
WHERE THEY SAMPLED A LARGE

00:57:54.671 --> 00:57:56.539
ARRAY AND VERY PEOPLE IT PASSED

00:57:56.606 --> 00:57:59.943
AWAY OF- HUMAN ORGANS. AND THEY

00:58:00.009 --> 00:58:01.711
FOUND THEY DETECTED

00:58:01.778 --> 00:58:04.447
MICROPLASTICS IN EVERY ORGAN

00:58:04.514 --> 00:58:09.185
FOR EVERY. HUMAN THAT DAY.

00:58:09.252 --> 00:58:12.088
START THERE WAS 1100% SO

00:58:12.155 --> 00:58:13.623
MICROPLASTICS NOW ARE QUITE

00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:16.392
UBIQUITOUS WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND

00:58:16.459 --> 00:58:17.827
THE LONG TERM HEALTH IMPACTS OF

00:58:17.894 --> 00:58:20.997
THEM AND IF THE USE OF THEM

00:58:21.064 --> 00:58:23.266
USED PLASTICS IN ROADWAYS WORD

00:58:23.333 --> 00:58:25.201
BECAUSE MORE MICROPLASTICS TO

00:58:25.268 --> 00:58:27.370
BECOME AIRBORNE THAT COULD BE A

00:58:27.437 --> 00:58:30.740
SERIOUS ISSUE. SO WHAT I WOULD

00:58:30.807 --> 00:58:33.076
APPRECIATE IS HAPPENING. WITHIN

00:58:33.142 --> 00:58:35.011
THE STUDY THAT THEY ALSO LOOK

00:58:35.078 --> 00:58:37.380
AT WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT POSSIBLE

00:58:37.447 --> 00:58:38.014
DETRIMENTAL IMPACTS THERE MIGHT

00:58:38.081 --> 00:58:41.117
BE. BECAUSE IT CERTAINLY YOU

00:58:41.184 --> 00:58:42.352
CAN LOOK AT WHETHER THEY'RE

00:58:42.418 --> 00:58:45.255
VIABLE FOR. THE YOU KNOW

00:58:45.321 --> 00:58:46.756
STRUCTURE AND STRENGTH OF

00:58:46.823 --> 00:58:48.658
ROADWAY BUT I THINK IT ALSO

00:58:48.725 --> 00:58:51.060
SHOULD LOOK AT THAT ASPECT. AND

00:58:51.127 --> 00:58:53.129
HOPE THAT THE AUTHOR WITH AGREE

00:58:53.196 --> 00:58:55.131
WITH- ADDING SOMETHING LIKE

00:58:55.198 --> 00:58:56.900
THAT AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD

00:58:56.966 --> 00:58:57.934
THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER

00:58:58.001 --> 00:58:59.602
SENATOR- WHAT'S THAT WOULD YOU

00:58:59.669 --> 00:59:00.570
LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT IN YOUR

00:59:00.637 --> 00:59:04.240
CLOTHES. YES FOR NOW OKAY

00:59:04.307 --> 00:59:05.675
ABSOLUTELY SENATOR RUBIO. THANK

00:59:05.742 --> 00:59:07.877
YOU MADAM CHAIR- I ALSO WANT TO

00:59:07.944 --> 00:59:09.646
COMMIT THE AUTHOR NOT ONLY FOR.

00:59:09.712 --> 00:59:11.481
BEING INNOVATIVE BUT TAKING THE

00:59:11.547 --> 00:59:13.583
STUDENTS ADVICE I WAS ALSO

00:59:13.650 --> 00:59:15.118
STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT TINA IS

00:59:15.184 --> 00:59:16.386
A FORMER EDUCATOR I'M ALWAYS

00:59:16.452 --> 00:59:17.787
ENCOURAGE WHEN WE GET OUR YOUTH

00:59:17.854 --> 00:59:20.089
INVOLVED SELF. SILVA THANK YOU

00:59:20.156 --> 00:59:21.057
FOR TO THE STUDENTS WHO REALLY

00:59:21.124 --> 00:59:23.459
TAKE THIS INITIATIVE AND- INTO

00:59:23.526 --> 00:59:24.961
THE GREAT CENTER FROM SAN DIEGO

00:59:25.028 --> 00:59:26.496
FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I DO

00:59:26.562 --> 00:59:28.598
HAVE. SOME CONCERNS JUST LIKE

00:59:28.665 --> 00:59:30.099
EVERYONE ELSE BUT I THINK THAT

00:59:30.166 --> 00:59:32.068
THROUGH THE DISCUSSION IT

00:59:32.135 --> 00:59:34.537
SATISFIED SOME OF THE CONCERNS-

00:59:34.604 --> 00:59:35.805
YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THE FACT

00:59:35.872 --> 00:59:36.506
THAT WE DO HAVE THE OCEAN

00:59:36.572 --> 00:59:37.974
PROTECTION COUNCIL INVOLVED

00:59:38.041 --> 00:59:39.742
ALONG WITH CALTRANS. I JUST

00:59:39.809 --> 00:59:41.544
THINK THIS IS A GOOD WAY TO

00:59:41.611 --> 00:59:44.147
STUDY SOMETHING AND SEE IF THIS

00:59:44.213 --> 00:59:46.082
HAS ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS LONG

00:59:46.149 --> 00:59:48.318
TERM. I THINK THAT THROUGH THE

00:59:48.384 --> 00:59:49.485
STATE HE WILL FIND OUT IF IT'S

00:59:49.552 --> 00:59:51.187
FEASIBLE OR NOT AND THEN MOVE

00:59:51.254 --> 00:59:53.289
FORWARD WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE

00:59:53.356 --> 00:59:54.657
TO SUPPORT THE BILL AND ALSO BE

00:59:54.724 --> 00:59:58.895
ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR THANK YOU.

ECHO SOME OF THE CONCERNS MY

01:00:13.643 --> 01:00:14.911
COLLEAGUES AROUND MICROPLASTICS

01:00:14.978 --> 01:00:15.912
IS SOMETHING I'VE RECENTLY

01:00:15.979 --> 01:00:18.247
BECOME AWARE OF AND FOCUSED ON

01:00:18.314 --> 01:00:20.850
AS WELL AS THE ISSUE OF YOU

01:00:20.917 --> 01:00:22.618
KNOW THE EFFECTS THE FACTS ON

01:00:22.685 --> 01:00:23.953
PLASTIC RECYCLING GENERALLY

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:25.188
WANT TO MAKE SURE THE HIGHLY

01:00:25.254 --> 01:00:26.889
RECYCLABLE PLASTICS YOU END UP.

01:00:26.956 --> 01:00:29.726
IN THERE- IN IN THEIR BEST USE-

01:00:29.792 --> 01:00:31.027
BUT WITH THE YOU KNOW HEALTH

01:00:31.094 --> 01:00:33.830
CONCERNS NOTED HERE TODAY I

01:00:33.896 --> 01:00:34.397
WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL

AND MANY OF YOU ARE SURROUNDED

01:01:03.393 --> 01:01:05.128
BY PLASTIC. IN THIS MEETING

01:01:05.194 --> 01:01:07.964
IT'S REALLY HARD TO. ENGAGE ANY

01:01:08.031 --> 01:01:09.632
PART OF OUR COMMUNITY WITHOUT A

01:01:09.699 --> 01:01:13.436
COMING- INTO FIRSTHAND. A

01:01:13.503 --> 01:01:15.338
CONTACT WITH PLASTIC IN ALMOST

01:01:15.405 --> 01:01:17.106
EVERY PART OF OUR LIVES PLASTIC

01:01:17.173 --> 01:01:19.442
IS REALLY BECOME. JUST A LOW

THINK IS A IS A VERY PRACTICAL

01:01:54.944 --> 01:01:57.213
APPROACH TO REMOVE THIS

01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:59.248
MATERIAL FROM THE ENVIRONMENT

01:01:59.315 --> 01:02:01.517

YOU KNOW WHAT A CONTINUING

01:02:02.618 --> 01:02:04.020
PROBLEM CALIFORNIA'S BECAUSE

01:02:04.087 --> 01:02:05.388
THE GROWING NEED FOR LANDFILLS

RECYCLE MORE BUT WE NEED A

01:02:10.426 --> 01:02:11.861
PLACE TO PUT PLASTIC IS

01:02:11.928 --> 01:02:14.097

01:02:14.163 --> 01:02:16.099
WORLD DEVELOPMENTS USED

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:18.835
CALIFORNIA STILL STRUGGLING

01:02:18.901 --> 01:02:21.404
WITH MORE WORK WHERE TO PUT OUR

01:02:21.471 --> 01:02:23.439
CLASSROOM MATERIALS. BUT I. I

01:02:23.506 --> 01:02:25.575
BELIEVE THAT- IN IN CONDUCTING

01:02:25.641 --> 01:02:26.976
A TUDY IT AND NEEDS TO BE

01:02:27.043 --> 01:02:29.312
TRULY SCIENTIFIC IS IT NEEDS TO

01:02:29.378 --> 01:02:31.047
BE TRULY INFORMATIVE. AND I

01:02:31.114 --> 01:02:32.782
WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING

01:02:32.849 --> 01:02:33.716
WITH MY COLLEAGUES TO MAKE SURE

01:02:33.783 --> 01:02:35.685
THE STUDY IS. INFORMATIVE IT

01:02:35.751 --> 01:02:38.588
IS- HELPFUL IN DETERMINING

01:02:38.654 --> 01:02:41.224
WHETHER THE USE OF THIS PLASTIC

01:02:41.290 --> 01:02:42.558
MATERIAL ON OUR ROADWAYS IS

01:02:42.625 --> 01:02:43.993
GOING TO BE. THE BEST WAY TO

01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:46.762

01:02:53.202 --> 01:02:56.005
AND LOTS OF PROBLEMS WORLDWIDE

01:02:56.072 --> 01:02:57.807
SO CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO LIKE

BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY.

01:20:37.199 --> 01:20:40.936

HEALTH IMPACTS OF THAT

01:20:52.581 --> 01:20:54.749
POLLUTION IN CALIFORNIA STILL

01:20:54.816 --> 01:20:56.651

BUT I THINK- IT'S UNFAIR TO

01:21:30.352 --> 01:21:31.419
GIVE AN EXCEPTION TO THIS

01:21:31.486 --> 01:21:33.054

WAYS TO TRAVEL WE OPPOSE THIS

01:38:50.157 --> 01:38:51.525

01:38:51.592 --> 01:38:54.194
AWAY A MAJOR STATE INVESTMENT

01:39:04.738 --> 01:39:07.574
IN THE STATE GIVEN THAT CONTEXT

01:39:07.641 --> 01:39:09.843
HOW ON EARTH DOES IT MAKE SENSE

01:39:09.910 --> 01:39:11.512
TO RIP OUT THE RAILS IN THE

USE THE RAILS IN THE FUTURE THE

01:39:23.557 --> 01:39:25.059

01:39:32.333 --> 01:39:33.967
THE BILL PROPOSES RAIL BANKING

01:39:34.034 --> 01:39:35.936

HAVE OUR COASTLINE THAT IS-

01:58:42.748 --> 01:58:43.749
THREATENED BY RISING SEA

01:58:43.816 --> 01:58:46.018
LEVELS. AND OF COURSE WE HAVE-

01:58:46.085 --> 01:58:47.420
LARGE PARTS ARE DISTRICT THAT

ARE ON THE VERGE OF- A EACH ON

01:58:50.823 --> 01:58:52.358
THE PERIPHERY OF WILDFIRES

INCLUDING MY HOMETOWN IRVINE

01:58:54.360 --> 01:58:56.429
WHICH- CAME VERY VERY CLOSE TO

01:58:56.496 --> 01:58:57.630
BEING. HAVING PARTS OF IT

01:58:57.697 --> 01:59:00.299
BURNED DOWN THIS PAST- WINTER

01:59:00.366 --> 01:59:01.634
OUR CARS AND TRUCKS ACCOUNT FOR

APPROXIMATELY ONE FIFTH OF ALL

01:59:02.935 --> 01:59:05.137
U. S. EMISSIONS AND OUR MAJOR

01:59:05.204 --> 01:59:06.973
CONTRIBUTOR CALIFORNIA'S-

01:59:07.039 --> 01:59:08.875
GREENHOUSE GASES-

01:59:08.941 --> 01:59:10.543
TRANSPORTATION IS RESPONSIBLE

01:59:10.610 --> 01:59:12.178
FOR HALF OF ALL OF OUR STATES

01:59:12.245 --> 01:59:14.080
CARBON POLLUTION. AND SO I'M

01:59:14.146 --> 01:59:16.549
GRATEFUL TO SEE ALL OF THE

01:59:16.616 --> 01:59:19.519
EXCITING AND DECISIVE EFFORTS

01:59:19.585 --> 01:59:24.524
TO TRY TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE.

01:59:24.590 --> 01:59:25.124
BUT I WOULD NOTE THAT THE RISE

01:59:25.191 --> 01:59:25.791
OF THE TIME MISS VEHICLES PULL.

01:59:25.858 --> 01:59:27.527
A C. RISK CITIES OF GOALS- I

01:59:27.593 --> 01:59:29.161
THINK I WE SEE. WITH THE RISE

01:59:29.228 --> 01:59:31.964
OF WISHES. OF RIDE SHARING. AS

01:59:32.031 --> 01:59:32.932
WELL AS SOME OF THE INITIAL

01:59:32.999 --> 01:59:34.800
ESTIMATES ADONIS VEHICLES ARE

01:59:34.867 --> 01:59:36.802
ESTIMATED TO ADD AS MUCH AS SIX

01:59:36.869 --> 01:59:38.504
TIMES- THE VEHICLE MILES

01:59:38.571 --> 01:59:41.474
TRAVELED PER VEHICLE- AND SO IT

01:59:41.541 --> 01:59:42.775
IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE

01:59:42.842 --> 01:59:44.143
GET THIS RIGHT AT THE OUTSET

01:59:44.210 --> 01:59:46.245
THAT WE SET STANDARDS- THAT

01:59:46.312 --> 01:59:48.648
REQUIRE THAT. A THOMAS VEHICLES

01:59:48.714 --> 01:59:51.317
B. HE SAYS- AND I DON'T THINK

01:59:51.384 --> 01:59:53.019
THIS IS TOO FAR OF A STRETCH AS

01:59:53.085 --> 01:59:54.954
WE KNOW. THERE ARE PLENTY OF

01:59:55.021 --> 01:59:56.389
XAMPP OPTIONS AVAILABLE RIGHT

01:59:56.455 --> 01:59:58.291
NOW- AND THEY'LL BE PLENTY MORE

01:59:58.357 --> 02:00:00.026
AVAILABLE BY THE BEGINNING OF

02:00:00.092 --> 02:00:01.694
TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN- A TIMELESS

02:00:01.761 --> 02:00:04.096
VEHICLES- CAN OF COURSE THIS

02:00:04.163 --> 02:00:05.865
SOFTWARE FOR THESE CAN BE.

02:00:05.932 --> 02:00:07.934
FITTED TO VARIOUS TYPES OF

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.136
HARDWARE VERY FEW OF THE TIME

02:00:10.202 --> 02:00:10.603
TO BE CALLED SOFTWARE

02:00:10.670 --> 02:00:12.438
DEVELOPERS. ARE DEVELOPING

02:00:12.505 --> 02:00:15.575
THEIR OWN CARS- SO- WE KNOW

02:00:15.641 --> 02:00:17.009
THAT. WHEN THERE'S ELECTRIC

02:00:17.076 --> 02:00:18.344
VEHICLES HYDROGEN THERE'S

02:00:18.411 --> 02:00:20.580
PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITIES TO

SUSTAINABLE PART OF OUR

02:02:08.888 --> 02:02:10.122
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. FOR

02:02:10.189 --> 02:02:11.824
EXAMPLE RESEARCH FROM UC DAVIS

02:02:11.891 --> 02:02:13.259
FOUND THAT PERSONALLY OWNED

02:02:13.325 --> 02:02:14.694
EIGHTIES ARE LIKELY TO

02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:15.828
SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE VEHICLE

02:02:15.895 --> 02:02:17.329
MILES TRAVELED WITH A LARGE

02:02:17.396 --> 02:02:18.731
PORTION OF THOSE MILES COMING

02:02:18.798 --> 02:02:19.598
WITH NO PASSENGERS IN THE

02:02:19.665 --> 02:02:21.701
VEHICLE. THEY ALSO FOUND EIGHT

02:02:21.767 --> 02:02:23.936
EITHER LIKELY TO SHIFT PEOPLE

02:02:24.003 --> 02:02:25.538
AWAY FROM LOWER EMISSION KNOWS.

02:02:25.604 --> 02:02:27.573
YES YES RESEARCH SHOWS THE

02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:28.474
POTENTIAL FOR EIGHTY TO

02:02:28.541 --> 02:02:30.643
INCREASE- BOTH GREENHOUSE GAS

EMISSIONS AND AIR POLLUTION.

02:02:32.478 --> 02:02:34.647
EVEN IN A SCENARIO WHERE

02:02:34.714 --> 02:02:35.247
POLICIES ENCOURAGE PULLING IN

02:02:35.314 --> 02:02:36.982
TRANSIT. OUR RESEARCH ALSO

02:02:37.049 --> 02:02:38.784
FOUND THAT NEGATIVE IMPACTS

02:02:38.851 --> 02:02:40.286
CONGESTION AIR POLLUTION WERE

02:02:40.352 --> 02:02:40.853
LIKELY TO HAPPEN

02:02:40.920 --> 02:02:41.987
DISPROPORTIONATELY IN

02:02:42.054 --> 02:02:43.189

EXPERIENCING ENVIRONMENTAL

02:02:43.889 --> 02:02:46.192
INJUSTICES. WE CAN ALSO LEARN

02:02:46.258 --> 02:02:47.293
FROM THE RAPID DEPLOYMENT OF

02:02:47.359 --> 02:02:49.295
RIDE HAILING WHICH UCS AND

02:02:49.361 --> 02:02:50.930
HARPER HAVE BOTH SOUNDS TO

02:02:50.996 --> 02:02:51.564
INCREASE EMISSIONS COMPARED TO

02:02:51.630 --> 02:02:54.066
PERSONAL CARS. ACCORDING TO UCS

02:02:54.133 --> 02:02:54.767
ANALYSIS THE AVERAGE RIDE

02:02:54.834 --> 02:02:57.336
HAILING TRIPS IS 69% MORE

02:02:57.403 --> 02:02:57.970
POLLUTING THAN THE TRAINS THEY

02:02:58.037 --> 02:02:59.939
REPLACE. REPORTS AND OTHERS

02:03:00.005 --> 02:03:01.207
HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED TO DEPLOY

02:03:01.273 --> 02:03:02.942
EIGHTIES AT THAT IN ORDER TO

02:03:03.008 --> 02:03:04.710
MITIGATE EMISSIONS IMPACT. PART

02:03:04.777 --> 02:03:07.713
OF A BROADER STRATEGY TO REDUCE

02:03:07.780 --> 02:03:08.347
EMISSIONS FROM TRANSPORTATION.

WE TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY THOSE

02:18:16.221 --> 02:18:17.589
SAME CONCERNS THE GOAL HERE IS

02:18:17.656 --> 02:18:19.991
NOT IN P. THE ROLLOUT OF USEFUL

02:18:20.058 --> 02:18:23.061
TECHNOLOGY- BUT RATHER TO SHARE

02:18:23.128 --> 02:18:24.496
THIS WITH A ANOTHER EMERGING

02:18:24.562 --> 02:18:26.665
TECHNOLOGY- WE ARE TO

02:18:26.731 --> 02:18:28.867
CROSSROADS RIGHT NOW WHERE. THE

02:18:28.933 --> 02:18:31.503
DEPLOYMENT OF AV'S IS GOING TO

02:18:31.569 --> 02:18:32.971

SEPARATE FROM THAT BUT AS TO

02:18:39.044 --> 02:18:40.879
THE PARTICULAR IS CONCERNED- WE

02:18:40.945 --> 02:18:42.247
HAVE CARVED OUT A DIFFERENCE

02:18:42.313 --> 02:18:43.982
BETWEEN DEPLOYMENT AND TESTING

02:18:44.049 --> 02:18:45.750
SO ALL THESE COMPANIES ARE

02:18:45.817 --> 02:18:47.318
ALLOWED TO TEST ON WHATEVER

02:18:47.385 --> 02:18:48.286

REQUIRING THE DEPLOYMENT BE

02:18:53.692 --> 02:18:55.727
LIMITED TO SAYS- IT THIS POINT

02:18:55.794 --> 02:18:56.961
WHILE THERE ARE GENERALIZED

02:18:57.028 --> 02:18:58.463
CONCERNS WE'VE HEARD ABOUT-

02:18:58.530 --> 02:18:59.431
INCLUDING SOME OF THE COMMENTS

02:18:59.497 --> 02:19:01.266
TODAY ABOUT HOW THIS MIGHT

02:19:01.332 --> 02:19:03.001
HINDER. DEPLOYMENT WE'VE NOT

02:19:03.068 --> 02:19:04.803
ACTUALLY HEARD ANY SPECIFIED

02:19:04.869 --> 02:19:07.038
EXAMPLES- AND THAT'S YOU KNOW

02:19:07.105 --> 02:19:07.739
SOMETHING THAT I WOULD BE

02:19:07.806 --> 02:19:08.940
INTERESTED IN SEEING AS HIS

02:19:09.007 --> 02:19:11.509
DATE OF A I GUESS MY- HALFWAY

02:19:11.576 --> 02:19:12.877
INFORMED BELIEVE THAT I'D LIKE

02:19:12.944 --> 02:19:14.579
TO SORT OF LEARN MORE ABOUT-

02:19:14.646 --> 02:19:16.581
EAST IS THAT THERE'S NO REASON

02:19:16.648 --> 02:19:19.284
WE CAN'T DEPLOY. WITHOUT

02:19:19.350 --> 02:19:21.419
IMPEDING ANY KIND LINES- THAT

02:19:21.486 --> 02:19:22.620
RIGHT NOW HOLD UP ON THE

02:19:22.687 --> 02:19:23.888
DEPLOYMENT OF AV'S ACROSS THE

02:19:23.955 --> 02:19:25.390
STATE IS NOT BECAUSE OF THE

02:19:25.457 --> 02:19:26.691
HARDWARE THAT IS TO SAY IT'S

02:19:26.758 --> 02:19:28.760
NOT BECAUSE OF A LACK OF THEM.

02:19:28.827 --> 02:19:30.562
IT'S RATHER BECAUSE THEY'RE

02:19:30.628 --> 02:19:31.362
STILL WORKING WITH THE

02:19:31.429 --> 02:19:33.465
SOFTWARE- IN SO AT THIS POINT

02:19:33.531 --> 02:19:34.999
THERE'S ONLY BEEN ONE COMPANY

02:19:35.066 --> 02:19:36.768

THIS BILL HAS NOT YET PASSED

02:19:41.039 --> 02:19:42.907

BABIES ROLE THAT REALLY AYE I

02:19:45.643 --> 02:19:47.245

02:19:47.312 --> 02:19:50.014
IS HAVE. AND I ARGUE THESE HAVE

02:19:50.081 --> 02:19:51.649
ARE MUCH FURTHER ALONG AS FAR

02:19:51.716 --> 02:19:52.784
AS BEING A NASCENT TECHNOLOGY

02:19:52.851 --> 02:19:54.018
THAT'S REALLY HITTING THE

02:19:54.085 --> 02:19:57.055
MARKET AND AV'S- SO AGAIN WHAT

02:19:57.122 --> 02:19:58.757

OBJECTIVE. IS ON V. M. T. SOME

02:22:39.784 --> 02:22:40.718

NOT CERTAINLY AT THAT MOST IS

02:22:54.866 --> 02:22:56.434
NOT CLEAR AND IT IT'S PAST MAY

02:22:56.501 --> 02:22:58.269

WHY NOT ALLOW. AT THE END OF.

02:23:18.656 --> 02:23:19.123
DEADLINE WE THE GOVERNOR

SUGGESTED ORDER DEADLINE. IS

02:23:23.194 --> 02:23:24.762
THAT A QUESTION FOR ME YES

02:23:24.829 --> 02:23:27.065
THAT'S CORRECT I FOR. THAT I

02:23:27.131 --> 02:23:28.366
THINK THAT THE ANSWER IS THE A

02:23:28.433 --> 02:23:30.001
TON OF ARE SUBS OF VARIOUS

02:23:30.068 --> 02:23:31.736
SUBSET AT THIS POINT OF OVER

02:23:31.803 --> 02:23:33.771
VEHICLE RIGHT. IF YOU LOOK AT

02:23:33.838 --> 02:23:34.772
GM FOR AND TOYOTA NEW WITH

02:23:34.839 --> 02:23:37.175
THEIR BUILDING- THERE ON TO PER.

02:23:37.241 --> 02:23:38.009
YOU KNOW A HUNDRED. OF THEIR

02:23:38.076 --> 02:23:40.044
FOR TO BE ELECTRIC VEHICLE OR-

02:23:40.111 --> 02:23:41.779
I SOME POINT ON THE CALL. IN

02:23:41.846 --> 02:23:43.715
NEXT TEN TO FIFTEEN. APART THAT

02:23:43.781 --> 02:23:45.283
RESPONSE CALIFORNIA. PART

02:23:45.350 --> 02:23:48.219
THAT'S RESPONSE MARKET- BUT AS

02:23:48.286 --> 02:23:50.521
FAR AS A VIS- YOU KNOW I DON'T

02:23:50.588 --> 02:23:52.423
SEE I GUESS I FOR FLIP THAT

02:23:52.490 --> 02:23:53.691
WHAT'S THE ARGUMENT FOR NOT

02:23:53.758 --> 02:23:55.360
HAVING A VIS. WHICH MAY OR MAY

02:23:55.426 --> 02:23:56.494
NOT AYE AYE AGAIN THE STUDY

02:23:56.561 --> 02:23:57.562
THAT HAVE BEEN OUT THERE

02:23:57.628 --> 02:23:59.697
STRONGLY. THAT WE'RE GOING TO

02:23:59.764 --> 02:24:01.232
SEE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE. IN

02:24:01.299 --> 02:24:02.934
VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED PASSING

02:24:03.001 --> 02:24:06.037
VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED- AND SO

02:24:06.104 --> 02:24:08.573
THIS IS A NEW TECHNOLOGY AND I

02:24:08.639 --> 02:24:09.574
GUESS THE QUESTION IS. IT'S A

02:24:09.640 --> 02:24:10.942
IT'S IN THE WAY I LOOK AT IS

02:24:11.009 --> 02:24:12.643
IT'S DIFFERENT THAN THE

02:24:12.710 --> 02:24:13.811
EXISTING CARS THAT ARE BEING

02:24:13.878 --> 02:24:15.013
MANUFACTURED IN PLACES LIKE

02:24:15.079 --> 02:24:16.881
DETROIT. AND SOUTH CAROLINA IN

02:24:16.948 --> 02:24:19.884
JAPAN. WHY NOT REQUIRE THIS TO

02:24:19.951 --> 02:24:21.886
HAVE THE TO BE SEVENTH OUTSIDE

02:24:21.953 --> 02:24:22.954
BECAUSE IT'S A BRAND NEW

02:24:23.021 --> 02:24:24.489
TECHNOLOGY IT'S BEING ROLLED

02:24:24.555 --> 02:24:26.290
OUT VERY SLOWLY WE'RE BEING

02:24:26.357 --> 02:24:27.625
CAUTIOUS AND THOUGHTFUL ABOUT

02:24:27.692 --> 02:24:28.793
HOW WE'RE DEPLOYING THIS. AND I

02:24:28.860 --> 02:24:30.261
THINK THIS IS FULLY CONSISTENT

02:24:30.328 --> 02:24:32.230
WITH THE SAME REASONING. BEHIND

02:24:32.296 --> 02:24:33.598
OUR OTHER AMBITIOUS CLIMATE

02:24:33.664 --> 02:24:35.500
GOALS AND SO I GUESS I JUST

02:24:35.566 --> 02:24:37.802
RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THE

02:24:37.869 --> 02:24:38.369
PREMISE THAT QUESTION I JUST

02:24:38.436 --> 02:24:39.370
THINK THAT. YEAH THIS IS A NEW

02:24:39.437 --> 02:24:40.938
TECHNOLOGY I AS I SAID EARLIER

02:24:41.005 --> 02:24:43.107
I THINK IT'S A GOOD ARGUMENT TO

02:24:43.174 --> 02:24:45.043
BE MADE. IT'S ACTUALLY TRAILING

02:24:45.109 --> 02:24:48.079
BEHIND XSAN SO WHY NOT HAVE

02:24:48.146 --> 02:24:49.414
ALL THE TIME IN THIS VEHICLES.

02:24:49.480 --> 02:24:51.182
BE REQUIRED TO ALSO BE IS AS I

02:24:51.249 --> 02:24:52.750
THINK IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE AS

02:24:52.817 --> 02:24:54.318
POLICY AND WE CAN MANDATE BY

02:24:54.385 --> 02:25:03.094
THE WAY THAT ALL CARS. TODAY

02:25:03.161 --> 02:25:05.696
WHAT IF WE- BOTTOM OF THE WAS A

02:25:05.763 --> 02:25:06.664
BRAND NEW TO. I THINK WE ARE.

02:25:06.731 --> 02:25:07.465
GOOD ARE. THAT I. SHOULD ALSO A

02:25:07.532 --> 02:25:09.033
GRASS. FOR TO BE. POSITIVE

02:25:09.100 --> 02:25:10.201
SINCE REMOVING THAT DIRECTION

02:25:10.268 --> 02:25:10.868
OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT OF

02:25:10.935 --> 02:25:13.204
COURSE. WE HAVE A

02:25:13.271 --> 02:25:15.139
INFRASTRUCTURE AROUND PUMP GAS.

02:25:15.206 --> 02:25:16.707
ON WILL BE. WE MANY. LINE AND

02:25:16.774 --> 02:25:17.442
SO YOU KNOW IT IT'S TO TRAIN.

02:25:17.508 --> 02:25:19.544
BACK OVER BUT- A VISA TO BRAND

02:25:19.610 --> 02:25:21.746
NEW. ON MANY TO COME. ARE ARE

02:25:21.813 --> 02:25:24.582
DOING. I BELIEVE ALL OF THEM

02:25:24.649 --> 02:25:26.717
ARE LIKE A- IF IN SOME OF

02:25:26.784 --> 02:25:28.920
ANOTHER. OF THEM ARE. PREPARED

02:25:28.986 --> 02:25:29.854
EXTREMELY ONE FOR OR ANOTHER T.

02:25:29.921 --> 02:25:31.122
V. SO I THINK IT'S MY OF A

02:25:31.189 --> 02:25:33.024
STRETCH- I THINK THE THREE

02:25:33.091 --> 02:25:34.659
LEADING COMPANIES ALREADY ARE

02:25:34.725 --> 02:25:37.028
USING SAM'S. FOR THEIR PLATFORM

02:25:37.095 --> 02:25:39.063
SO- YOU KNOW AGAIN WE WANNA BE

02:25:39.130 --> 02:25:40.431
MINDFUL OF THAT WE'RE NOT

02:25:40.498 --> 02:25:43.000
IMPEDING ROLLOUT BUT- WE ALSO I

02:25:43.067 --> 02:25:44.268
THINK HAVE IMPORTANT CLINICAL
