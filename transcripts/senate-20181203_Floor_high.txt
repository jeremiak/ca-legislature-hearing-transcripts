IN THIS VERY SACRED SEAT OF DEMOCRACY TO SERVE THE MOST DIVERSE AND DYNAMIC CONSTITUENCY IN THE WORLD. THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE SPOKEN. ONE CONTINUES TO SPEAK VERY LOUDLY. AS IS HER RIGHT. AT THE CALIFORNIAN AN AMERICAN. NEARLY TWO THIRDS OF REGISTERED VOTERS CAST A BALLOT IN THIS ELECTION A RECENT RECORD FOR NON PRESIDENTIAL YEAR. THEY SPOKE LOUDLY AND CLEARLY THEY SENT US HERE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR VOICES ARE HEARD AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. AND TO WRITE THE NEXT TO NEW BOLD CHAPTER OF THE STATE'S HISTORY. SPEAKING OF NEW AND BOLD. I WANT TO CONGRATULATE SOMEONE THAT I'VE BEEN PROUD TO CALL A FRIEND IN A WORKING PARTNER. SINCE HE WAS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR AND I WAS A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER REMEMBER. THOSE DAYS. WE WILL MISS HIM AS PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE BUT I SUSPECT WE'LL BE HEARING A LOT MORE FROM HIM OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS. TO MY FRIEND IN OUR GOVERNOR ELECT GAVIN NEWSOM.

WE GOT IMPORTANT THINGS DONE IN CALIFORNIA IS BETTER FOR IT TODAY. I WANNA THANK YOU FOR YOUR VISION AND YOUR WISDOM IT IS BEEN A REAL HONOR. BUT I DO WANNA LET THE RECORD REFLECT I DID OFFER HIM A NICER CHAIR. BUT AS WOULD BE TRUE OF OUR GOVERNOR HE PICKS THE MORE OBSCURE OUT OF THE WAY CHAIR WHERE HE CAN WATCH. AND AND JUST HAVE HIS OWN THOUGHTS SO I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO THINK I GAVE YOU A LESSER CHAIR MISTER GOVERNOR -- BUT WE WANT TO THANK YOU IT TRULY HAS BEEN AN HONOR. I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE -- ANOTHER -- CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICER WHO'S WITH US TODAY WHO FOR NOW MAYBE LEAVING PUBLIC OFFICE BUT I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE OUR INSURANCE COMMISSIONER AS WELL. DAVE JONES. WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR OUTSTANDING SERVICE TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. AT YOU KNOW IF I MAY I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ANOTHER ACKNOWLEDGEMENT. RIGHT OVER THERE WERE SENATOR WIENER NOW SETS. IS THE DESK OF SENATE MAJORITY LEADER ARE WAS THE DESK OF SENATE MAJORITY LEADER GEORGE MISS COUNTY. FROM THAT DESK HE PASSED LANDMARK BILLS ESTABLISHING THE SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM PROMOTING BILINGUAL EDUCATION AND PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN AND LGBT CALIFORNIANS. FORTY YEARS AGO LAST WEEK GEORGE MOSCONI WAS SLAIN IN THE PRIME OF HIS PUBLIC SERVICE CAREER. ALONG WITH HIM SUPERVISOR HARSH IN HARVEY MILK WAS STOLEN FROM US BY THAT VERY SAME TRAGEDY. AND I THEIR SAY WITHOUT THEIR LEGACIES AND THEIR LEADERSHIP I WOULDN'T BE HERE TODAY A PROUD MEMBER OF THE LGBT COMMUNITY. LEADING THE MST EFFECTIVE LEGISLATIVE BODY IN AMERICA. AND TOGETHER AS WE WORK TO MAKE HISTORY WE MUST ALWAYS REMEMBER OUR OWN HISTORY. YOU KNOW WE'RE FORTUNATE TO FIND OURSELVES IN THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. IN THE CALIFORNIA STORY. TEN YEARS AFTER FINANCIAL CRISIS THROUGH OUR STATE INTO DISARRAY WERE BACK ON OUR FEET. WE'VE COME FROM UNGOVERNABLE MESS TO UNDENIABLE SUCCESS. WE FOUGHT HARD TO GET WHERE WE ARE TODAY. CLIMBING OUT OF THE WORST RECESSION SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. SLOWLY RESTORING THE VITAL FUNDS THAT WE WERE FORCED TO CUT FROM OUR CLASSROOMS FROM OUR CLINICS. AND FROM OUR COMMUNITY CENTERS. TODAY WE'RE REACHING NEW HEIGHTS IN JOB GROWTH AND EMPLOYMENT LEVELS IN NEW AND NEW LOWS IN THE RATES OF THE UNINSURED. WE ARE INVESTING MORE IN K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION THAN EVER BEFORE. WE'VE HAD INCREASED OUR INVESTMENT IN UC AND CSU TWO OF OUR STATES MOST IMPORTANT PUBLIC RESOURCES. AND THANKS TO THE LEGISLATURE THE UC HAS INCREASED ITS COMMITMENT TO SERVING CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. WE'RE REBUILDING VITAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT KEEPS OUR ECONOMY MOVING AND GROWING OUR ROADS ARE TRANSIT AND HOUSING. WE'RE TAKING AGGRESSIVE STEPS TO LIVE FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY AND HELPING WORKING CLASS HOUSEHOLDS MEET THEIR NEEDS. AND WE'VE TORN DOWN THE WALL OF DEBT. WHILE BUILDING RECORD RESERVES TO NEARLY SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS. WE ALL KNOW THE GOVERNOR BROWN DESERVES ENORMOUS CREDIT FOR LEADING US THROUGH TURBULENT TIMES. LET ME BE CLEAR THIS BODY ALONG WITH THE ASSEMBLY DOWN THE HALL HAS BEEN AT LEAST EQUAL PARTNERS ALONG THE WAY. IT'S BEEN A GREAT PARTNERSHIP. WE'VE LEARNED FROM OUR PAST MISTAKES. AND JUST AS MANY OF US ARE THAT SERVED. UNDER GOVERNOR BROWN ARE STILL WHO ARE TO SERVE WITH GOVERNOR ELECT GAVIN NEWSOM THEIR SENATORS THAT WERE SWORN IN TODAY WHO WILL SERVE WITH THE NEXT GOVERNOR. GOVERNOR'S MAY RECEIVE THE LION'S SHARE OF THE CREDIT. OR THE BLAME. BUT LAWMAKERS SHARE THE ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY. AND IT SENATORS WE EACH HAVE A VOTE AND WITH IT A VERY PERSONAL STAKE IN PROTECTING OUR STATE'S FINANCES. AND OUR FUTURE. WE MAY BE PREPARED TO AND DURING THE FIGURATIVE RAINY DAYS. BUT WE HAVE MUCH WORK TO DO TO PROTECT OUR STATE. AND OUR COMMUNITIES FROM THE VERY REAL RAVAGES OF NATURE. ALREADY THIS DECADE WE'VE ENTERED FIVE YEARS OF HISTORIC DROUGHT. SINCE OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR WE'VE BEEN GEORGE SIX OF THE TEN MOST DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRES IN OUR HISTORY INCLUDING THE CAMPFIRE THE MOST LETHAL. AND WE NO THE RISK OF THOSE FIRES DON'T END WITH THE LAST EMBERS HAVE BEEN PUT OUT. AS WE SAW WITH THE DEVASTATING MUD SLIDES IN VENTURA COUNTY. BUT NOW BYE NOW EVERYONE OF OUR FORTY SENATE DISTRICTS HAS FELT THE CONSEQUENCES. OF A WARMING CLIENT. IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER WE HAVE FELT IT. AND I WANT TO TAKE A MINUTE TO A KNOWLEDGE MEMBERS OF OUR HARDEST HIT COMMUNITIES. FOR THEIR TIRELESS ADVOCACY AND WHOLE HEARTED COMMITMENT TO RECOVERY. SENATORS MCGUIRE STERN DODD NIELSEN GAINES AND JACKSON TO NAME ONLY A FEW. I FELT THE IMPACTS CLOSE TO HOME. VERY CLOSE TO HOME. SO CLOSE IN FACT THAT SENATOR STERN LOST HIS HOME. IN THE WALLS THE FIRE. AND YET WITHOUT REGARD FOR THEIR OWN LOSSES ALL OF THEM. OR NEAR LOSSES THEY'VE BEEN RELENTLESS REPRESENTATIVES FOR THEIR NEIGHBORS FIRST. I WANT ACKNOWLEDGE ANOTHER COLLEAGUE DR JIM WOOD R. SIMPLY COLLEAGUE DOWN THE HALL. WHOSE OWN COMMUNITY WAS DEVASTATED -- BY FIRE A YEAR AGO. AS A LAWMAKER DOCTOR WHAT IS TAKEN A LEADING ROLE IN OUR POLICY RESPONSES AS YOU KNOW TO WILDFIRES ALONG WITH A NUMBER OF OUR COLLEAGUES. BUT AS A FORENSIC DENTIST HE'S ALSO QUIETLY TAKEN ON THE HEART WRENCHING BURDEN OF IDENTIFYING VICTIMS. ON BEHALF OF THIS CHAMBER I WANT TO OFFER MY DEEPEST GRATITUDE TO DR WOULD. TO ARE INCREDIBLE SENATORS HERE TODAY. TO THE THOUSANDS OF FIRST RESPONDERS ON THE FRONT LINES. AND ALSO TO ALL OF THE GOOD SAMARITANS ACROSS OUR STATE WHO ARE RISING TO THE OCCASION. TO HEAL HOWLS AND SUPPORT SURVIVORS. THEIR HUMBLE ACTS OF HUMANITY SHOULD MAKE US ALL PROUD. WE CAN HONOR THE VICTIMS AND THEIR SACRIFICES AND SO MANY OF THE SACRIFICES OF OUR NEIGHBORS BY TAKING PRO ACTIVE STEPS TO PREPARE. FOR AND WHERE POSSIBLE PREVENT THE NEXT TRAGEDY BEFORE IT REACHES ARE VERY COMMUNITIES. WE CAN AFFORD TO IGNORE THE EXTRAORDINARY FINANCIAL COST EITHER OF THOSE DISASTERS WHICH ARE MOUNTING HERE AND ACROSS THE NATION. ACCORDING TO FEDERAL STATISTICS NOT GO GIVE YOU A LOT OF STATISTICS. CLIMATE AND WEATHER DISASTERS COST AMERICANS MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS ALONE LAST YEAR THAT'S NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA IT'S ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. AND WE MAY NEVER BE ABLE TO FULLY MEASURE THE ECONOMIC AND THE HEALTH BURDENS OF THE THICK CLOUDS OF SMOKE HANGING OVER OUR COMMUNITIES EVEN TODAY. CLOUDS OF FORCE MORE THAN ONE MILLION CHILDREN FROM THEIR CLASSROOMS. LEAVING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF OUR NEIGHBORS HOMELESS AND CALLSAND COUNTLESS LOST WORKDAYS THAT AFFECT INDIVIDUALS ENTIRE COMMUNITIES AND ARE VERY ECONOMY. WE'RE IN UNCHARTED TERRITORY. AND ALL SIGNS INDICATE WE'VE ONLY JUST BEGUN TO FEEL THE HARSH NEW REALITIES OF A WARMING PLANET. WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE IMPACTS REACH ACROSS EVERY FACET OF OUR LIVES FROM PUBLIC HEALTH TO HOUSING EDUCATION AND OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA ARE RESILIENT. AND NOW WE NEED TO INSURE THAT ARE BUILT ENVIRONMENTS ARE AS WELL. THAT'S OUR NEXT CHALLENGE. WE TOOK IMPORTANT STEPS THIS YEAR TO ADAPT INCLUDING REVAMPING OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROTOCOLS. AND WE BECAME THE FIRST MAJOR ECONOMY ON EARTH TO COMMIT TO A TWENTY FORTY FIVE BUT WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME IF WE WANT TO AVOID EVEN WORSE DAYS. AHEAD FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. SO WE HAVE QUITE A BIT OF WORK STILL TO DO. TO GET OUR OWN HOUSE IN ORDER AS WELL. WE HAVE BIG CHALLENGES BIG ISSUES. WE ALSO HAVE INTERNAL ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON I SAID WHEN I TOOK THIS OFFICE THAT MY MANDATE WOULD BE TO RAISE THE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT. AND PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY IN THE SENATE AN IN THIS CAPITAL. I MEANT IT THEN AND I MEAN IT NOW. WE'VE TAKEN STEPS THROUGH OUR JOINT RULES COMMITTEE TO IMPLEMENT CONFIDENTIAL REPORTING. SYSTEM AND AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS TO BOTH PROTECT VICTIMS. OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT AND ENSURE JUSTICE IS SERVED. BUT WE CAN'T BE SATISFIED WITH OUR PROGRESS BECAUSE THESE STEPS ALONE WON'T CHANGE THE CULTURE. OF THIS BUILDING. ONLY WE CAN DO THAT. AND THE HARD TRUTH IS THAT THIS WORK WILL NEVER BE FINISHED BECAUSE THERE IS NO FINAL DESTINATION. CALIFORNIA. IN SO MANY WAYS WE ARE A STUDY IN PROGRESS BUT WE'RE ALSO A WORK IN PROGRESS WE CAN'T AFFORD COMPLACENCY WE STILL HAVE SO MUCH WORK TO DO. BECAUSE THE GULF BETWEEN HAVES AND HAVE NOTS IN THE STATE IS AS WIDE AS OUR LEGENDARY CENTRAL VALLEY IS VAST. AND IT'S ONLY GROWING. HOUSING PRICES HAVE SOARED OUT OF REACH FOR WORKING FAMILIES AND DESPITE OUR RECENT EFFORTS WERE NOT BUILDING NEARLY ENOUGH TO MEET THAT DEMAND. IN A STATE KNOWN FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION OVER A MILLION RESIDENTS STILL DON'T HAVE RELIABLE CLEAN DRINKING WATER. AND MILLIONS MORE BRIEF THE MOST POLLUTED AIR IN OUR NATION. THESE CONTRAST THE FINE ARTS CHALLENGE. AS LAWMAKERS WE MUST HELP TO HARNESS CALIFORNIA'S EXTRA ORDINARY BOUNTIES IN ORDER TO MEET OUR MANY URGENT NEEDS. WE MUST ALIGN OUR ACTIONS WITH OUR VALUES. IF WE DON'T ACKNOWLEDGE THESE CHALLENGES WE WILL NEVER OVERCOME THEM. SO I CHALLENGE EACH OF YOU TO SEARCH WITHIN YOURSELVES. THIS SESSION TO FIND THE URGENCY WE WILL NEED TO MATCH THE TASK BEFORE US. WE CAN DO MORE TO BRIDGER DIVIDES TO LIFT UP THOSE WERE FALLING BEHIND WE CAN REWARD AMBITION. AND INGENUITY AND LEARN FROM OUR FAILURES. WHATEVER THE CASE WE MUST CONTINUE TO TAKE RISK AND TO MAKE PROGRESS. BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH WE'RE DOING WELL WE AREN'T DOING ENOUGH. AFTER ALL WE'RE THE STATE OF INVENTION NOT CONVENTION. AND THAT'S WHAT DEFINES CALIFORNIA. SOUND FAMILIAR AND AS I THOUGHT YOU WOULD. THROUGH PIONEERING SPIRIT THAT PENSION FOR IMAGINATION IS WHAT MADE CALIFORNIA THE ENVY OF THE WORLD AND THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY ON EARTH. WHETHER IT WAS THE VISION OF SO MANY IMMIGRANTS FROM AROUND THE WORLD TO COME TO OUR VALLEYS AND GROW THE GREATEST HARVEST THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN. OR THE INITIATIVE OF INDUSTRY OUTCAST THE BILL THE IN ENTERTAINMENT CAPITAL OF THE WORLD IN A DUSTY LITTLE TOWN. CALLED HOLLYWOOD. AT THE CAPTURE SO MANY HEARTS AND MINDS AND IMAGINATIONS ON EVERY CONTINENT. OR THE INGENUITY OF A SON OF A SYRIAN IMMIGRANTS TO START APPLE COMPUTER IN A GARAGE IN LOS ALTOS AND CHANGE THE WAY. THE WORLD WORKS. THAT COULD INFLUENCE OF OPEN MINDS CREATIVITY AND DARING WHAT EVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT. THAT IS CALIFORNIA'S GREATEST COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. THERE IS NO PLACE ON EARTH MORE CAPABLE OF MAKING DREAMS REALITY. AND NO GROUP OF CALLING. NO GROUP OF COLLEAGUES MORE CAPABLE OF MAKING HISTORY. AND NOW IT IS MY INCREDIBLE HONOR TO RECOGNIZE OUR REPUBLICAN LEADER. A WOMAN THAT IS MY PARTNER IN THE SENATE AND LEADING THIS COLLECTIVE BODY SENATOR PAT BATES SENATOR BATES THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- WHAT A WHAT AN INCREDIBLE DAY YOU GUYS SO I AM GOING TO GET OFF MY PREPARED SPEECH FOR JUST A MINUTE?
