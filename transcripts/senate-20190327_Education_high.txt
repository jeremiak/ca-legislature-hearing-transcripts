MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. LEYVA HERE LEYVA HERE WILK PRESIDENT WILK HERE CHIANG. CHAIN HERE THE RUSSELL. LASSO HERE GLAZER MCGUIRE PAN. VERY GOOD THANK YOU WILL WELCOME TO TODAY'S SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE WE HAVE SIX BILLS ON THE AGENDA TODAY TWO ITEMS ARE ON CONSENT. SB FIFTY TWO WAS CENTER ATKINS AND SB THREE SIXTEEN BY SENATOR RUBIO WILL BEGIN WITH A SPECIAL ORDER TO HEAR SB ONE THIRTY EIGHT BY SENATOR ROTH SENATOR WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MORNING MEMBERS [inaudible] PLEASE ABSOLUTE. WE GET ORGANIZED HERE. FIRST LET ME EXCEPT THE FIVE AMENDMENTS. OFFERED BY THE COMMITTEE AND I WANT TO RECOGNIZE OF SHOWN CHANEL MATT NEED FOR A JOB -- EXTRAORDINARILY WELL DONE ON THE ANALYSIS THANK YOU. THIS BILL IS A SIMPLE BILL BUT A VERY IMPORTANT BILL THAT REQUIRES SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO WORK WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS TO IDENTIFY THE BEST METHOD. TO INFORM BOTH PARENTS AND STUDENTS. ON WHAT IS A VERY VERY DANGEROUS. IF MISDIAGNOSED OR UNDIAGNOSED DISEASE TYPE ONE DIABETES. AS YOU MAY KNOW TYPE ONE DIABETES IS AN AUTO IMMUNE SYSTEM DISEASE THAT ATTACKS THE PANCREAS. PREVENTING IT FROM MAKING INSULIN. WITH THE LACK OF INSULIN A RISE IN BLOOD GLUCOSE QUICKLY CAN LEAD TO SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS INCLUDING DEATH. WELL WE TYPICALLY DO NOT REQUIRE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO PROVIDE THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION I BELIEVE AND WE BELIEVE IN THIS CASE IT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO DO SO. AND THIS BECAUSE TYPE ONE DIABETES CAN BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO DETECT PARTICULARLY IN CHILDREN. FIVE AND UNDER. VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS WHO FREQUENTLY CAN'T TELLUS. WHAT'S WRONG. IT IS IMPERATIVE HEARD OF THE PARENTS AND STUDENTS ARE AWARE OF THE TYPES OF SYMPTOMS. AND SIGNS I HAVE THREE WITNESSES WITH ME TODAY TO PROVIDE SOME BRIEF REMARKS. BRET MICHAELS WHO I THINK YOU JUST HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET. THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION MEMBER AND OUR FORMER COLLEAGUE FORMER STATE SENATOR TED GAINES. AND MY CONSTITUENT. OF VERY VERY -- PASSIONATE TYPE ONE DIABETES EDUCATION ADVOCATE DAVID GEORGE. SO TO LEAD US OFF WITH THE PERSONAL ACCOUNT. MADAM CHAIR. MR BRET MICHAELS AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO. DID NOT GOOGLE HIM AND IT DID NOT PURCHASE ONE OF THE FORTY PLUS MILLION ALBUMS HE SOLD. HE IS A SUCCESSFUL VOCAL ARTIST ENTREPRENEUR AND PHILANTHROPIST. WHO MANY MAY NOT KNOW? HAS DEVOTED A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF HIS WELLS. AND HIS TIME. TO EDUCATE. ON THE ISSUE OF TYPE ONE DIABETES VENTURE. MISTER MICHAELS WELCOME PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY. I JUST WANT TO SAY IS A TYPE ONE DIABETIC -- SINCE THE AGE OF SIX AND NOW AT THE AGE OF FIFTY SIX IT IS SO IMPORTANT THIS THIS SENATE BILL ONE THIRTY EIGHT TO PASSAGE THROUGH. EDUCATION AND EMPOWER MAN IS EVERYTHING AND FOR ME AS A CHILD I WAS DIAGNOSED. AT THE AGE OF SIX AND WAS EXTREMELY EXTREMELY SICK AND NO ONE UNDERSTOOD WHAT IT WAS BECAUSE THERE'S NO EDUCATION ON IT. ANDSO YOU KNOW AS A DIABETIC YOUR BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL CAN RISE EXTREMELY HIGH. MINDED UP TO ALMOST EIGHT HUNDRED WHICH WAS PRETTY MENDOZA KETO ACIDOSIS LEVEL. BECAUSE OF THE ON EDUCATION ON IT AND MY FAMILY. AS MUCH AS A LOT ME THOUGHT I HAD THE FLU OR DE HYDRATED MISDIAGNOSED BY THE SCHOOL NURSE DOCTORS AND AGAIN. GOES BACK -- TO IT WHEN I GOT TO THE HOSPITAL I SPENT ALMOST. ALMOST A MONTH IN THE HOSPITAL ONCE A DIAGNOSED AND WERE ABLE TO START TO CORRECT -- THE HIGH BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL AND IT IS A VERY VERY DEADLY DISEASE IF LEFT UNDIAGNOSED. AND I THINK IT IS SUCH A STRONG BUILD THIS BILL TO EDUCATE. AND LET EVERYONE KNOW -- IF YOU HAVE AN EMPOWERMENT AND AND NOT KNOWLEDGE THAT WE TALK ABOUT. ANY ABILITY TO EDUCATE PEOPLE AND I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO CHECK THEIR BLOOD SUGAR COULD BE AS SIMPLE AS A A FINGER STACK. AND SHOWS ANY KIND OF ELEVATED LEVEL AT ALL. IT GIVES THEM A CHANCE TO IMMEDIATELY BE ABLE TO PREPARE THEMSELVES TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. AND LIKE HE SHIRTS SAYS IN OUR CAMPAIGN IF YOU KNOW. RIGHT HOW KNOWLEDGE IS IS POWER -- NEXT IS BEING ABLE TO SURVIVE THAT IMPACT BECAUSE NOT JUST IMPACTS THE CHILD WITH JUVENILE DIABETES THE WHOLE FAMILY EVERYBODY IS IMPACTED RIGHT. AND AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN -- TO BE ABLE TO THRIVE YOU WANT TO LIVE AN UNBELIEVABLY GREAT LIFE YOU WON'T HAVE THAT CHANCE. AND I SAY PLEASE CONSIDER THIS SO THAT WE ARE NOT VICTIMS BUT VICTOR'S. VERY MUCH MISTER MICHAELS. SENATOR GAINES WELCOME NICE TO CO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY COME AND TESTIFY FOR CENTER ROSS BILL THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- IT'S SO CRITICAL AYE MY STORY -- IS -- INTERTWINED WITH POLITICS -- IT WAS BACK. ALL ABOUT -- EIGHT YEARS AGO NOW NINE YEARS AGO -- I WROTE WHAT'S IN THE ASSEMBLY AROUND FOR THE STATE SENATE -- MY WIFE -- RAN FOR THE ASSEMBLY [inaudible] AND ONE THAT RACISM WAS BEING SWORN IN AND WE WERE AT THE CAPITOL -- DURING THAT CEREMONY -- MY SON TEDDY -- AND OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS WERE AND THAT'S OFFICE SAID SHE WAS GOING TO TAKE AFTER BEING SWORN IN. AND TEDDY CAME. RUNNING TO US AND SAYING -- SAID. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH KELLY BUT SHE'S LIKE THIS. BLUE PURPLE COLOR AND SHE'S COLLAPSED ON THE DESK. IN THE CAPITOL OFFICE SO -- WE WENT TO THE NURSES STATION AND THEY SAID YOU KNOW THIS COULD BE TYPED IT IT DID THIS BUT WE'RE NOT SURE. WE RECOMMEND SHE HAS THE ARE SO. WE CALL HER DOCTOR DOCTOR SAID I ONCE YOUR FIRST BEFORE SHE GOES THE ARE -- OUT WITH THEM TO THE DOCTOR TWICE AND THIS IS BEEN MISDIAGNOSED AND I I DON'T BLAME THE DOCTOR I THINK IT'S AN EDUCATION RELATED ISSUE. BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE HER BLOOD CHECKED TWICE BUT IN THOSE BLOOD TESTS. IT DID NOT INCLUDE THE GLUCOSE LEVEL AND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THAT WOULD HAVE TOLD US IMMEDIATELY. SO -- WE ADMITTED HER INTO THE HOSPITAL SHE WENT INTO I SEE YOU FOR SIX DAYS -- HEARD GLUCOSE LEVELS OVER EIGHT HUNDRED WHICH IS VERY HIGH I MEAN IT SHOULD BE BETWEEN EIGHTY AND A HUNDRED AND TWENTY IN THAT. IN THAT RANGE. AND SO -- THE ABILITY TO KNOW WHAT THE EARLY SIGNS ARE -- I WISH WE HAD KNOWN BUT THE DOCTOR SAYING IT. LOOKS LIKE MAYBE SHE HAD A COLD AND SHE'S RECOVERING FROM A COLD AND THAT SHE SAID MAYBE SHE'S. DEPRESSED BECAUSE YOUR MOM'S GONNA BE WORKING THE LEGISLATURE WE'RE GOING. NOTE THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AND SO -- SHE WAS -- CONSTANTLY THIRSTY -- SHE WAS FOR RATIONS INNER APPETITE -- SHE WAS WAITING YOUR BED AT AGE. EIGHT OF THESE THINGS THE STINT WERE MAKING ANY SENSE SHOULDN'T HAVE THE ENERGY TO BE CARRIED AN FOR THE DOCTOR LATER AYE. I HELPED HELPED HER COMMENT. TO MEET THE DOCTOR THE SECOND TIME SO. WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT SHE'S WITH US IN THAT SHE'S THRIVING AT AGE SIXTEEN SHE'S A JUNIOR -- SHE'S VERY STRONG IN MATH AND SCIENCE AND WANTS TO GO IN THE FIELD OF MEDICINE. I'M SURE THERE'S A CORRELATION THERE. SO -- JUST THANKFUL FOR SENATOR RALPH AND FOR THIS BILL -- HOPEFULLY MOVING FORWARD. OFFER A SIMPLE ARE GLUCOSE A BLOOD TEST THANK YOU. THE CENTER GAINES WELCOME. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME I APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK I'M GOING TO READ SOMETHING THAT I TYPED UP I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND. SO MY NAME IS DEBBIE GEORGIA MY SON DYLAN HAS TYPE ONE DIABETES. DON WAS DIAGNOSED AT TWENTY FIVE MONTHS OLD AND HE IS NOW SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD AND A JUNIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL. TYPE ONE DIABETES IS A MANAGEABLE DISEASE IF PROPERLY DIAGNOSED IN A TIMELY MANNER. THE PROBLEM IS AS YOU'RE HEARING IT USUALLY TAKES TWO OR THREE VISITS TO THE DOCTOR BEFORE PERSONS PROPERLY DIAGNOSED. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO MY PRECIOUS BABY BOY ONE VISIT TO THE PEDIATRICIAN. AND TO VISITS TO URGENT CARE BEFORE MY SON WAS DIAGNOSED WITH TYPE ONE DIABETES. BY THIS TIME DON'T HAVE A BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL OF FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT HE WAS IN DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS AND HAD COLLAPSED VEINS DUE TO DEHYDRATION. HE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL FOR FOUR DAYS GETTING HIS BLOOD SUGAR STABILIZED. I WILL NEVER FORGET THE NURSE TELLING ME. IT'S A GOOD THING YOU GOT HIM IN HE MAY NOT HAVE SURVIVED THE NIGHT. IT WAS THE MOST TERRIFYING GUT WRENCHING FEELING TO THINK I COULD HAVE LOST MY PRECIOUS SON AND ALL BECAUSE OF HIGH. NOR TO THE DOCTORS KNEW THE SYMPTOMS TO THE ONSET OF TYPE ONE DIABETES. OVER THE YEARS THERE BEEN MANY ADVANCEMENTS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF TYPE ONE DAVE DIABETES WHICH IS WONDERFUL. BUT SADLY THERE BEEN NO ADVANCEMENTS IN EDUCATION FOR AWARENESS ON THIS DISEASE. CHILDREN AND ADULTS ARE STILL GOING UNDIAGNOSED ENDING UP IN SOME CASES WITH LIFE THREATENING COMPLICATIONS AND EVEN DYING. THIS MUST AND TOO MANY CHILDREN ADULTS ARE DYING FROM IT A MANAGEABLE DISEASE. BECAUSE PEOPLE WITH TYPE ONE DIABETES ARE CONSIDERED TO BE A MINORITY OF THE DIABETIC POPULATION THERE IS A LACK OF EDUCATION AND PUBLIC AWARENESS. WE SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES NEEDED TO GET AN ACCURATE NUMBER OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH TYPE ONE DIABETES IN ORDER TO PROVE THIS MINORITY GROUP IS GROWING AND GROWING FAST. THIS IS AN AN INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING. IN FACT ONE OF THE BIG DIABETES ORGANIZATIONS WEBSITE STILL STATES THE SAME STATISTICS THEY HAD LISTED FIFTEEN YEARS AGO WHEN MY SON WAS FIRST DIAGNOSED. IT'S TIME THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS THAT DIABETES IS NOT A SINGLE DISEASE AND SHOULD NOT BE LUMPED TOGETHER AS SUCH. KNOWING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TYPE ONE AND TYPE TWO DIABETES CAN BE THE DIFFERENCE LITERALLY BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH. EDUCATING THE PUBLIC TO OUR SCHOOLS WILL RAISE AWARENESS TO THE SYMPTOMS OF TYPE ONE DIABETES FOR PARENTS GUARDIANS AND CARE GIVERS WHICH CAN HELP DETECT AND EARLY DIAGNOSIS. RAISING AWARENESS IN SCHOOL IS CRUCIAL BECAUSE TYPE ONE DIABETES AFFECTS MANY OF OUR STUDENTS. IF STUDENTS ARE AWARE OF THE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF TYPE ONE DIABETES SUCH AS HYPERGLYCEMIA WHICH IS A HIGH BLOOD SUGAR OR HYPOGLYCEMIA LOW BLOOD SUGAR. AND KNOW WHAT TO DO TO HELP A STUDENT WHO MAY BE IN DISTRESS THEY COULD POTENTIALLY SAVE A LIFE. RAISING AWARENESS WILL ALSO BRING COMPASSION AND UNDERSTANDING OF THIS AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE WHICH WILL HELP AND THE STEREO TYPES AND BULLYING THAT MAY COME TO STUDENTS WHO ARE DIFFERENT. AS A MOTHER OF THIS OF A SON WITH TYPE ONE DIABETES AND FOUNDER OF THE EASTYOU WENDY TYPE ONE DIABETES AWARENESS. I FULLY SUPPORT SENATE BILL ONE THIRTY EIGHT I THANK SENATOR ROBB FOR AUTHORING THE AUTHOR AUTHORING THIS LIFESAVING EDUCATIONAL BILL. AND ARE ON A ROLL CALL HONORABLE CONNIE LEIVA AND SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE MEMBERS I URGE YOU TO VOTE BY.

BUT I THINK EVERYONE IS PRETTY MUCH IN AGREEMENT THAT THIS IS A GREAT BILL SO WE'RE GOOD OKAY SENATE ROTH WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF CLEARLY LACK OF AWARENESS AND EDUCATION ON THIS ISSUE CAN COST A LIFE. AND IT HAS. WE MUST GET THE WORD OUT AND WE MUST DO IT NOW -- LIVES DEPEND ON IT. IN CALLING SAYS THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP. THANK YOU SENATOR ROTH TO HAVE SOMEONE MAKE A MOTION FOR THE THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER MA'AM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ITEM ONE SB ONE THREE EIGHT THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS LEYVA HI Là I WILL HI WILK I CHIANG HI CHIANG I'D RUSSELL. RUSSELL I GLAZER GLAZER AYE MCGUIRE PAN. PAN AYE. SIX ZERO THAT BILL IS OUT CONGRATULATIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU CENTER RODDICK YOU MADAM CHAIR COATINGS. BUT WE WILL LEAVE AN ON CALL WHO ARE? OKAY WE'RE GONNA. WE HAVE A CLOSE. SENATOR GLAZER WOULD YOU LIKE TO PRESENT YOUR BILL THAT ARE GLAZER WHENEVER YOU'RE READY OKAY AT THANK YOU CHAIR LEYVA AND MEMBERS. AT FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH ME AND MY STAFF -- ON THIS ISSUE. I AM PLEASED TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS ON PAGE SIX OF THE ANALYSIS -- THAT DO REMOVE THE TUITION FREEZE PREVENTION AND ALLOW STUDENTS TO RECEIVE A GRANT AWARD BASED ON THE ELIGIBILITY OUTLINED IN FOR CAL GRANTS AND AND FOR PELL GRANTS. AS AMENDED -- THIS BILL CREATES INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE UNDERSERVED STUDENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE PROGRAM. THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE PROGRAM WHICH WENT INTO EFFECT IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN GAVE STUDENTS WHO WANT TO GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS TO TOOLS TO HELP THEM DO SO. SO FAR NEARLY EIGHT THOUSAND HAVE PARTICIPATED. ARE THE PREVIOUS BILL CREATING THE PROGRAM REQUIRED THIS CSU TO SUBMIT A REPORT WITH RECOMMENDATIONS. ON POTENTIAL INCENTIVES THAT COULD ENCOURAGE STUDENT PARTICIPATION -- GOING FORWARD THEY'VE DONE THIS. IN THEIR REPORT THEY NOTED THAT EFFECTIVE INCENTIVES -- QUOTING COULD ENCOURAGE MORE STUDENTS TO KEEP PACE WITH THEIR COMMITMENTS AND COULD SERVE AS A MEANS TO ATTRACT MORE STUDENTS TO COMMIT TO THESE PROGRAMS AT THE ONSET OF THEIR ACADEMIC CAREERS. BUILDING UPON THE CS USE RECOMMENDATION. AND COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THIS BILL WOULD ESTABLISH THE STUDENT SUCCESS IN ON TIME COMPLETION FUND. ALLOW MORE MONEY TO BE APPROPRIATE TO THIS FUND BY THE LEGISLATURE ONLY BY THE LEGISLATURE. TO BE USED FOR SUMMER TERM GRANTS AND ON TRACK PROGRESS GRANTS. STARTING JULY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY IT WOULD PROVIDE -- BACK IN TUITION WAIVERS FOR ALL REMAINING CLASSES NEEDED TO GRADUATE WHEN A CAMPUS IS UNABLE TO PROVIDE A PATHWAY TO GRADUATE. IN FOUR YEARS SO TO BE CLEAR ON THIS THE BILL HAS ONLY ONE MANDATE AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS OPTIONAL. THE MANDATE IS IF A STUDENT CAN GET A CLASS THAT THEY NEED TO GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS AND THEY'RE IN THE PROMISE PROGRAM. UNDER THIS LEGISLATION THE UNIVERSITY WOULD PROVIDED AT NO COST AND THAT'S A PROVISION THAT SUPPORTED BY THE UNIVERSITY -- EVERYTHING ELSE IS OPTIONAL THAT REQUIRES THE TRUSTEES -- THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE THE PRESIDENTS OF THE CAMPUSES AND OF COURSE THE LEGISLATURE. WHICH WOULD NEED TO FIND THESE ADDITIONAL ENHANCEMENTS -- FINALLY THE ME JUST SAY THAT -- THAT WE HAVE SO MUCH -- TO BE PRIDEFUL ABOUT OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM AT EVERY LEVEL THEY DO SO MANY AMAZING THINGS FOR OUR STUDENTS -- AND THEIR FAMILIES -- AND WE WE FOCUS A LOT ON ACCESSIBILITY AND AFFORDABILITY AND QUALITY. BUT THE ONE PLACE THAT WE HAVEN'T PAID ENOUGH ATTENTION IS STUDENT SUCCESS STUDENT COMPLETION TO A DEGREE. THREE YEARS AGO THE FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE AT THE STATE UNIVERSITY BUT IT'S 19%. CUT THROUGH IN FOUR YEARS. ODDS IT'S UNACCEPTABLY LOW AND THAT'S WHY THE LEGISLATURE ACTED IN THE GOVERNOR ACTED. TO PROMOTE THESE PROMISE PROGRAMS IS FOR YOUR GRADUATION RATE PROGRAMS. I AM PLEASED WITH THE GREAT WORK AT THE FACULTY AND THE ADMINISTRATION. THE CURRENT FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE TODAY IS AT 25%. AND THEY SET A GOAL TO REACH 40% BY. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THESE INCENTIVES IN THIS LEGISLATION I AND OTHER THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING -- IN THE SYSTEM I THINK ARE REALLY GOING TO MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE FOR SO MANY AND I APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THE BILL TODAY. PLEASE TO HAVE WITH ME I HAD A BRAG STAFF FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION AND LOOK FOR HER TESTIMONY. YOU CENTER GLAZER WAS BRAG STAFF PLEASE PROCEED. A GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE -- CHERRY LEYVA AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS HANNAH BRAG SIDE AND I'M THE LEGISLATIVE POLICY ANALYST AT THE CAL STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION WHICH REPRESENTS THE NEARLY HALF A MILLION CSU STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE. WE ARE THANKFUL FOR SENATOR GLAZER FOR THE WORK HE'S DONE ON SB ONE FOUR EIGHT THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE PROGRAM. FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN SENATOR GLAZER BROUGHT THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE BILL TORE BOARD CSS A OPPOSE THE BILL. AT THE TIME WE FELT LIKE THE TUITION FREEZE AS WELL AS THE IDEA THAT ONLY THE PRIVILEGED STUDENTS COULD ACCESS THE PROGRAM DID NOT HAVE STUDENT EQUITY AT THE HEART OF THE PROGRAM. MAKING OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE TO ONLY THOSE STUDENTS WITH THE FINANCIAL ABILITY TO TAKE THEM AS NON EQUITABLE SOLUTION TO US. MANY STUDENTS HAVE TO WORK MULTIPLE JOBS TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES AND MANY TIMES THEIR TAKING FIFTEEN UNITS IS NOT A QUESTION OF WELL OR LAZINESS AS THE STUDENTS ARE TYPICALLY WORKING HARDER THAN ANYONE COULD EVER IMAGINE. AND AS AN ORGANIZATION THAT REPRESENTS CSU STUDENTS WAS SUCH A HIGH LEVEL OF POWER RECIPIENTS FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS AND UNDER REPRESENTED POPULATIONS EQUITY IS AN ABSOLUTE PRIORITY FOR US. IT'S AND ARE VERY MISSION AS AN ORGANIZATION THAT IS WHY WE ARE SO APPRECIATIVE OF THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE ON SB FOUR EIGHT BY SENATOR GLAZER AND HIS STAFF. TO COME UP WITH INCENTIVES TO ENABLE ALL STUDENTS A GOOD FAITH OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE PROGRAMS WITH THE ADDED INCENTIVES SUMMER TERM GRANTS ON TRACK PROGRESS GRAMPS TO OFFSET NON TUITION COSTS. AND NO TUITION CHARGE FOR STUDENTS TO TAKE LONGER THAN FOUR YEARS DUE TO INSTITUTIONAL FAULT THE BILL NOW ADDRESSES MANY OF OUR CONCERNS REGARDING EQUITY. GOING TO COLLEGE HAS A NUMBER OF BENEFITS FOR OUR STUDENTS PARTICULARLY IN THE CAL STATE SYSTEM. THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR UPWARD SOCIAL MOBILITY IS CHIEF AMONG THEM THIS PERSPECTIVE IS SUPPORTED BY RESEARCH THAT A SHOWN MANY CAL STATE CAMPUSES ARE ARE THE NATIONAL LEADERS ON ENOUGH ENABLING EXCUSE ME. UPWARD SOCIAL MOBILITY CAL STATE LA AS THE NUMBER ONE INSTITUTION TO DO THIS BUT THIS BENEFIT IS NEVER REALIZED INCIDENTS ARE ACTUALLY WORSE OFF IF THEY CANNOT GRADUATE. IF THE STATE CREATES PROGRAMS THAT HELP STUDENTS GRADUATE QUICKER EVEN SMALLER SUBSET TO STUDENTS THAT HAS AN IMPACT ON ALL STUDENTS SIMPLY PUT GRADUATING STUDENTS QUICKER OPENS UP COURSE BASED. ACROSS THE BOARD AS WELL AS ENROLLMENT SOUGHT. SB ONE FOUR EIGHT SIX TO DO JUST THIS NOW WITH THE INCENTIVES INCLUDED NOT ONLY WILL THE BENEFITS OF THE PROGRAM BE SEEN BY ALL STUDENTS IN THE SYSTEM. BUT NOW THE OPPORTUNITY TO PERSONALLY PARTICIPATE IN THE STUDENT ERIC SEES ME THIS PROGRAM IS OPEN TO ALL STUDENTS WE THANK THE SENATOR FOR HIS WORK ON THIS AND DRIVE VOTE TODAY. THANK YOU MS BURKE STAFF TO OTHERS IN SUPPORT. TO HAVE ANY OPPOSITION [inaudible] WELCOME [inaudible] GOOD MORNING. TO LEAVE A AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARIO GUERRERO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION -- I DO WANT TO START OFF BY THINKING SENATOR GLACIER FOR WORKING WITH US AND SPEAKING WITH US EARLY ABOUT ADDRESSING SOME OF OUR CONCERNS. WE AGREE ON THAT YOU KNOW THERE IS NO SECRET THE GRADUATION RATES. IN CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY ARE LOWER OVERALL -- THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE -- ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE BEEN IMPROVING -- HOWEVER WE WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AS HAS BEEN STATED THAT NOT ALL STUDENTS CAN GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS THERE ARE GOOD REASONS FOR THIS MANY STUDENTS HAVE TO WORK. IN ORDER TO ATTEND SCHOOL -- MANY STUDENTS HAVE FAMILIES TO SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS MAY BE THE FIRST IN THE FAMILY TO ATTEND COLLEGE -- STUDENTS ALSO MAY BE LACKING -- SUFFICIENT MENTORING -- IN A CLIMATE WHERE PART TIME FACULTY ARE THE NORM. I THINK WE ALL SUPPORT THE GOAL OF SB ONE FOUR EIGHT WHICH IS TO GRADUATE -- TO HELP STUDENTS GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS IF THEY ARE ABLE. TO HOWEVER CFA HAS SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT COULD DISPROPORTIONATELY ADVANTAGE STUDENTS ALREADY ABLE TO GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHER STUDENTS AND THEIR NEEDS. IN PARTICULAR LOW INCOME STUDENTS OF COLOR. THE BILL TARGETS -- THOSE STUDENTS WHO HAVE THE CAPACITY TO TAKE THIRTY UNITS -- OF CLASSES PER ACADEMIC YEAR THIS IS FOCUSING ON A VERY NARROW COMPONENT OF THE PROBLEM WELL STUDENTS A STRING LONG TOGETHER CLASSES -- AS THEY'RE ABLE AND STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET -- THEY THESE STUDENTS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE. I AM PART TIME FACULTY AT SACRAMENTO STATE I CAN'T THINK OF A SINGLE SEMESTER WHERE I HAVEN'T HAD TO TURN AWAY STUDENTS BECAUSE THEY'RE LITERALLY WASN'T A SEED LEFT IN THE CLASS OR BECAUSE THE CLASS WAS FULL AND I ALREADY HAD TEN TO FIFTEEN STUDENTS. WANTED TO ADD MY CLASS. IT'S HEART WRENCHING TO TURN DISTANCE AWAY. THE PROGRAM THIS PROGRAM AS AS CREATED COULD BUMP LOW INCOME STUDENTS FROM CLASSES ADVANTAGES STUDENTS WHO ARE NOT LOW INCOME -- THROUGH PRIORITY REGISTRATION -- THE STUDENTS HAVE PLENTY OF FLEXIBILITY AND WHEN THEY COULD TAKE CLASSES WERE AS LOW INCOME STUDENTS THAT HAVE TO WORK MAKE. DO NOT HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY WE WOULD URGE THE BIRDS LEGISLATURE ALONG WITH THE CSU TO WORK TOWARD SOLUTIONS THAT BENEFIT ALL STUDENTS. SUCH AS REDUCING THE COST OF HIGHER EDUCATION FOR ALL STUDENTS OR OFFERING MORE CLASSES -- TO HELP STUDENTS MEET GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS AN INCREASING ADDITIONAL SUPPORT AND RESOURCES SUCH AS MENTAL HEALTH COST OF HOUSING AND FOOD TO HELP THE CSU MORE EFFECTIVELY HELP STUDENTS ATTAIN THEIR DEGREE. WE HAVE SHARED WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE -- THAT IF HE WOULD BE WILLING TO HAVE ALL OF THE BENEFITS BOTH FINANCIAL AND REGISTRATION APPLY TO LOW INCOME STUDENTS -- THAT WE WOULD REMOVE OPPOSITION THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. OKAY VERY GOOD WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE BEFORE I OPEN IT UP TO THE COMMITTEE I JUST LIKE TO SAY CENTER GLAZER APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR WORK ON THIS BILL -- I AM GOING TO VOTE YESTERDAY BUT RESERVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE NO ON THE FLOOR IF WE DON'T COME A LITTLE FARTHER I DO STILL WORRY ABOUT SOME OF THE EQUITY ISSUES. AND SOME OF THE ISSUES RAISED BY CFA -- BUT HAPPY TO SUPPORTED TODAY SO THAT YOU CAN CONTINUE WORKING ON IT. OTHERS ON THE IN FROM THE COMMITTEE SENATOR DORADO. YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I'D LIKE TO SHARE OF THE CONCERNS THAT YOU HAVE REYES I'VE. SPOKEN WITH CENTER GLAZER -- IT PUTS ME IN FEELS LIKE A BIG DILEMMA IT'S ALMOST LIKE I'M CHOOSING SOME OVER OTHERS WHICH SHOULDN'T BE THE CASE. IN PUBLIC EDUCATION TO BE EVERYBODY ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN DEPRIVED. SO -- I HAVE MORE MORE MEN MORE QUESTIONS I'M NOT SURE THAT ALL COULD BE COULD BE ANSWERED BUT IN PARTICULAR HOW THE CURRENT PROGRAM. HAS IMPACTED WHO ARE THE STUDENTS WHO HAVE BENEFITED FROM THE CURRENT PROGRAM. AND HOW DO WE MAKE SURE. THAT MORE OF THOSE STUDENTS ARE GETTING THE SAME ACCESS TO THE CLASSES THAT THEY NEED SO ON THE ONE HAND I LOVE THE IDEA THAT MORE STUDENTS WILL BE ABLETO GRADUATE -- THAT'S FINE I MET WITH STUDENTS SAW -- AND CAL STATE IN THAT AREA AND THAT WAS THEIR BIG ISSUE -- SO I'M REALLY TORN I BELIEVE THAT A WE HAVE TO DO ALL WE CAN TO HELP MORE STUDENTS TO GRADUATE -- BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT AND STILL UNSURE ABOUT ITS IMPACT ON LOW INCOME ON IN CAL STATE LA I THINK THE MAJORITY ARE PROBABLY FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES. SO THOSE WHO WOULD BENEFIT FROM YOUR PROPOSAL I BELIEVE A GOOD NUMBER OF THEM I DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION MAYBE YOU DO WOULD BENEFIT BUT STILL IS THAT MEAN THAT WERE. PUSHING FURTHER BEHIND THOSE WHO ARE STRUGGLING SO MUCH -- TO TO GET THROUGH AND AND TO GRADUATE -- IT BACK WHEN I WENT TO SCHOOL IT WAS. A GIVEN THAT YOU GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS. RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT AND I JUST DON'T YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND EXACTLY YET WHAT'S HAPPENED TO BREAK THAT DOWN -- SO I'M-- I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR YOUR BILL TODAY BUT I HAVE MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS. AND I TO RESPECT A LOT WITH THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION -- IS SAYING AND THE ISSUES THAT THEY RAISED SO I LOOK FORWARD TO FIGURING THOSE THOSE ISSUES OUT. THE USER DRAWS -- YES THE CENTER PM. THANK YOU AND SORRY GLAZER AYE -- MONTH THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I KNOW THAT -- CERTAINLY TRYING TO IN TERMS OF TRYING -- TO TO CAN DO TO GET STUDENTS -- TO GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS TO I KNOW THE SYSTEM'S BEEN WORKING ON THIS AS WELL BECAUSE CERTAINLY EVERY YEAR AS SOON CAN'T GRADUATE TO ESPECIALLY IT'S FOR REASONS IN THE INSTITUTION -- THAT'S MORE EXPENSE FOR BOTH. THE FAMILY AS WELL AS THE ART OUR STATE AND OUR CSU SYSTEM -- I KNOW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS ISSUE BEFORE AND YOU'VE PRESENTED TO REGIONAL CALIFORNIA -- PROMISE I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE AMENDMENTS I GUESS -- AND AND I UNDERSTAND THAT -- THE PRIORITY REGISTRATION IS ACTUALLY IN CURRENT LAW BECAUSE IT'S PART OF WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY PASSED WITH COFFEE PROBLEMS CORRECT AND AND I UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAD THIS THERE IS A THAT THE BASICALLY THERE THE BILL HAS TO RENEW THEIR EXTEND THE THIS IS THIS KIND OF HIGHLIGHT. IN SOME WAYS CORRECT -- AT LEAST THE ORIGINAL ONE I MEAN WE'RE ATTY RIGHT AND SEVEN AND SO. SO I I DO THINK THAT WE NEED I THINK THE BIG CONCERN BEFORE AND YOUR HEARING AID THAT IS AS ABOUT THE EQUITY ISSUES ALL RIGHT -- I THINK THE CHALLENGES WHEN YOU HAVE STUDENTS. TO OUR AND MORE I GUESS UNSTABLE CIRCUMSTANCES -- MAY HAVE -- WHO WHO WHO WHO WHO MAY NOT HAVE THE KIND OF SUPPORTS WHAT I FEEL LIKE THEY CAN MAKE A COMMITMENT THAT THEY WOULD ACTUALLY BECAUSE THEY MAY BE PULLED AWAY? JUST MAY HAVE TO GO WORK -- TO MAKE SOME MONEY -- SUPPORT YOU KNOW THEIR FAMILY OR OTHER TYPES OF SITUATIONS -- THE THAT BECOMES A BIT OF A CHALLENGE FOR THEM TO COMMIT ST -- GOING TO GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS AND THEN IF NOW THEY'RE MORE DISADVANTAGE I THINK THAT'S A CONCERN THAT YOU. HEARD SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN LOOK AT THOSE ISSUES -- BEFORE AND HOPEFULLY TO SOME DATA WE CAN BE GATHERED ON THAT -- AS WE LOOK AT THE PROGRAM OVERALL -- WHEN IT COMES BACK FOR YOU KNOW FIGHT MY GUESS EXTENSION OR SOMETHING BUT -- CERTAINLY I THINK -- THE WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING THIS BILL IS -- SOMETHING I CAN SUPPORT TODAY AND WILL -- AND BUT WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AND WHAT HOW THIS IS AFFECTING VARIOUS SUBGROUPS OF STUDENTS AND I'M SURE I AM SURE YOU YOU TO ALSO WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT DATE AS WELL. THANK YOU. USER PAN SENATOR WILK. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I HAVE COMPLETE CONFIDENCE IN YOU AS AN AUTHOR AND I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA CONTINUE WORK WITH THE OTHER SIDE AND DO WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF STUDENTS. I SEE THIS AND WE'RE GETTING STUDENTS ARE QUICKER AT THAT OPENS UP SEATS -- AND FRANKLY I THOUGHT IT WAS A CO AUTHOR THIS BILL SO IT DOESN'T HURT YOU I'D LIKE TO BE AT AS A CO AUTHOR WHEN WHEN APPROPRIATE. AND I KNOW YOU CONTINUE WORK WITH THE OTHER SIDE AND I I KNOW WHAT'S IN YOUR HEART I KNOW IT'S ALL ABOUT STUDENT ACCESS AND SUCCESS SO. I'M HAPPY SPORTY TODAY AND I'M GOING TO SUPPORT ON THE FLOORS WHILE. THANK YOU SENATOR WILK SURVEYS WHICH LIKE CLOTHES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR YOUR THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS -- THERE ARE SOME MISUNDERSTANDINGS ABOUT THE ORIGINAL PROMISE PROGRAM. THE FOCUS ON THAT PROGRAM IS ON THE LOW INCOME STUDENTS THE UNDERSERVED THE FIRST AND THEIR FAMILIES AFFECTED IN THE LAW. THAT I CAMPUS BASED COMMITTEES ARE THE ONES THAT. THE ONLY DIRECTION THAT THEY GIVE TO THOSE CAMPUS BASED COMMITTEES THAT THEY MUST GIVE PRIORITY TO THOSE STUDENTS. AND THAT ANY OTHER STUDENT DOESN'T FIT THAT CATEGORY. I DOES NESTLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE IN THE PROMISE PROGRAM. THEY HAVE FULL CONTROL OVER WHO IS ALLOWED IN AND WHO'S NOT AND THE CRITERIA IS VERY CLEAR. YOU HAVE TO BE A LOW INCOME STUDENT. YOU HAVE -- TO BE UNDER REPRESENTED. AND YOU HAVE TO BE A FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENT OR A TRANSFER STUDENT. SO THE FOCUS OF THE PROGRAM FROM THE START HAS ALWAYS BEEN ON THE STUDENTS WHO HAVE THE MOST NEED AND IT CONTINUES TO BE. MY CENTRAL GOAL AND I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING THAT INTERFERES WITH THAT. REGISTRATION FOR CLASSES ON I THINK ON ALL CAMPUSES IS BASED ON HOW FAR YOU ARE A LONG AND GETTING TO A DEGREE. AND IF YOU'RE A SENIOR AND YOU'RE NOT IN THE PROMISE PROGRAM. I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE THE HIGHEST REGISTRATION PRIORITY BECAUSE OF YOUR UNIT COUNT IT'S JUST WHAT HAPPENS ON THE CAMPUSES IN GENERAL. AND SO THE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW THIS IS GOING TO HOLD BACK SOMEBODY WHO IS NOT IN THE PROMISE PROGRAM THAT'S UNDER REPRESENTED -- POOR IT'S JUST NOT TRUE. IT'S JUST NOT TRUE. NOW DO WE HAVE INSTITUTIONAL ISSUES ON THE CAMPUS OF MAKING CLASSES AVAILABLE YES WE DO THAT'S A BROADER ISSUE. GOES BEYOND THIS THIS BILL AND CERTAINLY. THE ONLY REQUIREMENT OF THIS BILL IS THAT IT CREATES INCENTIVES FOR THE CAMPUS TO AVOID THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT TO PROVIDE THOSE CLASSES IT AT NO COST. BUT THE CSU IS SUCH A IT'S SUCH A MIRACLE PLACE FOR OUR OUR OUR LOW INCOME KIDS YOU KNOW THAT GRADUATE SEES ME QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL AID. BY DEFINITION 75% ARE OF THE LOWER INCOME. THAT FITS THE CRITERIA THE PROMISE PROGRAM LAST YEAR 60% OF OUR GRADUATES FROM THE CSU OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND FIRST IN THEIR FAMILY TO GRADUATE IT'S AN IT'S A MIRACLE PLACE. FOR SO MANY TO GIVE THEM THIS GREAT ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING THAT DOES ANYTHING BUT SUPPORT THAT CONTINUED WONDERFUL MIRACLE FROM CONTINUING OKAY -- AND I THINK THAT THIS BILL IS NARROWLY FOCUSED -- BUT I CERTAINLY FROM THE COULD CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED EARLIER -- I AYE ARE WERE LINES ON WHAT WE WANT TO ACCOMPLISH. THESE ARE THESE ARE SMALL STEPS THAT WE'RE TAKING OUT OF A LARGER DESIRE TO HAVE THESE KIDS BE SUCCESSFUL AND NOT HAVE TO WASTE THOSE. HIGH SCHOOL SCORES THEIR COLLEGE ADMISSIONS THE LOANS ALL THOSE THINGS. BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT FOLKS. THIS YEAR TENS OF THOUSANDS ARE GONNA DROP OUT. WITH ALL THAT DATA IF THEY HAVE IT AND NOT HAVE A DEGREE WE GOT IT WE GOT TO DO BETTER I KNOW THE FACULTY AND THE ADMINISTRATION AND STUDENT LEADERSHIP IS COMMITTED TO MAKING A DIFFERENCE THERE. AND THESE ARE PART OF OUR EFFORTS TO TRY TO DO THAT THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER WE HAVE A MOTION. SO MOVED THANK YOU SENATOR WILK MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME HERE TODAY -- THE LEGISLATURE HAS ALREADY TRUSTED SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO AWARD CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS AHEAD OF STATE ARCHITECT APPROVAL OF DRAWINGS AND SPECIFICATIONS IF THEY USE THEIR LEASE BACK OR DESIGN BUILD AUTHORITY SO THIS IS NOT A NEW. PROCESS WE WANT TO AND I ACTUALLY SERVED ON THAT TASK FORCE THAT WAS MENTIONED WE WANT TO GIVE THIS TOOL TO THE DISTRICTS FOR THE PERHAPS. THIRTY OR FORTY THOUSAND CONTRACTS THAT ARE AWARDED EACH YEAR FOR THE MORE ROUTINE KINDS OF PROJECTS NEW WINDOWS AROUND THE CAMPUS FOR BETTER ENERGY EFFICIENCY RE ROOFING -- FOR THE FLOORING -- CAMPUS WIDE THESE ARE THE MEAT AND POTATOES KIND OF PROJECTS THAT ARE WARDED TRADITIONAL HARD BID -- BASED ON PLANS AND SPECS STAMP BY PROFESSIONAL ARCHITECTS -- THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW SOME THAT PRELIMINARY WORK TO BE DONE KIND OF STRATEGICALLY IF THE DISTRICT WANTED TO AWARD THE CONTRACT BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW SUMMERS ARE GETTING SHORTER AND SHORTER. IN THE SCHOOL VACATION PERIOD SO IF WE COULD GET ALL THOSE SUBCONTRACTS AWARDED MATERIALS AND EVERYTHING STAGE THEN AS SOON AS THE STATE ARCHITECT HAS APPROVED THE PLANS AND SPECS AND THE BELL RINGS IN THE KIDS RUN OUT. THEN OUR CONSTRUCTION CRAFTSMAN CAN COME RIGHT IN AND HAVE A MORE SUCCESSFUL PROJECT HIGHER QUALITY PROJECT WITHOUT RUSHING IN AND TRYING TO DO -- QUICK FIXES SO THAT'S THE IDEA I REALLY LIKE THAT THE BILL PROTECTS THE FIELD ACT REQUIREMENT THAT NO CONSTRUCTION. CAN TAKE PLACE UNTIL THE STATE ARCHITECT HAS APPROVED THOSE DRAWINGS AND SPECIFICATIONS. SO I DON'T THINK THE DISTRICTS WILL USE THIS TOOL ON EVERY ONE OF THOSE FIFTY THOUSAND PROJECTS EACH YEAR BUT I TRUST THEM AND THEIR ARCHITECTS AND THEIR ATTORNEYS. TO CHOOSE WHICH PROJECTS WOULD HAVE A GOOD FIT FOR THIS IDEA OF EARLY PRELIMINARY WORK. I ALSO TRUST THEM HAVING BEEN A BUILDER FOR THEM FOR YEARS -- TO FIGURE OUT GOOD LANGUAGE PROJECT BY PROJECT TO MAKE SURE THAT CHANGE ORDERS ARE FAIRLY ADDRESSED -- IF THERE ARE -- CHANGES THAT ARE REQUIRED THAT WORK REFLECTED IN THE BID DOCUMENTS SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT I'LL BE GLAD TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SIR OTHERS IN SUPPORT. OKAY COME ON UP. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MARC CHRISTIAN WITH THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ARCHITECTS CALIFORNIA. WE ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS MEASURE. TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF SCHOOL FACILITIES THE MODERNIZATION OF SCHOOL FACILITIES FOR NOT QUITE IN SUPPORT YET WE'RE WORKING WITH THE SPONSOR. TO ADDRESS THE CONCERN WE HAVE IN THAT CONCERN IS ONE THAT -- WE BELIEVE THIS POTENTIALLY COULD INCREASE THE ARCHITECTS FINANCIAL RISK RIGHT NOW. CONSTRUCTION IS BASED UPON THE APPROVED. SAID OF CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTS APPROVED BY THE DIVISION OF THE STATE ARCHITECT UNDER THIS PROPOSAL BIDDING WILL TAKE PLACE ON THOSE PLANS SUBMITTED TO TSA. AND NOT YET APPROVED IF THE APPROVED DOCUMENTS FROM DSA. HAVE A HIGHER COST OF CONSTRUCTION WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT HIGHER COST IS NOT. PUT ON TO THE DESK OF THE ARCHITECT THROUGH A CHANGE ORDER BECAUSE AGAIN AS IT IS TODAY IT'S THE APPROVED SET OF DOCUMENTS. THAT IS THE COST OF CONSTRUCTION THAT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY THE SCHOOL DISTRICT WE DON'T WANT THIS TO CREATE A PROCESS WHERE. THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO HAVE THE CONTRACTOR OR TRY TO HAVE THE ARCHITECT TAKE ON THIS ADDITIONAL COST OF CONSTRUCTION THAT RESULTS FROM DSA REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF THOSE PLANS. AND WE'RE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORED TO ACHIEVE THAT LANGUAGE THANK YOU VERY GOOD THANK YOU SIR OTHERS IN PEER SUPPORT. ON THE WITH THE SACRAMENTO REGIONAL BUILDERS EXCHANGE ON BEHALF OF OUR ELEVEN HUNDRED MEMBER COMPANIES MANY OF WHOM HAVE -- EDUCATIONAL FACILITY -- DIVISIONS WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. OKAY VERY GOOD WE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS. CENTER PARISH LIKE TO CLOSE YES WHEN I VOTE WONDERFUL SOMEONE LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR GLAZER -- MAN SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ITEM FIVE SB TWO NINETY SEVEN THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS LEYVA. BY LEYVA AYE WILK AYE WILK I CHIANG WHO ASAL. WRESTLE AYE GLAZER GLAZER AYE MCGUIRE PAN. AND I THE BILL HAS FOUR OF THAT BILLS FOR VOTES WE WILL -- KEEP IT OPEN FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT HERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT -- MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN TURN IT OVER TO YOU SO THAT WE CAN HEAR THE LAST BILL. THE WRITER NEXT ITEM WILL BE ITEM FOR SB TWO NINETY ONE BY CENTER LEYVA THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS. SENATOR LEYVA THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR GOOD MORNING MEMBERS I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND THANK THE STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL MUCH APPRECIATED. FOR NEARLY SIXTY YEARS THE MASTER PLAN FOR HIGHER EDUCATION HAS GUARANTEED THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO COLLEGE. MOST STUDENTS NEARLY TWO POINT TWO MILLION ANNUALLY INCLUDING THE VAST MAJORITY OF FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS AND STUDENTS OF COLOR. ACCESS OUR PROMISE TO HIGHER EDUCATION THROUGH ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES. BY MYSELF CERTAIN OF MY COLLEGE CAREER AT MOUNT SAN ANTONIO COLLEGE AND WHILE THE CALIFORNIA. ALTHOUGH THE MASTER PLAN PROVIDES A COMMITMENT TO COLLEGE ACCESS STATE HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING POLICY REINFORCES DEEPLY CONCERNING INEQUITIES FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. CALLER COMMUNICABLE EDGE. EXCUSE ME CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COLLEGES SERVE THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS IN THE STATE YET THEY RECEIVE THE LOWEST PER STUDENT FUNDING LEVEL OF ANY OF THE STATE'S EDUCATION SEGMENTS. AS A STATE WE HAVE MADE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS IN REMOVING FINANCIAL BARRIERS TO HIGHER EDUCATION INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE GRANT AND ITS EFFORTS TO MAKE TO YOUR COLLEGE IT TWO YEARS OF COLLEGE FREE. APPROXIMATELY 43% OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS HAVE THEIR TUITION WAVED UNDER THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE GRANT. EVEN SO. COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE OFTEN THE LEAST AFFORDABLE OPTION FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS WHEN THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE IS FACTORED IN. THE REAL COST OF COLLEGE IS MORE THAN JUST TUITION. IT INCLUDES NON TUITION EXPENSES SUCH AS HOUSING TEXTBOOKS TRANSPORTATION AND FOOD WHICH CAN EXCEED NINETEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY. THESE HIGH NON TUITION COSTS MAKE SUCCEEDING IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT FOR LOWER INCOME STUDENTS. NEED BASED FINANCIAL AID TO COVER NON TUITION COSTS IS SO LIMITED FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS THAT IT IS OFTEN MORE EXPENSIVE FOR THE LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS TO ATTEND. A CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE THEN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA I PERSONALLY FOUND THAT SHOCKING WHEN I FOUND OUT. THIS LACK OF AFFORDABILITY IS UNACCEPTABLE AND WE OWE OUR FUTURE LEADERS SO MUCH MORE. SB TWO NINETY ONE CREATES THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM TO MAKE A MEANINGFUL COMMITMENT TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY. MANY COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS HAVE TO SUPPORT MORE -- BALLOTS WORKING MULTIPLE JOBS TO MAKE ENDS MEET SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES ALL WHILE PURSUING THEIR HIGHER EDUCATION GOALS. RESEARCH HAS ALSO SHOWN THAT THIS ADDITIONAL SOURCE OF STRESS CAN LEAD TO LOWER ACADEMIC -- PERFORMANCE AND HIGHER DROPOUT RATES THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COLLEGE FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM WOULD HELP STUDENTS REDUCE STUDENT LOAN DEBT AND THE NEED FOR MULTIPLE JOBS WILL WORK WHILE ALLOWING THEM TO COMPLETE THE PROGRAMS ON TIME. TO AND VERY SIGNIFICANT AND MORE EQUITABLE INVESTMENT AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES STUDENTS FINANCIALLY PACKAGES MUST SUPPORT THE TOTAL COST OF COLLEGE. UNTIL COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO MORE FINANCIAL AID TO HELP WITH NANTWICH TUITION COSTS. A COMPLETE COLLEGE PROMISE IN CALIFORNIA WILL NOT BE ACHIEVED. HERE WITH ME IN SUPPORT IS VALERIE JOHNSON PRESIDENT OF CRAFTON HILLS COLLEGE STUDENTS SENATE. AND JOHN LONG BILL PRESIDENT OF THE SAM BIRD IN A COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND SOME OF OUR STUDENTS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. WHOEVER WANTS TO START PLEASE PROCEED. LARA MATTOON ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS WITH THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL -- I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS I'D LIKE TO RESERVE THE BALANCE OF TIME TO HEAR FROM OUR STUDENTS IN COLLEGE LEADERS THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS VALERIE JOHNSON I'M A STUDENT AT CRAFTING HILL COLLEGE -- WHERE I STUDY POLITICAL SCIENCE AND SOCIAL SCIENCES AND I'M ALSO STUDENT ADVOCATE WITH RICE A STUDENT LED ORGANIZATION FIGHTING TO RESTORE THE PROMISE OF PUBLIC EDUCATE EDUCATION IN? CALIFORNIA -- AS A COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT WHO HAS HAD TO NAVIGATE THE FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM LARGELY ON MY OWN I'VE LEARNED THAT THE MAIN SOURCE OF THE COLLEGE COSTS THAT I HAVE. COME TO FACE IS NOT TUITION BUT EVERYTHING ELSE -- SO LIKE 46% OF OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS I RECEIVE NEED BASED FINANCIAL AID. AND THAT COVERS MY TUITION COSTS BUT WHEN YOU FACTOR IN NON TUITION COSTS -- OF ATTENDING COLLEGE LIKE BOOKS TRANSPORTATION HOUSING AND FOOD THE TOTAL COST TO ATTEND COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAN SOMETIMES EXCEED NINETEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY. A SEMESTER I WAS WORKING THREE JOBS ALL PARTICIPATING IN STUDENT GOVERNMENT AND TAKING A FIFTEEN UNIT COURSE LOAD SPREAD OUT BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT COLLEGES. I CAME CLOSE TO DROPPING MY FULL TIME STATUS JUST SO THAT I COULD QUIT MAYBE EVEN ONE OF MY JOBS AND FOCUS ON MY SCHOOL WORK. I WAS OVERWHELMED I WAS DESPERATE AND I WAS WORKING SO HARD BECAUSE I WANTED TO SERVE MY COMMUNITY AND PREPARE TO TRANSFER TO A FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITY. BUT JUGGLING MULTIPLE JOBS AT THE SAME TIME MADE THE WORKLOAD UNSUSTAINABLE. SO THIS IS NOT UNCOMMON AT ALL AND NON TUITION COSTS A COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAN BE SO HIGH THAT SOME STUDENTS TAKE SEVERAL YEARS TO COMPLETE. AND CALIFORNIA HAS THE LOWEST COMMUNITY COLLEGE TUITION IN THE NATION AND NEARLY HALF STUDENTS PAY NO TUITION WHICH IS REALLY GREAT. BUT IT ISN'T ENOUGH WHEN TEXTBOOKS RENT FOOD CHILD CARE AND MORE PRESENT THE LARGEST AND MOST DAUNTING AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES. THANKS TO RESEARCH FROM INSTITUTE FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS WE CAN NOW SAY FOR CERTAIN THAT AFTER FACTORING TOTAL COSTS IN OF ATTENDANCE. AND GRANT AID THE NET COST OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS ACTUALLY MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT THE SENATOR MENTIONED -- EVERY STUDENT WHO WISHES TO ATTEND COLLEGE AND PURSUE THEIR EDUCATION REGARDLESS OF THEIR INCOME OR FAMILY HISTORY OR WHETHER THEY BEGIN AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DESERVES THE OPPORTUNITY. TO DO SO SB TWO NINETY ONE IS ESSENTIAL TO PROVIDING EQUITY TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS AND HELPING STUDENTS REACH COMPLETION OF THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS. WHETHER THEY DO THAT TO OBTAIN A CERTIFICATE TO TRANSFER TO A FOUR YEAR INSTITUTION TO RECEIVE VOCATIONAL TRAINING OR ENHANCE THEIR PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE. COMMUNITY COLLEGES ENROLL MORE INCUR LOW INCOMES DOING STAND AT SEE MORE LOW INCOME PELL GRANT RECIPIENTS AND CSU UC AND NONPROFIT COLLEGES COMBINED. AND WE OWE IT TO THOSE STUDENTS TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO HELP THEM COMPLETE AND RIGHT NOW THE BEST THING FOR THEM IS OFFERED THEM SUPPORT IN NON TUITION COSTS LIKE IS PROPOSED IN THIS BILL. THANK YOU. HELLO THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME MY NAME IS I USUALLY YOUNG BLOOD AND I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE STUDENT SENATE FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHICH REPRESENTS THE TWO POINT ONE MILLION STUDENTS IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. ON AVERAGE IT TAKES A COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT FIVE POINT TWO YEARS TO GRADUATE A TRANSFER FROM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM THE TUITION AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM IS THE LOWEST IN THE NATION. BUT THE COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT IT'S ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND IN A REPORT DONE BY THE INSTITUTE FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS. DOCTOR OUT NINE REGIONS IN CALIFORNIA COMPARING THE LOCAL YOU SEE SEE ISSUES AND CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE IT SHOWS. THAT IT WAS MORE TRANSIT TO TEND TO CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN A FOUR YEAR INSTITUTE ONE OF THE BIGGEST FACTORS FOR THIS. EIGHT FOUR THIS IS THE EIGHT THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS MAKE UP TWO THIRDS OF THIS COLLEGE STUDENTS IN THE STATE YET CURRENTLY COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS RECEIVED 7% OF THECAL GRANT FUNDING. AND UNLIKE UC AND CSU SYSTEM. WE DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO OFFER INSTITUTIONAL EIGHT WHICH LEAVES OUR STUDENTS WORKING LONG HOURS. TO COVER THIS NEED OR SIMPLY GOING WITHOUT A RECENT STUDY PUT OUT BY THE WHOLE LAB SHOWED THAT FORTY THOUSAND STUDENTS SURVEYED 50% WERE FOOD AND SECURE 60% WERE HOUSING IN SECURE AND 19% WERE HOMELESS IN THE LAST YEAR. COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS NEED TO GREATER INVESTMENT IN THE FINANCIAL AID THAT IS OFFERED ESPECIALLY FOR MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS AND THAT IS WHY THE STUDENTS IN IT FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB. TWO NINETY ONE ONE MANAGE. AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M JOHN LONG WILL PRESIDENT OF THE SAN MARINO COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM A COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT RATHER BOARD OF TRUSTEES. AND I CAN'T HELP BUT NOTICE THINGS HAVE CHANGED A LOT SINCE TWO DECADES AGO WHEN I CAME UP HERE TO THE ASSEMBLY. FOR ONE THING THE PEOPLE GIVING TESTIMONY NO LONGER HAVE PIECES OF PAPER. AS MUCH IN USING IPHONES IN THE SENATORS SEEM A LOT YOUNGER BUT DOES. I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT IS. IN ANY WITH THIS MONTH THE NEWS IS FOCUSED ON WEALTHY PARENTS WILLING TO DO JUST ABOUT ANYTHING LEGAL OR OTHERWISE. TO ENSURE THEIR KIDS AN IVY LEAGUE EDUCATION. WE ONLY THE WEALTHIEST OTHERS HAVE THE MEANS TO BUY OUR CHILDREN. THERE STE FUTURES. BUT ALL OUR STUDENTS DESERVE ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION IS THAT THEY WILL NEED TO CHIEF SOCIAL MOBILITY AND ECONOMIC SECURITY. THAT'S WHY CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM PROVIDES. OUR STUDENTS WITH THE KEYS TO UNLOCK ECONOMIC PROSPERITY. WE ARE THE LARGEST WORKFORCE AND TRANSFER PROVIDER IN THE NATION. THIS SYSTEM. REPRESENTS OUR BEST CHANCE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF MOST STUDENTS AND EMPLOYERS WE'RE IN COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE SERVE NEARLY TWO POINT TWO MILLION STUDENTS ANNUALLY. CALIFORNIA POLICY MAKERS HAVE WORKED HARD TO ENSURE THAT TUITION. IS NOT A BARRIER FOR STUDENTS THAT CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. WE OFFER THE LOWEST FEES IN THE NATION FORTY SIX DOLLARS PER UNIT AND WAIVE FEES FOR NEARLY HALF OF ALL STUDENTS. UNDER THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE GRANT. YET FOR FAR TOO MANY OF OUR STUDENTS THE STRUGGLE TO PAY THEIR NON TUITION COSTS. COMPARED TO TRADITIONAL STUDENTS WHO ATTEND UC AND CSU SYSTEMS WERE NEARLY 40% OF THE UNDERGRADUATES RECEIVE THE CAL GRANT. LITTLE GRANT AID IS AVAILABLE TO HELP COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS COVER THE NINE TUITION COSTS WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN DESCRIBED YOU AS AND HOW HEAVY THEY ARE. BECAUSE SO LITTLE GRANT IS AVAILABLE TO COVER -- TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS TO COVER THEIR TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE IT'S ACTUALLY MORE EXPENSIVE FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS AS HAS ALREADY BEEN NOTED BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH REPEATING. IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS TO ATTEND THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES THEN. TO ATTEND THE CLOSEST UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. SENATE BILL TWO NINETY ONE WOULD CORRECT THIS INEQUITY AND CREATE A NEW PROGRAM. A NEW GRANT PROGRAM TO HELP OUR LOW INCOME STUDENTS COVER THEIR TOTAL COST TO ATTEND AND SUCCEEDED OR COLLEGES. THIS WOULD HELP STUDENTS ELIMINATE LOAN DEBT IN REDUCE EXCESSIVE WORK OBLIGATIONS GIVING THEM THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO COMPLETE THEIR PROGRAMS ON TIME. IS COLLEGES WE UNDERSTAND OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS. SB TRUE NINETY ONE WOULD ENSURE THAT COLLEGES IMPLEMENT EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES. THAT SUPPORT STUDENTS LIKE. DUAL ENROLLMENT EARLY OUT REACHED AYE SCHOOLS BASIC SKILLS REFORMS AND GUIDED PATHWAYS WERE DOING THOSE THINGS IN OUR DISTRICT AND AND MOST DISTRICTS DO. COLLEGES WOULD ALSO BE REQUIRED TO ENSURE STUDENTS COMPLETE THEIR STAFFS OUR CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT APPLICATION IN DRAW DOWN AS MUCH EXISTING FEDERAL AND STATE GRANTED AS POSSIBLE. SB NINETY ONE INSURERS A MEANINGFUL COMMITMENT TO COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY FOR OUR STUDENTS AND WOOD I WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR VOIGTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
