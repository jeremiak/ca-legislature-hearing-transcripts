BILLION DOLLARS. OF THIS AMOUNT

00:39:58.262 --> 00:39:59.430
LOST REVENUE REPRESENTS TWO

00:40:01.599 --> 00:40:02.900
EXTRAORDINARY COSTS RELATED TO

FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS.

00:40:07.271 --> 00:40:08.205
REVENUE LOSSES HAVE BEEN

00:40:08.272 --> 00:40:09.540
PRIMARILY FELT BY OUR MEDICAL

00:40:09.607 --> 00:40:12.143
CENTERS IN IN OUR AUXILIARY

00:40:12.209 --> 00:40:12.743
OPERATIONS SUCH AS HOUSING AND

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:15.279
DINING. ADDITIONAL EXPENSES

00:40:15.346 --> 00:40:17.681
INCLUDING TECHNOLOGY PP

ADDITIONAL CLEANING TESTING AND

00:40:19.416 --> 00:40:21.118
TRACING INFRASTRUCTURE. WHICH

00:40:21.185 --> 00:40:22.853
WILL LIKELY GROW AS CAMPUSES

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:24.455
SPEND MILLIONS ON TESTING EVERY

00:40:24.522 --> 00:40:26.457
MONTH TO ENSURE THE HEALTH AND

00:40:26.524 --> 00:40:27.024
WELL BEING OF THE UNIVERSITY

00:40:27.091 --> 00:40:29.426
COMMUNITY. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED

00:40:29.493 --> 00:40:30.995
A RELATIVELY QUICK RECOVERY IN

00:40:31.061 --> 00:40:32.663
OUR MEDICAL CENTERS WITH

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:34.799
AVERAGE NUMBER OF PATIENTS

00:40:34.865 --> 00:40:35.366
NEARLY EQUALING PRE COVERED

00:40:35.432 --> 00:40:37.201
RATES. HOWEVER WE REMAIN

00:40:37.268 --> 00:40:38.936
CAUTIOUS ABOUT THIS RECOVERY AS

00:40:39.003 --> 00:40:40.304
WE WATCH CASES ACROSS THE

00:40:40.371 --> 00:40:42.907
COUNTRY AND IN CALIFORNIA SPIKE

00:40:42.973 --> 00:40:44.675
TO RECORD HIGHS. OUR MEDICAL

00:40:44.742 --> 00:40:46.110
CENTERS ARE TAKING EXTRA STEPS

00:40:46.177 --> 00:40:47.044
TO ENSURE WE HAVE SUFFICIENT

00:40:47.111 --> 00:40:49.713
CAPACITY IF WE EXPERIENCE A

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:51.715
SIMILAR SURGE THIS WINTER.

00:40:51.782 --> 00:40:53.217
DURING THIS TIME WE WERE ABLE

00:40:53.284 --> 00:40:53.984
TO GROW OUR TELEMEDICINE

00:40:54.051 --> 00:40:56.020
PLATFORM IN CANAL PROVIDE

00:40:56.086 --> 00:40:57.688
EXPANDED MEDICAL CARE TO

00:40:57.755 --> 00:40:59.824
PATIENTS IN MORE RURAL AND

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:01.826
UNDERSERVED AREAS OF THE STATE.

00:41:01.892 --> 00:41:02.793
STILL WE ARE UNLIKELY TO

00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:04.228
RECOVER LOST REVENUE DURING

00:41:04.295 --> 00:41:06.230
REDUCED OPERATIONS AND THIS

00:41:06.297 --> 00:41:06.864
WILL REDUCE THE MEDICAL CENTER

00:41:06.931 --> 00:41:09.033
RESERVES. THESE RESERVES COULD

00:41:09.099 --> 00:41:10.868
HAVE BEEN SPENT ON OTHER

00:41:10.935 --> 00:41:11.402
PRIORITIES SUCH AS SEISMIC

00:41:11.468 --> 00:41:14.471
RETROFITS. HOUSING A DYING

00:41:14.538 --> 00:41:15.706
REVENUE ON THE OTHER HAND HAS

00:41:15.773 --> 00:41:17.208
NOT SEEN THE SAME RECOVERY IS

00:41:17.274 --> 00:41:18.442
THE MEDICAL CENTERS GIVEN THE

00:41:18.509 --> 00:41:20.277
REDUCED NUMBER OF STUDENTS

00:41:20.344 --> 00:41:22.379
LIVING ON CAMPUS. GENERALLY

00:41:22.446 --> 00:41:23.581
SPEAKING WE ARE LIMITING IT

00:41:23.647 --> 00:41:25.516
LIMITING OCCUPANCY TO ONE

00:41:25.583 --> 00:41:27.051
STUDENT PER BEDROOM. WHERE

00:41:27.117 --> 00:41:29.053
THERE IS A COMMUNAL BATHROOM.

00:41:29.119 --> 00:41:30.955
AND WITH A SLIGHTLY HIGHER

00:41:31.021 --> 00:41:31.488

00:41:31.555 --> 00:41:33.958

00:41:34.024 --> 00:41:35.993
CAMPUS FROM A LOW OF 10%

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:39.330
OCCUPANCY TO HIRE 57% DEPENDING

00:41:39.396 --> 00:41:40.631
ON THE TYPES OF HOUSING ON THE

00:41:40.698 --> 00:41:44.001
CAMPUS HOUSING POP PORTFOLIO.

00:41:44.068 --> 00:41:45.603
AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS.

00:41:45.669 --> 00:41:47.071
THE DEMAND FOR HOUSING REMAINS

00:41:47.137 --> 00:41:48.405
VERY STRONG AND WE EXPECT THAT

00:41:48.472 --> 00:41:50.140
HOW I CAN SEE IN THESE REVENUES

00:41:50.207 --> 00:41:52.810
WILL QUICKLY REBOUND WHEN IT IS

00:41:52.877 --> 00:41:53.377
SAFE TO BRING MORE STUDENTS

00:41:53.444 --> 00:41:55.913
BACK TO CAMPUS. WE ALSO FACE

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:58.015
STRUCTURAL FINANCIAL CHALLENGES

00:41:58.082 --> 00:41:58.649
AND ANTICIPATE A LONGER TIME TO

00:41:58.716 --> 00:42:00.851
RECOVER. THE UNIVERSITY

00:42:00.918 --> 00:42:01.986
RECEIVED A THREE HUNDRED

00:42:02.052 --> 00:42:03.187
BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET CUTS FROM

00:42:03.254 --> 00:42:05.222
THE STATE THIS YEAR. AND THIS

00:42:05.289 --> 00:42:06.557
PANDEMIC RECESSION IS

00:42:06.624 --> 00:42:07.925
DIFFERENT- THAN WHAT WE FACED

00:42:07.992 --> 00:42:09.326
DURING THE GREAT RECESSION WHEN

00:42:09.393 --> 00:42:10.761
WE WERE ABLE TO LEVERAGE THE

00:42:10.828 --> 00:42:11.729
STRENGTH OF OUR OTHER REVENUE

00:42:11.795 --> 00:42:13.530

RESEARCH ENTERPRISE AS BUDGET

00:42:17.868 --> 00:42:19.370
CUTS WERE MADE BY THE STATE. WE

00:42:19.436 --> 00:42:20.437
HAVE TAKEN A NUMBER OF

00:42:20.504 --> 00:42:22.506
PROACTIVE STEPS TO MITIGATE THE

00:42:26.143 --> 00:42:27.711
TO MINIMIZE ADVERSE IMPACTS ON

00:42:27.778 --> 00:42:29.613
JOBS WHICH WILL BE CRITICAL TO

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.815
THE STATE YOU'RE COVERED. YOU

DECLINE TO A 4% DECLINE ACROSS

01:08:38.848 --> 01:08:40.082
THE CAMPUSES. ARE

01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:42.318

01:08:45.521 --> 01:08:47.323
RETURNING STUDENTS WHO DECIDED

01:08:47.389 --> 01:08:48.357
THAT THEY DID NOT WANT TO DO IT

01:08:48.424 --> 01:08:50.159
REMOTELY. AND DID NOT RETURN TO

YOU KNOW ONE OF OUR- OUR

01:08:56.298 --> 01:08:57.299
SEMESTER CAMPUSES SO THEY

01:08:57.366 --> 01:08:59.502
STARTED EARLIER THAN THE

01:08:59.568 --> 01:09:01.470
QUARTER CAMPUSES. THEY SAW

01:09:01.537 --> 01:09:03.706
DECLINE ARE BOTH IN RETURNING-

01:09:03.772 --> 01:09:04.707
NONRESIDENT STUDENTS

01:09:04.773 --> 01:09:05.774
PARTICULARLY INTERNATIONAL

01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:07.543
STUDENTS AND ALSO IN SOME OF

01:09:07.610 --> 01:09:10.112
THE ONE YEAR. MASTER'S PROGRAMS

01:09:10.179 --> 01:09:13.315
THAT WERE. VERY POPULAR WITH-

01:09:13.382 --> 01:09:14.683
SOME OF THEIR INTERNATIONAL

01:09:14.750 --> 01:09:18.454
STUDENTS. ARE THE- OTHER

01:09:18.521 --> 01:09:20.256
CAMPUSES THAT HAVE NOT SEEN AS

01:09:20.322 --> 01:09:21.924
BIG AS A CLIENT THE ONLY OTHER

01:09:21.991 --> 01:09:23.692
ONE THAT HAS A SIMILAR DECLINE

01:09:23.759 --> 01:09:26.161
IS UC IRVINE. BUT THEY HAVE

01:09:26.228 --> 01:09:27.930
ACTUALLY HAD A VERY BIG CLASS

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:29.398
FOUR YEARS EARLIER AND SO THEY

01:09:29.465 --> 01:09:31.500
WERE DEIBERATELY ARE REDUCING

01:09:31.567 --> 01:09:34.203
THEIR- THAT THE NUMBER OF- OF

01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:37.239
STUDENTS- BUT AGAIN IT'S BEEN

01:09:37.306 --> 01:09:39.341
YOU KNOW. MUCH LESS THAN WE HAD

01:09:39.408 --> 01:09:40.943
PROJECTED- IN THE RANGE OF

01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:44.346
ABOUT 224% DECLINE- ED ANYONE

01:09:44.413 --> 01:09:47.116
ANYONE GIVING CAMPUS. ALL RIGHT

01:09:47.182 --> 01:09:49.084
SO AT AND WE KNOW WE HAVE A NON

01:09:49.151 --> 01:09:54.490
RESIDENT. POLICY HERE IN

01:09:54.557 --> 01:09:55.224
CALIFORNIA THAT. WE WORKED ON A

01:09:55.291 --> 01:09:55.824
YEARS AGO WITH YOU IT MYSELF

01:09:55.891 --> 01:09:56.559
TANG THINK THAT'S A FAIR.

01:09:56.625 --> 01:09:57.793
COMPROMISE CAME UP WITH IT'S

01:09:57.860 --> 01:09:59.361
NOT NECESSARILY A CAP UT IT'S

01:09:59.428 --> 01:10:03.065
R. RATIO SO. ESSENTIALLY EVERY-

01:10:03.132 --> 01:10:04.833
YOU KNOW NON RESIDENT STUDENT

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:06.435
YOU ENROLL WE WANT TO THE ROLE

01:10:06.502 --> 01:10:08.504
ROUGHLY YOU KNOW THREE. THREE

01:10:08.571 --> 01:10:09.605
OR FOUR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS

01:10:09.672 --> 01:10:12.474
DEPENDING ON YOUR CAMPUS- SO IS

01:10:12.541 --> 01:10:15.511
IT IS THAT YOU KNOW. APPLES TO

01:10:15.578 --> 01:10:17.246
ORANGES WORKS APPLES TO APPLES

01:10:17.313 --> 01:10:18.814
WHEN WE CAN LOOK AT.

01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:21.884
POTENTIALLY FEWER NON RESIDENTS

01:10:21.951 --> 01:10:25.220
DOES THAT AT ALL. EXPAND SPACE

01:10:25.287 --> 01:10:27.389
OR CAPACITY FOR CALIFORNIA

01:10:27.456 --> 01:10:29.158
STUDENTS BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN.

01:10:29.224 --> 01:10:30.559
THAT IS ALWAYS THE ISSUE THAT

WE HERE WE GO HOME TO OUR

01:10:32.227 --> 01:10:33.896

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. BUT

01:10:42.004 --> 01:10:43.639
WE WILL CERTAINLY SEE THE RATIO.

01:10:43.706 --> 01:10:45.608
AS WE SAW NEARLY IN TWO

01:10:45.674 --> 01:10:49.144
THOUSAND- TWO THOUSAND

01:10:49.211 --> 01:10:50.379
INCREASING CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS

01:10:50.446 --> 01:10:53.682

BY CAMPUS AND SO ON I WILL BLOW

01:11:03.759 --> 01:11:06.562
THE OVERALL HE PERCENT CASH

01:11:06.629 --> 01:11:08.530
THAT SHOULD FALL MORE IN EACH

01:11:08.597 --> 01:11:10.599
OF THE CAMPUSES ARE ABOVE THAT

01:11:10.666 --> 01:11:17.239
WILL SEE THEIR RATIO. ON AND

01:11:17.306 --> 01:11:17.806
THEN IT IS VERY ENCOURAGING

01:11:17.873 --> 01:11:20.042
THAT THE- FOR YOU SEE CONTINUE

01:11:20.109 --> 01:11:22.378

01:11:39.561 --> 01:11:42.097
TOOK A COVERED BREAK. JUVENTUS

01:11:42.164 --> 01:11:43.565
A PATE THAT THEY WOULD COME

01:11:43.632 --> 01:11:46.301
BACK ON OR THEY TRY TO GET THAT

01:11:46.368 --> 01:11:47.670
DEGREE ELSEWHERE PROBABLY MAKES

01:11:47.736 --> 01:11:48.704
SENSE THAT IT WOULD FINISHED OR

01:11:48.771 --> 01:11:50.673

01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:05.714
JUST GETTING THE WORD OUT WORD

01:13:05.781 --> 01:13:08.083

ACTUALLY HAPPENING YEAH THAT'S

01:13:26.435 --> 01:13:27.369
THE THAT'S THE MESSAGING

01:13:27.436 --> 01:13:28.504
POINTED AT THE OTHER POINT OF

01:13:28.570 --> 01:13:29.938
IT TOO IS OF COURSE THE FUNDING

01:13:30.005 --> 01:13:31.807
OF THE GRADUATION OF ITSELF. IT

01:13:31.874 --> 01:13:33.475
HAD BEEN ADDED HATS THREE SOLID

01:13:33.542 --> 01:13:34.910
YEARS OF REALLY SOLID FUNDING

01:13:34.977 --> 01:13:36.311
FOR THAT FOR THE GRADUATION OF.

01:13:36.378 --> 01:13:37.646
WHAT THAT ALLOWED FOR IS THE

01:13:37.713 --> 01:13:39.348
CAMPUS IS TO MATCH THAT DEMAND

01:13:39.414 --> 01:13:40.482
FROM STUDENTS AT ALLOWED

01:13:40.549 --> 01:13:41.750
CAMPUSES TO OFFER THOSE

01:13:41.817 --> 01:13:43.452
ADDITIONAL COURSES SO THAT.

01:13:43.519 --> 01:13:46.255
STUDENTS COULD TAKE THOSE UP TO

01:13:46.321 --> 01:13:49.391
FIFTEEN UNITS. WORTH OF COURSE

01:13:49.458 --> 01:13:50.759
IS NOT A GRADUATE AS AS THEY

01:13:50.826 --> 01:13:52.928
SEE FIT COURSE THAT I GRABBED

01:13:52.995 --> 01:13:54.863
IT SHOULD NEVER HAVE SAID THAT

01:13:54.930 --> 01:13:56.932
YOU MUST TAKE IT AWFUL LOAD. UP

01:13:56.999 --> 01:13:58.300
OF COURSE EVERY STUDENT HAS

01:13:58.367 --> 01:14:00.002
THEIR OWN UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES

01:14:00.068 --> 01:14:01.236
AND CAN GO AT A SLOWER PACE OF

01:14:01.303 --> 01:14:03.205
THE CHU SO BUT- THE GOAL OF THE

01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:04.873
GRADUATION OF WAS TO OFFER THAT

01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:06.275
IS AS TO THE EXTENT WE COULD

01:14:06.341 --> 01:14:08.110
POSSIBLE TO OVER STUDENTS. I

01:14:08.177 --> 01:14:12.080
THINK- I. THINK WE'RE SHOWING A

01:14:12.147 --> 01:14:12.681
LOT OF GREAT SUCCESS SO FAR.

01:14:12.748 --> 01:14:13.515
YEAH WELL I OBVIOUSLY I THINK

01:14:13.582 --> 01:14:17.452
THAT IS A VERY- IMPORTANT NEWS

01:14:17.519 --> 01:14:19.388
AND IT. IT IS A TWO FOLD HELP

01:14:19.454 --> 01:14:20.255
THAT HELPS THE STUDENTS

01:14:20.322 --> 01:14:22.491
GRADUATE. WITHIN FOUR YEARS

01:14:22.558 --> 01:14:24.726
WITHOUT AS MUCH DEBT- WE KNOW

01:14:24.793 --> 01:14:26.695
THAT'S THE STUDENTS GO ON FOR

01:14:26.762 --> 01:14:28.130
FIVE OR SIX YEARS THEY- RUN OUT

01:14:28.197 --> 01:14:29.998
OF. CAL GRANT ELIGIBILITY THEY

01:14:30.065 --> 01:14:31.700
HAVE TO BORROW MONEY. JUST

01:14:31.767 --> 01:14:33.035
SOMETHING OUT SAID THIS IS

01:14:33.101 --> 01:14:35.470
CYCLE. AND THEN FURTHER. YOU

01:14:35.537 --> 01:14:37.339

01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:26.054
WE STILL HAVE PLENTY OF

01:20:26.121 --> 01:20:28.723
CAPACITY FOR A QUARANTINING OUR

01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:34.663
STUDENTS WHO ARE- WHO. ARE ARE

01:20:34.729 --> 01:20:35.697
ARE COULD BE POSITIVE. I THINK

01:20:35.764 --> 01:20:36.932
THE ABOUT YOUR- TRACING

01:20:36.998 --> 01:20:39.467
PARTICLE. OUR I GET IT'S

01:20:39.534 --> 01:20:41.036
DIFFERENT FOR EACH CAMPUS BUT-

01:20:41.102 --> 01:20:44.239
UC SAN DIEGO IS PROBABLY THE-

01:20:44.306 --> 01:20:45.874
PROBABLY THE BUT THE MOST

01:20:45.941 --> 01:20:48.476
ROBUST WITH THAT AND THEY- ARE

01:20:48.543 --> 01:20:49.211
THEY HAVE BEEN INCORPORATING

01:20:49.277 --> 01:20:50.145
THAT THE OTHER THING THAT SAN

01:20:50.212 --> 01:20:51.780
DIEGO IS DONE IS THEY'RE ALSO

01:20:51.846 --> 01:20:52.647

THEY FOUNDED THEIR TEST THE

01:20:56.017 --> 01:20:58.420
POSITIVE THE RATES ARE HIGHER-

01:20:58.486 --> 01:20:59.621
SOMETIMES AS MUCH AS THREE

01:20:59.688 --> 01:21:01.456
TIMES HIGHER SO STUDENTS ON ON

01:21:01.523 --> 01:21:03.425

01:21:03.491 --> 01:21:04.793
FINDING IS THAT IT'S ALMOST

01:21:04.859 --> 01:21:07.395

WHERE WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO

01:27:19.334 --> 01:27:21.202
TAKE ALL OF OUR REVENUE SOURCES

01:27:21.269 --> 01:27:22.737
ESPECIALLY A COVERT ON. TALK

01:27:22.804 --> 01:27:24.505
ABOUT THE COVERT SEASON HERE WE

01:27:24.572 --> 01:27:25.607
DON'T HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY

01:27:25.673 --> 01:27:27.342
THEN BE ABLE TO UTILIZE ALL OF

01:27:27.408 --> 01:27:29.010
OUR REVENUE SOURCES IN ORDER TO

01:27:29.077 --> 01:27:31.045
MITIGATE. POTENTIAL LAYOFFS TO

01:27:31.112 --> 01:27:33.147
MITIGATE COST IMPLICATE. ANY

01:27:33.214 --> 01:27:34.349
DEFICITS THAT WE MIGHT HAVE IN

01:27:34.415 --> 01:27:35.483
A PARTICULAR PROGRAM ON A

01:27:35.550 --> 01:27:37.585
PARTICULAR CAMPUS SO. SO ONE

01:27:37.652 --> 01:27:38.620
THING THAT WE THINK WOULD BE

01:27:38.686 --> 01:27:39.887
VERY HELPFUL IS TO PROVIDE THE

01:27:39.954 --> 01:27:41.522
OPPORTUNITY. THROUGH A

01:27:41.589 --> 01:27:43.625
STATUTORY CHANGE TO CHANGE THAT

01:27:43.691 --> 01:27:45.526
TO A TRANSFER OF. FUNDS

01:27:45.593 --> 01:27:48.029
BETWEEN- TRANSFER OF MONEY

01:27:48.096 --> 01:27:50.131
BETWEEN FUNDS. OTHER STRAIGHT

01:27:50.198 --> 01:27:53.067
AFTER THAT OF COURSE- BUT-

01:27:53.134 --> 01:27:54.402
THAT'S THAT'S ONE THAT WAY WE

01:27:54.469 --> 01:27:55.303
COULD HAVE LOOKS BUT THE OTHER

01:27:55.370 --> 01:27:56.404
THING THAT WE DON'T HAVE A

01:27:56.471 --> 01:27:58.206
FORTY- AT THE MOMENT LIKE.

01:27:58.272 --> 01:27:59.641
UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA DOESN'T

01:27:59.707 --> 01:28:01.943
EVEN THE STATE HOUSE. WHERE YOU

01:28:02.010 --> 01:28:03.177
COULD- YOU COULD BORROW FOR

01:28:03.244 --> 01:28:05.279
LIQUIDITY PURPOSES RIGHT NOW.

01:28:05.346 --> 01:28:06.914
OUR ONLY AVENUE RIGHT NOW IS

01:28:06.981 --> 01:28:12.587
TOO LOW BETWEEN FUND SOURCES.

01:28:12.654 --> 01:28:13.221
OR TO UTILIZE THE RESERVES THAT

01:28:13.287 --> 01:28:13.888
WE HAVE. THANK YOU AND I'M SURE

01:28:13.955 --> 01:28:14.822
THEY'LL BE PART OF THE

01:28:14.889 --> 01:28:16.257
CONVERSATIONS GOING FORWARD.

01:28:16.324 --> 01:28:17.759
THE POSITIVES AND THE NEGATIVES

01:28:17.825 --> 01:28:19.894
OF THAT THAT THAT FLEXIBILITY-

01:28:19.961 --> 01:28:21.462
JUST ONE OTHER QUESTION WITH

01:28:21.529 --> 01:28:22.096
REGARD TO NEXT YEAR'S FRESHMAN

01:28:22.163 --> 01:28:23.998
CLASS. SO I THINK I'VE READ

01:28:24.065 --> 01:28:25.633
LATELY THAT THIS ISSUE IS-

01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:27.068
EDUCATING MORE STUDENTS THAN

01:28:27.135 --> 01:28:28.569
EVER HAS. SO THAT'S A GOOD

01:28:28.636 --> 01:28:29.937
THING. BUT WHAT WOULD NEXT

01:28:30.004 --> 01:28:32.140
YEAR'S FRESHMAN CLASS LOOK LIKE

01:28:32.206 --> 01:28:35.043
MY TO BE LARGER. SMALLER

01:28:35.109 --> 01:28:35.777
BECAUSE SOME STUDENTS MIGHT

01:28:35.843 --> 01:28:39.647
HELD OFF. A YEAR MAYBE YOU

01:28:39.714 --> 01:28:40.248
MIGHT KNOW NUMBERS ASSOCIATED

01:28:40.314 --> 01:28:40.948
THAT MAYBE NOT. DO DO DO YOU

01:28:41.015 --> 01:28:43.351
HAVE ANY. YOU HAVE ANY

01:28:43.418 --> 01:28:45.053
PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT NEXT YEAR'S

01:28:45.119 --> 01:28:47.488
FRESHMAN CLASS MY LOOK ON. YES

01:28:47.555 --> 01:28:49.123
SIR THAT'S THAT'S THE THAT THE

01:28:49.190 --> 01:28:52.593
BIG CRYSTAL BALL QUESTION.

01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:55.596
GENERALLY SPEAKING UP FROM OUR

01:28:55.663 --> 01:28:57.465
ROLE WITH EXPERIENCE RIGHT NOW

01:28:57.532 --> 01:28:59.767
WHICH IS FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY

01:28:59.834 --> 01:29:01.869
WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN OUR

01:29:01.936 --> 01:29:05.273
TRANSFER STUDENTS THAT BEARS

01:29:05.339 --> 01:29:06.941
ALMOST TO THE DOCK TO THE

01:29:07.008 --> 01:29:09.544
NUMBER. A SLIGHT DECREASE IN

01:29:09.610 --> 01:29:12.046
OUR FIRST TIME FRESHMEN. AND

01:29:12.113 --> 01:29:13.181
THERE COULD BE A WHOLE HOST OF

01:29:13.247 --> 01:29:15.049
REASONS WHY THAT'S THE CASE BUT

01:29:15.116 --> 01:29:16.217
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:29:16.284 --> 01:29:18.653
HAS ALLOWED US T MAINTAIN OUR

01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:21.022
ROLE THAT HAS HAS BEEN THE FACT

01:29:21.089 --> 01:29:22.523
THAT WE KNOW WE ANNOUNCED

01:29:22.590 --> 01:29:23.591
EARLIER INTENTIONS OF GOING

01:29:23.658 --> 01:29:25.326
VIRTUAL. JUST BEING ABLE TO

01:29:25.393 --> 01:29:27.562
ALLOW FAMILIES THAT OPPORTUNITY

01:29:27.628 --> 01:29:30.531
TO PLAN FOR IT. SO IF ARE WHAT

01:29:30.598 --> 01:29:32.333
WE THINK IS OUR SUCCESS IN IN

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:33.601
DECIDING WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO

01:29:33.668 --> 01:29:35.436
BE FOR A SHORT PERSON. I THINK

01:29:35.503 --> 01:29:37.338
THAT WILL HELP INFORM US

01:29:37.405 --> 01:29:38.473
WHETHER FRESHMAN ENTER THE

01:29:38.539 --> 01:29:40.241
UNIVERSITY OR OR HAVE IT-

01:29:40.308 --> 01:29:41.609
THERE'S A DEMAND FOR FRESHMEN

01:29:41.676 --> 01:29:43.411
TO ENTER THE UNIVERSITY IN THE

01:29:43.478 --> 01:29:45.613
FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. BUT

01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:47.115
IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A WAYS OUT

01:29:47.181 --> 01:29:48.883
THERE IS JUST AN OUT THERE I

01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:50.918
WOULD THINK THOUGH THAT IF THE

01:29:50.985 --> 01:29:53.921
ECONOMY PROCESS AS IT IS- AND

01:29:53.988 --> 01:29:55.656
IF IT PERSISTS AS IT IS IT

01:29:55.723 --> 01:29:56.991
MIGHT BE MORE DIFFICULT FOR

01:29:57.058 --> 01:29:57.992
YOUNG PEOPLE COMING OUT OF HIGH

01:29:58.059 --> 01:29:59.527
SCHOOL TO. GAIN EMPLOYMENT THAT

01:29:59.594 --> 01:30:01.462
DO OTHER THINGS SO THERE MAY BE

01:30:01.529 --> 01:30:03.564
GREATER DEMAND TO CONTINUE TO

01:30:03.631 --> 01:30:05.967
PURSUE HIGHER EDUCATION- BUT

01:30:06.033 --> 01:30:08.102
IT'S RIGHT NOW IT'S DIFFICULT

01:30:08.169 --> 01:30:09.604
TO FOR SEE WHAT THE ANSWER IS

01:30:09.670 --> 01:30:13.141
ON THAT INVOLVED TWENTY ONE.

01:30:13.207 --> 01:30:13.708
WHAT WHAT IS THE UNIVERSITY

01:30:13.775 --> 01:30:15.576
PROJECTING. ALL RIGHT NOW WE

01:30:15.643 --> 01:30:17.145
DON'T HAVE ANY PROJECTIONS THAT

01:30:17.211 --> 01:30:18.746
I THAT I'M AWARE OF FOR NEXT

01:30:18.813 --> 01:30:20.982
YOU PROBABLY WON'T HAVE

01:30:21.048 --> 01:30:21.616
LOCATIONS OR DO I ASSUME AT THE

01:30:21.682 --> 01:30:25.586
END OF THIS MONTH. THEY WOULD

01:30:25.653 --> 01:30:27.455
BE OUR DATABASE. YET THE END OF

01:30:27.522 --> 01:30:29.423
THIS MONTH FOR OUR CAMPUS BUT

01:30:42.236 --> 01:30:43.805
NOVEMBER IS THAT BEEN ALTERED

01:30:43.871 --> 01:30:45.873
PUSH BACK AT ALL OR- IT REALLY

01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:47.909
DEPENDS ON THE CAMPUS- BUT- FOR

01:30:47.975 --> 01:30:50.244
THE MOST PART. WE CAN HAVE A

01:30:50.311 --> 01:30:52.113

DEPENDING ON DEMAND A

01:30:54.649 --> 01:30:56.551
PARTICULAR CAMPUSES. IT COULD

01:30:56.617 --> 01:30:58.252

01:31:10.865 --> 01:31:12.433
ON THE GENERAL ANSWERS IS OKAY

01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:13.868

HAVE. WELL LET ME AT LEAST LET

01:34:02.236 --> 01:34:04.338
ME LET ME MAKE TWO TO TWO

01:34:04.405 --> 01:34:06.307
GROUPS OF EMPLOYEES SO. THE

01:34:06.374 --> 01:34:07.975
FIRST OF A PLOY IS WITH US IN

01:34:08.042 --> 01:34:10.011
OUR NON CORE AREAS TOO. SO

01:34:10.077 --> 01:34:11.612
THOSE ARE LIKE BOOKSTORES AND

01:34:11.679 --> 01:34:13.581
THINGS LIKE THAT- WHEN THERE

01:34:13.647 --> 01:34:15.950
WAS NO- NO NO FOOD SERVICE OR

01:34:16.017 --> 01:34:18.019
THE BOOKSTORES WERE CLOSE THOSE

01:34:18.085 --> 01:34:21.722
ENTERPRISES- HAD TO HAD TO LEAD

01:34:21.789 --> 01:34:23.758
A NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES GO MOSTLY

01:34:23.824 --> 01:34:25.159
STUDENT WORKERS FOR THE MOST

01:34:25.226 --> 01:34:26.994
PART THERE- AND I WAS JUST

01:34:27.061 --> 01:34:28.162
BECAUSE THERE IS NO REVENUE

01:34:28.229 --> 01:34:29.563
COMING IN AND THERE WAS NOBODY

01:34:29.630 --> 01:34:30.898
THAT WAS THAT WAS. TAKING

01:34:30.965 --> 01:34:32.233
ADVANTAGE OF BEING ON CAMPUS

01:34:32.299 --> 01:34:33.200
BECAUSE THE CAMPUSES WERE

01:34:33.267 --> 01:34:34.735
CLOSED WHEN IT COMES TO THE

01:34:34.802 --> 01:34:35.669
REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES WE

01:34:35.736 --> 01:34:37.038

THROUGH THE END OF THE FISCAL

01:34:41.342 --> 01:34:42.676
YEAR SO JUNE THIRTY AT THAT

01:34:42.743 --> 01:34:44.445
THAT EXTENDED BECAUSE OF THAT

01:34:44.512 --> 01:34:46.580
THE FEDERAL CARES ACT. OF CARE

01:34:46.647 --> 01:34:48.616
SO WE HAVE WE HAVE THOSE WHAT

01:34:48.682 --> 01:34:50.418
IS BOILING DOWN TO NOW IN TERMS

01:34:50.484 --> 01:34:52.386
OF OUR THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY

01:34:52.453 --> 01:34:54.121
FOUR ORIGINAL LAYOFF NOTICES.

01:34:54.188 --> 01:34:55.890
IS THAT WE HAVE EITHER A LACK

01:34:55.956 --> 01:34:57.758
OF WORK OR WE HAVE A LACK OF

01:34:57.825 --> 01:35:00.294
FUNDS RELATED TO THESE. SO FOR

01:35:00.361 --> 01:35:01.929
IT LIKE I SAID IN MY TESTIMONY

01:35:01.996 --> 01:35:02.563
AT THE EXAMPLE WAS SENT ON THE

01:35:02.630 --> 01:35:05.299
STATE. THOSE WERE STATE

01:35:05.366 --> 01:35:07.168
EMPLOYEES THAT WORKED IN DINING

01:35:07.234 --> 01:35:10.638
SERVICES AND THERE WAS. NO

01:35:10.704 --> 01:35:12.740
DINING SERVICES BEING PROVIDED

01:35:12.807 --> 01:35:13.374
ON CAMPUS THE CAMPUS WAS

01:35:13.441 --> 01:35:15.209
LARGELY SHUTTERED. AND SO WE

01:35:15.276 --> 01:35:16.577
THEN HAD TO BECAUSE THERE'S A

01:35:16.644 --> 01:35:18.212
LACK OF WORK AND A LACK OF

01:35:18.279 --> 01:35:20.081
FUNDS RELATED TO IT WE HAD TO

01:35:20.147 --> 01:35:22.049
THEN LATE NOTICE THOSE FOLKS.

01:35:22.116 --> 01:35:23.451
BUT LIKE I ALSO SAID IN MY

01:35:23.517 --> 01:35:25.019
TESTIMONY IS THAT WE'VE BEEN

01:35:25.086 --> 01:35:26.720
WORKING AND MEETING CONFERRING

01:35:26.787 --> 01:35:28.322
WITH THESE UNITS TO REALLY TRY

01:35:28.389 --> 01:35:30.491
TO FIND GOOD PLACES FOR A PLACE

01:35:30.558 --> 01:35:31.692
THAT WERE THERE MAY BE A

01:35:31.759 --> 01:35:33.494
CLASSIFICATION OR TWO THAT MAY

01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:34.095
BE ABLE TO GO FROM BACK AND

01:35:34.161 --> 01:35:37.064
FORTH- IN THE CASE OF CINEMA.

01:35:37.131 --> 01:35:38.566
OF THOSE WITH SERVICE A NUMBER

01:35:38.632 --> 01:35:39.934
OF THOSE WHO SERVICE EMPLOYEES

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.535
WERE CONVERTED OVER TEXT AUDIO

01:35:41.602 --> 01:35:44.004
OR THEY WERE ABLE TO BE RE

01:35:44.071 --> 01:35:46.006
HIRED ON A TEMPORARY BASIS SORT

01:35:46.073 --> 01:35:47.241
DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN IN

01:35:47.308 --> 01:35:48.776
ORDER FOR THAT TO HAPPEN. BUT

01:35:48.843 --> 01:35:50.177
AT SOME POINT IT DOES HAVE TO

01:35:50.244 --> 01:35:52.379
GIVE WHERE YOU YOU DO RUN OUT

01:35:52.446 --> 01:35:54.415
OF FUNDS IT'S VERY UNFORTUNATE

01:35:54.482 --> 01:35:55.816
WE HAVE WE WOULD HAVE TO

01:35:55.883 --> 01:35:57.051
CONTINUE WITH SOME OF THESE

01:35:57.118 --> 01:36:02.623
LAYOFFS. BUT THEY'RE. THERE

01:36:02.690 --> 01:36:03.157
THAT IS A KIND OF A FOR I

01:36:03.224 --> 01:36:04.492
RESORT AND TERMS OF. IF WE

01:36:04.558 --> 01:36:06.093
CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY AND BECAUSE

01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:07.995
THAT SERVICES NO LONGER BEING

01:36:08.062 --> 01:36:09.430
PROVIDED DURING THE PANDEMIC

01:36:09.497 --> 01:36:11.298
THEM THAT'S TO BE THE CASE

01:36:11.365 --> 01:36:12.800
NOBODY COMES TO THEM HAVING THE

01:36:12.867 --> 01:36:14.001
OPPORTUNITY TO BE REHIRED WITH

01:36:14.068 --> 01:36:15.136
THINGS CHANGE WITH THE

01:36:15.202 --> 01:36:17.271
POTENTIAL PANDEMIC LEAVES WE

01:36:17.338 --> 01:36:18.806
HAVE A VERY LONG PERIOD OF TIME

01:36:18.873 --> 01:36:20.307
WHERE EMPLOYEES CAN HAVE

01:36:20.374 --> 01:36:21.842
ANYWHERE BETWEEN THREE AND FIVE

01:36:21.909 --> 01:36:23.744
YEARS TO. FIRST FIRST RIGHT OF

01:36:23.811 --> 01:36:25.546
RETURN BACK TO WORK SO THAT'S

01:36:25.613 --> 01:36:27.648
THAT'S ANOTHER ADDED BENEFIT SO

01:36:27.715 --> 01:36:29.183
IT'S UNFORTUNATE WE'RE AT THIS

01:36:29.250 --> 01:36:31.685
POINT IN SOME INSTANCES- BUT

01:36:31.752 --> 01:36:34.121
IT'S A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF THE

01:36:34.188 --> 01:36:36.590
FOLKS SYSTEM WIDE. AS LONG AS

01:36:36.657 --> 01:36:39.660
THINGS DON'T CONTINUE TO SPIRAL

01:36:39.727 --> 01:36:41.328
DOWN IN TERMS OF THE PANDEMIC

01:36:41.395 --> 01:36:43.130
AND STATE FUNDING WE HOPE THAT

01:36:43.197 --> 01:36:44.999
WE CAN MITIGATE THIS EVEN

01:36:45.065 --> 01:36:46.200
FURTHER WITH HIRING FREEZES AND

01:36:46.267 --> 01:36:47.768
THOSE SORTS OF THINGS BUT IF

01:36:47.835 --> 01:36:49.403
THINGS GET WORSE- I CAN'T

01:36:49.470 --> 01:36:52.706
PROMISE TO YOU THAT THERE WILL

01:36:52.773 --> 01:36:53.207
NOT BE ADDITIONAL LAYOFF

01:36:53.274 --> 01:36:53.974
NOTICES IN THE FUTURE. THANK

01:36:54.041 --> 01:36:58.512
YOU. THANK YOU MISTER AMBER.

01:36:58.579 --> 01:37:00.681
THANK YOU AND- MY QUESTION IS

CAN BE FOR YOU MISTER STORM IF

01:37:02.516 --> 01:37:05.119
I CAN- FIRST I WANT TO ACTUALLY

01:37:05.186 --> 01:37:07.054
HIGHLIGHT ENROLLMENT IT APPEARS

01:37:07.121 --> 01:37:08.355
THAT NATIONALLY WE'VE HAD

01:37:08.422 --> 01:37:09.723
ENROLLMENT DECREASED

01:37:09.790 --> 01:37:12.426
APPROXIMATELY 4% AND YES THERE

01:37:12.493 --> 01:37:14.361
ARE THREE CAMPUSES IN THE CSU

01:37:14.428 --> 01:37:16.697
SYSTEM THAT ARE SHOWING ALL

01:37:16.764 --> 01:37:19.433
TIME RECORD HIGH ENROLLMENTS

01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:21.302
WHETHER IT'S SACRAMENTO STATE.

01:37:21.368 --> 01:37:24.471
FRESNO STATE OR CSU BAKERSFIELD

01:37:24.538 --> 01:37:26.574
AND WOULD LIKE AND HOPE YOU

01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:29.677
COULD OR YOU MAY PUNCH TO-

01:37:29.743 --> 01:37:31.011
ROBERT NELSON WHO'S COMING

01:37:31.078 --> 01:37:32.746
LATER TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE

01:37:32.813 --> 01:37:34.682
BEST PRACTICES THAT THOSE

01:37:34.748 --> 01:37:36.584
INSTITUTIONS ARE DOING TO

01:37:36.650 --> 01:37:39.053
ENCOURAGE ENROLLMENT TENDS TO

01:37:39.119 --> 01:37:41.222
MAKE SURE WE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES

01:37:41.288 --> 01:37:43.724
IN OUR COMMUNITIES. WELL YOU

01:37:43.791 --> 01:37:45.359
KNOW I THINK I DON'T KNOW ALL

01:37:45.426 --> 01:37:47.294
THE REASONS WHY OUR ROLE THAT

01:37:47.361 --> 01:37:49.430
IS TAKING OFF IN THOSE

01:37:49.496 --> 01:37:52.132
PARTICULAR AREAS. I WILL SAY

01:37:52.199 --> 01:37:53.767
THOUGH THAT WITH THE CENTRAL

01:37:53.834 --> 01:37:57.304
pTALKING ABOUT A CENTRAL VALLEY

01:37:57.371 --> 01:38:01.575
CAMPUSES RIGHT. YOU JUST SEALED-BY A LARGER GROWTH IN IN THE

01:38:01.642 --> 01:38:03.143
POPULATION- GOING THAT

01:38:03.210 --> 01:38:05.546
DIRECTION- YOU ALSO HAVE I

01:38:05.613 --> 01:38:07.715
THINK THE INSTANCE OF FOR NOW

01:38:07.781 --> 01:38:09.250
THIRTY YEARS YOU HAVE IT BEING

01:38:09.316 --> 01:38:10.918
BEATEN TO EVERY CHILD'S HEAD IN

01:38:10.985 --> 01:38:13.354
SCHOOL. THAT YOU SHOULD GO ON

01:38:13.420 --> 01:38:15.055
TO TRY TO BE A FOUR YOU'RE A

01:38:15.122 --> 01:38:17.091
COLLEGE STUDENT RIGHT IT'S SO

01:38:17.157 --> 01:38:18.325
YOU HAVE A EXCEEDING NUMBER OF

01:38:18.392 --> 01:38:19.860
FOLKS THAT ARE WANTING HER OF

01:38:19.927 --> 01:38:21.295
YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE WANTING

01:38:21.362 --> 01:38:23.030
TO GO TO SCHOOL. AND GO TO

01:38:23.097 --> 01:38:25.099
HIGHER AT REPUBLIC THE OTHER

01:38:25.165 --> 01:38:27.268
FACTOR IS OF COURSE- DATE THERE

01:38:27.334 --> 01:38:30.971
ARE ARE ARE. NO OPTIONS FOR

01:38:31.038 --> 01:38:31.939
LESS OPTIONS FOR EMPLOYMENT

01:38:32.006 --> 01:38:34.241
THEN. I SAY THEY WERE IN THE

01:38:34.308 --> 01:38:36.644
RECENT PAST- BUT I THINK YOU

01:38:36.710 --> 01:38:37.645
SEE THAT BECAUSE OF THE

01:38:37.711 --> 01:38:39.046
DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFT YOU SEE THAT

01:38:39.113 --> 01:38:41.048
THERE IS A HUGE DEMAND GROWING

01:38:41.115 --> 01:38:42.750
AT THE CENTRAL VALLEY THERE.

01:38:42.816 --> 01:38:43.851
AND I THINK THAT'S A VERY GOOD

01:38:43.917 --> 01:38:46.153
THING- BECAUSE- HISTORICALLY

01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:48.255
THE CENTRAL VALLEY AS AS NOT

01:38:48.322 --> 01:38:54.194
HAD. EXCEEDINGLY HIGH RATES OF.

01:38:54.261 --> 01:38:55.963
HIGHER ED. I PARTICIPATION IT

01:38:56.030 --> 01:38:58.132
GRADUATION TENS OF TETRA. BUT

01:38:58.198 --> 01:38:59.800
MAYBE MAYBE A PRESIDENT NELSON

01:38:59.867 --> 01:39:01.201
COULD SHUT A LITTLE BIT BETTER

01:39:01.268 --> 01:39:02.569
LIGHT ON IT FOR FROM THE

01:39:02.636 --> 01:39:04.405
SIXTIES PERSPECTIVE. I MAY BE

01:39:04.471 --> 01:39:06.440
BIASED BUT AS A CENTRAL VALLEY

01:39:06.507 --> 01:39:09.109
NATIVE I THINK OPPORTUNITIES

01:39:09.176 --> 01:39:10.878
FOR MANY IN MY COMMUNITY ALLOW

01:39:10.944 --> 01:39:12.646
US TO ALSO GET BACK TO THIS

01:39:12.713 --> 01:39:14.648
GREAT STATE SO. I'M QUITE

01:39:14.715 --> 01:39:16.016
APPRECIATIVE OF THE INVESTMENTS

01:39:16.083 --> 01:39:18.052
THAT HAVE BEEN MADE INTO BOTH

01:39:18.118 --> 01:39:19.520
THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND SO MANY

01:39:19.586 --> 01:39:20.220
OF OUR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

01:39:20.287 --> 01:39:22.289
DISTURBING. MY NEXT QUESTION

01:39:22.356 --> 01:39:23.123
FOR YOU MISTER STORM THOUGH IF

01:39:23.190 --> 01:39:25.826
I COULD- I'VE HEARD QUITE A BIT

01:39:25.893 --> 01:39:28.162
ABOUT FLEXIBILITY AND- ONE OF

01:39:28.228 --> 01:39:29.363
THE FLEXIBILITIES WE DID WITHIN

01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:31.332
THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT

01:39:31.398 --> 01:39:33.167
WAS LOOKING OUT READ THE

01:39:33.233 --> 01:39:36.036
ABILITY TO RE DIRECT ON SPENT-

01:39:36.103 --> 01:39:37.938
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDS AND

01:39:38.005 --> 01:39:39.707
WANTED TO ASK YOU IF THAT WAS

01:39:39.773 --> 01:39:42.376
SOMETHING YOU HAVE. A BEGUN TO

01:39:42.443 --> 01:39:44.345
DO TO MEET TO HELP TO COVER THE

01:39:44.411 --> 01:39:47.214
INSTRUCTION AS WELL AS THE-

01:39:47.281 --> 01:39:49.116
OTHER OPERATING COSTS. WELL I

01:39:49.183 --> 01:39:50.484
THINK IN THE SHORT ANSWER IS AT

01:39:50.551 --> 01:39:53.620
THIS POINT WE ARE. NOT FLEXING

01:39:53.687 --> 01:39:55.889
THAT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE MONEY

01:39:55.956 --> 01:39:57.691
TO BE USED OPERATE- EXPENSES AT

01:39:57.758 --> 01:40:00.194
THIS POINT. IN THE PRIMARY

01:40:00.260 --> 01:40:03.564
REASON FOR THAT. IS THE FACT

01:40:03.630 --> 01:40:06.333
THAT WE DON'T ANTICIPATE THAT

01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:08.435
THERE WILL BE A LOT OF NEW

01:40:08.502 --> 01:40:11.071
STATE FUNDING. OR BOND FUNDING

01:40:11.138 --> 01:40:12.840
FROM GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND

01:40:12.906 --> 01:40:16.677
VOTES TO BE ABLE TO.

01:40:16.744 --> 01:40:19.346
SIGNIFICANTLY ADDRESS OUR MOST

01:40:19.413 --> 01:40:19.947
PRESSING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

01:40:20.013 --> 01:40:24.385
PROJECTS- RIGHT NOW OUR FOR OUR

01:40:24.451 --> 01:40:25.219
ONE OF OUR FIRST APPROACHES IN

01:40:25.285 --> 01:40:28.856
TERMS OF. SATISFIED WITH THE

01:40:28.922 --> 01:40:30.090
FINANCIAL NEEDS OF THE

01:40:30.157 --> 01:40:31.558
OPERATING FUND OUR CORE OUR

01:40:31.625 --> 01:40:33.527
CORE FOR OUR CORPORATE JET IS

01:40:33.594 --> 01:40:35.996
USING OUR RESERVES AS DIRECTED

01:40:36.063 --> 01:40:37.965
WITHIN THE BUDGET ACT. AND THEN

01:40:38.031 --> 01:40:39.400
ALSO USING SOME OF THESE OTHER

01:40:39.466 --> 01:40:40.734
TOOLS THAT I'VE MENTIONED

01:40:40.801 --> 01:40:43.504
BEFORE ABOUT HIRING FREEZES.

01:40:43.570 --> 01:40:45.272
AND REDUCING TRAVEL THAT SORT

01:40:45.339 --> 01:40:47.074
OF THING WE REALLY WANT TO TRY

01:40:47.141 --> 01:40:48.642
TO PROTECT THE USE OF THAT-

01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:49.443
THAT REMAINING DEFERRED

01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:51.412
MAINTENANCE ONE WE HAD A LOT OF

01:40:51.478 --> 01:40:52.880
A LOT OF CAMPUSES THAT WERE ON

01:40:52.946 --> 01:40:54.948
THE BRINK AND ARE STILL MOVING

01:40:55.015 --> 01:40:55.883
IN THAT DIRECTION TOWARDS

01:40:55.949 --> 01:40:57.184
FIXING SOME OF THE ROCK MORE

01:40:57.251 --> 01:40:59.553
PRESSING NEEDS. AND WITH THE

WITH US IN A IN A DOWNWARD

01:41:10.130 --> 01:41:12.032
ECONOMIC CYCLE RIGHT NOW. WE

01:41:13.567 --> 01:41:16.570
LET'S HOLD THAT FLEXIBILITY AT

01:41:16.637 --> 01:41:18.472

YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THOSE

01:41:22.109 --> 01:41:23.844
THINGS FAIL YOU AND IT'S

01:41:23.911 --> 01:41:25.612
PROBABLY BEST TO ADDRESS THEM

01:41:25.679 --> 01:41:27.514
NOW THE WAIT UNTIL THE END.

01:41:27.581 --> 01:41:28.782
WHEN YOU HAVE NO MONEY

01:41:28.849 --> 01:41:30.551
POTENTIALLY IN YOUR IN THE IN

01:41:30.617 --> 01:41:31.919
THE IN THE DEPTHS OF HAVING A

01:41:31.985 --> 01:41:33.420
REALLY TOUGH BUDGETARY TIME AS

01:41:33.487 --> 01:41:35.155

THINGS DO PERSISTENT GET WORSE

01:41:50.504 --> 01:41:51.939
I THINK THAT YOU MAY SEE A

01:41:52.005 --> 01:41:53.407
CHANGE POTENTIALLY BUT AT THIS

01:41:53.474 --> 01:41:55.209

YEARS WE HAVE EXTENDED THAT ARE

01:44:40.841 --> 01:44:41.808
SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OF

JUST ADOPTED A SYSTEM WIDE. AIR

01:45:08.368 --> 01:45:10.470

THAT WE CAN MAKE UNIFORMS

01:45:11.905 --> 01:45:14.608
VISIONS ON WHEN I CAMPUS IS-

ACTIVITY- I TAKES PLACE BUT- I

01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:21.848
THINK THE VERY GOOD WE'VE NOT

01:45:21.915 --> 01:45:23.483

SO WE HAVE NOT SEEN DECLINES-

01:45:31.491 --> 01:45:33.627
BASED ON THIS BUT I DO THINK WE

01:45:33.694 --> 01:45:35.095

THERE'S AND THIS APPLIES TO

01:46:10.297 --> 01:46:11.765
CHICO AS WELL IS THAT THOSE

CAMPUSES DRAW A SIGNIFICANT

01:46:14.067 --> 01:46:16.670
NUMBER OF THAT THEIR STUDENTS

THAT- YET THE JUST THAT. THE

01:47:17.998 --> 01:47:19.866
DESIRE TO BE ENROLLED IN THOSE

01:47:28.041 --> 01:47:29.476
BE DOWN HUMBOLDT HAS HAD A

01:47:29.543 --> 01:47:31.278
LONGER STRETCH OF THIS- THEY'VE

01:47:31.344 --> 01:47:33.413
GONE BACK SEVERAL- ACADEMIC

01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:34.114
YEARS WHERE THEIR ENROLLMENT

01:47:34.181 --> 01:47:36.383
HAS BEEN SOFT. SO NUMBERS ONLY

01:47:36.449 --> 01:47:38.418
BEEN EXPERIENCING THAT LATELY

01:47:38.485 --> 01:47:40.020
BUT INTERNET BUT BUT ACT THE

01:47:40.086 --> 01:47:41.655
RIVER QUESTION OF WHETHER THOSE

01:47:41.721 --> 01:47:42.689
STUDENTS LOCALLY ARE BEING

01:47:42.756 --> 01:47:44.591

01:47:46.493 --> 01:47:48.094
QUESTION IS GETTING THROUGH ALL

PRESSURES WHETHER THEY'RE ABLE

01:47:53.433 --> 01:47:54.467
TO ATTEND OR NOT THAT'S THAT'S

01:47:54.534 --> 01:47:59.573
REALLY DRIVEN BY. THE CHOICE OF

TO PASS THEIR EDUCATIONAL PLANS

01:56:11.331 --> 01:56:14.000

AND HAVE LESS PROPERTY WEALTH.

01:59:18.851 --> 01:59:21.521
AND AS A RESULT THEY HAVE A

01:59:21.587 --> 01:59:23.856
**** GREATER SHARE OF A STATE

01:59:23.923 --> 01:59:25.992

AND UNIVERSITIES HAVE CONTINUED

02:07:06.352 --> 02:07:07.686
TO HAVE SOME POPULATION OF

02:07:07.753 --> 02:07:09.655
STUDENTS ON CAMPUS YOU KNOW FOR

02:07:09.722 --> 02:07:10.990

CAMPUS HOUSING- THE COST OF

02:07:15.995 --> 02:07:17.730
TESTING IS SIGNIFICANT. AT

02:07:17.796 --> 02:07:18.831
LEAST IN OUR EXPERIENCE SO FAR

SO ANYTHING THAT STATE CAN DO

02:07:24.236 --> 02:07:26.138
TO HELP BRING THESE COSTS DOWN

02:07:26.205 --> 02:07:27.673
I WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED

SURVEY DATA. INDICATE A MASSIVE

02:07:41.920 --> 02:07:42.788
DISRUPTION WITHIN HIGHER

THE PIPELINE TH THESE WILL

02:07:51.463 --> 02:07:52.631
CONTINUE TO BE FELT FOR THE

02:07:52.698 --> 02:07:54.233

02:08:00.139 --> 02:08:02.474
CONCERNS- REGARDING STATUTORY

02:08:02.541 --> 02:08:04.209

02:08:10.049 --> 02:08:11.650
COLLEGE ATTENDANCE FOR STUDENTS

02:08:11.717 --> 02:08:14.920
REGARDLESS OF THE INSTITUTION-

02:08:14.987 --> 02:08:16.355
PRIVATE NONPROFIT COLLEGES ARE

02:08:16.422 --> 02:08:17.656
ALL OVER THIS STATE IN ANY

THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO

02:08:33.305 --> 02:08:34.773
THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY

02:08:34.840 --> 02:08:36.608
AND HIGHER EDUCATION RIGHT NOW.

02:08:36.675 --> 02:08:38.143

INDEPENDENT COLLEGES. AND

02:09:00.332 --> 02:09:03.235
UNIVERSITIES THAT HAVE- SMALLER

02:09:03.302 --> 02:09:05.270
RESERVES HAVE BEEN GREATLY

02:09:05.337 --> 02:09:08.740
IMPACTED IS THERE ANY DANGER OF

SEEING ANY OF THESE SMALLER

02:09:10.809 --> 02:09:12.911
PRIVATE COLLEGES HAVE ENDED TO

LIGHT AT THE END OF THIS TUNNEL

02:09:24.556 --> 02:09:27.326
IS- CERTAINLY WE HAVE

02:09:27.392 --> 02:09:29.194
INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE VERY-

02:09:29.261 --> 02:09:31.763
SMALL ENDOWMENTS- AND THEREFORE

02:09:31.830 --> 02:09:32.631
YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANTLY LESS

02:09:32.698 --> 02:09:36.068
RESOURCES TO DRAW FROM- AND I

02:09:46.979 --> 02:09:48.881
MEASURES- TO HELP BRIDGE THIS

02:09:48.947 --> 02:09:50.249
DIVIDE BUT CERTAINLY THE

02:09:50.315 --> 02:09:52.184
LONGER- THIS DISRUPTION

02:09:52.251 --> 02:09:54.453
CONTINUES- THE MORE. THEY HAVE

02:09:54.520 --> 02:09:56.088

02:10:07.833 --> 02:10:09.501
BUT IF YOU CAN GIVE US A

02:10:09.568 --> 02:10:11.303
SNAPSHOT IN THE COMMUNITY

02:10:11.370 --> 02:10:14.072
COLLEGE. IN ENROLLMENT-

02:10:14.139 --> 02:10:16.775
DROPPING. HAVE THERE BEEN ANY

02:10:16.842 --> 02:10:17.876
YOU KNOW I KNOW THERE'S A LOT

02:10:17.943 --> 02:10:19.778
OF AN IDENTICAL. STORIES BUT

02:10:19.845 --> 02:10:20.946
THERE BEEN ANY SURVEYS FROM

02:10:21.013 --> 02:10:22.748
YOUR CAMPUSES ON WHAT THAT. THE

02:10:22.814 --> 02:10:24.082
TOP ISSUES ARE BECAUSE YOU KNOW

02:10:24.149 --> 02:10:25.684
USUALLY WHEN YOU HAVE A

02:10:25.751 --> 02:10:28.654
RECESSION. PEOPLE GO BACK TO

02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:30.422
SCHOOL IN THE COMMUNICATIONS

02:10:30.489 --> 02:10:31.023
BUT THIS IS A DIFFERENT TYPE

02:10:31.089 --> 02:10:35.727
OF. PANDEMIC. IN A LOT OF OUR

02:10:35.794 --> 02:10:36.728
WORKERS. YOU KNOW WE'RE DEALING

02:10:36.795 --> 02:10:37.329
WITH A OWN ISSUES WITH THEIR

02:10:37.396 --> 02:10:38.997
OWNFOR. THEY MAY HAVE KIDS AT

02:10:39.064 --> 02:10:40.465
HOME AS WELL AND THEY HAVE TO

02:10:40.532 --> 02:10:41.767
DEAL WITH THEIR ONLINE.

02:10:41.833 --> 02:10:46.505
EDUCATION SO- WHAT TYPE OF. OF

02:10:46.572 --> 02:10:48.740
ANALYSIS DO WE HAVE IF ANY. SIX

02:10:48.807 --> 02:10:51.910
MONTHS LATER. YEAH THANK YOU

02:10:51.977 --> 02:10:54.012
ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY. ONE OF

02:10:54.079 --> 02:10:55.614
THE THINGS I SHARED IS THAT OUR

02:10:55.681 --> 02:10:57.416
STUDENTS HAVE BEEN SOME OF THE

02:10:57.482 --> 02:10:58.684
THAT HAVE BEEN THE MOST

02:10:58.750 --> 02:11:00.886
AFFECTED PERSONALLY BY THESE

02:11:00.953 --> 02:11:02.387
CAN DAMAGE. BECAUSE THEY

02:11:02.454 --> 02:11:05.157
STARTED THIS PANDEMIC. ALREADY

02:11:05.224 --> 02:11:08.327
WITH LOCAL RESOURCES LOW ACCESS

02:11:08.393 --> 02:11:10.295
TO FINANCIAL AID SO DIDN'T HAVE

02:11:10.362 --> 02:11:12.631
THE SAFETY NETS. ANY JOB LOSSES

02:11:12.698 --> 02:11:15.100
CHANGES IN WAGES AFFECT

02:11:15.167 --> 02:11:17.636
IMMEDIATELY. SO WHAT WE SAW IN

02:11:17.703 --> 02:11:21.506
SPRING WAS THAT WE WERE ABLE TO

02:11:21.573 --> 02:11:23.208
GENERALLY MAINTAIN ENROLLMENTS

02:11:23.275 --> 02:11:25.944
THROUGHOUT. THE SPRING SEMESTER

02:11:26.011 --> 02:11:30.749
WHILE WE WERE DOWN- JUST UNDER

02:11:30.816 --> 02:11:33.719
1% FOR A FULL WE DON'T GET OUT

02:11:33.785 --> 02:11:35.621
DAY INTO JAN FIFTEENTH WHAT WE

02:11:35.687 --> 02:11:38.557
DID INSTEAD WAS A SEND A

02:11:38.624 --> 02:11:40.759
STATEWIDE SURVEY IN PARTNERSHIP

02:11:40.826 --> 02:11:42.561
WITH ONE OF OUR ORGANIZATIONS.

02:11:42.628 --> 02:11:44.196
AND BASED ON THAT SAMPLE WE'RE

02:11:44.263 --> 02:11:46.331
SEEING THAT WE ARE DOWN ABOUT

02:11:46.398 --> 02:11:50.702
7% OF N. F. TES. AND SO WHAT

02:11:50.769 --> 02:11:52.571
THAT MEANS IS THAT IN SOME OF

02:11:52.638 --> 02:11:54.172
THE EARLY ANALYSIS WE'RE SEEING

02:11:54.239 --> 02:11:55.707
THAT STUDENTS WITH DEPENDENT

02:11:55.774 --> 02:11:57.676
CHILDREN WERE LIKELY MOST

02:11:57.743 --> 02:12:00.379
AFFECTED AND THAT STUDENTS MAY

02:12:00.445 --> 02:12:01.280
STILL BE ON OUR CAMPUSES BUT

02:12:01.346 --> 02:12:03.582
TAKING FEWER CLASSES. IT'S A

02:12:03.649 --> 02:12:05.217
WHATEVER WE CAN DO TO SUPPORT

02:12:05.284 --> 02:12:07.519
THEM AS INDIVIDUALS IT'S GOING

02:12:07.586 --> 02:12:10.389
TO BE KEY AS WE MOVE FORWARD

02:12:10.455 --> 02:12:12.324
BOTH TO MAINTAIN OUR PIPELINE

02:12:12.391 --> 02:12:14.259
TO AT UC AND CSU OF TRANSFERS

02:12:14.326 --> 02:12:17.162
IN ACC YOU. BUT JUST GENERALLY

02:12:17.229 --> 02:12:20.932
TO ENSURE THAT WE DON'T LOSE. A

02:12:20.999 --> 02:12:22.100
GENERATION OF STUDENTS. ARE YOU

02:12:22.167 --> 02:12:23.535
ARE YOU THAT IT'S THE OLD OLDER

02:12:23.602 --> 02:12:25.037
STUDENTS. IS YOU WOULD THINK

02:12:25.103 --> 02:12:28.974
THAT THE YOUNGER STUDENTS WHICH

02:12:29.041 --> 02:12:30.776
I MEASURE OF THE PERCENTAGE

02:12:30.842 --> 02:12:32.344
WISE THAT YOU KNOW FRESH OUT OF

02:12:32.411 --> 02:12:33.812
HIGH SCHOOL ARE SIMILAR TO THE

02:12:33.879 --> 02:12:35.414
CSU STUDENTS WHERE THEY'RE

02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:36.748
THEY'RE THINKING HEY THIS IS AN

02:12:36.815 --> 02:12:38.383
OPPORTUNITY REALLY DO MORE AND

02:12:38.450 --> 02:12:40.385
TAKE MORE UNIT SO ARE YOU

02:12:40.452 --> 02:12:41.620
FINDING SOME OF YOUR YOUNGER

02:12:41.687 --> 02:12:44.890
STUDENTS ARE NOT ONLY. STICKING

02:12:44.956 --> 02:12:47.893
OUT BUT ALSO. TAKING MORE UNITS

02:12:47.959 --> 02:12:50.295
AND- TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE

02:12:50.362 --> 02:12:51.330
TIME THAT THERE. AT HOME

02:12:51.396 --> 02:12:55.067
SENSUAL. WE'RE WE'RE VERY WE'RE

02:12:55.133 --> 02:12:56.868
VERY INTERESTED IN DIGGING INTO

02:12:56.935 --> 02:12:59.304
OUR DATA WENT COME JANUARY WHEN

02:12:59.371 --> 02:13:02.774
WE HAVE ACTUAL NUMBERS- RIGHT

02:13:02.841 --> 02:13:03.775
NOW WE'RE REALLY WORKING ON

02:13:03.842 --> 02:13:05.310
SPECULATION BUT SOME OF THE

02:13:05.377 --> 02:13:07.012
THINGS THAT WE'VE LEARNED JUST

02:13:07.079 --> 02:13:09.581
ON SURVEY DATA. IS THAT IN

02:13:09.648 --> 02:13:11.616
SUMMER WE DID HAVE INCREASES IN

02:13:11.683 --> 02:13:14.286
ENROLLMENT SO THAT PLAYS INTO

02:13:14.353 --> 02:13:16.021
THIS CONCEPT THAT STUDENTS MAY

02:13:16.088 --> 02:13:17.889
HAVE BEEN NOT TAKING ADDITIONAL

02:13:17.956 --> 02:13:19.424
COURSES AS THEY PREPARED TO

02:13:19.491 --> 02:13:21.626
ENTER FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS

02:13:21.693 --> 02:13:24.296
MAKING UP COURSES. OF VARIOUS

02:13:24.363 --> 02:13:27.833
POSSIBLE SCENARIOS FOR FALL OF

02:13:27.899 --> 02:13:30.936
BECAUSE 40% OF OUR POPULATION

02:13:31.002 --> 02:13:34.139
IS ADULT LEARNERS ARE ASKED IF

02:13:34.206 --> 02:13:36.475
THEY HAVE DEPENDENTS THAT ALSO

02:13:36.541 --> 02:13:38.510
ARE BACK IN SCHOOL AND GYM

02:13:38.577 --> 02:13:40.379
CLASSES. WE BELIEVE THIS COULD

02:13:40.445 --> 02:13:41.947
HAVE ADDED ADDITIONAL PRESSURES

02:13:42.013 --> 02:13:44.883
ON THEIR OVERALL LIFE UP BUT

02:13:44.950 --> 02:13:46.785
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT AGAIN AS

02:13:46.852 --> 02:13:47.986
MENTIONED WE'RE VERY INTERESTED

02:13:48.053 --> 02:13:50.222
IN AND WILL ANALYZE ONCE WE GET

02:13:50.288 --> 02:13:55.394
FURTHER DATA ON FULL. TWENTY

02:13:55.460 --> 02:13:57.462
TWENTY COME JANUARY. OKAY THANK

02:13:57.529 --> 02:14:07.939
YOU. I THINK THAT KIND OF. DR

02:14:08.006 --> 02:14:09.941
THANK YOU AND WAS THAT YOU HAD

02:14:10.008 --> 02:14:12.511
A COMMENT- JUST A MOMENT AGO

02:14:12.577 --> 02:14:13.211
THAT I REALLY WANT TO DRILL

02:14:13.278 --> 02:14:15.080
INTO YOU SAID YOU NEED TO

02:14:15.147 --> 02:14:17.149
SUPPORT THEM AS INDIVIDUALS AND

02:14:17.215 --> 02:14:18.450
WHEN YOU SAID THAT THAT HAS

02:14:18.517 --> 02:14:20.085
ECHOES WITHIN HEALTH CARE FOR

02:14:20.152 --> 02:14:21.820
US TO THINK ABOUT SOCIAL

02:14:21.887 --> 02:14:23.622
DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. AND

02:14:23.688 --> 02:14:25.123
OFTENTIMES THERE ARE SOCIAL

02:14:25.190 --> 02:14:27.058
DETERMINANTS OF EDUCATION THAT

02:14:27.125 --> 02:14:28.593
ALLOW CERTAIN STUDENTS TO DO

02:14:28.660 --> 02:14:31.096
WELL OR TO PERFORM UNDER WHAT

02:14:31.163 --> 02:14:33.031
WE SHOULD EXPECT AND SO I GUESS

02:14:33.098 --> 02:14:34.599
MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS THAT

02:14:34.666 --> 02:14:36.134
SINCE YOU REPRESENT TWO MILLION

02:14:36.201 --> 02:14:37.402
STUDENTS AND THE COMMUNITY

02:14:37.469 --> 02:14:39.604

ROOTED AT. SUPPORTING OUR END

02:14:54.052 --> 02:14:56.321
OF IT THE INDIVIDUALS WE SERVE.

02:14:56.388 --> 02:14:58.523
SO WE HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES

02:14:58.590 --> 02:14:59.925
AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PUT

02:14:59.991 --> 02:15:01.793
TOGETHER THIS YEAR HAS BEEN ON

02:15:01.860 --> 02:15:03.862
A ONE TIME BASIS. ESSENTIALLY

02:15:03.929 --> 02:15:05.797
PULLING FROM FUNDS IN ONE PLACE

02:15:05.864 --> 02:15:07.699
TO SUPPLEMENT WITH OTHERS AND

02:15:07.766 --> 02:15:09.201
WE HAVE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY

02:15:09.267 --> 02:15:10.869

UNMATCHED. BY EITHER CARES OR

02:15:13.905 --> 02:15:15.640

02:15:15.707 --> 02:15:17.809
PIECES THAT WE ASK FOR IN ORDER

02:15:17.876 --> 02:15:19.544

HEALTH. NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS

02:15:21.446 --> 02:15:22.514
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THEY'VE

02:15:22.581 --> 02:15:24.916
HIGHLIGHTED IN MULTIPLE TOWN

02:15:24.983 --> 02:15:27.686

THE CHALLENGE OF THE PANDEMIC

02:16:46.631 --> 02:16:49.668

OR DROP AWAY- AT SOME POINT IN

02:17:07.619 --> 02:17:09.421
TIME THAT THAT MAYBE WE LEARNED

02:17:09.487 --> 02:17:11.022
SOME LESSONS IN THE SPRING THAT

02:17:11.089 --> 02:17:12.958
THAT WE TOOK WITH US THIS FALL

02:17:13.024 --> 02:17:13.858
HOW WE'VE BEEN STRENGTHENING

CONTINUES TO BE AVAILABLE TO

02:18:05.143 --> 02:18:07.545
DISTRICTS THAT THEY CAN UTILIZE

02:18:07.612 --> 02:18:09.347
IF A STUDENT EVER FACES AN

02:18:09.414 --> 02:18:11.950
EMERGENCY SUCH AS A PANDEMIC.

02:18:12.017 --> 02:18:13.618
HAVING THE WIDESPREAD KNOWLEDGE

02:18:13.685 --> 02:18:15.387
OF THIS AS A WAY TO NOT

02:18:15.453 --> 02:18:17.288
PENALIZE STUDENTS FINANCIAL

BECAUSE- WE WANT TO DO

02:18:43.915 --> 02:18:45.283
EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO KEEP

02:19:35.400 --> 02:19:37.535
KIND OF STATIC- BUT NONETHELESS

02:19:37.602 --> 02:19:38.503
THERE ARE STUDENTS WHO ARE

02:19:38.570 --> 02:19:39.738

WITH LESS. WE CANNOT ASK MORE

02:54:50.446 --> 02:54:52.481

EVERY CABINET MEETING THAT I

02:55:07.630 --> 02:55:10.833
WHAT ARE WE NOT GOING TO DO.

02:55:10.900 --> 02:55:13.202
NOW WE WILL ALSO ASK OURSELVES

02:55:13.269 --> 02:55:14.570
WHAT ARE WE NOT GOING TO DO

02:55:14.637 --> 02:55:16.906
THAT WILL NOT HAVE ANY HARM TO

02:55:16.973 --> 02:55:19.342
OUR STUDENTS. SO WE LOOK AT

02:55:19.408 --> 02:55:22.144
THINGS THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF OUR

02:55:22.211 --> 02:55:24.647
STUDENTS AND THEIR SUCCESS. WE

02:55:24.714 --> 02:55:26.716
SPENT FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION

02:55:26.782 --> 02:55:28.985
DOLLARS ON EXTRA SECTIONS THIS

02:55:29.051 --> 02:55:31.053
SEMESTER SO THAT WE CAN KEEP

02:55:31.120 --> 02:55:33.089
OUR GRADUATION RATES MOVING

02:55:33.155 --> 02:55:37.093
FORWARD. THAT IS ESSENTIAL WE

02:55:37.159 --> 02:55:37.593
HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT IS A

02:55:37.660 --> 02:55:40.329
CENTRAL. I'VE ASKED MY CABINET

02:55:40.396 --> 02:55:42.565
AND OTHERS TO CUT THEIR LITTLE

02:55:42.632 --> 02:55:44.934
DARLINGS LITTLE DARLINGS IS A

02:55:45.001 --> 02:55:48.905
PHRASE FROM HEMMING WAY AND ONE

02:55:48.971 --> 02:55:52.141
HEMINGWAY WITH A HE SAID IF IT.

02:55:52.208 --> 02:55:53.276
WAS SOMETHING THAT HE LOVED IT

02:55:53.342 --> 02:55:55.211
PROBABLY WASN'T SOMETHING THAT

02:55:55.278 --> 02:55:59.815
HE REALLY NEEDED. AND SO WE'RE

02:55:59.882 --> 02:56:00.416
LOOKING AT THOSE THINGS TO BE

02:56:00.483 --> 02:56:01.851

ANNOUNCED AND I APPRECIATE THAT

02:56:16.465 --> 02:56:17.767

02:56:17.833 --> 02:56:19.869
THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO ASK ANY

02:56:19.936 --> 02:56:21.771

OTHER SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT. I'M

03:01:25.908 --> 03:01:28.310
ACTUALLY PART OF THAT 75% I

DISCUSSIONS WERE GROUP WORKER

03:01:56.905 --> 03:01:59.408
CASE REVIEWS. AND THE REASON

03:01:59.475 --> 03:02:01.243
FOR THAT IS IT INCREASES

03:02:01.310 --> 03:02:02.878
LEARNING AND KEEP STUDENTS

03:02:02.945 --> 03:02:04.446

03:02:15.424 --> 03:02:17.293
WHAT THEY'VE JUST HEARD TO HELP

03:02:17.359 --> 03:02:19.261
MAKE THE MATERIAL STICKIER AND

03:02:19.328 --> 03:02:21.030
TO HELP THEM REALLY LEARN IT

03:02:21.096 --> 03:02:22.464
WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE TO MAKE

03:02:22.531 --> 03:02:24.266
MULTIPLE RECORDED MANY LECTURES

03:02:24.333 --> 03:02:26.068
AND CREATE MULTIPLE SMALL

03:02:26.135 --> 03:02:27.269

TIME. ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTIONS

03:02:33.375 --> 03:02:34.877
GRADING CRITERIA ALL OF THAT

03:02:34.943 --> 03:02:37.212
HAS TO BE CRYSTAL CLEAR BECAUSE

03:02:37.279 --> 03:02:38.447

AN ONLINE OR ON GROUND COURSE.

03:02:44.920 --> 03:02:46.522
SO THIS REQUIRED A TREMENDOUS

03:02:46.588 --> 03:02:48.691
AMOUNT OF WORK. AND IT USUALLY

03:02:48.757 --> 03:02:51.293
TAKES MONTHS TO TRANSLATE AN ON

03:02:51.360 --> 03:02:52.094
GROUND COURSE TO AN ONLINE

03:02:52.161 --> 03:02:55.497

TO ENSURE A HIGH QUALITY

03:03:13.549 --> 03:03:16.285
EDUCATION DURING THIS CRISIS.

03:03:16.352 --> 03:03:17.252
UNIVERSITIES HAVE HAD TO ACT

PROMOTING FACULTY COMMUNITIES

03:04:08.303 --> 03:04:10.372
OF PRACTICE SO THAT FACULTY

SELF STUDY VERSION OF THAT

03:04:18.313 --> 03:04:20.749
INTENSIVE. ODD TO HOPE TO ALLOW

03:04:20.816 --> 03:04:22.418
FACULTY WHO COULDN'T MAKE IT TO

03:04:22.484 --> 03:04:24.253
THE IN PERSON TRAINING TO DO

03:04:24.319 --> 03:04:26.388
THE SELF STUDY ON THEIR OWN.

03:04:26.455 --> 03:04:28.357
FACULTY WERE VERY RESPONSIVE TO

THREE TIMES SINCE MARCH. ASKING

03:05:00.088 --> 03:05:01.757
WHAT SUPPORT SERVICES LEARNING

03:05:01.824 --> 03:05:04.593
TOOLS ARE WORKING WELL AND WHAT

03:05:04.660 --> 03:05:05.160
ARE THEIR EVOLVING NEEDS FOR

03:05:05.227 --> 03:05:07.429
SUPPORT. THE CHALLENGES WE

03:05:07.496 --> 03:05:09.398
FACED OBVIOUSLY WITH THE TIME

03:05:09.465 --> 03:05:11.400
FRAME THAT WE HAD IN WHICH TO

03:05:11.467 --> 03:05:12.868
MAKE THE CHANGE THAT WAS A BIG

03:05:12.935 --> 03:05:15.838
CHALLENGE. THE DIFFERENTIAL AND

03:05:15.904 --> 03:05:17.506
FAMILIARITY AND COMFORT LEVEL

03:05:17.573 --> 03:05:20.476
OF BOTH FACULTY AND STAFF AND

03:05:20.542 --> 03:05:22.911
STUDENTS IN ONLINE TEACHING AND

03:05:22.978 --> 03:05:25.280
LEARNING. A SMALL NUMBER HAVE

03:05:25.347 --> 03:05:26.515
NEVER HAD NEVER LOGGED INTO OUR

03:05:26.582 --> 03:05:28.484
LMS AND SO WE HAD FOLKS WHO

03:05:28.550 --> 03:05:29.551
WERE VERY COMFORTABLE WITH

03:05:29.618 --> 03:05:31.620
TECHNOLOGY AND WE HAD FOLKS WHO

03:05:31.687 --> 03:05:33.555
REALLY HAD TO PROVIDE MUCH MORE

03:05:33.622 --> 03:05:35.357
INTENSIVE SUPPORT TO HELP THEM

03:05:35.424 --> 03:05:36.959
GET COMFORTABLE WITH THAT. WITH

03:05:37.025 --> 03:05:39.962
THOSE TOOLS. AND THEN THE THIRD

03:05:40.028 --> 03:05:41.463
CHALLENGE WAS CREATING SUPPORT

03:05:41.530 --> 03:05:43.031
RESOURCES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF

03:05:43.098 --> 03:05:44.399
FACULTY AND STUDENTS

03:05:44.466 --> 03:05:46.435
IMMEDIATELY AS THOSE THOSE

03:05:46.502 --> 03:05:49.204
NEEDS EMERGED. THE POSITIVES

03:05:49.271 --> 03:05:50.205
THAT HAVE COME OUT OF THIS FOR

03:05:50.272 --> 03:05:52.074
US HAS BEEN A RENEWED FOCUS ON

03:05:52.140 --> 03:05:55.310
TEACHING. THERE'S BEEN AN

03:05:55.377 --> 03:05:56.545
UNEXPECTED OPPORTUNITY TO

03:05:56.612 --> 03:05:59.014
REFLECT ON OUR COURSES AND TO

03:05:59.081 --> 03:06:00.916
AND ARE TEACHING STRATEGIES.

03:06:00.983 --> 03:06:02.751
WHEN WE LOOK AT TEACHING OUR

03:06:02.818 --> 03:06:04.152
COURSES IN A DIFFERENT WAY IT

03:06:04.219 --> 03:06:05.888
REALLY FORCES US TO THINK ABOUT

03:06:05.954 --> 03:06:07.422
WHAT WE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH

03:06:07.489 --> 03:06:08.357
AND WHAT KINDS OF STRATEGIES

03:06:08.423 --> 03:06:10.592
ARE USING. AND HAVE THOSE BEEN

03:06:10.659 --> 03:06:12.561
EFFECTIVE AND WHEN WE THINK

03:06:12.628 --> 03:06:13.896
ABOUT WHAT KINDS OF TOOLS ARE

03:06:13.962 --> 03:06:15.364
AVAILABLE TO US ONLINE

03:06:15.430 --> 03:06:16.732
SOMETIMES THERE'S A BETTER WAY

03:06:16.798 --> 03:06:19.101
TO DO IT THAN THE WAY WE'VE

03:06:19.167 --> 03:06:20.168
BEEN DOING IT FOR YEARS. IT'S

03:06:20.235 --> 03:06:21.904
ALSO GIVING FACULTY A CHANCE TO

03:06:21.970 --> 03:06:23.405
REVIEW. BEST TEACHING

03:06:23.472 --> 03:06:26.475
PRACTICES. AND TO GET MORE

03:06:26.542 --> 03:06:27.042
EXPOSURE TO ONLINE LEARNING

03:06:27.109 --> 03:06:30.112
TOOLS. A BIG TAKE AWAYS FROM

03:06:30.178 --> 03:06:31.079
THIS AND I'M SURE THAT THESE

03:06:31.146 --> 03:06:32.881
ARE HAPPENING- AT OUR STATE

03:06:32.948 --> 03:06:35.217
AND- INDEPENDENT INSTITUTION

03:06:35.284 --> 03:06:37.486
COLLEAGUES AS WELL. IS IT

03:06:37.553 --> 03:06:39.621
FACULTY AND STUDENTS ARE VERY

03:06:39.688 --> 03:06:42.057
ENGAGED STAFF FOR SUPPORTING

03:06:42.124 --> 03:06:44.192
THE WORK THAT'S GOING ON AND

03:06:44.259 --> 03:06:46.295
LEARNING ONLINE IS WORKING.

03:06:46.361 --> 03:06:47.829
FACULTY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE

03:06:47.896 --> 03:06:49.831
SUPPORT FOR THEIR TEACHING WHEN

03:06:49.898 --> 03:06:52.367
IT HAS VALUE. WHEN IT MEETS

03:06:52.434 --> 03:06:53.735
THEIR NEEDS AND WHEN IT'S

03:06:53.802 --> 03:06:56.471
OFFERED THROUGH MULTIPLE MODES

03:06:56.538 --> 03:06:57.072
IN ORDER TO FIT THEIR VARYING

03:06:57.139 --> 03:06:59.207
SCHEDULES. AND FINALLY THE

03:06:59.274 --> 03:07:01.009
FLEXIBILITY THE ONLINE TEACHING

03:07:01.076 --> 03:07:03.478
TOOLS PROVIDE ALLOW FACULTY

03:07:03.545 --> 03:07:05.247
MORE CHOICES TO HELP STUDENTS

03:07:05.314 --> 03:07:07.649
LEARN SO THE MORE WE CAN

03:07:07.716 --> 03:07:08.717
SUPPORT THOSE TOOLS THE BETTER.

03:07:08.784 --> 03:07:10.152
AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY

03:07:10.218 --> 03:07:12.321
QUESTIONS THANK YOU DR CLARK.

03:07:12.387 --> 03:07:15.424
QUESTIONS REGARDING. I DO HAVE

03:07:15.490 --> 03:07:17.092
A QUESTION I WAS A CLASSROOM

03:07:17.159 --> 03:07:19.628
TEACHER. WITH A DOG FOR THIRTY

03:07:19.695 --> 03:07:21.630
FOUR YEARS I SPENT- IN THE

03:07:21.697 --> 03:07:24.099
CLASSROOM TEACHING IN THE

AN OPPORTUNITY OR OR NEED TO DO

03:07:28.837 --> 03:07:30.305
ONLINE TEACHING BUT ONE OF THE

03:07:30.372 --> 03:07:31.840
THINGS ABOUT TEACHING IN THE

03:07:31.907 --> 03:07:33.842
CLASSROOM IS THAT YOU SEE THE

03:07:33.909 --> 03:07:35.577
STUDENTS IN FRONT OF YOU. AND

03:07:35.644 --> 03:07:38.513
YOU CA WHEN THEY'RE GETTING

03:07:38.580 --> 03:07:40.215
SOMETHING WHEN THEY'RE CATCHING

03:07:40.282 --> 03:07:42.084
ON AND WHEN THEY'RE NOT. I

03:07:42.150 --> 03:07:44.353
THINK STUDENTS IN THE CLASSROOM

03:07:44.419 --> 03:07:46.922
ALSO. PROBABLY AS OPPOSED TO

03:07:46.989 --> 03:07:49.958

03:07:50.025 --> 03:07:52.661
RAZOR AND- ASK A QUESTION A-

03:07:52.728 --> 03:07:54.930
TEACHER THE PROFESSOR BALANCES

03:07:54.997 --> 03:07:57.165
DISCUSSION. OF MAKING SURE THAT

03:07:57.232 --> 03:07:58.367
THOSE STUDENTS WHO ARE MORE

03:07:58.433 --> 03:08:00.802
HESITANT TO SPEAK UP. TO SPEAK

03:08:00.869 --> 03:08:03.772
UP. I'VE I'VE HEARD A LOT OF

03:08:03.839 --> 03:08:06.041
THOSE THINGS YOU KNOW CAN'T OR

03:08:06.108 --> 03:08:09.111
DON'T HAPPEN ONLINE ESPECIALLY

03:08:09.177 --> 03:08:12.214
IF IT'S A- ONLINE DISCUSSION-

03:08:12.280 --> 03:08:13.882
YOU KNOW TEACH A PROFESSOR AT

03:08:13.949 --> 03:08:15.450
INTERACTING WITH STUDENTS WHAT

WHAT WHAT CAN PROFESSORS AND

03:08:17.085 --> 03:08:20.789
TEACHERS DUE. TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:08:20.856 --> 03:08:22.724
THE STUDENTS WHO MAY HAVE A

03:08:22.791 --> 03:08:24.493
QUESTION OR THE STUDENT WHO'S

03:08:24.559 --> 03:08:26.261
HESITANT TO PARTICIPATE

03:08:26.328 --> 03:08:28.964
ESPECIALLY ONLINE DOES AND I

03:08:29.031 --> 03:08:30.432
WOULD THINK THAT YOU KNOW FIRST

03:08:30.499 --> 03:08:33.902
GENERATION A LOWER INCOME A

03:08:33.969 --> 03:08:36.371
STUDENTS MAY. MAY BE IN THAT

03:08:36.438 --> 03:08:38.874
AREA MORE THAN THAN OTHER

03:08:38.940 --> 03:08:43.045
STUDENTS. THAT QUESTION THANK

03:08:43.111 --> 03:08:45.047
YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- I COME

03:08:45.113 --> 03:08:46.214
FROM A FAMILY OF TEACHERS MY

03:08:46.281 --> 03:08:47.616
SISTER AND BROTHER IN LAW ARE

03:08:47.683 --> 03:08:49.451
TEACHERS AND WE'VE HAD SOME

03:08:49.518 --> 03:08:50.786
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT THE

03:08:50.852 --> 03:08:52.954
CHALLENGES HAVE BEEN. IN ONLINE

03:08:53.021 --> 03:08:54.690
TEACHING AND THIS IS DEFINITELY

03:08:54.756 --> 03:08:55.891
SOMETHING THAT OUR FACULTY HAVE

03:08:55.957 --> 03:08:57.959
TALKED ABOUT AS WELL. IS HOW DO

03:08:58.026 --> 03:09:01.163
I GET HOW DO I GET A GAUGE FOR

03:09:01.229 --> 03:09:01.630
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN MY

03:09:01.697 --> 03:09:04.599
CLASSROOM AND IT. IT IS A BIT

03:09:04.666 --> 03:09:06.101
LIKE LEARNING A NEW LANGUAGE

03:09:06.168 --> 03:09:08.603
YOU DO HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO

03:09:08.670 --> 03:09:09.805
LOOK FOR THINGS A LITTLE BIT

03:09:09.871 --> 03:09:11.473
DIFFERENT. DIFFERENTLY THAN YOU

03:09:11.540 --> 03:09:14.142
WOULD IN PERSON. WHEN YOU'RE

03:09:14.209 --> 03:09:14.743
WHEN YOU'RE INTERACTING WITH

03:09:14.810 --> 03:09:16.678
STUDENTS ONLINE. AND WHAT THAT

03:09:16.745 --> 03:09:18.246
MEANS IS THAT YOU CAN BE MORE

03:09:18.313 --> 03:09:20.315
AND ARE ACTIVE WITH YOUR

03:09:20.382 --> 03:09:22.050
STUDENTS YOU CAN YOU CAN.

03:09:22.117 --> 03:09:23.585
ORGANIZER CLASS SO THAT THERE

03:09:23.652 --> 03:09:25.253
ARE MORE CHECK INS WITH

03:09:25.320 --> 03:09:28.290
STUDENTS- AND FRANKLY I'VE HAD

03:09:28.356 --> 03:09:29.624
FACULTY TELL ME AND I'VE HAD

03:09:29.691 --> 03:09:31.860
THIS EXPERIENCE AS WELL. USING

03:09:31.927 --> 03:09:34.229
THINGS LIKE CHAT FEATURES. OR

03:09:34.296 --> 03:09:36.031
BREAKOUT ROOMS CAN ACTUALLY

03:09:36.098 --> 03:09:38.500
ALLOW STUDENTS TO PARTICIPATE

03:09:38.567 --> 03:09:40.635
LESS IN IN PERSON CLASSES. AS

03:09:40.702 --> 03:09:42.037
IT ALLOWS THEM TO PARTICIPATE

03:09:42.104 --> 03:09:43.004
IN A WAY THAT MAYBE THEY

03:09:43.071 --> 03:09:44.439
HAVEN'T BEFORE BECAUSE IT FEELS

03:09:44.506 --> 03:09:46.274
A LITTLE LESS INTIMIDATING TO

03:09:46.341 --> 03:09:47.142
GET ON A CHAT AND RIGHT WHAT

03:09:47.209 --> 03:09:48.610
YOU'RE SAYING. AS OPPOSED TO

03:09:48.677 --> 03:09:51.213
HAVING TO SAY IT- VERBALLY AND

03:09:51.279 --> 03:09:53.081
SO. THAT'S SOME OF THE THINGS

03:09:53.148 --> 03:09:53.849
THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH

03:09:53.915 --> 03:09:55.517
OUR FACULTY IS TO FIND

03:09:55.584 --> 03:09:56.151
DIFFERENT WAYS TO CONNECT WITH

03:09:56.218 --> 03:09:58.553
THEIR STUDENTS. AND FIND WAYS

03:09:58.620 --> 03:09:59.721
TO ALLOW THEIR STUDENTS TO

03:09:59.788 --> 03:10:01.356
ENGAGE IN THE CLASS THAT MAYBE

03:10:01.423 --> 03:10:04.092
IS DIFFERENT FROM TRADITIONAL

03:10:04.159 --> 03:10:05.327
ONLINE INSTRUCTION. CHAU FROM

03:10:05.393 --> 03:10:09.197
HOW YOUR DISK. IT THE TEACHING.

03:10:09.264 --> 03:10:11.666
AT USC YOU YOU YOU IT SOUNDS

03:10:11.733 --> 03:10:14.035
LIKE YOU DON'T THINK ANY. ANY

03:10:14.102 --> 03:10:16.505
ANYTHING HAS REALLY BEEN LOST-

03:10:16.571 --> 03:10:19.941
IN SHIFTING TO. TO ONLINE

03:10:20.008 --> 03:10:23.812
EDUCATION. AS FAR AS LEARNING.

03:10:23.879 --> 03:10:26.248
WELL I THINK THE TRACK. I THINK

03:10:26.314 --> 03:10:27.582
THE TRANSITION HAS BEEN

03:10:27.649 --> 03:10:29.818
DIFFICULT FOR EVERYONE- BUT WE

03:10:29.885 --> 03:10:31.920
ARE HEARING FROM FACULTY THAT

03:10:31.987 --> 03:10:35.724
THEY'VE- THEY'VE FOUND NEW

03:10:35.791 --> 03:10:37.259
TOOLS OR NEW WAYS OF DOING

03:10:37.325 --> 03:10:38.994
THINGS THAT. THEY HADN'T

03:10:39.060 --> 03:10:40.896
THOUGHT OF BEFORE SO WHILE THE

03:10:40.962 --> 03:10:42.464
TRANSITION WAS DIFFICULT FOR

03:10:42.531 --> 03:10:44.432
EVERYONE I THINK AND YOU KNOW I

03:10:44.499 --> 03:10:45.934
THINK FOR ALL OF US WE WERE IN

03:10:46.001 --> 03:10:49.738
A BIT OF. DENIAL FOR AWHILE

03:10:49.805 --> 03:10:50.338
HOPING THIS WOULD ALL JUST GO

03:10:50.405 --> 03:10:50.939
QUICKLY AND THEN WE'D HAVE TO

03:10:51.006 --> 03:10:52.874
DO IT FOR A FEW WEEKS. OVERTIME

03:10:52.941 --> 03:10:55.377
IS THE REALITY SET IN WE SORT

03:10:55.443 --> 03:10:57.078
OF DUGGAR HEELS IN AND TRIED TO

03:10:57.145 --> 03:10:58.847
FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW HOW CAN WE

03:10:58.914 --> 03:11:00.882
MAKE THIS WORK WELL AND I THINK

03:11:00.949 --> 03:11:02.684
OUR FACULTY IN AND IT SOUNDS

03:11:02.751 --> 03:11:06.021
pHAVE BEEN WORKING REALLY HARD

03:11:06.087 --> 03:11:06.822
TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE REACHING

03:11:06.888 --> 03:11:08.824
THEIR STUDENTS AND THAT

03:11:08.890 --> 03:11:10.525
EFFECTIVE WAY. AND MY LAST

03:11:10.592 --> 03:11:11.993
QUESTION DO YOU THINK THAT

03:11:12.060 --> 03:11:12.627
THERE WILL BE THINGS THAT WE

03:11:12.694 --> 03:11:14.496
LEARNED. DURING THIS PANDEMIC

03:11:14.563 --> 03:11:15.997
USING DISTANCE LEARNING THAT

03:11:16.064 --> 03:11:19.434
WILL- CONTINUED AFTER THE

03:11:19.501 --> 03:11:22.504
PANDEMIC. IN THE WAY WE TEACH

03:11:22.571 --> 03:11:23.338
THE WAY WE INTERACT WITH OUR

03:11:23.405 --> 03:11:26.308
STUDENTS. ABSOLUTELY I'VE- I

03:11:26.374 --> 03:11:28.710
THINK- YOU KNOW AS I SAID

03:11:28.777 --> 03:11:30.779
BEFORE THE FACULTY HAVE BEEN

03:11:30.846 --> 03:11:32.781
DISCOVERING WAYS TO CONNECT

03:11:32.848 --> 03:11:34.850
WITH THEIR STUDENTS ONLINE

03:11:34.916 --> 03:11:37.185
THAT. THEY DIDN'T HAVE ON

03:11:37.252 --> 03:11:38.687
GROUND. BUT THERE'S NO REASON

03:11:38.753 --> 03:11:40.088
THAT THEY COULDN'T CONTINUE TO

03:11:40.155 --> 03:11:41.523
USE SOME OF THESE ONLINE TOOLS

03:11:41.590 --> 03:11:42.958
EVEN WHEN THEY GO BACK TO FACE

03:11:43.024 --> 03:11:45.560
TO FACE INSTRUCTION. SO FOR

03:11:45.627 --> 03:11:46.962
INSTANCE YOU KNOW ALLOWING-

03:11:47.028 --> 03:11:50.332
DOING POLLING DURING CLASS. CAN

03:11:50.398 --> 03:11:51.333
SOMETIMES GET A GAUGE OF

03:11:51.399 --> 03:11:53.068
WHETHER STUDENTS ARE ARE

03:11:53.134 --> 03:11:54.502

03:11:57.272 --> 03:11:59.307
ADJUSTMENT IN YOUR INSTRUCTION

03:11:59.374 --> 03:12:00.709
IN THAT MOMENT. THAT'S

03:12:00.775 --> 03:12:01.810
SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF FACULTY

03:12:01.877 --> 03:12:03.778
HAVEN'T HAD ACCESS TO BUT AFTER

03:12:03.845 --> 03:12:05.146
HAVING ACCESS TO IT THROUGH

03:12:05.213 --> 03:12:07.082
THEM. THERE ARE OTHER TOOLS

03:12:07.148 --> 03:12:08.683
THAT YOU CAN USE IN FACE TO

03:12:08.750 --> 03:12:09.985

FOR EXAMPLE- TECHNOLOGY IN

03:16:09.324 --> 03:16:12.227
BROADBAND ISSUES. ARE ARE

03:16:12.293 --> 03:16:12.861
EXISTING IN IN OUR SYSTEM RIGHT

03:16:12.927 --> 03:16:15.263

BUT THIS RESOURCES IS NOT

03:16:20.468 --> 03:16:22.370
AVAILABLE TO ALL STUDENTS.

03:16:22.437 --> 03:16:23.972
SPECIFICALLY AT MY COLLEGE AT

03:16:24.038 --> 03:16:24.839
THE BEGINNING OF THE FALL%

03:16:24.906 --> 03:16:26.541
SEMESTER SEMESTER THERE WAS A

03:16:26.608 --> 03:16:28.877
TWO WEEK WAITING PERIOD FOR ANY

03:16:28.943 --> 03:16:29.944
STUDENT THAT WANTED TO GET A

03:16:30.011 --> 03:16:32.347
COMPUTER WHY FIVE BECAUSE THOSE

RESOURCES WERE NOT AVAILABLE AT

03:16:33.047 --> 03:16:34.849
THAT TIME. SO FOR THE FIRST TWO

03:16:34.916 --> 03:16:36.317
WEEKS OF SCHOOL WE HAD STUDENTS

03:16:36.384 --> 03:16:37.619

OF THOSE RESOURCES BECAUSE THE

03:16:42.924 --> 03:16:44.659
RESOURCES WERE NOT THERE. I

03:16:44.726 --> 03:16:46.027
ALSO LIVE IN A RURAL PART OF

03:16:46.094 --> 03:16:47.562
THE CENTRAL VALLEY. OR

03:16:47.629 --> 03:16:48.997
BROADBAND INTERNET. IS NOT

03:16:49.063 --> 03:16:50.298
REALLY READILY AVAILABLE THERE

03:16:50.365 --> 03:16:52.333
IS NO XFINITY. SATELLITE

03:16:52.400 --> 03:16:53.868
INTERNET IS NOT FAST ENOUGH FOR

03:16:53.935 --> 03:16:55.603
ME TO BE ABLE TO GET ON TO DO.

03:16:55.670 --> 03:16:57.338
SO I HAD TO ACT ACTUALLY

03:16:57.405 --> 03:16:59.507
PURCHASE A SECOND CELL PHONE TO

03:17:09.284 --> 03:17:10.618
THE RESOURCE LIKE I DO AT THE

AND THE RESOURCES EXIST FOR

03:17:22.163 --> 03:17:24.232
THEM TO UTILIZE. BUT THEIR

03:17:24.299 --> 03:17:25.300
RESOURCES ARE NOT AS READILY

03:17:25.366 --> 03:17:27.035
AVAILABLE AS THEY WERE WHEN

03:17:27.101 --> 03:17:28.136
THEY WERE IN PERSON. MY SCHOOL

03:17:28.203 --> 03:17:29.804

03:17:29.871 --> 03:17:31.606

STUDENTS DON'T JUST EXPERIENCE

03:17:34.475 --> 03:17:35.009
FOOD INSECURITY IS TWO DAYS A

03:17:35.076 --> 03:17:36.978
WEEK. I'M FORTUNATE BECAUSE I

THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO- YOU KNOW.

03:17:42.951 --> 03:17:43.952

THIS PANDEMIC FOUR YEARS AGO

03:17:56.564 --> 03:17:57.365
WHEN I FIRST CAME INTO THE

03:17:57.432 --> 03:17:58.466

I LOOK TO THOSE STUDENTS THAT

03:18:06.074 --> 03:18:08.309
ARE IN THAT SITUATION NOW. AND

03:18:08.376 --> 03:18:10.445

EVERY DAY. AND THEY'RE STILL

03:18:21.189 --> 03:18:22.290
STUDENTS OUT THERE THAT NEED

03:18:22.357 --> 03:18:23.691
THAT RESOURCES DAILY AND IF

03:18:23.758 --> 03:18:25.994
THOSE RESOURCES ARE JUST NOT

03:18:26.060 --> 03:18:28.496

LEASES SO I THINK YOU. SO MUCH

03:18:32.066 --> 03:18:32.734
CHAIRMAN ENOUGH FOR BRINGING

03:18:32.800 --> 03:18:33.568
THAT UP BECAUSE IN THE

03:18:33.635 --> 03:18:34.936
CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE

THE BEGINNING OF THIS PANDEMIC

03:18:55.089 --> 03:18:55.657
I THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD

03:18:55.723 --> 03:18:57.825
BECOME MORE READILY AVAILABLE.

03:18:57.892 --> 03:18:59.894
AND OVER TIME THEY HAVE BEEN.

03:18:59.961 --> 03:19:01.229
BUT NOW THAT THERE ARE STUDENTS

03:19:01.296 --> 03:19:02.297

03:19:02.363 --> 03:19:03.831
TECHNOLOGY TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS

03:19:03.898 --> 03:19:05.633

THEY'RE ACTUALLY SERVING JUST

03:19:13.041 --> 03:19:14.108
THOSE THAT HAVE RELIABLE

03:19:14.175 --> 03:19:16.077
INTERNET. THE TIME TO TAKE OUT

03:19:16.144 --> 03:19:17.011
OF THEIR DAY TO BE ABLE TO DO

03:19:17.078 --> 03:19:19.047
THAT. AND THE TECHNOLOGY THAT

03:19:19.113 --> 03:19:21.783
TAKES TWO TO. BE A PART OF

03:19:21.849 --> 03:19:23.818

CONSTANT FEAR THIS MINDSET IS

03:33:06.440 --> 03:33:08.075
FAR MORE UNHEALTHY THAN THE
