OKAY SEC HOURS A DOT ORG IS A CALENDAR IS ADOPTED WE WILL NOW HEAR FROM MYSTERY OF US THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COLLEAGUES- PROUD TO PRESENT A COUPLE OF BILLS HERE START WITH- AB SIXTEEN TWENTY SIX AND FIRST I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS AS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS AND I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT THIS LEGISLATION TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY IN REDUCES FIRE RISKS. HERE CALIFORNIA. I PRESENT TO THE FIRE SAFETY ACT IT PROHIBITS. THE CIGARETTES FROM BEING SOLD IN OUR STATE UNLESS THEY MEET NATION WIDE REDUCED IGNITION STANDARDS NOW THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL IS IN CHARGE OF REVIEWING SUBMISSIONS TO VERIFY FIRE SAFETY. BUT THESE PRODUCTS ARE DEEMED APPROVED SHOULD THE FIRE MARSHAL TAKE NO ACTION WITHIN- THE TEN- BUSINESS DAYS AND THAT HAS LED TO MANY MANUFACTURE PROPOSE MARKINGS BEING APPROVED BY DEFAULT SO THAT'S WITHOUT PROPER REVIEW SO THIS BILL WOULD GIVE THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE THE FIRE SAFETY ACT AND IT EXTENDS THE TEN DAY AUTOMATIC APPROVAL- APPROVAL ROLE. TO THE THIRD EXCUSE WITH THE THIRTY DAYS- SO AGAIN THIS BILL WOULD STRAIGHTEN THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE FIRE SAFETY ACT TO REDUCE THE RISK OF FIRES CAUSED BY- SOME CIGARETTES AND SO WITH US HERE TODAY ARE- SOME REPRESENTATIVES FROM- THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE THE FIRST IS THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL RENUKA GEORGE AND ALSO- KAREN LEAF WHO'S THE SENIOR ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS RUNNING COULD GEORGE AND I'M THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL WHAT THE OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ON BEHALF OF EIJI VÃ  SERRA I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. AB SIXTEEN TWENTY SIX AMENDS CALIFORNIA FIRE SAFETY ACCESS TO MOVE ADMINISTRATION OF THE ACT OVER TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WHO WILL ENSURE THAT CIGARETTES SOLD IN CALIFORNIA. MEET SPECIFIC SELF EXTINGUISHING A FIRE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS. HER CURRENTLY THE FIRE SAFETY ACT PROHIBITS CIGARETTES FROM BEING SOLD IN CALIFORNIA UNLESS THE MANUFACTURER PROVIDES THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL WITH CERTIFICATION ESTABLISHING THAT ITS PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN MANUFACTURED AND TESTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH CERTAIN NATIONWIDE REDUCED. IGNITION PROPENSITY STANDARDS. THOSE CIGARETTES THAT HAVE THAT HAVE NOT BEEN CERTIFIED THAT THEY MEET THE STANDARDS ARE HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED BY THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL CANNOT BE SOLD IN CALIFORNIA. HOWEVER AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER NOTED AT THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL DOES NOT TAKE ACTION WITHIN TEN DAYS AFTER THE CIGARETTE MANUFACTURERS PROVIDE THEIR CERTIFICATION THE CIGARETTES ARE AUTOMATICALLY. I DEEMED APPROVED BY DEFAULT THE TWENTY GENERAL'S OFFICE IS THE STATE AGENCY CHARGED WITH ENFORCING THE ACT AND ENSURING THAT ONLY FIRE SAFE CIGARETTES ARE SOLD IN CALIFORNIA. ADMINISTRATION OF THE ACT IS VITAL TO CALIFORNIA'S TOBACCO ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS UNFORTUNATELY IN RECENT YEARS DURING TO FUNDING CONSTRAINTS THERE HAS BEEN LIMITED REVIEW OF THE FIRE SAFETY CERTIFICATIONS. APPROVAL OF PROPOSED MARKINGS BY DEFAULT HAS IMPAIR THE STATE'S ABILITY TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY. ULTIMATELY AB SIXTEEN TWENTY SIX IS A GOOD GOVERNANCE AND EFFICIENCY MEASURE THE BILL REDUCES COSTS FOR THE STATE'S BECAUSE IT CONSOLIDATES THE OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE FIRE SAFETY AFTER ONE STATE AGENCY. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WHICH IT USES THE NUMBER OF SUBMISSIONS REGULATORY. COMMISSION AND REGULATORY FEES FOR THE MYSTERY TO ME. THANK YOU FOR I'M INTERESTED. FOR ANY ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY AT THIS TIME. HELLO MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME'S AFRICA VARGAS AND ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE FIREFIGHTERS ASSOCIATION WE'RE STRONG SUPPORT WE WERE ONE OF THE ORIGINAL CO SPONSORS OF THIS LEGISLATION WITH THAT MISTER CHRIS BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE AND- SO THANK YOU FOR MAKING ME FEEL OLD. ANY PUBLIC SUPPORT. SEEING NONE OF THE OPPOSITION. SIGNAL RATE BACK TO THE MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS WHICH COOPER HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE G. STAFF IS FAR AS THE ILLICIT CIGARETTES THE BLACK MARKET- I WAS THERE MAKE IT IS DIFFERENT. WHAT IS IT IS OFFICE DOING TO COMBAT THAT. I WOULD HAVE DONE. THANK YOU- FOR THE QUESTION IT TURNING GENERAL'S OFFICE IS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT- THE SALES OF ILLICIT CIGARETTES IN THE STATE ALL IN IS TAKING A NUMBER OF ACTIONS OF THE IN TO ENFORCE RECENTLY THE- CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE SUED THE ACTUALLY THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE. BECAUSE IT IS ACCEPTING FOR DELIVERY AND DELIVERING TO CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS LARGE QUANTITIES OF CIGARETTES THAT ARE COMING FROM FOREIGN SOURCES- WITHOUT COMPLYING WITH APPLICABLE STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS AND THIS IS ALSO- A VIOLATION OF- THE- PACKED ACT WHICH IS A FEDERAL STATUTE THAT REGULATES THE DELIVERY OF CIGARETTES- IN THE CALIFORNIA AND OTHER STATES WE ALSO TAKE IN ANY NUMBER OF ACTIONS AGAINST OTHER ENTITIES CIGARETTE MANUFACTURERS AND DISTRIBUTORS. THAT HAVE SOLD ILLEGAL CIGARETTES IN OURS OUR PUBLIC WEBSITE HAS QUITE A BIT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS THAT WE HAVE- FILED AND THE RESULTS AND I'D BE HAPPY TO GIVE YOU A LINK TO IT IF YOU LIKE. SO MOST WAS A BLACK MARKET ISSUE THEN CORRECT. YEAH PROBLEMS THEY THEY ARE- THEY ARE. OFF DIRECTORY CIGARETTES THAT ARE UNLAWFUL FOR SALE IN THE STATE SO I GUESS MY CONCERN IS RIGHT NOW REVENUE A BIG PROBLEM WITH VAPING- BOTH THE BLACK MARKET. THERE REALLY HASN'T BEEN SIGNIFICANT IMPACT MADE BY LAW ENFORCEMENT- TO THAT MARKET YET SO YOU'VE GOT YOU COMPETING WITH THAT SO I MEAN. WE KNOW THAT YOU HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES THAN THEY DID AWAY WITH BEANIE SO- I'M JUST TRY TO FIGURE OUT. GOING FORWARD WHAT IS A PLANT MAGES OFFICE TO DEAL WITH THAT. KNOWING THAT YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE- VAPING BLACK MARKET ALSO WELL WE ARE CERTAINLY CONCERNED ABOUT ILLEGAL SALES OF- LIKE TRONIC CIGARETTES AS WELL- THERE WAS I THINK A FAIR AMOUNTOF PUBLICITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S DECISION TO SUE JEWEL. FOR A VARIETY OF- VIOLATIONS OF STATE LAW WE DID THAT IN NOVEMBER WE ARE ALWAYS. TRIED IN AN EFFICIENT WAY TO- ENFORCE THE APPLICABLE LAWS AGAINST ALL TOBACCO PRODUCTS BUT ON THE VAPING ISSUES MOST OF IT IS NOT COMING FROM JEWEL BLACK MARKET. CANNABIS ANOTHER BLACK MARKET PRODUCTS THAT'S THAT'S THE CRUX OF THE PROBLEM CORRECT. WELL WE SOON ACTUAL BECAUSE WE HAVE A GOOD FAITH BELIEF THAT JEWEL HAS OPERATED OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH A NUMBER OF CALIFORNIA LAWS THAT SAID THERE CERTAINLY ARE OTHER ENTITIES THAT ARE SELLING. TOBACCO PRODUCTS INCLUDING VAPING PRODUCTS- WITHOUT FULLY COMPLIED WITH CALIFORNIA LAW AND WE CONTINUE TO LOOK INTO ALL THAT ACTIVITY. MY HOPE IS THAT WE JUST TO DO A BETTER JOB OBVIOUSLY THE AG'S OFFICE HAS A LOT OF BALLS IN THEIR LOT TO JUGGLE AND THE LOCALS THERE DOWN TO GROUND LEVEL THEY KNOW THAT THEIR THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS MISS FOSTER DOING SAID LEAD TO SEE MORE PUSH DOWN IT REALLY TIRESOME THESE FOLKS. THAT ARE MAKING A LOT OF MONEY OFF THESE. THE BLACK MARKET CIGARETTES RIGHT AND IT REALLY HIT WITH ASSET FORFEITURE. AS IS THE EIGHTY THOUGHT ABOUT REALLY. DOING THAT ARE GOING AFTER HIM THE SUBSTANTIAL WAY BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THE FINES ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT CERTAINLY- UNDERS SOME LAWS- ASSET THAT SEIZURE OF CIGARETTES AND FORFEITURE OF CIGARETTES IS PERMISSIBLE THOSE THAT ARE SOLD WITHOUT- BEING ON OUR STATE TOBACCO DIRECTORY- TARA TALKING THEIR MONEY ANOTHER CIGARETTES PARDON I'M TALKING THEIR MONEY. THE PROBLEMS THEY MAKE- YEAH YOU CAN YOU SEE THE CIGARETTE THREE LEGAL TALK ABOUT ASSET FORFEITURE SEASON THEIR MONEY IN IN PROPERTY. WELL WHAT I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK INTO THAT TO ASCERTAIN- THE- APPLICABLE LAWS THAT WOULD GIVE US THE AUTHORITY TO GO AGAINST ASSETS FATHER THEY ON THE CIGARETTES THEMSELVES. IF I MAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER I THINK YOU KNOW WERE APPRECIATIVE OF THIS CONTINUING DISCUSSION WERE OBVIOUSLY EXPLORING ALL OF THESE VARIOUS AVENUES THAT WE CAN- IN IN THIS FIGHT AGAINST- IN BLACK MARKET OF CIGARETTES IN VAPING I'M I THINK WITH RESPECT TO THIS BILL. TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION ABOUT BAND WITH WE ACTUALLY THINK THAT THIS WOULD HELP STREAMLINE SOME OF THE- BOTH THE EFFORTS IN THE- AND THE SUBMISSIONS RIGHT NOW TO MAKE THIS ACTUALLY EASIER FOR THE AG TO ENFORCE. AT THE END OF THE DAY A LOT OF IT ON THE IN THE TO DEATH BUT YOU ONLY HAVE SO MUCH CAPACITY. IS THE IT IS OFFICE. SO WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT THE VAPING ISSUE. FOR THE BLACK MARKET CIGARETTES AND ONCE AGAIN YOU HAVE ONLY SO MANY AGENTS. THEY CAN GO OUT OF FORCE THESE LAWS AND DEAL WITH THIS SO. I JUST YOU CAN'T DO IT. WELL WHAT WE BELIEVE THIS ILL ACTUALLY HELP STREAMLINE ALL OF THAT AND ULTIMATELY. IF. OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS MEMBERS. MR GALLAGHER LOOKS LIKE HE HAS A BRIEF QUESTION. YOUNG MY CAN MY CONCERN IS I MEAN CERTAINLY IS A GOOD PROGRAM- BUT I DON'T KNOW THERE'S BEEN A SUFFICIENT JUSTIFICATION FOR MOVING IT FROM THE FIRE MARSHALL TO THE AG'S OFFICE. AND LOOKED QUITE FRANKLY THE AG'S OFFICE IS HAVING A TROUBLE DOING THE THINGS THAT IS ALREADY TASKED WITH DOING PRIMARILY GETTING GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF FELONS AND OTHER PROHIBITED PERSONS. IS STILL WAY BEHIND ON THAT AND I WOULD MUCH RATHER SEE THEIR ATTENTION FOCUSED ON THE IMPORTANT ITEMS THAT HAS BEEN TASKED WITH AS OF TODAY RATHER THAN ADDING A PROGRAM AND I THINK IS- ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER IS POINTED OUT. THERE'S STILL A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT NEED TO BE. I THINK FULLY FLESHED OUT BEFORE WE JUST HAND OVER- THIS PROGRAM I MEAN THERE IS THE- BLACK MARKET THE NO CANNABIS AS WELL WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE ENFORCEMENT OF THOSE THINGS- I THINK THE DISCUSSION ABOUT ASSETS ASSET FORFEITURE IS A GOOD ONE- AND SHOULD MAYBE BE PART OF THIS AS WELL- SO I DON'T I DON'T KNOW THAT I'M READY TO JUST. SAY YEAH LET'S GO AHEAD AND HAND OVER THIS PROGRAM WHEN AGAIN I DON'T THINK THERE'S BEEN THE SUFFICIENT SUFFICIENT JUSTIFICATION OR YOU KNOW THE BACKGROUND. AS TO HOW THIS COULD ALL WORK VERY COMPREHENSIVELY- IN THE AG'S OFFICE. APPARENTLY MR GARGAN I HAVE DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS OF BRIEF. MR BIGELOW. AND SO MISTER CHAIRMAN IF I CAN REALLY BRIEFLY- HAVE REALLY BRIEFLY I YOU KNOW I THINK ONE THING THAT'S BEEN OVERLOOKED IS- WITH THIS BILL- ME- I APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS ABOUT EFFICIENCIES- BUT CERTAINLY MODERNIZATION IS SOMETHING THAT I CARE ABOUT AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CURRENT PROCESS THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL HAS A PAPER FORM AND MANUALLY ENTERS MOST OF THIS DATA TO A SPREADSHEET AND SO THE IDEA BEHIND THIS IS THAT WHEN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SHOULD ASSUME THIS RESPONSIBILITY. AND ADMINISTER THIS PROGRAM THEY WILL USE AN ELECTRONIC FORM- AND SO IN THE LONG TERM WE CAN BE CREATING IT IN EFFICIENCY- THAT IS GOING TO BE A HUGE BENEFIT FOR THIS ENTIRE PROCESS FOR STATE FOR TAXPAYERS- AND SO NAY APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS BUT I THINK THAT THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. WELL WE ALSO GOT A WORK ON BIRD MISTER BAILEY. THANK YOU MY QUESTIONS MAYBE FOR THE AG'S OFFICE AND A KIND OF TRAILS AND WHAT'S BEING DISCUSSED HERE CLEARLY IN YOUR- BACK UP THE INFORMATION AS THE SPONSOR OF THIS THAT YOU PRESENTED TO US AND WE HAVE. A COPY OF YOU YOU SHOW IN THERE THAT THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL'S OFFICE HAS BEEN UNABLE TO REALLY PERFORM DOING THIS BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF FUNDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS YOU ALSO IN RECENT YEARS HAVE SHOWN THAT THE FIRE MARSHAL HAS DECLINED TO REVIEW A NUMBER THE CERTIFICATIONS BECAUSE OF THAT LACK OF FUNDING. YOU'RE STEPPING UP AND SAYING YOU WANT TO TAKE THIS ON BUT YET YOU'RE NOT ASKING FOR ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDS AND USE HEARD FROM SEVERAL MEMBERS THE FACT THAT YOU'RE SOMEWHAT OVERLOOKED LOADED AT YOURSELVES. AND I GET THE AUTHORS- COMMENT ABOUT MAYBE SOME EFFICIENCIES EXIST. WHICH BEGS ONTO A LARGER DISCUSSION SOME OF THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS DON'T HAVE THE SAME BREATH OF- FUNDING THAT YOU DO- FOR THE- ENHANCED- TOOLS THAT NEED TO EXIST THROUGHOUT OUR IN STATE SYSTEM. BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO HANDLE IS. WITHOUT ASKING FOR MORE FUNDS. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION THAT'S A VERY VALID QUESTION FIRST OF ALL THE TO TURNING GENERAL'S OFFICE AND MORE SPECIFICALLY THE TOBACCO SECTION WITHIN THE TOURNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE ALREADY REVIEWS THESE MATERIALS AS PART OF HIS ONGOING UNFORCED MEANT AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE STATE TOBACCO DIRECTORY SO- IT REALLY IS NOT GOING TO BE ADDING TO OUR EXISTING WORKLOAD- BUT IT MAKES FOR A MORE EFFICIENT SYSTEM. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE TO ASK THE MANUFACTURERS TO SEND US WHAT THEY'VE SENT OVER EXTRA COPIES SENT OVER TO THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL'S OFFICE AND- FRANKLY THE- THANKS TO THE VOTERS IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN- PROP FIFTY SIX DOES GIVE- THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FUNDING FOR A NUMBER OF TOBACCO RELATED- WORK INCLUDING THIS TYPE OF WORK AND THERE IS NO CONFLICT OF INTEREST FOR YOU WITH RESPECT AND NOW YOU'RE PLAYING A MULTIPLE ROLL PART WITH RESPECT TO. THIS ENTIRE REQUEST. FOR EXAMPLE YOUR SAID JUDGE JURY AND EXECUTIONER IN A SENSE- WITH RESPECT TO THAT AS THE EIGHT GB. I DON'T I DON'T VIEW TAKING ON THE ROLE OF BOTH AN ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTION AND ENFORCEMENT AS APPROPRIATE AS BEING A CONFLICT OF INTEREST THAT IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT IS DONE IN MANY OTHER AREAS INCLUDING OUR TOBACCO DIRECTORY. OKAY. HI I APPRECIATE THAT AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE SENATORS CAME. THIS MORNING. ANY OTHER A QUESTIONS MEMBERS. SEEING NONE ALL JUST ADD REAL QUICKLY MR BIGELOW AYE CURVE THE CURRENTS WE SAW A SIMILAR SITUATION WITH THE WATER BOARD- WHERE WE HAD- WHAT I WOULD DEFINE AS CONFLICT OF INTEREST EVEN IF THE AGENCY FOLKS DON'T ALWAYS SEE IT AS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST. SO IT CERTAINLY IS A CONCERN AND LEGITIMATE ONE. I THINK IT ALSO MISTER IF I COULD JUST I THINK IT BEARS. ADDITIONAL REVIEW BY AS AN MAYBE IT BEGS THE QUESTION IS SHOULD SOMEHOW WE POLICE BACK FOR REVIEW AFTER A PERIOD OF TIME TO SEE IF IT'S REALLY WORKING TO ITS- INTENDED WAY. I'M SURE THEY OPEN TO THAT AND- FOLLOW UP WITH YOU OKAY THANK YOU. OKAY ANY OTHER ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS SEEING NONE. WE HAVE A MOTION A SECOND TRACTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.
