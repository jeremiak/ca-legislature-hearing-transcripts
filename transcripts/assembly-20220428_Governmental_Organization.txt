UNDER EXISTING LAW CANNABIS RETAILERS CAN BE ISSUED STATE TEMPORARY EVENT LICENSES THAT ALLOW FOR ON SITE CANNABIS SALES CONSUMPTION WITHIN WITHIN A LIMITED SET OF VENUES. AND UNDER SPECIFIC RESTRICTIONS BY THE STATE. HOWEVER THESE LICENSES DO NOT CURRENTLY COVER SITUATIONS IN WHICH AN EVENT HOST PRE PAYS FOR CANNABIS AND CANNABIS PRODUCTS TO BE PROVIDED FREE OF CHARGE EVENT GAS. I BY CREATING THESE HEARING LICENSES AB TWENTY EIGHT FORTY FOUR WILL CREATE A REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT TO HELP INSURE THERE'S GREATER SAFETY AND OVERSIGHT OF CANNABIS CONSUMPTION AT GATHERINGS SUCH AS WELL WEDDINGS AND WELLNESS RETREATS.

ASPECT ON THAT WE SEE A LOT OF KIDS GOOD OLD CANNABIS LATELY SO HOW DO WE- ARE WE SURE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN WITH THE- BACKDROP ON THAT THIS REGIONAL QUESTION- OUR OFFICE EXCEPT AMENDMENTS AND BMP COMMITTEE THATALIGN THIS BILL WITH. EXISTING LAWS RELATED TO ALCOHOL CATERING CANNABIS CONSUMPTION LOUNGES. ONE OF THESE AMENDMENTS CLARIFY THAT RESTRICT UNDERAGE CONSUMPTION OF CANNABIS. AND PROVIDE THAT ALL CONSUMPTION PRIVATE AND SHOULD BE SEPARATE. AND HIDDEN FROM UNDERAGE GASES BUILD REQUIRE. CANNABIS CONSUMPTION INDICATOR PRIVATE EVENT OCCUR IN A RESTRICTED AREA. THE COMPLIES THE SAME AGE RESTRICTIONS AS CONSUMPTION CONSUMPTION LOUNGES AND LICENSE TEMPORARY EVENTS- AND FOR THE MORE BY CREATING THIS LICENSE BE SURE THAT. THAT THAT THERE CAN BE A CATER PRESENT A CANNABIS PRODUCTS ARE LIKE CLEARLY LABELED AS CANNABIS. AND THE DOSAGE INFORMATION THAT COULD BE NO MISTAKING THE PRODUCT- THIS CREATES A SAFER ENVIRONMENT IS MUCH MORE REGULATORS OPPOSE WHAT IS CURRENTLY HAPPENING WHERE FOLKS ARE.

WE HAVE A NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT AT THIS TIME THANK YOU WE HAD AN INTENT TO DO A FIRST IN THE SECOND EARLIER NEEDED TO RECEIVE THEM NOW I CAN'T REMEMBER THAT. MISTER LOW AND- MR DAILY. YES IN IT BUT THIS IS JUST A QUESTION WILL BE REQUIRED TO CONSUME CANNABIS IN THAT RESTRICTED AREA OR THE CONNECTICUT WITH MINGLE. OUT THE- IN THAT AREA. YEAH IT'S SIMILAR TO- OTHER TYPE ABOUT WE ARE BASING PATTERN AND FRANKLY REALLY APPRECIATE BOTH THE BNP COMMITTEE AS WELL AS THIS COMMITTEE A CONSULTANTS FOR CHEAPER FOR MAKING A LANGUAGE MUCH MORE CLEAR BUT IT REQUIRED CANNABIS CONSUMPTION ALLOCATOR PRIVATE EVENT TO OCCUR IN A RESTRICTED AREA THE COMPLIES THE SAME AGE RESTRICTIONS OF CONSUMPTION LOUNGES A LICENSE TEMPORARY EVENTS SO WE'RE ALIGNING IT WITH OTHER. TYPES OF SIMILAR TYPE CONTENT BUT IT DOES HAVE TO BE CONSUMED IN THAT AREA. BUT WHAT WHAT I WONDER IS FOR INSTANCE IF YOU HAVE IT AN INDOOR AREA WHERE THEY'RE DOING IT. AND THEN THEY'RE SELLING- FLOWER- YOU KNOW THE ACTUAL CANNABIS ITSELF. AND THEY'VE SB SMOKED. BECAUSE HE CANCELED INDOORS. HOW'S THAT DONE YOU HAVE TO SEPARATE THE SMOKING AREA. THE AREA WHERE IT'S GIVEN TO THE- INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE HOW DO YOU. RECONCILE THAT WHAT THE RESTRICTED AREA. REGARDLESS THE SOFT COMPLY WITH OUR INDOOR SMOKING WILL ALSO THEY HAVE AN OUTDOOR AREA THAT THEY CAN CREATE INTEREST ACTED AREA. THAT'S FINE IT IS INDOORS OR TO HAVE TO BE EMBEDDABLE OR OTHERS OTHER FORM OTHER THAN SMOKE. SURE SUCH I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT IS NOT WHERE. THEY'RE THEY'RE SERVED INDOORS. AND THEN OKAY GOT SMOKELESS. IN THE OUTDOORS BUT IS NOT MONITORED YEAH THAT COULD THAT COULD HAPPEN TO I MEAN COULD THEY COULD DESIGNATE AREA. FOR SMOKING BUT IS NOT MONITORED AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO. IT I WOULD SUGGEST TO HAVE SOMEONE IN THAT AREA TO MONITOR IT. THE BOTH AREAS THE SENATE. WELL I. IF I IF I COULD MISS RICHARD IDEAS THAT IF IT'S- IF THEY HAVE AN OUTDOOR AREA THAT IS THE WAS THE RESTRICTED AREA IT WOULD HAVE TO BE CONSUMED IN THAT AREA- IF IT'S AN INDOOR AREA IT WOULD HAVE TO BE EDIBLE OR SOMETIME BEFORE THE DOESN'T HAVE SMOKE- BUT TO YOUR POINT YOU KNOW IT IT JUST LIKE ANY OTHER. SMOKING OR SMOKING LAWS WILL HAVE TO BE ABIDED BY IN THIS CASE. FOR THIS CONSUMPTION AT AN EVENT WOULD HAVE TO HAPPEN IN A RESTRICTED AREA. IF THERE IS NOT AN OUTDOOR RESTRICTED AREA THEN IT WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED. THE SMOKE. THE SMOKING OF THE FORM OF- CONSUMPTION. OKAY THANK YOU.
