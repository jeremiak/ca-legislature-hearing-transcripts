BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER ONE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR PARTICIPATING IN TODAY'S HEARING. TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING AN EXCITING TRANSITION BEING OFFERED A PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR TO IMPROVE OUR SERVICES. IN YOUTH RESTORATION. THEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS ACROSS THE AUTOMATION PROJECTS THAT ENABLE MAJOR PUBLIC BENEFIT PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA. BEFORE WE DO THOSE HOWEVER WE WILL BE TAKING ISSUE ITEM NUMBER ELEVEN OUT OF ORDER. THAT WILL BE THE SECOND ITEM WE WILL BE -- HEARING BEFORE WE GO ON TO THE OTHER SYSTEMS INTEGRATION PROGRAMS. AND IS ALWAYS TO KEEP THE CONVERSATION GOING MOVING FORWARD DURING OUR LIMITED TIME TOGETHER. WE DO ASK ALL PANEL IS TO BE SUCCINCT IN THE PRESENTATIONS AND TO LIMIT THEIR COMMENTS TO UNDER THREE MINUTES. AND DURING PUBLIC COMMENT WE DO ASK THAT PUBLIC COMMENT BE LIMITED TO ONE MINUTE. WITH THAT LET'S BEGIN WITH ISSUE NUMBER -- ONE I WANT TO WELCOME. FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. CHUCK SUPPLE DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND CHRIS CAN'T FROM THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES TO DISCUSS THE CREATION OF A NEW. DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION WITHIN. THE HHS AGENCY. HI. PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS IT'S A PLEASURE AND HONOR TO BE HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL. TO MOVE DJJ. INTO A NEW DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION. AT CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. AND WE VIEW THIS AS A CRITICAL STEP ON THE JOURNEY OF STRENGTHENING DJJ IS ABILITY TO FULFILL OUR VISION AND MISSION. UTILIZING SOME KEY STRATEGIES AND I JUST WANTED TO HIT ON A LITTLE BIT OF A HISTORY. WITH BACK IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES THE THE HEIGHT OF CALIFORNIA THE THIRTIES POPULATION THERE WERE SOME THIRTEEN THOUSAND YOUTH. WHO ARE IN EIGHT DJJ FACILITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND FIVE FIRE CAMPS AND TODAY THERE ARE THREE FACILITIES? AND ONE FIRE CAMP AND TODAY I THINK SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWO YOUTH WHO ARE IN THOSE FACILITIES AND FIRE CAMP. SO THAT THERE HAS BEEN A DRAMATIC -- DEVOLUTION SO TO SPEAK OF THE POPULATION OF YOUTH THAT ARE IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS CERTAINLY. WITHIN THE STATE'S DEEP AND IF YOU WILL -- PORTION OF THE SYSTEM AND THAT HAS BEEN A RESULT OF A NUMBER OF REFORMS LEGISLATIVE -- OVER THE YEARS POLICY INITIATIVES -- AS WELL AS A DECREASE IN JUVENILE CRIME JUVENILE ARRESTS. HOWEVER WITH THAT LEAVES DJJ WITH -- IS THE STATE'S MOST SIGNIFICANTLY BEHAVIOR EARLY -- AND MENTALLY CHALLENGED YOUTH. WE HAVE COME OUT OF A FEDERAL LAWSUIT -- SUCCESSFULLY THREE YEARS AGO AND HAVE MANY OF THE TOOLS AND STRATEGIES THAT ARE NECESSARY TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THIS POPULATION. BUT MORE WORK REMAINS TO BE DONE AND THE THREE KEY STEPS BEFORE US ONE IS. TO A SUSTAIN AND ADVANCE THE GAINS OF THE FERAL LAWSUIT PARTICULARLY THE CONTINUED. IMPLEMENTATION OF WHAT WE CALL THE INTEGRATED BEHAVIOR TREATMENT MODEL WHICH IS A WHOLE ARRAY OF EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENT -- IT TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF THE YOUTH THAT WE ARE LEFT TO SERVE. AND TO CONTINUE TO CULTIVATE A A CULTURE THAT IS SUPPORTIVE OF THAT THAT SUPPORTS THE THE MISSION AND I SEE THAT AS A CULTURE. OF SUCCESS AND FINALLY. TO BUILD UP WHAT I CALL THE STRENGTH BASED SPACE OBVIOUSLY A CRITICAL PORTION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE. AND ADDRESSING THE POPULATION THAT WE ARE ENTRUSTED TO SERVICE TO HELP THEM TO BE ABLE TO REDUCE THEIR RISK TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS. THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE CONDITIONS THE PAST EXPERIENCES THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THEIR DANGEROUS BEHAVIOR. BUT A BIG PART OF IT AS WELL AS HELPING THEM TO BUILD UPON THEIR STRENGTHS TO BE ABLE TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM TO IMAGINE THE POSSIBILITY OF A DIFFERENT IDENTITY FOR THEMSELVES AS WELL AS TO PURSUE -- YOU KNOW PASSIONS -- IN A DIFFERENT FUTURE ORIENTATION TO GET A NEW LIFE SO TO SPEAK TO BE ABLE TO RETURN SAFELY TO THE COMMUNITY BECOME RESPONSIBLE SUCCESSFUL ADULTS. AND AT THIS PARTICULAR PART OF IT THIS PARTICULAR TIME INDEED JJ'S JOURNEY THE TRANSITION TO CALIFORNIA'S DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES WILL HELP US TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER ON THAT MISSION THROUGH DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE LANDS TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT WITH. RESOURCES THAT ARE CRITICAL BOTH IN TERMS OF OUR OWN DELIVERY OF SERVICE AS WELL AS SERVICES THEY'RE GETTING PORT. FOR THE TRANSITION OF THE YOUTH BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY. FAULT LEAVE IT AT THAT HOPEFULLY THAT WAS THREE MINUTES AND CERTAINLY CAN ANSWER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AS WE GO ALONG THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND JUST LIKE. TO REITERATE THAT YOU KNOW WE REALLY SEE THIS IS OPPORTUNITY GROW ON THE PROGRESS THAT'S BEEN MADE AT DJJ YOU KNOW THE HEALTH HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES WE FOCUSED ON REHABILITATION INTEGRATION AND PERSON CENTEREDNESS AND THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE HAVE SEEN DEVELOP A DJJ. AND WE THINK WE'LL FOSTER AND GROW WITH HIM SERVICE AGENCY BOTH IN THE LARGER MISSION AND HELPING TO CONNECT -- DJJ TO LOCAL ENTITIES UNDER OUR PURVIEW SUCH AS HOLES SERVICES AND MEDI CAL. SO DOES REINFORCE THAT POINT NOW KEEP IT SHORT. ORTEGA'S GIVING A VERY SHORT. THANK YOU -- NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. ERIN EDWARDS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ADDITIONAL TO ADD -- TO WITH MISTER -- SUPPLE MISTER KENT NOTED BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE NEXT WITNESS. LEAKAGE MORROW WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE IN CONCERN THIS PROPOSAL WE IDENTIFIED A FEW QUESTIONS THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER. THE FIRST OF WHICH WOULD BE WHETHER OR NOT TO DJ. NEEDS TO BE REORGANIZED TO IMPROVE REHABILITATION. AS MENTIONED THE IN TWO THOUSAND THREE DJ ENTERED INTO THE FEDERAL LAWSUIT CONTENDS THAT HAS TAKEN SEVERAL STEPS TO IMPROVE REHABILITATION EFFORTS. THEY EXITED THIS LAWSUIT IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN HOWEVER THE MOST RECENT REHABILITATION AND CITIZEN DATA WE HAVE TO RE CONVICTION RATES -- FORTY MORE TO HAVE LEFT DJ IT'S FOR THE CODE THAT. LEFT IN 200-011-2000 TWELVE SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE THAT LAWSUIT ENDED AND SEVERAL YEARS FROM CURRENT STATE. SO IT'S NOT CLEAR HOW EFFECTIVE THE CURRENT PROGRAMS IN. DE TODAY ARE AT REHABILITATING YOUTH. IN ADDITION WE WOULD WANT TO CONSIDER ONE OF THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF ITS REORGANIZATION. THE ADMINISTRATION HAS MENTIONED SEVERAL POTENTIAL BENEFITS HOWEVER IT'S NOT GOING TO CLEAR HOW THESE BENEFITS WOULD BE OPERATIONALIZED. AND THE NEXT QUESTION WOULD BE ONE OF THE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES OF THIS REORGANIZATION. WITHOUT KNOWING HOW THE CAN OPERATIONALIZE THESE BENEFITS IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT THAT WOULD BE IMPROVEMENTS TO REHABILITATION. IN ADDITION IT COULD LEAD TO INCREASED COSTS STUDENT THE NEED TO DUPLICATE. EFFORTS ARE CURRENTLY SHARED WITH YOU SEE OUR ON THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. AND THAT NO COULD ALSO BE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES SUCH AS COMPLICATING THE COORDINATION BETWEEN. DJJ NCDC ARW. IN ADDITION TO THAT WE WANT TO CONSIDER WHETHER THE ALTERNATIVE ORGANIZATIONAL OPTIONS AVAILABLE. WE LOOKED AT HOW OTHER STATES HAVE ORGANIZED -- JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEMS. AND WHILE MANY STATES HAVE HAD THE OUR JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEMS UNDER THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. SINCE NINETEEN NINETY THREE ABOUT HALF THE STATES WHO HAD THIS MODEL HAVE MOVED AWAY FROM IT TO MOVE THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM PRIMARILY INTO EITHER ONE INDEPENDENT DEPARTMENT THAT'S NOT UNDER AN AGENCY. OR INTO -- AGENCY THAT SPECIFIC TO YOUTH AND FAMILY -- IN ADDITION ANOTHER OPTION WOULD BE TO POTENTIALLY REALIGN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM COMPLETELY TO THE COUNTIES. CURRENTLY ABOUT 13% OF THE YOUTH WHO ARE IN -- CORRECTIONAL FACILITY IN CALIFORNIA OUR HOUSE IN THE STATE IN DJ THEIR MAIN OUR HOUSE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. AND IN ADDITION BOTH THE STATE FACILITIES AND COUNTY FACILITIES ARE. GENERALLY OUT ABOUT A THIRD OF THE TOTAL CAPACITY. REALIGNING THE YOUTH TO THE COUNTY LEVEL. COULD HAVE THE BENEFIT OF COST SAVINGS BOTH FOR THE STATE AND THE COUNTIES AS WELL AS GET PUT IN THE YOUTH CLOSER TO THOSE. SUPPORT SERVICES SUCH AS A FAMILY -- ANOTHER. QUESTION WE WANT TO RAISE IS WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE USE OF BUDGET TRAVEL LEGISLATION. THAT PRIMARY REORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE THE PREVIOUS REALIZATIONS OF DJ THAT HAPPENED HAVE A COURT THROUGH -- EXECUTIVE REORGANIZATION PROCESS AT THAT SALAS BY STATUTE IT'S NOT CLEAR WHY THIS REORGANIZATION SHOULD GO THROUGH TRAILER BILL LEGISLATION INSTEAD -- SENSE THE TIME OF THIS ANALYSIS THE ADMINISTRATION HAS RELEASED TRAILER BILL LEGISLATION. IN REVIEWING THAT PLEDGE THE TRAILER BILL WE HAVE. IDENTIFIED A FEW QUESTIONS THAT WE SENT OVER TO DEAL OUT -- FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION -- SOME OF THE CONCERNS OR ISSUES THAT WE HAVE SEEK ADDITIONAL COMPLICATION FOR INCLUDE -- THE PERSONNEL ADJUSTMENTS I WOULD BE NECESSARY TO MAKE THIS ORGANIZED REALIZATION HAPPENED THE TRAINING PROGRAM THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY BE ESTABLISHED FOR THESE PERSONNEL ON WHETHER TO APPLY TO ALL PERSONNEL ONLY NEW PERSONNEL. WHAT WHY THE THE TRAILER BILL IN THE REPORT INCLUDES LANGUAGE REGARDING? WHY REGULATIONS NEED TO BE WHY THE? REGULATORY PROCESS WOULD BE BYPASS IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS -- FOR THE NEW DEPARTMENT. AS WELL AS A POTENTIAL NEW PROGRAM WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS THAT WE HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY SEEN [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT LET'S OPEN IT UP TO PUBLIC COMMENT. GOOD AFTERNOON HAVE MARK FILL PART WITH POLICY LINK AND THE ALLIED SUPPORT SOME OF COLOR -- WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH A COALITION OF LEADERS -- THE TEN BY TEN COALITION THE CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE FOR YOU THINK COMMUNITY JUSTICE. AND A WHOLE HOST OF YOUTH ADVOCATES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I HOPE WE ALL SUPPORT THIS TRANSITION -- BUT WE ALL BELIEVE THAT -- IT SHOULD BE DONE IN A WAY THAT WORKS TOWARDS CLOSURE -- WE BELIEVE THAT -- EXPERTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY ARE FOCUSED ON THIS IDEA OF CLOSING YOUTH PRISONS AND THAT THAT IS -- A NATIONALLY. RECOGNIZED APPROACH -- AND SO WE'RE LOOKING. TO HAVE THIS TRANSITION SUPPORT THAT GOAL -- AND THINKING ABOUT THE SHRINKAGE OF THE POPULATION IN A OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS ALL OF THE RACIAL DISPARITIES THAT EXIST WITHIN IT. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU. NATASHA MINSKER ON BEHALF OF THE ELLA BAKER CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. WE SUPPORT MOVING DJJ INTO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES WE ALSO SUPPORT THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION OF A TASK FORCE TO GUIDE THE MOVE IN TO BEGIN DEVELOPING A BROADER VISION FOR TRANSFORMING. CALIFORNIA'S JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM THE TEN BY TEN COALITION HAS SUBMITTED PROPOSED AMENDMENTS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THOSE AMENDMENTS AND BELIEVE THAT THEY WILL. ENSURE THAT THE MOVE A SUCCESSFUL FINALLY WE BELIEVE THAT IN ORDER FOR THE MOVE TO BE SUCCESSFUL WE DO BELIEVE IT IS CRITICAL TO STOP THE POPULATION GROWTH RIGHT NOW. WE THINK IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE WHILE WE ARE IN THIS PERIOD OF TRANSITION GOING FROM ONE SYSTEM TO ANOTHER TO CONTINUE TO ALLOW THE POPULATION AT DJJ TO GROW. AND CONTINUE TO HIRE STAFF IN TO THE OLD SYSTEM WHEN WE ARE IN THE TRYING TO TRANSITION THE CULTURE AND MOVED TO A NEW SYSTEM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HELEN ROTH. THOUSAND SEIU LOCAL ONE THOUSAND WE REPRESENT TEACHERS AND HEALTH PERSONNEL WITHIN DJJ. A WE'RE NOT OPPOSING THIS WE WE THINK THOUGH THAT WORK WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS ONE IS THAT RECENTLY -- WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING IS THEY'VE BEEN TAKING PEOPLE WERE UNDER AGE TWENTY FIVE AND PUTTING THEM BACK IN THE DJJ FROM THE DEPARTMENT FROM THE ADULT PRISONS. IN THIS COORDINATION HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL OTHERWISE -- WHAT WAS HAPPENING BEFORE DURING -- SCHWARZENEGGER'S TIME FOR EXAMPLE IS MORE OF A WHEN YOU REACH YOUR EIGHTEENTH BIRTHDAY YOU ARE SENT OFF TO PRISON EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE LIKE WITHIN A MONTH OF OF GRADUATION FROM HIGH SCHOOL. ON IN THERE NO HIGH SCHOOL SINCE IN THE BIG CDC ARE BUT THEY ARE YOU CAN GET A HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE ACTUALLY WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE. IS THAT -- THERE ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED PRISONERS WHO ARE BETWEEN THE AGES OF TWENTY FIVE IN EIGHTEEN THAT WE TRANSFER THEM BACK IN TO DJJ WHICH HAS OTHER SORTS OF MUCH LARGER RESOURCES FOR EXAMPLE. THEY HAVE ON CHILDREN THEY HAD TEACHERS THAT CAN WORK WITH KIDS WHO HAVE LEARNING DISABILITIES WHICH THEY DON'T HAVE. IN IT IN THE LARGER FACILITY IN ABOUT 30% OF AB IF NOT MORE HAVE THESE PROBLEMS SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE ALSO A CLOSING THIS FACILITY YOU HAVE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR EXAMPLE. YOU HAVE KIDS THAT ARE THERE BECAUSE THEY'VE THEY'VE BEEN THE CARD THEIR CRIME A SEX ABUSE IT CAUSES THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR PROGRAM IT'S BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL YOU CAN EXPECT ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES TO BE ABLE TO REPLICATE THAT PROGRAM. THERE'S AN ECONOMY OF SCALE IN A STATE WITH FORTY MILLION PEOPLE WHERE YOU NEED A FACILITY LIKE DJJ THAT CAN DO THE SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS. IN SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN VERY VERY SUCCESSFUL SO WITH THAT AND THOSE ARE OUR COMMENTS AND WE URGE THOSE. COMMENTS BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION THANK YOU THANK YOU. HEY GOOD AFTERNOON MORNING WASHBURN WITH THE CENTER ON AND WE'RE HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSAL TO MOVE DJJ INTO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. BUT WITH CONCERN THAT -- A NAME CHANGE ALONE WILL NOT. FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE DAILY LIFE FOR YOU FROM THE INSTITUTIONS. AND WE RECENTLY RELEASED A REPORT LOOKING AT CURRENT CONDITIONS AT DJJ AND FOUND THAT THEY REMAIN UNSAFE AND FUNDAMENTALLY NON REHABILITATIVE. AND THAT'S DUE TO FACTORS THAT ARE REALLY ENDEMIC TO CONGREGATE INSTITUTIONS THE FACT THAT THERE. REMOTE THEIR PRISON LIKE -- AND THEIR LARGE SCALE AND SO WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION FOR TASK FORCE TO GUIDE THIS TRANSITION. WE'D ALSO LIKE TO SEE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES A SEARCH GREATER OVERSIGHT OVER DJJ AND ULTIMATELY MOVE TOWARDS CLOSURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON SUPER RAIL AND I'M WITH THE PACIFIC JUVENILE DEFENDER CENTER WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE TEN BY TEN WORKING GROUP AND WORKED ON THE LANGUAGE THAT WERE SUBMITTING -- DID TO FOR INCLUSION IN PROPOSED INCLUSION IN THE TRAILER BILL WE SUPPORT THE MOVE OF H. OF DJ TO HHS BUT WE ALSO AS OTHERS HAVE SAID. I THINK THAT IT'SONLY A PART OF THE PICTURE WE SUPPORT THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION. FOR A TASK FORCE THAT WILL LOOK BOTH THAT THE TRANSITION OF DJJ ITSELF AND THE TRANSFORMATION OF DJJ INTO SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT THAN WE NOW HAVE IT IT SEEMS LIKE THE PERFECT TIME TO DO THAT. AND IT SEEMS LIKE IT WILL WORK VERY WELL IN HHS BUT WE ALSO THINK THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR A MUCH BIGGER POLICY PRESENCE AT THE STATE LEVEL THAN WE CURRENTLY HAVE ALL WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS A COMMITTEE WHICH I SERVE ON THE JUVENILE JUSTICE STANDING COMMITTEE. AT THE PSC SEE WHICH MEETS THREE OR FOUR TIMES A YEAR AND HAS NO STAFF NO RESOURCES EXCEPT THEY PAY FOR MY SANDWICH WHEN I GO THERE. AND WE THINK THAT THERE WE WE MUST BE ONE OF THE ONLY STATES THAT DOESN'T HAVE A STATE LEVEL POLICY AGENCY -- AND SINCE DJJ REALLY ONLY SERVES A SMALL PROPORTION OF THE YOUTH IN JUVENILE JUSTICE WE THINK THAT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNE TIME TO SET. PLANS INTO MOTION FOR SERVING THE BULK OF CHILDREN IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. I'M SURE MEMBERS TIFFANY RIGHT WITH THAT THE ARE YOU CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSAL AND WOULD JUST LIKE TO ECHO THE COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE -- WE BELIEVE THAT THERE SHOULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO DISCUSS THE TRANSITION AND KIND OF HOW IT TAKES PLACE -- THE STAKEHOLDER PROPOSED THAT STAKEHOLDER -- TASK FORCE WE WOULD ALSO AGREE WITH AND JUST ASK FEDERAL EMPLOYEE A CURRENT EMPLOYEE BE ON THAT TASK FORCE SO THAT THEY CAN ALSO ASSIST IN THE TRANSITION -- AND JUST ASK THAT THERE JUST BE A LITTLE BIT MORE THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATIONS -- WITH REGARD TO THIS PROPOSAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. DAPHNE DESIGN NATIONAL CENTER FOR YOUTH LAW WE ARE HERE IN SUPPORT AND WE ALSO SUPPORT THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION FOR TASK FORCE AND WOULD URGE THE THOUGHTFUL COMPOSITION OF THAT TASK FORCE ALSO INCLUDE. DIRECTLY IMPACTED YOUTH FAMILIES COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE WORKING WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE TRAINED AND TRAUMA. WE REALIZE THAT THIS IS THE START AND WE HOPE THAT THAT WILL BE AND THE ABILITY TO CONTINUE ON THIS MOMENTUM TO CONTINUE SERVING OUR YOUTH BETTER TO CUT BETTER CORDY THE SYSTEMS. AND TO CREATE BETTER OVERSIGHT THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON DANIEL SANCHEZ ON BEHALF OF THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA I'M HERE TODAY IN IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL -- TO MOVE THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE OUT OF THE ADULT CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM -- I I DO WANT TO REFLECT UPON KIND OF THE WHAT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MOVING -- DJJ AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT IS AN APPROACH THAT WE RECOGNIZE AND UNDERSTAND -- IT'S IT ALIGNS VERY MUCH ¢H HOW PROBATION DEPARTMENTS ARE STRUCTURED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- A SIMILARLY WHICH OPERATES DISTINCT FROM AT THE ADULT CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM SO IT'S CERTAINLY AN APPROACH THAT WE APPRECIATE UNDERSTAND AND BELIEVE THERE'S THERE TO BE BENEFITS -- TO I DO WANT TO TAKE JUST A MOMENT I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT -- TO REITERATE AND HIGHLIGHT THE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES OF PROBATION CHIEFS AND AND MANY OF OUR OUR STATE LOCAL PARTNERS. HAVE DONE SIGNIFICANT WORK TO REALLY LEAD AN EVOLUTION OF GETTING CALIFORNIA TO A PLACE WHERE WE HAVE THE LOWEST A JUVENILE ARREST RATES AND DETENTION RATES -- IN OUR HISTORY AND IT'S IT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK -- WE ALWAYS WANT TO LOOK TO HOW DO WE CONTINUE TO BUILD UPON THAT AND ENHANCE -- BUT IT IS IMPORTANT I THINK WHEN WE'RE THINKING ABOUT WHAT HIS CHANGE MEANS KIND OF IN THE CURRENT CONSTRUCT -- DOT SHE PROBATION OFFICERS AND COUNTY PROBATION APARTMENTS WORK VERY VERY CLOSELY WITH -- DJJ AND AND MISTER SUPPLE AND AND HIS TEAM -- ON THE RE ENTRY OF YOU COMING OUT OF STATE FACILITIES CURRENTLY COMING BACK TO THE COUNTIES IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND SO I THINK AS WORKS WERE THINKING ABOUT -- MOVING FORWARD ON THIS PROPOSAL IT'S IT'S VERY IMPORTANT -- TO THE CHIEFS THAT WE CONTINUE TO BUILD UPON THAT DIALOGUE KNOWING THAT THEY ARE COMING BACK TO OUR COMMUNITIES WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN AFFECTION WITH THIS CHANGE -- IN A WAY THAT PROTECTS PUBLIC SAFETY -- BUILDS UPON THE REHABILITATIVE GOALS IN ALL OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK THIS COMMITTEE IN THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE TO DO -- SO I WOULD JUST -- IN CLOSING SAY THAT WE AGAIN SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL A SEEDBOX CERTAINLY HOPES TO BE A PART OF THESE CONVERSE CONVERSATIONS AGAIN ABOUT HOW TO EFFECTUATE THIS AND ACHIEVE THE DESIRED GOALS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO BEING PART OF THAT CONVERSATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MENTOR MEMBERS COULD BE BECAUSE I'VE THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS -- I HEARD IN TESTIMONY EARLIER THAT. THE SEVEN HUNDRED OR SO REMAINING -- JUVENILE OFFENDERS THAT ARE IN OUR SYSTEM. ARE SOME OF THE MOST MONTHLY AND BEHAVE EARLY CHALLENGED INDIVIDUALS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR SYSTEM AND WE FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THIS PROPOSAL WILL ALLOW. FOR GREATER MENTAL AND MENTAL HEALTH AND THERAPEUTIC TREATMENT OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS HELPING THEM REINTEGRATE INTO SOCIETY AS THEY MOVE FORWARD IN THEIR CAREERS. WE WE SO FULLY SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL AND WE HOPE TO THE CONVERSATION WILL GO FORWARD -- WITH MORE AN INCLUSIVE TREATMENT -- OF OF MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I'D LIKE TO BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] MS RUBIO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- I UNDERSTAND THAT -- THE ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATES AN INCREASE OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND% SIXTY YOUTH. ARE IN THE SYSTEM AS A RESULT OF THE RECENT POLICY CHANGES IS THERE ANY MORE EXPLANATION OR ANY KIND OF BOX INSIDE YOU CAN GIVE US ON THAT [inaudible] ANYONE -- JUST TO BE CLEAR WE'RE NOT ASKED ME INCREASE OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY THE YOUTH. WE'RE ESTIMATING AN INCREASE TO SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTIETH ROUGHLY. SO I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY MORE LIKE AN INCREASE OF ABOUT SIXTY OR SEVENTY IN THE BUDGET YEAR THAT WE'RE PROJECTING. BUT THERE'S AN INCREASE YES AND THAT IS PRIMARILY RELATED. TO EXCUSE ME THE YOUNG ADULT OFFENDER PROGRAM. WHICH IS IS DESIGNED TO DIVERT -- INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE WENT INTO THE ADULT CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM -- TO DJJ WHERE THEY CAN RECEIVE MORE ROBUST REHABILITATIVE SERVICES -- WE RECOGNIZE THAT DJJ IS -- BETTER SUITED TO DEAL WITH. FOLKS YOUNGER OFFENDERS THEIR PSYCHOLOGY IS DIFFERENT THAN ADULT OFFENDERS THE RESPOND DIFFERENTLY TO PROGRAMMING AND SO THE IDEA WAS TO TO PUT THOSE INDIVIDUALS IN IN DJJ WHERE THEY WOULD RECEIVE ARE. MORE APPROPRIATE SERVICES. AND THAT'S THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THE INCREASE IN THE POPULATION [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MATHIS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. DIRECTOR SUPPLE AS THAT. IN A SENSE. SO I I'D REALLY LIKE READING ANSWER THE LA US QUESTIONS ON THE THAT THEY BROUGHT UP BECAUSE I KNOW I'M SITTING HERE AND IT'S YOU KNOW I'M HERE AND REALLY GOOD THINGS FROM FROM THE PUBLIC -- YEAH I REALLY RESPECT THE OPINIONS OF THOSE THAT THAT WORK WITH THESE POPULATIONS ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS IN IN HEARING THE THE PSYCH TAX IN THE PROBATION OFFICERS IN THE THOSE FOLKS BE IN SUPPORT. I I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT WITH I'VE GOT TO ASK. WHAT'S STOPPING YOU WALL FROM DOING THIS NOW. BECAUSE I I I I WAS A CERTAIN FOR TEN YEARS I'VE SEEN ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT UNITS ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT THINGS OVER MY LIFETIME. AND THE WHAT I GOT A FALL UNDER DIFFERENT APARTMENT TO DO WHAT YOU KNOW NEEDS TO BE DONE. BUT WHAT IF YOU GET IF YOU GET START WITH ANSWERING THE LA OWES QUESTIONS I THINK THAT BE GREAT FOR FOR ALL OF US. IN REALLY THAT THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO NOW I MEAN WHAT. WHAT'S STOPPING YOU NOW. ON TOP OF THE QUESTIONS FROM THE LA. WELL I THINK THAT. FUNDAMENTALLY [inaudible] WE ARE. DOUBLING DOWN ON THE MISSION. OF AND THIS IS ACTUALLY IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE OF HELPING YOUTH WHO HAVE HURT PEOPLE. AND IT DIDN'T HURT THEMSELVES. RETURN SAFELY TO THE COMMUNITY AND BECOME RESPONSIBLE AND SUCCESSFUL ADULTS OKAY THAT THE DEGREE TALKING POINT WHAT. WHAT'S STOPPING YOU FROM DOING THAT NOW FROM WHERE YOU'RE AT VERSUS CHANGING DEPARTMENT WELL I THINK THAT BY A VERSUS CREATING YOU KNOW IT THE AND YOU COULD DO THAT FOR RIGHT NOW TODAY [inaudible] SO. THE IDEA IS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. THAT. DJJ SHOULD BE THE LAST STOP IN THAT SYSTEM THE NEXT STOP SHOULD NOT BE A CELL ON THE ADULT SIDE. AND THAT. IT MEANS THAT. DOMINANTLY THE LENS THROUGH WHICH WE LOOK THROUGH HIS REHABILITATION AS WELL AS DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE. AT HEALTH PLANS IF YOU WILL. AND IT JUST MAKES MORE SENSE THAT. THAT BE BASED IN AN AGENCY WHO THAT TWO IS THE PREDOMINANT MISSION AND FOCUS OF THAT AGENCY SO ORGANIZATIONALLY AND MAKES SENSE TO BE AN ORGAN WITHIN AN ORGANIZATION. THAT SHARES AND IS PREDOMINATELY ABOUT THE EXACT SAME MISSION IMPERATIVE WHICH WE HAVE TO BE ABLE. TO SERVE THESE YOU THE PROPERLY AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE CAPABLE OF RETURNING SAFELY TO THE COMMUNITY. SECONDLY SO MANY OF THE RESOURCES AND SERVICES THAT ARE APPROPRIATE AND FOR THE POPULATION THAT WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO SERVE. OUR HOUSE WITHIN. THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. AND BY BEING WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE FAR GREATER OPPORTUNITY FOR CLOSE. COLLABORATION AND COORDINATION WITH THOSE SERVICES THAN BEING WITHIN CDC ARE. BUT YOU IS THE DIRECTOR DON'T YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHANGE THAT MISSION. WITHOUT CHANGING DEPARTMENTS CERTAINLY. I HAVE YOU KNOW ISN'T IT WITHIN YOUR POWER TO DO THAT. TO CHASE MISSION ABSOLUTELY BEEN TERMS THE ORGANIZATIONAL SETTING THAT WOULD NOT BE IN MY PURVIEW TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND I THINK THE GOVERNOR BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT. IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THAT THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS WITHIN THE ADULT PRISON SYSTEM WHEN THE MISSION OF THE ORGANIZATION SHOULD BE TO HELP GET THE YOUNG PEOPLE. OUT OF THE CRIMINAL GANGS IN THE NAME ON THE WALL IS GOING TO CHANGE HOW THE PEOPLE UNDERNEATH YOU OFFER A THAT THAT COMES FROM THE TOP THAT COMES FROM YOU SIR. ABSOLUTELY AND WE HAVE YOU KNOW A WE HAVE A NUMBER OF STRATEGIES THAT I BELIEVE WOULD BE. MORE EASILY IMPLEMENTED. WITHIN A HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE AGENCY AND THAT THE MOST OF OTHER STATES. THEIR JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS NOT WITHIN THE ADULT PRISON SYSTEM SO IT'S NOT AN OUTLIER IN TERMS OF THE THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL [inaudible] KERN [inaudible] ST. YES INSPIRATION. FRAZIER. THANK YOU MANAGER SO I'M HOPING THAT YOU HAVE HAD SOME KIND OF METHODOLOGY FOR TRACKING PERFORMANCE. ON YOUR OUTCOMES. I'M HOPING THAT IF THIS DOES COME TO FRUITION YOU CAN SHOW ADVANCEMENTS THIS WAS A WORTHWHILE EFFORT -- AND AS MR MATHESON SAID THAT IT WASN'T JUST A NAME CHANGE SO THAT WE CAN. KIND OF START. THE SMOKE AND MIRRORS THING. SO. I WANT TO SEE IF THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN. TO YOU MAKE STRIDES -- THAT YOU KNOW. ACTUALLY MAKES THIS A WORTHWHILE. AND I I COULD NOT AGREE WITH YOU MORE ARE OUTCOME HAS TO BE YOU KNOW FAR MORE YOUNG PEOPLE RETURNING TO THE COMMUNITY. WE NO HARM TO BECOMING RESPONSIBLE AND SUCCESSFUL ADULTS -- FRIGHTENING GAUGED IN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT THAT HAS TO BE THE PRIZE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE. AND AGAIN. IF YOU'VE TRACK PAST PERFORMANCES AND YOU TO TRACK OF THE OF FUTURE PERFORMANCES. THEN IN THE FUTURE BUDGET COMMITTEE HEARINGS I CAN BE SUPPORT OF AND IF YOU'RE NOT MAKING THOSE STRIDES WELL DON'T GAMBLE. YEAH THEN YOU WON'T GET THE MONEY [inaudible] SO. SHOW US THE THE PERFORMANCE SO I ASK. IT IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT AFTER THE FERAL CASE THAT THAT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT. THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT HAVE TO BE DONE BY D. J. J.. AND IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN YOU FINALLY WERE ABLE TO CLOSE THE CASE BECAUSE YOU HAD MADE TO THE U. HAD COMPLIED WITH WHAT WAS REQUIRED UNDER THE FERAL CASE IS THAT NOT CORRECT. THAT'S CORRECT SO YOU. THE WHOLE IDEA AND I REALLY I PERSONALLY APPRECIATE THAT THE GOVERNOR IS LOOKING TO MOVE. OUR YOUTH OUT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS -- THAT ISN'T WHERE THEY BELONG. I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THAT BUT IF WE'RE LOOKING AT RESTORATIVE JUSTICE WRIST LOOKING AT RESTORING OUR USE WE'VE GOT TO FIND A BETTER PLACE FOR THEM. I I I DID WANT TO COMMENT -- HOWEVER THAT. THIS MATTER WAS HEARD SOME. FIVE AND MANY OF THE SUB FIVE MEMBERS. FELT STRONGLY ABOUT HAVING A LONGER TRANSITION HAVING THE TASK FORCE PUT IN HAVING STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS. I A CONCERN AND I HEARD IT FROM PUBLIC COMMENT AND OTHER OTHER COMMENTS WE'VE RECEIVED. IS THAT. MOST EVERYONE AGREES. THAT THIS IS A GOOD THING. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS A GOOD THING -- ART USE FROM ONE DEPARTMENT TO ANOTHER SO YOU DON'T HAVE THE DUPLICATION NOT TRYING TO BRING IN DHHS OVER. TO DJJ TO PROVIDE SERVICES IT'LL NOW BE HOUSED UNDER -- DHHS BUT THE TRANSITION. HOUSE TO BE A GOOD TRANSITION SO THAT. GOING BACK TO THE COMMENTS FROM MR MATHESON -- MISTER FRAZIER THERE WERE SURE THAT THERE'S A CHANGE. IN THE CULTURE SO THAT IT ISN'T JUST TO HELP HOUSING THEM IN ONE DEPARTMENT SOMETHING UP TO ANOTHER. AND THEN LATER TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WITH THE CHANGING CULTURE IS GOING TO BE. BUT TO BE SURE THAT YOUR INTENTIONAL ABOUT THE CHANGE IN THE CULTURE OF HOW THE YOUTH ARE GOING TO BE TREATED -- THE SERVICE IS GOING TO BE PROVIDED. IT IT IT AND ON AND ON I THINK THAT. THE TRANSITION HAS THE CAPACITY AND THE POWER TO SET THE TONE FOR YOUTH RESTORATION WHICH IS REALLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND YES THE TITLE OF THE PROGRAM. DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING BUT A CÃM. IF YOU ARE. IT PROGRAM THAT IS CALLED. LET ME FIND MY NOTES. THE DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION. IT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAN TO BE HOUSED UNDER THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. AND REHABILITATION. AND I THINK THAT -- IT'S SOMETHING THAT -- IS IS PROPERLY NOTED THAT WE THAT IS SOMETHING THAT. WE WOULD WANT. THE PURPOSE IS TO CHANGE AND IMPROVE THESE YOUNG LIVES AND I THINK THAT -- THE CHANGE WOULD BE GOOD TRANSITIONING AWAY FROM NEGATIVE AND TOXIC PRACTICES. THAT OUR CONSTRUCTIVE. IN THE INTEREST OF HOPEFULNESS AND PERSONAL CAPACITY OF THESE YOUNG CALIFORNIANS. I DO WANT TO HEAR MORE FROM YOU -- SPECIFIC IT AND APPRECIATE THAT WE DID RECEIVE THAT THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ALSO -- THAT. THAT WILL FRAME THE FIRST STEPS FOR THIS TRANSITION. BUT A FEW QUESTIONS. IS THE ADMINISTRATION AMENABLE TO SLIGHTLY LONGER TIME FRAME. SPECIFICALLY AN ADDITIONAL YEAR FOR CONSTRUCTION THE BASES OF THE NEW DEPARTMENT AND HOW IT WILL FUNCTION. SO I THINK YOU KNOW LEE MINISTRATIONS AS CHRIS CAN'T FROM HOW HUMAN SERVICES I THINK WE'VE YOU YOU KNOW THIS INITIAL TRANSITION FROM DJ TO THE NEW DEPARTMENT. AS SORT OF YOU KNOW A VERY SORT OF THIS IS. FOR DEEP GOVERNMENT STUFF FOR MOVING ALL THESE POSITIONS OVER GETTING GOING -- YOU KNOW CHUCK IS DOING GREAT WORK ALREADY CHANGING THE CULTURE DJJ WERE LOOKING TO SUPPORT THAT AND WE THINK THIS YEAR'S TRANSITION IS AN APPROPRIATE TIME FRAME FOR THAT. AND YOU ARE AWARE THAT THOUGHT THERE ARE MANY WHO FEEL THAT IT SHOULD BE LONGER BUT I AGREE. CAN CAN WE WORK WITH YOU SPECIFICALLY ON THIS TASK FORCE. A CREATING AN ONGOING TASK FORCE. DURING THIS TRANSITION OF BUT WHAT IS DESCRIBED IN THE AGENDA SO THAT THERE IS A GENUINE COLLABORATION NOT ONLY WITH OUR BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT BUT WITH COMMUNITY STAKE HOLDERS. WHO HOLD EXPERTISE AND VISION IN THIS FIELD YOU KNOW THROUGHOUT? THE FERAL IN CENTS FOR ALL. THERE HAS BEEN THE INVOLVEMENT OF CONSULTANTS AND STAKEHOLDERS AND MYSELF -- MOVING FOR AWHILE I'VE BEEN AT IN INDIRECT RECEIPT OF WELL AS REGULATE CALLED UPON -- THE ASSISTANCE AND SOUGHT THE OUTPUT OF THE INPUT OF INDIVIDUALS BEEN AFFECTED BY THE SYSTEM. VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS STAKEHOLDERS AND CONSULTANTS AND I KNOW THAT -- DOCTOR GALLEY AS WELL IS COMMITTED -- ON AN ONGOING BASIS THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE -- STAKEHOLDERS CONSULTANTS EXPERTISE AT IN IN THE DECISIONS THAT WE ARE ARE MAKING AND AGAIN. SORT OF THAT WITHIN THIS FIRST YEAR. SOME OF THAT THE TASK FORCE A RATHER MUNDANE JUST IN TERMS OF YOUR YOU KNOW THE GOVERNMENT -- PULLING OUT DISCONNECTING AND RECONNECTING -- AND THAT IN TERMS OF THE CRITICAL DECISIONS AND THE LIKE THAT IS AN ONGOING PROCESS THAT WILL CONTINUE TO SEEK OUT. SUPPORT AND AND INPUT FROM FROM STAKEHOLDERS EXPERTS IN THOSE HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THE SYSTEM AND BEING ABLE TO TO DO THAT CORRECTLY. SO I ASSUME THEN THERE WOULD BE NO PROBLEM IN CODIFYING THAT. CONTINUING THE TASK FORCE. I CAN'T SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THAT I'D SAVE YOUR THE MINISTRATIONS OF HER THE CONCERN AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING FOR THE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. ALL RIGHT IT WILL TERMS OF NEXT STEPS I I'M GOING TO ASK -- OUR STAFF TO CONTINUE TO TAKE FEEDBACK ON RECOMMENDED CHANGES. TO THE ADMINISTRATION -- SPECIFICALLY REGARDING THE TRAILER BILL. LANGUAGE -- AND I ALSO WANT TO BE ABLE TO COORDINATE WITH. A SUB FIVE WITH THE BUDGET SUB. FIVE IN ADOPTINGLANGUAGE -- IN THE MAY REVISE -- WE ALL HAVE A GOOD BUT JUST A FEW MORE WEEKS LEFT BUT I THINK IT IS. EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND WE HAVE HEARD FROM SO MANY STAKEHOLDERS -- AND I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT THERE HAS BEEN A TASK FORCE THAT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING NEW. BUT I THINK THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE -- AS WE DO TRANSITION. I DO WANT TO REMAIN -- INFORMED ABOUT THE STATUS AND I'M. SURE THE REST OF THE THE MEMBERS WOULD LIKE. TO REMAIN INFORMED -- AS A DISCUSSIONS MOVE FORWARD. OF AND I WILL LAST STAFF TO CONTINUE IN. GATHERING THE INFORMATION. SO THAT WE DO PUT THE APPROPRIATE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. FOR THIS TRANSITION. BUT AGAIN I DO WANT TO SAY THAT I'M VERY GLAD ABOUT THE PROPOSAL. I DON'T I'VE HEARD VERY FEW COMMENTS. FROM THOSE SAYING THAT IT IS NOT A GOOD THING. WE DO NEED TO CHANGE THE CULTURE THOUGH AND I THINK THAT. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE LEADERSHIP. OF THE D. EIGHT DHHS IT JUST HAS TO DO WITH MAKING SURE THAT THE STAKEHOLDERS WHO'D BEEN WORKING WITH A POPULATION. ARE HEARD IN DURING THIS TRANSITION. VERY GOOD ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. VERY GOOD. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I WOULD LIKE THE PANELISTS FROM ISSUE ELEVEN TO COME FORWARD YES WHEN WE TAKE FROM -- REYES HERE FRAZIER. AT THIS PATTERSON RAMOS RUBIO DOCTOR WOULD [inaudible] QUORUM [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. TO TO RINKER. TO LIKE TO BEGIN OKAY HAPPY TO DO SO MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS PITCHER BANK A CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES -- WHAT WHAT YOU HAVE HERE IS IS AN ITEM THAT'S IMPORTANT TO US I I JUST WANT TO OPEN WITH? A THERE IS NO PROPOSAL FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AT THIS TIME EITHER FOR STATE OPERATIONS OR OR FOR LOCAL ASSISTANCE ON THE TOPIC OF AN APPLICATION HUB -- BUT IT'S AN ITEM THAT REMAINS OF SIGNIFICANT INTEREST -- TO US FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS I I WANT TO APPRECIATE THE STAFF AND A THOROUGH DISCUSSION OF THE ISSUE. AND PERHAPS TURN TO PAGE -- FIFTY FOUR IN THE AGENDA TO TALK ABOUT THE KEY OBJECTIVES OF WHAT AN APPLICATION HUB IS. IN A NOT SHOW IN THE APPLICATION PROCESS PEOPLE COME FORWARD THEY PRESENT INFORMATION COUNTY STAFF GENERALLY SPEAKING TO HAVE TO VERIFY THAT INFORMATION RECORDED IN SYSTEMS THAT SAT TRACK -- IT THAT K. THAT INFORMATION EXCHANGE CAN HAPPEN IN A VARIETY OF WAYS IT CAN BE ELECTRONIC -- UGH PEOPLE CAN I HAVE TO BRING IN HARD COPIES OF THEIR PAY STUBS TO PROVE INCOME -- THEY COULD PROVIDE UTILITY BILLS FOR PROOF OF UTILITY COSTS OF THE THAT THAT -- DEDUCTIONS AND SOME ELIGIBILITY PROCESS SEES. ARE WE HAVE THREE DIFFERENT -- STATEWIDE AUTOMATED WELFARE CONSORTIA SYSTEMS THAT THAT PROCESS ELIGIBILITY THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT CAPABILITIES IN TERMS OF DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. AND THEN SOME OF THE VERIFICATIONS THAT WE DO WITH DIFFERENT DATA SOURCES LIKE THE NEW HIRE DATABASE OR EDT WAGE EARNINGS DATABASES. OR OR OR RESIDENCY THEY CAN BE ELECTRONIC OR NOT -- AND SO REALLY THE GOAL OF THE PROJECT -- IN YOUR AGENDA LACES OUT NICELY ON THIS PAGE FOR CLIENTS CLARITY ABOUT WHAT'S REQUIRED AND WHEN -- TRANSPARENCY ABOUT HOW WE DO THE VERIFICATIONS AND AND THE INFORMATION THAT WE'RE RELYING ON THEY SHOULD BE INFORMED HOW WE'RE VERIFYING WHAT THEY GIVE TO US. REDUCING PAPER IF THERE'S A WAY TO ELECTRONICALLY PROVIDE SOMETHING APPLYING DOES HAVE TO GO FETCH AT A DOCTOR'S NO PROOF OF IMMUNIZATION WHATEVER IT HAPPENS TO BE FOR A PARTICULAR PROGRAM. IF WE CAN DO THAT ARE LIKE TRONIC LEE AND LEAVE THE PAPERWORK BURDEN THAT'S CLEARLY OF A BENEFIT TO US -- AND BEING ABLE. TO UPLOAD DOCUMENTS FROM YOUR HOME OR A MOBILE PHONE IN YOUR PAJAMAS WITHOUT HAVING TO BRING THEM DOWN TO A COUNTY OFFICE IN PERSON. HAND THEM TO SOMEBODY GET THEM STAMP TO AND UPLOAD IT THAT'S CLEARLY A BENEFIT FOR CLIENTS. AND THEN OBVIOUSLY FOR THE PROGRAM STAFF HANDLING THAT THE LAST PAPER THEY HAVE TO TOUCH THE MORE TIMELY THAT WE CAN VERIFY THE INFORMATION GIVEN TO US. FROM A QUIET AND AND COUNTY PERSPECTIVE YOU GET ACCURATE MORE ACCURATE ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS MORE ACCURATE BENEFIT DETERMINATIONS -- AND MORE EFFICIENCY IN THE PROCESS TAKING LESS TIME TO DO THINGS SO BENEFITS ALL AROUND. ON PAGE. OF FIFTY THREE SUMMARIZES -- IN THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF -- THE THE DEPARTMENT COMMISSIONED -- SOCIAL INTEREST SOLUTIONS IT'S CONSULTING FIRM THAT WE OBTAINED AFTER A BID PROCESS. TO DO A MASSIVE STAKEHOLDER A REACH THE INCLUDED CLIENTS AND COUNTIES AND OTHER STATE DEPARTMENTS. AND AND THE THE FINDINGS THERE ARE ARE SUMMARIZED FOR YOU ON PAGE -- FIFTY THREE IT'S NO SECRET THINGS ARE COMPLEX ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS HAVE DIFFERENT RULES WE USE DIFFERENT IT SYSTEMS FOR IT -- HOUSEHOLD CAN BE DEFINED AS AN INDIVIDUAL AS A FAMILY THAT'S RELATED TO EACH OTHER IT CAN BE FAMILIES SPIKE FOR CALIBRATION THAT ARE IN A HOUSEHOLD THAT PREPARES MEALS TOGETHER SO YOUR ROOMMATE COULD BE INCLUDED IN THAT DEFINITION. OF SO DIFFERENT DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS ACROSS PROGRAMS AND WHAT WE NEED TO VERIFY. AND SOME PROGRAMS ARE ON ANNUAL RENEWAL -- SOME ARE ON QUARTERLY OR SEMI ANNUAL -- ACTUALLY NOT TOO MANY ON QUARTERLY ANYMORE -- AND AND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE YOU KNOW NOT TIMELY ACCESS TO ELECTRONIC -- SOURCES OF INFORMATION AND THAT THE PROCESS IS A BIRD IN SOME IN SOME OF THOSE THINGS SO THERE'S A LOT TO THINK ABOUT AS WE THINK AS WE CONSIDER WHAT WE MIGHT WANT TO DO AN APPLICATION HUB -- IT'S NOT JUST STUFF THAT AFFECTS MY DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES IN THE PROGRAMS WE OPERATE BUT OTHER DEPARTMENTS IN AGENCY COULD POTENTIALLY USE THE SO THE CONCEPT OF AN APPLICATION HUB. IS EXACTLY THAT IT'S A HARD THAT'S A A FUNCTION. KIND OF LIKE THE THE HUMAN EQUIVALENT OF YOUR OFFICE MANAGER IN YOUR OFFICE IT'S THE PERSON THAT EVERYBODY NO MATTER WHAT THEY'RE DOING GOES TO TO FIND CERTAIN STUFF LIKE WHERE THE PANS. HOW DO I GET THERE WHO DO I TALK TO TO JOIN THE WATER CLUB WHERE ALL THE QUESTIONS GET ANSWERED? THAT'S THE ELECTRONIC EQUIVALENT THAT WE'RE THINKING OF HERE WITH A HARD PROCESS -- SO AS I SAID IN THE BEGINNING WE DON'T HAVE AN ACTIVE PROPOSAL FOR YOU IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE VERY INTERESTED THOUGH IN PURSUING -- ANYTHING THAT WE DO IN THIS REGARD BECAUSE ITS CLIENT FACING ITS COUNTY FACING IT COMES TOGETHER -- WIT WITH ALL OF THE THE PARTNERSHIPS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR INPUT ON THAT. THROUGH NOT JUST THE IMPLEMENTATION STAGE BUT THE PLANNING STAGE THE DEVELOPMENT STAGE AND THE IMPLEMENTATION STAGE SO. APPRECIATE THAT STAFF IS CLEARLY LAID OUT THE OBJECTIVES IN KEY FINDINGS -- FROM THE REPORT THAT WE DID. OUR AND WE DO INTEND TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE PROCEED GOING FORWARD. AS WE GO FORWARD THE CLIENT FACING NATURE OF THIS KIND OF STUFF THAT THE COUNTY BENEFITING NATURE OF THE STUFF IT'S BOTH GOOD FOR PEOPLE AND GOOD FOR GOVERNMENT. AND WE THINK IT WOULD BE A LOST OPPORTUNITY NOT TO PURSUE IT. I HAVE BEEN ANSWER QUESTIONS I TRY TO BE BRIEF. THANK YOU I KNOW THERE WILL BE QUESTIONS NEXT WITNESS. TYLER WAS PERMANENT FINANCE NOTHING HAD. BRENT METZ CARELLI -- NO COMMENTS ON THIS ITEM. THE LET'S OPEN IT UP TO PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE HUB. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FRANK MECCA WITH THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION ON BEHALF OF THE AGENCIES THAT ADMINISTER THESE PROGRAMS ON YOUR BEHALF. WE LARGELY CONCUR WITH WHAT MR CHIPPING CAST SAID ABOUT. THE VALUE IN LOOKING AT AN APPLICATION HOW TO SIMPLIFY THE VERIFICATION PROCESS FOR CLIENTS AND FOR WORKERS -- AND IT'S NOT GOOD GOVERNMENT AS WELL WE LOOK FORWARD TO BEING PART OF CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS AND WE JUST MAKE A NOTE. THE THE RECOMMENDATION FROM THE THE CONSULTANT TO TO DELAY. OUT TWO YEARS SIX THROUGH TEN THE INCORPORATION OF SAWS INTO WHAT MIGHT BE A NEW APPLICATION HUB. IS SOMETHING WE'D LIKE MORE DISCUSSION OF BECAUSE WE SEE A VALUE IN HAVING THAT INTEGRATION FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE ENTIRE PROCESS. THAT THE SMALL DETAIL I KNOW THE ISSUE FOR TODAY IS SORT OF IS THERE CONSENSUS THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT WAY TO GO. AND WE WOULD CAN CONCUR WE WOULD CONCUR THAT THIS IS A VALUABLE THING TO PURSUE [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU TRACY PATTERSON WITH CALIFORNIA FOOD POLICY ADVOCATES JUST SIMPLY WANT TO SAY WE THINK THIS IS A REALLY GOOD PROJECT AND WE SUPPORTED MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE YES MISTER FRAZIER. WE'VE HEARD TIME AND TIME AGAIN THAT THE BUREAUCRACY. ACTUALLY AFFECTS THE CONSUMER OF THE CLIENT -- WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS IN DOING THIS IS ESSENTIAL -- WERE IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND WE'RE STILL USING METHODOLOGIES AND WE'RE DONE AND IN.

OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS. AFTER THAT WHO WANTS. TO I WOULD LIKE THE SUBCOMMITTEE TO CONSIDER REPORTING LANGUAGE ASKING AUTOMATION PROJECTS TO SUMMARIZE AND COMMUNICATE. HOW CURRENT PROJECT DEVELOPMENTS -- MEETING THE TECHNICAL AND NONTECHNICAL RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE ROAD MAP THAT WE'VE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE.

COMMENTS ANY OF ANYTHING ELSE. ALL RIGHT I DO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS I WE WANTED TO TAKE THIS FIRST. YOU'RE RIGHT THERE IS NO PROPOSAL HERE BUT I THINK IF IT SETS THE THE THE THE FOUNDATION FOR EVERYTHING ELSE WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT -- YOU'RE RIGHT WE DO NEED A HUB WE NEED TO HAVE SOMETHING TO CENTRALIZE ALL OF THE INFORMATION TO STREAMLINED IT IS MISTER FRAZIER WHOSE AS INDICATED SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE PACKETS IN PACKETS TO GIVE TO PEOPLE WHEN THEY APPLY. FOR THE PROGRAM. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. WITHOUT TO THEY WERE MOVED TO BACK. TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO OKAY HELLO HELLO I'M CYNTHIA TUCKER WITH THE OFFICE OF SYSTEMS INTEGRATION AND I'M JOINED BY MY TO PROGRAM SPONSORS -- FROM DEPARTMENT DEVELOPMENT SERVICES JIM NIGHT AND FROM THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES ANASTASIA DOTSON -- WANTED JUST BRING FORWARD THAT THE INFORMATION THE AGENDA IS. IS VERY WELL WRITTEN IS FOR WITH HER CROSSED US PHASE ONE AND PHASE -- TWO WANTED TO I WAS AT WE WERE ASKED TO BE ABLE TO KIND OF SPEAK TO HOW THE THE TO WORK TOGETHER YOU MIGHT SAY -- EBV HAS AN EFFECT ACROSS FIVE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTAL PROGRAMS SO. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT BCP IS FOCUSED ON THE IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES PROGRAM WHICH IS -- MANAGER OPERATED BY AT CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES AND IT FOCUSES ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND MODIFICATIONS NEEDED FOR THE SAME SYSTEM. THE SECOND PIECE THE SPRING FINANCE LETTER IS FOCUSED ON AT ALL OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS ACROSS CDA DDS DH CS IN CD PH -- WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT -- AN AGENCY WIDE MODEL FOR EBV IMPLEMENTATION -- SO. INSTEAD YOU LIKE TO ADD ANYTHING. ANASTASIA DOESN'T PERMIT HEALTH CARE SERVICES WERE LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS IN THE COMING MONTHS. AS WE EXAMINE THE OPTIONS AND DEVELOP A RECOMMENDED APPROACH AND WILL CERTAINLY KEEP YOUR STAFF IN THE LOOP ON WONDERFUL THANK YOU. IT JIM NIGHT WITH DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES DON'T HAVE IT AT AND TO BE BACK ON WHAT THE STOCKTON SAID IS THAT. A KEY COMPONENT OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT -- RESOURCES TO HELP COORDINATE THE STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT OBVIOUSLY THE SYNTAX SEVERAL THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS WHO IN SOME CASES YOU SERVICES FROM MULTIPLE DEPARTMENT SO THAT WE CAN. MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE INPUT AND ENGAGEMENT WITH WITH FOLKS NOT ONLY RECEIVE SERVICE BUT BUT THOSE WHO PROVIDE THE SERVICES AS WELL TO HELP INFORM THIS THANK YOU. STEPHEN PUBLIC BERMAN FINANCE WOULD NOT BEEN AT BRENT METZ CORELLIA WE REVIEWED THIS PROPOSAL AND HAVE NO CONCERNS THANK YOU. LET'S OPEN IT TO PUBLIC COMMENT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FRANK MACKESY TO BE D. A. R. MEMBERS EMPLOY THE SOCIAL WORKERS IN THE UNITED STATES PROGRAM AND ADMINISTER THAT PROGRAM. SHE ATE THE EFFORTS BY THE ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE EBV IMPLEMENTATION AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE.

TO MAKE SURE THAT THE IMPACT ON THE SOCIAL WORKERS IN THE SYSTEM IS ACCOUNTED FOR SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THE ASSISTANCE TO CLIENTS AND PROVIDERS THAT DON'T NEED [inaudible] THANK YOU. SPRING TO BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. WHAT I WANT TO JUST OF FOR CLARIFICATION? THIS SPRING OF FINANCE LETTER IS ASKING FOR RESOURCES LARGELY FOR PHASE TWO OF THIS DVD IT IS. YES YES MA'AM IT'S FOCUSED ON FACE TO AND IT'S REALLY TO BEGIN THE PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE SO -- WE'VE DONE A BUSINESS ANALYSIS WE ARE NOW ABOUT TO KICK OFF -- STAGE GET TO WHICH IS THE ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS DH CS AND DS -- WILL BE LEADING ALL OF THE FIVE DEPARTMENTS IN THAT ANALYSIS TO SEE HOW EXISTING SYSTEMS OR AN EXISTING -- ITEMS THAT PROVIDERS ARE ALREADY USING CAN BE LEVERAGED -- AT IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHAT A RECOMMENDED SOLUTION FOR THIS IS AGENCY WIDE -- EFFORT SHOULD BE THAT FITS. WITH ALL THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE IS ALREADY THERE WONDERFUL. GIVEN THE UPDATED COST THAT WE'VE RECEIVED I WOULD LIKE TO ASK FOR UPDATED COMPREHENSIVE TOTAL PROJECT. COSTS ACROSS FISCAL YEARS. ONE WOULD BE REASONABLE. TO RECEIVE THESE BY THE END OF THE WEEK BY NEXT WEEK WE DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC PROJECT COST BECAUSE IN THE PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO PROJECT YET. WE DO HAVE -- HIGH LEVEL PLANNING COSTS THAT UP THAT WE'RE EXPECTING OVER. A COURSE OF COMPLETING THE PAL THE ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS WAS A TO ALTURAS ANALYSIS IS REALLY THE END OF THAT AND THAT APPROVAL. REALLY THEN FORMULATES WHAT THE PROJECT COST IN TIME WHEN WOULD LOOK LIKE SO WE'RE WE'RE A BIT AWAYS FROM BEING ABLE TO GIVE YOU THE THE EXTENSIVE PROJECT COSTS. WELL I WOULD ASK THAT THIS BE SHARED WITH STAFF -- EVEN IF IT'S JUST THE HIGH LEVEL PROJECT COSTS. TO DO THAT FOR US PLEASE. VERY GOOD THANK YOU I THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION. IT WILL BE HELD OPEN ISSUE THREE SOME. THANK YOU I LIKE BOTH OF YOU JUST I LIKE IT JUST BOOM BOOM YOU KNOW THAT I'M DONE -- OF COURSE AND JOIN WITH BUY A PEEP TRIMMING GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS SOCIAL SERVICES AND RENEE MAILLOT FROM DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES. ONCE AGAIN THE WHAT'S BEEN LAID OUT BY STAFF. COMPLETELY EXPLAINS THE THE PROPOSAL AND SO I WAS WONDERING IF THERE ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS WITH REGARDS TO THIS PROPOSAL -- THAT AREN'T ALREADY LAID OUT. I KNOW THAT WOULD BE THE EASIEST WAY TO DO IT BUT I'D LIKE TO DO NOT BLOCK COMMENT FIRST YEAH SO IF YOU'LL JUST TWO BRIEF PRESENTATION -- SO THE MEDS MODERNIZATION OP EFFORT -- IS TOO MUCH NONE THE LESS I THANK YOU -- FOR FOR SAYING SUCH WONDERFUL THINGS ABOUT STAFF YOU'RE RIGHT IT IS. IT IS SO SO NICELY DONE. OKAY SO -- THE MEDS MODERNIZATION EFFORT IS A MULTI DEPARTMENTAL EFFORT TO TAKE THE MEDS SYSTEM WHICH STORES -- ELIGIBILITY DATA IN REGARDS TO AND NUMEROUS -- PUBLICLY SUBSIDIZED HEALTH HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS ACROSS -- MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IT HAS -- LAID ON TOP OF OR SORRY THAT IT'S MADE FROM REALLY GOES BACK TO THE EARLY SEVENTIES -- IT WAS ORIGINALLY IMPLEMENTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE I BELIEVE. AND SO THAT WAS HARD TO BELIEVE WHAT I READ THE YEAH WE'RE A LITTLE YOU KNOW. WE'RE A LITTLE OUT OF DATE -- THOUGH THAT THE SYSTEM RUNS VERY WELL -- AS IT CURRENTLY STANDS BUT IT'S NOT FLEXIBLE WITH REGARDS TO SOME OF THE INTER OPERABILITY IS THAT WE'RE LOOKING OUT FOR CROSS PROGRAMS ACROSS STATE -- WHEN IT COMES -- TO YOU KNOW INTERACTIVITY. SO WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW WITH THIS EFFORT IS TO TAKE BY FACE STARTING WITH THE HEALTH INFORMATION SYSTEM. UP WHICH IS A SUBSET OF THE OF THE MEDS AND WE'RE LOOKING TO MODERNIZE THE FIRST WE'RE DOING THE MODERNIZATION AND FOR FACE EFFORT THAT WILL BE MULTI YEAR -- ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THIS IS WE WANT TO A DO SOME LEARNING -- AS WERE DOING MODULAR NOT ONLY THAT BUT E WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE MOVING METHODICALLY UNDERSTANDING TO MINIMIZE THE LAST THING WE WANT IS ANY IMPACT BENEFICIARIES AS WORKS MOVING. UP INFORMATION OR INNER CONNECTIVE ITTY WITH THE SIZE AND CAL HERE'S AS ARE MODERNIZING AT NOT ONLY THAT WE WANT TO REDUCE IMPACT FOR COUNTY WORKERS WHO VERY MUCH RELY HEAVILY ON THE MEDS -- FOR A NUMBER OF FAIR. BUSINESS PROCESS SEES. SO THAT'S KIND OF IT OF THE HIGH LEVEL. UNNAMED BUT IN A CURRENT PIECE JUST TO LET YOU KNOW WE ARE INTO PROCUREMENT TO GET OUR FIRST -- DEVELOPMENT VENDOR SO THAT WE CAN START WORKING ON H. I. S. BOTH DATA CONVERSION AS WELL AS AT BUILDING OUT. OF START THE BUILDING OUT OF THE METS MODERNIZATION. WONDERFUL THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. PICTURE BANCO DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES WERE WERE ONE OF THE MAIN USERS OTHER THAN DH CS IN THE SYSTEM WERE HUGELY INTERESTED IN THIS BEING A SUCCESS AND AND MODERNIZING PROVIDING THE CAPABILITY IS THERE. WELL WHAT'S STARTING IN THE IN THE BUDGET YEAR DOESN'T NECESSARILY AFFECT US DIRECTLY IN TERMS OF HEALTH INFORMATION SYSTEMS -- IT'S ABSOLUTELY VITAL THAT THAT WE BE INVOLVED AND IT'S BEEN A GREAT PARTNERSHIP AS AS WE THINK OF AND PLAN AHEAD. FOR FOR WHAT THE SYSTEM NEEDS TO DO HOW ITS ARCHITECTED WHAT ITS FUNCTIONALITIES WILL BE AND WE'RE REALLY GRATEFUL TO BE PART OF THE EFFORT. WONDERFUL THANK YOU. THANK YOU RENE MAILLOT DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND I JUST ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES IN JUST TO REMIND FOLKS THAT WITH. THIS SYSTEM IT IS USED BY THE MEDIC HOW PROGRAM NOT JUST FOR PURPOSES OF ELIGIBILITY BUT ALSO HELPING PROVIDERS TO KNOW WHEN PEOPLE PRESENT IN OUR OFFICES. IF INDIVIDUALS ARE ELIGIBLE AS WELL AS TO ASSIST WITH PAYMENT FOR SERVICES IN THE MEDICAL PARK SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS OP PROPOSAL. THANK YOU. AND I WILL OPEN IT UP TO PUBLIC COMMENT -- I'M SORRY. WE HAVE MORE IMPORTANT WITNESSES NOT. AND BRIAN METZGER LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- I WOULD NOTE THAT THIS PROJECT PROPOSALS STILL GOING THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGIES PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE WHICH IS THE STATE'S IT PROJECT APPROVAL PROCESS. AND THE PROJECT ANTICIPATES COMPLETING THAT PROCESS BY FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY AND SO THIS PROPOSES A LITTLE BIT UNIQUE -- IN THAT SOME OF THE DEVELOPMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACTIVITIES THAT YOU HEARD MENTIONED AROUND H. I GUESS WERE ALLOWED IN PARALLEL TO THAT PLANNING PROCESS AND SO -- THAT'S GOING TO ALLOW THEM TO PILOT DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENTS TO KIND OF BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE PROJECT AS WELL TO KIND OF USE H. I. S. AS A PROOF OF CONCEPT FOR THE APPROACH GOING FORWARD -- WE GENERALLY AGREE WITH THAT APPROACH THIS IS A PRETTY COMPLEX AND SIZEABLE PROJECT -- HOWEVER WE ARE CONCERNED THAT IN THE PROPOSAL THERE ARE THERE IS A REQUEST FOR FUNDING FOR OTHER DEVELOPMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACTIVITIES RELATED TO FACE -- TO THAT ARE COMING IN ADVANCE OF COMPLETING THE PLANNING PROCESS -- WERE ALSO CONCERNED A BIT ABOUT BEING ASKED TO APPROVE FOR YOUR LIMITED TERM FUNDING GIVEN THAT AT THE END OF THE PROJECT APPROVAL LIFE CYCLE WILL HAVE A MORE COMPLETE PROJECT PLAN THAT INCLUDES. A FIRM BASE LINE IN THE COSTS GO BEEN SCHEDULED THE PROJECT GOING FORWARD AND SO WE MIGHT YOU KNOW TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS LEGISLATURE MIGHT ASK THE ADMINISTRATIONTO EXPLAIN. HOW THE BUDGET YOU'RE FUNDING FOR PHASE -- TWO IS GOING TO BE USED AND WHY IT'S NECESSARY IN THIS CURRENT PROPOSAL AS WELL AS TO ASK -- HOW THE FOR YOUR LIMITED TERM FUNDING FOR THE PROPOSAL WILL BE USED -- GIVEN THE LEGISLATURE DOES NOT HAVE A COMPLETE PROJECT PLAN SO WITH THAT I'LL LEAVE IT THERE. THANK YOU WELL THERE'S YOUR FIRST QUESTION. I THINK -- ONE OF THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO DO AND WORKING WITH WORKING WITH THE ART DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY AND WITH MOVING -- PHASE ONE OR HAVING FACE WILL BE PART OF THE PROCESS BOB OUR GOAL IN A REQUEST AND ASKING FOR FUNDING FOR PHASE TWO AS WE DO NOT WANT TO HAVE A DELAY -- FROM PHASE ONE PHASE TWO BEGINNING WE HAVE A CONTRACT ON BOARD WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE -- KNOWLEDGE BASE BECAUSE IF WE IF WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR FURTHER WORK WE WOULD END UP LOSING CONTRACT RESOURCES HAVE BEEN WORKING ON H. I. AFTER THE METS MODERNIZATION. SO IT'S REALLY TO STREAMLINE -- ALL OF THE RESOURCES BOTH STATE AND CONTRACTOR SO THAT WE CAN JUST CONTINUE AND JUST KEEP MOVING IN WITH THAT APPROVAL SORT WORKING WITH C. T. ON HOW DO WE MINIMISE -- SO HOW DO WE HOW DO WE MINIMISE THE TIME PHASE ONE AND PHASE TWO BEGINS AND SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING THROUGH WHAT OF THOSE CRITERIA IS ONE OF THOSE CHECKPOINTS. MONTHLY OR BI WEEKLY WHATEVER THEY NEED TO BE ALL THROUGH THE PROCESS SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE. A LARGE APPROVAL. PROCESS AT THE END THAT IT'S MUCH MORE STREAMLINED WE CAN MOVE AS QUICKLY AS EFFECTIVELY INTO -- FACE. TO THAT IS OUR GOAL. AND THE REASON WHY IT HAS SOME OF THE IT HAS SOME OF THE SPACE TO COST IN HERE. IT IT TO ADDRESS THE THE ISSUE FROM LA -- IS OUR LANGUAGE THAT CAN BE PUT IN SO THAT THERE ARE THOSE CHECK POINTS AND THAT IS REVIEWED. AND A TIMELY BASIS I UNDERSTAND YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO STREAMLINE IT -- SO THAT THERE ISN'T A GAP IN THE FUNDING -- IT TO TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF ELIO CAN THERE BE -- THOSE CHECKPOINTS. TO USE YOUR PHRASE I THINK YOU WERE WORKING WITH CITY YES -- YES WE CAN DO THAT WE HAVE WORKING WITH DIGNITY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT WOULD BE -- TO IN SHORT TRANSPARENCY. FOR BELIEVE SOMEBODY WANTS TO ADD MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS RON ROBINETTE WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY. AND TO ADDRESS WHAT MR MASTERS SAYING. I'M THERE ARE CHECKS AND BALANCES BUILT INTO THE PROJECT APPROVAL PROCESS SAID THAT IF THERE. THE BUDGET FOR THIS EFFORT AND SAT BEING. 20% OVER WAS ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED OR FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WHICHEVER IS LESS THAN THERE WOULD BE A PAUSE AND THAT DISCUSSION WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND AND OTHERS. ON WHAT THE NEXT STEPS FOR THE PROJECT WOULD BE. ADDITIONALLY SINCE THIS MONEY IS CONSIDERED. A PLANNING DOLLARS FOR THE PROJECT THE PROJECT WILL BE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT A QUARTERLY PROJECT EXPENDITURE REPORT. TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHICH WILL OUTLINE HOW THEY'RE EXPENDING THESE MONIES FOR THE PROJECT AS WELL AS THAT THE FUTURE MONIES FOR THE OVERALL PROJECT THANK YOU. I BRIAN METZGER LA -- APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS THIS BUILT IN CHECK POINT OF THE FIVE MILLION OR 20% WHICHEVER IS LESS -- BUT WE WOULD STILL NOTE THAT THAT LANGUAGE -- REFERENCES AN ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS THAT'S DONE BY THE ADMINISTRATION AND WE WOULD LIKE THAT ANALYSIS TO BE SHARED WITH THE LEGISLATURE SO THAT WE ARE AWARE. OF WHAT CHANGES NEED TO BE MADE IN THE PROJECT SCOPE SCHEDULER COST TO BE ABLE TO BRING IT MORE IN LINE WITH WHAT WAS ESTIMATED REGIONALLY. THAT I WOULD LIKE TO EL SKELLY -- TO HELP -- CRAFT THE LANGUAGE. THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE. SO WE CAN SO WE CAN CAPTURE EXACTLY WHAT IT IS THAT -- LA THOSE CONCERNS HAPPY TO DO SO. THANK YOU [inaudible] NO. NOW WILL OPEN IT UP TO A PUBLIC COMMENT. I THINK WE HEARD FROM THE ONLY PERSON IN THE PUBLIC THEM. ALL RIGHT LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE MISTER FRAZIER THANK YOU. SO. IN A PREVIOUS CHAIRMANSHIP I WAS THE CHAIR OF THE COUNT ABILITY IN ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW COMMITTEE. AND WE DID HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY IN I THINK OF CARLOS WAS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AT THAT POINT. WE'VE HAD MANY IMPLEMENTATION OF PROGRAMS IN DIFFERENT AGENCIES THAT HAVE BEEN. WHAT I WOULD SAY LESS THAN SATISFACTORY? WHAT ARE THE STOP GAP SAID HAVE BEEN LEARNED AND PERFORMANCE METRICS THAT HAVE BEEN LEARNED -- SINCE THIS CAL [inaudible] JUDICIARY [inaudible] DMV. I MEAN IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S BEEN AN ONGOING LISTING YOU LOOK AT THE MONIES IS GOING TO BE SPENT HERE WHAT ASSURANCES WE HAVE. THIS IS ACTUALLY GONNA WORK I SEE SOME INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION VALIDATION FROM INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS BUT I DON'T THINK THAT I'M SEEING. ASSURANCES THAT THIS MONEY IS GOING TO BE SPENT IN AN APPROPRIATE FASHION. THAT WE'VE LEARNED OUR LESSON AND THIS IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO GO FORWARD SO THAT WE ACTUALLY GET THE VALUE THAT WE'RE SPENDING FOR BECAUSE IN THE PAST. WE HAVEN'T. AND THE ONLY ONE THERE TO GET RIPPED OFF FOR THE TAXPAYERS. SO CAN YOU SHOW ME THAT THE THAT WE'VE LEARNED OUR LESSON WE'RE GONNA GO IN ADVANCE AND WE'RE GONNA ALSO REPORTS LEGISLATURE AN APPROPRIATE FASHION. THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY WORKING AND YOU YOUR MONEY THAT YOU'RE SPENDING. ABSOLUTELY WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT THERE'S LESSONS THAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM THE LARGER PROJECTS SMALLER PROJECTS LESSONS THAT WE LEARNED WITH AND PROJECTS FROM THE DEPARTMENTS -- A PSYCH CETERA. WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH CDG THEY'VE ASKED BEEN ASKING US QUESTIONS TO HELP US HONE ARE PROOF OF CONCEPT -- AS WELL AS TO ASSISTANCE THROUGH THE PROVIDE CYCLE IN ORDER -- TO INSURE THAT ALL OF US ARE ASKING THE APPROPRIATE QUESTIONS. THIS PROOF OF CONCEPT THE WHOLE THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF HAVING THIS IS PART OF THE POWER IS TO LEARN AND SEE. IS THE STRATEGY ARE THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE'VE MADE ARE THEY ACCURATE DO THEY NEED TO BE TWEAKED A BIT BEFORE WE HAVE AN APPROVED PROJECTS SO OUR GOAL. IS VERY MUCH IN ALIGNMENT WITH YOURS WHICH IS TO ENSURE THAT WE LEARN SOMETHING AND SAID THE PROJECT OFF ON THE STRONGEST FOOTING WE CAN'T -- SO. IN THE IN THAT REGARD THAT THAT'S THE INSURANCE I CAN GIVE IS THAT THAT'S THE WORK WE'RE DOING IS. TO DO AS MUCH AS PROACTIVELY AS POSSIBLE TO ENSURE THAT THE PROJECT IS SUCCESSFUL AND I'M NOT TRYING. TO DIMINISH YOUR YOUR OF VIGOR. BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY TOLD US BEFORE. THESE OTHER AGENCIES. AND SO WHAT TO INSURANCE IS DO WE HAVE. THAT -- THERE ARE STOP GAP MEASURES THAT. THIS GOES FORWARD THEY'RE PROBABLY FASHION DOESN'T GET INTO. A PROGRAMMING NIGHTMARE THAT DOESN'T WORK FOR CERTAIN AGENCIES THEN WE HAVE TO PUT BANDAIDS ON AND THEN I HAVE TO PUT MORE MONEY INTO IT. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM THE PAST. AND THAT WE DON'T CONTINUE WHAT'S THAT -- EINSTEIN THANK. THE INSANITY. YOU KNOW THE WE DON'T PERPETUATE THAT DO THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER YEAH YEAH YEAH DEFINITION. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT. I'LL BLOW MY TOP. YOU KNOW SERIOUSLY WE'VE GOT A WE'VE GOT TO DO BETTER. AND THAT'S WHAT THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING. SO AND I THINK WE ALL AGREE WITH YOU. THE MEMBER FRAZIER IF I CAN ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION DIRECTLY ON SOME OF THE STOP GAPS AGAIN RON ROBINETTE WITH DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY FOR THIS SPECIFIC EFFORT -- THEY HAVE WENT THROUGH THE RIGOR OF THE PROJECT APPROVAL BY CYCLE WHICH INCLUDES A LOT MORE PLANNING MEASURES -- THAN THOSE OTHER PROJECTS IN THE PAST. VERY STAGE GATES THAT THEY'VE HAD TO UP MATURE THROW IN THEIR PLANNING EFFORT AND THEN WE'VE TAKEN A SPECIAL APPROACH WITH THIS PROJECT THAT YOU THAT YOU'VE HEARD. WERE WERE ALLOWING THIS PROOF OF CONCEPT WHETHER STILL IN PLANNING. TO ENSURE THAT THE PROJECT DOLLARS THAT ARE ASKED FOR FOR THE ENTIRE EFFORT ARE VALIDATED AND WE WE HAVE SOME BASIS FOR THAT. ADDITIONALLY ONCE THIS PROJECT IS FORMALLY LAUNCHED -- IT WILL REQUIRE MONTHLY A PROJECT STATUS REPORTING FROM THE PROJECT AND THEN ALSO DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY INDEPENDENT. PROJECT OVERSIGHT REPORT WILL BE DONE ON A MONTHLY BASIS BASIS. IN ADDITION TO THE INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION THAT WILL BE DONE WITH THE PROJECT SO MANY REPORTS THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE PUBLICLY INCLUDING TO THE LEGISLATURE -- THAT WILL GIVE YOU STATUS AND HOW THIS PROJECT IS GOING. I APPRECIATE THAT AND AND AND AGAIN WE'VE WILL HOPEFULLY WE'VE LEARNED FROM OUR PAST. FULL PAUSE -- GOING FORWARD YEAH IT LOOKS SO I LOOK FORWARD. TO AN IMPLEMENTATION THAT IS. OF NOT SO MUCH FOLLOW SANDERS AND THERE CAN BE BUGS AND IN EVERY. IMPLEMENTATION. BUT WHO'S GONNA BE RESPONSIBLE THAT ISN'T. WHO'S GOING OF THE WEATHER THE BUCK STOPS [inaudible] LOOKS. YES I DID. THROUGH WHERE DOES THE BUCK STOP WHO DO I CONTACT. BECAUSE I'M HERE FOR ANOTHER SIX YEARS THIS PROJECT WILL BE. UP AND RUNNING BY THEN I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHO'S GONNA TAKE THE WHO'S GONNA TAKE THE THE PLANET DOESN'T OR THE CREDIT. YEAH I LIKE THAT I LIKE THE CREDIT PIECE -- OSI IS LEADING THIS EFFORT IN REGARD IT WITH -- WITH -- ASSISTANCE WITH OUR DEPARTMENT SO I THINK THE STARTING POINT IS WITH US I WOULD JUST READ CELL NUMBERS OKAY. THEY MIGHT CALL YOU RIGHT ON THE DID YOU WANT TO PROVIDE. I I I WOULD JUST ADD A COUPLE EXAMPLES OF SPECIFICS YOU KNOW WE TALKED IT ALL ALREADY TODAY ABOUT TRANSPARENCY A PUBLIC REPORTING -- WE FOUND IN A NUMBER OF THE PROJECTS THAT WE RELY ON AT AT SOCIAL SERVICES THAT ONE OF OUR OUR BEST -- PRACTICES IS TO INVOLVE THE LEGISLATURE ON A QUARTERLY OR SEMI ANNUAL BASIS WHERE WE OFFER A BRIEFING TO STAFF SIT DOWN TALK THROUGH WHAT WE'RE DOING. THERE'S NO SURPRISES WITH THAT -- OTHER EFFORTS THAT WE'VE DONE -- SUCH AS CAL SAWS THAT WE'LL TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT LATER WE HAVE AN ONGOING STAKEHOLDER MEETING ALL OF THE MATERIALS FOR THOSE MEETINGS ALL THE DISCUSSIONS THE NOTES. ARE PUBLICLY POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE AT TRANSPARENCY GOES A LONG WAY TO LA OWES POINT ABOUT FOR YOUR LIMITED TERM POSITIONS -- I KNOW IS AT MY DEPARTMENT ALTHOUGH WE ASK FOR LIMITED TERM RESOURCES WE DON'T MAKE LIMITED TERM JOB OFFERS TO PEOPLE WE MAKE PERMANENT JOB OFFERS BECAUSE WE NEED THE STABILITY ON THE PROJECT I CAN'T COME BACK EVERY TWO YEARS. AND AND TELL YOU WELL THE PERSON I GAVE IT TO YOUR JOB OFFER TO KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO LOSE IT SO THEY TOOK ANOTHER ONE SIX MONTHS AGO. I CAN'T RUN A PROJECT LIKE NOT SO STABILITY IN PROJECT LEADERSHIP IS IMPORTANT -- YOU KNOW BACK TO WHERE I STARTED WITH ABOUT ENGAGEMENT IN TRANSPARENCY IF THERE ARE PARTICULAR ITEMS THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS CONCERNED THAT WE MIGHT NOT BE THINKING ABOUT WE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR THAT BACK TO NOT JUST US TELLING YOU. WHERE WE'RE AT BUT ALSO? HEARING FROM YOU. YOU CLEARLY HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE WITH IT PROJECTS WE'VE HAD SOME SUCCESSES SEE MAPS TO IS A SUCCESS NOT BE T. TRANSITION AS AS WE DO DO THINGS RIGHT AND WE TRY TO LEARN FROM THOSE AS WELL. STARTING SMALL THE PROOF OF CONCEPT BIKE IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WE START WITH A SMALL PIECE OF IT TO SEE IF IT'S ACTUALLY GONNA WORK AND WE FAIL CHEAPLY IN EARLY -- AS OPPOSED TO HERE'S A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SEE YOU IN FOUR YEARS AND COME BACK TO US AND WE'LL SEE IF IT WORKS -- YOU KNOW WE KNOW THOSE KINDS OF APPROACHES DON'T WORK USER CENTERED DESIGN IS IN OUR JEFF. ANYWAY THE POINT B. AND IF YOU HAVE A LIST OF THINGS THAT ARE OF PARTICULAR CONCERN WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THAT EARLY ON IN OUR PLANNING PROCESS IT WOULD WELCOME THAT DIALOGUE IS THERE ANY FORM OF PEER REVIEW COMMITTEE AS THE PROCESS GOES ON WE FOUND IN LARGER. PROJECTS THAT WHEN YOU INTEGRATE THE PRIVATE SECTOR WITH. SAVE ON DUTY AND YOUR AGENCY PROFESSIONALS THAT WHEN THERE'S A PEER REVIEW COMMITTEE THAT ACTUALLY CAN COME THROUGH AND SAY -- THE AND VALIDATE LIKE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AT AT THE STOP GAP. BONUS -- UNBIASED ON A BASH TO READY TO GO WITH THE INFORMATION AND YOU KNOW. IS THERE ANY KIND OF OF PURPOSE OR ANY COMMITTEE LIKE THAT APPEAR REVIEW COMMITTEE I I I WOULD ANSWER IT THIS WAY THE HHS AGENCY IS A LITTLE BIT UNIQUE. THE OFFICE OF SYSTEMS INTEGRATION IN OUR AGENCY ACTUALLY KIND OF PERFORMS THAT FUNCTION BECAUSE THEY'RE THE PROJECT MANAGER ON BEHALF OF ALL THE PROJECT SO THEY HAVE THE VISIBILITY TO THAT. THAT'S IN ADDITION TO OUTSIDE VENDORS LIKE IVY ENVY OR THE INDEPENDENT PROJECT OVERSIGHT CONSULTANTS THAT WE TALKED AYE POCK THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT SO WE HAVE A COMBINATION OF THOSE THINGS. WHEN WE HIRE A VENDOR WE DON'T? KIND OF PAY THEM PUT THEM IN A ROOM AND NOT TALK TO THEM YOU KNOW THAT'S LIKE ARE WE WILL IS WHAT WE'RE DOING MAKES SENSE HOW WOULD YOU DO IT. WE'RE INCREASINGLY TRYING TO DEFINE THE OUTCOME OF WHAT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE AND NOT DEFINED THE HOW YOU HAVE TO GET THEIR WHICH IMPOSES A LIMIT AND ALLOWS THAT CREATIVE THINKING AND THE TWO WAY DIALOGUE. SO THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING CAN WE GUARANTEE SUCCESS OF COURSE NOT. CAN WE GUARANTEE TRANSPARENCY INTO A CLEAR DISCUSSION OF ISSUES AS THEY ARISE AND BEST EFFORTS TO RESOLVE THEM ABSOLUTELY. AND PARTICULARLY ON THE LARGE PROJECTS THAT YOU'RE HEARING ABOUT TODAY WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR ADEQUATE STATE STAFF SUPPORT. FOR WE FOUND THAT WHERE WERE UNDER RESOURCE AND DON'T HAVE THE SKILL SETS IS EXACTLY WHERE THE PROBLEMS COME UP. RIGHT. I APPRECIATE YOUR AND YOUR SUPPORT AND I'LL DO IT AGAIN I APPRECIATE YOU RECOGNIZING THAT. REVIEWS IS. IMPORTANT PART OF THE YES ABSOLUTELY IT IS THANKS. THANK YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK AND WE TOOK THE APPLICATION HUB FIRST FOR A REASON LIKE I DO WANT TO TO EXPLAIN. HOW THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMEND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE STATE APPLICATION HUB? ARE INFLUENCING THE DESIGN DEVELOPMENT -- AND IT'S BOND -- YEAH BARBARA WHO WANTS TO TALK ABOUT FIRST YEAR [inaudible] OF THE FOR FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE ALTHOUGH AS MISS SMALL INDICATED THERE ARE A VARIETY OF THINGS MEDS DOES THERE'S ACTUALLY I THINK A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY HUNDRED EIGHTY DIFFERENT SYSTEMS THAT MET AND FOUGHT AND OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND FUNCTIONS THAT MEDS INTEROPERATES WITH. SO IT'S A FAIRLY COMPLEX SYSTEM -- IT. FOR OUR PROGRAMS. IT'S VERY OFTEN THE THE SYSTEM OF RECORD -- WHETHER SOMEBODY'S BEEN ON AID WHICH AID CODES THEY'VE BEEN AND AND AND SO WE USE THAT IN OUR ELIGIBILITY PROCESS SEES. I THAT INPUT IS PROVIDED. TO THE MADS LARGELY FROM US -- AND AND IT'S A LOOKUP FUNCTION FOR US. SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT LESS IN TERMS OF THE APPLICATION HARD BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE SYSTEM THAT ACTIVELY FOR US DETERMINING ELIGIBILITY ITS RECORDING ELIGIBILITY. OVER TIME IN THE PROGRAM BLESS YOU THANK YOU. AND ACROSS MULTIROTOR CROSS MULTIPLE PROGRAM SO THE FUNCTION IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FOR US THE HUB IS MOSTLY CENTERED AROUND THE SAUCE SYSTEMS WHICH FOR MEDI CAL CAL FRESH -- I KEEP SAYING TEN F. BUT IT'S CAL WORKS -- AND A VARIETY OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS -- DEBT. THE SAWS IS THE SYSTEM THAT'S PROCESSING ELIGIBILITY THAT WILL BENEFIT THE MOST FROM FROM THE HARM. BUT THE CLIENT CENTERED FOCUS ARE WE GETTING WHAT WE NEED WHEN I THINK OF MADS AND I THINK OF THE THE COUNTY USER FROM MY DEPARTMENTS PERSPECTIVE IT'S THE COUNTY USER THAT'S THE CLIENT. AND ARE THEY ABLE TO GET WHAT THEY WANT RIGHT NOW FOR EXAMPLE A LOT OF THE FUNCTIONALITY WE NEED IS OVERNIGHT BATCH PROCESSING. SO THEY CAN'T ALWAYS GET AN ANSWER WHEN THE CLIENT SITTING IN FRONT OF THEM. AND THEY'RE DOING THE BEST THAT WE CAN IN AT THE MOMENT IN TIME. THAT'S THE KIND OF STUFF WE WANT TO CHANGE AND A HOBBY IN REAL TIME ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION WILL HELP. MODERNIZING MADS PUTTING ON A PLATFORM THAT ALLOWS REAL TIME WILL BE OF ASSISTANCE TO US. BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU LIKE THE HUB IS GOING TO DRAMATICALLY CHANGE THE MEDS BUT THE PRINCIPLE OF OUR USERS GETTING WHAT THEY WANT IS WHAT I WOULD. TELL YOU IS A CONNECTION I I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY WANTS TO ADD. THE ONLY OTHER THING I'D ADD IS THAT AS WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THE SYSTEMS ACROSS THE BOARD WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE. TO AS WE WERE WORKING ON THE DEVELOPMENT TAKE THE PICTURE. INTO CONSIDERATION BECAUSE WE HAVE MAD WE HAVE THE VERIFICATION HAVE WE HAVE THE SAWS WE HAVE CAL HEARERS AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS IN A WORLD VALUE FOR ALL OF THOSE SYSTEMS. BUT WE ALSO MEANT WE THEN HAVE TO LOOK AT FOR THE BIG PICTURE PERSPECTIVE HOW THEY ALL WORK TOGETHER AT THE END OF THE DAY. MADS IS THAT DATA REPOSITORY SYSTEM FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT HOUSES ALL OF THAT INFORMATION. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE DO ANY MODERNIZATION EFFORTS THAT THOSE SYSTEMS THAT THEN FEED INTO A MAN'S HAVE THE APPROPRIATE IN OUR FACES. OUR SYSTEM DESIGNED THAT WILL HELP -- TO EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY TRANSMIT DATA BACK AND FORTH AND WHEN THERE'S POLICY CHANGES WE HAVE TO THEN BE ABLE TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES IN A SEAMLESS AND EFFICIENT WAY SO THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT HAVING TO WAIT MONTHS ON THE AND FOR A NEW POLICY TO GOING TO A FACT. AS WE MODERNIZE THE SYSTEMS THEN WE CAN MAKE CHANGES IN THE SYSTEMS MORE IN REAL TIME MORE QUICKLY. THAN WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO TODAY JUST BECAUSE OF THE OLD TECHNOLOGY THAT THE SYSTEMS ARE SITTING ON THANK YOU. IT'S HARD IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE WE DON'T HAVE SUCH A SYSTEM ALREADY RIGHT AFTER ALL THESE YEARS -- BUT IT'S SO PROMISING TO HEAR THAT WE'RE MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION.% AND THAT WE REALLY WILL HAVE A CENTRALIZED SYSTEM THE WHOLE OF THE THE THE METS THE METS MON -- IT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT I I THINK THAT BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A COMPLEX CHANGE.

FIVE STATEWIDE AUTOMATED WELFARE SYSTEMS. NOW WE'RE DOWN SAWS. AWARE OF CELLS. WELCOME THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS CHRIS DUDLEY AND I'M WITH THE OFFICE OF SYSTEMS INTEGRATION. AND THIS IS THE CAL SAWS PROPOSAL -- AS YOU KNOW WE'RE CONSOLIDATING THREE SYSTEMS INTO ONE TO MEET ARE FEDERALLY MANDATED TIME FRAME OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND THERE IS ALSO A SPRING FINANCE LETTER FOR ADDITIONAL POSITIONS FOR THE THREE DEPARTMENT CDSS DH CS ON OUR SIDE -- AN EXPANDED ROLE FOR THE STATE PROGRAM DEPARTMENTS AND OUR SITE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CAL SAWS -- I HI AGAIN WOULD SAY THAT YOU HAVE A GOOD SUMMARY IN THE DOCUMENT AND IF THERE ARE NO QUESTIONS OVERALL I'D GO ON TO THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE AGENDA. CENTER RIGHT. I THINK THAT WOULD BE FINE UNLESS SOMEBODY FROM WE HEAR SOMETHING FROM THE PUBLIC BUT THAT WOULD BE FINE. OKAY THE FIRST QUESTION WAS ABOUT THE STAKEHOLDER INPUT AND HOW THAT IS GOING AN UPDATE ON THAT TO AND MEASURES TO ENSURE CONTINUED. ENGAGEMENT AND I WOULD AY THAT THE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS IS WELL UNDER WAY. AND FROM A STATE PERSPECTIVE MAKING GOOD PROGRESS THEY'VE BEEN THREE LARGE GROUP QUARTERLY MEETINGS AND THEN SEVERAL OTHER SMALLER. MEETINGS WITH A CORE GROUP OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY. ARE CURRENTLY SCHEDULED ARE CONTINUING QUARTERLY STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS FOR STATUS UPDATES AND FURTHER DISCUSSION ON VARIOUS TOPICS WE'VE ALSO STARTED SCHEDULING MONTHLY IN DEPTH -- MEETINGS ON SPECIFIC TOPICS OF INTEREST IN PARTICULAR. AND THEN ALSO THE STAKEHOLDERS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN -- PROCUREMENTS FOR PUBLIC FACING TECHNOLOGY LAST WEEK WE HAD A MEETING WHERE WE DISCUSSED THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CONSUMER PORTAL AND MOBILE APP WHERE. THE ADVOCATE AND STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY BROUGHT THERE WERE IS ABLE TO REVIEW THE REQUIREMENTS THAT ALREADY EXIST AND THEN ADD THEIR OWN AND MAKE COMMENTS ON THOSE REQUIREMENTS. NOT WILL BE CONSIDEREDAS WE DEVELOP THE PROCUREMENT. AND THEY'RE ALSO BEING INCLUDED STAKEHOLDERS ARE BEING INCLUDED IN CAL SIZE FUNCTIONAL DESIGN SESSIONS PARTICULARLY FOR THE PUBLIC FACING FUNCTIONALITY AND THOSE WILL BE SCHEDULED. OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS SELECT THEIR INVOLVED IN THE DESIGN. WE CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO DETERMINE THE AGENDAS FOR ALL MEETINGS AND TO DISCUSSION TOPICS FOR THOSE MEETINGS. AND IN ADDITION AS YOU HEARD -- DISTURBING TO SAY THAT WE ARE POSTING ALL RELEVANT DOCUMENTS TO PUBLIC WEBSITES FOR STAKEHOLDER REVIEW AND COMMENT AND QUESTION [inaudible] THANK YOU. THE NEXT QUESTION WAS ABOUT THE FINDINGS OF THE STATE APPLICATION HAVE AND HOW THOSE ARE INFLUENCING DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF CAL SAUCE. I THINK YOU HEARD EARLIER THAT THAT PROJECT IS IN VERY EARLY STAGES AND SO THERE'S AN ASSUMPTION AS THE ANALYSIS AND PLANNING CONTINUES THAT. THAT PROJECT WILL ENGAGE WITH CAL SIZE BOTH IN TERMS OF DESIGN AND ALSO IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE. WONDERFUL THANK YOU [inaudible] NEXT WITNESS. TIGER WOODS BERMAN FINANCE SOMETHING THAT AT THIS TIME THANK YOU. BRENT METZ GRILL A NO COMMENTS ON THIS ISSUE [inaudible] THANK YOU. ALRIGHT LET'S OPEN IT UP TO PUBLIC COMMENT. HI THANK YOU TRACI PATTERSON CALIFORNIA FOOD POLICY ADVOCATES -- I AM PART OF THE GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS THAT HAVE BEEN MEETING REGULARLY BOTH AS OUR ORGANIZATION A PART OF THE ALLIANCE TO TRANSFORM CAL FRESH PARENT VOICES NATIONAL HEALTH WELL PROGRAM WESTERN CENTER -- AND WE ARE REALLY APPRECIATING THE MEETINGS AND BREAK THROUGH THAT HAVE BEEN HAPPENING LATELY THINGS WERE DELAYED BECAUSE OF THE DELAY OF THE SHUT DOWN WE UNDERSTAND THAT AND SO WE HAVE BEEN DIVING INTO SOME MORE IN DEPTH MEETINGS LATELY. APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS KIND OF A FIRST -- WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ACKNOWLEDGED AS WE MOVE THROUGH THIS -- THERE IS ANOTHER ISSUE WILL HERE IN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WE'RE HOPING OF WITH THE PROCESS LEADING TO OUTCOMES AND HOW THAT WORKS TOGETHER BUT YOU KNOW APPRECIATIVE OF THE PROCESS AND TO BE WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE STATE AND COUNTIES ON THIS. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MY CAROL WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WELL WE HAVE AS TRACY MENTIONED WE ARE ALSO PARTICIPATING IN THE SAUCE DECOR WORKER PROCESS -- AND YEAH I THINK IT REALLY HAS PICKED UP STEAM IN THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS -- I THINK WE'RE GETTING MUCH MORE DEEPLY ENGAGED IT'S A MASSIVE UNDERTAKING I WANT TO UNDERSCORE THAT. AND ADD THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF DETAIL BUT THAT I EVERYONE ON OUR SIDE IS LEARNING ABOUT. ABOUT THE PROCESS AND WHAT CAN GAUGE WITHIN HIM WERE HAVING TO KIND OF FOCUS DOWN ON THE AREAS THAT REALLY MATTER MOST TO OUR CLIENTS. I DIDN'T HAVE THE OPTION TO COMMENT ON THE HUB BY I ALSO JUST WANT TO UNDERSCORE THAT. THAT IS ALSO REALLY SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING BUT IT IS IN A REALLY PRELIMINARY STAGE WE HAVEN'T REALLY DUG INTO THE DETAILS OF IT YET. THE PROMISE OF THE HUB COULD REALLY BE SIGNIFICANT THOUGH AND THAT IT COULD REALLY HELP US FINE TUNE AND MAKE BETTER BENEFIT DETERMINATIONS. ACCURATE BENEFIT DETERMINATIONS SO THAT PEOPLE GET THE ASSISTANCE THEY NEED IN A QUICKER MORE A CORRECT FASHION. BUT AGAIN WE'RE AT A VERY EARLY STAGE IT'S A VERY EXCITING TIME ALL THESE KIND OF CHANGES WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT AND WHAT I I WOULD SIGNAL I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE. HAS SENT ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER IS ALREADY NOTED TO KEEP A SHARP BY AND FOCUS ON THIS ISSUE GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FRANK MACKESY TO BE DA I'M HERE TO SUPPORT THE STATE'S REQUEST FOR SUPPORT -- FOR THE PROJECT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE THE TRADITION OF SUCCESS THAT WE'VE HAD WITH SAWS. I THINK IT'S INTERESTING -- MISTER BRAZIER THAT IN THE LIST OF PROJECTS THAT YOU LISTED THAT CREATED SOME CONCERNS IN THE PAST SAUCES NOT BEEN ONE OF THEM IT'S BEEN ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL. AUTOMATION PROJECTS -- IN THE STATE'S HISTORY. TODAY THERE'S ABOUT THIRTEEN MILLION PEOPLE AS WE SIT HERE IN THIS HEARING WHO ARE RECEIVING A VITAL LIFESAVING BENEFIT THAT THEY LARGELY THIS ADMINISTERED THROUGH THAT SYSTEM. AND SO AS WE MIGRATE FROM THREE TO ONE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. THAT STAKEHOLDER COLLABORATION EXISTS IN THE STATE AND THE COUNTIES HAVE ADEQUATE SUPPORT TO CONTINUE THIS TRADITION OF SUCCESS [inaudible] THANK YOU. LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. I DID WANT TO ASK ON PAGE. THIRTY EIGHT I COULD BE A DIFFERENT PAGE BUT THE IT'S TABLE ONE THE RESOURCE REQUEST. DOES THAT BUDGET PICTURE ALL OF REFLECT. THE REQUEST BEING MADE IN THE SPRING FINANCE LETTER. YES VERY GOOD. ALL RIGHT WE WILL BE HOLDING THIS ISSUE OPEN. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. ISSUE NUMBER. SIX IT'S ALSO MINE. ALRIGHT. STAY RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FRANK MCCOURT CWD A SHIP THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS PROPOSAL. COVERAGE TO PLANO IS A PRACTICE ENHANCEMENT EFFORT THAT WAS INITIATED BY THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS. TO MODERNIZE THE WAY WE DO IN THE WAY WE ENGAGE WITH CLIENTS IN THE WELFARE TO WORK PART OF THE CALVERTS PROGRAM. IT'S BASED ON EXCITING EMERGING BRAIN SCIENCE BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE. AND LEVERAGING WHAT WE'RE LEARNING FROM RESEARCH ABOUT ADULT ABOUT HOW ADULTS LEARN THE COW WORKS PROGRAM IS ABOUT TWO DECADES OLD. AND THE POINT OF THE TWO POINT NO EFFORT. IS TO MOVE THE PROGRAM FROM A COMPLIANCE ORIENTED -- ENGAGEMENT PROGRAM WHICH IS HOW IT WAS BUILT. TO ONE THAT'S REALLY BASED ON A MEANINGFUL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CASEWORKERS AND CLIENTS WHERE THEY HELP. DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES WITH BEST FOR THEMSELVES AND WE CREATE PLANS WITH THEM. THAT ARE ACHIEVED THROUGH -- IT HEARD OF GOAL ATTAINMENT THE RESEARCH SAYS IT'S A BETTER WAY TO HELP PEOPLE MOVE ALONG THEIR JOURNEYS. ARM IN ARM PUTTING THIS -- INITIATIVE FOURTH WE'VE PARTNERED WITH THE NATIONAL EXPERT MATHEMATICA POLICY RESEARCH. THAT HAS HELPED US DEVELOP A NUMBER OF TOOLS FOR WORKERS AND SUPERVISORS TO INSTITUTIONALIZE THE LEARNING OF CAL WORKS TO POINT OUT. THOSE TOOLS ARE LARGELY MANUAL AND WERE SEEKING. EXCUSE ME AS FIVE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND ONE TIME TO INTEGRATE THOSE TOOLS INTO THE STATEWIDE AUTOMATED WELFARE SYSTEM. SO THAT IT'S USER FRIENDLY FOR CLIENTS AND FOR WORKERS THAT THE DATA THAT WE GET ABOUT CLIENTS IS INTEGRATED INTO THAT SYSTEM. SO THAT WE CAN TRACK HOW IT'S WORKING WE CAN DO RESEARCH ON HOW IT'S WORKING. AND WE THINK BY EMBEDDING THOSE TOOLS INTO THE STATEWIDE AUTOMATED WELFARE SYSTEM IT WILL REALLY HELP WITH AFFECTS WITH THE CULTURE CHANGE NECESSARY WHICH IS AT THE ROOT OF SUCCESS OF THIS PROJECT BECAUSE SHIFTING. A SYSTEM THAT FOR DECADES HAS BEEN BASED ON COMPLIANCE TO ONE THAT'S NOW BASED ON A DIFFERENT WAY OF ENGAGING IT'S IT'S A MAJOR FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE. AND THIS THIS PROPOSAL WOULD HELP US EFFECTUATE WHAT HAS BANNED -- OF VERY SUCCESSFUL PROJECT TO DATE AND SO WE APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT IT THANK YOU. I BELIEVE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION'S POINT OF VIEW THE ONLY COMMENT WOULD BE THAT THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF WORK AHEAD FOR CAL SAWS -- NOT ONLY THE CONSOLIDATION BUT ALSO OTHER POLICY CHANGES THAT ARE THERE AND SO THIS WOULD THERE HAVE TO BE CLOSE COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE COUNTIES LEGISLATURE GOVERNOR IN TERMS OF PRIORITIZING. THIS WEEK AUTOMATION ABSOLUTELY MORE INTIMATELY WERE INTIMATELY ENGAGED IN THOSE PRIORITIZATION DISCUSSIONS THAT. AS WE MOVE TOWARD CAL SAUCE SO. WE COMPLETELY -- UNDERSTAND AND AND AGREE WITH THAT -- CABBIE OUT [inaudible] WONDERFUL. LET'S OPEN IT UP I'M SORRY -- PARTNER FINANCE. FINANCE TYLER WOULD SIDE JUST ECHO. WHAT MY COLLEAGUE SAID THAT SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER PROPOSALS SUCH AS THESE THE REQUIREMENTS AND CHANGES IN SIZE -- THERE SHOULD BE SOME CONSIDERATION GIVEN THE CAPACITY OF THE CONSORTIUM MAKE THESE CHANGES IN ANY GIVEN FISCAL YEAR. THANK YOU AND BRIAN METZGER LEO NO COMMENTS ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU A PUBLIC COMMENT. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS AGAIN MY CAROL WITH WESTERN CENTER ALONG POVERTY WE SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL FROM WE ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL OF POWERS TWO POINT NO I PREVIOUSLY TESTIFIED IN FRONT OF THIS. SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE MERITS OF THAT -- AND WE'RE WE'RE ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE COUNTIES IN THE DEPARTMENT TO IN FACT CREATE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD. BRING BACK RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT FURTHER POLICY CHANGES THAT WOULD EMBRACE COWART'S TWO POINT OH SO WE WE SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL URGE YOU. TO CONSIDER WHEN THE TIME COMES THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. THIS AUTOMATION PIECE DOES FEEL LIKE A NATURAL PART OF THE CAL WORKS. OUT COMES IN ACCOUNTABILITY REVIEW CALOR -- I WOULD ASK THAT THE ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENT FINANCE IF YOU COULD PLEASE GIVE US YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW. THE TOOLS RELATE TO CAL OR IN YOUR MIND [inaudible] THE TICKET. TIGER WOODS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT I'M THE EXPERT THAT YOU'D WANT TO HEAR FROM REGARDING THE INTERFACE BETWEEN THOSE TWO THINGS CAL OR AND CAL WORKS TWO POINT NOW -- MANIC BUT HEY MISTER MARKER CAM ALL RIGHT MISTER MECCA. THEY'RE THEY'RE INTIMATELY RELATED AND SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE MATERIALS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES HAS PUT TOGETHER ON THE MEASURES THAT WILL BE PART OF THE CAL OR THE CAL WORKS OUT COMES AN ACCOUNTABILITY REVIEW SYSTEM. THERE ARE MEASURES THAT -- LIKE ENGAGEMENT THEIR MEASURES FOR PARTIAL PARTICIPATION THEIR MEASURES FOR THE ACCESS TO SUPPORT OF SERVICES THERE MEASURES RELATED. TO OUR PEOPLE DOING ONCE THEY GET EMPLOYED -- THOSE ARE THINGS THAT ARE NOT PART OF THEY WERE BUILT INTO THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM. THE CALYX TO PLANO APPROACH TO CASE MANAGEMENT IS ALL ABOUT ENGAGEMENT. BUILDING ON PARTIAL PARTICIPATION BUILDING ON GOAL ATTAINMENT SO THAT -- THAT A CLIENT JOURNEY -- TO SELF SUFFICIENCY IS ONE THAT'S BUILT ON ATTAINING GOALS ITS EGGS IT'S EXACTLY HOW. EXACTLY IT'S IT IS LARGELY REFLECTED AND SUPPORTED IN THE TYPES OF MEASURES THAT ARE PART OF CALOR AND THE CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROCESS. THAT IS PART OF THE CALORIMETER SO WE ACTUALLY BELIEVE -- THEY'RE THEY'RE COMPLETELY SYNERGISTIC AND AND NEITHER WILL BE AS SUCCESSFUL BY ITSELF. THEN THEY WILL BE TOGETHER. VERY GOOD THANK YOU. ALRIGHT WE WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION. ISSUE NUMBER. SEVEN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FRANK MECCA AGAIN WITH THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS -- COUNTY WELFARE DEPARTMENTS BY STATUTE WHEN THERE IS A A A NATURAL DISASTER HAVE TWO MAJOR RESPONSIBILITIES ONE IS A MATCH SHELTERING OF DISPLACED PEOPLE AND ONE IS THE ISSUANCE OF EMERGENCY BENEFITS. SO THAT PEOPLE CAN SURVIVE -- WHILE OTHER ADJUSTING TO THEIR THEIR LIFE POST TRAGEDY -- ONE OF THOSE PROGRAMS IS THE DISASTER CALPERS PROGRAM WHICH WE ADMINISTER AND IT'S LARGELY A MANUALLY ADMINISTERED PROGRAM. AND WITH THE REGRETTABLE BUT IT WOULD SEEM TO NEVER DOUBLE INCREASING FREQUENCY OF MASS DISASTERS. WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THAT FOR WORKERS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR CLIENTS THE MANUAL PROCESS OF APPLYING AND TRACKING AND ISSUING BENEFITS FOR DISASTER CAL BRUSH BENEFITS? DIVERTS ATTENTION AWAY FROM HELPING PEOPLE -- GET ACCLIMATED -- TO AN INTERIM EXISTENCE AND SURVIVE -- AS THEY AS THEY DEAL WITH THE WITH THE HORRORS OF THEIR TRAGEDIES WE'VE ALSO FOUND THAT AS NEIGHBORING COUNTIES MOVING TO ASSIST PEOPLE WHO ARE DISPLACED FOR EXAMPLE DURING THE THE BUYERS AND BUTTE COUNTY NEIGHBORING COUNTIES WERE RECEIVING CLIENTS WHO ARE MOVING BECAUSE THERE'S NO PLACE TO LIVE -- THE ABILITY TO TRACK CENTRALLY IN AN AUTOMATED WAY THE THAT THE CLIENTS ENGAGEMENT WITH THIS AFTER BENEFITS WOULD HELP THE RECEIVING COUNTIES UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE FAMILY. AND BE ABLE TO HELP RELOCATE -- AND ASSIST THEM IN SO THIS IS THE NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR GENERAL FUND AT ONE TIME ASK -- IT'S ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION ONCE WE ADD THE FEDERAL FUNDS -- THAT WE BELIEVE IS A REALLY PRUDENT AND NECESSARY COMPONENT TO THE STATE'S A STRATEGY FOR DEALING WITH NATURAL DISASTERS THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. FEATURING GO WITH DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES WE CONCUR COMPLETELY WITH THE PROBLEM THAT MISTER MAC AT DESCRIBE THIS IS AN INTENSELY MANUAL WORK AROUND IT'S UNPREDICTABLE WHEN IT HAPPENS -- IT'S NOT PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET -- SO YOU KNOW MY ABILITY TO COMMENT TOO FAR IS IS LIMITED -- IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING AS WELL THIS IS A ONE ONE TIME I REQUEST FOR FUNDING -- DEBT THAT WOULD -- IN A IN A TIME OF EMERGENCY GIVE PEOPLE CLEARANCE STANDARD UNDERSTANDING OF OF WHAT THEY NEED TO DO AND HOW TO GO ABOUT DOING IT. AN INCREASE THE ABILITY TO DO THE REPORTING THAT'S REQUIRED TO THE FADS -- AS YOU KNOW AT THE SAME COMMENTS MADE ON THE PRIOR ITEM SAWS HAS A BIG LIST -- AND THIS IS PROBABLY ONE THAT SWIRLY A PRIORITIZATION WITHIN THE LIST. THANK YOU YOU WOULD TEND TO AGREE NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. TIGER WOODS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AGAIN SIMILAR COMMENTS TO THE PROPOSAL BEFORE THIS THAT IF THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER SAYS SAYS A PROPOSAL -- TO GIVE DUE CONSIDERATION THE CAPACITY TO BUILD THESE AUTOMATION CHANGES IN THE SAUCE AND BUDGET YEAR. THE MANAGER PACKAGE TO SAY ON THAT POINT. UNDERSCORE THAT THE CAPACITY OF THE CONSORTIA IS A REALLY RELEVANT. FACTOR WE ARE THE CONSORTIA OUR COUNTY -- STAFFING MANAGERS AND SO WE HAVE AS VESTED. EQUALLY AS VESTED IN A IN A RATIONAL ACHIEVABLE PRIORITIZATION BECAUSE BECAUSE THAT IS COUNTY STAFF THAT ACTUALLY MAKE UP THE CONSORTIUM VERY GOOD. THANK YOU MISTER THOMAS WE DIDN'T MEAN TO IMPLY OTHERWISE. FOR THE RECORD. YOU. LA AND PRIVATE SCALIA NO COMMENTS ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU. A PUBLIC COMMENT. BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. ALL RIGHT WE WILL LEAVE THIS ISSUE OPEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ISSUE NUMBER. EIGHT SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LNGUAGE RELATED TO QUALITY APPLICANT CLIENT EXPERIENCE. YES HI TRACY PATTERSON CALIFORNIA FOOD POLICY ADVOCATES -- HERE TO PRESENT ON SORT OF A FOLLOW UP A LOT OF A LOT OF THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN COMING UP TODAY WITHIN THE STAKEHOLDER GROUP THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING WITH THE CAL SAWS DEVELOPMENT. ON THIS HAS BEEN A GOOD PROCESS IT'S BEEN OPENING UP AGAIN WE REALLY APPRECIATE SORT OF THIS HISTORIC NATURE AND ALSO YOU KNOW SOMEOF THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE GOVERNANCE OF THE SYSTEM BECAUSE IT'S A COUNTY SYSTEM. BUT ALSO ADMINISTERED BY THE CONSORTIUM WHICH ARE THE COUNTIES BUT OUR CALLUSES WITH OVERSIGHT FROM THE STATE SO IN BEING STAKEHOLDERS TRYING TO ENGAGE WITH THOSE VARIOUS. OTHER SERVE GOVERNMENT STAKEHOLDERS WHAT WE LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT PROCESS LEADS TO THE OUTCOMES THAT WE REALLY WANT FOR OUR CLIENTS WHICH IS. AN EASIER EXPERIENCE A DIGNIFIED EXPERIENCE AWAY TO GET ENROLLED WITH SUCCESS TO NOT DROP OFF IT POINTS OF OF PAIN IN THE TRANSITION WHICH FOR CAL FOR US CAN OFTEN BE THE VERIFICATION. INTERVIEWS TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SYSTEM REALLY GUIDES PEOPLE FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END BECAUSE WE KNOW AN APPLICATION IS NOT ACTUALLY AN ENROLLMENT NECESSARILY YOU HAVE TO HAVE. YOU'RE REALLY STARTING THE BEGINNING THE AWARENESS OF THE PROGRAM YOU NEED GOOD WORD OF MOUTH YOU NEED A COMMUNITY THAT REALLY TRUST THAT THE SYSTEM WORKS TO ENROLL -- THEN THERE'S THE APPLICATION GETTING VERIFIED GETTING ROLLED AND THEN STAYING ENROLLED PEOPLE HAVE TO RECERTIFY WE DON'T WANT THEM TO DROP OFF. AND SO AS WE'RE WORKING WITH THE STAKEHOLDER GROUP. WHAT WE'RE HOPING IS THAT WE CAN THEN HAVE SOME I'M SORT OF SIMILAR TO THE CAL OR PROCESS SOME ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT THROUGH THAT PROCESS TO MAKE SURE WEGET THOSE OUTCOMES? AND SO ALL THAT WERE REQUESTING AND WE'RE WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS BEEN CONSULTING THE COUNTY IS -- THE ADMINISTRATION JUST TO MAKE SURE WE GET THIS LANGUAGE RIGHT -- AND SO THERE ARE YOU KNOW SOME CHANGES TO THE LANGUAGE THAT'S IN THIS AGENDA THAT WERE WORKING ON BOTH TO CLARIFY WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REPORTING ON THE PROGRESS AND THE OUTCOMES WE WERE TALKING ABOUT FORMAL REPORT. WE'RE HAPPY WITH THAT BEING AN UPDATE TO THE LEGISLATURE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ALL ENGAGED IN INVOLVED -- AND MAKING SURE THAT YOU KNOW WITHIN TECHNOLOGY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT WITH AN EXISTING TECHNOLOGY OR MINIMIZING THE BURDENS OF THE ENROLLMENT PROCESS AND THAT THAT IS SORT OF THE GUIDING STAR. OF THESE WORK GROUPS BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S THIRTY FOUR DIFFERENT WORK GROUPS NOW WE CAN'T ALL BE IN ALL PLACES AT THAT TIME AND SO WHAT WE'RE HOPING THROUGH THIS IS THAT. AS CHANGES ARE MADE AS I. T. DECISIONS ARE MADE THAT WERE ASKING IS THIS DECISION ACTUALLY REDUCING THE BURDEN FOR THE CLIENT IT IS BEING DONE IN FOR MY BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE. UNDERSTANDING MANY PEOPLE COMING TO THESE PROGRAMS ARE EXPERIENCING POVERTY TRAUMA A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES AND SO THE COSTS SERVE COGNITIVE LOAD BEHAVIORAL ATTENTION THE ABILITY TO NAVIGATE COMPLEX SYSTEMS CAN BE MUCH HARDER FOR THESE CLIENTS. AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROCESS LEADS TO THE OUTCOMES -- WE RECOGNIZE THAT THAT CAN BE CHALLENGE CHALLENGING TO PUT INTO STATUTORY LANGUAGE AND SO WE'RE WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN HAVE PROCESS AND OUTCOMES THAT LEAD TO WHAT WE ALL WANT AT THE END OF THIS MULTI YEAR PROCESS THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. AGAIN PETER BANKER FROM FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES WE DON'T HAVE OBJECTIONS TO CODIFYING OF THIS I THINK WE'D HAVE TO MINOR COMMENTS THAT AS SHE ALLUDED TO LIKE A GUIDING STAR -- IT'S CURRENTLY WRITTEN AS A MANDATE THAT THE SYSTEM SHALL WE THINK MAYBE EXPRESSING IT AS A GOAL WOULD BE HELPFUL. AND THERE'S A A REQUIREMENT IN AS THE DRAFT ON PAGE FORTY FIVE ABOUT AT A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE TWICE A YEAR. AS WE TALKED ABOUT A LOT TODAY -- WE'RE TRYING TO MOVE AWAY FROM REPORTS TO THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE THERE'S A LONG FORMAL REVIEW PROCESS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. AND SIMPLY MAINTAINING AND MAKING AVAILABLE ALL OF THE INFORMATION DOCUMENTATION AND NOTES ON OUR PUBLIC FACING WEBSITES SO THAT WERE FULLY TRANSPARENT NOT JUST TO THE LEGISLATURE BUT ANYBODY THAT MAYBE COULDN'T ATTEND A MEETING OR SO FORTH SO. WITH THOSE TWO MINOR SUGGESTIONS AGAIN WE DON'T HAVE CONCERNS AT ALL WE WERE SUPPORTIVE. THE END OF THE DAY WE'RE ALL HERE TO SERVE CLIENTS AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK FOR CLIENTS THERE'S NO POINT [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] FIND. TIGER WOODS HER TO FINANCE NO FURTHER COMMENT AT THIS TIME. HELLO PRIME IT'S CURLY -- NO COMMENTS ON THIS ISSUE PUBLIC COMMENT.

THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. A RITE. OF ALTHOUGH I RECOGNIZE THAT -- HAVING THE OF RETURNING. A HAVING THE INFORMATION ON ON THE WEBSITE AND MAKING A PUBLIC IS A GOOD THING I I WOULD ASK THAT IT BE SHARED WITH THE WITH THE STAFF WITH THE LEGISLATURE. I THINK THAT WOULD BE A GOOD THING -- AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOUR YOUR FEEDBACK IS THAT YOU LIKE THE PROPOSAL. I I WOULD ASK THAT THE ALLIANCE WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON SPECIFIC EDITS TO THE LANGUAGE -- AND I'D LIKE. I'D LIKE TO SEE THE CLOSE VERSION TWO FINAL VERSION OF SUBMITTED. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE -- BY NEXT WEEK. WE CAN OKAY. OKAY AND WITH THAT WILL LEAVE THIS ISSUE OPEN THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION RIGHT ISSUE. NINE ON STATE WHAT FINGERPRINT IMAGING SYSTEM. AGAIN PETER REGULAR THAT APARTMENT ON THIS ONE THIS IS BASICALLY CLEAN UP LANGUAGE TO ACTIONS -- DONE IN IN PRIOR BUDGET CYCLES WE'VE ENDED THE USE OF THE STATEWIDE FINGERPRINT IMAGING SYSTEM. IN CALIFORNIA THERE WERE A COUPLE PLACES IN THE CODE THAT WERE MESSED WHERE WE HAD REFERENCES TO IT THAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO REPLACE -- AND SO THAT'S REALLY ALL THIS LANGUAGE DOES IT'S CLEAN UP FOR THAT -- I'D BE REMISS NOT TO MENTION THAT -- THE DECOMMISSIONING AS WELL SO JUST WANT TO SAY THAT FOR THE RECORD BUT THE ITEM BEFORE YOU IS THE TRAILER BILL AND IT'S SIMPLY CODE CLEAN UP. WHERE WE MISSED A FEW REFERENCES TO THE OLD SYSTEM? THANK YOU [inaudible] NEXT WITNESS. TIGER WOODS PARMA FINANCE NO COMMENT.

OF MY NAME IS -- REBEKAH STILLING I'M THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF WITH THE OFFICE OF SYSTEMS INTEGRATION AND MY ROLE -- WITH OSIIS THE PROJECT DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA AUTOMATED RESPONSE AN ENGAGEMENT SYSTEM. TO MY RIGHT IS MY COLLEAGUE KEVIN GAINS -- SOCIAL SERVICES AND OSI -- UNDER THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY WORK TOGETHER ON THIS -- IMPORTANT SYSTEM FOR CHILD WELFARE WORKERS AND AND FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. OF THIS STUFF THE SUMMARY AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL IS ACCURATE AND WILL WELL WRITTEN -- I'LL ADD A FEW MORE THINGS TO IT OVER THIS PAST YEAR IN ADDITION TO WORKING ON ONE THING AT A TIME WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON IMPROVING OUR CAPABILITIES AND OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ENTIRETY OF THE SYSTEM -- WHICH INCLUDED -- AN EFFORT TO DOCUMENT WHAT WE CALL THE BLUEPRINT OF THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM THAT'S GOING TO BE HELPFUL IN FUTURE YEARS BECAUSE IT WILL. GIVE US A CHANCE TO FOCUS ON THE SPECIFICS OF THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -- AND HELP US WITH OUR FOCUS ON THE USER CENTERED DESIGN AND USER RESEARCH ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION TO THAT THIS PAST YEAR WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT OTHER WAYS TO ACCELERATE THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS EVENTUALLY. I THINK WHEN WE FIRST STARTED THIS PROJECT WE WERE A LITTLE NAIVE ABOUT HOW TO DO -- AGILE PROJECTS AND A LITTLE BIT NAIVE ON THE APPROACH TO BUILDING THIS SYSTEM -- USING CUSTOM DEVELOPMENT APPROACH AND THAT WAS WHAT PRECIPITATED THE RECOMMENDATION FROM A SEE WHY I HAVE TO DO ONE THING AT A TIME IN OTHER WORDS GET BETTER AT COMPLETING SOMETHING ALL THE WAY THROUGH DON'T START TOO MANY THINGS AT ONCE AND SO WE'VE TAKEN THAT. ADVICE TO HEART AND WE WANT TO CONTINUE THAT APPROACH INTO THE NEXT YEAR -- AND AND ALLOW US -- TO SHOW AND DELIVER THE THING THE VALUE -- ESPECIALLY THE VALUE TO THE CHILD WELFARE WORKERS AS WELL AS THE FAMILIES. SO I'LL I'LL STOP AT THAT OBSERVATION AND AND FIGHT ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS IF YOU LIKE. THANK YOU [inaudible] NEXT WITNESS. KEVIN GAINES SOCIAL SERVICES -- JUST AS WELL ABOVE BY WAY OF BACKGROUND -- THE THE CHILD WELFARE SERVICES CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM HAS BEEN IN PLACE SINCE -- DEPLOYED TALK COUNTY SINCE -- NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT STARTED AS A PROJECT IN ABOUT NINETEEN NINETY TWO AND REPRESENTS -- THE STATE OF THE ART FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE AND SO WHILE THERE IS A DIRE NEED -- TO TO TO REPLACE AND AND CONTINUE TO IMPROVE ON WORKERS ABILITY TO ADD TO IT TO ACCESS INFORMATION AND DISPENSE INFORMATION AND TRADE INFORMATION TO TO MAKE SURE THEY EVERYONE IS COLLABORATING TOWARD THE RIGHT OUTCOMES FOR KIDS AND FAMILIES -- THE THAT THAT HAS BEEN SLOW GOING AND WE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN -- LONG LONG COMING. AND AND WE BELIEVE THAT THAT IT'S WE AGREE WITH THE THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS TO TO STEP BACK. FIGURE OUT -- AS A PUBLIC SECTOR ENTITY HOW TO HOW TO BUILD SOFTWARE IN THE WAYS THAT -- THAT PRIVATE INDUSTRY DOES BUT IN A IN A WAY THAT'S TRANSPARENT AS OPPOSED TO THE WAY PRIVATE INDUSTRY IS NOT. IN AND AND SO -- THAT'S WE KNEW IN THE BEGINNING WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS AS A AS A AS A POSSIBLE TRANSITION -- OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT IT WAS GONNA TAKES A MAJOR -- ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES AND AND AND NEW PARADIGMS AND SO WE'RE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT. I GUESS MY MY MY MESSAGES WHILE WE WE DON'T WANT TO THROW THE BABY OUT WITH THE BATHWATER -- YOU KNOW MISTAKES IN EXECUTION DOESN'T MEAN THAT THAT WERE THAT WERE STANDING ON A BAD IDEA WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO TO REFINE. OUR PROCESSES AND AND REFINED. THE THE AND AND REDEFINE THE TYPES OF PEOPLE WHO WERE DOING THIS WORK AND KEEP UP WITH WITH TECHNOLOGY AND THE STAFF WAS SO -- WE WANT TO WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO RELY ON EXPERTS -- THE WHO WERE COMING FROM PRIVATE INDUSTRY THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN CONSULTING WITH -- WITH HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY AND WITH OUR NEW ADVISER OF MIKE WILKENING FOR FOR DIGITAL INNOVATION WE WANT. TO CONTINUE -- TO TO TO TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS TO OUR OUR PROCESS IS TO TO GET BETTER AT DELIVERING SOFTWARE WHETHER IT'S VIA OTHER AND AND PLATFORM OR CUSTOM BUILT -- SO WE IT ALL IT'S IT'S BABY STEPS WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO ADD TO IT TO GROW MATURE SO WE WOULD LIKE -- TO TO TO HAVE ROOM TO DO THAT.

YES WELL HOW COME THE THE THE TIME LINES HAVE SHIFTED IN -- AND WE AS SOME FRIEND MENTIONED A MINUTE AGO WE'RE WORKING ON A NEW SPECIAL PROJECT REPORT -- AND IN WORKING ON THIS THE BLUEPRINT THAT I REFERENCED AND THE MODIFICATIONS TO OUR DEVELOPMENT APPROACH. WE INTEND TO BUILD OUT A NEW -- A PROJECTION ON SCHEDULING COST AND THE THE EXPECTATION -- IN THAT CONTEXT WOULD BE THAT IT'LL IT'LL STILL -- TAKE US SOME ADDITIONAL NUMBERS OF YEARS AND I WOULD GUESS ABOUT FOUR AT THIS POINT FOUR MORE YEARS TO FINISH THIS UP THAT'S A GAS. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT TO SAY THAT THE PROJECT -- USING THIS APPROACH AGILE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT THAT OLOGY WILL -- CONTINUE ON INTO THE FUTURE AS THE SYSTEM LIVES SO IT WILL -- IT'LL REQUIRE ONGOING FUNDING FOR MAINTAINING AND OPERATING IT WITH THE AMBITION THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENHANCE IT AND MODIFY IT AS IT DOES. SO -- WANT WHEN I TYPICALLY THINK OF A PROJECT TIMELINE I THINK OF WHEN YOU GET TO FULL IMPLEMENTATION. AND THEY'LL BE A TIME THAT WE ARE ABLE TO TURN OFF THE CMS SYSTEM THE LEGACY SYSTEM. AND A TIME WHEN WHEN ALL -- CHILD WELFARE WORKERS ARE UTILIZING THE NEW SYSTEM BUT THEN THEY'LL BE SUBSEQUENT PERIODS OF YOU KNOW THEY'LL THEY'LL BE ONGOING ENHANCEMENTS MADE TO THE SYSTEM AFTER THAT I THINK. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH STATE LEGACY SYSTEMS IS THAT -- WE WE WORK REALLY HARD WE GET THE PROJECT DONE FOR BETTER OR WORSE WITH THE WITH A LARGE -- COMPLEMENT OF UNMET NEEDS AND THEN THE SYSTEMS ARE NOT INVESTED IN ANYMORE SO THAT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A SYSTEM AS KEVIN INDICATED THAT WAS DEPLOYED IN. NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT VERY LITTLE IN TERMS OF MODERNIZING THE TECHNOLOGY VIRTUALLY NOTHING IS TAKING PLACE IN THAT SYSTEM ALL THE TIME. LOTS OF POLICY REQUIREMENTS OF WITHIN BECAUSE YOU KNOW REQUIREMENTS -- HAVE COME ABOUT BUT NOT ANY MODERNIZATION SO. THIS SYSTEM -- THE PART OF THE DEMONSTRATION PRODUCT UP PROP ASPECT OF THIS SYSTEM IS. LET'S GET GOOD AT UNDERSTANDING ARCHITECTURE IN CREATING A SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS US TO ENHANCE IN OVERTIME AND THEN LET'S KEEP. AN ORGANIZATION IN PLACE ONGOING THAT WILL MAINTAIN AND OPERATE THAT SYSTEM FOR YEARS TO COME SO THEY'LL NEVER AGAIN GET OUTDATED -- AND THE WILL NEVER AGAIN HAVE TO GIVE GIVE UP. BUT THAT. THAT'S A SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT MINDSET AND DIFFERENT SKILL SET I THINK THEM WHAT WE ORIGINALLY UNDERSTOOD FULL ANDTHAT'S WHY WE'RE SPENDING THIS ADDITIONAL TIME INVESTING IN THAT -- THE S. P. R. THAT WE FINISH UP -- AND AND DELIVER THIS MID SUMMER WILL ALSO BE -- ACCOMPANIED BY A FEDERAL APPROVAL. PLANNING DOCUMENT AS WELL AND WE WILL PROJECT THAT THE COST TO GET TO THE POINT OF COMPLETING FOR REPLACEMENT OF THE CMS SYSTEM -- AND IT'LL BE A PLACEHOLDER AMOUNTS FOR SUBSEQUENT TO THAT BUT BUT WE'LL TRY TO GIVE SOME RELATIVE ORDER OF MAGNITUDE OF TIME AND MONEY AND THAT S. P. R.. WONDERFUL IT ARE ARE YOU WHAT KIND OF FEEDBACK ARE YOU GETTING FROM COUNTY. STAFF AND MANAGERS. OF THE ENTIRE PROJECT IN THE THE FUNCTIONALITY THUS FAR YEAH WE WE HAVE. THE BENEFIT OF OF COUNTY -- ENGAGEMENT VERY ACTIVELY IN THIS PROJECT THEY THERE ARE COUNTY -- CONSULTANTS THAT ARE PART OF THE PROJECT TEAM THEIR EMBEDDED WITH US AND WORK WITH US EVERYDAY ON DEVELOPMENT OF REQUIREMENTS DEVELOPMENT OF CLARITY AROUND -- BUSINESS PROCESSES BUSINESS PRACTICES WE ALSO HAVE A COMPLEMENT COUNTIES THAT -- ARE WHAT WE REFER TO AS THE CORE COUNTY GROUP THEY'RE THEY'RE COUNTIES THAT HAVE VOLUNTEERED TO BE. OUR FEEDBACK LOOP ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF VARIOUS ASPECTS AND YOU CAN SEE IN THE REPORT WE'VE IMPLEMENTED A FEW THINGS AND THOSE -- THOSE COUNTIES ARE ARE UBER -- TESTERS UBER USERS AND THEY GIVE US THAT FEEDBACK. ON HOW TO IMPROVE OUR ENHANCE THINGS SO -- AND THEN PART OF OUR EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP TEAM OF THE PROJECT INCLUDES THE DELEGATION OF AN INDIVIDUAL WHOSE NAME IS WENDY CHRISTIAN -- AND SHE COMES FROM CWD A HA AND AND PARTICIPATES ON OUR OUR TWICE WEEKLY LEADERSHIP TEAM MEETING SHE LEADS THE COUNTY STAFF ON THE PROJECT SO. KEVIN MYSELF AND WENDY REPRESENT THE THREE GOVERNANCE -- POINTS OF THE PROJECT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT ALL OF THOSE VOICES ARE HEARD. OUR INITIAL FEEDBACK FROM COUNTIES -- HAS BEEN -- APPRECIATIVE OF THE PROCESS OF INCLUDING THEM THEY'VE BEEN VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE OF THE FOCUS OF USING USER RESEARCH USER CENTERED DESIGN -- THAT'S AN IMPORTANT -- ASPECT OF CREATING ON THE NEW SYSTEM BECAUSE YOU NEED TO TO REALLY ACTUALLY SEE WHAT THEY DO AND ACTUALLY PARTICIPATE IN A IN A VISIONING PUT IT THAT WAY SESSION OF HOW TO GET THINGS DONE -- BETTER SO FOR EXAMPLE AGAIN JUST GIVE YOU A QUICK EXAMPLE NOT TAKE UP TOO MUCH MORE OF YOUR TIME BUT ONE WHEN WE SAT DOWN WITH PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE PROGRAM AREA ON THE SOCIAL SERVICES SIDE AND THE COUNTY USERS. AND WE SAID HOW DO WE IMPROVE THIS PROCESS AND RESOURCE FAMILY APPLICATION IS AN EGG IS THE EXAMPLE I'M THINKING OF EVERYBODY WAS SAYING IT TAKES TWO HUNDRED AND TEN DAYS NOW ON AVERAGE FOR AN APPLICATION TO GO THROUGH. IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING CLOSER TO WHAT IS IT. ONE ONE SIXTY OR NINETY NINETY SORRY HOW NEW IS A LOT SHORTER IT SHOULD BE CLOSER TO NINETY AND SO -- THE PROCESS WE GO THROUGH IS TO SAY OKAY LET'S MAP OUT HOW IT IS AND THEN WE LOOK TOGETHER AND THE COUNTIES BECOME IMPORTANT FEEDBACK LOOP HERE. TO SAY COULD WE DO ATTRACT THIS PROCESS COULD WE LEAPFROG OVER THIS THIS -- DEPENDENCY HERE AND PICK IT UP LATER SO THERE'S A LOT OF BUSINESS PROCESS REVIEW AN ADDITION TO JUST HOW THE SYSTEM WILL ACTUALLY FUNCTION. AND WE CAN'T DO THAT BUSINESS PROCESS REVIEW WITHOUT COUNTY ENGAGEMENT BECAUSE WOULD PROBABLY MESS UP -- WE WOULD MAKE A AN ASSUMPTION THAT THEY DON'T NEED TO MEET WITH CLIENTS SECOND YOU KNOWING SAVE TIME DON'T MEET WITH THE CLIENTS -- THAT WOULD BE WRONG ALRIGHT SO -- COUNTY PARTICIPATION IN THAT AS WELL AS SOCIAL SERVICES PROGRAM PARTICIPATION IS IMPORTANT. THAT ACTIVE PARTICIPATION. IS TAKES A LOT MORE TIME THAN PEOPLE GOING INTO A ROOM AND WRITING REQUIREMENTS FOR SYSTEM AND THROWING IT OVER THE WALL -- IT JUSTDOES AND BUT IT IT'LL END UP WITH A BETTER RESULT. AND THE THE GETTING USED TO LISTENING TO EACH OTHER AND CARING ABOUT EACH OTHER'S A BIG PART OF OF WHAT ULTIMATELY THIS PROJECT IS DESIGNED TO DO. ANDI THINK THE END RESULT IS GOING TO BE SO MUCH BETTER I THINK SO -- WONDERFUL -- YES MOST FRAZIER. I SINCE THE YOUR FRUSTRATION ON FROM NINETY TWO TO NINETY AND THEN NINETY EIGHT NOW I'VE. I GET IT -- I THINK THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE AND WE LOOK AT FUTURE GOALS TO GO FOR THAT WE HAVE AN INDEXING. ON A BUDGET INCREASE EVERY YEAR TO BE ABLE. TO ACCOMMODATE OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE OF PUTTING FORTH I THINK IT ACTUALLY WOULD BE A MONEY SAVER -- RATHER THAN REVAMPING THE WHOLE PROGRAM OR SIT SITUATION REPORT. SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE TO BE. MAYBE -- OF COLLABORATION WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND AND AND LEGISLATION TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT WOULD BE. TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT PROCESS IS AN ONGOING UPGRADE YES GOING FORWARD I THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE. BUSINESS THE PRIVATE SECTOR DOES IT -- I DON'T SEE WHY WE SHOULD BE. DOING THE SAME THING I APOLOGIZE FOR TWENTY YEARS OF OF OF WAITING. AND I APPRECIATE ALL OF THE AGENCIES WILLINGNESS. TO ADVANCE TO SERVICE THE PEOPLE THAT WE REPRESENT. HI I SEE THAT ONGOING MESSAGE GOING FORWARD HOW WE CAN BETTER SERVE THE PEOPLE THAT WE REPRESENT NIGHT I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR THAT IT'S NO. USE FACE OF GOVERNMENT WELL AS ACTUALLY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. THE PEOPLE THAT WE REPRESENT -- NEED YOUR HELP AND THE BETTER THAT WE CAN SERVE YOU CONSERVE THEM ACTUALLY HELPS US ALSO IN OUR OR WAY OF REPRESENTING SO -- LOOKING FOR DOOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO AND HOW WE CAN ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT SOMETHING THEM.

ON TIME -- WITHIN SCOPE A AN WITHIN BUDGET A AND NOW WE'RE IN A CRITICAL PHASE AS WE JUST. A NOTICE IN THE PRIOR PROJECT OF MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO CONTINUE THE MAINTENANCE AND OPERATION. I AM GOING FORTH -- WITH THE PRODUCT THAT IS HIGHLY CONFIGURABLE MEANING THAT WE HAVE A A A PROCESS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO MAKE CHANGES TO IT. AS CHANGES OCCUR DUE TO BUY THEIR STATUTORY CHANGES IN ANY OF THE PROGRAMS. OR NEW PROGRAMS MAY BE ON THE HORIZON -- OR ANYTHING THAT IS COURT COURT ORDERED ON A THAT WE HAVE TO COMPLY WITH -- WE NOW HAVE A SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS US. TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES AND NOT WAIT YEARS -- FOR TO BE WILL IMPLEMENT AND HAVE A PROCESS. WHERE WE CAN ULTIMATELY REACH THE AW COME OF THAT OUR ENTIRE PROCESSES IN EVERYBODY ENGAGE WITH IT? IS IS WORKING TOWARDS AND THAT IS THE BUT TIMELY LEGALLY CORRECT DECISION. IS WHAT WE WANT TO GET TO WHEN WHEN THEY GET THERE THE FIRST TIME THAT WE GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS. AND WE BELIEVE ACMS.
