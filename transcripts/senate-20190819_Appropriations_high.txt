THE COSTS OF THE LEGISLATION ARE SIGNIFICANT INCLUDING RECURRING COSTS OF TEN TO FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. AND SIGNIFICANTLY A ONE TIME COST OF ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AS A HUNDRED AND TWELVE THOUSAND TRANSFER CREMINS WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE REVIEWED FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE NEW REQUIREMENT. THESE COSTS ARE NOT COVERED BY THE STATE OR COULD THEY BE SUPPORTED BY ONE TIME RESERVE SUPPORT INCREASING TUITION. AND THAT'S NOT COUNTING THE COST OF DISLOCATION FOR THE DEPARTMENTS AND AFFILIATED PERSONAL NOT INCLUDED IN THE BILL. TO THE REALLOCATION OF UNITS INTO ONLY THE FOR SPECIFIED AREAS TO FIND IN THE LEGISLATION.
