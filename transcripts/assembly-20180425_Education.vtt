PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER FOR THIRTY

00:25:40.438 --> 00:25:42.173
FOUR YEARS.

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.643
.

00:25:44.709 --> 00:25:46.511
SOMEONE WHO VALUES EDUCATION AND

00:25:46.578 --> 00:25:48.513
ALL THE CHOICES THAT THERE ARE

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:50.348
IN EDUCATION.

00:25:50.415 --> 00:25:52.550
SOMEONE WHO REALIZES THAT NOT

00:25:52.617 --> 00:25:54.653
ONE SIZE FITS ALL WHEN IT COMES

00:25:54.719 --> 00:25:55.587
TO EDUCATION SOMEONE WHO

00:25:55.654 --> 00:25:57.622
BELIEVES.

00:25:57.689 --> 00:25:59.324
THAT THAT PARENTS AND STUDENTS

00:25:59.391 --> 00:26:00.892
SHOULD HAVE A CHOICE.

00:26:00.959 --> 00:26:02.494
AND HOW THEY EDUCATE THEIR

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:04.629

00:26:04.696 --> 00:26:06.464

NINE YEARS.

00:26:13.471 --> 00:26:15.573
SO I THINK THAT MEANS THAT MY

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.108
PARENTS WERE WILLING TO.

00:26:17.175 --> 00:26:20.278

03:21:46.360 --> 03:21:47.161
WITH HOME SCHOOLING.

03:21:47.228 --> 03:21:49.096
AND.

03:21:49.163 --> 03:21:50.932
IT THIS BILL IS NOT AN ATTEMPT.

03:21:50.998 --> 03:21:54.936
TO.

03:21:55.002 --> 03:21:57.071
ANYWAY ATTACK HOME SCHOOLING.

03:21:57.138 --> 03:21:59.307
AT ALL.

03:21:59.373 --> 03:22:01.108
A IT IS NOT AN INTENT.

03:22:01.175 --> 03:22:02.310
SOLVE A PROBLEM WITH HOME

03:22:02.376 --> 03:22:06.714
SCHOOLING.

03:22:06.781 --> 03:22:08.115
SO I GUESS WHAT IS THAT WHAT IS

03:22:08.182 --> 03:22:09.150
THE POINT OF THE BILL THEN WE'RE

03:22:09.217 --> 03:22:09.484
GOING TO BE.

03:22:09.550 --> 03:22:12.053
COLLECTING MORE INFORMATION

03:22:12.119 --> 03:22:12.286
ABOUT.

03:22:12.353 --> 03:22:13.621
THE.

03:22:13.688 --> 03:22:14.856
THE NATURE.

03:22:14.922 --> 03:22:18.659
OF OF EACH INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL ON.

03:22:18.726 --> 03:22:19.760
AND WHAT USE IS GOING TO BE MADE

03:22:19.827 --> 03:22:21.496
ABOUT INFORMATION.

03:22:21.562 --> 03:22:23.464
IN MY EFFORT TO.

03:22:23.531 --> 03:22:26.100
TO LOOK AT WHAT WE DO AND WHAT

03:22:26.167 --> 03:22:27.101
WE DON'T DO. IN THE STATE OF

03:22:27.168 --> 03:22:28.102
CALIFORNIA.

03:22:28.169 --> 03:22:30.671
I.

03:22:30.738 --> 03:22:31.105
WAS LOOKED SOMEWHAT.

03:22:31.172 --> 03:22:31.672
.

03:22:31.739 --> 03:22:34.308
BUT.

03:22:34.375 --> 03:22:36.878
SOMEWHAT SURPRISED BY THE FACT

03:22:36.944 --> 03:22:39.080
THAT WE HAVE NO RECORD AT ALL

03:22:39.146 --> 03:22:40.448
ACTUALLY.

03:22:40.515 --> 03:22:41.983
OF NUMBERS

03:22:42.049 --> 03:22:43.684
OF OUR PARENTS

03:22:43.751 --> 03:22:45.686
WHO HOME SCHOOL THEIR CHILDREN

03:22:45.753 --> 03:22:47.121
I I BELIEVE THAT EVEN IN THE

03:22:47.188 --> 03:22:48.823
STAFF ANALYSIS.

03:22:48.890 --> 03:22:50.591
IN THE COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES THE

03:22:50.658 --> 03:22:52.059
NUMBER THAT IS PRESENTED THERE

03:22:52.126 --> 03:22:54.495
IS IS A NUMBER THAT IN MY

03:22:54.562 --> 03:22:56.030
UNDERSTANDING.

03:22:56.097 --> 03:22:57.798
IS ONLY.

03:22:57.865 --> 03:22:59.700
A SORT OF EXASPERATED IS ONLY

03:22:59.767 --> 03:23:01.502
JUST

03:23:01.569 --> 03:23:03.337
TAKEN OUT OF THE DATA.

03:23:03.404 --> 03:23:04.572
BECAUSE THERE AND I HAVE RIGHT

03:23:04.639 --> 03:23:06.407
HERE.

03:23:06.474 --> 03:23:09.076
THE AFFIDAVIT FORM.

03:23:09.143 --> 03:23:11.245
PARENTS FILL OUT AND NO WHERE ON

03:23:11.312 --> 03:23:13.814
THIS FORUM IS THERE ANYWHERE TO

03:23:13.881 --> 03:23:16.384
PUT. THAT THEY ARE HOME SCHOOL.

03:23:16.450 --> 03:23:18.486
IT ONLY SHOWS THAT THERE ARE.

03:23:18.553 --> 03:23:20.721
IN A PRIVATE SCHOOL.

03:23:20.788 --> 03:23:24.191
SO WE DO NOT HAVE. ANY.

03:23:24.258 --> 03:23:25.726
RELIABLE NUMBER.

03:23:25.793 --> 03:23:27.528
AT ALL.

03:23:27.595 --> 03:23:28.596
OF HOW MANY.

03:23:28.663 --> 03:23:30.631
PARENTS OR HOW MANY YOUNG

03:23:30.698 --> 03:23:32.633
PEOPLE ARE HOME SCHOOL.

03:23:32.700 --> 03:23:35.536
SO THAT IS WHY I SAID YEAH IN

03:23:35.603 --> 03:23:37.471
YOUR IN ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION.

03:23:37.538 --> 03:23:39.140
TO BE COGNIZANT OF WHAT THIS

03:23:39.206 --> 03:23:40.975
BILL.

03:23:41.042 --> 03:23:43.778
TRIES TO DO AND DOESN'T DO.

03:23:43.844 --> 03:23:46.147
AND ALL IT IS.

03:23:46.213 --> 03:23:47.715
TRYING TO DO ALL THAT IT ASKS

03:23:47.782 --> 03:23:49.183
FOR.

03:23:49.250 --> 03:23:51.485
IT JUST AGGREGATE.

03:23:51.552 --> 03:23:52.753
HOME SCHOOLING FROM OTHER

03:23:52.820 --> 03:23:53.888

PARENT GUARDIAN OR OTHER

03:24:18.045 --> 03:24:20.681
INDIVIDUAL OPERATING A PRIVATE

SECTARIAN

03:24:26.454 --> 03:24:29.757
SCHOOL SO WOULD BROADEN.

03:24:29.824 --> 03:24:33.761
GIVE MORE DETAILED INFORMATION

03:24:35.229 --> 03:24:39.500
RECEIVING.

03:24:39.567 --> 03:24:40.267
MY QUESTION THOUGH IS.

03:24:40.334 --> 03:24:41.669
YOU KNOW USUALLY WHEN WE'RE

03:24:41.736 --> 03:24:42.370
COLLECTING.

03:24:42.436 --> 03:24:43.938
DATA OR INFORMATION WE DO SO

03:24:44.005 --> 03:24:44.672
FOR A REASON

03:24:44.739 --> 03:24:46.907
SO WHAT IS THE. REASON THAT WE

03:24:46.974 --> 03:24:49.477
NEED TO HAVE THIS DISAGGREGATED

03:24:49.543 --> 03:24:50.111
DATA WHAT ARE WE PLANNING TO DO

03:24:50.177 --> 03:24:51.712
WITH I I I THINK IT WOULD GIVE A

03:24:51.779 --> 03:24:53.814
BETTER PICTURE. OF OF THE

03:24:53.881 --> 03:24:55.683
EDUCATIONAL A LANDSCAPE IN THE

03:24:55.750 --> 03:24:56.851
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

03:24:56.917 --> 03:24:59.253
I I'D.

03:24:59.320 --> 03:24:59.954
I DISAGREE THAT.

03:25:00.021 --> 03:25:01.956
.

03:25:02.023 --> 03:25:03.691
THERE'S ANY SINISTER.

03:25:03.758 --> 03:25:06.060
PURPOSE FOR IT.

03:25:06.127 --> 03:25:06.694
A MATTER OF FACT

03:25:06.761 --> 03:25:09.630
A.

03:25:09.697 --> 03:25:11.799
EXCEPT REDUCE ABROGATING THAT

03:25:11.866 --> 03:25:13.534

03:25:13.601 --> 03:25:16.103
INFORMATION IS ALREADY SHARE. ON

03:25:16.170 --> 03:25:20.608
THE AFFIDAVIT.

03:25:20.675 --> 03:25:22.476
WELL.

03:25:22.543 --> 03:25:24.111
AYE I YOU KNOW I I VERY MUCH DO

03:25:24.178 --> 03:25:25.179
APPRECIATE THAT YOU'VE NARROWED

03:25:25.246 --> 03:25:26.747
YOUR BILL BUT I THINK THAT WHEN

03:25:26.814 --> 03:25:27.882
YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S CONCERNING

03:25:27.948 --> 03:25:29.817
FOLKS HERE IS THAT I THINK WE

03:25:29.884 --> 03:25:31.085
SAW A LITTLE BIT OF THE INTENSE

03:25:31.152 --> 03:25:31.886
WHEN WE HAVE A MUCH BROADER

03:25:31.952 --> 03:25:33.354
LEGISLATION.

03:25:33.421 --> 03:25:34.255
AND I THINK THAT ALL THE FOLKS

03:25:34.321 --> 03:25:35.723
WHO.

03:25:35.790 --> 03:25:36.691

TRAVELED A LONG WAYS TO BE HERE.

03:25:39.427 --> 03:25:41.429

TARGETED UNFAIRLY AND.

03:25:43.230 --> 03:25:44.565

DEEPLY TROUBLED.

03:25:49.670 --> 03:25:51.038
BY THE DIRECTION OF THIS

03:25:51.105 --> 03:25:51.639
LEGISLATION AND I THINK COULD

04:17:26.464 --> 04:17:28.166
THAT'S PART OF IT THERE'S OTHER

04:17:28.232 --> 04:17:29.200
FACILITIES LIKE IS THE BATHROOMS

04:17:29.267 --> 04:17:30.034
OF AND YET RIGHT FACILITY

04:17:30.101 --> 04:17:31.702
FIFTEEN YEARS AGO THAT'S RIGHT

04:17:31.769 --> 04:17:34.806
WELL. IN THE FACILITIES A AREA.

04:17:34.872 --> 04:17:37.441
EACH SCHOOL GOES THROUGH BY.

04:17:37.508 --> 04:17:39.877
FACILITIES INSPECTION REVIEW OR

04:17:39.944 --> 04:17:43.781
SOMETHING. RIGHT. AND SOMETIMES

04:17:43.848 --> 04:17:45.149
UP WELL THEY'RE REQUIRED TO

04:17:45.216 --> 04:17:47.084
REPORT WHETHER FACILITIES THAT

04:17:47.151 --> 04:17:50.555
HAVE BEEN INSPECTED ARE IN FAIR

04:17:50.621 --> 04:17:52.156
GOOD OR POOR CONDITION. WHAT

04:17:52.223 --> 04:17:54.358
WE'VE SEEN IS THAT DOESN'T MATCH

04:17:54.425 --> 04:17:55.526
UP TO WHAT THE REPORT IN THE

04:17:55.593 --> 04:17:57.128

WITH WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT BY

04:17:59.931 --> 04:18:00.464
THINK YOU OUGHT TO BE CAREFUL

04:18:00.531 --> 04:18:01.199
SOME OF THIS BECAUSE?

04:18:01.265 --> 04:18:02.567
I KNOW IN MY OWN CLASSROOM

04:18:02.633 --> 04:18:03.534
SETTING.

04:18:03.601 --> 04:18:05.503
EVERY CHILD HAD A TEXT BOOK TO

04:18:05.570 --> 04:18:07.738
TAKE HOME THAT WE DID BUT IT WAS

04:18:07.805 --> 04:18:08.806
A DIFFERENT TEXTBOOK THAT WE

04:18:08.873 --> 04:18:10.374
ASSIGN WORK OUT OF A HOME. SO WE

04:18:10.441 --> 04:18:11.676
DON'T EVEN HAVE THOSE TEXTBOOKS

04:18:11.742 --> 04:18:13.177
AVAILABLE CLASSROOM.

04:18:13.244 --> 04:18:15.179
SO I JUST.

04:18:15.246 --> 04:18:16.280
BE CAREFUL AYE NICE HOPE WE'RE

04:18:16.347 --> 04:18:18.182
WE'RE WE'RE CAREFUL ABOUT HOW

04:18:18.249 --> 04:18:18.783
THIS IMPACTS LOGISTICS ON THE

04:18:18.850 --> 04:18:20.351
GROUND.

04:18:20.418 --> 04:18:21.586
ON THE MIGHT OF TO TEXT FOR

04:18:21.652 --> 04:18:23.421
CLASS THEY MIGHT KNOW ONLY.

04:18:23.487 --> 04:18:24.755
NOT NOT HAVE ENOUGH IN THE

04:18:24.822 --> 04:18:25.623
SCHOOLS DISTRICT MIGHT NOT BY

04:18:25.690 --> 04:18:26.691
ENOUGH I HAVE TO HAVE AN IN

04:18:26.757 --> 04:18:28.259
CLASS AT THAT'S WHERE I REALLY.

04:18:28.326 --> 04:18:29.794
BECAME FRUSTRATED IN MY OWN

04:18:29.861 --> 04:18:32.363
EXPERIENCE THEY HAD A HOME. YOU

04:18:32.430 --> 04:18:33.364

YOU MIGHT. OKAY SO. IN OUR

04:18:38.736 --> 04:18:41.038
CONFERENCE I JUST HOPE WE'RE NOT

04:18:41.105 --> 04:18:41.706
GETTING TO PARTICULAR AND

04:18:41.772 --> 04:18:43.307
AND WALKING OUT OPPORTUNITIES

04:18:43.374 --> 04:18:44.976
FOR STUDENTS TO LEARN RATHER

04:18:45.042 --> 04:18:46.611
THAN UNLOCKING THE MEN.

04:18:46.677 --> 04:18:48.246
YOU KNOW A ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAIR

04:18:48.312 --> 04:18:50.214

04:18:51.816 --> 04:18:53.417
SETTLEMENT DISCUSSIONS.

04:18:53.484 --> 04:18:55.820
AND SO THE LEGISLATION SAYS A

04:18:55.887 --> 04:18:57.889
TEXTBOOK TO USE IN CLASS AND TO

04:18:57.955 --> 04:18:59.991
TAKE HOME BUT IT DOES NOT

04:19:00.057 --> 04:19:01.959
REQUIRE TWO SETS.

04:19:02.026 --> 04:19:04.495
ALL IT WAS A BUT IT WAS ABOUT

04:19:04.562 --> 04:19:06.764
ENSURE AND OR. IF IT GOT THAT OR

04:19:06.831 --> 04:19:08.065

04:19:11.736 --> 04:19:13.170
SCHOOLS.

04:19:13.237 --> 04:19:15.306
HAD MATERIALS TOO USED TO REFER

04:19:15.373 --> 04:19:18.109
TO FOR HOMEWORK BECAUSE WE FOUND

04:19:18.175 --> 04:19:19.644

TIED DOWN ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

04:35:26.343 --> 04:35:27.644
BUT I COME FROM THE REAL WORLD

04:35:27.711 --> 04:35:28.678
QUOTE UNQUOTE WHERE I SEE KIDS

04:35:28.745 --> 04:35:30.780

FROM SOMEONE WHO WORKS AT A

04:35:43.260 --> 04:35:45.562
SCHOOL WHY THIS IS A GOOD IDEA

04:35:45.629 --> 04:35:47.063
TO GET. I GET THAT I DON'T WANT

THEN THE PUNISHMENT'S ON THE

04:36:02.312 --> 04:36:03.380
PUNISH SITE PICKED UP IS THAT

04:36:03.446 --> 04:36:05.448
NOT WHAT ABOUT. I'M MORE

04:36:05.515 --> 04:36:06.883
CONCERNED ABOUT THE INTERVENTION

04:36:06.950 --> 04:36:08.351
YOU GOT TWO KIDS GOING AT IT.

04:36:08.418 --> 04:36:10.954
YOU KNOW YOU GOT.

IT'S GOING TO GROW IF YOU DON'T.

04:36:16.426 --> 04:36:17.761
IF YOU DON'T REACT.

04:36:17.827 --> 04:36:19.596
THAT MAYBE A BIGGER PROBLEM

04:36:19.663 --> 04:36:20.597
HERE YOU JUST CAN'T SIT THERE

04:36:20.664 --> 04:36:21.998
WATCH KIDS FIGHT AND IS THIS

04:36:22.065 --> 04:36:23.667
GOING TO HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT.

04:36:23.733 --> 04:36:25.302
ON OUR STEPS WILLINGNESS AND

04:36:25.368 --> 04:36:27.170
ABILITY TO INTERACT WITH KIDS

04:36:27.237 --> 04:36:28.204
INTO CONTROL SITUATIONS THAT

04:36:28.271 --> 04:36:30.941
MIGHT ALREADY. BE OUT OF HAND.

04:36:31.007 --> 04:36:32.275
I'M NOT SURE IF WE'RE ACTUALLY

04:36:32.342 --> 04:36:33.576
TALKING ABOUT FIGHTS AND AT THE

04:36:33.643 --> 04:36:35.178
PLAYGROUND AT LUNCH TIME THOSE

04:36:35.245 --> 04:36:36.713
THINGS MAY HAPPEN IN AND

04:36:36.780 --> 04:36:38.114
OFTENTIMES THERE OF SECURITY

04:36:38.181 --> 04:36:39.716
FOLKS THAT IT THERE. TO HANDLE

04:36:39.783 --> 04:36:41.551
THOSE PARTICULAR ISSUES AND TO

04:36:41.618 --> 04:36:43.053
AND TO AND TO ENGAGE IT WE'RE

04:36:43.119 --> 04:36:44.721
PROBABLY TALKING MORE IN TERMS

04:36:44.788 --> 04:36:45.655
OF STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS

04:36:45.722 --> 04:36:48.391
WEBER. OF WHO BASICALLY ARE A

04:36:48.458 --> 04:36:50.060
AND CLASSROOMS WHO NEED VARIOUS

04:36:50.126 --> 04:36:52.028
KINDS OF ACTIVITIES DONE TO KEEP

04:36:52.095 --> 04:36:52.796
THEM FROM.

04:36:52.862 --> 04:36:53.897
BASICALLY HURTING THEMSELVES OR

04:36:53.964 --> 04:36:55.799
HURTING SOMEONE ELSE AND SO IT'S

04:36:55.865 --> 04:36:57.600
A BUT AS POINTED OUT. BUT WE'RE

04:36:57.667 --> 04:36:59.102
NOT TAKING AWAY THE ABILITY TO

04:36:59.169 --> 04:37:00.270
DO RESTRAINTS IF THAT'S

04:37:00.337 --> 04:37:02.405
NECESSARY OUGHT TO BASICALLY

04:37:02.472 --> 04:37:03.840
ENGAGE AT THAT LEVEL BUT WE'RE

04:37:03.907 --> 04:37:05.408
SAYING THAT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT

04:37:05.475 --> 04:37:08.645
AS A. EDUCATOR IN A CLASSROOM

04:37:08.712 --> 04:37:09.646
AND ANNA SCHOOL SIDE IF YOU'RE

04:37:09.713 --> 04:37:10.981
OUT IN THE SCHOOL SITE THAT YOU

04:37:11.047 --> 04:37:12.048
KNOW THAT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS

04:37:12.115 --> 04:37:14.084
THAT YOU CAN USE TO NOT HAVE TO

04:37:14.150 --> 04:37:15.652
RESTRAIN CHILDREN. TO TIE THEM

04:37:15.719 --> 04:37:17.554
DOWN INTO TO THOSE KINDS OF

04:37:17.620 --> 04:37:19.389
THINGS AND I THINK OUR EXPERT

04:37:19.456 --> 04:37:20.590
WITNESS HERE WHO HAS A SCHOOL

04:37:20.657 --> 04:37:22.359
WHO'S DEALT WITH THOSE. CHILDREN

04:37:22.425 --> 04:37:23.226
AND IF YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO

04:37:23.293 --> 04:37:25.428
THE QUESTION OF HAS DEMONSTRATED

04:37:25.495 --> 04:37:26.463
THAT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS THAT

04:37:26.529 --> 04:37:28.031
WE NEED TO DO IT. YOU KNOW ONE

04:37:28.098 --> 04:37:28.965
OF THE SAD THINGS OFTEN TO

04:37:29.032 --> 04:37:30.600
HAPPENINGS IS AS WE SAY DO WE

04:37:30.667 --> 04:37:32.836
REALLY NEED TO DO THIS WHAT WE

04:37:32.902 --> 04:37:33.603
REALLY DO BECAUSE.

04:37:33.670 --> 04:37:35.438
IF OFTENTIMES WE HAVE BECOME LAX

04:37:35.505 --> 04:37:36.873
IN IT WHEN WE MOVED AWAY FROM

04:37:36.940 --> 04:37:38.475
THE ONE WE DID HAVE RESOURCES

04:37:38.541 --> 04:37:39.309
HOPEFULLY TO PROBABLY TO TRAIN

04:37:39.376 --> 04:37:41.011
PEOPLE. AND AS A RESULT WHEN YOU

04:37:41.077 --> 04:37:42.379
DON'T SAY THINGS AND YOU HAVE

04:37:42.445 --> 04:37:44.014
NEW POPULATION THE PEOPLE COMING

04:37:44.080 --> 04:37:45.482
INTO THE SCHOOLS TO WORK.

04:37:45.548 --> 04:37:46.649
YOU HAVEN'T GIVEN THEM THE

04:37:46.716 --> 04:37:47.984
INFORMATION AND THE AND THE

04:37:48.051 --> 04:37:49.119
GUIDELINES IN THE THINGS THAT

04:37:49.185 --> 04:37:50.820
THEY NEED. SO THEREFORE THINGS

04:37:50.887 --> 04:37:51.421
GO AWRY.

04:37:51.488 --> 04:37:52.889
THEN WE'RE CONFRONTED WITH THE

04:37:52.956 --> 04:37:53.790
SITUATION SOMETHING HORRIBLE

04:37:53.857 --> 04:37:55.392
HAPPENS.

04:37:55.458 --> 04:37:56.926
THEN PEOPLE COME UP TO US AND

04:37:56.993 --> 04:37:59.129
ASK US WHY IS IT SOME CHILD DIED

04:37:59.195 --> 04:38:01.431
ON A CAMPUS WIDE TO SOME KID WAS

04:38:01.498 --> 04:38:03.099
HOSPITALIZED Y. THE SOME. HERE

04:38:03.166 --> 04:38:04.167
HAVE THEIR BACK BROKEN OR

04:38:04.234 --> 04:38:06.302
SOMETHING FROM PEOPLE SITTING ON

04:38:06.369 --> 04:38:07.203
THEM AND TRYING TO HOLD THEM ON

04:38:07.270 --> 04:38:09.039
THE GROUND I MEAN WIPE Y.

04:38:09.105 --> 04:38:10.573
BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED A

04:38:10.640 --> 04:38:13.410
POSITIVE. APPROACH TO IT AFFRONT

04:38:13.476 --> 04:38:14.711
PREVENTING RATHER THAN WAITING

04:38:14.778 --> 04:38:16.112
TO AFTER THE FACT OF TRY TO CURE

04:38:16.179 --> 04:38:16.946
SOMETHING.

04:38:17.013 --> 04:38:17.514
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS

04:38:17.580 --> 04:38:19.883
ABOUT.

04:38:19.949 --> 04:38:21.117
AND HELL IF YOU WILL BE VERY

04:38:21.184 --> 04:38:21.951
WHEN HIS COMMENTS BECAUSE YOU IN

04:38:22.018 --> 04:38:22.919
A SAVINGS DON'T DON'T YOU HAVE A

04:38:22.986 --> 04:38:24.054
PARTICULAR.

04:38:24.120 --> 04:38:25.522
DO CHIU SYRUP PARTICULAR.

04:38:25.588 --> 04:38:26.956
A PARTICULAR PART OUR STUDENT

04:38:27.023 --> 04:38:27.791
POPULATION AT YOUR SCHOOL SITE

04:38:27.857 --> 04:38:29.426
OR YOU HAVE.

04:38:29.492 --> 04:38:30.960
ALL TYPES OF STUDENTS IN YOUR

04:38:31.027 --> 04:38:33.396
SCHOOL. WE SERVE ARM ALL THE WAY

04:38:33.463 --> 04:38:35.799
FROM SEVERELY DISABLED TO MODERN

04:38:35.865 --> 04:38:38.668
DESIGN SO SIMILAR QUESTION REACH

04:38:38.735 --> 04:38:39.302
ON I'M GONNA I'M GONNA GET THAT

04:38:39.369 --> 04:38:41.204
YOU TALK WITH. THAT'S MY CONCERN

04:38:41.271 --> 04:38:42.439
IS I I THINK.

04:38:42.505 --> 04:38:43.073
IT SEEMS THAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING

04:38:43.139 --> 04:38:43.873
ABOUT IS STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL

04:38:43.940 --> 04:38:46.776
NEEDS STUDENT IP SIX ADDRESS.

04:38:46.843 --> 04:38:47.844
AND I GET I GET THAT.

04:38:47.911 --> 04:38:49.979
BUT I'M ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT

04:38:50.046 --> 04:38:51.815
STUDENTS WITHOUT IP STUDENTS

04:38:51.881 --> 04:38:53.049
THAT ARE NOT SPECIAL NEEDS IT

04:38:53.116 --> 04:38:54.984
SEEMS PRETTY BROAD. AND I DON'T

04:38:55.051 --> 04:38:56.653
WANT AGAIN ANY STUDENT TO BE

04:38:56.719 --> 04:38:57.987
RESTRAINED.

04:38:58.054 --> 04:39:00.690
ESPECIALLY FOR PUNISHMENT. OF

04:39:00.757 --> 04:39:02.158
MY CONCERNS WERE TALKING WE SEEM

04:39:02.225 --> 04:39:04.594
TO BE FOCUSING ON. A YOU KNOW

04:39:04.661 --> 04:39:05.628
STE JUST SOME OF OUR STUDENT

04:39:05.695 --> 04:39:07.530
POPULATION AND YET IF THE BILL

04:39:07.597 --> 04:39:08.565
APPLIES TO ALL OF OUR STUDENT

04:39:08.631 --> 04:39:10.066
POPULATION.

04:39:10.133 --> 04:39:11.301
IF I COULD JUST JUMP IN THIS

04:39:11.367 --> 04:39:12.902
BILL REALLY DOES NOT ALLOW A

04:39:12.969 --> 04:39:14.304
DOES NOT PROHIBIT A TEACHERS

04:39:14.370 --> 04:39:15.505
FROM JUMPING IN TO BREAK UP THE

04:39:15.572 --> 04:39:16.706
KIND OF A FIGHT THAT YOU WOULD.

04:39:16.773 --> 04:39:18.208
YOU'RE DESCRIBING IT DOESN'T

04:39:18.274 --> 04:39:20.376
STOP A TEACHER FROM GRABBING A

04:39:20.443 --> 04:39:21.344
FIVE YEAR OLD IS RUNNING INTO

04:39:21.411 --> 04:39:23.546
TRAFFIC WHAT IT DOES STOP IS

04:39:23.613 --> 04:39:25.148
USING PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS

04:39:25.215 --> 04:39:26.649
TECHNIQUES THAT WE KNOW ENSURING

04:39:26.716 --> 04:39:28.151
KILL THAT ARE PROHIBITED

04:39:28.218 --> 04:39:29.519
EVERYPLACE ALL TO RESTRAIN

04:39:29.586 --> 04:39:30.720
SECLUSION ARE USED.

04:39:30.787 --> 04:39:31.554
SO.

04:39:31.621 --> 04:39:34.090
IT DOESN'T PROHIBIT THE KIND OF.

04:39:34.157 --> 04:39:36.359
JUST IT YOU KNOW INCIDENTS THAT

04:39:36.426 --> 04:39:37.127
YOU'RE DESCRIBING.

04:39:37.193 --> 04:39:38.761
.

04:39:38.828 --> 04:39:40.196
PART OF THE REASON WHY WE HAVE

04:39:40.263 --> 04:39:41.364
AN AND DISABILITY RIGHTS

04:39:41.431 --> 04:39:43.099
CALIFORNIA HAS DONE DOZENS AND

04:39:43.166 --> 04:39:44.334
DOZENS OF CASES WHERE KIDS TO

04:39:44.400 --> 04:39:46.202
RESTRAIN SECLUDED NOT BECAUSE

04:39:46.269 --> 04:39:47.804
THEY POSE AN IMAGE IMMINENT RISK

04:39:47.871 --> 04:39:48.905
BECAUSE. THEY WOULDN'T STAY

04:39:48.972 --> 04:39:50.607
SEATED IN THEIR CHAIR FOR AN

04:39:50.673 --> 04:39:51.541
HOUR DURING.

04:39:51.608 --> 04:39:54.043
A CLASSROOM EXERCISE ON THAT

04:39:54.110 --> 04:39:55.478
THAT THAT'S WHAT I GET I GET I

04:39:55.545 --> 04:39:56.746
GET THAT COMPONENT I'M JUST

04:39:56.813 --> 04:39:57.380
WORRIED BOUT THE MUCH BROADER

04:39:57.447 --> 04:39:59.916
PICTURE APPROACHED THIS BILL HAS

04:39:59.983 --> 04:40:01.818
TODAY. SO THIS BILL AGAIN DOES

04:40:01.885 --> 04:40:03.920
NOT PREVENT TEACHERS FROM

04:40:03.987 --> 04:40:06.723
INTERVENING ON IT JUST PROHIBITS

04:40:06.789 --> 04:40:08.324
PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS PRACTICES

04:40:08.391 --> 04:40:10.660
AND IT REQUIRES THAT THE CHILD'S

04:40:10.727 --> 04:40:12.862
BEHAVIOR POSE A RISK BEFORE. A

04:40:12.929 --> 04:40:15.131
TEACHER INTERVENE.

04:40:15.198 --> 04:40:16.599
AND THE REASON WHY IT'S NOT JUST

04:40:16.666 --> 04:40:18.101
A SPECIAL EDUCATION BILL AS WE

04:40:18.168 --> 04:40:19.636
THINK THAT THESE PROTECTIONS

04:40:19.702 --> 04:40:21.437
SHOULD APPLY TO ALL STUDENTS. ON

04:40:21.504 --> 04:40:23.206
DATA COLLECTED BY THE US

04:40:23.273 --> 04:40:24.374
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SHOWS

04:40:24.440 --> 04:40:26.509
THAT GENERAL ED STUDENTS ARE

04:40:26.576 --> 04:40:29.045
EXPOSED TO THESE PRACTICES JUST

04:40:29.112 --> 04:40:30.380
AS MUCH AS SPECIAL ED STUDENTS

04:40:30.446 --> 04:40:31.714
ARE LEAST EXPOSED.

04:40:31.781 --> 04:40:32.782
WE CERTAINLY KNOW SOME OF THE

04:40:32.849 --> 04:40:34.050
DATA SHOWS THAT SPECIAL ED

04:40:34.117 --> 04:40:36.219
STUDENTS ARE EXPOSED MUCH MORE.

04:40:36.286 --> 04:40:37.520
THANK YOU THANK YOU ART DOT

04:40:37.587 --> 04:40:38.688
CONTINUED SAYS I JUST TODAY I'M

04:40:38.755 --> 04:40:40.423
NOT CONVINCED.

04:40:40.490 --> 04:40:41.491
THAT I'M WORRIED THAT THIS IS

04:40:41.558 --> 04:40:43.126
TOO BROAD.

04:40:43.193 --> 04:40:45.094
AND I UNDERSTAND WHEN IS AN IEP

04:40:45.161 --> 04:40:46.529
AND YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT ONLY

04:40:46.596 --> 04:40:48.097
STUDENTS OF A YOU KNOW. OF UP

04:40:48.164 --> 04:40:49.365
ONLY A SPECIFIC PART ARE STERN

04:40:49.432 --> 04:40:51.134
POPULATION OR SCHOOL I THINK.

04:40:51.201 --> 04:40:53.136
THIS IS A BETTER FIT. I WONDER

04:40:53.203 --> 04:40:55.805
IF IT'S THE BEST FIT.

04:40:55.872 --> 04:40:57.240
FOR FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENT

04:40:57.307 --> 04:40:59.142
POPULATION AND AGAIN.

04:40:59.209 --> 04:41:00.610
LET ME CLARIFY I DON'T WANT

04:41:00.677 --> 04:41:02.245
ANYONE RESTRAINT BUT AT THE SAME

04:41:02.312 --> 04:41:03.980
TIME. AND WHEN YOU HAVE STUDENTS

HAPPEN YOU KNOW BUT OFTENTIMES A

04:41:18.094 --> 04:41:19.596
RESTRAINT TO USE NOT BECAUSE A

BECAUSE A KID KEPT TOPONYMIC

04:41:45.722 --> 04:41:46.656
COULDN'T STOP HIM FROM TALKING.

04:41:46.723 --> 04:41:47.724
YOU KNOW THEY HAD TO GET THE

04:41:47.790 --> 04:41:48.758
LAST WORD IN AND THEY WERE

04:41:48.825 --> 04:41:50.093
RUNNING THEIR MOUTH AND THE

04:41:50.159 --> 04:41:52.395
TEACHER GOT UPSET TO INCLUDE KID

BUT ANYBODY ELSE AND THEY JUST

04:42:00.136 --> 04:42:01.137
RUN INTO MY HOUSE AND SOMETIMES

04:42:01.204 --> 04:42:02.071
THIS IS THE ONLY WAY THEY KNOW

04:42:02.138 --> 04:42:03.406
HOW TO STOP OF ONE RESTRAIN

04:42:03.473 --> 04:42:05.174
WHATEVER IT WAS. SO IT'S NOT

04:42:05.241 --> 04:42:07.810
ALWAYS THE FACT THAT THE PERSON

04:42:07.877 --> 04:42:09.078
IS THAT IS IS.

04:42:09.145 --> 04:42:10.113
ALL IS IS HURTING THEMSELVES OF

04:42:10.179 --> 04:42:11.014
SOMEONE ELSE'S THAT THIS IS A

04:42:11.080 --> 04:42:12.515
STRATEGY THAT SHOULD NOT BE USED

04:42:12.582 --> 04:42:13.850
UNLESS THERE IS A SITUATION OF

04:42:13.916 --> 04:42:15.318
DANGER. AND YOU'RE TO PREVENT

04:42:15.385 --> 04:42:17.053
SOMETHING FROM HER HAPPENING

04:42:17.120 --> 04:42:17.587
THAT'S THEIR.

04:42:17.654 --> 04:42:19.956
YOU KNOW WE AS A SOCIETY HAVE

04:42:20.023 --> 04:42:20.590
TO BEGIN TO.

04:42:20.657 --> 04:42:22.792
ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT IT'S

04:42:22.859 --> 04:42:23.426
OFTENTIMES THERE'S

04:42:23.493 --> 04:42:24.894
DISPROPORTIONATE TREATMENT AND

04:42:24.961 --> 04:42:26.863
WE RECOGNIZE THAT IN THE FEDERAL

04:42:26.929 --> 04:42:27.997
GUIDELINES THAT HAVE COME OUT OF

04:42:28.064 --> 04:42:29.399
FEDERAL REPORTS HAVE SHOWN THAT

04:42:29.465 --> 04:42:30.566
AFRICAN AMERICAN MALES ARE MORE

04:42:30.633 --> 04:42:32.268
LIKELY TO BE THROWN ON THE

04:42:32.335 --> 04:42:33.069
GROUND AND TO BE. THE ONLY GETS

04:42:33.136 --> 04:42:35.038
WALL SO IT SHOULDN'T SURPRISE US

04:42:35.104 --> 04:42:36.139
WHEN WE SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

04:42:36.205 --> 04:42:37.273
THEY BECOME ADULTS.

04:42:37.340 --> 04:42:38.708
THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE

04:42:38.775 --> 04:42:40.243
THOSE LEVELS OF RESTRAINTS AND

04:42:40.310 --> 04:42:41.778
AND ACTIVITIES THAT IT THERE AND

04:42:41.844 --> 04:42:43.479
OFFICE ALSO THERE MORE OFTEN

04:42:43.546 --> 04:42:44.714
LIKELY TO BE CLASSIFIED A

04:42:44.781 --> 04:42:45.615
SPECIAL LIVE WHY BECAUSE

04:42:45.682 --> 04:42:47.216
BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS. NOT

04:42:47.283 --> 04:42:48.418
NECESSARILY BECAUSE OF ACADEMIC

04:42:48.484 --> 04:42:49.852
PROBLEMS BUT BECAUSE OF BEHAVIOR

04:42:49.919 --> 04:42:51.654
PROBLEMS SO IF WE'RE GOING TO

04:42:51.721 --> 04:42:52.722
ADDRESS THAT BEGIN TO ADDRESS

04:42:52.789 --> 04:42:54.424
THIS EARLY IN LIFE WE HAVE TO

04:42:54.490 --> 04:42:55.858
START IN THE SCHOOLS AND MAKE

04:42:55.925 --> 04:42:57.427

04:43:04.367 --> 04:43:05.635
IN THE STATE AND YOU LOOK AT

SIGNIFICANTLY BUT KIDS WOULD

04:43:29.892 --> 04:43:31.394
SPECIALLY BUT ALSO SOMETIMES FOR

04:43:31.461 --> 04:43:33.496

CHANGE PRACTICE IN A POSITIVE

04:44:17.774 --> 04:44:19.275
WAY SO THIS POLICY

04:44:19.342 --> 04:44:20.643
RECOMMENDATIONS CAME THAT FROM

04:44:20.710 --> 04:44:22.178
THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION

04:44:22.245 --> 04:44:23.880
THEY ISSUED A GUIDANCE A FIFTEEN

04:44:23.946 --> 04:44:24.847
RECOMMENDED.

04:44:24.914 --> 04:44:27.216
GUIDELINES THAT STATES SHOULD

04:44:27.283 --> 04:44:28.551
IMPLEMENT AND SO WE.

04:44:28.618 --> 04:44:30.653
THEN LOOKED AT THE U. S.

04:44:30.720 --> 04:44:32.255
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION'S

04:44:32.321 --> 04:44:34.590
ANALYSIS OF HOW EVERY STATE IS

04:44:36.292 --> 04:44:37.226
CHART FORM SAID THESE ARE THE

04:44:37.293 --> 04:44:38.327
RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE US

04:44:38.394 --> 04:44:39.729
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ABOUT

04:44:39.796 --> 04:44:41.330
WHAT SCHOOLS. A STATE SHOULD

04:44:41.397 --> 04:44:44.000
ADOPT.

04:44:56.779 --> 04:44:58.781
CONSTERNATION AND AND PEOPLE

04:44:58.848 --> 04:45:00.149
WHO'VE RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT

04:45:00.216 --> 04:45:01.984
BALANCE I WOULD JUST SAY THAT.

04:45:02.051 --> 04:45:04.220
I THINK THAT THIS BILL IS MOVING

04:45:04.287 --> 04:45:05.955
IN THE DIRECTION OF WHERE REALLY

04:45:06.022 --> 04:45:07.857
THE SECTORS HAVE BEEN GOING TO

04:45:07.924 --> 04:45:08.624
SAY THAT.

04:45:08.691 --> 04:45:10.126
WE SHOULD BE USING RESTRAINT ON

04:45:10.193 --> 04:45:11.761
THEIR KIDS.

04:45:11.828 --> 04:45:13.229
EVEN FOR KIDS WHO HAVE SEVERE

04:45:13.296 --> 04:45:14.397
NEEDS THAT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS

04:45:14.464 --> 04:45:16.299
TO REDIRECT BEHAVIOR.

04:45:16.365 --> 04:45:19.268
AND AND THAT UNFORTUNATELY WHEN

04:45:19.335 --> 04:45:20.603
OUT RESTRAINT HAS BEEN RELIED

04:45:20.670 --> 04:45:22.772

SERIOUS HERE INJURY. AND TRAUMA.

FOR ME AND SO WHILE WE ALWAYS

04:45:29.512 --> 04:45:30.780
STRUGGLE HOW TO INTERVENE IN AN

04:45:30.847 --> 04:45:32.815
EMERGENCY SITUATION I THINK WE

04:45:32.882 --> 04:45:34.217
HAVE TO SAY. THAT.

04:45:34.283 --> 04:45:35.818
WE WANT TO LIMIT THE

04:45:35.885 --> 04:45:37.954
CIRCUMSTANCES WERE ASKING

04:45:38.020 --> 04:45:38.554
SOMEONE TO PUT THEIR HANDS ON

04:45:38.621 --> 04:45:39.388
SOME.

04:45:39.455 --> 04:45:41.657
AS A WAY OF REDIRECTING.

04:45:41.724 --> 04:45:43.993
BEHAVIOR THAT IS EITHER TYPICAL

04:45:44.060 --> 04:45:45.094
BEHAVIOR FOR THAT STUDENT

04:45:45.161 --> 04:45:46.562
REGARDLESS OF WHAT THAT STUDENTS

04:45:46.629 --> 04:45:47.396
LEVEL OF.

04:45:47.463 --> 04:45:50.833
PRACTICE BEHAVIOR FUNCTION IS

04:45:50.900 --> 04:45:51.634
BUT WE WE WHEN WE PUT OUR HANDS

04:45:51.701 --> 04:45:53.135

04:46:07.717 --> 04:46:09.051
ARE GUIDELINES THAT HAVE COME

04:46:09.118 --> 04:46:10.119
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS

04:46:10.186 --> 04:46:11.254
TO HOW WE SHOULD BE ACTING IN

04:46:11.320 --> 04:46:12.655
OUR SCHOOLS AND WHAT STATES HAVE

04:46:12.722 --> 04:46:15.024
ADOPTED. AND WHERE WE STAND YOU

04:46:15.091 --> 04:46:16.893

SUFFERING FROM TRAUMA AND THAT'S

04:46:28.905 --> 04:46:30.640
SO TRUE THE LAST THING WE WANT

04:46:30.706 --> 04:46:32.208
TO DO IS TO CREATE MORE TRAUMA

04:46:32.275 --> 04:46:34.110

04:54:29.818 --> 04:54:30.986
DEPARTMENT EDUCATION WOULD BE

04:54:31.053 --> 04:54:32.321
ABLE TO SHARE THE DATA THEY

04:54:32.388 --> 04:54:33.956

04:54:40.229 --> 04:54:41.797
SINCE THIS PROCESS WOULD BE

04:54:41.864 --> 04:54:43.232
AUTOMATED THIS WOULD ALLOW FOR

04:54:43.298 --> 04:54:44.833
YEARLY TEACHER MONITORING

04:54:44.900 --> 04:54:46.535
INSTEAD OF EVERY FOUR YEARS.

04:54:46.602 --> 04:54:47.603
THIS WOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

04:54:47.669 --> 04:54:49.238
OUR EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES TO RUN

04:54:49.304 --> 04:54:51.240

HOWEVER THIS IS A BIG CHANGE

04:54:55.644 --> 04:54:56.912
FROM THE CURRENT PROCESS AND

04:54:56.979 --> 04:54:58.480
REQUIRES INPUT FROM MULTIPLE

REGULATIONS.

04:58:52.648 --> 04:58:54.216

CONSEQUENCE

04:58:56.285 --> 04:58:57.653

REQUIREMENT IS ALREADY IN PLACE

05:00:49.431 --> 05:00:50.232
THIS IS JUST STREAMLINING THE

05:00:50.298 --> 05:00:50.866
REQUIREMENTS OF WHATEVER THEY

05:00:50.932 --> 05:00:52.167
WERE DOING. BEFORE AND WHAT WAS

05:00:52.234 --> 05:00:53.235
ACCEPT ACCEPTABLE FOR

FLEXIBILITY IN CREDENTIALING IS

STILL GOING TO BE DONE THIS IS

05:00:55.804 --> 05:00:58.807
JUST REALLY AUTOMATING.

05:00:58.874 --> 05:01:00.542
THAT PROCESS SO WOULD IT THEN

05:01:00.609 --> 05:01:01.510
HOW DOES THIS APPLY TO CHARTER

05:01:01.576 --> 05:01:03.044
SAYS WELL THAT'S THAT THE

05:01:03.111 --> 05:01:03.612
CHARTERS.

05:01:03.678 --> 05:01:06.148
WE INITIALLY HAD NOT A.

05:01:06.214 --> 05:01:07.983
APPLIED THIS BILL TO CHARTERS

05:01:08.049 --> 05:01:08.517
DISK THERE WAS A COMMITTEE

05:01:08.583 --> 05:01:10.085
AMENDMENT THAT INCLUDED THE

05:01:10.152 --> 05:01:11.820
CHARTER SO WE HAVE NOT WORKED

05:01:11.887 --> 05:01:12.020
WITH.

05:01:12.087 --> 05:01:14.356
ON THE FLEXIBILITY GET ON THE

05:01:14.423 --> 05:01:16.091
ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY THAT

SAY. YOU KNOW WE REALLY HAVE TO

05:01:23.532 --> 05:01:24.299
UNDERSTAND.

05:01:24.366 --> 05:01:26.568
EXACTLY WHAT IS. WHAT THEY DO

05:01:26.635 --> 05:01:28.303
WITH CREDENTIALING BEFORE WE CAN

05:01:28.370 --> 05:01:30.605
FIGURE OUT EXACTLY HOW TO

05:01:30.672 --> 05:01:31.173
INCLUDE THEM IN THIS YEAR I

05:01:31.239 --> 05:01:32.374
THINK? IT IF I COULD JUST ADD TO

05:01:32.441 --> 05:01:32.641
THAT SO.

05:01:32.707 --> 05:01:33.842
CURRENT AD CODE.

REGARDING CHARTER SCHOOLS.

05:01:34.843 --> 05:01:35.777
SAYS THAT A.

05:01:35.844 --> 05:01:36.611
TEACHER TO CHARTER SCHOOL

05:01:36.678 --> 05:01:37.813

CERTIFICATE PERMIT OR OTHER

05:01:38.914 --> 05:01:40.182
DOCUMENT THAT'S EQUIVALENT TO

05:01:40.248 --> 05:01:41.750
THAT WHICH A PUBLIC SCHOOL

05:01:41.817 --> 05:01:43.485
TEACHER WOULD HAVE. IF THEY ARE

05:01:43.552 --> 05:01:44.653

ARBIL ACTUALLY DOES NOT.

05:01:50.826 --> 05:01:52.093
AT ANY DEFINITION OF OF WHAT

05:01:52.160 --> 05:01:53.595
CORE SUBJECTS ARE BUT THERE ARE

05:01:53.662 --> 05:01:54.963
DEFINITIONS OF THAT ALREADY

05:01:55.030 --> 05:01:56.064
EXISTING IN STATE LAW.

05:01:56.131 --> 05:01:58.867
AWAY IF THEY'RE NOT IN A CORE.

05:01:58.934 --> 05:02:00.335
SUBJECT OR IF THEY'RE NOT IN A

05:02:00.402 --> 05:02:01.837
COLLEGE PREP COURSE THAN THEY DO

05:02:01.903 --> 05:02:03.605
YOU HAVE. A PRETTY WIDE

05:02:03.672 --> 05:02:05.707
DISCRETION ARE BILL DOESN'T

05:02:05.774 --> 05:02:06.508
CHANGE THAT THAT'S ALL EXISTING

05:02:06.575 --> 05:02:08.343
LAW. ALL THIS.

05:02:08.410 --> 05:02:10.412
THE ASSIGNMENT MONEY MONITORING

05:02:10.479 --> 05:02:11.413
PROCESS DOES

05:02:11.480 --> 05:02:12.280
IS.

05:02:12.347 --> 05:02:14.616
IT IT GIVES US A A MORE

05:02:14.683 --> 05:02:17.018
STREAMLINED WAY OF CHECKING UP

05:02:17.085 --> 05:02:19.221
ON WHETHER OR NOT SCHOOLS BOTH

05:02:19.287 --> 05:02:21.890
TRADITIONAL AND CHARTER. ARE.

05:02:21.957 --> 05:02:23.725
MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS THAT

05:02:23.792 --> 05:02:24.259
ALREADY CURRENTLY EXIST IN

05:02:24.326 --> 05:02:26.294
STATE.

05:02:26.361 --> 05:02:28.029
AND ADD TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT

05:02:28.096 --> 05:02:29.030
YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN PEOPLE ARE

05:02:29.097 --> 05:02:30.232
COMING UP WITH BLENDED COURSES

05:02:30.298 --> 05:02:30.765
OR TRY NEW AND INNOVATIVE

05:02:30.832 --> 05:02:31.733
THINGS.

05:02:31.800 --> 05:02:33.101
.

05:02:33.168 --> 05:02:36.004
THE COMMISSION AS WELL AS A

05:02:36.071 --> 05:02:37.706
COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION.

05:02:37.772 --> 05:02:40.442
PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO

05:02:40.509 --> 05:02:41.276
SCHOOLS.

05:02:41.343 --> 05:02:43.745
IN IN POSITIONS LIKE THAT.

05:02:43.812 --> 05:02:45.580
AND WE WE TRY TO HELP ADVISE

05:02:45.647 --> 05:02:47.382
THEM TO REMAIN WITHIN THE

05:02:47.449 --> 05:02:48.483
CONSTRAINTS OF EXISTING

05:02:48.550 --> 05:02:50.752
EDUCATION CODE. WHILE ALSO.

05:02:50.819 --> 05:02:52.454
ALLOWING THEM TO BE INNOVATIVE

05:02:52.521 --> 05:02:53.822
AND AND COME UP WITH NEW WAYS TO

05:02:53.889 --> 05:02:54.256
DELIVER.

05:02:54.322 --> 05:02:56.658
TRADING STOOD.

05:02:56.725 --> 05:02:59.694
SO MY ASSUMPTION IS THAT. AS A

05:02:59.761 --> 05:03:00.795
AS SINCE THIS IS SOMETHING ADDED

05:03:00.862 --> 05:03:01.329
ON IT BEGIN THAT.

05:03:01.396 --> 05:03:03.265
.

05:03:03.331 --> 05:03:04.733
THAT THERE ARE GOING TO BE SOME

05:03:04.799 --> 05:03:05.734
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT.

05:03:05.800 --> 05:03:07.602
WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IF YOU IF

05:03:07.669 --> 05:03:08.570
THEY HAVE TO BE CLIP INCLUDED IN

05:03:08.637 --> 05:03:10.205
THIS LIST?

05:03:10.272 --> 05:03:11.706
I ASSUME THAT THIS THIS THAT

05:03:11.773 --> 05:03:12.774
MUCH WORK STILL LEFT TO BE DONE

05:03:12.841 --> 05:03:15.176
AND NOT JUST.

05:03:15.243 --> 05:03:17.078
OFTENTIMES WE PUT IT ON SOMEBODY

05:03:17.145 --> 05:03:18.647
WITHOUT REALLY DOING THE WORK

05:03:18.713 --> 05:03:20.248
THE INTERNAL WORK AS YOU SAY YOU

05:03:20.315 --> 05:03:21.316
HADN'T GIVEN IT ANY THOUGHT

05:03:21.383 --> 05:03:23.184
UNTIL SOMEONE RECOMMENDED IT.

05:03:23.251 --> 05:03:25.787
ALL SO I ASSUME THAT THERE WILL

05:03:25.854 --> 05:03:26.621
BE SOME EFFORT TO.

05:03:26.688 --> 05:03:28.423
.

05:03:28.490 --> 05:03:30.258
DISCUSS HOW THEY'RE TO BE

05:03:30.325 --> 05:03:32.527
INCORPORATED IN THIS WELL DIRT

05:03:32.594 --> 05:03:33.628
DOES LIKE I MENTIONED BEFORE

05:03:33.695 --> 05:03:34.696
THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE

05:03:34.763 --> 05:03:36.097
STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS AND THE

05:03:36.164 --> 05:03:38.033
CHARTERS WERE NOT STAKEHOLDERS

05:03:38.099 --> 05:03:39.768
UNTIL VERY RECENTLY SO WE HAVE

05:03:39.834 --> 05:03:41.937
EVERY INTENTION TO.

05:03:42.003 --> 05:03:43.505
TO WORK WITH THEM AND AND AND.

05:03:43.572 --> 05:03:46.708
.

05:03:46.775 --> 05:03:47.309
YOU KNOW FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET

05:03:47.375 --> 05:03:50.278
INTO THE BILL.

05:03:50.345 --> 05:03:54.082
OKAY. ARE AYE I DON'T. HAVE TO

05:03:54.149 --> 05:03:54.716
DECIDE IF I'M GOING TO VOTE ON

05:03:54.783 --> 05:03:55.884
IT UNTIL IT'S DONE OKAY THANK

05:03:55.951 --> 05:03:57.352
YOU.

05:03:57.419 --> 05:03:57.919
I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THE

05:03:57.986 --> 05:03:58.787
PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO MAKE

05:03:58.853 --> 05:03:59.821
SURE THE TEACHERS ARE SIGN

05:03:59.888 --> 05:04:02.123
CORRECTLY IS THAT TRUE. CRACKED

05:04:02.190 --> 05:04:04.125
OKAY AND THIS REALLY JUST MERELY

05:04:04.192 --> 05:04:05.794
SET UP AN AUTOMATED PROCESS.

05:04:05.860 --> 05:04:06.995
FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS

05:04:07.062 --> 05:04:08.063
CALIFORNIA MUCH EASIER FASHION

05:04:08.129 --> 05:04:09.664
AND CHARTERS

05:04:09.731 --> 05:04:10.432
TO IDENTIFY WHETHER THEIR

05:04:10.498 --> 05:04:12.167
TEACHERS ARE SON CORRECTLY.

05:04:12.233 --> 05:04:14.035
SO I DON'T KNOW FROM THE CHARTER

05:04:14.102 --> 05:04:15.470
SIGN WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT AYE

05:04:15.537 --> 05:04:17.839
I FAIL TO SEE WHAT'S WRONG WITH

05:04:17.906 --> 05:04:19.474
THAT. OTHER THEN YO'VE GOT SOME

05:04:19.541 --> 05:04:20.141
YOU DON'T TELL US I MEAN IT'S

05:04:20.208 --> 05:04:21.142
PRETTY I MEAN YOU DO HAVE MORE

05:04:21.209 --> 05:04:22.877
LEEWAY.

05:04:22.944 --> 05:04:23.511
AND THE TRADITIONAL IS ALREADY

05:04:23.578 --> 05:04:25.413
WE'RE NOT ATTEMPTING TO CHANGE

05:04:25.480 --> 05:04:27.048
THAT TODAY SO I'M I'M I'M STILL

05:04:27.115 --> 05:04:29.184
CONFUSED AND WHERE THIS ARGUMENT

05:04:29.250 --> 05:04:30.719
COMES THAT THEY DON'T WANT IT TO

05:04:30.785 --> 05:04:32.253
ARTISTS AND AUTOMATED PROCESS.

05:04:32.320 --> 05:04:33.722
KIND HELPS EVERYBODY IDENTIFY

05:04:33.788 --> 05:04:34.923
WHETHER OR NOT TEACHERS ARE SITE

05:04:34.990 --> 05:04:37.225
CORRECTLY.

05:04:37.292 --> 05:04:38.126
AND I THINK I SHOULD WRITE

05:04:38.193 --> 05:04:39.828
BECAUSE I WILL GO UP NOT WHERE

05:04:39.894 --> 05:04:40.695

HIGH LEVEL PERSPECTIVE WE JUST

05:05:37.786 --> 05:05:39.054

ANY DEFINITION OF ANY COURSE

THIS BILL DOES NOT DO THAT.

05:06:00.642 --> 05:06:01.376
WE'VE STATED THAT FOR

SHALL BE GRANTED UPON SHOWING OF

06:07:07.038 --> 06:07:09.207
QUOTE UNQUOTE GOOD BECAUSE.

06:07:09.273 --> 06:07:10.708
HOWEVER UNLIKE OTHER AREAS OF

06:07:10.775 --> 06:07:12.210
LAW THE STATUTE DOES NOT DEFINE

06:07:12.276 --> 06:07:14.045
WHAT GOOD CAUSE IS.

06:07:14.112 --> 06:07:15.847
SO WE HAVE SITUATIONS WHERE THE

06:07:15.913 --> 06:07:17.048
HEARINGS ARE SET AT A TIME

06:07:17.115 --> 06:07:18.616

THIS.

06:07:30.228 --> 06:07:31.729
PROLONGS DISPUTES AND MAKE

06:07:31.796 --> 06:07:33.564
SETTLEMENT DIFFICULT.

06:07:33.631 --> 06:07:35.032
AND IT DRIES UP COST FOR BOTH

06:07:35.099 --> 06:07:37.268
SIDES AND ACTUALLY IN SOME CASES

06:07:37.335 --> 06:07:39.036
CAN HAMPER OUR KIDS FROM GETTING

06:07:39.103 --> 06:07:40.738
SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES IN A

06:07:40.805 --> 06:07:42.707
TIMELY WAY. IT'S THIS BILL WOULD

06:07:42.774 --> 06:07:44.108
DO TWO THINGS THAT WOULD CLARIFY

06:07:44.175 --> 06:07:45.843
IN STATUTE THE STANDARD FOR GOOD

06:07:45.910 --> 06:07:47.412

06:07:47.478 --> 06:07:47.879
HEARING.

06:07:47.945 --> 06:07:50.281
.

06:07:50.348 --> 06:07:51.849
IT IT WOULD CLARIFY THE STANDARD

06:07:51.916 --> 06:07:52.417
FOR BECAUSE IT WAS SPECIFIED

06:07:52.483 --> 06:07:53.618
THAT.

06:07:53.684 --> 06:07:55.119
THEY'RE TWO GROUNDS ACCOUNTS TO

06:07:55.186 --> 06:07:56.120
GOOD CAUSE FOR A ONE TIME

06:07:56.187 --> 06:07:57.755
CONTINUATION HEARING.

06:07:57.822 --> 06:07:59.290
THE FIRST ONE IS WHEN A MATERIAL

06:07:59.357 --> 06:08:00.958
WITNESS IS ABSENT.

06:08:01.025 --> 06:08:02.627
DO TO THE HEARING DATE BEING SAT

06:08:02.693 --> 06:08:03.261
ON A DAY WHEN THE SCHOOL WAS NOT

06:08:03.327 --> 06:08:05.029
IN SESSION.

06:08:05.096 --> 06:08:06.230
AND THE OTHER IS WHERE BOTH

06:08:06.297 --> 06:08:08.966
PARTIES BOTH PARTIES STIPULATE

06:08:09.033 --> 06:08:10.401
THAT EXTENSIONS NECESSARY TO

06:08:10.468 --> 06:08:11.269
RESOLVE THE MATTER. BY

06:08:11.335 --> 06:08:13.371
SETTLEMENT.

06:08:13.438 --> 06:08:14.705
A SOMETIME SCHOOL BOARDS CANNOT

06:08:14.772 --> 06:08:16.174
A ENACT A SETTLEMENT BECAUSE

06:08:16.240 --> 06:08:17.408
THEY'RE NOT MEETING OVERWINTERED

06:08:17.475 --> 06:08:18.509
THEY CAN'T.

06:08:18.576 --> 06:08:21.112
VOTE ON IT AND SO YOU'VE GOT

06:08:21.179 --> 06:08:22.246
HEARING DATES THAT ARE DRIVING

06:08:22.313 --> 06:08:23.881

06:08:31.022 --> 06:08:32.590
GROUNDS.

06:08:32.657 --> 06:08:34.025
I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR

06:08:34.091 --> 06:08:36.327
TEACHERS GOOD FOR SCHOOL STAFF

06:08:36.394 --> 06:08:39.330
