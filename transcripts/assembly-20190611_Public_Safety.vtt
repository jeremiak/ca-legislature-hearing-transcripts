PROVE TO ME THAT THIS IS A

00:40:57.488 --> 00:40:57.655
PROBLEM.

A LOT OF THE CONSIDERATIONS THAT

00:41:03.828 --> 00:41:05.062
ARE BEING.

00:41:05.129 --> 00:41:07.198
BENNETT ABOUT FORGET RURAL

00:41:07.264 --> 00:41:09.500
COMMUNITIES RURAL COMMUNITIES AT

00:41:09.567 --> 00:41:12.503
AND THE ALSO THE THE NATURE OF

00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:13.904
RURAL COMMUNITIES.

00:41:13.971 --> 00:41:16.307
AS MUCH DIFFERENT WHERE THERE'S

00:41:16.373 --> 00:41:16.807
A LOT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:41:16.874 --> 00:41:18.142
AVAILABLE.

00:41:18.209 --> 00:41:20.244
IN THESE KIND OF CIRCUMSTANCES

00:41:20.311 --> 00:41:22.913
GO TO THE ESPECIALLY.

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:24.982
DESERT COMMUNITIES -- IN THE

00:41:25.049 --> 00:41:27.084
SOUTH. TO THE NORTH THERE ARE

00:41:27.151 --> 00:41:30.321
MANY MANY REMOTE AREAS WHERE --

00:41:30.387 --> 00:41:33.057
ASSISTANCE WOULD BE.

00:41:33.123 --> 00:41:34.191
NEEDED AND I'D I'D I JUST FIND

00:41:34.258 --> 00:41:35.659
THIS TO BE.

00:41:35.726 --> 00:41:36.861
INTERESTING NORMALLY WHEN WE

00:41:36.927 --> 00:41:38.095
CREATE STATUTES WE HAVE TO SHOW

00:41:38.162 --> 00:41:39.897
A PROBLEM BEFORE WE ADDRESS IT

00:41:39.964 --> 00:41:40.764
AND I DON'T SEE THIS AS BEING A

00:41:40.831 --> 00:41:42.266
PROBLEM.

00:41:42.333 --> 00:41:43.267
SEVERAL TROUBLE WITH IT

00:41:43.334 --> 00:41:43.567

IMPORTANT THAT WE TAKE OFF AS

00:41:52.977 --> 00:41:54.311
MANY OLD IN BAD BILLS AS

00:41:54.378 --> 00:41:55.813
POSSIBLE FROM THE BOOKS AND I

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:57.915
THINK RESPECTFUL DISOBEDIENCE.

00:41:57.982 --> 00:41:59.783
AND SELF DETERMINATION IS OKAY

00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:01.585

KNOW.

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:21.105
THERE IS A LEGITIMATE PUBLIC

00:42:21.171 --> 00:42:23.274
POLICY PURPOSE TO TAKE DEAD

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:24.808
LETTER LAWS OFF THE BOOKS.

00:42:24.875 --> 00:42:26.410
THERE IS A PURPOSE THERE IS

00:42:26.477 --> 00:42:27.745
INSPIRING CONFIDENCE IN THE

00:42:27.811 --> 00:42:29.680
GOVERNMENT AND TO THE PEOPLE WE

00:42:29.747 --> 00:42:30.981
REPRESENT THAT SOMETIMES STUFF

00:42:31.048 --> 00:42:32.650
IS NO LONGER NECESSARY TO BE A

00:42:32.716 --> 00:42:33.417
LAW.

00:42:33.484 --> 00:42:34.985
THAT THE SYSTEM ONLY PRODUCES

00:42:35.052 --> 00:42:36.887
MORE AND MORE AND MORE LAWS AND

00:42:36.954 --> 00:42:38.722
THICKER BOOKS IN THAT PART OF

00:42:38.789 --> 00:42:40.524
OUR OBLIGATION IS TO CONTINUE TO

00:42:40.591 --> 00:42:42.493
LOOK BACK. TO RECONSIDER AND TO

00:42:42.559 --> 00:42:43.727
THINK THAT STUFF THROUGH IN

00:42:43.794 --> 00:42:45.629
EXACTLY THE POINT THAT IT HASN'T

00:42:45.696 --> 00:42:48.165
BEEN USED TO ME INFORMS EXACTLY

00:42:48.232 --> 00:42:49.466
THE REASON WHY IT DOESN'T NEED

00:42:49.533 --> 00:42:50.734
TO BE ON THE BOOKS.

00:42:50.801 --> 00:42:51.969
BECAUSE IT HASN'T BEEN USED SO

00:42:52.036 --> 00:42:53.871
YOU DO SERVE A PURPOSE THE THE

00:42:53.938 --> 00:42:55.239
THE INDEED THE SHERIFFS HAVE

00:42:55.306 --> 00:42:57.341
BEEN OPPOSING BUT WE ASK THEM IN

00:42:57.408 --> 00:42:59.944
MARCH OF ANY INSTANCE WHAT IS

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:01.111
BEEN USED AND WE'VE GOTTEN NO

00:43:01.178 --> 00:43:02.413
RESPONSE THE LAST THING WE COULD

00:43:02.479 --> 00:43:04.915
FIND WAS IN.

00:43:04.982 --> 00:43:05.482
NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE AND THE

00:43:05.549 --> 00:43:06.650
QUESTION FROM A PUBLIC POLICY

00:43:06.717 --> 00:43:11.088
PERSPECTIVE IS WE HAVE ONE TWO

00:43:11.155 --> 00:43:11.722
THREE FOUR FIVE SIX LAWS ON THE

00:43:11.789 --> 00:43:12.623
BOOKS THAT ALREADY.

00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:15.059
REQUIRE A PEOPLE TO BE INVOLVED

00:43:15.125 --> 00:43:16.627
BUT THIS DOESN'T JUST SAY A FINE

00:43:16.694 --> 00:43:18.095
THIS MAKES IT A MISDEMEANOR YOU

00:43:18.162 --> 00:43:20.064
PUT SOMEBODY IN JAIL FOR FAILING

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:20.764
TO DO SO.

00:43:20.831 --> 00:43:22.433
THAT TO ME IS DIFFERENT AND THE

00:43:22.499 --> 00:43:24.234
LAST ISSUE A RURAL COMMUNITIES

00:43:24.301 --> 00:43:26.003
THE EVIDENCE AS WE BEGAN TO LOOK

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:27.705
AT IT IS THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO

00:43:27.771 --> 00:43:29.139
PUT SOMEBODY IN JAIL AND TO

00:43:29.206 --> 00:43:31.375
FORCE THEM TO CONSCRIPT THEM. TO

00:43:31.442 --> 00:43:32.843
HELP YOU BECAUSE GENERALLY IN

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:34.078
SMALLER RURAL COMMUNITIES PEOPLE

00:43:34.144 --> 00:43:35.379
KNOW EACH OTHER AND IT'S A

00:43:35.446 --> 00:43:37.014
VOLUNTARY ENVIRONMENT WHERE

00:43:37.081 --> 00:43:39.616
EVERYBODY'S TRYING TO HELP.

00:43:39.683 --> 00:43:43.020

WHERE I LOOK AT ALL THE PLANNING

00:43:51.462 --> 00:43:52.496

ANGELES HAMMER AND I CUT THAT IN

00:43:53.864 --> 00:43:55.265
HALF I REMEMBER HAVING KIND OF

00:43:55.332 --> 00:43:56.033
THE SAME ARGUMENT?

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:57.201
WHY DO WE STILL HAVE THESE

00:43:57.267 --> 00:43:58.335
PLANNING CODES IN HERE WHEN I

00:43:58.402 --> 00:43:59.570
HAD BEEN USED?

00:43:59.636 --> 00:44:00.671
NOT AS LONG AS THE EIGHTEEN

00:44:00.738 --> 00:44:03.040
HUNDREDS BUT THE EARLY NINETEEN

00:44:03.107 --> 00:44:04.141
HUNDREDS UP.

00:44:04.208 --> 00:44:07.945

00:44:08.012 --> 00:44:09.246
GET A PROBLEM WE HAD WE HAD.

00:44:09.313 --> 00:44:10.581
RULES ON THE BOOKS THAT WERE

00:44:10.647 --> 00:44:12.883
CREATED BY BUREAUCRATS WITHIN

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:14.318
THE SYSTEM WHO FOUGHT TO KEEP IT

00:44:14.385 --> 00:44:16.387
EVEN THOUGH THEY NO LONGER HAD A

00:44:16.453 --> 00:44:17.087
PURPOSE.

00:44:17.154 --> 00:44:19.556
OR WE COULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING

00:44:19.623 --> 00:44:21.458
MUCH EASIER.

00:44:21.525 --> 00:44:23.627
AND LESS COMPLICATED -- ULTIMA

00:44:23.694 --> 00:44:25.596
REDUCED THE PLANNING BOOK FROM

00:44:25.662 --> 00:44:27.131

WHICH MEANS THEY COULD ABSORB

00:51:57.514 --> 00:52:00.584
THE JJ'S POPULATION MORE THAN

00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:02.819

TODAY -- I I WANT TO START WITH

01:00:37.333 --> 01:00:38.267
THE FACT THAT WE PROBATION SHE'S

01:00:38.334 --> 01:00:39.702

01:00:42.905 --> 01:00:44.874
THE LEADERSHIP OF PROBATION --

01:00:47.844 --> 01:00:49.479
TO DO THAT OVER SEVERAL SEVERAL --

01:00:49.545 --> 01:00:51.414
AT MANY YEARS AND WE HAVE

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:52.582
DEMONSTRATED THAT COMMITMENT

01:00:52.648 --> 01:00:55.351
THROUGH A 74% REDUCTION -- OF

01:00:55.418 --> 01:00:57.787

01:00:57.854 --> 01:00:59.489

IN ITS ENTIRETY -- AND AND DJJ

01:01:01.991 --> 01:01:03.726
REALLY DOES REPRESENTS -- NOT

01:01:03.793 --> 01:01:04.827
THE FIRST CHOICE FOR FOR

01:01:04.894 --> 01:01:06.062
COUNTIES ARE LOCAL COURTS BUT

01:01:06.129 --> 01:01:07.497
REALLY FOR THOSE YOUTH THAT

01:01:07.563 --> 01:01:09.132
REPRESENT ON THE HIGHEST RISK OF

01:01:09.198 --> 01:01:10.666
RE OFFENDING THE HIGHEST NEEDS

01:01:10.733 --> 01:01:11.467
OR WHO ARE IN NEED OF

01:01:11.534 --> 01:01:12.902
SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS THAT.

01:01:12.969 --> 01:01:14.470
THAT COUNTIES DO NOT HAVE AN AND

01:01:14.537 --> 01:01:15.838
THOSE ARE REALLY THE PRINCIPLES

01:01:15.905 --> 01:01:18.307
IN WHICH WE OPERATE UNDER -- IT

01:01:18.374 --> 01:01:19.942
IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE

01:01:20.009 --> 01:01:21.444
SLIDING SCALE THAT THIS BILL

01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:22.412
KIND OF SEEKS.

01:01:22.478 --> 01:01:24.313
TO RE INSTITUTE WAS WAS REALLY

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:25.882
PUT IN PLACE MANY YEARS AGO AT A

01:01:25.948 --> 01:01:27.417
TIME WHEN DJJ POPULATION WAS AT

01:01:27.483 --> 01:01:29.585
ITS HIGHEST AND SO THE FOCUS WAS

01:01:29.652 --> 01:01:31.721
ON HOW DO WE INCENTIVIZE TO KEEP.

01:01:31.788 --> 01:01:34.190
A MORE YOUTH LOCALLY SB EIGHTY

01:01:34.257 --> 01:01:35.291

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:36.626
SET IN MOTION PROBATION COMING

01:01:36.692 --> 01:01:37.994
TO THE TABLE AND SAYING WE WE

01:01:38.061 --> 01:01:39.429
WANT TO KEEP THESE KIDS LOCALLY

01:01:39.495 --> 01:01:41.030
WE THINK THIS MAKES SENSE.

01:01:41.097 --> 01:01:42.131
AND THOSE YOU NOW ARE KEPT

01:01:42.198 --> 01:01:43.433
LOCALLY MANY OF WHICH YOU ARE

01:01:43.499 --> 01:01:45.268
ACTUALLY IN OUR COMMUNITY BEING

01:01:45.334 --> 01:01:47.270
SERVED AND NOT EVEN AND OUR

01:01:47.336 --> 01:01:48.071
HALLS.

01:01:48.137 --> 01:01:49.772
AND SO REINSTITUTING THIS --

01:01:49.839 --> 01:01:51.074
SLIDING SCALE AT A TIME NOW

01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:52.809
WHERE DJ POPULATION IS AT ITS

01:01:52.875 --> 01:01:54.777
LOWEST -- REALLY DOESN'T FIT

01:01:54.844 --> 01:01:55.778
TOGETHER ALL OF THE PIECES AND

01:01:55.845 --> 01:01:57.080
DYNAMICS THAT WE KNOW TO BE TRUE

01:01:57.146 --> 01:01:58.614
ABOUT HOW THE SYSTEM CURRENTLY

01:01:58.681 --> 01:02:00.550
LOOKS -- AND WE ARE VERY MUCH

01:02:00.616 --> 01:02:02.752
CONCERNED THAT JUST INCREASING

01:02:02.819 --> 01:02:04.787
THE FEE ABSENT ALL OF THESE

01:02:04.854 --> 01:02:06.155
OTHER DYNAMICS IS GOING.

01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:07.290
TO LOCAL PRESSURES ON THE

01:02:07.356 --> 01:02:08.858
FUNDING THAT WE CURRENTLY ARE

01:02:08.925 --> 01:02:11.060
USING TO INFUSE THE LOCAL SYSTEM

01:02:11.127 --> 01:02:13.629
WHICH IS TO KEEP KIDS OUT OF DJJ

01:02:13.696 --> 01:02:14.730
KEEP KIDS OUT OF R. HALLS AND

01:02:14.797 --> 01:02:16.232
KEEP THEM IN THE COMMUNITY WHERE

01:02:16.299 --> 01:02:18.067
WHERE POSSIBLE AND SO --

01:02:18.134 --> 01:02:19.769
DIVERTING FUNDING TO PAY AN

01:02:19.836 --> 01:02:21.537
ADDITIONAL COST TO DJ IS GOING

01:02:21.604 --> 01:02:23.239
TO HAVE OTHER SYSTEM IMPACTS AND

01:02:23.306 --> 01:02:24.841
WE ARE VERY MUCH CONCERNED ABOUT.

01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:27.043
NOT WANTING TO MAKE THOSE SHIFTS

01:02:27.110 --> 01:02:31.314

AND COMMUNITY ARE THOSE GUIDING

01:02:35.251 --> 01:02:36.452
PRINCIPLES OF OF KIND OF HOW WE

01:02:36.519 --> 01:02:37.753
OPERATE IN WHO GOES TO DJJ AND

01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:38.988

MS SANCHEZ INDICATED -- AND

01:03:29.539 --> 01:03:31.107
APPRECIATE THE BENEFITS OF

KEEPING KIDS LOCALLY IN IN

01:03:32.408 --> 01:03:33.643
ABSOLUTELY EVERY INSTANCE THAT

01:03:33.709 --> 01:03:34.710
WE CAN.

01:03:34.777 --> 01:03:37.146

01:03:37.213 --> 01:03:38.848
DEEP END AT THE THE HIGH NEED

01:03:38.915 --> 01:03:40.950
AND OF THE CONTINUING WE DO

01:03:41.017 --> 01:03:42.151
BELIEVE THAT THE STATE HAS A

01:03:42.218 --> 01:03:44.854
ROLE IN PROVIDING SERVICES AND

01:03:44.921 --> 01:03:45.721
SPECIALIZED TREATMENT THAT

I'LL MOVE IT IN A MOMENT BUT

01:05:27.256 --> 01:05:29.325
FIRST I'D LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT

01:05:29.392 --> 01:05:31.294
TO THE OPPOSITION -- THIS BILL

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:33.296
DID GET THIRTY VOTES IN THE

01:05:33.362 --> 01:05:34.230
SENATE.

01:05:34.297 --> 01:05:36.198
I DO NOT THINK THAT THE AUTHOR

01:05:36.265 --> 01:05:38.401
PLANS TO SHUT DOWN DJJ I THINK

01:05:38.467 --> 01:05:40.636
THE COMMENTS ABOUT CERTAIN KIDS

01:05:40.703 --> 01:05:42.605
BEING SERVED BASS.

01:05:42.672 --> 01:05:44.273
THEY'RE PROBABLY MAKES SENSE.

01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:46.042
BUT WHAT I ALSO SEE IS A GREAT

01:05:46.108 --> 01:05:47.310
DISPARITY.

01:05:47.376 --> 01:05:49.211
ALAMEDA COUNTY HAS THE CITY OF

01:05:49.278 --> 01:05:51.814
OAKLAND KNOWN FOR UNFORTUNATELY

01:05:51.881 --> 01:05:53.015
HAVING A LOT OF YOUTH VIOLENCE.

01:05:53.082 --> 01:05:54.717
YES.

01:05:54.784 --> 01:05:58.020
WELL IT'S 50% LARGER THAN CONTRA

01:05:58.087 --> 01:06:01.891
COSTA COUNTY -- WHICH HAS MUCH

01:06:01.957 --> 01:06:04.727
LESS OF AN URBAN -- USE OF

01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:06.996
VIOLENCE PROBLEM THEY SAID TWICE

01:06:07.063 --> 01:06:09.231
AS MANY PEOPLE TO D. J. J..

01:06:09.298 --> 01:06:11.067
ARM YOU LOOK AT IT AND

01:06:11.133 --> 01:06:12.902
THROUGHOUT THE STATE YOU WILL

01:06:12.968 --> 01:06:15.438
SEE COUNTIES THAT STICK OUT.

01:06:15.504 --> 01:06:16.806
AS SENDING MANY MORE PEOPLE.

01:06:16.872 --> 01:06:18.641
NOW IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT THIS

01:06:18.708 --> 01:06:20.643

01:06:22.878 --> 01:06:24.814
WORRIED ABOUT THE MONEY THAT IT

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:25.414
COSTS.

01:06:25.481 --> 01:06:27.083
TO SMALLER COUNTIES THAT YOU

01:06:27.149 --> 01:06:30.720
SUGGEST -- SOME REDISTRIBUTION

01:06:30.786 --> 01:06:33.189
OF BUT I WOULD DEFINITELY LOOK

01:06:33.255 --> 01:06:34.890
FOR SOME SORT OF COMPROMISE ON

01:06:34.957 --> 01:06:36.926
THIS AGAIN I DO THINK D. J. J.

01:06:36.992 --> 01:06:39.161
MAKE SENSE. FOR MANY KIDS I'M

01:06:39.228 --> 01:06:40.963
JUST CONCERNED WHEN I SEE THIS

01:06:41.030 --> 01:06:42.164
DISPARITY.

01:06:42.231 --> 01:06:44.233
THAT NOT ALL THE KIDS WHO SHOULD

01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:46.268
BE SENT THERE ARE SENT THERE AND

01:06:46.335 --> 01:06:47.269
THAT I'M WORRIED THAT SOME OF

01:06:47.336 --> 01:06:49.705
THOSE SHOULD BE KEPT LOCALLY.

01:06:49.772 --> 01:06:51.040
OF FOR THAT REASON AGAIN I'M

01:06:51.107 --> 01:06:53.442
SUPPORTING THIS BILL AND I MOVED

01:06:53.509 --> 01:06:57.813
TO BELL.

01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:58.981
ANY OTHER CON JUST BARKING.

01:06:59.048 --> 01:06:59.982
THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR COMMENTS

01:07:00.049 --> 01:07:01.617
DR THE COUPLE QUESTIONS ONE IS

01:07:01.684 --> 01:07:02.885
YOU MENTIONED THE RECIDIVISM

01:07:02.952 --> 01:07:04.453
RATE AT THE STATE FACILITIES YOU

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:05.287
KNOW WHAT THE COMPARABLE

01:07:05.354 --> 01:07:07.056
RECIDIVISM RATE IS AT THE LOCAL

01:07:07.123 --> 01:07:09.525
FACILITIES.

01:07:09.592 --> 01:07:11.160
SAID THAT DATA ISN'T COLLECTED

01:07:11.227 --> 01:07:13.162
OKAY.

01:07:13.229 --> 01:07:14.330
HERE THAT A LOT FOR THE COUNTIES.

01:07:14.397 --> 01:07:16.065
I'M SO I GUESS I WOULD ASK WHAT

01:07:16.132 --> 01:07:17.967
YOUR COMMENT IS TO THE

01:07:18.033 --> 01:07:19.301
SPECIALIZED NEEDS.

01:07:19.368 --> 01:07:21.237
OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO BRING SAT

01:07:21.303 --> 01:07:22.772
I MEAN I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT.

01:07:22.838 --> 01:07:24.440
IN ALL PRISON POPULATION STAYING

01:07:24.507 --> 01:07:26.342
CLOSER TO HOME IS BETTER FOR THE

01:07:26.409 --> 01:07:27.943
PRISONERS AND FOR RECIDIVISM

01:07:28.010 --> 01:07:30.179
RATES -- BUT THAT BEING SAID I

01:07:30.246 --> 01:07:31.680
THINK AS WE'VE MOVED TO MORE OF

01:07:31.747 --> 01:07:33.449
A SYSTEM THAT HOLDS PEOPLE

01:07:33.516 --> 01:07:34.817
COUNTIES WE ALSO SEE.

01:07:34.884 --> 01:07:36.986
SOME PLACES LAST PROGRAMMING

01:07:37.052 --> 01:07:38.554
RIGHT AND THAT IN SOME CASES

01:07:38.621 --> 01:07:40.589
THERE ARE IT ISN'T LEADING

01:07:40.656 --> 01:07:42.057
NECESSARILY TO BETTER RESULTS IN

01:07:42.124 --> 01:07:43.192
HERE WE DON'T HAVE ANY DATA TO

01:07:43.259 --> 01:07:45.428
WHETHER THAT'S TRUE OR NOT.

01:07:45.494 --> 01:07:47.530
AND SO I GUESS I WOULD ASK WHAT.

01:07:47.596 --> 01:07:51.066
IN THE BILL YOU USE AND SORT OF

01:07:51.133 --> 01:07:53.736
WHAT I WOULD THINK IS A ROUGH --

01:07:53.803 --> 01:07:56.105
CORRELATOR WITH THE TYPE OF

01:07:56.172 --> 01:07:57.440
CRIME COMMITTED SEVEN YEARS.

01:07:57.506 --> 01:07:59.442
VERSES I'M MORE SPECIALIZED

01:07:59.508 --> 01:08:00.810
DETERMINANT OF WHETHER SOMEONE

01:08:00.876 --> 01:08:02.044
NEEDS ONE OF THE SPECIALIZED

01:08:02.111 --> 01:08:03.479
PROGRAMS AND SO I WOULD ASK HER

01:08:03.546 --> 01:08:04.947
WHAT YOUR RESPONSES AND WHY.

01:08:05.014 --> 01:08:07.483
THE DECISION WASN'T MADE.

01:08:07.550 --> 01:08:09.118
TO TO REALLY TAYLOR THIS BILL SO

01:08:09.185 --> 01:08:09.919
THAT THOSE WHO NEED THE

01:08:09.985 --> 01:08:10.920
SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS THAT THE

01:08:10.986 --> 01:08:12.588
STATE IS PROVIDING CAN CONTINUE

01:08:12.655 --> 01:08:15.157
TO BE SENT AND WE ARE KEEPING

01:08:15.224 --> 01:08:15.724
THE PEOPLE CLOSE TO HOME WHO

01:08:15.791 --> 01:08:18.227
NEED IT.

01:08:18.294 --> 01:08:21.130
WELL JUST YOU KNOW -- KIND OF

01:08:21.197 --> 01:08:21.664
GIVE YOU YOU ASKED WHAT MY

01:08:21.730 --> 01:08:25.100
REASONS WORK I THINK I THINK YES

01:08:25.167 --> 01:08:25.367
THEY ARE.

01:08:25.434 --> 01:08:30.172
THE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND

01:08:30.239 --> 01:08:33.175
FOR THOSE WHICH HAVE LESS THE

01:08:33.242 --> 01:08:34.543
FEARS SERIOUS CRIMES.

01:08:34.610 --> 01:08:37.646
AND OR COMMITTED A CRIME UNDER.

01:08:37.713 --> 01:08:38.781
SIXTEEN AND THEN DOES IT HAVE

01:08:38.848 --> 01:08:40.349
THE MORE SERIOUS CRIMES WE

01:08:40.416 --> 01:08:42.017
RECOGNIZE.

01:08:42.084 --> 01:08:43.085
THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE.

01:08:43.152 --> 01:08:45.654
THAT WE LEFT AT THE TWENTY FOUR

01:08:45.721 --> 01:08:47.590
THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THOSE PEOPLE

01:08:47.656 --> 01:08:49.391
WILL CONTINUE TO COME TO THE

01:08:49.458 --> 01:08:51.260
FACILITY IF A COUNTY WANTED TO

01:08:51.327 --> 01:08:53.028
SEND THE LESSER.

01:08:53.095 --> 01:08:55.865
OFFENDING -- GROUP TO THE

01:08:55.931 --> 01:08:57.566
FACILITY THEY CAN WE'RE NOT

01:08:57.633 --> 01:08:59.668
RESTRICTING THEM IN ANY WAY --

01:08:59.735 --> 01:09:01.370
THEY JUST HAVE TO PAY WHAT WE

01:09:01.437 --> 01:09:04.607
CONSIDER TO BE.

01:09:04.673 --> 01:09:06.675
A FAIR WHICH IS LESS THAN HALF

01:09:06.742 --> 01:09:09.111
OF THE COST.

01:09:09.178 --> 01:09:12.314
LESS THAN HALF THE COST.

01:09:12.381 --> 01:09:13.782
AND SINCE I'M ON THE BUDGET

01:09:13.849 --> 01:09:15.217
SUBCOMMITTEE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY

01:09:15.284 --> 01:09:18.754
IN THE SENATE -- I'M THE ONE

01:09:18.821 --> 01:09:20.155
THAT LOOKS AT THE BUDGET.

01:09:20.222 --> 01:09:22.258
AND I OBSERVED THAT WE GET OF

01:09:22.324 --> 01:09:23.993
THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM

01:09:24.059 --> 01:09:25.494
COUNTY SIX HUNDRED MILLION

01:09:25.561 --> 01:09:26.962
DOLLARS A YEAR.

01:09:27.029 --> 01:09:29.365
OKAY SO WEAK WE GIVE THEM GIVE

01:09:29.431 --> 01:09:30.900
BLOCK GRANTS TO THE JUSTICE

01:09:30.966 --> 01:09:33.035
BROWN -- WE GIVE THEM THREE

01:09:33.102 --> 01:09:35.204
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS -- FOR

01:09:35.271 --> 01:09:37.306
THEIR FACILITIES WHICH ARE YOU

01:09:37.373 --> 01:09:37.973
KNOW UNDER CONSTRUCTION AT THIS

01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:38.641
TIME.

01:09:38.707 --> 01:09:41.410
AND THEY STILL HAVE --

01:09:41.477 --> 01:09:42.077
FACILITIES THAT ARE ONLY A THIRD

01:09:42.144 --> 01:09:43.112
FULL.

01:09:43.178 --> 01:09:44.647
SO WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN

01:09:44.713 --> 01:09:46.315
THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS

01:09:46.382 --> 01:09:47.983
THERE SERVE THIS REALIGNMENT

01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:50.586
TAKING PLACE WERE MOVING OVER TO

01:09:50.653 --> 01:09:51.954
THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH'S --

01:09:52.021 --> 01:09:54.924
HUMAN SERVICES -- WERE FOCUSED

01:09:54.990 --> 01:09:57.560
ON MAY.

01:09:57.626 --> 01:10:00.796
LOOK AT OUR FACILITIES IN A

01:10:00.863 --> 01:10:02.531
DIFFERENT WAY AND MAYBE

01:10:02.598 --> 01:10:03.999
READJUSTING OUR FACILITIES OVER

01:10:04.066 --> 01:10:06.835
TIME -- YOU MIGHT SEE.

01:10:06.902 --> 01:10:08.804
MAYBE SMALLER FACILITIES

01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:10.372
OPERATED BY THE STATE YOU MIGHT

01:10:10.439 --> 01:10:11.173
SEE.

01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:14.176
CONTRACTS WITH CERTAIN COUNTIES

01:10:14.243 --> 01:10:14.944
TO OPERATE.

01:10:15.010 --> 01:10:16.412
WHAT I CALL THE INTERMEDIATE

01:10:16.478 --> 01:10:19.381
LEVEL TYPE OF FACILITIES THAT

01:10:19.448 --> 01:10:20.983
OTHER COUNTIES COULD SEND?

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:23.052
YOUNG PEOPLE -- TO THOSE KINDS

01:10:23.118 --> 01:10:25.287
OF THINGS WILL HAPPEN -- I THINK

01:10:25.354 --> 01:10:27.056
WE ALL KNOW THAT THE SYSTEM'S

01:10:27.122 --> 01:10:28.490
NOT GOING TO STAY THE SAME IT'S

01:10:28.557 --> 01:10:29.692
GOING TO CHANGE.

01:10:29.758 --> 01:10:32.394
OF WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO OPERATE

01:10:32.461 --> 01:10:33.429
THIS FACILITIES.

01:10:33.495 --> 01:10:35.831
ONLY WITH A THIRD OF THE PEOPLE

01:10:35.898 --> 01:10:39.702
AND AT THREE FOUR HUNDRED

01:10:39.768 --> 01:10:40.703
THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR IT'S

01:10:40.769 --> 01:10:41.737
MONEY THAT.

01:10:41.804 --> 01:10:43.172
WE HOPE WILL SPENT WE CAN SPEND

01:10:43.238 --> 01:10:44.840
IT ON THE YOUNG PEOPLE IN

01:10:44.907 --> 01:10:46.875
ANOTHER WAY THAT WILL REDUCE

01:10:46.942 --> 01:10:48.143
RECIDIVISM.

01:10:48.210 --> 01:10:49.478
SO I THINK THERE'S THIS

01:10:49.545 --> 01:10:51.046
REALIGNMENT TAKING PLACE.

01:10:51.113 --> 01:10:53.649
RIGHT NOW OF THIS BILL DOESN'T

01:10:53.716 --> 01:10:55.417
SOLVE ALL THOSE REALIGNMENT

01:10:55.484 --> 01:10:56.785
ISSUES.

01:10:56.852 --> 01:10:58.287
THIS COMMITTEE AND AND OUR

01:10:58.354 --> 01:10:59.388
BUDGET COMMITTEE AND OTHER

01:10:59.455 --> 01:11:01.457
PEOPLE SHOULD BE THE GOVERNOR

01:11:01.523 --> 01:11:03.125
SHOULD BE -- FOCUSED ON THIS

01:11:03.192 --> 01:11:04.927
SUBJECT OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL

01:11:04.994 --> 01:11:06.729
YEARS SO BIG PITCHER.

01:11:06.795 --> 01:11:10.766
ISSUE BUT BUT FOR OUR BILL -- WE

01:11:10.833 --> 01:11:12.001
THINK THIS IS THE WAY.

01:11:12.067 --> 01:11:13.669
TO MAYBE SIGNIFY THAT WE NEED TO

01:11:13.736 --> 01:11:14.737
CHANGE WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW

01:11:14.803 --> 01:11:17.039
SAYS RIGHT NOW IS NOT WORKING.

01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:18.607
FOR ANYBODY.

01:11:18.674 --> 01:11:19.975
SO THE OFFENSE THAT THE

01:11:20.042 --> 01:11:22.144
OPPOSITION CITED WAS YOUTH SEX

01:11:22.211 --> 01:11:24.279
OFFENDERS WOULD THEY FALL AND I

01:11:24.346 --> 01:11:25.614
APOLOGIZE I DON'T KNOWWHAT THE

01:11:25.681 --> 01:11:26.749
SENTENCE ON THAT IS WOULD THEY

01:11:26.815 --> 01:11:28.550
FALL UNDER THE SEVEN YEARS ARE

01:11:28.617 --> 01:11:31.120
OVER THE SEVEN YEARS.

01:11:31.186 --> 01:11:32.588
DOING NOW ANYBODY.

01:11:32.655 --> 01:11:33.689
YEAH THAT'S THE SEVEN YEAR

01:11:33.756 --> 01:11:35.257
AGGREGATES -- SENTENCE SO IT

01:11:35.324 --> 01:11:40.029
WILL BE A CASE BY CASE BASIS --

01:11:40.095 --> 01:11:42.197
BUT I MEAN I THINK IT'S AN

01:11:42.264 --> 01:11:43.766
IMPORTANT ALSO TO POINT OUT THAT

01:11:43.832 --> 01:11:46.135
THE THE THERE IS A PROGRAM FOR

01:11:46.201 --> 01:11:48.437
YOU FOR SEX OFFENSES AT DJJ WE

01:11:48.504 --> 01:11:50.039
HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS.

01:11:50.105 --> 01:11:52.007
ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THAT

01:11:52.074 --> 01:11:57.346
PROGRAM AND THE AT TREATMENT OF

01:11:57.413 --> 01:11:58.547
USE THAT ARE COMING INTO THE

01:11:58.614 --> 01:12:00.716
FACILITIES WITH SEX OFFENSES AT

01:12:00.783 --> 01:12:02.484
DJJ.

01:12:02.551 --> 01:12:03.118
SO I GUESS I WOULD URGE AND WE

01:12:03.185 --> 01:12:04.253
HEAR THIS A LOT FROM THE WAY

01:12:04.319 --> 01:12:06.288
WE'VE MOVED IN THE PRISON SYSTEM

01:12:06.355 --> 01:12:07.990
IS WE DON'T HAVE GOOD DATA ON

01:12:08.057 --> 01:12:09.324
WHAT IS WORKING AND WHAT IS NOT

01:12:09.391 --> 01:12:10.926
AT THE STATE LEVEL AND AT THE

01:12:10.993 --> 01:12:11.927
COUNTY LEVEL.

01:12:11.994 --> 01:12:13.562
AND I THINK THAT.

01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:14.930
I URGE ALL OF US TO BE MAKING

01:12:14.997 --> 01:12:16.665
MORE INFORMED DECISIONS WE

01:12:16.732 --> 01:12:17.966
SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT IF

01:12:18.033 --> 01:12:19.902
THOSE PROGRAMS ARE WORKING IF

01:12:19.968 --> 01:12:21.303
THOSE PEOPLE ARE -- ACIDITY TING

01:12:21.370 --> 01:12:22.738
OR NOT AND THAT WE SHOULD BE

01:12:22.805 --> 01:12:24.773
MAKING DATA DRIVEN INFORMED

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:26.041
DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT IS BEST FOR

01:12:26.108 --> 01:12:27.609
OUR YOUTH AND HOW TO TREAT THEM.

01:12:27.676 --> 01:12:28.510
AND WE KNOW THE BEING CLOSE TO

01:12:28.577 --> 01:12:30.045
HOME IS BEST FOR YOU BUT WE ALSO

01:12:30.112 --> 01:12:31.246
KNOW THE GETTING THE TREATMENT

01:12:31.313 --> 01:12:32.715
THEY NEED IS BEST FOR YOU.

01:12:32.781 --> 01:12:34.650
AND SO HOW DO WE FIND OUT WHAT

01:12:34.717 --> 01:12:36.518
IS WORKING AND CONTINUE THAT AND

01:12:36.585 --> 01:12:38.253
NOT JUST MAKE DECISIONS BECAUSE

01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:39.788
IT SOUNDS LIKE THEBEST IDEA SO

01:12:39.855 --> 01:12:41.623
I WOULD -- JUST TO HAVE TO GET

01:12:41.690 --> 01:12:43.325
SOME OF THAT INFORMATION AND TRY

01:12:43.392 --> 01:12:44.326
TO MAKE A DECISION AND IF THAT

01:12:44.393 --> 01:12:45.494
IS A YOUTH POPULATION THAT IS

01:12:45.561 --> 01:12:46.762
BEING BETTER SERVED IN THOSE

01:12:46.829 --> 01:12:49.298
PLACES THEN WE WE CATER THE BILL

01:12:49.364 --> 01:12:51.533
TO ENSURE THOSE PEOPLE GET THE

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:51.967
TREATMENT THEY NEED.

01:12:52.034 --> 01:12:54.737
THANK YOU.

01:12:54.803 --> 01:12:56.071
THANK YOU MISTER MARKET OF THANK

01:12:56.138 --> 01:12:57.239

SUPPORTING THIS BILL AS WELL I

01:12:59.608 --> 01:13:01.243
DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW THAT I

01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:02.711
THINK THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL IS

01:13:02.778 --> 01:13:04.813
TRYING TO DISMANTLE D. J. J..

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:07.282
BUT IF THAT WERE THE CASE I

01:13:07.349 --> 01:13:09.518
WOULD BE OKAY WITH THAT -- TOO I

01:13:09.585 --> 01:13:11.587
THINK THAT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING

01:13:11.653 --> 01:13:13.555
ABOUT FACILITIES THAT ARE NOT

01:13:13.622 --> 01:13:15.257
FULL.

01:13:15.324 --> 01:13:17.760
WHAT YOU END UP WHAT ENDS UP

01:13:17.826 --> 01:13:19.094
HAPPENING IS?

01:13:19.161 --> 01:13:21.029
YOU EITHER HAVE THE STATE

01:13:21.096 --> 01:13:24.800
TURNING INTO A PROPERTY MANAGER --

01:13:24.867 --> 01:13:27.936
OPERATING FACILITIES OR YOU HAVE

01:13:28.003 --> 01:13:30.205
A STATE LOOKING TO FILL ITS

01:13:30.272 --> 01:13:31.406
VACANCY RATE.

01:13:31.473 --> 01:13:32.908
AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT INTERESTED

01:13:32.975 --> 01:13:34.243
IN HAVING THE PENDULUM SWING

01:13:34.309 --> 01:13:36.612
BACK SO THAT WE CAN FIND WAYS TO

01:13:36.678 --> 01:13:38.881
FILL THOSE SLOTS BECAUSE WE WANT

01:13:38.947 --> 01:13:40.215
TO BE ABLE TO PROVE.

01:13:40.282 --> 01:13:41.850
THAT THIS IS A SYSTEM THAT WE

01:13:41.917 --> 01:13:43.318
NEED TO KEEP IN PLACE.

01:13:43.385 --> 01:13:45.821
WE MAY NOT HAVE THE ANSWERS TO

01:13:45.888 --> 01:13:47.456
EVERY QUESTION.

01:13:47.523 --> 01:13:49.691
AND ANSWERS THAT ARE PERFECT BUT

01:13:49.758 --> 01:13:51.827
THAT'S CALLED LIFE AND IT'S ALSO

01:13:51.894 --> 01:13:53.529
CALLED EVOLUTION AND I THINK

01:13:53.595 --> 01:13:54.897
WHAT THIS BILL IS SAYING IS THAT

01:13:54.963 --> 01:13:57.132
WE HAVE DONE THIS FOR A TIME.

01:13:57.199 --> 01:13:58.467
AND IT'S PROVEN NOT TO BE

01:13:58.534 --> 01:14:01.570
EFFECTIVE I ALSO THINK.

01:14:01.637 --> 01:14:04.473
THAT HAVING USED THESE ARE YOUTH

01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:05.707
PRISONS ESSENTIALLY.

01:14:05.774 --> 01:14:07.709
ISOLATED FROM THEIR COMMUNITY

01:14:07.776 --> 01:14:09.711
FROM THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS.

01:14:09.778 --> 01:14:11.680
IS NOT HELPFUL MANY OF US ARE

01:14:11.747 --> 01:14:13.182
PARENTS AND WE'RE CERTAINLY NOT

01:14:13.248 --> 01:14:14.416
INTERESTED IN SENDING OUR KIDS

01:14:14.483 --> 01:14:16.251
VERY LONG DISTANCES FOR VERY

01:14:16.318 --> 01:14:18.187
LONG PERIODS OF TIME WITHOUT ANY

01:14:18.253 --> 01:14:20.556
HELP OR WITHOUT ANY --

01:14:20.622 --> 01:14:23.192
VISITATION FROM US OUR COUNCIL.

01:14:23.258 --> 01:14:24.660
AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE

01:14:24.726 --> 01:14:26.662
A NUMBER.

01:14:26.728 --> 01:14:28.163
OF ROBUST.

01:14:28.230 --> 01:14:30.365
EFFECTIVE COMMUNITY BASED

01:14:30.432 --> 01:14:32.835
ORGANIZATIONS IN OUR COMMUNITIES

01:14:32.901 --> 01:14:34.636
ACROSS THE STATE WHO CAN

01:14:34.703 --> 01:14:36.738
PROBABLY HANDLE THE SPECIALIZED

01:14:36.805 --> 01:14:38.407
NEEDS THAT A NUMBER OF THESE

01:14:38.473 --> 01:14:39.408
YOUTH MEET.

01:14:39.474 --> 01:14:41.510
BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

01:14:41.577 --> 01:14:43.445
WE GO BACK TO THE COMMUNITIES.

01:14:43.512 --> 01:14:45.314
WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE FROM AND

01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:47.883
SAY HOW DO WE INTEGRATE OF THOSE

01:14:47.950 --> 01:14:50.686
SERVICES AND THOSE MENTORS INTO

01:14:50.752 --> 01:14:52.120
THE LIVES OF THESE YOUNG FOLKS

01:14:52.187 --> 01:14:54.423
WHILE WE'RE HOPING THAT THEY

01:14:54.489 --> 01:14:55.724
REHABILITATE?

01:14:55.791 --> 01:14:57.259
RATHER THAN AND FIND WAYS TO

01:14:57.326 --> 01:15:00.762
SHIFT THEM CONTINUALLY INTO A

01:15:00.829 --> 01:15:02.798
STATE SYSTEM.

01:15:02.865 --> 01:15:04.166
THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENT TO

01:15:04.233 --> 01:15:06.168
THE QUESTION.

01:15:06.235 --> 01:15:07.302
YOU MAY CLOSE SENATE BILL

01:15:07.369 --> 01:15:08.770
SHARMAN WE HAVE WE HAVE FOUR

01:15:08.837 --> 01:15:12.007
FACILITIES -- THE USED TO HANG

01:15:12.074 --> 01:15:13.609
OUT HANDLE UP TO TEN THOUSAND

01:15:13.675 --> 01:15:14.276
PEOPLE.

01:15:14.343 --> 01:15:16.812
OF NOW THERE ARE.

01:15:16.879 --> 01:15:19.181
SEVEN HUNDRED AND WE'RE RUNNING

01:15:19.248 --> 01:15:21.049
THE FOR FACILITIES AS YOU SAID

01:15:21.116 --> 01:15:22.351
AS A PROPERTY MANAGEMENT.

01:15:22.417 --> 01:15:23.952
AND AND THE SYSTEM'S GOING TO

01:15:24.019 --> 01:15:25.420
CHANGE WHEN IT GOES OVER TO THE

01:15:25.487 --> 01:15:26.688
OTHER DEPARTMENT.

01:15:26.755 --> 01:15:30.359
SO -- I THINK I THINK -- WE ALL

01:15:30.425 --> 01:15:32.160
KNOW.

01:15:32.227 --> 01:15:33.262
IN CRIMINAL JUST STARTING

01:15:33.328 --> 01:15:34.863
CRIMINAL JUSTICE.

01:15:34.930 --> 01:15:37.065
THAT BRINGING KIDS CLOSER TO

01:15:37.132 --> 01:15:39.601
THEIR HOME TO THOSE RESOURCES.

01:15:39.668 --> 01:15:40.936
THERE NEAR WHERE THEY LIVE HERE

01:15:41.003 --> 01:15:42.104
FAMILIES.

01:15:42.170 --> 01:15:46.441
IS IS THE PROPER WAY. TO HANDLE

01:15:46.508 --> 01:15:48.644
KIDS THAT HAVE COMMITTED CRIMES

01:15:48.710 --> 01:15:50.145
AND IF WE EVER HOPE TO

01:15:50.212 --> 01:15:51.413
REHABILITATE THEM.

01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:53.315
AND PREVENT THE RICH RECIDIVISM

01:15:53.382 --> 01:15:54.883
WE HAVE TO DO THAT.

01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:56.685
AND THAT'S WHY I INTRODUCED THIS

01:15:56.752 --> 01:15:59.454
BILL AND I REGION I VOTE.

01:15:59.521 --> 01:16:00.722
THANK YOU AND I'M.

01:16:00.789 --> 01:16:01.657
GOING TO SUPPORT IS I THINK PART

01:16:01.723 --> 01:16:03.258
OF PROBLEM IS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT

01:16:03.325 --> 01:16:05.894
THAT NEW IT IS -- I'M GOING TO

01:16:05.961 --> 01:16:09.131
NORWAY. TO LOOK AT HOW THEY

01:16:09.197 --> 01:16:09.698
IMPRISON.

01:16:09.765 --> 01:16:11.833
PEOPLE THERE.

01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:13.268
THEY'RE NOT GRAY THEY'RE NOT

01:16:13.335 --> 01:16:16.471
CEMENT THE NOT BARS -- LOT OF

01:16:16.538 --> 01:16:18.073
LOOK LIKE DORMS AND THEY HAVE A

01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:22.644
HUGE -- RATE WHERE PEOPLE DO NOT

01:16:22.711 --> 01:16:24.947
RECEIVE A THEY TREAT THEIR THEIR

01:16:25.013 --> 01:16:26.515
INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS MUCH

01:16:26.581 --> 01:16:27.716
DIFFERENT.

01:16:27.783 --> 01:16:29.184
I THINK THE WAY WE START IS TO

01:16:29.251 --> 01:16:30.719
START WITH OUR YOUNG PEOPLE.

01:16:30.786 --> 01:16:32.654
THE THE WAY WE'RE GOING TO

01:16:32.721 --> 01:16:34.222
HANDLE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM

01:16:34.289 --> 01:16:35.457
NOT ALREADY CHANGED THE

01:16:35.524 --> 01:16:37.893
FACILITIES THE WAY THEY LOOK.

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:39.661
BUT I WANT THIS I'VE NEVER BEEN

01:16:39.728 --> 01:16:41.196
A BIG FAN AND I PROBABLY GET

01:16:41.263 --> 01:16:43.031
SOME GROUNDS OF OF EVIDENCE

01:16:43.098 --> 01:16:45.434
BASED I'VE BEEN A FAN OF RETURN

01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:47.035
ON INVESTMENT.

01:16:47.102 --> 01:16:48.937
WHICH MEANS YOU PROVE THAT

01:16:49.004 --> 01:16:50.772
YOU'RE PROGRAMS WORK AND YOU

01:16:50.839 --> 01:16:54.543
PROVE THAT YOU GET MONEY BACK.

01:16:54.609 --> 01:16:55.777
TO THE STATE AND MAKE IT

01:16:55.844 --> 01:16:57.179
PROFITABLE.

01:16:57.245 --> 01:16:58.413
YOU MAKE IT SO THAT IT MAKES

01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:00.048
SENSE TO MAKE IT SO THAT PEOPLE

01:17:00.115 --> 01:17:02.851
GET BACK HOME. TO THEIR FAMILIES

01:17:02.918 --> 01:17:04.219
AND THEIR FRIENDS AND THEIR

01:17:04.286 --> 01:17:06.221
SCHOOLS AND THEY DON'T STAY

01:17:06.288 --> 01:17:07.990
WITHIN THAT PRISON INDUSTRIAL

01:17:08.056 --> 01:17:08.790
SYSTEM.

01:17:08.857 --> 01:17:10.492
AND JUST STAY IN IT FOREVER AND

01:17:10.559 --> 01:17:12.494
THAT'S WHAT I CALL RETURN ON

01:17:12.561 --> 01:17:13.562
INVESTMENT.

01:17:13.628 --> 01:17:16.965
EVIDENCE BASE IS I CAN PROVE IT.

01:17:17.032 --> 01:17:19.601
BUT I DON'T WANT TO AUDIT.

01:17:19.668 --> 01:17:21.236
RETURN ON INVESTMENT YOU HAVE TO

01:17:21.303 --> 01:17:22.904
AUDIT AND WHEN IT DOESN'T WORK

01:17:22.971 --> 01:17:24.840
YOU NEED TO GET RID OF IT.

01:17:24.906 --> 01:17:26.675
WHEN IT DOES WORK YOU NEED TO

01:17:26.742 --> 01:17:28.143
GET MORE MONEY TO IT AND USUALLY

01:17:28.210 --> 01:17:30.112
EXPANDED AND YOU MAKE MAKE SURE

01:17:30.178 --> 01:17:31.947
IT IS ROBUST AND SO I THINK

01:17:32.014 --> 01:17:33.215
THAT'S PART A PROBLEM WHAT

01:17:33.281 --> 01:17:34.182

01:17:34.249 --> 01:17:35.350

01:20:56.685 --> 01:20:58.153
SMALL NUMBER OF STORES.

CONTINUE TO HAVE SERIOUS

01:24:34.335 --> 01:24:36.171
CONCERNS WITH THE BILL -- THIS

01:24:36.237 --> 01:24:38.339
DOES PROVIDE MORE THAN ONE WAY

01:24:38.406 --> 01:24:39.541
TO COMPLY.

01:24:39.607 --> 01:24:42.644
BUT AGAIN THE SECURITY MEASURES

ALREADY IN PLACE THIS IS

01:24:49.250 --> 01:24:51.853
CUMBERSOME AND AND NOT WORKABLE.

01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:53.755
FOR EXAMPLE BASS PRO SHOP DOES

01:24:53.822 --> 01:24:55.757
OPPOSE THIS BILL AND THEY'VE

01:24:55.824 --> 01:24:57.892
MENTIONED FOR EXAMPLE THAT THEIR

THEIR STORE IS ON FROM FLOOR

01:24:59.394 --> 01:25:01.496
LEVEL AND LIKE BALLARD'S DON'T

01:25:01.563 --> 01:25:03.264
WORK SO MANY OF THE OPTIONS

01:25:03.331 --> 01:25:04.833
OFFERED DON'T WORK FOR THEM.

01:25:04.899 --> 01:25:06.401
BUT THEY HAVE OTHER SECURITY

01:25:06.468 --> 01:25:07.802
MEASURES IN PLACE.

01:25:07.869 --> 01:25:09.003
THEY'RE ALSO LOCAL ON

01:25:09.070 --> 01:25:10.772
JURISDICTIONS THAT LIMIT VARIOUS

01:25:10.839 --> 01:25:12.140
CHANGES.

01:25:12.207 --> 01:25:13.641
THAT ARE BEING RECOMMENDED AS

01:25:13.708 --> 01:25:15.176
THE OPTIONS IN THE BILL DUE TO

01:25:15.243 --> 01:25:16.711
LOCAL ORDINANCES SUCH AS

01:25:16.778 --> 01:25:18.580
BALLARD'S DEPENDING ON WHERE THE

01:25:18.646 --> 01:25:20.114
STORE IS LOCATED.

01:25:20.181 --> 01:25:21.783
THIS BILL WOULD CREATE A DAHLE

01:25:21.850 --> 01:25:23.551
REQUIREMENT I UNDERSTAND WHAT --

01:25:23.618 --> 01:25:25.186
CENTERVILLE SAYING ABOUT THE

01:25:25.253 --> 01:25:27.388
LOCAL CONTROL ISSUE HOWEVER IF

01:25:27.455 --> 01:25:28.823
YOU HAVE THE STATE.

01:25:28.890 --> 01:25:30.825
OF LAW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO PUT

01:25:30.892 --> 01:25:33.394
INTO EFFECT HERE IN CONFLICT

01:25:33.461 --> 01:25:35.163
WITH THE LOCAL REGULATION -- THE

01:25:35.230 --> 01:25:37.699
RETAILER NEEDS A CLEAR PATHWAY

01:25:37.765 --> 01:25:39.334
TO KNOW HOW TO COMPLY BECAUSE

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:40.468
THEY TECHNICALLY BE OUT OF

01:25:40.535 --> 01:25:44.305
COMPLIANCE WITH ONE OF THE

01:25:44.372 --> 01:25:45.707
OTHERS -- WITH THE BILL ONLY

01:25:45.773 --> 01:25:46.641
PROVIDES A LICENSEE AN EXCEPTION

01:25:46.708 --> 01:25:49.410

01:25:49.477 --> 01:25:51.613
THEY SEEK ONE IT ISN'T A SHALL

01:25:51.679 --> 01:25:53.848
IT'S A MAY AND THEY SHOULD BE

01:25:53.915 --> 01:25:55.817
GIVEN THAT EXEMPTION IF THEY

01:25:55.884 --> 01:25:58.019
HAVE NO WAY TO COMPLY -- THIS

01:25:58.086 --> 01:25:59.187
GREATLY INCREASES THE COST OF

01:25:59.254 --> 01:26:00.188
DOING BUSINESS IN THE STATE

01:26:00.255 --> 01:26:01.856
WITHOUT ANY MAJOR BENEFITS TO

01:26:01.923 --> 01:26:03.091
PUBLIC SAFETY.

01:26:03.157 --> 01:26:04.792
THESE ARE VALUABLE PRODUCTS TO

01:26:04.859 --> 01:26:05.860
THE BUSINESS AND THEY WOULD

01:26:05.927 --> 01:26:07.762
INCUR INSURANCE A PRODUCT LOSSES

01:26:07.829 --> 01:26:09.030
IF THEY HAVE STEPS.

01:26:09.097 --> 01:26:10.331
THEY HAVE A STAKE IN PROTECTING

01:26:10.398 --> 01:26:11.766
THEIR PROPERTY AND THEY COULD

01:26:11.833 --> 01:26:13.735
LOSE THEIR LICENSE -- UNDER

01:26:13.801 --> 01:26:15.270
THESE CONDITIONS WHILE DATA WAS

FOUR POINT 3% VIOLENT CRIME

01:26:26.247 --> 01:26:27.949
RATES WHICH WOULD INCLUDE THE

SMASHING GRABS.

01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:30.618
LASTLY THE INDUSTRY HAS AN

01:26:30.685 --> 01:26:32.587
AGGRESSIVE PROGRAM FOR RETAILERS

01:26:32.654 --> 01:26:34.556

WANTED TO ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE.

01:33:23.764 --> 01:33:26.300
BY SENATOR HILL THAT ONE GUN IS

01:33:26.367 --> 01:33:28.169
TOO MANY HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR

01:33:28.235 --> 01:33:28.736
HUNDRED EIGHTY WHATEVER THE

01:33:28.803 --> 01:33:30.137
NUMBER IS IT TAKES ONE TO TAKE A

01:33:30.204 --> 01:33:31.505
LIFE AND SO.

01:33:31.572 --> 01:33:32.540
YOU KNOW.

01:33:32.606 --> 01:33:33.908
AS I READ THE BILL THERE ARE A

01:33:33.975 --> 01:33:35.409
LOT OF OPTIONS AS TO HOW TO

01:33:35.476 --> 01:33:36.744
SECURE IT BUT IF YOU HAVE A CLUE

01:33:36.811 --> 01:33:38.145
THEIR OPTIONS THAT ARE WORKING

01:33:38.212 --> 01:33:39.547
BECAUSE AGAIN THERE.

01:33:39.613 --> 01:33:40.848
ABOUT A MILLION GUNS YOU SAID

01:33:40.915 --> 01:33:42.350
SOLD A YEAR THREE MILLION OVER

01:33:42.416 --> 01:33:44.885
THREE MILLION -- A YEAR AND A

01:33:44.952 --> 01:33:45.987
LOT MORE THE MAJORITY DOES NOT

01:33:46.053 --> 01:33:46.787
BEING SOLD SO THERE ARE OTHER

01:33:46.854 --> 01:33:47.855
OPTIONS THAT ARE WORKING I'M

01:33:47.922 --> 01:33:49.757
SURE SENATOR HILL WILL BE OPEN

01:33:49.824 --> 01:33:50.624
TO OTHER OPTIONS THAT ARE

01:33:50.691 --> 01:33:51.292
EFFECTIVE.

01:33:51.359 --> 01:33:52.626
BUT THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT

01:33:52.693 --> 01:33:53.728
HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR GUNS EVEN

01:33:53.794 --> 01:33:55.129
IF WE ASSUME THE LOW END IS TOO

01:33:55.196 --> 01:33:55.663
MANY.

01:33:55.730 --> 01:33:56.897
AND THAT WE NEED TO DO

01:33:56.964 --> 01:33:58.165
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO KEEP THE

01:33:58.232 --> 01:33:59.667
CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA SAFE AND

01:33:59.734 --> 01:34:00.968
THAT MEANS ENSURING THAT THESE

01:34:01.035 --> 01:34:02.303
FIREARMS AREN'T.

01:34:02.370 --> 01:34:04.905
STOLEN AND USED IN THE

01:34:04.972 --> 01:34:05.906
COMMISSION OF A CRIME SO

HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS WHAT

01:34:14.382 --> 01:34:15.883
ARE THE PENALTIES FOR NON

01:34:15.950 --> 01:34:18.285
COMPLIANCE.

01:34:18.352 --> 01:34:27.962
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION -- I

01:34:28.029 --> 01:34:30.998
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ADDRESS.

01:34:31.065 --> 01:34:33.801
THEY LOSE THEIR PROBABLY FOR THE

01:34:33.868 --> 01:34:36.303
FEET. THREE EIGHT THE LICENSE IS

01:34:36.370 --> 01:34:38.005
SUBJECT TO FORFEITURE.

01:34:38.072 --> 01:34:38.639
I DON'T KNOW IF IT GOES TO THE

01:34:38.706 --> 01:34:42.877
LICENSE FORFEITURE OF THE NOT --

01:34:42.943 --> 01:34:43.411
I DIDN'T WITH JOHN CAN WE

01:34:43.477 --> 01:34:44.645
RESPOND.

01:34:44.712 --> 01:34:46.047
IF THE IF YOU TYPICALLY BE

01:34:46.113 --> 01:34:47.181
VIOLATE ANY OF THE LAWS

01:34:47.248 --> 01:34:48.783
GOVERNING THE OPERATION OF THE

01:34:48.849 --> 01:34:50.885
BUSINESS IT'S THE LOSS OF YOUR

01:34:50.951 --> 01:34:53.220
LICENSE AND BUSINESS.

01:34:53.287 --> 01:34:55.322
SO CAN YOU SAY THAT AGAIN.

01:34:55.389 --> 01:34:57.024
TYPICALLY IF YOU'RE INVOLVED IN

01:34:57.091 --> 01:34:58.893
ANY VIOLATIONS OF THE LAWS

01:34:58.959 --> 01:34:59.860
GOVERNED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:34:59.927 --> 01:35:01.729
JUSTICE WITH THE OPERATION OF

01:35:01.796 --> 01:35:03.297
YOUR GUN DEALERSHIP.

01:35:03.364 --> 01:35:04.799
IT'S THE LOSS OF YOUR LICENSE

01:35:04.865 --> 01:35:05.966
AND YOUR ABILITY TO SELL

01:35:06.033 --> 01:35:08.135
FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION.

01:35:08.202 --> 01:35:10.438
OKAY I DIDN'T SEE THAT LANGUAGE

01:35:10.504 --> 01:35:12.573
IN HERE WHICH WAS WHY I WAS

01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:14.241
ASKING FOR CLARIFICATION.

01:35:14.308 --> 01:35:17.711
SO -- THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE

01:35:17.778 --> 01:35:20.781
IS IF YOU COULD JUST SORT OF RE

01:35:20.848 --> 01:35:25.219
CLARIFY FOR ME -- THE DEFINITION

01:35:25.286 --> 01:35:28.489
OF STORE A RETAILER OF LICENSE

01:35:28.556 --> 01:35:29.790
DEALER AND THE REASON WHY I

01:35:29.857 --> 01:35:31.125
ASKED THAT QUESTION IS BECAUSE

01:35:31.192 --> 01:35:33.060
IN AN ADJACENT DISTRICT JUST A

01:35:33.127 --> 01:35:36.197
MONTH AGO -- IN BEL AIR THERE

01:35:36.263 --> 01:35:38.833
WAS A GENTLEMAN SOMEONE WHO WAS

01:35:38.899 --> 01:35:39.767
I GUESS.

01:35:39.834 --> 01:35:40.734
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE MAN WAS

01:35:40.801 --> 01:35:42.236
DOING HE HAD OVER A THOUSAND

01:35:42.303 --> 01:35:44.371
GUNS.

01:35:44.438 --> 01:35:46.273
IN THIS HOME IN BEL AIR.

01:35:46.340 --> 01:35:50.578
NOT A SQUEAK OR P..

01:35:50.644 --> 01:35:53.114
ABOUT THE INJUSTICE A BE NOT

01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:55.216
CHARGED.

01:35:55.282 --> 01:35:57.184
OKAY ON BAIL FOR FIVE THOUSAND

01:35:57.251 --> 01:35:59.086
DOLLARS.

01:35:59.153 --> 01:36:00.488
I COULD GET INTO A WHOLE OTHER

01:36:00.554 --> 01:36:02.456
CONVERSATION ABOUT YOU KNOW THE

01:36:02.523 --> 01:36:04.091
BIAS.

01:36:04.158 --> 01:36:05.893
IN THAT BUT I'M NOT GONNA SAVE

01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:08.062
THAT FOR ANOTHER BILL -- BUT I

01:36:08.129 --> 01:36:09.530
JUST WOULD LIKE TO GET SOME

01:36:09.597 --> 01:36:12.867
CLARIFICATION ABOUT YOU KNOW WHO.

01:36:12.933 --> 01:36:14.568
WOULD REALLY BE IMPACTED IN

01:36:14.635 --> 01:36:16.036
TERMS OF BEING A LICENSED DEALER

01:36:16.103 --> 01:36:17.538
BECAUSE SOME WOULD ARGUE THAT HE

01:36:17.605 --> 01:36:19.340
WAS NOT AND THEN I WOULD

01:36:19.406 --> 01:36:21.342
CERTAINLY NOT WANT THAT PERSON.

01:36:21.408 --> 01:36:23.677
TO BE EXEMPT FROM THIS WHICH WAS

01:36:23.744 --> 01:36:25.079
MY PREVIOUS QUESTION ABOUT NON

01:36:25.146 --> 01:36:26.981
COMPLIANCE AND PENALTIES BECAUSE

01:36:27.047 --> 01:36:29.450
THAT PERSON SHOULD BE CHARGED

01:36:29.517 --> 01:36:31.252
AND SHOULD BE GIVEN PENALTIES

01:36:31.318 --> 01:36:34.388
AND THAT HASN'T HAPPENED.

01:36:34.455 --> 01:36:34.588
WHAT?

01:36:34.655 --> 01:36:36.223
IF THIS THIS WOULD APPLY ONLY TO

01:36:36.290 --> 01:36:37.358
RETAIL DEAL RETAIL.

01:36:37.424 --> 01:36:39.593
DEALERS AND THOSE WHO SELL AT

01:36:39.660 --> 01:36:42.096
RETAIL FIREARMS AND IN THE

01:36:42.163 --> 01:36:42.830
GETTING BACK TO YOUR OTHER

01:36:42.897 --> 01:36:43.764
QUESTION JUST.

01:36:43.831 --> 01:36:45.499
TO THIS DOES NOT ADD ANY

01:36:45.566 --> 01:36:46.800
ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.

01:36:46.867 --> 01:36:47.835
IN TERMS OF THIS THIS IS

01:36:47.902 --> 01:36:50.171
CONSISTENT WITH THE EXISTING LAW

01:36:50.237 --> 01:36:52.840
AND IS CORRECTED IN A FIVE APPLY

01:36:52.907 --> 01:36:53.541
TO WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:36:53.607 --> 01:36:55.176
JUSTICE WE DON'T EVEN KNOW HE'S

01:36:55.242 --> 01:36:58.579
SELLING GUNS OUT OF THE HOME

01:36:58.646 --> 01:37:00.848
HE'S NOT.

01:37:00.915 --> 01:37:03.184
YES AS WAS THE NFL.

01:37:03.250 --> 01:37:04.818
I YOU THERE'S NO NO LIMIT ON THE

01:37:04.885 --> 01:37:05.986
NUMBER OF GUNS THE INDIVIDUAL

01:37:06.053 --> 01:37:07.521
CAN ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT THERE

01:37:07.588 --> 01:37:09.690
ARE SAFE STORAGE LAWS IRAQ --

01:37:09.757 --> 01:37:12.893
BUT IF HE WAS WASN'T AN FFL -- I

01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:14.728
DON'T THINK HE WAS BREAKING THE

01:37:14.795 --> 01:37:16.297
LAW IN TERMS OF HAVING A LOT OF

01:37:16.363 --> 01:37:18.132
POSSESSING LOVE GUNS NOW HOW WE

01:37:18.199 --> 01:37:20.000
GOT THE GUNS HE PROBABLY WAS AND

01:37:20.067 --> 01:37:23.170
THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE BUT SOMEONE

01:37:23.237 --> 01:37:25.506
POSSESSING ON THANK YOU I WASN'T

01:37:25.573 --> 01:37:27.074

01:37:27.374 --> 01:37:30.778
AT RETAIL.

01:37:30.844 --> 01:37:39.820
A TIME TO LEAVE.

01:37:39.887 --> 01:37:40.087
THE DEEP.

01:37:40.154 --> 01:37:42.923
TYLER.

01:37:42.990 --> 01:37:44.158
HE WAS CHAIRMAN AYE AYES HAVE A

01:37:44.225 --> 01:37:46.293
GUN.

01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:47.795
I GUESS A A AND AND OBSERVATION

01:37:47.861 --> 01:37:48.562
IN A QUESTIONS SOME.

01:37:48.629 --> 01:37:50.497
OF THE THE BILL BEFORE US IS

01:37:50.564 --> 01:37:52.633
SEEKING -- TO LIMIT GUN THAT

01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:56.770
GUNS THAT CAN BE STOLEN -- FOR

01:37:56.837 --> 01:37:58.672
ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES.

01:37:58.739 --> 01:38:01.642
DO WE KNOW WHAT A JOB.

01:38:01.709 --> 01:38:02.876
THEN I HEARD DO YOU KNOW IF

01:38:02.943 --> 01:38:05.179
THERE'S ANY ANYTHING -- IN OUR

01:38:05.246 --> 01:38:08.949
PENAL CODE THAT.

01:38:09.016 --> 01:38:12.086
PUNISH THOSE THAT ACTUALLY GO TO

01:38:12.152 --> 01:38:15.856
EIGHTY A GUN STORE AN STEAL GUNS.

01:38:15.923 --> 01:38:16.924
IS THERE SOMETHING IN THE PEORIA

01:38:16.991 --> 01:38:18.492
IT WITHOUT ITS OWN IN THE IN THE

01:38:18.559 --> 01:38:20.027

BURGLARY OR SOMETHING THAT WOULD

01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:27.835
BE.

01:38:27.901 --> 01:38:29.970
OF LAWS AGAINST THAT YES.

01:38:30.037 --> 01:38:33.741
HAVE WE THOUGHT ABOUT --

01:38:33.807 --> 01:38:37.411
DISCOURAGING.

01:38:37.478 --> 01:38:38.579
PEOPLE FROM STEALING GUNS MORE

01:38:38.646 --> 01:38:41.615

THREAT FOR THE I DON'T KNOW THAT

01:38:43.584 --> 01:38:46.387

I'M I'M TRYING TO THINK OF IT

01:38:47.655 --> 01:38:48.789

OWNER AND CRIMINALS I DON'T

01:39:01.702 --> 01:39:03.003
THINK THAT IF IF THAT'S A

01:39:03.070 --> 01:39:04.171
QUESTION HAVE BEEN ANSWERED I

01:39:04.238 --> 01:39:04.638
DON'T THINK IT'S THE

01:39:04.705 --> 01:39:06.373
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE THE GUN

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:09.643

PUNISHMENT SOMEONE SHOULD GET

BUT IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF

01:39:12.579 --> 01:39:13.614
A GUN STORE OWNER TO MAKE SURE

01:39:13.681 --> 01:39:15.082

01:40:25.919 --> 01:40:27.921
PUNISHMENT FOR STEALING FIREARMS

01:40:27.988 --> 01:40:30.023

01:40:30.090 --> 01:40:32.025

YES MISS WICKS.

01:40:37.097 --> 01:40:39.366
SO -- THE OPPOSITION I THINK

01:40:39.433 --> 01:40:40.834
STATED GOING BACK TO THE NUMBERS

01:40:40.901 --> 01:40:44.405
FOREIGN SEVENTY NINE IN ONE YEAR

01:40:44.471 --> 01:40:45.005
ONE SEVENTY FOUR AND ONE YEAR

01:40:45.072 --> 01:40:46.106
AND THEN.

01:40:46.173 --> 01:40:47.274
ONE FORTY FOUR SO THAT'S IF I DO

01:40:47.341 --> 01:40:50.811
MY MATH RIGHT THAT'S SEVEN

01:40:50.878 --> 01:40:51.445
HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN GUNS STONE

TO BRAG ABOUT.

01:40:59.586 --> 01:41:00.154

01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:04.124
OF AND IN MY OPINION THAT'S NINE

01:41:04.191 --> 01:41:04.758
SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN GUNS

01:41:04.825 --> 01:41:05.726

GOOD MORNING LUCIA MUCH CHARM

02:02:49.528 --> 02:02:50.629
BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA

02:02:50.696 --> 02:02:52.131
ASSOCIATION OF CRIME LAB

02:02:52.198 --> 02:02:53.499
DIRECTORS AND SUPPORT.

02:02:53.566 --> 02:02:55.768
THANK YOU.

02:02:55.835 --> 02:03:02.475
ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION.

CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR

CRIMINAL JUSTICE -- WERE IN

02:03:06.345 --> 02:03:08.814
OPPOSITION ON THE BILL AND WE

02:03:08.881 --> 02:03:09.381
WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THE

02:03:09.448 --> 02:03:10.850
CALIFORNIA HAS NOT ESTABLISHED

02:03:10.916 --> 02:03:12.184
TESTING LEVELS THAT ESTABLISH

02:03:12.251 --> 02:03:13.486
IMPAIRMENT FOR SOME OF THESE

02:03:13.552 --> 02:03:15.121
DRUGS THAT WOULD BE COVERED.

02:03:15.187 --> 02:03:17.156
SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU COULD HAVE A

02:03:17.223 --> 02:03:18.858
DRUG IN YOUR SYSTEM BUT IT YOU

02:03:18.924 --> 02:03:19.792
COULD HAVE.

02:03:19.859 --> 02:03:21.660
ACTUALLY HAD THE DRUG A FEW DAYS

02:03:21.727 --> 02:03:23.395
BEFORE A FEW WEEKS BEFORE BUT

02:03:23.462 --> 02:03:24.830
STILL TEST POSITIVE FOR IT.

02:03:24.897 --> 02:03:25.731
AND WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:03:25.798 --> 02:03:28.234
THAT WE HAVE -- PROPER DATA WHEN

02:03:28.300 --> 02:03:30.803
WE'RE GOING INTO THESE THINGS.

02:03:30.870 --> 02:03:33.439
THANK YOU VERY MUCH DO YOU.

02:03:33.506 --> 02:03:34.006
ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE

02:03:34.073 --> 02:03:36.408
MEMBERS.

02:03:36.475 --> 02:03:40.379
ROM THIS IS BAD SCIENCE.

02:03:40.446 --> 02:03:42.348
ALL RIGHT FIRST OF ALL.

02:03:42.414 --> 02:03:45.184
THIS IS BEEN DONE WELL IN EUROPE.

02:03:45.251 --> 02:03:47.286
BUT WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO FIRST IS

02:03:47.353 --> 02:03:49.255
DETERMINE.

02:03:49.321 --> 02:03:51.490
OF THOSE DRIVING.

02:03:51.557 --> 02:03:52.958
WHAT PERCENTAGE?

02:03:53.025 --> 02:03:55.628
HAVE FOR EXAMPLE AMPHETAMINES.

02:03:55.694 --> 02:03:57.429
YOU MAY FIND.

02:03:57.496 --> 02:03:59.131
THAT.

02:03:59.198 --> 02:03:59.698
AND THIS WAS FOUND THAT IN

02:03:59.765 --> 02:04:00.633
EUROPE.

02:04:00.699 --> 02:04:02.601
THERE'S ALMOST A 100% RISK OF AN

02:04:02.668 --> 02:04:05.004
ACCIDENT IF YOU HAVEN'T FEATHER

02:04:05.070 --> 02:04:07.640
MEANS THEY DO THIS BY SAMPLING

02:04:07.706 --> 02:04:09.375
THE DRIVER POPULATION.

02:04:09.441 --> 02:04:10.709
AND THEN SAMPLING THE PEOPLE

02:04:10.776 --> 02:04:12.511
INVOLVED IN ACCIDENTS AND NOT

02:04:12.578 --> 02:04:15.114
JUST THOSE WHO HAPPEN TO DIE

02:04:15.181 --> 02:04:15.414
[inaudible]

02:04:15.481 --> 02:04:17.082
FURTHER.

02:04:17.149 --> 02:04:18.651
IT'S VERY CLEAR TO ME YOU'RE

02:04:18.717 --> 02:04:20.152
GOING AFTER.

02:04:20.219 --> 02:04:21.487
MARIJUANA IN PARTICULAR

02:04:21.554 --> 02:04:23.322
MARIJUANA CAN BE IN THE SYSTEM

02:04:23.389 --> 02:04:25.257
FOR DAYS AFTER YOU SMOKE IT

02:04:25.324 --> 02:04:26.358
DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU HAVE

02:04:26.425 --> 02:04:27.927
IMPAIRMENT.

02:04:27.993 --> 02:04:28.561
FURTHER.

02:04:28.627 --> 02:04:30.763
IT'S ALL MY UNDERSTANDING IS

02:04:30.830 --> 02:04:32.131
THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE FOUND

02:04:32.198 --> 02:04:34.800
WITH MARIJUANA -- OFTEN ALSO

02:04:34.867 --> 02:04:35.601
FOUND.

02:04:35.668 --> 02:04:36.235
WITH.

02:04:36.302 --> 02:04:40.005
OTHER DRUGS PARTICULARLY ALCOHOL.

02:04:40.072 --> 02:04:41.774
UNLESS YOU COULD SEPARATE ALL OF

02:04:41.841 --> 02:04:43.242
THIS WHAT YOU'VE GOT IS

02:04:43.309 --> 02:04:44.810
CORRELATION.

02:04:44.877 --> 02:04:47.580
BUT THAT'S NOT CAUSATION THIS IS.

02:04:47.646 --> 02:04:50.249
JUST A OPEN SEASON.

02:04:50.316 --> 02:04:52.384
ON MARIJUANA THIS IS AN OPEN

02:04:52.451 --> 02:04:55.821
SEASON ON DOING BAD SCIENCE I

02:04:55.888 --> 02:04:57.590
CANNOT SUPPORT THIS BILL I WILL

02:04:57.656 --> 02:04:59.992
BE VOTING NOW I'M SORRY THAT I'M

02:05:00.059 --> 02:05:02.862
A LITTLE BIT EXCITED ABOUT THIS.

02:05:02.928 --> 02:05:04.563
BUT I REALLY SEE THIS AS POOR

02:05:04.630 --> 02:05:06.866
SCIENCE.

02:05:06.932 --> 02:05:08.133
WHAT YOU REALLY NEED TO DO IS

02:05:08.200 --> 02:05:09.501
WHAT'S BEEN DONE IN EUROPE FIND

02:05:09.568 --> 02:05:11.437
OUT?

02:05:11.503 --> 02:05:13.839
WHAT THE DRIVING POPULATION HAS

02:05:13.906 --> 02:05:15.207
AND THEN WHAT THE PEOPLE

02:05:15.274 --> 02:05:16.976
INVOLVED IN ACCIDENTS HALF NOT

02:05:17.042 --> 02:05:18.611
NECESSARILY THOSE?

02:05:18.677 --> 02:05:20.212
WHO HAVE DIED IN AN ACCIDENT WHO

02:05:20.279 --> 02:05:21.680
MAY WELL HAVE BEEN HIT BY

02:05:21.747 --> 02:05:23.816
SOMEBODY ELSE IT CETERA YOU'VE

02:05:23.883 --> 02:05:24.884
GOT TO LOOK AT THE PEOPLE AT

02:05:24.950 --> 02:05:25.317
FAULT?

02:05:25.384 --> 02:05:27.586
AGAIN THIS LOOKS TO ME LIKE AN

02:05:27.653 --> 02:05:30.723
ATTACK ON CANNABIS AND I CANNOT

02:05:30.789 --> 02:05:35.828
ACCEPT THIS THANK YOU.

ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF CORPUS CON

02:05:46.205 --> 02:05:47.573
MAN SO I SEE THE BILL IS

02:05:47.640 --> 02:05:49.475
SOMETHING IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF

02:05:49.541 --> 02:05:50.643
JUST GATHERING DATA.

02:05:50.709 --> 02:05:53.078
HI IF NOT FOR POLICY REASONS FOR

02:05:53.145 --> 02:05:55.281
EDUCATION I'M NOT SURE PEOPLE

02:05:55.347 --> 02:05:57.116
UNDERSTAND THAT THE COMBINATION

02:05:57.182 --> 02:05:59.985
OF AUG BEING -- CANNABIS USER

02:06:00.052 --> 02:06:02.521
AND THEN HAVING I'LL BURBAGE

02:06:02.588 --> 02:06:04.423
WELL SIR OPIOIDS BECAUSE OF PAIN

02:06:04.490 --> 02:06:06.458
WHATEVER OUR THAT COMBINATION IT

02:06:06.525 --> 02:06:07.893
CAN BE LETHAL WHEN THEY STEP

02:06:07.960 --> 02:06:09.295
BEHIND THE WHEEL IN MAINE THEY

02:06:09.361 --> 02:06:10.496
MAY NOT FEEL IT BECAUSE

02:06:10.562 --> 02:06:12.031
SOMETIMES THESE THINGS.

02:06:12.097 --> 02:06:13.999
DON'T HAVE A LASTING ABOUT SO

02:06:14.066 --> 02:06:15.668
WHEN I AM TO CALL THE

02:06:15.734 --> 02:06:17.303
OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE THE BILL

02:06:17.369 --> 02:06:19.872
THAT WAS MY THOUGHT -- BASED ON

02:06:19.939 --> 02:06:21.340
THE INFORMATION THAT I'VE.

02:06:21.407 --> 02:06:23.208

SESSIONS HERE ALL LOOKING AT THE

02:06:25.077 --> 02:06:27.112
OPIOID ISSUE SO I THOUGHT IT WAS

02:06:27.179 --> 02:06:28.948
A GOOD START I THINK THE THINGS

02:06:29.014 --> 02:06:29.882
THAT YOU HAVE MENTIONED

02:06:29.949 --> 02:06:31.550
CERTAINLY SHOULD NOT BE ARE

02:06:31.617 --> 02:06:33.552
ABANDONED IN TERMS OF THE COOL.

02:06:33.619 --> 02:06:35.220
THE COLLECTION OF DATA AND

02:06:35.287 --> 02:06:36.855
TAKING A LOOK AT WHETHER THERE'S

02:06:36.922 --> 02:06:39.458
CAUSATIVE -- CAUSE OF THE FACT

02:06:39.525 --> 02:06:41.961
OR IF IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS SO

02:06:42.027 --> 02:06:43.963
CONSEQUENTIAL ODDS SO THOSE ARE

02:06:44.029 --> 02:06:45.297
THE REASONS I THOUGHT IT WOULD

02:06:45.364 --> 02:06:46.765
BE GOOD TO MOVE FORWARD I KNOW

02:06:46.832 --> 02:06:48.500
LOSS VERY SIMILAR BILL IDEA TO

UNAIMOUS SUPPORT ON THE OTHER

02:06:57.609 --> 02:06:59.979

THE POINT SO.

02:20:36.528 --> 02:20:38.563
IF A PERSON WHO'S ABOUT TO BE

02:20:38.630 --> 02:20:41.166
ARRESTED FOR PROSTITUTION SAYS

02:20:41.232 --> 02:20:41.633

WOULD HAVE TO BE AFTER THE FACT

02:20:53.812 --> 02:20:55.046
THE YOU HAVE TO DETERMINE

02:20:55.113 --> 02:20:57.348

BY THE DEFENSE.

02:23:44.182 --> 02:23:46.217
IF THE IF THE COURT FINDS AFTER

SUCH A HEARING THAT THE OFFER OF

THOSE ARE SIGNIFICANT

02:23:57.095 --> 02:23:59.664
PROTECTIONS ALREADY IN LAW.

02:23:59.731 --> 02:24:01.733

LEGALIZE SEX WORK.

02:24:03.468 --> 02:24:05.169
IT SHOULD INTRODUCE LEGISLATION

02:25:11.269 --> 02:25:13.538
I THINK THIS AS SOON SO VERY ON

02:25:13.604 --> 02:25:16.207
NOTABLE THINGS TO CONSIDER WHAT

02:25:16.274 --> 02:25:17.241
ONE OF MY CONCERNS WAS BROUGHT

02:25:17.308 --> 02:25:18.943
FORWARD BY.

02:25:19.010 --> 02:25:20.178
THE OPPOSITION ON THE

02:25:23.281 --> 02:25:23.915
IT.

02:25:23.981 --> 02:25:25.783
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE

02:25:25.850 --> 02:25:27.885
ACTUALLY MAKE SURE THAT HAVE --

02:25:27.952 --> 02:25:30.288
SEX WORKERS ARE ENGAGED.

02:25:30.354 --> 02:25:32.790
AND WHATEVER THEY'RE DOING AND

02:25:32.857 --> 02:25:34.292
THAT THEY WITNESS AS A

02:25:34.358 --> 02:25:36.394
SIGNIFICANT CRIME THAT.

02:25:36.461 --> 02:25:38.062
THEY DO NEED TO BE ABSOLVED FROM.

02:25:38.129 --> 02:25:39.831
FROM THE RESPONSIBILITY IN PLACE

02:25:39.897 --> 02:25:41.599
AND REST HOWEVER.

02:25:41.666 --> 02:25:44.202
WE ALWAYS HAVE PRETENDERS RIGHT

02:25:44.268 --> 02:25:46.304
WE NEED TO BE AWARE OF AND IS

02:25:46.370 --> 02:25:47.505
THERE ANYTHING IN THE BILL OF

02:25:47.572 --> 02:25:48.973
THE COOPERATE TO TO HAVE.

02:25:49.040 --> 02:25:50.408
REQUIRES A CERTAIN DEGREE OF

02:25:50.475 --> 02:25:51.876
COOPERATION THAT ARE THERE WAS

02:25:51.943 --> 02:25:53.711
AN ACTUAL CRIME COMMITTED THAT

THE REPORTING.

02:25:56.147 --> 02:25:57.548

I THANK YOU FOR THAT.

02:25:59.250 --> 02:26:00.084
QUESTION I THINK IT'S REALLY

02:26:00.151 --> 02:26:01.619
IMPORTANT TO TWO THINGS

02:26:01.686 --> 02:26:03.321
DISTINGUISH FIRST OF ALL OF THIS

02:26:03.387 --> 02:26:05.623
IS NOT ABOUT -- IN TERMS OF THE

02:26:05.690 --> 02:26:07.191
IMMUNITY FROM ARREST OUT THE

02:26:07.258 --> 02:26:09.160
CONDOM PEACE BUT THE REPORTING A

02:26:09.227 --> 02:26:10.828
CRIME PLEASE THIS IS NOT ABOUT

02:26:10.895 --> 02:26:12.830
IMMUNITY A TRIAL WHERE.

02:26:12.897 --> 02:26:14.365
YOU MIGHT TALK ABOUT NEEDING

02:26:14.432 --> 02:26:15.666
COOPERATION BECAUSE YOU'RE IN

02:26:15.733 --> 02:26:17.268
THE SETTING OF A TRIAL THIS IS

02:26:17.335 --> 02:26:19.170
ABOUT A VERY QUICK DECISION THAT

02:26:19.237 --> 02:26:21.239
A POLICE OFFICER MAKES -- SHOULD

02:26:21.305 --> 02:26:23.207
I OR SHOULD I NOT ARREST THIS

02:26:23.274 --> 02:26:25.076
PERSON SO ON TO MY EYES IN A

02:26:25.143 --> 02:26:27.378
SCENARIO WHERE A SEX WORKER

02:26:27.445 --> 02:26:29.580
APPROACH IS A POLICE OFFICER --

02:26:29.647 --> 02:26:32.550
AND SAYS I WAS ON MY I WAS JUST

02:26:32.617 --> 02:26:36.387
RATE ON AND OR I WAS JUST.

02:26:36.454 --> 02:26:42.059
ROBBED -- OR MY THAT MY JOHN --

02:26:42.126 --> 02:26:43.694
JUST BEAT THE HECK OUT OF ME.

02:26:43.761 --> 02:26:48.099
I AND I THE THE OFFICER ON IT

02:26:48.166 --> 02:26:49.367
THIS IS NOT SOME SORT OF

02:26:49.433 --> 02:26:50.368
COURTROOM SETTING WHERE YOU'RE

02:26:50.434 --> 02:26:51.035
GOING TO SAY WHAT'S THE

02:26:51.102 --> 02:26:53.104
CORROBORATION RIGHT THERE MAKING

02:26:53.171 --> 02:26:54.906
A DECISION RIGHT THEN AND THERE.

02:26:54.972 --> 02:26:57.842
ON WHETHER TO ARREST AND I AND I

02:26:57.909 --> 02:26:58.910
THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO

02:26:58.976 --> 02:27:00.545
KEEP IN MIND WE'VE BEEN VERY

02:27:00.611 --> 02:27:01.979
FOCUSED WITH THE BILL'S VERY

02:27:02.046 --> 02:27:02.580
FOCUSED.

02:27:02.647 --> 02:27:04.682
THAT THE ONLY CRIMES THAT YOU

02:27:04.749 --> 02:27:06.517
REPORT THAT WOULD TRIGGER THIS

02:27:06.584 --> 02:27:07.084
ARE.

02:27:07.151 --> 02:27:09.820
ARE SERIOUS VIOLENT CRIMES LIKE

02:27:09.887 --> 02:27:11.289
RAPE LIKE KIDNAPPING LIKE HUMAN

02:27:11.355 --> 02:27:12.523
TRAFFICKING.

02:27:12.590 --> 02:27:13.758
AND THE CRIMES.

02:27:13.824 --> 02:27:15.326
THAT YOU FOR WHICH YOU ARE

02:27:15.393 --> 02:27:18.062
IMMUNIZED HARASSED OR CRIMES

02:27:18.129 --> 02:27:19.830
THAT I ARE NOT PARTICULARLY

02:27:19.897 --> 02:27:22.066
SERIOUS POSSESSION OF DRUGS.

02:27:22.133 --> 02:27:24.969
PROSTITUTION LOITERING BEING A

02:27:25.036 --> 02:27:27.838
NEW SENSE OF THE THESE ARE NAY

02:27:27.905 --> 02:27:29.173
SO WE WHEN YOU BALANCE -- WHAT

02:27:29.240 --> 02:27:32.276
WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT I MAKING

02:27:32.343 --> 02:27:34.245
IT AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE FOR

02:27:34.312 --> 02:27:35.780
PEOPLE TO REPORT THE MOST

02:27:35.846 --> 02:27:43.721
HEINOUS CRIMES THAT ARE A THREAT

02:27:43.788 --> 02:27:44.589
TO THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY?

02:27:44.655 --> 02:27:46.224
OR POTENTIALLY IF SOMEONE DOES.

02:27:46.290 --> 02:27:47.358
HE OUGHT NOT HAVING THEM BE

02:27:47.425 --> 02:27:48.092
ARRESTED FOR LOITERING OR FOR

02:27:48.159 --> 02:27:48.693
COMMITTING A NEW SENSE I THINK

02:27:48.759 --> 02:27:49.260
WHEN YOU BALANCE THE RISK.

02:27:49.327 --> 02:27:51.495
THE RISK OF A VIOLENT PERSON

02:27:51.562 --> 02:27:53.531
BEING FREE ON THE STREET OR THE

02:27:53.598 --> 02:27:55.800
RISK OF NOT ARRESTING SOMEONE

02:27:55.866 --> 02:27:57.435
FOR ENGAGING IN LOITERING IT'S

02:27:57.501 --> 02:27:59.036
NOT EVEN A CLOSE CALL I WOULD

02:27:59.103 --> 02:28:00.805
RATHER WE ERR ON THE SIDE.

02:28:00.871 --> 02:28:02.206
OF PROTECTING NOT JUST THE SEX

02:28:02.273 --> 02:28:04.242
WORKERS BUT EVERYONE FROM A

02:28:04.308 --> 02:28:06.244
VIOLENT PERSON ON THE STREET AND

02:28:06.310 --> 02:28:07.411
AND SO I DON'T THINK THERE'S A

02:28:07.478 --> 02:28:08.579
NEED.

02:28:08.646 --> 02:28:09.814
FOR COOPERATION WHATEVER THAT

02:28:09.880 --> 02:28:12.183
WOULD MEAN HERE -- I THINK THAT

02:28:12.250 --> 02:28:13.117
WE STRUCK.

02:28:13.184 --> 02:28:14.852
A GOOD BALANCE I UNDERSTAND WHAT

02:28:14.919 --> 02:28:16.420
THE POINT OF SAYING BUT I THINK

02:28:16.487 --> 02:28:18.589
THIS IS THE RIGHT BALANCE FOR

02:28:18.656 --> 02:28:20.658
PUBLIC SAFETY HERE.

02:28:20.725 --> 02:28:22.793
THIS WAS GONNA GET A THANK YOU

02:28:22.860 --> 02:28:23.761
AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS

02:28:23.828 --> 02:28:24.662

02:28:24.729 --> 02:28:28.032
I'M GLAD THAT YOU -- JUST MADE

02:28:28.099 --> 02:28:29.634

AS YOUR TRADING YOU KNOW A

02:28:31.235 --> 02:28:33.504
MISDEMEANOR FOR A FELONY -- AND

02:28:33.571 --> 02:28:35.473
WE WOULD MUCH RATHER BE FOCUSED

02:28:35.539 --> 02:28:37.975
ON THOSE -- YOU KNOW FELONY --

02:28:38.042 --> 02:28:39.610
CHARGES AND CONVICTIONS AND I

I ALSO THINK THOUGH IF YOU KNOW

02:28:51.656 --> 02:28:52.390
THE EVIDENCE THAT THE

02:28:52.456 --> 02:28:54.959
PROSECUTION IS WEIGHING ON IS

02:28:55.026 --> 02:28:55.826
YOU KNOW HAVING A STACK OF

02:28:55.893 --> 02:28:57.762
CONDOMS YOU KNOW IN YOUR PURSE

02:28:57.828 --> 02:28:58.896
OR IN YOUR POCKET THEN.

02:28:58.963 --> 02:29:01.632
THAT COULD BE A WEAK CASE MAY

02:29:01.699 --> 02:29:04.335
