HSS SERVICE PROVIDERS AND LESS THAT BARGAIN AGREEMENT IS RENEWED WITHIN NINETY DAYS OF FACT FINDING THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO JUSTIFICATION FOR WITHHOLDING THOSE FUNDS I URGE A NO VOTE.

SENATE BILL EIGHTY ONE BY THE COMMITTEE ON BUDGET AND FISCAL REVIEW AND ACTUALLY THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES MAKING A PREPARATION THEREFORE TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY BILL RELATES TO THE BUDGET. MR TANK. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER SB EIGHTY ONE IS OUR DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES TRAILER BILL YOU'RE ALL AWARE THAT. THERE WAS A STUDY RELEASED SAYING THAT WE HAVE -- ONE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLAR SHORTFALL IN OUR DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES FUNDING. WHILE WE WERE NOT ABLE TO MAKE AND CLOSE THAT GAP THIS YEAR THIS IS A HUGE DOWN PAYMENT TOWARD THE EFFORT ONE OF THE LARGEST ON GOING COMMITMENT THAT WE MADE THIS YEAR WHICH WAS A TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLAR. GENERAL FUND ONGOING ALLOCATION FOR BROAD BASE RATE INCREASED EFFECTIVE JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY IN ADDITION IN THE TRAILER BILL WE COMMITTED TO FURTHERING WORK TOGETHER TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN CLOSE THE GAP. BY WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WORKING WITH ARE VERY STAKEHOLDERS WORKING WITH ALL OUR KEY PARTNERS UP AND DOWN THE STATE BECAUSE WE KNOW THE POP THE POPULATIONS GROWING. AND THE NEED IS GROWING WE REALLY NEED TO GET AHEAD OF THIS CURVE. AGAIN -- WE ALSO HAD MORE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY AROUND REGIONAL CENTERS INCLUDE IN THIS TRAILER BILL -- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE ARE INVESTING DOLLARS THAT THESE REGIONAL CENTERS ARE WORKING AS FAST AS POSSIBLE TO SERVICE IS VERY IMPORTANT POPULATION. SO WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR I DON'T ON SB. EIGHTY ONE THANK YOU MISTER CHANG MISTER OBERNOLTE ARE RECOGNIZED I THINK THIS IS BIGGER RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE THE EIGHTY ONE THE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN. PROVIDER RATE INCREASES AT THIS BILL AND ACTS ARE DESPERATELY NEEDED IN CALIFORNIA HOWEVER AS THE BUDGET YEAR POINTED OUT. THE ADMINISTRATION'S OWN RATE STUDY RELEASED EARLIER THIS YEAR SAYS THAT OVER ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. OF ADDITIONAL RATE INCREASES AS NECESSARY JUST TO BRING RATES UP TO WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD THEY NOT BEEN FROZEN FOR THE LAST DECADE. ALSO A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED THAT THIS TRAILER BILL DOES NOT ENACT A PERMANENT SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS OF UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE AND HALF THE BILLING THAT HAVE BEEN PLAGUING OUR DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES FOR MANY YEARS NOW. THIS IS A DROP IN THE BUCKET A HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS AGAINST A ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR NEED IS ACTUALLY VERY DISAPPOINTING. AND I WISH THAT MORE HAD BEEN DONE THIS YEAR WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM AND WE FAILED TO DO IT BUT NONETHELESS THIS BILL MOVES THE BALL IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. SO I URGE AN AYE VOTE. MR LACKEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. I COULD HAVE YOUR ATTENTION FOR JUST A MINUTE I THINK THAT THIS IS A VERY VERY SAD REFLECTION ON THIS BODY. WE'VE BEEN TALKING SINCE I'VE BEEN IN THIS INSTITUTION. WE'VE BEEN PROMISING THIS PART OF OUR POPULATION WE'RE GOING TO GET TO YOU WE'RE GOING TO HELP YOU. FOLKS IT'S REALLY DISGUSTING THAT WE HAVE SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE WE'VE HAD. SURPLUS AFTER SURPLUS AFTER SURPLUS. BUT YET. WE'LL GIVE YOU A DOWN PAYMENT. WHAT THE HECK IS THAT? A DOWN PAYMENT. IT'S LIKE YOU'RE WALKING PAST SOMEBODY. A PERSON WHO'S DYING OF THIRST. AND YOU LOOK AT THAT PERSON YOU SAY I HAVE A SPRAY BOTTLE I'M GONNA BE COMPASSIONATE WOULD GIVE YOU A COUPLE SPORTS OF MISSED [inaudible] GOOD LUCK. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING. THIS IS SAD. THIS IS VERY SAD AND HERE'S THE OTHER REALITY IF YOU VOTE NO. ON THIS DAY LOOKS LIKE YOU CARE. NOT AT ALL. IT'S TERRIBLE. AND WHAT WHAT WE'VE DONE WE SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF OURSELVES BECAUSE OF THESE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ADVOCATES LIKE MANY OF THESE OTHER WORTHY CAUSES HAVE. THEY COME IN THEY THEY TELL US HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS AND HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS THIS IS THE WORLD FOR THESE PEOPLE. THESE PEOPLE EXPECT US TO HELP THEM. AND WHAT ARE WE DOING WITH DR I'M TONY SOME OF THE SERVICES ARE GONE NOW. IF WE SUPPORT THIS AND THIS IS ALL WE HAVE TO OFFER MANY OF THESE SERVICES ARE GONE. LIKE I HAVE ALL THE ISSUES THAT I'M GONNA DRESS BUT I'VE SAID ENOUGH. THIS IS. REALLY REALLY EMBARRASSING WE SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF OURSELVES AND THIS DOWN PAYMENT STUFF DOESN'T CUT IT I'M SORRY. MR FRAZIER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER-- LAYS IN GERMAN I WILL TELL YOU. THAT EVERYTHING'S BEEN SAID TODAY'S TRUE. BUT I WILL ALSO TELL YOU. THAT AFTER DOING A HEARINGS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS THE CHAIR OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE FOR INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED POPULATION CALIFORNIA. THAT WE NEED. TO NOT ONLY MONEY. BUT MONIES AFTER THE FACT. WE NEED TO RESTRUCTURE. THE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY THE REGIONAL CENTERS. BUT YOU ALSO HAVE TO PUT IN PLACE. THE ABILITY TO HAVE PROVIDERS. WE CAN THROW AS MUCH MONEY AT THIS ISSUE AS WE WANT. BUT IT WON'T. FIX WHAT'S WRONG. WE NEED TO BUILD THE PLAN. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO CERTIFY WORKFORCE SO THEY CAN MAKE MORE MONEY. RIGHT NOW WE'RE THEIR RELEGATED IS MINIMUM WAGE WORKERS. AND I DON'T WANT TO DISPARAGE HIM BECAUSE I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING THAT THEY DO. BUT WE'RE ACTUALLY CREATING BABYSITTERS. WHAT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO IS CREATE A CERTIFICATE? OF PROFICIENCY. THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO ADVANCE THE NEEDS OF THE SPECIAL NEEDS POPULATION. THE PROVIDERS ARE AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE WHEN YOU TALK TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS OR FAMILIES WHO HAVE A LOVED ONE WHO IS SPECIAL NEEDS. ARE THEY GETTING THE APPROPRIATE SERVICES [inaudible] PROBABLY NOT. BUT THE ONES THAT ARE THANK GOD THAT THEY ARE. SO FOR EVERY BAD THING THAT YOU HEAR THERE'S A GOOD. THERE ARE GOOD THINGS ARE HAPPENING FOR THE POPULATION ALSO. BUT WE NEED TO WORK FROM THE AND START PLANNING BACKWARDS FROM THE PROVIDERS FROM THE WORK FORCE WE NEED TO BUILD THAT. THEN WE CAN ASSURE HOW MUCH MONEY WE NEED.

ASSEMBLY BILL NINETY ONE BY FAMILY MEMBER BURKE AND OTHERS AND EXPLAIN TO TAXATION MAKING APPROPRIATION THEREFORE TO CLIMB THE URGENCY THERE UP TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY. MS BERKLEY AVAILABLE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I MEMBERS I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT AB NINETY ONE THE LOOPHOLE CLOSERS SMALL BUSINESS AND WORKING FAMILIES TAX RELIEF ACT OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE SPEAKER IN ALL OF THE MEMBERS FOR THEIR HARD WORK AND BRING. THIS BILL TO THE FLOOR AS WELL AS THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS BOLD INITIATIVE. AB NINETY ONE MAKE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN PROVIDERS TANGIBLE BENEFITS IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS. IT PROVIDES TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION IN RELIEF BY SIMPLIFYING ACCOUNTING RULES FOR SMALL BUSINESS WITH UP TO TWENTY FIVE MILLION IN GROSS RECEIPTS BY ALLOWING THEM TO LIKE CASH RATHER THAN A MORE COMPLICATED ACCRUAL METHOD. OF ACCOUNTING. STUDENT LOANS OR DISCHARGE DUE TO DEATH OR DISABILITY WILL NO LONGER BE INCLUDED IN GROSS INCOME THIS BILL WILL ALSO HELP THE NEEDIEST IN OUR SOCIETY BY ALLOWING INDIVIDUALS TO ROLL OVER FUNDS FROM THE FIVE TWENTY NINE EDUCATION ACCOUNT. TO AN ABLE ACCOUNT WITHOUT PENALTY AND INCREASING THE AMOUNT THAT A BENEFIT FOR YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR OWN ABLE ACCOUNT. IT IMPROVES THE STATE'S LONG TERM FINANCIAL STABILITY BY CLOSING A SERIES OF LOOPHOLES THAT PROVIDE UNJUSTIFIED TAX BREAKS A BIT SPECIFICALLY IT WOULD CLOSE THE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION LOOPHOLE. LIMIT THE LOSSES ON NON CORPORATE TAXPAYERS THAT CAN BE TAKEN IN ANY GIVEN YEAR. ELIMINATE AND NO WELL KERRY BACK SO THE NEXT TIME WE ENTER INTO RECESSION WE WON'T HAVE TO CUT HEALTH CARE SCHOOLS OR OTHER VITAL SOCIAL AND PUBLIC SAFETY SERVICES. REPEAL THE TECHNICAL TERMINATION OF PARTNERSHIPS. AND AND THE TECHNICAL. TERMINATION OF PARTNERSHIPS. AS CHAIR OF THE REVENUE AND TAX COMMITTEE I AM ACUTELY AWARE. OF THE DIRECT IMPACT TAX POLICY ON THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIANS. NOWHERE IS THIS IMPACT CLEARER THAN IN THE CASE OF THE CALIFORNIA EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. AND ALL THE CO THOUGH THE CREDIT HAS BEEN A VITAL PART OF LIFTING FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE. THIS BILL WILL EXTEND THE CREDIT TO INDIVIDUALS MAKING UP TO THIRTY THOUSAND A YEAR. INCREASE THE CREDIT PROGRAM BY AN ADDITIONAL SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. PROVIDES A NEW YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT OF ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN UNDER. SIX CALIFORNIA IS THE RICHEST STATE IN THE COUNTRY AND YET WE HAVE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN LIVING IN DEEP POVERTY. THESE ARE FAMILIES OF FOUR THAT ARE LIVING ON UNDER THIRTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. THEY HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN KEEPING THE LIGHTS ON AND PUTTING FOOD ON THE TABLE. THEY LIE AWAKE AT NIGHT WORRIED ABOUT PAYING THE RENT. THEY ARE THE WORKING POOR AND THEY ARE STRUGGLING. THEY NEED THIS HELP AND THEY WORK EVERY DAY TO EARN IT. IT IS ON THEIR BEHALF. THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE BILL. THANK YOU MS BURKE MISS ROBIN ONLY THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO AB. NINETY ONE THIS BILL AN AXE SELECTIVE CONFORMITY WITH FEDERAL TAX LAW AND USES SOME OF THE SAVINGS FROM THAT CONFORMITY TO FUND AN INCREASE IN THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. HOWEVER THE ITEMS THAT THIS BILL SELECTS TO CONFORM WITH SALIM VERY SELECTIVELY CHOSEN. TO MAXIMIZE STATE REVENUE RATHER THAN AN HONEST. EFFORT TO CONFORM TO FEDERAL TAX LAW AND LET ME GIVE YOU JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF THAT WHICH THE TREATMENT OF LIKE A KIND EXCHANGES. THE FEDERAL TAX CUT AND JOB ACTS OF LAST YEAR. ELIMINATED LIKE KIND EXCHANGES FOR MANY TYPES OF PROPERTY BUT AT THE SAME TIME ENACTED CHANGES TO THE STATE'S DEPRECIATION RULES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT APPRECIATION RULES. THAT MADE IT SO THE MOST TAXPAYERS WERE NOT HARMED BY THIS ACTION HOWEVER THIS BILL ELIMINATES LIKE KIND OF CHANGES WITHOUT CONFORMING TO TAX CODE ON FIRST YEAR EXPENSING. AND I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A CONCRETE EXAMPLE OF WHAT THAT MEANS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S VERY LITTLE UNDERSTOOD LET'S SAY THAT YOU OWN A SMALL BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA. AND THAT YOU INVEST A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN A NEW COMPUTER SYSTEM FOR YOUR BUSINESS AND LET'S SAY A FEW YEARS LATER THAT YOUR BUSINESS HAS GROWN AND YOU NEED A NEW COMPUTER SYSTEM. AND THAT YOU CAN SYSTEM WILL COST YOU TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU BY THE NEW SYSTEM. AND YOU SELL YOUR OLD SYSTEM FOR FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WELL UNDER CURRENT STATE LAW YOU DECLARE A LIKE KIND EXCHANGE SO THE FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT YOU GOT FOR YOUR OLD SYSTEM. IS CREDITED AGAINST THE NEW SYSTEM AND YOU DEPRECIATE THE NEW SYSTEM AT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND IF YOU PASS THIS BILL TODAY. YOU WILL REQUIRE BUSINESS OWNERS TO PAY INCOME TAX ON THE FIFTY THOUSAND THEY GOT FOR THEIR OLD SYSTEM EVEN THOUGH THE FACT THEY NEVER EVEN GOT THAT MONEY. THEY WENT ALL INTO AN INVESTMENT IN THE NEW SYSTEM THAT IS NOT CLOSING A LOOP HOLE THAT IS NOT FAIR AND THAT IS NOT CONFORMITY. YESTERDAY IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE WE HEARD TESTIMONY FROM SEVERAL AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS WHO TESTIFIED THAT THIS WILL CREATE IT SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER LEASE RATES FOR ANY AUTOMOBILE LEAST IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S BECAUSE THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE LEASING COMPANIES TO PAY INCOME TAX ON THE VALUE. OF THE VEHICLES AT THAT I'LL TRADE BACK IN ON NEW VEHICLES. DO YOU EVERYONE IN THIS CHAMBER SHOULD CARE ABOUT THAT PARTICULARLY IF YOU CARE ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN ENERGY GOALS BECAUSE WE ALL WANT INCENTIVIZE NEW ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN CALIFORNIA WILL GUESS WHAT -- OVER 90% OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE LEAST THEY'RE NOT PURCHASED AND OF THOSE ARE MORE EXPENSIVE FEWER PEOPLE WILL BUY THEM. SO THIS BILL DEFINITELY NEEDS SOME -- SOME MORE BAKING OTHER PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL THAT ARE SUPPORTABLE BUT THE THE PROVISIONS ON TAX CONFORMITY REALLY NEED TO BE RETHOUGHT I URGE A NO VOTE. MS RACE YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS ALTHOUGH I AM GLAD TO SEE SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION TO THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT OR EITC. IN THIS BILL I AM STILL DISAPPOINTED THAT THE CREDIT CONTINUES TO EXCLUDE PEOPLE FILE WITH AN INDIVIDUAL TAX IDENTIFICATION NUMBER OR NINETEEN AND EXPANSION OF THE AYE TO SEEK TO INDIVIDUALS WITH ITUNES WAS PRESENT. IN BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE VERSIONS OF THE BUDGET WHAT HAS BEEN REMOVED AS A PART OF THE LARGER NEGOTIATION AROUND TAX STRUCTURE. IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT INDIVIDUALS WITH I TUNES ARE TAXPAYERS. AND THE PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THEIR LOCAL ECONOMIES YET THEY DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO CRITICAL SERVICES MEANT TO SUPPORT LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. THIS ACT TO TRULY BE A WORKING FAMILIES TAX RELIEF IT SHOULD SUPPORT ALL FAMILIES AND NOT SURE CHANGE LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. OR EVEN ONE PERSON IN THE HOUSEHOLD FILES AND I WITH AN AYE TEN THE ENTIRE FAMILY IS DENIED THE CREDIT. I AM COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE AND HOPE THAT THIS LEGISLATURE. WILL FOLLOW THROUGH FOR LOW INCOME IMMIGRANTS. AND LOW INCOME IMMIGRANT FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE THANK YOU. THERE WAS RESIDENTS KILEY YOUR RECOGNIZE. I THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER COLLEAGUES -- I THINK THERE'S A REAL MISSED OPPORTUNITY IN THIS BILL AND THAT THERE'S NO CONFORMITY WITH FEDERAL OPPORTUNITIES OWN TAX BENEFITS. OPPORTUNITIES OWNS ARE A NEW BIPARTISAN TOOL FOR COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DESIGN TO PROVIDE TAX INCENTIVES DELP UNLOCK CAPITAL TO INVEST IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. UNDER FEDERAL LAW INVESTORS CAN NOW TO FOR PAYING TAX ON CAPITAL GAINS IF THOSE GAINS ARE INVESTED IN QUALIFIED OPPORTUNITY FUNDS THAT IN TURN INVEST IN ECONOMICALLY DISTRESSED COMMUNITIES. IN ADDITION TO THE DEFERRAL OF GAME LONG TERM INVESTMENT IS INCENTIVIZE BY ALLOWING FOR A MODEST STEP UP IN BASIS FOR INVESTMENTS. AS AN ADDITIONAL INCENTIVE TO MAKE A LONG TERM PATIENT CAPITAL INVESTMENTS TAXPAYERS HOLDING OPPORTUNITY FUND INVESTMENTS FOR A PERIOD OF AT LEAST TEN YEARS. ARE EXEMPT FROM ANY ADDITIONAL GAINES BEYOND THAT WHICH WAS PREVIOUSLY INVESTED. FOLLOWING ADD THESE CHANGES THE FEDERAL TAX LAW MOST STATES HAVE FOLLOWED SUIT. AT LEAST FORTY STATES EITHER DON'T HAVE TAX CAPITAL GAINS OR HAVE FULL OR PARTIAL CONFORMITY WITH THE NEW FEDERAL OPPORTUNITY TAX ON BENEFITS BUT CALIFORNIA STILL ISN'T ONE OF THEM. AT A CRITICAL TIME WHEN INVESTORS WILL BE MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT WHERE TO INVEST THIS PUTS US AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE AS FAR AS ATTRACTING CAPITAL FOR HOUSING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED IT MOST SO I HOPE WE CAN CONNECT CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT CONFORMITY WITH FEDERAL OPPORTUNITIES OWN TAX BENEFITS AND TAKE PROPER ACTION SO THE CALIFORNIA CAN REAP THE FULL BENEFITS OF OPPORTUNITIES OUT ITS THANK YOU. SEE NO ADDITIONAL THE DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE ITEM. MS BURKE YOU MAY CLOSE.
