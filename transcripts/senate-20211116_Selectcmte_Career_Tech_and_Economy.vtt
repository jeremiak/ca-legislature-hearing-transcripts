WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD-

00:09:38.144 --> 00:09:40.146
WHAT SIZE I SHOULD PRIMARILY A

00:09:40.212 --> 00:09:42.281
POLICY ENTITY HOWEVER. OVER THE

00:09:42.348 --> 00:09:43.482
LAST SEVERAL YEARS WE'VE TAKEN

00:09:43.549 --> 00:09:45.751
ON MORE OF A PROGRAM ROLE-

00:09:45.818 --> 00:09:46.819
INVESTING IN DEMONSTRATION

00:09:46.886 --> 00:09:49.322
PROJECTS THAT WOULD HELP INFORM

00:09:49.388 --> 00:09:51.657
POLICY BUT ALSO DRIVE POLICY- SO

00:09:51.724 --> 00:09:52.792
WE'VE WE'VE KIND OF DEVELOPED

00:09:52.858 --> 00:09:54.593
THIS I THINK DO TANK- KIND OF

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.262
APPROACH. TO THE WORK WHERE

00:09:56.329 --> 00:09:57.830
WE'RE INVESTING TO DRIVE A

00:09:57.897 --> 00:09:58.864
SYSTEM CHANGE BUT WE'RE ALSO

00:09:58.931 --> 00:10:00.833
LEARNING FROM THOSE INVESTMENTS.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.970
IN WAYS THAT INFORM POLICY I'M-

00:10:04.036 --> 00:10:06.105
SORRY I THE CHALLENGE. THAT I

00:10:06.172 --> 00:10:11.077
WANTED TO PUT FORWARD REALLY.

00:10:11.143 --> 00:10:12.645
QUICKLY IS. A MY- THE COME UP

00:10:12.712 --> 00:10:14.313
FROM LOOKING AT THE PROGRAM DATA

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.948
AND THE WAY WE'VE WE'VE BEEN

00:10:16.015 --> 00:10:16.649
ABLE TO ANALYZE AND DO A

00:10:16.716 --> 00:10:18.918
VALUATION WHAT. IS IT ISN'T THIS

00:10:18.985 --> 00:10:20.920
THE SYSTEM ITSELF NEEDS TO BE RE

00:10:20.987 --> 00:10:22.755
EVALUATED REEVALUATE- THE

00:10:22.822 --> 00:10:25.725
TRADITIONAL APPROACH. TO FIX.

00:10:25.791 --> 00:10:27.593
THAT FOCUSES ON INDIVIDUALS AND

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:29.261
THE HOPE THAT. PROGRAM

00:10:29.328 --> 00:10:31.831
PARTICIPANTS- ARE COMPETITIVE

00:10:31.897 --> 00:10:34.066
ENOUGH TO LAND A JOB. THIS IS

00:10:34.133 --> 00:10:36.035
THE KIND OF WAY THE TRADITIONAL

00:10:36.102 --> 00:10:37.770
SYSTEM WORKS IT GIVES PEOPLE

00:10:37.837 --> 00:10:39.739
WHAT WE THINK. WILL MAKE THEM

00:10:39.805 --> 00:10:41.907
COMPETITIVE IN IN IN LABOR

00:10:41.974 --> 00:10:42.742
MARKETS WE SORT OF PUSH THEM OUT

00:10:42.808 --> 00:10:44.877
AND HOPE THEY LAND. A LOT OF

00:10:44.944 --> 00:10:46.579
FOLKS CALL THAT TRAINING PRAY.

00:10:46.645 --> 00:10:49.081
YOU MENTION THAT- GRACE THE

00:10:49.148 --> 00:10:50.783
QUESTION ARE WE TRAINING PEOPLE

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:52.585
FOR JOBS THAT ACTUALLY EXIST.

00:10:52.651 --> 00:10:53.152
ARE WE DOING RIGHT BY THESE

00:10:53.219 --> 00:10:55.121
TRAINEES. AND I WOULD SAY IN THE

00:10:55.187 --> 00:10:57.823
MICRO SENSE. IT DOES WORK TO

00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:59.325
GIVE AN INDIVIDUAL A LEG UP IN

00:10:59.392 --> 00:11:01.527
COMPETITIVE LABOR MARKETS IN THE

00:11:01.594 --> 00:11:03.529
COMPETITION FOR A QUALITY JOB.

00:11:03.596 --> 00:11:04.964
BUT IN THE MACRO SENSE IT IT IT

00:11:05.031 --> 00:11:06.766
DOESN'T HOLD UP AS WELL- BECAUSE

00:11:06.832 --> 00:11:08.834
WE'RE BUILDING COMPETITION FOR

00:11:08.901 --> 00:11:10.569
TOO FEW GOOD JOBS AND AT THE END

00:11:10.636 --> 00:11:12.071
OF THE DAY. WHEN WE DO THAT

00:11:12.138 --> 00:11:14.206
THERE'S A DOWNWARD PRESSURE. OR

00:11:14.273 --> 00:11:18.044
EFFECT ON WAGES. AND THEY WERE

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:18.744
VERY. VERY REAL HISTORICAL

00:11:18.811 --> 00:11:20.379
IMPACTS OF PRIVILEGE AND RACE

00:11:20.446 --> 00:11:21.981
AND GENDER ON WHO AND WHAT

00:11:22.048 --> 00:11:23.115
GROUPS WENT OUT THAT SORT OF

00:11:23.182 --> 00:11:25.618
COMPETITION. SO IN THIS WAY IF

00:11:25.684 --> 00:11:27.720
OUR IF OUR END GAME IS EQUITY.

00:11:27.787 --> 00:11:29.388
IT'S NOT SET UP FOR US TO REALLY

00:11:29.455 --> 00:11:31.457
MOVE THE NEEDLE ON EQUITY ACROSS

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:32.558
THE ST REGIS ACROSS THE STATE OF

00:11:32.625 --> 00:11:33.993
CALIFORNIA. SO WHAT WE'RE

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:34.927
THINKING OF THE STATE WORKFORCE

00:11:34.994 --> 00:11:36.228
BOARD IS REALLY TURNING THIS

00:11:36.295 --> 00:11:37.263
TRADITIONAL APPROACH ON ITS

00:11:37.329 --> 00:11:39.131
HEAD. SO IN ADDITION TO

00:11:39.198 --> 00:11:41.167
PROVIDING INDIVIDUAL SERVICES.

00:11:41.233 --> 00:11:43.335
THE WORK FOR SYSTEM SHOULD ALSO

00:11:43.402 --> 00:11:43.836
BE WORKING TO CREATE THE

00:11:43.903 --> 00:11:46.038
CONDITIONS. TO PULL PEOPLE INTO

00:11:46.105 --> 00:11:47.373
GOOD JOBS TO SUPPORT REGIONAL

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.308
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ESPECIALLY

00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:50.443
AS YOU POINTED OUT WITH A

00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:51.143
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:53.546
INFRASTRUCTURE- TYPE TRAINING

00:11:53.612 --> 00:11:54.947
SERVICES DIRECTLY TO THE

00:11:55.014 --> 00:11:56.816
CREATION OF GOOD JOBS. AND THEN

00:11:56.882 --> 00:11:57.683
FINALLY TO IMPROVE EXISTING

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:59.552
JOBS. WE HAVE A LOT OF EMPLOYERS

00:11:59.618 --> 00:12:02.588
OUT. ASKING AND REACHING OUT

00:12:02.655 --> 00:12:03.355
EVEN TO A WORKFORCE BOARDS AND

00:12:03.422 --> 00:12:06.225
OTHER FOLKS- LOOKING FOR WAYS TO

00:12:06.292 --> 00:12:07.560
ATTRACT RETAIN RETAIN OUT

00:12:07.626 --> 00:12:08.761
WORKERS INJURED REDUCED

00:12:08.828 --> 00:12:10.629
TURNOVER. SO IT'S A REALLY GREAT

00:12:10.696 --> 00:12:12.364
TIME TO BE TALKING TO EMPLOYERS

00:12:12.431 --> 00:12:13.466
BECAUSE OUR OPEN TO THIS ABOUT

00:12:13.532 --> 00:12:15.601
JOB QUALITY HAD IMPROVED THAT TO

00:12:15.668 --> 00:12:16.368
GET A TEASE. AT THESE

00:12:16.435 --> 00:12:18.637
PRIORITIES- WE HAVE THIS THING

00:12:18.704 --> 00:12:20.806
THAT WE'RE DRIVING AT THE STATE

00:12:20.873 --> 00:12:21.407
WORKFORCE BILLBOARD CALLED THE

00:12:21.474 --> 00:12:22.842
HIGH ROAD AGENDA. I DON'T

00:12:22.908 --> 00:12:24.443
PRIORITIZE ECONOMIC EQUITY JOB

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.378
QUALITY AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE.

00:12:26.445 --> 00:12:27.346
AND THAT APPROACH STARTS WITH

00:12:27.413 --> 00:12:32.952
DEEP INDUSTRY ENGAGEMENT- AND.

00:12:33.018 --> 00:12:33.486
THE RELATED WORK IS SYSTEM

00:12:33.552 --> 00:12:34.153
ALIGNMENT. REGIONALLY IN. IN IN

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:35.488
A- STRENGTHENING THE ROLE OF.

00:12:35.554 --> 00:12:37.056
THE BASE ORGANIZATIONS. TO

00:12:37.123 --> 00:12:38.591
CONNECT MORE WORKERS FROM

00:12:38.657 --> 00:12:40.926
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THOSE.

00:12:40.993 --> 00:12:41.527
BEEN LOCKED OUT OF PROSPERITY

00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:44.230
FOR GENERATIONS. TO PATHWAYS TO

00:12:44.296 --> 00:12:46.932
QUALITY JOBS- AND- THIS RAISES

00:12:46.999 --> 00:12:49.435
A- QUESTION OR CHALLENGE WITH

00:12:49.502 --> 00:12:53.372
DATA COLLECTION- BECAUSE- BY THE

00:12:53.439 --> 00:12:54.874
WAY WE COLLECT PARTICIPANT DATA

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.743
OR PARTICIPANT DATA. DOESN'T GET

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:00.412
ANY OF THIS WORK- AND YOU GET

00:13:00.479 --> 00:13:01.747
WHAT YOU MEASURE SO WHAT YOU

00:13:01.814 --> 00:13:04.183
MEASURE- ACTUALLY DRIVES A LOT

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:05.050
OF THE ACTIVITIES IN THE

00:13:05.117 --> 00:13:06.118
BEHAVIOR OF THE WORK FORCE

00:13:06.185 --> 00:13:07.853
SYSTEM SO FOR NOT MEASURING AND

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.122
TRACKING. THESE MORE INTENSIVE

00:13:10.189 --> 00:13:11.457
DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES THAT

00:13:11.524 --> 00:13:12.658
LOCAL BOARDS IN COLLEGES

00:13:12.725 --> 00:13:14.260
ENGAGING REGIONALLY WITH

00:13:14.326 --> 00:13:16.061
INDUSTRY AND LABOR- THEY WERE

00:13:16.128 --> 00:13:16.962
NOT GOING TO GET THE ENERGY

00:13:17.029 --> 00:13:19.231
PLACED IN IN THOSE AREAS- SO

00:13:19.298 --> 00:13:20.466
IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A REAL

00:13:20.533 --> 00:13:21.433
CHALLENGE THAT I THINK DOESN'T

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.737
GET A DRESS WITH A PURCHASE

00:13:24.803 --> 00:13:26.105
PARTICIPANT DATA. OUCH I THINK

00:13:26.172 --> 00:13:27.573
I'LL STOP THERE I CENTERED

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.240
AROUND BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'VE GOT

00:13:28.307 --> 00:13:29.808
A LOT OF FOLKS TOO. BUT YOU WANT

00:13:29.875 --> 00:13:31.043
TO HEAR FROM AND ALL KIND OF

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:32.311
WAIT IN THE WINGS UNLESS YOU'VE

00:13:32.378 --> 00:13:34.113
GOT. OTHER QUESTIONS FOR ME.

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:36.715
WELL LET ME JUST- MAYBE ASK A

00:13:36.782 --> 00:13:37.650
QUESTION OR MAKE A COMMENT OR

00:13:37.716 --> 00:13:39.318
MAYBE DO BOTH. YOU KNOW ONE OF

00:13:39.385 --> 00:13:42.121
MY CONCERNS WAS THAT. WE DON'T

00:13:42.188 --> 00:13:44.657
REALLY HAVE DETAILED INFORMATION

00:13:44.723 --> 00:13:47.526
AS TO THE SPECIFIC TYPES OF JOBS

00:13:47.593 --> 00:13:48.727
FOR WHICH THEY'RE OPENINGS AND

00:13:48.794 --> 00:13:50.663
FOR WHICH EMPLOYERS. PUBLIC AND

00:13:50.729 --> 00:13:52.531
PRIVATE NEED EMPLOYEES IN

00:13:52.598 --> 00:13:55.067
PARTICULAR REGIONS. AND IF TRUE

00:13:55.134 --> 00:13:56.669
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU LOOK IT'S

00:13:56.735 --> 00:13:58.537
STANDARD OCCUPATIONAL.

00:13:58.604 --> 00:13:59.872
CLASSIFICATIONS ARE SOME OF THE

00:13:59.939 --> 00:14:02.041
OTHER REPORTS. PARTICULARLY DOWN

00:14:02.107 --> 00:14:03.676
IN INLAND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

00:14:03.742 --> 00:14:05.945
WHERE I COME FROM AND THEY SAID

00:14:06.011 --> 00:14:07.012
WELL WE NEED THREE THOUSAND.

00:14:07.079 --> 00:14:08.914
WAREHOUSE WORKERS WHAT DOES THAT

00:14:08.981 --> 00:14:10.783
MEAN IS THAT A FORKLIFT OPERATOR

00:14:10.849 --> 00:14:12.718
IS AT A COMPUTERIZED INVENTORY

00:14:12.785 --> 00:14:15.020
CLERK. AND IT WOULD SEEM TO ME I

00:14:15.087 --> 00:14:16.188
THINK IT'S TRUE THAT THE

00:14:16.255 --> 00:14:17.590
TRAINING PROGRAM FOR EACH OF

00:14:17.656 --> 00:14:19.792
THOSE WOULD VERY SIGNIFICANTLY

00:14:19.858 --> 00:14:21.827
ONE FROM THE OTHER. SO IN ORDER

00:14:21.894 --> 00:14:23.362
TO DESIGN THE TRAINING PROGRAMS

00:14:23.429 --> 00:14:24.597
WHETHER YOU'RE IN THE COMMUNITY

00:14:24.663 --> 00:14:27.199
COLLEGE BUSINESS OR- THE PRIVATE

00:14:27.266 --> 00:14:29.134
SECTOR YOU NEED TO HAVE SOME.

00:14:29.201 --> 00:14:30.569
GRANULARITY AS TO WHAT THE

00:14:30.636 --> 00:14:32.037
NATURE OF THE SPECIFIC NATURE OF

00:14:32.104 --> 00:14:34.173
THE JOB IS IN THE- SKILLS THAT

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.608
ARE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO MEET

00:14:35.674 --> 00:14:37.977
THE NEED RIGHT. AND SO WHEN I

00:14:38.043 --> 00:14:42.014
RISK FOLKS. IN GOVERNMENT IN

00:14:42.081 --> 00:14:49.888
OUT- IF I NEEDED TO BE FILLED.

00:14:49.955 --> 00:14:51.257
TWENTY FIVE- COMPUTERIZED

00:14:51.323 --> 00:14:54.360
INVENTORY CLERKS POSITIONS THAT

00:14:54.426 --> 00:14:56.762
I HAVE WHO WOULD I CALL. AND

00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:59.131
WHERE WOULD I GO TO THE LODGE

00:14:59.198 --> 00:15:00.833
THIS DATA AND IF I TURN TO THE

00:15:00.899 --> 00:15:02.601
EDUCATORS AND I SAID WHERE WOULD

00:15:02.668 --> 00:15:04.303
YOU GO TO FIND OUT IF SOMEONE

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:06.805
NEEDS COMPUTERIZED INVENTORY

00:15:06.872 --> 00:15:07.373
CLERKS AND THE ANSWER IS WE

00:15:07.439 --> 00:15:09.575
DON'T KNOW. OR THERE ISN'T

00:15:09.642 --> 00:15:12.144
ANYBODY. AND I THINK THAT'S

00:15:12.211 --> 00:15:14.680
REALLY THE NATURE OF. PIECE OF

00:15:14.747 --> 00:15:16.882
THE PROBLEM AND THE OTHER PIECE

00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:18.284
OF THE PROBLEM IS THE DATA

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:20.819
COLLECTION SIMPLY FIGURING OUT

00:15:20.886 --> 00:15:22.988
THAT YOU KNOW WHAT THE AMOUNT OF

00:15:23.055 --> 00:15:25.658
MONEY IS THAT SOMEBODY IS EARNED

00:15:25.724 --> 00:15:28.227
WE NEED OCCUPATION WE NEED WAGE

00:15:28.294 --> 00:15:30.796
RATE WE NEED JOB LOCATION SO WE

00:15:30.863 --> 00:15:32.665
CAN SOMEHOW AND PERHAPS MORE. IN

00:15:32.731 --> 00:15:35.000
AN ENHANCED. LABOR MARKET

00:15:35.067 --> 00:15:36.635
INFORMATION SYSTEMS SO WE CAN

00:15:36.702 --> 00:15:39.271
PUT THE PIECES TOGETHER AND SO

00:15:39.338 --> 00:15:42.107
OUR EDUCATORS KNOW WHO TO TRAIN

00:15:42.174 --> 00:15:44.109
AND WHAT TO TRAIN THE MEN DO YOU

00:15:44.176 --> 00:15:46.045
AGREE WITH THAT RATHER LONG

00:15:46.111 --> 00:15:48.013
COMMENT THAT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.581
A QUESTION MARK AT THE END. I

00:15:49.648 --> 00:15:50.983
THINK IT WAS A TERRIFIC COMIC

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:52.751
NIGHT AND I AGREE COMPLETELY I

00:15:52.818 --> 00:15:54.720
DO TOO TWO ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS

00:15:54.787 --> 00:15:57.256
SO THAT IS. WHAT WE COULD USE

00:15:57.323 --> 00:15:59.625
MORE CORRECT GRANULAR- THAT DATA

00:15:59.692 --> 00:16:00.726
ON WHAT'S HAPPENING IN REGIONAL

00:16:00.793 --> 00:16:02.861
LABOR MARKETS OUT AND I THINK

00:16:02.928 --> 00:16:03.662
THAT MY COLLEAGUES ON THE ON

00:16:03.729 --> 00:16:06.465
THE- THE OTHER PANEL- COULD

00:16:06.532 --> 00:16:08.367
COULD ADDRESS THAT. THE WAY

00:16:08.434 --> 00:16:10.336
WE'VE BEEN GETTING AT IT IS THIS

00:16:10.402 --> 00:16:11.704
BUILDING THOSE PARTNERSHIPS WITH

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:12.971
INDUSTRY ON THE GRASS RIGHT THAT

00:16:13.038 --> 00:16:14.940
USING THE DATA THE LABOR MARKET

00:16:15.007 --> 00:16:15.641
DATA TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE

00:16:15.708 --> 00:16:17.609
TRENDS ARE. I WANT A LONG TERM

00:16:17.676 --> 00:16:19.144
PROJECTIONS ARE SO WE UNDERSTAND

00:16:19.211 --> 00:16:20.245
WHICH INDUSTRY SECTORS ARE

00:16:20.312 --> 00:16:22.214
REALLY DRIVING EMPLOYMENT- BUT

00:16:22.281 --> 00:16:24.049
THEN NOT RELYING ON THE DATA

00:16:24.116 --> 00:16:26.518
MUCH PAST THAT POINT- INSTEAD

00:16:26.585 --> 00:16:28.921
ENGAGING EMPLOYERS IN THE SECTOR

00:16:28.987 --> 00:16:29.355
SO THEY WERE HAVING

00:16:29.421 --> 00:16:31.156
CONVERSATIONS. AND COKE PLANNING

00:16:31.223 --> 00:16:32.758
WITH THEM ON WHAT THEIR NEEDS

00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:33.926
ARE GOING TO BE OVER THE NEXT

00:16:33.992 --> 00:16:34.927
TWO TO FIVE YEARS. AND IN

00:16:34.993 --> 00:16:36.228
RESPONDING TO THIS NEED SO

00:16:36.295 --> 00:16:37.996
THERE'S I THINK WE WANT WHENEVER

00:16:38.063 --> 00:16:39.131
WE COULD HAVE BETTER DATA BUT

00:16:39.198 --> 00:16:40.399
WE'RE NEVER GONNA GET AWAY FROM

00:16:40.466 --> 00:16:42.401
THE VALUE. OF THAT DIRECT

00:16:42.468 --> 00:16:44.336
CONNECTION WITH INDUSTRY BECAUSE

00:16:44.403 --> 00:16:45.204
THAT REAL TIME DATA IS ALWAYS

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:47.506
GOING TO BE- WHAT WE NEED TO

00:16:47.573 --> 00:16:48.907
MAKE A WORK FOR SYSTEM WORK ON

00:16:48.974 --> 00:16:50.075
BEHALF OF THE EMPLOYER AND JOB

00:16:50.142 --> 00:16:51.677
SEEKER. AND I THINK ON THE ON

00:16:51.744 --> 00:16:53.178
THE PERFORMANCE SIDE IN TERMS

00:16:53.245 --> 00:16:55.647
OF. OUTCOMES I AGREE WITH YOU

00:16:55.714 --> 00:16:57.783
THERE TOO I THINK WE NEED MORE

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:02.388
GRANULAR DATA THE WAY WE.

00:17:02.454 --> 00:17:02.988
COLLECTED WE FIRST USED. YOU

00:17:03.055 --> 00:17:05.190
SCALIGER- TO COLLECT PARTICIPANT

00:17:05.257 --> 00:17:09.661
DATA- AND THAT GIVES US- SOME OF

00:17:09.728 --> 00:17:11.497
WHAT WE NOT NOT NOT ALL. THEN WE

00:17:11.563 --> 00:17:13.999
RELY ON. SUPPLEMENTAL QUARTERLY

00:17:14.066 --> 00:17:15.601
REPORTS FROM OUR PROJECTS IN

00:17:15.667 --> 00:17:17.836
FROM EMPLOYERS- TO TELL US

00:17:17.903 --> 00:17:19.338
WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING ON THE

00:17:19.405 --> 00:17:21.440
GROUND TO GET US. A CLEAR SENSE

00:17:21.507 --> 00:17:22.040
OF WHAT'S WORKING WHAT'S NOT

00:17:22.107 --> 00:17:22.741
WORKING SO WE CAN MAKE

00:17:22.808 --> 00:17:23.976
ADJUSTMENTS ON THE ALONG THE

00:17:24.042 --> 00:17:25.444
WAY. AND THEN WE DO THIRD PARTY

00:17:25.511 --> 00:17:27.012
EVALUATIONS OF OUR PROBLEM OUR

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:29.314
PROJECT WORK. BUT THAT THOSE

00:17:29.381 --> 00:17:32.785
LAST TWO- WAYS OF GETTING AT IT.

00:17:32.851 --> 00:17:33.919
THE CALL COLLECTING A

00:17:33.986 --> 00:17:35.120
SUPPLEMENTAL QUARTERLY REPORTS

00:17:35.187 --> 00:17:37.055
PUTS AN ONUS ON EMPLOYERS AND

00:17:37.122 --> 00:17:38.757
THE PROJECTS. TO BE COSTLY

00:17:38.824 --> 00:17:39.992
PROVIDING US NARRATIVE REPORTS

00:17:40.058 --> 00:17:41.760
WHICH IS TIME CONSUMING- AND

00:17:41.827 --> 00:17:43.295
THEN THE THIRD PARTY EVALUATION

00:17:43.362 --> 00:17:45.197
WORK IS. YOU KNOW IT'S NOT IT'S

00:17:45.264 --> 00:17:46.532
NOT CHEAP EVEN THOUGH WE WORK

00:17:46.598 --> 00:17:49.701
WITH THE UC SYSTEM- WHICH GIVES

00:17:49.768 --> 00:17:51.837
US A GREAT VALUE- AND SOME OTHER

00:17:51.904 --> 00:17:52.438
ORGANIZATIONS DID YOU REALLY

00:17:52.504 --> 00:17:55.841
TERRIFIC WORK. IT IT IT IS. WHAT

00:17:55.908 --> 00:17:57.676
WE USED TO GET WHAT WE NEED AND

00:17:57.743 --> 00:18:00.312
I THINK WHAT YOU'RE- ASKING OF

00:18:00.379 --> 00:18:01.847
THE OTHER PANELISTS JUST GIVE

00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:02.448
YOU SOME IDEAS ON HOW WE CAN.

00:18:02.514 --> 00:18:04.683
AUTOMATE THAT. RIGHT AND GIVEN

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:05.984
THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT FLOWS

00:18:06.051 --> 00:18:07.453
THROUGH THE DREADED JOB TRAINING

00:18:07.519 --> 00:18:12.024
PIPELINE AND I THINK YOU WOULD.

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:12.691
AGREE THAT IS NOT INSUBSTANTIAL-

00:18:12.758 --> 00:18:14.359
IN FACT IT'S FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT

00:18:14.426 --> 00:18:16.628
AS IT SHOULD BE. EVEN MORE SO

00:18:16.695 --> 00:18:18.897
NOW DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND AS

00:18:18.964 --> 00:18:20.232
WE MOVE HOPEFULLY INTO THE POST

00:18:20.299 --> 00:18:23.035
PANDEMIC ERA. ARE YOU ABLE IS

00:18:23.101 --> 00:18:25.204
THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:27.840
STRUCTURE AND SYSTEM. ABLE TO

00:18:27.906 --> 00:18:29.975
DETERMINE WHAT PERCENTAGE. OF

00:18:30.042 --> 00:18:31.610
PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH OUR

00:18:31.677 --> 00:18:33.879
TRAINING PIPELINE. ACTUALLY

00:18:33.946 --> 00:18:36.815
SECURE A JOB IN THE FIELD FOR

00:18:36.882 --> 00:18:39.451
WHICH THEY RECEIVE TRAINING. NOT

00:18:39.518 --> 00:18:41.687
NOT AUTOMATICALLY THE WAY THAT

00:18:41.753 --> 00:18:43.188
WE GET IT THAT IS TO THE

00:18:43.255 --> 00:18:44.923
SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTS- THAT COME

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:46.525
FROM OUR OUR PROJECTS WE SPENT A

00:18:46.592 --> 00:18:48.293
LOT OF TIME- COMMUNICATING WITH

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.328
PROJECTS DOING COMMUNITIES OF

00:18:49.394 --> 00:18:50.729
PRACTICE AND THAT SORT OF THING

00:18:50.796 --> 00:18:53.332
VERY HANDS ON- BUT NO THERE'S NO

00:18:53.398 --> 00:18:54.800
I KNOW WHATYOU'RE ASKING AND I

00:18:54.867 --> 00:18:56.568
DON'T THERE'S NO AUTOMATED WAY

00:18:56.635 --> 00:18:58.937
TO GET THAT DATA- DO WE DON'T WE

00:18:59.004 --> 00:19:00.906
DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S 50% I'M

00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:02.207
NOT BEING CRITICAL I'M JUST.

00:19:02.274 --> 00:19:04.510
TRYING TO BRING THE PROBLEM. WE

00:19:04.576 --> 00:19:06.245
DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S 50% OF

00:19:06.311 --> 00:19:07.613
THOSE WHO WERE TRAINED AT SECURE

00:19:07.679 --> 00:19:08.747
EMPLOYMENT IN THE FIELDS WHICH

00:19:08.814 --> 00:19:10.949
ARE TRAINED OR WHETHER IT'S 70%

00:19:11.016 --> 00:19:13.619
OR- EIGHTY WITH ANY DEGREE OF

00:19:13.685 --> 00:19:17.189
CERTAINTY I GUESS THAT WE COULD

00:19:17.256 --> 00:19:17.823
TAKE. TO THE BANK SO TO SPEAK.

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:19.791
WE CAN TELL YOU THAT- WE CAN

00:19:19.858 --> 00:19:22.094
TELL YOU- BY LOOKING AT THE DATA

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.228
COMES FROM CAL JOBS AND

00:19:23.295 --> 00:19:24.763
COMPARING IT AGAINST THE BASE

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:27.065
WAGE FILE- AND WE CAN LOOK AT-

00:19:27.132 --> 00:19:29.601
PRE. PRE PLACEMENT DATA. PRE

00:19:29.668 --> 00:19:31.436
PROGRAMMED DATA RATHER AND THEN

00:19:31.503 --> 00:19:33.272
POST OP PROGRAM DATA AND WE CAN

00:19:33.338 --> 00:19:35.307
LOOK AT QUARTERS OUT- AND TELL

00:19:35.374 --> 00:19:37.109
YOU- WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE

00:19:37.175 --> 00:19:38.944
TRAINEES. ACTUALLY GOT

00:19:39.011 --> 00:19:39.611
EMPLOYMENT WE CAN TELL YOU THEIR

00:19:39.678 --> 00:19:42.147
WAGES- BUT WE CAN'T TELL YOU IS

00:19:42.214 --> 00:19:44.716
WHAT SPECIFICALLY- THAT JOB IS

00:19:44.783 --> 00:19:46.885
OR WHAT THAT OCCUPATION IS- AND

00:19:46.952 --> 00:19:47.986
I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

00:19:48.053 --> 00:19:49.388
THAT MAYBE THAT THE- OTHER FOLKS

00:19:49.454 --> 00:19:50.989
ON THE CALL CAN ADDRESS. BUT THE

00:19:51.056 --> 00:19:52.124
OTHER THING WE CAN TELL YOU IS

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:55.193
THAT- THE BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:57.863
THAT TRAINING. IS IT COMPARED TO

00:19:57.930 --> 00:19:59.331
OTHER KINDS OF INTERVENTIONS OR

00:19:59.398 --> 00:20:02.968
SERVICES TRAINING AT. GET YOU. A

00:20:03.035 --> 00:20:04.870
LOT GREATER OUTCOME IN TERMS OF

00:20:04.937 --> 00:20:06.371
JOB PLACEMENT AND QUALITY JOB

00:20:06.438 --> 00:20:07.839
PLACEMENT THEN YOU THEN YOU.

00:20:07.906 --> 00:20:08.907
OTHERWISE WOULD WITHOUT

00:20:08.974 --> 00:20:10.976
TRAINING. AND I THINK IT'S- IT

00:20:11.043 --> 00:20:12.744
MAY BE TALKING TO ADDRESS THIS

00:20:12.811 --> 00:20:14.680
R. CAL SKILLS WORK. THAT WAS

00:20:14.746 --> 00:20:16.582
ANALYZED BY DO YOU SEE POLICY

00:20:16.648 --> 00:20:19.418
LAB FOUND THAT. AS MUCH AS OTHER

00:20:19.484 --> 00:20:22.354
30% GAIN IN TERMS OF WAGES FOR

00:20:22.421 --> 00:20:22.888
PEOPLE WENT TO TRAINING AS

00:20:22.955 --> 00:20:23.689
OPPOSED TO PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T.

00:20:23.755 --> 00:20:25.023
BOB I THINK THAT TRAINING WAS

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:26.124
ALWAYS WRAPPED WITH OTHER KINDS

00:20:26.191 --> 00:20:28.193
OF SERVICES. I'M SURE I'M JUST

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:30.929
CONCERNED. FOR EXAMPLE WE DON'T

00:20:30.996 --> 00:20:33.665
KNOW. IF THE DENTAL HYGIENIST

00:20:33.732 --> 00:20:37.936
WHO WENT THROUGH. ONE OF OUR JOB

00:20:38.003 --> 00:20:38.537
TRAINING PROGRAMS. IN AN AREA

00:20:38.604 --> 00:20:39.605
THAT HAPPENS TO HAVE A LOT OF

00:20:39.671 --> 00:20:42.507
DENTAL HYGIENISTS. WOUND UP AT

00:20:42.574 --> 00:20:45.210
STARBUCKS. WITH THE WAGES

00:20:45.277 --> 00:20:46.111
THEY'RE NOW PAYING IN THE

00:20:46.178 --> 00:20:48.680
BENEFITS WE CAN'T REALLY TELL

00:20:48.747 --> 00:20:51.183
WHETHER THERE'S ANY REASONABLE

00:20:51.249 --> 00:20:53.051
CORRELATION BETWEEN THE TRAINING

00:20:53.118 --> 00:20:54.920
THAT THE INDIVIDUAL RECEIVED AND

00:20:54.987 --> 00:20:56.154
THE JOB SKILLS THAT THEY'RE

00:20:56.221 --> 00:20:57.756
ACTUALLY PERFORMING ALL WE KNOW

00:20:57.823 --> 00:20:59.758
IS THAT THE PAY OR THE PAY RATE

00:20:59.825 --> 00:21:02.227
SEEMS TO BE ABOUT RIGHT FOR THE

00:21:02.294 --> 00:21:03.295
TRAINING PROGRAM THAT THEY WENT

00:21:03.362 --> 00:21:06.231
THROUGH THAT. FIRST STATEMENT

00:21:06.298 --> 00:21:09.101
YEAH THAT'S THAT THEY'RE NOT-

00:21:09.167 --> 00:21:11.103
AND I EXPECT THINK THAT I MEAN

00:21:11.169 --> 00:21:13.505
THERE IS THERE IS SOME LEVEL OF

00:21:13.572 --> 00:21:15.073
KNOWLEDGE WE GAIN FROM THE DATA

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:16.975
ON WHAT SECTORS- PEOPLE WENT TO

00:21:17.042 --> 00:21:18.977
WORK AND- BUT I THINK YOU IT

00:21:19.044 --> 00:21:20.479
DOESN'T GET TO THE LEVEL OF

00:21:20.545 --> 00:21:24.816
GRANULARITY THAT THAT THAT THAT

00:21:24.883 --> 00:21:25.417
I THINK THAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR

00:21:25.484 --> 00:21:26.018
THAT YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT. WELL

00:21:26.084 --> 00:21:28.320

00:28:58.903 --> 00:29:00.505
TRYING TO GET INTO HOW WE USE

00:29:00.572 --> 00:29:01.139
THEM OVER PERFORMANCE

00:29:01.206 --> 00:29:03.608
INFORMATION- AND WE ALSO LOOK AT

00:29:03.675 --> 00:29:05.543
PAST PERFORMANCE TO DRIVE POLICY

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:07.645
DECISIONS- AND WHICH POPULATIONS

00:29:07.712 --> 00:29:09.714
TO CIRCLE SOME OF OUR

00:29:09.781 --> 00:29:11.549
DISCRETIONARY FUNDS AS WELL. AND

00:29:11.616 --> 00:29:15.787
THEN I THAT'S IT FOR MY PORTION-

00:29:15.854 --> 00:29:18.289
AND THEN FOR THE BASE WAGE AND I

00:29:18.356 --> 00:29:18.857
WAS GOING TO KICK IT OVER TO

00:29:18.923 --> 00:29:21.092
PAMELA. BUT SENATOR I DON'T SEE

00:29:21.159 --> 00:29:22.827
ANY QUESTIONS FOR ME BEFORE THAT

00:29:22.894 --> 00:29:24.863
OR YOU WANT TO PAMELA JUST. LET

00:29:24.929 --> 00:29:26.731
ME TRY TO PHRASE QUESTIONS I'VE

00:29:26.798 --> 00:29:28.133
BEEN SUCH A LONG TIME SINCE I'VE

00:29:28.199 --> 00:29:30.135
BEEN A LAWYER I DO'T KNOW THAT

00:29:30.201 --> 00:29:31.669
I KNOW WHAT I ASK ON ANYMORE BUT-

00:29:31.736 --> 00:29:33.571
I'M- IN GOOD COMPANY I'M IN

00:29:33.638 --> 00:29:37.542
SACRAMENTO- DO WE KNOW FOR

00:29:37.609 --> 00:29:39.410
EXAMPLE WHEN YOU HAVE GRADUATES

00:29:39.477 --> 00:29:42.347
FROM. INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE

00:29:42.413 --> 00:29:44.549
COMPLETED TRAINING PROGRAMS. AND

00:29:44.616 --> 00:29:46.518
YOU LOOK AT THE DATA THAT YOU

00:29:46.584 --> 00:29:49.387
CURRENTLY COMPILE. CAN YOU LOOK

00:29:49.454 --> 00:29:51.556

00:29:51.623 --> 00:29:53.124
YOU MENTIONED YOU CAN EARNINGS

00:29:53.191 --> 00:29:54.826
INCREASE YOU CAN MEASURE THAT DO

00:29:54.893 --> 00:29:56.561
WE KNOW WHETHER THIS EARNINGS

00:29:56.628 --> 00:29:58.496
INCREASE IS THE RESULT OF A NEW

00:29:58.563 --> 00:30:00.331
JOB IN A FIELD FOR WHICH THE

00:30:00.398 --> 00:30:02.433
EMPLOYEE RECEIVED TRAINING OR

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:04.769
WHETHER IT'S IN A- THE EMPLOYEE

00:30:04.836 --> 00:30:06.871
SIMPLY STAYED IN THE GENERAL.

00:30:06.938 --> 00:30:08.540
FIELD OF WORK AND RECEIVE

00:30:08.606 --> 00:30:13.711
PROMOTIONS. SO WE- WE WOULD NOT

OCCUPATION CODE WHEN. STOCK FOR

ABLE TO GET THAT INFORMATION

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:24.522
FROM THE PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS SO

00:30:24.589 --> 00:30:25.456
WE WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE IT AND

00:30:25.523 --> 00:30:27.091
THOSE INSTANCES OF BUT IF WE

00:30:27.158 --> 00:30:28.993

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:31.029
AT INDUSTRIES THING IF THERE

00:30:31.095 --> 00:30:33.131
ISN'T AN INDUSTRY CHANGE FOR THE

00:30:33.198 --> 00:30:35.500
INDIVIDUAL- BEFORE AND AFTER THE

00:30:35.567 --> 00:30:38.536
PROGRAM- BUT IT ALL KIND OF

00:30:38.603 --> 00:30:39.904
DEPENDS CASE BY CASE AND IT'S

00:30:39.971 --> 00:30:40.672
NOT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN

00:30:40.738 --> 00:30:42.540
BLANKET ACROSS THE BOARD SAY YES

00:30:42.607 --> 00:30:44.342

AN OVERALL EARNINGS INCREASE.

00:31:44.836 --> 00:31:46.638
ALBEIT IN THE SAME INDUSTRY.

00:31:46.704 --> 00:31:48.539
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO TELL

00:31:48.606 --> 00:31:50.708

A COMPUTERIZED INVENTORY CONTROL

00:31:53.411 --> 00:31:55.713
CLERK RIGHT. THAT'S CORRECT. FOR

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:57.715
ME ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT KEPT

00:31:57.782 --> 00:31:59.717
THE CROPS UP THEN IS HOW WE

00:31:59.784 --> 00:32:01.586
EVALUATE OUR TRAINING PROGRAMS

00:32:01.653 --> 00:32:04.722
SO. ARE THERE ANY CONSEQUENCES

00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:06.457
FOR TRAINING PROGRAMS IT WAS

00:32:06.524 --> 00:32:08.626
RECEIVED THE FUNDS. OUR

00:32:08.693 --> 00:32:10.228
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FUNDS YOU

00:32:10.295 --> 00:32:11.829
KNOW THE PASS I THINK LARGELY

00:32:11.896 --> 00:32:13.264
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:32:13.331 --> 00:32:16.034
ALTHOUGH I THINK TIME AND TIME

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:17.068
IN THE STATE WE- KICK IN MONEY.

00:32:17.135 --> 00:32:18.770
ARE THERE ANY CONSEQUENCES FOR

00:32:18.836 --> 00:32:21.439
THESE PROGRAMS THAT. DON'T HAVE

00:32:21.506 --> 00:32:24.409
A VERY HIGH. A PERCENTAGE OF

00:32:24.475 --> 00:32:26.477
PLACING PEOPLE IN JOBS FOR WHICH

00:32:26.544 --> 00:32:28.846
THEY- RECEIVE MONEY AND PROVIDED

00:32:28.913 --> 00:32:32.150
TRAINING. YEAH I STILL FOR OUR

00:32:32.216 --> 00:32:34.052
PROGRAMS AS I MENTIONED WE THE

00:32:34.118 --> 00:32:36.387
MAJORITY OF OUR FUNDS- YOU'RE

00:32:36.454 --> 00:32:37.889
REQUIRED TO USE A PROVIDER

00:32:37.955 --> 00:32:39.190
THAT'S LISTED ON THE OLD WILL

00:32:39.257 --> 00:32:41.459
TRAINING PROVIDER LIST- AND PART

00:32:41.526 --> 00:32:43.227
OF BEING ON THAT LIST IS

00:32:43.294 --> 00:32:45.763
ANNUALLY WE EVALUATE WHAT.

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:47.732
PERFORMANCE LOOKS LIKE FOR THAT

00:32:47.799 --> 00:32:49.967
PROGRAM- AND IF THE PERFORMANCE

00:32:50.034 --> 00:32:52.837
FALLS BELOW OUR EXPECTATIONS

00:32:52.904 --> 00:32:53.905
THEN WE ALL WILL REMOVE THAT

00:32:53.971 --> 00:32:55.773
PROVIDER FROM THE LIST OR NOT

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:57.075
PROGRAM FROM THE LIST I SHOULD

00:32:57.141 --> 00:32:59.744
SAY- AND THEN GIVE THE LOCAL

00:32:59.811 --> 00:33:02.080
AREAS CAN'T USE THAT PROGRAM

00:33:02.146 --> 00:33:03.614
ANYMORE SO THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE

00:33:03.681 --> 00:33:05.883
TO CONTINUE RECEIVING- ARE

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:07.985
FEDERAL FUNDS FOR TRAINING. BUT

00:33:08.052 --> 00:33:09.754
YOU'RE LIMITED TO THE DATA THAT

00:33:09.821 --> 00:33:13.858
YOU HAVE AGAINST. WHICH TO

00:33:13.925 --> 00:33:14.492
MEASURE PERFORMANCE RIGHT. YES

00:33:14.559 --> 00:33:16.794
THAT'S CORRECT SO YOU WOULDN'T

00:33:16.861 --> 00:33:18.296
SO I GUESS THE ANSWER TO MY

00:33:18.363 --> 00:33:20.064
QUESTION ON IN TERMS OF

00:33:20.131 --> 00:33:22.066
CONSEQUENCES FOR THOSE TRAINING

00:33:22.133 --> 00:33:24.736

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:27.638
THE TRAINING GET JOBS IN THE

00:33:27.705 --> 00:33:29.107
FIELD FOR WHICH ARE TRAINED.

00:33:29.173 --> 00:33:31.542
THERE'S NO MEANS TO EVALUATE

00:33:31.609 --> 00:33:33.244
THOSE TRAINING PROVIDERS CORRECT.

00:33:33.311 --> 00:33:35.313
THAT'S CORRECT SO WE ARE ONLY

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:37.048
MEASURING THE TRAINING PROVIDERS

00:33:37.115 --> 00:33:40.418

PROJECT KNOWN TO MAN SO I KNOW

00:36:34.492 --> 00:36:36.994
HOW DIFFICULT THEY ARE. BUT HOW

00:36:37.061 --> 00:36:39.163
DIFFICULT WOULD IT BE TO ADD. A

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:42.900
FEW DATA LINES TO. YOUR SYSTEM

00:36:42.967 --> 00:36:45.303

NICOLE'S QUESTION AND IT'S A

00:37:14.599 --> 00:37:15.600
LITTLE BIT FURTHER DOWN IN THE

00:37:15.666 --> 00:37:20.104
PRESENTATION- BUT- IT. THE BASE

00:37:20.171 --> 00:37:21.339
WAGE FILE IS A DATA BASE

00:37:21.405 --> 00:37:23.708
REPOSITORY FOR INFORMATION SO

00:37:23.774 --> 00:37:24.742
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT EXPANDING A

00:37:24.809 --> 00:37:27.812
DATABASE- SO REALLY LOOKING AT

00:37:27.878 --> 00:37:30.014
EXPANDING THE DATABASE IS BASED

00:37:30.081 --> 00:37:31.716
ON WHAT DATA ELEMENTS THAT YOU

00:37:31.782 --> 00:37:34.585
WOULD LIKE- US TO CAPTURE. AND

00:37:34.652 --> 00:37:37.054
THE EMPLOYER'S ABILITY TO- BRING

00:37:37.121 --> 00:37:39.056
THAT INFORMATION FORWARD TO US

00:37:39.123 --> 00:37:40.324
AND HAVING THE FUNDING

00:37:40.391 --> 00:37:41.826
MECHANISMS IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT

00:37:41.892 --> 00:37:43.494
CHANGE SO IN ORDER TO ADDRESS

00:37:43.561 --> 00:37:44.895
YOUR QUESTION THAT WOULD. THAT

00:37:44.962 --> 00:37:46.530
WOULD BE MY ANSWER SO WHAT WE

00:37:46.597 --> 00:37:47.999
WOULD NEED TO HAVE I THINK BUT

00:37:48.065 --> 00:37:49.634
YOU'RE PROBABLY MORE EXPERT THIS

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:51.035
THAN I BUT IT WOULD SEEM TO ME

00:37:51.102 --> 00:37:53.137
IF WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO KNOW.

00:37:53.204 --> 00:37:55.673
IS WHAT THE JOB NEEDS OUR ACTUAL

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:57.108
JOB NEEDS ARE IN A PARTICULAR

00:37:57.174 --> 00:37:58.509
REGION AND WHETHER INDIVIDUALS

00:37:58.576 --> 00:38:00.745
RECEIVE TRAINING AND RECEIVED A

00:38:00.811 --> 00:38:04.315
JOB IN THE FIELD FOR WHICH THEY

00:38:04.382 --> 00:38:05.516
ARE TRAINED. WE WOULD NEED TO

00:38:05.583 --> 00:38:08.519
HAVE A SPECIFIC OCCUPATIONAL.

00:38:08.586 --> 00:38:12.757
DATE OF. N. N. A WAGE RATE WITH

00:38:12.823 --> 00:38:19.063
ME AT A JOB. HAVE TO DEFERRED IN

INFORMATION DIVISION FROM THAT

00:38:21.699 --> 00:38:23.267
BUT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE ITEMS

00:38:23.334 --> 00:38:24.802
THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED TO BE

00:38:24.869 --> 00:38:25.670
ABLE TO MAKE THOSE

00:38:25.736 --> 00:38:27.638
DETERMINATIONS CURRENTLY THE

00:38:27.705 --> 00:38:28.773
BASE WAGE FILE INFORMATION

00:38:28.839 --> 00:38:30.741
THAT'S REPORTED TO US INCLUDES

00:38:30.808 --> 00:38:31.709
THE EMPLOYEES SOCIAL SECURITY

00:38:31.776 --> 00:38:33.978
NUMBER THEIR NAME WHICH IS FIRST

00:38:34.045 --> 00:38:36.013
MIDDLE INITIAL AND LAST THE

TOTAL SUBJECT WAGES. WAGES IN

00:38:38.549 --> 00:38:40.618
THE PET WITHHELD SO THAT'S

00:38:40.685 --> 00:38:41.752
CURRENTLY WHAT EMPLOYERS ARE

00:38:41.819 --> 00:38:43.421
REPORTING TO US RIGHT NOW WE

00:38:43.487 --> 00:38:45.356
COLLECT THAT FROM THE- EMPLOYERS

00:38:45.423 --> 00:38:46.590
IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THE

00:38:46.657 --> 00:38:47.725
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE

00:38:47.792 --> 00:38:49.360
DISABILITY INSURANCE PAID FAMILY

LEAVE THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX

00:38:50.828 --> 00:38:53.898
PROGRAMS AND BASICALLY IT'S A

00:38:53.964 --> 00:38:55.366
DATABASE REPOSITORY WHERE THE

00:38:55.433 --> 00:38:57.368
WAGES THAT INFORMATION IS

00:38:57.435 --> 00:38:58.903
MAINTAINED AND TO GIVE YOU AN

00:38:58.969 --> 00:39:00.805
IDEA OF THE QUANTITY OF THE DATA

00:39:00.871 --> 00:39:02.873
THAT WE RECEIVE IN THIS AREA WE

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:04.175
HAVE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION

00:39:04.241 --> 00:39:05.509
EMPLOYERS AND THEY REPORT AN

00:39:05.576 --> 00:39:07.178
AVERAGE OF TWENTY FIVE MILLION

00:39:07.244 --> 00:39:11.816
WAGE LINES EACH QUARTER. BUT IT

00:39:11.882 --> 00:39:12.316
IS IT MOSTLY ELECTRONIC

00:39:12.383 --> 00:39:13.951
REPORTING. I NINE POINT 9% IS

00:39:14.018 --> 00:39:15.953
ELECTRONIC REPORTING WHICH WOULD

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:18.122
WHICH IS WHICH SHOULD EASE THE

00:39:18.189 --> 00:39:19.657
WORKLOAD A LITTLE BIT FOR.

00:39:19.724 --> 00:39:22.393
EVERYONE I WOULD THINK- WE'VE

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:24.195
BEEN PHENOMENALLY SUCCESSFUL AND

00:39:24.261 --> 00:39:26.864
HAVING- ELECTRONIC REPORTING

00:39:26.931 --> 00:39:28.866
SYSTEM WE HAVE MULTIPLE CHANNELS

00:39:28.933 --> 00:39:30.167
AVAILABLE TO THE EMPLOYER TO

00:39:30.234 --> 00:39:33.871
REPORT TO US- VIA- AN ONLINE

00:39:33.938 --> 00:39:35.606
SYSTEM WE ALSO DO BULK FILE

00:39:35.673 --> 00:39:37.975
TRANSFERS AND- WE HAVE A VERY

00:39:38.042 --> 00:39:40.177
SMALL PAPER PROCESSING- FOR TAX

00:39:40.244 --> 00:39:43.047
INFORMATION- I'M STILL ON GOING.

00:39:43.114 --> 00:39:44.715
ON ONE OF MY THOUGHTS IS THE

00:39:44.782 --> 00:39:46.650
AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE PROCESS

00:39:46.717 --> 00:39:48.352
THROUGH THE PIPELINE FOR.

00:39:48.419 --> 00:39:51.322
TRAINING JOB TRAINING AND JOB

00:39:51.388 --> 00:39:53.824
RETRAINING- IS SIGNIFICANT AND I

00:39:53.891 --> 00:39:55.092
DON'T KNOW I MEAN IT'S CERTAINLY

00:39:55.159 --> 00:39:56.460
IN THE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF

00:39:56.527 --> 00:39:58.195
DOLLARS IT MAY BE MUCH MORE THAN

00:39:58.262 --> 00:39:59.764
THAT YOU ALL WOULD KNOW THAT.

00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:01.499
AND THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT

00:40:01.565 --> 00:40:04.702
FOLKS WOULD KNOW THAT. BUT THE

00:40:04.769 --> 00:40:07.872
SAVINGS IN CUTTING OUT THE

00:40:07.938 --> 00:40:10.975
WASTED TRAINING TO MAKE SURE THE

00:40:11.041 --> 00:40:13.310
TRAINING IS ACTUALLY DELIVERED

00:40:13.377 --> 00:40:15.846
TO PEOPLE WHO NEED TRAINING FOR

00:40:15.913 --> 00:40:18.816
JOBS THAT ACTUALLY EXIST. MY

00:40:18.883 --> 00:40:21.352
UNINFORMED GREATLY UNINFORMED

00:40:21.418 --> 00:40:23.721
BRAIN TELLS ME WOULD PROBABLY

00:40:23.788 --> 00:40:27.525
PAY. CERTAINLY OVER THE LONG RUN

00:40:27.591 --> 00:40:29.059
FOR ANY MODIFICATIONS THAT WE

00:40:29.126 --> 00:40:31.228
NEED TO MAKE TO THE DATA SYSTEM

00:40:31.295 --> 00:40:33.564
IN ORDER TO COLLECT THE DATA. TO

00:40:33.631 --> 00:40:36.133
DETERMINE JOB NEEDS AND JOB

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:39.503
MATCH YES IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT I

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:40.504
DON'T I DON'T I'M NOT ASKING YOU

00:40:40.571 --> 00:40:44.275
TO. YOU KNOW. THIS IS NOT GONNA

00:40:44.341 --> 00:40:46.343
GOTCHA BUT I DID JUST MY THOUGHT

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:48.712
THAT THERE MIGHT BE IF WE CAN'T

00:40:48.779 --> 00:40:51.081
TELL WHETHER THE TRAINING THAT

00:40:51.148 --> 00:40:52.650
WE'RE PROVIDING TO EMPLOYEES

00:40:52.716 --> 00:40:55.052
RESULTS IN A JOB IN THAT FIELD

00:40:55.119 --> 00:40:56.187
FOR WHICH WE ARE PROVIDING THE

00:40:56.253 --> 00:40:58.389
TRAINING AN EMPLOYEE HAS TO GO

00:40:58.455 --> 00:41:00.958
DO SOMETHING ELSE THEN THERE

00:41:01.025 --> 00:41:01.926
SHOULD BE A VALUE ATTACHED TO

00:41:01.992 --> 00:41:05.663
THAT THAT COULD BE SAVED IF WE

00:41:05.729 --> 00:41:06.263
COULD ACTUALLY MAKE THE LINES

00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:09.700
CONNECT. AND I WANT TO WORK WITH

00:41:09.767 --> 00:41:16.273
YOU ON THAT. I DON'T- I DON'T

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:18.108
THINK I HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ANY

00:41:18.175 --> 00:41:20.077
OTHER QUESTIONS MAN DO I MISS

00:41:20.144 --> 00:41:21.879
ANYTHING. DO YOU WANT ME TO GO

00:41:21.946 --> 00:41:22.746
THROUGH THE REST OF THE

00:41:22.813 --> 00:41:23.914
QUESTIONS THAT YOU SUBMITTED

00:41:23.981 --> 00:41:25.282
ABOUT WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR

00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:26.717
RESEARCH FOR OTHER STATES YES

00:41:26.784 --> 00:41:29.253
MA'AM THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL- YOU

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.689
DID ASK- US TO COMPARE BASE

00:41:31.755 --> 00:41:33.090
WHICH DATABASE TO WHAT WAS DONE

00:41:33.157 --> 00:41:34.725
IN OTHER STATES. WE'RE NOT

00:41:34.792 --> 00:41:36.560
EXPERTS IN WHAT THE OTHER STATES

00:41:36.627 --> 00:41:37.561
TOO SO WE WENT OUT AND DID A

00:41:37.628 --> 00:41:38.896
LITTLE BIT OF RESEARCH- WE

00:41:38.963 --> 00:41:39.897
LOOKED AT THE THREE LARGEST

00:41:39.964 --> 00:41:41.665
STATES- WHICH CALIFORNIA IS BY

00:41:41.732 --> 00:41:43.968
FAR THE LARGEST BUT WE ALSO-

00:41:44.034 --> 00:41:45.102
LOOKED AT NEW YORK FLORIDA AND

00:41:45.169 --> 00:41:46.604
TEXAS AND THEN WE LOOK AT THE

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:47.705
STREET THREE STATES THAT ARE

00:41:47.771 --> 00:41:49.139
CLOSEST TO CALIFORNIA OREGON

00:41:49.206 --> 00:41:51.609
NEVADA AND ARIZONA. AND WE FOUND

00:41:51.675 --> 00:41:54.511
THAT- FOR THE MOST PART THE DATA

00:41:54.578 --> 00:41:55.913
COLLECTED BY THESE STATES IS THE

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:58.215
SAME AS THE DATA ELEMENTS EDT

00:41:58.282 --> 00:41:59.984
COLLECTS WITH ONE EXCEPTION-

00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:00.951
WHICH WAS OREGON AND THEY

00:42:01.018 --> 00:42:02.553
COLLECT THE NUMBER OF HOURS

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:03.921
WORKED FOR EACH EMPLOYEE. THEN

00:42:03.988 --> 00:42:06.724
WE WENT OUT- AND LOOKED AT A

00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:08.893
VARIETY OF OTHER STATES- WHAT

00:42:08.959 --> 00:42:11.595
DATA THEY WERE COLLECTING. AND

00:42:11.662 --> 00:42:12.329
SOME OF THE STATES THAT WE

00:42:12.396 --> 00:42:14.031
LOOKED AT WERE ALASKA INDIANA

00:42:14.098 --> 00:42:16.734
IOWA REALLY STATES THAT HAD-

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:17.201
QUITE A BIT OF PUBLIC

00:42:17.268 --> 00:42:18.969
INFORMATION OUT THERE AND BASED

00:42:19.036 --> 00:42:20.671
ON OUR LIMITED RESEARCH THERE

00:42:20.738 --> 00:42:21.372
WAS QUITE A BIT OF VARIANCE

00:42:21.438 --> 00:42:22.840
BETWEEN THE DATA ELEMENTS OF THE

00:42:22.907 --> 00:42:24.575
OTHER STATES COLLECTED. RANGING

00:42:24.642 --> 00:42:26.343
FROM HOURS AND WEEKS WORK TO THE

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:28.178
STANDARD OCCUPATIONAL CODE AND

00:42:28.245 --> 00:42:29.546
WHETHER AND THERE'S ALSO A

00:42:29.613 --> 00:42:31.048
VARIANCE AND WHETHER THE DATA IS

00:42:31.115 --> 00:42:32.983
MANDATORY OR VOLUNTARY FOR THE

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:34.985
EMPLOYER TO REPORT IT. SO WE

00:42:35.052 --> 00:42:36.754
FOUND FIVE STATES THE COLLECTED

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:39.123
HOURS WORKED FOR HAD WEEKS WORK-

00:42:39.189 --> 00:42:40.824
THREE STATES DID ASK FOR THE

00:42:40.891 --> 00:42:42.092
STANDARD OCCUPATIONAL CODE ENTRY

00:42:42.159 --> 00:42:45.162
STATES WANTED WORK LOCATION- BUT

00:42:45.229 --> 00:42:47.097
INTO THE STATES IT WAS VOLUNTARY

00:42:47.164 --> 00:42:53.304
AS OPPOSED TO- MANDATORY. DATA

00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:54.171
COLLECTION- THERE WAS ALSO QUITE

00:42:54.238 --> 00:42:56.407
AROUND- WHAT IT JUST ALL TYPES

00:42:56.473 --> 00:42:57.808
OF DATA INCLUDING DATA ON

00:42:57.875 --> 00:42:59.343
EMPLOYEE OCCUPATION COULD BE

00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:00.144
COLLECTED THROUGH THE BASE WHICH

00:43:00.210 --> 00:43:02.212
FILE AND I THINK I DRESS THAT

00:43:02.279 --> 00:43:04.415
EARLIER BUT THE DATA THAT COULD

00:43:04.481 --> 00:43:05.449
BE COLLECTED THROUGH THE BASE

00:43:05.516 --> 00:43:07.251
WAGE FILE WOULD BE DEPENDENT ON

00:43:07.318 --> 00:43:08.719
LEGISLATION AND WHAT WAS

00:43:08.786 --> 00:43:10.187
MANDATED TO BE REPORTED BY THE

00:43:10.254 --> 00:43:12.890
EMPLOYERS- EDIE'S CAPACITY TO

00:43:12.957 --> 00:43:14.425
RESTRUCTURE THE EMPLOYER'S

00:43:14.491 --> 00:43:17.227
REPORT- AND FOR THE EMPLOYERS TO

00:43:17.294 --> 00:43:18.395
COMPLY WITH THOSE ADDITIONAL

00:43:18.462 --> 00:43:20.130
DATA ELEMENTS AND THEN THE

00:43:20.197 --> 00:43:22.232
EMPLOYER'S ABILITY TO COMPLY. SO

00:43:22.299 --> 00:43:23.600
THOSE ARE REALLY THE THINGS

00:43:23.667 --> 00:43:25.035
THREE THINGS THAT WE LOOK AT

00:43:25.102 --> 00:43:26.136
WHEN MAKING ANY LEGISLATIVE

MULTIPLE TIMES DEPENDING ON WHAT

00:43:51.562 --> 00:43:52.563
THE ASK WAS FROM THE LEGISLATURE.

WAGE DATABASE IS A REPOSITORY

00:45:42.806 --> 00:45:45.943
THAT THEY TIE INTO BUT IS NOT

SPECIFICALLY IN THAT. PROJECT. I

00:45:54.084 --> 00:45:55.219
DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN ANSWER

THIS BUT- IF WE WERE TO PURSUE-

00:45:59.256 --> 00:46:01.925
A LEGISLATIVE EFFORT TO EXPAND

00:46:01.992 --> 00:46:04.194
THE WHAT I CALL LITTLE LABOR

00:46:04.261 --> 00:46:05.629
MARKET INFORMATION SYSTEM I

00:46:05.696 --> 00:46:07.364
GUESS YOU WOULD CALL THE BASE

DATA POINTS BUT BUT DATA POINTS

00:46:15.205 --> 00:46:16.673
THAT WILL AT LEAST GIVE US THE

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:18.509
ABILITY TO MEASURE. THE

00:46:18.575 --> 00:46:20.244

TERMS OF RETRAINING. OF. HOW HOW

00:46:29.386 --> 00:46:31.889
MUCH LEAD TIME WITH THE EDT

00:46:31.955 --> 00:46:33.690
REQUIRE FOR THAT SORT OF

00:46:33.757 --> 00:46:36.527
LEGISLATION TO TAKE EFFECT IN

00:46:36.593 --> 00:46:38.362
ORDER TO GIVE YOU THE TIME TO.

DESIGNED AS YOU'RE MOVING

00:46:42.232 --> 00:46:43.867
THROUGH YOUR OTHER I. T.

00:46:43.934 --> 00:46:46.670
MODERNIZATION PROGRAMS. I WOULD

00:46:46.737 --> 00:46:48.639
DEFER THAT QUESTION TORE

00:46:48.705 --> 00:46:50.107
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOLKS AND

00:46:50.174 --> 00:46:51.608
WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO GET BACK TO

00:46:51.675 --> 00:46:53.043
YOU IT DOES HAVE A PROGRAM

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:55.112
COMPONENT THAT I CAN SPEAK TO

00:46:55.179 --> 00:46:56.480
WHEN WE WENT TO ELECTRONIC

00:46:56.547 --> 00:46:57.581
REPORTING WHICH WAS REALLY

00:46:57.648 --> 00:46:58.715
MOVING OUR EMPLOYERS OFF OF

00:46:58.782 --> 00:47:00.851
PAPER WE TOOK A TWO AND A HALF

00:47:00.918 --> 00:47:02.953
YOUR LEAD TIME AND THAT WAS FOR

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:04.488
MARKETING AND OUTREACH IT WAS

00:47:04.555 --> 00:47:06.423
ALSO TO ALLOW EMPLOYERS TIME TO

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:07.724
MODIFY THEIR SYSTEMS TO

00:47:07.791 --> 00:47:09.359
ACCOMMODATE ELECTRONIC REPORTING

00:47:09.426 --> 00:47:10.961
SH AND A LOT OF THE SAME

00:47:11.028 --> 00:47:13.597
CONSIDERATIONS ARE AT PLAY HERE-

00:47:13.664 --> 00:47:14.798
WE WOULD NEED TO REPROGRAM OUR

00:47:14.865 --> 00:47:16.867
LEGACY SYSTEMS. MODIFY EXISTING

00:47:16.934 --> 00:47:18.802
DATABASES REPORTING STRUCTURES

00:47:18.869 --> 00:47:19.703
WE WOULD NEED TO ESTABLISH

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:20.737
TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND

00:47:20.804 --> 00:47:23.874
MAINTENANCE AND LOOK AT DATA

00:47:23.941 --> 00:47:26.009
STORAGE. SO INTERNALLY WE HAVE

00:47:26.076 --> 00:47:26.843
TO DEVELOP A MARKETING AND

00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:28.178
OUTREACH PLAN TO LET EMPLOYERS

00:47:28.245 --> 00:47:30.981
KNOW- WHAT THE NEW REQUIREMENTS

00:47:31.048 --> 00:47:32.115
WERE AND WE WOULD HAVE TO TRAIN

00:47:32.182 --> 00:47:33.450
OUR STAFF IN ORDER TO SUPPORT

00:47:33.517 --> 00:47:35.385
EMPLOYERS IN THIS NEW EFFORT.

00:47:35.452 --> 00:47:37.688
FROM THE EMPLOYER SIDE- THERE

00:47:37.754 --> 00:47:39.189
WOULD BE ADDITIONAL COST YOU

00:47:39.256 --> 00:47:40.624
PROBABLY CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES

00:47:40.691 --> 00:47:42.159
REPORT THE DATA ELEMENTS AND

00:47:42.226 --> 00:47:43.927
THEY WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO.

00:47:43.994 --> 00:47:45.229
RESTRUCTURE AND MODIFY THEIR

00:47:45.295 --> 00:47:46.964
INTERNAL- PAYROLL REPORTING

00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:49.766
SYSTEMS AND THEN RELATED TO THAT

00:47:49.833 --> 00:47:51.702
WE ALSO HAVE PAYROLL AGENTS AND

00:47:51.768 --> 00:47:53.136
SOFTWARE VENDORS WHO SUPPLY

00:47:53.203 --> 00:47:56.440
PAYROLL REPORTING- TECHNOLOGY

00:47:56.506 --> 00:47:57.741
AND THEY WOULD ALSO NEED LATE

00:47:57.808 --> 00:48:00.244
LEAD TIME. WE'D ALSO PROBABLY

00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:04.948
NEED TO LOOK AT SOME GOOD- TOP

00:48:05.015 --> 00:48:07.517
NOTCH- MARKETING AND OUTREACH

00:48:07.584 --> 00:48:08.986
MATERIALS TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:48:09.052 --> 00:48:10.120
EMPLOYERS KNEW WHAT THEY WERE

00:48:10.187 --> 00:48:11.421
REPORTING AND THAT THERE WERE

00:48:11.488 --> 00:48:13.056
NOT ANY QUESTIONS- SO WE DIDN'T

00:48:13.123 --> 00:48:14.291
END UP IN THE SAME PLACE WE

00:48:14.358 --> 00:48:15.058
WOULD WANT THEM TO HAVE THE

00:48:15.125 --> 00:48:17.060
INFORMATION THAT THEY NEEDED. TO

00:48:17.127 --> 00:48:18.095
BE ABLE TO REPORT THE

00:48:18.161 --> 00:48:19.396
INFORMATION THAT THE LABOR

00:48:19.463 --> 00:48:21.898
MARKET WAS REQUESTING- WE NEED

00:48:21.965 --> 00:48:24.001
SOME STANDARDIZATION AROUND

00:48:24.067 --> 00:48:26.303
OCCUPATIONAL CODING- WE'VE GOT

00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:28.105
DIFFERENT TYPES OF IN-

00:48:28.171 --> 00:48:30.874
COMPENSATION MODELS- THAT WOULD

00:48:30.941 --> 00:48:33.410
NEED TO BE ADDRESSED- AND THAT

00:48:33.477 --> 00:48:35.912
WOULD TAKE SOME- EXTENSIVE

00:48:35.979 --> 00:48:37.648
MARKETING AND OUTREACH. JUST

00:48:37.714 --> 00:48:39.249
CURIOUS THE TWO AND A HALF YEARS

00:48:39.316 --> 00:48:40.851
THAT YOU PROGRAM FOR THAT

00:48:40.917 --> 00:48:42.252
PARTICULAR THE CHANGE THAT YOU

00:48:42.319 --> 00:48:43.754
REFERRED TO WAS THE TWO AND A

00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:44.755
HALF YEARS ADEQUATE OR DID YOU

00:48:44.821 --> 00:48:46.623
TEND TO. RUN BEYOND THE TWO AND

00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:47.991
A HALF YEARS IN ORDER FOR. THE

00:48:48.058 --> 00:48:50.160
MEDICATION THAT WAS MOSTLY A

00:48:50.227 --> 00:48:52.763
MARKETING AND OUTREACH PLAN- AND

00:48:52.829 --> 00:48:54.765
AGAIN NINETY NINE POINT 9%

00:48:54.831 --> 00:48:55.866
COMPLIANCE AT THE END OF THE TWO

00:48:55.932 --> 00:48:57.501
AND A HALF YEARS. WE HAD A YEAR

00:48:57.567 --> 00:49:00.971
AND A HALF BEFORE WE DID- WE-

00:49:01.038 --> 00:49:02.873
DID IT IN PHASES. SO WE REALLY

00:49:02.939 --> 00:49:03.640
HAD A YEAR AND A HALF OF

00:49:03.707 --> 00:49:04.741
MARKETING AND THEN WE

00:49:04.808 --> 00:49:06.476
IMPLEMENTED FOR LARGE EMPLOYERS

00:49:06.543 --> 00:49:07.611
AND THEN THE SECOND YEAR WE

00:49:07.678 --> 00:49:10.881
IMPLEMENTED FOR SMALL EMPLOYERS

00:49:10.947 --> 00:49:11.415
SO IT GAVE US A TRANSITION

00:49:11.481 --> 00:49:14.318
PERIOD. EXCELLENT WELL YOU KNOW

00:49:14.384 --> 00:49:16.787
PART OF MY CONCERN IS. THE

00:49:16.853 --> 00:49:17.954
EIGHTY D. IS THE ONLY DATA

00:49:18.021 --> 00:49:19.623
REPOSITORY THAT WE ESSENTIALLY

00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:21.525
HAVE AT LEAST THE ONES THAT ARE

00:49:21.591 --> 00:49:22.893
THE DATA REPOSITORY THAT

00:49:22.959 --> 00:49:25.562
SOMEWHAT ACCESSIBLE. AND WITHOUT

00:49:25.629 --> 00:49:27.764
SOME ADDITIONAL DATA FROM THE E.

00:49:27.831 --> 00:49:30.133
D. IT SEEMS TO ME IN THE

00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:32.035
TESTIMONY TODAY SORT OF SUPPORTS

00:49:32.102 --> 00:49:33.203
THIS THAT WE REALLY DON'T HAVE

00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:35.072
AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO EVALUATE OUR

00:49:35.138 --> 00:49:37.074
WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAMS. TO

00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:40.210
GIVE THEM AN A B. C. D. OR F.

00:49:40.277 --> 00:49:41.745
BECAUSE WE CAN'T REALLY TELL

00:49:41.812 --> 00:49:43.113
WHETHER THEY'RE DOING THE JOB

00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:45.315
THAT THEY'VE TOLD THE STUDENT

00:49:45.382 --> 00:49:45.916
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO WITH

00:49:45.982 --> 00:49:47.617
THE TRAINEE. OR THE JOB THAT

00:49:47.684 --> 00:49:48.685
THEY'VE TOLD US THAT THEY'RE

00:49:48.752 --> 00:49:49.820
GOING TO DO IN EXCHANGE FOR THE

00:49:49.886 --> 00:49:51.621
MONEY THAT WE- PROVIDED THROUGH

00:49:51.688 --> 00:49:53.357
GRANTS TO FACILITATE THE

00:49:53.423 --> 00:49:54.858
TRAINING SO WE'LL HAVE TO WORK

00:49:54.925 --> 00:49:56.093
THROUGH THIS SITE LISTEN I

00:49:56.159 --> 00:49:58.228
RECOGNIZED THE BURDEN THAT. THE

00:49:58.295 --> 00:50:00.697
EDT IS UNDER PARTICULARLY NOW

00:50:00.764 --> 00:50:01.998
AND THIS IS PROBABLY NOT THE

00:50:02.065 --> 00:50:03.967
TIME TO ADD MORE TO IT BUT I

00:50:04.034 --> 00:50:05.602
WOULD LIKE TO. HAVE A CONTINUED

00:50:05.669 --> 00:50:07.170
THE CONVERSATION WITH YOU AND

00:50:07.237 --> 00:50:09.373
YOUR COLLEAGUES ON ON HOW WE CAN

00:50:09.439 --> 00:50:12.209
PLAN FORWARD. TO MAYBE ADD SOME

00:50:12.275 --> 00:50:14.277
DATA POINTS TO THE BASE WAGE

00:50:14.344 --> 00:50:16.313
FILE OR WHEREVER IT NEEDS TO GO

00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:18.081
SO THAT WE CAN PERFORM THIS SORT

00:50:18.148 --> 00:50:20.150
OF EVALUATION AND ASSESSMENT. OF

00:50:20.217 --> 00:50:22.652
OUR WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAMS

00:50:22.719 --> 00:50:24.187
BUT- THANK YOU VERY MUCH MA'AM

00:50:24.254 --> 00:50:25.889
YOU'VE BEEN VERY INFORMATIVE.

00:50:25.956 --> 00:50:28.525
DID I FEEL THERE'S SOMETHING-

00:50:28.592 --> 00:50:31.128
YOU DID ASK US- FOR POTENTIAL

GUIDED PATHWAYS AND OTHER

00:54:22.192 --> 00:54:25.228
EFFORTS- AND THEN LASTLY THE

00:54:25.295 --> 00:54:26.630
THIRD COMPONENT THAT WE REALLY

00:54:26.696 --> 00:54:28.198
TRY TO MAINTAIN A FOCUS ON ITS

00:54:28.264 --> 00:54:29.132

TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ALSO

00:54:34.204 --> 00:54:36.306
NOT USING THIS DATA. OR WHAT I

00:54:36.373 --> 00:54:37.607
APPRECIATED HEARING YOUR

IN PROCESS IS NOT. IN OUR STATE.

00:54:54.424 --> 00:54:55.225
AND REALLY MAKE SURE THE WE ARE

00:54:55.291 --> 00:54:57.060
FORWARD AND I'M TRYING TO

00:54:57.127 --> 00:54:58.628
RESOLVE THOSE ISSUES SH I

00:54:58.695 --> 00:55:00.697
SPECIFIC OR THE WORKFORCE DATA

00:55:00.764 --> 00:55:02.899
COMPONENTS- JUST HEARING A

00:55:02.966 --> 00:55:04.034
LITTLE BIT OF THE CONVERSATION

00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:05.635
THAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING THUS FAR

00:55:05.702 --> 00:55:07.003
I WANTED TO HIT ON A COUPLE OF

00:55:07.070 --> 00:55:09.339
KEY POINTS. YOU'VE BEEN NOTING

00:55:09.406 --> 00:55:11.675
THAT- THE CHALLENGE THAT EXISTS

00:55:11.741 --> 00:55:13.510
BETWEEN OUR UNDERSTANDING WHERE

00:55:13.576 --> 00:55:14.811

EFFECTIVELY MEET THOSE NEEDS

00:55:20.383 --> 00:55:22.085
WHAT I WOULD POINT ZERO IS OUR

00:55:22.152 --> 00:55:22.952
CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE

00:55:23.019 --> 00:55:25.622
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE.

00:55:25.689 --> 00:55:26.690
INVESTED IN ACROSS THE STATE OF

00:55:26.756 --> 00:55:28.525
CALIFORNIA THAT'S REALLY FOCUSED

00:55:28.591 --> 00:55:30.326
ON IDENTIFYING AND WORKING WITH

00:55:30.393 --> 00:55:32.128
OUR REGIONAL LABOR MARKET DATA

00:55:32.195 --> 00:55:33.163

WORKFORCE- WITH OUR WORKFORCE

00:55:35.365 --> 00:55:36.966
PARTNERS- AND REALLY TRYING TO

00:55:37.033 --> 00:55:39.069
UNDERSTAND WHO. WHO IS THE

00:55:39.135 --> 00:55:41.037
EMPLOYER BASED- WITHIN THOSE

00:55:41.104 --> 00:55:42.639
COMMUNITIES AND REGIONS WHAT

00:55:42.706 --> 00:55:43.907
DOES THAT LOOK LIKE AND HOW DO

00:55:43.973 --> 00:55:45.241

00:55:52.949 --> 00:55:54.718
WORKFORCE. I SH WHAT I WOULD

00:55:54.784 --> 00:55:57.220
ALSO POINT. IS YOU KNOW A LITTLE

00:55:57.287 --> 00:55:58.755
BIT OF WHAT OUR FIRST SPEAKER

00:55:58.822 --> 00:56:00.724
CAN RAINING NOTED. WHICH IS THAT

00:56:00.790 --> 00:56:02.992
THERE IS DEATH- THERE IS A

00:56:03.059 --> 00:56:04.427
CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THIS THAT

00:56:04.494 --> 00:56:05.929
IS LOCAL BOOTS ON THE GROUND

00:56:05.995 --> 00:56:07.697
PERSON TO PERSON INTERACTION SH

00:56:07.764 --> 00:56:09.632
THE LABOR MARKET DATA TELLS US.

00:56:09.699 --> 00:56:11.401
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WE MIGHT

00:56:11.468 --> 00:56:12.702
FIND WHEN WE LOOK WITHIN THE

00:56:12.769 --> 00:56:14.537
REGION HOWEVER IT'S BY TALKING

00:56:14.604 --> 00:56:16.039
TO INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYERS TO

00:56:16.106 --> 00:56:18.108
UNDERSTAND THE MORE NUANCED.

00:56:18.174 --> 00:56:19.609
SKILLS COMPETENCIES THAT THEY'RE

00:56:19.676 --> 00:56:21.277
LOOKING FOR THE OCCUPATION IS

00:56:21.344 --> 00:56:23.613
THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO. HELP

00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:25.281
THE OTHER PIECE OF THAT ALSO IS

00:56:25.348 --> 00:56:26.649
THAT EVERY STUDENT WHO COMES TO

00:56:26.716 --> 00:56:27.784
US HAS A UNIQUE SET OF

00:56:27.851 --> 00:56:29.853
BACKGROUND EXPERIENCES. AND

00:56:29.919 --> 00:56:31.221
RESUMES AND SO WE ARE

00:56:31.287 --> 00:56:32.956
CONTINUALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

00:56:33.022 --> 00:56:34.858
HOW DO WE ADAPT. OUR

00:56:34.924 --> 00:56:36.726
INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMS WERE JUST

00:56:36.793 --> 00:56:38.461
IN TME TRAINING THAT WILL

00:56:38.528 --> 00:56:40.764
ENABLE INDIVIDUALS TO MOVE OUT

00:56:40.830 --> 00:56:41.631
AND PROGRESS WITHIN THEIR CAREER

00:56:41.698 --> 00:56:44.167
TRAJECTORY. WITHOUT FORCING THEM

00:56:44.234 --> 00:56:45.401
TO REMAIN OUT WITHIN AN

00:56:45.468 --> 00:56:47.003
EDUCATIONAL TRAINING PROGRAM FOR

00:56:47.070 --> 00:56:49.105
LONGER THAN THEY NEED TO. RIGHT

00:56:49.172 --> 00:56:51.407
SO. THAT IT REQUIRES A LITTLE

00:56:51.474 --> 00:56:52.809
BIT MORE NUANCED INTERACTION

00:56:52.876 --> 00:56:54.043
BOTH WITH THE EMPLOYER AT THE

00:56:54.110 --> 00:56:55.745
INDIVIDUAL STUDENT AND THEN WITH

00:56:55.812 --> 00:56:56.613
OUR INSTRUCTIONAL TRAINING

00:56:56.679 --> 00:56:59.649
PROGRAMS- HOWEVER IN ORDER TO

THOSE OCCUPATIONS AND WITHIN

THE- INDUSTRY SECTORS. WE HAVE

00:57:07.657 --> 00:57:08.758
WHAT WE CALL THE C. T. E.

00:57:08.825 --> 00:57:10.660

00:58:40.550 --> 00:58:41.885
CHANGES THAT ARE NEEDED WITHIN

00:58:41.951 --> 00:58:43.987
OUR RESPECTIVE SYSTEMS. FOR THE

00:58:48.358 --> 00:58:50.760
MODALITIES. IN ORDER TO BEST

00:58:50.827 --> 00:58:52.295
MEET THE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS

00:58:52.362 --> 00:58:54.364
GIVEN WHERE OUR CURRENT ECONOMY

00:58:56.699 --> 00:58:57.800
IT ISN'T THE FUTURE OF WORK

00:58:57.867 --> 00:59:00.069
REMOTE WORK IS HERE RIGHT NOW

PROGRAMS TO REGIONAL ECONOMIES

00:59:09.178 --> 00:59:10.747
WHAT WE ALSO HAVE TO TAKE INTO

00:59:10.813 --> 00:59:12.916
ACCOUNT IN THAT PORTFOLIO IS THE

00:59:12.982 --> 00:59:14.250
PERCENTAGE OF INDIVIDUALS WHO

00:59:14.317 --> 00:59:16.586

SOMETHING THAT WE ARE

00:59:22.959 --> 00:59:24.460

NEXT. AROUND EACH FOCUSING COM.

00:59:43.579 --> 00:59:45.348

00:59:45.415 --> 00:59:46.816
WHAT ARE THE UNIQUE SKILL SETS

00:59:46.883 --> 00:59:48.651
THAT I EMPLOYERS ARE ASKING US

00:59:48.718 --> 00:59:49.686

QUALIFICATION I BUT THERE IS A

01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:36.345
POINT TO THE EXAMPLE- IMA HAVE

OCCUPATION IS IN HEALTH CARE

01:03:39.382 --> 01:03:40.950
BECAUSE I WORK IN THE HEALTHCARE

01:03:41.017 --> 01:03:42.885
SECTOR BECAUSE I WORK IN IT IN

THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR RIGHT SO

01:03:44.854 --> 01:03:46.789
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

01:03:46.856 --> 01:03:48.157
FOR THE SURVEY EVEN AS AN

01:03:48.224 --> 01:03:49.492
IMPERFECT TOOL IT'S STILL A

01:03:49.559 --> 01:03:50.993
REALLY CRITICAL TOOL FOR

01:03:54.130 --> 01:03:55.631
THEY BELIEVE THEY ARE WORKING

01:03:55.698 --> 01:03:57.099
WITHIN THAT SECTOR THAT THEY

01:03:57.166 --> 01:03:59.001
TRAIN FOR OUT WHERE THEY ARE

01:03:59.068 --> 01:04:00.403
WORKING WITHIN THE SECTOR THEY

01:04:02.572 --> 01:04:06.209
INCREASES IN EARNINGS AND AN ACT

YEAH HIGHER INCREASES IN

01:04:06.909 --> 01:04:08.744
EARNINGS. AND I GUESS THE TEST

01:04:08.811 --> 01:04:11.480
IS HOW YOU HOW YOU MOVE BEYOND

REGIONAL AND TALK TO EMPLOYERS

01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:29.098
TO DEAL WITH SPECIFIC NEEDS AND

01:04:29.165 --> 01:04:31.300
DESIGN TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR

01:04:31.367 --> 01:04:36.205
SPECIFIC. NEEDS AND THAT'S FINE.

01:04:36.272 --> 01:04:38.107
BUT THAT'S IT'S- TO- INSTITUTE.

01:04:38.174 --> 01:04:39.342
THAT IF I CAN USE THE STATE AS

01:04:39.408 --> 01:04:41.444
AN INSTITUTION AND TAKE IT

01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:43.613
STATEWIDE. RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S

WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD THAT

01:04:55.992 --> 01:04:58.828

YES AND NO RIGHT I THINK IT'S A

01:05:03.099 --> 01:05:05.101
BOTH DAN. I THINK ONE OF THE

01:05:05.167 --> 01:05:06.602
CHALLENGES THAT WE DEFINITELY

01:05:06.669 --> 01:05:08.738
HAVE IS A SYSTEM. THAT MAKES IT

01:05:08.804 --> 01:05:10.139
HARDER FOR US TO BOTH CAPTURE

01:05:10.206 --> 01:05:11.674
THE DATA AS WELL AS MAKE SURE

01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:12.742
THAT WE ARE ASKING THE RIGHT

01:05:12.808 --> 01:05:14.910
QUESTIONS. IS THAT WE HAVEN'T

01:05:14.977 --> 01:05:16.779

01:05:23.519 --> 01:05:24.720
THERE IS A LOT OF WORK FORCE AN

01:05:24.787 --> 01:05:26.689
EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY. FINANCE

01:05:26.756 --> 01:05:27.723
ENGAGEMENT HAPPENING THROUGH

TO THE WORKFORCE INFRASTRUCTURE-

01:05:39.068 --> 01:05:40.336
EITHER BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT'S

01:05:40.403 --> 01:05:41.737
STRUCTURED ON A CAMPUS WHERE THE

01:05:41.804 --> 01:05:43.639

01:11:51.173 --> 01:11:52.508
SAME LIMITATION THAT ALL THE

GET THEIR CONTRACT WITH US THEY

01:12:18.133 --> 01:12:20.803

GIVE US THE WAGE FOR THAT

01:12:23.839 --> 01:12:25.941
TRAINEE THEY WOULD PERFORM THEIR

01:12:26.008 --> 01:12:27.676

THIS BECAUSE ONE IMPLEMENTATION

EXPANDED DATA COLLECTION AND

01:23:27.936 --> 01:23:29.938
EFFECTIVENESS AND SHOULD CEASE

01:23:32.173 --> 01:23:34.776
MY REMARKS THERE LOOKS FORWARD

01:23:34.843 --> 01:23:36.544
TO THE CONVERSATION. THANK YOU I

01:23:36.611 --> 01:23:38.580
WAS GOING TO ASK. WHAT OTHER

01:23:38.646 --> 01:23:40.482
DATA POINTS MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO

01:23:40.548 --> 01:23:42.751
US BUT I THINK OF YOU. WOUND UP

01:23:42.817 --> 01:23:44.219
BY MENTIONING THOSE THE RACE

01:23:44.285 --> 01:23:46.721
HOUSING ISSUES CREDENTIAL OR NOT

01:23:46.788 --> 01:23:47.355
ITS CENTER IN OAKLAND THE LIST

01:23:47.422 --> 01:23:49.257
THAT YOU MENTIONED. AND I

01:23:49.324 --> 01:23:50.692
THOUGHT I CAUGHT YOU SAYING THAT

01:23:50.759 --> 01:23:52.227
IT WAS USED FOR DATA POINTS

01:23:52.293 --> 01:23:53.995
COLLECTED BY THE LOCAL WORKFORCE

01:23:54.062 --> 01:23:55.296
DEVELOPMENT BOARDS AND HOW HOW

01:23:55.363 --> 01:23:57.565
DID THAT WORK IN THE STATES THAT

01:23:57.632 --> 01:24:00.368
THAT HAVE HAPPENED. SO IN STATES

01:24:00.435 --> 01:24:02.237
WHERE ALL THIS WORK IS HAPPENING

01:24:02.303 --> 01:24:04.539
AGAIN I TEND TO USE MINNESOTA AS

01:24:04.606 --> 01:24:05.940
AN EXAMPLE HERE WHO'S REALLY

01:24:06.007 --> 01:24:07.942
ADVANCED PUBLIC REPORTING OF

01:24:08.009 --> 01:24:10.478
THESE OUTCOMES DATA. IS REALLY

01:24:10.545 --> 01:24:12.514
EMBODYING WHAT THE DATA BEING

01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:14.682
COLLECTED AT EITHER THAT LOCAL

01:24:14.749 --> 01:24:16.484
WORK FORCE LEVEL OR FROM THE

01:24:16.551 --> 01:24:18.186
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS

01:24:18.253 --> 01:24:19.921
WITH MINISTER. WORKFORCE

01:24:19.988 --> 01:24:21.990
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS SO IT'S

01:24:22.056 --> 01:24:24.559
REALLY BUILT INTO A CASE

01:24:24.626 --> 01:24:26.995
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT CONTAINS.

01:24:27.061 --> 01:24:29.564
A COMMON AND STANDARD

01:24:29.631 --> 01:24:31.833
DEFINITIONS FOR ALL OF THESE

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:34.302
DATA ELEMENTS SO THAT AT THE END

01:24:34.369 --> 01:24:36.104
OF THE DAY YOU CAN HAVE A PUBLIC

01:24:36.171 --> 01:24:39.607
FACING. OUR TOOL A REPORT CARD

01:24:39.674 --> 01:24:41.509
THAT'S COMPARING LIKE A DATA TO

01:24:41.576 --> 01:24:43.344
LIKE DATA. AND I REALLY UP

01:24:43.411 --> 01:24:45.547
LIFTED THE NEED TO DISAGGREGATE

01:24:45.613 --> 01:24:47.182
THIS INFORMATION. YOU KNOW BY

01:24:47.248 --> 01:24:48.817
THINGS LIKE RACE ETHNICITY

01:24:48.883 --> 01:24:52.020
GENDER- AND SO ON. BECAUSE IT IS

01:24:52.086 --> 01:24:53.688
THE RECOGNITION ALSO THAT

01:24:53.755 --> 01:24:55.790
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS SERVE

01:24:55.857 --> 01:24:59.360
DIFFERENT- POPULATIONS. AND THAT

01:24:59.427 --> 01:25:02.230
IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL AND USEFUL.

01:25:02.297 --> 01:25:03.898
AS A PART OF THAT PUBLIC

01:25:03.965 --> 01:25:06.468
REPORTING TO LOOK AT. AT WHO IS

01:25:06.534 --> 01:25:08.770
BEING SERVED AND WHAT PARTICULAR

01:25:08.837 --> 01:25:11.306
PROGRAMS AND OUR PROVIDERS ARE

01:25:11.372 --> 01:25:13.842
PRODUCING THE BEST RESULTS AND

01:25:13.908 --> 01:25:15.543
THE MOST YOU KNOW LABOR MARKET

01:25:15.610 --> 01:25:16.845
ALIGNED RESULTS FOR THE

01:25:16.911 --> 01:25:18.046
PARTICIPANTS THAT THEY'RE

01:25:18.112 --> 01:25:19.747
SERVING. IN THOSE STATES THAT

01:25:19.814 --> 01:25:21.149
HAVE IMPLEMENTED THIS I GUESS

01:25:21.216 --> 01:25:23.284
MINNESOTA BEING ONE. WHERE THE

01:25:23.351 --> 01:25:24.552
LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT

01:25:24.619 --> 01:25:25.954
BOARDS ACTUALLY TAKE A ROLE IN

01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:29.724
COLLECTING ADDITIONAL DATA

01:25:29.791 --> 01:25:30.391
POINTS BEYOND THE BASE WAGE FILE.

01:25:30.458 --> 01:25:32.126
HAVE YOU FOUND THAT THE BLOKE A

01:25:32.193 --> 01:25:33.862
WORK DEVELOPMENT BOARDS ARE

01:25:33.928 --> 01:25:36.431
ALREADY STAFFED FOR THIS SORT OF

01:25:36.498 --> 01:25:40.068
THE DUTY OR- HAS IT REQUIRED

01:25:40.134 --> 01:25:41.803
ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM THE

01:25:41.870 --> 01:25:44.939
STATE TO. IMPLEMENT THIS

01:25:45.006 --> 01:25:48.176
ADDITIONAL REPORTING. SO IT IS

01:25:48.243 --> 01:25:49.811
CERTAINLY THE CASE THAT FUNDING

01:25:49.878 --> 01:25:51.679
FOR DATA SYSTEMS ARE CHANGING

01:25:51.746 --> 01:25:54.115
CHANGES TO EXISTING SYSTEMS CAN

01:25:54.182 --> 01:25:55.583
BE FUNDAMENTAL FOR THE

01:25:55.650 --> 01:25:58.219
SUCCESSFUL EXPANSION OF A DATA

01:25:58.286 --> 01:26:00.688
ACCESS AND OUTCOMES REPORTING- I

01:26:00.755 --> 01:26:02.957
THINK WHERE IT IS OFTEN SEEN IS

01:26:03.024 --> 01:26:04.759
IN THE COMMUNICATION THAT IS

01:26:04.826 --> 01:26:06.327

WHITE BASS REG FILE SOME

01:55:57.583 --> 01:55:59.385
URGENCY. AND THE GOOD NEWS I

01:55:59.452 --> 01:56:00.653
THINK IS THAT OTHER STATES AND

01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:01.621
COUNTRIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THIS

01:56:01.688 --> 01:56:03.623
IS POSSIBLE. I HAVE PROVIDED

01:56:03.690 --> 01:56:05.124
INFORMATION ON HOW TO MOVE

01:56:05.191 --> 01:56:08.861
FORWARD. OUT FOR DECADES YOU I

01:56:08.928 --> 01:56:10.496
BASICALLY FIND HAVE BEEN THE

01:56:10.563 --> 01:56:12.832
BACKBONE OF ANY EVALUATION OF

01:56:12.899 --> 01:56:14.901
TRAINING AND EDUCATION PROGRAM

01:56:14.967 --> 01:56:15.968
IN CALIFORNIA AND THE UNITED

01:56:16.035 --> 01:56:18.204
STATES AND THESE DATA PROVIDE

01:56:18.271 --> 01:56:19.605
INVALUABLE AND TIMELY

01:56:19.672 --> 01:56:20.406

ALLOW REALLY DETAILED INSIGHTS

01:56:24.577 --> 01:56:26.346
FOR ALL EMPLOYEES IN CALIFORNIA

01:56:26.412 --> 01:56:27.480
IN SUCH COMPREHENSIVE

01:56:27.547 --> 01:56:28.681
INFORMATION WOULD NEARLY BE

01:56:28.748 --> 01:56:30.683
IMPOSSIBLE TO OBTAIN THE OTHER

01:56:30.750 --> 01:56:32.852
DATA SOURCES. HOWEVER YOU KNOW

01:56:32.919 --> 01:56:34.354
AS AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THE

01:56:34.420 --> 01:56:36.322
CURRENT ELEMENTS ARE VERY COARSE

01:56:36.389 --> 01:56:37.690
AND IMPOSE SUBSTANTIAL

01:56:37.757 --> 01:56:40.093
IMITATIONS WHAT WE CAN LEARN TO

01:56:40.159 --> 01:56:41.294
GIVE YOU A SENSE FOR EACH

01:56:41.361 --> 01:56:43.062
EMPLOYEE THE BASS REG FILES

CURRENTLY CONTAIN ONLY TOTAL

01:56:44.831 --> 01:56:47.700
QUARTERLY EARNINGS. AT EACH

01:56:47.767 --> 01:56:48.801
EMPLOYER. THIS IS PARTLY BECAUSE

01:56:48.868 --> 01:56:51.437
THE EXISTING BASE WHICH FILE IS

01:56:51.504 --> 01:56:51.971
A PRODUCT OF THE NINETEEN

01:56:52.038 --> 01:56:54.574
NINETIES. SO THE GOOD NEWS HERE

01:56:54.640 --> 01:56:56.175
IS THAT THE AVAILABLE DATA

01:56:56.242 --> 01:56:57.276
REALLY GIVES THE IDEAL

01:56:57.343 --> 01:56:58.678
FOUNDATION ON WHICH TO BUILD A

01:56:58.745 --> 01:57:00.847
DATA INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT RISES

01:57:00.913 --> 01:57:02.615
TO THE CHALLENGES OF OUR TIME.

01:57:02.682 --> 01:57:04.250
AND I'M GONNA GO GOING TO FOCUS

01:57:04.317 --> 01:57:06.452
ON FOR DATA ELEMENTS. THAT WOULD

01:57:06.519 --> 01:57:07.987
SUBSTANTIALLY ENHANCE THE WHITE

01:57:08.054 --> 01:57:09.689
BASE WHICH FILE AND WHAT WE CAN

01:57:09.756 --> 01:57:12.258
DO WITH THAT. PERSON TO PATIENT

01:57:12.325 --> 01:57:13.126
THE SECOND IS HOURS AND WEEKS

01:57:13.192 --> 01:57:16.396
WORK THE THIRTIES PLACE OF WORK.

01:57:16.462 --> 01:57:17.330
AND THE FOURTH IS BASIC WORKER

01:57:17.397 --> 01:57:19.232
DEMOGRAPHICS. THESE FOUR

01:57:19.298 --> 01:57:21.100
ELEMENTS. HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY

01:57:21.167 --> 01:57:23.169
COLLECTED AT MANAGEABLE COSTS IN

01:57:23.236 --> 01:57:25.037
OTHER STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES

01:57:25.104 --> 01:57:26.873
AND THEY WOULD REALLY HAVE

01:57:26.939 --> 01:57:27.907
SUBSTANTIAL BENEFITS FOR

01:57:27.974 --> 01:57:29.709
CALIFORNIA'S WORKERS EMPLOYERS

01:57:29.776 --> 01:57:30.877
AND THE STATE OF THE WHOLE RIGHT

01:57:30.943 --> 01:57:31.911
THEY WOULD FURTHER IMPROVE OUR

01:57:31.978 --> 01:57:33.346
UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT FOR

01:57:33.413 --> 01:57:35.148
TRAINING AND EDUCATION SYSTEM.

01:57:35.214 --> 01:57:35.948
DID THEY WERE ALLOWED TO BETTER

01:57:36.015 --> 01:57:37.784
TRACK DEVELOPING OF THE

01:57:37.850 --> 01:57:39.685
CALIFORNIA ECONOMY AS A WHOLE

01:57:39.752 --> 01:57:41.387
BUT ALSO DOWN TO THE FINE

01:57:41.454 --> 01:57:43.423
GRAINED LOCAL LEVEL. AND THEY

01:57:43.489 --> 01:57:45.391
WOULD ALLOW US TO BETTER MEASURE

01:57:45.458 --> 01:57:47.059
THE EFFECTS OF KEY REGULATIONS

01:57:47.126 --> 01:57:48.628
IN THE LABOR MARKET SUCH AS THAT

01:57:48.694 --> 01:57:50.530
MINIMUM WAGE. AND THEY WOULD

01:57:50.596 --> 01:57:51.731
ALLOW CALIFORNIA TO FURTHER

01:57:51.798 --> 01:57:54.801
IMPROVE ITS SERVICES FOR THE

01:57:54.867 --> 01:57:55.735
UNEMPLOYED. I WILL GIVE YOU MY

01:57:55.802 --> 01:57:57.670
PERSPECTIVE ON THESE PROPOSED

01:57:57.737 --> 01:57:59.071
FOR DATA ELEMENTS. FROM THE

01:57:59.138 --> 01:58:00.840
POINT OF VIEW OF AN EXPERT. IN

01:58:00.907 --> 01:58:02.442

DECADES OF RESEARCH VERY CLEARLY

01:58:23.663 --> 01:58:25.231
TO THE NEED TO ADD THE FOUR DATA

01:58:25.298 --> 01:58:26.799
ELEMENTS I MENTIONED TO THE BASE

01:58:26.866 --> 01:58:29.101
WAGE FILES AND I BELIEVE THE

01:58:29.168 --> 01:58:31.437
CASE FOR ADDING EACH OF THESE

01:58:31.504 --> 01:58:32.472
DATA ELEMENTS IS ACTUALLY VERY

01:58:32.538 --> 01:58:34.774
STRONG NOW CONSIDER FIRST THE

01:58:34.841 --> 01:58:37.410
CASE FOR MEASURING HOURS AND

01:58:37.477 --> 01:58:38.010
WEEKS WORKED AS WELL AS A NEW

01:58:38.077 --> 01:58:41.647
PATIENT. MEASURING HOURS. WEEKLY

01:58:41.714 --> 01:58:43.483
HOURS WORKED WOULD ALLOW ONE TO

01:58:43.549 --> 01:58:45.685
INFER THE EFFECTIVE HOURLY WAGE

01:58:45.751 --> 01:58:47.553
RATE FOR EACH WORKER. THAT'S

01:58:47.620 --> 01:58:49.121
CRUCIAL BECAUSE HOURLY WAGES ARE

01:58:49.188 --> 01:58:50.857
ROUTINELY USED BY CONDOMS TO

01:58:50.923 --> 01:58:52.558
MEASURE HOW PRODUCTIVE WORKERS

01:58:52.625 --> 01:58:55.595
ARE AND WHAT A GOOD JOB AS- AS A

01:58:55.661 --> 01:58:57.196
RESULT ALI WAGES ARE USING

01:58:57.263 --> 01:58:58.464
EMPIRICAL WORK ALL OVER THE

01:58:58.531 --> 01:59:00.466
WORLD AND IN MANY DISCIPLINES.

01:59:00.533 --> 01:59:01.968
TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

01:59:02.034 --> 01:59:02.535
THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING

01:59:02.602 --> 01:59:05.771
PROGRAMS. IN A SIMILAR FASHION

01:59:05.838 --> 01:59:07.540
OCCUPATION IT IS A KEY INPUT AND

01:59:07.607 --> 01:59:08.341
UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEIR

01:59:08.407 --> 01:59:09.976
EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROGRAMS

01:59:10.042 --> 01:59:11.143
ARE SUCCESSFUL AT PLACING

01:59:11.210 --> 01:59:13.279
WORKERS INTO BETTER JOBS IT

01:59:13.346 --> 01:59:14.814
RAISING LIVING STANDARDS AND A

01:59:14.881 --> 01:59:16.916
GENERATING A HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE

01:59:16.983 --> 01:59:18.784
WORKFORCE. HELP WITHOUT

01:59:18.851 --> 01:59:20.086
INFORMATION ON HOURS AND A FEW

01:59:20.152 --> 01:59:21.954
PATIENTS IT IS MORE DIFFICULT TO

01:59:22.021 --> 01:59:23.756
FULLY EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS

01:59:23.823 --> 01:59:24.757
OF OUR EDUCATION AND TRAINING

01:59:24.824 --> 01:59:27.159
SYSTEM. BUT I DO UNDERSTAND

01:59:27.226 --> 01:59:27.894
WHERE THEIR DRESS ADDRESSES THE

01:59:27.960 --> 01:59:29.996
MANY CHALLENGES OF THE PANDEMIC

01:59:30.062 --> 01:59:32.298
BUT THE CHANGING NATURE OF WORK.

01:59:32.365 --> 01:59:34.467
AMONG OTHERS. OF COURSE THE

01:59:34.534 --> 01:59:35.701
CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT

01:59:35.768 --> 01:59:37.203
BOARD AND THE MANY AGENCIES

01:59:37.270 --> 01:59:38.738
PROVIDING EDUCATION AND TRAINING

01:59:38.804 --> 01:59:40.606
IN CALIFORNIA WORK VERY HARD

01:59:40.673 --> 01:59:42.542
EVERY DAY TO ASSESS THE IMPACT

01:59:42.608 --> 01:59:44.577
AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS

01:59:44.644 --> 01:59:45.044
TRAINING SERVICES AND

01:59:45.111 --> 01:59:47.013
EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS. THE POINT

01:59:47.079 --> 01:59:49.215
HERE IS THAT INFORMATION HOURS

01:59:49.282 --> 01:59:51.384
OKAY PATIENT. AS WELL AS THE

01:59:51.450 --> 01:59:52.818
OTHER DATA MANAGEMENT THAT I

01:59:52.885 --> 01:59:54.587
MENTIONED WOULD REALLY HELP.

01:59:54.654 --> 01:59:56.188
WITH THAT PROCESS RIGHT WITH

01:59:56.255 --> 01:59:58.190
THESE DATA WE CAN FIGURE OUT

01:59:58.257 --> 01:59:59.225
WHICH EDUCATION AND TRAINING

01:59:59.292 --> 02:00:00.960
PROGRAMS. ACTUALLY IMPROVE JOB

02:00:01.027 --> 02:00:02.995
QUALITY. WE CAN FIGURE OUT

02:00:03.062 --> 02:00:04.297
WHETHER SOME PROGRAMS WORK

02:00:04.363 --> 02:00:06.299
BETTER FOR SOME INDIVIDUALS AND

02:00:06.365 --> 02:00:08.501
OTHERS. EITHER BY DEMOGRAPHIC

02:00:08.568 --> 02:00:11.737
GROUPS ARE BY. LOCAL ECONOMIES

02:00:11.804 --> 02:00:13.306
AND WE CAN THEN USE THIS

02:00:13.372 --> 02:00:15.474
INFORMATION TO BETTER TARGET

02:00:15.541 --> 02:00:17.043
EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROGRAMS

02:00:17.109 --> 02:00:19.312
ACROSS THEM A GRAPHIC GROUPS AND

02:00:19.378 --> 02:00:21.714
LOCAL LABOR MARKETS. HOURS

02:00:21.781 --> 02:00:22.949
WORKED AND OCCUPATION ALSO

02:00:23.015 --> 02:00:24.650
GREATLY HELPED ENHANCE THE VALUE

02:00:24.717 --> 02:00:26.819
OF EXISTING. DATA INVESTMENT

02:00:26.886 --> 02:00:28.287
THAT REALLY HAVE IMPROVED WHAT

02:00:28.354 --> 02:00:29.655
WE KNOW ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA

02:00:29.722 --> 02:00:30.623
LABOR MARKETS YOU'RE SUCH A

02:00:30.690 --> 02:00:34.093
SNACK. CAL SKILLS DATA FOR THE

02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:34.527
CROWN TO CAREER DATA

02:00:34.594 --> 02:00:37.630
INFRASTRUCTURE. I BELIEVE WE

02:00:37.697 --> 02:00:38.564
TURN TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THE

02:00:38.631 --> 02:00:39.999
TWO OTHER DATA ELEMENTS I

02:00:40.066 --> 02:00:42.635
MENTIONED WHICH IS LOCATION OF

02:00:42.702 --> 02:00:43.102
WORKS AND DEMOGRAPHIC

02:00:43.169 --> 02:00:45.338
CHARACTERISTICS. AS SENATOR ROTH

02:00:45.404 --> 02:00:47.106
HAS HELPED TO ZOOM IN ON QUITE

02:00:47.173 --> 02:00:48.407
BITTER POLITICALLY FOR SOME OF

02:00:48.474 --> 02:00:49.942
US IS THAT SUCH INFORMATION

02:00:50.009 --> 02:00:51.677
INFORMATION ON PLACE OF WORK.

02:00:51.744 --> 02:00:52.678
WOULD ALLOW US TO BETTER

02:00:52.745 --> 02:00:54.280
UNDERSTAND WHICH EDUCATION AND

02:00:54.347 --> 02:00:55.815
TRAINING PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE

02:00:55.881 --> 02:00:58.084
LOCALLY. AS THE LABOR MARKET IS

02:00:58.150 --> 02:00:58.851
CHANGING AT THE END OF THE

02:00:58.918 --> 02:01:00.553
PANDEMIC IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

02:01:00.620 --> 02:01:01.621
TO UNDERSTAND DIFFERENCES BY

02:01:01.687 --> 02:01:04.757
LOCAL LABOR MARKET AND BY

02:01:04.824 --> 02:01:05.191
DEMOGRAPHIC RECORDS.

02:01:05.257 --> 02:01:05.958
CHARACTERISTICS WHAT WE

02:01:06.025 --> 02:01:08.227
CURRENTLY KNOW. COMMUNITIES WITH

02:01:08.294 --> 02:01:09.362
MORE BLACK RESIDENTS MORE

02:01:09.428 --> 02:01:11.063
HISPANIC RESIDENT RESIDENTS AND

02:01:11.130 --> 02:01:12.632
POOR NEIGHBORHOODS. HAVE BEEN

02:01:12.698 --> 02:01:14.200
MORE STRONGLY AFFECTED BY THE

02:01:14.266 --> 02:01:15.334
PANDEMIC AND HAVE RECOVERED MORE

02:01:15.401 --> 02:01:17.336
SLOWLY. BUT WE COULD KNOW MUCH

02:01:17.403 --> 02:01:19.171
MUCH MORE ABOUT HOW THESE

02:01:19.238 --> 02:01:20.206
COMMUNITIES ARE IMPACTED AND HOW

02:01:20.272 --> 02:01:22.708
TO HELP THEM. YEAH IN ADDITION

02:01:22.775 --> 02:01:23.909
YOU KNOW WITHIN VOTE INVOLVING

02:01:23.976 --> 02:01:25.244
CLIMATE. IT WOULD BECOME

02:01:25.311 --> 02:01:26.646
INCREASINGLY URGENT TO

02:01:26.712 --> 02:01:28.881
UNDERSTAND THE LOCAL IMPACT. OF

02:01:28.948 --> 02:01:29.548
NATURAL DISASTERS SUCH AS

02:01:29.615 --> 02:01:32.018
WILDFIRES. IT IS CURRENTLY NOT

02:01:32.084 --> 02:01:33.619
POSSIBLE IN THE BASE WHICH FILE.

02:01:33.686 --> 02:01:35.755
AT LEAST FOR THE MANY EMPLOYERS

02:01:35.821 --> 02:01:37.857
WITH WITH MULTIPLE JOB SITES.

02:01:37.923 --> 02:01:39.859
NOW TO GATHER THESE FOUR DATA

02:01:39.925 --> 02:01:41.961
ELEMENTS BESIDES IMPROVING OUR

02:01:42.028 --> 02:01:44.063
PROVISION OF EDUCATION AND

02:01:44.130 --> 02:01:46.198
TRAINING AND BESIDES TRACKING.

02:01:46.265 --> 02:01:49.435
HOW THE ECONOMY'S DOING RIGHT.

02:01:49.502 --> 02:01:51.704
AT THE CALIFORNIA LEVELED ON THE

02:01:51.771 --> 02:01:52.304
LOCAL LEVEL OF MY DEMOGRAPHIC

02:01:52.371 --> 02:01:54.640
GROUPS RIGHT. IT WILL ALSO ALLOW

02:01:54.707 --> 02:01:55.908
BETTER UNDERSTANDING HOW LABOR

02:01:55.975 --> 02:01:58.144
MARKET REGULATIONS AFFECT

02:01:58.210 --> 02:02:00.279
WORKERS BUSINESSES AND LOCAL

02:02:00.346 --> 02:02:00.880
LABOR MARKET WE'RE GONNA GIVE

02:02:00.946 --> 02:02:02.682
YOU AN EXAMPLE. WHEN WE

02:02:02.748 --> 02:02:03.849
EVALUATED THE MINIMUM WAGE

02:02:03.916 --> 02:02:05.918
ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF LA. THE

02:02:05.985 --> 02:02:08.554
ABSENCE OF DATA ON OURS. RIGHT

02:02:08.621 --> 02:02:10.790
WAS AN IMPORTANT LIMITATION. AS

02:02:10.856 --> 02:02:12.525
A RESULT WE COULD NOT FIGURE OUT

02:02:12.591 --> 02:02:13.859
WHICH BUSINESS IS ACTUALLY WE'RE

02:02:13.926 --> 02:02:15.728
EMPLOYING WORKERS AFFECTED BY

02:02:15.795 --> 02:02:17.396
THE MINIMUM WAGE. THAT WAS A

02:02:17.463 --> 02:02:19.165
REAL LOSS NOW OF COURSE WE WANT

02:02:19.231 --> 02:02:20.466
TO SEE WHICH WORKERS ACTUALLY

02:02:20.533 --> 02:02:21.834
BENEFITED BY THE MINIMUM WAGE

02:02:21.901 --> 02:02:23.769
WHICH WE COULD NOT. WILLING

02:02:23.836 --> 02:02:25.671
RIGHT WE ALSO WANTED TO SEE

02:02:25.738 --> 02:02:27.173
WHICH SMALLER BUSINESSES MIGHT

02:02:27.239 --> 02:02:29.308
BE STRUGGLING. AND WHICH SMALLER

02:02:29.375 --> 02:02:30.342
BUSINESSES THAT ARE STRUGGLING

02:02:30.409 --> 02:02:31.911
BECAUSE OF INCREASES IN WAGES

02:02:31.977 --> 02:02:33.879
COULD BENEFIT FROM TARGETED

02:02:33.946 --> 02:02:35.481
PROGRAMS FOR SMALL BUSINESS

02:02:35.548 --> 02:02:36.682
DISTRICT THE COUNTY AND CITY

02:02:36.749 --> 02:02:38.718
MADE AVAILABLE. TO YOU KNOW

02:02:38.784 --> 02:02:40.086
BUSINESS AFFECTED BY THE MINIMUM

02:02:40.152 --> 02:02:42.321
WAGE SO THERE WAS A REAL LOSS IN

02:02:42.388 --> 02:02:44.356
AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW OUR

02:02:44.423 --> 02:02:45.991
REGULATIONS AFFECT THE LABOR

02:02:46.058 --> 02:02:48.294
MARKET WORKERS BUSINESSES RIGHT

02:02:48.360 --> 02:02:51.363
BECAUSE OF AN ABSENCE. OF DATA

02:02:51.430 --> 02:02:53.999
ON HOURS WORKED. AND LAST AND

02:02:54.066 --> 02:02:55.267
DEFINITELY NOT LEAST AND WE'VE

02:02:55.334 --> 02:02:56.702
ALREADY DISCUSSED IT IS REALLY

02:02:56.769 --> 02:02:57.837
IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND

02:02:57.903 --> 02:02:59.605
ENHANCING THAT BASE WAGE FIGHT.

02:02:59.672 --> 02:03:01.040
WILL ALSO HELP TO IMPROVE THE

02:03:01.107 --> 02:03:02.041
SERVICES THAT CALIFORNIA

02:03:02.108 --> 02:03:03.709
PROVIDES. TO ITS UNEMPLOYED

02:03:03.776 --> 02:03:06.011
WORKERS BEGAN. TO DISH ALL DATA

02:03:06.078 --> 02:03:07.213
ELEMENTS WOULD ALLOW IT TO

02:03:07.279 --> 02:03:08.547
BETTER MEASURE THE IMPACT OF

02:03:08.614 --> 02:03:10.983
EXISTING SERVICES. AND HELP TO

02:03:11.050 --> 02:03:13.753
PLACE WORKERS INTO APPROPRIATE.

02:03:13.819 --> 02:03:17.256
JOBS AND SERVICES. NO NO LET ME

02:03:17.323 --> 02:03:19.358
SUM UP. ROUTE INFORMATION ON

02:03:19.425 --> 02:03:21.694
HOURS AND LOCATION WOULD ALLOW

02:03:21.761 --> 02:03:22.895
US TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE

02:03:22.962 --> 02:03:23.896
EFFECT OF CHANGES IN THE LABOR

02:03:23.963 --> 02:03:25.364
MARKET. AND ECONOMIC

02:03:25.431 --> 02:03:26.465
OPPORTUNITIES AND TO FURTHER

02:03:26.532 --> 02:03:28.067
IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR

02:03:28.134 --> 02:03:30.603
EDUCATION AND TRAINING SYSTEMS.

02:03:30.669 --> 02:03:31.237
TO REALLY PREPARE CALIFORNIA'S

02:03:31.303 --> 02:03:33.739
WORKFORCE. FOR THE TWENTY FIRST

02:03:33.806 --> 02:03:36.675
CENTURY AND YOU KNOW. LIMIT

02:03:36.742 --> 02:03:38.210
INEQUALITY AND POVERTY.

02:03:38.277 --> 02:03:39.979
INFORMATION ON LOCATION OF

02:03:40.045 --> 02:03:40.980
MARKET DEMOGRAPHIC

02:03:41.046 --> 02:03:42.615
CHARACTERISTICS WILL ALLOW US TO

02:03:42.681 --> 02:03:44.083
BETTER UNDERSTAND WHO BENEFITS

02:03:44.150 --> 02:03:45.551
FROM TRAINING HOW TO FURTHER

02:03:45.618 --> 02:03:47.419
IMPROVE TRAINING DELIVERY AND

02:03:47.486 --> 02:03:48.721
WHO'S BEING MOST AFFECTED BY

02:03:48.788 --> 02:03:50.990
CHANGES IN THE LABOR MARKET. NOW

02:03:51.056 --> 02:03:52.925
GIVEN THE STAGGERING IMPACT OF

02:03:52.992 --> 02:03:54.160
THE PANDEMIC ON THE CALIFORNIA

02:03:54.226 --> 02:03:56.028
LABOR MARKET IN PARTICULAR. ON

02:03:56.095 --> 02:03:57.830
JOBS FOR LOWER AND MIDDLE INCOME

02:03:57.897 --> 02:03:59.598
WORKERS. I BELIEVE THERE IS A

02:03:59.665 --> 02:04:01.400
SENSE OF URGENCY TO MOVE FORWARD

02:04:01.467 --> 02:04:03.235
TO ENHANCE CALIFORNIA'S. U. I.

02:04:03.302 --> 02:04:05.704
BASE WHICH FILE. AND THE GOOD

02:04:05.771 --> 02:04:06.605
NEWS IS THAT OTHER STATES HAVE

02:04:06.672 --> 02:04:08.774
DELIVERED A BLUEPRINT ON HOW TO

02:04:08.841 --> 02:04:11.343
DO IT- SOME EXPERIENCE ON HOW TO

02:04:11.410 --> 02:04:14.046
DO OUTREACH. FOR EXAMPLE OR HOW

02:04:14.113 --> 02:04:16.048
TO INVOLVE PAYROLL PROCESSES.

02:04:16.115 --> 02:04:17.149
AND I THINK NOW THAT THE WORST

02:04:17.216 --> 02:04:19.151
OF THE PANDEMIC IS BEHIND US IT

02:04:19.218 --> 02:04:20.753
MAY BE JUST THE RIGHT MOMENT WE

02:04:20.820 --> 02:04:24.323
HAVE TO ACT ON YOU I BASICALLY.

02:04:24.390 --> 02:04:27.226
THANK YOU. SO WE JUST ASK A

02:04:27.293 --> 02:04:29.795
COUPLE QUESTIONS. I DON'T KNOW

02:04:29.862 --> 02:04:31.330
IF YOU CAN ANSWER THIS BUT DO

02:04:31.397 --> 02:04:33.732
YOU KNOW HOW FAR OFF BASE WE

02:04:33.799 --> 02:04:35.734
ACTUALLY ARE IN TERMS OF

02:04:35.801 --> 02:04:37.870
CONNECTING THE DOTS BETWEEN THE

02:04:37.937 --> 02:04:40.539
JOB TRAINING WE PROVIDE. AND THE

02:04:40.606 --> 02:04:46.045
JOBS THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY SECURE.

02:04:46.111 --> 02:04:50.115
YES A VERY GOOD QUESTION AN

02:04:50.182 --> 02:04:51.984
IMPORTANT QUESTION AND I ONLY

02:04:52.051 --> 02:04:53.385
HAVE A PARTIAL ANSWER IN THE

02:04:53.452 --> 02:04:56.889
SENSE THAT. YEAH BUT THE TEMPO

02:04:56.956 --> 02:04:59.124
TO THIS EARLIER. SEVERAL OF THE

02:04:59.191 --> 02:05:01.160
PROGRAMS THAT BE EVALUATED IN

02:05:01.227 --> 02:05:02.628
THE COUNCIL STATUS USING

02:05:02.695 --> 02:05:04.563
QUARTERLY EARNINGS WHICH BY THE

02:05:04.630 --> 02:05:06.732
WAY THAT'S THE INDUSTRY STANDARD

02:05:06.799 --> 02:05:08.300
FOR ANY EVALUATION FOR ANY STATE

02:05:08.367 --> 02:05:10.302
OR THE FEDERAL LEVEL. FOR

02:05:10.369 --> 02:05:11.937
TRAINING PROGRAMS LIKE THESE

02:05:12.004 --> 02:05:13.539
TRAINING PROGRAMS ARE EFFECTIVE

02:05:13.606 --> 02:05:16.041
AND RAISING WAGES. RIGHT OKAY I

02:05:16.108 --> 02:05:17.376
SHOULD SAY THIS EXACTLY FOUNDER

02:05:17.443 --> 02:05:18.844
EFFECT OF IT RAISING EARNINGS

02:05:18.911 --> 02:05:19.879
BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY

02:05:19.945 --> 02:05:21.747
EFFECTIVELY RAISE WAGES OR THEY

02:05:21.814 --> 02:05:25.751
EFFECTIVELY RAVES ALWAYS WORKS

02:05:25.818 --> 02:05:26.285
SO WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THE

02:05:26.352 --> 02:05:26.886
WORKERS ARE ACTUALLY GETTING.

02:05:26.952 --> 02:05:28.821
BETTER JOBS RIGHT OR WHETHER

02:05:28.888 --> 02:05:29.455
THEY'RE WORKING MORE AND THAT'S

02:05:29.521 --> 02:05:31.056
JUST A CRUCIAL DISTINCTION WE

02:05:31.123 --> 02:05:32.591
ALSO DON'T REALLY KNOW AT LEAST

02:05:32.658 --> 02:05:35.361
FROM. THOSE DATA RIGHT WHETHER

02:05:35.427 --> 02:05:37.796
WORKERS ACTUALLY END UP IN AN

02:05:37.863 --> 02:05:40.432
OCCUPATION THEY WERE TRAINED FOR-

02:05:40.499 --> 02:05:42.301
NOW. THERE IS OTHER INFORMATION

02:05:42.368 --> 02:05:43.769
COLLECTED BY THE TRAINING

02:05:43.836 --> 02:05:45.771
PROVIDERS THAT IS CAN BE USED TO

02:05:45.838 --> 02:05:47.573
ASSESS THAT QUESTION BUT WHAT WE

02:05:47.640 --> 02:05:49.909
CANNOT DO. IS DO THAT ANALYSIS

02:05:49.975 --> 02:05:51.877
COMPREHENSIVELY ACROSS ALL

02:05:51.944 --> 02:05:53.445
TRAINING PROVIDERS ARE ACROSS

02:05:53.512 --> 02:05:55.014
ALL WORKERS OR LOCATIONS IN

02:05:55.080 --> 02:05:56.715
CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT

02:05:56.782 --> 02:05:59.151
COLLECTING ALWAYS WORK OR WE'RE

02:05:59.218 --> 02:06:01.153
NOT COLLECTING OCCUPATION. WHICH

02:06:01.220 --> 02:06:03.322
IS THE ISSUE WHAT WE WERE

02:06:03.389 --> 02:06:04.890
TALKING ABOUT WITH THE COMMUNITY

02:06:04.957 --> 02:06:06.825
COLLEGE TRAINING PROGRAMS THE-

02:06:06.892 --> 02:06:08.427
THE RESULTS STATED TENDS TO BE

02:06:08.494 --> 02:06:11.030
ANECDOTAL. IN PARTICULAR REGIONS

02:06:11.096 --> 02:06:12.498
WHERE RELATIONSHIPS ALL OF THE

02:06:12.564 --> 02:06:14.767
DATA FLOW TO GO BOTH WAYS I

02:06:14.833 --> 02:06:16.402
ASSUME. AND I THINK THAT'S

02:06:16.468 --> 02:06:18.671
PROBABLY WHAT YOU MUST BE

02:06:18.737 --> 02:06:21.607
TALKING ABOUT SIR. WELL THERE IS

02:06:21.674 --> 02:06:24.343
IN OTHER WAYS TO GET INFORMATION

02:06:24.410 --> 02:06:26.645
ABOUT YOUR DEBT TO ACCEPTANCE OF

02:06:26.712 --> 02:06:27.613
TRAINING WHEN I'M I'M TALKING

02:06:27.680 --> 02:06:30.149
ABOUT. ESSENTIALLY STATISTICAL

02:06:30.215 --> 02:06:32.184
EVALUATION FOR EXAMPLE OF

02:06:32.251 --> 02:06:33.986
WHETHER A PARTICULAR. YOU CAN

02:06:34.053 --> 02:06:35.754
PROGRAM A TRAINING PROGRAM

02:06:35.821 --> 02:06:37.189
RAISES THE OUTCOME OF THE

02:06:37.256 --> 02:06:39.425
WORKERS ATTENDING IT NEXT OFTEN

02:06:39.491 --> 02:06:40.492
DONE WE ARE SEPARATE TREATMENT

02:06:40.559 --> 02:06:42.995
CONTROL COMPARISON. AND THEN ONE

02:06:43.062 --> 02:06:45.798
NEEDS AN OTCOME AND WHAT COULD

02:06:45.864 --> 02:06:48.000
USE VARIOUS OUTCOMES ARE. OFTEN

02:06:48.067 --> 02:06:49.568
ONE NEEDS VERY LARGE DATASETS TO

02:06:49.635 --> 02:06:51.637
EFFECTIVELY DO SUCH A

02:06:51.704 --> 02:06:52.571
STATISTICAL TREATMENT CONTROL

02:06:52.638 --> 02:06:54.707
COMPARISON ANDY WHY BASE WHICH

02:06:54.773 --> 02:06:56.809
FILE IS USUALLY THE GO TO PLACE

02:06:56.875 --> 02:06:59.678
TO DO THAT. IN THE ABSENCE TO DO

02:06:59.745 --> 02:07:00.679
TO ACTUALLY GET SUCH A

02:07:00.746 --> 02:07:01.613
STATISTICAL MEASURE

02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:04.483
EFFECTIVENESS THERE ARE WAYS TO

02:07:04.550 --> 02:07:06.285
DOING EITHER YOU KNOW INTERVIEWS

02:07:06.352 --> 02:07:08.754
OF CASE WORKERS OR DATA

02:07:08.821 --> 02:07:09.755
COLLECTIONS THROUGH EXIT

02:07:09.822 --> 02:07:13.959
INTERVIEWS OR- SURVEYS THAT CAN

02:07:14.026 --> 02:07:15.894
YOU KNOW GET A FINE GRAIN VIEW

02:07:15.961 --> 02:07:16.829
ON THE GROUND OF WHAT IS

02:07:16.895 --> 02:07:18.630
HAPPENING. IT JUST GETS MUCH

02:07:18.697 --> 02:07:20.332
MORE DIFFICULT TO AGGREGATE THAT

02:07:20.399 --> 02:07:22.001
UP AND TOOK IT TO GET A BIRD'S

02:07:22.067 --> 02:07:24.536
EYE VIEW RIGHT OFF OF WHERE WE

02:07:24.603 --> 02:07:26.372
ARE AT DOES IT MAKE MORE SENSE

02:07:26.438 --> 02:07:28.607
YES AND TO ACCOMPLISH SIMPLY TO

02:07:28.674 --> 02:07:32.644
ACCOMPLISH THAT I ASSUME. IN THE

02:07:32.711 --> 02:07:33.278
STATE OF FORTY MILLION PEOPLE.

02:07:33.345 --> 02:07:33.846
AS DIVERSE AND LARGE IS THE

02:07:33.912 --> 02:07:35.180
STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS WHEN

02:07:35.247 --> 02:07:36.348
YOU'RE HAVING DO IT RUNNING IN

02:07:36.415 --> 02:07:37.549
IT WHAT WE WOULD CALL IN

02:07:37.616 --> 02:07:39.685
POLITICS A GROUND GAME. AS

02:07:39.752 --> 02:07:41.820
OPPOSED TO CENTRALIZED DATA

02:07:41.887 --> 02:07:44.523
COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS. WELL I

02:07:44.590 --> 02:07:46.859
THINK YOU KNOW WE HAVE DONE A

02:07:46.925 --> 02:07:47.426
LOT OF WORK AND PARTNERSHIPS

02:07:47.493 --> 02:07:50.229
WITH. MANY TRAINING PROVIDERS

02:07:50.295 --> 02:07:51.964
AND EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES AND

02:07:52.031 --> 02:07:54.166
THEY DO INVALUABLE WORK IN

02:07:54.233 --> 02:07:56.635
COLLECTING DATA. CAN I VIEW

02:07:56.702 --> 02:07:59.238
THESE VARIOUS EFFORTS TO COLLECT

02:07:59.304 --> 02:08:01.874
DATA AS COMPLEMENTARY. AND MY

02:08:01.940 --> 02:08:02.608
POINT IS WE'RE MISSING AN

02:08:02.674 --> 02:08:04.510
IMPORTANT PIECE. IS A

02:08:04.576 --> 02:08:06.945
STANDARDIZED COLLECTION OF DATA

02:08:07.012 --> 02:08:08.680
THAT ALLOWS US TO COMPUTE HOURLY

02:08:08.747 --> 02:08:11.450
WAGES AND UNDERSTAND WHICH

02:08:11.517 --> 02:08:13.619
OCCUPATION INDIVIDUALS GET. AND

02:08:13.685 --> 02:08:15.154
THAT WOULD COMPLEMENTALL THE

02:08:15.220 --> 02:08:17.056
DETAILED KNOWLEDGE UNDERGROUND

02:08:17.122 --> 02:08:18.657
DATA TRAINING PROVIDERS

02:08:18.724 --> 02:08:21.493
CURRENTLY HAVE. NO I DON'T KNOW

02:08:21.560 --> 02:08:23.128
I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION I'M NOT

02:08:23.195 --> 02:08:24.630
SURE FROM YOUR VANTAGE POINT IF

02:08:24.696 --> 02:08:27.933
YOU CAN ADDRESS THIS BUT- SHOULD

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.102
WE DECIDE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH

02:08:30.169 --> 02:08:31.737
ENHANCED DATA COLLECTION THE

02:08:31.804 --> 02:08:34.473
BASE WAGE FILE WHATEVER. WHAT

02:08:34.540 --> 02:08:37.276
POTENTIAL- IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES

02:08:37.342 --> 02:08:40.179
AND COST ELEMENTS. HAVE YOU SEEN

02:08:40.245 --> 02:08:42.481
IN THE PAST. WITH EFFORTS SUCH

02:08:42.548 --> 02:08:47.119
AS THAT. HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU

02:08:47.186 --> 02:08:51.924
HAVE- IT DIDN'T- IT IT GETS

02:08:51.990 --> 02:08:52.791
OFTEN INTO THE VERY NITTY

02:08:52.858 --> 02:08:57.329
GRITTY- AT OF WHAT HAPPENS ON

02:08:57.396 --> 02:08:58.964
THE GROUND AS THIS DATA IS

02:08:59.031 --> 02:09:00.666
COLLECTED AND WHEN WE USE THESE

02:09:00.732 --> 02:09:03.001
DATA WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME TO

02:09:03.068 --> 02:09:04.903
REALLY FOLLOW BACK THE PIPELINE.

02:09:04.970 --> 02:09:06.905
FROM WHEN A PERSON SORT OF FILLS

02:09:06.972 --> 02:09:09.341
IN AN ELECTRONIC DATA SHEET TO

02:09:09.408 --> 02:09:10.976
UNDERSTAND HOW THE MEASUREMENT

02:09:11.043 --> 02:09:14.046
ISSUES WORK NOW. I GIVE YOU AN

02:09:14.113 --> 02:09:16.215
EXAMPLE- WHAT SINCE WE WERE

02:09:16.281 --> 02:09:18.951
INTERESTED IN HOURS WORK- AT

02:09:19.017 --> 02:09:23.055
SOME POINT. WE CONTACTED. PEOPLE

02:09:23.122 --> 02:09:24.690
IN THE STATE OF WASHINGTON

02:09:24.756 --> 02:09:27.659
WEAPON COLLECTING HOURS WORK FOR

02:09:27.726 --> 02:09:28.260
QUITE A WHILE AND THE OBVIOUS

02:09:28.327 --> 02:09:31.263
QUESTION WAS. ISN'T IT HARD FOR

02:09:31.330 --> 02:09:33.132
BUSINESSES TO FIGURE OUT ON A

02:09:33.198 --> 02:09:35.167
WEEKLY BASIS HOW MANY HOURS

02:09:35.234 --> 02:09:37.669
THERE ARE. MARKERS WORK WOULDN'T

02:09:37.736 --> 02:09:39.471
DAY EITHER ALL GIVE FORTY HOURS

02:09:39.538 --> 02:09:40.672
WHICH IS FULL TIME OR TWENTY

02:09:40.739 --> 02:09:42.441
HOURS SAY WHICH PART TIME OR OR

02:09:42.508 --> 02:09:44.343
NOT SO IN THIS INFORMATION. SO

02:09:44.409 --> 02:09:45.144
WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE

02:09:45.210 --> 02:09:47.012
NOISE IN THE STATE EYES IS BEING

02:09:47.079 --> 02:09:49.414
COLLECTED. WHERE THE NOISE WOULD

02:09:49.481 --> 02:09:50.582
REFLECT PARTLY THE COST AND THE

02:09:50.649 --> 02:09:52.551
EFFORT. THAT THE EMPLOYERS WOULD

02:09:52.618 --> 02:09:53.986
FACE IN IN IN PROVIDING THE

02:09:54.052 --> 02:09:55.854
STATUS IT TURNED OUT THAT. THE

02:09:55.921 --> 02:09:57.456
DATA ON OURS COLLECTED IN THE

02:09:57.523 --> 02:09:58.757
STATE OF WASHINGTON IT'S A VERY

02:09:58.824 --> 02:10:00.759
HIGH QUALITY AND IT COMES NOT

02:10:00.826 --> 02:10:02.794
ONLY FROM OUR CONVERSATIONS.

02:10:02.861 --> 02:10:04.830
WITH THE FOLKS ON THE GROUND

02:10:04.897 --> 02:10:06.732
COLLECTING THIS DATA. THEY ARE

02:10:06.798 --> 02:10:08.734
KIND OF PART OF THE E. D. IN

02:10:08.800 --> 02:10:10.402
WASHINGTON STATE BUT ALSO OF THE

02:10:10.469 --> 02:10:12.371
RESEARCH THAT'S BEEN DONE ON THE

02:10:12.437 --> 02:10:13.438
STATE OF WASHINGTON USING THE

02:10:13.505 --> 02:10:15.574
OUR STATE. SO NOW GIVEN THEY

02:10:15.641 --> 02:10:17.242
HAVE OUR STATE AND WE NOW KNOW A

02:10:17.309 --> 02:10:18.744
LOT OF IMPORTANT THINGS ABOUT

02:10:18.810 --> 02:10:20.345
THE STATE OF WASHINGTON. THAT

02:10:20.412 --> 02:10:21.380
I'D LOVE TO KNOW ABOUT

02:10:21.446 --> 02:10:23.182
CALIFORNIA BUT WE CAN'T DO THAT

02:10:23.248 --> 02:10:24.183
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE OUR STATE

02:10:24.249 --> 02:10:26.051
OUT AND IT LOOKS LIKE. IT WOULD

02:10:26.118 --> 02:10:29.621
ACTUALLY BE RELATIVELY STRAIGHT

02:10:29.688 --> 02:10:31.723
FORWARD TO- COLLECT. VERY

02:10:31.790 --> 02:10:33.058
INTERESTING AND I SUPPOSE

02:10:33.125 --> 02:10:34.660
CONTACT WITH THE STATE OF

02:10:34.726 --> 02:10:35.694
WASHINGTON OR OREGON COULD GIVE

02:10:35.761 --> 02:10:38.363
US SOME. FINANCIAL DATA ON THE

02:10:38.430 --> 02:10:40.098
COST OF ANY SYSTEMS.

02:10:40.165 --> 02:10:41.833
MODIFICATIONS THAT THOSE STATES

02:10:41.900 --> 02:10:43.235
HAD TO GO THROUGH IN ORDER TO

02:10:43.302 --> 02:10:46.271
CONVENTIONALLY EXPAND THE- THE

02:10:46.338 --> 02:10:49.474
BASE WAGE BASE WAGE FILE. I

02:10:49.541 --> 02:10:51.777
THINK SO AND I THINK- YOU KNOW

02:10:51.843 --> 02:10:53.579
THERE THERE ARE EXISTING.

02:10:53.645 --> 02:10:55.681
NETWORKS AND RAMIFICATIONS SUCH

02:10:55.747 --> 02:10:58.016
AS YOU KNOW DR SAXONS NETWORKS

HALF TO DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND-

02:11:04.690 --> 02:11:06.625
