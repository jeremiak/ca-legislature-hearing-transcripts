TRIMS TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY

00:28:30.608 --> 00:28:32.277
UNDER THE CURRENT THE THOUGHT

00:28:32.343 --> 00:28:34.579

00:28:48.927 --> 00:28:50.662
DO NOT HAVE THE SAME ACCESS TO

TOOLS THAT OTHER FARMERS WITHIN

00:28:53.098 --> 00:28:55.100
THE COUNTRY HAVE HI WHILE WE

00:28:55.166 --> 00:28:56.501
HAVE A VERY ROBUST DEPARTMENT

00:28:56.568 --> 00:28:59.003
OF PESTICIDE REGULATION- THAT

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:00.605
ROBUSTNESS IN THOSE RULES

00:29:00.672 --> 00:29:02.540
REALLY RESTRICT WHAT PRODUCTS

00:29:02.607 --> 00:29:04.209
INCOME TO OF THE MARKET. THAT

00:29:04.275 --> 00:29:06.244
NUMBER OF BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS

UNDER NUMBER GREENER PRODUCTS

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:09.781
QUOTE UNQUOTE SAFETY- SAFER

00:29:09.848 --> 00:29:12.016
PRODUCTS ARE BEING UTILIZED IN

00:29:12.083 --> 00:29:14.119
ALL OTHER AREAS OF THE COUNTRY

00:29:14.185 --> 00:29:15.954
THAT ARE NOT BEING UTILIZED.

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:17.455
BECAUSE ADDITION. BRING THE

BRING PRODUCTS TO THE MARKET.

00:29:20.992 --> 00:29:22.660
AND SO WITHOUT THOSE OTHER

00:29:22.727 --> 00:29:24.462
AVAILABLE TOOLS WE DO SEE THE

00:29:24.529 --> 00:29:26.131
OPPORTUNITY THAT WHEN A MISTAKE

00:29:26.197 --> 00:29:29.033

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:29.434
THAT THEY COULD BE

CONTROL HERE AND I KNOW I

00:33:53.798 --> 00:33:55.333
SERVED IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT BUT

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:57.735
I KNOW MANY OF US DID- I ALWAYS

00:33:57.802 --> 00:33:59.270
KIND OF RESENTED IT WHEN THE

00:33:59.337 --> 00:34:01.005
STATE CAME IN AND TOLD ME THAT

00:34:01.072 --> 00:34:02.940
I WE WERE DOING. OF THE STATE

CONTROL AND I'M WONDERING

00:34:04.709 --> 00:34:06.844
THOUGH IS THAT WHY YOU'RE DOING

00:34:06.911 --> 00:34:09.080
THIS BECAUSE WE FOR THE LOCAL

00:34:09.147 --> 00:34:10.915

SEEMS. YOU KNOW WHERE WHERE IS

00:34:16.888 --> 00:34:19.223
THE OVERRIDING REASON WHY. DPR

00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:20.124
NEEDS TO COME AND TAKE THIS

00:34:20.191 --> 00:34:21.793

BOTH FOR BEING HERE AND IN IN

00:34:26.097 --> 00:34:28.299
MANY DISCUSSIONS WITH THE ACT.

00:34:28.366 --> 00:34:28.933
THERE ISN'T VERY CLOSE TO THEM.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.835
BUT YOU KNOW TIME IT I MEAN WE

00:34:30.902 --> 00:34:32.503
DIDN'T GET TO THE LANGUAGE BUT

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:33.337
I. THINK I'M ALSO CONFIDENT

00:34:33.404 --> 00:34:36.007
WE'LL GET BASE WHERE THE

00:34:36.073 --> 00:34:37.675
COUNTRY. SO I KNOW MEANS. AWAY

00:34:37.742 --> 00:34:38.576
FROM THEM. I MEAN THAT'S THE

00:34:38.643 --> 00:34:39.544
GOAL. THEY WOULD BE THIS

00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:41.512
CLUSTER. OFF I BELIEVE IF WE

00:34:41.579 --> 00:34:42.847
WERE. BUT YOU CAN SPEAK FOR

00:34:42.914 --> 00:34:45.850
ITSELF AND BUT I THINK THAT

00:34:45.917 --> 00:34:47.885
THAT THE NASA SAYS HE DOES

00:34:47.952 --> 00:34:49.687
COMES IN A COUPLE WAYS WHAT IS.

00:34:49.754 --> 00:34:51.956
SOMETIMES WE HAVE GROUP.

00:34:52.023 --> 00:34:52.557
SECTION BUT AS YOU CAN IMAGINE

00:34:52.623 --> 00:34:53.124
WITH A SPRAY. AND IN THOSE

00:34:53.191 --> 00:34:54.425
CASES MAKING SURE THAT IS AN

00:34:54.492 --> 00:34:55.726
AUTHORITY THAT CAN DO IT. MAKES

00:34:55.793 --> 00:34:57.395
SENSE BUT ALSO WHERE THE COUNTY

00:34:57.462 --> 00:34:58.863
COMMISSIONERS. ARE FOR WHATEVER

00:34:58.930 --> 00:34:59.864
REASON CONFLICTED OUT OR

00:34:59.931 --> 00:35:01.499
OTHERWISE IF THEY'RE NOT.

00:35:01.566 --> 00:35:04.035
APPROPRIATE AND HEATED DUET

00:35:04.101 --> 00:35:06.070
THIS GIVES. DEEP TO DO IT IN

00:35:06.137 --> 00:35:07.338
LIEU OF THAT BUT THE LANGUAGE

00:35:07.405 --> 00:35:08.806
THAT WE ARE CLOSE TO ADDING.

00:35:08.873 --> 00:35:10.408
YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE IT THERE

00:35:10.475 --> 00:35:10.942
SO I CAN'T GIVE YOU EXACT

00:35:11.008 --> 00:35:13.177
LANGUAGE BUT- RELATES THIS KIND

00:35:13.244 --> 00:35:16.013
OF COLLABORATION AN AGREEMENT

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:16.647
BETWEEN THE LOCAL AUTHORITY AND

00:35:16.714 --> 00:35:18.049
IF YOU ARE THAT THEY ARE THE

00:35:18.115 --> 00:35:19.717
APPROPRIATE. ENTITY TO DO IT.

00:35:19.784 --> 00:35:21.519
LOOKING TO. AS WE MOVE FORWARD

00:35:21.586 --> 00:35:22.687
OKAY BUT THAT'S A REALLY.

00:35:22.753 --> 00:35:24.622
IMPORTANT YEAH I THINK. BECAUSE

00:35:24.689 --> 00:35:26.591
IF THE PR IS GONNA TAKE OVER AN

00:35:26.657 --> 00:35:28.526
INVESTIGATION. I THINK IT THAT

00:35:28.593 --> 00:35:29.894
HAS TO BE THE REASON. YEAH THAT

00:35:29.961 --> 00:35:30.962
THAT BECAUSE IT'S MULTI

00:35:31.028 --> 00:35:32.230
JURISDICTIONAL. BUT THEY'RE THE

00:35:32.296 --> 00:35:34.499
MOST. CREATION AND THAT I THINK

00:35:34.565 --> 00:35:37.401
WOULD REQUIRE. ROB OF THE

00:35:37.468 --> 00:35:39.604
AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONERS. ON

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:41.572
A LOCAL LEVEL SO. I'M GLAD TO

00:35:41.639 --> 00:35:42.840
HEAR YOU SAY THAT- I'LL BE IN

00:35:42.907 --> 00:35:43.941
OPPOSITION TO THE BILL TODAY

00:35:44.008 --> 00:35:46.344
BUT- THAT COULD CHANGE. IF AND

WE DON'T KNOW YET HOW MANY

00:49:10.881 --> 00:49:12.849
REPLACEMENT FAUCETS WILL BEING

NEED TO REPLACE THEIR FAUCET

00:49:15.285 --> 00:49:18.388
SCHOOLS TO DATE HAVE ABOUT 18%

00:49:18.455 --> 00:49:21.458
OF THE FOSTER TESTED AT SCHOOLS

00:49:21.525 --> 00:49:22.559
HAVE HAD TO BE REPLACED- SOME

00:49:22.626 --> 00:49:24.428
SPECULATION THAT WE COULD BE

00:49:24.494 --> 00:49:26.930
LOOKING AT AM ARM NUMBER FOR

00:49:26.997 --> 00:49:28.565
CHILD CARE. I DON'T KNOW THAT.

00:49:28.632 --> 00:49:31.201
WHAT WE DO KNOW IS ON BASED NSF

00:49:31.268 --> 00:49:34.037
TASTE TESTING. THAT

00:49:34.104 --> 00:49:36.173
APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED WELL

00:49:36.239 --> 00:49:38.208
UPDATED IT TESTING THEY TESTED

00:49:38.275 --> 00:49:39.409
ABOUT APPROXIMATE FIVE HUNDRED

00:49:39.476 --> 00:49:41.578
FAUCETS. FOR THEIR LEACHING

00:49:41.645 --> 00:49:45.549
VALUE AND FOUND THAT 73% OF THE

00:49:45.615 --> 00:49:48.385
TO THOSE TESTS SHOWED THAT THE

00:49:48.452 --> 00:49:51.121
FAUCETS. HAD ON THE- BEACH THE

00:49:51.188 --> 00:49:53.156
LEAST AMOUNT UNDER THE- UNDER

00:49:53.223 --> 00:49:55.559
THE ONE MICROGRAM. PER LITER OF

00:49:55.625 --> 00:49:58.228
LEAD WHICH IS THE KEY WHAT ONE

00:49:58.295 --> 00:50:01.431
WHICH- TECHNICAL I KNOW BUT-

00:50:01.498 --> 00:50:04.000
AND BASED ON THE STING. WE

00:50:04.067 --> 00:50:07.404
PROJECT AT ABOUT 252725% OF THE

00:50:07.471 --> 00:50:09.373
FAUCETS ON THE MARKET TODAY

00:50:09.439 --> 00:50:10.874
EVEN THOUGH THEY MEET THE

00:50:10.941 --> 00:50:13.677
CONTENT STANDARD FOR LAD THAT

00:50:13.744 --> 00:50:15.412
IS YOU KNOW THE METAL STATE.

00:50:15.479 --> 00:50:17.414
THEY'RE PERFECT AND HEARD THE

00:50:17.481 --> 00:50:18.615
MOUNT THAT THE LEECH IS

00:50:18.682 --> 00:50:19.850
ACTUALLY GOING TO BE IT'S MORE

00:50:19.916 --> 00:50:22.886
THAN- THE QUEUE OF ONE AND IN

00:50:22.953 --> 00:50:25.155
SOME CASES MUCH HIGHER AND TOM

00:50:25.222 --> 00:50:27.724
WHO HAS. GREAT HAS STUDY THOSE

00:50:27.791 --> 00:50:29.426
THOSE TESTS COULD PROBABLY

00:50:29.493 --> 00:50:32.229
EXPLAIN THAT MORE. WELL I THINK

00:50:32.295 --> 00:50:33.697
MY POINT IS I'M HAPPY TO

00:50:33.764 --> 00:50:35.165
SUPPORT THIS MEASURE TODAY AND

00:50:35.232 --> 00:50:36.767
I THINK THIS IS A ANOTHER

00:50:36.833 --> 00:50:38.735
POSITIVE STEP FORWARD THERE'S

00:50:38.802 --> 00:50:40.570
NO AMOUNT OF LEAD THAT SAFE FOR

00:50:40.637 --> 00:50:43.507
CHILDREN. AND SO WHY ARE THESE

00:50:43.573 --> 00:50:45.409
FAUCET IN THE MARKET. IF THEY

00:50:45.475 --> 00:50:47.077
HAVE A NUMBER WHICH IS HIGHER

00:50:47.144 --> 00:50:48.812
AND SO THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING

00:50:48.879 --> 00:50:51.415
TO UNDERSTAND. WHY IS A QUARTER

00:50:51.481 --> 00:50:54.518
OF THE MARKET STILL. LEACHING

00:50:54.584 --> 00:50:56.286
LEAD AT A LEVEL THAT'S

00:50:56.353 --> 00:50:57.854
DETECTABLE WHEN THERE'S NO

00:50:57.921 --> 00:51:00.190
STATE FROM FOR KIDS. AND SO

00:51:00.257 --> 00:51:01.858
THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO

00:51:01.925 --> 00:51:03.593
REALLY DIG INTO AND FIGURE OUT

00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:05.662
AND MAYBE YEAH MY APPROPRIATE

00:51:05.729 --> 00:51:07.397
PLACE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION

00:51:07.464 --> 00:51:09.433
BUT- FELT LIKE IT WAS A POOR.

00:51:09.499 --> 00:51:13.003
BUT THE DIAL SURE SURE. BUT

00:51:13.069 --> 00:51:15.238
THERE. THERE MIGHT BE SOME IN

00:51:15.305 --> 00:51:16.673
TERMS OF THE STUDY THAT WAS

00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:18.842
CONDUCTED AND OVER ENGAGE IN

00:51:18.909 --> 00:51:20.744
THAT CONVERSATION WITH NSF AND

00:51:20.811 --> 00:51:22.746
THE STUFF OF WHICH THEY WERE

00:51:22.813 --> 00:51:24.881
HERE AT THE TABLE AS THE

00:51:24.948 --> 00:51:25.515
INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY SORT OF

00:51:25.582 --> 00:51:28.118
OUR WHAT- I'M- PLAYING IT I

00:51:28.185 --> 00:51:30.387
THINK A RECESSION WAS THAT WHEN

00:51:30.454 --> 00:51:32.956
YOU Q. VALUE ONE IT'S THERE'S A

00:51:33.023 --> 00:51:34.925
RANGE THAT'S THE TO THERE'S

00:51:34.991 --> 00:51:38.028
ONLY. FIGHT TO SO IT'S NOT THAT

00:51:38.094 --> 00:51:39.095
MARKETED. YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT

00:51:39.162 --> 00:51:41.031
MARKETED AT THAT LEVEL BUT IT'S

00:51:41.097 --> 00:51:43.467
WHAT THEY THOUGHT THEY FOUND.

00:51:43.533 --> 00:51:45.302
IN THE TESTING THAT OF DEAD BUT

00:51:45.368 --> 00:51:47.103
THEY SAID IT'S BEING TAKEN OUT

00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:49.406
OF CONTEXT TO SAY THAT THERE'S

00:51:49.473 --> 00:51:50.507
THAT MUCH COMPLY THAT THERE'S

00:51:50.574 --> 00:51:51.208
THAT PERCENTAGE OF INDUSTRY

00:51:51.274 --> 00:51:53.210
COMPLY. THE SECOND IS THERE IS

00:51:53.276 --> 00:51:54.411
ACT. I THINK IT'S A PLUMBING

00:51:54.478 --> 00:51:55.879
BUT SECTIONS. FORTY ONE OF

00:51:55.946 --> 00:51:57.113
TITLE TWENTY FOUR THE ACTUALLY

00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:58.582
PUTS THE CURRENT AND A SUB

00:51:58.648 --> 00:52:01.751
STANDARD IN THERE AND THEN. WE

00:52:01.818 --> 00:52:02.752
TO WE'RE LOOKING AT LEACH RATE

00:52:02.819 --> 00:52:04.588
SUPPOSED CON. SO THEY'RE

00:52:04.654 --> 00:52:08.158
DIFFERENT MEASURE OF. PLACE WE-

00:52:08.225 --> 00:52:11.361
BUT WITH SO. WHAT UP THERE

00:52:11.428 --> 00:52:12.896
SHOULD BE SAFE IF NOT SO FOR

00:52:12.963 --> 00:52:14.331
THE- WE HAVE TO DO SOME ABOUT

00:52:14.397 --> 00:52:16.199
IT THE- YOU KNOW WE DO WE NOT

00:52:16.266 --> 00:52:18.034
WE DO NOT A- THAT. IF YOU WERE

00:52:18.101 --> 00:52:18.902
TO REPLACE A FAULT IN THIS

00:52:18.969 --> 00:52:20.403
TODAY THAT YOU CAN GET A HIGHER

00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:21.838
LEVEL THAN A TWENTY FIVE YEAR

00:52:21.905 --> 00:52:22.739
OLD FAUCET. NO JUST LOOK AT

00:52:22.806 --> 00:52:24.541
THAT THE I THINK IT'S HEALTH

00:52:24.608 --> 00:52:26.576
AND SAFETY CODE ONE SIXTY NEED

00:52:26.643 --> 00:52:27.344
SEVENTY FIVE STATUS IN TWO

00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:28.512
THOUSAND SIX. DODGE IS A

00:52:28.578 --> 00:52:30.280
MAXIMUM. OF FOUR MORE FOR THE

00:52:30.347 --> 00:52:31.681
MAXIM LEAD CONTENT IN ANY

00:52:31.748 --> 00:52:33.650
FAUCET. SO THE NEW FALL TO THE

00:52:33.717 --> 00:52:38.955
UP LEACH. THE LITTLE FAUCET IS

00:52:39.022 --> 00:52:42.792
NOT A TITLE. DURATION. OKAY

00:52:42.859 --> 00:52:45.762
MIKE. I COULD ADD THAT. WITH WE

00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:47.297
DID TESTING IN CHILDCARE

00:52:47.364 --> 00:52:49.132
CENTERS. AND WE FOUND THAT

00:52:49.199 --> 00:52:51.034
INDEED SOME OF THEM WE ACTUALLY

00:52:51.101 --> 00:52:52.669
HAD MEMBERS THAT WENT OFF THAT

00:52:52.736 --> 00:52:55.171
WAY HI AFTER WE REPLACE THE

00:52:55.238 --> 00:52:58.208
FAUCET. MOST OF THE BOSSES WERE

00:52:58.275 --> 00:52:59.576
IN GOOD SHAPE WE'RE TRYING TO

00:52:59.643 --> 00:53:01.244
FIGURE OUT A WAY TO IDENTIFY

00:53:01.311 --> 00:53:04.915
THE THAT PERFORM WELL VERSUS

00:53:04.981 --> 00:53:09.553
ONES THAT. HELLO I ACTUALLY

00:53:09.619 --> 00:53:10.053
LIKE TO TUNNEL DOWN ON

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:10.787
SOMETHING THAT DOCTOR ROOM

00:53:10.854 --> 00:53:12.389
YOU'LL JUST JUST MENTIONED AND

00:53:12.455 --> 00:53:13.823
THAT'S THE YOU KNOW THIS

00:53:13.890 --> 00:53:15.458
DISCUSSION ABOUT OUR LEAD IN

00:53:15.525 --> 00:53:19.396
WATER BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW IT I

00:53:19.462 --> 00:53:20.497
THINK WE'RE UNIFIED OUR DESIRE

00:53:20.564 --> 00:53:21.865
TO MAKE SURE THAT CHILDREN ARE

00:53:21.932 --> 00:53:24.167
HARMED BUT IT'S ALSO.

00:53:24.234 --> 00:53:26.670
COMPLETELY WRONG SAY THAT

00:53:26.736 --> 00:53:27.237
ANYTHING COULD BE LEAD FREE

00:53:27.304 --> 00:53:28.638
FROM A LOCAL STANDPOINT OTHERS

00:53:28.705 --> 00:53:32.208
LET AT. THINGS WILL LEAD MY CAN

00:53:32.275 --> 00:53:32.709
CAUGHT BUDGET A VERY LOW

00:53:32.776 --> 00:53:36.146
CONCENTRATIONS IN A WEEK WE

00:53:36.212 --> 00:53:38.415
ENFORCE STANDARDS THAT SAY THAT

00:53:38.481 --> 00:53:40.717
NO HERE PART OF. FARM FULL

00:53:40.784 --> 00:53:42.352
KNOWN TO OUR FOR. WE DON'T. ANY

00:53:42.419 --> 00:53:43.787
MORE THAN YOU KNOW THE AMOUNT

00:53:43.853 --> 00:53:46.423
THAT'S NOT HARMFUL SO. MY

00:53:46.489 --> 00:53:48.325
QUESTION IS THEN. YOU KNOW THE

00:53:48.391 --> 00:53:50.126
CURRENT NATIONAL STANDARD IS

00:53:50.193 --> 00:53:51.461
ONE IS FIVE MICROGRAMS PER

00:53:51.528 --> 00:53:53.697
LITER. AND I WOULD LOOK FOR

00:53:53.763 --> 00:53:55.098
SOME PEER REVIEWED RESEARCH

00:53:55.165 --> 00:53:58.101
THAT SAYS THAT. ONE MICROGRAM

00:53:58.168 --> 00:53:59.302
PER LEADER IS SAFER FOR

00:53:59.369 --> 00:54:00.570
CHILDREN THAN FIVE MICROGRAMS

00:54:00.637 --> 00:54:02.038
PER LITER AND I COULDN'T FIND

00:54:02.105 --> 00:54:03.340
ANY SO I'M WONDERING IF THAT'S

00:54:03.406 --> 00:54:04.541
THAT HAS READ THAT RESEARCH

00:54:04.608 --> 00:54:05.942
BEEN DONE BECAUSE I WANNA MAKE

00:54:06.009 --> 00:54:07.210
SURE THAT WE'RE MAKE DECISIONS

00:54:07.277 --> 00:54:08.845
ON A- ON THE BASIS OF

00:54:08.912 --> 00:54:11.448
SCIENTIFIC. STUDY AND JUST

00:54:11.514 --> 00:54:14.918
AFTER. YEAH YOUR YOU'RE EXACTLY

00:54:14.985 --> 00:54:17.287
RIGHT THERE IS NO SAFE LEVEL IN

00:54:17.354 --> 00:54:18.622
OUR GOAL THAT WAS TO DRIVE THE

00:54:18.688 --> 00:54:20.423
LEVELS DOWN BECAUSE LET IS FOR

00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:21.791
BROWN JUST SITS IN THE SOIL

00:54:21.858 --> 00:54:23.560
IT'S IN THE PAINT. AND IT'S

00:54:23.627 --> 00:54:25.929
AND- IT'S IN THE WATER VICTIMS

00:54:25.996 --> 00:54:27.297
CAN I CHALLENGE YOU TO DO ON

00:54:27.364 --> 00:54:30.033
THAT THERE'S NO SAFE LEVEL.

00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:32.268
EXPO TO LEAD THAT WE'VE EVERY

00:54:32.335 --> 00:54:33.637
TIME WE'VE LOOKED WE FIND THAT

00:54:33.703 --> 00:54:35.705
THERE'S HAZARDS. TO CHILDREN

00:54:35.772 --> 00:54:37.507
AND EVEN TO ADULTS AT LOW

00:54:37.574 --> 00:54:40.977
LEVELS. THAT LOWER LOWER LOWER

00:54:41.044 --> 00:54:42.779
THAN FIVE MICROGRAMS PER LITER.

00:54:42.846 --> 00:54:45.548
YES YES OF MY CAN GIVE AN

00:54:45.615 --> 00:54:46.816
EXAMPLE IS FDA APPROVED DRUG

00:54:46.883 --> 00:54:48.718
ADMINISTRATION SAYS THAT THE

00:54:48.785 --> 00:54:50.253
MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF CHILD SHOULD

00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:52.822
BE EXPOSED TO IN A DAY IS THREE

00:54:52.889 --> 00:54:55.925
MICROGRAMS. WELL IN THAT FIRST

00:54:55.992 --> 00:54:57.560
QUARTER LEADER SAMPLE THAT THE

00:54:57.627 --> 00:55:00.130
SCHOOL STATE TAKE THAT'S THREE

00:55:00.196 --> 00:55:02.599
PARTS PER BILLION SO. JUST

00:55:02.666 --> 00:55:03.933
FIFTY IT'S IT WOULD EXCEED A

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.268
SINGLE SAMPLE THAT FIVE WOULD

00:55:05.335 --> 00:55:07.804
EXCEED FDA OR FTA ZONE IF THE

00:55:07.871 --> 00:55:09.773
CHILD DRANK A LITER OF WATER

00:55:09.839 --> 00:55:11.307
FROM THE FAUCET. WORTHY JUST

00:55:11.374 --> 00:55:12.575
DRINK A QUARTER LEADER OF WATER

00:55:12.642 --> 00:55:14.010
THAT HAD THAT FIGHT ON THAT

00:55:14.077 --> 00:55:16.379
AMOUNT IN IT- BECAUSE THE

00:55:16.446 --> 00:55:17.614
STANDARDS BASED ON FIVE

00:55:17.681 --> 00:55:21.284
MICROGRAMS OF LEAD IN A- IN

00:55:21.351 --> 00:55:24.754
THAT WATER THE CUT PASSES

00:55:24.821 --> 00:55:25.789
THROUGH THE FAUCET. THE ONES

00:55:25.855 --> 00:55:27.624
THAT WERE CERTIFIED. NINE

00:55:27.691 --> 00:55:29.559
MICROGRAMS IN THAT FIRST

00:55:29.626 --> 00:55:32.562
SAMPLE. SO MUCH HIGHER LEVEL

00:55:32.629 --> 00:55:33.163
SURE BUT I MEAN THE NATIONAL

00:55:33.229 --> 00:55:34.964
STANDARD IS FIVE. RIGHT SO THAT

00:55:35.031 --> 00:55:36.466
THAT THAT'S NOT COMPLIANT WITH

00:55:36.533 --> 00:55:38.168
THE CURRENT NATIONAL STANDAR

00:55:38.234 --> 00:55:39.102
IF IT AT THIRTY ONE MICROGRAMS

00:55:39.169 --> 00:55:40.437
BELIEVE WAS CERTIFIED UNDER THE

00:55:40.503 --> 00:55:42.172
CURRENT STAND. BECAUSE IT'S

00:55:42.238 --> 00:55:44.107
AVERAGED OVER THREE WEEKS OF.

00:55:44.174 --> 00:55:46.209
TESTING SO THE FOR VERY FIRST

00:55:46.276 --> 00:55:49.412
APPLES WERE THE NINE BUT THE OF

00:55:49.479 --> 00:55:52.182
MY DOWN QUICKLY RIGHT SO WITH

00:55:52.248 --> 00:55:55.885
AVERAGE TO BELOW. THE DOOR THE

00:55:55.952 --> 00:55:58.722
ONE WOULD MAKE IT. INTO THE-

00:55:58.788 --> 00:56:00.690
WOODS OUT THAT WAY. THAT THOSE

00:56:00.757 --> 00:56:02.625
FOSTER UNEXAMPLED THAT WOULD BE

00:56:02.692 --> 00:56:06.563
FREE TO I UNDERSTAND WHY AM I.

00:56:06.629 --> 00:56:07.363
YEAH I WANNA BE'S OF. BUT I

00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:07.897
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

00:56:07.964 --> 00:56:08.498
MAKING AND FOR TO. YEAH I'M TO

00:56:08.565 --> 00:56:10.467
SAY. THERE SHALL BE NO LEFT IN

00:56:10.533 --> 00:56:12.502
ANYTHING IS NOT. SOMETHING THAT

00:56:12.569 --> 00:56:13.903
WE'RE EVER GOING TO ACHIEVE AT

00:56:13.970 --> 00:56:15.271
AND I'M JUST A VERY CARDS

00:56:15.338 --> 00:56:17.373
BECAUSE WE'VE GOT OTHER. ISSUES

00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:18.241
THAT COME BEFORE THIS IS LIKE A

00:56:18.308 --> 00:56:20.009
HEXAVALENT CHROMIUM UNDER WATER

00:56:20.076 --> 00:56:20.944
WHICH IS NATURALLY OCCURRING

00:56:21.010 --> 00:56:22.445
DOESN'T HAVE BECOME FROM

00:56:22.512 --> 00:56:24.781
CONTAMINATION. AND TO SAY EVERY

00:56:24.848 --> 00:56:25.849
TIME THAT WE- ARE DETECTION

00:56:25.915 --> 00:56:27.951
TECHNOLOGY IMPROVES AND WE'RE

00:56:28.017 --> 00:56:30.153
GOING LOWER THE STANDARD. A BIT

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:32.188
IN EVIDENCE YOU KNOW IT IS NOT

00:56:32.255 --> 00:56:35.091
THE- TO. JUST BECAUSE WE ENDED.

00:56:35.158 --> 00:56:37.327
LEFT AT LOWER. DOESN'T KNOW.

00:56:37.393 --> 00:56:38.595
MEAN THAT THE STANDARD OF THE

00:56:38.661 --> 00:56:39.229
LAW SO IF YOU WOULD PLEASE IF

00:56:39.295 --> 00:56:41.564
YOU COULD- THEM FROM THAT THE

00:56:41.631 --> 00:56:42.932
STUDIES THAT YOU HAVE IF YOU

00:56:42.999 --> 00:56:44.267
CAN GET THOSE TOMORROW SO I

00:56:44.334 --> 00:56:45.001
COULD REVIEW MIGHT REALLY BE

00:56:45.068 --> 00:56:47.170
PURGED OF THE FIGHTER. OKAY

00:56:47.237 --> 00:56:49.172
THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER

00:56:49.239 --> 00:56:50.640
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. HAVE

00:56:50.707 --> 00:56:54.544
QUESTIONS COMMENTS. NO OKAY

00:56:54.611 --> 00:56:59.349
WELL. THANK YOU MISTER

00:56:59.415 --> 00:57:00.016
OBERNOLTE FOR POINTING OUT SOME

00:57:00.083 --> 00:57:01.651
OF THINGS THAT I WAS ACTUALLY

00:57:01.718 --> 00:57:02.852
THINKING BECAUSE I THINK IT IS

00:57:02.919 --> 00:57:04.754
DANGEROUS TO SUGGEST THAT

00:57:04.821 --> 00:57:09.125
THERE'S SOME- THAT THERE ARE.

00:57:09.192 --> 00:57:11.294
HIGH LEVELS OF LEAD THAT EXIST

00:57:11.361 --> 00:57:13.663
WHERE THEY MAY NOT ACTUALLY

00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:15.899
EXIST AND IT'S TRUE THAT.

00:57:15.965 --> 00:57:17.734
EXPOSURE TO LEAD IS NOT HEALTHY

00:57:17.801 --> 00:57:20.336
BUT WE DO HAVE LEAD IN VARIOUS

00:57:20.403 --> 00:57:23.506
FORMS IN OUR ENVIRONMENT

00:57:23.573 --> 00:57:27.043
WHETHER IT'S IN THE PIPES THAT

00:57:27.110 --> 00:57:27.710
ARE BRINGING OUR CHECKING WATER.

00:57:27.777 --> 00:57:29.312
OR IN THE BILL. I DON'T LIKE TO

00:57:29.379 --> 00:57:31.614
HEAR THINGS THAT SOUND ALARMIST

00:57:31.681 --> 00:57:32.816
BUT I THINK WE NEED TO BE

00:57:32.882 --> 00:57:34.784
CERTAINLY- CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT

00:57:34.851 --> 00:57:36.452
WE'RE ALLOWING OUR CHILDREN TO

00:57:36.519 --> 00:57:38.087
INGESTION YOU KNOW EVERYONE

00:57:38.154 --> 00:57:39.622
ELSE WHO'S EXPOSED TO IT AS

00:57:39.689 --> 00:57:43.526
WELL- MR HOLDEN I AM WONDERING

00:57:43.593 --> 00:57:48.398
IS THERE ANY PRIEST BUILT INTO

00:57:48.464 --> 00:57:50.834
THIS BILL TO ALLOW MANY FACTORS

00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:52.635
OF SEVENTIES POP THE ABILITY.

00:57:52.702 --> 00:57:55.305
OUT OF. THE INVENTORY THAT THEY

00:57:55.371 --> 00:57:58.141
HAVE IN REPLACE IT WITH

00:57:58.208 --> 00:58:00.643
INVENTORY THAT MEETS THE NEW.

00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:01.211
WHAT WILL LIKELY BE THE NEW

00:58:01.277 --> 00:58:03.646
STANDARD. WELL I THINK THAT THE

00:58:03.713 --> 00:58:05.815
REASON THERE'S A RECOGNITION

00:58:05.882 --> 00:58:07.684
THAT WERE THEY WE'VE BEEN

00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:09.319
DISCUSSING THE ISSUES IN GOOD

00:58:09.385 --> 00:58:11.054
FAITH IS TRYING TO GET TO A

00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:15.024
PLACE THIS TYPE OF CONCERNS CAN

00:58:15.091 --> 00:58:16.159
BE MITIGATED AT CONF AND THE

00:58:16.226 --> 00:58:19.462
RIGHT. SPOT IT SHOULD BE. BUT

00:58:19.529 --> 00:58:20.763
IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT

00:58:20.830 --> 00:58:22.599
AGREE SPIRIT OR EXIST IF THIS

00:58:22.665 --> 00:58:24.267
BILL PASSES AND IS IN A BIT

00:58:24.334 --> 00:58:26.769
SIGNED INTO LAW IS IT IMMEDIATE.

00:58:26.836 --> 00:58:29.005
WELL IN TERMS OF THE IF THAT'S

00:58:29.072 --> 00:58:30.273
ONE OF THE ISSUES IS ON THE

00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:31.641
TABLE I THINK THAT THAT'S THE

00:58:31.708 --> 00:58:33.443
BOOK THE GRACE PERIOD YES THESE

00:58:33.509 --> 00:58:34.611
ARE PART OF DISAGREEING WITH

00:58:34.677 --> 00:58:36.145
EVERYBODY THAT IN IT AND IF

00:58:36.212 --> 00:58:38.214
I'VE GOT IT RIGHT AS WELL. BUT

00:58:38.281 --> 00:58:39.315
THE LEGISLATURE CURRENTLY

00:58:39.382 --> 00:58:41.117
DRAFTED. THE COMMITTEE HAS

00:58:41.184 --> 00:58:41.985
pENOUGH IS SILENT ON THE

00:58:42.051 --> 00:58:43.453
EFFECTIVE DATE SO WOULD BE

00:58:43.519 --> 00:58:44.721
GENERALLY ONE TWENTY TWENTY

00:58:44.787 --> 00:58:46.222
ONE. BUT THE GOOD FAITH

00:58:46.289 --> 00:58:47.891
DISCUSSIONS SO FAR HAVE.

00:58:47.957 --> 00:58:50.693
FOCUSED ON A POTENTIAL JANUARY

00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:51.427
ONE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR.

00:58:51.494 --> 00:58:54.197
MANDATORY ALL PRODUCTS MUST

00:58:54.264 --> 00:58:56.900
MEET QW ONE. AND OUR INDUSTRY

00:58:56.966 --> 00:58:58.501
LEAVES THAT THAT WOULD PROVIDE

00:58:58.568 --> 00:59:01.604
SUFFICIENT TIME. OF FOUR BOB.

00:59:01.671 --> 00:59:02.906
IN GETTING TO MARKET THAT WOULD

00:59:02.972 --> 00:59:04.841
ALSO INCLUDE THE SO THAT WOULD

00:59:04.908 --> 00:59:05.975
BE ON THE SHELVES AT ALL THE

00:59:06.042 --> 00:59:07.677
HOME DEPOTS AND LOWS AND RIGHT

00:59:07.744 --> 00:59:09.646
AND SO THAT'S PART OF THAT DATE

00:59:09.712 --> 00:59:10.947
IS THAT CONSIDERATION WELL

00:59:11.014 --> 00:59:12.815
THAT'S AND THAT'S WERE WERE

00:59:12.882 --> 00:59:14.183
STILL IN. CONVERSATION TO GET

00:59:14.250 --> 00:59:15.818
TO THAT WHAT WE WILL BE THE

00:59:15.885 --> 00:59:18.087
RIGHT. SO IS THERE A CERTAIN

00:59:18.154 --> 00:59:21.691
POINT THE DATE OR IS A STICKING

00:59:21.758 --> 00:59:23.459
POINT FOR YOU JUST PUTTING A

00:59:23.526 --> 00:59:26.262
GRACE PERIOD IN PLACE AT ALL.

00:59:26.329 --> 00:59:27.030
WELL IN TERMS OF THE ISSUES

00:59:27.096 --> 00:59:29.032
THERE MAY BE. OTHER THINGS THAT

00:59:29.098 --> 00:59:30.867
WERE WORKING ON AND TRY TO TIE

00:59:30.934 --> 00:59:33.303
UP LOOSE ENDS ON BUT THAT

00:59:33.369 --> 00:59:33.803
CERTAIN THE ONE THAT YOU

00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:35.471
BROUGHT UP IS ONE OF THE- ITEMS

00:59:35.538 --> 00:59:37.674
THAT WE'RE- TRYING TO. PAY UP.

00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:40.310
THE COMMON GROUND. OKAY I ASK

00:59:40.376 --> 00:59:42.946
BECAUSE I COULD SUPPORT THE

00:59:43.012 --> 00:59:44.647
BILL IF I KNEW. THAT THEY WERE

00:59:44.714 --> 00:59:46.082
GOING TO BE SOMETHING IN PLACE

00:59:46.149 --> 00:59:48.351
AT ALL SEE INDUSTRY TO. ADAPT

00:59:48.418 --> 00:59:50.687
TO IN STANDARD AND NOT GET

00:59:50.753 --> 00:59:51.988
STUCK WITH INVENTORY THAT. KING

00:59:54.490 --> 00:59:55.692
ONE. TO IN A REPLACEMENT

00:59:55.758 --> 00:59:57.026
PRODUCTS ON THE SHELVES BUT

00:59:57.093 --> 00:59:58.962
THAT DOES TAKE TIME. TO RATHER

00:59:59.028 --> 01:00:00.863
THAN HIT THEM WITH THAT ALL AT

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:05.068
ONCE IT SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD BE.

01:00:05.134 --> 01:00:07.003
A MORE FAIR APPROACH TO I

01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:11.808
UNDERGRADUATE. AND I DON'T. YOU

IMPLEMENTING THE BILL WE

01:00:49.112 --> 01:00:49.679
