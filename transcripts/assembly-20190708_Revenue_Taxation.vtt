EXISTENTIAL CRISIS OF OUR TIME

00:37:40.324 --> 00:37:41.325
CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:37:41.392 --> 00:37:42.593
IT IS IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:44.261
THAT THIS MEASURE IS A STUDY

00:37:44.328 --> 00:37:45.830
BILL AS THE GOOD CENTER HAS SAID.

00:37:45.896 --> 00:37:46.731
MEANT TO PROVIDE THE STATE WITH

00:37:46.797 --> 00:37:48.432
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT MAY

00:37:48.499 --> 00:37:49.634
INFORM THE DISCUSSION ON HOW WE

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:51.102
COULD POTENTIALLY REDUCE

00:37:51.168 --> 00:37:52.637
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS EVEN

00:37:52.703 --> 00:37:53.537
FURTHER.

00:37:53.604 --> 00:37:55.106
SPECIFICALLY BY REQUIRING CARBS

00:37:55.172 --> 00:37:57.008
TO MAKE A DETERMINATION WHETHER

00:37:57.074 --> 00:37:58.609
THERE ARE FEASIBLE AND PRACTICAL

00:37:58.676 --> 00:37:59.910
MECHANISMS FOR ASSESSING AND

00:37:59.977 --> 00:38:00.911
ASSIGNING.

00:38:00.978 --> 00:38:02.313
CARBON INTENSITY TO RETAIL

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:05.950
PRODUCTS SUBJECTS TO THE CEILING

00:38:06.017 --> 00:38:06.917
USE TAX LAW.

00:38:06.984 --> 00:38:07.752
AT THIS POINT WE NEED ALL THE

00:38:07.818 --> 00:38:08.319
INFORMATION WE CAN GET TO

00:38:08.386 --> 00:38:09.253
UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN ADDRESS

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:11.022
CLIMATE CHANGE MOST EFFECTIVELY.

00:38:11.088 --> 00:38:12.223
THIS SHOULD INCLUDE EXAMINING

00:38:12.289 --> 00:38:13.424
THE SALES AND USE TAX AS A

00:38:13.491 --> 00:38:14.625
POTENTIAL MECHANISM.

00:38:14.692 --> 00:38:16.227
LAST FALL THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL

00:38:16.293 --> 00:38:17.895
PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE THE I.

00:38:17.962 --> 00:38:20.331
P. C. C. ISSUED A REPORT -- THAT

00:38:20.398 --> 00:38:20.831
I'M SURE MANY OF YOU ARE

00:38:20.898 --> 00:38:21.699
FAMILIAR WITH.

00:38:21.766 --> 00:38:23.668
HIGHLIGHTING THE GLOBAL URGENCY

00:38:23.734 --> 00:38:25.336
TO BECOME CARBON NEUTRAL IF NOT

00:38:25.403 --> 00:38:27.905
CARBON NEGATIVE BY MID CENTURY

00:38:27.972 --> 00:38:28.506
TO KEEP OVERALL TEMPERATURES

00:38:28.572 --> 00:38:29.607
FROM RISING.

00:38:29.674 --> 00:38:31.008
MORE THAN ONE POINT FIVE DEGREES

00:38:31.075 --> 00:38:32.977
CELSIUS THIS REPORT FOLLOW THE

00:38:33.044 --> 00:38:34.445
PARIS AGREEMENT WHERE COUNTRIES

00:38:34.512 --> 00:38:35.746
COMMITTED TO KEEP TEMPERATURES

00:38:35.813 --> 00:38:38.015
WELL BELOW TWO DEGREES CELSIUS.

00:38:38.082 --> 00:38:39.350
AS COMPARED TO PRE INDUSTRIAL

00:38:39.417 --> 00:38:41.318
TEMPERATURES. TO AVOID THE MOST

00:38:41.385 --> 00:38:42.720
CATASTROPHIC IMPACTS OF CLIMATE

00:38:42.787 --> 00:38:43.721
CHANGE.

00:38:43.788 --> 00:38:45.156
CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN AND WILL

00:38:45.222 --> 00:38:46.624
CONTINUE TO BE A LEADER ON THE

00:38:46.691 --> 00:38:48.426
CLIMATE FRONT BUT WE WILL NEED

00:38:48.492 --> 00:38:49.460
TO DO MORE IF WE WANT TO DO OUR

00:38:49.527 --> 00:38:51.429
PART. TO HELP ME NOT ONLY THE

00:38:51.495 --> 00:38:53.698
PARIS COMMITMENTS AND IPCC

00:38:53.764 --> 00:38:55.299
REPORT GUIDANCE.

00:38:55.366 --> 00:38:56.667
AT THE NATURE CONSERVANCY WE SEE

00:38:56.734 --> 00:38:58.769
SB FORTY THREE AS AN OPPORTUNITY

00:38:58.836 --> 00:39:00.571
TO UNDERSTAND TO THE VIABILITY

00:39:00.638 --> 00:39:01.172
AND EFFECTIVENESS OF ANOTHER

00:39:01.238 --> 00:39:02.006
TOOL.

00:39:02.073 --> 00:39:04.275
THIS TIME FOCUSED ON CONSUMERS

00:39:04.341 --> 00:39:05.776
TO HELP US IN THIS EFFORT AND

00:39:05.843 --> 00:39:06.510
REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS IN

00:39:06.577 --> 00:39:07.978
CALIFORNIA.

00:39:08.045 --> 00:39:08.746
AND POTENTIALLY OUTSIDE ITS

00:39:08.813 --> 00:39:09.747
BORDERS.

00:39:09.814 --> 00:39:10.881
WE ARE JST PART FOR THIS BILL

00:39:10.948 --> 00:39:11.816
SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHETHER

00:39:11.882 --> 00:39:14.185
CHANGES TO THE SALES AND USE TAX

00:39:14.251 --> 00:39:16.654
COULD BE PART OF THE SOLUTION

00:39:16.721 --> 00:39:17.021
THANKS FOR TIME.

00:39:17.088 --> 00:39:19.123
THANK YOU.

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:20.124
SO -- ACTING CHAIR AND MEMBERS

00:39:20.191 --> 00:39:21.058
OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS

00:39:21.125 --> 00:39:21.726
CHRISTINE SHOEMAKER I'M A

00:39:21.792 --> 00:39:22.893
RETIRED PLANT MOLECULAR

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.795
BIOLOGISTS IN A MEMBER OF THE

00:39:24.862 --> 00:39:26.630
BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF FOSSIL FOR

00:39:26.697 --> 00:39:27.431
CALIFORNIA.

00:39:27.498 --> 00:39:28.632
ALSO FOR CALIFORNIA'S A

00:39:28.699 --> 00:39:31.235
STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION HAS OVER

00:39:31.302 --> 00:39:32.670
SEVEN THOUSAND ONLINE SUPPORTERS

00:39:32.737 --> 00:39:34.972
WHICH WORKS TO LIMIT -- CLIMATE

00:39:35.039 --> 00:39:36.474
DAMAGING FOSSIL FUELS AND

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:40.077
PROMOTED JUST TRANSITION TO A

00:39:40.144 --> 00:39:42.246
LOW CARBON ECONOMY -- THIS BILL

00:39:42.313 --> 00:39:43.581
FITS WITH OUR MISSION THE

00:39:43.647 --> 00:39:45.316
PROBLEM CLIMATE CHANGE AS MY

00:39:45.382 --> 00:39:46.784
COLLEAGUE HAS SAID IS AN

00:39:46.851 --> 00:39:48.252
EXISTENTIAL THREAT.

00:39:48.319 --> 00:39:50.321
AND WE NEED -- FAST DRAWDOWNS

00:39:50.387 --> 00:39:52.790
AND A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH.

00:39:52.857 --> 00:39:54.091
IF WE'RE GOING TO GET TO A LOW

00:39:54.158 --> 00:39:56.360
CARBON ECONOMY WE NEED TO

00:39:56.427 --> 00:39:57.762
UNDERSTAND WHERE THE COMPANY IS

00:39:57.828 --> 00:39:59.230
IN THE ECONOMY.

00:39:59.296 --> 00:40:01.198
SO THE CARBON INTENSITY

00:40:01.265 --> 00:40:03.367
DETERMINATION -- IS THAT AND IT

00:40:03.434 --> 00:40:05.069
NEEDS TO BE CONSISTENT AND

00:40:05.136 --> 00:40:06.737
STANDARD AND ACCURATE.

00:40:06.804 --> 00:40:08.038
AND CARP HAS BASICALLY ALREADY

00:40:08.105 --> 00:40:10.040
DONE THIS ALREADY FOR THE FUELS

00:40:10.107 --> 00:40:11.642
IN THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD.

00:40:11.709 --> 00:40:13.644
SO IT FITS WITH THEIR EXPERTISE

00:40:13.711 --> 00:40:15.045
TO SEE IF IT'S FEASIBLE TO

00:40:15.112 --> 00:40:16.714
DETERMINE THE CARBON INTENSITY

00:40:16.781 --> 00:40:18.082
OF ALL THE PRODUCTS THAT ARE

00:40:18.149 --> 00:40:21.852
SUBJECT TO THE SALES AND USE TAX --

00:40:21.919 --> 00:40:23.287
WE THINK THAT PASSING THIS

00:40:23.354 --> 00:40:25.055
MESSAGE PASSING THIS ALL.

00:40:25.122 --> 00:40:26.423
ON BILL WOULD SEND A STRONG

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:28.659
MESSAGE TO MANUFACTURERS AND

00:40:28.726 --> 00:40:30.961
CONSUMERS ALIKE THAT THE CARBON

00:40:31.028 --> 00:40:33.030
TEN CITY OF PRODUCTS -- MADE

00:40:33.097 --> 00:40:35.366
SOLD AND BOUGHT IN CALIFORNIA

00:40:35.432 --> 00:40:38.636
ARE IMPORTANT TO THE STATE AND

00:40:38.702 --> 00:40:39.737
THEY FIT WITH THE STATE'S OF

00:40:39.804 --> 00:40:40.971
GOALS.

00:40:41.038 --> 00:40:42.807
ADDITIONALLY -- IF IT CAME BACK

00:40:42.873 --> 00:40:44.375
THAT THIS WAS FEASIBLE THEN THE

00:40:44.441 --> 00:40:45.609
NEXT STEP WOULD BE VERY

00:40:45.676 --> 00:40:47.044
IMPORTANT THAT WOULD BE.

00:40:47.111 --> 00:40:48.712
DETERMINING CARBON INTENSITY FOR

00:40:48.779 --> 00:40:50.014
A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:51.415
OUT THERE IS SOMETHING THAT'S

00:40:51.482 --> 00:40:53.050
DEFINITELY NEEDED INFORMATION

00:40:53.117 --> 00:40:54.251
THAT WOULD BE GOOD BOTH FOR THE

00:40:54.318 --> 00:40:55.586
MANUFACTURERS.

00:40:55.653 --> 00:40:59.857
AND THE CONSUMERS -- IF OF IT

00:40:59.924 --> 00:41:01.192
WOULD BE USEFUL FOR CONSUMERS

00:41:01.258 --> 00:41:03.227
LEGISLATORS AND REGULATORS ALIKE

00:41:03.294 --> 00:41:05.162
TO UNDERSTAND AND MAKE BETTER

00:41:05.229 --> 00:41:08.465
AND SMARTER ENVIRONMENTAL

00:41:08.532 --> 00:41:09.366
DECISIONS.

00:41:09.433 --> 00:41:10.367
AND WE WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE

00:41:10.434 --> 00:41:11.735
PUBLIC AS WELL SO WHAT WE URGE

00:41:11.802 --> 00:41:13.237
AN AYE VOTE ON THIS BECAUSE WE

00:41:13.304 --> 00:41:16.140
DO FEEL THAT -- TO MEASURE WE

00:41:16.207 --> 00:41:18.609
NEED TO MEASURE AND LIMIT CARBON

00:41:18.676 --> 00:41:20.444
LIKE OUR PLANET DEPENDS ON IT.

00:41:20.511 --> 00:41:22.580
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU

WHEN AMAZON MARKETPLACE SELLERS

00:42:03.387 --> 00:42:04.555
ARE FACTORY AND THE TOTAL

00:42:04.622 --> 00:42:06.757
PRODUCT COUNT THIS IS SEPARATE

00:42:06.824 --> 00:42:08.125
ES QUE USE?

RETAIL.

00:42:15.666 --> 00:42:18.102
HOW CAN WE POSSIBLY [inaudible]

00:42:18.168 --> 00:42:24.708
DETERMINE -- THE CARBON CONTENT.

00:42:24.775 --> 00:42:28.512
FOR HALF A BILLION PRODUCTS.

00:42:28.579 --> 00:42:30.347
YOU KNOW WE WE TRY OUR BEST I

00:42:30.414 --> 00:42:31.849
MEAN -- IN THE END OF THE DAY --

00:42:31.916 --> 00:42:33.951
THIS IS ABOUT.

00:42:34.018 --> 00:42:36.086
REALIZING THE FACT THAT WE'VE

00:42:36.153 --> 00:42:37.221
GOT AN EXISTENTIAL CRISIS ON OUR

00:42:37.288 --> 00:42:39.423
HANDS WHOM IS CHALLENGE.

00:42:39.490 --> 00:42:41.959
AND THEN -- AND THEN BASICALLY

00:42:42.026 --> 00:42:43.360
TASKING A GROUP THAT HAS BEEN

00:42:43.427 --> 00:42:44.762
WORKING REALLY INTENSELY IN THIS

00:42:44.828 --> 00:42:46.297
AREA FOR A LONG TIME.

00:42:46.363 --> 00:42:48.565
WITH -- WITH THE WITH A

00:42:48.632 --> 00:42:51.602
RESPONSIBILITY IN A ROLE TO TO

00:42:51.669 --> 00:42:52.436
TO TO TRY ITS BEST.

00:42:52.503 --> 00:42:54.838
AND AS I SAY IF THEY COME BACK

00:42:54.905 --> 00:42:57.241
WITH A WITH A MECHANISM OR THEY

00:42:57.308 --> 00:42:58.475
IF THEY SAY THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE

00:42:58.542 --> 00:42:59.677
IT'S ON FEASIBLE.

00:42:59.743 --> 00:43:00.811
WE WALK AWAY FROM THE ISSUE WE

00:43:00.878 --> 00:43:02.813
DON'T PURSUE IT FURTHER BUT I DO

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:05.516
THINK THAT -- THERE ARE LOTS OF

00:43:05.582 --> 00:43:07.518
DIFFERENT IF YOU LOOK AT AT ALL

00:43:07.584 --> 00:43:09.286
SORTS OF PRICING MECHANISMS OF

00:43:09.353 --> 00:43:10.454
YOU LOOK YOU LOOK AT THE VA T.

00:43:10.521 --> 00:43:11.588
SYSTEM IN EUROPE I MEAN IF YOU

00:43:11.655 --> 00:43:12.856
WOULD HAVE FIRST SUGGESTED DOING

00:43:12.923 --> 00:43:14.124
THAT THAT WAS SOUNDED PRETTY

00:43:14.191 --> 00:43:15.459
COUPLE NOTED THE V. A. T. IS

00:43:15.526 --> 00:43:16.593
JUST VALUE ADDED.

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:18.796
YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S ADDED

00:43:18.862 --> 00:43:21.332
EACH DAY H. PRICES QUITE A

00:43:21.398 --> 00:43:21.565
PROCESS.

00:43:21.632 --> 00:43:23.200
WITH [inaudible]

00:43:23.267 --> 00:43:24.201
YEAH [inaudible]

00:43:24.268 --> 00:43:26.804
SO -- WE WE WE WE WE WE

00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:28.706
BASICALLY TASK THEM WITH WITH

00:43:28.772 --> 00:43:30.207
TAKING A LONG HARD LOOK AT THIS.

00:43:30.274 --> 00:43:32.142
AND THEY'LL BE LOOKING AT MODELS

00:43:32.209 --> 00:43:33.110
ALL OVER THE WORLD -- YOU KNOW

00:43:33.177 --> 00:43:34.244
NETHERLANDS HAVE BEEN WORKING IN

00:43:34.311 --> 00:43:35.412
THIS AREA [inaudible]

00:43:35.479 --> 00:43:37.948
AND AND THEY COME BACK TO US

00:43:38.015 --> 00:43:39.783
WITH WITH THIS WITH WITH A

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:41.952
SERIES OF FINDINGS WELL.

00:43:42.019 --> 00:43:44.254
LET ME JUST SAY MY SON DID HIS

00:43:44.321 --> 00:43:45.990
THESIS WORK.

00:43:46.056 --> 00:43:49.893
ON LEDS VERSUS FLUORESCENT BULBS

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:52.329
AND LOOKING AT THE LIFE CYCLE.

00:43:52.396 --> 00:43:53.697
THAT TOOK MONTHS OF WORK.

00:43:53.764 --> 00:43:54.832
AND NOW YOU'VE GOT HALF A

00:43:54.898 --> 00:43:56.367
BILLION PRODUCTS AYE AYE

00:43:56.433 --> 00:43:58.402
PERMISSION TO USE.

00:43:58.469 --> 00:44:00.337
A PROP WITHOUT OBJECTION ALL

00:44:00.404 --> 00:44:03.374
RIGHT SO THE ISSUE IS CURRENTLY

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:04.942
MADE IN THE U. S..

00:44:05.009 --> 00:44:08.145
SHOULD SHOULD THE THE

00:44:08.212 --> 00:44:09.513
MANUFACTURER DECIDED TO

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:11.048
OUTSOURCE TO CHINA [inaudible]

00:44:11.115 --> 00:44:12.383
OR MALAYSIA [inaudible]

00:44:12.449 --> 00:44:15.619
OR BOTH -- IT'LL HAVE A VERY

00:44:15.686 --> 00:44:17.021
DIFFERENT CARBON FOOTPRINT I

00:44:17.087 --> 00:44:18.055
JUST DON'T THINK THIS IS

00:44:18.122 --> 00:44:19.790
PRACTICAL.

00:44:19.857 --> 00:44:21.392
GO AHEAD THROUGH THE CHAIR I I I

00:44:21.458 --> 00:44:24.261
WILL SAY -- THAT THE BILL.

00:44:24.328 --> 00:44:25.529
CALLS ON IDENTIFYING CERTAIN

00:44:25.596 --> 00:44:27.398
GROUPS OF PRODUCTS THAT WOULD

00:44:27.464 --> 00:44:29.299
ELIMINATE THE MOST EMISSIONS SO

00:44:29.366 --> 00:44:32.002
SO IT IT IS VERY LIKELY TO BE

00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:32.436
HONEST.

00:44:32.503 --> 00:44:34.438
THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE

00:44:34.505 --> 00:44:36.774
SMALLER ITEMS THAT WERE LOOKED

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:39.176
AT THE WOULD JUST DESCRIBE WHAT

00:44:39.243 --> 00:44:39.743
WOULD WOULD BE COVERED VERY

00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:42.446
DIFFERENTLY -- MAYBE THERE'D BE

00:44:42.513 --> 00:44:43.614
A ANY A LOOK AT THE AT THE

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:45.149
CARBON FOOTPRINT ASSOCIATED WITH

00:44:45.215 --> 00:44:48.986
DISTRIBUTION -- BUT BY.

00:44:49.053 --> 00:44:51.021
THE BILL BUT BUT THE BILL I I

00:44:51.088 --> 00:44:51.655
ANTICIPATES WHAT YOU'RE TALKING

00:44:51.722 --> 00:44:54.291
ABOUT NOT EXPECTING THE AIRPORT

00:44:54.358 --> 00:44:54.858
TO GO INTO EVERY [inaudible]

00:44:54.925 --> 00:44:58.629
SMALL ITEM --IT'S ABOUT TRYIN

00:44:58.695 --> 00:44:59.563
TO MOVE THE MOVE THE NEEDLE.

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:01.765
MON THE MACRO LEVEL RELATING TO

00:45:01.832 --> 00:45:02.766
CARBON INTENT SO THE DID THE

00:45:02.833 --> 00:45:04.368
QUESTION ABOUT THE CARBON

00:45:04.435 --> 00:45:08.505
FOOTPRINT OF ETHANOL FOR USE IN

00:45:08.572 --> 00:45:09.606
VEHICLES.

00:45:09.673 --> 00:45:12.142
HAS BEEN DEBATED FOR YEARS IT'S

00:45:12.209 --> 00:45:14.945
STILL THE SUBJECT OF LAWSUITS.

00:45:15.012 --> 00:45:16.613
I JUST DON'T SEE HOW THIS CAN BE

00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:18.382
DONE.

00:45:18.449 --> 00:45:20.584
IF SOME IF YOU ARE YOU ONE OF

00:45:20.651 --> 00:45:22.086
YOUR EXPERTS WOULD LIKE.

00:45:22.152 --> 00:45:23.487
TO ANSWER I I JUST DON'T SEE WAY

00:45:23.554 --> 00:45:26.423
TO DO IT.

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:28.092
WELL I WOULD DO DID YOU WANT TO

00:45:28.158 --> 00:45:29.860
I MEAN I I WOULD SAY THAT WE TRY

00:45:29.927 --> 00:45:31.295
OUR BEST WITH ALL THESE KINDS OF

00:45:31.361 --> 00:45:32.296
THINGS RIGHT I MEAN HOW YOU KNOW

00:45:32.362 --> 00:45:34.264
THAT THEIR THERE ARE ALL SORTS

00:45:34.331 --> 00:45:35.365
OF ESTIMATES THAT WE USE.

00:45:35.432 --> 00:45:37.234
TO ESTIMATE EMISSIONS RIGHT WE

00:45:37.301 --> 00:45:40.604
WE WE TRY OUR BEST AND WE

00:45:40.671 --> 00:45:43.507
NOTHING IS PERFECT -- BUT TO SAY

00:45:43.574 --> 00:45:45.809
THAT.

00:45:45.876 --> 00:45:47.244
THAT IT'S AN IMPERFECT SCIENCE

00:45:47.311 --> 00:45:48.812
AND THAT THAT SHOULD MEAN THAT

00:45:48.879 --> 00:45:49.580
WE DON'T DO ANYTHING IN THIS

00:45:49.646 --> 00:45:51.582
AREA I THINK WOULD BE A BIG

00:45:51.648 --> 00:45:54.151
MISTAKE GIVEN THE SIZE AND

00:45:54.218 --> 00:45:56.253
CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH --

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:58.188
WITH CARBON IMPACTING CLIMATE

00:45:58.255 --> 00:45:59.923
CHANGE.

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:02.126
AND SO AS I SAY.

00:46:02.192 --> 00:46:03.026
WE GOT SOME SMART PEOPLE OVER

00:46:03.093 --> 00:46:05.028
THE AIR BOARD -- WE WOULD WE

00:46:05.095 --> 00:46:07.297
WOULD TASK THEM WITH TRYING TO

00:46:07.364 --> 00:46:07.831
COME UP WITH SOME SORT OF

00:46:07.898 --> 00:46:09.399
FEASIBLE.

00:46:09.466 --> 00:46:10.634
MECHANISM IF BEING HOME BACK TO

00:46:10.701 --> 00:46:11.735
US AND SAY YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT

00:46:11.802 --> 00:46:13.604
ABLE TO DO THIS SO WE WE WE JUST

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:15.439
IT'S TOO IMPRACTICAL IT'S TOO

00:46:15.506 --> 00:46:17.007
AND FEASIBLE.

00:46:17.074 --> 00:46:17.608
THAT WE DON'T PURSUE IT OKAY

00:46:17.674 --> 00:46:19.176
THANK YOU.

00:46:19.243 --> 00:46:20.377
DIGITAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS

00:46:20.444 --> 00:46:22.079
FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS

00:46:22.146 --> 00:46:22.379
[inaudible]

00:46:22.446 --> 00:46:25.048
MISS PETRIE-NORRIS.

00:46:25.115 --> 00:46:27.451
YOU MENTIONED AT THAT SOME OTHER

00:46:27.518 --> 00:46:28.519
COUNTRIES HAVE STARTED TO TAKE

00:46:28.585 --> 00:46:29.286
SOME DECENT STEPS IN THIS

00:46:29.353 --> 00:46:31.455
DIRECTION CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT

00:46:31.522 --> 00:46:34.525
READ MORE AND PERHAPS TALK ABOUT

00:46:34.591 --> 00:46:35.225
HOW THEY'VE MADE.

00:46:35.292 --> 00:46:35.959
ARE THERE SOME PRACTICAL

00:46:36.026 --> 00:46:37.628
EXAMPLES WHERE WE'VE GOTTEN

00:46:37.694 --> 00:46:39.062
TRACTION WITH THIS KIND OF

00:46:39.129 --> 00:46:40.430
APPROACH.

00:46:40.497 --> 00:46:41.832
YES OF THE NETHERLANDS IS IS FOR

00:46:41.899 --> 00:46:43.901
THE MOST ADVANCED IN THIS AREA

00:46:43.967 --> 00:46:46.603
AND THEY HAVE -- YOU KNOW

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:49.373
CREATED THIS.

00:46:49.439 --> 00:46:50.674
THE SYSTEM THAT WE CAN GET YOU

00:46:50.741 --> 00:46:51.341
SOME INFORMATION THE OECD'S BEEN

00:46:51.408 --> 00:46:53.777
BEEN REPORTING ON THIS BUT THEY

00:46:53.844 --> 00:46:55.279
BASICALLY GO THROUGH -- THROUGH

00:46:55.345 --> 00:46:57.381
SECTORS AND THE LOOK AT CARBON

00:46:57.447 --> 00:46:58.549
EMISSIONS AND THEN THEY THEY'LL

00:46:58.615 --> 00:46:59.917
THEY'LL GO THROUGH AND AND KIND

00:46:59.983 --> 00:47:01.251
OF DO A DEEP DIVE INTO EACH

00:47:01.318 --> 00:47:02.986
OTHER SECTORS AND AND LOOK AT

00:47:03.053 --> 00:47:03.620
PRODUCTS.

00:47:03.687 --> 00:47:05.222
WE NEED EACH OF THOSE SECTORS

00:47:05.289 --> 00:47:05.856
WHERE THEY CAN MOVE THE NEEDLE

00:47:05.923 --> 00:47:10.727
THE MOST -- AND AND SO I I'M NOT

00:47:10.794 --> 00:47:13.697
A EXPERT IN THEIR PRICING SYSTEM --

00:47:13.764 --> 00:47:15.732
I DON'T KNOW IF ONE OF THE TWO

00:47:15.799 --> 00:47:16.967
NEW CAPS AND CONDITIONAL

00:47:17.034 --> 00:47:17.467
THOUGHTS ON THE WAY THEY

00:47:17.534 --> 00:47:18.802
STRUCTURE WE CAN CERTAINLY GET

00:47:18.869 --> 00:47:20.938
YOU INFORMATION AS TO THE MOLLEN

00:47:21.004 --> 00:47:23.273
BASE STRUCTURED -- BUT THEY YOU

00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:25.008
KNOW THEY THEY BUT BUT WHAT THEY

00:47:25.075 --> 00:47:26.176
HAVE DONE IS IS I I KNOW THEIR

00:47:26.243 --> 00:47:27.678
FOCUS KIND OF GETTING BACK TO

00:47:27.744 --> 00:47:29.379
THE EARLIER QUESTION NEED TO

00:47:29.446 --> 00:47:32.849
REALLY FOCUS IN ON I AND 80% OF

00:47:32.916 --> 00:47:34.451
CAR OF CO TWO EMISSIONS.

00:47:34.518 --> 00:47:36.753
AS OPPOSED TO EVERY PRODUCT

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:38.155
RIGHT THERE THEY'RE NOT SPENDING

00:47:38.222 --> 00:47:39.489
ALL THEIR TIME.

00:47:39.556 --> 00:47:41.191
ON AND ON THE ON THE HIGH

00:47:41.258 --> 00:47:42.726
HANGING FRUIT IT'S ALL ABOUT THE

00:47:42.793 --> 00:47:43.594
IT'S IT'S ABOUT THE BITS ABOUT

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:45.529
WHERE MOST OF THE PROBLEM IS AND

00:47:45.596 --> 00:47:47.931
REALLY FOCUSING IN ON THOSE

00:47:47.998 --> 00:47:52.469
KINDS OF ITEMS AND PRODUCTS.

00:47:52.536 --> 00:47:53.437
BECAUSE IT WRAPS THE RIGHT WE

00:47:53.503 --> 00:47:54.705
CAN'T WHICH WE'RE NOT GOING TO

00:47:54.771 --> 00:47:57.941
SIT HERE AND YOU KNOW I I AND

00:47:58.008 --> 00:47:59.209
AND AND FIGURE OUT A MECHANISM

00:47:59.276 --> 00:48:01.912
FOR FOR PRICING.

00:48:01.979 --> 00:48:03.914
EVERY MINISCULE ITEM.

00:48:03.981 --> 00:48:04.581
AND IN THE IN A THAT WOULD BE A

00:48:04.648 --> 00:48:05.882
WASTE OF OUR TIME AND OUR

00:48:05.949 --> 00:48:07.784
RESOURCES THERE ARE CERTAIN

00:48:07.851 --> 00:48:09.987
PRODUCTS THAT THAT ARE THAT ARE

00:48:10.053 --> 00:48:11.121
REALLY.

00:48:11.188 --> 00:48:12.990
CAUSING THE MOST DAMAGE IN TERMS

00:48:13.056 --> 00:48:14.725
OF CLIMATE CHANGE AYE AYE THE

00:48:14.791 --> 00:48:15.325
SUN MEMBER BETWEEN OURS I CAN

00:48:15.392 --> 00:48:16.093
SHARE WITH YOU.

00:48:16.159 --> 00:48:18.028
THIS CHART HERE -- SURE THOSE

00:48:18.095 --> 00:48:19.129
ABOUT THE SYSTEM THAT THEY WERE

00:48:19.196 --> 00:48:21.031
NOT WAITING FOR ANYONE ELSE AT

00:48:21.098 --> 00:48:24.268
THIS TIME OKAY.

00:48:24.334 --> 00:48:27.337
HERE TAKE A LOOK.

00:48:27.404 --> 00:48:39.516
IF THE CHAIR IS OKAY.

00:48:39.583 --> 00:48:40.417
ANY OTHER ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS

00:48:40.484 --> 00:48:43.387
OR COMMENTS.

00:48:43.453 --> 00:48:44.621
YEAH THIS IS IT.

00:48:44.688 --> 00:48:45.889
WELL ON THE FIRST PAGE ANYWAY

00:48:45.956 --> 00:48:47.491
IT'S INFORMATION WE ALREADY HAVE

00:48:47.557 --> 00:48:49.359
LIKE WHICH INDUSTRIES ARE MOST

00:48:49.426 --> 00:48:50.527
CARBON INTENSIVE.

00:48:50.594 --> 00:48:51.928
AND AS FAR AS MANUFACTURING GOES

00:48:51.995 --> 00:48:53.930
WE ALSO KNOW WHICH ONES ARE MOST

00:48:53.997 --> 00:48:55.132
COMMON IN.

00:48:55.198 --> 00:48:56.833
MOST CARBON INTENSIVE

00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:58.302
PARTICULARLY -- MAKING CONCRETE

00:48:58.368 --> 00:49:00.570
AND CEMENT RIGHT EYES ONE OF THE

00:49:00.637 --> 00:49:03.674
BIGGEST IN THE INDUSTRY -- AND

00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:05.142
THEREFORE TWENTY OF OUR BIG

00:49:05.208 --> 00:49:07.978
TARGETS.

00:49:08.045 --> 00:49:10.781
ANYWAY ALL RIGHT WELL THAT'S

00:49:10.847 --> 00:49:12.149
YEAH THEIR ATTENTION YEAH THAT'S

00:49:12.215 --> 00:49:13.417
MEANT AND THE THING IS WE'RE

00:49:13.483 --> 00:49:14.184
ALREADY DOING THAT SO.

00:49:14.251 --> 00:49:14.951
I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

00:49:15.018 --> 00:49:16.687
EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR

00:49:16.753 --> 00:49:19.389
BECAUSE WE ALREADY LOOK AT YOU

00:49:19.456 --> 00:49:20.891
KNOW IN THE INDUSTRIES

00:49:20.957 --> 00:49:22.592
PARTICULARLY SAMANTHA.

00:49:22.659 --> 00:49:25.562
OF WHAT ARE THE BIGGEST --

00:49:25.629 --> 00:49:27.964
IMPACTORS AND WE KNOW THAT WE'RE

00:49:28.031 --> 00:49:30.334
WORKING ON THAT AND THEY HAVE TO

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:32.536
PAY ALREADY A CARBON TAX FOR

00:49:32.602 --> 00:49:34.338
THAT. FOR THE CO TWO THEY

00:49:34.404 --> 00:49:35.238
GENERATE.

00:49:35.305 --> 00:49:36.473
AND IN GENERAL FOR THE

00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:39.042
INDUSTRIES HERE IN THE US IF

00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:41.044
THEY'RE GENERATING CO -- TWO AT

00:49:41.111 --> 00:49:42.813
LEAST IN CALIFORNIA WERE KEEPING

00:49:42.879 --> 00:49:46.717
TRACK OF THAT -- AND THEN IT

00:49:46.783 --> 00:49:48.218
BECOMES VERY COMPLEX AS WE DO

00:49:48.285 --> 00:49:52.456
CAP AND TRADE BUT THIS IS.

00:49:52.522 --> 00:49:53.790
THIS JUST GOES WAY BEYOND THAT

00:49:53.857 --> 00:49:55.792
MAYBE OR MAYBE NOT I'M JUST NOT

00:49:55.859 --> 00:49:59.229
SURE EXACTLY THE LEVEL OF DETAIL.

00:49:59.296 --> 00:50:01.264
AND WOULD YOU SAY YOUR BILL

00:50:01.331 --> 00:50:02.632
WOULD ALLOW THEM TO DETERMINE

00:50:02.699 --> 00:50:06.570
THE LEVEL OF DETAIL THEY GO INTO.

00:50:06.636 --> 00:50:09.806
OUR EXTENT YES -- BETTY BUT I

00:50:09.873 --> 00:50:10.640
THINK WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:50:10.707 --> 00:50:12.576
REPLACING THE SALES TAX WHICH IS

00:50:12.642 --> 00:50:14.311
ON EVERY ITEM.

00:50:14.378 --> 00:50:15.712
REST IF I READ YOUR BILL CORRECT

00:50:15.779 --> 00:50:18.148
ALL IDEA WOULD BE IF IF IF IT

00:50:18.215 --> 00:50:19.783
TURNS OUT THAT THERE IS THERE IS

00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:21.318
THERE IS A THERE THERE WITH

00:50:21.385 --> 00:50:22.452
REGARDS TO THIS STUDY.

00:50:22.519 --> 00:50:24.554
THE IDEA IS THAT WE COULD LOOK

00:50:24.621 --> 00:50:27.057
INTO THE POSSIBILITY OF GETTING

00:50:27.124 --> 00:50:28.625
RID OF SOUTHEAST TAX ALTOGETHER.

00:50:28.692 --> 00:50:29.993
AND REPLACING IT WITH A REVENUE

00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:32.162
NEUTRAL.

00:50:32.229 --> 00:50:33.230
TAX ASSOCIATE WITH CARBON

00:50:33.296 --> 00:50:35.465
INTENSITY.

00:50:35.532 --> 00:50:36.466
I JUST.

00:50:36.533 --> 00:50:39.202
THAT THEY'RE A LOT AT OF OF OPEN

00:50:39.269 --> 00:50:41.838
QUESTIONS RIGHT I MEAN IF IF IF.

00:50:41.905 --> 00:50:43.440
IF YOU ARE WORST FEARS PROOF

00:50:43.507 --> 00:50:44.508
FOUNDED.

00:50:44.574 --> 00:50:46.176
AND THIS ENDS UP BEING TOTALLY

00:50:46.243 --> 00:50:49.146
IMPRACTICAL UNTIL YOU FEASIBLE.

00:50:49.212 --> 00:50:50.414
YEAH THE ANSWER BACK AS HEY YOU

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:52.249
KNOW LOVE THE IDEA LOVE THE KIND

00:50:52.315 --> 00:50:53.517
OF GENERAL CONCEPT BUT THE OTHER

00:50:53.583 --> 00:50:55.018
DAY THIS IS NOT GOING TO ONE ON

00:50:55.085 --> 00:50:55.619
THE GROUND IN TERMS

00:50:55.685 --> 00:50:58.522
IMPLEMENTATION OKAY I KNOW THIS

00:50:58.588 --> 00:50:59.322
BUT I WILL SAY THE HOUSE THE

00:50:59.389 --> 00:50:59.890
SEXES IS IS.

00:50:59.956 --> 00:51:02.626
SO MUCH BIGGER THAN CAP AND

00:51:02.692 --> 00:51:04.060
TRADE I MEAN IT CAPITA RAISES

00:51:04.127 --> 00:51:04.361
[inaudible]

00:51:04.428 --> 00:51:05.929
VERY SMALL -- BUT BUT THE OTHER

00:51:05.996 --> 00:51:07.431
IDEA HERE IS THAT WE WOULD NOT

00:51:07.497 --> 00:51:08.832
RAISE TAXES ON TO SAY THIS WOULD

00:51:08.899 --> 00:51:09.900
THIS WOULD BE REVENUE NEUTRAL

00:51:09.966 --> 00:51:11.168
WOULD BE GETTING RID.

00:51:11.234 --> 00:51:12.803
OF AN ENTIRE [inaudible]

00:51:12.869 --> 00:51:14.571
TAX ALTOGETHER.

00:51:14.638 --> 00:51:17.841
IF YOU DO IT BY INDUSTRY GROUPS.

00:51:17.908 --> 00:51:19.576
THEN HOW TO PEOPLE YOU KNOW YOU

00:51:19.643 --> 00:51:20.644
GOT TO BUY A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF

00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:22.446
CEMENT NO MATTER WHAT.

00:51:22.512 --> 00:51:26.049
THERE'S ALREADY -- CALCULATIONS

00:51:26.116 --> 00:51:27.617
FOR LOCAL CEMENT COMPANIES.

00:51:27.684 --> 00:51:29.052
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WORKS OUT

00:51:29.119 --> 00:51:30.654
WITH CAP AND TRADE BUT IF WE DO

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:32.456
BY INDUSTRY GROUPS THEN THERE'S

00:51:32.522 --> 00:51:34.257
NO REAL SUBSTITUTION OF

00:51:34.324 --> 00:51:37.160
AVAILABLE SO I'M NOT SURE.

00:51:37.227 --> 00:51:38.328
THAT THIS WOULD DO ANY GOOD.

00:51:38.395 --> 00:51:39.796
ANYWAY I JUST HAVE LOTS OF

00:51:39.863 --> 00:51:40.997
QUESTIONS.

00:51:41.064 --> 00:51:41.998
IF THAT POINT YOU HAVE TO THEN

00:51:42.065 --> 00:51:44.868
GO INTO -- INTO KIND F SPECIFIC

00:51:44.935 --> 00:51:45.902
ITEMS WITHIN THE INDUSTRY BUT

00:51:45.969 --> 00:51:47.304
THE BUT THE POINT BEING YOU'RE

00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:48.905
GONNA FOCUS ON THOSE INDUSTRIES

00:51:48.972 --> 00:51:51.374
THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST INTENSITY.

00:51:51.441 --> 00:51:53.009
NUMBER YOU CAN REALLY FOCUS YOUR

00:51:53.076 --> 00:51:54.244
ATTENTION FIRST.

00:51:54.311 --> 00:51:55.412
OF THEIR SOME THIS THIS A

00:51:55.479 --> 00:51:56.746
MINISTRY THAT GET COUNTERFEITING

00:51:56.813 --> 00:51:58.148
YOU 20%.

00:51:58.215 --> 00:51:59.850
OF EMISSIONS I'VE YOU'RE GONNA

00:51:59.916 --> 00:52:01.685
YOU'RE GONNA REALLY DIG IN ON

00:52:01.751 --> 00:52:03.487
THOSE KINDS OF THAT SORT OF

00:52:03.553 --> 00:52:05.922
INDUSTRY THAN BEEN WAY OUT SO WE

00:52:05.989 --> 00:52:07.824
FIVE SAMANTHA WIND.

00:52:07.891 --> 00:52:08.859
ALSO FUELS IS ANOTHER WERE

00:52:08.925 --> 00:52:10.727
ALREADY DOING WORK ON THOSE BIG

00:52:10.794 --> 00:52:16.466
ISSUES I'M NOT SURE.

00:52:16.533 --> 00:52:19.469
THAT TAKING A LOOK AT SHOOTERS

00:52:19.536 --> 00:52:20.504
FOR EXAMPLE NOW WE WE CAN RATE

00:52:20.570 --> 00:52:21.771
THEM IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT OF

00:52:21.838 --> 00:52:22.405
ELECTRICITY THEY DO AND I THINK

00:52:22.472 --> 00:52:23.840
THEY'RE ALREADY DOING THAT.

00:52:23.907 --> 00:52:24.975
FOR A LOT OF ITEMS THAT DO USE

00:52:25.041 --> 00:52:27.777
ELECTRICITY I JUST DON'T SEE

00:52:27.844 --> 00:52:29.179
EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE GONNA.

00:52:29.246 --> 00:52:32.649
REALLY BE ABLE TO INCENTIVIZE OR

00:52:32.716 --> 00:52:35.485
FOR THIS -- BECAUSE IF YOU'RE

00:52:35.552 --> 00:52:36.620
LOOKING AT THE WHOLE LIFE CYCLES

00:52:36.686 --> 00:52:39.189
CAN BE VERY HARD TO DETERMINE.

00:52:39.256 --> 00:52:41.291
YOU KNOW IN CHINA HOW MUCH

00:52:41.358 --> 00:52:43.293
CARBON USE THERE IS TO MAKE THIS

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:46.096
LAPTOP VERSUS BAT LAPTOP.

00:52:46.162 --> 00:52:48.732
RIGHT TO THE EXTENT THAT -- THAT

00:52:48.798 --> 00:52:49.366
THERE ARE BOARDS ARE DONE A LOT

00:52:49.432 --> 00:52:50.433
OF WORK IN THIS AREA ACTUALLY

00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:52.569
WILL BE LESS COSTLY THAN HAD

00:52:52.636 --> 00:52:54.004
BEEN INITIALLY ANTICIPATED.

00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:57.707
I'M IN FACT I KNOW THAT THE

00:52:57.774 --> 00:53:00.143
LATEST AND YEAH ESTIMATES FOR

00:53:00.210 --> 00:53:00.810
THE BECAUSE THIS BILL OF DROPPED

00:53:00.877 --> 00:53:01.378
SIGNIFICANTLY I THINK IT'S

00:53:01.444 --> 00:53:02.879
PARTLY HAVING TO DO WITH WHAT

00:53:02.946 --> 00:53:04.648
YOU'VE JUST TALKED ABOUT THIS IN

00:53:04.714 --> 00:53:05.081
WORDS ARE YOU HAPPY.

00:53:05.148 --> 00:53:07.984
AREA -- MEDIATOR THE DAY THIS IS

00:53:08.051 --> 00:53:09.486
ABOUT TRYING.

00:53:09.553 --> 00:53:10.787
TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EVERYTHING

00:53:10.854 --> 00:53:12.322
YOU'VE JUST DESCRIBED MMHM AND

00:53:12.389 --> 00:53:15.792
SEE IF THERE IS A WAY. TO TO

00:53:15.859 --> 00:53:17.227
ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IN A FEASIBLE

00:53:17.294 --> 00:53:19.296
PRACTICAL WAY.

00:53:19.362 --> 00:53:21.231
CURRENT THANK YOU ANSWER IS NO

00:53:21.298 --> 00:53:22.365
YEAH WE WE DON'T MOVE ANY WE

00:53:22.432 --> 00:53:23.133
DON'T FEEL FOR WITH IT.

00:53:23.199 --> 00:53:25.068
OKAY THANK YOU.

00:53:25.135 --> 00:53:27.470
I KNOW THAT DID YOU WANT.

00:53:27.537 --> 00:53:28.672
TO WELL I WAS JUST GONNA SAY.

00:53:28.738 --> 00:53:31.141
AS FAR AS INDUSTRIES TO LOOK AT

00:53:31.207 --> 00:53:32.742
BEYOND CEMENT AND COMPUTERS

00:53:32.809 --> 00:53:34.277
THERE ARE OTHERS OUT THERE SUCH

00:53:34.344 --> 00:53:37.747
AS FABRICS SHOES HOUSEWARES.

00:53:37.814 --> 00:53:38.982
THE LIKE IN THE PEOPLE WERE

00:53:39.049 --> 00:53:40.216
LOOKING AT THE LOOK OF LIFE

00:53:40.283 --> 00:53:42.052
CYCLE ANALYSIS OF THAT THEY

00:53:42.118 --> 00:53:44.020
MIGHT BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY.

00:53:44.087 --> 00:53:45.522
POINT SIX CENTER THAT YOU WOULD.

00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:47.057
DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM IS MOST OF

00:53:47.123 --> 00:53:48.758
THOSE ARE GENERATED ARE MADE

00:53:48.825 --> 00:53:50.026
OVERSEAS THE ONES PARTICULAR

00:53:50.093 --> 00:53:51.061
FABRIC.

00:53:51.127 --> 00:53:55.031
AND IT'S GONNA BE VERY HARD TO

00:53:55.098 --> 00:53:57.634
REALLY GET A RELIABLE NUMBER.

00:53:57.701 --> 00:53:58.935
THAT COULD BE TRUE AYE AYE I YES

00:53:59.002 --> 00:53:59.502
MA'AM IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING

00:53:59.569 --> 00:53:59.703
THAT.

00:53:59.769 --> 00:54:00.637
THE LAW A LOW CARBON FUEL

00:54:00.704 --> 00:54:01.738
STANDARD WHICH THEY HAD

00:54:01.805 --> 00:54:02.806
DETERMINED SOME OF THE CARBON

00:54:02.872 --> 00:54:04.641
INTENSITY ON SOME OF THAT

00:54:04.708 --> 00:54:06.076
ACTUALLY IS COMING FROM

00:54:06.142 --> 00:54:07.544
DEFINITELY COMING FROM OUT OF

00:54:07.611 --> 00:54:09.279
STATE -- SURE SEES BUT THEN

00:54:09.346 --> 00:54:10.313
THAT'S HAVE LAWSUIT TO TED

00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:12.315
STUDIES FOR YEARS IT IS VERY

00:54:12.382 --> 00:54:13.917
DIFFICULT TO DO THIS.

00:54:13.984 --> 00:54:17.854
IT IS A MAJOR RESEARCH PROJECT

00:54:17.921 --> 00:54:18.154
[inaudible]

00:54:18.221 --> 00:54:20.557
AND FOR I'M JUST SKEPTICAL A WE

00:54:20.624 --> 00:54:24.327
CAN DO IT BE THAT TACK.

00:54:24.394 --> 00:54:25.095
THAT ONE INTO THE DEAD DID YOU

00:54:25.161 --> 00:54:26.162
ACTUALLY ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT

00:54:26.229 --> 00:54:28.098
THE ISSUE USES LESS CARBON THE

00:54:28.164 --> 00:54:29.132
NATURAL.

00:54:29.199 --> 00:54:30.200
YOU CAN DETERMINE MAYBE THEY

00:54:30.266 --> 00:54:33.036
CHOOSE USE LESS CARBON THEN ARE

00:54:33.103 --> 00:54:38.141
MORE CARBON THAN -- PHILIP FLOPS

00:54:38.208 --> 00:54:40.210
YOU COULD PROBABLY DO THAT BUT

00:54:40.276 --> 00:54:41.244
ANYWAY IJUST I THINK I'VE I

00:54:41.311 --> 00:54:42.379
THINK WE DISCUSSED IT AS MUCH AS

00:54:42.445 --> 00:54:43.947
WE CAN.

00:54:44.014 --> 00:54:46.216
TOTALLY GET YOUR POINT -- I THIS

00:54:46.282 --> 00:54:48.051
A BILL BE LOOKING INTO ALL THESE

00:54:48.118 --> 00:54:51.287
KINDS OF ISSUES -- BUT BUT YOU

00:54:51.354 --> 00:54:51.955
KNOW.

00:54:52.022 --> 00:54:54.057
IF YOU EITHER I GUESS ONE OF THE

00:54:54.124 --> 00:54:55.425
ONE OF THE POINTS IS IS THAT.

00:54:55.492 --> 00:54:57.861
IF WE IF WE DO HAVE A STATICALLY

00:54:57.927 --> 00:55:00.296
ONE OWN COURAGE MORE OF ONE ITEM

00:55:00.363 --> 00:55:02.265
THAT IS LOCAL LAST CAR WRITTEN

00:55:02.332 --> 00:55:02.999
OTHER.

00:55:03.066 --> 00:55:04.134
RIGHT NOW THE SALES AND USE TAX

00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:05.635
IS JUST.

00:55:05.702 --> 00:55:06.569
THE SAME AMOUNT FOR EVERYTHING

00:55:06.636 --> 00:55:08.104
REGARDLESS.

00:55:08.171 --> 00:55:09.973
HI AND MAYBE THERE OUGHT TO BE A

00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:14.210
LITTLE BIT MORE OF A NEXUS.

00:55:14.277 --> 00:55:20.984
OKAY WELL I SHOULD LET YOU GO.

00:55:21.051 --> 00:55:22.852
THIS IS THE STUDY IT'S JUST A

00:55:22.919 --> 00:55:23.453
STUDY.

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:27.190
AND I I THINK IT'S A WORTHWHILE.

00:55:27.257 --> 00:55:29.392
IT'S A WORTHWHILE STUDY.

00:55:29.459 --> 00:55:30.560
ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS

00:55:30.627 --> 00:55:34.597
FROM THE COMMITTEE.

00:55:34.664 --> 00:55:36.666
SEEN AND I HAVE JUST A QUICK.

00:55:36.733 --> 00:55:37.567
THEY JUST GOT HERE I THOUGHT I'D

00:55:37.634 --> 00:55:39.636
SAY SOMETHING -- I I I KNOW IT'S

00:55:39.703 --> 00:55:41.271
JUST A STUDY I JUST MY ONLY

00:55:41.337 --> 00:55:45.275
CONCERN IS THAT -- SALES TAX AND

00:55:45.341 --> 00:55:47.744
USE TAX IS GENERALLY REGRESSIVE.

00:55:47.811 --> 00:55:48.978
AND ALTHOUGH THIS IS JUST A

00:55:49.045 --> 00:55:51.047
STUDY I AM SUPER CONCERNED ABOUT

00:55:51.114 --> 00:55:53.516
WHAT THE FUTURE LEGISLATION THAT

00:55:53.583 --> 00:55:55.819
WOULD BE DERIVED FROM THIS KIND

00:55:55.885 --> 00:55:56.653
OF BILL AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE

00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:57.687
SURE THAT.

00:55:57.754 --> 00:55:59.122
I AM ON RECORD AND AND THAT WE

00:55:59.189 --> 00:56:01.958
YOU AND I FOLLOW UP AND HAVE A

00:56:02.025 --> 00:56:03.159
CONVERSATION ABOUT WHATEVER.

00:56:03.226 --> 00:56:04.761
LEGISLATION YOU DO PERCEIVE TO

00:56:04.828 --> 00:56:06.830
COME FROM THIS -- IS VERY VERY

00:56:06.896 --> 00:56:08.932
AWARE THAT IT'S COMMUNITIES LIKE

00:56:08.998 --> 00:56:09.566
MINE THAT SO OFTEN END UP TAKING

00:56:09.632 --> 00:56:11.134
THE BURDEN FOR ISSUES LIKE THIS

00:56:11.201 --> 00:56:13.737
AND AND AND THAT WOULD BE OF

00:56:13.803 --> 00:56:15.705
GREAT CONCERN FOR ME SO I

00:56:15.772 --> 00:56:16.573
UNDERSTAND TO STUDY IN THEIR

00:56:16.639 --> 00:56:17.707
GREAT THINGS THAT CAN CAN COME

00:56:17.774 --> 00:56:18.775
FROM THE STUDY.

00:56:18.842 --> 00:56:19.642
BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:56:19.709 --> 00:56:21.778
YOU'RE VERY AWARE OF THE

00:56:21.845 --> 00:56:23.279
CONCERNS OF MINE AND OF THE

00:56:23.346 --> 00:56:24.280
COMMITTEE UNTIL YOU GET IT AND

00:56:24.347 --> 00:56:26.583
IN PART -- WE DISCUSSED IS THAT

00:56:26.649 --> 00:56:27.550
IS THAT.

00:56:27.617 --> 00:56:28.718
IF IT WERE TO BE FOUND AND

00:56:28.785 --> 00:56:30.120
THERE'S SOME VERY THERE WITH

00:56:30.186 --> 00:56:32.622
REGARD TO THIS WORK. ONE OF THE

00:56:32.689 --> 00:56:34.023
IDEAS WOULD BE IN FACT MIKE.

00:56:34.090 --> 00:56:35.125
KIND OF FOUGHT COMING INTO THIS

00:56:35.191 --> 00:56:36.559
WITH THAT WE WOULD GET RID OF

00:56:36.626 --> 00:56:38.695
THE PROGRESSIVE CELLS USE TAX

00:56:38.762 --> 00:56:39.162
ALTOGETHER.

00:56:39.229 --> 00:56:39.763
AND THAT IT WOULD BE REPLACED

00:56:39.829 --> 00:56:43.967
WITH THE REVENUE NEUTRAL -- YEAH

00:56:44.033 --> 00:56:45.802
CARBON INTENSITY PRICE RIGHT

00:56:45.869 --> 00:56:47.637
THAT THAT COULD BE REGRESSIVE TO

00:56:47.704 --> 00:56:49.038
THAT CAME OUT VERY WERE GOING TO

00:56:49.105 --> 00:56:49.539
POINT IS THEY'RE BOTH.

00:56:49.606 --> 00:56:51.274
LIKE I WE WOULD WE WOULD NOT BE

00:56:51.341 --> 00:56:53.676
RAISING TAXES ON SOCIETY.

00:56:53.743 --> 00:56:54.644
AND THAT BUT YOU'RE UPS RIGHT

00:56:54.711 --> 00:56:55.979
YEAH HOW WOULD WE MAKE SURE TO

00:56:56.045 --> 00:56:57.747
ENSURE EXACTLY BECAUSE THAT YES

00:56:57.814 --> 00:56:59.182
QUITE OFTEN IT IS.

00:56:59.249 --> 00:57:00.350
ALTHOUGH IT WOULD BE REVENUE

00:57:00.416 --> 00:57:01.584
NEUTRAL IT IS COMMUNITIES LIKE

00:57:01.651 --> 00:57:03.119
MY LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THAT

00:57:03.186 --> 00:57:04.187
WOULD TAKE THE BURDEN ON

00:57:04.254 --> 00:57:06.156

SIX MONTHS AFTERWARDS SO WE WILL

ANALYZING THE TAX EXPENDITURES

01:23:13.922 --> 01:23:15.090

01:23:22.664 --> 01:23:23.798
REPORTING REQUIREMENT.

01:23:23.865 --> 01:23:25.734
AND THE GOAL HERE IS TO GET AN

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:28.002
OBJECTIVE VIEW OF WHETHER OR NOT

01:23:28.069 --> 01:23:29.738
THESE TAX EXPENDITURES THAT WE

01:23:29.804 --> 01:23:31.306
PUT INTO PLACE.

01:23:31.373 --> 01:23:33.775
ANYWHERE UP TO FIFTY SIXTY YEARS

01:23:33.842 --> 01:23:35.944
AGO ARE STILL RELEVANT -- NOW

01:23:36.010 --> 01:23:40.915
STARTING IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND

01:23:40.982 --> 01:23:42.217
BEYOND WE ACTUALLY ARE DOING

01:23:42.283 --> 01:23:43.184
THAT WITH ALL OF THE NEW OR TAX

01:23:43.251 --> 01:23:44.219
EXPENDITURES BUT THE OLD ONES

01:23:44.285 --> 01:23:44.786
THEY'RE STILL THERE THEY'VE

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:46.054
NEVER BEEN EVALUATED THEY'VE

01:23:46.121 --> 01:23:47.555
NEVER BEEN ANALYZED AS TO

01:23:47.622 --> 01:23:48.423
WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE.

01:23:48.490 --> 01:23:49.824
FUNCTIONING AS THEY WERE

01:23:49.891 --> 01:23:51.726
INTENDED AND WHETHER OR NOT

01:23:51.793 --> 01:23:53.128
THERE BUT STILL BENEFITING THE

01:23:53.194 --> 01:23:55.063
PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND

01:23:55.130 --> 01:23:56.498
PARTICULARLY THE TAXPAYER.

01:23:56.564 --> 01:23:58.767
SO WE NOW HAVE ABOUT EIGHTY OF

01:23:58.833 --> 01:24:00.435
THESE TAX EXPENDITURES THERE

01:24:00.502 --> 01:24:02.370
PROVISIONS IN THE TAX CODE EYES

01:24:02.437 --> 01:24:03.104

DEDUCTIONS SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS

01:24:05.707 --> 01:24:07.342
INCOME EXCLUSIONS.

01:24:07.409 --> 01:24:08.843
THAT REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TAX

01:24:08.910 --> 01:24:10.812
COLLECTED IN EXCHANGE FOR WHAT

01:24:10.879 --> 01:24:12.814
IS AN INTENDED PUBLIC POLICY

01:24:12.881 --> 01:24:14.215
OBJECTIVE.

01:24:14.282 --> 01:24:15.984
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS COMMISSION

01:24:16.050 --> 01:24:18.720
THIS OUR RESEARCH ORGANIZATION

01:24:18.787 --> 01:24:20.555
IS GOING TO DO THEY'RE GOING TO

01:24:20.622 --> 01:24:23.224
LOOK WHAT WAS THE DESIGN PURPOSE

01:24:23.291 --> 01:24:25.126
HASN'T MET THAT PURPOSE IS IT

01:24:25.193 --> 01:24:26.861
STILL MEETING THEIR PURPOSE.

01:24:26.928 --> 01:24:27.462
AND THEN IT'S GOING TO BRING

01:24:27.529 --> 01:24:29.931

UC'S REPORT AND THE BOARD'S

01:24:41.543 --> 01:24:45.246
RECOMMENDATIONS AND THEN --

01:24:45.313 --> 01:24:48.216
EXCUSE ME -- I MISSED A STEP

01:24:48.283 --> 01:24:49.584
BECAUSE THIS IS DONE IN SORT OF

01:24:49.651 --> 01:24:51.553
TRANCHES SO THAT WE CAN KEEP

01:24:51.619 --> 01:24:53.054

AND A NON PARTISAN AS POSSIBLE

01:24:55.557 --> 01:24:58.159
SO AFTER THE UNIVERSITY

CALIFORNIA DOES ITS RESEARCH --

01:25:00.361 --> 01:25:01.930
IT WILL PRESENT ITS FINDINGS TO

01:25:01.996 --> 01:25:04.299

CONSIDER THIS INFORMATION AND

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:20.315
MAKE A RECOMMENDATION TO THE

01:25:20.381 --> 01:25:23.017
LEGISLATURE -- AS TO WHETHER THE

01:25:23.084 --> 01:25:25.053

01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:54.482
THE GOAL HERE IS TO GET THE

01:25:54.549 --> 01:25:56.451
INFORMATION WE NEED TO EVALUATE

01:25:56.518 --> 01:25:57.952
THESE PAST EXPENDITURES BECAUSE

01:25:58.019 --> 01:25:59.654
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT FOR

01:25:59.721 --> 01:26:02.323
EVERY DOLLAR THAT THE STATE

01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:04.759
THAT IT COULD GET. FORTY CENTS

01:26:04.826 --> 01:26:06.194
OF THAT DOLLAR WOULD GO TO

01:26:06.261 --> 01:26:08.563
EDUCATION AND THE OTHER 60%

01:26:08.630 --> 01:26:10.498
COULD GO TO OTHER PROGRAMS NOW

01:26:10.565 --> 01:26:12.267
IF THESE FUNDS IF THESE PROGRAMS

01:26:12.333 --> 01:26:14.502
ARE WORKING OBVIOUSLY THE

01:26:14.569 --> 01:26:15.837
LEGISLATURE SAY WE'RE GONNA KEEP.

01:26:15.904 --> 01:26:18.006
BUT BECAUSE WE HAVE NO MECHANISM

01:26:18.072 --> 01:26:20.642
IN PLACE NOW TO ADDRESS THESE

01:26:20.708 --> 01:26:22.877
PAST TAX EXPENDITURES WE HAVEN'T

01:26:22.944 --> 01:26:24.045
GOT A CLUE.

01:26:24.112 --> 01:26:25.280
THIS IS SOMETHING I ACTUALLY

01:26:25.346 --> 01:26:26.614
THAT CAME TO MY ATTENTION WHEN I

01:26:26.681 --> 01:26:28.116
FIRST GOT ELECTED A HUNDRED

01:26:28.182 --> 01:26:29.717
YEARS AGO INTO THE ASSEMBLY AND

01:26:29.784 --> 01:26:31.920
WONDERED WHY WE HADN'T DONE THIS.

01:26:31.986 --> 01:26:33.521
AND SO I'M REALLY EXCITED THAT

01:26:33.588 --> 01:26:35.056
HERE WE ARE WE'VE BEEN WORKING

01:26:35.123 --> 01:26:36.157
CLOSELY.

01:26:36.224 --> 01:26:38.459
WITH YOUR MEMBERS WITH THE CHAIR

01:26:38.526 --> 01:26:39.861
AND I THINK WE'VE GOT THAT SWEET

01:26:39.928 --> 01:26:42.030
SPOT HERE THE GOAL IS NOT TO

01:26:42.096 --> 01:26:43.831
HAVE ANY BIAS GOING IN IT JUST

01:26:43.898 --> 01:26:46.267
ASK THE QUESTION IS IS WORKING.

01:26:46.334 --> 01:26:47.969
DO WE WANT TO CONTINUE WITH IT

01:26:48.036 --> 01:26:49.037
AND THEN MAKE THE DECISIONS

01:26:49.103 --> 01:26:50.939
GOING FORWARD SO I HAVE WITH ME

01:26:51.005 --> 01:26:53.007

PROVIDES A DEEPER LEVEL OF

01:27:20.101 --> 01:27:21.436
TRANSPARENCY INTO THE

01:27:45.426 --> 01:27:46.260
DOLLARS.

01:27:46.327 --> 01:27:47.695
IRONICALLY THIS IS AT THE SAME

01:27:47.762 --> 01:27:49.664
TIME THAT CALIFORNIA WAS IN THE

01:27:49.731 --> 01:27:50.999
MIDST OF THE GREAT RECESSION SO

01:27:51.065 --> 01:27:52.200
SOME MAY ASK.

SIR IF I MAY RESPOND THAT'S WHY

01:40:00.828 --> 01:40:01.328
THIS IS THREE THE CARD THREE

01:40:01.395 --> 01:40:02.396
LEVELS THE FIRST LEVEL IS

01:40:02.463 --> 01:40:03.030
UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA WE RELY

01:40:03.097 --> 01:40:03.597
UPON THEM FOR A LOT OF THE

01:40:03.664 --> 01:40:04.198
RESEARCH THAT WE HAVE IN THE

SPECIFIC MANDATE TO LOOK AT

01:40:09.203 --> 01:40:11.572
THESE AND TO CONSIDER A VARIETY

01:40:11.638 --> 01:40:14.174
OF DIFFERENT FACTORS -- AND THAT

01:40:14.241 --> 01:40:16.076
IS THEIR JOB IS TO COME UP WITH

01:40:16.143 --> 01:40:17.177
THE DATA.

01:40:17.244 --> 01:40:20.781
THE SECOND IS TO TAKE THAT DATA

01:40:20.848 --> 01:40:22.249
AND TO BRING.

01:40:22.316 --> 01:40:26.320

01:41:05.759 --> 01:41:07.594
GROUPS AND THEN IT WILL BE UP TO

01:41:07.661 --> 01:41:10.130
THE LEGISLATURE TO DECIDE WHAT

01:41:10.197 --> 01:41:12.433
TO DO -- WITH ALL THE

01:41:12.499 --> 01:41:13.600
INFORMATION AND THE

01:41:13.667 --> 01:41:15.068
DETERMINATIONS AND THE

01:41:15.135 --> 01:41:17.838
RECOMMENDATIONS AND EITHER APPLY

01:41:17.905 --> 01:41:20.240
THE RECOMMENDATIONS OR NOT.

01:41:20.307 --> 01:41:22.309
AND I SHARE WITH YOU I REPRESENT

01:41:22.376 --> 01:41:24.511
THE CENTRAL COAST WE'RE NOT VERY

01:41:24.578 --> 01:41:26.480
WELL LISTEN TO EITHER VERY MUCH

01:41:26.547 --> 01:41:28.081
THE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:41:28.148 --> 01:41:30.851
SENATE SEEMS TO SOMETIMES SKIP

01:41:30.918 --> 01:41:31.585
OVER US.

01:41:31.652 --> 01:41:32.953
TOO SO I AND I APPRECIATE THE

01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:35.222
THE FRUSTRATION BUT WHAT WE'RE

01:41:35.289 --> 01:41:37.024
GONNA DO IS ESSENTIALLY PULL

01:41:37.090 --> 01:41:38.892
BACK THE CURTAINS AND CREATE

01:41:38.959 --> 01:41:41.361
SUNSHINE FOR PROGRAMS THAT WE

01:41:41.428 --> 01:41:42.830
HAVE NEVER EVALUATED.

01:41:42.896 --> 01:41:44.097
SO IF YOU LOOK AT IT THAT WAY I

01:41:44.164 --> 01:41:45.933
THINK IT ADDRESSES THE CONCERNS

01:41:45.999 --> 01:41:46.733
YOU HAVE AND I SHARE YOUR

01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:48.435
FRUSTRATION BUT I I DON'T THINK

01:41:48.502 --> 01:41:52.573
THAT'S QUITE WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE

01:41:52.639 --> 01:41:56.643
IN THIS BILL -- DOCTOR PARK AND

01:41:56.710 --> 01:41:59.580
THEN MR MAYES.

01:41:59.646 --> 01:42:01.381
SO -- I'M HOPING I CAN BIG

01:42:01.448 --> 01:42:02.783
MISTER GRAY OVER TO A NIGHT BUT

01:42:02.850 --> 01:42:06.053
WE'LL SEE -- WITHOUT DATA WE ARE

01:42:06.119 --> 01:42:07.721
FLYING BLIND.

01:42:07.788 --> 01:42:10.524
NOW I LOVE THE R. D. TAX CREDIT.

01:42:10.591 --> 01:42:12.459
I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL BUT I

01:42:12.526 --> 01:42:13.794
DON'T KNOW.

01:42:13.861 --> 01:42:15.662
YOU KNOW IF WE LOSE INDUSTRIES

01:42:15.729 --> 01:42:19.066
IF WE DIDN'T HAVE IT -- YOU KNOW

01:42:19.132 --> 01:42:22.102
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN -- AND I I

01:42:22.169 --> 01:42:24.438
DON'T KNOW THAT I'LL LOOK

01:42:24.505 --> 01:42:25.739
TERRIBLY CLOSELY AT WHAT.

01:42:25.806 --> 01:42:27.341
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SAYS

01:42:27.407 --> 01:42:28.642
BUT I'M SURE AS HECK AND LOOK

01:42:28.709 --> 01:42:31.345
VERY CLOSELY AT NUMBERS.

01:42:31.411 --> 01:42:33.146
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU SEE WILL

01:42:33.213 --> 01:42:34.081
PRESENT.

01:42:34.147 --> 01:42:36.650
SO ARE WE ARE FLYING BLIND

01:42:36.717 --> 01:42:38.385
WITHOUT IT NOW I REALLY.

01:42:38.452 --> 01:42:39.720
I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE I

01:42:39.786 --> 01:42:41.655
WOULDN'T SUPPORT THE ARE ANTI

01:42:41.722 --> 01:42:44.024
TAX CREDIT BUT LET'S SEE WHAT

01:42:44.091 --> 01:42:45.926
THE DATA SAYS ARM.

01:42:45.993 --> 01:42:48.795
ANYWAY -- I'D LIKE TO THIS POINT

01:42:48.862 --> 01:42:53.166
MOVE THE BELL.

01:42:53.233 --> 01:42:54.701
ALL RIGHT AND THEN -- IF YOU

01:42:54.768 --> 01:42:56.470
COULD IF YOU DO AMEND THE BILL

01:42:56.537 --> 01:42:58.472
AGAIN I'D LOVE TO BE A CO AUTHOR

01:42:58.539 --> 01:43:05.412
THANK YOU THANK YOU.

01:43:05.479 --> 01:43:07.781
THIS A ACTUALLY BUT MISTER GRAY

01:43:07.848 --> 01:43:09.316
MOVE ME ON THIS ONE I WAS --

01:43:09.383 --> 01:43:11.385
ACTUALLY GOING TO SUPPORT THIS --

01:43:11.451 --> 01:43:12.753
TODAY AND I THINK I'M YEAH I

01:43:12.819 --> 01:43:13.954
THINK I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO LAY

01:43:14.021 --> 01:43:18.392
OFF AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY --

01:43:18.458 --> 01:43:20.661
YOUR INTENT IS RIGHT -- I THINK

01:43:20.727 --> 01:43:22.596
WE SHOULD KNOW -- YOU KNOW.

01:43:22.663 --> 01:43:23.630
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH AS A

01:43:23.697 --> 01:43:25.532
REPUBLICAN I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF

01:43:25.599 --> 01:43:27.534
TAX CREDITS -- BUT I VOTE FOR

01:43:27.601 --> 01:43:30.203
THEM OFTEN DUMB AND I'M NOT A

01:43:30.270 --> 01:43:32.239
BIG FAN OF TAX CREDITS BECAUSE I

01:43:32.306 --> 01:43:34.074
THINK OUR TAX RATE IS TOO HIGH --

01:43:34.141 --> 01:43:35.776
I'M SOMEBODY IS SAID IN FACT I

01:43:35.842 --> 01:43:37.177
HEAR ALL THE TIME HERE IN THIS

01:43:37.244 --> 01:43:38.312
BUILDING THAT WE SHOULD BE

01:43:38.378 --> 01:43:40.714
PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS AND

01:43:40.781 --> 01:43:44.184
YET GUESS WHAT WE DO -- WE PICK

01:43:44.251 --> 01:43:45.018
WINNERS AND LOSERS.

01:43:45.085 --> 01:43:46.620
AND I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

01:43:46.687 --> 01:43:48.121
FOR THIS LEGISLATURE GOT TO BE

01:43:48.188 --> 01:43:49.790
RESPONSIBLE TO ACTUALLY OUR JOB

01:43:49.856 --> 01:43:51.191
AND THAT'S WHERE MISTER GRAY GOT

01:43:51.258 --> 01:43:52.926
ME IS ACTUALLY OUR JOB TO DO

01:43:52.993 --> 01:43:54.795
THAT THE REASON I JUST I WANT TO

01:43:54.861 --> 01:43:56.196
BE ON THE REVENUE TAX COMMITTEE.

01:43:56.263 --> 01:43:57.698
WAS BECAUSE I HEARD BACK IN

01:43:57.764 --> 01:43:58.699
DECEMBER THAT WE WERE THAT

01:43:58.765 --> 01:44:00.000
THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT THE

01:44:00.067 --> 01:44:00.968
ADMINISTRATION WANTED TO DO

01:44:01.034 --> 01:44:02.603
COMPREHENSIVE TAX REFORM AND I

01:44:02.669 --> 01:44:03.537
WANTED TO BE A PART.

01:44:03.604 --> 01:44:04.771
OF THAT OF THAT CONVERSATION

01:44:04.838 --> 01:44:06.573
BECAUSE OF MY BACKGROUND IT IS

01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:07.941
OUR JOB TO DO THAT.

01:44:08.008 --> 01:44:09.943
IN ADDITION TO NOT JUST GOING IN

01:44:10.010 --> 01:44:11.211
STUDYING AND UNDERSTANDING --

01:44:11.278 --> 01:44:12.613
WHETHER WE HAVE TOO MANY

01:44:12.679 --> 01:44:14.514
CORPORATE LOOPHOLES -- BUT

01:44:14.581 --> 01:44:15.616
THERE'S ALSO THE QUESTION OF

01:44:15.682 --> 01:44:16.650
WHETHER WE SPEND TOO MUCH MONEY

01:44:16.717 --> 01:44:18.185
AND PROGRAMS WHETHER THERE'S AN

01:44:18.251 --> 01:44:19.620
EFFICACY WITH THE DOLLARS THAT

01:44:19.686 --> 01:44:21.254
WE SPENT I'M SO I THINK PARTLY

01:44:21.321 --> 01:44:23.523
THIS IS A BIT INCOMPLETE AS WELL.

01:44:23.590 --> 01:44:25.292
IT IS OUR JOB AS THE LEGISLATURE

01:44:25.359 --> 01:44:27.494
TO DO TO DO THIS WORK WE

01:44:27.561 --> 01:44:29.129
SHOULDN'T KEEP.

01:44:29.196 --> 01:44:30.430
YOU KNO DELEGATING THIS TO

01:44:30.497 --> 01:44:32.032
OTHER -- COMMISSIONS IN KING

01:44:32.099 --> 01:44:33.467
COUNCILS WE HAVE TOO MANY OF

01:44:33.533 --> 01:44:35.402
THEM ALREADY AND IN LARGE PART

01:44:35.469 --> 01:44:37.170
IT'S BECAUSE AS A BODY WE DON'T

01:44:37.237 --> 01:44:38.338
HAVE THE COURAGE TO MAKE

01:44:38.405 --> 01:44:39.706
DECISIONS THAT ARE THAT ARE

01:44:39.773 --> 01:44:40.841
DIFFICULT.

01:44:40.907 --> 01:44:41.575
AND FOR THAT REASON I'M GONNA

01:44:41.642 --> 01:44:43.443
LAY OFF TODAY AS WELL IF I IF I

01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:45.612
COULD JUST KEEP ASKING KEEP AN

01:44:45.679 --> 01:44:46.813
OPEN MIND SHOP OF THE SECOND

01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:47.481
COURSE I WILL.

01:44:47.547 --> 01:44:50.117
THE FIRST IS THE DATA THE SECOND

01:44:50.183 --> 01:44:52.052
IS THE ANALYSIS IF YOU WILL THE

01:44:52.119 --> 01:44:54.354
THIRD IS IT IS COMING BACK TO

01:44:54.421 --> 01:44:57.290
THE LEGISLATURE AND HOPEFULLY IT

01:44:57.357 --> 01:44:59.893
WILL BE -- INFORMATION THAT CAN

01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:02.029
THEN BE PROPERLY ANALYZED BY

01:45:02.095 --> 01:45:04.064
THIS COMMITTEE.

01:45:04.131 --> 01:45:05.732
AND BY THE SENATE COMMITTEE.

01:45:05.799 --> 01:45:07.467
IN CONJUNCTION AND HOLDING

01:45:07.534 --> 01:45:10.570
PUBLIC HEARINGS AT WHICH POINT.

01:45:10.637 --> 01:45:11.571
EITHER WAY.

01:45:11.638 --> 01:45:12.906
YOU CAN CHOOSE WHEN WE CAN

01:45:12.973 --> 01:45:15.208
CHOOSE AS A LEGISLATURE TO ACT

01:45:15.275 --> 01:45:17.010
OR NOT ACT AND WE CAN ACT ANY%

01:45:17.077 --> 01:45:18.912
WAY WE WANT WE'RE NOT BOUND BY

01:45:18.979 --> 01:45:20.247
ANYTHING.

01:45:20.313 --> 01:45:21.782
THAT IS GOING TO COME TO US

01:45:21.848 --> 01:45:23.784
BASICALLY I SEE IT AS A WAY TO

01:45:23.850 --> 01:45:25.686
HELP US FOCUS.

01:45:25.752 --> 01:45:27.721
BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T DONE THIS.

01:45:27.788 --> 01:45:28.288
YOU KNOW THERE ARE THERE TAX

01:45:28.355 --> 01:45:29.856
CREDIT SHELTER FROM THE NINETEEN

01:45:29.923 --> 01:45:31.091
FORTIES.

01:45:31.158 --> 01:45:32.559
WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES HERE

01:45:32.626 --> 01:45:33.427
IN FACT THAT'S ONE OF THE

01:45:33.493 --> 01:45:35.162
REASONS WE MOVED THE RESEARCH

01:45:35.228 --> 01:45:36.997
FROM THE LA ALL. TO THE

01:45:37.064 --> 01:45:37.931
UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA'S BECAUSE

01:45:37.998 --> 01:45:39.366
WE DON'T OF THE RESEARCH

01:45:39.433 --> 01:45:41.134
MECHANISM HERE TO DO THAT IT

01:45:41.201 --> 01:45:43.236
RESEARCH TO FIND OUT JUST WHAT

01:45:43.303 --> 01:45:45.338
THESE TAX CREDITS ARE AND HOW

01:45:45.405 --> 01:45:46.206
THEY HAVE.

01:45:46.273 --> 01:45:48.408
IMPACTED HOW THEY'VE COMPLIED OR

01:45:48.475 --> 01:45:50.544
OR PERFORM BASED UPON THEIR

01:45:50.610 --> 01:45:52.879
INTENDED PURPOSE SO THAT'S THE

01:45:52.946 --> 01:45:54.614
FIRST STEP THE SECOND IS THAT

01:45:54.681 --> 01:45:56.416
INFORMATION WILL THEN COME TO

01:45:56.483 --> 01:45:59.753
THIS GROUP OF OF EXPERTS IF YOU

01:45:59.820 --> 01:46:00.520
WILL WHO ARE ELECTED BUT

01:46:00.587 --> 01:46:02.122
ARGUABLY BUREAUCRATS I GUESS YOU

01:46:02.189 --> 01:46:03.223
COULD SAY THEY RUN.

01:46:03.290 --> 01:46:04.758
DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS WHERE

01:46:04.825 --> 01:46:06.827
THERE IS A CERTAIN EXPERTISE AND

01:46:06.893 --> 01:46:08.128
IT IS THEN BROUGHT TO WATCH AS A

01:46:08.195 --> 01:46:10.630
LEGISLATURE. TO DO WITH AS WE

01:46:10.697 --> 01:46:12.165
WISH TO DO WITH SO THERE WERE

01:46:12.232 --> 01:46:14.668
RESPONDING TO OUR CONSTITUENTS

01:46:14.735 --> 01:46:16.036
TO THE PRIORITIES THAT WE HAVE

01:46:16.103 --> 01:46:17.604
IS A STATE TO THE ISSUES THAT

01:46:17.671 --> 01:46:19.973
ARE COMING BEFORE US AT THE TIME.

01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:21.742
I WILL TELL YOU TEN YEARS AGO WE

01:46:21.808 --> 01:46:24.377
WEREN'T LOOKING FOR MONEY TO DO

01:46:24.444 --> 01:46:29.850
TO ADDRESS THE HOMELESSNESS

01:46:29.916 --> 01:46:30.383
PROBLEM BUT WE ARE TODAY.

01:46:30.450 --> 01:46:32.385
AND WHO KNOWS WHAT IT'LL BE IN A

01:46:32.452 --> 01:46:33.053
YEAR OR TWO OR FIVE BUT IT WILL

01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:33.653
BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:35.756
LEGISLATURE. TO MAKE THOSE FINAL

01:46:35.822 --> 01:46:37.424
DECISION SO WE'RE NOT ABROGATING

01:46:37.491 --> 01:46:39.826
RESPONSIBILITIES TO ANYBODY ELSE

01:46:39.893 --> 01:46:40.994
THEY ARE PROVIDING US WITH THE

01:46:41.061 --> 01:46:43.263
INFORMATION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

01:46:43.330 --> 01:46:45.232
WHICH WE CAN ACCEPT OR WE CAN

01:46:45.298 --> 01:46:46.199
REJECT.

01:46:46.266 --> 01:46:47.601
AND I AND THE IDEA THAT WE THEN

01:46:47.667 --> 01:46:49.369
ALLOW THE PUBLIC PUBLIC COMMENT

01:46:49.436 --> 01:46:51.338
SO THAT WE CAN GET INPUT FROM

01:46:51.404 --> 01:46:53.874
THOSE WHO DISAGREE. FOR THOSE

01:46:53.940 --> 01:46:55.041
WHO HAVE OTHER THOUGHTS AND

01:46:55.108 --> 01:46:56.510
SUGGESTIONS THAT WILL COME

01:46:56.576 --> 01:46:58.145
BEFORE THIS BODY FOR THE

01:46:58.211 --> 01:47:00.547
ULTIMATE DETERMINATION WE'RE NOT

01:47:00.614 --> 01:47:02.349
WE'RE NOT GIVING AWAY.

01:47:02.415 --> 01:47:04.684
ANY OF OUR RESPONSIBILITIES I

01:47:04.751 --> 01:47:06.820
BELIEVE WITH AT THE WAY THAT

01:47:06.887 --> 01:47:08.588
WE'VE TRIED TO SET THIS UP.

01:47:08.655 --> 01:47:10.223
ULTIMATELY THE BOTTOM LINE IS IT

01:47:10.290 --> 01:47:11.491
WILL BE UP TO WATCHES A

01:47:11.558 --> 01:47:12.859
LEGISLATURE TO MAKE THOSE

01:47:12.926 --> 01:47:14.628
IMPORTANT PUBLIC POLICY

01:47:14.694 --> 01:47:16.329
DECISIONS.

01:47:16.396 --> 01:47:18.165
IN THAT I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH

01:47:18.231 --> 01:47:18.999
YOU WITH ALL OF THAT I THINK

01:47:19.065 --> 01:47:20.867
JUST THE QUESTION IS WE OFTEN

01:47:20.934 --> 01:47:21.668
HAVE THESE DO THESE STUDIES

01:47:21.735 --> 01:47:23.136
MAYES ARE SET ON THE SHELF AND

01:47:23.203 --> 01:47:24.905
AND DO NOTHING THE UC CAN DO

01:47:24.971 --> 01:47:25.806
THIS WORK THE LEGISLATIVE

01:47:25.872 --> 01:47:27.073
ANALYST'S OFFICE ALREADY HAS THE

01:47:27.140 --> 01:47:28.742
CAPACITY TO BE ABLE. TO DO SOME

01:47:28.809 --> 01:47:30.210
OF THIS WORK AND I I FEEL AS

01:47:30.277 --> 01:47:31.878
THOUGH THIS IS SORT OF A A PASS

01:47:31.945 --> 01:47:34.214
FOR US THAT WE WE WE GO WELL GO

01:47:34.281 --> 01:47:35.081
STUDY IT BUT THEN WE DON'T DO

01:47:35.148 --> 01:47:35.582
MUCH.

01:47:35.649 --> 01:47:37.317
ABOUT IT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT

01:47:37.384 --> 01:47:39.085
HOW MUCH WE SPEND OUR DOLLARS

01:47:39.152 --> 01:47:40.787
AND I DON'T THINK WE WE GET THE

01:47:40.854 --> 01:47:41.955
MOST EFFICIENT BANG FOR OUR BUCK

01:47:42.022 --> 01:47:43.323
IN THE WAY WE SPEND MONEY.

01:47:43.390 --> 01:47:44.825
NOR DO I THINK THAT WE ARE OUR

01:47:44.891 --> 01:47:47.093
TAX SYSTEM -- GENERATE THE

01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:48.862
REVENUE THAT WE NEED TO BE

01:47:48.929 --> 01:47:49.496
COMPETITIVE IN A GLOBAL

01:47:49.563 --> 01:47:51.898
MARKETPLACE -- SO AGAIN I THINK

01:47:51.965 --> 01:47:53.500
THAT IT IS INCUMBENT UPON US TO

01:47:53.567 --> 01:47:55.936
DO THAT WORK I JUST DON'T WANT

01:47:56.002 --> 01:47:58.738
TO TO TO DISH THAT OFF TO

01:47:58.805 --> 01:47:59.072
SOMEBODY ELSE.

01:47:59.139 --> 01:47:59.906
I'M.

01:47:59.973 --> 01:48:00.407
REALLY QUICKLY JUST FOR

01:48:00.473 --> 01:48:01.708
CLARIFICATION PURPOSES WE DID

01:48:01.775 --> 01:48:02.943
LOOK AT THE LA L. -- BECAUSE WE

01:48:03.009 --> 01:48:03.910
DO THE COMMITTEE FELT LIKE THE

01:48:03.977 --> 01:48:05.278
LA -- WAS PROBABLY THE BEST

01:48:05.345 --> 01:48:06.413
PLACE SOME PLACE THAT WE ALL

01:48:06.479 --> 01:48:07.480
TRUST THE LA -- DIDN'T HAVE THE

01:48:07.547 --> 01:48:08.882
CAPACITY NOR DO WE HAVE THE

01:48:08.949 --> 01:48:11.218
CAPACITY TO FIND THEM IN A WAY

01:48:11.284 --> 01:48:13.119
THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM THE THE

01:48:13.186 --> 01:48:14.821
STAFFING TO DO THIS THEY WOULD

01:48:14.888 --> 01:48:16.456
HAVE TO DO ONE OF BECAUSE THESE

01:48:16.523 --> 01:48:17.424
ARE SUCH LARGE INSTEAD BECAUSE

01:48:17.490 --> 01:48:18.692
THEY'RE SO CONFERENCE IF.

01:48:18.758 --> 01:48:20.393
THEY WOULD ONLY BE ABLE TO DO

01:48:20.460 --> 01:48:22.229
ONE A YEAR AND THAT WE DID NOT

01:48:22.295 --> 01:48:23.563
FEEL AS EFFICIENT WHICH IS WHY

01:48:23.630 --> 01:48:25.265
WE MOVED IT OUT OF THE LA --

01:48:25.332 --> 01:48:26.266
JUST SO THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND

01:48:26.333 --> 01:48:28.168
THAT ELLIE -- WAS THE INITIAL --

01:48:28.235 --> 01:48:29.669
WAS THE INITIAL CONCEPT IT THEY

01:48:29.736 --> 01:48:30.770
JUST DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY NOR

01:48:30.837 --> 01:48:32.305
DO WE HAVE THE FUNDING MECHANISM

01:48:32.372 --> 01:48:34.241
IN PLACE TO ALLOW OURSELVES TO

01:48:34.307 --> 01:48:36.042
FIND THEM TO MAKE THEM.

01:48:36.109 --> 01:48:38.778
CAPABLE OF DOING IT ASSEMBLY

01:48:38.845 --> 01:48:41.181
MEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS.

01:48:41.248 --> 01:48:42.115
SAID SENATOR LIKE YOU AND LIKE

01:48:42.182 --> 01:48:42.716
MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES I WOULD

01:48:42.782 --> 01:48:43.383
SAY I THINK WE NEED TO DO A MUCH

01:48:43.450 --> 01:48:45.018
BETTER JOB AND ENSURING THAT

01:48:45.085 --> 01:48:46.353
WE'RE SPENDING OUR TAXPAYER

01:48:46.419 --> 01:48:47.854
DOLLARS EFFICIENTLY AND

01:48:47.921 --> 01:48:48.622
EFFECTIVELY.

01:48:48.688 --> 01:48:50.190
SOMEONE WHO WAS NOT ELECTED A

01:48:50.257 --> 01:48:51.825
HUNDRED YEARS AGO ACTUALLY QUITE

01:48:51.892 --> 01:48:52.893
RECENTLY.

01:48:52.959 --> 01:48:55.262
NOT SERRATION I'VE HAD IS YOU

01:48:55.328 --> 01:48:56.930
KNOW WE PASS A LOT OF LINES.

01:48:56.997 --> 01:48:57.430
WE HAVE A LOT OF PRESS

01:48:57.497 --> 01:48:59.165
CONFERENCES AND WE DON'T ALWAYS

01:48:59.232 --> 01:49:00.734
DO A GOOD JOB AT LOOKING BACK

01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:01.835
AND SAYING.

01:49:01.902 --> 01:49:03.303
IS THAT MONEY GOING WHERE IT WAS

01:49:03.370 --> 01:49:05.071
INTENDED TO GO IS THAT MONEY

01:49:05.138 --> 01:49:06.406
HAVING THE IMPACT IT WAS

01:49:06.473 --> 01:49:08.341
INTENDED TO HAVE I'M SO I WOULD

01:49:08.408 --> 01:49:10.243
I WOULD ECHO ADD ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:11.578
MAYES COMMENTS.

01:49:11.645 --> 01:49:14.414
TERMS OF THIS ONE BEING PART OF

01:49:14.481 --> 01:49:14.948
THE EQUATION RIGHT TO THE

01:49:15.015 --> 01:49:15.482
SUCCESS.

01:49:15.548 --> 01:49:16.616
AT TAX EXPENDITURES THERE'S A

01:49:16.683 --> 01:49:17.918
WHOLE LOT OF OTHER EXPENDITURES

01:49:17.984 --> 01:49:19.352
I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE A MUCH.

01:49:19.419 --> 01:49:22.622
MUCH BETTER LOOK AT AND I WILL

01:49:22.689 --> 01:49:23.556
BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY I

01:49:23.623 --> 01:49:25.458
ASSURE SOME OF THE CONCERNS

01:49:25.525 --> 01:49:26.927
AROUND FIVE UNITS THE

01:49:26.993 --> 01:49:29.763
BUREAUCRACY AND MAKE SURE THAT.

01:49:29.829 --> 01:49:31.298
THIS ISN'T JUST SOME THE REPORT

01:49:31.364 --> 01:49:32.866
THAT SITS ON THE SHELF BUT I

01:49:32.933 --> 01:49:34.167
ALSO THINK THAT THE ONLY WAY

01:49:34.234 --> 01:49:34.801
WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE

01:49:34.868 --> 01:49:36.803
BETTER DECISIONS IS BY HAVING

01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:38.338
BETTER DATA SO I WILL BE

01:49:38.405 --> 01:49:38.772
SUPPORTING.

01:49:38.838 --> 01:49:44.377
I FEEL VERY CONFIDENT THAT THE

01:49:44.444 --> 01:49:45.345
EDUCATION COMMUNITY.

01:49:45.412 --> 01:49:46.780
WILL NOT LET THIS **** ON A

01:49:46.846 --> 01:49:47.013
SHELF.

01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:48.615
ESPECIALLY IF THERE ARE

01:49:48.682 --> 01:49:51.017
RESOURCES THAT ARE BEING

01:49:51.084 --> 01:49:52.652
INAPPROPRIATELY AT LEAST FROM

01:49:52.719 --> 01:49:54.587
THEIR PERSPECTIVE SPENT AND

01:49:54.654 --> 01:49:56.056
THERE WILL BE A VERY ROBUST

01:49:56.122 --> 01:49:57.624
DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS GOING

01:49:57.691 --> 01:49:58.558
FORWARD.

01:49:58.625 --> 01:50:00.193
AS THERE SHOULD BE AND I AGREE

01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:02.495
THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT AREAS

01:50:02.562 --> 01:50:05.131
THIS IS ONE CHUNK OF A PROBLEM

01:50:05.198 --> 01:50:07.133
BECAUSE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:08.969
FINANCE INDICATES THAT.

01:50:09.035 --> 01:50:11.237
BY TWENTY TWENTY ONE THERE WILL

01:50:11.304 --> 01:50:13.974
HAVE BEEN A FIVE HUNDRED AND SIX

01:50:14.040 --> 01:50:16.676
POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLAR LOSS

01:50:16.743 --> 01:50:18.611
IN REVENUE TO THE GENERAL FUND

01:50:18.678 --> 01:50:20.146
SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT

01:50:20.213 --> 01:50:21.448
THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.

01:50:21.514 --> 01:50:22.716
AND THAT'S MONEY AT GOING

01:50:22.782 --> 01:50:24.684
FORWARD THAT UNLESS IT'S REALLY

01:50:24.751 --> 01:50:27.354
SERVING ITS DESIGN PURPOSE AS WE

01:50:27.420 --> 01:50:28.989
THE LEGISLATURE.

01:50:29.055 --> 01:50:30.724
DETERMINE -- THEN IT'S MONEY

01:50:30.790 --> 01:50:32.425
THAT IS NOT BEING A PROPERLY

01:50:32.492 --> 01:50:34.327
SPENT TWO TO RESPOND TO THE

01:50:34.394 --> 01:50:37.931
TAXPAYER WHICH IS OUR ONE OF OUR

01:50:37.998 --> 01:50:39.632
PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES AS WELL

01:50:39.699 --> 01:50:39.933
[inaudible]

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.268
MR TANG.

01:50:42.335 --> 01:50:43.703
THANK YOU MA'AM TRUMP'S GONNA

01:50:43.770 --> 01:50:45.839
PICK UP ON WHERE ARE CHAIR OF

01:50:45.905 --> 01:50:47.173
SORTS LEFT OFF I THINK THIS --

01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:48.008
THIS TYPE OF LOOK IS LONG

01:50:48.074 --> 01:50:50.910
OVERDUE WE DON'T WE DON'T EVER

01:50:50.977 --> 01:50:52.512
LOOK AT TAXES WE CANNOT I I

01:50:52.579 --> 01:50:53.046
PROBABLY HAVE THE LARGEST

01:50:53.113 --> 01:50:54.047
COMMITTEE STAFFER BUDGET

01:50:54.114 --> 01:50:55.682
COMMITTEE WE DON'T HAVE.

01:50:55.749 --> 01:50:57.617
ANYBODY WHO REALLY IS THERE

01:50:57.684 --> 01:50:59.853
FOCUSED ON JUST LOOKING AT TAX

01:50:59.919 --> 01:51:01.287
EXPENDITURES EVEN THOUGH TWO

01:51:01.354 --> 01:51:02.122
HUGE.

01:51:02.188 --> 01:51:03.490
PORTION OF OUR BUDGET EVERY

01:51:03.556 --> 01:51:06.593
SINGLE YEAR -- IN ADDITION AS A

01:51:06.659 --> 01:51:08.194
CHAIR MENTIONED ALEJO'S NOT

01:51:08.261 --> 01:51:08.595
STAFF WITH THIS.

01:51:08.661 --> 01:51:10.630
AND I THINK IT IS LONG OVERDUE

01:51:10.697 --> 01:51:11.998
THAT WE DO.

01:51:12.065 --> 01:51:14.000
TAKE A HARD LOOK AT MONEY THAT

01:51:14.067 --> 01:51:15.568
WE ARE APPROPRIATING EVERY

01:51:15.635 --> 01:51:18.171
SINGLE YEAR BUT WE DON'T REALLY

01:51:18.238 --> 01:51:18.805
APPROPRIATE DOESN'T GO THROUGH

01:51:18.872 --> 01:51:19.572
COMMITTEE.

01:51:19.639 --> 01:51:21.141
DOESN'T REALLY GO THROUGH A

01:51:21.207 --> 01:51:22.542
BUDGET BILL SO JUST GIVE ME

01:51:22.609 --> 01:51:24.611
SCRUTINY IT DOESN'T REALLY GET

01:51:24.677 --> 01:51:27.313
THE KIND OF THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS

01:51:27.380 --> 01:51:28.815
THAT WE NEED.

01:51:28.882 --> 01:51:31.451
SO I I REALLY APPRECIATE -- YOU

01:51:31.518 --> 01:51:34.654
GET TO STAB AT IT -- HI I'M I

01:51:34.721 --> 01:51:40.093
HAVE A COUPLE -- UP YOU KNOW.

01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:40.693
DIFFERENCES DOWN THE ROAD BUT

01:51:40.760 --> 01:51:41.661
OVERALL I THINK THIS IS GREAT TO

01:51:41.728 --> 01:51:43.129
ACTUALLY TAKE A HARD LOOK.

01:51:43.196 --> 01:51:44.764
AT WHAT OUR WHAT OUR TAX DOLLARS

01:51:44.831 --> 01:51:46.066
ARE GOING TO HOW THEY'RE BEING

01:51:46.132 --> 01:51:47.100
SPENT.

01:51:47.167 --> 01:51:49.302
AS AS MR PARK SAID HE IS THE

01:51:49.369 --> 01:51:50.937
MONEY ACTUALLY GETTING THE KIND

01:51:51.004 --> 01:51:52.572
OF RESULT.

01:51:52.639 --> 01:51:53.339
WE THOUGHT IT WOULD IN THE

01:51:53.406 --> 01:51:55.408
ANALYSIS ON YOU KNOW I'M I'M

01:51:55.475 --> 01:51:57.377
LIKE MR MAYS I'M NOT A HUGE FAN

01:51:57.444 --> 01:51:58.645
A TAX CREDITS BY FOR MYSELF

01:51:58.711 --> 01:52:01.047
VOTING FOR YOU KNOW.

01:52:01.114 --> 01:52:02.916
A LOT MORE THAN I'D LIKE OR THAT

01:52:02.982 --> 01:52:03.917
I DON'T THINK I SHOULD PARTLY

01:52:03.983 --> 01:52:05.752
BECAUSE WHEN YOU WHEN YOU GET

01:52:05.819 --> 01:52:08.755
THE TAX CREDIT.

01:52:08.822 --> 01:52:10.156
THERE WAS ALSO A GOOD IDEA.

01:52:10.223 --> 01:52:12.826
WE WE ALMOST RARELY UNLESS WE

01:52:12.892 --> 01:52:14.127
SANTA SET THEM NOW WE'VE GONE TO

01:52:14.194 --> 01:52:14.727
A GOOD HABIT OF DOING THAT.

01:52:14.794 --> 01:52:16.162
EVER LOOK BACK TEN YEARS LATER

01:52:16.229 --> 01:52:18.298
HEY DID ACTUALLY WORK TO DO THE

01:52:18.364 --> 01:52:20.900
ANALYSIS THAT SAID HE WAS GOING

01:52:20.967 --> 01:52:22.435
TO WORK ACTUALLY PAY OFF I THINK.

01:52:22.502 --> 01:52:23.837
THAT THIS IS ON LONG OVERDUE TO

01:52:23.903 --> 01:52:25.271
EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT I

01:52:25.338 --> 01:52:26.573
THINK IT'S VERY FISCALLY

01:52:26.639 --> 01:52:28.007
RESPONSIBLE BECAUSE IT IS THE

01:52:28.074 --> 01:52:29.742
LARGEST PART OF OUR BUDGET THAT

01:52:29.809 --> 01:52:34.781
WE NEVER LOOK AT NEVER.

01:52:34.848 --> 01:52:36.850
SO I THINK IT IS -- REALLY

01:52:36.916 --> 01:52:39.252
PUSHING.

01:52:39.319 --> 01:52:40.820
YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD

01:52:40.887 --> 01:52:42.822

BILL LIKE MR TANG I THINK --

01:52:47.393 --> 01:52:49.028
THIS KIND OF A COMPREHENSIVE

01:52:49.095 --> 01:52:51.764
REVIEW IS OVERDUE -- IT'S

01:52:51.831 --> 01:52:53.700
WELCOMED.

01:52:53.766 --> 01:52:56.469
A DEEP LOOK AT THE VALUE OF

01:52:56.536 --> 01:52:58.138
THESE TAX EXPENDITURES GIVEN

01:52:58.204 --> 01:53:00.240
SORT OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE

01:53:00.306 --> 01:53:03.176
OVERALL BUDGET.

01:53:03.243 --> 01:53:03.977

ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE FAVORABLE.

01:53:17.490 --> 01:53:21.528
FOR THESE KINDS OF JOBS BUT I

01:53:21.594 --> 01:53:22.862
MYSELF HAVE NOT DONE IT.

01:53:22.929 --> 01:53:26.099
DEEP LOOK AT THE OVERALL VALUE

01:53:26.166 --> 01:53:29.302
SO IT IS WORTHY TO HAVE THE TO

01:53:29.369 --> 01:53:31.504
HAVE THE CONVERSATION.

01:53:31.571 --> 01:53:33.473

EQUIVALENT BODY OF THE SENATE

THAT WE WILL LOOK AT EACH AND

01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:42.582
EVERYONE OF THE SITE.

01:53:42.649 --> 01:53:44.317
IS IT YOUR EXPECTATION THAT WE

01:53:44.384 --> 01:53:45.852
WILL HAVE HEARINGS BUT IT'S NOT

01:53:45.919 --> 01:53:46.553
AS THOUGH WE'RE GOING TO BE

01:53:46.619 --> 01:53:48.688
LOOKING AT AN OMNIBUS PIECE OF

01:53:48.755 --> 01:53:50.223
LEGISLATION WITH ALL OF THESE

01:53:50.290 --> 01:53:51.558
RECOMMENDATIONS WRAPPED UP LIKE.

01:53:51.624 --> 01:53:53.092
OCCASIONALLY WILL HAVE BLUE

01:53:53.159 --> 01:53:54.594
RIBBON TASK FORCE AND SO FORTH

01:53:54.661 --> 01:53:56.930
AND AND A OF A BIG PIECE OF

01:53:56.996 --> 01:53:57.897
LEGISLATION THAT'S ALL

01:53:57.964 --> 01:53:59.432
ENCOMPASSING MY EXPECTATION.

01:53:59.499 --> 01:54:00.700
IS THAT WE WILL LOOK AT EACH AND

01:54:00.767 --> 01:54:02.101
EVERYONE OF THESE LIKE WE

01:54:02.168 --> 01:54:04.404
NORMALLY DO HI IN THE

01:54:04.470 --> 01:54:06.005
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS.

01:54:06.072 --> 01:54:08.575
TO TO EVALUATE THE REPORT --

01:54:08.641 --> 01:54:10.843
BITE AT MY EXPECTATION IS THAT

01:54:10.910 --> 01:54:13.079
THIS COMMITTEE IN PERFORMING ITS

01:54:13.146 --> 01:54:15.114
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT WILL ALSO

01:54:15.181 --> 01:54:17.550
BRING IN OTHER FOLKS NOT

01:54:17.617 --> 01:54:19.619
INCLUDED IN THE PREVIOUS PROCESS --

01:54:19.686 --> 01:54:21.754
BECAUSE EACH ONE OF THESE -- I

01:54:21.821 --> 01:54:24.891
THINK ON THE MERITS -- ABROAD

01:54:24.958 --> 01:54:27.360
REVIEW BY THIS BODY -- TO ACT AS

01:54:27.427 --> 01:54:29.529
SOMETHING OF A CHECK FRANKLY ON

01:54:29.596 --> 01:54:31.731
THE OUTSIDE A REPORT AND THAT'S

01:54:31.798 --> 01:54:34.634
GENERALLY HOW THESE THINGS WORK

01:54:34.701 --> 01:54:36.169
WITH THAT THAT'S CORRECT YEAH.

01:54:36.236 --> 01:54:37.604
THE ONCE THAT THIS IS A WE'RE

01:54:37.670 --> 01:54:38.605
SETTING UP A PROCESS.

01:54:38.671 --> 01:54:39.138
AND THEN IT COMES TO THE

01:54:39.205 --> 01:54:41.040
LEGISLATURE THE ONLY PART OF

01:54:41.107 --> 01:54:43.209
THAT LEGISLATIVE PROCESS.

01:54:43.276 --> 01:54:45.912
IS THAT WE WE CALL FOR JOINT

01:54:45.979 --> 01:54:49.916
HEARINGS -- FOR THE REV REVENUE

01:54:49.983 --> 01:54:50.550
TAX.

01:54:50.617 --> 01:54:52.452
A COMMITTEES TO GET TOGETHER AND

01:54:52.518 --> 01:54:54.153
TO HAVE SOME PUBLIC HEARINGS

01:54:54.220 --> 01:54:55.755
WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT.

01:54:55.822 --> 01:54:57.657
REALLY THERE THE BILL IS SILENT

01:54:57.724 --> 01:54:59.692
BECAUSE I EXPECT THERE WHAT WILL

01:54:59.759 --> 01:55:01.261
HAPPEN IN PROBABLY WHAT SHOULD

01:55:01.327 --> 01:55:02.862
HAPPEN IS EACH ONE OF THESE WILL

01:55:02.929 --> 01:55:04.430
BE CONSIDERED ON THEIR OWN

01:55:04.497 --> 01:55:06.099
MERITS FOR EXAMPLE THE ARE

01:55:06.165 --> 01:55:07.066
INDEED CREDIT.

01:55:07.133 --> 01:55:08.534
LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE SO

01:55:08.601 --> 01:55:10.069
THAT THAT SO IT'S REALLY CLEAR I

01:55:10.136 --> 01:55:12.472
THINK WAS IN TWENTY FOURTEEN OR

01:55:12.538 --> 01:55:18.645
AT SOME POINT WE DID A TAX

01:55:18.711 --> 01:55:19.212
CREDIT FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT

01:55:19.279 --> 01:55:19.779
BUSINESS.

01:55:19.846 --> 01:55:21.014
AND WE SAIDOKAY WE'RE GOING TO

01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:21.981
GIVE YOU THIS TAX CREDIT BUT YOU

01:55:22.048 --> 01:55:22.582
GOTTA COME BACK IT'S GOING TO

01:55:22.649 --> 01:55:23.049
SUNSET.

01:55:23.116 --> 01:55:24.617
UNLESS YOU COME BACK AND SHOW US

01:55:24.684 --> 01:55:25.451
WHY.

01:55:25.518 --> 01:55:26.986
THIS HAS BEEN A BENEFIT TO THE

01:55:27.053 --> 01:55:28.821
STATE OF CALIFORNIA YOU'RE GOING

01:55:28.888 --> 01:55:30.523
TO HAVE TO MAKE YOUR CASE WELL

01:55:30.590 --> 01:55:31.758
NOT ONLY DID THEY MAKE THEIR

01:55:31.824 --> 01:55:32.959
CASE THEY MADE THEIR CASE SO

01:55:33.026 --> 01:55:34.260
WELL THAT WE DOUBLE THE TAX

01:55:34.327 --> 01:55:35.194
CREDIT.

01:55:35.261 --> 01:55:37.096
BECAUSE OF THAT WHAT WHAT WAS

01:55:37.163 --> 01:55:40.633
ESTABLISHED TO BE THE BENEFIT UP

01:55:40.700 --> 01:55:41.834
FOR EVERY DOLLAR THAT WE GAVE IT

01:55:41.901 --> 01:55:44.037
A TAX CREDIT WE GOT SIX DOLLARS

01:55:44.103 --> 01:55:45.972
BACKERS SOME NUMBER.

01:55:46.039 --> 01:55:47.707
AND AND I THINK THAT AND NOW

01:55:47.774 --> 01:55:49.475
WITH EVERY TAX CREDIT WE DO FROM

01:55:49.542 --> 01:55:51.711
I THINK TWENTY FOURTEEN ON WE

01:55:51.778 --> 01:55:53.546
REQUIRE THAT SAME PROCESS FOR

01:55:53.613 --> 01:55:55.148
THOSE IT HAPPENED BEFORE THAT WE

01:55:55.214 --> 01:55:56.482
HAVE NO PROCESS.

01:55:56.549 --> 01:55:58.451
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL TRIES

01:55:58.518 --> 01:55:59.519
TO DO.

01:55:59.585 --> 01:56:01.321
IS TO IS BASICALLY TURNED US SET

01:56:01.387 --> 01:56:04.724

ACCOUNTING -- COMMENDATION OR

01:56:08.995 --> 01:56:11.264

02:00:15.107 --> 02:00:15.608
ENERGY THAT'S NOT GOING TO

02:00:15.675 --> 02:00:17.243
CHANGE THE WAY THIS COMMITTEE --

02:00:17.310 --> 02:00:20.179

02:00:20.246 --> 02:00:21.447
THAT TO MY COLLEGE IN THE BAY

02:00:21.514 --> 02:00:24.283
AREA LIKE THE RD TAX CREDIT.

02:00:24.350 --> 02:00:27.453
I'M SHOCKED -- YOUR THAT THE

02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:29.355
THESE THINGS REQUIRE ADVOCACY

02:00:29.422 --> 02:00:30.489
AND THE INFORMATION IS READILY

02:00:30.556 --> 02:00:32.425
AVAILABLE NOW IN THE PUBLIC AND

02:00:32.491 --> 02:00:33.659
THEIR OPPOSING SIDES OF

02:00:33.726 --> 02:00:34.627
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON EACH

02:00:34.694 --> 02:00:35.261
ISSUE.

02:00:35.328 --> 02:00:35.962
AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE

02:00:36.028 --> 02:00:38.030
COMMITTEES AND THE IRONY OF

02:00:38.097 --> 02:00:38.698
SITTING IN THE REVAN TALKED TO

02:00:38.764 --> 02:00:41.067
ME AND SAID ASSEMBLY AND SAY WE

02:00:41.133 --> 02:00:42.335
GOT A PART.

02:00:42.401 --> 02:00:45.304
ON THIS POLICY OF WHAT OUR TAX

02:00:45.371 --> 02:00:47.173
EXPENDITURES ARE IS ABSURD.

02:00:47.239 --> 02:00:50.676
SO AFTER LISTEN TO THE BAD I

02:00:50.743 --> 02:00:51.777
LIVE CLOSE THE DOOR NO THEN --

02:00:51.844 --> 02:00:53.045
THEN THE YES BUT I'M STILL GOING

02:00:53.112 --> 02:00:54.747
TO ABSTAINED BECAUSE AGAIN I

02:00:54.814 --> 02:00:56.716
THINK -- THE UNDERLYING PREMISE

02:00:56.782 --> 02:00:57.316
THAT YOU'RE APPROACHING THIS

02:00:57.383 --> 02:00:58.351

02:00:58.417 --> 02:01:02.455

02:01:02.521 --> 02:01:03.456
INTENTIONS ON I JUST.

02:01:03.522 --> 02:01:05.591
SIGNIFICANTLY SERIOUSLY DISAGREE

02:01:05.658 --> 02:01:06.559
WITH THE APPROACH AS LAID OUT

02:01:06.626 --> 02:01:09.562
THIS BILL.

02:01:09.629 --> 02:01:11.263
WELL I APPRECIATE THAT -- WITH

02:01:11.330 --> 02:01:14.100
PART OF THIS BILL IS BASED UPON

02:01:14.166 --> 02:01:17.136
THE TWENTY FIFTEEN LA -- TWENTY

02:01:17.203 --> 02:01:18.537
SIXTEEN LA -- SET OF

02:01:18.604 --> 02:01:20.539

EXCUSE ME THE AUDITOR'S

02:01:21.707 --> 02:01:23.509
RECOMMENDATIONS SO.

02:01:23.576 --> 02:01:25.711
I KNOW THE WHEELS OF POLICY

02:01:25.778 --> 02:01:27.179
MOVES SLOWLY.

02:01:27.246 --> 02:01:30.282
OUR BLOOD WE REALLY ARE AT THE

02:01:30.349 --> 02:01:32.284
POINT WHERE WE HAVE TAKEN THAT

02:01:32.351 --> 02:01:34.253
REPORTS SERIOUSLY AND I SERVED

02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:36.255
ON J. LIKE FOR SIX YEARS IN THE

02:01:36.322 --> 02:01:38.290
ASSEMBLY SO I I APPRECIATE THE

02:01:38.357 --> 02:01:39.291
WORK IT DOES.

02:01:39.358 --> 02:01:41.260
AT WE TAKE THIS VERY SERIOUSLY

02:01:41.327 --> 02:01:44.530
AND WHAT WE'VE CALLED UPON IS

02:01:44.597 --> 02:01:46.098
THE EXPERTISE.

02:01:46.165 --> 02:01:47.967
OF NOT ONLY THE UNIVERSITY

02:01:48.034 --> 02:01:49.702
CALIFORNIA BUT ALL OF THE

02:01:49.769 --> 02:01:51.437
VARIOUS AGENCIES THAT WILL THEN

02:01:51.504 --> 02:01:54.106
BE TAKING IN TRYING TO ANALYZE.

02:01:54.173 --> 02:01:56.776
THAT INFORMATION AND SO I THINK

02:01:56.842 --> 02:02:00.379
THAT THAT BECOMES -- THE FOCUS

02:02:00.446 --> 02:02:02.481
AND YOU KNOW.

02:02:02.548 --> 02:02:05.551

02:02:06.852 --> 02:02:08.888
THAT SENSE OF KIND OF CYNICISM

02:02:08.954 --> 02:02:09.855
HOW HER SYSTEM WHEN I MEAN IT'S

02:02:09.922 --> 02:02:12.458
NOT PERFECT BY ANY MEANS BUT I

02:02:12.525 --> 02:02:14.293
DO THINK THAT -- WE AIR THIS IN

02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:17.296
PUBLIC WE MAKE EVALUATIONS

02:02:17.363 --> 02:02:18.497
EVERYBODY MAKES THEIR BEST CASE.

02:02:18.564 --> 02:02:21.067
ARE AND THEN WE DECIDE AS A BODY.

02:02:21.133 --> 02:02:22.802
WHAT TAX BREAKS WERE GONNA GIVE

02:02:22.868 --> 02:02:24.804
WE DECIDE WHETHER WE WANT THAT

02:02:24.870 --> 02:02:26.105
MONEY TO INSTEAD TO GO INTO

02:02:26.172 --> 02:02:28.774

AND WE IS A BODY GET TO DECIDE

02:02:35.715 --> 02:02:38.184
WHETHER AS A POLICY THAT'S A

02:02:38.250 --> 02:02:40.019
GOOD THING OR BAD THING SO SO I

02:02:40.086 --> 02:02:42.021
LOOK AT THIS -- AS A LITTLE MORE

02:02:42.088 --> 02:02:44.523
OF A PROACTIVE PROCESS BUT I

02:02:44.590 --> 02:02:46.525
