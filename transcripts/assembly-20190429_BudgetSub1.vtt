WE FEEL THE PROJECT HAS A HIGH

00:47:27.177 --> 00:47:28.845
RATE OF SUCCESS BECAUSE WE HAVE

THAT LEAD TO LOWERING THE RISK

00:47:46.797 --> 00:47:48.765
OF FAILURE INCREASING THAT THE

00:47:48.832 --> 00:47:51.735
RISK FOR SUCCESS.

DO RAISE SOME CONCERNS JUST

00:49:34.271 --> 00:49:35.372
ABOUT HOW THIS AFFECTS THE

ALTHOUGH WE DEFINITELY KNOWLEDGE

00:50:26.523 --> 00:50:29.092
LA THOSE CONCERNS -- THERE HAVE

00:50:29.159 --> 00:50:30.127
BEEN RECENT.

00:50:30.193 --> 00:50:32.462
SYSTEMS THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED

00:50:32.529 --> 00:50:34.431
BY PUBLIC HEALTH AND FOR EXAMPLE

00:50:34.498 --> 00:50:36.133
THE CANNABIS LICENSING SYSTEM SO

00:50:36.199 --> 00:50:37.267
THEY HAVE THE CENTER OF

00:50:37.334 --> 00:50:38.568
EXCELLENCE AROUND THAT.

00:50:38.635 --> 00:50:40.303

THE PROJECT I MEAN WE HAVE SPENT

00:51:53.043 --> 00:51:54.611
OVER TWO YEARS PLANNING WE HAVE

00:51:54.678 --> 00:51:55.912
FOUR DIFFERENT CONTRACTS MULTI

00:51:55.979 --> 00:51:57.981
YEAR CONTRACT -- WE ALSO KNOW

00:51:58.048 --> 00:51:59.749
THAT AT THE END OF THE POWER

00:51:59.816 --> 00:52:01.885
PROCESS WHICH IS -- FINAL

00:52:01.952 --> 00:52:02.385
APPROVAL BY THE PARTNER

00:52:02.452 --> 00:52:04.588
TECHNOLOGY THERE ARE TWO ONGOING

00:52:04.654 --> 00:52:06.323
OVERSIGHT REPORTAGE THAT OUR

00:52:06.389 --> 00:52:08.291
PUBLIC AND THAT CONTINUALLY

00:52:08.358 --> 00:52:09.793
MONTH AFTER MONTH MONITOR THE

00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:11.294
SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF THE

00:52:11.361 --> 00:52:12.362
PROJECT.

00:52:12.429 --> 00:52:13.663
SO HAVING TO COME BACK EVERY

00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:15.065
YEAR POTENTIALLY WITH ANOTHER

00:52:15.131 --> 00:52:17.334
VCP WOULD MEAN WE WOULD HAVE TO

00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:18.835
WRITE A B. C. P. TODAY FOR NEXT

00:52:18.902 --> 00:52:20.904
YEAR TO ENSURE WE HAVE NO LAPSE.

00:52:20.971 --> 00:52:23.507
AND IN SOME CASES A DEPENDING ON

00:52:23.573 --> 00:52:24.975
THE CONTRACT COULD BE RIGHT A

00:52:25.041 --> 00:52:27.077
MULTI YEAR CONTRACT WITHOUT

00:52:27.143 --> 00:52:27.978
HAPPENED WHEN NOT HAVING

00:52:28.044 --> 00:52:29.846
GUARANTEED FUNDING IT INTRODUCES

00:52:29.913 --> 00:52:31.781
A FEW ISSUES OF THE FLOW OF THE

00:52:31.848 --> 00:52:32.782
PROJECT.

00:52:32.849 --> 00:52:34.451
THE LAST THING WE'D EVER WANT IS

00:52:34.518 --> 00:52:35.719
NOT TO BE ABLE HIGHER OUR STAFF

00:52:35.785 --> 00:52:38.121
FULL TIME RATHER THAN LIMIT TO

00:52:38.188 --> 00:52:39.322
TERM WHO'D WANT TO BREAK IN A

00:52:39.389 --> 00:52:40.757
CONTRACT WHERE WE WOULD HAVE TO

00:52:40.824 --> 00:52:42.926
POTENTIALLY GO OUT TO BID AGAIN

00:52:42.993 --> 00:52:44.928
AND HIGHER DIFFERENT VENDOR. TO

00:52:44.995 --> 00:52:46.229
WORK THOSE THINGS COULD CAUSE

00:52:46.296 --> 00:52:48.665
THE DESTRUCTION THAT WERE WERE A

00:52:48.732 --> 00:52:50.800
TOTAL OF A AGREEMENT ALIGNMENT

00:52:50.867 --> 00:52:52.035
WITH TRANSPARENCY.

00:52:52.102 --> 00:52:55.005
A WHATEVER -- IT TAKES TO ENSURE

00:52:55.071 --> 00:52:56.406
THAT EVERYBODY IS IT THAT WE'RE

00:52:56.473 --> 00:52:58.942
TRANSPARENT AND WE MAKE THE

00:52:59.009 --> 00:52:59.809
RIGHT DECISIONS.

00:52:59.876 --> 00:53:00.977
BUT KNOWING HOW HEALTH PRIOR

00:53:01.044 --> 00:53:02.312
PROJECTS GO THERE IS A

00:53:02.379 --> 00:53:03.413
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF OVERSIGHT

00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:04.781
BY THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY

00:53:04.848 --> 00:53:06.716
AND EVEN FINANCE ON A REGULAR

00:53:06.783 --> 00:53:09.185
BASIS ON THE SUCCESS OF THE

00:53:09.252 --> 00:53:11.588
DEVELOPMENT EFFORT OF A PROJECT.

00:53:11.655 --> 00:53:13.890
SO PALM I'M I I'D NOT SURE THAT

00:53:13.957 --> 00:53:15.392
BRING IT BACK THE LEGISLATURE

00:53:15.458 --> 00:53:17.627
EVERY YEAR IS SOMETHING THAT HAS

00:53:17.694 --> 00:53:20.230
TO BE DONE IS A LOT OF EFFORT

00:53:20.297 --> 00:53:22.699
AND WORK TO PUT A BGP THROUGH

00:53:22.766 --> 00:53:24.801
OUR OUR COME BACK AROUND TO MAKE

00:53:24.868 --> 00:53:25.435
SURE THAT IT'S THAT IT'S PICKED

00:53:25.502 --> 00:53:26.002
A FULL.

00:53:26.069 --> 00:53:28.104
AND WE HAVE A PRETTY GOOD TRACK

00:53:28.171 --> 00:53:28.705
RECORD AND WE'RE BUILDING ON

00:53:28.772 --> 00:53:29.773
KNOWN.

00:53:29.839 --> 00:53:31.241
PLATFORMS -- IF THIS WAS

00:53:31.308 --> 00:53:32.509
SOMETHING BRAND NEW I WOULD

00:53:32.576 --> 00:53:33.944
COULD BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT BUT

00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:35.378
THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT WE'VE

00:53:35.445 --> 00:53:41.051
INVEST A LOT OF TIME TO ENSURE

00:53:41.117 --> 00:53:43.119
ITS SUCCESS.

00:53:43.186 --> 00:53:45.655
IT IT AS WAS NOTED IN THE HELP

00:53:45.722 --> 00:53:47.624
PROCESS THE LAST. TWO STAGES

00:53:47.691 --> 00:53:48.325
HAVE NOT BEEN COMPLETED.

00:53:48.391 --> 00:53:48.925
I MEAN THE WHOLE PURPOSES FOR

00:53:48.992 --> 00:53:51.461
MORE TRANSPARENCY -- AND I

00:53:51.528 --> 00:53:54.164
APPRECIATE I APPRECIATE ALEJO.

00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:56.032
EXPRESSING THE CONCERNS IT IS

00:53:56.099 --> 00:53:57.667
SOMETHING THAT I THINK NEEDS TO

00:53:57.734 --> 00:54:00.503
BE LOOKED AT THE LEAD.

00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:03.273
TESTING IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT

00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:03.607
FOR CHILDREN.

00:54:03.673 --> 00:54:05.275
I THINK THEY HAVE TO BE TESTED

00:54:05.342 --> 00:54:06.543
TWICE AND THE COMMUNICATION

00:54:06.610 --> 00:54:08.578
BETWEEN I CAN'T REMEMBER THE

00:54:08.645 --> 00:54:13.683
OTHER DEPARTMENT THE NEEDS -- TO

YOU -- IF THE COMMUNICATION

00:54:17.754 --> 00:54:19.990

HEARING ON THIS.

00:54:24.894 --> 00:54:26.696
AND TO SEE THAT MANY OF OUR

00:54:26.763 --> 00:54:29.165
CHILDREN ARE FALLING.

00:54:29.232 --> 00:54:30.500
BETWEEN THE CRACKS AND IT'S A

00:54:30.567 --> 00:54:34.004
SERIOUS PROBLEM -- BECAUSE THE

00:54:34.070 --> 00:54:35.605
RESULTS ARE DEVASTATING I KNOW

00:54:35.672 --> 00:54:37.107
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN I. T.

00:54:37.173 --> 00:54:38.174

WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT THE

00:54:39.709 --> 00:54:41.044
CHILDREN AND IF WE DON'T DO THAT

00:54:41.111 --> 00:54:43.213
LET TESTING ON THE CHILDREN WE

00:54:43.279 --> 00:54:44.948
HAVE SOME MORE CAKE.

00:54:45.015 --> 00:54:46.950
PROCESS OF KEEPING TRACK.

00:54:47.017 --> 00:54:49.853

01:11:15.471 --> 01:11:17.373
YOU HAVE SOME COUNTIES ARE SOME

01:11:17.439 --> 01:11:18.440
ORGANIZATIONS.

01:11:18.507 --> 01:11:20.042
THAT ARE BETTER AT WRITING

01:11:20.109 --> 01:11:21.844
PROPOSALS KLAY AND IF YOU'RE

01:11:21.910 --> 01:11:23.912
GOING TO DETERMINE THE NEEDS OF

01:11:23.979 --> 01:11:25.547
A COMMUNITY.

01:11:25.614 --> 01:11:28.517
AND YOU ASK THE THE COMMUNITY

01:11:28.584 --> 01:11:30.185
WHAT ARE YOUR NEEDS IF THEY

01:11:30.252 --> 01:11:31.854
DON'T KNOW WHAT IT EVERYBODY

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:33.622
ELSE IS LOOKING AT THEY WON'T

01:11:33.689 --> 01:11:35.524
REALLY KNOW WHAT THEY SHOULD BE

01:11:35.591 --> 01:11:36.025
SAYING.

01:11:36.091 --> 01:11:37.526

LOOKING -- FOR IT WOULD SEEM TO

01:11:42.164 --> 01:11:43.565
ME THAT THE COUNTIES ARE THE

01:11:43.632 --> 01:11:45.534
CITIES OR THE COMMUNITIES ARE

01:11:45.601 --> 01:11:47.770
BEING LEFT OUT WOULD RECOGNIZE

01:11:47.836 --> 01:11:49.271
THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THEY CAN

01:11:49.338 --> 01:11:50.739
ASK.

01:11:50.806 --> 01:11:52.274
OF THAT THEY CAN ASK FOR AND IF

01:11:52.341 --> 01:11:53.509
THEY DON'T KNOW THAT THAT IS

01:11:53.575 --> 01:11:55.611
SOMETHING THAT IS BEING ASSESSED.

01:11:55.678 --> 01:11:57.279
THEN THEY WON'T KNOW TO TELL YOU

01:11:57.346 --> 01:11:58.447
ABOUT IT.

01:11:58.514 --> 01:12:01.784
BUT THAT ALWAYS IS A A MAJOR

01:12:01.850 --> 01:12:02.584
CONCERN.

DOES THE THE DATA TAKEN TO

01:14:08.777 --> 01:14:09.511
COLLECTION URBAN SUBURBAN -- AS

01:14:09.578 --> 01:14:10.879
FAR AS THOSE COUNTIES IN THE

01:14:10.946 --> 01:14:11.647
SEPARATION OF THOSE -- AREAS

01:14:11.713 --> 01:14:13.148
WHERE THEY'RE AT IT WELL AND IT

01:14:13.215 --> 01:14:16.018

BUT STILL THE NEED IS THERE.

01:14:25.527 --> 01:14:27.830
SO IF ALL THAT DATA IS COMING IN

01:14:27.896 --> 01:14:29.231
HOW THEN I MEAN YOU'RE DEALING

01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:30.866
WITH FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES HOW

01:14:30.933 --> 01:14:32.367
THEN DO YOU START TO LOOK AT

01:14:32.434 --> 01:14:33.202
WHERE.

01:14:33.268 --> 01:14:35.170
THAT MONEY IS STARTING TO GO OR

01:14:35.237 --> 01:14:36.038
AS FAR AS THOSE THAT ARE GONNA

01:14:36.104 --> 01:14:37.306
BE COMPETING.

01:14:37.372 --> 01:14:39.074
HOW TO THE RIGHT FOR THAT GRANT

01:14:39.141 --> 01:14:39.708
BASED ON THAT CRITERIA THAT'S

01:14:39.775 --> 01:14:41.143
COMING IN AND IS THERE A

01:14:41.210 --> 01:14:43.245
CRITERIA MODEL -- GIVEN TO THE

01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:45.080
COUNTIES AHEAD OF TIME SO THEY

01:14:45.147 --> 01:14:46.982
CAN START TO PLAN AND MAKE SURE

01:14:47.049 --> 01:14:50.085
THEY'RE PERFORMING.

01:14:50.152 --> 01:14:52.354
IN AREAS THAT.

01:14:52.421 --> 01:14:53.722
WILL BE SEEN -- POSSIBLE --

01:14:53.789 --> 01:14:55.657
POSSIBLE TO BE ABLE TO GET THE

01:14:55.724 --> 01:14:57.392
GRANT MOVING FORWARD.

01:14:57.459 --> 01:14:58.894
SO THERE'S THAT THE NF P. AND

01:14:58.961 --> 01:15:01.330
HFA THEY HAVE MODEL CRITERIA

01:15:01.396 --> 01:15:02.731
THAT THAT.

01:15:02.798 --> 01:15:04.366
THAT.

01:15:04.433 --> 01:15:06.201
YOU KNOW WHEN IMPLEMENTED WILL

01:15:06.268 --> 01:15:07.636
WILL IMPROVE OUTCOMES THEIR

01:15:07.703 --> 01:15:09.104
THEIR EVIDENCE BASED MODEL SO

01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:11.273
THERE ARE SPECIFIC CRITERIA FOR

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:12.941
THE TWO MODELS THAT THAT WE

01:15:13.008 --> 01:15:14.009
IMPLEMENT.

01:15:14.076 --> 01:15:17.112
SO WE WANT TO LOOK AT WHAT ARE

01:15:17.179 --> 01:15:19.548
THE NEEDS OF THE POPULATION IN

01:15:19.615 --> 01:15:22.851
ORDER TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE.

01:15:22.918 --> 01:15:24.152
WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF

01:15:24.219 --> 01:15:26.288
IMPLEMENTING OTHER MODELS THAT

01:15:26.355 --> 01:15:27.689
HAVE DIFFERENT CRITERIA?

01:15:27.756 --> 01:15:29.791
AND SO THAT THAT'S WHAT WE ARE

01:15:29.858 --> 01:15:31.660
GOING TO BE EMBARKING ON IN YOUR

01:15:31.727 --> 01:15:33.028
ONE SO WHEN YOU'RE.

01:15:33.095 --> 01:15:34.496
THREE WERE IMPLEMENTING A

01:15:34.563 --> 01:15:36.632
DIFFERENT MODEL WITH A DIFFERENT

01:15:36.698 --> 01:15:38.800
SET OF CRITERIA TO MEET AN AND

01:15:38.867 --> 01:15:42.704
MATT NEED IN THE COMMUNITY. TO

01:15:42.771 --> 01:15:43.338
MAKE SENSE.

01:15:43.405 --> 01:15:44.673
YEAH BUT IS A SEPARATE IT

01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:47.242
TOWARDS URBAN SUBURBAN ARE --

01:15:47.309 --> 01:15:49.111
ROLE AS FAR AS THE DIFFERENT

01:15:49.177 --> 01:15:51.280
COUNTIES AT THAT AND THE DATA IS

01:15:51.346 --> 01:15:52.447
BEING COLLECTED OR HOW THOSE

01:15:52.514 --> 01:15:53.715
GRANTS ARE COMING FORWARD.

01:15:53.782 --> 01:15:56.852
INVEST MODELS USED IN THE THAT

01:15:56.919 --> 01:15:58.887
KERR PARTICULAR SETTING.

01:15:58.954 --> 01:15:59.788
I'M OR IS IT JUST.

01:15:59.855 --> 01:16:00.889
IT'S BROUGHT IT'S BROUGHT IS BY

01:16:00.956 --> 01:16:04.226
COUNTY WE WE THE RESPONSIBILITY

01:16:04.293 --> 01:16:06.862
OF KNOWING THE VET THE NEEDS OF

01:16:06.929 --> 01:16:07.930
THE COUNTY.

01:16:07.996 --> 01:16:10.232
WHETHER IT'S URBAN RURAL OR

01:16:10.299 --> 01:16:13.268
POCKETS WITHIN IT WITH IN A CITY

01:16:13.335 --> 01:16:15.003
IS UP TO THE M. C. H. DIRECTORS

01:16:15.070 --> 01:16:16.505
AND WE LIE ON RELY ON THEM FOR

01:16:16.571 --> 01:16:17.806
THEIR EXPERTISE TO TRULY

01:16:17.873 --> 01:16:19.207
UNDERSTAND.

01:16:19.274 --> 01:16:20.676
HOW BEST TO CARRY FORWARD

01:16:20.742 --> 01:16:23.612
PROGRAMS AND SO USING THE LENS

01:16:23.679 --> 01:16:26.415
OF OUR HOME VISITING MODEL?

01:16:26.481 --> 01:16:28.417
WHAT MODELS THEN BECAUSE MODELS

01:16:28.483 --> 01:16:31.219
HAVE CRITERIA WHAT CRITERIA THEN

01:16:31.286 --> 01:16:33.055
DO WE WANT TO IMPLEMENT IN THE

01:16:33.121 --> 01:16:35.157
COUNTIES TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE

01:16:35.223 --> 01:16:38.493
GOING TO GET THE RESULTS THAT WE

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.963
WANT WITH THIS INVESTMENT?

01:16:41.029 --> 01:16:43.065
THANK YOU. FOR THE TEST IT IS AN

01:16:43.131 --> 01:16:43.799
IN IT AND WE WANT TO SPEND THE

01:16:43.865 --> 01:16:45.067
TIME AND THE VERY THOUGHTFUL IN

01:16:45.133 --> 01:16:47.202
THIS REVIEW SO THAT WE TRULY

01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:48.770
UNDERSTAND WHO'S BEING LEFT

01:16:48.837 --> 01:16:50.272
BEHIND BUT COUNTIES AREN'T BEING

01:16:50.339 --> 01:16:52.341
FUNDED WHAT POPULATIONS ARE NOT

01:16:52.407 --> 01:16:53.275
BEING FUNDED.

01:16:53.342 --> 01:16:54.543
AND THEN DO WE HAVE THE RIGHT

01:16:54.609 --> 01:16:56.345
MODELS IN PLACE THAT HAVE THE

01:16:56.411 --> 01:16:58.447
CRITERION THE FIDELITY TO THE

01:16:58.513 --> 01:17:00.816
MODEL TO CLOSE THE GAPS IN THOSE

01:17:00.882 --> 01:17:02.317
NEEDS.

01:17:02.384 --> 01:17:04.653
VETERAN COLLECTING DATA ON

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:06.989
DEMOGRAPHICS EIGHT ON CLIENTS

01:17:07.055 --> 01:17:08.156
CORRECT CORRECT CURRENT.

01:17:08.223 --> 01:17:09.124
SO AS PART OF THE TWO MODELS

01:17:09.191 --> 01:17:09.958
THAT WE USE THAT MIGHT BE

01:17:10.025 --> 01:17:11.193
DIFFERENT FROM THER MODELS THAT

01:17:11.259 --> 01:17:12.394
ARE BEING USED BY OTHER PROGRAMS

01:17:12.461 --> 01:17:14.262
AS WE COLLECT A LOT OF DATA ON

01:17:14.329 --> 01:17:15.630
OUR CLIENTELE.

01:17:15.697 --> 01:17:16.898
AND WE HAVE A TEAM OF

01:17:16.965 --> 01:17:19.101
EPIDEMIOLOGISTS WHO WHO ARE

01:17:19.167 --> 01:17:20.635
ANALYZING THAT DATA SO.

01:17:20.702 --> 01:17:22.437
WELL THAT WHILE THE PROGRAM

01:17:22.504 --> 01:17:23.638
MIGHT LOOK AT SAN BERNADINO AS A

01:17:23.705 --> 01:17:26.608
WHOLE WERE ABLE TO DRILL DOWN BY

01:17:26.675 --> 01:17:29.011
PROBABLY BY ZIP CODE TO LOOK AT

01:17:29.077 --> 01:17:30.645
DIFFERENT COME AND KNOW THAT.

01:17:30.712 --> 01:17:33.248
THIS GROUP OF WOMEN HERE.

01:17:33.315 --> 01:17:36.051
IN THIS AREA ARE MORE RURAL THAN

01:17:36.118 --> 01:17:37.853
THE GROUP OF WOMEN OVER HERE IN

01:17:37.919 --> 01:17:39.921
A MORE URBAN ZIP CODE SO WE DO

01:17:39.988 --> 01:17:41.423
DEFINITELY ARE COLLECTING DATA

01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:43.291
AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO DRILL

01:17:43.358 --> 01:17:44.926

ON THE GROUND THAT WOULD HAVE

01:20:03.965 --> 01:20:08.470
INTEL ON THE POPULATION.

01:20:08.537 --> 01:20:10.672
I THINK THAT THE THE BIGGEST

01:20:10.739 --> 01:20:11.973
CONCERN.

01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:13.842

GOING TO TAKE TO IMPLEMENT.

01:20:18.313 --> 01:20:20.215
AND I THINK GOING BACK TO THE

01:20:20.282 --> 01:20:23.018
COMMENTS THE STAFF COMMENTS.

01:20:23.084 --> 01:20:24.219
ON PAGE.

01:20:24.286 --> 01:20:25.287
TWENTY ABOUT WHETHER THESE

ACTIVITIES COULD OVERLAP.

01:20:28.723 --> 01:20:30.559
EACH OTHER IN YEAR.

01:20:30.625 --> 01:20:31.993

THEY COULD.

01:20:34.829 --> 01:20:36.698
WELL WE'RE WORKLOAD THE WORKLOAD

01:20:36.765 --> 01:20:38.500
OVERLAPS BUT THE IMPLEMENTATION

01:20:38.567 --> 01:20:40.702
DOES NOT SO IN THE FIRST YEAR

01:20:40.769 --> 01:20:41.937
DEFINITELY WE WILL HAVE MORE

01:20:42.003 --> 01:20:45.307
MONEY OUT TO OUR EXISTING --

01:20:45.373 --> 01:20:47.209
ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THAT'S

01:20:47.275 --> 01:20:47.976
SIMPLE TO GET MORE.

01:20:48.043 --> 01:20:50.345
GET AGREEMENTS AMENDED AND GET

01:20:50.412 --> 01:20:51.546
MONEY OUT THE DOOR.

01:20:51.613 --> 01:20:52.781
IT'S GOING TO TAKE US LONGER TO

01:20:52.847 --> 01:20:56.384
LOOK AT WHERE THE GAPS ARE.

01:20:56.451 --> 01:20:58.320
AND ANALYZE WHAT WE NEED IN

01:20:58.386 --> 01:21:00.488
ORDER TO THEN FIGURE OUT HOW TO

01:21:00.555 --> 01:21:03.191
HOW TO CHOOSE.

01:21:03.258 --> 01:21:04.726
DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS.

01:21:04.793 --> 01:21:07.062
AND MOVE THAT MONEY OUT.

01:21:07.128 --> 01:21:08.964
SO THAT'S THE IT IT CERTAINLY

01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:10.465
THE WORK WILL BE HAPPENING IN

01:21:10.532 --> 01:21:12.934

01:39:17.985 --> 01:39:20.087

AGENCY [inaudible]

01:39:26.060 --> 01:39:28.495
BUT YET.

01:39:28.562 --> 01:39:30.864
WHAT WE'RE GETTING BACK?

01:39:30.931 --> 01:39:32.433
IS THE SAME HEADACHE WE'VE BEEN

01:39:32.499 --> 01:39:35.436
GETTING BACK AND IN ITS THINGS

01:39:35.502 --> 01:39:37.438
ARE SLOW TO COME BACK.

01:39:37.504 --> 01:39:38.806
IN IN YOU GUYS ARE GREAT WORKING

01:39:38.872 --> 01:39:41.008
WITH MY OFFICE I KNOW THAT I

01:39:41.075 --> 01:39:43.911
APPRECIATE THAT BUT WE HAVE AN

01:39:43.977 --> 01:39:44.945
ENTIRE SAY WE'VE GOT TO TAKE

01:39:45.012 --> 01:39:46.880
CARE OF WE HAVE MILLIONS UPON

01:39:46.947 --> 01:39:48.549
MILLIONS OF FAMILIES THAT NEED

01:39:48.615 --> 01:39:49.983
HELP.

01:39:50.050 --> 01:39:52.986
AND WE'VE GOT A SEE BETTER

01:39:53.053 --> 01:39:54.788
RETURN ON INVESTMENT.

01:39:54.855 --> 01:39:56.357
AND AND THAT'S MY BIGGEST.

01:39:56.423 --> 01:39:58.092
CONCERN ON ALL OF THIS BECAUSE

01:39:58.158 --> 01:40:00.060
IT'S BECAUSE THE RETURN ON

01:40:00.127 --> 01:40:01.395
INVESTMENT WE'RE GETTING ON THE

01:40:01.462 --> 01:40:02.429
OTHER END [inaudible]

01:40:02.496 --> 01:40:04.031
IS [inaudible]

01:40:04.098 --> 01:40:06.734
IT'S HURTING.

01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:07.801
AND WE'RE NOT GETTING.

01:40:07.868 --> 01:40:09.303
THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT ON THE

01:40:09.370 --> 01:40:10.904
SIDE FROM THE STATE AGENCY FROM

01:40:10.971 --> 01:40:13.273
YOU FOLKS SO HOW HOW IS THAT

01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:15.209
GOING TO BALANCE OUT AND WHY

01:40:15.275 --> 01:40:16.810
SHOULD WE GIVE THAT TO YOU.

01:40:16.877 --> 01:40:18.078
I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND YOUR

01:40:18.145 --> 01:40:19.847
CONCERNS ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE

01:40:19.913 --> 01:40:21.014
PAST HISTORY.

01:40:21.081 --> 01:40:22.649
AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

01:40:22.716 --> 01:40:24.284
PART OF THESE FEE INCREASES ARE

01:40:24.351 --> 01:40:25.652
TO RIGHT SIZE THE SHIP IN THE

01:40:25.719 --> 01:40:27.421
SENSE THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL

01:40:27.488 --> 01:40:28.389
YEARS WERE.

01:40:28.455 --> 01:40:30.624
FEES WERE EITHER DECREASED OR

01:40:30.691 --> 01:40:31.291
STABILIZE WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE

01:40:31.358 --> 01:40:33.527
BEEN GROWING WHICH THEN.

01:40:33.594 --> 01:40:35.596
THEREFORE THEN WE'RE TRYING TO

01:40:35.662 --> 01:40:37.097
RIGHT SIZE EIGHT YEARS LATER

01:40:37.164 --> 01:40:38.999
WHICH CAUSES THESE THESE HUGE

01:40:39.066 --> 01:40:40.134
INCREASES.

01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:41.668

TROUGHOUT THE STATE IT TAKES

01:40:51.578 --> 01:40:52.980
TIME TO HAVE THAT KIND OF

01:40:53.046 --> 01:40:53.714

RESULTS FROM THE AGENCY

01:41:58.345 --> 01:42:00.280

UNDERSTAND THERE'S GOING TO BE A

01:43:51.425 --> 01:43:52.626
FEE INCREASE.

01:43:52.693 --> 01:43:54.227
CONCERNS REFLECT THE STEADY

01:43:54.294 --> 01:43:55.729
INCREASES OVER THE PAST MANY

01:43:55.796 --> 01:43:57.030
YEARS COUPLED WITH ALLEGE THAT

01:43:57.097 --> 01:43:59.099
LACK OF PROGRESS ON PROVIDING

01:43:59.166 --> 01:44:00.701
MORE TIMELY SERVICE.

01:44:17.250 --> 01:44:19.886
