00:54:27.163 --> 00:54:28.465
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY NEARLY

00:54:28.531 --> 00:54:30.000
THREE OUT OF FOUR YEARS IN THE

00:54:30.066 --> 00:54:31.401
STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN

00:54:31.468 --> 00:54:33.670
DROUGHT YEARS. NOW AS I REFLECT

00:54:33.737 --> 00:54:35.772
ON. OUR SERVICE AREA ITSELF.

00:54:35.839 --> 00:54:38.742
BACK IN TWENTY TWELVE THERE WAS

00:54:38.808 --> 00:54:39.709
AN ASSESSMENT THAT WAS DONE TO

00:54:39.776 --> 00:54:42.178
IDENTIFY. HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS.

00:54:42.245 --> 00:54:44.381
FOR SERBIA AND WE HAVE. LESS

00:54:44.447 --> 00:54:46.683
THAN 15% THAT DOESN'T. I FOR

00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:48.051
RISKIER WOULD THROUGH THE

00:55:05.001 --> 00:55:06.269
. NOT ONLY HAVE A WORSE IMPACT

00:55:06.336 --> 00:55:07.837
ON THE MARTEL OF TREE BUT THEY-

00:55:07.904 --> 00:55:09.139
YET THE FUEL FOR THE

00:55:09.205 --> 00:55:10.740
CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE SPREAD-

00:55:10.807 --> 00:55:12.876
AND THE IMPACT OF ALL FAR AS WE

00:55:12.942 --> 00:55:14.244
ALL KNOW- BECAUSE WE FACED THEM

00:55:14.310 --> 00:55:15.945
OURSELVES OUR FRIENDS FAMILIES

00:55:16.012 --> 00:55:17.414
NEIGHBORS. HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS

00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:20.150
FIRST HAND DEVASTATION THAT

00:55:20.216 --> 00:55:22.686
COMES WITH NOT JUST AN IMMEDIATE

00:55:22.752 --> 00:55:23.353
THREAT TO HUMAN LIFE AND

00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:25.188
PROPERTY. NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE

00:55:25.255 --> 00:55:26.289
VALUE OF LIFE THE NATIONAL

00:55:26.356 --> 00:55:28.291
RESOURCE FOR THE LOCAL ECONOMIES

00:55:28.358 --> 00:55:30.026
ACROSS THE STATE. WERE

00:55:30.093 --> 00:55:31.795
RESPONDING TO THIS CHALLENGE AND

00:55:31.861 --> 00:55:33.329
MAKING EVERY EFFORT TO MITIGATE

00:55:33.396 --> 00:55:34.764
RISK WITH THE MULTI FACETED

00:55:34.831 --> 00:55:37.367
WILDFIRE SAFETY PROGRAM AND ONE

00:55:37.434 --> 00:55:37.834
COMPONENT OF THAT IS

00:55:37.901 --> 00:55:39.803
UNDERGROUNDING. AND LAST YEAR WE

00:55:39.869 --> 00:55:41.438
HAD ANNOUNCED A MULTI YEAR

00:55:41.504 --> 00:55:43.306
PROGRAM UNDERGROUND TEN THOUSAND

00:55:43.373 --> 00:55:45.608
MILES OVER HIGHEST RECLINES IN

00:55:45.675 --> 00:55:47.944
HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS IN THE TEN

00:55:48.011 --> 00:55:48.912
THOUSAND IS OUT OF THE TWENTY

00:55:48.978 --> 00:55:50.113
FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED.

00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:51.781
VERSUS SERVICE AREA AND WHAT THE

00:55:51.848 --> 00:55:52.949
STANDS THAT WE'VE TAKEN AS A

00:55:53.016 --> 00:55:54.117
CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE SHE'LL

00:55:54.184 --> 00:55:56.419
STOP AND WE WILL NOT REST. UNTIL

00:55:56.486 --> 00:55:58.488
THAT BECOMES A REALITY OUR NEW

00:55:58.555 --> 00:55:59.556
UNDERGROUNDING FOCUS AND

00:55:59.622 --> 00:56:00.690
REPRESENTS THE LARGEST SUCH

00:56:00.757 --> 00:56:02.759
EFFORT IN THE UNITED STATES TO

00:56:02.826 --> 00:56:03.893
UNDERGROUND POWER LINES OF THE

WILDFIRE RISK REDUCTION MEASURE.

00:56:06.429 --> 00:56:07.831
WE BELIEVE THAT UNDERGROUNDING

00:56:07.897 --> 00:56:09.299
DISTRIBUTION POWER LINES IS THE

00:56:09.365 --> 00:56:10.467
BEST LONG TERM SOLUTION FOR

WE GET THE GREATEST OF THE RISK

00:56:15.972 --> 00:56:18.308
REDUCTION NEARLY 99% OR MORE OR

00:56:18.374 --> 00:56:19.309
FROM CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES THAT

00:56:19.375 --> 00:56:21.377
COULD BE STARTED FROM YOU THE

00:56:21.444 --> 00:56:23.046
EQUIPMENT. BUT WE ALSO GET

00:56:23.113 --> 00:56:24.814
ADDITIONAL BENEFITS IN TERMS OF

00:56:24.881 --> 00:56:26.116
IMPROVING CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE

00:56:26.182 --> 00:56:28.051
AND REDUCING THE SAFETY RISK

00:56:28.118 --> 00:56:29.786
WHEN WE DO HAVE TO DE ENERGIZE

00:56:29.853 --> 00:56:30.653
THE RESULT PUBLIC SAFETY

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:34.157
PROPORTIONAL PROBE I'M- FOR THE

WEATHER CONDITIONS AS WELL. AND

00:57:05.455 --> 00:57:06.689
THE LAST PIECE OF TOUCH ON IN

00:57:06.756 --> 00:57:08.658
TERMS OF BENEFIT IS THAT WE ALSO

00:57:08.725 --> 00:57:09.726

REDUCE COSTS ON AN ONGOING BASIS

00:57:13.062 --> 00:57:14.297
BECAUSE UNDERGROUND THE ONE TIME

SCALE THAT WOULD BRING DOWN

00:57:38.788 --> 00:57:40.557
COSTS OVER THE LONG TERM. WE'VE

00:57:40.623 --> 00:57:42.025
HAD TREMENDOUS EXAMPLES FROM

01:02:09.759 --> 01:02:11.360
BECAUSE OF THE CONCERNS RAISED

01:02:11.427 --> 01:02:16.732
BY THE FARM BUREAU- I REPRESENT

01:02:16.799 --> 01:02:18.935
A VERY LARGE. AREA OF

01:02:19.001 --> 01:02:20.903
AGRICULTURE AND THEY BELIEVE

01:02:20.970 --> 01:02:24.640
THAT THEY ARE IN THE CROSSHAIRS

01:02:24.707 --> 01:02:26.676
. OF THESE KIND OF RATE

01:02:26.742 --> 01:02:28.211
INCREASES AND THEY ARE CONCERNED

01:02:28.277 --> 01:02:30.379

UNTIL FARM BUREAU MAKES A

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:41.657
DECISION THAT MAKES IT VERY

01:02:41.724 --> 01:02:47.497
CLEAR I HAVE BEEN- TOLD OF THAT-

01:02:47.563 --> 01:02:50.566
THIS IS- THE FARM BUREAU IN IT

01:02:50.633 --> 01:02:53.870

AMENDMENTS I HAVEN'T SEEN THEM-

01:03:02.278 --> 01:03:04.380
I WILL SAY THIS THAT I DO THINK

01:03:04.447 --> 01:03:07.984
THAT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:10.753
THAT IT IS MUCH MORE COST

01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:15.825
EFFICIENT. TO EXPAND PG&amp;E

A ONE TIME EXPENDITURE. WHICH

01:03:30.206 --> 01:03:33.876
ACHIEVES SIGNIFICANT SAFETY AS

01:03:33.943 --> 01:03:36.879
OPPOSED TO THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE

01:03:36.946 --> 01:03:41.551
WHICH IS CUTTING TREES FOREVER.

01:03:41.617 --> 01:03:43.986
BUT UNTIL THE FARM BUREAU IS

01:03:44.053 --> 01:03:47.623
SATISFIED- AND THAT THEIR

01:18:20.462 --> 01:18:22.030
THE CONSIDERATION THAT

01:18:22.097 --> 01:18:23.999
SECURITIZED BONDS MUST REDUCE

01:18:24.066 --> 01:18:26.601
RATES ARE THOSE AMENDMENTS AND

01:18:26.668 --> 01:18:28.737
THEY'VE BEEN ACCEPTED OR THEY'RE

01:18:28.804 --> 01:18:30.338
GOING TO BE ACCEPTED. SO THE

01:18:30.405 --> 01:18:33.175
DEATHS OF OKAY SO THE AMENDED

01:18:33.241 --> 01:18:35.177
VERSION THE BILL. RETAINS THE

01:18:35.243 --> 01:18:35.911
CONSIDERATION ABOUT

01:18:35.977 --> 01:18:38.447
SECURITIZATION REDUCING RATES

01:18:38.513 --> 01:18:40.482
YES OKAY AT THE ENDING THAT'S

01:18:40.549 --> 01:18:41.950
IMPORTANT I APPRECIATE THE

01:18:42.017 --> 01:18:44.820
ANSWER AND- I DID ACCEPT ALL THE

01:18:44.886 --> 01:18:48.523
COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THE QUESTION

01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:52.761
I WANTED TO JOIN MY COLLEAGUE-

01:18:52.828 --> 01:18:54.629
WITH RESPECT TO THOSE AMENDMENTS

01:18:54.696 --> 01:18:55.864
AND MAKING SURE I'M GONNA

01:18:55.931 --> 01:19:01.436
SUPPORT THIS- BEING THERE FRESNO

01:19:01.503 --> 01:19:03.405
FOR EIGHT YEARS WE DID A LOT OF

01:19:03.472 --> 01:19:05.040
SECURITIZATION WHICH I WAS ABLE

01:19:05.107 --> 01:19:09.311
TO- YOU KNOW FINANCE- COSTS AT-

01:19:09.377 --> 01:19:11.113
SIGNIFICANTLY LOW. INTEREST

01:19:11.179 --> 01:19:14.349
RATES BACK BACK IN NINETY SIX

01:19:14.416 --> 01:19:15.150
SEVEN EIGHT TWO THOUSAND POINTS

01:19:15.217 --> 01:19:17.519
OUT SO I. UNDERSTAND THE RISK

01:19:17.586 --> 01:19:19.588
REWARD FACTOR. OF-

01:19:19.654 --> 01:19:22.491
SECURITIZATION I WOULD ALSO

01:19:22.557 --> 01:19:24.493
THOUGH SUGGEST THAT GIVEN THE

01:19:24.559 --> 01:19:26.328
INFLATIONARY SPIRALS THAT WE ARE

01:19:26.394 --> 01:19:29.931
SEEING PRESENTLY. AND GIVEN THE

01:19:29.998 --> 01:19:33.602
CLEAR INDICATION FROM THE FED'S

01:19:33.668 --> 01:19:35.337
THAT INTEREST RATES ARE GOING UP

01:19:35.403 --> 01:19:37.539
. I HAVE A CONCERN THAT CONCERN

01:19:37.606 --> 01:19:39.841
IS IT TAKES THE P. YOU SEE AN

01:19:39.908 --> 01:19:41.676
AWFUL LONG TIME TO GET ANYTHING

01:19:41.743 --> 01:19:44.412
DONE. AND THE LONGER THE P. YOU

01:19:44.479 --> 01:19:46.681
SEE TAKES TO APPROVE THE MORE

01:19:46.748 --> 01:19:48.717
LIKELY THE INTEREST RATES ARE

01:19:48.783 --> 01:19:51.887
GOING UP WHICH CLOSES. THE

01:19:51.953 --> 01:19:54.789
LEVERAGE. IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO

01:19:54.856 --> 01:19:56.758
BASICALLY FREEZE COSTS AT LOW

01:19:56.825 --> 01:19:59.928
INTEREST RATES. BUT I THINK LOW

01:19:59.995 --> 01:20:01.563
INTEREST RATES ARE GONNA BE A

01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:03.698
THING OF THE PAST. PRETTY SOON.

01:20:03.765 --> 01:20:05.333
SO AGAIN I'M GOING TO SUPPORT

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:08.370
THIS. BUT I. HAVE REAL CONCERNS

01:20:08.436 --> 01:20:11.506
THAT THE PC IS SO SLOW. IN

01:20:11.573 --> 01:20:12.440
MAKING THESE KIND OF

01:20:12.507 --> 01:20:15.477
DETERMINATIONS. ARE SO I'M GONNA

01:20:15.544 --> 01:20:19.381
GO FOR IT BUT- I SURE HOPE THAT

01:20:19.447 --> 01:20:22.617
WE DON'T SEE THIS BY THIS- IN

01:20:22.684 --> 01:20:25.654
FRESNO WE SECURITIZED- ARE A

01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:28.323
VERY LARGE UNFUNDED LIABILITY IN

01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:33.595
OUR- BOB. RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS

01:20:33.662 --> 01:20:35.664
AND ALL OF THAT TODAY. BECAUSE

01:20:35.730 --> 01:20:38.433
OF THAT FRESNO HAS ONE OF THE

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:43.805
MOST ROBUST AND- SECURE UP. WAYS

01:20:43.872 --> 01:20:45.240
OF MAKING SURE THAT OUR WORK

01:20:45.307 --> 01:20:47.309
WORK FORCE IT IS DOES GET THE

01:20:47.375 --> 01:20:49.844
BENEFITS AND WE CAN AFFORD THOSE

01:20:49.911 --> 01:20:51.446
BENEFITS. HOWEVER WE WERE

01:20:51.513 --> 01:20:53.748
FORTUNATE BECAUSE WE MADE THE

01:20:53.815 --> 01:20:55.483
SECURITIZATION DECISION. AT A

01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:57.152
TIME WHEN INTEREST RATES WERE

01:20:57.219 --> 01:21:00.188
LIKE AT ONE OR 2% ON. A GENERAL

01:21:00.255 --> 01:21:01.256
OBLIGATION BONDS BACK IN THE

01:21:01.323 --> 01:21:04.092
NINETIES. THE BET WHAT'S REALLY

01:21:04.159 --> 01:21:07.395
IMPORTANT HERE. IS THE PRICE TAG

01:21:07.462 --> 01:21:09.931
OF THE SEARCH SECURITIZATION.

01:21:09.998 --> 01:21:11.132
AND THE SOONER YOU CAN GET IT

01:21:11.199 --> 01:21:13.268
DONE. THE LESS LIKELY YOU'RE

01:21:13.335 --> 01:21:15.203
GOING TO END UP WITH THE

01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:17.672
INTEREST RATES THAT. CLOSE THE

01:21:17.739 --> 01:21:20.175
GAP BETWEEN AFFORDABILITY AND

01:21:20.242 --> 01:21:22.844
AFFORDABILITY- I DO THINK WE

01:21:22.911 --> 01:21:25.947
NEED TO BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT THIS

01:21:26.014 --> 01:21:27.916
AND I THINK WE NEED TO BE VERY

01:21:27.983 --> 01:21:31.553
CLEAR WITH RESPECT TO THE PC OF

01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:32.220
THIS GETS FORWARD IT'S SIGNED BY

01:21:32.287 --> 01:21:35.323
THE GOVERNOR THE PC ACT AND ACT

01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:36.424
QUICKLY. BECAUSE WE'RE IN A

01:21:36.491 --> 01:21:38.126
CIRCUMSTANCE IN WHICH INTEREST

01:21:38.193 --> 01:21:39.961
RATES ARE GOING TO SOAR. AND SO

01:21:40.028 --> 01:21:42.564
NOW IS THE TIME TO DO IT IF

01:21:42.631 --> 01:21:43.932
WE'RE GOING TO DO IT AT ALL. AND

01:21:43.999 --> 01:21:46.735
I DO HAVE A CONCERN THAT. IF SIX

01:21:46.801 --> 01:21:50.438
MONTHS A YEAR. TWO YEARS GO BY

01:21:50.505 --> 01:21:52.173
AND IT TAKES THE P. YOU SEE THAT

01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:54.476
KIND OF TIME TO ACT. WE COULD

01:21:54.542 --> 01:21:56.244
SEE INTEREST RATES THAT MAKE THE

01:21:56.311 --> 01:21:58.780
SECURITIZATION UNAFFORDABLE. AND

01:21:58.847 --> 01:22:00.849
ONE FINAL COMMENT I WE HEAR A

01:22:00.915 --> 01:22:03.118
LOT ABOUT CONCERNS. HERE I'D

01:22:03.184 --> 01:22:04.686
LIKE I'D BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE

01:22:04.753 --> 01:22:05.820
WHAT NINE YEARS GOING ON TEN

01:22:05.887 --> 01:22:08.356
YEARS I HAVE WARNED ABOUT TWO

01:22:08.423 --> 01:22:09.724
THINGS THE GREAT BECOMING

01:22:09.791 --> 01:22:12.227
INCREASINGLY UNRELIABLE AND THE

01:22:12.294 --> 01:22:14.763
COST OF ELECTRICITY SPRING AND

01:22:14.829 --> 01:22:16.264
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAS HAPPENED

01:22:16.331 --> 01:22:18.333
. WE SAY WE CARE ABOUT

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:20.368
RELIABILITY WE SAY WE CARE ABOUT

01:22:20.435 --> 01:22:22.804
RATES AND YET SESSION AFTER

01:22:22.871 --> 01:22:26.374
SESSION. WE CREATE IMPEDIMENTS.

01:22:26.441 --> 01:22:29.377
TO RELIABILITY AND IMPEDIMENTS

01:22:29.444 --> 01:22:33.548
TO AFFORDABILITY. SO I THINK

01:22:33.615 --> 01:22:34.316
THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

01:22:34.382 --> 01:22:36.751
BUT IT BETTER BE ABLE TO TAKE

01:22:36.818 --> 01:22:39.454
ADVANTAGE OF A WINDOW OF

01:22:39.521 --> 01:22:41.189
SOMEWHAT LOW INTEREST RATES.

01:22:41.256 --> 01:22:42.891
BECAUSE PRETTY SOON THOSE

01:22:42.957 --> 01:22:45.694
INTEREST RATES ARE GOING TO SORT

01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:49.698
. THANK YOU- AS FAR CAN FOLLOW

01:22:49.764 --> 01:22:51.599
BY MR MURATSUCHI THANK YOU

MISTER CHAIR I JUST HAD A

01:22:54.369 --> 01:22:55.837
QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR I GUESS

SUPPORTERS IF THEY WANT TO

01:22:56.838 --> 01:22:58.807
ANSWER SO THE I THINK THIS IS AN

01:22:58.873 --> 01:23:00.408
ADDRESS FOR A TWENTY

01:23:00.475 --> 01:23:02.610

01:23:02.677 --> 01:23:04.546
ABILITIES SECURITIZED IN TWENTY

01:23:04.612 --> 01:23:05.380
EIGHTEEN WILDFIRE COST THE

01:23:05.447 --> 01:23:06.915

P. YOU SEE FIND THAT REASONABLE

01:23:09.017 --> 01:23:11.353
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE A SORT OF A

01:23:11.419 --> 01:23:12.721
LOWER STANDARD THAN IS USUAL FOR

01:23:12.787 --> 01:23:13.955
SECURITIZATION WHICH I THINK IS

01:23:14.022 --> 01:23:15.724

USUAL WAY IT'S DRAFTED AGAIN

01:23:25.734 --> 01:23:28.002

CONCERNS. ACCORDING TO THE

01:24:13.982 --> 01:24:16.117

OUR ROOM RATES PAYER RIGHT. DOES

THAT ADDRESS YOUR CONCERN. OUR

01:24:40.809 --> 01:24:43.077
VISION IS THAT THIS IS THE BILL

01:24:43.144 --> 01:24:45.747
THAT'S NOT NEEDED P. THREE

01:24:45.814 --> 01:24:49.417
ALREADY HAVE AUTHORITY TO

01:24:49.484 --> 01:24:53.421
APPROVE SECURITIZATION THAT THIS

01:24:53.488 --> 01:24:57.292
BILL MAKES IT EASIER IT IS

01:24:57.358 --> 01:24:57.959
SENDING A MESSAGE FROM THE

01:24:58.026 --> 01:25:01.729
LEGISLATURE THAT YOU WANT THE P.

01:25:01.796 --> 01:25:02.764
THREE TO APPROVE MORE WE DO

01:25:02.831 --> 01:25:05.700
BELIEVE THAT SECURITIZATION DOES

01:25:05.767 --> 01:25:08.436
HAVE AN APPROPRIATE PLACE I DO

01:25:08.503 --> 01:25:11.739
THINK BREAK A CAR. AND ACTUALLY

01:25:11.806 --> 01:25:14.008
. COSTS IN WHICH THE BENEFIT

01:25:14.075 --> 01:25:16.444
WILL BE EXPERIENCED OVER THE

01:25:16.511 --> 01:25:17.745
SAME AMOUNT OF TIME THAT WE'RE

01:25:17.812 --> 01:25:20.248
SPENDING FOR IT THE IDEA THAT

01:25:20.315 --> 01:25:22.617
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A CAR FOR

01:25:22.684 --> 01:25:23.718
FIFTY YEARS THAT'S WHAT MAKES

01:25:23.785 --> 01:25:32.961
SENSE TO ASK. SIX YEARS. WE

01:25:33.027 --> 01:25:34.195
PARTICULARLY AFTER THE I. OF THE

01:25:34.262 --> 01:25:36.297
EYE OF TAKING IN ANY LOOK A

01:25:36.364 --> 01:25:37.599
OPERATE AND MAINTENANCE COSTS

01:25:37.665 --> 01:25:39.667
WHICH OCCURRED SINGLE AND THEN

01:25:39.734 --> 01:25:41.603
HE THAT OUT OVER FIVE OR TEN

01:25:41.669 --> 01:25:43.671
THAT WE GET INTO TROUBLE WITH

01:25:43.738 --> 01:25:45.206
CREDIT CARDS AND WITH

01:25:45.273 --> 01:25:47.609
SECURITIZATION WHEN YOU TRY TO

01:25:47.675 --> 01:25:49.611
PICTURE IT ANNUAL CONFERENCE

01:25:49.677 --> 01:25:53.781
OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THAT'S WHEN

01:25:53.848 --> 01:25:54.816
YOU START GETTING THE BILL TO.

01:25:54.883 --> 01:25:56.584
BUT MR TONY IF THIS BILL IS

01:25:56.651 --> 01:25:58.887
GOING TO. PROHIBIT THE P. YOU

01:25:58.953 --> 01:26:00.588
SEE FROM A POOR APPROVING ANY

01:26:00.655 --> 01:26:02.891
BONDS TO BE APPROVED THAT WOULD

01:26:02.957 --> 01:26:05.360
RESULT IN A- INCREASE TO RATE

01:26:05.426 --> 01:26:08.029
PAYERS WOULDN'T THAT SATISFY

01:26:08.096 --> 01:26:14.869
YOUR OBJECTIVE. IT IT COULD BE

01:26:14.936 --> 01:26:19.674
FOR A QUESTION OF A INCREASE.

01:26:19.741 --> 01:26:23.044
OVER THERE WILL BE AN INCREASE

01:26:23.111 --> 01:26:28.182
IT A COMPARISON BETWEEN N. FOR

01:26:28.249 --> 01:26:31.252
IT DURING THAT FELT THE SAME

01:26:31.319 --> 01:26:32.754
TWELVE MONTHS AND PAYING FOR IT

01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:35.557
OVER TIME TO TAKE THE CAR

01:26:35.623 --> 01:26:39.827
ANALOGY- OF COURSE IF YOU PAY

01:26:39.894 --> 01:26:42.263
FOR A CAR OVER SHAKESPEARE IT'S

01:26:42.330 --> 01:26:46.134
GONNA LEFT. HER MIND THEN IF YOU

01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:48.202
PAY FOR IT ALL AT ONCE EIGHT FOR

01:26:48.269 --> 01:26:51.673
THE FIRST MONTH OF COURSE BUT

01:26:51.739 --> 01:26:53.741
YOU'RE ALSO GOING TO BE PAYING.

01:26:53.808 --> 01:26:57.011
A GREATER AMOUNT IN TOTAL

01:26:57.078 --> 01:26:58.580
BECAUSE OF THE INTEREST CAR

01:26:58.646 --> 01:27:02.483
BECAUSE OF THE COST OF FINANCING

01:27:02.550 --> 01:27:05.620
THAT'S WHY WE DON'T THINK THAT

01:27:05.687 --> 01:27:07.589
SIMPLY SAYING IT WILL REDUCE

01:27:07.655 --> 01:27:10.091
WEIGHT PAYER COSTS FROM WHAT IT

01:27:10.158 --> 01:27:13.494
WOULD HAVE BEEN IS A HIGH ENOUGH

01:27:13.561 --> 01:27:16.064
THEN. SO THEN I GUESS I WOULD

01:27:16.130 --> 01:27:17.198
HAVE A QUESTION EITHER FOR THE

01:27:17.265 --> 01:27:19.000
AUTHOR OF THE COMMITTEE I MEAN

01:27:19.067 --> 01:27:21.669
DOES THIS BILL- WHICH WILL

01:27:21.736 --> 01:27:27.308
ENSURE YOU KNOW. THAT THAT THE

01:27:27.375 --> 01:27:30.078
COST IMPOSED ON RATEPAYER OVER A

01:27:30.144 --> 01:27:32.447
REPAIRS OVER TIME WHAT WOULD NOT

01:27:32.513 --> 01:27:35.783
BE- INCREASED AS A RESULT OF

01:27:35.850 --> 01:27:37.552
BEING OF THE SECURITIZE.

01:27:37.619 --> 01:27:39.754
OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE

01:27:39.821 --> 01:27:44.892
EXPENSE- HE HAD. YEAH FROM THE I

01:27:44.959 --> 01:27:46.828

01:27:46.894 --> 01:27:49.063
PLAINLY THE AMENDMENT THAT WE

01:27:49.130 --> 01:27:50.131
TOOK FROM THE COMMITTEE

01:27:50.198 --> 01:27:51.332
ADDRESSES EXACTLY WHAT YOU

01:27:51.399 --> 01:27:52.967
SUGGEST THAT IT IT SURE IS THAT

01:27:53.034 --> 01:27:54.836
THIS IS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST

01:27:54.902 --> 01:27:56.204
ALL THE COSTS ARE STILL JUST AND

01:27:56.270 --> 01:27:56.938
REASONABLE THE EXISTING

01:27:57.005 --> 01:27:59.107
FRAMEWORK AND DISCUSSION OF THE

01:27:59.173 --> 01:28:00.475
PC IS ALWAYS THERE TO UNDERSTAND

01:28:00.541 --> 01:28:02.110
WHETHER OR NOT YOU KNOW THE- THE

01:28:02.176 --> 01:28:03.978
SHIP THAT SHORT TERM RATES

01:28:04.045 --> 01:28:06.481
MOVING BENEFITS OF OUR THE

01:28:06.547 --> 01:28:09.684
PROPOSAL HERE. ARE BALANCED IN

01:28:09.751 --> 01:28:12.520
RELATION TO THE LONG TERM TOTAL

01:28:12.587 --> 01:28:14.188
COSTS A TO USE MR ANALOGY OF

01:28:14.255 --> 01:28:15.690
OWNING THE CAR AND ONLY THE

01:28:15.757 --> 01:28:16.958
SITUATIONS WITH THE PUBLIC

01:28:17.025 --> 01:28:18.092
UTILITIES COMMISSION WOULD FIND

01:28:18.159 --> 01:28:21.429
THAT IT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST

01:28:21.496 --> 01:28:22.096
WEARING THE SHORT TERM BENEFITS

01:28:22.163 --> 01:28:22.697
OF MAYBE RATES MOVING IN THE

01:28:22.764 --> 01:28:25.099
NEAR TERM OR LOCKING AND KIND OF

01:28:25.166 --> 01:28:26.300
AS VICE CHAIR SUGGESTED KIND

01:28:26.367 --> 01:28:28.636
COURT COSTS AT A LOW INTEREST

01:28:28.703 --> 01:28:29.637
RATE. IF THAT BALANCED OUT WITH

01:28:29.704 --> 01:28:32.640
THE- THE LONG TERM TOTAL COST

01:28:32.707 --> 01:28:33.875
INCREASES RIGHT OR INTEREST

01:28:33.941 --> 01:28:36.177
COSTS THERE. THE PC HAS IT

01:28:36.244 --> 01:28:36.944
WITHIN ITS DISCRETION TO FIGURE

01:28:37.011 --> 01:28:39.147
OUT THE RIGHT BALANCE AND

01:28:39.213 --> 01:28:39.847
EITHER. OR DENY THAT'S THE CORE

01:28:39.914 --> 01:28:41.616
PIECE HERE I THINK THE EXISTING

01:28:41.683 --> 01:28:42.216
FRAMEWORK ALL STAYS IN PLACE.

01:28:42.283 --> 01:28:43.751
THEY HAVE THE DISCRETION AND

01:28:43.818 --> 01:28:45.086
THAT OF MINUTES WE TOOK FROM

01:28:45.153 --> 01:28:46.754
COMMITTEE OR WHICH I THINK WERE

01:28:46.821 --> 01:28:48.656
VERY WELL RECEIVED ON OUR PART

01:28:48.723 --> 01:28:49.657
WE THINK THIS GOOD.

01:28:49.724 --> 01:28:50.324
CLARIFICATION JUST TO MAKE SURE

01:28:50.391 --> 01:28:51.859
IN THE EYES OF THE COMMITTEES

01:28:51.926 --> 01:28:54.095
VOTING ON THIS TODAY THAT IT IS

01:28:54.162 --> 01:28:55.029
GOING TO REDUCE RATES AS WITH

01:28:55.096 --> 01:28:57.098
THE PC. IS GOING TO BE IN CHARGE

01:28:57.165 --> 01:28:58.933
OF DOING MCCARTY DOES. THANK YOU

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.134
VERY MUCH. YEAH I GET I THINK

01:29:00.201 --> 01:29:02.503
THAT'S A REASONABLE LA. RESPONSE

01:29:02.570 --> 01:29:03.337
TO THAT THE TERM CONCERNS I DO

01:29:03.404 --> 01:29:06.641
WANT TO EXPLORE. THE NATURE OF

01:29:06.708 --> 01:29:07.709
FINANCE INSTRUMENTS THAT WILL BE

01:29:07.775 --> 01:29:11.179
USED. OP WHAT WILL BE THE

01:29:11.245 --> 01:29:15.249
SOURCE. OF THE REPAYMENT. YEAH

01:29:15.316 --> 01:29:17.218
IF IT DOES NOT WAS AYE AYE WHAT

01:29:17.285 --> 01:29:19.554
I WANT TO TRY TO GET TO HERE'S

01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:21.022
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A-

01:29:21.089 --> 01:29:21.789
REVENUE BASE BOND AND A GENERAL

01:29:21.856 --> 01:29:22.657
OBLIGATION BOND AND IN

01:29:22.724 --> 01:29:24.692
GOVERNMENT GENERAL OBLIGATION

01:29:24.759 --> 01:29:29.197
BONDS COME AT. FIRST CALL-

01:29:29.263 --> 01:29:32.366
REVENUE BASE BONDS HAVE A

01:29:32.433 --> 01:29:37.638
SATISFACTORY STREAM OF- PAYMENT-

01:29:37.705 --> 01:29:39.373
AND THOUGH THE RATING

01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:42.877
INSTRUMENTS PROCESS THAT. I

01:29:42.944 --> 01:29:44.846
WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT KIND OF

01:29:44.912 --> 01:29:49.317
A- INSTRUMENT THE UTILITIES WILL

01:29:49.383 --> 01:29:54.255
USE. TO SECURITIZE IS IT BACK BY

01:29:54.322 --> 01:29:57.191
RATES OR IS IT BACK BY THEIR

01:29:57.258 --> 01:30:00.561
GENERAL FUND. I'M HAPPY TO PICK

01:30:00.628 --> 01:30:01.763
UP THE TICKET YES IT'S BACKED BY

01:30:01.829 --> 01:30:03.664
RATES AND THAT'S ONE OF THE CORE

01:30:03.731 --> 01:30:05.867
BENEFITS HERE IS THAT WHEN IT'S

01:30:05.933 --> 01:30:06.801
BACKED BY RATES WE CAN ACTUALLY

01:30:06.868 --> 01:30:08.169
ACCESS THAT CAPITAL THAT THE

01:30:08.236 --> 01:30:10.037
LARGE SUMS THAT WE'RE SEEKING TO

01:30:10.104 --> 01:30:11.472
KIND OF HELP REDUCE RATES THAT

01:30:11.539 --> 01:30:13.040
AND PAY OFF SOME THESE WELFARE.

01:30:13.107 --> 01:30:15.476
EXPENSES AT A LOWER COST THAN IF

01:30:15.543 --> 01:30:16.944
WE WERE TO TRY TO GO OUT THERE

01:30:17.011 --> 01:30:18.780
IN THE CORPORATE BOND MARKET AND

01:30:18.846 --> 01:30:19.914
ACCESS THOSE AND SO THAT SORT OF

01:30:19.981 --> 01:30:21.983
ONE OF THE CORE OPPORTUNITIES

01:30:22.049 --> 01:30:23.050
HERE I THINK YOU HIGHLIGHTED

01:30:23.117 --> 01:30:24.218
INTEREST RATES ARE LOW RIGHT NOW

01:30:24.285 --> 01:30:26.487
BUT WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT

01:30:26.554 --> 01:30:27.622
INTEREST RATES FOR SECURITIZED

01:30:27.688 --> 01:30:28.489
WHEN WE WHEN E SECURITIZE ARE

01:30:28.556 --> 01:30:30.792
ALWAYS LOWER THAN WHAT WE WOULD

01:30:30.858 --> 01:30:33.294
BE ABLE TO SEE USING OUR OWN

01:30:33.361 --> 01:30:35.229
KIND OF BONDING AUTHORITY THAT

01:30:35.296 --> 01:30:37.732
WOULD HAVE AS A CORPORATION.

01:30:37.799 --> 01:30:39.534
BECAUSE OF OUR- FINANCIAL HEALTH

01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:41.135
BASED UPON THE- BROADER WILDFIRE

01:30:41.202 --> 01:30:42.103
DISCUSSIONS WITH CONTINUED

01:30:42.170 --> 01:30:43.538
HAPPENS COMMITTEE FOR A NUMBER

01:30:43.604 --> 01:30:44.839
OF YEARS. SO THAT'S WHERE WE

01:30:44.906 --> 01:30:45.907
VIEW SECURITIZATIONS OPPORTUNITY

01:30:45.973 --> 01:30:47.542
IT'S KIND OF ALWAYS GOING TO BE.

01:30:47.608 --> 01:30:48.843
CHEAPER FOR OUR CUSTOMERS THAN

01:30:48.910 --> 01:30:50.344
JUST GOING ALL STRAIGHT THROUGH

01:30:50.411 --> 01:30:52.146
BONDS AND STUFF. OUR OWN

01:30:52.213 --> 01:30:53.381
CORPORATE DOES THAT. SATISFY

01:30:53.447 --> 01:30:54.782
THE- I'M HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP TO

01:30:54.849 --> 01:30:56.884
BECAUSE I'M JUST BE. WITH US IF

01:30:56.951 --> 01:30:58.853
YOU WANT TO GET INTO THE DETAILS

01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:00.721
ABOUT YOUR EX WILL GET YOU TO

01:31:00.788 --> 01:31:01.889
GO. AGAIN I THOUGHT. ALL OF THIS

01:31:01.956 --> 01:31:03.891
MAKES SENSE IF. THE INTEREST

01:31:03.958 --> 01:31:05.927
RATES PROVIDE A LEVERAGE OF.

01:31:05.993 --> 01:31:08.129
REPRODUCTION IF THE INTEREST

01:31:08.196 --> 01:31:10.965
RATES. SPIKE IT CLOSES THAT

01:31:11.032 --> 01:31:14.202
LEVERAGE. AT AND- AT AND I WILL

01:31:14.268 --> 01:31:16.204
GO BACK TO THE- RISKS THAT WE

01:31:16.270 --> 01:31:18.773
TOOK. IN SECURITIZED IN OUR

01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:20.041
UNFUNDED LIABILITY. AND WE WERE

01:31:20.107 --> 01:31:21.776
VERY FORTUNATE WE HAD GOOD

01:31:21.843 --> 01:31:23.144
ANALYSTS AND WE WENT INTO THAT

01:31:23.211 --> 01:31:24.745
MARKET AT LIKE I DON'T KNOW 2%

01:31:24.812 --> 01:31:25.980
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. WE WERE

01:31:26.047 --> 01:31:28.416
UNDER A COURT ORDER. TO FULFILL

01:31:28.482 --> 01:31:31.419
THE OBLIGATION TO OUR RETIREES.

01:31:31.485 --> 01:31:33.387
SAID SOMETHING LIKE SIX OR SEVEN

01:31:33.454 --> 01:31:34.589
PERCENT. SO OBVIOUSLY WE

01:31:34.655 --> 01:31:37.525
LEVERAGED. AND DOWN. SIZE THE

01:31:37.592 --> 01:31:41.162
COST TODAY. FRESNO HAS- IS

01:31:41.229 --> 01:31:44.465
HIGHLY REGARDED AS ONE OF THE

01:31:44.532 --> 01:31:45.733
FEW CITIES. THAT HAS A FULLY

01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:49.403
FUNDED- RETIREMENT SYSTEM PARTLY

01:31:49.470 --> 01:31:52.573
AS A RESULT OF. BEING FORTUNATE

01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:55.276
BEING BEING A BIT PROPHETIC WITH

01:31:55.343 --> 01:31:57.178
RESPECT WERE PLANNING. BUT ALSO

01:31:57.245 --> 01:31:59.513
SORT OF LOOKING OUT. I AM

01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:02.149
CONCERNED ABOUT THE TIME LAG

01:32:02.216 --> 01:32:03.851
IT'S GOING TO TAKE BETWEEN THE

01:32:03.918 --> 01:32:05.720
TIME WE APPROVE THIS IT GETS

01:32:05.786 --> 01:32:09.257
SIGNED AND IT'S LAW. TO WIN THE

01:32:09.323 --> 01:32:11.826
P. YOU SEE WILL ACT AND I DON'T

01:32:11.893 --> 01:32:13.060
WANT TO BE SITTING HERE SIX

01:32:13.127 --> 01:32:15.029
MONTHS OR A YEAR FROM NOW SEEING

01:32:15.096 --> 01:32:18.432
INTEREST RATES SO HIGH THAT YOU

01:32:18.499 --> 01:32:20.868
CANNOT CLOSE THE GAP. AND THE

01:32:20.935 --> 01:32:23.471
LEVERAGE IS GONE SO THERE'S A

01:32:23.537 --> 01:32:26.140
REAL RISK HERE. AND IT HAS TO DO

01:32:26.207 --> 01:32:28.042
WITH THE INTEREST RATES ON THE

01:32:28.109 --> 01:32:29.610
PRICE TAG OF A BORROWED MONEY

01:32:29.677 --> 01:32:30.745
AND WHO KNOWS WHERE THAT'S GOING

01:32:30.811 --> 01:32:33.514
TO GO. SO I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR

01:32:33.581 --> 01:32:35.416
THIS AND HOPE THAT THE P. YOU

01:32:35.483 --> 01:32:36.017
SEE ACTS QUICKLY AND YOU CAN

01:32:36.083 --> 01:32:37.885
SECURITIZE AT LOW RATES IF NOT

01:32:37.952 --> 01:32:39.854
THIS DOESN'T WORK. WE HAVE TO

01:32:39.921 --> 01:32:42.223
MEMBERS THAT WITH SOCIAL

01:32:42.290 --> 01:32:43.524
QUESTIONS THAT WAS GÓMEZ REYES

01:32:43.591 --> 01:32:44.158
FOLLOWED BY MISS GARCIA. THANK

01:32:44.225 --> 01:32:50.431
YOU. I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS- FEW

01:32:50.498 --> 01:32:52.733
CONCERNS I WILL BE SUPPORTING

01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:55.036
THE BILL TODAY BUT I DO HAVE

01:32:55.102 --> 01:32:58.005
SOME CONCERNS- AS YOU MAY KNOW I

01:32:58.072 --> 01:32:59.941
SAID ON THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE

01:33:00.007 --> 01:33:03.644
FOR WILDFIRES ALSO WORKED-

01:33:03.711 --> 01:33:06.414
DILIGENTLY ON SB NINE OH ONE.

01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:08.916
WITH ROBUST DISCUSSION WITH ALL

01:33:08.983 --> 01:33:13.688
OF THE I. O. U.'S.

01:33:13.754 --> 01:33:16.123
SECURITIZATION WAS ALLOWED

01:33:16.190 --> 01:33:19.427
DISSLY AND IT THE CONDITIONS

01:33:19.493 --> 01:33:21.662
THAT HAVE TO BE SATISFIED ARE

01:33:21.729 --> 01:33:24.265
LISTED AS TO WHAT NEEDS TO BE

01:33:24.332 --> 01:33:27.802
DONE. BUT EVEN BEFORE WE GET TO

01:33:27.868 --> 01:33:30.738
THAT THE ARE YOU- YOU HAD TO

01:33:30.805 --> 01:33:33.274
ESTABLISH A STANDARD OF

01:33:33.341 --> 01:33:35.710
REASONABLE CONDUCT. THERE WAS

01:33:35.776 --> 01:33:39.680
SERIOUS QUESTION FOR THE YEAR

01:33:39.747 --> 01:33:41.015
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN REGARDING

01:33:41.082 --> 01:33:43.818
THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE I'LL USE

01:33:43.884 --> 01:33:45.653
AND THAT WAS A THRESHOLD THAT

01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:48.155
HAVE TO BE OVERCOME BEFORE WE

01:33:48.222 --> 01:33:49.390
EVER TALKED ABOUT JUST AND

01:33:49.457 --> 01:33:52.226
REASONABLE. THAT IS A CONCERN

01:33:52.293 --> 01:33:54.862
THAT I HAVE REGARDING- WHAT

01:33:54.929 --> 01:33:56.731
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY THE

01:33:56.797 --> 01:33:58.366
EMPHASIS HAS BEEN ON

01:33:58.432 --> 01:34:00.134
SECURITISATION BUT I THINK EVEN

01:34:00.201 --> 01:34:02.136
BEFORE WE GET TO SECURITIZATION.

01:34:02.203 --> 01:34:04.605
IT'S DETERMINING WHETHER IT IS

01:34:04.672 --> 01:34:06.207
THE FACT THAT IT ONLY SAID

01:34:06.273 --> 01:34:09.076
REASONABLE FOR I'M GLAD THE I AM

01:34:09.143 --> 01:34:10.678
VERY GLAD THAT THE AMENDMENT WAS

01:34:10.745 --> 01:34:12.980
ACCEPTED BECAUSE THAT WAS A

01:34:13.047 --> 01:34:15.016
STANDARD THAT WAS PUT IN NINE TO

01:34:15.082 --> 01:34:16.717
ONE. THE WHEN WE LOOK EVEN IF

01:34:16.784 --> 01:34:18.953
THE ANALYSIS WHICH WAS. VERY

01:34:19.020 --> 01:34:21.155
WELL DONE. AND WE LOOK AT THE

01:34:21.222 --> 01:34:23.891
EXISTING LAW EXISTING LAW ALLOWS

01:34:23.958 --> 01:34:25.960
FOR THIS BUT EXISTING LAW ALSO

01:34:26.027 --> 01:34:28.229
REQUIRES THE STANDARD OF

01:34:28.295 --> 01:34:30.698
REASONABLE CONDUCT OF THE- I OWE

01:34:30.765 --> 01:34:32.833
YOU BEFORE THEY CAN EVER GET TO

01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:35.102
THAT. BECAUSE IF THEIR CONDUCT

01:34:35.169 --> 01:34:37.571
WAS NOT REASONABLE. FOR THAT

01:34:37.638 --> 01:34:39.874
PARTICULAR WILDFIRE. THEN

01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:42.109
THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO GET TO THE

01:34:42.176 --> 01:34:43.544
SECOND STEP OF JUST AND

01:34:43.611 --> 01:34:45.679
REASONABLE THAT THEN ALLOWS YOU

01:34:45.746 --> 01:34:49.283
TO GET TO SECURITIZATION. SO I

01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:52.053
IT'S AN OUTSTANDING ISSUE I WILL

01:34:52.119 --> 01:34:54.522
BE SPEAKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND

01:34:54.588 --> 01:34:56.757

TO WALK ME THROUGH THIS AGAIN-

01:34:59.627 --> 01:35:02.596
BUT IT IS A CONCERN SO FOR TODAY

01:35:02.663 --> 01:35:04.532
I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT AND

01:35:04.598 --> 01:35:05.933

WHERE THAT TURNED LETTER WAS AND

01:35:21.048 --> 01:35:24.218
SO FINALLY THAT CA- AND IN SO

01:35:24.285 --> 01:35:26.387
CAN WE- AND I APOLOGIZE IF I GOT

01:35:26.454 --> 01:35:27.788
HERE LEAD TO THE SPREAD OF

01:35:27.855 --> 01:35:29.123
ALREADY BEEN COVER CAN WE-

01:35:29.190 --> 01:35:32.259
QUICKLY GO OVER THE AMENDMENTS

01:35:32.326 --> 01:35:33.761
THAT WERE TAKEN AND COMMITTEE.

01:35:33.828 --> 01:35:35.396
THAT'S MY FIRST QUESTION THAT I

01:35:35.463 --> 01:35:38.766
THE PUBLIC PLACE TO. SO WE HAVE

01:35:38.833 --> 01:35:41.202
BUT THREE PARTICULAR AMENDMENTS

01:35:41.268 --> 01:35:43.270
THAT ARE HIGHLIGHTED AS THE

01:35:43.337 --> 01:35:45.005
FIRST REMOVED CLIMATE ADAPTATION

01:35:45.072 --> 01:35:46.974
COSTS EXPENSES CHANGE A

01:35:47.041 --> 01:35:49.210
CONSIDERATION THAT SECURITIZED

01:35:49.276 --> 01:35:51.212
BONDS MOMENT MUST REDUCE RATES

01:35:51.278 --> 01:35:53.814
CLARIFIES THAT THE PRESUMPTION

01:35:53.881 --> 01:35:55.216
OF SHORT TERM RATE STABILITY WAS

01:35:55.282 --> 01:35:56.851
ONLY IF THE CPUC AUTHORIZE THOSE

01:35:56.917 --> 01:35:58.919
COSTS TO BE PAID DOWN UNDER

01:35:58.986 --> 01:36:01.655
TRADITIONAL MEANS- THOSE ARE THE

01:36:01.722 --> 01:36:03.023
AMENDMENTS THAT WE'RE PUTTING

01:36:03.090 --> 01:36:05.826
FORWARD AND THEY HAVE BEEN

01:36:05.893 --> 01:36:07.628
ACCEPTED BY THE AUTHOR. OKAY SO

01:36:07.695 --> 01:36:09.897
F. AS I'M READING THE LETTER

01:36:09.964 --> 01:36:12.533
FROM TURN A BIG PART OF IT WAS

01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:13.934
AROUND CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND

01:36:14.001 --> 01:36:15.336
THAT'S BEEN REMOVED SO THAT'S

01:36:15.402 --> 01:36:19.206
BEEN ADDRESSED- A PART OF IT-

01:36:19.273 --> 01:36:21.242
WITH. MAKES SENSE ABOUT MAKING

01:36:21.308 --> 01:36:22.710
SURE THAT RATES ARE GOING TO BE

01:36:22.776 --> 01:36:24.778
REDUCED TO A WHICH IS I THINK

01:36:24.845 --> 01:36:26.213
AND- BUT THEN THE MISSION THERE.

01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:27.681
ARE AND THEN THEY'RE STILL THE

01:36:27.748 --> 01:36:28.749
PENDING QUESTIONS AND I THINK A

01:36:28.816 --> 01:36:30.918
LITTLE BIT ALIGNED BUT NOT

01:36:30.985 --> 01:36:32.486
EXACTLY WHERE- WHAT ARE.

01:36:32.553 --> 01:36:33.654
MAJORITY LEADER WAS TALKING

01:36:33.721 --> 01:36:36.123
ABOUT THE CATASTROPHIC FIRES OF

01:36:36.190 --> 01:36:36.824
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND ALL

01:36:36.891 --> 01:36:38.392
THAT WORK THAT WAS DONE THROUGH

01:36:38.459 --> 01:36:39.660
THAT WORKING GROUP THAT

01:36:39.727 --> 01:36:40.961
CONFERENCE IN. THE BILL THAT WE

01:36:41.028 --> 01:36:44.498
EVENTUALLY HAD. INSIDE I DO HOPE

01:36:44.565 --> 01:36:46.734
YOU CAN GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE

01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:49.203
CAN FIND- COMMON GROUND WITH

01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:51.505
TURN IT DOWN A LOT OF WORK IN

01:36:51.572 --> 01:36:53.207
THAT DIRECTION ALREADY AND I

01:36:53.274 --> 01:36:53.908
WANT TO A KNOWLEDGE. THAT WITH

01:36:53.974 --> 01:36:56.076
THESE EVENTS AND APART BE EIGHT

01:36:56.143 --> 01:36:59.780
THAT- I WILL SAY THAT- SHORT

01:36:59.847 --> 01:37:01.515
TERM REDUCE YOUR RATE SOUNDS

01:37:01.582 --> 01:37:03.984
GREAT. LONG TERM THE REST WITH

01:37:04.051 --> 01:37:05.819
THE VERY. WITH INTEREST RATES

01:37:05.886 --> 01:37:08.222
SHIFTING AN- HOUR THAT MEANS

01:37:08.289 --> 01:37:10.090
THAT THE SCARE ME SOMETIMES AS

01:37:10.157 --> 01:37:12.126
THE LAST LOOK AT THESE MECHANICS

01:37:12.193 --> 01:37:13.894
AND THE RISKS THAT ARE. THAT ARE

01:37:13.961 --> 01:37:14.828
THERE. AND SOME A LITTLE BIT

01:37:14.895 --> 01:37:16.163
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH WITH SOME OF

01:37:16.230 --> 01:37:18.132
THIS SCHEMATICS OF THIS BILL

01:37:18.199 --> 01:37:19.433
BUT- I AM COMFORTABLE ENOUGH TO

01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:22.336
VOTE FOR IT. AT TODAY. THE ONE

01:37:22.403 --> 01:37:23.804
THING I DO KNOW IS THAT RATES

01:37:23.871 --> 01:37:25.172
ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO

01:37:25.239 --> 01:37:26.674
INCREASE THIS YEAR ALONE WE SEE

01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:28.142
MULTIPLE RATE INCREASES. AT THE

01:37:28.209 --> 01:37:30.044
VETS HAVE HAVE BEEN. TALKING TO

01:37:30.110 --> 01:37:31.845
US AND WHETHER OR NOT THIS IT'S

01:37:31.912 --> 01:37:35.216
OVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO YOU

01:37:35.282 --> 01:37:36.083
AFFECTED I THINK A FAIR. FAIR

01:37:36.150 --> 01:37:38.419
QUESTION THAT WITH THE PATTERSON

01:37:38.485 --> 01:37:40.154
IS SPRINGING UP- AS WELL AND NO

01:37:40.221 --> 01:37:41.589
NO WE CAN'T USE THAT THIS WHOLE

01:37:41.655 --> 01:37:43.290
DISCUSSION IS MOOT ANYWAY SINCE-

01:37:43.357 --> 01:37:44.992
RATES WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BE

01:37:45.059 --> 01:37:45.826
LARGE ENOUGH ANYWAY SPENT

01:37:45.893 --> 01:37:47.928
THINKING. BECAUSE YOU SAID MR

01:37:47.995 --> 01:37:49.763
PATTERSON'S NAME ME WANTS TO SAY

01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:52.600
SOMETHING AYE AYES RIGHT LET HIM

01:37:52.666 --> 01:37:55.903
GOOD QUESTION- I KNOW THAT.

01:37:55.970 --> 01:37:57.938
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

01:37:58.005 --> 01:38:02.009
REDUCING RATES. AND REDUCING THE

01:38:02.076 --> 01:38:05.379
INCREASE OF THE RATES. I WANT TO

01:38:05.446 --> 01:38:09.783
KNOW THAT THIS REDUCES RATES.

01:38:09.850 --> 01:38:11.952
AND NOT MERELY REDUCES THE

01:38:12.019 --> 01:38:15.422
POTENTIAL INCREASE IN THE RATES

01:38:15.489 --> 01:38:18.592
. CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT PLEASE.

01:38:18.659 --> 01:38:21.295
YEAH I'M HAPPY TO UP TO BE

01:38:21.362 --> 01:38:23.564
TOTALLY CANDID I MEAN I THINK IF

01:38:23.631 --> 01:38:26.300
YOU LOOK AT THE REDUCTION OF

01:38:26.367 --> 01:38:29.103
ELECTRICITY RATES. SPREADING OUT

01:38:29.169 --> 01:38:30.838
THE COST A BIG CHUNK OF COSTS

01:38:30.904 --> 01:38:34.074
OVER MORE TIME IN YEAR ONE TWO

01:38:34.141 --> 01:38:35.276
THREE AT CETERA WILL REDUCE

01:38:35.342 --> 01:38:37.478
RATES. THE THING IS IT'S VERY

01:38:37.544 --> 01:38:39.013
DIFFICULT ALL THESE COSTS WE'RE

01:38:39.079 --> 01:38:40.347
TALKING ABOUT REAL COST

01:38:40.414 --> 01:38:41.081
NECESSARY COSTS WHILE FOR

01:38:41.148 --> 01:38:42.616
HARDENING IT CETERA THOSE ARE

01:38:42.683 --> 01:38:44.585
GOING TO HAVE TO BE RECOVERED.

01:38:44.652 --> 01:38:45.619
THROUGH CUSTOMERS THAT'S THE

01:38:45.686 --> 01:38:47.187
REGULATORY COMPACT THAT'S THE

01:38:47.254 --> 01:38:49.623
TIME WE HAVE. I WOULD SAY THAT

01:38:49.690 --> 01:38:51.792
THE ALTERNATIVE TO SPREADING IT

01:38:51.859 --> 01:38:53.560
OUT BE A SECURITIZATION IS

01:38:53.627 --> 01:38:55.462
AMORTIZATION AND GETTING IT OVER

01:38:55.529 --> 01:38:56.930
A MUCH SHORTER TIME PERIOD SO

01:38:56.997 --> 01:39:00.034
IT'S HIGHER SO. I WOULD SAY THE

01:39:00.100 --> 01:39:01.669
SAME ABOUT BUCKET ACOSTA IF YOU

01:39:01.735 --> 01:39:03.103
SPREAD IT OUT OVER. THE RATES

01:39:03.170 --> 01:39:05.172
MOVING THING WE'VE BEEN TALKING

01:39:05.239 --> 01:39:06.940
ABOUT IT'S GOING TO REDUCE RATES

01:39:07.007 --> 01:39:08.609
FOR CUSTOMERS IN THE EARLY YEARS

01:39:08.676 --> 01:39:10.044
IT'S JUST LIKE BUYING A CAR IF

01:39:10.110 --> 01:39:13.013
YOU PAY YOU KNOW FULL PRICE AT

01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:14.915
THE DOOR IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE ALL

01:39:14.982 --> 01:39:16.083
UP FRONT. DO YOU THAT DO USE

01:39:16.150 --> 01:39:18.819

YEAR IS MUCH LOWER SO THAT'S THE

01:39:24.024 --> 01:39:26.293
WAY WE VIEW AND THAT'S WHY WE

01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:26.994
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE

01:39:27.061 --> 01:39:28.662

IGNITIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PROVEN-

01:55:05.632 --> 01:55:07.634

01:55:21.981 --> 01:55:23.049
SOLUTION THAT WE'VE COME UP WITH

01:55:23.116 --> 01:55:24.851
THE LAST COUPLE YEARS WHERE WE

01:55:24.917 --> 01:55:27.353

WHY THIS IS AT CORE LOCAL LABOR

01:55:32.792 --> 01:55:35.094

THE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE ARTIST

01:56:45.264 --> 01:56:46.065
MIGHT DO WITH THIS WORK BECAUSE

01:56:46.132 --> 01:56:47.667

ECOG TALK ABOUT IT THIS MIGHT

01:56:56.976 --> 01:57:01.247
MORE LOCALIZED ISSUE BUT WE'RE

TO EMERGENCIES OR OTHER THINGS

01:57:14.060 --> 01:57:15.828
THAT WE THINK THIS COULD CREATE

01:57:15.895 --> 01:57:18.030
A LOT OF PAPER TRANSFERRED TO

01:57:18.097 --> 01:57:19.499

THE FACT THAT IT'S JUST FOR A

02:15:57.749 --> 02:15:59.751
HARD FOUGHT BUT AREAS ALSO IS

02:15:59.818 --> 02:16:02.687
GOING TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF.

02:16:02.754 --> 02:16:04.656
SIX THAT ARE BEING DONE. REQUIRE

ALL OF CALIFORNIA OR JUST THE

02:16:14.733 --> 02:16:16.735
HIGH FIRE THREAT AREAS. THAT

02:16:16.801 --> 02:16:18.470
SPECIFIC TO OUR SERVICE

02:16:18.537 --> 02:16:19.204
TERRITORY WITHOUT HIGH

FIREFIGHTERS AT ALL I THINK. OF

02:16:22.107 --> 02:16:23.708
WHICH I'M NOT SURE I'D HAVE TO

02:16:23.775 --> 02:16:25.577
LOOK AT OVERLAP WE HAVE AS

02:16:25.644 --> 02:16:26.578
DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY WE HAVE

02:16:26.645 --> 02:16:28.780
OVER THREE THOUSAND MILES OF

02:16:28.847 --> 02:16:30.248
TRANSMISSION LINES IN HIGH FIRE

02:16:30.315 --> 02:16:31.750

02:16:31.816 --> 02:16:33.418
THOUSAND MILES OF. DISTRIBUTION

02:16:33.485 --> 02:16:35.153
LINES HIGH FURTHER TERRITORIES.

02:16:35.220 --> 02:16:37.022

TIMES OF THE YEAR OR BY SHE'S

02:16:41.293 --> 02:16:44.062
THIS THE- BEST DIFFERENT THAT

02:16:44.129 --> 02:16:48.900
BORDER. WHETHER BACK TO THE

02:16:48.967 --> 02:16:50.669
LOCAL ORDINANCE WE SEE BECAUSE-

02:16:50.735 --> 02:16:52.037
THE OFFICE SAID THAT WE HAD TO

02:16:52.103 --> 02:16:54.072
PAY FIRED FOR THE CALL TO DEPLOY

02:16:54.139 --> 02:16:56.041
OUR TROOPS. ARE LARGER CIRCLE.

02:16:56.107 --> 02:16:57.842
MAY IT WAS IT'S BEEN SAID THAT

02:16:57.909 --> 02:16:59.711
WE HAVE FOR TRUCKS AROUND WE

02:16:59.778 --> 02:17:01.413
DON'T. ACCEPT DO NOT GOING FAR

02:17:01.479 --> 02:17:03.548
TRUCKS THERE. A WORKER THAT HAVE

02:17:03.615 --> 02:17:05.150
FIRE FIVE SKILLS. AND IF A FIVE

02:17:05.216 --> 02:17:06.251
IGNITES WE ARE REQUIRED. TO CALL

02:17:06.318 --> 02:17:07.786
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. SO THEY

02:17:07.852 --> 02:17:08.820
WILL BE NOTIFIED IN THAT

02:17:08.887 --> 02:17:11.590
INSTANCE WE HAVE VERY CLEAR

02:17:11.656 --> 02:17:12.657
REQUIREMENTS ABOUT OUR USE OF

02:17:12.724 --> 02:17:14.225
THESE. CREWS IN OUR WATER

02:17:14.292 --> 02:17:15.961
MITIGATION PLAN IT COVERS OVER

02:17:16.027 --> 02:17:17.529
TWENTY PAGES I BELIEVE ABOUT

02:17:17.596 --> 02:17:19.431
WHEN AND WHERE AND WHY WE USE

02:17:19.497 --> 02:17:22.734
THESE CRITTERS. THERE'S TO.

02:17:22.801 --> 02:17:24.402
TWENTY PERSON CREWS CURRENTLY

02:17:24.469 --> 02:17:25.937
THAT WE- THAT WE HAVE THAT ARE

02:17:26.004 --> 02:17:28.073
TRAINED TO DO THIS TYPE OF WORK.

02:17:28.139 --> 02:17:29.608
AGAIN IT'S TO REDUCE RISK IT'S-

02:17:29.674 --> 02:17:32.477
IN OUR WITH. OUR WATER

02:17:32.544 --> 02:17:34.112
MITIGATION PLANS COVER OVER I

02:17:34.179 --> 02:17:37.649
BELIEVE SEVEN HOT. WHAT WE ARE.

02:17:37.716 --> 02:17:40.218
THIS WORK IS WITHOUT INSTANCES

02:17:40.285 --> 02:17:45.223
OF- FIRES BEING IGNITED IT SEEMS

02:17:45.290 --> 02:17:47.425
COUNTERINTUITIVE TO REGULATE OUR

02:17:47.492 --> 02:17:48.426
USE OF THESE CAREERS THAT ARE

02:17:48.493 --> 02:17:50.762
THERE TO REDUCE RISK INTO LOWER

02:17:50.829 --> 02:17:55.367
VEGETATION AND TO. CUT OUT ANY

02:17:55.433 --> 02:17:56.901
ADDITIONAL FIRES I COULD SPEAK

02:17:56.968 --> 02:17:59.904
AGAIN WOULD NOT REALLY CLEAR

02:17:59.971 --> 02:18:00.872
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE IT. I

02:18:00.939 --> 02:18:03.608
THINK I WANT TO GO BACK TO WHAT

02:18:03.675 --> 02:18:05.877
MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE. DR QUIRK.

02:18:05.944 --> 02:18:09.814
THAT IF. A FIRE DISTRICT SAYS

02:18:09.881 --> 02:18:12.150
GIVE US THE NOTICE THEM TO

02:18:12.217 --> 02:18:14.552
FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GIVE THEM

02:18:14.619 --> 02:18:16.354
THE NOTICE THAT ISN'T WITH THE

02:18:16.421 --> 02:18:19.457
BILL SAYS BUT- THE END OF. IF

02:18:19.524 --> 02:18:22.627
YOUR DISTRICT WANT IT AND IT

02:18:22.694 --> 02:18:25.063
TOOK AWHILE TO GET IT THEN MAYBE

02:18:25.130 --> 02:18:26.665
SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE SO

02:18:26.731 --> 02:18:30.135
THAT- THE FIRE DISTRICTS DON'T

02:18:30.201 --> 02:18:32.604
HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL THROUGH

02:18:32.671 --> 02:18:34.105
LIVE. TO WITH THE FIRE JUST

02:18:34.172 --> 02:18:37.275
DOESN'T WANT IT THEN CLEARLY YOU

02:18:37.342 --> 02:18:39.444
WOULDN'T HAVE TO PROVIDE IT. BUT

02:18:39.511 --> 02:18:42.180
IT TO GIVE THAT OPTION TO THE

02:18:42.247 --> 02:18:45.016
FIRE DISTRICT IT'S A DIFFICULT

02:18:45.083 --> 02:18:47.052
ONE I AM GOING TO GIVE A

02:18:47.118 --> 02:18:50.188
COURTESY- I VOTE. AND SEE HOW

02:18:50.255 --> 02:18:54.392
HOW THIS. PROCEEDS TO FIGURE OUT

02:18:54.459 --> 02:18:57.462
IF INDEED IT IS. A SOLUTION

02:18:57.529 --> 02:18:59.564
LOOKING FOR A PROBLEM. BUT I

02:18:59.631 --> 02:19:01.132
WILL TELL YOU THAT THE TESTIMONY

02:19:01.199 --> 02:19:04.135
OF THE FIRE CHIEF MAKES. A BIG

02:19:04.202 --> 02:19:06.438
DIFFERENCE IN THIS BECAUSE IT IS

02:19:06.504 --> 02:19:09.374
A LIFE EXPERIENCE AND WITH THE

02:19:09.441 --> 02:19:11.342
WILD FIRES WE HAD. THE LAST

02:19:11.409 --> 02:19:14.112
THING WE WANT IS TO CUT CORNERS

02:19:14.179 --> 02:19:16.381
AND NOT TAKE CARE OF SOMETHING

02:19:16.448 --> 02:19:18.216
THAT POTENTIALLY COULD CAUSE

02:19:18.283 --> 02:19:21.386
SERIOUS. PROBLEMS AND LOSS OF

02:19:21.453 --> 02:19:26.925
LIFE AND PROPERTY. SO I HAVE A

02:19:26.991 --> 02:19:27.726
QUESTION AND THEN PROBABLY

02:19:27.792 --> 02:19:29.327
ANOTHER FOLLOW UP QUESTION ON

02:19:29.394 --> 02:19:30.862
THE ON THE CIVIL PENALTY PIECE.

02:19:30.929 --> 02:19:32.897
IS THE PENALTY ASSESSED THE

02:19:32.964 --> 02:19:35.333
FAILURE TO PROVIDE THE WRECKED

02:19:35.400 --> 02:19:37.502
QUIZ THAT NOTICE IS IT A PER

02:19:37.569 --> 02:19:39.704
OCCURRENCE TYPE PENALTY. THE

02:19:39.771 --> 02:19:42.140
EXACT CORRECT YES FOR EVERY

02:19:42.207 --> 02:19:45.410
NOTED FAILURE TO NOTIFY OKAY SO

02:19:45.477 --> 02:19:47.145
. I'M TRYING TO WEIGH THE COST

02:19:47.212 --> 02:19:48.980
BENEFIT ON THAT BECAUSE- IT

02:19:49.047 --> 02:19:52.050
SEEMS LIKE. ANOTHER WAY TO GET

02:19:52.117 --> 02:19:53.852
UP ON A TRENARY RAGE FILLED BUT

02:19:53.918 --> 02:19:55.820
I MEAN ANOTHER WAY TO GO WOULD

02:19:55.887 --> 02:19:57.088
BE YOU KNOW THERE'S A CIVIL

02:19:57.155 --> 02:19:58.656
PENALTY THE NOTE REQUIRED

02:19:58.723 --> 02:20:00.291
CONSENT AND THEIR SON

02:20:00.358 --> 02:20:02.060
DEMONSTRABLE HARM THE RESULTS

02:20:02.127 --> 02:20:04.529
AND THEN THE PENALTY MAYBE IS

02:20:04.596 --> 02:20:07.232
HIGHER. BUT THE MY CONCERN PANEL

02:20:07.298 --> 02:20:09.834
THING THE- S. THE LACK VIæT

02:20:09.901 --> 02:20:12.370
NOTICED THE BOARD- THE INCENTIVE

02:20:12.437 --> 02:20:13.772
FOR THE UTILITIES IS JUST TO

02:20:13.838 --> 02:20:15.540
JUST BE BLANKETING EVERYBODY IN

02:20:15.607 --> 02:20:17.642
ASSISTIVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAYES

02:20:17.709 --> 02:20:20.111
POINT AND- ALSO THE- ADDRESSES

02:20:20.178 --> 02:20:22.680
POINT I MEAN THERE'S SORT OF

02:20:22.747 --> 02:20:23.681

REAR. THIS IS CONSTANTLY AND

02:20:27.852 --> 02:20:30.722
THEN I WONDER WHAT. THE YOU KNOW

02:20:30.789 --> 02:20:32.991
IS THERE A DAY LUCIA FACT I MEAN

02:20:33.057 --> 02:20:35.260

02:20:35.326 --> 02:20:36.795
BE. FILED WHEN PEOPLE GET THEM

02:20:36.861 --> 02:20:39.264
WHEN MAY IT MAYBE IT COULD BE

02:20:39.330 --> 02:20:39.798
NARROWED SO THAT. THERE'S

02:20:39.864 --> 02:20:41.866
LIABILITY THAT'S MAYBE HIGHER

02:20:41.933 --> 02:20:43.835
BUT I'M SURE THE UTILITIES WOULD

02:20:43.902 --> 02:20:45.837
LOVE THAT YEAH BUT THE IF THERE

02:22:07.685 --> 02:22:09.988
LIVES TO DO SOMETHING RIGHT AND

02:22:10.054 --> 02:22:11.589
I THINK THAT'S WHAT THESE FIRE

02:22:11.656 --> 02:22:15.226
CHIEFS ARE TRYING TO DO THEIR TO

02:22:15.293 --> 02:22:16.127
SET A TRIAL TO SEE A COMMUTE

02:22:16.194 --> 02:22:17.729
FRONT END RIGHT AND IF YOU DO

02:22:17.795 --> 02:22:19.364
THAT LET DO THAT LET'S THIS

02:22:19.430 --> 02:22:22.767
NOTICE. YEAH IS IT. SOUNDS LIKE

02:22:22.834 --> 02:22:23.801
FROM THE CHIEFS. BECAUSE THERE

02:22:23.868 --> 02:22:25.336
ARE THESE TWO ARE. AND THAT ARE

02:22:25.403 --> 02:22:25.937
GOING CITIZENS. ONEROUS IT IS

02:22:26.004 --> 02:22:28.339
NOT A LOT OF NOTED. THAT DOES

02:22:28.406 --> 02:22:30.008
NOT QUANTIFY THE WAY WE'VE BEEN

02:22:30.074 --> 02:22:30.942
HEARING FROM THE OPPOSITION- BUT

02:22:31.009 --> 02:22:33.077
I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE TRY

02:22:33.144 --> 02:22:34.145
TO DO SOMETHING ON THE FRONT TO

02:22:34.212 --> 02:22:35.713
PREVENT THESE FIRES. I DO THINK

02:22:35.780 --> 02:22:37.615
THAT IS A CRITICAL STEP THIS

02:22:37.682 --> 02:22:39.183
LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE TAKING BUT

02:22:39.250 --> 02:22:39.784
I'M- A LAST YOU'VE MEYER HE

02:22:39.851 --> 02:22:41.686
WANTS TO ADD ANYTHING ON THE

02:22:41.753 --> 02:22:44.555
RISK RETURN TO PREVENT. BUT YET.

02:22:44.622 --> 02:22:46.491
THANK YOU SO REMEMBER THE ONLY

02:22:46.557 --> 02:22:48.192

02:22:48.259 --> 02:22:50.528
NUMBER ONE- HAVE THAT FIRE

02:22:50.595 --> 02:22:52.430
STARTED. IN EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION

02:22:52.497 --> 02:22:54.432
DOLLARS- FROM HOT WORK. WE HAVE

02:22:54.499 --> 02:22:56.768
BEEN CALLED OUT. AFTER THE FACT

02:22:56.834 --> 02:22:58.603
BY A CITIZEN WITH AN EXPLOSION.

02:22:58.670 --> 02:23:00.605
IN A TRANSFORMER. SO IT DOES

02:23:00.672 --> 02:23:02.607
HAPPEN. SO THIS IDEA THAT IT'S

02:23:02.674 --> 02:23:03.942
NEVER HAPPENED. IT'S JUST THAT I

02:23:04.008 --> 02:23:06.377
THINK THAT THE- NO- COMMITTEE

02:23:06.444 --> 02:23:08.279
SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT THAT'S

02:23:08.346 --> 02:23:09.814

02:23:09.881 --> 02:23:11.950
ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT. YEAH THEY

02:23:12.016 --> 02:23:18.723
DO HAVE THE STATE. WHICH ARE. I

02:23:18.790 --> 02:23:22.126
TOLD HIM SETTING THE THEIR JOB.
