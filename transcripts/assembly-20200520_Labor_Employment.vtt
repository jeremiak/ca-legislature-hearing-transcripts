AND YOU CANNOT EVEN TAKE A TO

02:52:28.638 --> 02:52:32.008
USE THE RESTROOM OR WASH HANDS

02:52:32.075 --> 02:52:33.242
WITHOUT THAT THIRTEEN YOUR CALL

02:52:33.309 --> 02:52:35.178
AND THAT TOO IN LAW INTO THE

02:52:35.244 --> 02:52:39.282
FIRE. IS NOT. WE SHOULD BE

02:52:39.348 --> 02:52:41.084
TALKING ON THE CENTURY. THIS IS

02:52:41.150 --> 02:52:43.186
ALTHOUGH NOW IT'S AN AN AOP OR

02:52:43.252 --> 02:52:45.855
A- TECHNOLOGICAL WAY OF

02:52:45.922 --> 02:52:47.490
DETERMINING HOW FAST SOMEBODY

02:52:47.557 --> 02:52:48.725
GOING IT'S NOT THAT DIFFERENT

02:52:48.791 --> 02:52:50.893
THAN THE ASSEMBLY LINE. AND WE

02:52:50.960 --> 02:52:51.728
NEED TO ENSURE THAT THESE

02:52:51.794 --> 02:52:53.162
WORKERS HAVE SOME BASIC LEVEL

02:52:53.229 --> 02:52:55.331
OF PROTECTION. IF YOU HAVE TO

02:52:55.398 --> 02:52:58.501
USE THE RESTROOM. IF YOU HAVE

02:52:58.568 --> 02:53:00.036

THESE DEATHS ONE OF OCCURRED.

02:53:05.308 --> 02:53:06.909
AND SO I THINK IT'S MORE THAN

02:53:06.976 --> 02:53:08.878
EVER TO ENSURE THAT. AS

02:53:08.945 --> 02:53:10.913
EMPLOYERS CHANGE THEIR MODELS

02:53:10.980 --> 02:53:13.015
AND THESE QUOTAS GETS BAD UP IN

02:53:13.082 --> 02:53:15.384
ORDER TO AVOID OVER TIME. THEY

02:53:15.451 --> 02:53:17.220
GET SPIT UP AT DIFFERENT TIMES

02:53:17.286 --> 02:53:18.788
SO YOU'RE ALREADY GOING VERY

02:53:18.855 --> 02:53:19.922
FAST PACE AND THEN YOU'RE

02:53:19.989 --> 02:53:21.290

02:53:21.357 --> 02:53:23.092
YOU DON'T REACH THE OVERTIME

02:53:23.159 --> 02:53:26.162

CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND FOR WE

04:55:48.130 --> 04:55:49.331
ARE TO THE BILL. WE'RE

04:55:49.398 --> 04:55:50.399
CERTAINLY SYMPATHETIC.

04:55:50.466 --> 04:55:51.600
SITUATION INVOLVING WORKERS WHO

04:55:51.667 --> 04:55:54.103

TO A DEATH OF A FAMILY MEMBER

04:55:56.572 --> 04:55:57.673
WELL WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH IS

04:55:57.739 --> 04:56:01.276
THE APPROACH TAKEN IN THIS BILL

04:56:01.343 --> 04:56:04.346
WHICH IS A NEW SCANDAL A

04:56:04.413 --> 04:56:05.147
SECTION OF THE- CODE THAT HAS A

04:56:05.214 --> 04:56:07.182
GREEN. AND EIGHT WE HAVE CAN.

04:56:07.249 --> 04:56:08.851
WHICH TEN DAY MANDATE IS MUCH

04:56:08.917 --> 04:56:10.853
MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN PRIOR

04:56:10.919 --> 04:56:12.054
LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS THAT HAVE

04:56:12.121 --> 04:56:15.124
BEEN EITHER THREE OR FOUR DAYS-

04:56:15.190 --> 04:56:16.592
AND WE ARE CONCERNED AGAIN WITH

04:56:16.658 --> 04:56:18.093
THIS BRAND NEW. SECTION THE

04:56:18.160 --> 04:56:20.095
LABOR CODE- STANDALONE SEXUALLY

04:56:20.162 --> 04:56:22.131
RECORD WITH A PRIVATE RIGHT OF

04:56:22.197 --> 04:56:24.600
ACTION- WE THINK IS GOING TO

04:56:24.666 --> 04:56:27.436
LEAD TO FURTHER COSTLY

04:56:27.503 --> 04:56:30.172
LITIGATION- AND WHAT WE'RE- AS

04:56:30.239 --> 04:56:31.406
A MINISTER. OFFICE THAT

04:56:31.473 --> 04:56:33.575
WHATEVER THE PRIVATE RIDE BACK.

04:56:33.642 --> 04:56:35.277
THERE WAS A CHANGE IN APPROACH

04:56:35.344 --> 04:56:36.979
SO THE PRIMARY ELECTION IS

04:56:37.045 --> 04:56:38.247
STILL THE BILL. I WON ALL

04:56:38.313 --> 04:56:41.683
MENTION THE- SOME MUCH IN THIS

04:56:41.750 --> 04:56:45.787
IS ON AN ORGAN STATUTE- AN

04:56:45.854 --> 04:56:48.790
ORGAN DID ENACT A TEN DAY. BUT

04:56:48.857 --> 04:56:49.958
LEAVE STATUTES THEY DID IT IN A

04:56:50.025 --> 04:56:51.126

04:56:51.193 --> 04:56:52.995
THEY BUILT ON TO THEIR ORGAN

04:56:53.061 --> 04:56:56.698
FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE ACT. SO IT

04:56:56.765 --> 04:56:58.133
IT COUNTS AS PART OF TWELVE

04:56:58.200 --> 04:56:59.034
WEEKS OF UNPAID LEAVE THAT

04:56:59.101 --> 04:57:00.802

04:57:03.872 --> 04:57:04.740
THAT'S A LOT PLACE ONLY TWO

THIRDS OF A CERTAIN SIZE

04:57:07.976 --> 04:57:10.045

MORE BETTER COMPLETED ON TIME

05:29:31.451 --> 05:29:32.886
AND UNDER BUDGET I THINK IS A

05:29:32.953 --> 05:29:35.522
GOOD THING. EVERYBODY INCLUDING

05:29:35.589 --> 05:29:36.490
