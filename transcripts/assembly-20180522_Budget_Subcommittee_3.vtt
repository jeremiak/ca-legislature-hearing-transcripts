UNFORTUNATE OUR RESEARCHERS

00:28:45.891 --> 00:28:49.461 region:rollup2
SHOWN THAT THAT LAST OPTION IS

00:28:47.693 --> 00:28:50.696 region:rollup2
QUITE COSTLY.

00:28:49.461 --> 00:28:52.130 region:rollup2
IN FACT WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE

00:28:50.696 --> 00:28:53.332 region:rollup2
OPERATIONAL COST OF OUR

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:54.633 region:rollup2

CHART THAT CHART TRIES TO SHOWS

00:29:05.844 --> 00:29:08.413 region:rollup2
THAT SHOW THAT DISTINCTION OF

00:29:07.346 --> 00:29:10.482 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH MONEY WE WE WOULD BE

00:29:08.413 --> 00:29:11.883 region:rollup2
SPENT ON THE OPEN MARKET. AND

00:29:10.482 --> 00:29:13.485 region:rollup2
