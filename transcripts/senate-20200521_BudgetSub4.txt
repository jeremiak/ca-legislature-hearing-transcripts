IN THIS OP CATEGORY THAT YOU HAVE IDENTIFIED WHICH IS THE A DENTIST A DENTAL VERIFICATION AND- THE SOONER THAT THAT BACKLOG CAN GET TAKEN CARE OF I THINK WE'LL SEE THE NUMBER CALLS GO DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY BECAUSE- THE LONGER IT TAKES AND PEOPLE GET MORE AND MORE DESPERATE AND- THAT'S WHEN THEY START REACHING. REWIND SO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT WE- POINT. WHEN THIS PANDEMIC STARTED IN THAT YOU STAFF FOR THAT THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE DO AND- AND I THINK YOU'VE DONE A TREMENDOUS JOB OF PULLING IN AS MANY RESOURCES AS POSSIBLE AND SO DID OR ONE ON LETTING US KNOW IF THERE'S OTHER ANY OTHER THING THAT YOU NEED TO HELP YOUR GET YOUR JOB DONE.

DONNELLY BECAUSE IT'LL HELP MAINTAIN EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE. RELATIONS AND ALSO REDUCE THE RISK- THAT ANY SAVINGS WE MIGHT SCORE IN THE BUDGET IN THIS AREA. WOULD BE REVERSED THROUGH FUTURE LITIGATION ACTION- ONE THING THAT WE TO DO COMMENT ON IS THAT THE SAVINGS ON A REVISION. IS BASED ON A TWO DAY PER MONTH FURLOUGH FOR TWELVE MONTHS- AND WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE ADVISE THE- ADMINISTRATION AND BARGAINING UNITS TO SEEK ALTERNATIVES TO FOR LOW'S FIRST BEFORE. AUTOMATICALLY GOING TO FOR LOANS- AND THAT'S REALLY BECAUSE FURLOUGHS CAN CREATE LONG TERM LIABILITIES FOR THE STATE FOR RESULTING FROM. INCREASED LEAVE BALANCES AND ALSO BECAUSE OF DESTRUCTION LOW'S CAN CAUSE. IS A TWENTY FOUR HOUR. RATIONS THANK YOU. VERY MUCH BUT QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE.

YEAH AND THAT SAVINGS SAVINGS AND TWENTY ONE YOU TO. THE ACTIONS WOULD MEAN FOR GOAL AND LONGER TERM SAVINGS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED OVER THE NEXT FEW AND YOU READY DOUBLE. NAME WHICH- THIS TRADE OFF. IN ADDITION REGARDING THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO SUSPEND SHALL STIRS ALREADY TO INCREASE THE STATE'S CONTRIBUTION RATE WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE PRECEDENT THAT THIS WOULD SET AND ABOUT THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE ACTION IMPACTS OUSTER IS ABILITY TO ACHIEVE OR FINDING FOR THE TEACHERS TO FIND OUT OF THE. WHAT SIX AND THIS IS OF COURSE THE GOAL OF THE FOURTEEN HOUSE RESPONDING PLAN PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE FINALLY WE KNOW THAT WE RECEIVED THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR THESE ISSUES YESTERDAY. AND WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING THAT LANGUAGE AND WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO UNDERSTAND THE FULL DETAILS OF HOW THESE PROPOSALS WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT AGAIN IS HOLD OPEN ITEM. JT THE TESTIMONY TODAY AND- THAT THAT- INCLUDES OUR DISCUSSION ITEMS ON PARTY SO WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO PART BE. WHICHIS THE HOUSING AND HOMELESS SECTION. DEATH SENATOR ON THE THERE WERE A COUPLE OF. ISSUES AREN'T THERE SOME ITEMS THAT WERE PULLING FROM THE IN IN THE VOTE ONLY YES AND SO WILL BE TAKING THOSE UP AT THE END WHEN WE TALK ABOUT- FULLER VOTE. OKAY SO. ANYTHING THAT WAS THE OLD SPEAK ON YES WE AT THE VERY END WILL DO IT AT THE VERY END YES. OKAY YEAH FOR. OKAY SO MOVING ON TO PART BE THE HOUSING AND HOMELESS. IN. THEY WERE JUST GOING TO TAKE A MINUTE HERE WELL WE- MAKE SURE THAT THE AREAS ARE CLEANED. WE HAVE A CHANGE OF STAFF. FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE ARE WATCHING OUR VIDEO. IN OREGON. BUT NO RIGHT OF THE. REALLY. WELCOME THE NEW STAFF MEMBERS THAT ARE. FOR CALLING US IN THIS SECTION. THANK. OKAY. OKAY I THINK WE'RE READY TO START ON AYE ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY FOUR WHICH IS HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS PROPOSAL AND WILL GO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON THE SIDE OF. OKAY SO THE FIRST PROPOSAL THEY SEE ON THE AGENDA HERE YES OR THE- POST- ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES- SYRUP MONEY STATE PROPOSED PROVIDES CITIES AND COUNTIES- THE AGENDA DOES A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF LAYING OUT HOW THAT MONEY WOULD. FLOW OUT. THE ONE POINT SEVEN ONE POINT THREE BILLION OF THAT WILL GO TO COUNTIES- THE FORTY TWO COUNTIES OF POPULATIONS BELOW FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND. TOWARDS A COUNTIES IT DID NOT RECEIVE ANY FEDERAL ZERO WEEKS MONEY FROM HOUSE RESOLUTION FORTY EIGHT. AND ANOTHER- ANOTHER 50% OF THAT MONEY WILL GO TO COUNTY OPERATIONS OR FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DID RECEIVE CHARM FEDERAL- SIERRA FOR WEEKS MONEY. AND ALL THAT 50% 55% OF THAT AMOUNT WOULD GO TO. I'M SORRY 45% AMOUNT WILL GO TO THOSE BY COUNTIES THAT DID THAT DID RECEIVE CORRECT ALLOCATIONS AND SIERRA MONIES FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. BUT WHICH IN FACT HAD THEIR ALLOCATIONS REDUCED BECAUSE THEY HAVE CITIES AND THEIR JURISDICTIONS ALSO QUALIFY FOR FEDERAL RELIEF. SO WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT. THOSE COUNTIES DIDN'T GET QUITE AS MUCH AS THEY WOULD OTHERWISE AS AN ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL FORMULAS BECAUSE THE FACT THAT THEY HAD CITIES IN A JURISDICTION IT ALSO INDEPENDENTLY QUALIFY FOR SIERRA. MONEY NUMBER POLICY PROVIDED FOR FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND I'M STATES EUROPE MONIES TO CITIES- THIS DOES EXCLUDE THOSE FIVE CITIES THAT DID RECEIVE DIRECT ALLOCATIONS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND OF THE- FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. 50% WOULD GO TO THOSE SEVEN CITIES WITH POPULATIONS BETWEEN AND THE MONEY WILL FLOW DIRECTLY TO THE CITIES. AND THEN THE OTHER 50% WILL GO TO THE CITY'S POPULATIONS UNDER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND. AND BEHIND GIVING- 50% TO SEVEN CITIES WITH POPULATIONS BETWEEN BECAUSE YOU MINISTRATION BELIEVES THEY HAVE. SOMEWHAT UNIQUE- SERVICE NEEDS SOME RELATION TO PARTICULARLY HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS. BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE A LARGE NUMBER ALMOST PEOPLE IN THEIR JURISDICTIONS AND- UNDER PREVIOUS MODELS SUCH AS THAT HE GOT LOCATIONS APPLICATIONS. OVER THE PAST YOU BUDGET YEARS. THOSE CITIES DID RECEIVE SOME ADDITIONAL ALLOTMENTS AN ACCOUNT. THERE NEEDS TO THE MONIES ARE BEING. ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS THEY CAN BE YOU OR- ACCORDING TO FEDERAL STATUTE AND ACCORDING TO OUR GUIDANCE THE STATE'S. RATIONS THEY CAN BE USED FOR ANY ALLOW PURPOSE UNDER THE FEDERAL STATUTES TO. AND FOR THE FACT THAT UNDER THE FEDERAL LAWS ALSO THIS MONEY HAS TO BE SPENT BY DECEMBER THIRTIETH. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. AND SO THE MONEY COULD NOT BE USED TO BACK FILL. USED FOR COVERT SERVICE RELATED PURPOSES AND SO WE BELIEVE THERE'S ENOUGH FLEXIBILITY AND THEREFORE CITIES FOR EXAMPLE TO BE ABLE TO USE THAT MONEY FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PUBLIC SAFETY AND FOR SERVING HOMELESS- EXPERIENCING. WITHIN THE PARAMETERS OF THE FEDERAL RULES AND REGULATIONS AND SIMILARLY WE BELIEVE THAT COUNTIES HELP. WHAT'S ABILITY TO USE THEIR ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLAR SHARE. BY KOBE RELATED SERVICE PUBLIC HEALTH PUBLIC SAFETY THINGS OF THAT NATURE SO THAT CONCLUDES THE UP ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR- ALLOCATION FROM THE STATE- RUN BY VIRTUALLY FUNDS TO THE LOCALS. I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OF MEMBERS MAY HAVE NOTS WORK THERE ARE NONE RIGHT NOW I'D BE HAPPY TO MOVE ON TO THE SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT RUN KEEP PEACE. AND SO I WILL GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON PROJECT RICKY. THE SIX SO MILLION AS PART OF THIS DISCUSSION IS THAT CORRECT. A YES THERE'S TWO ELEMENTS WERE PROVIDING ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN STATE ZERO MONEY TO CITIES AND COUNTIES CRIMINALS AND ADDITIONAL SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN STATE. MONEY THAT IS BEING PROVIDED TO FUND THE PROJECT REACHING PROPOSAL. PROJECT ROOM KEY ON AS A SERVER SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN STATE SIERRA MONIES AND THIS MONEY IS GONNA BE YEARS CHIU AT TEMPLE LEVERAGE ON THE SUCCESS OF THE CHEAP SO OR THROUGH- OUR EFFORTS TO PARTNER WITH LOCAL AGENCIES THE CITIES AND COUNTIES. ARE SOCIAL SERVICES IN TGS IN ORDER TO- SECURE HOTELS AND MOTELS OR- THOSE. PEOPLE ARE HOMELESS POPULATION. FOR MOST AT RISK OF KOBE. THE CURRENT ASSIST ON HEALTHCARE. IN KNOWS HER MORE. OR OLDER IN YOUR FIRST AND SO FAR THAT EFFORT HAS YIELDED. SIXTEEN THOUSAND CONTRACTING ROOMS AND SO WE'RE ATTEMPTING TO OF COURSE THAT IS ONLY TEMPORARY THIS IS TEMPORARY HOUSING AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO LEVERAGE OFF THE SUCCESS GETTING PEOPLE HOUSE TEMPORARILY AND TURN INTO A MORE PERMANENT SOURCE OF HOUSING THAT'S WHAT PROJECT SHE- YOU AT THE SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. SO MILLION DOLLARS WILL WILL. HOUSING YOU. AND A FOREIGN. YEAH THE LABEL SURPLUS IT- APPLICATIONS DOWN PROPOSALS FROM CITIES AND COUNTIES WHICH PARTICIPATE. AND THE MONEY WILL BE USED TO PURCHASE ON A- PURCHASE HOTELS MOTELS AND OTHER APPROPRIATE PROPERTIES THE PROPERTIES ARE PURCHASE DO NOT HAVE TO CURRENTLY BE USED- ART PROJECT BRING KICKING THE OTHER. USERS WELL. BUT THE IDEA IS TO TRY AND SECURE PERMANENT HOUSING FOR. INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE MOST RESTRAIN THIS TIME FROM CRISIS TO. GET OFF THE STREET STAND THROUGH PROVIDING THE CARE THEY NEED. SERVICE THEY NEED HOW IT'S GOING TO WORK THERE'S NOT A SECOND. MODEL YOUR STYLE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN EACH SEAT ONES APPLICATION AND PROPOSALS FROM CITIES AND COUNTIES. AND AGAIN GO AHEAD AND WEIGH THOSE- APPLICATIONS COASTAL BASED ON FRIDAY OF FACTORS TO INCLUDE ON. THE ABILITY TO EXTEND THESE SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDS BY THE DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY FEDERAL TO DATE ARE DISPATCHED THREE CUT OFF DATE.% AND ALSO THEY'RE GOING TO CONSIDER THE ABILITY OF ON THE CITY'S COUNTY IS AT THE TOP WEBER SEES MONIES TO SECURE PERMANENT- HOUSING. ALL THE WAY ABILITY OF THE CITY AND COUNTIES TO SUPPORT AT HEALTHY ON AN ONGOING BASIS BECAUSE AGAIN THESE ARE ONE TIME MONIES BUT- AFTER. THESE DISABILITIES TO HELP ONGOING NEEDS YOU CAN'T JUST STOP BOB YEAH BUT KEEP SERVICE NEEDS IN A VARIETY OF MAINTENANCE NEEDS SO THAT'S GONNA BE ANOTHER PRACTICE WAYS UTILITY TO. OUR LOCAL PARTNERS TO MAINTAIN THESE ON ONGOING BASIS STAND EIGHT CITIES GONNA CAST IS THAT'S POSSIBLE EXCEPT ON PROPOSALS FROM ALL LOCALS WHO WISH TO PARTICIPATE. AND. ADAM BACKWOODS- WHAT I HAVE TO SAY ON PROJECT RANKING AND BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS MEMBERS MAY HAVE EITHER BY ELEMENTS OF THIS PROPOSAL. VERY GOOD OF LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S. AND THAT'S WHAT I'M THAT'S WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE.HE IS A DEPARTURE FROM THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY PROPOSAL RELATED TO HOMELESSNESS I'M AS WELL AS WHAT THE STATE HAS DONE IN RECENT YEARS OF THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERS ALSO. THINK ABOUT WHETHER LOCALS ARE POSITIONED TO JIMMY. A LONG TERM PROVIDE THE SERVICES NECESSARY TO SUPPORT THE HOMELESS POPULATION AS WELL AS WEATHER LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO HOLD ON TO THIS PROPERTY INDIVIDUALS. PRESIDENT OF TIME. AND FINALLY WHETHER THIS IS THE BEST APPROACH TO ENSURE THE STATE CAN PRESERVE THE GAINS ITS MEETINGS. IN ADDITION IN ADDITION WE WOULD NOTE THAT THIS PROPOSAL DOES PROVIDE ADMINISTRATION SIGNIFICANT. DESTRUCTION OF THE LEGISLATURE WE WANT TO CONSIDER WHAT OPTION IT HAS RIGHT OVERSIGHT AND SURE SUCCESS. SHE THANK YOU. VERY MUCH COMMITTEE MEMBERS CENTER NIELSEN. I WAS VERY INTERESTED IN FAVOR REDUCE SUPPOSED TO THE GOVERNOR'S ORIGINAL PROPOSAL IN JANUARY OF BECAUSE IT. WHICH INCULCATING SOME NEW PARAMETERS I GUESS I WOULD CALL IT. AND THAT WAS ENSURING THAT THOSE WHO WERE BEING HOUSED AT HAD ACCESS TO TREATMENT AND- THE NEEDS THAT THEY MAY HAVE THAT WOULD BE EXTRAORDINARY AND WOULD INTERFERE WITH THEIR ABILITY TO GET BACK INTO THE WORK FORCE TO BECOME GAINFULLY PARTICIPATING IN SOCIETY IT WAS GOING TO FOCUS ON THAT. AND IN ADDITION TO THAT THE SUCH PLACEMENTS WE'RE GOING TO BE TRACKED AND MONITORED IF YOU WILL TO SEE IF WHAT WE'RE SPENDING THE MONEY ON. WAS IN FACT WORKING. NOW IS WE'RE PROCEEDING TO A BEEN A BRAVE NEW WORLD WHICH GREATLY CHANGED SINCE THAT TIME WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THE CONSIDERATION. OF TRACKING THE SUCCESSES IN AFRICA CITIES OF THE DIFFERENT TREATMENT- PLACEMENTS IN THE COMMUNITIES- AT TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THAT INDIVIDUAL POPULATION SO THAT THEY DON'T REMAIN DEPENDENT BUT THEY KIND OF. GET BACK INTO THE MAINSTREAM. AND I'M BUILDING ON THE MODEL THAT STARTED IN THE EIGHTIES WITH THE GAME PROGRAM GREATER AVENUES FOR INDEPENDENCE THAT THEN MORPHED INTO THE NINETIES I THINK IT WAS CAL WORKS THAT'S WHAT WE'RE CALLING IT NOW. SO IT IS NOT A PART OF THE- PROGRAM MAY BE ELIGIBLE FINANCE AND LEDGE ANALYST ON THIS ONE. ONE MIGHT BE HAPPY TO TAKE THE FIRST- FIRST A SHOT AT RESPONDING- YES OUR OUR ACCESS TO HOUSING SERVICES PROPOSAL THAT WASN'T PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THE STUDY SITE FOR THE OP THAT DID INCLUDE ON COMPONENTS OF- WRAPAROUND SERVICES. AND ONE OF THE LIMIT SO WE HAVE THIS FEDERAL CROWN OF I WAS REALLY FUN MONEY OVER PROVIDING FROM THE STATE TO THE LOCALS. OUT FEDERAL STATUTES REQUIRE THOSE MONIES BE EXTENDED BY DECEMBER. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT DOESN'T LEND ITSELF TO BEING USED FOR THOSE SORT OF WRAP AROUND SERVICES AND- SUPPORT HOUSING TYPE SERVICES. WHICH IS WHY WE'RE STILL TRYING TO LEVERAGE THOSE MONIES TO PROCURE. THE ROOM KEY. PROCURE PERMANENT SHELTER FOR THOSE HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS MOST AT RISK IN THIS TIME CRISIS. AND ALSO TO. GIVE A TOM TO THE MONEY THAT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FOR THE CITIES AND ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS THE COUNTIES TO PROVIDE THAT TO THEM SO THEY CAN USE. FOR KOBE RELATED PURPOSES AS WELL. THE ROLE OF THE ALLOWABLE USES. I'M HAPPY SAID ABOUT. THE PROJECT ROOM SHE ONE OF THE THAT THE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT WHAT WAY IS THE ABILITY OF THE BUT THE FUND RECIPIENTS TO SUPPORT THE HOUSING ON A PERMANENT BASIS AND TO PROVIDE SERVICES I'LL ALSO BE SOMETHING THAT COULD BE A CONSIDERATION SO- YES YOU ARE CORRECT IN THAT WE GET HELP TO DEPART SOMEWHAT FROM WHAT WAS OUR INITIAL PROPOSAL IN THE FALL BUT WE STILL THINK THAT THIS MAINTAINS. A LOT OF THE KEY ELEMENTS WITHIN THE PARAMETERS OF THE OF THE- MONEY THAT'S AVAILABLE. AND THEN. ONE MORE QUESTION RIGHT NOW MEDICARE. THE MAINTENANCE OF ACQUIRED OR LEASED PROPERTIES- WHAT ARE YOUR PROVISIONS FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF SAID PROPERTIES WHETHER THE STATE IS REQUIRED AT OR IS LEASING IT. YES THE MAINTENANCE THIS IS A KNOWN THAT'S UNKNOWN FACTOR THAT THE MONEY TO PURCHASE OF SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS LACKEY MAINTAINS AND SO THAT'S WHY EACH CD WORLD CONSIDERS CARTER APPLICATION PROCESS THE ABILITY OF THOSE. LOCALS TO RECEIVE THAT MONEY TO PURCHASE COPIES ON A PERMANENT BASIS. TO MAINTAIN THOSE PROPERTIES AS WELL. UNFORTUNATELY THE FEDERAL MONEY ITSELF COULD NOT BE USED FOR THOSE MAINTENANCE PURPOSES BECAUSE IT SUCKS. IT'S THE EXPENDITURE DEEP DEADLINE OF DECEMBER. AND WELL MAYBE THIS FOLLOW THIS WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE REPORTED HOMELESS POPULATION DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU HAVE NOW SECURED HOUSING ACCOMMODATIONS FOR. MOTEL THROUGH HOTELS OR WHATEVER SURE THROUGH THE- IN THE EFFORTS OF- DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES IN TGS WORKING WITH THEM CITIES AND COUNTIES- CROXLEY SIXTEEN THOUSAND CONTRACTED ROOMS HAVE BEEN SECURED- WE DO OF KNOWLEDGE- APPROXIMATELY EIGHT THOUSAND THOSE ARE STILL RIGHT NOW SO THEY'RE NOT ALL BUILD BUT- HAVING SAID THAT OUT. THE EATING TGS NOVEL CARTER'S DONE A VERY GOOD JOB AND WORKING IT BECAUSE WE THIS ONLY CAME UP TWO MONTHS AGO IN TWO MONTHS WE'VE ONLY DONE A LOT TO- TO SECURE ROOMS AND TO BEGIN FLOWING- RESIDENTS IN THOSE ROOMS SO THAT WE REALIZE IT'S AN ONGOING PROCESS. YEAH JUST KEEPING UP WITH THE BEST A KIANA AND BROKEN HOLES FROM STILL SOON. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANKS VERY MUCH SENATOR. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- FIRST ON THE- THE BROADER ISSUE- YOU MENTIONED THAT THE FUNDING DOES NOT- IS NOT LIMITED TO HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS SIDE I HAVE A REAL CONCERN ABOUT THAT BECAUSE- OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND I'VE ONLY BEEN TO MY SECOND YEAR HERE BUT I KNOW THAT HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS IS SUCH OF CRISIS. AT SUCH A CRISIS LEVEL AND THERE'S SUCH ENORMOUS NEED WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY VERY HARD IN THE SENATE- UNDER THE PRO TEM'S LEADERSHIP- TO CONTINUE ON AND BUILD AND REALLY- IMPLEMENT SOME SERIOUS FOCUSED STRATEGIC POLICIES THAT GET US YOU KNOW THAT HELP US TO MAKE PROGRESS HERE WE HAVE THE OF A WHAT IS IT A MILLION AND A HALF OF MORE OR LESS UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING THERE ARE NEEDED IN THE STATE. I LIKE TO KNOW WHY WOULD WE NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS FUNDING. TO ADD TO THE TOOLS OF POLICIES ADD TO THAT FUNDING SO THAT IT JUST DOESN'T GET SCATTERED I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE ENORMOUS NEEDS RIGHT NOW BUT- WHY NOT. WHY GIVE SO MUCH FLEXIBILITY TO BE USED OTHERWISE RATHER THAN LIMITING THAT TO HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS. YES SENATOR WE HAVE THE- APPROXIMATELY TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING HERE IN SIERRA MONEY STATES PROVIDING TO LOCALS- SIX HUNDRED MILLION WILL RIGHT OFF THE TOP BE USED TO SERVE ON. HOMELESS PERSONS. JEFF RANKING. AND THEN- BUT THE FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S WILLING TO CITIES AND COUNTIES- OUR EXPECTATION IS THAT CITIES. WILL BE WORKING BUT THERE ARE CONTINUOUS CARE NURSE COUNTIES TO GO AHEAD AND- REX ANY MONIES THAT ARE USED THE SERVER BUT ALMOST COMMUNITIES ON A WAY THAT COORDINATES WITH ONGOING EFFORTS AND SERVICES. THAT OUR EXPECTATION THAT THAT. SOME OF THAT MONEY I CAN'T PUT A DOLLAR AMOUNT ON IT BUT SOME OF THAT MONEY WILL ALSO BE USED TO SERVE THE HOMELESS- INDIVIDUALS. AND AS FAR AS THE COUNTY MONEY GOES THE ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS- THERE'S NOT A STRICT REQUIREMENT THAT MONEY BE USED TO ANSWER- THE HOME ALMOST POPULATION BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT. WITH THE- THE CURRENT CRISIS AND- THE MANY REVENUE LOSSES THAT COUNTIES AND CITIES AND- IN ADDITION A LARGE SERVICE LOADS. BY YOU SOME U. PEOPLE WE RECOGNIZE THAT. FLEXIBILITY TO GO AHEAD AND USE THAT MONEY FOR OTHER PURPOSES AS WELL HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. WE RELATED THINGS ON THE- FEDERAL LAW SO WE'RE SOME FLEXIBILITY. WELL I WOULD CONTINUE TO INSIST- AND URGE YOU TO- CHANGE THAT AND MAKE IT MORE OF A FOCUS WE IT BEFORE THIS COURT PANDEMIC. HOUSING WAS NOT GETTING BUILT. ON AND THEN WE STARTED MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND IT'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER REASON WHY CITIES OR COUNTIES DON'T USE THE FUNDING FOR HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS SO I THINK UNLESS WE HAVE A COORDINATED POLICY IN FUNDING STRATEGY IT'S GONNA IT'S GONNA SLIP AWAY AND IT'S GOING TO GO BACKWARDS- I HAVE A SPECIFIC ONE ABOUT THE ROOM KEY UP IN LOS ANGELES I THINK RIGHT NOW. IT SERVING ABOUT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED- INDIVIDUALS- AND MAYBE SOME MORE SITES COMING AND SO MY CONCERN IS. WHAT'S THE TRANSITION PLAN. FOR THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOW IN THAT- IN THOSE ROOMS IN THAT KIND OF HOUSING- OF. YOU KNOW FOR LEAVING YOU KNOW AND THE TRANSITION. IT WAS THIS JUST A QUICK YOU KNOW LET'S GET THEM OUT BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC GET THEM OFF THE STREETS IF IT DOESN'T HAVE YOU KNOW REAL ACCESS TO JOB TRAINING EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES- WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT OTHER THINGS IT SEEMS TO ME THAT JUST GONNA WRITE BACK QUICKLY GET ON THE STREETS AND WE'RE WE'RE BACK ROW. MAYBE EVEN WORSE OFF THAN WHERE WE STARTED SO WHAT'S THE TRANSITION PLAN. THE TRANSITION PLAN IS THAT- WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT YOU KNOW THAT IS. SHORT TERM HOUSING RIGHT NOW THE SECURE NAY SO TELLS IN MOTELS. BUT THE GUIDING PRINCIPLE BEHIND PROJECT ROOMS IN THE SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ALL OVER EXISTS TO ATTEMPT TO SECURE AS MANY OF THOSE PROPERTIES. ALL FOUR MINUTE BASIS SO THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS FOR BEING HOUSE AND THERE ARE. TEMPORARILY RIGHT NOW. SHOULD HAVE A PERMANENT OPPORTUNITY FOR HOUSING IN THOSE FACILITIES OR OTHER SIMILARLY SITUATED FACILITIES. AND SO THAT'S GOING TO BE THAT'S THE PRINCIPLE BEHIND PROJECT ROOM KEY IN THIS PART OF THE- COST US. WE'RE GONNA BUT TEMPERATURES. WELL THE PROJECT PROPERTY FUND WITH MONIES THAT. THAT THEY HAVE A VIABLE PLAN GOING FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE THIS FACILITIES BECAUSE WE DO RECOGNIZE THIS IS ONE PINE MONEY IT'S EASY TO PURCHASE THE PROPERTY. CHIEF OPERATIONS. THING SO THAT'S GOING TO BE A FACTOR AS WELL. AND THEN FINALLY- MENTIONED. CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN NINETY. IN THIS ON THE USE OF THAT WHAT IS. WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS A PROPOSAL THAT. THAT THAT WOULD BE INCLUDED IN THERE OF YOU KNOW PRETTY MUCH NO NOTICE- NO LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL THAT YOU WOULD THINK THAT OF CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN NINETY IS NEEDED THANK GETS NEEDED BECAUSE OF THE IMMEDIACY OF CRISIS- WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO GET THIS MONEY OUT TO- MORE LOCAL CORPORATE. ORDERS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE STE. RIGHT SERVICES TO THESE PEOPLE ARE MOST IN NEED AND- THAT STEPS THE GUIDING PRINCIPLE BEHIND BEING ELEVEN NINETY EIGHT AND YOU THINK THAT NOT HAVING LEGISLATIVE. OVERSIGHT OR HAVING LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT WOULD STOP YOU FROM GETTING THOSE FUNDINGS ON. WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT WOULD STOP US FROM GETTING THE MONEY OUT BUT WE BELIEVE THAT WE WANT TO FOR THE MANY OUT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND I AM NOT IN A POSITION TO MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS- ON BEHALF OF THE ADMINISTRATION BUT I THINK THAT. I DO THINK THAT WE WOULD CERTAINLY. BUT AT LEAST. TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE WITH ON THE LEGISLATURE HOW THE MONEY IS BEING USED IN TWO OR SHARE INFORMATION REGARDING HOW- HOW THE MONEY'S GOING OUT AND IS USING AT BUT SENATE SHE- AND JUST AND MADAM CHAIR I THINK THAT'S A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE AND I FOR ONE. WOULD URGE THAT- BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE OF NOT JUST A NOT EVEN JUST A NOTICE WE NEED MORE SERIOUS- INVOLVEMENT AN ENGAGEMENT ANDS AND SUPPORT FOR MAYBE NOT SUPPORT FROM THE LEGISLATION SO. THAT'S THAT'S MY LAST COMMENT ON THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SENATOR DR SO I I'LL START ON THAT ON THAT PARTICULAR NOTE IN AND SAY I APPRECIATE THE INTERESTING GETTING THEM OUT MONEY OUT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE- BUT THE AYE AYE AYE I SECOND THE CONCERNED THAT SENATOR DRAWS- HAS WHICH WHICH IS THAT THAT- THE LEGISLATURE IT THERE IS A ROLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE IN IN THIS DISCUSSION AND- WILL HAVE. THIS ISSUE COME UP A NUMBER OF OTHER ON A NUMBER OF OTHER ITEMS AND I THINK WE CAN PROBABLY SAY DITTO FOR THOSE AS WELL- IT AT THE ELEVEN IDEA TO BE USED VERY. VERY STRATEGICALLY AND- AND- I'LL TELL YOU ONE OF THE REASONS I'M CONCERNED IS- IN MY DISTRICT I HAVE FOR COMMUNITIES. FOR CITIES THAT ARE OVER FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IT THEN THERE FROM 400-002-0060 THOUSAND PEOPLE SO THEY GOT NO DIRECT. FUNDS FROM THE CARE ACT- IT THAT THE CITY'S NEEDED TO BE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ARE LARGER. AND SO MOST OF THE THIS THE CITIES AND I'VE GOT TWENTY EIGHT CITIES. ARE A LOT SMALLER THERE FROM THIRTY THOUSAND TO- SEVENTEEN HUNDRED AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT- THERE. THOSE ARE THE CITIES AND I'VE HEARD FROM ALL OF THE MAYORS THAT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY'VE HAD THE IN AN IMPACT IN THE COMMUNITY. AND THEY'RE GETTING NO RELIEF AND NO NO RESOURCES AND THEY'RE CONCERNED AT THAT THERE ARE- MAJORITY FARM WORKER COMMUNITIES WITH THEM- BLUE COLLAR WORKERS AND SO THEY THEY JUST DON'T HAVE A LOT OF REVENUES AND YET THIRD THEY'VE HAD TO MAKE SOME- SOME SIGNIFICANT CHANGES AND SOME- THEY'VE HAD TO EXPEND FUNDS BECAUSE OF THIS VIRUS AND SO- THE- THE IDEA OF HAVING TO GO THROUGH THE COUNTY HAS THEM CONCERNED BECAUSE MOST OF THEM FILL IT DON'T GET NO MONEY FROM THE COUNTIES AND I HAVE SIX COUNTIES. IN IN IN THE- THE DISTRICT AND SO ALL OF THEM ARE SAYING THE SAME THINGS WHICH IS THAT- IF THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO GET MONEY DIRECTLY FROM THE STATE THAT THAT'S THE WAY THEY'D LIKE TO RECEIVE IT RATHER THAN GOING THROUGH THIS. THROUGH THE COUNTY'S NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO IS MANY OF THEM WILL NEED TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT KINDS OF THINGS THEY CAN USE THEM FOR SO THAT THEY DON'T END UP GETTING THEMSELVES IN TROUBLE SO TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WOULD BE- A GOOD THING AS WELL EVEN IF IT'S JUST A LIST OF THE KINDS OF THINGS. WE CAN USE IT FOR- LIKE MASKS AND PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND- DEVICES THEY'VE HAD TO INSTALL LIKE THESE KIND OF PLEXIGLAS THOSE KINDS OF THINGS- SO I RECOMMEND THAT WE LOOK AT- NOT ALLOCATING THE FUNDS THROUGH THE COUNTIES THEY'RE LOCATED. ON THAT. CAN BE DONE BY BY POPULATION WE DO IT ALL THE TIME- SO THAT THAT'S- IN THE ISSUE THAT CAN. TURN THE PRICE ROOM KEY I'M I THINK IT'S A BIT END OF A WAY TO. BUY HOUSE HOMELESS BECAUSE WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT WE HAVE HOUSING UNITS AND SO IF YOU CAN USE THING THAT EXISTS THAT GREAT A GREAT IDEA BUT IF YOU CAN AT. HAVE AND THE GRANT THEM SET UP THROUGH EIGHT I'LL BE REAL FRANK WITH YOU PROBABLY MOST OF THE COMMUNITIES. IN MY IN MY DISTRICT WANT WON'T HAVE THAT UP. TO APPLY FOR IT THERE. THERE JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY'RE GONNA. COULD EXIST OVER THE THROUGH THEIR OWN BUDGET PROCESS- THEY'RE MAKING SOME TOUGH DECISIONS AND SO- I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FUNDS THAT ARE DISTRIBUTED TO PURCHASE HOTELS OR MOTELS. IS EQUALLY SPENT ALL OVER THE STATE AND THAT IT DOESN'T END UP GOING TO ONE COMMUNITY WHO'S BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BE ABLE TO. TO THE TWIST THE ARMS OF HOTEL OWNERS TO BE ABLE TO BUY BY THE HOTEL SO- THAT HAVE BEEN HAVING HIS AND MY GUESS IS IN ADDITION IS THAT THE FACILITIES ARE GOING TO BE THE ONES THAT ARE. STARTING TO FALL FALL DOWN BECAUSE YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO SELL YOUR HOTEL AND MOTEL AND I'M THINKING OR MOTELS- IF IT'S FALLING APART SO- LONG TERM STRATEGY FOR HOW TO KEEP THAT FACILITY GOING IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT SO. THIS THIS IS ONE CAN GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT OF HEARTBURN I GET WE NEED TO SPEND THE MONEY TO. BUY A THE ENDOF THE YEAR- AND- BUT I ALSO THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO BE INVOLVED IN IN SOME OF THESE DECISIONS SELF THIS IS A HOLD WHY DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS I. AT THIS POINT BUT I THINK IT WAS A REALLY GOOD DISCUSSION IN MY QUESTIONS GOT ANSWERED AT CENTER NIELSEN. LET ME JUST INTERJECT ONE MORE SPECIFIC THAT CERTAINLY RELATES TO THE AREAS OF INTEREST TO THE CHAIR AND MYSELF AND THAT WOULD BE FARM WORKER HOUSING AT ANY. PARTICULAR FOCUS ON FARM WORKER HOUSING. I'M NOT SERVICES THAT- QUESTION- FARM WORKER HOUSING- TAKE TO THE EXTENT THAT ALEX- THEY WERE THERE ARE. HOTELS MOTELS OTHER SIMILAR PROPERTIES THAT CAN HELL'S. LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE IN THE ADEQUATE SAFE ENVIRONMENT AND OUT TO BE LOCATED IN A RURAL COMMUNITY AND CERTAINLY THAT COULD BE ON THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED AS PART OF PROPOSITION PROP- PROJECT ROOM HE IS WELL. THAT'S IMPORTANT POINT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION CENTER NIELSEN. THAT CONCLUDES OUR ITEM NUMBER TWENTY SEVEN WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY EIGHT WHICH IS THE NATIONAL MORTGAGE SETTLEMENT. AND WILL- TURN IT OVER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I'M GONNA DROP OFF BUT ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES TAKE OVER VERY GOOD THANK YOU MISTER HILL. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS DID YOU CRUZ DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE RELIEF TO RENTERS AND HOMEOWNERS. THIS CALL AND THEN THEY- ON THE CALL. EACH OTHER. AND THE ONE MILLION SETTLEMENT FUNDS TO AVOID AVAILABLE FOR CLOSURES. JUST LOOK ON THIS ALLOCATE THREE HUNDRED MILLION BECOME HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY ON HOUSING COUNSELING SERVICES AND MORTGAGE ASSISTANCE. ASIAN OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR QUALIFIED SCHOOLS YOU MORTGAGE SERVICE PROVIDERS. I DON'T NAY KELLY TO BEAT YOU- PARTNERS IN THE PAST HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT. PLANS FOR A SIMILAR SERVICE IN RESPONSE THE GREAT RECESSION ANY TENNIS PROVIDE OF THIS NINETY NINE THE FIRST FIFTY TO SEVENTY FIVE MILLION HOUSING SERVICES INCREASED AWARENESS OF THE BILL OF RESOURCES AND END USER MEANING OR THE MORTGAGE. THE REMAINING THIRTY ONE MILLION WILL BE ALLOCATED TO THE JUDICIAL BRANCH TO. WRESTLE PEOPLE SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOR HOMEOWNERS AND RENTERS BUT I'M HAPPY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OHIO. ONCE AGAIN NOTED AS WELL AS WITH THE ALEJO- THE ASSOCIATE GENERAL DOES WHAT DETAILS ABOUT HELP SOMEONE FUNDS WILL BE USED TO. ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT ACTIVITIES WILL BE FUNDED AND WHO WILL BE A BENEFICIARY OF THOSE SERVICES.% AS WELL AS WHAT OVERSIGHT IS NECESSARY I TO OVERSEE CALTRANS WORK IN THE SPACE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- COMMITTEE MEMBERS YES SENATOR OZ OF JUST ONE A DIGITAL WITH THE- THE COMMENTS BY THE LA THIS IS. THIS IS REALLY URGENT PAINT YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE FACING ENORMOUS PRESSURES AND I REALLY THINK THAT- WELL I PLUG THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY GOING TO MORTGAGE ASSISTANCE AND- PAID FOR ANDERSON AND HOMEOWNERS WE NEED MORE- SPECIFIC INFORMATION AND- I WOULD REALLY URGE ALSO- PUTTING MORE INTO AID FOR RENTERS AND HOMEOWNERS OFFERED BLADE- THAN WHAT IS UP WITH THEIR THEIR THE I THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE FACING AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF. A POTENTIAL EVICTIONS BOB VERY QUICKLY AFTER THE TWO THREE MONTHS OF THE EMERGENCY ARE OVER THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. YES SENATOR NIELSEN ANOTHER POINT OF INQUIRY IT IS IT'S BEEN BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION. AND OF COURSE THIS IS BEING HELD OPEN SO WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT. BUT AS FAR AS GETTING THE MORTGAGE ASSISTANCE MONEY OUT TO DISTRESSED HOMEOWNERS IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED TO ME THAT. THE HOUSING FINANCE AUTHORITY IS A BIT MORE NIMBLE OR QUICK TO MOVE AGENCY AND HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT IS OF ANY CONSIDERATION TO RE DIRECT THAT RESPONSIBILITY A LITTLE BIT FOR GETTING MONEY OUT MORE EXPEDITIOUSLY. IT IT IS. THAT'S A BIG JUMP QUESTION I SUPPOSE I SHOULD TO ASK FINANCE THAT QUESTION. IN. IT'S CAN SOMEBODY FROM ABOVE FROM FINANCE I BELIEVE THAT THE REPORT SAYS THAT IT IS THAT KELLY CHIU FADED THAT WOULD BE IN CHARGE OF ALLOCATING THE RESOURCES AND YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THEY'VE THEY'VE DEVELOPED A FIRST TIME HOME BUYER BUYER PROGRAM IT AS WELL AS A ROUTE AT AN ASSISTANT MORTGAGE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. THAT. SO MY AT MY BIG CONCERN THAT YOU KNOW WHAT TIMES IT'S AND IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE- THIS IS A- THIS IS MONEY THAT WAS- WAS PAID. DURING THE LAST DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY BECAUSE OF THE MORTGAGE MELTDOWN THAT THAT OCCURRED BECAUSE OF FRAUD. BY THE MORTGAGE- INDUSTRY AND SO YOU KNOW AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR I WAS REALLY. FOCUSED ON. BECAUSE SO MANY OF THE HOMEOWNERS- WERE BLUE COLLAR WORKERS THAT HAD BOUGHT THEIR HOME FOR THE FIRST TIME- IDENTIFYING A WAY TO GET. THIS MONEY TO CAL HFA AND THEN TO HAVE THEM- I CREATE A FIRST FIRST TIME HOMEBUYERS PROGRAM FOR THOSE PEOPLE THAT LOST THEIR HOUSES. SO THAT THEY COULD ENTER THE THAT THE MARKET AGAIN- AND- THE DIFFERENCE THAT. THREE OR FOUR MONTHS MAKES IS THAT DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE JUST NOT IN A POSITION TO BE ABLE TO BUY A HOUSE GIVEN THE DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY. SO I'M REALLY CONCERNED WITH THIS BEING IS USED AS WISELY AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE I AGREE WITH WITH MY COLLEAGUES HERE THAT- THE DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY IS GOING TO PUT A LOT OF PEOPLE AT RISK. AND AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS WHICH IS WHY THE YOU KNOW HAVING. HAVING UNITS TO PUT PEOPLE INTO BECOMES VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND ALSO AT RISK OF LOSING THEIR HOMES AND SO. ON WE'RE GONNA NEED A- SOME SOME. IT KELLY CHIPPY IS I THINK A REALLY GOOD ENTITY. TO REALLY FOCUS ON GETTING THE MORTGAGE MORTGAGE LENDERS TOGETHER. AND COMING UP WITH A WAY TO BE ABLE TO. HELP PEOPLE OUT SO THAT THEY DON'T LOSE OUR HOME SO. THIS IS THIS IS A HOLD OPEN I THINK IT'S WORTH MORE DISCUSSION AND I APPRECIATE THE- THE INTERESTING GETTING THE MONEY OUT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND NOT HAVING IT SIT IN THE TRUST FUND ANYMORE. SO WE'LL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY NINE WHICH IS THE HOUSING REVERSION. AND WILL TURN IT OVER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. IRAN. WELL GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN ABOUT INTERNET FOR NEW MEMBERS DAY CRUISE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE GIVEN THE NEW AND UNFORESEEN ECONOMIC VALUE. THE STATE DISTRIBUTED SOLUTIONS SUPPORT THE GENERAL FUND MIGHT WHILE MINIMIZING THE IMPACT OF THE STATE'S HOUSING PROGRAM. PROPOSES TO OUR VERSIONS TOTALING MORE FIFTY NINE OF PREVIOUSLY APPROPRIATED BUT UNDERUSED FEINSTEIN GENERAL FUND INVESTMENTS. INCLUDING TWENTY MILLION. HOUSING AND SHE NEEDED ALL MEN'S AND GO INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS PROGRAM IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND TWENTY. THE NINE COLLEGE BASED MAKES ANGLE PROGRAM. TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY THREE. ORGANS ARMORED IMPORTANT TO KNOW TO LOOK TO OPERATE WITH FUNDING FROM ONE AND ANNUAL ASKING TO REVENUES RESPECTIVELY CONTINUE ALL STRING. SECTION IN THE STATE WHATEVER HAVE YOU TAKE ANY. THE OHIO. THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING WITH THE LA JOH HOMELESSNESS IS AN AREA OF THE BUDGET WHERE THE LEGISLATURE HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT ONE TIME GENERAL ON WHICH YOU SHOULD. WEAR PORTIONS OF THE FUNDING HAS NOT BEEN SPENT AND AS A RESULT IS AVAILABLE. TO HELP ADDRESS THE GENERAL FUND BUDGET PROBLEMS YOU STACEY. EXPENSE OF FULLY ACHIEVING THE OBJECTIVES LEGISLATURE INTENDED WHEN AUTHORIZED. THOSE AUGMENTATIONS AND SO I CAN MANY OTHER AREAS OF THE BUDGET THE LOGISTICS WILL HAVE TO WAIT TO TREAT. OUR SUPPORTING ADDITIONAL HOUSING DEVELOPMENT AND ADDRESSING THE STATE'S. DECISIONS TO MAKE. MUCH MANY MEMBERS FENNER DRIVES OF. YES HIS OUR OUR FAVORITE SUBJECT MEMOREX EVERYDAY HAVING WORKED WITH SENATOR QUALITY OF IDEA TO ON THIS IN IN IN THE SENATE. THIS IS THE FUNDING OBVIOUSLY THAT WAS ALREADY AUTHORIZED AND YOU KNOW AS FAR AS I SEE IT IN ON THE MOVE IS THE FUNDING THAT WAS. GETTING USED TO STARTING TO GET USED MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AS I FOR REPEAT EVERYTHING I SAID EARLIER IT IS WE'VE GOT TO HAVE THE COMBINATION OF THESE POLICIES WITH FUNDING- IT IS THE LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY IT IS A CALIFORNIA PRIORITY OF CALIFORNIA PRIORITY ALWAYS COMES UP AS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE- OF A HOUSING OF COURSES CONNECTED ESPECIALLY TO HOMELESSNESS SO. I YOU KNOW THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE BEEN GRAPPLING WITH IS WERE WE BUILDING FOR HOME OR WE BUILDING WE KNOW WE NEED IT FOR LITTLE AWE LOW INCOME VERY LOW INCOME- I JUST DON'T SEE HOW WE CAN. DE DETRACT FROM THAT DEVIATE FROM THAT INSTEAD OF MOVING FOR WE CAN'T LOSE THAT PARTICULAR MOMENTUM SO. OBVIOUSLY IT'S GOT TO BE OTHER WAYS OF ALL PHILLY THE NEEDS OF THE OF THEGENERAL FUND AND OUR BUDGET BUT- I JUST THINK WE SHOULD NOT GO BACKWARDS ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU MANAGING. THIRTY NIELSEN ANY QUESTIONS CONCERNING THIS ITEM. SO I WON A SECOND WHAT THE SENATOR DR SO SAD OUR MOVE BEEN WORKING REALLY HARD ON HOUSING PACKAGE IN PART OF THAT PACKAGE- IS LOOKING AT WAYS TO BE ABLE TO DO MORE. UP IN OUR OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES IT TAKES MONEY TAKES RESOURCES AND UP THE PIECE THAT'S A LITTLE BIT TROUBLING IS THE INFO INFRASTRUCTURE PIECE BECAUSE- WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE COMPLICATED TO DO INFILL- IT'S BETTER. IT'S BETTER FOR THE COMMUNITY AND IT'S BETTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT BUT- SOMETIMES INFRASTRUCTURE IS OLD IS OLD AND NEEDS NEEDS REPAIRS AND TO HAVE ONE PROJECT HAVE TO PICK THAT IT BECOMES VERY COST. COST AT A PROHIBITIVE AND SO- I HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THIS IS A HOLD OPEN AND I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN NOW. MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS- AND THIS IS NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT. THAT HAS ME A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED AS AS AS A REVERSION- IT MEANS WE DON'T GET THE MONEY BACK SO IF THERE'S NO MORE COMMENTS ON THIS ONE I'LL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ITEM. GEN THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR TESTIMONY ARE MOVING ON TO ITEM NUMBER ISSUE NUMBER THIRTY WHICH IS THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE CLEAN UP. AND WILL I TURN IT OVER TO. TO THE- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AN INMATE I'M SURE NUMBERS DINNER CRUISE APARTMENT OF FINANCE.

IT'S SPECIFIED STATE HOUSING FROM BEING UTILIZED FOR CONSTRUCTION- OF HOUSING FOR FEDERAL A STRAY WORKERS. UNFORTUNATELY EXISTING LANGUAGE CAN BE CONSTRUED BROADLY AN ANCHOR SIGNIFICANT STATE COSTS AND EXPOSE THE STATE SIGNIFICANT LEGAL EXPOSURE SPECIFIED THIS PROGRAM AT THE RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. FIND THE DEFINITION OF AGRICULTURE EMPLOYED HOUSING. EASY TO IMPLEMENT HELP YOU BUY LINES AND FORCE YOUR ARMS AND THEN YOU'RE STREAMLINING PROGRAM MAKES CONFORMING CHANGES ARE PROBLEMATIC. THIS MORNING I GIVEN THAT THIS PRESSURES AND STAYING SAYS THIS TRAILER BILL IS NECESSARY TO SAVE THE STATE TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE IT IS NOT CURRENTLY IN THE BUDGET IN NINE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND ONGOING. IN WHATEVER HAVE YOU TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. PART OF THE LA. THE OTHER COMMENTS TO ADD ON THIS PROPOSAL BUT HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS VERY GOOD INDIA COMMENTS OR CONCERNS CENTER DRIVES OF YES. AS SOME FINANCE SAID THERE'S CURRENTLY PROBATION ON STATE FUNDING FOR H. TWO EIGHT OF WORKER HOUSING- CONCERNED CONCERNED- JUST FAST FORWARD CONCERNED THAT THE CHANGES PROPOSED IN THE TRAILER BILL TO ADD THE TERM UNITS MIGHT ERODE THE INTENT OF EXISTING LAW. THAT NO STATE FUNDING CAN BE USED FOR HOUSING THAT HOUSES H. TWO EIGHT EMPLOYEES- AND THAT COULD INCLUDE HOUSING THAT HAS SOME AGE TO A HOUSING UNITS AND SOME NON HA HOUSING UNITS. OR BERWICK STYLE HOUSING OR MOBILE HOME PARK HOUSING SO I'D URGE WE- KEEP THIS OPEN CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT. THIRTY NIELSEN. JUST TO FOLLOW ON THAT PARTICULAR POINT I UNDERSTAND THAT THE- ADMINISTRATION WAS GOING TO DO SOME TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IT MAY BE FORTHCOMING STREAMLINING THE APPROVAL PROCESS AND- THAT THAT WOULD CLARIFY THE SHE H. CD'S REGULATORY AUTHORITIES. A LITTLE BIT AND PROCEDURES THE DEPARTMENT SO WE CAN MAYBE MOVE THINGS MORE QUICKLY IS THERE MERIT TO THAT OBSERVATION THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE WORKING ON STREAMLINING. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ONE OF MINE AND THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING AT THIS TIME. OKAY WELL IT THIS IS TO REMAIN OPEN SPOT SO ANY INFORMATION THAT YOU COULD GET TO US ABOUT WHAT THE INTENTION IS OUT WOULD BE. GREATLY APPRECIATED. CONCERNED ABOUT EXACTLY HOW THIS GETS PROCESSED. SO THAT CONCLUDES OUR- PART B. HOW ON HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS PART OF THE AGENDA. SO WE'LL MOVE ON TO PART C. WHICH IS OTHER STATE ADMINISTRATION. AND IF WE'RE GONNA DO A SWITCH. OKAY NO SWITCH SO NO NEED BETWEEN WE JUST NEED TO. GET TO THE PAPERS. OKAY. THE PEOPLE ON THE PHONE FOR THEIR PATIENCE. OKAY. SIR MY CORRECT THAT THE NEXT ITEM IS ISSUE- OR NINETY SIX K. VERY GOOD ITEM FOR DISCUSSION ISSUE ONE NINETY SIX WHICH IS THE CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS EMERGENCY SUPPORT FUNCTION SEVENTEEN AND THE AMERICORPS FUNDING STRATEGY AND WILL TURN IT OVER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT- JOSH FREDDIE THIS CHEAP SERVERS OFFICER FOR CALIFORNIA FOR CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEER SHOULD BE ON STANDBY LIKE TO TURN THIS OVER HIM VERY UNLIKELY TO DO IS IT'S JUST YOU. VERY GOOD. WELCOME YOU SENATOR MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU SENATORS FOR HAVING US TODAY OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS THE E. S. F. SEVENTEEN ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES THAT HAVE BEEN LED BY CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS HAVE CRITICAL SUPPORT OUR MOST VULNERABLE AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES INCLUDING SUPPORT FOR OUR OPERATIONAL CAPACITY OF OUR FOOD BANKS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE FIRST SHELTER PLACE ANNOUNCED BY GOVERNOR NEWS AND CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS AND I WERE TASKED TO LEAD THE U. S. SEVENTEEN FOR TASK FORCE TO ENSURE THE OPERATIONAL SUSTAINABILITY IN CONTINUITY OF FOOD BANKS ACROSS THE STATE AND WITH THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC THE FOOD BANK SAW IN MANY PLACES DROP OF UP 270% OF THE POINTS YEARS THEY RELY ON TO OPERATE IN THIS DUE LARGELY. THEIR FOR OLDER AND HIGHER RISK FOR KOBE NINETEEN SO QUICKLY WE DEPLOYED THE CALIFORNIA GUARD THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS AND AMERICA AS WELL AS SEVERAL OTHER VOLUNTEER GROUPS PROVIDE EMERGENCY SUPPORT SINCE THEN WE HAVE SUPPORTED THIRTY FIVE BANKS IN TWENTY SEVEN COUNTIES AND THAT THESE FOOD BANKS WE HAVE HELP PROVIDES THIRTY TWO MILLION MEALS SINCE KOBE NINETEEN BEGAN. TO DATE THE CALIFORNIA GUARD CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS AMERICORPS AND THE CALIFORNIANS FOR ALL SERVICE INITIATIVE HAS SUPPORTED OUR FOOD BANKS WITH OVER A HUNDRED AND. SIXTY THOUSAND PERSONNEL HOURS. SO NOW IS THE CALIFORNIA GUARD BEGINS TO DRIVE DOWN ON THIS MISSION AT THE FOOD BANKS. WE NEED TO TRANSITION TO A LONGER TERM VOLUNTEER FORCE TO SUSTAIN OPERATIONS. AND TO ACCOMPLISH THIS WE WILL BE RELYINGON CALIFORNIANS FOR ALL WHICH IS RUN BY CALIFORNIA'S VOLUNTEERS. AS WELL AS AMERICORPS SERVICE MEMBERS AND TO GIVE A SENSE OF SCALE WE ARE EXPECTING TO NEED TO PROVIDE OVER THIRTY THOUSAND VOLUNTEERS. JUST SUPPORT FOOD BANKS IN CALIFORNIA AND WE DON'T SEE THE DEMAND DIMINISHING ANYTIME SOON. IN FACT MANY FOOD BANKS HAVE SEEN A 100% INCREASE IN DEMAND AND THE PROJECTIONS SHOW THAT THESE NUMBERS WILL CONTINUE AT LEAST. THROUGH THE END OF THE YEAR. AMERICORPS PROGRAMS THAT WE RUN HAVE ALSO PLAYED A CRITICAL ROLE IN RESPONSE TO COPE IN NINETEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. THIS STATE SUPPORTED AMERICORPS PROGRAMS ARE SUPPORTING CRITICAL COVERT NINETEEN EFFORTS SUCH AS THE FOOD BANKS WE JUST DISCUSSED. AS WELL AS OTHER DISASTER RECOVERY MISSIONS LIKE THE CAMPFIRE RECOVERY IN PARADISE WHERE WE ARE MAKING A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT TO CREATE AND SUPPORT A LARGE PROGRAM FOR CASE WORKERS FOR CAMPFIRE VICTIMS. IN MOVING FORWARD THE AMERICORPS MEMBERS WILL CONTINUE TO BE INSTRUMENTAL IN MEETING EMERGENCY COMMUNITY NEEDS AS RECOVER AND REBUILD FROM CO THE NINETEEN. THIS BUDGET ENSURES THAT WE ARE ABLE TO CONTINUE SUPPORTING FOOD BANKS AND OTHER CRITICAL LOCAL NEEDS IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE ARE ASKING US TO HELP THEM. AS WELL AS BUILD AND MAINTAIN THE NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE TO RESPOND TO FUTURE EMERGENCIES. AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS WITH REGARD TO OUR WORK AROUND FOOD BANKS OR ANYTHING ELSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- FINANCE ANY ADDITIONS YOU WANT TO ADD. NUMBER RIGHT THE LA. VERY GOOD I'M BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE SENATOR DR SO THANK YOU- YES MISTER FRIDAY HAVE A GREAT- HIGH REGARD FOR CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS ON AND THE WORK THAT'S DONE I'VE BEEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE VOLUNTEERS MYSELF. I JUST WANT TO ASK THE QUESTION- I KNOW LAST YEAR. WE DID APPROVE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS OVER TWO YEARS. AND DO I UNDERSTAND RIGHT YOU'RE ASKING FOR AN ADDITIONAL. THIRTEEN MILLION. THIS COMING YEAR AND TWENTY TWO MILLION THE FOLLOWING YEAR FOR. NEW AMOUNT OF THIRTY FIVE MILLION. THAT IS CORRECT YEAH SO ANYWAY I THE- ONLY BECAUSE OF THE EXTRAORDINARY. ECONOMIC POSITION THAT WERE IN AYE- I WOULD ASK TO. WE THINK THAT- THERE ARE SO MANY- PROGRAMS THAT ARE. ARE DIRECTLY DIRECTLY IMPACTING WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE HAVE FOOD ON THEIR ON THEIR TABLE- TO BE ABLE TO USE THE VOLUNTEERS SO- WHILE I FEEL VERY MUCH IN A DILEMMA I THINK ON THE WORK THAT YOU DO IS TREMENDOUS BUT- I ALSO THINK THAT THERE'S THE THINGS THAT WERE BEING ASKED TO CUT. THAT OFF OUR LIFE AND DEATH SITUATIONS. THANK YOU WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE WORK THAT YOU DO AND THE WORK THAT THE VOLUNTEERS ARE DOING THEY'VE BEEN AND IT INCREDIBLE ADDITION TO THE FOOD. BANKS AND TO ALL THE SERVICE AGENCIES AND THEY BEEN PARTNERING WITH AND I CONCUR WITH WHAT- CENTER DRAWS RIGHTS HAS HAS TO SAY IT TO- PROBABLY NEVER. A BETTER TIME TO ADD. TO YOUR TO YOUR SERVICES INTO YOUR CORE THEN WHEN PEOPLE ARE NOT WORKING BECAUSE THIS GIVES THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK AND THEN GO TO SCHOOL BUT IT'S ALSO A REALLY BAD TIME BECAUSE WE HAVE TO MAKE CUTS EVERYWHERE AND SO- THIS IS ONE OF THOSE ITEMSIT WILL REMAIN OPEN AND I THINK YOU FOR. FOR YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY AND FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING- I THINK IT'S TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT BUT- FOR MAKING SOME TOUGH TOUGH CHOICES SO- AS I SAID THIS WILL WILL REMAIN OPEN THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND MOVE ON. TO THE NEXT ITEM. WITH WHICH IS ISSUE NUMBER ONE NINETY SEVEN CONTROL ELEVEN POINT NINETY. ITS THE IT'S THE- CONTROL SECTION. WILL TURN IT OVER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ONE NINETY SIX VERY. IT'S A NEW NUMBER. WHICH IS THE NINETY SIX ONE NINETY SIX THIS IS ONE NINETY SEVEN. YOU MAY HAVE THE AGENDA FROM YESTERDAY. OKAY. IS THERE SOMEBODY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT CAN ADDRESS THIS THAT SINCE THIS- ASSUMES CONTROL BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I FIGURED SOMEBODY WOULD WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. IT'S THE HOT SEAT. WELCOME A GREAT REST DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YEAH THE CONTROL SECTION ONE POINT NINE NO WILL BE USED TO. OKAY FINDS PER YEAR FINDING IT WAS A WRITE UP FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NINETY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. FOR A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS ARE SEATED IN THE CONTROL SECTION. SO THAT THE MONIES WILL BE EXPANDED OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS THERE'S A DEADLINE FOR THE END OF DECEMBER. I AND SO THIS WILL DEFINITELY. HE VERY WELL USED- CONTROL SECTION AND WE- NEEDED INSTEAD OF A CONTROL SECTION TWENTY EIGHT WHICH IS HUGE HOLE FEDERAL FUNDS. YOU SEE CONTROL SECTION. THIS WILL WE NEED AGNETHA FUNDS ARE VERY. DISTINGUISHED FROM THE NORMAL US SECTION TWENTY EIGHT PROCESS THERE WE GO THIS CONTROL SECTIONAL BE THE MOST USEFUL PROCESS THANK YOU. OF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WELCOME. WELL IF YOU GIVE US A SECOND WORK WILL THAT WILL GET YOU TURNED ON FOR YOU MAY NEED TO TURN YOURSELF ON. CAN YOU HEAR ME THIS IS HOW IN PERSON AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE YES WE CAN HEAR YOU NOW THANK YOU FOR YOUR CALL THANK YOU SORRY ABOUT THAT. AND SAID GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS THE FIRST OF A FEW CONTROL SECTION AND THAT COMMITTEE IS CONSIDERING RELATED TO COME IN NINETEEN. SO I WILL PROVIDE SOME SPECIFIC COMMENTS ON EACH CONTROL SECTION BUT I'D POINT OUT THAT THERE REALLY IS AN OVERALL THEME TO ALL OF OUR COMMENTS. WHICH IS THAT WHILE SOME NEW LANGUAGE MAY BE JUSTIFIED IN ORDER TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE COMPANY IN RESPONSE. OVERALL WE THINK THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSED PROCESS THESE THAT ARE OUTLINED IN THE SECTIONS GO TOO FAR IN DELEGATING KEY LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY FOR EXAMPLE RELATED TO A CORPORATION. SO SPECIFICALLY WITH REGARD TO CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN POINT NINE HELLO. WE RECOGNIZE THAT AN ADDITIONAL PROCESS BEYOND THE EXISTING CONTROL SECTION TWENTY EIGHT MIGHT BE WARRANTED FOR ALLOCATING THESE FEDERAL FUNDS GIVEN. BUT THERE ARE CONSTRAINTS ON THE CORONAVIRUS REALLY FRIENDS AND THAT THERE'S SOME URGENCY IN ALLOCATING THESE FUNDS. HOWEVER WE THINK IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO MODIFY THIS PROCESS TO INCREASE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT- AND INVOLVEMENT SO FOR EXAMPLE CURRENTLY THERE'S NO NOTIFICATION. OR FORMAL LEGISLATIVE IN FRIGHT ON ANY REALLOCATION OF THIS FUNDING SO THERE'S- THE MINISTRATIONS PROVIDED SORT OF ROCK FUNDING PLAN. BUT IF THOSE CHANGE- THE LEGISLATURE ISN'T ISN'T THERE'S NO NO FORMAL PROCESS FOR NOTIFYING LEGISLATURE SEEKING LEGISLATURE'S. ONE ON FOR MY LANGUAGE WOULD BE. THAT THE MINUTES PROVIDE NOTIFICATIONS ABOUT FUNDS THEIR REALLOCATED THROUGH THIS CONTROL SECTION. INCLUDING REQUIRING SPECIFIC INFORMATION IN THOSE NOTIFICATIONS TO ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE GET THE TYPE OF INFORMATION NEEDS. AND WE ALSO THINK IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE TO HAVE IN OUR REPORTING ON SEPTEMBER FIRST TWENTY TWENTY UNSETTLING WOULD HAVE KIND OF A CHECK IN AT THAT POINT- AND ENVISIONED POTENTIALLY RELOCATIONS AT THAT POINT. SO THAT'S PROBABLY YEAH. LOGICAL TIME FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO GET SOME REVISED INFORMATION FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT WHETHER THERE'S BEEN FULL TAKE UP OF THE- PROGRAMS THAT THEY'RE EXPECTING TO FIND UNDER THIS AND- WHAT THEIR PLAN IS GOING FORWARD. VERY GOOD THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT INFORMATION- QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. CENTER NIELSEN. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THIS WHOLE ISSUE IS VERY BROAD. AND IF IT'S NOT NEW THAT IS MEETING THE LEGISLATURE'S SEATING MORE AND MORE AUTHORITY TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AND THE WHAT I CALL ADMINISTRATIVE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT THE FRONT. BUT IT'S KIND OF COME TO A HEAD RIGHT NOW. THE CHAIRS AND VICE CHAIRS OF BOTH BUDGET COMMITTEES HAVE RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THIS TREND. OF LATE AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME OF CRISIS MANY MEMBERS HAVE BEEN VOICING CONCERNS ABOUT THE IT. AND ONE OF THE OLD STRATEGIES WAS TO REQUIRE- BUDGET CONTROL LANGUAGE THE REQUIRED REPORTS. THE LEGISLATURE. I'M TO THE POINT WHERE I THINK THOSE ARE I DON'T WANT HIM ANYMORE. REPORTS MEAN NOTHING THEY GET FILED AND FORGOTTEN. BUT WE NEED ACTUAL AUTHORITY CITATIONS OF AUTHORITY. AND RE DELEGATIONS OF AUTHORITY TO THE LEGISLATURE WE NEED TO REST SOME OF THAT CONTROL BACK. THAT IS A BROADLY APPLICABLE ISSUE BUT PROBABLY MORE SO IN MY OPINION IT THIS MOST DESPERATE TIME OF ALL. WE JUST HAVE TO A PAUCITY OF NOT MUCH OF WHAT'S GOING ON. AND WE ARE RESPONSIBLE TO THE CITIZENS. AND IT'S NOT US. LARA TORTILLAS MEMBERS. AS MUCH AS A CHIEF FORTY OF THE VOTERS OF CITIZENS THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA. AND NOT JUST THE VOTERS THE CITIZENS. THEY NEED TO KNOW AND I NEED TO HAVE SOMEBODY WHO'S WATCHING THE CHICKEN COOP. SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO LEVEL LOTS OF DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS AS WE PROCEED. AND AGAIN I SAY IT'S A NO CRITICISM OF THIS PARTICULAR ADMINISTRATION IT'S BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME BUT NOW WE'RE AT A MORE CRITICAL TIME- A KINDLE WHEN WE WERE THAT MAYBE THE PROP THIRTEEN YEARS WERE WORTH A LITTLE SIMILAR. ABOUT TWENTY TEN TO TWENTY ELEVEN BROWN FORTY FIVE BILLION IN THE RED THAT WAS ANOTHER SUCH TIME. I'VE BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME AND I WATCH THIS HAPPEN. A DAY BILL BY BILL DEAL WHEREBY DEAL LANDED POPPING UP RACIAL MANUALS. AND THAT AND EIGHT PIECE A MINISTRY DIRECTIVES. AND YOU KNOW THE MOST OF IT IS NEVER BEEN CHALLENGED ILLEGALLY BUT I THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD PREVAIL WHERE THEY AND LET'S HOPE WE DON'T HAVE TO EVER GET TO THAT POINT. ENTER DRAWS A SURE I'M I THINK IT'S THE SAME I KNOW WE'RE OR THREE AYE AGENDA ITEMS THAT REFERRED BASICALLY THE SAME THING IS TO WHAT DEGREE. TO PUT DEGREES- IS AS YOU SAID- OUR ROLE AS LEGISLATURE SEATED TO THE TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH SO I CONTINUE TO HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS FRANKLY I JUST ONE TECHNICAL QUESTION IS THIS ONLY USE FOR PURPOSES OF FUNDING. AS FAR AS THIS KIND OF AUTHORITY OR- YOU MEAN RECEIVING FEDERAL FUNDS THAT COME IN AND THEN YOU DON'T KNOW I MEAN THE AUTHORITY. UNDER THESE- FOR EXAMPLE LEAST THREE CONTROL SECTIONS IS THAT ONLY FOR. IS THAT A THIRTY ONLY ON ISSUES OF FUNDING OR CAN IT. CAN IT BE USED FOR OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE NON FINANCIAL NON FUNDING THAT MAKES US A QUESTION. MAYBE THE LA OWN. THAT MIGHT BE ABLE INAPPROPRIATE QUESTION EITHER FOR FINANCE ARE FOR THE LA FINANCE DEALS WITH FUNDING SO MAYBE MAYBE THE QUESTION SHOULD GO TO THE LA. SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS IS THAT THESE- KEITH IS A CONTROL SECTION BASICALLY ALLOCATE THE FUNDING SO THAT. OF COURSE THERE'S A THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT POLICY CONSEQUENCES TO THAT BECAUSE IF YOU ALLOCATE FUNDING TO A SPECIFIC KIND OF NEW ACTIVITY THAT THAT CERTAINLY HAS SOME- SOME SIGNIFICANT QUALITY CONSEQUENCES BUT- REALLY THESE CONTROLS ACTIONS ARE- WHEN THEY WERE ANY DISCUSSING ELEVEN POINT NINE NOW ELEVEN POINT NINE FIVE AND THEN SECTION THIRTY SIX RELATE TO ALLOCATING. FEDERAL FUNDS AND- LATER ON WE'LL DISCUSS STATE AND I'M TO. ACTIVITIES AND ALL RELATED TO COMMITTEE. OKAY WELL JUST JUST ONE ONE FIVE THAT I HAD WAS. UP BYOND THE FUNDING- THAT WE OUGHT TO THINK ABOUT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION. HOW DO WE- MORE TO OF. THE OF JOB. IN THIS IN THIS A IN THE TIME IN THIS RECOVERY. HOW DO WE DO MORE FOR IT FOR JOB CREATION IF WE COULD USE THAT AUTHORITY. TO EXPAND ON THAT ESPECIALLY WITH OUR- AMID PROCESS IT AND I KNOW A NUMBER OF ISSUES CAME UP OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS ABOUT THE KINDS OF CONTRACTS THAT WERE ENTERED INTO. AND HOW CAN WE USE THE FUNDING IN SUCH A WAY THAT REALLY BENEFITS JOB CREATION ONE WORD MOST DESPERATE AND MOST NEED OF IT SO JUST A THOUGHT THANK YOU MEASURE. THIRTY NEAR NIELSEN DID YOU HAVE ANOTHER CHAL A CONCERN WELL JUST A- PUT NOTABLE NOT US NOT A FOOTNOTE IT'S AN ABSOLUTE INTEGRAL PART. I DIDN'T GET MY HAND UP QUICK ENOUGH LEGEND WAS BEAT ME TO IT BUT ANOTHER THING NOT ONLY FISCAL POLICY BUT MAJOR. POLICY PERIOD. HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED OVER THE YEARS. BEYOND THE CONTROL THE LEGISLATURE WITHOUT ANY STATUTORY AUTHORITY. AND THAT'S A SENSITIVE ISSUE AS WELL POLICY DOES COME IN AND I CALLED GOVERNOR LAFAYETTE WHEN THAT THE DOCTOR OUT DEPARTMENT OPERATIONAL MENU MENU A MEMORANDUM COMES OUT. THAT SETS THE POLICY FOR THE AGENCY. AND I AN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES WE HAVE CHALLENGED AGENCY MY STAFF AND I WHAT YOUR CITATION OF AUTHORITY. AND A LOT BLANK AT USE IT. AND ONE THAT REALLY IS TELLING IT'S ALMOST HUMOROUS BUT I WAS READING THAT TO A% LEGAL DIMERA SEVERAL YEARS AGO NOW ASK ME WHY I WAS WASTING MY TIME READING THIS MAJOR LAWSUIT THE QUESTION OF THE JUDGE. TO CALTRANS. BUT THE JUDGE ASKED FOR A CITATION OF AUTHORITY. AND THE RESPONSE WAS BECAUSE WE ARE CALTRANS. THAT WAS A CITATION OF AUTHORITY. THAT WAS NOT A FREUDIAN SLIP. WHY I AGREE WITH YOU ON THE ON THE POLICY ISSUE I THINK BUT THAT'S PART OF THE CHALLENGE WITH THEM WITH CEDING CONTROL AS IT WE JUST WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A POLICY THAT WE UNDERSTAND IN THAT WE'VE ABOUT ACQUIESCENCE AND THAT THERE'S A- THERE'S FAIRNESS INEQUITIES GET YOUR ABSOLUTE RIGHT WE HAVE CONSTITUENTS THAT ARE ASKING US YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THIS AND- AND I THINK THE REAL- THE REAL. WE KNOW WHAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING SO- THIS ONE IS A IS A HOLD OPEN AND I THINK- THE LIKE I REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS. BOB THE LA- COMMENTS IN REGARDS TO. THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE MIGHT ASK FOR AND- I THINK THAT TO THE EXTENT IT'S HOW HELD OPEN IT GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THIS FURTHER. THE ADMINISTRATION. ON THE SERVER WILL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ITEM WHICH IS THE- ITEM ONE NINETY EIGHT CONTROL ISSUE ELEVEN POINT NINETY FIVE WHICH AGAIN IS A- A CONTROL SET SECTION ISSUE AND WILL I TURN IT OVER TO THE PART IN A FINANCE AGAIN. AND YOU CAN PROPERTY DESPERATE PRETTY SURE BECAUSE I THINK WE'LL MAKE OUR COMMENTS PICTURED IN TERMS OF THESE A CONTROL ISSUES BECAUSE IT'S DID OR DID OR DID OF. THANK YOU NEW KRISTIN SHOPS AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I THINK THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF CONFUSION ON WHO IS COVERING THIS ISSUE AND I THANK MY COLLEAGUE GREG PRESS. FOR I'M JUST OUTLINING A LITTLE BIT RELATIVE TO CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN NINETY AND THEN ELEVEN NINETY FIVE. I'M JUST BROADLY FOR THE TWO PIECE. AND WE ARE WE THESE BOTH BOTH OF THESE PIECES SUPPORT A STATE ALLOCATION AND PROVIDE THE FRAMEWORK TO BE ABLE TO DISTRIBUTE AND SPEND THESE FEDERAL LANDS AND WE KNOW ABOUT TODAY AND ONCE WE DO NOT KNOW ABOUT SO JUST FOR THE BILL-DURATION PRIOR TO THAT ARE JUST AFTER THE NAME REVISION WAS RELEASED RECEIVE NOTIFICATION FROM CITY SPEEDS THAT WE WERE YET NEARLY HALF A BILLION DOLLARS. OR CASTING AND KIND. STATE THAT'S JUST A PIECE OF THE OP PATIENT WOULD ROLL TO THE STATE I'M WE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE AND HEARD THE CONCERNS OF THE LEGISLATURE DURING THE BROADER OVERVIEW HEARING ON MONDAY AND WE HAVE ACTUALLY DRAFTED LANGUAGE WE WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU STAFF THAT WOULD PROVIDE FOR A TEN DAY NOTIFICATION. TO THE LEGSLATURE ABOUT BOTHTHE ALLOCATION AND ANY POTENTIAL REALLOCATION OF THE FINE AND SHOULD WE FIND OUT OR DISCOVER HONOR CHECK IN DATE SEPTEMBER FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THAT THE FUNDS ARE NOT BEING SPENT OR SOME OF OUR ASSUMPTIONS THAT. JENNIFER IS. OUR OR SPEND THOSE FINE TURN OUT TO NOT BE TRUE WE MAY NOT HAVE EXPENDITURE LEVELS OUT THE LEVELS ARE CASTING FOR INSTANCE WE SOME OF OUR PROGRAMS SO WE WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND DEVELOPING NOT NOTIFICATION PROCESS AND WE STILL THINK. UNIQUE SITUATION THE RAPIDLY EVOLVING FRAMEWORK- IN TERMS OF GUIDANCE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS THE ABILITY TO AND ALL OF THE CURRENT VIRUS RELIEF FINDS NO LATER THAN DECEMBER THIRTIETH. AND WE HAVE PRESS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE U. S. TREASURY ON WHETHER THAT COULD BE. OBLIGATED FOR SUSPENSION WE HAVE HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR NO MATTER WHICH WAY WE BASS THE QUESTIONER POSE THE QUESTION AND THAT IS A PRETTY HARD DATE FOR US IN TERMS OF SPENDING SO IT DOES REQUIRE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT KINDS OF FLEXIBILITY. THANK YOU AND HAVE THEM UNDER PROVISIONS OF SECTION TWENTY EIGHT. AND THE- OTHER PROVISIONS BEFORE YOU RIGHT NOW REALLY JUST DEALS WITH OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FRIENDS AS THOSE WORDS ARE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE STATE. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY ARE ALLOWABLE WE CAN OFFSET GENERAL FUND COSTS OR EXPENSES THAT WERE FRONTAGE EVEN INTO IN THE CURRENT YEAR TO DEAL WITH THE PANDEMIC IF WE HAVE A DEDICATED. FEDERAL FUNDS SOURCE THAT CERTAINLY MORE OPTIMAL AND ULTIMATELY HELPS THE BROAD GENERAL FUND CONDITION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M LA. HELLO AGAIN ACTED WITH REGARD TO SEX CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN POINT NINE FIVE AND AS YOU HEARD THIS CONTROL SECTION ALLOWS THE ADMINISTRATION WHAT'S ABILITY IN ALLOCATING FEDERAL FUNDS IN THOSE ARE BEYOND THOSE THAT WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THEIR BEYOND THAT THE FUNDS THAT ARE IN THE CARRIAGE ACT- AND SO IT'S REALLY COURSE THE COMING NINETEEN RESPONSE INTO AN OFFSET THOSE GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATIONS. AND WE KNOW THAT CURRENTLY THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE DOES NOT HAVE A REQUIREMENT THAT YOU ACTED A BY THE LEGISLATURE OR SEEK FORMAL IMPRESS WE'RE PLEASED TO HEAR THAT FINANCES OPENS YOU AMENDING THE LANGUAGE TO PROVIDE SOME LEVEL I'M A WORSE OVER SAY WE THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT- AND SO IF I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS ON THAT WE DO WANT TO KNOW THAT UNLIKE CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN POINT NINE- THERE'S NO EXPENDITURE PLAN FOR THESE FUNDS IN THIS IS BECAUSE- THE STATE DOESN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT KINDS. WILL RECEIVE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE DON'T KNOW THE SIZE OF WHATEVER ALLOCATION WE ALSO DON'T KNOW IF THEY'LL BE RESTRICTIONS LIKE THERE ARE I'M CURRENTLY THE CURES ACT FUNDING SO I'M IT MIGHT PERHAPS BE THAT YOU KNOW THE AT FOR MY BROUGHT PURPOSE AND CERTAINLY THAT'S WHY POSSIBILITY. SO TIED TO IT'S CLEAR THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD HAVE A FORMAL ROLE IN WAITING IN ON HOW THESE FUTURE. THEN AND HEALTHCARE A LARGE BOWL GIVEN THE- CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE RELATED TO. THERE RIGHT ABOUT. ONE YOU COULD JUST CREATED DIFFERENT. FOR LET. IN SESSION NOT AND YOU COULD HAVE SOMEONE FOR. YOU COULD ALSO LIMIT THE USE OF FUNDS OR- THEY AMOUNT OF FUNDS THAT COULD BE AND IT COULD GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS AGAIN THIS COULD BE. THE SERVICE I KNOW WHAT FUTURE FEDERAL FUNDS THE STATE WILL RECEIVE AND SO- SO HE COULD GET SOME GUARD RAILS TO KIND OF- LIMIT THIS AUTHORITY IN OTHER WAYS AS WELL. THERE WOULD BE HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH- WITH YOUR STAFF AND ADMINISTRATION. AND TO THINK ABOUT SOME DIFFERENT OPTIONS. VERY GOOD- COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE. IT SEEMS IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. I MEAN I THERE'S NO WAY THAT THIS LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO. TURN DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS THAT HELP US TO DO THE JOB WE NEED TO DO- IT JUST TO THE EXTENT THAT. MY NOTE HERE IS FUTURE FOR FUTURE FUNDS AND TO THE EXTENT WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHAT THOSE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE. IN WHAT CATEGORY THEY'RE GONNA BE AND I JUST THINK THE LEGISLATURE HAVE ABSOLUTELY HAS TO BE INVOLVED IN THE DISCUSSION. ONCE WE RECEIVE NOTICE THAT THOSE FUNDS ARE GOING TO COME AND- WHETHER WERE IN SESSION OR NOT WE ACT VERY QUICKLY AND I WILL SAY THAT I'VE SPENT MORE TIME ON SOME PHONE CALLS AND I EVER THOUGHT I'D EVER I DIDN'T EVEN KNOWS HIM. WITH THE WORD OR WITH THE THING- BUT BUT WE'VE GOTTEN REALLY GOOD AND WE DEVELOPED. IN THIS. THE VOTE AND TO THINK SELECT. AT A DISTANCE SO- IF THERE IS NO OTHER COMMENTS WILL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ITEM. YEAH SENATOR DRAWS OF YEAH THIS IS I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY THE STRONGEST. OF ALL THE- THE AUTHORITIES THAT ARE BEING- THIRTY THAT'S BEEN ASKED FOR SO THERE'S LIKE. PRETTY MUCH NO OVERSIGHT. NOW WE'VE BEEN OFFERED SOME NOTICE. I MEAN ALL OF THOSE THINGS COMBINED. YEAH VERY GOOD- WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR FOR THAT TESTIMONY- ISSUE NUMBER ONE NINETY NINE WHICH IS CONTROLLED SECTION THIRTY SIX- WOULD TURN IT OVER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WELCOME WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF FINANCE. THIS THIS CONTROLSECTION IS FOR BECAUSE IN THE REVISION AND IS A SATISFIED A KID AND AS I CONTINUE TO PROFESSIONAL COVE IN NINETEEN RESPONSE ACTIVITIES IN THE BUDGET YEAR THIS IS- PROPOSED ESPECIALLY IN THE EVENT THAT THERE IS A SURGE OF NEW CASES IN THE BUDGET YOU'RE AND AS YOUR AGENDA NOTES THIS IS MODELED AFTER THE CURRENT GOAL SECTION THIRTY THAT WAS PUT IN PLACE BY SP. TO RESPOND TO QUESTIONS. VERY GOOD THE LA. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES THAT THE LEGISLATURE SET ASIDE TWO POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS IN A FUND THAT THE GOVERNOR COULD ACCESS FOR FUTURE KOBE NINETEEN RELATED EXPENSES THAT HAVEN'T YET BEEN IDENTIFIED AND SO AS YOU HEARD THE ADMINISTRATION IS. PROPOSING THE USE OF CONTROL SECTION THIRTY SIX TO EXPAND THESE FUNDS FOR ANY PURPOSE RELATED AND TO BASICALLY COVER NINETEEN WITH THE SEVENTY TWO HOUR NOTIFICATION OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE. SO THIS PROPOSED LANGUAGE IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS PUT IN PLACE I SB EIGHTY NINE TO GOVERN THE BILLION DOLLARS AND THAT WAS- APPROPRIATE BY THE LEGISLATURE RIGHT BEFORE LEGISLATURE IS ABOUT TWO OUT OF SESSION- FOR THAT SOCIAL DISTANCING. I'M SO THERE IS A STRONG REASON FOR DOING AT THAT POINT GIVEN THE BILL I JUST ENJOY THE COULD BE IN SESSION HOWEVER WE WOULD KNOW THAT THE SECTION THIRTY SIX PROCESS HAS BEEN CHALLENGING FOR THE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT PERSPECTIVE- BUT THE LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME TO REVIEW THOSE NOTICES. ANALYSIS IN HIS IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT TO GET- THE INFORMATION LEGISLATURE HAS REQUESTED. ADDITIONALLY WE WANT TO FLAG THAT ARE IN YOUR STANDING IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES AN ADDITIONAL THREE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AND THAT WOULD BE EYOND THIS TO CREATE NINE BILLION THAT WOULD BE GOVERNED. BY THE CONTROL SECTION. LEADS DIRECT KOBE NINETEEN RELATED X. I'M AND THAT WOULD BOTH CURRENT. AS WELL AS THE- YOU'RE- I YET RECEIVED INFORMATION ON HOW THIS THESE FUNDS WOULD BE SPENT- AND FOR EXAMPLE WHICH DEPARTMENTS WOULD RECEIVE THEM FOR WHAT PURPOSE- AND IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO US THAT THE SPENDING WOULD BE SUBJECT TO ANY KIND OF CONTROL SECTION OR OTHER PROCESS- OR- REQUIRE ANY KIND OF LEGISLATIVE NOTIFICATION. I'M AT LEAST AT THIS POINT THAT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING- SO THIS IS ALSO REALLY A PARTICULAR NO BECAUSE IT'S EVEN LAST- LAST KIND OF CONTROL THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS OVER THIS FINDING. THAT PENDING IS CURRENTLY ON INCLUDED IN NINETEEN OH ONE. BUDGET ITEM. SO WE STERN THINK ALL OF THE FUNDING THAT'S BEING PROPOSED SHOULD- BE SUBJECT LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. ON LEGISLATIVE CONTROL- AND SO PART OF THAT CERTAINLY THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDING SHOULD GO THROUGH A PROCESS THAT THE LEGISLATURE COMFORTABLE WITH AND ALSO WE THINK THAT. I'M EVEN THE DEAFENING THAT'S BEING PROPOSED FOR BACK. CONTROL SECTION THIRTY SIX THAT THAT PROCESS COULD BE ENHANCED IN A MORE ROBUST TO ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE. HAS AN APPROPRIATE OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN ON THE USE OF THOSE FUNDS. AND AGAIN THEY'RE PROBABLY MULTIPLE DIFFERENT TYPES OF OPTIONS THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER- IT COULD FOR EXAMPLE AGAIN SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HAVE MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY SET DIFFERENT NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS DEPENDING. ON WHETHER THE LEGISLATURE IS IN SESSION IT COULD REQUIRE LEGISLATION LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL PRIOR TO YOU- FUNDS BEING MADE AVAILABLE. IF YOU PUREE IT OR REQUIRE CERTAIN THINGS BEING MADE AVAILABLE WHEN THAT NOTIFICATION. I'M IS MADE I'M ALSO AND DIFFERENT THE COULD BE RESTRICTIONS ON THE TYPES OF USED TO FIND- OR THERE COULD BE ADDITIONAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING THOSE AFTER THE FACT SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN KEEP TRACK OF HOW. MANY HAS BEEN USED. VERY GOOD. TWENTY CENTER NIELSEN. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT TO OUR ATTENTION AS TO A CURRENT AND LOOMING ISSUE BEFORE US. AND KIND OF THE PROOF IN THE PUDDING I THINK IS ONE EIGHTY NINE WAS PASSED THE IT DID A CORD A LOT OF AUTHORITY. AND THEN A MAJOR- MAJOR EXPENDITURES WERE THEN. FOR MASKS. AND MANY OF US WERE REQUESTING INFORMATION ABOUT THE CONTRACTS. IN FACT I HAVE A PENDING THE- REQUEST WILL JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE TO AUDIT THE CONTRACT. NOW I'M WAITING MY WAY THROUGH IT MYSELF THE I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY- BUT I'M ACTUALLY FAVORABLY DISPOSED TO THE DIRECTION I'M SEEING THAT IT WAS NEGOTIATED. BUT BUT HERE'S THE POINT. THIS IS IN THE BILLIONS THAT WE'RE AUTHORIZED THE EXPENDITURE OF IT BUT THAT WE THE LEGISLATORS HAVE NO CONTROL OVER. AND THAT'S GOING TO WAY TOO FAR SO WITH A AND I HAVE NO. QUESTION THAT THE ADMINISTRATION CANNOT COME TO TERMS WITH OUR CONCERNS ABOUT BEING INFORMED AND EVEN APPROVING OF CERTAIN THINGS THAT'S A GENERAL OBSERVATION BUT I THINK THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT MOMENT. IN A SEVERAL YEAR EVOLUTION. OF POLICY IMPLEMENTATION AND BUDGET EXPENDITURES AROUND HERE AND I AM HAPPY TO SEE IT THE TIME HAS COME. THANK YOU MANAGER. THANK YOU SENATOR AWESOME YET- I HAVE A QUESTION IS. WHERE WITH THIS- STOPPING IN THE FACT. I MEAN WHAT'S THE TIME PERIOD IN WHICH- THIS AUTHORITY WOULD EXIST HERE. AT HE SAID ALRP FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THIS IS PROPOSED FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND BUDGET BILL SO THIS IS CONTROL SECTION PROPOSED OR THAT THAT BUDGET ACTIVE TWENTY TWENTY. OKAY WELL I JUST WANNA. AGAIN THIS IS LIKE THE OTHER ONES I THINK ON TOO MUCH CONTROL WITHOUT AND ENGAGING THE LEGISLATURE AND ALSO THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S INVOLVED- IF YOU PUT IT ALL TOGETHER IS THAT IS THAT CORRECT THAT IT WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY SIX OR SEVEN BILLION. WHAT'S THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF MONEY. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE RIGHT WE'RE CONTINUING TO DERIVE FIND AND REFINED THE EXPENDITURES AS YOU KNOW AND YOU ALL ARE VERY WELL AWARE- THE EXPENDITURES WHEN EXPENDITURES ARE NEEDED AND RAN. AND CONTINUES TO BE REFINED AND WE ARE ALSO AS PART OF THAT REALLY TRYING TO TRACK WHAT AND THAT'S GENERAL FUND IMPACTS AREN'T WHEN WE'RE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT POTENTIAL REIMBURSEMENT AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL FEDERAL FUNDS THAT WERE DISCUSSED EARLIER ITEMS AGAIN CONTINUING TO DO THAT AND CONTINUING TO. PROVIDE INFORMATION ON WHAT THAT MEANS FOR THE GENERAL FUND AS WE MAKE BUDGETARY DECISIONS I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IS THAT- WHILE WE RECOGNIZE IT THAT- WE'RE WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT THE GENERAL FUND RIGHT NOW THE pIMPORTANT EVEN IF WE GET REIMBURSED I THINK WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT WE'VE EXPANDED AND THEN HOW MUCH OF THAT WE'VE GOTTEN REIMBURSED AND- AND HOW MUCH IS LEFT AND I'M NOT SURE THAT ANY OF US HAVE A REALLY GOOD GRASP ON ANY OF THAT. SO ON THE MORE MORE DISCUSSION ON THAT YEAH HI SENATOR NIELSEN. IF I HAVE A- FOLLOW UP ON THAT MATTER BECAUSE A- GIFT TO. THE MUEZZIN MEMORY OF MY SHALL I SAY.DURING THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION LEGISLATION WAS PASSED ALLOWING A GOVERNOR TO DECLARE A DROUGHT EMERGENCY NOW THAT WAS ALSO OF. AN EMERGENCY OF GREAT MAGNITUDE. BUT MY FIRST READING OF THE BILL INDICATED TO ME THERE WAS NO. SEC TIME THAT THIS EMERGENCY WAS NOT IN EXISTENCE ANYMORE. I DOUBT THAT THIS LAST DECLARATION OF EMERGENCY IS. NOT STILL IN EFFECT RATHER THAN IT IS BECAUSE THERE WAS NO TERMINATION TIME. AND MY READING OF EIGHTY NINE AND WHERE WE'RE AT WITH THAT I DON'T THINK THERE IS THERE EITHER. SO I THINK MY POINT IS WE HAVE TO BE A LITTLE BIT CAREFUL ABOUT JUST SIGNING A BLANK CHECK INS IN HERE. WE NEED TO HAVE A HAND. IN SOME OF THE DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE REGARDING POLICY REGARDING THE BUDGET. AND REGARDING EXPENDITURES THERE FROM SELF. THANK YOU. I DO AGREE- MY NOTES A BLANK CHECK. SO IT'S A AM I THINK WE AT THE CONCERN IS THAT WE NEED TO KNOW- THINK WE NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE ACCOUNTING AND- THIS IS OBVIOUSLY AN AGO SHE XIN ISSUES- SO THAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO HOW TO HANDLE ALL OF THESE AYE THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT- FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THE CONTRACT THAT WAS LET FOR THE FOR THE MASKS WITH WITH CRITICAL- AND IT IT IT FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED. THE BOTTOM LEVEL OF CONCERN THAT THAT I HEARD IN MY COMMUNITY ABOUT THE LACK OF PP AND THE FACT THAT MEDICAL PERFECT COULDN'T GET WHAT THEY NEEDED IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THEMSELVES SAFE AND THAT THAT IS ABSOLUTELY UNTENABLE SO WHATEVER HAVE HAVE HAPPENED TO GET US TO GET THIS FIRST LINE SO THAT WE WERE THERE AND WE CAN GET THEM. THE ITEMS I'M I'M ALL FOR IT. BUT WE IT'S DONE AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT. WHAT HAVE WHAT TRANSPIRED AND MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS DONE- IN THE WAY THAT THE STATE. WOULD WANT IT TO BE DONE WITH AN ARMS ARM'S LENGTH CONTRACT AND IT WAS IT WAS ABOVE BOARD AND SO I APPRECIATE YOU ARE VIEWING THAT CONTRACT BECAUSE I AM AN ATTORNEY AND I. THAT'S A THAT'S A LOT OF WORK TO GO THROUGH THAT STUFF. AND I DO APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR TAKING TAKING THE LEAD IN AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAD WHAT WE NEEDED. BUT BUT IT'S NOT LIKELY THAT IT'S GONNA HAPPEN OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND SO- I THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE AT THE TABLE FOR MONTHS MOST OF THIS SO. I DO I DO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY THIS IS ONE OF THE HOLD TO. OPEN ITEMS. AND I EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE. OF DIFFERENT LEVELS OF. OF A POSSIBILITY. THAT THAT THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY OF DIFFERENT LEVELS OF. OF CONTROL AND THAT WERE WILLING TO GIVE WITH DIFFERENT AMOUNTS. OF DOLLARS. US SO THAT WE CAN. WE CAN LET THE ADMINISTRATION MAKE SURE THAT WERE. THAT WE GET WHAT WE NEED IN IN AND HANDLING THIS PANDEMIC WE HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. TO WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER. TWO HUNDRED. WHICH IS THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT EXPANDING BBO INTO THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION AND- INNOVATION. AND WILL TURN THIS OVER TO THE- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. UNLESS WE HAVE THE BE- HERE. WELCOME A GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR REALLY HARBISON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AT COMMISSIONER AL RUNS FROM. MY BUSINESS OVERSIGHT WILL BE PRESENT. GREAT BEFORE IS YOURS. WELCOME. AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS MANNY ALVAREZ THE COMMISSIONER OF THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT. GOVERNOR CONTINUE TO INCLUDE IN THIS MAY REVISE THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL CONCERNING THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PROTECTION AND INNOVATION. IS NOW MORE THAN EVER IT IS IMPORTANT TO MOVE FORWARD A PROPOSAL THAT WILL PROTECT CALIFORNIANS FROM UNSCRUPULOUS FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND PRACTICES. THAT WOULD EVEN THE FINANCIAL TROUBLE WERE IN. THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC IS OBVIOUSLY DEVASTATED SO MANY CALIFORNIANS WE KNOW THAT FINANCIAL CRISES MAGNIFY OVER ALL THESE FINANCIAL PREDATION. THE BUDGET PROPOSAL WOULD HELP COMBAT THESE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES FOR SOME OF THE FOLLOWING. A NEW CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION DIVISION ACOSTA RESEARCH EDUCATION AND OUTREACH. I SUPERVISION AND REGISTRATION FUNCTION TO REGISTRANTS SUPERVISE NEW CLASSES OF COVERED PERSONS OFFERING FINANCIAL SERVICES CALIFORNIANS. THIS IS AN ENFORCEMENT DIVISION RESOURCES TO BETTER PROTECT CALIFORNIANS ARE PURSUE BAD ACTORS. AND THE NEW COVERED PERSONS POPULATION. A NEW FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION OFFICE TO ENCOURAGE INNOVATIVE FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND THE RESPONSIBLE DEVELOPMENT THERE OF. AND CREATING A NEW OFFICE OF THE ARM BUT IT'S PERSON TO ENSURE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE NEW DEPARTMENT RECEIVED A CONFIDENTIAL FULL AN IMPARTIAL REVIEW. RESOLUTION ADDITIONALLY THE DEPARTMENT IS REQUESTING TO CONSOLIDATE ITS STATE CORPORATIONS FUND AND THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS FUND. AND THEREBY CREATE A NEW FINANCIAL PROTECTION FUND. FINALLY TO CAPTURE THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT CURRENT AND FUTURE ROLE ITS NAME WILL AGAIN BE CHANGED COMPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL PROTECTION INNOVATION. THE UPDATED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE CLARIFIES WHO WILL BE COVERED BY THE NEW REGISTRATION PROVISIONS. THE PROPOSAL DOES NOT COVER OTHER AGENCY LICENSEES ACTING WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THEIR LICENSE. AND MOST OF THE PROPOSAL DOES NOT TOUCH EXISTING DEPARTMENTAL LICENSEES. FURTHERMORE THE PROPOSAL DOESN'T CREATE NEW LEGAL STANDARDS GOVERNING BEHAVIOR OF EXISTING LICENSEES. YOU UNFORTUNATE STRATEGIES YES BUT THERE ARE NO UNDERLYING NEW LEGAL STANDARDS. THE PROPOSAL WOULD REQUIRE THE REGISTRATION OF NEW COVERED PERSONS WHICH WILL PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED OVERSIGHT INTO I'M LICENSED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WHILE HELPING TO FURNISH NEW INFORMATION ABOUT THESE ON REGULATED INDUSTRIES. YEAH WILL HELP THE DEPARTMENT TO PROTECT CONSUMERS AND WILL HELP INFORM THE LEGISLATURE TO DECIDE WHICH INDUSTRIES NEED ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS. SOME THOUGH THIS PROPOSAL WAS IMPORTANT IN JANUARY IT IS ALL THE MORE CRITICAL TODAY. NEW PRODUCTS NEW ACTORS NEW SCHEMES WILL POP UP AS UNSCRUPULOUS ENTITIES LOOK TO EXPLOIT. CONSUMERS DESPERATION. IN FACT WE'VE ALREADY STARTED SANTA AND WE'RE NOT EVEN A FULL QUARTER INTO THIS CRISIS. NO QUESTION IN MY MIND D. B. O. WILL BE DEALING WITH THE NEGATIVE ASPECTS OF THIS ONGOING FINANCIAL CRISIS FOR SOMETIME TO COME. GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL PROACTIVELY REFINES THE TOOLS NEEDED TO BAN THE FINANCIAL DISTRESS KERR. WE DON'T ENACTED NOW I WORRY WE'RE GOING TO LOOK BACK MONTHS FROM NOW REGRETTING THAT WE DIDN'T DO MORE SOONER. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I HOPE YOU WILL SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD. YEAH YES I'M SURE WE WOULD LIKE TO- ADDRESS THE ELLIE IS ONLY OWES RECOMMENDATION THAT THIS BE MOVED TO A POLICY COMMITTEE WE THINK IT BELONGS IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE BECAUSE IT IS A SUBSTANTIAL COMMITMENT OF PERSONNEL AND DOLLARS FOR THIS PROJECT AND ALSO- WITH ALL STATE WOULD DELAY THE IMPLEMENTATION BECAUSE ALL SICK MANY COME BACK HERE WITH EASY THING AND THEN HIRING STAFF AND WRAPPING UP THE PROGRAM AND ITS MISSION I JUST MENTIONED. TO START. SUPER THE WORK. BOB KELLY ON. THANK YOU CHAIR ASKED WE RECOMMEND AS YOU HEARD FROM FINANCE- THAT THIS PROPOSAL BE HEARD THAT THE POLICY PROCESS RECOMMENDED APPROACH BOTH BECAUSE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REALLY KEY POLICY QUESTIONS THAT ARE INVOLVED THIS IS- THE SIGNIFICANT KIND OF CHANGE FOR THE DEPARTMENT AND WE THINK THAT THERE'S NOT MUCH TIME IN THIS PARTICULARLY- IN THERE'S ALWAYS A COMPRESSED TIMEFRAME- THE BUDGET PROCESS BUT PARTICULARLY THIS YEAR AS AS YOU ALL KNOW THERE'S A VERY COMPRESSED TIME. PROJECT HAND. PROCESS I'M SO WE THINK AFTER THOSE POLICY DECISIONS ARE MADE IT WE THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE THEN TO PROVIDE THE LEVEL OF FINDING THAT COMMENSURATE WITH WHATEVER THOSE CHANGES ARE. SO THAT MIGHT NEED ADJUSTING THE LEVEL OF FUNDING THAT'S BEING PROPOSED CURRENTLY IF THE LEGISLATURE TAKES A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT OPTIONS BEING UP. AND PROPOSE CURRENTLY BY THE ADMINISTRATION. SO WE THINK THAT- REALLY IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET IT RIGHT I'M IN SO DOING IT TO THAT PROCESS ONE WILL HELP ENSURE THAT THAT'S THE CASE AND HELP ENSURE THAT THE RIGHT FUNDING LEVEL. IS ALSO PROVIDED I'M AND OF COURSE THERE'S ALWAYS- YOU KNOW OPTIONS FOR EXAMPLE BUDGET BILL JUNIOR. IF FUNDING IS TO BE EXPEDITED. THE KIND OF THINGS THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED A LEGISLATURE INTERESTED IN DOING THAT. ALSO WE JUST KNOW THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT FUNDING IS PROVIDED IN THE BUDGET YEAR WE HAVE WE DO RECOMMEND SOME TWEAKS. I'M ONE OF THEM IS THAT WE THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD REJECT FUNDING FOR POSITIONS THAT ARE NOT NEEDED IN THE BUDGET YEAR SO. THIS FAR AS FINDING A PROPOSAL NOT ONLY REQUIRED REQUEST FUNDING FOR POSITIONS THAT ARE NEEDED STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. BUT ALSO SOME POSITIONS THAT DON'T- DON'T START INTEL FUTURE YEARS SO MAYBE THEY'RE NOT NEEDED UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AND SO WE THINK THAT POINT. THE LEGISLATURE CAN EVALUATE WHAT NEEDS ARE OF THE PROGRAM THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY GIVEN THAT ITS NEW PROGRAM SO. JUST JUST FINDING THE ONES THAT WOULD BE NEEDED- AND THAT AND EIGHT YEAR IF YOU WERE TO TAKE THAT APPROACH. AND ALSO THAT SOME TYPES OF ACTIVITY SHOULD BE FUNDED. ON A LIMITED TERM PILOT BASIS SO AT AS WAS MENTIONED THERE ARE SOME NEW FOR EXAMPLE YOU ON. YOUR PROPOSES AS PART OF THIS PROPOSAL. REALLY AND THERE'S SOME UNCERTAINTY BACK IN. THOSE NEW OFFICES SO WRITING LIMITED FUNDING FOR THOSE. HERE IN THIS ACTIVITY LEVEL LEGISLATURE BACK IN A FEW YEARS ASSESS WHETHER THEY'VE BEEN EFFECTIVE OR WHETHER. THEY SHOULD CONTINUE. VERY GOOD AND BRING ISSUE BACK TO THE COMMITTEE HAS SATURDAY NEAR NIELSEN CHAIR HAPPEN. MY COLLEAGUES. THIS IS A- SIMILAR ISSUE THE OVER TALKING ABOUT. IN TERMS OF POLICY. JUST AS WITH POLICY THE LEGISLATURE'S SEATED STARTING THE LEGISLATURE ALSO HAS DONE SO OVER MANY YEARS. OF SEATING POLICY OF RAISING FEES. AN AFFECT TAXES ON DIFFERENT ENTITIES LICENSEES ETCETERA. WERE BY EITHER THE FEE FOR THE TAX IF YOU WILL CALL IT THAT WOULD BE IMPOSED BY THE DEPARTMENT. VIA UP ON A MEDICAL ONE INDEX TO SOME PARTICULAR FACTOR. BUT JUST BY VI&lt;c.cyan&gt;. BY THEIR OWN VOLITION&lt;/c&gt; RAISING THE FEES AND OR THE APPLICATION OF THE UNIVERSE THOSE FEES WERE IMPOSED ON. THAT IS A VERY COMMON PRACTICE NOW AND AS WE APPROACH APPROACH THIS PARTICULAR AREA I THINK WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF THAT ASPECT TOO THANK MANAGER. IMAGE. WELL LET ME LET ME JUST SAY THAT. BUT I MEAN APPRECIATE THE. THE INTEREST IN PROTECTING THE PUBLIC DURING THIS DIFFICULT PANDEMIC I MEAN I THINK WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT. THE PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND THAT'S WHEN THE. THE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE. OF THE SITUATION COME OUT BEYOND- START PRAYING ON ON INDIVIDUALS BUT- MY A GUT REACTION QUITE FRANKLY IS THAT THE WAY TO DO. A REORGANIZATION OF THE DEPARTMENT IS TO DO IT THROUGH THE REORGANIZATION PROCESS THAT WE HAVE. EITHER THROUGH LEGISLATION OR THROUGH THE RE ORGANIZATION PROCESS THAT. OUR THAT REQUIRES YOU TO PUT IT IN WRITING AND TAKE IT THROUGH THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION- THAT WAY EVERYBODY GETS A CHANCE TO SEE WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT WHO'S GOING TO BE AFFECTED. WHAT WHAT ARE THE- WITHIN THE PARAMETERS OF THE EXPANSION OF THE DEPARTMENT THIS IS FAIRLY EXTENSIVE- IT'S- IT IS ABOUT WALKING INTO AN AREA THAT HAS- SOME ISSUES THAT I THINK MANY OF US WANT TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT BETTER EXACTLY HOW IT WOULD WORK- I ALSO. I HAVE- IT RECEIVE SOME CONCERN IN REGARDS TO. THE LANGUAGE AND IT THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY. IN DOING A BILL- DURING THE REORGANIZATION PROCESS IS REAL IMPORTANT WHEN YOU SEE IT IN WRITING AND YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO RESPOND BUT- IN PARTICULAR SB TWELVE THIRTY FIVE THAT WAS PASSED A- THE- LAST TWO YEARS AGO- IN IT'S THE TRUTH IN FINANCING WHICH HAS PROTECTIONS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. AND THE TRAILER BILL- CHANGES SOME OF THE LANGUAGE AND- AND IT FUNDAMENTALLY HANGES THE LEGISLATION THAT WAS PASSED BECAUSE IT IT CHECK IT USES NEW DEFINITIONS AND- AND IT IT THAT. THE IT THE BILL AS IT WAS PASSED ALLOWS ROLL MAKING SIMILAR TO THE DODD FRANK- AB FEDERAL LEGISLATION SO- SO PART OF THE CHALLENGES MAKING SURE THAT. THAT WHATEVER LANGUAGE THAT IS ADOPTED REALLY FITS IN WITH THINGS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS SUPPORTED IN THE PAST SO HAVING SAID THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE ITEMS THAT. IT IS RECOMMENDED TO BE WHOLE HELD OPEN I THINK THERE'S MORE DISCUSSION ON THIS IT MAY BE THAT. THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S A WAY TO BE ABLE TO GET TO YES THAT THE ADMINISTRATION- APPRECIATE THE CAN CAN APPRECIATE AND THAT ALLOWS THE LEGISLATURE TO KNOW EXACTLY WHERE WE'RE CBO. IS GOING TO GO ON THIS BUT- I REALLY FEEL STRONGLY THAT- THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DO A REORGANIZATION AS A BUDGET ITEM- UNLESS IT'S FAIRLY FAIRLY MODEST IN. AND SMALL. AS WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY ASK QUESTIONS SO THAT WILL REMAIN OPEN AND I'M SURE WILL WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK SOME MORE ABOUT THAT- AND I APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR. FOR COMING IN AND GIVING US- THE WISDOM OF DOING THIS. THIS CHANGE AT THIS TIME. WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO THE DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION AND ITS ISSUE TWO HUNDRED AND ONE WHICH IS THE USED CAR DEALER SALES TAX AND PRIVATE PARTY VEHICLE SALES VALUATION. WILL TURN IT OVER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON SENATORS HUNDRED CHAMBERLAIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SO ISSUE TO ALL ONE CONTAINS TWO MAY REVISED GOALS. BOTH OF WHICH ARE AIMED AT MAKING A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE EXISTING TAX GAP FROM THE SALES OF USING. THE FIRST PROPOSAL OF WOULD REQUIRE USE USE VEHICLE DEALERS TREATMENT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES. APPLICABLE SALES TAX MEASURE BY THE SALES PRICE. ALL ALONG WITH ALONG SAME TIME FOR YOU- SUBMIT THE REGISTRATION FEE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES. THIS REQUIREMENT WOULD BE EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SO YOU USE MOTOR VEHICLES ARE REQUIRED TO REGISTER CURRENTLY ARE REQUIRED TO REGISTER VEHICLES WITH A PARTNER MOTOR VEHICLES. AND PAY THE REGISTRATION FEE WHEN TO USE CARS SOLD. SEPARATELY THE USED VEHICLE DEALERS ARE REQUIRED REPORT. SALEM AND REMIT SALES TAX CALIFORNIA TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF. OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION WHEN THE WHEN THE TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENT RECEIVES DATA. OTHER THEY RECEIVE DATA FROM THE DMV ON VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS QUARTERLY THEY'VE USE THAT DATA TO ESTIMATE THE VALUE VEHICLES SOLD BASED ON THE DMV'S REGISTRATION FEE SCHEDULES. CTF REYES ANALYSIS TO SHOW THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT. GET OUT OF BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF SALES TAX PAID ON USED CAR SALES AND THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE EXPECTED TO BE PAID BASED ON THE DMV'S REGISTRATION DATA. THIS TAX CAP CONSIST BOTH OF SALES BY DEALERS WHO DO NOT HAVE ACTIVE SOLDIERS FROM THAT. AND INTENTIONAL AND REPORTING OF THE SALES VALUE OF THE VEHICLES. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD THE PROPOSAL IS REQUIRED USE MOTOR VEHICLE THE DEALERS TREATMENT THE POLITICAL SALES TAX ALONG WITH REGISTRATION FEES TO THE DMV WITHIN THIRTY DAYS FROM THE DATE OF SALE. IT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THE ENVY. OUR TO WITHHOLD REGISTRATION OF VEHICLES PURCHASED FROM USED OF VEHICLE. IN OUR PAYS TO THE DMV SALES TAX- AS MEASURED BY THE SALES PRICE. THIS PROPOSAL IS ESTIMATED TO BRING AND- TWELVE pABOUT TWENTY FOUR MILLION PER YEAR THEREAFTER. SO THE SECOND PROPOSAL. YOU WOULD REQUIRE THAT THERE ARE THAT THERE BE A- WHEN THERE IS A PRIVATE SALE OF A OF A VEHICLE VALUE OF THE VEHICLE CAN'T BE BELOW CERTAIN LEVEL TO ORDER CURRENT LAW. ON THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION CONTRACTS WITH THE DMV TO COLLECT USED TAX FOR THE VEHICLE PURCHASERS ON PRIVATE PRIVATE PARTY SALES. EAGLE PURCHASERS ARE REQUIRED TO PAY THIS TAX TO THE DMV WHEN THEY REGISTER THE VEHICLE. USE TAX PAID IS BASED ON THE SELF REPORTED SALES PRICE OF THE VEHICLE. AN AMOUNT THAT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE CD GFA TO VERIFY. ANALYSIS BY THE CD TFA SUGGEST THAT THE SELF REPORT. AND THEN READ UNDER REPORTED ALLOWING THE PURCHASER TO AVOID TAX AND FEE LIABILITY ON THE PURCHASE. DMV DATA INDICATES A PRIVATE PARTY VEHICLE SALES SALES PRICES ARE ABOUT 33% LOWER ON AVERAGE IN SOME MORE CARS SOLD THROUGH A DEALER. UNDER THIS PROPOSAL WHEN THERE IS A PRIVATE PARTY SALE OF THE VEHICLE THE VALUE OF THE VEHICLE WOULD BE SET AT THE GREATER OF THE STATED VEHICLE SALES PRICE SO THE SELF REPORTED SALES PRICE FOR EIGHTY PERCENT. OF THE VEHICLES PRESUMPTIVE VALUE. THE PRESUMPTIVE VALUE IS DEFINED AS HAS HE EITHER THE KELLEY BLUE BOOK VALUE OR SOME OTHER SIMILAR MOTOR VEHICLE GUIDE AS AS PRESCRIBED BY THE DMV. IF THE ACTUAL VALUE OF THE VEHICLES LOWER THAN THE 80% OF THRESHOLD THEN THE PURCHASER WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE DMV WITH A CERTIFIED APPRAISAL OF VALUE IN THE CAR THE LOWER VALUE WITHIN TWENTY DAYS OF THE DATE. THIS PROPOSAL IS ESTIMATED TO BRING IN THIRTY MILLION IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND SIXTY ONE MILLION THEREAFTER. THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS. HI I'M I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ALSO MENTION THAT SHE DID YOU HAVE A STAFF IS ALSO AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS. VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH HELLO. WELCOME. I'M SURE BROWN YOU ARE WITH THE LA- WE'RE CONCERNED HAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL ON PRIVATE PARTY SALES WOULD PLACE ON REASONABLE BURDENS ON MANY COMPLAINED TAXPAYERS BY REQUIRING THEM EITHER OVER PAY USE TAX SORT OF ENCOURAGE THE HASSLE AND EXPENSE OF ATTAINING A CERTIFIED APPRAISAL AND SUBMITTING IT TO. THE AND THE THIS WOULD OCCUR BECAUSE THE PROPOSAL DOES NOT ADEQUATELY ACCOUNT FOR VARIATION AND LEGITIMATE USED CAR SALE PRICES. YES PROVIDED MY STANDARD VEHICLE GUIDES LIKE THE KELLEY BLUE BOOK AND CRUCIALLY ON INFORMATION NINETEEN BE DOES NOT COLLECT. SUCH AS THE CONDITION OF THE VEHICLE AND EVEN IF THE ANTI COLLECTED MORE DETAIL INFORMATION ABOUT VEHICLES WE SAYING. THAT MANY LEGITIMATE SALES PRICE IS STILL LIKELY WOULD FALL. RUSSELL PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. BECAUSE OF THESE CONCERNS AND GIVEN THE LEGISLATURE'S WANTED TIME TO DEVELOP AN ALTERNATIVE TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS BEFORE BUDGET MUST BE ADOPTED. WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THE MISTER THE PORTION OF THE MINISTRATIONS FOR POLLS ARE RELATED TO OUR SALES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- BRING THE MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. ANY COMMENTS. CENTER NIELSEN ONLY THAT THIS MAKES MY POINT THAT WAS FORMALLY EMPHASIZED HERE THIS IS ANOTHER QUANTUM LEAP. WELL THIS IS AN ITEM THAT IS- THERE IS SLATED FOR A HOLD OPEN AND I WHILE I APPRECIATE THE THIS REALLY HAS TWO SECTIONS ONE WHICH IS A USED CAR DEALER SALES TAX. AND THEN THE OTHER PART WHICH IS A PRIVATE PARTY VEHICLE SALES- I SAID I SUPPORT THE USED CAR DEALER SALES TAX PORTION OF THE- OF THE PROPOSAL I JUST HAVE A REAL I HAVE HEARTBURN OVER THE PRIVATE. PARTY VEHICLE SALES BECAUSE IT MAKE SOME ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT PRIVATE PARTY SALES- A SALE OF A- USED CAR FROM ONE PERSON TO THE NEXT AND QUITE FRANKLY- THE INDIVIDUALS ATTENDED DO THESE KINDS OF SALES ARE PEOPLE WHO CAN AFFORD TO GO INTO A NEW DEALERSHIP AND BUY A CAR. AND SO IT IT IT- GETS ITS LOWER CLASS LOWER INCOME AND MET- MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES THAT ARE ARE- ARE SELLING CARS AND TO. UP REQUIRE THAT- DO IT TO SET UP THE PROCESS TO TRY TO GET THEM TO PAY THE HIGHER. THE HIGHER. TAX JUST SEEMS TO ME TO BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE AND SO- I DON'T I DON'T FEEL REAL COMFORTABLE WITH THAT BUT- I THINK IT HIT THE POOR PEOPLE DISPROPORTIONATELY BUT- BUT THE OTHER PART I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH. THIS ISN'T- A HOLD OPEN ITEM AND SO I'M WILL SIT BACK FROM BUT BUT I DO HAVE THAT INVITES ME TO ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. THAT CARE YES- YOU CONVINCE ME. I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU AND I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT. I'M NOT THOUGHT OF IT THAT WAY THANK YOU I APPRECIATE. SENATOR RUSSELL SO WE'LL SEE IT BACK TO WILL IT MEAN SOME GEYSER- ANOTHER- AT AT COMMITTEE MEMBERS WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO OH TWO WHICH IS THE VAPING TAX AND WILL TURN THE MATTER OVER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GOOD AFTERNOON CALL THE WHITE PART OF FINANCE- IN NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA VOTERS PASSED PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX WHICH RAISE THE TAX ON CIGARETTE AND TOBACCO PRODUCTS. AND ALSO CATEGORIZE THE CIGARETTES. THE TOBACCO PRODUCTS FOR THE FIRST TIME. I BUT AS A RESULT THESE VAPE PRODUCTS ARE CURRENTLY TAXED AT ADDRESS THE SURGEON USE A DATING PRODUCTS BY YOU. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ESTABLISH A WEEK BASED TAX ON NICOTINE. ON THE CIGARETTE BABY PRODUCTS THAT ARE BETTER RATE OF ONE DOLLAR FOR TWENTY MILLIGRAMS OF NICOTINE AND THIS IS A NEW TAX IN ADDITION TO THE EXISTING TAX. THIS NEW TAX WILL TAXI SERVICE MORE SIMILAR RATE IMPOSSIBLE CIGARETTES BASED ON NICOTINE DELIVERY. E. CIGARETTES DELIVER NICOTINE USERS MUCH MORE EFFICIENTLY AND INEXPENSIVELY THE COMBUSTIBLE CIGARETTES AND THEREFORE THE EXISTING TAXES NOT PROPORTIONAL IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH ARE. ALL REVENUES REYES PURSUING THIS PROPOSAL WOULD GO INTO A NEWLY ESTABLISHED SPECIAL FINE AND IT WOULD BE USED FOR ADMINISTRATION ENFORCEMENT AND THIS. FOR GROWTH AND MEDICAL COSTS. I AT WILL ALSO NOW BE SUBJECT NOW THIS THIS CIGARETTE STAMPING. WHICH IS FIXING ON PRODUCTS GENDER THAT THE TAXES EIGHT. TAXES DISTRIBUTOR LEVEL AND THEN PASSED ON TO THE CONSUMER IN THE FINAL RETAIL PRICE STANCE WILL BE AFFIXED BASED ON THAT TEARS OF TWENTY MILLIGRAMS OF NICOTINE CONTENT CONTAINED WITHIN THE CAR. BY THIS NEW TAX ID SAY THAT TO RAISE THIRTY THREE MILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND A FIFTY MILLION. THE FOLLOWING YEAR- GIVEN THAT THIS IS A NEW TAXES- THE ELECTRONIC CIGARETTE MRKET IS ALSO IN THE STATE OF MAJOR FLOCKS. OF THESE REVENUE ESTIMATES ARE SUBJECT TO CONSIDERABLE ANSWER. AND I THINK WITH MY REMARKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE LA. BROWN YOU BRING YOU ARE AGAIN FROM THE ALLEY- BACK IN FEBRUARY OFFICE RELEASED A REPORT ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO TAX THE CIGARETTES. SEVERAL FINDINGS TO STAR OUR REVIEW OF THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE SUGGESTED THAT. PROPOSED TAX LIKELY WOULD REDUCE BOTH USE AND ALL THE CIGARETTE USE SUBSTANTIALLY. AND ALTHOUGH THE TAX LIKELY WOULD INCREASE ADULTS CIGARETTE SMOKING- IF LEGISLATURE DOES WISH TO ENACT NEW TAX ON CIGARETTES THE PROPOSED NICOTINE BASED TAX STRUCTURE. IS REASONABLE WITH THAT SAID THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOT PROPOSE A COMPELLING ARGUMENT FOR THE RATE THAT FOR. YOU THE SELECTION OF AN APPROPRIATE. TAX RATE INVOLVES A NUMBER OF CONSIDERATIONS. COVER DETAIL BUT THEY JUST FOR IN YOUR IN AND FOR THE DISCUSSED IN OUR FROM YOUR WORK- REGARDLESS OF WHAT RATE IS SELECTED ASSURE THE LEGISLATURE MOVE FORWARD WITH THE TAX WE RECOMMEND. INDEXING THE TAX RATE TO INFLATION AND REVISITING THE RATE. FREQUENTLY WE ALSO RECOMMEND. CRISIS FLEXIBILITY- IDEALLY THIS WOULD MEAN DEPOSITING THE REVENUE. IN THE GENERAL FUND INSTEAD OF CREATING A NEW SPECIAL. FINALLY AS OUR COMMENTS SUGGEST HE CIGARETTE TAXATION INVOLVES SEVERAL COMPLEX POLICY DECISIONS I'M FOR THE MORE THE PROJECTED REVENUES NOT LARGE ENOUGH TO MAKE A MAJOR DIFFERENCE IN THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE BUDGET. BECAUSE OF THIS WE SUGGEST FELIZ LEISURE CONSIDER DEFERRING THIS PROPOSAL TO A LATER DATE WHEN IT HAS MORE TIME TO CAREFULLY CONSIDER ALL SEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH BRINGING THE MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY COMMENTS OR CONCERNS. I DO I DO HAVE A OF A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN- THIS IS ONE OF THOSE ITEMS THAT IS A HOLDOVER OPEN ITEM BUT I HAVE LET ME JUST SAY THAT I SUPPORT THE CONCEPT- NICOTINE IS NICOTINE AND SO I THINK IT IT- THAT THE MORE THAT WE CAN- REDUCE THE USE AND PART OF THE WAY YOU DO THAT IS BY IMPLEMENTING A TAX ON IT WE HAVE A TAX ON CIGARETTES I THINK WE SHOULD DO IT. FOR THIS AS WELL HOWEVER THE PROPOSAL BECAUSE IT IS A ACTUALLY IT WHETHER IT'S IN THE BUDGET OR NOT THERE'D STILL BE A CONTROVERSY IT'S- IT'S OVER THE DETAILS AND I'VE TALKED WITH THE NUMBER OF THE STAKEHOLDERS AND I THINK THERE'S A SWEET SPOT TO GET THERE BUT THE- THE THAT. THE WHOLE DISCUSSION ABOUT POINT OF SALE VERSUS THE DISTRIBUTOR AND THEN THIS THE SPECIAL FIND. I HAS GIVE ME SOME HEARTBURN I THINK IT SHOULD GO IN THE REVENUE SHOULD GO INTO THE GENERAL FUND AND WE SUPPORT. YOUTH HEALTH FUN ACTIVITIES IF YOU KNOW BECAUSE THAT IS A PRIORITY- BUT WE ALSO WE ALSO FIND FIRST FIVE THROUGH OUR CIGARETTE TAX AND SO IF WE'RE GOING TO PUT IT INTO A SPECIAL FUND PART OF THE MONEY SHOULD GO IN THE FIRST FIVE BECAUSE THAT'S- THAT'S SEEN DECLINING REVENUES BECAUSE OF THE- OF THE SHIFT. TO OTHER SUBSTANTIVE SUBSTANCES BUT I DO THINK THERE IS. THERE THERE IS- EIGHTY AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE SOME CONSISTENCY WITH THE CIGARETTE TAX. AND TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT THAT IS NOT- A HUGE BURDEN ON- EITHER. THE DISTRIBUTORS OR THAT THE RETAIL OUTLETS- A LOT OF THESE ARE SOLD AT THE- MOMENT POP STORES AND SO TO MAKE THEM RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME OF THIS DOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE A LOT OF SENSE SO. THIS IS A HOLD OPEN I WOULD ITEM IF THERE'S NO OTHER A COMMENT- WITH WITH THAT- I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THERE IS INTERESTED INTEREST IN SITTING DOWN AND- AMONG THE INDUSTRY SITTING DOWN AND WORKING OUT THE DETAILS AND I'D LIKE TO. I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT HAPPEN IF THAT'S POSSIBLE. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS DISCUSSION- MOVE ON TO THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD WHICH IS ISSUE NUMBER TWO OH THREE NET OPERATING LOSSES SUSPENSION AND BUSINESS TAX CREDIT LIMITATION BUT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IT UP FOR THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD IF THEY'RE AVAILABLE. WELCOME HI HI INDUSTRY JAMES SPARKMAN FINANCE. SO FOR ISSUE TWO OR THREE THERE'S STILL MORE. CALLS AGAIN THIS IN THEIR SUPER BOWLS IN THIS ISSUE. PART OF THE BALANCED APPROACH TO CLOSING THE BUDGET GAP. NO WAS CAUSED BY THE CUP IN NINETEEN RECESSION MAY REVISED BUDGET PROPOSES TO. TEMPER TEMPORARILY RAISE TAXES ON LARGER BUSINESSES- AND TO DO IT THROUGH A TWO MEANS SO THE FIRST APPROACH IS TO SUSPEND THE USE OF NET OPERATING LOSSES- OUT FOR BUSINESSES WITH INCOME IN EXCESS OF A MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE FOR THE YEAR TWENTY. AND ONE IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THE SUSPENSION APPLIES TO BOTH THE APPROACH WE CAN TAX TAXPAYERS INCORPORATION TAX PAYERS AND IT IS ESTIMATED TO RAISE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION IN OF THE BUDGET YEAR ONE POINT THREE BILLION IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND FOUR HUNDRED MILLION IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY. THIS IS. CORPORATE NET OPERATING LOSSES FOR TAX PURPOSES IF THEIR ALLOWABLE DEDUCTIONS AND LOSSES EXCEED THEIR TAXABLE INCOME. TWO HUNDRED CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW TAXPAYERS ARE ALLOWED TO USE NO OPERATING LOSSES FROM PRIOR YEARS ALSO YOU ALL SET UP TO A ACTORS ARE ALLOWED TO CARRY FORWARD NOT OPERATING LOSSES FOR UP TO TWENTY YEARS IN THE YEAR THAT THE LOSSES INCURRED. CALIFORNIA DOES NOT ALLOW ANIMAL THAT IT CURRENTLY DOES NOT ALLOW ANIMALS TO BE CARRIED BACK TOSS IT IN CAN PRIOR YEARS. THE AMOUNT OF NET OPERATING LOSSES USE AND THE NUMBER OF TAXPAYERS. LOSSES CAN VARY FROM YEAR TO YEAR BUT FROM TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE NUMBER OF CORPORATIONS CLAIMING THAT- WELLS ARE NOT OPERATING LOSSES HAS AVERAGED OVER A HUNDRED FORTY FOUR THOUSAND PER YEAR AND THE AMOUNT. OF ANIMALS CLAIMED HAS AVERAGED OVER TWENTY NINE BILLION. ARE SIGNIFICANT ANIMALS CLAIMS ON THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX SIDE AS WELL. SINCE THE SUSPENSION OF THAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS LIMITED TO TAXPAYERS WITH INCOME OVER ONE MILLION IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE MAJORITY. WILL STILL BE ALLOWED THE FULL EXTENT OF THEIR CURRENT LAW NOT ALREADY LOST YOU DIRECTIONS BUT THE AMOUNT OF DEDUCTIONS CLAIMED IS EXPECTED TO DROP SIGNIFICANTLY. TAXPAYERS WHO HAVE OF WHO DO HAVE THE RENTAL SUSPENDED WILL BE ALLOWED TO CARRY FORWARD THEIR ANIMALS FOR AN ADDITIONAL THREE YEARS BEYOND THE TWENTY YEAR CARRY OVER LIMIT ALLOWED UNDER CURRENT LAW. IT IS EXPECTED THAT MUCH OF THE SUSPENDED NOT OPERATING LOSSES WILL EVENTUALLY BE YEARS. THE SECOND PROPOSAL- WOULD TEMPERATURE TEMPORARILY LIMIT THE USE OF BUSINESS INSTEAD OF TAX CREDITS SO THAT THEY WOULD ALL SAID NO MORE THAN FIVE MILLION IN TAX LIABILITY. IS PENSION APPLIES TO BOTH PERSONAL INCOME TAX CORPORATION TAXPAYERS IN THE NEST AND IS ESTIMATED TO RAISE. TWO BILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND NINE HUNDRED MILLION IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BUSINESS BUSINESSES REDUCE THEIR CORPORATE TAX LIABILITY BY OVER TWO POINT NINE BILLION THROUGH THE USE OF CREDITS WITH TWO POINT FOUR BILLION COMING FROM THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDIT. BUSINESS THIS IS CHRIS USE ON THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX SIDE ARE MUCH SMALLER BUT STILL SIGNIFICANT. THE PROVISION OF THIS PROVISION WOULD LIMIT CREDIT USAGE TO FIVE MILLION PER YEAR. STRUCTURED AS A DOLLAR LIMIT HOWEVER IT WOULD PROVIDE A DEFINITE PROTECTION TO SMALL FOR TO SMALLER FIRMS FOR WHOM FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN CREDIT. IS GENERALLY CAN BE MORE THAN SUFFICIENT. IN ADDITION LIMITATION ALL EFFECTS BUSINESS INSTEAD OF INSTEAD OF CRITICISM DOESN'T AFFECT THE- PERSONAL GESTURE CRITICS SAY HE ID SO THAT'S- FINALLY TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY CREDIT AFFECTED BY THIS PROVISION HAS A LIMITED CARRY OVER PERIOD- THIS TRAILER BILL WOULD GRAB THAT THE KERRY OVER. FOR THAT CREDIT BE EXTENDED FOR THE NUMBER OF YEARS THAT THE CREDIT LIMIT IT. AS SUCH AS IT IS EXPECTED TO BE UP THAT MUCH OF THE CREDITS LIMITED UNDER THIS PROPOSAL WILL EVENTUALLY BE USED AND SO JUST SAID IN SOME I WOULD SAY THIS IS A- PROPOSAL THAT RAISES A LOT OF MONEY. BUT BECAUSE WE REALLY SEE THAT THIS RECESSION IS HITTING SMALLER BUSINESSES CHARTER THAN. LARGE BUSINESSES IN GENERAL WE. WANT TO. WE LIVE UP TO FIGHT A AND EXEMPTS. FROM THESE LIMITS. OF COURSE BIZ AND THESE BILLS TO THAT. SO NOT INCLUDES MY COMMENTS AND HAVE TO TAKE COMMENTS AND I ALSO WANT TO MENTION THAT- OF. FRANCHISE TAX BOARD HAS STUFF AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AS WELL. VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH COULD YOU TELL US WHAT THE LIMIT I AM I MAY HAVE MISSED THIS WHAT'S THE LIMIT FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. HOW HAVE YOU DEFINE SMALL BUSINESSES. YEAH SO FOR WITH THE END OF WORLD PROPOSAL. IF YOUR INCOME IS UNDER A MILLION DOLLARS YOU WILL NOT BE AFFECTED. BY THE- BY BY THAT AT ALL SUSPENSION FOR THE- FOR THE CREDIT LIMITATION THERE'S NO DEFINITION OF SMALL BUSINESS IT'S JUST THAT YOUR YOUR EVERYONE IS ALLOWED TO USE UP TO FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF CREDITS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HELLO. YES SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE WHICH TO INCLUDE REVENUE SOLUTIONS IN ITS PACKAGE OF ACTIONS TO ADDRESS THE BUDGET SHORTFALL WE THINK THAT THE PROPOSALS PUT FORWARD THESE PROPOSALS BEFORE BY THE ADMINISTRATION ARE REASONABLE STARTING POINT YOUR DELIBERATIONS OF THE STATE HAS TAKEN SOME MORE I. AFTER SESSIONS- AND ARE GENERALLY CONSIDERED IS LESS BURDENSOME BECAUSE THEY'RE LARGELY ACCELERATE THE TIMING AND TAX PAYMENTS. ARE WITHOUT GREATLY INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF TAXES. A OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. THAT BEING SAID THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL DOES HAVE SOME LIMITATIONS FIRST THE REVENUE THERE WOULD BE REYES FROM THESE ACTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY SO BUILDING A BUDGET THE RELY ON A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF REVENUE FROM THESE ACTIONS WOULD BE SOMEWHAT RISKY. FUNDING THIS CONCERN BASED ON OUR INITIAL REVIEW. WE THINK THE ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATES OF THE AMOUNT REVENUE RAISED TO BE TOO HIGH. ANOTHER POTENTIAL IMITATION OF THE PROPOSAL IS THAT IT WOULD ATTEMPT TO- LIMIT KNOLL SUSPENSIONS MEDIUM AND LARGE BUSINESSES BASED ON INCOME THRESHOLD BUT IT'S MY CALLING FROM THE FINANCES DESCRIBE USING AN INCOME THRESHOLD. I WOULD BE THE PERFECT WAY OF DISTINGUISHING SMALLER BUSINESSES FROM LARGER ONES. AND WE ALSO HAVE SOME CONCERN THAT THIS APPROACH COULD LEAD TO SIMILAR BUSINESSES ARE BEING TREATED DIFFERENTLY UNDER THE PROPOSAL. ALTERNATIVE HE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER CAPPING THE AMOUNT OF MOLD ADOPTIONS IT CAN BE USED IN A WAY THAT'S SIMILAR TO WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES. ON TAX RATES. VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH NUMBER GET BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY COMMENTS QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY THIS IS A COLD OPEN AND- AT THE I THINK THE KEY HERE IS THAT THERE ARE SOME ALTERNATIVES IF THE- DID THAT MAY WORK. BETTER BUT- AT THIS POINT THIS IS A HOLD OPEN SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR. FOR YOUR TESTIMONY WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO IT ISSUE NUMBER TWO OH FOUR WHICH IS THE MINIMUM FRANCHISE TAX. AND WILL TURN THE ISSUE OVER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. OKAY SO- SO THIS PROPOSAL IN THIS DAY AND THIS THIS WAS RECALLS THAT WE PROPOSED IN JANUARY- BUT GIVEN THE ROUTE THE RECESSION IT SEEMS- OF. EXTRA URGENCY FOR DOING THIS TO PROVIDE BENEFITS RIGHT SOME HELP TO SMALL BUSINESSES. SO THIS PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE STARTING OF FOR TAXABLE YEARS BEGINNING ON OR AFTER JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE AN EXEMPTION FROM THE EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLAR ANNUAL FRANCHISE TAX. BOB FOR LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS AND LIMITED LIABILITY PARTNERSHIPS UNDER CURRENT LAW. THE STATE IMPOSES AN ANNUAL MIP MINIMAL FRENCH I SECTION EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS ON EVERY CORPORATION AND STATE FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF DOING BUSINESS IN THE STATE. BUT IT DOES PROVIDE AN EXEMPTION FROM THAT FROM THAT TAX FOR CORPORATIONS IN THEIR FIRST TAX YEAR CORPORATIONS MUST EITHER PAY THE EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLAR ANNUAL MINIMUM TAX OR- OR TAX ON THEIR NET INCOME WHICHEVER IS HIGHER BUT THEY ARE AT IN THEIR FIRST YEAR THEY WERE EXEMPTED FROM THE EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS. EXISTING ALSO IMPOSES IN ANY INTEREST TAX OF EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS ON LIMITED LIABILITY. COMPANIES OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS AND LIMITED LIABILITY PARTNERSHIPS BUT THEY BUT THOSE TYPES OF BUSINESSES DO NOT HAVE ANY FIRST YEAR EXEMPTION. AND SO WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING IS TO EXTEND THE FIRST YEAR EXEMPTION THAT EXIST FOR CORPORATIONS FOR BUSINESSES THAT STRUCTURE AS CORPORATION. TO SIMILAR BUSINESSES IN THEIR FIRST YEAR IF THEY ARE STRUCTURED AS LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS AND LIMITED LIABILITY PARTNERSHIPS- COM WE THINK THAT'S EQUITABLE AND AS I SAID AND IT DID PROVIDES ADDITIONAL BENEFITS- RIGHT NOW TO SEE. ON SMALL THIS IS WHO WE NEED AND THE COST OF THIS PROPOSAL IS ESTIMATED AT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THEREAFTER. THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH HELLO. THANK YOU KNOW BY MARCH OUR OFFICE RELEASED REPORT ANALYZING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO EXPAND THE EXISTING FIRST YEAR EXEMPTION TO NON CORPORATE BUSINESSES ARE NOW ALSO STUFF BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSED EXPANSION OF THE EXEMPTION AS WELL AS THE EXISTING EXEMPTION. ON THESE CONCERNS ARE LAID OUT WELL ON YOUR AGENDA SO I WON'T GO OVER THEM IN DETAIL- OVERALL WE FOUND THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL I WOULD BE REALLY TARGETED AWAY THE CHEATING AND STATED GOAL WHICH IS TO PROMOTE SMALL BUSINESS- BECAUSE OF THIS WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THE- POSTAL. THIS IS THE ITEM IS A HOLD OPENER THERE ANY COMMENTS OR CONCERNS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE OF WILL LEAVE THIS ITEM OPEN. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION SO WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AND THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER TWO OH FIVE WHICH IS THE SMALL BUSINESS ASSISTANCE. OBVIOUSLY AN ISSUE THAT IS ON THE MINDS OF A LOT OF SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE LOOKING FOR HELP. I WILL TURN IT OVER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GOOD AFTERNOON JOHN FITZPATRICK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. IN APRIL FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WAS TRANSFERRED USING CONTROL SECTION THIRTY SIX TO THE SMALL BUSINESS FINANCE CENTER. PROGRAM FOR USE IN THE AREA- PROVIDING LOAN GUARANTEES TO ENTITIES THAT WOULD NOT QUALIFY FOR FEDERAL DISASTER LOAN GUARANTEES OUR LOANS. THAT INCLUDES ENTITIES OF LOW INCOME AND ON DOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT STATUS. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ADD ANOTHER FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO THAT OVERALL FUNDING AND EXPAND THE USE OF THE ORIGINAL FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR BROADER LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAMS BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT THAT MANY ENTITIES WELL ELIGIBLE FOR LOAN FEDERAL LOAN DISASTER RELIEF FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE'RE UNABLE TO AT LEAST TO DATE ACCESS A GOOD NUMBER OF THOSE. FUNDS IF YOU HAVE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT REPRESENTATIVES ON THE AYE BANKER AVAILABLE TODAY AND- THAT WILL TAKE SOME QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE LA. WE DON'T HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ON THE SITE AND WE WOULD JUST REITERATE- THE STAFF COMMENTS IN YOUR AGENDA THAT IN YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS ADDITIONAL FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR. LEGISLATURE TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF PROVIDE INFORMATION ON HOW OF THE FIRST FIFTY NOT AND HAS BEEN ALLOCATED FOR. EXCELLENT QUESTION EXCELLENT QUESTION EVERY BACK TO THE COMMITTEE- ANY COMMENTS OR CONCERNS MATTERS HERE I COULD HAVE THAT QUESTION ANSWERED ABSOLUTELY. IT DA M. THE QUESTION IS- TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE QUESTION IS WHETHER YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON HOW THE- FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE PRE THIS BOB. THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY GRANTED HAVE THAT THAT WENT TO AND INFORMATION ON HOW THAT DISTRIBUTION WENT. IT APPARENTLY THE- BANK STUFF FOR NOT ON THIS CALL I KNOW THAT ISSUE WAS DISCUSSED WITH STAFF- RECENTLY A MAJORITY OF THE FUNDING HAS NOT BEEN PROVIDED TO ENTITIES AND I REMEMBER FROM THE CONVERSATION- IN SOME INSTANCES A FUNCTION OF. SO MANY. PROGRAMS IN SO MANY MOVING PARTS ARE TAKING RESOURCES AWAY FROM- PROVIDING FULL INTENTION TO ANY PARTICULAR PROGRAM AT THIS POINT AS WELL AS THE FACT THAT SOME OF THESE ENTITIES STRUGGLE WITH PROVIDING THE DOCUMENTATION NECESSARY. FOR THE ENTITIES THAT DO- FINALLY MAKE THE FINAL DECISION ON PROVIDING THE LOANS- AND HAVE HAD SOME CHALLENGES FROM THAT RESPECT BUT THAT IT WAS THE EXPECTATION OF THE PART ON THE PART OF THE AYE BANK. THAT AS TIME GOES BY THAT. THE FULL AMOUNT WILL BE RELEASED AND IT WASN'T. EXPECTED THAT THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING WOULD REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY PROVIDED TO OUR BETA BAILABLE FOR THE ENTITIES IN THE- ORIGINAL- CHANCE TRANSFER- RATHER IT WAS A FUNCTION OF REALIZING THAT EVEN ENTITIES THAT WERE ELIGIBLE FOR. FEDERAL DISASTER RELIEF HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS IT. SINCE DRAWS A YES CENTER FARMS JUST AS A FOLLOW UP I'M I'M NOT SURE QUITE UNDERSTAND THEN. SO FIFTY MILLION WAS WAS ALLOCATED- AND I YOU'RE ASKING FOR AN ADDITIONAL FIFTY MILLION. SO HOW DO WE JUDGE EIGHT ANY VALUE WAIT THE USE OF ANOTHER FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OBVIOUSLY I THINK IT'S- GENERALLY SPEAKING GOOD BUT HOW DO WE- HAVE THE INFORMATION HOW TO WHAT DO WE GET THE INFORMATION AS TO HOW. EFFECTIVE IT WAS AND WHAT KIND OF BUSINESSES- ACTUALLY GOT THE FUNDING HOW MANY BUSINESSES REALLY WERE ABLE TO- BENEFIT- ESPECIALLY IN THIS TIME. AND I'M SORRY- BUT THEY ABSENT SURVIVING IN SOME TECHNICAL SUPPORT ON THOSE QUESTIONS WILL CERTAINLY GET BACK TO THEM. GET BACK TO THESE COMMITTEE. HOWEVER THE ADDITIONAL FIFTY MILLION IS AGAIN A FUNCTION OF A NEXT AND UNDERSTANDING UNFOLDING AND UNDERSTANDING IN THIS IS A- RAPIDLY CHANGING ENVIRONMENT THAT EVEN NOT EVEN ENTITIES WHO WERE ORIGINALLY ELIGIBLE FOR SLATED TO RECEIVE FEDERAL DISASTER RELIEF. I HAVE HAD- STRUGGLES TO ACCESS IT- OR OR ACCESS YOU ENOUGH OF THE FUNDING SO IT THE- BROADER- FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IS THE SECOND TRANSFER WAS INTENDED TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT THERE'S A LARGE PROBLEM. WE ANTICIPATED. TELL ME JUST SIX SIX THAT THE IS REALLY A CONVERSATION WE HAVE TO HAVE WITH THE I. BANK SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE- CHALLENGES THEY FACED IN. IN IN WORKING ON THE REGIONAL FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS- DO WE HAVE A- WE HAVE SOMEBODY FROM THE I'VE BEEN HERE PERFECT TIMING. IT'S LIKE MAGIC YOU JUST APPEARED. JERRY WE CANNOT HEAR YOU I THINK YOU NEED TO BE. I NEEDED NO I CAN READ LIPS. YEAH BUT- YEAH THERE YOU GO OKAY GREAT JUST TALK LOUDER AND LOUDER YOU SORRY I WAS I WAS ON THE ENTIRE TIME HOWEVER I WAS NEEDED AND- UNABLE TO I DO MYSELF IT LOOKED LIKE IT HAD TO BE DONE FROM YOUR AND SO LET ME JUST GIVE ALL THE CONTACTS ON THE ORIGINAL FIFTY MILLION AND THIS ADDITIONAL REQUEST FOR FIFTY MILLION ON APRIL THIRD THE I. BANK RECEIVED A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION. FOR THE DISASTER RELIEF LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM ADD AT THAT TIME WE ACTIVATE THE PROGRAM THERE WAS ONE PARTICIPATING LENDER THAT WAS AVAILABLE WHICH FUNDS AT THAT TIME AND IMMEDIATELY THEY WERE SOMEWHAT OVERWHELMED PUT OUT THE ENTIRE AMOUNT THAT THEY HAD AVAILABLE IN THEIR CAPACITY WITHIN A MATTER OF ABOUT A WEEK AND A HALF AND AT THAT POINT WE HAD BEEN IN CONVERSATIONS WITH A NUMBER OF PARTICIPATING POTENTIAL FOR SPRING LENDERS AND SINCE THEN WE'VE BROUGHT FIVE HUNDRED ON. THE PLATFORM AND WE HAVE. FOR ADDITIONAL WONDERS THAT TOUGH WE HAD JUST FOR ON THE- OVER THE NEXT WEEK OR- AND SO THE- DESIRE OF THE STATE WAS AT THAT SAME. TIME TO FINAL THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY THAT WAS IN DIRE NEED RELEASED INTO THE FEDERAL DISASTER RELIEF PROGRAMS. AND SO. HE AND THE US BE IS IDLE PROGRAMS WERE AVAILABLE WE WANTED THEM TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THOSE PROGRAMS. AND AT THE SAME TIME THE CDF BUYS THAT WE HAD SOLICITED TO JOIN OUR CREEK STATEMENT ROUTE. OCT TARGET THE LOW WEALTH AND IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES THE REALLY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. WORK TRYING TO RAISE FUNDS INITIALLY. ISSUE LOANS THERE WERE TWO WAVES OF THAT AS YOU'RE AWARE OF THE SECOND WAVE STILL HAS AVAILABLE BUT WILL SOON COME TO EXPIRATION. AND WITH THAT EXPIRATION WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE TIMING WILL BE OPPORTUNE. FOR THE SHIFTING OF THE ACTIVITY. INTO OUR LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM. SO ANOTHER WAY THE PRIMARY HAS BEEN ON OTHER PROGRAMS. THE PRIORITY ONE OF THE STATE WAS TO REALLY GET GUIDE THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FEDERAL DISASTER RELIEF THAT WAS COMING THROUGH THE P. P. P. AND SQ PROGRAMS AND- THE PPA HE IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE THIS AFFORDABLE LOAN A VERY LOW INTEREST RATE. AND ONCE THAT IS EXHAUSTED WE WOULD ANTICIPATE AND ARE PREPARED FOR YOU SIGNIFICANT ACCELERATION OF THE ACTIVITY INTO OUR GUARANTEE PROGRAM JUST WANTS. THERE'S A DRAWS OF IT SO. SO HOW DO HOW DO YOU MEASURE HOW EFFECTIVE THE FUNDING WAS THE FIRST FIFTY- HOW MANY BUSINESSES WHERE WOULD KIND OF BUSINESSES- BUT YOU KNOW BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF DECIDING WHETHER ANOTHER FIFTY BILLION SHOULD OKAY DID AND FOR WHAT. WHAT DID YOU LEARN FROM IT. YES WE'VE LEARNED THAT THERE WAS VERY SIGNIFICANT THAT MAN. AND THE SIGNIFIES THAT WE'RE SEEKING TO JOIN US AS PARTICIPATING LENDERS. WORK IN A PROCESS OF FOCUSING ON. A LONG PROCESS AT THE SAME TIME IS RAISING FUNDS FOR BOTH HE PROGRAM AS WELL AS FOR DISASTER RELIEF PROGRAM HAVING SAID THAT. AS I MENTIONED THE FIRST WEEK OR TWO THERE WAS IN EXISTING BINDER ON OUR PLATFORM THAT HAD ALLOCATED CAPITAL AND DAY EXHAUSTED THAT IMMEDIATELY AND THE LAST WEEK TO TEN DAYS WE BROUGHT ON ADDITIONAL VENDORS AND SO- AS OF THIS WEEK. THE VOLUME HAS PICKED UP AGAIN SIGNIFICANTLY WE'VE NOW WILL- PUT FORTH CONDITIONALLY ABOUT THREE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS OF LOANS AND- COMPOSITION OF THOSE LOANS IT'S PRETTY AT THIS ACROSS ALL THE BEER INDUSTRY SEGMENTS. BUT NOT ONE INDUSTRY SEGMENT THAT AVAIL THEMSELVES OPPORTUNITY IS THE SERVICE INDUSTRY FOLLOWED BY HEALTHCARE SERVICES FOLLOWED BY AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES BUT IT REALLY SPANS THE GAMUT RETAIL CARE SERVICES MANUFACTURING- CONTRACTORS. AND SO WE'RE BASED ON THE SMALL SIZE PLEASE WITH THE CARPET. INDUSTRY SECTOR THATARE. WELL WHICH UNITIES. THERE IS A VERY JUST SHE- THAT ALL OF THE NUMBER ENTERPRISE.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH BRING THE MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. YEAH COMMENTS HERE- YOU MENTIONED IT- WAS MENTIONED ABOUT THE NOVEMBER ELECTION. UP ALL MAIL BALLOT ELECTION IN NOVEMBER IS GOING TO BE QUITE A CHANGE FROM WHAT EVERYBODY'S IT USED TO- AND- WHEN YOU MAKE CHANGES LIKE THAT IT'S LIKELY TO. RESULT IN- LESS VOTERS. AND AS IT IS THIS GOING TO BE THE CHALLENGE OF THE PANDEMIC AND THEN TO DO AN ALL WHEEL BY MAIL- THERE IS A AS I UNDERSTAND IT THERE'S A MINIMALLY A THIRD OF THE VOTERS HAVE NEVER VOTED BY MAIL- BY MAIL BEFORE SO- WE HAVE GOT. TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN- IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL OF THIS TO PROTECT OUR DEMOCRACY AND MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP- PROVIDING THE RESOURCES. ALL WHATEVER IT TAKES I THINK AT THE RECOMMENDATION OF. UP MORE FUNDING ONE WAY OR ANOTHER SHOULD SHOULD BE PUT INTO THIS WE NEED A LOT OF- EDUCATION. WE COULD SEE FOR EXAMPLE FROM THE CENSUS EFFORTS- THAT WE DID NOT WE HAVE NOT DONE AS AS WELL AS WE SHOULD ESPECIALLY IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE STATE SO.

BILL BUDGET BILLING WHICH IT ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE UPON NOTIFICATION TO THE JB JAIL BC TO TRANSFER FUNDS. FROM ONE FRIEND TO ANOTHER AND I DO NOTED THAT- MAY BE PROBLEMATIC I THINK THE SENT TO THE EXTENT. THAT THAT THERE WILL BE MORE DISCUSSION. ON THIS BUDGET THAT THAT MAYBE THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET THAT THAT RIGHT BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE THE MONEY IS AVAILABLE WHEN IT'S REQUIRED- AND SO I AM JUST PUTTING PUTTING A NOTE THERE- WE'RE NOT READY TO VOTE ON THIS RIGHT NOW BUT- WELL. WE WILL- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH WE'RE MOVING ON TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS CALVET AND THE IT'S ISSUE TOO TWO HUNDRED AND SIX THE CLOSURE OF BARSTOW VETERANS HOME. AND WILL. TURN THAT OVER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE UNLESS THERE'S THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS IT'S HERE. WELL THAT IS HERE JOHN YOU SPACE OR YOU LIKE TO HURT ME- ALL HAVE A COMMENT AFTERWARDS BUT IF YOU ALL WOULD LIKE TO START. SURE YEAH. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS BETH MISSION SKIING AND I'M ASSISTANT DEPUTY SECRETARY OF VETERANS HOMES FOR JOHN SO LOOKS JUST LIKE SUSAN LOOKING. YOU'RE GOING WE CAN HEAR YOU THAT YOU'RE COMING IN VERY CLEAR THANK YOU. WHITNEY IS THOMAS MARTIN DIRECTOR FUTURE OPERATIONS AND PLANNING FOR THE VETERANS HOME. THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL. DUE TO A COMBINATION OF HIS DARK CHALLENGES WE HAVEN'T STAFFING AND FILLING OUR VETERANS HOME IN BARSTOW IN THE ECONOMIC CRISIS NOW I'M ON THE STATE. CALVET IS PROPOSING CLOSING THE BAR SO LONG IN TWO YEARS. IF APPROVED WE PROJECT ONCE THE CLOSURE PROCESS IS COMPLETE IT WILL PROVIDE THE STATE APPROXIMATELY FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN SAVINGS A YEAR. FOR MANY YEARS THE BAR SO HOME HAS BEEN LESS THAN HALF FULL. IT IS DESIGNED TO BE A FOUR HUNDRED BED FACILITY AND CURRENTLY HAS APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE RESIDENTS. CALVET STUDY THIS ISSUE AS PART OF OUR COMPREHENSIVE TWENTY TWENTY MASTER PLAN WHICH WE RELEASED ABOUT FIVE MONTHS AGO. AND WE IDENTIFIED MANY FACTORS THAT ARE CHALLENGING AND CHARGE SO PRIMARILY IN STAFF RECRUITMENT REMOTENESS AND LACK OF. IN RESPONSE TO THESE FINDINGS IN GOVERNOR NEW SINCE JANUARY BUDGET YOU PROPOSE BEGINNING TO SHIFT OUR OPERATIONS AT THAT HOME OVER TIME MOVING AWAY FROM TWO LEVELS OF CARE. THAT HAVE LITTLE DEMAND AND TOWARD OUR LEVELS OF CARE THAT WILL REPRESENT ONGOING DEMAND AMONG THE- IN THE FUTURE. THIS WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A SMALLER BUDGET CAPACITY OF BANDS AT BARSTOW AND RESHAPE THE EMPHASIS OF THAT HOME THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED THROUGH ATTRITION SO WOULD HAVE TAKEN A NUMBER OF YEARS. ONE NINETEEN SAYS HAD SUCH A VAST IMPACT ON THE STATE'S ECONOMY AND THIS BILL STATUS AND SO QUICKLY. WE KNEW WE NEEDED TO TAKE A NEW LOOK AT OUR PLANS FOR THAT PROPERTY. WE BELIEVE THE BEST OPTION FOR THE STATE AND OUR OUR BARSTOW RESIDENTS WOULD BE TO ACCOMMODATE THEM AT OUR OTHER SEVEN VETERANS HOMES THAT WE HAVE. IN THE CAL THIS IS JUST CLOSE THE BAR SO LONG. SPECIFICALLY WE BELIEVE NOW IS THE TIME TO BEGIN THIS PROCESS. IN RESPONSE TO THE CODE NINETEEN AND I'M LIKE WE TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED ADMISSIONS INTO OUR VETERANS HOMES SYSTEM WIDE IN ORDER TO REDUCE INFECTION RISK IN EACH LOCATION. AS A RESULT WE HAVE A VACANCY IS IN OUR OTHER VETERANS HOMES THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO OUR BAR SO RENTS. THAT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ANOTHER TIME IN THERE ARE IN THERE ARE ANOTHER OPEN ON A NUMBER OF OTHER LOGISTICAL FACTORS LIKE THIS THAT POINT TOWARD STARTING THIS PROCESS NOW. FURTHER WE STUDIED THIS- AS PART OF AS WE DEVELOPED OUR MASTER PLAN AS I MENTIONED AND THAT INCLUDED SIGNIFICANT. SIGNIFICANT AND LIKE THE STAKEHOLDER INPUT PROCESS AND STAND TOGETHER AND RESEARCH AS WELL ON THE STOCK. THE CREW WILL SPEND THE NEXT TWO YEARS WORKING PERSON BY PERSON AND FAMILY BY FAMILY. RIGHT OPTIONS TO OUR RESIDENTS. WE FULLY EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE ALL RESIDENTS IF THEY WISH IN OUR OTHER SEVEN HOME NO ONE WILL BE DISCHARGED THE BAR SO. DUE TO THIS. NEED AMENITIES JERRY BROWN LOOKING AND OTHER FACTORS ON AN INDIVIDUAL LEVEL. WE KNOW THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR RESIDENTS WILL BE SENSITIVE AND DELICATE. THESE ARE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OUR LIVES. AFTER DECISIONS ARE MADE ABOUT WHERE THEY WISH TO MOVE WE WILL WORK ACROSS OUR SYSTEM AND WITH THEIR FAMILIES TO RE LOCATE THEM AND THEIR BELONG. FOR THE STAFF. WE WILL WORK WITH CALLIE CHART TO IDENTIFY THE OPTIONS AND AVENUES AVAILABLE TO STATE EMPLOYEES WHO THANKS THIS SORT OF CHANGE IN OUR WORKPLACES. THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR EMPLOYEES WILL SEE THEIR JOBS CONTINUE AS THEY CURRENTLY ARE FOR MOST. THROUGH MOST OR ALL OF THE TO YOUR PROCES. AS LONG AS WE HAVE RESIDENTS LIVING IN OUR BARSTOW HOME EVEN A SMALLER NUMBER OF RESIDENTS. WE WILL NEED MOSTOF OUR POSITIONS IN PLACE IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OUR PROGRAM WHERE. BELIEVE ME WHEN I TELL YOU WE DID NOT ARRIVE AT THIS DECISION EASILY AND WE DO NOT TAKE IT LIGHTLY. WE KNOW AS WELL AS ANYONE THE MAGNITUDE AND IMPACTS OF THIS PROPOSAL. AND WE ARE TAKING GREAT CARE AND HOW WE MOVE FORWARD. TO CLOSE BARSTOW IS TO CHANGE CALTRANS IDENTITY PERMANENTLY. BUT WE HAVE RESOLVED EVEN WITH GIVING OF THIS PROPERTY REST ASSURED CALIFORNIA'SDEDICATION TO ITS VETERANS REMAINS TRUE AND THE STATE INVESTMENT WILL CONTINUE TO YIELD QUALITY CARE IN HOME LIKE SETTINGS THAT PROVIDE THESE HONORABLE HEROES THE SERVICES THEY DESIRE. THANK YOU THOMAS ANSWERING THAT YOU MAY HAVE. VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. YES JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS WE'D LIKE TO KNOW THE- SO THE SAVINGS FOR THIS PROPOSALS AND EXPECTED TO MATERIALIZE UNTIL YEAR THREE AT LEAST BALK OF THAT SAVINGS- SO WE WOULD SAY THAT ANY DELAYS. IN IMPLEMENTING THE PLAN BUT CERTAINLY PUSH. ALL THE MATERIALIZATION OF THAT SAVINGS BY ANY QUOTE ROUGHLY EQUAL AMOUNT OF TIME ADDITIONALLY- AS THE DEPARTMENT NOTED- AND IRONICALLY. THE HOLD ON A MISSION OF THE OTHER HOMES CREATED AN UNEXPECTED OPPORTUNITY- AS IT RELATES TO THIS PROPOSAL AND AS IT MAY BE THAT THOSE SAVINGS COULD MATERIALIZE SOONER IN LIGHT OF THE MANY VACANCIES AT OTHER OWNS. IT BARSTOW WE'RE TO SORT OF DRAW DOWN ITS RESIDENT POPULATION FASTER THAN EXPECTED AND THE LAST POINT WE WOULD MAKE IS THAT THIS WOULD BE ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF IT HAVING BEEN NOT. IDENTIFIED AND DISCUSSED EXTENSIVELY IN THE MASTER PLAN CONSISTENT WITH THE EFFICIENCY TARGETS- THAT THE ADMISSION ADMINISTRATION HAS PUT FORTH- COURT APARTMENTS ON A STATEWIDE BASIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH HELLO. THANK YOU PRESS IT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I WAS MENTIONED BY THE DEPARTMENT- AS A PART OF THE MASTER PLAN THERE WERE A NUMBER OF LIMITATIONS IDENTIFIED ON WHAT THE BARSTOW HOME SUCH AS NOT PROVIDING THE APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF CARE THAT'S A RECOMMENDATION THAT CAME OUT OF THE MASTER PLAN WAS TO TAKE AN INCREMENTAL APPROACH AND ADDRESSING THOSE LIMITATIONS WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF EXPLORING THE OPTION OF FUTURE CLOSURE IN BARSTOW. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL MADE THAT FIRST STEP BY PROPOSING TO I'M SHIP CERTAIN CAPACITIES TO HIGHER LEVELS OF CARE THAT ARE EXPERIENCING HIGH LEVELS OF DEMAND BUT THEN RAMPING DOWN CAPACITY AND LESS- IT AND LOWER LEVELS OF CARE HOWEVER AND THIS PROPOSAL SIGNALS A SHIFT AND APPROACH AND THAT IT'S A MORE XCELERATED- ADVANCEMENT TOWARDS CLOSURE AND WHILE THE DEPARTMENT HAS MADE PROGRESS IN. EXPLORING OPTIONS AND CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THE CLOSURE PLAN WE CONCUR WITH THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION THAT- REJECTING THE MAY REVISION AND ALLOWING FOR MORE LEGISLATIVE AND THROUGH THE PROCESS AND REQUIRING THE DEPARTMENT TO ADOPT LANGUAGE SO THAT IT CAN FURTHER EXPLORE SPECIFIC COMPONENTS. OF THE CLOSURE PLAN SUCH AS IMPACT ON STAFF- WHAT ASSISTANCE IT WOULD PROVIDE STAFF THROUGH THE ON RAMP DOWN PROCESS BUT THEY ALSO POTENTIAL OPTIONS FOR ALTERNATIVE USED IN THE FACILITY- AND THAT THIS PLAN AS NOTED IN YOUR STAFF RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE SUBMITTED TO THE LEGISLATURE AS A PART OF THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BY JET. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY. GREEN MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. YES SENATOR NIELSEN ADAMS YOU'RE HAVING REPRESENTED THE ONLY VETERAN PHONE FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND THEN FIFTEEN THE EXPANSION SETS I THINK I'M PRETTY AND THEY'RE STANDING CONVERSANT INFECTIONS. TO HOMES AND THE ISSUES ATTENDED THERE TOO. THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARILY SENSITIVE AREA. THE INDIVIDUAL WHO RESIDES IN THEIR- ARE VERY VERY SPECIAL INDIVIDUALS OBVIOUSLY THEIR MILITARY HISTORY. THE RESPECTABILITY DAMAGE THAT CAME TO THEM WE SORT OF ALL THEM THAT THAT HOME. THOUGH THAT HAS BEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL PROJECT OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AND YEAH BILL. AS WITH ADVANCED THAN IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S BEEN A BOON TO MANY OTHER AREAS AND I DID REPRESENT THE SHASTA COUNTY SO THE I. GOING ON ALL A HOME IT'S BEEN A PART OF THE YEAR THAT I REPRESENTED. AND THE DYNAMIC IS NOT JUST THE INDIVIDUALS HOUSE THERE IN BUT IT'S OF FAMILIAL ASPECT OF IT AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS A CONSIDERATION WITH ALL SUCH HEALTH FACILITIES BUT INDEED THAT IS THE CASE WITH THE VETERANS HOME. SO I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE- THIS WILL NOT A BE JUST PUT ON HOLD AND LET TO. LET'S LOOK AT IT OVER A PERIOD OF TIME AND CRAFT A PLAN. OF THE SHORT OF CLOSING THAT WOULD BE SURPRISING AS FAR AS BALANCING OUR BUDGET THIS IS NOT EVEN BUDGET DUST. SO I JUST DON'T THINK WE SHOULD TAKE IT SERIOUSLY AS TERMS OF A- FASHIONING AND OF BEING A AN INTEGRAL PART OF THIS PARTICULAR BUDGET SO YEAH BUT WE WERE LEAVING IT OPEN AND WILL. WILL CONSIDER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BETTER DRUGS OF ANY COMMENTS ON THING MAN I AM YOU KNOW I REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMENT THAT THERE'S NO SAVINGS TO BE MADE WHEN YOU'RE DOING-THIS KIND OF TRANSITION BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP THE SERVICES GOING WHETHER THERE'S FIFTY OR A HUNDRED PEOPLE THERE AND SO- I JUST I WANNA MAKE SURE THIS IS DONE IN THE MOST- DELICATE. AND SENSITIVE WAY BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE TRANSFORMING IN CHANGING PEOPLE'S LIVES AND MOVING THEM SOMEWHERE ELSE AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING IT IN A WAY THAT- INVOLVES OF FAMILY AND SO I THINK THAT THE IDEA OF HAVING A PLAN IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT SO THE MANAGER IF I MAY. I ALL I KNOW IS IT VETERANS HOMES PLACEMENT TO HAVE LONG WAITING LISTS. TO ASSUME THAT THESE COULD ALL BE JUST FANNED OUT. I THINK IS AN UNREASONABLE EXPECTATION. BUT I THINK THE- THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO REJECT THE MAY REVISION PROPOSAL TO CLOSE THE BARSTOW HOME AN ADOPT A PLACEHOLDER BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE TO A CAR CALVET TO SUBMIT A CLOSURE PLAN TO THE LEGISLATURE IS A REAL- IS REALLY GOOD RECOMMENDATION AND TO WORK WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS- FIT FOR THE UPCOMING BUDGET- EACH YEAR- SO I APPRECIATE THE- TESTIMONY AND THE- STAFF PROPOSAL TO- TO TAKE SOME TIME- RECOMMENDATION AND- WE LOOK FORWARD. TO SEEING A PLAN THAT- WE CAN LOOK AT AND COMFORTABLE AT SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY AND THANK YOU FOR PARTICIPATING IN IN NOT.

A FORM AND CHRISTY AND MORE HEARINGS AND INVESTIGATIONS RELATED THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF EIGHTY FIVE. QUESTION. ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE AT THIS POINT BUT WOULD GO INTO ANY COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS AYE I THINK I'D REALLY LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CHAIR GETS BACK HERE BEFORE WE DO IN THE FINAL ON THIS I GUESS WE'RE NOT VOTING ON IT THOUGH TODAY ANYWAY BUT IT IS A MATTER OF THE DISCUSSION SO WE HAD FINANCED WITH TRAVELER JAMERSON. OBSERVE THEIR YOUR- THANK YOU CHAD ALLEN OKAY WITH ALLEGE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'M- FOR CONTEXT MAYBE. A BIT HELPFUL SENATOR NIELSEN WITH RESPECT TO THESE THESE CHIU PROPOSALS ET DE UM THIS THE PROPOSAL IS INTENDED TO ALLOW STAFF TO RETRAIN TO APPLY THE NEW TESTS UNDER AB FIVE WHEN DETERMINING EMPLOYEES STATUS WHEN THEY'RE REVIEWING. BUSINESS PAYROLL TAX RECORDS ON. THAT THE STAFF ARE AS SOON AS PART OF THIS PROPOSAL TO BE NEEDED BECAUSE- WAITING TO BE ADMINISTRATION THEY ANTICIPATE THAT BUSINESSES WILL APPEAL. SOME OF THE NEW DECISIONS IF THE EMPLOYMENT STATUS OF THEIR WORKERS CHANGES AS A RESULT OF APPLYING TO TEST AND THOSE APPEALS RESULT IN IN SOME ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD AT UT SO THAT'S THE EDT COMPONENT I. T. I. OR IT'S A IT'S A LARGER PROPOSAL AND SPECIAL FUNDED ADS AS MY COLLEAGUES IN THE DEPARTMENT OF. FINANCE NOTED THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE POSITIONS AT THE I. R. OF WOULD BE WITHIN THE DIVISION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION AND THEY WERE SPECIFICALLY BE HEARING OFFICERS ARE TO A JUNIOR KATE WORKERS COMPENSATION. CLAIMS FALLING THROUGH THE PROCESS THERE WOULD ALSO BE SOME OF HIS POSITIONS WITHIN THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE FOR I WISH CRIME INVESTIGATIONS AND A FEW POSITIONS ACT CAL OSHA THAT THE BASIS UNDERLYING THE DIR PROPOSAL ON A WORKLOAD BASIS IS SIMPLY BAD AB FIVE WILL WILL RESULT IN A CERTAIN NUMBER OF FORMERLY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. WORKERS BEING RE CLASSIFIED IN HIGHER ESTEEM POLICE EMBOSSED THEIR THEIR DEPARTMENTAL WIDE WORKLOAD INCREASE I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS WE'RE GOING TO MORE SPECIFIC. ON EITHER THE PROPOSAL SENATOR. RETURN TO THE CHIRLA. THREE GET ON. BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. YES CENTER NIELSEN I JUST WILL OBSERVE WE NEED TO TAKE A VERY CLOSE LOOK AT THIS. THIS PARTICULAR LEGISLATION AND WHAT IT WILL TAKE TO IMPLEMENT THAT LEGISLATION THE CONCERN TO ME IS THAT TO CERTAIN PEOPLE ADMIN AND CERTAIN POSITIONS ARE NOT GOING TO BE A VERY DIFFERENT POSITIONS AND IT'S- GOING TO BE A- NOT MAY BE. CONFUSING BUT PERILOUS SO WE HAVE TO GO WITH CAUTION THAT'S MY RULE. THIRD DRAWS OF. IT SENATE BILL SO I THINK THAT'S A REALLY GOOD POINT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE. UP A HARD TRANSITION TO GO TO- FOR EMPLOYERS FOR OWNERS OF BUSINESSES FOR OFF FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN WOMEN THEMSELVES SO I'M I'M GLAD TO SEE. THAT WE'RE GONNA BE READY FOR IT- VERSUS JUST GET GETTING INUNDATED AND- ALREADY A LOT OF QUESTIONS SO I THINK. THIS FEELS LIKE WE'RE IN THE BUDGET BETTER POSITION MORE PREPARED TO HANDLE THE ISSUES. WELL THE CONCERN I HAVE WITH THIS PARTICULAR ITEM IS JUST THAT THE- LANDSCAPE IS CHANGING- THERE WAS A BILL HEARD I BELIEVE YESTERDAY THAT- READ SOME MORE EXEMPTIONS. AND WHETHER THAT GETS THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE NODDED IT'S A IT THERE IS SOME UNCERTAINTY AND THERE'S I THINK IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE WHILE FOR US TO GET THROUGH THIS AND SO- I AM I APPRECIATE THE I APPRECIATE YOU KNOW THE DIRECTION WE'RE GOING IN. I SUPPORTED- BUT I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION BEFORE WE ON. BEFORE WE START ACTING TO BEEF UP A DEPARTMENT- WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT WE'RE BEEFING IT FOR AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IT SO- THIS IS A BY A HOLDOVER ITEM AND I DO APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION SO THAT WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING. IN AS WE AS WE MOVE ON THIS IT'S CREATED A GREAT DEAL OF UNCERTAINTY AND FEAR IN THE COMMUNITY AND I WANT TO BE ABLE TO SAY WE KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO WITH IT SO HOLD OPEN I THINK MAKES A LOT OF SENSE- THAT- CONCLUDES ITEMS NUMBER FIVE. IT ISSUE NUMBER FIVE IN ISSUE NUMBER FIFTEEN WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE. NUMBER TWENTY ONE IN ISSUE NUMBER THIRTY ONE WILL TAKE THOSE TOGETHER. THAT SAID THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AGAIN. VICTIMS OF WAGE THEFT AND THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FUND LOAN TO THE GENERAL FUND. SO IT WILL. DO WE WANT TO START WITH THAT DEPARTMENT OR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. HELLO GO HEAD AND- MARK MEADOWS APARTMENT OF FINANCE- BUT MAY REVISION WITHDRAWS- THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE PROPOSED AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WHICH WOULD HAVE ALLOWED THE USE OF OLE GARMENT REGISTRATION YOU REFUSE TO. WAGES IN THE CAR INDUSTRY AND WOULD HAVE EXPANDED ALLOWABLE. USE H. FIND. THEY ARE TYPES OF WAYS CLAIM HOWEVER WE ARE WE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE TO ALLOW THE TRANSFER OF FUNDS- YEAH IN THE WAGE FIND THE I. R. STUDY RESTITUTION FINES INCLUDING THE GARMENT ACCOUNT- PRIOR TO THE END OF YOUR GENERAL FUND SWEET. QUESTIONS VERY GOOD. HELLO. THANK YOU TRAVIS ALLEN- AGAIN WITH THE ANALYST'S OFFICE THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD I'M JUST BRIEFLY IS THAT LAST YEAR THIS SUB COMMITTEE APPROVED AS PART OF THAT THE BUDGET ACTED COMPANY EXAMPLE MENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE DIRECTED THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS TO PROVIDE A RECORDS THE LEGISLATURE WITH DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT THE GARMENT FUND SPECIFICALLY AND ITS CHALLENGES RECENTLY WITH SOLVENCY ARE WE'RE STILL ANTICIPATING THAT REPORT WAS DUE EARLIER THIS YEAR- WITH CURRENT CONDITIONS. UNDERSTANDABLY OPPOSITE WAYS IT'S TO BE EXPECTED BUT I THINK THE SUBCOMMITTEE AS WELL AS OUR OFFICE WOULD APPRECIATE REVIEWING THAT REPORT AND WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE ADMINISTRATION GOING FORWARD- WHEN REVIEWING THAT. THE FUTURE. OF THE RESTITUTION FINES OF THEIR STRUCTURE. BRING THE MATTER TO THE COMMITTEE. YOUR HONOR DRAWS SO THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I REMEMBER THIS VERY. VERY WELL WHEN THEY CAME BEFORE US LAST YEAR- ON THE ISSUE OF THE WAGE THEFT IN THE WAGE CLAIMS BY THESE- GARMENT WORKERS. AND SO I I'M I'M- ARMED. DISAPPOINTED THAT. OF LAST YEAR'S CASES OF ONLY NINETEEN OF FORTY SIX CASES PENDING- IN THE RESTITUTION FUND HAVE BEEN PAID THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING SO. THIS IS ALL ALL THE WORLD CASES WERE ALL THE REQUIRED PAPERWORK IS SIGNED SO WHAT IS THE ISSUE HERE HOLDING BACK PAYMENT OF THESE VICTIMS OF WAGE THEFT ARE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND AND AS IT IS THEY WERE ALREADY. IT'S NOT JUST THIS YEAR THAT'S DELAYED THEM GETTING THEIR FOR THEIR- WAGES IT'S A YEAR OR TWO YEARS OR WHATEVER IT TOOK TO GET TO THE POINT OF GETTING THEIR CLAIMS PROCESS SO. CAN SOMEBODY EXPLAIN THAT TO ME. YES MORE COMMUNITIES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I CAN RESPOND TO THAT- THIS IS A REMINDER ON LAST YEAR WE TRANSFERRED TO NINE MILLION DOLLARS FROM BEHIND WHICH FUNDS THROUGH THE GARMENT ACCOUNT. TO PAY YOUR WAGE CLAIMS IN ADDITION. WE NEED THIS YEAR AS PART OF TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET TRANSFERRED ANOTHER SEVEN POINT THREE MILLION- FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO PAY GARMENT CLAIMS. AND SO WE HAVE FRIENDS OVER OVER SIXTEEN MILLION TO PAY- GOVERNMENT CLAIMS AND- BUT IT THE OTHER LINE YES YOU IS THAT THERE IS A HIGH DEMAND BUT- ENOUGH OUR RESOURCES YOU ADEQUATE HEY ALTHOUGH I AM CAIT ALL OF THE ON. WHICH FUNDS. ALTHOUGH I'M HERE ALL THE WAY CLAIMS THAT ARE COMING IN AND- ZERO IT. RESPONDS THROUGHOUT. POINT ABOUT A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT LANGUAGE WE JUST WANTED TO SURE THAT WE'RE WE'RE SO IT'S UNDER WHAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE YOUR REFLECT THIS OUR CURRENTLY WAITING WE WERE WAITING AT THE TIME TO ADDRESS THE NUMBER OF OUTSTANDING CLAIMS I'M CURRENTLY THERE'S TWO HUNDRED. AND TWENTY SIX CLAIMS OR FORGETTING WE'RE ACTUALLY GETTING READY TO TRANSFER ON ANOTHER EIGHT POINT NINE MILLION HEY THAT OUTSTANDING CLAIMS THIS YEAR SO THAT SHOULD ADDRESS ANY OUTSTANDING. CLAIMS RAINY THIS YEAR. WELL I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU FOR THE FOR THE EXPLANATION. YOU KNOW FOR US- A CLAIM OF YOU KNOW FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS OR A THOUSAND DOLLARS. YOU KNOW. IS REALLY NOT A WHOLE LOT- BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW THESE WORKERS WHO. LIVE WORK WORSE THAN ON THE EDGE THE ALREADY LIVE IN DEEP POVERTY AND FOR THEM NOT TO GET THEIR THEIR WAGES PAID I THINK IS REALLY OUTRAGEOUS- AND I THINK IT JUST POINTS TO. THE PROBLEMS IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY AND HERE WE ARE YOU KNOW. DEALING WITH AND THOSE WORKERS DEALING WITH THE FACT THAT THEY DON'T GET PAID IN AN INDUSTRY THAT HAS THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF WAGE THEFT- THERE'S SOMETHING LIGHT THE- TWENTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS A WEEK. IN WAGE THEFT FOR LOW WAGE WORKERS TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS A WEEK IMAGINE WHAT WE AS A STATE WOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY YOU KNOW FOR THOSE FAMILIES AND ALL THE DIFFERENT SERVICES THAT THEY NEED AS A RESULT OF BEING POOR. TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS A WEEK WOULD GO INTO THOSE COMMUNITIES- SO I FEEL SO STRONGLY ABOUT THE LIABILITIES OF THESE EMPLOYERS AND IT MAKES EMPLOYERS TO DO GOOD. WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE. PUT ME GIVES THEM PUT THEM AT A BIG DISADVANTAGE BECAUSE THEY THEN ARE. PLAYING BY THE RULES THEIR PAIN AS THEY SHOULD THEIR TREATING THEIR WORKERS GOOD AND THEN YOU HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHERS ALL SCRUPULOUS ARE ARE REALLY THERE'S MORE TO IT THAN JUST THOSE THOSE CLAIMS. THERE'S A MUCH BIGGER DEEPER PROBLEM THAT I HOPE WE ADDRESS AS WELL THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU FOR TAKING THOSE ISSUES THAT- UNDOUBTEDLY IT TO THAT AFFECTS ALL OF US- BUT THOSE FAMILIES ARE THE ONES THAT ARE. ARE SUFFERING THE MOST AND THAT'S- WE'RE- ALL KINDS OF RAMPS TO TRY TO FILL IN AND BE IN BEHIND AND IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. AT THAT VERY MUCH. CENTER NIELSEN DID YOU HAVE ANY COMMENT ON THIS. ALL RIGHT ARM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THAT THAT COMMON IN WE PROBABLY SHOULD LOOK AT THAT A LITTLE BIT A LITTLE BIT FURTHER INTO WHAT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. BACK THAT CONCLUDES ITEM NUMBER TWENTY ONE AND THIRTY ONE- IS A THIRTY ONE- IT ALL I'M SORRY I'M SORRY WE DIDN'T WE DIDN'T GET TO THIRTY ONE. I'M SORRY YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WE'LL MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER THIRTY ONE WHICH IS THE- LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FUND LOAN TO THE GENERAL FUND. AND WILL TURN IT OVER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I MARK HARMON BY ANTS ON THE NEIGHBOR VISION INCLUDES A SPECIAL ON LOAN. SEVEN MILLION TO THE GENERAL FUND RESPONSE YOU. I BUDGET SHORTFALL ON THE LOAN IS COMING FROM THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ONE OF THE PURPOSE OF WHICH IS TO FIND PROVIDE A LOT OF RESEARCH USED. OR SPENT ON REVENUE SOURCES CIVIL PENALTIES RELATED TO PARK OR OTHER PRIVATE. GENERAL LACK I WOULD MAKING THIS DECISION SECOND TO CONSIDERATION OF PROGRAMS HE- ACTUALLY RESPONDS ON ALONE CAN BE MADE WITHOUT CAUSING HARM TO THE PROGRAM. AND WE WILL BE PAYING BACK ALONG WITH THE PROGRAM NEEDS IT OR NO LONGER NEEDED BY THE GENERAL FUND UNLESS OF COURSE THE PROGRAM I NEED FASTER. HELLO. WE HAVE NO COMMENT ON ON THIS PORTION OR PROPOSAL INTIMIDATION THANK YOU. VERY GOOD THING ABOUT COULD COMMITTEE CENTER DRESS OF THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- WELL I WOULD. I WOULD BEG TO DIFFER I THINK RIGHT NOW. THIS DEPARTMENT NEEDS THE MONEY I THINK RIGHT NOW WE JUST. THE CAME OFF OF A CONVERSATION OF VICTIMS OF WAGE THEFT IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY AND IN GENERAL LOW WAGE WORKERS. LOSING TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS A WEEK I DON'T SEE HOW WE COULD AT A TIME LIKE THIS WHEN LOW WAGE WORKERS WERE SUPER EXPLOITED UP WHEN THEY NEED THIS KIND OF UP OF ASSISTANCE. THAT WE WOULD BE TAKING THAT MONEY FOR SOMETHING ELSE I DON'T SEE THE RATIONALE THERE'S NO REPAYMENT PLAN PRESENTED THERE'S NO INTEREST BEING CHARGED I DON'T THINK NOW'S THE TIME TO BE TAKING OF FUNDING FROM VULNERABLE WORKERS- I WAS REMINDED THAT SOME THE LAST TIME IT THE GENERAL FUND QUOTE UNQUOTE BORROWED FUNDS. FROM THE STI DURING THE RECESSION IT TOOK TEN YEARS TO REPAY- AND THAT'S JUST NOT ACCEPTABLE AT A TIME WHEN- YOU KNOW HARD WORKING HARD WORKING MEN AND WOMEN. GET THEIR WAGES ARE STOLEN OR OTHER ISSUES- THAT THEY HAVE TO LITIGATE SO I REALLY OF WHAT ASKED SERIOUSLY TO RECONSIDER THIS LOAN ALLOW THAT DEPARTMENT TO KEEP ON WITH THEIR- THEIR FUNDING- AND THAT'S WHERE I STAND MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT DONNA THAT COMMENT AND- IT'S PART OF THE CHALLENGE WITH WITH LOANS FROM OUT OF A FUND IS IT THEN THE FUND IS NOT NOT AVAILABLE- BUT WHAT WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT- SOMEONE'S MADE AN ANALYSIS OF IT THE FUND HAS ENOUGH MONEY TO MEET THE NEEDS FORWARD THAT YEAR THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING BUT I GET YOUR POINT AND- APPRECIATE YOU RAISING THAT ISSUE VERY. VERY MUCH AND THAT CONCLUDES ADAM- ISSUE NUMBER THIRTY ONE- WE HAD THAT THREE OF THE THREE OF THE ITEMS THAT- THAT THE RECOMMENDATION IS CHANGE ONE OF THEM IS ISSUE NUMBER ONE AND I FRANKLY WANTED THAT ONE PULLED SO THAT I COULD JUST MAKE A COMMENT- IN REGARDS TO A BEING OPEN AND THAT'S ISSUE NUMBER ONE WHICH IS THE- PAID FAMILY LEAVE TRAILER BILL- IF WE COULD TAKE THAT WENT UP RIGHT NOW I. JUST HAVE A VERY BRIEF COMMENT. IT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE IN MY MIND OF DOING POLICY WORK IN A- IN A BUDGET. BUDGET DOWN TRAILER BILL BUT- IS THERE SOMEONE WHO COULD SPEAK SPEAK ON THIS ONE FROM THE- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. HI YES I'M WORKING ON IS AGAIN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON A NEW LOOK SAD AND LONELY THERE NOW. THERE I HAVE MY PRINCIPLE ON THE SIDE. SO BUT NEIGHBORHOODS INQUIRIES ALMOST ONE NOT ONE MILLION DOLLARS EACH YEAR ON SMALL BUSINESSES. STATION YEAH EXPANSION. I CAN COME A COMPONENT OF THE- THE CALIFORNIA BOUNTY RIGHT ACT IN ADDITION TO WHAT WE'RE DOING UP OUR EXTENSIONS TO THE FAMILY EACH PROGRAM. ON THIS WE ALSO INCLUDE A PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO PROVIDE FULL TWELVE WEEKS OF JOB PROTECTED YOU TO ALL WORKERS FOR CARRYING BABY BONDING FOR AND FOR PREGNANCY REGARDLESS REGARDLESS EMPLOYER SIDE SO THAT'S THE REAL YEAH EXPANSION ON AND- THIS EXPANSIVE CALIFORNIA FAMILY RIGHTS ACT TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FAMILIAL RELATIONSHIPS CURRENTLY COVERED. BY THE PAID FAMILY. LEAVE ANY SOLUTIONS. SO GRANT FRENCH. NOTHING PARTNERS AND PARENTS OUT IN LOS IN ALLOWS PARENTS WHO WORK WITH THE SAME EMPLOYER TO RECEIVE ALL WEEKS OF PROTECTED BE REMOVED LANGUAGE STOP WHAT HAVE ALLOWED ME TO DENY THE A LOT SALLY EMPLOYEE I MEAN IT'S A QUESTION THANK VERY MUCH HELLO. HELLO THIS. COMMON ON ON THIS PROPOSED CHANGE TO THE CHOPPER TECH TO LEAVE TO ALIGN IT WITH WITH PAID FAMILY LEAVE- I'M SORRY YOUR POINT ABOUT THIS POTENTIALLY BEING A QUESTION FOR THE POLICY COMMITTEE PROCESS IS A VALID ONE. THERE ARE LARGE POLICY QUESTIONS AND- IT COULD BE BEST HEARD IN THAT VENUE- THOUGH I WOULD ADD THAT THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE EXPANSION UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET LAST YEAR FROM SIX WEEKS TO EIGHT WEEKS WAS TAKEN AS PART OF THE BUDGET PROCESS OF THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THAT STEP THAT WAS TAKEN LAST YEAR. SHE THAT THAT VERY MUCH ANY COMMITTEE MEMBER WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT. I JUST HAVE TO SAY THAT I SUPPORT FAMILY LIVE I THINK IT'S- A TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT. OF. AT BENEFIT TO HAVE AND- IN THE IN THE EXPANSION TO INCLUDE OTHER OTHER THAN THE PARENTS AS WELL IT IT. BEING GRANDPARENTS EXEDRA AND I THINK THAT'S ALL REALLY GOOD WHAT WHAT IT FOCUS ON QUITE FRANKLY IS. THAT THIS IT COULD EXPANSION INCLUDES EMPLOYERS OF ANY SIZE AND- I'M WORRIED ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THE EMPLOYER HAS NO DISCRETION TO DENY OR TO ASK THE EMPLOYEE TO MODIFY THE LEAVE TO ACCOMMODATE THE EMPLOYER'S BUSINESS OPERATIONS- AND IT COMES ON TOP OF THE TWO WEEKS PROVIDED BY THE CARES ACT AND THE EXISTING TWELVE WEEKS OF FMLA. AND SO AN EMPLOYEE MOM. CAN GET CAN BE OUT FOR HALF A YEAR AND FOR A SMALL BUSINESS I RAN A SMALL LAW PRACTICE. FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS WE ONLY HAD TWO OR THREE PEOPLE ON AND WHENEVER SOMEONE WAS OUT WE HAD TO OBSERVE THE WORK DAY WITH THE WORKLOAD AND AT THE END OF THE DAY- EMPLOYERS REALLY WANT TO RETAIN THEIR EMPLOYEES. AND DO EVERYTHING TO ACCOMMODATE THEM BUT YOU GOT TO KEEP THE POSITION OPEN AND- SO- YOU GOT TO KEEP THE POSITION OPEN AND IT'S GOT TO BE THE SAME POSITION THAT YOU OFFER AND SO IF THE BUSINESS CHANGES LIKE. UNDER THE CARE ACT- AB YOU COULD BE IN VIOLATION OF THE LAW SO I JUST WORRY I WORRY ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING TO SMALL BUSINESSES AND PARTICULARLY AT THIS. AT THIS PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME AND- SO I YOU KNOW I WANT TO BE SUPPORTIVE BUT THIS IS REALLY A TOUGH A TOUGH NEW ADDITION TO WHAT. WE'RE ASKING SMALL BUSINESSES TO DO WHEN WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA LOSE A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF OUR BUSINESSES SO. I JUST WANT TO. GO ON THE RECORD SAYING THAT I'M I'M REALLY WORRIED ABOUT IT AND I KNOW I'VE HEARD FROM MY BUSINESS MY SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY AS WELL. THAT THEY'RE CONCERNED AS WELL. SO THAT CONCLUDES THAT ITEM. AND THAT CONCLUDES ALL THE ITEMS THAT WERE WERE GOING TO HEAR FOR TODAY- OUR NEXT TASK YES JUST A QUESTION. IS NOT ON THE AGENDA BUT I WAS GOING TO RAISE IT UNDER THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. IN THE EITC. A ISSUE I YES DO YOU HAVE AN ITEM AND ITEM NUMBER. WELL IT WAS UNDER- SEVEN SEVEN THREE OF THE UNDER THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. WHEN WE TOOK IT UP A LITTLE WHILE AGO. I THINK YOU MENTIONED WE WOULD DO IT AT THE END OF. FOR THE. WITHIN A SPECIFIC ITEM BUT IT'S UNDER THAT DEPARTMENT THAT I WANTED TO RAISE AN ISSUE WITH THE COMMUNISTS HEY YES SO IT'S FOR THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD AND- I JUST. I JUST WANT TO SAY THE BUDGET YOU KNOW DOES A GOOD THING AS A AND TWENTY NINETEEN DO GOOD THING OF EXPANDING THE- YEAH I. T. C. FOR- FAMILIES AND REACHING- A MILLION MORE. HOUSEHOLDS AND RAISING THEN YOU KNOW THE NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLDS RECEIVING THE CREDIT SO OUR OUR TO VERY GOOD THING THOUSAND DOLLARS CREDIT ALL MY PROBLEM AND I WANTED TO RAISE IT HERE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF THE BUDGET. IS EXPANDING THE EITC TIGHTENED TAX FILERS. DATE ARM THOSE WORKING MEN AND WOMEN ARE CONTRIBUTING THEIR FILING THEIR TAXES THERE- PERFORMING ALL ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT WORK- AND WE ARE. REALLY IGNORING THAT AS A PART OF THIS ECONOMY WHEN IT COMES TO HAVING THE SAME ACCESS TO THE SAME PROGRAMS AS EVERYBODY ELSE- THIS IS A AN ISSUE THAT WAS BROUGHT UP AS A MULTI CAUCUS PRIORITY THE LATINO ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER. LGBT Q. BLACK CAUCUS AND JEWISH CAUCUS ALL- PUT THIS AS A PRIORITY ISSUE WHICH IS A HARD THING TO DO- AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO EXTEND OUR ACCESS TO ALL INCOME ELIGIBLE TAXPAYING WORKERS IN THE STATE. SIXTY THOUSAND INCOME ELIGIBLE I TEN HOLDERS AND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN WOULD BENEFIT FROM THIS CHANGE IN POLICY- THERE'S BEEN NO RATIONAL BASIS TO CONTINUE TO EXCLUDE TAX PAYING RESIDENTS FROM THIS PROGRAM WHO CAN PROVIDE AND I TEN NUMBER SHOWING THAT THEY PAY TAXES. AND IN LIEU OF A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER SO I WANT TO RAISE IT TO OF THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD THEY'RE NOT THE ONES WHO MAKE THE DECISION BUT THIS IS. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT TIME ESPECIALLY WELL WHEN OF THOSE MEN AND WOMEN ARE PROBABLY NOT ELIGIBLE FOR OTHER PROGRAMS AND I SAFETY NET SO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR INDULGING ME ABSOLUTELY WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR YOUR COMMENTS HERE TODAY.
