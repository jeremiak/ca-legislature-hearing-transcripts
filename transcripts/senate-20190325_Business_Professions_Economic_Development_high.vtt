IT'S NECESSARY THAT IT TAKES

00:06:19.712 --> 00:06:20.780
THREE DAYS BECAUSE OUR CURRENT

00:29:09.948 --> 00:29:10.548
ACCORDING TO THE JOURNAL OF THE

FOUND YEARS AFTER THEY WERE LOST

00:29:30.335 --> 00:29:31.769
TO MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY.

00:29:31.836 --> 00:29:33.371
AND THERE IS A VARIETY OF

00:29:33.438 --> 00:29:34.772
EXAMPLES ARE DURING THE COW FIRE

00:29:34.839 --> 00:29:36.141
THE FIRE SPREAD SO FAST THAT

00:29:36.207 --> 00:29:37.308
PEOPLE BARELY HAD TIME TO SAVE

THEMSELVES LITTLE LET ALONE

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:40.078

00:29:40.145 --> 00:29:41.946
OVER THE FOLLOWING WEEKS FIRST

00:29:42.013 --> 00:29:43.515
RESPONDERS CARRIED THOUSANDS OF

00:29:43.581 --> 00:29:44.749

HOSPITALS EMERGENCY ANIMAL

00:29:47.819 --> 00:29:49.454

00:29:49.521 --> 00:29:50.622
THEN TO REUNITE.

00:29:50.688 --> 00:29:51.856
THESE ANIMALS WITH THEIR OWNERS

00:29:51.923 --> 00:29:53.057
AND IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE

00:29:53.124 --> 00:29:55.460
LUCKY ANIMALS.

00:29:55.527 --> 00:29:57.929
WHO HAD MICROCHIPS -- OF HAD

00:29:57.996 --> 00:30:00.098
BEEN REUNITED BUT IT WOULD HAVE

00:30:00.165 --> 00:30:01.366
BEEN DIFFICULT BECAUSE WHISKERS

00:30:01.432 --> 00:30:03.468
WERE SINGED OFF YEARS PAINFULLY

00:30:03.535 --> 00:30:05.236

SHAVE FOR TREATMENT.

00:30:06.571 --> 00:30:08.873
SO BASICALLY SOME OF THEM WERE

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:10.108
UNRECOGNIZABLE.

00:30:10.175 --> 00:30:11.843
WITH THIS BILL WE HAVE AN

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:13.244
OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO

THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND

00:30:21.186 --> 00:30:22.187
CURRENTLY HAS A VERY SIMILAR

00:30:22.253 --> 00:30:23.121
BILL GOING THROUGH THEIR

00:30:35.099 --> 00:30:35.667

SEVEN WITH ONE OF THE COMPONENTS

00:31:10.268 --> 00:31:12.637
OF OUR MISSION BEING TO REDUCE.

EUTHANASIA IN OUR SHELTERS.

00:31:14.205 --> 00:31:16.674
AS IT IS ETHICALLY MORALLY AND

00:31:16.741 --> 00:31:17.709
FINANCIALLY THE RIGHT THING TO

00:31:17.775 --> 00:31:19.611
DO ALTHOUGH WE HAVE MADE STRIDES

00:31:19.677 --> 00:31:21.212
WITH HER EFFORTS OVER THE YEARS

00:31:21.279 --> 00:31:22.814
ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS THAT MUST

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.115
BE IMPLEMENTED STATEWIDE IS

00:31:24.182 --> 00:31:25.383
MICROCHIP BEING.

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:27.418
HAVING A PATCHWORK OR LACK OF

00:31:27.485 --> 00:31:29.954

00:31:30.021 --> 00:31:31.723
AS ANIMALS ONCE ON LOOSE HAVENO

00:31:31.789 --> 00:31:33.524

00:31:33.591 --> 00:31:35.326
PICKED UP IN ONE COMMUNITY AND

00:31:35.393 --> 00:31:37.228
DROPPED OFF IN ANOTHER SHELTER.

00:31:37.295 --> 00:31:38.429
ONE OF THE PRIMARY ISSUES WITH

00:31:38.496 --> 00:31:39.998
ANIMALS COMING INTO SHELTERS AS

00:31:40.064 --> 00:31:41.633
LACK OF IDENTIFICATION CALLERS

00:31:41.699 --> 00:31:43.768
FALLOFF FOR THE ANIMAL DID NOT

00:31:43.835 --> 00:31:44.936
HAVE ONE TO BEGIN WITH.

00:31:45.003 --> 00:31:46.271
THIS IS WHY AMERICA CHIP IS THE

00:31:46.337 --> 00:31:48.573
ONLY REAL SOLUTION FOR ANIMALS

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.008

00:51:08.265 --> 00:51:10.000
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T OKAY IT IS --

00:51:10.066 --> 00:51:11.902
ALL RIGHT GUYS THAT'S QUITE

00:51:11.968 --> 00:51:15.405
ALRIGHT SO -- FIRST OF ALL --

00:51:15.472 --> 00:51:16.440
THE FIRST ONE WOULD THINK WOULD

00:51:16.506 --> 00:51:17.741
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE --

00:51:17.808 --> 00:51:19.376
AND AND AND AND CERTAINLY WE

00:51:19.443 --> 00:51:22.746
WANT -- TO AS A STATE AND AS

00:51:22.813 --> 00:51:24.581
SUPPORT ALL VETERANS -- I I

00:51:24.648 --> 00:51:25.715
THINK YOU WHAT YOU'RE HEARING IN

00:51:25.782 --> 00:51:27.317
THE DISCUSSION IS A BIT OF THE

00:51:27.384 --> 00:51:28.852
TENSION HERE RIGHT SO.

00:51:28.919 --> 00:51:30.787
ON ONE HAND YOU KNOW YOU --

00:51:30.854 --> 00:51:32.189
YOU'VE LIMITED THE BILL TO THE

00:51:32.255 --> 00:51:33.557
PEOPLE HAVE THE DRIVER'S LICENSE

00:51:33.623 --> 00:51:35.592
BUT THAT ALSO LIMITING BECAUSE

00:51:35.659 --> 00:51:36.760
THE CHALLENGES OF GETTING IT

00:51:36.827 --> 00:51:38.528
DRIVER'S LICENSE IN FACT MANY OF

00:51:38.595 --> 00:51:39.229
THE VETERANS YOU MAY WANT TO

00:51:39.296 --> 00:51:39.830
HELP.

00:51:39.896 --> 00:51:41.531
WE HAVE SOME CHALLENGES GETTING

00:51:41.598 --> 00:51:42.599
DISPOSING DRIVER'S LICENSE THERE

00:51:42.666 --> 00:51:43.967
MAY BE CERTAIN REASONS OR

00:51:44.034 --> 00:51:45.101
WHATEVER.

00:51:45.168 --> 00:51:46.703
AT THE FLIP SIDE I THINK WE HAVE

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:48.205
SOME TENSION ABOUT.

00:51:48.271 --> 00:51:51.308
THE COST IT HAS TO THE SHELTERS --

00:51:51.374 --> 00:51:53.677
AND AND I THINK TO BE ENTIRELY

00:51:53.743 --> 00:51:54.711
FAIR I DON'T KNOW HOW THE STATE

00:51:54.778 --> 00:51:56.446
MANDATE COMMISSION WOULD VIEW

00:51:56.513 --> 00:51:58.148
THIS AS THIS BECAME LAW.

00:51:58.215 --> 00:51:59.449
SINCE THESE ARE PUBLIC SHELTERS

00:51:59.516 --> 00:52:01.485
BUT IN MANY WAYS WHAT HAPPENS IS

00:52:01.551 --> 00:52:03.753
THAT WORSE ARE REQUIRING SOMEONE

00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:06.590
ELSE TO PROVIDE NO IT'S VERY.

00:52:06.656 --> 00:52:07.824
IMPORTANT USEFUL SERVICE FOR

00:52:07.891 --> 00:52:09.359
FREE ESSENTIALLY.

00:52:09.426 --> 00:52:11.661
AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW I I

00:52:11.728 --> 00:52:12.829
THINK THERE'S SOME CHALLENGES

00:52:12.896 --> 00:52:14.998
THERE IN THE SENSE THAT -- AS

00:52:15.065 --> 00:52:16.800
MUCH YOU KNOW AND I AGREE WITH

00:52:16.867 --> 00:52:17.968
ALL THE TESTIMONY ABOUT THE

00:52:18.034 --> 00:52:19.870
BENEFITS AND AND CERTAINLY OUR

00:52:19.936 --> 00:52:21.571
VETERANS HAVE -- HAVE PUT THEIR

00:52:21.638 --> 00:52:23.306
LIVES ON THE LINE TO TO TO

00:52:23.373 --> 00:52:25.041
PROTECT US SO WE NEED TO FIGURE

00:52:25.108 --> 00:52:26.877
OUT WAYS TO HELP THEM -- BUT IN

00:52:26.943 --> 00:52:28.345
SOME SENSES IF WE AS A STATE ARE

00:52:28.411 --> 00:52:29.813
GONNA SAY WELL WE'RE GOING TO

00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:31.815
WAIVE THE ADOPTION FEES ETCETERA

00:52:31.882 --> 00:52:32.816
THEN WE SHOULD BE BACK FILLING

00:52:32.883 --> 00:52:34.217
IT SOMEWHERE BECAUSE THE

00:52:34.284 --> 00:52:36.152
SHELTERS -- MANY OF THEM --

00:52:36.219 --> 00:52:37.220
THEY'RE RUNNING ON FAIRLY SHOE

00:52:37.287 --> 00:52:39.055
STRING BUDGETS THEY NEED THOSE

00:52:39.122 --> 00:52:40.023
THOSE FUNDS TO HELP YOU KNOW

00:52:40.090 --> 00:52:41.091
TAKE CARE OF THE ANIMALS THAT

00:52:41.157 --> 00:52:43.159
THEY DO HAVE THEIR UNTIL THEY

00:52:43.226 --> 00:52:44.294
CAN GET THEM ADOPTED AND SO

00:52:44.361 --> 00:52:46.496
FORTH -- SO I I THINK THERE'S A

00:52:46.563 --> 00:52:48.064
STILL A LOT OF OUTSTANDING

00:52:48.131 --> 00:52:51.468
ISSUES TO WORK OUT -- THAT WE I

00:52:51.535 --> 00:52:59.009
THINK WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT.

00:52:59.075 --> 00:52:59.676
HOW WE'RE GONNA BE SURE THIS IS

00:52:59.743 --> 00:53:01.311
ADEQUATELY FUNDED IN A WAY -- TO

00:53:01.378 --> 00:53:02.245
BE SURE THAT OUR STATE OR

00:53:02.312 --> 00:53:03.980
SHELTERS OR ARE ARE FINANCIALLY

00:53:04.047 --> 00:53:04.414
YOU KNOW.

00:53:04.481 --> 00:53:05.048
NOT GONNA BE OVER BURDENED TO

00:53:05.115 --> 00:53:05.649
THAT BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO

00:53:05.715 --> 00:53:06.516
SHELTERS CLOSING FOR THE ANIMALS

00:53:06.583 --> 00:53:07.784
WE WANT TO GET THE ANIMALS TO

00:53:07.851 --> 00:53:09.753
THE VETERANS WITH -- TOO WHO WHO

00:53:09.819 --> 00:53:11.655
WHO DESIRE THEM WITH THE MINIMUM

00:53:11.721 --> 00:53:18.028
AMOUNT OF I GUESS BURDEN RIGHT I
