PRESENTING TO THE COMMITTEE ON

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.851
THIS VERY VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC.

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:00.887
MY NAME IS ON THE HORIZON I'M AN

00:07:00.953 --> 00:07:02.221
ATTORNEY ADMITTED IN BOTH

00:07:02.288 --> 00:07:04.190
CALIFORNIA AND NEW YORK. I

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:06.259
CURRENTLY HAVE MY OWN SOLO LAW

00:07:06.325 --> 00:07:07.660

SPECIALISING IN FAMILY LAW AND

00:07:09.996 --> 00:07:11.931
DEPENDENCY IN THOSE STATES.

00:07:11.998 --> 00:07:12.965
HOWEVER I AM HERE TODAY

00:07:13.032 --> 00:07:14.901
TESTIFYING IN MY CAPACITY AS A

00:07:14.967 --> 00:07:16.068
MEMBER OF THE DEPENDENCY

00:07:16.135 --> 00:07:18.371
ADVISORY PANEL. OF THE FAMILY

00:07:18.437 --> 00:07:21.140
VIOLENCE HELLO PROJECT. AND I

00:07:21.207 --> 00:07:22.508
WANT TO ADDRESS THREE THINGS IN

00:07:22.575 --> 00:07:25.178
MY TESTIMONY TODAY. THE FIRST IS

00:07:25.244 --> 00:07:25.812
THAT I'VE BEEN ASKED BY

00:07:25.878 --> 00:07:27.413
COMMITTEE STAFF. TO GIVE A VERY

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:32.185
BRIEF OVERVIEW. OF WHAT I

00:07:32.251 --> 00:07:32.752
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. NO MORE

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:35.054
COMPLICATED. I'M THAT MANY

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:36.355
PEOPLE THINK THE SECOND IS ALL

00:07:36.422 --> 00:07:38.825
EXPLAIN WHAT MY ORGANIZATION

00:07:38.891 --> 00:07:40.259
DOES THE FAMILY VIOLENCE A PILOT

00:07:40.326 --> 00:07:42.795
PROJECT AND THIRD OF ALL ADDRESS

00:07:42.862 --> 00:07:45.998
SOME REAL ISSUES THAT WE SEE IN

00:07:46.065 --> 00:07:47.567
THE CURRENT DEPENDENCY SYSTEM IN

00:07:47.633 --> 00:07:51.137
CHILD WELFARE. SO TO BEGIN WITH-

00:07:51.204 --> 00:07:53.406
I DON'T THINK ANYONE AT THIS

00:07:53.472 --> 00:07:55.341
HEARING NEEDS TO BE TOLD THAT

00:07:55.408 --> 00:07:56.142
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS NOT A HUGE

00:07:56.209 --> 00:07:58.211
PROBLEM ONE IN FOUR WOMEN WILL

00:07:58.277 --> 00:07:59.345
EXPERIENCE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN

00:07:59.412 --> 00:08:02.315
THEIR LIFETIMES ONE IN SEVEN MEN

00:08:02.381 --> 00:08:03.216
AND ONE IN THREE WOMEN EVERY DAY

00:08:03.282 --> 00:08:04.851
IN THE UNITED STATES ARE

00:08:04.917 --> 00:08:05.384
MURDERED BY THEIR INTIMATE

00:08:05.451 --> 00:08:07.653
PARTNERS. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ALSO

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.388
HAS VERY SERIOUS SEVERE EFFECTS

00:08:09.455 --> 00:08:11.257
ON CHILDREN WHICH I WILL NOT GO

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:13.059
INTO BUT I THINK ONE OF THE

00:08:13.125 --> 00:08:16.195
LEADERS ANALYSTS WELL- BUT WHAT

00:08:16.262 --> 00:08:18.264
IS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IT'S MORE

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:26.138
COMPLICATED THAN VIOLENCE- MANY. PEOPLE THINK OF IT AS A WOMAN

00:08:26.205 --> 00:08:26.772
WITH A BLACK. BUT IT'S MORE THAN

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:29.542
IT'S SYSTEM HOW AND CONTROL. BUT

00:08:29.609 --> 00:08:31.444
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CAN OCCUR IN

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.112
ANY RELATIONSHIP NO MATTER

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:36.315
PERSON'S GENDER RACE CLASS OR

00:08:36.382 --> 00:08:38.317
TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP. WE MOST

00:08:38.384 --> 00:08:40.453
ABUSERS ARE MEN AND MOST VICTIMS

00:08:40.519 --> 00:08:42.955
ARE OR SURVIVORS ARE WOMEN AT

00:08:43.022 --> 00:08:45.258
WHICH MEANS I WILL USE THAT MALE

00:08:45.324 --> 00:08:46.993
PRONOUN FOR ABUSE AND THAT

00:08:47.059 --> 00:08:48.361
FEMALE PRONOUN FOR SURVIVOR BUT

00:08:48.427 --> 00:08:50.363
THAT IS NOT BY NO MEANS NOT

00:08:50.429 --> 00:08:52.999
ALWAYS THE CASE. AT ITS HEART

00:08:53.065 --> 00:08:54.800
THE MASTER VIOLENCE IS ABOUT

00:08:54.867 --> 00:08:56.702
POWER AND CONTROL BY THE VIEWS

00:08:56.769 --> 00:08:58.304
ARE OVER THE VICTOR AND THIS CAN

00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:00.006
TAKE MANY FORMS IT CAN BE

00:09:00.072 --> 00:09:03.276
PHYSICAL VIOLENCE- STRANGULATION

00:09:03.342 --> 00:09:04.677
IS PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS

00:09:04.744 --> 00:09:06.479
BECAUSE THAT'S OFTEN AN

00:09:06.545 --> 00:09:07.980
INDICATOR OF FUTURE LEGALITY.

00:09:08.047 --> 00:09:09.548
RECKLESS DRIVING AND BRANDISHING

00:09:09.615 --> 00:09:11.484
FIREARMS ARE REALLY VERY

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.686
DANGEROUS AS WELL A MOTIONAL

00:09:13.753 --> 00:09:15.454
ABUSE CALLING THE VICTIMS

00:09:15.521 --> 00:09:17.690
DEROGATORY NAMES TELL THEM

00:09:17.757 --> 00:09:19.558
NOTHING SHE CAN DO IS EVER RIGHT

00:09:19.625 --> 00:09:21.360
THE FOOD SHE COOKED IS TERRIBLE

00:09:21.427 --> 00:09:23.462
THE HOUSE IS A MAX. FINANCIAL

00:09:23.529 --> 00:09:26.332

SLASHING THE TIRES SO SHE CAN'T

GET TO WORK. GIVING A BREAKDOWN

00:09:39.211 --> 00:09:42.014

A RECURRING RECEIPTS FOR ALL

00:09:43.449 --> 00:09:45.151
PURCHASES ARE THREATENING

00:09:45.217 --> 00:09:47.486

ABUSE I THINK I MAY NOT LEAVE AN

00:11:36.228 --> 00:11:37.563

VICTIMS OFTEN REPORT THAT IT'S

00:11:50.309 --> 00:11:51.710
THE OTHER TYPES OF ISSUES THAT

00:11:51.777 --> 00:11:53.779
ARE ACTUALLY HARDER TO OVERCOME.

00:11:53.846 --> 00:11:55.681
A MOTIONAL ABUSE CAN BE VERY

00:11:55.748 --> 00:11:58.484
PSYCHOLOGICALLY DAMAGING. AND

00:11:58.551 --> 00:11:59.618

CANNOT BE RECTIFIED. I'M I

00:12:16.635 --> 00:12:18.370
SHOULD SAY THAT IT IS CERTAINLY

00:12:18.437 --> 00:12:20.873
TRUE THAT VIOLENCE IS VERY

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:22.942
IMPORTANT IT CAN LEAD TO DEATH

00:12:23.008 --> 00:12:25.344
IT DOES LEAD TO DEATH. IN

00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:26.545
PARTICULAR WHEN WOMEN ARE

00:12:26.612 --> 00:12:28.180
PREGNANT OR HAVE NEWBORN

00:12:28.247 --> 00:12:30.549

RIGHT IT'S A PARTICULARLY

00:12:32.618 --> 00:12:35.121
DANGEROUS TIME FOR VICTIMS. I'M

00:12:35.187 --> 00:12:37.156
ON THE ONE HAND JUST BECAUSE

00:12:37.223 --> 00:12:38.424
THERE IS SOME VIOLENCE IN A

00:12:38.491 --> 00:12:39.358
RELATIONSHIP IT DOESN'T

00:12:39.425 --> 00:12:40.993
NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:44.130
RELATIONSHIP. HAS TO MATCH THE

00:12:44.196 --> 00:12:45.030
PILOTS YOU REALLY HAVE TO LOOK

00:12:45.097 --> 00:12:48.134
AT. THIS PATTERN OF POWER AND

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.504
CONTROL AND USUALLY IF THIS IS A

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:52.538
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RELATIONSHIP

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:53.939
THERE'S GOING TO BE SOCIAL

00:12:54.006 --> 00:12:55.741
ISOLATION THERE'S GOING TO BE

00:12:55.808 --> 00:12:57.042
PSYCHOLOGICAL ABUSE THERE'S

00:12:57.109 --> 00:12:58.878
GOING TO BE FINANCIAL ABUSE.

00:12:58.944 --> 00:13:00.146
THERE'S GOING TO BE MANY

00:13:00.212 --> 00:13:02.181
DIFFERENT THINGS NOT JUST

00:13:02.248 --> 00:13:03.916
PHYSICAL VIOLENCE AT THE SAME

00:13:03.983 --> 00:13:05.351
TIME NOT ALL ABUSERS USE

00:13:05.417 --> 00:13:08.487
PHYSICAL VIOLENCE. OFTEN EITHER

00:13:08.554 --> 00:13:10.990
THE THREAT OF VIOLENCE- OR THE

00:13:11.056 --> 00:13:12.758
USE OF THE OTHER TACTICS I JUST

00:13:12.825 --> 00:13:14.894
MENTIONED. IS ENTIRELY

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.629
SUFFICIENT TO KEEP. HIM

00:13:16.695 --> 00:13:18.631
INTIMIDATED AND CONTROLLED AND

00:13:18.697 --> 00:13:23.402
PHYSICAL VIOLENCE. THE BEES OR

00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:24.203
SOMETHING DOESN'T NEED TO RESORT

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:25.971
TO- FINALLY BATTERS TEND TO.

00:13:26.038 --> 00:13:28.507
WELL I'M OFTEN A BATTERY MIGHT

00:13:28.574 --> 00:13:30.676
BE WELL EDUCATED SMART PUT

TOGETHER IMPOLITE VICTIMS MAY

00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:36.148
PRESENT VERY POORLY. YOU'RE VERY

00:13:36.215 --> 00:13:38.684
EMOTIONAL MAY NOT BE CAPABLE OF

00:13:38.751 --> 00:13:39.919
INTERACTING WELL WITH AUTHORITY

00:13:39.985 --> 00:13:41.120
FIGURES MAY HAVE TRAUMA

00:13:41.187 --> 00:13:43.255
RESPONSES AND COULD EVEN HAVE

00:13:43.322 --> 00:13:45.257
ABOUT SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEMS

00:13:45.324 --> 00:13:47.726
IN RESPONSE TO TRYING TO DEAL

00:13:47.793 --> 00:13:50.963
WITH THE ABUSE. OF THE QUESTIONS

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:52.431
WHY DON'T MAKE THEM SWEET- THE

00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:53.799
SHORT ANSWER IS A LOT OF TO

00:13:53.866 --> 00:13:57.937
LEAVE. HART AND PARTLY THIS GOES

00:13:58.003 --> 00:13:59.438
TO THE CYCLE OF DOMESTIC

00:13:59.505 --> 00:14:01.807
VIOLENCE THERE IS A CYCLE. OFTEN

00:14:01.874 --> 00:14:03.776
THERE'S INTERPRETER IT WAS THEN

00:14:03.842 --> 00:14:05.377
AND HE'S EARNED IT DOWN THERE'S

00:14:05.444 --> 00:14:07.680
A BUILD UP OF STRESS. THERE'S A

00:14:07.746 --> 00:14:10.049
TRIGGER OR RELEASE. STRESS

00:14:10.115 --> 00:14:11.417
RESULTING IN AN INCIDENT

00:14:11.483 --> 00:14:13.485
WETHERBY VIOLENCE OR NOT. AND

00:14:13.552 --> 00:14:15.154
THEN WE'LL BE A HONEYMOON. AND

00:14:15.221 --> 00:14:16.922
THESE CYCLES CAN OCCUR WITH ANY

00:14:16.989 --> 00:14:19.258
FREQUENCY ONE TODAY ONCE YOU'RE

00:14:19.325 --> 00:14:21.460
ONCE A MONTH. VICTIMS ALSO OFTEN

00:14:21.527 --> 00:14:22.828
STAY BECAUSE OF THAT HONEYMOON

00:14:22.895 --> 00:14:24.430
PERIOD BECAUSE THEY WANT THE

00:14:24.496 --> 00:14:26.532
MUSIC TO CHANGE BECAUSE HE IS

00:14:26.599 --> 00:14:27.900
THE FATHER OF THEIR CHILDREN.

00:14:27.967 --> 00:14:29.635
BUT AT THE SAME TIME OFTEN STAY

00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:30.502
BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO OTHER

00:14:30.569 --> 00:14:32.771
CHOICE. AT THIS POINT THEY MIGHT

00:14:32.838 --> 00:14:34.373
HAVE NO FAMILY NO FRIENDS NO

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.242
MONEY NO CAR NO HOUSE IN YOUR

00:14:36.308 --> 00:14:39.311
JOB. THERE'S NO WAY FOR THEM TO

00:14:39.378 --> 00:14:45.818
LEAVE. AND THEN FINALLY. MAY

00:14:45.884 --> 00:14:46.485
STAY BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE. IT IS

00:14:46.552 --> 00:14:48.520
TRULY SAY FOR THEM TO. IF THEY

00:14:48.587 --> 00:14:49.855
STAY HERE KILL HER YOU WILL KILL

00:14:49.922 --> 00:14:52.057
HER IN THE TWO- SORRY SHE LEAVES

00:14:52.124 --> 00:14:53.225
HE WILL KILL CHILDREN CHILDREN

00:14:53.292 --> 00:14:54.960
IF SHE STAYS SHE MIGHT BE ABLE

00:14:55.027 --> 00:14:56.428
TO AT LEAST DIRECT HIS VIOLENCE

00:14:56.495 --> 00:14:58.464
TOWARDS HER. RATHER THAN THE

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.899
CHILDREN OR MAKE ME BE ABLE TO

00:15:00.966 --> 00:15:03.302
PLACATE OR MODERATE VIOLENCE IN

00:15:03.369 --> 00:15:05.104
OTHER WAYS. AS A FINAL NOTE

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:07.206
SEPARATING FROM AN END USER IS

00:15:07.273 --> 00:15:10.009
THE MOST INTERESTING PROJECT.

00:15:10.075 --> 00:15:13.212
THAT IS WHEN EVERYONE GOES ON

00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:15.281
EVEN MOST DOWNS TRYING TO LEAVE

00:15:15.347 --> 00:15:16.749
MULTIPLE TIMES BEFORE THEIR

00:15:16.815 --> 00:15:20.552
ALTERNATELY SUCCESSFUL. IN

00:15:20.619 --> 00:15:21.887
LEADING END USER. THE DOMINANT

00:15:21.954 --> 00:15:23.055
TO THE SECOND PART OF MY

00:15:23.122 --> 00:15:24.923
PRESENTATION WHICH IS WHAT IS

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:25.858
THE FAMILY ABOUT HOW THE

00:15:25.924 --> 00:15:29.061
PROJECT. IT'S KNOWN AS

00:15:29.128 --> 00:15:31.096
AFTERSHOCKS YOUR SHORT AND IT'S

00:15:31.163 --> 00:15:32.965
A NONPROFIT LEGAL ORGANIZATION

00:15:33.032 --> 00:15:34.767
BASED IN OAKLAND. THAT SERVES

00:15:34.833 --> 00:15:37.036
ALL OF CALIFORNIA AND RECENTLY

00:15:37.102 --> 00:15:38.837
EXPANDED TO WASHINGTON STATE.

00:15:38.904 --> 00:15:40.639
ITS PRIMARY FOCUS IS ON FAMILY

00:15:40.706 --> 00:15:42.207
LAW WITH A SECONDARY FOCUS ON

00:15:42.274 --> 00:15:45.444
DEPENDENCY BUT IT'S A GOAL IS TO

00:15:45.511 --> 00:15:48.580
END TO THE INTERGENERATIONAL

00:15:48.647 --> 00:15:50.416
SILENT CYCLE OF MY- SPECIFICALLY

00:15:50.482 --> 00:15:51.784
. WORKING WITH AND IMPROVING OUR

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:54.787
LEGAL SYSTEM. BOTH OF THE TRIAL

00:15:54.853 --> 00:15:56.455
COURT LEVEL THAT MEANS FAMILY

00:15:56.522 --> 00:15:58.691
COURT AND DEPENDENCY COURT IN AT

00:15:58.757 --> 00:16:00.159
THE APPELLATE LEVEL WHICH MEANS

00:16:00.225 --> 00:16:02.528
ASKING THE COURT OF APPEAL IN

00:16:02.594 --> 00:16:04.430
CALIFORNIA TO STEP IN AND EITHER

00:16:04.496 --> 00:16:07.333
AFFIRM OR REVERSE TRIAL COURT

00:16:07.399 --> 00:16:09.201
DECISIONS IN ORDER TO HELP

00:16:09.268 --> 00:16:11.570
FURTHER PROTECT DOMESTIC

00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:13.238
VIOLENCE VICTIMS. IT'S A PRETTY

00:16:13.305 --> 00:16:16.375
NEW ORGANIZATION WAS FOUNDED IN

00:16:16.442 --> 00:16:17.009
TWENTY TWELVE BY TWO UC BERKELEY

00:16:17.076 --> 00:16:19.545
LAW STUDENTS. AND THE WHOLE IDEA

00:16:19.611 --> 00:16:21.647
BEHIND IT IS THAT CALIFORNIA THE

00:16:21.714 --> 00:16:23.115
CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE IS ONE OF

00:16:23.182 --> 00:16:23.716
THE MOST PROGRESSIVE

00:16:23.782 --> 00:16:25.217
LEGISLATURES IN THE WORLD WE

00:16:25.284 --> 00:16:26.885
HAVE SOME REALLY GOOD LAWS ON

00:16:26.952 --> 00:16:29.822
THE BOOKS TO PROTECT DOMESTIC

00:16:29.888 --> 00:16:31.256
VIOLENCE VICTIMS. BUT THEY ARE

00:16:31.323 --> 00:16:33.258
NOT BEING ENFORCED IN TRIAL

00:16:33.325 --> 00:16:36.095
COURT. NOT ALL. BUT SOME OF THEM

00:16:36.161 --> 00:16:37.696
AND SO THAT WAS FOUNDED TO BE

00:16:37.763 --> 00:16:40.733
LIKE HEY THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME.

00:16:40.799 --> 00:16:43.035
ORGANIZATION HERE TO TRY AND

00:16:43.102 --> 00:16:44.937
ENCOURAGE TRIAL COURT JUDGES TO

00:16:45.003 --> 00:16:47.206
ACTUALLY APPLY THESE LAWS AND TO

00:16:47.272 --> 00:16:48.841
APPLY THEM IN THE RIGHT WAY

00:16:48.907 --> 00:16:50.642
LATER THEY JUST SET YOUR

00:16:50.709 --> 00:16:51.744
INTENDED TO PROTECT. AND

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:53.345
SOMETIMES THAT MEANS APPEALING

00:16:53.412 --> 00:16:55.314
THOSE DECISIONS. AND GETTING THE

00:16:55.381 --> 00:16:56.815
COURT OF APPEAL TO TELL TRIAL

00:16:56.882 --> 00:16:58.384
JUDGES HATE YOU GOT SOMETHING

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:00.419
WRONG. OR SOMETIMES IN CASES

00:17:00.486 --> 00:17:02.855
THIS HEY YOU GOT SOMETHING RIGHT

00:17:02.921 --> 00:17:03.389
ESPECIALLY WHEN AN ABUSER

00:17:03.455 --> 00:17:07.359
APPEALS. A TRIAL COURT DECISION

00:17:07.426 --> 00:17:08.761
THAT WENT AGAINST HIM. IN TERMS

00:17:08.827 --> 00:17:11.964
OF DEPENDENCY THAT WILL STEP IN

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:16.101
WILL FILE AMICUS BRIEFS AMICUS.

00:17:16.168 --> 00:17:18.871
IN CERTAIN- DEPENDENCY APPEALS

00:17:18.937 --> 00:17:22.040
AND WE WILL ALSO REQUEST PUBLIC

00:17:22.107 --> 00:17:23.642
. UNPUBLISHED ORDER THE PEOPLE'S

00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:26.512
CASES THAT WE BELIEVE WILL

00:17:26.578 --> 00:17:29.081
REMOVE DEPENDENCY CASE LAW COURT

00:17:29.148 --> 00:17:31.950
WILL BETTER PROTECT VICTIMS OF

00:17:32.017 --> 00:17:34.086
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. SO NOW I'M I

00:17:34.153 --> 00:17:34.953
DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME BUT

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:36.221
I'M NOT SURE AND SHE FINALLY

00:17:36.288 --> 00:17:38.290
WHAT ARE YOU KNOW WE'RE DOES

00:17:38.357 --> 00:17:41.760
AFFECT. WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT IN

00:17:41.827 --> 00:17:43.295
TERMS OF CHILD WELFARE AND

00:17:43.362 --> 00:17:45.764
DEPENDENCY SYSTEM WE WOULD LIKE

00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:48.434
TO SEE MORE CHILDREN KEPT WITH

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.402
NON OFFENDING SURVIVOR PARENTS

00:17:50.469 --> 00:17:52.104
CHILDREN SHOULD NOT BE

00:17:52.171 --> 00:17:54.139
PHYSICALLY REMOVED FROM VICTIM

00:17:54.206 --> 00:17:56.642
KAREN UNLESS IT IS ABSOLUTELY

00:17:56.708 --> 00:17:58.343
NECESSARY CHILDREN WHO HAVE

00:17:58.410 --> 00:17:59.812
WITNESSED OR EXPERIENCED

00:17:59.878 --> 00:18:02.948
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN THE HOME

00:18:03.015 --> 00:18:03.582
HAVE ALREADY UNDERGONE A LOT OF

00:18:03.649 --> 00:18:05.884
. AND REMOVING THEM FROM THE

00:18:05.951 --> 00:18:07.386
PROTECTIVE PARENTS THE ONLY

00:18:07.453 --> 00:18:08.554
PARENT THAT HAS STOOD UP FOR

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:10.556
THEM AND HELP THEM. IS A MOTHER

00:18:10.622 --> 00:18:12.925
OR FATHER IS DOING ADDITIONAL

00:18:12.991 --> 00:18:15.127
HARM ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT THEY

00:18:15.194 --> 00:18:17.362
WENT THROUGH BY EXPERIENCING

00:18:17.429 --> 00:18:18.797
THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. HOW DOES

00:18:18.864 --> 00:18:20.599
THIS COME UP. WHERE DO WE SEE

00:18:20.666 --> 00:18:23.035
THIS INTERESTING VIOLENCE CASES.

00:18:23.101 --> 00:18:24.236
WE TYPICALLY SEE THAT'S WHERE

00:18:24.303 --> 00:18:26.472
THE NON OFFENDING VICTIM PARENT

00:18:26.538 --> 00:18:28.474
IS ALLEGED TO HAVE FAILED TO

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:31.109
PROTECT THE CHILD. DEPENDENCY

00:18:31.176 --> 00:18:33.812
COURT WILL COME IN. AND TAKE

00:18:33.879 --> 00:18:36.248
JURISDICTION OVER CHILD BASED ON

00:18:36.315 --> 00:18:39.384
CERTAIN- YOU KNOW STATUTES THE

00:18:39.451 --> 00:18:41.186
WELFARE AND INSTITUTIONS CODE.

00:18:41.253 --> 00:18:43.388
AND ONE OF THEM IS IF YOU FAILED

00:18:43.455 --> 00:18:46.058
TO PROTECT A CHILD FROM- YOU

00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:47.960
KNOW DANGEROUS BEHAVIOR FROM

00:18:48.026 --> 00:18:51.163
ANOTHER PERSON OR A STUDENT.

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:54.666
AND- OFTEN ALTERNATELY CHILDREN

00:18:54.733 --> 00:18:56.468
ARE REMOVED FROM THE VICTIM'S

00:18:56.535 --> 00:18:58.270
PARENTS BECAUSE THE CHILD

00:18:58.337 --> 00:19:00.272
WELFARE AGENCY ALLEGES THAT THE

00:19:00.339 --> 00:19:02.140
JUDGE AGREES THAT THE VICTIM'S

00:19:02.207 --> 00:19:04.376
PARENTS. CHECK THE CHILD FROM

00:19:04.443 --> 00:19:07.212
WITNESSING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SO

00:19:07.279 --> 00:19:11.783
WHAT WHAT. THIS DOESN'T COMPORT

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:13.585
WITH WHAT IS BEST FOR CHILDREN

00:19:13.652 --> 00:19:15.787
AND WE BELIEVE THAT THERE SHOULD

00:19:15.854 --> 00:19:17.089
NOT BE JURISDICTION OVER

00:19:17.155 --> 00:19:18.857
VICTIM'S PARENTS FOR FAILURE TO

00:19:18.924 --> 00:19:20.926
PROTECT FROM DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:22.828
IN AND OF ITSELF. TELL YOUR TO

00:19:22.895 --> 00:19:24.396
PROTECT FROM ACTUAL PHYSICAL

00:19:24.463 --> 00:19:26.565
ABUSE OR SEXUAL ABUSE IS ANOTHER

00:19:26.632 --> 00:19:28.100
MATTER AND THAT'S CERTAINLY

00:19:28.166 --> 00:19:30.869
SHOULD STILL BE IN THE LAW BUT

00:19:30.936 --> 00:19:33.038
THIS FELT THE CURRENT PRACTICE

00:19:33.105 --> 00:19:35.507
OF REMOVING PARENTS FROM PROJECT

00:19:35.574 --> 00:19:37.509
PROMOTES A WHOLE HOST HAS A

00:19:37.576 --> 00:19:39.344
WHOLE HOST OF BACKGROUNDS ARTS.

00:19:39.411 --> 00:19:42.014
I'M OFTEN NUMBER ONE IT OFTEN

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.015
PROMOTES AN INCORRECT

00:19:43.081 --> 00:19:44.016
UNDERSTANDING OF DOMESTIC

00:19:44.082 --> 00:19:47.486
VIOLENCE. THAT'S LIMITED TO

00:19:47.553 --> 00:19:48.153
PHYSICAL. SOCIAL WORKER

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:49.154
TYPICALLY DON'T SEE ALL OF THE

00:19:49.221 --> 00:19:50.689
OTHER TACTICS THAT I MENTIONED

00:19:50.756 --> 00:19:53.091
ABOUT THEIR ONLY RESPONDING TO

00:19:53.158 --> 00:19:56.728
PHYSICAL VIOLENCE- PUNISHES THE

00:19:56.795 --> 00:19:59.264
VICTIM HER ACT. IT'S BASED ON

00:19:59.331 --> 00:20:00.532
THE INCORRECT ASSUMPTION THAT

00:20:00.599 --> 00:20:02.134
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS A MUTUAL OF

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.635
ACTS THAT BOTH PARTIES ARE

00:20:03.702 --> 00:20:06.705
EQUALLY RESPONSIBLE AND THEY

00:20:06.772 --> 00:20:08.273
CONTROL THE KIND. THE VICTIM

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:10.475
PARENT MAY. HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE

00:20:10.542 --> 00:20:12.911
TO PROTECT THE CHILD AND NOW

00:20:12.978 --> 00:20:14.580
SHE'S ALLEGED TO HAVE FAILED TO

00:20:14.646 --> 00:20:16.815
PROTECT THE CHILD. THE VICTIM

00:20:16.882 --> 00:20:19.017
PARENT MAY INDEED HAVE PROTECTED

00:20:19.084 --> 00:20:21.119
THE CHILD BY SAY TAKING AN

00:20:21.186 --> 00:20:24.323
ABUSER'S VIOLENCE AND DIRECTING

00:20:24.389 --> 00:20:25.223
THEM TO HER AND NOT THE CHILD.

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:27.292
AND SHE'S TO HAVE FAILED THE

00:20:27.359 --> 00:20:30.596
CHILD. IT CURRENT FOR REPORTING

00:20:30.662 --> 00:20:32.698
ABUSE AND THIS IS REALLY REALLY

00:20:32.764 --> 00:20:35.067
IMPORTANT IF A VICTIM PARENT

00:20:35.133 --> 00:20:36.835
CALLS THE POLICE TO REPORT THE

00:20:36.902 --> 00:20:39.271
VIOLENCE THE POLICE OFTEN WILL

00:20:39.338 --> 00:20:41.273
CROSS REFER TO CBS THEN THERE'S

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.375
A DANGER OF DEPENDENCIES IS

00:20:43.442 --> 00:20:45.677
INSTITUTED A SURVIVOR IS GOING

00:20:45.744 --> 00:20:46.311
TO BE SEPARATED FROM HER

00:20:46.378 --> 00:20:48.647
CHILDREN AND SHE MAY BE

00:20:48.714 --> 00:20:50.215
SEPARATED EVEN AT THE SAME TIME

00:20:50.282 --> 00:20:53.619
WHEN THE PROSECUTION'S REQUIRING

00:20:53.685 --> 00:20:54.820
HER TO TESTIFY. I'M USERS NO

00:20:54.886 --> 00:20:56.588
THAT'S OKAY AND THEY WILL TELL

00:20:56.655 --> 00:20:59.057
VICTIM DON'T POLICE YOU CALL

00:20:59.124 --> 00:21:00.492
THE POLICE THE SECOND REPUBLICAN

00:21:00.559 --> 00:21:02.995
BC YES WE OUT HERE AND YOUR KIDS

00:21:03.061 --> 00:21:06.698
WILL BE TAKEN AWAY. AND SO THIS

00:21:06.765 --> 00:21:08.967
IS A REAL BIG CONSIDERATION- IT

00:21:09.034 --> 00:21:11.370
WHAT. WE MEANS HAVING THIS

00:21:11.436 --> 00:21:13.605
FAILURE TO PROTECT CASE LAW IN

00:21:13.672 --> 00:21:15.807
HERE STATUTE IT DISSUADES

00:21:15.874 --> 00:21:17.309
VICTIMS FROM COMING FORWARD

00:21:17.376 --> 00:21:21.046
REPORTING YES- AND THEN WHEN THE

00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:23.548
VICTIM DOESN'T REPORT THE ABUSE

00:21:23.615 --> 00:21:25.384
ONE OF THEM DOESN'T CALL THE

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:27.252
POLICE ON SOMEONE ELSE'S STATUS.

00:21:27.319 --> 00:21:28.954
THE VICTIM IS STILL SEPARATED

00:21:29.021 --> 00:21:29.855
FROM THEIR CHILDREN BECAUSE

00:21:29.921 --> 00:21:31.490
EMPLOYEES DO GET CALLED IN AND

00:21:31.556 --> 00:21:32.624
SHE'S TOLD SHE SHOULD HAVE

00:21:32.691 --> 00:21:35.293
CALLED THE POLICE. IT'S A CATCH

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.461
TWENTY TWO AND THERE'S NO WAY

00:21:36.528 --> 00:21:41.667
FOR A SURVIVOR TO ACT THAT DOES. NOT PUT THEM AT RISK.

00:21:41.733 --> 00:21:43.035
ULTIMATELY I THINK. THIS IS A

00:21:43.101 --> 00:21:44.536
POINT OFF LOSSES TO PROTECT

00:21:44.603 --> 00:21:45.404
PUBLISHES THE CHILDREN FOR THE

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:48.006
ACTS OF THE ABUSE- YOU KNOW GIVE

00:21:48.073 --> 00:21:50.108
A CHILD IS. AND I ALREADY SAID

00:21:50.175 --> 00:21:50.776
THIS BEFORE BUT I'M GONNA SAY IT

00:21:50.842 --> 00:21:52.878
AGAIN. IT'S PUNISHING THE

00:21:52.944 --> 00:21:55.447
CHILDREN THE CHILD IS REMOVED

00:21:55.514 --> 00:21:56.248
FROM THE ONLY PROTECTED

CURRENTLY KNOWN AND PLACED IN A

00:21:57.883 --> 00:22:01.319
FOSTER. IN THE FOSTER CARE

00:22:01.386 --> 00:22:03.021
SYSTEM. IT THAT'S NOT RIGHT IT'S

00:22:03.088 --> 00:22:04.256
NOT THE BEST INTEREST OF THE

00:22:04.322 --> 00:22:05.724
CHILD IT IS FUNDAMENTALLY

00:22:05.791 --> 00:22:10.328
DAMAGING. AND THEN FINALLY- YOUR

00:22:10.395 --> 00:22:11.797
PROTECTORS DICTION WHEN

00:22:11.863 --> 00:22:13.532
DEPENDENCY COURTS COME IN

00:22:13.598 --> 00:22:15.500
THEY'RE REALLY ONLY SUPPOSED TO

00:22:15.567 --> 00:22:17.302
REMOVE A CHILD OR EVEN ASSUME

00:22:17.369 --> 00:22:19.905
JURISDICTION OVER CHILD IF THERE

00:22:19.971 --> 00:22:22.474
IS A CURRENT RISK OF HARM TO THE

00:22:22.541 --> 00:22:25.343
CHILD. HELLO OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:27.212
IS THAT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN

00:22:27.279 --> 00:22:29.147
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND FAMILY BUT

00:22:29.214 --> 00:22:31.783
THE VICTIM BY THE TIME IT GETS

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:33.618

00:22:33.685 --> 00:22:35.987

RESTRAINING ORDER MAYBE SHE'S IN

00:22:37.622 --> 00:22:39.591
A SHELTER MAYBE SHE HASN'T SEEN

00:22:39.658 --> 00:22:41.927
THE ABUSER FOR FOUR MONTHS-

00:22:41.993 --> 00:22:44.629
XCERRA. AND YET THE DEPENDENCY

00:22:44.696 --> 00:22:46.832
COURT STILL ASSUMES JURISDICTION

00:22:46.898 --> 00:22:48.166
OVER THAT CHILD STILL SAYS THERE

00:22:48.233 --> 00:22:50.102
IS A CURRENT RISK OF HEART WHEN

00:22:50.168 --> 00:22:52.671
THE VICTIMS LIKE. I SEPARATED I

00:22:52.738 --> 00:22:54.439

00:22:54.506 --> 00:22:56.308
DO I AM NOW IN A SHELTER I HAVE

00:22:56.374 --> 00:22:57.909
A RESTRAINING ORDER OPERATING

00:22:57.976 --> 00:22:59.444
WITH THE PROSECUTION AND YOU ARE

00:22:59.511 --> 00:23:04.116
STILL TELLING ME. THAT I FAILED

00:23:04.182 --> 00:23:04.750
TO PROTECT MY CHILD. IT IS NOT

00:23:04.816 --> 00:23:07.819
EXACT. YEAH CONVINCE VICTIMS TO

00:23:07.886 --> 00:23:09.454
TRUST YOU KNOW GOVERNMENTAL

00:23:09.521 --> 00:23:12.891
AUTHORITIES OR OR- OR AGENCIES

00:23:12.958 --> 00:23:16.061
AND A FUTURE SO. IF WE ARE GOING

00:23:16.128 --> 00:23:18.096
TO MAINTAIN. THIS FAILURE TO.

00:23:18.163 --> 00:23:19.898
PROTECT LANGUAGE AS IT IS

00:23:19.965 --> 00:23:22.467
CURRENTLY. NOW IN THE LAW THERE

00:23:22.534 --> 00:23:24.369
NEEDS TO BE MORE OF AN EMPHASIS

00:23:24.436 --> 00:23:27.105
ON CURRENT RISK THE CHILD JUST

00:23:27.172 --> 00:23:29.141
BECAUSE THERE IS PAST HARM. DOES

00:23:29.207 --> 00:23:32.444
NOT MEAN THAT THERE WILL BE

00:23:32.511 --> 00:23:35.180
FUTURE CAR- AND ALSO I HAVE SEEN

00:23:35.247 --> 00:23:37.215
AT BOTH JUDGES AND CHILD WELFARE

00:23:37.282 --> 00:23:42.420
AGENCIES. ONCE IS A WELL

00:23:42.487 --> 00:23:44.022
DOCUMENTED FACT AND YOUR

00:23:44.089 --> 00:23:46.558
RELATIONSHIPS TO ARGUE THAT-

00:23:46.625 --> 00:23:47.759
WELL THE VICTIMS ONLY BEEN

00:23:47.826 --> 00:23:49.194

GONNA GO BACK TO HIM SO

00:23:50.662 --> 00:23:53.098
THEREFORE WE HAVE TO STEP IN AND

00:23:53.165 --> 00:23:54.966
WE HAVE TO ASSUME JURISDICTION

00:23:55.033 --> 00:23:57.502
OR REMOVE THE CHILD. BUT BECAUSE

00:23:57.569 --> 00:23:59.971
WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT SITE IS

00:24:00.038 --> 00:24:01.139
BROKEN. IT'S NOT THE RIGHT WAY

00:24:01.206 --> 00:24:03.441
OF THINKING ABOUT IT- THERE ARE

00:24:03.508 --> 00:24:05.076
PLENTY OF OTHER WAYS A CHILD

00:24:05.143 --> 00:24:08.246
WELFARE AGENCY CANTOR INFORMALLY

00:24:08.313 --> 00:24:11.049
SUPERVISOR FAMILY. I AM AT

00:24:11.116 --> 00:24:12.651
TAKING JURISDICTION OR REMOVING

00:24:12.717 --> 00:24:15.520
A CHILD FROM A PARENT SHOULD BE

00:24:15.587 --> 00:24:18.323
THE LAST SHOULD BE DRASTIC.

00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:21.560
MEASURES THAT ARE ONLY TAKEN

00:24:21.626 --> 00:24:23.929
UNDER EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES- I

00:24:23.995 --> 00:24:27.265
HAVE PLENTY OF HER COMMENTS BUT

00:24:27.332 --> 00:24:29.100
MY TIME IS UP. B. TO TAKE

00:24:29.167 --> 00:24:31.203
QUESTIONS- I WILL NOTE THAT I

00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:33.371
WILL HAVE TO SIGN OFF AT ELEVEN

00:24:38.176 --> 00:24:41.246

SO MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH ON

00:24:46.551 --> 00:24:48.787
YOUR FOR YOUR TESTIMONY- YOU

00:24:48.854 --> 00:24:50.222
TOUCHED ON A LOT OF ISSUES THAT

00:24:50.288 --> 00:24:53.525
ARE. REALLY SIGNIFICANT- FIRST

00:24:53.592 --> 00:24:54.626
OF POWER AND CONTROL THAT YOU

00:24:54.693 --> 00:24:56.528
DISCUSSED- I'D LIKE TO TAKE A

00:24:56.595 --> 00:24:58.263
MOMENT EVERY SINGLE TIME WHEN I

00:24:58.330 --> 00:24:59.364
DO TALK TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

00:24:59.431 --> 00:25:00.932
JUST TO HIGHLIGHT. EVERYTHING

00:25:00.999 --> 00:25:02.300
THAT YOU ADDRESS IN TERMS OF

00:25:02.367 --> 00:25:04.102
POWER AND CONTROL AND HOW WE

00:25:04.169 --> 00:25:06.438
HAVE THIS MISCONCEPTION OF WHAT

00:25:06.504 --> 00:25:07.806
IS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND A LOT

00:25:07.873 --> 00:25:09.674
OF TIMES IT'S- ODD THE POWER

00:25:09.741 --> 00:25:11.409
CONTROL THAT HAPPENS BEFORE THE

00:25:11.476 --> 00:25:12.878
PHYSICAL ASSAULT BY WAY OF

00:25:12.944 --> 00:25:15.113
EXAMPLE EITHER. CHOOSING WHO AT

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:16.715
THE FRIENDS ARE ISOLATING PEOPLE

00:25:16.781 --> 00:25:18.250
FROM THEIR FROM THEIR FAMILY AND

00:25:18.316 --> 00:25:19.584
FRIENDS AND SO I ALWAYS LIKE TO

00:25:19.651 --> 00:25:20.285
TELL PARENTS WHO THEY'RE

00:25:20.352 --> 00:25:22.320
LISTENING WE USED TO ASK

00:25:22.387 --> 00:25:23.655
TEENAGERS HAVE YOU BEEN

00:25:23.722 --> 00:25:25.690
ASSAULTED. HOW'S YOUR BOYFRIEND

00:25:25.757 --> 00:25:27.259
OR SIGNIFICANT OTHER ASSAULTED

00:25:27.325 --> 00:25:28.360
YOU BUT I THINK WE NEED TO

00:25:28.426 --> 00:25:30.228
CHANGE THE WAY WE ADDRESS THAT

00:25:30.295 --> 00:25:32.564
AND ALSO ASK IS YOUR- BOYFRIEND

00:25:32.631 --> 00:25:34.866
OR GIRLFRIEND COURSING YOU ARE

00:25:34.933 --> 00:25:35.934
THEY CHOOSING YOUR FRIENDS FOR

00:25:36.001 --> 00:25:37.235
YOU ARE THEY TAKING YOUR PHONES

00:25:37.302 --> 00:25:38.303
AWAY FROM YOU SO I'D LIKE TO

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:40.105
JUST. PUT THAT OUT THERE BECAUSE

00:25:40.171 --> 00:25:42.207
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE. THE

00:25:42.274 --> 00:25:43.942
COERCION HAPPENS WAY BEFORE THE

00:25:44.009 --> 00:25:45.677
PHYSICAL ASSAULT THANK YOU FOR

00:25:45.744 --> 00:25:46.945
EVERYTHING THAT YOU SHARED AND I

00:25:47.012 --> 00:25:47.746
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE

00:25:47.812 --> 00:25:50.282
THAT. WE HAVE TO CHANGE OUR

00:25:50.348 --> 00:25:51.983
MINDSET WHAT IS DOMESTIC

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:53.852
VIOLENCE I ALSO APPRECIATE THE

00:25:53.919 --> 00:25:55.320
FACT THAT YOU BROUGHT FAILURE TO

00:25:55.387 --> 00:25:56.354
PROTECT WHICH IS AN ISSUE THAT

00:25:56.421 --> 00:25:58.256
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO. TO DELVE

00:25:58.323 --> 00:26:00.625
INTO AND RESOLVE I THINK THAT WE

00:26:00.692 --> 00:26:03.128
SHOULDN'T BE. OB TRAUMATIZING A

00:26:03.194 --> 00:26:04.930
VICTIM TWICE IN THE FIRST BY THE

00:26:04.996 --> 00:26:07.132
ASSAULT SECOND BY REMOVING A

00:26:07.198 --> 00:26:08.633
CHILD THAT SHOULD BE WITH THE

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:10.869
NON ABUSIVE PARENT AND SO WE

00:26:10.936 --> 00:26:12.237
DEFINITELY TO LOOK INTOIT. I

00:26:12.304 --> 00:26:17.342
WANT TO TURN IT OVER TO- SENATOR

00:26:17.409 --> 00:26:17.976

00:26:18.043 --> 00:26:19.577
THANK YOU- I'M GONNA DECIDE WHEN

00:26:19.644 --> 00:26:22.347
QUESTION I OBVIOUSLY I'M REALLY

00:26:22.414 --> 00:26:25.684
INTERESTED IN THIS THE. THE

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:26.851
POINT YOU MADE ON THE ABOUT THE

00:26:26.918 --> 00:26:28.553
FAILURE TO PROTECT AND HOW THAT

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:30.288
HURTS THE CHILDREN PUNISHES THE

00:26:30.355 --> 00:26:31.489
CHILDREN AND THE VICTIM SO

00:26:31.556 --> 00:26:33.591
DEFINITELY WE'LL TALK MORE WITH

00:26:33.658 --> 00:26:36.227
THAT MY CHAIR ABOUT HOW WE MIGHT

00:26:36.294 --> 00:26:38.063
PURSUE TRYING TO FIX THAT BUT-

00:26:38.129 --> 00:26:39.965
THE OTHER LINE I WANTED TO JUST

00:26:40.031 --> 00:26:41.499
ASK NOW IT'S NOT THE FOCUS OF

00:26:41.566 --> 00:26:43.234
THE HEARING PER SE BUT T'S- IT

00:26:43.301 --> 00:26:47.339
BEARS ON ALL OF THIS. IS OUR OUR

00:26:47.405 --> 00:26:50.308
LAWS NOW ADEQUATE FOR DEALING

00:26:50.375 --> 00:26:52.344
WITH THIS COERCIVE ASPECT IS

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:54.546
CONTROLLING ASPECT OF DOMESTIC

00:26:54.612 --> 00:26:58.416
VIOLENCE. ON SENATOR RUBIO FOR

00:26:58.483 --> 00:27:00.919
EXAMPLE HAD A BILL. THAT I

00:27:00.986 --> 00:27:02.253
WORKED WITH HER- AND I THINK IT

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:05.323
WAS MEAN COLLECTOR BUT- WHERE WE

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:09.094
RECOGNIZED THAT. THERE WAS A

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.996
LACK OF ACKNOWLEDGEMENT WITHIN

00:27:11.062 --> 00:27:13.031
OUR STATE PENAL CODE AND WITH

00:27:13.098 --> 00:27:14.866
OBVIOUSLY WITHIN THE- LAW

00:27:14.933 --> 00:27:17.102
ENFORCEMENT FOR. THE TYPE OF

00:27:17.168 --> 00:27:18.436
CONTROL OVER THE TYPE OF

00:27:18.503 --> 00:27:20.238
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THAT ISN'T

00:27:20.305 --> 00:27:21.973
THAT DOESN'T LEAVE PHYSICAL

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:24.676
SCARS BUT IS THAT CONTROLLING

00:27:24.743 --> 00:27:27.045
DEBT IS VERY EXTRAORDINARILY

00:27:27.112 --> 00:27:29.814
DAMAGING. AND SO  WONDERED IF

00:27:29.881 --> 00:27:31.716
YOU FELT THAT WE HAVE

00:27:31.783 --> 00:27:36.287
ADEQUATELY- FIXED OUR PENAL CODE

00:27:36.354 --> 00:27:39.691
TO RECOGNIZE THAT PART. OF

00:27:39.758 --> 00:27:42.594
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. I THANK YOU

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:43.628
SENATOR CENTERED SKINNER FOR

00:27:43.695 --> 00:27:46.464
THAT QUESTION I AM GOING TO HAVE

00:27:46.531 --> 00:27:47.332
TO GET BACK TO YOU BECAUSE THAT

00:27:47.399 --> 00:27:52.037
IS. AN EXCELLENT QUESTION AND- I

00:27:52.103 --> 00:27:53.872
NEED TO LOOK INTO IT FURTHER I

00:27:53.938 --> 00:27:55.974
DIDN'T PROVIDE I DIDN'T REVIEW

00:27:56.041 --> 00:27:57.776
THAT RIGHT BEFORE THE HEARING

00:27:57.842 --> 00:28:00.178
THE STORIES. I WILL BOTH THE

00:28:00.245 --> 00:28:01.379
JOURNAL INTEREST IN THAT FOR THE

00:28:01.446 --> 00:28:03.581
FUTURE AND I THINK THAT WHAT WE-

00:28:03.648 --> 00:28:04.949
ARE YOU KNOW I MEAN LOOK YOU

00:28:05.016 --> 00:28:09.320
CAN'T IT'S- IT ABUSERS. WHATEVER

00:28:09.387 --> 00:28:11.856
THE- THERE'S LOTS OF TOOLS THEY

00:28:11.923 --> 00:28:14.259
CAN USE BUT I THINK WHAT WITH.

00:28:14.325 --> 00:28:16.628
THINGS LIKE SOCIAL MEDIA NOW THE

00:28:16.694 --> 00:28:20.932
ABILITY TO MORE EASILY. FIVE

00:28:20.999 --> 00:28:24.602
SURVEIL YOUR- YOUR VICTIM THE

00:28:24.669 --> 00:28:26.204
PERSON YOU ARE TRYING TO

00:28:26.271 --> 00:28:28.273
CONTROL. THAT THERE'S- THERE CAN

00:28:28.339 --> 00:28:30.642
BE THIS THAT MANY MORE FORMS OF

00:28:30.708 --> 00:28:32.777
THAT CONTROLLING COERCIVE

00:28:32.844 --> 00:28:36.414
BEHAVIOUR. SO I THINK AND YET IT

00:28:36.481 --> 00:28:38.883
IS. EASILY IF NOT EVEN MORE

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:42.287
DAMAGING THAN PHYSICAL VIOLENCE

00:28:42.353 --> 00:28:44.089
. I WILL SAY THAT TECHNOLOGICAL

00:28:44.155 --> 00:28:46.758
ABUSE AS YOU TOUCHED ON IS

00:28:46.825 --> 00:28:48.793
RISING- ESPECIALLY AS THE

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:50.462
YOUNGER GENERATION USE

00:28:50.528 --> 00:28:53.364
TECHNOLOGY MORE AND MORE. AND IT

00:28:53.431 --> 00:28:54.299
IS SOMETHING THAT OUR LAW

00:28:54.365 --> 00:28:55.767
ENFORCEMENT AND THE COURTS ARE

00:28:55.834 --> 00:28:57.469
GENERALLY ILL EQUIPPED TO DEAL

00:28:57.535 --> 00:29:00.572
WITH- WHETHER THAT'S BECAUSE IT

00:29:00.638 --> 00:29:03.475
REQUIRES COMPUTER FORENSICS TO

00:29:03.541 --> 00:29:06.044
TRACE SAY IT DAMAGING POST BACK

00:29:06.111 --> 00:29:09.414
TO AN END USER'S COMPUTER- OR-

00:29:09.481 --> 00:29:11.149
SIMPLY SOME TECHNOLOGICAL KNOW

00:29:11.216 --> 00:29:14.185
HOW. IT'S OFTEN BEYOND MOST

00:29:14.252 --> 00:29:16.688
JUDGES ABUSERS AND STARED SORRY

00:29:16.754 --> 00:29:19.357
MOST JUDGES AND POLICE OFFICERS

00:29:19.424 --> 00:29:20.458
TO SIMPLY SIMPLY LACK THE

00:29:20.525 --> 00:29:22.594
RESOURCES TO INVESTIGATE AND SO

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:24.229
I THINK THE FIRST THING THAT

00:29:24.295 --> 00:29:24.929
CAME TO MY MIND WHEN I HEARD

00:29:24.996 --> 00:29:30.034
YOUR QUESTION IS. IT'S ALMOST-

00:29:30.101 --> 00:29:30.602
THE LAWS WE HAVE ON THE BOOK

00:29:30.668 --> 00:29:33.138
RIGHT NOW. CERTAINLY CAN BE

00:29:33.204 --> 00:29:35.140
IMPROVED BUT IT'S ON THE GROUND

00:29:35.206 --> 00:29:36.374
ENFORCEMENT HOW ARE THEY GONNA

00:29:36.441 --> 00:29:38.409
GET ENFORCED WHO IS GOING TO

00:29:38.476 --> 00:29:41.679
ENFORCE THAT- AND I THINK THAT

00:29:41.746 --> 00:29:43.848
OFTEN JUDGES AND POLICE OFFICERS

00:29:43.915 --> 00:29:45.283
AND YU JUST NEED TO GET JUST

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:46.451
LOOK THE OTHER WAY THEY CAN'T

00:29:46.518 --> 00:29:47.752
DEAL WITH THAT THEY CAN DEAL

00:29:47.819 --> 00:29:49.554
WITH A BLACK EYE. THEY CANNOT

00:29:49.621 --> 00:29:51.422
DEAL WITH THE VICTIM SAYING HE

00:29:51.489 --> 00:29:53.525
POSTED IT- YOU KNOW NAKED PHOTOS

00:29:53.591 --> 00:29:55.160
HE TOOK WITHOUT MY CONSENT TO

00:29:55.226 --> 00:29:56.828
GRINDER WHICH HAPPENS ALL THE

00:29:56.895 --> 00:30:02.767
TIME. AND IT'S- THE- AN END.

00:30:02.834 --> 00:30:04.802
COME HOME. OXFORD PEOPLE ON THE

00:30:04.869 --> 00:30:08.173
GROUND. AM I THINK THAT TODAY

00:30:08.239 --> 00:30:09.274
THE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND AND I'M

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:10.575
TALKING TO POLICE OFFICERS AND

00:30:10.642 --> 00:30:12.377
SOCIAL WORKERS. THEY KNOW THAT

00:30:12.443 --> 00:30:13.411
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS BAD AND

00:30:13.478 --> 00:30:15.380
THAT IS THAT'S GREAT BECAUSE

00:30:15.446 --> 00:30:16.447
FORTY YEARS AGO WE WERE NOT

00:30:16.514 --> 00:30:18.850
THERE. BUT THEY DON'T

00:30:18.917 --> 00:30:20.451
NECESSARILY KNOW THAT DOMESTIC

00:30:20.518 --> 00:30:21.986
VIOLENCE IS NOT JUST PHYSICAL

00:30:22.053 --> 00:30:23.021
VIOLENCE SAYS THERE'S AN

00:30:23.087 --> 00:30:24.489
EDUCATION AND TRAINING

00:30:24.556 --> 00:30:26.357
COMPONENT. AND THEN THERE'S A

00:30:26.424 --> 00:30:28.893
RESOURCE COMPONENT- SAY THERE IS

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.828
TERRIBLE TECHNOLOGICAL ABUSE WHO

00:30:30.895 --> 00:30:34.732
WHO'S GOING TO PROSECUTE.

00:30:34.799 --> 00:30:35.366
BATTERY WAS GONNA LOOK INTO THAT

00:30:35.433 --> 00:30:37.101
. SO I WILL BACK TO SPECIFIC

00:30:37.168 --> 00:30:39.037
REMARKS DOES THAT MY TAKE. THIS

00:30:39.103 --> 00:30:40.271
IS BECAUSE A LINE OF INQUIRY

00:30:40.338 --> 00:30:42.273
THAT WE CAN PURSUE WE DO NOT

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:43.575
HAVE TO SPEND MORE TIME TODAY

00:30:43.641 --> 00:30:45.143
BECAUSE OUR HEARING IS A LITTLE

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:48.746
DIFFERENT BUT I THINK THAT- WE-

00:30:48.813 --> 00:30:50.848
IN THE COURSE OF THE BILL THAT.

00:30:50.915 --> 00:30:52.884
THE SENATOR KERRY SENATOR RUBIO

00:30:52.951 --> 00:30:55.787
CHAIR. WE DISCOVERED WE MET

00:30:55.853 --> 00:30:58.256
WOMEN WHO EVEN AFTER SO THEY

00:30:58.323 --> 00:31:00.625
WERE IN THIS CASE IT WAS ONE WHO

00:31:00.692 --> 00:31:02.360
WAS SUBJECTED TO PHYSICAL

00:31:02.427 --> 00:31:05.597
VIOLENCE. BUT WHO THEN WAS ABLE

00:31:05.663 --> 00:31:07.232
TO HAVE HER ABUSER PROSECUTED

00:31:07.298 --> 00:31:08.032
FOR THE PHYSICAL VIOLENCE

00:31:08.099 --> 00:31:09.901
COMPLETELY REMOVED HERSELF AND

00:31:09.968 --> 00:31:12.170
HER CHILD FROM THAT. BUT THEN

00:31:12.237 --> 00:31:15.106
THAT ABUSER LATER WAS ABLE TO.

00:31:15.173 --> 00:31:18.243
WIPE OUT THIS WOMAN'S CREDIT

00:31:18.309 --> 00:31:22.013
HISTORY. AND PLANT THINGS

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:22.947
THROUGH HACKING AND SUCH THAT

00:31:23.014 --> 00:31:25.383
WERE DISPARAGING TOWARD HER

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:27.352
WHICH THEN AFFECTED HER CAREER

00:31:27.418 --> 00:31:29.220
AFFECTED HER ENTIRE PLANET I

00:31:29.287 --> 00:31:30.888
MEAN LOOK BASICALLY CREATED.

00:31:30.955 --> 00:31:35.159
LONG TERM DISASTROUS RESULTS. M.

00:31:35.226 --> 00:31:37.228
WHICH WE NEVER WERE ABLE TO BE

00:31:37.295 --> 00:31:39.197
I'M NOT ABLE TO BE BUT RATHER

00:31:39.264 --> 00:31:42.033
WERE NOT EVER PROSECUTED. SO THE

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:43.968
REPERCUSSIONS REMAIN GREATER

00:31:44.035 --> 00:31:46.404
THAN THE INITIAL CIRCUMSTANCE

00:31:46.471 --> 00:31:49.107
BUT ANYWAY IT'S A LINE OF AREA

00:31:49.173 --> 00:31:49.841
THAT WE'VE OBVIOUSLY TO PURSUE

00:31:49.907 --> 00:31:52.543
SEPARATELY. BUT ANY INFORMATION

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:53.778
WOULD BE HELPFUL AND I THINK THE

00:31:53.845 --> 00:31:58.650
EDUCATION. PROBABLY IS THE

00:31:58.716 --> 00:31:59.284
IMPORTANT PART. THE ONE THING I

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:01.953
WAS IN A SPOT THAT IS WHEN-

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:03.621
YOU'RE HAPPY WHEN I FAMILY AND

00:32:03.688 --> 00:32:07.792
THAT. SISTER AND- THE VICTIM IS

00:32:07.859 --> 00:32:08.726
TRYING TO GO THROUGH YOUR

00:32:08.793 --> 00:32:09.961
REUNIFICATION TO TRY GET HER TO

00:32:10.028 --> 00:32:12.230
BACK. WHAT YOU OFTEN SEE IS THAT

00:32:12.297 --> 00:32:14.198
BATTERIES WILL SABOTAGE THAT

00:32:14.265 --> 00:32:15.767
PROCESS FOR INSTANCE IF SHE

00:32:15.833 --> 00:32:17.035
NEEDS TO ESTABLISH INDEPENDENT

00:32:17.101 --> 00:32:19.203
HOUSING AND A JOB TO GET HER

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:20.571
KIDS BACK OR AT LEAST TO BE

00:32:20.638 --> 00:32:22.273
STABLE ENOUGH TO DO ALL THE

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:23.508
OTHER REQUIREMENTS THAT THE

00:32:23.574 --> 00:32:25.910
COURTS REQUIRING HER. IF HER

00:32:25.977 --> 00:32:27.812
CREDIT IS RUINED AND SHE GETS

00:32:27.879 --> 00:32:30.114
HER FIRED FROM THE JOB THAT CAN

00:32:30.181 --> 00:32:33.818
REALLY SABOTAGED VICTIMS-

00:32:33.885 --> 00:32:35.086
ATTEMPTS TO GET THE CHILD BACK

00:32:35.153 --> 00:32:37.455
SO IT ACTUALLY DOES COME UP

00:32:37.522 --> 00:32:41.159
INDEPENDENCY. IN MORE OFTEN THAN

00:32:41.225 --> 00:32:42.593
YOU WOULD THINK. THANK YOU SO

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:43.861

00:32:43.928 --> 00:32:45.396

RECEIVED FROM VICTIMS-

00:32:56.274 --> 00:32:58.142
CONSISTENTLY IT'S STILL A

00:32:58.209 --> 00:32:59.110
CHALLENGE TO HAVE COURTS

00:32:59.177 --> 00:33:01.412

00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:40.698
THAT'S WHY THEY FOUND BUYING

00:36:40.765 --> 00:36:43.200
THEM SO AND- IN A STORE. SO

00:36:43.267 --> 00:36:44.635
THEY'VE GONE TO ACCOUNTS OR

00:36:44.702 --> 00:36:45.469
THEY'VE GONE TO A SHELTER

00:36:45.536 --> 00:36:47.305
SEEKING HELP AND THEN A REFERRAL

00:36:47.371 --> 00:36:49.273
IS MADE. TO THE CHILD WELFARE

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:51.609
SYSTEM THOSE REFERRALS ARE THEN

00:36:51.676 --> 00:36:53.210
INVESTIGATED AND IF THEY ARE

00:36:53.277 --> 00:36:55.580
SUBSTANTIATED CASES FILED WITH

00:36:55.646 --> 00:36:56.747
ARTWORK WITH THE DEPENDENCY

00:36:56.814 --> 00:36:58.749
COURT- AND UNDER CALIFORNIA

00:36:58.816 --> 00:37:01.385
STATE LAW. THE STATE WILL THEN

00:37:01.452 --> 00:37:03.020
GET AN ATTORNEY THE PARENT HAS

00:37:03.087 --> 00:37:04.422
AN ATTORNEY AND THE CHILD HAS A

00:37:04.488 --> 00:37:06.223
RIGHT TO AN ATTORNEY AND THAT'S

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:07.258
WHAT THE CHILDREN'S LAW CENTER

00:37:07.325 --> 00:37:09.694
DOES WE REPRESENT. THE CHILD

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:10.995
ENSURING THAT THEIR VOICE IS

00:37:11.062 --> 00:37:12.797
HEARD ALSO INSURING THAT THEIR

00:37:12.863 --> 00:37:15.266
MENTAL HEALTH EDUCATIONAL NEEDS

00:37:15.333 --> 00:37:17.602
ARE BEING MET DURING THE TIME

00:37:17.668 --> 00:37:20.371
THEY FALL UNDER OUR SYSTEM- ONE

00:37:20.438 --> 00:37:21.939
OF THE ISSUES WE HAVE SEEN AS

00:37:22.006 --> 00:37:24.141
REALLY IS A LACK OF GOOD SOLID

00:37:24.208 --> 00:37:26.177
DATA. AS IT RELATES TO THE

00:37:26.243 --> 00:37:27.979
INTERSECTION OF CHILD ABUSE AND

00:37:28.045 --> 00:37:30.615
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. ON YOU

00:37:30.681 --> 00:37:32.049
BRIEFLY MENTIONED THAT THERE'S

00:37:32.116 --> 00:37:33.184
THIS WEEK HOW THE WELFARE

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:34.986
INSTITUTIONS CODE THREE HUNDRED

00:37:35.052 --> 00:37:36.220
AND EIGHTY- AND THAT IS OUR

00:37:36.287 --> 00:37:38.589
NEGLECT STATUTE. NOW WHEN HE'S

00:37:38.656 --> 00:37:40.224
COMES IN UNDER THAT STATUTE IT'S

00:37:40.291 --> 00:37:42.093
VERY BROAD IT CAN FALL UNDER

00:37:42.159 --> 00:37:43.728
GENERAL NEGLECT IT CAN BE A

00:37:43.794 --> 00:37:45.896
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE- THAT THE

00:37:45.963 --> 00:37:47.098
PARENT IS EXPERIENCING IT COULD

00:37:47.164 --> 00:37:50.434
BE SUBSTANCE ABUSE. AND FROM OUR

00:37:50.501 --> 00:37:51.302
EXPERIENCE A LARGE NUMBER OF

00:37:51.369 --> 00:37:53.170
THOSE CASES DO COME AND DUE TO

00:37:53.237 --> 00:37:55.406
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND WHEN THEY

00:37:55.473 --> 00:37:56.874
COME IN WHAT THE LAUNCH OF THE

00:37:56.941 --> 00:37:58.309
PAGE IS THAT THE SYSTEM IS GOING

00:37:58.376 --> 00:38:04.348
TO PROVIDE REGIONAL. SERVICES TO

00:38:04.415 --> 00:38:05.416
THE PARENTS. RIGHT TO PREVENT

00:38:05.483 --> 00:38:06.183
REMOVE. HOWEVER BECAUSE OF A

00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:07.318
LACK OF RESOURCE.OR JUST.

00:38:07.385 --> 00:38:08.119
BETWEEN THE CHURCH WELFARE IN

00:38:08.185 --> 00:38:09.987
THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COMMUNITY

00:38:10.054 --> 00:38:12.556
WE SEE THAT MANY OF THESE CASES

00:38:12.623 --> 00:38:13.524
LEAD TO THE CHILDREN BEING

00:38:13.591 --> 00:38:16.794
REMOVED- SO WHAT WE WANT TO TALK

00:38:16.861 --> 00:38:19.196
ABOUT IS. WHAT WE CAN HEAR A LOT

00:38:19.263 --> 00:38:21.532
TODAY IS WHAT THE SYSTEM IS

00:38:21.599 --> 00:38:23.501
DOING WRONG- AND THAT IT IS

00:38:23.567 --> 00:38:25.169
PUNITIVE TO PARENTS WHICH WE DO

00:38:25.236 --> 00:38:27.505
NOT DISAGREE WITH. OUR WE LIKE

00:38:27.571 --> 00:38:29.206
TO FIRST ESTABLISH THAT THERE

00:38:29.273 --> 00:38:32.176
CAN BE AN ONGOING REST. TO A

00:38:32.243 --> 00:38:33.010
CHILD IN A HOME WITH DOMESTIC

00:38:33.077 --> 00:38:34.979
VIOLENCE. SO WE'VE SEEN THERE

00:38:35.046 --> 00:38:36.514
ARE STUDIES THE IMPACT OF

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:38.082
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ON CHILDREN.

00:38:38.149 --> 00:38:39.617
THERE'S POTENTIAL RISKS THE

00:38:39.684 --> 00:38:41.919
PHYSICAL REST. STUDY SHOWING

00:38:41.986 --> 00:38:43.721
HOMES WHERE VIOLENCE BETWEEN

00:38:43.788 --> 00:38:45.389
PARENTS A CURSE PARTNERS FIRST.

00:38:45.456 --> 00:38:47.124
CHART INCREASED RISK OF BEING

00:38:47.191 --> 00:38:49.894
ABUSE. THEY ALSO CAN EXPERIENCE

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:51.128
PHYSICAL HEALTH PROBLEMS

00:38:51.195 --> 00:38:54.265
INCLUDING GENERALIZED ANXIETY.

00:38:54.331 --> 00:38:56.701
SLEEPLESSNESS NIGHTMARES

00:38:56.767 --> 00:38:59.003
DIFFICULTY CONCENTRATING. HIGH

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:01.105
ACTIVITY LEVELS INCREASED

00:39:01.172 --> 00:39:03.741
AGGRESSION- INCREASED ANXIETY

00:39:03.808 --> 00:39:05.109
ABOUT BEING SEPARATED FROM A

00:39:05.176 --> 00:39:07.078
PARENT OR EVEN INTENSE WORRY

00:39:07.144 --> 00:39:09.313
ABOUT THEIR SAFETY OR THE SAFETY

00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:09.880
OF THE PARENT THAT IS BEING

00:39:09.947 --> 00:39:12.450
ABUSED- WE'VE ALSO SEEN THAT

00:39:12.516 --> 00:39:14.719
THERE CAN BE. LONG TERM PHYSICAL

00:39:14.785 --> 00:39:17.254
HEALTH PROBLEMS- AND THEN

00:39:17.321 --> 00:39:19.056
BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS THAT DEVELOP

00:39:19.123 --> 00:39:21.525
INTO ADOLESCENCE. AND STUDIES

00:39:21.592 --> 00:39:23.527
HAVE SHOWN THAT CHILDREN THAT

00:39:23.594 --> 00:39:24.061
HAVE EXPERIENCED DOMESTIC

00:39:24.128 --> 00:39:26.397
VIOLENCE IN THE HOME- CAN HAVE A

00:39:26.464 --> 00:39:27.832
HIGHER INCIDENCE OF DELINQUENCY

00:39:27.898 --> 00:39:30.601
INVOLVEMENT THEY CAN BE 75274%

00:39:30.668 --> 00:39:33.137
MORE LIKELY. TO COMMIT A VIOLENT

00:39:33.204 --> 00:39:36.607
CRIME- 50% MORE LIKELY TO ABUSE

00:39:36.674 --> 00:39:38.876
DRUGS OR ALCOHOL. TWO TIMES MORE

00:39:38.943 --> 00:39:40.911
LIKELY TO REPEAT THE CYCLE OF

00:39:40.978 --> 00:39:43.180
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE- AND I THINK

00:39:43.247 --> 00:39:44.381
IT'S TIME YEAH MENTION THEIR

00:39:44.448 --> 00:39:46.150
ORGANIZATION AND THEIR GOAL IS

00:39:46.217 --> 00:39:47.485
TO STOP THE INTERGENERATIONAL

00:39:47.551 --> 00:39:50.621
CYCLE OF VIOLENCE SO. WE DO SEE

00:39:50.688 --> 00:39:52.256
A GREAT CONCERN FOR CHILDREN

00:39:52.323 --> 00:39:54.058
THAT ARE- WITNESSING DOMESTIC

00:39:54.125 --> 00:39:55.659
VIOLENCE IF THEY ARE LIKELY TO

00:39:55.726 --> 00:39:57.862
REPEAT THAT CYCLE. THEY ALSO CAN

00:39:57.928 --> 00:39:58.696
EXPERIENCE EMOTIONAL

00:39:58.763 --> 00:40:03.868
DIFFICULTIES. IN ADULTHOOD WE'VE

00:40:03.934 --> 00:40:04.502
SEEN AN INCREASE IN OPPRESSION

00:40:04.568 --> 00:40:05.469
ANXIETY DISORDER AND POST STRESS

00:40:05.536 --> 00:40:08.139
DISORDER. SO CLEARLY THERE ARE

00:40:08.205 --> 00:40:09.673
UNDOUBTEDLY SITUATIONS OR

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:12.009
INNOVATE INTERVENTION IS NEEDED

00:40:12.076 --> 00:40:15.246
GIVEN ALL THESE INCREASED RISKS.

00:40:15.312 --> 00:40:17.014
HOWEVER WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THE

00:40:17.081 --> 00:40:19.283
SYSTEM RESPONSE CURRENTLY IS

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:21.685
HUGELY DETRIMENTAL TO FAMILIES-

00:40:21.752 --> 00:40:23.754
THERE'S SORT OF A ONE SIZE FITS

00:40:23.821 --> 00:40:25.189
ALL AND I BELIEVE THE PANEL

00:40:25.256 --> 00:40:26.557
ITSELF TO ME BRIAN'S GOING TO

00:40:26.624 --> 00:40:31.028
ADDRESS THAT MORE. BITE- REALLY

00:40:31.095 --> 00:40:32.730
IN THE SYSTEM BY WHICH CAN BE

00:40:32.797 --> 00:40:34.732
CAUSED BY A RANGE OF ISSUES AND

00:40:34.799 --> 00:40:36.367
WHAT I MEAN- YOU KNOW FOCUSED ON

00:40:36.433 --> 00:40:37.868
THE POWER CONTROL OF DOMESTIC

00:40:37.935 --> 00:40:39.236
VIOLENCE AND THAT IS SOMETHING

00:40:39.303 --> 00:40:41.605
THAT WE DO SEE WE ALSO SEE

00:40:41.672 --> 00:40:44.141
FAMILIES- THAT ARE EXPERIENCING

00:40:44.208 --> 00:40:46.977
POVERTY. OR HOMELESSNESS OR

00:40:47.044 --> 00:40:50.047
SUBSTANCE ABUSE OR MENTAL HEALTH

00:40:50.114 --> 00:40:51.749
AND INSTEAD OF ADDRESSING THOSE

00:40:51.816 --> 00:40:54.351
ISSUES IT'S SORT OF A ONE SIZE

00:40:54.418 --> 00:40:56.287
FITS ALL REMOVE THE CHILD FROM

00:40:56.353 --> 00:40:58.956
THE HARM. AND NOT GIVING THE

00:40:59.023 --> 00:41:01.192
FAMILY THE SUPPORT NEEDED TO

00:41:01.258 --> 00:41:03.294
EITHER ADDRESS THEIR UNDERLYING

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:05.229
PROBLEMS WHETHER THAT BE SUPPORT

00:41:05.296 --> 00:41:07.965
WITH HOUSING OR MENTAL HEALTH OR

00:41:08.032 --> 00:41:09.333
GETTING THEM INTO IT- SUBSTANCE

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:11.035
ABUSE TREATMENT PROGRAM OR

00:41:11.101 --> 00:41:12.903
ADDRESSING UNDERLYING TRAUMA AND

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:15.739
RELATIONSHIP ISSUES- SO THESE

00:41:15.806 --> 00:41:17.007
INTERTWINED ISSUES OF

00:41:17.074 --> 00:41:19.009
HOMELESSNESS AND POVERTY. REALLY

00:41:19.076 --> 00:41:21.478
PAT GREAT PART AND A LOT OF THE

00:41:21.545 --> 00:41:23.247
CASES THAT WE SEE COME BEFORE-

00:41:23.314 --> 00:41:28.185
OUR COURTS- AND I THINK THAT'S

00:41:28.252 --> 00:41:29.720
ONE THING THAT WE WANTED TO

00:41:29.787 --> 00:41:31.222
FOCUS ON IS THE MANY THE MYRIAD

00:41:31.288 --> 00:41:33.123
OF REASONS. THAT A DOMESTIC

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:35.159
VIOLENCE CASE COULD COME IN AND

00:41:35.226 --> 00:41:37.161
HOW RIGHT NOW THE SUPPORTS ARE

00:41:37.228 --> 00:41:40.331
NOT BEING PROVIDED- WHAT SHOULD

00:41:40.397 --> 00:41:42.266
HAPPEN AS I MENTIONED THERE'S A

00:41:42.333 --> 00:41:44.568
REASONABLE SERVICE REQUIREMENT-

00:41:44.635 --> 00:41:46.570
THE LAW REQUIRES THAT BEFORE

00:41:46.637 --> 00:41:48.539
FAMILY IS SEPARATED. THEY SHOULD

00:41:48.606 --> 00:41:50.007
BE PROVIDED SERVICES TO

00:41:50.074 --> 00:41:53.811
ELIMINATE THE RISK- OFTENTIMES

00:41:53.878 --> 00:41:55.913
THERE ARE GREAT BARRIER SO WHEN

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:58.182
A- VICTIM IS BEING TOLD THAT

00:41:58.249 --> 00:41:59.116
THEY'RE FAILING TO PROTECT

00:41:59.183 --> 00:42:00.651
BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT REMOVED

00:42:00.718 --> 00:42:02.686
HIMSELF FROM THE SITUATION. BUT

00:42:02.753 --> 00:42:04.722
AS WE KNOW HOUSING CAN BE A HUGE

00:42:04.788 --> 00:42:07.791
BARRIER I'M TELLING- EVERYONE IN

00:42:07.858 --> 00:42:09.927
CHILE AS WELL AS- BABY ALL

00:42:09.994 --> 00:42:11.328
THAT'S AVAILABLE IS A SHELTER

00:42:11.395 --> 00:42:12.897
THEY CAN ONLY KEEP OUR HER

00:42:12.963 --> 00:42:14.899
CHILDREN THERE FOR A FEW WEEKS.

00:42:14.965 --> 00:42:16.567
OR ARE THERE SOME FINANCIAL

00:42:16.634 --> 00:42:19.370
BARRIERS AND WHERE THE JOB IS-

00:42:19.436 --> 00:42:21.171
LANGUAGE BARRIERS WE SEE WE SEE

00:42:21.238 --> 00:42:24.041
IMMIGRATION BARRIERS. AND THE

00:42:24.108 --> 00:42:25.976
CURRENT PROCESS REALLY TAKES

00:42:26.043 --> 00:42:29.280
AWAY THE VICTIM'S POWER- THEY'RE

00:42:29.346 --> 00:42:31.448
EXTREMELY PRESCRIPTIVE PLANS

00:42:31.515 --> 00:42:33.284
THAT IT'S LIKE A GUY IN THIS ONE

00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:35.719
SIZE FITS ALL. THAT THIS IS

00:42:35.786 --> 00:42:37.187
WHAT'S HAPPENING OKAY YOU NEED

00:42:37.254 --> 00:42:39.323
TO IMMEDIATELY LEAVE THE ABUSER

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:41.091
LEAVE EVERYTHING THAT YOU'LL NOW

00:42:41.158 --> 00:42:43.193
WITHOUT REALLY ADDRESSING WHAT

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:45.195
THEIR NEEDS ARE AND WHAT SUPPORT

00:42:45.262 --> 00:42:47.498
CAN BE GIVEN TO THEM- ONE

00:42:47.564 --> 00:42:48.933
EXAMPLE WE OFTEN ENCOUNTER IN

00:42:48.999 --> 00:42:51.235
OUR- PRACTICE HERE BECAUSE WE DO

00:42:51.302 --> 00:42:53.570
REPRESENT- YOUTH WERE ALSO

00:42:53.637 --> 00:42:55.973
PARENTS THEMSELVES SO. SOME OF

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:58.575
OUR OLDER TEENAGE CLIENTS. ARE

00:42:58.642 --> 00:43:01.445
THEMSELVES PARENTING AND THEY DO

00:43:01.512 --> 00:43:03.180
FIND THEMSELVES IN RELATIONSHIPS

00:43:03.247 --> 00:43:05.082
OR VIOLENCE IS AN ISSUE BUT

00:43:05.149 --> 00:43:06.283
INSTEAD OF TEACHING THEM ABOUT

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:08.552
HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS OR

00:43:08.619 --> 00:43:10.821
DRESSING THEIR OWN TRAUMA. AGAIN

00:43:10.888 --> 00:43:12.356
WE GO TO THAT ONE SIZE FITS ALL

00:43:12.423 --> 00:43:13.891
SOLUTION WHICH IS TO REMOVE

00:43:13.958 --> 00:43:16.193
THEIR CHILDREN. BUT THAT'S NOT A

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:18.262
DRESSING FOR THE SUPPORTS THEY

00:43:18.329 --> 00:43:20.064
NEED THE DEVELOPMENT OF HEALTHY

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:21.532
RESPECTFUL NONVIOLENT

00:43:21.598 --> 00:43:23.434
RELATIONSHIPS. TEACHING

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:25.102
TEENAGERS HOW TO MAINTAIN A

00:43:25.169 --> 00:43:26.303
HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP AND

00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:28.572
DEVELOPING SKILLS ABOUT MANAGING

00:43:28.639 --> 00:43:30.107
THEIR FEELINGS ARE COMMUNICATING

00:43:30.174 --> 00:43:32.209
IN A HEALTHY WAY. YOU KNOW

00:43:32.276 --> 00:43:35.179
FOCUSING ON PREVENTION MEASURES-

00:43:35.245 --> 00:43:37.214
LIKE HAVING SUPPORT SYSTEM FROM

00:43:37.281 --> 00:43:39.850
THEIR PEERS AND THEIR FAMILIES-

00:43:39.917 --> 00:43:41.752
AND REALLY AGAIN JUST NOT

00:43:41.819 --> 00:43:45.756
LOOKING. TOO WHAT THEY ARE-

00:43:45.823 --> 00:43:47.658
VICTIM NEEDS WHAT A FAMILY

00:43:47.725 --> 00:43:55.299
MEANS- AND AGAIN LOOKING. AT SO

00:43:55.366 --> 00:43:57.101
WHERE ARE THE- AREAS WE CAN. AND

00:43:57.167 --> 00:43:57.634
WE DO FEEL THAT ONE OF THE

00:43:57.701 --> 00:43:59.503
REASONS ONE A DRY- THIS ISSUE AS

00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:00.971
WELL AS WE CAN BE AS A LACK OF

00:44:01.038 --> 00:44:02.139
TRAINING AND KNOWLEDGE ON

00:44:02.206 --> 00:44:05.209
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE- FOR THE CHILD

00:44:05.275 --> 00:44:07.211
WELFARE SYSTEM- RECOGNIZING

00:44:07.277 --> 00:44:09.947
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE- AGAIN OUR

00:44:10.014 --> 00:44:10.981
FIRST PRESENTER ON YEAH YOU KNOW

00:44:11.048 --> 00:44:12.516
TALKED ABOUT THE DIFFERENT.

00:44:12.583 --> 00:44:14.385
TYPES AND THAT MANY PEOPLE

00:44:14.451 --> 00:44:15.686
IMMEDIATELY GO TO PHYSICAL

00:44:15.753 --> 00:44:18.022
VIOLENCE- NOT UNDERSTAND THAT

00:44:18.088 --> 00:44:20.124
THERE CAN BE FINANCIAL OR

00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:23.594
EMOTIONAL OR- AS THE BELL CENTRE

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:24.928
REVIEW PART FOR THE COURSE OF

00:44:24.995 --> 00:44:27.498
CONTROL ISSUES. SO WE'RE FAILING

00:44:27.564 --> 00:44:29.566
TO EVEN RECOGNIZE THE TYPES OF

00:44:29.633 --> 00:44:31.402
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THE DIFFERENT

00:44:31.468 --> 00:44:33.937
FORMS OF IT HOW CAN WE BE SURE

00:44:34.004 --> 00:44:35.339
THAT WE'RE PROVIDING THE-

00:44:35.406 --> 00:44:37.141
CORRECT RESOURCES THAT WE EVEN

00:44:37.207 --> 00:44:38.776
ARE AWARE OF WHAT RESOURCES

00:44:38.842 --> 00:44:41.612
EXIST- AND THEN HOW TO MAKE AN

00:44:41.678 --> 00:44:43.981
INDIVIDUALIZED ASSESSMENT. OF

00:44:44.048 --> 00:44:45.282
WHAT FAMILIES NEED TO MOVE

00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:48.419
FORWARD- AND THIS TRAINING AND

00:44:48.485 --> 00:44:49.853
KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:52.556
NEEDS TO BE BY THE ENTIRE SYSTEM

00:44:52.623 --> 00:44:54.358
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ATTORNEYS-

00:44:54.425 --> 00:44:56.260
SOCIAL WORKERS AND OUR JUDICIAL

00:44:56.326 --> 00:45:00.197
OFFICERS- ONE AREA WHERE. THE

00:45:00.264 --> 00:45:01.065
CHILDREN'S LAW CENTER IS

00:45:01.131 --> 00:45:04.068
BEGINNING TO FOCUS IS TURNING

00:45:04.134 --> 00:45:07.137
BRAIN INJURY- WE'RE LEARNING-

00:45:07.204 --> 00:45:08.705
THAT MANY VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC

00:45:08.772 --> 00:45:10.307
VIOLENCE HAVE ENCOURAGED MATIC

00:45:10.374 --> 00:45:12.142
BRAIN INJURIES. WHICH CAN HAVE A

00:45:12.209 --> 00:45:14.078
PHYSIOLOGICAL FACTS FOR SOME

00:45:14.144 --> 00:45:16.213
PERIOD AFTER THAT INJURY- AND

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:18.315
INSTEAD OF RECOGNIZING SIGNS OF

00:45:18.382 --> 00:45:20.284
THIS TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY- AS

00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:21.852
I MEAN I HAD MENTIONED IT

00:45:21.919 --> 00:45:23.987
IMPACTS HOW WE LOOK AT A VICTIM.

00:45:24.054 --> 00:45:25.122
WE LOOK AT THE WAY THAT THE

00:45:25.189 --> 00:45:27.491
PRESIDING AND THAT THEY ARE

00:45:27.558 --> 00:45:29.493
UNINVOLVED IN DON'T CARE ABOUT

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:31.428
THE CHILD IF THERE'S AN APATHY

00:45:31.495 --> 00:45:33.197
OR AN UNWILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE IN

00:45:33.263 --> 00:45:35.632
SERVICES WHEN THERE MAY BE THE

00:45:35.699 --> 00:45:37.901
UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION-

00:45:37.968 --> 00:45:39.470
AND THE PHYSICAL IMPACT OF A

00:45:39.536 --> 00:45:41.205
TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND HOW

00:45:41.271 --> 00:45:43.640
IT MIGHT MANIFEST. AS A FAILURE

00:45:43.707 --> 00:45:45.943
TO COMPLY OR WHAT WE'VE HEARD

00:45:46.009 --> 00:45:48.378
ABOUT THE FAILURE TO PROTECT-

00:45:48.445 --> 00:45:49.847
WE'RE STARTING A PILOT ACTUALLY

00:45:49.913 --> 00:45:55.152

VIOLENCE- OUR CHALLENGE IS GOING

00:46:07.231 --> 00:46:08.765
TO BE TOGETHER RESOURCES AND

00:46:08.832 --> 00:46:10.667
PROVIDERS TO FURTHER SUPPORT

00:46:10.734 --> 00:46:12.369

CLIENTS AND COURTS. AND COUNSEL-

00:46:16.273 --> 00:46:19.776
WITH THE GOAL TO BE TO. THREE

INDIVIDUALIZE QUE CLASE PANTS

00:46:21.745 --> 00:46:23.080
ARE MORE ALIGNED WITH BRAIN

00:46:23.147 --> 00:46:26.183
TRAUMA- IN HOPES OF IMPROVING

00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:29.019
OUTCOMES- THIS GOES BACK TO THE

00:46:29.086 --> 00:46:30.287
FURTHER INSTEAD OF LIKE

00:46:30.354 --> 00:46:33.056
PROVIDING TRUE PREVENTION

00:46:33.123 --> 00:46:35.025
INTERVENTION SERVICES. OFTEN THE

00:46:35.092 --> 00:46:36.760
RESPONSE WE SEE AS TRUMP THE

00:46:36.827 --> 00:46:38.128
CHILDREN AND PLACE THEM INTO

00:46:38.195 --> 00:46:40.697
FOSTER CARE SO WHILE I DISCUSSED

00:46:40.764 --> 00:46:42.499
PREVIOUSLY THAT HARM THAT CAN

00:46:42.566 --> 00:46:45.302
COME TO THE CHILDREN BY BEING AT

00:46:45.369 --> 00:46:46.904
HOME WITH THE MYSTIC VIOLENCE I

00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:48.005
WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

00:46:48.071 --> 00:46:49.973
THE HARM TO THE FAMILY AND TO

00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:51.808
THE CHILD. FROM CHILD WELFARE

00:46:51.875 --> 00:46:53.443
INTERVENTION YOU KNOW IN THIS IS

00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:55.045
THAT SYSTEM THAT'S COMING INTO

00:46:55.112 --> 00:46:58.949
CONTACT- SO. WE'LL HEAR MORE

00:46:59.016 --> 00:47:02.386
FROM OTHER ADVOCATES. BUT THE

00:47:02.452 --> 00:47:04.788
HARM TO THE FAMILY. IS THE

00:47:04.855 --> 00:47:06.857
VICTIM BEING PUNISHED AND I

00:47:06.924 --> 00:47:08.859
BELIEVE I CAN COVER THAT A LOT

00:47:08.926 --> 00:47:10.427
BY WHEN THEY'RE REACHING OUT FOR

00:47:10.494 --> 00:47:11.595
HELP AND THEN THEY FIND

00:47:11.662 --> 00:47:12.596
THEMSELVES IN THE CHILD WELFARE

00:47:12.663 --> 00:47:14.731
SYSTEM BEING PUNISHED FOR

00:47:14.798 --> 00:47:18.202
SEEKING HELP. ARMED SERVICES CAN

00:47:18.268 --> 00:47:19.970
BE EXTREMELY OVERWHELMING AND

00:47:20.037 --> 00:47:22.573
THEY ARE NOT PAID FOR SO WE SET

00:47:22.639 --> 00:47:25.108
UP THESE PROGRAMS FOR FAMILIES

00:47:25.175 --> 00:47:27.044
TO PARTICIPATE AND WHETHER THAT

00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:28.478
BE. A BATTERER'S INTERVENTION

00:47:28.545 --> 00:47:31.582
PROGRAM OR PARENTING OR-

00:47:31.648 --> 00:47:33.617
COUNSELING- GETTING TO THOSE

00:47:33.684 --> 00:47:35.686
SERVICES CAN BE DIFFICULT AND

00:47:35.752 --> 00:47:37.387
THERE ARE YOU KNOW A FINANCIAL

00:47:37.454 --> 00:47:38.488
BURDEN TO THESE FAMILIES WHO ARE

00:47:38.555 --> 00:47:40.924
EXPERIENCING. THE LOSS OF THAT

00:47:40.991 --> 00:47:42.359
HAD TO ME ABOUT THE LOSS OF SOME

00:47:42.426 --> 00:47:45.195
FINANCIAL SUPPORT- THE FAMILY

00:47:45.262 --> 00:47:46.897
CAN SOMETIMES LOSE BENEFITS WHEN

00:47:46.964 --> 00:47:48.999
THEIR CHILDREN ARE REMOVED. AND

00:47:49.066 --> 00:47:50.234
I GUESS I SAID TRYING TO KEEP UP

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:51.635
WITH ALL THE COURT MANDATED

00:47:51.702 --> 00:47:54.104
PROGRAMS- AND THEN ANOTHER ONE

00:47:54.171 --> 00:47:55.205
WITH TAT WE SEE AND I DON'T

00:47:55.272 --> 00:47:56.940
BELIEVE IT'S BEEN TOUCHED UPON.

00:47:57.007 --> 00:47:58.775
BUT WE OFTENTIMES PENALIZE

00:47:58.842 --> 00:48:00.143
FAMILIES IF THERE'S ANY

00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:01.411
EXPRESSED INTENT TO REMAIN

00:48:01.478 --> 00:48:04.681
TOGETHER AS A FAMILY- AND THERE

00:48:04.748 --> 00:48:07.551
ARE SITUATIONS WHERE IF SERVICES

00:48:07.618 --> 00:48:08.619
AND SUPPORTS ARE PUT IN PLACE

00:48:08.685 --> 00:48:10.320
THIS MAY BE WHAT IS BEST FOR

00:48:10.387 --> 00:48:11.722
THAT FAMILY AND ASKING THAT%

00:48:11.788 --> 00:48:13.323
FAMILY WHAT THEY NEED. SO THE

00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:15.058
ASSUMPTION IS VICTIM SHOULD

00:48:15.125 --> 00:48:16.627
IMMEDIATELY LEAVE THE ABUSER OR

00:48:16.693 --> 00:48:18.362
THERE IS A FAILURE TO BE TAXED

00:48:18.428 --> 00:48:19.162
WHERE THEN THERE MIGHT BE AN

00:48:19.229 --> 00:48:24.935
INDIVIDUAL LYSED WAY. TO BETTER

00:48:25.002 --> 00:48:26.136
SUPPORT THE FAMILY. AND SHE'S.

00:48:26.203 --> 00:48:27.638
THEN THE HARM TO CHILL. WHEN THE

00:48:27.704 --> 00:48:28.672
INTERVENTION OF THE CHILD

00:48:28.739 --> 00:48:29.806
WELFARE SYSTEM COMES IN AND

00:48:29.873 --> 00:48:31.575
WHERE WE JUST COME IN AND REMOVE

00:48:31.642 --> 00:48:33.710
THE CHILD- THAT'S THE TRAUMA

00:48:33.777 --> 00:48:38.181
FROM SEPARATION- YOU KNOW IT'S-

00:48:38.248 --> 00:48:40.384
WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE HARM. TO

00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:42.252
CHILDREN IN A HOME WITH DOMESTIC

00:48:42.319 --> 00:48:43.820
VIOLENCE BUT IT'S REALLY

00:48:43.887 --> 00:48:44.855
IMPORTANT TO ALSO ADDRESS THE

00:48:44.921 --> 00:48:47.157
HOME TO BEING REMOVED AND PLACED

00:48:47.224 --> 00:48:48.492
IN FOSTER CARE AND THIS

00:48:48.558 --> 00:48:50.594
SHOULDN'T BE A DEBATE ABOUT WHAT

00:48:50.661 --> 00:48:52.796
IS WORSE WE DON'T WANT TO DO A

00:48:52.863 --> 00:48:54.665
BALANCE OF HARMS AND THAT WAY.

00:48:54.731 --> 00:48:56.199
WE SHOULD BE WORKING OUT HOW WE

00:48:56.266 --> 00:48:59.970
CAN FIX THAT- CELL LOOKING AT

00:49:00.037 --> 00:49:02.105
WHAT HAPPENS TO THESE FAMILIES

00:49:02.172 --> 00:49:04.007
AND HOW CAN WE BETTER SUPPORT

00:49:04.074 --> 00:49:07.144
THEM- BY PROVIDING PROTECTION TO

00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:10.714
THE CHILD AND TO- THE VICTIM.

00:49:10.781 --> 00:49:11.882
BUT ALSO ENSURING THAT THE

00:49:11.948 --> 00:49:13.483
SUPPORTS THAT ARE NEEDED ARE

00:49:13.550 --> 00:49:15.552
PROVIDED TO THEM- I BELIEVE I'M

INVESTIGATIONS AND WE BRING

00:51:33.690 --> 00:51:37.194
THAT- THAT VOICE TO THE COURT

00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:39.429
ARMAMENT. OBVIOUSLY DEPENDING ON

00:51:39.496 --> 00:51:44.401
THE CHILD'S AGE THAT BERRIES- WE

00:51:44.468 --> 00:51:46.269
DO HAVE TO- BUT GETTING TOO

00:51:46.336 --> 00:51:47.471
TECHNICAL MINORS COUNCIL IN

00:51:47.537 --> 00:51:49.272
CALIFORNIA HOLD A DUAL ROLE

00:51:49.339 --> 00:51:50.941
WHERE WE LOOK AT THE CHILD'S

00:51:51.007 --> 00:51:52.409
BEST INTEREST AS WELL AS THEIR

00:51:52.476 --> 00:51:54.544
STATED INTERESTS- AND I CAN

00:51:54.611 --> 00:51:56.980
DEPEND ON. YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY ON

00:51:57.047 --> 00:51:58.315
THE AGE OF THE CHILD SO WE ARE

00:51:58.381 --> 00:51:59.749
THERE IS ALWAYS A CHILD BECAUSE

00:51:59.816 --> 00:52:01.618
AS OBVIOUSLY A GREAT RESOURCE

00:52:01.685 --> 00:52:05.055
AND CAN BE ASSIGNED- BY CASE BY

00:52:05.121 --> 00:52:07.390
CASE BASIS SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE

00:52:07.457 --> 00:52:10.627
ANOTHER. OUTLET BUT WE ARE THAT

00:52:10.694 --> 00:52:12.128
WAYS WE DO THE INDEPENDENT

00:52:12.195 --> 00:52:13.964
RELATIONS I THINK THE SOLUTIONS

00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:15.732
THAT WE'RE SORT OF LOOKING AT

00:52:15.799 --> 00:52:17.367
AND WARS I TRANSPIRED FIRST

00:52:17.434 --> 00:52:19.936
PANELIST- IS IN THE FAILURE TO

00:52:20.003 --> 00:52:23.039
PROTECT AROUND- AND JUST MORE SO

00:52:23.106 --> 00:52:25.208
JUST NOT HAVING THIS ONE SIZE

00:52:25.275 --> 00:52:28.478
FITS ALL. THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT

00:52:28.545 --> 00:52:30.380
THE FAMILY AND WHAT THEY NEED

00:52:30.447 --> 00:52:31.915
AND THAT WHEN SOMEONE REACHES

00:52:31.982 --> 00:52:33.950
OUT FOR HELP THAT THERE IS NOT A

00:52:34.017 --> 00:52:35.519
PUNITIVE THE FACT THAT WE ARE.

00:52:35.585 --> 00:52:37.320
REALLY COMING TOGETHER TO

00:52:37.387 --> 00:52:41.057
SUPPORT- AND I THINK JUST THE

00:52:41.124 --> 00:52:42.192
WAY THAT THE CURRENT O'CLOCK

00:52:42.259 --> 00:52:44.027
STATUTE AS WRITTEN AND SORT OF

00:52:44.094 --> 00:52:46.830
HOW IT'S IMPLEMENTED MARCEL-

00:52:46.897 --> 00:52:49.933
THOSE SUPPORTS. ARE ALWAYS PUT

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:54.771
IN PLACE. AND- I WAS AT THE

00:52:54.838 --> 00:52:56.706
FOREFRONT WE ANT TO PROTECT

00:52:56.773 --> 00:52:58.909
CHILDREN FROM HARM- WE WANT TO

00:52:58.975 --> 00:53:02.045
PROTECT FAMILIES- BUT SOMETIMES

00:53:02.112 --> 00:53:03.146
WHEN YOU GO TO YOUR IMMEDIATE

00:53:03.213 --> 00:53:04.447
REACTION IS JUST REMOVE AND

00:53:04.514 --> 00:53:06.983
SEPARATE- WITHOUT TAKING INTO

00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:08.618
ACCOUNT THE ADDITIONAL TRAUMA

00:53:08.685 --> 00:53:11.388
THAT IS BEING PUT ON THAT CHILD.

00:53:11.454 --> 00:53:15.025
FROM THAT SEPARATION. GOT IT I

00:53:15.091 --> 00:53:19.262
GUESS MY CONCERN IS- THAT NOT

00:53:19.329 --> 00:53:21.131
EVERY FAMILY ENTERS THE COURT

00:53:21.197 --> 00:53:25.402
SYSTEM IN THE SAME WAY. AND- I

00:53:25.468 --> 00:53:30.006
HAVEN'T PRACTICED LAW. FOR A FEW

00:53:30.073 --> 00:53:34.044
YEARS NOW- BUT WHEN I DID WHEN I

00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:35.579
HAD MY LOT MY OWN LAW PRACTICE

00:53:35.645 --> 00:53:37.781
SITE I TOOK THREE HUNDRED AND

00:53:37.847 --> 00:53:38.281
SIX HUNDRED CASES COURT

00:53:38.348 --> 00:53:40.183
APPOINTED AND REPRESENTED

00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:43.019
PARENTS AND- CHILDREN DEPENDING

00:53:43.086 --> 00:53:45.221
ON. THE LANGUAGE ABILITY OF THE

00:53:45.288 --> 00:53:47.624
PARENTS- MANY TIMES I WAS

00:53:47.691 --> 00:53:49.259
APPOINTED TO BECAUSE I SPOKE

00:53:49.326 --> 00:53:52.228
SPANISH BUT- BUT MY REAL CONCERN

00:53:52.295 --> 00:53:57.467
IS THAT- IS IT WHEN YOU. WHEN

00:53:57.534 --> 00:53:58.602
YOUR COURT APPOINTED IT'S

00:53:58.668 --> 00:54:00.136
USUALLY BECAUSE A CHILD IS

00:54:00.203 --> 00:54:01.805
ALREADY GOING TO BE REMOVED FROM

00:54:01.871 --> 00:54:04.174
THE HOME AND THE ONES THAT WE

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:05.675
DID THAT I DIDN'T GET COURT

00:54:05.742 --> 00:54:06.943
APPOINTED ON WERE THE ONES THAT

00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:08.812
WENT THROUGH THE DAY THE-

00:54:08.878 --> 00:54:11.014
DVORCE OR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

00:54:11.081 --> 00:54:13.083
SYSTEM THAT THEY DIDN'T END UP

00:54:13.149 --> 00:54:14.851
AS PART OF A THREE HUNDRED OR

00:54:14.918 --> 00:54:17.420
SIX HUNDRED CASES AND SO- AND

00:54:17.487 --> 00:54:21.224
KNOWS CHECK CHILDREN- MANY TIMES

00:54:21.291 --> 00:54:23.259
WERE NOT REPRESENTED IN COURT-

00:54:23.326 --> 00:54:25.495
IT WAS THE PARENTS FIGHTING

00:54:25.562 --> 00:54:30.300
FIGHTING IT OUT OR THE- OR- OR-

00:54:30.367 --> 00:54:37.374
THE VICTIM- IF THERE WAS NEVER A

00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:39.042
DIVORCE PROCEEDING OR CUSTODY

00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:41.177
PROCEEDING THAT KID'S- WISHES

00:54:41.244 --> 00:54:44.114
WERE NEVER. REALLY TAKEN INTO

00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:45.515
ACCOUNT AND I GUESS I'M JUST THE

00:54:45.582 --> 00:54:47.884
SYSTEM IS A COMPLICATED SYSTEM

00:54:47.951 --> 00:54:48.485
DEPENDING ON HOW YOU INTERPRET

00:54:48.551 --> 00:54:50.620
AND I'M- AND THE MORE

00:54:50.687 --> 00:54:52.255
FLEXIBILITY WE GIVE TO JUDGES

00:54:52.322 --> 00:54:54.858
THE MORE DIFFERENCE IN TREATMENT

00:54:54.924 --> 00:54:57.627
YOU SEE- AND SO WE'RE WE'RE IN

00:54:57.694 --> 00:55:00.397
A- I GUESS WORK I THINK OUR

00:55:00.463 --> 00:55:02.365
INTEREST IS MAKING SURE THAT-

00:55:02.432 --> 00:55:03.566
WE'RE PROTECTING THE INTERESTS

00:55:03.633 --> 00:55:05.335
OF THE CHILD AND THE VICTIMS.

00:55:05.402 --> 00:55:07.704
AND THAT THERE'S A SYSTEM IN

00:55:07.771 --> 00:55:09.439
PLACE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THEM

00:55:09.506 --> 00:55:11.408
. WITH THE SUPPORTS THAT THEY

00:55:11.474 --> 00:55:13.109
NEED AND I DIDN'T ALWAYS SEE

00:55:13.176 --> 00:55:14.310
THAT IN THE COURT I GUESS THAT'S

00:55:14.377 --> 00:55:18.081
MY BIGGEST CONCERN- YES. YEAH

00:55:18.148 --> 00:55:19.382
AND I'VE I CAN BRIEFLY ADDRESSED

00:55:19.449 --> 00:55:20.850
THAT I WORKED IN THE I WAS A

00:55:20.917 --> 00:55:22.652
FAMILY LAW ATTORNEY- AND THAT

00:55:22.719 --> 00:55:27.223
WAS

00:55:27.290 --> 00:55:29.192
KNOW HAVE A VOICE EXCEPT IN VERY

00:55:29.259 --> 00:55:31.361
LIMITED SITUATIONS WHERE. MINORS

00:55:31.428 --> 00:55:33.997
COUNCIL WAS APPOINTED- BUT THAT

00:55:34.064 --> 00:55:36.466
WAS A RARE- AND IT IS ONE OF THE

00:55:36.533 --> 00:55:38.034
REASONS I AM. AN ORGANIZATION

00:55:38.101 --> 00:55:40.570
WHERE EVERY CHILD HAS A VOICE-

00:55:40.637 --> 00:55:42.872
BUT I THINK ONE THING AND I

00:55:42.939 --> 00:55:44.007
DON'T KNOW THAT WE TOUCHED ON

00:55:44.074 --> 00:55:47.377
IT- BUT IS. IN THE BEGINNING IS

00:55:47.444 --> 00:55:49.345
SORT OF THE PREVENTION SERVICES.

00:55:49.412 --> 00:55:53.116
IS WORKING WITH SYSTEMS THAT

00:55:53.183 --> 00:55:53.717
COME INTO CONTACT WITH THESE

00:55:53.783 --> 00:55:56.453
FAMILIES- TO PREVENT THIS SORT

00:55:56.519 --> 00:55:58.888
OF THE FILINGS OF THESE CASES IN

00:55:58.955 --> 00:56:00.223
CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM WORKS TO

00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:01.991
HELP FAMILIES EVEN IN THE FAMILY

00:56:02.058 --> 00:56:03.993
LAW SYSTEM. SO IT'S PUTTING IN

00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:05.361
THOSE PREVENTION SERVICES AND

00:56:05.428 --> 00:56:11.067
SUPPORTS- THAT YOU KNOW. WHAT I

00:56:11.134 --> 00:56:14.738
GUESS RIGHT AWAY THAT YOU KNOW

00:56:14.804 --> 00:56:16.873
WE'D LIKE TO SEE THE ISSUES

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:18.007
ADDRESSED BEFORE THEY HAVE TO

00:56:18.074 --> 00:56:19.442
EVEN COME UNDER OUR SYSTEM I

00:56:19.509 --> 00:56:20.710
REALIZE IN THE FAMILY SYSTEM

00:56:20.777 --> 00:56:24.481
THAT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT BITES-

00:56:24.547 --> 00:56:26.483
I THINK IT COMES TO YOU KNOW

00:56:26.549 --> 00:56:29.819
BETTER TRAINING- AND FOR SOCIAL

00:56:29.886 --> 00:56:31.187
WORKERS AND FOR THOSE THAT ARE

00:56:31.254 --> 00:56:32.255
COMING INTO CONTACT WITH THESE

00:56:32.322 --> 00:56:34.624
FAMILIES- I THINK WE'VE HEARD

00:56:34.691 --> 00:56:38.128
TODAY JUST A VARIETY OF WAYS

00:56:38.194 --> 00:56:40.029
THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE- CAN

00:56:40.096 --> 00:56:41.664
MANIFEST AND MANY PEOPLE AREN'T

00:56:41.731 --> 00:56:44.701
AWARE OF THAT- SO BEING ABLE TO

00:56:44.768 --> 00:56:47.003
ADDRESS THIS IN A PREVENTATIVE

00:56:47.070 --> 00:56:48.738
MANNER EARLY ON. I APPRECIATE

00:56:48.805 --> 00:56:49.906

THE SUPPORT SERVICES SO THAT. WE

00:56:54.677 --> 00:56:55.178
DON'T END UP IN THIS IN THE

00:56:55.245 --> 00:56:57.947
SYSTEM. OURSELVES FAMILIES DON'T

00:56:58.014 --> 00:56:58.915
END UP IN THE SYSTEM IF THEY CAN

00:56:58.982 --> 00:57:00.083
AVOID IT THEY CAN MAKE THE

00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:01.518
DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES ABOUT

00:57:01.584 --> 00:57:04.020
HAVING TO GO TO COURT AND- FIGHT

00:57:04.087 --> 00:57:06.656
IT OUT IN FRONT OF A JUDGE.

TIME. THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK

WAS- BILLION LIGHTNING AND I

00:57:21.337 --> 00:57:22.572
THINK YOU TOUCHED ON SOMETHING

00:57:22.639 --> 00:57:24.040
THAT JUST CAUGHT MY ATTENTION

00:57:24.107 --> 00:57:25.642
WHICH IS THE INTERGENERATIONAL

00:57:25.708 --> 00:57:28.511
VIOLENCE ON AND WHAT HAPPENS TO

00:57:28.578 --> 00:57:30.346
THOSE VICTIMS OF THE CHILDREN

00:57:30.413 --> 00:57:32.315
IMPACTED BY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE-

00:57:32.382 --> 00:57:33.917
AND I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW BEING A

00:57:33.983 --> 00:57:36.119
TEACHER FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS-

00:57:36.186 --> 00:57:38.188
USUALLY I CAN SPOT SOMEONE. A

00:57:38.254 --> 00:57:39.355
CHILD THAT'S BEEN EXPERIENCING

00:57:39.422 --> 00:57:40.957
SOME TRAUMA IN THE HOME BECAUSE

00:57:41.024 --> 00:57:42.592
YOU START SEEING SOME OF THE

00:57:42.659 --> 00:57:45.094
CHANGES IN ACADEMIC. UPGRADES

00:57:45.161 --> 00:57:47.797
AND CHANGES IN BEHAVIOR AND SO

00:57:47.864 --> 00:57:48.965
ONE OF MY BIGGEST CONCERNS AND

00:57:49.032 --> 00:57:51.668
CHALLENGES WHAT YOU STATED- WHEN

00:57:51.734 --> 00:57:53.436
YOU REMOVE A CHILD FROM A

00:57:53.503 --> 00:57:55.171
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HOME. THEY

00:57:55.238 --> 00:57:57.173
DON'T HAVE NECESSARILY A GOOD

00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:59.108
MODEL OF WHAT A HEALTHY

00:57:59.175 --> 00:58:01.110
RELATIONSHIP IS THEY DON'T HAVE.

00:58:01.177 --> 00:58:03.179
ANY OTHER EXAMPLE SO IT'S I

00:58:03.246 --> 00:58:04.147
GUESS IT'S SOMETHING THAT I

00:58:04.214 --> 00:58:05.281
THINK WE NEED TO EXPLORE A

00:58:05.348 --> 00:58:07.116
LITTLE FURTHER HAD DO WE GET

00:58:07.183 --> 00:58:09.185
THOSE SERVICES TO THOSE.

00:58:09.252 --> 00:58:10.520
CHILDREN IMPACTED BY DOMESTIC

00:58:10.587 --> 00:58:14.090
VIOLENCE HOW DO WE GET THE MOM

00:58:14.157 --> 00:58:15.124
TO TWENTY STAND WHAT A HEALTHY

00:58:15.191 --> 00:58:16.192
RELATIONSHIP IS AND SO IT'S

00:58:16.259 --> 00:58:18.027
SOMETHING THAT- I WOULD JUST

00:58:18.094 --> 00:58:19.162
KEEP IN THE BACK OF MY MIND AND

00:58:19.229 --> 00:58:21.130
HOPEFULLY WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW

00:58:21.197 --> 00:58:22.665
TO CHANGE THAT BEHAVIOR SO IT

00:58:22.732 --> 00:58:24.467
DOESN'T CONTINUE GENERATIONALLY

00:58:24.534 --> 00:58:26.202
STILL. THANK YOU FOR THAT SO NOW

00:58:26.269 --> 00:58:27.704

I THINK WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL

00:59:08.811 --> 00:59:10.346
UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE

00:59:10.413 --> 00:59:11.848

THAT'S TELLING. SO I MY NAME IS

00:59:18.121 --> 00:59:19.889
BRIAN OKAMOTO I AM A PUBLIC

00:59:19.956 --> 00:59:21.457
DEFENDER IN ORANGE COUNTY I DID

00:59:21.524 --> 00:59:22.959
CRIMINAL LAW FOR FIFTEEN YEARS

00:59:23.026 --> 00:59:24.460
AND NOW INDEPENDENT STATES IN

00:59:24.527 --> 00:59:26.229
AFRICA. OR WHEREVER SENT

00:59:26.296 --> 00:59:28.364
PARENTS. THE LAWS OBVIOUSLY

00:59:28.431 --> 00:59:29.732
DIFFERENT HERE THAN IT CRAMPED

00:59:29.799 --> 00:59:33.169
THE POPULATION WE SERVICE THE

00:59:33.236 --> 00:59:34.137
SAME. A SEMESTER HERE ARE.

00:59:34.203 --> 00:59:35.905
PARENTS WHO STRUGGLE WITH ABJECT

00:59:35.972 --> 00:59:38.908
POVERTY. SUBSTANCE USE ISSUES-

00:59:38.975 --> 00:59:40.910
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE MENTAL HEALTH.

00:59:40.977 --> 00:59:43.079
AND SOME AND OFTEN THESE THESE

00:59:43.146 --> 00:59:44.447
SYMPTOMS THAT WE SEE. ARE

00:59:44.514 --> 00:59:46.683
EXACERBATED BY THE CHILD WELFARE

00:59:46.749 --> 00:59:48.551
SYSTEM THAT REMOVES CHOKE. SO

00:59:48.618 --> 00:59:50.653
WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY-

00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:54.290
ARE BASICALLY TWO THINGS ONE- I

00:59:54.357 --> 00:59:55.692
DON'T WANNA GO OVER TOO MUCH IN

00:59:55.758 --> 00:59:56.592
THE LAW I THINK THAT'S BEEN

00:59:56.659 --> 00:59:58.461
COVERED BUT I DID WANT TO TOUCH

00:59:58.528 --> 01:00:02.765
UPON THAT. BUT ALSO TO DESCRIBE

01:00:02.832 --> 01:00:04.133
THAT FROM MY POINT OF VIEW OF

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:05.635
HOW THE SYSTEM ACTUALLY WORKS.

01:00:05.702 --> 01:00:07.670
AND I HOPE THAT AS I TALK ABOUT

01:00:07.737 --> 01:00:09.939
THESE TOPICS THAT THE FEW POINTS

01:00:10.006 --> 01:00:12.542
REALLY CUT TO LIGHT. ONE IS THAT

01:00:12.608 --> 01:00:14.277
THE STATUTES AND STANDARDS OF

01:00:14.344 --> 01:00:15.945
REVIEW THAT GOVERN OUR DECISIONS

01:00:16.012 --> 01:00:17.347
ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HERE IN

01:00:17.413 --> 01:00:19.916
DEPENDENCY. ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO

01:00:19.983 --> 01:00:21.484
BIAS SEES AND MISGUIDED

01:00:21.551 --> 01:00:24.220
PRECONCEPTIONS OKAY DO ALLOW FOR

01:00:24.287 --> 01:00:25.722
PUNITIVE AND SOMETIMES

01:00:25.788 --> 01:00:27.423
OVERSIMPLIFIED REACTIONS THAT

01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:29.959
CAN PUNISH NOT JUST DEFENDING

01:00:30.026 --> 01:00:32.028
PARENTS. BUT THE ABUSE THE

01:00:32.095 --> 01:00:33.396
PARENTS AS WELL AND EVEN THE

01:00:33.463 --> 01:00:35.531
CHILD AND I THINK THE PREVIOUS

01:00:35.598 --> 01:00:38.468
PANELISTS ADDRESSED THAT. TOO

01:00:38.534 --> 01:00:40.203
THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS

01:00:40.269 --> 01:00:42.939
COMPLEX AND NUANCED AND JOE WE

01:00:43.006 --> 01:00:44.741
TALKED ABOUT THIS ALREADY AND

01:00:44.807 --> 01:00:45.641
THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE

01:00:45.708 --> 01:00:47.643
APPROACHING- ADDRESSING THESE

01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:48.878
FAMILIES AND DEPENDENCY COURTS

01:00:48.945 --> 01:00:50.246
WITH A ONE SIZE FITS ALL

01:00:50.313 --> 01:00:52.382
APPROACH THAT'S NOT JUST ASK THE

01:00:52.448 --> 01:00:53.649
DETERMINATIONS THAT WE MAKE

01:00:53.716 --> 01:00:54.851
COURT SUCH AS WHETHER OR NOT WE

01:00:54.917 --> 01:00:56.619
START JURISDICTION. OR MOVE

01:00:56.686 --> 01:00:58.988
CHOKE AND RETURN SHELLS BUT IT

01:00:59.055 --> 01:01:01.424
ALSO HAS TO DO WITH HOW WE

01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:02.892
PROVIDE SERVICES TO THESE

01:01:02.959 --> 01:01:05.094
FAMILIES WE SHOULD NOT HAVE A

01:01:05.161 --> 01:01:05.695
ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH TO

01:01:05.762 --> 01:01:08.331
THAT AS WELL. AS THIRD THAT

01:01:08.398 --> 01:01:09.966
THERE HAVE BEEN RECENT APPELLATE

01:01:10.033 --> 01:01:12.735
OPINIONS TO TWENTY TWENTY AND

01:01:12.802 --> 01:01:13.336
TWENTY TWENTY ONE ON DOMESTIC

01:01:13.403 --> 01:01:14.904
VIOLENCE INDEPENDENT STATE. AND

01:01:14.971 --> 01:01:16.372
WHILE THOSE OPINIONS ARE

01:01:16.439 --> 01:01:17.874
EXTREMELY ENCOURAGING BECAUSE OF

01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:22.845
BRINGING TO LIGHT. A LOT OF THE

01:01:22.912 --> 01:01:23.446
CAR THAT THE IT. THE RESEARCH

01:01:23.513 --> 01:01:24.313
UNDER BUYING AND GIVING SOME

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:25.748
MORE ACCURATE ON THAT. THEY'RE

01:01:25.815 --> 01:01:27.417
ALSO CONCERNING BECAUSE HE'S OUR

01:01:27.483 --> 01:01:28.851
RECENT OPINIONS AND THOSE

01:01:28.918 --> 01:01:32.789
DECISIONS ARE BASED ON. IT HE-

01:01:32.855 --> 01:01:34.690
ARGUMENTS AND DECISIONS MADE IN

01:01:34.757 --> 01:01:35.958
OUR TRIAL COURTS AND WHAT THEY

01:01:36.025 --> 01:01:37.960
DO IS THEY REVEAL. THAT OUR

01:01:38.027 --> 01:01:41.397
SYSTEM HERE SOMETIMES WILL

01:01:41.464 --> 01:01:42.965
OPERATE ON A MISGUIDED CULTURE.

01:01:43.032 --> 01:01:44.200
A MISUNDERSTANDING OF DOMESTIC

01:01:44.267 --> 01:01:46.102
VIOLENCE AND THAT THERE IS A

01:01:46.169 --> 01:01:47.770
NEED FOR EDUCATION REFORM. AND

01:01:47.837 --> 01:01:50.606
SO I APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY

01:01:50.673 --> 01:01:53.042
I'M A LET ME JUST JUMP IN. SO

01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:54.210
JULIE MENTIONED THAT I WOULD BE

01:01:54.277 --> 01:01:56.412
TOUCHING ON SECTION. B. AND I

01:01:56.479 --> 01:01:57.213
KNOW THAT ON YOUR ALREADY

01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:58.981
ADDRESSED AS WELL SO THIS IS

01:01:59.048 --> 01:02:00.183
JURISDICTION WHEN THE COURT

01:02:00.249 --> 01:02:01.984
TAKES JURISDICTION OVER CASE THE

01:02:02.051 --> 01:02:03.786
COURT HEARING DEPENDENCY TEXTERS

01:02:03.853 --> 01:02:05.421
DICTION OVER THE CHILD NOT THE

01:02:05.488 --> 01:02:06.856
PARENTS. THE PURPOSE OF

01:02:06.923 --> 01:02:08.257
DEPENDENCY IS NOT TO PUNISH

01:02:08.324 --> 01:02:11.294
PARENTS TO PROTECT CHILDREN AND

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:13.129
TO REUNIFY FAMILIES THOSE ARE

01:02:13.196 --> 01:02:15.598
MANDATES. SO THREE HUNDRED B. IS

01:02:15.665 --> 01:02:17.100
THE CODE SECTION THAT WE REFER

01:02:17.166 --> 01:02:18.334
TO AS THE FAILURE TO EXTRACT

01:02:18.401 --> 01:02:20.269
YOUR- BASICALLY THREE ELEMENTS

01:02:20.336 --> 01:02:21.971
THE COURTS LOOKING FOR ONE WAS

01:02:22.038 --> 01:02:23.739
THERE JUST THE PARENT. IS THE

01:02:23.806 --> 01:02:25.508
PARENT UNABLE TO PROVIDE

01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:26.642
NECESSARY SUPERVISION OR

01:02:26.709 --> 01:02:28.311
PROTECTION OF THE CHILD. AND

01:02:28.377 --> 01:02:32.281
CAUSATION YES THAT'S TRUE. THREE

01:02:32.348 --> 01:02:34.417
SERIOUS PHYSICAL HARM. OR

01:02:34.484 --> 01:02:36.886
ILLNESS OR SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF

01:02:36.953 --> 01:02:40.356
EITHER. SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN

01:02:40.423 --> 01:02:41.357
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHEN WE THINK

01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:44.127
ABOUT BURTON. RIGHT SO IS THIS A

01:02:44.193 --> 01:02:46.596
HIGH BURDEN IT'S ARGUABLY IT

01:02:46.662 --> 01:02:48.631
WOULD BE GREAT BECAUSE WE'RE

01:02:48.698 --> 01:02:50.166
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT ANY KIND

01:02:50.233 --> 01:02:51.267
OF RISK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A

01:02:51.334 --> 01:02:53.402
SUBSTANTIAL RISK RIGHT NOW WE'RE

01:02:53.469 --> 01:02:54.904
NOT TALKING ABOUT ANY KIND OF

01:02:54.971 --> 01:02:55.771
PHYSICAL MEMORY ON THIS WE'RE

01:02:55.838 --> 01:02:57.807
TALKING ABOUT. SERIOUS PHYSICAL

01:02:57.874 --> 01:02:59.709
HARM ADULTS WHAT EXACTLY DO

01:02:59.775 --> 01:03:01.444
THESE TERMS MEAN SUBSTANTIAL OR

01:03:01.511 --> 01:03:04.313
SERIOUS AND WHERE IS THAT LINE.

01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:06.115
FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WHEN IT IS

01:03:06.182 --> 01:03:08.951
A RISK VERSUS A SERIOUS RISK

01:03:09.018 --> 01:03:11.287
WHERE THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL YES

01:03:11.354 --> 01:03:13.189
OR- OR JUST A REGULAR RISK WHO

01:03:13.256 --> 01:03:14.323
MAKES THOSE DETERMINATIONS

01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:15.925
BECAUSE THE CODE DOESN'T PROVIDE

01:03:15.992 --> 01:03:22.331
US A CLEAR DEFINITION. WHERE

01:03:22.398 --> 01:03:22.965
THAT LINE IT'S- SO THE ANSWER TO

01:03:23.032 --> 01:03:24.233
THAT. AND WHO PROVIDES THIS LINE

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:26.269
. IS US THE PRACTITIONER. IT'S

01:03:26.335 --> 01:03:27.570
THE JUDGES IT'S THE SOCIAL

01:03:27.637 --> 01:03:30.339
WORKERS ALL OF US ARE THE ONES

01:03:30.406 --> 01:03:31.107
THAT ARE TRYING TO APPLY THE

01:03:31.174 --> 01:03:33.843
STANDARD. AND THE MOST UNIFORM

01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:36.312
WAY POSSIBLE. BUT WE'RE HUMANS

01:03:36.379 --> 01:03:37.847
AND WE ALL BRING FORCED OUR

01:03:37.914 --> 01:03:39.015
UNDERSTANDINGS OR

01:03:39.081 --> 01:03:41.083
INTERPRETATIONS CIRCUMSTANCE

01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:45.254
FACTS AND YES MR VIOLENCE. AND

01:03:45.321 --> 01:03:45.788
THAT SHOULD BE CONCERNING

01:03:45.855 --> 01:03:47.190
SOMETIMES. BUT THE ROLE OF THE

01:03:47.256 --> 01:03:48.558
SOCIAL WORKER IS ABSOLUTELY

01:03:48.624 --> 01:03:50.193
CRITICAL AS WELL BECAUSE THE

01:03:50.259 --> 01:03:50.993
SOCIAL WORKERS MAKING

01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:53.062
RECOMMENDATIONS TO WORK TO THE

01:03:53.129 --> 01:03:54.463
COURT WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD

01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:56.132
ASSERT JURISDICTION WHETHER OR

01:03:56.199 --> 01:03:57.133
NOT WE SHOULD REMOVE CHILDREN'S

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:59.135
PARENTS THE SOCIAL WORKERS ARE

01:03:59.202 --> 01:04:01.070
GIVING THESE RECOMMENDATIONS AND

01:04:01.137 --> 01:04:02.138
ARE GIVEN GREAT WEIGHT BY THE

01:04:02.205 --> 01:04:04.040
JUDGE RIGHT. BECAUSE SOCIAL

01:04:04.106 --> 01:04:07.443
WORKERS ARE DEEMED AS IMPARTIAL

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:09.946
ARMS OF THE COURT. IN FACT

01:04:10.012 --> 01:04:11.247
HEARSAY IS ADMISSIBLE IN THE

01:04:11.314 --> 01:04:13.416
SOCIAL WORK REPORTS BECAUSE OF

01:04:13.482 --> 01:04:14.850
THEIR RECOGNIZED

01:04:14.917 --> 01:04:17.286
PROFESSIONALISM- THAT THEY'RE

01:04:17.353 --> 01:04:18.554
RELIABLE AND THAT THEIR

01:04:18.621 --> 01:04:21.324
UNBIASED. SO IT IS ABSOLUTELY

01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:23.492
CRITICAL EVERYONE IN OUR SYSTEM

01:04:23.559 --> 01:04:25.194
AND ESPECIALLY THE SOCIAL

01:04:25.261 --> 01:04:27.196
WORKERS INVOLVED ARE UP TO DATE

01:04:27.263 --> 01:04:30.333
AND AWARE. OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:04:30.399 --> 01:04:31.534
AND THEIR ACT THEY HAVE AN

01:04:31.601 --> 01:04:33.069
ACCURATE UNDERSTANDING OF THAT

01:04:33.135 --> 01:04:34.971
BECAUSE THE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:04:35.037 --> 01:04:36.105
CARRY GREAT WEIGHT IN OUR

01:04:36.172 --> 01:04:39.175
COURTS. SO IF WE DON'T IF WE S.

01:04:39.242 --> 01:04:40.543
PROTECT ACTIVE SHOOTERS JUDGES

01:04:40.610 --> 01:04:42.678
AND SOCIAL WORKERS DON'T FULLY

01:04:42.745 --> 01:04:43.946
REALIZE THE REALITIES OF

01:04:44.013 --> 01:04:45.715
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. BUT OFTEN

01:04:45.781 --> 01:04:46.916
TIMES WE'LL DO IS WE'LL RELY

01:04:46.983 --> 01:04:49.518
TRANSIENTS AND PRECONCEPTIONS

01:04:49.585 --> 01:04:51.220
AND THAT MAKES US GROUND. AROUND

01:04:51.287 --> 01:04:52.822
HIS DECISION FAMILIES ON

01:04:52.888 --> 01:04:54.357
IMPORTANT ISSUES. LIKE WHETHER

01:04:54.423 --> 01:04:55.291
OR NOT WE SHOULD REUNIFY

01:04:55.358 --> 01:04:57.593
FAMILIES WITH SEPARATED CHILD

01:04:57.660 --> 01:04:59.428
FROM THE PARENTS. RIGHT AND

01:04:59.495 --> 01:05:01.197
SLIPS FURTHER TRAUMA IN CHILDREN

01:05:01.264 --> 01:05:02.798
AND WORST CASE SCENARIO EVEN

01:05:02.865 --> 01:05:05.234
TERMINATION OF PARENTAL RIGHTS.

01:05:05.301 --> 01:05:06.402
SO IN PRACTICE WHAT IT LOOKS

01:05:06.469 --> 01:05:08.170
LIKE WE'VE HEARD BOTH PANELISTS

01:05:08.237 --> 01:05:10.072
TALKED ABOUT FAILURE TO PROTECT.

01:05:10.139 --> 01:05:11.941
THE AREA WHERE WE CAN SOMETIMES

01:05:12.008 --> 01:05:14.243
ACTUALLY REMOVE A CHILD FROM AN

01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:15.711
ABUSIVE PARENT AND I'VE HAD

01:05:15.778 --> 01:05:17.246
SITUATIONS WHERE I'VE HAD

01:05:17.313 --> 01:05:19.081
CONVERSATIONS WITH MY CLIENTS

01:05:19.148 --> 01:05:20.449
BUT THAT IS BEING DISCUSSED. AND

01:05:20.516 --> 01:05:22.285
WE'RE ON THE BRINK OF THE COURT

01:05:22.351 --> 01:05:23.386
REMOVING THE CHILD FROM THAT

01:05:23.452 --> 01:05:25.821
PARENTS CARE. THAT PARENT LOOKS

01:05:25.888 --> 01:05:28.591
AT ME CONFUSED WONDERING WHY.

01:05:28.658 --> 01:05:34.630
HAVING JUST BEEN ABUSE. THE

01:05:34.697 --> 01:05:35.264
COURT WOULD TAKE AWAY MY CHILD.

01:05:35.331 --> 01:05:36.065
WHY WOULD THE COURT. TO THAT

01:05:36.132 --> 01:05:38.067
TRAUMA WITH ADDITIONAL TRAUMA BY

01:05:38.134 --> 01:05:39.669
REMOVING THAT CHILD IT'S

01:05:39.735 --> 01:05:40.870
ABSOLUTELY TRAGIC FOR THE

01:05:40.936 --> 01:05:43.306
CHILD'S SPOT ACTUALLY AND IT'S

01:05:43.372 --> 01:05:45.875
TRAGIC FOR THAT PARENT AS WELL-

01:05:45.941 --> 01:05:46.809
THE PARENT DOESN'T UNDERSTAND

01:05:46.876 --> 01:05:49.412
HOW THE SYSTEM WOULD WANT TO.

01:05:49.478 --> 01:05:51.480
PLACE THAT CHILD. IN A

01:05:51.547 --> 01:05:54.150
STRANGER'S HOME. FOR A COTTAGE

01:05:54.216 --> 01:05:55.384
WITH OTHER STRANGERS IN THE

01:05:55.451 --> 01:05:57.119
CHILD NOT KNOWING WHEN HERE

01:05:57.186 --> 01:05:58.087
SHE'S GOING TO GO BACK TO THE

01:05:58.154 --> 01:05:59.655
PARENTS AND ESPECIALLY AT THIS

01:05:59.722 --> 01:06:01.157
IMPORTANT INSTANCE FRIGHTENING

01:06:01.223 --> 01:06:03.092
TIME AFTER A MASSIVE PROBLEMS

01:06:03.159 --> 01:06:04.760
OCCURRED. THESE ARE REAL

01:06:04.827 --> 01:06:06.696
CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR

01:06:06.762 --> 01:06:08.264
SYSTEM AND I KNOW THERE'S BEEN

01:06:08.331 --> 01:06:09.999
SOME DEBATE ON THIS TOPIC AND

01:06:10.066 --> 01:06:11.434
HOW WE SHOULD PROBABLY WEAR THIS

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:15.438
BUT I THINK AS A STARTING POINT

01:06:15.504 --> 01:06:16.105
WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE. THAT WE TO

01:06:16.172 --> 01:06:17.973
PAUSE. BEFORE WE DO SOMETHING

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:19.041
LIKE THIS WE SHOULD HAVE WE

01:06:19.108 --> 01:06:20.509
SHOULD HAVE GUIDELINES IN PLACE

01:06:20.576 --> 01:06:22.211
TO PREVENT THIS OR MAKE IT MORE

01:06:22.278 --> 01:06:24.880
DIFFICULT- I KNOW IT'S BEEN

01:06:24.947 --> 01:06:27.049
DISCUSSED. BUT I THINK IF WE ALL

01:06:27.116 --> 01:06:29.852
FOCUS ON THE TRAUMA THAT BOTH

01:06:29.919 --> 01:06:31.887
CHILDREN AND PARENTS SUFFER FROM

01:06:31.954 --> 01:06:33.055
THIS REMOVAL UNDER THE

01:06:33.122 --> 01:06:34.657
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE CAN COME

01:06:34.724 --> 01:06:37.259
TO A CONSENSUS. IN SOME WAY AND

01:06:37.326 --> 01:06:40.730
SO I. ACTUALLY APPLAUD. SENATE

01:06:40.796 --> 01:06:42.131
ROUTE SENATOR RUBIO AND

01:06:42.198 --> 01:06:43.799
EVERYONE'S EFFORTS TO GET

01:06:43.866 --> 01:06:45.968
SOMETHING PASSED ON THIS END I

01:06:46.035 --> 01:06:47.370
GRATEFUL FOR THE VOICES BEFORE

01:06:47.436 --> 01:06:49.238
ME THAT SPOKE ON THIS AS WELL.

01:06:49.305 --> 01:06:52.074
SO IT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT BY.

01:06:52.141 --> 01:06:54.310
JULIE ABOUT- ARE CONCERNED ABOUT

01:06:54.377 --> 01:06:55.611
THE ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH

01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:57.313
DEPENDENCY WHEN IT COMES TO

01:06:57.380 --> 01:07:00.082
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THAT IS FRONT

01:07:00.149 --> 01:07:01.817
AND CENTER ONE OF MY STUDENTS

01:07:01.884 --> 01:07:03.319
BECAUSE THE EASIER CASES ACTION

01:07:03.386 --> 01:07:05.321
OKAY RIGHT EASIER. BUT THE

01:07:05.388 --> 01:07:06.322
OBVIOUS CASES ARE THOSE WHERE WE

01:07:06.389 --> 01:07:08.524
SEE CLEARLY WHO THE ABUSER ISN'T

01:07:08.591 --> 01:07:11.427
WRITTEN IT IS S. BUT SOMETIMES

01:07:11.494 --> 01:07:13.062
IT'S NOT SO CRYSTAL CLEAR. AND

01:07:13.129 --> 01:07:14.363
WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE

01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:16.165
BEST THAT VIOLENCE. SHOULD BE

01:07:16.232 --> 01:07:17.700
EXHIBITED IN DIFFERENT WEIGHTS

01:07:17.767 --> 01:07:19.268
THERE ARE PATTERNS AND CYCLES OF

01:07:19.335 --> 01:07:20.436
VIOLENCE BUT THEY'RE ALSO

01:07:20.503 --> 01:07:21.971
DIFFERENT DEGREES OF THAT. AND

01:07:22.037 --> 01:07:23.839
THERE ARE TIMES ABSOLUTELY

01:07:23.906 --> 01:07:25.307
INTERVENE AND REMOVE CHILDREN

01:07:25.374 --> 01:07:26.742
BUT THERE ARE ALSO TIMES AND WE

01:07:26.809 --> 01:07:27.910
SHOULDN'T EVEN EXERCISE

01:07:27.977 --> 01:07:30.146
JURISDICTION IN THE CASE. AND

01:07:30.212 --> 01:07:32.047
IT'S THOSE NUANCES THAT I THINK

01:07:32.114 --> 01:07:33.682
SOMETIMES GET LOST WE APPROACH

01:07:33.749 --> 01:07:36.018
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ONE SIZE FITS

01:07:36.085 --> 01:07:38.320
ALL APPROACH WE HAVEN'T READ

01:07:38.387 --> 01:07:40.356
OVER REACTS AND STATS WE SHOULD

01:07:40.423 --> 01:07:42.057
WE SHOULD HAVE TO. WHAT WE END

01:07:42.124 --> 01:07:43.826
UP TRAUMATISING CHILDREN IN THE

01:07:43.893 --> 01:07:49.832
PROCESS. SO- WHAT WHAT DOES THAT

01:07:49.899 --> 01:07:50.933
LIKE WHAT. I WILL TO TALK ABOUT

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:51.867
THESE OPINION BECAUSE THAT WAY

01:07:51.934 --> 01:07:53.636
IT'S NOT JUST ME SPOUTING OUT

01:07:53.702 --> 01:07:54.503
SOME OF THE THINGS I'VE

01:07:54.570 --> 01:07:56.772
EXPERIENCED IN MY KIDS. YOU CAN

01:07:56.839 --> 01:07:58.240
LOOK AT THE COURT OPINIONS AND

01:07:58.307 --> 01:08:01.110
SEE WHAT OCCURRED. IN RACHAEL L.

01:08:01.177 --> 01:08:02.578
THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE CASE IT

01:08:02.645 --> 01:08:04.947
JUST CAME DOWN RECENTLY. AND IN

01:08:05.014 --> 01:08:05.714
THIS CASE THE COURT OF APPEALS

01:08:05.781 --> 01:08:07.550
FOUND THAT THE JUVENILE COURT

01:08:07.616 --> 01:08:09.852
AARON EACH FINDING JURISDICTION.

01:08:09.919 --> 01:08:11.220
AND TEAR THE JUVENILE COURT

01:08:11.287 --> 01:08:12.188
FOUND THAT THERE WAS

01:08:12.254 --> 01:08:13.722
JURISDICTION UNDER THREE HUNDRED

01:08:13.789 --> 01:08:17.126
FEET. BECAUSE OF THE PARENTS

01:08:17.193 --> 01:08:19.061
LONG HISTORY. OF DOMESTIC

01:08:19.128 --> 01:08:20.796
VIOLENCE ISSUES AND THE MOTHER'S

01:08:20.863 --> 01:08:22.465
REFUSAL TO PARTICIPATE IN

01:08:22.531 --> 01:08:26.101
SERVICES THE SERVICES WORK ORDER

01:08:26.168 --> 01:08:28.437
. AND THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF

01:08:28.504 --> 01:08:30.306
MULTIPLE ACTS OF DOMESTIC

01:08:30.372 --> 01:08:31.307
VIOLENCE OVER EXTENDED PERIOD OF

01:08:31.373 --> 01:08:33.008
TIME. IN FACT THERE WAS ONE

01:08:33.075 --> 01:08:34.977
INCIDENT IT WAS AN INCIDENT

01:08:35.044 --> 01:08:37.112
INVOLVING QUESTION SHOVING AND

01:08:37.179 --> 01:08:38.781
GRABBING OVER A CELL PHONE THAT

01:08:38.848 --> 01:08:40.316
OCCURRED NINE MONTHS PRIOR TO

01:08:40.382 --> 01:08:43.052
THE HEARING. SO NINE MONTHS THE

01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:44.587
MOTHER LIVE WITH A CHILD WITH NO

01:08:44.653 --> 01:08:46.455
PROBLEMS THERE WAS NO ACCIDENTS

01:08:46.522 --> 01:08:47.490
THE PILOTS THE FATHER'S

01:08:47.556 --> 01:08:49.725
WHEREABOUTS WERE UNKNOWN AND

01:08:49.792 --> 01:08:50.426
MOM. VINGTAINE A RESTRAINING

01:08:50.493 --> 01:08:52.261
ORDER. THE COURT APPEALS

01:08:52.328 --> 01:08:54.330
DISMISSED THIS PETITION. AND SO

01:08:54.396 --> 01:08:56.298
WHAT IT SAYS LOOK WE CAN APPLY

01:08:56.365 --> 01:08:57.633
THE CORPORATE FROM BRITAIN'S

01:08:57.700 --> 01:08:59.301
DECISION BUT WE HAVE TO

01:08:59.368 --> 01:09:03.138
RECOGNIZE ALSO THAT THE TRIAL.

01:09:03.205 --> 01:09:03.806
COURT MADE A DECISION. FOR

01:09:03.873 --> 01:09:06.408
JURISDICTION. WITHOUT SUPPORTING

01:09:06.475 --> 01:09:09.144
EVIDENCE. AND THAT IS JUST ONE

01:09:09.211 --> 01:09:13.182
CASE THERE ARE OTHERS. SO IT

01:09:13.249 --> 01:09:15.084
BEGS THE QUESTION. WHAT EXACTLY

01:09:15.150 --> 01:09:16.252
IS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THEN THAT

01:09:16.318 --> 01:09:18.287
WOULD SUPPORT YOUR SECTION WHAT

01:09:18.354 --> 01:09:21.724
IS EXACTLY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. WE

01:09:21.790 --> 01:09:24.627
SOMETIMES ANSWER THIS BY OUR

01:09:24.693 --> 01:09:26.462
WITH OUR EXPECTATIONS AND OUR

01:09:26.529 --> 01:09:29.031
PRECONCEPTIONS. WITH THIS ONE

01:09:29.098 --> 01:09:31.300
SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH EFFECTIVE

01:09:31.367 --> 01:09:32.334
VICTIM MUST LOOK LOOK A CERTAIN

01:09:32.401 --> 01:09:34.470
WAY OR BEHAVE A CERTAIN WAY IT'S

01:09:34.537 --> 01:09:35.971
A BIG IF THE VICTIM MOTHER IS

01:09:36.038 --> 01:09:37.573
NOT DOING SERVICES THAT MEAN SHE

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:41.110
DOESN'T CARE RIGHT. IF SHE'S NOT

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:43.078
SOFT SPOKEN OR SEEMINGLY

01:09:43.145 --> 01:09:45.481
FRIGHTENS THAT WE ASSUME THAT

01:09:45.548 --> 01:09:46.248
SHE MIGHT BE JUST MORE

01:09:46.315 --> 01:09:48.684
AGGRESSIVE OR MORE DIFFICULT

01:09:48.751 --> 01:09:50.519
THERE IS NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL

01:09:50.586 --> 01:09:51.253
APPROACH THIS AND I THINK IT

01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:53.088
DOWN ON YOUR BED MENTION THIS

01:09:53.155 --> 01:09:54.523
THAT SOMETIMES THAT BATTERS YOU

01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:56.358
REALLY SOPHISTICATED AND MAKE IT

01:09:56.425 --> 01:09:58.160
THEIR OWN AND WIN OVER SOCIAL

01:09:58.227 --> 01:10:00.062
WORKERS AND JUDGES IT COULD BE

01:10:00.129 --> 01:10:01.997
CHARISMATIC RELATE TO AUTHORITY

01:10:02.064 --> 01:10:05.501
FIGURES. AND THEY CAN THEY CAN.

01:10:05.568 --> 01:10:08.137
GET IT VANISHED IN THESE COURTS

01:10:08.203 --> 01:10:13.008
OVER- SO. WE'RE OVERLOOKING AS

01:10:13.075 --> 01:10:14.243
THE TRUE VICTIM. SO THERE ARE

01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:18.514
SOME OF THIS OF HOW WE HAVE

01:10:18.581 --> 01:10:21.016
THESE EXPECTATIONS ROLES RIGHT

01:10:21.083 --> 01:10:22.952
I'D E IS A TWENTY TWENTY SIX

01:10:23.018 --> 01:10:24.320
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE WALL

01:10:24.386 --> 01:10:26.322
OF A SO CALLED VICTIM ISN'T

01:10:26.388 --> 01:10:28.857
REALLY CLEAR THE CASE CAME IN

01:10:28.924 --> 01:10:30.559
BECAUSE THE MOTHER LASHED OUT AT

01:10:30.626 --> 01:10:32.494
HER USER I. THROWING SOMETHING

01:10:32.561 --> 01:10:34.096
ADAM BUT LATER IT WAS REVEALED

01:10:34.163 --> 01:10:35.531
THAT THE FATHER HAD JEALOUS

01:10:35.598 --> 01:10:37.600
RAGES ISOLATOR IS ECHOED USE

01:10:37.666 --> 01:10:39.501
THAT ANGER HER VERBAL ABUSE TO

01:10:39.568 --> 01:10:41.170
HARM HERSELF STEAM AND

01:10:41.236 --> 01:10:42.671
INDEPENDENCE AND TAUNTED HER

01:10:42.738 --> 01:10:46.375
KNOWING ME KNOWING THAT IT WOULD

01:10:46.442 --> 01:10:47.009
TRIGGER A PHYSICAL REACTION. SO

01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:48.410
NOT ALWAYS. AND I THINK WE

01:10:48.477 --> 01:10:50.145
SHOULD AVOID MAKING BREAST RUSS

01:10:50.212 --> 01:10:53.649
SNAP JUDGMENTS ON THIS- AND WHAT

01:10:53.716 --> 01:10:56.318
WE EXPECTED THEM TO ACT LIKE SO-

01:10:56.385 --> 01:10:59.355
ANY CASE IN REMEDY WHICH IS ALSO

01:10:59.421 --> 01:10:59.822
TWENTY TWENTY CASE MY

01:10:59.888 --> 01:11:02.157
JURISDICTION. IN THAT CASE THE

01:11:02.224 --> 01:11:03.692
JUVENILE COURT FOCUSED ON

01:11:03.759 --> 01:11:05.694
MOTHER'S PAST AS A VICTIM OF

01:11:05.761 --> 01:11:08.263
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND NOTED THAT

01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:09.465
SHE WAS UNCOOPERATIVE THE

01:11:09.531 --> 01:11:12.201
SUBSTANCE SIX DESPITE BEING TEN

01:11:12.267 --> 01:11:13.736
MONTHS FREE THE FATHER. THE

01:11:13.802 --> 01:11:16.839
COURT STILL- TOOK ISSUE WITH

01:11:16.905 --> 01:11:19.908
MOM- HE RECORDED APPEALS

01:11:19.975 --> 01:11:22.645
RECOGNIZED STATED THIS ACTUALLY.

01:11:22.711 --> 01:11:23.846
THERE WAS A RECENT TROUBLING

01:11:23.912 --> 01:11:25.414
TREND OF WHAT THEY PERCEIVE AS

01:11:25.481 --> 01:11:27.616
MOTHERS BEING VICTIMS OF

01:11:27.683 --> 01:11:29.218
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND THAT MAY

01:11:29.284 --> 01:11:30.853
BE ADDED THIS QUOTE WE EXPECT

01:11:30.919 --> 01:11:33.222
SUCH VICTIMS TO BE SWEET TRYING

01:11:33.288 --> 01:11:34.790
TO WEAR BLACK LESS FRIGHTENED

01:11:34.857 --> 01:11:36.358
AND HELP US AND NOT. A

01:11:36.425 --> 01:11:38.227
MULTIFACETED WOMAN WHO MAY OR

01:11:38.293 --> 01:11:39.895
MAY NOT EXPERIENCE FEAR ANGER.

01:11:39.962 --> 01:11:41.130
THESE ARE THE PRECONCEPTIONS

01:11:41.196 --> 01:11:42.231
THAT JUDGES AND JURORS BRING

01:11:42.297 --> 01:11:43.365
WITH THEM INTO THE COURTROOM AND

01:11:43.432 --> 01:11:45.200
DISTRUST OF RATIONALLY OCCURRED

01:11:45.267 --> 01:11:47.536
STORY WE ENCOURAGE CONTINUED

01:11:47.603 --> 01:11:51.507
DILIGENCE AND EDUCATION TO GUARD

01:11:51.573 --> 01:11:52.107
AGAINST SUCH PRECONCEPTIONS.

01:11:52.174 --> 01:11:53.676
WHAT ELSE DO WE IMPOSE OUR

01:11:53.742 --> 01:11:55.577
EXPECTATIONS WE HAVE THIS

01:11:55.644 --> 01:11:57.012
EXPECTATION THAT IN ORDER TO

01:11:57.079 --> 01:11:58.614
REUNIFY THE FAMILY OR CLOSE THE

01:11:58.681 --> 01:12:00.315
CASE OR ALLOW THE CHILDREN TO

01:12:00.382 --> 01:12:02.384
REMAIN WITH THE NOT SO CALLED

01:12:02.451 --> 01:12:04.653
NOT AFFECTING. THE PARENT HAS TO

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:07.189
DEMONSTRATE A SEPARATION FROM

01:12:07.256 --> 01:12:10.092
THE ABUSER BUT THAT'S ALSO A

01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:12.194
NEBULOUS CONCEPT BECAUSE- HOW

01:12:12.261 --> 01:12:14.296
LONG DOES THE PARENT HAVE TO BE

01:12:14.363 --> 01:12:17.733
SEPARATED FROM THE ABUSER. IN A

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:19.201
CASE THEN IN THAT CASE AND MAY I

01:12:19.268 --> 01:12:21.103
BE THAT TWENTY TWENTY CASE IN

01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:22.504
THAT CASE THAT THE JUVENILE

01:12:22.571 --> 01:12:24.506
COURT FOUND THAT EIGHT MONTHS OF

01:12:24.573 --> 01:12:26.508
SEPARATION JUST WASN'T. AGAIN

01:12:26.575 --> 01:12:27.676
RELIED ON THE HISTORY OF

01:12:27.743 --> 01:12:29.912
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND THE

01:12:29.978 --> 01:12:30.546
ARGUMENTS AND THERE WERE QUITE

01:12:30.612 --> 01:12:34.216
SHOCKING- MINUS COUNSELING AND

01:12:34.283 --> 01:12:35.284
THE COUNTY COUNCIL'S SOCIAL

01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:36.952
SERVICES ARGUED THAT THERE WAS

01:12:37.019 --> 01:12:38.520
QUOTE NO TRUE CHANGE OF

01:12:38.587 --> 01:12:41.790
CIRCUMSTANCES BECAUSE APART. AND

01:12:41.857 --> 01:12:43.058
HER PAST FAILURES TO SEPARATE

01:12:43.125 --> 01:12:44.693
YOURSELF FROM THE FATHER WERE

01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:46.462
CONCLUSIVE PROOF THAT THE

01:12:46.528 --> 01:12:48.230
INSPIRATION SHOULD PUT PROCESSED

01:12:48.297 --> 01:12:49.665
AND ONE EVEN ARGUED THAT THE

01:12:49.732 --> 01:12:51.033
BROTHERS QUOTE COMPULSIVE

01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:55.003
INVOLVEMENT. BUT THE FATHER- HAD

01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:57.506
NOT CEASED. THIS RECORD REPEAL

01:12:57.573 --> 01:12:59.308
TOOK ISSUE WITH IT SAID THAT

01:12:59.375 --> 01:13:00.242
THERE'S A SHOCKING LACK OF

01:13:00.309 --> 01:13:01.677
UNDERSTANDING ABOUT SURVIVORS OF

PERPETUATE THE MYTH OF THE HELP

01:13:07.549 --> 01:13:09.218
WAS WITH BATTERED WOMEN. THIS IS

01:13:09.284 --> 01:13:11.553
AGAIN AN EXAMPLE OF US IMPOSING

01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:15.324
OUR EXPECTATIONS. ON HOW-

01:13:15.390 --> 01:13:18.527
SURVIVORS NEED TO ACT BEFORE WE

01:13:18.594 --> 01:13:20.496

01:13:41.583 --> 01:13:43.819
SOME OF THESE INTERPRETATIONS-

01:13:43.886 --> 01:13:45.621
FORTUNATELY THE COURTS OF APPEAL

01:13:45.687 --> 01:13:47.089
HAVE BANNED UP VIGILANT. AND

01:13:47.156 --> 01:13:49.024

SOLVE EVERY CASE BUT IT DOESN'T

01:17:09.691 --> 01:17:10.993

01:20:05.167 --> 01:20:09.271
WE NEED TO ASK- THAT. THE DATE

01:20:09.337 --> 01:20:11.640
THEY PRODUCE THAT BECAUSE THESE

01:20:11.706 --> 01:20:15.177
COURT CASES ARE APPALLING- IT

01:20:15.243 --> 01:20:16.144
THERE IT'S GREAT THAT THEY WERE

01:20:16.211 --> 01:20:19.614
OVERTURNED BUT- BUT NOT TO HAVE

01:20:19.681 --> 01:20:23.852
FACTS UPON WHICH TO- TO START

01:20:23.919 --> 01:20:25.587
BREAKING UP FAMILIES THAT HAVE

01:20:25.654 --> 01:20:26.988
BEEN PARTICIPATING IN PROCESS

01:20:27.055 --> 01:20:28.490
SEES. AND DOING THE BEST THEY

01:20:28.557 --> 01:20:30.525
CAN I GUESS THAT'S MY CONCERN

01:20:30.592 --> 01:20:32.027
BUT THE OTHER THING IS THAT I'M

01:20:32.093 --> 01:20:33.028
I'M WONDERING IF ANYBODY'S DONE

01:20:33.094 --> 01:20:36.665
ANY. ANY STUDIES AROUND- ABOUT

01:20:36.731 --> 01:20:39.868
AROUND IT IMPLICIT. BIAS IN IN

01:20:39.935 --> 01:20:43.171
THE SYSTEM- I PRACTICED IN

01:20:43.238 --> 01:20:46.341
MOSTLY RURAL AGRICULTURAL AREA

01:20:46.408 --> 01:20:51.479
AND- FRANKLY THE JUDGES HAD NO.

01:20:51.546 --> 01:20:53.548
OUR CONNECTION TO MOST OF THE

01:20:53.615 --> 01:20:55.417
POOR PEOPLE THAT CAME IN THAT

01:20:55.483 --> 01:20:59.654
WERE BEFORE THEM AND- IT SEEMS

01:20:59.721 --> 01:21:00.288
TO ME THAT WE'RE PROBABLY TAKING

01:21:00.355 --> 01:21:05.760
AWAY. CHILDREN THAT. ARE IN

01:21:05.827 --> 01:21:08.230
REALLY POOR HOUSEHOLDS MORE THAN

01:21:08.296 --> 01:21:09.931
MORE THAN NOT NUMBER ONE AND

01:21:09.998 --> 01:21:10.999
NUMBER TWO THAT MANY OF THE

01:21:11.066 --> 01:21:13.201
TIMES IT'S THE POVERTY

01:21:13.268 --> 01:21:15.036
INDICATORS THAT WOULD INDICATE

01:21:15.103 --> 01:21:16.137
THE PARENTS ARE NOT DOING A VERY

01:21:16.204 --> 01:21:18.006
GOOD JOB OR THAT WOULD LEAD A

01:21:18.073 --> 01:21:20.909
JUDGE TO ISSUE OUT REMOVAL A

01:21:20.976 --> 01:21:24.145
OPPOSED TO- SOMETHING ELSE IN IN

01:21:24.212 --> 01:21:26.214
THE HOUSEHOLD IT'S HAPPENING AND

01:21:26.281 --> 01:21:30.452
SO. I JUST- I'M- VERY VERY

01:21:30.518 --> 01:21:31.486
CONCERNED THAT WE HAVE SOME

01:21:31.553 --> 01:21:32.887
PARAMETERS IN THIS AREA AND

01:21:32.954 --> 01:21:35.056
WHETHER WE LEGISLATED. OR WE

01:21:35.123 --> 01:21:36.891
DIRECT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO

01:21:36.958 --> 01:21:39.227

WORK WITH FAMILIES THROUGH. A

01:23:34.909 --> 01:23:36.911
DIFFERENT TIME. DIFFERENT TIME

01:23:36.978 --> 01:23:39.214
IF- AS A KIND OF MOVES FORWARD

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:41.583
FROM THEIR RELATIONSHIPS. WHICH

01:23:41.649 --> 01:23:42.884
WE ALSO HAVE A NON RESIDENTIAL

01:23:42.951 --> 01:23:45.019
PROGRAM OUT OF THE MAIN OFFICE.

01:23:45.086 --> 01:23:46.121
WHICH WE DO SUPPORT GROUPS AND

01:23:46.187 --> 01:23:48.990
INDIVIDUAL WORK AS WELL AND THE

01:23:49.057 --> 01:23:51.092
REALITY IS A LOT OF PEOPLE. YOU

01:23:51.159 --> 01:23:53.328
KNOW TV IS SO SUBJECTIVE

01:23:53.395 --> 01:23:54.529
DEPENDING ON THE FAMILY AND I

01:23:54.596 --> 01:23:56.231
EVERYBODY WANTS TO LEAVE THEIR

01:23:56.297 --> 01:23:59.134
PARTNER- SO WE DO GET A PRETTY

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:00.468
GOOD VARIETY OF DIFFERENT

01:24:00.535 --> 01:24:02.137
PRESENTING CHALLENGES AND SO

01:24:02.203 --> 01:24:04.072
I'VE LEARNED A LOT. JUST FROM

01:24:04.139 --> 01:24:06.408
BEING HERE- I DID MY INTERNSHIP

01:24:06.474 --> 01:24:08.643
HERE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. AND

01:24:08.710 --> 01:24:10.445
THEY HIRED ME AFTER SO IT'S

01:24:10.512 --> 01:24:14.549
BEEN. A VERY INSIGHTFUL JOURNEY

01:24:14.616 --> 01:24:15.483
. AND- LIKE I SAY I'M JUST

01:24:15.550 --> 01:24:17.218
THANKFUL TO BE HERE TODAY. BE

01:24:17.285 --> 01:24:18.686
ABLE TO TALK ABOUT SOME THINGS

01:24:18.753 --> 01:24:20.488
SO I KNOW THE GOLFER PANEL CHU

01:24:20.555 --> 01:24:23.525
IS IMPROVING OUTCOMES- SO THERE

01:24:23.591 --> 01:24:25.093
IS A GOOD AMOUNT OF PREVENTATIVE

01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:28.029
THINGS I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT-

01:24:28.096 --> 01:24:29.564
BECAUSE AGAIN WITH TV IT'S ONE

01:24:29.631 --> 01:24:30.999
OF THOSE SOCIAL ISSUES THAT IT

01:24:31.065 --> 01:24:32.333
IS VERY MUCH PRESENT. ARE

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:34.302
PREVENTABLE. LIKE BRIAN SAID

01:24:34.369 --> 01:24:35.570
THOUGH NOT YOU KNOW I EVEN

01:24:35.637 --> 01:24:36.871
EXPECTED TO GO AWAY COMPLETELY

01:24:36.938 --> 01:24:38.440
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT

01:24:38.506 --> 01:24:40.442
COULD BE DYING BEFORE FAMILIES

01:24:40.508 --> 01:24:41.443
HAVE TO COME INTO A PROGRAM LIKE

01:24:41.509 --> 01:24:45.046
OURS. OR YOU KNOW PEOPLE GROW UP

01:24:45.113 --> 01:24:46.915
WITNESSING TV THERE'S WORK THAT

01:24:46.981 --> 01:24:48.316
COULD BE DONE SO THAT THEY ALSO

01:24:48.383 --> 01:24:50.652
TURN INTO A PERPETRATOR. ALSO

01:24:50.718 --> 01:24:52.353
ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I WANTED

01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:52.887
TO TALK ABOUT WAS TRAUMA

01:24:52.954 --> 01:24:55.089
INFORMED CARE. AND SOME OF IT I

01:24:55.156 --> 01:24:56.724
THINK I'M SEEING IT RIGHT NOW IN

01:24:56.791 --> 01:25:00.462
OUR OWN AGENCY. IS BECAUSE- WE

01:25:00.528 --> 01:25:01.463
DO HAVE. I TURNED OVER A RIGHT

01:25:01.529 --> 01:25:02.964
NOW WE'RE GETTING TEAM MEMBERS

01:25:03.031 --> 01:25:06.000
AND AS THEY COME ON BOARD- THEY

01:25:06.067 --> 01:25:07.902
ALSO NEED TO BE TRAUMA INFORMED.

01:25:07.969 --> 01:25:09.003
BECAUSE THE TRAUMA INFORMED

01:25:09.070 --> 01:25:11.506
PERSON IS A SAFER PERSON. AND SO

01:25:11.573 --> 01:25:13.441
IT DOES ALWAYS MAKE ME WONDER

01:25:13.508 --> 01:25:16.077
YOU KNOW WHAT IS. THE STANDARD

01:25:16.144 --> 01:25:18.146
FOR TRAUMA INFORMED CARE. AND

01:25:18.213 --> 01:25:19.414
WHEN I STARTED RESEARCHING AND

01:25:19.481 --> 01:25:20.648
TO TRAUMA I WAS KIND OF

01:25:20.715 --> 01:25:22.484
SURPRISED THAT THERE'S NOT. SO

01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:24.819
MUCH OF A AGREED UPON DEFINITION

01:25:24.886 --> 01:25:26.554
OF WHAT TRAUMA IT IS AND I KNOW

01:25:26.621 --> 01:25:28.256
WE ALSO GOT INTO THAT TODAY.

01:25:28.323 --> 01:25:30.158
TALKING ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE-

01:25:30.225 --> 01:25:31.593
THERE'S NOT REALLY AN AGREED

01:25:31.659 --> 01:25:33.294
UPON DEFINITION OF WHAT THAT

01:25:33.361 --> 01:25:34.796
LOOKS LIKE. FOR GOOD REASON

01:25:34.863 --> 01:25:37.232
THAT'S SUBJECTIVE BUT- AS FAR AS

01:25:37.298 --> 01:25:38.466
TRAUMA INFORMED CARE GOES YOU

01:25:38.533 --> 01:25:39.567
KNOW WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT

01:25:39.634 --> 01:25:41.336
TRYING TO. RESIST RE

01:25:41.402 --> 01:25:43.471
TRAUMATIZING A FAMILY YOU KNOW

01:25:43.538 --> 01:25:45.206
THAT'S ALREADY LEAVING A TRAUMA.

01:25:45.273 --> 01:25:46.841
I DEFINITELY. DEFINITELY SEE THE

01:25:46.908 --> 01:25:48.610
IMPORTANCE OF TRAUMA INFORMED

01:25:48.676 --> 01:25:50.879
CARE. AND SO. YOU KNOW I'M

01:25:50.945 --> 01:25:52.380
THINKING ABOUT HOW YOU GET

01:25:52.447 --> 01:25:54.115
TRAINED AS A CLINICIAN SOMETIMES

01:25:54.182 --> 01:25:55.416
AN EDUCATOR OR A MEDICAL

01:25:55.483 --> 01:25:57.118
PROFESSIONAL. AND YOU LEARN

01:25:57.185 --> 01:25:58.987
ABOUT MANDATED REPORTING. AND

01:25:59.053 --> 01:26:00.355
IT'S NOT EVEN A QUESTION THAT

01:26:00.421 --> 01:26:01.489
YOU KNOW THOSE THINGS YOU NEED

01:26:01.556 --> 01:26:03.091
TO LISTEN FOR. WHAT YOU'RE GONNA

01:26:03.157 --> 01:26:04.425
CAUSE YOU TO HAVE TO AT LEAST

01:26:04.492 --> 01:26:07.028
CONSULT. RIGHT SO WHETHER IT'S-

01:26:07.095 --> 01:26:08.496
ARMED FOR SELF HARM TO OTHERS

01:26:08.563 --> 01:26:10.365
CHILD ABUSE ELDER ABUSE. IT'S

01:26:10.431 --> 01:26:13.001
VERY COMMON KNOWLEDGE. AND I

01:26:13.067 --> 01:26:14.335
WOULD HOPE TO SEE YOU GET TO

01:26:14.402 --> 01:26:15.503
THAT POINT WITH TRAUMA INFORMED

01:26:15.570 --> 01:26:18.873
CARE. WHERE WE ALL KNOW THE SIX.

01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:19.874
PRINCIPLES OF TRAUMA INFORMED

01:26:19.941 --> 01:26:22.577
CARE YOU KNOW- OR WHATEVER IS

01:26:22.644 --> 01:26:24.145
IT'S GOING TO BE LANGUAGE WISE I

01:26:24.212 --> 01:26:25.413
JUST FEEL LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF

01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:27.448
ROOM. FOR GROWTH AS FAR AS LIKE

01:26:27.515 --> 01:26:29.183
WHAT IS THE STANDARD. FOR TRAUMA

01:26:29.250 --> 01:26:31.185
INFORMED CARE OF BECAUSE LIKE I

01:26:31.252 --> 01:26:32.820
SAID NOT JUST OUR OWN AGENCY BUT

01:26:32.887 --> 01:26:34.155
FOR OTHER AGENCIES THAT ARE

01:26:34.222 --> 01:26:36.558
SERVING THESE FAMILIES- IF THERE

01:26:36.624 --> 01:26:37.926
IS A COMMON APPROACH TO WORKING

01:26:37.992 --> 01:26:38.960
WITH THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN

01:26:39.027 --> 01:26:40.395
EXPOSED TO TRAUMA. I THINK THAT

01:26:40.461 --> 01:26:41.930
COULD DEFINITELY IMPROVE.

01:26:41.996 --> 01:26:47.335
OUTCOMES. THE OTHER THING TO.

01:26:47.402 --> 01:26:49.103
THE FOLKS. TO IS ON CHILDREN.

01:26:49.170 --> 01:26:50.738
IS- AS GUYS OF OUR MET. YOU KNOW

01:26:50.805 --> 01:26:52.307
NOT JUST DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BUT

01:26:52.373 --> 01:26:54.108
TRAUMA IN GENERAL. IT COULD HAVE

01:26:54.175 --> 01:26:56.477
A VERY- COMMON RESPONSE AS FAR

01:26:56.544 --> 01:26:57.845
AS THE CHILD'S. SCHOOL

01:26:57.912 --> 01:26:59.581
PERFORMANCE AND FELT SOMETHING

01:26:59.647 --> 01:27:01.549
THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE HERE

01:27:01.616 --> 01:27:03.851
WITHIN OUR PROGRAM THAT WE DO.

01:27:03.918 --> 01:27:04.519
AND WE'RE CONNECTED TO SCHOOL ON

01:27:04.586 --> 01:27:07.155
WHEELS. AND I DO THINK I'VE SEEN

01:27:07.221 --> 01:27:09.390
BY INCREASED. BECAUSE OF COATED

01:27:09.457 --> 01:27:11.159
AND YOU KNOW A LOT OF STUDENTS

01:27:11.225 --> 01:27:12.994
HAD THEIR WITHDRAWAL BECAUSE OF

01:27:13.061 --> 01:27:15.330
THE VIRTUAL SET UP- BUT ON TOP

01:27:15.396 --> 01:27:16.431
OF THAT YOU KNOW WHEN THEY'RE

01:27:16.497 --> 01:27:18.266
EXPRIENCING TV IN THE HOME.

01:27:18.333 --> 01:27:20.401
THERE'S DEFINITELY THAT DROP IN

01:27:20.468 --> 01:27:22.170
SCHOOL PERFORMANCE. AND SO

01:27:22.236 --> 01:27:23.338
SCHOOL ON WHEELS IS A GREAT

01:27:23.404 --> 01:27:25.573
PROGRAM BECAUSE THEY'RE ABLE TO

01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:27.875
FOLLOW FAMILIES. IT'S A FANCY

01:27:27.942 --> 01:27:29.877
DESIGNED FOR HOMELESS. FAMILIES

01:27:29.944 --> 01:27:31.212
BUT A LOT OF IT THERE'S A HUGE

01:27:31.279 --> 01:27:33.147
OVERLAP. WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:27:33.214 --> 01:27:35.350
AND HOMELESSNESS- I KNOW THERE'S

01:27:35.416 --> 01:27:38.119
A PART WHERE. THE MAYOR'S- MERA

01:27:38.186 --> 01:27:40.588
REPORT WHERE IT WAS AROUND FORTY

01:27:40.655 --> 01:27:42.523
FOUR PERCENT. OF THEM SAID THAT

01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:43.858
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS A MAJOR

01:27:43.925 --> 01:27:45.593
CAUSE OF HOMELESSNESS. SO THERE

01:27:45.660 --> 01:27:47.128
IS A HUGE OVERLAP AND I REALLY

01:27:47.195 --> 01:27:48.229
LIKE THAT SCHOOL ON WHEELS

01:27:48.296 --> 01:27:50.531
FOCUSES ON THAT. AND I CAN LIKE

01:27:50.598 --> 01:27:52.000
I SAID THEY'RE ABLE TO FOLLOW

01:27:52.066 --> 01:27:53.334
FAMILIES AS THEY REBUILD THEIR

01:27:53.401 --> 01:27:54.969
INDEPENDENCE THEIR STABILITY.

01:27:55.036 --> 01:27:56.337
AND CELL AGAIN HELPING THE

01:27:56.404 --> 01:27:58.339
CHILDREN GET RE ENGAGED WITH

01:27:58.406 --> 01:27:59.307

01:27:59.374 --> 01:28:02.243
GOOD- WORK FOR OUR FAMILIES HERE

01:28:02.310 --> 01:28:03.878
IN OUR PROGRAM WHERE. THE

01:28:03.945 --> 01:28:05.446
CHILDREN DID COMING WITHDRAWN

01:28:05.513 --> 01:28:07.215
AND- LIKE I SAID NOT DOING TOO

01:28:07.281 --> 01:28:09.283
WELL IN SCHOOL- BUT THEY GET

01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:10.351
CONNECTED TO SCHOOL ON WHEELS

01:28:10.418 --> 01:28:12.387
AND THEY'RE ABLE TO. GET BACK

01:28:12.453 --> 01:28:13.855
INTO THE FLOW OF THEIR ACADEMICS

01:28:13.921 --> 01:28:15.923
AND MAKE A LOT OF PROGRESS. AND

01:28:15.990 --> 01:28:16.724
SO LIKE I SAID I KNOW THE

01:28:16.791 --> 01:28:18.226
SERVICE A LOT OF DIFFERENT-

01:28:18.292 --> 01:28:20.662

01:28:25.833 --> 01:28:27.568
STEP TO TRY TO HELP FAMILIES

01:28:27.635 --> 01:28:29.404
RECOVER. SARS PREVENTION AND

01:28:29.470 --> 01:28:31.072

CALLED COACHING BOYS INTO MEN-

01:28:48.022 --> 01:28:48.890
AS FAR AS PROVING. YOU KNOW THIS

01:28:48.956 --> 01:28:50.758
IS ONE OF THOSE. WHERE THE- IS

01:28:50.825 --> 01:28:52.393
TO. UTILIZE THE REALITY OF

01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:54.162
ATHLETES HAVE AN INFLUENCE ON

01:28:54.228 --> 01:28:56.197
THEIR CAMPUSES AND SO COACHING

01:28:56.264 --> 01:28:58.733

I SAID IT IS EVIDENCE BASED AND

01:29:08.042 --> 01:29:09.977
SO HAVE A LOT OF POTENTIAL AND

01:29:10.044 --> 01:29:11.512
WHEN WE'RE TALKING PREVENTION.

01:29:11.579 --> 01:29:13.014
YOU KNOW ONE OF THOSE ARE

01:29:13.081 --> 01:29:14.382
MULTIPLE OF THOSE PLAYERS ON

01:29:14.449 --> 01:29:15.683
THOSE TEAMS MIGHT BE LIVING IN A

01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:18.252
HOME. WITH T. V. BUT TO HEAR THE

01:29:18.319 --> 01:29:19.620
MESSAGE COMING FROM SOMEONE THEY

01:29:19.687 --> 01:29:21.155
LOOK UP TO LIKE THEIR COACH IT

01:29:21.222 --> 01:29:23.257
COULD TOTALLY. CHANGE THEIR

01:29:23.324 --> 01:29:24.992
DIRECTION OR THEIR TRAJECTORY.

01:29:25.059 --> 01:29:27.829
AS FAR AS BEING A PERPETRATOR

01:29:27.895 --> 01:29:29.464
THEMSELVES- SO I ACTUALLY JUST

01:29:29.530 --> 01:29:31.399
GOT TO. DO A FIRST TRYING TO

01:29:31.466 --> 01:29:32.734
INSTALL THAT TRAINING FOR THE

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:34.635
CITY OF AS YOU SAW LAST WEEK. SO

01:29:34.702 --> 01:29:36.170
I WAS ABLE TO SIT WITH THIRTEEN

01:29:36.237 --> 01:29:38.539
STAFFERS AND EXPLAIN TO THEM

01:29:38.606 --> 01:29:40.341
WHAT COACHING BOYS INTO MEN.

01:29:40.408 --> 01:29:42.176
ENTAILS AND KIND OF COME UP WITH

01:29:42.243 --> 01:29:43.444
A PLAN ON HOW WE'RE GOING TO

01:29:43.511 --> 01:29:45.079
MOVE FORWARD AND ROLL IT OUT.

01:29:45.146 --> 01:29:46.414
WHETHER IT'S THROUGH THE CITY OF

01:29:46.481 --> 01:29:48.549
ITS USE- SCHOOL DISTRICTS OR

01:29:48.616 --> 01:29:49.617
MAYBE IT'S JUST DO THEIR

01:29:49.684 --> 01:29:51.018
COMMUNITY PROGRAM BUT THAT'S

01:29:51.085 --> 01:29:52.653
ANOTHER GREAT. PREVENTATIVE

01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:55.256
EFFORT I ALSO HAD A REALLY GOOD

01:29:55.323 --> 01:29:56.290
DISCUSSION LAST WEEK WITH THE

01:29:56.357 --> 01:29:57.692
COUNCILMAN. SHE'S OUT OF SAN

01:29:57.759 --> 01:29:59.393
BERNARDINO COUNTY AND THIS JUST

01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:02.430
TO KIND OF TOUCH ON THE BALL

01:30:02.497 --> 01:30:02.864
YOU'RE TO PROTECT.

01:30:02.930 --> 01:30:03.965
CONVERSATIONAL BEEN HAVING

01:30:04.031 --> 01:30:05.767
TODAY. THAT I HAVE SEEN IT A LOT

01:30:05.833 --> 01:30:07.368
YOU KNOW WHERE OU'RE GOING AND

01:30:07.435 --> 01:30:08.102
FAMILIES THAT COME INTO OUR

01:30:08.169 --> 01:30:10.004
SHELTER. UNFORTUNATELY BILL

01:30:10.071 --> 01:30:10.905
STILL HAVE THEIR CHILDREN

01:30:10.972 --> 01:30:12.907
REMOVED- WHILE THE INVESTIGATION

01:30:12.974 --> 01:30:15.443
IS ONGOING. AND THANKFULLY I'VE

01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:17.044
SEEN A LOT OF CHILDREN RETURNED

01:30:17.111 --> 01:30:18.646
TO THEIR FAMILY. BUT THE POINT

01:30:18.713 --> 01:30:20.114
IS THEY WERE SEPARATED FOR THOSE

01:30:20.181 --> 01:30:21.449
MONTHS AS THEY DID THEIR

01:30:21.516 --> 01:30:23.050
INVESTIGATION. AND I'VE EVEN

01:30:23.117 --> 01:30:24.619
UNFORTUNATELY SCENE WHERE THE

01:30:24.685 --> 01:30:27.221
CHILDREN GET SENT TO ABUSER. AND

01:30:27.288 --> 01:30:28.756
SO. I AM TALKING ABOUT THE

01:30:28.823 --> 01:30:30.424
TRAUMA DOES TO NOT ONLY THE

01:30:30.491 --> 01:30:32.093
CHILDREN BUT ALSO THE PARENT THE

01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:34.061
NON OFFENDING PARENT- THERE'S A

01:30:34.128 --> 01:30:35.663
LOT OF ROOM FOR GROWTH. AND SO

01:30:35.730 --> 01:30:37.398
THIS COUNCIL I MEAN YOU KNOW HER

01:30:37.465 --> 01:30:39.167
VISION AND I KNOW IT'S A FAR OFF

01:30:39.233 --> 01:30:40.601
VISION AS FAR AS HOW LONG IT'LL

01:30:40.668 --> 01:30:42.537
TAKETO COMPLETE BUT- SHE

01:30:42.603 --> 01:30:44.272
ENVISIONED THE FACILITY

01:30:44.338 --> 01:30:45.473
SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR THOSE

01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:47.041
FAMILIES. YOU KNOW WHERE THERE

01:30:47.108 --> 01:30:48.943
DOES NEED TO BE ABOUT MONITORING

01:30:49.010 --> 01:30:50.178
BUT INSTEAD OF SEPARATING THE

01:30:50.244 --> 01:30:52.246
FAMILY THEY ALL GO INTO THIS

01:30:52.313 --> 01:30:54.415
PROGRAM. AND LIKE I SAID WE'VE

01:30:54.482 --> 01:30:56.184
HAD CLIENTS COME INTO OUR

01:30:56.250 --> 01:30:57.819
PROGRAM WHERE. THAT'S WHAT THEY

01:30:57.885 --> 01:30:59.153
WERE TOLD YOU KNOW IF YOU DON'T

01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:01.489
GO INTO THE SHELTER YOUR

01:31:01.556 --> 01:31:02.790
CHILDREN WILL BE REMOVED. AND SO

01:31:02.857 --> 01:31:04.358
THEY COMPLY. THEY COME TO THE

01:31:04.425 --> 01:31:05.927
SHELTER AND SOMEHOW THEY STILL

01:31:05.993 --> 01:31:06.861
END UP HAVING THE CHILDREN

01:31:06.928 --> 01:31:08.462
REMOVED. SO I THINK HAVING A

01:31:08.529 --> 01:31:10.298
FACILITY SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED

01:31:10.364 --> 01:31:12.466
FOR THOSE. TYPES OF FAMILIES

01:31:12.533 --> 01:31:13.234
WHERE THERE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:31:13.301 --> 01:31:15.269
SEVERE. I HAVE A NEED TO KEEP

01:31:15.336 --> 01:31:17.271
THE MONITOR IT- THAT WOULD BE

01:31:17.338 --> 01:31:18.339
GREAT YOU KNOW SO AGAIN WE CAN

01:31:18.406 --> 01:31:19.740
DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF TIME

01:31:19.807 --> 01:31:21.709
HOURS SEPARATING CHILDREN. FROM

01:31:21.776 --> 01:31:23.911
NOT SUPPORTIVE PARENT. IN

01:31:23.978 --> 01:31:25.046
SOMETHING ELSE YOU KNOW THAT I'M

01:31:25.112 --> 01:31:27.048
ALSO HOPING TO SEE HAPPEN HERE

01:31:27.114 --> 01:31:30.184
IN CALIFORNIA. IS OUT OF OHIO.

01:31:30.251 --> 01:31:31.886
THEY ARE WORKING RIGHT NOW AND

01:31:31.953 --> 01:31:33.988
TRY TO TRYING TO ESTABLISH A

01:31:34.055 --> 01:31:35.923
BILL ONLINE. A STATE OF

01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:37.959
EMERGENCY ON CHILDHOOD TRAUMA.

01:31:38.025 --> 01:31:39.260
AND ESSENTIALLY IT'S TAKING THE

01:31:39.327 --> 01:31:40.661
MODEL OF WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE

01:31:40.728 --> 01:31:43.164
OPIOID EPIDEMIC. WHERE THERE WAS

01:31:43.231 --> 01:31:44.498
DECLARED ON A STATE LEVEL AND

01:31:44.565 --> 01:31:45.766
THEN OF COURSE BACK THEN

01:31:45.833 --> 01:31:47.401
PRESIDENT TRUMP. WAS ABLE TO DO

01:31:47.468 --> 01:31:49.103
THAT ON A FEDERAL LEVEL WHICH

01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:51.072
DOES CREATE. A LOT MORE ACCESS

01:31:51.138 --> 01:31:53.507
TO- JUST DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES

01:31:53.574 --> 01:31:55.142
TO AGAIN HELP. AND I KNOW THAT'S

01:31:55.209 --> 01:31:56.143
SOMETHING THAT'S COME UP TODAY

01:31:56.210 --> 01:31:57.979
IS THE PSYCHO EDUCATION AROUND

01:31:58.045 --> 01:32:00.348
TRAUMA. AND ESPECIALLY THE CYCLE

01:32:00.414 --> 01:32:01.582
EDUCATION AROUND DOMESTIC

01:32:01.649 --> 01:32:03.584
VIOLENCE. SO BEING ABLE TO

01:32:03.651 --> 01:32:05.052
DECLARE TATE OF EMERGENCY ON

01:32:05.119 --> 01:32:06.120
CHILDHOOD TRAUMA I THINK WOULD

01:32:06.187 --> 01:32:07.788
HELP. YOU KNOW THE MESSAGE

01:32:07.855 --> 01:32:09.056
REALLY GET OUT THERE THAT IT'S

01:32:09.123 --> 01:32:11.559
VERY PRETTY BASES. AND I CANNOT

01:32:11.626 --> 01:32:12.827
LIVE A LOT OF THE WORK OUT OF

01:32:12.894 --> 01:32:14.028
CALIFORNIA I THINK IT IS REALLY

01:32:14.095 --> 01:32:15.229
PROGRESSIVE I THINK OUR FIRST

01:32:15.296 --> 01:32:16.964
SPEAKER SURE ABOUT TODAY. YOU

01:32:17.031 --> 01:32:18.099
KNOW THAT WE DO HAVE A LOT OF

01:32:18.165 --> 01:32:20.668
GREAT WORK BEING DONE- BUT I

01:32:20.735 --> 01:32:21.435
THINK THERE'S ALSO THE

01:32:21.502 --> 01:32:23.137
OPPORTUNITY THERE THAT IF WE DID

01:32:23.204 --> 01:32:24.138
SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN OTHER

01:32:24.205 --> 01:32:26.274
STATES. WOULD FOLLOW SUIT AND SO

01:32:26.340 --> 01:32:27.508
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT. YOU KNOW

01:32:27.575 --> 01:32:29.911
THE ASU STUDY. AND WHAT WE KNOW

01:32:29.977 --> 01:32:31.612
ABOUT CHILDHOOD ADVERSITY AND

01:32:31.679 --> 01:32:33.314
HOW THAT SHOWS UP ON THE ADULT

01:32:33.381 --> 01:32:35.149
SIDE OF LIFE- THERE'S A LOT OF

01:32:35.216 --> 01:32:36.884
GREAT MOTIVATION AND REASONS WHY

01:32:36.951 --> 01:32:37.785
WE WOULD WANT TO DO SOMETHING

01:32:37.852 --> 01:32:39.687
LIKE THIS. WHETHER IT IS JUST TO

01:32:39.754 --> 01:32:41.923
KIND OF INCREASE. THE AWARENESS

01:32:41.989 --> 01:32:43.925
OF THE CYCLE EDUCATION. BUT ALSO

01:32:43.991 --> 01:32:45.493
LIKE I SAID SURPRISE POTENTIALLY

01:32:45.559 --> 01:32:47.461
ACCESS FUNDS SO THAT. WE CAN

01:32:47.528 --> 01:32:49.263
CONNECT MORE FAMILIES TO THE

01:32:49.330 --> 01:32:51.365
SERVICES THAT THEY NEED- SO

01:32:51.432 --> 01:32:53.067
HOPEFULLY YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID A

01:32:53.134 --> 01:32:54.035

01:33:29.303 --> 01:33:32.540
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES OF- IS A

01:33:32.606 --> 01:33:33.174
LOT OF TIMES IT'S REALLY HARD TO

01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:35.142
FIGURE OUT. EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING

01:33:35.209 --> 01:33:36.143
ON IN THE FAMILY WITH THE

01:33:36.210 --> 01:33:38.145
DYNAMICS ARE AND THERE WEREN'T

01:33:38.212 --> 01:33:39.380
ANY INJURIES IT JUST PUSHING AND

01:33:39.447 --> 01:33:40.715
EVERYBODY. ENDED UP GETTING

01:33:40.781 --> 01:33:43.784
ARRESTED IN. AND I ALWAYS

01:33:43.851 --> 01:33:45.987
RECOMMENDED THAT DURING THE TIME

01:33:46.053 --> 01:33:48.723
THAT WE COULD DO IT- THAT IT MAY

01:33:48.789 --> 01:33:51.492
BE- EVERYBODY BE DIVERTED AND

01:33:51.559 --> 01:33:53.127
PUTTING IT INTO A PROGRAM

01:33:53.194 --> 01:33:53.728
TOGETHER SO THAT THEY COULD

01:33:53.794 --> 01:33:55.663
START WORKING OUT. WHATEVER THE

01:33:55.730 --> 01:33:57.231
ISSUES WERE THEY THAT THEY HAD

01:33:57.298 --> 01:33:58.599
BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO BE

01:33:58.666 --> 01:33:59.667
TOGETHER AND THEY CAME IN

01:33:59.734 --> 01:34:01.135
TOGETHER AND THEY WOULD COME IN

01:34:01.202 --> 01:34:03.337
TOGETHER AND SO THIS WHOLE IDEA

01:34:03.404 --> 01:34:05.106
THAT THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE.

01:34:05.172 --> 01:34:06.574
PEOPLE JUST NEED TO LEARN HOW TO

01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:09.410
COMMUNICATE BETTER AND HOW TO-

01:34:09.477 --> 01:34:11.345
HELP HAVE A GOOD EXPRESSED ITS

01:34:11.412 --> 01:34:12.179
APPOINTMENT I MEAN IF THERE'S

01:34:12.246 --> 01:34:14.648
ONE PLACE. THAT YOU'RE LIKELY TO

01:34:14.715 --> 01:34:18.052
BE DISAPPOINTED MAD OR- FEELING

01:34:18.119 --> 01:34:20.388
SAD IS AN EMERITUS AND OR IN A

01:34:20.454 --> 01:34:21.956
RELATIONSHIP AND IF YOU CAN

01:34:22.023 --> 01:34:23.357
LEARN HOW TO EXPRESS YOURSELF

01:34:23.424 --> 01:34:24.191
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT SO

01:34:24.258 --> 01:34:26.460
THESE. THESE KINDS OF THINGS

01:34:26.527 --> 01:34:29.030
THESE PROGRAMS ARE REALLY- GIVE

01:34:29.096 --> 01:34:30.898
ME HOPE THAT THERE'S- A WAY TO

01:34:30.965 --> 01:34:33.134
BE ABLE TO HELP PROBABLY A

01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:34.902
MAJORITY OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT

01:34:34.969 --> 01:34:37.705
ARE ARE- ARE EXPERIENCING THIS

01:34:37.772 --> 01:34:40.641
KIND OF STRESS AND TO BE ABLE TO

01:34:40.708 --> 01:34:41.275
LEARN HOW TO COMMUNICATE BETTER

01:34:41.342 --> 01:34:42.510
. WITH THEMSELVES AND WITH THEIR

01:34:42.576 --> 01:34:45.312

REVIEW AND- THANK YOU- JONATHAN

01:34:56.323 --> 01:35:00.127
FOR THAT TESTIMONY- WHAT WHAT I

01:35:00.194 --> 01:35:04.098
WAS STRUCK BY IS JUST THAT. HOW

01:35:04.165 --> 01:35:05.599
MUCH MORE WE'RE UNDERSTANDING

01:35:05.666 --> 01:35:08.736
THAT. BOTH THE PERPETRATOR OF

01:35:08.803 --> 01:35:11.439
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND THE VICTIM

01:35:11.505 --> 01:35:14.508
THERE PAST TRAUMA CONTRIBUTED TO

01:35:14.575 --> 01:35:15.676
THERE BEING IN THE CIRCUMSTANCE

01:35:15.743 --> 01:35:18.012
THE RENT TO THE VICTIMS STAYING

01:35:18.079 --> 01:35:20.548
IN THAT SITUATION BUT OF COURSE

01:35:20.614 --> 01:35:21.148
THERE'S MANY OTHER COMPLICATED

01:35:21.215 --> 01:35:26.120
FACTORS- BUT ALSO THE D. D.

01:35:26.187 --> 01:35:26.887
PERPETRATOR BECAUSE THE

01:35:26.954 --> 01:35:28.956
PERPETRATOR IT'S ENOUGH WHERE

01:35:29.023 --> 01:35:30.224
IT'S ALL POWER DYNAMICS AND

01:35:30.291 --> 01:35:32.526
IT'S- LIKE MAKING UP FOR A LACK

01:35:32.593 --> 01:35:34.662
OF POWER THEY FEEL. THEY FEEL IN

01:35:34.728 --> 01:35:38.099
THEIR OWN LIVES. AND THAT. WE

01:35:38.165 --> 01:35:40.601
OUR CARCERAL SYSTEM WHETHER G.

01:35:40.668 --> 01:35:42.670
OR PRISONS ARE IS REALLY STILL

01:35:42.736 --> 01:35:44.905
NOT DESIGNED TO DEAL WITH TRAUMA

01:35:44.972 --> 01:35:49.510
AND SO WHILE CLEARLY- WE HAVE.

01:35:49.577 --> 01:35:52.279
YOU KNOW PENAL CODE STATUTES AND

01:35:52.346 --> 01:35:54.582
SUCH DEAL THIS. IT DOESN'T

01:35:54.648 --> 01:35:55.516
NECESSARILY GET AT THE

01:35:55.583 --> 01:35:58.219
UNDERLYING NOW FOR SOME PEOPLE I

01:35:58.285 --> 01:36:00.554
THINK IT ABSOLUTELY MUST BE

01:36:00.621 --> 01:36:04.258
THERE. WITH THE CAR SERRATION IS

01:36:04.325 --> 01:36:07.461
A NECESSARY HOWEVER FOR MANY IT

01:36:07.528 --> 01:36:09.763
IT MAY JUST REALLY BE MORE THAT

01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:12.500
TRAUMA INFORMED CARE. AND IN

01:36:12.566 --> 01:36:15.302
SOME CASES MAYBE NOT TOGETHER IN

01:36:15.369 --> 01:36:17.271
OTHER CASES PERHAPS TOGETHER

01:36:17.338 --> 01:36:19.940
MEETING WITH THE TWO PEOPLE OR

01:36:20.007 --> 01:36:21.609
FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY. BUT

01:36:21.675 --> 01:36:23.344
OBVIOUSLY THE IMPACT ON THE

01:36:23.410 --> 01:36:25.146
CHILDREN IS MORE TRAUMA IN

01:36:25.212 --> 01:36:27.214
TRAUMA THAT THEN CAN PLAY OUT

01:36:27.281 --> 01:36:29.150
LATER IN THEIR LIVES SO. THE

01:36:29.216 --> 01:36:31.752
MORE WE CAN FOCUS THIS WHERE

01:36:31.819 --> 01:36:34.355
APPROPRIATE ON TRAUMA INFORMED

01:36:34.421 --> 01:36:36.490
CARE THE BETTER AND YET WE ARE

01:36:36.557 --> 01:36:39.593
WOEFULLY INADEQUATE IN PROVIDING

01:36:39.660 --> 01:36:42.062
RESOURCES FOR SUCH CARE AND HAVE

01:36:42.129 --> 01:36:44.899
STILL PRIMARILY RELIED ON THE

01:36:44.965 --> 01:36:47.801
CARCERAL SYSTEM SO. AGAIN ANY OF

01:36:47.868 --> 01:36:49.803
OUR PANELISTS SUGGESTIONS ON HOW

01:36:49.870 --> 01:36:52.573
WE CAN DO THAT BETTER- CLEARLY

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:54.074
BUDGET IS ONE ISSUE BUT IT'S

01:36:54.141 --> 01:36:58.746
THERE'S OTHER FACTORS. TOO WE

01:36:58.812 --> 01:37:00.147
WELCOME THEM. THANK YOU FOR YOUR

01:37:00.214 --> 01:37:01.849

WE'RE MANDATED REPORTERS. BUT

01:37:13.527 --> 01:37:15.963
IT'S THE ASSUMPTION THAT WE ALL

01:37:16.030 --> 01:37:17.331
KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR AND

01:37:17.398 --> 01:37:19.366
UNDERSTAND WHAT TO REPORT SO I

01:37:19.433 --> 01:37:21.902
THINK MAYBE EXPLORING SPECIFIC

01:37:21.969 --> 01:37:24.004
EXAMPLES AND GUIDELINES FOR

01:37:24.071 --> 01:37:25.272

THINGS AND PERHAPS WE WILL NOT

01:37:30.411 --> 01:37:32.079
RECOGNIZE IT IF WE'VE NEVER BEEN

01:41:21.742 --> 01:41:25.479
CHILDREN. I SHARE THAT STORY.

01:41:25.546 --> 01:41:27.448
CAUSE OF DEATH ROW THE NICE THE

01:41:27.514 --> 01:41:30.284
BAY AREA COMMUNITY AND ALSO

01:41:30.350 --> 01:41:32.953
FEATURES SHOWED US WHY DESPITE

01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:37.124
SOME OF OUR LAWS IN THE BOOKS

01:41:37.191 --> 01:41:40.194
THINGS CONTINUED TO FAIL US. AND

01:41:40.260 --> 01:41:42.296
WE WERE ASKED A DISPENSER CAN

01:41:42.362 --> 01:41:44.565
PANEL TO SHARE HOW WE CAN

01:41:44.631 --> 01:41:46.900
IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN

01:41:46.967 --> 01:41:49.002
VICTIMS AND FAMILIES. I THINK

01:41:49.069 --> 01:41:51.071
THE VERY FIRST PROBLEM AND MANY

01:41:51.138 --> 01:41:52.706
HAVE BEEN I'VE SPOKEN TO THIS

01:41:52.773 --> 01:41:55.008
ALREADY BUT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT

01:41:55.075 --> 01:41:56.043
IT THAT CHILD VICTIMS OF

01:41:56.109 --> 01:41:58.812
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. NOT ONLY S.

01:41:58.879 --> 01:42:01.448
WITNESSES BUT DIRECTLY INJURED

01:42:01.515 --> 01:42:03.250
ARE NOT PROTECTED IN FAMILY

01:42:03.317 --> 01:42:06.086
COURT. NATIONAL RESEARCH BY

01:42:06.153 --> 01:42:08.722
GERALDINE STALEY PHD FOUND THAT

01:42:08.789 --> 01:42:11.758
OVER 85% OF CALIFORNIA MOTHERS

01:42:11.825 --> 01:42:14.027
WHO CAME TO COURT. TO PROTECT

01:42:14.094 --> 01:42:15.362
THEIR CHILDREN LOST PRIMARY

01:42:15.429 --> 01:42:18.398
CUSTODY. THE IDENTIFIED ABUSIVE

01:42:18.465 --> 01:42:22.236
PARENTS LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS

01:42:22.302 --> 01:42:24.872
SOCIAL WORKERS MEDIATORS CUSTODY

01:42:24.938 --> 01:42:27.107
EVALUATORS ATTORNEYS FOR THE

01:42:27.174 --> 01:42:30.043
CHILDREN AND JUDGES MINIMIZED

01:42:30.110 --> 01:42:31.378
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND CHILD

01:42:31.445 --> 01:42:34.948
ABUSE GIVING THE EXCUSE AND SOME

01:42:35.015 --> 01:42:39.386
CONVICTED FATHERS UNSUPERVISED

01:42:39.453 --> 01:42:41.688
ACCESS TO CHILDREN. THAT MUST

01:42:41.755 --> 01:42:46.560
STOP 73% OF CALIFORNIA CHILDREN

01:42:46.627 --> 01:42:48.862
REPORTED THAT THEY WERE RE

01:42:48.929 --> 01:42:50.197
INJURED AND SOME HAVE BEEN

01:42:50.264 --> 01:42:53.800
KILLED. THESE FINDINGS REPLICATE

01:42:53.867 --> 01:42:56.970
OTHER NATIONAL STUDIES. ARMED

01:42:57.037 --> 01:42:58.338
WITH CALIFORNIA PROTECTIVE

01:42:58.405 --> 01:43:00.974
PARENTS JUST- ON A NATIONAL A

01:43:01.041 --> 01:43:03.744
STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION AND GOT A

01:43:03.810 --> 01:43:05.679
CENTER FOR JUDICIAL EXCELLENCE

01:43:05.746 --> 01:43:08.282
ALSO HAS A U. S. DIVORCE

01:43:08.348 --> 01:43:11.184
HOMICIDE CHILD HOMICIDES THAT IS

01:43:11.251 --> 01:43:13.220
ON THEIR WEBSITES. I THINK THE

01:43:13.287 --> 01:43:15.889
SECOND ISSUE THAT I HAVE ALREADY

01:43:15.956 --> 01:43:17.891
BEEN ALLUDED TO EARLIER BUT I

01:43:17.958 --> 01:43:19.526
WANT TO GIVE CREDENCE TO SOME OF

01:43:19.593 --> 01:43:20.727
THE TRAININGS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:43:20.794 --> 01:43:22.596
DEVELOPED OVER THE YEARS. IS

01:43:22.663 --> 01:43:24.197
THAT THERE IS ANY NEED FOR

01:43:24.264 --> 01:43:26.400
STANDARDIZED AND SPECIALIZED

01:43:26.466 --> 01:43:28.535
TRAINING BY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:43:28.602 --> 01:43:30.837
AND CHILD ABUSE SPECIALISTS FOR

01:43:30.904 --> 01:43:33.540
ALL COURT OFFICIALS NOT JUST FOR

01:43:33.607 --> 01:43:37.177
JUDGE THIS. THE NATIONAL COUNCIL

01:43:37.244 --> 01:43:38.145
ON JUVENILE AND FAMILY COURT

01:43:38.211 --> 01:43:40.013
JUDGES DOES AN AMAZING

01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:43.483
CONFERENCE EVERY YEAR AND ALSO-

01:43:43.550 --> 01:43:45.419
PROVIDES TRAININGS DOMESTIC

01:43:45.485 --> 01:43:48.622
VIOLENCE EXPERTS AND ADVOCATES

01:43:48.689 --> 01:43:50.524
THAT ALL NEED TO WORK TOGETHER.

01:43:50.591 --> 01:43:52.859
SO AT THE STATE LEVEL IF WE

01:43:52.926 --> 01:43:54.661
COULD HAVE THOSE STANDARDIZED

01:43:54.728 --> 01:43:57.397
TRAINING CONDUCTED. BY DOMESTIC

01:43:57.464 --> 01:43:59.099

01:43:59.166 --> 01:44:01.201
SPECIALIST FOR ALL COURT

01:44:01.268 --> 01:44:04.871
OFFICIALS WOULD REALLY HELP. WE

01:44:04.938 --> 01:44:07.441
WILL BE PRESENTING FEW TO

01:44:07.507 --> 01:44:09.443
SPECIFIC LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS

01:44:09.509 --> 01:44:12.112
WHICH I WON'T. GO INTO IT BUT

01:44:12.179 --> 01:44:14.881
JUST BRIEFLY MENTION OUR FIRST

01:44:14.948 --> 01:44:16.750
RECOMMENDATION IS BECAUSE OF THE

01:44:16.817 --> 01:44:19.219
ISSUE THE ISSUE BEING VICTIMS OF

01:44:19.286 --> 01:44:21.421
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ARE ENDANGERED

01:44:21.488 --> 01:44:22.222
AND INTIMIDATED IN FAMILY

01:44:22.289 --> 01:44:24.625
COURTS. VICTIMS ARE COERCED INTO

01:44:24.691 --> 01:44:26.393
MEDIATING WITH ABUSERS FACE TO

01:44:26.460 --> 01:44:29.596
FACE DESPITE RULE OF COURT FIVE

01:44:29.663 --> 01:44:31.565
POINT TWO ONE FIVE. VICTIMS ARE

01:44:31.632 --> 01:44:33.567
NOT GIVEN TIME TO LEAVE COURT

01:44:33.634 --> 01:44:36.703
ROOMS BEFORE ABUSERS. EVEN WHEN

01:44:36.770 --> 01:44:38.472
THEY HAVE A RESTRAINING ORDER.

01:44:38.538 --> 01:44:40.073
VICTIMS ARE ORDERED TO MAKE

01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:41.575
CUSTODY EXCHANGES WITHOUT

01:44:41.642 --> 01:44:44.211
PROTECTION EVEN WHEN THEY HAVE A

01:44:44.277 --> 01:44:46.446
RESTRAINING ORDER. OUR PROPOSED

01:44:46.513 --> 01:44:48.949
SOLUTION IS TO AMEND PENAL CODE

01:44:49.016 --> 01:44:51.118
SECTION TWO SIX FOUR POINT TWO

01:44:51.184 --> 01:44:55.922
AND FINALLY COLD. SECTION THREE

01:44:55.989 --> 01:44:57.858
ONE EIGHT ONE. THAT WILL BE

01:44:57.924 --> 01:45:00.594
SUBMITTED TO YOU IN WRITING- BUT

01:45:00.661 --> 01:45:01.962
I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT WHY THAT'S

01:45:02.029 --> 01:45:04.598
IMPORTANT OUR COALITION OF

01:45:04.665 --> 01:45:07.000
ADVOCATES FIRST A PARTY'S

01:45:07.067 --> 01:45:08.568
REQUEST FOR SEPARATE SESSIONS IS

01:45:08.635 --> 01:45:10.504
NOT EVIDENCE OF HIS OR HER LACK

01:45:10.570 --> 01:45:12.639
OF COOPERATION WITH THE PROCESS

01:45:12.706 --> 01:45:15.142
WE WILL HIGHLIGHT THAT IN THE

01:45:15.208 --> 01:45:15.709
LANGUAGE CHANGE THAT WE WILL

01:45:15.776 --> 01:45:18.345
PROPOSE. SECOND IF DOMESTIC

01:45:18.412 --> 01:45:20.180
VIOLENCE IS DISCOVERED AFTER

01:45:20.247 --> 01:45:22.182

SEPARATELY ABOUT SAFETY RELATED

01:45:27.587 --> 01:45:29.589
ISSUES. AND THE OPTION OF

01:45:29.656 --> 01:45:31.725
CONTINUING IN SEPARATE SESSIONS

01:45:31.792 --> 01:45:33.894
AT SEPARATE TIMES THESE

01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:36.229
INCREASING INCREASES SAFETY

01:45:36.296 --> 01:45:39.066
FACTORS. THIRD THE

01:45:39.132 --> 01:45:41.001
CONFIDENTIALITY OF EACH PARTY

01:45:41.068 --> 01:45:44.337
STEIN'S ARRIVAL DEPARTURE AND

01:45:44.404 --> 01:45:47.074
MEETING SHALL BE PROTECTED. AND

01:45:47.140 --> 01:45:49.443
FOURTH ANY PARTY WHO REQUESTED

01:45:49.509 --> 01:45:51.578
SEPARATE MEDIATION SESSIONS DUE

01:45:51.645 --> 01:45:53.480
TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHALL BE

01:45:53.547 --> 01:45:56.116
ASKED TO LEAVE THE COURT FIFTEEN

01:45:56.183 --> 01:45:57.684
MINUTES BEFORE THE ACCUSED

01:45:57.751 --> 01:46:00.120
OFFENDER IF THEY MUST APPEAR

01:46:00.187 --> 01:46:03.824
TOGETHER IN PERSON FOR A HEARING

01:46:03.890 --> 01:46:05.892
. OUR SECOND RECOMMENDATION WILL

01:46:05.959 --> 01:46:09.096
POINT OUT TO A LEGISLATIVE FIX

01:46:09.162 --> 01:46:12.566
IN EVIDENCE CODE SEVEN THIRTY.

01:46:12.632 --> 01:46:14.568
WHEN FAMILIES HAVE RESOURCES.

01:46:14.634 --> 01:46:16.770
FAMILY COURTS FREQUENTLY APPOINT

01:46:16.837 --> 01:46:19.606
PRIVATE CUSTODY EVALUATORS UNDER

01:46:19.673 --> 01:46:21.374
EVIDENCE CODE SEVEN THIRTY THE

01:46:21.441 --> 01:46:23.610
COURT THE COURT RARELY PAYS FOR

01:46:23.677 --> 01:46:25.312
THE EVALUATION EVEN THOUGH THE

01:46:25.378 --> 01:46:26.947
APPOINTMENT IS FOR THE COURTS

01:46:27.013 --> 01:46:29.116
NEEDS. THIS ADDRESSES WHAT

01:46:29.182 --> 01:46:31.251
SENATOR COUPLE GYRO HAS THAT NOT

01:46:31.318 --> 01:46:35.122
EVERY FAMILY ENTERS THE COURT IN

01:46:35.188 --> 01:46:36.389
THE SAME WAY. PARENTS ARE

01:46:36.456 --> 01:46:38.225
REQUIRED TO PAY THE UNREGULATED

01:46:38.291 --> 01:46:40.694
AND OFTEN COSTLY FEES DIRECTLY

01:46:40.761 --> 01:46:42.662
TO WITH THE EVALUATOR. THE

01:46:42.729 --> 01:46:43.897
PARENTS THEN WITH THE MOST

01:46:43.964 --> 01:46:47.501
RESOURCES MAY PAY MORE OR ALL OF

01:46:47.567 --> 01:46:50.370
THE FEES THEREBY RAISING

01:46:50.437 --> 01:46:52.739
CONCERNS OF IMMEDIATE POSSIBLE

01:46:52.806 --> 01:46:55.475
BIAS. THIS DOES NOT OCCUR IN

01:46:55.542 --> 01:46:57.677
CRIMINAL AND JUVENILE COURTS.

01:46:57.744 --> 01:46:59.813
THESE AMENDMENTS WOULD ENSURE

01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:01.481
THAT COMPENSATION FOR A PRIVATE

01:47:01.548 --> 01:47:03.750
CUSTODY EVALUATION IS MADE BY

01:47:03.817 --> 01:47:05.685
THE COURT NOT THE LITIGANTS SO

01:47:05.752 --> 01:47:07.454
WE WILL PRESENT TO USE SPECIFIC

01:47:07.521 --> 01:47:10.157
LANGUAGE AMENDING CODES.

01:47:10.223 --> 01:47:13.527
EVIDENCE CODE SEVEN THIRTY AND

01:47:13.593 --> 01:47:15.996
SEVEN THIRTY ONE. I ADDITIONAL

01:47:16.062 --> 01:47:20.400
STATE LEVEL- IDEAS THAT WE'D

01:47:20.467 --> 01:47:23.003
LIKE TO PROPOSE IS THAT.

01:47:23.069 --> 01:47:25.105
MEDIATORS AND EVALUATORS NEED TO

01:47:25.172 --> 01:47:26.373
DO IN DANGER ASSESSMENTS FOR

01:47:26.439 --> 01:47:29.142
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DEFENSE RYAN I

01:47:29.209 --> 01:47:31.478
BELIEVE HIM I'M TALK ABOUT THIS

01:47:31.545 --> 01:47:33.313
A LITTLE BIT HOW DO WE SCALE AND

01:47:33.380 --> 01:47:35.015
REACH ASSESS THE LEVEL OF

01:47:35.081 --> 01:47:38.752
DANGER. AND SO WE NEED TO BE

01:47:38.819 --> 01:47:39.886
ABLE TO DO THOSE DANGER

01:47:39.953 --> 01:47:41.354
ASSESSMENTS FOR DOMESTIC

01:47:41.421 --> 01:47:44.391
VIOLENCE VICTIMS. AGAIN DOMESTIC

01:47:44.457 --> 01:47:45.592
VIOLENCE VICTIMS SHOULD NEVER

01:47:45.659 --> 01:47:47.460
HAVE TO BE MEDIATE FACE TO FACE

01:47:47.527 --> 01:47:51.331
WITH THEIR ABUSERS. OR LEAVE THE

01:47:51.398 --> 01:47:52.399
COURT AT THE SAME TIME. AT LEAST

01:47:52.465 --> 01:47:53.934
DANGEROUS AND INTIMIDATING

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:55.635
OUTCOMES HAPPEN FREQUENTLY IN

01:47:55.702 --> 01:47:58.839
COURT. ALL FAMILY COURT

01:47:58.905 --> 01:48:01.541
PROCEEDINGS HEARINGS NEED TO BE

01:48:01.608 --> 01:48:03.610
RECORDED BY EITHER A COURT

01:48:03.677 --> 01:48:05.846
REPORTER ARE ELECTRONICALLY MORE

01:48:05.912 --> 01:48:07.781
AND MORE SOME COURTS ARE DOING

01:48:07.848 --> 01:48:10.150
THIS IN DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS

01:48:10.217 --> 01:48:12.786
BECAUSE IT REQUIRES ADDITIONAL

01:48:12.853 --> 01:48:14.888
FUNDING FROM THE ON THE COUNTY

01:48:14.955 --> 01:48:20.493
OR THE STATE. ANOTHER IDEA IS-

01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:22.395
ANY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM WHO

01:48:22.462 --> 01:48:24.231
WAS SELF REPRESENTED WHILE THE

01:48:24.297 --> 01:48:26.166
BATTER HAS AN ATTORNEY SHOULD

01:48:26.233 --> 01:48:28.201
RECEIVE A PRO BONO ATTORNEY OR

01:48:28.268 --> 01:48:30.904
HAVE AN ATTORNEY PAID BY THE

01:48:30.971 --> 01:48:33.440
OTHER PARTY AS REQUIRED. AND

01:48:33.506 --> 01:48:36.109
THEN A THIRD ANOTHER THING IS

01:48:36.176 --> 01:48:38.144
THE RECENT LEGISLATION WHICH

01:48:38.211 --> 01:48:41.648
THAT WAS A B. ELEVEN SIXTY NINE

01:48:41.715 --> 01:48:46.019
BY ASSEMBLYWOMAN BLANCA RUBIO-

01:48:46.086 --> 01:48:47.888
REQUIRES A FORM FOR CORD

01:48:47.954 --> 01:48:49.522
CONNECTED PROFESSIONALS TO

01:48:49.589 --> 01:48:51.591
FOLLOW THE PROPER PROTOCOL FOR

01:48:51.658 --> 01:48:53.760
INVESTIGATING CHILD ABUSE CASES

01:48:53.827 --> 01:48:55.495
AND BRING FACTS AND EVIDENCE TO

01:48:55.562 --> 01:48:57.464
THE COURT BUT MORE WORK IS

01:48:57.530 --> 01:48:59.532
NEEDED TO ENSURE THE FORM IS

01:48:59.599 --> 01:49:03.169
PROPERLY UTILIZED. OUR ADVOCATES

01:49:03.236 --> 01:49:06.072
HAD TRIED FOR OVER FIFTEEN YEARS

01:49:06.139 --> 01:49:07.641
TO GET A FORM TO IMPLEMENT

01:49:07.707 --> 01:49:11.211
ANALLY CODE. THIRTY ONE EIGHTEEN

01:49:11.278 --> 01:49:12.345
IT TOOK THE HORRIBLE DEATH OF

01:49:12.412 --> 01:49:14.447
LITTLE PC AND HIS MOTHER ANA

01:49:14.514 --> 01:49:17.017
ESTEVEZ ADVOCACY AND

01:49:17.083 --> 01:49:19.552
ASSEMBLYWOMAN RUBIO STRONG

01:49:19.619 --> 01:49:21.488
ADVOCACY. BUT THIS THE COURT

01:49:21.554 --> 01:49:23.690
STILL USE EVIDENCE CODE SEVEN

01:49:23.757 --> 01:49:24.925
THIRTY EACH APPOINT EXPENSIVE

01:49:24.991 --> 01:49:27.160
PSYCHOLOGIST TO DO MENTAL HEALTH

01:49:27.227 --> 01:49:28.395
TESTING WHEN THERE ARE

01:49:28.461 --> 01:49:30.497
ALLEGATIONS OF CHILD ABUSE

01:49:30.563 --> 01:49:32.499
SPECIALLY CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE.

01:49:32.565 --> 01:49:35.335
THIS NEVER TURNS OUT WELL FOR

01:49:35.402 --> 01:49:37.170
ADULT AND CHILD VICTIMS BUT THE

01:49:37.237 --> 01:49:38.905
COURT MAKES THE PARENTS STAYED

01:49:38.972 --> 01:49:40.974
UP PROFESSIONAL DIRECTLY SO IT

01:49:41.041 --> 01:49:44.344
ONLY APPLIES WHEN ONE PARENT HAS

01:49:44.411 --> 01:49:46.046
LOTS OF RESOURCES. WE ARE ALSO

VIOLENCE. AND WE- WE KNOW THAT

02:13:09.514 --> 02:13:12.684
IN THAT THAT'S THE CASE AND- YOU

02:13:12.751 --> 02:13:14.653
KNOW MANY OF MOST OTHER

02:13:14.720 --> 02:13:16.755
EVERYWHERE ELSE IN THE STATE. SO

02:13:16.822 --> 02:13:20.258
THE QUESTION OF HOW WE IN IN

02:13:20.325 --> 02:13:24.629
CALIFORNIA IS VERY ORIENTED.

02:13:24.696 --> 02:13:27.332
TOWARDS COUNTY- COUNTY SPECIFIC

02:13:27.399 --> 02:13:29.768
PROGRAMS IN ALL THESE AREAS OUR

02:13:29.835 --> 02:13:31.136
IT'S OUR COUNTY OUR SOCIAL

02:13:31.203 --> 02:13:33.205
WORKERS ARE COUNTY WORKERS OUR

02:13:33.271 --> 02:13:35.140
COURTS ARE IN EFFECT COUNTY

02:13:35.207 --> 02:13:37.309
COURTS AND EVEN THOUGH WE SET

02:13:37.376 --> 02:13:39.711
STATEWIDE POLICY IT'S VERY MUCH

02:13:39.778 --> 02:13:42.214
UP TO THE COUNTIES TO DELIVER

02:13:42.280 --> 02:13:44.116
AND SO FOR EXAMPLE IT IS

02:13:44.182 --> 02:13:46.284
COMPLETELY AVAILABLE TO ANY

02:13:46.351 --> 02:13:48.920
COUNTY TO SET UP THE TYPE OF

02:13:48.987 --> 02:13:50.489
PROGRAM LIKE IN NEBRASKA WHERE

02:13:50.555 --> 02:13:52.090
THEY HAVE A DEPENDENCY COURT%

02:13:52.157 --> 02:13:54.426
WHERE THEY UTILIZED THE SOCIAL

02:13:54.493 --> 02:13:58.363

02:13:58.430 --> 02:14:01.166
INTEGRATE ALL ALL OF THE-

02:14:01.233 --> 02:14:02.734
SYSTEMS AND MAKE A VERY FOCUSED

02:14:02.801 --> 02:14:04.469
ON DEMAND. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IT

02:14:04.536 --> 02:14:06.405
IS AVAILABLE NOT ALL OF OUR

02:14:06.471 --> 02:14:08.039
COUNTIES TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT

02:14:08.106 --> 02:14:10.876
WHETHER WE HAVE TO PROVIDE SOME

02:14:10.942 --> 02:14:13.512
MORE INCENTIVE OR I THINK THOSE

02:14:13.578 --> 02:14:15.447
ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO

02:14:15.514 --> 02:14:19.651
CONSIDER AND- AND OBVIOUSLY WE

02:14:19.718 --> 02:14:21.720
HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE

02:14:21.787 --> 02:14:23.989
INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF

02:14:24.055 --> 02:14:26.258
TRAUMA INFORMED CARE. FOR BOTH

02:14:26.324 --> 02:14:30.061
PERPETRATORS AND- AND VICTIMS

02:14:30.128 --> 02:14:31.163
BUT OF COURSE ESPECIALLY THE

02:14:31.229 --> 02:14:32.431
VICTIMS AND THEIR CHILDREN TO

02:14:32.497 --> 02:14:34.099
MAKE SURE THAT THE VICTIMS AND

02:14:34.166 --> 02:14:35.567
THE CHILDREN ARE NOT PUNISHED

02:14:35.634 --> 02:14:37.769
FOR BEING IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE

02:14:37.836 --> 02:14:38.937
BUT I THINK THOSE ARE VERY

02:14:39.004 --> 02:14:42.340
IMPORTANT BECAUSE- D. D.

02:14:42.407 --> 02:14:44.843
CARCERAL ASPECT ALONE WILL NOT

02:14:44.910 --> 02:14:47.145
SOLVE THIS SO I REALLY I REALLY

02:14:47.212 --> 02:14:49.014
APPRECIATE ALL THE TESTIMONY AND

02:14:49.080 --> 02:14:51.183

IN DETAIL WITH MY STAFF AND THEN

02:14:57.856 --> 02:14:58.423

I. OPENING CASES THAT WERE

02:15:12.537 --> 02:15:15.373
SHARED- AND I THINK THAT- THE

02:15:15.440 --> 02:15:17.375
OVER ARCHING I WOULD SEE THEME

02:15:17.442 --> 02:15:20.378

02:15:26.418 --> 02:15:27.719
THINGS THAT COUNTIES COULD

02:15:27.786 --> 02:15:29.120

THAT IT'S BEING UTILIZED

CORRECTLY- BUT LASTLY I WILL

02:16:51.369 --> 02:16:53.038

HEARD BY ONE OF THE PANELISTS

02:17:07.886 --> 02:17:09.521
AND I GUESS IT'S TRYING TO BRING

02:17:09.588 --> 02:17:11.456
THAT BALANCE BETWEEN. LEAVING A

02:17:11.523 --> 02:17:13.391
CHILD IN A VICTIM IN A HOME

SHARED AND THAT HE IS SOMETIMES

02:17:21.299 --> 02:17:22.867
THERE IS THAT THIS OVER REACTION

02:17:22.934 --> 02:17:24.369

02:17:24.436 --> 02:17:27.272
FAMILIES- WHEN SOMETHING CAN BE

02:17:27.339 --> 02:17:28.440
