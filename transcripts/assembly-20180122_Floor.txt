AS SOME PEOPLE TWELVE FORTY EIGHT BY SOMETHING NUMBER GLORIA AND ACTUALLY THE PEOPLE'S. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA. NO SPEAKER I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT AB TWELVE FORTY EIGHT. THIS IS THE REINTRODUCTION OF AB TWO THIRTY THREE THAT PAT S. HOUSE ON A SEVENTY THREE TO ONE VOTE. AB TWELVE FORTY EIGHT PROTECT THE STUDENT'S RIGHT TO WEAR CULTURAL ADORNMENTS AT GRADUATION CEREMONIES. IN RECENT YEARS SCHOOL BOARDS HAVE ENFORCED A NO ADORNMENT POLICY THAT PROHIBITS STUDENTS FROM WEARING CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE. ADORNMENTS AT THEIR SICK GRADUATION CEREMONIES FOR EXAMPLE NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENTS ARE ROUTINELY PREVENT IT FROM WEARING EAGLE FEATHERS. WHICH SYMBOLIZE PERSONAL ACHIEVEMENT IN ONE'S OWN PASSAGE INTO ADULTHOOD. THESE INCIDENTS REVEAL THAT NO ADORNMENT POLICIES PREVENT STUDENTS FROM RECOGNIZING THEIR CULTURAL HERITAGE WHILE CELEBRATING THIS SIGNIFICANT PERSONAL MILESTONE. NOW SPEAKER CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE STATE COMPRISED OF STUDENTS OF VARIOUS ETHNIC RELIGIOUS AND CULTURAL BACKGROUNDS. BY PROTECTING A PUPILS RIGHT TO WEAR CULTURE ENVIRONMENT. MEMBERS PLEASE GIVE MR GLORIA YOUR FULL ATTENTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU MAN SPEAKER. BY PROTECTING THE PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO WEAR CULTURAL ADORNMENTS AT COMMENCEMENT AB TWELVE FORTY ENHANCES THE DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S ACADEMIC INSTITUTION. TO ADDRESS THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE I INTEND TO ONCE AGAIN SAT DOWN WITH THE OPPOSITION TO NEGOTIATE LANGUAGE THAT APPROPRIATELY BOUNCES STUDENTS RIGHTS TO FREE EXPRESSION WITH THE SCHOOLS RIGHTS TO PREVENT DISRUPTION FROM GRADUATION CEREMONIES. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THEY DO NOT A SPEAKER. THANK YOU MISTER HARPER YOU'RE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. GRADUATION CEREMONIES MARK THE CULMINATION OF ACADEMIC SUCCESS IT IS ALSO A TIME FOR THE LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCY GOVERNING BOARD TO DETERMINE THE FOCUS OF THE CEREMONIES ON ACADEMIC HONORS AND ACHIEVEMENT. I AM A HUGE PROPONENT OF LOCAL CONTROL AND FREEDOM OF SPEECH WHILE THE AUTHOR MAY ALLUDE TO IT THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT FREEDOM OF SPEECH. IN FACT THE U. S. CONSTITUTION ALREADY PROTECT THE FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGION INCLUDING WEARING RELIGIOUS ARTICLES BY STUDENTS. IN FACT THIS BILL IS IDENTICAL TO AB TWO THIRTY THREE OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN AS THE AUTHOR STATED WHICH MADE IT THROUGH BOTH HOUSES BUT WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR. BECAUSE OF THESE PROTECTIONS ALREADY EXISTS. MADAM SPEAKER PERMISSION TO READ FROM THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE. WITHOUT OBJECTION. STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE A WELL ESTABLISHED. RIGHT TO EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS THROUGH SYMBOLIC ACTS UNDER THE STATE EDUCATION CODE AND THE FREE CLIP SPEECH CLAUSE OF THE FIRST A MEMBER OF THE U. S. CONSTITUTION. UNDER THESE PRECEDENTS STUDENT EXPRESSION IS CLEARLY PROTECTED TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS A DISPUTE. ABOUT WHAT A STUDENT CAN WEAR AT SCHOOL GRADUATION CEREMONIES I BELIEVE THAT THOSE CLOSEST. TO THE PROBLEM. PRINCIPALS AND DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED SCHOOL BOARDS ARE IN THE BEST POSITION TO MAKE WISE JUDGMENTS. MEMBERS I'M NOT OPPOSED TO THE CONCEPT OF THIS BILL. IN FACT IDEA HAPPY TO. VOTE FOR SIMILAR KIND OF CONCEPT IF I WAS STILL A MEMBER THE HUNTINGTON BEACH UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT BOARD OF TRUSTEES BUT I CANNOT VOTE FOR THIS BILL TODAY THE WAY IT READS. IT IS LIKELY A RESULT THAT NUMEROUS LAWSUITS ADMINISTRATORS SEEK TO MAINTAIN DIGNITY AT GRADUATION CEREMONIES BY ALLOWING SOMEONE DORMANT ADORNMENTS. WHILE RESTRICTING OTHERS FOR EXAMPLE. MANY AMERICANS MAY REGARD A CONFEDERATE FLAG AS A SYMBOL OF RACISM. WHILE OTHERS MAY VIEW IT AS A SYMBOL OF SOUTHERN HERITAGE AND MAY ABUSE THIS LAW IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE THAT OR MORE INFLAMMATORY SYMBOLS AND A GRADUATION CEREMONY. WELL THAT MAY BE CULTURAL TO SOME MAY NOT BE OFFENSIVE TO OTHERS AND WILL DISTRACT FROM WHAT'S THE STUDENTS. PARENTS AND ACADEMIA ARE THERE TO ACTUALLY CELEBRATE THE AT THE CONCLUSION OF THEIR GRADUATION. LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCY GOVERNMENT BOARDS SCHOOL BOARDS SHOULD BE THE ONES TO ENSURE THE FOCUS OF THE CEREMONIES IS ON ACADEMIC HONORS AND ACHIEVEMENT. NOT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MY COLLEAGUES I THINK THAT THIS CAN BE SOLVED BY OUR LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS. AS AND I THINK THE GOVERNOR HAS AN EXCELLENT POINT IS VETO MESSAGE I URGE A VOTE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. THANK YOU MISTER GLORIA WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I WOULD NOT A SPEAKER AND I THINK MY COLLEAGUE OF MINE TO BEACH FIRST COMMENTS I MENTIONED EARLIER MY COMMENTS AT THIS PREVIOUSLY PASSED THE HOUSE A SEVENTY THREE TO ONE A LEADER TO GUESS WHO THE ONE WAS. A WHO VOTED OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. IT WAS STATED THAT THIS BILL DOES IS AYE IS REDUNDANT TO EXISTING LAW. BUT I WOULD TELL YOU THAT YOU SHOULD ASK THE STUDENTS FROM PECHANGA. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHO DIDN'T WHO ARE NOT ALLOWED TO WEAR EAGLE FEATHERS AT THEIR GRADUATION ASK THEM IF THE LAW IS CLEAR ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO WEAR CULTURAL ADORNMENTS AT GRADUATION CEREMONIES ASKED THE YOUNG MAN JUST DOWN THE ROAD EL GROWTH. WHO'S DENIED CULTURAL A IT WOULD THE ABILITY TO WEAR HIS CAN TAKE OFF AT HIS GRADUATION CEREMONY I HAVE THE UTMOST RESPECT FOR OUR GOVERNOR BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT IS INVOLVED IN EVERY ONE OF OUR SCHOOLS. THIS HAPPENS REGULARLY AND IT DESERVES CLARIFICATION BY THIS BODY THAT THE STUDENTS ARE ENTITLED TO FREE EXPRESSION WITH THE CAVIAR OF NOT BEING DISRUPTIVE AND I WOULD SIMPLY SAY THIS IS ABOUT CULTURAL ADORNMENTS THIS IS NOT ABOUT POLITICAL. OR OTHER THERE IS A REFERENCE TO CONFEDERATE FLAG FOR WHICH I DON'T BELIEVE I CAN TAKE CLOTH AN EAGLE FEATHER. IOMEGA ANY THESE OTHER THINGS THAT WE SEE CURRENTLY IN SO MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS. IS. WOULD NOT BE WOULD WE BE PERMITTED IT WOULD NOT BE PERMITTED THE IDEA IS TO CLARIFY THE LAW TO ALLOW STUDENTS TO ENJOY THEIR GRADUATION CEREMONIES WITHOUT LITIGATION I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT EVERY MEMBER OF THIS BODY CAN SUPPORT. WHO WANTS SEVERAL LAWSUITS WE SHOULDN'T DO THAT YOU VOTED FOR THIS PREVIOUSLY PLEASE VOTE TO PASS THIS BILL AND I APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUES SUPPORT? THANK YOU MISTER GLORIA MADAM CLERK PLEASE OPEN THE RIGHT. ALL MEMBERS VOTE WHO DESIRE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTE WHO DESIRE TO VOTE MADAM CLERK YOU MAY CLOSE THE ROLE A TALLY THE VOTES.
