BOARD MENTIONED- THE TIMELINE

00:09:16.155 --> 00:09:17.356
SHIFTED FROM WHERE WE THOUGHT

00:09:17.423 --> 00:09:18.524
THE TIME LINE WAS WHEN THE

00:09:18.591 --> 00:09:20.393

THE PROGRAM AND NONE OF THIS

00:09:37.076 --> 00:09:38.911

OF. THE SENATORS I HAVE A

00:10:04.837 --> 00:10:06.439
QUESTION ON THIS IS THAT THIS

IS A BILL THAT WAS PASSED IN

00:10:08.574 --> 00:10:09.875

CENTER CAMEL OWNER THANK YOU SO

00:10:22.922 --> 00:10:25.291
MUCH CHAIRWOMAN- YOU KNOW I HAD

00:10:25.358 --> 00:10:27.093
ACTUALLY A QUESTION FOR- THE

00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:29.028
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. FOR THE

00:10:29.095 --> 00:10:30.696
MEDICAL BOARD BECAUSE I'VE ALSO

00:10:30.763 --> 00:10:32.365

00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:34.967
RELATED TO COST MANAGEMENT- AND

00:10:35.034 --> 00:10:36.736
SO JUST WANTED TO KNOW IF HE

00:10:36.802 --> 00:10:39.505
COULD MAYBE- WELL I THINK FOLKS

00:10:39.572 --> 00:10:41.407
HAVE QUESTIONS AROUND SORT OF-

00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:44.210
FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY- COST

00:10:44.276 --> 00:10:45.344
MANAGEMENT TOOK AROUND

EXPENDITURES- I KNOW THIS IS

00:10:47.646 --> 00:10:50.616

MORE REVENUES FROM THE STATE I

00:10:55.554 --> 00:10:56.622
THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT FOR

00:10:56.689 --> 00:10:59.125
FOLKS TO KNOW THAT THAT MONEY

00:10:59.191 --> 00:11:00.092

WAS ASKING FOR YES ELL I MEAN

00:11:15.541 --> 00:11:16.609
I GUESS THERE ARE TWO SEPARATE

00:11:16.675 --> 00:11:18.477
ISSUES HERE ONE IS THE QUESTION

00:11:18.544 --> 00:11:19.945
OF THE COST MANAGEMENT OF THE

00:11:20.012 --> 00:11:21.680
MEXICO PILOT PROJECT AND IF

00:11:21.747 --> 00:11:23.749
THERE ANY SPECIFIC ISSUES OR

00:11:23.816 --> 00:11:25.518
QUERIES ABOUT HOW THOSE NUMBERS

00:11:25.584 --> 00:11:27.520
WERE ARRIVED AT OUR TO THE

00:11:27.586 --> 00:11:29.288
MANAGEMENT OF THOSE FUNDS OF

00:11:29.355 --> 00:11:31.290
COURSE WE WOULD BE VERY HAPPY

00:11:31.357 --> 00:11:33.259
TO ADDRESS THOSE SPECIFICALLY.

00:11:33.325 --> 00:11:34.794
AND WE HAVE THE PEOPLE HERE WHO

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.463
ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE DETAILS

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.665
OF THE PROJECT IF THE QUESTION

00:11:39.732 --> 00:11:42.168
IS ONE ABOUT COST MANAGEMENT IN

00:11:42.234 --> 00:11:44.537
RELATION TO OUR FUND INCREASED

00:11:44.603 --> 00:11:45.805
WHICH OF COURSE IS A MUCH

00:11:45.871 --> 00:11:47.973
LARGER QUESTION I WOULD BE VERY

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.775
HAPPY TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES

00:11:49.842 --> 00:11:52.111
MYSELF I JUST ON THAT SECOND

00:11:52.178 --> 00:11:54.346
POINT YES WE ARE LOOKING FOR

00:11:54.413 --> 00:11:56.382
THE FEE INCREASE A FEE INCREASE

00:11:56.449 --> 00:11:58.784
WE HAVE NOT HAD FOR MANY YEARS

00:11:58.851 --> 00:12:00.686
I BELIEVE IT'S FOURTEEN YEARS

00:12:00.753 --> 00:12:02.188
DURING THAT TIME A LOT OF OUR

00:12:02.254 --> 00:12:04.557
COSTS HAD INCREASED. AND OF

00:12:04.623 --> 00:12:07.026
COURSE 80% OF ALL OF OUR WORK

00:12:07.093 --> 00:12:09.662
IN TERMS OF RESOURCES AND TIME

00:12:09.728 --> 00:12:11.464
IS RELATED TO ENFORCEMENT SO

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:12.932
WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN THE IN THE

00:12:12.998 --> 00:12:14.200
BOUT THE YEAR THAT I HAVE BEEN

00:12:14.266 --> 00:12:16.502
HERE IS THAT WE HAVE FOCUSED

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:19.305
OUR ENERGY ON TRYING TO MORE

00:12:19.371 --> 00:12:21.707
EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY

00:12:21.774 --> 00:12:25.978
MANAGE OUR LARGE PROGRAM OF

00:12:26.045 --> 00:12:28.547
CASE MANAGEMENT- WE ARE GETTING

00:12:28.614 --> 00:12:31.217
IN ON THE ORDER OF ELEVEN

00:12:31.283 --> 00:12:31.717
THOUSAND TWELVE THOUSAND

00:12:31.784 --> 00:12:33.419
COMPLAINTS PER YEAR. SOME OF

00:12:33.486 --> 00:12:35.554
THOSE CASES ARE EXTREMELY

00:12:35.621 --> 00:12:38.224
SERIOUS AND REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:39.859
AMOUNT OF RESOURCES WHAT WE

00:12:39.925 --> 00:12:41.894
WANT TO DO IS TO TRIAGE THE

00:12:41.961 --> 00:12:43.762
CASES AND MANAGE THEM PROPERLY

00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:45.097
SO THE ONES THAT ARE LESS

00:12:45.164 --> 00:12:47.133
SERIOUS WE CAN DEAL WITH MUCH

00:12:47.199 --> 00:12:48.000
MORE EFFICIENTLY AND

00:12:48.067 --> 00:12:49.869
EFFECTIVELY DURING THE TENURE

00:12:49.935 --> 00:12:51.437
THAT I HAVE BEEN IN JUST IN THE

00:12:51.504 --> 00:12:53.472
PAST SIX MONTHS WE'VE REDUCED

00:12:53.539 --> 00:12:55.508
THE TOTAL CASES UNDER

00:12:55.574 --> 00:12:57.710
MANAGEMENT ACTIVE MANAGEMENT.

00:12:57.776 --> 00:13:00.346
ON THE ORDER OF 13% WHICH IS A

00:13:00.412 --> 00:13:03.349
VERY SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENT A

00:13:03.415 --> 00:13:05.618
LOT OF OUR ENFORCEMENT COSTS

00:13:05.684 --> 00:13:06.385
ARE NOT UNDER OUR DIRECT

00:13:06.452 --> 00:13:08.921
CONTROL. WE OUTSOURCED TO THE

00:13:08.988 --> 00:13:10.689
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND%

00:13:10.756 --> 00:13:11.557
THE HEALTH QUALITY

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:14.093
INVESTIGATIVE UNIT. WHO MANAGE

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.896
THEM FOR US AND THAT'S REALLY

00:13:16.962 --> 00:13:19.198
THE COST IS BASED ON TIME SO

00:13:19.265 --> 00:13:19.999
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS

00:13:20.065 --> 00:13:22.501
BUILD UP OUR- CAPABILITIES

00:13:22.568 --> 00:13:24.570
INTERNALLY. ARE MORE

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:27.039
EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE CASES

00:13:27.106 --> 00:13:29.275
DEAL WITH THE EASIER CASES

00:13:29.341 --> 00:13:31.544
SIMPLY IN MORE EFFECTIVELY

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:33.679
WE'RE WE'RE SEEING THAT HAPPEN.

00:13:33.746 --> 00:13:36.015
OUR NET FISCAL POSITION HAS

00:13:36.081 --> 00:13:38.450
IMPROVED FROM WHERE IT WAS IN

00:13:38.517 --> 00:13:41.020
JANUARY OF LAST YEAR. BUT IT

00:13:41.086 --> 00:13:43.055
STILL REQUIRES THE NEED FOR A

00:13:43.122 --> 00:13:45.724
FEE INCREASE BUT I CAN. ASSURE

00:13:45.791 --> 00:13:46.992
EVERYONE HERE WE'RE DOING

00:13:47.059 --> 00:13:49.495
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ACTIVELY

00:13:49.562 --> 00:13:52.298
MANAGE OUR RESOURCES WHILE AT

00:13:52.364 --> 00:13:53.933
THE SAME TIME PRESERVING

00:13:53.999 --> 00:13:55.701
RESOURCES FOR THOSE MOST

00:13:55.768 --> 00:13:57.803
SERIOUS CASES AND I THINK OUR

00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:59.672
NUMBERS DEMONSTRATE. THAT WE'RE

00:13:59.738 --> 00:14:01.173
HEADING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.608
WE'RE NOT SIMPLY LOOKING FOR A

00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:05.077
BLANK CHECK WE REALIZED THAT WE

00:14:05.144 --> 00:14:06.912
HAVE TO MANAGE OUR RESOURCES.

00:14:06.979 --> 00:14:09.114
VERY EFFECTIVELY AND WE BELIEVE

00:14:09.181 --> 00:14:10.516
WITH THE REDUCTION OF TOTAL

00:14:10.583 --> 00:14:12.418
CASES UNDER MANAGEMENT THAT

00:14:12.484 --> 00:14:13.185
THAT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT

00:14:13.252 --> 00:14:14.753
DIRECTION. NOW IF YOU HAVE

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.755

SERVICES THEY NEED SO THERE ARE

00:28:56.835 --> 00:28:58.336
SYSTEMS THAT REQUIRE A VERY

00:28:58.403 --> 00:29:00.805
DEEP LEVEL. OF AUTHENTICATION

00:29:00.872 --> 00:29:02.207
TO GUARANTEE THAT A PERSON IS

UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE MIGHT BE

00:29:08.813 --> 00:29:09.881
AN EASY EXAMPLE. THERE ARE

00:29:09.948 --> 00:29:10.782
OTHER SYSTEMS THAT DON'T

00:29:10.849 --> 00:29:12.584
REQUIRE NEARLY THAT LEVEL OF

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:14.385
AUTHENTICATION. AND WHAT WE'RE

00:29:14.452 --> 00:29:16.221
PROPOSING IS A IS THE ABILITY

00:29:16.287 --> 00:29:17.889
TO RIGHT SIZE THAT SORT OF WORK

00:29:17.956 --> 00:29:19.424
ASKING THE APPROPRIATE

00:29:19.491 --> 00:29:21.025

00:29:24.028 --> 00:29:26.764
ONLY AVAILABLE TO THEM AND IN

00:29:26.831 --> 00:29:29.300
FACT. WE WILL. DESTROY THE

00:29:29.367 --> 00:29:30.869

00:29:30.935 --> 00:29:33.838
NO LONGER NECESSARY. FOR US FOR

00:29:33.905 --> 00:29:36.307
TO BE MAINTAINED AND ASK FOR

00:29:36.374 --> 00:29:36.875
THEM TO HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE

00:29:36.941 --> 00:29:39.777
ACCOUNTS. SO AS WE MOVE FORWARD

00:29:39.844 --> 00:29:41.112
WHAT WE PLAN TO DO IS A PROOF

00:29:41.179 --> 00:29:43.214
OF CONCEPT THAN A PILOT WITH

00:29:43.281 --> 00:29:45.116
TWO DEPARTMENTS AT THE END OF

00:29:45.183 --> 00:29:46.618
THAT PILOT WOULD BRING BACK AN

FORWARD IN A SUBSEQUENT REQUEST

00:29:52.524 --> 00:29:54.359
BEFORE WE MOVE ANY FARTHER INTO

00:29:54.425 --> 00:29:56.327
DEPLOYMENT ACROSS THE STATE SO

00:29:56.394 --> 00:29:59.197
IT IS. A VERY IN DEPTH PLANNING

00:29:59.264 --> 00:30:00.832
PROCESS WHERE WE ABSOLUTELY

00:30:00.899 --> 00:30:02.367
PLAN TO BRING IN STAKEHOLDERS

00:30:02.433 --> 00:30:03.735
TO GATHER REQUIREMENTS GATHER

00:30:03.801 --> 00:30:06.704
THE CONCERNS THAT NEED TO BE

00:30:42.674 --> 00:30:44.709
ANALYSIS OF THIS PROPOSAL- WE

00:30:44.776 --> 00:30:46.177
RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE

00:30:46.244 --> 00:30:47.612
REJECT THIS BUDGET REQUEST AS

00:30:47.679 --> 00:30:49.747
PROPOSED. AGAIN WITHOUT%

00:30:49.814 --> 00:30:51.316
PREJUDICE TO THE POLICY MERITS

OF THE PROPOSAL WE ACKNOWLEDGE

00:30:52.517 --> 00:30:53.685
THE BENEFITS THAT THE

00:30:53.751 --> 00:30:56.020
ADMINISTRATION HAS PUT FORWARD-

00:30:56.087 --> 00:30:57.622
ONE POINT OF CLARIFICATION FROM

00:30:57.689 --> 00:31:00.058
OUR ANALYSIS. CDC HAS APPROVED

00:31:00.124 --> 00:31:01.960

ALONGSIDE A POTENTIAL

00:31:08.299 --> 00:31:09.467
DELEGATION REQUEST FOR THE

00:31:09.534 --> 00:31:10.969
PROJECT. SO WE HAVE NOT

00:31:11.035 --> 00:31:12.503
RECEIVED THAT DOCUMENTATION AND

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:14.839
OUR CONCLUSION- REMAINS OF THE

00:31:14.906 --> 00:31:15.907
LEGISLATURE DOES NOT HAVE THE

00:31:15.974 --> 00:31:17.175
INFORMATION NEEDS TO FULLY

ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH-

00:31:27.785 --> 00:31:31.256
I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS-

00:31:31.322 --> 00:31:32.857
TO START OFF WHAT IS THE WHAT

00:31:32.924 --> 00:31:34.859
WHAT CRITERIA ARE YOU USING TO

00:31:34.926 --> 00:31:37.562
DETERMINE WHICH DEPARTMENTS

00:31:37.629 --> 00:31:38.129
WOULD BE PART OF THIS PILOT

00:31:38.196 --> 00:31:41.432
PRO. JECT THE INITIAL PHASE OF

00:31:41.499 --> 00:31:42.800
THIS PLANNING EFFORT IS TO

00:31:42.867 --> 00:31:44.435
DETERMINE EXACTLY THAT IN OTHER

00:31:44.502 --> 00:31:45.436
WORDS WE'VE NOT REFINED THE

00:31:45.503 --> 00:31:47.839
EXACT CRITERIA HOWEVER BECAUSE

00:31:47.905 --> 00:31:50.108
IT IS EIGHTY EIGHT PILOTING A

00:31:50.174 --> 00:31:52.810
PROOF OF CONCEPT. WE WILL NOT

00:31:52.877 --> 00:31:56.047
BE USING SYSTEMS THAT CONTAIN.

00:31:56.114 --> 00:31:56.914
A CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

00:31:56.981 --> 00:31:58.349
STRUCTURE WHERE HEALTHCARE

00:31:58.416 --> 00:31:59.851
INFORMATION OR ANYTHING

00:31:59.917 --> 00:32:01.919
EXTREMELY CONFIDENTIAL WHEN WE

00:32:01.986 --> 00:32:03.254
GET TO THE PILOT WE WANT

00:32:03.321 --> 00:32:06.090
REPRESENTATIVE SYSTEMS THAT CAN

00:32:06.157 --> 00:32:07.158
SHOW THE RESIDENTS OF

00:32:07.225 --> 00:32:09.827
CALIFORNIA AND THE DIFFERENCES

00:32:09.894 --> 00:32:11.562
ARE THAT THEY REFLECT IN

00:32:11.629 --> 00:32:14.432
CULTURAL DYNAMICS FOR. LANGUAGE

00:32:14.499 --> 00:32:15.967
OR THINGS ALONG THOSE LINES TO

00:32:16.034 --> 00:32:17.935
ENSURE THAT AN AUTHENTICATION

00:32:18.002 --> 00:32:20.805
SYSTEM COMMUNICATES WELL WITH

00:32:20.872 --> 00:32:22.907
THEM BUT WE ARE NOT PLANNING TO

00:32:22.974 --> 00:32:24.876
TAKE ON HIGH RISK EFFORTS IN

00:32:24.942 --> 00:32:28.313
THIS PILOTS WILL BE. RELATIVELY

00:32:28.379 --> 00:32:30.415
BENIGN SET OF APPLICATIONS

00:32:30.481 --> 00:32:33.885
THANK YOU FOR THAT I APPRECIATE

00:32:33.951 --> 00:32:34.452
IT BECAUSE THAT WAS PART OF

00:32:34.519 --> 00:32:35.620
THAT WAS. PART OF CONCERNS THAT

00:32:35.687 --> 00:32:38.523
WE RAISED- THAT WE HAD THAT I

00:32:38.589 --> 00:32:40.692
HAD IS THAT- THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:32:40.758 --> 00:32:41.859
SOCIAL SERVICES OR HEALTH THE

00:32:41.926 --> 00:32:43.361
HEALTH CARE DEPARTMENT CONTAINS

00:32:43.428 --> 00:32:46.197
A LOT OF- SENSITIVE INFORMATION

00:32:46.264 --> 00:32:48.900
AND- AT MOVIES STAKEHOLDER

00:32:48.966 --> 00:32:51.002
OUTREACH IS PROBABLY GONNA BE

00:32:51.069 --> 00:32:53.371
PRETTY IMPORTANT- COMES UP FOR

00:32:53.438 --> 00:32:55.940
THE DEPLOYMENT OF- ANY OF THIS

00:32:56.007 --> 00:32:57.742
KIND OF TECHNOLOGY. AND THEN

00:32:57.809 --> 00:32:59.243
THE OTHER THE OTHER CONCERNS

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:02.513
AND THAT RAISES THE ISSUE OF

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:05.283
WHAT NON GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES.

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:07.285
IS IT ANTICIPATED THIS THIS

00:33:07.352 --> 00:33:08.953
INFORMATION WOULD BE SHARED

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:13.691
WITH- AT EIGHT OH. NON

00:33:13.758 --> 00:33:15.460
GOVERNMENTAL OR OUR

00:33:15.526 --> 00:33:18.896
GOVERNMENTAL PARTNERS- AGAIN

00:33:18.963 --> 00:33:19.831
BECAUSE OF SENSITIVE

00:33:19.897 --> 00:33:22.333
INFORMATION AND- HOW WOULD YOU

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.168
MITIGATE POTENTIAL SECURITY

00:33:24.235 --> 00:33:26.838
BREACHES AS PART OF THAT. PART

00:33:26.904 --> 00:33:29.440
OF THE PLAN. FROM THERE- LET ME

00:33:29.507 --> 00:33:30.842
ADDRESS THAT I THINK THEY'RE

00:33:30.908 --> 00:33:31.342
ACTUALLY TWO UNDERLYING

00:33:31.409 --> 00:33:34.212
QUESTIONS THERE. THE SECOND ONE

00:33:34.278 --> 00:33:36.381
ON THE MANAGING THE EXPOSURE TO

00:33:36.447 --> 00:33:37.482
SECURITY BREACHES BY

00:33:37.548 --> 00:33:39.384
CENTRALIZING THIS WE ACTUALLY

00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:40.118
HAVE THE TECHNOLOGICAL

00:33:40.184 --> 00:33:42.019
CAPABILITY MANAGING OR

00:33:42.086 --> 00:33:43.721
MONITORING THIS MUCH MORE

00:33:43.788 --> 00:33:45.990
ACTIVELY. RIGHT NOW WITH THOSE

00:33:46.057 --> 00:33:48.059
CREDENTIALS STORED IN THREE

00:33:48.126 --> 00:33:49.227
HUNDRED SYSTEMS ACROSS THE

00:33:49.293 --> 00:33:51.028
STATE IF ONE OF THOSE SYSTEMS

00:33:51.095 --> 00:33:52.864
IS BREACHED TO COMPARING LIKELY

00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:54.298
THOSE SAME CREDENTIALS COULD BE

00:33:54.365 --> 00:33:55.967
USED ACROSS OTHER SYSTEMS. THE

00:33:56.033 --> 00:33:57.835
ABILITY TO MONITOR THE MONITOR

00:33:57.902 --> 00:34:00.171
GOES ACROSS ALL OF THE VARIOUS

00:34:00.238 --> 00:34:01.906
DEPARTMENTS RIGHT NOW ALL

00:34:01.973 --> 00:34:03.741
DEPENDS ON A LOT OF INTERACTION

00:34:03.808 --> 00:34:05.076
AND COMMUNICATION BETWEEN

00:34:05.143 --> 00:34:07.145
DEPARTMENTS. CENTRALIZING IT

00:34:07.211 --> 00:34:09.247
ACTUALLY RAISES THE BAR ON THAT

00:34:09.313 --> 00:34:11.616
SECURITY THROUGH OUR SECURITY

00:34:11.682 --> 00:34:12.817
OPERATIONS CENTER AT THE STATE

00:34:12.884 --> 00:34:14.719
LEVEL WE WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY

00:34:14.786 --> 00:34:17.955
TO DETECT FOR EXAMPLE LOGGINS

00:34:18.022 --> 00:34:20.758
COMING AT EIGHTY EIGHT CASE IT

00:34:20.825 --> 00:34:22.427
IS NOT REASONABLE FOR A SINGLE

00:34:22.493 --> 00:34:23.861
PERSON TO BE ATTEMPTING WALK

00:34:23.928 --> 00:34:25.797
INS. OR FROM DISPARAGING

00:34:25.863 --> 00:34:28.266
GRAPHICAL CATIONS. I CAN'T LOG

00:34:28.332 --> 00:34:30.268
IN FROM SACRAMENTO AND THEN

00:34:30.334 --> 00:34:30.902
TWENTY MINUTES LATER BE LOGGING

00:34:30.968 --> 00:34:37.442
IN FROM. PHOENIX AND TWENTY

00:34:37.508 --> 00:34:38.075
MINUTES AFTER THAT FROM THE C.

00:34:38.142 --> 00:34:38.976
OR FROM ANOTHER CAR. WE THE

00:34:39.043 --> 00:34:40.077
CABLE WITH THIS SYSTEM TO THOSE

00:34:40.144 --> 00:34:41.646
THINGS AND MITIGATE MUCH MORE.

00:34:41.712 --> 00:34:43.581
IF WE NEED TO CLOSE THE DOOR.

00:34:43.648 --> 00:34:46.517
SO THAT THAT THE SYSTEM IS NO

00:34:46.584 --> 00:34:48.753
LONGER ACCESSIBLE BY PASCAL- WE

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:51.255
CAN DO THAT IN ONE PLACE RATHER

00:34:51.322 --> 00:34:53.090
THAN. RATHER THAN HAVING TO GO

00:34:53.157 --> 00:34:55.726
OUT DOWN TO THREE HUNDRED

00:34:55.793 --> 00:34:57.662
DIFFERENT AREAS. ON THE-

00:34:57.728 --> 00:34:59.530
QUESTION OF INFORMATION SHARING

00:34:59.597 --> 00:35:00.965
WE WOULD COLLECT COLLECT

00:35:01.032 --> 00:35:02.400
INFORMATION TO APPROVE THE

00:35:02.467 --> 00:35:04.602
ACCOUNTS BASED ON THE SYSTEMS

00:35:04.669 --> 00:35:07.338
THAT FOLKS WANT ACCESS. AT THE

00:35:07.405 --> 00:35:08.139
POINT THAT WE HAVE PROVEN THAT

00:35:08.206 --> 00:35:10.241
IDENTITY. THEN SOME OF THE

00:35:10.308 --> 00:35:11.809
INFORMATION WOULD ACTUALLY BE

00:35:11.876 --> 00:35:12.643
DELETED WE DON'T NEED TO

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:14.512
MAINTAIN IT. ANYTHING THAT WE

00:35:14.579 --> 00:35:16.714
DO MAINTAIN WOULD BE ENCRYPTED

00:35:16.781 --> 00:35:18.483
AND WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO THE

00:35:18.549 --> 00:35:19.984
RESIDENTS WHO SUBMITTED THAT

00:35:20.051 --> 00:35:22.119
INFORMATION. AND WHAT ALL WOULD

00:35:22.186 --> 00:35:24.622
NOT BE SHARED BY US PROACTIVELY

00:35:24.689 --> 00:35:27.024
WAR UPON REQUEST BY ANY OTHER

00:35:27.091 --> 00:35:30.394
ORGANIZATION. OR ENTITY WITHOUT

00:35:30.461 --> 00:35:31.596
FOLLOWING APPROPRIATE FEDERAL

00:35:31.662 --> 00:35:34.565
OR STATE LAW- AND SO IF THERE

00:35:34.632 --> 00:35:35.900
IS A QUESTION FOR EXAMPLE ABOUT

00:35:35.967 --> 00:35:38.302
LAW ENFORCEMENT- THAT THAT

00:35:38.369 --> 00:35:39.437
REQUEST WOULD HAVE TO GO

00:35:39.504 --> 00:35:43.808
THROUGH EXISTING PROCESSES AND

00:35:43.875 --> 00:35:44.475
WE WOULD OF COURSE ABIDE BY ANY.

00:35:44.542 --> 00:35:47.578
STATUTORY OR POLICY STANCE THAT

00:35:47.645 --> 00:35:50.681
THE STATE HAS A COUPLE. VERY

00:35:50.748 --> 00:35:53.251
GOOD APPRECIATE IF I MAY ADD TO

00:35:53.317 --> 00:35:55.019
THAT ANSWER AT MANAGER JUST ONE

00:35:55.086 --> 00:35:56.420
THING I WANTED TO ALSO LEVEL

00:35:56.487 --> 00:35:58.656
STEPPED UP A CONTEXT WHERE THE

00:35:58.723 --> 00:36:00.658
INFORMATION THAT IS BEING

00:36:00.725 --> 00:36:01.459
COLLECTED THROUGH THE DIGITAL

00:36:01.526 --> 00:36:03.828
ID- IT'S YOU KNOW FROM THE

00:36:03.895 --> 00:36:05.563
DISCOVERY PROCESS IS NOT THIS

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:06.764
IS NOT GOING TO BE ANYTHING

00:36:06.831 --> 00:36:09.100
MORE THAN WHAT THE INDIVIDUAL

00:36:09.166 --> 00:36:10.668
HUNDRED FIFTY PLUS DEPARTMENTS

00:36:10.735 --> 00:36:12.670
POTENTIALLY ALREADY COLLECTING

00:36:12.737 --> 00:36:14.605
THE CRATER USER ACCOUNT. THE

00:36:14.672 --> 00:36:17.108
DIFFERENCES IS THAT INSTEAD OF

00:36:17.174 --> 00:36:18.309
INDIVIDUAL HUNDRED FIFTY

00:36:18.376 --> 00:36:19.210
DEPARTMENTS COLLECTING THEIR

00:36:19.277 --> 00:36:21.312
INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION WE WILL

00:36:21.379 --> 00:36:23.047
BE COLLECTING THE SAME AMOUNT

00:36:23.114 --> 00:36:26.284
POSSIBLE EVEN LAST UP BUT IN A

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:28.319
MUCH MORE STANDARDIZED FORMAT

00:36:28.386 --> 00:36:30.121
SO YOU DO IT ONCE AND THAT

00:36:30.187 --> 00:36:31.989
INDIVIDUAL WILL HAVE TO LOG IN

00:36:32.056 --> 00:36:33.791
TO THE VERY S. PUBLIC SERVICE

00:36:33.858 --> 00:36:36.294
IF THEY WANT ACCESS TO SO I

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:37.161
JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT IT'S

00:36:37.228 --> 00:36:40.164
ALSO. CLEAR THAT IT'S NOT LIKE

00:36:40.231 --> 00:36:42.233
THERE'S GOING TO CREATE A NEW

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:43.668
SETS OF INFORMATION THESE BEES

00:36:43.734 --> 00:36:47.471
COLLECTED. THAT HASN'T ALREADY

00:36:47.538 --> 00:36:48.039
BEEN COLLECTED. I PREFER I

00:36:48.105 --> 00:36:49.874
PREFER THAT. I MEAN I THAT THAT

00:36:49.941 --> 00:36:51.375
IS INDEED THERE'S NOTHING MORE

00:36:51.442 --> 00:36:52.643
FRUSTRATING THAN HAVING TO GIVE

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:54.145
THE SAME INFORMATION OVER AND

00:36:54.211 --> 00:36:56.847
OVER AND OVER AGAIN FOR-

00:36:56.914 --> 00:36:58.649
DIFFERENT PURPOSES BUT ALSO

00:36:58.716 --> 00:37:00.651
ALWAYS. BE IF PEOPLE SEE THE

00:37:00.718 --> 00:37:01.953
STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS ONE

00:37:02.019 --> 00:37:04.422
ENTITY EVEN IF. YOU'RE

00:37:04.488 --> 00:37:08.626
OPERATING OR YOUR- INTERACTING

00:37:08.693 --> 00:37:10.561
WITH DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS- TO

00:37:10.628 --> 00:37:12.763
BE ABLE TO DO IT. IN A WAY THAT

00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:14.332
PROVIDES THE SAME INFORMATION

00:37:14.398 --> 00:37:16.634
EVERYBODY WOULD BE I THINK VERY

00:37:16.701 --> 00:37:19.537
BENEFICIAL AND- BRING US INTO

00:37:19.604 --> 00:37:20.972
THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY IT'S

00:37:21.038 --> 00:37:22.506
FOUND THE QUESTIONS ARE THE

00:37:22.573 --> 00:37:25.176
ISSUE OF SECURITY- EXACTLY WHAT

00:37:25.242 --> 00:37:27.044
THE DATA IT WILL BE USED FOR

00:37:27.111 --> 00:37:30.948
WHETHER. IT'S POSSIBLE TO MY-

00:37:31.015 --> 00:37:32.416
WHETHER THERE'S ANY INTEREST IN

00:37:32.483 --> 00:37:34.485
MONETIZING AND I WOULD THINK

00:37:34.552 --> 00:37:34.952
THE ANSWER TO THAT IS

00:37:35.019 --> 00:37:37.254
ABSOLUTELY NOT- BUT THOSE ARE

00:37:37.321 --> 00:37:38.656
THE KIND OF QUESTIONS I THINK

00:37:38.723 --> 00:37:39.790
THAT WE NEED TO ASK AND TO MAKE

00:37:39.857 --> 00:37:41.993
SURE. MAKE SURE IN THIS REALLY

00:37:42.059 --> 00:37:43.394
I DO UNDERSTAND THIS IS A PILOT

00:37:43.461 --> 00:37:44.595
PROJECT YOU'RE NOT BUILDING THE

00:37:44.662 --> 00:37:46.230
ENTIRE SYSTEM YOU'RE TRYING TO.

00:37:46.297 --> 00:37:52.236
WORK ON. ON TRYING TO CREATE

00:37:52.303 --> 00:37:54.505
THIS SYSTEM IN A WAY THAT WILL

00:37:54.572 --> 00:37:56.707
WORK FOR ALL OF THE DEPARTMENTS

00:37:56.774 --> 00:37:57.942
THAT YOU INTEND TO PUT TOGETHER

00:37:58.009 --> 00:38:01.579

THOUGHT THAT'S GONE INTO THIS

00:38:02.279 --> 00:38:05.583
AND KIND OF THE M. STEP BY STEP

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:06.751
THINKING THAT YOU USED IN IN

00:38:06.817 --> 00:38:07.985
PUTTING THIS TOGETHER RATHER

00:38:08.052 --> 00:38:09.887

ASK A QUESTION. MADAM CHAIRMAN.

01:06:00.289 --> 01:06:04.527
IT IS NOT A JUVENILE. QUESTION

01:06:04.593 --> 01:06:07.330
FOR THESE DAYS AND TIMES WHAT

IS DEFINED AS STATUTORILY OR

01:06:09.932 --> 01:06:12.535
LEGALLY AS A QUOTE MICRO

01:06:12.601 --> 01:06:17.973
BUSINESS. GOOD QUESTION I THINK

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:19.508
WE MAY HAVE DIFFERENT.

01:06:19.575 --> 01:06:21.177
DIFFERENT IDEAS OF WHAT IT

01:06:21.243 --> 01:06:24.547
ENTAILS BASED ON A- BASED ON

01:06:24.613 --> 01:06:25.214
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE SO

01:06:25.281 --> 01:06:28.651
MAYBE I COULD ASK- THE

01:06:28.718 --> 01:06:31.420
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE.

01:06:31.487 --> 01:06:33.956

01:06:34.023 --> 01:06:35.624
MICRO BUSINESSES IF YOU WERE

01:06:35.691 --> 01:06:37.827
THAN TEN EMPLOYEES I BELIEVE

01:06:37.893 --> 01:06:39.729
THAT- HAS BEEN USED BY THE

01:06:39.795 --> 01:06:41.564
SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION-

01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:43.866
BUT I'M NOT SURE- THAT DID THAT

01:06:43.933 --> 01:06:47.069
YOU MENTIONED- CHECKUP THERE

01:06:47.136 --> 01:06:47.536
THERE'S MORE THAN ONE

01:06:47.603 --> 01:06:49.839
DEFINITION OF A MICRO BUSINESS.

01:06:49.905 --> 01:06:53.709
WELL I THINK. WHERE IS THAT

01:06:53.776 --> 01:06:55.244
DOWN IS THAT IN THE CODE BOOK

01:06:55.311 --> 01:06:57.380
IS THAT IN A MEMO BOOK IS IT IN

01:06:57.446 --> 01:06:59.949
A STORYBOOK EIGHT IS IT IN A

01:07:00.015 --> 01:07:01.584
REGULATION THERE'S A RUSH

01:07:01.650 --> 01:07:05.254
STATUTORY FOUNDATION FOR A

01:07:05.321 --> 01:07:07.957
MICRO BUSINESS. WHAT'S THE

01:07:08.023 --> 01:07:15.798
LEGAL FOUNDATION. FORTIETH. IF

01:07:15.865 --> 01:07:17.099
THAT'S A QUESTION FOR THE

01:07:17.166 --> 01:07:18.033
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE

01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:20.903
CAN- I'M NOT AWARE OF A

01:07:20.970 --> 01:07:22.805
STATUTORY DEFINITION OF A MICRO

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:24.440
BUSINESS BUT WE CAN- LOOK INTO

01:07:24.507 --> 01:07:25.207
THAT AND GET BACK TO YOU AND

01:07:25.274 --> 01:07:26.942
YOUR STAFF WELL YES WE'RE

01:07:27.009 --> 01:07:29.178
TALKING ALL ABOUT DOING THINGS

01:07:29.245 --> 01:07:30.579
FOR MICRO BUSINESSES BUT WE

01:07:30.646 --> 01:07:32.848
DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT OR WHO

01:07:32.915 --> 01:07:34.917
WE'RE DOING THINGS FOR. THAT'S

01:07:34.984 --> 01:07:38.254
NOT A VERY GOOD WAY TO PROCEED

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:39.455
SO PLEASE IF YOU'D BE SO KIND.

01:07:39.522 --> 01:07:41.424
WE'LL GET TO THAT DEFINITION

01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:44.493
SENATOR I THINK- S. EIGHT YOU

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:45.828
MAY REMEMBER THAT- WHEN WE WERE

01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:47.963
DOING OUR SMALL BUSINESS GRANT.

01:07:48.030 --> 01:07:50.633
PROGRAM THAT WE HAD DISCUSSIONS

01:07:50.699 --> 01:07:52.201
ABOUT. TRYING TO REACH DEEPER

01:07:52.268 --> 01:07:54.804
INTO THE SMALL BUSINESS SECTOR.

01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:59.041
AND THERE WERE A NUMBER OF- OF

01:07:59.108 --> 01:08:00.943
THAT SMALL BUSINESSES AND I

01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:04.814
THINK THE ONE OF THE TESTIMONY-

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:06.182
WHAT IS THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER

01:08:06.248 --> 01:08:09.385
OF. PEOPLE WHO HAVE THEIR OWN

01:08:09.452 --> 01:08:12.655
BUSINESSES BETTER- BETTER HOME

01:08:12.721 --> 01:08:14.790
BUSINESSES SO THEY COOK AT HOME

01:08:14.857 --> 01:08:15.825
AND THEN THEY SELL OUT OF THE

01:08:15.891 --> 01:08:18.894
BACK OF A TRUCK OR THE ID CODE

01:08:18.961 --> 01:08:21.230
YOU KNOW TO BUSINESSES- THE

01:08:21.297 --> 01:08:23.599
TAMALE LADY COMES TO MIND TO

01:08:23.666 --> 01:08:26.769
MIND BUT ALSO- THERE ARE ALL OF

01:08:26.836 --> 01:08:28.170
THE VENDORS THAT THAT SELL

01:08:28.237 --> 01:08:29.872
FRUIT OUT OF THE BACK OF A

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:33.375
TRUCK. THEY SELL ICE CREAM BE

01:08:33.442 --> 01:08:34.977
IT WITH THE LITTLE CARDS THAT

01:08:35.044 --> 01:08:37.446
ARE INDIVIDUAL PARTS MAYBE EVEN

01:08:37.513 --> 01:08:40.349
THE ICE CREAM AND WEAR THEIR-

01:08:40.416 --> 01:08:43.719
THEIR THEIR THEIR THEIR OWN

01:08:43.786 --> 01:08:47.423
BUSINESS- AND THEY DON'T HAVE.

01:08:47.490 --> 01:08:50.226
A THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE ABLE

01:08:50.292 --> 01:08:53.395
TO- THINK CORP INCORPORATOR TO

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:55.564
BE YOU KNOW FOLLOW THE KINDS OF

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:57.700
A BUSINESS PROCESS BECAUSE

01:08:57.766 --> 01:09:02.638
THEY'RE THEY'RE. THEY'RE MICRO

01:09:02.705 --> 01:09:03.405
IF YOU WILL- WHAT WE WANT TO DO

01:09:03.472 --> 01:09:03.906
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD

01:09:03.973 --> 01:09:05.875
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE BUSINESSES.

01:09:05.941 --> 01:09:07.510
THAT HAVE STOPPED OPERATING

01:09:07.576 --> 01:09:10.846
ENTIRELY- IT'S ALSO THE TACO

01:09:10.913 --> 01:09:13.449
TRUCKS MEET IT AS WELL- THEN

01:09:13.516 --> 01:09:16.185
THEY HAVE AN ABILITY TO

01:09:16.252 --> 01:09:17.686
PARTICIPATE IN A PROGRAM WHERE

01:09:17.753 --> 01:09:18.988
THEY THEY COULD ALSO ACCESS

01:09:19.054 --> 01:09:21.991
GRANT FUNDS- WE DID NOT INCLUDE

01:09:22.057 --> 01:09:25.194
THEM IN THE- IN THE SMALL

01:09:25.261 --> 01:09:27.062
BUSINESS GRANT PROGRAM BECAUSE

01:09:27.129 --> 01:09:29.198
WE JUST COULDN'T- FIGURE OUT A

01:09:29.265 --> 01:09:30.966
WAY TO BE ABLE TO REACH THAT

01:09:31.033 --> 01:09:34.203
FAR INTO THE- INTO THE SMALL

01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:40.009
BUSINESS- AT. AT AREA AND SO

01:09:40.075 --> 01:09:41.977
THIS I THINK IS THE RESPONSE TO

01:09:42.044 --> 01:09:42.945
THAT BUT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY

01:09:43.012 --> 01:09:43.812
RIGHT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

01:09:43.879 --> 01:09:46.749
DEFINE WHAT CONSTITUTES A MICRO

01:09:46.815 --> 01:09:49.552
BUSINESS- AND I WOULD EXPECT

01:09:49.618 --> 01:09:52.154
THAT IF YOU WERE ELIGIBLE UNDER

01:09:52.221 --> 01:09:53.923
THE OTHER PROGRAM YOU WOULDN'T

01:09:53.989 --> 01:09:56.559
BE ELIGIBLE UNDER THIS PROGRAM-

01:09:56.625 --> 01:09:59.595
BUT- THIS IS. AN ITEM THAT IS A

01:09:59.662 --> 01:10:01.463
I BELIEVE IT'S A- HOLD OPEN

01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:04.300
ITEM SO IT MORE ON THAT LATER.

01:10:04.366 --> 01:10:06.302
BUT THE IDEA IS TO TRY TO

01:10:06.368 --> 01:10:08.103
FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE IDENTIFY

01:10:08.170 --> 01:10:09.939
THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE HAD

01:10:10.005 --> 01:10:11.974
A SMALL BUSINESS IF THEY THEY

01:10:12.041 --> 01:10:14.510
DIDN'T HAVE THAT. A LOCATION

01:10:14.577 --> 01:10:16.111
READ THAT THEY'RE PAYING AND

01:10:16.178 --> 01:10:17.746
STAFF THAT THEY'RE PAYING AND

01:10:17.813 --> 01:10:18.948
SO THIS IS THE ATTEMPT TO REACH

01:10:19.014 --> 01:10:21.150
THEM SO WE HEAR YOUR POINT IS

01:10:21.216 --> 01:10:22.518
WELL TAKEN I THINK WE THIS IS A

01:10:22.585 --> 01:10:24.687
SENATE PROPOSAL- WE LEFT SOME

01:10:24.753 --> 01:10:25.487
PEOPLE OUT OF THE SMALL

01:10:25.554 --> 01:10:26.855
BUSINESS GRANT PROGRAM AND WE

01:10:26.922 --> 01:10:27.923
WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE CAPTURING

01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:30.159
THEM. I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S

01:10:30.225 --> 01:10:31.961
VERY CLEAR BUT I THINK IN TIME

01:10:32.027 --> 01:10:32.962
TERMS OF THE TACO TRACTION

01:10:33.028 --> 01:10:37.032
GESTURE. THEY'RE VERY IMPORTANT.

01:10:37.099 --> 01:10:38.100
DEFINITELY THERE. AND YOU KNOW

01:10:38.167 --> 01:10:39.134
IN MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES

01:10:39.201 --> 01:10:40.736
THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT I THINK

01:10:40.803 --> 01:10:43.072
THE TESTIMONY FROM- LA WAS THAT

01:10:43.138 --> 01:10:44.607
IT'S A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

01:10:44.673 --> 01:10:45.874
DOLLAR CONTRIBUTION TO THEIR

01:10:45.941 --> 01:10:48.143
LOCAL ECONOMY. IT SAYS IT SAYS

01:10:48.210 --> 01:10:49.712
THAT SIGNIFICANT AERO

01:10:49.778 --> 01:10:52.414
CALIFORNIA. THOSE ARE THE THAT

01:10:52.481 --> 01:10:54.350
USUALLY THEY'RE THAT THE-

01:10:54.416 --> 01:10:56.819
BUSINESSES THAT GROW OVER TIME

01:10:56.885 --> 01:10:59.188
AND THAT. THEN END UP. RENTING

01:10:59.254 --> 01:11:01.323
A LOCATION AND SERVING. SERVING

01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:03.626
MEALS AND- AND OTHER ACTIVITIES

01:11:03.692 --> 01:11:05.461
SO- WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:11:05.527 --> 01:11:06.462
THAT WE'RE WE'RE CAPTURING THEM

01:11:06.528 --> 01:11:08.597
SO I'M- I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THIS

01:11:08.664 --> 01:11:09.999
I'M I THINK THIS IS A- A REALLY

01:11:10.065 --> 01:11:11.567
GOOD IDEA AND I. I DO THINK

01:11:11.634 --> 01:11:12.434
