MANY SMALL PRIVATELY HELD CORPORATIONS ARE OPERATING WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF LEGAL COUNSEL AND UNINTENTIONALLY FAIL TO COMPLY WITH ALL THE FORMALITIES REQUIRED BY CALIFORNIA'S CORPORATE LAW. BRIAR MISTAKES ARE OFTEN DISCOVERED WHEN BUSINESSES UNDERTAKE SIGNIFICANT CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS SUCH AS SEEKING OUTSIDE FUNDING SELLING THE BUSINESS OF ACQUIRING ANOTHER BUSINESS OR UNDERTAKING INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING. CORRECTIVE ACTION IS OFTEN NECESSARY TO PROCEED WITH THE DESIRED TRANSACTION. SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY EXISTS UNDER CORPORATE LAW CALIFORNIA COOPER A LOT ABOUT HOW TO CORRECT CORPORATE ACTIONS THAT FAIL TO COMPLY WITH LEGAL REQUIREMENTS WHEN ORIGINALLY UNDERTAKEN. THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN MODEL BUSINESS CORPORATION ACT SUGGESTED ADDING PROVISIONS TO RATIFY DEFECTIVE CORPORATE ACTS. AND AT LEAST NINE OTHER STATES HAVE RECENTLY AMENDED THEIR CORPORATE STATUTES TO INCLUDE PROVISIONS FOR RATIFICATION OR VALIDATION. CONNECTICUT DELAWARE KANSAS NEVADA NORTH CAROLINA OKLAHOMA TEXAS VIRGINIA AND WASHINGTON. CALIFORNIA SHOULD JOIN THESE OTHER STATES AND SET FORTH A PATH FOR BUSINESSES TO CORRECT THE PREVIOUS INADVERTENT MISTAKES I HAVE A PRACTITIONER ON THE CO HOST TELECONFERENCE LINE TO SHARE THEIR RULED EXPERIENCE- WHEN YOU'RE READY TO HEAR FROM THE TESTIMONY MADAM CHAIR. GREAT THANK YOU WE WILL MOVE ON TO THAT TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT TO THE CONSTRAINTS REGARDING THE LENGTH OF HEARINGS TECHNOLOGY AND CONSIDERATIONS. THAT CAN- WE WILL ESTABLISH A TIME LIMIT OF THREE MINUTES EACH EACH SIDE WILL BE PERMITTED IN AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF TIME. SO WE WILL BEGIN BY CALLING THE FIRST WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

THANK YOU THE BILL HAS SIX VOTES WE WILL LEAVE THAT ON CALL BUT IT DOES MOVE FORWARD AND SENATOR JOHN DO YOU ALSO HAVE THE SECOND BILL SB TWO EIGHTY EIGHT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- S. B. TWO EIGHTY EIGHT ESTABLISHES A SINGLE STEP CONVERSION PROCESS FOR CALIFORNIA CORPORATIONS TO BECOME FOREIGN CORPORATIONS. BUSINESS OWNERS OFTEN DESIRE TO CHANGE THE FORM OF ORGANIZATION OF THEIR BUSINESS OR THE STATE IN WHICH THEIR BUSINESSES FORMED. HIS BABY'S NECESSARY FOR EXAMPLE TO RESPOND TO CHANGING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. CHANGES IN THE BUSINESSES THEY CAN DOCTOR CHANGES IN THE SHAREHOLDERS PRIORITIES. MY CALIFORNIA PROVIDES A MECHANISM FOR PARTNERSHIPS AND LLCS TO CONVERT FROM ONE TYPE OF ENTITY TO ANOTHER IN A SINGLE STEP. IS ONE OF THE FEW STATES THAT DOES NOT OFFER A SINGLE STEP PROCESS FOR THE CONVERSION OF A CORPORATION. THE CALIFORNIA CORPORATION DESIRES TO CONVERT INTO A DELAWARE CORPORATION FOR EXAMPLE MUST EITHER. INCORPORATE A NEW CORPORATION DELAWARE AD THEN MERGE THE TWO ENTITIES TOGETHER. WITH THE DELAWARE CORPORATION SURVIVING THE MERGER AND THE CALIFORNIA CORPORATION CEASING TO EXIST. OR CONVERT INTO ANOTHER TYPE OF CALIFORNIA BUSINESS ENTITY. SUCH AS A PARTNERSHIP OR LLC AND THEN CONVERT THAT INTO T. INTO A DELAWARE CORPORATION. MULTI STEP CONVERSIONS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE CUMBERSOME TIME CONSUMING AND EXPENSIVE. THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE CORPORATIONS WITH THE SAME FLEXIBILITY AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIPS AND LLCS. AND CORPORATIONS AND OTHER STATES AGAIN I HAVE A TECHNICIAN OR- ON THE COAST TELECONFERENCE LINE. TO SHARE SOME THOUGHTS REGARDING THE BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR.
