THE LATE NINETEEN SEVENTIES.

00:33:57.903 --> 00:34:01.239 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S KIND OF DARKER GRAY

00:33:59.538 --> 00:34:03.275 region:rollup2
AREA YOU CAN ALSO SEE HOW

RELATIVELY SMALL ROLE.

00:34:07.445 --> 00:34:10.115 region:rollup2
AND AS YOU'LL HEAR IN THE SECOND

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:11.449 region:rollup2
PANEL THAT'S BECAUSE

00:34:10.115 --> 00:34:12.817 region:rollup2
HISTORICALLY COMMITTEE COLLEGE

SIGNIFICANT WAY.

00:34:32.971 --> 00:34:36.541 region:rollup2
AND THEN YOU CAN ALSO SEE THOUGH

AT THE TAIL END OF THE GRAPH YOU

00:34:36.541 --> 00:34:39.811 region:rollup2
CAN SEE THE THE INCREASE IN

00:35:59.924 --> 00:36:03.294 region:rollup2
HISTORICALLY COMMUNITY COLLEGES

00:36:01.793 --> 00:36:04.996 region:rollup2
HAVE RECEIVE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT

00:36:03.294 --> 00:36:06.698 region:rollup2
AMOUNTS OF FUNDING.

00:36:04.996 --> 00:36:08.400 region:rollup2
A PER STUDENT TO SERVE THEIR

00:36:06.698 --> 00:36:10.001 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:11.903 region:rollup2
IN THE MID TWO THOUSANDS THE

00:36:10.001 --> 00:36:13.505 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE PROVIDED FUNDING

00:36:11.903 --> 00:36:16.107 region:rollup2
OVER A SEVERAL YEAR PERIOD TO

00:36:13.505 --> 00:36:18.143 region:rollup2
EQUALIZE PER STUDENT FUNDING

00:36:16.107 --> 00:36:19.110 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

00:36:18.143 --> 00:36:20.979 region:rollup2
AND JUST TO NOTE THAT THIS

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:22.881 region:rollup2
EFFORT AFFECTED APPORTIONMENT

00:36:20.979 --> 00:36:23.682 region:rollup2
FUNDING FOR CREDIT IN STRUCK XIN

00:36:22.881 --> 00:36:25.550 region:rollup2
WHICH IS LARGELY COLLEGE LEVEL

00:36:23.682 --> 00:36:26.718 region:rollup2

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:28.820 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS ALREADY HAD BEEN

00:36:26.718 --> 00:36:30.889 region:rollup2
RECEIVING THE SAME PER STUDENT

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:32.791 region:rollup2
AMOUNT FOR NONCREDIT INSTRUCTION

00:36:30.889 --> 00:36:34.025 region:rollup2
WITCHES ARE LARGELY PRE

COLLEGIATE ADULT LEVEL TYPE

00:36:34.025 --> 00:36:38.463 region:rollup2
CLASSES.

00:36:36.327 --> 00:36:39.931 region:rollup2
HISTORICALLY COMMUNITY COLLEGES

00:36:38.463 --> 00:36:42.067 region:rollup2
HAVE RECEIVED A PORTION FUNDS

00:36:39.931 --> 00:36:43.635 region:rollup2
BASED ON ENROLLMENT.

00:36:42.067 --> 00:36:46.304 region:rollup2
FUNDING THAT WAY HAS CREATED A

00:36:43.635 --> 00:36:48.039 region:rollup2
STRONG INCENTIVE FOR COLLEGES TO

00:36:46.304 --> 00:36:49.774 region:rollup2
PROVIDE ACCESS TO STUDENTS.

00:36:48.039 --> 00:36:51.509 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S BEEN CRITICISM OVER

00:36:49.774 --> 00:36:52.610 region:rollup2
THE YEARS THAT FUNDING BASED ON

00:36:51.509 --> 00:36:54.813 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT DOESN'T CREATE A

00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:56.181 region:rollup2
STRONG INCENTIVE FOR COLLEGES TO

00:36:54.813 --> 00:36:57.949 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT STUDENTS

00:36:56.181 --> 00:36:59.250 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFULLY MAKE IT THROUGH A

00:36:57.949 --> 00:37:01.186 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AND EARNED A DEGREE OR

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:02.487 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATE.

00:37:01.186 --> 00:37:04.456 region:rollup2
SO JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO THE

00:37:02.487 --> 00:37:05.490 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR AGREED

00:37:04.456 --> 00:37:07.225 region:rollup2
TO FUND COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:09.127 region:rollup2
APPORTIONMENT SPACE AT LEAST IN

00:37:07.225 --> 00:37:10.028 region:rollup2
PART ON STUDENT OUTCOMES SUCH AS

00:37:09.127 --> 00:37:12.030 region:rollup2
DEGREE AND CERTIFICATE

00:37:10.028 --> 00:37:13.031 region:rollup2
ACHIEVEMENT.

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:14.332 region:rollup2
AND AS THE HEAD OUT DOES NOTE

00:37:13.031 --> 00:37:16.167 region:rollup2
NONCREDIT APPORTIONMENT

00:37:14.332 --> 00:37:17.969 region:rollup2
CONTINUES TO BE BASED ENTIRELY

00:37:16.167 --> 00:37:19.671 region:rollup2
ON ENROLLMENT.

00:37:17.969 --> 00:37:21.639 region:rollup2
NOW THE NEW FUNDING FORMULA ALSO

00:37:19.671 --> 00:37:24.642 region:rollup2
GIVES A SUPPLEMENTAL PER STUDENT

00:37:21.639 --> 00:37:26.411 region:rollup2
AMOUNTS FOR COLLEGES ARE SERVING

00:37:24.642 --> 00:37:28.146 region:rollup2
LOW INCOME STUDENTS TO EACH LOW

00:37:26.411 --> 00:37:30.148 region:rollup2
INCOME STUDENTS COLLEGE SERVES

00:37:28.146 --> 00:37:31.015 region:rollup2
GETS AT A BUMP IN IN THE AMOUNT

00:37:30.148 --> 00:37:32.350 region:rollup2
OF PROPORTIONATE FUNDING IT

00:37:31.015 --> 00:37:34.185 region:rollup2
RECEIVES A GRAD.

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:35.286 region:rollup2
AGAIN FOR CREDIT INSTRUCTION.

00:37:34.185 --> 00:37:36.421 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS TO RECOGNIZE A

00:37:35.286 --> 00:37:37.756 region:rollup2
GENERALLY HIGHER COSTS THAT

00:37:36.421 --> 00:37:40.125 region:rollup2
COLLEGE IS IN HER TO EDUCATE THE

00:37:37.756 --> 00:37:41.626 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

00:37:40.125 --> 00:37:42.727 region:rollup2
ALONG WITH THE NEW FUNDING

00:37:41.626 --> 00:37:44.195 region:rollup2
FORMULA THE LEGISLATURE

00:37:42.727 --> 00:37:45.096 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATED THREE STUDENT

00:37:44.195 --> 00:37:47.165 region:rollup2
SUPPORT PROGRAMS INTO A BLOCK

00:37:45.096 --> 00:37:50.969 region:rollup2
GRANT.

00:37:47.165 --> 00:37:53.605 region:rollup2
THAT'S AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE.

00:37:50.969 --> 00:37:55.073 region:rollup2
THREE SO PAGE FOR A REALLY TAKES

00:37:53.605 --> 00:37:57.008 region:rollup2
A LOOK AT YOU IN LIGHT OF THIS

00:37:55.073 --> 00:37:59.477 region:rollup2
HISTORICAL CONTEXT IN LIGHT OF

00:37:57.008 --> 00:38:01.412 region:rollup2
RECENT BUDGET RELATED CHANGES.

00:37:59.477 --> 00:38:06.718 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE MAJOR

00:38:01.412 --> 00:38:08.953 region:rollup2
ISSUES FACING THE LEGISLATURE?

00:38:06.718 --> 00:38:10.355 region:rollup2
THE FIRST IS THE HAND OUT A AS

00:38:08.953 --> 00:38:11.222 region:rollup2
NOTED OVER THE YEARS COMMITTEE

00:38:10.355 --> 00:38:12.557 region:rollup2
COLLEGE FUNDING HAS BEEN

00:38:11.222 --> 00:38:14.159 region:rollup2
NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY

00:38:12.557 --> 00:38:15.860 region:rollup2
RECESSIONS AND STRONGLY AFFECTED

00:38:14.159 --> 00:38:17.829 region:rollup2
BY RECESSIONS.

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:19.764 region:rollup2
THE MAIN PROTECTION AGAINST CUTS

00:38:17.829 --> 00:38:22.934 region:rollup2
DURING RECESSIONS IS A STRONG

00:38:19.764 --> 00:38:23.568 region:rollup2
RESERVE AND BY THE END OF TWO

00:38:22.934 --> 00:38:24.569 region:rollup2
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IT'S

00:38:23.568 --> 00:38:25.136 region:rollup2
ESTIMATED THAT THE STATE WILL

00:38:24.569 --> 00:38:26.805 region:rollup2
HAVE.

00:38:25.136 --> 00:38:28.540 region:rollup2
A TOTAL RESERVE OF ABOUT SIXTEEN

00:38:26.805 --> 00:38:30.775 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS.

00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:33.011 region:rollup2
AS YOU'LL HEAR A WAY AGAIN WHEN

00:38:30.775 --> 00:38:34.679 region:rollup2
YOU DISCUSS THE UNIVERSITIES AND

00:38:33.011 --> 00:38:35.947 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT ONGOING ISSUE FOR THE

00:38:34.679 --> 00:38:38.216 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE.

00:38:35.947 --> 00:38:40.652 region:rollup2
IS WHAT LEVEL OF RESERVES TO

00:38:38.216 --> 00:38:42.220 region:rollup2
SHOOT FOR IN THE COMING YEARS.

00:38:40.652 --> 00:38:43.755 region:rollup2
SECOND THE LEGISLATURE FACES AN

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:45.557 region:rollup2
ONGOING QUESTION OF HOW MUCH

00:38:43.755 --> 00:38:47.091 region:rollup2
FUNDING IS PROVIDED VIA

00:38:45.557 --> 00:38:49.093 region:rollup2
APPORTIONMENT AS OPPOSED TO

00:38:47.091 --> 00:38:50.161 region:rollup2
CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS.

00:38:49.093 --> 00:38:51.329 region:rollup2
NOW COMMUNITY COLLEGE OFFICIALS

00:38:50.161 --> 00:38:53.398 region:rollup2
TENDER [inaudible]

00:38:51.329 --> 00:38:55.333 region:rollup2
PREFER APPORTIONMENT GIVE THEM

00:38:53.398 --> 00:38:57.602 region:rollup2
MORE FLEXIBILITY TO ADDRESS

00:38:55.333 --> 00:38:58.937 region:rollup2
LOCAL PRIORITIES OF THE

00:38:57.602 --> 00:39:00.171 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGE OF RESTRICTION AS

00:38:58.937 --> 00:39:02.607 region:rollup2
RESTRICTED FUNDING FROM THE

00:39:00.171 --> 00:39:03.408 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE OF THE LEGISLATURE

00:39:02.607 --> 00:39:05.043 region:rollup2
IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN

00:39:03.408 --> 00:39:07.946 region:rollup2
TARGET FUNDS [inaudible]

00:39:05.043 --> 00:39:09.714 region:rollup2
FOR STATEWIDE PRIORITIES.

00:39:07.946 --> 00:39:12.483 region:rollup2
THIRD THE LEGISLATURE WILL WANT

00:39:09.714 --> 00:39:14.519 region:rollup2
TO MONITOR CLOSELY THE EFFECTS

00:39:12.483 --> 00:39:15.386 region:rollup2
OF THE NEW FUNDING FORMULA ON

00:39:14.519 --> 00:39:17.222 region:rollup2
COLLEGE OPERATIONS AND STUDENT

00:39:15.386 --> 00:39:18.690 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES.

00:39:17.222 --> 00:39:21.059 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE ISSUES TO RESOLVE

00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:22.393 region:rollup2
IS WHETHER NONCREDIT INSTRUCTION

00:39:21.059 --> 00:39:23.561 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE FUNDED AS A BASE AT

00:39:22.393 --> 00:39:25.863 region:rollup2
LEAST BASED IN PART ON STUDENT

00:39:23.561 --> 00:39:27.365 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES.

00:39:25.863 --> 00:39:29.567 region:rollup2
NOW RELATED TO THE ISSUES OF

00:39:27.365 --> 00:39:30.869 region:rollup2
BOTH SPENDING FLEXIBILITY AND

00:39:29.567 --> 00:39:32.537 region:rollup2
THE NEW FUNDING FORMULA.

00:39:30.869 --> 00:39:35.006 region:rollup2
OF THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO

00:39:32.537 --> 00:39:36.808 region:rollup2
DECIDE WHETHER OTHER CATEGORICAL

00:39:35.006 --> 00:39:38.309 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS SHOULD BE CONSOLIDATED

00:39:36.808 --> 00:39:41.045 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE OTHER TWENTY SEVEN

00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:43.815 region:rollup2
OR SO THAT ARE STILL INTACT.

00:39:41.045 --> 00:39:45.383 region:rollup2
THE LAST POINT ON PAGE FOUR OF

00:39:43.815 --> 00:39:46.985 region:rollup2
THE HAND OUT CONCERNS FUNDED

00:39:45.383 --> 00:39:48.887 region:rollup2
INSTRUCTION AND WHETHER THE

00:39:46.985 --> 00:39:50.288 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE SHOULD PROMOTE MORE

00:39:48.887 --> 00:39:51.723 region:rollup2
NONTRADITIONAL INSTRUCTIONAL

00:39:50.288 --> 00:39:53.825 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES STRATEGIES THROUGH

00:39:51.723 --> 00:39:55.493 region:rollup2
ITS FUNDING POLICIES. FOR

00:39:53.825 --> 00:39:57.228 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE BEST PRACTICES IN OTHER

00:39:55.493 --> 00:39:59.464 region:rollup2
EDUCATION SYSTEMS IDENTIFY

00:39:57.228 --> 00:40:01.332 region:rollup2
COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION AND

00:39:59.464 --> 00:40:03.668 region:rollup2
PRIOR LEARNING ASSESSMENT SUCH

00:40:01.332 --> 00:40:05.103 region:rollup2
AS CHALLENGE TESTS ON COURSES.

00:40:03.668 --> 00:40:08.206 region:rollup2
AS A WAY TO ACCELERATE STUDENT

00:40:05.103 --> 00:40:09.607 region:rollup2
PROGRESS YET CURRENTLY COLLEGES

00:40:08.206 --> 00:40:11.542 region:rollup2
DO NOT HAVE A STRONG FINANCIAL

00:40:09.607 --> 00:40:13.511 region:rollup2
INCENTIVE TO LET ALREADY SKILLED

00:40:11.542 --> 00:40:14.479 region:rollup2
STUDENTS BYPASS CERTAIN CLASSES

00:40:13.511 --> 00:40:16.214 region:rollup2
IN PURSUIT OF A DEGREE OR

00:40:14.479 --> 00:40:17.315 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATE.

00:40:16.214 --> 00:40:18.816 region:rollup2
ALSO LOOKING AHEAD THE

00:40:17.315 --> 00:40:20.618 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO REVISIT

00:40:18.816 --> 00:40:21.719 region:rollup2
HOW FUNDING POLICIES CAN BETTER

00:40:20.618 --> 00:40:23.388 region:rollup2
SUPPORT NONTRADITIONAL

00:40:21.719 --> 00:40:24.856 region:rollup2
INSTRUCTION AND THIS GOES TO

00:40:23.388 --> 00:40:26.891 region:rollup2
YOUR POINT AT THE BEGINNING IN

00:40:24.856 --> 00:40:27.425 region:rollup2
YOUR OPENING REMARKS THAT MISTER

00:40:26.891 --> 00:40:29.193 region:rollup2
CHAIR ABOUT.

00:40:27.425 --> 00:40:30.561 region:rollup2
AYE WAIT LOOKING FOR WAYS THE

00:40:29.193 --> 00:40:32.530 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE IN THE STATECAN

00:40:30.561 --> 00:40:33.564 region:rollup2
RESPOND TO INNOVATIVE CHANGES

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:35.166 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:40:33.564 --> 00:40:36.467 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE NEVER PREVIOUSLY BEEN

00:40:35.166 --> 00:40:38.036 region:rollup2
ENVISIONED SO THERE THERE MIGHT

00:40:36.467 --> 00:40:39.070 region:rollup2
BE INSTRUCTIONAL PRACTICES IN

00:40:38.036 --> 00:40:41.706 region:rollup2
THE FUTURE WE HAVEN'T EVEN

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:44.776 region:rollup2
DISSIPATED NOW AND JUST KEEPING.

00:40:41.706 --> 00:40:46.377 region:rollup2
THE POLICIES AND THE LEGISLATIVE

00:40:44.776 --> 00:40:47.145 region:rollup2
AYE ON SOME OF THOSE

00:40:46.377 --> 00:40:47.445 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENTS AS THEY OCCUR

00:40:47.145 --> 00:40:51.382 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:40:47.445 --> 00:40:52.984 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

MY PRESENTATION WILL FOCUS ON

00:40:54.385 --> 00:40:57.388 region:rollup2
THE TWO UNIVERSITY SEGMENTS AND

00:40:55.954 --> 00:40:59.257 region:rollup2
I WOULD DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION TO

00:40:57.388 --> 00:40:59.824 region:rollup2
THAT HAND OUT ON THAT THAT'S YES

00:40:59.257 --> 00:41:02.260 region:rollup2
YOU AND YOU SEE MAJOR BUDGET

00:40:59.824 --> 00:41:03.695 region:rollup2
TRENDS.

00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:05.963 region:rollup2
THE FORMAT OF MY PRESENTATION

00:41:03.695 --> 00:41:07.398 region:rollup2
WILL BE VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU

00:41:05.963 --> 00:41:08.933 region:rollup2
HEARD IN THE CCC PRESENTATION.

00:41:07.398 --> 00:41:10.935 region:rollup2
OF FOCUS FIRST ON A MAJOR

00:41:08.933 --> 00:41:13.338 region:rollup2
FUNDING DEVELOPMENTS OVER THE

00:41:10.935 --> 00:41:14.439 region:rollup2
YEARS ALL THEN FOCUS ON HOW

00:41:13.338 --> 00:41:15.707 region:rollup2
CHANGES IN THE WAYS THE STATE

00:41:14.439 --> 00:41:17.075 region:rollup2
HAS DETERMINED HOW MUCH FUNDING

00:41:15.707 --> 00:41:17.775 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE THE TO UNIVERSITY

00:41:17.075 --> 00:41:19.477 region:rollup2
SEGMENTS.

00:41:17.775 --> 00:41:20.845 region:rollup2
AND THEN I'LL CONCLUDE WITH SOME

00:41:19.477 --> 00:41:22.780 region:rollup2
AREAS FOR YOU TO CONSIDER AS YOU

00:41:20.845 --> 00:41:24.983 region:rollup2
REVIEW BUDGET PRACTICES FOR THE

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:26.217 region:rollup2
TO UNIVERSITY SEGMENTS. ONE

00:41:24.983 --> 00:41:27.485 region:rollup2
THING NOTE TO KNOW JUST BEFORE I

00:41:26.217 --> 00:41:28.519 region:rollup2
DELVE INTO THE HAND OUT OF MY

00:41:27.485 --> 00:41:30.521 region:rollup2
PRESENTATION WILL FOCUS

00:41:28.519 --> 00:41:31.689 region:rollup2
PRIMARILY ON WHAT WE REFER TO AS

00:41:30.521 --> 00:41:33.091 region:rollup2
CORE FUNDING.

00:41:31.689 --> 00:41:35.226 region:rollup2
THAT IS STATE FUNDING AND

00:41:33.091 --> 00:41:36.461 region:rollup2
STUDENT TUITION AND FEES THESE

00:41:35.226 --> 00:41:38.062 region:rollup2
TWO SOURCES OF FUNDS ARE WHAT

00:41:36.461 --> 00:41:40.865 region:rollup2
ARE THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF FUNDS

00:41:38.062 --> 00:41:42.467 region:rollup2
FOR THE EDUCATION BUDGETS.

00:41:40.865 --> 00:41:43.701 region:rollup2

CENTERS STUDENT HOUSING AND THE

DINING AND RECREATION AND OTHER

00:41:51.075 --> 00:41:55.179 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES LIKE THAT WILL BE

00:41:52.543 --> 00:41:57.582 region:rollup2
EXCLUDED FROM THIS PRESENTATION.

00:41:55.179 --> 00:42:00.485 region:rollup2
RETURNING TO PAGE ONE WE PROVIDE

00:41:57.582 --> 00:42:02.453 region:rollup2
AN OVERVIEW OF SOME OF THE KEYED

00:42:00.485 --> 00:42:04.856 region:rollup2
A DEVELOPMENTS OVER THE YEARS OF

00:42:02.453 --> 00:42:07.225 region:rollup2
INVOLVING CORE FUNDING.

00:42:04.856 --> 00:42:08.259 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU CAN CHARACTERIZE ALL

00:42:07.225 --> 00:42:10.361 region:rollup2
OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS OVER THE

00:42:08.259 --> 00:42:11.529 region:rollup2
YEARS AND IT INTO KEY TRENDS THE

00:42:10.361 --> 00:42:13.798 region:rollup2
FIRST IS.

00:42:11.529 --> 00:42:15.700 region:rollup2
OVERALL CORE FUNDING FOR A CSU

00:42:13.798 --> 00:42:17.635 region:rollup2
AND YOU SEE.

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:18.269 region:rollup2
OVERALL CORE FUNDING HAS BEEN

00:42:17.635 --> 00:42:20.304 region:rollup2
SOMEWHAT VOLATILE OVER THE YEARS

00:42:18.269 --> 00:42:22.206 region:rollup2
--

00:42:20.304 --> 00:42:24.475 region:rollup2
INCREASING WHEN OF STATE

00:42:22.206 --> 00:42:25.877 region:rollup2
REVENUES WERE GENERALLY STRONG

00:42:24.475 --> 00:42:28.579 region:rollup2
AND DECREASING WHEN STATE

00:42:25.877 --> 00:42:30.148 region:rollup2
REVENUES WERE GENERALLY WEAK.

00:42:28.579 --> 00:42:31.916 region:rollup2
AMONG OTHER VOLATILITY HAS

00:42:30.148 --> 00:42:33.284 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY BEEN ON THE EDGE THE

00:42:31.916 --> 00:42:34.952 region:rollup2
STATE GENERAL FUND SIDE.

00:42:33.284 --> 00:42:36.788 region:rollup2
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT A FUNDING PER

00:42:34.952 --> 00:42:37.955 region:rollup2
STUDENT OVER TIME OF TUITION AND

00:42:36.788 --> 00:42:39.824 region:rollup2
FEES HAVE TENDED TO BE A

00:42:37.955 --> 00:42:41.092 region:rollup2
SOMEWHAT MORE --

00:42:39.824 --> 00:42:43.561 region:rollup2
A STABLE REVENUE SOURCE FOR THE

00:42:41.092 --> 00:42:45.563 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITIES.

00:42:43.561 --> 00:42:46.197 region:rollup2
AND SECONDLY IN TERMS A MIX OF

00:42:45.563 --> 00:42:47.665 region:rollup2
CORE FUNDING --

00:42:46.197 --> 00:42:49.333 region:rollup2
BETWEEN STATE GENERAL FUND AND

00:42:47.665 --> 00:42:51.235 region:rollup2
STUDENT TUITION AND FEES.

00:42:49.333 --> 00:42:52.470 region:rollup2
BUT YOU'LL NOTICE THAT OVER TIME

00:42:51.235 --> 00:42:53.538 region:rollup2
STUDENT TUITION AND FEES HAVE

00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:54.572 region:rollup2
BECOME INCREASING SHARE OF CORE

00:42:53.538 --> 00:42:56.340 region:rollup2
FUNDING.

00:42:54.572 --> 00:42:58.843 region:rollup2
NOW THAT SAID.

00:42:56.340 --> 00:43:00.378 region:rollup2
A WE WOULD NOTE THAT AS OF

00:42:58.843 --> 00:43:01.412 region:rollup2
TUITION AND FEES HAVE INCREASED

00:43:00.378 --> 00:43:02.947 region:rollup2
SO HAS FINANCIAL AID SPENDING

00:43:01.412 --> 00:43:04.282 region:rollup2
AND YOU'LL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY.

00:43:02.947 --> 00:43:05.616 region:rollup2
TO LEARN MORE ABOUT FINANCIAL

00:43:04.282 --> 00:43:06.884 region:rollup2
AID IN YOUR NEXT PANEL.

00:43:05.616 --> 00:43:08.486 region:rollup2
A BUT AS YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE

00:43:06.884 --> 00:43:10.488 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN TUITION FEES OVER

00:43:08.486 --> 00:43:12.356 region:rollup2
TIME I KEEP IN MIND THAT SOME OF

00:43:10.488 --> 00:43:13.224 region:rollup2
THAT IS A GENUINE COST INCREASE

00:43:12.356 --> 00:43:14.559 region:rollup2
FOR CERTAIN CALIFORNIANS AND

00:43:13.224 --> 00:43:16.227 region:rollup2
HOUSEHOLDS.

00:43:14.559 --> 00:43:17.161 region:rollup2
BUT OTHER OTHER PORTIONS OF THAT

00:43:16.227 --> 00:43:18.629 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE STATE

00:43:17.161 --> 00:43:19.130 region:rollup2
OR BEEN REDIRECTED BACK TO

00:43:18.629 --> 00:43:21.399 region:rollup2
STUDENTS IN THE FORM OF

00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:23.568 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL AID.

00:43:21.399 --> 00:43:26.204 region:rollup2
IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TWO I WE

00:43:23.568 --> 00:43:27.438 region:rollup2
PROVIDE A A GRAPH THAT YOU SAW

00:43:26.204 --> 00:43:29.073 region:rollup2
SIMILAR TO THE COMMUNITY

00:43:27.438 --> 00:43:31.309 region:rollup2
COLLEGES PREFER CSCO.

00:43:29.073 --> 00:43:31.909 region:rollup2
AT SHOW STATE OF FUNDING AND A

00:43:31.309 --> 00:43:32.877 region:rollup2
STUDENT TUITION AND FEES OVER

00:43:31.909 --> 00:43:34.178 region:rollup2
TIME.

00:43:32.877 --> 00:43:35.246 region:rollup2
AND HERE AGAIN YOU CAN SEE A LOT

00:43:34.178 --> 00:43:36.247 region:rollup2
OF THE TRENDS ARE HIGHLIGHTED

00:43:35.246 --> 00:43:36.781 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S BEEN

00:43:36.247 --> 00:43:38.082 region:rollup2
SOMEWHAT VOLATILE OVER THE

00:43:36.781 --> 00:43:40.485 region:rollup2
YEARS.

00:43:38.082 --> 00:43:42.320 region:rollup2
I WAS CERTAIN PEAK SUCH AS IN

00:43:40.485 --> 00:43:44.122 region:rollup2
THE LATE EIGHTIES AND ALSO IN

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:45.790 region:rollup2
THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS FOLLOWED

00:43:44.122 --> 00:43:46.524 region:rollup2
BY A DECLINES IN PER STUDENT

00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:48.059 region:rollup2
FUNDING.

00:43:46.524 --> 00:43:49.327 region:rollup2
GENERALLY CORRESPONDING TWO

00:43:48.059 --> 00:43:50.761 region:rollup2
YEARS WERE THEIR RECESSIONS ARE

00:43:49.327 --> 00:43:51.896 region:rollup2
THERE WERE BUDGET REDUCTIONS AND

00:43:50.761 --> 00:43:52.864 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SEE A LOT OF THAT

00:43:51.896 --> 00:43:54.532 region:rollup2
VOLATILITY IS BENT ON THE STATE

00:43:52.864 --> 00:43:56.200 region:rollup2
FUNDING SIDE.

00:43:54.532 --> 00:43:57.668 region:rollup2
LIKEWISE YOU CAN ALSO SEE THAT

00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:58.703 region:rollup2
TUITION AND FEES OVER TIME HAVE

00:43:57.668 --> 00:43:59.904 region:rollup2
BEEN AN INCREASING SHARE OF CORE

00:43:58.703 --> 00:44:01.639 region:rollup2
FUNDING.

00:43:59.904 --> 00:44:03.107 region:rollup2
AND ALSO TO CIRCLE BACK TO THAT

00:44:01.639 --> 00:44:05.877 region:rollup2
POINT AND MADE ON FINANCIAL AID

00:44:03.107 --> 00:44:06.978 region:rollup2
SPENDING AND TWENTY FIFTEEN

00:44:05.877 --> 00:44:08.880 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN ABOUT THREE THOUSAND

00:44:06.978 --> 00:44:10.181 region:rollup2
DOLLARS PER STUDENT OF THAT A

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:11.582 region:rollup2
STUDENT TUITION AND FEES LINE IS

00:44:10.181 --> 00:44:12.884 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY BEING REDIRECTED FOR

00:44:11.582 --> 00:44:14.151 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL AID EITHER.

00:44:12.884 --> 00:44:15.386 region:rollup2
BEING COVERED BY THE STATE'S CAL

00:44:14.151 --> 00:44:17.455 region:rollup2
GRANT PROGRAM WORKING BRAG

00:44:15.386 --> 00:44:18.456 region:rollup2
REDIRECTED BACK TO STUDENTS SO

00:44:17.455 --> 00:44:19.891 region:rollup2
THAT JUST GIVES YOU A SENSE OF

00:44:18.456 --> 00:44:21.425 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH OF THAT IS BEING BORNE

00:44:19.891 --> 00:44:22.760 region:rollup2
BY -- BY

00:44:21.425 --> 00:44:25.429 region:rollup2
STUDENTS VERSES AB HADN'T BEEN

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:26.831 region:rollup2
FOR FINANCIALLY PROGRAM.

00:44:25.429 --> 00:44:28.199 region:rollup2
IF YOU TURN TO PAGE THREE OF

00:44:26.831 --> 00:44:30.067 region:rollup2
THAT HAND OUT YOU'LL SEE A

00:44:28.199 --> 00:44:31.402 region:rollup2
SIMILAR TABLE FOR YOU SEE AGAIN

00:44:30.067 --> 00:44:32.703 region:rollup2
THE TRENDS ARE VERY SIMILAR

00:44:31.402 --> 00:44:34.772 region:rollup2
YOU'LL SEE A LOT OF A NOTABLE

00:44:32.703 --> 00:44:35.640 region:rollup2
VOLATILITY IN THE OVERALL LEVEL

00:44:34.772 --> 00:44:37.275 region:rollup2
OF CORE FUNDING.

00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:38.376 region:rollup2
AND YOU ALSO SEE AGAIN --

00:44:37.275 --> 00:44:39.644 region:rollup2
THE INCREASING SHARE OF STUDENT

00:44:38.376 --> 00:44:41.979 region:rollup2
TUITION AND FEES AND AND

00:44:39.644 --> 00:44:43.581 region:rollup2
COVERING COR FUNDS.

00:44:41.979 --> 00:44:45.917 region:rollup2
AGAIN JUST A CIRCLE BACK TO THAT

00:44:43.581 --> 00:44:46.551 region:rollup2
POINT ON FINANCIAL AID ABOUT

00:44:45.917 --> 00:44:48.186 region:rollup2
SEVENTY FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS PER

00:44:46.551 --> 00:44:49.420 region:rollup2
STUDENT --

00:44:48.186 --> 00:44:50.454 region:rollup2
AND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN IS IN THE IN

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:52.456 region:rollup2
THE STUDENTS TO IT AND FEES

00:44:50.454 --> 00:44:53.491 region:rollup2
CATEGORY IS ACTUALLY BEING USED

00:44:52.456 --> 00:44:54.692 region:rollup2
FOR FINANCIAL AID EITHER THROUGH

00:44:53.491 --> 00:44:56.093 region:rollup2
THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM ARE BEING

00:44:54.692 --> 00:44:59.797 region:rollup2
REDIRECTED BACK TO STUDENTS FOR

00:44:56.093 --> 00:45:00.565 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL AID.

00:44:59.797 --> 00:45:02.099 region:rollup2
TURNING TO PAGE FOUR OF THE

00:45:00.565 --> 00:45:03.367 region:rollup2
HANDOUT WE PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW

00:45:02.099 --> 00:45:06.571 region:rollup2
OF SOME OF THE CHANGES IN THE

00:45:03.367 --> 00:45:08.573 region:rollup2
WAYS THE STATE HAS BUDGETED.

00:45:06.571 --> 00:45:09.574 region:rollup2
I THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS IN THE

00:45:08.573 --> 00:45:10.775 region:rollup2
NINETEEN SIXTIES OUR OUR

00:45:09.574 --> 00:45:12.476 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE BUDGET

00:45:10.775 --> 00:45:14.612 region:rollup2
PROCESS WAS A LOT MORE FORMULA

00:45:12.476 --> 00:45:16.547 region:rollup2
DRIVEN --

00:45:14.612 --> 00:45:17.415 region:rollup2
THE EVER EVER EVER NEW STUDENT

00:45:16.547 --> 00:45:18.983 region:rollup2
THAT THE UNIVERSITIES AND ROLL

00:45:17.415 --> 00:45:21.552 region:rollup2
THEY'VE GOT A CERTAIN SUBSIDY

00:45:18.983 --> 00:45:22.853 region:rollup2
FOR THAT NEW STUDENTS --

00:45:21.552 --> 00:45:24.855 region:rollup2
THERE WERE ADDITIONAL --

00:45:22.853 --> 00:45:25.456 region:rollup2
FUNDS FOR VARIOUS COST INCREASES

00:45:24.855 --> 00:45:27.558 region:rollup2
SUCH AS COMPENSATION INCREASES

00:45:25.456 --> 00:45:28.793 region:rollup2
--

00:45:27.558 --> 00:45:29.860 region:rollup2
ANYTIME THERE IS A NEW PROGRAM

00:45:28.793 --> 00:45:31.495 region:rollup2
ADDED THERE IS ADDITIONAL

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:33.864 region:rollup2
FUNDING FOR THAT.

00:45:31.495 --> 00:45:35.366 region:rollup2
AND EVERY AND FOR CERTAIN

00:45:33.864 --> 00:45:37.168 region:rollup2
FACILITY PROJECTS EVERY TIME

00:45:35.366 --> 00:45:38.469 region:rollup2
THERE IS A NEW FACILITY THAT WAS

00:45:37.168 --> 00:45:39.637 region:rollup2
PROPOSED AND ADOPTED IN THE

00:45:38.469 --> 00:45:40.171 region:rollup2
BUDGET THERE WAS FUNDING TO

00:45:39.637 --> 00:45:42.073 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THAT NEW FACILITY

00:45:40.171 --> 00:45:43.040 region:rollup2
PROJECT.

00:45:42.073 --> 00:45:44.008 region:rollup2
BEGIN IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES A

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:46.110 region:rollup2
LOT OF THIS FORMULA DRIVEN

00:45:44.008 --> 00:45:47.745 region:rollup2
APPROACH --

00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:49.780 region:rollup2
STARTED TO DECLINE AND AND

00:45:47.745 --> 00:45:50.247 region:rollup2
GIVEAWAYS TO A MORE FLEXIBLE

00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:52.083 region:rollup2
BUDGET PROCESS FOR THE

00:45:50.247 --> 00:45:54.285 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY'S.

00:45:52.083 --> 00:45:55.219 region:rollup2
OF AN EVOLVING A MORE NEGOTIATED

00:45:54.285 --> 00:45:57.388 region:rollup2
PROCESS BETWEEN THE LEVEL OF

00:45:55.219 --> 00:45:59.390 region:rollup2
SUPPORT --

00:45:57.388 --> 00:46:01.158 region:rollup2
AND ALSO IT AND IN DOING SO THE

00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:02.326 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE A DEFAULT A LOT OF

00:46:01.158 --> 00:46:04.161 region:rollup2
THAT A CONTROL IT HAD OVER THE

00:46:02.326 --> 00:46:05.029 region:rollup2
BUDGETS REALLY GAVE MORE CONTROL

00:46:04.161 --> 00:46:06.097 region:rollup2
AND RESPONSIBILITY TO THE

00:46:05.029 --> 00:46:07.865 region:rollup2
SEGMENTS TO MANAGE THEIR COST

00:46:06.097 --> 00:46:08.766 region:rollup2
INCREASES.

00:46:07.865 --> 00:46:10.201 region:rollup2
SO FOR EXAMPLE FOR ENROLLMENT

00:46:08.766 --> 00:46:12.169 region:rollup2
GROWTH OF THE OLD ENROLLMENT

00:46:10.201 --> 00:46:13.604 region:rollup2
FORMULAS WERE VERY DETAILED AND

00:46:12.169 --> 00:46:14.672 region:rollup2
PROVIDE A DIFFERENT DIFFERENT

00:46:13.604 --> 00:46:16.574 region:rollup2
SUBSIDIES DEPENDING ON IF THE

00:46:14.672 --> 00:46:17.274 region:rollup2
STUDENT WAS AN UNDERGRADUATE OR

00:46:16.574 --> 00:46:18.109 region:rollup2
GRADUATE.

00:46:17.274 --> 00:46:19.377 region:rollup2
AND ARE STANDING IS IN SOME

00:46:18.109 --> 00:46:21.245 region:rollup2
CASES EVEN IF THE STUDENT WAS

00:46:19.377 --> 00:46:23.681 region:rollup2
ENROLLED IN A CERTAIN DISCIPLINE

00:46:21.245 --> 00:46:24.882 region:rollup2
LIKE AT SCIENCE OR HUMANITY.

00:46:23.681 --> 00:46:26.250 region:rollup2
ON IN THE MID NINETIES THE

00:46:24.882 --> 00:46:27.652 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE REVISE THAT A

00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:29.553 region:rollup2
FORMULA AND CREATED A MUCH

00:46:27.652 --> 00:46:30.888 region:rollup2
SIMPLER FORMULA FOR BOTH SYSTEMS

00:46:29.553 --> 00:46:32.356 region:rollup2
THAT PROVIDED ONE SUBSIDY FOR

00:46:30.888 --> 00:46:33.557 region:rollup2
STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR

00:46:32.356 --> 00:46:35.226 region:rollup2
UNDERGRADUATES AND GRADUATES.

00:46:33.557 --> 00:46:36.027 region:rollup2
THEY GIVE THE SECOND MORE

00:46:35.226 --> 00:46:37.695 region:rollup2
CONTROL TO MANAGE ROMANS ACROSS

00:46:36.027 --> 00:46:38.996 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEMS.

00:46:37.695 --> 00:46:40.931 region:rollup2
AND IN CERTAIN YEARS THE STATE

00:46:38.996 --> 00:46:42.700 region:rollup2
HAS NOT SET ROMAN TARGETS IN THE

00:46:40.931 --> 00:46:44.001 region:rollup2
BUDGET OR DESIGNATED FUNDING

00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:46.103 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY FOR ENROLLMENT

00:46:44.001 --> 00:46:47.638 region:rollup2
GROWTH I MET ALSO GIVES PUTS

00:46:46.103 --> 00:46:49.040 region:rollup2
MORE RESPONSIBILITY ON THE

00:46:47.638 --> 00:46:50.341 region:rollup2
SEGMENTS TO REALLY.

00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:52.843 region:rollup2
SET THAT AS A PRIORITY OF

00:46:50.341 --> 00:46:54.378 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES.

00:46:52.843 --> 00:46:55.813 region:rollup2
LIKEWISE FOR OTHER EXPERT OF

00:46:54.378 --> 00:46:56.314 region:rollup2
COST INCREASES ARE NOT RELATED

00:46:55.813 --> 00:46:58.049 region:rollup2
TO ENROLLMENT SUCH AS

00:46:56.314 --> 00:46:59.550 region:rollup2
COMPENSATION COSTS IN RECENT

00:46:58.049 --> 00:47:00.484 region:rollup2
YEARS A LOT OF THE OF THE

00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:02.153 region:rollup2
SEGMENTS HAVE BEEN EXPECTED TO

00:47:00.484 --> 00:47:04.322 region:rollup2
COVER THOSE COSTS THROUGH.

00:47:02.153 --> 00:47:05.122 region:rollup2
A GENERAL PURPOSE BASED

PARTICULARLY AT IN RECENT YEARS

00:47:10.995 --> 00:47:13.497 region:rollup2
IT'S BEEN VERY MUCH THAT

LIKEWISE FOR VARIOUS PROGRAMS ON

00:47:26.644 --> 00:47:29.080 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THE CATEGORICAL

PROGRAMS THAT EXISTED IN THE

00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:32.616 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS --

THROUGHOUT THE SIXTIES AND

00:47:32.616 --> 00:47:35.286 region:rollup2
SEVENTIES ALSO THAT WERE ADDED

00:47:33.751 --> 00:47:36.754 region:rollup2
IN TWO THOUSANDS A LOT OF THOSE

00:47:35.286 --> 00:47:38.889 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS ARE FOLDED INTO THE

THOSE PLOT OF THIS PROGRAM STILL

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:45.596 region:rollup2
EXIST BUT THE FUNDING IS NOW IN

00:47:44.361 --> 00:47:47.965 region:rollup2
THE CONTROL OF THE SEGMENTS OF

00:47:45.596 --> 00:47:49.033 region:rollup2
THE SEGMENTS REALLY RESPONSIBLE

00:47:47.965 --> 00:47:49.800 region:rollup2
FOR ALLOCATING FUNDS TO THOSE

00:47:49.033 --> 00:47:52.203 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS IN REVIEWING THEIR

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:53.938 region:rollup2
CONTINUE NEED.

00:47:52.203 --> 00:47:56.006 region:rollup2
AND THEN FOR FACILITIES OF THE

00:47:53.938 --> 00:47:57.374 region:rollup2
STATE AS A FEW YEARS AGO A

00:47:56.006 --> 00:47:58.843 region:rollup2
REVISED THE WAY IT IT --

00:47:57.374 --> 00:48:00.044 region:rollup2
REVIEWS FACILITIES AND IT GIVES

00:47:58.843 --> 00:48:02.079 region:rollup2
A LOT MORE GIVE A LOT MORE

00:48:00.044 --> 00:48:03.381 region:rollup2
CONTROL OF THE SEGMENTS. TO

00:48:02.079 --> 00:48:05.015 region:rollup2
APPROVE NEW FACILITY PROJECTS AS

00:48:03.381 --> 00:48:05.416 region:rollup2
PART OF THAT PROCESS ALSO GAVE

00:48:05.015 --> 00:48:06.550 region:rollup2
THE SEGMENTS MORE

00:48:05.416 --> 00:48:10.721 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY.

00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:12.623 region:rollup2
FUND THOSE NEW PROJECTS.

00:48:10.721 --> 00:48:13.991 region:rollup2
NOW IN ADDITION TO THAT TREND --

00:48:12.623 --> 00:48:15.559 region:rollup2
I ALSO WANTED TO NOTE THAT I'M

00:48:13.991 --> 00:48:17.094 region:rollup2
YOU'VE HEARD SOME DISCUSSION

00:48:15.559 --> 00:48:18.162 region:rollup2
ABOUT PERFORMANCE BASED

00:48:17.094 --> 00:48:19.997 region:rollup2
BUDGETING IN THE COMMUNITY

00:48:18.162 --> 00:48:21.932 region:rollup2
COLLEGES SOMEWHAT DISCUSSION IS

00:48:19.997 --> 00:48:23.300 region:rollup2
ALSO EXISTED IN OF ON THE

00:48:21.932 --> 00:48:24.602 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY SIDE.

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:27.605 region:rollup2
OTHER STATE FEW YEARS AGO

00:48:24.602 --> 00:48:28.973 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED PERFORMANCE MEASURES

00:48:27.605 --> 00:48:29.940 region:rollup2
THAT THE UNIVERSITIES MUST

00:48:28.973 --> 00:48:31.041 region:rollup2
REPORT ON EACH YEAR THE

00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:33.077 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE MEASURES.

00:48:31.041 --> 00:48:35.079 region:rollup2
LIKE GRADUATION RATES LOWER O.

00:48:33.077 --> 00:48:36.046 region:rollup2
INCOME STUDENT ENROLLMENT THE

00:48:35.079 --> 00:48:37.615 region:rollup2
UNITS THAT STUDENTS ACCUMULATE

00:48:36.046 --> 00:48:39.350 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY GRADUATE OTHER VARIOUS

00:48:37.615 --> 00:48:40.017 region:rollup2
MEASURES OF THAT SORT.

00:48:39.350 --> 00:48:42.653 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY THE SEGMENTS REPORT ON

00:48:40.017 --> 00:48:44.021 region:rollup2
THOSE PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND

00:48:42.653 --> 00:48:46.157 region:rollup2
ITS INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE

00:48:44.021 --> 00:48:47.658 region:rollup2
BUDGET SUB COMMITTEES --

00:48:46.157 --> 00:48:48.893 region:rollup2
UNLIKE THE NEW COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:48:47.658 --> 00:48:49.527 region:rollup2
FORMULA THOSE PERFORMANCE

00:48:48.893 --> 00:48:51.095 region:rollup2
MEASURES AREN'T REALLY

00:48:49.527 --> 00:48:52.830 region:rollup2
INTEGRATED ANY SORT OF BUDGET

00:48:51.095 --> 00:48:54.331 region:rollup2
FORMULA OR ANY OTHER SORT OF WAY

00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:54.965 region:rollup2
WE BUDGET FOR THEM THEY'RE

00:48:54.331 --> 00:48:58.235 region:rollup2
THEY'RE SORT OF INFORMATIONAL AT

00:48:54.965 --> 00:49:00.404 region:rollup2
THIS POINT.

00:48:58.235 --> 00:49:01.705 region:rollup2
SO SKIPPING ACTUALLY HERB PITCH

00:49:00.404 --> 00:49:02.873 region:rollup2
FIVE MOVING TO PAGE SIX FOR THE

00:49:01.705 --> 00:49:05.075 region:rollup2
SAKE OF TIME.

00:49:02.873 --> 00:49:06.443 region:rollup2
I'M ONE OF THE TOUCH ON SOME KEY

00:49:05.075 --> 00:49:07.445 region:rollup2
AREAS FOR YOU TO CONSIDER AS A

00:49:06.443 --> 00:49:09.880 region:rollup2
REVIEWING BUDGET PRACTICES FOR

00:49:07.445 --> 00:49:10.848 region:rollup2
THE UNIVERSITIES --

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:11.749 region:rollup2
MY COLLEAGUE PAUL ALREADY

00:49:10.848 --> 00:49:13.050 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED.

00:49:11.749 --> 00:49:14.952 region:rollup2
THAT FIRST POINT ABOUT SETTING

00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:16.754 region:rollup2
AN OVERALL RESERVE JUST AS THAT

00:49:14.952 --> 00:49:18.355 region:rollup2
MIGHT CONTROL SOME VOLATILITY

00:49:16.754 --> 00:49:19.757 region:rollup2
FOR THE COLLEGES ALSO CONTROLS

00:49:18.355 --> 00:49:21.091 region:rollup2
IT IT COULD HELP YOU SOME OF THE

00:49:19.757 --> 00:49:23.828 region:rollup2
VOLATILITY FOR THE UNIVERSITY

00:49:21.091 --> 00:49:25.396 region:rollup2
SEGMENTS.

00:49:23.828 --> 00:49:26.797 region:rollup2
AND SECONDLY AS YOU'RE THINKING

00:49:25.396 --> 00:49:28.632 region:rollup2
ABOUT BUDGETING YOU MAY WISH TO

00:49:26.797 --> 00:49:29.867 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT WAYS THAT OF THE

00:49:28.632 --> 00:49:30.901 region:rollup2
STATE HAS BUDGETED FOR THE

00:49:29.867 --> 00:49:32.403 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY SEGMENTS IN THE PRO

00:49:30.901 --> 00:49:33.904 region:rollup2
AND THE APPROACH THAT YOU THINK

00:49:32.403 --> 00:49:35.406 region:rollup2
MAKES MOST SENSE TO YOU.

00:49:33.904 --> 00:49:36.474 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT THE OLD FORMULA

00:49:35.406 --> 00:49:37.808 region:rollup2
DRIVEN APPROACH MADE SENSE OF

00:49:36.474 --> 00:49:40.044 region:rollup2
WHETHER THE CURRENTLY THEM MORE

00:49:37.808 --> 00:49:41.846 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATED --

00:49:40.044 --> 00:49:43.347 region:rollup2
SYSTEM MAKES SENSE AND IN DOING

00:49:41.846 --> 00:49:44.515 region:rollup2
SO YOU MAY WISH TO REVIEW WHAT

00:49:43.347 --> 00:49:47.384 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF CONTROL YOU'D LIKE TO

00:49:44.515 --> 00:49:48.285 region:rollup2
EXERT OVER THE UNIVERSITY'S.

00:49:47.384 --> 00:49:49.520 region:rollup2
OUR STATE OTHER AS YOUR BUDGET

00:49:48.285 --> 00:49:51.088 region:rollup2
ADVISER.

00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:52.556 region:rollup2
WE WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO

00:49:51.088 --> 00:49:54.458 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:49:52.556 --> 00:49:55.492 region:rollup2
HAS A KEY ROLE IN SHAPING THE

00:49:54.458 --> 00:49:57.228 region:rollup2
PRIORITIES IN THE BUDGET

00:49:55.492 --> 00:49:58.195 region:rollup2
PRIORITIES OF THE SEGMENTS.

00:49:57.228 --> 00:49:59.463 region:rollup2
I'M SO THE UESTION FOR YOU IS

00:49:58.195 --> 00:50:00.798 region:rollup2
REALLY HOW MUCH CONTROL YOU LIKE

OVER THESE VERY VERY VERY

00:50:00.798 --> 00:50:03.667 region:rollup2
SERIOUS HOW MUCH CONTROL YOU

00:50:01.966 --> 00:50:04.635 region:rollup2
LIKE OVER SETTING ENROLLMENT

00:50:03.667 --> 00:50:07.071 region:rollup2
TARGETS.

00:50:04.635 --> 00:50:08.372 region:rollup2
REVIEWING COMPENSATION LEVELS.

00:50:07.071 --> 00:50:10.074 region:rollup2
AND POSSIBLY REVIEWS IT RIP

00:50:08.372 --> 00:50:11.475 region:rollup2
REVIEWING OTHER POLICIES TO FOR

00:50:10.074 --> 00:50:12.610 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE VERY

00:50:11.475 --> 00:50:14.111 region:rollup2
RECENTLY HAS USED THE BUDGET

00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:15.279 region:rollup2
PROCESS TO REVIEW THINGS LIKE

00:50:14.111 --> 00:50:16.747 region:rollup2
NON RESIDENT ROLE MEANT.

00:50:15.279 --> 00:50:18.682 region:rollup2

OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT'S OTHERS

00:50:22.653 --> 00:50:24.922 region:rollup2
ARE SOME WAYS THAT THE

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:26.223 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE HAS --

00:50:24.922 --> 00:50:29.960 region:rollup2
TRY TO RE EXERT SOME CONTROL

00:50:26.223 --> 00:50:31.295 region:rollup2
OVER THE BUDGET PROCESS --

00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:32.663 region:rollup2
OFFER REGARDING PERFORMANCE A

00:50:31.295 --> 00:50:34.098 region:rollup2
BASED BUDGETING YOU MAY WISH TO

00:50:32.663 --> 00:50:36.333 region:rollup2
CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT THE

00:50:34.098 --> 00:50:38.035 region:rollup2
CURRENT SYSTEM WHICH IT SEGMENTS

00:50:36.333 --> 00:50:39.537 region:rollup2
REPORT INFORMATION.

00:50:38.035 --> 00:50:41.071 region:rollup2
IS REASONABLE OR WHETHER OR NOT

00:50:39.537 --> 00:50:42.539 region:rollup2
OF THE LEGISLATURE OUGHT TO DO

00:50:41.071 --> 00:50:44.041 region:rollup2
MORE.

00:50:42.539 --> 00:50:44.542 region:rollup2
TO INTEGRATE PERFORMANCE

00:50:44.041 --> 00:50:47.111 region:rollup2
MEASURES INTO THE BUDGET

00:50:44.542 --> 00:50:48.479 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

00:50:47.111 --> 00:50:49.980 region:rollup2
AND THEN FINALLY THE LEGISLATURE

00:50:48.479 --> 00:50:51.582 region:rollup2
FACES THE PERENNIAL ISSUE OF HOW

00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:53.083 region:rollup2
TO SHARE COSTS BETWEEN THE STATE

00:50:51.582 --> 00:50:54.552 region:rollup2
AND STUDENTS WHAT SO BUT LOOK

00:50:53.083 --> 00:50:55.686 region:rollup2
PORTION OF THIS OF COURSE FUND

00:50:54.552 --> 00:50:56.754 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY THE STATE

00:50:55.686 --> 00:50:57.988 region:rollup2
WHAT PORTION SHOULD BE SUPPORTED

00:50:56.754 --> 00:50:59.857 region:rollup2
BY STUDENTS.

00:50:57.988 --> 00:51:01.292 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZING THAT FINANCIAL AID

00:50:59.857 --> 00:51:01.792 region:rollup2
DOES COVER THE COSTS FOR

00:51:01.292 --> 00:51:03.193 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WHO QUALIFY FOR

SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS IN HOW WE

00:52:01.218 --> 00:52:05.656 region:rollup2
FINANCE HIGHER EDUCATION.

00:52:04.221 --> 00:52:08.158 region:rollup2
THE COLLEGE FUTURES FOUNDATION

00:52:05.656 --> 00:52:09.426 region:rollup2
BEGAN EXAMINING COLLEGE FINANCE

00:52:08.158 --> 00:52:10.828 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF GROWING CONCERNS AT

00:52:09.426 --> 00:52:13.063 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM OF PAIN FOR HIGHER

00:52:10.828 --> 00:52:14.465 region:rollup2
EDUCATION HAS BECOME A BARRIER

00:52:13.063 --> 00:52:15.666 region:rollup2
TO INCREASING BACHELOR DEGREE

00:52:14.465 --> 00:52:17.534 region:rollup2
ATTAINMENT.

00:52:15.666 --> 00:52:19.570 region:rollup2
AMONG ALL STUDENTS AND HAS

00:52:17.534 --> 00:52:20.771 region:rollup2
BECOME PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING

00:52:19.570 --> 00:52:22.506 region:rollup2
FOR LOW INCOME AND FIRST

00:52:20.771 --> 00:52:24.174 region:rollup2
GENERATION STUDENTS.

00:52:22.506 --> 00:52:25.876 region:rollup2
THIS LET US TO WORK ON THE TOPIC

00:52:24.174 --> 00:52:27.945 region:rollup2
OF HIGHER ED FINANCE TO BETTER

00:52:25.876 --> 00:52:29.680 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE ELEMENTS AND THE

00:52:27.945 --> 00:52:31.682 region:rollup2
ISSUES AND WAYS TO EXPLORE

00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:33.784 region:rollup2
SOLVING IT.

00:52:31.682 --> 00:52:35.653 region:rollup2
OUR PRIMARY FOCUS HAS BEEN ON

00:52:33.784 --> 00:52:37.154 region:rollup2
THE CSU AND THE UC WHICH

00:52:35.653 --> 00:52:38.088 region:rollup2
EDUCATES NEARLY THREE QUARTERS

00:52:37.154 --> 00:52:39.790 region:rollup2
OF THE STATE'S BACCALAUREATE

00:52:38.088 --> 00:52:41.225 region:rollup2
RECIPIENTS.

00:52:39.790 --> 00:52:42.292 region:rollup2
OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS WE HAVE

00:52:41.225 --> 00:52:44.628 region:rollup2
CONVENED A SERIES OF

00:52:42.292 --> 00:52:46.163 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS AMONG INDIVIDUALS

00:52:44.628 --> 00:52:48.198 region:rollup2
WITH DEEP EXPERTISE ON PUBLIC

00:52:46.163 --> 00:52:49.800 region:rollup2
POLICY AND HIGHER ED FINANCE.

00:52:48.198 --> 00:52:51.802 region:rollup2
AND COMMISSION SIGNIFICANT

00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:53.003 region:rollup2
AMOUNTS OF RESEARCH MY COMMENTS

00:52:51.802 --> 00:52:55.205 region:rollup2
AND RECOMMENDATIONS ARE A

00:52:53.003 --> 00:52:57.841 region:rollup2
REFLECTION OF THIS ANALYSIS AND

00:52:55.205 --> 00:52:59.643 region:rollup2
THE EXPLORATION OF THE ISSUES.

00:52:57.841 --> 00:53:01.111 region:rollup2
A GROWING CONCERN.

00:52:59.643 --> 00:53:02.880 region:rollup2
THE HIGHER IT FINANCE PROBLEM

00:53:01.111 --> 00:53:04.448 region:rollup2
HAS WORSENED OVER THE LAST

00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:06.517 region:rollup2
THIRTY YEARS BECAUSE OF GROWING

00:53:04.448 --> 00:53:08.052 region:rollup2
STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE BETWEEN

00:53:06.517 --> 00:53:09.520 region:rollup2
REVENUES AND SPENDING.

00:53:08.052 --> 00:53:11.955 region:rollup2
AS WE HEARD HIM FLUSH ECONOMIC

00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:14.124 region:rollup2
TIMES THE STATE CAMPAIGN MORE

00:53:11.955 --> 00:53:15.959 region:rollup2
TUITIONS HOLD STEADY AND COLLEGE

00:53:14.124 --> 00:53:17.861 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT IS EASIER IN BAD

00:53:15.959 --> 00:53:20.197 region:rollup2
TIMES THE STATUS FORCED TO MAKE

00:53:17.861 --> 00:53:21.432 region:rollup2
DRASTIC BUDGET CUTS INSTITUTIONS

00:53:20.197 --> 00:53:23.333 region:rollup2
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS

00:53:21.432 --> 00:53:25.135 region:rollup2
WHO CAN BE ADMITTED.

00:53:23.333 --> 00:53:27.304 region:rollup2
AND TUITION SKYROCKET.

00:53:25.135 --> 00:53:29.173 region:rollup2
WHEN GOOD TIMES RETURN SPENDING

00:53:27.304 --> 00:53:30.874 region:rollup2
INCREASES AGAIN INTUITIONS ARE

00:53:29.173 --> 00:53:33.077 region:rollup2
HELD STEADY BUT NOTHING

00:53:30.874 --> 00:53:34.678 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGES SO WHEN

00:53:33.077 --> 00:53:36.513 region:rollup2
THE NEXT RECESSION ROLLS AROUND?

00:53:34.678 --> 00:53:38.115 region:rollup2
THE CYCLE THE BUDGET CUTS

00:53:36.513 --> 00:53:40.317 region:rollup2
TUITION INCREASES AND ENROLLMENT

00:53:38.115 --> 00:53:42.219 region:rollup2
COMEBACK CUT BACKS REPEAT.

00:53:40.317 --> 00:53:44.955 region:rollup2
NO ONE IS WELL SERVED BY THIS

00:53:42.219 --> 00:53:46.523 region:rollup2
WILD RIDE OF HIGHS AND LOWS NOT

00:53:44.955 --> 00:53:48.692 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA FAMILIES NOT THE

00:53:46.523 --> 00:53:50.327 region:rollup2
STATE NOT THE INSTITUTIONS OR

THE PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR THEM AND

00:53:50.327 --> 00:53:54.398 region:rollup2
MOST PARTICULARLY.

00:53:51.628 --> 00:53:55.766 region:rollup2
NOT STUDENTS WE MUST FIND A

00:53:54.398 --> 00:53:57.901 region:rollup2
BETTER WAY TO MANAGE HIGHER

00:53:55.766 --> 00:53:58.969 region:rollup2

00:53:58.969 --> 00:54:03.173 region:rollup2
AND TUITION BY TAKING ON

00:54:01.538 --> 00:54:05.175 region:rollup2
PREDICTABILITY OF REVENUES

ADOPTED BUDGET BY OFFERING

00:54:05.175 --> 00:54:10.247 region:rollup2

00:54:07.277 --> 00:54:13.150 region:rollup2
CROSSED MANAGED COST MANAGEMENT.

00:54:10.247 --> 00:54:15.052 region:rollup2
BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS.

00:54:13.150 --> 00:54:16.653 region:rollup2
WE SEE FOR ASPECTS TO THE

00:54:15.052 --> 00:54:18.422 region:rollup2
FINANCE CHALLENGES FACING

00:54:16.653 --> 00:54:20.124 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITIES.

00:54:18.422 --> 00:54:22.593 region:rollup2
VOLATILE REVENUE PATTERNS

00:54:20.124 --> 00:54:24.094 region:rollup2
INCLUDING STRETCHES OF DECLINING

00:54:22.593 --> 00:54:25.395 region:rollup2
STATE GENERAL FUND REVENUES

00:54:24.094 --> 00:54:27.197 region:rollup2
LINKED WITH GROWING DEPENDENCE

00:54:25.395 --> 00:54:29.566 region:rollup2
ON TUITION.

00:54:27.197 --> 00:54:32.369 region:rollup2
BUDGETING PRACTICES ASSOCIATED

00:54:29.566 --> 00:54:32.636 region:rollup2
WITH THE FIXED COSTS OF EMPLOYEE

00:54:32.369 --> 00:54:33.670 region:rollup2
BENEFITS.

00:54:32.636 --> 00:54:35.439 region:rollup2
ACADEMIC OR INSTRUCTIONAL COST

00:54:35.439 --> 00:54:39.343 region:rollup2
AND STATE AND INSTITUTIONAL

00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:41.211 region:rollup2
DECISION MAKING THAT FUNCTIONS

00:54:39.343 --> 00:54:44.181 region:rollup2
WITHOUT SHARED MEASURES COMMON

00:54:41.211 --> 00:54:46.150 region:rollup2
GOALS AND MUTUAL ACCOUNTABILITY.

00:54:44.181 --> 00:54:47.951 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE SOLUTIONS THAT REQUIRE

00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:50.053 region:rollup2
ATTENTION TO ALL FOUR OF THESE

00:54:47.951 --> 00:54:51.588 region:rollup2
BARRIERS BUT THOSE TIME LIMITS

00:54:50.053 --> 00:54:53.090 region:rollup2
THAT I HAVE I'M GOING TO FOCUS

00:54:51.588 --> 00:54:54.691 region:rollup2
ON THREE OF THEM.

00:54:53.090 --> 00:54:56.560 region:rollup2
REVENUE INSTABILITY COST

00:54:54.691 --> 00:54:58.462 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT AND TRANSPARENCY IN

00:54:56.560 --> 00:55:00.497 region:rollup2
DECISION MAKING FINALLY ARE

00:54:58.462 --> 00:55:01.265 region:rollup2
CLOSE WITH THE SHORT ANALYSIS

00:55:00.497 --> 00:55:02.332 region:rollup2
AND A DESCRIPTION OF THE

00:55:01.265 --> 00:55:04.001 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS.

00:55:02.332 --> 00:55:05.936 region:rollup2
OUR PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES FACE IN

00:55:04.001 --> 00:55:07.304 region:rollup2
TERMS OF CAPITAL FINANCE WHICH

00:55:05.936 --> 00:55:09.506 region:rollup2
WE MUST ADDRESS IF WE TO

00:55:07.304 --> 00:55:12.709 region:rollup2
ACCOMMODATE THE GROWING DEMAND

00:55:09.506 --> 00:55:13.010 region:rollup2
FOR POST SECONDARY EDUCATION

00:55:12.709 --> 00:55:14.778 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:55:13.010 --> 00:55:16.013 region:rollup2
REVENUE VOLATILITY.

00:55:14.778 --> 00:55:17.514 region:rollup2
AND A GROWING DEPENDENCE ON

00:55:16.013 --> 00:55:19.516 region:rollup2
TUITION THIS IS THE MOST WIDELY

00:55:17.514 --> 00:55:21.618 region:rollup2
DOCUMENTED AND BEST UNDERSTOOD

00:55:19.516 --> 00:55:22.820 region:rollup2
FAST OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION

00:55:21.618 --> 00:55:24.588 region:rollup2
FINANCE PROBLEM.

00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:27.124 region:rollup2
THE UNPREDICTABLE STATE REVENUE

00:55:24.588 --> 00:55:28.759 region:rollup2
LEVELS LINK TO INCREASES IN

00:55:27.124 --> 00:55:30.027 region:rollup2
TUITION BY UNIVERSITIES.

00:55:28.759 --> 00:55:32.029 region:rollup2
AS YOU'VE HEARD THE SOURCES OF

00:55:30.027 --> 00:55:34.331 region:rollup2
REVENUE IN CALIFORNIA'S GENERAL

00:55:32.029 --> 00:55:36.099 region:rollup2
FUND HAVE SHIFTED SUBSTANTIALLY

00:55:34.331 --> 00:55:38.335 region:rollup2
AND OF RECENT DECADES.

00:55:36.099 --> 00:55:40.604 region:rollup2
A PERSONAL INCOME TAX AND HIGH

00:55:38.335 --> 00:55:41.772 region:rollup2
INCOME TAXPAYER THE INCOME

00:55:40.604 --> 00:55:44.141 region:rollup2
EARNED BY THESE TAXPAYERS IS

00:55:41.772 --> 00:55:45.275 region:rollup2
MORE DEPENDENT ON CAPITAL GAINS

00:55:44.141 --> 00:55:47.244 region:rollup2
MAKING THE GENERAL FUND

00:55:45.275 --> 00:55:49.012 region:rollup2
DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED IN

00:55:47.244 --> 00:55:50.581 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC BOOMS AND BUSTS.

00:55:49.012 --> 00:55:52.716 region:rollup2
THIS WAS ABUNDANTLY CLEAR DURING

00:55:50.581 --> 00:55:55.586 region:rollup2
THE GREAT RECESSION WHEN STATE

00:55:52.716 --> 00:55:57.621 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY SHRANK 4% BUT

00:55:55.586 --> 00:55:59.723 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND REVENUES DECLINED

00:55:57.621 --> 00:56:01.992 region:rollup2
BY MORE THAN 19%.

00:55:59.723 --> 00:56:03.794 region:rollup2
AS GENERAL FUNDS DROP TUITION

00:56:01.992 --> 00:56:05.495 region:rollup2
STARTS TO STUDENTS INCREASED AND

00:56:03.794 --> 00:56:07.698 region:rollup2
TUITION IS NOW THE LARGEST

00:56:05.495 --> 00:56:10.634 region:rollup2
REVENUE SOURCE FOR CORE PROGRAMS

00:56:07.698 --> 00:56:12.135 region:rollup2
IN THE UC AND HALF OF COR

00:56:10.634 --> 00:56:14.137 region:rollup2
REVENUES AT THE CSU.

00:56:12.135 --> 00:56:16.540 region:rollup2
AND GIVEN THAT MAJOR TAX REFORM

00:56:14.137 --> 00:56:18.275 region:rollup2
IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY WE MUST FIND

00:56:16.540 --> 00:56:22.012 region:rollup2
WAYS TO BUFFER AGAINST THESE

00:56:18.275 --> 00:56:23.547 region:rollup2
INEVITABLE PRECIPITOUS DECLINES.

00:56:22.012 --> 00:56:25.349 region:rollup2
BUDGET AND PRACTICES ASSOCIATED

00:56:23.547 --> 00:56:27.251 region:rollup2
WITH FIXED COSTS.

00:56:25.349 --> 00:56:28.585 region:rollup2
BOTH STATE UNIVERSITY BUDGET

00:56:27.251 --> 00:56:30.921 region:rollup2
PRACTICES TREAT EMPLOYEE

00:56:28.585 --> 00:56:32.322 region:rollup2
BENEFITS AS FIXED COSTS WHICH

00:56:30.921 --> 00:56:34.057 region:rollup2
MEANS AIR FUNDED AHEAD OF OTHER

00:56:32.322 --> 00:56:35.626 region:rollup2
PRIORITIES.

00:56:34.057 --> 00:56:38.228 region:rollup2
EVEN AS REVENUE HAS BECOME LESS

00:56:35.626 --> 00:56:39.496 region:rollup2
PREDICTABLE A LARGER SHARE IS

00:56:38.228 --> 00:56:41.131 region:rollup2
NEEDED TO PAY FOR THE FIX

00:56:39.496 --> 00:56:41.698 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

00:56:41.131 --> 00:56:43.800 region:rollup2
PENSIONS AND RETIREE HEALTH

00:56:41.698 --> 00:56:45.602 region:rollup2
CARE.

00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:47.738 region:rollup2
BENEFIT LEVELS HAVE IMPROVED.

00:56:45.602 --> 00:56:50.474 region:rollup2
BUT THE PRIMARY COST DRIVER HAS

00:56:47.738 --> 00:56:52.142 region:rollup2
BEEN THE COST OF HEALTHCARE AND

00:56:50.474 --> 00:56:54.211 region:rollup2
CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING RULES THAT

00:56:52.142 --> 00:56:56.446 region:rollup2
NOW REQUIRE BENEFITS COMMITTED

00:56:54.211 --> 00:56:57.714 region:rollup2
TO BE RETIREES TO BE SHOWN AS

00:56:56.446 --> 00:56:59.316 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONAL LIVE BILL IT IS

00:56:57.714 --> 00:57:01.118 region:rollup2
OUR DEBTS.

00:56:59.316 --> 00:57:03.153 region:rollup2
PENSION GUARANTEES PENSION

00:57:01.118 --> 00:57:05.055 region:rollup2
BENEFITS ARE GUARANTEES AND

00:57:03.153 --> 00:57:06.923 region:rollup2
CANNOT BE REDUCED FOR EXISTING

00:57:05.055 --> 00:57:08.492 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES OUR RETIREES NOR WOULD

00:57:06.923 --> 00:57:10.227 region:rollup2
WE RECOMMEND THAT.

00:57:08.492 --> 00:57:11.928 region:rollup2
BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE

00:57:10.227 --> 00:57:13.063 region:rollup2
PROBLEM A SPENDING ON BENEFITS

00:57:11.928 --> 00:57:15.666 region:rollup2
IS WELL RECOGNIZED WITHIN

CALIFORNIA AND NATIONALLY AND

00:57:15.666 --> 00:57:19.236 region:rollup2
WHATEVER CHANGES THAT THAT NEED

00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:21.471 region:rollup2
TO HAPPEN MUST HAPPEN SLOWLY

00:57:19.236 --> 00:57:23.307 region:rollup2

STATE GOVERNMENT IN HIGHER

THE WAY FORWARD.

00:57:57.941 --> 00:58:01.211 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE

00:58:01.211 --> 00:58:04.715 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH.

00:58:03.213 --> 00:58:07.317 region:rollup2

00:58:10.887 --> 00:58:16.460 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS ARE REQUIRED. TO

00:58:13.523 --> 00:58:17.527 region:rollup2
ADDRESS ALL OF THESE.

00:58:16.460 --> 00:58:19.329 region:rollup2
REVENUE AND TUITION

00:58:17.527 --> 00:58:21.765 region:rollup2
PREDICTABILITY THE STATE HIGHER

00:58:19.329 --> 00:58:23.633 region:rollup2
EDUCATION SYSTEM SHOULD ADDRESS.

00:58:21.765 --> 00:58:26.069 region:rollup2
REVENUES MOVING TO REDUCE

00:58:23.633 --> 00:58:28.372 region:rollup2
VOLATILITY FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND

00:58:26.069 --> 00:58:30.240 region:rollup2
BUILD BETTER PREDICTABILITY FOR

00:58:28.372 --> 00:58:31.341 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONAL LEADERS.

00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:33.610 region:rollup2
THIS SHOULD OCCUR THROUGH A

00:58:31.341 --> 00:58:36.079 region:rollup2
COMBINATION OF MODERATE AND

00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:37.547 region:rollup2
PREDICTABLE INCREASES IN GENERAL

00:58:36.079 --> 00:58:39.049 region:rollup2
FUND SUPPORT FROM THE STATE.

00:58:37.547 --> 00:58:42.753 region:rollup2
MODERATE AND PREDICTABLE

00:58:39.049 --> 00:58:45.022 region:rollup2
INCREASES IN TUITION BY COHORT

00:58:42.753 --> 00:58:47.190 region:rollup2
ACCOMPANIED BY NEED BASED AID TO

00:58:45.022 --> 00:58:48.825 region:rollup2
PROTECT COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY

00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:51.194 region:rollup2
FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS.

00:58:48.825 --> 00:58:53.363 region:rollup2
AND INCREASES IN THE CONTINGENCY

00:58:51.194 --> 00:58:54.965 region:rollup2
RESERVES DEDICATED TO HIGHER

00:58:53.363 --> 00:58:56.633 region:rollup2
EDUCATION.

00:58:54.965 --> 00:58:59.136 region:rollup2
THE LONG STANDING HABIT OF

00:58:56.633 --> 00:59:01.204 region:rollup2
BUYING OUT TUITION IN GOOD TIMES

00:58:59.136 --> 00:59:04.107 region:rollup2
AND LETTING THE LEVEL SPIKE IN

00:59:01.204 --> 00:59:06.143 region:rollup2
RECESSIONS NATURE AND STUDENTS

00:59:04.107 --> 00:59:09.112 region:rollup2
THE INSTITUTIONS AND OUR STATE.

00:59:06.143 --> 00:59:11.148 region:rollup2
ARE BETTER SERVED THROUGH MODEST

00:59:09.112 --> 00:59:13.016 region:rollup2
AND PREDICTABLE ANNUAL INCREASES

00:59:11.148 --> 00:59:14.918 region:rollup2
IN TUITION.

00:59:13.016 --> 00:59:16.686 region:rollup2
MATCHED WITH SAME SIZE GROWTH IN

00:59:14.918 --> 00:59:18.755 region:rollup2
STATE FUNDING.

00:59:16.686 --> 00:59:20.190 region:rollup2
AND THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS

00:59:18.755 --> 00:59:21.925 region:rollup2
FOR EMPLOYEE BENEFITS SHOULD BE

00:59:20.190 --> 00:59:23.727 region:rollup2
AT REVISED TO INCREASE

00:59:21.925 --> 00:59:25.729 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY AND TO ILLUMINATE

00:59:23.727 --> 00:59:28.131 region:rollup2
TRADE OFFS BETWEEN SPENDING ON

00:59:25.729 --> 00:59:30.300 region:rollup2
BENEFITS AND OTHER OPTIONS.

00:59:28.131 --> 00:59:32.903 region:rollup2
INCLUDING SALARIES NEW FACULTY

00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:36.039 region:rollup2
POSITIONS LOWER INCREASES IN

00:59:32.903 --> 00:59:37.107 region:rollup2
STUDENT TUITIONS EXCEPT TRACK.

00:59:36.039 --> 00:59:39.609 region:rollup2
SO WE BELIEVE THAT A

00:59:37.107 --> 00:59:41.344 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE PROBLEM REQUIRES A

00:59:39.609 --> 00:59:43.680 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION AND

00:59:41.344 --> 00:59:45.549 region:rollup2
ILLUMINATING BOTH THE COST AND

00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:47.117 region:rollup2
THE REVENUE SIDE AND THE

00:59:45.549 --> 00:59:49.586 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE DECISION MAKING

00:59:47.117 --> 00:59:51.521 region:rollup2
REQUIRED IN SHARED GOVERNANCE.

00:59:49.586 --> 00:59:53.056 region:rollup2
IS THE PATH FORWARD.

00:59:51.521 --> 00:59:55.425 region:rollup2
NOW LET ME TURN VERY QUICKLY TO

00:59:53.056 --> 00:59:57.227 region:rollup2
CAPITAL FINANCE.

00:59:55.425 --> 01:00:00.464 region:rollup2
I'VE JUST DISCUSSED WITH HIM.

00:59:57.227 --> 01:00:01.932 region:rollup2
THE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS.

01:00:00.464 --> 01:00:03.500 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC HIGHER

01:00:01.932 --> 01:00:05.602 region:rollup2
EDUCATION SYSTEM REVENUE

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:07.504 region:rollup2
VOLATILITY EMPLOYEE SALARIES

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:09.506 region:rollup2
BENEFITS EXCEPT FOR BUT THERE IS

01:00:07.504 --> 01:00:11.308 region:rollup2
ANOTHER MASSIVE EXPENSE LOOMING

01:00:09.506 --> 01:00:13.009 region:rollup2
ON THE HORIZON.

01:00:11.308 --> 01:00:14.311 region:rollup2
WHICH HAS TO DO WITH EXPANDING

01:00:13.009 --> 01:00:16.746 region:rollup2
FACILITIES AT OUR PUBLIC

01:00:14.311 --> 01:00:18.782 region:rollup2
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES.

01:00:16.746 --> 01:00:20.951 region:rollup2
WE NEED A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO

01:00:18.782 --> 01:00:22.986 region:rollup2
PAY FOR RENOVATIONS REPAIRS AND

01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:25.122 region:rollup2
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BEGINNING

01:00:22.986 --> 01:00:26.690 region:rollup2
WITH DECISIONS ABOUT REVENUE

01:00:25.122 --> 01:00:28.859 region:rollup2
SOURCES AND WAYS TO ESTABLISH

01:00:26.690 --> 01:00:30.594 region:rollup2
FUNDING PRIORITIES.

01:00:28.859 --> 01:00:32.596 region:rollup2
THIS REQUIREMENT IS MADE EVEN

01:00:30.594 --> 01:00:34.464 region:rollup2
MORE APPARENT BY THE FACT THAT

01:00:32.596 --> 01:00:36.800 region:rollup2
OUR COLLEGES ARE UNABLE TO MEET

01:00:34.464 --> 01:00:38.301 region:rollup2
THE DEMAND OF GRADUATING HIGH

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:38.969 region:rollup2
SCHOOL STUDENTS FOR COLLEGE

01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:41.004 region:rollup2
SLOTS.

01:00:38.969 --> 01:00:42.239 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE GRADUATION

01:00:41.004 --> 01:00:43.907 region:rollup2
RATES HAVE NOW SHOWN SUCH

01:00:42.239 --> 01:00:44.875 region:rollup2
DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT.

01:00:43.907 --> 01:00:46.543 region:rollup2
THE PROPORTION OF HIGH SCHOOL

01:00:44.875 --> 01:00:48.912 region:rollup2
GRADUATES HAVE COMPLETED THE

01:00:46.543 --> 01:00:51.515 region:rollup2
COURSES REQUIRED ADMISSION TO UC

01:00:48.912 --> 01:00:52.883 region:rollup2
AND CSU CAMPUSES HAS INCREASED

01:00:51.515 --> 01:00:55.218 region:rollup2
DRAMATICALLY.

01:00:52.883 --> 01:00:56.653 region:rollup2
AND WE SHOULD PROVIDE A PLACE

01:00:55.218 --> 01:00:58.155 region:rollup2
OUT OUR PUBLIC COLLEGES AND

01:00:56.653 --> 01:00:59.556 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITIES FOR THESE QUALIFIED

01:00:58.155 --> 01:01:01.358 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

01:00:59.556 --> 01:01:03.460 region:rollup2
IT WILL BE CHALLENGING BUT IT IS

01:01:01.358 --> 01:01:05.428 region:rollup2
BOTHNECESSARY AND DO A BALL AND

01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:06.596 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S NO TIME TO WASTE.

01:01:05.428 --> 01:01:08.164 region:rollup2
SO THE NEEDS IN CAPITAL

01:01:06.596 --> 01:01:09.866 region:rollup2
FINANCING IN HIGHER ED --

01:01:08.164 --> 01:01:11.635 region:rollup2
ENORMOUS AND GROWING THE

01:01:09.866 --> 01:01:13.937 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES

01:01:11.635 --> 01:01:16.206 region:rollup2
THE UC IN THE CSU HAVE ESTIMATED

01:01:13.937 --> 01:01:17.807 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WILL NEED A COMBINED

01:01:16.206 --> 01:01:19.509 region:rollup2
FORTY SEVEN POINT TWO BILLION.

01:01:17.807 --> 01:01:22.412 region:rollup2
TO CONSTRUCT NEW FACILITIES ARE

01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:24.548 region:rollup2
MODERNIZE EXISTING FACILITIES IN

01:01:22.412 --> 01:01:26.082 region:rollup2
THE NEXT FIVE YEARS ALONE.

01:01:24.548 --> 01:01:28.485 region:rollup2
THE GROWTH IN UNDERGRADUATE

01:01:26.082 --> 01:01:30.253 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT.

01:01:28.485 --> 01:01:32.622 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE ACCOMMODATED WE NEED

01:01:30.253 --> 01:01:33.657 region:rollup2
TO FUND ALLOCATIONS FOR CAPITAL

01:01:32.622 --> 01:01:36.193 region:rollup2
OUTLAY IN A WAY THAT IS

01:01:33.657 --> 01:01:37.727 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT AND CLEAR.

01:01:36.193 --> 01:01:39.496 region:rollup2
AND THE HISTORIC SEPARATION

01:01:37.727 --> 01:01:41.898 region:rollup2
BETWEEN OPERATING AND CAPITAL

01:01:39.496 --> 01:01:43.500 region:rollup2
BUDGETS ONLY CONTRIBUTES TO THE

01:01:41.898 --> 01:01:44.200 region:rollup2
FUNDING PROBLEM.

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:47.237 region:rollup2
AND OF COURSE AS WE ARE NOW

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:48.805 region:rollup2
DEFERRED MAY NEEDS ARE GROWING

01:01:47.237 --> 01:01:50.307 region:rollup2
AN ON GOING BASIS AND

01:01:48.805 --> 01:01:52.075 region:rollup2
MAINTENANCE HAS BEEN CUT

01:01:50.307 --> 01:01:53.977 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY.

01:01:52.075 --> 01:01:55.679 region:rollup2
SO WHAT OTHER CHALLENGES THERE

01:01:53.977 --> 01:01:57.614 region:rollup2
ARE WAYS TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM

01:01:55.679 --> 01:01:59.249 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO MOVE AWAY

01:01:57.614 --> 01:01:59.749 region:rollup2
FROM THE CURRENT APPROACH. TO

01:01:59.249 --> 01:02:02.319 region:rollup2
HIGHER EDUCATION CAPITAL

01:01:59.749 --> 01:02:04.054 region:rollup2
FINANCE.

01:02:02.319 --> 01:02:07.057 region:rollup2
TOWARDS AB MUCH MORE WELL

01:02:04.054 --> 01:02:08.491 region:rollup2
DEFINED SYSTEMIC APPROACH.

01:02:07.057 --> 01:02:10.560 region:rollup2
COLLEGE FUTURES FOUNDATION IS

01:02:08.491 --> 01:02:12.495 region:rollup2
TODAY INVOLVED IN A RESEARCH

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:14.698 region:rollup2
PROJECT TO DIDN'T DETERMINE THE

01:02:12.495 --> 01:02:16.399 region:rollup2
CAPACITY CHALLENGE IN HIGHER

01:02:14.698 --> 01:02:17.033 region:rollup2
EDUCATION.

01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:19.035 region:rollup2
TO TWENTY THIRTY THIS INCLUDES

01:02:17.033 --> 01:02:21.238 region:rollup2
ASSESSING CONTRIBUTORS TO DEMAND

01:02:19.035 --> 01:02:23.440 region:rollup2
AND SUPPLY ALONG WITH WAYS FOR

01:02:21.238 --> 01:02:26.042 region:rollup2
BETTER UTILIZATION OF FACILITIES

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:28.712 region:rollup2
ACROSS HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS

01:02:26.042 --> 01:02:30.313 region:rollup2
INCLUDING COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

01:02:28.712 --> 01:02:31.715 region:rollup2
AND PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES.

01:02:30.313 --> 01:02:33.783 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT THERE MUST BE

01:02:31.715 --> 01:02:35.952 region:rollup2
INNOVATIVE WAYS TO MAXIMIZE

01:02:33.783 --> 01:02:38.388 region:rollup2
SPACE AND COORDINATE BETWEEN

01:02:35.952 --> 01:02:40.390 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS.

01:02:38.388 --> 01:02:42.826 region:rollup2
SO IN CONCLUSION.

01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:44.527 region:rollup2
THE FUTURE OF OUR STATE HANGS ON

01:02:42.826 --> 01:02:46.763 region:rollup2
OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE A QUALITY

01:02:44.527 --> 01:02:49.065 region:rollup2
EDUCATION TO EVERY STUDENT WHO

01:02:46.763 --> 01:02:51.167 region:rollup2
IS QUALIFIED AND MOTIVATED TO

01:02:49.065 --> 01:02:53.570 region:rollup2
SEEK A COLLEGE DEGREE.

01:02:51.167 --> 01:02:55.605 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS MUST INCLUDE A FOCUS

01:02:53.570 --> 01:02:57.774 region:rollup2
ON AFFORDABILITY AND TOTAL COST

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:58.642 region:rollup2
OF ATTENDANCE WHICH I KNOW OUR

01:02:57.774 --> 01:03:00.477 region:rollup2
NEXT PANELIST PREPARED TO

01:02:58.642 --> 01:03:03.747 region:rollup2
ADDRESS.

01:03:00.477 --> 01:03:04.848 region:rollup2
BUT ACHIEVING SOLUTIONS POSED BY

01:03:03.747 --> 01:03:07.651 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT SYSTEM OF HIGHER

01:03:04.848 --> 01:03:09.219 region:rollup2
EDUCATION REQUIRES A SYSTEMATIC

01:03:07.651 --> 01:03:11.388 region:rollup2
AND THOUGHTFUL APPROACH.

01:03:09.219 --> 01:03:12.489 region:rollup2
THAT TAKES THE LONG VIEW.

01:03:11.388 --> 01:03:14.557 region:rollup2
AND IT'S HEARTENING TO SEE THE

01:03:12.489 --> 01:03:15.792 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE AND OTHER LEADERS

01:03:14.557 --> 01:03:16.793 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE STATE.

01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:19.362 region:rollup2
TAKING THE ISSUE OF HIGHER

01:03:16.793 --> 01:03:21.264 region:rollup2
EDUCATION FINANCE SERIOUSLY AND

01:04:21.057 --> 01:04:24.794 region:rollup2
FOR NOT INVITING YOU BUT SHARING

01:04:22.559 --> 01:04:26.896 region:rollup2
IT AND YOU KNOW ASKING AT ASKING

01:04:24.794 --> 01:04:28.365 region:rollup2
THE SPEAKER TO US TO FOCUS ON

01:04:26.896 --> 01:04:30.567 region:rollup2
THIS ISSUE --

01:04:28.365 --> 01:04:31.868 region:rollup2
THAT THE MASTER PLAN.

01:04:30.567 --> 01:04:33.670 region:rollup2
FOR HIGHER EDUCATION IS A

01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:35.105 region:rollup2
DOCUMENT SIXTY YEARS ALL THOSE

01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:36.606 region:rollup2
NEVER QUITE CODIFIED BY THE

01:04:35.105 --> 01:04:37.974 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT IT KIND

01:04:36.606 --> 01:04:39.743 region:rollup2
OF ARE BLUEPRINT.

01:04:37.974 --> 01:04:41.144 region:rollup2
I THINK IT BEGS THE QUESTION --

01:04:39.743 --> 01:04:43.847 region:rollup2
Y. WITH THE CREDIT SIX YEARS AGO

01:04:41.144 --> 01:04:45.281 region:rollup2
DOESN'T MEET THE THAT THEY GOALS

01:04:43.847 --> 01:04:48.118 region:rollup2
OF TODAY --

01:04:45.281 --> 01:04:49.419 region:rollup2
BACK THEN IT WASN'T PEOPLE THE

01:04:48.118 --> 01:04:50.854 region:rollup2
FIGHTING EVEN AT HIGHER

01:04:49.419 --> 01:04:52.555 region:rollup2
EDUCATION AS MUCH AS WE DO.

01:04:50.854 --> 01:04:54.190 region:rollup2
NOT KNOW TODAY AND WE KNOW IT'S

01:04:52.555 --> 01:04:55.892 region:rollup2
THE TICKET TO KNOWLEDGE AND THE

01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:57.327 region:rollup2
WHOLE CLASS JOB BUT HARD.

01:04:55.892 --> 01:04:58.561 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC AB.

01:04:57.327 --> 01:05:00.230 region:rollup2
WELDING OF THE FUTURE AND THE

01:04:58.561 --> 01:05:01.898 region:rollup2
LAST FIVE YEARS THAT THE GOOD

01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:04.000 region:rollup2
NEWS IS WE'VE INCREASED HIGHER

01:05:01.898 --> 01:05:05.635 region:rollup2
ED SPENDING IN UC AND CSU MANY

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.469 region:rollup2
COLLEGES BY ONE POINT EIGHT

01:05:05.635 --> 01:05:08.037 region:rollup2
BILLION.

01:05:06.469 --> 01:05:10.473 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU HAD ARE INCREASING CAL

01:05:08.037 --> 01:05:12.175 region:rollup2
GRANT IT'S TWO TWO BILLION BUT?

01:05:10.473 --> 01:05:14.043 region:rollup2
THE WORLD'S ARE TREMENDOUS

01:05:12.175 --> 01:05:16.846 region:rollup2
ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY.

01:05:14.043 --> 01:05:17.480 region:rollup2
IS IS STILL A HUGE ISSUE WE'RE

01:05:16.846 --> 01:05:19.482 region:rollup2
HEARING IT HERE AND HERE FOR THE

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:20.383 region:rollup2
NEXT PANEL --

01:05:19.482 --> 01:05:22.652 region:rollup2
AS WELL.

01:05:20.383 --> 01:05:24.087 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THIS.

01:05:22.652 --> 01:05:24.754 region:rollup2
IS REALLY THAT THE STATE'S FROM

01:05:24.087 --> 01:05:26.256 region:rollup2
WHERE WE WANT TO GO WE DO HAVE A

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:28.158 region:rollup2
NEW ADMINISTRATION COMING IN THE

01:05:26.256 --> 01:05:29.793 region:rollup2
NEXT FEW YEARS --

01:05:28.158 --> 01:05:32.495 region:rollup2
SO I THINK --

01:05:29.793 --> 01:05:33.663 region:rollup2
IT ALLOWS US TO TALK ABOUT --

01:05:32.495 --> 01:05:35.231 region:rollup2
OUR PRIORITIES FOR HIGHER

01:05:33.663 --> 01:05:36.833 region:rollup2
EDUCATION I KNOW A LOT OF THESE

01:05:35.231 --> 01:05:38.234 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT SWIRLS AND WHAT DO

01:05:36.833 --> 01:05:39.702 region:rollup2
WE DO ABOUT IT AND WHERE IS THE

01:05:38.234 --> 01:05:41.438 region:rollup2
MAGIC.

01:05:39.702 --> 01:05:43.339 region:rollup2
POT OF MONEY IN ISRAEL HIDDEN

01:05:41.438 --> 01:05:44.674 region:rollup2
SUITCASE UNDER HERE WITH A

01:05:43.339 --> 01:05:45.875 region:rollup2
COUPLE BILLION FOR HIGHER AT

01:05:44.674 --> 01:05:47.477 region:rollup2
DURING THE BUDGET SUFFER FOR

01:05:45.875 --> 01:05:49.078 region:rollup2
YEARS I HAVEN'T SEEN IT BUT

01:05:47.477 --> 01:05:50.547 region:rollup2
STILL I'M STILL LOOKING FOR IT.

01:05:49.078 --> 01:05:52.248 region:rollup2
BUT BUT YOU DO RAISE SOME ISSUES

01:05:50.547 --> 01:05:53.416 region:rollup2
AT THE AYE I'M SUPPORTIVE OF IS

01:05:52.248 --> 01:05:54.684 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK THAT.

01:05:53.416 --> 01:05:57.153 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD HAVE.

01:05:54.684 --> 01:05:59.923 region:rollup2
A STABLE SOURCE OF STATE MONEY

01:05:57.153 --> 01:06:00.490 region:rollup2
EVERY YEAR TO THE UC AND CSU

01:05:59.923 --> 01:06:02.625 region:rollup2
KNOWS DEBATE THIS PAST YEAR

01:06:00.490 --> 01:06:04.327 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S THREE PERCENTER FOR

01:06:02.625 --> 01:06:06.963 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW.

01:06:04.327 --> 01:06:08.698 region:rollup2
THE HARD THING IS WE GET 3% AND

01:06:06.963 --> 01:06:10.867 region:rollup2
IT JUST PAYS FOR THE BASICS

01:06:08.698 --> 01:06:12.535 region:rollup2
SPACE FOR HEALTHCARE COSTS YOU

01:06:10.867 --> 01:06:14.137 region:rollup2
BASICALLY DON'T GET ANY.

01:06:12.535 --> 01:06:16.005 region:rollup2
NEW SLOTS FOR STUDENTS WHO DON'T

01:06:14.137 --> 01:06:17.941 region:rollup2
GET ANY INCREASED AFFORDABILITY

01:06:16.005 --> 01:06:19.142 region:rollup2
INOTES CAO LIKE GETTING A BUDGET

01:06:17.941 --> 01:06:20.610 region:rollup2
TO REMODEL YOUR HOUSE AND ALL

01:06:19.142 --> 01:06:22.312 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE IS MONEY FOR YOUR NEW

01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:23.546 region:rollup2
PLUMBING AND ELECTRICAL YOU

01:06:22.312 --> 01:06:25.281 region:rollup2
DON'T GET ANY NEW.

01:06:23.546 --> 01:06:25.849 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT YOU'D LIKE FOR YOU

01:06:25.281 --> 01:06:27.717 region:rollup2
FOR WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

01:06:25.849 --> 01:06:29.919 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISH AND SO THAT'S KIND OF

01:06:27.717 --> 01:06:30.920 region:rollup2
THAT THAT TACKLE THAT WERE THAT

01:06:29.919 --> 01:06:31.721 region:rollup2
GOOD THE ISSUES ARE TRIED TACKLE

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:32.856 region:rollup2
IS THAT.

01:06:31.721 --> 01:06:35.558 region:rollup2
SO MUCH OF THE COSTS ARE JUST

01:06:32.856 --> 01:06:37.227 region:rollup2
FOR THE BASICS YOU DON'T EVEN.

01:06:35.558 --> 01:06:38.595 region:rollup2
THE FAMILIES AND ACCESS AND

01:06:37.227 --> 01:06:40.029 region:rollup2
AFFORDABILITY AND SO FORTH SO IT

01:06:38.595 --> 01:06:41.431 region:rollup2
SO YOU DID MENTION THE STATE

01:06:40.029 --> 01:06:43.132 region:rollup2
GOING FORWARD.

01:06:41.431 --> 01:06:47.337 region:rollup2
AND HAVING A COMMITMENTS WHETHER

01:06:43.132 --> 01:06:48.204 region:rollup2
IT'S THE STATE'S 5% PER YEAR.

01:06:47.337 --> 01:06:49.606 region:rollup2
GOD INCREASE MONEY WHICH I KNOW

01:06:48.204 --> 01:06:51.140 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEMS WOULD BE VERY

01:06:49.606 --> 01:06:52.675 region:rollup2
PLEASED WITH HE SAID THE

01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:54.110 region:rollup2
STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE.

01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:55.411 region:rollup2
TO PAY IN SOME OUT TO I'M NOT

01:06:54.110 --> 01:06:57.213 region:rollup2
ADVERSE TO THAT I KNOW THAT SOME

01:06:55.411 --> 01:06:58.948 region:rollup2
PEOPLE SOME FOLKS ARE ARE BARELY

01:06:57.213 --> 01:07:00.517 region:rollup2
ADVERSE TO STUDENT FEE HIKES I I

01:06:58.948 --> 01:07:03.019 region:rollup2
GET IT BUT THERE'S NO.

01:07:00.517 --> 01:07:05.188 region:rollup2
FREE LUNCH HERE ON BUT I WILL

01:07:03.019 --> 01:07:07.323 region:rollup2
NOTE THAT WITH ALL THE STUDENT

01:07:05.188 --> 01:07:08.191 region:rollup2
FEE INCREASE IS GRANTED THAT'S

01:07:07.323 --> 01:07:10.593 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

01:07:08.191 --> 01:07:11.461 region:rollup2
SUPER WEALTHY CAN AFFORD IT --

01:07:10.593 --> 01:07:12.862 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE MIDDLE CLASS THE

01:07:11.461 --> 01:07:14.731 region:rollup2
ONES THAT ARE GETTING SQUEEZED

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:16.266 region:rollup2
IT'S A LOW INCOME ONES THAT GET

01:07:14.731 --> 01:07:17.534 region:rollup2
CAL GRANT AND FINANCIAL AID SO

01:07:16.266 --> 01:07:19.202 region:rollup2
THAT'S COVER ANYWAY.

01:07:17.534 --> 01:07:22.539 region:rollup2
THAT JUST COMES FROM THE STATE

01:07:19.202 --> 01:07:24.274 region:rollup2
AS WELL SO YOU KNOW ALMOST A

01:07:22.539 --> 01:07:25.608 region:rollup2
THIRD TO HALF OF THE MONEY.

01:07:24.274 --> 01:07:26.943 region:rollup2
THAT YOU THAT FOR THAT STUDENT

01:07:25.608 --> 01:07:28.444 region:rollup2
FEE HIKES YET TO COME BACK AND

01:07:26.943 --> 01:07:29.779 region:rollup2
GET CALIFORNIA TO PAY AND IN

01:07:28.444 --> 01:07:31.981 region:rollup2
INTO IT AGAIN.

01:07:29.779 --> 01:07:33.416 region:rollup2
AND SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

01:07:31.981 --> 01:07:35.985 region:rollup2
ANSWER IS TO THAT AND AND IF

01:07:33.416 --> 01:07:37.387 region:rollup2
THAT IS IF SO THAT MAKES MAYBE

01:07:35.985 --> 01:07:40.089 region:rollup2
THE STATE CONTRIBUTION.

01:07:37.387 --> 01:07:41.958 region:rollup2
MAYBE 6% DRIVEN HIGHER SO.

01:07:40.089 --> 01:07:43.560 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT'S ALL

01:07:41.958 --> 01:07:44.994 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABLE AND SO YOU KNOW

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:47.297 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO

01:07:44.994 --> 01:07:49.098 region:rollup2
LOOK AT COST CONTAINMENT AND YOU

01:07:47.297 --> 01:07:51.467 region:rollup2
SEEN CSU WHAT CAN BE WHAT CAN WE

01:07:49.098 --> 01:07:52.902 region:rollup2
DO DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE THIS IS

01:07:51.467 --> 01:07:54.470 region:rollup2
NOT AN AND ENOUGH TO GO AROUND

01:07:52.902 --> 01:07:56.439 region:rollup2
BUT I WILL ASK YOU ON THAT.

01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:56.940 region:rollup2
ON THEM MODERATE AND PREDICTABLE

01:07:56.439 --> 01:07:59.208 region:rollup2
FEE INCREASES IS THERE A

01:07:56.940 --> 01:08:01.511 region:rollup2
CERTAIN.

01:07:59.208 --> 01:08:02.312 region:rollup2
DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT YOU THINK THE

01:08:01.511 --> 01:08:05.815 region:rollup2
THE COLLEGE FEATURES FOUNDATION

01:08:02.312 --> 01:08:06.749 region:rollup2
IS LOOKING THERE IS NO DOLLAR

01:08:05.815 --> 01:08:08.584 region:rollup2
AMOUNT WHAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING

01:08:06.749 --> 01:08:10.386 region:rollup2
IS AN APPROACH.

01:08:08.584 --> 01:08:12.689 region:rollup2
AND WERE ACTUALLY --

01:08:10.386 --> 01:08:15.124 region:rollup2
ABOUT TO UNDERTAKE AND ANOTHER

01:08:12.689 --> 01:08:16.025 region:rollup2
SET OF RESEARCH QUESTIONS.

01:08:15.124 --> 01:08:18.494 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD LOOK AT IT

01:08:16.025 --> 01:08:21.064 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVELY SO IF YOU PAT IF

01:08:18.494 --> 01:08:23.933 region:rollup2
YOU MODEL THIS OUT OVER.

01:08:21.064 --> 01:08:25.001 region:rollup2
YEARS WITH THE WORD MULLIN OUT.

01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:27.637 region:rollup2
TO TWENTY THIRTY WHAT WOULD THE

01:08:25.001 --> 01:08:30.073 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF COR REVENUE

01:08:27.637 --> 01:08:33.242 region:rollup2
GROWTH BE ON ANY SINGULAR YEAR

01:08:30.073 --> 01:08:33.710 region:rollup2
MATCHED WE WOULD HOPE IN TUITION

01:08:33.242 --> 01:08:35.144 region:rollup2
SO THAT IT'S MODERATE

01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:36.346 region:rollup2
PREDICTABLE.

01:08:35.144 --> 01:08:38.581 region:rollup2
TUITION WOULD HOLD WE WOULD

01:08:36.346 --> 01:08:40.116 region:rollup2
ASSUME FOR A COHORT SO WHEN

01:08:38.581 --> 01:08:41.250 region:rollup2
YOU'RE INCOMING FRESHMEN.

01:08:40.116 --> 01:08:42.218 region:rollup2
YOU BASICALLY KNOW WHAT YOU'RE

01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:44.187 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE PAYING BY THE TIME

01:08:42.218 --> 01:08:45.822 region:rollup2
YOU GRADUATE SO THAT THERE ISN'T

01:08:44.187 --> 01:08:47.390 region:rollup2
THAT KIND OF UNPREDICTABILITY.

01:08:45.822 --> 01:08:48.891 region:rollup2
SO THAT THE PRINCIPLES WOULD BE

01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:50.526 region:rollup2
STABILITY OR REVENUE DOES

01:08:48.891 --> 01:08:52.295 region:rollup2
PREDICTABILITY REDUCED

01:08:50.526 --> 01:08:53.262 region:rollup2
VOLATILITY.

01:08:52.295 --> 01:08:55.999 region:rollup2
AND THEN TO YOUR POINT SENATOR

01:08:53.262 --> 01:08:59.268 region:rollup2
WE ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT --

01:08:55.999 --> 01:09:01.637 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT THE COST

01:08:59.268 --> 01:09:04.407 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT HAS TO BE A PART OF

01:09:01.637 --> 01:09:06.509 region:rollup2
THIS SO PUTTING IN PLACE SOME

01:09:04.407 --> 01:09:08.344 region:rollup2
PRODUCTIVITY MEASURES THAT IF

01:09:06.509 --> 01:09:10.546 region:rollup2
THOSE WERE APPROVED --

01:09:08.344 --> 01:09:12.115 region:rollup2
THEN IN FACT THERE MIGHT BE SOME

01:09:10.546 --> 01:09:13.850 region:rollup2
RELEASE OF RESERVES HOW WOULD

01:09:12.115 --> 01:09:15.918 region:rollup2
YOU CREATE SOME SORT OF A

01:09:13.850 --> 01:09:17.353 region:rollup2
STABILIZATION FUND SO THESE ARE

01:09:15.918 --> 01:09:19.055 region:rollup2
ALL CONCEPTS THAT WERE.

01:09:17.353 --> 01:09:21.391 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT. ONE

01:09:19.055 --> 01:09:23.192 region:rollup2
THING BY ITSELF CAN'T SOLVE THIS

01:09:21.391 --> 01:09:25.328 region:rollup2
RIDDLE IT REALLY HAS TO BE

01:09:23.192 --> 01:09:26.663 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE AND SO WE'RE GONNA

01:09:25.328 --> 01:09:28.231 region:rollup2
BE DOING SOME WORK THAT LOOKS AT

01:09:26.663 --> 01:09:29.065 region:rollup2
BOTH.

01:09:28.231 --> 01:09:31.000 region:rollup2
IDENTIFYING WHAT IS THE

01:09:29.065 --> 01:09:32.235 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE LEVEL FOR RESERVE

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.203 region:rollup2
GIVEN THAT THERE IS AN

01:09:32.235 --> 01:09:36.205 region:rollup2
INEVITABLE DOWNTURN WHAT COULD

01:09:34.203 --> 01:09:37.640 region:rollup2
TUITION LOOK LIKE WHAT SHOULD

01:09:36.205 --> 01:09:39.075 region:rollup2
THE COR REVENUE.

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:40.276 region:rollup2
STREAM BE IN TERMS OF GENERAL

01:09:39.075 --> 01:09:41.377 region:rollup2
FUND SUPPORT.

01:09:40.276 --> 01:09:42.812 region:rollup2
AND THEN WHAT KIND OF

01:09:41.377 --> 01:09:44.647 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES AROUND

01:09:42.812 --> 01:09:46.482 region:rollup2
COST CONTAINMENT AND

01:09:44.647 --> 01:09:47.316 region:rollup2
PRODUCTIVITY SO ALL OF THAT

01:09:46.482 --> 01:09:47.884 region:rollup2
TOGETHER.

01:09:47.316 --> 01:09:49.952 region:rollup2
PERHAPS COULD BEGIN TO LOOK

01:09:47.884 --> 01:09:51.888 region:rollup2
LIKE.

01:09:49.952 --> 01:09:53.056 region:rollup2
IS THAT --

01:09:51.888 --> 01:09:55.124 region:rollup2
COULD BE SUPPORTED BY THE PUBLIC

01:09:53.056 --> 01:09:56.192 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEMS THEMSELVES AND AND

01:09:55.124 --> 01:09:59.395 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY THE LEGISLATURE OF IF

01:09:56.192 --> 01:10:00.930 region:rollup2
THAT BE THE CASE.

01:09:59.395 --> 01:10:03.866 region:rollup2
THEN MAYBE HAVE A QUESTION FOR

01:10:00.930 --> 01:10:05.635 region:rollup2
THE LA JOH YA THE GOVERNOR AND

01:10:03.866 --> 01:10:07.303 region:rollup2
EVEN SHE FELT LIKE.

01:10:05.635 --> 01:10:07.904 region:rollup2
LET'S HAVE ANALYSTS SAID THAT

01:10:07.303 --> 01:10:08.704 region:rollup2
YEAH RECESSION MAYBE.

01:10:07.904 --> 01:10:10.139 region:rollup2
COMING ONE DAY AND WE CAN'T

01:10:08.704 --> 01:10:11.874 region:rollup2
COUNT ON THIS.

01:10:10.139 --> 01:10:14.110 region:rollup2
THESE INCREASE WE'VE SEEN FOR

01:10:11.874 --> 01:10:15.645 region:rollup2
THE PAST FIVE YEARS AND SO --

01:10:14.110 --> 01:10:16.712 region:rollup2
HOW DO YOU VIEW THE LONG TERM

01:10:15.645 --> 01:10:18.414 region:rollup2
FUNDING STRUCTURE OF HIGHER

01:10:16.712 --> 01:10:19.615 region:rollup2
EDUCATION AND?

01:10:18.414 --> 01:10:21.584 region:rollup2
AND HOW WE SHOULD YOU KNOW

01:10:19.615 --> 01:10:23.586 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THIS.

01:10:21.584 --> 01:10:28.891 region:rollup2
THIS COMPLEX --

01:10:23.586 --> 01:10:30.860 region:rollup2
FINANCE ORBITAL.

01:10:28.891 --> 01:10:32.228 region:rollup2
WELL I THINK WE'D ECHO A LOT OF

01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:33.963 region:rollup2
THE THINGS THAT --

01:10:32.228 --> 01:10:36.065 region:rollup2
CALLED FUTURE JUST NOTED ON I

01:10:33.963 --> 01:10:37.400 region:rollup2
THINK ONE OF THE BIG CHALLENGES

01:10:36.065 --> 01:10:39.602 region:rollup2
IF YOU IF YOU LOOK HISTORICALLY

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:41.437 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN THAT VOLATILITY.

01:10:39.602 --> 01:10:42.739 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK ONE OF THE KEY

01:10:41.437 --> 01:10:44.507 region:rollup2
TOOLS YOU HAVE AT YOUR DISPOSAL

01:10:42.739 --> 01:10:46.075 region:rollup2
IS.

01:10:44.507 --> 01:10:46.943 region:rollup2
TO SET UP SORT OF RESERVE IN THE

01:10:46.075 --> 01:10:48.644 region:rollup2
BUDGET EVERY YEAR THAT YOU CAN

01:10:46.943 --> 01:10:50.413 region:rollup2
DRAW ON WHEN TIMES ARE ARE BAD

01:10:48.644 --> 01:10:52.148 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT'S A KEY TOOL BEFORE

01:10:50.413 --> 01:10:52.782 region:rollup2
YOU AND THINKING ABOUT.

01:10:52.148 --> 01:10:53.916 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SETTING THAT YOU KNOW

01:10:52.782 --> 01:10:54.917 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL

01:10:53.916 --> 01:10:56.152 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT YOU ALSO HAVE

01:10:54.917 --> 01:10:57.453 region:rollup2
ANOTHER RESERVE THAT YOU HAVE

01:10:56.152 --> 01:10:58.721 region:rollup2
MORE CONTROL OVER YOU HAVE A

01:10:57.453 --> 01:10:59.989 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF DIFFERENT HERBS THAT

01:10:58.721 --> 01:11:00.356 region:rollup2
YOU CAN DRAW ON WHEN WHEN TIMES

01:10:59.989 --> 01:11:02.225 region:rollup2
ARE.

01:11:00.356 --> 01:11:03.993 region:rollup2
BAD AND THAT SORT OF THE THE KEY

01:11:02.225 --> 01:11:04.494 region:rollup2
TO I THINK WE WOULD COURAGE YOU

01:11:03.993 --> 01:11:05.828 region:rollup2
TO THINK ABOUT AS YOU'RE

01:11:04.494 --> 01:11:07.130 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT WAYS.

01:11:05.828 --> 01:11:13.603 region:rollup2
TO HAVE A FUNDING BE MORE

01:11:07.130 --> 01:11:13.903 region:rollup2
PREDICTABLE MUST VOLATILE

01:11:13.603 --> 01:11:18.141 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:11:13.903 --> 01:11:19.275 region:rollup2
A MS MEDINA.

01:11:18.141 --> 01:11:23.212 region:rollup2
BUT IT THANK GOD I DON'T FOR

01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:24.614 region:rollup2
COMING AND HER PRESENTATION --

01:11:23.212 --> 01:11:25.882 region:rollup2
AND AND I THINK THE SUBJECT THAT

01:11:24.614 --> 01:11:27.483 region:rollup2
WE'RE DISCUSSING IS PROBABLY TO

01:11:25.882 --> 01:11:28.918 region:rollup2
ME.

01:11:27.483 --> 01:11:30.686 region:rollup2
AS CHAIR OF HIGHER EDUCATION.

01:11:28.918 --> 01:11:32.388 region:rollup2
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT.

01:11:30.686 --> 01:11:34.390 region:rollup2
AND IN HIGHER EDUCATION.

01:11:32.388 --> 01:11:36.692 region:rollup2
AND AND I HAVE FELT.

01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:37.260 region:rollup2
THAT IN MY SIX YEARS HERE.

01:11:36.692 --> 01:11:38.361 region:rollup2
SERVING ON THE COMMITTEE OF

01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:39.962 region:rollup2
HIGHER ED.

01:11:38.361 --> 01:11:42.298 region:rollup2
AND AND AS THE CHAIR.

01:11:39.962 --> 01:11:44.267 region:rollup2
THAT THERE HAS BEEN.

01:11:42.298 --> 01:11:46.102 region:rollup2
NO MORE IMPORTANT --

01:11:44.267 --> 01:11:48.237 region:rollup2
POLICY QUESTION THAN JUST THAT

01:11:46.102 --> 01:11:50.339 region:rollup2
THE FUNDING.

01:11:48.237 --> 01:11:52.041 region:rollup2
AND IT IS I AND I HAVE SAID.

01:11:50.339 --> 01:11:53.843 region:rollup2
AND I THINK I'VE SAID IT ALMOST

01:11:52.041 --> 01:11:56.179 region:rollup2
EVERY YEAR THAT IT IS.

01:11:53.843 --> 01:11:57.180 region:rollup2
UP SOMEHOW. TO ME --

01:11:56.179 --> 01:12:01.050 region:rollup2
JUST [inaudible]

01:11:57.180 --> 01:12:02.018 region:rollup2
SHOCKING REALLY THE THAT THE

01:12:01.050 --> 01:12:02.652 region:rollup2
METHOD THAT WE HAVE TO GO

01:12:02.018 --> 01:12:04.320 region:rollup2
THROUGH.

01:12:02.652 --> 01:12:06.088 region:rollup2
EVERY YEAR TO THAT FUND HIGHER

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:09.425 region:rollup2
EDUCATION.

01:12:06.088 --> 01:12:10.526 region:rollup2
AND AND I SAY SHOCKING BECAUSE

01:12:09.425 --> 01:12:12.261 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AS THE EXPERIENCE IS

01:12:10.526 --> 01:12:14.230 region:rollup2
SHOWN --

01:12:12.261 --> 01:12:17.066 region:rollup2
EVERY EVERY YEAR WE KINDA.

01:12:14.230 --> 01:12:19.135 region:rollup2
STOP BONUS START FROM SCRATCH.

01:12:17.066 --> 01:12:21.337 region:rollup2
IT FEELS THAT WAY --

01:12:19.135 --> 01:12:22.605 region:rollup2
AND FINDING THE FUNDS TO TO FOR

01:12:21.337 --> 01:12:24.006 region:rollup2
THE TO FIND HIGHER EDUCATION AND

01:12:22.605 --> 01:12:25.241 region:rollup2
SOME YEARS I WE DO BETTER THAN

01:12:24.006 --> 01:12:26.509 region:rollup2
OTHERS.

01:12:25.241 --> 01:12:27.443 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY IN THIS PAST YEAR

01:12:26.509 --> 01:12:29.045 region:rollup2
WE'VE DONE WELL.

01:12:27.443 --> 01:12:31.447 region:rollup2
BUT IN PREVIOUS YEARS WE HAVEN'T

01:12:29.045 --> 01:12:32.048 region:rollup2
DONE SO WELL AND IT SEEMS AND I

01:12:31.447 --> 01:12:33.549 region:rollup2
AM.

01:12:32.048 --> 01:12:35.451 region:rollup2
I THINK IN PERFECT AGREEMENT

01:12:33.549 --> 01:12:36.619 region:rollup2
THAT THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER

01:12:35.451 --> 01:12:39.789 region:rollup2
WAY.

01:12:36.619 --> 01:12:42.058 region:rollup2
AND THAT THAT IS A INCUMBENT

01:12:39.789 --> 01:12:43.793 region:rollup2
UPON THIS AS THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:12:42.058 --> 01:12:46.195 region:rollup2
FIND THAT BETTER WAY.

01:12:43.793 --> 01:12:48.331 region:rollup2
OF THAT WE WE WE SHOULDN'T HAVE.

01:12:46.195 --> 01:12:49.365 region:rollup2
TO DO WHAT WE GO THROUGH EVERY

01:12:48.331 --> 01:12:50.967 region:rollup2
YEAR -- THAN

01:12:49.365 --> 01:12:52.735 region:rollup2
IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE.

01:12:50.967 --> 01:12:54.570 region:rollup2
I I UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES

01:12:52.735 --> 01:12:57.373 region:rollup2
AND I THINK.

01:12:54.570 --> 01:12:59.175 region:rollup2
I DONE A GOOD JOB OF OF TELLING

01:12:57.373 --> 01:13:02.645 region:rollup2
US WHAT THOSE CHALLENGES ARE --

01:12:59.175 --> 01:13:03.479 region:rollup2
BUT I YOU KNOW WOULD I COMMIT TO

01:13:02.645 --> 01:13:06.415 region:rollup2
WORKING.

01:13:03.479 --> 01:13:07.550 region:rollup2
WITH THIS CHAIR AND CHAIR OF THE

01:13:06.415 --> 01:13:09.485 region:rollup2
BUDGET COMMITTEE OF SUB TO TO

01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:11.254 region:rollup2
FIND A BETTER WAY.

01:13:09.485 --> 01:13:13.589 region:rollup2
AND AND I THINK THE CITIZENS OF

01:13:11.254 --> 01:13:14.523 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA THE STUDENTS TO

01:13:13.589 --> 01:13:16.025 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA --

01:13:14.523 --> 01:13:17.593 region:rollup2
ARE DESERVING OF THE BETTER WAY

01:13:16.025 --> 01:13:18.661 region:rollup2
AND CERTAINLY FOR WHETHER YOU'RE

01:13:17.593 --> 01:13:20.296 region:rollup2

BUT WHETHER YOU'RE STUDENT AND

01:13:20.296 --> 01:13:23.633 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH OF

01:13:21.764 --> 01:13:25.701 region:rollup2
WONDERING YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IS

01:13:23.633 --> 01:13:26.235 region:rollup2
TUITION GOING TO GO UP.

01:13:25.701 --> 01:13:27.737 region:rollup2
EVERY YEAR WHILE YOU'RE A

01:13:26.235 --> 01:13:28.938 region:rollup2
COLLEGE STUDENT IS SOMETHING

01:13:27.737 --> 01:13:30.172 region:rollup2
THAT STUDENTS AND PARENTS

01:13:28.938 --> 01:13:32.041 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH.

01:13:30.172 --> 01:13:34.110 region:rollup2
SO I I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

01:13:32.041 --> 01:13:36.212 region:rollup2
THIS I KNOW IT'S A DIFFICULT.

01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:37.880 region:rollup2
THAT SUBJECT BUT CERTAINLY ONE

01:13:36.212 --> 01:13:39.782 region:rollup2
THAT IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT.

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:41.083 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENT.

01:13:39.782 --> 01:13:43.119 region:rollup2
THING YOU'RE MUCH DOCTOR WEBER

01:13:43.119 --> 01:13:46.122 region:rollup2
FOR FOR THE INFORMATION AND I

01:13:45.288 --> 01:13:46.789 region:rollup2
THINK THOSE OF US WHO'VE BEEN A

01:13:46.122 --> 01:13:47.690 region:rollup2
LITTLE WHILE.

01:13:46.789 --> 01:13:51.627 region:rollup2
I KNOW THAT --

01:13:47.690 --> 01:13:53.629 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT'S COMPLEX ISSUE IN

01:13:51.627 --> 01:13:55.231 region:rollup2
TERMS OF FUNDING AND FINANCING.

01:13:53.629 --> 01:13:56.599 region:rollup2
WHAT DO YOU --

01:13:55.231 --> 01:13:57.767 region:rollup2
I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU IN A PERFECT

01:13:56.599 --> 01:14:01.037 region:rollup2
WORLD.

01:13:57.767 --> 01:14:02.171 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT WE DO.

01:14:01.037 --> 01:14:03.739 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I THINK WHAT WE'RE

01:14:02.171 --> 01:14:05.474 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT NOW IS REARRANGING

01:14:03.739 --> 01:14:06.976 region:rollup2
THE CHAIRS ON THE TITANIC.

01:14:05.474 --> 01:14:07.610 region:rollup2
AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS

01:14:06.976 --> 01:14:09.578 region:rollup2
THING'S GOING DOWN A MEDICAL SO

01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:11.047 region:rollup2
--

01:14:09.578 --> 01:14:12.148 region:rollup2
SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IN A

01:14:11.047 --> 01:14:14.684 region:rollup2
PERFECT WORLD.

01:14:12.148 --> 01:14:16.252 region:rollup2
OF WHAT WOULD WE DO AND NO OTHER

01:14:14.684 --> 01:14:17.586 region:rollup2
PLACES HAVE TALKED ABOUT OF THE

01:14:16.252 --> 01:14:19.956 region:rollup2
STATES HAVE TALKED ABOUT.

01:14:17.586 --> 01:14:20.990 region:rollup2
OF PAYING IT FORWARD IN TERMS OF

01:14:19.956 --> 01:14:22.391 region:rollup2
FREE SPEECH EDUCATION FOR

01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:24.460 region:rollup2
STUDENTS HAVE BEEN PAY FOR IT

01:14:22.391 --> 01:14:25.695 region:rollup2
AFTER THEY GRADUATED AND SO THAT

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:26.762 region:rollup2
CREATES A DIFFERENT STREAM OF

01:14:25.695 --> 01:14:27.797 region:rollup2
RESOURCES.

01:14:26.762 --> 01:14:29.432 region:rollup2
BRING WHAT WOULD WE DO I YOU

01:14:27.797 --> 01:14:31.267 region:rollup2
KNOW I'M FROM THE WEALTH FROM

01:14:29.432 --> 01:14:32.735 region:rollup2
THE ORIGINAL UNIVERSITY

01:14:31.267 --> 01:14:34.570 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA CALLED THE ORIGINAL

01:14:32.735 --> 01:14:35.638 region:rollup2
THAT LESS OF A LONG TIME WE PAID

01:14:34.570 --> 01:14:37.073 region:rollup2
NO TUITION.

01:14:35.638 --> 01:14:38.975 region:rollup2
WILL ONLY PAID FEES EIGHTY

01:14:37.073 --> 01:14:41.010 region:rollup2
DOLLARS A SEMESTER AT OUR

01:14:38.975 --> 01:14:42.878 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHEN I START

01:14:41.010 --> 01:14:43.479 region:rollup2
TEACHING PAID.

01:14:42.878 --> 01:14:45.481 region:rollup2
THIRTY SEVEN FIFTY A SEMESTER

01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:47.350 region:rollup2
THEY PAID FEES IT NEVER PAID FOR

01:14:45.481 --> 01:14:48.951 region:rollup2
THE PROFESSORS IN THE EDUCATION

01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:49.785 region:rollup2
SO WHAT DOES NOT AS YOU CAN SEE

01:14:48.951 --> 01:14:51.821 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THE CHART AND HOW

01:14:49.785 --> 01:14:53.789 region:rollup2
IT'S CHANGED SO DRAMATICALLY.

01:14:51.821 --> 01:14:54.890 region:rollup2
SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT --

01:14:53.789 --> 01:14:56.459 region:rollup2
IN A REAL WORLD HOW DO WE GET

01:14:54.890 --> 01:14:57.593 region:rollup2
BACK TO THAT --

01:14:56.459 --> 01:14:59.662 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I THINK THAT WHEN WE

01:14:57.593 --> 01:15:01.297 region:rollup2
TALK UP HERE WE WERE TALKING

01:14:59.662 --> 01:15:01.864 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE THINGS THAT WE KNOW.

01:15:01.297 --> 01:15:03.499 region:rollup2
AND NOT THINGS THAT WE DON'T

01:15:01.864 --> 01:15:06.335 region:rollup2
KNOW.

01:15:03.499 --> 01:15:08.404 region:rollup2
AND WE OTHER SO SEEM TO BE.

01:15:06.335 --> 01:15:09.605 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE STATES ARE TRYING TO

01:15:08.404 --> 01:15:10.239 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT

01:15:09.605 --> 01:15:11.907 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTLY AND WHAT WE'RE DOING

01:15:10.239 --> 01:15:12.541 region:rollup2
--

01:15:11.907 --> 01:15:14.377 region:rollup2
IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO KNOW

01:15:12.541 --> 01:15:15.678 region:rollup2
--

01:15:14.377 --> 01:15:17.346 region:rollup2
I AM SURE LIKE MOST FOLKS USE

01:15:15.678 --> 01:15:19.148 region:rollup2
HER TO MY TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:20.149 region:rollup2
HOW WE DO TAXES IN CALIFORNIA IS

01:15:19.148 --> 01:15:22.251 region:rollup2
ALL WRONG.

01:15:20.149 --> 01:15:24.420 region:rollup2
AND DATA AND SO AS A RESULT IN

01:15:22.251 --> 01:15:26.088 region:rollup2
THE OLD WAY WE HIT SEEM TO BE

01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:27.556 region:rollup2
MUCH MORE STABLE AS FUNDING.

01:15:26.088 --> 01:15:29.258 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S A DIFFICULT ISSUE TO

01:15:27.556 --> 01:15:30.760 region:rollup2
BITE OFF WITH THE PUBLIC.

01:15:29.258 --> 01:15:32.261 region:rollup2
AND YET AT THE SAME TIME IF THEY

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:33.629 region:rollup2
HAD SOME ASSURANCE THAT THERE

01:15:32.261 --> 01:15:35.064 region:rollup2
WOULD BE SOME DRAMATIC CHANGES.

01:15:33.629 --> 01:15:37.767 region:rollup2
LIKE FREE EDUCATION LIKE WE USED

01:15:35.064 --> 01:15:39.602 region:rollup2
TO HAVE.

01:15:37.767 --> 01:15:41.804 region:rollup2
IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO THROW

01:15:39.602 --> 01:15:43.239 region:rollup2
THAT INTO THE CONVERSATION SO.

01:15:41.804 --> 01:15:44.440 region:rollup2
AS AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:15:43.239 --> 01:15:46.108 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE CALIFORNIA NIGHT OF

01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:48.344 region:rollup2
THE DAY BUT TOMORROW.

01:15:46.108 --> 01:15:50.312 region:rollup2
IT'S WHERE WE ALMOST BECOME --

01:15:48.344 --> 01:15:52.381 region:rollup2
BILL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

01:15:50.312 --> 01:15:54.717 region:rollup2
DEPRESSION PROVEN SOMEWHERE

01:15:52.381 --> 01:15:55.918 region:rollup2
RECESSION PROOF IN SOME WAY OF

01:15:54.717 --> 01:15:57.920 region:rollup2
BUT BECAUSE OF THE WAY WE FUND

01:15:55.918 --> 01:15:59.055 region:rollup2
THINGS AND HOW WE OPERATE.

01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:00.523 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT DO YOU FOLKS CMU YOU

01:15:59.055 --> 01:16:02.858 region:rollup2
THE NUMBERS CRUNCHERS IN THE

01:16:00.523 --> 01:16:04.794 region:rollup2
FINANCIERS AND ALL THOSE FOLKS.

01:16:02.858 --> 01:16:05.661 region:rollup2
IN A REAL WORLD AND AND I SHOULD

01:16:04.794 --> 01:16:08.230 region:rollup2
SAY IT WILL WORK IS WHEN THAT

01:16:05.661 --> 01:16:09.732 region:rollup2
NOW BUT IN AN IDEAL WORLD WHAT

01:16:08.230 --> 01:16:11.367 region:rollup2
WOULD WE DO.

01:16:09.732 --> 01:16:12.068 region:rollup2
I KNOW WE CAN SAY WE COULD

01:16:11.367 --> 01:16:14.136 region:rollup2
STABILIZE FUNNY.

01:16:12.068 --> 01:16:16.972 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS --

01:16:14.136 --> 01:16:18.541 region:rollup2
IN A WORLD IT'S UNSTABLE OKAY SO

01:16:16.972 --> 01:16:20.009 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT WHAT WE WHAT WE

01:16:18.541 --> 01:16:23.779 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT AND AND AND HOW DO

01:16:20.009 --> 01:16:25.548 region:rollup2
WE GET THERE.

01:16:23.779 --> 01:16:27.016 region:rollup2
WILL YOU IDENTIFY OF A FEW

01:16:25.548 --> 01:16:28.851 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS --

01:16:27.016 --> 01:16:31.053 region:rollup2
VOLATILITY OF REVENUES

01:16:28.851 --> 01:16:32.721 region:rollup2
PRIORITIES DO YOU HAVE YOU KNOW

01:16:31.053 --> 01:16:35.024 region:rollup2
FREE COLLEGE FOR ALL OR DO YOU

01:16:32.721 --> 01:16:37.893 region:rollup2
EXPECT SOME INDIVIDUALS TO PAY

01:16:35.024 --> 01:16:38.561 region:rollup2
FOR THEIR COST OF EDUCATION.

01:16:37.893 --> 01:16:40.229 region:rollup2
THOMAS OTHERS ARE THAT ARE GOING

01:16:38.561 --> 01:16:40.529 region:rollup2
TO HAVE DIFFERENT IN A POLICY

01:16:40.229 --> 01:16:43.966 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:16:40.529 --> 01:16:45.201 region:rollup2
OCCASIONS THERE --

01:16:43.966 --> 01:16:46.836 region:rollup2
I I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT TO POINT

01:16:45.201 --> 01:16:48.637 region:rollup2
OUT THAT.

01:16:46.836 --> 01:16:50.372 region:rollup2
YOU NO YOU DON'T LIVE IN AN

01:16:48.637 --> 01:16:51.474 region:rollup2
IDEAL WORLD WHERE YOU HAVE.

01:16:50.372 --> 01:16:53.109 region:rollup2
ALL THE RESOURCES THAT YOU

01:16:51.474 --> 01:16:54.543 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY WANT TO WORK WITH

01:16:53.109 --> 01:16:56.612 region:rollup2
AND YOU CANNOT PERFECTLY PREDICT

01:16:54.543 --> 01:16:57.913 region:rollup2
WHATTHE BUDGET IS GOING TO BE.

01:16:56.612 --> 01:16:59.682 region:rollup2
FIVE YEARS OUT AND IN SOME CASES

01:16:57.913 --> 01:17:01.317 region:rollup2
IN OUR OFFICE.

01:16:59.682 --> 01:17:02.451 region:rollup2
IN WE WE DO FORECAST EVERY YEAR

OFTHE BUDGET --

01:17:02.451 --> 01:17:04.520 region:rollup2
AND EVEN PREDICTING WHEN YOU'RE

01:17:03.285 --> 01:17:06.322 region:rollup2
OUT THERE IS UNCERTAINTY

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:07.790 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT.

01:17:06.322 --> 01:17:09.925 region:rollup2
SO YOU DO HAVE TO YOU TO FACE

01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:11.060 region:rollup2
THAT REALITY IN A WE RECOMMEND

01:17:09.925 --> 01:17:12.661 region:rollup2
STARTING A RESERVE EVERY YEAR IN

01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:15.097 region:rollup2
THE BUDGET.

01:17:12.661 --> 01:17:16.732 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE EXACT LEVEL OF RESERVE

01:17:15.097 --> 01:17:18.267 region:rollup2
YOU SHOULD SET YOU KNOW IS OPEN

01:17:16.732 --> 01:17:20.169 region:rollup2
TO DEBATE AND IT'S GONNA INVOLVE

01:17:18.267 --> 01:17:21.237 region:rollup2
YOUR PRIORITIES IN THAT YEAR.

01:17:20.169 --> 01:17:22.271 region:rollup2
BOB YOU ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY

01:17:21.237 --> 01:17:24.440 region:rollup2
AND THE LEGISLATURE'S DONE THIS

01:17:22.271 --> 01:17:27.042 region:rollup2
IN THE PAST IT DID YOU KNOW KEEP

01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:28.444 region:rollup2
ONGOING PRIORITIES DOWN AND AND

01:17:27.042 --> 01:17:29.745 region:rollup2
WE COMMIT SOME FUNDING TO ONE

01:17:28.444 --> 01:17:31.247 region:rollup2
TIME PRIORITIES WHEN TIMES ARE

01:17:29.745 --> 01:17:33.215 region:rollup2
REALLY GOD KNOWS HER. TWO WAYS

01:17:31.247 --> 01:17:33.849 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE HAS DONE THAT.

01:17:33.215 --> 01:17:35.284 region:rollup2
ON BUT AGAIN YOU THERE'S ALWAYS

01:17:33.849 --> 01:17:36.151 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE SOME UNCERTAINTY

01:17:35.284 --> 01:17:37.553 region:rollup2
WITH THEBUDGET THERE YOU REYES

01:17:36.151 --> 01:17:38.988 region:rollup2
ARE A KIND OF PRE NO QUESTION

01:17:37.553 --> 01:17:40.556 region:rollup2
FOR THE LEGISLATURE WHICH IS.

01:17:38.988 --> 01:17:41.757 region:rollup2
HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU BUDGET FOR

01:17:40.556 --> 01:17:43.225 region:rollup2
SOMETHING ABOUT HOW DO YOU HAVE

01:17:41.757 --> 01:17:44.159 region:rollup2
A LONG TERM VISION WHEN IT'S

01:17:43.225 --> 01:17:45.294 region:rollup2
HARD TO PROJECT PREDICT THE

01:17:44.159 --> 01:17:46.762 region:rollup2
FUTURE?

01:17:45.294 --> 01:17:47.429 region:rollup2
AND SOMETHING THAT WE STRUGGLE

01:17:46.762 --> 01:17:48.731 region:rollup2
WITH IN THE YOU KNOW THE OFFICE

01:17:47.429 --> 01:17:50.332 region:rollup2
AS WE TRY TO ADVISE YOU ON THESE

01:17:48.731 --> 01:17:52.034 region:rollup2
ISSUES BUT I THINK AGAIN YOU

01:17:50.332 --> 01:17:52.568 region:rollup2
KNOW IT'S IT'S SETTING ASIDE

01:17:52.034 --> 01:17:53.769 region:rollup2
FUNDING EVERY YEAR IN THE

01:17:52.568 --> 01:17:54.770 region:rollup2
BUDGET.

01:17:53.769 --> 01:17:56.172 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU KNOW

01:17:54.770 --> 01:17:57.139 region:rollup2
WHEN TIMES ARE REALLY GOOD

01:17:56.172 --> 01:17:58.474 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT SOME OF THE ONE

01:17:57.139 --> 01:17:59.942 region:rollup2
TIME YOU KNOW PRIORITIES AND

01:17:58.474 --> 01:18:00.809 region:rollup2
LIABILITIES IN THE STATE AND

01:17:59.942 --> 01:18:01.610 region:rollup2
PAYING THOSE DOWN.

01:18:00.809 --> 01:18:02.711 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE THOSE ARE SOME

01:18:01.610 --> 01:18:03.679 region:rollup2
PRACTICES THAT YOU HAVE AT YOUR

01:18:02.711 --> 01:18:05.247 region:rollup2
DISPOSAL.

01:18:03.679 --> 01:18:06.148 region:rollup2
AND THEN THINKING ABOUT YOUR

01:18:05.247 --> 01:18:08.417 region:rollup2
PRIORITIES IN WHICH WOULD LIKE

01:18:06.148 --> 01:18:09.585 region:rollup2
TO FUND IF YOU OF YOU KNOW WHAT

01:18:08.417 --> 01:18:11.654 region:rollup2
SHOULD THE SHARE OF COSTS BE

01:18:09.585 --> 01:18:12.254 region:rollup2
SHOULD IT BE FREE EDUCATION FOR

01:18:11.654 --> 01:18:13.689 region:rollup2
ALL SHOULD SOME STUDENTS BE

01:18:12.254 --> 01:18:14.657 region:rollup2
EXPECTED THEIR SHARE THE COST OF

01:18:13.689 --> 01:18:15.457 region:rollup2
THEIR EDUCATION.

01:18:14.657 --> 01:18:18.427 region:rollup2
THAT'S GONNA FALL MORE ON WHAT

01:18:15.457 --> 01:18:19.361 region:rollup2
YOUR PRIORITIES THINK THE

01:18:18.427 --> 01:18:20.996 region:rollup2
STATE'S ROLE ISM AND FUNDING

01:18:19.361 --> 01:18:22.231 region:rollup2
HIGHER EDUCATION THAT YOU KNOW

01:18:20.996 --> 01:18:23.432 region:rollup2
COULD DIFFER DEPENDING ON WHAT

01:18:22.231 --> 01:18:24.567 region:rollup2
YOUR PRIORITIES ARE.

01:18:23.432 --> 01:18:26.802 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS I

01:18:24.567 --> 01:18:28.103 region:rollup2
FIND -- A I

01:18:26.802 --> 01:18:30.506 region:rollup2
GUESS IT'S LIKE.

01:18:28.103 --> 01:18:31.774 region:rollup2
SOME KIND OF A MAGIC FINANCING

01:18:30.506 --> 01:18:34.543 region:rollup2
THE WHATEVER IT IS.

01:18:31.774 --> 01:18:36.779 region:rollup2
FOR US THAT WE ARE THAT WE HAVE

01:18:34.543 --> 01:18:38.847 region:rollup2
MONEY.

01:18:36.779 --> 01:18:40.983 region:rollup2
THAT WE PUT INTO FINANCIAL A

01:18:38.847 --> 01:18:42.551 region:rollup2
OKAY AND THEN TURN AROUND AND DO

01:18:40.983 --> 01:18:43.986 region:rollup2
SOME OTHER THINGS TOO SO THAT IN

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:44.987 region:rollup2
THE END.

01:18:43.986 --> 01:18:47.823 region:rollup2
THOSE OF PAYING.

01:18:44.987 --> 01:18:49.225 region:rollup2
FOR PAYING SOME FEES I PAYING IN

01:18:47.823 --> 01:18:50.726 region:rollup2
FOR THE FINANCIAL AID I ASSUME

01:18:49.225 --> 01:18:52.795 region:rollup2
OF OTHERS AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK

01:18:50.726 --> 01:18:54.830 region:rollup2
AT IT IT'S ALL THIS MONEY THIS

01:18:52.795 --> 01:18:55.397 region:rollup2
FLOAT AROUND HERE IT EVEN IN OUR

01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:57.533 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL AID.

01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:59.134 region:rollup2
AREA OF THAT IF WE DIDN'T DO

01:18:57.533 --> 01:19:00.002 region:rollup2
THAT AT ALL.

01:18:59.134 --> 01:19:02.238 region:rollup2
AND PUT IT ALL BACK INTO THE

01:19:00.002 --> 01:19:03.772 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

01:19:02.238 --> 01:19:06.308 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN GIVING OUT SOME

01:19:03.772 --> 01:19:08.110 region:rollup2
FINANCE A TO A FEW.

01:19:06.308 --> 01:19:10.312 region:rollup2
A BUT THE P. WOULD PROBABLY SEE

01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:11.213 region:rollup2
IT MORE AS A FREE EDUCATION.

01:19:10.312 --> 01:19:12.548 region:rollup2
NO ONE OF THE THINGS IT SEEMS

01:19:11.213 --> 01:19:13.515 region:rollup2
WHEN I'M TALKING TO PEOPLE AND

01:19:12.548 --> 01:19:15.351 region:rollup2
I'M SAYING WELL.

01:19:13.515 --> 01:19:16.218 region:rollup2
OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES IS ALMOST

01:19:15.351 --> 01:19:18.153 region:rollup2
FREE WE DON'T YOU KNOW BECAUSE

01:19:16.218 --> 01:19:19.655 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY THE GET A BOB GRANT OR

01:19:18.153 --> 01:19:22.191 region:rollup2
SALT WATER SOME THAT PAYS FOR

01:19:19.655 --> 01:19:24.360 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING OR YOU GO TO THE I

01:19:22.191 --> 01:19:25.861 region:rollup2
KNOW WE HAVE THE DREAM GROUP NOW

01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:27.062 region:rollup2
IT'S HE SEES YOU.

01:19:25.861 --> 01:19:29.098 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE SOME OF THE STUFF

01:19:27.062 --> 01:19:30.866 region:rollup2
THAT AND SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT

01:19:29.098 --> 01:19:32.234 region:rollup2
IT BECOMES VERY CONFUSING WITH

01:19:30.866 --> 01:19:33.469 region:rollup2
THIS CHART WHERE.

01:19:32.234 --> 01:19:36.038 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW STUDENTS ARE PAYING

01:19:33.469 --> 01:19:39.441 region:rollup2
THIS BUT IN REALITY WE PAID IT.

01:19:36.038 --> 01:19:40.809 region:rollup2
AND SO AND IT ALL GETS TWISTED

01:19:39.441 --> 01:19:41.477 region:rollup2
AROUND AND I'M SO SO.

01:19:40.809 --> 01:19:42.845 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH DO PEOPLE REALLY PAY TO

01:19:41.477 --> 01:19:44.747 region:rollup2
GO TO SCHOOL?

01:19:42.845 --> 01:19:46.282 region:rollup2
OKAY AND DO THAT IF YOU KNOW HOW

01:19:44.747 --> 01:19:47.883 region:rollup2
MUCH DID DID IT REALLY COST THE

01:19:46.282 --> 01:19:49.418 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

01:19:47.883 --> 01:19:51.654 region:rollup2
ALL OF US GIVING BACK TO THEM

01:19:49.418 --> 01:19:53.589 region:rollup2
WHAT WE CHARGE THEM.

01:19:51.654 --> 01:19:54.723 region:rollup2
ILL A SO I'M JUST GONNA.

01:19:53.589 --> 01:19:56.325 region:rollup2
HE'LL FIGURE OUT A SIMPLE WAY TO

01:19:54.723 --> 01:19:58.293 region:rollup2
DO THIS.

01:19:56.325 --> 01:19:59.495 region:rollup2
AS AS WELL AS MIGHT INSPIRE US

01:19:58.293 --> 01:20:01.196 region:rollup2
TO DO MORE.

01:19:59.495 --> 01:20:02.665 region:rollup2
OF BECAUSE WE HEAR ABOUT THE

01:20:01.196 --> 01:20:04.033 region:rollup2
TREMENDOUS TUITION STUDENTS ARE

01:20:02.665 --> 01:20:05.234 region:rollup2
PAYING AND IT'S THERE BUT THEN

01:20:04.033 --> 01:20:07.936 region:rollup2
WE HEAR ABOUT THE INCREASE IN

01:20:05.234 --> 01:20:08.937 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL A AND ANYTIME WE

01:20:07.936 --> 01:20:09.938 region:rollup2
INCREASE FEES WILL INCREASE

01:20:08.937 --> 01:20:10.239 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE

01:20:09.938 --> 01:20:13.542 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:20:10.239 --> 01:20:14.076 region:rollup2
SO.

01:20:13.542 --> 01:20:15.611 region:rollup2
WHO IS REALLY PAN TO GO TO

01:20:14.076 --> 01:20:16.578 region:rollup2
SCHOOL?

01:20:15.611 --> 01:20:18.447 region:rollup2
I MEAN THAT I THINK THAT'S A

01:20:16.578 --> 01:20:19.648 region:rollup2
QUESTION AND WE STRIP OPET WEEK

01:20:18.447 --> 01:20:22.084 region:rollup2
IF WE GAVE NO FINANCIAL AID AT

01:20:19.648 --> 01:20:23.619 region:rollup2
ALL.

01:20:22.084 --> 01:20:24.753 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN IN TERMS

01:20:23.619 --> 01:20:26.055 region:rollup2
THAT POT OF MONEY THAT'S IN

01:20:24.753 --> 01:20:27.690 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL AID?

01:20:26.055 --> 01:20:29.992 region:rollup2
THAT NOW GOES INTO THE SYSTEM

01:20:27.690 --> 01:20:30.559 region:rollup2
ITSELF TO FUND STUDENTS.

01:20:29.992 --> 01:20:32.328 region:rollup2
WHAT WILL WHAT WOULD IT LOOK

01:20:30.559 --> 01:20:33.929 region:rollup2
LIKE?

01:20:32.328 --> 01:20:34.963 region:rollup2
IF ANYBODY ASK THEMSELVES THAT

01:20:33.929 --> 01:20:36.165 region:rollup2
HAVE YOU GUYS AS A QUESTION

FINANCE WAY BACK INTO THE

01:20:37.866 --> 01:20:40.536 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

01:20:39.134 --> 01:20:44.273 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'VE BEEN HAVE TO CHARGE

01:20:40.536 --> 01:20:45.708 region:rollup2
STUDENTS TO GO TO SCHOOL?

01:20:44.273 --> 01:20:47.176 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I HAD I DON'T HAVE AN

01:20:45.708 --> 01:20:49.311 region:rollup2
ESTIMATE ON THAT ON IN YOUR

01:20:47.176 --> 01:20:50.746 region:rollup2
FINANCIALLY PANEL --

01:20:49.311 --> 01:20:51.947 region:rollup2
WE DO HAVE A HANDOUT WERE

01:20:50.746 --> 01:20:52.848 region:rollup2
REDESCRIBED --

01:20:51.947 --> 01:20:55.584 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU FACTOR IN [inaudible]

01:20:52.848 --> 01:20:56.985 region:rollup2
OF THE VERY IT NOT ONLY OF THE

01:20:55.584 --> 01:20:58.620 region:rollup2
STATE SUBSIDY BUT ALSO STATE

01:20:56.985 --> 01:20:59.621 region:rollup2
FUNDING FOR FINANCIAL AID AND

01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:01.156 region:rollup2
KNOCKING OUT.

01:20:59.621 --> 01:21:02.991 region:rollup2
THE TUITION DISCOUNTS THAT

01:21:01.156 --> 01:21:04.793 region:rollup2
STUDENTS GET RIGHT HOW MUCH IT

01:21:02.991 --> 01:21:05.861 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS ARE

01:21:04.793 --> 01:21:07.029 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY PAYING UNITS IT'S LESS

01:21:05.861 --> 01:21:09.331 region:rollup2
THAN I THINK PEOPLE REALIZE

01:21:07.029 --> 01:21:11.533 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES IT'S ON OF THE NUMBERS

01:21:09.331 --> 01:21:12.301 region:rollup2
AND FROM ME BUT IT'S LIKE 5% OF

01:21:11.533 --> 01:21:15.104 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND

01:21:12.301 --> 01:21:16.739 region:rollup2
THAT'S MAYBE ROUND 17230% AT UC

01:21:15.104 --> 01:21:17.673 region:rollup2
AND CSU AT THE ACTUAL.

01:21:16.739 --> 01:21:21.176 region:rollup2
NUMBERS ARE IN YOUR HAND OUT SO

01:21:17.673 --> 01:21:22.911 region:rollup2
I WOULD DEFER TO THE BUT ON I

01:21:21.176 --> 01:21:24.446 region:rollup2
SAY WE HAVE DONE THAT EXERCISE

01:21:22.911 --> 01:21:26.415 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF IF WE WOULDA.

01:21:24.446 --> 01:21:28.016 region:rollup2
IF WE WERE TO PUT FINANCIAL AID

01:21:26.415 --> 01:21:29.952 region:rollup2
ALL OF THEM FUNDING BACK IS A

01:21:28.016 --> 01:21:32.054 region:rollup2
DIRECT SUBSIDY FOR THOSE IT OF

01:21:29.952 --> 01:21:33.422 region:rollup2
SEGMENTS.

01:21:32.054 --> 01:21:34.723 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WOULD STUDENT

01:21:33.422 --> 01:21:36.792 region:rollup2
CHARGES BE ADJUSTED TO AYE AYE

01:21:34.723 --> 01:21:37.559 region:rollup2
THAT I DON'T HAVE THAT IN FRONT

01:21:36.792 --> 01:21:39.328 region:rollup2
OF ME BUT THAT YOU KNOW THAT

01:21:37.559 --> 01:21:40.129 region:rollup2
IT'S A CALCULATION MAYBE YOU

01:21:39.328 --> 01:21:41.296 region:rollup2
COULD DO IF.

01:21:40.129 --> 01:21:42.398 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THINKING FOR A LITTLE

01:21:41.296 --> 01:21:44.166 region:rollup2
BIT BUT I DON'T HAVE THAT THAT

01:21:42.398 --> 01:21:45.033 region:rollup2
ESTIMATE FROM ME BUT I MEAN THIS

01:21:44.166 --> 01:21:46.335 region:rollup2
IS ONE OF THOSE WHO QUESTIONS

01:21:45.033 --> 01:21:47.603 region:rollup2
HOUSE AT BECAUSE I WAS HE ABOUT

01:21:46.335 --> 01:21:48.837 region:rollup2
THE FINANCIAL AID PACKAGE I

01:21:47.603 --> 01:21:49.772 region:rollup2
HEREBY WILL BE CHARGED HERE BY

01:21:48.837 --> 01:21:50.672 region:rollup2
THE FINANCIAL AID.

01:21:49.772 --> 01:21:51.807 region:rollup2
HERE BUT SOMETHING ELSE AND

01:21:50.672 --> 01:21:54.176 region:rollup2
SOMETHING ELSE AND SO I'M I'M

01:21:51.807 --> 01:21:54.743 region:rollup2
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW

01:21:54.176 --> 01:21:55.511 region:rollup2
MUCH OF MOST STUDENTS REALLY

01:21:54.743 --> 01:21:58.046 region:rollup2
PAYING.

01:21:55.511 --> 01:22:00.315 region:rollup2
AND AND IS IT REASONABLE TO SAY

01:21:58.046 --> 01:22:00.949 region:rollup2
THAT WE ARE CHARGING TUITION.

01:22:00.315 --> 01:22:03.051 region:rollup2
AND THEN PAYING FOR AT THE SAME

01:22:00.949 --> 01:22:03.352 region:rollup2
TIME.

01:22:03.051 --> 01:22:05.320 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW --

01:22:03.352 --> 01:22:05.954 region:rollup2
SO THAT.

01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:07.723 region:rollup2
WE'RE GIVING THE STUDENTS WHAT

01:22:05.954 --> 01:22:09.992 region:rollup2
WE CHARGING AN EXACT AND A

01:22:07.723 --> 01:22:11.460 region:rollup2
REALIZATION OF THAT UNTIL OF

01:22:09.992 --> 01:22:13.028 region:rollup2
SOMEONE MENTION WELL THOUGH.

01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:16.131 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL VIA TUITIONS WILL

01:22:13.028 --> 01:22:16.999 region:rollup2
INCREASE BUT DON'T WORRY ABOUT

01:22:16.131 --> 01:22:17.966 region:rollup2
IT BECAUSE WE GOT A CUP IN

01:22:16.999 --> 01:22:19.368 region:rollup2
FINANCE RIGHT.

01:22:17.966 --> 01:22:20.335 region:rollup2
SOME SAM WILL WHY WOULD WE

01:22:19.368 --> 01:22:22.571 region:rollup2
INCREASE THE TUITION IF YOU ARE

01:22:20.335 --> 01:22:23.172 region:rollup2
GOING TO TURN AROUND AND PUT IT

01:22:22.571 --> 01:22:23.806 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL AID THIS GOT PAPER I

01:22:23.172 --> 01:22:25.040 region:rollup2
MEAN.

01:22:23.806 --> 01:22:26.942 region:rollup2
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU'RE

01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:28.343 region:rollup2
ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS --

01:22:26.942 --> 01:22:30.145 region:rollup2
AND THE LAST POINT THAT I WAS

01:22:28.343 --> 01:22:32.648 region:rollup2
MAKING ABOUT TRANSPARENCY OF

01:22:30.145 --> 01:22:34.783 region:rollup2
INFORMATION AND BEING ABLE.

01:22:32.648 --> 01:22:36.118 region:rollup2
TO GET PRECISELY THE ANSWERS TO

01:22:34.783 --> 01:22:37.553 region:rollup2
THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU'RE POSING

01:22:36.118 --> 01:22:38.954 region:rollup2
IN IS EXACTLY WHAT WE WOULD

01:22:37.553 --> 01:22:40.155 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND WE THINK THAT THERE

01:22:38.954 --> 01:22:41.523 region:rollup2
ARE CERTAIN METRICS.

01:22:40.155 --> 01:22:43.258 region:rollup2
THAT ARE NOT.

01:22:41.523 --> 01:22:44.927 region:rollup2
EASILY UNDERSTOOD AND THEY'RE

01:22:43.258 --> 01:22:45.961 region:rollup2
NOT UNDERSTOOD ACROSS SYSTEMS SO

01:22:44.927 --> 01:22:48.430 region:rollup2
HOW CAN WE ACTUALLY BRING SOME

01:22:45.961 --> 01:22:50.732 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY AND SOME --

01:22:48.430 --> 01:22:52.467 region:rollup2
UNIFORMITY TO THE WAY IN WHICH

01:22:50.732 --> 01:22:54.036 region:rollup2
WE MEASURE THE SING SO NUMBER

01:22:52.467 --> 01:22:54.937 region:rollup2
ONE I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU

01:22:54.036 --> 01:22:57.406 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB

01:22:54.937 --> 01:22:58.540 region:rollup2
OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE THE

01:22:57.406 --> 01:23:00.576 region:rollup2
FACTORS ARE --

01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:02.544 region:rollup2
LATE.

01:23:00.576 --> 01:23:04.646 region:rollup2
AND THEN ASKING BOLD QUESTIONS

01:23:02.544 --> 01:23:06.682 region:rollup2
LIKE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN FACT

01:23:04.646 --> 01:23:08.350 region:rollup2
IF WE WERE TO GIVE THE FINANCIAL

01:23:06.682 --> 01:23:08.951 region:rollup2
THEY GIVE THAT MONEY BACK TO THE

01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:09.818 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WHAT DOES THAT DO TO

01:23:08.951 --> 01:23:10.886 region:rollup2
TUITION.

01:23:09.818 --> 01:23:12.087 region:rollup2
I MEAN OFF THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD

01:23:10.886 --> 01:23:13.388 region:rollup2
YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT THE TUITION

01:23:12.087 --> 01:23:14.857 region:rollup2
INCREASES WOULD BE AND THEN WHAT

01:23:13.388 --> 01:23:16.391 region:rollup2
WOULD BE THE PUBLIC RESPONSE TO

01:23:14.857 --> 01:23:17.759 region:rollup2
THAT BUT THOSE ARE EXACTLY THE

01:23:16.391 --> 01:23:19.461 region:rollup2
KINDS OF ANSWERS THAT WE THINK

01:23:17.759 --> 01:23:21.129 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE AUSTIN AND ANSWERED

01:23:19.461 --> 01:23:22.631 region:rollup2
AND THE NEXT.

01:23:21.129 --> 01:23:24.266 region:rollup2
PANEL OF COURSE IS GOING.

01:23:22.631 --> 01:23:25.000 region:rollup2
TO PICK THIS UP BEEN THOSE OF

01:23:24.266 --> 01:23:26.702 region:rollup2
THE EXPERTS.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.770 region:rollup2
THAT OF COURSE FINANCIALLY

01:23:26.702 --> 01:23:30.405 region:rollup2
DOESN'T COVER TOTAL COST OF

01:23:28.770 --> 01:23:31.540 region:rollup2
ATTENDANCE WHICH IS THE OTHER

01:23:30.405 --> 01:23:33.408 region:rollup2
THING THAT WE NEED TO BE.

01:23:31.540 --> 01:23:35.344 region:rollup2
FRONT VERY THOUGHTFUL OF BUT I

01:23:33.408 --> 01:23:37.412 region:rollup2
LOVE MY THING IS THAT IF IF WE

01:23:35.344 --> 01:23:38.247 region:rollup2
GET AWAY FINANCE WAITING GAVE

01:23:37.412 --> 01:23:40.115 region:rollup2
THE MONEY TO THE INSTITUTIONS.

01:23:38.247 --> 01:23:41.516 region:rollup2
THE FEES WOULD DECREASE NOT

01:23:40.115 --> 01:23:43.986 region:rollup2
INCREASE BECAUSE THAT MONEY

01:23:41.516 --> 01:23:44.786 region:rollup2
WOULD GO TO BASICALLY DO WHAT

01:23:43.986 --> 01:23:46.154 region:rollup2
IT'S DOING NOT ME.

01:23:44.786 --> 01:23:47.456 region:rollup2
IT YOU GIVING THAT MONEY TO THE

01:23:46.154 --> 01:23:49.558 region:rollup2
STUDENTS TO GIVE TO THE

01:23:47.456 --> 01:23:51.660 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITIES OR WHOMEVER

01:23:49.558 --> 01:23:53.629 region:rollup2
WHATEVER THIS IS AND SO THAT

01:23:51.660 --> 01:23:55.163 region:rollup2
MONEY THEN IT'S LIKE.

01:23:53.629 --> 01:23:55.831 region:rollup2
WE GAVE OUR MONEY THEY TURN ON

01:23:55.163 --> 01:23:56.632 region:rollup2
GAVE IT BACK TO THE INSTITUTION

01:23:55.831 --> 01:23:59.468 region:rollup2
THAT WE COULD HAVE GIVEN TO

01:23:56.632 --> 01:24:00.102 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY. TO EDUCATE KIDS SO

01:23:59.468 --> 01:24:05.040 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING YOU KNOW I

01:24:00.102 --> 01:24:06.842 region:rollup2
MEAN IT'S IT'S IT'S I WAS A FAKE

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:08.277 region:rollup2
NEWS A FAKE INFORMATION BECAUSE

01:24:06.842 --> 01:24:09.945 region:rollup2
THIS TO POLITICAL BUT HAVE --

01:24:08.277 --> 01:24:11.446 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S BUT IT'S IT'S NOT AS

01:24:09.945 --> 01:24:12.648 region:rollup2
CLEAR AS I IS IT COULD BE MORE

01:24:11.446 --> 01:24:14.049 region:rollup2
IMPORTANTLY I'M NOT SURE OF IS

01:24:12.648 --> 01:24:15.751 region:rollup2
THAT THE ACTIVE AS IT SHOULD BE.

01:24:14.049 --> 01:24:17.586 region:rollup2
A AND IT DOESN'T REALLY GIVE US

01:24:15.751 --> 01:24:19.555 region:rollup2
A FULL SENSE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING

01:24:17.586 --> 01:24:20.522 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF EDUCATING KIDS HOW

01:24:19.555 --> 01:24:22.157 region:rollup2
MUCH MONEY WERE ACTUALLY PUTTING

01:24:20.522 --> 01:24:23.191 region:rollup2
INTO THOSE SYSTEMS.

01:24:22.157 --> 01:24:25.394 region:rollup2
THAT -- AND

01:24:23.191 --> 01:24:26.828 region:rollup2
THAT MONEY WOULD BE USED TO RUN

01:24:25.394 --> 01:24:27.829 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM SO THAT THAT THEY

01:24:26.828 --> 01:24:29.064 region:rollup2
COULD NOT ALL OF A SUDDEN

01:24:27.829 --> 01:24:30.565 region:rollup2
INCREASE TUITION.

01:24:29.064 --> 01:24:33.302 region:rollup2
UP BECAUSE IF THEY WANT INCREASE

01:24:30.565 --> 01:24:34.469 region:rollup2
TUITION WHEN MAY INCREASE

01:24:33.302 --> 01:24:37.339 region:rollup2
TUITION WE PAY FOR IT ANYWAY.

01:24:34.469 --> 01:24:37.973 region:rollup2
OKAY SO AS A RESULT --

01:24:37.339 --> 01:24:39.441 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE MONEY IS STILL THE

01:24:37.973 --> 01:24:40.742 region:rollup2
IT'S ALL THE SAME MONEY ROAMING

01:24:39.441 --> 01:24:42.678 region:rollup2
AROUND IN THE SAME POT.

01:24:40.742 --> 01:24:43.845 region:rollup2
OTHER MAYBE OTHER RESOURCES ARE

01:24:42.678 --> 01:24:44.513 region:rollup2
BETTER AT PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS

01:24:43.845 --> 01:24:45.981 region:rollup2
AND SO FORTH AND SO ON THAT WE

01:24:44.513 --> 01:24:47.115 region:rollup2
FIND IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY BUT

01:24:45.981 --> 01:24:48.750 region:rollup2
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE THE

01:24:47.115 --> 01:24:50.485 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES THAT WE HAVE THIS ISSUE

01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:52.387 region:rollup2
THE UC'S AND OTHERS.

01:24:50.485 --> 01:24:53.989 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IF WE IF WE GIVEN THE

01:24:52.387 --> 01:24:55.857 region:rollup2
BOB GRANT INSTEAD OF GIVING THE

01:24:53.989 --> 01:24:57.359 region:rollup2
BOB GRANT TO PAY FOR THE SO

01:24:55.857 --> 01:24:57.926 region:rollup2
CALLED TUITION THAT STUDENTS

01:24:57.359 --> 01:25:00.028 region:rollup2
HAVE.

01:24:57.926 --> 01:25:00.829 region:rollup2
FORGIVEN STRUGGLING TO DIRECTLY

01:25:00.028 --> 01:25:02.664 region:rollup2
TO THE INSTITUTIONS HERE'S THE

01:25:00.829 --> 01:25:03.265 region:rollup2
MONEY TO RUN THE INSTITUTION AND

01:25:02.664 --> 01:25:04.299 region:rollup2
ALL.

01:25:03.265 --> 01:25:07.469 region:rollup2
AND THEN THAT MAY GIVE US A

01:25:04.299 --> 01:25:09.104 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE WE NEED TO CLOSE THE

01:25:07.469 --> 01:25:10.172 region:rollup2
GAP TO HAVE FREE TUITION

01:25:09.104 --> 01:25:12.074 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY.

01:25:10.172 --> 01:25:13.909 region:rollup2
I IN SOME PLACES IT MAY BE CLOSE

01:25:12.074 --> 01:25:15.744 region:rollup2
IN SOME COMMITTEE COLLEGES A C.

01:25:13.909 --> 01:25:16.178 region:rollup2
ISSUE SO I STILL HAVE SOME GAPS

01:25:15.744 --> 01:25:17.779 region:rollup2
THAT OF THE YEAR.

01:25:16.178 --> 01:25:19.348 region:rollup2
THAT ARE MADE UP BY FEDERAL

01:25:17.779 --> 01:25:21.783 region:rollup2
GRANTS AND SO FORTH AND SO ON

01:25:19.348 --> 01:25:23.919 region:rollup2
BUT BUT IT JUST SEEMS STRANGE TO

01:25:21.783 --> 01:25:25.620 region:rollup2
ME THAT WE ARE AN INSTITUTION

01:25:23.919 --> 01:25:27.055 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE THESE UNIVERSITIES.

01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:29.124 region:rollup2
AND THAT WE HAVE THE SPECIES WE

01:25:27.055 --> 01:25:31.059 region:rollup2
CHARGE THEM AND THEN WE PAY FOR

01:25:29.124 --> 01:25:32.227 region:rollup2
THOSE FEES UP WITH FINANCIAL AID

01:25:31.059 --> 01:25:33.862 region:rollup2
A CLEARLY SOME STUDENTS DON'T

01:25:32.227 --> 01:25:35.063 region:rollup2
QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL AID.

01:25:33.862 --> 01:25:37.232 region:rollup2
AND THAT MAY BE A VARIABLE IN

01:25:35.063 --> 01:25:38.567 region:rollup2
DETERMINING WHAT STUDENTS PAY IF

01:25:37.232 --> 01:25:40.002 region:rollup2
WE PAY FOR EVERYTHING WHAT

01:25:38.567 --> 01:25:41.503 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WHICH STUDENTS WHO

01:25:40.002 --> 01:25:42.971 region:rollup2
WOULD WEBSITE INCOME HAVE TO PAY

01:25:41.503 --> 01:25:45.674 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL FEES OR SOMETHING.

01:25:42.971 --> 01:25:46.875 region:rollup2
THAT MIGHT BE THERE BUT IT JUST

01:25:45.674 --> 01:25:48.043 region:rollup2
SEEMS LIKE IT'S IT'S MONEY

01:25:46.875 --> 01:25:50.379 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOING IN A CIRCLE.

01:25:48.043 --> 01:25:51.480 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AND AND AS A RESULT I'M

01:25:50.379 --> 01:25:53.281 region:rollup2
NOT SURE WITH THAT AS EFFECTIVE

01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:53.682 region:rollup2
AS WE COULD BE IN PLANNING THAT

01:25:53.281 --> 01:25:55.083 region:rollup2
MONEY.

01:25:53.682 --> 01:25:56.618 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF ALL THE THINGS WE

01:25:55.083 --> 01:25:58.720 region:rollup2
THINK WE SHOULD DO IN ORDER TO

01:25:56.618 --> 01:26:00.422 region:rollup2
FINANCE THE SYSTEM.

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:01.456 region:rollup2
AND I I DID WANT TO NOTE TWO

01:26:00.422 --> 01:26:03.425 region:rollup2
THINGS --

01:26:01.456 --> 01:26:04.993 region:rollup2
THAT I WON IT BY UNDERSTOOD

01:26:03.425 --> 01:26:06.628 region:rollup2
WHATEVER QUESTIONS WAS.

01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:07.896 region:rollup2
NOW AFTER FINANCIAL AID WHAT IT

01:26:06.628 --> 01:26:08.864 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY COST UNITS TO GO TO

01:26:07.896 --> 01:26:10.666 region:rollup2
COLLEGE IN THERE ARE ESTIMATES

01:26:08.864 --> 01:26:12.401 region:rollup2
OF THAT AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE A

01:26:10.666 --> 01:26:14.102 region:rollup2
TABLE IN THE NEXT PANEL THAT

01:26:12.401 --> 01:26:15.337 region:rollup2
THAT SHOWS COST PER STUDENT SO

01:26:14.102 --> 01:26:16.571 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY REVIEW

01:26:15.337 --> 01:26:17.639 region:rollup2
THAT TABLE THAT MIGHT.

01:26:16.571 --> 01:26:19.474 region:rollup2
GET AT SOME OF THE QUESTIONS YOU

01:26:17.639 --> 01:26:21.777 region:rollup2
HAVE IN THAT AT GUESS THAT DEALS

01:26:19.474 --> 01:26:23.045 region:rollup2
WITH BOOKS MAYBE I'M LEFT FEES

01:26:21.777 --> 01:26:23.879 region:rollup2
OCCASIONALLY RIGHT BUT BUT WE

01:26:23.045 --> 01:26:24.813 region:rollup2
PROBABLY PAY LAB FEES IF WE PUT

01:26:23.879 --> 01:26:25.981 region:rollup2
THE MONEY IN IT.

01:26:24.813 --> 01:26:27.749 region:rollup2
A WE MAY HAVE TO PAY ME AT THE

01:26:25.981 --> 01:26:29.785 region:rollup2
PAPER BOOKS AND OF COURSE IF

01:26:27.749 --> 01:26:31.086 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T LIVE ON CAMPUS THAT

01:26:29.785 --> 01:26:40.695 region:rollup2
HAVE TO PAY FOR LODGING.

01:26:31.086 --> 01:26:41.329 region:rollup2
OKAY I ASSUME SO OF THAT THOSE

01:26:40.695 --> 01:26:41.997 region:rollup2
ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT TO

01:26:41.329 --> 01:26:42.597 region:rollup2
ME WE NEED CELLS IN TERMS OF HOW

01:26:41.997 --> 01:26:42.931 region:rollup2
WE'RE CURRENTLY FINANCING IT

01:26:42.597 --> 01:26:43.532 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN.

01:26:42.931 --> 01:26:44.199 region:rollup2
JUST FIGURED WE NEED TO FIND

01:26:43.532 --> 01:26:44.866 region:rollup2
SOME MORE REVENUE SOMEWHERE ELSE

01:26:44.199 --> 01:26:45.834 region:rollup2
WHICH WOULD PROBABLY DO BUT ALSO

01:26:44.866 --> 01:26:46.968 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW HAVING A A SPECIAL FUND

01:26:45.834 --> 01:26:48.370 region:rollup2
FOR THE RAINY DAY.

01:26:46.968 --> 01:26:49.538 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WILL PROBABLY NEVER HAVE

01:26:48.370 --> 01:26:51.073 region:rollup2
ENOUGH MONEY IN THE RAINY DAY

01:26:49.538 --> 01:26:51.707 region:rollup2
FUND TO ACTUALLY.

01:26:51.073 --> 01:26:54.009 region:rollup2
HAVE A REAL RAIN ON US A AND SO

01:26:51.707 --> 01:26:55.711 region:rollup2
--

01:26:54.009 --> 01:26:58.146 region:rollup2
THAT BECOMES A REAL CHALLENGE

01:26:55.711 --> 01:26:59.681 region:rollup2
BUT BUT I I'M I'M JUST I'M I'M

01:26:58.146 --> 01:27:01.450 region:rollup2
I'M ALWAYS IN ALL OF THE

01:26:59.681 --> 01:27:03.151 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL A PIECE BECAUSE AND

01:27:01.450 --> 01:27:05.120 region:rollup2
THOSE SYSTEMS THAT ARE THERE

01:27:03.151 --> 01:27:06.855 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY SEEM TO BE ALIVE

01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:08.490 region:rollup2
ONE HAND GIVEN TO THE EXPAND.

01:27:06.855 --> 01:27:09.524 region:rollup2
AND IT ENDS UP WITH A THIRD HAND

01:27:08.490 --> 01:27:10.125 region:rollup2
WHICH IS WHAT WE WANTED TO GO IN

01:27:09.524 --> 01:27:13.028 region:rollup2
FIRST PLACE.

01:27:10.125 --> 01:27:14.629 region:rollup2
AND ALL AND I'M JUST THINKING

01:27:13.028 --> 01:27:16.064 region:rollup2
WHY DID WE DO ALL THAT.

01:27:14.629 --> 01:27:17.332 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW JUST TO GIVE THE MONEY

01:27:16.064 --> 01:27:18.767 region:rollup2
BACK TO THE INSTITUTIONS IT JUST

01:27:17.332 --> 01:27:20.902 region:rollup2
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

01:27:18.767 --> 01:27:21.503 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW HOUSING THOSE KINDS OF

01:27:20.902 --> 01:27:24.306 region:rollup2
THINGS HERE THAT THAT'S THERE

01:27:21.503 --> 01:27:24.940 region:rollup2
BUT YOU KNOW IS SELLING EUROPE

01:27:24.306 --> 01:27:26.141 region:rollup2
WITH CERTAIN PEOPLE HAVE FREE

01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:27.275 region:rollup2
TUITION.

01:27:26.141 --> 01:27:28.744 region:rollup2
JUST DON'T CHARGING TUITION GIVE

01:27:27.275 --> 01:27:29.778 region:rollup2
MONEY TO THE INSTITUTIONS WHERE

01:27:28.744 --> 01:27:30.979 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GOING RATHER THAN GIVE

01:27:29.778 --> 01:27:32.180 region:rollup2
IT TO THEM SO THEY COULD PAY

01:27:30.979 --> 01:27:33.782 region:rollup2
THEIR DREAM ACT FUNNY OR

01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:34.449 region:rollup2
WHATEVER IT IS AND COME BACK

01:27:33.782 --> 01:27:34.950 region:rollup2
AROUND IN THE DIFFERENT KIND OF

01:27:34.449 --> 01:27:36.218 region:rollup2
WAY.

01:27:34.950 --> 01:27:37.619 region:rollup2
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE A TREMENDOUS

01:27:36.218 --> 01:27:38.887 region:rollup2
WASTE OF ENERGY BUT ALSO NOT

01:27:37.619 --> 01:27:40.122 region:rollup2
VERY CLEAR TO US.

01:27:38.887 --> 01:27:43.258 region:rollup2

--

01:28:24.499 --> 01:28:27.502 region:rollup2
I WAS ASKED TO PROVIDE A HIGH

01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:28.703 region:rollup2
LEVEL OVERVIEW OF FUNDING FOR

01:28:27.502 --> 01:28:30.338 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS IN

01:28:28.703 --> 01:28:31.606 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:28:30.338 --> 01:28:34.075 region:rollup2
I DO THINK IT I MIGHT HELP

01:28:31.606 --> 01:28:36.077 region:rollup2
ADDRESS SOME OF THE DISCUSSION

01:28:34.075 --> 01:28:37.746 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS THAT YOU JUST TIED SO

01:28:36.077 --> 01:28:38.880 region:rollup2
STARTING HERE ON PAGE.

01:28:37.746 --> 01:28:41.583 region:rollup2
ONE IT LOOKS OUT MAJOR

01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:43.051 region:rollup2
FINANCIALLY DEVELOPMENTS.

01:28:41.583 --> 01:28:44.553 region:rollup2
THE STATE FIRST PROVIDED

01:28:43.051 --> 01:28:46.321 region:rollup2
SUBSIDIES DIRECTLY TO THE

01:28:44.553 --> 01:28:48.323 region:rollup2
INSTITUTION INSTITUTIONS SO IT'S

01:28:46.321 --> 01:28:49.624 region:rollup2
DONE THIS FOR DECADES.

01:28:48.323 --> 01:28:51.092 region:rollup2
WHEN THE STATE PROVIDES FUNDING

01:28:49.624 --> 01:28:52.194 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY TO EACH OF THE

01:28:51.092 --> 01:28:54.095 region:rollup2
STATEMENTS THAT EFFECTIVELY

01:28:52.194 --> 01:28:55.297 region:rollup2
REDUCE THOSE TUITION FOR

01:28:54.095 --> 01:28:57.232 region:rollup2
EVERYONE AYE WHETHER THEY HAVE

01:28:55.297 --> 01:28:58.700 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL NEED DEMONSTRATED

01:28:57.232 --> 01:29:01.403 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL NEED?

01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:01.937 region:rollup2
SO WHEN YOU LOOK IN TWENTY

01:29:01.403 --> 01:29:03.438 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THE STATE

01:29:01.937 --> 01:29:04.639 region:rollup2
SUBSIDIES TO THE STATE TO THE

01:29:03.438 --> 01:29:06.908 region:rollup2
EACH OF THE SEGMENTS WAS

01:29:04.639 --> 01:29:10.745 region:rollup2
COVERING 95% OF THE EDUCATION

01:29:06.908 --> 01:29:14.583 region:rollup2
COSTS AT THE COLLEGES. 68% THAT

01:29:10.745 --> 01:29:16.451 region:rollup2
CS YOU AND 62% AT UC'S SO THE

01:29:14.583 --> 01:29:18.553 region:rollup2
STATE SUBSIDIES WERE COVERING UP

01:29:16.451 --> 01:29:21.223 region:rollup2
A PREPONDERANCE OF COST AT AT

01:29:18.553 --> 01:29:22.657 region:rollup2
SEVERAL OF THE SEGMENTS.

01:29:21.223 --> 01:29:24.559 region:rollup2
IN THE MID FIFTIES THE STATE

01:29:22.657 --> 01:29:26.561 region:rollup2
PROVIDED ITS FIRST TARGETED

01:29:24.559 --> 01:29:27.462 region:rollup2
FINANCIALLY PROGRAM SO RATHER

01:29:26.561 --> 01:29:29.297 region:rollup2
THAN GIVING MONEY TO THE

01:29:27.462 --> 01:29:31.032 region:rollup2
SEGMENTS THAT GAVE IT DIRECTLY

01:29:29.297 --> 01:29:32.367 region:rollup2
TO FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS.

01:29:31.032 --> 01:29:33.902 region:rollup2
THE VERY FIRST STATE FUNDED

01:29:32.367 --> 01:29:35.637 region:rollup2
PROGRAM FOCUSED ON TUITION

01:29:33.902 --> 01:29:37.739 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE THAT FOCUSED ON HIGH

01:29:35.637 --> 01:29:40.508 region:rollup2
COST INSTITUTIONS INCLUDING

01:29:37.739 --> 01:29:41.776 region:rollup2
PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES.

01:29:40.508 --> 01:29:43.745 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GOT

01:29:41.776 --> 01:29:44.913 region:rollup2
INVOLVED IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES

01:29:43.745 --> 01:29:46.848 region:rollup2
CREATING THEIR OWN GRANT AND

01:29:44.913 --> 01:29:48.116 region:rollup2
LOAN PROGRAMS AND THOSE PROGRAMS

01:29:46.848 --> 01:29:49.885 region:rollup2
CREATED IN THE SIXTIES ARE THE

01:29:48.116 --> 01:29:51.019 region:rollup2
PRECURSORS OF WHAT WE HAVE TODAY

01:29:49.885 --> 01:29:53.455 region:rollup2
SO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TODAY

01:29:51.019 --> 01:29:54.723 region:rollup2
HAS A LARGE PROGRAM PROGRAM.

01:29:53.455 --> 01:29:57.025 region:rollup2
AND ALSO HAS LARGE STUDENT LOAN

01:29:54.723 --> 01:29:58.593 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS.

01:29:57.025 --> 01:29:59.828 region:rollup2
IN THE LATE NINETEEN SEVENTIES

01:29:58.593 --> 01:30:01.563 region:rollup2
AT THAT POINT THE STATE HAD A

01:29:59.828 --> 01:30:03.298 region:rollup2
PATCHWORK OF STATE FUNDED

01:30:01.563 --> 01:30:04.499 region:rollup2
PROGRAM SO IT REPLACE THOSE

01:30:03.298 --> 01:30:05.767 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS WITH THE CAL GRANT

01:30:04.499 --> 01:30:07.035 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

01:30:05.767 --> 01:30:08.303 region:rollup2
AND THE STRUCTURE PUT IN PLACE

01:30:07.035 --> 01:30:09.638 region:rollup2
FOR THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM IS

01:30:08.303 --> 01:30:10.639 region:rollup2
LARGELY THE SAME AS IT DOES

01:30:09.638 --> 01:30:11.239 region:rollup2
TODAY.

01:30:10.639 --> 01:30:14.609 region:rollup2
SO BACK IN THE LATE SEVENTIES

01:30:11.239 --> 01:30:17.112 region:rollup2
THE STATE A PROGRAM THAT WOULD

01:30:14.609 --> 01:30:19.514 region:rollup2
PROVIDE TUITION ASSISTANCE FOR

01:30:17.112 --> 01:30:21.249 region:rollup2
SORT OF MIDDLE INCOME STUDENTS.

01:30:19.514 --> 01:30:23.018 region:rollup2
CAL GRANT BE WOULD PROVIDE BOTH

01:30:21.249 --> 01:30:24.519 region:rollup2
TUITION ASSISTANCE AND SOME

01:30:23.018 --> 01:30:25.854 region:rollup2
LIVING COVERAGE BUT IT WOULD DO

01:30:24.519 --> 01:30:26.655 region:rollup2
IT FOR THE FINANCIALLY NEEDY OUR

01:30:25.854 --> 01:30:28.523 region:rollup2
STUDENTS THE LOWER INCOME

01:30:26.655 --> 01:30:29.691 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

01:30:28.523 --> 01:30:31.259 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE CAL GRANT SEE WOULD

01:30:29.691 --> 01:30:32.927 region:rollup2
BE A SPECIALIZED PROGRAM THAT

01:30:31.259 --> 01:30:34.396 region:rollup2
WOULD HELP THOSE STUDENTS WHO

01:30:32.927 --> 01:30:38.133 region:rollup2
ARE GOING INTO SHORT TERM HER

01:30:34.396 --> 01:30:40.302 region:rollup2
TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS.

01:30:38.133 --> 01:30:41.836 region:rollup2
IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES CSU IN

01:30:40.302 --> 01:30:42.537 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES

01:30:41.836 --> 01:30:44.839 region:rollup2
INTRODUCED THEIR OWN

01:30:42.537 --> 01:30:46.241 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONAL AID PROGRAMS.

01:30:44.839 --> 01:30:48.109 region:rollup2
I WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:30:46.241 --> 01:30:49.811 region:rollup2
BUT AT THIS TIME INSTITUTIONAL

01:30:48.109 --> 01:30:52.047 region:rollup2
I'M EDUCATION FEES ARE BEING

01:30:49.811 --> 01:30:53.381 region:rollup2
INSTITUTED INSTITUTIONAL AID

01:30:52.047 --> 01:30:54.949 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT THE COLLEGE AT THE

01:30:53.381 --> 01:30:55.684 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATIVE ARE INTENDED TO

01:30:54.949 --> 01:30:58.253 region:rollup2
COVER.

01:30:55.684 --> 01:30:59.921 region:rollup2
THOSE ON EDUCATION FEES.

01:30:58.253 --> 01:31:01.323 region:rollup2
SO AT THIS POINT IN TIME OVER

01:30:59.921 --> 01:31:02.891 region:rollup2
TIME THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:31:01.323 --> 01:31:04.459 region:rollup2
PROGRAM TRADITIONALLY BECAME

01:31:02.891 --> 01:31:06.795 region:rollup2
KNOWN AS THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS

01:31:04.459 --> 01:31:08.296 region:rollup2
FEE WAIVER PROGRAM THE CS YOU'VE

01:31:06.795 --> 01:31:09.998 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONALLY PROGRAM BECAME

01:31:08.296 --> 01:31:11.1000 region:rollup2
KNOWN AS THE STATE UNIVERSITY

01:31:09.998 --> 01:31:12.701 region:rollup2
GRANT PROGRAM.

01:31:11.1000 --> 01:31:14.402 region:rollup2
YOU SEE HAD ALREADY HAD AN

01:31:12.701 --> 01:31:15.570 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONAL AID PROGRAM IN

01:31:14.402 --> 01:31:18.206 region:rollup2
PLACE THAN IT HAD COVERED

01:31:15.570 --> 01:31:20.008 region:rollup2
TUITION AS WELL AS LIVING COST

01:31:18.206 --> 01:31:20.508 region:rollup2
TRADITIONALLY THAT'S BEEN CALLED

01:31:20.008 --> 01:31:23.445 region:rollup2
THE UNIVERSITY STUDENT A

01:31:20.508 --> 01:31:24.079 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

01:31:23.445 --> 01:31:25.447 region:rollup2
SO YOU TURN TO PAGE TO IT JUST

01:31:24.079 --> 01:31:27.182 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHTS A FEW OTHER MAJOR

01:31:25.447 --> 01:31:27.983 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENTS OVER THE DECADE SO

01:31:27.182 --> 01:31:30.318 region:rollup2
THE STATE.

01:31:27.983 --> 01:31:31.519 region:rollup2
MADE PROGRAMS AN ENTITLEMENT IN

01:31:30.318 --> 01:31:33.088 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND AND ONE SO THOSE

01:31:31.519 --> 01:31:34.556 region:rollup2
STUDENTS PARTICULARLY WHO ARE

01:31:33.088 --> 01:31:35.190 region:rollup2
COMING STRAIGHT OUT OF HIGH

01:31:34.556 --> 01:31:37.192 region:rollup2
SCHOOL.

01:31:35.190 --> 01:31:38.393 region:rollup2
AND ARE WERE ONLY SPENDING A FEW

01:31:37.192 --> 01:31:40.028 region:rollup2
YEARS OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL BEFORE

01:31:38.393 --> 01:31:41.096 region:rollup2
GOING TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND

01:31:40.028 --> 01:31:42.964 region:rollup2
THEN WE'RE COMPLETING OUR

01:31:41.096 --> 01:31:44.466 region:rollup2
TRANSFER COLLEGE LOWER DIVISION

01:31:42.964 --> 01:31:46.434 region:rollup2
COURSES THAT COMMUNICATIVE IN

01:31:44.466 --> 01:31:47.702 region:rollup2
JUST A FEW YEARS TIME.

01:31:46.434 --> 01:31:48.503 region:rollup2
THOSE WHO ARE TO RETIREMENT THAT

01:31:47.702 --> 01:31:50.105 region:rollup2
FACT OF LEON AT PRETTY

01:31:48.503 --> 01:31:52.207 region:rollup2
STREAMLINED PATH TOWARD THE

01:31:50.105 --> 01:31:53.408 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY IS WOULD BE ENTITLED

01:31:52.207 --> 01:31:54.676 region:rollup2
FOR AID.

01:31:53.408 --> 01:31:56.311 region:rollup2
AND THEN THOSE STUDENTS WHO DO

01:31:54.676 --> 01:31:57.746 region:rollup2
NOT QUALIFY WOULD BECOME

01:31:56.311 --> 01:31:59.047 region:rollup2
ELIGIBLE FOR A COMPETITIVE

01:31:57.746 --> 01:32:00.482 region:rollup2
PROGRAM TYPICALLY THEY WOULDN'T

01:31:59.047 --> 01:32:02.150 region:rollup2
BE ELIGIBLE BECAUSE OF THEIR AGE

01:32:00.482 --> 01:32:02.684 region:rollup2
OR BECAUSE OF THE LENGTH OF TIME

01:32:02.150 --> 01:32:04.419 region:rollup2
THAT THEY HAD OUT OF HIGH

01:32:02.684 --> 01:32:05.553 region:rollup2
SCHOOL.

01:32:04.419 --> 01:32:07.589 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE STATEMENT SOME

01:32:05.553 --> 01:32:08.490 region:rollup2
REFINEMENTS AND TWO THOUSAND AND

01:32:07.589 --> 01:32:10.225 region:rollup2
ONE TO THAT PROGRAM SEE PROGRAM

01:32:08.490 --> 01:32:12.127 region:rollup2
JUST REFINING AT TRYING TO

01:32:10.225 --> 01:32:13.228 region:rollup2
TARGET TO DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS

01:32:12.127 --> 01:32:15.430 region:rollup2
TO CERTAIN HIGH WORKFORCE DEMAND

01:32:13.228 --> 01:32:18.166 region:rollup2
AREAS.

01:32:15.430 --> 01:32:18.800 region:rollup2
FROM TWO THOUSAND ONE THROUGH

01:32:18.166 --> 01:32:20.435 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THE STATE

01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:21.870 region:rollup2
TOOK OF WRITER OPTIONS TO GIVE

01:32:20.435 --> 01:32:24.205 region:rollup2
SOME AID OPPORTUNITIES TO

01:32:21.870 --> 01:32:25.540 region:rollup2
UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS SO OVER

01:32:24.205 --> 01:32:27.008 region:rollup2
THAT COURSE OF TIME IT PROVIDE

01:32:25.540 --> 01:32:29.043 region:rollup2
IT ALLOWS YOU STUDENTS TO

01:32:27.008 --> 01:32:31.312 region:rollup2
QUALIFY FOR RESIDENT TUITION

01:32:29.043 --> 01:32:32.881 region:rollup2
CHARGES I EACH OF THE SEGMENTS.

01:32:31.312 --> 01:32:34.816 region:rollup2
THEN AND ALLOW THEM TO QUALIFY

01:32:32.881 --> 01:32:35.784 region:rollup2
FOR STATE FUNDED AID AND THEN

01:32:34.816 --> 01:32:38.987 region:rollup2
AND ALLOW THEM TO GET STATE

01:32:35.784 --> 01:32:40.188 region:rollup2
FUNDED LOANS.

01:32:38.987 --> 01:32:42.056 region:rollup2
DURING THE RECESSION YOU'VE

01:32:40.188 --> 01:32:43.892 region:rollup2
HEARD A LOT ABOUT STATE FUNDING

01:32:42.056 --> 01:32:46.461 region:rollup2
DROPPING INTUITION CHARGES

01:32:43.892 --> 01:32:47.595 region:rollup2
INCREASING AND AT THIS TIME

01:32:46.461 --> 01:32:48.730 region:rollup2
THERE WAS INCREASING CONCERN

01:32:47.595 --> 01:32:50.899 region:rollup2
WITH MODELING.

01:32:48.730 --> 01:32:51.866 region:rollup2
INCOME STUDENTS EVEN THOSE WHO

01:32:50.899 --> 01:32:54.469 region:rollup2
ONE AND HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN

01:32:51.866 --> 01:32:57.305 region:rollup2
DEFINED AS FINANCIALLY NEEDY AND

01:32:54.469 --> 01:32:57.906 region:rollup2
SO AT THIS POINT IN TIME TWO

01:32:57.305 --> 01:32:58.540 region:rollup2
THOUSAND THIRTEEN FOURTEEN THE

01:32:57.906 --> 01:33:00.108 region:rollup2
STATE PUTS IN PLACE THE MIDDLE

01:32:58.540 --> 01:33:01.476 region:rollup2
CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM.

01:33:00.108 --> 01:33:04.245 region:rollup2
TODAY THAT PROGRAMS FULLY

01:33:01.476 --> 01:33:05.847 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED IT COVERS 40% OF THE

01:33:04.245 --> 01:33:07.549 region:rollup2
TUITION CHARGE FOR MIDDLE INCOME

01:33:05.847 --> 01:33:09.818 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WHO DON'T QUALIFY FOR

01:33:07.549 --> 01:33:11.386 region:rollup2
THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM.

01:33:09.818 --> 01:33:12.787 region:rollup2
AND THEN EVEN MORE RECENTLY THE

01:33:11.386 --> 01:33:14.456 region:rollup2
NOT JUST THE LAST FEW BUDGET

01:33:12.787 --> 01:33:15.924 region:rollup2
CYCLES THE STATE HAS CREATED

01:33:14.456 --> 01:33:17.692 region:rollup2
SOME PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE LIVING

01:33:15.924 --> 01:33:19.461 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:33:17.692 --> 01:33:20.995 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WHO DO QUALIFY FOR THE

01:33:19.461 --> 01:33:22.530 region:rollup2
CAL GRANT BE PROGRAM.

01:33:20.995 --> 01:33:24.732 region:rollup2
BUT WHO QUALIFY TYPICALLY FOR A

01:33:22.530 --> 01:33:26.000 region:rollup2
RATHER MODEST LIVING ADJUSTMENT

01:33:24.732 --> 01:33:27.936 region:rollup2
THIS IS TO PROVIDE THEM A MORE

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:29.270 region:rollup2
GENEROUS LIVING GRANT IF THEY GO

01:33:27.936 --> 01:33:30.905 region:rollup2
FULL TIME.

01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:32.106 region:rollup2
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THEY TAKE

01:33:30.905 --> 01:33:33.641 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN OR MORE UNITS TODAY THEY

01:33:32.106 --> 01:33:35.410 region:rollup2
QUALIFY FOR FOUR THOUSAND

01:33:33.641 --> 01:33:37.412 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IN GRANT FUNDS ABOVE THE

01:33:35.410 --> 01:33:38.880 region:rollup2
CAL GRANT BE ACCESSED THE WORD

01:33:37.412 --> 01:33:41.483 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE PROGRAM TO FADE OUT

01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:43.218 region:rollup2
APPLY FOR IT.

01:33:41.483 --> 01:33:44.953 region:rollup2
PAGE THREE AND FOUR THEN FOCUS

01:33:43.218 --> 01:33:46.855 region:rollup2
ON MORE DEEPLY WHAT'S HAPPENED

01:33:44.953 --> 01:33:48.189 region:rollup2
TO TUITION AND FINANCIAL AID

01:33:46.855 --> 01:33:50.425 region:rollup2
OVER THE YEARS.

01:33:48.189 --> 01:33:52.393 region:rollup2
SO IN THE EARLY NINETEEN

01:33:50.425 --> 01:33:54.028 region:rollup2
HUNDREDS GOING WAY BACK YOU SEE

01:33:52.393 --> 01:33:55.797 region:rollup2
HAD THINGS CALLED FEES IT WASN'T

01:33:54.028 --> 01:33:57.732 region:rollup2
UNTIL THE NINETEEN SEVENTY IS

01:33:55.797 --> 01:33:59.601 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY CREATED AN EDUCATION

01:33:57.732 --> 01:34:01.369 region:rollup2
FEET UP OVER THE DECADES OF

01:33:59.601 --> 01:34:02.937 region:rollup2
VAULT INTO THE TUITION CHART WE

01:34:01.369 --> 01:34:04.672 region:rollup2
KNOW OF TODAY.

01:34:02.937 --> 01:34:07.208 region:rollup2
CSU ALSO HAD HISTORY OF COURSE

01:34:04.672 --> 01:34:09.144 region:rollup2
FEES MATERIAL IN SERVICE FEES

01:34:07.208 --> 01:34:11.913 region:rollup2
BUT THEY DON'T CREATE THE THOSE

01:34:09.144 --> 01:34:12.514 region:rollup2
STATE UNIVERSITY FEE UNTIL

01:34:11.913 --> 01:34:13.882 region:rollup2
NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE EIGHTY TWO

01:34:12.514 --> 01:34:15.683 region:rollup2
THE SAUCER HAS EVOLVED OVER TIME

01:34:13.882 --> 01:34:16.484 region:rollup2
TO BECOME THE TUITION FEE.

01:34:15.683 --> 01:34:19.487 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE CREATED ITS M.

01:34:16.484 --> 01:34:20.088 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT FEE AND NINETEEN

01:34:19.487 --> 01:34:23.558 region:rollup2
EIGHTY FOUR AND ALL OF THESE

01:34:20.088 --> 01:34:24.626 region:rollup2
CASES THAT EDUCATION FEE HAS

01:34:23.558 --> 01:34:26.628 region:rollup2
EBBED AND FLOWED WITH THE

01:34:24.626 --> 01:34:28.163 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC CYCLE INCREASING AS

01:34:26.628 --> 01:34:29.330 region:rollup2
YOU'VE HEARD LOTS ABOUT DURING

01:34:28.163 --> 01:34:30.732 region:rollup2
RECESSIONS.

01:34:29.330 --> 01:34:32.367 region:rollup2
THIS IS TIMES WHEN THE STATE

01:34:30.732 --> 01:34:34.235 region:rollup2
FUNDS FUNDING US DROPPING IT'S

01:34:32.367 --> 01:34:35.637 region:rollup2
ALSO THE TIME WHERE FAMILY WAGES

01:34:34.235 --> 01:34:36.905 region:rollup2
TEND TO BE STAGNATING AND

01:34:35.637 --> 01:34:38.673 region:rollup2
UNEMPLOYMENT TIMES TO BE

01:34:36.905 --> 01:34:40.542 region:rollup2
INCREASING.

01:34:38.673 --> 01:34:42.410 region:rollup2
JUSTIN CONTRAST DURING

01:34:40.542 --> 01:34:43.711 region:rollup2
RECOVERIES STATE FUNDING IS

01:34:42.410 --> 01:34:45.480 region:rollup2
INCREASING SO FEES ARE A HALT

01:34:43.711 --> 01:34:46.781 region:rollup2
FLAT THIS IS ALSO THE TIME WHEN

01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:47.282 region:rollup2
FAMILY INCOMES TEND TO BE

01:34:46.781 --> 01:34:49.918 region:rollup2
INCREASING UNEMPLOYMENT

01:34:47.282 --> 01:34:51.186 region:rollup2
DROPPING.

01:34:49.918 --> 01:34:52.186 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU LOOKED AT THE PERIOD

01:34:51.186 --> 01:34:53.888 region:rollup2
THE TWENTY FIVE YEAR PERIOD

01:34:52.186 --> 01:34:55.490 region:rollup2
STRETCHING FROM NINETEEN NINETY

01:34:53.888 --> 01:34:57.325 region:rollup2
THROUGH TWENTY FIFTEEN AND

01:34:55.490 --> 01:34:59.194 region:rollup2
INFLATION ADJUSTED DOLLARS YOU

01:34:57.325 --> 01:35:00.662 region:rollup2
SEE THAT THE FEE AT UC NC ISSUES

01:34:59.194 --> 01:35:03.198 region:rollup2
INCREASE FIFTEEN TIMES?

01:35:00.662 --> 01:35:05.300 region:rollup2
AND AT THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGES

01:35:03.198 --> 01:35:07.368 region:rollup2
THIRTY FOLD SERVE OBVIOUSLY VERY

01:35:05.300 --> 01:35:09.003 region:rollup2
STEEP INCREASE AS DESPITE THOSE

01:35:07.368 --> 01:35:10.705 region:rollup2
INCREASES COMMUNITY COLLEGE FEES

01:35:09.003 --> 01:35:11.673 region:rollup2
TODAY ARE STILL THE LOWEST IN

01:35:10.705 --> 01:35:14.175 region:rollup2
THE NATION.

01:35:11.673 --> 01:35:15.743 region:rollup2
AS CSU IS LOW RELATIVE TO ITS

01:35:14.175 --> 01:35:17.145 region:rollup2
AND INSTITUTIONS ACROSS THE

01:35:15.743 --> 01:35:18.746 region:rollup2
COUNTRY.

01:35:17.145 --> 01:35:20.114 region:rollup2
BY CONTRAST UC'S TUITION CHARGES

01:35:18.746 --> 01:35:21.282 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN ITS

01:35:20.114 --> 01:35:23.685 region:rollup2
COMPARABLE INSTITUTIONS ACROSS

01:35:21.282 --> 01:35:24.752 region:rollup2
THE COUNTRY.

01:35:23.685 --> 01:35:26.154 region:rollup2
HAVE YOU TURN TO PAGE FOUR IT

01:35:24.752 --> 01:35:28.156 region:rollup2
GIVES YOU COMPARABLE INFORMATION

01:35:26.154 --> 01:35:30.024 region:rollup2
ON AND FINANCIAL AID FOR

01:35:28.156 --> 01:35:32.093 region:rollup2
UNDERGRADUATES FOR STUDENTS IN

01:35:30.024 --> 01:35:33.761 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:35:32.093 --> 01:35:35.997 region:rollup2
I TUITION I I'M SORRY SPENDING

01:35:33.761 --> 01:35:37.365 region:rollup2
ON CAL GRANTS GOES UP AS TUITION

01:35:35.997 --> 01:35:39.334 region:rollup2
INCREASES TO YOU CAN SEE THOSE

01:35:37.365 --> 01:35:40.435 region:rollup2
TRENDS.

01:35:39.334 --> 01:35:42.403 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SEE IN INFLATION

01:35:40.435 --> 01:35:43.905 region:rollup2
ADJUSTED TERMS FINANCIAL AID

01:35:42.403 --> 01:35:46.474 region:rollup2
SPENDINGS INCREASED FIVE FOLD

01:35:43.905 --> 01:35:47.542 region:rollup2
OVER THE PERIOD SO BY TWENTY

01:35:46.474 --> 01:35:49.210 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN MORE THAN EIGHT BILLION

01:35:47.542 --> 01:35:53.314 region:rollup2
A SPENT ANNUALLY ON AID.

01:35:49.210 --> 01:35:54.882 region:rollup2
FOR UNDERGRADUATES.

01:35:53.314 --> 01:35:56.084 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH THE NEXT PAGE GETS OUT

01:35:54.882 --> 01:35:56.985 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE CONVERSATION YOU

01:35:56.084 --> 01:35:59.220 region:rollup2
WERE HAVING EARLIER WITHIN THAT

01:35:56.985 --> 01:36:01.889 region:rollup2
PRICE.

01:35:59.220 --> 01:36:03.391 region:rollup2
AND SO FINANCIAL AID APPEARS TO

01:36:01.889 --> 01:36:05.093 region:rollup2
BE WORKING GENERALLY AS AN TIME

01:36:03.391 --> 01:36:07.362 region:rollup2
DEAD WHERE LOWER INCOME STUDENTS

01:36:05.093 --> 01:36:08.963 region:rollup2
ARE FACING LOWER NET PRICE.

01:36:07.362 --> 01:36:10.698 region:rollup2
SO WHAT NOT PRICES A MEASURE OF

01:36:08.963 --> 01:36:12.100 region:rollup2
HIS LOOKING NOT FROM A STUDENT'S

01:36:10.698 --> 01:36:13.101 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE THERE COST OF

01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:14.902 region:rollup2
ATTENDANCE SO NOT FROM THE

01:36:13.101 --> 01:36:16.638 region:rollup2
STATE'S PERSPECTIVE BUT FROM THE

01:36:14.902 --> 01:36:19.040 region:rollup2
STUDENT'S TUITION LEVINE HOW

01:36:16.638 --> 01:36:19.841 region:rollup2
MUCH DOES IT COST IS IT UP TO

01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:21.509 region:rollup2
THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS.

01:36:19.841 --> 01:36:24.545 region:rollup2
IT'S ABSTRACTS ALL OF THEIR GIFT

01:36:21.509 --> 01:36:25.146 region:rollup2
DATED AND LOOKS AT HOW MUCH THEN

01:36:24.545 --> 01:36:26.981 region:rollup2
IS THE PRICE THAT THEY HAVE TO

01:36:25.146 --> 01:36:29.217 region:rollup2
PAY.

01:36:26.981 --> 01:36:30.652 region:rollup2
AND I'M THE GRAPHIC AT THE TOP

01:36:29.217 --> 01:36:31.953 region:rollup2
SHOWS YOU JUST THE INCOME

01:36:30.652 --> 01:36:33.755 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTION ACROSS STATES OF

01:36:31.953 --> 01:36:35.390 region:rollup2
THE CAMPUSES SO YOU CAN SEE THAT

01:36:33.755 --> 01:36:37.125 region:rollup2
STUDENTS THAT THE COLLEGES.

01:36:35.390 --> 01:36:39.160 region:rollup2
ARE LOWER INCOME THAN NOT THE

01:36:37.125 --> 01:36:40.528 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY IS 67% OF

01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:41.763 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATIVE STUDENTS FOR

01:36:40.528 --> 01:36:42.830 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE COME FROM FAMILIES

01:36:41.763 --> 01:36:45.099 region:rollup2
EARNING LESS THAN THIRTY

01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:46.834 region:rollup2
THOUSAND A YEAR. FOR THOSE

01:36:45.099 --> 01:36:49.003 region:rollup2
STUDENTS I'M AND NOT INCOME

01:36:46.834 --> 01:36:51.139 region:rollup2
RANGE AT THE COLLEGES THEIR PAIN

01:36:49.003 --> 01:36:52.306 region:rollup2
I'M EITHER OUT OF POCKET OR

01:36:51.139 --> 01:36:55.009 region:rollup2
THROUGH SOME SORT OF BORROWING

01:36:52.306 --> 01:36:55.610 region:rollup2
OR WORK EARNINGS FIVE THOUSAND

01:36:55.009 --> 01:36:56.811 region:rollup2
SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE

01:36:55.610 --> 01:36:58.112 region:rollup2
DOLLARS THESE ARE FIFTEEN

01:36:56.811 --> 01:36:59.580 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN NUMBERS.

01:36:58.112 --> 01:37:01.215 region:rollup2
BUT YOU CAN SEE ACROSS ALL OF

01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:02.884 region:rollup2
THE SEGMENTS THAT AS FAMILY

01:37:01.215 --> 01:37:04.485 region:rollup2
INCOME GOES UP THAT NIGHT PRICE

01:37:02.884 --> 01:37:05.987 region:rollup2
GOES THAT THIS IS WHAT YOU

01:37:04.485 --> 01:37:07.522 region:rollup2
PRESUMABLY WOULD WANT TO SEE

01:37:05.987 --> 01:37:09.257 region:rollup2
THAT AS FAMILIES.

01:37:07.522 --> 01:37:10.425 region:rollup2
INCOMES IMPROVE --

01:37:09.257 --> 01:37:11.893 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNT THAT THEY PAY OUT OF

01:37:10.425 --> 01:37:13.061 region:rollup2
POCKET INCREASES BUT THAT THE

01:37:11.893 --> 01:37:14.796 region:rollup2
FINANCIALLY NEEDY OF STUDENTS

01:37:13.061 --> 01:37:16.664 region:rollup2
ARE PAINT THE LEAST THIS IS A

01:37:14.796 --> 01:37:18.566 region:rollup2
TREND YOU TO SEE AGAIN ACROSS

01:37:16.664 --> 01:37:20.568 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE SEGMENTS.

01:37:18.566 --> 01:37:22.103 region:rollup2
THE REASON NOT NOT PRICE IS AS

01:37:20.568 --> 01:37:23.805 region:rollup2
LOW AS THAT IS IN CALIFORNIA IS

01:37:22.103 --> 01:37:25.573 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF STAMPS SUBSTANTIAL

01:37:23.805 --> 01:37:28.676 region:rollup2
SHARE OF UNDERGRADUATES TO GET

01:37:25.573 --> 01:37:30.011 region:rollup2
THEIR FEES COVERED SO 58% OF

01:37:28.676 --> 01:37:32.146 region:rollup2
UNDERGRADUATES AT THE COMMUNITY

01:37:30.011 --> 01:37:35.850 region:rollup2
COLLEGES ALMOST TWO THREE TWO

01:37:32.146 --> 01:37:37.285 region:rollup2
THIRDS OF THE UNIVERSITIES.

01:37:35.850 --> 01:37:39.253 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS THE CONVERSATION

01:37:37.285 --> 01:37:41.723 region:rollup2
AGAIN --

01:37:39.253 --> 01:37:44.058 region:rollup2
JUST SEN MAY BE A ADDRESS ONE OF

01:37:41.723 --> 01:37:45.093 region:rollup2
THE ISSUES ITEM IF YOU WERE IF

01:37:44.058 --> 01:37:46.761 region:rollup2
TO FOR EXAMPLE THINK ABOUT YOU

01:37:45.093 --> 01:37:48.663 region:rollup2
SEE IN RIGHT NOW THEY'RE CHARGED

01:37:46.761 --> 01:37:50.031 region:rollup2
AT TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS SO IF

01:37:48.663 --> 01:37:52.800 region:rollup2
YOU WERE TO SAY HEY LET'S CUT IT

01:37:50.031 --> 01:37:54.402 region:rollup2
IN HALF TO SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS.

01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:56.471 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE THERE OBVIOUSLY AS

01:37:54.402 --> 01:37:57.372 region:rollup2
YOUR NOW CHARGING EVERYBODY SIX

01:37:56.471 --> 01:37:59.006 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS SOME WHO MIGHT

01:37:57.372 --> 01:38:00.108 region:rollup2
NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT SO THAT

01:37:59.006 --> 01:38:00.875 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE THE THING THAT

01:38:00.108 --> 01:38:01.642 region:rollup2
PROHIBITS THEM FROM GOING TO

01:38:00.875 --> 01:38:02.877 region:rollup2
COLLEGE.

01:38:01.642 --> 01:38:04.712 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE FAMILIES WHO WOULD

01:38:02.877 --> 01:38:06.381 region:rollup2
GO TO COLLEGE REGARDLESS MIGHT

01:38:04.712 --> 01:38:08.583 region:rollup2
EVEN BE WILLING TO PAY TWICE AS

01:38:06.381 --> 01:38:10.151 region:rollup2
MUCH AS WE NOW CHARGE THEM THAT

01:38:08.583 --> 01:38:11.719 region:rollup2
MONEY WOULD EFFECTIVELY BE TAKEN

01:38:10.151 --> 01:38:13.087 region:rollup2
ON THE SYSTEM.

01:38:11.719 --> 01:38:14.655 region:rollup2
BUT IF YOU TURN TO THE LAST PAGE

01:38:13.087 --> 01:38:16.124 region:rollup2
CHAIR IS JUST ISSUES THAT ARE

01:38:14.655 --> 01:38:17.458 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE

01:38:16.124 --> 01:38:19.227 region:rollup2
SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT

01:38:17.458 --> 01:38:21.596 region:rollup2
FOR DECADES SOME OF THEM ARE

01:38:19.227 --> 01:38:22.663 region:rollup2
EMERGING SALIENT ISSUES.

01:38:21.596 --> 01:38:23.664 region:rollup2
THAT KEY AT ONE OF THE KEY

01:38:22.663 --> 01:38:25.299 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT YOU'VE TALKED A LOT

01:38:23.664 --> 01:38:26.134 region:rollup2
ABOUT ALREADY HAS JUST HOW MUCH

01:38:25.299 --> 01:38:27.668 region:rollup2
TO PUT DIRECTLY INTO THE

01:38:26.134 --> 01:38:29.103 region:rollup2
SEGMENTS VERSUS HOW MUCH TO

01:38:27.668 --> 01:38:30.805 region:rollup2
TARGET TO FINANCIALLY NEEDY

01:38:29.103 --> 01:38:32.440 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

01:38:30.805 --> 01:38:33.674 region:rollup2
ANOTHER PERENNIAL ISSUE IS ONCE

01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:35.576 region:rollup2
YOU'VE DETERMINED YOUR POT OF

01:38:33.674 --> 01:38:37.645 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL AID FUNDING HOW DO YOU

01:38:35.576 --> 01:38:39.080 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZE NOT AMONG FINANCIALLY

01:38:37.645 --> 01:38:41.015 region:rollup2
NEEDY STUDENTS LAST HOW MUCH

01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:43.017 region:rollup2
ATTENTION DO YOU DEDICATE SET A

01:38:41.015 --> 01:38:45.286 region:rollup2
TIME OUT OF COLLEGE INCOME AND

01:38:43.017 --> 01:38:46.754 region:rollup2
ASSETS ACADEMIC CRITERIA.

01:38:45.286 --> 01:38:48.623 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR ABOUT SOME

01:38:46.754 --> 01:38:50.525 region:rollup2
SUGGESTIONS FOR CHANGING SOME OF

01:38:48.623 --> 01:38:52.093 region:rollup2
THOSE CRITERIA IN AN EFFORT TO

01:38:50.525 --> 01:38:53.895 region:rollup2
SIMPLIFY AND MAKE IT EASIER FOR

01:38:52.093 --> 01:38:54.929 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

01:38:53.895 --> 01:38:56.664 region:rollup2
YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT THAT LATER ON

01:38:54.929 --> 01:38:58.232 region:rollup2
THE PANEL TODAY.

01:38:56.664 --> 01:39:00.802 region:rollup2
THE THIRD ISSUE WHICH IS

01:38:58.232 --> 01:39:04.939 region:rollup2
INCREASING LEAD A HIGH PROFILE

01:39:00.802 --> 01:39:04.939 region:rollup2
HAS TO DO WITH HOW TO PROVIDE

01:39:05.006 --> 01:39:08.109 region:rollup2
SO THE STATE HAS A TRADITION OF

01:39:06.808 --> 01:39:10.211 region:rollup2
PROVIDING SOME LIVING AID FOR

01:39:08.109 --> 01:39:11.946 region:rollup2
THE LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS BUT

01:39:10.211 --> 01:39:13.247 region:rollup2
MORE RECENTLY AS TRYING TO

01:39:11.946 --> 01:39:14.715 region:rollup2
EXPAND THE AMOUNT OF LIVING

01:39:13.247 --> 01:39:16.117 region:rollup2
COVERAGE THAT IT PROVIDES.

01:39:14.715 --> 01:39:17.919 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S A LOT OF ISSUES ARE

01:39:16.117 --> 01:39:19.320 region:rollup2
EMERGING AS IT CONSIDERS THAT'S

01:39:17.919 --> 01:39:21.522 region:rollup2
HOW MANY YEARS IS IT OKAY IF A

01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:22.523 region:rollup2
STUDENT IS IN COLLEGE FIVE SIX

01:39:21.522 --> 01:39:24.125 region:rollup2
SEVEN YEARS WITH THE STATE STILL

01:39:22.523 --> 01:39:25.626 region:rollup2
COVER LIVING COSTS.

01:39:24.125 --> 01:39:27.061 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD BE THE EXPECTATIONS

01:39:25.626 --> 01:39:28.396 region:rollup2
ON STUDENTS WORKER IN IN SOME

01:39:27.061 --> 01:39:29.764 region:rollup2
RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT STUDENTS

01:39:28.396 --> 01:39:31.399 region:rollup2
CAN WORK UP TO TWENTY HOURS

01:39:29.764 --> 01:39:32.733 region:rollup2
WITHOUT NEGATIVE OUTCOMES ON

01:39:31.399 --> 01:39:34.268 region:rollup2
THEIR EDUCATION WHAT THE STATE

01:39:32.733 --> 01:39:35.903 region:rollup2
EXPECT THEM TO WORK A MINIMUM

01:39:34.268 --> 01:39:37.371 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF HOURS?

01:39:35.903 --> 01:39:39.140 region:rollup2
SOME RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT AS

01:39:37.371 --> 01:39:40.608 region:rollup2
LONG AS STUDENTS GRADUATE THEY

01:39:39.140 --> 01:39:42.443 region:rollup2
TEND TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE THEIR

01:39:40.608 --> 01:39:44.111 region:rollup2
THAT LEVELS THE PROBLEM BECOMES

01:39:42.443 --> 01:39:45.446 region:rollup2
WHEN STUDENTS GET THREE YEARS

01:39:44.111 --> 01:39:47.215 region:rollup2
INTO A PROGRAM AND THEN DON'T

01:39:45.446 --> 01:39:48.950 region:rollup2
COMPLETE AND DON'T HAVE EASY

01:39:47.215 --> 01:39:50.318 region:rollup2
ACCESS. TO MANAGE THEIR DOT OVER

01:39:48.950 --> 01:39:51.519 region:rollup2
TIME.

01:39:50.318 --> 01:39:53.588 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALSO BEEN SOME

01:39:51.519 --> 01:39:55.056 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT KINDS

01:39:53.588 --> 01:39:56.691 region:rollup2
OF LIVING COSTS SHOULD THERE BE

01:39:55.056 --> 01:39:58.593 region:rollup2
EXPECTATIONS THAT STUDENTS THAT

01:39:56.691 --> 01:39:59.961 region:rollup2
COME LIVE AT HOME DO SO FOR A

01:39:58.593 --> 01:40:01.028 region:rollup2
YEAR OR THAT STUDENTS PICK

01:39:59.961 --> 01:40:02.530 region:rollup2
RELATIVELY AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:40:01.028 --> 01:40:04.432 region:rollup2
OPTIONS.

01:40:02.530 --> 01:40:05.800 region:rollup2
MANY ISSUES HAVE BEEN A MERGING

01:40:04.432 --> 01:40:06.868 region:rollup2
AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:08.836 region:rollup2
COVER LIVING COSTS IN AN

01:40:06.868 --> 01:40:09.704 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE WAY.

01:40:08.836 --> 01:40:11.839 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR

01:40:09.704 --> 01:40:13.274 region:rollup2
MUCH MORE ABOUT HOW COMPLEX THE

01:40:11.839 --> 01:40:14.308 region:rollup2
SYSTEM HAS GOTTEN FROM YOUR

01:40:13.274 --> 01:40:15.610 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE FROM STUDENTS

01:40:14.308 --> 01:40:17.845 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVES.

01:40:15.610 --> 01:40:19.380 region:rollup2
SO TRYING TO SIMPLIFY THE SYSTEM

01:40:17.845 --> 01:40:21.148 region:rollup2
WHILE STILL TAKING INDIVIDUAL

01:40:19.380 --> 01:40:22.450 region:rollup2
STUDENT NEEDS INTO ACCOUNT SO

01:40:21.148 --> 01:40:24.585 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE YOUR OPTIONS TO HAVE A

01:40:22.450 --> 01:40:25.853 region:rollup2
RESPONSIVE SYSTEM THAT STILL

01:40:24.585 --> 01:40:26.621 region:rollup2
MUCH EASIER TO UNDERSTAND I

01:40:25.853 --> 01:40:28.489 region:rollup2
THINK YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR ABOUT

01:40:26.621 --> 01:40:29.524 region:rollup2
SOME VERY REASONABLE OPTIONS.

01:40:28.489 --> 01:40:32.293 region:rollup2
THAT YOU MIGHT CONSIDER LATER ON

01:40:29.524 --> 01:40:34.462 region:rollup2
THE PANEL.

01:40:32.293 --> 01:40:35.296 region:rollup2
THANK YOU VERY MUCH PLEASE.

01:40:34.462 --> 01:40:36.297 region:rollup2
THANK AFTERNOON LOOKING BACK

01:40:35.296 --> 01:40:37.665 region:rollup2
THAT'S LIKE ALLOW BEHALF THE

FOR INVITING ME TO THIS OP PANEL

01:40:44.171 --> 01:40:45.439 region:rollup2
IN THIS HEARING --

01:40:44.605 --> 01:40:49.343 region:rollup2
FIRST BALL I INCREDIBLY

01:40:45.439 --> 01:40:49.911 region:rollup2

DOLLARS AND STATE FINANCIAL AID

01:40:52.747 --> 01:40:55.650 region:rollup2
--

01:40:54.148 --> 01:40:57.785 region:rollup2
AND TODAY BECAUSE JENNIFER HAVE

01:40:55.650 --> 01:40:59.420 region:rollup2
GONE OVER SOME OF THE CURRENT

01:40:57.785 --> 01:41:01.556 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS IN A WAY THE SHOULDN'T

01:40:59.420 --> 01:41:02.857 region:rollup2
NAME THEM WHICH IS FINE --

01:41:01.556 --> 01:41:04.559 region:rollup2
BUT WORK I'M GONNA TALK A LITTLE

01:41:02.857 --> 01:41:06.193 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE SHORTCOMINGS AND THEN

01:41:04.559 --> 01:41:07.295 region:rollup2
WHAT WE ENVISIONED SO I'VE CUT.

01:41:06.193 --> 01:41:08.763 region:rollup2
I CAN'T AT LEAST MY TESTIMONY AT

01:41:07.295 --> 01:41:10.565 region:rollup2
LEAST BY ONE THIRD OR SO WAS I

01:41:08.763 --> 01:41:13.367 region:rollup2
HOPE THAT'S HELPFUL --

01:41:10.565 --> 01:41:14.835 region:rollup2
VERSO WE HAVE A VERY GENEROUS --

01:41:13.367 --> 01:41:17.104 region:rollup2
FINANCIALLY THAT --

01:41:14.835 --> 01:41:18.739 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IN IT PROGRAM WHICH TWO

01:41:17.104 --> 01:41:20.708 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS THAT PROVIDES A

01:41:18.739 --> 01:41:21.375 region:rollup2
AWARDS TO ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED

01:41:20.708 --> 01:41:22.009 region:rollup2
THOUSAND STUDENTS AND OF COURSE

01:41:21.375 --> 01:41:24.245 region:rollup2
THE DEMOGRAPHIC OF THE STUDENT

01:41:22.009 --> 01:41:25.012 region:rollup2
HAS CHANGED OUR LAST FIFTEEN TO

01:41:24.245 --> 01:41:26.747 region:rollup2
TWENTY YEARS SO WE HAVE.

01:41:25.012 --> 01:41:29.583 region:rollup2
ALLOT MORE STUDENTS THAT ARE

01:41:26.747 --> 01:41:32.353 region:rollup2
FIRST GENERATION LOW INCOME --

01:41:29.583 --> 01:41:33.921 region:rollup2
THAT ALSO ARE --

01:41:32.353 --> 01:41:35.423 region:rollup2
OUR STUDENTS OF COLOR OF COURSE

01:41:33.921 --> 01:41:36.557 region:rollup2
AND WE ARE ENCOURAGING ALL

01:41:35.423 --> 01:41:38.526 region:rollup2
STUDENTS TO GO ON TO POST

01:41:36.557 --> 01:41:40.094 region:rollup2
SECONDARY EDUCATION SO THAT THE

01:41:38.526 --> 01:41:42.063 region:rollup2
STUDENT TODAY LOOKS DIFFERENT

01:41:40.094 --> 01:41:43.197 region:rollup2
WORKS MORE AND IT MIGHT EVEN BE

01:41:42.063 --> 01:41:44.065 region:rollup2
OLDER AND AND MARK

01:41:43.197 --> 01:41:45.166 region:rollup2
NONTRADITIONAL.

01:41:44.065 --> 01:41:46.667 region:rollup2
WE ALSO --

01:41:45.166 --> 01:41:48.736 region:rollup2
HAVE THE PRESTIGE OF OFFERING

01:41:46.667 --> 01:41:51.172 region:rollup2
CHOICES TO STUDENTS SO THEY CAN

01:41:48.736 --> 01:41:52.606 region:rollup2
ATTEND THE UC AND CSU COMMUNITY

01:41:51.172 --> 01:41:54.308 region:rollup2
COLLEGE AND THEY MEAN IT ATTEND

01:41:52.606 --> 01:41:56.210 region:rollup2
A PRIVATE FOR PROFIT OR

01:41:54.308 --> 01:41:57.611 region:rollup2
NONPROFIT A WASP ACCREDITED --

01:41:56.210 --> 01:42:00.014 region:rollup2
AND SO STUDENTS HAVE THAT CHOICE

01:41:57.611 --> 01:42:00.982 region:rollup2
WHICH IS UNIQUE AS WELL --

01:42:00.014 --> 01:42:03.551 region:rollup2
IN OUR STATE.

01:42:00.982 --> 01:42:06.153 region:rollup2
BUT SOME OF THE SOME OF THE SOME

01:42:03.551 --> 01:42:08.522 region:rollup2
OF THE ASSERTIVE.

01:42:06.153 --> 01:42:10.324 region:rollup2
IT HAS TO DO WITH STUDENT DEBT.

01:42:08.522 --> 01:42:12.093 region:rollup2
FOOD AND HOUSING IN SECURITY NOT

01:42:10.324 --> 01:42:13.628 region:rollup2
TO MENTION STUDENT COMPLETION

01:42:12.093 --> 01:42:14.395 region:rollup2
AND SO WE'RE HERE TODAY LIKELY

01:42:13.628 --> 01:42:15.997 region:rollup2
FOR THAT.

01:42:14.395 --> 01:42:17.131 region:rollup2
REASON ALONE IF FINANCIAL AID

01:42:15.997 --> 01:42:18.833 region:rollup2
COVERED EVERYTHING EVERYONE WAS

01:42:17.131 --> 01:42:20.201 region:rollup2
GRADUATING ON TIME WE PROBABLY

01:42:20.201 --> 01:42:22.236 region:rollup2
IT'S OVER HERE THAT SORT OF

01:42:21.102 --> 01:42:24.205 region:rollup2
WE'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY

01:42:22.236 --> 01:42:26.040 region:rollup2
EXAMINES SORT OF THE SYSTEM AND

01:42:24.205 --> 01:42:27.274 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT HOW TO MODERNIZE IT

01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:28.376 region:rollup2
TO MEET THE STUDENT TODAY SO.

01:42:27.274 --> 01:42:29.877 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THE

01:42:28.376 --> 01:42:33.748 region:rollup2
CURRENT FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM AND

01:42:29.877 --> 01:42:35.449 region:rollup2
YOU SHOULD HAVE A ONE PAGER THAT

01:42:33.748 --> 01:42:36.083 region:rollup2
TALKS ABOUT FUTURE FINANCIALLY.

01:42:35.449 --> 01:42:37.151 region:rollup2
AND SO SOME OF THE SHORTCOMINGS

01:42:36.083 --> 01:42:38.185 region:rollup2
--

01:42:37.151 --> 01:42:40.655 region:rollup2
POLICE WITH A COMPETITIVE

01:42:38.185 --> 01:42:42.657 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AND IT'S OUR PROGRAM

01:42:40.655 --> 01:42:43.724 region:rollup2
THAT REALLY TRIES TO MEET THE

01:42:42.657 --> 01:42:45.926 region:rollup2
NEEDS OF OUR NONTRADITIONAL

01:42:43.724 --> 01:42:48.729 region:rollup2

QUALIFY FOR THAT AWARD TO WE

01:42:57.538 --> 01:42:59.173 region:rollup2
HAVE A LOT OF STUDENTS THAT ARE

01:42:58.406 --> 01:43:01.108 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY.

01:42:59.173 --> 01:43:02.309 region:rollup2
NOT BEING COVERED THAT COULD BE

01:43:01.108 --> 01:43:03.978 region:rollup2
COVERED --

01:43:02.309 --> 01:43:05.212 region:rollup2
WITHOUT A WORD SO THAT'S REALLY

01:43:03.978 --> 01:43:06.914 region:rollup2
ONLY ABOUT WE ONLY COVER ABOUT

01:43:05.212 --> 01:43:08.149 region:rollup2
8% OF THE STUDENTS THAT COULD

01:43:06.914 --> 01:43:09.116 region:rollup2
QUALIFY FOR THAT WORD EVEN

01:43:08.149 --> 01:43:10.551 region:rollup2
THOUGH WE TALK ABOUT HOW

01:43:09.116 --> 01:43:12.086 region:rollup2
GENEROUS WE WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL

01:43:10.551 --> 01:43:13.621 region:rollup2
ENTITLEMENT TRANSFER ENTITLEMENT

01:43:12.086 --> 01:43:14.755 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T GOING ALL THE NAMES.

01:43:13.621 --> 01:43:15.890 region:rollup2
BUT WE ARE WE ARE PRETTY

01:43:14.755 --> 01:43:17.491 region:rollup2
GENEROUS --

01:43:15.890 --> 01:43:18.926 region:rollup2
ABOUT THOSE AND THEN OF COURSE

01:43:17.491 --> 01:43:20.795 region:rollup2
WE HAVE THE BE IT CAL GRANT BE

01:43:18.926 --> 01:43:23.264 region:rollup2
ACCESS WORD IN THIS IS PRIMARILY

01:43:20.795 --> 01:43:24.932 region:rollup2
THE THE A FINANCIAL AID THAT

01:43:23.264 --> 01:43:27.301 region:rollup2
PROVIDES FOR LIVING EXPENSES.

01:43:24.932 --> 01:43:27.935 region:rollup2
IT WE PROVIDE ABOUT THOUSAND SIX

01:43:27.301 --> 01:43:29.737 region:rollup2
HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO DOLLARS FOR

01:43:27.935 --> 01:43:31.505 region:rollup2
A FULL TIME STUDENT --

01:43:29.737 --> 01:43:32.807 region:rollup2
AND OF COURSE WE MAKE IT A

01:43:31.505 --> 01:43:34.375 region:rollup2
GUARANTEE IF THE COMING OUT OF

01:43:32.807 --> 01:43:35.810 region:rollup2
HIGH SCHOOL OR GOING DOING A

01:43:34.375 --> 01:43:36.410 region:rollup2
TRANSFER ENTITLEMENT BUT OF

01:43:35.810 --> 01:43:37.578 region:rollup2
COURSE THOSE STUDENTS ON THE

01:43:36.410 --> 01:43:38.579 region:rollup2
COMPETITIVE LIST.

01:43:37.578 --> 01:43:40.948 region:rollup2
ONLY GET THAT ABOUT ONLY 8% OF

01:43:38.579 --> 01:43:42.583 region:rollup2
THOSE ACTUALLY ARE AWARDED THAT

01:43:40.948 --> 01:43:43.451 region:rollup2
NOW IF THAT WOULD THAT AMOUNT

01:43:42.583 --> 01:43:45.186 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE KEPT.

01:43:43.451 --> 01:43:47.021 region:rollup2
KEPT UP WITH THE PRICE OF

01:43:45.186 --> 01:43:48.255 region:rollup2
INFLATION IT WOULD BE WORTH SIX

01:43:47.021 --> 01:43:50.224 region:rollup2
THOUSAND TODAY.

01:43:48.255 --> 01:43:51.425 region:rollup2
SO SIXTEEN SEVENTY TWO SHOULD

01:43:50.224 --> 01:43:52.626 region:rollup2
REALLY BE WORTH SIX THOUSAND

01:43:51.425 --> 01:43:53.694 region:rollup2
THAT COST QUITE A BIT OF MONEY

01:43:52.626 --> 01:43:56.230 region:rollup2
TO TO FUND THAT AND THAT'S KIND

01:43:53.694 --> 01:43:58.165 region:rollup2
OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING TODAY.

01:43:56.230 --> 01:43:59.834 region:rollup2
SO IN ADDITION --

01:43:58.165 --> 01:44:01.902 region:rollup2
WE ALSO WE SAW ONE OF OUR

01:43:59.834 --> 01:44:02.837 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS AS PART OF AND I KNOW

01:44:01.902 --> 01:44:03.404 region:rollup2
THAT --

01:44:02.837 --> 01:44:06.373 region:rollup2
ROBERT HARDMAN HERE TODAY TO

01:44:03.404 --> 01:44:06.874 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT XIN --

01:44:06.373 --> 01:44:07.608 region:rollup2
AND THE REPORT THAT WE

01:44:06.874 --> 01:44:09.744 region:rollup2
COMMISSION THROUGH THE

01:44:07.608 --> 01:44:11.212 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE LED BY ASSEMBLY

01:44:09.744 --> 01:44:12.980 region:rollup2
MEMBER KEVIN MCCARTY --

01:44:11.212 --> 01:44:14.682 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW WE REALLY BELIEVE

01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:16.083 region:rollup2
THAT NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IS TO

01:44:14.682 --> 01:44:18.519 region:rollup2
SUPPORT AN INCREASE IN THE BE

01:44:16.083 --> 01:44:20.054 region:rollup2
ACCESS AWARD WHICH WOULD HELP

01:44:18.519 --> 01:44:22.389 region:rollup2
FUND SOME OF THAT TUITION AND

01:44:20.054 --> 01:44:23.023 region:rollup2
LIVING EXPENSES THAT --

01:44:22.389 --> 01:44:25.126 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ARE CURRENTLY SUFFERING

01:44:23.023 --> 01:44:27.194 region:rollup2
FROM.

01:44:25.126 --> 01:44:29.063 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S ALSO A GAP --

01:44:27.194 --> 01:44:31.265 region:rollup2
LET ME THEY WITH THE GAP IS.

01:44:29.063 --> 01:44:33.000 region:rollup2
SO WE'VE AYE AYE I THINK WE

01:44:31.265 --> 01:44:35.302 region:rollup2
AGREE WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:36.971 region:rollup2

01:44:35.302 --> 01:44:39.306 region:rollup2
OVER THE YEARS WE'VE ATTACK TRY.

01:44:36.971 --> 01:44:41.709 region:rollup2
TO HELP AND AND INCENTIVIZE SORT

01:44:39.306 --> 01:44:43.644 region:rollup2
OF THE CAL GRANT AND SO FOR

01:44:41.709 --> 01:44:45.746 region:rollup2
STUDENTS OF FAMILIES A FOR THAT

01:44:43.644 --> 01:44:47.281 region:rollup2
MAKE UP TO FIFTY THOUSAND YOU

01:44:45.746 --> 01:44:48.716 region:rollup2
CAN HAVE A TWO POINT OH GPA AND

01:44:47.281 --> 01:44:50.017 region:rollup2
GET A CAL GRANT WHICH MEASURE

01:44:48.716 --> 01:44:51.519 region:rollup2
TUITION AND FEES.

01:44:50.017 --> 01:44:53.420 region:rollup2

TO HAVE A THREE POINT NO.

01:44:55.589 --> 01:44:58.559 region:rollup2
BUT ANY STUDENT IN BETWEEN THE

01:44:57.057 --> 01:44:59.894 region:rollup2
TWO POINT OR THROUGH PUERTO THAT

01:44:58.559 --> 01:45:01.629 region:rollup2

NOTHING FROM THE STATE RIGHT AND

01:45:03.464 --> 01:45:06.100 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S THERE'S DEFINITELY A

01:45:04.765 --> 01:45:07.968 region:rollup2
GAP IN A NEED TO SORT OF FILL

01:45:06.100 --> 01:45:09.670 region:rollup2
THAT GAP --

01:45:07.968 --> 01:45:11.205 region:rollup2
AND SO --

01:45:09.670 --> 01:45:13.407 region:rollup2

THE STUDENT YOU KNOW COULD EARN

01:45:29.490 --> 01:45:32.760 region:rollup2
BELOW THREE POINT NO AND WOULD

01:45:31.192 --> 01:45:34.929 region:rollup2
GET NOTHING TO IT SO CLEARLY

01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:35.396 region:rollup2
THERE IN THE NEED BUT THEY THEY

01:45:34.929 --> 01:45:37.531 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T HAVE THAT UP

01:45:35.396 --> 01:45:38.833 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY FIRST YEAR OF

STUDENTS AND SO I KNOW IT'S

01:45:40.367 --> 01:45:42.369 region:rollup2
GOING AND GETTING COMPLICATED

01:45:41.368 --> 01:45:44.905 region:rollup2
HERE BUT PURSUES.

01:45:42.369 --> 01:45:47.041 region:rollup2
SET DID EARNED THAT LIVING AND

01:45:44.905 --> 01:45:48.842 region:rollup2
TUITION THAT THE LIVING EXPENSES

01:45:47.041 --> 01:45:50.678 region:rollup2
PORTION THE BE ACCESS AWARD IN

01:45:48.842 --> 01:45:52.546 region:rollup2
ADDITION TO THAT TUITION FEES

01:45:50.678 --> 01:45:53.380 region:rollup2
FOR THEIR FIRST YEAR.

01:45:52.546 --> 01:45:54.415 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T GET ANYTHING FROM THE

01:45:53.380 --> 01:45:55.716 region:rollup2
STATE --

01:45:54.415 --> 01:45:57.084 region:rollup2
GOING TO A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE

01:45:55.716 --> 01:45:57.985 region:rollup2
THEY GET IN THE SECOND THIRD AND

01:45:57.084 --> 01:46:00.120 region:rollup2
FOURTH YEAR.

01:45:57.985 --> 01:46:00.721 region:rollup2

01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:01.889 region:rollup2
SEVENTY TWO THE FIRST YEAR FOR

01:46:00.721 --> 01:46:03.691 region:rollup2
LIVING EXPENSES NOW.

01:46:01.889 --> 01:46:06.827 region:rollup2
THE UC ISSUES YOU MAY --

01:46:03.691 --> 01:46:07.861 region:rollup2
PROVIDE THAT TUITION BUT YOU

01:46:06.827 --> 01:46:09.730 region:rollup2
KNOW I DON'T MUCH OF THE PRIVATE

01:46:07.861 --> 01:46:11.398 region:rollup2
POLLARD WHOM BUT OF THE STATE

01:46:09.730 --> 01:46:13.200 region:rollup2
DOESN'T PROVIDED.

01:46:11.398 --> 01:46:15.102 region:rollup2
AND SO THIS --

01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:16.237 region:rollup2
THAT WAS ESTABLISHED --

01:46:15.102 --> 01:46:17.438 region:rollup2
IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND

01:46:16.237 --> 01:46:18.706 region:rollup2
THAT NEVER CHANGE BECAUSE THEY

01:46:17.438 --> 01:46:19.807 region:rollup2
ASSUME THAT ALL CAL GRANT

01:46:18.706 --> 01:46:21.075 region:rollup2
BEESTON'S WERE ACTUALLY GOING TO

01:46:19.807 --> 01:46:22.376 region:rollup2
COMMUNICABLE IT.

01:46:21.075 --> 01:46:24.345 region:rollup2
AND WORK GOING STRAIGHT INTO A

01:46:22.376 --> 01:46:25.846 region:rollup2
FOUR YEAR SO THAT'S ANOTHER --

01:46:24.345 --> 01:46:27.314 region:rollup2
SORT OF IOWA STATE EASY FIX BUT

01:46:25.846 --> 01:46:27.848 region:rollup2
COULD BE FIXED AND TO PROVIDE

01:46:27.314 --> 01:46:29.016 region:rollup2
THE STUDENTS THAT FOR YOUR

01:46:27.848 --> 01:46:30.317 region:rollup2
COVERAGE.

01:46:29.016 --> 01:46:32.519 region:rollup2
SO THE FUTURE SO WHAT WHAT WE

01:46:30.317 --> 01:46:35.656 region:rollup2
ENVISION.

01:46:32.519 --> 01:46:37.324 region:rollup2
A SO WE ENVISION A SYSTEM THAT

01:46:35.656 --> 01:46:39.526 region:rollup2
ADDRESSES THE TOTAL COST OF

01:46:37.324 --> 01:46:41.028 region:rollup2
ATTENDANCE A BEYOND JUST TUITION

01:46:39.526 --> 01:46:42.329 region:rollup2
AND FEES AS WE'VE BEEN TALKING

01:46:41.028 --> 01:46:43.397 region:rollup2
TO YOU ABOUT HERE TODAY.

01:46:42.329 --> 01:46:44.598 region:rollup2
LETTING BECAUSE THE COSTS

01:46:43.397 --> 01:46:46.133 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH LIVING EXPENSES

01:46:44.598 --> 01:46:47.901 region:rollup2
HAS OUTPACED THE RISING TUITION

01:46:46.133 --> 01:46:50.070 region:rollup2
AND FEES COSTS.

01:46:47.901 --> 01:46:53.407 region:rollup2
SO ONE OF THE THE COMMISSIONERS

01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:54.742 region:rollup2
AND MY NUMBER ONE PRIORITIES AS

01:46:53.407 --> 01:46:56.477 region:rollup2
FOR THAT STILL NEED COMMISSION

01:46:54.742 --> 01:46:57.811 region:rollup2
IS TO REINSTATE THAT SEARS

01:46:56.477 --> 01:46:59.380 region:rollup2
SURVEY WHICH IS THAT STUDENT

01:46:57.811 --> 01:47:00.214 region:rollup2
EXPENSE AND RESOURCES SURVEY TO

01:46:59.380 --> 01:47:03.250 region:rollup2
REALLY FIND OUT.

01:47:00.214 --> 01:47:05.152 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH OUR STUDENTS PAYING FOR

01:47:03.250 --> 01:47:08.522 region:rollup2
AND SO AT ALL FIVE SEGMENTS AND

01:47:05.152 --> 01:47:09.123 region:rollup2
SO IT WAS SUSPENDED AND THAT TWO

01:47:08.522 --> 01:47:09.590 region:rollup2
THOUSAND SIX SEVEN BECAUSE OF

01:47:09.123 --> 01:47:11.558 region:rollup2
BUDGET CUTS AND WE'VE

01:47:09.590 --> 01:47:13.527 region:rollup2
REINSTITUTED IT --

01:47:11.558 --> 01:47:15.596 region:rollup2
THIS LAST SPRING WE DID A PILOT

01:47:13.527 --> 01:47:16.730 region:rollup2
AND WE DID A PILOT AT OVER FIFTY

01:47:15.596 --> 01:47:18.632 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO EIGHTY

01:47:16.730 --> 01:47:19.633 region:rollup2
THOUSAND STUDENTS.

01:47:18.632 --> 01:47:21.035 region:rollup2
AND ALL PROVIDE YOU SOME

01:47:19.633 --> 01:47:22.770 region:rollup2
PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE WE ARE

01:47:21.035 --> 01:47:23.404 region:rollup2
GOING TO DO THE LARGER ONE THIS

01:47:22.770 --> 01:47:25.506 region:rollup2
NOVEMBER WITH ALL FIVE SEGMENTS

01:47:23.404 --> 01:47:27.107 region:rollup2
BUT I CAN LET YOU KNOW NOW THAT

01:47:25.506 --> 01:47:28.075 region:rollup2
THE PILOT SURVEY DID FIND

01:47:27.107 --> 01:47:30.878 region:rollup2
HOUSING AND FOOD.

01:47:28.075 --> 01:47:32.713 region:rollup2
OF WAS SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER THAN

01:47:30.878 --> 01:47:34.181 region:rollup2
WHAT THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX

01:47:32.713 --> 01:47:34.982 region:rollup2
WAS SUGGESTING SWITCH REALLY

01:47:34.181 --> 01:47:36.317 region:rollup2
THING WE WOULD DO SINCE I WAS

01:47:34.982 --> 01:47:36.817 region:rollup2
SIX OR SEVEN IT INCREASE IT BY

01:47:36.317 --> 01:47:38.285 region:rollup2
CONSUMER PRICE INDEX AND

01:47:36.817 --> 01:47:40.220 region:rollup2
CLEARLY.

01:47:38.285 --> 01:47:41.889 region:rollup2
THAT WASN'T KEEPING UP AND SO I

01:47:40.220 --> 01:47:43.390 region:rollup2
CAN TELL YOU NOW THAT --

01:47:41.889 --> 01:47:44.658 region:rollup2
THAT WE WERE OFF.

01:47:43.390 --> 01:47:46.093 region:rollup2
BUT WITH FOODS AND FOOD AND

01:47:44.658 --> 01:47:48.195 region:rollup2
HOUSING FOR SHORE --

01:47:46.093 --> 01:47:50.097 region:rollup2
AND SO I WERE REALLY SCIENTISTS

01:47:48.195 --> 01:47:51.365 region:rollup2
ARE REINSTITUTE OUT WE ALSO --

01:47:50.097 --> 01:47:53.567 region:rollup2
I MENTIONED EARLIER WE

01:47:51.365 --> 01:47:54.868 region:rollup2
COMMISSIONED A REPORT AND A

01:47:53.567 --> 01:47:57.004 region:rollup2
RUBBER SHARMAN GOING TO TALK

01:47:54.868 --> 01:47:58.739 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT TODAY OF THE THROUGH

01:47:57.004 --> 01:48:00.507 region:rollup2
THE CENTURY FOUNDATION.

01:47:58.739 --> 01:48:02.376 region:rollup2
AND THE SOME OF THE

01:48:00.507 --> 01:48:03.911 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS IN THAT --

01:48:02.376 --> 01:48:05.512 region:rollup2
WE'RE SUPPORTING WHICH IS A

01:48:03.911 --> 01:48:07.881 region:rollup2
VISION FOR FINANCIALLY THAT

01:48:05.512 --> 01:48:09.616 region:rollup2
STREAMLINES IT MAKES IT A SINGLE

01:48:07.881 --> 01:48:11.151 region:rollup2
STATE GRANT AID PROGRAM A IT

01:48:09.616 --> 01:48:12.753 region:rollup2
MAKES OVERALL COST OF ATTENDANCE

01:48:11.151 --> 01:48:14.221 region:rollup2
MANAGEABLE FOR LOW INCOME AND

01:48:12.753 --> 01:48:15.489 region:rollup2
MIDDLE INCOME STUDENTS.

01:48:14.221 --> 01:48:16.924 region:rollup2
BY REDUCING THE NEED TO RELY AND

01:48:15.489 --> 01:48:18.292 region:rollup2
LOAN THAT INCREASING THE AMOUNT

01:48:16.924 --> 01:48:20.327 region:rollup2
OF AID TO STUDENTS WITH HIGHEST

01:48:18.292 --> 01:48:21.228 region:rollup2
OVERALL NEED AND DOUBLING DOWN

01:48:20.327 --> 01:48:22.229 region:rollup2
THE STATE'S COMMITMENT TO

01:48:21.228 --> 01:48:23.630 region:rollup2
COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY.

01:48:22.229 --> 01:48:25.232 region:rollup2
AND THOUGH IT WOULD CLOSE UP

01:48:23.630 --> 01:48:26.367 region:rollup2
SOME OF THOSE GAPS SO THE FIRST

01:48:25.232 --> 01:48:28.469 region:rollup2
PHASE OF IT INCREASE THE BE

01:48:26.367 --> 01:48:29.236 region:rollup2
ACCESS WORK LIVING EXPENSES THE

01:48:28.469 --> 01:48:31.005 region:rollup2
SECOND PHASE FOR US.

01:48:29.236 --> 01:48:32.339 region:rollup2
AND IN OREGON THE COMMISSIONERS

01:48:31.005 --> 01:48:33.474 region:rollup2
HAVE SUPPORTED IS A THANKLESS

01:48:32.339 --> 01:48:35.109 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATED MAKE IT EASIER TO

01:48:33.474 --> 01:48:36.243 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND MUSIC EASIER TO

01:48:35.109 --> 01:48:37.211 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATE --

01:48:36.243 --> 01:48:38.912 region:rollup2
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT

01:48:37.211 --> 01:48:40.180 region:rollup2
A BNC TWO POINT A THREE POINT

01:48:38.912 --> 01:48:42.449 region:rollup2
OPEN UP THE FIRST YEAR BUT IN

01:48:40.180 --> 01:48:42.983 region:rollup2
THE SECOND YOU KNOW AND SO I WE

01:48:42.449 --> 01:48:43.751 region:rollup2
WANT TO BE ABLE TO EASILY

01:48:42.983 --> 01:48:46.186 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND.

01:48:43.751 --> 01:48:46.453 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE THIRD PART REALLY.

01:48:46.186 --> 01:48:47.021 region:rollup2
IS -- AND

01:48:46.453 --> 01:48:49.857 region:rollup2
THEN BRINGING IN THE MIDDLE

01:48:47.021 --> 01:48:50.491 region:rollup2
CLASS.

01:48:49.857 --> 01:48:52.259 region:rollup2
SMALLER BUT A FIRST THOUGHT SO

01:48:50.491 --> 01:48:53.594 region:rollup2
WE EXPAND THE CAL GRANT AND SO

01:48:52.259 --> 01:48:55.129 region:rollup2
WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR FIRE FIVE

01:48:53.594 --> 01:48:56.497 region:rollup2
SITE HIGHER ITS EGGMAN TO REALLY

01:48:55.129 --> 01:48:57.097 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT COULD LOOK

01:48:56.497 --> 01:48:58.132 region:rollup2
LIKE WHAT WITH THAT WOULD COST

01:48:57.097 --> 01:49:00.567 region:rollup2
--

01:48:58.132 --> 01:49:01.902 region:rollup2
BUT THEN LESLIE REALLY IS YOU

01:49:00.567 --> 01:49:03.437 region:rollup2
KNOW THERE'S A DESIRE BY IT

01:49:01.902 --> 01:49:05.272 region:rollup2
DEFINITELY SOME OF THE SEGMENTS

01:49:03.437 --> 01:49:06.473 region:rollup2
HIGHER ED SEGMENTS AS YOU KNOW

01:49:05.272 --> 01:49:07.307 region:rollup2
THAT'S JUST RESTOCKING THE BACK

01:49:06.473 --> 01:49:08.275 region:rollup2
LIKE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER SAID

01:49:07.307 --> 01:49:09.243 region:rollup2
ON THE TITANIC.

01:49:08.275 --> 01:49:10.978 region:rollup2
DOESN'T REALLY BENEFIT COMMITTEE

01:49:09.243 --> 01:49:13.747 region:rollup2
COSTUMES FOR INSTANCE BECAUSE

01:49:10.978 --> 01:49:16.617 region:rollup2
THEY IT WE HAVE A TIERED SYSTEM.

01:49:13.747 --> 01:49:17.918 region:rollup2
OF ADMISSION AND FINANCIAL AID.

01:49:16.617 --> 01:49:19.586 region:rollup2
SO THE HIGH THE MORE PRESTIGE

01:49:17.918 --> 01:49:21.388 region:rollup2
THAT INSTITUTION THE MORE

01:49:19.586 --> 01:49:22.423 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL AID WE PROVIDE THE

01:49:21.388 --> 01:49:23.991 region:rollup2
INSTITUTION AND THAT STUDENT AND

01:49:22.423 --> 01:49:25.059 region:rollup2
SO GUESS WHO GETS LEFT OUT.

01:49:23.991 --> 01:49:26.493 region:rollup2
THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS

01:49:25.059 --> 01:49:27.795 region:rollup2
RIGHT THEY DON'T GET AS MUCH AID

01:49:26.493 --> 01:49:29.430 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:49:27.795 --> 01:49:30.264 region:rollup2
AND THE GOVERNOR HAS DONE SO

01:49:29.430 --> 01:49:31.532 region:rollup2
MUCH MORE WITH THE CALIFORNIA

01:49:30.264 --> 01:49:33.634 region:rollup2
PROMISES LAST.

01:49:31.532 --> 01:49:35.803 region:rollup2
YEAR AT TO TO REALLY BOOST THAT

01:49:33.634 --> 01:49:37.838 region:rollup2
AND AND A AN INCREASE THAT.

01:49:35.803 --> 01:49:38.672 region:rollup2
BUT IN ADDITION I HAD MENTIONED

01:49:37.838 --> 01:49:40.140 region:rollup2
CAL GRANT SEEN THOSE OUR

01:49:38.672 --> 01:49:42.209 region:rollup2
STUDENTS SEEKING A CAREER

01:49:40.140 --> 01:49:43.911 region:rollup2
TECHNICAL EDUCATION.

01:49:42.209 --> 01:49:46.513 region:rollup2
WE UP UNTIL RECENTLY PROVIDED

01:49:43.911 --> 01:49:47.147 region:rollup2

01:49:46.513 --> 01:49:48.649 region:rollup2
FIVE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN DOLLARS

01:49:47.147 --> 01:49:51.151 region:rollup2
WITH UP TO TWO THOUSAND BUT IT'S

01:49:48.649 --> 01:49:52.019 region:rollup2
A LESS THAN THE SEVEN SIXTEEN

01:49:51.151 --> 01:49:53.387 region:rollup2
SEVENTY TWO SO SOMEHOW THEY'RE

01:49:52.019 --> 01:49:55.422 region:rollup2
EDUCATION IS VALUED LAUGHS.

01:49:53.387 --> 01:49:57.091 region:rollup2
AS A HOW TO INCORPORATE THEM IN

01:49:55.422 --> 01:49:57.958 region:rollup2
THIS OVERHAUL SO THE THIRD PHASE

01:49:57.091 --> 01:49:59.726 region:rollup2
IS REALLY AN OVERHAUL AND

01:49:57.958 --> 01:50:01.395 region:rollup2
PROVIDING A REGIONALIZED

01:49:59.726 --> 01:50:03.697 region:rollup2
EXPECTED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION.

01:50:01.395 --> 01:50:05.899 region:rollup2

FINANCIALLY TOTALLY BESIDE JUST

01:50:05.899 --> 01:50:08.368 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATING IN MAKING EASIER

01:50:06.900 --> 01:50:10.370 region:rollup2
TO UNDERSTAND REALLY.

01:50:08.368 --> 01:50:12.606 region:rollup2
WHAT SHOULD WE DO WITH REGARDS

01:50:10.370 --> 01:50:13.640 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDING A TOTAL COST OF

01:50:12.606 --> 01:50:15.175 region:rollup2
ATTENDANCE TO A STUDENT?

01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:16.577 region:rollup2

01:52:32.579 --> 01:52:37.818 region:rollup2
GRANTS OR THROUGH INSTITUTIONAL

01:52:34.514 --> 01:52:40.287 region:rollup2
AID OR SOME COMBINATION SO I'M

01:52:37.818 --> 01:52:41.822 region:rollup2
WE WE SHOULD TAKE SOME PRIDE IN

01:52:40.287 --> 01:52:44.024 region:rollup2
THAT -- AT

01:52:41.822 --> 01:52:46.226 region:rollup2
THE SAME TIME WE DID FIND THAT

01:52:44.024 --> 01:52:48.895 region:rollup2
MORE AID MORE GRANT AID IS

01:52:46.226 --> 01:52:51.298 region:rollup2
NEEDED ESPECIALLY TO ADDRESS NON

01:52:48.895 --> 01:52:53.266 region:rollup2
TUITION EXPENSES AND ESPECIALLY

01:52:51.298 --> 01:52:57.604 region:rollup2
AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHERE

01:52:53.266 --> 01:53:01.408 region:rollup2
THE THE AID PROGRAMS ARE ARE --

01:52:57.604 --> 01:53:04.945 region:rollup2
JUST NOT NOT AVAIL I IN THE

01:53:01.408 --> 01:53:08.048 region:rollup2
SEGMENTS WE ALSO FOUND A SERIOUS

01:53:04.945 --> 01:53:10.884 region:rollup2
LACK OF COORDINATION AMONG THE

01:53:08.048 --> 01:53:13.754 region:rollup2
VARIOUS PIECES OF THIS FINANCIAL

01:53:10.884 --> 01:53:17.991 region:rollup2
AID PUZZLE THAT MAKES THINGS

01:53:13.754 --> 01:53:19.293 region:rollup2
HARD FOR STUDENTS AND FOR

01:53:17.991 --> 01:53:20.794 region:rollup2
ANYBODY IN.

01:53:19.293 --> 01:53:21.395 region:rollup2
INVOLVED IN THE ADMINISTRATION

01:53:20.794 --> 01:53:23.864 region:rollup2
OF THE PROGRAM WHETHER THAT IS

01:53:21.395 --> 01:53:25.632 region:rollup2
--

01:53:23.864 --> 01:53:27.267 region:rollup2
FOLKS AT K. TWELVE SCHOOLS WHO

01:53:25.632 --> 01:53:30.537 region:rollup2
WERE TRYING TO PROVIDE GPA

01:53:27.267 --> 01:53:32.139 region:rollup2
INFORMATION TO FOLKS OUT WORKING

01:53:30.537 --> 01:53:33.940 region:rollup2
IN -- THE

01:53:32.139 --> 01:53:37.311 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL AID OFFICES AT

01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:38.845 region:rollup2
COLLEGES AND A AND UNIVERSITIES.

01:53:37.311 --> 01:53:41.048 region:rollup2
WE SUGGESTED --

01:53:38.845 --> 01:53:43.850 region:rollup2
WE'VE OUR RECOMMENDATIONS WERE

01:53:41.048 --> 01:53:45.385 region:rollup2
THAT CALIFORNIA ADOPT A A NEW

01:53:43.850 --> 01:53:46.720 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK --

01:53:45.385 --> 01:53:49.456 region:rollup2
TO TO ITS A FINANCIAL AID

01:53:46.720 --> 01:53:51.324 region:rollup2
FUNDING SIMPLIFYING THE SYSTEM

01:53:49.456 --> 01:53:52.726 region:rollup2
ELIMINATING A LOT OF THAT THE

01:53:51.324 --> 01:53:54.828 region:rollup2
RED RED TAPE.

01:53:52.726 --> 01:53:56.496 region:rollup2
UP BY HAVING ONE CAL GRANT WE

01:53:54.828 --> 01:53:57.998 region:rollup2
INSIST.

01:53:56.496 --> 01:53:59.366 region:rollup2
I DIDN'T PUT THIS ON THE SLIDE

01:53:57.998 --> 01:54:01.001 region:rollup2
BUT WE THOUGHT OF THIS AS KIND

01:53:59.366 --> 01:54:03.303 region:rollup2
OF A SPREAD AND STACK APPROACH

01:54:01.001 --> 01:54:06.773 region:rollup2
SO.

01:54:03.303 --> 01:54:10.310 region:rollup2
ALL ALL CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS.

01:54:06.773 --> 01:54:12.479 region:rollup2
A ELIGIBLE BASED ON THEIR NEED

01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:15.849 region:rollup2
FOR A CAL GRANT --

01:54:12.479 --> 01:54:17.250 region:rollup2
PLUS THE INSTITUTIONAL AID GOING

01:54:15.849 --> 01:54:19.753 region:rollup2
ON TOP OF THAT.

01:54:17.250 --> 01:54:22.055 region:rollup2
AIMING TOWARD AND AFFORDABILITY

01:54:19.753 --> 01:54:24.191 region:rollup2
TARGET THE AFFORDABILITY TARGET

01:54:22.055 --> 01:54:25.792 region:rollup2
TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION UP ALL

01:54:24.191 --> 01:54:27.661 region:rollup2
OF THE STUDENTS IS STUDENTS

01:54:25.792 --> 01:54:30.530 region:rollup2
EXPENSES TUITION TUITION AND

01:54:27.661 --> 01:54:33.333 region:rollup2
FEES BUT ALSO LIVING EXPENSES

01:54:30.530 --> 01:54:35.469 region:rollup2
BOOKS TRANSPORTATION AND WHICH

01:54:33.333 --> 01:54:37.137 region:rollup2
REALLY ARE THE AREAS WHERE WE

01:54:35.469 --> 01:54:39.172 region:rollup2
ARE MOST LACKING IN THE STATE IN

01:54:37.137 --> 01:54:39.439 region:rollup2
TERMS OF IN TERMS OF SUPPORT FOR

01:54:39.172 --> 01:54:40.240 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

01:54:39.439 --> 01:54:43.744 region:rollup2
AGAIN ESPECIALLY AT THE

01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:46.313 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY --

01:54:43.744 --> 01:54:48.548 region:rollup2
BUT THAT THE US DID NAY

01:54:46.313 --> 01:54:50.784 region:rollup2
COMMISSION AND COLLEGES WOULD BE

01:54:48.548 --> 01:54:52.953 region:rollup2
WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP TO MAKE

01:54:50.784 --> 01:54:54.921 region:rollup2
SURE THAT STUDENTS RECEIVE

01:54:52.953 --> 01:54:57.591 region:rollup2
ENOUGH GRANT AID WHERE THEY DO

01:54:54.921 --> 01:54:59.126 region:rollup2
NOT HAVE TO EITHER TAKE OUT THE

01:54:57.591 --> 01:55:01.628 region:rollup2
EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF LOANS.

01:54:59.126 --> 01:55:04.264 region:rollup2
OR WORK TOO MUCH IN ORDER TO

01:55:01.628 --> 01:55:06.800 region:rollup2
COMPLETE THEIR HIGHER EDUCATION

01:55:04.264 --> 01:55:09.436 region:rollup2
AS A PART OF ALL OF THAT --

01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:11.638 region:rollup2
WE RECOMMEND SHIFTING FROM A

01:55:09.436 --> 01:55:14.741 region:rollup2
SOLELY A TUITION FOCUS IN TERMS

01:55:11.638 --> 01:55:18.345 region:rollup2
OF THE CAL GRANT SO THAT THE

01:55:14.741 --> 01:55:20.213 region:rollup2
OVERARCHING GOAL IS NOT JUST

01:55:18.345 --> 01:55:21.915 region:rollup2
TUITION COVERAGE BUT COLLEGE

01:55:20.213 --> 01:55:24.918 region:rollup2
AFFORDABILITY.

01:55:21.915 --> 01:55:26.553 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S USEFUL --

01:55:24.918 --> 01:55:28.422 region:rollup2
TO AT I REALLY ENJOY DOCTOR

01:55:26.553 --> 01:55:29.523 region:rollup2
WEBBER'S QUESTION.

01:55:28.422 --> 01:55:31.024 region:rollup2
AND HAVE HAD --

01:55:29.523 --> 01:55:31.591 region:rollup2
IT IT IT WAS USEFUL TO HAVE A

01:55:31.024 --> 01:55:33.460 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO THINK

01:55:31.591 --> 01:55:35.362 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW HOW TO ADDRESS IT

01:55:33.460 --> 01:55:36.730 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT WAS A HUGE QUESTION

01:55:35.362 --> 01:55:37.664 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO KIND OF THE RIGHT

01:55:36.730 --> 01:55:39.332 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

01:55:37.664 --> 01:55:39.866 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU YOU CERTAINLY COULD

01:55:39.332 --> 01:55:43.737 region:rollup2
IMAGINE A SYSTEM WHERE THE

01:55:39.866 --> 01:55:47.073 region:rollup2
STATE.

01:55:43.737 --> 01:55:49.443 region:rollup2
PROVIDED FUNDING TO INSTITUTIONS

01:55:47.073 --> 01:55:51.711 region:rollup2
FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE

01:55:49.443 --> 01:55:53.246 region:rollup2
THE INSTRUCTION AND SUPPORT THAT

01:55:51.711 --> 01:55:55.982 region:rollup2
STUDENTS NEED.

01:55:53.246 --> 01:55:57.217 region:rollup2
AND TO PROVIDE STUDENTS TO

01:55:55.982 --> 01:55:59.553 region:rollup2
PROVIDE EITHER ALL STUDENTS OR

01:55:57.217 --> 01:56:00.454 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY STUDENTS WITH NEED

01:55:59.553 --> 01:56:03.323 region:rollup2
WITH --

01:56:00.454 --> 01:56:04.891 region:rollup2
LIVING EXPENSES SUPPORT --

01:56:03.323 --> 01:56:06.827 region:rollup2
OF BOOKS AT SET RIGHT NOW

01:56:04.891 --> 01:56:08.895 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THAT WOULD BE VERY

01:56:06.827 --> 01:56:11.731 region:rollup2
VERY EXPENSIVE FOR THE STATE TO

01:56:08.895 --> 01:56:14.134 region:rollup2
PAY FOR ALL OF THAT.

01:56:11.731 --> 01:56:15.836 region:rollup2
FOR EVERY UP RESIDENT INTERESTED

01:56:14.134 --> 01:56:17.237 region:rollup2
IN IT AND ENROLLING IN HIGHER

01:56:15.836 --> 01:56:19.072 region:rollup2
EDUCATION.

01:56:17.237 --> 01:56:21.508 region:rollup2
BUT IF YOU BACK AWAY FROM THAT

01:56:19.072 --> 01:56:24.544 region:rollup2
MODEL AND SAY WELL WHAT IF WHAT

01:56:21.508 --> 01:56:27.314 region:rollup2
THE STATE WAS COMMITTING TO WAS

01:56:24.544 --> 01:56:30.650 region:rollup2
SUPPORTING A ENOUGH GRANT TAPE

01:56:27.314 --> 01:56:33.253 region:rollup2
SO THAT ALL OF THOSE STUDENTS.

01:56:30.650 --> 01:56:36.556 region:rollup2
I EDUCATIONS WOULD BE AFFORDABLE

01:56:33.253 --> 01:56:40.560 region:rollup2
GIVEN THEIR ABILITY TO PAY.

01:56:36.556 --> 01:56:43.063 region:rollup2
THAT IS CLOSER TO WHAT WE SORT

01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:44.998 region:rollup2
OF HAVE AS A SYSTEM NOW AND THE

01:56:43.063 --> 01:56:46.766 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THAT WE ARE RECOMMENDING

01:56:44.998 --> 01:56:49.302 region:rollup2
BE -- THAT

01:56:46.766 --> 01:56:50.937 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THAT THE UP GAPS BE

01:56:49.302 --> 01:56:53.106 region:rollup2
FILLED --

01:56:50.937 --> 01:56:54.574 region:rollup2
AND SIMPLE OUR APPROACHES TO

01:56:53.106 --> 01:56:56.576 region:rollup2
GETTING INFORMATION ABOUT A BE

01:56:54.574 --> 01:56:57.744 region:rollup2
CREATED SO THAT WE WOULD HAVE A

01:56:56.576 --> 01:56:59.613 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WHERE.

01:56:57.744 --> 01:57:01.615 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY CAN GO TO COLLEGE IT

01:56:59.613 --> 01:57:02.916 region:rollup2
WILL BE AFFORDABLE FOR THEM

01:57:01.615 --> 01:57:04.818 region:rollup2
IT'LL BE AFFORDABLE --

01:57:02.916 --> 01:57:06.720 region:rollup2
THAT PREDICTABLY AFFORDABLE FROM

01:57:04.818 --> 01:57:08.688 region:rollup2
THE STANDPOINT OF EVEN EVEN

01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:11.191 region:rollup2
THEIR CHANGING ECONOMIC FAMILY

01:57:08.688 --> 01:57:13.226 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC SITUATION SO THAT WHEN

01:57:11.191 --> 01:57:16.329 region:rollup2
WHEN WE HAVE A RECESSION --

01:57:13.226 --> 01:57:17.831 region:rollup2
AID GOES UP TO SO THAT IT SO

01:57:16.329 --> 01:57:20.066 region:rollup2
THAT IT BECOMES AN AFFORDABLE

01:57:17.831 --> 01:57:21.968 region:rollup2
KIND OF APPROACH SO THAT'S WHAT

01:57:20.066 --> 01:57:23.904 region:rollup2
WE AIM FOR IN KIND OF A THREE

01:57:21.968 --> 01:57:25.772 region:rollup2
STEP --

01:57:23.904 --> 01:57:27.641 region:rollup2
APPROACH WITH THE WITH A FIRST

01:57:25.772 --> 01:57:29.509 region:rollup2
STEP BEING LET'S BOLSTER THAT

01:57:27.641 --> 01:57:31.511 region:rollup2
CAL GRANT BE AWARD TO ADDRESS

01:57:29.509 --> 01:57:33.280 region:rollup2
THE BIGGEST HOLE THAT WE HAVE

01:57:31.511 --> 01:57:34.748 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW BUT GIVEN THAT WE'RE

01:57:33.280 --> 01:57:37.417 region:rollup2
TALKING KIND OF MASTER PLAN AND

01:57:34.748 --> 01:57:40.053 region:rollup2
LONG TERM --

01:57:37.417 --> 01:57:42.722 region:rollup2
THAT LOOK THAT OVERARCHING GOAL

01:57:40.053 --> 01:57:44.925 region:rollup2
OF LET'S MAKE SURE THAT.

01:57:42.722 --> 01:57:47.394 region:rollup2
A QUALITY COLLEGE EDUCATION IS

01:57:44.925 --> 01:57:49.930 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE TO ALL CALIFORNIA

01:57:47.394 --> 01:57:51.231 region:rollup2
CITIZENS AND RESIDENTS --

01:57:49.930 --> 01:57:53.233 region:rollup2
IS ACHIEVABLE.

01:57:51.231 --> 01:57:54.301 region:rollup2
WE WANTED TO ALSO EMPHASIZE SOME

01:57:53.233 --> 01:57:56.369 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT --

01:57:54.301 --> 01:57:58.171 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:57:56.369 --> 01:58:00.073 region:rollup2
COULD BE DONE.

01:57:58.171 --> 01:58:03.043 region:rollup2
BUT ARE NOT --

01:58:00.073 --> 01:58:05.378 region:rollup2
DON'T NECESSARILY REQUIRE UP A

01:58:03.043 --> 01:58:06.579 region:rollup2
LARGE AMOUNT OF FUNDING SO IN MY

01:58:05.378 --> 01:58:07.914 region:rollup2
WRITTEN TESTIMONY THAT I

01:58:06.579 --> 01:58:09.783 region:rollup2
PROVIDED --

01:58:07.914 --> 01:58:12.886 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT PROVIDING EARLY

01:58:09.783 --> 01:58:14.521 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL AID INFORMATION.

01:58:12.886 --> 01:58:16.356 region:rollup2
AFFORDABILITY INFORMATION THAT

01:58:14.521 --> 01:58:18.592 region:rollup2
TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION CAL

01:58:16.356 --> 01:58:21.428 region:rollup2
GRANTS AS WELL AS INSTITUTIONAL.

01:58:18.592 --> 01:58:23.330 region:rollup2
AID IF WE WERE TO MOVE ALL OF

01:58:21.428 --> 01:58:24.764 region:rollup2
THE INTER COMMUNICATION

01:58:23.330 --> 01:58:28.034 region:rollup2
INTERACTIONS THAT OCCUR.

01:58:24.764 --> 01:58:30.670 region:rollup2
UP RIGHT NOW BETWEEN ROUGHLY UP

01:58:28.034 --> 01:58:33.173 region:rollup2
SEPTEMBER OF A OF A STUDENTS

01:58:30.670 --> 01:58:34.941 region:rollup2
HIGH SCHOOL YEAR --

01:58:33.173 --> 01:58:37.143 region:rollup2
IF THE BAND AND THE SIX OR NINE

01:58:34.941 --> 01:58:38.411 region:rollup2
MONTHS AYE AFTER THAT IF WE WERE

01:58:37.143 --> 01:58:39.813 region:rollup2
TO MOVE WITH THAT LEVEL OF

01:58:38.411 --> 01:58:40.680 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THIS

01:58:39.813 --> 01:58:41.548 region:rollup2
DEBATE COMMISSION AND THOSE

01:58:40.680 --> 01:58:44.317 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

01:58:41.548 --> 01:58:45.652 region:rollup2
A YEAR OR TWO YEARS EARLIER.

01:58:44.317 --> 01:58:48.188 region:rollup2
THEY COULD ACTUALLY HAVE

01:58:45.652 --> 01:58:50.991 region:rollup2
INFORMATION THAT WOULD COMPARE.

01:58:48.188 --> 01:58:52.726 region:rollup2
COST TO THEM AT A CSU CAMPUS A

01:58:50.991 --> 01:58:53.960 region:rollup2
UC CAMPUS A PRIVATE COLLEGE

01:58:52.726 --> 01:58:56.429 region:rollup2
CAMPUS --

01:58:53.960 --> 01:58:57.964 region:rollup2
SHOW THEM THEIR OPTIONS HELP

01:58:56.429 --> 01:59:00.166 region:rollup2
THEM TO MAKE.

01:58:57.964 --> 01:59:02.102 region:rollup2
DECISIONS THAT WOULD WORK WELL

01:59:00.166 --> 01:59:04.237 region:rollup2
FOR THEM GIVEN THEIR BACKGROUNDS

01:59:02.102 --> 01:59:06.973 region:rollup2
GIVEN THEIR INTERESTS HELPING TO

01:59:04.237 --> 01:59:09.843 region:rollup2
PLAN FOR COLLEGE BETTER --

01:59:06.973 --> 01:59:11.544 region:rollup2
WITHOUT INCREASING OUR COSTS

01:59:09.843 --> 01:59:12.946 region:rollup2
FROM WHAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS

01:59:11.544 --> 01:59:15.548 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW SO --

01:59:12.946 --> 01:59:17.350 region:rollup2
I STILL I I SOMETIMES WORRY THAT

01:59:15.548 --> 01:59:18.952 region:rollup2
THE FOCUS ON PUTTING MORE MONEY

01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:21.955 region:rollup2
INTO FINANCIAL AID --

01:59:18.952 --> 01:59:23.490 region:rollup2
WE'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME.

01:59:21.955 --> 01:59:25.225 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WE COULD DO TO

01:59:23.490 --> 01:59:27.360 region:rollup2
ADDRESS COMPLEXITY AND

01:59:25.225 --> 01:59:29.129 region:rollup2
INFORMATION THAT WOULD IMPROVE

01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:31.464 region:rollup2
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF WHAT WE'RE

01:59:29.129 --> 01:59:33.733 region:rollup2
SPENDING NOW IT'S NOT ENOUGH

01:59:31.464 --> 01:59:35.568 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT WITH US SOLUTION --

01:59:33.733 --> 01:59:36.569 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK IT'S USEFUL TO KIND

01:59:35.568 --> 01:59:36.870 region:rollup2
OF MOVE ON BOTH TRACKS

01:59:36.569 --> 01:59:40.373 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:59:36.870 --> 01:59:43.410 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:59:40.373 --> 01:59:46.279 region:rollup2
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:59:43.410 --> 01:59:48.148 region:rollup2
I MISSED MEDINA CHAIRMAN DANA.

01:59:46.279 --> 01:59:49.849 region:rollup2
BUT THANK YOU TO THE PANEL FOR

01:59:48.148 --> 01:59:51.551 region:rollup2
PROVIDING INFORMATION AND I DO

01:59:49.849 --> 01:59:52.152 region:rollup2
THINK A LOT OF INTERESTING

01:59:51.551 --> 01:59:53.286 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP

01:59:52.152 --> 01:59:54.988 region:rollup2
--

01:59:53.286 --> 01:59:56.222 region:rollup2
BY DOCTOR WEBER AND AND WHEN I

01:59:54.988 --> 01:59:57.223 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT FINANCIAL AID I DO

01:59:56.222 --> 01:59:59.059 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT [inaudible]

01:59:57.223 --> 02:00:00.794 region:rollup2
ACCESSIBILITY.

01:59:59.059 --> 02:00:02.796 region:rollup2
AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE CHANGING

02:00:00.794 --> 02:00:04.864 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

02:00:02.796 --> 02:00:06.499 region:rollup2
AND CERTAINLY COLLEGE HAS

02:00:04.864 --> 02:00:08.535 region:rollup2
CHANGED OVER THE YEARS OF WHO

02:00:06.499 --> 02:00:09.035 region:rollup2
GOES TO COLLEGE WHO CAN GO TO

02:00:08.535 --> 02:00:10.503 region:rollup2
COLLEGE WHO THINKS ABOUT

02:00:09.035 --> 02:00:12.706 region:rollup2
COLLEGE.

02:00:10.503 --> 02:00:14.474 region:rollup2
RIGHT IF WE GO BACK THE

02:00:12.706 --> 02:00:16.276 region:rollup2
BEGINNING OF YOU SEE.

02:00:14.474 --> 02:00:17.977 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT WAS ONLY.

02:00:16.276 --> 02:00:20.480 region:rollup2
I THINK A SPECIAL A SMALL GROUP

02:00:17.977 --> 02:00:22.015 region:rollup2
OF FOLKS WHO COULD AFFORD OR

02:00:20.480 --> 02:00:22.515 region:rollup2
THOUGHT ABOUT GOING TO COLLEGE

02:00:22.015 --> 02:00:24.784 region:rollup2
AND CERTAINLY.

02:00:22.515 --> 02:00:27.887 region:rollup2
THAT IS CHANGE OVER TIME WHERE

02:00:24.784 --> 02:00:28.455 region:rollup2
NOW WE TALK ABOUT ACCESSIBILITY

02:00:27.887 --> 02:00:30.523 region:rollup2
MAKING COLLEGE AFFORDABLE TO

02:00:28.455 --> 02:00:31.691 region:rollup2
ALL.

02:00:30.523 --> 02:00:34.194 region:rollup2
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS THAT COME

02:00:31.691 --> 02:00:35.695 region:rollup2
TO MIND --

02:00:34.194 --> 02:00:37.597 region:rollup2
HOW ARE WE DIFFERENT HOUSES

02:00:35.695 --> 02:00:40.066 region:rollup2
STATE A CALIFORNIA DIFFERENT?

02:00:37.597 --> 02:00:42.168 region:rollup2
FROM SAY AN INSTITUTION LIKE

02:00:40.066 --> 02:00:44.170 region:rollup2
HARVARD OR STANFORD WHO HAS I

02:00:42.168 --> 02:00:45.705 region:rollup2
BELIEVE.

02:00:44.170 --> 02:00:47.841 region:rollup2
NO PROBLEM WITH MONEY.

02:00:45.705 --> 02:00:48.675 region:rollup2
FROM WHAT I'VE READ.

02:00:47.841 --> 02:00:50.543 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT IT'S YOU DIDN'T

02:00:48.675 --> 02:00:53.179 region:rollup2
LIKE STANFORD AND HARVARD HAVE

02:00:50.543 --> 02:00:55.148 region:rollup2
ENOUGH MONEY TO FUND.

02:00:53.179 --> 02:00:57.717 region:rollup2
ALL STUDENTS WHO ATTEND.

02:00:55.148 --> 02:01:00.019 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND SO WE I THINK YOU KNOW

02:00:57.717 --> 02:01:00.653 region:rollup2
I'VE NEVER ATTENDED STANFORD OR

02:01:00.019 --> 02:01:03.623 region:rollup2
HARVARD --

02:01:00.653 --> 02:01:04.224 region:rollup2
BUT THEY'RE ABLE TO FIND.

02:01:03.623 --> 02:01:07.994 region:rollup2
WHATEVER STUDENT COMES THROUGH

02:01:04.224 --> 02:01:10.196 region:rollup2
THEIR DOOR --

02:01:07.994 --> 02:01:11.331 region:rollup2
HOW'RE HOW'RE HOW IS FINANCIAL

02:01:10.196 --> 02:01:15.001 region:rollup2
AID IN CALIFORNIA DIFFERENT FROM

02:01:11.331 --> 02:01:17.837 region:rollup2
THAT -- IT.

02:01:15.001 --> 02:01:20.006 region:rollup2
CAN WE TRY THAT.

02:01:17.837 --> 02:01:23.743 region:rollup2
WELL NOT NOT ALL CALIFORNIA.

02:01:20.006 --> 02:01:25.278 region:rollup2
A PRIVATE STAR LIKE HARVARD AND

02:01:23.743 --> 02:01:27.046 region:rollup2
STANFORD NO OUT OF STATE HOUSING

02:01:25.278 --> 02:01:29.149 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA FINANCIAL AID --

02:01:27.046 --> 02:01:30.283 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WHITWICK WE'RE TRYING

02:01:29.149 --> 02:01:33.253 region:rollup2
TO ALLOW.

02:01:30.283 --> 02:01:35.555 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND TO HAVE AXES TO

02:01:33.253 --> 02:01:36.856 region:rollup2
SEE IT YOU YOU SEE AND PRIORITY

02:01:35.555 --> 02:01:37.423 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

02:01:36.856 --> 02:01:39.793 region:rollup2
AND AND AND IT AT FIRST I I

02:01:37.423 --> 02:01:40.426 region:rollup2
WILL.

02:01:39.793 --> 02:01:43.329 region:rollup2
THOUGHT OF ASKING THE QUESTION

02:01:40.426 --> 02:01:46.032 region:rollup2
ARE BY NUMBERS YOU KNOW --

02:01:43.329 --> 02:01:47.066 region:rollup2
HOW MANY CALIFORNIANS?

02:01:46.032 --> 02:01:48.601 region:rollup2
THE DO WE HAVE A NUMBER REVIEW

02:01:47.066 --> 02:01:49.969 region:rollup2
IF I WROTE DOWN THE NUMBER TWO

02:01:48.601 --> 02:01:51.871 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS IN FINANCIALLY

02:01:49.969 --> 02:01:53.940 region:rollup2
WE AWARD FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:01:51.871 --> 02:01:54.574 region:rollup2
AWARDS.

02:01:53.940 --> 02:01:56.309 region:rollup2
FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIA

02:01:54.574 --> 02:01:58.411 region:rollup2
STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A

02:01:56.309 --> 02:01:59.012 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP WITH THREE HUNDRED

02:01:58.411 --> 02:02:01.214 region:rollup2
FIFTY INSTITUTIONS.

02:01:59.012 --> 02:02:02.682 region:rollup2
THE INSTITUTIONS ARE OVER FIVE

02:02:01.214 --> 02:02:05.318 region:rollup2
SECONDS CSU YOU SEE HOW MANY

02:02:02.682 --> 02:02:07.086 region:rollup2
COLLEGES FOR PROFIT.

02:02:05.318 --> 02:02:07.720 region:rollup2
PRIVATE AND NONPROFIT PRIVATE

02:02:07.086 --> 02:02:11.524 region:rollup2
BUT THEY ALL HAVE TO BE WHAT'S

02:02:07.720 --> 02:02:12.992 region:rollup2
GOOD CREDIT SO AT A PRIVATE.

02:02:11.524 --> 02:02:14.394 region:rollup2
BRANSON'S WHAT'S COMPETITIVE.

02:02:12.992 --> 02:02:15.728 region:rollup2
NONPROFIT A STUDENT CAN RECEIVE

02:02:14.394 --> 02:02:17.997 region:rollup2
ABOUT NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR

02:02:15.728 --> 02:02:20.366 region:rollup2
TUITION AND FEES AS COMPARED TO

02:02:17.997 --> 02:02:20.900 region:rollup2
THE UC OR CSU TUITION AND FEES

02:02:20.366 --> 02:02:22.802 region:rollup2
WHICH IS.

02:02:20.900 --> 02:02:26.339 region:rollup2
WHAT ABOUT ALMOST SIX THOUSAND

02:02:22.802 --> 02:02:26.940 region:rollup2
IT CSU AND ABOUT UP TWELVE

02:02:26.339 --> 02:02:28.408 region:rollup2
THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED THIRTY OR

02:02:26.940 --> 02:02:31.344 region:rollup2
SO I THINK SIXTY DOLLARS LESS --

02:02:28.408 --> 02:02:33.446 region:rollup2
AT UC. FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:02:31.344 --> 02:02:34.347 region:rollup2
STUDENTS YES AND I WROTE DOWN

02:02:33.446 --> 02:02:36.583 region:rollup2
58% OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE

02:02:34.347 --> 02:02:37.584 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

02:02:36.583 --> 02:02:40.186 region:rollup2
DID I HEAR THAT YOU KNOW HOW

02:02:37.584 --> 02:02:43.489 region:rollup2
THAT THAT NUMBER AND GET TUITION

02:02:40.186 --> 02:02:44.224 region:rollup2
AND DON'T PAY THEIR EDUCATION.

02:02:43.489 --> 02:02:46.960 region:rollup2
FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND IN FACT

02:02:44.224 --> 02:02:48.728 region:rollup2
HAVE 50% FIFTY EIGHT A LITTLE

02:02:46.960 --> 02:02:49.929 region:rollup2
BIT MORE THAN THAT IN UNIT REYES

02:02:48.728 --> 02:02:51.331 region:rollup2
THAT STILL I DON'T PAY ANYTHING

02:02:49.929 --> 02:02:53.299 region:rollup2
IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHAT WOULD

02:02:51.331 --> 02:02:54.701 region:rollup2
IT WHAT IS THE PERCENTAGE OF C

02:02:53.299 --> 02:02:55.435 region:rollup2
AND CSU STUDENTS.

02:02:54.701 --> 02:02:57.070 region:rollup2
THAT --

02:02:55.435 --> 02:03:00.039 region:rollup2
RECEIVED FINANCIALLY.

02:02:57.070 --> 02:03:04.544 region:rollup2
HIGHER SO 67% THAT'S THE ISSUE

02:03:00.039 --> 02:03:06.045 region:rollup2
AND 66% AT UC SIXTY SEVEN SIXTY

02:03:04.544 --> 02:03:08.848 region:rollup2
SIX HAVE SOME FINANCIALLY.

02:03:06.045 --> 02:03:10.049 region:rollup2
YES AM EVEN NOT YOU'VE SEEN THE

02:03:08.848 --> 02:03:11.551 region:rollup2
WAY BECAUSE I AM.

02:03:10.049 --> 02:03:13.386 region:rollup2
SYPHAC HERE HAS BEEN TALKING

02:03:11.551 --> 02:03:15.088 region:rollup2
ABOUT CAL GRANT PROGRAMS SO

02:03:13.386 --> 02:03:16.956 region:rollup2
THERE'S TWO BILLION FOR CAL

02:03:15.088 --> 02:03:17.824 region:rollup2
GRANTS THERE'S ANOTHER TO SOME

02:03:16.956 --> 02:03:19.559 region:rollup2
BILLION.

02:03:17.824 --> 02:03:21.227 region:rollup2
IN TUITION REVENUE AT THE

02:03:19.559 --> 02:03:23.463 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY'S THAT'S BEING

02:03:21.227 --> 02:03:24.130 region:rollup2
REDIRECTED AND AID AND THEN

02:03:23.463 --> 02:03:24.831 region:rollup2
THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF FEDERAL

02:03:24.130 --> 02:03:26.699 region:rollup2
MONEY.

02:03:24.831 --> 02:03:28.268 region:rollup2
SO WHEN YOU TALK TO YOU SEE FOR

02:03:26.699 --> 02:03:30.470 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE THEY HAVE A PARTICULAR

02:03:28.268 --> 02:03:31.604 region:rollup2
EIGHT MODEL THAT SAYS IF.

02:03:30.470 --> 02:03:34.073 region:rollup2
WHATEVER YOUR FAMILY CAN

02:03:31.604 --> 02:03:36.476 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTE LET'S HARLEM ACTUALLY

02:03:34.073 --> 02:03:38.411 region:rollup2
THEY THEY SET THIS UNIFORM WORK.

02:03:36.476 --> 02:03:40.113 region:rollup2
LOAN EXPECTATION AND THEN THEY

02:03:38.411 --> 02:03:41.514 region:rollup2
COVER THE RESIDUAL UP TO THE

02:03:40.113 --> 02:03:44.384 region:rollup2
COST OF ATTENDANCE AT THE COST

02:03:41.514 --> 02:03:45.018 region:rollup2
OF ATTENDANCE AT BERKELEY AS

02:03:44.384 --> 02:03:47.053 region:rollup2
TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND AND THEY

02:03:45.018 --> 02:03:48.388 region:rollup2
EXPECT EVERYBODY THROUGH MARK IN

02:03:47.053 --> 02:03:49.389 region:rollup2
LOANS TO DO.

02:03:48.388 --> 02:03:50.356 region:rollup2
EIGHT THOUSAND LET'S SAY I THINK

02:03:49.389 --> 02:03:52.125 region:rollup2
IT'S A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THE

02:03:50.356 --> 02:03:53.159 region:rollup2
STATE'S LET'S MAKE IT TEN

02:03:52.125 --> 02:03:53.993 region:rollup2
THOUSAND THEY WILL.

02:03:53.159 --> 02:03:55.828 region:rollup2
I COME UP WITH THAT EIGHT

02:03:53.993 --> 02:03:57.497 region:rollup2
REMAINING EIGHTEEN THOUSAND SO

02:03:55.828 --> 02:03:59.799 region:rollup2
THAT THE STUDENT CAN IN THERE OF

02:03:57.497 --> 02:04:01.100 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE RECENTLY MANAGE

02:03:59.799 --> 02:04:02.402 region:rollup2
BILLY IT'S HAPPENED.

02:04:01.100 --> 02:04:04.170 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET

02:04:02.402 --> 02:04:04.804 region:rollup2
AT IS THAT SOME WHAT THE

02:04:04.170 --> 02:04:08.007 region:rollup2
QUESTION THE DOCTOR WEBER PASSED

02:04:04.804 --> 02:04:09.208 region:rollup2
--

02:04:08.007 --> 02:04:10.543 region:rollup2
AND IT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION

02:04:09.208 --> 02:04:11.644 region:rollup2
TO ME I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT OF

02:04:10.543 --> 02:04:12.879 region:rollup2
STUDENT --

02:04:11.644 --> 02:04:15.682 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL AID AS MAKING A

02:04:12.879 --> 02:04:18.318 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE STUDENT

02:04:15.682 --> 02:04:19.252 region:rollup2
WHO COULD ATTEND AND NOT ATTEND.

02:04:18.318 --> 02:04:21.587 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S HOW I THOUGHT OF IT

02:04:19.252 --> 02:04:22.221 region:rollup2
OR HOW I THINK OF IT.

02:04:21.587 --> 02:04:23.323 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT WITHOUT FINANCIAL

02:04:22.221 --> 02:04:24.791 region:rollup2
AID.

02:04:23.323 --> 02:04:26.759 region:rollup2
X. NUMBERS STUDENTS WOULD NOT BE

02:04:24.791 --> 02:04:27.860 region:rollup2
ABLE TO ATTEND.

02:04:26.759 --> 02:04:29.529 region:rollup2
YOU SEE SERIOUS.

02:04:27.860 --> 02:04:31.397 region:rollup2
OR COMMUNITY COLLEGE --

02:04:29.529 --> 02:04:32.565 region:rollup2
THAT IS CORRECT [inaudible]

02:04:31.397 --> 02:04:37.704 region:rollup2
SO BY.

02:04:32.565 --> 02:04:39.339 region:rollup2
BUT BUT BUT IS --

02:04:37.704 --> 02:04:40.873 region:rollup2
SYSTEM A DIFFERENT SYSTEM IS

02:04:39.339 --> 02:04:42.442 region:rollup2
THAT IT IS VERY DIFFERENT SYSTEM

02:04:40.873 --> 02:04:44.377 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD ALLOW --

02:04:42.442 --> 02:04:45.345 region:rollup2
ACCESSIBILITY TO ALL THESE

02:04:44.377 --> 02:04:47.847 region:rollup2
NUMBERED THESE FOUR HUNDRED

02:04:45.345 --> 02:04:49.315 region:rollup2
THOUSAND STUDENTS --

02:04:47.847 --> 02:04:51.985 region:rollup2
TO TO ATTEND COLLEGE.

02:04:49.315 --> 02:04:54.320 region:rollup2
BUT WITHOUT FINANCIALLY.

02:04:51.985 --> 02:04:55.888 region:rollup2
OUR MAN I KNOW I AM NOT AWARE OF

02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:57.790 region:rollup2
ANYTHING THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM

02:04:55.888 --> 02:04:59.592 region:rollup2
TO ATTEND WITHOUT FINANCIAL AID

02:04:57.790 --> 02:05:01.361 region:rollup2
A AT LEAST EQUALITY --

02:04:59.592 --> 02:05:01.994 region:rollup2
ENOUGH INSTITUTION OUT THERE ARE

02:05:01.361 --> 02:05:04.230 region:rollup2
MANY MOVING PARTS OF ALL OF THIS

02:05:01.994 --> 02:05:06.065 region:rollup2
--

02:05:04.230 --> 02:05:08.167 region:rollup2
YOU CAN HAVE A VERY LOW QUALITY

02:05:06.065 --> 02:05:09.702 region:rollup2
INSTITUTION WITHOUT A LOT OF

02:05:08.167 --> 02:05:12.105 region:rollup2
TEACHER STUDENT INTERACTION I

02:05:09.702 --> 02:05:15.074 region:rollup2
SUPPOSE AND A BUT IF YOU'RE

02:05:12.105 --> 02:05:17.710 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT ACCESS. TO QUALITY

02:05:15.074 --> 02:05:19.445 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS OF THE MONEY EITHER

02:05:17.710 --> 02:05:20.980 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO CALM THE MONEY FOR THE

02:05:19.445 --> 02:05:22.215 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS OF THE INSTITUTION

02:05:20.980 --> 02:05:24.150 region:rollup2
EITHER NEEDS TO COME FROM THE

02:05:22.215 --> 02:05:25.551 region:rollup2
STATE OR FROM TUITION AND IF A

02:05:24.150 --> 02:05:27.186 region:rollup2
STUDENT CAN'T AFFORD IT THAT THE

02:05:25.551 --> 02:05:28.454 region:rollup2
TUITION.

02:05:27.186 --> 02:05:31.290 region:rollup2
THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE.

02:05:28.454 --> 02:05:32.658 region:rollup2
TO GO YOU ALSO NEED TO GUY

02:05:31.290 --> 02:05:35.561 region:rollup2
CONSIDER THE STUDENTS ADDITIONAL

02:05:32.658 --> 02:05:37.063 region:rollup2
COSTS SO THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY

02:05:35.561 --> 02:05:38.798 region:rollup2
ENGAGE IN --

02:05:37.063 --> 02:05:40.867 region:rollup2
AND FOCUS ON THEIR THEIR

02:05:38.798 --> 02:05:42.435 region:rollup2
EDUCATION AND NOT BE PULLED AWAY

02:05:40.867 --> 02:05:44.537 region:rollup2
BY WORK OR FAMILY

02:05:42.435 --> 02:05:48.174 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITIES SO THAT IT CAN

02:05:44.537 --> 02:05:50.710 region:rollup2
BE EFFECTIVE AND IN THAT WAY --

02:05:48.174 --> 02:05:52.879 region:rollup2
THAT THE STANFORD'S IN HARVARD'S

02:05:50.710 --> 02:05:54.981 region:rollup2
ARE ABLE TO MANAGE --

02:05:52.879 --> 02:05:58.551 region:rollup2
WITH -- WITH

02:05:54.981 --> 02:06:00.787 region:rollup2
JEWISH AND BECAUSE THEY ARE

02:05:58.551 --> 02:06:06.759 region:rollup2
SELECTIVE IN THEIR ADMISSIONS

02:06:00.787 --> 02:06:10.063 region:rollup2
AND THERE THE THE CRITERIA THEY

02:06:06.759 --> 02:06:11.264 region:rollup2
USE -- FOR

02:06:10.063 --> 02:06:13.766 region:rollup2
FOR ACCEPTING PEOPLE TO THE

02:06:11.264 --> 02:06:14.600 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITIES ARE HEAVILY SKEWED

02:06:13.766 --> 02:06:17.437 region:rollup2
TOWARD --

02:06:14.600 --> 02:06:20.573 region:rollup2
HIGH INCOME FAMILIES SO A TH

02:06:17.437 --> 02:06:23.843 region:rollup2
PROBABLY A THIRD OR MORE OF THE

02:06:20.573 --> 02:06:25.044 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO ATTEND A STE THE

02:06:23.843 --> 02:06:27.346 region:rollup2
SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLAR HARVARD OR

02:06:25.044 --> 02:06:28.681 region:rollup2
STANFORD ARE PAYING FULL COST

02:06:27.346 --> 02:06:29.582 region:rollup2
WITHOUT EVEN BOTHERING TO APPLY

02:06:28.681 --> 02:06:31.918 region:rollup2
FOR FINANCIAL AID BECAUSE THEY

02:06:29.582 --> 02:06:34.420 region:rollup2
HAVE.

02:06:31.918 --> 02:06:37.790 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE A LOT OF MONEY --

02:06:34.420 --> 02:06:40.193 region:rollup2
AND AND SO THAT SO YOU KNOW --

02:06:37.790 --> 02:06:42.695 region:rollup2
PELL GRANT RECIPIENTS AT A

02:06:40.193 --> 02:06:43.863 region:rollup2
HARVARD MAYBE TWELVE OR SO AT

02:06:42.695 --> 02:06:46.799 region:rollup2
STANFORD --

02:06:43.863 --> 02:06:48.334 region:rollup2
AND 30% PLUS AT UNIVERSITY OF

02:06:46.799 --> 02:06:50.269 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

02:06:48.334 --> 02:06:52.271 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES AND EVEN HIGHER THAN

02:06:50.269 --> 02:06:52.805 region:rollup2
THAT AT AT CSU AND SOME

02:06:52.271 --> 02:06:55.608 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGES BUT THE

02:06:52.805 --> 02:06:57.510 region:rollup2
COUNTER ARGUMENT I SUPPOSE IS

02:06:55.608 --> 02:06:58.077 region:rollup2
THAT THE AND I'VE.

02:06:57.510 --> 02:06:58.377 region:rollup2
SEEN THE BOOKS WRITTEN RIGHT

02:06:58.077 --> 02:07:00.213 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

02:06:58.377 --> 02:07:01.981 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:07:00.213 --> 02:07:02.882 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA OR THE THE WHOLE

02:07:01.981 --> 02:07:04.383 region:rollup2
COUNTRY COULD.

02:07:02.882 --> 02:07:06.752 region:rollup2
OFFER FREE.

02:07:04.383 --> 02:07:08.154 region:rollup2
COLLEGE THAT IT HAS THE MEANS

02:07:06.752 --> 02:07:10.723 region:rollup2
BUT THAT WOULD --

02:07:08.154 --> 02:07:11.557 region:rollup2
ENTAILED SUB TYPE OF VERY AS WE

02:07:10.723 --> 02:07:14.927 region:rollup2
SAID -- HIGH

02:07:11.557 --> 02:07:16.128 region:rollup2
LEVELS OF OF SUPPORT IT WOULD BE

02:07:14.927 --> 02:07:17.964 region:rollup2
A HIGH LEVEL OF INVESTMENT TO

02:07:16.128 --> 02:07:18.831 region:rollup2
ANY OF THE PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS

02:07:17.964 --> 02:07:20.199 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE.

02:07:18.831 --> 02:07:21.534 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE TUITION AND FEES

02:07:20.199 --> 02:07:23.269 region:rollup2
THAT'S REQUIRED WHAT'S NOT

02:07:21.534 --> 02:07:25.838 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTED FOR AS LIVING EXPENSES

02:07:23.269 --> 02:07:29.208 region:rollup2
WHICH IS OFTEN TIMES MORE THAN.

02:07:25.838 --> 02:07:29.742 region:rollup2
A TUITION AT YOU SEE SO OFTEN

02:07:29.208 --> 02:07:30.543 region:rollup2
TWELVE TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND

02:07:29.742 --> 02:07:32.512 region:rollup2
DOLLARS LET ME DEPENDS ON WHERE

02:07:30.543 --> 02:07:33.679 region:rollup2
YOU LIVE IN THE STATE BUT THAT

02:07:32.512 --> 02:07:34.947 region:rollup2
IS WHAT YOU'LL HEAR FROM TODAY I

02:07:33.679 --> 02:07:36.415 region:rollup2
THINK A PUBLIC COMMENT FROM THE

02:07:34.947 --> 02:07:38.417 region:rollup2
STUDENTS THAT'S WERE VERY

02:07:36.415 --> 02:07:40.520 region:rollup2
GENEROUS FINANCIAL AID --

02:07:38.417 --> 02:07:42.655 region:rollup2
STATE BUT THE COST OF LIVING

02:07:40.520 --> 02:07:44.090 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION AND HOUSING IS SO

02:07:42.655 --> 02:07:46.626 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE HERE THAT THEY'RE

02:07:44.090 --> 02:07:48.160 region:rollup2
HAVING TO WORK TWO TO THREE JOBS

02:07:46.626 --> 02:07:49.729 region:rollup2
AND IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH AND AS

02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:50.963 region:rollup2
EVIDENCED BY REALLY THE TH.

02:07:49.729 --> 02:07:52.932 region:rollup2
THE COMPLETION OF DEGREE

02:07:50.963 --> 02:07:54.267 region:rollup2
COMPLETION YOU'RE SEEING THE

02:07:52.932 --> 02:07:55.434 region:rollup2
EFFECTS OF THAT IN ADDITION TO

02:07:54.267 --> 02:07:57.069 region:rollup2
OTHER STUDENTS SUPPORT THAT ARE

02:07:55.434 --> 02:07:59.872 region:rollup2
NECESSARY REQUIRED BUT NO THAT'S

02:07:57.069 --> 02:08:01.474 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTE TRUE YOU COULD PROVIDE.

02:07:59.872 --> 02:08:03.242 region:rollup2
ALL THE HIGHER ED INSTITUTIONS

02:08:01.474 --> 02:08:05.177 region:rollup2
WITH ENOUGH TUITION TO COVER

02:08:03.242 --> 02:08:07.113 region:rollup2
STUDENTS THAT NEED IT YOU WOULD

02:08:05.177 --> 02:08:09.048 region:rollup2
STILL NEED THE COVER LIVING

02:08:07.113 --> 02:08:10.917 region:rollup2
EXPENSES FOR THE ASTUTE.

02:08:09.048 --> 02:08:12.351 region:rollup2
ADMIT THINK THERE ARE TWO ISSUES

02:08:10.917 --> 02:08:13.352 region:rollup2
THAT ARE INTERTWINED AND IT

02:08:12.351 --> 02:08:15.555 region:rollup2
MIGHT HELP TO TAKE THEM

02:08:13.352 --> 02:08:17.190 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALLY SO ONE IS JUST HOW

02:08:15.555 --> 02:08:18.524 region:rollup2
MUCH MONEY TO PUT IN THE SYSTEM.

02:08:17.190 --> 02:08:20.059 region:rollup2
AND I THINK AT THIS POINT THE

02:08:18.524 --> 02:08:21.127 region:rollup2
WAY THAT THE NATION IS WORKING

02:08:20.059 --> 02:08:22.528 region:rollup2
WHETHER AT STANFORD OR

02:08:21.127 --> 02:08:24.497 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

02:08:22.528 --> 02:08:26.265 region:rollup2
THERE HAS BEEN AN ARRANGEMENT

02:08:24.497 --> 02:08:28.200 region:rollup2
THAT THOSE WHO PAY WILL PAY AND

02:08:26.265 --> 02:08:29.468 region:rollup2
NOT THOSE WHO CAN'T THE STATE

02:08:28.200 --> 02:08:30.636 region:rollup2
WILL MAKE IT WHETHER AT STANFORD

02:08:29.468 --> 02:08:31.504 region:rollup2
ARE THE STATE WERE TRYING TO

02:08:30.636 --> 02:08:32.605 region:rollup2
COVER.

02:08:31.504 --> 02:08:34.440 region:rollup2
AID FOR FINANCIALLY NEEDY

02:08:32.605 --> 02:08:36.509 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WHO WENT OTHERWISE BE

02:08:34.440 --> 02:08:38.511 region:rollup2
ABLE TO ATTEND SO THAT'S A BASIC

02:08:36.509 --> 02:08:40.680 region:rollup2
TRADEOFF WE CAN CHARGE HIGHER

02:08:38.511 --> 02:08:42.548 region:rollup2
INCOME FOLKS LESS BUT IT WILL

02:08:40.680 --> 02:08:43.649 region:rollup2
MEAN EFFECTIVELY DOLLAR FOR

02:08:42.548 --> 02:08:44.951 region:rollup2
DOLLAR LESS THAT GOES TO

02:08:43.649 --> 02:08:45.851 region:rollup2
FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS

02:08:44.951 --> 02:08:47.553 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT WOULD BE FOR THEIR

02:08:45.851 --> 02:08:47.787 region:rollup2
LIVING COSTS THEIR TUITION COSTS

02:08:47.553 --> 02:08:49.522 region:rollup2
TO GET.

02:08:47.787 --> 02:08:51.524 region:rollup2
THEM IN THE DOOR TO KEEP THEM

02:08:49.522 --> 02:08:53.226 region:rollup2
THEIR FOURTH YEAR IT'S IN A JUST

02:08:51.524 --> 02:08:54.994 region:rollup2
ON A MEDIA TRADE OFF AND THAT

02:08:53.226 --> 02:08:56.696 region:rollup2
NOTS YOUR CONSIDERATION DO YOU

02:08:54.994 --> 02:08:58.564 region:rollup2
WANT TO ACTION VERY LOW SO THAT

02:08:56.696 --> 02:08:59.799 region:rollup2
YOU HELP ALL STUDENTS OF EVERY

02:08:58.564 --> 02:09:00.600 region:rollup2
INCOME LEVEL OR DO YOU WANT TO

02:08:59.799 --> 02:09:02.335 region:rollup2
TARGET.

02:09:00.600 --> 02:09:03.669 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE BIG DECISION YOU FACE

02:09:02.335 --> 02:09:04.804 region:rollup2
EVERY YEAR.

02:09:03.669 --> 02:09:06.539 region:rollup2
THE SECOND ISSUE THOUGH THAT I

02:09:04.804 --> 02:09:07.740 region:rollup2
THINK IS GETTING WRAPPED UP INTO

02:09:06.539 --> 02:09:08.641 region:rollup2
THE CONVERSATION IS JUST WHAT

02:09:07.740 --> 02:09:09.809 region:rollup2
DOES THAT NEED TO BE THIS

02:09:08.641 --> 02:09:12.678 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED.

02:09:09.809 --> 02:09:14.180 region:rollup2
IF IN REALITY IT'S FREE FOR HALF

02:09:12.678 --> 02:09:15.481 region:rollup2
OF THE STUDENTS TO GO TO COLLEGE

02:09:14.180 --> 02:09:17.049 region:rollup2
WHY ISN'T THE MESSAGE BEING

02:09:15.481 --> 02:09:19.252 region:rollup2
CONVEYED TO THEM SO YOU LOOK AT

02:09:17.049 --> 02:09:21.387 region:rollup2
THE DATA AND REGARDLESS OF THE

02:09:19.252 --> 02:09:22.388 region:rollup2
SEGMENT.

02:09:21.387 --> 02:09:24.523 region:rollup2
IT IS NOTE IN.

02:09:22.388 --> 02:09:26.092 region:rollup2
VIRTUALLY NO CHARGE FOR MANY

02:09:24.523 --> 02:09:27.326 region:rollup2
STUDENTS AT ALL OF THE SEGMENTS

02:09:26.092 --> 02:09:28.928 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU SEE SOME OF THAT NOT

02:09:27.326 --> 02:09:30.730 region:rollup2
PRICES THAT CAN BE COVERED BY

02:09:28.928 --> 02:09:31.964 region:rollup2
WORKING TWENTY HOURS A WEEK

02:09:30.730 --> 02:09:34.033 region:rollup2
DURING THE ACADEMIC YEAR SO NO

02:09:31.964 --> 02:09:35.434 region:rollup2
KNOWN AS REQUIRED IN EVERY OTHER

02:09:34.033 --> 02:09:37.270 region:rollup2
COST DISCOVERED.

02:09:35.434 --> 02:09:39.505 region:rollup2
FOOD HOUSING TUITION IT'S ALL

02:09:37.270 --> 02:09:40.840 region:rollup2
COVERED I THINK WHAT WE'VE EACH

02:09:39.505 --> 02:09:42.541 region:rollup2
BEEN TRYING TO SAY AND DIFFERENT

02:09:40.840 --> 02:09:43.676 region:rollup2
WORDS IS THAT THIS CALIFORNIA

02:09:42.541 --> 02:09:44.910 region:rollup2
SYSTEM DOES NOT NEED TO BE THIS

02:09:43.676 --> 02:09:46.045 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED.

02:09:44.910 --> 02:09:47.380 region:rollup2
SO THAT THAT MESSAGE ISN'T

02:09:46.045 --> 02:09:48.681 region:rollup2
GETTING RECEIVED IF THAT'S

02:09:47.380 --> 02:09:49.882 region:rollup2
WHAT'S HAPPENING ROOM REALITY

02:09:48.681 --> 02:09:51.651 region:rollup2
WHY DON'T WE MAKE IT CLEAR TO

02:09:49.882 --> 02:09:53.786 region:rollup2
STUDENTS THAT THAT IS INDEED THE

02:09:51.651 --> 02:09:56.022 region:rollup2
WAY CALIFORNIA WORKS. TO MAKE

02:09:53.786 --> 02:09:57.356 region:rollup2
THAT HAPPEN WOULD REQUIRE AN

02:09:56.022 --> 02:09:59.058 region:rollup2
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW A STUDENT HAS

02:09:57.356 --> 02:10:00.126 region:rollup2
TO KNOW THAT THEY CAN QUALIFY

02:09:59.058 --> 02:10:01.727 region:rollup2
FOR TUITION ASSISTANCE THROUGH

02:10:00.126 --> 02:10:03.329 region:rollup2
THAT PROGRAM DEPENDING ON IF

02:10:01.727 --> 02:10:04.797 region:rollup2
THEY KNOW THEIR GPA THEIR FAMILY

02:10:03.329 --> 02:10:05.464 region:rollup2
INCOME THEIR ASSETS THEIR AGE

02:10:04.797 --> 02:10:06.399 region:rollup2
AND HOW LONG THEY'VE BEEN OUT OF

02:10:05.464 --> 02:10:08.367 region:rollup2
COLLEGE.

02:10:06.399 --> 02:10:10.736 region:rollup2
AND THEN THEY MIGHT KNOW THAT UC

02:10:08.367 --> 02:10:11.904 region:rollup2
AND CSU PROVIDES THEM SOME OTHER

02:10:10.736 --> 02:10:13.472 region:rollup2
ARRANGEMENT OR IF THEY SLIP

02:10:11.904 --> 02:10:14.974 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE CRACKS YES YOU WILL

02:10:13.472 --> 02:10:16.676 region:rollup2
BACK PHILIP FOR THEM.

02:10:14.974 --> 02:10:18.044 region:rollup2
AND IT'S JUST GETS OVERWHELMING

02:10:16.676 --> 02:10:19.412 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A HARD TIME FIGURING IT

02:10:18.044 --> 02:10:21.714 region:rollup2
OUT AS OUR JOB TO DO IT STUDENTS

02:10:19.412 --> 02:10:23.516 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO

02:10:21.714 --> 02:10:24.550 region:rollup2
NAVIGATE IN SOME INSTANCES --

02:10:23.516 --> 02:10:26.018 region:rollup2
BUT THAT WOULD REQUIRE LET'S

02:10:24.550 --> 02:10:27.453 region:rollup2
HAVE ONE PROGRAM CALL THE CAL

02:10:26.018 --> 02:10:29.388 region:rollup2
GRANT PROGRAM THAT'S NOT HAVE

02:10:27.453 --> 02:10:30.790 region:rollup2
SIX DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND LET'S

02:10:29.388 --> 02:10:32.024 region:rollup2
MAKE IT CLEAR THAT HE THERE WILL

02:10:30.790 --> 02:10:33.426 region:rollup2
BE AN EXPECTATION YOU MIGHT HAVE

02:10:32.024 --> 02:10:34.360 region:rollup2
TO WORK MAYBE TWENTY HOURS A

02:10:33.426 --> 02:10:35.428 region:rollup2
WEEK BUT EVERYTHING ELSE IS

02:10:34.360 --> 02:10:36.362 region:rollup2
COVERED.

02:10:35.428 --> 02:10:37.630 region:rollup2
BUT THEN MAYBE WE NEED SIMPLER

02:10:36.362 --> 02:10:39.231 region:rollup2
RULES LIKE HEY IF YOUR FAMILY

02:10:37.630 --> 02:10:40.066 region:rollup2
INCOME IS LESS THAN A HUNDRED

02:10:39.231 --> 02:10:40.866 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS WILL COVER IT

02:10:40.066 --> 02:10:42.234 region:rollup2
BECAUSE MAYBE THEY DON'T GET THE

02:10:40.866 --> 02:10:43.602 region:rollup2
FACT THAT RULES AND THEY DON'T

02:10:42.234 --> 02:10:45.371 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND EXPECTED FAMILY

02:10:43.602 --> 02:10:46.839 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTION --

02:10:45.371 --> 02:10:49.408 region:rollup2
BUT AGAIN THAT'S THAT'S SORT OF

02:10:46.839 --> 02:10:52.311 region:rollup2
SEPARATE ISSUE ABOUT HOW WE

02:10:49.408 --> 02:10:52.611 region:rollup2
CONVEY WHAT THE STATE PROVIDES

02:10:52.311 --> 02:10:57.683 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

02:10:52.611 --> 02:10:59.285 region:rollup2
TO THANK YOU.

02:10:57.683 --> 02:11:00.352 region:rollup2
THANK YOU --

02:10:59.285 --> 02:11:00.853 region:rollup2
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

02:11:00.352 --> 02:11:02.221 region:rollup2
THAT THE COUPLE WHO ARE

02:11:00.853 --> 02:11:04.156 region:rollup2
MENTIONED THAT'S CHANGED LOTS

02:11:02.221 --> 02:11:05.391 region:rollup2
SINCE --

02:11:04.156 --> 02:11:06.792 region:rollup2
NINETEEN SIXTY IS BEST SUITED

02:11:05.391 --> 02:11:08.360 region:rollup2
POPULATION IN THE DIVERSITY OF

NECESSARY AND TECHNOLOGY IS

02:11:16.836 --> 02:11:20.606 region:rollup2

THERE HOW SHOULD OUR FINANCIAL

NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS LET'S

02:11:31.784 --> 02:11:35.654 region:rollup2
SAY -- AND

02:11:34.320 --> 02:11:36.555 region:rollup2

INHIBIT THEIR ABILITY TO COME

02:11:37.957 --> 02:11:40.126 region:rollup2
BACK TO COLLEGE.

02:11:39.225 --> 02:11:41.227 region:rollup2
THERE ARE --

02:11:40.126 --> 02:11:42.995 region:rollup2
QUITE A FEW RULES --

02:11:41.227 --> 02:11:44.096 region:rollup2
IF YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE A STUDENT

02:11:42.995 --> 02:11:44.764 region:rollup2
EVEN --

02:11:44.096 --> 02:11:46.799 region:rollup2
ENTITLEMENTS CHEN COMING OUT OF

02:11:44.764 --> 02:11:47.400 region:rollup2
HIGH SCHOOL AND YOU HAVE AT

02:11:46.799 --> 02:11:48.467 region:rollup2
LEAST A TWO POINT NO YOU'RE IN

02:11:47.400 --> 02:11:50.035 region:rollup2
PRETTY GOOD.

02:11:48.467 --> 02:11:50.970 region:rollup2
SHAPE -- IF

02:11:50.035 --> 02:11:51.971 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE A THREE POINT OWN

02:11:50.970 --> 02:11:53.072 region:rollup2
MAKING MORE MONEY OR EVEN BETTER

02:11:51.971 --> 02:11:55.341 region:rollup2
SHAPE.

02:11:53.072 --> 02:11:56.809 region:rollup2
BUT PERSON THAT'S ABOUT TWENTY

02:11:55.341 --> 02:11:58.110 region:rollup2
EIGHT YOU KNOW BEYOND.

02:11:56.809 --> 02:11:59.345 region:rollup2
TWENTY EIGHT AND YOU OF BEEN OUT

ON THAT COMPETITIVE LIST WHICH

02:12:00.379 --> 02:12:02.715 region:rollup2
IS THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND

02:12:02.181 --> 02:12:05.651 region:rollup2
STUDENTS STRONG.

02:12:02.715 --> 02:12:06.185 region:rollup2
AND I ONLY HAVE --

02:12:05.651 --> 02:12:07.686 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SEVEN

02:12:06.185 --> 02:12:10.022 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AWARDS THAT THAT AWARD

02:12:07.686 --> 02:12:12.525 region:rollup2
IS WORTH SIXTEEN SEVENTY TWO FOR

02:12:10.022 --> 02:12:13.926 region:rollup2
A FULL TIME STUDENT FOR THE YEAR

02:12:12.525 --> 02:12:15.895 region:rollup2
NOW IT'S SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH FOR

02:12:13.926 --> 02:12:17.897 region:rollup2
US A STUDENT THAT GENERALLY HAVE

02:12:15.895 --> 02:12:19.365 region:rollup2
THE FAMILY --

02:12:17.897 --> 02:12:20.800 region:rollup2
AND SO --

02:12:19.365 --> 02:12:21.767 region:rollup2
YOU WOULDN'T REALLY NEED TO NOT

02:12:20.800 --> 02:12:22.301 region:rollup2
ONLY SUPPORT MORE OF THE

02:12:21.767 --> 02:12:23.169 region:rollup2
STUDENTS BUT ALSO NEED TO

02:12:22.301 --> 02:12:24.904 region:rollup2
SUPPORT.

02:12:23.169 --> 02:12:26.138 region:rollup2
MORE OF THAT SORT OF AID TO

02:12:24.904 --> 02:12:27.239 region:rollup2
THOSE STUDENTS AND MAYBE

02:12:26.138 --> 02:12:28.774 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO THOSE

02:12:27.239 --> 02:12:29.742 region:rollup2
SINCE THAT MAY NOT BE IN THE

02:12:28.774 --> 02:12:31.444 region:rollup2
FORM OF LIVING EXPENSES BUT

02:12:29.742 --> 02:12:33.779 region:rollup2
MAYBE OTHER TYPES OF SUPPORT

02:12:31.444 --> 02:12:34.814 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM. TO TO BE

02:12:33.779 --> 02:12:35.414 region:rollup2
ABLE -- TO

02:12:34.814 --> 02:12:37.249 region:rollup2
GET THROUGH YOU KNOW FASTER SO

02:12:35.414 --> 02:12:39.218 region:rollup2
--

02:12:37.249 --> 02:12:40.753 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY I THINK THEY'RE IN

02:12:39.218 --> 02:12:42.488 region:rollup2
OUR CAL GRANT SYSTEM THERE ARE.

02:12:40.753 --> 02:12:43.923 region:rollup2
DEFINITE AGE YOU KNOW OUR

02:12:42.488 --> 02:12:44.890 region:rollup2
LIMITATIONS TRANSFER

02:12:43.923 --> 02:12:47.059 region:rollup2
ENTITLEMENTS TINT BICU CAN'T

02:12:44.890 --> 02:12:48.127 region:rollup2
COPY OF BE IT YOU CAN'T EVEN IF

02:12:47.059 --> 02:12:50.529 region:rollup2
IT IS A MOTIVATED STUDENTS HAS

02:12:48.127 --> 02:12:51.864 region:rollup2
BEEN IN THE SYSTEM PUBLIC TWO TO

02:12:50.529 --> 02:12:52.832 region:rollup2
FOUR YEARS TRYING TO TRANSFER.

02:12:51.864 --> 02:12:53.899 region:rollup2
IF YOU'RE BEYOND TWENTY EIGHT

02:12:52.832 --> 02:12:55.000 region:rollup2
LINK YOU MADE OTHER CHOICES

02:12:53.899 --> 02:12:56.635 region:rollup2
EARLIER ON YOU DON'T GET THAT

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.436 region:rollup2
TRANSFER ENTITLEMENT.

02:12:56.635 --> 02:12:59.004 region:rollup2
SO YOU'RE OUT THOSE SORT OF

02:12:57.436 --> 02:13:00.139 region:rollup2
WOMEN THE FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITY

02:12:59.004 --> 02:13:01.040 region:rollup2
WHATEVER THEY MIGHT HAVE FOR YOU

02:13:00.139 --> 02:13:03.342 region:rollup2
AT THE TIME AND IF YOU'VE

02:13:01.040 --> 02:13:04.810 region:rollup2
EXHAUSTED YOUR EIGHT THEN. TOO

02:13:03.342 --> 02:13:06.846 region:rollup2
BAD MEAN ALSO SO THERE ARE

02:13:04.810 --> 02:13:08.380 region:rollup2
DEFINITELY THINGS THAT WE CAN DO

02:13:06.846 --> 02:13:09.949 region:rollup2
FOR STUDENTS I MENTIONED EARLIER

02:13:08.380 --> 02:13:10.916 region:rollup2
CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION

02:13:09.949 --> 02:13:12.284 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

02:13:10.916 --> 02:13:14.220 region:rollup2
KNOW THERE'S A WE HAVE ABOUT

02:13:12.284 --> 02:13:15.754 region:rollup2
EIGHT THOUSAND VOTES.

02:13:14.220 --> 02:13:16.622 region:rollup2
IT I THINK SIXTY THOUSAND AWARDS

02:13:15.754 --> 02:13:18.891 region:rollup2
AND I'M NOT REMEMBERING THAT

02:13:16.622 --> 02:13:19.458 region:rollup2
CORRECTLY TWO THOUSAND WORDS GO

02:13:18.891 --> 02:13:23.562 region:rollup2
ON USED.

02:13:19.458 --> 02:13:24.697 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE --

02:13:23.562 --> 02:13:27.166 region:rollup2
WHETHER THEY'RE ON A PARTICULAR

02:13:24.697 --> 02:13:28.400 region:rollup2
PATHWAY AND THEY NEED TO PROVIDE

02:13:27.166 --> 02:13:29.668 region:rollup2
US WHETHER NOT THEY ARE ON A

02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:31.437 region:rollup2
PATHWAY IN THE DATE WE HAVEN'T

02:13:29.668 --> 02:13:32.671 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT THE DATA SYSTEM AND

02:13:31.437 --> 02:13:33.906 region:rollup2
THE DISPARATE DATA SYSTEM THAT

02:13:32.671 --> 02:13:35.241 region:rollup2
ALL OUR SYSTEMS DON'T CONNECT

02:13:33.906 --> 02:13:36.575 region:rollup2
THEM TALK TO EACH OTHER.

02:13:35.241 --> 02:13:37.943 region:rollup2
AND SO THERE'S NO WAY OF ME

02:13:36.575 --> 02:13:39.211 region:rollup2
REALIZING OR UNDERSTANDING

02:13:37.943 --> 02:13:40.779 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT EX STUDENT THAT I

02:13:39.211 --> 02:13:42.281 region:rollup2
HAVE IN MY FINANCIALLY SYSTEM IS

02:13:40.779 --> 02:13:43.582 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY ON TRACK FOR A

02:13:42.281 --> 02:13:45.584 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR --

02:13:43.582 --> 02:13:47.186 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW PATHWAY THAT WOULD GIVE

02:13:45.584 --> 02:13:48.554 region:rollup2
THEM THIS THIS AWARD INSTEAD WE

02:13:47.186 --> 02:13:49.421 region:rollup2
HAVE TO SET A SUPPLEMENTAL

02:13:48.554 --> 02:13:50.890 region:rollup2
APPLICATION YOU KNOW WHAT

02:13:49.421 --> 02:13:52.191 region:rollup2
HAPPENS WITH THE SUPPLEMENTAL UP

02:13:50.890 --> 02:13:53.292 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T REALLY GET RETURN.

02:13:52.191 --> 02:13:54.560 region:rollup2
SO THERE ARE THINGS AND

02:13:53.292 --> 02:13:56.128 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY IN THE SYSTEM MAKE IT

02:13:54.560 --> 02:13:57.863 region:rollup2
HARDER FOR STUDENTS THAT ARE

02:13:56.128 --> 02:13:58.898 region:rollup2
THERE IS AWARDS FOR NOT TO TAKE

02:13:57.863 --> 02:14:00.399 region:rollup2
THE WORDS BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO

02:13:58.898 --> 02:14:01.600 region:rollup2
DO ONE MORE THING OR THEY HAVE

02:14:00.399 --> 02:14:02.101 region:rollup2
TO KNOW TO DO ONE MORE THING

02:14:01.600 --> 02:14:03.502 region:rollup2
YEAH.

02:14:02.101 --> 02:14:06.372 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT

02:14:03.502 --> 02:14:08.274 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT WE BUT IT'S REALLY

02:14:06.372 --> 02:14:09.842 region:rollup2
SHARING INFORMATION NO.

02:14:08.274 --> 02:14:11.977 region:rollup2
ONE INSTITUTION SHOULD OWN A

02:14:09.842 --> 02:14:12.578 region:rollup2
STUDENTS INFORMATION ESPECIALLY

02:14:11.977 --> 02:14:14.013 region:rollup2
WITH REGARDS TO A STATE TO HIM

02:14:12.578 --> 02:14:16.482 region:rollup2
--

02:14:14.013 --> 02:14:17.850 region:rollup2
AGENCY BEING ABLE SO THAT WE ALL

02:14:16.482 --> 02:14:18.984 region:rollup2
SERVE THE STUDENT RIGHT.

02:14:17.850 --> 02:14:21.053 region:rollup2
THAT'S COMPANY AND A LOT OF

02:14:18.984 --> 02:14:22.354 region:rollup2
PRIOR DUH HEARINGS WE'VE HAD

02:14:21.053 --> 02:14:24.924 region:rollup2
THEN THE NEED FOR DATA SHARING

02:14:22.354 --> 02:14:26.191 region:rollup2
AND A DATA SYSTEM.

02:14:24.924 --> 02:14:27.893 region:rollup2
BUT YET SO I I'M GLAD LUPITA

02:14:26.191 --> 02:14:30.062 region:rollup2
MENTIONED THE AT THAT CAL GRANT

02:14:27.893 --> 02:14:32.097 region:rollup2
SEE I'M NOT SURE WHAT I'M WHAT

02:14:30.062 --> 02:14:34.233 region:rollup2
GETS THE AWARD FOR THE STRANGEST

02:14:32.097 --> 02:14:35.467 region:rollup2
UP PROVISION OF OF LAW BUT

02:14:34.233 --> 02:14:37.136 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY SOME OF THE THINGS

02:14:35.467 --> 02:14:38.437 region:rollup2
AROUND CAL GRANT SEE.

02:14:37.136 --> 02:14:40.539 region:rollup2
I SEEM AN THAT TERRITORY WHERE I

02:14:38.437 --> 02:14:43.275 region:rollup2
I THINK IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY

02:14:40.539 --> 02:14:45.010 region:rollup2
HE BASICALLY CANNOT GET AN AWARD

02:14:43.275 --> 02:14:46.545 region:rollup2
FOR A PROGRAM THAT GOES ANYWHERE

02:14:45.010 --> 02:14:47.947 region:rollup2
AT IN OTHER WORDS IT HAS TO BE

02:14:46.545 --> 02:14:49.882 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT AND THEY ARE IN

02:14:47.947 --> 02:14:50.583 region:rollup2
IS NOT TRANSFERABLE ONTO

02:14:49.882 --> 02:14:52.518 region:rollup2
ANYTHING ELSE.

02:14:50.583 --> 02:14:54.453 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE CHANGED OUR THINKING

02:14:52.518 --> 02:14:55.254 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE WAY THE WAY WE SHOULD

02:14:54.453 --> 02:14:56.522 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE.

02:14:55.254 --> 02:14:57.890 region:rollup2
IT AND I THINK THAT MUST COME

02:14:56.522 --> 02:14:59.425 region:rollup2
FROM A TIME WHEN YOU WERE

02:14:57.890 --> 02:15:01.093 region:rollup2
TRAINED FOR A JOB YOU GOT THAT

02:14:59.425 --> 02:15:02.828 region:rollup2
JOB AND THEN YOU ROSE IN THAT

02:15:01.093 --> 02:15:05.364 region:rollup2
JOB AND AND THAT COULD BE YOUR

02:15:02.828 --> 02:15:07.933 region:rollup2
LIFELONG CAREER AND NOW.

02:15:05.364 --> 02:15:09.601 region:rollup2
NOW YOU NEED ONGOING TRAINING

02:15:07.933 --> 02:15:11.370 region:rollup2
AND IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO

02:15:09.601 --> 02:15:12.972 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT KIND OF A OF A OF A

02:15:11.370 --> 02:15:15.207 region:rollup2
LIMITATION --

02:15:12.972 --> 02:15:18.043 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY

02:15:15.207 --> 02:15:20.779 region:rollup2
ALLOWING STUDENTS TO ENTER WHAT

02:15:18.043 --> 02:15:23.482 region:rollup2
WHATEVER PROGRAM.

02:15:20.779 --> 02:15:24.216 region:rollup2
APPEALS TO THEM THAT'S THE WAY

02:15:23.482 --> 02:15:26.452 region:rollup2
TO GET THEM.

02:15:24.216 --> 02:15:29.254 region:rollup2
IN THE TO GO TO COLLEGE IN THE

02:15:26.452 --> 02:15:31.023 region:rollup2
FIRST PLACE AND YOU CAN DO THAT

02:15:29.254 --> 02:15:33.225 region:rollup2
YOU YOU WITH CHANGING THE CAL

02:15:31.023 --> 02:15:34.526 region:rollup2
GRANT SO THAT IT IS STILL

02:15:33.225 --> 02:15:36.395 region:rollup2
DOESN'T HAVE ALL OF THESE

02:15:34.526 --> 02:15:38.330 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT RESTRICTIONS BASED ON

02:15:36.395 --> 02:15:41.600 region:rollup2
A TIME OUT OF SCHOOL --

02:15:38.330 --> 02:15:43.636 region:rollup2
AT A HIGHLY SPECIFIC A GPA

02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:46.305 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS --

02:15:43.636 --> 02:15:48.240 region:rollup2
ALL OF THOSE THINGS.

02:15:46.305 --> 02:15:49.775 region:rollup2
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR ANYBODY

02:15:48.240 --> 02:15:51.777 region:rollup2
TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER THEY WOULD

02:15:49.775 --> 02:15:53.312 region:rollup2
BE ELIGIBLE AND IN MOST CASES

02:15:51.777 --> 02:15:55.848 region:rollup2
THE TRUTH NONTRADITIONAL

02:15:53.312 --> 02:15:56.415 region:rollup2
STUDENTS IF THEY FIGURED OUT THE

02:15:55.848 --> 02:15:58.417 region:rollup2
ANSWER IS.

02:15:56.415 --> 02:16:01.787 region:rollup2
YOU'RE NOT EIGIBLE --

02:15:58.417 --> 02:16:04.957 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S WHY THAT THE THE

02:16:01.787 --> 02:16:06.959 region:rollup2
EMPHASIS ON INCREASES IN

02:16:04.957 --> 02:16:08.460 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR. FOR THE PROGRAMS

02:16:06.959 --> 02:16:11.030 region:rollup2
THAT ARE SERVING UP COMMUNITY

02:16:08.460 --> 02:16:15.167 region:rollup2
COLLEGE STUDENTS IT ALSO BRINGS

02:16:11.030 --> 02:16:17.536 region:rollup2
UP THE POINT OF ADVISING AND

02:16:15.167 --> 02:16:19.538 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE RESOURCES MORE

02:16:17.536 --> 02:16:22.875 region:rollup2
GENERALLY COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE

02:16:19.538 --> 02:16:24.376 region:rollup2
VERY VERY STRETCHED IN THEIR

02:16:22.875 --> 02:16:26.345 region:rollup2
STAFFING --

02:16:24.376 --> 02:16:28.881 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE FOR FOR SUPPORT SUPPORT

STUDENTS UP MAY WELL THERE MIGHT

02:16:34.286 --> 02:16:36.755 region:rollup2
BE.

02:16:34.953 --> 02:16:38.724 region:rollup2

THEM THROUGH THAT --

02:16:42.261 --> 02:16:45.631 region:rollup2
IS VERY DIFFICULT TO COMMUNITY

02:16:43.362 --> 02:16:46.732 region:rollup2
COLLEGES BECAUSE A THEY THE

02:16:45.631 --> 02:16:49.234 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATIVE ONE RUN ON A

SHOESTRING AND THEY DO A VERY

02:16:49.234 --> 02:16:55.541 region:rollup2
GOOD JOB --

02:16:55.541 --> 02:16:57.543 region:rollup2

THE ADVISER RATIO IS IS SUCH

02:16:59.678 --> 02:17:01.780 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:17:00.579 --> 02:17:03.449 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S DIFFICULT TO DO THE

02:17:01.780 --> 02:17:05.217 region:rollup2
KIND OF OUTREACH THAT WOULD

02:17:03.449 --> 02:17:06.719 region:rollup2

MONEY COULD HAVE A BIG OUR ALLY

02:17:09.455 --> 02:17:12.725 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF STUDENTS GETTING

02:17:10.622 --> 02:17:15.194 region:rollup2

ABLE TO MOVE ON I'M YOU ALL.

02:17:15.194 --> 02:17:18.864 region:rollup2
MENTIONED THE INADEQUACIES SOME

02:17:17.396 --> 02:17:20.499 region:rollup2
INADEQUACIES AROUND THE THE

02:17:18.864 --> 02:17:22.301 region:rollup2
CURRENT CAL GRANT STRUCTURE --

02:17:20.499 --> 02:17:24.002 region:rollup2
AND ENCOURAGED --

02:17:22.301 --> 02:17:26.205 region:rollup2
REFORM OF THAT STRUCTURE

02:17:24.002 --> 02:17:28.073 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY WHAT I'VE SEEN AND I

02:17:26.205 --> 02:17:29.708 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN HERE THAT LONG --

02:17:28.073 --> 02:17:31.143 region:rollup2
ANYTIME YOU REFORM SOMETHING

02:17:29.708 --> 02:17:32.544 region:rollup2
OTHERS WINNERS AND LOSERS IN THE

02:17:31.143 --> 02:17:34.480 region:rollup2
LOSERS DURING A GOOD JOB OF

02:17:32.544 --> 02:17:35.481 region:rollup2
KILLING THE REFORM BEFORE YOU

02:17:34.480 --> 02:17:36.782 region:rollup2
CAN ACCOMPLISH IT.

02:17:35.481 --> 02:17:38.217 region:rollup2
IS THERE FROM WHAT YOU'VE SEEN

02:17:36.782 --> 02:17:39.585 region:rollup2
OF OF DIFFERENT MODELS FOR

02:17:38.217 --> 02:17:40.185 region:rollup2
REFORMING THE CAL GRANT SYSTEM

02:17:39.585 --> 02:17:41.353 region:rollup2
IS THEIR WAY TO DO THIS WHERE

02:17:40.185 --> 02:17:43.155 region:rollup2
EVERYONE WINS.

02:17:41.353 --> 02:17:45.657 region:rollup2
OR WILL WILL WILL THERE

02:17:43.155 --> 02:17:47.993 region:rollup2
INEVITABLY BE BE SOME LOSERS

02:17:45.657 --> 02:17:49.261 region:rollup2
THAT ARE GONNA --

02:17:47.993 --> 02:17:49.561 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW KIND OF TRY TO OPPOSE

02:17:49.261 --> 02:17:51.597 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

02:17:49.561 --> 02:17:53.232 region:rollup2
THOSE EFFORTS.

02:17:51.597 --> 02:17:54.466 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT WE WE WE'VE WE'VE

02:17:53.232 --> 02:17:56.235 region:rollup2
BEEN MEETING WITH THE FIVE

02:17:54.466 --> 02:17:58.203 region:rollup2
SEGMENTS TRYING TO GET SOME IN A

02:17:56.235 --> 02:18:00.372 region:rollup2
CONSENSUS AROUND AT LEAST THAT

02:17:58.203 --> 02:18:01.206 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATION AND IN GENERAL

02:18:00.372 --> 02:18:02.574 region:rollup2
THERE'S A SUPPORT FOR

02:18:01.206 --> 02:18:04.143 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATION.

02:18:02.574 --> 02:18:05.344 region:rollup2
BUT IT.

02:18:04.143 --> 02:18:06.645 region:rollup2
IN THE END THE COMMITTEE CALLED

02:18:05.344 --> 02:18:08.781 region:rollup2
SEGMENT DOESN'T REALLY WENT OUT

02:18:06.645 --> 02:18:10.182 region:rollup2
THERE THREE STACKED ME BUT IT'S

02:18:08.781 --> 02:18:11.850 region:rollup2
NOT NECESSARILY IN THEIR FAVOR.

02:18:10.182 --> 02:18:13.118 region:rollup2
UNLESS THE BE ACCESS AWARD IS

02:18:11.850 --> 02:18:14.853 region:rollup2
INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY TO

02:18:13.118 --> 02:18:16.355 region:rollup2
ASSIST THEIR STUDENTS SO.

02:18:14.853 --> 02:18:17.289 region:rollup2
ALL BOATS HAVE TO RISE AND WE

02:18:16.355 --> 02:18:19.124 region:rollup2
ALL KNOW THAT WE HAVE ALL SEEN

02:18:17.289 --> 02:18:20.292 region:rollup2
IN K. TWELVE AND COALITION WHEN

02:18:19.124 --> 02:18:22.494 region:rollup2
THEY COME AND LOBBY ALL VOTES

02:18:20.292 --> 02:18:23.328 region:rollup2
HAVE TO RISE IN ORDER FOR

02:18:22.494 --> 02:18:25.430 region:rollup2
EVERYONE TO BE ON BOARD.

02:18:23.328 --> 02:18:26.865 region:rollup2
WE'VE COSTED OUT THE

02:18:25.430 --> 02:18:28.534 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATION THAT WE HAVE THE

02:18:26.865 --> 02:18:29.434 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATION AND STREAMLINED TO

02:18:28.534 --> 02:18:31.103 region:rollup2
ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

02:18:29.434 --> 02:18:33.005 region:rollup2
DOLLARS WE WERE TO INCREASE THE

02:18:31.103 --> 02:18:34.439 region:rollup2
ACCESS AWARD TO THE LITTLE NEXT

02:18:33.005 --> 02:18:35.741 region:rollup2
LEVEL UP IS ABOUT A HUNDRED

02:18:34.439 --> 02:18:36.341 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS --

02:18:35.741 --> 02:18:39.111 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW THAT SOUNDS LIKE A

02:18:36.341 --> 02:18:40.813 region:rollup2
LOT OF MONEY BUT THIS IS.

02:18:39.111 --> 02:18:41.847 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU'RE NOT GETTING YOUR ROI

02:18:40.813 --> 02:18:43.782 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU'RE PUTTING IN THE

02:18:41.847 --> 02:18:44.817 region:rollup2
CURRENT TWO BILLION DOLLARS AND

02:18:43.782 --> 02:18:45.984 region:rollup2
YOU'RE NOT GETTING THE STUDENT

02:18:44.817 --> 02:18:47.853 region:rollup2
SUCCESS THAT YOU WANT OUT OF IT

02:18:45.984 --> 02:18:50.189 region:rollup2
SO THERE IS A DISCONNECT BETWEEN

02:18:47.853 --> 02:18:51.490 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT THE STATE WANTS AND

02:18:50.189 --> 02:18:52.591 region:rollup2
WHAT THE STATE'S GETTING IT WITH

02:18:51.490 --> 02:18:54.660 region:rollup2
REGARDS TO THEIR RETURN ON?

02:18:52.591 --> 02:18:56.295 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT SO I DO THINK THERE

02:18:54.660 --> 02:18:57.663 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE AN INVESTMENT --

02:18:56.295 --> 02:18:59.631 region:rollup2
AND WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT SORT

02:18:57.663 --> 02:19:00.866 region:rollup2
OF HOW DO WE INCENTIVIZE IT SO

02:18:59.631 --> 02:19:02.367 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THE COMMITTEE COLLEGE

02:19:00.866 --> 02:19:05.204 region:rollup2
SEGMENT DOES FEEL THAT THEY'RE A

02:19:02.367 --> 02:19:07.372 region:rollup2
PART OF A DEAL THE WINNERS.

OCCURRED OVER THE LAST YEAR.

FROM THIS WORK. ONE CONVERSATION

02:39:39.069 --> 02:39:43.007 region:rollup2
WE ARE CONCERNED TO HEAR IS THE

02:39:40.771 --> 02:39:43.941 region:rollup2
UNRAVELING OF FINANCIAL AID TO

02:39:43.007 --> 02:39:45.309 region:rollup2
ONLY FOCUS ON TUITION COSTS IN

02:39:43.941 --> 02:39:47.178 region:rollup2
THE CSU.

02:39:45.309 --> 02:39:49.079 region:rollup2
WHICH HAS ONLY ONE FOURTH OF

02:39:47.178 --> 02:39:50.714 region:rollup2
WHAT IT COST TO ATTEND THE CSU.

02:39:49.079 --> 02:39:51.449 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WHO HAVE THEIR TUITION

02:39:50.714 --> 02:39:52.950 region:rollup2
COVERED ARE STILL STRUGGLING

02:39:51.449 --> 02:39:54.785 region:rollup2
WITH THAT HOMELESSNESS AND FOOD

02:39:52.950 --> 02:39:57.688 region:rollup2
INSECURITY.

02:39:54.785 --> 02:39:59.457 region:rollup2
AND ME MORE NOT LESS AID. ONE

02:39:57.688 --> 02:40:00.891 region:rollup2
POINT THAT WE'D LIKE TO MAKE IS

02:39:59.457 --> 02:40:02.193 region:rollup2
THE ABSOLUTE NEED FOR A MULTI

02:40:00.891 --> 02:40:03.094 region:rollup2
YEAR FUNDING AGREEMENT BETWEEN

02:40:02.193 --> 02:40:04.728 region:rollup2
THE STATE AND THE CAL STATE

02:40:03.094 --> 02:40:06.430 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

02:40:04.728 --> 02:40:07.898 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY EACH YEAR THE CSU

02:40:06.430 --> 02:40:09.533 region:rollup2
BOARD OF TRUSTEES CREATES A

02:40:07.898 --> 02:40:10.901 region:rollup2
FUNDING REQUEST TO THE STATE.

02:40:09.533 --> 02:40:13.003 region:rollup2
AN INSTITUTION AND STAKEHOLDERS

02:40:10.901 --> 02:40:14.805 region:rollup2
LIKE ICE ADVOCATE FOR A FULLY

02:40:13.003 --> 02:40:16.674 region:rollup2
FUNDED BUDGET.

02:40:14.805 --> 02:40:18.375 region:rollup2

SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FLAVORS.

02:40:19.677 --> 02:40:23.214 region:rollup2
A THRIVING CAL STATE SYSTEM AS

02:40:21.378 --> 02:40:26.684 region:rollup2
THE ABSOLUTE KEY TO THE SUCCESS

02:40:23.214 --> 02:40:27.985 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE.

02:40:26.684 --> 02:40:29.353 region:rollup2
THIS PROCESS IS ABSOLUTELY

02:40:27.985 --> 02:40:32.356 region:rollup2
EXHAUSTING AND IT IS

02:40:29.353 --> 02:40:33.891 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTALLY NOT WORKING.

02:40:32.356 --> 02:40:35.159 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T WORK FOR THE CSU AT

02:40:33.891 --> 02:40:35.993 region:rollup2
DOESN'T WORK FOR THE STATE AND

02:40:35.159 --> 02:40:38.095 region:rollup2
IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T WORK FOR

02:40:35.993 --> 02:40:39.363 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

02:40:38.095 --> 02:40:40.931 region:rollup2
WITHOUT A MULTI YEAR FOR THE

02:40:39.363 --> 02:40:41.732 region:rollup2
BUDGET AGREEMENT WE CANNOT

02:40:40.931 --> 02:40:43.200 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISH ALL OF OUR SHARED

02:40:41.732 --> 02:40:44.835 region:rollup2
GOALS.

02:40:43.200 --> 02:40:46.170 region:rollup2
LIKE INCREASE GRADUATION RATES

02:40:44.835 --> 02:40:48.005 region:rollup2
AND LIMIT THEIR ACHIEVEMENT OR

02:40:46.170 --> 02:40:49.306 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY GAP.

02:40:48.005 --> 02:40:50.374 region:rollup2
WITHOUT A MULTI YEAR BUDGET

02:40:49.306 --> 02:40:51.809 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT WE CAN'T

02:40:50.374 --> 02:40:53.777 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVELY ADDRESSED THE

02:40:51.809 --> 02:40:55.045 region:rollup2
NEAR THREE BILLION DOLLARS

02:40:53.777 --> 02:40:56.380 region:rollup2
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG IN

02:40:55.045 --> 02:40:57.681 region:rollup2
THE CSU.

02:40:56.380 --> 02:40:59.650 region:rollup2
WITHOUT A MULTI YEAR BUDGET

02:40:57.681 --> 02:41:01.051 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT MORE STUDENTS WILL BE

02:40:59.650 --> 02:41:02.520 region:rollup2
TURNED AWAY FROM THE INSTITUTION

02:41:01.051 --> 02:41:03.521 region:rollup2
BECAUSE NO LONG TERM ENROLLMENT

02:41:02.520 --> 02:41:05.389 region:rollup2
STRATEGY CAN BE REASONABLY

02:41:03.521 --> 02:41:07.157 region:rollup2
ADOPTED.

02:41:05.389 --> 02:41:08.659 region:rollup2
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY.

02:41:07.157 --> 02:41:10.060 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ARE LEFT DEFENSELESS

02:41:08.659 --> 02:41:10.961 region:rollup2
AGAINST UNPREDICTABLE AND

02:41:10.060 --> 02:41:12.663 region:rollup2
VOLATILE TUITION AND FEE

02:41:10.961 --> 02:41:14.932 region:rollup2
INCREASES.

CASTING SYSTEM.

02:41:20.137 --> 02:41:23.040 region:rollup2
WHICH IS WHY A MULTI YEAR

02:41:21.639 --> 02:41:24.475 region:rollup2
FUNDING AGREEMENT BETWEEN ALL

02:41:23.040 --> 02:41:26.744 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS IS CRUCIAL TO LONG

02:41:24.475 --> 02:41:26.977 region:rollup2
TERM SUCCESS OF THE CAL STATE

02:41:26.744 --> 02:41:28.078 region:rollup2

THROUGH THIS. FOR DECADES THE

02:41:37.354 --> 02:41:40.424 region:rollup2
IDEALS THE MASTER PLAN HAS STOOD

02:41:39.190 --> 02:41:43.460 region:rollup2
FOR HAS PLACED CALIFORNIA'S

02:41:40.424 --> 02:41:44.895 region:rollup2

A STATE ON A HILL IF YOU WILL.

02:41:44.895 --> 02:41:48.232 region:rollup2
ONE IN PARTICULAR OWN FOCUS ON

02:41:46.263 --> 02:41:49.300 region:rollup2
IS THAT ACADEMIC PROGRESS SHOULD

02:41:48.232 --> 02:41:50.334 region:rollup2
BE LIMITED ONLY BY AN

02:41:49.300 --> 02:41:53.370 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL'S PROFICIENCY.

ECONOMIC BACKGROUND.

02:41:55.773 --> 02:41:59.310 region:rollup2
HOWEVER IF WE MEASURE OUR

02:41:57.508 --> 02:42:01.979 region:rollup2
SUCCESS BY GRADUATION RATES

02:41:59.310 --> 02:42:03.948 region:rollup2
STUDENTS A FULFILLMENT OF BASIC

02:42:01.979 --> 02:42:05.115 region:rollup2
NEEDS AND EMPLOYMENT RATES.

02:42:03.948 --> 02:42:07.051 region:rollup2
I'D SAY THAT CALIFORNIA HAS

02:42:05.115 --> 02:42:08.152 region:rollup2
BEGUN TO SLIP.

02:42:07.051 --> 02:42:09.853 region:rollup2

CONVENING THIS MEETING BUT FACT

02:55:25.448 --> 02:55:27.884 region:rollup2
FIRMLY BELIEVES THAT THE

02:55:26.750 --> 02:55:29.819 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM SHOULD

02:55:27.884 --> 02:55:31.488 region:rollup2

02:55:42.799 --> 02:55:45.935 region:rollup2
THAT IT IS UNCLEAR HOW PUNISHING

02:55:44.601 --> 02:55:47.537 region:rollup2
COLLEGES WITH POOR PERFORMANCE

02:55:45.935 --> 02:55:49.639 region:rollup2
BY REDUCING FUNDING WILL LEAD TO

BETTER PERFORMANCE WHAT WE KNOW

02:55:49.639 --> 02:55:51.241 region:rollup2
