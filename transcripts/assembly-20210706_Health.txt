AND NUMBER SEVENTEEN SB EIGHT TWENTY THREE A HEALTH COMMITTEE BILL. WITH THAT. I BELIEVE WE ARE READY TO GO TO OUR FIRST AUTHOR AND THIS WE HAVE TO HAVE A QUORUM THREE FIVE. NUMBER SHORT. MAY NOT IN STATURE BUT IN NUMBER SO- WILL GO AHEAD AND TO OUR FIRST WITNESS OUR FIRST A BILL EXCUSE ME I SEE SENATOR CAFIERO HER PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT. SB THREE SIXTY FIVE. WHICH WOULD REQUIRE MEDICAL TO REIMBURSE ALL PARTICIPATING PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS INCLUDING THOSE WHO OPERATE OUT OF A FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CLINICS FOR RURAL HEALTH CLINIC. FOR ECON SALT SERVICES. CONSUL SERVICES ARE TRULY A PATIENT CENTERED INNOVATION BALLAUGH ONE PROVIDER USUALLY A PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER. TO SEND ELECTRONIC CONSOLE TO ANOTHER PROVIDER WHO IS USUALLY A SPECIALIST WHEN A PATIENT HAS A QUESTION- CONDITION REQUIRING SPECIALTY CARE. THE SPECIALTY THEN GIVE THE RESPONSE TO THE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER AND IT COULD VERY FROM WANTING TO SEE THE PATIENT IN PERSON TO RECOMMENDING A PRESCRIPTION OR A COURSE OF CARE. HE COUNSELED OFFER TIMELY RESOLUTIONS FOR PATIENTS WHO MAY OTHERWISE WAIT WEEKS OR MONTHS TO SEE A SPECIALIST FOR SOMETHING THAT THEY MAY NOT. THAT MAY NOT REQUIRED TO PUT IN AN APPOINTMENT IN THE FIRST PLACE. CURRENTLY EACH CONSOLE SERVICES ARE REIMBURSABLE FOR THE PROVIDERS AT THE DISTANCE SITE. AND THESE ARE USUALLY THE SPECIALIST HOWEVER THE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER AT THE ORIGINATING SITE IT'S NOT ABLE TO BILL FOR THE TELEHEALTH SERVICE. BOTH PROVIDERS BRING EXPERTISE IN INFORMATION TO THE TABLE WHEN DISCUSSING THE PATIENT'S CONDITION BUT ONLY THE SPECIALIST IS REIMBURSED FOR THEIR TIME. IN FACT IT COULD BE ARGUED THAT THE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN IS GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND BY EACH COUNCIL CONSULTING WITH THE SPECIALIST REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE PATIENT IS EVENTUALLY REFERRED. THE PATIENT IS REFERRED FOR AN APPOINTMENT THE SPECIALIST NOW HAS BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE PATIENT'S CONDITION AND THE VISIT WILL BE WELL SPENT ON NEXT STEPS INSTEAD OF INFORMATION GATHERING. AND IF NO REFERRAL IS NEEDED THEN THE PATIENT WILL HAVE THE QUESTIONS ADDRESSED WITHIN DAYS THANKS TO THIS FORM OF TELEHEALTH. EITHER OF THESE OUTCOMES BENEFIT THE PATIENT MORE THAN A SIMPLE REFERRAL. THIS COMMUNICATION IS A GREAT BENEFIT TO RURAL RESIDENTS AS YOU KNOW WE'RE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IN GENERAL HAS BEEN A LONG STANDING ISSUE. IN RURAL DISTRICTS IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO GET AN APPOINTMENT WITH A GENERAL PRACTITIONER LET ALONE A SPECIALIST. WHO IS USUALLY OUT OF TOWN ESPECIALLY SINCE SPECIALLY. CARE IS STRESSED IN ALL SECTORS OF OUR HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY. USE OF AN ECON SALT WOULD DETERMINE IF OF THIS IF A PHYSICAL VISIT IS IN FACT NEEDED. SAVING RURAL PATIENTS TIME AND MONEY. IT ALSO GETS THE PATIENT'S CONCERNS ADDRESSED MORE QUICKLY. I THINK THE DATA SHOWS VERY CLEARLY THAT FOLLOW UP SPECIALTY VISITS ARE. MORE LIKELY NOT TO HAPPEN WHEN THE DISTANCE IS- IS PROHIBITIVE. SB THREE SIXTY FIVE IS A SMALL CHANGE TO THE BILLABLE TELEHEALTH SERVICES IN MEDICAL. AND I BELIEVE THIS BILL WILL NOT ONLY CREATE EQUITY FOR THE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER BUT MOST MOST IMPORTANTLY WILL IMPROVE CARE FOR THE PATIENTS THANK THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE BUT TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR I BELIEVE WE HAVE TO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT MOLEST THE- TELEPHONE OPERATOR TO OPEN THE LINE FOR THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND WILL FIRST GO TO Y. NINETY EIGHT YOUR LINE IS OPEN. HE HAD ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS REPORT. WHOOPS THOSE ARE NOT PRIMARY THE WE HAVE TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. AND YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IT-NEARLY THEIR LIVES SHOULD BE OPEN OKAY THANK YOU THAT THAT I BELIEVE THAT WAS A ME TOO SO. THE PLEASE PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. HELLO THIS IS DANIELLE ORRIN HELLO MISTER CHAIR AND SENATORS. AND THANKS FOR INVITING ME TO JOIN YOU TODAY TO PRESENT ON SB THREE SIXTY FIVE WHICH WOULD REQUIRE MEDICARE TO REIMBURSE INVOLVED PROVIDERS FOR ECON FULL SERVICES. INCLUDING FQHCS. AND RURAL HEALTH CENTERS MY NAME IS DANIEL OREN AND I'M CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER OF RECORD COMMUNITY HEALTH COALITION. WE ARE A CONSORTIUM MADE UP OF SEVENTEEN MEMBER COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS AND NAPA MARIN SONOMA. AND YOLO COUNTIES WE SERVE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO THOUSAND PATIENTS. AND I AM ALSO A PRACTICING FAMILY PHYSICIAN AT PETALUMA HEALTH CENTER WHICH IS A FEDERALLY QUALIFIED COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER AND SONOMA COUNTY. OUR CLINICS CONTROL PROGRAM HAS BEEN A LIFELINE FOR EXPANDING ACCESS TO OUR CARE FOR OUR PATIENTS OFTEN OUR PATIENTS HAVE TO WAIT WEEKS TO MONTHS FOR SPECIALTY APPOINTMENT. ECON FOLKS HELP TO RELIEVE THE WAIT TIMES FOR APPOINTMENTS BY ENABLING MANY PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE THEIR PATIENTS CARE WITHOUT THE NEED FOR AN IN PERSON SPECIAL PIZZAS THAT. ARE IN OUR CONSORTIUM OVER 50% OF THE CASES WHERE PATIENTS RECEIVED AN ECON SALT- IT RESULTED IN AND AVOIDED REFERRAL DIAGNOSTIC TEST OR PROCEDURE. ALLOWING FOR BOTH THE TREATING PROVIDER A PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER AND TO CONSULT THE PROVIDER OR SPECIALIST TO BILL FOR ECON FOLKS WILL ENSURE THAT PROVIDERS GET COMPENSATED FOR THE TIME SPENT ON SERVICES OUTSIDE. OF CLINIC VISITS SHOULD MY COLLEAGUES AT MY CLINICS IN OTHER APPS YOU AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE BE ABLE TO BUILD FREE CONSOLE SEPARATELY FROM THEIR CLINIC VISITS. THE STATE WOULD BE MAKING AN INVESTMENT IN INNOVATIVE CARE PRACTICES AND TECHNOLOGY ALREADY IN USE THAT LARGER HEALTH SYSTEMS THAT SERVE MANY CALIFORNIANS ON COMMERCIAL PLANTS. IN A YEAR WHERE PARITY AND EQUITY ARE OF CONCERN TO STAKEHOLDERS AND POLICYMAKERS ALIKE I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT SB THREE SIXTY FIVE. AND HE CONSOLE AS A CRITICAL TOOL FOR SAFETY NET PROVIDERS SERVING OUR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE'LL. MOVE ON TO OUR SECOND WITNESS PLEASE.

THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIR WOULD- I WANT TO START BY THANKING THE CHAIRMAN AND THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT. SEVEN FORTY NINE AM BY ACCEPTING THE PROPOSED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND THANK MY JOIN AUTHOR ON THIS MEASURE CENTER EGGMAN. AND ALSO TO ACKNOWLEDGE ASSEMBLY MEMBER- ARAMBULA WHO IS HAD- IT HAS WORKED IN THIS AREA AND SHOWN GREAT LEADERSHIP IN THE SPACE AND THEN LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH HIM. ON THIS AND NINE OTHER OTHER MEASURES- BUT THIS BILL IS A TRANSPARENCY MEASURE THAT WILL PROVIDE INSIGHT TO POLICY MAKERS AND STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS THE STATE. ABOUT HOW COUNTIES ARE USING THEIR MENTAL HEALTH FUNDS AND HOW THOSE FUNDS ARE SERVING. OUR CONSTITUENTS. WE SPEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR IN AN EFFORT TO HELP CALIFORNIANS SUFFERING FROM MENTAL ILLNESS BUT WE HAVE PRECIOUS LITTLE DATA. TO HELP US UNDERSTAND WHICH OF THE PROGRAM FOR FUNDING OR THE MOSTEFFECTIVE. WHICH OF THEM ARE ACTUALLY HELPING THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DESPERATELY IN NEED OF THIS ASSISTANCE. THIS IS NOT JUST MY OPINION IT'S THE VIEW OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR. LAST SUMMER THE STATE AUDITOR RELEASED A REPORT DETAILING THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY FOR HOW MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FUNDS ARE BEING USED. AND THE BENEFITS FOR THOSE SERVICES. THIS BILL WOULD CHANGE THAT BASED ON THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE AUDITOR IT WOULD CREATE A STATE FRAMEWORK FOR COLLECTING INFORMATION. ON MENTAL HEALTH SPENDING AND OUTCOMES THROUGH THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. UNDER THIS BILL THE COMMISSION WOULD BE REQUIRED TO COLLABORATE WITH STATE AND LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH AGENCIES. TO CREATE A COMPREHENSIVE TRACKING PROGRAM FOR COUNTY SPENDING ON MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS. AND THE OUTCOMES FROM THAT SPENDING. COMMISSION WOULD PROVIDE ASSESSMENTS. OF A SPENDING AN OUTCOME PATTERNS BY DEVELOPING CATEGORIES A MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. INCLUDING EMERGENCY SERVICES AN INPATIENT SERVICES. CURRENTLY REPORTING RELIES ON DISJOINTED. AND INCOMPLETE TOOLS. A RESULT OF MULTIPLE FUNDING SOURCES. WITH DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS AND LEVELS OF TRANSPARENCY. THIS BILL IS A STRAIGHTFORWARD SOLUTION. TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIANS WILL BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW COUNTIES ARE SPENDING FUNDS FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND HOW THESE FUNDS ARE BEING USED TO IMPROVE CONSTITUENTS MENTAL HEALTH. I WITH ME TODAY IS TOBY EWING FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION TO TESTIFY WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR WILL OPEN THE PHONE LINES FOR THE WITNESS IN SUPPORT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY MISTER EWING. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OPERATIVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB SEVEN FORTY NINE I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FIRST LEADERSHIP ON THIS AS WELL. THIS IS TOBY OWING ON BEHALF OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. AS YOU KNOW. AS YOU MAY KNOW CALIFORNIA'S MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT CALLED FOR ENHANCED COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND HOW WE ORGANIZE AND DELIVER MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THAT WAS TO INCREASE AWARENESS OF WHAT'S WORKING AND WHAT'S NOT WORKING SO THAT WE CAN REALLY TAP INTO. ALL OF THE OPPORTUNITIES AND IDEAS. AND PERSPECTIVES ACROSS CALIFORNIA REALLY STRENGTHEN OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. THE ACT ALSO CALLED FOR GREATER OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE CREATING THE LEVEL OF. A PUBLIC TRUST IN THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE. IN IDEALLY BUILDING THAT PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT TO REALLY DRIVE TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE. IT IT'S FAR TOO DIFFICULT TODAY TO REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW OUR SYSTEM IS FUNDED HOW FUNDS ARE BEING USED IN THE OUTCOMES THAT ARE. THAT WERE CHEATING WITH THOSE DOLLARS WERE MAKING GREAT PROGRESS BUT THERE'S MORE WORK TO DO AS IS CLEAR TO ANYBODY WHO HAS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY. TO WALK NEXT STEPS IN OUR URBAN AREAS AND SEE THE KIND OF CHALLENGES WE HAVE. THE STATE. COMMISSIONS ROUTINELY ASKED BY POLICY MAKERS BUT ALSO THE PUBLIC ABOUT COST ABOUT OUTCOMES. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT- EQUALLY SIGNIFICANTLY HERE FROM COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH LEADERS AND PROVIDERS WHO. ARE CONSISTENTLY ASKING ABOUT WHAT OTHER COUNTIES ARE DOING WHAT OTHER STATES ARE DOING. BECAUSE THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW WE CAN IMPROVE. SB SEVEN FORTY NINE LAYS OUT AN AMBITIOUS BUT A VERY PRACTICAL AGENDA TO BRING TOGETHER DISPARATE INFORMATION TO ALLOW A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. INCLUDING WHAT'S WORKING WHERE CHANGE IS NEEDED AND HOW WE CAN STRENGTHEN THE WAY WE CARE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS ACROSS THE STATE. SB SEVEN FORTY NINE BETTER POSITIONS EVERYONE IS IMPACTED BY MENTAL HEALTH TO ENGAGE IN OPTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT FOR THAT REASON THE COMMISSION SUPPORTS THE BILL. AND WE'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER EWING WILL WE DO HAVE A WITNESS IN OPPOSITION I WILL OPEN THE PHONE LINES FOR THE WITNESS. IN OPPOSITION PLEASE GO AHEAD WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU SURE WOULD ANY OTHER HAVE OVER THE COUNTY. HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION ALTHOUGH WE ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH THE PURPOSE OF. THIS BILL AS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS. UNFORTUNATELY WE DO THE WITH THE- BECAUSE IT'LL RESULT IN. REPORTING FOR. AND ANNETTE. ADDITION COSTS. THE BILL CHARGES THE MENTAL HEALTH TO. OVER IN ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION WITH CREATING A COMPREHENSIVE TRACKING PROGRAM FOR COUNTY SPENDING ON MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROGRAMS. AND SERVICES INCLUDING FUNDING SOURCES AND HOW COME DATA. BECAUSE THE COMMISSION- WITH. ALL OF THAT WE RESPECT THAT DAY. A WORK OF THE COMMISSION THEY DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE A ROLE IN THE DELIVERY OF BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES UNDER MEDICARE I'LL- A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE DATA INVOKED. IN SB SEVEN FORTY NINE WOULD BE THE EXACT SAME DATA CURRENTLY COLLECTED. BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. SUBDIVISION C. OF SB SEVEN FORTY NINE WOULD REQUIRE COUNTIES TO REPORT. THIS EXACTING DATA TO THE COMMISSION RESULTING IN UNNECESSARY AND DUPLICATIVE COSTS FOR COUNTIES AND THE STATE. THE COMMISSION STAFF WITH THEIR VERY SIGNIFICANT EXPERTISE. FOCUSED ON THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT AS EXPRESSED BY MISTER EWING. UNFORTUNATELY DO NOT HAVE THE SAME LEVEL OF EXPERTISE HOW'S THAT THE ATF ON THE MEDIC CAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM. INCLUDING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES WHICH ARE NOT CURRENTLY PART OF THE MHSAA. THIS RAISES CONCERNS WITH SB SEVEN FORTY NINE SHARKS OF THE COMMISSION DEVELOP PERFORMANCE MEASURES. AND OUTCOMES IN THESE AREAS. SOME OF WHICH ARE ALREADY PART OF THE P. EIGHTY S. B. Q. R. O. OR- EXTERNAL QUALITY REVIEW ORGANIZATION REPORTING. AGAIN CREATING UNNECESSARY DUPLICATION. TBH P. A. CONTINUES TO FIRMLY BELIEVES THAT THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY IS A MORE APPROPRIATE ENTITY TO REALIZE WITH A VERY IMPORTANT. AND MERITORIOUS PURPOSE THAT OUTLINED IN SB SEVEN FORTY NINE. HHF HAS THE AUTHORITY OVER ALL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. INCLUDING THOSE UNDER. G. ACS AND MHSAA FUN BEING UNDER HHS LEADERSHIP NEW RECORDING. CAN BE RETRIEVED. ALONGSIDE WITH IT ANY CURRENT UNLESS. REPORTING QUITE A THEY CAN REDUCE TO MAKE THE CALL. TO THE SYSTEM OVER. WE BELIEVE IN A FUTURE LED EFFORT WITH IN A MORNING. WITH FRAMEWORK FOR MANAGING CONFORM AND NOW AND- PUBLIC BEHAVIOR HEALTH DELIVERY SINCE. THEY CAN ITSELF NOTES THE SICK COST THE THIRTY. WITH A FORMAL RESPONSE S. B. C. FORTY NINE TO WHICH WOULD REQUIRE RESOURCES. FOR THE COMMISSION TO PROCESS AND ANALYZE COST REPORTS AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER EXPENDITURES EITHER AREAS ALREADY EVALUATED BY THE ATS AND THEREFORE CREATING ANOTHER DUPLICATE THE PROCESS. BECAUSE OF THE ADDED COST OF DUPLICATE DUPLICATIVE REPORTING AND EVALUATION EBITA RESPECTFULLY OPPOSES SB. SEVEN FORTY NINE AND URGES THE NUMBER THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WILL MOVE TO THE LINES IS THERE ANYONE IN THE GALLERY WISHES TO TESTIFY IN THIS BILL SEE NO ONE WILL GO TO THE PHONE LINES. AND WOULD JUST BE ASKING OUR WITNESSES FOR THEIR POSITION ON THE BILL- ANY RECORD ORGANIZATION IN MY REPRESENT AND NOTHING FURTHER SO PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU AND AGAIN AT ONE AND THEN GENERAL.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS PLEASURE TO BE HERE GOOD AFTERNOON- I'M REALLY PROUD TO PRESENT SB SIX EIGHTY SEVEN THIS IS A BILL THAT WOULD REQUIRE REQUIRE TRAUMA KITS. TO BE PLACED IN CERTAIN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE BUILT BUILDINGS IN ORDER TO HELP TREAT INDIVIDUALS AND THE EVENT THAT THE REQUIREMENT EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE BEFORE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS CAN ARRIVE ON SITE. IN TWENTY TWELVE IN RESPONSE TO THE HORRIFIC HORRIFIC MASS SHOOTING OF SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. A GROUP OF DOCTORS DECIDED TO CREATE THE NATIONAL STOP THE BLEED CAMPAIGN TO WEARS A RAISE AWARENESS INCREASE TRAINING FOR BYSTANDERS AND EMERGENCY DRAMATIC EVENTS. STANDARD FIRST AID KITS ARE VERY HELPFUL BUT THEY DO NOT CONTAIN THE ADEQUATE EQUIPMENT. NECESSARY TO TREAT VICTIMS WERE DEALING WITH HEAVY BLEEDING. SB SIX EIGHTY SEVEN WOULD REQUIRE THE TRAUMA KITS CONTAIN THE NECESSARY. JUST TOURNIQUETS THAT HAVE HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO INCREASE THE CHANCE OF SURVIVAL FOR TRAUMA VICTIMS. THIS BILL IS I AM VERY NEEDED MUCH OVERDUE WE'VE HAD SEVERAL OF OTHER LEGISLATORS PUSHES BILL PREVIOUS YEARS WORK AND- ONE OF ONE OF THE MEMBERS IS HERE OF. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ WE ALSO HAD SOME OF THE MEMBER STEINORTH THE TRIED OF. AND IT IT JUST BEHOOVES ME I DON'T KNOW WHY WE HAVEN'T DONE THIS THIS IS SO IMPORTANT THIS COULD HELP SAVE LIVES. I APPROVED A BILL THAT WOULD WOULD PUT EIGHTY DAYS IN IN BUILDINGS ACROSS THE STATE AND- AND I CAN NAME SEVERAL PEOPLE THAT I KNOW PERSONAL WHOSE LIVES HAVE BEEN SAVED. BY SIMPLY HAVING AN ADD ONSITE THIS COULD DO THE EXACT SAME FOR ABOUT A FOR A LOT LESS COST. THESE TRAUMA KITS ARE VERY INEXPENSIVE AND THEY COULD MAKE THE DIFFERENCE AND HELP SAVING LIVES. WHAT WHAT PRICE DO WE PUT ON HUMAN LIFE THEN IT IN THE STATE IF WE MAKE JUST A VERY MINOR. EXPENSE IN HAVING THESE SUCCESSFUL WE COULD HELP SAVE NUMEROUS LIVES ACROSS THE STATE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT I HAVE A- DR EMILY PART THAT WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS AT FIFTY WOULD ALLOW. MISTER CHAIRMAN IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. ABSOLUTELY MY PLEASURE- AND THANK YOU FOR PRESENTING THE BILL WILL GO TO THE PHONE LINES FOR THE WITNESS IN SUPPORT- WHENEVER YOU'RE READY DOCTOR LEAPER. GREAT THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN- MY NAME IS DR ANY LOOK FOR AND I AM A TRAUMA SURGEON- AT UC SAN DIEGO HEALTH TODAY I'M REPRESENTING MYSELF.

CAN HAPPEN ANYWHERE AT HOME AT THE WORKPLACE IN TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS AND YES THE MATH CASUALTY EVENT. THEY CAN BE ACCIDENTAL INTENTIONAL OR THE RESULT OF A NATURAL DISASTER INCLUDING EARTHQUAKE. ADVANCES IN BLEEDING CONTROL TECHNIQUES AND PARTICULARLY THE USE OF TOURNIQUETS HAVE EXPANDED IN RECENT YEARS. UNDER MILITARY FOR VIEW OF FAIR USE AND THE COMBAT STUDIES AND HAVE LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF BLEEDING CONTROL- EDUCATIONAL COURSES FOR THE PUBLIC. AND AN UNTHINKABLE CRIME OF THE MASS SHOOTING AT SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. IT'S SIMULATED A COLLEAGUE OF MINE FROM A SURGEON DOCTORS LANGWORTH ACOBS TO CONVENE A NATIONAL PANEL TO ADDRESS INJURY THAT HE WITNESSED FROM THAT TERRIBLE OF- TO DETAIN THE STOP THE BLEED PROGRAM. IS THAT IT WAS DEVELOPED BY THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS COMMITTEE ON TRAUMA AND ADOPTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND SUPPORTED BY HOMELAND SECURITY AND ENCOURAGE EACH OF YOU TO LEARN MORE.

THE PROGRAM EVEN MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO FACE LIFE WITH MINIMAL AND RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT THAT WILL BE IT THAT ONE AVAILABLE WILL SAVE LIVES. DISAPPOINTMENT INCLUDE SIMPLY BECAUSE THE PROPER GLOVES TOURNIQUETS CAN SIMPLE INSTRUCTION. HELLO KIDDING DIFFICULT NOW WITH EIGHTIES AND PUBLIC BUILDINGS AT PATH REALLY PREVIOUSLY IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN BY SB SIX FIFTY EIGHT MAKE LOGICAL SENSE.

T. EACH TIME THAT I AM ON FALL AS I WAS THE PAST WEEKEND. LIVE DAYS BY BLEEDING CONTROL TECHNIQUES THAT ALLOW PATIENTS THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENTED TO THE HOSPITAL FOR DEFINITIVE TREATMENT AND FOR OTHER TO ARRIVE WITH MUCH LESS FLOOD WATER. THAN OTHERWISE. A TRAUMA VICTIM CAN BLEED TO DEATH WITHIN FIVE MINUTES. AND FOR MINIMAL COST IN MONETARY FUNDS AS WELL AS EDUCATION LINE. CAN AND WILL BE STATE. IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO LEAD IN THIS IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURE YET COMBINED LEADERSHIP AT EFFORTS WITH. EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES TRAUMA SURGERY EMERGENCY MEDICINE NURSING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH BUILDING A PROPERTY INDUSTRY. OTHER STATES SUCH AS GEORGIA HAVE ALREADY PASSED LEGISLATION BUT THIS WOULD REALLY BE IMPORTANT FOR CALIFORNIA.

THAT WE ARE- MISS SENT WE HAVE A WE A BILL FOR SENATOR WHO WOULD TO COME IN PERCENT ON THEIR BILLS. AND HE. BY THE SENATOR ALAN HI MARIA. HI THERE MISTER CHAIR YOU KNOW SHE RAN DOWN HERE BECAUSE ALL COMBINE OUR ECONOMY. NO YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT SHE HAS FOR BILLS. THIS WILL BE QUICK I'M JUST SAYING I'M JUST SAYING YEAH I. THOMAS WILL MAKE THIS QUICK- LET ME START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO DETAIL ON PAGE SEVEN. I THE HOSPICE MOVEMENT AND ITS INTEGRATION INTO WESTERN MEDICINE IS AN UPLIFTING STORY ABOUT COMPASSION. AND ABOUT THE BEST INSTINCTS OF HUMANITY EMBRACING THE MISSION OF PROVIDING COMFORT AND SOLACE. TO THOSE AMONG US WHO ARE DYING. HOWEVER MEDIA REPORTS AND GOVERNMENT SURVEY SUGGESTS THE LACK OF OVERSIGHT HAS LED TO UNSCRUPULOUS BUSINESSES ENTERING THE FIELD FOCUS MORE IN PROFIT AND PAIN MANAGEMENT. CALIFORNIA HAS THE HIGHEST RATE OF FOR PROFIT HOSPICES IN THE NATION AT NINETY ONE POINT TWO. PERCENT FOR PRIVATE HOSPICE LICENSORS IN OUR STATE OF RISEN DRAMATICALLY IN RECENT YEARS ESPECIALLY THROUGHOUT LOS ANGELES COUNTY. WHERE THERE ARE EXPONENTIALLY MORE HOSPICE PROVIDERS PER CAPITA THAN ANYWHERE UNITED STATES. THERE WAS A FASCINATING. AND VERY- TROUBLING EXPOSE IN THE LOS ANGELES TIMES AND IF YOU HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO READ IT MEMBERS WE HAVE COPIES LOVE TO. SHARE WITH YOU. AND THE EXPOSE SUGGESTS THAT- THIS BOOM HAS QUOTE SPAWNED A COTTAGE INDUSTRY OF ILLEGAL PRACTICES. ARE THERE WAS A SIMILAR INVESTIGATION DONE BY THE SACRAMENTO BEE WE CAN ALSO PROVIDE YOU COPIES. AND IT FOUND THE CALIFORNIA HOSPICES THEM AT TO BE MARRED BY LAX OVERSIGHT AND INABILITY OF REGULATORS TO TAKE MEANINGFUL ACTION AGAINST HOSPICES. THAT MAY HAVE VIOLATED RULES AND JEOPARDIZE THE HEALTH OF PATIENTS. THE INSPECTOR GENERAL FOUND THAT OVER NINETY PERCENT. OF CALIFORNIA HOSPICES ARE VIOLATING FEDERAL GUIDELINES. SO IT'S MY STRONG BELIEF THAT WE NEED TO A THOROUGHLY EXAMINE THESE ALLEGATIONS IN AN EXPLORATION OF PATHWAYS FOR POSSIBLE REFORM OF HOSPICE LICENSURE AND OVERSIGHT FRAMEWORK. I WITH THAT IN MIND THE JOINT LIST OF AUDIT COMMITTEE APPROVE MY AUDIT REQUEST THAT PROPOSES AN EXAMINATION OF THESE ALLEGATIONS AN EXPLORATION OF PATHWAYS FOR POSSIBLE REFORM REFORM OF THE HOSPICE LICENSOR IN OVERSIGHT FRAMEWORK- THIS BILL. BASICALLY BECAUSE CALLS FOR A PAUSE UNTIL. WE GET THE- DATA AND RECOMMENDATIONS BACK FROM THE AUDITOR. IT'S RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN THE SENATE AS DID THE AUDIT REQUEST. WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOSPICE AND PALLIATIVE CARE ASSOCIATION ON THIS MEASURE IN THE AUDIT WE APPRECIATE THEIR FEEDBACK AND HELP AND- THEY REMAIN NEUTRAL ON THE BILL- WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS TONY TICKET TELL FROM THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FOR NURSING HOME REFORM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE WILL GO AHEAD TO THE- PHONE LINES FOR A WITNESS ARE PROPER WINDOWS IN SUPPORT PLEASE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. YES GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE CHAIRED STAFF MEMBERS MY NAME'S TONY CHECK ITSELF I'M A STAFF ATTORNEY WITH CALIFORNIA BECAUSE FOR NURSING HOME REFORM. THE HOSPICE MOVEMENT BEGAN IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES REALLY TO CAPTURE A PHILOSOPHY A KID THAT WAS HIGHLY PATIENT DRIVEN. WITH A SINGULAR FOCUS ON PATIENT COMFORT- BUT ONCE THE HOSPICE CARE WAS INTRODUCED AS A MEDICARE BENEFIT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE AND- COMPOUNDED BY DECADES OF MOSTLY REGULATORY INDIFFERENCE THE HOSPICE PHILOSOPHY HAS BEEN PRETTY MANGLED. BY AN INCREASING NUMBER OF HOSPICE PROVIDERS WHO HAVE VERY LITTLE INTEREST IN PATIENT COMFORT BUT ARE DRIVEN INSTEAD BY EASY MONEY. AND ON WAITING FAMILIES. AS SENATOR ALAN REFERENCE THE RECENT LA TIMES INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT CALIFORNIA'S REALLY AN EPICENTER FOR HOSPICE FRAUD AND ABUSE. THE REPORT THAT INTENSE COMPETITION FOR LUCRATIVE MEDICARE PAYMENTS HISPANA COTTAGE INDUSTRY OF ILLEGAL PRACTICES AND ATTRACTED OPERATORS WHO ARE ENGAGED AND- AUDACIOUS AND WIDESPREAD FRAUD. MOST ALARMINGLY THE TIMES FOUND HUNDREDS OF INSTANCES IN WHICH CALIFORNIA HOSPICE PATIENTS WERE HARMED. NEGLECTED ARE PUT AT SERIOUS RISK. THE EXPONENTIAL BOOM IN PROVIDERS HAS TRANSFORMED END OF LIFE CARE THAT WAS ONCE THE REALM OF CHARITIES AND RELIGIOUS GROUPS INTO A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR BUSINESS DOMINATED BY PRIVATE. PROFIT DRIVEN OPERATORS. MANY THE FOR PROFIT OPERATORS RELENTLESSLY PURSUE PATIENTS AND ENGAGE IN FRAUD KICKBACKS AND WITHHOLDING OF CARE TO MEET THE GOALS OF ADMINISTRATORS AND INVESTORS. THERE ARE CERTAINLY GOOD HOSPICE PROVIDERS OUT THERE DOING AMAZING WORK IN VERY DIFFICULT TIMES. THEY LIKE MANY HOSPICE PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE UPSET IN THE WILDER BY THE PROLIFERATION OF FLY BY NIGHT HOSPICE AGENCIES. THE PROPOSED MORATORIUM IN SB SIX SIX FOUR WILL GIVE A MUCH NEEDED BREATHER TO THE STATE ALLOWING POLICY MAKERS AND ESPECIALLY THE STATE AUDITOR. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE ORIGINS OF THE HOSTAGE PROBLEMS AND TO DEVISE SOLUTIONS. CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE DYING DESERVE FAR BETTER THAN TO BE EXPLOITED BY CORRUPT HOSPICE PROVIDERS. WE URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS MORATORIUM THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THERE ANYONE IN THE GALLERY TO SEE TESTIFYING THIS. SEEING NO ONE WILL GO TO THE PHONE LINES WILL JUST BE ASKING FOR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION- JUST YOUR NAME POSITION ON THE BILL AN ORGANIZATION IF YOU REPRESENT ONE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.

PLEASE GO AHEAD GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS ARE THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE CURRENT COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS BEEN CHALLENGING FOR EVERYONE ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO MENTAL HEALTH EXPERTS HAVE WARNED THAT THIS PANDEMIC IS A TRAUMATIC STRESS STRAIN THAT IT COULD LEAD TO A WHOLE GENERATION OF CHILDREN WHO SUFFER FROM TRAUMA OR DEVELOP LONG TERM HEALTH ISSUES AS A RESULT OF ADVERSE. CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES. HOW THEN HOW DO WE ADDRESS THIS WAVE OF MENTAL AND FUTURE PHYSICAL HEALTH IN. THE CONTEXT OF THE TRAUMA THAT WERE ALL EXPERIENCING TODAY. SB FOUR TO EIGHT EXPENSE THE ABILITY OF PROVIDERS TO SCREEN PATIENTS FOR ASUS. IT REQUIRES A COMMERCIAL INSURANCE TO REIMBURSE PROVIDERS WHO PREFER ASUS SCREENS ALLOWING EVERYONE TO GET THIS VITAL SERVICE REGARDLESS OF INSURANCE COVERAGE. THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES CURRENTLY REIMBURSES POSITIONS WOULD TAKE ACES TRAINING AND PROVIDES ASUS SCREENS TO MEDICAL BENEFICIARIES. THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT FOR COMMERCIAL PAYERS TO DO THE SAME. MY EXPANDING COVERAGE OF ACES GREENS FOR ALL REGARDLESS OF INSURANCE COVERAGE DOCTORS CAN HELP IDENTIFY FACTORS CAUSED BY THE PANDEMIC AND OTHER EXPENSES THAT MAY LEAD TO WORSE HEALTH OUTCOMES IN THE FUTURE. I HAVE TWO WITNESSES TODAY JOINING US REMOTELY AS WELL AS TWO INDIVIDUALS AVAILABLE FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ALSO JOINING US REMOTELY- AND I HAVE WITNESSED DR.

WE ARE NOT JUST SCREENING FOR PNEUMONIA WHICH WILL REQUIRE A SIMPLE TEN DAY ANTIBIOTIC PRESCRIPTION FOR TREATMENT WE ARE SCREENING FOR ARRESTED THAT WILL HAVE A LIFETIME IMPACT AND OUTCOME FOR THAT PERSON TO HELP. SB FOUR TWENTY EIGHT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO RECOGNIZE EARLY RISK AND CHANGE TRAJECTORY. FOR A CHILD AND THE SUBSEQUENT GENERATION. THIRTY POINTS TO MAKE AT THE POSITION. SCREENING PATIENTS IS WHERE ALL THE MEDICINE AND FINANCES MOVING AS WE SEEK TO GET TREATMENT TO PATIENTS. IF WE DO NOT KNOW WE CANNOT REAT PHYSICIANS WANT TO TAKE THE FIRST STEP TO SCREEN. THE SECOND TREATMENT. ALL TREATMENT WHETHER IT IS A REFERRAL TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONNECTIONS SPECIAL EDUCATION PATHWAY FOR MEDICATION GIVEN TO AVOID. THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE GENETIC RISK ALL THE TREATMENT CHANGE OUT. OUR JOB IS TO PULL PREVENTIVE CARE OR EARLY INTERVENTION INTO THE CLINIC ROOM. WITH OUR PATIENTS AND FAMILIES THE TREATMENT IS TAILORED TO IDENTIFY RISK. PHYSICIANS ARE TRYING TO TAKE THAT SECOND STEP WHICH IS TO TREAT AND CONNECT RESOURCE. THERE IS A MISCONCEPTION THAT ONLY CHILDREN FROM POOR COMMUNITIES NEED SCREENING INTERVENTION EVERY PHYSICIAN KNOWS THIS IS A FALSE SAFETY CORNER. WERE. HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES WANT TO CONGREGATE.

AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK MY NAME IS DR CATHOLIC AT THE MAN AND I AM AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR IN THE DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE SCIENCES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO. AS A GENERAL INTERNIST AND PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER WITH EXPERTISE IN FAMILY PLANNING AND CONTRACEPTION I WITNESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF ACCESS TO CONTRACEPTION ON MY PATIENTS. PATIENT SHARE WITH ME HOW CONTRACEPTION HELPED THEM TO PLAN THEIR LIVES AND ALLOWS THEM TO DECIDE IF AND WHEN THEY WILL HAVE CHILDREN. BY BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT AND ACCESS TO CONTRACEPTION IF IT IF DESIRED I KNOW THAT I CAN HELP TO ENSURE THAT MY PATIENT NOT ONLY HAS BODILY AUTONOMY I CAN MAKE DECISIONS THAT ARE BEST FOR THEM JUST BECAUSE I WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO DO. ALL ASPECTS OF THEIR HEALTHCARE. WE KNOW FROM DECADES OF RESEARCH INTHE FIELD THAT NOT EVERY CONTRACEPTIVE. METHOD IS RIGHT FOR EVERY PERSON. THE CHOICE END OF. HOWEVER WE ALSO KNOW THAT PEOPLE IN OUR STATE AND IN OUR COUNTRY DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO ALL OF THE CONTRACEPTIVE METHODS THAT THEY NEED A BUYER. THE TYPICALLY PEOPLE THAT BEACON EQUITIES WHEN ACCESSING ANY HEALTHCARE INCLUDING BLACK INDIGENOUS AND OTHER PEOPLE OF COLOR. YOUNG AND ADOLESCENT PATIENTS. PATIENT EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THOSE WITH LOW INCOMES AND PEOPLE LIVING IN RURAL RURAL COMMUNITIES. EXPERIENCE VERY BARRIERS TO GETTING THE CONTRACEPTIVE METHODS THAT THEY DESIRE. SB FIVE TWENTY THREE WOULD ENSURE THAT PATIENTS ARE ABLE TO ACCESS INTERCEPTED CARE WHICH IS ESSENTIAL HEALTH CARE. REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY HAPPEN TO LIVE HOW MUCH MONEY THEY MAKE THEIR GENDER IDENTITY OR RACE OR ETHNICITY. IT WOULD EXPAND HEALTH CARE TO PROVIDE CONTRACEPTIVE COVERAGE BENEFITS TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN OUR STATE. THE FULL RANGE OF CONTRACEPTIVE METHODS WOULD BE COVERED AND OVER THE COUNTER BIRTH CONTROL METHODS COULD BE DISPENSED AT PHARMACIES DIRECTLY TO PATIENTS. REDUCING THE LIMITATIONS ON ACCESS AND ENSURING THAT PATIENTS HAVE TIMELY ACCESS TO ESSENTIAL HEALTH CARE. BILL IS TIMELY AS WE EMERGE FROM THE PANDEMIC HAVING SEEN THE DISPARITIES THAT WERE EXACERBATED DURING THE COPA NINETEEN PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. AND A REPORT WITH A NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE BY THE GUTTMACHER INSTITUTE. 38% OF BLACK WOMEN 45% OF LATINOS AND REPORTED EXPERIENCINGDELAYS ARE BEING UNABLE TO GET CONTRACEPTIVE CARE BECAUSE THE PANDEMIC. CALIFORNIA HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND OUR CONTRACEPTIVE COVERAGE COVERAGE IN A TIME WHEN PATIENTS WILL NEED IT THE MOST. AS A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN I SEE EVERY DAY THE IMPACT THAT BARRIERS TO AND DELAYS IN CARE CAN HAVE ON ONE'S LIFE. AND HEALTH OUTCOMES. SB FIVE TWENTY THREE WERE TAKEN IMPORTANT STEPS TO ENSURE THAT CONTRACEPTIVE CARE IN OUR STATE BECOMES MORE EQUITABLE AND ACCESSIBLE. FOR ALL THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION AND NANCY PFEFFER DIRECTOR OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FROM LIKELY GOT A LOT OF US A- THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WILL GO AHEAD AND MOVE TO OUR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT- OPERATOR PLEASE OPEN THE LINE FOR WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. YOU'RE A MARTIN WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION A PROUD CO SPONSOR AT THE TWO NINETY THREE. LAWMAKERS RECENTLY ALLOCATED OVER FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN THE STATE BUDGET TO HELP EXPAND ACCESS TO CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. BUT NONE OF THOSE DOLLARS WILL RESULT IN INCREASED ACCESS FOR CHILDREN IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM IN THE NEAR TERM IF THERE AREN'T ENOUGH PROVIDE YOU CAN ASSIST THEM WITH THE BANDWIDTH TO SERVE THEM. EDUCATING AND TRAINING THE NEXT GENERATION OF PROVIDERS WILL TAKE TIME TO IMMEDIATELY CREATE ACCESS TO THE SERVICES WE MUST FORGET THE CAPACITY OF THE EXISTING PROVIDERS. AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE CLINICAL THERE LERATO WILL EXPLAIN IN MORE DETAIL THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS TO MAKE AGGRESSIVE CHANGES TO THE CURRENT COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH DOCUMENTATION. REQUIREMENTS FOR CHILDREN SERVICES. BOB ADMINISTRATION IS TAKING CONCERN. AND HAVE BECOME TO TAKE OUT TO ADDRESS THE TROOPS. WE BELIEVE THAT EFFORT NEEDS TO GO MUCH FURTHER IF WE WANT TO ENSURE CHILDREN WHO NEED. URGENTLY CANNOT CUT THROUGH THE CRACKS. CALLUNA FOCUSED ON UNTANGLING WHAT DOCUMENTATION SHOULD BE REQUIRED FOR DETERMINING THE QUALITY OF CARE PROVIDED VERSUS THE REIMBURSEMENT. UPDATING STATE AUDITING GUIDELINES AND EDUCATING COUNTY FOR ABOUT WHAT THE LAW REQUIRES. THERE IS NO STATED INTENT REQUIRE COUNTY TO LIMIT THEIR DOCUMENTATION THE ONLY THE REQUIRED ELEMENTS. SIMILARLY NO PLANETS AND SET FORTH TO ADDRESS THE NEED TO STREAMLINE INTAKE ASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT PLAN DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS. SOME OF THE MOST BURDENSOME. PAPERWORK PROVIDER MUST COMPLETE. SB THREE NINETY THREE DIRECTLY ADMINISTRATION TO ADDRESS THE SHORTCOMINGS BY PACIFIC REQUIRING THE STATE TO ADDRESS INTAKE ASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT PLANNING DOCUMENTATION. REQUIRING COUNTY TO LIMIT THEIR PAPERWORK REQUIREMENTS ONLY WHAT IS NEEDED TO ENSURE THE QUALITY OF CARE PROVIDED AND COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL AND STATE LAW. AND STANDARDIZING KEEP PEOPLE WORK TO ENSURE THAT THE BURDEN OF PROVIDERS AND MEANINGFULLY REDUCE. WITHOUT THESE ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS CHILDREN WILL CONTINUE TO GO ON FOR TWO OTHERWISE COULD BE FOR WORK NOT FOR THE TIME IT TAKES TO COMPLETE THE FORM. THE COUNTY THEY HAVE A HOPE DIRECTORS ASSERT THAT IF THIS IS NECESSARY IT SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO MANAGED CARE PLAN. BUT WE BELIEVE THIS ARGUMENT AS A DISTRACTION MANAGED CARE PLAN COUNTY THEY'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE THINGS THAT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR STANDARDIZING THEIR FORMS WOULD REQUIRE A COMPLETELY SEPARATE EFFORT FROM THE FUNDS. IN ADDITION MOST PROVIDERS WORK WITH MANY MORE COUNTY SAN MANAGED CARE PLANS TO THE AMOUNT OF VARIATION AMONG COUNTIES REPRESENTS A MUCH GREATER BURDEN. FINALLY OUR MEMBERS HAVE TOLD US CLEARLY THAT THE PAPERWORK BURDEN AT THE FEET OF THE COUNTY. COUNTY CHILDREN'S BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES IS MUCH GREATER THAN THE PAPERWORK OF FIFTEEN OF WHICH WERE LATEST SERVICES PROVIDED THROUGH MEDICAID MANAGED CARE. FOR ALL THESE REASONS WE SHOULD BE TACKLING COUNTY. BEHAVIORAL PAPERWORK FIRST AND FOREMOST. IN FACT TO YOUR THE COUNTY ACTUALLY. OUR TO THE- STANDARDIZATION OF THE PAPER. BUT TODAY THEY WANTED TO WAIT AND SEE IF TELLING WILL GO FAR ENOUGH. OUR CHILDREN CAN'T AFFORD TO WAIT NOR CAN I AFFORD FOR US TO ONLY PARTIALLY ADDRESSED THE PROBLEM. THAT WE WANT TO TRULY FREE UP NOT ACCOUNT CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS TIME TO DO WHAT THEY DO BEST. AND MAXIMIZE ACTIVITIES INVALUABLE SERVICES AT THIS CRITICAL TIME THE EFFORT NEEDS TO GO MUCH FURTHER THAN IT CURRENTLY BEING PROPOSED AS PART OF TELLING FOR THESE REASONS WE URGE YOU TO SUPPORT SB TWO NINETY THREE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MOVE ONTO OUR NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS NANCY. URGENCY IN INCREASING ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH CARE FOR OUR LOW INCOME INFANTS CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS AND ARE FOSTER USE COVERED BY MEDICAID. I'M THE DIRECTOR OF A HAVE A HOLD. DEVATHA IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. WE OPERATE TWO. EPS T. T. PROGRAMS IN TWO DIFFERENT COUNTIES. AND THEY'RE IDENTICAL PROGRAMS BUT THE DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY IN EACH COUNTY. RESULTING IN THE NEED TO RUN TWO PARALLEL DISTINCT PROGRAMS WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY INEFFICIENT DUPLICATE SCARCE RESOURCES. MOST IMPORTANTLY REDUCES AVAILABLE STAFFING WHICH WE NEED FOR DIRECT SERVICES PROVIDING TREATMENT TO CHILDREN. AND ADOLESCENTS IN ORDER TO PROGRAM SERVING THE SAME CRIME POPULATIONS IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. SUPERVISORY STOPPING. LIMITING THE STAFFING WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE RESULT IN BETTER ACCESS IF WE COULD STREAMLINE ACROSS THE. COUNTIES RATHER THAN DUPLICATE. OF COURSE THE IMPACT OF THE PANDA. IS EVEN BECAUSE AND DEMAND- AND THEN EVER AND SYMPTOMS. SEVERITY WHICH GROW. EACH DAY AND WE'RE STRUGGLING TO MEET THE NEEDS YET OUR THERAPISTS SPEND 3240% OF THEIR TIME ON DOCUMENTATION THIS BURDEN LOWER STAFF MORALE INCREASES TURNOVER ENOUGH TO PLEASE HER SCARCE CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY COMPETENT WORK FORCE. LIKELY TO GO ALONE NOW HAS THIRTEEN THERAPIST VACANCY POSITION VACANT POSITIONS THIS ISN'T UNIQUE TO US. EACH THEIR TEST WE LOOSEN SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH IS A SIGNIFICANT LOSS AND CAN TAKE YEARS TO REPLACE REDUCTION IN WORKFORCE RESULTS IN RESTRICTED ACCESS TO CARE. FOR THE THIRD DISTRICT STATE TIME HOUSTON DOCUMENTATION THAT DOESN'T HAVE QUALITY OR ACCOUNTABILITY REDUCES ACCESS TO CARE IN IN IN SOME VACANCIES TURNOVER DUPLICATION DISPROPORTIONATE TIME SPENT ON DOCUMENTATION ALL REDUCES ACCESS AT A TIME WHEN. THE DEMAND FOR CARE IS HIGHER THAN EVER. MY PRESS LES PRESSED. ADVOCATED FOR DOCUMENTATION REDUCTION FOR A DECADE SHE DIED ALMOST THREE AND A HALF YEARS AGO WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT. AS LESLIE WOULD SAY LET'S PROVIDE CARE FOR THE PATIENT NOT THE CHART. AND NOW THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC IS TREMENDOUS WE'VE NEVER SEEN ACUITY LIKE THIS AMONG CHILDREN WE'VE NEVER HAD AS MANY REFERRALS ACTION IS NEEDED NOW STANDARDIZATION OF DOCUMENTATION WOULD GO A VERY LONG WAY. LET'S NOT WAIT ANY LONGER TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO OUR MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN I ASKED FOR HER AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE DO HAVE A WITNESS AND REGISTER WITNESS IN OPPOSITION SO PLEASE- GO AHEAD WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON SHERMAN WAY THEN COMMITTEE MEMBERS A SENSE HOLLOW WELL HOME AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE THIS PERSPECTIVE ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTOR AT THE SITUATION. TODAY WE ARE SHARING OUR CONCERNS WITHOUT SPEAKING NINETY THREE WE HAVE CONTINUED TO COMMUNICATE CONCERNS RATHER THAN OPPOSE THE BILL BECAUSE WE BELIEVE WE SHARE IMPORTANT OVER ARCHING GOALS WITH THE AUTHOR AND PROPONENT. ALONG WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLANS HAVE CONSISTENTLY ADVOCATED SIMPLIFY AND STREAMLINE DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS FOR MEDICAL SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. HOWEVER WE ARE UNABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM BECAUSE WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE STANDARDIZED FORMS PROPOSED IN SB TWO NINETY THREE WILL BE NEEDED. ONE FOR STATE HAS FULLY IMPLEMENTED THE SIGNIFICANT DOCUMENTATION OR FARMS PROPOSED IN THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCING AND INNOVATING MEDIC HOW INITIATIVE ARE COUNTING. UNDER CALTRAIN DHS PROPOSES TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO COMPLETELY TRANSFORM THE WAY ESPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE DOCUMENTED AND CLAIMS. CREDIT PREVIOUS REFORMS SHOULD ALIGN CLAIMING DOCUMENTATION AND COMPLIANCE STANDARDS FOR SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WITH RULES THAT EXIST ELSEWHERE IN MEDIC HOUSE AND AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE. IN CONTRAST SB TWO NINETY THREE WOULD CREATE A NEW AND DIFFERENT STANDARDS THAT WOULD BE APPLIED ONLY TO SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH EPA-EFE Q. SERVICES. THE BILL WOULD REPLACE THE CURRENT APPROACH TO SPECIALTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DOCUMENTATION WHICH PROVIDERS AND COUNTY ALIKE FIND OVERLY PRESCRIPTIVE AND COMPLIANCE ORIENTED. WITH EQUALLY PRESCRIPTIVES AND UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS FOR DH CS GROUP FORMED. TO OUR KNOWLEDGE THIS SORT OF REQUIREMENT DID NOT EXIST ANYWHERE ELSE WITHIN MEDICARE MANAGED CARE AT THIS TIME. INSTEAD OF CREATING FORMS SPECIFIC TO SPECIAL EMAIL HEALTHY PFPT SERVICES WE SUGGEST THEY WOULD BENEFIT CLIENTS PROVIDERS AND PLANS- LIKE TO ALIGN SPECIALTY LITTLE HEALTHY PST T. REQUIREMENTS WITH THOSE FOR OTHER BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND EAP PFPT SERVICES. ELSEWHERE IN MEDIC CAL THE STATE REQUIRES A SIMPLE SET OF MINIMAL DATA ELEMENTS TO BE DOCUMENTED IN REPORTING FOR BILLING AND COMPLIANCE. BEYOND IS ELEMENT SPEECH YES PERMITS EACH CLIENT NEEDS AND EACH PROVIDER'S EXPERTISE TO INFORM AND SHAPE THE WAY. A CLINICAL INTERACTION THAT DOCUMENTED. FOR THE REASONS WE CAN K. TO WRAP THAT IN THE VIEW OF THE- PROPOSED IN TWO NINETY THREE. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH STAKEHOLDERS SHOULD FIRST FOCUS ON SHAPING IN IMPLEMENTING THE FUNDAMENTALLY REFORMS ALREADY PROTESTING CALLIN. WE CAN MANIFEST WHETHER TELLING HIS HELP BALLPARK SYSTEMIC DOCUMENTATION CHALLENGES AND DECIDE IF ADDITIONAL CHANGES ARE STILL NEED IT. I PRESCRIBED IN AB ONE THIRTY THREE BUDGET TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE EACH THE AUTHORITY INITIATED THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS TO COORDINATE IMPORTANT WORK ON DOCUMENTATION REFORM. WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT PROCESS CAN BE USED TO DEVELOP A SINGLE SET OF ATTRACTIVE AND STREAMLINED STANDARDS FOR SPECIALTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. WE SUGGEST THIS WILL BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE PATH TO ALLEVIATE THE EXCESSIVE DOCUMENTATION BURDEN THAT WE ALL AGREE HAS HARM TECH. WHAT RESISTANCE IN THE PAST. SO I WILL PUT BY WE AND SPONSOR FOR THE TWO. TODAY AND FOR THEIR OF TO CONSENSUS ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I CAN ABOUT OUR CONCERNS.

AND ALSO ALLOWS FOR MORE TRANSPARENCY FROM HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS AT WITH US TODAY ON THE PHONE WE HAVE JANET DOUGLAS FROM HEALTH ACCESS AND JIM FLURRY FROM WESTERN LAW CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE GOOD OR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT ON THE PHONE. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE SPANISH OUTLETS FOR HEALTH ACTIVE CALIFORNIA THE STATEWIDE HEALTH CARE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION. SPONSORSHIP OF SB THREE SIXTY EIGHT. ALMOST TEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS HAVE DEDUCTIBLES MANY OF WHICH ARE IN THE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ON TOP OF THAT'S ALL CALIFORNIANS WITH PRIVATE COVERAGE HAVE MAXIMUM OUT OF POCKET LIMIT. FOR FAMILIES THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET OR FACING DIFFICULT EXPENSIVE MEDICAL CONDITIONS. TRACKING OR CRUEL TOWARD THESE AMOUNTS OF THE CRUCIAL PART OF FINANCIAL PLANNING AN ACT THE THING CARE. SB THREE SIXTY EIGHT WILL PLACE A BURDEN ON HEALTH PLAN TO UPDATE RELEASED UNDER CRUEL TOWARDS DEDUCTIBLES AND MAXIMUM OUT OF POCKET LIMITS FOR ANY MONTH. IN WHICH BENEFITS FOR YOU. A NEW FEDERAL RULES WILL REQUIRE PLAN SHARE THIS INFORMATION WITH CONSUMERS BUT FELL UNDER THE FEDERAL ROLE THE CONSUMER WOULD HAVE TO REQUEST THE INFORMATION. INSTEAD WE PROPOSE SHIFTING THE BURDEN FROM THE INDIVIDUAL TO THE HEALTH PLAN FOR THAT CONSUMER THINKING FACING SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEEDS AREN'T LEFT IN THE DARK. THIS IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH LANGUAGE BARRIERS OR- LACK FINANCIAL LITERACY. THE BURDEN SHOULDN'T FALL ON THAT THEY HAVE TO HUNT DOWN THE INFORMATION. SOMEONE RELEASED ALREADY RECEIVED YOUR FEES ARE EVIDENCE OF BENEFIT PAYMENTS WHICH INCLUDE THIS INFORMATION AND WE ALREADY KNOW THAT IT'S POSSIBLE BECAUSE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS PROVIDE THE UPDATE. WE APPRECIATE THE WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH PLANS ON AMENDMENTS WHICH INCLUDE CLARIFYING. THE BILL'S IMPLEMENTATION DELAYING IMPLEMENTATION UNTIL JULY TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND CLARIFYING THAT AND RELEASE OF OPTED INTO ELECTRONIC NOTIFICATIONS ALREADY. WILL ALSO RECEIVE THESE NOTICES ELECTRONICALLY WE DO BELIEVE THAT MALE NOTICES THAT THE DEFAULT ARE CRUCIAL TO MITIGATE EQUITY ISSUES FOR PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE HIGH SPEED INTERNET OR SMARTPHONE ACCESS HOWEVER WE APPRECIATE THE EASE OF ELECTRONIC NOTICE. FOR THOSE WHO OPTED TO NOT RECEIVE THE HARD COPIES. SB THREE SIXTY EIGHT WILL HELP CALIFORNIANS TRACTOR CRUEL TOWARDS THE DEDUCTIBLES AND OUT OF POCKET NEXT MONTH SO THAT THEY CAN BETTER MANAGE THEIR FAMILY FINANCESAND KEEP TRACK OF THEIR HELP FUNDING. FOR THESE REASONS WE'RE PROUD TO SPONSOR SB THREE SIXTY EIGHTRESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE THAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU. OUR NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. THERE ARE. POVERTY CAL. OLD AND LARGE LEGAL. WITH CENTER AND MEMBER OF THE YOU CAN RELY ON. CURRENT CONSUMERS ARE REQUIRED TO KEEP TRACK OF ALL THEIR HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES AND SELF CALCULATE WHEN THEY REACH THEIR DEDUCTIBLE OR OUT OF POCKET MAXIMUM- CAN EXPLAIN ALL THE COST SHARING REQUIRED WE CLICK REQUIREMENTS OF THEIR PLANS. WHEN CONSUMERS RECEIVE A BILL FROM A PROVIDER AT MANY ASSUME THEY- THE AMOUNT THEY'RE BUILT FOR RATHER THAN ADEQUATE THEY HAVE ALREADY ACCRUED TOWARD THEIR DEDUCTIBLE OUT OF POCKET MAXIMUM. THIS IS ASKING THOSE WITH THE LEAST KNOWLEDGE OF INDUSTRY PRACTICES AND TERMINOLOGY TO BE ABLE TO ADVOCATE FOR THEMSELVES. FURTHER MORE CONSUMERS ARE MOST LIKELY TO HIT THEIR DEDUCTIBLE OUT OF POCKET MAXIMUM WHEN THEY HAVE HAD A MAJOR HEALTH EVENTS. SUCH AS AN ACCIDENT REQUIRING EMERGENCY CARE OR A CANCER DIAGNOSIS. IN THOSE STRESSFUL TIMES KEEPING UP WITH ANY FINANCIAL MATTER IS A CHALLENGE THE ADDITIONAL BURDEN OF UNDERSTANDING HEALTH PLAN OR POLICY TERMS AND CONDITIONS IF MORE THAN MANY CONSUMERS CAN BEAR. IN ADDITION MANY LOW INCOME CONSUMERS ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR CREDIT AS HAVING BAD CREDIT AND LIMITED RESOURCES CAN MEAN LOSING OUT ON HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES. PAYING HIGHER INTEREST ONLY HAVING ACCESS TO SOME SUBPRIME PRODUCTS LIKE PAYDAY LOANS. IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR CONSUMERS TO PAY A BILL FOR PROVIDER EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT CERTAIN I THINK A LOT BILL BECAUSE THEY FEAR WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THEIR CREDIT. FOR LOW INCOME CONSUMERS EVEN IF THE OVER PAYMENT IS RETURNED BY THE PROVIDER WHICH CAN BE A REAL CHALLENGE BECAUSE PROVIDER OFFICES ARE NOT SET UP TO PAY PEOPLE. MONEY THAT IS TIED UP IN HEALT CARE BILLS MEAN OTHER BILLS ARE NOT PAID OR THEY FOREGO NEEDED SERVICES INCLUDING FUTURE MEDICAL CARE. FINALLY FOR CONSUMERS WHO HAVE MET THEIR DEDUCTIBLE OUT OF POCKET MAXIMUMS HERE IS LIKELY TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY CHEAPER FOR THEM FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR. IN THE CASE OF HITTING THEIR OUT OF POCKET MAXIMUM THE REST OF THE CARE THEY RECEIVE THAT YEARS FREE. HOWEVER WITHOUT THIS BEING COMMUNICATED THE CONSUMER MAY AVOID CARE ALTOGETHER PRECISELY THE TIME WHEN THEY MOST NEED IT AND WHEN HE DID FINALLY AFFORDABLE. SHE EVER INCREASING DEDUCTIBLES AND OUT OF POCKET MAXIMUMS TRAIN CONSUMERS NOT TO GET CARE WHEN THEY NEED IT. THEY SHOULD BE INFORMED WHEN IT IS MOST ADVANTAGEOUS FOR THEM TO GET CARE. BECAUSE THE HEALTH PLANNERS SURE WOULD RECEIVE INFORMATION FROM ALL OF THE PROVIDERS AND CONSUMERS SEE THEY'RE IN THE BEST POSITION TO TRACK HOW MUCH OF A DEDUCTIBLE OR AN OUT OF POCKET MAXIMUM. THAT A CONSUMER HAS ACCRUED. THEY ALSO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT SERVICES CAN BE APPLIED TO NEEDED IN RELIEF THE DUCK DOUBLE. I LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR CARRYING TO SELL. AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THE YOU VERY MUCH. WE WILL NOW MOVE TO WE HAVE TWO WITNESSES REGISTERED IN OPPOSITION- WILL MOVE TO THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ON THE PHONE LINE PLEASE.

THIS AMERICAN VERY FROM AS MUCH IN COURT PLEADINGS TO FEELING SOMETHING LONGER AT TIMES COUPLE MONTHS DEPENDING ON THE PATIENT'S HEALTH INSURANCE IN SOME CASES THE PATIENT NEVER SEEMS ABOUT MARKETERS BECAUSE THE POSITION DOESN'T HAVE THE STAFF.

UNFORTUNATELY UNFORTUNATELY WE KNOW THAT NOT EVERYONE IS SO LUCKY AND THAT IS WHY THE LEGISLATION THAT SOME IMPORTANT. ALL PATIENTS SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO TIMELY GUIDELINE BASED BIOMARKER TESTING REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY LIVE OR WHETHER THEY RECEIVE THEIR CARE AND A LARGE ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTRE OR IN THE SMALLER COMMUNITY SETTING. BIOMARKER TESTING IS STANDARD OF CARE FOR MANY TYPES OF CANCER AND IT SAVES LIVES. THIS BILL WILL HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY FAST AND DO NOT HAVE THE LUXURY TO WAIT FOR PRIOR AUTHORIZATION TO BE COMPLETED BEFORE. THEY RECEIVE BIOMARKER TESTING. BUT CALL GUIDELINE TO RECKON BY CAP THINGS LIKE. A TREATMENT OPTIONS. ANY THAT DELAYED BY MARKET. WILL WHEN A PERSON CONCERT THEIR INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT. I AUTHORIZATION FOR BIOMARKER TESTING HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CAUSE HARMFUL DELAYS FOR PATIENTS.

THANK YOU SENATOR WE'RE MOVING ON TO OUR FINAL ITEM OF THE DAY ITEM NUMBER SIXTEEN SB TWO TO ONE BY SENATOR WIENER. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY SIR. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN- CALLING SENATE BILL TWO TO ONE ESTABLISH A SERVICES CLEAR TIMELY ACCESS STANDARDS FOR FOLLOW UP CARE NEEDED BY PATIENTS- IN ORDER TO MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS- BY EXTENDING EXISTING REQUIREMENTS TO THOSE- TO PEOPLE WHO REQUIRE ON GOING CARE. ACT CURRENT TIMELY ACCESS REQUIREMENTS ADMINISTRATIVELY SPECIFY THAT APPOINTMENTS FOR MENTAL HEALTH OR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PROVIDER MUST OCCUR WITHIN TEN BUSINESS DAYS- BUT THEY DID NOT EXPLICITLY STATE THIS REQUIREMENT APPLIES BEYOND INITIAL APPOINTMENTS- THIS LEADS TO THE FRANKLY RIDICULOUS SITUATION WHERE SOMEONE WHO IS EXPERIENCING A MENTAL HEALTH. OR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PROBLEM IS ENTITLED TO A QUICK- TEN BUSINESS DAY INITIAL APPOINTMENT BUT THEN MAY HAVE TO WAIT THREE MONTHS FOR THEIR SECOND FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENT AND SO ON AND SO FORTH- WE KNOW. BECAUSE WE HAVE A CRISIS IN TERMS OF MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION IN THE STATE WE KNOW THAT YOU YOUR TREE AND YOUR ADDRESSES CRISIS BY THE END OF FOURTEEN PEOPLE ACCESS TO TREATMENT AND MAKING SURE THAT IT'S CONSISTENT AND TIMELY TREATMENT AND WE KNOW FROM PROVIDERS- THAT WHEN PEOPLE NEED THAT ONGOING CARE IT'S NOT OPTIONAL. LAST YEAR THIS COMMITTEE THANK YOU PASSED SENATE BILL EIGHT FIFTY FIVE TO ENSURE PARITY FOR MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT THE BASIC NOTION THAT MENTAL HEALTH IS NOT DIFFERENT THAN PHYSICAL HEALTH- YEAH WE CONTINUE TO TOLERATE- MENTAL HEALTH BEING TREATED DIFFERENTLY AND SOMEHOW NOT AS IMPORTANT WE WOULD NOT TOLERATE THESE KIND OF HUGE GAPS FOR PHYSICAL HEALTH HEALTH AND YET WE CONTINUE TO TOLERATE THEM. FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND NO WONDER WE HAVE A PROBLEM- I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT THIS BILL L. DOT DOES NOT MANDATE THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN APPOINTMENT- EVERY TEN BUSINESS DAYS IF YOUR PROVIDER THINGS THAT LONGER. IS THE APPROPRIATE COURSE OF THE PROVIDER THINGS THAT ONCE A MONTH IS OKAY FOR PARTICULAR DIAGNOSIS- THEY'RE NOT MANDATED TO DO IT EVERY TIME BUSINESS DAYS. IN ADDITION IF A PATIENT DOES NOT WANT TO COMMENT EVERY TEN BUSINESS DAYS THE HEALTH PLAN IS NOT GOING TO BE DOING. OFFER THAT- BUT WE BUT THIS DOES PROVIDE THE PRACTITIONERS WHO ARE THE EXPERTS THE ABILITY TO SET A SCHEDULE AND A REASONABLE- SCHEDULE. TIME SO ARE BECAUSE THIS IS A GOOD AN OVERDUE BILL I MAKES CLARIFICATIONS AND MAKES ABUNDANTLY CLEAR IN LAW THE TIMELY ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH CARE INCLUDING FOLLOW UP. APPOINTMENTS IS AN IMPORTANT GOAL OF THE STATE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR- I VOTE WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY. IF CHELSEA MARTINEZ A PATIENT DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY THIS LOOPHOLE AND SUSAN WHITNEY A LICENSED MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST WITH KAISER THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL GO TO THE GALLERY FIRST. TO OUR WITNESS WHO'S HERE IN PERSON. HI MY NAME IS CHELSEA MARTINEZ I'M FROM U. K. CALIFORNIA I MET THIRTY SIX YEAR OLD WIFE MOTHER OF TWO BOYS EIGHTEEN AND TUE AND HAVE A BABY ON THE WAY. I AM DIAGNOSED WITH MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER AND BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER. NOT TO MENTION ALL THE THINGS THAT FALL UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF THESE ILLNESSES. SUCH AS ADHD ANXIETY AND PANIC ATTACKS JUST TO NAME A FEW. I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH THESE THINGS WHEN I BECAME A PATIENT AT KAISER WHEN I WAS AROUND ABOUT TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD. AT KAISER FOR ONE ON ONE THERAPY I WOULD TYPICALLY WAIT SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS BETWEEN APPOINTMENTS SOMETIMES LONGER. WITH WEIGHTS THAT LONG I DID NOT GET BETTER. IN FACT IT MADE THINGS MUCH WORSE FOR ME. WHENEVER I WOULD MEET WITH A NEW THERAPIST AFTER SUCH A LONG BREAK. I WOULD HAVE TO RE INTRODUCE MYSELF AND MY STORY I'D HAVE TO RE OPEN MY WOUNDS EVERY TIME AND HAD NO GUIDANCE ON HOW TO KILL THEM. THE FIRST FORTY MINUTES WOULD BE TAKEN UP BY RE INTRODUCING MYSELF. THEN THERE WAS ALMOST NO TIME TO ADDRESS WHAT WAS HAPPENING CURRENTLY IN MY LIFE AND CERTAINLY NOT ENOUGH TIME TO HELP ME MANAGE ALL THE EMOTIONS. THAT I HAD HAD. FROM ALL THE TRAUMAS THAT I JUST REVISITED. AFTER THOSE SESSIONS MY FLASHBACKS BECAME MORE SEVERE I WOULD HAVE DISSOCIATIVE EPISODES LOSING TIME SOMETIMES HOURS SOMETIMES DAYS AT A TIME. DURING THIS TIME I STARTED KOMPLETT CONTEMPLATING SUICIDE AND I EVEN ATTEMPTED A FEW TIMES. HOW DO YOU SITE HOW DO YOU FIND THE WORDS TO SAY GOODBYE TO YOUR CHILD. WHEN I WAS THIRTY I STARTED PAYING OUT OF POCKET TO SEE A THERAPIST OUTSIDE OF KAISER. THIS CREATED AN EXTREME FINANCIAL HARDSHIP FOR ME AND MY FAMILY. HOWEVER SINCE THEN I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MEET WITH HIM AS OFTEN AS I NEED TO. IN THE FIRST SIX WEEKS OF AT LEAST WEEKLY THERAPY I IMPROVED MORE THAN IN THE SIX YEARS THAT I WAS AT KAISER. I HAVEN'T NEEDED WEEKLY TREATMENTS FOR SOME TIME BUT IF I EXPERIENCE ANY OF MY TRAUMA COMING BACK I CAN EASILY REACH OUT TO MY THERAPIST AND GET THE KIND OF CARE THAT. I NEED TO MOVE THROUGH IT. EVEN KNOWING THAT I HAVE ACCESS TO CARE WHEN I NEED IT MAKES ME CAPABLE OF DEALING WITH PROBLEMS THAT I OTHERWISE COULD NOT. I FEEL LESS AFRAID AND LESS HELPLESS. I AM EAGER AND ABLE TO MOVE ON WITH WHO I AM AND MORE COMPLICATE CONFIDENT IN NAVIGATING MY OWN LIFE AND THE LIVES OF MY CHILDREN. I AM CURRENTLY AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF MY COMMUNITY. I WORK HARD I CARE FOR MYSELF AND MY FAMILY. I'VE MADE STRONG HEALTHY AND BEAUTIFUL RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE THAT HAVE BECOME PILLARS. IN MY SUPPORT. THIS IS WHAT PROPER TREATMENT CAN DO FOR PEOPLE. THIS IS WHAT IT CAN LOOK LIKE. I THINK THAT PEOPLE OFTEN THINK OF MENTAL ILLNESS AS A SINGULAR INDIVIDUAL ISSUE WHEN THAT'S SIMPLY NOT THE CASE. MENTAL ILLNESS IS AN ISSUE THAT AFFECTS OUR CHILDREN AND THE TRAUMA THAT THEY MAY EXPERIENCE AS A DIRECT RESULT OF OUR OWN. IT AFFECTS OUR FAMILY UNITS OUR RELATIONSHIPS OUR JOBS AND IN TURN OUR COMMUNITY. AGAIN I CANNOT STRESS THAT THIS IS WHAT TRUMP PROPER TREATMENT CAN DO FOR PEOPLE. IT'S WHAT IT SHOULD DO FOR PEOPLE. WE DESERVE A CHANCE AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO THRIVE. WE ARE DESERVING OF PROPER MENTAL HEALTH CARE IN ANYTHING LESS THAN THAT IS SIMPLY IN HUMANE. THANK YOU FOR HEARING MY STORY AND WHY THIS BILL MEANS SO MUCH TO ME AND COUNTLESS OTHERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND ESPECIALLY THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE IN PERSON TO TELL YOUR STORY. WILL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. I BELIEVE SHE'S ON THE PHONE LINE. PARDON I BELIEVE SHE'S ON THE PHONE YES ON THE PHONE I'M SORRY I WASN'T YEAH TO THE OPERATOR PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON CAN YOU HEAR ME YES MA'AM PLEASE GO AHEAD. I'M STEVEN WHITNEY A LICENSED MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST AT KAISER BAKERSFIELD. I'VE WORKED FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS IN SOCIAL WORK IN IN TREATING PATIENTS WITH MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. OVER MY CAREER MOST PATIENTS I TREATED HAVE BEEN ENROLLED IN COMMERCIAL HEALTH PLANS THAT WOULD BE COVERED UNDER AT THE TWO TO ONE. EXPERIENCE MISS MARTINEZ JUST DESCRIBED IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT CLINICAL STUDIES TELL US ABOUT TREATMENT. OF MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES IN RESEARCH IT'S CLEAR. WHEN PATIENTS AREN'T SEEN FREQUENTLY ENOUGH THEY OFTEN DON'T GET BETTER. H. HAD WATER IN THEIR ILLNESSES SOMETIMES FOR YEARS. TOO OFTEN THEY GET WORSE WITH INCREASED MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY LONGER RECOVERY TIMES MORE MERGENCY ROOM TRIPS. MORE COSTLY CARE. THAT'S WHY THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION'S PRACTICE GUIDELINES RECOMMEND WEEKLY THERAPY FOR MANY COMMON DIAGNOSIS SUCH AS DEPRESSION AND POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER ESPECIALLY AT THE ONSET OF THE PATIENT'S CARE. HI THE MENTALLY WHEN PEOPLE RECEIVE TIMELY FOLLOW UP HERE MANY MAKE PROGRESS IN RELATIVELY SHORT TIME FRAME STABILIZE AND GRADUATE TO LESSEN TENSIONS TREATMENT. UNFORTUNATELY MANY PATIENTS DO NOT RECEIVE FREQUENT ENOUGH FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENT. IN MY CLINIC PATIENTS WITH DIAGNOSES LIKE DEPRESSION ANXIETY BI POLAR DISORDER AND PTSD TYPICALLY RATE FORTY EIGHT WEEKS OR MORE BETWEEN APPOINTMENTS. THIS IS TRUE ACROSS THE STATE AT KAISER CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST HMO. IT'S ONLY WORSENING DUE TO THE DRAMATIC INCREASE IN DEMAND PRODUCED BY THE PANDEMIC AND THAT. WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT TODAY WE'VE ALSO HEARD ABOUT ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES. WE ARE THOSE TO TREAT THOSE WHO NEED THE TREATMENT. PROTOCOL THAT EXIST IN CURRENT REGULATIONS AND DULY FOCUSES HELPCENTER TENSION ON TIMELY ACCESS TO INITIAL APPOINTMENT BUT NOT TO FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENT. HENCE THE PREDICTABLE RESULT ALREADY MENTIONED THAT HEALTH PLANS LIKE KAISER DON'T PRIORITIZE FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENTS. THAT'S WHY I STRONGLY SUPPORT SB TWO TO ONE. IF PASSED IT WILL HELP FOCUS HEALTH PLANS ON THE CRITICAL NEED FOR TIMELY FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENTS. THIS IS ESSENTIAL FOR INSURING THE CALIFORNIANS RECEIVE THE CARE THEY NEED. AND THE CARE THAT THEY HAVE PAID RECEIPT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO WE HAVE TO REGISTERED- WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION AN OVERLAP OPERATOR PLEASE ALLOW THOSE WITNESSES TO OPEN THEIR PHONE OR APPLE OPEN THE PHONE LINES FOR THOSE WITNESSES. INTERLINE SHOULD BE OPEN. A GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE A JACKHAMMER CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS REGRETTABLY WE ARE HERE OPPOSITION AT B. TWO TWENTY ONE I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHORED SPONSORS AND THE COMMITTEE STAFFER ENGAGING WITH UP ON THE CELL. I WANT TO START BY SAYING THAT WE DO APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF THE BILL AND AGREE THAT INSURING ACT AT THE TIME WHEN CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT CARE IS CRITICAL. HOWEVER WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE P. TWENTY ONE TAKES A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH TO SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT WITHIN TEN DAYS. AND DID NOT ADEQUATELY CONSIDER THE MANY CHALLENGES THAT THIS PROVISION ENTAILS. ARE TYPICALLY THE BILL DOES NOT ADEQUATELY CONSIDERED THE REASONS WHY A PATIENT MIGHT CHOOSE NOT TO HAVE A FOLLOW UP VISIT DEPENDING TIME FRAME. FOR EXAMPLE AN INDIVIDUAL MAY NOT FEEL LIKE PROVIDER WHO PERFORMED THE INITIAL ASSESSMENT WITH A GOOD DAY. AND WE PREFER AN APPOINTMENT WITH ANOTHER PROVIDER. OR AN INDIVIDUAL MAY INDICATE THAT THEY ON THEIR OWN PER SCHEDULE. BI WEEKLY OR MONTHLY SESSIONS ARE ADEQUATE. I WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED THAT THE MAY- COULD UNDER UNINTENTIONALLY UNDERMINE EXISTING PROVIDER NETWORK BY REQUIRING PLANTS TO ARRANGE FOR OUT OF NETWORK COVERAGE. IF THE CONTACT THE PROVIDER CAN NOT OPERATE CAN DAY FALL POINT MEANT. HOW PLANS WERE DILIGENTLY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE ROBUST NETWORK THAT MEETS THE NEEDS FOR THE MEMBERS. THE CONSIDERING IRMA'S CHARGE AT THIS BILL PLACES ON THE CONTRACT PROVIDERS GET THOUGHT AND A FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENT. THERE WOULD BE LITTLE INCENTIVE FOR PROVIDERS WHO CONTRACTED HEALTH PLANS IF THEY COULD PROVIDE THE SERVICES OUT OF NETWORK- LASTLY. AND MOST IMPORTANT IS YOUR CARE AND NUMBER WE LIVE AT THE TWENTY ONE ADEQUATELY CONSIDER. THE FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGE OF A LACK OF AVAILABLE WORKFORCE TO MEET THE CURRENT DEMAND FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. ALTHOUGH WE ARE ENCOURAGED TO SEE THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT MADE IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET BY THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION. RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A STRONG BEHAVIORAL WORKFORCE IN OUR STATE. CALIFORNIA STILL CURRENTLY FACING A MENTAL HEALTH CARE. WHILE WORKFORCE SHORTAGE ROUTE STATE. PRIOR TO COMPANY AND THEN. A UNIVERSITY OF. CAN BECAUSE FOUND OUT WITHOUT IT CONCERTED EFFORT TO RECRUIT RETAIN MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. CALIFORNIA HAS KNOW 30% YOUR THERAPIST THAT WE NEED TO MEET THE DEMAND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES BY TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT. THE COMPANY DEMICHELIS EXACERBATED THIS REPORT SHORTAGE AT THE NAMPA THESE SERVICES HAS. SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED. ASSEMBLY PART OF MANDATING INCREASED FREQUENCY OF APARTMENTS THAT ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING OR CORE SHORT WILL NOT LEAD TO INCREASE QUALITY CARE UT RATHER. LEASE PROVIDERS HAVING TO MANSER THE THING CASELOAD IN ORDER TO ENSURE NOT POSSIBILITY TO SCHEDULE ALL APPOINTMENTS. IN. THE TEN DAY TIME FRAME COSTA DEL. PLEASE RETURN. I BELIEVE QUESTION OF HONESTY TWENTY ONE THANK YOU THANK YOU- NEXT- WITNESS PLEASE. HM NUMBER SEVEN WHAT CAN FROM BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF OUR THOUGHTS AND CONCERNS WITH RESPECT SB THREE TWO ONE. BUT LIKE TO ECHO MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS AND I'LL SO HIGHLIGHTS FOR YOU OUR CONCERNS WITH RESPECT TO THE BILL SEEKING TO CODIFY A PORTION OF THE TIMELY ACCESS STANDARDS. BUT MANY OF YOU CAN APPRECIATE REGULATIONS ARE REALLY INTENDED TO GIVE LIFE THE STOCK STORY STRUCTURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE ENACT. THESE GUIDELINES ARE MORE LIKE LIVING BREATHING DOCUMENTS THAT. AS AN EXAMPLE TEAMMATES THESE EVALUATING RIGHT DURING THEIR CURRENT STATUTORY AND TIMELY ACCESS STANDARDS AS THE TV I SEVERAL YEARS AGO BUT THEY JUST INCORPORATE ADDITIONAL ACCESS STANDARDS WHICH WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND THE TRADITIONAL GEO ACTIVE STANDARDS THAT EXISTED. WE START TO CODIFY THE STANDARDS INTO LAW IT LIMITS THE OVERSIGHT FLEXIBILITY THAT REGULATORS CURRENTLY USED TO ADDRESS ISSUES AS THEY ARISE BY SIGNIFICANTLY HINDERING THEIR ABILITY TO BE NIMBLE AND ADDRESS OVERSIGHT ISSUES QUICKLY. AS THEY WOULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO COME AS A WOULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE ANY MODIFICATIONS NO MATTER HOW INSIGNIFICANT OUR TECHNICAL THEY MIGHT BE. JUST TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST YEAR A GREAT DEAL OF GROWTH IN THE TELL HEALTH SECTOR. WITH GROWTH COMES THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL REGULATORY OVERSIGHT THAT COULD BE HAMPERED IF THESE REGULATIONS WERE TO BE ADOPTED INTO STATUTE. SURELY AT THE ARTICLES TO ADD AND SPECIFIC STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENTS THEY CAN ACCOMPLISH THAT WITHOUT TYING HIM TO BREAK THE LATEST BY AND THIS. CODIFYING EXISTING ACCESS STANDARD. OR THE THREE. AND ONE PREVIOUSLY BY MY COLLEAGUE WE ARE BURKE IN OPPOSITION OF THE YOU VERY MUCH. WE WILL NOW GO TO THE FOR LINE.

AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOU I KNOW I RECOGNIZE WE DO HAVE WORKFORCE ISSUES- THAT THERE'S NO CHALLENGES A LACK OF PSYCHIATRISTS WE'VE ALSO YOU KNOW I'VE WORKED ON BILLS THAT ALLOWED FOR EXPANSION OF THE UTILIZATION OF OUR WORK FORCE TO BE ABLE TO ADEQUATELY. SERVE AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE FOR EXAMPLE MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST NOW CAN DO THE WORK THE SOCIAL WORKERS DO AT AND- AND SO ON WE ALSO HAVE NURSE PRACTITIONERS WHO WORK IN IN IN THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SPACE AS WELL SO THERE ARE THERE IS A WORK FORCE OUT THERE- AND- I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING MORE DISCOURAGING THAN TO GET THAT TIMELY ACCESS IN TEN DAYS AND THEN BE TOLD GONNA WAIT SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS FOR THE NEXT FOR THE NEXT APPOINTMENT HOW DISCOURAGES OUT FOR SOMEONE WHO. HAS A SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT THEY NEED TO HAVE A DRESS SO I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS GO FORWARD- IS MUCH APPRECIATED- LOOKING FOR A MOTION. JEFF GORDON A MICHIGAN KARIMA MOVED IT. SIX SEVEN BY MISTER FLOOR. WHICH I CLOSE. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN YOU- YOU KNOW ITS- IT'S INTERESTING WHEN THE OPPOSITION TALKS ABOUT ONE SIZE FITS ALL OF COURSE IT'S NOT ACCURATE FOR THE REASONS I STATED. EARLIER BECAUSE- PRACTITIONER CAN CRAFT WHATEVER PLAN THEY THINK APPROPRIATE THIS FOR THE BASELINE STANDARD IN PLACE AND I'LL BE HONEST I WISH WE DIDN'T HAVE TO HAVE BASELINE TIMELY ACCESS STANDARDS WHICH WE ALREADY HAVE BEEN AROUND PHYSICAL HEALTH AND INITIAL MENTAL HEALTH APPOINTMENTS I WISH WE NEED TO DO THAT. BUT THE SAD STATE OF AFFAIRS IS THAT WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO HAVE A RULE BECAUSE IT'S NOT HAPPENING- WITH THE PLANS. I AM IN TERMS OF THE SHORTAGE- YOU KNOW I THINK- I THINK THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES WITH THE WORK FORCE AND WE HAVE TO PROACTIVELY PLAN FOR THE FUTURE TO DRAW MORE PEOPLE AND FOR THIS IMPORTANT SPACE. I DO THINK THE OPPOSITION IS OVERSTATED THE SCALE- OF THAT OF THAT ISSUE AND THERE ARE STUDIES THAT SUGGEST THAT IT'S NOT AT THE LEVEL THAT THEY'RE SAYING SO THIS BILL IS IMPLEMENTABLE- WITH THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY- I THINK WE NEED TO COMPARTE- SEND OUT WELL OUT TO THE HEALTH PLANS- AND THIS BILL WOULD DO THAT AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.
