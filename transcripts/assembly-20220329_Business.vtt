PILFERING FROM MY MEDICINE

01:23:13.421 --> 01:23:14.756
CABINET MAINLY BECAUSE THERE

01:23:14.823 --> 01:23:16.858
WASN'T ANYTHING THERE. BACK THEN

01:23:16.925 --> 01:23:18.393

TO GO ELSEWHERE AND THEY DID.

01:23:27.535 --> 01:23:29.537
WHEN MY SON WAS ABOUT SEVENTEEN

01:23:29.604 --> 01:23:31.773

HIS FRIENDS HAD BEEN STEALING

01:23:32.474 --> 01:23:33.274
PILLS FROM THEIR PARENTS A

01:23:33.341 --> 01:23:35.276

01:23:35.343 --> 01:23:36.444
TRADING AND SELLING BACK AND

01:23:36.511 --> 01:23:39.114
FORTH. JOEL'S CONTRIBUTION WAS

01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:42.050
HIS OWN ATTAR ALL I HAD NO IDEA

01:23:42.117 --> 01:23:43.651
IT WAS A HOT TICKET ON THE

01:23:43.718 --> 01:23:45.353
ILLICIT MARKET. I DID

01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:47.055
CONVERSATIONS WITH ALL OF MY

01:23:47.122 --> 01:23:49.391
KIDS FROM THE AGE OF TEN AND UP

01:23:49.457 --> 01:23:51.526
ABOUT THE DANGERS OF ALCOHOL AND

01:23:51.593 --> 01:23:53.361
MARIJUANA I WAS A KID FROM THE

01:23:53.428 --> 01:23:55.663
SIXTIES. I NEVER EVEN CONSIDERED

01:23:55.730 --> 01:23:57.232
TALKING ABOUT PRESCRIPTION

01:23:57.298 --> 01:23:59.234
MEDICATIONS WHY DID THEY USE

01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:01.236
THESE DRUGS. BECAUSE IT WAS SO

01:24:01.302 --> 01:24:04.773
EASY TO GET PLAIN AND SIMPLE.

01:24:04.839 --> 01:24:06.207
GREG EXPERIMENTATION DOESN'T

01:24:06.274 --> 01:24:08.276
START WITH A NEEDLE IN THE VEIN

01:24:08.343 --> 01:24:10.345
IT STARTS WITH DRUGS THAT ARE IS

01:24:10.412 --> 01:24:11.513
EASY TO GET AS OPENING YOUR

01:24:11.579 --> 01:24:13.281
MOM'S MEDICINE CABINET. RESEARCH

01:24:13.348 --> 01:24:15.283

01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:16.451
ADDICTS BEGAN BY USING

01:24:16.518 --> 01:24:19.320
PRESCRIPTION. OPIOIDS WHAT IF

01:24:19.387 --> 01:24:20.522
THERE WAS A SAFEGUARD IN PLACE

01:24:20.588 --> 01:24:23.291
THAT MADE IT HARDER FOR THEM TO

01:24:23.358 --> 01:24:24.225
ACCESS WHAT IF THAT YOUNG PERSON

01:24:24.292 --> 01:24:26.494
HAD TO DO A REALLY QUICK RISK

01:24:26.561 --> 01:24:28.229
REWARD ASSESSMENT. SNEAKING A

01:24:28.296 --> 01:24:30.565
PILLAR TO HEAR IN THERE VERSUS

01:24:30.632 --> 01:24:32.200
TAKING THE WHOLE BOTTLE. LOCKING

01:24:32.267 --> 01:24:34.235
PILL VIALS ARE AN EFFECTIVE

01:24:34.302 --> 01:24:36.404
MEANS OF PREVENTING. OPIOID

01:24:36.471 --> 01:24:38.339
ADDICTION MAKING THAT SNAP

01:24:38.406 --> 01:24:41.242

A MUSICIAN HE WAS FUNNY AND HE-

01:24:54.222 --> 01:24:56.958
HE WAS LOCKED OUT. HE WAS ALSO

BROKEN BY AN UNFORGIVING SYSTEM

01:24:59.961 --> 01:25:01.129
AND THE DISEASE HE JUST COULDN'T

01:25:01.196 --> 01:25:03.331

QUESTIONS WITH RESPECT TO

PATIENTS BEING ABLE TO ACCESS

01:26:37.859 --> 01:26:39.227
THEIR MEDICATIONS SOME PATIENTS

01:26:39.294 --> 01:26:40.328
MIGHT HAVE DIFFICULTY OPENING A

01:26:40.395 --> 01:26:42.830
LOCKABLE VIAL FOR A NUMBER OF

01:26:42.897 --> 01:26:44.198
REASONS- OR THEY MIGHT FORGET

01:26:44.265 --> 01:26:45.600
THEIR PASSCODE AND BE UNABLE TO

01:26:45.667 --> 01:26:47.168
RETRIEVE IT WHEN THEY NEED IT

01:26:47.235 --> 01:26:49.103
LEAVING THEM WITHOUT ACCESS TO

01:26:49.170 --> 01:26:49.771
THE MEDICATION. SECOND THIS BILL

01:26:49.837 --> 01:26:51.172
WILL PUT SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC

01:26:51.239 --> 01:26:52.807
PRESSURE ON PHARMACIES- M.

01:26:52.874 --> 01:26:53.675
ALTHOUGH IT DOES REQUIRE

01:26:53.741 --> 01:26:55.076
MANUFACTURERS TO REIMBURSE

01:26:55.143 --> 01:26:56.411
PHARMACIES FOR THE COSTS OF THE

01:26:56.477 --> 01:26:57.512
LOCK WILL BILES PHARMACIES WILL

01:26:57.579 --> 01:26:59.414
STILL HAVE TO FRONT LOAD THE

01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:01.082
COSTS AND FOLLOW UP WITH

01:27:01.149 --> 01:27:01.716
MANUFACTURERS TO RAISE RECEIVE

01:27:01.783 --> 01:27:02.917
PAYMENT. PHARMACIES ACTUALLY

01:27:02.984 --> 01:27:04.118
INTERACT WITH MANUFACTURERS

01:27:04.185 --> 01:27:05.386
DIRECTLY TYPICALLY GO THROUGH

01:27:05.453 --> 01:27:07.121
WHOLESALERS SO TO IMPLEMENT THIS

01:27:07.188 --> 01:27:08.656
PROCESS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SET

01:27:08.723 --> 01:27:09.691
UP AN ENTIRE NEW ACCOUNTING

01:27:09.757 --> 01:27:11.225
SYSTEM JUST TO RECEIVE

01:27:11.292 --> 01:27:12.160
REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE LOCKABLE

01:27:12.226 --> 01:27:14.929
VIALS M. IMPLEMENTING THE SYSTEM

01:27:14.996 --> 01:27:16.064
AND CONSTANTLY FOLLOWING UP WITH

01:27:16.130 --> 01:27:17.098
MANUFACTURERS WILL PLACE A NEW

01:27:17.165 --> 01:27:18.866
FINANCIAL BURDEN ON PHARMACIES

01:27:18.933 --> 01:27:20.134
AND DISTRACT FROM PATIENT CARE

01:27:20.201 --> 01:27:21.302
AND I THINK AS WE HONOR

01:27:21.369 --> 01:27:23.037
PHARMACIES ARE INCREDIBLY BUSY

01:27:23.104 --> 01:27:24.706
PLACES- M. DISPENSING

01:27:24.772 --> 01:27:26.140
MEDICATIONS AM DOING HIS ASIANS

01:27:26.207 --> 01:27:28.910
AND TESTING THIS IS ONE MORE

01:27:28.977 --> 01:27:30.144
THING THAT WILL- PUT A KINK IN

01:27:30.211 --> 01:27:31.813
THE WORK FLOW. MY THIRD AND

01:27:31.879 --> 01:27:33.247
FINAL POINT PATIENTS ACTUALLY

01:27:33.314 --> 01:27:34.415
ALREADY HAVE ACCESS TO LOCKABLE

01:27:34.482 --> 01:27:36.351
VIALS I AM IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN

01:27:36.417 --> 01:27:38.786
THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED AB

01:27:38.853 --> 01:27:39.487
TWENTY EIGHT FIFTY NINE WHICH

01:27:39.554 --> 01:27:40.521
REQUIRES CHAIN PHARMACIES TO

PROMINENTLY DISPLAY AND OFFERED

01:27:42.023 --> 01:27:44.058
TO PATIENTS LOCKABLE STORAGE

01:27:44.125 --> 01:27:45.226
PRODUCTS INCLUDING LOCKABLE

01:27:45.293 --> 01:27:46.361
PRESCRIPTION VIALS M. THE

01:27:46.427 --> 01:27:47.895
PATIENTS IF THEY WANT TO USE

01:27:47.962 --> 01:27:49.230
THEM THEY THEY ARE ABLE TO DO

01:27:49.297 --> 01:27:51.199
IT. THE SLIDE HAS ONLY BEEN IN

01:27:51.265 --> 01:27:52.767
EFFECT FOR A BELIEVE THREE YEARS

01:27:52.834 --> 01:27:54.569
SO WE THINK IT IS PREMATURE TO

01:27:54.636 --> 01:27:56.170
IMPLEMENT A MANDATE WITHOUT

01:27:56.237 --> 01:27:57.639
FIRST SEEING IF THE SLOT IS

01:27:57.705 --> 01:28:03.911
WORKING AND. SEEING IF IT HAS

01:28:03.978 --> 01:28:05.046
BEEN EFFECTIVE IN ACTUALLY CAN

01:28:05.113 --> 01:28:05.980
ADDING PRESCRIPTION DRUG- TELL

01:28:06.047 --> 01:28:06.514
FRANK. FOR AN ABUSE. M.

01:28:06.581 --> 01:28:07.048
DEFINITELY APPRECIATE THE

01:28:07.115 --> 01:28:08.149
AMENDMENTS RECOMMENDED THE

01:28:08.216 --> 01:28:09.884
COMMITTEE AND- WHICH- THEIR-

01:28:09.951 --> 01:28:11.185
THAT PHARMACIES MAINTAIN PATIENT

01:28:11.252 --> 01:28:11.753
PASSCODES. BUT UNFORTUNATELY

01:28:11.819 --> 01:28:13.554

DOLLARS IN DIFFERENT AREAS IS

THE TOTAL FOR FIFTY FOUR DOLLARS

01:31:14.569 --> 01:31:15.369
AND FIFTY CENTS. IS IT TWO

01:31:15.436 --> 01:31:17.738
DOLLARS FOR THE VIAL AND THEN

01:31:17.805 --> 01:31:19.674
TWO DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS BACK

01:31:19.740 --> 01:31:22.777
TO THE PHARMACIST. NO IT'S

01:31:22.844 --> 01:31:25.279
CHARACTER A TWO TO. PER LOCKABLE

01:31:25.346 --> 01:31:28.616
FILE- THE ANTICIPATION AND HAPPY

01:31:28.683 --> 01:31:32.220
TO ADDRESS THE- OPPOSITION. BUT

01:31:32.286 --> 01:31:33.588
AS WE KNOW PHARMACIES ARE BUSY

01:31:33.654 --> 01:31:35.189
PLACES BUT WE'VE HEARD

01:31:35.256 --> 01:31:37.158
ANECDOTALLY IT TAKES ABOUT FIVE

01:31:37.225 --> 01:31:39.594
SECONDS. FOR THE PHARMACIST TO

01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:41.229
BE ABLE TO PROGRAM IN. THE

01:31:41.295 --> 01:31:44.098
LOCKABLE PILL VIAL AND SO. WHILE

01:31:44.165 --> 01:31:45.766
WE'RE ON THERE ARE OTHERS WHO

01:31:45.833 --> 01:31:47.368
WOULD LIKE TO ATTRIBUTE THAT

01:31:47.435 --> 01:31:49.237
COST I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

01:31:49.303 --> 01:31:51.672
US TO FOCUS ON. THE MECHANISM

01:31:51.739 --> 01:31:54.141
THE LOCKABLE PILL VIAL ITSELF.

01:31:54.208 --> 01:31:59.780
OKAY SO WHEN IT SAYS- I WENT RAN

01:31:59.847 --> 01:32:00.448
. RECEIVING THE PHARMACY

01:32:00.514 --> 01:32:01.949
CLAMORING FOR THE COST OF THE

01:32:02.016 --> 01:32:03.718
LOCKABLE FILE NOT TO EXCEED TWO

01:32:03.784 --> 01:32:04.619
DOLLARS PROFILE AND FOR THE

01:32:04.685 --> 01:32:06.120
PHARMACY DISPENSING COSTS AND

01:32:06.187 --> 01:32:08.189
SERVICES RENDERED NOT TO EXCEED

01:32:08.256 --> 01:32:09.657
TO FIFTY. I DON'T THINK IT

01:32:09.724 --> 01:32:11.559
CHANGES THE DISPENSING SERVICES

01:32:11.626 --> 01:32:14.295
I BELIEVE THE PHARMACIST HAS THE

01:32:14.362 --> 01:32:15.997
SAME RESPONSIBILITIES IT'S FIVE

01:32:16.063 --> 01:32:17.531
SECONDS ADDED TO THEM PROGRAM

01:32:17.598 --> 01:32:19.667
AND LOCKABLE PULLED BY I DON'T

01:32:19.734 --> 01:32:21.302
THINK IT'S- ANY DIFFERENT FROM

01:32:21.369 --> 01:32:22.837
THEM- ADMINISTERING

01:32:22.904 --> 01:32:24.939
PRESCRIPTIONS TODAY. OKAY SAID

01:32:25.006 --> 01:32:26.974
THAT WOULD NOT AT TWO FIFTY IS

01:32:27.041 --> 01:32:28.209
THAT I THINK THAT'S WHAT IT'S

01:32:28.276 --> 01:32:30.411
CURRENTLY IT'S KNOTS TO EXCEED

01:32:30.478 --> 01:32:35.650
THAT OKAY- IS THERE ANY. THE WAY

01:32:35.716 --> 01:32:38.586
THAT YOU CAN SEE- AT SOME. THE

01:32:38.653 --> 01:32:40.521
INCREASE COSTS BEING PASSED TO

01:32:40.588 --> 01:32:42.223
THE PATIENT. I THINK IT'S

01:32:42.290 --> 01:32:44.292
IMPORTANT FOR US TO FOCUS ON THE

01:32:44.358 --> 01:32:45.793
FACT THAT MANUFACTURERS HAVE

01:32:45.860 --> 01:32:47.094
BEEN PROFITING OFF OF THIS

01:32:47.161 --> 01:32:50.264
OPIOID CRISIS FOR QUITE A WHILE

01:32:50.331 --> 01:32:51.599
HERE. AND FOR US TO MAKE SURE

01:32:51.666 --> 01:32:53.801
THAT WERE DIRECTING THE COST TO

01:32:53.868 --> 01:32:55.937
THE MANUFACTURERS IS THE INTENT

01:32:56.003 --> 01:32:58.839
OF THE BILL- HI I BELIEVE WHEN

01:32:58.906 --> 01:33:00.841
WE LOOK AT THE PROFIT MARGINS OF

01:33:00.908 --> 01:33:02.743
MANY OF THESE LARGE COMPANIES AS

01:33:02.810 --> 01:33:05.513
WELL WITHIN THEIR- PROFITS TO BE

01:33:05.579 --> 01:33:07.949
ABLE TO ABSORB SOME OF THE COST

01:33:08.015 --> 01:33:09.717
OF ADMINISTERING THIS THE NEW

01:33:09.784 --> 01:33:12.019
AND IMPROVED WAY. I THINK SINCE

01:33:12.086 --> 01:33:13.287
IT'S BEEN FIFTY YEARS SINCE

01:33:13.354 --> 01:33:14.922
WE'VE DONE CHILD RESISTANT FOX I

01:33:14.989 --> 01:33:16.958
THINK IT'S LONG PAST TIME. FOR

01:33:17.024 --> 01:33:18.125
US TO LOOK AT THE MEDIUM IN

01:33:18.192 --> 01:33:20.161
INSURANCE THE MOST PROTECTIVE

01:33:20.227 --> 01:33:21.796
THAT WE CAN TO HELP TO ENSURE

01:33:21.862 --> 01:33:24.231
THAT WHAT OCCURRED HERE IS NOT

01:33:24.298 --> 01:33:26.400
GOING TO OCCUR AGAIN. NO I AGREE

01:33:26.467 --> 01:33:28.269
I WOULD JUST SAY THAT AS IT

01:33:28.336 --> 01:33:29.403
MOVES FOR YOU'RE PROBABLY

01:33:29.470 --> 01:33:31.439
LOOKING TO SEE IF THERE'S A WAY

01:33:31.505 --> 01:33:32.640
IN WHICH WE CAN ENSURE THAT THE

01:33:32.707 --> 01:33:34.508
MANUFACTURERS WILL NOT BE ABLE

01:33:34.575 --> 01:33:35.676
TO PASS THESE COSTS DOWN TO

01:33:35.743 --> 01:33:36.911
PATIENTS BECAUSE PRESCRIPTION

01:33:36.978 --> 01:33:38.779
DRUGS. ARE ALREADY EXTREMELY

01:33:38.846 --> 01:33:40.781
HIGH FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE AND WE

01:33:40.848 --> 01:33:42.083
WOULDN'T WANT THOSE THAT NEED IT

01:33:42.149 --> 01:33:45.019
TO HAVE THIS AS A BARRIER- I

01:33:45.086 --> 01:33:47.421
WOULD ALSO JUST- YOU KNOW

01:33:47.488 --> 01:33:49.590
ENCOURAGE YOU TO. CONTINUE TO

01:33:49.657 --> 01:33:50.524
WORK WITH SOME OF THE

01:33:50.591 --> 01:33:53.027
OPPOSITION- ONE OF THE THINGS

01:33:53.094 --> 01:33:55.096
THAT I DID HAVE DOWN IS THE UP.

01:33:55.162 --> 01:33:57.298
FRONT COST BURDEN TO MANY OF THE

01:33:57.365 --> 01:34:00.101
PHARMACIES- IT MAY NOT BE THAT

01:34:00.167 --> 01:34:02.236
BIG OF A DEAL FOR SOME OF THE

01:34:02.303 --> 01:34:03.104
LARGER CHAINS LIKE CVS TO

01:34:03.170 --> 01:34:05.473

WANT THIS TO BE TOO MUCH OF A

01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:14.248
FINANCIAL BURDEN ON THEM WHERE

01:34:14.315 --> 01:34:15.349
THEY'RE UP FRONTING THE MONEY

01:34:15.416 --> 01:34:16.751
AND THEN HAVING TO WAIT. THIS

LAW- BILES THE PHARMACIES HAVE

01:34:29.730 --> 01:34:31.432

ACTUALLY MAY BE ABLE TO ASSESS

01:34:38.672 --> 01:34:42.777
SOME OF OUR PHARMACY SINCE WE'RE

01:34:42.843 --> 01:34:44.011

OF OUR CHILDREN TO BE ABLE TO

01:35:04.331 --> 01:35:05.699
