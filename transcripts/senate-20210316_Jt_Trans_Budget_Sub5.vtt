00:13:00.713 --> 00:13:01.714
ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS SO WE

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:03.716
WOULD MOVE OUR CENTRAL VALLEY

00:13:03.782 --> 00:13:04.783
BUDGET FROM TWELVE POINT FOUR

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:06.819
THIRTEEN. POINT EIGHT AGAIN A

00:13:06.886 --> 00:13:09.088
BILLION DOLLARS OF THAT IS WHAT

00:13:09.155 --> 00:13:10.923
WE CALL RISK CONTINGENCY AND

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:16.328
THE DONATION HERE IS THE. SEE

00:13:16.395 --> 00:13:18.197
THAT WE MUST GET DONE TO FINISH

00:13:18.264 --> 00:13:20.332
THE WORK IN THE RISK ELEMENT IS

00:13:20.399 --> 00:13:22.101
RECOGNIZING THAT THOSE ARE

00:13:22.168 --> 00:13:24.203
STILL SUBJECT TO COMMERCIAL

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:25.504
NEGOTIATION THE FUTURE THERE'S

00:13:25.571 --> 00:13:27.573
SOME. RISK IN THOSE NUMBERS SO

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.508
WE WANT TO HAVE A CONTINGENCY.

00:13:29.575 --> 00:13:30.543
TO DEAL WITH THAT AS WELL AS

00:13:30.609 --> 00:13:32.044
SOMETHING WE LEARNED FROM

00:13:32.111 --> 00:13:33.512
COPING NINETEEN WHICH IS THAT.

00:13:33.579 --> 00:13:35.014
THE RISK IS ALL AROUND US YEAH

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.815
IT DOES SOMETIMES YOU CAN

00:13:36.882 --> 00:13:38.918
ANTICIPATE THE IMPACTS PROGRESS

00:13:38.984 --> 00:13:40.819
THERE ARE KNOWN AND SERVE AS A

00:13:40.886 --> 00:13:42.087
SORT OF PRUDENT PRACTICE WE

00:13:42.154 --> 00:13:43.355
WANT TO EXPAND. THAT RISK

00:13:43.422 --> 00:13:47.493
CONTINGENCY POT. NEXT SLIDE.

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:50.095
THIS AGAIN IS OUR- OUR SCHEDULE

00:13:50.162 --> 00:13:51.163
FOR ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENT

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:52.665
COMPLETION. YOU SEE IN THE

00:13:52.731 --> 00:13:54.967
MIDDLE COLUMN THERE THAT. IN

00:13:55.034 --> 00:13:56.569
TWENTY TWENTY- WE PUT OUT FOR

00:13:56.635 --> 00:13:58.571

NORTHERN CALIFORNIA GETTING

00:14:01.674 --> 00:14:03.475
INTO THE BAY AREA. WE WILL

00:14:03.542 --> 00:14:04.777
COMPLETE THAT WORK OR BRING

00:14:04.843 --> 00:14:06.845
THOSE TO OUR BOARD. FOR WHAT WE

00:14:06.912 --> 00:14:09.181
CALL RECORD OF DECISION OR ROD

00:14:09.248 --> 00:14:12.151
CERTIFICATION. AT THE- AB

00:14:12.218 --> 00:14:15.087
SECOND AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF

TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN THE FIRST

00:14:15.754 --> 00:14:17.256
PART OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AT

00:14:17.323 --> 00:14:19.358
THE FINAL TO. PASS WILL BE

00:14:19.425 --> 00:14:21.794
RELEASED LATER THIS YEAR AND-

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:23.495
WE HOPE TO FINISH THAT WORK AND

00:14:23.562 --> 00:14:26.298
CERTIFY THOSE RIGHTS THE END OF

00:14:26.365 --> 00:14:27.700
TWENTY TWO BEGINNING OF A

00:14:27.766 --> 00:14:31.737
TWENTY TWENTY THREE. NEXT SLIDE.

00:14:31.804 --> 00:14:33.505
IN FEBRUARY WHEN WE PUT OUT OUR

00:14:33.572 --> 00:14:35.774
DRAFT PLAN AND EVEN OUR LAST

00:14:35.841 --> 00:14:37.176
PROJECT UPDATE REPORT TO THE

00:14:37.243 --> 00:14:39.545
LEGISLATURE. FROM TWENTY

00:14:39.612 --> 00:14:40.346
NINETEEN WE INDICATED AN

00:14:40.412 --> 00:14:43.182
INTEREST. TO MOVE THE HUNDRED

00:14:43.249 --> 00:14:44.717
NINETY MILES THAT ARE CURRENTLY

00:14:44.783 --> 00:14:45.251
IN THE IN CONSTRUCTION THE

00:14:45.317 --> 00:14:48.087
BALLOT. TO EXTEND THOSE TWO

00:14:48.153 --> 00:14:48.687
HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE MILE IN A

00:14:48.754 --> 00:14:50.556
ROOM SERVICE AND THAT IS SO WE

00:14:50.623 --> 00:14:51.824
CAN GET ELECTRIFIED HIGH SPEED

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:54.059
SERVICE GOING. IN THE CENTRAL

00:14:54.126 --> 00:14:55.194
VALLEY CONNECTING THE CITIES OF

00:14:55.261 --> 00:14:58.264
MERCED. FRESNO AND BAKERSFIELD.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:00.299
WE DID AN EXTENSIVE ANALYSIS OF

00:15:00.366 --> 00:15:02.568
THIS WITH A- OPERATING ENTITY

00:15:02.635 --> 00:15:03.869
THAT OPERATES HIGH SPEED RAIL

00:15:03.936 --> 00:15:06.438
IN GERMANY TODAY. AND WE CAME

00:15:06.505 --> 00:15:08.240
UP WITH THE PROPOSAL TO MOVE

00:15:08.307 --> 00:15:10.175
FORWARD ON THIS EARLY OPERATING

00:15:10.242 --> 00:15:11.677
SYSTEM THAT WOULD. REDUCE

00:15:11.744 --> 00:15:12.911
TRAVEL TIME COMPARED TO THE

00:15:12.978 --> 00:15:14.346
CURRENT. SERVICES IN THE

00:15:14.413 --> 00:15:16.582
CENTRAL VALLEY. BETWEEN NINETY

00:15:16.649 --> 00:15:18.350
AND A HUNDRED MINUTES. A WE

00:15:18.417 --> 00:15:20.185
WOULD INCREASE THE FREQUENCY OF

00:15:20.252 --> 00:15:21.587
SERVICE FROM SEVEN DAILY TRIPS

00:15:21.654 --> 00:15:23.822
TODAY. THE UP TO EIGHTEEN DAILY

00:15:23.889 --> 00:15:27.926
TRIPS. WE WOULD CONNECT THREE

00:15:27.993 --> 00:15:28.527
THE FASTEST GROWING CITIES IN

00:15:28.594 --> 00:15:29.461
THE STATE. DO THE GREATEST

00:15:29.528 --> 00:15:31.930
RIDERSHIP INCREASE AND FAREBOX

00:15:31.997 --> 00:15:33.399
BENEFIT. FROM THE SMALLEST

00:15:33.465 --> 00:15:35.768
INVESTMENT. COMPARED TO

00:15:35.834 --> 00:15:37.536
INVESTING THOSE SAME DOLLARS IN

00:15:37.603 --> 00:15:39.438
OTHER CORRIDORS. AND IT

00:15:39.505 --> 00:15:40.839
PROVIDES FOR INTERIM CONNECTION

00:15:40.906 --> 00:15:42.841
TO PARTSNORTH OF THE IN THE

00:15:42.908 --> 00:15:44.343
SAN JOAQUIN SERVICE WHICH MEANS

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:46.578
WE WOULD CONNECT WITH THE SAN

00:15:46.645 --> 00:15:48.580
JOAQUIN SYSTEM IN MERCED- THAT

00:15:48.647 --> 00:15:49.915
SYSTEM WOULD CONTINUE ON UP TO

00:15:49.982 --> 00:15:52.284
SACRAMENTO AND OAKLAND. AND THE

00:15:52.351 --> 00:15:53.552
AC SYSTEM WHICH IS NOW BEING

00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:55.521
EXTENDED TO MERCED WOULD ALSO

00:15:55.587 --> 00:15:57.556
ULTIMATELY GO THAT NOW GOES TO

00:15:57.623 --> 00:15:59.158
THE BERRY WOULD ALSO HAVE TRIPS

00:15:59.224 --> 00:16:00.893
TO SACRAMENTO IN THE FUTURE

00:16:00.959 --> 00:16:02.261
YEAH DUBBED THAT CAN ACTUALLY

00:16:02.328 --> 00:16:03.595
BE NAY AT PERCENT. THE

00:16:03.662 --> 00:16:05.264
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE HUNDRED

00:16:05.331 --> 00:16:06.532
SEVENTY ONE MILE SEGMENT IS

00:16:06.598 --> 00:16:08.467
EXPECTED TO GENERATE SOME

00:16:08.534 --> 00:16:09.034
CHILDREN THREE THOUSAND JOB

00:16:09.101 --> 00:16:11.136
YEARS. NEARLY FORTY BILLION IN

00:16:11.203 --> 00:16:15.140
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. NEXT SLIDE.

00:16:15.207 --> 00:16:16.975
THE OTHER IMPORTANT PART OF

00:16:17.042 --> 00:16:19.545
THIS EXTENSION IS WHAT WE CALL

00:16:19.611 --> 00:16:21.046
GETTING OUT OF THE ORCHARDS AND

00:16:21.113 --> 00:16:22.881
INTO THE CITIES. AND THAT IS AT

00:16:22.948 --> 00:16:24.450
POPLAR AVENUE PICTURE THERE ON

00:16:24.516 --> 00:16:26.685
THE TOP LEFT. IS A PHOTO OF THE

00:16:26.752 --> 00:16:28.620
CURRENT TERMINATION POINT. FOR

00:16:28.687 --> 00:16:29.988
THE HUNDRED NINETEEN FIRST

00:16:30.055 --> 00:16:31.657
CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT HUNDRED

00:16:31.724 --> 00:16:32.191
NINETY MILE. CONSTRUCTION

00:16:32.257 --> 00:16:34.159
SEGMENT. PART OF EXTENDING

00:16:34.226 --> 00:16:36.261
FURTHER INTO THE- BAKERSFIELD

00:16:36.328 --> 00:16:37.696
DOWNTOWN AREA IS REALLY THE

00:16:37.763 --> 00:16:39.765
IDEA OF. THOSE EIGHTEEN MILES

00:16:39.832 --> 00:16:40.899
GET THE TRAIN INTO A POPULATED

00:16:40.966 --> 00:16:42.501
AREA. IN A STATION WHERE

00:16:42.568 --> 00:16:44.670
CONNECTION POINTS TO LOCAL. A

00:16:44.737 --> 00:16:45.738
TRANSIT OPTIONS ARE EASILY

00:16:45.804 --> 00:16:47.373
AVAILABLE AND BUSES TRAVELING

00:16:47.439 --> 00:16:48.774
FURTHER SOUTH. TO SOUTHERN

00:16:48.841 --> 00:16:50.008
CALIFORNIA SO THE IDEA IS TO

00:16:50.075 --> 00:16:52.344
MOVE. INTO THE URBAN DOWNTOWN

00:16:52.411 --> 00:16:55.848
AREA YEAH AND OUT OF THE

00:16:55.914 --> 00:16:57.683
ORCHARDS THANKS FOR. SIMILARLY

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.284
IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WHAT GO

00:16:59.351 --> 00:17:01.053
BACK ONE PLEASE. THIS IS

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.821
SIMILARLY IN NORTHERN THE

00:17:02.888 --> 00:17:05.424
NORTHERN TERMINUS POINT THAT

00:17:05.491 --> 00:17:06.258
ROAD TWENTY SIX IDENTIFICATION

00:17:06.325 --> 00:17:08.260
IS THE- CURRENT TERMINUS IN

00:17:08.327 --> 00:17:11.263
MADERA- IT IS IN A SUBDIVISION

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:13.532
AND CLOSE TO. UP A GOLF COURSE

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:15.968
AND AGAIN BY EXTENDING THIRTY

00:17:16.034 --> 00:17:17.102
FIVE MILES NORTH INTO DOWNTOWN

00:17:17.169 --> 00:17:20.506
MERCED OUR INTENTION IS TO. GO

00:17:20.572 --> 00:17:21.140
TO THE STATION IN MERCED

00:17:21.206 --> 00:17:23.308
MEETING THE SAN MARKINGS IN A

00:17:23.375 --> 00:17:25.310
SYSTEMS THERE THEY GO FURTHER

00:17:25.377 --> 00:17:27.079
NORTH TO THE BAY AREA IN.

00:17:27.146 --> 00:17:29.281
SACRAMENTO AND SO AGAIN THESE

00:17:29.348 --> 00:17:30.883
ARE SOME OF THE ELEMENTS OF.

00:17:30.949 --> 00:17:33.585
MOVING FROM ONE NINETEEN TO ONE

00:17:33.652 --> 00:17:34.186
SEVENTY ONE GET YOU INTO THE

00:17:34.253 --> 00:17:37.890
DOWNTOWN URBAN AREAS. WHICH WE

00:17:37.956 --> 00:17:38.957
THINK MAKES THE MOST SENSE FOR.

00:17:39.024 --> 00:17:42.161
APPLE NEXT TO SLIDE. WE DID

00:17:42.227 --> 00:17:43.061
EVALUATE SOME QUESTIONS THAT

00:17:43.128 --> 00:17:44.363
WERE RAISED BY THE LEGISLATURE

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:46.565
IN THE PEER REVIEW GROUP- BASED

00:17:46.632 --> 00:17:49.234
ON OUR PROPOSAL TO DO THE

00:17:49.301 --> 00:17:49.735
HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE MILE

00:17:49.802 --> 00:17:51.937
STRETCH WE WERE ASKED TO HAVE A

00:17:52.004 --> 00:17:53.105
INDEPENDENT PEER REVIEW OF OUR

00:17:53.172 --> 00:17:55.240
RIDERSHIP FORECASTS FOR THAT

00:17:55.307 --> 00:17:57.342
CENTRAL VALLEY. HUNDRED SEVENTY

00:17:57.409 --> 00:17:59.077
ONE MILE STRETCH. AND WE ALSO

00:17:59.144 --> 00:18:00.245
ENTERED A MEMORANDUM OF

00:18:00.312 --> 00:18:02.281
UNDERSTANDING WITH THE

AGENCY. M. S. N. WORKING JOINT

00:18:05.284 --> 00:18:07.986
POWERS AUTHORITY. FOR TO DEFINE

00:18:08.053 --> 00:18:09.521
THE INTER SERVICE ROLES OF EACH

00:18:09.588 --> 00:18:11.623
AGENCY AND RESPONSIBILITIES AND

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:13.325
SO WE HAVE A HIGH LEVEL AND-

00:18:13.392 --> 00:18:16.495
YOU THAT LAYS THOSE OUT. IN

00:18:16.562 --> 00:18:18.330
THAT INTERVIEW ITSELF CALLS FOR

00:18:18.397 --> 00:18:20.232
FUTURE MORE SPECIFIC IMHO USES

00:18:20.299 --> 00:18:22.401
WE GET CLOSER TO OPERATING UP

00:18:22.468 --> 00:18:24.203
WORKING THROUGH OUR OUR SISTER

00:18:24.269 --> 00:18:26.104
AGENCIES HERE THAT WOULD BE

00:18:26.171 --> 00:18:28.273
PART OF THE OPERATING SERVICE-

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.108
THANKS LIGHT. THE END

00:18:30.175 --> 00:18:32.611
INDEPENDENT PEER REVIEW- ENTITY

00:18:32.678 --> 00:18:34.213
THAT LOOKED AT OUR COST

00:18:34.279 --> 00:18:35.914
ESTIMATES THAT ARE A IDERSHIP

00:18:35.981 --> 00:18:39.251
ESTIMATES. OF FOR THE CENTRAL

00:18:39.318 --> 00:18:41.553
VALLEY SEGMENT- AGAIN WE WERE

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:43.088
ASKED BY THE LEGISLATURE WE

00:18:43.155 --> 00:18:44.556
CONTRACTED WITH RESOURCE

00:18:46.825 --> 00:18:47.826
WITH THE PEER REVIEW GROUP TO

00:18:47.893 --> 00:18:49.728
IDENTIFY THEM AND IDENTIFY DOES

00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:52.464
GO. OF THEIR REVIEW- THAT THIRD

ASSUMPTIONS AND RESULTS

00:18:57.836 --> 00:18:59.905
REASONABLE. THEIR CONCLUSIONS

00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:01.240
WERE THEY FOUND NO FATAL FLAWS

00:19:01.306 --> 00:19:03.342
WITH THE- APPLICATION OF THE

00:19:03.408 --> 00:19:05.210
MODEL AND THE RIDERSHIP NUMBERS

00:19:05.277 --> 00:19:08.413
THAT WE- WE- PUT FORTH LAST

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.716
YEAR. RIDERSHIP ESTIMATES ARE

00:19:10.782 --> 00:19:11.917
WITHIN THE RANGE IS FOR TRAVEL

00:19:11.984 --> 00:19:13.685
TIME. AND FREQUENCY AND

00:19:13.752 --> 00:19:15.654
IMPORTANTLY THEY CAN CURRENT

00:19:15.721 --> 00:19:18.457
THAT- OUR APPROACH TO MOVE TO

00:19:18.524 --> 00:19:19.424
THE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE MILES

00:19:19.491 --> 00:19:21.260
IN THE VALLEY. OBTAINS THE

00:19:21.326 --> 00:19:22.094
HIGHEST FORECAST GAIN IN

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.263
RIDERSHIP AND DOES SO AT THE

00:19:24.329 --> 00:19:27.266
LOWEST INCREASE IN COST. A NEXT

00:19:27.332 --> 00:19:30.402
LIFE. SOME OF THESE STUDIES AN

00:19:30.469 --> 00:19:32.271
AVERAGE REAFFIRMED VALUE FOR US

00:19:32.337 --> 00:19:33.438
OF THE MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD

00:19:33.505 --> 00:19:35.541
INTERIM SERVICE- THESE

00:19:35.607 --> 00:19:37.409
EXTENSIONS ARE ENVIRONMENTALLY

00:19:37.476 --> 00:19:39.878
CLEARED TODAY- AND WE RECOMMEND

00:19:39.945 --> 00:19:42.014
IT BE DANCING THE DESIGN WHICH

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.316
WILL INCLUDE. ENGINEERING TO

00:19:44.383 --> 00:19:46.552
ALLOW US TO GET THE- WORK WITH

LARGE TO THIS I MEAN. WE WENT

00:28:53.798 --> 00:28:54.365
FROM A PROMISING. TWENTY TWENTY

00:28:54.432 --> 00:28:55.400
HIGH SPEED RAIL AND LOOK IT

00:28:55.467 --> 00:28:56.634

CARE ABOUT THAT LET'S GET IT

00:28:57.902 --> 00:29:00.738
RIGHT WERE AT. NOW 80% OF THE

00:29:00.805 --> 00:29:04.542
COST IS ON CALIFORNIANS. MAYBE

00:29:04.609 --> 00:29:06.077
IT'S TIME THAT WE YOU KNOW PLOW

00:29:06.144 --> 00:29:07.445
THAT DOWN IN PLANT SOMETHING

00:29:07.512 --> 00:29:10.315
DIFFERENT AND TAKE A MASSIVE

00:29:10.381 --> 00:29:12.517
AMOUNT OF RESOURCES. THAT IS

00:29:12.584 --> 00:29:14.819
BEING USED OUT OF OUR CAP AND

00:29:14.886 --> 00:29:16.354
TRADE FUNDS AND PUT THEM TO

00:29:16.421 --> 00:29:18.123
GOOD USE IS WHERE WE KNOW WE

00:29:18.189 --> 00:29:20.258
CAN DO A BETTER JOB. BUT I KNOW

00:29:20.325 --> 00:29:22.494
THE VOTERS TO PUT THIS ON THE

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:23.795
BALLOT BUT THEY THIS IS NOT

00:29:23.862 --> 00:29:25.296
WHAT THEY EXPECTED I THINK THEY

00:29:25.363 --> 00:29:27.031
WERE SOLD SOMETHING THAT.

00:29:27.098 --> 00:29:27.932
DEFINITELY HAS NOT COME

00:29:27.999 --> 00:29:29.968
THROUGH. AND I THINK IT'S TIME

00:29:30.034 --> 00:29:31.236
TO THE LEGISLATURE MAYBE GOES

00:29:31.302 --> 00:29:32.637
BACK TO THE VOTERS TO FIND OUT

00:29:32.704 --> 00:29:33.705
IF IT'S REALLY SOMETHING THEY

00:29:33.771 --> 00:29:35.373
WANT TO. CONTINUE WITH BECAUSE

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.275
AT THE END OF THE DAY. I DON'T

00:29:37.342 --> 00:29:39.043
BELIEVE. WILL EVER SEE THIS

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:40.278
COMPLETED IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE

00:29:40.345 --> 00:29:41.946
A DOUBLE TRACK. AND NOW WE'RE

00:29:42.013 --> 00:29:44.082
TALKING ABOUT A SINGLE TRACK.

00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:46.284
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TIMES. FOR

00:29:46.351 --> 00:29:48.052
TRAINS TO MOVEPEOPLE THAT ARE

00:29:48.119 --> 00:29:49.621
GOING TO MOVE HIM IN THE FACE

00:29:49.687 --> 00:29:50.788
IN THE FASHION THAT. WAS

00:29:50.855 --> 00:29:54.159
PROMISED AND SO I THINK IT'S

00:29:54.225 --> 00:29:55.527
TIME THAT YOU KNOW FOR ME I'M

00:29:55.593 --> 00:29:57.061
READY TO WALK AWAY FROM IT BEEN

00:29:57.128 --> 00:29:58.696
READY TO WALK AWAY FOR AWHILE

00:29:58.763 --> 00:30:00.198
AND I SERVE ON THE SENATE

00:30:00.265 --> 00:30:01.833
TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION AND

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:03.468
YOU KNOW WE CAN BLAME CODE FOR

00:30:03.535 --> 00:30:06.137
EVERYTHING BUT AT THE END OF

00:30:06.204 --> 00:30:06.704
THE DAY THIS ISN'T A COVERT

00:30:06.771 --> 00:30:08.806
PROBLEM. THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH

00:30:08.873 --> 00:30:09.541
BEING ABLE TO DELIVER

00:30:09.607 --> 00:30:12.043
SOMETHING. IN A TIMELY MANNER

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:12.644
AND THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:13.978
PARTNERS THAT ARE WERE BEING.

00:30:14.045 --> 00:30:15.079
WE'RE GOING TO BE AVAILABLE

00:30:15.146 --> 00:30:16.981
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE PRIVATE.

00:30:17.048 --> 00:30:18.449
INVESTMENT WE HAVE NOT SEEN AND

00:30:18.516 --> 00:30:19.984
WE WON'T SEE SO I THINK IT'S

00:30:20.051 --> 00:30:21.920
TIME THAT WE JUST DO A REALITY

00:30:21.986 --> 00:30:22.987
CHECK HERE MAYBE PLOW THIS BILL

00:30:23.054 --> 00:30:24.756
DOWN. AND GO TO SOMETHING

00:30:24.822 --> 00:30:26.724
DIFFERENT BECAUSE- AT THE END

00:30:26.791 --> 00:30:28.293
OF THE DAY. WE'RE ALL GOING TO

00:30:28.359 --> 00:30:30.328
BE SITTING HERE FOR I GOT THREE

00:30:30.395 --> 00:30:32.730
MORE YEARS OF THIS TWENTY

00:30:32.797 --> 00:30:33.331
TWENTY FOUR I'M OUT HERE AND I

00:30:33.398 --> 00:30:35.133
WILL GUARANTEE YOU. I WOULD BET

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.234
MY WHOLE FORM ON IT THAT WE

WON'T BE WHERE WE'RE SAYING

00:30:37.302 --> 00:30:39.037
WE'RE GOING TO BE TODAY. IN

00:30:39.103 --> 00:30:41.172
FOUR MORE YEARS. OR IN TEN

00:30:41.239 --> 00:30:42.974
YEARS. AND THE COST WILL

00:30:43.041 --> 00:30:44.509
CONTINUE TO RISE IN THERE

00:30:44.576 --> 00:30:46.110
ALWAYS BE A REASON THAT IT

00:30:46.177 --> 00:30:48.479
DOESN'T WORK OUT. I THINK THE

00:30:48.546 --> 00:30:50.315
VOTERS A CALIFORNIA. REALLY

00:30:50.381 --> 00:30:51.950
DON'T LIKE THIS PROJECT AND I

00:30:52.016 --> 00:30:53.885
THINK THEY'RE REALLY WAKING UP

00:30:53.952 --> 00:30:56.087
TO THE FACT. THAT WE CONTINUE.

00:30:56.154 --> 00:30:58.022
TO JUST LISTEN TO THIS.

00:30:58.089 --> 00:30:59.624
NARRATIVE THAT IT'S GOING TO.

00:30:59.691 --> 00:31:01.259
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN SOONER.

00:31:01.326 --> 00:31:03.094
AND IT ISN'T. LET'S BE REAL

00:31:03.161 --> 00:31:05.096
HERE. SO I JUST WANT TO GET IT

00:31:05.163 --> 00:31:07.699
ON THE RECORD THAT HATE. THIS

00:31:07.765 --> 00:31:09.400

IS NOT GOING TO DO WHAT. THEY

00:31:11.469 --> 00:31:13.404
SAY IT'S GOING TO DO. SO FOR

00:31:13.471 --> 00:31:14.539
THOSE REASONS I THINK WE SHOULD

00:31:14.606 --> 00:31:16.040

00:33:36.547 --> 00:33:38.716
WANT TO BE CLEAR ULTIMATELY THE

00:33:38.783 --> 00:33:39.784
HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM WILL BE

00:33:39.851 --> 00:33:41.652
A TWO TRACK. SYSTEM BUT THE

00:33:41.719 --> 00:33:43.221
QUESTION IS AND THE APPROACH

00:33:43.287 --> 00:33:45.356
HERE IS TO WORK TOWARD AN

00:33:45.423 --> 00:33:47.158
OPERATING SEGMENT IN A WAY THAT

00:33:47.225 --> 00:33:48.393
WORKS WITHIN OUR BUDGET AND

00:33:48.459 --> 00:33:50.528
BELOW TODAY. WE HAVE A KNOWN

00:33:50.595 --> 00:33:52.430
ESTIMATE OF REVENUE BETWEEN

00:33:52.497 --> 00:33:53.297
TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY THREE

00:33:53.364 --> 00:33:55.533
BILLION. DOLLARS AND OUR

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:58.703
INTENTION IS TO- PUT IN PLACE

00:33:58.770 --> 00:33:59.637
AN OPERATING SEGMENT BETWEEN

00:33:59.704 --> 00:34:02.306
CITIES THAT. CAN BE DONE FOR

00:34:02.373 --> 00:34:04.542
THAT UP THAT MAY MEAN THAT WE

00:34:04.609 --> 00:34:05.943
FACED THE TRACK WE'RE GOING TO

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:08.212
HELP OUR BIDDERS. INCLUDING IN

00:34:08.279 --> 00:34:10.114
THEIR BIDS WHAT EACH ELEMENT

00:34:10.181 --> 00:34:11.983
WOULD LOOK LIKE ONE TRACK NOW

00:34:12.049 --> 00:34:14.118
THE SECOND TRACK LATER VERSES

00:34:14.185 --> 00:34:15.987
TO TRACKS NOW SO WE CAN MAKE AN

00:34:16.053 --> 00:34:18.489
EDUCATED DECISION- BUT WE ARE

00:34:18.556 --> 00:34:22.226
NOT. I'M NOT ADVOCATING FOR ANY

00:34:22.293 --> 00:34:22.994
ADDITIONAL. THEY FUNDING ONE OF

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:24.262
THE THAT WE SAY THIS BUSINESS

00:34:24.328 --> 00:34:25.663
PLAN AND WE SAID IN PRIOR

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:27.598
BUSINESS PLANS. BECAUSE WE GET

00:34:27.665 --> 00:34:29.200
A PORTION OF CAP AND TRADE

00:34:29.267 --> 00:34:31.536
FUNDS NOW. MAKING THAT REVENUE

00:34:31.602 --> 00:34:33.371
SOURCE MORE STABLE AND SECURE

00:34:33.438 --> 00:34:35.206
IS IMPORTANT. SO IF THE

00:34:35.273 --> 00:34:36.474
LEGISLATURE AND ONE OF THE MOST

00:34:36.541 --> 00:34:37.642
STABILIZING THINGS THE

00:34:37.708 --> 00:34:39.610
LEGISLATURE EVER DID. FOR THE

00:34:39.677 --> 00:34:40.912
CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM WAS

00:34:40.978 --> 00:34:43.014
EXTENDED TO TWENTY THIRTY. IF

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:43.748
THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL

00:34:43.815 --> 00:34:46.417
EXTENSION- THIS PROJECT WOULD

00:34:46.484 --> 00:34:48.386
BENEFIT GREATLY FROM. THE

00:34:48.453 --> 00:34:50.455
ABILITY TO FINANCE OFF OF THAT

00:34:50.521 --> 00:34:52.857
REVENUE. STREAM SO WE CAN BRING

00:34:52.924 --> 00:34:55.059
DOLLARS FORWARD SOONER. AND SO

00:34:55.126 --> 00:34:56.894
AN EXTENSION OF CAP AND TRADE

00:34:56.961 --> 00:34:57.728
BEYOND TWENTY THIRTY WOULD BE

00:34:57.795 --> 00:35:00.665
STABILIZING. THE ABILITY TO

00:35:00.731 --> 00:35:01.833
FINANCE OFFER THAT WOULD BE

00:35:01.899 --> 00:35:03.468
STABILIZING. THAT WOULD

00:35:03.534 --> 00:35:05.236
CERTAINLY ALLEVIATE ANY BUDGET

00:35:05.303 --> 00:35:06.971
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE MERCED

00:35:07.038 --> 00:35:10.908
BAKERSFIELD. STRETCH TODAY. YOU

00:35:10.975 --> 00:35:12.276

CANDIDLY WOULD WAIT AND SEE

00:35:18.983 --> 00:35:19.884
WHERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS

ON THIS- I DISAGREE WITH THE.

00:35:24.522 --> 00:35:25.389
THE CHARACTERIZATION THAT THE

00:35:25.456 --> 00:35:27.625
PROJECT HAS NOT GOTTEN ARE NOT

THREE AND A HALF BILLION

00:35:32.363 --> 00:35:33.364
DOLLARS. FROM THE FEDERAL

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ON THIS

00:35:50.448 --> 00:35:52.383
TECHNOLOGY IN THIS PROGRAM.

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:53.751
GOING FORWARD BEFORE I WOULD

HAVE TO ADMIT IS A FORMER NON

00:36:19.944 --> 00:36:22.613
ELECTED AS A LAY PERSON I WAS

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:24.649
STRUCK BY THE HIGH COSTS. WE'VE

00:36:24.715 --> 00:36:27.418
ALL READ ABOUT- IT THE SOARING

00:36:27.485 --> 00:36:28.986
COSTS OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

00:36:29.053 --> 00:36:31.722
PROJECT IN- I APPRECIATED YOUR

BRIEF. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY WERE

00:36:36.661 --> 00:36:38.129
THE COST DRIVERS HE MAIN

00:36:38.195 --> 00:36:40.264
LESSONS YOU TOOK AWAY FROM OUR

00:36:40.331 --> 00:36:41.632
PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES WITH HIGH

00:36:41.699 --> 00:36:44.468
SPEED RAIL AND WHAT ARE YOU

APPRECIATE THAT QUESTION. A LOT

00:36:50.041 --> 00:36:52.109
WE HAVE. THE FIRST BUSINESS

00:36:52.176 --> 00:36:53.778
PLAN I PUT OUT SINCE I'VE BEEN

00:36:53.844 --> 00:36:55.646
HERE TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AT AN

00:36:55.713 --> 00:36:57.348
ENTIRE CHAPTER IN A COLD SWEAT

00:36:57.415 --> 00:37:01.385
LESSONS LEARNED. AND THE KEY

00:37:01.452 --> 00:37:01.986
LESSON LEARNED ON THIS PROJECT

00:37:02.053 --> 00:37:04.221
WAS. WHEN CONSTRUCTION FIRST

00:37:04.288 --> 00:37:04.889
STARTED THERE WAS A LOT OF

00:37:04.956 --> 00:37:06.424
PRESSURE TO SPEND. THE

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:08.259
AVAILABLE FEDERAL FUNDS AND I

00:37:08.326 --> 00:37:10.194
SHOULD SAY THAT AT THAT TIME.

00:37:10.261 --> 00:37:11.596
BECAUSE OF LITIGATION THE

00:37:11.662 --> 00:37:14.432
AUTHORITY DID NOT HAVE ACCESS

00:37:14.498 --> 00:37:15.433
TO OTHER STATE FUNDS AVAILABLE

00:37:15.499 --> 00:37:18.102
FOR THE PROJECT. SO WE HAD DID

00:37:18.169 --> 00:37:19.570
THEY THEY HAD TO RELY AT THAT

00:37:19.637 --> 00:37:22.173
TIME ON AVAILABLE FEDERAL FUNDS

00:37:22.239 --> 00:37:24.942
THAT ALSO HAD. A SPECIFIC

00:37:25.009 --> 00:37:26.544
DEADLINE BY WHICH THOSE HAD TO

00:37:26.611 --> 00:37:29.246
BE SPENT- AND SO WE GOT THEY

00:37:29.313 --> 00:37:30.514
GOT A NEW CONSTRUCTION A LITTLE

00:37:30.581 --> 00:37:32.617
AT A SEQUENCE IS HOW I WOULD

00:37:32.683 --> 00:37:35.486
DESCRIBE- IT MEANS THAT THEY

00:37:35.553 --> 00:37:36.621
STARTED CONSTRUCTION WHERE THEY

00:37:36.687 --> 00:37:38.956
COULD- BUT IT WAS A BIT AT

00:37:39.023 --> 00:37:41.192
RISK. AND WHEN I SAY THAT RISK

00:37:41.258 --> 00:37:42.994
I MEAN. THEY GOT INTO

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:45.062
CONSTRUCTION BEFORE THE

00:37:45.129 --> 00:37:46.998
ENTIRETY OF THE- SEGMENTS WERE

00:37:47.064 --> 00:37:49.667
FULLY DESIGNED. FOR ALL THE

00:37:49.734 --> 00:37:50.134
RIGHT AWAY NEEDS WERE

00:37:50.201 --> 00:37:53.137
UNDERSTOOD. AND AS A RESULT OF

00:37:53.204 --> 00:37:55.773
THAT OVER TIME- THERE'S BEEN

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.642
SCHEDULE DELAYS AS CONTRACTORS

00:37:57.708 --> 00:37:58.209
HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR RIGHT

00:37:58.275 --> 00:38:00.211
AWAY. AND AS DESIGN

00:38:00.277 --> 00:38:01.512
CONSIDERATIONS HAVE BEEN

00:38:01.579 --> 00:38:04.882
FURTHER FURTHER REVIEW- I WILL

00:38:04.949 --> 00:38:05.349
SAY THAT THOSE DESIGN

00:38:05.416 --> 00:38:07.918
CONSIDERATIONS ARE. NOT JUST

00:38:07.985 --> 00:38:09.754
THE- FAULT OF ANYONE PARTY BUT

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:11.622
WHEN YOU DESIGN AND PUT IN

00:38:11.689 --> 00:38:12.790
PLACE A PROGRAM LIKE THIS YOU

00:38:12.857 --> 00:38:15.159
NEGOTIATE. WITH LOCAL PARTNERS

00:38:15.226 --> 00:38:16.894
CITIES AND COUNTIES THE FREIGHT

00:38:16.961 --> 00:38:18.863
UTILITIES AND OTHERS WHO ALL

00:38:18.929 --> 00:38:21.232
PUSH FOR VARIOUS GO CHANGES.

00:38:21.298 --> 00:38:23.401
THOSE WERE NOT ALL IN PLACE AT

00:38:23.467 --> 00:38:25.236
THAT TIME WHEN I STARTED HERE.

00:38:25.302 --> 00:38:27.672
THE CENTRAL VALLEY SEGMENT WAS

00:38:27.738 --> 00:38:30.074
45% DESIGN. IT'S HARD TO KNOW

00:38:30.141 --> 00:38:30.808
HOW MUCH RIGHT AWAY YOU

00:38:30.875 --> 00:38:32.643
ACTUALLY NEED. WHEN YOU'RE ONLY

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:35.413
THAT FAR ALONG. TODAY WE ARE

00:38:35.479 --> 00:38:37.448
95% DESIGN WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT

00:38:37.515 --> 00:38:39.350
WE NEED. TO GET TO CONSTRUCTION

00:38:39.417 --> 00:38:41.285
AND FINISH THIS WORK- AND WE

00:38:41.352 --> 00:38:43.154
ARE NOW OPERATING IN A WAY. TO

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:44.789
GET THAT DONE THE SECOND THING

00:38:44.855 --> 00:38:46.590
I WOULD SAY SO THAT'S KIND OF

00:38:46.657 --> 00:38:50.161
WHERE WE WERE ON THIS PROJECT

00:38:50.227 --> 00:38:50.995
AND HOW IT GOT STARTED. TODAY

00:38:51.062 --> 00:38:51.929
AS I SAID WE HAVE THE RIGHT

00:38:51.996 --> 00:38:54.131
AWAY BETTER IN HAND. WE ARE

00:38:54.198 --> 00:38:56.434
NEARLY A 100% DESIGN WILL BE BY

00:38:56.500 --> 00:39:00.271
APRIL- AND GOING FORWARD. TO

00:39:00.337 --> 00:39:01.305
ENSURE THAT WE WILL NOT MAKE

00:39:01.372 --> 00:39:03.274
THE SAME MISTAKES CHAPTER SIX

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:05.076
OF OUR BUSINESS PLAN. TALKS

00:39:05.142 --> 00:39:06.243
ABOUT A COUPLE THINGS WE'RE

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:08.379
PUTTING IN PLACE. A ONE IS AN

00:39:08.446 --> 00:39:09.447
ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT

00:39:09.513 --> 00:39:11.415
PROGRAM FOR THE AUTHORITY. WILL

00:39:11.482 --> 00:39:12.950
DO MORE DISCIPLINED WORK ON

00:39:13.017 --> 00:39:14.985
UNDERSTANDING WHAT RISKS. ARE

00:39:15.052 --> 00:39:16.387
IN FRONT OF IT. THE WORST

00:39:16.454 --> 00:39:18.155
AVERAGING A RISK COMMITTEE THAT

00:39:18.222 --> 00:39:19.256
WILL REPORT PUBLICLY TO OUR

00:39:19.323 --> 00:39:21.625
BOARD. ABOUT WHERE WE SEE RISKS

00:39:21.692 --> 00:39:23.094
AND WHAT MITIGATION MEASURES

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:24.628
WERE PUTTING IN IN PLACE

00:39:24.695 --> 00:39:26.731
SOONER- AND SECONDLY AND MORE

00:39:26.797 --> 00:39:29.100
IMPORTANTLY. AS WE GET INTO THE

00:39:29.166 --> 00:39:31.669
FUTURE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS-

00:39:31.736 --> 00:39:32.903
WE ARE INSTIGATING SOMETHING

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:34.405
CALLED A STAGE GATE.

00:39:34.472 --> 00:39:35.706
PROCUREMENT PROCESS WHICH

00:39:35.773 --> 00:39:37.575
MEANS. WE WILL ONLY DO THIS IN

00:39:37.641 --> 00:39:39.410
METHODICAL SORT OF INCREMENTAL

00:39:39.477 --> 00:39:41.579
PIECES. THE FIRST IS TO GET THE

00:39:41.645 --> 00:39:43.714
DESIGN WORK FURTHER ADVANCED.

00:39:43.781 --> 00:39:45.049
IDENTIFY THE RIGHT AWAY THAT

00:39:45.116 --> 00:39:46.650
YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE

00:39:46.717 --> 00:39:47.451
UTILITIES THAT NEED TO BE

00:39:47.518 --> 00:39:49.787
RELOCATED. AND DO THOSE THINGS

00:39:49.854 --> 00:39:51.655
FIRST. THEN WE'LL MOVE TO WHAT

00:39:51.722 --> 00:39:53.657
WE CALL THE EARLY WORKS WHICH

00:39:53.724 --> 00:39:54.792
IS ACTUALLY STARTING TO

00:39:54.859 --> 00:39:56.894
PROCURE. THAT RGHT AWAY AND

00:39:56.961 --> 00:39:58.996
STARTING TO EXECUTE THIRD PARTY

00:39:59.063 --> 00:40:00.931
AGREEMENTS AND START TO MOVE-

00:40:00.998 --> 00:40:03.067
THE- UTILITIES THAT NEED TO BE

00:40:03.134 --> 00:40:05.870
MOVED- AND THEN AND ONLY THEN

00:40:05.936 --> 00:40:07.471
WILL WE GET INTO. A

00:40:07.538 --> 00:40:09.039
CONSTRUCTION A PROCUREMENT

00:40:09.106 --> 00:40:11.075
CONTRACTS AND SO CONSTRUCTION

00:40:11.142 --> 00:40:12.910
WILL NOT COMMENCE AT RISK LIKE

00:40:12.977 --> 00:40:15.079
IT DID BEFORE. YEAH AND- WE

00:40:15.146 --> 00:40:16.046
WILL MOVE FORWARD IN A MUCH

00:40:16.113 --> 00:40:17.648
MORE METHODICAL WAY THAT I

00:40:17.715 --> 00:40:19.784
THINK WE'LL HAVE THIS NOT

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:20.351
REPEAT. THE MISTAKES OF THE

00:40:20.417 --> 00:40:21.552
PAST. THANK YOU I REALLY

00:40:21.619 --> 00:40:23.320
APPRECIATE THAT AND THAT MR

IT'S SOMETHING WE CAN'T DO. AND

00:40:52.883 --> 00:40:53.417
TO ME THAT'S NOT AMERICAN WAY

00:40:53.484 --> 00:40:54.185

00:41:08.299 --> 00:41:09.800
OUR LESSONS IN OUR MISTAKES.

00:41:09.867 --> 00:41:11.669

THROUGH NOW ANALYSIS AND PEER

00:50:47.577 --> 00:50:50.147
REVIEW IT'S ESTIMATED TO NEARLY

00:50:50.213 --> 00:50:51.581
DOUBLE THE SYSTEM WIDE

00:50:51.648 --> 00:50:53.116
RIDERSHIP IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY

00:50:53.183 --> 00:50:54.317

JOAQUIN'S. UP SERVICE IT'S

00:50:56.119 --> 00:50:58.321

00:50:58.388 --> 00:51:00.090
TRAVEL TIME SIGNIFICANTLY

00:51:00.157 --> 00:51:01.124
INCREASE RIDERSHIP

00:51:01.191 --> 00:51:04.661

00:51:06.363 --> 00:51:07.764
HOW DO WE GET SOMETHING THAT'S

00:51:07.831 --> 00:51:11.601
OPERATIONALLY BETTER- INSTILL.

00:51:11.668 --> 00:51:13.403
YOU KNOW WE HOPE ACHIEVABLE- IN

00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:15.772
IN THE BUDGET WE HAVE WHAT WHAT

00:51:15.839 --> 00:51:16.840
WE ALSO LIVE WITH A LOT OF

00:51:16.907 --> 00:51:18.308
UNCERTAINTY AND I WHAT I MEAN

00:51:18.375 --> 00:51:20.076
BY THAT IS. YOU KNOW OUR CAP

00:51:20.143 --> 00:51:21.845
AND TRADE DOLLARS ARE HAVE BEEN

00:51:21.912 --> 00:51:23.246
BOLA TIE WITH CERTAIN TIME

00:51:23.313 --> 00:51:25.582
CERTAINLY BEFORE WE EXTENDED IT

00:51:25.649 --> 00:51:27.384
TO. TWENTY THIRTY WAS ALL THE

00:51:27.451 --> 00:51:29.953
TILE AND CERTAINLY THE

00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:31.755
UNEXPECTED GLOBAL PANDEMIC AND

00:51:31.822 --> 00:51:33.857
IMPACT ON THOSE BUT IF THOSE

00:51:33.924 --> 00:51:36.426
DAYS STATE STABLE- AND WE

00:51:36.493 --> 00:51:37.961
RECEIVE THAT FUNDING BETWEEN

00:51:38.028 --> 00:51:40.230
NOW AND TWENTY THIRTY- WE DO

00:51:40.297 --> 00:51:40.730
FEEL LIKE WE CAN GET AN

00:51:40.797 --> 00:51:42.666
OPERATION RUN. IT GOING BETWEEN

00:51:42.732 --> 00:51:44.334
MERCED AND BAKERSFIELD AS THE

00:51:44.401 --> 00:51:46.303
FIRST BUILDING BLOCK AND I

00:51:46.369 --> 00:51:47.537
GUESS THAT'S THE OTHER POINT I

00:51:47.604 --> 00:51:49.172
WANT TO MAKE. THIS IS NOT THE

00:51:49.239 --> 00:51:50.774
END OF THE SYSTEM IT'S THE B.

00:51:50.841 --> 00:51:52.709
BEGINNING. LIKE MOST TRANSIT

00:51:52.776 --> 00:51:54.644
SYSTEMS AROUND. YOU KNOW TAKE

00:51:54.711 --> 00:51:57.047
BART IN THE BAYAREA YOU KNOW

00:51:57.113 --> 00:51:58.615
INITIALLY BAR WAS FUNDED AND

00:51:58.682 --> 00:52:00.951
CONSTRUCTED AS A MOSTLY EAST

00:52:01.017 --> 00:52:03.587
BAY INTO SAN FRANCISCO COMMUTER

00:52:03.653 --> 00:52:07.357
SEGMENT. NOW IT TOUCHES UP.

00:52:07.424 --> 00:52:09.826
MORE CHARGES WERE EVERY AIRPORT

00:52:09.893 --> 00:52:12.028
IN THE BAY AREA AND EXTENDS NOW

00:52:12.095 --> 00:52:13.997
INTO SENATE CLEARANCE AND WE

00:52:14.064 --> 00:52:16.299
SAN JOSE. IT IS NOW GOING ALL

00:52:16.366 --> 00:52:18.034
THROUGHOUT THE BAY AREA THE

00:52:18.101 --> 00:52:19.836
RIDERSHIP NUMBERS ARE MUCH

00:52:19.903 --> 00:52:21.204
DIFFERENT THAN THEY WERE AFTER

00:52:21.271 --> 00:52:23.006
THEIR FIRST BUILDING BLOCK. SO

00:52:23.073 --> 00:52:25.008
SIMILAR WE ARE CONSTRAINED BY

00:52:25.075 --> 00:52:26.276
BUDGET. AND WE HAVE TO

00:52:26.343 --> 00:52:27.911
ARTICULATE WHAT THE NEXT

00:52:27.978 --> 00:52:30.247
SEGMENT PIECES ARE. WE GET A

00:52:30.313 --> 00:52:30.881
LONG TERM FEDERAL FUNDING

00:52:30.947 --> 00:52:33.149
PARTNER ON THIS. I'M LOOKING

00:52:33.216 --> 00:52:33.950
FORWARD TO GETTING INTO THE BAY

00:52:34.017 --> 00:52:36.186
AREA SOONER- BECAUSE THAT'S

00:52:36.253 --> 00:52:38.455
WHEN RIDERSHIP NUMBERS REALLY.

00:52:38.522 --> 00:52:41.358
GO NORTH. NAY IN A BIG WAY- BUT

00:52:41.424 --> 00:52:42.492
WE HAVE ENOUGH TO GET AN

00:52:42.559 --> 00:52:45.295
OPERATING SEGMENT GOING NOW-

00:52:45.362 --> 00:52:46.630
WHAT I CAN. YOU KNOW I DON'T

00:52:46.696 --> 00:52:48.298
MAKE GUARANTEES BUT WHAT I CAN

00:52:48.365 --> 00:52:51.701
SAY IS THAT- I WILL ALWAYS

00:52:51.768 --> 00:52:52.502
EXPRESS IN A TIMELY WAY WHAT

00:52:52.569 --> 00:52:54.304
ARE. THE OPPORTUNITIES AND

00:52:54.371 --> 00:52:55.839
CHALLENGES ARE. AND WE ARE

00:52:55.906 --> 00:52:57.274
COMMITTED TO GET THIS

00:52:57.340 --> 00:52:58.775
OPPORTUNITY SEGMENT GOING IN

00:52:58.842 --> 00:53:00.810

BEST JUDGMENT GOING FORWARD

00:53:02.612 --> 00:53:04.180
ABOUT HOW TO ACHIEVE THAT.

00:53:04.247 --> 00:53:05.682
KNOWING THAT ULTIMATELY WE'RE

00:53:05.749 --> 00:53:07.784
STILL HEADED. FOR A SAN

00:53:07.851 --> 00:53:09.519
FRANCISCO TO LOS ANGELES RUN.

00:53:09.586 --> 00:53:10.787
THAT CAN MOVE PEOPLE BETWEEN

00:53:10.854 --> 00:53:12.222
THOSE TWO POINTS IN UNDER THREE

00:53:12.289 --> 00:53:13.723
HOURS. WE HAVE TO START

00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:15.625
SOMEWHERE WE ONLY HAVE SO MUCH

00:53:15.692 --> 00:53:17.460
BUDGET TODAY. AND WE'RE

00:53:17.527 --> 00:53:18.895

TO GET AN OPERATING RUN GOING

00:53:20.196 --> 00:53:22.032
AS SOON AS WE CAN. RECOGNIZING

00:53:22.098 --> 00:53:24.167

00:54:41.211 --> 00:54:43.346
IT'LL BE MADE UP. MY QUESTION

00:54:43.413 --> 00:54:47.584
IS HOW- AND HOW QUICKLY CAN WE

00:54:47.651 --> 00:54:49.352
GO AHEAD AND NOW XCELERATED.

00:54:49.419 --> 00:54:52.022
THE CONSTRUCTION ACCELERATE-

00:54:52.088 --> 00:54:54.524
THE OVERALL PLANS NOW THAT

00:54:54.591 --> 00:54:56.292
WE'RE CLOSING THE DOOR ON THE

00:54:56.359 --> 00:54:58.728
PANDEMIC HOPEFULLY SO WHAT DOES

00:54:58.795 --> 00:54:59.996
THAT LOOK LIKE OVER THE NEXT

00:55:00.063 --> 00:55:02.132
THREE YEARS AND I'M NOT ASKING

00:55:02.198 --> 00:55:03.333
FOR FIVE OR TEN BECAUSE

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:04.367
OBVIOUSLY IT'S GONNA TAKE A

00:55:04.434 --> 00:55:06.569
LITTLE WHILE. TO LOOK BACK AT

00:55:06.636 --> 00:55:09.139
THE PANDEMIC AND RECOVER FROM

00:55:09.205 --> 00:55:12.008
IT SO GIVE ME AN IDEA OF WHAT

00:55:12.075 --> 00:55:13.410
IT LOOKS LIKE OVER THE NEXT

00:55:13.476 --> 00:55:16.312
THREE YEARS AND FINISH WITH-

00:55:16.379 --> 00:55:17.313
HOW IT CAN HELP THE SOUTHERN%

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:19.382
CALIFORNIA ISSUES- WITH

00:55:19.449 --> 00:55:21.518
TRANSPORTATION AS WE'RE GOING

00:55:21.584 --> 00:55:24.521
ALONG. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I

00:55:24.587 --> 00:55:27.123
THINK THE FIRST ISSUE I WOULD

00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:28.191
ADDRESS WAS THE QUESTION ABOUT

00:55:28.258 --> 00:55:30.493
THE- CAP AND TRADE REVENUE WE

00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:33.196
DID TAKE A HIT IN TWENTY TWENTY

00:55:33.263 --> 00:55:34.597
BECAUSE THE OPTIONS.

00:55:34.664 --> 00:55:35.765
PARTICULARLY THE SINGULAR

00:55:35.832 --> 00:55:38.301
AUCTION RIGHT AFTER THEY OPEN.

00:55:38.368 --> 00:55:40.136
A PANDEMIC STRUCK IN MARCH OF

00:55:40.203 --> 00:55:42.205
TWENTY. I THINK THAT SUBSEQUENT

00:55:42.272 --> 00:55:43.940
AUCTION WAS MAY AND IN THAT ARE

00:55:44.007 --> 00:55:46.509
SHOULD WE- RECEIVED ONLY SIX

00:55:46.576 --> 00:55:48.111
MILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS

00:55:48.178 --> 00:55:50.146
PROJECT OUT OF THAT ARCHER. NOW

00:55:50.213 --> 00:55:51.948
TYPICALLY WE HAD BEEN ON A PACE

00:55:52.015 --> 00:55:53.349
WHERE WE WERE RECEIVING MORE

00:55:53.416 --> 00:55:55.051
LIKE A HUNDRED AND SIXTY

00:55:55.118 --> 00:55:57.987
MILLION PER AUCTION. AND IN

00:55:58.054 --> 00:55:59.622
THAT WHEN WE GET SIX SO.

00:55:59.689 --> 00:56:01.157
SUBSEQUENT AUCTIONS HAVE GOTTEN

00:56:01.224 --> 00:56:02.992
BETTER THE CAP AND TRADE MARKET

00:56:03.059 --> 00:56:04.661
IS STABILIZING. YEAH BY

00:56:04.728 --> 00:56:06.029
EVIDENCE OF THE SUBSEQUENT

00:56:06.096 --> 00:56:07.530
AUCTIONS THAT ARE BROUGHT THE-

00:56:07.597 --> 00:56:10.133
REVENUE BACK. TO OUR PROGRAM

00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:11.468
HEADING BACK TO WHERE IT WAS

00:56:11.534 --> 00:56:13.369
PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC. THE

00:56:13.436 --> 00:56:15.071
REASON WE SAY WE ULTIMATELY

00:56:15.138 --> 00:56:16.806
WILL MAKE UP A LARGE PART OF

00:56:16.873 --> 00:56:17.907
THAT TWO EIGHTY EIGHT THAT WAS

00:56:17.974 --> 00:56:19.809
LOST. IS THE WAY THE ARCH

00:56:19.876 --> 00:56:22.812
INWARDS WORKS THESE ALLOWANCES-

00:56:22.879 --> 00:56:25.348
GET SOLD WHAT HAPPENED ON THE

00:56:25.415 --> 00:56:27.650
IMMEDIATE- THE IMMEDIATE

00:56:27.717 --> 00:56:29.252
AUCTION AFTER THE COVERT

00:56:29.319 --> 00:56:30.453
NINETEEN WAS THAT. THOSE

00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:33.089
ALLOWANCES DID NOT GET SOLD-

00:56:33.156 --> 00:56:35.892
HOWEVER. OVER TIME AS LONG AS

00:56:35.959 --> 00:56:37.460
THE AUCTIONS AND I'M NOT NOT

00:56:37.527 --> 00:56:38.661
THIS REALLY THE EXPERT IN THIS

00:56:38.728 --> 00:56:41.731
MARKET MECHANICS. BUT AS THOSE

00:56:41.798 --> 00:56:43.767
AS ALL AVAILABLE ALLOWANCE

00:56:43.833 --> 00:56:45.101

BUY UP ALLOWANCES THAT WERE

00:56:52.275 --> 00:56:54.544
PREVIOUSLY ON SO. AND SO OUR

00:56:54.611 --> 00:56:57.580
EXPECTATION JUST AS WE- SAW SAW

00:56:57.647 --> 00:57:01.284
BEFORE- IS THAT GOING FORWARD-

00:57:01.351 --> 00:57:08.291
THE ALLOWANCES WILL. GET SOLD.

00:57:08.358 --> 00:57:09.793
AND WE WILL MAKE UP THE LOS. A

00:57:09.859 --> 00:57:10.326
TWO EIGHTY A SO IT IT DOES

00:57:10.393 --> 00:57:11.761
PRESENT A IS A FLOW. IT'S

00:57:11.828 --> 00:57:12.529
TELLING EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION

00:57:12.595 --> 00:57:14.464
DOLLAS WITH WE'D HAVE THE BANK.

00:57:14.531 --> 00:57:16.666
TODAY WE DO NOT AND SO AGAIN

00:57:16.733 --> 00:57:17.767
THE WAY THE MARKET MECHANISM

00:57:17.834 --> 00:57:20.503
WORKS WE SEE THAT GETTING THAT

00:57:20.570 --> 00:57:21.604
OVER TIME WITH THE ALLOWANCES

00:57:21.671 --> 00:57:23.206
GETS ALL. IN TERMS OF

00:57:23.273 --> 00:57:25.809
DESCRIBING HOW THINGS WILL LOOK

00:57:25.875 --> 00:57:26.810
OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT.

00:57:26.876 --> 00:57:28.344
YOU YEARS AYE AYE I WOULD SAY

00:57:28.411 --> 00:57:31.881
THIS- YOU WILL SEE IS COMPLETE.

00:57:31.948 --> 00:57:33.716
OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS YOU

00:57:33.783 --> 00:57:36.152
WILL SEE IS COMPLETE. THE

00:57:36.219 --> 00:57:37.287
CONSTRUCTION WORK THAT IS

00:57:37.353 --> 00:57:38.822
UNDERWAY CURRENTLY IN THE

00:57:38.888 --> 00:57:40.623
VALLEY THE HUNDRED NINETY MILE.

00:57:40.690 --> 00:57:41.958
CONSTRUCTION WORK WILL GET

00:57:42.025 --> 00:57:44.160
DONE. WE WILL COMMENCE THE WORK

00:57:44.227 --> 00:57:45.728
TO LAY DOWN A TRACKWE BELIEVE

00:57:45.795 --> 00:57:47.597
THAT TRACK. SHOULD BE

00:57:47.664 --> 00:57:50.133
ELECTRIFIED IN PREPARED. FOR A

00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:52.035
LECTURE ELECTRIFIED SERVICES.

00:57:52.101 --> 00:57:53.636
BOB WE HAVE TWO BIDDERS THAT

00:57:53.703 --> 00:57:56.005
ARE OUT IN THE MARKET NOW. THAT

00:57:56.072 --> 00:57:57.207
ARE BIDDING ON DOING THE

00:57:57.273 --> 00:58:00.410
TRACKING SYSTEMS WORK. AND OUR

00:58:00.476 --> 00:58:01.711
BOARD WILL RECEIVE THOSE BIDS

00:58:01.778 --> 00:58:03.413
LATER THIS YEAR. AND WE WILL

00:58:03.479 --> 00:58:05.048
EVALUATE HOW TO GO FORWARD ON

00:58:05.114 --> 00:58:07.851
THOSE OUR HOPE. IS THAT WE ARE

00:58:07.917 --> 00:58:09.485
CONSIDERING HAVING THEM BIT IT.

00:58:09.552 --> 00:58:11.254
AS ONE TRACK FIRST AND A SECOND

00:58:11.321 --> 00:58:13.590
TRACK LATER- THAT IS A WAY TO

00:58:13.656 --> 00:58:15.992
SAVE SHORT TERM DOLLARS. AND

00:58:16.059 --> 00:58:16.926
GET AN OPERATIONAL SYSTEM

00:58:16.993 --> 00:58:19.762
GOING- BUT WE WANT TO COMPARE

00:58:19.829 --> 00:58:20.630
WHAT THOSE COST DIFFERENCES

00:58:20.697 --> 00:58:22.866
WILL BE. THE IDEA IS TO TAKE A

00:58:22.932 --> 00:58:24.434
CAREFUL APPROACH ON THIS. AND

00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:27.403
DO THIS METHODICALLY- AT THE

00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:29.038
SAME TIME YOU WILL ALSO SEE THE

00:58:29.105 --> 00:58:31.007
COURSE THE NEXT EIGHTEEN TO

00:58:31.074 --> 00:58:32.609
TWENTY FOUR MONTHS US COMPLETE.

00:58:32.675 --> 00:58:34.811
THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK FROM SAN

00:58:34.878 --> 00:58:36.012
FRANCISCO ALL THE WAY TO LA AND

00:58:36.079 --> 00:58:38.248
ANAHEIM. THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT

00:58:38.314 --> 00:58:39.883
MILESTONE BECAUSE WHEN WE DO

00:58:39.949 --> 00:58:42.085
THAT. WE CAN THEN START ON ALL

00:58:42.151 --> 00:58:43.920
THE SEGMENTS TO ADVANCE THE

00:58:43.987 --> 00:58:45.788
DESIGN WORK EARLY. A START TO

00:58:45.855 --> 00:58:47.457
IDENTIFY WHAT THE NEEDS ARE IN

00:58:47.523 --> 00:58:49.392
EACH SEGMENT. AND WHEN I SAY

00:58:49.459 --> 00:58:51.728
NEEDS I MEAN. RIGHT AWAY MAKING

00:58:51.794 --> 00:58:53.062
SURE THE DESIGN IS MOVING

00:58:53.129 --> 00:58:54.564
FORWARD IN A PLACE IN A WAY

00:58:54.631 --> 00:58:55.765
THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH

00:58:55.832 --> 00:58:57.901
COMMUNITY WANTS. BUT AGAIN

00:58:57.967 --> 00:58:59.269
IDENTIFYING FUTURE RIGHT AWAY

00:58:59.335 --> 00:59:00.603
WHAT UTILITIES NEED TO BE

00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:03.206
RELOCATED- WHAT KIND OF THIRD

00:59:03.273 --> 00:59:04.307
PARTY AGREEMENTS DO WE HAVE TO

00:59:04.374 --> 00:59:06.276
ENTER INTO. TO GET THAT WORK

00:59:06.342 --> 00:59:08.211
DONE. AND REALLY AND THIS IS

00:59:08.278 --> 00:59:10.413
IMPORTANT. ALLOWING US TO DO

00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:11.981
THAT TRYING TO WORK SO THAT WE

00:59:12.048 --> 00:59:13.750
CAN REFINE COST ESTIMATES AND

00:59:13.816 --> 00:59:15.585
YOU CAN ONLY DO THAT WHEN YOU

00:59:15.652 --> 00:59:17.453
ADVANCE THE DESIGN. FURTHER AND

00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:19.055
SO THOSE THOSE ARE IMPORTANT

00:59:19.122 --> 00:59:20.790
STEPS WILL BE TAKING IN EACH

00:59:20.857 --> 00:59:23.860
SEGMENT. AS THE ENVIRONMENT

00:59:23.927 --> 00:59:26.763
WORK. COMPLETES I WANT TO DO I

00:59:26.829 --> 00:59:28.031

THE SINGLE TRACK GIVE ME AN

01:00:20.416 --> 01:00:21.851
IDEA HOW THAT ARE TO LET IF WE

01:00:21.918 --> 01:00:23.953
CAN- JUST. KEEP IT TO ONE

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:24.854

ALSO THAT I THINK SENATOR

01:00:48.911 --> 01:00:50.913
ARCHULETA. WANTED TO BRING UP

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:53.082

01:00:53.149 --> 01:00:54.283
SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN GET BACK

01:00:54.350 --> 01:00:56.052
TO US ON BET. THE CAPITAL

01:00:56.119 --> 01:00:58.721
INVESTMENT PLAN FOR YOUR GOING

01:00:58.788 --> 01:01:00.623
TO COMPLETE THIS SEGMENT. WAS

01:01:00.690 --> 01:01:03.793
JUST ONE TRACK. ABA MAKES SOME

01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:05.461
SENSE TO CUT THE COSTS BUT AS

01:01:05.528 --> 01:01:07.764
WE GO FORWARD. AT SOME POINT IN

01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:09.165
TIME WE'LL BE LOOKING AT

01:01:09.232 --> 01:01:11.501
OPERATIONS SITUATION. AND I AM

01:01:11.567 --> 01:01:13.569
CONCERNED THAT WE WON'T BE ABLE

01:01:13.636 --> 01:01:14.670
TO CONSIDER THIS HIGH SPEED

01:01:14.737 --> 01:01:17.173
RAIL. AND ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:19.509
WRITERS TO BE ON IT. AND THOSE

01:01:19.575 --> 01:01:20.777
REVENUES WILL BE VERY VERY

01:01:20.843 --> 01:01:23.479
IMPORTANT. IN TAKING A LOOK AT

01:01:23.546 --> 01:01:24.514
THE REDUCTION OF THE CAPITAL

01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:26.649
INVESTMENT. AND ALSO OPERATIONS

01:01:26.716 --> 01:01:28.217
GOING FORWARD. SO IT'S

01:01:28.284 --> 01:01:29.685
SOMETHING I THINK OF NOT TODAY

01:01:29.752 --> 01:01:31.587
I'D LIKE TO HAVE A FURTHER.

CAN BE DONE BY THE- EXCITEMENT

01:02:34.984 --> 01:02:36.385
AND THE INSPIRATION OF HAVING

01:02:36.452 --> 01:02:40.490
THE US STATE OF A STATE WIDE A

01:02:40.556 --> 01:02:41.224
PROJECT LIKE THIS BEING

01:02:41.290 --> 01:02:43.493
COMPLETED AND I DO BELIEVE IN

SIDE OF MAKING SURE THAT WE DO

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:53.402
THE IMPOSSIBLE- IT APPEARS

01:02:53.469 --> 01:02:55.705
THAT. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WERE

01:02:55.771 --> 01:02:57.006
WERE SORT OF HOPING AND PRAYING

01:02:57.073 --> 01:02:59.575
THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE SUCH A OF

01:02:59.642 --> 01:03:01.244
WELCOMING ADMINISTRATION AS THE

01:03:01.310 --> 01:03:02.612
BY THE MINISTRATION THAT

01:03:02.678 --> 01:03:03.279
SOMEHOW WE'RE GOING TO GET

01:03:03.346 --> 01:03:05.381
FUNDING THERE WE KNOW THAT CAP

01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:08.918

01:03:08.985 --> 01:03:10.820

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:16.893
ONE HAND STILL ASSUMES

01:03:16.959 --> 01:03:19.128
COMPLETION OF THE VALLEY TO

01:03:19.195 --> 01:03:21.197
VALLEY LINE BY TWENTY THIRTY

01:03:21.264 --> 01:03:22.765
ONE AND THE SERVICES GO TO LA

01:03:22.832 --> 01:03:24.901
BY TWENTY THIRTY THREE I

01:03:24.967 --> 01:03:27.103
HAVEN'T HEARD YET REALLY HOW

01:03:28.604 --> 01:03:30.506
HOW YOU GONNA MEET SUCH AN

01:03:30.573 --> 01:03:33.409
AMBITIOUS ODD TIME LINE- AND I

01:03:33.476 --> 01:03:34.010
THINK THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER

01:03:34.076 --> 01:03:38.147
OF ISSUES RAISED. BY THE-

01:03:38.214 --> 01:03:41.083
SENATOR FROM. SAN JOSE- THAT WE

01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:42.785
REALLY HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION

01:03:42.852 --> 01:03:45.488
TO- THE KIND OF DESIGN THAT WAS

01:03:45.555 --> 01:03:47.857
BUILT I MEAN. YOU YOURSELF

PROPOSAL WAS TO AN ORCHARD AND

01:03:54.597 --> 01:03:56.832
UP IN AN ORCHARD I JUST. THINK

01:03:56.899 --> 01:04:00.069
THOSE ARE VERY- IRRESPONSIBLE

01:04:00.136 --> 01:04:02.572
SO- AGAIN IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S

01:04:02.638 --> 01:04:03.940
A LOT OF HOLES HERE WHEN IT

01:04:04.006 --> 01:04:06.108

01:04:17.853 --> 01:04:18.854
WE ARE MOVING FORWARD IN A

01:04:18.921 --> 01:04:20.856
BUILDING BLOCK APPROACH WE LOOK

01:04:20.923 --> 01:04:22.391
AT THE REVENUES THAT WE SEE

01:04:22.458 --> 01:04:24.093
AVAILABLE TO THE PROGRAM BUT

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:26.162
TODAY IT IS WHY WE ARE

01:04:26.229 --> 01:04:28.097
PROPOSING TO GET BEYOND THE

01:04:28.164 --> 01:04:29.265
HUNDRED NINETEEN MILES THAT WAS

01:04:29.332 --> 01:04:30.499
IN THE FEDERAL GRANT AGREEMENT

01:04:30.566 --> 01:04:32.802

01:04:32.868 --> 01:04:34.370
CENTRAL VALLEY FOR AN OPERATING

01:04:34.437 --> 01:04:35.938
RUN THAT MAKES SENSE THAT WOULD

01:04:36.005 --> 01:04:36.806
GIVE CALIFORNIA'S THE

01:04:45.982 --> 01:04:47.817
THERE'S NO QUESTION AND WE SET

THAT'S FACING THE LEGISLATURE

A NATURAL OPPORTUNITY FOR THE

OPPORTUNITY MAY NOT EMERGE FOR

01:07:17.666 --> 01:07:19.201
SEVERAL YEARS. FROM OUR

01:07:19.268 --> 01:07:20.469
PERSPECTIVE THERE ARE TWO KEY

01:07:20.536 --> 01:07:21.237
CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE

01:07:21.303 --> 01:07:22.872
LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER AS IT

01:07:22.938 --> 01:07:24.206
MAKES DECISIONS ABOUT THIS

01:07:24.273 --> 01:07:26.442

01:07:26.509 --> 01:07:27.510
THE LEGISLATURE WANT TO

01:07:27.576 --> 01:07:28.677
CONSIDER ITS LEVEL OF

01:07:28.744 --> 01:07:30.045
CONFIDENCE THAT AVAILABLE

01:07:30.112 --> 01:07:31.514
FUNDING WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:34.383
SUPPORT THE MERCED TO

01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:35.184
BAKERSFIELD SEGMENT. SO I DO

01:07:35.251 --> 01:07:37.086
HEARD THE LAST. THE THIRTY X.

01:07:37.153 --> 01:07:38.988
THAT THE EXIST FUNDING BE ROUGH

01:07:39.054 --> 01:07:40.790
STIFF. TO COMPLETE THE REVISED

01:07:40.856 --> 01:07:41.657
SCOPE OF THAT WERE SENT TO

01:07:41.724 --> 01:07:42.858
BAKERSFIELD SEGMENT. AS YOU

01:07:42.925 --> 01:07:44.093
ALSO HEARD THAT'S REALLY A

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:46.228
SINGLE TRACK WITH PROBABLY

01:07:46.295 --> 01:07:47.897
PRETTY BASIC STATION PLATFORMS.

01:07:47.963 --> 01:07:49.532
HOWEVER HISTORICALLY PROJECT

01:07:49.598 --> 01:07:51.300
COSTS HAVE INCREASED OVER TIME

01:07:51.367 --> 01:07:55.938
FOR THIS PROJECT. THE EXPECTED

01:07:56.005 --> 01:07:57.273
FINDING WHAT MATERIALIZE FOR

01:07:57.339 --> 01:07:58.340
EXAMPLE WE HEARD ABOUT CAP AND

01:07:58.407 --> 01:07:59.975
TRADE AND HOW IN CERTAIN THAT

01:08:00.042 --> 01:08:03.446
POTENTIALLY COULD BE- SO I

01:08:03.512 --> 01:08:06.182
WOULD KNOW THAT. THAT IF THAT

01:08:06.248 --> 01:08:08.284
HAPPENS AT THE EXISTING FUNDING

01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:09.418
MIGHT NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO

01:08:09.485 --> 01:08:11.220
COMPLETE EVEN THE MERCED TO

01:08:11.287 --> 01:08:13.022

THE PROJECT THIS INCLUDES ITS

01:08:17.159 --> 01:08:18.160
LEVEL OF COMMITMENT TO MEETING

01:08:18.227 --> 01:08:19.829
A FUNDING GAP IF ANY THAT COULD

01:08:19.895 --> 01:08:20.830
EMERGE IN CONSTRUCTING THE

01:08:20.896 --> 01:08:22.731
RECEPTIVE BAKERSFIELD SEGMENT.

01:08:22.798 --> 01:08:23.833
AS WELL AS ITS COMMITMENT TO

01:08:23.899 --> 01:08:25.401
MEETING DEFINING FUTURE

01:08:25.468 --> 01:08:26.869
SEGMENTS SUCH AS THE BALLOT

01:08:26.936 --> 01:08:30.406
VALLEY LINE IN PHASE ONE WHICH

01:08:30.473 --> 01:08:30.940
WILL CERTAINLY REQUIRE NEW

01:08:31.006 --> 01:08:32.074
FUNDING SOURCES. IF THE

01:08:32.141 --> 01:08:33.175
LEGISLATURE IS COMMITTED TO

01:08:33.242 --> 01:08:34.210
FINDING WERE SENT TO BACKERS

01:08:34.276 --> 01:08:35.411
FIELD EVEN IF THE FUNDING GAP

01:08:35.478 --> 01:08:37.246
EMERGES. AND IS ALSO COMMITTED

01:08:37.313 --> 01:08:38.447
TO FINDING FUTURE PROJECTS

01:08:38.514 --> 01:08:39.815
SEGMENT. THAT WE THINK THAT

01:08:39.882 --> 01:08:40.983
ORTIZ APPROACH APPEARS

01:08:41.050 --> 01:08:42.117
REASONABLE AND LIKELY MAKE

01:08:42.184 --> 01:08:43.519
SENSE TO APPROPRIATE THE

01:08:43.586 --> 01:08:44.620
FUNDING THAT'S EXPECTED TO BE

01:08:44.687 --> 01:08:46.155
REQUESTED BY THE AUTHORITY.

01:08:46.222 --> 01:08:47.389
HOWEVER IF THE LEGISLATURE

01:08:47.456 --> 01:08:48.357
DOESN'T WANT TO MAKE A

01:08:48.424 --> 01:08:49.725
COMMITMENT TO FINDING MERCED TO

01:08:49.792 --> 01:08:51.160
BAKERSFIELD AND FUTURE SEGMENTS

01:08:51.227 --> 01:08:52.962
AT THIS TIME. WE SUGGESTED MAY

01:08:53.028 --> 01:08:54.063
WANT TO TAKE ANOTHER APPROACH

01:08:54.129 --> 01:08:55.531
TO MAXIMIZE THE STANDALONE

01:08:55.598 --> 01:08:56.298
VALUE OF WHATEVER

01:08:56.365 --> 01:08:57.800
INFRASTRUCTURE IS COMPLETED.

01:08:57.867 --> 01:08:59.101
AND ALSO PROVIDE THE

01:08:59.168 --> 01:08:59.802
LEGISLATURE WITH FUTURE

01:08:59.869 --> 01:09:01.904
FLEXIBILITY. IN THIS CASE WE

01:09:01.971 --> 01:09:02.805
THINK THERE ARE TWO MAIN

01:09:02.872 --> 01:09:05.841
OPTIONS. FIRST THE LEGISLATURE

01:09:05.908 --> 01:09:06.375
IF THE LEGISLATURE HAD THE

01:09:06.442 --> 01:09:07.910
SPECIFIC ALTERNATIVE APPROACH

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:09.445
THAT IT WOULD LIKE TO PURSUE

01:09:09.512 --> 01:09:10.379
FOR EXAMPLE NARROWING THE

01:09:10.446 --> 01:09:11.647
PROJECT SCOPE TO WHAT'S

01:09:11.714 --> 01:09:12.848
REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL GRANT

01:09:12.915 --> 01:09:14.016
AGREEMENT AND THAT'S BASICALLY.

01:09:14.083 --> 01:09:16.218
BASIC TRACK IN THAT ONE

01:09:16.285 --> 01:09:17.786
NINETEEN MILES. IT COULD ADOPT

01:09:17.853 --> 01:09:19.688
STATUTORY LANGUAGE DIRECTING

01:09:19.755 --> 01:09:21.323
THE AUTHORITY ACCORDINGLY.

01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:22.191
SECOND IF THE LEGISLATURE

01:09:22.258 --> 01:09:23.726
DOESN'T HAVE A SPECIFIC

01:09:23.792 --> 01:09:24.326
APPROACH THAT WOULD LIKE TO

01:09:24.393 --> 01:09:26.295
COMMIT TO AT THIS TIME- FOR

01:09:26.362 --> 01:09:27.263
EXAMPLE IF YOU'D LIKE TO FIND

01:09:27.329 --> 01:09:28.130
OUT WHAT THE FEDERAL

01:09:28.197 --> 01:09:31.267
GOVERNMENT'S GOING TO DO BEFORE

01:09:31.333 --> 01:09:31.967
YOU MAKE DECISIONS- YOU CAN.

01:09:32.034 --> 01:09:32.868
ACTION TO PRESERVE YOUR

01:09:32.935 --> 01:09:35.404
FLEXIBILITY. THIS WOULD LIKELY

01:09:35.471 --> 01:09:37.139
INCLUDE DELAYING ACTION ON SOME

01:09:37.206 --> 01:09:38.173
OR ALL OF THE APPROPRIATIONS

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:39.842
REQUEST AND THIS WOULD PRESERVE

01:09:39.909 --> 01:09:41.176
AND ASTRAL DECISION MAKING

01:09:41.243 --> 01:09:43.312
POINT FOR YOU. I WOULD ALSO

01:09:43.379 --> 01:09:44.480
LIKE NINGALOO DEDUCTING

01:09:44.547 --> 01:09:46.115
STATUTORY LANGUAGE PREVENTING

01:09:46.181 --> 01:09:46.882
THE AUTHORITY FROM ENTERING

01:09:46.949 --> 01:09:47.850
INTO CONTRACTS THAT WOULD

01:09:47.917 --> 01:09:49.718
COMMIT THE STATE TO A SPECIFIC

01:09:49.785 --> 01:09:50.119
APPROACH SUCH AS

01:09:50.185 --> 01:09:52.454
ELECTRIFICATION. SO FOR EXAMPLE

01:09:52.521 --> 01:09:53.489
YOU COULD PREVENT THE AUTHORITY

01:09:53.556 --> 01:09:54.590
FROM PURCHASING LIKE A FIVE

01:09:54.657 --> 01:09:56.091
ROLLING STOCK AT THIS TIME OR

01:09:56.158 --> 01:09:57.860
COMMIT COMMITTING THE STATE TO

01:09:57.927 --> 01:09:59.194
CONSTRUCTING ELECTRIFY TRACK

01:09:59.261 --> 01:10:02.565
AND SYSTEMS I'M HAPPY TO TAKE

01:10:02.631 --> 01:10:04.967
ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISS

01:10:05.034 --> 01:10:06.335
CHRISTINE WE APPRECIATE THAT.

01:10:06.402 --> 01:10:08.370
UP NEXT WE HAVE LOU THOMPSON

YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY THAT I

01:10:24.353 --> 01:10:25.721
HAVE TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU TODAY

01:10:25.788 --> 01:10:27.990
I ALWAYS ENJOYED THIS

01:10:28.057 --> 01:10:30.159
OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE-

01:10:30.225 --> 01:10:31.694
HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT AS YOU

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:33.596
MAY KNOW. THE ROLE OF THE PEER

01:10:33.662 --> 01:10:34.663
REVIEW GROUP WHICH WAS

01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:37.967
ESTABLISHED IN OF PROP ONE A OR

01:10:38.033 --> 01:10:39.835
A B. THREE OF TWENTY FOUR. IS

01:10:39.902 --> 01:10:41.503
TO PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH

01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:42.805
COMMENTS ON HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:10:42.871 --> 01:10:44.673
REPORTS AND PROPOSALS AND I

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:46.742
HOPE THAT THESE REPORTS CAN ADD

01:10:46.809 --> 01:10:48.744
TO THE DISCUSSION TODAY. OUR

01:10:48.811 --> 01:10:50.679
LETTER COMMENTING ON THE DRAFT

01:10:50.746 --> 01:10:52.948
REVISED BUSINESS PLAN WAS SENT

01:10:53.015 --> 01:10:54.750
ON THE TWELFTH OF MARCH INFORMS

01:10:54.817 --> 01:10:57.319
THE BACKGROUND OF MY REMARKS

01:10:57.386 --> 01:10:59.588
THE DAY. LET ME BEGIN BY SAYING

01:10:59.655 --> 01:11:01.724
THAT THERE IS SOME PROGRESS OR

01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:03.626
POSITIVE NEWS TO REPORT OF

01:11:03.692 --> 01:11:05.361
RIGHT AWAY AND THE THIRD PARTY

01:11:05.427 --> 01:11:06.362
AGREEMENTS ARE COMING UNDER

01:11:06.428 --> 01:11:07.930
CONTROL. AND THAT IS

01:11:07.997 --> 01:11:09.365
CONTRIBUTING TO GETTING THE

01:11:09.431 --> 01:11:11.233
EXISTING CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM

01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:14.236
UNDER BETTER CONTROL. I DO HAVE

01:11:14.303 --> 01:11:15.504
TO ADD THOUGH THAT THE EXISTING

01:11:15.571 --> 01:11:17.539
CONTRACTS HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT

01:11:17.606 --> 01:11:20.275
OVERRUNS AND BUDGET AROUND 70%

01:11:20.342 --> 01:11:22.511
ON AVERAGE. AND THE SCHEDULE

01:11:22.578 --> 01:11:24.213
DUE TO HASTE IN GETTING STARTED

01:11:24.279 --> 01:11:26.148
FUTURE CONTRACTS WILL BENEFIT

01:11:26.215 --> 01:11:28.550
FROM THE LESSONS LEARNED BUT

01:11:28.617 --> 01:11:29.685
THEY HAVE BEEN PAINFUL. THE

01:11:29.752 --> 01:11:30.986
IMBALANCE BETWEEN THE STATE'S

01:11:31.053 --> 01:11:33.022
STANFORD CONTRACTORS IS BEING

01:11:33.088 --> 01:11:35.357
IMPROVED IN FAVOR OF A LARGER

01:11:35.424 --> 01:11:37.860
STUDY PARTICIPATION WHICH IS A

01:11:37.926 --> 01:11:40.195
GOOD IDEA. THE STAGE GATE

01:11:40.262 --> 01:11:41.997
MANAGEMENT APPROACH WILL HELP

01:11:42.064 --> 01:11:43.932
TO ENSURE THAT FUTURE CONTRACTS

01:11:43.999 --> 01:11:45.100
WILL PROCEED IN THE RIGHT

01:11:45.167 --> 01:11:46.935
SEQUENCE REDUCING DELAYS AND

01:11:47.002 --> 01:11:48.904
COSTLY CHANGE ORDERS AS BRIAN

01:11:48.971 --> 01:11:51.006
MENTIONED. THE BIDEN

01:11:51.073 --> 01:11:53.008
MINISTRATION IS LIKELY TO

01:11:53.075 --> 01:11:54.777
CONSIDER REQUESTS TO RELAX

01:11:54.843 --> 01:11:56.578
DECEMBER TWENTY TWO ERA

01:11:56.645 --> 01:12:00.249
DEADLINE CAN BE RE OBLIGATE THE

01:12:00.315 --> 01:12:00.749
NINE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE

01:12:00.816 --> 01:12:01.884
MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL

01:12:01.950 --> 01:12:04.920
FISCAL TWO OH ONE NO. FUNDING

01:12:04.987 --> 01:12:07.823
MORE BROADLY THERE IS MORE

01:12:07.890 --> 01:12:10.259
REALISM AND WHAT THE AUTHORITY

01:12:10.325 --> 01:12:12.695
SAYS IT CAN AND CANNOT DO.

01:12:12.761 --> 01:12:13.996
THERE IS REASON TO BELIEVE THAT

01:12:14.063 --> 01:12:15.130
THEY CAN COMPLETE WITH THE

01:12:15.197 --> 01:12:17.166
EXISTING FUNDING OBLIGATIONS

01:12:17.232 --> 01:12:19.101
UNDER THEIR AGREEMENTS WHICH IS

01:12:19.168 --> 01:12:20.703
A HUNDRED NINETEEN MILES TO

01:12:20.769 --> 01:12:22.304
DRIVE MY ONLY SECTION OF A

01:12:22.371 --> 01:12:23.872
TRACTOR. AND THEY COULD

01:12:23.939 --> 01:12:26.408
PROBABLY ADD ELECTRIFICATION TO

01:12:26.475 --> 01:12:27.609
THE HUNDRED NINETEEN MILE

01:12:27.676 --> 01:12:29.578

LINKS TO MERCED AND BAKERSFIELD

01:12:36.852 --> 01:12:39.354
AND THE MORE DIFFICULT WORK

01:12:39.421 --> 01:12:39.955
TUNNELING OUTSIDE THE CENTRAL

01:12:40.022 --> 01:12:43.258
VALLEY. BUT THE ABILITY TO

01:12:43.325 --> 01:12:44.693
COMPLETE THE PROPOSED LINKS

01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:46.662
FROM THE DEER TO MERCED AND

01:12:46.729 --> 01:12:47.996
FROM POPLAR AVENUE IN THE

01:12:48.063 --> 01:12:49.832
BAKERSFIELD IS MORE OF A

01:12:49.898 --> 01:12:51.166
CHALLENGE FOR A NUMBER OF

01:12:51.233 --> 01:12:54.069
REASONS. FIRST PROJECTED COST

01:12:54.136 --> 01:12:55.337
TO COMPLETE THE AUTHORITIES

01:12:55.404 --> 01:12:56.872
WORK ARE VERY CLOSE TO THE

01:12:56.939 --> 01:12:58.907
MAXIMUM POTENTIAL FUNDING NOW

01:12:58.974 --> 01:13:01.176
AVAILABLE. IN THIS IS BEFORE

01:13:01.243 --> 01:13:03.412
ADDING A REALISTIC ALLOWANCE

01:13:03.479 --> 01:13:05.214
FOR OVERRUNS OF WORK FOR WHICH

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:07.983
THE ENGINEERING IS FAR FROM

01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:09.551
FULLY DETAILED. THERE IS A

01:13:09.618 --> 01:13:11.820
SIGNIFICANT POSSIBILITY THAT

01:13:11.887 --> 01:13:13.689
HEADED FUNDING BEYOND EXISTING

01:13:13.756 --> 01:13:15.491
SOURCES MAY BE REQUIRED

01:13:15.557 --> 01:13:18.060
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE PROJECT

01:13:18.127 --> 01:13:19.528
HAS NOT YET TAKEN ON

01:13:19.595 --> 01:13:22.231
ELECTRIFICATION SIGNALLING OR

SYSTEM BETWEEN MERCED AND

01:13:27.269 --> 01:13:28.670
BAKERSFIELD IS BASED ON A

01:13:28.737 --> 01:13:30.706
COMPLEX SET OF AGREEMENTS AND

01:13:30.773 --> 01:13:32.374
ACTIONS AMONG HIGH SPEED RAIL

AN OPERATING THAT'S ALREADY

01:13:49.758 --> 01:13:51.226
THAT WOULD AGREE TO PAY FULL

COSTS FOR USE OF THE LIME. AND

01:13:54.930 --> 01:13:55.464
ROLLING STOCK PURCHASE BY THE

01:13:57.566 --> 01:13:59.067
SUPPORTS THE SAID WORKING JOINT

POWERS AUTHORITY. OPERATING THE

01:14:04.139 --> 01:14:05.707
THAT THE STATE WILL ULTIMATELY

01:14:05.774 --> 01:14:08.177
BE ON THE HOOK. FOR WHATEVER OR

01:14:08.243 --> 01:14:09.778

01:14:20.055 --> 01:14:22.958
IN ANY EVENT IS NO DOUBT THAT

01:14:23.025 --> 01:14:24.526
THE AUTHORITY WILL NEED ADDED

01:14:24.593 --> 01:14:27.262
FUNDING BEYOND EXISTING SOURCES

01:14:27.329 --> 01:14:29.965
IF IT IS TO GO BEYOND THE

MERCED THE BAKERSFIELD SUCTION.

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:33.969
WITH THIS IN MIND A REPORT

01:14:34.036 --> 01:14:36.672
EMPHASIZES SEVERAL POINTS THE

01:14:36.738 --> 01:14:37.172
LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO

01:14:37.239 --> 01:14:40.075
CONSIDER. ASSUMING THE BINDING

01:14:40.142 --> 01:14:41.410
MINISTRATION APPROVES A

01:14:41.476 --> 01:14:43.312
RELAXATION OF THE ERA DEADLINE

01:14:43.378 --> 01:14:45.214
THERE WILL NO LONGER BE ANY

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:48.450
MAJOR TIME PRESSURES THERE IS

01:14:48.517 --> 01:14:50.619
TIME TO THINK. ALTHOUGH THE

01:14:50.686 --> 01:14:52.154
AUTHORITY DOES APPEAR TO BE

01:14:52.221 --> 01:14:53.722
INCREASING ITS CONTROL OVER THE

01:14:53.789 --> 01:14:55.591
CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM THE

01:14:55.657 --> 01:14:57.159
LEGISLATURE COULD BE MORE

01:14:57.226 --> 01:14:58.861
CONFIDENT IN THE COST AND

01:14:58.927 --> 01:15:00.696
SCHEDULE PROJECTIONS IF THAT IS

01:15:00.762 --> 01:15:02.831
DEMONSTRATED OVER A LONGER

01:15:02.898 --> 01:15:05.801
PERIOD OF TIME. GOVERNOR NEWSOM

01:15:05.868 --> 01:15:07.402
HAS DIRECTED THAT A SIGNIFICANT

01:15:07.469 --> 01:15:09.104
PROGRAM TO COMBAT CLIMATE

01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:10.706
CHANGE INCLUDING CHANGES TO THE

01:15:10.772 --> 01:15:12.507
STATE TRANSPORT NETWORK BEING

01:15:12.574 --> 01:15:16.511
DEVELOPED BY JULY THE FIFTEENTH

01:15:16.578 --> 01:15:17.279
TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THIS REPORT

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:18.914
SHOULD CLARIFY THE GOVERNOR'S

01:15:18.981 --> 01:15:20.382
VIEW OF THE ROLE OF HIGH SPEED

01:15:20.449 --> 01:15:22.017
RAIL AND THE OVERALL STATEMENT

01:15:22.084 --> 01:15:25.387
AND HIS IDEAS FOR FINDING IT.

01:15:25.454 --> 01:15:26.655
THIS COULD BE AN IMPORTANT

01:15:26.722 --> 01:15:27.990
BASIS FOR THE LEGISLATURE'S

01:15:28.056 --> 01:15:30.993
CONSIDERATION. THIS CLEARLY

01:15:31.059 --> 01:15:32.728
IMPLIES THAT THERE WILL BE AN

01:15:32.794 --> 01:15:33.729
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE

01:15:33.795 --> 01:15:35.130
LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR

01:15:35.197 --> 01:15:36.798
THAT THE PROJECT WILL GO AHEAD

01:15:36.865 --> 01:15:39.668
EVENTUALLY IF NOT THE PROJECT

01:15:39.735 --> 01:15:41.837
SHOULD BE REASSESSED. THE

01:15:41.904 --> 01:15:43.939
EXISTING EMOJI MEMORANDUM OF

01:15:44.006 --> 01:15:45.440
UNDERSTANDING NEEDS TO BE

01:15:45.507 --> 01:15:47.309
TRANSLATED INTO A DETAILED

01:15:47.376 --> 01:15:48.877
AGREEMENT WITH FOR MANAGEMENT

01:15:48.944 --> 01:15:50.812
AND FUNDING COMMITMENTS FROM

01:15:50.879 --> 01:15:52.481
THE STATE SEN LOOKING FOR

01:15:52.547 --> 01:15:54.983
DOLLARS OR THIRTY AND ACE. THE

01:15:55.050 --> 01:15:56.852
ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF THE

01:15:56.919 --> 01:15:58.720
PROPOSED INTERIM OPERATION IS

01:15:58.787 --> 01:16:00.455
ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON THE

01:16:00.522 --> 01:16:02.391
ACTORS AND FUNDING THEIR

01:16:02.457 --> 01:16:04.526
ELDERLY THE CONTROL OF THE HIGH

01:16:04.593 --> 01:16:06.295
SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. IT'S

01:16:06.361 --> 01:16:09.164
IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT 75%

01:16:09.231 --> 01:16:10.966
OF ALL OF THE WRITERS ON THE

01:16:11.033 --> 01:16:13.302
OVERALL OF THAT ARE PROJECTED

01:16:13.368 --> 01:16:14.836
TO INCREASE AS A RESULT OF THE

01:16:14.903 --> 01:16:16.605
INTEROPERATION ARE ACTUALLY ON

01:16:16.672 --> 01:16:20.375
THE NINE I SPEED SECTION.

01:16:20.442 --> 01:16:22.511
OVERRIDING ALL OF THIS IS THE

01:16:22.577 --> 01:16:24.546
SIMPLE FACT THAT EXISTING

01:16:24.613 --> 01:16:26.882
FUNDING SOURCES MAY WELL NOT BE

01:16:26.949 --> 01:16:28.450
ADEQUATE EVEN TO FINISH THE

01:16:28.517 --> 01:16:30.018
ADDED LINKS IN THE INTERIM

01:16:30.085 --> 01:16:31.720
PROPOSAL. AND THEY WILL

01:16:31.787 --> 01:16:34.122
CERTAINLY NOT PERMIT ADDING

01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:35.991
LINKS OUTSIDE MERCED THE

01:16:36.058 --> 01:16:37.893
BAKERSFIELD. NEW FEDERAL

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:39.695
FUNDING AND RECONSIDERATION OF

01:16:39.761 --> 01:16:42.097
ERA AND THE FISCAL TWENTY TEN

01:16:42.164 --> 01:16:44.199
MONDAY IS A POSSIBILITY THAT

01:16:44.266 --> 01:16:45.968
MAY EMERGE MORE CLEARLY IN THE

01:16:46.034 --> 01:16:48.103
NEXT SIX MONTHS OR SO. AND IT

01:16:48.170 --> 01:16:50.038
IS REASONABLE TO THE FIRST OPEN

01:16:50.105 --> 01:16:52.541
STATE FUNDING DECISIONS UNTIL

01:16:52.607 --> 01:16:54.543
WE KNOW THE ANSWER. BASED ON

01:16:54.609 --> 01:16:56.411
PAST FEDERAL PROGRAM AMOUNTS

01:16:56.478 --> 01:16:58.580
AND STRUCTURE THOUGH. FEDERAL

01:16:58.647 --> 01:17:00.882
MONEY ALONE MAY WILL NOT SOLVE

01:17:00.949 --> 01:17:03.418
THE WHOLE PROBLEM ANYWAY SO ED

01:17:03.485 --> 01:17:05.387
IN STATE FUNDING IN SOME FORM

01:17:05.454 --> 01:17:07.022
IS A CLEAR POSSIBILITY THE

01:17:07.089 --> 01:17:10.692
LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE AWARE OF.

01:17:10.759 --> 01:17:12.327
IN ANY CASE I WANT TO STRESS A

01:17:12.394 --> 01:17:14.429
POINT WE'VE MADE BEFORE THAT

01:17:14.496 --> 01:17:16.164
MANY OF THE PAST MANAGEMENT ON

01:17:16.231 --> 01:17:17.733
THE PROJECTS HAVE BEEN CAUSED

01:17:17.799 --> 01:17:20.335
BY FUNDING ISSUES AND IT WILL

01:17:20.402 --> 01:17:22.437
NEVER BE POSSIBLE IN THE FUTURE

01:17:22.504 --> 01:17:23.572
TO MANAGE THE PROJECT

01:17:23.638 --> 01:17:26.208
EFFECTIVELY WITHOUT ADEQUATE

01:17:26.274 --> 01:17:28.443
AND STABLE FUNDING. WHILE THESE

01:17:28.510 --> 01:17:30.212
ISSUES ARE BEING RESOLVED WE

01:17:30.278 --> 01:17:31.346
BELIEVE THE AUTHORITY SHOULD

01:17:31.413 --> 01:17:33.315
THE FOR MAKING NEW BINDING

01:17:33.382 --> 01:17:34.950
CONTRACT COMMITMENTS OUTSIDE

01:17:35.017 --> 01:17:36.518
DISTRICT OF CENTRAL VALLEY

01:17:36.585 --> 01:17:38.620
REQUIRED WORK. ALTHOUGH WE'VE

01:17:38.687 --> 01:17:39.721
BEEN CHANGING HEARING IN THE

01:17:39.788 --> 01:17:41.323
LINKS AND ON THE MAJOR CIVIL

01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:44.259
WORKS OUTSIDE THE CBS SHOULD OF

01:17:44.326 --> 01:17:46.695
COURSE PROCEED. GIVEN THE

01:17:46.762 --> 01:17:48.096
IMPORTANCE OF THE PROJECT WE

01:17:48.163 --> 01:17:50.499
BELIEVE AS WE HAVE SAID BEFORE

01:17:50.565 --> 01:17:52.467
THAT IMPROVED OVERSIGHT BY THE

01:17:52.534 --> 01:17:53.835
LEGISLATURE WOULD BE A GOOD

01:17:53.902 --> 01:17:56.338
IDEA SINCE THIS IS THE LARGEST

01:17:56.405 --> 01:17:57.539
PROJECT THE STATE HAS EVER

01:17:57.606 --> 01:17:59.541
UNDERTAKEN AND IT IS ONE OF THE

01:17:59.608 --> 01:18:01.410
LARGEST THE NATION HAS EVER

01:18:01.476 --> 01:18:03.879
UNDERTAKEN. THE OVERSIGHT

01:18:03.945 --> 01:18:04.780
FUNCTION SHOULD HAVE ADEQUATE

01:18:04.846 --> 01:18:06.381
STAFFING IT SHOULD HAVE THE

01:18:06.448 --> 01:18:08.350
CONTINUITY NEEDED TO OVERSEE

01:18:08.417 --> 01:18:10.385
THE PROJECT'S. PROGRESS OVER A

01:18:10.452 --> 01:18:13.088
PERIOD OF YEARS NOT JUST ONE

01:18:13.155 --> 01:18:15.457

01:21:55.443 --> 01:21:57.946
THAT'S HELPFUL SO. I IN IT IT

01:21:58.013 --> 01:21:58.947
SAID IN A CONTRACT THAT YOU

01:21:59.014 --> 01:22:00.649
MENTIONED THERE IS A TRACKING

01:22:00.715 --> 01:22:01.716
SYSTEMS CNTRACT THAT'S COMING

01:22:01.783 --> 01:22:02.651
UP WHICH IS A VERY LARGE

01:22:02.717 --> 01:22:04.085
CONTRACT AND WOULD ESSENTIALLY

01:22:04.152 --> 01:22:04.819
COMMIT THE STATE TO

01:22:04.886 --> 01:22:06.588
ELECTRIFICATION. ON AT LEAST

01:22:06.655 --> 01:22:07.989
THAT ONE NINETEEN AT THAT

01:22:08.056 --> 01:22:10.091
INITIAL ONE EIGHTEEN SEGMENT-

01:22:10.158 --> 01:22:11.226
THERE'S ALSO THAT AND

01:22:11.293 --> 01:22:12.360
ROLLINGSTOCK CONTRACT WHICH IS

01:22:12.427 --> 01:22:13.762
ANOTHER VRY LARGE HUNDRED

01:22:13.828 --> 01:22:14.663
THAT'S COMING UP IN ADDITION TO

01:22:14.729 --> 01:22:16.731
THAT. UNDER SOME OTHER ACTIONS

01:22:16.798 --> 01:22:19.000
THAT THE AUTHORITY MAY TAKE ON

01:22:19.067 --> 01:22:21.936
FOR EXAMPLE. YOU MAY START- YOU

01:22:22.003 --> 01:22:22.404
KNOW IT AT SOME POINT

01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:24.005
PURCHASING RIGHT OF WAY THOSE

01:22:24.072 --> 01:22:25.373
TYPES OF ACTIONS WITH WOULD

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:27.475
START- OUTSIDE OF THAT ONE

01:22:27.542 --> 01:22:28.209
NINETEEN RIGHT NOW IT'S BEEN

01:22:28.276 --> 01:22:29.577
BASED BASICALLY FOCUSED ON THAT

01:22:29.644 --> 01:22:30.545
ONE NINETEEN MILES. THOSE TYPES

01:22:30.612 --> 01:22:32.480
OF ACTIONS ALSO START TO KIND

01:22:32.547 --> 01:22:34.215
OF LIMIT THAT THE FLEXIBILITY

01:22:34.282 --> 01:22:35.784
TO TAKE OTHER. APPROACHES IN

01:22:35.850 --> 01:22:38.420
THE FUTURE- IN TERMS OF EITHER

01:22:38.486 --> 01:22:39.587
APPROACH IS I THINK WE TALKED A

01:22:39.654 --> 01:22:40.822
LITTLE BIT. THERE'S BEEN A LOT

01:22:40.889 --> 01:22:41.756
OF REFERENCES TO THAT

01:22:41.823 --> 01:22:43.792
ELECTRIFICATION VERSES NOT. ONE

01:22:43.858 --> 01:22:48.263
OF. THEM I THINK MAYBE FOR THAT

01:22:48.330 --> 01:22:48.930
AND- JUST AS A LITTLE BIT OF. I

01:22:48.997 --> 01:22:50.131
THINK THE MAIN KIND OF. THING

01:22:50.198 --> 01:22:52.334
THAT FOLKS ARE OF ARE. FOCUSED

01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:54.769
ON IS THIS ONE NINETEEN MILES

01:22:54.836 --> 01:22:56.204
AND YOU ELECTRIFY OR NOT IF YOU.

01:22:56.271 --> 01:22:58.573
JOINT IF YOU DON'T ELECTRIFY

01:22:58.640 --> 01:22:59.641
THAT THEY GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT

01:22:59.708 --> 01:23:01.576
MORE FLEXIBILITY BUT THEN OF

01:23:01.643 --> 01:23:02.444
COURSE YOU WANT TO COME BACK

01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:03.578
ELECTRIFY LATER. THAT YEAR

01:23:03.645 --> 01:23:04.679
THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL COST TO

01:23:04.746 --> 01:23:05.814
DOING THAT BUT IF YOU DO

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:08.249
ELECTRIFY THAT PIECE IT

01:23:08.316 --> 01:23:09.818
JUST RUN ON ELECTRIFIED SERVICE

01:23:09.884 --> 01:23:11.619
ON ONE NINETEEN MILES THAT YOU

01:23:11.686 --> 01:23:12.821
FROM SHAFTER TO MADERA AS YOU

01:23:12.887 --> 01:23:14.189
SAW. AND THOSE ARE REALLY

01:23:14.255 --> 01:23:15.223
LOGICAL STARTING AND ENDING

01:23:15.290 --> 01:23:16.858
POINTS AND YOU KNOW YOU

01:23:16.925 --> 01:23:17.826
PROBABLY WOULDN'T WANT TO TAKE

01:23:17.892 --> 01:23:19.327
A CONVENTIONAL TRAINS

01:23:19.394 --> 01:23:21.196
TRANSFERRED TRANSFERRED BACK.

01:23:21.262 --> 01:23:22.564
AND IT PROBABLY ISN'T SERVICE

01:23:22.630 --> 01:23:24.199
THAT REALLY MAKES SENSE SO IF

01:23:24.265 --> 01:23:25.567
YOU'RE GONNA LECTURE BY YOU

01:23:25.633 --> 01:23:26.568
PROBABLY NEED TO ELECTRIFY A

01:23:26.634 --> 01:23:28.303
LARGER SEGMENT AT LEAST MERCED

01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:30.038
TO BAKERSFIELD SO ONCE YOU

01:23:30.105 --> 01:23:30.472
START COMMITTING TO

01:23:30.538 --> 01:23:32.173
ELECTRIFICATION. YOU HAVEN'T

01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:33.508
REALLY PROBABLY JUST COMMITTED

01:23:33.575 --> 01:23:35.276
TO ELECTRIFICATION THAT ONE

01:23:35.343 --> 01:23:36.277
NINETEEN HOW DO YOU PRACTICE

01:23:36.344 --> 01:23:37.445
YOU COULD COMMITTED. TO AT

01:23:37.512 --> 01:23:38.213
LEAST DOING MERCED TO

01:23:38.279 --> 01:23:39.381
BAKERSFIELD OTHERWISE YOU HAVE

01:23:39.447 --> 01:23:40.982
A SEGMENT THAT REALLY JUST

01:23:41.049 --> 01:23:41.716
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THIS ONE

01:23:41.783 --> 01:23:43.151
NINETEEN MILES. SO I DON'T HAVE

01:23:43.218 --> 01:23:44.085
IT RIGHT A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:23:44.152 --> 01:23:45.820
CONTEXT FOR THAT DECISION BUT

01:23:45.887 --> 01:23:46.688
IT REALLY IS A CRITICAL

01:23:46.755 --> 01:23:49.090
DECISION. AND ONCE THOSE YOU

01:23:49.157 --> 01:23:49.591
KNOW THOSE CONTRACTS ARE

01:23:49.657 --> 01:23:51.292
ENTERED INTO. THE STATE COMMITS

01:23:51.359 --> 01:23:53.328
ITSELF TO A TRADITION OF THE

01:23:53.395 --> 01:23:54.529
ONE NINETEEN AND CAN PRACTICE

01:23:54.596 --> 01:23:55.063
WERE PROBABLY COMMITTING

01:23:55.130 --> 01:23:57.432
OURSELVES TO. ELECTRIFICATION

01:23:57.499 --> 01:23:59.000
AND REALLY RUNNING THAT MERCED

01:23:59.067 --> 01:24:00.235
TO BAKERSFIELD THAT MAY REQUIRE

01:24:00.301 --> 01:24:02.036
SOME ADDITIONAL FINES. AND THEN

01:24:02.103 --> 01:24:03.505
IDEALLY IT WOULD PROBABLY BE

01:24:03.571 --> 01:24:04.706
EXPANDED BEYOND THAT BECAUSE

01:24:04.773 --> 01:24:06.241
EVEN MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD.

01:24:06.307 --> 01:24:07.575
IT'S PROBABLY NOT THAT THE

01:24:07.642 --> 01:24:09.010
DREAM OF EVERYONE HERE I THINK

01:24:09.077 --> 01:24:10.612
YOU KNOW THERE'S CERTAINLY

01:24:10.678 --> 01:24:12.280
VISION FOR BEYOND THAT. BUT

01:24:12.347 --> 01:24:14.048
THAT OF COURSE WOULD COME WITH

01:24:14.115 --> 01:24:15.950
ADDITIONAL COSTS. I DON'T KNOW

01:24:16.017 --> 01:24:16.985
MISTER THOMPSON YOU HAVE

01:24:17.051 --> 01:24:18.920
ANYTHING TO ADD AS WELL. IF I

01:24:18.987 --> 01:24:24.959
MAY. I THINK WE SHOULD THAT IS

01:24:25.026 --> 01:24:26.628
ONE WAY. ONE TO WHICH- APPROACH

01:24:26.694 --> 01:24:27.429
THIS. THERE'S ANOTHER ONE WHICH

01:24:27.495 --> 01:24:28.763
IS. LOOK AT IT FROM THE-

01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:31.032
QUESTION OF WHETHER WE'RE

01:24:31.099 --> 01:24:31.599
ACTUALLY GOING TO BUILD THE

01:24:31.666 --> 01:24:34.102
SYSTEM OR NOT. IF THERE IS A

01:24:34.169 --> 01:24:36.838
COMMITMENT TO BUILD THE SYSTEM

01:24:36.905 --> 01:24:37.405
AND THIS IS A STEP ALONG THE

01:24:37.472 --> 01:24:40.975
WAY. THEN THEM IT IT DOESN'T

01:24:41.042 --> 01:24:43.111
MATTER IF WE TAKE OUR TIME AND

01:24:43.178 --> 01:24:45.246
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF WE DO IT A

01:24:45.313 --> 01:24:50.251
LITTLE BIT AT A TIME UNTIL WE

01:24:50.318 --> 01:24:51.920
FACT THERE IS NO COMMITMENT TO

01:24:51.986 --> 01:24:53.822
BUILD THE SYSTEM THEN WE REALLY

01:24:53.888 --> 01:24:56.391
NEED TO THINK ABOUT- WHAT'S

01:24:56.458 --> 01:24:58.159
GONNA HAPPEN NEXT AND HOW FAR

01:24:58.226 --> 01:25:01.796
WE GO. WE ARE COMMITTED- TO

01:25:01.863 --> 01:25:03.465
FAIRNESS BY THAT TO FURNISH THE

01:25:03.531 --> 01:25:04.799
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND OUR

01:25:04.866 --> 01:25:06.968
COMMITMENT THE HUNDRED NINETY

01:25:07.035 --> 01:25:09.604
MILE SECTION THAT WE- IN

01:25:09.671 --> 01:25:10.939
PRINCIPLE WE HAVE TO DO THAT.

01:25:11.005 --> 01:25:13.508
UP BEYOND THAT- ANYTHING

01:25:13.575 --> 01:25:15.076
LEGISLATURE REALLY NEEDS TO

01:25:15.143 --> 01:25:17.178
CONSIDER THE QUESTION OF ARE WE

01:25:17.245 --> 01:25:18.613
GOING TO DO THE SYSTEM

01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:20.748
EVENTUALLY YES OR NO AND IF WE

01:25:20.815 --> 01:25:22.150
ARE AND IF WE CAN AGREE WITH

01:25:22.217 --> 01:25:24.419
YOU THE LEGISLATURE CAN AGREE

01:25:24.486 --> 01:25:24.919
WITH THE GOVERNMENT THEN

01:25:24.986 --> 01:25:27.055
GOVERNOR. THAT'S WHAT'S GOING

01:25:27.121 --> 01:25:30.124
TO HAPPEN. THEN THEN THE TIME

01:25:30.191 --> 01:25:32.393
THAT IS AVAILABLE TO FIGURE OUT

01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:33.862
FIRST WHAT WILL BE THE ROLE OF

01:25:33.928 --> 01:25:34.796
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND

01:25:34.863 --> 01:25:37.098
SECOND YOU KNOW HOW WILL WE SEE

01:25:37.165 --> 01:25:39.167
FOR THIS PROJECT OVER TIME. BUT

01:25:39.234 --> 01:25:41.603
I THINK IT ALL FITS WITHIN THE

01:25:41.669 --> 01:25:43.338
QUESTION OF ARE WE COMMITTED TO

01:25:43.404 --> 01:25:45.373
BUILD THE SYSTEM UNDER PROP ONE

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:47.909
EIGHTY. WE ARE COMMITTED TO

01:25:47.976 --> 01:25:48.943
BUILD THE SYSTEM BUT THE

01:25:49.010 --> 01:25:51.513
LEGISLATURE NEVER HAD A CHANCE

01:25:51.579 --> 01:25:55.583
TO PASS ON THAT. NEITHER DID

01:25:55.650 --> 01:25:56.985
THE GOVERNOR. SO PROP ONE A.

01:25:57.051 --> 01:25:57.685
COULD AS A POSITION TO

01:25:57.752 --> 01:25:59.020
SOMETHING WHICH WAS NOT

01:25:59.087 --> 01:26:00.555
ADEQUATELY FUNDED AND IT DID

01:26:00.622 --> 01:26:03.057
NOT HAVE THE COMMITMENT EITHER

01:26:03.124 --> 01:26:03.525
OF THE GOVERNOR OF THE

01:26:03.591 --> 01:26:05.493
LEGISLATURE. BUT NEEDS TO

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:07.529
CHANGE. IF WE'RE GOING TO PUT

01:26:07.595 --> 01:26:10.498
THE SHORT TERM DECISIONS IN THE

01:26:10.565 --> 01:26:12.967
RIGHT KIND OF CONTACTS. THANK

THOSE THINGS I CERTAINLY AGREE

01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:27.035
THAT THERE IS A LOT OF

01:28:27.101 --> 01:28:28.102
UNCERTAINTY IN TERMS OF THE

01:28:28.169 --> 01:28:29.437
COST ESTIMATES PARTICULARLY

01:28:29.504 --> 01:28:31.806
WITH THOSE MERCED AND

01:28:31.873 --> 01:28:32.740
BAKERSFIELD EXTENSION. BEFORE

01:28:32.807 --> 01:28:35.276
THOSE ARE AN EARLY DESIGNS.

01:28:35.343 --> 01:28:37.245
AGES AND THERE'S A LOT OF

01:28:37.311 --> 01:28:38.212
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW MUCH IS

01:28:38.279 --> 01:28:39.247
GOING TO COST A WHILE BACK OR

01:28:39.313 --> 01:28:40.248
HE'S BECOME MUCH MORE CERTAIN

01:28:40.314 --> 01:28:42.050
ABOUT THAT ONE NINETEEN AND

01:28:42.116 --> 01:28:43.117
EVEN THERE THERE'S YOU KNOW A

01:28:43.184 --> 01:28:44.085
BILLION DOLLARS OF EXTRA

01:28:44.152 --> 01:28:44.886
CONTINGENCY RIGHT BECAUSE

01:28:44.952 --> 01:28:45.920
THERE'S STILL A LOT OF

01:28:45.987 --> 01:28:47.622
UNCERTAINTY EVEN WITH THAT ONE

01:28:47.689 --> 01:28:48.389
NINETEEN BUT CERTAINLY THERE'S

01:28:48.456 --> 01:28:49.290
A HUGE AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY

01:28:49.357 --> 01:28:50.525
WITH THE MERCED AND BAKERSFIELD

01:28:50.591 --> 01:28:52.393
EXTENSION AND- DEFINITELY

01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:53.961
BEYOND THAT SO. YOU KNOW THEY

01:28:54.028 --> 01:28:54.896
HAD THERE IS THAT SORT OF

01:28:54.962 --> 01:28:56.531
ESTIMATE OF THE TOTAL PROJECT

01:28:56.597 --> 01:28:57.665
COSTS THAT YOU EIGHTY PLUS

01:28:57.732 --> 01:29:00.168
BILLION BUT THAT IS SUBJECT TO

01:29:00.234 --> 01:29:01.736
VERY VERY SIGNIFICANT

01:29:01.803 --> 01:29:03.504
UNCERTAINTY BECAUSE THERE'S

01:29:03.571 --> 01:29:04.539
BEEN ONLY REALLY PRELIMINARY

01:29:04.605 --> 01:29:07.675
WORK- FOR A LOT OF PHASE ONE. I

01:29:07.742 --> 01:29:09.277
TELL ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH YOU

01:29:09.343 --> 01:29:11.012
ON THAT CERTAINLY THE TIMING

01:29:11.079 --> 01:29:13.147
THAT THAT DIED TWENTY THIRTY

01:29:13.214 --> 01:29:14.449
THREE DAY BATTLE THAT IT SEEMS

01:29:14.515 --> 01:29:16.718
FULL FUNDING WHICH IS NOT WHICH

01:29:16.784 --> 01:29:18.019
AS WE'VE HEARD AND IN THIS

01:29:18.086 --> 01:29:19.287
PANEL SO FAR AND IN THE

01:29:19.353 --> 01:29:21.322
PREVIOUS PANEL DOESN'T EXIST

01:29:21.389 --> 01:29:22.924
AND SO EVEN IF THEY HAD THAT

01:29:22.990 --> 01:29:24.625
THAT THE FORTIES ESTIMATE IF

01:29:24.692 --> 01:29:25.860
THEY HAVE ALL THE MONEY IN HAND

01:29:25.927 --> 01:29:27.762
TODAY READY TO GO. EVEN THAT

01:29:27.829 --> 01:29:29.230
MIGHT BE AMBITIOUS AND BY

01:29:29.297 --> 01:29:30.598
CERTAINLY WITHOUT YOU KNOW

01:29:30.665 --> 01:29:31.766
WITHOUT FULL FUNDING WHICH IS

01:29:31.833 --> 01:29:32.967
THE REALITY OF THE SITUATION

01:29:33.034 --> 01:29:34.769
NOW AND THAT'S UNLIKELY THAT TO

01:29:34.836 --> 01:29:37.138
COME TO PASS SO I'M DEFINITELY

01:29:37.205 --> 01:29:39.240
AGREE WITH WHAT YOU AND

01:29:39.307 --> 01:29:40.508
INDICATED THEY'RE HAPPY TO WORK

01:29:40.575 --> 01:29:41.809
WITH YOU HAD TO THINK ABOUT

01:29:41.876 --> 01:29:43.911
OPTIONS- IF THAT'S HELPFUL.

01:29:43.978 --> 01:29:45.413
THANK YOU MISS CHRISTINE AND

01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:46.981
YES I THINK WHAT WE'RE ASKING

01:29:47.048 --> 01:29:48.015
FOR IS THE SCENARIO PLAN I KNOW

01:29:48.082 --> 01:29:49.684
THAT SEEMS EASY ENOUGH BUT

01:29:49.751 --> 01:29:50.818
THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT

01:29:50.885 --> 01:29:57.258
POTENTIALS. THAT COULD BE- THE-

01:29:57.325 --> 01:29:57.825
DURING THIS PROCESS THAT WE

01:29:57.892 --> 01:29:58.359
WOULD LIKE TO SEE A THING

01:29:58.426 --> 01:30:01.262
VISUAL. SO THAT OBJECT. AND

01:30:01.329 --> 01:30:03.664
MISTER KELLY WILL HAVE A YEAH

01:30:03.731 --> 01:30:04.799
NO I JUST WANT TO A AS HE

01:30:04.866 --> 01:30:06.768
QUESTIONS I WILL ARE A IN THE

01:30:06.834 --> 01:30:08.970
BUSINESS PLANS TO BOTH YOU KNOW

01:30:09.036 --> 01:30:11.305
LAY OUT WHAT WE HAVE WHAT THE

01:30:11.372 --> 01:30:14.509
VISION IS A BE ON THIS PROGRAM

01:30:14.575 --> 01:30:16.844
TO GET ALTERNATELY TO THE PHASE

01:30:16.911 --> 01:30:17.945
ONE SYSTEM THAT THE VOTERS

01:30:18.012 --> 01:30:19.280
APPROVED AND THAT'S HOW WE

01:30:19.347 --> 01:30:20.715
REPRESENT THE STOP THE BUSINESS

01:30:20.782 --> 01:30:22.483
PLAN IT IS FAIR AND A GOOD

01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:24.252
QUESTION AND A GOOD POINT. FOR

01:30:24.318 --> 01:30:25.653
BOTH L. A. O. AND THE PEER

01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:27.321
REVIEW GROUP SHOULD KNOW THAT

01:30:27.388 --> 01:30:29.624
THERE ARE RISKS I HAD ALONG THE

01:30:29.690 --> 01:30:31.959
WAY ON THIS AND I JUST WANT TO.

01:30:32.026 --> 01:30:34.462
VOLUNTEER MY TEAM AND MY STAFF

01:30:34.529 --> 01:30:36.030
TO TALK ABOUT IT BE PART OF

01:30:36.097 --> 01:30:40.101
THIS DISCUSSION. ON BUT HOW WE

01:30:40.168 --> 01:30:41.769
INCREMENTALLY GO FORWARD IN THE

01:30:41.836 --> 01:30:43.271
TIMING. BECAUSE I THINK THERE

01:30:43.337 --> 01:30:45.439
ARE IMPORTANT THINGS TO PEEL

01:30:45.506 --> 01:30:47.875
APART. IF YOU DON'T DO CERTAIN

01:30:47.942 --> 01:30:49.911
THINGS IT MEANS SOME COSTS ARE

01:30:49.977 --> 01:30:51.612
SIMPLY DEFERRED IF YOU DO

01:30:51.679 --> 01:30:53.815
CERTAIN THINGS. LET'S MAKE SURE

01:30:53.881 --> 01:30:57.118
THAT WE CAN COVER THAT AND-

01:30:57.185 --> 01:30:57.752
HAVE A GREATER LEVEL OF COMFORT

01:30:57.819 --> 01:30:59.754
ON THE ESTIMATES FOR THAT SO

01:30:59.821 --> 01:31:01.889
FOR EXAMPLE I WANT ONE TO. NOT

01:31:01.956 --> 01:31:03.324
MOVE FORWARD ON ADVANCED DESIGN

01:31:03.391 --> 01:31:05.393
WORK THAT WOULD ANSWER A LOT OF

01:31:05.459 --> 01:31:06.027
QUESTIONS ABOUT COST AND OTHER

01:31:06.093 --> 01:31:08.663
THINGS. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT DONE

01:31:08.729 --> 01:31:09.730
WITH THE ONE NINETEEN YEAH WE

01:31:09.797 --> 01:31:11.399
SHOULD DO THOSE CONCURRENTLY.

01:31:11.465 --> 01:31:13.367
SO I THINK THERE ARE I THINK

01:31:13.434 --> 01:31:15.303
WHAT I'M ASKING IS. THAT THE

01:31:15.369 --> 01:31:17.171
AUTHORITY BE A PARTICIPANT WITH

01:31:17.238 --> 01:31:19.707
L. PRG LEGISLATIVE OFFICES

01:31:19.774 --> 01:31:21.976
ABOUT LEADING OUT WITH THOSE

01:31:22.043 --> 01:31:23.277
INCREMENTAL STEPS COULD LOOK

01:31:23.344 --> 01:31:24.512
LIKE AND I WOULD. APPRECIATE

01:31:24.579 --> 01:31:25.913
THAT OPPORTUNITY THAT'S ALL

01:31:25.980 --> 01:31:29.217
THANK YOU MISTER KELLY AND- I'M-

01:31:29.283 --> 01:31:32.053
MADE. I THINK ALREADY HAS IF

01:31:32.119 --> 01:31:33.487
YOU CAN BE BRIEF IN WE HAVE

01:31:33.554 --> 01:31:35.056
ONE- AND WILL ONE THING IS LIVE

01:31:35.122 --> 01:31:37.425
WITH OF IN THE RECOMMENDATION

01:31:37.491 --> 01:31:39.060
THAT WE MADE TO THE LEGISLATURE

01:31:39.126 --> 01:31:41.562
IN WHICH I THINK BRIAN MOSTLY.

01:31:41.629 --> 01:31:44.565
KERR'S THERE. THERE ARE STILL

01:31:44.632 --> 01:31:46.534
MORE UNCERTAINTY IS OF THAT

01:31:46.601 --> 01:31:48.169
WILL BE ADDRESSED IN THE NEXT

01:31:48.236 --> 01:31:49.604
SIX MONTHS OR SO THAT WILL MAKE

01:31:49.670 --> 01:31:51.572
IT. CLEAR WHAT YOU MIGHT WISH

01:31:51.639 --> 01:31:54.041
TO DO. ONE IS THE FEDERAL ROLE

01:31:54.108 --> 01:31:55.877
I HOPE IT WILL BE CLEARER YOU

01:31:55.943 --> 01:31:57.278
WILL HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF WHAT

01:31:57.345 --> 01:31:59.447
KIND OF WORK THEY WILL BE. THE

01:31:59.513 --> 01:32:02.183
SECOND IS BRIAN PROPOSES IS TO

01:32:02.250 --> 01:32:03.985
DO A LOT MORE ENGINEERING WORK

01:32:04.051 --> 01:32:05.786
AND BETTER COST ESTIMATES OF

01:32:05.853 --> 01:32:07.722
THOSE LINKS AND ON THE TUNNEL

01:32:07.788 --> 01:32:09.490
SOLD HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF.

01:32:09.557 --> 01:32:10.958
HOW REALISTIC IT IS THAT THEY

01:32:11.025 --> 01:32:12.059
CAN LOOK UP WHAT THEY CAN

01:32:12.126 --> 01:32:15.863
ACCOMPLISH. WITH NEW EXISTING

01:32:15.930 --> 01:32:16.964
MONEY. OF THE THIRTY. IS

WHICH COMES AND GOES. THE

01:32:21.602 --> 01:32:24.438
STATE'S DECISION. WILL BE MUCH

01:32:24.505 --> 01:32:26.107
CLEARER IN. IS THE LEGISLATURE

BE PROVIDED. IN THE FINAL EIGHT

01:32:32.647 --> 01:32:33.948
POINTS IS THE MEMORANDUM OF

01:32:34.015 --> 01:32:36.083
UNDERSTANDING THE KEY OPERATING

01:32:36.150 --> 01:32:37.551
AGREEMENT FOR THE INTERIM

01:32:37.618 --> 01:32:39.620
SYSTEM WHICH SHALL. IS A

01:32:39.687 --> 01:32:41.555
MEMORANDUM BY A NUMBER OF THOSE

01:32:41.622 --> 01:32:42.823
ISSUES COULD BE MUCH FURTHER

01:32:42.890 --> 01:32:44.892
CLARIFIED SO THE LEGISLATURE

01:32:44.959 --> 01:32:46.694
WOULD HAVE. MORE CONFIDENCE IN

01:32:46.761 --> 01:32:50.965
WHAT IS OPTIONS. REALLY ARE AND

01:32:51.032 --> 01:32:51.632

TO OUR LAST QUESTION FOR THIS

01:32:55.403 --> 01:32:57.071
PANEL SENATOR MCCARTHY. GARCIA

01:32:57.138 --> 01:32:58.472
I GUESS THE KEY QUESTION FOR

01:32:58.539 --> 01:33:01.108
THE DECISION MAKERS HERE IS

01:33:01.175 --> 01:33:02.877
WHAT WE DO WITH THE REQUEST FOR

01:33:02.944 --> 01:33:05.646
FULL FUNDING ON THE ONE A- AND

01:33:05.713 --> 01:33:07.882
I. REALLY SAYS IT FOR ALL IN

OBVIOUSLY APPROVAL ALL THE

01:33:11.519 --> 01:33:14.956
FUNDING AND KEEP YOUR EYE ON

01:33:15.022 --> 01:33:17.224
THE BALL- I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE

01:33:17.291 --> 01:33:18.559
AND IF THE LEGISLATURE IS

01:33:18.626 --> 01:33:19.994
WILLING TO ACCEPT THAT RISK

01:33:20.061 --> 01:33:21.762
AND- ACCEPT THE OPPORTUNITY.

01:33:21.829 --> 01:33:23.397
THE INVITATION THAT THEY MAY

01:33:23.464 --> 01:33:24.565
HAVE TO COME UP WITH MORE

01:33:24.632 --> 01:33:26.701
FUNDING. IN ADDITION TO ALL THE

01:33:26.767 --> 01:33:28.035
OTHER FUNDING SOURCES WE'VE

01:33:28.102 --> 01:33:30.304
TALKED TO- I GUESS MY QUESTION

01:33:30.371 --> 01:33:34.508
IS THAT. IS THERE A NUMBER THAT

01:33:34.575 --> 01:33:36.210
PEOPLE ARE THINKING ABOUT AS WE

01:33:36.277 --> 01:33:38.379
WAIT FOR OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS

01:33:38.446 --> 01:33:39.480
TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY'RE GOING

01:33:39.547 --> 01:33:43.050
TO BE AMBITIOUS OR AS IS THE

01:33:43.117 --> 01:33:45.686
MISTER KELLY'S AT STATED

01:33:45.753 --> 01:33:47.221
THERE'S SOME ENVIRONMENTAL WORK

01:33:47.288 --> 01:33:49.423
AND SOME OTHER NON CONSTRUCTION

01:33:49.490 --> 01:33:51.125
WORK THAT IS VERY VALUABLE FOR

01:33:51.192 --> 01:33:54.795
US TO DETERMINE COSTS SO- I GET

01:33:54.862 --> 01:33:56.931
THE EASY ANSWER FOR ALL LAND

01:33:56.998 --> 01:33:58.299
FUNDED ALL I GUESS THE QUESTION

01:33:58.366 --> 01:34:01.369
IS THAT SHE'D AGREE FOR THE LA-

01:34:01.435 --> 01:34:02.837
IF THEY CAN. HELP US WITH. WE

01:34:02.903 --> 01:34:04.038
DON'T WANT TO RUIN THE

01:34:04.105 --> 01:34:06.107
STABILITY OF EXPECTATIONS WE

01:34:06.173 --> 01:34:07.875
DON'T WANT TO RUIN THE-

01:34:07.942 --> 01:34:09.210
RELATIONSHIP A POTENTIAL

01:34:09.276 --> 01:34:10.444
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FEDERAL

01:34:10.511 --> 01:34:12.079
GOVERNMENT BUT HOW DO WE- HOW

01:34:12.146 --> 01:34:13.180
DO WE DISCUSS THIS AMONG

01:34:13.247 --> 01:34:15.016
OURSELVES AND IF WE PLAY WITH

01:34:15.082 --> 01:34:17.818
THE NUMBERS. I THINK PERHAPS

01:34:17.885 --> 01:34:19.553
ONE THING TO CONSIDER IS THAT

01:34:19.620 --> 01:34:20.921
THE THIRTY NOT GONNA NEED THAT

01:34:20.988 --> 01:34:23.257
THE ENTIRE FOUR POINT ONE

01:34:23.324 --> 01:34:25.993
BILLION IN. THAT YEAR- AND I

01:34:26.060 --> 01:34:27.361
THINK IN FACT THERE'S SOME

01:34:27.428 --> 01:34:28.396
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT EXACTLY HOW

01:34:28.462 --> 01:34:30.064
MUCH OF THAT THEY WILL NEED-

01:34:30.131 --> 01:34:32.366
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THEIR THEIR-

01:34:32.433 --> 01:34:34.802
PAST HISTORY OF NOT REALLY

01:34:34.869 --> 01:34:37.738
SPENDING UP THERE PROJECTED.

01:34:37.805 --> 01:34:39.807
LEVELS AND SO. FOR EXAMPLE THE

01:34:39.874 --> 01:34:42.309
LEGISLATURE COULD APPROVE YOU

01:34:42.376 --> 01:34:44.278
KNOW PORTION OF THAT WHATEVER-

01:34:44.345 --> 01:34:46.013
IS A TERM HE BEING NEEDED YOU

01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:48.249
KNOW IF ANY TO SORT OF GET THE

01:34:48.315 --> 01:34:48.849
AUTHORITY THROUGH THE FISCAL

01:34:48.916 --> 01:34:52.353
YEAR. AND THEN. COULD HOLD OFF

01:34:52.420 --> 01:34:53.854
ON THE DECISION ABOUT THE

01:34:53.921 --> 01:34:55.289
REMAINING FRIENDS THAT WERE AT

01:34:55.356 --> 01:34:56.891
YOU KNOW AS WE SAID WE PROVIDE

01:34:56.957 --> 01:34:58.592
ANOTHER NATURAL OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:34:58.659 --> 01:34:59.660
LEGISLATURE COME BACK NEXT

01:34:59.727 --> 01:35:01.662
YEAR- I THINK ONE THING TO DO

01:35:01.729 --> 01:35:03.330
YOU TO CONSIDER THEIR TO YOU

01:35:03.397 --> 01:35:04.532
THOUGH IS WHETHER IT'S- THE

01:35:04.598 --> 01:35:05.499
LEGISLATURE WANT TO PROVIDE

01:35:05.566 --> 01:35:06.300
DIRECTION TO THE AUTHORITIES

01:35:06.367 --> 01:35:08.035
SPECIFICALLY NOT. GOING TO

01:35:08.102 --> 01:35:08.903
ENTER INTO ANY THIS CONTRACT

01:35:08.969 --> 01:35:11.305
THAT WOULD BIND THE LEGISLATURE

01:35:11.372 --> 01:35:12.706
I'M REALLY TO A SPECIFIC

01:35:12.773 --> 01:35:14.842
APPROACH BECAUSE ESPECIALLY

01:35:14.909 --> 01:35:16.310
LIKE WE KNOW THAT THEIR

01:35:16.377 --> 01:35:16.911
TRACKING SYSTEMS CONTRACT IS

01:35:16.977 --> 01:35:18.679
COMING UP. THE ROLLING STOCK

01:35:18.746 --> 01:35:20.481
PROCUREMENT IS COMING UP IF

01:35:20.548 --> 01:35:21.449
THEY PROCEED WITH THOSE

01:35:21.515 --> 01:35:24.085
COMMITMENTS SPAN AND THEN

01:35:24.151 --> 01:35:25.086
REALISTICALLY PROBABLY THE

01:35:25.152 --> 01:35:26.954
PROJECT ASSISTANT ON OF HAVE TO

01:35:27.021 --> 01:35:28.289
GO IN ONE DIRECTION WHICH IS

01:35:28.355 --> 01:35:32.493
NOW. AFTER FIVE YEARS AT THE

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:34.228
BAKERSFIELD. SO I THINK KNOW

01:35:34.295 --> 01:35:35.629
WOULD HAVE TO DO ALL ALL OR

01:35:35.696 --> 01:35:38.499
NOTHING THE FOR FREE YOU COULD.

01:35:38.566 --> 01:35:40.801
YEP CERTAIN. AND YOU COULD YOU

01:35:40.868 --> 01:35:42.937
COULD DESIGNATE THOSE FUNDS TO

01:35:43.003 --> 01:35:44.472
YOU COULD HAVE OR YOU COULD SAY

01:35:44.538 --> 01:35:45.306
YOU KNOW WE WANT TO PORTION OF

01:35:45.372 --> 01:35:46.073
THEM TO GO TO CERTAIN

01:35:46.140 --> 01:35:48.042
ACTIVITIES IF YOU. REALLY VALUE

01:35:48.109 --> 01:35:50.211
THAT ADVANCED DESIGN WORK YOU

01:35:50.277 --> 01:35:51.679
COULD. YOU COULD TRY TO MAKE

01:35:51.745 --> 01:35:53.581
SURE THAT WAS PRIORITIZE IN IN

01:35:53.647 --> 01:35:55.883
WHATEVER YOU FIND. SO YEAH I

01:35:55.950 --> 01:35:56.851
THINK THERE'S PROBABLY SOME

01:35:56.917 --> 01:35:57.685
OPTIONS DEPENDING ON THE

01:35:57.751 --> 01:35:59.220
PRIORITIES OF THE LEGISLATURE

01:35:59.286 --> 01:36:00.054
IN ITS COMFORT LEVEL AGAIN

01:36:00.121 --> 01:36:02.123
WITH. WITH WHETHER IT WANTS TO

01:36:02.189 --> 01:36:03.023
COMMIT TO OUR CENTURY HERSELF

01:36:03.090 --> 01:36:05.226
AND REALLY ALL OF PHASE ONE- OR

01:36:05.292 --> 01:36:07.194
AT LEAST OUT OF THE VALLEY AND

01:36:07.261 --> 01:36:08.095
COULD EVEN MERCED TO BAKER

01:36:08.162 --> 01:36:09.063
STILL THIS PROBLEM ESPECIALLY

01:36:09.130 --> 01:36:10.264
AS CURRENTLY ENVISIONED A

01:36:10.331 --> 01:36:11.699
SINGLE TRACK OR SAID TO

01:36:11.765 --> 01:36:12.666
BAKERSFIELD WITH VERY BASIC

01:36:12.733 --> 01:36:14.468
STATIONS. IT IS IT'S PROBABLY

01:36:14.535 --> 01:36:16.604
NOT FOLKS IS A SORT OF END GAME

01:36:16.670 --> 01:36:17.872
HERE AND I DON'T THINK IT'S

01:36:17.938 --> 01:36:19.173
EVEN YOU KNOW THE AUTHORITIES

01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:19.940
ENGAGEMENTS AS THEY'VE

01:36:20.007 --> 01:36:22.009
INDICATED THEY THINK VIEW THIS

01:36:22.076 --> 01:36:27.681
AS A STEPPING. BLOCK APPROACH-

01:36:27.748 --> 01:36:28.315
WE MAY BARELY GET ENOUGH TO DO

01:36:28.382 --> 01:36:29.750
THAT. POTENTIALLY BUT EVEN THAT

01:36:29.817 --> 01:36:31.886
WOULDN'T. BE WHAT WOULD REALLY

01:36:31.952 --> 01:36:33.120
WANT RESET THE BAKERSFIELD AND

01:36:33.187 --> 01:36:33.954
CERTAINLY NOT FOR THE ENTIRE

01:36:34.021 --> 01:36:37.057
SYSTEM SO. I THINK IT'S OUR

01:36:37.124 --> 01:36:37.691
TIMES WITH ACTUALLY CRACKED. WE

01:36:37.758 --> 01:36:38.659
NEE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IS

01:36:38.726 --> 01:36:42.496
THAT COMMITMENT- AND IF TO THE

01:36:42.563 --> 01:36:43.764
EXTENT THAT WE CAN DELAY THAT

01:36:43.831 --> 01:36:44.632
DECISION TO GET MORE

01:36:44.698 --> 01:36:46.333
INFORMATION THAT'S WONDERFUL.

01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:47.434
AND I THINK THAT WE PROBABLY

01:36:47.501 --> 01:36:49.670
CAN'T BE A LOT MORE FLEXIBILITY

01:36:49.737 --> 01:36:51.605
NOW DESPITE NAY MINISTRATION.

01:36:51.672 --> 01:36:53.641
YOU HAVE TO TAKE SOME MORE TIME

01:36:53.707 --> 01:36:55.609
TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS- AND-

01:36:55.676 --> 01:36:56.343
PRESERVE SOME OF THAT

01:36:56.410 --> 01:36:59.013
FLEXIBILITY SO I THINK THAT WAS

01:36:59.079 --> 01:37:00.047
ALSO AN EXCELLENT POINT. THANK

01:37:00.114 --> 01:37:01.882

STOCKTON DOWNTOWN INTERSECTIONS

01:40:04.098 --> 01:40:05.866
AND INTERSECTS WITH THAT THE

01:40:05.933 --> 01:40:08.302
MAJOR TWO MAJOR HIGHWAYS SO.

01:40:08.369 --> 01:40:09.737
THIS PROJECT FOR US IS VERY

01:40:09.803 --> 01:40:11.672
EXCITING WE GOT A FEDERAL BILL

GRANT RECENTLY ONE OF THE ONLY

01:40:13.507 --> 01:40:15.609
RAIL GRANTS LIKE THAT IN THE

01:40:15.676 --> 01:40:17.778
COUNTRY. AND THEN IT IT BOOSTED

01:40:17.845 --> 01:40:19.012
AN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED MILLION

01:40:19.079 --> 01:40:20.748
DOLLARS IN STATE FUNDING SO

01:40:20.814 --> 01:40:22.282

01:40:27.454 --> 01:40:34.094
STATEWIDE. I HE LIVES. HM SAN

01:40:34.161 --> 01:40:35.796
JOAQUIN SPOKE OPERATES ON THE

01:40:35.863 --> 01:40:37.998
FREIGHT LINES THE CORPORATION

01:40:38.065 --> 01:40:40.033
OF BURLINGTON NORTHERN SANTA FE

01:40:40.100 --> 01:40:42.169
AND UNION PACIFIC ARE CRITICAL

01:40:42.236 --> 01:40:44.271
AND OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES

01:40:44.338 --> 01:40:46.073
WE DEVELOP GOOD RELATIONSHIPS

01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:48.041
WITH THEM SO THAT NOW WE'RE AT

01:40:48.108 --> 01:40:49.443
A POINT WHERE WE'RE GETTING

01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:51.145

01:41:44.465 --> 01:41:49.036
TWO AND I'LL TALK. ABOUT ARE

01:41:49.102 --> 01:41:49.670
GOING TO GO SIMULTANEOUSLY. BUT

01:41:49.736 --> 01:41:50.471
THIS ROUTE IS FOR FROM SAP.

01:41:50.537 --> 01:41:53.240
DOWN TO STOCKTON. THE PURPLE

01:41:53.307 --> 01:41:54.842
AND GREEN LINE THAT YOU SEE

01:41:54.908 --> 01:41:57.010
WITH THE OTHERS KIND OF MAGENTA

01:41:57.077 --> 01:41:58.545
AND GREEN THAT IS GOING TO BE

01:41:58.612 --> 01:42:00.314
THE NEW. RAIL ROUTE OF THE

01:42:00.380 --> 01:42:02.416
FUTURE THIS IS A ROUTE THAT'LL

01:42:02.483 --> 01:42:04.084
ALLOW US TO ADD MANY MORE TRAIN

01:42:04.151 --> 01:42:06.153
FREQUENCIES. THIS IS A UNION

01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:07.955
PACIFIC SEGMENT THEY'VE OFFERED

01:42:08.021 --> 01:42:09.289
THAT WE COULD NEGOTIATE WITH

01:42:09.356 --> 01:42:10.858
THEM TO GO UP TO A HUNDRED AND

01:42:10.924 --> 01:42:12.960
TEN. MILES AN HOUR BUT GIVEN

01:42:13.026 --> 01:42:15.662
THE SPACING PROBABLY NINETY TO

01:42:15.729 --> 01:42:16.830
NINETY FIVE IS MORE LIKELY BUT

01:42:16.897 --> 01:42:17.898
THAT'S FASTER THAN WE RUN

01:42:17.965 --> 01:42:20.767
TODAY. AND THEN THESE- THIS

01:42:20.834 --> 01:42:22.769
ALIGNMENT GIVES US. BETTER

01:42:22.836 --> 01:42:24.104
SERVICE TO THE SACRAMENTO

01:42:24.171 --> 01:42:26.206
AIRPORT WHICH WOULD NOT HAVE ON

01:42:26.273 --> 01:42:27.508
THE FORMER LINE AND IT ALSO

01:42:27.574 --> 01:42:29.676
ALLOWS US TO WORK WITH YOU

01:42:29.743 --> 01:42:31.912
COUNTY FOR POTENTIAL EXPANSIONS

01:42:31.979 --> 01:42:33.947
UP TO. A YUBA CITY AND MERRY'S

01:42:34.014 --> 01:42:35.215
VEIL WHICH THE CURRENT LINE

01:42:35.282 --> 01:42:37.184
DOES NOT DO SO FROM A FUTURE

01:42:37.251 --> 01:42:39.686
STANDPOINT. THIS RAIL LINE WELL

01:42:39.753 --> 01:42:41.288
LET'S NOT USE NOW WILL OPEN UP

01:42:41.355 --> 01:42:43.457
SERVICE T A LOT MORE PARTS OF

01:42:43.524 --> 01:42:45.626
THE STATE. AND MORE CONNECTIONS

01:42:45.692 --> 01:42:48.629
TO BE MADE. OUR WAY TO THE

01:42:48.695 --> 01:42:49.930
STATE IN YELLOW YOU SEE THE

01:42:49.997 --> 01:42:53.767
ACE. EXISTING SERVICE. AT THE

01:42:53.834 --> 01:42:55.335
LATER OF AREA WE BRANCH OFTEN

01:42:55.402 --> 01:42:57.437
GO SOUTH SO OUR WAVE ONE OF

01:42:57.504 --> 01:42:58.805
CONSTRUCTION IS THE DOTTED

01:42:58.872 --> 01:43:00.307
GREEN LINE THAT TAKES US DOWN

01:43:00.374 --> 01:43:03.043
TO SERIES. THAT'S ABOUT TWENTY

01:43:03.110 --> 01:43:04.912
FIVE MILE EXTENSION. AND THEN

01:43:04.978 --> 01:43:07.114
OUR OUR WAGE THREE IS THE

01:43:07.180 --> 01:43:09.550
PURPLE SECTION FROM SERIES DOWN

01:43:09.616 --> 01:43:10.951
THE MERCED YOU CAN SEE THAT

01:43:11.018 --> 01:43:12.553
THAT'S LONGER IT'S GOT RIVER

01:43:12.619 --> 01:43:15.489
CROSSINGS- SO THAT IS GOING TO

01:43:15.556 --> 01:43:16.189
BE A LITTLE BIT OF A BIGGER

01:43:16.256 --> 01:43:18.759
LEFT. BUT IT GETS US TO OUR

01:43:18.825 --> 01:43:21.028
INITIAL SERVICE TO MERCED. AND

01:43:21.094 --> 01:43:24.932
THE PRIMARY STATIONS. OUR PHASE

01:43:24.998 --> 01:43:27.301
FOR WHICH WILL BE AFTER TWENTY

01:43:27.367 --> 01:43:29.736
TWENTY SIX. WILL BUILD IN ALL

01:43:29.803 --> 01:43:31.204
OF THE PLANNED STATIONS WHICH

01:43:31.271 --> 01:43:34.007
IS FOURTEEN. AND THE

01:43:34.074 --> 01:43:36.343
INFRASTRUCTURE TO HAVE SIX

01:43:36.410 --> 01:43:38.011
TRAINS DOWN SOMERSET. YOU SEE

01:43:38.078 --> 01:43:40.147
THE LITTLE INTERSECTION DOWN

01:43:40.213 --> 01:43:41.448
THE BOTTOM OF THE SLIDE MERCED

01:43:41.515 --> 01:43:44.217
LOOKS VERY SIMPLE- BUT OF

01:43:44.284 --> 01:43:49.790
COURSE IT ISN'T AS YOU HEARD.

01:43:49.856 --> 01:43:50.891
EARLIER A LOT OF COMPLICATIONS

01:43:50.958 --> 01:43:52.159
WHEN YOU BUILD REYES. WHEN- THE

01:43:52.225 --> 01:43:54.962
B. WHICH IS OUR SAME MUCH RUN.

01:43:55.028 --> 01:43:55.896
AND THE U. P. WHICH IS OUR ACE

01:43:55.963 --> 01:43:57.598
RUN WHEN THOSE TWO LINE COME

01:43:57.664 --> 01:44:00.200
DOWN TOMORROW. THEY ARE NOT AT

01:44:00.267 --> 01:44:01.702
THE SAME LOCATION SO YOU SEE ON

01:44:01.768 --> 01:44:02.936
THE SITE HERE IT'S CALLED OUT

01:44:03.003 --> 01:44:04.404
WHERE THE MERCED STATION WILL

01:44:04.471 --> 01:44:06.340
BE FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL ON THE

01:44:06.406 --> 01:44:08.575
U. P. LINE. THERE IS A GAP FROM

01:44:08.642 --> 01:44:11.979
THE BNSF. WHERE WE NEED TO

01:44:12.045 --> 01:44:13.080
CLOSE THE GAP FOR THE SAN

01:44:13.146 --> 01:44:15.115
JOAQUIN SENATE'S ABOUT FOUR

01:44:15.182 --> 01:44:16.450
THOUSAND FEET SO THIS IS THIS

01:44:16.516 --> 01:44:17.718
IS ONE OF OUR BIG LAUGHS RIGHT

01:44:17.784 --> 01:44:19.386
HERE. HOW TO FIGURE OUT MAKING

01:44:19.453 --> 01:44:21.521
THIS CONNECTION THAT'S A LITTLE

01:44:21.588 --> 01:44:23.957
TOO SOON TO GIVE A FINAL COST

01:44:24.024 --> 01:44:25.292
ESTIMATE AND FIGURE OUT YOU

01:44:25.359 --> 01:44:27.160
KNOW HOW HOW WELL FUNDED WE ARE

01:44:27.227 --> 01:44:29.630
AND WHAT OUR GAP IS. BECAUSE WE

01:44:29.696 --> 01:44:32.499
NEED TO KNOW IF HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:44:32.566 --> 01:44:34.001
WILL COME IN A GRADE. ELEVATED

01:44:34.067 --> 01:44:36.169
IN A TRANSIENT SO AS- AS BRIAN

01:44:36.236 --> 01:44:37.871
WAS TALKING ABOUT DOING THIS

01:44:37.938 --> 01:44:38.739
ADDITIONAL WORK TO GET TO THE

01:44:38.805 --> 01:44:41.108
END POINTS. THAT HELPS US A LOT

01:44:41.174 --> 01:44:43.443
FIGURE OUT WHAT OUR FINAL PHASE

01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:44.978
OF THE PROJECT WILL BE. TO MAKE

01:44:45.045 --> 01:44:46.680
THIS REALLY IMPORTANT

01:44:46.747 --> 01:44:50.617
CONNECTION. SO BACK JUST IN

01:44:50.684 --> 01:44:55.255
SUMMARY WE HAVE- A ONE POINT

01:44:55.322 --> 01:44:56.323
THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN HAND

01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:58.925
TO DATE. AND WE ESTIMATE WE

01:44:58.992 --> 01:45:00.460
NEED ABOUT ONE POINT EIGHT BUT

01:45:00.527 --> 01:45:01.495
LIKE I SAID WE'RE WE'RE STILL

01:45:01.561 --> 01:45:03.163
WORKING WITH THAT NUMBER SO

01:45:03.230 --> 01:45:04.164
THAT IS A LOT TO JUST GET

01:45:04.231 --> 01:45:05.966
ROLLING WITH. WE DO HAVE SIX

01:45:06.033 --> 01:45:07.934
NEW LOCOMOTIVES AND TWENTY ONE

01:45:08.001 --> 01:45:09.636
RAIL CARS ON ORDER SO WE'RE

01:45:09.703 --> 01:45:13.173
READY FOR THAT EXPANSIONIN

01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:13.774
TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THE STOCK

01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:15.542
INDICTMENT WHICH REALLY IS THAT

01:45:15.609 --> 01:45:17.477
I LOVE THIS PROJECT I LIKE TO

01:45:17.544 --> 01:45:18.478
BUILD THINGS AND SO THIS ONE'S

01:45:18.545 --> 01:45:19.980
GOING TO BE TERRIFIC. THE NEED

01:45:20.047 --> 01:45:21.948
WILL BE CONCLUDED THIS FALL IN

01:45:22.015 --> 01:45:22.883
THE FINAL ENGINEERING WILL

01:45:22.949 --> 01:45:25.519
START. EARLY NEXT YEAR AND THEN

01:45:25.585 --> 01:45:27.888
OUR CONSTRUCTION WAVES ONE AND

01:45:27.954 --> 01:45:30.257
TWO WILL BE BEGINNING AND-

01:45:30.323 --> 01:45:32.726
EARLY TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO. THE

01:45:32.793 --> 01:45:34.928
LADY THAT LIKES TO BUILD STUFF

01:45:34.995 --> 01:45:35.595
A LOT OF THINGS WILL BE IN

01:45:35.662 --> 01:45:37.864
ACTION. A LITTLE LESS THAN A

01:45:37.931 --> 01:45:39.399
YEAR FROM NOW SO WE'RE EXCITED

SPEED RAIL WE ARE NOW IN A NEW

01:47:33.980 --> 01:47:35.749
ERA. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF OUR

RAIL- WHEN IT COMES OUR WAY.

01:47:58.939 --> 01:48:00.173
BUT THIS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN

01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:02.542
POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE INVESTMENT

01:48:02.609 --> 01:48:04.511

INVESTMENT FOR THIS GENERATION

01:48:35.275 --> 01:48:36.977
IT WILL PROVIDE A CLEAR

SHE FEELS SOMEBODY ELSE IS

02:00:12.004 --> 02:00:14.173

02:00:21.447 --> 02:00:22.648
WHAT THE TIMING IS I UNDERSTAND

02:00:22.715 --> 02:00:24.050
THAT- CERTAINLY THERE BEEN

02:00:24.116 --> 02:00:25.184
RUMBLINGS ABOUT A POTENTIAL

02:00:25.251 --> 02:00:26.452
INFRASTRUCTURE FELL ON THAT THE

02:00:26.519 --> 02:00:28.688
FEDERAL LEVEL AND WE NEED TO

02:00:28.754 --> 02:00:29.689

THAT IN THE COMING MONTHS. I'M

02:00:31.390 --> 02:00:34.360
CERTAINLY MY UNDERSTANDING IS

02:00:34.427 --> 02:00:35.294
THAT THAT WOULD BE- PERHAPS BE

02:00:35.361 --> 02:00:38.197
BEFORE NEXT YEAR- BEFORE HERE

02:00:38.264 --> 02:00:39.498
NEXT YEAR BUT EXACTLY WHAT THE

02:00:39.565 --> 02:00:41.434
TIMING WOULD BE- I'M NOT

02:00:41.500 --> 02:00:42.935
CERTAIN AND MAYBE THAT AT THAT

02:00:43.002 --> 02:00:44.503
MISTER THOMPSON OR THE THIRTY

02:00:44.570 --> 02:00:45.738
WOULD HAVE SOME MORE SPECIFICS

02:00:45.805 --> 02:00:47.840
ON THAT BUT- MY UNDERSTANDING

02:00:47.907 --> 02:00:50.776
IS CERTAINLY IF WE- COME BACK

02:00:50.843 --> 02:00:55.181

02:01:00.019 --> 02:01:02.288
THOUGHTS MISTER THOMPSON. NO I

pTHE TIMING MIGHT BE I WOULD

02:01:06.692 --> 02:01:08.794
CERTAINLY EXPECT THAT THE

02:01:08.861 --> 02:01:09.996
ATTENTION WILL TURN TO THIS

02:01:10.062 --> 02:01:11.664
KIND OF THING AFTER THE

02:01:11.731 --> 02:01:14.400
COMPLETE RELEASE BILL IS SO.

02:01:14.467 --> 02:01:16.902
ABSORBED AND AFTER THE

02:01:16.969 --> 02:01:18.137
STRUCTURE OF THE CONGRESS I'M

02:01:18.204 --> 02:01:19.138
SURE THEY'RE GOING TO BE

02:01:19.205 --> 02:01:20.906
PASSING A FEW OTHER THINGS AND

02:01:20.973 --> 02:01:22.842
THEN THEY MIGHT TURN TO THIS. I

02:01:22.908 --> 02:01:24.677
DO WANT TO ADD THAT MOST

02:01:24.744 --> 02:01:27.613
FEDERAL PROGRAMS OF THIS KIND.

02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:29.849
REQUIRES STATE JUNIOR OF ONE

02:01:29.915 --> 02:01:32.284
KIND OR THE OTHER SO WE SHOULD

02:01:32.351 --> 02:01:34.487
BE AWARE OF THE FACT THAT THAT

02:01:34.553 --> 02:01:35.855
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS

02:01:35.921 --> 02:01:38.491
ALMOST CERTAIN REALLY NOT GOING

02:01:38.557 --> 02:01:40.593
TO RECORD GOD TO RESCUE US INTO

02:01:40.660 --> 02:01:42.828
A TELLER DAY. BUT IT CERTAINLY

02:01:42.895 --> 02:01:44.964
COULD BE VERY HELPFUL. BUT IF

02:01:45.031 --> 02:01:46.465
THERE IS A STATE SHARE WE

02:01:46.532 --> 02:01:48.834
SHOULD BE PREPARED TO DISCUSS

02:01:48.901 --> 02:01:50.369
HOW WE MIGHT PROVIDE IT ONE

02:01:50.436 --> 02:01:53.572
OPTION. IS THE CAP AND TRADE

02:01:53.639 --> 02:01:58.611
WHICH MIGHT SUFFICE IF. THE

02:01:58.678 --> 02:01:59.612
STATE SHARE IS SMALL ENOUGH. BY

02:01:59.679 --> 02:02:01.013
THE HELL WILL I THINK. BY

02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:01.580
SUMMER WE SHOULD HAVE MUCH

02:02:01.647 --> 02:02:04.884
BETTER IDEA OF THE ROLE THAT

02:02:04.950 --> 02:02:06.152
THE BY THE ADMINISTRATION CAN

02:02:06.218 --> 02:02:08.087
PLAGUE THE CITY TO CONGRESS TO

02:02:08.154 --> 02:02:10.723
GETTING ANYTHING DONE. AND

02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:11.791
CERTAIN WILL HAVE A BETTER

02:02:11.857 --> 02:02:13.392
SENSE OF WHAT THE PRIORITIES

02:02:13.459 --> 02:02:16.495
ARE FOR INFRASTRUCTURE IS CLOSE

02:02:16.562 --> 02:02:18.931
TO THE OTHER PROBLEMS THEY FACE.

02:02:18.998 --> 02:02:20.032
THE MANAGER IF I COULD JUST ASK

02:02:20.099 --> 02:02:21.434
IF IT'S NOT IT BUT

02:02:21.500 --> 02:02:22.735
INAPPROPRIATE I DON'T THINK IT

02:02:22.802 --> 02:02:25.104
IS BUT IT WOULD. I WOULD I

02:02:25.171 --> 02:02:27.606
WOULD DEFER TO. SENATOR ALSO IS

02:02:27.673 --> 02:02:29.141
CHAIR OF SUBCOMMITTEE FIVE

02:02:29.208 --> 02:02:34.080
WHICH TAKES UP TRANSPORTATION.

02:02:34.146 --> 02:02:35.014
MEETING WHICH I UNDERSTAND IS

02:02:35.081 --> 02:02:37.983
ANNUAL- IT WAS SO WE DON'T HAVE

02:02:38.050 --> 02:02:40.720
TO WAIT UP FOR YOU A YEAR- THAT

02:02:40.786 --> 02:02:42.488
ARE CHAIR CONSIDER A

02:02:42.555 --> 02:02:44.223
SUBCOMMITTEE FIVE SURE CONSIDER

02:02:44.290 --> 02:02:46.625
ASKING. THE STATE'S FEDERAL

02:02:46.692 --> 02:02:48.694
LOBBYISTS TO COME IN INTO TO

02:02:48.761 --> 02:02:50.062
TRY TO DO A BETTER JOB OF

02:02:50.129 --> 02:02:52.765
PINPOINTING- THE TIME FOR A PIN

02:02:52.832 --> 02:02:54.300
POINT IS PROBABLY THE WRONG

02:02:54.366 --> 02:02:57.303
WORD PUT ESTABLISHING- THE TIME

02:02:57.369 --> 02:03:01.674

EXPECTED DECISIONS OR EFFORTS

02:03:04.210 --> 02:03:08.147
MIGHT BE MADE. OF BECAUSE I DO

02:03:08.214 --> 02:03:08.714
I DO THINK IT. IT COULD BE

02:03:08.781 --> 02:03:12.952
CRITICAL IN. IT INFORMING US AS

02:03:13.018 --> 02:03:15.254
TO WHEN WE MIGHT WANT TO TAKE

02:03:15.321 --> 02:03:18.290

02:03:22.628 --> 02:03:23.763

02:08:21.660 --> 02:08:23.862
