AROUND RIGHT WE ARE READY TO GO A CENTER RUBIO YOU MAY PERCEIVE ALREADY. HANK YOU. WELL MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO COME IN SPEAKER TODAY I WANT TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE SHE'S DONE A LOT OF WORK ON THIS BILL SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AS DESCRIBED ON PAGE ELEVEN AND TWELVE OF THE ANALYSIS MY SUPPORT WITNESS WILL BE DOCTOR MAYBE MILLER PROFESSOR IN THE SCHOOL OF. EDUCATION AT CSU CHICO AND RIGHT JAIL THE SORROW SENIOR COUNSEL PUBLIC ADVOCATES BOTH OF WHOM ARE FORMER EDUCATORS DOCTOR MILLER WILL BE PARTICIPATING THROUGH TELEPHONE AND IT MESSES WITH OUR WILL BE PARTICIPATING VIA THE OAK OP CONFERENCE. WELL FIRST. I WANT TO START WITH THREE REALLY IMPORTANT MISCONCEPTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN OUT THERE ARE NUMBER ONE ON THIS BILL AND THAT'S OVERSIGHT THE BILL REQUIRES THE CITY TO REPORTS SPECIFIED INFORMATION ON THE ASSESSMENT AND IT'S PROGRESS I ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE THERE HAS TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY AND WE HAVE TO HOLD THE COMMISSION ACCOUNTABLE. BUT TO UPDATE THE T. P. A.'S THE TPS WILL MERIT THE SAME RIGOR AND VALUE AS THE CURRENT ASSESSMENT THEY ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE UPDATES TO THE LEGISLATURE ON THE MISCONCEPTION OF WHOLE LANGUAGE WHICH I'VE HEARD OFTEN THIS BILL DOES NOT DIRECT THE TEACHING OF WHOLE LANGUAGE. THIS IS MISLEADING THE BILL IS SPECIFICALLY. IT SPECIFICALLY INCORPORATES FOUNDATIONAL READING SKILLS AND LITERACY SKILLS TO THE T. P. EIGHT THIRTY PAYS WILL BE UPDATED TO INCLUDE THE SCIENCE OF READING. IN A MANNER ONLINE TO THE CURRENT EMAIL A AN EMAIL THE FRAMEWORK THAT T. PIECE. ON STUDENT SUCCESS. I AM THE PROUD FATHER OF THIS BILL BECAUSE OF MY PERSONAL SEVENTEEN YEARS IN THE CLASSROOM. NOT ONLY AS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER BUT AS AN ADMINISTRATOR AND MASTER TEACHER WHO MENTORED MANY TEACHERS IN THE CLASSROOM. AND SO MY NUMBER ONE GOAL IS TO HAVE TEACHERS THAT ARE QUALIFIED. THEY'RE EFFECTIVE AND READY TO TEACH ON DAY ONE WE MUST DO BETTER BY OUR STUDENTS SB SIX ONE FOUR IS NEEDED BECAUSE THE CURRENT RICA IS FILLING OUR STUDENTS. PROSPECT PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS AND HAS DONE NOTHING TO PREPARE THOSE ALREADY IN THE CLASSROOM. I ACTUALLY TOOK THE RVCA TEST MANY YEARS AFTER I WAS ALREADY IN THE CLASSROOM IT DIDN'T MAKE ME A BETTER TEACHER. I TAKE THE TOUGH I PASSED IT. BY I WAS IN BETTER PREPARED. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION ADOPTED AN U. E. L. A. LD FREE MARKET THAT REFLECTS AN INTEGRATED APPROACH TO LITERACY DEVELOPMENT. THIS ASSESSMENT ADOPTED IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX IS NOT ALIGNED TO THE CURRENT K. TWELVE LA GUILTY FRAMEWORK. OVER ITS TWENTY FOUR YEARSTENURE RECALL HAS NOT BEEN SHOWN TO PROTECT EFFECTIVENESS IN THE CLASSROOM IN FACT. MANY OF MY TEACHERS ON THAT I MEANT. I HAD A ROUGH. TIME AND AGAIN BEING THEIR MENTOR I NEVER SAW THEM BE MORE EFFECTIVE BECAUSE OF THAT TEST. ADDITIONALLY IN A RECENT SURVEY BY LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE. REPORTING HAVING TEACHER CHARGES MEANWHILE THERE HAS BEEN A 30% DROP IN ENROLLMENT IN TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS OVER THE LAST DECADE. I WANT TO BE CLEAR. THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT MAKING IT EASIER FOR TEACHERS. TO PASS IT IS ABOUT IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION AND HAVING TEACHERS BETTER PREPARE ON DAY ONE. AND ALSO BRINGING DIVERSITY TO THE CLASSROOM BY ALLOWING TEACHER CANDIDATES TO FROM DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES TEACHERS OF COLOR AND CANDIDATES THEY LEARN BETTER BY ACTUALLY TEACHING IN A CLASSROOM SETTING. THEY NEED TO BE CHALLENGED BY REAL CLASS SITUATIONS AND ALLOW THEM TO BRING THEIR LIFE EXPERIENCE TO THE TABLE. THIS BILL REQUIRES ALL APPROVED TPS TO ACT A SAYS CANDIDATES FROM MULTIPLE SUBJECT AND EDUCATION SPECIALIST. FOR COMPETENCE IN INSTRUCTION IN LITERACY INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO FOUNDATIONAL READING SKILLS A LINE TO THE CDC'S CURRENT TEACHING PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS. THIRTY PAYS OR THE NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED GOLD STANDARD. IT IS THE ONLY ASSESSMENT THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO SIGNIFICANTLY PREDICT TEACHER EFFECTIVENESS AND IN TEACHING READING. FURTHERMORE AMENDMENTS WERE REQUIRE THAT THE RECALL REMAIN IN PLACE UNTIL JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND TO THE CDC HAS UPDATED THEIR TEEPEES. LASTLY I ALSO WANT TO BE CLEAR THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE CTC TO REPORT INFORMATION JUST LIKE THREE THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE THAT'S WHERE I WANT IT THE ABILITY TO BE. AND I HAVE QUESTIONS BUT SOME MEMBERS OF THIS DÃ­AS AND I'M CONSIDERING MAKING IT A LITTLE BIT MORE- MORE- UPDATING THEM MORE OFTEN THAN THAN THE REQUIREDON ON THE BILL SO AGAIN I ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE IN THE AND BETTER UP TEACHERS BETTER PREPARE TEACHERS ACCOUNTABILITY AND MAKING SURE THAT THERE ARE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS SO WE AS LEGISLATURE HERE CAN LOOK BACK AND KEEP HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE DOING WHAT THEY NEED TO DO. I'M I WILL DEFER NOW TO MY- MY WITNESSES THANK YOU. THE FIRST I BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ME ME MILLER FROM CSU CHICO WILD CAT. I BELIEVE MANY IS ON THE PHONE. THANK YOU CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M DOCTOR MEANING MILLER A PROFESSOR AT CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY CHICO FOR TWENTY YEARS I HAVE PREPARED ELEMENTARY TEACHERS OUR STATE ACCREDITED PROGRAM IS RIGOROUS. POTENTIAL CANDIDATES MUST EXACTLY COMPLETE COURSEWORK SATELLITE THE COMMISSION SANDERS SB. SIX HUNDRED HOURS OF SUPERVISED TEACHING AND MORE. ABOUT THE RATIONS OF THEIR CLASS TEACHER SKILLS. CANADA MUST HAVE KITCHEN PERFORMANCE AT THAT AND BY LITERATE IN MATH AND- DOCKING THERE TEACH WITH THE AND NARRATIVE AND SAID LET THEIR WORK TO CARE SPENT FOR VALUATION BY CALIBRATED ORDERS. IN ADDITION TO ALL THAT THEY MUST EACH PATH THEIR RICA. UNFORTUNATELY SOME OF OUR BEST AND BRIGHTEST A LETTER THE TEACHERS WHO HAVE MET AND EXCEEDED ALL OF THE STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN BLOCKED FOR THE. TEACHING PROFESSION BY THE RECAP. EVERY WHAT INTO A WAYS FOR IT HAS NOT BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE PREDICT VALIDITY. WE DO KNOW THAT A TEACHER WHO PASSED WITH THE RECAP AS A BETTER TEACHER THAN SOMEONE WHO DOES NOT HAPPEN. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE ESPECIALLY WANT OTHER ASSESSMENT LIKE FUTURE PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO PREDICT TEACHER EFFECTIVENESS. SECOND TICKET DOES NOT ALIGNED WITH CURRENT HEY THE DOCTOR'S STANDARDS ARE FRAMEWORK. THE CURRENT ID DOCUMENTS RETAIN THE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF READING INSTRUCTION INCLUDING FOUNDATIONAL READING BUT THEY ALSO INCLUDE A MUCH STRONGER EMPHASIS ON LANGUAGE ACQUISITION FROM BOTH NATIVE AND NON NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKERS. BECAUSE OF A LINE OUT OF DATE STANDARD THE RETEST CANADA ON SOME ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE NOT. UP TO DATE HAD A GUY NEEDED TO TEACH CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN. SB SIX FOURTEEN REMOVES THE RVCA AND INSTEAD ENSURED BUT THE ABILITY TO TEACH FOUNDATIONAL RADIO ACOSTA THROUGH STATE APPROVED TEACHER PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT THAT ARE BASED ON CURRENT STANDARDS. AND I VOTE ON THE X. FOURTEEN WILL ENSURE THAT NEW TEACHER TO ENTER CALIFORNIA'S CLASSROOM. DEMONSTRATED BUT THEY ARE OPEN TO TEACH THEIR STUDENTS HOW TO READ THANK YOU. GREAT YOU WILL NOW HEAR FOR A CASH FIREMAN. I'M SORRY I APOLOGIZE MIX THAT UP OF REGALE MASSARO- MISSILE I BELIEVE- FROM PUBLIC ADVOCATES IN THE WITNESS VIDEO ROOM REBEL AND IF I GET FIVE. YOUR NAME I APOLOGIZE YOU MAY CORRECT ME. MY NAME IS THE SORROW AND A FORMER TEACHER AND A SENIOR LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL A PUBLIC ADVOCATES. FOR NEARLY THIRTY YEARS WE'VE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR A ROBUST WELL PREPARE AND DIVERSE TEACHER WORK FORCE IS STRONG SUPPORT SB SIX FOURTEEN COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. TO ELIMINATE THE RVCA AND INSTEAD ADDS FOUNDATIONAL READING TO THE T. P. A. THE SCORE THAT ALIGNS WITH OUR VISION AND DOES NOT WATER DOWN OUR STANDARDS FOR TEACHER QUALITY. CALIFORNIA FACES A DIRE TEACHERS. EVERYTHING THE BENEFIT OF A NINE HUNDRED DOLLAR INVESTMENT THIS YEAR THAT WORKS CONTRACT WITH MY 10% BECAUSE OF CO. YOU ARE WELL AWARE MOST VULNERABLE IT IS JUST FORTUNATE BLANK OUR SERVER. IF EDGE. THREE NOT HELP STUDENTS. TEACHERS FOR OVER TWENTY FOUR YEARS AT NEVER BEEN SHOWN TO BE. A CLASSROOM PERFORM. PRE RECAST 88% OF STATES HAVE HIGHER READING SCORES CALIFORNIA AND AFTER TEN YEARS OF 387% STILL OUTPERFORMED US. THE M. REMAINS CULTURALLY UNRESPONSIVE TO NEW THINGS AND READING INSTRUCTION SUCH AS MODIFICATIONS FOR ENGLISH LEARNERS AND STUDENTS DISABILITIES INCLUDING. DYSLEXIA WITH THE C. BEST A C. SET THE REJECTS LOSE AT LEAST INTENDS TO TEACH. THE FIRST PASS RATE IS SIXTY FIVE PER. AND MORE TROUBLING THAT FOR BY AND LATINO X. CAN'T. CURRENT RESEARCH QUESTIONS THE EFFICACY AND BIASED OF STANDARDIZED TESTING SUGGESTING THAT PERFORMANCE IN MULTIPLE MEASURES ASSESSMENTS MORE ACCURATELY ASSESS KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS. THE TVA IS JUST SUCH AN ASSESSMENT ITS RESULTS ARE AGGREGATED AND REPORTED THE TP A IS A IS FAR SUPERIOR TO THE READ THAT AS A AS A VEHICLE TO. TEST FOUNDATIONAL REDUCED. ACCORDINGLY WE URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. BE SIX. FOURTEEN YEAH. THANK YOU ARE WILL NOW GO TO THE PUB WE'LL SEE IF THERE'S A INSIDE THE BUILDING INSIDE THIS ROOM RIGHT NOW THE WISHES TO TEST.

KIND IT SPEAK TO KIND OF HELP THIS IS GONNA OF IN A LOT OF PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS IN THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS BILL I RECOGNIZE WORK AS IT IS HAD GETTING RID OF THE RICA PERIOD RIGHT. AND. THE MORE THE PROMISE OF GETTING RATHER BECAUSE WELL SOME PEOPLE CAN'T PASS IT WHAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME BECAUSE WE TO THINK OF KIDS ARE. BUT WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO. HERE IS YOU TO GO A PAPER TESTS TO A PERFORMANCE TEST. YOU KNOW YOU YOU CAN. GET OF TEACH SOMEONE TO SHOW SOMEONE HOW TO BUILD A HOUSE AND THEN GET MY TEST ON IT OR YOU CAN TEACH SOMEONE SHOW SOMEONE HOW TO BUILD A HOUSE AND JUNGLE BUILD A HOUSE. RIGHT YOU'RE GONNA KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN DO IT. OKAY ONCE THEY'VE TRIED TO BUILD A HOUSE MORE THAN. YOU KNOW HOW THEY'VE ANSWERED ON PAPER TESTED TO ME. THIS MAKES COMPLETELY SET COMPLETE SENSE. I THINK IT'S THOUGHT THROUGH. I KNOW NOT EVERYBODY WAS IN LOVE WITH MY POSITION ON THIS BUT I CAN TAKE IT BECAUSE I DO THINK. CALIFORNIA TEACHERS. SHOULD BE ABLE TO TEACH READING IT SHOULD BE A SPECIFIC SKILL SET. AND THEY SHOULD BE TESTED SOMEHOW THAT SKILL SET JUST PUTTING IN. HANDING SOMEONE A PIECE OF PAPER TO HEY TAKE A TEST AND HOW HA HA HA. AND HOW WE READING ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH BIG BECAUSE- KIDS ARE HUMANS AND WITH KIDS COME ALL KINDS OF VARIABLES. AND I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT HAVING BEEN A CLASSROOM TEACHER FOR MANY YEARS. SO AGAIN- I APPRECIATE YOUR TENACITY SAYING THIS BILL. IN WHETHER AND I ALSO APPRECIATE THE PLEDGE RELAX I THINK IT IS A GOOD PLACE I THINK IT'S A PLACE. SIR CAN. CHILDREN BETTER. THAN THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST BY DISCOUNT. MOST PAPER STE TESTOR MUCH. OF THE. COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MR THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO I HAVE ONE QUESTION BASED ON THE OPPOSITION WE HEARD TO THAT I RECEIVED IN MY OFFICE SEEMS TO BE A CONSIDER AMOUNT OF CONCERN THE DYSLEXIA COMMUNITY COULD YOU SPEAK ABOUT WHAT THE EFFORTS WILL BE GOING FORWARD TO BE VERY INTENTIONAL ABOUT THE INCLUSION OF THAT COMMUNITY AS WE DECIDE WHAT THIS PERFORMANCE EVALUATION LOOKS LIKE AND HOW THEIR CONCERNS CAN BE ADDRESSED. YES THANK YOU AND CHAIR IF I MAY ASK WHAT BROUGHT DEL TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION AND THAT MEANT NO MORE COMPREHENSIVE WAY THOUGHT OKAY DON'T GET ON BOARD. GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN MEMBERS ARE RIGHT ON THE START WITH PUBLIC ADVOCATES- BUT WE READ THE CHAIR I THIS RICA ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH I JUST WANNA CORRECT- TO MISCONCEPTIONS STATED BY THE OPPOSITION. SO I'M NUMBER ONE THAT. WE ARE NOT ELIMINATING READING STANDARDS- THE AT CALIFORNIA'S ADOPTED. A LITERACY FREE MARKET AND STANDARDS ENCOMPASSES THE SCIENCE BASED MULTIMODAL READING INSTRUCTION DESCRIBED BY THE OPPOSITION. ON END AND ARE A TEACHER PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS ON FROM LITERACY RECENTLY- UPDATED AND ADOPTED BY THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING. INCORPORATE CALIFORNIA'S DYSLEXIA. LINES FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN. SO WE'RE LOOKING AT IS JUST AS THE CHAIR DESCRIBED TAKING A PAPER AND PENCIL TEST AND MAKE IT A- TRULY PROVE TO US THAT YOU UNDERSTAND HOW TO TEACH READING. AND NOT JUST- ON THE STANDARDS WE HAD IN NINETY FOUR BUT I'M THOSE STANDARDS PLUS AN UPDATE. PARTICULARLY FOR OUR HIGHEST NEED STUDENTS THINKING HERE AGAIN ABOUT. LIST LEARNERS UNDERSTANDING THE NEEDS OF DAHLE LANGUAGE LEARNERS AS WELL AS STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. INCLUDING STUDENTS WITH DYSLEXIA. AND ENTERED ME I I'M SURE I'M SURE THAT I'M SPEAKING. IN IN. WITH THE CENTER THE- LOVES YOU I'M CALL. CONNECT WITH WITH FOR EXAMPLE SHE TO KIND OF A RECORD STRAIGHT ON THE OTHER POINT I MADE BY THE OPPOSITION. THERE'S NOTHING NO KITCHEN. COUNTER AND WE'RE WE'RE TAKING. UNTIL TESTS AND ON. ONE AND- THE SAME AND ADDITIONAL. INTO A PROVEN PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT BOTH OUR ASSESSMENTS. THAT ARE AT THE STATE WHICH ARE DAMAGED BY OUR STATE BY A COMMISSION HE- COULDN'T WHICH- HAVE CHIU. WITH. THE HIGH STANDARDS FOR TWO AND- THANK YOU MUCH FOR THE EFFORT. TO GO BACK AND WANTED JUST WANNA REITERATE WE ARE IN THE FOR TEACHER TO TEACH AND INCREASE THE PROP THAT THOSE ARE ACTUALLY ABLE TO BE EFFECTIVE TEACHERS DAY ONE BECAUSE THEY HAVE PROVEN AND PERFORMANCE INSTEAD OF JUST ON A PAPER AND PENCIL TEST THANK YOU. AND IF I MAY ADD WAS IT WAS THE POSIT POSITION OF THE COMMITTEE THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE TOO PRESCRIPTIVE IN THE BILL BECAUSE WE MEANING MAY AND MANY OTHERS IN THIS ROOM ART BUT YOUR EXPERTS AND HOW TO TEACH READING YES I'VE TAUGHT READING I DON'T KNOW THAT I CONSIDER MYSELF AN ABSOLUTE EXPERT AND- SO WHAT WE'RE SEEKING IS HAND THIS OVER THE CTC. THEM WHAT CONSOLE THE EXPERTS ALSO TAKE STAKEHOLDER INPUT SO THOSE FOLKS WHO SPOKEN TODAY THAN MEN THAT FROM THE DYSLEXIC COMMUNITY AND BEYOND WHO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THIS APPROACH- THEY'RE NOT LEFT OUT THERE NOT WRITTEN INTO THE BILL BECAUSE NO ONE'S SPECIFICALLY. NO NO NO NO SPECIFIC CHALLENGES WRITTEN INTO THE BILL BUT AS THE NEW PERFORMANCE TESTED CREATED BY THE CDC THOSE FOLKS SHOULD BE OUT ROUTINE IS. THAT DEMANDING TO BE ALLOWED AND SO THAT THAT THEY CAN IT THIS IS A PROCESS IT'S JUST THE BILL'S GONE AND THAT'S IT WHERE OVER TO THE- TEACHING ANGELA. CAN TO DEVELOP THIS TO AGAIN A AS OUR EX. THAT THEY WILL TAKE. STAKEHOLDER INPUT AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT THEY WILL AS MANY TIMES. AS AS THEY USUALLY DO WHEN THEY- GO AND TAKE ON ENDEAVOR SUCH AS THIS. THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH OF WHAT THE AT THANK YOU BUT I PLEAD OF. IT WAS A CLOSE FRIEND HI CAN I DON'T DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING YOU WANT TO ADD NOT THAT I LIKE A CLOSE BUT I. DON'T. GOOD AFTERNOON CENTER RUBIO SO I AND AS I UNDERSTAND THIS BILL WELL AS AMENDED THE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN PLACE TO TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AT. AND THIS IS A GUT AND AMEND WE'RE DEALING WITH THIS DIDN'T START OF THE SENATOR WAS SOMEONE ELSE UNTIL RECENTLY. CAN I CLARIFY AT THIS BILL AND I JUST WANNA ADDRESS THE POINT THAT A GENTLEMAN MADE THAT WE SHOULD BE RUSHING THIS FOR THE-PANDEMIC SO I WANT TO MAKE VERY CLEAR THAT THIS BILL. STARTED LAST YEAR AND A BASED ON THE OPPOSITION'S RECOMMENDATION THEY ASKED ME TO PULL IT BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT LAST YEAR WAS TOO SOON AND I DID. AND SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING AN ENTIRE YEAR WITH OUR A LOT OF TAKE. AND KIND ME MY MEETING TO COME UP WITH. THAT EVERYONE CAN GET ON BOARD WITH AND I THINK THERE'S A MISCONCEPTION WHEN PEOPLE READ THE BILL BECAUSE I HEARD THAT WE'VE DWINDLE DOWN BE EXPECTATIONS TO ONE PARAGRAPH. THIS IS JUST THE BILL THAT'S GOING TO DIRECT YOU KNOW THE CITY IF YOU TO COME UP WITH A MORE COMPREHENSIVE- STANDARDS BUT I DID MEET WITH SOME AT THE OPPOSITION THE DYSLEXIA COMMUNITY AND I OFFERED THAT WE WOULD. TRY TO ENGAGE THEM SO THEY CAN HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE AS WELL SO I FOUGHT FOR THAT ALREADY. WELL THAT'S GREAT TO HEAR BUT I MEAN WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE- SAYS WOULD. LEAD MORE THOROUGH. IF FIVE. THE BILL HAS THE BENEFIT OF THE POOL LEGISLATIVE. WERE IT STARTS YOUR HOUSE RATHER THAN. GUTTING AMENDING. A FEW WEEKS BEFORE WE ADJOURN. I CAN I WILL JUST SAY THAT YOU KNOW YOU'RE RIGHT BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE THE STARTED LAST YEAR AND THAT'S WHY I PULLED IT BECAUSE- AGAIN TO GIVE IT UP A LITTLE BIT MORE REVIEW AND- MORE. FROM OUR STAKEHOLDERS SO IT'S NOT SEVENTY NOW WE JUST CAME UP WITH. A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK IT CAME DURING THE PANDEMIC THIS HAS BEEN WORKED ON SINCE LAST YEAR THAT'S NOT REALLY ECHO THE BILL RIGHT. I'M SORRY IT'S NOT REALLY A CODE RELATED BILL WELL IT IS AND I'LL SHOW YOU A WHITE BECAUSE OUT THE GOVERNOR JUST ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER. ALLOWS THE READER TO BE POSTPONED FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS SO RIGHT NOW THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE TO TAKE IT. AND SO THIS ALLOWS THE TIME DURING THE INTERCOM TO WORK ON SOMETHING THAT'S EFFECTIVE. ESSAY THIS I GUESS WHY NOT JUST- YOU KNOW IT GIVEN THAT WE HAVE THAT WINDOW WHETHER IT'S FIVE YEARS WHETHER IT TOLD TWENTY FOUR. OH WHAT NOT YOU KNOW INTRODUCED ON MY THIS IN JANUARY WE CAN GO THROUGH A FULL. PROCESS HOPEFULLY WE CAN HAVE FOLKS IN THE ROOM TO TESTIFY AND YOU KNOW IN WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH A BILL THAT'S EVOKED AS POWERFUL OPPOSITION FROM DYSLEXIA TICKETS FROM. RIGHTS GROUPS ON OUTLOOK THE EXPERTS FROM AT ASC FROM. FROM STUDENTS. IN IS TOUCHING UP ITEM IMPORTANT ISSUES. WHY DON'T WE JUST THAT WE'RE TO YOU KNOW. DEAL THIS ISSUE. NEXT WE CAN IN. FOR DID FOR. YOU OUT THOSE AND SEE THE BEST THIS IS UP AND IN YOUR ADDRESS THAN HAVE THIS RUSH. SISTER. VERY YOU KNOW CAREFULLY- YOU KNOW BOB FINDING GAUGING IN THE PROCESS SO IT'S NOT LIKE ANY OTHER BILL THAT WE RUSHED TO THE SESSION. THIS IS BEEN A YEAR LONG PROCESS AND AS MUCH AS WE HAVE. OPPOSITION WE ALSO HAVE SUPPORT AND I AGAIN. I WILL DEFINITELY ENCOURAGE THEM TO JOIN US IN THE PROCESS. NOW THE MORE WE WAIT THE MORE WE RUN. THE ABLE TO. AFFORD MY AND I FEEL THAT THE MORE. THAT THE SOONER WE GET GOING IN THE MORE WE CAN THAT. HAVE OVERSIGHT HAVING AGE MEN PARTICIPATION TO MEET THE MORE. THE SOONER WE START THE MORE ON EFFECTIVE PROP PRODUCT WE WILL HAVE. YEAH I UNDERSTAND THAT AND I KNOW THAT YOU'VE WORKED HARD TO GET AS MUCH INPUT AS POSSIBLE AND THE BILL HAS EVOLVED BUT- YEAH EVERYTHING YOU JUST MENTIONED THAT HAPPENED OUTSIDE OF PUBLIC VIEW BECAUSE THERE WAS NO. ACTUAL BILL THAT WAS MOVING THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. AND SO I YOU KNOW WOULDN'T WE BE BETTER POSITION HAVING DONE ALL OF THAT WORK THAT YOU'VE ALREADY DONE. TO THEN TAKE THAT AND HAVE A PUBLIC PROCESS NEXT YEAR. FOR SOMEONE THAT'S NOT GOING TO TAKE A FACT FOR A FEW YEARS AND SO THERE'S NO SENSE OF URGENCY TO IT. WELL I'M AGAIN I YOU KNOW I RESPECT YOUR YOUR COMMENTS BUT I DO FEEL THIS IS A PUBLIC PROCESS YOU'VE HEARD ALL THE- PEOPLE. THAT ENGAGED IN A CONVERSATION I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN TO SO MANY HOURS. ZOOM WITH A LOT OF THE DYSLEXIC COMMUNITY TRYING TO ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS EDUCATE I'M SO IT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT I DIDN'T ENGAGED IN. THEY CANNOT TEST ALL THE HOURS I SPEND WITH SO MANY DIFFERENT GROUPS CELL. I FELT THAT I DONE MY DUE DILIGENCE IN TRYING TO- NOT ONLY YOU KNOW A CAR FIVE SOME. CONCEPTIONS BUT ALSO GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE A TAPE. KIM THANK. THANK YOU THEIR COMMENTS THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SEE NO FURTHER COMMENTS FROM ANY OF THE COMMUNITY YES DOCTOR. I WANT TO THANK THANK YOU FOR THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT YOU PUT INTO THIS AND FORTUNATELY HE CALLED ME TODAY AND I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH YOU. IN A AND I'M GOING TO SUPPORT IT IN THIS COMMITTEE AND WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE GET TO THE FLOOR BECAUSE I DO WANT TO MOVE FORWARD AND SEE WHAT EVERYBODY THINKS ABOUT IT. MAINLY BECAUSE- I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW I FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT THE CURRENT WHATEVER WE'RE DOING IS NOT WORKING. AT ALL THAT WE HAVE NOT MASTERED THE IDEA OF TEACHING CHILDREN TO READ. AND THAT IS THAT FUNDAMENTAL THING I MEAN IT DOESN'T SEEM MOST EVERYBODY HERE LEARN TO READ AND SO YOU WONDER. WHAT IS THE PROBLEM HAVEN'T WE MASTERED IT. AND OTHER STATES HAVE. TRIED DIFFERENT THINGS AND THEY HAVE A LOT OF. HANDS ON ASSESSMENT AND MENTORING AND ALL THOSE THINGS THAT WE TALK ABOUT BUT WE NEVER GET AROUND TO DOING. AND WE HAVE OVER THE YEARS TAKE A SHORT CUT OF GIVING PEOPLE A TEST. THING IF THEY HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE. AND I'VE RUN ACROSS SOME EXTREMELY IT. UP INTELLIGENT. EDUCATORS WHO ARE TOTALLY INEFFECTIVE WHEN IT COMES TO TEACHING KIDS. THEY COULDN'T THEY HAVE MEMORIZED EVERYTHING THERE IS THEY KNOW ALL THE BOOKS IN THE ALL THE THEORIES AND WHAT HAVE YOU. BUT THE WHOLE IDEA OF HAVING A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE STUDENTS. AND FIGURING OUT THE THINGS THAT CAUSES DOOMED TO HAVE BARRIERS IN CERTAIN AREAS WITH THIS AFTER. OUR PARTY OR READING OR WHATEVER AS THEY JUST BEAR. SO AND THE DIFFERENT CAN SEE BETWEEN THE PERFORMANCE OF KIDS WHO CAN READ IN THOSE WHO CAN'T IT IS. AMAZING AND MEET. AT EVERY. I FEEL FRESH. AS YOU KNOW OF. THANK YOU FOR FIVE YEARS ALL WHO CAN READ I MEAN WE COULD LITERALLY READ AND THEN THE A COP EVER UP SOME WHAT THE HECK GOING ON YOU KNOW AND SO THIS IS SUCH A ISSUE AND SO I KNEW I WAS NO WE CAN'T DO GET RID OF IN THAT STUFF IN PLACE. WHICH IS GIVEN SOME DIRECTION AND FIVE THAT'S A THAT YOU THAT YOU NEED TO SET IN THIS IS THAT WE GET RID OF IT NOW ONE OF TO COME WILL OKAY LOW PUT THIS PLACE AND I'VE HAD FOR WITH THIS ELIMINATING CBS NOT THAT I'VE BEEN THE BEST CELL MATE BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE BEEN IN PLACE AND SO SOMETIMES WE MADE IT AND LAW IS THE COLD AS AN- WELL YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE TIME DO THIS AND THAT. AND OUR KIDS ARE- AND AS A RESULT OF THAT WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A HUGE NUMBER TEACHERS TO DROP ON AND IT'S A SHORTAGE AND SO OUT WHICH CHANGE KIDS BUS YEAH PROBLEM WE HAVE A KIND AND IS NOT A- THAT THANK GOODNESS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT SOME OF THE UP OF HIS ABOUT. HIS PEOPLE TO ADVANTAGE WHICH WHEN YOU GET AND SO THEREFORE YOU JUST EIGHTY ALL REQUIRED WHICH TO ME IS A IS A RECIPE VAST BECAUSE I CAN DESTROY WHAT DOES THIS LEARNING STUFF THAT'S GONNA. AND IT'S A WHOLE HORDE OF KIDS WOULD NOT BEEN AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS HAVE TO. DO THE FIRST. TO THAT PROCESS. WE TALKED. IT AND I AND I DON'T HAVE A MUCH. FAITH IS PEOPLE HAVE. IT THE SYSTEM WORKING. OKAY THAT IT'S GONNA WERE. BETTER DID THE- CREDENTIALING PEOPLE GOING TO DO THEIR JOB. WHAT I'VE ASKED HER TO DO IS TO. DO MORE THAN WAIT FOR FOUR YEARS. FOR THE LEGISLATURE. BUT TO HAVE THESE PEOPLE COME BACK TO US AND REPORT TO US WHAT THEY'RE DOING. YEAH SO DO WE GET A SENSE OF IT AND THAT GIVES US FOR YEARS OR THREE YEARS TO SAVE. YOU A BILL NOT THAT WE WILL KEEP RECALL IF YOU CAN REPEAL IT AND MOVE ON. BUT WE HAVE TO START THE PROCESS BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO HAVE THE OVERSIGHT OF THE LEGISLATURE. BECAUSE IF WE JUST WAIT WE JUST SAY IS TO BE DONE AND FOR YEARS I'VE SEEN. WHAT SOMETIMES HAPPENS CVE PEOPLE GET ALL WHILE THEY TAKE THE THING THIS-PRIORITY FIRST. AND I'VE HAD SEVERAL TIMES THEY CALLED ME AND SAID WELL WE CAN IMPLEMENT YOUR BILL THIS YEAR WE HAVE TO WAIT TO MAKE FEAR. BECAUSE WE HAVE A BUTTON THAT MONEY WOULD HAVE WHATEVER. AND I DON'T WANT THIS TO FALL OFF THE OFF THE CLIP. IS FOR. IT FOR YOU MOST BEFORE. THE KIND SEVEN. THE SOME OF NOT EVEN BE HERE FOUR YEARS OLD. IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING THAT THAT THEY COME BACK TO. WITH US ON A REGULAR BASIS AND I'VE ASKED HER TO MEND BE ABLE. TO BASICALLY DO THAT IT HAS SOME ACCOUNTABILITY AND IT NOW THEY SAID THEY COME BACK IN FOUR YEARS BUT- BY. WE DON'T. WANT TO AND YOU WON'T HAVE A COPY. OF IN. THIS SINCE OUR- THINK IT IS. ARE WE RUSHED OF THINGS IN THE WE'VE LIMB THING ALL THE WITH THINKING WHAT COMES PLACE THIS IS SO I'M BECAUSE WE WE'RE DOING. IS NOT WORKING PERIOD IF YOU BEING ABLE TO A TEST AND SAY YOU CAN MASS THE SKILL IT IS NOT WORKING AND WE SEE THAT NOT ONLY THIS BUT ALMOST EVERYTHING ELSE WE HAVE TO HAVE VERY STRONG MENTORING PROGRAMS TO CREATE GREAT TEACHERS AT OUR SYSTEM WILL NOT IMPROVE. WILL NOT IMPROVE WITHOUT THREE TEACHERS PERIOD IT'S NOT I DON'T CARE HOW MANY COMPUTERS WITH THAT I MEAN YOU HAVE KIDS WHO IN TURN ON THESE COMPUTERS BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE SCHOOL PERIOD THEY'VE NOT DONE WELL IN IT TURN IT ON IS NOT WILL MAKE THEM ANY BETTER IN THEIR MIND AND SOUL WE YOU CAN'T BUY LOVE AKE NOT. TO SCHOOL WITH AND NOT UP BUILDING A BILL TO IMPROVE OUR SCHOOLS IT'S NOT THAT DOUBLES THE BUT WE KNOW THAT THE RIVER IS LAG IN THE RELAY BETWEEN THE THAT INTENT THE AND STUDENT. THE TRYING A- HAPPENS TO PAY AND TO PARTICIPATE LIKE QUITE IN SCHOOL BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE TO DETERMINE THE KIDS READ AND THEY ALL THAT CAN WE YEAH THEY HAVE NO COMPREHENSION THE COLUMN. SO ALL THE REAL WRESTLING THAT CONTENT THAT AND THAT'S DELAY AT THAT'S GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY THE WORK YOU GOTTA THAT'S- TO MAKE IT SO I'M GOING TO BUT IT'S- MAYBE. AT AND I. POURED OUT WE- WAITING IN LATE AND WHAT. AND DOING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AND THINKING GET DE RESULTS. TEST TEST TEST THESE PEOPLE BE TEACHER WE SAY THAT FOR. AND THEY'RE STILL EFFECT OF IN THE CLASS. AND IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY THEY MAY MASKED THE FEAR. BUT THEY HAVE NOT ABLE INPUT IT AND PRACTICE AND THAT'S WHAT REALLY MATTERS SO. I THANK YOU I KNOW YOU'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK I KNOW WOULD WE WILL HERE LAST YEAR AND SALAS. SINCE THEN YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ALL THESE GROUPS. AND I THINK THAT THIS LEXUS COMMUNITY IS NERVOUS AND THEY SHOULD BE. IT'LL ADD AND THEY SHOULD BE GREATLY INVOLVED AND ENGAGED IN WHAT'S TAKING PLACE. BUT FOR EVERY OTHER MAN WHOSE KID IS FAILING IN OUR DISTRICT SHOULD BE GREATLY CONCERNED. AND DEMANDING INPUT AND I'VE IN SOME OF THE- FOLKS TESTIFYING BECAUSE THEY NEED TO BE AT THE TABLE. TO MAKE SURE THE WHAT WE'RE DOING IS RIGHT. WE ALSO HAVE TO BE THERE SO I'M HOPING SHE WOULD DO THE AMENDMENTS. PLEASE HAS THE. A REPORT. ALSO THE CAN INSURE THAT WHAT PEOPLE TELL US THAT TO DO IN IN IN THE COULD DID FOR BUT THEY HAVE BEGUN TO AND IF THEY HAVEN'T THERE'S SOME FOR IN MONEY WHATEVER WHATEVER WE SHOULD BE THE LAW OF FIGHTING FOR THEM TO GET THE THEY TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN BECAUSE READING IS FUN EVERY KNOWS THAT AND OUR KIDS NEED TO HAVE A GREAT READING SKILLS IF THEY'RE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD OTHERWISE IT A LOT OF THE STRUGGLE AND STRUGGLE YOUR REST. YEAH YOU I SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY AS WELL I THINK IT'S INTERESTING MISTER CHAIR THAT WE HAVE SO MANY ISSUES AND EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE OF CODE IN THE- TRUNK LET'S LIVE SESSION WERE SPENDING. ALL THE TIME ON THIS BILL. I THINK THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER. ISSUES DEALING WITH. OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR READING AND- DURATION OF OUR TEACHERS AND THE EVEN OPPORTUNITY GAP. AND I DO GREATLY APPRECIATE THE OPPOSITION AND THEIR CONCERNS AS FAR AS READING SCORES IN CALIFORNIA I KNOW YOU SAID THE SAME THING BUT- I DON'T KNOW. IF THESE TWO THINGS APART CONFLATED IN AN APPROPRIATELY IN OTHER WORDS- BY PUSHING THIS BILL ARE WE SAYING ONE WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT. AND TO IT'S GOING TO WORSE AND- THAT SHE MET FOR READING CALIFORNIA I DON'T I DON'T SEE THAT THAT'S THE CASE AND- I DO THINK THAT THIS HAS A LARGER ISSUE WERE THEY WERE TRYING TO. ADDRESS AND THAT. TEACHING THAT CAST WE KNOW FROM ALL KINDS OF THINGS DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK. THANK YOU SAID YOUR EXPERIENCE AND HONEST O'DONNELL TALKED ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE IN THE CLASSROOM AS WELL. AND I DO THINK THAT WE NEED TO BROADEN THE BASE WHO'S A TEACHER IN CALIFORNIA I'D I THINK THAT- THIS CAN ONLY HELP NOT THE PANACEA THEY'RE ALL KINDS OF OTHER ISSUES WERE LOOKING. TO ADDRESS- BUT- I AND I APPRECIATE LEARNING ABOUT THIS AN AGING PARENT. I THINK THE YEAR WORKING TO MAKE IT BETTER AND I APPRECIATE. YOUR EFFORTS AND WITH THAT I WILL. SUPPORT THE BILL MAKE THE MOTION SUPPORT RIGHT NOW SO I CAN CAN. START YEAH. SAY NO FURTHER CONTACT MOTION IS TO MODIFY VEHICLES IT JUST REALLY QUICK I FIRST OF ALL I THINK THE DOCTOR WEBER IDEA COMMIT TECH THAT DAY AND WE BOTH ABILITY IS REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE FOR ME AS WELL AND I APPRECIATED HER SUGGESTION ABOUT YOU KNOW WORKING ON SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW ALLOWS THEM TO UPDATE THIS YEAR HE VERSUS YOU KNOW FOR YEARS BUT I REALLY WANT TO TAKE THE TIME TO ACKNOWLEDGE ALL THE PARENTS THAT IT ON THE TEACHER. THE EDUCATE COMMUNITY IN FACT I'M STOOD. ON AND SO UNDER. FIRST SOME THE KIND. AND ABSOLUTELY VALLEY I WOULD BE CONCERNED IF I HAD A CHILD BUT I WANTED TO JUST REITERATE THAT OUR GOAL IS TO MAKE IT BETTER AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. AS A TEACHER I CAN SAY FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS IS. IT'S THE LACK OF CLASSROOM EXPERIENCE I'VE SEEN TEACHERS. YOU KNOW BUT YOU KNOW GET A REALLY HIGH SCORES IN THEIR COLLEGE AND THEY PASSED THE RE GOT A COMMENT AND WITHIN MONTHS THEY QUIT THE PROFESSION BECAUSE THEY CAN'T HANDLE THE CLASSROOM EXPERIENCE. THIS WILL. DEFINITELY BE I'M IT THERE IN THE SENSE THAT THE TEACHERS WILL HAVE THAT CLASSROOM IT IT'S- AS EACH OF THE NON OPERATED. ARE HERE COME PLANNED THE PERFECT LESSON PLAN. BUT EVERY CLASS IS DIFFERENT YOU GET TO THE CLASSROOM AND IT'S NOT A PERFECT LAST. HAVE TO DEAL. YOU KNOW DIFFERENT.
