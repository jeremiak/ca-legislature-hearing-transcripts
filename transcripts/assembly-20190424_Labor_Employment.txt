APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS SERVE A VARIETY OF IMPORTANT PURPOSES BOTH ARE EXPANDING THE SKILLED WORKFORCE AND PROVIDING APPRENTICES COMPETITIVE WAGES. THE EARN AS YOU LEARN MODEL HAS PROVEN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN PROVIDING ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITY TO THE JOB MARKET FOR ALL WORKERS. WHILE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS HAVE CLEAR BENEFITSFOR STUDENTS. THE CURRENT ACADEMIC CLIMATE IN HIGH SCHOOLS OFTEN EMPHASIZES COLLEGE PREPAREDNESS WHILE THE BENEFITS AND OPPORTUNITIES OF APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS FOR STUDENTS. EXITING HIGH SCHOOL ARE COMMONLY OVERLOOKED. EVEN IF STUDENTS WERE PROVIDED THE INFORMATION ON THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. THEY ARE OFTEN UNAWARE OF WHAT LOCAL APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS ARE AVAILABLE AND HOW TO ACCESS THEM.

GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS -- AB TWELVE NINETY ONE CLARIFIES THE TIME FRAME FOR WHEN CANNABIS BUSINESSES NEED TO COMPLY WITH. LABOR PEACE AGREEMENT REQUIREMENTS LABOR PEACE AGREEMENT IS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE BUSINESS AND A LABOR ORGANIZATION THAT PRESCRIBES THE OBLIGATIONS OF EACH PARTY. THESE AGREEMENTS TEND TO INCLUDE MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL PROVISIONS THAT PROTECT BUSINESSES AND FACILITATE THE ABILITY FOR EMPLOYEES TO ORGANIZE CURRENT LAW REQUIRES THAT CANNABIS BUSINESSES WITH MORE. WITH TWENTY OR MORE EMPLOYEES INTERRELATE FOR PEACE AGREEMENT WITH THE UNION AS PART OF THE APPLICATION PROCESS TO OBTAIN A CANNABIS LICENSE. BUSINESSES ARE REQUIRED TO STATE THAT THEY WILL ENTER LABOR PEACE AGREEMENT IF THE BUSINESS HAD NOT ALREADY ENTERED. ONE HOWEVER CURRENT REGULATIONS ARENOT CLEAR OF WHAT ON WIND THIS RE REQUIREMENT NEEDS TO BE FILLED. REGULATIONS SAY THAT THESE REQUIREMENTS SEEM TO BE MET AS SOON AS REASONABLY PRACTICABLE WOW THAT'S A BIG WORD WHICH IS VAGUE AND OPEN TO INTERPRETATION. A. B. TWELVE NINETY ONE WERE REQUIRE BUSINESSES WITH TWENTY EMPLOYEES OR MORE TO ENTER LABOR PEACE AGREEMENT WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OR EMPLOYING THEIR TWENTIETH EMPLOYEE. THIS MEASURE WILL PREVENT ARBITRARY ENFORCEMENT AGAINST CANDICE BUSINESSES AND PROVIDE EMPLOYEES WITH CLARITY ON WHEN AN EMPLOYER IS FAILING TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW. WITH ME TO DAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE IS JAZZY GRAY WALL FROM UFC W.. MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE BOAT. GOOD AFTERNOON THAT CHAIR AT JAZZ YOU GRAY ALL REPRESENTING YOUR C. W. WESTERN STATES COUNCIL OUT OVER THE PAD SPONSORS THAT AB. TWELVE NINETY ONE I'M AND I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE THANK YOU THANK YOU.

MR TO REMEMBERS MITCH SNIDER WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO IN SUPPORT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MATT BROWN WITH THE TEAMSTERS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION OKAY. WELL. ANY ERA COMMENTS IN WELL FIRST OF ALL I APPRECIATE BEING THIS BILL THAT DOESN'T JOY AND I RECOGNIZE FROM THE CHAIR AND THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE I WENT TO THE SUIT OUR CONSULATES RIGHT IN OAKLAND. NOTHING TO DO WITH IT -- ANY CLOSING COMMENTS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU -- SNOOP DOGG. ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL. WOULD YOU LIKE TO PLEASE -- PRESENT ON A. B..% ONE SIXTY AND EACH SIDE HAS UP TO WE'RE NOT REQUIRED TO USE SIX MINUTES FOR EXPERT TESTIMONY -- IF YOU HAVE ANYONE THAT YOU LIKE TO TESTIFY OTHERWISE WHICH WILL HELP PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES I THINK I'M THE EXPERT. I'M NOT A I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF PRESENTING AB. ONE SIXTY FOR THE EIGHTH YEAR IN A ROW. A BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW A PRIVATE EMPLOYER THE ABILITY TO ENACT A VOLUNTARY VETERANS PREFERENCE PROGRAM. THE VOLUNTARY VETERANS PREFERENCES RECOGNIZE THAT ENJOYED AMONG PUBLIC EMPLOYERS HOWEVER PRIVATE EMPLOYERS ARE LIMITED TO ONLY VIETNAM WAR HERO THE VETERANS WHEN EXERCISING THEIR VOLUNTARY VETERANS PREFERENCE. AND IT'S OBVIOUS THAT MOST VIETNAM VETERANS LIKE MYSELF. OR RETIREE OR LEAVING THE LABOR FORCE SO. THAT PREFERENCE DOESN'T REALLY HELP ANYBODY. AB ONE SIXTY SIMPLY REVISES AN UPDATE OVERSIGHT BY ALLOWING PRIVATE EMPLOYERS TO EXERCISE OUR VOLUNTARY VETERANS PREFERENCE TO ALL VETERANS WITH THE GENERAL OR HONORABLE DISCHARGE. REGARDLESS OF THE ERA IN WHICH THEY SERVE. SIMILAR VOLUNTARY VETERANS PREFERENCE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN ENACTED IN THIRTY SEVEN STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND HAVE MANAGED TO STAY COMPLIANT WITH THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR NONE OF THESE STATES HAVE BEEN SUED. SO WORKS. AND IT BURKE HABITS DISCRIMINATION IN HIRING THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT THERE'S NO REASON CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOT BE CAPABLE F THE SAY. I UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS. FOR THOSE REASONS MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS TO TO CLARIFY -- THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS -- AS SOME MAIN. NO TWELVE DAYS AGO THE TRANSGENDER BAM INTO A FACT -- BUT THIS ADMINISTRATION PUT IN PLACE THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT IS TO MAKE THE BILL'S PROVISIONS CONTINGENT ON REVERSAL OF THE TRANS GENDER BAND AND ARMED FORCES. AND THIS PRESUMPTION OR ALSO MAKING SURE THAT NO OTHER PROTECTED CLASSES ARE DENIED OF A SERVICE IN THE MILITARY I DO APPRECIATE. THE AUTHOR FOR ACCEPTING THAT AMENDMENT WITH THE RECOGNITION THAT UNTIL EVERYONE CAN SERVE -- THAT THAT -- THAT THIS PART THAT THIS PROGRAM EVEN THOUGH IT APPLIED ALL VETERANS -- WOULD EXCLUDE SOME IN OUR COMMUNITY AND SO I APPRECIATE THE ACCEPTANCE OF THAT COMMITTEE AMENDMENT -- MISTER VOEPEL. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS ALICE KESSLER HERE ON BEHALF OF A QUALITY CALIFORNIA AND WHILE WE CERTAINLY APPLAUD THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS EFFORTS -- TO INSURER EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR VETERANS -- EVEN WITH THE AMENDMENT THAT THE COMMITTEE'S PROPOSED UNFORTUNATELY WE DO HAVE REMAINING CONCERNS -- BUT FIRST JUST FUNDAMENTALLY -- THE WAY THIS IS STRUCTURED -- TO GIVE A PREFERENCE TO ONE GROUP THAT'S PROTECTED UNDER FEE HA -- IT YOU KNOW IT DOES DISADVANTAGED THE OTHER PROTECTED GROUPS -- UNDER THE LAW AND AND THAT IS PROBLEMATIC FOR US. IN ADDITION -- YOU KNOW DON'T ASK DON'T TELL WAS ONLY LIFTED IN TWENTY ELEVEN THERE ARE MANY YEARS WHERE MANY MEMBERS OF THE LGBT COMMUNITY WERE. EXCLUDED FROM MILITARY SERVICE AND WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THE PREFERENCE -- AND AS WELL THE CURRENT BAND -- AND ALL OF THE FOLKS THAT ARE GONNA BE PRECLUDED WHILE THAT BAND IS IN PLACE -- SO UNFORTUNATELY FOR THOSE REASONS WE WE MUST OPPOSE THE BILL BUT WE CERTAINLY DO. APPRECIATE THE ASSEMBLY MEN'S EFFORTS -- AND AND INTENT WITH THE BILL THANK YOU THE PROJECT THAT ANYONE ELSE OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MARIE GO YOUR SHE HARD WITH THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION. RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION -- APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF THE BILL AND YOU KNOW OUR OUR ATTORNEYS REPRESENT SERVICE MEMBERS AND VETERANS AND DISCRIMINATION AND USER TYPE ACTIONS AND UNDERSTAND THE EMPLOYMENT BARRIERS THAT THEY FACE. THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE IS THAT THIS CREATES A PREJUDICIAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN VARIOUS PROTECTED CLASSES UNDER THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT. AND WE KNOW THAT WOMEN AND LGBT INDIVIDUALS ARE UNDER REPRESENTED IN THE VETERANS POPULATION AND THE WHOLE REASON WHY. A BILL LIKE THIS IS NECESSARY WHY WE NEED STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION IS BECAUSE THERE IS THIS PRESUMPTION NOT SUCH A VETERANS PREFERENCE POLICY IS DISCRIMINATORY. BECAUSE IT HAS AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON WOMEN IN LGBT INDIVIDUALS. SO -- FOR THOSE REASONS WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE OPPOSITION. NOT WILL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE. I WANT TO THANK YOU -- FOR BRINGING FOR THIS BILL IT'S AN IMPORTANT BILL I I A I RECOGNIZE THAT I MAY HAVE. DIFFERENT OPINIONS THAN SOME THAT WERE STATED STAY BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THAT AS SOMEBODY IS WILLING -- TO TO OFFER UP. THEIR LIFE IN SERVICE TO THIS COUNTRY THAT SOMETIMES WE WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE LAWS CAN. CONTINUE TO ALLOW FOR THEM TO BE EMPLOYED AFTER THAT SERVICE -- I DO AT I'M NOT EVEN I I UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE DOING AS FAR AS THE TRANS GENDER BAND I UNDERSTAND WHAT'S. BEING DONE AND WHAT'S BEING SAID EVEN ABOUT. THE DON'T ASK DON'T TELL HOWEVER OF COURSE I I KNOW A NUMBER OF VETERANS WHO SERVED UNDER GOD MASSIVE TELL THAT THAT WERE IN FACT A IT WAS UNFORTUNATE THAT THEY HAD TO HIDE. BUT THERE THERE ARE NUMBER OF LGBT Q. -- VETERANS FROM THAT ERA I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE IF SOMEBODY WAS DISHONORABLY DISCHARGED FOR BEING GAY. IN THE MILITARY THAT THEY WOULD STILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS THERE [inaudible] SO YES. I AM SOMEWHAT EXPERT IS AREA THE IN A VETERAN. THIS BILL WAS AMENDED TWO YEARS AGO -- TO GIVE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO THE WHOLE LGBT Q. COMMUNITY. THE WAY THE MILITARY WORKS IS IN ORDER TO GET A DISHONORABLE DISCHARGE YOU HAVE TO BE COURT MARTIALED. OKAY AND CONVICTED. AND THAT'S A BIG DEAL IN THE MILITARY. SO. 99% OF GAYS AND I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE PRESENT IS. PERCENT IS BUT IT'S GOTTA BE SOMEWHERE AROUND THERE. THAT RECEIVED A DISHONORABLE DISCHARGE LIKE ANY OTHER VETERAN. COMMITTED CRIMINAL ACTS EXCEPT. NOW THIS BILL AND IT'S A LITTLE TRICKY IF YOU'RE NOT MILITARY I INCLUDED. ANYONE THAT WAS DISCHARGE UNDER HONORABLE CONDITIONS A GENERAL DISCHARGE NO A GENERAL DISCHARGE WAS USED BY THE MILITARY FOR MANY YEARS THE BASICALLY GET RID OF DON'T ASK DON'T TELL PEOPLE. SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT RESTORES EQUALITY AND HONOR. TO THOSE VETERANS AND THEY WILL HAVE THE SAME PREFERENCES ANYONE ELSE SO I'M PROUD FROM AN L. G.. VIEW POINT. TO SUPPORT THIS CAN I GET EMOTIONAL ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT'S AN INJUSTICE SO WELL POINTED OUT. THAT THIS BILL CORRECTS -- SO -- THE OPPOSITION. I'M ALWAYS CONFUSED I DON'T THINK THEY REALLY UNDERSTAND THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF THIS BILL. AND BECAUSE WE'RE HOLDING IT UP FOR TRANS GENDER FROM THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION I WELCOME THAT. TOO BECAUSE THAT'S FAIR I GET IT OKAY -- ONE OTHER COMMENT IF I MAY YES PLEASE [inaudible] SO. 80%. THERE ARE SEVENTEEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED VETERANS IN CALIFORNIA THEY GET OUT OF THE MILITARY EVERY YEAR. SO IT'S NOT A LARGE POPULATION HAS A SMALL POPULATION AND 80% MAYBE 78% ARE IN LISTED PEOPLE THE JOINED UP FOR FOUR YEARS WENT TO WAR PTSD EVERYTHING ELSE. AND THEY HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION MAY BE A LITTLE BIT OF COLLEGE SO THERE'S THREE THINGS THESE VETERANS HAVE TO DO OTHERWISE OAKLAND UP HOMELESS AND SCREWED UP ON YOU. AND THAT IS ONE GET A JOB. TO GO TO SCHOOL. AND THREE STAY OFF THE HARD DRUGS. AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE MOST VETERANS INCLUDING ME WILL BE DRINKERS [inaudible] OKAY. AND IT'S THE ONES ARE GOING TO THE DRUGS THAT SLIDE OFF THE RAILS. SO -- IN A CONTROLLED DRINKER A BITE AT THAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU WHEN THERE'S NOT PEOPLE I I DON'T WE HAVE WITNESSED A QUORUM RIGHT NOW OKAY SO IF WE CAN -- DO WILL CALL FORM PLEASE MADAM SECRETARY KALRA [inaudible] LARA [inaudible] CARILLO [inaudible] DEEP [inaudible] GONZALEZ. JONES SAWYER PRESENT THREE OF US. WITHOUT A MOVING NOW THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- AND SO WE DO HAVE A MOTION -- AND THE YOU KNOW AND THIS I I ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND AND THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION BUT I DO APPRECIATE -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL IS I TRULY BELIEVE YOUR SINCERITY AND NOT TRYING TO HARM. ANYONE AT THINK ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AMENDMENT. ISN'T WHAT YOU THE MOMENT I MENTIONED TO YOU WITHIN SECONDS YOU AGREED TO IT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT YOU MOLD OVER YOU UNDERSTOOD THAT -- BUT WITH THE TRANSGENDER BAN ON ITS FACE THIS BECOMES. A BY ITSELF A DISCRIMINATORY POLICY AND SO WE HAVE TO CLEARLY ALLOW FOR THAT TO BE LIFTED -- AND ABOUT -- I I UNDERSTAND IT YOU'RE ABOUT TO BELIEVE IT ALL THE ONLY VIçT NAM VETERAN. REMAINING IN THE LEGISLATURE. SO I KNOW YOUR COMMITMENT TO VETERANS IS THERE BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT. YOU'VE TAKEN A LOT OF TIME IN YOUR COUPLE YEARS HERE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH SOME WITH -- BUT ALL OF US BUT IT WAS MORE LGBT Q. -- MEMBERS IN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND BETTER -- HOW YOU CAN DEVISE A BILL OF THAT IS MORE FAIR I UNDERSTAND THE OPPOSITION POSITION JUST BASED ON SHEER NUMBERS ALONE -- MAKE IT SUCH THAT -- IT MAY TAKE MANY YEARS -- FOR FOR THE UP OPPOSITION TO CONSIDER THIS TO BE A TYPE OF POLICY THAT WOULD BE TRULY A GLOBAL. AND SO I UNDERSTAND BOTH SIDES THEN THERE'S GONNA BE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION ON IT I DO BELIEVE THAT -- ME YOUR INTENTIONS ARE ARE CLEAR -- IT DOES ENJOY AN AYE RECOMMENDATION IS ALL ALLOW YOU -- TO MAKE ANY CLOSING REMARKS [inaudible] PLEASE. WITH THAT MASSACRE CALL THE ROLL. QUESTION IS DO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE KALRA AYE KALRA AYE FLORA CARILLO [inaudible] DEEP. HI DEEP I AND SALAS. GONZALEZ SIDE JONES SAWYER HI JONES SAWYER I THREE OF US DOUGLAS ALL RIGHT SO THAT THE BILL IS OUT AS PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS THANK YOU AS WELL THANK YOU. BUT IF WE CAN HAVE A MOTION ON THE WE HAVE SIX CONSENT ITEMS WE CAN OF MOTION THOSE. WILL MOVE. OKAY -- I'M GOING. TO SO THE BILLS ON CONSENT -- CONSENT TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE AB. FIVE NINETY FOUR AB. TEN NINETEEN AB TEN TWENTY EIGHT A. B. TWELVE NINETY NINE AB. FIFTEEN FIFTY FOUR AND WE HAVE AB FOURTEEN FIFTY FOUR WHICH IS -- DO PASS CONSENT TO THE FLOOR. OKAY KALRA AYE KALRA AYE FLORA CREO. DEEP BY DEEP AYE GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I JONES SAWYER BY JONES SAWYER I THREE OF US -- RAY CONSENT CALENDAR IS OUT -- WE HAVE MR LE VIAN. HERE ON ITEM EIGHT IS THAT RIGHT AND WHAT IS YEP THIS WILL BE IN PLEASE. ITEM [inaudible] EIGHT THAT IS. AB SEVEN NINETY AND AS I INDICATED PREVIOUSLY IF YOU DO HAVE WITNESSES HAVE UP TO SIX MINUTES ON EITHER SIDE PLEASE FANTASTIC THANK YOU SO MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS EIGHTY SEVEN NINETY WOULD REQUIRE COMPANIES OPERATING IN CALIFORNIA BY. TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND ANNUALLY THEREAFTER THAT HAVE A MARKET VALUATION OVER ONE BILLION DOLLARS TO PAY SUBCONTRACTED SERVICE WORKERS WAGES THAT ARE TIED TO CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT HOUSING. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT'S INCOME LEVELS FOR THE COUNTY THEY ARE SUBCONTRACTED TO WORK IN THESE COMPANIES SHALL BE REQUIRED TO PAY A WAGE TO CONTRACTED SERVICE WORKERS THAT. IF PAID FOR EIGHT EIGHT HOUR WORK DAY OVER A FORTY HOUR WORK WEEK WOULD EQUAL AN ANNUAL WAGE THAT IS 85% OF H. CD'S AREA MEDIAN INCOME. MAJOR CORPORATIONS ARE MAKING THE BIGGEST PROFITS IN HISTORY AND ARE NOW RECEIVING SIGNIFICANT CORPORATE TAX CUTS INITIATED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP. IN ADDITION CORPORATIONS ARE INCREASINGLY CONTRACTING OUT SERVICE LABOR LEAVING THESE WORKERS WITHOUT AN EMPLOYEE TITLE THESE WORKERS INCLUDE STAFF SUCH AS SECURITY GUARDS BUS DRIVERS CUSTODIAL STAFF FOOD SERVICE WORKERS. LAUNDRY WORKERS WINDOW CLEANERS AND OTHERS. DUE TO THIS CLASSIFICATION AS A CONTRACTED OR SUBCONTRACTED WORKER THESE WORKERS ARE ALMOST ALWAYS NOT RECEIVING THE HIGHER WAGES THAT REGULAR EMPLOYEES GENERALLY RECEIVE FOR THE VERY SAME WORK. THE FAIR WAGES REQUIRED BY THIS BILL WILL HELP CLOSE THE UPWARD MOBILITY AND INCOME INEQUALITY GAPS THANK YOU AND I ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT ANYONE OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TESTIFIED TODAY MY NAME'S LAURA CURTIS I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. WE ARE HERE IN OPPOSITION TO AB SEVEN NINETY BECAUSE WE FEEL IT WILL ARTIFICIALLY INCREASE THE COST FOR THESE TYPES OF SERVICES -- WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE BILLS WELL INTENTIONED HOWEVER IF YOU LOOK AT THE COST OF THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT. MANY PROFESSIONS SUCH AS DOCTORS LAWYERS ARCHITECTS AS WELL AS LOWER WAGE WORKERS I'M IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY THAT'S EIGHTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR IF YOU'RE LOOKING 85% OF THAT THAT SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. THIS IS A VERY HIGH COST WE ARE AFRAID THAT THIS WILL IN ADDITION TO ARTIFICIALLY -- DRIVING UP THE COST OF THESE SERVICES IT WILL ALSO ELIMINATE JOBS FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT CURRENTLY HAVE THESE JOBS ON A CONTRACT BASIS. BECAUSE MORE COMPANIES WILL HIRE THESE PEOPLE IN HOUSE IN ORDER TO TO A MULTITUDE OF DIFFERENT -- TASKS RATHER THAN HIRING EACH ONE INDIVIDUALLY ADDITIONALLY WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE COMPLIANCE BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THAT IF A COMPANY IS VALUED AT A BILLION DOLLARS. THEN THEY HAVE TO PROVIDE THIS COST -- AND IF THE VALUATION GOES UP OR DOWN IT'S UNCLEAR HOW THE EMPLOYER IS GOING TO COMPLY WITH THE CONTRACT FOR THIS. ADDITIONALLY THEY WILL BE IN BREACH OF CONTRACT LET'S SAY IF THE EMPLOYEE MAYBE WORKS THIRTY FIVE HOURS THAT WEEK RATHER THAN A FULL FORTY THESE ARE CONTRACT INTO -- WORKERS WHO THE EMPLOYER DON'T IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR KEEPING TAP A TRACK OF EVERY HOUR EVERY MINUTE THAT THEY WORK. AND WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THEY WILL BE IN VIOLATION OF THE CONTRACT IF IT INDIVIDUAL WORKS MORE OR LESS FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR IN HIS OFFICE. AT TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU. THEY WANT US IN OPPOSITION. THE CALL RIGHT CALIFORNIA MANY FACTORS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION ALSO POSE FOR THE REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED THANK YOU THANK YOU. I BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] THE MOTION. AND IS THERE ANY MOTION ON THIS. HE IS OUR SECOND. ALL RIGHT UP THANK YOU MISS LEVINE I THINK IS IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO HAVE AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT OPPOSITION -- WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THESE ISSUES I THINK THAT WE MEAN BEING AND SILICON VALLEY -- ACTUALLY RECOGNIZED INCOME INEQUALITY THAT'S OCCURRING ACTUALLY RECOGNIZE THAT THAT WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT THIS BILL RECOGNIZES THAT -- THEY'RE PROBABLY A LOT OF DIFFERENT ANGLES TO APPROACH THIS ISSUE AND I THINK THAT THE CONVERSATION HOPEFULLY -- WILL HELP ILLUMINATE DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER WITH OUR EMPLOYERS WITH LABOR -- AND WITH OUR COMMUNITIES TO ENSURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO MOVE IN THE DIRECTION TOWARDS COMBATING INCOME INEQUALITY SO. FOR THE FOR THOSE REASONS I DOES ENJOY AND I RECOMMENDATION -- AND YOU MAY CLOSE. YET THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE STAFF HAVE BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY HELPFUL AND AND CRAFTING THIS LEGISLATION. I WAS REALLY. HEARTENED TO HEAR SOME OF THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS ABOUT POSSIBLY MAKING MORE EMPLOYEES OUT OF THEIR CONTRACTED WORKERS WERE THEY MAY BE ABLE TO GET BETTER BENEFITS AND HIGHER WAGES. THE APPROACH THAT THIS BILL TAKES RECOGNIZES THAT IN IN YOUR DISTRICT AS WELL AS MINE MANY OF OUR DISTRICTS THE AVERAGE RENT OF AN APARTMENT IS APPROACH IS TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. AT FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR WHEN WE GET THERE THAT IS THE WHOLE PAYCHECK FOR THE MONTH THERE IS NO WAY. TO HAVE A SECURE FUTURE OR TO GET BY WITHOUT SINKING DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO DEBT -- FOR SO MANY HARD WORKING FAMILIES AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN HELPING ADVANCES TODAY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. A BAND CENTRIC POLO PLEASE. MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS KALRA AYE KALRA AYE FLORA CREEL. DEEP NO DEEP NO GONZALEZ. GONZALEZ I JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER I THREE OF US. SO PLACE AT THE BILL ON CALL THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU MISS GONZALEZ. ASSEMBLY IS ALSO ITEM. TWO EIGHTY FIVE FORTY SEVEN YOU READY TO GO. A LOT OF PEOPLE I THINK -- INTEREST IN THIS. ONE SO WE HAVE UP NEXT AB. FIVE FORTY SEVEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ. AND AS NOTED PREVIOUSLY UP TO SIX MINUTES FOR EACH SIDE -- CAN BREAK IT UP ANYWAY YOU'D LIKE. AND I DO NOT HOLD THE TIME FOR IT IF THERE IS ANY TRANSLATING SORRY I DON'T KNOW THAT TIME AGAINST. JUST A PROCEDURAL QUESTION WE ARE ACTUALLY DEBATING THIS -- I THINK MOST MEMBER SPEAKS SPANISH WOULD YOU LIKE A TRANSLATION DO WE HAVE TO HAVE A TRANSLATION IT'S REALLY UP. TO I WOULD PREFER TRANSLATE OKAY THE RECORD JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I AM. WE HAVE A TRANSLATOR. I DO MY TRANSLATION -- THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO CHECK ON THAT. AT GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR -- IN WELCOME WHAT AN APPROPRIATE DATE TODAY TO BE HEARING THIS BILL -- IT'S DENIM DAY AND OF COURSE WE TALK ABOUT A SEXUAL ASSAULT AND THIS BILL REALLY CAME OUT OF SEXUAL ASSAULT IN THE WORKPLACE SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON WITH OUR JANITORIAL SECTOR FOR MANY YEARS NOW. AND BEFORE THE ME TOO MOVEMENT CAME ALONG OF COURSE THERE WAS THE OUT BASKET MOVEMENT -- STARTED BY THESE REALLY BRAVE -- WOMEN WHO SERVE IN A JANITORIAL SECTOR TO SAY THAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT AND RAPE ON THE JOB WAS NOT OKAY -- WE HAD AN INITIAL BILL THAT CREATED REGISTRY AND PROVIDED FOR TRAINING AND AS WE ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH THAT BILL WE REALIZE THAT THE TRAINING -- THE JANITORS CANON SHOULD RECEIVE WOULD BE MOST APPROPRIATE TO COME FROM THEIR PEERS FROM OTHER JANITORS TO HAVE AN ATTORNEY COME IN AND TEACH. ON JENNER'S WITHOUT THE THEIR LANGUAGE WITHOUT THEIR CULTURE ABOUT HOW -- TO PREVENT TO UNDERSTAND THEIR THERE WERE LAWS HOW TO PREVENT SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT REALLY DOESN'T MATCH UP WITH THE EXPECTATIONS OF OUR JANITORS. SO THEY CAME BACK WITH ANOTHER BILL LAST YEAR TO TRY TO ENSURE THAT THE TRAINING COULD BE DONE BY -- PROMOTE TOLD US OUR PEER REVIEWERS THEMSELVES -- IT'S A GREAT DEAL UNFORTUNATELY -- OUR LAST GOVERNOR IN HIS A SPLASH OF SIGNING ME TO BILLS SEEM TO LEFT OUT ALL WORKING CLASS WOMEN. AND THIS WAS ONE OF OUR MANY VETOES THAT WE GOT SO WE'RE BACK WITH IT BECAUSE IF THERE'S ONE THING YOU CAN LEARN FROM OUR OUR JANITORS IS THEY ARE UNWILLING TO STOP AT A NOW -- SO WITH THAT I HAVE. I HAVE FOLKS HERE READY TO TESTIFY AND TRANSLATE THANK YOU. HI A GOOD AFTERNOON I'D LIKE TO THANK THIS COMMITTEE ENTER KALRA FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY BEFORE YOU -- MY NAME IS CENTER AND RE GUESTS AND I'M THE CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION AGAINST SEXUAL ASSAULT APPRECIATE THOSE OF YOU CAME OUT TODAY FOR DENIM DAY AND WEARING. JEANS TODAY. AND I'M HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF FIVE FORTY SEVEN THE JANITORIAL WORKERS SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND HARASSMENT PREVENTION TRAINING BILL. FOR DECADES SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIMS OR SURVIVORS AS OUR PREFERRED TERM HAVE BEEN RISING UP TO SAY ENOUGH. TO SAY WE DO NOT ACCEPT ABUSE AS INEVITABLE IN OUR LIVES. THIS BILL IS THE SPIRIT BY WITH EACH THE ANTI VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN MOVEMENT WAS BUILT BEGINNING IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES. THE MOVEMENT HAS ACCOMPLISHED A LOT BUILDING A STATEWIDE SAFETY NET DEDICATED TO LIMITING SEXUAL ABUSE AND ELEVATING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT. MISCONDUCT AND ABUSE. UNFORTUNATELY OUR EFFORTS IN THE PAST FORTY EIGHT YEARS OVERLOOKED CERTAIN COMMUNITIES. MUCH LIKE ANTI RAPE ADVOCATES DID IN THE SEVENTIES. TODAY MANY OF THESE COMMUNITIES ARERISING UP ALSO TO SAY ENOUGH. BASTA. WE CANNOT WAIT ANY LONGER. WE WILL TAKE HEALING TRAINING AND PREVENTION EFFORTS INTO OUR OWN HANDS. CALIFORNIA'S JANITORS ARE ONE SUCH GROUP. THEY ARE A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE HAD THE COURAGE TO COME FORWARD AND EDUCATE MANY OF US ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES IN THE WORKPLACE. THEY HAVE ALSO SPENT THE LAST THREE AND A HALF YEARS BECOMING EXPERTS IN THE DRESSING AND PREVENTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT MISCONDUCT AND ABUSE ON THE NIGHT SHIFT. I AM HERE TODAY TO SUPPORT A. B. FIVE FORTY SEVEN WHICH WOULD RECOGNIZE THESE WORKERS AS EXPERTS. NOT ONLY IN THEIR LIVED EXPERIENCE AS JACK AS JANITORS BUT ALSO SO UNIQUELY SUITED TO BE PEER TRAINERS WHO DELIVER THE IN PERSON SEXUAL VIOLENCE. AND HARASSMENT PREVENTION TRAINING TO EMPLOYERS AND COVERED WORKERS. AB FIVE FORTY SEVEN CALLS FOR PEER TRAINERS TO COMPLETE A MINIMUM FORTY HOURS ON THE VARIOUS ASPECTS. OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ABUSE TO DATE. MY ORGANIZATION THE CALIFORNIA COALITION AGAINST SEXUAL ASSAULT HAS TRAINED WELL OVER A HUNDRED WORKERS TO DELIVER THIS PEER TRAINING. ADDITIONALLY EACH SUCH TRAINER WILL RECEIVE A MINIMUM OF TEN HOURS OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TRAINING EACH YEAR AS WELL AS MEET ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS OUTLINED IN THIS BILL -- CALCOT SAYS. OR A SURE THAT EACH OF THE TRAINED PEER. TRAINERS AND EDUCATORS RECEIVE TRAINING WHICH COVERS THE CONTENT AND MEETS THE STANDARDS OF THE STATE CERTIFIED TRAINING. THAT ALSO RECEIVED -- BY THOSE WORKING ON BEHALF OF SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIMS IT'S THE SAME TRAINING WHICH RAPE CRISIS ADVOCATES WHO HAVE COMPLETED WOULD HAVE COMPLETED FOR THE LAST THIRTY WE YEARS. BY WHICH THEY HAVE BECOME QUALIFIED AS PEER ADVOCATES AND TRAINERS. IN THE ANTI SEXUAL VIOLENCE MOVEMENT WE KNOW THAT PEER EMPOWERMENT AND TRAINING MODELS WORK. CALIFORNIA NOT LAW ALSO RECOGNIZES THE VALUE OF THESE MODELS. PEER MODELS WORK BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THOSE AFFECTED BY SEXUAL VIOLENCE ARE EXPERTS IN THEIR OWN LIVES. AND AS SUCH ARE THE BEST SUITED TO DEVELOP VICTIM CENTERED STRATEGIES. PIERRE TRAINING FACILITATES THE DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION BECAUSE TRAINERS ARE OFTEN SEEN AS BEING APPROACHABLE AND ARE RECOGNIZED FOR HAVING WALKED IN. OTHER ISSUES. EDUCATION HAS ALSO BEEN SHOWN TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN OTHER TYPES OF ADULT LEGIT EDUCATION IN TERMS OF CHANGING BEHAVIORS ATTITUDES AND NORMS. JANITORS KNOW BEST THE WAYS IN WHICH UP SEXUAL HARASSMENT MISCONDUCT AND ABUSE PLAY OUT IN THEIR INDUSTRY. RECOGNIZING THEM AS PURE TRAINERS WOULD HELP TO BUILD STRENGTH IN THE LABOR MOVEMENT FIND STRENGTH. AND AGENCY WHEN THEY CAN BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION TO THEIR OWN PLIGHT. TODAY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD. IN BUILDING WORKER CENTERED SOLUTIONS YOUR VOTE HERE TODAY -- PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY TO CATALYZE A TRANSFORMATION IN THE JANITORIAL INDUSTRY AND BY EXTENSION OTHER INDUSTRIES WHO CAN ALSO ADOPT SIMILAR PEER MODELS. SEXUAL ABUSE IS NOT INEVITABLE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THAT QUITE A BIT THIS MORNING. IT CAN BE PREVENTED AND I ASK THIS COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT GENDERS AND BEING PART OF THE SOLUTION TO AND ABUSE WITHIN THEIR INDUSTRY BY MOVING THIS BILL FORWARD AND I ASK FOR YOUR A BOAT. THANK YOU ABOUT TWO MINUTES REMAINING -- AND AGAIN THE TRANSITION WILL BE HELD AGAINST THE PLEASE FEEL FREE TO BEGIN. OKAY -- MY EVEN A STATUS PRESIDENT THAT KARA E. HONORARY MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE. NUMBER IS GOING TO HIT ON YOU MIGHT THE BOTTOM AS A ONE OF A KIND ITEM HAD AND JUST DIDN'T GET THAT.

CHAU SHOP SHOWED CHINA LIGHT ON THE VIOLENCE. THE CULTURE OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE AT THE WORKPLACE. A YEAR LATER IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WE SUPPORT AB NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT SPONSORED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ FOR STATUS OF REGISTRY OF WORKERS IN THE INDUSTRY. AS WELL AS TO PROMOTE THE TRAINING TO PREVENT SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE AT THE WORKPLACE WELL THEN YOU MUST COME ALSO TO BE INVISIBLE THAT I THINK ABOUT THE STATUS YOU GONNA COME BECAUSE ON THE COMBAT LUCK WITH THAT THANKS TO GOD GIVE HIM THAT ELEMENT. CAñADA ELEMENT THAT BY THAT LIMIT THE VIOLENCE THAT IS SIX ONE TODAY WE COME BEFORE YOU ARE SURVIVORS.

ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MORE CURTIS HERE FROM THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TESTIFIED TODAY WE ARE SYMPATHETIC TO THE ISSUE AT HAND -- WITH REGARD TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT SEXUAL ASSAULT AND VIOLENCE AND CAL CHAMBER AND ITS MEMBERS OBVIOUSLY -- DO NOT SUPPORT ANY TYPE OF ACTS OF VIOLENCE LIKE THAT OUR CONCERNS WITH THE BILL ARE WITHIN THE NUANCES -- BUT WE ARE UNDER THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER IS COMING OUT WITH REGULATIONS SPECIFICALLY ON THIS TOPIC AND WE DO AGREE WITH THE PREVIOUS VETO MESSAGE IN THAT WE SHOULD ALLOW FOR THE TIME FOR THOSE REGULATIONS TO COME OUT AND THEN DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT CHANGES NEED TO BE. MADE ADDITIONALLY OUR CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL -- DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT THE THE CURRENT VERSION ATTEMPTED TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE ADDITIONAL DUPLICATIVE -- NATURE OF ADDITIONAL TRAINING HOWEVER IN SUBDIVISION SIX D. IT STILL SAYS THAT SOMEONE NEEDS TO BE HIRED IN ADDITION TO THAT -- SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINER THAT IS PROVIDED WITH REGARD TO THE GOVERNMENT CODE REGULATIONS THAT WOULD MEAN YOU HAVE TO HIRE APPEAR TRAINER IN ADDITION. TO THE OUR GOVERNMENT CO TRAINER AND THAT'S ONE OF THE CONCERNS ADDITIONALLY THE STATUTORY MANDATE WITH REGARD TO PAY AND THEN THAT THE LIST OF ENTITIES THAT COULD PROVIDE THIS TRAINING CONTROL THE MARKET PLACE. AND SO OUR CONCERN IS IS THAT THEY WOULD ADD ONS UNNECESSARILY DRIVE UP THE COST FOR THIS TYPE OF TRAINING AND CONTROL WHO CAN PROVIDE THE TRAINING CURRENTLY UNDER THE GOVERNMENT CODE AS LONG AS YOU ARE QUALIFIED TRAINER. YOU MAY PROVIDE THE TRAINING WE THINK THAT THAT'S A BETTER -- ASSESSMENT IF YOU ARE QUALIFIED AND CAN MEET THOSE STANDARDS AND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO TRAIN RATHER THAN TO HIRING OFF THE LIST OF FOR THE FOR THE THOSE ARE OUR CONCERNS AS OF NOW AND WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. NOT MOBILE BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE. ALL RIGHT -- I'D BE HAPPY TO MAKE A MOTION IN SUPPORT. OF THE BILL. SECOND WE'LL MOTION ON THE FLOOR -- AND I WANT TO THANK US ORGANS ALSO ONCE AGAIN -- BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD -- I WANT TO THANK THE WITNESSES THAT -- AT BOTH THE WITNESSES AS WELL AS THOSE I SPOKE IN SUPPORT -- YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TENSION ATTENTION THE LAST COUPLE YEARS AND RIGHTFULLY SO THE ME TOO MOVEMENT. THAT HAS HAD SOME OF THE THE ATTENTION OF HOLLYWOOD. IN LEGISLATIVE HALLS LEGISLATURE IN CORPORATE AMERICA BUT I WANT TO COMMEND THESE JENNER'S THAT BEFORE THE ME TO MOVE AND WE'RE RAISING ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE -- AND YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE REMEMBER WATCHING RAPE ON THE NIGHT SHIFT WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT. AND I THINK THE COURAGE HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED -- UP BY THE THE THE THE JANITORS MANY OF WHOM ARE HERE TODAY BUT IN GENERAL THROUGHOUT THIS NATION. AND RAISING ATTENTION BEFORE IT WAS COOL BEFORE IT WAS HOLLYWOOD BEFORE IT WAS POPULAR -- BUT I I THINK DESERVES A GREAT DEAL OF CREDIT. AND SO I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE THAT CAME OUT AND EVERYONE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THREE FOUR FIVE YEARS -- PLUS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISING ATTENTION -- THAT HAVE BEEN FIRED THAT HAVE BEEN HARASSED FOR RAISING ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE FOR YOUR COURAGEOUS NESS -- AND I I'D EXTEND GREAT GRATITUDE AND ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT THIS BILL AND IT DOES -- IT DOES HAVE AN AYE RECOMMENDATION FROM THE CHAIR AND I'M HOPEFUL. THAT WE CAN GET THIS TO THE GOVERNOR'S THAT ARE NEW GOVERNOR'S DESK AND AND FINALLY MOVE ON THIS I THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO HAVE THOSE DOING THE TRAINING THAT UNDERSTAND. HOW TO TRAIN THOSE THAT ARE PUT IN SITUATIONS THAT CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS I THINK IT MAY IT WILL MAKE FOR A SAFER AND HAPPIER WORKPLACE WHICH I THINK WILL MAKE FOR A? BETTER EMPLOYEES FOR THE EMPLOYERS TO SO I THINK IT IT REALLY IS A WIN WIN SITUATION AND WITH THAT. SOME OF HIS OFFICE WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE I WOULD AND JUST IN IN TERMS OF THE OPPOSITION IT SEEMS FROM THE COMMENTS YOU DON'T TRULY UNDERSTAND THE IMPETUS BEHIND THIS BILL. AND THAT THE TRAINERS THEMSELVES HAVE TO ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND THE WORKPLACE THE CULTURE -- THE THE EVEN COUNTRY OF ORIGIN OF THE FOLKS WHO -- THEY'RE TALKING TO IT IS VERY EASY FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT I GUESS FROM A QUALIFIED TRAINER TO COME IN AND SAY DON'T LET SOMEBODY TO THIS TO YOU. THAT'S AN EASY THING WE'VE ALL BEEN THROUGH SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING AND WE'VE SCOFFED AT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE TOLD TO US. BUT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT LARGELY A FEMALE POPULATION WHO IS WORKING BY THEMSELVES AT NIGHT OFTEN AFRAID OF BEING EXPOSED FOR THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS BEING -- HAVING THEIR SPOUSES BE TOLD SOMEHOW THEY'RE COMPLICIT IN THIS -- CONCERN ABOUT THEIR COMMUNITY -- THEIR WORKPLACE THE THE I I WOULD VENTURE TO SAY ANYONE WHO HAS WATCHED RAPE ON THE NIGHT SHIFT UNDERSTANDS WHY THE MOST APPROPRIATE TRAINER TO TRAIN ABOUT THE SUBJECT WOULD BE ANOTHER JANITOR SOMEBODY WHO UNDERSTANDS AS CONDITIONS. THEIR THEIR POSITION IN LIFE IN WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THEM AND ALSO UNDERSTAND THE FACT THAT WE COMING HERE WHO DON'T HAVE THE SAME PROTECTIONS OF LOT FROM THEIR COUNTRY OF ORIGIN. AND DON'T KNOW THE SPECIFICS OF WHAT -- IS APPROPRIATE IS NOT APPROPRIATE IN FROM THE ROLE OF THE JANITOR TO BE ABLE TO ASK THOSE QUESTIONS IN A COMFORTABLE SETTING NOT TO SOME STRANGER THAT YOU DON'T KNOW BUT SOMEBODY WHO HAS -- WHO UNDERSTANDS YOU AND AND UNDERSTAND YOUR LANGUAGE IS IMPERATIVE AND SO I DON'T KNOW QUITE FRANKLY -- I I I HOPE. THAT THAT PERHAPS PEOPLE HAVEN'T SEEN RIP ON THE NIGHT SHIFT COULD SEE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE AND HAVE TO I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT BAD JOKES SIR. OR INAPPROPRIATE COMMENTS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RAPE AND ASSAULT AND HOW WOMEN CAN PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM THAT I ALSO WHEN AND WITH ONE LOOK NO TO REALLY THINK -- OUR OUR MAIL JANITORS WHO CAN I HAVE SEEN SO MANY MALE JANITORS COME OUT IN THAT THAT SHOWS JUST HOW FAR WE'VE COME IN THIS MOVEMENT AND HOW FAR. ON THE EMPOWERMENT OF THESE WORKERS HAVE MATTERED BOTH -- TO THEMSELVES AND TO OTHERS SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY ABOUT THINK TYLER. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MEMBERS CAN -- PREVENTS ACTOR CALL WILL PLEASE. MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS KALRA AYE KALRA AYE FLORA. CARILLO. DEEP. HI DEEP I CAN SALAS AYE GONZALEZ I JONES SAWYER THREE OF US. OKAY SO PLACE THAT BILL ON CALL. END OF THE SUMMER BECAUSE WE DO HAVE A A SIGN OR AND THIS IS YOUR COMMITTEE MEMBER WOULD YOU.

ASSEMBLYMEMBER BONTA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND AND COLLEAGUES AND STAFF THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB SEVENTEEN FORTY EIGHT THIS BILL CONFORMS THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY RIGHTS ACTOR CA. F. OUR A TO THE UNIQUE WORK SCHEDULE AND CIRCUMSTANCES A FLIGHT CREW MEMBERS. AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY DONE. THE CFRA ALLOWS FOR EMPLOYEES TO TAKE TWELVE WEEKS OF PAID OR UNPAID JOB PROTECTED LEAVE AND KEEP THEIR SAME HEALTH COVERAGE IF THEY HAVE WORK. TWELVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY HOURS IN THE PREVIOUS TWELVE MONTHS UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THEIR WORK FULL TIME FLIGHT CREW MEMBERS WORK A SCHEDULE OF THREE TO FOUR DAYS AND THIS DOES NOT MAKE THEM ELIGIBLE FOR THE CFRA. THIS MEANS THAT DURING VULNERABLE TIMES FLIGHT CREWS DO NOT HAVE ALL OF THE PROTECTIONS OF THE C. F. R. A. MOST NOTABLY THEY MAY. NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP THEIR EMPLOYER PROVIDED HEALTH INSURANCE AB SEVENTEEN FORTY EIGHT WOULD MORE APPROPRIATELY USE THAT FEDERAL FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT WORK OUR REQUIREMENT OF FIVE HUNDRED AND FOUR HOURS FOR FLIGHT CREW. CFRA ELIGIBILITY SO THAT DURING FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE -- FLIGHT CREW MEMBERS WITH WHAT UP ONE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT BEING UNINSURED AND THEY CAN FOCUS ON THEIR FAMILIES I BELIEVE IS THE COMMON SENSE MEASURE. THAT EXTENDS VALUABLE BENEFITS OF THE CFR A TO OUR FLIGHT CREWS. AND RESPECTFULLY ASK THE AYE VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU AND WE HAVE A NO WITNESSES TODAY WE HAD A WITNESS THAT WAS.

MR O'DONNELL ITEM NINETEEN AB. SIXTEEN THIRTEEN ARE YOU READY MISTER CHAIR. ALL I'M READY OKAY AND YOU LOOK AT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBER. AB SIXTEEN THIRTEEN DEFINES PUBLIC WORKS TO INCLUDE CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITY PROJECTS THAT RECEIVE FUNDING THROUGH CONDUIT REVENUE BONDS. THIS WOULD ENSURE THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK ON THESE PROJECTS RECEIVE PREVAILING WAGES AND ALLOW THEM TO BENEFIT FROM APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. CONDUIT REVENUE BOND FINE IS FINANCING COODINATED BY A NON PROFIT OR PUBLIC ENTITY. SUCH AS THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL FINANCING AUTHORITY UNDER THE TREASURER'S OFFICE. THE STATE LOSES REVENUE ON THESE BONDS AS INVESTORS DO NOT PAY TAXES ON THEM. INTERN THE BORROWER BENEFITS BY RECEIVING LOWER INTEREST RATES. UNDER EXISTING LAW CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES THAT ARE FUNDED BY THE STATE EDUCATION BONDS ARE REQUIRED. TO COMPLY WITH PREVAILING WAGE AND HIGHER CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS UNDER THE FIELD ACT. PROJECTS THAT AREN'T FUND THAT ARE FUNDED WITH CONDIT BOND REVENUE BONDS DO NOT. WE MUST ENSURE THAT THOSE WORKING ON THESE STATE SUBSIDIZED PROJECTS ARE SKILLED AND QUALIFIED THIS IS A POLICY THAT KEEPS GIVING. APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS MIDDLE CLASS JOBS WHICH HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT. ON OUR PEOPLE AND OUR ECONOMY. THIS BILL IS MODELED AFTER A BILL THE COMMITTEE PASSED A FEW YEARS AGO DEFINING PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS TO INCLUDE GENERAL ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS. FUNDED. BY CONDUIT REVENUE BONDS WITH ME HERE TODAY A CAESAR DAY IS FROM THIS CALIFORNIA STATE BUILDING TRADES AND CONSTRUCTION COUNCIL. THANK YOU. PLEASE THIS FEATURE MEMBER SAYS RDS ON BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL -- THE PROVINCES OF THIS BILL WHEN THE THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBER DAHLE FOR CARRYING IT -- WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS A NEW FINANCING MECHANISM THAT HAS BEEN SORT OF COLLABORATING OR EXPANDING -- OVER TIME AND OVER TIME WE'VE DONE IS ALLOW THE LABOR CODE TO KIND OF CATCH UP WITH A LOT OF THESE NEW FINANCING MECHANISMS THAT ARE PROVIDED TO PRIVATE ENTITIES FOR ESSENTIALLY PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS. WHEN YOU BUILD USING THE PREVAILING WAGE YOU'RE ACTUALLY CREATING MIDDLE CLASS JOB OPPORTUNITIES AS WAS STATED BUT ALSO EMBEDDED IN THE PREVAILING WAGE IS PENSION AND HEALTH CARE AND A PARTNERSHIP CONTRIBUTIONS TO GIVE BACK TO THE PRESSURE PROGRAM SO THEY COULD TRAIN THE NEXT GENERATION OF SKILLED WORKERS? WE'VE ALSO CREATED A PIPELINE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH MANY COMMUNITY GROUPS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ENSURE THERE'S PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS FOR A PRESSURE PROGRAM PREPARATIONS. THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST IN THAT BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING AT TARGETED POPULATIONS I FOR EXAMPLE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY INCARCERATED EMANCIPATED YOUTH IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM WOMEN WHICH ARE TRYING TO GET MORE WOMEN TO THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES. WHEN A PUBLIC WORKS PROJECT CARRIES A PREVAILING WAGE IT CARRIES A LOT OF THOSE REQUIREMENTS TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S ACCESS FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO WORK ON THOSE PUBLIC WORKS? NOTHINGIS MORE IMPORTANT TO BUILD AN EDUCATIONAL FACILITY USING HIGH QUALITY SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKERS FOR THOSE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. WEBSITE BUT THAT. THIS TO TURN MEMBERS CAITLIN VEGA FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALL SECURE AND STRONG SUPPORT. ONE OF THE GREATEST CHALLENGES WE FACE IN CALIFORNIA IS THE DISAPPEARING MIDDLE CLASS AND THE FACT THAT TOO MANY JOBS I LEAVE WORKERS STUCK IN POVERTY WHAT THIS BILL REALLY IS ABOUT IS THAT WHEN EVER WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY -- ESPECIALLY IN REGARDS TO A PUBLIC WORKS PROJECT TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES TO A GOOD CAREER TO GOOD JOBS TO STABILITY FOR FAMILIES WE SHOULD BE TAKING THOSE OPPORTUNITIES SO WHAT HERE INSTRUCTS THE PART OF THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU. ANYONE ALSO SUPPORT. NAME AFFILIATION POSITION. MIKE WESTWOOD DISTRICT COUNCIL SIXTEEN PAINTERS AND ALLIED TRADES IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. MATT BROUGHT FOR THE TEAMSTERS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. MATT CRIMMINS ON WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA THAT A CONFERENCE OF OPERATING ENGINEERS STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. THEY WERE IN OPPOSITION. OKAY OF ANY OTHER ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. WE DO HAVE A MOTION TO PASS TO A PROBES FROM OUR APPROACH SHARE SOME RUBIO SALAS SECONDED BY SOME RADIO. OF ANY CLOSING COMMENTS MISTER DONALD AS FOR NEVER. YEAH. I THANK YOU. MATT IS ACTUALLY CALLED -- PLEASE. MOTIONS YOU PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS KALRA. KALRA AYE FLORA PRIO DEEP HI THE BY AND SALAS GONZALEZ I JONES SAWYER. THREE OF US STILL SOME. ALL RIGHTS WILL PLACE THAT ON CALL [inaudible] SOMEONE GONZALEZ. ITEM THREE A LINE ITEM THREE A. B.. FIVE FIVE FIVE I NAY PROCEED MANY EVERY YEAR RIGHT HERE ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU -- MISTER CHAIR AND GOOD AFTERNOON. AB FIVE FIVE FIVE ALLOWS EMPLOYEES TO USE AT LEAST FIVE PAID SICK DAYS A YEAR WITHOUT FACING WEIGHT LOSS OR RETALIATION. FIVE YEARS AGO CALIFORNIA SET A NATIONAL STANDARD BY PROVIDING SIX POINT FIVE MILLION WORKERS WITH LONG OVERDUE PROTECTIONS OF THREE PAID SICK DAYS A YEAR. OTHER US STATES IN MAJOR CITIES FOLLOWED ALONG AND SOME AREAS IN IN METRO CALIFORNIAN FACT -- HAD HAD PRECEDED US BUT THESE AREAS ALL HAVE A HIGHER STANDARD CALIFORNIA -- CITY SUCH AS SAN FRANCISCO OAKLAND AND REBUILD BERKELEY LOS ANGELES AND SAN DIEGO A PASSER OWN ORDINANCES GRANNY WORKERS WITH EVEN GREATER PAID SICK LEAVE BENEFITS THE NATIONAL STANDARD. RANGES BETWEEN FIVE AND SEVEN DAYS BUT WORKERS WHO CAN'T BENEFIT FROM LOCAL ORDINANCES STILL DON'T HAVE SUFFICIENT PAID SICK LEAVE AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO REPORT GOING TO WORK WITH A CONTAGIOUS ILLNESS AND RISK INFECTING OTHERS. UNFORTUNATELY THIS HAPPENS OFTEN BECAUSE FOR WORKING FAMILIES STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET. EVEN IF YOU I'M PAID DAYS OFF COULD COST THEM THEIR ENTIRE MONTHLY BUDGET FOR GROCERIES. FLU RELATED HOSPITALIZATION AND MORTALITY RATES THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS HAVE BEEN UNPRECEDENTED THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION REPORTS OF PEOPLE WHO FELL ILL WITH THE FLU. NEEDED AT LEAST ONE WEEK TO RECOVER. IT'S HIGH TIME THAT WE STRENGTH IN THIS CRITICAL SAFETY NET STOPPING WORKING FAMILIES IN A POSITION WHERE THEY MUST CHOOSE BETWEEN SACRIFICING THEIR PAY IN COMING TO WORK SICK. IN ANTICIPATION OF A THE OPPOSITION'S ARGUMENTS I WILL REMIND FOLKS OF FIVE YEARS AGO THEY WARNED US THAT THIS WOULD BE A JOB KILLER THE JOBS WOULD OF COURSE FLEE FROM CALIFORNIA AS A RESULT. OF PROVIDING JUST THREE PAID SICK DAYS AND I'M SURE WE WILL HEAR THAT AGAIN TODAY PERHAPS NOT WITH A JOB KILLER TITLE BUT THE SAME THING. I WOULD VENTURE TO ASK THEM HOW MANY JOBS AND IMPACT -- HAVE HAVE BEEN LOST IN CALIFORNIA AS A RESULT OF PROVIDING PAID SICK DAYS IN FACT WE KNOW THAT -- THERE THERE HASN'T BEEN AT TO OUR KNOWLEDGE RECORDED LOSS OF A JOB AS A RESULT OF LIEU OF PROVIDING PAID SICK DAYS AND IN FACT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE FOLLOWED ALONG IN PROVIDED EVEN MORE. WE ARE ONE OF THE ONLY. FIRST WORLD COUNTRIES IF YOU WELL WHO DON'T RECOGNIZE INDIVIDUALS NEED TO TAKE TIME OFF WHEN THEY'RE SICK -- AND AS WE MOVE FORWARD THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THAT WOULD BE A STANDARD -- FOR THE ENTIRE STATE THAT MAKES SENSE I WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT IF YOU LIVE IN WORK IN A CITY LIKE SAN DIEGO YOU COULD LITERALLY -- WORK AT THE SAME ESTABLISHMENT PART TIME ACROSS CITY LINES HAVE A DIFFERENTIATION OF ANYWHERE BETWEEN -- TWO AND SEVEN DAYS OF OF SICK TIME SO THIS IT DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE -- YOU COULD BE WORKING FOR THE SAME COMPANY AND HAVE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BENEFITS AND IT'S TIME TO STANDARDIZE THOSE AND PUSH THEM UP JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE I RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR NINE THANK YOU. WITNESSES SUPPORT YES HELLO MY NAME IS JENNY CASSIDY I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA WORK AND FAMILY COALITION WERE STATEWIDE ALLIANCE. OF ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS AND WE'RE UNITED BEHIND -- WORKPLACE POLICIES THAT HELP CALIFORNIA FAMILIES THRIVE AND WE'RE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB. FIVE FIVE FIVE AND WE HAVE FOUND THE PAID SICK DAYS IS REALLY A VERY NO NONSENSE POLICY THAT REALLY DOES WONDERS TO HELP THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING IN THE ECONOMIC SECURITY OF OUR FAMILIES IN THE STATE. BUT FURTHERMORE IT'S ALSO THE NUMBER ONE THING THE CDC SAYS TO DO WHEN YOU HAVE A CONTAGIOUS -- SICKNESS THAT YOU NEED TO STAY HOME AND SO IT'S ALSO FOR US IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE FAMILIES IT'S ALSO REALLY ABOUT OUR COMMUNITIES. EVEN OUR BUSINESSES AND AND HOW WE THRIVE IN CALIFORNIA -- I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER GNZALEZ MENTIONED IS THAT YOU KNOW ALTHOUGH THE US IS QUITE ALONE IN BEING ONE OF THE FEW COUNTRIES THAT DOES NOT PROVIDE THIS AS A FEDERAL POLICY WE IN CALIFORNIA REALLY AREN'T ALONE IN THAT MORE AND MORE STATES. AND LOCALITIES ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY SOMETHING LIKE FORTY THREE PAID SICK DAYS LAWS OF VARIOUS SIZES BUT MOST ARE FIVE AND MORE AND SO IT REALLY IS TIME TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND THIS -- Là A LITTLE BIT FURTHER AND ALSO JUST TO KIND OF HI LATE A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ SAID. IT'S REALLY -- IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE JUST SEEING SO MANY FAMILIES STRUGGLING THAT EVEN JUST LOSING ONE TO TWO DAYS TO PAY WE'RE SEEING IN OUR COALITION MORE AND MORE PEOPLE. HAVING SOMETHING LIKE SOME YOU KNOW ECONOMIC THINGS THAT SEEM KIND OF SMALL REALLY IMPACTING THE ABILITY TO PAY RENT THE ABILITY TO BUY GROCERIES. SO THIS REALLY DOES HAVE TO BE EXTENDED RIGHT NOW PEOPLE CAN TAKE THREE BUT LIKE MY KIDS GOT REALLY SICK WITH THE FLU LAST YEAR AND THEY DID NEED A WEEK TO RECOVER. SO YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE FINDING IS THAT. WHEN IT COMES TO KIDS IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE THEIR PARENTS NEARBY? I'M NOT JUST FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING FOR YOUR KIDS GIVING THE MEDICINE ETCETERA BUT STUDIES SHOW THAT THAT PSYCHOLOGICAL COMFORT AND CARE OF HAVING SOMEBODY CARE FOR YOU WHEN YOU'RE SICK ESPECIALLY A CHILD AND HAVING THEIR PARENT THERE. IS REALLY KEY TO THEM GETTING BETTER SO I FEEL LIKE THIS IS JUST A VERY HUMANE GOOD THING THAT WE NEED TO DO IN CALIFORNIA. AND I'M VERY -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HEARING MY TESTIMONY AND I'M -- JUST I ALSO REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SO MUCH ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRDS OF THE COMMITTEE JESSICA BARTOLO WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WE'RE THRILLED FOR THIS AND THIS LEGISLATION AND URGE ARRIVAL THANK YOU THANK YOU.

HI GOOD AFTERNOON MARC CURTIS HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY WE ARE HERE IN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION. ON AB FIVE FIVE FIVE WE DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE LOCAL ORDINANCE ISSUE AND PRE EMPTING MOST PROVISIONS OF THE LAW. PART OF THE AMENDMENTS WERE REQUESTING IS THAT IT BE ACROSS THE BOARD PREEMPTION -- I DO UNDERSTAND THE AUTHOR'S INTENT OF ALLOWING ADDITIONAL DAYS OF SICK LEAVE HOWEVER FOR EMPLOYERS -- OVER THERE ALREADY TRYING TO STRUGGLE WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT LOCAL ORDINANCES DIFFERENT WAGE RATES FOR DIFFERENT ORDINANCES AND ACROSS THE BOARD PREEMPTION IS SOMETHING THAT WE THINK WOULD ESPECIALLY HELP -- EMPLOYERS IN THE SITUATION ADDITIONALLY WE ARE ASKING THAT -- THE RATE OF PAY BE BASED ON THE BASE RATE AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS IS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE WITH REGARD TO A EMPLOYEES TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PAID SICK LEAVE. ON HOLIDAYS SO WHEN THEY'RE GETTING THEIR HIGHER RATE OF PAY AND ADDITIONALLY AT THE WHEN THEY'RE AT THE END OF HARVEST AND THINGS LIKE THAT WHEN THEY ARE AT A HIGHER RATE OF PAY BECAUSE THEY ALL CALL IN SICK AT THE SAME TIME. BECAUSE THEY'LL MAKE MORE MONEY ON THOSE DAYS THAN IF THEY CALLED IN SICK HONORED ON A REGULAR WORK DAY ADDITIONALLY AND THERE'S DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION IN THE BILL FOR I. H. S. S. WORKERS. ARE OF THE INDUSTRY AND WE FEEL THAT IF THERE'S DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION FOR ONE INDUSTRY AGAIN IT SHOULD BE APPLICABLE ACROSS THE BOARD. AND LASTLY -- VERIFICATION AGAIN THIS IS TO HELP ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE ABUSE OF THE SICK LEAVE LAW AND AND IN SAN DIEGO YOU'RE ALLOWED VERIFICATION AFTER THREE CONSECUTIVE DAYS OF SICKLY. FOR THE LAST TWO FOR THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAY AND THE EMPLOYER IS A LOT TO ASK FOR A DOCTOR'S NOTE IF YOU TAKE FIVE CONSECUTIVE FORTY FIVES TWO CONSECUTIVE DAYS WERE ASKING FOR THAT AS WELL. SO FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE IN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR CHRISTOPHER KAYLEE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA BUILDS ASSOCIATION MY COLLEAGUES AT THE FORESTRY ASSOCIATION. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN I ACTUALLY HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING WITH THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN HONOR A BE FIFTEEN TWENTY TWO AND SHORTLY AFTER IT WAS SIGNED SHE ACTUALLY CAME. IN SAN DIEGO AND SPOKE AT OUR ANNUAL CONVENTION -- ABOUT THAT NEW BILL SO WE HAD A LOT OF HISTORY ON THIS MEASURE I JUST WANTED TO ADD TO TO CONCERNS IN ADDITION TO THOSE ENUMERATED BY MISS CURTIS WHICH IS. THERE IS COST US PARTICULARLY FOR THE SMALL BUSINESS SMALL EMPLOYER IN THE STATE. AND YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT IN A BROADER CONTEXT. IN THAT WE HAVE THE HIGHEST BASED SALES TAX RATE THE HIGHEST PERSONAL INCOME TAX RATES. THE HIGHEST ENERGY IN WORKERS COMP COSTS ANA AMONGST THE WESTERN STATES IT CETERA. THE OTHER THING IS WE ARE A VERY FAMILY FRIENDLY -- IT LEAVE THE STATE -- THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF STATE LEGISLATURES HAS OFTEN RAIN CALIFORNIA M<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; AMONGST&lt;/c&gt;</u> THE MOST FAMILY FRIENDLY FOR ALL THOSE PROTECTED LEAVES SO. IN PARTICULARLY THE AMENDMENTS THAT -- MISS CURTIS AS OUTLINED IS WHAT OUR ORGANIZATIONS DESIRE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. THE CALL RISE CALIFORNIA MANY FACTORS IN TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION I JUST WANT TO KNOW ONE CORRECTION FROM THE ANALYSIS WE ARE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED NOT OPPOSED TO THE BILL -- AND WE ARE HAVE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED BECAUSE WE ARE WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE. TO DEAL WITH -- SOME CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE SEEING IN OUR INDUSTRY RELATED TO THE MISUSE OF THE PAID SICK LEAVE BENEFIT WE WANT TO PRESERVE IT FOR THAT -- INTENDED PURPOSE OF THAT BENEFIT AND IF I CAN JUST OFFER AN EXAMPLE AND RELATED TO THE MINIMUM INCREMENTS THAT THE PAID SICK LEAVE CAN BE USED WE HAVE COMPANIES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AS YOU KNOW TRAFFIC IS HORRIBLE THERE. FOR MANUFACTURERS WHO HAS AN ATTENDANCE POLICY THEY'RE SEEING THEIR STAFF INVOKE THE PAID SICK LEAVE BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THEY'RE COMING AND GOING TO BE COMING IN TO WORK LATE AND THEY DON'T WANT THEIR ATTENDANCE. RECORD HIT SO IS THOSE TYPES OF INSTANCES THAT WE'D LIKE -- TO SEE FIX WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND WE ARE. BUT AT THIS POINT WE ARE UNFORTUNATELY OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED THANK YOU OKAY I WILL TREAT YOU AS THE THIRD EXPERT WITNESSES IS FALLS UNDER THE SIX MINUTES. OR ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. GETTING AND SOME OF THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION REPOSE THANK YOU. MORE IS REGISTERED WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION AND WE ARE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT -- NO ONE ELSE OPPOSITION WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. IS THERE A MOTION ON THIS. I'LL SECOND THAT. YES I HAVE A QUESTION. PLEASE. MA'AM I IN IN READING THIS BILL -- I COMPLETELY SUPPORT THE THE THE THE IDEA OF GIVING A SICK LEAVE TO WORKERS -- AND AND I DO UNDERSTAND THAT -- S AS AN EMPLOYEE IF IF YOU AND I HAVE A COMMON COLD OR EVEN IF WE HAVE. A MINOR FLU WE CAN JUST TAKE OFF THREE OR FOUR DAYS AND GO TO CVS AND BY SOME PLUMAS IN IN IN IN BE OKAY WITH IT BUT YOU ARE YOU NOT OPEN TO REQUIRING THAT -- ON THE LEASE ON THE FIFTH DAY THAT. IF IF WE DO GO THROUGH IT WE REALLY THAT SICK -- SHOULD WE AT LEAST. GET A DOCTOR'S NOTE. SO -- YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF DISPUTE ABOUT THAT FIRST OF ALL WHAT WE HAVE FOUND IS MOST PEOPLE DON'T USE FIVE CONSECUTIVE DAYS I MEAN THERE MIGHT BE A THEY THEY TEND TO USE A DAY -- AND SO IF IT WAS ON THE FIFTH DAY I GUESS IF YOU'RE SICK FOR A DAY THEN IT'S THE FIFTH DAY. SECOND WITH THAT IS THE REALITY THAT -- A LOT OF WORKERS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO A DOCTOR. AND THAT IS UNFORTUNATELY THE TRUTH AND WE STILL SUFFER FROM THAT IN THIS STATE AND SO -- OR THE COST OF OF GOING TO THE DOCTORS SO HIGH ESPECIALLY FOR LOW WAGE WORKERS -- WHO DON'T HAVE THAT ACCESS? WE STILL HAVE IN THIS IN THIS STATE UNINSURABLE FOLKS AND SO WE'RE ASKING PEOPLE TO ADD AN ADDITIONAL COST ON TO SOMETHING THAT LET'S BE HONEST IT'S EARNED SICK TIME IT'S NOT GIVEN TO AN EMPLOYEE IT'S EARNED THROUGHOUT THEIR YEAR OF SERVICE -- AND SO YOU KNOW IT IN AND RECOGNIZING ALL OF THAT -- WE DON'T FEEL THAT IT IS APPROPRIATE -- TO TO BE ASKING WORKERS WHO CAN BE ALL DIFFERENT SITUATIONS FOR YOUR EYE ON THE FIFTH DAY IT'S PROBABLY EVER BEFORE OUT FIVE DAYS WOULD PROBABLY. SPEND THE FIFTY DOLLAR COPAY TO GO TO THE DOCTOR AND AND WE COULD GET AN OUT -- BUT WE'RE IN A MUCH BETTER SITUATION AND AND AND THE TRUTH IS WE WOULD NEVER BE EXPECTED. TO THERE'S ALSO SOME PRIVACY CONCERNS WITH THAT -- IN IN THE FACT THAT WE DON'T NECESSARILY -- WANT TO FORCE WORKERS TO TELL THEIR EMPLOYER WHAT EXACT SICKNESS THEY HAVE OR WHAT DOCTOR THEIR SCENE. I'M AND FINALLY I'D SAY THE IMPETUS FOR ME WRITING THIS BILL IN THE FIRST PLACE IT'S KIND OF INTERESTING BECAUSE WE TALK A LOT ABOUT SICK DAYS NOW IN THE FLU -- REALLY IN THAT OUR OUR WORKERS THAT WE HAD HERE BEFORE WERE THE REASON I I A BROKE THE SPELL WHEN I WAS A UNION LEADER AND ORGANIZER -- TALKING TO TWO NEW WORKERS WHO HAD BEEN UNIONIZE WOULD ASK THEM LIKE HOW YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE GREATEST THING ABOUT HAVING A UNION AND YOU THINK IT BE LIKE THEY'RE GETTING A PAY INCREASE OR THEY'RETHEY'RE GETTING -- HEALTH CARE WAGES AND TIME AND TIME AGAIN WE HEAR STORIES ESPECIALLY FROM SINGLE MOMS LIKE. IF MY SON'S SCHOOL CALLS IN HE SAID I CAN GO PICK HIM UP AND I'M NOT GONNA LOSE MY JOB. YOU KNOW I A IF I'M STATE I CAN STAY HOME WITH MY KIDS WHEN THEY'RE SICK. SO THE IMPETUS ME WRITING THIS BILL IN THE FIRST PLACE HAD TO DO. MUCH MORE SO -- YOU KNOW I I'D NEVER TAKEN A SICK DAY IN MY LIFE. BUT I HAD TAKEN OFF WORK TO GO GET MY KIDS BECAUSE I WAS. AND JULIE SENDING THEM TO SCHOOL WITH A FEVER -- AND YOU GET CAUGHT I MEAN THAT'S WHAT CAN'T WORKING PARENTS TEND TO DO -- OR THEY THROW UP AT SCHOOL YOU HAVE TO GET THEM RIGHT AND SO IT'S NOT A SITUATION BY WHICH YOU COULD HAVE MULTIPLE KIDS AND AND THEY COULD HAVE A COMMON COLD. AND SO ONE KID SEC ONE DAY TWO DAYS THREE DAYS AND THEN THE NEXT KID GET SECOND YOUR HOME FIVE DAYS AND YOU'VE NEVER GONE TO THE DOCTOR AND IT'S NOT UNREASONABLE. AND SO I JUST THINK THAT THOSE ALL THOS EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES I FIND IT UNFORTUNATE -- THAT WE DON'T TRUST OUR OWN WORK FORCE TO TELL US THE TRUTH. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST DISTURBING THINGS ABOUT THESE CONVERSATIONS WERE HAVING IS THAT WE DON'T PUT THAT TRUST IN OUR WORKERS THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO MAKE. OUR OUR WHATEVER WORK WE DO IF IT AS BOSSES IF YOU WILL -- WERE SUPERVISORS THEY'RE THE ONES WHO ARE ACTUALLY PERFORMING THE WORK TO MAKE A SUCCESSFUL AND PROFITABLE AND YET WE DON'T. TRUST IF THEY SAY THEY'RE SICK OR THEIR LOVED ONE TO STICK OR THEY NEED TO STAY HOME -- THERE'S ALSO A A AN OPPORTUNITY FOR FOR ON MENTAL HEALTH REASONS TO STAY HOME THAT'S ALSO YOU CAN BE SICK ON STRESS. AND SO THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT ASPECTS TO IT TO WHITE PEOPLE NEED SOMETIMES A DAY OFF OR TWO DAYS OFF AND WE THINK UP TO FIVE DAYS OFF IS REASONABLE -- THAT WE JUST DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO HAVE THEM EXPLAIN THAT WE ARE PRESENT AB PANTENE THE SAN DIEGO ORDINANCE THAT REQUIRES A FOURTH AND FIFTH DAY TO HAVE. A NO WE TRIED VERY HARD TO WORK WITH OUR WITH COMPANIES -- THAT THAT OPERATE MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS TO HAVE ONE SET OF RULES I WAS NOTICING MY DAUGHTER WAS WAITRESSING AND SAN DIEGO AND HER HER AT SIXTY OF CRUEL ON HER PAYCHECK. IS I MEAN IT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE WORKER IT'S CONFUSING BECAUSE THEY HAVE STATE AND CITY LAWS THAT THAT READ DIFFERENTLY -- AND SO WE DID WORK THROUGH A LOT OF PRE EMPTION ISSUES AND WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA PREAMP THAT AS WELL. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANKS. FOR CONTINUING -- THIS -- FIGHT AS WELL FOR THE FOR THE WORKERS AND AGAIN I THINK HAVING MORE SICK DAYS IS GOOD NOT JUST FOR THE WORKERS BEFORE THE EMPLOYERS. YOU DON'T ACTUALLY WANT YOUR WORK OR YOUR EMPLOYEE THERE WHEN THEY'RE SICK GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES AND THEIR LOVED ONES AGAIN WILL MAKE FOR A SAFER WORK ENVIRONMENTS. HAPPIER EMPLOYEES AND I AND I THINK -- BUT WILL WILL MOVE US AS A STATE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION EVEN THOUGH I THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE WE CAN DO TO PROTECT WORKERS AND WITH THAT -- WE DO HAVE A MOTION I WAS AT CLOSING COMMENTS JUST A COUPLE OF THE THINGS THAT WERE BROUGHT A PORN ASKED ABOUT -- HOLIDAY PAY I I THINK MOST OF US NOW BECAUSE I'VE HEARD THAT BILL MULTIPLE TIMES AND HAD DEFEATED -- THAT HOLIDAY BEHAVE IN CALIFORNIA IS NOT A RIGHT AND IN FACT MOST PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY BENEFIT FROM HOLIDAY PAY OUR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES SO I WOULD LOVE TO TALK TO THE BUSINESSES THAT SUGGESTS THAT THEIR NUMBER OF PEOPLE TAKING HOLIDAYS OFF BECAUSE THEY GET PAID MORE -- IN THOSE SITUATIONS I WOULD SUGGEST. I KNOW THERE'S A COUPLE OF RETAILERS THE PAY ON TIME AND A HALF OR GIVE AN EXTRA TURKEY ON THANKSGIVING -- AND THAT PERHAPS THEY CAN NOT SCHEDULE THEIR WORKERS ON THANKSGIVING AND THAT WOULD SOLVE THAT PROBLEM AND THE OTHER ISSUE THAT WE HEARD IS THAT. YOU KNOW WELL I JUST I I DO I DO WANT TO POINT OUT -- AT THE CHAMBER MISS CARSON GENERAL IN AND I I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER YOU KNOW IF IF WE DIDN'T. WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IT REMINDED ME WHEN SHE WALKED UP. THAT SO MANY WORKERS DON'T HAVE -- EVEN PAID LEAVE FOR HAVING A BABY. N. AND HONESTLY -- THE THE LAWS THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA DEPEND ON THE COMPANY SIZE THEY DID THEY DEPEND -- ON ON ON THE PORTIONS OF THAT SO THERE ARE LITERALLY WOMEN WHO HAVE TO GO BACK TO WORK THE DAY AFTER THEY GIVE BIRTH. IN CAN YOU IMAGINE BEING IN THAT SITUATION WE SAID WHEN WE PASS PAID SICK DAYS THE FIRST TIME AT LEAST WE KNEW THAT THEY COULD BE ACCESS THREE DAYS ALSO PAID FAMILY LEAVE WHEN IT DOES KICK IN. KICKS IN AFTER THE FIRST WEEK SO WE'RE TRYING -- TO CROSSED THAT DIFFERENTIAL IS WELL IN MAKE SURE -- THAT THAT ALL WOMEN -- WHO HAVE EIGHT CHILDBEARING? I GUESS YOU COULD CALL IT HEALTH CONDITION -- ALSO HAVE I MEAN COME ON FIVE FULL DAYS TO RECOUP AND GET BACK TO WORK SOUTH WHICH IS FAR TOO LITTLE I'M JUST SAYING IT'S IT'S THE ULTIMATE SAFETY NET SO. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NINE ABOUT THE MIS KERR IS GOING TO MISS YOU WHEN SHE'S ON RELIEF. I THINK YOU CAN COME ON BACK AND BE A UNION ORGANIZER. OH OKAY WAS A WITH THAT WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE TABLE WHICH IS A DO PASSED TO A I DO PASS AS AMENDED APPROPRIATIONS -- SECTOR CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. KALRA. I'VE KALRA AYE FLORA CARILLO.

AND FORMALLY INCARCERATED COMMUNITIES WITH OUR STATE FACING RISING INEQUALITY IN COST OF LIVING COMBINED WITH THE PROJECTED SHORTAGE OF ONE POINT FIVE MILLION WORKERS WITH THE POST SECONDARY EDUCATION. IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT CALIFORNIA INVESTMENTS ENTIRE WORK FORCE WITH INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS THAT FULLY INCLUDE OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. HOWEVER AS WE OUTLINED IN OUR MOST RECENT REPORT MULTIPLE AND SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS ARE SHUTTING OUR COMMUNITIES OUT OF MEANINGFUL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES WHICH MEANS SHUTTING THEM OUT FROM ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AND MOMENT MOBILITY. AND AS YOU JUST HEARD I IMMIGRANTS REFUGEES AND PEOPLE WITH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY LIKE ACCESS TO LINGUISTICALLY AND CULTURALLY COMPETENT STAFF PROGRAM AND SERVICES. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FORMALLY INCARCERATED MANY OF WHOM WORK OR RECEIVE TRAINING WHILE INCARCERATED ARE UNABLE TO APPLY THEIR EXPERIENCES. TO CREDENTIALS AND CAREERS UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS ARE IN ELIGIBLE FOR THE MAJORITY OF WORK FOR SERVICES EVEN THOUGH THEY COMPRISE ONE OUT OF TEN WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA. SO MANY BERRIES NETWORK FOR SYSTEM CUT ACROSS OUR COMMUNITIES SUCH AS TIME AND COST REQUIRED FOR TRAINING A LACK OF SUPPORT OF STAFF AND SERVICES AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY.

ONE AND AS I INDICATED PREVIOUSLY UP YOU WITNESSES ARE UP TO FOR SIX MINUTES WON'T SPEND ALL TIME. A DOCTOR OF COURSE YOU MAY OPEN. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT TO YOU AB SIXTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN THE PROTECT AMERICA CALL TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA CALL CENTER JOB AT CALL CENTERS ARE MAJOR ECONOMIC FORCE IN THE UNITED STATES REPRESENTING ABOUT 3% OF OUR WORKFORCE. YET THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMER SERVICE CONTACT CENTER JOBS HAS DECLINED IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS BY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND LARGELY DUE TO OUTSOURCING AND LAYOFFS. IS BECOME ALL TOO COMMON FOR CORPORATIONS TO REAP THE BENEFITS OF STATE FUNDING IN SUBSIDIES WHILE AT THE SAME TIME EXPORTING JOBS OVERSEAS. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS CORPORATIONS HAVE BENEFITTED FROM MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN STATE SUBSIDIES WERE FUNNELING CALL CENTER JOBS OUT OF CALIFORNIA. SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THE SHUT DOWN OF JUST FIVE CALL SOON AS RESULTED IN NEARLY A THOUSAND MIDDLE CLASS JOBS LOST. CORPORATION SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS OUTSOURCING AND TO CONTINUE SUBSIDIZING CORPORATIONS THAT EXPORT CALL CENTER JOBS ONLY SERVES TO INCENTIVIZE BEHAVIOR. BECAUSE OF THE JOB SHOULD BE BASED IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY SERVE. AB SIXTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN WOULD REQUIRE THAT EMPLOYERS SEEKING TO RELOCATE CALL CENTERS FROM CALIFORNIA TO ANOTHER COUNTRY GIVE THE LABOR COMMISSIONER OF HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS NOTICE. ADDITIONALLY IN ADDITION EMPLOYERS WHO EXPORT CALL CENTER JOBS OVERSEAS WOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM RECEIVING ANY STATE GRANTS GUARANTEED LOANS OR TAX BENEFITS FOR FIVE YEARS. THIS BILL IS SPONSORED BY THE COMMUNICATION WORKERS OF AMERICA AND HERE TO SPEAK WITH ME TODAY IS TOM RUNYON WHO'S VICE PRESIDENT FOR ME. COMMUNICATION WORKERS OF AMERICA DISTRICT. NINE IN A MOTION A SECOND PLEASE -- MY NAME IS TOM RUNYON I'M VICE PRESIDENT OF COMMUNICATION WORKERS OF AMERICA DISTRICT. NINE AND I'M HERE TODAY SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF AB. SIXTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN AND I WANT TO THANK YOU CHAIRMAN COLOR AND THE MEMBERS FOR LETTING US -- TESTIFYING. CALL CENTERS ARE AN IMPORTANT ECONOMIC LIFELINE FOR MANY COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WITH TWO HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY WORKERS WITH THE JOB TITLE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE IN CALIFORNIA ALONE. BUT THOUSANDS OF CALL CENTER WORKERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS IN RECENT YEARS AS MAJOR CORPORATIONS HAVE OFF SHORT CUSTOMER SERVICE OPERATIONS. OVERSEAS. SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN FOR EXAMPLE EIGHTEEN T. HAS CLOSE CALL CENTERS IN ANAHEIM. BAKERSFIELD ATWATER SACRAMENTO OAKLAND RESULTING IN OVER A THOUSAND LOST JOBS. EIGHTEEN T. HAS ALSO SET FAIRLY REDUCE ITS WORKFORCE IN SAN RAMON FRESNO SAN DIEGO COMMERCE PASADENA ESCONDIDO AND TORRANCE. IN MAY OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SPECTRUM FORMALLY TIME WARNER CABLE CLOSED ITS CALL CENTER IN PALM DESERT LAYING OFF TWO HUNDRED WORKERS. IN FEBRUARY OF TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN VERIZON WIRELESS CLOSE ITS CALL CENTER IN IRVINE. THEN I'M PULLING OVER ONE THOUSAND WORKERS. IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE COMPANY CLOSED ITS CALL CENTER IN RANCHO CORDOVA ALSO LAYING OFF OVER ONE THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. THIS TREND IS HARMED WORKING FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS AMERICA. WHILE ENDANGERING CONSUMER SECURITY FOR EXAMPLE. CALL CENTERS IN COSTA RICO WERE HOME TO A MASSIVE TELEMARKETING SCAMS THAT THE FRAUD AT THOUSANDS OF U. S. CITIZENS. MOST OVER THE AGE OF FIFTY FIVE OF UPWARDS OF TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. WITH NEW TAX PROVISIONS IN THE TRUMP TAX BILL COMPANIES ARE EVEN MORE LIKELY TO MOVE THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE WORK OVERSEAS. ACCORDING TO JOINT COMMITTEE ON TAXATION THE NEW TERRITORIAL TAX SYSTEM EXEMPTS OFFSHORE INCOME FROM US TAXATION COSTING TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN BILLION OVER THE NEXT DECADE. AND IT WILL CREATE A TAX INCENTIVE FOR CORPORATION TO MOVE JOBS OFFSHORE TO COUNTRIES WITH LOWER TAX RATES. COMPANIES ARE ALREADY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS PROVISIONS AFTER THE FEDERAL TAX BILL PASSED EIGHTEEN T. A COMPANY THAT MEDI. TWENTY BILLION FROM THE TAX SAVINGS HAS ELIMINATED OVER TEN THOUSAND CALL CENTER JOBS IN THE US. WE NEED NEW EFFORTS THAT PUT CALIFORNIA WORKERS FIRST ADD NEW LEVELS OF ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE OFF SHORING PROCESS AND ENSURE THAT WE ARE NOT REWARDING COMPANIES WHO ARE ACTIVELY ELIMINATING. GOOD JOBS IN OUR STATE. AB SIXTY SEVENTY SEVEN IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE JOB STAY IN CALIFORNIA AND PROTECT CONSUMERS ALL IT DOES IS PROVIDE NOTICE OF A COMPANY OFF SHORES OF ITS CALL CENTER WORK AND LIMITS ELIGIBILITY FOR STATE TAX CREDITS AND SUBSIDIES SUBSIDIES FOR FIVE YEARS. I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER SHIRLEY WEBER FOR HER LEADERSHIP IN INTERDICTION OF THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION AND I URGE ALL LEGISLATORS TO SUPPORT AB SIXTY SEVEN SEVEN THANK YOU.

SIXTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN CALIFORNIA IS A COFFEE PLACE TO DO BUSINESS AND A LOT OF OFTENTIMES THESE CALL CENTERS ARE OPENED AND THEN THE COST OF BUSINESS -- MAKES AN BUSINESSES WANT TO RELOCATE AND INSTEAD OF ALLEVIATING SOME OF THESE BURDENSOME REGULATIONS. AB SIXTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN SIX TO PENALIZE COMPANIES ANOMALY THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL OF A PUBLIC SHAMING ASPECT AS WELL AND WE DON'T THINK THE PUBLIC SHAMING AS EVER THE A SOLUTION TO THESE TYPES OF PROBLEMS. AND AND ADDITIONALLY -- THERE'S GOING TO BE PENALTIES TENTH A POTENTIALLY A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR PENALTY OR THE PENALTIES PROVIDED THROUGH THE PRIVATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ACTIVE EMPLOYEES WERE TO TAKE. THESE PROVISIONS TO COURT -- ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE ACTUALLY -- SOMEONE REACH OUT TO ME THIS WEEK WHO WAS A BUSINESS LOOKING TO OPEN A CALL CENTER IN CALIFORNIA HAS HEARD ABOUT THIS BILL AND HAS DECIDED TO HOLD OFF.

CHEAPER TO TAKE YOUR JOB OVERSEAS AND TO REALLY PAY THE PEOPLE WHO WORK HERE AND EVERY DAY MAKE CALIFORNIA'S LIFE OF WHAT IT IS SO IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT WE SUPPORT A CALL CENTER WORKERS.

THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT SEEN NINE ANY OPPOSITION. MAY HAVE TO MAKE ROOM FOR ONE PLEASE GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MAY DELAY WITH THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COUNCIL -- WE'RE HAVING OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL AND I'LL START OFF BY SAYING THAT WE DON'T DISAGREE WITH THAT THE CONCEPT BEHIND THE BILL -- SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT THE AUTHOR MENTIONED -- IN A STATEMENT AROUND IN THE SALON WORKERS IN ABILITY TO ACCESS SOME OF THESE SAFETY DATA SHEETS IS TROUBLING TO US. MANUFACTURERS MAKE SAFETY DATA SHEETS FOR OUR PROFESSIONAL COSMETICS AND THEY SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE TO WORKERS AND WE BELIEVE THAT. IF THE SALONS ARE NOT PROVIDING THOSE MSTS IS TO THEIR WORKERS ARE ACTUALLY IN VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW. SO WE DON'T OPPOSE -- THE ACCESSIBILITY OF OF THE SAFETY DATA SHEETS OR THE LANGUAGE ACCESS NECESSARILY -- SO FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE I DON'T FEEL LIKE WE'RE THAT FAR APART BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY AGREE -- SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE LIKE TO WORK THROUGH WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE ARE AROUND CLARIFYING THE SCOPE OF WHAT. PRODUCTS ARE GONNA BE REQUIRED OF FOR SAFETY DATA SHEETS TO BE MADE AVAILABLE -- WE WORKED WITH THE AUTHOR OF LAST YEAR ON HIS PROFESSIONAL COSMETICS INGREDIENT DISCLOSURE BILL LAST YEAR AND I THINK BASED ON THE COMMENTS THAT YOU MADE. THAT IS THE UNIVERSE OF PRODUCTS HOPEFULLY THAT YOU GUYS ARE TARGETING SO WE'D APPRECIATE SOME CLARIFICATION THERE THAT YOU ARE IN FACT. REQUIRING PROFESSIONAL COSMETIC MSTS IS TO BE MADE AVAILABLE. AND THEN SECOND ONLY AND THE LANGUAGE THAT -- IS AROUND. GOSH. THE DIFFERENT DIES IN COLORS I BELIEVE IT IS IN THE BILL THAT SAYS THAT I MUST YES IT'S HAVE TO BE MADE AVAILABLE WE JUST WANT SOME CLARIFICATION. BASED ON THE LAST HEARING AND YES TM -- I BELIEVE THAT THE AUTHOR OR THE SPONSOR BOTH CLARIFIED THAT THE INTENTION IS NOT TO REQUIRE MANUFACTURERS TO DO ANYTHING NEW IF THEY MAKE AN MSTS FOR DIFFERENT COLOR DIED WE'D LIKE TO MAKE THIS AVAILABLE. I THINK WE'RE AGREEABLE TO THAT BUT I THINK THE LANGUAGE KINDA MISSES THE MARK SO JUST SOME THINGS THAT WE LIKE TO WORK ON BUT WERE IN OPPOSING THE CEMENT A POSITION CURRENTLY. GOOD AFTERNOON CALL COMMUTERS ON BEHALF OF THE HOUSEHOLD AND COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION AGAIN WE ALSO HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION IN PARTICULAR WITH THE INCLUSION OF DISINFECTANT PRODUCTS. WE JUST WOULD LIKE THE DEFINITION OF DISINFECTANT TO BE CLEAR WHAT WOULD BE IN SCOPE AND OUT OF SCOPE CURRENTLY OBVIOUSLY DISINFECTANTS ARE USED IN A VARIETY OF PLACES FOR A VARIETY OF PURPOSES AND WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE REALLY CLEAR THAT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- DISINFECTANTS USED IN SALONS AND SALON TOOLS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. SHARE MEMBERS CONGESTED WITH AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL ALSO OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED ASSOCIATE MY COMMENTS -- OVER THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS THANK YOU. THE CALL RISE CALIFORNIA FACTORS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION ALSO POSE LISTEN AND THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE OPPOSITION CNN ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THE DEEP YES THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR -- ICE HAVE A OF QUESTION FOR THE FOR THE AUTHOR IS THAT -- THIS BILL ONLY REQUIRE THAT THE THE MANUFACTURER. LIST THE CHEMICAL ON ON THE WEBSITE MAKE IT -- IN TRANSLATE INTO CERTAIN LANGUAGES BUT YOU HAVE NO INTENTION OF OF REQUIRING THAT THE THESE. THIS INFORMATION GET POSTED AT THEIR PLACE OF WORK WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW I MEAN YOU. BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE A LOT OF A LOT OF NAIL SALON WORKERS ON THE THEY WORK IN IN THIS ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY HAVE TO INHALE OR BREEZES. TOXIC CHEMICAL -- EIGHT NINE HOURS A DAY AND AND I DON'T THINK YOU LIKE HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT MAKING IT. MAKING IT TO THE MANDATE THAT. WILL BE POSTED NEXT TO THE MINIMUM WAGE POSTER. I BET IT AS THE THE THE THE WHOLE INTENT OF LIKE NOTIFYING WORKERS AT THE AND I ACTUALLY APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS AS INDICATED BY. A MISLI -- BUT SHE CORRECTLY STATED THAT THERE ALREADY IS A REQUIREMENT. OF PERSONAL LINES TO MAKE THE MSTS IS AVAILABLE -- TO BUT THEIR WORKERS AND SO IF THEY'RE NOT DOING THAT IN A WAY THAT SUCCESSFUL THAT'S ALREADY A PROBLEM AS TO WHERE THE IS THERE IS IT UP. WE DON'T WE'RE NOT SO PRESCRIPTIVE AS TO EXACTLY WHERE IT HAS TO BE WHAT HAVE YOU BUT AND DE IT. IS ALREADY REQUIRED BY LAW TO BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE WORKERS AND SO I'M OPEN TO ANY SUGGESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE AS TO HOW WE CAN DO THAT IN A DIFFERENT WAY THIS IS REALLY. ABOUT LANGUAGE ACCESS AS WELL AS ONLINE ACCESS WHICH YOU KNOW IS IS A MORE MORE COMMON WAY FOR FOLKS TO GET THE INFORMATION COULD IN THE WORKERS. AND BUT IN TERMS OF EXACTLY WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE POSTED THE REALITIES RIGHT NOW I THINK THERE IS. A THE REALITIES OF THE VIEW GOING TO A LOT US LINES THEY PROBABLY DON'T EVEN OF MANY THAT MAY NOT EVEN KNOW WHERE THOSE MSTS AS IS OUR AND SO THAT IS A SEPARATE ISSUE THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT. BY LAW THE BUT THERE THAT THEY'RE FALLING THROUGHOUT THE REQUIRED TO DO AND SO YOUR POINT IS VERY WELL TAKEN IN THAT REGARD. THE VERY MUCH ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEE ANOTHER STRUCTURE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THE THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I JUST WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR LIVE I REALLY DO. APPRECIATE OPPOSITION THEY'VE BEEN COMPLETELY ENGAGED IN TERMS OF WORKING WITH US EVERY STEP OF THE WAY BE. WE COMMIT TO CONTINUE TO KEEP THE DIALOGUE OPEN.

CONSUMERS ARE DEMANDING MORE FRESH PREPARED MEALS FRESH LOCAL FRUIT AND PRODUCE AND ARE CUTTING PROCESS WAS FROM THEIR DIETS. THE GROCERY INDUSTRY IS RESPONDING TO THESE CONSUMERS DEMAND BY INCREASING IN STORE FOOD PRODUCTION ADDING MORE LOCAL PRODUCE ADDING DIED IN OPTIONS AND SWAPPING THE CENTER AISLE WITH A FRESH PREPARED. GOODS IT IS THE PERIMETER OF THE GROCERY STORE THAT CONTINUES TO ATTRACT CONSUMERS SEEKING FRESH AND HEALTHY FOOD OPTIONS WHILE THESE CHANGES HAVE BEEN BENEFITS FOR CONSUMERS AND GROCERY STORES. IT IS NECESSARY TO WORKERS IN THE PRIMER TO THE STORE TO RECEIVE THE ADDITIONAL TRAINING OR EDUCATION TO KEEP UP WITH THESE CHANGES.

CREO I DEEP BY DEEP I GONZALEZ. GONZALEZ I JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER I THREE OF US THREE OF US HI. SURE. SCHEDULE SIR BILLS OUT. THANK YOU VICE CHAIR. ALL RIGHT. UP THE FINAL TWO BILLS ARE FROM A SIMILAR CARILLO. SB. SIX SEVEN THREE AGAIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I AM SUPPOSED TO BE AT TWO PLACES AT THE SAME TIME RIGHT NOW. THERE IN JUNE. HELLO AND PLEASE. AT SIX SEVEN THREE YEAH OKAY GREAT [inaudible] HELLO. THANK YOU. I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB SIX SEVEN THREE WILL KEEP IT SHORT -- A BILL THAT WILL BE AT THAT IS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RECOURSE TO WORKERS. AND THEIR EMPLOYERS TO NOT PAID WAGES ON TIME I WILL BE TAKING AMENDMENTS TO SPECIFY THAT ANY PENALTIES WERE COVERED BY THE LABOR COMMISSIONER SHALL BE PAID TO THE EMPLOYEE. THIS PAST FEBRUARY THE LABOR COMMISSIONER ISSUE THE LARGEST CITATION IN STATE HISTORY FINING AND LA CONSTRUCTION COMPANY NEARLY TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS. FOR REPEATED WAGE THEFT VIOLATIONS THAT LEFT OVER ONE THOUSAND WORKERS WITHOUT WAITING WEEKS AND EVEN MONTHS FOR THEIR PAYCHECKS. VIOLATIONS LIKE THIS AS WE ALL KNOW -- HAVE A INCREDIBLE HARDSHIP TO WORKING FAMILIES. CURRENT LAW ALLOWS THE LABOR COMMISSIONER TO RECOVER THE PENALTY FOR THE STATE BUT ACCORDING TO THE LABOR COMMISSIONER THIS PENALTY HAS ACTUALLY NOT BEEN COLLECTED. EVEN IF THE PENALTIES WERE TO BE COLLECTED BY THE LABOR COMMISSIONER THE PENALTIES DO NOT GO TO THE WORKER. THIS BILL WILL HELP PROVIDE CALIFORNIA WORKERS SIMPLE AND DIRECT AVENUES FOR RECOVERY WHEN EMPLOYERS. WHO DO NOT PAY ON TIME UNDER EIGHTY SIX SEVENTY THREE THE WORKER? MAYBE COVER A PENALTY THROUGH A HEARING BEFORE THE LABOR COMMISSIONER OR AN INDEPENDENT CIVIL ACTION ANY PENALTY THAT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER RECOVERS. IN A HEARING WILL BE PROVIDED TO THE AFFECTED EMPLOYEE FOR THE INITIAL VIOLATION THE EMPLOYEE WILL RECOVER ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS. FOR EACH SUBSEQUENT VIOLATION OR ANY INTENTIONAL VIOLATION THE EMPLOYEE WOULD RECOVER A TWO HUNDRED DOLLAR PENALTY PLUS 25% OF THE AMOUNT UNLAWFULLY. WITHHELD WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY IS THE NOW THE URBAN. WHO IS THE EXPECTED DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR WORKER RIGHTS AS WELL AS CAROL OF EVENING SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY OF LEGAL LATE AT WORK AND INTRODUCING HER CLIENT? REBECCA DID LIKE [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS CAROL BEING AND I'M A SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY AT LEGAL AID AT WORK TWICE DIRECT THE WAGE PROTECTION PROGRAM. AT THE WHICH PROTECTION PROGRAM WE PROVIDE FREE LEGAL SERVICES TO LOW WAGE WORKERS. LAST YEAR ALONE WE WERE COVERED OVER TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN OWED WAGES TO OUR CLIENTS. WE ARE PROUD CO SPONSORS OF A. B.. SIX SEVENTY THREE THIS LAW IS ABOUT THE MOST BASIC WAGE PROTECTION THE RIGHT TO BE PAID ON TIME. IN MY OVER TEN YEARS OF DOING WAGE CLAIMS NOT BEING PAID IN FULL AND ON TIME IS THE MOST COMMON PROBLEM WE'VE SEEN. THERE IS PRACTICALLY NO CONSEQUENCE FOR AN EMPLOYER NOT TO PAY HIS WORKERS ON TIME THERE MUST BE A PRACTICAL REMEDY OR EMPLOYERS WILL CONTINUE TO MISS PAYDAY. WE SEE WORKERS LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK AND WHO ARE NOT PAID REGULARLY AND THE IMPACTS ARE DEVASTATING. WITH ME TODAY IS ONE OF OUR CLIENTS REBEKAH DID LAKE WHO WORKS IN THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY WE'RE LATE PAYCHECKS ARE ALL TOO COMMON. HI THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. MY NAME IS REBECCA DID LIKE AND I'VE WORKED IN THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY FOR TEN YEARS. I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE IN MISSION BEACH CAFE WHERE I WORKED FROM AUGUST -- TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN TO FOR FEBRUARY. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN DURING MY EMPLOYMENT I WAS OFTEN PAID LATE AND WHEN I WAS PAID MY CHECKS WOULD OFTEN BOUNCE I NEVER KNEW THE NEXT TIME I WAS GETTING PAID OR WHEN THERE WOULD BE. SUFFICIENT FUNDS IN THE ACCOUNT FOR ME TO COLLECT. I OFTEN HAD TO DIP INTO MY SAVINGS TO PAY FOR RENT AND OTHER BILLS I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE A SAVINGS TO RELY ON WHERE SOME OF MY OTHER COWORKERS WERE. NOT AS LUCKY -- I'M PARTICULAR ONE OF MY COWORKERS WAS THREATENED WITH EVICTION BECAUSE OF THE EMPLOYER NOT PAYING HIM ON TIME. AND ANOTHER ONE OF MY CO WORKERS STRESSED BECAUSE HE CAN A FEW THIS FAMILY BECAUSE HE HAD RECEIVED A PAYCHECK YET. I'M ON TOP OF IT BEING VERY STRESSFUL IT IS VERY UNFAIR THAT BECAUSE OF BEING PAID LATE -- EMPLOYEES OFTEN THINK YOU'RE LATE FEES FOR MISSED PAYMENTS AND HOW TO PAY A HIGHER INTEREST RATES ON BILLS AND LOANS -- THIS BILL IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE'S NO EASY WAY FOR AN EMPLOYER TO FORCE YOUR PLAYER TO PAY ON TIME -- IN MY OPINION THIS BILL SHOULD DEFINITELY ALREADY EXIST WE'VE BEEN IN TWO AND A HALF YEARS OF LITIGATION ANDI STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY PENALTIES AND NEITHER HAVE ANY OF MY OTHER COWORKERS. I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DANIELLE URBAN AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR WORKERS RIGHTS I SACRAMENTO BASED LEGAL SERVICES ORGANIZATION. SERVING LOW WAGE WORKERS. WE ARE PROUD CO SPONSORED AB SIX SEVEN THREE BECAUSE UNDER CURRENT LAW THERE'S NO PRACTICAL REMEDY FOR EMPLOYEES WHO ARE NOT PAID ON TIME. AS YOU HAVE JUST HEARD THIS CAN CAUSE EXTREME FINANCIAL HARDSHIP FOR THE MANY EMPLOYEES WHO LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK AND NEED THEIR WAGES PAID ON TIME SO THAT THEY CAN PAY FOR FOOD RENT AND OTHER DAILY NECESSITIES. THE PROBLEM WITH THE CURRENT LAW IS THAT EMPLOYEES WHO ARE PAID THEY HAVE NO CLEAR OR EFFECTIVE RECOURSE THE CURRENT LABOR CODE SECTION. TWO TEN REQUIRES THAT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER RECOVER THE PENALTY THROUGH AN ACTION IN THEIR OWN NAME. EVEN IF THE LABOR COMMISSIONER WAS EXERCISING THIS AUTHORITY WHICH THEY ARE NOT. THEY THE WERE UP PENALTIES WOULD BE PAID TO THE STATE AND NOT TO THE WORKER. THESE EFFORTS TO RECOVER -- FOR LATE PAYCHECKS ARE NOT REALISTIC FOR EMPLOYEES WHO SIMPLY WANT TO BE PAID ON TIME AND BE COMPENSATED FOR THE LOSSES CAUSED BY THE LATE PAYMENTS. AB SIX SEVENTY THREE WILL STRENGTHEN LABOR CODE SECTION TWO TEN SO THAT CAN BE A PRACTICAL TOOL FOR WORKERS TO RECOVER WAGES THAT ARE OVERDUE. FIRST THE PENALTY ALREADY PROVIDED IN LABOR CODE SECTION TWO TEN WILL GO TO THE AGGRIEVED WORKER RATHER THAN THE STATE. THE FIRST INSTANCE OF AN EMPLOYER'S LATE PAYMENT THE EMPLOYEE COULD RECOVER A ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR PENALTY. ON SUBSEQUENT VIOLATIONS OR FOR A WILLFUL OR INTENTIONAL VIOLATION. THE PENALTY WOULD INCREASE TO TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS PLUS THE 25% OF THE AMOUNT UNLAWFULLY WITHOUT. SECOND THIS BILL WOULD ENABLE WORKERS TO ENFORCE THEIR OWN RIGHT UNDER THIS SECTION IN THE SAME WAY THAT THEY CAN ENFORCE THEIR RIGHT TO WAITING TIME PENALTIES. FOR A FINAL PAYCHECK. THAT IS THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE OR THROUGH WITH THE INDEPENDENT CIVIL ACTION. THESE CHANGES TO LABOR CODE SECTION TWO TEN I PROPOSE AN EIGHTY SIX SEVENTY THREE CREATES A DETERRENT FOR EMPLOYERS TO ISSUE LATE PAYCHECKS. IN THE HOPE THAT NO EMPLOYEE HAS TO SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES OF LATE PAYMENT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE'S SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OR AS MERRY GO YOUR SHE HARD WITH THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION PROUD TO CO SPONSOR THE SPELL. THANK YOU MATT BROAD FOR THE TEAMSTERS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. DIPPING AGNETHA CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. CAPTION HOUSTON UNITED STEELWORKERS DISTRICT TWELVE CHAIR WOMEN IS STILL IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. RENEE BAYARDO AS HERE YOU CALIFORNIA SUPPORT THANK YOU. MITCH DYER CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO SUPPORT THANK YOU -- ANYWHERE IN OPPOSITION. FOR A COUPLE SEATS FOR OPPOSITION PLEASE THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TESTIFIED TODAY MY NAME'S LOWER CURTIS AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. A WE DO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL WE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS HOWEVER THEY ESSENTIALLY CREATE THE SAME PROBLEM IN A DIFFERENT WAY FOR US -- BUT WE DO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AUTHOR AND HER STAFF FOR WORKING DILIGENTLY WITH US ON THIS BILL AND FORTUNATE THIS TIME WE ARE STILL IN THE SAME POSITION AS WE PREVIOUSLY WORK -- I'M GOING TO GET INTO SOME DETAILS OF LABOR LAW THAT'S PRETTY BORING FOR MANY BUT I AM THE REASON BEING THAT THE LANGUAGE CHANGES THE PENALTY FROM A CIVIL PENALTY TO A STATUTORY PENALTY. A STATUTORY PENALTY HAS TO GO TO THE EMPLOYEE IN THIS SITUATION WE ARE OKAY WITH THE PENALTY GOING TO THE EMPLOYEE WHAT WE'RE NOT OKAY WITH HIS EMPLOYER BEING PENALIZED TWICE. SO NOW IF THIS INDIVIDUAL BRINGS A CLAIM UNDER THE PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACT THAT'S WHERE CREATE THIS IS BACKING A PENALTIES BECAUSE THEY CAN COVER COVER THE STATUTORY PENALTY. UNDER THIS -- AMENDED PROVISION OF S. BEAR OF AB SIX SEVEN THREE AND THEN THEY WOULD ALSO BE ALLOWED TO RECOVERTHE CIVIL PENALTY UNDER THE POCK ACTION SO AGAIN IT'S A DIFFERENT WAY FOR THE EMPLOYER TO BE PENALIZED TWICE FOR THE SAME ERROR. AGAIN -- FOR LATE PAYMENT OF WAGES THIS CAN BE AYE AYE -- UNDERSTAND THE SPONSORS AND THE SUPPORTERS SAYING THAT THEIR INTENTIONAL VIOLATIONS THIS CAN BE UNINTENTIONAL VIOLATIONS BECAUSE IF YOU UNDER PAYING EMPLOYEE ON ACCIDENT IT'S STILL CONSIDERED A LATE PAYMENT OF WAGES AND SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT A POTENTIAL -- UNINTENTIONAL ERROR THAT CONTINUES TO STACK WITH THESE PA THE PENALTIES AND WE HAVE PROVIDED LANGUAGE TO THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND WE'RE HOPING THAT WE CAN WORK ON THAT LANGUAGE IN ORDER TO ALLEVIATE THOSE CONCERNS THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. JUST TO ADD -- MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN STAFF AND THE SPONSORS IN PARTICULAR. THEY HAVE A DONE A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS THAT ARE NOTED IN YOUR ANALYSIS. ALL OF WHICH WE SUPPORT WE HAVE ASKED FOR ONE ADDITIONAL ONE WHICH WOULD ESSENTIALLY ADDED AN ADDITIONAL SUBDIVISION. TO PRECLUDE THAT DOUBLE RECOVERY HE UNDER THE PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACT IN THE LABOR CODE SO WITH THAT I THINK WE WOULD BE -- NEUTRAL ON THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. WHERE IS RICHEST IN CALIFORNIA HOUSE WITH ASSOCIATION AND WE WOULD LIKE TO ECHO THE CONCERNS OF THE -- CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE OPPOSE HIS BILL. THANK YOU. ENGINE BECAUSE IT ARE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. KATIE HANSON WITH THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION WERE OPPOSED AS WELL. THANK YOU.

THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT WORKERS ARE PAID FAIRLY FOR THE WORK BY PROVIDING CLARITY AS TO WHEN A PREVAILING WAGE IS REQUIRED ON PRECONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES. CURRENTLY THERE IS SOME CONFUSION BETWEEN AWARDING AGENCIES CONTRACTORS AND LABOR GROUPS PERTAINING TO WHEN AND WHERE PREVAILING WAGE REQUIREMENTS APPLY ON PRECONSTRUCTION. ACTIVITIES WHILE STATE LAW MAKES CLEAR THAT PRECONSTRUCTION PHASE OF THE PROJECT FALL UNDER THE DEFINITION. OF PUBLIC PUBLIC WORKS AND THAT'S REQUIRE THE PAYMENT A PREVAILING WAGE THE AMBIGUITY AS TO WHAT IS CONSIDERED PRE CONSTRUCTION WORK HAS LED TO CONFUSION. AMONG STAKEHOLDERS IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY AS TWO ONE PREVAILING WAGE REQUIREMENTS APPLY SITE ASSESSMENTS AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES ARE CRUCIAL TO CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. AS A TYPICALLY ETERMINE THE SUITABILITY OF THE LAND WHERE PROJECT IS TO POTENTIALLY BE BUILT. SIMPLY PUT A PROJECT WOULD TYPICALLY NOT MOVE FORWARD. WITHOUT THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF AN ASSESSMENT OF THE LAND IN AN EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT WORKERS IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY ARE RECEIVING THE PREVAILING WAY TO THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE ENTITLED.
