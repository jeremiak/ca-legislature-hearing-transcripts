00:34:00.572 --> 00:34:02.073 region:rollup2
STARTS THE PROGRAM.

00:34:01.473 --> 00:34:02.741 region:rollup2

AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT. BE WHEN

00:34:20.725 --> 00:34:23.094 region:rollup2
THE POOR FREEZE WHAT'S IN EFFECT

00:34:21.626 --> 00:34:25.397 region:rollup2
FOR ABOUT NINE MONTHS IT WAS

00:34:23.094 --> 00:34:27.632 region:rollup2

THE SEVEN MONTHS.

00:34:34.339 --> 00:34:37.676 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE ALREADY SEEN IT

00:34:36.341 --> 00:34:39.411 region:rollup2

SPORT FREEZE.

00:34:43.281 --> 00:34:46.217 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T BENEFIT THE FUND IT

00:34:44.716 --> 00:34:48.219 region:rollup2
DOESN'T LIMIT THE ABILITY TO GET

00:34:46.217 --> 00:34:49.955 region:rollup2

THAT THE IMPORT FREE SHOULD BE

00:35:42.073 --> 00:35:45.010 region:rollup2
FOUND VERY LIMITED AND WE ARE

00:35:43.508 --> 00:35:46.111 region:rollup2
CONCERNED THAT THIS BILL WOULD

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:47.579 region:rollup2
OPEN IT UP NOT JUST A CITY BUT

00:35:46.111 --> 00:35:49.247 region:rollup2
BEYOND SIXTY DAYS AND WHAT WE

00:35:47.579 --> 00:35:51.649 region:rollup2
HAVE FOUND. IN THE WORK WE'VE

00:35:49.247 --> 00:35:53.551 region:rollup2
DONE WITH CONSUMERS AND ALSO IN.

00:35:51.649 --> 00:35:54.953 region:rollup2
A THE PROCEEDINGS BUT BOTH AT

00:35:53.551 --> 00:35:56.821 region:rollup2
THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL WHAT

00:35:54.953 --> 00:35:58.423 region:rollup2
WE'VE LEARNED IS THAT. APART

00:35:56.821 --> 00:35:59.758 region:rollup2
FREEZE THAT IS TOO LONG IS

00:35:58.423 --> 00:36:01.960 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DETRIMENTAL TO

00:35:59.758 --> 00:36:02.894 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS AND EVEN THOUGH YOU

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:05.830 region:rollup2
HEARD EXAMPLES.

00:36:02.894 --> 00:36:07.766 region:rollup2
OF FRAUD IN IN ABUSE WE

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:08.299 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT THAT CAN CAN

00:36:07.766 --> 00:36:09.601 region:rollup2
OCCUR IN THE SHOULD BE WAY

00:36:08.299 --> 00:36:10.869 region:rollup2
SUGGEST THAT.

00:36:09.601 --> 00:36:12.470 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THE OTHER EVIDENCE THAT

00:36:10.869 --> 00:36:14.673 region:rollup2
WAS PROVIDED TO.

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:16.975 region:rollup2
BOTH FEDERALLY AND STATE LEVEL

00:36:14.673 --> 00:36:18.143 region:rollup2
ON ON THIS ISSUE SHOW THE

00:36:16.975 --> 00:36:19.711 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS BENEFIT WHEN THEY HAVE

00:36:18.143 --> 00:36:21.413 region:rollup2
THE THAT OPTION THE FREEDOM TO

00:36:19.711 --> 00:36:23.048 region:rollup2
MOVE TO VARIOUS CARRIERS THAT IS

00:36:21.413 --> 00:36:24.382 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY VERY IMPORTANT. FOR

00:36:23.048 --> 00:36:25.717 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY

00:36:24.382 --> 00:36:26.618 region:rollup2
THAT THE THAT THE FREEZE WAS

00:36:25.717 --> 00:36:28.253 region:rollup2
ELIMINATED.

00:36:26.618 --> 00:36:30.055 region:rollup2
ANYTHING BEYOND SIXTY DAYS WE

00:36:28.253 --> 00:36:32.190 region:rollup2
THINK IS VERY PROBLEMATIC I

00:36:30.055 --> 00:36:33.958 region:rollup2
THINK WE HAD DISCUSSIONS LAST

AN AGREEMENT ON THAT. ABOUT THIS

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:42.033 region:rollup2
THEN OPENS OPENS UP AGAIN WE

00:36:40.632 --> 00:36:43.535 region:rollup2
THINK JUST THAT A CONSUMER

ISSUES AND CONSUMER PROTECTION

00:36:43.535 --> 00:36:46.538 region:rollup2

FREEZE THAT IS GOING TO BE THAT

00:36:46.538 --> 00:36:50.108 region:rollup2
LONG SO FOR THOSE REASONS WERE

00:36:48.873 --> 00:36:50.875 region:rollup2
POSING AS A MEDIC.

CHECK IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE

00:55:13.210 --> 00:55:16.613 region:rollup2
WAS QUESTIONS.

00:55:14.011 --> 00:55:18.315 region:rollup2
ALL THIS CRAP.

00:55:16.613 --> 00:55:19.883 region:rollup2
UP AHEAD OF A BOOK THE THE

00:55:18.315 --> 00:55:21.351 region:rollup2
CONCERN THAT I HAVE IS JUST MY

00:55:19.883 --> 00:55:22.953 region:rollup2
BACK OF THE ENVELOPE MATH.

00:55:21.351 --> 00:55:23.520 region:rollup2
INDICATES THAT IF WE WERE TO

00:55:22.953 --> 00:55:24.421 region:rollup2
SUCCEED IN GETTING A NINETY

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:25.956 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

00:55:24.421 --> 00:55:28.225 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WAS SUBSTANTIALLY

00:55:25.956 --> 00:55:30.093 region:rollup2
INCREASE THE SURCHARGE ON OTHER

00:55:28.225 --> 00:55:31.795 region:rollup2
PEOPLE'S TELEPHONE BILLS AND IT

00:55:30.093 --> 00:55:33.831 region:rollup2
IT'S AN INEVITABLE MATHEMATICAL

00:55:31.795 --> 00:55:34.832 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCE OF. OF ACHIEVING

00:55:33.831 --> 00:55:36.266 region:rollup2
THAT GOAL AND I DON'T THINK THE

00:55:34.832 --> 00:55:37.868 region:rollup2
MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS WOULD

00:55:36.266 --> 00:55:38.368 region:rollup2
BE OKAY WITH THE AMOUNT OF

00:55:37.868 --> 00:55:40.070 region:rollup2
SURCHARGE THAT WOULD BE

00:55:38.368 --> 00:55:41.538 region:rollup2
REQUIRED.

00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:42.873 region:rollup2
TO SERVICE THAT GONE THAT'S WHY

00:55:41.538 --> 00:55:45.943 region:rollup2
AFTER RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE BUT I

00:55:42.873 --> 00:55:47.144 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE YOUR BEEN.

00:55:45.943 --> 00:55:51.582 region:rollup2
I NEED TO SHOW QUESTIONS FROM

00:55:47.144 --> 00:55:54.351 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

00:55:51.582 --> 00:55:56.320 region:rollup2
MISCREANT WOULD LIKE CLOSE.

THANK YOU I.

00:55:56.320 --> 00:56:00.290 region:rollup2
I WOULD JUST SAY THAT.

00:55:58.155 --> 00:56:01.258 region:rollup2
WE ARE NOT WE'RE CURRENTLY THE

00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:03.193 region:rollup2
WAY THAT THE PROGRAM IS

00:56:01.258 --> 00:56:05.262 region:rollup2
STRUCTURED NOT MEETING.

00:56:03.193 --> 00:56:06.830 region:rollup2
THE GOALS THAT THE THAT IS THE

00:56:05.262 --> 00:56:08.465 region:rollup2
INTENT BEHIND THIS LIFELINE

00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:09.1000 region:rollup2
PROGRAM SO MAYBE THERE'S AN

00:56:08.465 --> 00:56:12.202 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE IT. AND

00:56:09.1000 --> 00:56:13.770 region:rollup2
TO YOUR POINT ABOUT CALIFORNIANS

00:56:12.202 --> 00:56:15.305 region:rollup2
NOT WANTING TO SUPPORT SOMETHING

00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:17.174 region:rollup2
THAT'S GONNA INCREASE SURCHARGE

00:56:15.305 --> 00:56:18.275 region:rollup2
LIKE I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND.

00:56:17.174 --> 00:56:20.077 region:rollup2
BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT

00:56:18.275 --> 00:56:21.912 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S VALUES ALSO ENSURE

00:56:20.077 --> 00:56:22.412 region:rollup2
THAT SENIORS. AND PEOPLE WITH

00:56:21.912 --> 00:56:25.382 region:rollup2
DISABILITIES LOW INCOME

00:56:22.412 --> 00:56:26.950 region:rollup2
FAMILIES.

00:56:25.382 --> 00:56:28.518 region:rollup2
THEY'RE IT THEY'RE NOT ALONE

00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:28.885 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY THE SENIOR POPULATION

00:56:28.518 --> 00:56:30.821 region:rollup2
WHO.

00:56:28.885 --> 00:56:32.322 region:rollup2
OFTEN DOES NOT HAVE THE

00:56:30.821 --> 00:56:34.224 region:rollup2
RESOURCES ARE LIVING PAYCHECK TO

00:56:32.322 --> 00:56:36.159 region:rollup2
PAYCHECK SOURCE SECURITY. TO BE

00:56:34.224 --> 00:56:38.395 region:rollup2
ABLE TO AFFORD WHAT.

00:56:36.159 --> 00:56:39.263 region:rollup2
TRADITIONALLY WOULD BE PAID AND

00:56:38.395 --> 00:56:40.797 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT CALIFORNIA

00:56:39.263 --> 00:56:42.766 region:rollup2
VALUES WERE ALSO SUPPORT.

00:56:40.797 --> 00:56:44.001 region:rollup2
ENSURING THAT SENIORS HAVE THOSE

00:56:42.766 --> 00:56:45.802 region:rollup2
RESOURCES WHICH IS WHERE WE WANT

00:56:44.001 --> 00:56:47.638 region:rollup2
TO GET. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK

FOR THE RECORD I I USE THEM

01:00:40.537 --> 01:00:44.140 region:rollup2

DRUNK DRIVING.

01:00:57.621 --> 01:01:00.891 region:rollup2

01:08:42.018 --> 01:08:46.189 region:rollup2
MR O..

01:08:44.354 --> 01:08:47.857 region:rollup2
EXPOSURE CHAIR SO I LIFTING THE

01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:50.927 region:rollup2
ONE.

01:08:47.857 --> 01:08:52.261 region:rollup2
SERVICE PER HOUSEHOLD RULE BUT

01:08:50.927 --> 01:08:54.030 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY BE A SUBSTANTIAL

01:08:52.261 --> 01:08:55.765 region:rollup2
EXPANSION OF THE PROGRAM.

01:08:54.030 --> 01:08:57.133 region:rollup2
BUT HOW MANY ADDITIONAL

01:08:55.765 --> 01:08:58.167 region:rollup2
HOUSEHOLDS AS A PERCENTAGE OF

01:08:57.133 --> 01:08:59.802 region:rollup2
THOSE CURRENTLY ENROLLED YOU

01:08:58.167 --> 01:09:00.837 region:rollup2
THINK THIS WOULD ADD. AND WHAT

01:08:59.802 --> 01:09:02.372 region:rollup2
IMPACT DO YOU THINK THAT THAT

01:09:00.837 --> 01:09:03.740 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE ON.

01:09:02.372 --> 01:09:06.376 region:rollup2
THE TELEPHONE BILLS OF

01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:07.944 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE NOT RULED.

01:09:06.376 --> 01:09:09.545 region:rollup2
LOOK IT'S MINOR SENATE CAN SPEAK

01:09:07.944 --> 01:09:10.546 region:rollup2
WITHOUT US IN OUR EFFORTS TO TRY

01:09:09.545 --> 01:09:13.116 region:rollup2
TO SERVICE POPULATION.

01:09:10.546 --> 01:09:14.484 region:rollup2
GIVEN THAT THE LARGE PART OF

01:09:13.116 --> 01:09:16.019 region:rollup2
PUBLIC TO QUALIFY THE SOURCES

01:09:14.484 --> 01:09:17.153 region:rollup2
FROM THE UNDERSERVED AT CURRENT

01:09:16.019 --> 01:09:18.654 region:rollup2
LEVELS.

01:09:17.153 --> 01:09:20.089 region:rollup2
OUR VIEWS THIS POPULATION IS

01:09:18.654 --> 01:09:21.557 region:rollup2
NOT THAT LARGE IT WOULD

01:09:20.089 --> 01:09:22.792 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE.

01:09:21.557 --> 01:09:23.793 region:rollup2
THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF CONSUMERS

01:09:22.792 --> 01:09:24.927 region:rollup2
GETTING SERVICE THROUGH WHAT

01:09:23.793 --> 01:09:26.829 region:rollup2
FUND PROGRAM.

01:09:24.927 --> 01:09:28.831 region:rollup2
SO IT'S A.

01:09:26.829 --> 01:09:29.866 region:rollup2
ONE WAY OF SAN FROM UP IMPACT ON

01:09:28.831 --> 01:09:33.136 region:rollup2
THE BUDGET OR INCREASING TAXES A

01:09:29.866 --> 01:09:34.270 region:rollup2
LOT THAT WOULD AFFECT AT ALL.

01:09:33.136 --> 01:09:35.605 region:rollup2
OKAY DOT I KNOW I I HAVE TO

01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:38.074 region:rollup2
DISAGREE WITH THAT BECAUSE THE

01:09:35.605 --> 01:09:39.742 region:rollup2
P. YOU SEE. REGULAR SETS THE

01:09:38.074 --> 01:09:41.277 region:rollup2
SURCHARGE ON TELEPHONE BILLS. TO

01:09:39.742 --> 01:09:42.612 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO FUND THE PROGRAM

01:09:41.277 --> 01:09:44.380 region:rollup2
BASED ON THE CURRENT DEMAND SO I

01:09:42.612 --> 01:09:45.314 region:rollup2
THINK BY DEFINITION IF WE EXPAND

01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:46.849 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLDS ARE

01:09:45.314 --> 01:09:48.051 region:rollup2
ELIGIBLE. THAT EXPANDS THE

01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:49.519 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IN THE FEW SEE WOULD

01:09:48.051 --> 01:09:51.187 region:rollup2
HAVE TO RAISE A SURCHARGE SO

01:09:49.519 --> 01:09:52.288 region:rollup2
WELL I DON'T.

01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:53.289 region:rollup2
COULD SPEAK UP THAT'S WHEN

01:09:52.288 --> 01:09:54.490 region:rollup2
ANOTHER THROUGH THE CHAIR OKAY

01:09:53.289 --> 01:09:54.924 region:rollup2
I'M SORRY I DON'T START A BACK

01:09:54.490 --> 01:09:57.193 region:rollup2
AND FORTH AND IT.

01:09:54.924 --> 01:09:57.527 region:rollup2
IF YOU'D ASKED THE QUESTION YOU

01:09:57.193 --> 01:09:58.761 region:rollup2
MAY RESPOND.

01:09:57.527 --> 01:10:00.463 region:rollup2
.

01:09:58.761 --> 01:10:01.698 region:rollup2
AND I GUESS HE'S ASKING.

01:10:00.463 --> 01:10:02.932 region:rollup2
THAT YOU YOU BELIEVE THAT

01:10:01.698 --> 01:10:04.600 region:rollup2
THERE'S A SKIRT SURCHARGE ON

01:10:02.932 --> 01:10:06.803 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD INCREASE.

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:08.037 region:rollup2
AND YOU WANTED THE ANSWER TO HOW

01:10:06.803 --> 01:10:09.605 region:rollup2
YOU RECONCILE THAT WITH THE

01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:11.240 region:rollup2
ANSWER OF NOT HAVING SURCHARGE

01:10:09.605 --> 01:10:13.576 region:rollup2
INCREASE LET ME RESTATE SO I

01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:15.411 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT. IF THE NUMBER OF

01:10:13.576 --> 01:10:16.446 region:rollup2
PARTICIPANTS IN THE PROGRAM.

01:10:15.411 --> 01:10:18.014 region:rollup2
RISES AS A RESULT OF THIS

01:10:16.446 --> 01:10:19.215 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION THE P. YOU SEEN

01:10:18.014 --> 01:10:21.017 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE NO CHOICE EXCEPT TO

01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:22.018 region:rollup2
RAISE THE SURCHARGE BE ABLE TO

01:10:21.017 --> 01:10:22.318 region:rollup2
FUND THE PROGRAM DO YOU AGREE

01:10:22.018 --> 01:10:23.786 region:rollup2
WITH THAT.

01:10:22.318 --> 01:10:25.488 region:rollup2
ACTION AT THIS YEAR AT THAT

01:10:23.786 --> 01:10:26.889 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THESE SURCHARGE IS

01:10:25.488 --> 01:10:28.458 region:rollup2
ALREADY INCREASED SEVERAL TIMES

01:10:26.889 --> 01:10:29.592 region:rollup2
BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN.

01:10:28.458 --> 01:10:31.561 region:rollup2
AND THERE IS AT LEAST FROM OUR

01:10:29.592 --> 01:10:32.662 region:rollup2
MEASURES FOR AN ADEQUATE BUDGET

01:10:31.561 --> 01:10:33.262 region:rollup2
THE FUND.

01:10:32.662 --> 01:10:35.665 region:rollup2
IT SUCKS MATCH THE PROGRAM NOT

01:10:33.262 --> 01:10:36.799 region:rollup2
ONLY FOR. INCREASE ENROLLMENT

01:10:35.665 --> 01:10:38.768 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO FOR INDIVIDUALS LIKE

01:10:36.799 --> 01:10:39.969 region:rollup2
THAT'S WERE NOT SERVE NOW.

01:10:38.768 --> 01:10:41.070 region:rollup2
OKAY WELL WHAT DEGREE TO

01:10:39.969 --> 01:10:42.905 region:rollup2
DISAGREEMENT LAST YEAR THE P.

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:44.841 region:rollup2
YOU SEE DECREASED THE SURCHARGE

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:45.374 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF DEMAND SO

01:10:44.841 --> 01:10:46.776 region:rollup2
MUCH THAT'S ONE OF MY BIG

01:10:45.374 --> 01:10:47.744 region:rollup2
CONCERNS.

01:10:46.776 --> 01:10:48.277 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLYMAN WITH THIS BILL IS

01:10:47.744 --> 01:10:49.245 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:10:48.277 --> 01:10:50.613 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT IT'S GOING TO

01:10:49.245 --> 01:10:52.148 region:rollup2
INCREASE THE SURCHARGE ON

01:10:50.613 --> 01:10:53.549 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S TELEPHONES BILLS

01:10:52.148 --> 01:10:54.784 region:rollup2
BUT NOT A KIND OF A BIGGER.

01:10:53.549 --> 01:10:56.352 region:rollup2
PHILOSOPHICAL ISSUE WITH THE

01:10:54.784 --> 01:10:58.087 region:rollup2
BILL WHICH IS THAT. THE.

01:10:56.352 --> 01:10:59.188 region:rollup2
MORE UNIVERSAL TELEPHONE

01:10:58.087 --> 01:11:00.656 region:rollup2
SERVICES ACT THAT ESTABLISHED

01:10:59.188 --> 01:11:02.291 region:rollup2
LIFELINE PROGRAM BACK IN TWO

01:11:00.656 --> 01:11:03.826 region:rollup2
THOUSAND TEN THE EXPRESS PURPOSE

01:11:02.291 --> 01:11:05.328 region:rollup2
OF THAT WAS NOT TO GIVE

01:11:03.826 --> 01:11:07.463 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS SOMETHING THAT WE

01:11:05.328 --> 01:11:08.498 region:rollup2
THOUGHT THEY SHOULD HAVE. IT WAS

01:11:07.463 --> 01:11:10.700 region:rollup2
TO GIVE SOMETHING CALIFORNIANS

01:11:08.498 --> 01:11:11.667 region:rollup2
THAT SOMETHING THAT WAS VITAL

01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:13.803 region:rollup2
FOR THEM TO HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE

01:11:11.667 --> 01:11:15.605 region:rollup2
BIGGEST. CONCERNS WAS THE

01:11:13.803 --> 01:11:16.572 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO CALL NINE ONE ONE

01:11:15.605 --> 01:11:17.840 region:rollup2
SOMEONE'S BREAKING YOUR HOUSE OR

01:11:16.572 --> 01:11:19.208 region:rollup2
IF YOU HAVE A MEDICAL EMERGENCY

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:20.409 region:rollup2
BUT THAT WAS REALLY THE DRIVER

01:11:19.208 --> 01:11:22.311 region:rollup2
WHEN THE LIFELINE PROGRAM WAS

01:11:20.409 --> 01:11:24.380 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED. AND THAT'S WHY THE

01:11:22.311 --> 01:11:26.983 region:rollup2
ONE SUBSCRIBER PER HOUSEHOLD

01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:28.317 region:rollup2
RULE WAS SET INTO PLACE SO I

01:11:26.983 --> 01:11:29.619 region:rollup2
HAVE A BIG PROBLEM WITH CHANGING

01:11:28.317 --> 01:11:30.887 region:rollup2
THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE PROGRAM.

01:11:29.619 --> 01:11:32.088 region:rollup2
NO FROM SOMETHING THAT'S VITAL

01:11:30.887 --> 01:11:34.323 region:rollup2
TO SOMETHING THAT WE JUST THINK

01:11:32.088 --> 01:11:34.924 region:rollup2
PEOPLE OUGHT TO HAVE AND THAT'S

01:11:34.323 --> 01:11:40.163 region:rollup2
WHY AFTER RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE

01:11:34.924 --> 01:11:40.830 region:rollup2
IT.

01:11:40.163 --> 01:11:42.198 region:rollup2
I MEAN WANT TO CLEAR THAT UP IN

01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:44.100 region:rollup2
IN WHEN IT BEGAN IT WAS

01:11:42.198 --> 01:11:46.169 region:rollup2
LANDLINES.

01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:47.570 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT THERE WAS THAT.

01:11:46.169 --> 01:11:49.672 region:rollup2
YOU THAT THAT IDEA THAT YOU ONLY

01:11:47.570 --> 01:11:50.573 region:rollup2
PUT ONE LINE IN.

01:11:49.672 --> 01:11:52.308 region:rollup2
YOU INCREASED THE CELLPHONES AND

01:11:50.573 --> 01:11:53.709 region:rollup2
AND.

01:11:52.308 --> 01:11:55.044 region:rollup2
THAT WAS THE VIEW THAT I TOOK

01:11:53.709 --> 01:11:56.712 region:rollup2
AND SECOND OF YOU SOME OF THESE

01:11:55.044 --> 01:11:58.548 region:rollup2
COMMUTERS REPRESENT YOU HAVE.

01:11:56.712 --> 01:12:00.917 region:rollup2

HAVE SEVERAL FAMILIES IN A HOME.

01:12:02.118 --> 01:12:05.621 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT WAS THE VIEW.

01:12:04.554 --> 01:12:06.088 region:rollup2
IT'S ABOUT TWENTY CLEAR THAT

01:12:05.621 --> 01:12:08.958 region:rollup2
THAT PIECE UP FROM MY

01:12:06.088 --> 01:12:10.459 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE.
