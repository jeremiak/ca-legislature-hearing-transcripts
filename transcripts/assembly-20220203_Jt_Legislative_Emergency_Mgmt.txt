SO PLEASE BE RESPECTFUL AND PATIENT ALL PARTIES INTERESTED SO THEY CAN BE HEARD. NOT A BIGGER HEARING TODAY. WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING. AT A NEW AREA THAT THIS. LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE ON EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT HAS NOT TACKLE BEFORE. WE'VE TAKEN A LOOK IN OUR PREVIOUS HEARING AT THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY WRIT LARGE AND SEVERAL CHALLENGES TO BUILDING A JUST FORM OF RESILIENCE. THAT LOOKS AFTER THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE DURING THE DISASTERS THAT. SEEM TO CHALLENGE OUR STATE CONSTANTLY. AND THEN I GUESS IS THE CHALLENGE OF THIS ELEMENT OF THE CRIME EMERGENCY WE'RE EXPLORING TODAY WHICH IS THE TOPIC OF EXTREME HEAT. WE ARE NOT IN A DROUGHT. WE ARE NOT IN A SERIES OF HEAT WAVES WE ARE IN A GREAT DRYING AND REDUPLICATION OF THE WEST MODELS INDICATE THAT TEMPERATURES WILL CLIMB OVER THE COMING DECADES. INTO INTO AREAS THAT WE HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED BEFORE AND IT WILL BE DEAD. THE QUESTION IS CAN WE MITIGATE THESE IMPACTS NOW AND DEAL WITH THESE EMERGENCIES BEFORE THEY START. COURTNEY LUSKIN CENTER AN INNOVATION OUT OF UCLA CALIFORNIANS ARE NOT JUST SEEING THESE HIGHER AVERAGE TEMPERATURES. BUT THE SEVERE HEAT WAVES AND HEAT EXPOSURE THAT COMES WITH THEM WILL BE ONE OF THE GREATEST PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES OF THE COMING DECADES. THEY ARRIVE IN ACUTE AND CHRONIC WAYS AND IT'S OFTEN HIDDEN. IT'S A HOT DAY IT'S A HUNDRED TWENTY DEGREES IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. AND YOU THINK HOW UNCOMFORTABLE I HAVE TO STAY INSIDE. FIND THAT AIR CONDITIONER MAYBE YOU KNOW A FRIEND WHO HAS A POOL. TRY TO GET THROUGH YOUR DAY AND LAST THAT A SEE A ROLL DOWN YOUR WINDOWS IF YOU'RE A SENIOR KERR ISN'T WORKING AND JUST GET THROUGH IT. BUT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMEBOUND WHO HAVE MEDICAL ISSUES WHO ARE DEPENDENT ON STABLE SUPPLIES OF POWER. WHO THEMSELVES CAN'T ALWAYS GET TO A COOLING CENTER DON'T HAVE A FUNCTIONAL AIR CONDITIONING UNIT. DON'T HAVE PROPER HEATING AND COOLING IN THEIR HOME. THESE INCIDENTS ARE DEADLY AND WE'RE GONNA EXPLORE IN MORE DETAIL THE HIDDEN HUMAN COST OF THE EXTREME HEAT. WAIVE THAT IS GOING TO BE FACING OUR STATE AS AN EMERGENCY. AND ONE THAT REALLY DOESN'T CEASE AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE CENTRAL TENSION POINTS WERE GOING TO. INTERROGATE TODAY. IS THAT DURING A FIRE WE HAVE. UNIFIED COMMAND THE KIDS ENACTED- HURRICANE HITS. OR EVEN- TIDAL WAVE. THIS IS THE WORK THAT OUR FIRST RESPONDERS DEAL WITH. IN FLOOD CONDITIONS THEY DECLARE STATE OF EMERGENCY IN A UNIFIED COMMAND CENTERS ESTABLISHED. INCIDENT COMMAND IS ALIGNED AND THEMSELVES AND THEY DO THAT KIND OF PLANNING AND RESPONSE THAT WE EXPECT DURING A CRISIS- THERE ARE NO LINES BUREAUCRACY DOESN'T MATTER THERE OUGHT BE NO TURF. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO A CASCADING EMERGENCY LIKE EXTREME HEAT OR IN CONFLUENCE WITH THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY GIVEN ONGOING SITUATION WHERE YOU NEED THAT SAME UNIFIED COMMAND APPROACH. BUT EFORE THE BEFORE THE DISASTER HAPPENS AND I THINK IF WE FOUND A WAY TO APPROACH HAZARD MITIGATION. HAZARD MITIGATION. WHICH HAS BEEN A NEW IN AN EVOLVING PLACE FOR FEMA'S WORK- NATIONWIDE IN CONGRESS IS CERTAINLY INVESTED IN THIS SPACE ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS. THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN LOOKING AT MORE THESE PREVENTIVE MEASURES BUT IF WE CAN START TO GET AHEAD IT WILL BE WITH US FOR DECADES TO COME AND FIND A WAY TO BUILD RESILIENCE INTO OUR COMMUNITIES. WE'RE GOING TO BE SAFER AND WE'RE GONNA BE MORE RESILIENT. AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THOSE LIVES ON OUR HANDS. RIGHT NOW A LOT OF US DON'T WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE NUMBERS. WE DON'T TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DYING. AND WE DON'T EVEN WANT TO COUNT THEM. AND THAT'S A PROBLEM SO I'M HOPING TODAY SHED SOME LIGHT ON INVESTIGATIONS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN OUR- IN OUR NEWSPRINT- THE L. A. TIMES HAD AN ONGOING PEACE THAT. RNLI BROUGHT THINGS TO MY ATTENTION AND INTRUSIVE IN LINES AROUND THE ISSUE THAT I SAW JUST PERSONALLY IN THE COMMUNITY. YOU KNOW WHEN WE HAVE WILD FIRES IN. IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY RIGHT ON THE HILLSIDES IN CHATSWORTH AND- DOWN IN THE CANOGA PARK IN THREE NORTHRIDGE ALONG THE NORTHERN RIDGE. THE WINDS KICK IN THE FIRES ARE. THE FIRES ARE EVER PRESENT AND THE POWER LINES OFTEN SHUT DOWN. AND USUALLY THOSE ARE ON THE HOTTEST DAYS SO IF IT'S A HUNDRED TWENTY ONE DEGREES OUT AND YOUR POWERS DOWN WHAT HAPPENS I ARRIVED AT A WOMAN'S DOORSTEP WITH EXACTLY THAT SITUATION. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THERE TO DELIVER A- A SOLAR BATTERY KIT THOUSAND DOLLAR YETI THAT- THE SOCAL EDISON IS NOW DISTRIBUTING THROUGHOUT THE SOUTHLAND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY PS PS. BUT THAT DAY. THAT SYSTEM- WASN'T ENOUGH FOR HER- AND THE TRIP TO THE HOSPITAL AND THE EXPERIENCE IS GOING THROUGH THE I. C. U. AND- YOU KNOW. WE DO IT'S A REAL THING AND- AND WE KNOW THEY'RE COMING AND SO IF WE KNOW THESE EMERGENCIES ARE COMING WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO GET AHEAD OF THEM. THOSE ARE MY OPENING REMARKS BUT THE OTHER THING I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT HERE TODAY IS THAT THIS WILL BE OUR FIRST OPPORTUNITIES A LEGISLATURE. TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE DRAFT OF THE GOVERNOR'S EXTREME HEAT ACTION PLAN. THEY PUT FORCED THIS DOCUMENT- IN RECENT WEEKS AND I'M I'M THRILLED TO HAVE. THEIR LEAD SPOKESPEOPLE IN SOME OF THEIR KEY AGENCY FOLKS. COMING OF THIS HEARING TODAY TO HEAR WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S PLANNING I APPLAUD GOVERNOR NEWSOM. FORGETTING PROACTIVE IN VERY INTENTIONAL AND CROSS JURISDICTIONAL ABOUT THIS. I THINK THE REPORT AS A GOOD HIGH LEVEL START- TO REALLY CREATING A UNIFIED EFFORT THROUGHOUT GOVERNMENT. AND FOR PICKING UP THAT BALL WE ARE TRULY GRATEFUL IN THE HOTTEST PARTS OF THE STATE. SUSANJUST A LOS ANGELES ISSUE WE KNOW THIS IS CENTRAL VALLEY WE KNOW THIS IS. THE INLAND EMPIRE WE KNOW THIS GOES DOWN OUT TO SAN DIEGO WE KNOW WHAT'S IN THE FAR NORTH. HE DOESN'T DISCRIMINATE. SO I'M GRATEFUL TO HAVE MY COLLEAGUES HERE TODAY- FROM. FURTHER DOWN IN THE SOUTH LANDING AND EVEN FURTHER SOUTH THAN THAT- SO I WOULD TURN IT OVER TO MY VICE CHAIR. THE MEMBER RODRIGUEZ AND OFFER YOU SOME OPPORTUNITY SOME OPENING REMARKS THANKS. YES I WANT TO THANK SENATOR STERN FOR HOLDING THIS IMPORTANT HEARING ON EXTREME HEAT EMERGENCIES. AS YOU KNOW OUR CHANGING CLIMATE RESPONSIBLE FOR RISING TEMPERATURES THAT ARE CALIFORNIA WORK EACH YEAR ROUTINELY SEE RECORD BREAKING DAYS OF HEAT. OURS AS A RESULT OF ONE OF MOST SERVERS THREAT TO PUBLIC HEALTH OF CALIFORNIANS COME FROM THE HIGHER FREQUENCY OF EXTREMELY HE CONDITIONS. AND ATTENDED A CALIFORNIA HEAT WAVE IN TWO THOUSAND SIX OVER SIX HUNDRED FIFTY FIFTY PEOPLE DIED DUE TO HEAT RELATED CONDITIONS. THE TWO THOUSAND SIX CALIFORNIA HEATWAVE SAW AN INCREASE IN EMERGENCY VISITS AND HOSPITALIZATIONS FOR HEAT RELATED ILLNESSES ESPECIALLY AND THE NORMALLY COOLER COASTAL COMPANIES. HEATWAVES ARE SOCIALLY WITH INCREASED HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS FOR CARDIOVASCULAR KIDNEY AND RESPIRATORY DISORDERS. OLDER ADULTS THE VERY YOUNG AND PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESSES AND CHRONIC DISEASES ARE ALSO AT HER WRIST DURING EXTREME. HEAT HOWEVER. EVEN YOUNG AND HEALTHY PEOPLE CAN BE AFFECTED IF THEY PARTICIPATE IN STRENUOUS PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN ESTIMATED TO HAVE MORE THAN ONE MILLION PEOPLE THAT ARE SPECIALLY VULNERABLE TO EXTREME HEAT. WAVES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE BECOME MORE FREQUENT AND TENTS. LONGER LASTING OVER THE PAST FIVE DECADES ONE STUDY FOUND THAT IN LOS ANGELES WILL EXPERIENCE AN AVERAGE OF TWENTY TWO EXTREME HEAT DAYS ANNUALLY BY TWENTY FIFTY. HOW FROM SIX DAYS IN THE PERIOD FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY TO. TWO THOUSAND. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA AVERAGES THIRTY FIVE DENVER C. DAYS A YEAR BY TWENTY FIFTY THE STATE IS PROJECTED TO ALMOST FIFTY SUCH DAYS A YEAR. EXTREME HEAT NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF HEALTH EMERGENCIES IT IS ALSO CREATING OTHER EMERGENCIES THAT SEVERELY THREATENED CALIFORNIA. EXTREME HEAT AND CLIMATE CHANGE IS COMING CALIFORNIA'S TREES AN INCREASE IN RATES. AND THIS I'M PERCENT A NUMBER OF DYING TREES CREATING UNCOMMONLY DESTRUCTIVE AND DEADLY FIRE SEASONS. I WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THIS COMMITTEE TO STUDY CALIFORNIA'S RESPONSE TO EXTREME HEAT EMERGENCIES ESTABLISHING A COMPREHENSIVE POLICY. TO ADDRESS THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE AND WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR LUCK LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND OUR FIRST RESPONDERS WILL SAVE LIVES. ALSO MISTER CHARACTER PERMISSION I WOULD LIKE TO READ A STATEMENT ON BEHALF OF. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS WAS UNABLE TO JOIN US FOR THIS HEARING YES ABSOLUTELY. I WANT TO THANK FIRST OR BY THANK YOU BOTH THE CHAIR THE VICE CHAIR OF ORGANIZING THIS JOINT LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE. ON EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT HEARING ON EXTREME HEAT. THIS IS AN ISSUE OF ELEVATED SINCE MY ARRIVAL TO THE LEGISLATURE. AS A REPRESENTATIVE TO A LARGELY DISADVANTAGED LATINO COMMUNITY EXTREME HEAT IS MORE THAN JUST A CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUE THAT THAT ALSO ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUE EXTREME HEAT OFTEN HAVE LARGE EXPANSES OF CONCRETE LESS GREENERY A HIGHER DENSITY HOUSING. LOWER AVERAGE INCOMES AND POOR HEALTH STATUSES. AND HE IS ONLY WORSENING THE FIVE HOTTEST YEARS ON RECORD ARE NINETEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY. YEAR AFTER YEAR WE HAVE WITNESSED RECORD BREAKING HEAT WAVE THAT HAVE LED TO MORE POWER OUTAGES COMPROMISED WATER QUALITY INCREASE IN POLLUTION AND MORE INTENSE WILDFIRES. BY SURE AUTHORED AB FIVE EIGHTY FIVE WHICH WOULD HAVE COORDINATED STATE EFFORTS TO HELP URBAN AND RURAL COMMUNITIES COMBAT EXTREME. HEAT BY CREATING THE EXTREME HEAT AND COMMUNITY RESILIENCY PROGRAM UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH. THE PROGRAM WOULD ALSO ESTABLISH CALLING FOR COPPER AND COMPETITIVE GRANT PROCESS THAT WOULD HAVE HELPED LOCAL ENTITIES COMPLETE MEASURES THAT REDUCE EXTREME HEAT. UNFORTUNATELY THE BILL'S HELD IN SENATE APPROPRIATIONS BUT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING TO ELEVATE THIS ISSUE OF EXTREME HEAT AND BRING THE ATTENTION. THAT THE ISSUE DESERVES I'M GREAT FOR JUST THAT AND FOR THE FIRST TIME. EXTREME HEAT IS BEING ANALYZED AS OF MARCH A CRISIS THAT IT IS. WE NOW MUST ACT TO PREVENT HEAT RELATED ILLNESSES. BETTER PER LOCAL KOMMER COMMUNITIES FOR THOSE EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS AND BUILD RESILIENCY INTO OUR COMMUNITIES. ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU MEMBERS AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORK WITH YOU ON THIS ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR- SOME MEMBERS SAY ART OF YOU WANT TO MAKE IT. JUST A WELCOMING COMMENT HERE. THANK YOU. YEAH THERE BUT TO PUSH. FOR MINOR THERE WE GO. I THANK YOU FOR CHAIR FOR HAVING THIS IS A CON- BEING PREPARED FOR HEAT IS LIKE BEING PREPARED FOR ANY OTHER EMERGENCY I'M SURE BACK EAST- THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WISHING THEY WERE MORE PREPARED FOR THE COLD. AIR EXPERIENCING AN EXTREME EVENT IN IN BACK EAST RIGHT NOW WE PRAY FOR ALL THOSE PEOPLE. BUT THERE'S TWO THINGS THERE'S AN INDIVIDUAL COMPONENT AND RESPONSIBILITY TO THAT THERE'S ALSO GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITY AND- PART OF THAT INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY IS KNOWING YOUR OWN- SITUATIONS AND PLANNING FOR THAT AHEAD OF TIME. THE GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITY IS TO HELP RAISE AWARENESS OF COURSE- SO THAT PEOPLE KNOW THAT- IS THAT SOMETHING THAT THEY NEED TO PLAN FOR. BUT IT'S ALSO TO ENSURE THAT THE BASIC THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO DEAL WITH EXTREME HEAT ARE AVAILABLE WHEN THEY NEED IT. ENSURING WATER SUPPLY AND DISTRIBUTION. OBVIOUSLY IS A FIREFIGHTER I GUESS WHAT WE BATTLE HEAT WITH WE DO HAVE A LITTLE WITH WATER. AND SO ENSURING A WATER SUPPLY SO PEOPLE CAN USE THAT FOR COOLING MEASURES WHEN THEY NEED IT AND THE DISTRIBUTION. ARM AND THAT- THAT THAT ENCOMPASSES EVERYBODY IN THIS STATE- ALSO ENSURING ADEQUATE ELECTRICAL SUPPLY AND DISTRIBUTION BECAUSE THE OTHER COOLING THAT PEOPLE TAKE OR IN WHAT THEIR CONDITION IS AN ACTOR. ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE A HIGH HEAT EVENTS- THAT CREATES QUITE A STRAIN ON THE CURRENT DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. AND SO IT'S AND IT'S INCUMBENT ON US IN THE GOVERNMENT TO ENSURE THAT THOSE SUPPLIES ARE ADEQUATE. AND FOR THE MOST EXTREME- TIMES IN OUR IN OUR- CYCLE FOR THE YEAR- I ALREADY TALK ABOUT RAISING PUBLIC AWARENESS BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO DO. BUT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS A PROVIDING FOR THOSE THAT CAN'T- THERE IS A LOT OF PEOPLE AS POINTED OUT BY MY COLLEAGUES THAT- DID YOU NEED TO- INDEED NEED HELP IN THAT DEPARTMENT AND IT'S OUR JOB TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN BEST HELP THEM GET THROUGH THESE. THESE EVENTS FUTURE AND PLANNING TO DEAL WITH IT THAT'S OUR GREATEST RESPONSIBILITY. AND SO WE NEED TO DO- THIS THIS I THINK OPENS UP THAT CONVERSATION. BUT THE BIGGEST THING YOU NEED IS TO HAVE THE TOOLS AND A PLAN BEFORE YOU NEED IT. AND NOT TRYING TO GET IT. DURING THE EVENT BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES WE START THINKING MORE ABOUT WHEN HE COMES. HOW WE GET PEOPLE HELP WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THEIR TOOLS THAT THEY EED PRIOR TO. SO WITH THAT I AM HST HERE FROM SOME OF THE EXPERTS- AND THE TESTIMONY THAT THEY HAVE TO OFFER US AND- AGAIN TO BUY PRECIADO YOUR INTELLIGENCE AND HAVING THIS CONVERSATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR YOUR VALUABLE INPUT AND LIVED EXPERIENCE HERE IT WILL BE AN ASSET TO THIS COMMITTEE- I DO WANT TO GET STARTED WE HAVE A PACKED HEARING AND- YOU KNOW IT THE PANELISTS ALL KNOW THIS ALREADY BUT I'LL JUST MAKE ONE MORE REMINDER SO. WE ARE GOING TO DO VERY SHORT- IT'S OF TESTIMONY SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE. THREE MINUTE SPEAKING FOR. EACH SET OF- FOR EACH WITNESS BUT THERE WILL BE AMPLE TIME HOPEFULLY FOR SOME DISCUSSION AND FEEDBACK HERE AS WELL- WE HAVE ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES HERE FOR THIS UPCOMING PANEL UP WE'RE GOING TO. TRY TO HIT OUR- OUR BENCHMARKS BUT I WANT TO GIVE ADEQUATE FLEXIBILITY TO THE ADMINISTRATION I KNOW THAT- I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE A MAN AMONG THE HANS HANSEN. WITH IT IS THE DEPUTY SECRETARY CLIMATE RESOURCES AGENCY AND THEN THERE'S NEW IN TARA KEY WHO IS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR CLIMATE RESILIENCE FOR THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH AND THEY'VE BEEN SELECTED BY. THE GOVERNOR'S CALIFORNIA EXTREME HEAT ACTION PLAN- FOR PRESENTATION BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE TO TALK US THROUGH SOME OF THESE ISSUES. AND- YEAH WE APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS NOT- THERE'S NO SORT OF FORMAL NOTICE AND COMMENT PERIOD- BUT THAT THIS. THIS PROCESS HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE WILL HOPEFULLY GIVE THE PUBLIC AND THE LEGISLATURE SOME DEEPER INSIGHT INTO HOW THE ADMINISTRATION'S HOPING TO PURSUE THIS MATTER- SO I WANT TO WELCOME. MISS HANSEN AND MISS- IS KEY TO THE PANEL AND YOU CAN TAKE IT AWAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE INTRODUCTION FOR ORGANIZING THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING. MY NAME IS AMANDA HANSEN AND I SERVED AS A DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR CLIMATE CHANGE AT THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY. HELLO I AM NEW IN TORQUAY AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR CLIMATE RESILIENCE IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH AND I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY. THANK YOU WE'RE REALLY GRATEFUL TO BE HERE BOTH TO LEARN FROM ALL THE SPEAKERS EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE AND TO ALSO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S EXTREME HEAT ACTION PLAN. A DRAFT OF THIS PLAN WAS RELEASED ON JANUARY TENTH. AND IT OUTLINES A STRATEGIC AND COMPREHENSIVE SET OF ACTIONS STATE ACTIONS TO ADAPT AND BUILD RESILIENCE TO EXTREME HEAT. I'M GOING TO PROVIDE SOME BACKGROUND ON THE PROCESS AND PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT UNDERTAKEN TO DEVELOP THE DRAFT AND THEN YOU WOULD TARA WILL THEN DETAIL HOW THAT PUBLIC INPUT. TRULY GUIDED OUR APPROACH AND OUR NEXT STEPS. NEXT SLIDE. SO CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITIES NATURAL SYSTEMS AND ECONOMY ARE ALREADY BEING IMPACTED BY RISING TEMPERATURES AS OUTLINED IN SOME OF. THE SPEAKERS BEFORE ME TWENTY TWENTY ONE WAS THE HOTTEST SUMMER ON RECORD IN CALIFORNIA. YEAH BALLY HIT ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY DEGREES IN JULY SETTING A WORLD RECORD FOR THE HOTTEST MEASURE TEMPERATURE IN HISTORY. AND FRESNO SAW OVER SIXTY DAYS ABOUT A HUNDRED DEGREES. CALIFORNIA'S FOURTH CLIMATE CHANGE ASSESSMENT PROJECTS THIS TREND WILL CONTINUE. EVIDENCE IN EACH OF THE REGIONAL REPORTS EVERY CORNER OF THE STATE WILL EXPERIENCE HIGHER AVERAGE TEMPERATURES AND MORE FREQUENT AND EXTREME HEAT EVENTS. CALIFORNIA'S DAILY MAXIMUM AVERAGE TEMPERATURE IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE UP TO NEARLY SIX DEGREES FAHRENHEIT BY TWENTY FIFTY. NINE DEGREES FAHRENHEIT SENATOR STERN ELOQUENTLY EXPLAINED IN HIS OPENING REMARKS AS AS DID OTHERS WE KNOW EXTREME HEAT POSES PROFOUNDLY DISPROPORTIONATE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE AMONG US. AGING POPULATIONS IN CHILDREN PREGNANT PEOPLE AND PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC ILLNESSES ARE EPECIALLY SENSITIVE TO HEAT EXPOSURE. COMBINING THESE CHARACTERISTICS AN EXISTING HEALTH INEQUITIES WITH ADDITIONAL FACTORS SUCH AS POVERTY OR HOUSING INSECURITY CAN PUT INDIVIDUALS AT DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH RISK. OF HEAT RELATED ILLNESS AND DEATH. FIVE THE THROUGHOUT MOST OF LAST YEAR THE RESOURCES AGENCY AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH CO COORDINATED THE DEVELOPMENT OF CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE ADAPTATION STRATEGY. THANKS TO THIS STRATEGY ARE REQUIRED EVERY THREE YEARS AND PROVIDED A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND THINK THROUGH OUR APPROACH INCLUDING THROUGH IDENTIFYING WHETHER AND WHERE WE MAY HAVE GAPS. AND THE NEED FOR AN UP TO DATE APPROACH TO EXTREME HEAT WAS IDENTIFIED EARLY ON. WE COMMITTED TO UPDATING AND EXPANDING THE STATE'S TWENTY THIRTEEN REPORT ON EXTREME HEAT. CALL PREPARING CALIFORNIA FOR EXTREME HEAT GUIDANCE AND RECOMMENDATIONS NEXT FIVE. WE WORK WITH PARTNERS ACROSS THE ADMINISTRATION TO BUILD A STRATEGIC AND COMPREHENSIVE SET OF STATE ACTIONS TO ADAPT AND BUILD RESILIENCE TO EXTREME HEAT. INCLUDING THE COLLEAGUES WHO ARE HERE WITH US TODAY ALONG WITH THOSE IN AGENCIES YOU SEE LISTED ON THE SLIDE. AD MORE- THIS APPROACH REALLY REFLECTS OUR ADMINISTRATION'S COMMITMENT TO ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE LIKE THE CRISIS THAT IT IS WORKING ACROSS ALL AGENCIES TO BREAK DOWN SILOS. TO DRAW CONNECTIONS BETWEEN SECTORS TO DEVELOP A DIVERSE SUITE OF ACTIONS NEXT FIVE. THE DRAFT EXTREME HEAT ACTION PLAN WAS DEVELOPED THROUGH EXTENSIVE PUBLIC INPUT OVER THE COURSE OF LAST YEAR. WE HELD TEN REGIONAL WORKSHOPS WE HAVE NUMEROUS CONSULTATIONS WITH CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES AND WE HELD IN EXTREME HEAT WORKSHOP SERIES. EACH OF THE WORKSHOPS WE INVITED SPEAKERS FROM ACROSS CALIFORNIA TO SHARE CASE STUDIES. BEST PRACTICES AND STORIES ABOUT COMMUNITY RESILIENCE. PROVIDED UPDATES ON HOW THE INPUT WE WERE GATHERING WITH SHAPING THE ACTION PLAN. AND WE INVITED PARTICIPANTS TO SHARE MORE ABOUT THEIR PRIORITIES FOR ACTION. WE FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO COME HERE TODAY AND TO SHARE WITH YOU. TWO KEY FINDINGS THAT EMERGED FROM IT THIS EXPERIENCE. AND HOW THOSE FINDINGS FROM THE PUBLIC INPUT WE RECEIVE REALLY SHAPED THE DRAFT STRUCTURE AND CONTENT. THANK YOU SO MUCH OF MY DAD AND AS A MOTHER JUST OUTLINED I'M GOING TO. COVER THOSE TO KEEP FINDINGS THAT INFORM AND SHAPE ACTION PLAN. SO THE FIRST- WAS AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH WORKSHOPS AND IN ALL TEN OF OUR STATE CLIMATE ADAPTATION STRATEGY REGIONAL WORKSHOPS THAT AMONG THE MENTIONED. WE ASKED PARTICIPANTS HOW EXTREME HEAT IMPACTED THEM THEIR COMMUNITY AND THEIR REGIONS AND WHAT EMERGED WAS A SUITE OF PROMINENT THEMES FROM THE HUNDREDS. OF RESPONSES THAT WERE SHARED- IS EXTREME SEVERELY IMPACT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY AND EXACERBATE EXISTING INEQUITIES. IT INCREASES THE THREATS OF WILDFIRES DROUGHT AND POOR AIR QUALITY AND BURDENS ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE IT HAS ECONOMIC COSTS INCLUDING DISRUPTIONS TO SUPPLY CHAINS AND HE INDUSTRIES. AND THREATENS THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF OUR NATURAL SYSTEMS. THE SECOND FINDING THAT EMERGE FROM OUR PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT RELATES TO THE STATE'S ROLE IN ADDRESSING EXTREME HEAT. AND WE ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS IN EACH WORKSHOP AND MAJOR THEMES THAT EMERGED HELPED US DEVELOP BRANDS RECOMMENDED ACTIONS. OR AREAS WERE STATE ACTION WAS IDENTIFIED AS MOST USEFUL INCLUDING ONE DRIVING COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION BOTH ACROSS LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AND WITH OTHER ENTITIES SUCH AS UTILITIES THE PRIVATE SECTOR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS NONPROFITS AND BEYOND. THE SECOND IS SUPPORTING LOCAL CLIMATE ADAPTATION ACTION THROUGH FINDING OPPORTUNITIES AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ACROSS CALL FOR ACTION TRACKS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE ACTION PLANS WELCOME TO THOSE IN JUST A SECOND. THIRD OKAY. APPROACH TO EXTRA HEAT ACT THAT DRIVES A THE UNIT NEED RIGHT AND ACT OPINION DOUBLE MOLD BENEFITS IN ADDITION TO REDUCING HEAT REST ACTIONS THAT ADDRESS THIS CLIMATE RIGHT CAN ALSO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS INCREASE PUBLIC HEALTH PROVIDE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AND INCREASED ACCESS TO MAJOR. SO BUILDING ON THE EXTENSIVE IN BUT WE RECEIVED OVER THE COURSE OF LAST YEAR WE STRUCTURED THE PLANNED AROUND FOR ACTION TRACKS BASED ON ALL THIS ON THE WORKSHOP SERIES AND THE ENGAGEMENT WE OUTLINED ABOUT BEFORE. THE TRACKS HERE ARE LISTED ON THE SCREEN BUT THEY ARE TO BUILD PUBLIC AWARENESS AND NOTIFICATION STRENGTHENING COMMUNITY SERVICES AND RESPONSE INCREASED THE RESILIENCE OF OUR BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND UTILIZED NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS. UNDER EACH ACTION TRACK THEIR CONSISTENT TO DIFFERENT SECTIONS THE FIRST ARE ESTABLISHED ACTIONS WHICH TELL THE STORY OF I'M GOING STATE ACTIONS RELATED TO EXTREME HEAT. THOSE ESTABLISH ACTIONS CALLED FOR IN THE TWENTY THIRTEEN REPORT INCLUDING THE IMPLEMENTATION. AND THE SECOND ARE RECOMMENDED ACTIONS WHICH ADDRESS IMPORTANT NEEDS FOR STRENGTHENING RESILIENCE TO EXTREME HEAT. AND WE CONSIDER ALL ACTIONS RECOMMENDED BY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. IN DEVELOPING THE DRAFT. AND WE ALSO HOPE THE ACT PLAN ROTH THE WE HONOR. AS THE STATE BY JUST PRIORITY AND YOUR LEADERS ON AND HE- INCLUDING MANY OF THE POINTS THAT WE HEARD THE OPENING REMARKS HERE TODAY. INCLUDE TURNING UP AND- STATEWIDE RESPONSE AN EXTREME HEAT ACROSS ALL OF CAL. ENSURING INVESTMENTS IN EXTREME HEAT ACTIONS PRIORITIZE THE MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. AND THIRD PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT THE TRIBAL LOCAL AND REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS. AND THE ADMINISTRATION LOOKS FORWARD TO CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND STAKEHOLDERS TO FINALIZE AND IMPLEMENT THE EXTREME HEAT ACTION PLAN. BUT WE ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO BUILDING ON LAST YEAR'S INVESTMENTS IN EXTREME HEAT WHICH INCLUDE A SUITE OF INVESTMENTS INCLUDING URBAN AND COMMUNITY FORESTRY AND- RAINING. A NEW COMMUNITY RESILIENCE AND HE RAN IN OUR OFFICE THE OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH FUNDING FOR COMMUNITY RESILIENCE CENTERS AND INVESTMENTS IN THE LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM WE ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON PROGRAMMING THE EXTREME HEAT. OUTSIDE SO TO WRAP I WANTED JUST QUICK GO OVER OUR NAY STEPS AND TRY. THE LAST WEEK WE KNOW THE FINAL PUBLIC WORKSHOP OUR EXT HEAT SERIES ASSEMBLY INPUT ON THE- WE WERE FEEDBACK FROM ABOUT I'M TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PARTISAN. AND ARE CURRENTLY PROCESS WHAT WE SHARE I'M GOING FINALLY THE PLAN THIS. IN ADDITION TO. THE FINAL EXTREME HEAT ACTION PLANS FEEDBACK ON THE DRAFT WILL HELP SHAPE OUR PROPOSAL TO THE LEGISLATURE IN THE SPRING FOR INVESTING THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE SENATE SIDE IT WAS INCLUDED AS PART OF THE CLIMATE RESILIENCE PACKAGE AND LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. TO ADDRESS EXTREME HEAT. I ALSO WANT TO KNOW THE PROP ON THE HEAT ACTION WILL BE TRACKED THROUGH THE STATE DEPARTMENT ADAPTATION STRATEGIES AND IMPLEMENTATION REPORTING PROCESS. AND WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK YOU MANY CHAIRS MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU DEPUTY SECRETARY AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR WE DO APPRECIATE. YOUR TESTIMONY- HOW DEFERRED IF ANY OF MY FELLOW COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE ANY INITIAL QUESTIONS- I KNOW I HAVE A FEW BUT I'LL I'LL KICK IT TO YOU ALL. FIRST IF YOU'D LIKE AND I ALSO WANT TO WELCOME CENTER TO MOAN TO. TO THE COMMITTEE- THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. BUT ANYONE IS ONE WANT TO CHIME IN WITH I'VE GOT A FEW. OKAY I'LL START I'LL JUST START REAL QUICKLY HERE- THE TIMELINE FOR FINAL COMMENTS ON THIS I KNOW IT'S NOT A FORMAL PERIOD BUT- IT'S THE MIDDLE OF FEBRUARY IS THAT CORRECT. LAST WHEN THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS GIVE A DATE ON THAT. SENATOR STERN AT. THE APPROACH THAT WE TOOK TO RECEIVING PUBLIC FEEDBACK ON THE DRAFT ACTION PLAN WAS TO UTILIZE OUR EXTREME HEAT WORKSHOP SERIES. SO THAT YOU KNOW WE WELCOME PEOPLE PROVIDING INPUT ON THE- THE DRAFT WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF GOING THROUGH WHAT WE HEARD. AND ARE. THANK YOU SEE YOU'RE STILL GOING THROUGH THOSE COMMENTS YOU RECEIVED A BUNCH INPUT AT THAT WORKSHOP THAT THOSE ONE FIFTY COMMENTS OKAY. SO NO CONCLUSIONS YET FROM THE FEEDBACK YOU RECEIVED I MEAN WHAT WOULD YOU JUST IF YOU WERE TO CHARACTERIZE- THE RANGE OF ISSUES AYE THE ONE THING WE'VE HEARD IS A COMMITTEE I THINK AS WE'VE EXPLORED AND TALK SOME OF THE SAME STAKEHOLDERS WILL BE HEARING FROM. BUT EVERYONE WANTS MORE DETAIL AND THEY WANT THE ACTION PLAN TO BE AS ACTIONABLE AS POSSIBLE AND I KNOW THAT'S PART OF THE PROCESS. OF MAKING THE FRAME RATE- AND SORT OF GETTING YOUR SCIENCE BASIS FOR IT ALL RIGHT AND PUTTING. PUTTING A STRUCTURE IN PLACE BUT I THINK THAT THE- THE GOOD FRUSTRATION THAT I'VE HEARD OUT THERE IS THAT. PEOPLE JUST WANT MORE DETAIL WHETHER IT'S FOCUSING ON PUBLIC HEALTH WEATHER IS THE SPECIFICS THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE GOING TO NEED FOR. GETTING THEIR SPECIFIC- ARMS MOVING INTO THIS SPACE AND GETTING THEIR PLANS EFFECTUATED- YOU KNOW THERE WE'VE BEEN WORKING. WITH NOT JUST ASSEMBLYMEMBER RIVAS WHO WERE HER STATEMENT READ EARLIER BUT- SOME ERROR SEE A AND A SIMILAR ROBERT RIVAS IS WELL AND THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER ON- ON SOME OF THE RATING SYSTEMS AND WAYS TO DO- HEAT WAVE EVENTS SO WE APPRECIATE SOME OF THAT. FOCUS ON EDUCATION. AND SORT OF AN OUTWARD FACING PUBLIC AWARENESS COMPONENT- I WAS ENCOURAGED TO SEE HE HAS SOME OF THE ELEMENTS FOCUSING ON I. HSS WAYS TO USE OUR CARE WORK FORCE. I THINK THAT'S A REALLY RIGHT AND IF I WERE TO SAY THERE'S ONE LANE THAT I'M TRYING TO. MAKE SURE IS CARVED OUT IN ALL OF THIS IS JUST WHAT WE CAN DO IN THE HOME I KNOW THERE'S A- THERE'S A LOT OF EFFORT AND WE WANT TO SEE RESILIENCE HUBS BE BUILT- WE WANT TO SEE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE BACKSTOPS. WE WANT COOL BUILDINGS IN SERVICES AND I THINK THAT HAVE TO BE THE OVER ARCHING RESILIENCE FRAMEWORK BUT- MY INITIAL QUESTION FOR YOU ALL WITH JUST. HOW DO YOU SEE HE IN THE HOME BEING A PART OF THIS FRAMEWORK FOR ESPECIALLY FOR THE PEOPLE DURING THOSE EVENTS THAT WE DON'T WANT TO MOVE- YOU KNOW MY EXPERIENCE IS GOING THROUGH. THESE HEAT WAVES IS THE- YOU KNOW THE MOST ON THE PEOPLE THE PEOPLE WHO YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO GO GET IN THE CAR OR HAVE TO WORK ACROSS A- LONG PARKING LOT YOU KNOW WALKING WITH. YOU KNOW WIFE ACROSS- EVEN JUST LIKE. THE SMALL PARKING STRUCTURE OF BLACKTOP YOU KNOW YOU EVEN IN THAT THAT DID A MOMENT YOU YOU'RE THINKING IS THIS GOING TO TRIGGER SOMETHING. AND IT'S THOSE EXPERIENCES OF MOVING YOURSELF ACROSS. SPECIALTIES LARGE URBAN INTERFACES THAT GETS COMPLICATED OBVIOUSLY AND FARMWORKER COMMUNITIES OR OTHER RURAL AREAS IT'S A DIFFERENT PUZZLE BUT- CAN YOU JUST COMMENT A LITTLE BIT ON. EXTREME HEAT. AND IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT BUT THIS BUT SPECIFICALLY IN PEOPLE'S HOMES SO BOTH MULTI FAMILY. AND IN HOMES. WHAT WHAT CAN WE DO TO IDENTIFY THOSE POPULATIONS BETTER WHO NEEDS HELP. AND WHAT TOOLS DO WE HAVE FOR THEM TO MITIGATE THAT RISK WITHOUT LEAVING THEIR HOUSE. THANKS I'LL TAKE A FIRST CUT IN AND OPEN TO DOING TARA I THINK. THAT I AM NOT GOING TO COMMENT ON WHAT WE HAVE IN PLACE TO IDENTIFY THOSE FOLKS I WOULD JUST SAY THAT- YOU KNOW THAT PROBABLY FALLS INTO THE CATEGORY OF. WORK THEIR COLLEAGUES THAT CAL YES. I DO AND DO WELL BUT I WILL SAY THAT THE FOCUS ON PEOPLE'S HOMES IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO THE ADMINISTRATION- THERE'S A SUITE OF PROPOSALS. RECOMMENDED ACTIONS IN THE DRAFT ACTION PLAN- AND IT'S HELPFUL TO HEAR THAT IS AN IMPORTANT AREA OF FOCUS FOR YOU ALL BECAUSE- AS WE NOTED YOU DON'T WORK WE'RE LISTENING TO FEEDBACK AND WE'RE DOING OUR VERY BEST TO INCORPORATE IT- YOU KNOW WE'VE- MADE VERY CLEAR IN OUR PROPOSAL LAST YEAR THAT. THE FUNDING FOR LIFE WHICH WAS INTENDED TO AND IN AREAS THAT WERE AVAILABLE TO EXTREME HEAT. TO DO THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY UPGRADES TO PEOPLE'S HOMES IN A WAY THAT UTILIZES. AT FOR EXAMPLE- HEAT PUMPS SUCH THAT PEOPLE CAN HAVE ACCESS BOTH THE HEAT AND ADD TO AIR CONDITIONING WHEN NECESSARY- WE HAVE A- ROBUST FOR. THE EXISTING CLIMATE CHANGE BUDGET FOCUSED ON SCALING AT THE DISSEMINATION OF HEAT PUMPS. INTO WELCOME COMMUNITIES AND THE FOCUS ON WHERE PEOPLE. IS AND CENTER FOR US SO WE WENT OUT BY MISTAKE. ONE THING I WOULD ADD THAT IS THIS TO THAT ACT THAT ARE THAT AMOUNT JUST WENT THROUGH- IN TERMS OF INVEST IN BILL THIS AND ARE- ALSO VERY FOCUSED. THAT IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES- AND THE SUPPORT SYSTEMS AB THAT ALSO NEED TO BE IN PLACE AND ESPECIALLY THINKING ABOUT HOW WE TARGET THOSE TO THE MOST VULNERABLE WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES- SO THAT IS DEFINITELY A PRIORITY FOR US AND IS REFLECTED THROUGHOUT THE ACTION PLAN BUT ABSOLUTELY LOOKING FORWARD TO. CONTINUED INPUT AND DISCUSSION ON. WAYS WHERE WE CAN BE PROVIDING. THAT SUPPORT. COMMUNITIES PEOPLE. THANKS FOR THE FEEDBACK AND I KNOW WE'LL DIG INTO A NUMBER OF OTHER ISSUES I APPRECIATE YOU- DELVING INTO THAT ONE ELEMENT THIS IS A MULTI HEADED HYDRA THIS HEAT EPIDEMIC- BUT- WILL DIG DEEPER IN IF ANY OTHER MEMBERS HAVE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS WE WANT TO KEEP THINGS MOVING IF YOU ALL AS THE ADMINISTRATION I KNOW YOU WILL BE HAVE SOME REPRESENTATIVES AS WELL ON THE LAST PANEL BUT- I'M HOPEFULLY TODAY'S HEARING ALSO HELPS. ELEVATE SOME OF THESE FEEDBACK FOR YOU SO YOU CAN INFORM YOUR DECISION AND WE CAN HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT NOT JUST THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION ALSO FROM LAST YEAR BUT LOOKING FORWARD WE KNOW THIS IS AN ELEMENT OF THE GOVERNOR'S CURRENT BUDGET AS WELL AND WE'LL LET THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEES TO DIG DEEPER INTO THE NUMBERS BUT- WE DO APPRECIATE YOU PUTTING THIS FORWARD AND WORKING WITH OUR COMMITTEE- WITH THAT. LET'S LET'S TURN TO OUR SECOND PANEL- WE'RE WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT THE HUMAN COST OF HEAT. SPECIFICALLY IN THE RISK AND VULNERABILITY THAT. A DEPUTY DIRECTOR KEY WAS TALKING ABOUT AT THE END THERE WITH. DEPUTY SECRETARY HANSON IN TERMS OF IDENTIFYING POPULATIONS AND REALLY TRYING TO MEET THEM WHERE THEY ARE- SO FIRST UP. WE HAVE. I SHALL DESCRIBE ALL THE WITNESSES JUST AT THE GATES AND THEN AND THEN I'LL INTRODUCE OUR FIRST WITNESS. SO- LET ME GO THROUGH. SO IN THIS IN THIS HUMAN IMPACTS PANEL WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM A NUMBER OF EXPERTS SOME OF WHOM HAVE GONE SO FAR AS BUILDING THE MODELS TO ACTUALLY IDENTIFY THESE IMPACTS OR- LOOK AT THE EVERYTHING DOWN FROM IN HOME COOLING TO COOL ROOF AND WALL PERFORMANCE OF LAWRENCE BERKELEY LABS- WOMAN WHO ACTUALLY HAS BEEN A WAREHOUSE WORKER AT AMAZON IS GOING THROUGH OUR OWN VERY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH HEAT- REPRESENTATIVE A ROOM IMPORTANT COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION THAT. LOOKING AT WHAT THE REAL IN IMPASSES ARE IN PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY AND WORKING DIRECTLY WITH WORKERS AND COMMUNITIES I COUNTY REPRESENTED TO GIVE US SOME INSIGHT ON HOW VULNERABILITY MAPPING IS ACTUALLY GETTING MORE GRANULAR AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND BUILT INTO THEIR SUSTAINABILITY PLANS BUT TO START OFF WE WANT TO GO TO JONATHAN PARR FREE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CLIMATE RESOLVE. WHO HAS BEEN MY HEAT EVANGELIST AND TURN ME AND MY EYES AND IN MY WORK ON CLIMATE ADVOCACY SQUARELY ON THIS ISSUE AND WE'RE DEEPLY INDEBTED TO HIM FOR GETTING HIS INCREDIBLE ORGANIZATION TO NOT JUST ADVOCATE BUT BACK IT UP WITH REAL SCIENCE AND REAL POLICY SO MISS PARKER YOU WANNA KICK THINGS OFF FOR US AND GIVE US A LITTLE OVERVIEW HERE ON. ON THIS THIS VERY HUMAN COST. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATORS. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE A GREETINGS FROM DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES. YOU KNOW PSYCHOLOGISTS SAY THAT AN AUDIENCE CAN ONLY RETAIN ONE OR TWO ITEMS FROM THE SPEECH AND SO WITH THAT IN MIND. I'M JUST GOING FOR ONE THE CONCEPT WHICH I THINK IS AT THE HEART. OF CALIFORNIA'S EXTREME HEAT EMERGENCY. ACCORDING TO THE RENOWNED HEAT SCIENTISTS HERSHAM ON HARI. THE EARTH. IN ITS PRE INDUSTRIAL STATE REFLECTED ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THE SUN'S ENERGY INTO SPACE AND IN TECHNICAL TERMS. POINT THREE THREE S. R. SOLAR REFLECTANCE. ZOOM AHEAD TO TODAY AND THE WAY THAT WE'VE BUILT OUR CITIES AND CON TOWARD OUR LANDSCAPE. WHICH HAS PROFOUNDLY REDUCED- THE EARTH'S SOLAR REFLECTANCE IN. CALIFORNIA WE HAVE ABOUT WORK. HUNDRED MILLION LANE MILES OF ROADS IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE ROADS. ARE COVERED IN BLACK ASPHALT. ASPHALT HAS A SOLAR REFLECTANCE OF. POINT. ZERO FIVE. IT'S SO HOUSEHOLD IS TIMES MORE- SO. OF THIS. THEN THE **** REFLECTED WOULD BE AN **** ABSORBS SUN'S DURING THE DAY AND RELEASE IT. INTO NAY AT NIGHT AND DR TELL US THAT THE HUMAN BODY NEEDS TIME AT NIGHT TO RECOVER FROM THE DAY'S EXPOSURE TO EXTREME HEAT AND YET THE WAY WE BUILT OUR CITIES AND ROOFTOPS IT ROBS MANY CALIFORNIANS OF. THAT ABILITY TO RECOVER. CALIFORNIA ALSO HAS TWELVE MILLION HOMES IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE HOMES ARE COVERED WITH ASPHALT SHINGLES THAT ABSORBS THE SUN'S ENERGY AND VENTILATE THROUGH INTO THE LIVING QUARTERS. SO LEGISLATORS IT'S WITHIN YOUR POWER TO HELP STOP CALIFORNIA FROM BEING SO MALADAPTIVE. NEW MODERN SOCIETY WE DID IT WITH THE BEST INTENTIONS BUT IT IS A VAST GEOENGINEERING EXPERIMENTS THAT WE NEED TO FIX- WE NEED TO CORRECT OUR BUILT ENVIRONMENTS AND WE TURN OUR CITIES TO THE CORRECT BALANCE OF REFLECTING SUNLIGHT. THANKFULLY WE HAVE TOOLS THAT WE CAN USE TO CALL CALIFORNIA. ONE AGREES HAS BEEN WERE WITH THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES IN OUR ORGANIZATION CAN TAKE SOME SMALL CREDIT FOR THE CITY NOW HAVING OVER SIXTY THOUSAND RUPEES THANK USE REFLECTIVE SHINGLES AND OVER A HUNDRED CITY BLOCKS THAT NOW HAVE COLD PAVEMENT AND OVER SIXTY. LA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT PLAYGROUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE COOLER MORE COLORFUL BY COVERING ASPHALT WITH REALLY COOL MATERIALS. IMPORTANT STUDY BY UCLA'S IN THE GOOS MON FOUND THAT HI EL MEDIO STRATEGY REFLECTING SUNLIGHT COUPLED WITH MORE TREES COULD REDUCE AIR TEMPERATURES BY THREE POINT SIX DEGREES FAHRENHEIT ENOUGH TO MAKE A LIFE OR DEATH DIFFERENCE FOR HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE. AND THIS STRATEGY COULD ALSO DELAY THE WARMING EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN LOS ANGELES FOR TWENTY FIVE TO SIXTY YEARS SO SENATORS AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND YOU HAVE THE YOU CAN HELP REBALANCE THE STATE'S SOLAR REFLECTIVE BUDGET. AND HELP WITH THAT BROADER TASK OF COOLING BY BRINGING PRE HAZARD MITIGATION FOCUS TO FUNDING RESILIENCE. HUBS BEING ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER IN OUR ESPECIALLY IN OUR- INCREASE CAL OSHA'S IN. STAFF PROTECT WORKERS IN BY TASK LOCAL HEALTH TO DO JOB OF GATHERING DATA ON HEAT RELATED DEATH AND HOSPITALIZATION. THE ADMINISTRATION'S EXTREME HEAT ACTION PLAN IT'S BEEN A FANTASTIC START JUST AMAZING AND ALSO MAJOR THANKS GOES TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER LUIS REDRESS FOR CHANTING SUCH COOL SOLUTIONS. AND YET. WITH THE STATE'S APPROACH IN ITS FRAMEWORK IT'S KIND OF A SO MUCH IS THERE IT'S AN ALPHABET SOUP IT'S A LOT TO MANAGE AND WITH AN ALPHABET SOUP IT IS WITHIN YOUR LEGISLATIVE- KARONGA. TO ARRANGE THOSE ALPHABET PIECES INTO WORDS PARAGRAPHS AND LEGISLATION AND TO FORM A REALLY INTEGRATED AND EFFECTIVE COOLING PROGRAM AT THE STATE AND I HOPE WILL BREAK CASF. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR CHEN IN THE CHOI. MISTER PAR FREE- NEXT UP I WANT TO WELCOME KRISTIN TAURUS CALLING- WHO IS LOS ANGELES COUNTY SUSTAINABILITY DIRECTOR- AND HAS PUT A HEARD LABORING OVER INTO THE WATER ON BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY PLAN AND- KALD R. COUNTY THAT THEY REALLY EMERGE FROM A TWENTY NINETEEN DOCUMENT BUT IS TAKING SHAPE IN BEEN. DRILLING DOWN ON THIS ISSUE EVER SINCE- THIS POLLING DO YOU WANT TO. OFFER LITTLE INSIGHT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE STATE'S LAREST COUNTY. YES CERTAINLY THANK YOU CHAIR STERN. THANKS FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY. GREETINGS ON VICE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- LIKE THE SENATOR SIGNED MY NAME IS KRISTEN BORIS CALLING HIM A SUSTAINABILITY PROGRAM DIRECTOR THE COUNTY CHIEF SUSTAINABILITY OFFICE AND- VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY DISCUSS WHAT OUR TEAM CALLED THE SILENT KILLER. AT EXTREME HEAT. THE LAST YEAR I TESTIFIED BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE TO DISCUSS WHAT WAS OPPENHEIMER FORTHCOMING VOTER ASSESSMENT. WHICH EXAMINES COMMUNITY SCALE CLIMATE VULNERABILITIES FOR ALL CORNERS OF LA. WE'VE SINCE COMPLETED THAT ASSESSMENT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH SEVERAL OTHER ORGANIZATIONS HERE TODAY AND I'LL SHARE OUR FINDINGS RELATED TO EXTREME HEAT. SO EXTREME HEAT WILL HAVE WIDESPREAD EFFECTS ON PEOPLE AND INFRASTRUCTURE INCREASING BOTH IN FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY ACROSS L. A. COUNTY WITH UP TO A TEN FOLD INCREASE. IN THE OCCURRENCE OF HEAT WAVES BY MID CENTURY. WE EXPECTS THE LARGEST INCREASES IN EXTREME HEAT IN THE SANTA CLARITA AND SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. NO EXTREME HEAT CAN JEOPARDIZE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH IN MANY WAYS JUST SOME EXAMPLES WORSENING RESPIRATORY AND HEART CONDITIONS AND THAT'S WHY WE AS A COUNTY TAKE THIS ISSUE SERIOUSLY. THE NEXT THING HE WILL ALSO HAVE MONUMENTAL AND COMPLEX IMPACTS WERE ENERGY SYSTEM AND OTHER PIECES OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SAME GONNA FOCUS ON OUR SOCIAL VULNERABILITIES TO EXTREME HEAT IN OTHER WORDS THE PEOPLE WHO WILL BE MOST DISTRESSED BY EXTREME HEAT. TO DO THAT WE CONSIDERED IN OUR REPORT TWENTY NINE SOCIAL FACTORS WHICH WE CROSSWALKS WITH CLIMATE DATA AT THE CENSUS TRACTS FAILED TO IDENTIFY COMMUNITIES OF CONCERN FOR EXTREME HEAT. WE ARE HIGHLY CONCERNED ABOUT COMMUNITIES LIKE RECEITA AND WINNETKA IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. SHOP HIGH PROPORTIONS OF LIMITED ENGLISH HOUSEHOLDS IN PEOPLE WITH PRE EXISTING HEALTH CONDITIONS. OUR REPORT ALSO HIGHLIGHTED MONTEBELLO. WHICH IS AT RISK OF EXPOSURE TO EXTREME HEAT PLUS. COPULATION IS MADE UP OF A HIGH PROPORTION OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND THE VEHICLE ACCESS. WE ALSO LIFT UP HE'S STILL LAYING IN SOUTH EAST LA WHERE URBAN HEAT ISLAND EFFECT CAN MAGNIFY IMPACTS EVEN WHEN THERE IS MODEST INCREASES IN REGIONAL TEMPERATURE. THE REPORT MAKES CLEAR THAT THERE'S A DISTINCTLY RACIALIZED ASPECTS TO CLIMB UPON ABILITIES IN MANY CASES. THE FOR EXTREME HEAT WE FOUND THAT LATINOS MAKE UP 49% OF LA COUNTY'S POPULATION THAT ENGINE UNITY IS WITH HIGHLY WITH HIGH **** ABILITY TO EXTREME HEAT. WE HAVE SIXTY SEVEN. OF THE POPULATION. SO THAT MEANS BUT THEN ALSO BEAR THE BRUNT OF EXTREME HEAT- IMPACTS. SUCH AS PRETERM BIRTH. NOT IN MY IS A STRIKE. AND JUST. A BUT NOT EXACTLY YOU NOT SURPRISING FINDING. OUR ASSESSMENT WAS THAT A CHECK OF SUCH LIKE HAVE A FULL SUITE OF RECOMMENDATIONS TO MAKE YOUR FOR YOU TODAY. INSTEAD WE SIMPLY WANT TO RAISE THE ALARM ABOUT THE INCREASING LIKELIHOOD OF EXTREME HEAT EMERGENCIES AND ASSURE THAT THERE ARE LITERALLY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKELY TO BE VULNERABLE TO BEES AND OTHER CRIME IN EMERGENCIES IN L. A. ALONE. FURTHER DOWN THE AGENDA OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE MCALLEN LEADS ARE OFFICE OF EVERITT MANAGEMENT. HE'LL GO INTO FURTHER EXTREME HEAT EMERGENCY WORK THAT THE COUNTY CONDUCTS THANK YOU- THANK YOU MISTER IS CALLING- IN FOR ALL YOUR TECHNICAL SUPPORT- AND PUTTING A SPOTLIGHT ON OUR COMMUNITIES- NEXT UP I WANNA INVITE NANCY'S INIGO. I WAS DIRECTOR OF THE WORKERS HEALTH PROGRAM FOR YOU SEE TO TOW THE IN THE CHRISTIANE POLITE DID SUED THE CALIFORNIA. AND ORGANIZATIONS BEEN PROVIDING HEALTH AND SAFETY EDUCATION ACCESS TO DAY LABORERS HOUSEHOLD WORKERS WORKING DIRECTLY WITH COMMUNITIES- SOME IS ANY GUIDE- THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US HERE TODAY. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE CHAIRED BY SCARE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY I PLAN TO SHARE WITH EXTREME HEAT IN THE HOME ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE. FOR ONE OR MORE WORKERS- MY NAME IS NANCY SUNY NINE AS MENTIONED I'VE LET THE WORKERS HEALTH PROGRAM- FOR EIGHT YEARS WE FACILITATE HEALTH AND SAFETY TRAINING. AND SUPPORT DISASTER PREPAREDNESS AND RECOVERY EFFORTS FOR DALY RESENT THE MASTIC WORKERS YES GUYS AND LOS ANGELES BASED WORKERS CENTER SERVING MOSTLY LATINO IMMIGRANT. MONOLINGUAL SPANISH SPEAKERS THAT COMMUTE ON PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. EXPOSURE TO EXTREME HEAT HAS BECOME UNFORTUNATELY PART OF THE JOB WHERE IMMIGRANT WORKERS ARE HAVING TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THEIR HEALTH AND BARELY MAKING ENDS MEET ON MOST DAYS OF THE YEAR. THE LEVERS DO OUTDOOR WORK LIKE GENERAL LABOR CONSTRUCTION OR GARDENING IN PRIVATE HOMES FOR MINIMAL A MINIMAL IF. HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTECTIONS DURING HOT WEATHER EXPERIENCE WORKERS ANTICIPATING NEEDING TO CARRY THEIR OWN DRINKING WATER AND SECURING WORK EARLIER IN THE MORNINGS TO AVOID HEAT EXHAUSTION. MANY WORKERS TAKE THEIR OWN HEALTH AND SAFETY PRECAUTIONS AS A RESULT THE PAST HOSPITALIZATIONS OR GETTING INJURED ON THE JOB OR EMPLOYERS HAVE FAILED TO PROVIDE PROTECTIONS. THESE IMMIGRANT WORKERS ARE OFTEN UNINSURED AND MORE LIKELY TO BE LIVING WITH CHRONIC DISEASES THAT ARE OFTEN UNTREATED MAKING SOMETHING LIKE EXTREME HEAT A DEADLY WORK HAZARD. FOR THESE REASONS WE RECOMMEND THE FOLLOWING. AT REMOVING COLUSA EXCLUSION OF THOSE THAT WORK AND PRIVATE HOMES DOING DOMESTIC. WORK LIKE GARDENING AND CLEANING. THE MASTER WORK WHETHER IT BE MAD LABOR OR GIVING AND SOME TOLD. REQUIRES IN AND OUTDOOR ACT. EXTREME HEAT OFTEN. EXISTING WORK HAZARDS DOMESTIC WORKERS HAVE BECOME ILL WHILE GOING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN CLEANING AND AIR CONDITIONED WHOM AND WHILE FAT WHILE FIRE ASHES FROM SOMEONE'S BACK YOU. OTHER IN ENOUGH TIME FOR WORKERS BODIES TO FULLY ACCLIMATE TO TEMPERATURE CHANGES. ANOTHER CHANGE THAT IS NEEDED LANGUAGE AND CULTURAL ACCESSIBLE EDUCATION OUTREACH THAT MATCHES GEOGRAPHIC IMPACT NOT ENOUGH IS BEING DONE TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS AN INFRASTRUCTURE TO COMMUNICATE WITH NON ENGLISH SPEAKING COMMUNITIES. MARKHAM COLLABORATION WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND LOCAL ETHNIC MEDIA THAT DISSEMINATES INFORMATION ABOUT RESOURCES IS NEEDED COMMUNICATION RELYING ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND EMAIL DISMISSES A LARGE PART OF THE POPULATION THAT IS COMMUTING TO AND FROM WORK WITH LITTLE FONG RECEPTION. COMMUNICATION ACROSS HOTSPOTS WHERE LOW WAGE WORKERS TRAVEL TO AND FROM WORK ARE KEY AREAS TO SPREAD AWARENESS OF LOCAL RESOURCES TO PROTECT AGAINST EXTREME HEAT. RESOURCES INCLUDING COOLING CENTERS NEED TO BE ALLOCATED LOCALLY AND MAP ALONGSIDE PROJECTIONS OF WHERE EXTREME HEAT WILL CONTINUE TO DRASTIC RICE. LASTLY WE NEED TO APPLY A PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH TO EXTREME HEAT THIS APPROACH WILL LOOK MORE CLOSELY AT HOW SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH FACTOR INTO VULNERABILITY AND RESILIENCE WORKERS ARE AT RISK AT WORK BUT THEY'RE ALSO NOT FINDING RELIEF AT HOME. FOR EXAMPLE MANY WORKERS LIVE IN URBAN AREAS ARE ALSO VULNERABLE TO EXTREME HEAT OFTEN LIVING IN CROWDED OLDER BUILDINGS THAT LACK PROPER VENTILATION. ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND IMMIGRATION STATUS ALSO IMPACT THE WORKERS ABILITY TO PREVENT HEAT ILLNESS OR EVEN DEATH DURING EXTREME HEAT. ON BEHALF OF THE THAT'S KIND OF THOUSANDS OF WORKERS THAT WE SERVE WE ASK THAT THE BURDEN OF CLIMATE CHANGE NOT CONTINUE TO FALL UPON ALREADY WILL DOUBLE COMMUNITIES BUT RATHER THAT WE WORK TOGETHER ON A DATING AND BROADENING THE RESPONSE TO EXTREME HEAT AND OUR STATE. THAT TRULY RESOURCES HIGHLY IMPACTED COMMUNITIES WE LOOK FORWARD T CONTINUING. THIS CONVERSATION THANK YOU- THANK YOU MISTER MAKER- WE WILL CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION. FOR BEING SO CONNECTED TO THE GROUND THOUGH- LOST WELL KEEPING YOUR HEAD ON THESE POLICY SOLUTIONS TO MAKE IT A VERY CONCRETE WE DO APPRECIATE THAT- NEXT UP WE HAVE. MARIANA STRADA- WHO IS- ACTUALLY- I'VE BEEN ONE OF THOSE MEMBERS WORK FORCE OUT THERE. I'M DOING THE WORK AND- I MISS IS THAT EITHER WE APPRECIATE YOU COMING TO US TO TELL YOUR STORY- AND WE WELCOME YOU TO. THE JOINT COMMITTEE. EVERYONE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE TODAY MY NAME IS MONEY AND THE S. PLAN AND I AM A GRADUATE STUDENT AT UCLA STUDYING URBAN AND REGIONAL PLANNING. I ALSO WORK WITH JONATHAN PARK FREE ACT FINALLY RESOLVED BUT BEFORE I WAS WITH CLAMOR RESOLVED I WORKED AS THE- AT AN AMAZON WAREHOUSE IN MORENO VALLEY WHICH IS A SMALL CITY IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. AND AS A KICKER I WOULD HAVE EXPANDED THAT TIME ME EXACTLY WHAT ROLE AND HOW FAR DOWN THE ROAD TO GO. TO GET THE ITEMS FOR THE ORDER I WAS DEALING AND LOOKING FLOOR IS INCREDIBLY LARGE THERE MUST BE AT LEAST A. HUNDRED ROLES THAT WE ARE PICKING FROM. AND THE TYPE OF CLAIM THAT AMAZON HAD. TO US. WHEN IT COMES OF. A COUPLE OF. ON EVERY WORLD SO THERE WOULD BE TIMES WHEN WE WOULD BE PICKING ITEMS. SEVERAL MINUTES WITHOUT ANY COOLING AT ALL. AND SINCE I WAS WORKING THERE DURING THE SUMMER TIMES. WHEN I WOULD CLOCK IN THE MORNING IT WOULD ALREADY BE WARM SHIP IT WAS EVEN HOTTER- AND THROUGHOUT THE SHIFT FOR CONSTANTLY ON THE MOVE AND ENCOURAGED TO MOVE FASTER IN ORDER TO ME OUR HOURLY RATE- AND WE'RE WALKING UP TO SEVERAL MILES- IN THE ORKDAY AND THAT HE EVENTUALLY STARTS TO GET TO YOU. THE PHARMACIST AND THE BLOWING HOT AIR BACK TO YOU WHICH CAN FEEL WORSE AT TIMES. AND THERE WERE MANY TIMES WHEN I FELT SO HOT AND UNCOMFORTABLE TO THE POINT WHERE I FELT DIZZY. IT'S SO HOT AND YOU'RE THERE FOR. AT LEAST TEN HOURS BECAUSE THAT'S THE AVERAGE SHIFT TIME. AND THE WAY I DESCRIBE THE HEAT AT AMAZON IS IF YOU'RE IF YOU IMAGINE YOURSELF SHOPPING AT A WAREHOUSE TYPE OF STORES LIKE WALMART. BUT WITH NO AIR CONDITIONING AND YOU HAVE TO MOVE VERY FAST AND YOU'RE STUCK THERE FOR A VERY LONG TIME. AND WHEN YOU START WORKING AT AMAZON THERE ARE VIDEOS ON SAFETY THAT YOU HAVE TO WATCH ON HOW TO PICK UP THE BOX PROPERLY- BUT THERE IS NO INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE SYMPTOMS OF HEAT ILLNESS LOOK LIKE. OR WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU ARE EXPERIENCING THEM ALL THE WORKERS HAVE. ARE THOSE SMALL FANS ON EVERY OTHER I DON'T. THINK YOU. M. THANK YOU FOR CONSOLIDATING WHAT'S- HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF HOURS OF EXPERIENCE INTO. THREE SHORT MINUTES- BUT YOUR TESTIMONY IS- MAY HAVE BEEN BRIEF BUT IT'S WELL HEARD BY THE COMMITTEE AND WE APPRECIATE YOU MRS THAT OTHER- NOW WE HAVE. TO THE LEADING EXPERTS IN THE IN THE COUNTRY JOINING US FROM LAWRENCE BERKELEY NATIONAL LABS- RUNNING LEVINSON IS THE LEADER OF THE HEAT ISLAND GROUP. AND MAX WAY WHO- IS IT NEXT PART ON- H. FAQ STANDARDS IN A HEAT VULNERABILITY X. INDEX THAT HE'S GONNA BE TALKING US THROUGH. AND ALSO A FORMER CLASSMATE OF MINE AND UC BERKELEY SAYS A VERY- VERY WELCOME- PRESENCE ON OUR PANEL HERE TO SEE- WHAT THE SMARTEST PEOPLE I KNEW CAL DIGGING DEEP INTO THIS COMPLEX ISSUE. SO- MISTER LEVINSON YOU WANT IT DOCUMENTS AND YOU WANT TO GET STARTED HERE AND THEN WE'LL TURN IT DR WAY. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR YEAH COMMITTEE SPEAK TO TODAY. BOB I READ THE HEAT ISLAND GROUP THAT WORKS BERKELEY NATIONAL LABORATORY WHERE WE TRY TO KEEP OUR PEOPLE AND OUR BUILDINGS AND WHOLE CITIES ARE COOLER IN HOT PLACES POINTS THE FIRST IS THAT HEAT ISLAND COUNTERMEASURES AND THESE ARE STEPS LIKE USING COOL ROOFS OR MORE RECENTLY COOL WALLS. FOR SHADE TREES AND A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS OUGHT THEY WILL PROVIDE FAIL SAFE COOLING DURING HEATWAVES MEANING THEY DON'T DEPEND ON THE AVAILABILITY OF ELECTRICITY. AND THEY CAN BE FIVE TO TEN TIMES MORE EFFECTIVE INDOORS THAN OUTSIDE THESE MEASURES ARE GREAT FOR LOWERING THE OUTSIDE AIR TEMPERATURE IN THE CITY. BUT BECAUSE THEY- ALL THE CIRCUS OF OUR HOMES EITHER BY REFLECTING MORE SUNLIGHT OR PREVENTING SUNLIGHT FROM REACHING OUR HOMES THROUGH SHADE. THEY HAD EVEN GREATER BENEFITS AND THIS IS A VERY VALUABLE THING BECAUSE OUR HEAT WAVES ARE OFTEN COINCIDENT WITH POWER FAILURES SO- THAT IT'S THE FIRST POINT LIKE TO SHARE. THE SECOND IS THAT I WORK A LOT WITH THE BUILDING STANDARDS IN CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE TITLE TWENTY FOUR PART SIX WHICH IS OUR ENERGY STANDARD IN TITLE TWENTY FOUR PART ELEVEN WHICH USE OUR GREEN BUILDING STANDARD. THESE ARE EXCELLENT STANDARDS- BUT THEY FOCUS ON ENERGY SAVINGS CARBON SAVINGS AND COST SAVINGS ALL VERY WORTHWHILE OBJECTIVES. BUT AS WE ARE DEVELOPING. PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS EXTREME HEAT THOSE NEED TO BE BASED ON HUMAN OUTCOMES AND THAT MEANS THAT STANDARDS NEED TO RECOGNIZE THE VALUE OF REDUCING DEATH ILLNESS AND MISERY. SO WE WANT TO REWARD IMPROVEMENTS TO THERMAL COMFORT SEVERAL SAFETY TO COMFORT AND TO PRODUCTIVITY. AND THE FINAL POINT IS WHILE CALIFORNIA IS IN THE COMING YEARS GOING TO MISS EXTENSIONAL INVESTMENTS TO ADDRESS EXTREME HEAT THAT'S NOT THE END OF THE STORY AND AS CALIFORNIA MAKES INVESTMENTS IN THESE PROGRAMS IT SHOULD DEDICATE RESOURCES TO MONITORING THEIR OUTCOMES. THAT IS TO SAY WHAT'S LEARN WHAT WORKS BY MEASURING REDUCTIONS IN TEMPERATURE SHE STRESSED THE ONUS HOSPITALIZATIONS AND DEATHS AND WHAT'S- MEASURE THE IMPROVEMENTS TO HEALTH COMFORT PRODUCTIVITY AND LEARNING AND THIS I THINK ARE THE WAYS THAT WE CAN TAKE STRONG STEPS TOWARDS DEVELOPING EXTREME HEAT COUNTERMEASURES THAT ARE WILL BENEFIT ALL CALIFORNIANS WILL BE EFFECTIVE AND CAN GUIDE OUR FUTURE INVESTMENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU DR- NEXT UP. MISTER WAY. YES THANK YOU SO MUCH KNOWN SENATOR STERN AND- THANK YOU TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ ANOTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THANK YOU FOR THE KIND WORDS SENATOR STERN- SO GO GO BEARS HOLDEN HALLS. TODAY OKAY SHARING FROM- PROJECT CALDERON SO STANCE CALIFORNIA KIT OR TO IT GOING UNDER ENVIRONMENTS. AND HE- TO OKAY WORD OF- COMMUNITY INPUT AND- S. BELOW. THE PROJECT IS BAY IN FRANCE. AND IS FOR ON HOMES PRESIDENT HOME. AND HE RESULTING TOOLKIT I DON'T. OUTPUT INCLUDE SEVERAL AND INCLUDING SHEETS. MODELING A COUPON IN TOOL AND PROGRAM RIGHT. SO WE FIND SEVERAL CHAEBOL. IN FRESNO IN ON FRANCE WHICH ARE DE AREAS OVER SEVENTY PER ARE UNCOMFORTABLE HOT AT HOME VERY OFTEN DURING THE SUMMER AND RESIDENTS ON THE TOP FLOORS AND THOSE RESIDENTS AND UNITSTHAT LACK AIR CONDITIONING WHICH IS ABOUT FIFTEEN PERCENT. ARE SPECIALLY VULNERABLE THERE A LOT OF OLDER INEFFICIENT AIR CONDITIONERS THEM UP ON SOME SOFT COOLERS WITHOUT IN UNITS WITHOUT INTRODUCED. THE FINES MEASURE ARE PARTICULAR AFFECTED. ON SOME OF THE PARA MEASURE ARE STILL HERE WINDOW. ROOF INSULATION. AND COOL ARE TO BE THE MOST OF PASSIVE MEASURES THAT DON'T ENERGY- OVERALL. AND NATURAL. OR OLD YOUR WINDOW DURING THE EVENING. ADDRESS COOLER. IT'S PAST FOR TOP IN THE- PLOT OF THE MEXICO TO ME. IN SOUTHWEST FRESNO. WHILE I'M ON THE WIRES IS A METRIC DISCOMFORT OUR AND ON ACCESS IS EACH OF THEM. THAT WERE MÀ. THAT'S JUST SHOWING THE NATURAL COOL WINDOW FOR ARE. ARE PROMISING MEASURES. SO IN TERMS OF RECORD. THE FIRST IS THE WE NEED MORE. EQUITABLE DEFINITIONS FOR EXTREME HEAT AND HEAT WAVES SO TWENTY TWENTY ONE THERE WERE A RECORD NUMBER OF DAYS GREATER THAN A HUNDRED DEGREES FAHRENHEIT IN FRESNO AT SIXTY NINE WHICH EXCEEDS THE PROJECTION FOR TWENTY FORTY THEIR NINETEEN HUESO GREATER THAN A HUNDRED DEGREES SHOWN BELOW. BUT ONLY SIXTEEN OF THE SIXTY NINE DAYS OVER CLASSIFIED AS EXTREME HEAT DAYS BY THE STATE'S DEFINITION OF EXTREME HEAT AND ONLY ONE OF THE NINE WAVES IS COUNTED AS A HEAT WAVE USING THAT EXTREME HEAT DEFINITION. EXTREMELY TECH THRESHOLD IS A HUNDRED SIX DEGREES FAHRENHEIT FRESNO INVARIANTS BY CLIMATE IT'S BASED ON HISTORICAL NINETIETH PERCENTILE. LEVELS SO I THINK WE SHOULD CONSIDER ABSOLUTE THRESHOLDS IN ADDITION TO LOCATION DEPENDENT THRESHOLDS FOR EXTREME. HEAT AND HEAT WAVES IMPROPER TO ENSURE ADEQUATE IN EXISTING FOR LOW INCOME AND- AREAS WITH PRINT. WILL BUILDING SO THIS JUST. IS SHOWING ABOUT EIGHTY PER OF THE AND SO FRANCE WE'RE BUILT IN EIGHTY AND ARE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES WE NEED TO FIND OF MECHANISMS OTHER THAN BUILDING CODES. ARTICLE THESE EXISTING BUILDINGS FOR EXAMPLE EXPANDING EXISTING WEATHERIZATION PROGRAMS REQUIRING ADEQUATE COOLING ON POINT OF SALE HOMES. AND REQUIRING COOLING EQUIPMENT INSPECTION DURING OTHER HOME INSPECTION. OR OTHER OPPORTUNITIES WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO. FINALLY WE NEED TO PINE. AND THEN. THESE PASSIVE ENACT COOLING. THAT'S GONNA MENTION TO DETERMINE WHAT WORKS BEST FOR RESIDENTS AND TO DEVELOP BEST PRACTICES. FOR INSPECTION IMPLEMENTATION AND MONITORING AND JUST A FEW EXAMPLES OF SOME OF THE HIGH TECH MEASURES. HELLO ON. SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR ATTENTION ON THERE IS A WEBSITE THAT'S JUST COMING UP CALDERON SORT OF RELIGION BE THAT HAS LONG DISCIPLINE PERMISSION. AND I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ON THE SEC CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH PROGRAM FOR THEIR SUPPORT IN A RESEARCH FUNDING HELLO WEST FRESNO FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER IN THE SHIP CONSULTING AND USC. THANK YOU JOHN. AT THANK YOU DR WAY AND- WE DO APPRECIATE THE ENTIRE LABS THE SERVICE TO NOT JUST THIS COMMITTEE BUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- AND THE ACUITY WITH WHICH YOU ANALYZE THE ISSUE ACTUALLY GIVES US A LOT OF INSIGHT AND TOOLS FOR MOVING FORWARD- THAT'S THE DECK INCLUDES THE INITIAL REMARKS FROM OUR PANELISTS DID ANY MEMBERS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS THAT THEY WANTED TO ASK I'M HAPPY TO OPEN IT UP FOR A MOMENT HERE- IF THERE ARE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS I DID WANT TO ASK- ONE. ONE QUESTION ABOUT THE I THINK FOR OUR OUR LAWRENCE BERKELEY LABS FOLKS- IN TERMS THE HEAT RANKING SYSTEM THAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT AND- ANALYZING HE SORT OF OUTSIDE OF THE HOME VERSES IN THE HOME- HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY FIGURE OUT WHAT. THE TEMPERATURE IS INSIDE OF HOMES AND WHERE THOSE DISPARITIES ARE IDENTIFYING WHERE THEIR SWAMP COOLERS OR WHERE THERE ARE NOT TEN HOW TO MAP THAT IN A WAY YOU MEAN WHEN YOU LOOK AT FOR INSTANCE WHAT L. A. COUNTY STATED THAT THEY ACHIEVED THROUGH THE VULNERABILITY INDEX ENOUGH FOR. TO SEARCH OF. TARGET THE POPULATIONS THAT THEY WILL NEED THAT ASSISTANCE TO THE AREAS THAT NEED. MOST URGENTLY SAY FOR THE URBAN HEAT ISLAND TO BE BROKEN UP OR NEED A COOL ROOF RETROFIT OR NEED NEW URBAN GREENING OPPORTUNITIES I MEAN. TAKE THERE'S LIMITLESS NEED HERE BUT IN TERMS OF PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK AND THE KIND OF DATA WE NEED TO COST EFFECTIVELY ATTACK THIS PROBLEM HOW DO YOU- HOW DO YOU BUILD. ENOUGH GRANULARITY TO THE DATA TO MAKE SURE WE'RE WE'RE REACHING THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT MOST FIRST. WOULD YOU LIKE TO START SURE YEAH THAT'S SOME THE GREAT WESTERN US SENATOR STERN AND I THINK HER SEVERAL COMPONENTS OF IT SO I'M NOT SURE THAT I COULD DO IT JUSTICE MIDDLE TO START AND THEN- RUNNING CAN RESPOND AS WELL SO. I THINK ON THE FIRST POINT YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT- METRICS AND YOU MENTIONED HE DID BACKS THERE'S A HUGE WARNING SYSTEM WHICH IS BEING PILOTED BY THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE THERE'S A LOT OF. NOW SOUP OF. METRICS OUT WHICH ARE LOOKING OUT OUTDOOR COMFORT OR HELP SEATING DECK OR OUTDOOR RISKS TO WORKERS. FROM COST IN OUR STUDENTS HOURS ON CRISTINA NEXT WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT HUMIDITY SO SOME THERE'S TEMPERATURE NUMBER ONE AND THEN THERE'S- OTHER METRICS WHICH INCLUDE HUMIDITY AND YOU CAN ALSO LOOK AT YOUR SPEED. AND ALSO LIKE A GRADIENT TEMPERATURE WHICH IS STILL IN A RADIATION FROM OTHER SERVICES. CAN ALSO CARRY INSIDE OF THE HOME SO. YOU'RE RIGHT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WE TYPICALLY TEND TO ENSURE OUTDOOR ALL. METRICS THAT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE WE ACCESS THOSE WE DON'T MEASURE ON. INDOOR CONDITIONS SUCH AS HUMIDITY AND AIRSPEED AND SO FORTH BUT WE DO KNOW THAT MANY FACTORS CAN IMPROVE YOUR COMFORT SUCH AS HAVING FAMILY. WHICH CAN IN TURN INCREASE AIRSPEED REDUCING THE HUMIDITY WITHIN THE HOME WHICH IS OPPOSITE OF WHAT IT'S LONGER WITH US. BUT AIR CONDITIONING ALSO. IT'S KIND OF ON YOU KNOW IT IMPROVING THE HUMIDITY IN YOUR HOME- SOMEONE ARE WORK IN OUR MODELING WORK WE DEFINITELY TRY TO. TAKE A LOT OF THESE FACTORS INTO ACCOUNT AND E TRY TO. LOOK AT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR- POTENTIAL MEASURES. BY A SERIES OF. BUT THE TECHNICAL COMFORT REALLY COMFORT AND HEALTH METRICS INCLUDING WELL I WON'T GO THROUGH ALL THE NAMES BUT THERE'S NOT THERE'S TO BE. SO FOR. ME JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE NO AND SO IT WENT HEARING FROM YOU YOU. YOU'RE YOU'RE GETTING A PRECISE ABOUT THE F. OF VERY MITIGATE MEASURE. BUT THE- STILL THAT SIR OF PRIORITIZATION. IN GETTING SOLID ENOUGH. DATA TO KNOW- IF LEAST YOU KNOW ROUGHLY WHERE THE ISSUE IS RIGHT I MEAN YOU YOU'VE IDENTIFIED- THE THIRTY AMBIENT TEMPERATURE ISSUES MAPPED OVER SAY INCOME OR DIFFERENT VULNERABILITY INDEX. AND THEN AT THAT POINT. YOU HAVE SOME BEST PRACTICES TO DEPLOY IN- AND THAT'S MAYBE WHERE GOVERNMENT STARTS TO COME IN AND START TO BUILD A LITTLE MORE. GRANULARITY BUT MY ONLY OTHER QUESTION THEN WAS FOR MISTER PAR FREE IN TERMS OF. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU CAN'T IDENTIFY EVERY SINGLE HOUSE AND WHAT THEIR INDIVIDUAL NEEDS ARE I KNOW. YOU'VE BEEN ADVOCATING AND TEEING UP SORT OF THOSE NO REGRETS MUCH LARGER COMMUNITY WIDE SOLUTIONS THAT. EVERYONE CAN BENEFIT FROM AND THERE'S BEEN SOME CONTROVERSY OR I GUEST- LIGHT SKEPTICISM MAYBE IS THE WAY TO OPPOSE IT NOW ABOUT. THINGS LIKE COOL ROOFS IN COOL PAVEMENT. AND SOME SOME SORT OFSUBTLE INDICATION MAYBE IT'S FROM THE ASPHALT INDUSTRY ABOUT SOME COLLATERAL EFFECTS FROM GOING THIS WAY BUT I DID WANT TO GIVE YOU. AN OPPORTUNITY TO LAY TO REST ANY OF THAT SKEPTICISM AND- JUST A LITTLE GIVE A LITTLE MORE- WITH A LITTLE MORE POINTEDNESS FOR THE COMMITTEE TO UNDERSTAND- THOSE ARE TO AMBIENT. ISSUES THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY TURN THE TEMPERATURE DOWN IN A COMMUNITY WITH- THAT YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO TURN YOUR AC TEMPERATURE DOWN. IT'S TURNED DOWN FOR YOU BECAUSE THERE'S A TREE ON YOUR STREET. AND IT'S NOT A GIANT. ASPHALT PARKING LOT RIGHT IN FRONT YOUR HOUSE BUT- BUT FOR ALL THE COOLING SKEPTICS OUT THERE JUST. WANTED. TO GIVE YOU A QUICK CHANCE TO RESPOND- THANK YOU SO- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE DON'T RECOGNIZE IS THAT THESE COOLING MATERIALS CAN BE MANUFACTURED. IN SUCH A WAY WHERE YOU NEARLY HI CAMP DOWN. ANY OF THE A GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THAT GOES INTO PRODUCING SO THAT'S THAT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT FACTS SO FOR EXAMPLE THE THREE M. COMPANY THAT RUNS ONLINE IN- CHINO- CALIFORNIA- THAT THEY PROCESS THEIR GRANULES THERE WITH A SOLAR POWER. AS A WAY OF HAVING A MORE- SORT OF HOLISTIC APPROACH TO REDUCING- THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM THEIR PRODUCTS AND IN TALKING WITH A NUMBER OF THE OTHER VENDORS WHO PRODUCED THE COOL PAVEMENT. REELS WHETHER IT'S THE GAF COMPANY- OR OTHERS- THAT ARE OUT THERE THE RECENT GREAT CALIFORNIA COMPANIES. AND THEY HAVE ASSURED ME THAT THEY CAN PRODUCE ALL OF THEIR PRODUCTS A USING RENEWABLE TECHNOLOGIES. TO POWER THE PROCESSING AND MANUFACTURING OF THOSE PRODUCTS- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT FOLKS DON'T REALIZE IS THAT WHEN YOU'RE WALKING ON THE SIDEWALK YOU'RE ON CONCRETE AND CONCRETE HAS THE SAME SOLAR REFLECTIVITY SAME AND IT'S AROUND TWENTY THREE THREE WHICH IS VERY PROPITIOUS BECAUSE THAT'S THE SAME AS A PRE INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY- SOLAR REFLECTANCE IN THE- THE MOON IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE SUN'S REFLECTION WHEN YOU'RE ON A SIDEWALK. WILL YOU WON'T LIKE IT WHEN YOU'RE ON THE STREET BUT I THINK MOST OF US ARE QUITE ACCLIMATED TO THAT DEGREE OF THE ALBEDO OF. SOLAR REFLECTIVE YES. BY WALKING ON A SIDEWALK SO THERE HAVE BEEN SOME- COMPLAINTS ABOUT THAT- THAT PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS OF THESE ARE PRODUCTS THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE HUSTLER REFLECTIVE OF PROPERTIES AND HOW IT MIGHT POTENTIALLY IN THE MOMENT MADE PEOPLE. A LITTLE BIT HARDER- BUT WE SIMPLY HAVEN'T FOUND THOSE TO BE INSURMOUNTABLE- OBSTACLES. TO A WIDESPREAD. EXPERIMENT WITH THE ONE MORE COOLING PRODUCT THAT'S OUT THERE THAT IS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR A LOS ANGELES AREA WHERE MOST OF THE COOLING PRODUCTS USE A FOREIGN THOUGHT TITANIUM. OF BASS- TITANIUM OXIDE BASE TITANIUM IS ESSENTIALLY BURKE LITTLE WHITE PIECES OF SAND THAT YOU MIGHT FIND ON THE BEACH IN YOUR AGGREGATING THEM ALL TOGETHER INTO ONE PLACE- AND THAT IS- USING OF BARITE. FORMED EIGHT. UNFORTUNATELY. TO DEATH. REFLECT IN THE U. B. AND IT ACTS CAN. TO A FORMING SMART AND SO OUR OUR GOAL IS TO HAVE THE RIGHT KIND OF TECHNOLOGY IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND WE DON'T WANT TO FOR MORE SMOG AND IN LOS ANGELES AND SO THE ERROR I BASED MATERIALS THAT ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN REFLECTING SUNLIGHT. MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR THE SOUTH COAST ON A QUEUE IN THE DISTRICT. SO FORGET MY LONG ANSWER BUT- THERE ARE THE RIGHT PRODUCTS FOR THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME AND I SHOULD ADD THAT ASSEMBLY COMBO- AND- WITH THE- AND CRESCENTS. NO THEY DO NOT NEED- THE COOLING REMEDIES THAT WE'RE SUGGESTING JUST THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE STATE WHERE THE PUBLIC RESIDES THOSE ARE THE PLACES THAT NEED THESE KINDS OF CORNERS- THANKS FOR THE INSIGHT AND- FOR LAYING OUT THAT SPECTRUM THAT NOT ALL COOLING TECHNOLOGIES ARE BUILT EQUAL NECESSARILY BUT ALSO THAT. THEY'RE THERE AND THEY'RE ON THE SHELF AND WE JUST HAVE TO GO GET THEM SO- LET'S TALK A LITTLE MORE ON THIS UPCOMING PANEL WAS THERE ANY QUESTIONS CENTER LIMÓN YOU WANT TO WIN QUICKLY PLEASE WELCOME. THANK YOU AND ONE QUICK QUESTION SORRY AS I WAS LISTENING TO THE COMMENTS THAT WERE BEING MADE WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT- YOU KNOW THE HE IN THE IMPACT FOR THE INDIVIDUALS AND HEARD TESTIMONIALS AND JUST BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE SOUTH COAST A. Q. M. D. WAS MENTIONED DO WE KNOW ANYTHING- I THINK OF COMMUNITIES LIKE WILMINGTON CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE THAT NOT ONLY SUFFER SOME OF THESE HEAT WAVES. BUT ALSO- HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO HAVE JUST POLLUTANTS IN THE AIR THAT ARE A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN OTHER COMMUNITIES DO WE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE IMPACT- ON QUALITY COMBINED WITH HEAT- BESIDES IT BEING. EXTRA BAD- BUT ANYTHING THAT YOU COULD PERHAPS SHARE AND THAT'S A QUESTION TO ANY OF OUR PANELISTS YEAH PERHAPS BECAUSE L. A. COUNTY YOU JUST FINISH YOUR VULNERABILITY INDEX MAYBE YOU COULD TAKE A- EVEN A CLOSER SNAPSHOT ON A COMMUNITY LIKE WILMINGTON THAT SORT HAS THIS COMPOUNDING EFFECTS THE CENTER IS TALKING ABOUT. THEY'RE HAPPY TO ADDRESS THAT THANK YOU. FOR THE QUESTION. I'M SO WE ACTUALLY FOUND. AIR QUALITY ACROSS OUR REPORT LOOKED AT FIVE FINING HAZARDS- EXTREME HEAT WAS JUST ONE OF THEM. AIR QUALITY IS WORSE THAN BY EVERY ON SIGN HAZARD THAT. THE LA REGION FACES HEAT- SO HE MAKES OUR OUR OZONE NINE FOUR. BACKSPACE AND IT OBVIOUS SEE PEOPLE THINK ABOUT WILDFIRE BUT YES CERTAINLY. LIKE AND ALSO THE NATURE OF. THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT RIGHT CAN READ MOVEMENT. YOU INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE ARE FREEWAYS. ARE PART OF THE RE WHY IT'S PLACE LIKE WILMINGTON ARE WARMER. BUT ALSO OUR PER ARE DIRECTLY IN THE- I. YOU KNOW THE CRITERIA THAT ARE. A THEY'RE IMPACTING HEALTH THE AIRPORT- PERSPECTIVE SO YES ERIC IS. BY EXTREME OR AIR POLLUTION IS BUSINESS. BY EXTREME HEAT. ON EITHER ACTUALLY WITH ALL BUT- THAT CRIMINALS IS THAT LIKE ANY CASE. THANK YOU. BERMAN THANKS FOR THAT IN WE CERTAIN KNOW THAT ANOTHER OF A LOT OF THE GOODS MOVE IMAGE AND THE MARINO IS YOUR OF AN ENTIRE FOR THAT OVER THE SO- I DON'T KNOW IF SHE HAS ANY- INSIGHT HELLO WHAT IT WAS LIKE IN AT AMAZON WAREHOUSE BUT- NOW THAT YOU'RE- A GRADUATE STUDENT PERHAPS YOU CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT- BUT MISTER STRADA ANY COMMENTS THERE JUST AS SOMEBODY WAS LIVING THROUGH WHAT- MYSTERIES PAULING WAS TALKING ABOUT. OKAY WELL WE APPRECIATE ALL YOUR TESTIMONY- ANY FOLLOW UPS YOU'RE OKAY. ALL RIGHT. OTHERS- WE'LL WRAP THAT PANEL UP FOR NOW- AND MOVE ON TO- A PANEL REALLY FOCUSED ON PREVENTION AND RESPONSE- NOT JUST THE IMPACT SIDE BUT THE ACTIONS- AND- THE ORDER I HAVE HERE WE HAVE WE HAVE FIVE PANELISTS FOR THREE MINUTES EACH- AND I HAVE FIRST ON MY LIST- KEVIN GALLEN. WHO IS THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT DIRECTOR- WITHIN L. A. COUNTY AND PERHAPS CAN COMMENT ON SO THE ACTION SIDE OF ADDRESSING THESE HEAT WAVES- WHENEVER AND WHEREVER THEY OCCUR- AND THEN SORT OF. SENTIMENT THAT WHOSE WITH GREEN LINING INSTITUTE WILL TESTIFY AFTERWARDS ON- THE BUILDING SIDE OF THINGS AND AS WELL AS THEIR THEIR LARGER PUSH AROUND- RESILIENCE ASSEMBLY CASTEEL FROM WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WILL BE JOINING US. AS WELL AS ARMY REVOL I WITH A PEN AROUND RESILIENCE CENTERS AND JOSE TAURUS WILL WRAP IT UP TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT- WE'RE AT DECARBONISATION END. OF EXTREME HEAT MITIGATION COULD OVERLAP- BUT JUST TO KICK OFF- DIRECTOR BEGAN WHEN YOU WANT TO START. SALOON ON. WHEN YOUR HANDS ARE ON THE TELLER LOOKING FOR A OF MY- AND DISASTER EVERY DAY IN THE MOST- DISASTER EXPOSED COUNTY IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY- WHERE DOES HE PLAY INTO YOUR- YOUR DAILY- RISK MANAGEMENT. THANK YOU AG GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR ADJOURNMENTS STERN VICE CHAIRMAN RODRIGUEZ AN HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S COMING DOWN IN A SERVICE THAT DIRECTOR OR LAWSUIT COUNTY'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE EXTREME HEAT EMERGENCIES AND HOW THE COUNTY. OF LOS ANGELES IS MITIGATING AGAINST PREPARING FOR RESPONDING TO AND RECOVERING FROM THESE TYPES OF EVENTS. WE DO THIS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH MANY OF OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS COUNTY DEPARTMENT. NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE- LOCAL FIELD OFFICE WHICH IS OUR LOS ANGELES OFFICE- REGIONAL STATE AND FEDERAL STATE VOTERS TO INCLUDE SOME THAT YOU FOR TODAY AND THEN OTHERS SUCH AS LIKE THE CALIFORNIA. BY VIRTUE OF OUR RISK PORTFOLIO OUR SIZE AND COMPLEXITY LOS ANGELES COUNTY FACES MANY NUMEROUS CHALLENGES WHEN. DISASTER STRIKES IN TWENTY TWENTY. NATIONAL RISK INDEX TEAM IDENTIFIED LOS ANGELES COUNTY AS HAVING THE HIGHEST RISK INDEX OF ALL COUNTIES IN THE NATION AND THIS UNDERSCORES THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE FOR LOS ANGELES COUNTY TO CONTINUE TO BUILD ITS EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT CAPACITY CAPABILITIES WITH THE GOAL OF HAVING AFFECTED RESILIENCE IN THE FACE OF ALL OF OUR NATURAL TECHNOLOGICAL. AND HUMAN CAUSED DISASTERS INCLUDING EXTREME URGENCY. IN RECENT YEARS LOS ANGELES COUNTY HAS EXPERIENCED NUMEROUS HEAT EVENTS. IN TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE THERE WERE OVER TWENTY SEPARATE SEAT EXTREME HEAT EVENTS THAT AFFECTED L. A. COUNTY AND RESULTED IN OUR LOCAL FIELD OFFICE FROM THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE. ISSUING ADVISORIES AND HE WARNS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE TWENTY PLUS EVENTS OCCURRED ON SEPTEMBER SIXTH. TWENTY TWENTY. WHEN HISTORIC RECORDS WERE SET INCLUDING A COUNTY WIDE DAYTIME OR AT THE COUNTY Y. DAYTIME HIGH OF A HUNDRED TWENTY. ONE DEGREES IN WOODLAND HILLS AND OUR OVERNIGHT TEMPERATURES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY REMAINING IN THE NINETIES WEATHER OR EXTREME HEAT EVENTS. IS THROUGH A UNITY OF EFFORT WITH OUR LOCAL STATE FEDERAL AND COMMUNITIES PARTNERS. WORDS ARE CONCERNED TO DRESSING PLANNING PREPAREDNESS RESPONSE AND RECOVERY MITIGATION MEASURES. THE COUNTY MAINTAINS A HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN THAT'S TIED TO OUR COUNTIES GENERAL PLAN SAFETY ON IT. AND IT'S ALIGNED WITH OUR COUNTIES CLIMATE VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT WHICH YOU'VE HEARD FROM EARLIER. THESE PLANS INFORM OUR WHOLE COMMUNITY APPROACH TO THREATS RISKS AND HOW WE OVERCOME THEM. IN ESSENCE THESE PLANS PROVIDE THE PASSWORD BUILDING COMMUNITY RESILIENCE WHICH IS CRITICAL IN THIS. TYPE OF AN EMERGENCY. THE COUNTY ALSO MAINTAINS AN EXTREME TEMPERATURE PLAN WHICH IS AN ANNEX TO OUR COUNTY'S EMERGENCY OPERATIONS PLAN. THESE PARTICULAR PLANS PROVIDE STRATEGIES AND FRAMEWORKS FOR HOW WE- COORDINATE A COUNTY RESPONSE TO EXTREME HEAT EMERGENCIES INCLUDING WHAT EMERGENCY PROTECTIVE MEASURES. MAY BE NEEDED TO COMBAT THESE EFFECTS IN THESE EMERGENCY SUCH AS ESTABLISHING- AND OPERATING VARIOUS DIFFERENT SITES LIKE COOLING SITES. CONDUCTING OF WATER ICE IN CRITICAL RESOURCE COMMODITY DISTRIBUTION TO ARE VULNERABLE AND AT RISK COMMUNITIES. THIS IS REALLY THE STRUCTURE SENATOR STERN THAT YOU HAD ALLUDED TO AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CONVERSATION WHEN. I HEARD IN CAESAR KERR AND IN OUR STATEWIDE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM CASING THE PLACE WHERE THE COUNTY THROUGH ITS OPERATIONAL AREA RESPONSIBILITIES. BECOME STATE COUNT BECOMES THE HUB AND SPOKE IN. COORDINATING AND SUPPORTING EFFORTS. WHEN EXTRA HEAT OVER DO OCCUR CAL EMERGE C. STRUCTURES ANY ACTS THAT INCLUDE GLUTEN FORMING THE PUBLIC OF THE RISKS POSED BY THE EMERGENCY AND ACTIONS THAT CAN BE TAKEN TO PROTECT INDIVIDUALS FAMILIES FRIENDS AND COMMUNITIES. ADDITIONALLY THE COUNTY'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT COORDINATES AND SUPPORTS COUNTY RIGHT EFFORTS TO PROTECT LIFE PROPERTY AND ENVIRONMENT. AND LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE STRIVE FOR THIS TO BE A WHOLE COMMUNITY EFFORT. THE COUNTY EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT NATION REQUIRES THIS AND ITS EVER PRESENT WITH OUR STRONG ORGANIZATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS. THAT TRAVERSE LOCAL CITIES. THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE COUNTY DEPARTMENTS CALLAWAY S. AND FEMA. A RECENT REPORTS AND STUDIES FROM GOVERNMENT ACADEMIA AND NON GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND PRIVATE SECTORS CONTINUE SHOW THAT CLIMATE CHANGE INDUCED EMERGENCIES LIKE HEAT EXTREME. HE DIVERGENCES ARE OCCURRING WITH MORE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY SO OUR GOAL IN BUILDING RESILIENT COMMUNITIES REQUIRES VERY TARGETED EFFORTS INVESTMENTS IN PUBLIC POLICY INFRASTRUCTURE AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. FOR EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT I RECOMMEND US EXPLORING A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT STRATEGIES ONE REVISING OUR GRANT METHODOLOGIES REQUIREMENTS AND PERFORMANCE PERIOD FOR CERTAIN GRANTS THAT EFFECT EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT LIKE THE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE GRANT. AND BUILDING RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE IN COMMUNITIES GRANTS THAT CONSIDER THE NATIONAL RISK INDEX AND ALSO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE MORE SIGNIFICANT TIME THAT'S IT THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH IMPLEMENTING THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS TO REDUCE THE THREATS TO EXTREME HEAT EMERGENCIES. I ALSO THINK WE SHOULD EXPLORE INCREASING FUNDING FOR EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE GRANT AND THEN HOW THOSE GRANTS FLOW THROUGH FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO THE STATE AND INTO LOCAL MUICIPAL GOVERNMENTS. AND BUILDING ON OUR COMMUNITY RESILIENCE GRANTS SO THAT THESE ARE COMMENSURATE WITH THE GROWING FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF CLIMATE CHANGE INDUCED EMERGENCIES. AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. BEFORE YOU COMMITTEE TODAY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DIRECTOR MCALLEN- NEXT UP WE HAVE SORT OF A NON. OF THE GREEN LINING INSTITUTE INSTITUTE- WHO ACTUALLY SERVED ON THE TASK FORCE TO DEVISE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER ON THE NEED FOR EXTREME HEAT RANKING PROPOSAL THAT'S NOW RESULTED IN SOME IMPORTANT LEGISLATION THAT I'M A CO AUTHOR WITH A NUMBER MY ASSEMBLY COLLEAGUES AND I THINK IF YOU. SENATORS TO- MISSED MANAT- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US TODAY AND FOR YOUR ADDRESS HERE ON SO MANY FRONTS ON BEHALF THE GREEN LINING INSTITUTE. THANK YOU. SENATOR STERN AND GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. MY NAME IS ON A MONDAY AND THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF KIND EQUITY AT THE CLEANING IN THE QUEUE. AND REMAINING WORKS TOWARD A FUTURE WHERE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR TO BUILD TWELVE LET AND HEALTHY PLACES FILLED WITH ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. AND ARE READY TO MEET THE CHALLENGES POSED BY CLIMATE CHANGE. ATTENDERS ARE MENTIONED WE WERE A MEMBER OF THE PLANET INSURANCE WORKING GROUP CONVENED BY INSURANCE COMMISSIONER RICARDO LARA. THAT WORK ON A REPORT PUBLISHED LAST FALL TITLED PROTECTING COMMUNITIES CONSERVING NATURE AND BUILDING RESILIENCE B. ONE OF THE KEY FINDINGS IN THAT REPORT. THAT WE NEED TO INCREASE AWARENESS OF THE DANGERS THE MAT BUT EXTREME HEAT POSES. PARTICULARLY FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AND ONE OF OUR REPORT RECOMMENDATIONS THAT I WANTED TO SPEAK BRIEFLY ABOUT TODAY. IT'S RAIN HEAT WAVE SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DO FOR HURRICANE. THAT WE CAN GET INFORMATION ABOUT EXTREME HEAT TRACK COMMUNITIES. TO PROMOTE SAFETY AND PREVENT THAT. THIS REPORT EXPO TO HEAT IF ONE OF THEM INTO THE THINGS THAT L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G&lt;/c&gt; COMMUNITY OF COLOR VARIANTS. FORMALLY READ MY NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE KHADDAM LOWER INCOME OF COLOR LAND AND TO HAVE YOUR TREAT PARK. I CAN PROVIDE SHADE AND COOLING LACK ACCESS TO AIR CONDITIONING AND ARE OFTEN LOCATED NEXT TO A LOT OF HEAT TRAPPING CONCRETE AND ASPHALT SURFACES THAT CAN RADIATE HEAT. IN A STUDY OF OVER HUNDRED URBAN AREAS IN THE U. S. FORMERLY REDLINED NEIGHBORHOODS AND NEARLY EVERY CITY WERE HOTTER THAN THE NON REDLINED NEIGHBORHOODS. ESPECIALLY FOR BLACK COMMUNITY DONE BY NEARLY THIRTEEN DEGREES. AND ALL OF THIS ADDS UP TO EXTREMELY HIGHER TEMPERATURES IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND INCREASED HEALTH AND SAFETY RISK THREAT THAT EXTREME HEAT HOLDEN ESPECIALLY OUR FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES TREATING IT AS AN EMERGENCY AS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO BETTER PROTECT OUR COMMUNITY. UNDER THE PLAN THE INSURANCE WORKING GROUP WHATEVER RECOMMENDATION IS TO CREATE A DATA CENTER RANKED HEATWAVE. AND WE HAVE MODELS WE CAN LOOK TO SUCH AS CALIFORNIA'S RED FLAG WARNING FOR WILDFIRE CONDITIONS AND NO WAS RANKING SYSTEM FOR TROPICAL STORMS AND HURRICANES. REMINDING GROWING UP IN NEW. DURING SEASON HAVING INFORMATION ABOUT WEATHER STORM COULD BE A TROPICAL STORM OR CATEGORY ONE. HURRICANE WITH EXTREMELY HELPFUL THAT MY FAMILY COULD MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER WE NEEDED TO BOARD UP WINDOWS AND YOU STAND BACK CHECKING ON NEIGHBORS. AND IT HELPED AT THE SITE IF YOU COULD STAY HOME WITH SAFE ENOUGH OR IF YOU NEED TO EVACUATE. HE PLAYED RANKING SYSTEM WE SIMILARLY RECOMMENDING CATEGORIES AND INFORMATION ABOUT THE- LOCATION IT'S LEVEL OF SEVERITY AND DURATION TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE PUBLIC TO TRACK. WE ALSO RECOMMEND INCLUDING SAFETY PRECAUTIONS FOR THE PUBLIC TO TAKE BASED ON THE INTENSITY OF THE HEATERS AND- AND LASTLY ENSURING EQUITABLE ACCESS TO THIS COMMUNICATION WILL NEED TO BE A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THE SYSTEM. ARTICLE WRITING WITH THE TESTING IN AWARENESS ABOUT THE HEALTH RISKS OF EXTREME HEAT AND CAN HELP ENABLE POLICYMAKERS TO DEVELOP RISK REDUCTION STRATEGIES. AND HELP COMMUNITIES BETTER PREPARE FOR EXTREME WEATHER. IN ADDITION OF THIS RANKING SYSTEM FOR HEAT WAVE WE ALSO NEED A SIMULTANEOUSLY INVESTING POLICY INTERVENTIONS THAT CAN DIRECTLY MEDICAID HARM. EQUITABLE ACCESS TO COOLING AND RESILIENCE CENTERS WITH MY COLLEAGUES WILL BE COME OUT SHORTLY. SO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL OF THE ATTENDANCE. EQUALITY JACKIE'S THANK YOU. THANK YOU MUCH YOU SO MUCH RESTAURANT- I THINK NEXT WE'RE GONNA BE MOVING ON TO ARMY REBEL WITH A PEN THE ASIAN PACIFIC ENVIRONMENTAL NETWORK. I'M SORRY DID I MISS THAT YES I'M SORRY MISS CASTEEL- DO WE HAVE SENT A KESTEVEN ALONG WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. POLITIES THANK YOU WELCOME. HI GOOD AFTERNOON SURE NUMBER CYNTHIA CASTEEL POLICY ADVOCATE FOR WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY SO THRILLED TO BE ANCHORED ON THIS PANEL FOR OVER FIVE DECADES WESTERN CENTER HAS ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCING POVERTY THROUGH THE LENS OF ECONOMIC AND RACIAL JUSTICE USING OUR THREE PRIMARY AREAS OF EXPERTISE WHICH IS ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE PUBLIC BENEFITS AND HOUSING WE'RE PROUD TO BE A PART OF A GROWING COALITION COLLETTE BY THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION REGIONAL ASTHMA MANAGEMENT. AND PREVENTION INTERCITY LAWCENTER LEADERSHIP COUNCIL MADE UP OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE PUBLIC HEALTH AND TEN ADVOCATES WHO ARE CALLING ON THE STATE TO SET STANDARDS FOR INDOOR AIR TEMPERATURE TO ADDRESS EXTREME HEAT I HOUSING PLACES OF GATHERING IN REFUGE SUCH AS WORKPLACES AND THE HOME SHOW HIGH OCCURRENCES OF HEAT RELATED ILLNESS AND DEATH. CALIFORNIA'S HABITABILITY LAWS WHICH ADDRESS BASIC HEALTH AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR RENTAL HOUSING CURRENTLY. FAILED TO ACCOUNT FOR EXTREME HEAT. OUR ORGAN. WORK ALONGSIDE RESIDENTS BETTER ACUTELY AND DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY GROWING CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE TRAGIC AND UNACCEPTABLE RISE OF HEAT RELATED DEATHS IN THE LAST DECADE. RECENT MEDIA STORIES IT HIGHLIGHTED THE INCREASE IN THESE ISSUES AND THE STATE'S BASS UNDER COUNTING OF DEATHS ATTRIBUTABLE TO EXTREME HEAT. BUT THE TRUTH TOLD A CRISIS IS LIKELY SIX TIMES HIGHER THAN REPORTED AND THIS NUMBER DOES NOT INCLUDE IMPACTS TO FAMILIES RELATED ILLNESS WHICH DID NOT OPEN. TO SOMEONE'S DEATH. THE STORY IS ALSO CLEAR THAT LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS PARTICULARLY IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ARE INCREASINGLY VULNERABLE TO THE IMPACTS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY LIVE IN RURAL OR URBAN AREAS AND IN A RANGE OF HOUSING HI. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CHILDREN THE ELDERLY PEOPLE WITH PRE EXISTING HEALTH CONDITIONS FARMWORKERS THOSE WITH DISABILITIES AND JUST LARGELY THE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THAT ARE AT RISK. AND LIKE MANY ISSUES THIS FALLS ON CLEAR INCOME LINES FOR PEOPLE WITHOUT ACCESS WITH THE HOME AIR CONDITIONING OR SHADE HE CAN BE DANGEROUS AND ULTIMATELY DEADLY. AND IN ADDITION TO HEAT EXHAUSTION AND HEATSTROKE EXTREME HE CAN WORSEN CARDIOVASCULAR AND RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS INCREASING THE RISK OF STROKES HEART ATTACKS IN ASTHMA ATTACKS NOT TO MENTION THE EFFECTS IT CAN HAVE ON MEDICATION AND MEDICAL EQUIPMENT STORAGE. THE MOST ALARMING AND I THINK THAT LINE HERE IS THAT THESE TYPES THAT'S OUR 100% PREVENTABLE. CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY IMPOSES UNIFORM OBLIGATIONS AND ALL LANDLORDS TO MAINTAIN HABITABLE HOUSING SUCH AS FUNCTIONING WATER ELECTRICAL AND HEATING SYSTEM BUT DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY STANDARD TO BE MET AND CONNECTION WITH EXTREME HEAT. THE RESULT IS THAT MUCH OF OUR HOUSING STOCK IS MISSING BASIC INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN MADE- BACK TO REALLY BLOCK MUCH OF THE IMPACTS OF EXTREME HEAT SUCH AS PROPERLY INSULATING HOMES PROVIDING SHADE. HE FOUND. A VOICE HIGH AND ARE KIND. DESPITE HERE- OVER YEAR I TEMP. AND MORE FOR AND SEVERE HE- THE DOES NOT CURRENTLY WORK. LINE TO INSURE THAT TEIR UNITS CAN MAINTAIN A MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE AND THAT SUPPORTS BASIC. BASIC HEALTH AND WELL BEING. OUR CLIENTS ARE LEFT DEFENSELESS FROM EXCRUCIATING HEAT BASED ON THE UNEQUAL COOLING INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE STATE THAT FAVORS INDIVIDUALS WITH MONEY PRIVILEGE BETTER HOUSING OPPORTUNITY AND GREEN SPACE. AND CLEARLY EVERY PERSON IN THE STATE DESERVES TO LIVE IN A HOME THAT PROTECTS THEM FROM TEMPERATURE EXTREMES WHETHER IT'S COLD OR HOT. THE CLEAREST AND MOST COMMON SENSE SOLUTION TO PREVENT THE NEEDLESS HE RELATED THAT. THAT WE'RE SEEING IS ENSURING THAT CALIFORNIANS HAVE AN ACCESS TO A SAFE AND HOW HOME WHERE THEY CAN FIND REFUGE FROM EXTREME HEAT AND ITS CONSEQUENT EFFECTS. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE WITH CHANGES TO REGULATIONS THAT MATCH OUR COMMITMENT TO ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE AND EQUITABLE MANNER. AND OF COURSE FUNDING INVESTMENT OF RESOURCES. SO AGAIN I REALLY APPRECIATE BEING PUT ON THIS PANEL THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU MISS CASTILLO A VERY INSIGHTFUL COMMENTS AND- FOR. YOUR DRILLING DOWN ON THIS. THE LANDLORD TENANT ISSUE IN SOME OF THOSE POWER DISPARITIES THAT END UP RESULTING IN- IN TRAGEDIES WE DO APPRECIATE THE- THE TESTIMONY- I MEAN RECALL- EIGHT. FREQUENT TESTIFY TO THIS COMMITTEE. AND IT AND AGREED ARCHITECT OF OUR WORK LAST YEAR AND- JUST A TREMENDOUS ADVOCATE WE DO APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE BEHALF APE AND WELCOME. THANK YOU SO MUCH CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK TODAY- I'M GRATEFUL TO BE HERE REPRESENTING A PAN ASIAN PACIFIC ENVIRONMENTAL NETWORK. WE'RE GRASSROOTS ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE WORK THAT WORKS WITH ASIAN IMMIGRANT AND REFUGEE COMMUNITIES IN THE BAY AREA. MANY OF WHOM ARE MONOLINGUAL AN ELDERLY- AND WE ORGANIZE ON A MULTITUDE OF CLIMATE JUSTICE ISSUES. ARE WERE ALSO A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA BARBARA JUSTICE ALLIANCE SOLIDARITY WITH FARMWORKERS RURAL COMMUNITIES INDIGENOUS PEOPLE AND WORKING CLASS COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ACROSS THE STATE. CALIFORNIA IS BEING PUSHED TO EXTREMES WE HEAR SCIENTISTS SAY THAT THERE ISN'T REALLY A NORMAL ANYMORE AND THAT WHEN YOU ADD THESE CRISES TOGETHER THE IMPACT IS CUMULATIVE. FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN PLAGUED WITH THE BURDEN OF APOSTLE FUEL POLLUTING INDUSTRIES FOR GENERATIONS THERE'S REALLY NOTHING YOU ABOUT CUMULATIVE HEALTH CURTAINS. THIS IS THE CASE IN RICHMOND WHERE WE ORGANIZE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE LIVING ON THE FENCE LINE OF THE CHEVRON REFINERY. FOR US THE CLIMATE CLIMATE CRISIS IS PERVASIVE. MEANING IT IS FELT DAILY NOT JUST DURING TIMES OF DISASTER. THIS MEANS CHRONIC AIR POLLUTION OIL SPILLS GLARING EXCLUSIONS AS WELL AS HE WADES BLACKOUTS PARISHIONERS. AND WILDFIRE'S SMOKE. ADDITIONAL MODELS OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT HOWEVER ARE PROVING DEEPLY INADEQUATE. THE COORDINATED THROUGH MILITARIZED ENTITIES LIKE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT THEY WILL PUT MY UPON PROTOCOLS LIKE EVACUATING TO FAR AWAY SITE LIKE FAIRGROUNDS. THEY SHARE ALERTS IN ONE TO TWO LANGUAGES THEY PROVIDE AN EMPTY SPACE WITHOUT TAILORED SERVICES AND PROGRAMMING. THESE TYPES OF POLICIES ARE COLLECTIVELY COLLECTIVELY SHUTTING OUT MANY MANY PEOPLE FROM THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED. YOUR HISTORIC DISINVESTMENT HOWEVER OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE HAD TO BE INCREDIBLY RESILIENT OR ORGANIZING FOR CHANGE IN INNOVATING LOCAL MODELS OF CAR FOR CRISIS RESPONSE. WHEN DISASTERS STRIKE WE SEXY TIME AND TIME AGAIN COMMUNITIES COME TOGETHER PROTECTING EACH OTHER AND REBUILDING TOGETHER THROUGH MUTUAL AID WORKS TO SHARE RESOURCES SCHOOLS PROVIDING FOOD TO FAMILIES WHERE COMMUNITY CENTERS PROVIDING ELECTRICITY ACCESS BUT WE NEED PROPER INVESTMENT AND RESOURCES. EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION SUPPORT DISASTER REPORT PUBLISHED THIS NEED AND CALLS FOR TARGETED INVESTMENTS TO BOLSTER THE SOCIAL FABRIC AND INFRASTRUCTURE IN OUR COMMUNITY. THAT MEANS INVESTING IN THE SERVICES AND FACILITIES THAT ENSURE THAT PEOPLE AND NEIGHBORHOODS ARE QUICK TO RESPOND. ONE EXAMPLE OUR RESILIENCE HUBS THE TRANSFORMATION OF TRUSTED BUILDINGS LIKE LIBRARIES YOUTH AND SENIOR CENTER FOR HEALTH CLINICS INTO FACILITIES THAT OFFER SPACE TO GATHER AND ACCESS SERVICES. NOT ONLY DURING TIMES OF STOCK IN DISASTERS LIKE KEEP WEIGHTS BUT ARE THERE ON A DAILY BASIS. THEY MADE POSSIBLE THE SIMULTANEOUS INVESTMENT IN SOLUTIONS LIKE IMPROVING INSULATION FOR COOLING AND HEATING CLEAN ENERGY INSTALLATION FOR BACKUP POWER DURING GRID OUTAGES OR AIR FILTRATION SYSTEMS TO COMBAT LAMPARD SMOKE. ONE EXAMPLE IS THE RISE NEED CENTER WHICH A PLAN IS COLLABORATING WITH BECOME A YOUTH LED RESILIENCE CENTER WHICH ONCE COMPLETE WILL PROVIDE A SAFE SPACE FOR CLIMATE RESPOND. AS WELL AS EXPANDED COMMUNITY HEALTH AND YOUTH SERVICES AND IMPORTANTLY THE DENTURES GO FAR BEYOND NARROWLY DEFINED COOLING CENTERS CAN PROVIDE BY OFFERING A SUITE OF INTEGRATED MEASURES BEYOND CLIMATE RELIEF SUCH AS FOOD DISTRIBUTION WATER EMERGENCY SUPPLY. INTERNET ACCESS AND CHILD CARE ON IN ENTERTAINMENT- AND PROGRAMMING JUST TO NAME A FEW ALL LOCATED WITHIN COMMUNITY BUILDINGS PEOPLE TRUST AND ALREADY GATHERING SO WITH THAT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT. THAT CREATED IN AND LOOKING FORWARD TO QUESTION. THANK YOU MEASURE OUT DO IT- THANK LAST ON OUR PANEL WE HAVE- MR TAURUS JOSE TAURUS FROM THE BUILDING DECARBONIZATION COALITION. WELCOME MR TAURUS NEITHER BE SCREENED. YOU'RE WITH US HELLO SB NINETY THREE YES SIR NORI. SO MUCH FOR THE INVITATION GOOD AFTERNOON SHERMAN STERN MASTERMAN RODRIGUEZ MEMBERS- MY NAME IS JOSE TARZAN ON THE CALIFORNIA DIRECTOR RIAN BUILDING DECARBONIZATION COALITION. BUILDING DECARBONIZATION COALITION UNITED DIVERSE SET OF STAKEHOLDERS IN TWO DEPARTMENTS BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND. LEVERAGE BUILDING DECARBONIZATION- AS A VEHICLE FOR CREATING FOR ONE HEALTHY HOMES COMMUNITIES TRUMP CALIFORNIANS TO ALL ELECTRIC BUILDINGS. SO NO IN THE CONTEXT OF EXTREME HEAT RIGHT REALLY THINKING ABOUT ELECTRIFICATION RYAN SEGAL IN A WORKSTATION OPENING A PATHWAY TO HEALTHY AFFORDABLE AND RESILIENT AND BUILDINGS OVERALL IT WAS A MEAN INCREASE TO HELP THE WHIMS ONLY CALL. NINE ELECTRIFICATION TAKE ON THE CLIMATE CRISIS WHICH IS CONFIDENCE WE NEED ANOTHER EXTREME WEATHER- YOU KNOW EVENTS LIKE WILDFIRES BUT ALSO LUMINATE THE KNOX POLLUTION OUR HOMES AND WORKPLACES- AS WE KNOW THIS IS PARTIALLY IMPACTED MUSIC COLORING CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THEY ARE MORE EXPOSED TO CONSTITUTION AND WHEN IT COMES TO BUILDINGS AND HOMES HOME SPECIFICALLY RIGHT VIROLOGISTS COMMUNITIES MORE LIKELY TO LITTLE OLDER SMALLER LESS ANIMATED MORE CRIME MOMENTS THEREFORE THE WAY WE'RE LOOKING AT BUILDING ELECTION COMMISSION AS WE WERE HOPING WE CAN HELP LOWER INCOME AND DISPENSED YUNIS. IN ALL CALIFORNIA'S HEALTHIER AFFORDABLE AND SAFE HOMES ALONG WITH CREATING NEW JOBS AND CHRYSOCOLLA OVER CALIFORNIANS ALSO LEARN THE BEST FACILITIES LIKE SCHOOLS AND RESILIENCE CENTERS SO NOW I CAN TAKE A DEEP DIVE INTO THE STREAM HE WANTED TO LIVE AS WE THINK ABOUT IT- IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT POVERTY IS A STRONG INDICATOR- STRONGER INDICATOR OF WHETHER FOLKS HAVE ACCESS OR CONDITIONING THANKS I AM IT. SO NOT ONLY DO WE WANNA CERTAINLY FIND HOMES MAKING IN THE LECTURE FREDDIE IN ORDER TO COMBAT AND FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE SHOULD PROVIDE ALL THE BENEFITS THAT WERE HOPING TO GET TO A SAFETY TO SAY OR HOW THE HOME THAT WE WANT TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE. RELIEF TO THOSE MOST IN NEED. SO WE TALK ABOUT THE AMERICAN. FROM BUILDING LIKE. PERSPECTIVE WORKS ABOUT STRAIGHT. HE COMES. THE LAST OUR DEGREE. I TECHNOLOGY COOLEY AND HE HOMES AND THIS IMAGE SHOWS ONE. AND CAN BE. AT WORK- WELL VIRGIN I THINK THIS MAY- ANY- ALSO BE THE- A SALES JUST IN ALSO PROVIDE MUCH MORE CARE WILL NEED TO FOLLOW. YOU CAN LOOK IT'S BEEN OR HOW BUCKS. THE BOOKS. ON AND IN STABILISATION PLAN FOR AND THE AIR AND WITH THAT HE PUMP- SO WE DISEASES TO AND THE COMMISSION BUT THIS OUR AYE FOR RECENT AS WE THINK WE NEED A MAN STOCKS OF PEACE PROSPECTS NOT ON COMBAT TIME AND CHANGE BUT ALSO TO TAKE ON EXTREME- SO FOLKS FIND THE GAS FOR QUINCY MILLION YEAH. AT TWENTY THIRTY- BUT TO SEE SECRET TO THIRTY METERS FINAL BUT I DON'T WE ARE OF BILLS FROM FROM OUR STATE. WILL ALSO BE PROVIDED UP AND ASK SORRY. ANOTHER REASON SUPPOSE TO CLOSE ONE MILLION- THE FOR ADULTS DECARBONIZATION WE THANK OFFERS A CRITICAL. TO RETROFIT HOMES IMMEDIATE COMMUNITIES WHILE ALSO TACKLING OUR CLIMATE TARGETS- AND YOU KNOW WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S A NEED FOR INVESTING BOTH IN HOMES IN PUBLIC FACILITIES. NOT ONLY ARE WHERE ALL. EIGHT RESILIENCE CENTERS AND PLACES LIKE SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES START WHILE ALSO TRANSITION OUR- FAMILY AND IS ALIENATING WHILE ENSURING WE HAVE BEEN GETTING JOBS AND CREATED WORKFORCE REALLY TRYING TO CONNECT RIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE TO SOME OF THE PRODUCTS THAT ARE FRIENDS AND OTHERS MENTION- AND WE THINK THAT DETERMINATION IS ONE WAY TO TAKE. ME. A LOT OF THE OTHER SHOULD BE ABLE. THANK THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY RESTORES- WE WILL- TURN TO QUESTIONS NOW- NOTHING FOR MY COLLEAGUES ON THE COMMITTEE I HAVE A COUPLE OF FOLLOW UPS- I GUESS I'LL START. I'LL START LAST TO FIRST- JUST TO FOLLOW UP YOU WITH YOU BRIEFLY MR TORE AS- IN TERMS OF HOW. PEOPLE HEAR THE WORD HEAT PUMP AND THEY THINK IT'S JUST- PUMPING HEAT INTO THE HOUSE BUT- THESE ARE TWO WAY MACHINES IN AND HOW DO THEY- WHAT WHAT WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT COST WISE OF. OF GETTING AN INSTALLATION DONE- COMPARED TO THE SORT OF UP FRONT COSTS OF THE ALTERNATIVE. YEAH HE SAID CERTAIN THE PORTION YES- BOX RIGHT THE NAME DOES THIS MAKE IT SEEM LIKE IT WOULD ONLY BE FOR HEATING BUT HE TALKS TO BILLS CLEANS. AND HITTING RIGHT AND THAT'S BECAUSE HE'S NOT SCHOOL HE FROM. THE COLD OUTDOOR AIR TRANSFERRED INDOORS IN WARMER MONTHS AND THEY CAN ALSO PULL HE TERM OUT FROM INDOOR AIR TO CLEAR HOME RIGHT SO THAT'S THAT'S HOW THEY FUNCTION. IN TERMS OF CAGR- YOU KNOW THEY'RE TERRIBLE AND SOMETIMES EVEN MORE AFFORDABLE YOU THINK OF PURCHASING A WHOLE H. FAX SYSTEM RIGHT WE'VE SEEN. SAVINGS OF UP TO THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS WHEN YOU'RE REPLACING BOTH FURNACE. AND AN AIR CONDITIONING UNIT AND YOU KNOW WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE NEED TO BUILD A MARKET FOR IT RIGHT ENHANCE WHY WE APPRECIATE KIND OF THE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED. BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT- IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT FOLKS HAVE MORE ACCESS TO IT THAT YOU CAN TECHNOLOGY. ALTHOUGH READILY AVAILABLE BECOMES MORE MAINSTREAM AND STUFF THANKS- AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT FOLKS CAN RELY ON- YOU KNOW FOR ME- AND DEALING WITH EXTREME EIGHT. AND I MEAN TO IT AFTER ABOUT HEAT PUMPS JUST A QUICK ANECDOTE FROM FAMILY MEMBER AND- GOES IF I IF I MAY SENATOR- YEAH. AND IT GOES BACK TO CENTER THE MOST QUESTIONS EARLIER- ASSEMBLY MEMBER IN MARINO VALLEY- ENOUGH BOOKS ABOUT MORALITY. AND YOU KNOW THEY WERE DEALING WITH YOU KNOW WHILE YOU. LONG IT DIDN'T PULL DOWN HOME SO THAT WAS ALREADY A CHALLENGE AND WILDFIRES ARE HAPPENING HERE IN THAT THIRD AS WELL SO YOU REALLY RARELY SEEN WHEN I WAS AT THE RESIDENTS FAMILY MEMBER THE CHALLENGER. DO YOU TURN ON THE AIR CONDITIONING THAT DOESN'T HAVE INFILTRATION- LIKE HE COMPLAINED- OR DO YOU OR DO YOU AND IT IS AS AND I CAN BE TURNED HERE THE MORNING AT THE ASHES ARE COMING IN. THE ASHES ARE COMING IN- OR DO YOU DEAL WITH A ON I THINK UNFORTUNATELY THE SITUATION THAT MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE DEALING WITH. AND EVEN IN SOME AREAS WHERE YOU DON'T MEANWHILE SPOKE TO BE SUFFERING. REALLY BAD OUT THERE FOLLOWING SIMPLY THINK THAT THINKING ABOUT. THIS LIST SICKENING GIVES THAT OPPORTUNITY. WELL THAT'S THAT'S ONE CONCLUDES I WOULD SAY I WOULD FROM THIS. INTO WE'LL BE TALKING TO. SUBS PAN AND GIVING THEM SOME OF OUR FEEDBACK BASED ON THIS TESTIMONY BUT- YOU KNOW WE WE'VEHEARD TESTIMONY ABOUT- THE EXTREME HEAT. FUNDING EFFORTS AND STRATEGIES GOING ON THERE'S- THERE'S BUILDING DECARBONIZATION EFFORTS THE ADMINISTRATION'S UNDERTAKING. THERE'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING INVESTMENTS THE ADMINISTRATION'S UNDERTAKING THERE'S ENERGY EFFICIENCY INVESTMENTS WERE UNDERTAKING. AND LOOKING FOR THOSE ALIGNMENTS WHERE DOES THE SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES INVESTMENTS. AND ARE INFILL HOUSING INVESTMENTS WHERE CAN THEY LEVERAGE ALSO COOLING OPPORTUNITIES- WHERE CAN WE FIND THE INTERFACE BETWEEN SAY. A TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE COMMUNITIES IN INVESTING IN URBAN GREENING- IN COOL ROOFS IN OPEN SPACE ALONG SIDE AN UP LIFT EFFORT WITHIN THE HOME AROUND- BUILDING DECARBONIZATION IT ALSO. IMPROVES COOLING LOOKING FOR THOSE SYNERGIES I THINK WILL BE CRITICAL TO MAKING- OUR INVESTMENT STRATEGY COST EFFECTIVE FIRST OF ALL BUT ALSO. TO NOT EXPECT GOVERNMENT TO HAVE THAT MANY INTERVENTION POINTS IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO REACH PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE NOT. FAMILIAR WITH THE SYSTEM AND THAT'S WHERE. ORGANIZATIONS LIKE MISS KRISTY OZER. MISMA NOT SIR MISS REBELS ARE VERY IMPORTANT- IN CONNECTING US TO COMMUNITY. BUT YOU KNOW SINCE WE HAVE MISTER MACALLAN HERE WHO'S AT THE HELM- DO WHEN BAD THINGS HAPPEN I JUST. I AM NOT SURE WHAT WHAT NUMBERS YOU'VE GOT- ON YOU. IF YOU'RE ARE STILL AVAILABLE BUT- I DID WANT TO DRILL DOWN AND JUST GET A SENSE OF HOW MANY- WHAT THE RESOURCE MIX LOOKS LIKE IN A IN A COUNTY THE SIZE OF LA- DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE AT RISK DURING ANY GIVEN HE'D HAVE BEEN. AND HOW MANY CENTERS FOR INSTANCE THAT WE HAVE FOR THOSE FOLKS I MEAN WHAT WHAT IS THE SORT OF- RISK TO MITIGATION TOOL. PROPORTION LOOK LIKE RIGHT NOW STERN SO. A LOT OF OUR DATA IS KIND OF ANECDOTAL FROM PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES THE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION AT THE BEGINNING YOU KNOW WE BASED OUR MITIGATION MEASURES OR OUR OUR EMERGENCY PROTECTIVE MEASURES I SHOULD SAY- ON ON THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE IS FORECAST FOR SPECIFIC AREAS SO L. A. COUNTY SO GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE YOU CAN HAVE AN EXTREME HEAT EMERGENCY OCCURRING IN ONE PART OF THE COUNTY AND MODERATE TO NORMAL CONDITIONS IN ANOTHER PART OF THE COUNTY. SO OUR RESPONSE IS VERY MUCH BASED ON THE REAL WORLD FORECAST THAT WE'RE GETTING AND THEN THE DEPLOYMENT OF RESOURCES TO THOSE AFFECTED AREAS. WITHIN THAT WE WORK WITH OUR PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. ALONG WITH OUR CITIES TO IDENTIFY YOU KNOW AREAS THAT ARE GOING TO BE MOST VULNERABLE WE IMPACTED SO BY THAT I MEAN. YOU KNOW CERTAIN COMMUNITIES CAN TAKE HIGHER LEVELS OF HEAT THEN OTHER COMMUNITY STOPS OF URGENCY MANAGEMENT- ISN'T THE ORGANIZATION THAT MAKES THAT DETERMINATION THAT'S USUALLY DONE. IN COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE IS FORECASTING OR COUNTIES DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND SPECIFICALLY ARE COUNTY HEALTH OFFICER. AND WE I NEED SHE COORDINATION MEETINGS AS THIS PROCESS GOES ON TO IDENTIFY AREAS THAT ARE GOING TO BE MOST IMPACTED AND THAT'S WHEN WE ACTIVATE THESE DIFFERENT EMERGENCY PROTECTIVE MEASURES OF WHICH ONE IS COOLING CENTERS. I'M DALY THEY ARE NOT THE END ALL SALE ALL SOLUTION. THERE ARE OTHER STATE. BASED ON BASE ON THE- THEY DEPLOY OF OTHER RESOURCE- GOING OFF OF ONE OF OUR PREVIOUS- AS- TESTIMONIES TODAY. YOU KNOW THEY THEY COUNTY WORKS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CITIES ON THE SCHOOLING CENTER PROGRAM A LOT OF THEM ARE AT. FACILITIES THAT HAVE. OTHER TYPES OF PROGRAMS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM SO THEY ARE GETTING A LOT MORE BENEFIT THAN JUST- COOL AIR SO A LOT OF THE COUNTY SITES ARE OUT OF LIBRARIES. A LOT OF CITY SITES OR IN. AREAS OR PARKS AND REC FACILITIES THAT INCLUDES YOU KNOW ACCESS TO INTERNET- POTENTIALLY FOOD. BEING PROVIDED THERE AND PROGRAMMING TO SUPPORT THEM SO THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED AT THE SITE. SO THE SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION SENATOR IS HOW MANY. IT'S REALLY A BROAD STROKE- WE USUALLY HAVE MORE THAN A FEW DOZEN ACTIVATED- IF IT'S A WIDESPREAD EVENT. AND PROPORTIONALLY WE SEE USUALLY A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE ACTUALLY USING THAT RESOURCE. AND I THINK THE HIGHEST USE OF THOSE RESOURCES WAS ACTUALLY DURING KOBE WHEN WE HAD ONE OF OUR- KEY EVENTS DURING THAT- MOST RESTRICTIVE PERIOD OF TIME DURING THE STATE'S DROUGHT HOME ORDERS. AND THERE WERE REALLY NO OTHER OPPORTUNITIES WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE COUNTY IS A LOT OF PEOPLE USE. THEIR NORMAL KIND OF. GO TO PLACES FOR RELIEVING THEMSELVES OF SOME OF THAT HE IMPACTS ARE GOING TO SHOPPING CENTRES AND MALLS AND THINGS LIKE THAT OUTDOOR RECREATION AT THE OCEAN- AND SO WHEN ALL OF THAT STUFF IS UP AND FUNCTIONING WE USUALLY SEE YOU KNOW PRETTY PRETTY MODERATE LEVELS OF- ATTENDANCE AT AT THE- AT THE GOVERNMENT RUN- SITES. AND WOULD YOU SAY I MEAN TO THE GOVERNMENT RUN SAY- COUNTY FAIRGROUND OR A COUNTY LIBRARY OR YOU KNOW CITY COMMUNITY CENTER OR EVEN. I MEAN WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS THIS PROPOSAL AROUND RESILIENCE HAVE WHICH IS SORT OF A- PUBLIC PRIVATE COMMUNITY BASED MY- BUT IN TERMS OF HOW YOU ACTUALLY CHECK ON PEOPLE AT HOME FOR THOSE PEOPLE GEN. DON'T WANT TO LEAVE HOMEOR WHO MAY NOT OTHERWISE BE ON THE RADAR MIGHT NOT SHOW UP AT ONE OF THE CENTERS HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY. WHAT IS THE WHAT WAS THE SAFE CHECK LOOK LIKE DO YOU POORLY FOR EXAMPLE- YOUR PAYCHECK BEST OR YOUR WEAK DATA. OR SSI. IN CORAL DAD SAY WITH THAT HEAT MAP AT THE TOP AND TO SORT OF. FIND IF WAYS GET INTO WITH PEOPLE AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE OKAY. YES AND THANKS FOR BRINGING THAT UP- DEFINITELY AND- OUR LEAD. DEPARTMENT IN THAT AFTER IS THROUGH OUR DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC. SOCIAL SERVICES AND ON THIS ACTUALLY CAME UP IN ONE OF THE MORE RECENT HEAT WAVES- WHEN THERE WAS COORDINATION BETWEEN YOU KNOW YOUR OFFICE AND ARE SUPERVISED ONE OF OUR SUPERVISORS OFFICES. IT ABOUT THIS VERY TOPIC AND WE WERE ABLE TO NECW BACKWARDS. DID NOT WE WERE ABLE TO. AT A MAKE SURE THAT- YOU CONTINUES ON SO THAT'S BEEN A STANDING PRACTICE WITHIN THE COUNTY FOR YEARS IT'S A PART OF THAT EXTREME TEMPERATURE PLAN AND WE UTILIZE THOSE DIFFERENT- FORTY DEVELOP DATABASES THAT HAVE A TIENE WITH. OUR COUNTY DEPARTMENT TO INITIATE OUT THROUGH CASE WORKERS IN THAT WE COORDINATE WITH. IN CALIFORNIA AT A SCENE ON THEIR VULNERABLE POPULATION DATABASES TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COMMUNICATIONS THAT THEY'RE PUSHING OUT. BECAUSE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT OVERLAP WHEN THESE EVENTS OCCUR THAT THERE'S MOST LIKELY ALSO PUBLIC SAFETY POWER START UPS OCCURRING- AND HEIGHTENED FIRE WEATHER SO WE REALLY HAVE ELEVATED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS- AND PUT AN EMPHASIS ON. IMPLEMENTING THESE BROADER COORDINATION ROLES WITH DIFFERENT DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY. BUT ON EVERY IN ANY GIVEN EVENT TO ME HOW HOW MANY PEOPLE DOES THAT MEAN YOU ACTUALLY MIGHT HAVE TO GET IN TOUCH WITH YOU KNOW ON A ON A ON A BIG DO SO LIKE WE TALK ABOUT THE 121 DEGREES DAY RIGHT IF ALL SYSTEMS ARE FUNCTIONING THE RIGHT WAY AND IT'S- IT'S ONE TWENTY ONE IN CANOGA PARK. I DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW IT'S PROBABLY SOMETHING THAT INTO A COMA AND IN THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY SO NEEDS LIKE YOU SAID A HUGE REACH. COULD THERE BE A DAY WHERE YOU'RE HAVING IT. YOU'RE LITERALLY HAVING TO REACH OUT TO LIKE A MILLION PEOPLE AT THEIR HOMES ON ANY GIVEN DAY AND SORT OF. DOING SOME KIND OF WELLNESS CHECK I MEAN I JUST THINK ABOUT HOW. HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ON SOME KIND OF SOCIAL SERVICES. OR DISABILITY. YOU KNOW WITHIN A COUNTY OF. ELEVEN MILLION YOU'VE GOT. ON ANY GIVEN DAY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. SO I MEAN IF YOU FOUND THROUGH THESE PAST HEAT WAVES THAT THEIR BOTTLENECKS WITH THAT INTERFACE AND WHAT CAN WE DO TO SORT OF IMPROVE. SO IT'S NOT JUST THE TWEET- THE ALERT. BUT IT'S LIKE IT'S GOT THAT THAT LEVEL OF SECURITY THAT WE SEE SAY FROM. US YOU KNOW LIKE YOU SAY WITH THE SS THE SOCIAL WORKER THEMSELVES IS. MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S SOME INTERFACE AND THAT. THEY CAN AND GET- YOU KNOW. SOME KIND OF TECHNOLOGY FROM THE UTILITY OR TO BRING THINGS TO THE HOMES LIKE HOW. HAVE YOU SEEN THAT MITIGATION. AND RESPONSE IN ACTION. YEAH SO I MEAN I CAN FOLLOW UP WITH DAY WITH THE COMMITTEE WITH SOME. DETAILED RESPONSES TODAY TO THE NUMBERS. I DON'T HAVE THAT OFF THE OFF THE CUFF RIGHT NOW- AS IT RELATES TO THE SECOND PART I THINK THERE'S DEFINITELY STILL ADDITIONAL WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. AS IT RELATES TO ENSURING THAT WERE EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATING OUT TO. ALL THOSE VARIOUS- VARIOUS GROUPS. WHAT WE'VE WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING AND I THINK IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE CONTINUE CONVERSATION. IS ENSURING THAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR THE RIGHT. THE RIGHT POPULATION GROUP. MEANING THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION AND NOT JUST PULLING FROM DATABASES AND SAYING LIKE EVERYONE WITHIN THIS DATABASE NEEDS TO BE. COMMUNICATED TO BASED ON BASED ON. AN EVENT OCCURRING WHERE THEY GEOGRAPHICALLY ARE LOCATED- WE HAVE TO BE VERY BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF L. A. COUNTY WE HAVE TO BE VERY. I THOUGHT. D. AND HOW. WATCHING THE IS DATA POINTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE- EVEN IF IN I GETTING THE RIM TO THE TO THE MOST- IMPACTED COMMUNITIES AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO YOU- GET THROUGH THAT THAT OF EMERGENCY AS BEST AS THEY CAN. THANK YOU FOR THE INSIGHT AND FOR THE FOR IN ADVANCE FOR ANY FOLLOW UP YOU CAN PROVIDE YOUR- CASE TURN TO MISS CASTILLO FOR A QUICK SECOND HERE AND WANTED YOU TO JUST TAKE A QUICK. SECOND TO ON THIS- FOR MOST THE RENTERS OUT THERE WHO WERE DEALING WITH- SUB STANDARD LIVING CONDITIONS. IS CAN YOU CAN YOU JUST ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT MORE IN YOUR POINTS SO. IF I'M A TENANT- AND- I LIVE IN A UNIT THAT HAS AN AIR CONDITIONING UNIT BUT THE FILTER ON ITS BUSTED AND THEY CAN'T GET DOWN TO SEVENTY TWO AND- YOU SORT OF JUST KNOW THAT AND- MAYBE YOU'VE GOT A BOX FAN BUT- YOU BASICALLY LIVE. IN END- INSIDE THE HOUSE WHICH I KNOW IS THE CASE FOR- MANY MANY. PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE ESPECIALLY IN OVERCROWDED HOUSING- WEIRD THERE'S EVEN LESS SPACE BUT THERE'S NO RECOURSE UNDER LANDLORD TENANT LAW CURRENTLY UNDER THEIR WARRANTY OF HABITABILITY OR ANY KIND OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE. THAT KIND OF- OF. HABITABLE LIVING CONDITION WHEN IT COMES TO THE ACTUAL TEMPERATURE. THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT AND I THINK YOU KNOW WESTERN CENTER AND HER COLLEAGUES ARE ADVOCATING FOR A COST A POLICY SOLUTION BUT ALSO. SETTING WHICH IS WE NEED TO HAVE RENTAL HOUSING BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN AND AN INDOOR AIR TEMPERATURE AND FOR HEATING IT. HAS BEEN LONG RECOGNIZED AS A HABITABILITY STANDARDS SO FOR EXAMPLE THE CURRENT HABITABILITY CODES AND THE HOME IS. A STANDARD IF THEY DO NOT HAVE. MEANS FOR CHEATING AND THE BUILDING CODE STANDARDS COMMISSION HAS ADOPTED THOSE REGULATIONS TO IMPLEMENT THAT AND SAYING THAT. HOMES MUST BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM ROOM AT. TEMPERATURE OF SEVENTY DEGREES- AT LEAST THREE FEET OFF THE GROUND BUT THERE IS NO HIGHER AND MAX LIMITS. TO THAT AND SO WHAT WE FIND IS THAT NO TENANTS DON'T REALLY HAVE THE RECOURSE IF THEIR HOME IS INCREDIBLE CREDIBILITY- HI. JUST SAY. WHY CAN'T MY IN MY RENTAL UNIT BE COOL- THERE'S NO COOLING MECHANISM IN A RENTAL HOME AND SO I THINK ONE THING THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING ACROSS. THE UNITED STATES AND NOT NECESSARILY FOCUS ON RESILIENCY BUT THERE'S BEEN A MUCH MORE FOCUSED ON THE FACT THAT. YOU KNOW WE NEED TO BE PROTECTING OUR HOMES AND HABITABILITY IS HUGE SO THAT IS OUT OF NEW YORK RELATED TO THAT RECENT FIRE THAT HAPPENED IN JUST THE TRAGEDIES THAT WE'VE SEEN. AS SHOWING THAT LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS AND LOW INCOME FOLKS IN GENERAL HAVE TO WITHSTAND- A LOT MORE ISSUES IN THEIR OWN HOMES. AND WE BELIEVE. A SIMPLE SOLUTION WOULD JUST NEED TO HAVE AN UPWARDS CAP OF WHAT. CAN BE AN AMBIENT TEMPERATURE WITHIN YOUR HOME THAT AND THEREFORE IF WE HAVE THAT UPWARDS CAP. ATTENDANT CAN THEN YOU KNOW REACH OUT TO A CODE INSPECTOR AND SAY MY HOME HAS BEEN. OVER THIS YOU KNOW A HUNDRED DEGREES THIS MANY DAYS IN A ROW AND IT'S INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS- SO OVERALL IT IS A POLICY SOLUTION AND THE VALUE. THAT WE MUST MAINTAIN AN AMBIENT TEMPERATURE AND INFOSYSTEMS- THANK YOU FOR THAT M. WE'LL BE FOLLOWING UP ON THAT ISSUE WITH YOU- BIT BEFORE WE WRAP THIS ONE I DIDN'T WANT TO COME BACK- TO MISTER OF ALL- WHEN YOU'RE IN YOUR RESILIENCE HUB CONCEPT IN THE PROPOSAL. HOW MUCH OF THIS DO YOU DO YOU SORT OF ENVISION IS A NEW BUILT INFRASTRUCTURE AND HOW MUCH OF IT IS. TRYING TO SORT OF. GO THAT IS RIGHT DOWN PUT IT HE SAID. YOU KNOW PEOPLE GO TO WHERE THE BIG PLACE THEY ALREADY KNOW YOU KNOW THEY'VE GOT THEIR STOP AND MAYBE A IS THE GROWTH. STORE BUT IF THERE'S- ARE YOU LOOKING AT EXISTING- EITHER PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE YOU KNOW IF IT'S THE COUNTY LIBRARY BUT ON STEROIDS WHERE IT'S NOT JUST A LIBRARY BUT HAS SOCIAL SERVICES HAS A COMMUNITY CENTER HAS. PUT SO HOW MUCH OF THIS IS YOU SORT OF. NEW GREENFIELD SPACES AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR PROPOSAL HOW MUCH OF IT IS TRYING TO SORT OF IDENTIFY EXISTING ASSETS AND SEE IF WE CAN DO RETROFITS ARE SORT OF IMPROVE ON THEM. HE JUST ELABORATE ON THAT A LITTLE BIT. YEAH HAPPY TO THANKS FOR THAT QUESTION- IT IT'S- WE'RE TAKING A BOAT AND STRATEGY SO IN SOME COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY THINKING ABOUT THE BAY AREA IN OAKLAND AND RICHMOND WHERE WHERE WHERE CAN I THINK. WILL REALLY BE ABOUT BOLSTERING RETROFITTING EXISTING COMMUNITY INSTITUTIONS AND BUILDINGS. LIKE LIBRARIES YOUTH AND SENIOR CENTER IS NONPROFIT. AND ALSO THOSE CRITICAL ON A PUBLIC FACILITIES THAT ARE OWNED BY THE CITY OR COUNTY AND MISTER MACALLAN WAS SHARING SO. IN SOME CASES IT IS SORT OF THEIR COLLABORATION WITH. PUBLIC COMMUTE. THROUGH PUBLIC COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS AS YOU WERE SAYING AND SOMETIMES SOMETIMES THAT A NONPROFIT. RATHER FACILITY BUT- WE REALLY DO WANT TO INVEST AT AND SORT OF- BOLSTERED THAT KIND OF EXISTING BUILDINGS THAT ALREADY EXIST. IN MANY WAYS ARE OPERATING ON A TIGHT BUDGET. AND HAVE DETERIORATING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT NEED DEEP REPAIRS- AND UPGRADES- HOWEVER WE'RE KNOWLEDGE IN WORKING WITH PARTNERS. THAT WRE UNITED IN RURAL COMMUNITIES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT FOR SOME COMMUNITY THEY DON'T HAVE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE AND WE NEED TO ALSO GO BEYOND IN. BECAUSE THERE'S NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL MODEL CALIFORNIA IS SUCH A DIVERSE STATE. IN SOME COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY RURAL AREAS THEY MAY NEED PROPERTY UPGRADES AND NEW CONSTRUCTION. OR THESE BUILDING THEMSELVES TO BE CREATED AND SO WE WANT TO CREATE FLEXIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT COMMUNITIES. ARE REALLY DRY AND WHAT THOSE FACILITY WHERE THOSE FACILITIES ARE LOCATED WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE AND WHETHER IT'S RETROFITTING OR NEW CONSTRUCTION. AND MAKE SURE THAT. UNITY DRIVEN PROCESS. IN THAT IT ACROSS THE VISION AND- OF THESE PRO- BUT I IT NOW THAT. GIVEN APPROACH WE SEE A CRITICAL ROLE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT OTHER CITY AND COUNTY- OFFICIALS TO COLLABORATE WITH US ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE HUGE THAT OF PUBLIC BUILDINGS AVAILABLE CHIU SORT OF LEVERAGE WITH THEIR- PUBLIC PROCESS HE AND INVESTED. THANKS FOR THAT APPRECIATE THE INSIGHT- I KNOW WILL BE- FOLLOWING US UP ALSO WITH- MISPRONOUNCE ON ON THE EXTREME HEAT RANKING PROPOSAL- I KNOW THERE'S MEMBERS OF THE ADMINISTRATION THE WAITING BUT I WILL JUST SAY- TO THE FOLKS AT GREEN LINING AND EVERYONE HAS BEEN WORKING ON ON THAT EFFORT AS WELL AS YOUR- LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION AND% EFFICIENCY PROGRAMMING WILL BE LEANING ON YOUR EXPERTISE- IN THE WEEKS AND MONTHS TO COME HERE SO. SAID TO ALL THE PANELISTS FOR SIGNING IN AND WE DO APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY- LET'S GO TO OUR FINAL PANEL WHICH WILL BE A SHORT ONE AND THEN WE'LL WE'LL TURN TO PUBLIC COMMENT BUT- SHORT PANEL BUT INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT PEOPLE- SO WITH US WE HAVE. SOME OF THE TOP PUBLIC HEALTH AND WORK FOR SAFETY OFFICIALS IN THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- SO FIRST WE HAVE DOCTOR WROTE HAN RADHAKRISHNA WHO IS BOTH A PUBLIC HEALTH- AND HE'S THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF HEALTH EQUITY WITHIN CITY PH OUR DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH- ALONGSIDE. DR RATHER. WE ALSO HAVE- DIP DEBRA LEE WHO'S THE DEPUTY CHIEF SAFETY. OFFICER FOR DIVISION OF OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY ALSO KNOWN AS CAL OSHA- AS WELL AS- DAVID HORNUNG WHO HANDLES THE HEAT AGRICULTURE PROGRAMMING- AT THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS- SO LET'S START OFF WITH YOU DR RADHAKRISHNAN AND- PLEASE TAKE IT AWAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. THANK YOU SO MUCH CHAIR STERN VICE CHAIR RODRIGUEZ AND MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TODAY. MY NAME IS ROSE ANOTHER TRADITIONALLY SERVED AS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF CDPH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH LEADING ITS OFFICE OF HEALTH EQUITY. BEGIN BY DESCRIBING SOME OF THE HEALTH IMPACTS AND EXTREME HEAT EXPOSURE. THEN DESCRIBE HOW CDPH PROVIDE SUPPORT DURING EXTREME HEAT EVENTS THROUGH SEVERAL PROGRAMS AND FINALLY WILL GIVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE RECENTLY PROPOSED BUDGET I AM ON SURVEILLANCE. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH COLLABORATIVELY WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE PARTNERS. MANY OF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS INCLUDING OUR MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATOR HAVE NOTED THAT TREMENDOUS HEALTH IMPACTS OF HEAT SOME ARE SILENT SOME ARE INVISIBLE HE GOES BEYOND CRAMPS AND RASHES INSTRUCTOR EXHAUSTION AND DEATH. IT'S ASSOCIATED WITH HOSPITALIZATIONS FOR MANY CAUSES RENAL FAILURE DEHYDRATION MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES DIABETES IT INCREASES ADVERSE BIRTH OUTCOMES SUCH AS PRETERM BIRTH AND LOW-BIRTH WEIGHT. WHAT PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE IS THAT ALSO INCREASES AND WORSENS MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS INCLUDING SELF INJURY AND SUICIDE AS WELL AS UNINTENTIONAL INJURY IN HOMICIDE. WAVES AND DROUGHTS ALSO IMPACT VECTOR BORNE FOOD BORNE WATERBORNE IN SOIL BORNE INFECTIOUS DISEASE WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN HEAT RELATED ILLNESS AND DEATH. CLIMATE CHANGE AFFECTS EVERY CALIFORNIAN BUT SOME COMMUNITIES AND INDIVIDUALS MORE THAN OTHERS AS NOTED BY MANY OF OUR PREVIOUS WITNESS. EXISTING HEALTH CONDITIONS THOSE INADEQUATELY HOUSED OUTDOOR WORKERS COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IMMIGRANTS THE YOUNG THE ELDERLY PREGNANT TO THOSE WITH DISABILITIES THOSE WITH LOW INCOMES AND THOSE WHO ARE SOCIALLY ISOLATED EXPERIENCE DISPROPORTIONATE HARM. NEXT I'D LIKE TO DESCRIBE CD PEACHES RESPONSE DURING EXTREME HEAT EVENTS WHICH TOUCHES ON MULTIPLE DIVISIONS WITHIN OUR DEPARTMENT INCLUDING EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS OVERSIGHT OF HEALTH CARE FACILITIES OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH. AND CLAMOR CHANGING MCCARTY. FIRST CDPH IS ENVIRONMENTAL EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS OFFICE DISSEMINATES INFORMATION TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND EMERGENCY NETWORKS IN COORDINATES COMMUNICATIONS THROUGH. THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH ALERT NETWORK. THIS OFFICE ALSO PROVIDES FACT SHEETS AND WEB BASED CONTENT FOR THE PUBLIC IT INCLUDES INFORMATION FOR PRIORITY POPULATIONS LIKE THE ELDERLY AND THE ON HOW. SECOND CDPH BECAUSE OF LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAM THAT SUPPORTS THE SAFETY AND CONTINUITY OF CARE FOR PATIENTS AND RESIDENTS OF FACILITIES THAT LICENSES DURING HEAT RELATED EMERGENCIES. BE ADVISED FACILITIES ON BEST PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES MONARCHY RELATED OCCURRENCES AND INVESTIGATE COMPLAINTS. THIRD CD PH HAS AN OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH BRANCH THAT TRACKS DATA ON OCCUPATIONAL HEAT RELATED EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS USING HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATIVE DATA ENTRY RELATED ILLNESSES REPORTED TO THE CALIFORNIA WORKERS COMPENSATION INFORMATION SYSTEM WORKERS OR FILE A COMPLAINT WITH CAL OSHA IF THEY BECOME AWARE OF THE HEAT ON THE SITUATION YOU'LL HEAR MORE FROM THOSE COLLEAGUES CHANGE AND HEALTH EQUITY SECTION WHICH I OVERSEE THAT MAINTAINS THE CLIMATE CHANGE AND HEALTH VULNERABILITY INDICATORS WHICH INCLUDES PROJECTED FUTURE EXTREME HEAT DAYS BY CENSUS TRACT AND COUNTY. WITHIN CALIFORNIA AND THIS IS BASED ON TEMPERATURES FROM CLIMATE MODELS DEVELOPED CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE ASSESSMENT. THE DATA IS AVAILABLE THROUGH AN ONLINE MAPPING PLATFORM TO PROJECT EXTREME HEAT DAYS AND OTHER VULNERABILITY INDICATORS AS WELL AS A DOCTOR THE PASADENA. WE ALSO PROVIDE TECHNICAL INPUT ON THE CALIFORNIA HE ASSESSMENT TOOL CHAT AND THAT WAS FUNDED THROUGH THE FOURTH ASSESS. WHICH PROVIDES HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED DATA LUNCH HE SAYS IT'S A MAPPING PLATFORM THAT PROVIDES DATA ON FUTURE HE RISKS AND IDENTIFIES VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND PROVIDES RESOURCES FOR ACTION. DATA ON HEAT RELATED ILLNESSES AND DEATHS ARE MADE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE CHIU SEX FIRST AT THE CENTER CDPH IS INJURY AND VIOLENCE PREVENTION BRANCH PUBLISHES DATA ON CALIFORNIA'S HEAT RELATED DEATHS ON THE CENTER WHICH IS A DATA QUERY WEBSITE. ALLOWS USERS TO CREATE TABLES FOR A VARIETY OF TOPICS INCLUDING HEAT RELATED DEATHS A YEAR. JOHN T. AGE AND RACE AND ETHNICITY. SECOND TRACKING CALIFORNIA. DATA ON DEATHS HOSPITALIZATIONS EMERGENCY VISITS. RELATED ILLNESS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE THROUGH TRACKING CALIFORNIA'S WEBSITE REASON USERS CAN VIEW A NUMBER OF RAPES BY COUNTY YEAR AGE SEX. RACE AND ETHNICITY THIS IS A PROGRAM FUNDED BY THE PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE. THROUGH THE CDC'S NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH RACKING PROGRAM IN PARTNERSHIP WITH CDPH. FINALLY I'D LIKE TO MENTION AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET A PROPOSAL TO INITIATE SURVEILLANCE ACROSS CALIFORNIA TO BETTER DETECT CLIMATE CHANGE RELATED HEALTH OUTCOMES EARLY IN NEAR REAL TIME TO PLAN AND MOBILIZE LOCAL FIRST RESPONDERS AND OTHER RESOURCES TO REACH VULNERABLE PEOPLE AND PREVENT FURTHER ILLNESS INJURY OR DEATH. THE PRIMARY MECHANISM FOR EARLY DETECTION OF CLIMATE CHANGE RELATED HEALTH CONDITIONS WILL BE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL'S BIO SENSE NATIONAL SYNDROMIC SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM AND S. S. P. STAFF WOULD WORK WITH EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA REPORTING HEALTH SURVEILLANCE DATA TO ENROLL AND TRAIN THEM. TO REPORT RELATED IN THE STATE AT PROVIDING INTENSIVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT. EVERY CHIEF COMPLAINT AND DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS FROM AN ENROLLED EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT WOULD ENSURE THE SYSTEM WITHIN ABOUT TWENTY FOUR HOURS THE PATIENT IS. FUNDS WOULD BE USED TO HELP UPGRADE SYSTEMS FOR DATA REPORTING ANALYSIS DISPLAY COMMUNICATIONS AUTOMATED DATA TRANSFER ANALYSIS AND SHARING AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WITH STATE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND THE PUBLIC. SYSTEM COULD ALSO BE USED FOR A VARIETY OF OTHER HEALTH OUTCOMES OUTSIDE OF SHE IN OUTSIDE OF CLIMATE RELATED CONDITIONS. CURRENTLY CDPH CAN ONLY PROVIDE TRACKING OF HEAT RELATED HEALTH OUTCOMES WITH THE WAGON TIME ABOUT ONE YEAR. SYNDROMIC SURVEILLANCE WOULD PROVIDE NEAR REAL TIME DATA TO IDENTIFY HEAT ILLNESSES WITH THE GOAL OF MONITORING TRACKING IN ORDER TO ULTIMATELY RESPOND QUICKLY BUT ULTIMATELY PERFECT. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD UTILIZE THE EXISTING BIOSENSOR PLATFORM OF THE CDC AND RESULTS WOULD START TO BE SEEN WITHIN THE YEAR AFTER THE PROGRAM IS SET UP INDEED AGREEMENTS ARE SIGNED HOWEVER IT WILL REQUIRE TIME TO REACH ON BOARD TRAIN IMPLEMENTED DATA USER AGREEMENTS. AND PRACTICES WITH THE FACILITIES TO BE COMPLETE SO WE WOULD BE GETTING BY ENROLLING THE APPROXIMATELY FORTY FIVE FACILITIES THAT ARE ALREADY INVOLVED ACROSS EIGHTEEN COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA. THERE'S A SEPARATE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL AS WELL FOR ONE TIME FUNDING OF TWENTY FIVE MILLION TO ESTABLISH CLIMATE CHANGE AND HEALTH RESILIENCY GRANT PLANNING PROGRAM. IN COLLABORATION WITH LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND TRIBES AND ONE COMPONENT OF RESILIENCE PLANS AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL COULD BE TO COORDINATE THE PREVENTION AND REDUCTION OF HEALTH IMPACTS OF INCREASED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS- THANK YOU DR- WHAT WILL COME BACK- BUT SAID LET'S HEAR FROM OTHER TWO PANELISTS- THINK FIRST UP WE'RE GONNA HAVE- I SEE YOU THERE ON THE SCREEN DAVID SO WHY DON'T YOU GO WITH.

THE THIRD IS THROUGH. APPLE APPLE INVESTIGATION THESE ARE TARGETED INSPECTIONS OF INTERSTATES WHERE THERE IS A HEIGHTENED RISKS OF INJURY AND ILLNESSES AND INJURIES TO WORKERS. AB ARE IN FOR STATE EFFORTS WE DEVELOP A SPECIAL INTERESTS THIS PROGRAM SHOULD DRESS HOUSEHLDS THIS INCLUDES ENHANCED INSPECTION PROTOCOLS WHEN RESPONDING TO REPORTS OF HEAT RELATED ILLNESSES AND COMPLAINTS COLLEGE IT DOESN'T WAIT FOR THE TEMPERATURE TO REACH A CERTAIN NUMBER. IN ORDER TO CONDUCT HIGH HEAT INSPECTION- CARRIED OUT TARGETED IN FORCE THAT LEADS. YEARS OF HIGH TO ENSURE EMPLOYERS ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE HEAT ILLNESS PREVENTION STANDARD BETWEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE HELLO SHE CONDUCTED ABOUT THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED INSPECTIONS ANNUALLY. ZAGWE TEMPLARS COMPLIANCE WITH THE KEEP ILLNESS PREVENTION REGULATIONS RESULTING IN MORE THAN TWELVE BILLION. DOLLARS IN TOTAL PENALTIES. HELLO SHE IS DEAD TO BRING CALIFORNIA FROM EXTRA HEAT IN THE WORK. IN THE COMING YEARS PLAN ON AND EXPANDING OUR EXISTING TRACKING MECHANISM AND REGION YOU CAN PROCESS FOR ALL K<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; RELATED&lt;/c&gt;</u> INSPECTIONS WHICH WILL HELP US DRAW INSIGHTS ON TRENDS IN COMPLAINTS AND REPORTED INJURIES. AS WELL AS PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE OUR COMPLAINT INTAKE AND OUR INSPECTION PROCESS. WE ARE ALSO EXPLORING WAYS TO IMPROVE OUR COMPLAINT TRACKING PROCESS AND INCLUDE AND THAT'S POSSIBLY INCLUDING AUTOMATING THE SYSTEM. I WOULD ALSO STATE THAT COUNTS ARE CURRENTLY IN SPORTS IS INDOOR HE THREW THE TITLE EIGHT SECTION THIRTY TWO OR THREE BY ENSURING THAT EMPLOYERS HAVE A PROGRAM IN PLACE THAT RECOGNIZE THESE HOUSES. AND EFFECTIVE INJURY AND ILLNESS PREVENTION PROGRAM IMPROVES SAFETY AND HEALTH IN THE WORKPLACE IT REDUCES WORKERS INJURIES AND ILLNESSES. STAFFING IS A PRIORITY HELLO CHAU. DECREASING OUR VACANCY RATE IS AND HAS BEEN A TOP PRIORITY TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE MORE SAFETY ENGINEERS AND INDUSTRIAL HYGIENIST IN THE FIELD CONDUCTING INSPECTIONS. WE HAVE MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS IN TWENTY TWENTY WE HIRED FORTY NEW STAFF AND IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT NUMBER TRIPLED TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY HIRES ACROSS THE DIVISION. WE WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THIS MOMENTUM. IT BEFORE CLOSING I LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE TINA MOSHE WHO SHOWS THEIR DEDICATION AND PASSION EVERY DAY TO KEEP CALIFORNIANS SAFE AND WORK. AND IT IS AN HONOR TO BE A PART OF THIS ORGANIZATION AND I APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT OUR WORK. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. DAVID AND I ARE AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU DEFINITELY. I WOULD APPRECIATE IT- MY FIRST QUESTION IS FOR- ACTUALLY- DR RADHAKRISHNAN IF YOU'RE STILL WITHUS WE'D MAYBE CAN COME BACK TO THE I. R. N. AS IN A MOMENT HERE BUT- YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN. BEEN A NUMBER OF REPORTS AND- IN SOME FRUSTRATION AROUND THE DATA THAT I THINK YOU YOU ACTUALLY WENT. VERY USEFUL INSIGHT ON. ESPECIALLY AS YOU SORT OF GIVE A LITTLE MORE DETAIL ABOUT. WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S PLANS. IS LOOKING LIKE FOR THIS COMING YEAR AND A BIT OF THE CENTRAL ISSUE AROUND LAG TIME IN TERMS OF REAL TIME DATA VERSUS- SORT OF RETRO SPECK A RETROACTIVE DATA- YOU KNOW THE REPORTS WE SAW IS THAT- WE HAD REPORTS OF HEAT RELATED DEATHS IN THE HUNDREDS OVER A DECADE. I THINK THAT THE NUMBERS FIVE HUNDRED NINETY DEATHS BUT THAT- WHEN YOU TAKE A DEEPER LOOK AT THE NUMBERS AND HOW PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY AND BEING IMPACTED THE NUMBERS REALLY IN THE- THE MANY THOUSANDS- HEY WE REMEDY THAT THAT SORT OF. THAT COUNTING- GAP IT IN TERMS OF HOW WE ACTUALLY GET TO THE DATA AND IS NOW THE QUESTION OF HOW FAST WE CAN GET THAT DATA TO THE PUBLIC OR IS THERE SOME SORT OF. IS THERE A DEEPER UNDERLYING- CHALLENGE IN ACTUALLY- ATTRIBUTING- THESE KIND OF HEALTH RELATED INCIDENTS TO THE- SORT OF. EGGS YOU KNOW AMBIENT FACTORS LIKE HEAT- LIKE A WILD FIRE I MEAN I JUST KNOW FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. IN HAVING MY GRANDPARENTS EVACUATE DURING THE WILL THE FIRE AND- THEY SAT ON THEIR OUT OF THIS HIGHWAY LOCKED INTO THEIR CAR FOR EIGHT HOURS IN. THE TROM OF THAT EVENT THEN THAT DAY LEAD MY GRANDFATHER TO THE I SEE YOU AND HE WASN'T REALLY SUPPOSED TO BE MOVED AND TRANSPORTED BUT HAD TO BE IN THAT INCIDENT SO. AND OVER THERE I SEE YOU AND THEN THREE MONTHS LATER BECAUSE OF RELATED COMPLICATIONS- WE DIDN'T WE LOST HIM AND- YOU KNOW THAT THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY ATTRIBUTE TO SAY THAT WILDFIRE EMERGENCY BUT I THINK OF SIMILAR SITUATIONS OF SOMEBODY'S GOING THROUGH A HEATING VENT. AND THEY START HAVING HEART ISSUES BUT MAYBE IT DOESN'T EMERGE THAT DAY OR THEY DON'T HAVE A CATASTROPHIC STROKE BUT SOMETHING SOMETHING CHANGES- THAT THAT THROUGH THAT TRAUMA OF THAT PARTICULAR. DAY OR THAT PARTICULAR INCIDENT SO. I IS IT IS A ABOUT IS IT REPORTING FUNCTION THAT WE NEED TO SOLVE OR IS THE IS THAT THAT BASIC DIAGNOSIS SOMETHING THAT WE JUST AREN'T. WE DON'T HAVE THE DATA NECESSARILY IN OUR SYSTEM- TO SHOW US AND TO SHOW THE PUBLIC FRANKLY WHO SUFFERING. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SENATOR STERN AND ALSO FOR SHARING THE STORY ABOUT YOUR GRANDFATHER IT HIGHLIGHTS THE TRAUMA AND THE MENTAL IMPACT. FOR THE SURVIVORS AS WELL AS THE PERSON HARM NOT TO MENTION THE PHYSICAL IMPACT. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IN THE CLIMATE AND HEALTH SURVEILLANCE IS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS BOTH ISSUES THAT YOU RAISED. ACCURACY AND TIMELINESS AS YOU NOTED THE CHIEF COMPLAINT WHEN SOMEONE WALKS IN THE DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS WHEN SOMEBODY LEAVES WHAT'S NOTED ON A DEATH CERTIFICATE. MAY NOT HAVE THE WORD KEEPS SHOWING ON BYE BYE TRIANGULATED IN THAT INFORMATION WE CAN HAVE MORE ACCURATE AND COMPLETE DATA TO USE THE EXAMPLE SOMEONE MAY COME IN WITH CODING. BUT DIED OF ACUTE HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE. AND SO TO USE A BROADER TERMS WITH THE ICD TEN INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASE. CAPTURES A MORE BROADER NET OF CONDITIONS RELATED TO HEAT CAN ALLOW US TO BE MORE ACCURATE IN CAPTURING THE TRUE BURDEN. AND THEN OF COURSE TIMELINESS IS ESSENTIAL NOT JUST ACCOUNT MUCH TO MITIGATE INTEL COMMITTEE PREVENT. THE PROPOSAL THAT I DESCRIBED IS DESIGNED. TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. THANK YOU FOR THAT IN- AND I SURE THROUGH THE BY PROCESS WILL BE SCRUTINY SCRUTINIZING AND GREATER DETAIL BUT- YOU CAN COUNT ON ME FOR- VERY CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT AND I APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION THERE TO. TO FILLING THIS GAP AND AS YOU MENTIONED I THINK YOU SAID FORTY FIVE FACILITIES THAT ARE ALREADY PLUGGED INTO BIOSENSOR WILL BE ABLE TO SHOW PEOPLE SOONER THAN LATER AND GET THAT MOVING QUICKLY WHILE WE BUILD OUT THE REST OF THE DATE INFRASTRUCTURE AND GET THOSE AGREEMENTS SIGNED SOUNDS LIKE A- PRUDENT- WAY TO. ATTACK THIS ISSUE- IN A TIMELY MANNER- AS WELL SO THANK YOU FOR THAT MY OTHER QUESTION WAS FOR. I THINK DOCTOR LEE ALTHOUGH IT MAY BE FOR I'M SORRY DIRECTOR LEE AND THAT HE LEAVE OR OR MISTER HORN ON- NANCY SENATOR BROUGHT THIS UP ON A PAST PANEL OR ABOUT THE CONDITIONS THAT. DOMESTIC WORKERS FACE INDOORS- WE KNOW THAT THERE'S THE HISTORIC WORK THAT WAS DONE ON SORT OF THE OUTDOOR HEAT STANDARD- FOR EVERYONE AS THE LABOR OUTSIDE- ELEMENTS BEEN SUBJECT IN HUMANE- AND VERY UNSAFE CONDITIONS BUT- WE KNOW THERE THERE'S BEEN NO ADOPTION OF AN INDOOR HEAT STANDARD CAN YOU. SHARE ANY INSIGHT ON ON THOSE ISSUES THAT THAT EFFECT- MASTIC WORKERS LIKE MR NAGLE WAS TALKING ABOUT- FOR- LIKE MRS THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT- AS THE INDOOR CONDITIONS AT HER WORKPLACE SAY. AT THE AMAZON WAREHOUSE. IN DON'T HAVE YOU START. YEAH THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION ABOUT THE ASPECT OF THE INDOOR HEATING WHERE THAT IS IN THE RULEMAKING PROCESS AS AS DEBRA MENTIONED WE DO HAVE REGULATIONS CURRENTLY WHICH WERE ABLE TO ENFORCE TO DRESS THE HAZARD AND INDOOR HEAT WHATEVER IT'S NOT AS SPECIFIC AS WHAT PERHAPS AGE REGULATIONS SPECIFIC TO HIM OR HE- WOULD BE- THAT. REGULATION IS IN THEIR OWN MAKING PROCESS RIGHT NOW IT'S A PROCESS IT'S FAIRLY COMPLEX. WE STARTED THE ROLE MAKING PROCESS ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO WE'VE CONVENE AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEETING WITHOUT THREE PUBLIC MEETINGS ON AT. TEN SEVEN DIFFERENT DRAFTS THE REGULATIONS THIS POINT. AND I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT IN OCTOBER AT DRAFT WAS SENT OVER TO THE OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH STANDARDS FOR. WHICH IS THE BODY THAT CRUZ TALISA REGULATIONS. OUR WORK WE'RE HOPEFUL TO GET IT BACK FROM THEM SOON WITH COMMENTS FROM THEM THEN WILL TAKE ANOTHER. PASS AT IT BEFORE SENDING IT BACK TO THEM. WHERE THEY WILL THEN VOTE ON IT ONE OF THEIR MONTHLY MEETINGS. AND WE HOPE THEN IT WILL GO THROUGH THE PROCESS PUBLIC COMMENT. AND THAT THE PAST EVENTUALLY THROUGH THE OFFICE ADMINISTRATOR LAN SECRETARY OF STATE- TO BE PASSED AND IMPLEMENTED BY US. CAN YOU GIVE US A LITTLE BETTER SENSE THAT ONE TIME LINE I MEAN WE KNOW WE KNOW THIS STANDARD IS REQUIRED BE PROMULGATED BY LAW AND IT'S BEEN LOST ON THE BOOK FOR. A FEW YEARS NOW- IS THAT IS THIS YEAR KIND OF NOTICE AND COMMENT PROCESS THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT OR YOU COULD THIS SPENT ON- INTO TWENTY THREE. AND UNFORTUNATELY I CAN ONLY SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF THE TIME FRAMES IN THE OVERALL PROCESS. CAN'T BE ROUTED TO THE TENTATIVE DATE OF WHEN IT WILL BE. PAST YOU KNOW WE ARE EAGER TO HAVE A INDOOR- HILLS PREVENTION REGULATION IT'S IMPORTANT CALLOUS SETS AND- WE'VE GOT A LOT OF EFFORT INTO GETTING THE REGULATION RIGHT. AND JUST SO I'M CLEAR THE VERY STRAPS AND THIS SORT OF THE WAY IT'S BEEN ITERATED RIGHT NOW. IT IS IT'S CURRENTLY UNDER REVIEW SO THAT'S NOT YET A PUBLIC NOTICE ON THAT PROPOSAL BUT ONCE THAT REVIEW IS COMPLETE THAT INITIAL DRAFT PUBLICATION WILL BE. YEAH WELL WILL BE THAT'LL BE OUR FIRST ABILITY TO LOOK AT IT THAT IS THAT ABOUT RIGHT. ACTUALLY THAT THE DRAFT REGULATION IS UP ONLINE RIGHT NOW YOU CAN SEE IT ON OUR ON ALL RULEMAKING PAGE. IT WILL GO TO NOTICE AFTER THE STANDARDS BOARD WHICH IS IF THEY BALK TO IMPROVE IT. AND THAT WOULD IS WHAT WOULD START THE FORTY FIVE DAY PUBLIC ONE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SENATORS PERSPECTIVE- I WHICH YOU- AND EXPEDITIOUS BUT STILL YOU KNOW- THOUGHTFUL PROCESS IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE- TAKEN A LOT OF TIME TO THINK IS THIS THROUGH A COULD HAVE MASSIVE IMPLICATIONS BUT- WE'RE REALLY COUNTING ON YOU. AT THE PART OF INVESTOR RELATIONS OVERALL- TO NOT JUST YOU KNOW THINK ABOUT THE OUTSIDE BUT- IN EVERYBODY'S HOMES AND IN THE PLACES THAT MAYBE WE DON'T OFTEN THINK OF- YOU KNOW THE PLACES THAT. I'M YOU KNOW MISSING AGAIN THE COMMUNITIES THAT SHE WORKS FOR OUT IN SAN GABRIEL VALLEY WHO WERE. YOU KNOW OUT OF SIGHT AND OUT OF MINE BUT STILL HAVE CHALLENGES SO- LOOK FORWARD TO FEEDBACK THERE AND WILL BE REVIEWING THE THAT DRAFT AS WE MOVE ALONG HERE. I'M DO WE HAVE. ANY OTHER. YESTERDAY YES THERE WERE AT LEAST. REALLY YEAH PLEASE JUMP. IT IS Y. TO HAVE ONE OTHER THAT- TO ECHO MY COWORKERS AND THAT IS COUNTY BOARD CHILD. HELLO RECOGNIZES THATINDOOR HE IS VERY IS A VERY SERIOUS PASSAGE. AND AS I STATED IN MY OPENING- WE ARE LOOKING AT AND FORCING IN YOUR SEATS WITH OUR THIRTY TWO OR THREE- REGULATION. AND LOOKING AT THOSE INDUSTRIES SUCH AS WAREHOUSES AT OTHER MANUFACTURING AS WELL AS FOUNDRIES AND OTHER OPERATIONS WHERE. THE HEAT AND OR ITS HEIGHT AND MOVING FORWARD- WE'RE LOOKING AT AS I MENTIONED ABOUT TARGETING CERTAIN AREAS IN CERTAIN INDUSTRIES THAT PRODUCES- AND COULD CONTRIBUTE- INJURIES TO WORKERS. AND SO I JUST WANTED TO. ENSURE THAT WE ARE AS A TRAVEL SHOW LOOKING AFTER. AND DOING THOSE TYPES OF. INSPECTIONS THAT WE WILL GO IN TO LOOK AT IT WILL BE EVALUATING EMPLOYERS- RECOGNITION AND IDENTIFYING OF THE STATUS OF HAZARDS IN THEIR WORKPACE AND WHAT ACTIONS THEY ARE TAKING TO ADDRESS THOSE THINGS- SUCH AS INDOOR HEAT. AT A PREVIOUS THAT IN AND TO THE EXTENT- YOU CAN BRING THIS COMMITTEE BACK OR SHARE HOW THAT INSPECTION PROCESS GOING ON I'M SURE IT ALSO OCCURRED THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS BUT- TO SEE WHAT THOSE IN IT THAT INITIAL ROUND OF INSPECTIONS IS YIELDING- BOTH THROUGH THE- YOU KNOW YOUR PROACTIVE EFFORTS AS WELL AS THE- THE COMPLAINT NETWORK THAT YOU BILL- HOPEFULLY PEOPLE ACTUALLY. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS. OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY HAVE THEIR VOICE HEARD FINALLY ON THE CONDITIONS THEY ARE FACING AND- USED THE STANDARD TO ENSURE THEIR PUBLIC HEALTH IS PROTECTED SO WE DO APPRECIATE THAT- TYPICALLY- I LOOKED AT MY CAR. FOR A FOR COMMENT REQUEST. NO I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU ALL THE PAN FOR TAKING THE TODAY. TO GIVE US THEIR INSIGHTS ON ON SOME OF THE STRATEGIES THAT WE CAN LOOK FORWARD TO IN TRYING TO DEALING WITH HEAT. THESE HE EMERGED EMERGENCIES AND ALSO- KEEPING THE PUBLIC SAFE OUT THERE- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US AS I STATED BEFORE TO ESTABLISH A BASE BECAUSE ALL OF THE STRATEGIES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT DEPEND ON A COUPLE OF RESOURCES- ONE OF THEM BEING WATERED ONE OF BEING ELECTRICITY- SO. IF WE DON'T TIE THOSE TWO TOGETHER AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT- SOME OF THE SHORTAGES THAT WE HAVE AND- INEFFICIENCY THAT WE HAVE IN THOSE RESPECTS FOR THE STATE- ALL THIS CAN BE FOR NOT SO- I LOOK FORWARD TO THE- WORKING ON THIS IN THE FUTURE WITH- ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES AND- BOTH THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT THE FINAL NOTE AND I YOU KNOW WE HAD WE DID HAVE A PANEL- LOOKING AT UTILITIES IN EXTREME HEAT BOTH ON THE WATER AND POWER SIDE OF SUCH A PACT HEARING BUT I WILL SAY THAT IS AN INDISPENSABLE PART OF THE WORK AND GREATER RESILIENCE DURING THOSE MOMENTS WHEN HE STRAINS- YOU KNOW ARE NOT JUST OUR TRANSMISSION SYSTEM BUT OUR GAS PLANTS THE ABILITY TO RAMP CYCLE DOWN. WATER PUMPING TECHNOLOGY I'M ALL THAT SO VERY MUCH- SHOULD BE PART OF IN LOOKS TO BE IN THE EXTREME HEAT STRATEGY FROM THE GOVERNOR BUT- WILL BE HOPING FOR YOU KNOW JUST MORE DETAIL OUT OF THAT IN THE WEEKS TO COME SO- DO APPRECIATE THE PANELISTS TESTIMONY. APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THE ADMINISTRATION FROM TESTIFYING AND WITH THAT I WANT TO OPEN IT UP TO THE PUBLIC COMMENTS SO- LET ME SEE- I KNOW I GAVE THE NUMBER AT THE- OUTSET- BUT- DUE TO CONSTRAINTS REGARDING THE LENGTH O THE HEARINGS AND- ALL THE TECHNOLOGY CONSIDERATION THE CLEANING PROTOCOLS. WE WILL HAVE TO ASK FOR SOME TIME LIMIT ON TESTIMONY- SO WE'RE GONNA ASK FOR. A MINUTE EACH AT THIS POINT. AND WE CAN BEGIN WITH TESTIMONY FROM ANYONE WHO'S HERE IN THE GALLERY BUT I DON'T SEE. ANY WITNESSES HERE IN PERSON- SO LET'S MOVE TO WITNESSES POTENTIALLY WAITING ON THE- TELECONFERENCE SERVICE TO PROVIDE. COMMENT MODERATE IF YOU PLEASE PROBABLY INDIVIDUALS WAITING PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT WE CAN GET STARTED.
