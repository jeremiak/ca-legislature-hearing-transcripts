CLAIMS.

00:46:07.498 --> 00:46:08.765
IT'S SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE THAT

AND I ALWAYS ENJOY THESE EVENTS.

00:49:35.172 --> 00:49:36.807
BUT SOMETIMES IT SEEMS THAT WE

00:49:36.873 --> 00:49:39.576
SANITIZE HISTORY IN A WAY THAT

00:49:39.643 --> 00:49:41.178

FIRST IN FOUR MONTHS CENTER

00:49:56.893 --> 00:49:58.161
TRAVIS WAS A LABOR LEADER.

00:49:58.228 --> 00:50:01.264
HIS ENTIRE GOAL OF ORGANIZING

00:50:01.331 --> 00:50:03.200
WAS TO PROTECT WORKERS.

00:50:03.266 --> 00:50:04.868
AND NOT JUST ANY WORKERS THE

00:50:04.935 --> 00:50:06.937
MOST VULNERABLE WORKERS IN OUR

00:50:07.003 --> 00:50:10.040
COMMUNITY AND IN OUR NATION.

00:50:10.107 --> 00:50:12.342
WE HAVE HAD A LOT OF DEBATES ON

00:50:12.409 --> 00:50:13.577
FARMWORKERS ON THIS FLOOR SINCE

00:50:13.643 --> 00:50:15.545

HISTORY WE LIKE TO TALK ABOUT.

00:50:19.616 --> 00:50:21.318

THEY ARE NOT TREATED EQUALLY.

00:50:34.264 --> 00:50:36.032
IN MOST STATES THEY STILL DON'T

00:50:36.099 --> 00:50:37.534
HAVE THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE.

00:50:37.601 --> 00:50:38.602
THEY DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO

00:50:38.668 --> 00:50:40.170
MINIMUM WAGE.

00:50:40.237 --> 00:50:41.705

00:50:41.772 --> 00:50:43.240

00:59:59.062 --> 01:00:00.430
AND POWERLESS AND SOME FOLKS

01:00:00.496 --> 01:00:03.299
EYES AT TO TREMENDOUS COURAGE.

01:00:03.366 --> 01:00:04.300
IT TOOK COURAGE TO LIVE ONE'S

01:00:04.367 --> 01:00:05.635
COMMITMENT TO HELP THOSE

01:00:05.702 --> 01:00:07.570
INDIVIDUALS TO ACHIEVE WHAT WAS

01:00:07.637 --> 01:00:09.105
NECESSARY IN THE FEELS.

01:00:09.172 --> 01:00:11.708
AND TO GIVE THEM A LEADER AND A

01:00:11.774 --> 01:00:13.042
VOICE THAT WAS UNAFRAID.

01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:13.676
AND OBVIOUSLY TOOK COURAGE TO

01:00:13.743 --> 01:00:14.978
WALK WITH DELIVERANCE AND SIMPLY

01:00:15.044 --> 01:00:16.179
TAKE ACTIONS WERE ACTION WAS

01:00:16.245 --> 01:00:18.081
NEEDED.

01:00:18.147 --> 01:00:19.182
MY ANGELO SAYS THAT IT IS

01:00:19.248 --> 01:00:21.517
IMPOSSIBLE TO ACTUALLY LIVE OUT

01:00:21.584 --> 01:00:22.885
THE VALUES OF YOUR LIFE WITHOUT

01:00:22.952 --> 01:00:24.120
COURAGE.

01:00:24.187 --> 01:00:25.188
BECAUSE WHATEVER YOU BELIEVE IN

01:00:25.254 --> 01:00:26.255
IT WILL TAKE COURAGE TO

01:00:26.322 --> 01:00:27.490
IMPLEMENT THAT ON A CONSISTENT

01:00:27.557 --> 01:00:29.158
BASIS.

01:00:29.225 --> 01:00:30.360
YOU I'M PROUD TO STAND A DAY

01:00:30.426 --> 01:00:32.395
BECAUSE I'M PROBABLY ONE OF THE

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:33.830
FEW ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUES.

01:00:33.896 --> 01:00:35.264
WHO ACTUALLY REMEMBER CESA

01:00:35.331 --> 01:00:36.199
CHAVEZ?

01:00:36.265 --> 01:00:37.834
REMEMBER THE GREAT STRIKE AND

01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:39.068
REMEMBER THE MOVEMENT.

01:00:39.135 --> 01:00:41.804
MY ROOMMATE AT THE TIME.

01:00:41.871 --> 01:00:44.507
WAS A YOUNG LATINO FROM BUT SOME

01:00:44.574 --> 01:00:45.475
SAN BERNADINO.

01:00:45.541 --> 01:00:47.110
WHO DID NOT KNOW WHAT SHE WANTED

01:00:47.176 --> 01:00:49.078
TO DO WITH HER LIFE BUT SHE WAS

01:00:49.145 --> 01:00:50.480
PERSISTENT ABOUT GOING TO SCHOOL?

01:00:50.546 --> 01:00:52.115
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I LOOKED UP

01:00:52.181 --> 01:00:54.350
AND IRENE WAS GONE.

01:00:54.417 --> 01:00:56.219
SHE HAD GONE TO THE GRADE STRIKE.

01:00:56.285 --> 01:00:57.220
SHE'D BEEN A STUDENT FOR TWO

01:00:57.286 --> 01:00:58.788
YEARS AT UCLA.

01:00:58.855 --> 01:01:00.356
AND THOUGHT IT WAS EXTREMELY

01:01:00.423 --> 01:01:01.424
IMPORTANT FOR HER TO MAKE A

01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:03.426
DIFFERENCE TO BASICALLY

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:05.128
CHALLENGE WHAT WAS GOING ON AND

01:01:05.194 --> 01:01:06.896
THAT INSPIRED ALL OF US BECAUSE

01:01:06.963 --> 01:01:08.164
WE WERE YOU KNOW COMFORTABLE

01:01:08.231 --> 01:01:09.766
SOMEWHAT COMFORTABLE POOR

01:01:09.832 --> 01:01:11.401
STUDENTS AT UCLA IN THE DORM.

01:01:11.467 --> 01:01:13.136
AND KIND OF A DISTANCE FROM THE

01:01:13.202 --> 01:01:14.404
GREAT STRIKE.

01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:16.205
AND I READ LESS.

01:01:16.272 --> 01:01:18.875
IN THE MIDDLE OF HER JUNIOR YEAR.

01:01:18.941 --> 01:01:20.109
TO GO INTO WORK IN THE GREAT IN

01:01:20.176 --> 01:01:21.778
IN THE FEELS.

01:01:21.844 --> 01:01:23.312
IT CHANGED HER LIFE.

01:01:23.379 --> 01:01:24.514
AND IT REALLY CHANGED HOURS

01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:26.315
BECAUSE WE REALIZE OF IRENE IS

01:01:26.382 --> 01:01:27.817
OUT THERE FIGHTING WE COULD NOT

01:01:27.884 --> 01:01:29.118
BE SITTING HERE IN WESTWOOD

01:01:29.185 --> 01:01:30.486
EATING GRAPES.

01:01:30.553 --> 01:01:31.888
WE HAVE TO FIGHT IN WHATEVER

01:01:31.954 --> 01:01:33.956
CAPACITY WE CAN'T BECAUSE IT WAS

01:01:34.023 --> 01:01:35.625
SO IMPORTANT TO HER.

01:01:35.691 --> 01:01:37.326
THAT SHE WAS THERE THAT SHE WAS

01:01:37.393 --> 01:01:39.595
INVOLVED AND IT INSPIRED HER

01:01:39.662 --> 01:01:40.830
THAT SHE BECAME EVENTUALLY END

01:01:40.897 --> 01:01:42.432
UP CAME BACK TO SCHOOL.

01:01:42.498 --> 01:01:44.367
GOT A DEGREE WENT TO LAW SCHOOL

01:01:44.434 --> 01:01:45.935
AND BECAME EIGHT AN ATTORNEY

01:01:46.002 --> 01:01:47.403
WITH THE LATINO MOVEMENTS THAT

01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:49.605
WITH THEIR IT BECOMES EXTREMELY

01:01:49.672 --> 01:01:50.940
IMPORTANT THAT WE LOOK AT THIS

01:01:51.007 --> 01:01:52.241
BECAUSE THIS WAS NOT.

01:01:52.308 --> 01:01:53.776
A COMFORTABLE TIME FOR PEOPLE TO

01:01:53.843 --> 01:01:54.677
MAKE CHANGE.

01:01:54.744 --> 01:01:56.679
PEOPLE MAY TREMENDOUS SACRIFICES

01:01:56.746 --> 01:01:58.714
IN THE PERSONAL LIVES AND I'M

01:01:58.781 --> 01:01:59.849
SURE THEY WERE PROBABLY GO TO

01:01:59.916 --> 01:02:01.284
SAID THIS WON'T MATTER.

01:02:01.350 --> 01:02:02.819
THIS WON'T COUNT YOU ARE WASTING

01:02:02.885 --> 01:02:04.020
YOUR TIME.

01:02:04.087 --> 01:02:05.455
AND YET SHE FOUND IT IMPORTANT

01:02:05.521 --> 01:02:07.356
AS WELL AS THOUSANDS OF COLLEGE

01:02:07.423 --> 01:02:09.292
STUDENTS TO GET INVOLVED IN TO

01:02:09.358 --> 01:02:10.626
TRY TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE THAT

01:02:10.693 --> 01:02:11.694
WAS THERE.

01:02:11.761 --> 01:02:13.162
I WANT TO CHALLENGE US TODAY AS

01:02:13.229 --> 01:02:14.831
WE THINK ABOUT OUR COMFORTABLE

01:02:14.897 --> 01:02:16.032
SITUATION THAT WE LIVE IN.

01:02:16.099 --> 01:02:17.300
THAT THERE ARE MANY MANY

01:02:17.366 --> 01:02:18.468
INDIVIDUALS WHETHER WE'RE

01:02:18.534 --> 01:02:20.303
TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING

01:02:20.369 --> 01:02:22.004
IN OUR STREETS WHEN WE TALK

01:02:22.071 --> 01:02:23.106
ABOUT VIOLENCE IN OUR STREETS

01:02:23.172 --> 01:02:24.640
WILL EVEN TALKING ABOUT THE

01:02:24.707 --> 01:02:26.509
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POLICE

01:02:26.576 --> 01:02:27.477
OFFICERS IN US.

01:02:27.543 --> 01:02:29.078
AND THE USE OF LETHAL FORCE THE

01:02:29.145 --> 01:02:30.480
QUESTION BECOMES DO WE HAVE THE

01:02:30.546 --> 01:02:32.348
COURAGE TO CHALLENGE THE SYSTEM

01:02:32.415 --> 01:02:34.050
THAT EXISTS. TO FIGHT AGAINST

01:02:34.117 --> 01:02:35.251
THE SYSTEM THAT PEOPLE HAVE

01:02:35.318 --> 01:02:36.986
BECOME VERY COMFORTABLE WITH.

01:02:37.053 --> 01:02:38.254
YET HAS RESULTED IN VERY

01:02:38.321 --> 01:02:40.123
NEGATIVE AND I THINK ABOUT THAT

01:02:40.189 --> 01:02:41.424
ALL THE TIME EVERY TIME WHEN

01:02:41.491 --> 01:02:42.258
WE'RE ON THIS FLOOR WE ARE

01:02:42.325 --> 01:02:44.393
MAKING IMPORTANT DECISIONS ABOUT

01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:46.562
OUR LIVES AND WE CELEBRATE THE

01:02:46.629 --> 01:02:48.598
PAST WE'VE CONSTANTLY CELEBRATE

01:02:48.664 --> 01:02:49.532
THE PAST.

01:02:49.599 --> 01:02:51.968
WITHOUT REALIZING THAT EVERY DAY

01:02:52.034 --> 01:02:54.237
WE ARE RIDING THE PAST.

01:02:54.303 --> 01:02:55.371
WE'RE WRITING HISTORY FOR THE

01:02:55.438 --> 01:02:56.706
DAY THAT WILL BE THE PAST FOR

01:02:56.772 --> 01:02:58.040
TOMORROW AND THE QUESTION

01:02:58.107 --> 01:02:59.742
BECOMES TO ALL OF US WHAT WILL

01:02:59.809 --> 01:03:01.344
OUR CHILDREN SAY ABOUT US WHEN

01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:02.278
WE ARE GONE.

01:03:02.345 --> 01:03:03.646
WELL THEY TALK ABOUT THE

01:03:03.713 --> 01:03:04.780
CHALLENGES WE FACE AND THE

01:03:04.847 --> 01:03:06.549
COURAGE WE HAVE TO FACE THOSE

01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:08.718
CHALLENGES DESPITE WHAT WE SAW

01:03:08.784 --> 01:03:09.652
EACH AND EVERY DAY.

01:03:09.719 --> 01:03:11.187
OR WILL THEY SIMPLY SAY THAT OUR

01:03:11.254 --> 01:03:12.955
FAMILIES OUR PEOPLE WERE

01:03:13.022 --> 01:03:14.056
COMPLICIT.

01:03:14.123 --> 01:03:15.324
THAT WE WERE SILENT ON CRITICAL

01:03:15.391 --> 01:03:17.693
ISSUES AND REFUSE TO STAND UP

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.362
WHEN WE COULD TO SIMPLY MAKE A

01:03:19.428 --> 01:03:25.535
DIFFERENCE I REMEMBER I READ

01:03:25.601 --> 01:03:26.169
EVERY DAY WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE

01:03:26.235 --> 01:03:26.936
GREATEST.

01:03:27.003 --> 01:03:27.603
I REMEMBER WHAT SHE DID THAT WAS

01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:28.271
SO IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE THOUGHT

01:03:28.337 --> 01:03:29.338
WOULD RUIN HER LIFE.

01:03:29.405 --> 01:03:30.473
AND YET IT ENHANCED HER LIFE IT

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:32.074
MADE HER THE KIND OF ATTORNEY

01:03:32.141 --> 01:03:33.509
THAT SHE BECAME AND THE

01:03:33.576 --> 01:03:35.845
COURAGEOUS WOMAN THAT STOOD UP

01:03:35.912 --> 01:03:37.246
FOR THOSE WHO COULD NOT STAND

01:03:37.313 --> 01:03:37.914
FOR THEMSELVES.

01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:40.016
AND IT CHANGED HER CAREER HER

01:03:40.082 --> 01:03:41.784
PROFESSION AND HER TRAJECTORY I

01:03:41.851 --> 01:03:43.286
THINK THAT IS SO EXTREMELY

01:03:43.352 --> 01:03:45.188
IMPORTANT AS REMEMBER CESA

01:03:45.254 --> 01:03:46.989
CHAVEZ THAT YES HE MADE A

01:03:47.056 --> 01:03:48.324
DIFFERENCE IN THIS IN THE

01:03:48.391 --> 01:03:49.525
CALIFORNIA IN THE NATION.

01:03:49.592 --> 01:03:51.127
BUT HE ALSO MADE A DIFFERENCE IN

01:03:51.194 --> 01:03:52.662
OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES WHO TODAY

01:03:52.728 --> 01:03:54.597
CONTINUE TO CARRY FORWARD THE

01:03:54.664 --> 01:03:55.731
MESSAGE THAT HE HAS ABOUT

01:03:55.798 --> 01:03:57.667
JUSTICE AND EQUALITY AND HOW

01:03:57.733 --> 01:03:59.268
IMPORTANT IT IS FOR US TO STAND

01:03:59.335 --> 01:04:00.770
UP FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T STAND FOR

01:04:00.836 --> 01:04:01.571
THEMSELVES.

01:04:01.637 --> 01:04:03.172
AND TO BE UNAFRAID AND

01:04:03.239 --> 01:04:04.240
COURAGEOUS AS WE TALK ABOUT

01:04:04.307 --> 01:04:06.142
CHANGE SO IT IS OUR

01:04:06.209 --> 01:04:07.743
