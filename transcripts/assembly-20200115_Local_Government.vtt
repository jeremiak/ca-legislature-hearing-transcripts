00:35:55.119 --> 00:35:56.087
MILLION SO WERE AND THAT'S JUST

00:35:56.153 --> 00:35:57.555
WHAT WE HAVE PLANNED THIS I

MEAN WE'RE ACTUALLY. BUILDING

00:35:58.422 --> 00:36:00.591
ALL OF THOSE AS YOU KNOW. SO WE

00:36:00.658 --> 00:36:03.094

MIDDLE HOUSING WHICH IS ONE OF

00:38:03.481 --> 00:38:06.417

HAVE TO GO TO VOTE OF THE

00:39:08.779 --> 00:39:11.682
PEOPLE. SO ASKING CITIES AND

00:39:11.749 --> 00:39:12.883
GIVING THEM ONLY THREE MONTHS

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:14.685
TO POTENTIALLY REVISED A

00:39:14.752 --> 00:39:16.887
PUBLICALLY VETTED PLAN TO

00:39:18.222 --> 00:39:21.859
INTO EFFECT IN JANUARY FIRST

00:39:21.926 --> 00:39:22.960
TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IS AN

00:39:23.027 --> 00:39:25.763
UNREASONABLE BURDEN I THINK ON

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:28.299
MANY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WHO

00:39:28.365 --> 00:39:29.300
MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE WANT TO

00:39:29.366 --> 00:39:31.402
EMBRACE THE CPO. AND SO ONE OF

00:39:31.469 --> 00:39:32.236
THE THINGS I THINK YOU SHOULD

00:39:32.303 --> 00:39:33.204
CONSIDER IS CHANGING THE

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:35.005
EFFECTIVE DATE SO IT DOESN'T

00:39:35.072 --> 00:39:36.373
AFFECT THE NEW RENO CYCLE THAT

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:39.710
IS. I'M SURE IT'S APRIL TWENTY

00:39:39.777 --> 00:39:40.878
TWENTY ONE WHEN THOSE HAVE TO

00:39:40.945 --> 00:39:43.047
BE SUBMITTED- BECAUSE IT IS

00:39:43.114 --> 00:39:44.548
ONLY MORE TIME THEY'RE DOING

00:39:44.615 --> 00:39:45.716
WE'RE DOING OUT WHICH ALREADY

00:39:45.783 --> 00:39:46.817
FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE

00:39:46.884 --> 00:39:48.953
CYCE. AND ALL OF MY CITIES IN

00:39:49.019 --> 00:39:51.155
MY JURISDICTION AND SO ADDING

00:39:51.222 --> 00:39:53.157
THIS AFTER THE FACT WILL BE

00:39:53.224 --> 00:39:55.693
WILL BE A VERY UNDUE BURDEN AND

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.294
SO IF THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK

00:39:57.361 --> 00:39:58.863
YOU SHOULD CONSIDER CORRECTING

00:39:58.929 --> 00:39:59.630
BEFORE IT WOULD COME TO A FLOOR

00:39:59.697 --> 00:40:00.965
VOTE TICKETS OUT OF COMMITTEE

00:40:01.031 --> 00:40:04.635
TODAY- COULD YOU DEFINE WHAT

00:40:04.702 --> 00:40:06.237
METROPOLITAN JURISDICTION MEANS

00:40:06.303 --> 00:40:07.104
I KNOW WHERE THE IMMENSELY

00:40:07.171 --> 00:40:07.872
TOOK. THIS IS TAKE OUT THE

00:40:07.938 --> 00:40:09.540
BERMAN JURISDICTIONS BUT MY

00:40:09.607 --> 00:40:11.742
UNDERSTANDING FROM HOSPITALS

00:40:11.809 --> 00:40:13.244
USING CENSUS TRACT DOESN'T

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:15.479
ACTUALLY EXCLUDE WHAT WE WOULD

00:40:15.546 --> 00:40:16.680
CONSIDER NECESSARILY BERMAN

00:40:16.747 --> 00:40:19.884
COULD YOU SPECIFY WHERE EXACTLY

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:20.918
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THIS

00:40:20.985 --> 00:40:23.354
WOULD APPLY. SURE METROPOLITAN

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:24.655
CITIES OUR POPULATIONS OF

00:40:24.722 --> 00:40:27.258
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND- INCLUDE

00:40:27.324 --> 00:40:30.060
ING ALAMEDA COUNTIES ALAMEDA

00:40:30.127 --> 00:40:32.029
CONTRA COSTA ELDORADO LOS

00:40:32.096 --> 00:40:33.798
ANGELES BRAND. OF ORANGE COUNTY

00:40:33.864 --> 00:40:37.935
PLASTER THE RIVERSIDE.

00:40:38.002 --> 00:40:38.569
SACRAMENTO SAMBAR DID INTEND TO

00:40:38.636 --> 00:40:39.103
GO SAN FRANCISCO CEMETERY

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:42.206
YELLOW. SO IT'S METROPOLITAN

00:40:42.273 --> 00:40:42.706
AREAS ARE CONSIDERED BY

00:40:42.773 --> 00:40:45.576
COUNTIES. THAT'S CORRECT. OKAY

00:40:45.643 --> 00:40:46.510
SO I DON'T THINK WE'RE REALLY

00:40:46.577 --> 00:40:47.611
GETTING AT THE CORE OF WHAT

00:40:47.678 --> 00:40:48.746
MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER

00:40:48.813 --> 00:40:49.847
METROPOLITAN I THINK THERE'S

00:40:49.914 --> 00:40:51.916
SOME AREAS THAT WANT TO BE VERY

00:40:51.982 --> 00:40:53.417
URBAN AND SOME AREAS THAT WANT

00:40:53.484 --> 00:40:55.586
TO BE SUBURBAN AND I THINK THIS

00:40:55.653 --> 00:40:58.022
BILL WOULD UNDULY OVERTAKE

00:40:58.088 --> 00:40:59.523
LOCAL CONTROL AND I WANT TO

00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:01.959
POINT OUT AND IN MY CITY AND MY

00:41:02.026 --> 00:41:02.860
CITY ANTHONY THIS IS A VERY

00:41:02.927 --> 00:41:05.930
DIFFICULT HOUSING CITY- AND I

00:41:05.996 --> 00:41:06.897
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE

00:41:06.964 --> 00:41:10.067
THAT ARE SPECIFIC PLANS. IN OUR

00:41:10.134 --> 00:41:12.336
ELEVEN TO OUR EIGHTEEN THERE

00:41:12.403 --> 00:41:12.970
ARE SOME PLACES WHERE WE

00:41:13.037 --> 00:41:15.172
ALLOWED DUPLEXES BY RIGHT SEC

00:41:15.239 --> 00:41:17.107
EVEN IN DIFFICULT PLEASE THERE

00:41:17.174 --> 00:41:18.342
ARE PLACES THAT ARE ZONING FOR

00:41:18.409 --> 00:41:21.078
DUPLEXES ALREADY AND SO I WOULD

00:41:21.145 --> 00:41:22.980
WONDER WHAT IS YOUR LOGIC WHY

00:41:23.047 --> 00:41:24.381

POWER. TO DO THIS ALREADY.

00:41:29.987 --> 00:41:31.455
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT MANY CITIES

ARE NOT IF MY CITIES DOING IT

00:41:33.524 --> 00:41:34.091
LOTS OF CITIES CAN DO IT I HAVE

THROUGH THE EXISTING PROCESS.

00:41:51.308 --> 00:41:52.743
THIS BILL DOESN'T CHANGE ANY OF

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:55.312
THAT- WHAT IT DOES CHANGE IS IT

00:41:55.379 --> 00:41:57.715
ESTABLISHES A- VERY MODEST

00:42:05.055 --> 00:42:07.024
VERY LOW. ON THE VET LOW IN

00:42:07.091 --> 00:42:08.659
VERY LOW ALLOCATIONS THAT THEY

CITIES AROUND THE STATE ARE

00:42:20.971 --> 00:42:23.140
NOT. MEETING THEIR RINA TARGETS

00:42:23.207 --> 00:42:24.475
IN MANY OF THESE PLACES

00:42:24.541 --> 00:42:25.876
ESPECIALLY ACTUALLY IN THE MOD

00:42:25.943 --> 00:42:26.410
CATEGORY IN THE MODERATE

00:42:26.477 --> 00:42:29.546
CATEGORY- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:42:29.613 --> 00:42:30.347
HAVE TO UPDATE THEIR SITES

THEM SO WHAT BUT WHAT I'M

00:42:34.118 --> 00:42:35.619
SEEING IS THERE'S NO

00:42:35.686 --> 00:42:37.588
JURISDICTION IN MY DISTRICT.

00:42:37.655 --> 00:42:40.557
THAT ACTUALLY HAS INSUFFICIENT.

00:42:40.624 --> 00:42:43.093
ABOVE MODERATE CATEGORIES. ALL

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:44.461
OF THEM ARE SUFFICIENTLY

00:42:44.528 --> 00:42:47.131
PLANNING FOR THEIR MODERATE

00:42:47.197 --> 00:42:47.998
CATEGORIES AND I THINK IT'S

00:42:48.065 --> 00:42:49.300
REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE IN

00:42:49.366 --> 00:42:51.302
SACRAMENTO. SIT HERE REMEMBER

00:42:51.368 --> 00:42:52.970
THAT CITIES ARE THAT THE

00:42:53.037 --> 00:42:54.405
CONTRACT THAT WE IS THE STATE

00:42:54.471 --> 00:42:55.406
OF CALIFORNIA HAVE WITH OUR

00:42:55.472 --> 00:42:57.675
CITIES. IS THAT THEY PLAN FOR

00:42:57.741 --> 00:42:59.476
IT THEY'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:42:59.543 --> 00:43:01.178
BUILDING IT SO WHEN WE LOOK AT

00:43:01.245 --> 00:43:02.079
WHAT'S BEING BUILT AND WHAT'S

00:43:02.146 --> 00:43:04.748
BEING. PLANNED FOR THE CITY IS

00:43:04.815 --> 00:43:09.119
A RESPONSIBLE FOR PLANNING. AND

00:43:09.186 --> 00:43:09.753
SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS I THINK

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:13.157
THERE'S A REALLY. THE BIGGEST

00:43:13.223 --> 00:43:14.224
ISSUE I THINK ISN'T WORKING.

00:43:14.291 --> 00:43:14.792
AND IT FROM SACRAMENTO OF

00:43:14.858 --> 00:43:15.225
SOMETHING THAT LOCAL

00:43:15.292 --> 00:43:15.826
GOVERNMENTS CAN ALREADY DO BY

00:43:15.893 --> 00:43:17.795
THEMSELVES. THAT THEY'RE IN

00:43:17.861 --> 00:43:19.797
CONVERSATIONS WITH EACH CD

00:43:19.863 --> 00:43:21.565
ABOUT ENSURING THAT THEY HAVE

00:43:21.632 --> 00:43:23.701
SUFFICIENT MODERATE AND ABOVE

00:43:23.767 --> 00:43:24.802
MODERATE SITES. ALL CITIES IN

00:43:24.868 --> 00:43:27.037
MY JURISDICTION DO. AND WE

00:43:27.104 --> 00:43:29.406
DON'T HAVE A GAP THERE. AND IT

00:43:29.473 --> 00:43:31.875
IS A CITY HAS A GAP IN PLANNING

00:43:31.942 --> 00:43:33.410
FOR MODERATE AND A- MODERATE

00:43:33.477 --> 00:43:35.179
ABOVE MOTOR. THEIR HOUSING

00:43:35.245 --> 00:43:38.082
ELEMENT I'M SORRY. THERE

00:43:38.148 --> 00:43:38.649
HOUSING ELEMENT WILL NOT BE

00:43:38.716 --> 00:43:42.052
APPROVED. SO I THINK IF ONE

00:43:42.119 --> 00:43:43.620
WERE TO INCENTIVIZE THIS THAT'S

00:43:43.687 --> 00:43:46.190
FINE IF THE HOUSING IS THAT HE

00:43:46.256 --> 00:43:46.790
DIDN'T PLAN FOR THIS THAT'S

00:43:46.857 --> 00:43:49.093
FINE. BUT IT SHOULD BE ALREADY

00:43:49.159 --> 00:43:50.194
REQUIRES THAT THEY'RE

00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:51.362
SUFFICIENT MODERATE AND ABOVE

00:43:51.428 --> 00:43:53.163
MODERATE AND HOW IS CITY DOES

00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:54.898
THAT ARE JURISDICTION DOES THAT

00:43:54.965 --> 00:43:57.501
IS UP TO THEM. IT'S NOT UP TO

00:43:57.568 --> 00:43:58.068
US TO TELL THEM THEY HAVE TO

00:43:58.135 --> 00:44:01.939
GET RID OF OUR ONE ZONING. I

00:44:02.006 --> 00:44:03.040
THINK I THINK I THINK THIS BILL

00:44:03.107 --> 00:44:04.742
WOULDN'T WOULDN'T DO THAT I

00:44:04.808 --> 00:44:06.210
WOULD JUST REQUIRE THAT FOR

00:44:06.276 --> 00:44:07.878
THAT SITE THAT THEY IDENTIFIED

00:44:07.945 --> 00:44:09.213
TO MEET THEIR MODERN ABOVE MY

00:44:09.279 --> 00:44:11.115
NEEDS. 25% OF THOSE WOULD HAVE

00:44:11.181 --> 00:44:12.916
TO ALLOW AT LEAST DUPLEXES SO

00:44:12.983 --> 00:44:14.351
IN. THE CASE THAT YU'RE

00:44:14.418 --> 00:44:15.986
BRINGING UP IT'S POSSIBLE THAT

00:44:16.053 --> 00:44:16.954
ANTHONY THIS IS ALREADY

00:44:17.021 --> 00:44:18.889
COMPLYING WITH THAT. THAT MIGHT

00:44:18.956 --> 00:44:20.424
BE THE ONLY CASE FOR INSIDIOUS

00:44:20.491 --> 00:44:23.394
MAY COMPLY WITH NOT- IS
