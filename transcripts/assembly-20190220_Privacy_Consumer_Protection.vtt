00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:28.413
FORTUNE OF WORKING CLOSELY WITH

SEVENTY FIVE TO FIND A SOLUTION

00:27:34.519 --> 00:27:35.954

GREAT CONCERN FOR QUITE SOME

00:27:37.622 --> 00:27:39.491
TIME.

I EAT DATA PRIVACY.

00:27:40.658 --> 00:27:42.560
A BIG PART OF THE REASON WE WERE

00:27:42.627 --> 00:27:44.362
ABLE TO REACH DOT.

00:27:44.429 --> 00:27:46.464
LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION WAS BECAUSE

00:27:46.531 --> 00:27:48.333
OF THE EFFORTS OF A MISTER

AND THE WHO HAD A PRIVACY

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:53.638
INITIATIVE FOR SINCE

00:27:53.705 --> 00:27:55.440
CONSIDERATION ON A TWENTY

00:27:55.507 --> 00:27:57.776
EIGHTEEN BALLOT.

00:27:57.842 --> 00:27:59.911
ON THE SAME SUBJECT MATTER.

00:27:59.978 --> 00:28:01.079
AND TOGETHER WITH THE THE

00:28:01.146 --> 00:28:02.147
VALUABLE INPUT OF MANY OTHER

00:28:02.213 --> 00:28:03.715
STAKEHOLDERS WE WERE ABLE TO

00:28:03.782 --> 00:28:05.316
ENACT THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER

00:28:05.383 --> 00:28:06.518
PRIVACY ACT.

00:28:06.584 --> 00:28:07.886
A WHICH HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS

00:28:07.952 --> 00:28:09.888
THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE PRIVACY

00:28:09.954 --> 00:28:11.890
RIGHTS LAW IN THE NATION.

00:28:11.956 --> 00:28:13.992
I FELT DAN AND I STILL FEEL NOW

00:28:14.059 --> 00:28:16.628
THAT AT ITS CORE THE CCPA IS

00:28:16.694 --> 00:28:18.630
PREMISED ON A RELATIVELY SIMPLE

00:28:18.696 --> 00:28:19.464
CONCEPT.

00:28:19.531 --> 00:28:21.466
IT IS BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE

00:28:21.533 --> 00:28:22.867
THAT PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE THE

00:28:22.934 --> 00:28:25.070
RIGHT TO CONTROL OF THEIR OWN

00:28:25.136 --> 00:28:26.538
PERSONAL DATA.

00:28:26.604 --> 00:28:28.440
AND SHOULD NOT BE DISCRIMINATED

00:28:28.506 --> 00:28:30.141
AGAINST FOR EXERCISING THAT

00:28:30.208 --> 00:28:31.709
RIGHT.

00:28:31.776 --> 00:28:32.744
IF THE BUSINESS ONCE COLLECT

00:28:32.811 --> 00:28:34.579
INFORMATION ABOUT YOU WHILE

00:28:34.646 --> 00:28:36.014
SERVING ALL THE WAY UP.

00:28:36.081 --> 00:28:37.649
AND THEN USE IT FOR REASONS OF

00:28:37.715 --> 00:28:38.483
THEY'RE ALL.

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:41.453
LIKE PROVIDING A SERVICE OR SELL

00:28:41.519 --> 00:28:44.556
SHOULD ASK YOUR PERMISSION FIRST.

00:28:44.622 --> 00:28:46.291
BECAUSE IT IS YOUR DATA YOUR

00:28:46.357 --> 00:28:49.060
PRIVACY IT'S YOUR CHOICE.

00:28:49.127 --> 00:28:50.929
SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THE PC CPA

00:28:50.995 --> 00:28:52.997
ON JUNE TWENTY EIGHT WE HAVE

00:28:53.064 --> 00:28:54.866
TURNED TO CLEAN UP AND

00:28:54.933 --> 00:28:57.168
ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS.

00:28:57.235 --> 00:28:58.503
WITH THE HELP OF THE SPEAKER THE

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:00.105
ASSEMBLY WAS ABLE TO OBTAIN AN

00:29:00.171 --> 00:29:02.140
ADDITIONAL SEVEN HUNDRED

00:29:02.207 --> 00:29:02.974
THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR ENFORCEMENT

00:29:03.041 --> 00:29:03.875
EFFORTS.

00:29:03.942 --> 00:29:05.910
BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.

00:29:05.977 --> 00:29:07.612
OF COURSE RECOGNIZING THAT

00:29:07.679 --> 00:29:09.380
ADDITIONAL FUNDING WILL BE

00:29:09.447 --> 00:29:11.116
NEEDED INTO THE FUTURE I AM

00:29:11.182 --> 00:29:13.351
COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK

00:29:13.418 --> 00:29:15.787
ON THIS ISSUE THROUGH LEADERSHIP.

00:29:15.854 --> 00:29:17.088
WITH MY COLLEAGUES IN BOTH

00:29:17.155 --> 00:29:18.189
HOUSES.

00:29:18.256 --> 00:29:20.258
AND SEPARATELY BY THE END OF

00:29:20.325 --> 00:29:20.892
TWENTY EIGHTEEN WITH THE PASSAGE

00:29:20.959 --> 00:29:23.061
OF SB.

00:29:23.128 --> 00:29:23.895
ELEVEN TWENTY ONE WE WERE ABLE

00:29:23.962 --> 00:29:25.763
TO DRESS DRAFTING ERRORS AND

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:27.398
BRING CLARITY TO THE LAW WITH

00:29:27.465 --> 00:29:28.733
RESPECT TO THE FINANCIAL

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:29.734
INDUSTRY.

00:29:29.801 --> 00:29:32.470
NEWSPAPERS AND VARIOUS CONCERNS

00:29:32.537 --> 00:29:34.038
RAISED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.

00:29:34.105 --> 00:29:36.040
THAT BEING SAID BASED ON

00:29:36.107 --> 00:29:38.209
CONVERSATION OF OUR TEAM HAS HAD

00:29:38.276 --> 00:29:39.944
WITH BOTH BUSINESS AND PRIVACY

00:29:40.011 --> 00:29:41.246
GROUPS.

00:29:41.312 --> 00:29:43.014
A SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THE LAW

00:29:43.081 --> 00:29:44.849
IT IS CLEAR TO ME THAT OUR WORK

00:29:44.916 --> 00:29:46.384
IS NOT DONE YET.

00:29:46.451 --> 00:29:47.452
THIS HEARING TODAY IS IN

00:29:47.519 --> 00:29:50.188
RECOGNITION OF THAT VERY FACT.

00:29:50.255 --> 00:29:51.422
I KNOW FIRST BEFORE WE DO

00:29:51.489 --> 00:29:52.690
ANYTHING ELSE IT IS CRITICAL

00:29:52.757 --> 00:29:53.892
THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT

00:29:53.958 --> 00:29:55.393
CALIFORNIANS.

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:57.996
BUSINESSES LEGISLATIVE STAFF IN

00:29:58.062 --> 00:29:59.364
INCOMING LEGISLATORS HAVE A

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:00.832
STRONG UNDERSTANDING OF THE

00:30:00.899 --> 00:30:02.500
RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS THAT WE

00:30:02.567 --> 00:30:05.336
WANT FOR CALIFORNIANS LAST YEAR.

00:30:05.403 --> 00:30:07.572
AS WELL AS THE OBLIGATIONS THAT

00:30:07.639 --> 00:30:09.874
IS C. C. P. A. IMPOSES FOR

00:30:09.941 --> 00:30:11.075
BUSINESSES.

00:30:11.142 --> 00:30:12.744
ONCE WE HAVE DONE THAT IS IT IS

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:14.546
JUST AS CRITICAL THAT WE

00:30:14.612 --> 00:30:16.915
CONTINUE OUR WORK TO ENSURE THAT

00:30:16.981 --> 00:30:19.150
THE LAW IS RE FINE TRUE TO OUR

00:30:19.217 --> 00:30:20.218
INTENT.

00:30:20.285 --> 00:30:21.886
SO THAT THE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS

00:30:21.953 --> 00:30:24.722
WE FOUGHT AVAILABLE FOR

00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:26.624
CONSUMERS AND ALSO THAT

00:30:26.691 --> 00:30:29.194
BUSINESSES ARE ABLE TO CARRY OUT

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:31.062
THE LAW AND PRACTICE.

00:30:31.129 --> 00:30:32.997
IT IS EASY TO FALL INTO THE TRAP

00:30:33.064 --> 00:30:34.365
OF TALKING ABOUT THESE ISSUES --

00:30:34.432 --> 00:30:35.934
WOOD BUSINESS AND TECH ON ONE

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.869
SIDE AND CONSUMER AND PRIVACY

00:30:37.936 --> 00:30:39.470
GROUPS ON THE OTHER BUT I HOPE

00:30:39.537 --> 00:30:41.906
WE CAN AVOID THE TYPES OF THESE

00:30:41.973 --> 00:30:43.174
TYPES OF PRE JUDGMENTS.

00:30:43.241 --> 00:30:44.943
ALL WHILE I'M SURE WE CAN FIND

00:30:45.009 --> 00:30:47.011
AREAS OF DISAGREEMENT ON WHAT

00:30:47.078 --> 00:30:48.379
NEEDS TO BE DONE.

00:30:48.446 --> 00:30:49.747
I'M VERY CONFIDENT THAT THERE IS

00:30:49.814 --> 00:30:51.816
PLENTY OF COMMON GROUND TO STAND

00:30:51.883 --> 00:30:53.718
ON AND HOLD FOR CONSENSUS

00:30:53.785 --> 00:30:56.487
BUILDING INTO THE NEAR FUTURE.

00:30:56.554 --> 00:30:57.488
MY GOAL FOR THIS HEARING IS TO

00:30:57.555 --> 00:30:59.324
DELVE INTO SOME OF THE ISSUES

00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:01.626
THAT MY OFFICE AND LIKELY MANY

00:31:01.693 --> 00:31:03.394
OF OUR YOUR OFFICES HAVE BEEN

00:31:03.461 --> 00:31:05.830
HEARING ABOUT OVER THE LAST FEW

00:31:05.897 --> 00:31:07.465
MONTHS.

00:31:07.532 --> 00:31:09.300
AND TO UNCOVER COMMON GROUNDS

00:31:09.367 --> 00:31:09.867
FOR ADDITIONAL WORK THAT MAY

00:31:09.934 --> 00:31:11.135
EXIST.

00:31:11.202 --> 00:31:12.637
AND WERE THE NEXT BIG POLICY

00:31:12.704 --> 00:31:14.872
QUESTIONS AND CHALLENGES --

00:31:14.939 --> 00:31:16.207
MIGHT LIE.

00:31:16.274 --> 00:31:18.142
THIS IS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE --

00:31:18.209 --> 00:31:19.244
TO THIS COMMITTEE BECAUSE I

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:21.579
ANTICIPATE WE WILL BE SEEING A

00:31:21.646 --> 00:31:23.047
BIT MORE CCPA.

00:31:23.114 --> 00:31:24.949
CLEAN UP ALL LEGISLATION THIS

00:31:25.016 --> 00:31:26.084
YEAR.

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:26.884
AS CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE I

00:31:26.951 --> 00:31:29.120
WANT TO MAKE IT KNOWN AS EARLY

00:31:29.187 --> 00:31:30.655
AS POSSIBLE THAT I EXPECT TO

00:31:30.722 --> 00:31:33.191
AUTHORS AND STAKEHOLDERS TO WORK

00:31:33.258 --> 00:31:35.393
COLLECTIVELY AND BILL AS MUCH

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:37.195
CONSENSUS AS POSSIBLE.

00:31:37.262 --> 00:31:38.896
ON ANY OF THE ISSUES THAT BRING

00:31:38.963 --> 00:31:40.331
THAT THEY BRING BEFORE THE

00:31:40.398 --> 00:31:41.299
COMMITTEE.

00:31:41.366 --> 00:31:42.834
IN OBVIOUSLY IT'S MY HOPE THAT

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:45.203
FOLKS WILL.

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:46.704
ALL THE IMPORTANT RIGHTS THAT WE

00:31:46.771 --> 00:31:47.772
HAVE ESTABLISHED FOR

00:31:47.839 --> 00:31:50.108
CALIFORNIANS IN THE NAME OF

00:31:50.174 --> 00:31:51.542
CLEAN UP WILL CLARITY.

00:31:51.609 --> 00:31:52.710
WE MUST SAFEGUARD THOSE RIGHTS

00:31:52.777 --> 00:31:54.245
AND I WILL LOOK TO MEMBERS OF

00:31:54.312 --> 00:31:55.747
THIS COMMITTEE TO JOIN ME IN

00:31:55.813 --> 00:31:57.081
THAT ARE.

00:31:57.148 --> 00:31:58.483
FOR I BELIEVE THAT IF WE WORK

00:31:58.549 --> 00:32:00.118
TOGETHER AND WORKED DILIGENTLY.

00:32:00.184 --> 00:32:02.020
MORE OFTEN THAN NOT THERE WILL

00:32:02.086 --> 00:32:03.821
BE WORKABLE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE

00:32:03.888 --> 00:32:06.157
SURGICAL SIZE AND DO NOT ROLL

00:32:06.224 --> 00:32:08.793
BACK TO RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:11.596
THAT'S DALGLISH BY CCPA.

00:32:11.663 --> 00:32:12.764
AND I'M ALSO HOPEFUL THAT THE

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:14.932
CONVERSATIONS TODAY CAN SERVE AS

00:32:14.999 --> 00:32:16.100
A STEP IN THOSE.

00:32:16.167 --> 00:32:18.503
EFFORTS TO FIND COMMONALITY FOR

00:32:18.569 --> 00:32:20.104
FUTURE WORK AND TO IDENTIFY

00:32:20.171 --> 00:32:22.807
ISSUES THAT DO NOT YET WARRANT

00:32:22.874 --> 00:32:24.008
LEGISLATION.

00:32:24.075 --> 00:32:25.343
WITHOUT I LOOK FOR TO OUR

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:26.711
DISCUSSION HERE TODAY.

00:32:26.778 --> 00:32:28.379
AND TURNED OUT TO MY FELLOW

00:32:28.446 --> 00:32:30.315
MEMBERS FOR ANY OPENING REMARKS

00:32:30.381 --> 00:32:31.983
THAT THEY LIKE TO MAKE AT THIS

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:34.585
POINT THANK YOU.

00:32:34.652 --> 00:32:41.326
MR OBERNOLTE GO AHEAD PLEASE.

00:32:41.392 --> 00:32:42.327
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M VERY

00:32:42.393 --> 00:32:44.095
PROUD THAT THE EFFORT TO PASS A

00:32:44.162 --> 00:32:45.530
CCPA LAST YEAR WAS BOTH A

00:32:45.596 --> 00:32:46.964
BICAMERAL EFFORT ANY BI PARTISAN

00:32:47.031 --> 00:32:47.365
EFFORT.

00:32:47.432 --> 00:32:49.600
WE WERE FORCED TO DO SO ON A

00:32:49.667 --> 00:32:51.336
VERY ABBREVIATED TIME FRAME AND

00:32:51.402 --> 00:32:53.338
THEREFORE WE KNEW THAT THE

00:32:53.404 --> 00:32:54.939
LEGISLATION WAS GONNA REQUIRE A

00:32:55.006 --> 00:32:55.606
SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF CLEAN UP

00:32:55.673 --> 00:32:57.108
AND SO THAT'S WHAT THIS EFFORT

00:32:57.175 --> 00:32:57.942
IS GOING TO BE FOCUSED ON THIS

00:32:58.009 --> 00:32:59.477
YEAR -- BUT

00:32:59.544 --> 00:33:01.112
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING

00:33:01.179 --> 00:33:01.746
THROUGH THE ISSUES I THINK IT'S

00:33:01.813 --> 00:33:03.681
GOING TO BE NOT A MONTHS LONG

00:33:03.748 --> 00:33:05.383
EFFORT BUT A YEARS LONG EFFORT --

SOME OF SAID LOOK I WAS JUST

00:36:51.042 --> 00:36:52.476
BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE WAS

LEGISLATORS ARE SMART AND

00:36:57.648 --> 00:36:59.350

00:37:03.821 --> 00:37:05.957
SIDE OF HISTORY ON THIS VOTE --

00:37:06.023 --> 00:37:06.524

00:37:06.591 --> 00:37:07.725
ACTUALLY DID.

00:37:07.792 --> 00:37:08.893
I I ONE OF THREE MAIN THINGS FOR

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:10.027
IT TO DO THE FIRST WAS I WANT TO

00:37:10.094 --> 00:37:11.529
FIND OUT WHAT COMPANIES KNEW

00:37:11.596 --> 00:37:12.997

THAT -- THAT

00:37:14.565 --> 00:37:16.200
INFORMATION SO WE CALL THAT THE

00:37:16.267 --> 00:37:17.401
RIGHT TO KNOW.

00:37:17.468 --> 00:37:19.370
THE SECOND IS.

00:37:19.437 --> 00:37:20.471
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO TELL NOT TO

00:37:20.538 --> 00:37:21.639

AROUND THE WORLD WHICH HAPPENS

00:37:23.841 --> 00:37:25.676
RIGHT NOW AND SO.

00:37:25.743 --> 00:37:27.745
THIS IS THE RIGHT TO SAY NO.

00:37:27.812 --> 00:37:28.746
AND THEN THE THIRD IS LOOKING

IDENTITY THEFT AND SO THAT WAS

00:37:34.385 --> 00:37:35.486
THE RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR

00:37:35.553 --> 00:37:37.755

00:40:20.584 --> 00:40:22.987
BUT WE DO HAVE A PRIVATE RIGHT

00:40:23.053 --> 00:40:25.222
OF ACTION IS CONSUMER FORSMAN

00:40:25.289 --> 00:40:26.357
FOR NEGLIGENT DATA REGION THIS

00:40:26.423 --> 00:40:28.025
IS IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT FOR

00:40:28.092 --> 00:40:30.327
FOR A SECOND BECAUSE BY RIGHT

00:40:30.394 --> 00:40:31.362
ACTIONS GOT A LOT OF PRESS.

00:40:31.428 --> 00:40:32.463
AND YET I DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE A

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:33.931
SITUATION WHERE THE COMPANY'S

00:40:33.998 --> 00:40:35.299
DOING ITS BEST.

00:40:35.366 --> 00:40:36.967
AND THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT HACKS

00:40:37.034 --> 00:40:38.235
INTO IT AND THEN THE COMPANY HAS

00:40:38.302 --> 00:40:39.270
IT HAS A HUGE ISSUE.

00:40:39.336 --> 00:40:41.572

REASONABLE SECURITY PROCEDURES

00:40:51.949 --> 00:40:53.217
AND PRACTICES IN PLACE DON'T

00:40:53.284 --> 00:40:54.919

00:41:03.994 --> 00:41:05.830
ANALOGY OF A BANK THAT.

00:41:05.896 --> 00:41:07.097
NOT ONLY DOESN'T WALK IT OR

00:41:07.164 --> 00:41:08.732
DOESN'T SHUT THE DOOR THOSE

00:41:08.799 --> 00:41:09.533
COMPANIES WERE TRYING TO SAY HEY

IMPORTANT.

00:41:15.573 --> 00:41:18.275
SO WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE US NOW.

00:41:18.342 --> 00:41:19.176

00:41:19.243 --> 00:41:20.911
STARK CIRCLE CONTACT WHERE WE

00:41:20.978 --> 00:41:22.346

00:41:22.413 --> 00:41:23.013
THINK ABOUT THE NINETEEN FIFTIES

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:24.381
WITH AUTO SAFETY.

00:41:24.448 --> 00:41:25.783
THINK WHAT THE NINETEEN SIXTIES

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:26.884
WITH --

00:41:26.951 --> 00:41:28.552

00:41:28.619 --> 00:41:29.119
RIGHTS FOR THE ANTI SMOKING

00:41:29.186 --> 00:41:30.421
PROGRAMS.

00:41:30.487 --> 00:41:31.622
THINK ABOUT THE NINETEEN

00:41:31.689 --> 00:41:33.390
SEVENTIES WITH AUTO EMISSIONS.

00:41:33.457 --> 00:41:34.658
IN EACH CASE SOCIETY

00:41:34.725 --> 00:41:34.959
[inaudible]

00:41:35.025 --> 00:41:36.327
AND GOVERNMENT.

00:41:36.393 --> 00:41:37.361
REALIZE THERE WAS A PROBLEM AND

00:41:37.428 --> 00:41:38.662
DEMANDED CHANGE AND SET THE

00:41:38.729 --> 00:41:39.763
INDUSTRY LOOK YOU CAN DO BETTER

00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:41.699
YOU MUST DO BETTER.

00:41:41.765 --> 00:41:43.667
IN MANY CASES INDUSTRY.

00:41:43.734 --> 00:41:46.270
VEHEMENTLY RESISTED AT INITIALLY.

00:41:46.337 --> 00:41:48.272
AND YET IMAGINE TODAY A WORLD

00:41:48.339 --> 00:41:49.006
WHERE.

00:41:49.073 --> 00:41:51.008
WE DIDN'T HAVE THESE.

00:41:51.075 --> 00:41:53.344
CHANGES HAD BEEN HADN'T HADN'T

ON ANY DAY FRANKLY.

00:41:56.046 --> 00:41:57.982
AND SO I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE

00:41:58.048 --> 00:41:58.582
ARE RIGHT NOW A LOT IT'S BEEN

00:41:58.649 --> 00:42:00.417

IT PROTECTS PERSONAL DATA WHICH

00:44:17.821 --> 00:44:19.390
IS WHAT THEY CALL PI.

00:44:19.456 --> 00:44:21.692
AND IT DEFINES THAT AS DATED

00:44:21.759 --> 00:44:23.127
THAT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY

00:44:23.193 --> 00:44:26.130
IDENTIFIES A NATURAL PERSON.

00:44:26.196 --> 00:44:27.598
THIS PROTECTS STATED THAT

00:44:27.664 --> 00:44:30.100
IDENTIFIES PEOPLE WHILE AVOIDING

00:44:30.167 --> 00:44:32.136
OVER CAPTURING DATA THAT ARE

00:44:32.202 --> 00:44:33.137
MERELY KEEP WILL BEING

00:44:33.203 --> 00:44:35.239
ASSOCIATED WITH THEM FOR EXAMPLE

00:44:35.305 --> 00:44:37.174
THE GENDER FEMALE IS CAPABLE OF

00:44:37.241 --> 00:44:39.343
BEING ASSOCIATED WITH HALF THE

00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:41.678
HUMAN POPULATION.

00:44:41.745 --> 00:44:42.279
BUT IT DOESN'T IDENTIFY ANY OF

00:44:42.346 --> 00:44:44.048
US.

00:44:44.114 --> 00:44:47.017
IT ALSO EXCLUDES TO DONNA MISER

00:44:47.084 --> 00:44:47.985
DE IDENTIFIED DATA.

00:44:48.052 --> 00:44:49.887
BECAUSE IT RECOGNIZES THAT THIS

00:44:49.953 --> 00:44:51.855
TYPE OF DATA DOES NOT BUT IT BY

00:44:51.922 --> 00:44:54.825
ITSELF IDENTIFY PEOPLE. TO TO PR

00:44:54.892 --> 00:44:56.960
IS A DEFINITION ALLOWS THE RULES

00:44:57.027 --> 00:44:58.662
THAT FLOW FROM IT. TO PROTECT

00:44:58.729 --> 00:45:01.632
PRIVACY AND THE SECURITY OF DATA.

00:45:01.698 --> 00:45:03.033
THAT IDENTIFY A PERSON.

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:04.334
REGARDLESS OF THE TECHNOLOGY

00:45:04.401 --> 00:45:06.170
INVOLVED.

00:45:06.236 --> 00:45:07.671
IT ALSO FOSTERS INNOVATION AND

00:45:07.738 --> 00:45:09.306
ECONOMIC GROWTH.

00:45:09.373 --> 00:45:11.141
IN YET IT AVOIDS TRAMPLING ON

00:45:11.208 --> 00:45:13.243
THE PRIVACY OF OTHERS WHOSE DATA

00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:15.979
MAY BE COMMINGLED IN THE SAME

00:45:16.046 --> 00:45:18.048
HOUSEHOLD OR DEVICE.

00:45:18.115 --> 00:45:21.051
WOW SEE CBA'S INTENDED TO MIRROR

00:45:21.118 --> 00:45:22.586
TEACH YOU TO DO G. DEPART P. R.

00:45:22.653 --> 00:45:23.387
PRINCIPLES IT COULD BE

00:45:23.454 --> 00:45:24.888
MISINTERPRETED TO APPLY TO A

00:45:24.955 --> 00:45:26.790
BROADER SET OF DATA THAN YOU

00:45:26.857 --> 00:45:28.625
INTENDED. TO AVOID THESE

00:45:28.692 --> 00:45:30.794
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IT COULD

00:45:30.861 --> 00:45:32.162
BE HELPFUL FOR YOU TO HELP

00:45:32.229 --> 00:45:34.231
FURTHER HARMONIZE C. C. P. A.'S

00:45:34.298 --> 00:45:37.701
DEFINITION OF PI. TO THE GDP OUR

00:45:37.768 --> 00:45:39.503
DEFINITION OF PERSONAL DATA.

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:42.840
SECOND GPR HAS RULES FOR WHEN PI

00:45:42.906 --> 00:45:44.475
CAN BE USED.

00:45:44.541 --> 00:45:46.777
LIKE CCPA IT STRIKES A BALANCE

00:45:46.844 --> 00:45:48.745
BETWEEN PROTECTING PRIVACY AND

00:45:48.812 --> 00:45:50.781
GIVING PEOPLE CONTROL OVER THEIR

00:45:50.848 --> 00:45:52.850
PI WHILE PERMITTING IT TO BE

00:45:52.916 --> 00:45:54.852
USED AND SHARED FOR LEGITIMATE

00:45:54.918 --> 00:45:57.855
BUSINESS PURPOSES.

00:45:57.921 --> 00:45:58.822
GPR REQUIRES CONSENT WHERE IT

00:45:58.889 --> 00:46:00.657
MATTERS MOST FOR EXAMPLE WHEN

00:46:00.724 --> 00:46:01.758
THERE IS A SURPRISING OR

00:46:01.825 --> 00:46:03.994
UNEXPECTED OR NOT REASONABLY

00:46:04.061 --> 00:46:06.096
ANTICIPATED SALE OF YOUR DATA.

00:46:06.163 --> 00:46:08.232
JUDY PR DOES NOT HOWEVER REQUIRE

00:46:08.298 --> 00:46:09.900
CONSENT WHEN A BUSINESS AND ITS

00:46:09.967 --> 00:46:11.468
SERVICE PROVIDERS USE DATA

00:46:11.535 --> 00:46:14.338
TRANSPARENTLY FAIRLY AND BASED

00:46:14.404 --> 00:46:17.207
ON OTHER LAWFUL REASONS SUCH AS

00:46:17.274 --> 00:46:17.841
FOR EXAMPLE TO COMPLY WITH THE

00:46:17.908 --> 00:46:18.709
LAW.

00:46:18.775 --> 00:46:20.144
ANTI MONEY LAUNDERING BEING A

00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:22.246
GOOD EXAMPLE OF IT. TO FILL A

00:46:22.312 --> 00:46:24.915
CONTRACT WITH OR TO PROVIDE THIS

00:46:24.982 --> 00:46:27.351
IS REQUESTED BY THE CONSUMER.

00:46:27.417 --> 00:46:28.886
AND IT IN WAYS THAT ARE

00:46:28.952 --> 00:46:30.454
OTHERWISE IN A LEGITIMATE

00:46:30.521 --> 00:46:31.388
INTEREST OF THE BUSINESS FOR

00:46:31.455 --> 00:46:33.090
EXAMPLE TO RUN A LOYALTY OR

REWARDS PROGRAM TO BENEFIT THEIR

00:46:35.659 --> 00:46:38.195

00:46:38.262 --> 00:46:39.363
YOU TO PEER ARE YOU.

00:46:39.429 --> 00:46:40.731
CURTAILS PROBLEMATIC DATA SALES

00:46:40.797 --> 00:46:42.799

BUSINESS PURPOSES.

00:46:48.739 --> 00:46:50.774
WE COMMEND YOU FOR STRIKING A

00:46:50.841 --> 00:46:52.276
SIMILARLY THOUGHTFUL BALANCING

00:46:52.342 --> 00:46:54.478
CCPA.

00:46:54.545 --> 00:46:55.946
THIRD.

00:46:56.013 --> 00:46:58.315
GPR GIVES EUROPEAN DATA RIGHTS.

00:46:58.382 --> 00:47:00.250
AS ALISTAIR MENTIONED UPON A

00:47:00.317 --> 00:47:02.219
VERIFIABLE REQUEST.

00:47:02.286 --> 00:47:03.921
EUROPEANS HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW

00:47:03.987 --> 00:47:05.989
AN AXIS WITH DATA COMPANY HAS ON

00:47:06.056 --> 00:47:07.824
THEM HOW IT'S USED AND WHY IN

00:47:07.891 --> 00:47:09.793
THE CATEGORIES OF THIRD PARTIES

00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:10.694
WITH WHOM IT SHARED.

00:47:10.761 --> 00:47:11.762
IT ALSO GIVES THEM THE RIGHT TO

00:47:11.828 --> 00:47:14.865
CORRECT INTO PORT TO TAKE THAT

00:47:14.932 --> 00:47:16.500
DATA WITH THEM.

00:47:16.567 --> 00:47:17.367
IT GIVES THEM THE RIGHT TO

00:47:17.434 --> 00:47:20.137
DELETE DATA WHICH JUST LIKE IN

00:47:20.204 --> 00:47:23.040
CCPA IS NOT ABSOLUTE.

00:47:23.106 --> 00:47:24.841
IT IS SUBJECT TO EXEMPTIONS

00:47:24.908 --> 00:47:27.244
CALIBRATED TO PERMIT LEGITIMATE

00:47:27.311 --> 00:47:29.346
DATA USES TO CONTINUE.

00:47:29.413 --> 00:47:30.414
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT EXEMPTION

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:32.983
[inaudible] FOR EXAMPLE.

00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:35.285
IT PREVENTS THINGS LIKE A FRAUD

00:47:35.352 --> 00:47:38.088
STIRS STANDING IN A DAY DELETE

00:47:38.155 --> 00:47:39.556
ME REQUEST.

00:47:39.623 --> 00:47:40.490
THAT IS INTENDED TO WEAKEN THE

00:47:40.557 --> 00:47:41.558
COMPANY'S ABILITY TO DETECT

00:47:41.625 --> 00:47:43.727
THEIR FRAUDULENT DEEDS.

00:47:43.794 --> 00:47:48.332
NOW THIS IS IMPORTANT --

00:47:48.398 --> 00:47:49.866
IN ITS BEST TO THE LAST POINT IS

00:47:49.933 --> 00:47:52.035
A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BETWEEN

00:47:52.102 --> 00:47:53.971
GPRC CBA BEST ILLUSTRATED BY AN

00:47:54.037 --> 00:47:55.005
EXAMPLE.

00:47:55.072 --> 00:47:58.275
SO CONTRARY TO MY BET BEST --

00:47:58.342 --> 00:47:59.643
IT TOOK TO MY PRIVACY BACKGROUND

00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:01.111
I HAVE.

00:48:01.178 --> 00:48:02.512
YOU KNOW SUBMITTED MY DNA EIGHT

00:48:02.579 --> 00:48:05.582
IF LEARN MORE ABOUT MY ANCESTRY.

00:48:05.649 --> 00:48:07.117
THE THOUGHT THAT SOMEBODY COULD

00:48:07.184 --> 00:48:09.086
TAKE DATA THAT WAS STOLEN FROM

00:48:09.152 --> 00:48:10.220
ME DURING THE EQUIFAX HACK.

00:48:10.287 --> 00:48:12.456
INTO DARK NET.

00:48:12.522 --> 00:48:14.992
USE THAT DATA TO CALL THE ONE

00:48:15.058 --> 00:48:16.693
EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER TO PRETEND

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:18.795
TO BE ME AND GET A COPY OF MY

00:48:18.862 --> 00:48:19.630
GENETIC CODE.

00:48:19.696 --> 00:48:22.399
TERRIFIES ME.

00:48:22.466 --> 00:48:25.235
G. DPR MITIGATES AGAINST AT RISK.

00:48:25.302 --> 00:48:28.171
BY NOT DICTATING THE MEANS FOR

00:48:28.238 --> 00:48:29.706
ALLOWING SOMEBODY TO EXERCISE

00:48:29.773 --> 00:48:31.008
THEIR RIGHTS.

00:48:31.074 --> 00:48:32.676
BUT SIMPLY IT LEAVES IT UP TO

00:48:32.743 --> 00:48:35.212
THE BUSINESS TO DETERMINE HOW TO

00:48:35.279 --> 00:48:36.079
DO THAT.

00:48:36.146 --> 00:48:38.448
IN THE CONTEXT OF HOW THEY

00:48:38.515 --> 00:48:39.816
USUALLY INTERACT WITH THE

00:48:39.883 --> 00:48:42.419
CUSTOMER WHAT THAT DOES.

00:48:42.486 --> 00:48:43.920
IS ALLOW BUSINESSES TO TAKE A

00:48:43.987 --> 00:48:46.623
RISK BASED APPROACH TO MAKE SURE.

00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:47.524
THAT THEY KIND OF KNOW THE

00:48:47.591 --> 00:48:49.559
PERSON WHO'S ACTUALLY TRYING TO

00:48:49.626 --> 00:48:53.630
GET A COPY OF THE DATA IS YOU.

THEY CALL THEM DATA SUBJECTS

00:50:55.118 --> 00:50:56.520

00:55:23.486 --> 00:55:25.288
THING FOR US TO DO --

00:55:25.355 --> 00:55:27.323

AND AND I WOULD POINT OUT AS AS

00:55:31.428 --> 00:55:33.096
MISTER MCTAGGART POINTED BROUGHT

00:55:33.163 --> 00:55:33.730
UP THIS IS THIS WASN'T SOMETHING

00:55:33.797 --> 00:55:36.800
THAT -- YOU

00:55:36.866 --> 00:55:37.600
KNOW TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE

00:55:37.667 --> 00:55:38.768
PROCESS OF PAY IN ADDITION TO

00:55:38.835 --> 00:55:40.537
BEING ON THE BALLOT WELL WE'VE

00:55:40.603 --> 00:55:41.171
SEEN THAT HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES

00:55:41.237 --> 00:55:42.372
NOW.

00:55:42.439 --> 00:55:44.274
AND IF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THAT

00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:46.176
PROCESS BEING USED IN WE SHOULD

00:55:46.242 --> 00:55:47.610
DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.

00:55:47.677 --> 00:55:48.912
YOU KNOW THAT ALL THE SLEEVE

00:55:48.978 --> 00:55:50.814
THAT THEIR HOWEVER THERE WAS A

00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:52.348
LOT OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS

00:55:52.415 --> 00:55:54.150
BILL THAT YOU WERE INVOLVED WITH

00:55:54.217 --> 00:55:55.418
MISTER CHAIRMAN --

00:55:55.485 --> 00:55:56.953
THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS WAS ALSO

00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:59.122
BUT WE HAD BRIEFINGS.

00:55:59.189 --> 00:56:01.124
ON THIS LEGISLATION --

00:56:01.191 --> 00:56:02.592
IN AS AS MISTER MCTAGGART SAID

00:56:02.659 --> 00:56:04.494
TWO AND A HALF YEARS OF RESEARCH

00:56:04.561 --> 00:56:05.829
THAT WENT INTO --

00:56:05.895 --> 00:56:08.131
THE YOU KNOW THE THE LEGISLATION

00:56:08.198 --> 00:56:10.767
ITSELF AND DRAFTING --

00:56:10.834 --> 00:56:12.602
YOU KNOW I I DO SEE THAT THERE

00:56:12.669 --> 00:56:13.937
MAY BE ISSUES WHERE WE NEED TO

00:56:14.003 --> 00:56:16.806
CLARIFY YOU KNOW FOR BUSINESS

00:56:16.873 --> 00:56:17.440
AND SO THAT PEOPLE KNOW HOW TO

00:56:17.507 --> 00:56:18.308
BE.

00:56:18.374 --> 00:56:20.043
COMPLIANT WITH THE LAW BUT I

00:56:20.110 --> 00:56:21.444
THINK WE NEED TO BE VERY MUCH ON

00:56:21.511 --> 00:56:23.747
GUARD AGAINST IS MAYBE THINGS

00:56:23.813 --> 00:56:25.081
THAT AVAIL DOES THAT.

00:56:25.148 --> 00:56:26.182
BUT ARE REALLY SEEKING TO TRY

00:56:26.249 --> 00:56:27.751
AND UNDERMINE THE SUBSTANTIVE

00:56:27.817 --> 00:56:28.718
RIGHTS.

00:56:28.785 --> 00:56:32.122
GRANTED BY THE CCPA.

00:56:32.188 --> 00:56:33.656
AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING I WANT

00:56:33.723 --> 00:56:36.092
TO BE WATCHING VERY CLOSELY --

00:56:36.159 --> 00:56:38.995
I THINK THE I JUST FIND IT A

00:56:39.062 --> 00:56:41.264
LITTLE BIT OF A STRETCH TO START

00:56:41.331 --> 00:56:42.532
TALKING ABOUT THAT THE REAL

00:56:42.599 --> 00:56:44.167
CONCERN IS ABOUT FRAUDSTERS

00:56:44.234 --> 00:56:46.636
CALLING IN AND TRYING TO GET.

00:56:46.703 --> 00:56:47.971
YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WHEN A

00:56:48.037 --> 00:56:49.672
LOT OF THESE BUSINESSES HAVE SO

00:56:49.739 --> 00:56:51.708
MUCH INFORMATION HAVE THINGS IN

00:56:51.775 --> 00:56:53.543
PLACE THAT THEY KNOW MORE.

00:56:53.610 --> 00:56:56.045
YEAH ABOUT THESE INDIVIDUALS --

00:56:56.112 --> 00:56:58.381
THEN MOST PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO

00:56:58.448 --> 00:56:59.849
THINK THEY DO --

00:56:59.916 --> 00:57:01.551
AND HAVE GUARDS AND CHECKED

00:57:01.618 --> 00:57:03.620
ENSURE THAT THE PERSON IS.

00:57:03.686 --> 00:57:04.654
WHO THEY'RE SAYING THEY ARE WHAT

00:57:04.721 --> 00:57:05.989
PEOPLE ARE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT

00:57:06.055 --> 00:57:08.291
WITH FOR EXAMPLE TWENTY THREE IN

00:57:08.358 --> 00:57:10.660
ME AND SENDING IN YOUR DNA?

00:57:10.727 --> 00:57:12.295
IS THAT FOR EXAMPLE A

00:57:12.362 --> 00:57:13.763
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY COMES IN

00:57:13.830 --> 00:57:15.365
AND BUYS A LOT OF SHARES IN THE

00:57:15.431 --> 00:57:16.733
IN THE COMPANY.

00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:18.134
AND THE CONCERN IS OKAY IS THAT

00:57:18.201 --> 00:57:20.937
DATA NOW AND FIND OUT ABOUT MY

00:57:21.004 --> 00:57:22.872
ANCESTRY BUT NAY FOR SOMETHING

00:57:22.939 --> 00:57:24.440
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT --

00:57:24.507 --> 00:57:25.875
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE

00:57:25.942 --> 00:57:27.777
PERMISSION THAT I GAVE WHEN I

00:57:27.844 --> 00:57:29.946
WHEN I VOLUNTARILY GAVE --

00:57:30.013 --> 00:57:32.916
THAT DATA AND SO TO ME LIKE WHAT

00:57:32.982 --> 00:57:33.583
WHAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO GET

00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:35.251
AT STE CERTAINLY WE WANT TO

PEOPLE ABUSING THE SYSTEM --

00:57:39.455 --> 00:57:41.090
FOR SURE BUT I THINK THE BIGGER

00:57:41.157 --> 00:57:42.258
CONCERN AND THREAT OUT THERE

00:57:42.325 --> 00:57:43.560
FROM THE PUBLIC IS THAT THEIR

00:57:43.626 --> 00:57:45.495
DATA IS BEING USED IN WAYS THAT

00:57:45.562 --> 00:57:47.297
THEY NEVER GAVE PERMISSION. TO

00:57:47.363 --> 00:57:49.499
USE AND IS BEING MONETIZE IN

00:57:49.566 --> 00:57:50.967
WAYS THAT THEY NEVER GAVE.

00:57:51.034 --> 00:57:52.635
PERMISSION --

00:57:52.702 --> 00:57:54.270

00:57:54.337 --> 00:57:55.972

ONE YOU GET THREE CONSENT FIFTY

01:01:25.314 --> 01:01:26.516
KEEPING HIM THE POP UPS YOU KNOW

01:01:26.582 --> 01:01:28.551
WE DON'T KNOW HOW BUT NOW --

01:01:28.618 --> 01:01:29.786
SECONDLY IT THERE'S A CHILLING

01:01:29.852 --> 01:01:30.420
EFFECT POTENTIALLY ON INNOVATION

01:01:30.486 --> 01:01:32.255
IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT

01:01:32.321 --> 01:01:32.889

ALSO BECAUSE WE PROVIDE THAT

01:01:47.036 --> 01:01:48.704
THIRD PARTY OPT OUT WE THINK

01:01:48.771 --> 01:01:49.405
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IS MOST

01:01:49.472 --> 01:01:51.007
PEOPLE JUST GONNA SET IT IN

01:01:51.074 --> 01:01:52.442

AND WE'LL GIVE YOU SOME RIGHT SO

01:01:58.648 --> 01:02:02.752
THE WHEN WOMEN OFTEN THOUGH

IT DOES BY PROTECTIONS ONE OF

01:02:11.094 --> 01:02:12.595
THE PROBLEMS AGAIN IS IS --

01:02:12.662 --> 01:02:13.830
YOU KNOW WE LIVE IN A DIFFERENT

01:02:13.896 --> 01:02:15.465

THE PEOPLE YOU TRUST THE MOST

01:02:28.711 --> 01:02:32.215
AND THAT THIS APPROACH SEEMED.

01:02:32.281 --> 01:02:33.616
FROM THE PEOPLE I TALK TO HAVE

01:02:33.683 --> 01:02:34.383
BEEN SAYING THIS FOR THEIR

01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:34.951
LIFETIME SO WE DON'T THEIR

01:02:35.017 --> 01:02:35.551
WORKING LIKE TIME SEEMS TO BE

01:02:35.618 --> 01:02:36.919
THE BEST APPROACH FOR THIS

01:02:36.986 --> 01:02:38.321
COUNTRY GIVEN THE FRAMEWORK WE

01:02:38.387 --> 01:02:39.489

01:02:47.363 --> 01:02:47.630
IMPORTANT --

01:02:47.697 --> 01:02:49.298
DISCUSSION TODAY BECAUSE AS I'VE

01:02:49.365 --> 01:02:51.100
SAID BEFORE I YOU KNOW IT IT

01:02:51.167 --> 01:02:52.001
CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO LEAD THE

01:02:52.068 --> 01:02:53.803
NATION ON THIS BUT WE ALSO MAKE

01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:55.538
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE.

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:57.140
AND UP WITH MODEL LEGISLATION

01:02:57.206 --> 01:02:59.008
THAT THE THE REST OF THE COUNTRY

01:02:59.075 --> 01:03:02.345
CAN FOLLOW AND AND OF THEIR AT

01:03:02.411 --> 01:03:04.413
WHEN I WAS AT THE NATIONAL

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:05.882
LEAGUE OF CITIES --

01:03:05.948 --> 01:03:07.016
A NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF STATE

LEGISLATURES OR WAS A BIG

01:03:08.317 --> 01:03:09.886
DISCUSSION AS YOU AND I HAVE

01:03:09.952 --> 01:03:11.420
TALKED ABOUT ABOUT A FEDERAL

01:03:11.487 --> 01:03:13.589
PREEMPTION AND AND I THAT'S WHY

01:03:13.656 --> 01:03:15.858
I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT.

01:03:15.925 --> 01:03:17.894
THAT GETS IT RIGHT AND MAKE SURE

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:21.364
THAT WE PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF

01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:22.965
OF OUR RESIDENTS.

01:03:23.032 --> 01:03:25.401
AND AT THE SAME TIME DON'T BRING

01:03:25.468 --> 01:03:29.071
EVERYTHING TO A GRINDING HALT SO --

01:03:29.138 --> 01:03:31.707
I HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND

01:03:31.774 --> 01:03:33.142
AND YOU KNOW AND I THINK SOME OF

01:03:33.209 --> 01:03:34.477
IT IS JUST GOING TO REQUIRE

01:03:34.544 --> 01:03:36.345
CLARIFICATION ALONG THE WAY AND

01:03:36.412 --> 01:03:38.548
ONE OF THE THINGS WAS --

01:03:38.614 --> 01:03:40.750
THE SLIDE THAT CAME UP EARLY ON

01:03:40.816 --> 01:03:42.585
ABOUT THE THREE SAFE HARBORS AND

01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:43.719
THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSION

01:03:43.786 --> 01:03:44.453
ABOUT.

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:46.589
DOES IT HAVE TO BE ALL THREE OF

01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:49.725
THEM OR IS IT EITHER ENCRYPTION

01:03:49.792 --> 01:03:52.228
REDACTION OR REASONABLE SECURITY

01:03:52.295 --> 01:03:53.362
AND THEN --

01:03:53.429 --> 01:03:55.865
MAYBE YOU CAN DESCRIBE TO ME HOW

01:03:55.932 --> 01:03:58.367
WE DETERMINE WHAT REASONABLE

01:03:58.434 --> 01:04:02.505
SECURITY AS THANK YOU.

01:04:02.572 --> 01:04:04.774
SO IT'S IT'S IT'S ANY OF THEM --

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:07.510
IT'S NOT ALL INTENDED TO BE ALL --

01:04:07.577 --> 01:04:09.478
THREE AND SO THE EXISTING

01:04:09.545 --> 01:04:11.480
CALIFORNIA LAW FROM --

01:04:11.547 --> 01:04:13.149
WELL BEFORE TCPA REQUIRED

01:04:13.216 --> 01:04:13.716
COMPANIES TO COLLECT YOUR

01:04:13.783 --> 01:04:14.617
PERSONAL INFORMATION TO HAVE THE

01:04:14.684 --> 01:04:15.985
REASONABLE PRACTICES AND

01:04:16.052 --> 01:04:17.019
PROCEDURES IN PLACE TO PROTECT

01:04:17.086 --> 01:04:19.355
THE AT THE NAY THE INFORMATION --

01:04:19.422 --> 01:04:19.755
IT.

01:04:19.822 --> 01:04:22.024
AND SO WE REFERENCE THAT THAT'S

01:04:22.091 --> 01:04:27.296
THE AT THE PARK THE PROBLEM

01:04:27.363 --> 01:04:28.364
PREVIOUSLY WAS THERE WERE NO

01:04:28.431 --> 01:04:29.665
TEETH AND THERE WERE CERTAIN NO

01:04:29.732 --> 01:04:32.068
CONSEQUENCES --

01:04:32.134 --> 01:04:34.537
YOU KNOW I THINK CANDIDLY THAT

01:04:34.604 --> 01:04:36.439
COMPANIES WILL WANT CERTAINTY SO

01:04:36.505 --> 01:04:37.640
FIGHT CRYPT LEAST AT THE

01:04:37.707 --> 01:04:39.075
THRESHOLD OF DONE.

01:04:39.141 --> 01:04:40.376
AND BASICALLY THINK ABOUT A

01:04:40.443 --> 01:04:41.010
CHRISTIAN THIS IS OFF THE SHELF

01:04:41.077 --> 01:04:41.911
TECHNOLOGY WE'RE NOT TALKING

01:04:41.978 --> 01:04:43.679
ABOUT YOU KNOW --

01:04:43.746 --> 01:04:44.480
LETTING SOMEONE ON THE MOVE

01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:45.448
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT JUST YOU CAN

01:04:45.514 --> 01:04:46.882
BE ANYBODY CAN AND SHOULD

01:04:46.949 --> 01:04:48.317
ESPECIALLY BIG COMPANIES SHE CAN

01:04:48.384 --> 01:04:49.252
AND SHOULD BE ENCRYPTING THE

01:04:49.318 --> 01:04:50.486
DATA.

01:04:50.553 --> 01:04:52.154
SO THAT IT IS A VERY CHEAP WILL

01:04:52.221 --> 01:04:53.956
MEASURE FOR REJECT THE DATA

01:04:54.023 --> 01:04:56.125
TAKING THE PEOPLE'S NAMES OUT OF

01:04:56.192 --> 01:04:57.159
THE CONSUMERS NAMES AT THE DATA

01:04:57.226 --> 01:04:58.728
SAID -- BUT

01:04:58.794 --> 01:04:59.562
ALSO --

01:04:59.629 --> 01:05:01.097
THERE'S A THIRD OPTION BECAUSE

01:05:01.163 --> 01:05:01.897
WE WANT TO REFERENCE EXISTING

01:05:01.964 --> 01:05:03.966
CALIFORNIA LAW BUT ANY OF THOSE --

01:05:04.033 --> 01:05:05.735
THREE WILL BE OKAY THANK YOU AND

01:05:05.801 --> 01:05:07.036
I BY CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOUR

01:05:07.103 --> 01:05:08.638
OPENNESS AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN

01:05:08.704 --> 01:05:10.172
CONTINUE.

01:05:10.239 --> 01:05:11.374
TO WORK TOGETHER AND THEN I HAVE

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:19.749
ONE OTHER QUESTION AND IS IT --

01:05:19.815 --> 01:05:24.754
THIS. FORTY FOUR FOUR YOU TALKED

01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:25.421
ABOUT --

01:05:25.488 --> 01:05:28.024
INITIALLY 85% OF THE COMPANY'S

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:29.258
WEREN'T READY FOR A G. P. R..

01:05:29.325 --> 01:05:31.093
AND NOW IT'S 25% I'D ACTUALLY

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:33.929
HEARD STATISTICS THAT WERE THAT --

01:05:33.996 --> 01:05:36.132
THAT WE ONLY HAVE 40% THAT ARE

01:05:36.198 --> 01:05:39.969
ACTUALLY OUR GDP ARE COMPLIANT

01:05:40.036 --> 01:05:44.073
SO -- IS

01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:45.274
THAT IN THE UNITED STATES.

01:05:45.341 --> 01:05:47.143
SO THAT FIGURE CAME WAS SUPPOSED

01:05:47.209 --> 01:05:47.777
TO COVER BOTH THAT YOU AND THE

01:05:47.843 --> 01:05:50.079
US IT WAS FROM I THINK I SAID

01:05:50.146 --> 01:05:51.280
CSO MAGAZINE IS WHERE THAT

01:05:51.347 --> 01:05:51.981
STATISTIC CAME FROM I MEAN TO BE

01:05:52.048 --> 01:05:52.648
PERFECTLY HONEST WITH YOU IN MY

01:05:52.715 --> 01:05:53.582
EXPERIENCE.

01:05:53.649 --> 01:05:54.950
AS A PRACTITIONER.

01:05:55.017 --> 01:05:56.052
I SEE ALMOST NO COMPANIES THAT

01:05:56.118 --> 01:05:57.987
ARE WHAT YOU WOULD CALL FULLY

01:05:58.054 --> 01:05:59.121
COMPLIANT I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK

01:05:59.188 --> 01:06:00.289
THERE'S REALLY SUCH A THING. TO

01:06:00.356 --> 01:06:02.658
BE HONEST AS FULLY COMPLIANT AND

01:06:02.725 --> 01:06:04.627
I DON'T LIKE IT FOR EXAMPLE WHEN

01:06:04.694 --> 01:06:06.729
I SEE --

01:06:06.796 --> 01:06:09.165
VENDORS THAT SELL SERVICES

01:06:09.231 --> 01:06:10.866
VENDORS ARE TECHNOLOGY VENDORS

01:06:10.933 --> 01:06:12.568
THAT COME OUT AND SAY OH WILL

01:06:12.635 --> 01:06:15.338
HELP MAKE YOU 1100% GPR

01:06:15.404 --> 01:06:16.939
COMPLIANT JUST LIKE I DON'T LIKE

01:06:17.006 --> 01:06:18.607
THAT WITH ANY OTHER KIND OF SALE

01:06:18.674 --> 01:06:20.276
THAT ALLEGEDLY IS GONNA MAKE YOU

01:06:20.343 --> 01:06:21.744
100% COMPLIANT WITH LAW.

01:06:21.811 --> 01:06:23.379
IT'S A PROCESS IT'S AN ONGOING

01:06:23.446 --> 01:06:25.381
PROCESS IT'S NOT JUST A POINT IN

01:06:25.448 --> 01:06:27.416
TIME WHERE YOU CHECK ALL THESE

01:06:27.483 --> 01:06:28.050
BOXES AND YOU SAY --

01:06:28.117 --> 01:06:29.352
OR DONE THERE ARE SOME STANDARDS

01:06:29.418 --> 01:06:30.619
OUT THERE LIKE THAT LIKE THE

01:06:30.686 --> 01:06:33.055
PAYMENT CARD INDUSTRY STANDARD --

01:06:33.122 --> 01:06:34.757
WHICH IS BEING CRITICIZED QUITE

01:06:34.824 --> 01:06:35.991
A LOT BY THOSE IN THE

01:06:36.058 --> 01:06:37.226
INFORMATION'S KURT SECURITY

01:06:37.293 --> 01:06:38.327
WORLD BECAUSE IT'S A CHECK THE

01:06:38.394 --> 01:06:39.528
BOX APPROACH AND IT DOESN'T

01:06:39.595 --> 01:06:40.796
ACTUALLY EAN ANYTHING.

01:06:40.863 --> 01:06:42.965
YOU CAN CHECK ALL THOSE BOXES

01:06:43.032 --> 01:06:43.566
ONE MINUTE AND THEN THE NEXT

01:06:43.632 --> 01:06:44.133
MINUTE.

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:45.368
MAYBE DON'T HAVE REASONABLE

01:06:45.434 --> 01:06:47.002
SECURITY MORE BECAUSE THE BAD

01:06:47.069 --> 01:06:48.804
GUYS ARE IN AGAIN RIGHT.

01:06:48.871 --> 01:06:51.107
SIMILARLY WITH JUDY PR --

01:06:51.173 --> 01:06:52.375
LET'S TALK ABOUT LIKE THOSE FAKE

01:06:52.441 --> 01:06:54.410
REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION WHICH

01:06:54.477 --> 01:06:56.178
DO HAPPEN THEY REALLY DO HAPPEN

01:06:56.245 --> 01:06:58.147
THERE'S A GREAT ARTICLE THAT IS

01:06:58.214 --> 01:06:59.548
OUT THERE WITH THE I. P. ABOUT

01:06:59.615 --> 01:07:01.717
FAKE DATA SUBJECT REQUESTS THAT

01:07:01.784 --> 01:07:03.719
YOU CAN FIND ON THEIR BLOG --

01:07:03.786 --> 01:07:04.653
THIS IS ALREADY HAPPENING UNDER

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:08.057
GPR HOW CAN YOU BE COMPLIANCE IF

01:07:08.124 --> 01:07:09.525
WHEN WHEN SOMEBODY COMES TO YOU

01:07:09.592 --> 01:07:11.060
AND ALL YOU HAVE IS THEY GIVE

01:07:11.127 --> 01:07:12.728
YOU THEIR EMAIL ADDRESS AND SAY.

01:07:12.795 --> 01:07:14.463
I WANT ALL THE INFORMATION YOU

01:07:14.530 --> 01:07:15.765
HAVE ABOUT ME AND I. P.

01:07:15.831 --> 01:07:17.400
ADDRESSES AND IN YOU KNOW

01:07:17.466 --> 01:07:18.834
INFORMATION ABOUT WEB BROWSING

01:07:18.901 --> 01:07:19.668
BEHAVIORS SUPPOSED TO BE PART OF

01:07:19.735 --> 01:07:20.736
THAT.

01:07:20.803 --> 01:07:21.737
YOU CAN'T KNOW THAT BASED ON

01:07:21.804 --> 01:07:22.905
JUST WHAT SOMEBODY'S EMAIL IS IN

01:07:22.972 --> 01:07:23.472
THEY COULD BE USING SOMEONE

01:07:23.539 --> 01:07:25.674
ELSE'S EMAIL BUT IF YOU ASK THEM

01:07:25.741 --> 01:07:27.243
TO VERIFY.

01:07:27.309 --> 01:07:27.943
GIVE ME SOME SORT OF

01:07:28.010 --> 01:07:29.111
IDENTIFICATION FIRST OF ALL

01:07:29.178 --> 01:07:30.246
YOU'RE ASKING THEM TO GIVE YOU

01:07:30.312 --> 01:07:31.981
MORE PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT

01:07:32.047 --> 01:07:32.581
YOU DIDN'T WANT IN THE FIRST

01:07:32.648 --> 01:07:34.116
PLACE.

01:07:34.183 --> 01:07:34.583
AND THAT'S NOT PRIVACY

01:07:34.650 --> 01:07:35.618
PROTECTIVE.

01:07:35.684 --> 01:07:38.687
SECONDLY THEY DON'T WANT TO GIVE

01:07:38.754 --> 01:07:41.991
A TEO DO THAT DON'T ASK THEM FOR

01:07:42.057 --> 01:07:44.493
VERIFICATION SO IT IS TRUE WE

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:46.328
ARE SEEN FRAUDULENT FAKE

01:07:46.395 --> 01:07:48.864
REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION HOW CAN

01:07:48.931 --> 01:07:50.032
ANY COMPANY POSSIBLY BE.

01:07:50.099 --> 01:07:51.300
G. P. R. COMPLIANT UNDER THOSE

01:07:51.367 --> 01:07:53.302
CIRCUMSTANCES IT'S AN IMPOSSIBLE

01:07:53.369 --> 01:07:54.937
BURDEN TO CHEAP SO I HAPPEN TO

01:07:55.004 --> 01:07:56.672
BELIEVE THE STATISTICS ARE MUCH

01:07:56.739 --> 01:07:57.373
LOWER.

01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.708
AND THAT MAYBE ONLY THE VERY

01:07:59.775 --> 01:08:02.111
LARGEST COMPANIES WITH THE VERY

01:08:02.178 --> 01:08:03.946
LARGEST BUDGETS FOR THIS KIND OF

01:08:04.013 --> 01:08:05.848
THING HAVE ACHIEVED ANYTHING

01:08:05.915 --> 01:08:11.320
CLOSE TO GPR COMPLIANCE --

01:08:11.387 --> 01:08:12.788
AND I THINK THE RIGHT TO BE

01:08:12.855 --> 01:08:13.756
FORGOTTEN IS SOMETHING THAT'S

01:08:13.823 --> 01:08:15.458
PROBLEM AND WE DON'T HAVE THAT

01:08:15.524 --> 01:08:18.027
IN CCPA BUT THAT SEEMS LIKE A

01:08:18.093 --> 01:08:19.829
FOR MANY COMPANIES IT'S ALMOST

01:08:19.895 --> 01:08:22.331
IMPOSSIBLE --

01:08:22.398 --> 01:08:25.100
TO TO COMPLY WITH --

01:08:25.167 --> 01:08:26.836
AND I SAID I DO NOT THAT'S THE

01:08:26.902 --> 01:08:28.437
QUESTION BEFORE I'M NOT CLEAR ON

01:08:28.504 --> 01:08:29.271
WHAT IS THE ENFORCEMENT.

01:08:29.338 --> 01:08:31.740
MECHANISM IN THE UNITED STATES

01:08:31.807 --> 01:08:34.009
FOR GDP ARE RIGHT SO--

01:08:34.076 --> 01:08:36.145
THE EUROPEAN REGULATORS AND LIKE

01:08:36.212 --> 01:08:37.079
I SAID THERE'S THIS EXTRA

01:08:37.146 --> 01:08:39.148
TERRITORIAL APPLICATION

01:08:39.215 --> 01:08:40.416
PROVISION.

01:08:40.483 --> 01:08:42.818
IN THE GPR THAT ALLOWS THE DATA

01:08:42.885 --> 01:08:44.787
PROTECTION AUTHORITIES IN YOUR

01:08:44.854 --> 01:08:47.323
IN EUROPE TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST

01:08:47.389 --> 01:08:49.091
US COMPANIES.

01:08:49.158 --> 01:08:51.093
OR OR AT LEAST ATTEMPT TO TAKE

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:52.928
ACTION AGAINST US COMPANIES THAT

01:08:52.995 --> 01:08:54.730
ARE EVEN IF THEY DON'T HAVE

01:08:54.797 --> 01:08:56.165
WHAT'S CALLED ESTABLISHMENT IN

01:08:56.232 --> 01:08:58.467
EUROPE SO EVEN IF NO OFFICE.

01:08:58.534 --> 01:09:00.135
EVEN IF NO PERSONNEL THIS IS

01:09:00.202 --> 01:09:02.771
WHAT CHANGED UNDER GPR NOW IF

01:09:02.838 --> 01:09:05.241
I'M HERE IN THE U. S. BUT I AM

01:09:05.307 --> 01:09:08.677
ACTIVELY OFFERING MY SERVICES TO

01:09:08.744 --> 01:09:10.279
PEOPLE IN THE EO.

01:09:10.346 --> 01:09:11.213
THEN.

01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:12.314
THEY GET ME THEY THEY SAY THEY

01:09:12.381 --> 01:09:13.082
CAN PULL ME AND AND THEY CAN

01:09:13.148 --> 01:09:14.316
EXERT THEIR AUTHORITY OVER ME

01:09:14.383 --> 01:09:16.118
NOW ARE WE GONNA SEE U. S.

01:09:16.185 --> 01:09:17.786
COMPANIES FIGHTING THAT FROM A

01:09:17.853 --> 01:09:19.388
JURISDICTIONAL PERSPECTIVE.

01:09:19.455 --> 01:09:23.659
I WOULD IMAGINE SO AT SOME POINT

01:09:23.726 --> 01:09:25.828
ALREADY KNOWS THAT GOOGLE NOW

01:09:25.895 --> 01:09:28.831
GOOGLE IS A UNIQUE EXAMPLE AND

01:09:28.898 --> 01:09:30.266
BECAUSE THEY THEY PROBABLY DO

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:31.100
HAVE EUROPEAN STATUS WHEN THEY

01:09:31.166 --> 01:09:31.967
DO IN FACT HAVE EUROPEAN

01:09:32.034 --> 01:09:33.035
ESTABLISHMENT IT'S A LITTLE

01:09:33.102 --> 01:09:34.937
pBUT THERE'S BEEN A FIFTY MILLION

01:09:35.004 --> 01:09:37.640
DOLLAR FINE FIFTY MILLION EUROS

01:09:37.706 --> 01:09:38.941
WITH EVERYONE CALLED ABOUT THAT

01:09:39.008 --> 01:09:40.342
FINE ASSESSED AGAINST THEM.

01:09:40.409 --> 01:09:41.844
WE'VE SEEN OTHER SITUATIONS

01:09:41.911 --> 01:09:43.913
WHERE YOU REGULATORS HAVE KIND

01:09:43.979 --> 01:09:48.284
OF WAFFLE A LITTLE BIT ON THIS

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:50.219
SO THERE IS A A A LETTER FROM

01:09:50.286 --> 01:09:51.120
THE UK INFORMATION

01:09:51.186 --> 01:09:52.288
COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE TO THE

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:54.323
WASHINGTON POST TAKING ISSUE

01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:55.591
WITH SOMETHING THEY DID AND

01:09:55.658 --> 01:09:56.492
SAYING IT WAS IN VIOLATION OF

01:09:56.559 --> 01:09:57.626
GPR BUT THEN SAYING SOMETHING.

01:09:57.693 --> 01:09:58.694
LIKE WELL WE CAN'T REALLY DO

01:09:58.761 --> 01:10:00.396
ANYTHING ABOUT IT SO I THINK THE

01:10:00.462 --> 01:10:01.830
SHORT ANSWER IS.

01:10:01.897 --> 01:10:02.998
WE REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW THEY

01:10:03.065 --> 01:10:05.601
PLANNED EXERCISE JURISDICTION WE

01:10:05.668 --> 01:10:08.237
JUST KNOW THEY CLAIM THEY CAN.

01:10:08.304 --> 01:10:09.905
OKAY AND THEN --

01:10:09.972 --> 01:10:12.274
I JUST LAST QUESTION.

01:10:12.341 --> 01:10:14.443
FOR MS BRO --

01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:18.881

SOME OF THE DIFFICULTIES WITH CC?

01:10:26.121 --> 01:10:28.591
PA AS OPPOSED TO GDP ARE ARGUES

01:10:28.657 --> 01:10:32.061
IS SQUARE [inaudible]

01:10:32.127 --> 01:10:34.830
SOMEWHAT COMPLIANCE.

01:10:34.897 --> 01:10:37.366
SO YEAH HAPPIER DRESS THAT --

01:10:37.433 --> 01:10:38.500
SO WE NOT ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS

01:10:38.567 --> 01:10:39.301

NOT JUST FOR SQUARE.

01:10:44.273 --> 01:10:46.108
BUT EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO ALLOW

01:10:46.175 --> 01:10:48.077
THE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT WE

01:10:48.143 --> 01:10:50.179
SERVE IN EUROPE TO ALSO COMPLY

01:10:50.245 --> 01:10:51.380
WITH THE LAW.

01:10:51.447 --> 01:10:53.315
OUT WE HAVE A PRODUCT IN PLACE

01:10:53.382 --> 01:10:55.184
WHERE FOR EXAMPLE THEY CAN TAKE

01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:57.252
IN THE DATA RIGHT ACROSS FROM

01:10:57.319 --> 01:10:58.420
THEIR OWN CUSTOMERS AND THEIR

01:10:58.487 --> 01:11:00.556
OWN EMPLOYEES --

01:11:00.623 --> 01:11:04.927
AND WE HERE --

01:11:04.994 --> 01:11:07.262
BUT TO ADDRESS ALSO MISTER

01:11:07.329 --> 01:11:08.430
GALLAGHER IS CONCERNED BECAUSE I

01:11:08.497 --> 01:11:09.531
JUST WANNA MAKE THIS VERY VERY

01:11:09.598 --> 01:11:10.532
CLEAR.

01:11:10.599 --> 01:11:12.167
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HEAR FROM ME

01:11:12.234 --> 01:11:13.402
OR FROM SQUARE.

01:11:13.469 --> 01:11:15.204
THAT WE WANT YOU TO DILUTE THE

01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:16.905
DATA RIGHTS THAT IS NOT OUR

01:11:16.972 --> 01:11:17.773
POINT.

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:18.907
IN FACT OUR BUSINESS MODEL IS

01:11:18.974 --> 01:11:20.909
PRETTY WELL ALIGNED WITH PRIVACY

01:11:20.976 --> 01:11:21.744
AND SECURITY.

01:11:21.810 --> 01:11:23.912
WHAT WE WANT TO BE THOUGHTFUL

01:11:23.979 --> 01:11:24.813
ABOUT?

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:26.682
IS TO PROTECT THOSE LEADER

01:11:26.749 --> 01:11:28.450
RIGHTS JUST AS YOU DO GDP ARE

01:11:28.517 --> 01:11:30.119
PROTECTS THOSE STRONGLY.

01:11:30.185 --> 01:11:31.820
BUT ALSO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S NOT

01:11:31.887 --> 01:11:34.023
HAVING UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES

01:11:34.089 --> 01:11:36.091
LIKE THE EXAMPLE THAT I GAVE

01:11:36.158 --> 01:11:38.460
WHERE SOMEBODY CAN MISS USE DATA

01:11:38.527 --> 01:11:40.295
THE STOLE FROM ME TO PRETEND TO

01:11:40.362 --> 01:11:41.463
BE ME.

01:11:41.530 --> 01:11:43.799
AND PRETEND TO EXERCISE THOSE

01:11:43.866 --> 01:11:44.933
DATA RIGHTS BECAUSE THIS.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.402
IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I

01:11:46.468 --> 01:11:48.604
WAS MOST ANXIOUS ABOUT WITH JUDY

01:11:48.671 --> 01:11:51.607
PR IS TO MITIGATE THE RISK.

01:11:51.674 --> 01:11:53.275
THAT GDP ARE AT THE DATA RIGHTS

01:11:53.342 --> 01:11:55.744
WILL BECOME AN ATTACK VECTOR TO

01:11:55.811 --> 01:11:57.446
GET YOUR DATA WITHOUT HAVING TO

01:11:57.513 --> 01:12:01.383
HACK SOMEONE.

01:12:01.450 --> 01:12:03.085
ALRIGHT AND THEN --

01:12:03.152 --> 01:12:04.119
MISTER THAGARD SAID THAT HE

01:12:04.186 --> 01:12:05.921
WANTED TO AVOID SOME OF THE

01:12:05.988 --> 01:12:08.223
ISSUES WITH SMALLER COMPANIES

01:12:08.290 --> 01:12:10.492
AND AND HE HAD THE THE LIMIT OF

01:12:10.559 --> 01:12:13.796
THE FIFTY THOUSAND RECORDS AND

01:12:13.862 --> 01:12:16.532
YOU TOOK ISSUE WITH.

01:12:16.598 --> 01:12:17.332
WHAT IS THE REASON OUT OR

01:12:17.399 --> 01:12:19.034
DEVICES SO FOR EXAMPLE THAT'S

01:12:19.101 --> 01:12:20.202
PER YEAR?

01:12:20.269 --> 01:12:22.337
SO IF YOU HAVE A WEBSITE YOU'RE

01:12:22.404 --> 01:12:23.972
AN ARTIST YOU HAVE A WEBSITE.

01:12:24.039 --> 01:12:27.076

SEVEN PER DAY.

01:12:31.814 --> 01:12:32.681
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT MY MATH

01:12:32.748 --> 01:12:34.516
POINT MAY BE SLIGHTLY OFF BUT WE

01:12:34.583 --> 01:12:35.784
BELIEVE THAT IT DOES

01:12:35.851 --> 01:12:37.386
ENCOMPASSING CAPTURE A LOT OF

01:12:37.453 --> 01:12:38.687
SMALL BUSINESSES THAT WE WEREN'T

01:12:38.754 --> 01:12:40.889
MEANT TO BE PART OF THIS WHICH

01:12:40.956 --> 01:12:43.625
IS WHY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT.

01:12:43.692 --> 01:12:45.260
WHEN WE'RE LOOKING A COMPLY WERE

01:12:45.327 --> 01:12:48.630

CONCEPT OF FRAUD AND THE SPECTER

01:13:04.113 --> 01:13:06.081
OF FEAR THAT IT RAISES SO. FOR

01:13:06.148 --> 01:13:07.216
OUR RIGHT OF ACCESS AND FOR A

01:13:07.282 --> 01:13:08.517
RITE OF POLLUTION THERE ONLY

01:13:38.781 --> 01:13:39.348
BECAUSE SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN

01:13:39.414 --> 01:13:40.616
WE CAN'T GIVE PEOPLE ACCESS TO

01:13:50.225 --> 01:13:51.026
ESTABLISH THAT IT IS THE

01:13:51.093 --> 01:13:52.294
CONSUMER TALK ABOUT WE'RE NOT

01:13:52.361 --> 01:13:53.762
INTERESTED IN FRAUD BUT THE IDEA

01:13:53.829 --> 01:13:55.030
THAT BECAUSE SOMETHING MIGHT

01:13:55.097 --> 01:13:56.832
HAPPEN WE SHOULD THEREFORE NOT

01:13:56.899 --> 01:13:57.766
DO IT I THINK IT'S A LITTLE

01:13:57.833 --> 01:13:58.600
SPEECHES.

01:13:58.667 --> 01:13:59.768
AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO BE

01:13:59.835 --> 01:14:00.969
THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THIS.

01:14:01.036 --> 01:14:02.671

01:14:05.107 --> 01:14:06.675
CHANGE WITH THE TIMES BECAUSE

01:14:06.742 --> 01:14:08.177
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT THING.

01:14:08.243 --> 01:14:09.878
CLEARLY WE DON'T WANT TO CREATE

01:14:09.945 --> 01:14:10.913
A MASSIVE FACTOR FOR FRAUD.

01:14:10.979 --> 01:14:11.547
BUT JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING MIGHT

01:14:11.613 --> 01:14:12.881
HAPPEN DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULDN'T

01:14:12.948 --> 01:14:14.483
ALSO GIVE PEOPLE CONTROL OVER

01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:15.450
THE INFORMATION SO WE'RE TRYING

01:14:15.517 --> 01:14:16.919

FIFTY THOUSAND RECORDS.

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:33.836
SO AS PART OF THIS IS A LITTLE

01:14:33.902 --> 01:14:35.037
OUT OF TALK ABOUT --

01:14:35.103 --> 01:14:36.872

IS GETTING MUCH I. P. ADDRESSES.

01:14:55.557 --> 01:14:56.525

01:16:02.557 --> 01:16:03.492
IN IN MAKING SURE THAT WOULD

01:16:03.558 --> 01:16:04.660
PROVIDE THEM WITH MORE

01:16:04.726 --> 01:16:05.494
PROTECTIONS OVER THEIR DATA.

01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:07.763
A LIKE I SAID LAST YEAR --

01:16:07.829 --> 01:16:09.898
YOU KNOW THE WALL WHILE THE

01:16:09.965 --> 01:16:12.567
PROCESS IS WITH A CHANCE TO

01:16:12.634 --> 01:16:14.336
FULLY UNDERSTAND ALL THE

01:16:14.403 --> 01:16:15.337
DIFFERENT IMPLICATIONS OF

01:16:15.404 --> 01:16:17.239
RAMIFICATIONS OF OF THE LANGUAGE

01:16:17.306 --> 01:16:18.507
OF THE LAW --

01:16:18.573 --> 01:16:21.576
AND WHILE I STRONGLY A 100%

01:16:21.643 --> 01:16:22.444
SUPPORT.

01:16:22.511 --> 01:16:23.779
PROVIDING MORE PROTECTIONS IN

01:16:23.845 --> 01:16:24.813
MAKING SURE THAT CONSUMERS OF

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:26.481
MORE MORE CONTROL OVER THE DATA

01:16:26.548 --> 01:16:27.416
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE WALK

01:16:27.482 --> 01:16:29.017
THROUGH THE WHOLE PROCESS AND

01:16:29.084 --> 01:16:29.985
MAKE SURE.

01:16:30.052 --> 01:16:31.119
ARE THERE THINGS IN HERE THAT

01:16:31.186 --> 01:16:33.155
ARE OVERLY ONEROUS ON BUSINESSES

01:16:33.221 --> 01:16:34.756
AND NOT ACTUALLY EFFECTIVE IN

01:16:34.823 --> 01:16:36.325
TERMS OF TRYING TO ACHIEVE OUR

01:16:36.391 --> 01:16:37.559
GOALS -- AND

01:16:37.626 --> 01:16:38.760
SO ONE THING THAT I JUST WANT

01:16:38.827 --> 01:16:40.395
DIVE INTO A LITTLE BIT WHICH MS

01:16:40.462 --> 01:16:40.896
BRING YOU --

01:16:40.963 --> 01:16:43.532
MENTIONED IS THIS IDEA OF A ONE

01:16:43.598 --> 01:16:44.299
EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER --

01:16:44.366 --> 01:16:46.802
AND YOU SAID WELL WE'RE GIVEN AG

01:16:46.868 --> 01:16:47.936
THE AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE THE

01:16:48.003 --> 01:16:50.539
REGULATIONS TO TO FIGURE OUT THE

01:16:50.605 --> 01:16:51.707
BEST PROCESS BUT IT DOES THE

01:16:51.773 --> 01:16:53.241
CURRENT LAW ALSO REQUIRES THAT

01:16:53.308 --> 01:16:54.609
EVERY BUSINESS HAVE AN EIGHT

01:16:54.676 --> 01:16:55.243
HUNDRED NUMBER.

01:16:55.310 --> 01:16:56.912
HOW WOULD YOU DO THAT WITH AN

01:16:56.979 --> 01:16:57.913
EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER I MEAN THAT

01:16:57.980 --> 01:16:59.748
WAS SOMEBODY CALLING IN --

01:16:59.815 --> 01:17:01.049
I I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW A

01:17:01.116 --> 01:17:03.618
BUSINESS COULD POSSIBLY CONFIRM

01:17:03.685 --> 01:17:04.519
THAT SOMEBODY IS WHO THEY SAY

01:17:04.586 --> 01:17:07.089
THEY ARE THROUGH THEM CALLING IN

01:17:07.155 --> 01:17:08.857
AN EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER GATE

01:17:08.924 --> 01:17:09.825
TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW EXPLAIN TO

01:17:09.891 --> 01:17:10.659
ME A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT.

01:17:10.726 --> 01:17:15.364
WHY IT WHY THAT STEP WAS

01:17:15.430 --> 01:17:17.032
REQUIRED LONG?

01:17:17.099 --> 01:17:18.133
SO I THINK THE CONCERN HERE IS

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:20.902
FOR FOLKS WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS.

01:17:20.969 --> 01:17:21.503
TO A COMPUTER NECESSARILY OR

01:17:21.570 --> 01:17:25.173
POTENTIALLY DON'T HAVE ACCESS --

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:28.643
TO A DEVICE AND ACTUALLY LOWER

01:17:28.710 --> 01:17:30.645
INCOME OR OR OR OR LESS EDUCATED

01:17:30.712 --> 01:17:33.315
AND SO THERE'S A IDEA THERE THAT

01:17:33.382 --> 01:17:34.716
WE WANT TO BE SENSITIVE TO

01:17:34.783 --> 01:17:35.283
PEOPLE ACROSS THE SPECTRUM

01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:36.718
CONSUMERS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM.

01:17:36.785 --> 01:17:39.755
AND I DO THINK IT'S WHERE THE AG --

01:17:39.821 --> 01:17:40.355
AND THIS COMMITTEE FRANKLY AS

01:17:40.422 --> 01:17:42.824

OF THESE AREAS TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:17:43.925 --> 01:17:47.362
THEY ARE APPROPRIATE --

01:17:47.429 --> 01:17:49.531
AND AND AGAIN LIKE THAT. ONE OF

01:17:49.598 --> 01:17:52.367
THE REASONS I I I I WAS HAPPY TO

01:17:52.434 --> 01:17:53.535
PULL THE INITIATIVES BECAUSE I

01:17:53.602 --> 01:17:56.038
DO THINK THIS IS THE VENUE --

01:17:56.104 --> 01:17:57.005
FOR MAKING CHANGES AND I DO

01:17:57.072 --> 01:17:58.306
THINK THAT THIS IS AN AREA THAT

01:17:58.373 --> 01:18:00.542
SO COMPLICATED THAT IT WILL NEED

01:18:00.609 --> 01:18:02.811
CHANGES SO --

01:18:02.878 --> 01:18:06.815
TYPE FOR* THAT THANK YOU.

01:18:06.882 --> 01:18:07.749

PROVIDING CALIFORNIANS WITH

01:24:49.717 --> 01:24:52.253
PRIVACY PROTECTION IS CRITICALLY

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:53.888
IMPORTANT NOW MORE THAN EVER.

01:24:53.955 --> 01:24:55.890
HOWEVER THIS CCPA AS IT

01:24:55.957 --> 01:24:57.158
CURRENTLY APPLIES TO THE

01:24:57.225 --> 01:24:58.560
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE

01:24:58.626 --> 01:25:00.528
PRESENTS UNWORKABLE OBLIGATIONS

01:25:00.595 --> 01:25:01.696
AND SERIOUS OPERATIONAL

01:25:01.763 --> 01:25:03.431

01:25:03.498 --> 01:25:05.366
AS ATTORNEY GENERAL BUT THERE

CURE THESE IDENTIFIED FLAWS WILL

01:25:09.003 --> 01:25:10.605

01:25:14.108 --> 01:25:17.745
OF THE C. CPA'S CRITICAL PRIVACY

01:25:17.812 --> 01:25:18.980
WE APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE

01:25:19.047 --> 01:25:20.215
ADDRESSING SOME OF THESE

01:25:20.281 --> 01:25:21.783
CONCERNS LAST YEAR.

BY IT SB ELEVEN TWENTY ONE

01:25:23.852 --> 01:25:24.953
HOWEVER THREE IMPORTANT ONE

01:25:25.019 --> 01:25:26.321
STILL REMAINS.

01:25:26.387 --> 01:25:27.355
FIRST.

01:25:27.422 --> 01:25:29.624
THE CCPA ALLOWS ANY BUSINESS AND

01:25:29.691 --> 01:25:31.159
THIRD PARTY TO SEEK GUIDANCE

01:25:31.226 --> 01:25:32.193
DIRECTLY FROM THE ATTORNEY

01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:34.195
GENERAL ON HOW TO COMPLY WITH

01:25:34.262 --> 01:25:35.063
THE LAW.

01:25:35.129 --> 01:25:36.331
ASKING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S

01:25:36.397 --> 01:25:39.133
OFFICE TO PROVIDE LEGAL COUNSEL

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:41.436
AT TAXPAYERS EXPENSE DIRECTLY

01:25:41.503 --> 01:25:42.470
CONFLICTS WITH OUR

01:25:42.537 --> 01:25:44.138
CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATION TO

01:25:44.205 --> 01:25:46.341
INVESTIGATE AND ENFORCE THE LAW.

01:25:46.407 --> 01:25:47.709
AGAINST ENTITIES THAT VIOLATE

01:25:47.775 --> 01:25:49.611
THOSE LAWS.

01:25:49.677 --> 01:25:51.312
OUR OLIGATION IS TO PROTECT THE

01:25:51.379 --> 01:25:53.615
PRIVACY RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE OF

01:25:53.681 --> 01:25:55.149
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:25:55.216 --> 01:25:56.451
NOT THE BUSINESSES THAT VIOLATE

01:25:56.518 --> 01:25:58.152
THESE LOTS.

01:25:58.219 --> 01:25:59.754
REQUIRING THE USE OF PUBLIC

01:25:59.821 --> 01:26:01.589
FUNDS TO PROVIDE UNLIMITED LEGAL

01:26:01.656 --> 01:26:03.424
ADVICE TO PRIVATE PARTIES WOULD

01:26:03.491 --> 01:26:05.727
BE UNFAIR AND UNCONSCIONABLE NOT

01:26:05.793 --> 01:26:07.061
TO MENTION A WASTE OF VALUABLE

01:26:07.128 --> 01:26:08.997
STATE RESOURCES.

01:26:09.063 --> 01:26:11.466
SECOND THE CCPA PROVIDES A

01:26:11.533 --> 01:26:12.667
BUSINESS WITH THE RIGHT TO CURE

01:26:12.734 --> 01:26:14.736
ANY ALLEGED VIOLATION BEFORE

01:26:14.802 --> 01:26:16.638
BEING HELD A COT ACCOUNTABLE FOR

01:26:16.704 --> 01:26:18.773
BREAKING THE LAW.

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:20.275
THIS WOULD ESSENTIALLY BE A GET

01:26:20.341 --> 01:26:21.709
OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD.

01:26:21.776 --> 01:26:23.111
BUSINESSES WOULD BE PERMITTED TO

01:26:23.177 --> 01:26:25.446
VIOLATE THE LAW EVEN KNOWINGLY

01:26:25.513 --> 01:26:26.581
AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WOULD

01:26:26.648 --> 01:26:28.383
HAVE NO ABILITY TO INITIATE AN

01:26:28.449 --> 01:26:30.151
ENFORCEMENT ACTION WITHOUT

01:26:30.218 --> 01:26:31.653
GIVING THE BUSINESS NOTICE AND

01:26:31.719 --> 01:26:33.054
THE OPPORTUNITY TO CURE THE

01:26:33.121 --> 01:26:34.155
VIOLATION.

01:26:34.222 --> 01:26:34.889
THIS WOULD NOT ONLY

01:26:34.956 --> 01:26:36.324
FUNDAMENTALLY ALTER HOW OUR

01:26:36.391 --> 01:26:38.026

01:26:38.092 --> 01:26:39.594
PROSECUTES CORPORATE MISCONDUCT.

01:26:39.661 --> 01:26:41.296
BUT IT WOULD DRAMATICALLY HINDER

01:26:41.362 --> 01:26:43.298
OUR CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY TO

01:26:43.364 --> 01:26:44.732
PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE

01:26:44.799 --> 01:26:46.301
OF CALIFORNIA.

01:26:46.367 --> 01:26:48.369
EVERYDAY WE ARE SEEING COMPANIES

01:26:48.436 --> 01:26:50.104
BEING CARELESS WITH CALIFORNIANS

01:26:50.171 --> 01:26:52.974
PERSONAL INFORMATION AND DATA.

01:26:53.041 --> 01:26:54.042
THIS EASY P. AS RIGHT TO CURE

01:26:54.108 --> 01:26:55.143
WOULD ALLOW EVEN THE WORST

01:26:55.209 --> 01:26:57.345
OFFENDERS TO RECEIVE A PATH

01:26:57.412 --> 01:26:58.246
RATHER THAN ALLOWING THE

01:26:58.313 --> 01:26:59.647
ATTORNEY GENERAL TO USES

01:26:59.714 --> 01:27:01.382
PROSECUTORIAL DISCRETION

01:27:01.449 --> 01:27:03.084
ENFORCING THE LAW.

01:27:03.151 --> 01:27:04.152
GIVING BUSINESSES THE

01:27:04.218 --> 01:27:05.787
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A FIX THAT

01:27:05.853 --> 01:27:07.221
TICKET DISADVANTAGES BOTH

01:27:07.288 --> 01:27:09.958
CONSUMERS AND HONEST BUSINESSES

01:27:10.024 --> 01:27:12.660
THAT ARE PLAYING BY THE RULES.

01:27:12.727 --> 01:27:13.695
THIRD.

01:27:13.761 --> 01:27:15.229
THIS CPA LACKS A PRIVATE RIGHT

01:27:15.296 --> 01:27:16.631
OF ACTION THAT WOULD ALLOW

01:27:16.698 --> 01:27:18.132

ENFORCE THE RULES CONFERRED BY

01:27:20.702 --> 01:27:22.003

01:27:36.651 --> 01:27:37.752
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL URGES YOU

01:35:07.301 --> 01:35:08.202
WITH THE CPA.

01:35:08.269 --> 01:35:09.537
WE'VE ALREADY ASKED BUSINESSES

01:35:09.603 --> 01:35:11.872
TO INVEST AGREED IT NEEDS TO

01:35:11.939 --> 01:35:13.607
INVEST TO AND THAT MEANS GETTING

01:35:13.674 --> 01:35:15.609
ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO THE AG.

01:35:15.676 --> 01:35:17.178
BUT AS WE THINK THROUGH HOW TO

01:35:17.244 --> 01:35:18.679
ALLOCATE THAT INVESTMENT WE HAVE

01:35:18.746 --> 01:35:20.247
TO ASK OURSELVES WHAT IS THE

01:35:20.314 --> 01:35:21.816
GOAL OF THE CZ PA.

01:35:21.882 --> 01:35:23.417
IS IT FOR LAWSUITS AN ATTORNEY'S

01:35:23.484 --> 01:35:24.418
FEES AS A FOREIGN FORSMAN

01:35:24.485 --> 01:35:27.054
ACTIONS OBVIOUSLY WE HOPE NOT --

01:35:27.121 --> 01:35:28.789
THE GOAL SHOULD BE COMPLIANCE

01:35:28.856 --> 01:35:30.357
AND THAT MEANS THAT A STATE

01:35:30.424 --> 01:35:31.459
INVESTMENT OF RESOURCES FOR THE

01:35:31.525 --> 01:35:33.127
AG TO PROVIDE ADVISORY OPINIONS

01:35:33.194 --> 01:35:35.129
TO BUSINESSES ON HOW TO COMPLY

01:35:35.196 --> 01:35:36.564
WITH THIS COMPLEX AND CONFUSING

01:35:36.630 --> 01:35:38.332
Là WOULD BE MONEY WELL SPENT.

01:35:38.399 --> 01:35:39.767
A STATE INVESTMENT OF RESOURCES

01:35:39.834 --> 01:35:41.535
TO ENSURE THAT BUSINESSES HAVE

01:35:41.602 --> 01:35:43.170
THE OPPORTUNITY IF NEEDED TO

01:35:43.237 --> 01:35:44.004
CURE THEIR APPROACH TO

01:35:44.071 --> 01:35:45.639
IMPLEMENTING THE PRACTICES AND

01:35:45.706 --> 01:35:47.074
PROCEDURES OF THE CCPA WOULD BE

01:35:47.141 --> 01:35:48.375
MONEY WELL SPENT.

01:35:48.442 --> 01:35:49.477
AND FRANKLY THESE KINDS OF

01:35:49.543 --> 01:35:50.711
EDUCATIONAL APPROACHES ARE GONNA

01:35:50.778 --> 01:35:51.946
BE FAR MORE EFFICIENT USE OF

01:35:52.012 --> 01:35:54.949
RESOURCES AND COSTLY ENFORCEMENT

01:35:55.015 --> 01:35:56.617
ACTIONS.

01:35:56.684 --> 01:35:58.452
AND AS FOR THE P. R. A. THE IDEA

01:35:58.519 --> 01:35:59.086
THAT WE'RE WE WOULD ADD A PR A

01:35:59.153 --> 01:36:00.521
TO THIS INCREDIBLY CONFUSING AND

01:36:00.588 --> 01:36:02.289
DETAILED COMPLEX PLOT IS IS

01:36:02.356 --> 01:36:03.157
FRIGHTENING.

01:36:03.224 --> 01:36:04.825
YOU'VE ALL SEEN THE ABUSES THAT

01:36:04.892 --> 01:36:05.693
HAVE STEM FROM HAGA FROM HAVING

01:36:05.759 --> 01:36:06.927
TRIAL LAWYERS AND FORCE THE

01:36:06.994 --> 01:36:07.828
TECHNICALITIES OF GOVERNMENT

01:36:07.895 --> 01:36:09.263
REGULATIONS IN THE EMPLOYMENT

01:36:09.330 --> 01:36:11.198
CONTEXT AND NOW IMAGINE CREATING

01:36:11.265 --> 01:36:13.267
THE SAME SYSTEM HERE FOR THE

01:36:13.334 --> 01:36:14.768
VERY COMPLEX THE CPA.

01:36:14.835 --> 01:36:16.303
AGAIN THEIR PRIVACY EFFORTS WHO

01:36:16.370 --> 01:36:17.938
CAN'T AGREE ON CERTAIN ASPECTS

01:36:18.005 --> 01:36:19.473
OF THIS LAW AND NOW WE'RE

01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:20.541
TALKING ABOUT HAVING TRIAL

01:36:20.608 --> 01:36:21.775
LAWYERS GO AFTER CALIFORNIA

01:36:21.842 --> 01:36:23.644
BUSINESSES TO TEST THEIR ABILITY

01:36:23.711 --> 01:36:24.912
TO DO SO.

01:36:24.979 --> 01:36:25.479
IT WOULD BE A CLASS ACTION

01:36:25.546 --> 01:36:26.914
BONANZA AND AS IT STANDS RIGHT

01:36:26.981 --> 01:36:28.616
NOW 50% OF CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS

01:36:28.682 --> 01:36:29.884
IN THIS COUNTRY ARE FILED RIGHT

01:36:29.950 --> 01:36:31.719
HERE IN CALIFORNIA COURTS.

01:36:31.785 --> 01:36:33.120
IMAGINE JUST HOW MUCH THAT

01:36:33.187 --> 01:36:34.688
NUMBER WOULD INCREASE IF ALL THE

01:36:34.755 --> 01:36:36.757
MANY REQUIREMENTS OF THE CPA ARE

01:36:36.824 --> 01:36:37.358
SUBJECT TO A PRIVATE RIGHT OF

01:36:37.424 --> 01:36:38.325
ACTION.

01:36:38.392 --> 01:36:39.460
ESPECIALLY IN THE YEARS THAT

01:36:39.527 --> 01:36:40.694
COME RIGHT AFTER THIS LAW TAKES

01:36:40.761 --> 01:36:42.062
EFFECT IN BUSINESSES ARE TRYING

01:36:42.129 --> 01:36:43.397
TO FIGURE OUT.

01:36:43.464 --> 01:36:45.399
HOW TO MAKE THIS WORK FRANKLY

01:36:45.466 --> 01:36:46.467
OUR COURT SYSTEM CAN'T HANDLE

01:36:46.534 --> 01:36:48.068
THAT CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES CAN'T

01:36:48.135 --> 01:36:49.703
HANDLE IT AND THE CALIFORNIA

01:36:49.770 --> 01:36:53.073
ECONOMY CAN'T HANDLE THAT?

01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:53.674
WE NEED TO FACE THE FACTS THE

01:36:53.741 --> 01:36:54.975
CCPA IS GOING TO BE INCREDIBLY

01:36:55.042 --> 01:36:56.110
CHALLENGING --

01:36:56.177 --> 01:36:57.211
FOR COMPANIES TO COMPLY WITH

01:36:57.278 --> 01:36:58.779
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT

01:36:58.846 --> 01:37:00.514
THE FACT THAT THE VAST MAJORITY

01:37:00.581 --> 01:37:01.515
OF THE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE TO

01:37:01.582 --> 01:37:03.484
COMPLY ARE NOT THE HANDFUL OF

01:37:03.551 --> 01:37:05.519
TECH GIANTS IN THE STATE.

01:37:05.586 --> 01:37:06.487
IT'S GOING TO BE AN ONGOING

01:37:06.554 --> 01:37:08.022
PROCESS WE NEED TO FIX A LOT

01:37:08.088 --> 01:37:09.356
WITH LEGISLATION IN WAYS THAT

01:37:09.423 --> 01:37:10.324
WERE ABOUT TO DESCRIBE ON THIS

01:37:10.391 --> 01:37:11.525
PANEL HERE TODAY WE NEED TO

01:37:11.592 --> 01:37:12.693
ENSURE THE EACH SHE HAS THE

01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:14.261
APPROPRIATE RESOURCES AND TIME

01:37:14.328 --> 01:37:15.996
TO CRAFT THOUGHTFUL REGULATIONS.

01:37:16.063 --> 01:37:16.630
AND WE NEED TO DO WHATEVER WE

01:37:16.697 --> 01:37:17.998
CAN TO SET BUSINESSES UP FOR

01:37:18.065 --> 01:37:19.333
SUCCESS BECAUSE THE PRIVACY

01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:21.635
GOALS AT THE CCPA THAT WE ALL

01:37:21.702 --> 01:37:23.070
CARE SO MUCH ABOUT WILL BE MET.

01:37:23.137 --> 01:37:24.838
WHEN COMPANIES ARE ACTUALLY ABLE

01:37:24.905 --> 01:37:26.974
TO COMPLY WITH THIS LAW

01:37:27.041 --> 01:37:27.274
[inaudible]

01:37:27.341 --> 01:37:29.743
NOW -- AGAIN

01:37:29.810 --> 01:37:30.110
I SAID.

01:37:30.177 --> 01:37:33.047
SERIBU WITH CAL CHAMBER TELL

01:37:33.113 --> 01:37:34.148
CHAMBER REPRESENTS BUSINESSES

01:37:34.215 --> 01:37:35.749
ACROSS EVERY INDUSTRY INCLUDING

01:37:35.816 --> 01:37:36.750
OVER FOURTEEN THOUSAND SMALL

01:37:36.817 --> 01:37:39.687
BUSINESSES MANY OF WHICH WILL BE

01:37:39.753 --> 01:37:40.654
REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE CCPA.

01:37:40.721 --> 01:37:42.323
OBVIOUSLY EVERYONE HERE KNOWS

01:37:42.389 --> 01:37:44.525
THIS LAW WAS PASSED WITH JUST

01:37:44.592 --> 01:37:45.092
ONE WEEK IN THE LEGISLATIVE

01:37:45.159 --> 01:37:46.594
PROCESS --

01:37:46.660 --> 01:37:47.094
AND THAT WAS DUE TO THE

01:37:47.161 --> 01:37:48.062
IMPENDING DEADLINE TO REMOVE THE

01:37:48.128 --> 01:37:49.530
INITIATIVE FROM THE BALLOT.

01:37:49.597 --> 01:37:51.465
BUT THE RESULT IS THAT ASPECTS

01:37:51.532 --> 01:37:52.833
OF THIS LAW ARE CONFUSING AND

01:37:52.900 --> 01:37:54.401
THEY DO PRESENT SERIOUS PRIVACY

01:37:54.468 --> 01:37:56.203

01:37:58.205 --> 01:37:59.440
DESPITE THAT REALITY IT IT FEELS

01:37:59.506 --> 01:38:01.141

WE TOUCHED ON THIS EARLIER --

01:38:15.122 --> 01:38:17.091
IN THE LAST PANEL IT WAS IT WAS

01:38:17.157 --> 01:38:19.393
DISCUSSED THAT THE CCPA APPLIES

01:38:19.460 --> 01:38:19.994
TO A MASSIVE SCOPE BUSINESSES

MORE --

01:38:26.367 --> 01:38:27.635

WOULD NOT HAVE TO COMPLY WITH

01:38:45.853 --> 01:38:48.656
THIS LOT.

01:38:48.722 --> 01:38:50.557

DAY.

01:39:07.574 --> 01:39:08.809

COULD BE COUNTED MULTIPLE TIMES

01:39:27.027 --> 01:39:28.595
FOR EXAMPLE.

01:39:28.662 --> 01:39:30.064

OF OUR SCHOOLS PRIVACY LAW

01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:34.081
CERTIFICATE I'VE BEEN AN

01:42:34.147 --> 01:42:36.216
INTERNET LAWYER FOR ABOUT TWENTY

01:42:36.283 --> 01:42:37.317
FIVE YEARS --

01:42:37.384 --> 01:42:38.952
MY REMARKS TODAY FOCUS ON THE

01:42:39.019 --> 01:42:40.087
DEFINITION OF PERSONAL

01:42:40.153 --> 01:42:41.455
INFORMATION --

01:42:41.522 --> 01:42:43.090
THIS DEFINITIONS A CRITICAL

01:42:43.156 --> 01:42:44.324
PIECE OF THE LAW BECAUSE IT

01:42:44.391 --> 01:42:45.959
DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN THE

01:42:46.026 --> 01:42:47.594
REGULATED AND UNREGULATED

01:42:47.661 --> 01:42:49.196
INFORMATION --

01:42:49.263 --> 01:42:50.297
AN OVERBROAD DEFINITION OF

01:42:50.364 --> 01:42:52.065
PERSONAL INFORMATION CREATES --

01:42:52.132 --> 01:42:53.000
THE PROBLEM THROUGHOUT THE

01:42:53.066 --> 01:42:54.434
ENTIRE LAW WHICH I THINK IS THE

01:42:54.501 --> 01:42:56.837
CASE TODAY --

01:42:56.904 --> 01:42:57.971
THE DEFINITION PERSONAL RATIONS

01:42:58.038 --> 01:43:00.374
DEFINED TO INCLUDE INFORMATION

01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:01.808
THAT IS REASONABLY CAPABLE OF

01:43:01.875 --> 01:43:02.676
BEING ASSOCIATED WITH A

01:43:02.743 --> 01:43:05.112
PARTICULAR CONSUMER OR HOUSEHOLD.

01:43:05.178 --> 01:43:07.848
IS A BUNCH OF EXCEPTIONS --

01:43:07.915 --> 01:43:09.316
TO THERE'S MUCH EXAMPLES OF WHAT

01:43:09.383 --> 01:43:10.951
THAT MIGHT INCLUDE --

01:43:11.018 --> 01:43:12.286
THE DEFINITION DOESN'T LIMIT

01:43:12.352 --> 01:43:16.823
ITSELF -- TO

01:43:16.890 --> 01:43:17.991
TO SENSITIVE OR OBVIOUSLY

01:43:18.058 --> 01:43:20.627
IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION SUCH AS

01:43:20.694 --> 01:43:22.863
NAME OR PHONE NUMBER OR SOCIAL

01:43:22.930 --> 01:43:23.397
SECURITY NUMBER.

01:43:23.463 --> 01:43:25.933
IT SITS UP EVERY SCRAP OF DATA --

01:43:25.999 --> 01:43:26.733
THAT -- HAS

01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:29.303
THE THEORETICAL CAPABILITY OF

01:43:29.369 --> 01:43:29.836
BEING ASSOCIATED WITH THE

01:43:29.903 --> 01:43:33.173
CONSUMER --

01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:33.774
UNFORTUNATELY THIS DEFINITION

01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:37.377
CRATES TODAY [inaudible]

01:43:37.444 --> 01:43:41.415
UP FIRST ANY INFORMATION --

01:43:41.481 --> 01:43:43.584
THAT RELATES TO CONSUMERS COUNTS

01:43:43.650 --> 01:43:45.052
AS PERSONAL INFORMATION NO

01:43:45.118 --> 01:43:46.253
MATTER WHAT STEPS A BUSINESS

01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:48.455
MIGHT TAKE TO AVOID THAT OUTCOME.

01:43:48.522 --> 01:43:50.691
THE LAW INCLUDES SOME CONSUMER A

01:43:50.757 --> 01:43:52.859
DAY EXCLUDES SOME CONSUMER DATA

01:43:52.926 --> 01:43:54.461
FROM THE DEFINITION OF PERSONAL

01:43:54.528 --> 01:43:55.362
INFORMATION.

01:43:55.429 --> 01:43:56.630
BUT THE SOLUTIONS THAT WORK THE

01:43:56.697 --> 01:43:57.864
REASON WHY IS THAT COMPUTER

01:43:57.931 --> 01:44:00.300
SCIENTIST INCREASINGLY CAN FIND

01:44:00.367 --> 01:44:01.935
WAYS TO ASSOCIATE INNOCUOUS BITS

01:44:02.002 --> 01:44:03.103
OF DATA WITH --

01:44:03.170 --> 01:44:05.639
INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS AS A RESULT

01:44:05.706 --> 01:44:06.940
AT VIRTUALLY EVERY PIECE OF

01:44:07.007 --> 01:44:08.909
INFORMATION FROM ABOUT CONSUMERS

01:44:08.976 --> 01:44:10.711
TECHNICALLY MEETS THE STATUTORY

01:44:10.777 --> 01:44:13.547
DEFINITION OF OF BEING RECENTLY

01:44:13.614 --> 01:44:16.249
CAPABLE OF BEING ATTRIBUTED. TO

01:44:16.316 --> 01:44:17.784
A PARTICULAR CONSUMER HOUSEHOLD

01:44:17.851 --> 01:44:19.620
SO DESPITE THE LAWS CLEAR INTENT

01:44:19.686 --> 01:44:21.054
OTHERWISE --

01:44:21.121 --> 01:44:22.589
THE LAW TREATS ALL DATA IN A

01:44:22.656 --> 01:44:23.857
BUSINESSES POSSESSION AS

01:44:23.924 --> 01:44:24.992
PERSONAL INFORMATION AND

01:44:25.058 --> 01:44:27.160
SUBJECTS THAT DATA TO THIS LOS

01:44:27.227 --> 01:44:28.695
STRICT REQUIREMENTS.

01:44:28.762 --> 01:44:30.464
OF MOST A LAWS OBLIGATIONS THAT

01:44:30.530 --> 01:44:32.499
INCLUDES PORTABILITY DISCLOSURES

01:44:32.566 --> 01:44:34.301
DELETIONS BECOME --

01:44:34.368 --> 01:44:37.004
IMPOSSIBLE TO ADMINISTER IF ALL

01:44:37.070 --> 01:44:38.639
THE INFORMATION AND CAN IN IT

01:44:38.705 --> 01:44:42.709
BUT THIS IS POSSESSION IS

01:44:42.776 --> 01:44:44.978
TREATED AS PERSONAL INFORMATION.

01:44:45.045 --> 01:44:46.880
THE SECOND CONCERN IS THAT THE

01:44:46.947 --> 01:44:47.581
LAW CREATES AN UNTENABLE

01:44:47.648 --> 01:44:48.849
SITUATION WHEN A CONSUMERS

01:44:48.915 --> 01:44:49.783
PERSONAL INFORMATION RESIDES IN

01:44:49.850 --> 01:44:51.418
MULTIPLE DATABASES AND THE

01:44:51.485 --> 01:44:52.052
CONSUMER TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE

01:44:52.119 --> 01:44:53.654
STATUTORY RIGHTS. TO ACCESS OR

01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:55.555
DELETE THAT INFORMATION SO LET

01:44:55.622 --> 01:44:56.823
ME GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THIS

01:44:56.890 --> 01:44:57.924
MIGHT WORK --

01:44:57.991 --> 01:44:59.292
ANOMALY RETAILER MIGHT ALLOW

01:44:59.359 --> 01:45:00.761
CONSUMER TO CREATE A PERSONAL

01:45:00.827 --> 01:45:02.429
PROFILE --

01:45:02.496 --> 01:45:03.764
AND IT MIGHT ALSO A SEPARATE

01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:06.733
DATABASE WORD DELIVERS CUSTOM --

01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:09.603
PERSONALIZED DEALS BASED ON THE

01:45:09.670 --> 01:45:11.238
IF THE CONSUMER ASK THE RETAILER

01:45:11.304 --> 01:45:12.739
TO TO LEAD ALL THE INFORMATION

01:45:12.806 --> 01:45:13.840
IN -- ALL

01:45:13.907 --> 01:45:15.008
ALL OF HIS OR HER PERSONAL

01:45:15.075 --> 01:45:16.043
INFORMATION --

01:45:16.109 --> 01:45:17.611
THAT MIGHT BE EASY TO DO FOR THE

01:45:17.678 --> 01:45:18.979
CONSUMER PROFILE BUT THEN THE

01:45:19.046 --> 01:45:20.247
QUESTION IS WHAT'S THE BUSINESS

01:45:20.313 --> 01:45:21.748
GOING TO DO ABOUT THE I. P.

01:45:21.815 --> 01:45:23.483
ADDRESS IN THE SEPARATE --

01:45:23.550 --> 01:45:25.385
OFFERS DATABASE THE LAW SIMPLY

01:45:25.452 --> 01:45:26.653
REQUIRES THE RETAILER TO

01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:28.221
DETERMINE THE CONSUMERS IP

01:45:28.288 --> 01:45:30.223
ADDRESS IF THAT'S EVEN POSSIBLE

01:45:30.290 --> 01:45:32.092
MANY I. P. ADDRESSES ARE SHARED

01:45:32.159 --> 01:45:33.927
LIKE ON A WIFI NETWORK UPDATE

01:45:33.994 --> 01:45:34.928
RETAILER.

01:45:34.995 --> 01:45:36.063
DETERMINE THAT BELONG TO THE

01:45:36.129 --> 01:45:37.497
CONSUMER AND THEN DELETED.

01:45:37.564 --> 01:45:38.699
THIS REQUEST BECOMES EVEN MORE

01:45:38.765 --> 01:45:40.400
UNREALISTIC WITH OFFLINE DATA

01:45:40.467 --> 01:45:42.335
SAVED SECURITY --

01:45:42.402 --> 01:45:44.071
CAMERA FOOTAGE OF THE CONSUMERS

01:45:44.137 --> 01:45:45.539
SHOPPING IN THE STORE WHERE

01:45:45.605 --> 01:45:47.674
SALES PERSONS NOTE OF THEIR

01:45:47.741 --> 01:45:50.444
INTERACTIONS WITH THE CUSTOMER --

01:45:50.510 --> 01:45:52.045
LOTS SAYS IT LINKING ACROSS

01:45:52.112 --> 01:45:53.580
DATABASES IS REQUIRED BUT THIS

01:45:53.647 --> 01:45:56.016
ONLY APPLIES IF THE INFORMATION

01:45:56.083 --> 01:45:57.317
AND OTHER DATA BASES ISN'T

01:45:57.384 --> 01:45:59.119
ITSELF PERSONAL INFORMATION.

01:45:59.186 --> 01:46:01.154
BUT SENSE VIRTUALLY ALL DAY THE

01:46:01.221 --> 01:46:02.122
IN --

01:46:02.189 --> 01:46:03.990
BUSINESS VISION IS CHARACTERIZED

01:46:04.057 --> 01:46:05.659
AS PERSONAL INFORMATION DECISION

01:46:05.726 --> 01:46:08.328
ACTUALLY DOESN'T HELP INSTEAD

01:46:08.395 --> 01:46:09.730
THE LAW MECHANIC PRODUCTIVELY

01:46:09.796 --> 01:46:11.998
REQUIRE BUSINESSES TO DIGITIZE

01:46:12.065 --> 01:46:14.534
MORE DATA SO THEY CAN --

01:46:14.601 --> 01:46:15.669
AND PROACTIVELY LINK THEIR

01:46:15.736 --> 01:46:17.337
DATABASES SO THEY CAN MAKE THOSE

01:46:17.404 --> 01:46:22.843
FUTURE ACCESS OR DELETION

01:46:22.909 --> 01:46:25.078
REQUEST EASIER --

01:46:25.145 --> 01:46:25.712
THE THIRD --

01:46:25.779 --> 01:46:26.780
CONCERN I HAVE IS THE DEFINITION

01:46:26.847 --> 01:46:28.048
OF PERSONAL INFORMATION EXCLUDE

01:46:28.115 --> 01:46:29.216
SOME GOVERNMENT --

01:52:16.229 --> 01:52:17.363
INDIVIDUALS WHO DON'T HAVE A

01:52:17.430 --> 01:52:20.900
TRUE CONSUMER RELATIONSHIP WITH

01:52:20.967 --> 01:52:22.502
THE BUSINESS WILL BE EXORBITANT.

01:52:22.569 --> 01:52:24.404
LET'S USE AN EXAMPLE A SMALL

01:52:24.471 --> 01:52:25.705
FAMILY OWNED RESTAURANT THAT

01:52:25.772 --> 01:52:27.674
SERVES ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TABLES

01:52:27.740 --> 01:52:28.975
A DAY WILL HAVE TO

01:52:29.042 --> 01:52:31.144
OPERATIONALIZE THE CCPA AS IN

01:52:31.211 --> 01:52:32.645
ITS CURRENT FORM. FOR ITS

01:52:32.712 --> 01:52:34.280
KITCHEN WAIT STAFF.

01:52:34.347 --> 01:52:36.449
IN A BUSINESS WITH A VERY HIGH

01:52:36.516 --> 01:52:38.485
TURNOVER RATE --

01:52:38.551 --> 01:52:39.819
ALSO ACCESS TO PERSONAL

01:52:39.886 --> 01:52:40.954
INFORMATION IN THE EMPLOYMENT

01:52:41.020 --> 01:52:42.689
CONTEXT IS ALREADY ESTABLISHED

01:52:42.755 --> 01:52:44.491
IN CALIFORNIA A LOT.

01:52:44.557 --> 01:52:45.959
EMPLOYEES ALREADY HAVE THE RIGHT

01:52:46.025 --> 01:52:47.327
TO ACCESS THE PERSONAL RECORDS

01:52:47.393 --> 01:52:48.661
BUT THE CCPA WOULD ACTUALLY

01:52:48.728 --> 01:52:51.531
ALLOW A SEPARATED SPOUSE IN THE

01:52:51.598 --> 01:52:54.601
SAME HOUSEHOLD. TO GAIN ACCESS

01:52:54.667 --> 01:52:56.402
TO THEIR HOUSES THEY'RE

01:52:56.469 --> 01:52:57.403
SEPARATED THOUSANDS PAYROLL

01:52:57.470 --> 01:52:58.638
RECORDS IF THEY'RE IN THE

01:52:58.705 --> 01:52:59.405
HOUSEHOLD.

01:52:59.472 --> 01:53:01.708
THAT CANNOT BE WITH THE

01:53:01.774 --> 01:53:03.243
LEGISLATURE INTENDED.

01:53:03.309 --> 01:53:04.477
THE DEFINITION OF CONSUMER IS

01:53:04.544 --> 01:53:06.012
ALSO PROBLEMATIC IN THAT IT

01:53:06.079 --> 01:53:07.280
CURRENTLY ENCOMPASSES BUSINESS

01:53:07.347 --> 01:53:09.048
REPRESENTATIVES IN THE CONTEXT

01:53:09.115 --> 01:53:10.183
OF BUSINESS TO BUSINESS

01:53:10.250 --> 01:53:11.551
TRANSACTIONS.

01:53:11.618 --> 01:53:13.286
THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO WE ARE OPT

01:53:13.353 --> 01:53:15.388
OUT OF BUSINESS DATA IN A

01:53:15.455 --> 01:53:16.956
BUSINESS TO BUSINESS TRANSACTION.

01:53:17.023 --> 01:53:18.691
COULD RESULT IN FRAUD AND MAKE

01:53:18.758 --> 01:53:21.060
IT IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPLY WITH DUE

01:53:21.127 --> 01:53:22.295
DILIGENCE REQUIREMENTS.

01:53:22.362 --> 01:53:24.631
IMAGINE ALSO WHAT THIS MEANS FOR

01:53:24.697 --> 01:53:26.466
AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE A SMALL

01:53:26.533 --> 01:53:28.935
MEDICAL PRACTICE THAT ALREADY

01:53:29.002 --> 01:53:30.136
COMPLIES WITH HIPAA FOR PATIENT

01:53:30.203 --> 01:53:30.870
DATA.

01:53:30.937 --> 01:53:33.106
BUT THAT WILL NOW BE REQUIRED TO

01:53:33.173 --> 01:53:34.340
HONOR OPT OUT AND DELETION

01:53:34.407 --> 01:53:36.743
REQUEST FROM SUPPLIERS WITH WHOM

01:53:36.809 --> 01:53:38.011
THE EMAIL.

01:53:38.077 --> 01:53:39.879
BUT EVEN WHERE THOSE SUPPLIERS

01:53:39.946 --> 01:53:40.980
DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO PATIENT

01:53:41.047 --> 01:53:43.249
DATA THEY HAVE TO HONOR THE

01:53:43.316 --> 01:53:43.983
HONOR THE OPT OUT IN SOLUTION

01:53:44.050 --> 01:53:44.918
RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE THERE

01:53:44.984 --> 01:53:47.453
EMAILING WITH THE SUPPLIERS

01:53:47.520 --> 01:53:48.721
THAT'S HOW THIS WORKS RIGHT NOW.

01:53:48.788 --> 01:53:51.758
IN WASHINGTON STATE SENATE BILL

01:53:51.824 --> 01:53:52.258
FIFTY THREE SEVENTY SIX

01:53:52.325 --> 01:53:54.394
EXPLICITLY EXCLUDES.

01:53:54.460 --> 01:53:56.996
EMPLOYEES OR CONTRACTORS OF A

01:53:57.063 --> 01:53:58.198
BUSINESS WHEN THEY'RE ACTING IN

01:53:58.264 --> 01:54:00.567
THOSE ROLES FROM THE DEFINITION

01:54:00.633 --> 01:54:02.635
CONSUMER IN SECTION.

01:54:02.702 --> 01:54:03.236
THREE CALIFORNIA SHOULD DO THE

01:54:03.303 --> 01:54:04.504
SAME.

01:54:04.571 --> 01:54:05.505
I WILL NOW TURN TO THE PRIVATE

01:54:05.572 --> 01:54:07.207
RIGHT OF ACTION.

01:54:07.273 --> 01:54:08.608
AS YOU ALL KNOW THE CCPA

01:54:08.675 --> 01:54:10.276
CURRENTLY ALLOWS CONSUMER TO

01:54:10.343 --> 01:54:12.912
SEEK STATUTORY DAMAGES OF ONE

01:54:12.979 --> 01:54:13.513
HUNDRED TO SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY

01:54:13.580 --> 01:54:16.649
DOLLARS PER PERSON PER INCIDENT.

01:54:16.716 --> 01:54:17.217
WITHOUT ANY DEMONSTRATION OF

01:54:17.283 --> 01:54:18.484
HEART --

01:54:18.551 --> 01:54:19.519
WHAT'S REQUIRED IS THAT THE

01:54:19.586 --> 01:54:21.387
CONSUMERS PERSONAL INFORMATION

01:54:21.454 --> 01:54:22.655
IS SUBJECT TO AN UNAUTHORIZED

01:54:22.722 --> 01:54:24.057
ACCESS AND EXFILTRATION AFTER

01:54:24.123 --> 01:54:25.391
DISCLOSURE.

01:54:25.458 --> 01:54:26.559
AS A RESULT OF A BUSINESS IS A

01:54:26.626 --> 01:54:28.328
VIOLATION OF THE DUTY TO

01:54:28.394 --> 01:54:29.862
IMPLEMENT MAINTAIN REASONABLE

01:54:29.929 --> 01:54:31.030
SECURITY PROCEDURES.

01:54:31.097 --> 01:54:32.065
WE'VE HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

01:54:32.131 --> 01:54:34.133
REASONABLE SECURITY TODAY AS WE

01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:35.101
UNDERSTAND IT.

01:54:35.168 --> 01:54:36.836
THE CGPA WAS MEANT TO EXCLUDE

01:54:36.903 --> 01:54:38.738
ENCRYPTED DATA WE HEARD ABOUT

01:54:38.805 --> 01:54:40.273
THAT ALSO AS WELL AS REDACTED

01:54:40.340 --> 01:54:41.007
DATA.

01:54:41.074 --> 01:54:42.675
WE ALSO HEARD FROM MR RETIRED

01:54:42.742 --> 01:54:43.743
ABOUT THAT.

01:54:43.810 --> 01:54:44.877
UNFORTUNATELY THE CURRENT

01:54:44.944 --> 01:54:46.012
LANGUAGE DOESN'T EXACTLY SAY

01:54:46.079 --> 01:54:47.680
THAT SO WE'D LIKE TO SEE THAT

01:54:47.747 --> 01:54:48.748
ADDRESSED.

01:54:48.815 --> 01:54:49.482
WHAT WHAT DO WE ACTUALLY KNOW

01:54:49.549 --> 01:54:52.018
ABOUT THAT WANT TO TALK ABOUT

01:54:52.085 --> 01:54:53.353
THIS FOR A MOMENT WE KNOW THAT

01:54:53.419 --> 01:54:55.288
EVERY BUSINESS HAS EITHER HAD

01:54:55.355 --> 01:54:56.923
THE DATA SECURITY BREACH EVERY

01:54:56.990 --> 01:54:57.724
BUSINESS?

01:54:57.790 --> 01:54:58.891
HAS EITHER HAD A DATA SECURITY

01:54:58.958 --> 01:55:00.593
BREACH OR WILL.

01:55:00.660 --> 01:55:02.562
EVEN IF THEY HAVE IMPLEMENTED

01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:04.063
REASONABLE SECURITY PROCEDURES

01:55:04.130 --> 01:55:05.932
AND PRACTICES.

01:55:05.999 --> 01:55:07.767
IT IS THE NATURE OF THE WORLD IN

01:55:07.834 --> 01:55:09.068
WHICH WE LIVE TODAY.

01:55:09.135 --> 01:55:10.770
THE PARLIAMENT INSTITUTE AND

01:55:10.837 --> 01:55:12.472
POLITICS JUST ISSUE THE RESULTS

01:55:12.538 --> 01:55:14.540
OF A GLOBAL SURVEY OF SIX

01:55:14.607 --> 01:55:15.975
HUNDRED OR MORE CYBERSECURITY

01:55:16.042 --> 01:55:17.610
LEADERS IN PROFESSIONAL SHOWING

01:55:17.677 --> 01:55:19.312
THAT 67%.

01:55:19.379 --> 01:55:20.813
OF ORGANIZATIONS ARE NOT

01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:22.482
CONFIDENT THAT THEY CAN AVOID A

01:55:22.548 --> 01:55:24.350
DATA BREACH. ONE OF THE MOST

01:55:24.417 --> 01:55:26.352
PERVASIVE THREATS TO COMPANIES

01:55:26.419 --> 01:55:28.554
IS PHISHING ATTACKS WHICH ARE

01:55:28.621 --> 01:55:29.022
BECOMING INCREASINGLY

01:55:29.088 --> 01:55:30.323
SOPHISTICATED.

01:55:30.390 --> 01:55:31.424
SO THIS IS CRITICAL TO

01:55:31.491 --> 01:55:32.525
UNDERSTAND EVEN IF AN

01:55:32.592 --> 01:55:34.861
ORGANIZATION HOUSING CRYPTID ALL

01:55:34.927 --> 01:55:36.763
THE PERSONAL INFORMATION.

01:55:36.829 --> 01:55:38.665
THAT IS NO SHIELD TO A FISHING

01:55:38.731 --> 01:55:39.565
ATTACK.

01:55:39.632 --> 01:55:40.933
BECAUSE IT APPEARS TO BE A

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.536
LEGITIMATE BUSINESS REQUEST.

01:55:43.603 --> 01:55:44.837
SO LET'S GO BACK TO THE SMALL

01:55:44.904 --> 01:55:45.938
FAMILY OWNED RESTAURANTS.

01:55:46.005 --> 01:55:47.507
THE RESTAURANTS NIGHT MANAGER

01:55:47.573 --> 01:55:49.809
DISCOVERS THAT HIS EMAILS BEEN

01:55:49.876 --> 01:55:50.443
COMPROMISED OR PHISHING SCAM.

01:55:50.510 --> 01:55:52.178
THAT APPEARED TO COME FROM HIS

01:55:52.245 --> 01:55:53.680
OUTSOURCED IT GUY.

01:55:53.746 --> 01:55:54.847
AND ASKED HIM TO ENTER HIS

01:55:54.914 --> 01:55:56.282
CREDENTIALS.

01:55:56.349 --> 01:55:57.283
NOW HE SUSPECTS THAT THE BAD

01:55:57.350 --> 01:55:58.951
GUYS PROBABLY HAD ACCESS TO

01:55:59.018 --> 01:55:59.886
PERSONAL INFORMATION OF

01:55:59.952 --> 01:56:01.888
RESTAURANT CUSTOMERS THAT WERE

01:56:01.954 --> 01:56:02.989
IN HIS ACCOUNT.

01:56:03.056 --> 01:56:05.325
CALIFORNIA LAW ALREADY SAYS THAT

01:56:05.391 --> 01:56:06.626
THE BUSINESS THE RESTAURANT HAS

01:56:06.693 --> 01:56:07.694
TO NOTIFY THOSE AFFECTED

01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:09.095
INDIVIDUALS AND BY THE WAY IF

01:56:09.162 --> 01:56:10.129
THERE'S MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED

01:56:10.196 --> 01:56:11.364
AND THEY ALSO HAVE TO NOTIFY THE

01:56:11.431 --> 01:56:12.699
AG'S OFFICE.

01:56:12.765 --> 01:56:14.267
UNDER THE CCPA EACH OF THOSE

01:56:14.334 --> 01:56:15.401
AFFECTED INDIVIDUALS CAN NOW

01:56:15.468 --> 01:56:17.704
THROUGH THE RESTAURANT FOR ONE

01:56:17.770 --> 01:56:18.271
HUNDRED SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY

01:56:18.338 --> 01:56:20.440
DOLLARS PER PERSON PER INCIDENT

01:56:20.506 --> 01:56:20.973
WHERE THEY CAN BRING CLASS

01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:21.574
ACTION.

01:56:21.641 --> 01:56:24.010
YOU CAN SEE HOW THE SITUATION

01:56:24.077 --> 01:56:26.045
QUICKLY SPIRALS OUT OF CONTROL.

01:56:26.112 --> 01:56:26.612
IF THAT'S SMALL RESTAURANT

01:56:26.679 --> 01:56:29.148
SERVES EVEN JUST WANT RUMORS A

01:56:29.215 --> 01:56:31.951
WEEK OR SLIGHTLY MORE THAN FIFTY

01:56:32.018 --> 01:56:32.585
THOUSAND UNIQUE CREDIT CARDS A

01:56:32.652 --> 01:56:34.487
YEAR.

01:56:34.554 --> 01:56:36.055
THE DAMAGE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO

01:56:36.122 --> 01:56:38.024
THE CLASS WOULD RANGE BETWEEN

01:56:38.091 --> 01:56:39.058
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ON THE LOW

01:56:39.125 --> 01:56:41.561
END AND THIRTY SEVEN AND A HALF

01:56:41.627 --> 01:56:43.129
MILLION DOLLARS ON THE HIGH END.

01:56:43.196 --> 01:56:44.564
EVEN THE LOW END OF THAT RANGE

01:56:44.630 --> 01:56:45.565
PLUS ATTORNEY'S FEES WOULD BE

01:56:45.631 --> 01:56:47.567
ENOUGH TO BUY IT BANKRUPT ANY

01:56:47.633 --> 01:56:49.669
SMALL BUSINESS.

01:56:49.736 --> 01:56:50.603
IS WITHOUT POTENTIAL LIABILITY

01:56:50.670 --> 01:56:51.404
IS BUSINESS OWNERS WILL BE

01:56:51.471 --> 01:56:52.839
FORCED TO ENTER INTO IMMEDIATE

01:56:52.905 --> 01:56:54.207
SETTLEMENT.

01:56:54.273 --> 01:56:55.208
BECAUSE THE COSTS OF LITIGATION

01:56:55.274 --> 01:56:56.275
ARE SO HIGH.

01:56:56.342 --> 01:56:57.810
EVEN IF THEY THINK THEY HAVE A

01:56:57.877 --> 01:56:59.545
GOOD DEFENSE BASED ON REASONABLE

01:56:59.612 --> 01:57:01.514
SECURITY THEY'RE GONNA BE FORCED

01:57:01.581 --> 01:57:04.550
TO SETTLE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T

01:57:04.617 --> 01:57:05.752
AFFORD WOULD GAIN.

01:57:05.818 --> 01:57:06.953
THE NET RESULT IS THAT THE TRIAL

01:57:07.019 --> 01:57:07.954
ATTORNEYS WHEN BUTTHE CONSUMERS

01:57:08.020 --> 01:57:09.322
WILL BE ANY MORE PROTECTIVE THAN

01:57:09.389 --> 01:57:10.590
THEY ARE TODAY.

01:57:10.656 --> 01:57:13.092
AS NOTED ALREADY IS NOT IF BUT

01:57:13.159 --> 01:57:14.460
WHEN A COMPANY WILL HAVE A DATA

01:57:14.527 --> 01:57:15.828
SECURITY BREACH.

01:57:15.895 --> 01:57:16.929
AND THE ATTACKS ARE BECOMING

01:57:16.996 --> 01:57:17.964
MORE SOPHISTICATED WITH

01:57:18.030 --> 01:57:19.599
ORGANIZED CRIME IN NATION STATES

01:57:19.665 --> 01:57:21.801
IN THE GAME.

01:57:21.868 --> 01:57:23.136
CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES ARE THE

01:57:23.202 --> 01:57:24.504
VICTIMS OF THESE ATTACKS BUT

01:57:24.570 --> 01:57:26.572
THEY ARE PUNISHED BY THIS LAW.

01:57:26.639 --> 01:57:28.241
THIS IS A SLEDGE HAMMER IT'S NOT

01:57:28.307 --> 01:57:30.309
A STICK AND A COMES A POINT WHEN

01:57:30.376 --> 01:57:31.878
DETERRENCE HAS DIMINISHING

01:57:31.944 --> 01:57:33.279
RETURNS.

01:57:33.346 --> 01:57:35.314
YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO

01:57:35.381 --> 01:57:37.049
MAKE THIS LEGISLATION EVEN MORE

01:57:37.116 --> 01:57:38.584
PROTECTIVE OF THE CONSUMERS AS

01:57:38.651 --> 01:57:39.852
OPPOSED TO THEIR LAWYERS.

01:57:39.919 --> 01:57:41.587
AND LESS DAMAGING TO THE

01:57:41.654 --> 01:57:44.023
CALIFORNIA ECONOMY AS A WHOLE BY

01:57:44.090 --> 01:57:45.258
CREATING A SAFE HARBOR TO THIS

01:57:45.324 --> 01:57:46.259
ONEROUS LIABILITY.

01:57:46.325 --> 01:57:47.727
BEYOND JUST THE ENCRYPTION

01:57:47.794 --> 01:57:49.595
REDACTION OR REASONABLE SECURITY

01:57:49.662 --> 01:57:50.863
AS I MENTIONED THERE ARE THINGS

01:57:50.930 --> 01:57:52.899
LIKE FISHING THE DO NOT THAT

01:57:52.965 --> 01:57:54.834
THOSE THINGS CANNOT ADDRESS.

01:57:54.901 --> 01:57:56.536
OR BY SIMPLY REMOVING THE

01:57:56.602 --> 01:57:57.103
MINIMUM AMOUNT OF STATUTORY

01:57:57.170 --> 01:57:58.271
DAMAGES.

01:57:58.337 --> 01:57:59.739
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND YOUR

01:57:59.806 --> 01:58:01.040

BUSINESS CANNOT DISCRIMINATE

01:59:06.739 --> 01:59:07.940

02:22:56.200 --> 02:22:58.036
A MECHANISM FOR CALIFORNIANS TO

02:22:58.102 --> 02:23:00.238
STOP THE SALE OF OUR PERSONAL

02:23:00.305 --> 02:23:01.906

02:23:01.973 --> 02:23:04.742
ON EACH OF US TO OPT OUT. TO

02:23:04.809 --> 02:23:06.344
UNDERSTAND WHY WE MUST HAVE THE

02:23:06.411 --> 02:23:07.679
POWER TO CONTROL ALL THE WAYS

02:23:07.745 --> 02:23:09.280
OUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IS

02:23:09.347 --> 02:23:11.716
SHARED AND NOT JUST SOLD.

02:23:11.783 --> 02:23:13.618
CONSIDER FOR A MOMENT THAT THESE

02:23:13.685 --> 02:23:16.120
PROCLAIMS THAT IT DOES NOT SELL

02:23:16.187 --> 02:23:21.459

INSTEAD FACEBOOK CLAIMS IT JUST

02:23:22.794 --> 02:23:24.696
SHARES PERSONAL INFORMATION AND

02:23:24.762 --> 02:23:26.064
THE SCOPE OF THE SHARING IS

02:23:26.130 --> 02:23:27.932
TRULY DIZZYING IT IS THE

02:23:27.999 --> 02:23:29.600

02:23:31.569 --> 02:23:32.670
DOZEN DIFFERENT WAYS.

02:23:32.737 --> 02:23:34.973
APPS WEBSITES INTEGRATIONS

02:23:35.039 --> 02:23:37.075
DEVELOPERS PARTNERS AND MORE AND

02:23:37.141 --> 02:23:39.143
IT'S NOT JUST FACEBOOK MOST OF

02:23:39.210 --> 02:23:40.178
THE MAJOR TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES

02:23:40.244 --> 02:23:41.646
REPRESENTED BY THE BUSINESS

02:23:41.713 --> 02:23:43.348
GROUPS THIS MORNING. TO MAKE

02:23:43.414 --> 02:23:45.550
SOME OR ALL OF THEIR MONEY MY

02:23:45.616 --> 02:23:47.352
INFORMATION CLAIM THEY DON'T

02:23:47.418 --> 02:23:49.387

02:23:49.454 --> 02:23:50.388
EITHER.

02:23:50.455 --> 02:23:52.824
COVERING JUST SAIL IS OBSOLETE

02:23:52.890 --> 02:23:54.692
OUT OF THE GATE.

02:23:54.759 --> 02:23:56.294
AND UNDERSTAND WHY WE MAKE MUST

02:23:56.361 --> 02:23:57.562
MAKE COMPANIES ASK OUR

02:23:57.628 --> 02:23:59.130
PERMISSION FROM THE START AND

02:23:59.197 --> 02:24:00.732
NOT MAKE IT OUR BURDEN TO OPT

02:24:00.798 --> 02:24:01.366
OUT.

02:24:01.432 --> 02:24:03.334
JUST IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT TRYING

02:24:03.401 --> 02:24:05.470
TO OPT OUT IF YOU DON'T ACTUALLY

02:24:05.536 --> 02:24:06.704
KNOW WHO HAS YOUR PERSONAL

02:24:06.771 --> 02:24:07.972

02:24:08.039 --> 02:24:09.440
DO YOU KNOW ALL THE COMPANIES

02:24:09.507 --> 02:24:10.908
WHO HAVE YOUR PERSONAL

02:24:10.975 --> 02:24:11.909
INFORMATION.

02:24:11.976 --> 02:24:14.445
HOW WILL YOU OPT OUT?

02:24:14.512 --> 02:24:16.014
AND EVEN IF WE KNOW SOME OF THE

02:24:16.080 --> 02:24:17.882
COMPANIES THEY HAVE VERY STRONG

02:24:17.949 --> 02:24:19.584
FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO MAKE IT

02:24:19.650 --> 02:24:21.152
AS DIFFICULT AS POSSIBLE FOR US

02:24:21.219 --> 02:24:23.121
TO OPT OUT.

02:24:23.187 --> 02:24:24.922
MR MAKE THAGARD SAID THAT IT

02:24:24.989 --> 02:24:26.524
SWITCHED FROM OFTEN OPT OUT FOR

02:24:26.591 --> 02:24:28.493
LEGAL REASONS BUT WE ARE THE

02:24:28.559 --> 02:24:30.828
ACLU WORK ON MORE CONSTITUTIONAL

02:24:30.895 --> 02:24:32.997
CASES ON BOTH PRIVACY AND FREE

02:24:33.064 --> 02:24:34.465
SPEECH THAN ANYONE ELSE.

02:24:34.532 --> 02:24:36.768
GOODNESS KNOWS WE HARDLY EVER

02:24:36.834 --> 02:24:39.203
STOP TALKING ABOUT FREE SPEECH.

02:24:39.270 --> 02:24:41.239
BUT THIS ARGUMENT DOES NOT HOLD

02:24:41.305 --> 02:24:43.341
WATER CALIFORNIANS OF ALL AGES

02:24:43.408 --> 02:24:44.876
HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO

02:24:44.942 --> 02:24:46.911

02:24:48.913 --> 02:24:49.614
GOOD.

02:24:49.680 --> 02:24:51.149
BUT THERE CAN AND SHOULD BE AN

02:24:51.215 --> 02:24:53.951
OPT IN FOR ALL PEOPLE.

02:24:54.018 --> 02:24:55.586
FINALLY REAL RIGHTS THAT ARE

02:24:55.653 --> 02:24:57.488
EQUAL FOR ALL AN ARE PROPERLY

02:24:57.555 --> 02:24:59.190
FOLLOWED BY COMPANIES THE RIGHT

02:24:59.257 --> 02:25:01.025
TO PRIVACY IS A CIVIL AND HUMAN

02:25:01.092 --> 02:25:03.327
RIGHT IS AN INALIENABLE RIGHT

02:25:03.394 --> 02:25:04.962
FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS.

02:25:05.029 --> 02:25:06.964
CCPA HAS A LOOPHOLE THAT MUST BE

02:25:07.031 --> 02:25:08.466
CLOSE TO MAKE SURE THERE CAN BE%

02:25:08.533 --> 02:25:10.068
NO DISCRIMINATION AND PEOPLE

02:25:10.134 --> 02:25:11.769
CANNOT BE PUNISHED WITH HIGHER

02:25:11.836 --> 02:25:14.072
PRICES OR DEGRADED SERVICE. FOR

02:25:14.138 --> 02:25:16.140

02:25:21.079 --> 02:25:22.313
BROADBAND PRIVACY.

02:25:22.380 --> 02:25:23.748
PEOPLE SHOULD BE IN CONTROL OF

02:25:23.815 --> 02:25:25.750
THEIR OWN PERSONAL DATA AND THAT

02:25:25.817 --> 02:25:27.785
PRIVACY SHOULD NOT BE A LUXURY

02:25:27.852 --> 02:25:29.353
RESERVED FOR THOSE WHO CAN

02:25:29.420 --> 02:25:30.788
AFFORD IT.

02:25:30.855 --> 02:25:32.223
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

02:25:32.290 --> 02:25:35.460
FINALLY PER ALL RIGHTS WE HAVE

02:25:35.526 --> 02:25:37.061

02:25:37.128 --> 02:25:38.496
ENFORCEABLE.

02:25:38.563 --> 02:25:40.198
AS THE AG HAS MADE CLEAR THERE

02:25:41.833 --> 02:25:42.834
OF ACTION.

02:25:42.900 --> 02:25:44.936
EVERY CALIFORNIAN MUST BE ABLE

02:25:45.002 --> 02:25:47.138
TO SEEK REDRESS IN COURT AGAINST

02:25:47.205 --> 02:25:48.673
COMPANIES THAT VIOLATE THE LAW

02:25:48.739 --> 02:25:50.908
JUST AS THEY CAN WITH ANY OTHER

IF UP IS NEVER BEEN SO BUSY IN

02:26:35.186 --> 02:26:36.154
OTHER STATES BEFORE AND THE

02:26:36.220 --> 02:26:37.588
REASONS REALLY SIMPLE PRIVACY IS

02:26:37.655 --> 02:26:39.056
A HUGE ISSUE FOR ORDINARY PEOPLE

02:26:39.123 --> 02:26:39.490
TODAY.

02:26:39.557 --> 02:26:41.659
PUBLIC OFFICIALS ACROSS THE

02:26:41.726 --> 02:26:42.593
COUNTRY GET IT.

02:26:42.660 --> 02:26:44.395
AND THEY KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA'S

02:26:44.462 --> 02:26:46.464
LEADING THE FIGHT.

02:26:46.531 --> 02:26:48.366
NOW INDUSTRY ALSO SAT UP AND

02:26:48.432 --> 02:26:50.301
STARTED AYING ATTENTION WHEN

02:26:50.368 --> 02:26:51.602
THE CCPA CAME ON THE SCENE.

02:26:51.669 --> 02:26:53.070
YOU KNOW IT WAS AND IS AN

02:26:53.137 --> 02:26:54.372
IMPORTANT STEP.

02:26:54.438 --> 02:26:56.774
TOWARD TRULY IMPLEMENTING OUR

02:26:56.841 --> 02:26:58.309
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT OF PRIVACY.

02:26:58.376 --> 02:26:59.710
ABOUT RIGHTS DON'T PROTECT

02:26:59.777 --> 02:27:01.712
THEMSELVES AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE

02:27:01.779 --> 02:27:03.047
HERE AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE

02:27:03.114 --> 02:27:04.382
ACTUALLY GOING TO BE HERE BROKE

02:27:04.448 --> 02:27:07.385
FOR MANY YEARS TO COME AS WE GET

02:27:07.451 --> 02:27:08.786
BETTER AND BETTER AT THIS.

02:27:08.853 --> 02:27:10.254
I WANTED TO ADDRESS A COUPLE OF

02:27:10.321 --> 02:27:13.991
THE POINTS OF THE IN SOME OF THE

02:27:14.058 --> 02:27:16.027
EARLIER --

02:27:16.093 --> 02:27:17.628
COMMENTS YOU KNOW ONE OF THE

02:27:17.695 --> 02:27:18.763
THINGS I THINK THAT'S GOING TO

02:27:18.829 --> 02:27:19.764
BE REALLY IMPORTANT IN THIS

02:27:19.830 --> 02:27:21.666
AREAS DEALING WITH --

02:27:21.732 --> 02:27:24.202
THE ISSUE OF THE ADVERTISING

02:27:24.268 --> 02:27:26.704
INDUSTRY AND ITS BUSINESS MODEL --

02:27:26.771 --> 02:27:28.139
BUT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS

02:27:28.206 --> 02:27:30.208
THAT THAT WAS THAT I FOUND

02:27:30.274 --> 02:27:31.242
INTERESTING LISTENING TO THE

02:27:31.309 --> 02:27:32.877
EARLIER PANEL WAS THAT.

02:27:32.944 --> 02:27:34.345
YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE.

02:27:34.412 --> 02:27:36.714
BEGINNING TO SAY NICE THINGS OR

02:27:36.781 --> 02:27:38.950
SAYING NICE THINGS ABOUT THE GPR

02:27:39.016 --> 02:27:40.718
AT THE SAME TIME ABSORB

02:27:40.785 --> 02:27:43.387
CRITICIZING THE CCPA.

02:27:43.454 --> 02:27:45.122
AND YET WHEN YOU LOOK AT ON AN

02:27:45.189 --> 02:27:47.191
AREA LIKE ADVERTISING AS A

02:27:47.258 --> 02:27:48.826
BUSINESS MODEL YOU SEE THAT THE

02:27:48.893 --> 02:27:51.996
GPR IS ACTUALLY RIGHT NOW --

02:27:52.063 --> 02:27:53.464
YOU KNOW REALLY PUTTING THAT

02:27:53.531 --> 02:27:56.033
ADVERTISING MODEL IN UNDER A LOT

02:27:56.100 --> 02:27:57.668
OF STRESS --

02:27:57.735 --> 02:27:59.870
AND THIS IS THE A BIG CHANGE I

02:27:59.937 --> 02:28:02.974
MEAN IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN YOU

02:28:03.040 --> 02:28:05.009
KNOW WE SAW A FRENCH REGULATOR

02:28:05.076 --> 02:28:06.310
THE NEIL --

02:28:06.377 --> 02:28:09.480
IMPOSE UP FINDS ON ON GOOGLE FOR

02:28:09.547 --> 02:28:10.348
VIOLATIONS I THINK IT WAS

02:28:10.414 --> 02:28:13.551
FACEBOOK A HUNDRED AND FIFTY

02:28:13.618 --> 02:28:15.419
THOUSAND EUROS.

02:28:15.486 --> 02:28:16.854
YOU KNOW NOW WE'RE SEEING YOU

02:28:16.921 --> 02:28:19.257
KNOW POTENTIALLY EIGHT FIGURE

02:28:19.323 --> 02:28:21.492
FINDS UNDER GPR THAT IS REALLY.

02:28:21.559 --> 02:28:22.426
WHAT IS GETTING THEM TO TAKE

02:28:22.493 --> 02:28:23.327
NOTICE --

02:28:23.394 --> 02:28:24.829
THERE WAS A RECENT MUCH MORE

02:28:24.895 --> 02:28:27.732
RECENT UP FINDING AGAINST A A

02:28:27.798 --> 02:28:29.667
COMPANY YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF

02:28:29.734 --> 02:28:31.969
AND I'D NEVER HEARD OF VICTORIA --

02:28:32.036 --> 02:28:34.572
WHERE THERE WAS AN ISSUE ABOUT

02:28:34.639 --> 02:28:35.906
WHETHER OR NOT THEY COULD

02:28:35.973 --> 02:28:38.676
DEMONSTRATE THAT CONSENT HAD

02:28:38.743 --> 02:28:40.544
ACTUALLY BEEN --

02:28:40.611 --> 02:28:44.682
OBTAINED WHO THEY WERE --

02:28:44.749 --> 02:28:45.983
WHOSE PERSONAL INFORMATION THEY

02:28:46.050 --> 02:28:47.018
WERE SENDING OUT.

02:28:47.084 --> 02:28:50.154
AS PART OF THE ADVERTISING

02:28:50.221 --> 02:28:51.689
INDUSTRY SORT OF REAL TIME

02:28:51.756 --> 02:28:53.457
BIDDING EXCHANGE.

02:28:53.524 --> 02:28:56.093
SO WE WE DON'T SEE HOW WHETHER

02:28:56.160 --> 02:28:57.828
YOU CALL IT SALES.

02:28:57.895 --> 02:28:59.497
OR SHARING --

02:28:59.563 --> 02:29:02.199
AND WHY THAT SHOULD MAKE A

02:29:02.266 --> 02:29:05.102
DIFFERENCE WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING

02:29:05.169 --> 02:29:07.104
AT THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THIS

02:29:07.171 --> 02:29:08.439
PERSONAL INFORMATION BEING

02:29:08.506 --> 02:29:10.174
SHARED AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT

02:29:10.241 --> 02:29:10.675
SEEING THAT.

02:29:10.741 --> 02:29:13.110
THE GPR AUTHORITIES ARE GOING TO

02:29:13.177 --> 02:29:15.813
ARE GOING TO BE A SPECIALLY FOR

02:29:15.880 --> 02:29:17.081
GIVING ABOUT THAT.

02:29:17.148 --> 02:29:18.582
BUT THERE WAS ALSO AN ISSUE

02:29:18.649 --> 02:29:19.583
WE'VE SEEN.

02:29:19.650 --> 02:29:22.286
ABOUT THE DEFINITION OF CONSUMER

02:29:22.353 --> 02:29:24.755
A ONE ON ONE POINT I WANTED TO

02:29:24.822 --> 02:29:25.790
MAKE ABOUT THAT WAS.

02:29:25.856 --> 02:29:27.291
THERE SEEM TO BE A CONCERN THAT

02:29:27.358 --> 02:29:28.793
WHILE YOU MIGHT NOT BE A

02:29:28.859 --> 02:29:30.828
CONSUMER OF THIS PARTICULAR

02:29:30.895 --> 02:29:33.764
COMPANY YOU MIGHT HAVE A

02:29:33.831 --> 02:29:35.933
BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM --

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:37.335
BUT IN FACT THAT'S PART OF THE

02:29:37.401 --> 02:29:39.303
PROBLEM THAT'S PART OF THE POINT

02:29:39.370 --> 02:29:40.971
RIGHT ON YOUR INFORMATION

02:29:41.038 --> 02:29:43.040
TRAVELS FROM THE COMPANIES YOU

02:29:43.107 --> 02:29:44.975
DO KNOW ABOUT. TO THE COMPANIES

02:29:45.042 --> 02:29:46.577
YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT --

02:29:46.644 --> 02:29:49.447
AND AT THAT POINT --

02:29:49.513 --> 02:29:50.781
UNDER EXISTING LOTS OF VERY VERY

02:29:50.848 --> 02:29:53.684
HARD TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND

02:29:53.751 --> 02:29:55.553
INDEED.

02:29:55.619 --> 02:29:57.655
WELL THE FACT THAT --

02:29:57.722 --> 02:29:59.824
YOU KNOW AS NICK IS THAT.

02:29:59.890 --> 02:30:02.159
THE HOW CAN YOU DO ANYTHING TO

02:30:02.226 --> 02:30:03.394
SAY OPT OUT OF THE SALE THAT

02:30:03.461 --> 02:30:05.796
INFORMATION IF YOU DON'T KNOW.

02:30:05.863 --> 02:30:07.331
WHO THEY ARE AND THIS IS A

02:30:07.398 --> 02:30:09.667
PROBLEM I SEE IN THE ADVERTISING

02:30:09.734 --> 02:30:11.202
INDUSTRY IS ALSO A PROBLEM WITH

02:30:11.268 --> 02:30:13.771
SOME UP FAMILIAR LARGE ACTORS

02:30:13.838 --> 02:30:15.506
LIKE DATA BROKERS --

02:30:15.573 --> 02:30:18.109
LIKE EXPERIENCE LIKE EQUIFAX YOU

02:30:18.175 --> 02:30:19.777
KNOW WE ARE GENERALLY NOT.

02:30:19.844 --> 02:30:21.512
CUSTOMERS OF THEM THEIR

02:30:21.579 --> 02:30:23.647
CUSTOMERS AND THEIR CLIENTS ARE

02:30:23.714 --> 02:30:25.816
OTHER BUSINESSES --

02:30:25.883 --> 02:30:29.453
FOR THEM OUR DATA IS SIMPLY --

02:30:29.520 --> 02:30:30.254
FOR US TO BE ABLE TO HAVE

02:30:30.321 --> 02:30:32.656
CONTROL OVER THEM IT'S AND IT

02:30:32.723 --> 02:30:34.258
CAN'T BE POSSIBLE --

02:30:34.325 --> 02:30:35.726
YOU SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO LIMIT

02:30:35.793 --> 02:30:38.028
THE CONSUMER RELATIONSHIP TO

02:30:38.095 --> 02:30:39.563
JUST SOMEONE WAS A DIRECT.

02:30:39.630 --> 02:30:40.331
FACE TO FACE RELATIONSHIP WITH

02:30:40.398 --> 02:30:43.134
THE COMPANY.

02:30:43.200 --> 02:30:45.269
ANOTHER ISSUE THAT THE THAT

02:30:45.336 --> 02:30:46.904
WE'VE DISCUSSED THIS QUESTION OF

02:30:46.971 --> 02:30:50.674
OF OCT IN VERSUS OPT OUT AND

02:30:50.741 --> 02:30:51.909
MAKE YOU ALREADY ADDRESSED THIS

02:30:51.976 --> 02:30:53.411
TO SOME EXTENT BUT YOU KNOW WE

02:30:53.477 --> 02:30:55.713
WOULD LIKE TO AGREE THAT.

02:30:55.780 --> 02:30:58.182
YOU KNOW WE DON'T THINK THAT THE

02:30:58.249 --> 02:31:00.184
FIRST AMENDMENT DRAWS THIS

02:31:00.251 --> 02:31:01.852
INCREDIBLY BRIGHT LINE.

02:31:01.919 --> 02:31:04.855
BETWEEN OPT IN AN OPT OUT --

02:31:04.922 --> 02:31:06.590
YOU KNOW WE HAVE WE ARE ALSO

02:31:06.657 --> 02:31:08.592
LOOKING VERY MUCH AT WE SPEECH

02:31:08.659 --> 02:31:10.327
RIGHTS WE BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW

02:31:10.394 --> 02:31:11.362
FREE SPEECH IS SOMETHING THAT IS

02:31:11.429 --> 02:31:12.730
ENJOYED.

02:31:12.797 --> 02:31:18.302
BY ALL SORTS OF ENTITIES UP BUT

02:31:18.369 --> 02:31:21.071
IT IS IT IS A NOT SO SIMPLE AS

02:31:21.138 --> 02:31:22.406
OPT OUT IS OKAY.

02:31:22.473 --> 02:31:24.875
OFTEN IS NOT --

02:31:24.942 --> 02:31:26.477
ONE OF THE LEADING CASES FOR

02:31:26.544 --> 02:31:26.777
INSTANCE --

02:31:26.844 --> 02:31:30.748
SO ROUTE WHICH AS A SUPPORT FOR

02:31:30.815 --> 02:31:31.549
THE IDEA THAT --

02:31:31.615 --> 02:31:33.317
YOU CAN'T HAVE OFTEN.

02:31:33.384 --> 02:31:34.652
I THINK THAT'S A VERY VERY

02:31:34.718 --> 02:31:36.787
DISTINGUISHABLE CASE --

02:31:36.854 --> 02:31:38.956
IT IS IT DEALT WITH THE SALE OF

02:31:39.023 --> 02:31:40.491
CERTAIN KINDS OF PRESCRIBING

02:31:40.558 --> 02:31:42.526
INFORMATION IT WAS NOT EVEN TIED

02:31:42.593 --> 02:31:45.596
DIRECTLY. TO THE INTERESTS OF

02:31:45.663 --> 02:31:48.032
THE PATIENTS IN PRIVACY AND BACK

02:31:48.098 --> 02:31:49.166
WHEN IT WAS REALLY THE SPRING

02:31:49.233 --> 02:31:50.668
COURT WAS LOOKING AT QUESTIONS

02:31:50.734 --> 02:31:52.903
OF WHETHER THE PRESCRIBERS --

02:31:52.970 --> 02:31:54.505
SHOULD HAVE PRIVACY SO I THINK

02:31:54.572 --> 02:31:55.806
THAT -- YOU

02:31:55.873 --> 02:31:57.408
YOU CAN'T REALLY ALIGNED ON

02:31:57.475 --> 02:31:59.076
THOSE KINDS OF CASES BUT YOU'RE

02:31:59.143 --> 02:32:01.846
THINKING ABOUT THIS.

02:32:01.912 --> 02:32:03.647
I'M YOU KNOW THE BIGGER QUESTION.

02:32:03.714 --> 02:32:04.281
IS.

02:32:04.348 --> 02:32:06.717
WHO HAS THE BURDEN?

02:32:06.784 --> 02:32:09.720
ALL WHO IS BEARING THE COSTS.

02:32:09.787 --> 02:32:11.222
OF WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

02:32:11.288 --> 02:32:12.990
CONSENT OPT IN OPT OUT --

02:32:13.057 --> 02:32:16.093
BECAUSE NUMEROUS STUDIES HAVE

02:32:16.160 --> 02:32:20.498
SHOWN THAT THE CONSUMER.

02:32:20.564 --> 02:32:23.734
IN ORDER TO GET OUT.

02:32:23.801 --> 02:32:26.003
ACTUALLY INFORM THEMSELVES PAST

02:32:26.070 --> 02:32:27.638
DUE IN NORMAN WOULD HAVE TO DO

02:32:27.705 --> 02:32:29.240
AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT BEHAVIORAL

02:32:29.306 --> 02:32:30.341
ECONOMICS IS FULL OF STUDIES

02:32:30.407 --> 02:32:31.375
THAT TALK ABOUT.

02:32:31.442 --> 02:32:32.877
HOW MANY HOURS WOULD TAKE TO

02:32:32.943 --> 02:32:35.813
READ PRIVACY NOTICES CENTER IT'S

02:32:35.880 --> 02:32:37.481
SORT OF THE NOSE AND CHOICE

02:32:37.548 --> 02:32:40.117
MODEL IN THAT SORT OF PLANT?

02:32:40.184 --> 02:32:41.452
HAS A PROBLEM BECAUSE IT PUTS

02:32:41.519 --> 02:32:42.019
TOO MUCH OF A BURDEN ON THE

02:32:42.086 --> 02:32:43.621
INDIVIDUAL AND NOT ENOUGH ON THE

02:32:43.687 --> 02:32:45.422
COMPANIES WHO ARE IN FACT.

02:32:45.489 --> 02:32:47.391
THE ONES THAT KNOW WILL --

02:32:47.458 --> 02:32:48.792
WHERE AT WHAT IS HAPPENING TO

02:32:48.859 --> 02:32:49.927
OUR INFORMATION AND WHERE IT

02:32:49.994 --> 02:32:50.427
GOES?

02:32:50.494 --> 02:32:54.231
INDEED THEY MAY ALSO BE THE ONLY

02:32:54.298 --> 02:32:58.502
ONES UNDER FORMS THAT THAT SEES

02:32:58.569 --> 02:33:00.037
A STARTED --

02:33:00.104 --> 02:33:01.906
AND THAT WE WANT MORE OF RENTS

02:33:01.972 --> 02:33:03.407
SINCE -- I

02:33:03.474 --> 02:33:05.409
DON'T THINK THE CHAMBER UP THE

02:33:05.476 --> 02:33:07.478
LAST LETTER I THINK IN AUGUST

02:33:07.545 --> 02:33:09.013
THE THE CHAMBER WAS NOT

02:33:09.079 --> 02:33:10.147
SUPPORTIVE.

02:33:10.214 --> 02:33:12.683
OF THE IDEA OF SPECIFIC PIECES

02:33:12.750 --> 02:33:14.952
OF INFORMATION BEING GIVEN OUT --

02:33:15.019 --> 02:33:16.520
AND YET.

02:33:16.587 --> 02:33:17.254
THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE

02:33:17.321 --> 02:33:19.456
BETWEEN KNOWING THAT --

02:33:19.523 --> 02:33:20.691
SOMEONE A SHARED YOUR BROWSING

02:33:20.758 --> 02:33:21.792
HISTORY --

02:33:21.859 --> 02:33:23.260
AND ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO SEE

02:33:23.327 --> 02:33:24.862
THE BROWSING HISTORY THAT THEY

02:33:24.929 --> 02:33:28.332
SHARE A MOCK MY MOTHER.

02:33:28.399 --> 02:33:31.035
HAS NO CONCEPT OF WHAT FOR

02:33:31.101 --> 02:33:34.171
BROWSING HISTORY CONTENT --

02:33:34.238 --> 02:33:36.373
MOST PEOPLE DON'T THEY DON'T

02:33:36.440 --> 02:33:37.841
KNOW THAT LOCATION AND SHARED

02:33:37.908 --> 02:33:39.076
THEY DON'T KNOW THAT ALL SORTS

02:33:39.143 --> 02:33:41.111
OF OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT USE

02:33:41.178 --> 02:33:42.813
WHAT IS ACTUALLY AND THAT IT AND

02:33:42.880 --> 02:33:44.815
THE CLICK STREAM --

02:33:44.882 --> 02:33:45.783
UP FURTHER MORE --

02:33:45.849 --> 02:33:46.350
I THINK THE CHAMBERS HAVE

02:33:46.417 --> 02:33:48.018
PROBLEMS WITH THE INCLUSION OF

02:33:48.085 --> 02:33:50.788
THE CONCEPT OF INFERENCES AS

02:33:50.854 --> 02:33:52.156
SOMETHING THAT THE COMPANY WOULD

02:33:52.222 --> 02:33:53.057
HAVE TO SHARE.

02:33:53.123 --> 02:33:55.059
AND YET I THINK MANY OF US WILL

02:33:55.125 --> 02:33:56.093
REMEMBER --

02:33:56.160 --> 02:33:57.995
BEING SURPRISED WHEN --

02:33:58.062 --> 02:33:59.897
THE NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE DID

02:33:59.964 --> 02:34:01.632
AN ARTICLE SEVERAL YEARS AGO

02:34:01.699 --> 02:34:02.266
ABOUT HOW --

02:34:02.333 --> 02:34:06.036
TARGET WAS ABLE TO CONSTRUCT.

02:34:06.103 --> 02:34:08.205
A PREGNANCY ASSESSMENT BASED ON

02:34:08.272 --> 02:34:10.808
THE KINDS OF GOODS THAT PEOPLE

02:34:10.874 --> 02:34:13.777
WERE BUYING IT WERE ABLE TO

02:34:13.844 --> 02:34:15.646
ACTUALLY IDENTIFY WITH SOME

02:34:15.713 --> 02:34:16.947
DEGREE OF ACCURACY --

02:34:17.014 --> 02:34:19.249
WHEN A WOMAN WAS IN HER SECOND

02:34:19.316 --> 02:34:20.584
TRIMESTER OF PREGNANCY?

02:34:20.651 --> 02:34:21.752
NOW.

02:34:21.819 --> 02:34:23.053
IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT WAS

02:34:23.120 --> 02:34:24.788
POSSIBLE YOU WOULD NEVER

02:34:24.855 --> 02:34:26.357
UNDERSTAND.

02:34:26.423 --> 02:34:28.359
WHAT TARGET Y. TIGHT WITH

02:34:28.425 --> 02:34:30.260
INTERESTED IN THAT INFORMATION

02:34:30.327 --> 02:34:32.196
YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND HOW WAS

02:34:32.262 --> 02:34:33.731
BEING USED AND YOU WILL

02:34:33.797 --> 02:34:35.733
UNDERSTAND THE THREAT THAT

02:34:35.799 --> 02:34:37.334
PERSONAL INFORMATION EVEN WHEN

02:34:37.401 --> 02:34:39.870
IT SEEMS VERY INNOCUOUS --

02:34:39.937 --> 02:34:41.705
CAN BE IN THE HANDS OF LARGE

02:34:41.772 --> 02:34:43.741
COMPANIES THAT HAVE A LOT OF OF

02:34:43.807 --> 02:34:46.443
DATA MINING ABILITY --

02:34:46.510 --> 02:34:47.611
SO WE THINK THAT.

02:34:47.678 --> 02:34:49.980
FROM A CONSUMER STANDPOINT --

02:34:50.047 --> 02:34:50.814
FROM THE STANDPOINT OF ACTUALLY

02:34:50.881 --> 02:34:53.651
BEING ABLE TO PROTECT OURSELVES --

02:34:53.717 --> 02:34:55.519
FOR BEING ABLE TO COLLECTIVELY

02:34:55.586 --> 02:34:56.553
UNDERSTAND --

02:34:56.620 --> 02:34:58.288
THE THREAT TO PRIVACY THE

02:34:58.355 --> 02:34:59.857
COMPANIES START POSING IT WE

02:34:59.923 --> 02:35:02.226
REALLY NEED TO HAVE OF THESE

02:35:02.292 --> 02:35:05.596
KINDS OF OF PROTECTION.

02:35:05.663 --> 02:35:08.699
NOW I ALSO WANTED TO GO TO THE

02:35:08.766 --> 02:35:10.334
QUESTION WHAT FORCE MEANT --

02:35:10.401 --> 02:35:12.269
AND AGAIN VERY SIMPLE WE SUPPORT

02:35:12.336 --> 02:35:13.537
STRONGLY --

02:35:13.604 --> 02:35:15.539
THE NOTION THAT THERE SHOULD BE

02:35:15.606 --> 02:35:17.641
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION --

02:35:17.708 --> 02:35:20.711
IN THE CCPA --

02:35:20.778 --> 02:35:22.446
YOUNG WE AGREE WITH THE AG THAT

02:35:22.513 --> 02:35:24.248
EXPANDING PRIVATE RIGHT OF

02:35:24.314 --> 02:35:25.716
ACTION MAKES SENSE --

02:35:25.783 --> 02:35:27.618
IN FACT MANY PRIVACY STATUTES

02:35:27.685 --> 02:35:31.321
RIGHT NOW CAN LAWS ON WIRE TAPS

02:35:31.388 --> 02:35:33.557
STORED ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS.

02:35:33.624 --> 02:35:35.759
VIDEO RENTALS DRIVER'S LICENSES

02:35:35.826 --> 02:35:37.528
AND SO ON AND SO DO MANY OTHER

02:35:37.594 --> 02:35:38.796
KINDS OF LAWS.

02:35:38.862 --> 02:35:40.197
THAT PROTECT THE PUBLIC FEDERAL

02:35:40.264 --> 02:35:41.732
LAWS ON CLEAN WATER.

02:35:41.799 --> 02:35:43.801
EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION ACCESS

02:35:43.867 --> 02:35:45.669
TO RECORDS.

02:35:45.736 --> 02:35:48.205
ALSO YOU KNOW AGENCIES

02:35:48.272 --> 02:35:49.707
THEMSELVES --

02:35:49.773 --> 02:35:51.575
EVEN THOUGH WE WE LOVE THE

02:35:51.642 --> 02:35:53.177
AGENT'S OFFICE BEING IN.

02:35:53.243 --> 02:35:55.979
CHARGE OF OF THE PRIVACY

02:35:56.046 --> 02:35:58.182
REGULATION HERE AT THE SAME TIME

02:35:58.248 --> 02:35:59.950
WE'VE ALSO HEARD THAT THEY HAVE

02:36:00.017 --> 02:36:01.618
A RESOURCE ISSUE --

02:36:01.685 --> 02:36:04.188
AND YOU KNOW THE FTC ITSELF YOU

02:36:04.254 --> 02:36:06.323
SEE DURING THE RECENT SHUT DOWN

02:36:06.390 --> 02:36:08.192
DOT PUT PAS.

02:36:08.258 --> 02:36:12.496
ON THEIR ATTEMPTS --

02:36:12.563 --> 02:36:15.132
TO TO SANCTION OF FACEBOOK.

02:36:15.199 --> 02:36:16.033
THERE IS AN INHERENT RISK MORE

02:36:16.100 --> 02:36:17.968
OVER A REGULATORY CAPTURE --

02:36:18.035 --> 02:36:19.570
WHEN YOU HAVE AN FORTUNATE

02:36:19.636 --> 02:36:20.971
CENTRALIZED?

02:36:21.038 --> 02:36:22.673
NOW ONE OF THE DIFFERENT THINGS

02:36:22.740 --> 02:36:24.975
WE SEEN GPR IS INCREDIBLY

02:36:25.042 --> 02:36:27.311
DECENTRALIZED REPORTING SYSTEM.

02:36:27.377 --> 02:36:30.481
NOT ONLY DPA SAID EVERY EVERY

02:36:30.547 --> 02:36:34.618
OTHER COUNTRY AND HOMBURG

02:36:34.685 --> 02:36:36.453
GERMANY DOES HAS ITS OWN DEEP

02:36:36.520 --> 02:36:38.222
YET -- SO

02:36:38.288 --> 02:36:39.256
THERE IS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF

02:36:39.323 --> 02:36:41.658
ENFORCEMENT POSSIBILITY THAT

02:36:41.725 --> 02:36:44.027
WE'RE GONNA SEE UNDER JEEP GPR

02:36:44.094 --> 02:36:45.229
AND MANY OF THE LARGEST

02:36:45.295 --> 02:36:46.430
COMPANIES HERE ARE ACTUALLY

02:36:46.497 --> 02:36:47.698
GOING TO BE --

02:36:47.765 --> 02:36:49.500
YOU KNOW IN THE CROSS HAIRS OF

02:36:49.566 --> 02:36:50.768
THOSE ALREADY AND WAS QUITE

BEING REQUIRED. TO COMPLY.

02:36:54.671 --> 02:36:55.906

02:36:55.973 --> 02:36:58.308
RIGHT OF ACTION WE'RE GOING TO

02:36:58.375 --> 02:37:00.511
INCREASE SORT OF THE PORTFOLIO

JUST BE ONE INCENTIVE THEY'LL BE

02:37:04.281 --> 02:37:04.882

INCENTIVES --

02:37:06.617 --> 02:37:08.252
AND THIS IS GOING TO PUT MORE

02:37:08.318 --> 02:37:09.853
PRESSURE ON THE COMPANIES TO BE

02:37:09.920 --> 02:37:12.256
ACCOUNTABLE UP FROM THE PRIVACY

02:37:12.322 --> 02:37:13.957

THE CURRENT LAW --

02:37:22.666 --> 02:37:24.101

02:37:24.168 --> 02:37:25.803
CONTROL OVER WHAT COMPANIES ARE

02:37:25.869 --> 02:37:27.671

SO NOT START WITH A COUPLE OF

EXAMPLES SO LET'S SUPPOSE YOUR

02:42:31.274 --> 02:42:33.243
USER OF GOOGLE MAPS.

02:42:33.310 --> 02:42:34.644
AND YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO GIVE

02:42:34.711 --> 02:42:36.213
GOOGLE MAPS ACCESS TO YOUR

02:42:36.279 --> 02:42:38.415

02:42:51.995 --> 02:42:53.763
SO COMPLETELY REASONABLE CHOICE

02:42:53.830 --> 02:42:55.132
A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD HAVE

02:42:55.198 --> 02:42:56.933
SECOND EXAMPLE --

02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:59.769

THE CONTENT BACK TO YOU.

02:43:07.844 --> 02:43:09.312
IT MAY VERY WELL BE THAT YOU

02:43:09.379 --> 02:43:11.481
DON'T WANT THEM OR EXPECT THEM

02:43:11.548 --> 02:43:13.150
TO USE IT. TO DO ADVERTISING

02:43:13.216 --> 02:43:15.218
THAT YOU SEE IS COMPLETELY

02:43:15.285 --> 02:43:17.187
UNRELATED TO THE SERVICE TO

LOOK AT IT GENERALLY IS A TRADE

02:43:24.861 --> 02:43:25.896

02:43:25.962 --> 02:43:28.832
ACCESS TO CERTAIN OUT OF MY

02:43:28.899 --> 02:43:31.701
PERSONAL INFORMATION WE'RE

02:43:31.768 --> 02:43:32.469
REALLY FACING HIM WE'VE BEEN

02:43:32.536 --> 02:43:33.436
FACING.

02:43:33.503 --> 02:43:36.072
ON THIS ALL ALONG.

02:43:36.139 --> 02:43:37.607
ONE OR USERS OFFERED MEANINGFUL

02:43:37.674 --> 02:43:39.142
CHOICES CAN THEY EXERCISE

02:43:39.209 --> 02:43:41.478
MEANINGFUL CHOICES OVER HOW MUCH

02:43:41.545 --> 02:43:42.712
OF MY INFORMATION WHAT

02:43:42.779 --> 02:43:44.347
FUNCTIONALLY DO I GUESS.

02:43:44.414 --> 02:43:45.682
AND SECOND TO THE AT THE

02:43:45.749 --> 02:43:46.316
INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED TO

02:43:46.383 --> 02:43:47.083
DECIDE.

02:43:47.150 --> 02:43:49.219
SO WHAT I WANT TO DO IS I WANT

02:43:49.286 --> 02:43:50.520
TO VISIT THOSE AND SUGGEST A

02:43:50.587 --> 02:43:52.322
COUPLE OF REFINEMENTS.

02:43:52.389 --> 02:43:54.024
SO MANY START WITH USER CHOICE.

02:43:54.090 --> 02:43:56.493
SO WE LOOK AT IT IS ESSENTIALLY

02:43:56.560 --> 02:43:57.661
THREE BUCKETS AND PEOPLE BEEN

02:43:57.727 --> 02:43:59.329
TALKING ABOUT IT BUT I JUST WANT.

02:43:59.396 --> 02:44:00.630
TO ADD A LITTLE BIT OF INSIGHT

02:44:00.697 --> 02:44:04.100
TO IT SO ONE BUCKET IS TERMS AND

02:44:04.167 --> 02:44:05.769
CONDITIONS.

02:44:05.835 --> 02:44:06.736
YOU HAVE TO AGREE TO A USE THE

02:44:06.803 --> 02:44:08.371
SERVICE THE SECOND ONE IS OPT

02:44:08.438 --> 02:44:09.973
OUT THE DEFAULT IS THEY CAN USE

02:44:10.040 --> 02:44:11.074
IT BUT YOU CAN EXERCISE THE

02:44:11.141 --> 02:44:12.075
CHOICE NOT.

02:44:12.142 --> 02:44:13.944
TO THE THIRD ONE OUT TO THE

02:44:14.010 --> 02:44:15.111
PEOPLE OF IN TALKING ABOUT.

02:44:15.178 --> 02:44:16.913
SO THE QUESTION THE WORLD FACING

02:44:16.980 --> 02:44:18.081
THE TEACHER STRUGGLING WITH THIS

02:44:18.148 --> 02:44:19.416
WHICH BUCKETS APPROPRIATE FOR

02:44:19.482 --> 02:44:20.550
WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION.

02:44:20.617 --> 02:44:22.352
SO LET ME BRING IN WHAT WE KNOW

02:44:22.419 --> 02:44:25.589
FROM RESEARCH SO WHAT WE KNOW IS

02:44:25.655 --> 02:44:27.023
THAT USE YOUR EXPECTATIONS

02:44:27.090 --> 02:44:28.491
DEPEND VERY MUCH IN THE CONTEXT

02:44:28.558 --> 02:44:31.661
WHY WAS I GIVEN THIS INFORMATION

02:44:31.728 --> 02:44:33.496
WHAT IS GOING TO BE USED.

02:44:33.563 --> 02:44:34.264
FOR SO WHEN DATE IS USED IN

02:44:34.331 --> 02:44:35.332
CONTEXT PARTICULARLY IT'S

02:44:35.398 --> 02:44:37.434
REQUIRED TO OPERATE THE SERVICE.

02:44:37.500 --> 02:44:39.869
THEN IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE THAT

02:44:39.936 --> 02:44:41.504
IS IN THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS

02:44:41.571 --> 02:44:44.040
ARE IS AN OPT OUT IT'LL COME

02:44:44.107 --> 02:44:44.674
BACK TO THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN

02:44:44.741 --> 02:44:45.108
THOSE.

02:44:45.175 --> 02:44:47.043
BUT THEN THE RESEARCH SAYS IF

02:44:47.110 --> 02:44:47.777
THE INFORMATION IS BEING USED

02:44:47.844 --> 02:44:48.912
OUT OF CONTEXT.

02:44:48.979 --> 02:44:50.447
THE USER WANTS TO BE ABLE TO

02:44:50.513 --> 02:44:53.850
MAKE THAT TO SEE THE DECISION A

02:44:53.917 --> 02:44:55.385
NEW MEANS.

02:44:55.452 --> 02:44:56.786
I KNEW.

02:44:56.853 --> 02:44:58.388
TAKING A LOOK AT WHAT

02:44:58.455 --> 02:45:00.023
INFORMATION OF A PROVIDING AND

02:45:00.090 --> 02:45:01.625
WHEN I GET BORED.

02:45:01.691 --> 02:45:03.493
AND THAT TRANSLATES TALKED AND

02:45:03.560 --> 02:45:04.694
SO WHATEVER COURAGE YOU IN

02:45:04.761 --> 02:45:05.528
LOOKING AT THESE DEBATES THAT

02:45:05.595 --> 02:45:06.596
YOU'VE BEEN HEARING ALL DAY

02:45:06.663 --> 02:45:08.198
TODAY ON OFTEN VERSUS OPT OUT

02:45:08.265 --> 02:45:09.633
VERSUS TERMS CONDITIONS. TO LOOK

02:45:09.699 --> 02:45:11.601
AT IT IN THAT WAY IT'S WHAT WITH

02:45:11.668 --> 02:45:13.036
THE USER EXPECTATION BE IN

02:45:13.103 --> 02:45:15.772
CONTEXT SO A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES.

02:45:15.839 --> 02:45:17.274
SO LET'S GO BACK TO THE I SP

02:45:17.340 --> 02:45:19.643
EXAMPLE THEY NEED TO LOOK AT

02:45:19.709 --> 02:45:20.543
WHERE I WANT TO GO ON THE

02:45:20.610 --> 02:45:22.245
INTERNET IP ADDRESSES TO GET ME

02:45:22.312 --> 02:45:22.979
THERE.

02:45:23.046 --> 02:45:24.481
THAT'S PART OF THE SERVICE THEY

02:45:24.547 --> 02:45:26.049
CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT IT VERY

02:45:26.116 --> 02:45:27.817
NATURALLY I HAVE AGREED TO THAT

02:45:27.884 --> 02:45:31.988
IN THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

02:45:32.055 --> 02:45:33.156
THAT'S WHAT I'M PAYING THEM.

02:45:33.223 --> 02:45:35.358
FOR BUT IF THEY WANT TO USE IT

02:45:35.425 --> 02:45:36.793
FOR BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISING THAT

02:45:36.860 --> 02:45:37.894
SHOULD BE A NEW DECISION.

02:45:37.961 --> 02:45:39.562
THAT SHOULD BE OFTEN I CAN MAKE

02:45:39.629 --> 02:45:41.131
THAT DECISION I LIKE THE RIVER

02:45:41.197 --> 02:45:42.265
LABORATORIES AND OR I DON'T

02:45:42.332 --> 02:45:43.233
PEOPLE DISAGREE ON THAT.

02:45:43.300 --> 02:45:43.867
BUT THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE

02:45:43.933 --> 02:45:45.835
THAT DECISION SO WHAT DOES HE

02:45:45.902 --> 02:45:47.237
CPA SAY ABOUT THIS.

02:45:47.304 --> 02:45:49.539
SO WHAT IT SAYS IS IT'S AS IF

02:45:49.606 --> 02:45:51.574
IT'S A BUSINESS PURPOSE OR DE

02:45:51.641 --> 02:45:53.343
IDENTIFIED.

02:45:53.410 --> 02:45:54.544
THEN IT'S PART OF TERMS

02:45:54.611 --> 02:45:56.446
CONDITIONS MAKES PERFECT SENSE.

02:45:56.513 --> 02:45:57.380
AND THEN IT SAYS IT'S NOT A

02:45:57.447 --> 02:45:59.249
BUSINESS PURPOSE AND IT'S

02:45:59.316 --> 02:46:01.618
IDENTIFIABLE PI MINUTES OPT OUT.

02:46:01.685 --> 02:46:03.019
THE BUSINESS PURPOSE CONSTRUCT

02:46:03.086 --> 02:46:04.654
IS A REALLY GOOD CONSTRUCT.

02:46:04.721 --> 02:46:06.256
AND THERE'S A LANGUAGE IN THE

02:46:06.323 --> 02:46:08.758
STATUTE IN CCPA THE RELATE SAID

02:46:08.825 --> 02:46:09.893
CUT TO CONTEXT BUT WE'VE BEEN

02:46:09.959 --> 02:46:11.194
TALKING ABOUT.

02:46:11.261 --> 02:46:13.530
SO IT HAS THE RIGHT IDEA BUT I

02:46:13.596 --> 02:46:16.833
WANT TO A FINE MAN.

02:46:16.900 --> 02:46:18.735
LET'S GO BACK TO THE EXAMPLE OF

02:46:18.802 --> 02:46:21.738
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED AND WE USE

02:46:21.805 --> 02:46:23.440
THE I SP EXAMPLE ACCOUNT.

02:46:23.506 --> 02:46:25.809
SO THE I. S. P.'S SEE WHERE I GO

02:46:25.875 --> 02:46:26.376
ON THE INTERNET BECAUSE THEY

02:46:26.443 --> 02:46:27.043
HAVE.

02:46:27.110 --> 02:46:27.711
TO THEY CAN USE THAT TO CREATE A

02:46:27.777 --> 02:46:29.713
PROFILE --

02:46:29.779 --> 02:46:31.848
WHAT INTEREST I HAVE THEY CAN

02:46:31.915 --> 02:46:34.084
THEN SELL AD PLACEMENT BASED ON

02:46:34.150 --> 02:46:35.151
THE PROFILE?

02:46:35.218 --> 02:46:37.387
INCLUDING GO TO BILLION THE

02:46:37.454 --> 02:46:39.789
TWENTY SIXTEEN ELECTION RIGHT --

02:46:39.856 --> 02:46:41.057
THEY WILL SAY THEY DON'T SELL

02:46:41.124 --> 02:46:42.659
THE RAW DATA AND I BELIEVE THAT

02:46:42.726 --> 02:46:44.561
THEY DON'T TELL THE RAW DATA BUT

02:46:44.627 --> 02:46:46.229
THEY ARE ENABLING THIS BE HERE

02:46:46.296 --> 02:46:47.230
FOREVER TIES IT IT'S OUT OF

02:46:47.297 --> 02:46:48.198
CONTEXT.

02:46:48.264 --> 02:46:50.967
SO I DON'T THINK IT'S ACCEPTABLE

02:46:51.034 --> 02:46:52.869
THAT I DON'T HAVE AN OPTION TO

02:46:52.936 --> 02:46:54.037
SAY YES OR NO TO THAT THAT'S A

02:46:54.104 --> 02:46:55.238
NEW DECISION.

02:46:55.305 --> 02:46:56.906
SO WHAT'S THE SOLUTION THE

02:46:56.973 --> 02:46:59.175
SOLUTION IS WHAT A FEW OF THE

02:46:59.242 --> 02:47:02.812
FOLKS TALKED ABOUT CCPA HAS IN A

02:47:02.879 --> 02:47:03.913
CAN SENT OVER SHARING.

02:47:03.980 --> 02:47:05.181
BUT EVERY OTHER PRIVACY

02:47:05.248 --> 02:47:06.950
FRAMEWORK THAT WE'VE USED HERE

02:47:07.016 --> 02:47:09.018
WHAT THE F. T. C.'S DONE WHAT

02:47:09.085 --> 02:47:10.954
THE FCC'S DONE.

02:47:11.020 --> 02:47:13.089
WHAT CHIEF YOURS DONE TALKS NOT

02:47:13.156 --> 02:47:13.556
JUST ABOUT SHARING THE

02:47:13.623 --> 02:47:14.691
COLLECTION AND USE I WANT TO

02:47:14.758 --> 02:47:16.126
MAKE THE DECISION DO I WANT THEM

02:47:16.192 --> 02:47:17.761
TO COLLECT THAT DATA?

02:47:17.827 --> 02:47:21.898
AND HOW THEY'RE GOING TO USE IT

02:47:21.965 --> 02:47:22.532
BASED ON WHAT FUNCTIONALITY I'M

02:47:22.599 --> 02:47:23.633
GOING TO GO.

02:47:23.700 --> 02:47:25.635
SO HOW DO YOU DO THAT --

02:47:25.702 --> 02:47:26.603
WE SHOULD INCLUDE COLLECTION AND

02:47:26.669 --> 02:47:28.438
USE IN THERE WHENEVER IT'S OUT

02:47:28.505 --> 02:47:29.806
OF CONTEXT WHENEVER IT'S NOT

02:47:29.873 --> 02:47:30.974
PART OF THE BUSINESS PURPOSE.

02:47:31.040 --> 02:47:33.643
OKAY SECOND REFINEMENT.

02:47:33.710 --> 02:47:34.644
HOW TO GET BACK INTO THIS OPTION

02:47:34.711 --> 02:47:36.079
VERSUS OPT OUT?

02:47:36.146 --> 02:47:37.380
SO THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE FROM

02:47:37.447 --> 02:47:38.581
THE CONSUMER POINT OF VIEW.

02:47:38.648 --> 02:47:40.683
BETWEEN EXAMPLE I'VE BEEN USING

02:47:40.750 --> 02:47:42.685
AN I. S. P. USING RIGHT ON THAT

02:47:42.752 --> 02:47:43.753
ARE FOR PEOPLE ADVERTISING AND

02:47:43.820 --> 02:47:45.522
LET ME GIVE ANOTHER EXAMPLE.

02:47:45.588 --> 02:47:49.092
SO SKYPE WHAT I USE SKYPE IT MAY

02:47:49.159 --> 02:47:50.894
ONE ACCESS TO MY ADDRESS BOOK --

02:47:50.960 --> 02:47:52.762
I MAY WANT TO SAY YES I MAY WANT

02:47:52.829 --> 02:47:54.431
TO SAY NO I'M GONNA VIEW THAT

02:47:54.497 --> 02:47:56.599
LIKELY ISN'T IN CONTEXT.

02:47:56.666 --> 02:47:58.234
IT ONCE IT BECAUSE IF I GIVE IT

02:47:58.301 --> 02:48:00.036
ACCESS I WON'T HAVE TO DIAL THE

02:48:00.103 --> 02:48:01.905
NUMBER I CAN JUST PULL IT UP.

02:48:01.971 --> 02:48:03.406
ON MIGHT MAKE A DECISION YES TO

02:48:03.473 --> 02:48:06.009
MAKE IMAGES YOU KNOW PERSONALLY

02:48:06.075 --> 02:48:06.643
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT

02:48:06.709 --> 02:48:07.076
TOP DOWN [inaudible]

02:48:07.143 --> 02:48:08.778
I THINK.

02:48:08.845 --> 02:48:10.013
SCRIBE GOES A STEP FURTHER

02:48:10.079 --> 02:48:11.347
CHOOSES TO MAKE IT UP.

02:48:11.414 --> 02:48:12.415
TO BUT I WOULDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM

02:48:12.482 --> 02:48:13.550
WITH THE BEING OPT OUT THIS IS

02:48:13.616 --> 02:48:13.883
SOME CONTEXT.

02:48:13.950 --> 02:48:14.951
SO I THINK YOU MAY BE ABLE TO

02:48:15.018 --> 02:48:16.653
USE THAT TO GUIDE YOUR DECISIONS

02:48:16.719 --> 02:48:18.455
COMING FORWARD ABOUT HOW TO

02:48:18.521 --> 02:48:20.190
REFINE.

02:48:20.256 --> 02:48:21.991
SO CONVINCED SUMMARY TERMS AND

02:48:22.058 --> 02:48:23.693
CONDITIONS PERFECTLY APPROPRIATE

02:48:23.760 --> 02:48:25.361
WHEN IT'S REQUIRED TO OPERATE

02:48:25.428 --> 02:48:26.896
THE SERVICE I'VE AGREED TO IT

02:48:26.963 --> 02:48:28.898
WHEN I SIGNED UP FOR THE SERVICE.

02:48:28.965 --> 02:48:30.066
UP DOWN WHEN IT GIVES ME ADDED

02:48:30.133 --> 02:48:31.734
FUNCTIONALITY BUT IT'S IN THE

02:48:31.801 --> 02:48:33.369
CONTEXT OF WHAT EXPECT THIS CAP

02:48:33.436 --> 02:48:34.838
OR SERVICE TO DO.

02:48:34.904 --> 02:48:37.073
AN OPT OUT WHEN IT'S PART OF

02:48:37.140 --> 02:48:40.643
CONTEXT AND SHOULD BE A NEW --

02:48:40.710 --> 02:48:42.812
TO I WANT TO COME BACK TO THE

02:48:42.879 --> 02:48:44.280
PART THAT I SKIPPED MY YOU'VE

02:48:44.347 --> 02:48:45.782
SHOULD EXPECT ME TO DO FIRST IS

02:48:45.849 --> 02:48:47.217
DO YOU WOULD HAVE THE

02:48:47.283 --> 02:48:48.218
INFORMATION THAT YOU WANT.

02:48:48.284 --> 02:48:49.486
IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT DECISION

02:48:49.552 --> 02:48:50.920
TO MAKE THAT CHOICE.

02:48:50.987 --> 02:48:55.024
SO CCPA ON USE TOOK A GOOD STEP

02:48:55.091 --> 02:48:57.560
IT SAID YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO

02:48:57.627 --> 02:48:58.928
KNOW THE CATEGORIES OF

02:48:58.995 --> 02:49:01.264
INFORMATION IS BEING COLLECTED

02:49:01.331 --> 02:49:02.565
AND THE PURPOSES.

02:49:02.632 --> 02:49:04.067
SO AN EXAMPLE AND I'LL COME BACK

02:49:04.133 --> 02:49:05.101
TO THE I. S. P. AGAIN IF YOU

02:49:05.168 --> 02:49:06.569
LOOK AT YOUR I. S. P.'S PRIVACY

02:49:06.636 --> 02:49:08.104
POLICY.

02:49:08.171 --> 02:49:09.873
IT WILL SAY SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

02:49:09.939 --> 02:49:12.308
IT UP ONE SECTION THAT SAYS

02:49:12.375 --> 02:49:14.043
INFORMATION WE COLLECT.

02:49:14.110 --> 02:49:15.311
END OF A LONG LIST BUT ONE OF

02:49:15.378 --> 02:49:16.246
THE THINGS IN THERE IS WHERE YOU

02:49:16.312 --> 02:49:17.847
GO ON THE INTERNET.

02:49:17.914 --> 02:49:19.382
ANOTHER THING IS GOING TO BE

02:49:19.449 --> 02:49:20.650
YOUR ZIP CODE OF WHERE YOU LIVE.

02:49:20.717 --> 02:49:22.018
THERE'S GONNA BE ANOTHER SECTION

02:49:22.085 --> 02:49:23.753
OF THE PRIVACY POLICY THE TALKS

02:49:23.820 --> 02:49:25.021
ABOUT HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION

02:49:25.088 --> 02:49:26.322
IS COLLECTED.

02:49:26.389 --> 02:49:27.891
AND ONE THING IN THERE IS GOING

02:49:27.957 --> 02:49:30.260
TO BE TO ROUTE SURE TRAFFIC

02:49:30.326 --> 02:49:32.095
WANTED OR THE NOTION OTHER.

02:49:32.161 --> 02:49:33.463
IN ANOTHER ONE MAYBE IT IS VERY

02:49:33.530 --> 02:49:36.099
LIKELY TO BE WE USE SOME OF YOUR

02:49:36.165 --> 02:49:37.600
INFORMATION FOR ADVERTISING.

02:49:37.667 --> 02:49:38.968
THIS IS ALL GOOD INFORMATION.

02:49:39.035 --> 02:49:41.371
BUT WHAT YOU REALLY WANNA KNOW

02:49:41.437 --> 02:49:43.773
IS IS MY I. S. P. USING WHERE I

02:49:43.840 --> 02:49:44.240
GO ON THE INTERNET FOR

02:49:44.307 --> 02:49:45.909
ADVERTISING.

02:49:45.975 --> 02:49:47.010
I KNOW THE COLLECTING AT ANOTHER

02:49:47.076 --> 02:49:48.745
USING SOMETHING FOR ADVERTISING

02:49:48.811 --> 02:49:49.679
I REALLY WANT TO HEAR THE TWO

02:49:49.746 --> 02:49:50.914
TOGETHER SO I CAN MAKE A

02:49:50.980 --> 02:49:53.283
MEANINGFUL CHOICE OF SAY YES I

02:49:53.349 --> 02:49:53.850
LIKE THAT OR NO I DON'T LIKE

02:49:53.917 --> 02:49:55.318
THAT.

02:49:55.385 --> 02:49:57.120
SO SOLUTION REFINEMENT THAT I'D

02:49:57.186 --> 02:49:58.187
SUGGEST --

02:49:58.254 --> 02:50:00.056
IN ADDITION TO WHAT TCPA DID OF

02:50:00.123 --> 02:50:02.025
DISCLOSING CATEGORIES.

02:50:02.091 --> 02:50:03.660
AND PURPOSES WE SHOULD PAIR THEM

02:50:03.726 --> 02:50:05.094
TOGETHER THEY SHOULD DISCLOSE

02:50:05.161 --> 02:50:07.230
THE PURPOSE FOR EVERY CATEGORY

02:50:07.297 --> 02:50:08.765
THAT THEY COLLECT.

02:50:08.831 --> 02:50:10.300
SO THAT AN ICE PICK AND SAY WE

02:50:10.366 --> 02:50:12.001
USE WERE YOU GO ON THE INTERNET

02:50:12.068 --> 02:50:13.570
FOR BEAVER ADVERTISING.

02:50:13.636 --> 02:50:15.204
HORSE OF THE CAN SEE NOW WE

02:50:15.271 --> 02:50:17.240
DON'T USE WHERE YOU GO ON THE

02:50:17.307 --> 02:50:19.943
INTERNET PROVIDER TIES AND WE

02:50:20.009 --> 02:50:20.577
JUST USE IT TO GET YOU WHERE YOU

02:50:20.643 --> 02:50:21.678
WANT TO GO.

02:50:21.744 --> 02:50:23.012
OKAY --

02:50:23.079 --> 02:50:23.813
ANOTHER THING THAT I WANT TO

02:50:23.880 --> 02:50:26.516
HEAR AN INFORMATION IS SHARED SO

02:50:26.583 --> 02:50:28.818
CCPA AGAIN TAKES A GOOD STEP.

02:50:28.885 --> 02:50:30.787
THAT SAYS YOU SHOULD KNOW THE

02:50:30.853 --> 02:50:32.455
CATEGORIES INFORMATION THAT ARE

02:50:32.522 --> 02:50:33.222
SHARED.

02:50:33.289 --> 02:50:33.890
AND YOU SHOULD KNOW THE

02:50:33.957 --> 02:50:35.792
CATEGORIES OF THIRD PARTIES THAT

02:50:35.858 --> 02:50:36.793
IT SHARED WITH.

02:50:36.859 --> 02:50:38.461
SO WE HAVE A SIMILAR PROBLEM

02:50:38.528 --> 02:50:40.163
THAT WAS TOUCHED ON BEFORE.

02:50:40.229 --> 02:50:41.664
IS YOUR I. S. P. IS LIKELY TO

02:50:41.731 --> 02:50:44.200
SAY WE DO SHARE SOME KIND OF

02:50:44.267 --> 02:50:45.902
INFORMATION DERIVED FROM WHERE

02:50:45.969 --> 02:50:46.903
YOU GO ON THE INTERNET.

02:50:46.970 --> 02:50:49.505
NOT THE RAW DATA BUT SOMETHING

02:50:49.572 --> 02:50:51.374
THAT ALLOWS ADVERTISERS.

02:50:51.441 --> 02:50:53.209
THEN WE SHARE YOUR ZIP CODE.

02:50:53.276 --> 02:50:54.177
AND THEN A SEPARATE SECTION

02:50:54.243 --> 02:50:55.044
THEY'LL SAY WE SHARE WITH

02:50:55.111 --> 02:50:56.279
RESEARCHERS AND WE SHARE WITH

02:50:56.346 --> 02:50:56.879
ADVERTISERS.

02:50:56.946 --> 02:50:58.648
OKAY GREAT BUT WHAT I REALLY

02:50:58.715 --> 02:51:01.317
WANT TO KNOW IS JUST BY I. S. P.

02:51:01.384 --> 02:51:02.552
SHARED INFORMATION DERIVED FROM

02:51:02.619 --> 02:51:03.720
WHERE I GO ON THE INTERNET WITH

02:51:03.786 --> 02:51:05.989
ADVERTISERS.

02:51:06.055 --> 02:51:06.556
OR THEY JUST SHARING OF THE

02:51:06.623 --> 02:51:07.824
RESEARCHERS.

02:51:07.890 --> 02:51:08.891
AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER BIG

02:51:08.958 --> 02:51:10.627
DIFFERENCE AND I MAY WANT TO SAY

02:51:10.693 --> 02:51:12.028
YES TO ONE ANOTHER THE OTHER.

02:51:12.095 --> 02:51:13.296
SO THAT'S ANOTHER REFINEMENT

02:51:13.363 --> 02:51:17.133
THAT WE CAN TAKE IS TO SAY.

02:51:17.200 --> 02:51:18.668
TELL ME THIS PARENTS.

02:51:18.735 --> 02:51:21.204
TELL ME WITH WHO YOU SHARE WHAT

02:51:21.270 --> 02:51:22.805
YOU SHARE WITH THEM.

02:51:22.872 --> 02:51:24.140
I WANT TO BRIEFLY JUST HIT ON A

02:51:24.207 --> 02:51:25.742
COUPLE OF OTHER ASPECTS --

02:51:25.808 --> 02:51:26.809
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION

02:51:26.876 --> 02:51:29.979
ABOUT INSPECTION AND DELETION --

02:51:30.046 --> 02:51:33.616
I JUST WANT TO RE EMPHASIZE THAT

02:51:33.683 --> 02:51:34.917
THIS IS ANOTHER WEEK PART.

02:51:34.984 --> 02:51:37.353
THAT WE CAN IMPROVE.

02:51:37.420 --> 02:51:38.521
IT SAID THAT WE HAD TO THE

02:51:38.588 --> 02:51:41.224
INTENT THAT WE KNOW THAT MY

02:51:41.290 --> 02:51:42.592
INFORMATION PROPAGATE SHOULD THE

02:51:42.659 --> 02:51:44.560
ECO SYSTEM --

02:51:44.627 --> 02:51:45.561
I'M NOT TRYING TO AVOID THAT BUT

02:51:45.628 --> 02:51:47.430
IN ORDER.

02:51:47.497 --> 02:51:49.399
TO EXERCISE MY RIGHTS I NEED TO

02:51:49.465 --> 02:51:52.068
BE ABLE TO TRACK WHO DID IT GO.

02:51:52.135 --> 02:51:53.036
TO IN I NEED TO BE ABLE TO TRACK

02:51:53.102 --> 02:51:55.071
WHERE DID IT COME FROM.

02:51:55.138 --> 02:51:56.305
AND THERE'S SOME GREAT EXAMPLES

02:51:56.372 --> 02:51:58.441
OF HOW TO IMPLEMENT THAT.

02:51:58.508 --> 02:52:00.410
BUT IF WE REALLY WANT USERS TO

02:52:00.476 --> 02:52:02.011
BE ABLE TO EXERCISE THESE RIGHTS.

02:52:02.078 --> 02:52:03.346
THEN WE NEED TO PROVIDE THEM

02:52:03.413 --> 02:52:05.515
BOTH WHERE DID IT GO TO LIST

02:52:05.581 --> 02:52:06.482
PARTIES.

02:52:06.549 --> 02:52:08.184
AND WHEN I KNOW WHAT THIRD PARTY

02:52:08.251 --> 02:52:09.318
HAS SOME OF MY INFORMATION.

02:52:09.385 --> 02:52:10.887
WHERE DID IT COME FROM SAID I

02:52:10.953 --> 02:52:12.188
CAN GO BACK TO TURN THE KNOB IF

02:52:12.255 --> 02:52:13.723
I WANT TO SAY YES OR NO?

02:52:13.790 --> 02:52:16.225
SO I CAN TURN THAT BACK OFF I

02:52:16.292 --> 02:52:20.196
WANT TO TURN THEM BACK OFF --

02:52:20.263 --> 02:52:22.331
ON THE COUPLE OF THINGS THAT

02:52:22.398 --> 02:52:23.833
HAVE BEEN MENTIONED I'M NOT

02:52:23.900 --> 02:52:25.301
GONNA HELP EXPLICIT ADVICE HERE.

02:52:25.368 --> 02:52:26.803
BUT JUST TO BE ABLE TO INFORM

02:52:26.869 --> 02:52:28.204
THE DISCUSSION.

02:52:28.271 --> 02:52:30.873
THERE WAS DISCUSSION ABOUT THE

02:52:30.940 --> 02:52:33.710
IDENTIFIED ABOUT ANONYMOUS ON

02:52:33.776 --> 02:52:35.111
THE THE NEXT PANELIST WILL ADD

02:52:35.178 --> 02:52:36.512
MORE DETAIL TO IT BUT I JUST

02:52:36.579 --> 02:52:37.613
WANT TO GIVE YOU CONTEXT.

02:52:37.680 --> 02:52:40.950
SO THE CONCEPT OF DE IDENTIFIED

02:52:41.017 --> 02:52:42.719
THE TEST THAT YOU PUT IN C. C.

02:52:42.785 --> 02:52:45.054
P. EIGHT IS THE RIGHT TEST.

02:52:45.121 --> 02:52:45.688
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT LANGUAGE IN

02:52:45.755 --> 02:52:46.322
THERE.

02:52:46.389 --> 02:52:48.991
BUT I DON'T WANT YOU TO CONFUSE

02:52:49.058 --> 02:52:51.360
WHERE THIS TECHNOLOGY CAME FROM

02:52:51.427 --> 02:52:52.962
AND HOW IT'S BEING DISCUSSED.

02:52:53.029 --> 02:52:55.998
IT CAME FROM HAVING DATA SETS

02:52:56.065 --> 02:52:57.600
LIKE LIST OF HEALTH OUTCOMES YOU

02:52:57.667 --> 02:53:00.236
KNOW A FIFTY SEVEN YEAR OLD MALE.

02:53:00.303 --> 02:53:01.738
HAD THE FOLLOWING MEDICAL ISSUE

02:53:01.804 --> 02:53:04.774
NO NAME NO IDENTITY ATTACHED.

02:53:04.841 --> 02:53:06.342
GREAT BUT THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO

02:53:06.409 --> 02:53:08.945
ADVERTISING ON THE INTERNET.

02:53:09.011 --> 02:53:10.413
DON'T THINK THAT THAT THAT THAT

02:53:10.480 --> 02:53:12.048
SHOWED UP.

02:53:12.115 --> 02:53:14.250
ON LIKE CLAIMS YOU HEARD EARLIER

02:53:14.317 --> 02:53:15.084
DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WHO

02:53:15.151 --> 02:53:16.385
YOU ARE.

02:53:16.452 --> 02:53:17.887
THAT AND IN ORDER TO BE PLACED

02:53:17.954 --> 02:53:19.856
ON THERE HAS YOUR I. P. ADDRESS

KINDS OF INFORMATION ABOUT YOU.

02:53:23.693 --> 02:53:25.361
IN THAT AD ITSELF CAN COLLECT

02:53:25.428 --> 02:53:26.796
MORE INFORMATION.

02:53:26.863 --> 02:53:28.531
BECAUSE IT HAS SOFTWARE CODE

02:53:28.598 --> 02:53:30.833
BEHIND IT THEY CAN COLLECT MORE.

02:53:30.900 --> 02:53:32.635
SO DE IDENTIFIED IS A GREAT

02:53:32.702 --> 02:53:33.970
THING A BLIGHTED TODAY ARE JUST

02:53:34.036 --> 02:53:35.071
I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK THAT

02:53:35.138 --> 02:53:37.840
THAT SOLVES THE ADVERTISING

02:53:37.907 --> 02:53:39.041

02:53:52.288 --> 02:53:54.457
EXAMPLES FROM COMPANIES THAT

USEFUL AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND

I THINK --

02:55:40.263 --> 02:55:41.831
KIND OF IN SHORT.

02:55:41.898 --> 02:55:43.633
I WANTED TO SUMMARIZE SOME OF

02:55:43.699 --> 02:55:45.835
WHAT THE PALACE PUT PRIOR TO ME

02:55:45.902 --> 02:55:49.338
SAID SAY AND WHILE THIS AREA IS

02:55:49.405 --> 02:55:50.973
VERY COMPLICATED.

02:55:51.040 --> 02:55:52.675
I THINK I DON'T THINK CCPA

02:55:52.742 --> 02:55:55.311
ACTUALLY IS ALL THAT COMPLICATED --

02:55:55.378 --> 02:55:57.613
IT'SA VERY NARROW POLICY

02:55:57.680 --> 02:55:59.048
FRAMEWORK PERMITTING CALIFORNIA

02:55:59.115 --> 02:56:00.383
CONSUMERS WERE CONCERNED ABOUT

02:56:00.449 --> 02:56:03.252
PRIVACY. TO OPT OUT OF THE SALE

02:56:03.319 --> 02:56:04.220
OF THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION.

02:56:04.287 --> 02:56:05.888
AND WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT IS IF

02:56:05.955 --> 02:56:07.590
YOU LOOK AT THE CURRENT PRIVACY

02:56:07.657 --> 02:56:09.959
FOR MARK IN THE U. S. WERE --

02:56:10.026 --> 02:56:11.727
THE FTC'S AUTHORITY FOR EXAMPLE

02:56:11.794 --> 02:56:13.129
UNDER SECTION FIVE WHICH GOVERNS

02:56:13.195 --> 02:56:14.630
UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE TRADE

02:56:14.697 --> 02:56:15.598
PRACTICES.

02:56:15.665 --> 02:56:17.533
IT'S OFTEN BASED ON WHAT

02:56:17.600 --> 02:56:19.135
STATEMENTS COMPANIES MAKE TO

02:56:19.201 --> 02:56:20.569
CONSUMERS AND WHETHER THOSE

02:56:20.636 --> 02:56:22.371
STATEMENTS ARE DECEPTIVE. ONE OF

02:56:22.438 --> 02:56:23.606
THE CHALLENGES WITH A FRAMEWORK

02:56:23.673 --> 02:56:26.575
IS THAT AS OTHER PANELS OF

02:56:26.642 --> 02:56:27.476
HIGHLIGHTED --

02:56:27.543 --> 02:56:29.445
WHEN YOU INTERACT WITH A WEBSITE

02:56:29.512 --> 02:56:30.980
YOU'RE ACTUALLY INTERACTING WITH

02:56:31.047 --> 02:56:32.882
A NUMBER OF OTHER PARTIES AND

02:56:32.949 --> 02:56:34.317
DATA BROKERS OR YOU KNOW AND --

02:56:34.383 --> 02:56:37.753
ACT WITH A PHYSICAL STORE THEY

02:56:37.820 --> 02:56:40.589
HAD IT ALL IRAQ WITH THOSE

02:56:40.656 --> 02:56:42.992
NOTICES AND IT'S AWARE THAT --

02:56:43.059 --> 02:56:45.528
THE FTC WILL GO AND FORCE UNDER

02:56:45.594 --> 02:56:48.164
THESE THESE THIRD PARTY NOTICES

02:56:48.230 --> 02:56:50.733
BECAUSE SOME ARGUE WHETHER THEIR

02:56:50.800 --> 02:56:52.168
MATERIAL.

02:56:52.234 --> 02:56:52.735
AS A RESULT OF CONSUMERS NOT

02:56:52.802 --> 02:56:53.836
SEEING THAT.

02:56:53.903 --> 02:56:55.504
RIGHT AND IF YOU CAN ONLY LOOK

02:56:55.571 --> 02:56:56.939
AT THE TWENTY FOURTEEN FTC DATA

02:56:57.006 --> 02:56:58.541
BROKE REPORT TO HIGHLIGHT SOME

02:56:58.607 --> 02:57:00.076
OF THESE GAPS AND POLICY.

02:57:00.142 --> 02:57:01.744
AND SO WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT IS

02:57:01.811 --> 02:57:03.846
THAT THE CITY PAY FOCUSES ON

02:57:03.913 --> 02:57:06.015
EXACTLY THESE THIRD PARTIES

02:57:06.082 --> 02:57:07.750
ALLOWS CONSUMERS TO THE OPT OUT

02:57:07.817 --> 02:57:09.318
OF THE SALE OF THESE INFORMATION

02:57:09.385 --> 02:57:11.087
TO THESE THIRD PARTIES.

02:57:11.153 --> 02:57:12.588
AND FOCUSES KIND OF OTHER

02:57:12.655 --> 02:57:13.889
ENFORCEMENT REGIMES AROUND THE

02:57:13.956 --> 02:57:15.391
FIRST PARTY INTERACTION WITH

02:57:15.458 --> 02:57:16.993
STAFF TO SEE FOR EXAMPLE CAN

02:57:17.059 --> 02:57:18.627
GOVERN I THINK QUITE WELL.

02:57:18.694 --> 02:57:22.565
AND THIS PANEL AS AS IS DUBBED

02:57:22.631 --> 02:57:24.100
KIND WHAT'S BEYOND TO CPA EVEN

02:57:24.166 --> 02:57:25.434
DOT ONLY HEARD OF A NUMBER OF

02:57:25.501 --> 02:57:26.168
OTHER ISSUES LIKE FACE

02:57:26.235 --> 02:57:28.804
RECOGNITION GEO LOCATION.

02:57:28.871 --> 02:57:30.272
A AYE INFERENCE BIAS ALL OF

02:57:30.339 --> 02:57:30.806
THESE ARE --

02:57:30.873 --> 02:57:32.608
SO PRIVACY ISSUES AND EVEN NOT

02:57:32.675 --> 02:57:34.410
ONLY HEARD THAT CONGRESS AND

02:57:34.477 --> 02:57:35.778
OTHER STATES ARE LOOKING AT THIS

02:57:35.845 --> 02:57:37.113
WHAT I'M AFRAID IS THAT --

02:57:37.179 --> 02:57:38.447
GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF THESE

02:57:38.514 --> 02:57:39.548
ISSUES IN A NUMBER OF OTHER

02:57:39.615 --> 02:57:41.050
TOPICS THAT FALL UNDER THE

02:57:41.117 --> 02:57:43.152
PRIVACY AND BROTHER I'LL SUCH AS

02:57:43.219 --> 02:57:44.286
A AYE BIAS.

02:57:44.353 --> 02:57:45.221
WHAT WILL ULTIMATELY GET IN THE

02:57:45.287 --> 02:57:47.456
U. S. AS A FRAMER IS GOING TO BE

02:57:47.523 --> 02:57:49.191
A NOTHER KIND OF NOTICE AND

02:57:49.258 --> 02:57:50.860
CHOICE FRAMEWORK THAT REQUIRES

02:57:50.926 --> 02:57:52.028
CONSUMERS TO MAKE DECISIONS

02:57:52.094 --> 02:57:53.963
ABOUT WHETHER THAT WAY COMPANIES

02:57:54.030 --> 02:57:55.364
USE INFORMATION I SHARE THE

02:57:55.431 --> 02:57:57.299
INFORMATION IS ADEQUATE?

02:57:57.366 --> 02:58:01.537
AND I THINK WHY THAT'S

02:58:01.604 --> 02:58:02.138
CHALLENGING AS AGAIN AS WE'VE

02:58:02.204 --> 02:58:04.607
HEARD -- AN

02:58:04.673 --> 02:58:06.075
A I CAN MAKE AN AND FRIENDS OR

02:58:06.142 --> 02:58:07.610
KIND OF MACHINE LEARNING CAN

02:58:07.676 --> 02:58:08.511
MAKE INFERENCES THAT THEY DIDN'T

02:58:08.577 --> 02:58:09.545
UNDERSTAND.

02:58:09.612 --> 02:58:10.212
SO I THINK IT'S A POINT TO THINK

02:58:10.279 --> 02:58:12.281
ABOUT THIS PRIVACY LAW AND

02:58:12.348 --> 02:58:14.083
ENOUGH IN THE IN THAT CONTEXT

02:58:14.150 --> 02:58:15.317
WHERE WE MIGHT GET SOMETHING

02:58:15.384 --> 02:58:16.352
DOWN THE PIKE BUT I THINK WHAT

02:58:16.419 --> 02:58:18.054
WILK END UP GETTING IS MORE OF

02:58:18.120 --> 02:58:18.721
THE SAME AND I DON'T THINK WE'LL

02:58:18.788 --> 02:58:19.321
GET.

02:58:19.388 --> 02:58:21.457
SOMETHING LIKE A EUROPEAN STYLE

02:58:21.524 --> 02:58:23.392
SO WHAT THIS LOT PROTECTS AREAS

02:58:23.459 --> 02:58:25.995
WHERE THE KERN FORCES DON'T HAVE --

02:58:26.062 --> 02:58:27.863
A KIND OF A LOT OF AUTHORITY OR

02:58:27.930 --> 02:58:28.297
DON'T HAVE A LOT OF

02:58:28.364 --> 02:58:29.565
EFFECTIVENESS.

02:58:29.632 --> 02:58:30.399
ON THE OTHER.

02:58:30.466 --> 02:58:35.004
KRYCEKI'VE HEARD IS THAT --

02:58:35.071 --> 02:58:36.472
THERE'S OF BIGNESS IN THAT CITY

02:58:36.539 --> 02:58:37.039
PAY THE MAKES AN UNTENABLE

02:58:37.106 --> 02:58:38.040
YOU'VE HEARD A NUMBER OF STRAW

02:58:38.107 --> 02:58:39.675
MAN ARGUMENTS FOR EXAMPLE ON THE

02:58:39.742 --> 02:58:40.976
AG REQUIRING COMPANIES TO

02:58:41.043 --> 02:58:42.411
RESPONSE ON AUTHENTICATED.

02:58:42.478 --> 02:58:45.448
USER REQUESTS RIGHT AND AND AND

02:58:45.514 --> 02:58:46.415
GIVE OVER --

02:58:46.482 --> 02:58:47.983
KIND OF INFORMATION CONSUMERS

02:58:48.050 --> 02:58:49.885
THAT AREN'T WHO THEY REPORT TO

02:58:49.952 --> 02:58:51.120
BE -- I

02:58:51.187 --> 02:58:52.655
THINK THOSE COMMENTS ARE KIND OF

02:58:52.721 --> 02:58:53.756
A LITTLE BIT IT --

02:58:53.823 --> 02:58:54.990
DECEIVING AND AND NOT REALLY

02:58:55.057 --> 02:58:58.094
EFFECTIVE DATE WE LEFT A LOT

02:58:58.160 --> 02:58:59.061
HELPED WITH --

02:58:59.128 --> 02:59:01.831
CONSOLE WITH --

02:59:01.897 --> 02:59:05.234
MR TAGGART AND OF SPOKE THE RAGS

02:59:05.301 --> 02:59:06.435
PRECISELY BECAUSE IT'S AN

02:59:06.502 --> 02:59:09.205
INCREDIBLY TECHNICAL FIELD AND

02:59:09.271 --> 02:59:10.506
IN THE COSTS INVOLVING SO.

02:59:10.573 --> 02:59:13.142
LEAVING IT UP TO THE AG TO

02:59:13.209 --> 02:59:14.577
DEFINE FOR EXAMPLE VERIFIABLE

02:59:14.643 --> 02:59:16.445
USER REQUEST I THINK IS CRITICAL

02:59:16.512 --> 02:59:17.680
AND THAT ALLOWS THE STANDARD TO

02:59:17.746 --> 02:59:19.882
EVOLVE OVER TIME IN FIVE YEARS

02:59:19.949 --> 02:59:21.016
WILL LIKELY NOT EVEN BE USING

02:59:21.083 --> 02:59:22.351
USERNAMES PASSWORDS.

02:59:22.418 --> 02:59:23.285
SO WHAT IT MEANS TO BE AN

02:59:23.352 --> 02:59:24.787
AUTHENTICATED USER IS GOING TO

02:59:24.854 --> 02:59:26.288
CHANGE OVER TIME AND YOU WANT TO

02:59:26.355 --> 02:59:28.357
ALLOW THAT FLEXIBILITY.

02:59:28.424 --> 02:59:29.258
RIGHT AT ROOM --

02:59:29.325 --> 02:59:30.659
UNDERSTANDABLY COME COMPANIES

02:59:30.726 --> 02:59:31.727
ARE CONCERNED THAT THOSE ROADS

02:59:31.794 --> 02:59:33.529
AREN'T FURNISHED BUT I THINK --

02:59:33.596 --> 02:59:34.864
I WOULD TRUST THE PETE THE GOOD

02:59:34.930 --> 02:59:36.465
PEOPLE AT THE AG TO ACTUALLY GO

02:59:36.532 --> 02:59:37.900
THROUGH AND AND THINK THROUGH

02:59:37.967 --> 02:59:40.302
THESE HARD ISSUES AND PROVIDE --

02:59:40.369 --> 02:59:41.704
SENSIBLE GUIDE THIS GUIDE AND

02:59:41.770 --> 02:59:43.405
GUIDANCE AND ADDITIONALLY --

02:59:43.472 --> 02:59:45.975
REGARDING THE GUIDANCE --

02:59:46.041 --> 02:59:47.276
TO REGARDING THE CONCERNED BY

02:59:47.343 --> 02:59:49.478
THE AGE OF HAVING TO RESPOND TO

02:59:49.545 --> 02:59:50.446
CAN THE COMPANIES REQUEST FOR

02:59:50.513 --> 02:59:52.014
DIRECT GUIDANCE I THINK IT'S

02:59:52.081 --> 02:59:53.649
MERITED BUT I MIGHT SUGGEST

02:59:53.716 --> 02:59:56.652
LOOKING AT THE FTC'S DCV THE

02:59:56.719 --> 02:59:57.620
DIVISION OF CONSUMER AND

02:59:57.686 --> 02:59:59.355
BUSINESS EDUCATION.

02:59:59.421 --> 03:00:01.090
IN THE WAYS THEY PROVIDE PUBLIC

03:00:01.157 --> 03:00:03.392
GUIDANCE AND HOW RESOURCE AND

03:00:03.459 --> 03:00:04.426
MAYBE ONE A RESOURCE STAGE YOU

03:00:04.493 --> 03:00:06.428
TO DO THIS BETTER BUT THEY ARE

03:00:06.495 --> 03:00:07.830
ABLE TO PROVIDE PUBLIC GUIDANCE

03:00:07.897 --> 03:00:09.865
IN AND AROUND THESE ISSUES LIKE

03:00:09.932 --> 03:00:10.900
AN FAQ.

03:00:10.966 --> 03:00:15.304
RATHER THAN DOING SPECIFIC

03:00:15.371 --> 03:00:19.175
RESPONSES TO SEE --

03:00:19.241 --> 03:00:20.676
FINALLY I THINK THE BIGGEST

03:00:20.743 --> 03:00:21.844
POINT OF CONTENTION AND YOU'VE

03:00:21.911 --> 03:00:22.945
HEARD A LITTLE BIT OF OF IT

03:00:23.012 --> 03:00:23.913
TODAY TOUCHED --

03:00:23.979 --> 03:00:25.147
IS AROUND THIS ISSUE OF SUIT

03:00:25.214 --> 03:00:27.216
IDENTIFIERS AND AND WHAT IT

03:00:27.283 --> 03:00:30.319
MEANS TO BE PERSONAL INFORMATION --

03:00:30.386 --> 03:00:31.720
WE'VE HEARD A AND I'VE SEEN THE

03:00:31.787 --> 03:00:32.922
CHAMBER IN OTHER LETTERS ARGUE

03:00:32.988 --> 03:00:34.056
THAT PSEUDO IDENTIFIERS ARE

03:00:34.123 --> 03:00:35.925
PSEUDONYMOUS TRACKING IS NOT

03:00:35.991 --> 03:00:37.126
PERSONAL INFORMATION AND WHAT WE

03:00:37.193 --> 03:00:38.594
MEAN BY PSEUDONYMOUS TRACKING IS

03:00:38.661 --> 03:00:39.795
SOMETHING THAT'S NOT YOUR NAME

03:00:39.862 --> 03:00:40.229
SO.

03:00:40.296 --> 03:00:41.931
ASSIGNING JUST AN IDENTIFIER A

03:00:41.997 --> 03:00:43.265
RANDOM STRING OF NUMBERS TO LIKE

03:00:43.332 --> 03:00:45.167
YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER IS A

03:00:45.234 --> 03:00:46.669
PSEUDO IDENTIFIER RIGHT IT

03:00:46.735 --> 03:00:47.937
REFERS TO UNIQUELY AND

03:00:48.003 --> 03:00:49.772
IDENTIFIES A PARTICULAR CONSUMER

03:00:49.838 --> 03:00:51.173
NOT A WOMAN IN THE ROOM BECAUSE

03:00:51.240 --> 03:00:52.875
I WON IDENTIFY MAYBE FIFTY

03:00:52.942 --> 03:00:53.609
CONSUMERS.

03:00:53.676 --> 03:00:55.844
BUT WHEN IT GETS DOWN TO QUE OF

03:00:55.911 --> 03:00:56.645
ZERO ONE WHEN IT DEFIES ONE

03:00:56.712 --> 03:00:58.447
PERSON THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT

03:00:58.514 --> 03:00:59.248
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

03:00:59.315 --> 03:01:01.450
AND ANOTHER ANOTHER KIND OF

03:01:01.517 --> 03:01:02.751
SOMETIMES IDENTIFIERS ARE

03:01:02.818 --> 03:01:05.487
RANDOMLY ASSIGNED LIKE ONE TWO

03:01:05.554 --> 03:01:06.855
THREE FOUR SOMETIMES AND MORE

03:01:06.922 --> 03:01:08.591
OFTEN THE THE WAY --

03:01:08.657 --> 03:01:09.792
KIND OF THAT THE DATA BURKE

03:01:09.858 --> 03:01:10.893
INDUSTRY WORKS IS THAT BASED ON

03:01:10.960 --> 03:01:11.894
WHAT ARE KNOWN AS HASHED

03:01:11.961 --> 03:01:13.762
IDENTIFIERS AND A HASH IS JUST A

03:01:13.829 --> 03:01:15.097
MATHEMATIC MATHEMATICAL

03:01:15.164 --> 03:01:16.999
TRANSFORMATION OF A SET OF

03:01:17.066 --> 03:01:18.400
NUMBERS ARE CHARACTERS.

03:01:18.467 --> 03:01:19.635
SO IF YOU'RE MEMBER --

03:01:19.702 --> 03:01:22.238
CRACKER JACKS LITTLE ROTATOR

03:01:22.304 --> 03:01:22.805
RING AN OLD CRACKED CRACKER

03:01:22.871 --> 03:01:23.939
JACKS --

03:01:24.006 --> 03:01:24.974
THAT --

03:01:25.040 --> 03:01:25.874
BOXES WHERE YOU COULD SEE

03:01:25.941 --> 03:01:26.842
CLEARLY COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR

03:01:26.909 --> 03:01:28.244
FRIENDS THOUSAND EXAMPLE OF THE

03:01:28.310 --> 03:01:29.378
WEEK CASH WAS CALLED A ROTATION

03:01:29.445 --> 03:01:35.484
HASH OF ONE SO --

03:01:35.551 --> 03:01:36.085
HAD CHAO FOR EXAMPLE WOULD BE

03:01:36.151 --> 03:01:38.988
SOME AND I CAN REFER TO YOU AS

03:01:39.054 --> 03:01:40.656
THAT AND AND NIKKI COULD REFER

03:01:40.723 --> 03:01:41.457
TO IS THAT WE CAN SHARE

03:01:41.523 --> 03:01:43.259
INFORMATION ABOUT YOU LIKE YOUR

03:07:27.936 --> 03:07:28.837
RIGHT.

03:07:28.904 --> 03:07:30.372
THEY'RE THE ONES WHO DON'T EVEN

03:07:30.439 --> 03:07:32.541
KNOW A LOT OF THE TIME WHAT'S

03:07:32.608 --> 03:07:34.343
GOING ON IN THE BACKGROUND AND

03:07:34.409 --> 03:07:35.577
SO HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY ASKING

03:07:35.644 --> 03:07:37.613
THEM. TO COMPLY WITH ALL THESE

03:07:37.679 --> 03:07:39.047
ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS TO

03:07:39.114 --> 03:07:40.816
DISCLOSE INFORMATION WHEN THEY

03:07:40.882 --> 03:07:42.618
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE REST OF THE

03:07:42.684 --> 03:07:43.752
ECOSYSTEM IS DOING.

03:07:43.819 --> 03:07:45.954
ITS AN ECOSYSTEM ADVERTISING

03:07:46.021 --> 03:07:48.790
TECHNOLOGY IS AN ECOSYSTEM.

03:07:48.857 --> 03:07:50.158
I WANT TO GET MY NEWS NOT JUST

03:07:50.225 --> 03:07:51.793
FROM GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK I WANNA

03:07:51.860 --> 03:07:53.061
GET MY NEWS FROM ALL KINDS OF

03:07:53.128 --> 03:07:54.763
PUBLISHERS BUT THEY ARE ALL

03:07:54.830 --> 03:07:55.897
CONNECTED TO THE SAME AD TECH

03:07:55.964 --> 03:07:57.899
ECOSYSTEM WHICH IS IMPACTED BY

03:07:57.966 --> 03:07:58.867
THIS LAW.

03:07:58.934 --> 03:08:00.068
AND SO YOU'VE TOO MANY PLAYERS

03:08:00.135 --> 03:08:01.269
WHO DON'T KNOW HOW TO COMPLY

03:08:01.336 --> 03:08:02.904
WITH ALL THESE INCONSISTENT

03:08:02.971 --> 03:08:04.339
OVERLAPPING REQUIREMENTS THAT

03:08:04.406 --> 03:08:05.974
ARE NOT TAILORED TO THE

03:08:06.041 --> 03:08:07.843
INDIVIDUAL PLAYERS IN THE SYSTEM.

03:08:07.909 --> 03:08:10.579
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE TECHNOLOGY

03:08:10.646 --> 03:08:12.514
BASED BUT DOES AFTER WRECKING

03:08:12.581 --> 03:08:14.783
THIS ECOSYSTEM.

03:08:14.850 --> 03:08:15.617
SO.

03:08:15.684 --> 03:08:17.019
IF YOU WANT US TO BE ABLE TO DE

03:08:17.085 --> 03:08:18.687
IDENTIFY DATA.

03:08:18.754 --> 03:08:21.523
THEN TELL US WHAT THAT MEANS AND

03:08:21.590 --> 03:08:24.059
IT'S NOT FAIR TO SAY YOU CAN DE

03:08:24.126 --> 03:08:25.460
IDENTIFY THE DATA AND HOW WOULD

03:08:25.527 --> 03:08:27.229
BE NOT PERSONAL INFORMATION IF

03:08:27.295 --> 03:08:28.964
YOU THEN TURN AROUND AND SAY WE

03:08:29.031 --> 03:08:31.266
CAN'T REALLY DE IDENTIFIED WITH

03:08:31.333 --> 03:08:32.567
THE TECHNOLOGY THAT EXISTS TODAY.

03:08:32.634 --> 03:08:33.602
BECAUSE THAT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE

03:08:33.669 --> 03:08:35.303
SAYING IT'S ALL PERSONAL

03:08:35.370 --> 03:08:35.904
INFORMATION AND THERE'S NO WAY

03:08:35.971 --> 03:08:37.139
TO DO IT.

03:08:37.205 --> 03:08:38.874
BY DE IDENTIFICATION.

03:08:38.940 --> 03:08:41.443
PRIVACY IS GOOD FOR BUSINESS AND

03:08:41.510 --> 03:08:42.978
BUSINESSES ARE WORKING REALLY

03:08:43.045 --> 03:08:44.413
HARD UNDER EXISTING LAW ON BEST

03:08:44.479 --> 03:08:46.448
PRACTICES TO DO RIGHT BY

03:08:46.515 --> 03:08:47.482
CONSUMERS.

03:08:47.549 --> 03:08:50.152
THERE ARE EXISTING CHOICES UNDER

03:08:50.218 --> 03:08:52.354
THE NA I AND AD CHOICES SELF

03:08:52.421 --> 03:08:54.856
REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS USERS CAN

03:08:54.923 --> 03:08:57.159
IN FACT ALREADY CHOOSE NOT TO BE

03:08:57.225 --> 03:08:58.760
TRACKED BY THIRD PARTIES ON

03:08:58.827 --> 03:08:59.861
WEBSITES.

03:08:59.928 --> 03:09:01.830
THAT EXISTS THEY JUST HAVE TO

03:09:01.897 --> 03:09:03.965
CLICK THROUGH TO THOSE OPTIONS

03:09:04.032 --> 03:09:06.968
THERE'S A LITTLE ICON ON THE

03:09:07.035 --> 03:09:09.237
THIS IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THOSE

03:09:09.304 --> 03:09:10.539
CONCERNS ABOUT THE PLAYERS

03:09:10.605 --> 03:09:13.308
BEHIND THE SCENES IS IT PERFECT.

03:09:13.375 --> 03:09:15.077
NO MOST THINGS AREN'T.

03:09:15.143 --> 03:09:16.778
BUT THERE ARE OPTIONS IN PEOPLE

03:09:16.845 --> 03:09:19.414
SHOULDN'T BE TOLD THEY DON'T

03:09:19.481 --> 03:09:21.183
HAVE OPTIONS BECAUSE THEY DO.

03:09:21.249 --> 03:09:22.751
SO -- THERE

03:09:22.818 --> 03:09:24.186
IS ALREADY AS WELL AS BEEN

03:09:24.252 --> 03:09:25.320
MENTIONED FEDERAL TRADE

03:09:25.387 --> 03:09:26.455
COMMISSION GUIDANCE ON DATA

03:09:26.521 --> 03:09:28.190
BROKERS AND HAD DATA BROKERS CAN

03:09:28.256 --> 03:09:30.592
WORK TO DE IDENTIFY INFORMATION

03:09:30.659 --> 03:09:32.027
AND TO PROVIDE DIRECT CHOICES TO

03:09:32.094 --> 03:09:32.861
CONSUMERS AND THAT'S WHY

03:09:32.928 --> 03:09:34.563
COMPANIES LIKE AXIOM ALREADY DO

03:09:34.629 --> 03:09:35.097
THAT.

03:09:35.163 --> 03:09:36.264
AND PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THEIR

03:09:36.331 --> 03:09:38.133
WEBSITE EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT

03:09:38.200 --> 03:09:39.768
CONSUMER FACING IN ORDER THE

03:09:39.835 --> 03:09:42.037
CONSUMERS CAN OBTAIN THAT KIND

03:09:42.104 --> 03:09:44.372
OF INFORMATION.

03:09:44.439 --> 03:09:45.841
WHERE WE GOING IN THE FUTURE

03:09:45.907 --> 03:09:47.275
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN --

03:09:47.342 --> 03:09:49.611
IT IT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE THAT

03:09:49.678 --> 03:09:51.847
THIS YEAR AND PROBABLY FOR MANY

03:09:51.913 --> 03:09:53.682
YEARS TO COME YOU'RE GONNA SEE

03:09:53.749 --> 03:09:55.917
CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES.

03:09:55.984 --> 03:09:57.419
SPENDING THEIR TIME AND THEIR

03:09:57.486 --> 03:09:59.454
MONEY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW

03:09:59.521 --> 03:10:00.989
TO IMPLEMENT THIS LAW TRYING TO

03:10:01.056 --> 03:10:02.557
FIGURE OUT WHERE ALL THIS DATA

03:10:02.624 --> 03:10:03.125
IS AND REMEMBER IT'S ALL THE

03:10:03.191 --> 03:10:04.726
DATA.

03:10:04.793 --> 03:10:05.961
CONNECTED WITH CONSUMERS

03:10:06.027 --> 03:10:07.529
CONNECTED WITH HOUSEHOLDS

03:10:07.596 --> 03:10:08.930
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ASSUME

03:10:08.997 --> 03:10:10.599
IT CAN BE IDENTIFIED IF THE

03:10:10.665 --> 03:10:12.033
DEFINITION IS CAPABLE OF BEING

03:10:12.100 --> 03:10:13.969
IDENTIFIED CAPABLE OF BEING

03:10:14.035 --> 03:10:15.270
ASSOCIATED WITH.

03:10:15.337 --> 03:10:16.371
AND I WANT TO KNOW BECAUSE I SAW

03:10:16.438 --> 03:10:17.305
IT SOMEWHERE AND I JUST WANNA

03:10:17.372 --> 03:10:18.907
MAKE SURE THAT I NOTED THAT DOES

03:10:18.974 --> 03:10:20.208
NOT COME OUT OF EXISTING

03:10:20.275 --> 03:10:21.243
CALIFORNIA LAW.

03:10:21.309 --> 03:10:23.712
THERE IS SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT

03:10:23.779 --> 03:10:25.947
POINT I THINK IT'S EIGHT OH OR

03:10:26.014 --> 03:10:26.615
SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT'S BEEN

03:10:26.681 --> 03:10:28.116
SIGHTED IN SOME THE MATERIALS

03:10:28.183 --> 03:10:29.785
THAT RELATES TO THE DISPOSAL Là

03:10:29.851 --> 03:10:31.119
UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW.

03:10:31.186 --> 03:10:32.420
THAT DEFINITION THAT BROAD

03:10:32.487 --> 03:10:33.421
DEFINITION OF PERSONAL

03:10:33.488 --> 03:10:34.956
INFORMATION CAPABLE OF BEING

03:10:35.023 --> 03:10:36.091
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT ONLY

03:10:36.158 --> 03:10:38.026
RELATES TO DATA DISPOSAL IT IS

03:10:38.093 --> 03:10:40.162
NOT AN EXISTING LAW.

03:10:40.228 --> 03:10:41.863
IT IS NOT CONNECTED TO FOR

03:10:41.930 --> 03:10:43.031
EXAMPLE THE BREACH NOTIFICATION

03:10:43.098 --> 03:10:44.366
LAWS WERE SHINE THE LIGHT LAW OR

03:10:44.432 --> 03:10:46.334
ANY OF THOSE OTHER THINGS SO I

03:10:46.401 --> 03:10:47.936
JUST WANTED TO SPELL THAT MATH.

03:10:48.003 --> 03:10:48.637
THIS IS GONNA BE A HUGE

03:10:48.703 --> 03:10:50.071
UNDERTAKING FOR CALIFORNIA

03:10:50.138 --> 03:10:51.139
BUSINESSES.

03:10:51.206 --> 03:10:52.707
THE PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR THOSE

03:10:52.774 --> 03:10:54.176
BUSINESSES THOSE ARE THE SAME

03:10:54.242 --> 03:10:55.811
CONSUMERS WERE TRYING TO PROTECT

03:10:55.877 --> 03:10:57.979
SO THEY ARE BOTH CONSUMERS.

03:10:58.046 --> 03:10:59.881
WHO WE DO NEED TO PROTECT I WANT

03:10:59.948 --> 03:11:01.316
TO CHECK MY KIDS MY PARENTS

03:11:01.383 --> 03:11:02.317
PEOPLE DON'T UDERSTAND THE

03:11:02.384 --> 03:11:03.185
TECHNOLOGY AS WELL I WANT TO

03:11:03.251 --> 03:11:05.086
EDUCATE CONSUMERS ON WHAT THEIR

03:11:05.153 --> 03:11:06.588
EXACT EXISTING RATES ARE?

03:11:06.655 --> 03:11:07.956
BECAUSE WE SHOULD BE DOING THAT.

03:11:08.023 --> 03:11:10.992
AND DO THAT THE CALIFORNIA

03:11:11.059 --> 03:11:12.294
OFFICE OF PRIVACY PROTECTION

03:11:12.360 --> 03:11:12.994
THAT USED TO EXIST DOESN'T

03:11:13.061 --> 03:11:14.563
ANYMORE DID A FANTASTIC JOB OF

03:11:14.629 --> 03:11:15.864
PROVIDING GUIDANCE TO BUSINESSES

03:11:15.931 --> 03:11:16.431
AND CONSUMERS.

03:11:16.498 --> 03:11:18.300
WE SHOULD DO THAT.

03:11:18.366 --> 03:11:20.035
BUT WE ALSO REMEMBER THOSE

03:11:20.101 --> 03:11:21.436
PEOPLE OF DROPS IN THE

03:11:21.503 --> 03:11:23.071
BUSINESSES THAT ARE IMPACTED BY

03:11:23.138 --> 03:11:24.372
THIS LAW AND WHO ARE GOING TO

03:11:24.439 --> 03:11:25.640
HAVE.

03:11:25.707 --> 03:11:27.075
TO TURN THEMSELVES UPSIDE DOWN

03:11:27.142 --> 03:11:28.210
POSSIBLY GO OUT OF BUSINESS IF

03:11:28.276 --> 03:11:29.544
THEY GET STUDENT TO THE PRIVATE

03:11:29.611 --> 03:11:31.313
RIGHT OF ACTION. FOR NOT HAVING

03:11:31.379 --> 03:11:32.914
QUOTE REASONABLE SECURITY WHEN

03:11:32.981 --> 03:11:34.749
THEY CAN'T EVEN ACCOMPLISH THAT

03:11:34.816 --> 03:11:35.283
AND THEY GET STUCK WITH A

03:11:35.350 --> 03:11:36.117
FISHING ATTACK.

03:11:36.184 --> 03:11:37.352
THOSE PEOPLE GONNA LOSE THEIR

03:11:37.419 --> 03:11:38.620
JOBS BECAUSE OF COMPANIES ARE

03:11:38.687 --> 03:11:39.821
GONNA GO OUT OF BUSINESS OR

03:11:39.888 --> 03:11:40.455
THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO DO

03:11:40.522 --> 03:11:41.356
WHAT THEY NEED TO DO THEY'RE

03:11:41.423 --> 03:11:42.791
GONNA HAVE TO RE ASSIGN

03:11:42.858 --> 03:11:44.392
RESOURCES JUST TO DEAL.

03:11:44.459 --> 03:11:45.660
WITH THE CCPA EVEN IN ITS

03:11:45.727 --> 03:11:46.628
CURRENT FORM.

03:11:46.695 --> 03:11:49.464
SO LET'S USE THE OPPORTUNITY

03:11:49.531 --> 03:11:50.999
THAT WE HAD TO GET IT RIGHT. TO

03:11:51.066 --> 03:11:51.867
TELL PEOPLE ABOUT THE RIGHTS THE

03:11:51.933 --> 03:11:54.870
ALREADY HAVE UNDER EXISTING LAWS

03:11:54.936 --> 03:11:56.371
TO MAKE THIS THE BEST POSSIBLE.

03:11:56.438 --> 03:11:58.773
LEADING STATE LAW IN THE NATION.

03:11:58.840 --> 03:12:02.143
WHICH IT SHOULD BE WITHOUT

03:12:02.210 --> 03:12:03.044
DAMAGING THE ENTIRE CONTENT.

03:12:03.111 --> 03:12:06.047
THANKS VERY MUCH.

03:12:06.114 --> 03:12:08.783
DO YOU HAVE A REAL QUICK WITHOUT

03:12:08.850 --> 03:12:09.751
GET COULD JUST DON'T MAKE MAKE A

03:12:09.818 --> 03:12:11.086
QUICK COMMENT ON THIS POINT

03:12:11.152 --> 03:12:12.454
REGARDING SMALL BUSINESSES AND

03:12:12.520 --> 03:12:15.090
MOM AND POP STORES.

03:12:15.156 --> 03:12:17.025
SO SO.

03:12:17.092 --> 03:12:18.560
IN TODAY'S AGE IT'S RARE TO HAVE

03:12:18.627 --> 03:12:19.594
A BUSINESS THAT MEETS THE

03:12:19.661 --> 03:12:20.729
THRESHOLD THAT DOESN'T HAVE SOME

03:12:20.795 --> 03:12:22.664
ONLINE PRESENCE OF SOME SORT AND

03:12:22.731 --> 03:12:23.531
MORE AND MORE.

03:12:23.598 --> 03:12:25.233
ON AYE COMPANIES ARE USING WEB

03:12:25.300 --> 03:12:26.902
HOSTING CLOUD HOSTING EITHER

03:12:26.968 --> 03:12:29.304
AMAZON WEB SERVICES GOOGLE.

03:12:29.371 --> 03:12:30.906
GOOGLE CLOUD OR EVEN SQUARE

03:12:30.972 --> 03:12:32.407
SPACE OR OR WORDPRESS OR SOME

03:12:32.474 --> 03:12:34.809
SUCH THING AND OFTENTIMES ALL OF

03:12:34.876 --> 03:12:36.111
THESE COMPANIES ALSO GO THROUGH

03:12:36.177 --> 03:12:37.245
THE PROCESS OF WORKING WITH

03:12:37.312 --> 03:12:38.179
ANALYTICS COMPANIES.

03:12:38.246 --> 03:12:39.814
THIRD PARTY DATA BROKERS SO IT'S

03:12:39.881 --> 03:12:41.383
NOT JUST THE BIG TECH COMPANIES

03:12:41.449 --> 03:12:43.184
RIGHT IN A STUDY THAT I DID IN

03:12:43.251 --> 03:12:43.985
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WE FOUND THAT

03:12:44.052 --> 03:12:46.922
GOOGLE WAS PRESENT ON 88% OF THE

03:12:46.988 --> 03:12:47.555
FOUR FIVE OR THOUSAND SITES WE

03:12:47.622 --> 03:12:48.490
SURVEYED.

03:12:48.556 --> 03:12:49.624
ON THE INTERNET AT THAT TIME AND

03:12:49.691 --> 03:12:51.893
THAT NUMBER IS GROUND RIGHT SO

03:12:51.960 --> 03:12:54.229
IT'S SO IT'S SO WHILE WE WE AND

03:12:54.296 --> 03:12:55.997
I HAD ACTUALLY USE THE SHINE THE

03:12:56.064 --> 03:12:57.432
LIGHT NIGHT LIGHT LAW.

03:12:57.499 --> 03:13:02.137
AND I'VE WRITTEN LETTERS TO

03:13:02.203 --> 03:13:02.771
COMPANIES AND I'D RESPONSIBILITY

03:13:02.837 --> 03:13:06.741
SUB THIS KIND OF IN THE NON DATA

03:13:06.808 --> 03:13:08.276
SPACES YOU WOULD CALL IT STILL

03:13:08.343 --> 03:13:09.311
IN THE BUSINESS OF PURCHASING

03:13:09.377 --> 03:13:10.578
DATA ABOUT THE CONSUMERS.

03:13:10.645 --> 03:13:11.680
PURCHASING MEANINGLESS USING

03:13:11.746 --> 03:13:13.415
CLOUD HOSTING USING ANALYTICS SO

03:13:13.481 --> 03:13:14.549
THAT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE

03:13:14.616 --> 03:13:15.650
THAT THAT --

03:13:15.717 --> 03:13:17.519
OF THE COMPANIES THAT THAT ARE

03:13:17.585 --> 03:13:18.820
AFFECTED THOSE ARE ACTUALLY IN

03:13:18.887 --> 03:13:20.255
FACT THE ONES THAT ARE FEEDING

03:18:36.070 --> 03:18:38.139
THE GAP BETWEEN PRACTICE AND

POLICY -- I

03:18:39.807 --> 03:18:42.577

03:18:46.281 --> 03:18:47.448
I THINK IMPROVE AND BILLS IN A

03:19:03.998 --> 03:19:05.400
BOTTOM OF EVERY SCREEN.

03:19:05.466 --> 03:19:07.101
IT REALLY DOESN'T --

03:19:07.168 --> 03:19:09.404
DOES NOT MAKE MUCH SENSE --

03:19:09.470 --> 03:19:12.106
SECONDLY --

03:19:12.173 --> 03:19:13.107

DISCLOSE WHAT THE SOURCES ARE.

03:19:22.717 --> 03:19:23.951

YOU CAN RESOLVE THAT.

03:19:30.658 --> 03:19:31.859

THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA

03:21:55.069 --> 03:21:57.772
SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS --

03:21:57.839 --> 03:21:59.607
AS STATEWIDE ASSOCIATION.

03:21:59.674 --> 03:22:02.009
THE ASSOCIATION HAS ONE CONCERN

03:22:02.076 --> 03:22:04.479
WITH THE LEGISLATION.

03:22:04.545 --> 03:22:05.880
AND WE HAVE A STRAIGHT.

03:22:05.947 --> 03:22:08.049
SOLUTION TO IT --

03:22:08.115 --> 03:22:10.651
CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A NATIONAL

03:22:10.718 --> 03:22:12.320
LEADER AND SO PEOPLE A LIST OF

03:22:12.386 --> 03:22:15.089
PEOPLE IN AB FIFTEEN EIGHTY FOUR

03:22:15.156 --> 03:22:16.324
AND HAS BENEFITTED STUDENTS IN

03:22:16.390 --> 03:22:18.059
CALIFORNIA AND THROUGHOUT THE

03:22:18.125 --> 03:22:19.894
COUNTRY WITH SO MANY STATES

03:22:19.961 --> 03:22:21.629
ADOPT IN IT.

03:22:21.696 --> 03:22:23.564
THOSE PROTECTIONS AND EXISTING

03:22:23.631 --> 03:22:26.267
WEB OF REGULATIONS AND FEDERAL

03:22:26.334 --> 03:22:28.603
MANDATES REGARDING OF RECORD

03:22:28.669 --> 03:22:30.204
RETENTION FOR BOTH STUDENTS AND

03:22:30.271 --> 03:22:32.206
EMPLOYEES HAS RESULTED AND A

03:22:32.273 --> 03:22:34.575
VERY WELL ORGANIZED --

03:22:34.642 --> 03:22:38.412
AND DETAILED STATUTORY STRUCTURE.

03:22:38.479 --> 03:22:40.548
WHAT WERE WORRIED ABOUT IS THAT

03:22:40.615 --> 03:22:43.951
CCPA HAS BLURRY BOUNDARIES

03:22:44.018 --> 03:22:47.088
BETWEEN ITS STATUTORY MANDATES

03:22:47.154 --> 03:22:49.090
AN EXISTING STATUTORY MANDATES

03:22:49.156 --> 03:22:50.858
UNDER AB FIFTEEN EIGHTY FOUR AND

03:22:50.925 --> 03:22:52.360
SO PEOPLE WE THINK THE ENTER

03:22:52.426 --> 03:22:53.528
SACKED?

03:22:53.594 --> 03:22:54.962
WE THINK THAT THIS WILL LEAD TO

03:22:55.029 --> 03:22:57.265
CONFUSION AND IT MAY END UP

03:22:57.331 --> 03:23:00.601
WATERING DOWN AB FIFTEEN EIGHTY

03:23:00.668 --> 03:23:02.069

03:23:02.136 --> 03:23:02.770
WAYS.

03:23:02.837 --> 03:23:05.907
WHICH WOULD BE IRONIC BECAUSE WE

03:23:05.973 --> 03:23:09.010
WORLD OF STUDENT RECORDS IN MY

03:23:09.076 --> 03:23:11.512
VIEW SUBPOENA AND AB FIFTEEN

03:23:11.579 --> 03:23:12.580

03:23:12.647 --> 03:23:15.216
PROTECTIONS TO THE CCPA ON THE

03:23:15.283 --> 03:23:16.751
SAME SUBJECTS.

03:23:16.817 --> 03:23:19.820
WE THINK THAT THESE OVERLAPS.

03:23:19.887 --> 03:23:21.422
AND CONCERNS CAN BE ADDRESSED

03:23:21.489 --> 03:23:23.424
WITH SIMPLE EDITING INDICATING

03:23:23.491 --> 03:23:25.259
THAT RECORDS WITHIN SCHOOL

03:23:25.326 --> 03:23:27.695
DISTRICT CONTROL WILL BE

03:23:27.762 --> 03:23:29.330
REGULATED BY FOR THE AND THE

03:23:29.397 --> 03:23:30.498
EXISTING --

03:23:30.565 --> 03:23:34.302
STATUTORY STRUCTURE THANK YOU

03:23:34.368 --> 03:23:36.437

NONPROFIT ALLIANCE OF LAST YEAR

03:23:39.440 --> 03:23:41.642
THE CCPA THE LEGISLATURE VERY

03:23:41.709 --> 03:23:42.476
THOUGHTFUL.

03:23:42.543 --> 03:23:45.112
IN EXEMPTING NON PROFITS FROM

03:23:45.179 --> 03:23:47.081
THE LAW HOWEVER NONPROFITS IS

03:23:47.148 --> 03:23:48.716
IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER WE DO NOT

03:23:48.783 --> 03:23:51.118
OPERATE IN A VACUUM WE HAVE TO

03:23:51.185 --> 03:23:53.588

OUR PROGRAMMATIC MISSIONS.

03:23:58.659 --> 03:24:01.362
IF DATA BECOMES TOO EXPENSIVE

03:24:01.429 --> 03:24:02.997
TOO DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN THERE

03:24:03.064 --> 03:24:04.899
ARE REAL AND TRUE CONSEQUENCES

03:24:04.966 --> 03:24:05.700
AND THE NONPROFIT ALLIANCE

03:24:05.766 --> 03:24:06.634
BELIEVES.

03:24:06.701 --> 03:24:08.202
THAT IN FACT BECAUSE WE DO NOT

03:24:08.269 --> 03:24:09.971
HAVE A PROFIT MARGIN WE DO NOT

03:24:10.037 --> 03:24:11.606

03:24:15.943 --> 03:24:17.878
OF THE COST PRESSURES ASSOCIATED

03:24:17.945 --> 03:24:21.415
WITH THE CCPA IF IT REMAINS.

03:24:21.482 --> 03:24:22.683

03:24:23.618 --> 03:24:26.153
WE LOOK AT AREAS THAT --

03:24:26.220 --> 03:24:27.755
PUT A LOT OF COST PRESSURES ON

03:24:27.822 --> 03:24:29.390
THOSE WHO ARE DIRECTLY IMPACTED.

03:24:29.457 --> 03:24:32.226
BY IMPLEMENTING THE CCPA --

03:24:32.293 --> 03:24:35.396
THINGS FOR EXAMPLE TIONS BROAD

03:24:35.463 --> 03:24:37.732
CATEGORIES IF WE CAN NARROW IT

03:24:37.798 --> 03:24:39.400
AND CLARIFY IT WE'RE HOPING THAT

03:24:39.467 --> 03:24:40.935
THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO

03:24:41.002 --> 03:24:43.037
MITIGATING SOME OF THE COST

03:24:43.104 --> 03:24:43.337
PRESSURES.

03:24:43.404 --> 03:24:45.473
WE ARE ALSO VERY CONCERNED ABOUT
