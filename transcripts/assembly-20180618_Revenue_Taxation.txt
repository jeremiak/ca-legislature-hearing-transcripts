AS MIDNIGHT TWENTY FOUR IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TOWARDS REWARDING THEIR FORTITUDE [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] ANY QUESTIONS. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. I DON'T WELL WE'LL TAKE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION IN THE MODE ASK FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE IF THAT'S WHEN IT WHEN I OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE DOCTOR QUIRK. SO MY PROBLEM WITH THIS IN ANY OTHER BILL THAT RELIES ON DEDUCTIONS. IS THAT PEOPLE MAKE VERY LITTLE MONEY. WILL GET NO BENEFIT. BUT IF YOU FOR EXAMPLE HAVE A SPOUSE MAKING A COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND A YEAR. YOU GET A LARGE BENEFIT. BECAUSE YOU'RE IN A HIGH TAX BRACKET. SO THIS HELPS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE RICH THE MOST AND THE POOR THE LEAST. AND I JUST DON'T THINK THAT'S THE WAY TO DO IT I THINK IF YOU REALLY WANTED TO HELP THESE FOLKS. ANOTHER WAY TO DO THIS WOULD BE TO GET A LINE ON IT IN THE BUDGET. SIMPLY SAY ARM SHE YOU KNOW THESE PEOPLE ARE CALLED UP BY THE GOVERNOR. WILL PAY THEM SOME ADDITIONAL AMOUNT WHILE THEY'RE ON DUTY. THEN YOU'D BE HELPING EVERYBODY THE SAME. BUT HERE YOU'RE HELPING THE RICH THE MOST SO I JUST CAN'T SUPPORT IT HOOK THAT. THAT'S A THAT'S OKAY I JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE YEAR EMPIRICAL DATA WILL COME FROM THE SAY THESE PEOPLE ARE RATCHET IF THEY'RE KINDA SPREAD. OVER BUT THEY'RE CERTAINLY NOT. NO BUT SOME OF THEM WERE RICH SOME OF THEM ARE MAKING A GOOD INCOME THERE MAKING GOOD INCOME ON THEIR OWN JOBS THEIR SPOUSES YOU'RE MAKING GOOD INCOME. THERE IN A HIGH TAX BRACKET THEY WOULD GET A VERY LARGE BENEFIT SOMETHING LIKE TEN TWELVE AND WHERE IS SOMEBODY WHO MAKES VERY LOW INCOME? WE GET ALMOST NO BENEFIT OR PERHAPS NO BENEFIT. SO YOU'RE YOU'RE HELPING THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING A LOT OF MONEY A LOT IN THE PEOPLE WHO AREN'T MAKING MUCH MONEY. YOU'RE REALLY NOT HELPING AT ALL WHERE YOU ARE. PEOPLE MAKE LESS MONEY IF YOU HELP THEM A LITTLE BIT IT HELPS BUT I I CAN CARRY REALLY NOT BEAT THEM AND I PAY TAXES AT ALL OR IF THEY DO WHICH IS. 234% WERE IS PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING A LOT OF MONEY 101213% THAT'S MY PROBLEM WITH THE BILL NO PROBLEM AYE CHOQUET. THANKS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- MISTER MARONEY THINK YOU FOR BILLING BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD -- EIGHT AND I DO IT. I DON'T I HAVING SERVED -- IN THE MILITARY HAVING HAS BEEN NOT THE NATIONAL GUARD BUT IN YOU KNOW STRAIGHT ACTIVE DUTY -- AND HAVING HAD OPPORTUNITIES -- TO TO WORK WITH NATIONAL GUARDSMEN AND WOMEN -- I JUST WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MY GOOD FRIEND -- FROM HAND VERDE THINK. HAYWARD SORRY HAYWARD -- I DON'T KNOW A LOT OF MEN GUARDSMEN WHO ARE WEALTHY -- THEIR THEIR WHAT THEIR SPOUSE MAY HAVE -- A DECENT PAYING JOB BUT I THINK TO HIS POINTS. IT'S GOING TO HELP EVERYBODY EVERY LITTLE BIT DOES HELPING AND ALSO I THINK PEOPLE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT. WHEN YOU WHEN YOU GET RECALLED TO ACTIVE DUTY -- YOUR CIVILIAN PAY GOES AWAY. SO IT'S NOT AS THOUGH YOU'RE BRINGING IN -- THE BIG BUCKS WHILE YOU'RE YOU KNOW BEING DEPLOYED FOR THE STATE -- SO. WITH WITHOUT I THINK I'D LIKE TO SECOND THE MOTION I UNDERSTAND THERE WASN'T ONE I'M JUST TELL YOU THANK YOU FOR BRINGING FOR THE BILL. THANK YOU APPRECIATE THEM.

BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS ARMED IN OUR EXCEPT THE AMENDMENTS MADAM CHAIR OF COURSE. BUT IT WAVES STATE LOCAL TAXES FOR CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS IN IN WHAT THIS RELATES TO IS THIS ARM. ISSUE OF AT CAMP PENDLETON OF THIS -- VETERANS FACILITY AND HISTORICALLY FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PAYS THE PROPERTY TO AND IT PAYS FOR THE COSTS AND AS A RESULT TO EXEMPT FROM THE TAXES IN THIS INSTANCE. THIS FACILITY WAS BUILT BY NOT FOR PROFIT ENTITY ARE THE INITIAL BE MEASURE ASKED FOR RETROACTIVITY AT THE REQUEST OF THE CHAIR AND HER BRILLIANT STAFF -- JOKING -- STEATITE THE THE WE WE'VE EXCEPT IT WASN'T MUCH TO GO FORWARD AS OPPOSED TO RETROACTIVE HE'S ME MADAM CHAIR WE HAVE A RULE AGAINST US.

ALCOHOL GOOD SENATOR ALL THANKS CHAIRED BY HANDS RIGHT BUT IT'S A TYPICALLY -- CENTER THANKS SO MUCH FOR ME AS FOR HOUSE INVOLVED IN THAT BILL LAST YEAR WITH THE INTREPID FALLEN HEROES FUND RIGHT NOW BUILT THE BRAIN INJURY CENTER ON CAMPUS AND WE'RE LOOKING AT A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN ITS TO EXEMPT. THEM AT THE CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS TO BUILD THIS FACILITY. AND I THINK IT'S ADMIRABLE THAT YOU HAVE A NONPROFIT RAISING PRIVATE DOLLARS AND THEY'RE GONNA TURN OF SILLY OR THE GOVERNMENT ANSWER IT WAS A SHAME I GOT CAUGHT IN. AN ASSEMBLY SPECIALIZED HERE BUT THANKS FOR CHAMPION AND AND OBVIOUSLY GOT MY SPORT SURE THANK YOU TIME AND AND IT REALLY IS. IT ONLY DEALS WITH DEPARTMENT DEFENSE ISSUES IS QUITE LIMITED I UNDERSTAND THE POLICY ISSUES AROUND THIS BECAUSE I CHAIR THE TAX COMMITTEE. IN THE OTHER HOUSE -- SO BUT I THINK THAT THIS IS AN EXCEPTION THAT MAKES SOME SENSE. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE A DUCT WORK. BY. SO MY CONCERN IS AND IT MAY BE THAT IT'S FIXED IN THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN. THAT SOMEBODY ARM. THE CONTRACTOR COULD BUY A LOT OF EQUIPMENT. IT'S BEING USED ON MULTIPLE SITES. BUT BECAUSE THEY'RE BUYING THEM AT THE TIME THEY HAVE THIS CONTRACT THAT THEY MIGHT -- JUST DECIDE TO BUY WHAT THEY NEED FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS SO -- THAT WAS A CONCERN I HAVE IN THE BILL IF YOU'RE EXCLUDING THEM FROM ALL SALES TAXES OPPOSED TO JUST THINGS THAT GO INTO THE BUILDING. AND I COULDN'T TELL FROM THE BILL AND PERHAPS THE CHAIR CAN. CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT MACHINERY THAT WAS PURCHASED AT THAT TIME AND MIGHT BE USED IN OTHER -- PROJECTS WAS EXEMPT AND THAT THAT'S A KEY QUESTION I HAVE YEAH. IF ARGUMENT TO THE CHAIR INSISTS QUESTION BASICALLY THE MEASURE SAYS THAT THE EXEMPTION IS LIMITED TO UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE PURCHASES. AND VETERAN AFFAIRS THAT ARE QUALIFIED NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT IT IDENTIFIES QUALIFIED FACILITY THE QUALIFIED NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION. THAT HAS TO DONATE. THE ASSET TO THE DEPARTMENT DEFENSE PURSUANT TO SECTION OF UNITED STATES CODE OR THE TH DEPARTMENT OFFENSE I THINK IT'S PRETTY NARROW. FAIR QUESTION OPENING QUESTION BUT IT'S PRETTY NEARLY CRAFTED OKAY SO THE AND THE HAD IT THAT THAT WOULD MEAN THAT I THINK I TO DATE HAVE TO DONATE THE EQUIPMENT AS WELL. IN ORDER TO GET THE TAX EXEMPTION THEY COULD USE THE EQUIPMENT LATER. CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT AYE AYE OFFICE IT BUT I THINK THEY CAN GET UP THEY BUY IT OR DOES ARE BUT ARE GONNA CERTAINLY DON'T EVERYTHING GETS DONATED THAT'S HOW CARRIE BEHIND IT AND THE GHOST THE NONPROFIT AND THAT'S THE ONLY REASON THEY GET THE EXEMPTION SURE. OKAY AND THE GUYS DON'T TELL GOVERNOR AND MY CONCERN I'LL BE UPLOADING AYE. THANK YOU SIR. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THAT'S WHAT I DON'T THINK SO MUCH THINK YOU AND THANK YOU SENATOR FOR WORKING WITH US ON THE AMENDMENTS -- THE AUTHOR HAS AGREED TO MAKE THE EXEMPTION PROSPECTIVE BEGINNING AS JANUARY FIRST TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WITHOUT WE HAVE -- DO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS MISSILE WHEN YOU CALL THE ROLL.

GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF. FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL. FOR DECADES THE VOTERS IN THE CITY OF DAY. HAVE APPROVED LOCAL PARCEL TAXES TO FUND THE DAVIS JOINT UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICTS. EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING REAFFIRMING A LOCAL COMMITMENT TO PRIORITIZE IN HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION IN THE COMMITTEE COMMUNITY. S. B. NINE FIFTY EIGHT IS A DISTRICT BILL THAT WOULD AUTHORIZE DAVIS JOINT UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT TO ALLOW PARCEL TAX EXEMPTION. FOR TEACHERS AND SCHOOL EMPLOYEES IN ADDITION TO SSI RECIPIENTS AND SENIORS THAT ALSO RECEIVE A PARCEL TAX-EXEMPTION. THIS BILL WHICH IS SUPPORTED BY THE TEACHERS AND SCHOOL EMPLOYEES PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL INCENTIVE FOR A PUBLIC EDUCATORS AND SCHOOL STAFF TO LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY DAVIS WHERE THEY WORK. AT NO COST TO THE STATE. THIS FINANCIAL BENEFITIS IMPORTANT PARTICULARLY MY THE HIGH COST OF LIVING THE TEACHERS MY SHOULDER IN ORDER TO LIVE NEAR THE PLACE TO WORK WITH ME TODAY IN SUPPORT IS ALLEN FERNANDES. ON BEHALF OF THE BILL SPONSORED DAVIS JOINT UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND BLAIR HOWARD A TEACHER IN THE DAVIS JOINT UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. WHEN IT IS IN SUPPORT GREAT THANK YOU AND THANK YOU AYE MADAM CHAIR ASSEMBLY MEMBERS -- ALLEN FERNANDEZ ON BEHALF OF THE DAVIS JOINT UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WHERE I SERVE AS TRUSTEE. OF MYSELF AND MY FOR THEIR COLLEAGUES ABOUT VOTED. FIVE ZERO TO ASK THE STATE FOR SOME FLEXIBILITY -- WITH OUR LOCAL DOLLARS RAISED BY VIA -- PARCEL TAX -- I I WANNA KIND ADDRESS A COUPLE OF THAT CONCERNS AND QUESTIONS THAT EVERTON IN DISCUSSIONS WITH MANY OF YOUR STAFF. ON FIRST THING IS THIS AS SENATOR DODD INDICATED HAS NO COST TO THE STATE ED AND THE QUESTION OF WHY DON'T YOU USE YOUR GENERAL FUND THIS IS OUT OF OUR GENERAL FUND AND MORE TO THE POINT IT'S OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND THAT DOESN'T COME FROM THE STATE. ALL ON THE OTHER THING IS IS THAT YOU KNOW UP FOR THOSE WHO RIDE DON'T CARE GLORIA EXCEPTION OF ON THAT ON THAT NOTE I WOULD JUST ASK FOR YOUR IVA. AND WE'RE HERE FOR ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU -- MANY AS BLAIR HOWARD AND I'M A CONTINUATION HIGH SCHOOL SOCIAL STUDIES TEACHER AND DAVIS -- IT WAS A DECADES LONG CHALLENGE FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO BUY A HOME. IN THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH I TEACH. I WAS ABLE TO DO BECAUSE THE CITY -- DEVELOP SOME AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND MY INCOME FINALLY IMPROVED ENOUGH. TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD A HOME BUT EVEN WITH ALL THAT. FOR HOME IN DAVIS -- DAVIS'S LONG VALUE TEACHERS AS MEMBERS OF THEIR COMMUNITY WITH EDUCATION TYING THE COMMUNITY TOGETHER IN SO MANY WAYS. LIVING IN TOWN AND NOT COMMUTING TO SCHOOL COMMUTING FROM ANOTHER TOWN THIS ALLOWS ME TO SPEND MORE TIM AT MY SCHOOL. AND WORKING WITH STUDENTS IMPROVING THEIR LEARNING MOST OF WHICH HAVE FALLEN BEHIND IT WOULD NOT EVEN BE ON TRACK TO GRADUATE IF NOT FOR ALL THE SUPPORT TIME WE'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR THEM. UNFORTUNATELY LESS STATE FUNDING COMPARED TO SURROUNDING DISTINCT DISTRICTS HAS LED TO A COMPENSATION GAP COMPARED WITH HIGHER -- PAIRED WITH HIGHER HOME PRICES HAVE PRICED MANY YOUNGER TEACHERS LIKE MYSELF OUT OF BUYING A HOME IN THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH WE SERVE. WE LOSE MANY TEACHERS A YEAR TO THIS DYNAMIC AND CONSISTENTLY NEED TO REPLACE TEACHERS -- AND THE NEED TO CONSISTENTLY REPLACE TEACHERS DISRUPTS STUDENT LEARNING I LOVE TEACHING IN DAVIS AND BEING ABLE TO LIVE IN TOWNS KEPT ME THERE DESPITE KNOWING I COULD MAKE THOUSANDS MORE DOLLARS COMMUTING OR LIVING IN ANOTHER COMMUNITY. BUT I ALSO KNOW MANY TEACHERS THAT HAVE LEFT THROUGH. OUT THE YEARS TO TAKE JOBS CLOSER TO HOME TO COMMUNITIES THAT THEY CAN AFFORD. TO BUY A HOUSE AND BUT THE STATE IS NOT GOING TO ADJUST FUNDING TO ALLOW IT DISTRICT LIKE DAVIS TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN TEACHERS AS MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY. THEN I WOULD ASK FOR THE ABILITY OF THE COMMUNITY OF DAVIS. I CHOOSE WHETHER OR NOT TO PUT MORE MONEY IN THE POCKETS OF TEACHERS -- AND NEED TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY -- IN WHICH THEY LIVE THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR TONY TRIGGER ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION WE FIRST WELL ONE APPRECIATE ALL THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED IN THE ANALYSIS.
