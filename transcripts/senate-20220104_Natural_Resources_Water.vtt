00:14:25.664 --> 00:14:27.833
PUBLIC ACCESS IN CALIFORNIA'S

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.035
COASTAL ECONOMY. LET'S BE CLEAR

00:14:30.102 --> 00:14:31.637
IT'S NOT AS IF THE INGREDIENTS

00:14:31.704 --> 00:14:32.571
PLUS GAVE WAY BECAUSE THE

00:14:32.638 --> 00:14:34.173
COMMISSION DENIED A RETAINING

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.908
WALL THERE. THE COMMISSION IS

00:14:35.975 --> 00:14:36.842
NEVER RECEIVED ANY SUCH

00:14:36.909 --> 00:14:38.644
APPLICATION AT THAT SITE YOUR

00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:40.346
HAS THE COMMISSION EVER DENIED A

00:14:40.412 --> 00:14:41.680
PRIVACY WALL IN THE GENERAL

00:14:41.747 --> 00:14:43.382
AREA. IN FACT BECAUSE NATIVE

00:14:43.449 --> 00:14:46.885
BLASTS ARE ALREADY EXTENSIVELY

00:14:46.952 --> 00:14:49.054
ARMOR- ACCIDENT WAS JUST THAT.

00:14:49.121 --> 00:14:50.923
ACCIDENT NOT THE RESULT OF ANY.

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:53.792
POLICY OR FAILURE TO ACT. BUT

00:14:53.859 --> 00:14:55.127
STILL WILL BE THE MORE SEAWALLS

00:14:55.194 --> 00:14:56.729
INCLUDING REPRAP WHICH MEANS

00:14:56.795 --> 00:14:59.131
MORE COASTAL EROSION NOT LATCH

00:14:59.198 --> 00:15:01.100
THE SCIENCE IS CLEAR HE WON'T

00:15:01.166 --> 00:15:02.801
KILL BEACHES BY CUTTING OFF THE

00:15:02.868 --> 00:15:04.837
CENTRAL ST SUPPLIED. AS BEACHES

INTENSIFIED HE WILL DEFINITELY

00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:10.576
HAVE THEIR PLACE IN SOME

00:15:10.643 --> 00:15:12.344
SITUATIONS CALIFORNIA ALREADY

00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:14.346
HAS OVER A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE

00:15:14.413 --> 00:15:15.614
MILES UP. THE CAN PROVIDE

00:15:15.681 --> 00:15:17.283
IMMEDIATE SHORT TERM PROTECTION

00:15:17.349 --> 00:15:19.918
WHILE OTHER SOLUTIONS ARE-

00:15:19.985 --> 00:15:22.021
ARRIVED ON BUT IT CALIFORNIA'S

00:15:22.087 --> 00:15:23.622
DEADLY TOWARDS SCIENCE BASED

00:15:23.689 --> 00:15:25.257
LONG RANGE REGIONAL PLANNING IN

00:15:25.324 --> 00:15:26.759
NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS MEANWHILE

00:15:26.825 --> 00:15:31.864
SHOULD BE. A LAST RESORT NOT THE

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:32.564
DEFAULT. I T. WOLVES BECAUSE

00:15:32.631 --> 00:15:34.333
ELDER FOR ENOUGH ONE CUMULATIVE

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.935

SCALE IN FAVOR OF C. WALLS

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:41.907
REGARDLESS OF OTHER OPTIONS. THE

00:15:41.974 --> 00:15:43.042
COMMISSION AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:15:43.108 --> 00:15:44.243
WOULD HAVE TO APPROVE THEM BY

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:45.711
RIGHT FOR ANY RESIDENTIAL

00:15:45.778 --> 00:15:46.945
DEVELOPMENTS BELT BEFORE MAY OF

00:15:47.012 --> 00:15:49.615
LAST YEAR. DISCRETION TO DENY

00:15:49.682 --> 00:15:51.183
WOULD BE SEVERELY CONSTRAINED IT

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:53.085
LIMITS MITIGATION TO THE FEET OF

ADEQUATE AMOUNTS THAT WILL NOT

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:00.092
ADDRESS ACTUAL IMPACT. IF

00:16:00.159 --> 00:16:01.393
WEALTHY COAST LIKE POLICIES WILL

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:02.828
MAKE IT FASTER EASIER AND

00:16:02.895 --> 00:16:05.164
CHEAPER TO BUILD THE WALL. BUT

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:07.433
IT WILL BE AT THE COST OF PUBLIC

00:16:07.499 --> 00:16:08.200
BEACHES. THANK YOU MR CHRISTIE

ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEVEL RIDE.

00:16:45.771 --> 00:16:47.072
UNFORTUNATELY BILL IS NOT A

00:16:47.139 --> 00:16:48.440
SHELTER WE SEEK. THE BILL

00:16:48.507 --> 00:16:49.942

TRACKING SEA WALLS THAT NARROW

00:16:52.978 --> 00:16:55.314
BEACHES. A STATE NATIONAL PARK

00:16:55.381 --> 00:16:56.315
IS NOT ONE PAVED OVER WITH

00:16:56.382 --> 00:16:58.584
ASPHALT. IT'S ONE EFFECTIVELY

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:00.919
MANAGED AND CURATED. THE SAME IS

00:17:00.986 --> 00:17:04.189
TRUE FOR OUR LOCAL BLOOD AND

THAT EVER MORE VULNERABLE TO

00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:15.134
EROSION AND WAVERUNNER. BUT IT

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.235
DOESN'T MEAN THAT NOTHING CAN

00:17:16.301 --> 00:17:18.036
DONE. CALIFORNIA CODE STANDS TO

00:17:18.103 --> 00:17:19.671

00:17:30.616 --> 00:17:32.518
A FACT THAT WILL MAKE BLOOD CLAP

00:17:32.584 --> 00:17:33.952
MORE PREDICTABLE. AND BRIDGES

00:17:40.659 --> 00:17:42.294

KNOW IT'S NOT JUST THE

00:21:33.025 --> 00:21:34.559
LEGISLATION THAT WAS PASSED LAST

00:21:34.626 --> 00:21:35.827
YEAR FROM SOME MEMBER

00:21:35.894 --> 00:21:37.596
BOERNER HORVATH THEIR ATKINS ARE

00:21:37.663 --> 00:21:38.964
PETRIE-NORRIS OR YEARS ELLIS

00:21:39.031 --> 00:21:40.866
ADVOCATE HERE IN CENTER BATES.

00:21:40.932 --> 00:21:42.634
BUT ALSO FEDERAL ACTION IS

00:21:42.701 --> 00:21:44.269
PENDING WITH THE ARMY CORPS OF

00:21:44.336 --> 00:21:46.805
ENGINEERS LOOKING AT A- A BEACH

00:21:46.872 --> 00:21:49.207
NOURISHMENT PROJECT- AND LOOKING

00:21:49.274 --> 00:21:51.209
AT A LONG TERM PLAN FOR THAT

00:21:51.276 --> 00:21:54.012
ENTIRE REGION- I THINK THAT YOUR

00:21:54.079 --> 00:21:55.580
VOICE IS BEING HEARD- WELL

00:21:55.647 --> 00:21:57.716
BEYOND YOUR COMMUNITY AND I DO

00:21:57.783 --> 00:21:59.151
WANT TO THANK YOU FOR IT. I'M

00:21:59.217 --> 00:22:01.520
SORRY THAT- WE'RE STILL LOOKING

00:22:01.586 --> 00:22:03.689
AT THE SAME BILL WE HAD A

00:22:03.755 --> 00:22:05.023
PRESENTED TO THE COMMITTEE LAST

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:06.658
YEAR BECAUSE I DO THINK THERE'S

00:22:06.725 --> 00:22:09.428
WORK TO BE DONE. ON A BEACH

00:22:09.494 --> 00:22:11.830
REPLENISHMENT AND IN CERTAIN-

00:22:11.897 --> 00:22:13.665
TARGETED CIRCUMSTANCES SHORELINE

00:22:13.732 --> 00:22:15.267
PROTECTIVE DEVICES MAY MAKE

00:22:15.333 --> 00:22:18.670
SENSE- BUT THE SORT OF. HEAVY

00:22:18.737 --> 00:22:21.840
HANDED IN- SINGLE SHOT APPROACH

00:22:21.907 --> 00:22:24.843
TO THIS IS A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE.

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:26.411
TO ME POSES SOME SERIOUS

00:22:26.478 --> 00:22:28.413
CONCERNS FOR EXACTLY THE REASONS

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.582
WE'RE HERE TO SOLVE- WHEN IT

00:22:30.649 --> 00:22:34.252
COMES TO- ONE RIVET REVETMENT

00:22:34.319 --> 00:22:35.687
FOR SHORELINE PROTECTIVE DEVICE

00:22:35.754 --> 00:22:37.889
BEING PUT IN ONE AREA WHAT

00:22:37.956 --> 00:22:38.857
HAPPENS TO THE AREA RIGHT NEXT

00:22:38.924 --> 00:22:41.526
TO THAT. DEVICE DOES THIS THE

00:22:41.593 --> 00:22:43.862
SAND GETS SUCKED AWAY AND-

00:22:43.929 --> 00:22:45.430
PULLED SOMEWHERE ELSE WE'VE SEEN

00:22:45.497 --> 00:22:47.399
NUMEROUS STUDIES ON THAT THE

00:22:47.466 --> 00:22:48.533
PROLIFERATION OF SEA WALLS

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.001
WITHOUT INDICATED INADEQUATE.

00:22:50.068 --> 00:22:52.437
MANY MEDICATION WITHOUT A

00:22:52.504 --> 00:22:54.606
PROCESS FOR COASTAL COMMISSION

00:22:54.673 --> 00:22:55.607
FOR STATE AGENCIES THROUGH

00:22:55.674 --> 00:22:58.510
SEQUEL TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS-

00:22:58.577 --> 00:23:01.012
SEEMS TO ME A RASH APPROACH TO A

00:23:01.079 --> 00:23:02.914
VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT SHOT

00:23:02.981 --> 00:23:06.852
NOT BE- RUSH THROUGH THE PROCESS

00:23:06.918 --> 00:23:08.820
BUT INSTEAD DELIBERATED ON SO.

00:23:08.887 --> 00:23:11.957
YOU KNOW I DO HAVE SERIOUS

00:23:12.023 --> 00:23:13.125
CONCERNS ABOUT THE LEAD SOLUTION

00:23:13.191 --> 00:23:15.627
I WISH WE ATTACK- DONE REAL WORK

00:23:15.694 --> 00:23:17.462
HERE AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT

00:23:17.529 --> 00:23:18.764
TO WORK WITH WITHIN THE EXISTING

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:19.798
STATUTORY FRAMEWORK THAT WAS

00:23:19.865 --> 00:23:22.701
PASSED LAST YEAR SO- THOSE ARE

00:23:22.768 --> 00:23:24.436
MY INITIAL COMMENTS I WON'T BE

00:23:24.503 --> 00:23:26.204
SUPPORTING THE MEASURE TODAY-

00:23:26.271 --> 00:23:27.539
BUT I DO THINK THERE'S SERIOUS

00:23:27.606 --> 00:23:29.074
WORK TO GET DONE. BOTH WITHIN

00:23:29.141 --> 00:23:30.609
THE FEDERAL ARMY CORPS FRAMEWORK

00:23:30.675 --> 00:23:32.244
IN THE THREE BILLS PASSED LAST

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:33.945
YEAR BUT I WOULD OPEN IT UP TO.

00:23:34.012 --> 00:23:35.113
FURTHER DISCUSSION OR COMMENTS

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:37.649
OR QUESTIONS MEMBERS- CERTAINLY

00:23:37.716 --> 00:23:41.787
DO APPRECIATE ANY FEEDBACK- YES

00:23:41.853 --> 00:23:43.388
CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU CENTER

00:23:43.455 --> 00:23:46.391
BATES- THE OBVIOUS I LIVE NEARBY

00:23:46.458 --> 00:23:48.693
THIS SITUATION AND YOUR DISTRICT

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.263
BUT I'M NOT TOO FAR AWAY MYSELF

00:23:51.329 --> 00:23:53.231
AND I REMEMBER. THE NEWS THAT'S

00:23:53.298 --> 00:23:55.233
US REMEMBER SEVERAL YEARS AGO-

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:56.935
THAT THIS LEGISLATURE TOOK UP

00:23:57.002 --> 00:23:58.937
SOME ISSUES REGARDING BALCONIES

00:23:59.004 --> 00:24:00.872
WHEN THERE WAS SOME BALCONY

00:24:00.939 --> 00:24:04.776
COLLAPSES IN- IN- BERKELEY AND-

00:24:04.843 --> 00:24:07.712
THE LEGISLATURE ACTED QUICKLY-

00:24:07.779 --> 00:24:09.714
THERE WAS A LOT OF DEBATE ON.

00:24:09.781 --> 00:24:11.817
WHETHER THE ACTUAL LEGISLATION

00:24:11.883 --> 00:24:14.186
WAS GONNA MAKE A DIFFERENCE BUT-

00:24:14.252 --> 00:24:15.187
THE BOTTOM LINE WAS THE

00:24:15.253 --> 00:24:17.656
LEGISLATURE CHOSE TO ACT QUICKLY

00:24:17.722 --> 00:24:19.991
AND PASS SOME LEGISLATION. THAT

00:24:20.058 --> 00:24:21.259
WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THAT

00:24:21.326 --> 00:24:22.527
AND I THINK THIS LEGISLATURE

00:24:22.594 --> 00:24:24.029
TODAY HAS AN OPTION TO SAME

00:24:24.095 --> 00:24:28.033
THING IN THIS SITUATION- AND YOU

00:24:28.099 --> 00:24:29.167
KNOW THE COULD THE COASTAL

00:24:29.234 --> 00:24:31.102
COMMISSION. MY UNDERSTANDING

00:24:31.169 --> 00:24:32.304
THEIR CHARTERS TO PROTECT THE

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:35.173
COAST OF CALIFORNIA. AND THIS IS

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:36.308
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE COASTAL

00:24:36.374 --> 00:24:38.376
COMMISSION TO STEP UP AND TAKE

00:24:38.443 --> 00:24:41.847
THE LEAD ON THIS. AND ACTUALLY-

00:24:41.913 --> 00:24:45.016
RATHER THAN JUST. A COME OUT

00:24:45.083 --> 00:24:48.019
AGAINST THIS BILL WITH. MAY BE A

00:24:48.086 --> 00:24:49.688
PROPER ARGUMENTS ARE NOT PROPER

00:24:49.754 --> 00:24:51.289
ARGUMENTS WILL LEAVE THAT FOR

00:24:51.356 --> 00:24:53.458
FURTHER DEBATE AS THE CHAIRMAN.

00:24:53.525 --> 00:24:57.729
HI COMMENTED BUT- TO JUST COME

00:24:57.796 --> 00:25:00.498
OUT OUT OUT OF OUT OF HAND. TO

00:25:00.565 --> 00:25:03.935
OPPOSE THIS- SEEMS AGAINST THE

00:25:04.002 --> 00:25:06.338
CHARTER AND THE PURPOSE OF THE

00:25:06.404 --> 00:25:07.205
COASTAL COMMISSION IN THE FIRST

00:25:07.272 --> 00:25:08.907
PLACE I MEAN THEIR THEIR JOB IS

00:25:08.974 --> 00:25:10.976
TO PROTECT THE COAST AND THIS IS

00:25:11.042 --> 00:25:12.510
AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT- I

00:25:12.577 --> 00:25:14.913
KNOW I JUST WONDER IF. THOSE

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:17.115
COASTAL RIDGELINES WERE

00:25:17.182 --> 00:25:19.951
POPULATED BY ENDANGERED SPECIES

00:25:20.018 --> 00:25:21.186
HOW MUCH WOULD THE COASTAL

00:25:21.253 --> 00:25:23.288
COMMISSION APPROVED TO PROTECT

00:25:23.355 --> 00:25:26.024
THAT RATHER THAN- WHAT WE'RE

00:25:26.091 --> 00:25:27.893
LOOKING AT HERE TODAY SO WITH

00:25:27.959 --> 00:25:29.060
THAT I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE

00:25:29.127 --> 00:25:30.695
BILL AND MAKE THE MOTION FOR

00:25:30.762 --> 00:25:33.965
APPROVAL AND- HOPE THAT- ENOUGH

00:25:34.032 --> 00:25:36.768
MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE WILL-

00:25:36.835 --> 00:25:38.904
FOLLOW WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:40.405
HERE. AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR

00:25:40.472 --> 00:25:42.340
CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU. THANK

00:25:42.407 --> 00:25:44.175
YOU MR VICE CHAIR- COME HERE

CENTER HUESO AND THEN OVER TO

00:25:46.678 --> 00:25:47.779
CENTER THERE. OF THE FIRST

00:25:47.846 --> 00:25:53.285
INTERNATIONAL. THE THANK YOU

00:25:53.351 --> 00:25:55.220
MISTER AND THANK YOU SENATOR

00:25:55.287 --> 00:26:00.825
WORKS ON I THINK THE DEBATE- ME

00:26:00.892 --> 00:26:02.060
LIES A LITTLE WHAT THE ACTUAL

00:26:02.127 --> 00:26:05.297
SITUATION IS AND IF THERE WAS A

00:26:05.363 --> 00:26:06.831
BALCONY BILLS STRENGTHENING ONE

00:26:06.898 --> 00:26:08.400
BALCONY DIDN'T AUTOMATICALLY WE

00:26:08.466 --> 00:26:10.502
CAN THE NEXT BALCONY THAT IS

00:26:10.568 --> 00:26:12.537
WHAT IS IN FRONT OF US HERE AND

00:26:12.604 --> 00:26:14.506
WHAT IS IN FRONT OF US HERE. IS

00:26:14.572 --> 00:26:17.809
THE FACT THAT THIS IS DE FACTO

00:26:17.876 --> 00:26:18.944
BY BROUGHT. UP FOR THE

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:22.881
CONSTRUCTION OF FORMER. AND I

00:26:22.948 --> 00:26:26.818
HAVE A LENGTHY COASTAL DISTRICT

00:26:26.885 --> 00:26:28.153
- THAT RUNS HUNDREDS OF MILES

00:26:28.219 --> 00:26:30.288
ALONG THE COAST AND IT'S- IT'S

00:26:30.355 --> 00:26:31.589
INTERESTING BECAUSE THERE IS ONE

00:26:31.656 --> 00:26:33.425
PLACE WHERE THERE IS A STRONG

00:26:33.491 --> 00:26:36.628
SEA WALL. AND AS A RESULT THE

00:26:36.695 --> 00:26:38.263
RESIDENTIAL APARTMENT THAT IS

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:39.564
RIGHT NEARBY HAS BEEN

00:26:39.631 --> 00:26:41.766
SUBSTANTIALLY UNDERMINED AND

00:26:41.833 --> 00:26:42.767
THEY ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

00:26:42.834 --> 00:26:44.402
HOW TO PROTECT ALL THE PEOPLE IN

00:26:44.469 --> 00:26:47.439
THE PARK MEANT. BECAUSE THE

00:26:47.505 --> 00:26:50.542
SEQUEL HAS SHIFTED. OUT OF WHAT

00:26:50.608 --> 00:26:53.511
THE PROTECTION REALLY IS AND SO

00:26:53.578 --> 00:26:56.314
TO GO TO OUR BY RIGHT SYSTEM.

00:26:56.381 --> 00:26:58.183
THAT DOES NOT ANALYZE WHAT THE

00:26:58.249 --> 00:27:00.885
IMPACTS ARE THAT ARE SO CLOSE

00:27:00.952 --> 00:27:03.054
TOGETHER IS NOT GOING TO BE

00:27:03.121 --> 00:27:05.290
HELPFUL IN ADDRESSING THE

00:27:05.357 --> 00:27:09.060
PROBLEM AND I THINK THAT. THE HI

00:27:09.127 --> 00:27:11.162
PAUL THIS SENATOR FOR RAISING

00:27:11.229 --> 00:27:13.898
THE ISSUE. AND ARE ARE AND I'M

00:27:13.965 --> 00:27:15.734
REALLY SORRY FOR THE SITUATION-

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.268
THAT WAS HIGHLIGHTED AT THE

00:27:17.335 --> 00:27:19.037
BEGINNING OF THE TESTIMONY. THE

00:27:19.104 --> 00:27:20.772
QUESTION IS DOES THE SOLUTION

00:27:20.839 --> 00:27:23.942
MATCH OF WHAT THE PROBLEM IS AND

00:27:24.009 --> 00:27:26.277
I THINK IT'S THE CONCEPT THAT IS

00:27:26.344 --> 00:27:28.980
A PROBLEM WHICH IS ANY BY RIGHT

00:27:29.047 --> 00:27:32.117
THAT DOESN'T SORT OF ANALYZE.

00:27:32.183 --> 00:27:34.019
THE DIFFERENT SITUATIONS THAT

00:27:34.085 --> 00:27:36.654
ACTUALLY EXIST IN THE MOMENT AND

00:27:36.721 --> 00:27:42.627
WE HAVE ONE. IN OUR AREA WHERE.

00:27:42.694 --> 00:27:43.762
WHEN THEY BUILT SANTA CRUZ HARD.

00:27:43.828 --> 00:27:45.897
IN IN IN WHAT. THEY HAD TO BILL

00:27:45.964 --> 00:27:47.332
OUT APARTMENTS ON POSOF TO

00:27:47.399 --> 00:27:49.034
PROTECTED COMING IN AND WHAT IT

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:50.969
REALLY DID. IS IT TOOK THIS

00:27:51.036 --> 00:27:53.271
BEAUTIFUL EXPANSIVE BEACH ON ONE

00:27:53.338 --> 00:27:55.974
SIDE IN THE CITY OF SANTA CRUZ

00:27:56.041 --> 00:27:57.409
AND- IT HAS COME BACK IN THE

00:27:57.475 --> 00:27:58.810
POLLUTION IS COMING AT THAT

00:27:58.877 --> 00:28:00.812
NEIGHBORHOOD MUCH CLOSER. AND

00:28:00.879 --> 00:28:02.614
THEN THE BEACH ON THE OTHER SIDE

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:04.049
WHICH WAS MUCH CLOSER HAS NOW

00:28:04.115 --> 00:28:07.052
EXPANDED WAY OUT. IN AND THAT IS

00:28:07.118 --> 00:28:09.421
THE NET EFFECT THAT HAPPENS.

00:28:09.487 --> 00:28:12.657
WITH SEQUELS. IN ORDER TO WORK

00:28:12.724 --> 00:28:13.858
WHEN I WAS ON THE CITY COUNCIL

00:28:13.925 --> 00:28:16.327
YEARS AGO WE- WE HAVE A ROUGH

00:28:16.394 --> 00:28:17.662
TIME BECAUSE IN SANTA CRUZ

00:28:17.729 --> 00:28:19.464
THERE'S TWO MILES OF RESIDENTIAL

00:28:19.531 --> 00:28:21.499
PEOPLE ACROSS THE STREET FROM

00:28:21.566 --> 00:28:23.468
THE NOTION AND WE HAD TO

00:28:23.535 --> 00:28:23.968
PRESIDENTIALLY DECLARED

00:28:24.035 --> 00:28:26.871
DISASTERS IN THAT PERIOD FOR

00:28:26.938 --> 00:28:28.673
ROSHEN. AND IT STARTED TO GO TO

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:32.644
STREETS AND STARTED TO GET AT

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:33.545
WHAT WAS GOING TO BE THE HOMES.

00:28:33.611 --> 00:28:35.246
AND WE NO CHOICE BUT TO PUT

00:28:35.313 --> 00:28:37.615
RIPRAP IN ON AN EMERGENCY BASIS

00:28:37.682 --> 00:28:39.717
TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE THERE. BUT

00:28:39.784 --> 00:28:41.052
THE HEAD OF THE LOCAL MARINE

00:28:41.119 --> 00:28:43.822
SCIENCES PROGRAM GARY GRIGGS.

00:28:43.888 --> 00:28:45.990
HAS BEEN WELL KNOWN AN OCEAN

00:28:46.057 --> 00:28:48.493
WORLD FOR FIFTY YEARS. TESTIFIED

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.562
TO US. I JUST NEED TO TELL YOU

00:28:50.628 --> 00:28:52.430
MOTHER NATURE ALWAYS WINS NO

00:28:52.497 --> 00:28:54.933
MATTER WHAT YOU DO MOTHER NATURE

00:28:54.999 --> 00:28:57.435
ALWAYS WINS SO YOU CAN THINK

00:28:57.502 --> 00:28:59.904
THAT YOU'RE PROTECTING. YOU'RE

00:28:59.971 --> 00:29:01.606
REARRANGING THE PROBLEM. IS

00:29:01.673 --> 00:29:04.242
POSTPONING THE INEVITABLE AND SO

00:29:04.309 --> 00:29:06.111
WHEN YOU HAVE A SITUATION LIKE

00:29:06.177 --> 00:29:07.445
THAT. IT DOESN'T CALL FOR

00:29:07.512 --> 00:29:09.581
ABSOLUTES IN LEGISLATION IT

00:29:09.647 --> 00:29:11.116
CALLS FOR LOOKING AT THE

00:29:11.182 --> 00:29:13.618
INDIVIDUAL SITUATIONS AND TRYING

00:29:13.685 --> 00:29:17.055
TO PASS PROTECTED IF THERE'S A

00:29:17.122 --> 00:29:18.223
HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILES OF

00:29:18.289 --> 00:29:19.357
PROTECTIONS. THE LONGER

00:29:19.424 --> 00:29:20.959
CALIFORNIA COAST ELEVEN HUNDRED

00:29:21.025 --> 00:29:23.928
MILES THEN THAT STATES THAT THAT

00:29:23.995 --> 00:29:25.730
WAS THE BEST PROTECTION THERE

00:29:25.797 --> 00:29:26.931
AND THIS IS ONLY GOING TO BE

00:29:26.998 --> 00:29:29.367
SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO GET

00:29:29.434 --> 00:29:32.537
MORE SERIOUS IT IS ONLY IF WE-

00:29:32.604 --> 00:29:34.672
IF WE HAVE SEA LEVEL RISE THAT'S

00:29:34.739 --> 00:29:37.375
TWO OR THREE. FEET BETWEEN NOW

00:29:37.442 --> 00:29:38.943
AND THE TURN OF THE NEXT

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:41.012
CENTURY. IT IS NOT JUST THAT

00:29:41.079 --> 00:29:43.281
THAT IS A GRADUAL RISE IT IS THE

00:29:43.348 --> 00:29:47.051
EXTREME EVENTS. IS EXTREME

00:29:47.118 --> 00:29:48.820
EVENTS THAT DRIVE HOME. ABOUT

00:29:48.887 --> 00:29:51.389
RISE AND SO WE ARE GOING TO HAVE

00:29:51.456 --> 00:29:53.458
TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IT'S THE

00:29:53.525 --> 00:29:54.259
REASON WE PASSED SB ONE LAST

00:29:54.325 --> 00:29:56.261
YEAR BUT I JUST DON'T THINK THE

00:29:56.327 --> 00:29:57.762
BY RIGHT SYSTEM FOR COASTAL

00:29:57.829 --> 00:29:59.397
ARMORING ITS DISSOLUTION AND I

00:29:59.464 --> 00:30:02.834
WILL BE NOT SUPPORTING THE BILL

00:30:02.901 --> 00:30:05.737

COMMISSION OURSELVES APPOINTED

00:30:23.888 --> 00:30:26.257
OVER TWELVE YEARS AGO. AND BACK

00:30:26.324 --> 00:30:28.393
THEN WE WERE HAVING REGULAR

00:30:28.459 --> 00:30:30.562
MEETINGS ON THE ISSUE OF SEA

00:30:30.628 --> 00:30:32.530
LEVEL RISE AND HOW THE CLOSE

00:30:32.597 --> 00:30:34.332
COMMISSION COULD START TO ENACT

00:30:34.399 --> 00:30:37.902
POLICIES TO COMBAT THAT THAT

00:30:37.969 --> 00:30:39.470
WELL THAT'S BEEN. MANY YEARS IN

00:30:39.537 --> 00:30:41.339

MY SERVICE. ON THE COASTAL

00:30:43.441 --> 00:30:45.143
COMMISSION AND I UNDERSTAND THAT

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:46.911
THIS IS A PROCESS AS QUICKLY

00:30:46.978 --> 00:30:51.716
PEOPLE TO. THE PROBLEM. A LITTLE

00:30:51.783 --> 00:30:54.319
KNOWN FACT ABOUT CALIFORNIA WE

00:30:54.385 --> 00:30:56.487
HAVE THE HIGHEST POINT

00:30:56.554 --> 00:30:58.022
GEOGRAPHICALLY CONTINENTAL

00:30:58.089 --> 00:31:00.058
UNITED STATES MOUNT WHITNEY AND

00:31:00.124 --> 00:31:01.993
THE LOWEST POINT BACK WATER

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:03.962
BASIN THAT ARE EIGHTY MILES

00:31:04.028 --> 00:31:06.564
APART. AND IT SPEAKS TO

00:31:06.631 --> 00:31:09.133
CALIFORNIA'S OF THE REASON WHY

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.668
THAT WERE THE GOLDEN STATE RIGHT

00:31:10.735 --> 00:31:13.838
CHIU THIS IS GEOGRAPHIC MARVEL

00:31:13.905 --> 00:31:16.674
BUT IT ALSO SPEAKS TO A LOT OF

00:31:16.741 --> 00:31:18.376
SEISMIC ACTIVITY. A LOT OF

00:31:18.443 --> 00:31:20.044
CHANGES HAPPEN HAVE HAPPENED IN

00:31:20.111 --> 00:31:21.980
OUR STATE'S COASTLINE ALL AROUND

00:31:22.046 --> 00:31:24.782
STATE. AND OVER THE YEARS NOT

00:31:24.849 --> 00:31:26.217
ONLY IN THE COAST BUT EVEN

00:31:26.284 --> 00:31:28.253
INLAND AND ALONG RIVER BODIES

00:31:28.319 --> 00:31:34.692
ALONG- GROUND THAT IS NOT. VERY

00:31:34.759 --> 00:31:36.694
STABLE WE HAVE BUILT A LOT OF

00:31:36.761 --> 00:31:38.796
HOUSING. THAT IS BECAUSE OF

00:31:38.863 --> 00:31:39.397
NORMA'S AMOUNT OF DAMAGE AND

00:31:39.464 --> 00:31:42.300
ACCIDENTS. AND TODAY WE'RE

00:31:42.367 --> 00:31:43.334
MAKING CORRECT TURKEY TAKING

00:31:43.401 --> 00:31:45.803
CORRECTIVE ACTION NOT ONLY IN

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:48.373
THE COAST FOR CROSS STATE AND

00:31:48.439 --> 00:31:50.275
THIS IS ONE OF THE- THE

00:31:50.341 --> 00:31:53.111
CONSEQUENCES OF. NOT BEING

00:31:53.177 --> 00:31:55.813
COMPLETELY THOROUGH IN OUR

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:58.416
EVALUATION WHERE IT'S SAFEST TO

00:31:58.483 --> 00:32:00.418
BUILD IN THE STATE. SO MIKE MY

00:32:00.485 --> 00:32:02.720
CONDOLENCES TO THE FAMILY THAT

00:32:02.787 --> 00:32:06.791
ARE OF SOFT SUFFERED- CORBEL

00:32:06.858 --> 00:32:08.493
ACCIDENTS AS A RESULT OF THIS.

00:32:08.559 --> 00:32:10.495
IT AFFECTS OUR TRANSPORTATION

00:32:10.561 --> 00:32:13.698
AFFECTS FAMILIES LIVES. BUT I

00:32:13.765 --> 00:32:16.434

AGGRESSIVE ACTION TO CORRECT

00:32:22.307 --> 00:32:24.075
SOMETHING ONLY IN THE SHORT TERM

00:32:24.142 --> 00:32:25.910
MORE THIS THAT WE HAVE TO. BE

00:32:25.977 --> 00:32:27.312
MORE THOUGHTFUL AND COME UP WITH

00:32:27.378 --> 00:32:28.946
A LONGER TERM SOLUTION THE ONE

00:32:29.013 --> 00:32:30.882
THAT'S GOING TO GIVE US THE

00:32:30.948 --> 00:32:32.717
BIGGEST BANG FOR THE INVESTMENT.

00:32:32.784 --> 00:32:34.185
THAT'LL HELP US SOLVE THESE

00:32:34.252 --> 00:32:36.087
PROBLEMS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT

00:32:36.154 --> 00:32:39.357
CENTER LOOP LEAD DESCRIBED IN

00:32:39.424 --> 00:32:41.459
TERMS OF LOOKING UP. AT A

00:32:41.526 --> 00:32:43.294
COMPLETE LOOK AT OUR OCEAN AND

00:32:43.361 --> 00:32:44.862
LOOK AT PROJECT BY PROJECT I

00:32:44.929 --> 00:32:48.700
RECOMMEND. THAT THROUGH YOUR

00:32:48.766 --> 00:32:50.335
TRANSACTION TO OUR ACTION HERE

00:32:50.401 --> 00:32:51.235
THAT WE WORK WITH THE LOCAL

00:32:51.302 --> 00:32:53.604
GOVERNMENT AND CITY LEADERS TO

00:32:53.671 --> 00:32:54.872
PROPOSE I HEARD THERE WERE SOME

00:32:54.939 --> 00:32:56.574
SOLUTIONS THAT- WERE PROPOSED BY

00:32:56.641 --> 00:32:57.942
THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS IF

00:32:58.009 --> 00:33:00.011
THEY REALLY HAVE SOME SOLUTIONS

00:33:00.078 --> 00:33:02.413
THEY SHOULD BE. PROPOSED THEY

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:03.981
SHOULD BE PUT IN FRONT OF THE

00:33:04.048 --> 00:33:05.116
LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN FRONT OF THE

00:33:05.183 --> 00:33:06.584
COSTA COMMISSION AND WE SHOULD

00:33:06.651 --> 00:33:08.219
START WORKING ON INDIVIDUAL

00:33:08.286 --> 00:33:10.455
PROJECTS THAT SOLVE THIS PROBLEM

00:33:10.521 --> 00:33:12.357
IN A WAY THAT DON'T EXACERBATED

00:33:12.423 --> 00:33:14.726
I BELIEVE THIS LAW WILL

00:33:14.792 --> 00:33:15.193
EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM

00:33:15.259 --> 00:33:17.295
STATEWIDE. THEY MIGHT BE A GOOD

00:33:17.362 --> 00:33:19.464
LAW IN THE CASE FOR INSULATORS

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:21.632
MAYBE THIS ONE PROJECT BUT IT

00:33:21.699 --> 00:33:24.235
WILL DEFINITELY CAUSE A REVERSAL

00:33:24.302 --> 00:33:25.503

A STATE WIDE. LEVEL BUT

00:33:34.445 --> 00:33:36.114

BATES SO GETTING. INTO THIS

00:35:09.574 --> 00:35:11.442
PARTICULAR ISSUE. WINNOW THE

00:35:11.509 --> 00:35:13.244
TRAGEDY OCCURRED AND HENCE THE

00:35:13.311 --> 00:35:15.079
NEED IS AND CERTAINLY THERE

00:35:15.146 --> 00:35:16.180
WERE. MANY THREATS BEFORE THAT

00:35:16.247 --> 00:35:18.082
THAT I. THE WEARER OF BEING A

00:35:18.149 --> 00:35:19.851
ALL COASTAL RESIDENTS. BUT I

00:35:19.917 --> 00:35:22.186
LOOKED AT CHAPTER THREE ARTICLE

00:35:22.253 --> 00:35:23.321
FOUR OF THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL

00:35:23.387 --> 00:35:25.256
ACT. WHICH SPECIFICALLY IF

00:35:25.323 --> 00:35:26.858
THERE'S A BY RIGHT IS CONTAINED

00:35:26.924 --> 00:35:30.194
IN THAT SECTION ON THREE OH TWO

00:35:30.261 --> 00:35:32.497
THREE FIVE I BELIEVE IT IS.

00:35:32.563 --> 00:35:33.631
WHERE IT SAYS REVETMENTS

00:35:33.698 --> 00:35:34.198
BREAKWATERS GROWING HARBOR

00:35:34.265 --> 00:35:35.266

PERMITTED WHEN REQUIRED TO SERVE

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:41.672
COASTAL DEPENDENT USES. OR TO

00:35:41.739 --> 00:35:43.241
PROTECT EXISTING STRUCTURES ARE

00:35:43.307 --> 00:35:47.278
PUBLIC. BEACHES AND DANGER OF

00:35:47.345 --> 00:35:48.913
EROSION. SO I LOOK AT THAT I

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:50.281
THOUGHT I WAS WITH. WORK AND WE

00:35:50.348 --> 00:35:51.516
WERE LOOKING OUT LAW. AND

00:35:51.582 --> 00:35:53.117
INTERPRETATION THE COUNTY LEVEL

00:35:53.184 --> 00:35:55.486
AND I WAS A TRAINER AT THAT TIME

00:35:55.553 --> 00:35:58.422
FOR MY UNIT- WE LEARNED THAT THE

00:35:58.489 --> 00:36:00.992

00:36:01.058 --> 00:36:02.827
SHALL IN IS NOT DISCRETIONARY.

00:36:02.894 --> 00:36:04.295
SO WHEN I SAW SHALL I THOUGHT

00:36:04.362 --> 00:36:06.664
WOW HERE'S AN APT IN THE COAL

00:36:06.731 --> 00:36:09.000
ACT AND PROVISION OF SUCH SHALL

00:36:09.066 --> 00:36:11.469

00:36:11.536 --> 00:36:14.171
BY SB SIX TWENTY SEVEN HE WAS

00:36:14.238 --> 00:36:15.673
ALREADY IN THE COASTAL OUT

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:17.041
SUBSEQUENT TO AMENDMENTS. AND

00:36:17.108 --> 00:36:19.911
CERTAINLY CHANGES OVER TIME WITH

00:36:19.977 --> 00:36:23.514
THE WITH THE TERM EXISTING

00:36:23.581 --> 00:36:24.749
STRUCTURE. AND THAT HAS BEEN

00:36:24.815 --> 00:36:25.683
DEFINED AS ANYTHING BEFORE I

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:28.386
THINK OF DEAL TO NINETEEN

00:36:28.452 --> 00:36:29.453
SEVENTY SEVEN HOWEVER PASSED

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:30.354
NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN. THE

00:36:30.421 --> 00:36:32.023
COASTAL COMMISSION DID APPROVE

00:36:32.089 --> 00:36:34.892
OF DEVELOPMENT OF STRUCTURES IN

00:36:34.959 --> 00:36:36.827
PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE SUBSEQUENT

00:36:36.894 --> 00:36:39.196
TO THAT TIME. SO THERE'S STILL A

00:36:39.263 --> 00:36:41.332
LITTLE DEBATE ABOUT EXISTING I

00:36:41.399 --> 00:36:42.199
WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT

00:36:42.266 --> 00:36:43.734
EXISTING STRUCTURE OF BILLS THAT

00:36:43.801 --> 00:36:45.636
ARE NATURALLY CREATED STRUCTURES

00:36:45.703 --> 00:36:47.405
WHICH HAPPEN TO BE THE BLUFF.

00:36:47.471 --> 00:36:49.407
THOSE ARE NATURAL GEOLOGICAL

00:36:49.473 --> 00:36:51.642
STRUCTURES ALONG THE COAST OF

00:36:51.709 --> 00:36:53.177
CALIFORNIA IN MANY CALLS FOR A

00:36:53.244 --> 00:36:55.246
OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

00:36:55.313 --> 00:36:57.515
AND CERTAINLY IN THE WORLD. SO

00:36:57.582 --> 00:36:59.617
TO ME WHEN I LOOKED AT THE OFTEN

00:36:59.684 --> 00:37:01.686
I'M TRYING TO THINK OF WHAT CAN

00:37:01.752 --> 00:37:04.722
WE DO TO US. TO ACCELERATE-

00:37:04.789 --> 00:37:06.490
SOLUTIONS THAT WE ARE SEEING

00:37:06.557 --> 00:37:08.693
THEIR AMOUNTING OVER ON C. LEVEL

00:37:08.759 --> 00:37:10.261
RISE AND AN ADDITIONAL

00:37:10.328 --> 00:37:12.029
CONSTRUCTION BASICALLY OF PUBLIC

00:37:12.096 --> 00:37:14.298
INFRASTRUCTURE HARBORS CHANNEL

00:37:14.365 --> 00:37:16.000
FOR BOTH CONTRIBUTE. DAMMING

00:37:16.067 --> 00:37:18.135
RIVERS CONTRIBUTE TO THE LOSS OF

00:37:18.202 --> 00:37:20.037
SOUND NOT JUST SEE WHAT. WE KNOW

00:37:20.104 --> 00:37:21.339
THAT FROM THE EVIDENCE

00:37:21.405 --> 00:37:23.341
SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE. SO IT SEEMS

00:37:23.407 --> 00:37:25.977
LOGICAL THAT WE WOULD BRING THIS

00:37:26.043 --> 00:37:27.144
FORWARD SO I APPRECIATE THE

00:37:27.211 --> 00:37:28.980
DISCUSSION I THINK IT OPENS UP A

00:37:29.046 --> 00:37:31.148
BROADER DISCUSSION OF WHAT CAN

00:37:31.215 --> 00:37:33.084
HAPPEN IN THE NEAR TERM AND I

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:34.185
CERTAINLY APPRECIATE WHAT.

00:37:34.251 --> 00:37:36.721
SENATOR HUESO SAID ABOUT TRYING

00:37:36.787 --> 00:37:38.756
TO GET SOMETHING THAT IS HIM ON

00:37:38.823 --> 00:37:40.725
THE MERCHANT. CAN SOLVE THAT

00:37:40.791 --> 00:37:42.326
RIGHT NOW IS REALLY REALLY

00:37:42.393 --> 00:37:44.462
IMPORTANT FOR THE LIFE AND

00:37:44.528 --> 00:37:46.497
CERTAINLY FOR BEACH ACCESS. FOR

00:37:46.564 --> 00:37:48.332
THE PUBLIC IN THE LONGER TERM

00:37:48.399 --> 00:37:50.234
ABSOLUTELY WE'VE GOT TO FIND A

00:37:50.301 --> 00:37:52.036
LONGER TERM SOLUTION THAT

00:37:52.103 --> 00:37:54.839
DOESN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS

00:37:54.905 --> 00:37:55.873
VERY TEDIOUS- PERMIT PROCESS

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:57.208
LOCAL FULL COMMISSION HAS TO

00:37:57.274 --> 00:37:59.243
DEAL WITH AND I KNOW IT'S NOT

00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:01.145
EASY FOR THEM. TO HAVE TO GO

00:38:01.212 --> 00:38:02.513
THROUGH THE FOR THE EACH AND

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:04.048
EVERY APPLICANT I CERTAINLY

00:38:04.115 --> 00:38:04.915
APPRECIATE THAT THERE'S A LOT

00:38:04.982 --> 00:38:06.951
HERE I DO BELIEVE THAT CAN

00:38:07.018 --> 00:38:08.819
CONTINUE DISCUSSION I CERTAINLY

00:38:08.886 --> 00:38:10.955
WILL TAKE THAT ON. BUT YOU YOU

00:38:11.022 --> 00:38:13.157
KNOW THAT I FEEL VERY PASSIONATE

00:38:13.224 --> 00:38:15.259
ABOUT THIS AND I DO THINK IN THE

00:38:15.326 --> 00:38:16.794
COASTAL ACT IN THIS PARTICULAR

00:38:16.861 --> 00:38:18.596
AREA. NEEDS A DEEPER DIVE INTO

00:38:18.663 --> 00:38:20.464
WHAT IT ACTUALLY MEANT AND I

00:38:20.531 --> 00:38:21.966
KNOW THEY'RE BEING COURT CASES

00:38:22.033 --> 00:38:24.035
TAKING LOOK AT BACK. STILL IT

00:38:24.101 --> 00:38:26.103
DOES NOT DISCUSSION GOING ON BUT

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:28.205
I DO THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT

00:38:28.272 --> 00:38:29.306
STRUCTURES AS SOMETHING THAT

00:38:29.373 --> 00:38:31.742
INCLUDES BLUFF. NOT JUST PUBLIC

00:38:31.809 --> 00:38:33.411
INFRASTRUCTURE AND NOT JUST

00:38:33.477 --> 00:38:35.279
PRIVATE PROPERTY STRUCTURES.

00:38:35.346 --> 00:38:36.781
SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE TO

00:38:36.847 --> 00:38:38.516
ENSURE THAT WE CAN PROTECT OUR

00:38:38.582 --> 00:38:40.151
COLLECTIVE POLICY TO PROVIDE US

00:38:40.217 --> 00:38:41.352
YOU ALL ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH

00:38:41.419 --> 00:38:43.621
THE CHANCE THAT THEY HAVE OVER

00:38:43.688 --> 00:38:44.722
THEIR SLOPES. SO THERE IS A

00:38:44.789 --> 00:38:46.624
RELATION THAT GOES DOWN AND

00:38:46.691 --> 00:38:47.692
HELPS REPLENISH BUT IT DOESN'T

00:38:47.758 --> 00:38:49.326
FALL DOWN ON CARS AND PEOPLE AND

00:38:49.393 --> 00:38:51.195
BEACH GOERS. SO WE NEED TO TAKE

00:38:51.262 --> 00:38:53.597
A LOOK AND CERTAINLY WITH SB

00:38:53.664 --> 00:38:54.832
ONE. THANK GOODNESS WE GOT THAT

00:38:54.899 --> 00:38:56.100
PASS AND THERE'S GOING TO BE I

00:38:56.167 --> 00:38:58.502
THINK WHAT IS THAT A HUNDRED

00:38:58.569 --> 00:38:59.036
MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY.

00:38:59.103 --> 00:39:00.571
THERE'S MONEY THERE TO DO

00:39:00.638 --> 00:39:02.506
SOMETHING SO LET US NOT JUST

00:39:02.573 --> 00:39:07.078
STOP. HERE BECAUSE THIS BILL I

00:39:07.144 --> 00:39:08.379
DON'T THINK IT OUT THIS WITH.

00:39:08.446 --> 00:39:10.815
VERY TO ALL UP THE DISCUSSION

00:39:10.881 --> 00:39:12.983
INTO A LOOK WHAT WHAT DID ARMS

00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:14.185
STATE. VOTERS MEAN WHEN THEY

00:39:14.251 --> 00:39:15.753
PASSED LOCAL FLAT THAN THIS

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:17.555
WITHIN A- IT IS LIFTING

00:39:17.621 --> 00:39:19.290
STRUCTURE AND- SEVENTY THREE

00:39:19.356 --> 00:39:21.926
WHEN PAST. DID THEY THINK ABOUT.

00:39:21.992 --> 00:39:23.494
ALL OF THIS OR WOULD THAT JUST

00:39:23.561 --> 00:39:25.096
WHAT WAS THERE WHEN THE BILL WAS

00:39:25.162 --> 00:39:27.998
PASSED AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S

00:39:28.065 --> 00:39:29.366
WHAT IT WAS BECAUSE I HAPPEN TO

00:39:29.433 --> 00:39:31.669
VOTED FOR IT. SO I THOUGHT IT

00:39:31.736 --> 00:39:32.436
WAS EVERYTHING INCLUDING THE

00:39:32.503 --> 00:39:34.505
PROTECTION THAT WE NEED FOR A

00:39:34.572 --> 00:39:35.873
