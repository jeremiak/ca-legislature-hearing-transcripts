TWENTY FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION

00:27:23.341 --> 00:27:24.876
ACRES THAT'S REALLY THE REASON

00:27:24.943 --> 00:27:27.278
WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY. 90% OF

00:27:27.345 --> 00:27:28.813
THESE ARE FAMILY FARMS WITH AN

WITH A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT IS

00:29:36.541 --> 00:29:38.009
LEAD ME NEED A YOUNGER PERSON TO

00:29:38.076 --> 00:29:41.346

OF THE NATIONAL LEVEL AMERICAN

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:46.718
FARMLAND TRUST --

00:29:46.784 --> 00:29:47.719
NATIONAL TEAM JUST RELEASED A

00:29:47.785 --> 00:29:49.320
STUDY THIS SPRING CALLED STATE

00:29:49.387 --> 00:29:50.321
OF AMERICA'S FARMLAND FARMS

00:29:50.388 --> 00:29:52.790
UNDER THREAT --

00:29:52.857 --> 00:29:54.359
THIS IS WHAT THE PATTERNS OF

00:29:54.425 --> 00:29:55.960
DEVELOPMENT LOOK LIKE ACROSS THE

00:29:56.027 --> 00:29:58.096
COUNTRY OVER TWENTY YEARS OF THE

00:29:58.163 --> 00:29:59.164
DARKER.

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:01.633
MAROON COLORS ARE BACK HIGH

00:30:01.699 --> 00:30:04.536
LEVELS OF CONVERSION FROM --

00:30:04.602 --> 00:30:06.237
FARMLAND TO OTHER USES.

00:30:06.304 --> 00:30:07.805
I THE STUDY SHOWED THAT OVERALL

00:30:07.872 --> 00:30:09.307
DEVELOPMENT DISPROPORTIONATELY

00:30:09.374 --> 00:30:11.943
OCCURRED ON AGRICULTURAL LANDS

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:13.278
MORE THAN 70% OF URBAN

00:30:13.344 --> 00:30:15.380
DEVELOPMENT AND 62% OF ALL

00:30:15.446 --> 00:30:16.347
DEVELOPMENT TOOK PLACE ON

00:30:16.414 --> 00:30:18.349
AGRICULTURAL LANDS.

00:30:18.416 --> 00:30:20.552
WE HAVE DEVELOPED NEARLY TWICE

00:30:20.618 --> 00:30:22.820
AS MUCH LAND AS WE PREVIOUSLY

00:30:22.887 --> 00:30:24.556
REPORTED IN TWO THOUSAND AND

00:30:24.622 --> 00:30:25.957
WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY

00:30:26.024 --> 00:30:27.959
DEVELOPING UP LAND WITH GREATER

00:30:28.026 --> 00:30:29.360
PRODUCTIVITY.

00:30:29.427 --> 00:30:31.062
VERSATILE VERSATA --

00:30:31.129 --> 00:30:32.730
VERSATILITY AND RESILIENCE SIX

00:30:32.797 --> 00:30:36.067
WERE LOSING THE BEST STUFF --

00:30:36.134 --> 00:30:39.637
IF WE ACT HEAD OF ZOOM INTO THE

00:30:39.704 --> 00:30:40.738
STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS VERY LINE

00:30:40.805 --> 00:30:42.106
YOU GUYS PROBABLY ALL KNOW THESE

00:30:42.173 --> 00:30:44.075
NUMBERS BUT THIS IS FROM THE

00:30:44.142 --> 00:30:45.076
DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION

00:30:45.143 --> 00:30:46.945
REMOVED REMOVING LAND FROM

00:30:47.011 --> 00:30:50.481
FARMING USES AT A RATE OF FIFTY

00:30:50.548 --> 00:30:51.749
THOUSAND ACRES ANNUALLY --

00:30:51.816 --> 00:30:54.752
OF THAT LAND CONVERTED 49% WAS

00:30:54.819 --> 00:30:56.588
FARMLAND PRIME FARMLAND IN THE

00:30:56.654 --> 00:31:05.630
LAST THIRTY YEARS. FOR EVERY

00:31:05.697 --> 00:31:07.565
FIVE ACRES LEAVING OUT.

00:31:07.632 --> 00:31:08.633
THAT THE AVERAGE DENSITY OF THE

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:11.102
STATE'S URBAN AREAS IS LESS THAN

00:31:11.169 --> 00:31:12.937
TEN PEOPLE FOR EVERY ACRE

00:31:13.004 --> 00:31:14.172
DEVELOPED THAT IS THE VERY

00:31:14.239 --> 00:31:15.540
DEFINITION OF LOW DENSITY

00:31:15.607 --> 00:31:17.308
DEVELOPMENT SO WE'RE NOT USING

00:31:17.375 --> 00:31:19.177
OUR SPACE EFFICIENTLY.

00:31:19.244 --> 00:31:20.578
IN CALIFORNIA OR IN THE COUNTRY

00:31:20.645 --> 00:31:22.013
F. THE CURRENT TRENDS CONTINUE

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.115
ON THIS PATH WERE LIKELY TO LOSE

00:31:24.182 --> 00:31:25.984
ANOTHER ONE POINT FIVE TO TWO

00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:27.785
MILLION ACRES OF FARMLAND.

00:31:27.852 --> 00:31:32.757
AGRICULTURAL LAND BY.

00:31:32.824 --> 00:31:33.658
TWENTY FIFTY I BET I JUST WANT

00:31:33.725 --> 00:31:35.493
TO ZOOM IN AGAIN SETTING THE

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:37.061
CONTEXT FOR THE LATER PART OF

00:31:37.128 --> 00:31:38.263
THIS PRESENTATION --

00:31:38.329 --> 00:31:40.765
ZOOM INTO THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY --

00:31:40.832 --> 00:31:42.166
OUR CALIFORNIA TEAM JUST

00:31:42.233 --> 00:31:43.835
RELEASED A REPORT LAST SPRING

00:31:43.901 --> 00:31:45.169
THAT LOOKS AT THE INTERSECTION

00:31:45.236 --> 00:31:46.904
OF AGRICULTURAL LAND AND WATER

00:31:46.971 --> 00:31:48.506
RESOURCES IN THE SAN JOAQUIN

00:31:48.573 --> 00:31:49.407
VALLEY.

00:31:49.474 --> 00:31:50.341
OUR GOALS WERE TO IDENTIFY THE

00:31:50.408 --> 00:31:54.312
MOST -- WE

00:31:54.379 --> 00:31:55.513
KNOW THAT WHILE EVERY ACRE OF

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:57.582
LAND TO PROTECT PRODUCTION

00:31:57.649 --> 00:31:58.850
POSSESSES THE ATTRIBUTES

00:31:58.916 --> 00:32:01.419
NECESSARY TO SUPPORT AGRICULTURE.

00:32:01.486 --> 00:32:03.221
SOME LAND IS OF HIGHER QUALITY

00:32:03.288 --> 00:32:05.189
AND SOME LAND HAS MORE RELIABLE

00:32:05.256 --> 00:32:06.958
WATER SOURCES.

00:32:07.025 --> 00:32:08.359
KNOWING THE COMBINATION OF THOSE

00:32:08.426 --> 00:32:10.061
ATTRIBUTES WE CAN DO BETTER

00:32:10.128 --> 00:32:11.629
PLANNING FOR PROTECTING FARMLAND

00:32:11.696 --> 00:32:13.231
IN THE VALLEY.

00:32:13.298 --> 00:32:14.265
SOME KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM THE

00:32:14.332 --> 00:32:15.900
REPORT.

00:32:15.967 --> 00:32:17.902
LESS THAN ONE OUT OF TEN ACRES

00:32:17.969 --> 00:32:19.237
OF AGRICULTURAL LAND IN THE

00:32:19.304 --> 00:32:20.705
VALLEY IS OF HIGH QUALITY AND

00:32:20.772 --> 00:32:22.040
LOW WATER STRESS.

00:32:22.106 --> 00:32:23.808
BUT THE BIG FINDING.

00:32:23.875 --> 00:32:26.377
IN CONTRAST FOUR IN TEN ACRES

00:32:26.444 --> 00:32:27.812
ARE OF LOW QUALITY OR

00:32:27.879 --> 00:32:31.249
EXPERIENCING HIGH WATER STRESS.

00:32:31.316 --> 00:32:32.984
ONE OUT OF SIX ACRES OF WHAT IS

00:32:33.051 --> 00:32:35.153
ARGUABLY THE BEST MOST RESILIENT

00:32:35.219 --> 00:32:36.854
LAND IN THE VALLEY IS AT RISK OF

00:32:36.921 --> 00:32:42.026
BEING DEVELOPED.

00:32:42.093 --> 00:32:44.095
BEGIN IN TERMS OF THE WATER

00:32:44.162 --> 00:32:45.496
QUALITY IS THE SECOND NUMBER

00:32:45.563 --> 00:32:46.597
THAT YOU GAVE.

00:32:46.664 --> 00:32:48.166
SO -- FOUR

00:32:48.232 --> 00:32:49.767
IN TEN ACRES.

00:32:49.834 --> 00:32:51.569
ARE OF LOW QUALITY OR

00:32:51.636 --> 00:32:55.840
EXPERIENCING HIGH WATER STRESS.

00:32:55.907 --> 00:32:56.874
AND I CAN SHARE THAT REPORT WITH

00:32:56.941 --> 00:32:58.343
YOU GUYS --

00:32:58.409 --> 00:33:00.578
SO WHAT IF WE'RE ABLE TO AVOID

00:33:00.645 --> 00:33:02.380
CONVERSION OF OUR AGRICULTURAL

00:33:02.447 --> 00:33:04.282
LANDS WHETHER THE ENVIRONMENTAL

00:33:04.349 --> 00:33:05.817
BENEFITS THAT THESE LANDS HAVE

00:33:05.883 --> 00:33:07.752
THE POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE.

00:33:07.819 --> 00:33:09.420
WE KNOW IT'S ABOUT SAVING OUR

00:33:09.487 --> 00:33:11.255
AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY WE KNOW

00:33:11.322 --> 00:33:13.224
IT'S ABOUT PROTECTING THE

00:33:13.291 --> 00:33:13.858
NATION'S FOOD SECURITY WE NEED

00:33:13.925 --> 00:33:15.460
FOOD -- OR

00:33:15.526 --> 00:33:16.627
BECOMING INCREASINGLY AWARE OF

00:33:16.694 --> 00:33:18.129
THE POTENTIAL FOR AGRICULTURAL

00:33:18.196 --> 00:33:19.964
LANDS TO SEQUESTER CARBON FROM

00:33:20.031 --> 00:33:21.065
THE ATMOSPHERE WHEN THEY'RE

00:33:21.132 --> 00:33:22.333
MANAGED PROPERLY.

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.369
WERE ALSO INCREASINGLY BECOMING

00:33:24.435 --> 00:33:25.536
AWARE OF THE GROUNDWATER

00:33:25.603 --> 00:33:26.838
RECHARGE POTENTIAL THAT

00:33:26.904 --> 00:33:28.573
AGRICULTURAL LANDS AND

00:33:28.639 --> 00:33:29.807
ESPECIALLY THOSE INNER CITIES.

00:33:29.874 --> 00:33:30.341
PROVIDES TO HELP WITH THE

00:33:30.408 --> 00:33:33.010
STATE'S WATER.

00:33:33.077 --> 00:33:34.645
WE ALSO NOW HAVE A LOT OF DATA

00:33:34.712 --> 00:33:36.080
THAT SUPPORTS AGRICULTURAL

00:33:36.147 --> 00:33:38.149
PRESERVATION AS A GREENHOUSE GAS

00:33:38.216 --> 00:33:40.218
REDUCTION STRATEGIES I WILL BE

00:33:40.284 --> 00:33:43.254
FOCUSING ON THAT YELLOW BUBBLE --

00:33:43.321 --> 00:33:44.589
BUT IF WE CAN'T STABILIZE

00:33:44.655 --> 00:33:45.490
HURTLING TO PROTECT IT FROM

00:33:45.556 --> 00:33:47.191
BEING LOST WE CAN ACHIEVE ANY OF

00:33:47.258 --> 00:33:52.230
THESE THINGS.

00:33:52.296 --> 00:33:54.031
THIS QUOTE IN ALL RITA IS FROM

00:33:54.098 --> 00:33:55.199
AUTHORS OF ONE OF THE MOST

00:33:55.266 --> 00:33:57.001
COMPLETE REVIEWS OF LITERATURE

00:33:57.068 --> 00:33:58.503
ON REDUCING AGRICULTURAL

00:33:58.569 --> 00:34:00.071
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THEY

00:34:00.138 --> 00:34:01.806
LOOKED AT ABOUT TWENTY STUDIES

00:34:01.873 --> 00:34:03.040
OF EVERYTHING FROM NUTRIENT

00:34:03.107 --> 00:34:05.076
MANAGEMENT. TO COVER CROPPING

00:34:05.143 --> 00:34:07.145
ANDCOMPOSTING AND HERE WAS

00:34:07.211 --> 00:34:09.447
THEIR ULTIMATE CONCLUSION.

00:34:09.514 --> 00:34:10.882
BECAUSE THE AVERAGE GREENHOUSE

00:34:10.948 --> 00:34:12.517
GAS EMISSIONS FROM URBAN LAND

00:34:12.583 --> 00:34:14.185
USES ARE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE

00:34:14.252 --> 00:34:15.386
HIGHER THAN THOSE FROM

00:34:15.453 --> 00:34:17.054
CALIFORNIA CROPLANDS.

00:34:17.121 --> 00:34:19.190
FARMLAND PRESERVATION MORE THAN

00:34:19.257 --> 00:34:21.092
ANY OTHER MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:22.059
WILL LIKELY HAVE THE SINGLE

00:34:22.126 --> 00:34:24.195
GREATEST IMPACT IN STABILIZING

00:34:24.262 --> 00:34:25.797
AND REDUCING FUTURE EMISSIONS

00:34:25.863 --> 00:34:26.898
ACROSS MULTIPLE LAND USE

00:34:26.964 --> 00:34:30.902
CATEGORY.

00:34:30.968 --> 00:34:32.670
SEE THE REASON THAT'S IMPORTANT.

00:34:32.737 --> 00:34:33.438
IS THAT THAT [inaudible]

00:34:33.504 --> 00:34:35.840
THAT.

00:34:35.907 --> 00:34:37.909
HAS NO PLACE WEEK THERE'S NO

00:34:37.975 --> 00:34:40.211
WHERE WE WERE DOING THIS.

00:34:40.278 --> 00:34:42.046
AND IN IT AS A GHG REDUCTION

00:34:42.113 --> 00:34:44.649
STRATEGY.

00:34:44.715 --> 00:34:45.917
THAT'S PROBABLY THE BIGGEST

00:34:45.983 --> 00:34:47.218
TAKEAWAY THAT YOU CAN TAKE FROM

00:34:47.285 --> 00:34:48.886
THIS COMMITTEE YEAH IT'S IT

00:34:48.953 --> 00:34:49.754
REALLY WHEN WE'VE BEEN TALKING

00:34:49.821 --> 00:34:50.588
ABOUT.

00:34:50.655 --> 00:34:52.690
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION.

00:34:52.757 --> 00:34:53.291
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT OTHER

00:34:53.357 --> 00:34:54.659
THINGS.

00:34:54.725 --> 00:34:55.693
WE HAVE AND THEY'RE UP THERE ARE

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:58.529
HINTS OF THIS IN THE SCOPING

00:34:58.596 --> 00:34:59.363
PLAN THE CALIFORNIA BUT THEIR

00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:00.665
HITS.

00:35:00.731 --> 00:35:02.500
SO WE NEED TO START IMPLEMENTING

00:35:02.567 --> 00:35:04.669
THAT HITS --

00:35:04.735 --> 00:35:05.736
INCE'S THE OPERATIVE WORD THERE

00:35:05.803 --> 00:35:07.638
HAVE RIGHT --

00:35:07.705 --> 00:35:09.340
SO AND HERE'S WHAT THE MAGNITUDE

00:35:09.407 --> 00:35:10.541
LOOKS LIKE --

00:35:10.608 --> 00:35:12.143
A COUPLE OF OTHER STUDIES SHOW

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:13.778
WITH THAT MAGNITUDE IS THE

00:35:13.845 --> 00:35:15.112
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN.

00:35:15.179 --> 00:35:16.814
CROP PRODUCTION AND URBAN THAT

00:35:16.881 --> 00:35:18.950
LAND USES AND THEIR RELATIVES

00:35:19.016 --> 00:35:21.419
GHG EMISSIONS SO YOU YOU MAY

00:35:21.486 --> 00:35:23.387
KNOW OF THE WORK DONE BY

00:35:23.454 --> 00:35:25.356
PROFESSOR LOUISE JACKSON AND HER

00:35:25.423 --> 00:35:26.591
COLLEAGUES AT UC DAVIS.

00:35:26.657 --> 00:35:27.592
THEY WERE THE FIRST TO ESTABLISH

00:35:27.658 --> 00:35:28.793
THE CONNECTION BETWEEN

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:31.229
URBANIZATION OF FARMLAND AND THE

00:35:31.295 --> 00:35:31.762
INCREASE OF GREENHOUSE GAS

00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:33.264
EMISSIONS.

00:35:33.331 --> 00:35:34.298
THEIR WORK FOUND THAT IN YOLO

00:35:34.365 --> 00:35:37.134
COUNTY GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS --

00:35:37.201 --> 00:35:39.203
FROM URBAN USES ROUGHLY SEVENTY

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:41.339
TIMES GREATER ON A PER ACRE

00:35:41.405 --> 00:35:42.540
BASIS THAN THOSE FROM

00:35:42.607 --> 00:35:44.609
AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS.

00:35:44.675 --> 00:35:46.110
BUT WE TOOK THAT AND WE DID A

00:35:46.177 --> 00:35:47.478
SECOND STUDY WE WANTED TO LOOK

00:35:47.545 --> 00:35:49.847
AT CROPS ACROSS CALIFORNIA

00:35:49.914 --> 00:35:51.048
DIFFERENT TYPES OF CROPS AND

00:35:51.115 --> 00:35:53.451
DIFFERENT TYPES OF CITIES --

00:35:53.518 --> 00:35:54.485
SO WE REACHED SIMILAR

00:35:54.552 --> 00:35:56.254
CONCLUSIONS LOOKING AT THE

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.755
STATE'S LEADING CROPS WHICH ARE

00:35:57.822 --> 00:35:59.724
HERE IN THIS GRAPH --

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:00.825
IN THIRTEEN CITIES THROUGHOUT

00:36:00.892 --> 00:36:03.461
CALIFORNIA THIS STUDY FOUND THAT

00:36:03.528 --> 00:36:04.595
THIS FINDING HOLDS TRUE ACROSS

00:36:04.662 --> 00:36:07.365
CALIFORNIA'S TOP.

00:36:07.431 --> 00:36:08.132
HER TUMULT MULTIPLY URBAN I

00:36:08.199 --> 00:36:09.634
TYPES.

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.435
I'M ON AVERAGE OUR CALCULATIONS

00:36:11.502 --> 00:36:13.771
SHOW THAT THE ANNUAL PER ACRE

00:36:13.838 --> 00:36:15.273
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM

00:36:15.339 --> 00:36:16.474
THE PRODUCTION OF CALIFORNIANS

00:36:16.541 --> 00:36:18.309
LEADING CROPS.

00:36:18.376 --> 00:36:20.611
AVERAGE FIFTY TONS PER ACRE

00:36:20.678 --> 00:36:22.880
LOWER FIFTY TONS OF GREENHOUSE

00:36:22.947 --> 00:36:24.782
GAS EMISSIONS EQUIVALENT I'M

00:36:24.849 --> 00:36:26.784
LOWER THAN THE EMISSIONS FROM

00:36:26.851 --> 00:36:29.253
URBAN AREAS AROUND THE STATE.

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.522
THIS TRANSLATES INTO A FIFTY

00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:32.790
EIGHT TIMES HIGHER GREENHOUSE

00:36:32.857 --> 00:36:35.359
GAS EMISSIONS FROM URBAN AREAS

00:36:35.426 --> 00:36:37.728
THEN FROM IRRIGATED CROPLAND.

00:36:37.795 --> 00:36:39.363
AGAINST IT'S THE SAME MAGNITUDE

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:41.832
SO WE'RE SAYING FIFTY EIGHT TO

00:36:41.899 --> 00:36:42.466
SEVENTY TIMES GREATER BASED ON

00:36:42.533 --> 00:36:45.136
THOSE TWO STUDIES --

00:36:45.202 --> 00:36:47.905
NOW WHERE I LIKE TO HONE IN IS

00:36:47.972 --> 00:36:50.041
ON LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION

00:36:50.107 --> 00:36:51.676
DENSITY AND CITY DENSITY --

00:36:51.742 --> 00:36:52.810
IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND ALL

00:36:52.877 --> 00:36:55.446
OF THAT RESEARCH --

00:36:55.513 --> 00:36:57.748
AT IN ALL OF IT THAT SHOWS THAT

00:36:57.815 --> 00:36:59.450
THE CONVERSION OF CROPLAND TECH

00:36:59.517 --> 00:37:00.418
URBAN USES IT DOES NOT

00:37:00.484 --> 00:37:01.519
NECESSARILY.

00:37:01.586 --> 00:37:04.288
MEAN THAT THE CONVERSION TO

00:37:04.355 --> 00:37:06.190
URBAN USES INCREASES GREENHOUSE

00:37:06.257 --> 00:37:09.026
GAS AMOUNTS BY THOSE AMOUNTS --

00:37:09.093 --> 00:37:11.028
THE MAGNITUDE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

00:37:11.095 --> 00:37:12.763
URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND AYE GLAND

00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:14.298
IS A STATIC NUMBER BASED ON THE

00:37:14.365 --> 00:37:15.800
EMISSIONS.

00:37:15.866 --> 00:37:17.835
OF URBAN AREAS IN CROP AREAS AT

00:37:17.902 --> 00:37:18.970
A GIVEN POINT IN TIME OF THE

00:37:19.036 --> 00:37:21.539
STUDIES WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO

00:37:21.606 --> 00:37:22.907
AND WE WILL ADD.

00:37:22.974 --> 00:37:24.742
POPULATION AND ECONOMIC

00:37:24.809 --> 00:37:25.376
ACTIVITIES THAT WE NEED TO LOOK

00:37:25.443 --> 00:37:28.412
AT WHERE THOSE THINGS GO --

00:37:28.479 --> 00:37:30.214
BECAUSE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

00:37:30.281 --> 00:37:32.116
FROM URBAN LAND USES ARE KNOWN

00:37:32.183 --> 00:37:32.950
TO VARY WITH THE DENSITY OF

00:37:33.017 --> 00:37:34.752
DEVELOPMENT.

00:37:34.819 --> 00:37:37.054
FUTURE CONCENTRATION OF ECONOMIC

00:37:37.121 --> 00:37:39.190
ACTIVITY WILL INFLUENCE WHAT

00:37:39.256 --> 00:37:41.225
PERCENT OF EMISSIONS WILL

00:37:41.292 --> 00:37:42.960
ACTUALLY BE AVOIDED SO IT'S ALL

00:37:43.027 --> 00:37:45.796
ABOUT WHERE AND HOW DENSE.

00:37:45.863 --> 00:37:47.898
LOW DENSITY DEVELOPMENT PRODUCES

00:37:47.965 --> 00:37:50.334
MORE GREENHOUSE GASES PER CAPITA

00:37:50.401 --> 00:37:51.168
THAN HIGH EFFICIENT.

00:37:51.235 --> 00:37:53.337
DENSITY DEVELOPMENT.

00:37:53.404 --> 00:37:54.238
SO LET'S THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE

00:37:54.305 --> 00:37:56.140
FOR A MINUTE AF T. SHOWS THAT

00:37:56.207 --> 00:37:59.043
WITH FUTURE COMPACT DEVELOPMENT --

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:02.113
THERE WOULD BE A 55% NET SAVINGS

00:38:02.179 --> 00:38:04.081
BETWEEN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

00:38:04.148 --> 00:38:06.584
AGRICULTURAL AND URBAN EMISSIONS

00:38:06.651 --> 00:38:08.285
AS A RESULT OF CONCENTRATING.

00:38:08.352 --> 00:38:09.687
OUR POPULATION ON FEWER ACRES OF

00:38:09.754 --> 00:38:11.355
LAND.

00:38:11.422 --> 00:38:13.591
IF WE WANT TO REDUCE EMISSIONS

00:38:13.658 --> 00:38:15.459
LOS STILL ALLOWING THE STATE TO

00:38:15.526 --> 00:38:17.161
EXPAND ITS ECONOMY AND AT THE

00:38:17.228 --> 00:38:19.096
SAME TIME SAVE OUR FARMLAND FROM

00:38:19.163 --> 00:38:20.765
BEING CONVERTED TO DEVELOPMENT

00:38:20.831 --> 00:38:22.099
WE MUST DEVELOP AT HIGHER

00:38:22.166 --> 00:38:26.270
DENSITIES --

00:38:26.337 --> 00:38:28.406
AND IF THE STATE AND ESPECIALLY

00:38:28.472 --> 00:38:30.708
LOCAL COMMUNITIES COMMIT TO

00:38:30.775 --> 00:38:32.009
BETTER PATTERNS OF DEVELOPMENT.

00:38:32.076 --> 00:38:35.146
I'M OUR RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT --

00:38:35.212 --> 00:38:38.215
WILL BE PUT OUT A GOAL AT IF.

00:38:38.282 --> 00:38:40.051
THE ANNUAL LOSS OF FARMLAND TO

00:38:40.117 --> 00:38:41.218
DEVELOPMENT IN CALIFORNIA

00:38:41.285 --> 00:38:44.555
RESERVE REDUCED BY 50% BY.

00:38:44.622 --> 00:38:47.324
TWENTY THIRTY AND 75% BY TWENTY

00:38:47.391 --> 00:38:47.825
FIFTY THAT WOULD BE THE

00:38:47.892 --> 00:38:50.061
EQUIVALENT OF TAKING TWO MILLION

00:38:50.127 --> 00:38:52.096
CARS OFF THE ROAD EVERY YEAR.

00:38:52.163 --> 00:38:54.031
REDUCING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED

00:38:54.098 --> 00:38:57.234
VICE SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY

00:38:57.301 --> 00:38:58.636
SEVEN BILLION MILES EVERY YEAR.

00:38:58.703 --> 00:39:00.871
AND SAVING ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED

00:39:00.938 --> 00:39:03.040
THOUSAND ACRES OF FARMLAND.

00:39:03.107 --> 00:39:04.508
THESE ARE ESTIMATES BASED ON OUR

00:39:04.575 --> 00:39:06.310
RESEARCH SHOWING THE MAGNITUDE

00:39:06.377 --> 00:39:08.145
DIFFERENCE OF GHG EMISSIONS

00:39:08.212 --> 00:39:09.213
BETWEEN URBAN AND AGRICULTURAL

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.748
LANDS.

00:39:10.815 --> 00:39:11.816
IF WE FOLLOW THE STATE'S

00:39:11.882 --> 00:39:14.719
TRAJECTORY.

00:39:14.785 --> 00:39:15.286
TO TWENTY THIRTY UP WE COULD

00:39:15.352 --> 00:39:17.354
MEET.

00:39:17.421 --> 00:39:18.255
GEE IT TO MEET ITS YET SHE

00:39:18.322 --> 00:39:19.957
REDUCTION GOALS THIS AMOUNT

00:39:20.024 --> 00:39:20.424
WOULD.

00:39:20.491 --> 00:39:23.394
EQUAL 18% OF THE STATE'S OVERALL

00:39:23.461 --> 00:39:25.696
GHG REDUCTION GOALS THAT'S

00:39:25.763 --> 00:39:27.832
THAT'S NOT NOTHING.

00:39:27.898 --> 00:39:29.767
AND SO IN REGARDS TO THAT IF IF

00:39:29.834 --> 00:39:31.135
I CAN ASK A REAL QUICK QUESTION

00:39:31.202 --> 00:39:33.671
WHAT ASSUMPTIONS DID YOU MAKE IN

00:39:33.738 --> 00:39:35.406
REGARDS TO THE TRANSPORTATION

00:39:35.473 --> 00:39:37.708
INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE IN THAT.

00:39:37.775 --> 00:39:39.577
URBAN AREA IT BECAUSE PART OF

00:39:39.643 --> 00:39:40.377
THE CHALLENGE [inaudible]

00:39:40.444 --> 00:39:42.413
IS THAT.

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:44.348
WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE WHEN

00:39:44.415 --> 00:39:44.849
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ACT

00:39:44.915 --> 00:39:45.783
CONVERSION?

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:46.851
YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT LOS

00:39:46.917 --> 00:39:48.552
ANGELES OAKLAND OR SAN FRANCISCO

00:39:48.619 --> 00:39:49.420
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT RURAL

00:39:49.487 --> 00:39:50.788
COMMUNITIES.

00:39:50.855 --> 00:39:52.523
AND WHEN YOU ASK THEM IF THEY'RE

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:53.457
INTERESTED IN INCREASING

00:39:53.524 --> 00:39:55.893
DENSITIES --

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.628
REDUCING.

00:39:57.695 --> 00:39:59.597
PARKING SPACES AND INCREASING

00:39:59.663 --> 00:40:01.365
THE INTENSITY OF DEVELOPMENT.

00:40:01.432 --> 00:40:02.733
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:03.701
THAT BECAUSE THERE ISN'T THE

00:40:03.768 --> 00:40:05.603
INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE.

00:40:05.669 --> 00:40:07.238
THERE IS IN THE TRANSPORTATION

00:40:07.304 --> 00:40:08.539
MOBILITY INFRASTRUCTURE SO I'M

00:40:08.606 --> 00:40:10.241
I'M WONDERING IF YOU MADE ANY

00:40:10.307 --> 00:40:11.542
ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THAT I DON'T

00:40:11.609 --> 00:40:13.043
DESERVE IT THE WAY THAT WE GOT

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:15.446
TO THAT 55% --

00:40:15.513 --> 00:40:17.548
WITH USING THEIR SAID SOFTWARE

00:40:17.615 --> 00:40:19.183
THAT HEALTH WORK ANALYTICS

00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:20.618
PRODUCE BECAUSE URBAN FOOTPRINT

00:40:20.684 --> 00:40:21.986
YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD OF THAT.

00:40:22.052 --> 00:40:23.154
AND SO THEY DO --

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:24.655
KIND OF REGIONAL URBAN PLANNING

00:40:24.722 --> 00:40:26.023
SCENARIO DEVELOPMENT USING G.

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:28.325
EACH G. IN A LOT OF OTHER --

00:40:28.392 --> 00:40:30.728
AT METRICS.

00:40:30.795 --> 00:40:31.796
I DON'T NO WHAT'S EMBEDDED IN

00:40:31.862 --> 00:40:34.431
THERE BUT THAT'S OUR

00:40:34.498 --> 00:40:35.933
AUTHORISATIONS BEATS AMERICA.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.436
AND THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT.

00:40:39.503 --> 00:40:41.639
I'M STILL OUR CALL TO ACTION IS

00:40:41.705 --> 00:40:43.073
TO SET STATEWIDE GOALS FOR

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:45.609
FARMING CONSERVATION THAT.

00:40:45.676 --> 00:40:49.346
THIRTY AT 50% BY 303075% BY

00:40:49.413 --> 00:40:49.947
TWENTY FIFTY OUT OF THE WAY I

00:40:50.014 --> 00:40:51.882
SEE IT IS THE SAME WAY THAT WE

00:40:51.949 --> 00:40:53.717
HAVE REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS

00:40:53.784 --> 00:40:55.085
ASSESSMENT THE ARENA.

00:40:55.152 --> 00:40:56.453
WHERE THE STATE MANDATES A

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:58.222
CERTAIN NUMBER OF HOUSING UNITS

00:40:58.289 --> 00:40:59.924
IN EVERY REGION MUST BE PLANNED

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:01.692
FOR HIM BELT WE SHOULD DO THE

00:41:01.759 --> 00:41:04.061
SAME FOR FARMING CONSERVATION --

00:41:04.128 --> 00:41:05.362
WE SHOULD REFORM PLANNING LAWS

00:41:05.429 --> 00:41:07.798
SO THAT COMMUNITIES CAN BETTER --

00:41:07.865 --> 00:41:09.834
REDUCE THEIR PER CAPITAL AND

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:11.635
CONSUMPTION FOR DEVELOPMENT --

00:41:11.702 --> 00:41:13.304
WHICH DEFINITELY INCLUDES MORE

00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:15.673
TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS I'M.

00:41:15.739 --> 00:41:18.275
WE SHOULD I ADOPT STATEWIDE --

00:41:18.342 --> 00:41:20.344
MITIGATION POLICIES SO THAT WE

00:41:20.411 --> 00:41:21.579
CAN BALANCE --

00:41:21.645 --> 00:41:24.915
BUT IS LOST IN FARMLAND --

00:41:24.982 --> 00:41:26.083
WE SHOULD PRIORITIZE THE

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:28.219
CONSERVATION OF THE HIGH QUALITY

00:41:28.285 --> 00:41:29.553
LAND GETTING BACK TO OUR SAN

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:30.754
JOAQUIN STUDY.

00:41:30.821 --> 00:41:31.388
AND WE SHOULD INCREASE FUNDING

00:41:31.455 --> 00:41:34.625
TO HELP SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT

00:41:34.692 --> 00:41:36.160
PRACTICES THAT --

00:41:36.227 --> 00:41:38.896
PRODUCED ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS

00:41:38.963 --> 00:41:39.196
[inaudible]

00:41:39.263 --> 00:41:40.698
THANK YOU.

THE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS OF

00:42:11.996 --> 00:42:12.696
AGRICULTURE IT'S SOMETHING OUR

00:42:12.763 --> 00:42:14.198
COALITION.

00:42:14.265 --> 00:42:16.333

POLICIES INCENTIVES AND

00:42:27.478 --> 00:42:29.246
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN PLACE.

00:42:29.313 --> 00:42:31.015
CALIFORNIA PRODUCERS CAN I DO

00:42:31.081 --> 00:42:32.416
ALL OF THE ABOVE SUSTAIN GLOBAL

00:42:32.483 --> 00:42:33.884
FOOD SECURITY PROTECT OUR

00:42:33.951 --> 00:42:35.719
NATURAL RESOURCES.

00:42:35.786 --> 00:42:36.787
PROVIDE FOR ECONOMICALLY VIBRANT

00:42:36.854 --> 00:42:38.756
RURAL COMMUNITIES AND MAINTAIN

00:42:38.822 --> 00:42:40.257
OUR OUR WORLD CLASS I GLANCE IF

00:42:40.324 --> 00:42:41.959
YOU JUST HEARD ABOUT.

00:42:42.026 --> 00:42:42.760
I MEAN AND THE INNOVATIVE

00:42:42.826 --> 00:42:44.194
PRODUCERS --

00:42:44.261 --> 00:42:45.162
IN OUR NETWORK OF PROVEN ALL OF

00:42:45.229 --> 00:42:47.698
THIS IS POSSIBLE.

00:42:47.765 --> 00:42:48.732
I'M SAID HIM AND TO TELL YOU

00:42:48.799 --> 00:42:50.067
ABOUT HOW CALIFORNIA IS SCALING

00:42:50.134 --> 00:42:51.602
UP THEIR INNOVATION.

00:42:51.669 --> 00:42:52.636
I AM BUT BEFORE I DO I FEEL I

00:42:52.703 --> 00:42:54.905
HAVE TO ADDRESS WHAT WE BELIEVE

00:42:54.972 --> 00:42:56.407
IS THE GREATEST THREAT TO

00:42:56.473 --> 00:42:57.741
AGRICULTURE AND THE ENVIRONMENT

00:42:57.808 --> 00:43:01.545
IN THE LONG TERM.

00:43:01.612 --> 00:43:03.347
SO AS YOU ALL WELL KNOW BECAUSE

00:43:03.414 --> 00:43:05.783
YOU'RE DEALING WITH IT RIGHT NOW --

00:43:05.849 --> 00:43:07.318
IN JUST THE PAST EIGHT YEARS

00:43:07.384 --> 00:43:08.953
WE'VE EXPERIENCED THE WORST

00:43:09.019 --> 00:43:11.322
DROUGHT SOME ST A MILLENNIUM.

00:43:11.388 --> 00:43:12.756
THE SECOND WETTEST WINTER ON

00:43:12.823 --> 00:43:14.725
RECORD AND OF COURSE A NUMBER OF

00:43:14.792 --> 00:43:16.093
THE STATE'S LARGEST AND MOST

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:18.629
DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRES.

00:43:18.696 --> 00:43:20.364
AND WE KEEP OUR BREAKING THE

00:43:20.431 --> 00:43:21.332
RECORDS THAT NO ONE WANTS TO

00:43:21.398 --> 00:43:22.466
BREAK [inaudible]

00:43:22.533 --> 00:43:26.270
RIGHT -- AND

00:43:26.337 --> 00:43:27.438
OF COURSE MANY FACTORS CAN

00:43:27.504 --> 00:43:29.573
EXPLAIN ANY SINGLE EVENTS OR

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:31.809
NATURAL DISASTER BUT IT'S VERY

00:43:31.875 --> 00:43:32.977
CLEAR THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS

00:43:33.043 --> 00:43:34.778
DIALING UP THE FREQUENCY AND AND

00:43:34.845 --> 00:43:37.948
THE INTENSITY OF ALL OF THESE.

00:43:38.015 --> 00:43:38.349
SO THESE HAVE --

00:43:38.415 --> 00:43:40.084
FAIRLY PROFOUND DE CONSEQUENCES

00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:41.452
FOR AGRICULTURE AS AN INDUSTRY

00:43:41.518 --> 00:43:44.488
DEPENDENT ON THE WEATHER --

00:43:44.555 --> 00:43:47.157
REFLECTING THIS THIS NEW REALITY --

00:43:47.224 --> 00:43:49.093
A YOU SEE PAPER PUBLISHED THIS

00:43:49.159 --> 00:43:51.528
SPRING BY SIX A UC RESEARCHERS

00:43:51.595 --> 00:43:51.829
[inaudible]

00:43:51.895 --> 00:43:53.564
PROJECTED THAT --

00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:54.832
IF CLIMATE CHANGE CONTINUES

00:43:54.898 --> 00:43:57.201
UNABATED BY TWENTY FIFTY YIELDS

00:43:57.267 --> 00:43:58.702
ARE PROJECTED TO DECLINE BY 40%

00:43:58.769 --> 00:44:00.437
FOR AVOCADOS.

00:44:00.504 --> 00:44:02.806
AND 20% FOR ALMONDS TABLE GRAPES

00:44:02.873 --> 00:44:04.808
ORANGES AND WALNUTS WHICH AS YOU

00:44:04.875 --> 00:44:06.343
NOTED TEAR AND SOME OF THE

00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:09.013
BIGGEST CROPS IN THE STATE.

00:44:09.079 --> 00:44:09.880
BY THE END OF THE CENTURY THAT

00:44:09.947 --> 00:44:11.415
THE PICTURE IS EVEN BLEAKER THE

00:44:11.482 --> 00:44:13.217
RESEARCHERS PROJECT A 50%

00:44:13.283 --> 00:44:14.318
INCREASE IN SEVERE DROUGHTS AND

00:44:14.385 --> 00:44:16.053
SEVERE FLOODS.

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:17.788
AND A POTENTIAL SIXTY FIVE LOS

00:44:17.855 --> 00:44:22.092
AT PERCENT LOSS IN OUR SNOWPACK --

00:44:22.159 --> 00:44:23.560
ALSO THERE BUT THAT'S ONLY A

00:44:23.627 --> 00:44:26.497
PARTIAL LIST --

00:44:26.563 --> 00:44:27.998
SO THIS IS THAT THE SLOW MOVING

00:44:28.065 --> 00:44:29.767
CRISIS FACING OUR INDUSTRY AND

00:44:29.833 --> 00:44:33.704
AND PARTICULARLY FACING --

00:44:33.771 --> 00:44:35.105
MY GENERATION OF FARMERS WHO

00:44:35.172 --> 00:44:36.040
HAFTED FOR PREPARE FOR THIS

00:44:36.106 --> 00:44:40.444
FEATURE.

00:44:40.511 --> 00:44:42.379
BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU A GOOD

00:44:42.446 --> 00:44:45.582
STORY -- SO

00:44:45.649 --> 00:44:47.017
WE BELIEVE THAT --

00:44:47.084 --> 00:44:48.352
THIS IS A CRISIS WE HAVE ALL OF

00:44:48.419 --> 00:44:50.687
THE TOOLS TO SOLVE.

00:44:50.754 --> 00:44:52.823
AND AGRICULTURE IN PARTICULAR.

00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:54.425
ARE HAS A UNIQUE ROLE TO PLAY

00:44:54.491 --> 00:44:54.725
[inaudible]

00:44:54.792 --> 00:44:56.660
WE HAVE.

00:44:56.727 --> 00:44:58.829
WHAT WE CALL ABUNDANT SOLUTIONS

00:44:58.896 --> 00:44:59.463
I'VE ASKED TO LOOK AT OF

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:01.231
PRACTICES?

00:45:01.298 --> 00:45:02.366
THAT WE'VE COLLECTIVELY DEEMED

00:45:02.433 --> 00:45:04.168
CLIMATE SMART AGRICULTURE.

00:45:04.234 --> 00:45:05.335
THAT BOTH ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSE

00:45:05.402 --> 00:45:07.371
OF CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:45:07.438 --> 00:45:08.672
AND ALSO IMPROVE THE RESILIENCE

00:45:08.739 --> 00:45:11.008
OF OUR FARMS AND RANCHES AND TO

00:45:11.075 --> 00:45:12.209
ITS IMMEDIATE IMPACTS THAT WE'RE

00:45:12.276 --> 00:45:14.344
EXPERIENCING NOW.

00:45:14.411 --> 00:45:15.679
AND MOST OF THESE PRACTICES ALSO

00:45:15.746 --> 00:45:16.847
HAVE ENVIRONMENTAL COULD

00:45:16.914 --> 00:45:19.249
BENEFITS WHICH I'LL TALK ABOUT.

00:45:19.316 --> 00:45:20.918
SO CALIFORNIA'S ACCELERATING

00:45:20.984 --> 00:45:22.052
THIS TRANSITION THE CLIMATE

00:45:22.119 --> 00:45:24.054
SMART I CAN FOUR WAYS.

00:45:24.121 --> 00:45:25.422
BUILDING HEALTHY SOILS SAVING

00:45:25.489 --> 00:45:27.057
WATER AND ENERGY.

00:45:27.124 --> 00:45:27.991
PRODUCING LIVESTOCK METHANE

00:45:28.058 --> 00:45:30.060
EMISSIONS AND CONSERVING AT RISK

00:45:30.127 --> 00:45:32.196
FARMLAND.

00:45:32.262 --> 00:45:33.497
I DON'T KNOW OTHERS ARE GOING TO

00:45:33.564 --> 00:45:34.665
ARE GOING TO COVER MOST OF THESE

00:45:34.731 --> 00:45:36.366
TOPICS AND IN MORE DETAIL.

00:45:36.433 --> 00:45:37.801
I'M SO I'M GONNA FOCUS MOSTLY ON

00:45:37.868 --> 00:45:39.036
HEALTHY SOILS ABOUT IT WILL

00:45:39.103 --> 00:45:41.939
TOUCH JUST BRIEFLY ON THE OTHERS

00:45:42.005 --> 00:45:42.239
[inaudible]

00:45:42.306 --> 00:45:44.741
SO.

00:45:44.808 --> 00:45:46.610
WIRE WE BUILDING HEALTHY SOILS

00:45:46.677 --> 00:45:47.211
AND WHAT IS THAT WHAT IS THAT

00:45:47.277 --> 00:45:48.512
EVEN MEAN [inaudible]

00:45:48.579 --> 00:45:49.880
WELL [inaudible]

00:45:49.947 --> 00:45:51.448
BY ADDING.

00:45:51.515 --> 00:45:52.583
A SMALL LAYER OF COMPOST AND

00:45:52.649 --> 00:45:55.752
MULCH PLANTING COVER CROPS.

00:45:55.819 --> 00:45:57.421
AND REDUCING TILLAGE YOU'RE

00:45:57.488 --> 00:45:59.189
INSTALLING VEGETATIVE BUFFERS ON

00:45:59.256 --> 00:46:00.757
THE EDGES OF FIELDS.

00:46:00.824 --> 00:46:02.726
ANYONE OF TWENTY PLUS PRACTICE

00:46:02.793 --> 00:46:04.194
IS THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD NAG AS

00:46:04.261 --> 00:46:05.229
HAS RECOGNIZED AS A HEALTHY

00:46:05.295 --> 00:46:07.364
CELLS PRACTICE.

00:46:07.431 --> 00:46:10.400
AND WE CAN IMPROVE THE THE

00:46:10.467 --> 00:46:11.735
FUNCTION --

00:46:11.802 --> 00:46:13.070
AND THE HEALTH OF THE BIOLOGY IN

00:46:13.137 --> 00:46:14.371
THE STRUCTURE IN THE SOIL.

00:46:14.438 --> 00:46:16.807
AND IN TURN.

00:46:16.874 --> 00:46:18.909
THAT TURNS ARE --

00:46:18.976 --> 00:46:21.178
OUR SOIL'S INTO SPONGES.

00:46:21.245 --> 00:46:22.646
THE USDA ESTIMATES THAT FOR

00:46:22.713 --> 00:46:24.047
EVERYONE PERCENT INCREASE AND

00:46:24.114 --> 00:46:26.617
SOIL ORGANIC MATTER.

00:46:26.683 --> 00:46:28.218
SO CAN ABSORB AND RETAIN AN

00:46:28.285 --> 00:46:30.120
ADDITIONAL TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND

00:46:30.187 --> 00:46:32.823
GALLONS OF WATER PER ACRE.

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:35.392
SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT HAS.

00:46:35.459 --> 00:46:36.560
AT POSITIVELY.

00:46:36.627 --> 00:46:38.462
IMPACTS ON DROUGHT RESILIENCE

00:46:38.529 --> 00:46:40.664
GROUNDWATER RECHARGE.

00:46:40.731 --> 00:46:41.999
AB REDUCED FLOOD RISK AND AND

00:46:42.065 --> 00:46:44.601
REDUCE SOIL EROSION.

00:46:44.668 --> 00:46:46.470
HEALTHY CELLS ALSO INCREASE A

00:46:46.537 --> 00:46:47.771
NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY TO THE

00:46:47.838 --> 00:46:48.972
PLANTS IN THERE FOR INCREASED

00:46:49.039 --> 00:46:52.643
THEIR HEALTH AND YIELDS.

00:46:52.709 --> 00:46:55.846
AND THEY DO ALL OF THIS THROUGH --

00:46:55.913 --> 00:46:56.914
PRETTY MAGICAL PROCESS CALLED

00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:59.516
PHOTOSYNTHESIS WHERE THEY TAKE

00:46:59.583 --> 00:47:01.151
CARMEN OUT OF THE ATMOSPHERE AND

00:47:01.218 --> 00:47:02.553
PUT IT IN THE FORM OF PLANT

00:47:02.619 --> 00:47:05.189
MATTER AND MICROBIAL AND THAT

00:47:05.255 --> 00:47:06.456
LIVING ORGANISMS.

00:47:06.523 --> 00:47:07.491
BENEATH HER FEET WHERE IT'S

00:47:07.558 --> 00:47:09.927
USEFUL AND PRODUCTIVE.

00:47:09.993 --> 00:47:11.395
I HAVE THIS PICTURE HERE IS OF

00:47:11.461 --> 00:47:13.096
SANDY MCGINNIS GARCIA SHE'S A

00:47:13.163 --> 00:47:15.098
FARMER IN WATSONVILLE AND ONE OF

00:47:15.165 --> 00:47:17.401
THE HUNDRED AND TWELVE FARMERS

00:47:17.467 --> 00:47:17.968
HAVE RECEIVED HEALTHY SOILS

00:47:18.035 --> 00:47:20.137
GRANTS.

00:47:20.204 --> 00:47:21.638
AND SHE SAYS THAT.

00:47:21.705 --> 00:47:22.940
WE CAN REDUCE OUR CARBON

00:47:23.006 --> 00:47:24.241
EMISSIONS AND FERTILIZER

00:47:24.308 --> 00:47:25.842
APPLICATIONS AND SAVE WATER AT

00:47:25.909 --> 00:47:27.477
THE TIME IT'S A WIN WIN WIN FOR

00:47:27.544 --> 00:47:30.781
FARMERS --

00:47:30.847 --> 00:47:31.782
THEY'RE GONNA BE A NUMBER OF

00:47:31.848 --> 00:47:33.150
OTHER PICTURES OF A FARMER'S ON

00:47:33.217 --> 00:47:34.685
MY IT NEXT SLIDES I'M I DON'T

00:47:34.751 --> 00:47:36.286
HAVE TIME. TO TO QUOTE ALL OF

00:47:36.353 --> 00:47:37.754
THEM ASSURE ALL OF THEIR STORIES

00:47:37.821 --> 00:47:39.056
BUT I WANT TO KNOW THAT

00:47:39.122 --> 00:47:40.958
AND WE HAVE THE STORIES OF SANDY

00:47:41.024 --> 00:47:42.559
AND THIRTY OTHER --

00:47:42.626 --> 00:47:44.194
FARMERS WHO RECEIVED CLIENTS

00:47:44.261 --> 00:47:45.963
MIGHT AYE GRANTS ON OUR WEBSITES

00:47:46.029 --> 00:47:48.098
AND SCRUBBING THEIR PROJECTS

00:47:48.165 --> 00:47:49.066
THEIR MOTIVATIONS AND AND THEIR

00:47:49.132 --> 00:47:51.034
QUOTES.

00:47:51.101 --> 00:47:51.668
AND CENTER TRUCKS TO CHECK THAT

00:47:51.735 --> 00:47:55.505
OUT.

00:47:55.572 --> 00:47:56.773
SO WHAT IS THE STATUS OF HEALTHY

00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:57.774
CELLS PRACTICE ADOPTION IN THE

00:47:57.841 --> 00:48:00.711
STATE -- WE

00:48:00.777 --> 00:48:03.013
RECENTLY COMPILED DATA --

00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:04.848
ON THIS QUESTION TO HELP INFORM

00:48:04.915 --> 00:48:07.351
THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD* OWN

00:48:07.417 --> 00:48:08.986
WORKINGMAN'S IMPLEMENTATION PLAN.

00:48:09.052 --> 00:48:10.287
THIS IS THE PLAN WHICH WILL SET

00:48:10.354 --> 00:48:12.456
A TARGET --

00:48:12.522 --> 00:48:13.590
FOR WHAT AGRICULTURE CAN

00:48:13.657 --> 00:48:14.625
CONTRIBUTE TO THE STATE'S

00:48:14.691 --> 00:48:18.028
OVERALL CLIMATE STRATEGY BY.

00:48:18.095 --> 00:48:18.662
TWENTY THIRTY AND SO ALL THIS

00:48:18.729 --> 00:48:20.397
HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF A THE STATS

00:48:20.464 --> 00:48:22.866
THAT WE WE FOUND --

00:48:22.933 --> 00:48:25.002
APPROXIMATELY 6% OF ALMOND

00:48:25.068 --> 00:48:26.870
ACREAGE IN THE STATE IS ALREADY

00:48:26.937 --> 00:48:28.872
USING COVER CROPS.

00:48:28.939 --> 00:48:30.741
ABOUT 10% OF THE FARMS IN THE

00:48:30.807 --> 00:48:33.176
STATE USE CONSERVATION TILLAGE.

00:48:33.243 --> 00:48:35.879
OUR A WHOPPING 95% OF VINEYARDS --

00:48:35.946 --> 00:48:37.014
ALREADY IS COVER CROPS REPLY

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:39.116
COMPOST.

00:48:39.182 --> 00:48:41.818
AT JUST OVER THREE HUNDRED

00:48:41.885 --> 00:48:42.619
THIRTY THOUSAND CROPLAND ACRES

00:48:42.686 --> 00:48:44.454
ARE CERTIFIED ORGANIC WHICH

00:48:44.521 --> 00:48:46.790
MEANS AND THEY'RE USING MULTIPLE

00:48:46.857 --> 00:48:48.125
HEALTHY CELLS PRACTICES.

00:48:48.191 --> 00:48:49.359
AND THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE ORGANIC

00:48:49.426 --> 00:48:51.228
RANGE LAND.

00:48:51.295 --> 00:48:53.930
AND FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND ACRES --

00:48:53.997 --> 00:48:55.165
IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WERE UNDER

00:48:55.232 --> 00:48:56.833
NRCS EQUAL CONTRACT TO IMPLEMENT

00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:59.202
SO HEALTH PRACTICES.

00:48:59.269 --> 00:49:01.271
SO WHEN WE HAD ALL OF THAT UP WE

00:49:01.338 --> 00:49:02.139
COME UP WITH A CONSERVATIVE

00:49:02.205 --> 00:49:03.507
ESTIMATE --

00:49:03.573 --> 00:49:05.275
THAT APPROXIMATELY SIX HUNDRED

00:49:05.342 --> 00:49:06.009
THOUSAND ACRES ARE CURRENTLY

00:49:06.076 --> 00:49:09.780
USING HEALTHY SO AS PRACTICES.

00:49:09.846 --> 00:49:10.747
SO WHAT IS THE STATE DOING TO

00:49:10.814 --> 00:49:13.350
WRAP THAT UP.

00:49:13.417 --> 00:49:14.718
I WELL IT'S PRIMARILY INVESTING

00:49:14.785 --> 00:49:17.387
AT YOU ALL I HAVE INVESTED IN.

00:49:17.454 --> 00:49:18.822
A THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND

00:49:18.889 --> 00:49:19.690
AGRICULTURE'S HEALTHY CELLS

00:49:19.756 --> 00:49:21.692
PROGRAM.

00:49:21.758 --> 00:49:23.026
OUR THIS PROGRAM DIRECTLY

00:49:23.093 --> 00:49:25.762
INCENTIVIZE FARMERS TO A TRYOUT

00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:27.564
AND ADOPT THESE NEW PRACTICES.

00:49:27.631 --> 00:49:29.599
IT GIVES AN A THREE YEAR WINDOW

00:49:29.666 --> 00:49:30.167
TO TO FIGURE IT OUT MAKE IT

00:49:30.233 --> 00:49:33.170
SUCCESSFUL --

00:49:33.236 --> 00:49:34.604
AND SO FAR THERE'S A THAT MONEY

00:49:34.671 --> 00:49:36.273
IS GONE TWO HUNDRED TWELVE

00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:36.773
PROJECTS AND THIRTY FIVE

00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:38.575
COUNTIES.

00:49:38.642 --> 00:49:40.877
AND I DON'T ESPECIALLY NO --

00:49:40.944 --> 00:49:41.411
TWENTY EIGHT OF THOSE ARE

00:49:41.478 --> 00:49:43.280
DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS.

00:49:43.347 --> 00:49:46.049
WHICH ARE UNIQUE HAVE BECAUSE

00:49:46.116 --> 00:49:49.286
THEY THEY CREATE OPPORTUNITY FOR

00:49:49.353 --> 00:49:50.887
FARMERS TO LEARN THE WAY.

00:49:50.954 --> 00:49:52.756
FARMERS RANCHERS LEARN BEST AND

00:49:52.823 --> 00:49:54.858
THEY REQUIRE THAT HUNDRED TWENTY

00:49:54.925 --> 00:49:55.926
FARMERS OVER THREE YEARS VISIT

00:49:55.992 --> 00:49:57.194
THE SITE.

00:49:57.260 --> 00:49:59.429
AND LEARN FROM WHAT THE FARMER

00:49:59.496 --> 00:50:01.298
AND HOST IS DOING.

00:50:01.365 --> 00:50:02.966
BLOCKING THAT FENCE LINES

00:50:03.033 --> 00:50:04.401
KICKING THE DIRT --

00:50:04.468 --> 00:50:06.837
TALKING SHOP ABOUT PRACTICES AND

00:50:06.903 --> 00:50:07.704
SO I THINK THAT'S REALLY

00:50:07.771 --> 00:50:08.171
IMPORTANT --

00:50:08.238 --> 00:50:09.439
COMPONENT AND INNOVATION FOR

00:50:09.506 --> 00:50:11.041
THIS PROGRAM.

00:50:11.108 --> 00:50:12.175
AND OF COURSE THIS IS ALREADY

00:50:12.242 --> 00:50:13.777
HAVING IMPACTS --

00:50:13.844 --> 00:50:16.513
YOU CAN SEE THAT YOUR ACTIONS --

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:18.081
THOSE ARE ANNUAL SO THOSE WILL

00:50:18.148 --> 00:50:19.116
CONTINUE --

00:50:19.182 --> 00:50:22.919
TO TO ACCUMULATE OVER TIME --

00:50:22.986 --> 00:50:24.254
SO WE ALSO WANTED TO ANSWER THE

00:50:24.321 --> 00:50:25.355
QUESTION WHAT KIND OF IMPACT

00:50:25.422 --> 00:50:28.024
COULD THIS PROGRAM HAVE BY.

00:50:28.091 --> 00:50:28.859
TWENTY THIRTY AND SO WE LOOKED

00:50:28.925 --> 00:50:32.396
AT TWO SCENARIOS A LOW AND HIGH --

00:50:32.462 --> 00:50:34.731
AND BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF OF

00:50:34.798 --> 00:50:35.966
THE FIRST ROUND OF THE PROGRAM.

00:50:36.032 --> 00:50:37.267
AYE WE ESTIMATE THAT IF IF THE

00:50:37.334 --> 00:50:38.702
STATE INVESTED TWENTY FIVE

00:50:38.769 --> 00:50:39.770
MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN THIS

00:50:39.836 --> 00:50:41.438
PROGRAM --

00:50:41.505 --> 00:50:44.040
WE'D ACHIEVE AN ADDITIONAL THREE

00:50:44.107 --> 00:50:44.674
NINE THIRTY THOUSAND TWO MILLION

00:50:44.741 --> 00:50:45.942
ACRES.

00:50:46.009 --> 00:50:47.144
UNDER HEALTHY CELLS --

00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:50.080
MANAGEMENT BY --

00:50:50.147 --> 00:50:50.647
TWENTY THIRTY AND THE RANGE

00:50:50.714 --> 00:50:53.150
THEIR REFLECTS OR OR DEPENDS ON

00:50:53.216 --> 00:50:54.951
EXTENT WHICH FARMERS APPLY FOR

00:50:55.018 --> 00:50:56.086
AND MULTIPLE PRACTICES OR JUST

00:50:56.153 --> 00:50:58.522
WANTED TIME.

00:50:58.588 --> 00:50:59.890
I AM YOU COULD SEE THAT IN THE

00:50:59.956 --> 00:51:01.691
FIFTY MILLION A SCENARIO I WOULD

00:51:01.758 --> 00:51:03.393
BE INCREASING THE ACREAGE BY A

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:04.628
SIX AND SIXTY TO TWO MILLION

00:51:04.694 --> 00:51:09.099
ACRES -- BUT

00:51:09.166 --> 00:51:10.267
ALL NOTE AGAIN THAT WHEN

00:51:10.333 --> 00:51:11.301
CONSIDERING THE IMPACTS OF

00:51:11.368 --> 00:51:12.636
DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS AND THE

00:51:12.702 --> 00:51:14.671
GROWING BODY OF RESEARCH --

00:51:14.738 --> 00:51:15.772
POINTING TO THE VALUE OF THESE

00:51:15.839 --> 00:51:17.941
PROGRAMS OF THESE PRACTICES AND

00:51:18.008 --> 00:51:18.575
WE DO THINK THE ADOPTION RATE

00:51:18.642 --> 00:51:20.677
WILL ACCELERATE AND AND GROW

00:51:20.744 --> 00:51:23.547
MUCH BEYOND THAT.

00:51:23.613 --> 00:51:26.116
I AM SEMINAR BREEZE THROUGH A

00:51:26.183 --> 00:51:27.184
ACTION ON THESE OF WHAT'S THE

00:51:27.250 --> 00:51:29.319
BIGGEST COST TO THESE PROGRAMS

00:51:29.386 --> 00:51:30.787
IS IT THE MATERIAL.

00:51:30.854 --> 00:51:32.622
VISIT THE APPLICATION IS IT THE

00:51:32.689 --> 00:51:34.024
INFORMATION I MEAN WHAT WHAT

00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:34.958
WHAT.

00:51:35.025 --> 00:51:36.660
WHAT IS THE MONEY GOING TO DO I

00:51:36.726 --> 00:51:37.727
GUESS SYSTEM [inaudible]

00:51:37.794 --> 00:51:41.498
YEAH -- SO.

00:51:41.565 --> 00:51:42.766
MATERIALS AND THE LABOR OF THE

00:51:42.833 --> 00:51:46.303
IMPLEMENTATION.

00:51:46.369 --> 00:51:47.237
I WENT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE

00:51:47.304 --> 00:51:49.639
DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS AND THEIR

00:51:49.706 --> 00:51:50.807
THEY GET SOME PORTION FUNDING TO

00:51:50.874 --> 00:51:54.945
DO OUTREACH AND EDUCATE --

00:51:55.011 --> 00:51:55.979
SANDERS GOING TO BREEZE THROUGH

00:51:56.046 --> 00:51:57.280
THESE OTHER THREE BECAUSE OTHER

00:51:57.347 --> 00:51:57.881
FOLKS I THINK WE'LL TALK MORE

00:51:57.948 --> 00:51:59.983
ABOUT THESE --

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:01.718
OF COURSE CALIFORNIA IS WISELY

00:52:01.785 --> 00:52:03.286
ACCELERATING --

00:52:03.353 --> 00:52:04.254
INVESTMENTS TO SAY WATER AND

00:52:04.321 --> 00:52:05.956
ENERGY ON FARMS.

00:52:06.022 --> 00:52:07.457
THE STATE WATER EFFICIENCY

00:52:07.524 --> 00:52:09.626
ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM OR SWEEP --

00:52:09.693 --> 00:52:12.062
HAS INVESTED IN SIX HUNDRED

00:52:12.128 --> 00:52:12.696
FOURTEEN PROJECTS ACROSS THIRTY

00:52:12.762 --> 00:52:15.165
THREE COUNTIES --

00:52:15.232 --> 00:52:17.400
IT'S EXTREMELY EXTREMELY POPULAR --

00:52:17.467 --> 00:52:18.668
APPLICATIONS FOR FARMERS

00:52:18.735 --> 00:52:20.337
OUTNUMBER AWARDS BY NEARLY THREE

00:52:20.403 --> 00:52:22.806
TO ONE RATIO --

00:52:22.873 --> 00:52:24.407
AND IT'S ALREADY HAVING A

00:52:24.474 --> 00:52:27.077
SIGNIFICANT AND WATER SAVINGS.

00:52:27.143 --> 00:52:28.245
FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW HOW TO

00:52:28.311 --> 00:52:30.013
IMAGINE SEVENTY ONE THOUSAND

00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:31.047
ACRE FEET YOUR HEAD IT'S ROUGHLY

00:52:31.114 --> 00:52:32.983
EQUIVALENT TO THIRTY FIVE

00:52:33.049 --> 00:52:33.617
THOUSAND OLYMPICS WHEN SWIMMING

00:52:33.683 --> 00:52:35.652
POOLS.

00:52:35.719 --> 00:52:37.287
THAT'S NOT EASY TO IMAGINE

00:52:37.354 --> 00:52:40.957
EITHER BUT I SO WERE ALSO A

00:52:41.024 --> 00:52:41.825
REDUCING LIVESTOCK METHANE

00:52:41.892 --> 00:52:43.126
EMISSIONS --

00:52:43.193 --> 00:52:44.194
I THINK SOMEONE ELSE IS GOING TO

00:52:44.261 --> 00:52:45.629
TALK ABOUT I JUST YEARS I'M I'M

00:52:45.695 --> 00:52:46.463
JUST GONNA TALK ABOUT THE

00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:47.631
ALTERNATE MANURE MANAGEMENT

00:52:47.697 --> 00:52:49.733
PROGRAM BECAUSE AND THE PROJECTS

00:52:49.799 --> 00:52:51.067
IT FUNDS ARE THE ONES THAT WORK

00:52:51.134 --> 00:52:52.702
FOR AND THE PRIMARILY SMALL AND

00:52:52.769 --> 00:52:55.872
MID SKILLED AREAS IN OUR NETWORK --

00:52:55.939 --> 00:52:56.806
SO.

00:52:56.873 --> 00:52:58.375
IT JUST IN ITS FIRST ROUND LAST

00:52:58.441 --> 00:52:59.142
YEAR THIRTY FOUR MILLION WAS

00:52:59.209 --> 00:53:01.011
REQUESTED AT TWENTY FOUR MILLION

00:53:01.077 --> 00:53:01.545
WAS AWARDED TO SEVENTEEN

00:53:01.611 --> 00:53:03.613
PROJECTS --

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:05.749
AND BECAUSE NOTHING IS --

00:53:05.815 --> 00:53:06.449
THIRTY TO EIGHTY TIMES MORE

00:53:06.516 --> 00:53:07.751
POTENT CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS

00:53:07.817 --> 00:53:09.719
REDUCTIONS --

00:53:09.786 --> 00:53:10.487
FROM FROM THE SERVER ARE PRETTY

00:53:10.554 --> 00:53:13.123
IMMENSE --

00:53:13.189 --> 00:53:14.024
THE OTHER BENEFITS OF THIS

00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:15.926
PROGRAM ARE THAT --

00:53:15.992 --> 00:53:17.894
WHEN YOU WHEN YOU CONVERT A

00:53:17.961 --> 00:53:19.663
MANURE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FROM A

00:53:19.729 --> 00:53:21.498
WET SYSTEM TO DRY SYSTEM?

00:53:21.565 --> 00:53:23.967
AND YOU'RE SEPARATING SOLIDS AND

00:53:24.034 --> 00:53:26.002
IN MOST CASES THERE COMPOSTING

00:53:26.069 --> 00:53:26.636
THEM IN APPLYING THEM BACK TO

00:53:26.703 --> 00:53:27.871
THE LAND --

00:53:27.938 --> 00:53:30.073
SO THAT'S INCREASING NUTRIENTS

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:31.107
AVAILABILITY FOR FORAGE AND FEED

00:53:31.174 --> 00:53:33.710
CROPS -- IT

00:53:33.777 --> 00:53:37.280
ALSO PAYS FOR PRACTICES TO GET --

00:53:37.347 --> 00:53:38.682
LIVESTOCK AND A COMPOST PACKED

00:53:38.748 --> 00:53:40.283
BARNES AND WHICH THERE'S

00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:40.817
RESEARCH SHOWING IMPROVES

00:53:40.884 --> 00:53:42.852
LIVESTOCK HEALTH --

00:53:42.919 --> 00:53:45.589
AND ALSO OUT IN THE PASTURE --

00:53:45.655 --> 00:53:47.490
AND BY SWITCHING TO A DRY SYSTEM

00:53:47.557 --> 00:53:49.059
ALSO REDUCING WATER USE A PRETTY

00:53:49.125 --> 00:53:49.726
SIGNIFICANT [inaudible]

00:53:49.793 --> 00:53:52.829
SO.

00:53:52.896 --> 00:53:54.230
AND THEN LASTLY WE JUST HEARD

00:53:54.297 --> 00:53:55.899
ALL OF THE REASONS WE SHOULD BE

00:53:55.966 --> 00:53:58.068
CONSERVING AT RISK FARMLANDS --

00:53:58.134 --> 00:53:59.069
I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT THE

00:53:59.135 --> 00:54:01.004
SUSTAINABLE AG LANDS

00:54:01.071 --> 00:54:03.506
CONSERVATION PROGRAM OR SELL --

00:54:03.573 --> 00:54:05.475
HAS CONSERVE FARM AND OTHER

00:54:05.542 --> 00:54:07.911
REMARKABLY FAST CLIP COMPARED TO

00:54:07.978 --> 00:54:09.846
PREVIOUS CONSERVATION PROGRAMS.

00:54:09.913 --> 00:54:11.181
I JUST THREE YEARS IT'S

00:54:11.247 --> 00:54:12.816
PERMANENTLY PROTECTED EIGHTY

00:54:12.882 --> 00:54:13.383
THOUSAND ACRES AND FIFTY TWO

00:54:13.450 --> 00:54:14.584
EASEMENTS [inaudible]

00:54:14.651 --> 00:54:18.455
AND THIS ALSO PAYS FOR TOUCHING

00:54:18.521 --> 00:54:20.323
ON THE LAND USE PLANNING PIECE

00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:22.525
THAT'S THAT ESRI MENTIONED --

00:54:22.592 --> 00:54:24.461
IT ALSO PAYS FOR A STRATEGY AND

00:54:24.527 --> 00:54:25.862
PLANNING GRANTS FOR CITIES AND

00:54:25.929 --> 00:54:27.130
COUNTIES TO COME UP WITH THEIR

00:54:27.197 --> 00:54:29.566
OWN POLICY IDEAS AND ORDINANCES --

00:54:29.633 --> 00:54:30.867
THAT WILL.

00:54:30.934 --> 00:54:32.002
ADD DRIVE DEVELOPMENT AWAY FROM

00:54:32.068 --> 00:54:36.406
OUR PRIME PRIME FARMLAND --

00:54:36.473 --> 00:54:44.147
SO. TO WRAP UP --

00:54:44.214 --> 00:54:45.248
THE THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE WE

00:54:45.315 --> 00:54:46.983
ALL FEEL IT EVEN IF EVEN IF SOME

00:54:47.050 --> 00:54:49.085
FARMERS DON'T.

00:54:49.152 --> 00:54:50.954
SAY CALLED BY THAT NAME EVERY

00:54:51.021 --> 00:54:52.322
FARMER HAS A STORY OF HOW THEY

00:54:52.389 --> 00:54:53.356
FACE SOMETHING THAT THEY'VE

00:54:53.423 --> 00:54:54.958
NEVER SEEN BEFORE --

00:54:55.025 --> 00:54:57.994
INNER IN RECENT HISTORY --

00:54:58.061 --> 00:54:59.696
AND SO THAT THE THREAT IS IS

00:54:59.763 --> 00:55:01.464
SERIOUS AND IT'S NOW.

00:55:01.531 --> 00:55:02.432
AMEND WE'VE A LOT TO LOSE IF WE

00:55:02.499 --> 00:55:04.601
DON'T HAVE TO ACT QUICKLY.

00:55:04.668 --> 00:55:06.403
AND YET WE ALSO HAVE SO MUCH TO

00:55:06.469 --> 00:55:08.605
GAIN IF WE ARE TO FULLY INVEST

00:55:08.672 --> 00:55:09.906
AND IMPLEMENT.

00:55:09.973 --> 00:55:11.474
THESE KIND OF SMART AGRICULTURAL

00:55:11.541 --> 00:55:12.275
SOLUTIONS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO

00:55:12.342 --> 00:55:13.610
HEAR HON EVER ON TALK ABOUT

00:55:13.677 --> 00:55:14.911
TODAY -- AND

00:55:14.978 --> 00:55:17.947
SO I IN THINKING ABOUT THE NEXT

00:55:18.014 --> 00:55:19.582
LEGISLATIVE SESSION WITH A NEW

00:55:19.649 --> 00:55:21.051
GOVERNOR --

00:55:21.117 --> 00:55:22.852
AND WHAT LOOKS LIKE INCREASING

00:55:22.919 --> 00:55:24.621
CAP AND TRADE REVENUE WE THINK

00:55:24.688 --> 00:55:25.822
THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE

00:55:25.889 --> 00:55:27.624
LEGISLATURE TO RE PRIORITIZE

00:55:27.691 --> 00:55:29.059
THESE MULTI BENEFIT.

00:55:29.125 --> 00:55:31.761
AGRICULTURAL SOLUTIONS AND AND

00:55:31.828 --> 00:55:32.929
IN THEIR LEGISLATIVE A

00:55:32.996 --> 00:55:35.899
EXPENDITURE PLAN --

00:55:35.965 --> 00:55:38.068
SO WITH THAT I'LL.

00:55:38.134 --> 00:55:39.002
THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE

00:55:39.069 --> 00:55:41.137
OPPORTUNITY AND COSMIC QUESTIONS.

00:55:41.204 --> 00:55:42.572
GREAT CONCLUSION THAT'S REALLY

00:55:42.639 --> 00:55:44.340
THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF THIS

00:55:44.407 --> 00:55:45.842
COMMITTEE IS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

00:55:45.909 --> 00:55:47.510
CAN WE BE DOING BETTER.

00:55:47.577 --> 00:55:50.146
AND AS WE FOCUS ON THAT.

00:55:50.213 --> 00:55:52.348
UTILIZING OUR PRECIOUS FARMLAND

00:55:52.415 --> 00:55:53.883
TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS LET ME

00:55:53.950 --> 00:55:54.551
SEE IF.

00:55:54.617 --> 00:55:55.485
SOME OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS

00:55:55.552 --> 00:55:57.187
HAVE QUESTIONS MISS AGUIAR-CURRY

00:55:57.253 --> 00:55:58.688
SURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE

00:55:58.755 --> 00:56:00.690
PRESENTATION I AM HER PERCENT

00:56:00.757 --> 00:56:02.092
BEHIND THIS I WORKED AGAINST

00:56:02.158 --> 00:56:03.159
FUNDING FOR YOU LAST YEAR.

00:56:03.226 --> 00:56:04.627
HAVEN'T ALWAYS BEEN SUCCESSFUL

00:56:04.694 --> 00:56:05.929
BUT I THINK PEOPLE JUST NOT

00:56:05.995 --> 00:56:08.531
AWARE OF THE BENEFITS OF THESE

00:56:08.598 --> 00:56:10.800
PROJECTS THESE ARE REALLY ON THE

00:56:10.867 --> 00:56:13.169
GROUND AND THEY WORK PROJECTS --

00:56:13.236 --> 00:56:14.771
LIKE YOU SAID IN A SWEEP THERE'S

00:56:14.838 --> 00:56:15.739
MANY PEOPLE THAT WANT TO

00:56:15.805 --> 00:56:17.640
PARTICIPATE IN THE PROJECT AND

00:56:17.707 --> 00:56:18.742
WE CAN'T ACCOMMODATE EVERYONE

00:56:18.808 --> 00:56:20.577
AND I WISH WE COULD --

00:56:20.643 --> 00:56:22.445
BUT I'M ALT CONTINUE TO BE A

00:56:22.512 --> 00:56:23.646
CHAMPION TO TRY TO MAKE SURE

00:56:23.713 --> 00:56:24.948
THAT THESE PROJECTS WORKS.

00:56:25.014 --> 00:56:26.516
I GOT MANY PHONE CALLS AMERICAN

00:56:26.583 --> 00:56:29.853
FARMLAND THESE THAT OF PEOPLE

00:56:29.919 --> 00:56:31.454
GIVE ME A CALL AND I THOUGHT

00:56:31.521 --> 00:56:33.690
THAT ONE OF THE MOST COMPELLING

00:56:33.757 --> 00:56:36.292
ONES OF THAT I HAD AS I OWNING A

00:56:36.359 --> 00:56:38.762
RANCH IN THE MY FATHER FARMED

00:56:38.828 --> 00:56:39.262
FOR YEARS AND HE DID IT.

00:56:39.329 --> 00:56:40.463
HIS WAY.

00:56:40.530 --> 00:56:41.598
AND NOW THE FAMILIES ACTUALLY

00:56:41.664 --> 00:56:43.600
TALKING ABOUT HEALTHY SOILS AND

00:56:43.666 --> 00:56:45.168
HOW DO WE ACTUALLY PUT A COVER

00:56:45.235 --> 00:56:46.703
CROP IN THE WALLET ORCHARD OR

00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:48.538
HOW WE GONNA REPLACE ALL PART OF

00:56:48.605 --> 00:56:49.773
THE WALL WITH THE ORCHARD HOW DO

00:56:49.839 --> 00:56:51.040
WE MAKE THE SOIL.

00:56:51.107 --> 00:56:52.408
SO IT'S BETTER FOR THE

00:56:52.475 --> 00:56:53.743
ENVIRONMENT AS WELL AS FOR THE

00:56:53.810 --> 00:56:55.378
OF THE PLANT SO ANYWAY THANK YOU

00:56:55.445 --> 00:56:57.180
VERY MUCH FOR PRESENTATION --

00:56:57.247 --> 00:56:58.882
RIGHT ON KEEP WORKING HARD ON

00:56:58.948 --> 00:57:00.517
THIS BECAUSE WE GET THERE WE GET

00:57:00.583 --> 00:57:02.585
EVERYBODY EDUCATED ON HOW

00:57:02.652 --> 00:57:04.454
IMPORTANT THIS IS THANK YOU.

00:57:04.521 --> 00:57:05.555
VERY GOOD ANYONE ELSE HAVE ANY

00:57:05.622 --> 00:57:09.959
QUESTIONS COMMENTS.

00:57:10.026 --> 00:57:11.494
SO THE ONLY THE ONLY COMMENT I

00:57:11.561 --> 00:57:12.629
HAVE IN TERMS OF THE GOALS FOR

00:57:12.695 --> 00:57:16.766
THE FARMLAND TRUST IS --

00:57:16.833 --> 00:57:18.401
AT THE WHOLE ISSUE OF

00:57:18.468 --> 00:57:23.773
TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS --

00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:24.741
IN.

00:57:24.808 --> 00:57:27.544
THAT OUR CURRENT SYSTEM DOESN'T.

00:57:27.610 --> 00:57:29.512
INCENTIVIZE BUILDING THE

00:57:29.579 --> 00:57:30.780
INFRASTRUCTURE TO RURAL OR

00:57:30.847 --> 00:57:32.215
SUBURBAN AREAS.

00:57:32.282 --> 00:57:34.217
AND I THINK IT'S IT'S THE

00:57:34.284 --> 00:57:34.984
MISSING PIECE IS THAT

00:57:35.051 --> 00:57:35.285
[inaudible]

00:57:35.351 --> 00:57:37.453
IS.

00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:39.823
IF WAY DON'T DO IT RIGHT THAN

00:57:39.889 --> 00:57:40.390
PEOPLE JUST MOVE FURTHER AND

00:57:40.456 --> 00:57:41.391
FURTHER OUT.

00:57:41.457 --> 00:57:43.793
AND THEN THEN WE DON'T WE LOSE

00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:45.094
THE BENEFIT OF THE CREEK

00:57:45.161 --> 00:57:46.930
GREENHOUSE GAS CLOSE CLOSE AND

00:57:46.996 --> 00:57:49.732
SO -- IT

00:57:49.799 --> 00:57:50.400
IT'S GOING TO BECOME

00:57:50.466 --> 00:57:51.935
INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT THAT ANY

00:57:52.001 --> 00:57:54.504
URBANIZATION INCLUDE ANY

00:57:54.571 --> 00:57:55.271
CONNECTION.

00:57:55.338 --> 00:57:58.474
WE START ADDING THE CONNECTIONS --

00:57:58.541 --> 00:58:00.243
FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SO

00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:02.478
THAT WE CAN ENCOURAGE --

00:58:02.545 --> 00:58:04.447
THAT THE DENSER BUILDING.

00:58:04.514 --> 00:58:06.983
WITH THE REDUCTION IN PARKING.

00:58:07.050 --> 00:58:09.452
AND AND WE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO

00:58:09.519 --> 00:58:10.887
GET OUT OF THEIR VEHICLES SINGLE

00:58:10.954 --> 00:58:13.122
OCCUPANCY VEHICLES ARE JUST WHAT

00:58:13.189 --> 00:58:14.691
WE NEED TO MAKE THAT SHIFT IN.

00:58:14.757 --> 00:58:15.625
HOW WE DO IT IS WITH GOOD

00:58:15.692 --> 00:58:17.193
PLANNING I GUESS THAT'S THAT

00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:18.294
THAT'S MY BIG POINT AND I KEEP

YEAH AS AS WE FARM AND WE'VE

01:00:40.236 --> 01:00:41.137
BEEN FARMING THE SAME GROUND FOR

01:00:41.204 --> 01:00:42.538
SO LONG THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

01:00:42.605 --> 01:00:45.408
CHANGES AND HOW AGRICULTURE HAS.

01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:47.777
EXISTED IN CALIFORNIA NOT ALONE

01:00:47.844 --> 01:00:49.679
LET ALONE THAT TYPES OF CROPS

01:00:49.746 --> 01:00:51.514
THAT WE HAVE FARM ABOUT HOW WE

01:00:51.581 --> 01:00:52.882
ARE FARMING IT.

01:00:52.949 --> 01:00:55.018
AND A BIG PART OF THAT HIS LEAD

01:00:55.084 --> 01:00:57.253
TOWARDS SOME VAST IMPROVEMENTS

01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:58.721
IN AGRICULTURE'S ROLE IN THE

01:00:58.788 --> 01:01:00.089
ENVIRONMENT --

01:01:00.156 --> 01:01:01.691
WE WE TALK A LITTLE BIT EARLIER

01:01:01.758 --> 01:01:02.859
ABOUT -- THE

01:01:02.925 --> 01:01:04.727
EARLIER PANEL TALKED ABOUT WATER

01:01:04.794 --> 01:01:07.730
EFFICIENCY ON OUR FARM ALONE --

01:01:07.797 --> 01:01:09.399
WE HAVE BIT STARTED --

01:01:09.465 --> 01:01:11.100
IMPLEMENTING SOME --

01:01:11.167 --> 01:01:12.869
PROCESSES TO INCREASE OUR WATER

01:01:12.935 --> 01:01:14.370
EFFICIENCY WHEN I WAS YOUNGER WE

01:01:14.437 --> 01:01:17.273
USED TO USE ALL FLOOD IRRIGATION --%

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:18.708
ON OUR FARM AND THAT STARTED TO

01:01:18.775 --> 01:01:20.109
CHANGE WE STILL HAVE SOME FLOOD

01:01:20.176 --> 01:01:22.011
IRRIGATION BUT WE'RE BEGINNING

01:01:22.078 --> 01:01:23.479
TO MOVE AWAY FROM --

01:01:23.546 --> 01:01:25.314
FLOOD IRRIGATION MORE PRECISION

01:01:25.381 --> 01:01:26.649
WATERING THROUGH MICROSPORUM

01:01:26.716 --> 01:01:28.684
COLORS AND DRIPPED.

01:01:28.751 --> 01:01:30.653
AND AL LOT OF THE CHANGES

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:33.289
INCREASED MORE RECENTLY BECAUSE

01:01:33.356 --> 01:01:34.924
OF STRONG PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE

01:01:34.991 --> 01:01:37.493
STATE AS A NEW AND STRICTER

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:39.095
RULES COME DOWN ON OUR WATER

01:01:39.162 --> 01:01:40.630
DURING THE DROUGHT --

01:01:40.696 --> 01:01:41.164
A PROGRAMS LIKE YOU HEARD

01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:44.367
EARLIER WE PROGRAM WE HAVE BEEN

01:01:44.434 --> 01:01:45.501
A SUCCESSFUL --

01:01:45.568 --> 01:01:48.571
APPLICANT AND REWARDED --

01:01:48.638 --> 01:01:49.906
A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT PROJECTS

01:01:49.972 --> 01:01:51.040
THROUGH THE SWEET PROGRAM AND

01:01:51.107 --> 01:01:52.408
THEY'VE HAD A SIGNIFICANT

01:01:52.475 --> 01:01:54.110
IMPROVEMENT ON OUR FARM --

01:01:54.177 --> 01:01:55.845
BOTH ON ENERGY EFFICIENCY BY

01:01:55.912 --> 01:01:58.481
INSTALLING A HELPING US TO

01:01:58.548 --> 01:02:01.084
INSTALL A SOLAR SYSTEM PLANT TO

01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:03.386
A POWER OUR ELECTRIC PUMPS.

01:02:03.453 --> 01:02:05.521
AND TO CONVERT OUR SOME OF OUR

01:02:05.588 --> 01:02:07.090
FLOOD IRRIGATION FIELDS TO

01:02:07.156 --> 01:02:08.157
MICROSPORUM CLAIRE'S AND DRIP

01:02:08.224 --> 01:02:09.459
SYSTEMS.

01:02:09.525 --> 01:02:11.594
AND WHEN UP FROM THOSE CHANGES

01:02:11.661 --> 01:02:13.062
WE HAVE SEEN --

01:02:13.129 --> 01:02:15.198
SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT.

01:02:15.264 --> 01:02:18.167
PART OF THAT PROGRAM ALSO I CAN

01:02:18.234 --> 01:02:19.836
SEE A LOT OF OUR NEIGHBORS --

01:02:19.902 --> 01:02:21.771
THAT FARM NEAR US HAVE BEEN

01:02:21.838 --> 01:02:23.573
APPLYING FOR AND PARTICIPATING

01:02:23.639 --> 01:02:25.675
IN THAT PROGRAM AND FIELDS THAT

01:02:25.741 --> 01:02:27.243
HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN FLOOD

01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:28.811
IRRIGATED ARE STARTING TO MOVE

01:02:28.878 --> 01:02:30.146
TOWARDS THESE MORE PRECISION

01:02:30.213 --> 01:02:31.180
WATERING.

01:02:31.247 --> 01:02:33.850
AND THAT ALONE RC AS WHERE

01:02:33.916 --> 01:02:35.318
YOU'RE GONNA SEE REAL

01:02:35.384 --> 01:02:37.220
SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT ON FARM

01:02:37.286 --> 01:02:39.388
WATER USE IS A THROUGH THOSE

01:02:39.455 --> 01:02:41.124
PROGRAMS AND PARTNERSHIPS

01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:44.293
BETWEEN FARMERS AND THE STATE AS

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:45.828
WE WORK TOGETHER TO FIND TO

01:02:45.895 --> 01:02:47.330
REACH THOSE GOALS AND THAT THOSE

01:02:47.396 --> 01:02:48.531
PROGRAMS ARE.

01:02:48.598 --> 01:02:49.999
CRITICAL TO THAT.

01:02:50.066 --> 01:02:51.734
ANOTHER PROGRAM NOT RELATED TO

01:02:51.801 --> 01:02:53.669
WATER THAT WE ALSO PARTICIPATE

01:02:53.736 --> 01:02:56.072
AND IN IS VERY POPULAR AND I

01:02:56.139 --> 01:02:59.208
THINK HAS HAD A DRAMATIC EFFECT

01:02:59.275 --> 01:03:00.343
FOR AGRICULTURE.

01:03:00.409 --> 01:03:02.278
IS THE TRACTOR REPLACEMENT

01:03:02.345 --> 01:03:04.380
PROGRAM OPERATED THROUGH THE AIR

01:03:04.447 --> 01:03:06.048
RESOURCES BOARD.

01:03:06.115 --> 01:03:07.817
AND THAT RECEIVES A SIGNIFICANT

01:03:07.884 --> 01:03:09.218
AMOUNT OF FUNDING THROUGH THE I

01:03:09.285 --> 01:03:11.020
BELIEVE IS THE FARMER --

01:03:11.087 --> 01:03:13.022
PROGRAM THAT WAS RECENTLY

01:03:13.089 --> 01:03:13.322
[inaudible]

01:03:13.389 --> 01:03:15.224
BUDGETS.

01:03:15.291 --> 01:03:16.726
THAT PROGRAM WE'VE BEEN

01:03:16.792 --> 01:03:18.060
REPLACING SOME OF OUR OLDER

01:03:18.127 --> 01:03:19.762
TRACTORS TRACTORS THAT WE'VE

01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:21.464
USED ON OUR FARM --

01:03:21.531 --> 01:03:23.366
SINCE BEFORE I WAS BORN --

01:03:23.432 --> 01:03:25.001
BACK FROM SET SOME TRACTORS FROM

01:03:25.067 --> 01:03:26.736
DATING FROM THE SIXTIES AND

01:03:26.802 --> 01:03:28.437
SEVENTIES DIESEL TRACTORS --

01:03:28.504 --> 01:03:30.239
THAT WE AS FARMERS WE LIKE TO

01:03:30.306 --> 01:03:32.275
KEEP EVERYTHING PATCHED TOGETHER

01:03:32.341 --> 01:03:33.809
AND GO AS WHERE WHERE WHERE VERY

01:03:33.876 --> 01:03:35.411
FRUGAL.

01:03:35.478 --> 01:03:37.113
THAT THE AND THEY WERE NOT

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:39.815
REALLY AS LOW POLLUTING THERE

01:03:39.882 --> 01:03:42.084
ARE A LOT OF TEARS ZERO TWO YEAR

01:03:42.151 --> 01:03:43.786
ONE MOSTLY TEARS ZERO TRACTORS

01:03:43.853 --> 01:03:44.720
AND THROUGH THIS TRACTOR

01:03:44.787 --> 01:03:46.355
REPLACEMENT PROGRAM.

01:03:46.422 --> 01:03:49.425
IT HELPS US INCENTIVIZE TO

01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:51.427
UPGRADE OUR QUITMAN AND SO WE'VE

01:03:51.494 --> 01:03:52.828
BEEN ABLE TO REPLACE AND WE

01:03:52.895 --> 01:03:54.263
SHOULD PROBABLY BY THE END OF

01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:55.531
NEXT YEAR HAVE COMPLETELY

01:03:55.598 --> 01:03:56.832
REPLACED OUR ENTIRE TRACTOR

01:03:56.899 --> 01:04:00.002
FLEET. TO TIER THREE OR FOUR

01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:02.572
TRACTORS AND THAT IS JUST ON OUR

01:04:02.638 --> 01:04:04.507
FARM THAT PROGRAM IS SO

01:04:04.574 --> 01:04:05.675
SUCCESSFUL.

01:04:05.741 --> 01:04:09.745
THAT WE HAVE TO WAIT. TO GET THE

01:04:09.812 --> 01:04:13.015
A THE APPROVAL FOR REPLACING

01:04:13.082 --> 01:04:14.617
TRACTORS BECAUSE THERE ARE SO

01:04:14.684 --> 01:04:15.952
MANY APPLICATIONS THERE'S MORE

01:04:16.018 --> 01:04:17.920
APPLICATIONS NOT THE MONEY.

01:04:17.987 --> 01:04:20.056
THEN PEOPLE ABLE TO PROCESS THE

01:04:20.122 --> 01:04:21.591
APPLICATIONS SO WE'D HAVE WAITS

01:04:21.657 --> 01:04:23.826
OF UP TO TWO YEARS JUST BECAUSE

01:04:23.893 --> 01:04:25.494
THERE'S SUCH A HIGH VOLUME OF

01:04:25.561 --> 01:04:26.729
AGRICULTURAL IS SEEKING TO

01:04:26.796 --> 01:04:28.431
CHANGE THEIR TRACTORS.

01:04:28.497 --> 01:04:29.999
AND SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:04:30.066 --> 01:04:32.401
EMISSIONS AND ON ON FARM AND OFF

01:04:32.468 --> 01:04:33.769
FARMAN THROUGHOUT THE CENTRAL

01:04:33.836 --> 01:04:34.670
VALLEY.

01:04:34.737 --> 01:04:36.639
NOW GOING FROM TWO ZERO TO TIER

01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:38.374
THREE OR FOUR THAT YOU HAVE SUCH

01:04:38.441 --> 01:04:40.009
AN INTEREST WITHIN THE INDUSTRY

01:04:40.076 --> 01:04:41.510
TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES.

01:04:41.577 --> 01:04:43.646
I THINK THAT SAYS A LOT ABOUT

01:04:43.713 --> 01:04:45.281
AGRICULTURE AND ITS INVESTMENT

01:04:45.348 --> 01:04:46.549
IN.

01:04:46.616 --> 01:04:49.185
PARTICIPATING IN PARTNERSHIPS TO

01:04:49.252 --> 01:04:50.620
TO CLEAN UP --

01:04:50.686 --> 01:04:52.822
THE AR INTO AND MODERNIZE OUR

01:04:52.888 --> 01:04:54.690
FLEET OF EQUIPMENT --

01:04:54.757 --> 01:04:56.425
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IT WE'RE

01:04:56.492 --> 01:04:58.594
ALL KIND OF BASICALLY IN THIS --

01:04:58.661 --> 01:05:00.363
VALLEY TOGETHER AND THROUGHOUT

01:05:00.429 --> 01:05:01.197
THE STATE TOGETHER WE WORK

01:05:01.264 --> 01:05:03.266
TOGETHER AND NOT PARTNERSHIP

01:05:03.332 --> 01:05:05.067
WITH THE STATE ON HELPING TO

01:05:05.134 --> 01:05:07.036
INCENTIVIZE SHOWS THAT I THINK

01:05:07.103 --> 01:05:09.372
THAT YOU CAN HAVE A LOT OF

01:05:09.438 --> 01:05:11.240
POWERFUL INFLUENCE ON ON THE

01:05:11.307 --> 01:05:13.976
ENVIRONMENT --

01:05:14.043 --> 01:05:15.278
OTHER THAN THAT I THINK THERE'S

01:05:15.344 --> 01:05:17.113
A LOT OF OTHER SMALL ACTIVITIES

01:05:17.179 --> 01:05:19.548
THAT HAPPEN ON THE FARM BUT MY

01:05:19.615 --> 01:05:22.418
MY BIGGEST POINT IS IS I THINK

01:05:22.485 --> 01:05:23.953
FOR LOOKING AT AGRICULTURE AND

01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:26.055
ITS PARTICIPATION AND AND AND

01:05:26.122 --> 01:05:27.723
TRYING -- TO

01:05:27.790 --> 01:05:28.958
TO BE BETTER STEWARDS OF THE

01:05:29.025 --> 01:05:31.227
LAND THAT WE FARM FOR SO LONG --

01:05:31.294 --> 01:05:34.130
AS AS THE WORLD.

01:05:34.196 --> 01:05:35.898
SENATE'S DEFINITELY HELP.

01:05:35.965 --> 01:05:37.600
AGRICULTURE MAKE THE CHANGE TO

01:05:37.667 --> 01:05:39.502
THE MODERN --

01:05:39.568 --> 01:05:41.871
MODERN STANDARDS BECAUSE IF

01:05:41.937 --> 01:05:44.006
YOU'RE A LARGE FARM.

01:05:44.073 --> 01:05:45.975
IT'S EASY --

01:05:46.042 --> 01:05:47.476
TO SPREAD THAT COST OUT OVER A

01:05:47.543 --> 01:05:49.078
LARGE ACRES BUT FOR YOUR MID

01:05:49.145 --> 01:05:52.415
SIZE AND SMALL FARMS LIKE MYSELF --

01:05:52.481 --> 01:05:53.482
THE CHANGES ARE MUCH HARDER TO

01:05:53.549 --> 01:05:55.084
MAKE AND SO THAT'S WHY I THINK

01:05:55.151 --> 01:05:57.186
THESE PROGRAMS CAN HAVE EVEN

01:05:57.253 --> 01:05:57.420
BAKER --

01:05:57.486 --> 01:05:58.287
INCENTIVE TO HELP [inaudible]

01:05:58.354 --> 01:06:00.323
THANK YOU.

01:06:00.389 --> 01:06:01.490
THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE

01:06:01.557 --> 01:06:04.327
YOUR TESTIMONY.

01:06:04.393 --> 01:06:05.695
HI MY NAME IS PAUL BUTLER WITH

01:06:05.761 --> 01:06:07.063
THE CALIFORNIA RICE COMMISSION --

01:06:07.129 --> 01:06:08.931
I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE

01:06:08.998 --> 01:06:10.833
OPPORTUNITY TO COME AND TALK

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:11.767
ABOUT.

01:06:11.834 --> 01:06:13.102
THE RICE INDUSTRIES --

01:06:13.169 --> 01:06:14.737
ENVIRONMENTAL RESUME --

01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:16.739
JUST FOR A LITTLE BACKGROUND --

01:06:16.806 --> 01:06:18.474
I SPENT OVER TEN YEARS WITH

01:06:18.541 --> 01:06:20.076
CALIFORNIA RESOURCES BOARD AND

01:06:20.142 --> 01:06:21.177
I'VE BEEN MANAGING ENVIRONMENTAL

01:06:21.243 --> 01:06:22.978
AFFAIRS NOW TO RAISE COMMISSION

01:06:23.045 --> 01:06:25.781
FOR ALMOST TWENTY YEARS --

01:06:25.848 --> 01:06:27.416
GOING TO THE NEXT SLIDE.

01:06:27.483 --> 01:06:29.552
HERE ARE JUST SOME SYMBOLS

01:06:29.618 --> 01:06:31.020
REALLY OF THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY.

01:06:31.087 --> 01:06:32.788
WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THEM FOR

01:06:32.855 --> 01:06:34.790
FOR DECADES OF COURSE BUT ON THE

01:06:34.857 --> 01:06:39.362
LEFT SIDE I'M AND SCENE OF THE

01:06:39.428 --> 01:06:41.263
MILLIONS OF WATERFOWL THAT COME

01:06:41.330 --> 01:06:41.931
UP FROM THE RICE FIELDS AND THE

01:06:41.997 --> 01:06:44.900
WINTER TIME --

01:06:44.967 --> 01:06:46.569
WATERFOWL IN THE CENTER AND THEN

01:06:46.635 --> 01:06:48.104
UP ABOVE WE HAVE A SHORE BIRD

01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:50.406
THERE LONG BILLED CURLEW.

01:06:50.473 --> 01:06:51.674
IT IS HIGHLY IMPERILED INTO THE

01:06:51.741 --> 01:06:53.175
U. S. SHARPER CONSERVATION

01:06:53.242 --> 01:06:55.344
PLANNING IT THRIVES WELL IN

01:06:55.411 --> 01:06:56.946
CALIFORNIA RICE AND WE DIDN'T

01:06:57.012 --> 01:06:58.280
BEEN DOING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT

01:06:58.347 --> 01:07:00.249
OF WORK WITH OUR WATERBIRD

01:07:00.316 --> 01:07:02.284
PARTNERS TO ENHANCE --

01:07:02.351 --> 01:07:04.019
HABITAT FOR FOR THOSE BIRDS

01:07:04.086 --> 01:07:04.920
ENOUGH IN THE UPPER RIGHT YOU

01:07:04.987 --> 01:07:06.088
SEE THE GIANT GARTER SNAKE WHICH

01:07:06.155 --> 01:07:08.724
IS A THREATENED SPECIES WHICH

01:07:08.791 --> 01:07:10.760
THRIVED A WELL AND HAS ADAPTED

01:07:10.826 --> 01:07:12.161
WELL -- TO

01:07:12.228 --> 01:07:13.662
RICE INDUSTRY IN THE SACRAMENTO

01:07:13.729 --> 01:07:15.097
VALLEY IN FACT THAT IT'S

01:07:15.164 --> 01:07:17.032
POSSIBLE THAT IF RICE WASN'T

01:07:17.099 --> 01:07:18.667
THERE THAT SNAKE MAY NOT BE THE

01:07:18.734 --> 01:07:20.069
AROUND EITHER SO.

01:07:20.136 --> 01:07:21.170
AND THEN OF COURSE YOU SEE THE

01:07:21.237 --> 01:07:24.540
BEAUTIFUL BLUE CLEAR SKIES WHICH

01:07:24.607 --> 01:07:26.108
FORMERLY THEY WANT SO CLEAR WE

01:07:26.175 --> 01:07:27.777
BURNED ALL OF OUR RIGHTS STRONG.

01:07:27.843 --> 01:07:29.879
WHO NO LONGER DOING THAT AND --

01:07:29.945 --> 01:07:31.914
USING ALTERNATIVES TO DECOMPOSE

01:07:31.981 --> 01:07:33.048
R. RICE STRAW.

01:07:33.115 --> 01:07:34.750
AND THEN OF COURSE WE SEE A

01:07:34.817 --> 01:07:36.051
SALMON WHICH I'LL TALK ABOUT IN

01:07:36.118 --> 01:07:37.086
A FEW MOMENTS IT'S SORT OF THE

01:07:37.153 --> 01:07:40.222
NEXT OF FRONTIER FOR US WE HOPE --

01:07:40.289 --> 01:07:42.925
FOR IMPROVING HABITAT.

01:07:42.992 --> 01:07:45.327
US SO THAT 97% OF THE OF THE

01:07:45.394 --> 01:07:47.129
RICE IN IS GROWN RIGHT HERE IN

01:07:47.196 --> 01:07:49.398
THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY ABOUT FIVE

01:07:49.465 --> 01:07:50.132
HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES ABOUT

01:07:50.199 --> 01:07:52.201
FIVE BILLION. TWENTY FIVE

01:07:52.268 --> 01:07:53.803
THOUSAND JOBS TO THE ECONOMY. OH

01:07:53.869 --> 01:07:55.504
WE GROW VIRTUALLY EVERY GRAIN OF

01:07:55.571 --> 01:07:58.207
AMERICA'S SUSHI RICE --

01:07:58.274 --> 01:07:59.642
THE REST OF THE U. S. GROWS A

01:07:59.708 --> 01:08:01.343
PRIMARILY LONG GRAIN AND WE GROW

01:08:01.410 --> 01:08:02.945
ALL OF THE SUSHI RICE.

01:08:03.012 --> 01:08:03.779
A IN THE UNITED STATES AND OF

01:08:03.846 --> 01:08:07.883
COURSE I WE HAVE THE HIGHEST

01:08:07.950 --> 01:08:09.251
YIELDS IN THE WORLD --

01:08:09.318 --> 01:08:10.619
WERE MUCH MORE ATER EFFICIENT

01:08:10.686 --> 01:08:12.488
THAN YOU MIGHT IMAGINE TALK

01:08:12.555 --> 01:08:13.956
ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT AS WELL.

01:08:14.023 --> 01:08:17.893
AND OF COURSE WE HAVE A A VERY --

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:19.829
STRONG THIRTY YEAR HISTORY OF

01:08:19.895 --> 01:08:21.964
MANAGING WATER AND AIR QUALITY

01:08:22.031 --> 01:08:23.499
PROGRAMS --

01:08:23.566 --> 01:08:27.570
HERE IN THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY --

01:08:27.636 --> 01:08:29.138
RICE'S GROWN IN JUST FIVE INCHES

01:08:29.205 --> 01:08:30.439
OF WATER A MANY PEOPLE THINK

01:08:30.506 --> 01:08:32.041
IT'S MUCH DEEPER THAN THAT BUT

01:08:32.107 --> 01:08:34.143
IT IS INDEED JUST FIVE INCHES --

01:08:34.210 --> 01:08:34.877
WE USE --

01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:37.179
GPS TECHNOLOGY TO LASER LEVEL

01:08:37.246 --> 01:08:39.215
THOSE FIELDS US FLAT AS A TABLE

01:08:39.281 --> 01:08:41.217
TOP SO THAT ALLOWS US TO MANAGE

01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:41.951
WATER.

01:08:42.017 --> 01:08:43.619
VERY VERY PRECISELY AND

01:08:43.686 --> 01:08:44.653
EFFICIENTLY.

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:46.288
USING ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT OF

01:08:46.355 --> 01:08:48.023
WATER HAS ORANGES AND BROCCOLI

01:08:48.090 --> 01:08:49.792
ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO EFFICIENCY

01:08:49.859 --> 01:08:51.560
IS A RICE IS GROWN IN VERY HEAVY

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:52.728
CLAY SOILS.

01:08:52.795 --> 01:08:54.697
THAT DO NOT PERCOLATE A WATER

01:08:54.763 --> 01:08:56.432
MUCH AT ALL SO THEY'RE PERFECT

01:08:56.499 --> 01:08:58.534
SORT OF BATHTUBS.

01:08:58.601 --> 01:09:03.539
TO DOUBLE WATER VERY EFFICIENTLY --

01:09:03.606 --> 01:09:04.740
BUT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY SPECIES

01:09:04.807 --> 01:09:07.376
ARE USING THESE RICE FIELDS --

01:09:07.443 --> 01:09:09.211
IF YOU IF THE RICE FIELDS WERE

01:09:09.278 --> 01:09:10.646
NOT THERE A BUT YOU WANTED TO

01:09:10.713 --> 01:09:12.248
PROVIDE.

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:14.316
THE SAME AMOUNT OF HABITAT TO

01:09:14.383 --> 01:09:15.851
SUPPORT THE SAME NUMBER OF

01:09:15.918 --> 01:09:17.820
WINTERING WATERFOWL ABOUT. SIX

01:09:17.887 --> 01:09:19.855
MILLION DOCS YOU WOULD HAVE TO

01:09:19.922 --> 01:09:21.891
ACQUIRE AND RESTORE TWO HUNDRED

01:09:21.957 --> 01:09:24.126
AND FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES OF OF

01:09:24.193 --> 01:09:25.027
WEAPONS.

01:09:25.094 --> 01:09:27.096
THAT WOULD COST YOU ABOUT THREE

01:09:27.162 --> 01:09:27.763
BILLION DOLLARS RIGHT OUT OF THE

01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:29.398
GATE THEN YOU'D HAVE TO MAINTAIN

01:09:29.465 --> 01:09:30.733
THOSE ACRES.

01:09:30.799 --> 01:09:32.501
AT SOME PROBABLY FIFTY MILLION

01:09:32.568 --> 01:09:35.371
DOLLARS A YEAR SO THERE'S JUST

01:09:35.437 --> 01:09:36.405
ONE ONE SLICE OF OUR

01:09:36.472 --> 01:09:37.840
ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT THAT IS

01:09:37.907 --> 01:09:39.642
WINTERING WATERFOWL THAT WE CAN

01:09:39.708 --> 01:09:41.243
QUANTIFY BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL THE

01:09:41.310 --> 01:09:42.778
MODELING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT.

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:44.647
WITH OUR PARTNERS.

01:09:44.713 --> 01:09:46.549
OF ALL OF OUR RACE FIELDS ALONG

01:09:46.615 --> 01:09:48.584
WITH THAT ROUGHLY SEVENTY FIVE

01:09:48.651 --> 01:09:49.318
THOUSAND ACRES OF WETLANDS IN

01:09:49.385 --> 01:09:50.152
THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY ARE

01:09:50.219 --> 01:09:52.688
DESIGNATED AS SHOREBIRD HABITAT.

01:09:52.755 --> 01:09:54.423
OF INTERNATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE

01:09:54.490 --> 01:09:55.624
YOU CAN READ ABOUT THAT IT

01:09:55.691 --> 01:09:57.159
MANAGEMENT DOT ORG --

01:09:57.226 --> 01:10:00.462
AND WE HAVE A VERY VERY STRONG --

01:10:00.529 --> 01:10:02.631
PARTNERSHIPS WITH A ALL THAT.

01:10:02.698 --> 01:10:04.266
A LOT OF HOW CONSERVATION'S.

01:10:04.333 --> 01:10:06.135
CONSERVATION GROUPS HERE --

01:10:06.201 --> 01:10:08.337
AND FACT IN YOUR PACKET THAT

01:10:08.404 --> 01:10:09.204
I'VE LEFT YOU THERE'S THAT

01:10:09.271 --> 01:10:10.372
THERE'S AN INFORMATIONAL

01:10:10.439 --> 01:10:11.874
DOCUMENT THAT SHOWS REALLY ALL

01:10:11.941 --> 01:10:13.576
THOSE PARTNERSHIPS IN THE

01:10:13.642 --> 01:10:14.109
PROGRAMS THAT WE IMPLEMENT

01:10:14.176 --> 01:10:17.079
TOGETHER.

01:10:17.146 --> 01:10:17.780
JUST A REALLY INTERESTING

01:10:17.846 --> 01:10:19.882
GRAPHIC SHOWS YOU ABOUT 60% OF

01:10:19.949 --> 01:10:21.717
EVERYTHING A DUCK EATS COMES OUT

01:10:21.784 --> 01:10:23.819
OF RICE FIELDS ABOUT ABOUT ONE

01:10:23.886 --> 01:10:25.254
THIRD OF WHAT THEY NEED IS

01:10:25.321 --> 01:10:27.189
COMING FROM WETLANDS --

01:10:27.256 --> 01:10:28.991
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH HALF OF

01:10:29.058 --> 01:10:30.859
THAT WETLANDS PIE --

01:10:30.926 --> 01:10:32.561
IS ALSO RELATED TO RIGHTS

01:10:32.628 --> 01:10:33.629
BECAUSE OF COURSE THE RICE

01:10:33.696 --> 01:10:35.864
FIELDS DON'T CONSUME ALL OF THE

01:10:35.931 --> 01:10:37.299
WATER IN THE FIELDS THAT'S

01:10:37.366 --> 01:10:38.500
DRAINED OFF AT THE END OF THE

01:10:38.567 --> 01:10:40.569
SEASON --

01:10:40.636 --> 01:10:42.404
ABOUT SEPTEMBER ONE OR SO.

01:10:42.471 --> 01:10:43.706
AND ALL THAT WATER THAT STRAINED

01:10:43.772 --> 01:10:45.774
OFF IS USED BY OTHER DOWNSTREAM

01:10:45.841 --> 01:10:47.576
USES INCLUDING A HALF OF THE

01:10:47.643 --> 01:10:49.011
WETLANDS FLAT UP WITH OUR TAIL

01:10:49.078 --> 01:10:51.447
WATER -- BUT

01:10:51.513 --> 01:10:52.615
BECAUSE IT'S RIGHT ABOUT THE

01:10:52.681 --> 01:10:54.149
TIME THAT THEY NEED TO FLAT OUT

01:10:54.216 --> 01:10:57.052
FOR TAXIS AND SO --

01:10:57.119 --> 01:10:57.987
THE ENERGETICS AYE.

01:10:58.053 --> 01:11:00.990
IS.

01:11:01.056 --> 01:11:02.691
GOV OUT A DOUBLE THE WATERFOWL

01:11:02.758 --> 01:11:04.293
THEIR IN THE VALLEY IN THE

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:05.060
WINTER.

01:11:05.127 --> 01:11:07.329
ARE ARE VERY VERY RELIANT ON

01:11:07.396 --> 01:11:09.131
RICE ACRES THEY'VE ADAPTED TO

01:11:09.198 --> 01:11:11.567
THEM WHILE. 95% OF THE WETLANDS

01:11:11.634 --> 01:11:13.636
ARE GONE AND SO MORE IN A

01:11:13.702 --> 01:11:15.337
SITUATION WHERE THESE RICE

01:11:15.404 --> 01:11:16.605
FIELDS ARE NOW UP.

01:11:16.672 --> 01:11:18.440
YOU KNOW CARRYING LABORING MORE

01:11:18.507 --> 01:11:19.708
FOR WATERFOWL.

01:11:19.775 --> 01:11:20.976
AND JUST SEE.

01:11:21.043 --> 01:11:22.311
WHAT THAT REALLY MEANS HERE'S A

01:11:22.378 --> 01:11:24.446
COUPLE OF GRAPHICS --

01:11:24.513 --> 01:11:26.815
IF 50% OF THE RICE FIELDS WERE

01:11:26.882 --> 01:11:28.484
TO GO AWAY THEIR AB ONE MILLION

01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:30.219
FEWER DUCKS.

01:11:30.285 --> 01:11:31.520
KNOW WHEN OUR TIME HERE IN THE

01:11:31.587 --> 01:11:32.821
SACRAMENTO VALLEY AND THAT'S

01:11:32.888 --> 01:11:34.823
SUPPORTED BY THESE ENERGETICS

01:11:34.890 --> 01:11:37.059
CURVES YOU SEE AT THE BOTTOM.

01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:39.628
THE BOTTOM YOU CAN SEE THE THE

01:11:39.695 --> 01:11:41.063
RED CURVE IS THE DUCK

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:42.498
POPULATIONS IN THE BLACK CURVE

01:11:42.564 --> 01:11:45.034
IS FOOD WITHOUT RICE --

01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:46.635
AT THE DOCKS EITHER STARVE OR

01:11:46.702 --> 01:11:48.504
HAVE TO LEAVE THE AREA ABOUT

01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:49.805
DECEMBER.

01:11:49.872 --> 01:11:51.974
BUT WITH RICE SEE THAT BUT I'M

01:11:52.041 --> 01:11:53.809
VERY HIGH BLACK CURVE.

01:11:53.876 --> 01:11:54.877
OF THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE GROWERS

01:11:54.943 --> 01:11:57.646
Y. THEY WOULD LOVE --

01:11:57.713 --> 01:11:59.014
EVERY KERNEL OF RICE THEY LEAVE

01:11:59.081 --> 01:12:01.016
ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY

01:12:01.083 --> 01:12:01.583
YEARS THREE HUNDRED POUNDS

01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:02.251
BEHIND.

01:12:02.317 --> 01:12:03.652
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE

01:12:03.719 --> 01:12:05.220
DOCTOR AFTER --

01:12:05.287 --> 01:12:07.289
HIGH CARBOHYDRATES TO PREPARE TO

01:12:07.356 --> 01:12:09.158
GO UP AND HAVE VERY SUCCESSFUL A

01:12:09.224 --> 01:12:13.162
NESTING.

01:12:13.228 --> 01:12:16.465
SO WE HAVE A HAD A LOT OF

01:12:16.532 --> 01:12:16.732
SUCCESS --

01:12:16.799 --> 01:12:20.736
WITH OUR PARTNERS OF ATTRACTING

01:12:20.803 --> 01:12:21.804
INCENTIVE DOLLARS --

01:12:21.870 --> 01:12:23.772
FOR PROGRAMS --

01:12:23.839 --> 01:12:25.741
IN YOUR PACKET IS THAT IS THAT

01:12:25.808 --> 01:12:27.443
IS REALLY A CASE STUDY ABOUT A

01:12:27.509 --> 01:12:29.678
PROGRAM THAT WE BUILT --

01:12:29.745 --> 01:12:31.814
RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA CALLED

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:32.848
AND THEY WATER BIRD HABITAT

01:12:32.915 --> 01:12:34.983
HANSON PROGRAM WE CALL IT

01:12:35.050 --> 01:12:35.284
WEAPONS --

01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:38.887
WE EIGHT BASICALLY INVENTED --

01:12:38.954 --> 01:12:40.889
FOUR FIVE UNIQUE PRACTICES THAT

01:12:40.956 --> 01:12:42.558
WE KNEW THAT WE COULD THAT

01:12:42.624 --> 01:12:43.926
INCREASE THE ECOSYSTEM BENEFIT

01:12:43.992 --> 01:12:45.828
OF EACH ACRE OF RICE WITH THESE

01:12:45.894 --> 01:12:46.762
PRACTICES.

01:12:46.829 --> 01:12:48.564
AND SINCE THEN AND RCS HAS

01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:49.798
CONTRIBUTED ABOUT TWENTY FOUR

01:12:49.865 --> 01:12:52.067
MILLION DOLLARS. TO ENHANCE

01:12:52.134 --> 01:12:54.069
ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY

01:12:54.136 --> 01:12:55.471
FIVE THOUSAND ACRES OF RICE --

01:12:55.537 --> 01:12:57.439
IN THAT TIME FRAME.

01:12:57.506 --> 01:12:59.475
HOWEVER WHERE WE'RE STRUGGLING

01:12:59.541 --> 01:13:00.909
TO HOLD ON TO THOSE PROGRAMS SO

01:13:00.976 --> 01:13:02.678
SO FEDERAL FUNDING IS IS

01:13:02.745 --> 01:13:04.480
DECLINING IN RECENT YEARS --

01:13:04.546 --> 01:13:06.348
WE'VE NOT.

01:13:06.415 --> 01:13:08.150
EVER TO THIS POINT HAD AS A

01:13:08.217 --> 01:13:10.052
STATE PROGRAM REALLY THAT WAS

01:13:10.119 --> 01:13:11.253
DEDICATED FOR THIS TYPE.

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:13.722
RICELAND HABITAT PURPOSES.

01:13:13.789 --> 01:13:14.590
I AM.

01:13:14.656 --> 01:13:17.192
VERY PLEASED TO REPORT THAT AP

01:13:17.259 --> 01:13:19.194
AT TWENTY THREE FORTY EIGHT MS

01:13:19.261 --> 01:13:20.062
CURRIE'S BILL.

01:13:20.129 --> 01:13:22.231
WILL DO EXACTLY THAT AND THERE'S

01:13:22.297 --> 01:13:24.166
A THERE'S A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR

01:13:24.233 --> 01:13:25.634
ONE TIME APPROPRIATION TO GET US

01:13:25.701 --> 01:13:26.935
STARTED ON THAT.

01:13:27.002 --> 01:13:28.871
AT THAT THAT GREAT STARDOM WILL

01:13:28.937 --> 01:13:31.006
BE ABLE TO DO I BELIEVE MANY OF

01:13:31.073 --> 01:13:32.808
THAT GREAT PRACTICES THAT WE'VE

01:13:32.875 --> 01:13:34.877
DEVELOPED A A USING THOSE

01:13:34.943 --> 01:13:36.512
FEDERAL FUNDS AND ONE OF THE

01:13:36.578 --> 01:13:38.213
GREAT THINGS I SEE ABOUT.

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:40.382
PUTTING MORE STATE FUNDS TO TO

01:13:40.449 --> 01:13:41.483
TO A PROGRAM LIKE THIS IS THAT

01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:43.685
ALLOWS US TO ATTRACT MORE

01:13:43.752 --> 01:13:44.286
FEDERAL FUNDING IS EVERY TIME

01:13:44.353 --> 01:13:45.387
YOU WANT.

TO GO APPLY FOR ONE OF THESE

01:13:47.256 --> 01:13:48.857
PROGRAMS YOU NEED A NON FEDERAL

01:13:48.924 --> 01:13:49.658
MATCHING.

01:13:49.725 --> 01:13:54.830
ARE TO BE SUCCESSFUL.

01:13:54.897 --> 01:13:56.899
A ANOTHER WAY THAT WE'RE TRYING

01:13:56.965 --> 01:13:58.600
TO INCREASE OUR INVESTMENT.

01:13:58.667 --> 01:14:00.702
IN THESE PRACTICES IS THE RICE

01:14:00.769 --> 01:14:02.271
INDUSTRY HAS CREATED THE

01:14:02.337 --> 01:14:03.639
CALIFORNIA ICELAND'S WATERBIRD

01:14:03.705 --> 01:14:05.841
FOUNDATION --

01:14:05.908 --> 01:14:08.210
WET WEBSITE IS PROMINENTLY THERE

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:10.179
FOR EVERYONE TO TO SEE --

01:14:10.245 --> 01:14:12.381
IF YOU WANNA INVEST IN --

01:14:12.447 --> 01:14:13.949
HABITAT IN THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY

01:14:14.016 --> 01:14:15.517
WE VERY EFFICIENTLY TAKE THOSE

01:14:15.584 --> 01:14:17.252
DOLLARS.

01:14:17.319 --> 01:14:18.987
WE WORK WITH OUR WATER BIRD

01:14:19.054 --> 01:14:20.889
PARTNERS AND A OUR GROWERS AND

01:14:20.956 --> 01:14:25.160
WE INCENTIVIZE THE GROWERS TO DO

01:14:25.227 --> 01:14:26.528
THE ACTIONS THAT WE WANT THEM TO

01:14:26.595 --> 01:14:28.096
DO IT EXACTLY THE TIME OF YEAR

01:14:28.163 --> 01:14:29.565
WE WANT THEM TO DO TO PROVIDE

01:14:29.631 --> 01:14:30.899
VERY SPECIFIC AND TARGETED

01:14:30.966 --> 01:14:32.501
HABITAT.

01:14:32.568 --> 01:14:35.370
AT A VERY COST EFFECTIVE RATE SO.

01:14:35.437 --> 01:14:36.638
ANYONE THAT TO ONCE A TAX

01:14:36.705 --> 01:14:38.874
DEDUCTIBLE DEDUCTION AND ALSO

01:14:38.941 --> 01:14:40.342
OUR OWN AN ACRE HABITAT THE

01:14:40.409 --> 01:14:42.244
SACRAMENTO VALLEY THAT'S A GREAT

01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:44.947
VEHICLE TO DO SO.

01:14:45.013 --> 01:14:46.315
SUBMIT YOUR ON THAT CAN YOU TO

01:14:46.381 --> 01:14:48.150
GIVE US AN IDEA OF WHAT THOSE

01:14:48.217 --> 01:14:49.885
PRACTICES ARMY LIKE WHAT WHAT DO

01:14:49.952 --> 01:14:52.454
YOU DO OKAY AND ARE JUST TO GIVE

01:14:52.521 --> 01:14:53.689
US AN IDEA OF OKAY MIGHT TAKE A

01:14:53.755 --> 01:14:55.290
COUPLE MINUTES BUT OF ONE OF THE

01:14:55.357 --> 01:14:57.993
PRACTICES WE DO FOR EXAMPLE IS.

01:14:58.060 --> 01:14:59.528
A GROWER IS MOST EFFICIENT AGRA

01:14:59.595 --> 01:15:00.829
NAM AKELEY.

01:15:00.896 --> 01:15:02.598
IF AT THE END OF THE WINTER

01:15:02.664 --> 01:15:03.832
SEASON WHEN THAT MAYBE THEY'LL

01:15:03.899 --> 01:15:05.133
GET THE FIELDS FLOODED THEY

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:07.636
TRAIN THEM OFF LIKE A FEBRUARY

01:15:07.703 --> 01:15:08.937
ONE ALL AT THE SAME TIME SO IT

01:15:09.004 --> 01:15:10.639
CAN DRY OUT THOSE FIELDS BECAUSE

01:15:10.706 --> 01:15:12.441
THEY CAN'T REALLY GET PLANTED.

01:15:12.507 --> 01:15:13.575
MUSCLES FIELDS OF DRY.

01:15:13.642 --> 01:15:15.277
WE ARE PRACTICE IT ENCOURAGES

01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:16.378
THEM TO KEEP THAT WATER OUT

01:15:16.445 --> 01:15:19.381
THERE LIKE TILL MID MARCH --

01:15:19.448 --> 01:15:21.450
AND DRAIN THOSE FIELDS --

01:15:21.516 --> 01:15:24.786
BY 25% A WEEK SO NOW THERE'S A

01:15:24.853 --> 01:15:26.054
VARIETY OF SHOREBIRDS THAT COME

01:15:26.121 --> 01:15:27.456
IN AND THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT

01:15:27.522 --> 01:15:28.924
NEEDS IN TERMS OF DEPTH OF WATER

01:15:28.991 --> 01:15:29.725
SO.

01:15:29.791 --> 01:15:31.326
I LIKE TO SAY A BIRD CAN COME ON

01:15:31.393 --> 01:15:32.895
TO ONE FIREMAN FIND HOT BROW OF

01:15:32.961 --> 01:15:34.930
DIFFERENT TO A DEPTH OF WATER.

01:15:34.997 --> 01:15:36.732
TO UTILIZE WILL ALSO HAVE A

01:15:36.798 --> 01:15:38.433
PRACTICE TO BRING WATER ON

01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:40.002
EARLIER --

01:15:40.068 --> 01:15:42.971
IN THE FALL AFTER HARVEST PEOPLE

01:15:43.038 --> 01:15:43.772
DON'T KNOW THIS BUT THE SHORE

01:15:43.839 --> 01:15:45.374
BIRD MIGRATION HAS ALREADY

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:47.142
STARTED LIKE IN JULY LIKE IT'S

01:15:47.209 --> 01:15:48.844
WRAPPING UP NOW IN THESE BIRDS

01:15:48.911 --> 01:15:49.778
COMMAND.

01:15:49.845 --> 01:15:51.079
THEY HAVE A HARD TIME FINDING

01:15:51.146 --> 01:15:52.948
THAT OPEN SHALLOW WATER THAT

01:15:53.015 --> 01:15:55.884
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR AND SO --

01:15:55.951 --> 01:15:56.852
AGAIN IT'S MOST.

01:15:56.919 --> 01:15:58.921
THAT ECONOMICALLY EFFICIENT FOR

01:15:58.987 --> 01:16:00.789
AGO OUR DEBT --

01:16:00.856 --> 01:16:02.291
HAVE HIS WHOLE TEAM WORK ON

01:16:02.357 --> 01:16:03.358
NOTHING BUT HARVEST FOR LIKE

01:16:03.425 --> 01:16:04.960
FIVE WEEKS.

01:16:05.027 --> 01:16:06.428
BUT IF THEY CAN SOMEHOW START

01:16:06.495 --> 01:16:08.697
WORKING ON GETTING WATER ON THE

01:16:08.764 --> 01:16:10.198
FIRST HALF OF THEIR FIELD WHILE

01:16:10.265 --> 01:16:11.500
THEY'RE STILL HARVESTING THE

01:16:11.566 --> 01:16:12.801
LAST PART WE CAN GET SOME WATER

01:16:12.868 --> 01:16:16.171
ON A EARLY AND IT'S VERY

01:16:16.238 --> 01:16:17.706
VALUABLE FOR THE SHORE BIRDS.

01:16:17.773 --> 01:16:19.274
IT'S ALSO NESTING ISLANDS IN A

01:16:19.341 --> 01:16:20.542
VARIETY OF OTHER PRACTICES THAT

01:16:20.609 --> 01:16:21.076
I COULD DO IT [inaudible]

01:16:21.143 --> 01:16:24.179
I'M.

01:16:24.246 --> 01:16:26.114
SO THIS IS WHAT WE HOPE TO BE

01:16:26.181 --> 01:16:27.582
THE NEW FRONTIER --

01:16:27.649 --> 01:16:28.951
FOR US A WHEN YOU WHEN YOU

01:16:29.017 --> 01:16:30.252
REALLY THINK ABOUT THE CONCEPTS

01:16:30.319 --> 01:16:32.120
WE'VE DONE FOR BIRDS WE'VE WE'VE

01:16:32.187 --> 01:16:34.423
ESSENTIALLY REKLAME TO THE THE

01:16:34.489 --> 01:16:36.825
THE FLOOD PLAIN FOR BIRDS JUST

01:16:36.892 --> 01:16:38.527
AS THEY USED HISTORICALLY.

01:16:38.593 --> 01:16:40.963
EXCEPT NOW WE FLY THEM IN RICE

01:16:41.029 --> 01:16:42.597
FIELDS UNDER VERY CONTROLLED

01:16:42.664 --> 01:16:44.299
SITUATIONS AND THE BIRDS ARE

01:16:44.366 --> 01:16:46.001
USING ESSENTIALLY THE SAME LANDS

01:16:46.068 --> 01:16:47.602
THEY DID HISTORICALLY.

01:16:47.669 --> 01:16:50.038
WELL YOU KNOW WE MAY BE ABLE TO

01:16:50.105 --> 01:16:51.306
DO THIS WITH FISH.

01:16:51.373 --> 01:16:52.374
TOO OUR BECAUSE THE REASON WE

01:16:52.441 --> 01:16:54.643
HAVE A SALMON RUNS IN CALIFORNIA

01:16:54.710 --> 01:16:56.378
IS LARGELY BECAUSE THOSE SMALL

01:16:56.445 --> 01:16:59.281
SALMON FRY ORIGINALLY GREW UP IN

01:16:59.348 --> 01:17:00.349
THE FLOOD PLAINS OF THE

01:17:00.415 --> 01:17:01.817
SACRAMENTO VALLEY.

01:17:01.883 --> 01:17:03.352
WHERE THERE WAS VERY LITTLE FLOW

01:17:03.418 --> 01:17:05.287
VERY FEW PREDATORS ALLOTTED

01:17:05.354 --> 01:17:07.589
COVER AND THOSE THE FACT THAT

01:17:07.656 --> 01:17:08.724
THAT WATER JUST SITS THAT

01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:10.559
RECEIVES ALL THAT SOLAR ENERGY

01:17:10.625 --> 01:17:11.660
AND THE PHYTOPLANKTON SO

01:17:11.727 --> 01:17:12.961
PLANKTON CYCLE?

01:17:13.028 --> 01:17:15.564
IT FEEDS THE THOSE THOSE FISH.

01:17:15.630 --> 01:17:16.231
AND THEY GROW VERY.

01:17:16.298 --> 01:17:19.334
AGGRESSIVELY HISTORICALLY THEY

01:17:19.401 --> 01:17:20.502
WERE PUSHED BACK INTO THE MAIN

01:17:20.569 --> 01:17:22.170
CHANNEL THE RIVER AFTER THEY

01:17:22.237 --> 01:17:23.872
WERE LARGE ENOUGH.

01:17:23.939 --> 01:17:25.107
TO AND YOU KNOW BE ABLE TO DEAL

01:17:25.173 --> 01:17:26.708
WITH THOSE FLOWS AND EVADE

01:17:26.775 --> 01:17:27.542
PREDATORS AND THINGS OF THAT

01:17:27.609 --> 01:17:28.276
NATURE.

01:17:28.343 --> 01:17:30.112
NOW WE'VE ESSENTIALLY SEALED OFF

01:17:30.178 --> 01:17:31.546
THE RIVER FROM THE FLOOD PLAIN

01:17:31.613 --> 01:17:33.315
AND THE SMALL FISH HAVE TO SORT

01:17:33.382 --> 01:17:34.850
OF FIGHT FOR THEIR LIVES RIGHT

01:17:34.916 --> 01:17:36.585
IN THE MAIN CHANNEL THE RIVER.

01:17:36.651 --> 01:17:38.620
SO NOW WE ARE LOOKING AT SEEING

01:17:38.687 --> 01:17:39.488
IF WE CAN --

01:17:39.554 --> 01:17:41.023
UTILIZE WINTER FLOODED RICE

01:17:41.089 --> 01:17:43.158
FIELDS EXACTLY THAT WAY ACTUALLY

01:17:43.225 --> 01:17:44.493
PUT THE SALMON IN THE RICE

01:17:44.559 --> 01:17:45.694
FIELDS.

01:17:45.761 --> 01:17:47.496
AND HAVE THEM GROW A VERY VERY

01:17:47.562 --> 01:17:49.297
QUICKLY THERE'S A PROJECT WE'VE

01:17:49.364 --> 01:17:51.066
DONE -- FOR

01:17:51.133 --> 01:17:53.435
THAT HAS BEEN DONE FARE FOR OVER

01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:54.202
FIVE YEARS CALLED AN EERIE

01:17:54.269 --> 01:17:56.304
PROJECT WHERE WE'VE DEMONSTRATED

01:17:56.371 --> 01:17:57.606
THAT THE GROWTH RATES.

01:17:57.672 --> 01:18:00.842
ARE EVER EXTREMELY HIGH I IN

01:18:00.909 --> 01:18:02.377
RICE FIELDS IN THE WINTER TIME

01:18:02.444 --> 01:18:03.245
SO WE'RE GONNA TRY TO REPLICATE

01:18:03.311 --> 01:18:04.479
THAT.

01:18:04.546 --> 01:18:06.548
WE ALSO MAY BE ABLE --

01:18:06.615 --> 01:18:08.583
TO DOT EXPORT HIGHLY NUTRITIOUS

01:18:08.650 --> 01:18:10.018
WATER BACK INTO THE RIVER FROM

01:18:10.085 --> 01:18:11.019
THE RICE FIELDS WHICH I'LL TALK

01:18:11.086 --> 01:18:13.955
ABOUT IN A MINUTE.

01:18:14.022 --> 01:18:15.857
HERE YOU SEE OUT SOME PICTURES

01:18:15.924 --> 01:18:17.959
OF WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT SO ON

01:18:18.026 --> 01:18:18.994
THE UPPER RIGHT ARE THE LITTLE

01:18:19.061 --> 01:18:21.063
MICROSCOPIC CRITTERS THAT THESE

01:18:21.129 --> 01:18:22.864
YOUNG SALMON NEED.

01:18:22.931 --> 01:18:24.266
AND THEY'RE VERY PLENTIFUL IN

01:18:24.332 --> 01:18:25.600
RICE FIELDS WINTER FLOODED RICE

01:18:25.667 --> 01:18:27.202
FIELD OF THE LOWER CORNER SHOWS

01:18:27.269 --> 01:18:27.969
YOU.

01:18:28.036 --> 01:18:29.938
A MANY MANY OF THOSE YOU KNOW

01:18:30.005 --> 01:18:32.340
PER DROP IN IN WINTER FLOODED

01:18:32.407 --> 01:18:33.442
RICE WATER.

01:18:33.508 --> 01:18:35.010
AND SO IF WE CAN.

01:18:35.077 --> 01:18:37.112
GET THE FISH TO THAT AND THEN

01:18:37.179 --> 01:18:38.713
HAVE THEM FIND THEIR WAY BACK TO

01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:40.549
THE RIVER THAT'S ONE CONCEPT OR

01:18:40.615 --> 01:18:41.750
WEAKENED.

01:18:41.817 --> 01:18:43.618
MORE --

01:18:43.685 --> 01:18:45.821
PURPOSEFULLY EXPORT THAT WATER

01:18:45.887 --> 01:18:46.855
INTO THE RIVER AND FEED THEM IN

01:18:46.922 --> 01:18:48.356
THE RIVER.

01:18:48.423 --> 01:18:49.825
SO THERE'S TWO APPROACHES THAT

01:18:49.891 --> 01:18:51.193
WE'RE LOOKING AT MAKING SOME

01:18:51.259 --> 01:18:55.163
PROGRESS ON WE ARE.

01:18:55.230 --> 01:18:57.165
RIGHT NOW IN THE MIDST OF TRYING

01:18:57.232 --> 01:18:58.900
TO DEVELOP A PROJECT I DON'T

01:18:58.967 --> 01:19:00.602
HAVE IT YET BUT I DO HAVE

01:19:00.669 --> 01:19:03.038
COMMITMENT FROM AN RC*. FOR

01:19:03.105 --> 01:19:04.306
ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:19:04.372 --> 01:19:05.006
DOLLARS IF WE CAN PUT THE

01:19:05.073 --> 01:19:06.608
PROJECT TOGETHER.

01:19:06.675 --> 01:19:09.277
OUT WE WOULD ACTUALLY OUTPUT OF

01:19:09.344 --> 01:19:10.712
THE FISH IN THE RICE FIELD AND

01:19:10.779 --> 01:19:12.447
PUT LITTLE RADIO TAGS IN THEM

01:19:12.514 --> 01:19:13.248
AND TRACK THEM ALL THE WAY OUT

01:19:13.315 --> 01:19:14.583
THE GOLDEN GATE.

01:19:14.649 --> 01:19:16.184
WE WOULD DO THE SAME THING FOR

01:19:16.251 --> 01:19:17.185
THE FISH THAT HAVE TO STAY IN

01:19:17.252 --> 01:19:18.520
THE RIVER.

01:19:18.587 --> 01:19:19.588
AND WE BE ABLE TO MAKE IT

01:19:19.654 --> 01:19:21.590
DEMONSTRATION IF THE RICE FIELDS

01:19:21.656 --> 01:19:23.725
REARED FISH ACTUALLY SURVIVE AT

01:19:23.792 --> 01:19:24.893
HIGHER PERCENTAGE.

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:26.428
A OUT THE GOLDEN GATE VERY

01:19:26.495 --> 01:19:28.330
EXCITING SCIENCE.

01:19:28.396 --> 01:19:31.066
WILL ALSO BE PUTTING A FEW

01:19:31.133 --> 01:19:32.667
THOUSAND FISH AND IN THE FIELDS

01:19:32.734 --> 01:19:34.736
PER ACRE AND HAVING THE GROWER

01:19:34.803 --> 01:19:35.871
MANAGED TO HABITAT TO OUR

01:19:35.937 --> 01:19:37.806
SPECIFICATIONS. TO SEE IF WE CAN

01:19:37.873 --> 01:19:39.407
DEVELOP A LONG TERM PRACTICE

01:19:39.474 --> 01:19:41.510
STANDARD. FOR THIS ACTIVITY THAT

01:19:41.576 --> 01:19:43.912
COULD BE FUNDED. FOR A FROM A

01:19:43.979 --> 01:19:46.848
PROGRAM LIKE EQUIPED NRCS WE

01:19:46.915 --> 01:19:49.151
HAVE ROW REYES SEVEN HUNDRED AND

01:19:49.217 --> 01:19:50.051
FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN

01:19:50.118 --> 01:19:51.586
MATCHING DONOR FUNDS SO FAR.

01:19:51.653 --> 01:19:52.888
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO MATCH AT

01:19:52.954 --> 01:19:54.256
LEAST.

01:19:54.322 --> 01:19:55.257
ONE TO ONE OF THE SIX HUNDRED

01:19:55.323 --> 01:19:57.392
THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM AN RCA

01:19:57.459 --> 01:19:58.493
BECHTEL END UP BEING PROBABLY

01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:00.128
ABOUT A ONE POINT FIVE MILLION

01:20:00.195 --> 01:20:01.396
DOLLAR PROJECT SO THERE'S ROOM

01:20:01.463 --> 01:20:02.998
ON THE BANDWAGON FOR ANYBODY

01:20:03.064 --> 01:20:04.232
THAT WANTS.

01:20:04.299 --> 01:20:05.634
TO A JOINT IN.

01:20:05.700 --> 01:20:08.103
AND WERE CURRENTLY LIP SORT OF

01:20:08.170 --> 01:20:09.638
THE LAST PIECE WE'VE GOT ITS

01:20:09.704 --> 01:20:11.039
DURING TALKS WITH.

01:20:11.106 --> 01:20:11.773
A DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:13.241
WILDLIFE AND ABOUT THEIR

01:20:13.308 --> 01:20:14.843
CRITICAL ROLE OF PROVIDING US

01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:17.746
THESE FISH FROM THE HATCHERY --

01:20:17.812 --> 01:20:19.915
SO AS SOON AS WE GET DOWN --

01:20:19.981 --> 01:20:22.317
SOME UNDERSTANDING AS TO WHEN

01:20:22.384 --> 01:20:23.952
AND HOW THEY CAN PARTICIPATE AT

01:20:24.019 --> 01:20:25.520
THAT LEVEL ALLUVIAL TO MOVE

01:20:25.587 --> 01:20:26.454
FORWARD WITH THIS EXCITING

01:20:26.521 --> 01:20:28.723
PROJECT.

01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:30.125
THAT'S IT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER

01:20:30.192 --> 01:20:31.593
ANY QUESTIONS AND WE MAY HAVE.

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:33.595
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:20:33.662 --> 01:20:35.030
SHE DID WELL WILL FINISH THE

01:20:35.096 --> 01:20:35.931
PANEL AND THEN WE'LL COME BACK

01:20:35.997 --> 01:20:37.532
AND SEE WE HAVE SOME QUESTIONS

01:20:37.599 --> 01:20:39.701
BUT I THAT SALMON PROJECT IS

01:20:39.768 --> 01:20:41.136
VERY EXCITING.

01:20:41.203 --> 01:20:42.804
BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT.

01:20:42.871 --> 01:20:44.172
THE COLLAPSE BECAUSE OF CLIMATE

01:20:44.239 --> 01:20:45.607
CHANGE IN DROUGHT WE SEE THE

01:20:45.674 --> 01:20:48.543
COLLAPSE OF CERTAIN.

01:20:48.610 --> 01:20:51.146
SALMON RUNS AND SO THE ABILITY

01:20:51.213 --> 01:20:52.380
TO BRING IT BACK AND TO SET UP A

01:20:52.447 --> 01:20:54.182
NEW MODEL IS VERY EXCITING.

01:20:54.249 --> 01:20:56.551
THANK YOU.

01:20:56.618 --> 01:20:58.486
THANK YOU MISTER MISTER LANCE.

01:20:58.553 --> 01:20:59.754
THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME

01:20:59.821 --> 01:21:01.489
IS MICHAEL LINES ON THE DIRECTOR

01:21:01.556 --> 01:21:02.591
OF PUBLIC POLICY FOR A LOT OF ON

01:21:02.657 --> 01:21:04.025
CALIFORNIA.

01:21:04.092 --> 01:21:05.794
WHICH IS THE STATE BRANCH FOR

01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:07.262
THE NATIONAL AUDUBON SOCIETY.

01:21:07.329 --> 01:21:08.396
AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE

01:21:08.463 --> 01:21:10.565
CHANCE TO COME SPEAK TODAY AND

01:21:10.632 --> 01:21:12.133
TALK A LITTLE ABOUT THE BENEFITS

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:13.969
THAT WE SEE FROM AGRICULTURE.

01:21:14.035 --> 01:21:14.903
PARTICULARLY TO BIRDS BUT TO

01:21:14.970 --> 01:21:17.072
OBTAIN VOMIT LARGE GIVEN I THINK

01:21:17.138 --> 01:21:18.506
THE REALLY PRODUCTIVE AND

01:21:18.573 --> 01:21:20.342
POSITIVE COMMENTS ABOUT A VAN

01:21:20.408 --> 01:21:21.876
PROVIDED BY CAL CAN AND OTHERS

01:21:21.943 --> 01:21:23.645
PAUL CERTAINLY.

01:21:23.712 --> 01:21:24.879
THE OTHER PRETTY BURKE PICTURES

01:21:24.946 --> 01:21:26.414
I SHOULD STONE SOME OF THOSE

01:21:26.481 --> 01:21:28.550
MAKE IT WILL COME UP FOR US.

01:21:28.617 --> 01:21:29.451
PAT.

01:21:29.517 --> 01:21:31.419
I I DON'T REPEAT THOSE BUT I DO

01:21:31.486 --> 01:21:33.455
WANT TO SERVE --

01:21:33.521 --> 01:21:35.156
EMPHASIZE OUR SUPPORT FOR THAT

01:21:35.223 --> 01:21:36.725
FOR THE NOTIONS OF A COW CAM IS

01:21:36.791 --> 01:21:37.993
TALKING ABOUT ABOUT CLIMB AS

01:21:38.059 --> 01:21:39.995
MUCH STRATEGIES ON FARMS HEALTH

01:21:40.061 --> 01:21:41.730
FARMS ALREADY ARE BETTER.

01:21:41.796 --> 01:21:43.798
AT HAD --

01:21:43.865 --> 01:21:45.166
RETAINING --

01:21:45.233 --> 01:21:46.935
CARBON AND OTHER GHG BENEFITS

01:21:47.002 --> 01:21:48.570
NOT ALSO I NON JONASSAINT BY

01:21:48.637 --> 01:21:49.938
MODERNIZING SOME OF MACHINERY

01:21:50.005 --> 01:21:51.740
THAT'S OUT THERE THAT'S I MEAN

01:21:51.806 --> 01:21:53.008
AUDUBON'S CONTINUE TO SUPPORT.

01:21:53.074 --> 01:21:54.276
AND I THINK WHAT IT COMES DOWN

01:21:54.342 --> 01:21:55.443
TO A COUPLE POINTS THAT HEARD

01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:57.145
ALREADY AND THESE ARE THINGS I'M

01:21:57.212 --> 01:21:59.414
GONNA TOUCH ON WHICH OUR THEY

01:21:59.481 --> 01:22:01.149
NEED ONE TO MIMIC WHAT WE CAN

01:22:01.216 --> 01:22:02.784
NATURAL PROCESSES AND THAT'S

01:22:02.851 --> 01:22:03.151
BOTH.

01:22:03.218 --> 01:22:06.087
A WETLAND AREAS AND AS WELL AS

01:22:06.154 --> 01:22:07.622
FOR ABOUT THE FISH I THINK IT'S

01:22:07.689 --> 01:22:09.224
AN EXCITING NEW OPPORTUNITIES.

01:22:09.291 --> 01:22:10.458
THEY'RE OUT THERE THAT WE NEED

01:22:10.525 --> 01:22:11.559
TO PURSUE AND WE NEED TO INVEST

01:22:11.626 --> 01:22:12.994
IN.

01:22:13.061 --> 01:22:14.729
AND AND ALONG THE LINES OF

01:22:14.796 --> 01:22:16.498
INVESTING IS THIS NEED FOR

01:22:16.564 --> 01:22:17.666
ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO

01:22:17.732 --> 01:22:19.134
INCENTIVIZE LAND OWNERS AND

01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:20.201
FARMERS TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE

01:22:20.268 --> 01:22:21.803
PROGRAMS.

01:22:21.870 --> 01:22:24.205
A LOT OF THESE YOU KNOW A LOT OF

01:22:24.272 --> 01:22:25.073
THE PROGRAMS IS JOHN IS

01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:25.940
INDICATING YOU KNOW THEY'RE

01:22:26.007 --> 01:22:27.042
ALREADY WORKING ON A MARGINAL

01:22:27.108 --> 01:22:28.543
SCALE ABOUT HOW FARMS HOW

01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:29.811
PROFITABLE FARMS CAN BE IN THE

01:22:29.878 --> 01:22:31.046
MARKET DRIVEN.

01:22:31.112 --> 01:22:33.148
AND SO IF WE AS A COMMUNITY AS A

01:22:33.214 --> 01:22:34.683
STATE ONE INVEST IN THEM AND AND

01:22:34.749 --> 01:22:36.284
HELP DEVELOP NEW PROGRAMS THAT

01:22:36.351 --> 01:22:37.419
WE NEED TO PROVIDE FUNDING

01:22:37.485 --> 01:22:39.621
SOURCES THAT'LL HELP DURHAM.

01:22:39.688 --> 01:22:41.556
LINED US UP AND THEN THE LAST

01:22:41.623 --> 01:22:42.390
PIECE REALLY IS TRYING TO

01:22:42.457 --> 01:22:44.759
PROVIDE FOR INFORMATION SHARING

01:22:44.826 --> 01:22:45.327
AND EDUCATION WHETHER THAT'S

01:22:45.393 --> 01:22:46.194
CONNECTING --

01:22:46.261 --> 01:22:48.063
REGULATORS AND AGENCIES AND

01:22:48.129 --> 01:22:49.564
POSITIVELY IF OF LANDOWNERS OR

01:22:49.631 --> 01:22:51.433
NGOS PROVIDING A CONDUIT BETWEEN

01:22:51.499 --> 01:22:52.701
DIFFERENT LANDOWNERS WHO CAN

01:22:52.767 --> 01:22:55.403
SHARE PRACTICES INFORMATION.

01:22:55.470 --> 01:22:56.638
SO TO START IN THIS IS A LITTLE

01:22:56.705 --> 01:22:58.273
BIT OF A REPEAT FROM WHAT --

01:22:58.340 --> 01:22:59.974
PAUL WAS TALKING ABOUT WHY WOULD

01:23:00.041 --> 01:23:01.443
A CONSERVATION ORGANIZATION LIKE

01:23:01.509 --> 01:23:04.346
AUDUBON BE ENGAGED IN WORKING

01:23:04.412 --> 01:23:04.879
LANDS PROGRAM WE WOULD ACT

01:23:04.946 --> 01:23:05.280
WORKING.

01:23:05.347 --> 01:23:07.749
AND ACROSS THE NATION.

01:23:07.816 --> 01:23:09.250
WELL IN CALIFORNIA ALONE --

01:23:09.317 --> 01:23:10.318
THERE'S AT LEAST SEVEN MILLION

01:23:10.385 --> 01:23:12.587
ACRES OF IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE.

01:23:12.654 --> 01:23:14.122
AND BUT THERE'S ONLY AN

01:23:14.189 --> 01:23:15.857
ESTIMATED TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:23:15.924 --> 01:23:17.659
PART MANAGED WETLANDS LEFT.

01:23:17.726 --> 01:23:19.561
SO NATURALLY PRIOR TO NINETEEN

01:23:19.627 --> 01:23:20.228
HUNDRED THERE WERE PROBABLY FOUR

01:23:20.295 --> 01:23:22.297
MILLION ACRES OR SO OF NATURAL

01:23:22.364 --> 01:23:23.131
FLOOD PLAIN WETLANDS IN THE

01:23:23.198 --> 01:23:25.400
STATE THEIR IMMENSELY DIVERSE.

01:23:25.467 --> 01:23:27.235
EARLIER EXPLORERS RECORDED THAT

01:23:27.302 --> 01:23:28.136
THEY WOULD WITH A HELP WITH

01:23:28.203 --> 01:23:29.938
THEIR WILD FIRES WERE ACTUALLY

01:23:30.004 --> 01:23:31.373
BIRDS JUST COMING OFF THE

01:23:31.439 --> 01:23:33.041
WETLANDS IN SUCH NUMBERS THAT

01:23:33.108 --> 01:23:34.409
THEY BLOTTED OUT THE SUN.

01:23:34.476 --> 01:23:36.177
AND SO WE CERTAINLY HAVE MANY

01:23:36.244 --> 01:23:37.645
FEWER OF A WETLAND ACRES LEFT

01:23:37.712 --> 01:23:39.681
TODAY AND LIKEWISE ARE BIRD

01:23:39.748 --> 01:23:41.082
POPULATIONS HAVE DECLINED

01:23:41.149 --> 01:23:42.717
SIGNIFICANTLY AS WELL.

01:23:42.784 --> 01:23:45.153
PAUL MENTIONED THAT TIME --

01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:47.522
WE HAVE --

01:23:47.589 --> 01:23:48.089
FIVE TO SEVEN MILLION ACRES

01:23:48.156 --> 01:23:49.724
VIBES FIVE SEVEN MILLION

01:23:49.791 --> 01:23:51.226
WATERFOWL THAT USE THE STATE

01:23:51.292 --> 01:23:52.293
EVERY YEAR THAT'S A NUMBER

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:53.828
THAT'S PROBABLY DOWN FROM THIRTY

01:23:53.895 --> 01:23:55.363
TO FORTY MILLION.

01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:57.766
HISTORICALLY LIKEWISE THE THREE

01:23:57.832 --> 01:23:58.666
HUNDRED FIFTY SHOREBIRD THREE

01:23:58.733 --> 01:24:00.468
AND FIFTY THOUSAND SHOREBIRDS --

01:24:00.535 --> 01:24:02.103
PROBABLY WAS WELL OVER THREE

01:24:02.170 --> 01:24:03.872
MILLION AT ONE TIME HISTORICALLY

01:24:03.938 --> 01:24:05.473
SO FROM A CONSERVATION.

01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:07.008
ORGANIZATION WE UNDERSTAND THE

01:24:07.075 --> 01:24:08.410
BIRDS ARE DECLINE GRASSLAND

01:24:08.476 --> 01:24:10.011
BURNED AS WELL AS WELL TOUCH ON

01:24:10.078 --> 01:24:11.079
THAT WITH RANCHING.

01:24:11.146 --> 01:24:12.947
A AND THAT IN ORDER TO HAVE LONG

01:24:13.014 --> 01:24:13.915
TERM SUSTAINABILITY AND

01:24:13.982 --> 01:24:15.683
CONSERVATION OF THE SPECIES NOT

01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:17.252
JUST BIRDS BUT ALL THE OTHER

01:24:17.318 --> 01:24:18.353
SPECIES AS WELL.

01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:19.654
THEN THAT REQUIRES COLLABORATION

01:24:19.721 --> 01:24:21.656
AND PARTNERSHIP WITH FARMERS AND

01:24:21.723 --> 01:24:23.224
LANDOWNERS AND OTHERS THAT ARE

01:24:23.291 --> 01:24:24.893
STEWARDING LARGETRACTS OF LAND

01:24:24.959 --> 01:24:27.295
IN THE STATE.

01:24:27.362 --> 01:24:28.463
ARE THE LAST THING I'LL ARE JUST

01:24:28.530 --> 01:24:29.864
WILL NOTICE THAT WE'VE ALSO IN

01:24:29.931 --> 01:24:30.799
RECENT YEARS BECOME MORE MORE

01:24:30.865 --> 01:24:34.235
AWARE OF THE NECESSITY.

01:24:34.302 --> 01:24:35.937
FOR NATURAL WORKING LANDS AS

01:24:36.004 --> 01:24:37.205
PART OF OUR CLIMATE CHANGE

01:24:37.272 --> 01:24:39.174
STRATEGY NOT JUST IN

01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:40.975
SEQUESTERING CARBON BUT ALSO

01:24:41.042 --> 01:24:42.944
PROVIDING WILDLIFE CORRIDORS AND

01:24:43.011 --> 01:24:44.412
SOME DEGREE OF RESILIENCE FOR

01:24:44.479 --> 01:24:45.180
NATIVE PLANTS AND NATIVE

01:24:45.246 --> 01:24:46.047
WILDLIFE.

01:24:46.114 --> 01:24:47.782
AS THE LANDSCAPE OVERALL CHANGES

01:24:47.849 --> 01:24:49.317
AND I THINK THAT WILDLIFE

01:24:49.384 --> 01:24:49.818
CORRIDOR IS PARTICULARLY

01:24:49.884 --> 01:24:51.419
IMPORTANT.

01:24:51.486 --> 01:24:53.421
AT LEAST THOUGHT OF ON AND THOSE

01:24:53.488 --> 01:24:53.988
OF US WORKING ON TRUST JAIL

01:24:54.055 --> 01:24:55.990
TAXES.

01:24:56.057 --> 01:24:56.925
SO WHAT OF ONE CREATED TO

01:24:56.991 --> 01:24:58.693
TWERKING LANCE PROGRAM WITH A

01:24:58.760 --> 01:24:59.961
VISION OF HELPING TO CREATE WITH

01:25:00.028 --> 01:25:01.463
IN CALIFORNIA.

01:25:01.529 --> 01:25:03.364
A MATRIX OF WORKING LANDS AND

01:25:03.431 --> 01:25:04.999
MANAGED WETLANDS PROVIDE FOR

01:25:05.066 --> 01:25:07.168
THIS LONG TERM SUSTAINABLE.

01:25:07.235 --> 01:25:09.337
CONSERVATION AND IS EXECUTED TWO

01:25:09.404 --> 01:25:10.638
ON THE GROUND STAFF WE HAVE --

01:25:10.705 --> 01:25:13.408
SEVENTY THOUSAND ACRES OF LAND.

01:25:13.475 --> 01:25:15.243
OPERATE INCLUDING A ACT OF

01:25:15.310 --> 01:25:16.711
CATTLE RANCH OUTSIDE OF WINTERS

01:25:16.778 --> 01:25:18.346
AS WELL AS BIOLOGISTS AN ANALYST

01:25:18.413 --> 01:25:20.548
TO GO OUT TO WORK WITH PARTNERS

01:25:20.615 --> 01:25:22.217
LIKE PAUL AND THE LANDOWNERS.

01:25:22.283 --> 01:25:23.551
AND WHAT WE TRY TO DO ON OUR

01:25:23.618 --> 01:25:25.854
LAND AND OTHER IS DEVELOP PILOT

01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:27.555
PROJECTS THAT CAN BE SCALED UP

01:25:27.622 --> 01:25:28.957
FOR LAND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES

01:25:29.023 --> 01:25:30.258
ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT PAUL

01:25:30.325 --> 01:25:31.726
PARTY MENTIONED.

01:25:31.793 --> 01:25:32.527
AND I WANNA MENTION AND

01:25:32.594 --> 01:25:34.429
EMPHASIZE WE DON'T DO THAT ALLOW

01:25:34.496 --> 01:25:35.730
NOT ONLY IS THE PARTNERS --

01:25:35.797 --> 01:25:37.298
AMONG FARMERS AND THEIR

01:25:37.365 --> 01:25:39.133
REPRESENTATIVES BUT ALSO WE'RE

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:40.168
PART THE MIGRATORY BIRD

01:25:40.235 --> 01:25:41.436
CONSERVATION PARTNERSHIP WITH

01:25:41.503 --> 01:25:42.537
THE NATURE OF WITH THE NATURE

01:25:42.604 --> 01:25:43.838
CONSERVANCY AND POINT BLUE

01:25:43.905 --> 01:25:45.707
CONSERVATION SCIENCE.

01:25:45.773 --> 01:25:46.741
AND I THINK THERE'S BEEN IMMENSE

01:25:46.808 --> 01:25:48.309
WORK DONE BY OTHER PARTNERS

01:25:48.376 --> 01:25:49.511
INCLUDING DUCKS UNLIMITED IN

01:25:49.577 --> 01:25:50.912
CALIFORNIA WATERFOWL.

01:25:50.979 --> 01:25:52.413
AND MANY OTHERS THAT ARE TRYING

01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:53.681
TO WORK ON THIS NOTION OF THE

01:25:53.748 --> 01:25:55.450
MATRIX OF MANAGED AND NATURAL

01:25:55.517 --> 01:25:58.353
LANDS.

01:25:58.419 --> 01:25:58.953
SO TODAY WE'VE HAD SOME PRETTY

01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:00.421
SIGNIFICANT.

01:26:00.488 --> 01:26:01.523
ACCOMPLISHMENTS DURING THE

01:26:01.589 --> 01:26:03.157
DROUGHT WHEN HABITAT WAS

01:26:03.224 --> 01:26:04.893
SHRINKING ALL AROUND US WE STILL

01:26:04.959 --> 01:26:06.561
MANAGE TO WORK WITH PARTNERS TO

01:26:06.628 --> 01:26:07.996
SECURE A HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES

01:26:08.062 --> 01:26:09.964
OF IRRIGATED CROPLAND.

01:26:10.031 --> 01:26:12.734
THAT PROVIDED ACT OF HABITAT FOR

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:14.502
WATERFOWL AND AND SHORE BIRDS

01:26:14.569 --> 01:26:15.937
THAT WERE REALLY STRESSED DURING

01:26:16.004 --> 01:26:16.938
THIS PROLONGED DROUGHT.

01:26:17.005 --> 01:26:17.939
AND WE DID THAT IN PART WITH AN

01:26:18.006 --> 01:26:19.641
INVESTMENT OF OF OVER FIFTEEN

01:26:19.707 --> 01:26:20.375
MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL

01:26:20.441 --> 01:26:21.976
FUNDING THAT WENT TO THE

01:26:22.043 --> 01:26:23.444
LANDOWNERS IN ORDER TO HELP THEM

01:26:23.511 --> 01:26:25.380
MAKE THAT HAPPEN FOR THE KIND OF

01:26:25.446 --> 01:26:25.914
PRACTICES THE PAUL ALREADY

01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:27.715
MENTIONED.

01:26:27.782 --> 01:26:28.950
I WE'VE ALSO --

01:26:29.017 --> 01:26:32.487
AND ENGAGE THOUSANDS OF

01:26:32.554 --> 01:26:34.355
LANDOWNERS TO SHARE RESOURCES

01:26:34.422 --> 01:26:35.423
AND CONNECT WITH EACH OTHER LAND

01:26:35.490 --> 01:26:36.457
OWNERSHIP DIDN'T KNOW EACH OTHER

01:26:36.524 --> 01:26:38.026
PRIOR TO WORKSHOPS AND OTHER

01:26:38.092 --> 01:26:39.093
TRAINING SESSIONS.

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:40.395
IN ORDER TO ALLOW THEM TO TRADE

01:26:40.461 --> 01:26:42.130
INFORMATION ON WHAT WHAT IS WORK

01:26:42.196 --> 01:26:43.331
ON THEIR LANDS BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:26:43.398 --> 01:26:44.699
THE ONES WHO KNOW BEST THAT THE

01:26:44.766 --> 01:26:45.900
ONES MANAGING THOSE LANDS.

01:26:45.967 --> 01:26:47.235
AND SHARE INFORMATION ON

01:26:47.302 --> 01:26:49.137
RESOURCES FOR EXAMPLE THE KIND

01:26:49.203 --> 01:26:50.271
OF GRANTS AND FUNDING --

01:26:50.338 --> 01:26:52.140
JOHN MENTIONED EARLIER. TWO

01:26:52.206 --> 01:26:53.675
OTHER SPECIFIC EXAMPLES I'D LIKE

01:26:53.741 --> 01:26:55.643
TO PROVIDE THAT ARE RECENT AND

01:26:55.710 --> 01:26:57.278
HAVE I THINK DEMONSTRATED HOW

01:26:57.345 --> 01:26:59.080
NGOS AND THE COMMUNITY COURT

01:26:59.147 --> 01:27:00.715
TOGETHER.

01:27:00.782 --> 01:27:02.283
A THE FIRST IS WITH THE ROBINS

01:27:02.350 --> 01:27:04.319
RICE COMPANY AND AUDUBON CREATED

01:27:04.385 --> 01:27:06.921
THE FIRST EVER AND BURKE FAMILY

01:27:06.988 --> 01:27:08.556
RICE CERTIFICATION PROGRAM.

01:27:08.623 --> 01:27:09.824
AND NOW ROBIN'S RICE ACTUALLY

01:27:09.891 --> 01:27:11.726
HAS A LABEL THAT THEY PUT HOW

01:27:11.793 --> 01:27:12.727
FOR MARKETING ON THEIR RACE

01:27:12.794 --> 01:27:14.162
PRODUCTS.

01:27:14.228 --> 01:27:16.297
AND THEY DIDTHAT IN

01:27:16.364 --> 01:27:17.765
CONSULTATION WITH US TO MAKE

01:27:17.832 --> 01:27:18.766
SURE THAT THERE PROJECT OTHER

01:27:18.833 --> 01:27:19.834
PRODUCT ALL THE WAY FROM THE

01:27:19.901 --> 01:27:22.704
GROUND TO TO PROCESSING WAS AS

01:27:22.770 --> 01:27:24.038
BIRD FAMILY AS POSSIBLE.

01:27:24.105 --> 01:27:25.373
AND I THINK THAT THERE'S

01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:26.541
OPPORTUNITIES TO CONTINUE TO

01:27:26.608 --> 01:27:27.809
WORK IN THAT KIND OF PARTNERSHIP

01:27:27.875 --> 01:27:29.444
TOGETHER TO HELP BOOST THEIR

01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:30.211
SALES AND ALSO.

01:27:30.278 --> 01:27:32.547
CREATE A A PIPELINE OF

01:27:32.614 --> 01:27:33.781
SUSTAINABILITY IN THEIR IN THEIR

01:27:33.848 --> 01:27:35.817
PRODUCT.

01:27:35.883 --> 01:27:36.751
THE LAST ONE IS A LITTLE MORE

01:27:36.818 --> 01:27:40.021
CONTROVERSY ON NOW BUT RECENTLY

01:27:40.088 --> 01:27:40.622
THE TRI COLOR BLACK BIRD WAS

01:27:40.688 --> 01:27:42.757
LISTED AS AN ENDANGERED SPECIES

01:27:42.824 --> 01:27:43.491
IN THE STATE.

01:27:43.558 --> 01:27:45.560
AND AUDUBON WORKED VERY CLOSELY

01:27:45.627 --> 01:27:46.694
WITH THE FARM BUREAU AND THE

01:27:46.761 --> 01:27:47.996
DAIRY INDUSTRY AND EVEN THOUGH

01:27:48.062 --> 01:27:49.530
WE DISAGREED AS TO WHETHER THAT

01:27:49.597 --> 01:27:50.665
SPECIES SHOULD BE LISTED AS

01:27:50.732 --> 01:27:51.799
ENDANGERED OR NOT.

01:27:51.866 --> 01:27:53.301
EVEN DURING I'D SAY MAYBE THE

01:27:53.368 --> 01:27:55.403
MOST CONTENTIOUS PARTS OF THAT

01:27:55.470 --> 01:27:57.071
DEBATE AROUND THE SPECIES THERE

01:27:57.138 --> 01:27:58.539
WAS STILL A VERY STRONG AND

01:27:58.606 --> 01:27:59.741
PRODUCTIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

01:27:59.807 --> 01:28:00.808
AUDUBON.

01:28:00.875 --> 01:28:01.943
AND THE DAIRY INDUSTRY AND THE

01:28:02.010 --> 01:28:02.944
FARM BUREAU AND THEY REALLY

01:28:03.011 --> 01:28:04.512
STEPPED UP TO GO OUT AND EDUCATE

01:28:04.579 --> 01:28:05.480
LANDOWNERS.

01:28:05.546 --> 01:28:07.015
AND TRY TO WORK ON IN OUR CS

01:28:07.081 --> 01:28:08.783
PROGRAM WHICH WE SUCCESSFULLY

01:28:08.850 --> 01:28:09.917
USED AS WELL AS LEVERAGING

01:28:09.984 --> 01:28:10.685
PRIVATE.

01:28:10.752 --> 01:28:11.586
HOME FUNDING IN SOME OF OUT OF

01:28:11.653 --> 01:28:14.222
ONE'S OWN FUNDING.

01:28:14.288 --> 01:28:15.723
WHO ARE BURDENED BY HAVING THIS

01:28:15.790 --> 01:28:16.357
SHE'S ON THE LAND AND THEY WERE

01:28:16.424 --> 01:28:19.527
TRYING?

01:28:19.594 --> 01:28:20.395
TO HARVEST THEIR CROPS TO FEED

01:28:20.461 --> 01:28:22.096
THEIR COWS.

01:28:22.163 --> 01:28:23.297
AND SO I THINK THAT IS AN

01:28:23.364 --> 01:28:25.099
EXAMPLE ON THAT WE CONTINUE TO

01:28:25.166 --> 01:28:27.535
BE PROUD AT AND WILL CONTINUE TO

01:28:27.602 --> 01:28:28.369
WORK ON NOT ONLY ON TRICOLOR

01:28:28.436 --> 01:28:29.537
BLACKBIRD BECAUSE THERE'S MORE

01:28:29.604 --> 01:28:31.506
WORK TO BE DONE EVEN OF THE

01:28:31.572 --> 01:28:32.473
SPECIES IS STILL.

01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:34.342
LISTED BUT IN ORDER IN THE

01:28:34.409 --> 01:28:36.110
FUTURE TO TRY TO FIND FUNNY

01:28:36.177 --> 01:28:37.545
MONEY TO INCENTIVIZE HE'S KIND

01:28:37.612 --> 01:28:38.980
OF PROJECTS.

01:28:39.047 --> 01:28:40.148
THAT'S A GOOD EXAMPLE THAT WENT

01:28:40.214 --> 01:28:41.783
WHERE EVEN SOMETHING IS AS

01:28:41.849 --> 01:28:42.383
CONTENTIOUS IS AN ENDANGERED

01:28:42.450 --> 01:28:44.419
SPECIES THERE CAN STILL BE A LOT

01:28:44.485 --> 01:28:45.887
OF ROOM TO WORK NOT OF MINE AND

01:28:45.953 --> 01:28:47.255
MANY OTHER NGOS ARE TRYING TO

01:28:47.321 --> 01:28:48.523
FIND WAYS TO REDUCE THE BURDENS

01:28:48.589 --> 01:28:49.424
ON LANDOWNERS.

01:28:49.490 --> 01:28:50.725
BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IS

01:28:50.792 --> 01:28:52.527
TO INCENTIVIZE LANDOWNERS TO

01:28:52.593 --> 01:28:53.127
INVITE THIS SPECIES ON THEIR

01:28:53.194 --> 01:28:54.996
LAND AND MAINTAIN THEM SO WE CAN

01:28:55.063 --> 01:28:57.131
DO SAFE HARBOR PROJECT PROJECTS

01:28:57.198 --> 01:28:58.499
AND REGULATIONS.

01:28:58.566 --> 01:29:01.002
AND AND OR SOME OTHER SORT OF

01:29:01.069 --> 01:29:02.437
AVENUES THAT WE CAN PROVIDE SOME

01:29:02.503 --> 01:29:05.473
RELIEF TO LANDOWNERS ON LOOKING

01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:07.041
FORWARD I THINK WE'VE ALL TALKED

01:29:07.108 --> 01:29:08.176
ABOUT THE CLIMATE CHANGE THE

01:29:08.242 --> 01:29:09.944
IMMENSE CHALLENGES. FOR SPECIES

01:29:10.011 --> 01:29:11.045
IN CALIFORNIA ALONE THERE'S AT

01:29:11.112 --> 01:29:12.380
LEAST A HUNDRED EIGHTY SPECIES

01:29:12.447 --> 01:29:14.315
THAT ARE MORE LIKELY TO GO AT

01:29:14.382 --> 01:29:16.184
LEAST TOWARD EXTINCTION.

01:29:16.250 --> 01:29:16.884
CLIMATE CHANGE OVER THE NEXT

01:29:16.951 --> 01:29:18.252
EIGHTY YEARS SO FROM OUR

01:29:18.319 --> 01:29:19.587
PERSPECTIVE CLIMATE CHANGES OR

01:29:19.654 --> 01:29:21.089
AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT FOR A LOT

01:29:21.155 --> 01:29:21.989
OF SPECIES.

01:29:22.056 --> 01:29:23.057
AND NOW WE SEE ADDITIONAL

01:29:23.124 --> 01:29:24.392
PRESSURES ON FARMLAND AND

01:29:24.459 --> 01:29:25.760
NATURAL LANCE'S WAS ALREADY

01:29:25.827 --> 01:29:26.594
DISCUSSED.

01:29:26.661 --> 01:29:27.295
OBVIOUSLY WATER SUPPLY

01:29:27.361 --> 01:29:30.565
CHALLENGES WILL.

01:29:30.631 --> 01:29:32.533
SINGLE GROUNDWATER BUT AGAIN AS

01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:34.168
DROUGHTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE

01:29:34.235 --> 01:29:36.003
PROLONGED HOW WE GOING.

01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:37.004
TO PROVIDE THAT WATER TO

01:29:37.071 --> 01:29:39.073
DIFFERENT LAND USES AND ALSO

01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:40.775
PROVIDE FOR BY DIVERSITY.

01:29:40.842 --> 01:29:43.644
AND THEN POPULATION GROWTH AND

01:29:43.711 --> 01:29:45.413
AND IT'S KIND OF URBAN EXPANSION

01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:46.547
INTO NATURAL AND WORKING LANCE

01:29:46.614 --> 01:29:48.549
IS A HUGE CONCERN.

01:29:48.616 --> 01:29:49.150
IT'S JUST SOME OF THE

01:29:49.217 --> 01:29:51.119
OPPORTUNITIES WE SEEK TO WORK ON

01:29:51.185 --> 01:29:52.320
THOSE AND I'VE MENTION THESE BUT

01:29:52.386 --> 01:29:53.688
I WANNA MAKE SURE WE HAD A HIT

01:29:53.755 --> 01:29:55.089
ON THEM JUST FOR FOR I'VE

01:29:55.156 --> 01:29:56.557
STOPPED HERE WHICH IS.

01:29:56.624 --> 01:29:57.725
ONE LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO

01:29:57.792 --> 01:29:59.260
INCREASE FUNDING TO ASSIST

01:29:59.327 --> 01:30:00.995
FARMERS AND RANCHERS --

01:30:01.062 --> 01:30:02.163
A TO KEEP DOING WHAT THEY'RE

01:30:02.230 --> 01:30:03.931
DOING AND ALSO WHERE POSSIBLE TO

01:30:03.998 --> 01:30:05.967
IMPROVE PRACTICES EITHER FOR THE

01:30:06.033 --> 01:30:07.602
KIND OF GHQ BENEFITS MATT.

01:30:07.668 --> 01:30:09.237
MANAGE HOWEVER MENTIONED ALREADY

01:30:09.303 --> 01:30:10.538
OR INCREASING BURKE FAMILY

01:30:10.605 --> 01:30:12.807
PRACTICES --

01:30:12.874 --> 01:30:15.109
WE WANT TO TRY TO FIND A

01:30:15.176 --> 01:30:16.844
BALANCED WATER SUPPLY MANAGER

01:30:16.911 --> 01:30:18.546
PROGRAM THAT WORKS FOR EVERYBODY

01:30:18.613 --> 01:30:19.947
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IF THAT

01:30:20.014 --> 01:30:20.548
DOESN'T AND THERE'S A LOT MORE

01:30:20.615 --> 01:30:21.682
CONTENTION.

01:30:21.749 --> 01:30:23.284
FIGHTING OVER THAT VERY OFTEN

01:30:23.351 --> 01:30:24.652
THE ENVIRONMENT AND BERGSON

01:30:24.719 --> 01:30:26.921
HABITAT A GOING TO LOSE FIRST.

01:30:26.988 --> 01:30:28.055
AND SO IT'S IN OUR INTEREST TO

01:30:28.122 --> 01:30:29.190
TRY TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE THOSE

01:30:29.257 --> 01:30:31.025
THINGS WORK TOGETHER --

01:30:31.092 --> 01:30:32.860
AND THE LAST PIECE I WANTED TO

01:30:32.927 --> 01:30:34.862
MENTION WAS REALLY ON FINING

01:30:34.929 --> 01:30:36.264
KELABIT SOLUTIONS AGAIN ON

01:30:36.330 --> 01:30:38.232
SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES --

01:30:38.299 --> 01:30:40.001
WHEREVER POSSIBLE TO SAFE HARBOR

01:30:40.067 --> 01:30:41.269
AGREEMENTS IN THESE KIND OF

01:30:41.335 --> 01:30:41.869
FUNDING INCENTIVE PROGRAMS BY

01:30:41.936 --> 01:30:43.838
NRCS [inaudible]

01:30:43.905 --> 01:30:46.440
LASTLY I BUT THERE'S A LOT OF ON

01:30:46.507 --> 01:30:47.642
IS A SCIENCE BASED ORGANIZATION

01:30:47.708 --> 01:30:49.443
WANTS TO EMPHASIZE THAT WITH ALL

01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:50.178
THESE MATCH PRACTICES ALSO

01:30:50.244 --> 01:30:51.612
BECOMES A NEED. TO INVEST IN

01:30:51.679 --> 01:30:53.181
SCIENCE.

01:30:53.247 --> 01:30:54.582
AND WHEN WE CAN DO MY MONEY

01:30:54.649 --> 01:30:55.883
TRAIN IN ADDITIONAL SCIENTIFIC

01:30:55.950 --> 01:30:58.052
INVESTMENTS WE CAN FIND WAYS TO

01:30:58.119 --> 01:30:59.554
MANAGE THE TIMING AND MANAGEMENT

01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:00.822
OF THINGS LIKE WATER LIKE PAUL

01:31:00.888 --> 01:31:02.023
MENTIONED ABOUT WHEN THAT SHOULD

01:31:02.089 --> 01:31:03.758
GO ON THE LANDSCAPE. TO MAXIMIZE

01:31:03.825 --> 01:31:05.393
BENEFITS TO SPECIES WILL ALSO

01:31:05.459 --> 01:31:07.028
REDUCING THE BURN THE BURDENS ON

01:31:07.094 --> 01:31:08.429
THE LANDOWNERS.

01:31:08.496 --> 01:31:10.498
AND I THINK WHEN WE DO THAT WE

01:31:10.565 --> 01:31:11.966
ACTUALLY FIND WAYS TO REDUCE

01:31:12.033 --> 01:31:13.201
POTENTIAL CONFLICTS BETWEEN

01:31:13.267 --> 01:31:14.068
CONSERVATIONISTS AND THE

01:31:14.135 --> 01:31:15.369
AGRICULTURAL SECTOR.

01:31:15.436 --> 01:31:17.405
THANK YOU WRITTEN.

01:31:17.471 --> 01:31:20.341
THANK YOU VERY MUCH VERY HELPFUL.

ABOUT THE LAST TWENTY YEARS.

01:31:32.753 --> 01:31:34.622
A ITS OUR INDUSTRY COALITION

01:31:34.689 --> 01:31:35.923
THAT INVOLVES THE ENTIRE DAIRY

01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:37.825
INDUSTRY THAT WORKS EXCLUSIVELY

01:31:37.892 --> 01:31:39.293
ON SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES SO.

01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:40.962
I'M REALLY GONNA FOCUS TODAY ON

01:31:41.028 --> 01:31:41.829
SOME OF THE METHANE REDUCTION

01:31:41.896 --> 01:31:43.197
EFFORTS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A

01:31:43.264 --> 01:31:44.332
TREMENDOUS STORY.

01:31:44.398 --> 01:31:45.967
AND THEN BRIEFLY TALK ABOUT SOME

01:31:46.033 --> 01:31:47.068
OF THE OTHER EXTENSIVE

01:31:47.134 --> 01:31:48.469
SUSTAINABILITY PROJECTS THAT THE

01:31:48.536 --> 01:31:51.505
INDUSTRY IS WORKING ON OUR DAIRY

01:31:51.572 --> 01:31:54.141
METHANE REDUCTION STRATEGY IS --

01:31:54.208 --> 01:31:55.776
MEUM BEEN WIDELY DISCUSSED IN IN

01:31:55.843 --> 01:31:57.111
THE LEGISLATURE THE LAST FEW

01:31:57.178 --> 01:31:58.079
YEARS -- BUT

01:31:58.145 --> 01:32:01.115
WE HAVE A A REALLY GOOD.

01:32:01.182 --> 01:32:02.550
PLACE AND IT'S BASED ON THREE

01:32:02.617 --> 01:32:04.185
PRIMARY APPROACHES AND THAT'S

01:32:04.252 --> 01:32:05.920
COOPERATING WITH THE AIR

01:32:05.987 --> 01:32:07.488
RESOURCES BOARD DEPARTMENT OF

01:32:07.555 --> 01:32:08.890
FOOD AND AGRICULTURE THE ENERGY

01:32:08.956 --> 01:32:10.658
COMMISSION THE CPUC.

01:32:10.725 --> 01:32:12.059
AND OTHER STATE AGENCIES AND I'M

01:32:12.126 --> 01:32:13.527
HAPPY TO REPORT THAT THAT'S A

01:32:13.594 --> 01:32:14.996
VERY PRODUCTIVE WORKING

01:32:15.062 --> 01:32:15.596
RELATIONSHIP.

01:32:15.663 --> 01:32:17.798
RIGHT NOW WITH THREE PRIMARY

01:32:17.865 --> 01:32:19.400
INITIATIVES RESEARCH.

01:32:19.467 --> 01:32:20.868
NOTHING AVOIDANCE AND METHANE

01:32:20.935 --> 01:32:22.270
CAPTURING HIM TO TALK ABOUT BOTH

01:32:22.336 --> 01:32:23.738
OF THOSE.

01:32:23.804 --> 01:32:24.438
AND THEN.

01:32:24.505 --> 01:32:25.840
THIS IS ALL MADE POSSIBLE YOU'VE

01:32:25.907 --> 01:32:26.507
HEARD A LOT TODAY ABOUT

01:32:26.574 --> 01:32:27.975
INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AND I CAN

01:32:28.042 --> 01:32:29.443
TELL YOU THIS WOULD NOT BE

01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:31.646
WORKING EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT.

01:32:31.712 --> 01:32:34.282
SENATOR LARA WINNIE CRAFTED

01:32:34.348 --> 01:32:35.082
THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE RECOGNIZE

01:32:35.149 --> 01:32:37.218
AND SENATE BATES PROGRAM WAS

01:32:37.285 --> 01:32:38.953
GOING TO BE NECESSARY HERE.

01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:39.921
AND THE GOVERNOR AND THIS

01:32:39.987 --> 01:32:41.522
LEGISLATURE HAS STEPPED UP OVER

01:32:41.589 --> 01:32:43.758
THE PASSPORT BUDGET CYCLE SOME

01:32:43.824 --> 01:32:45.226
PROVIDED TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY

01:32:45.293 --> 01:32:47.194
MILLION DOLLARS TO CDFA FOR

01:32:47.261 --> 01:32:48.629
DAIRY METHANE REDUCTION.

01:32:48.696 --> 01:32:49.931
SO IT'S A REAL STRAIGHT FORWARD

01:32:49.997 --> 01:32:53.634
APPROACH AND IT'S WORKING WELL --

01:32:53.701 --> 01:32:54.802
SO JUST ON THE RESEARCH SIDE

01:32:54.869 --> 01:32:56.404
WHERE WE'RE DOING A LOT WORKING

01:32:56.470 --> 01:32:58.272
WITH CDFA INNER BE TO BETTER

01:32:58.339 --> 01:32:59.507
UNDERSTAND EMISSIONS TO YOU

01:32:59.573 --> 01:33:00.808
CAN'T CONTROL WHAT YOU DON'T

01:33:00.875 --> 01:33:02.810
UNDERSTAND AND WE'VE NOT ONLY

01:33:02.877 --> 01:33:04.078
WORKED WITH THERE BEING CDFA

01:33:04.145 --> 01:33:05.079
WE'VE WORKED THE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:33:05.146 --> 01:33:06.414
DEFENSE FUND ANOTHER PRIVATE

01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:07.548
ENTITIES. TO TO BETTER

01:33:07.615 --> 01:33:08.849
UNDERSTAND THAT.

01:33:08.916 --> 01:33:10.618
AND A A REPORT WILL BE PUBLISHED

01:33:10.685 --> 01:33:12.620
SOON FROM EDF LOOKING AT THAT

01:33:12.687 --> 01:33:14.388
SOME OF THE AREAS WERE VERY

01:33:14.455 --> 01:33:15.723
EMISSIONS CURVE.

01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:16.757
WE'RE WORKING TO QUANTIFY THE

01:33:16.824 --> 01:33:18.726
BENEFITS THE TECHNOLOGIES FOR IN

01:33:18.793 --> 01:33:19.827
THE FIELD NOW DOCTOR FRANK MET

01:33:19.894 --> 01:33:21.529
LONER FROM UC DAVIS TO LOOK AT

01:33:21.595 --> 01:33:23.164
SOME OF THE ALTERNATE MANURE

01:33:23.230 --> 01:33:23.831
MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND

01:33:23.898 --> 01:33:25.032
QUANTIFY.

01:33:25.099 --> 01:33:27.134
THOSE BENEFITS WERE LOOKING FOR

01:33:27.201 --> 01:33:28.369
OTHER METHANE REDUCTION

01:33:28.436 --> 01:33:29.837
OPPORTUNITIES CONSTANTLY AND

01:33:29.904 --> 01:33:31.772
THEN WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING. TO

01:33:31.839 --> 01:33:33.607
MAKE SURE AND AND VALIDATE.

01:33:33.674 --> 01:33:35.142
WHAT IT IS WORK COMP PUSHING AND

01:33:35.209 --> 01:33:36.377
SO?

01:33:36.444 --> 01:33:38.279
IT'S A GREAT STORY THE AMP

01:33:38.346 --> 01:33:39.814
PROGRAM HAS NOW FUNDED EIGHTEEN

01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:41.649
PROJECTS.

01:33:41.716 --> 01:33:42.483
ARE THERE GOING TO BE FUNDING

01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:44.118
PROBABLY AT LEAST ANOTHER FORTY

01:33:44.185 --> 01:33:45.853
MORE HERE IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS

01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:47.388
WE EXPECT THEM TO BE ANNOUNCED

01:33:47.455 --> 01:33:49.724
BY CDFA THIS MONTH --

01:33:49.790 --> 01:33:51.492
SO I IT'S A VERY SIGNIFICANT

01:33:51.559 --> 01:33:52.893
PROGRAM ARTIST AT SOME OF THE

01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:55.930
HIGH POINTS MORE THAN --

01:33:55.997 --> 01:33:56.831
SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND TOTAL

01:33:56.897 --> 01:33:58.766
METRIC TONS OF CO TWO WE JUST

01:33:58.833 --> 01:33:59.600
FROM THOSE FIRST EIGHTEEN

01:33:59.667 --> 01:34:01.902
PROJECTS --

01:34:01.969 --> 01:34:03.237
WE EXPECT.

01:34:03.304 --> 01:34:04.839
AND THAT THESE PROJECTS AND WILL

01:34:04.905 --> 01:34:06.040
HAVE AT LEAST A HUNDRED AND

01:34:06.107 --> 01:34:08.576
TWENTY OF THEM OPERATING BY

01:34:08.642 --> 01:34:09.210
TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO VERY FAST

01:34:09.276 --> 01:34:10.144
RAMP UP.

01:34:10.211 --> 01:34:11.278
FROM EIGHTEEN IN THE INITIAL

01:34:11.345 --> 01:34:12.747
ROUND MAYBE AS MANY AS A HUNDRED

01:34:12.813 --> 01:34:14.448
AND TWENTY BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO

01:34:14.515 --> 01:34:17.685
AND AT THAT.

01:34:17.752 --> 01:34:19.353
BASED ON CURRENT ESTIMATES ABOUT

01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:21.455
THREE POINT FIVE MILLION METRIC

01:34:21.522 --> 01:34:23.791
TONS OF CO TWO WE OVER A TEN

01:34:23.858 --> 01:34:24.892
YEAR LIFE CYCLE.

01:34:24.959 --> 01:34:26.093
AS IT'S VERY TREMENDOUS AND

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:27.495
THESE ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED ON

01:34:27.561 --> 01:34:29.797
VERY SMALL DAIRIES TWO HUNDRED

01:34:29.864 --> 01:34:31.465
FIFTY CALS TO SOME VERY LARGE

01:34:31.532 --> 01:34:33.300
DAIRIES OF SEVEN HUNDRED

01:34:33.367 --> 01:34:33.901
THOUSAND IN A KIND OF RUN THE

01:34:33.968 --> 01:34:35.503
GAMUT OF CONVERTING FROM FLESH

01:34:35.569 --> 01:34:36.670
TO SCRAPE.

01:34:36.737 --> 01:34:38.139
SOME PASTOR BASED PROGRAMS AND

01:34:38.205 --> 01:34:39.807
THEN THE EXTENSIVE USE OF SOLID

01:34:39.874 --> 01:34:41.342
SEPARATION ON SOME OF THESE

01:34:41.409 --> 01:34:42.443
DAIRIES.

01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:44.545
THAT TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF OF

01:34:44.612 --> 01:34:46.113
NOTHING THAT GOES.

01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:47.148
AMOUNT OF THE NEWER THAT GOES

01:34:47.214 --> 01:34:48.582
INTO A LOOK AND AMOUNT OF

01:34:48.649 --> 01:34:49.717
METHANE IT PRODUCES.

01:34:49.784 --> 01:34:52.019
THE DEBATE I JUST A PROGRAM IS A

01:34:52.086 --> 01:34:55.823
TREMENDOUS SUCCESS STORY AS WELL --

01:34:55.890 --> 01:34:56.891
SIXTY FOUR PROJECTS HAVE BEEN

01:34:56.957 --> 01:34:58.159
FUNDED TO DATE ACHIEVING

01:34:58.225 --> 01:35:00.528
ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS OF THIRTEEN

01:35:00.594 --> 01:35:02.963
MILLION METRIC TONS OF CO TWO E.

01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:04.799
OVER THIRTEEN YEARS.

01:35:04.865 --> 01:35:07.134
THE COST OF THOSE REDUCTIONS ARE

01:35:07.201 --> 01:35:08.903
JUST TWENTY SEVEN DOLLARS PORTAL

01:35:08.969 --> 01:35:10.071
ALL IN.

01:35:10.137 --> 01:35:10.905
AND THE COST OF THE STATE IS

01:35:10.971 --> 01:35:14.909
JUST. EIGHT DOLLARS A METRIC TON.

01:35:14.975 --> 01:35:17.812
SO IT IS THE THIRD MOST COST

01:35:17.878 --> 01:35:18.779
EFFECTIVE INVESTMENT THIS

01:35:18.846 --> 01:35:20.181
LEGISLATURE IN THIS GOVERNMENT

01:35:20.247 --> 01:35:21.615
IS MAKING WITH THE GT R. F.

01:35:21.682 --> 01:35:23.517
FUNDS.

01:35:23.584 --> 01:35:25.486
AND AS A OR B. REPORTED IN THEIR

01:35:25.553 --> 01:35:27.688
LAST REPORT IT'S THE NUMBER ONE

01:35:27.755 --> 01:35:30.057
MOST EFFECTIVE PROGRAM IN

01:35:30.124 --> 01:35:32.626
ACHIEVING TOTAL GHG REDUCTIONS.

01:35:32.693 --> 01:35:34.028
AND IT'S ALL NOTHING WHICH MEANS

01:35:34.095 --> 01:35:35.429
WE'RE GONNA SEE THE BENEFITS OF

01:35:35.496 --> 01:35:37.398
IT MUCH SOONER THAN OTHER CO TWO

01:35:37.465 --> 01:35:38.899
REDUCTION PROGRAMS SO.

01:35:38.966 --> 01:35:41.202
SO THAT THAT.

01:35:41.268 --> 01:35:42.369
STATISTICS IS PROBABLY THE MOST

01:35:42.436 --> 01:35:43.938
IMPORTANT NUMBER.

01:35:44.004 --> 01:35:46.407
AND THAT THE WHOLE REASON FOR

01:35:46.474 --> 01:35:47.875
THE HEARING QUITE FRANKLY IS

01:35:47.942 --> 01:35:48.542
THAT.

01:35:48.609 --> 01:35:50.111
AS WE DISCUSSED.

01:35:50.177 --> 01:35:52.113
CAP AND TRADE.

01:35:52.179 --> 01:35:53.848
AND SPENDING AND WHERE IT SHOULD

01:35:53.914 --> 01:35:55.316
GO AND HOW IT SHOULD BE

01:35:55.382 --> 01:35:59.820
ALLOCATED --

01:35:59.887 --> 01:36:01.655
IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT WE LOST

01:36:01.722 --> 01:36:02.056
THE MORE LIBERAL.

01:36:02.123 --> 01:36:04.225
MEMBERS.

01:36:04.291 --> 01:36:06.594
OF THE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS BECAUSE

01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:08.162
THEY DIDN'T FEEL THAT IT WAS

01:36:08.229 --> 01:36:09.864
GOING TO GET THE MOST BANG FOR

01:36:09.930 --> 01:36:11.132
ITS BUCK OR TOO MUCH WAS GOING

01:36:11.198 --> 01:36:13.434
TO AGRICULTURE.

01:36:13.501 --> 01:36:14.969
BUT I I AM.

01:36:15.035 --> 01:36:16.470
THIS IS WHY THIS HEARING BECOMES

01:36:16.537 --> 01:36:17.271
REAL IMPORTANT BECAUSE I DON'T

01:36:17.338 --> 01:36:19.406
THINK PEOPLE UNDERSTAND.

01:36:19.473 --> 01:36:22.943
HOW IMPORTANT AGRICULTURE IS TO

01:36:23.010 --> 01:36:23.744
OUR?

01:36:23.811 --> 01:36:26.480
REDUCTION GOALS AND HOW IF WE

01:36:26.547 --> 01:36:28.182
PARTNER.

01:36:28.249 --> 01:36:29.517
WE CAN TAKE CARE OF SOME OF

01:36:29.583 --> 01:36:31.252
THESE ISSUES.

01:36:31.318 --> 01:36:33.254
AT A REALLY COST EFFECTIVE.

01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:35.322
ABOUT RATE SO I AFFECTING QUEUE

01:36:35.389 --> 01:36:36.957
OUR THAT YEAH AND WERE WERE ALL

01:36:37.024 --> 01:36:38.726
ABOUT THE STATISTICS BECAUSE

01:36:38.792 --> 01:36:40.494
THEY'RE JUST SO.

01:36:40.561 --> 01:36:41.996
ARE OVERWHELMING IN TERMS OF

01:36:42.062 --> 01:36:43.564
WHAT IT'S ACHIEVING.

01:36:43.631 --> 01:36:45.032
I ENDED SUGGEST THAT WE SHOULD

01:36:45.099 --> 01:36:46.267
BE DOUBLING DOWN ON THAT

01:36:46.333 --> 01:36:48.702
INVESTMENT NOT BACKING OFF AS WE

01:36:48.769 --> 01:36:49.803
GO WELL AND WAS AS I PUT IT

01:36:49.870 --> 01:36:51.138
PROBABLY SHOULD ADD AS A

01:36:51.205 --> 01:36:52.106
FOOTNOTE THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT

01:36:52.173 --> 01:36:54.375
FOR BOTH ENDS OF OUR CAUCUSES.

01:36:54.441 --> 01:36:56.076
AND IN THE END SOME OF THE

01:36:56.143 --> 01:36:57.511
REPUBLICANS PAID A PRICE FOR

01:36:57.578 --> 01:36:59.513
BEING SUPPORTERS AS WELL SO THAT

01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:00.347
IT.

01:37:00.414 --> 01:37:01.749
IT BECAUSE IT HIT RIGHT IN THE

01:37:01.815 --> 01:37:02.917
MIDDLE AND THERE WERE A LOT OF

01:37:02.983 --> 01:37:04.418
AYE SUPPORTING IT WAS DIFFICULT

01:37:04.485 --> 01:37:07.354
FOR OUR CAN BOTH ENDS OF OUR ARE

01:37:07.421 --> 01:37:09.557
ORGANIZATIONS. TO TO COME

01:37:09.623 --> 01:37:10.658
ONBOARD SO THIS STATE IS REALLY

01:37:10.724 --> 01:37:11.358
IMPORTANT.

01:37:11.425 --> 01:37:12.927
ISSUE IT IT'S TREMENDOUS AND

01:37:12.993 --> 01:37:14.161
JUST A FEW YEARS AGO WE HAD

01:37:14.228 --> 01:37:16.430
TWELVE PROJECTS AND BY TWENTY

01:37:16.497 --> 01:37:16.997
TWENTY TO GIVEN THE CURRENT

01:37:17.064 --> 01:37:18.232
LEVELS OF FUNDING THAT ARE FOR

01:37:18.299 --> 01:37:19.600
READY BEEN APPROPRIATED BY THIS

01:37:19.667 --> 01:37:21.001
LEGISLATURE.

01:37:21.068 --> 01:37:23.037
WE EXPECT TO HAVE AS MANY AS A

01:37:23.103 --> 01:37:24.805
HUNDRED AND TWENTY PROJECTS ON

01:37:24.872 --> 01:37:26.273
PREDICTS A TENFOLD INCREASE.

01:37:26.340 --> 01:37:27.942
IN JUST A FEW SHORT YEARS AND

01:37:28.008 --> 01:37:29.577
MOST OF THESE NEW PROJECTS ARE

01:37:29.643 --> 01:37:31.111
OF THE RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS

01:37:31.178 --> 01:37:32.479
VARIETY NOT THE ELECTRICITY

01:37:32.546 --> 01:37:33.747
PRODUCTION VARIETY.

01:37:33.814 --> 01:37:35.282
WHICH MEANS ARE ALSO GOING TO BE

01:37:35.349 --> 01:37:37.351
PROVIDING TRANSPORTATION FEEL.

01:37:37.418 --> 01:37:37.918
THAT WILL REPLACE DIESEL AND

01:37:37.985 --> 01:37:40.588
WE'LL SEE CRITERIA POLLUTANT

01:37:40.654 --> 01:37:42.189
REDUCTIONS.

01:37:42.256 --> 01:37:43.691
IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY IN THE

01:37:43.757 --> 01:37:44.825
SOUTH COAST AND OTHER

01:37:44.892 --> 01:37:46.627
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AROUND

01:37:46.694 --> 01:37:48.529
THE STATE SO IT'S GOT THAT ADDED

01:37:48.596 --> 01:37:50.164
BENEFIT THAT WILL ALSO BE

01:37:50.231 --> 01:37:51.198
QUANTIFYING.

01:37:51.265 --> 01:37:52.866
THE MAP JUST SHOWS YOU THE

01:37:52.933 --> 01:37:54.835
TREMENDOUS PROGRESS THE CITY

01:37:54.902 --> 01:37:55.636
EIGHTY PRODUCTS IN THE STATE

01:37:55.703 --> 01:37:56.637
THAT ARE.

01:37:56.704 --> 01:37:58.239
EITHER OPERATING ON VARIOUS

01:37:58.305 --> 01:37:59.540
STAGES OF PRODUCTION WHERE

01:37:59.607 --> 01:38:00.641
THEY'RE LOCATED THERE'S A HEAVY

01:38:00.708 --> 01:38:02.176
CONCENTRATION IN THE SAN JOAQUIN

01:38:02.243 --> 01:38:04.311
VALLEY AND THINK MISTER SALAS IS

01:38:04.378 --> 01:38:07.514
LEFT BUT AT A BIG OF CLUSTER AYE

01:38:07.581 --> 01:38:09.250
IN KERN COUNTY AS WELL.

01:38:09.316 --> 01:38:10.751
IN TERMS OF SOME OF THESE EARLY

01:38:10.818 --> 01:38:11.785
PROJECTS.

01:38:11.852 --> 01:38:13.654
SO JUST TO SUMMARIZE THE METHANE

01:38:13.721 --> 01:38:14.955
REDUCTION EFFORTS --

01:38:15.022 --> 01:38:16.624
CALIFORNIA RECENTLY BECAME THE

01:38:16.690 --> 01:38:18.092
NATION'S LEADER IN DERRY METHANE

01:38:18.158 --> 01:38:19.760
REDUCTION WE PASS THE OTHER

01:38:19.827 --> 01:38:20.995
STATES I DON'T THINK IT'LL BE

01:38:21.061 --> 01:38:22.429
LONG BEFORE WE PASSED THE Q.

01:38:22.496 --> 01:38:23.564
MOTIVE.

01:38:23.631 --> 01:38:25.065
OF ALL THE OTHER STATES.

01:38:25.132 --> 01:38:26.367
ARE TO BE GIVEN THAT THE PACE

01:38:26.433 --> 01:38:27.735
THAT WE'RE WORKING ON THIS IT'S

01:38:27.801 --> 01:38:28.902
A CRITICAL PIECE OF THE

01:38:28.969 --> 01:38:30.471
INVESTMENT PROGRAM IS YOU'VE

01:38:30.537 --> 01:38:31.739
ALREADY STATED MADAM CHAIR.

01:38:31.805 --> 01:38:33.140
WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED IN

01:38:33.207 --> 01:38:34.575
SHOWING THE ENTIRE WORLD HAD

01:38:34.642 --> 01:38:36.243
JERRY CAN BE PART OF A GLOBAL

01:38:36.310 --> 01:38:37.845
SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEM.

01:38:37.911 --> 01:38:40.047
AND WE ARE MOST IMPORTANTLY ON

01:38:40.114 --> 01:38:41.849
PATH TO ACHIEVE THE 40%

01:38:41.915 --> 01:38:43.083
REDUCTION --

01:38:43.150 --> 01:38:44.218
THAT THE SHORT LIVED CLIMATE

01:38:44.285 --> 01:38:45.819
POLLUTANTS PROGRAM IS LOOKING

01:38:45.886 --> 01:38:46.320
FOR AND MANEUVER METHANE

01:38:46.387 --> 01:38:49.290
EMISSIONS AND DAMN HOPEFULLY.

01:38:49.356 --> 01:38:52.326
WHEN CARP DOES A REPORT IN

01:38:52.393 --> 01:38:53.994
TWENTY TWENTY TWO I WILL BE

01:38:54.061 --> 01:38:55.796
25230% OF THE WAY THEY'RE SO

01:38:55.863 --> 01:38:56.930
IT'S A --

01:38:56.997 --> 01:38:58.599
I'M AGAIN --

01:38:58.666 --> 01:39:01.468
A SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENT REAL

01:39:01.535 --> 01:39:03.103
BRIEFLY SOME OF THE OTHER DAIRY

01:39:03.170 --> 01:39:04.538
SUSTAINABILITY EFFORTS THAT

01:39:04.605 --> 01:39:05.939
WE'RE CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTING

01:39:06.006 --> 01:39:07.508
ACROSS THE STATE.

01:39:07.574 --> 01:39:09.243
ARM WATER USE EFFICIENCY IS A

01:39:09.310 --> 01:39:11.045
BIG AREA OF FOCUS FORCES WALL

01:39:11.111 --> 01:39:12.112
WERE WORKING WITH DRIP

01:39:12.179 --> 01:39:14.148
IRRIGATION ON TWENTY FARMS UP

01:39:14.214 --> 01:39:15.215
AND DOWN THE STATE.

01:39:15.282 --> 01:39:17.017
ON FOOD CROPS ALFALFA ANOTHER

01:39:17.084 --> 01:39:19.286
FEED CROPS AND IT'S SHOWING UP

01:39:19.353 --> 01:39:21.522
TO A 40% WATER SAVINGS.

01:39:21.588 --> 01:39:24.224
AND IN SOME CASES NOT JUST WATER

01:39:24.291 --> 01:39:26.327
SAVINGS BUT INCREASED YIELDS --

01:39:26.393 --> 01:39:27.895
ENERGY USE EFFICIENCIES A BIG

01:39:27.961 --> 01:39:29.229
AREA THIS IS ONE OF THAT THE

01:39:29.296 --> 01:39:30.898
GOOD THINGS THAT P. JEANNIE DOES

01:39:30.964 --> 01:39:32.266
WHEN THEY'RE NOT BURNING DOWN --

01:39:32.333 --> 01:39:35.169
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA OTHER

01:39:35.235 --> 01:39:37.338
HELPING.

01:39:37.404 --> 01:39:38.772
THERE ACHIEVING UP 220%

01:39:38.839 --> 01:39:41.108
REDUCTIONS --

01:39:41.175 --> 01:39:43.043
IN ENERGY USE EFFICIENCY --

01:39:43.110 --> 01:39:44.912
AND THAT'S A COOPERATIVE PROGRAM

01:39:44.978 --> 01:39:46.113
THAT WE WORK WITH BOTH PGD IN

01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:48.949
EDISON ON OUR ELECTRIFYING A LOT

01:39:49.016 --> 01:39:51.018
OF EQUIPMENT A FEED MIXERS AND

01:39:51.085 --> 01:39:52.386
IRRIGATION PUMPS THAT'S ALSO

01:39:52.453 --> 01:39:53.754
PROVIDING SUBSTANTIAL

01:39:53.821 --> 01:39:55.422
ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS.

01:39:55.489 --> 01:39:56.957
ON A RENEWABLE ENERGY STANDPOINT

01:39:57.024 --> 01:39:58.625
I THINK THE DAIRY INDUSTRY IS IS

01:39:58.692 --> 01:40:00.694
WAY OUT IN FRONT WITH MORE THAN

01:40:00.761 --> 01:40:01.462
ONE HUNDRED FARMS HAVING

01:40:01.528 --> 01:40:02.463
INSTALLED.

01:40:02.529 --> 01:40:04.131
A SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS AND THAT

01:40:04.198 --> 01:40:05.699
NUMBER KEEPS GROWING IN A LOT OF

01:40:05.766 --> 01:40:07.067
THAT WAS MADE POSSIBLE BECAUSE

01:40:07.134 --> 01:40:08.369
THE LEGISLATURE.

01:40:08.435 --> 01:40:10.304
HAD THE FORESIGHT TO ALLOW US TO

01:40:10.371 --> 01:40:11.238
AGGREGATE --

01:40:11.305 --> 01:40:12.606
IN THE NET ENERGY METERING

01:40:12.673 --> 01:40:13.607
PROGRAM WHICH REALLY MADE THOSE

01:40:13.674 --> 01:40:14.975
PROJECTS.

01:40:15.042 --> 01:40:16.777
VIABLE FOR WATER QUALITY

01:40:16.844 --> 01:40:18.278
STANDPOINT R. DAIRIES OPERATE

01:40:18.345 --> 01:40:19.446
UNDER VERY STRINGENT

01:40:19.513 --> 01:40:20.881
REQUIREMENTS AND WILL BE MAKING

01:40:20.948 --> 01:40:22.349
FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS THAT

01:40:22.416 --> 01:40:23.617
RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE INDUSTRY

01:40:23.684 --> 01:40:25.619
ARE DOING. TWENTY NINETEEN TO

01:40:25.686 --> 01:40:26.887
THE REGIONAL WATER BOARD AND

01:40:26.954 --> 01:40:28.589
WE'RE WORKING HARD ON THAT AS WE

01:40:28.655 --> 01:40:28.789
SPEAK.

01:40:28.856 --> 01:40:32.993
AND PRODUCTION SIDE BUT THE

01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:34.995
PROCESSING SIDE IS ALSO MAKING

01:40:35.062 --> 01:40:36.797
SIGNIFICANT ADVANCEMENTS.

01:40:36.864 --> 01:40:38.999
OTHERS A NEW PROGRAM THAT'S GAL

01:40:39.066 --> 01:40:41.101
GRANTS ARE APPLICATIONS ARE DUE

01:40:41.168 --> 01:40:42.236
AT THE END OF THIS MONTH THE

01:40:42.302 --> 01:40:43.103
FOOD PRODUCTION INVESTMENT

01:40:43.170 --> 01:40:44.805
PROGRAM WHICH AGAIN WAS FUNDED

01:40:44.872 --> 01:40:46.640
BY THIS LEGISLATURE WITH A

01:40:46.707 --> 01:40:47.374
HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION

01:40:47.441 --> 01:40:48.275
DOLLARS THE LAST TWO BUDGET

01:40:48.342 --> 01:40:49.543
CYCLES.

01:40:49.610 --> 01:40:50.344
AND THAT ALLOW THE DAIRY

01:40:50.411 --> 01:40:51.645
PROCESSING PLANTS AND SHE'S

01:40:51.712 --> 01:40:53.213
MANUFACTURERS TO MAKE SOME

01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:54.882
SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS.

01:40:54.948 --> 01:40:56.550
ON THE PROCESSING SIDE AS WELL

01:40:56.617 --> 01:40:58.652
FROM SUSTAINABILITY STANDPOINT.

01:40:58.719 --> 01:41:02.423
SO ALL JUST CLOSE BY SAYING I'M --

SUSTAINABILITY SUMMIT.

01:41:08.262 --> 01:41:09.062
THAT WE'RE GONNA BE DOING LATER

01:41:09.129 --> 01:41:11.131
THIS YEAR WE JUST ANNOUNCED THAT

01:41:11.198 --> 01:41:13.000
THEY WEBSITE WENT LIVE TODAY --

01:41:13.066 --> 01:41:15.002
IT'LL BE HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND

AND WE THINK IT'LL BE A GREAT

01:41:20.607 --> 01:41:22.342
OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO SHOWCASE

01:41:22.409 --> 01:41:23.744
SOME OF THE WONDERFUL THINGS THE

01:41:23.811 --> 01:41:24.945
DAIRY INDUSTRY DOING.

01:41:25.012 --> 01:41:26.780
I'M GLAD AUDUBON BROUGHT UP THE

01:41:26.847 --> 01:41:28.415
WORK WE'VE DONE ON TRI COLORED

01:41:28.482 --> 01:41:29.616
BLACKBIRD SO WE'RE JUST GETTING

01:41:29.683 --> 01:41:30.918

01:41:30.984 --> 01:41:31.952
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU.

GOOD PRESENTATION QUESTIONS THE

01:41:36.323 --> 01:41:36.523
COMMITTEE.

01:41:36.590 --> 01:41:39.193
I KNEW --

01:41:39.259 --> 01:41:41.161
I'VE TAKEN A GREAT INTEREST IN

01:41:41.228 --> 01:41:44.698
THIS DIET DAIRY DIE JUST OR THE

01:41:44.765 --> 01:41:45.999
LAGOONS.

01:41:46.066 --> 01:41:49.703
PARA METHANE REDUCTION --

01:41:49.770 --> 01:41:51.205
THINKS I'M INTRIGUED BY YOUR

01:41:51.271 --> 01:41:52.639
PRESENTATION AND I'M INTRIGUED

01:41:52.706 --> 01:41:54.641
ABOUT THE WHOLE INDUSTRY AS A

01:41:54.708 --> 01:41:55.809
WHOLE OF LIKE.

01:41:55.876 --> 01:41:57.211
WHO'S DOING WHAT WHAT'S DOING

01:41:57.277 --> 01:41:57.978
NEW.

01:41:58.045 --> 01:41:58.846
AND SO EVERY NOW AND THEN I

01:41:58.912 --> 01:42:00.948
THINK TO MYSELF SO --

01:42:01.014 --> 01:42:03.183
THERE ARE.

01:42:03.250 --> 01:42:04.751
AND YOU BY GNOME BUT FROM.

01:42:04.818 --> 01:42:06.019
PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD THAT

01:42:06.086 --> 01:42:07.321
ARE DOING THIS VERY SUCCESSFULLY

01:42:07.387 --> 01:42:08.555
ALREADY.

01:42:08.622 --> 01:42:10.424
ARMY RECREATING THE WHEEL HERE

01:42:10.491 --> 01:42:11.825
ARE IS ARE WE TAKING SOME OF THE

01:42:11.892 --> 01:42:14.228
TECHNOLOGIES AND EDUCATION THAT

01:42:14.294 --> 01:42:16.163
WE'RE GETTING FROM OTHER --

01:42:16.230 --> 01:42:19.099
COUNTRIES INTO CONSIDERATION AND

01:42:19.166 --> 01:42:21.368
DO WE HAVE TEST PLOTS THAT WE

01:42:21.435 --> 01:42:23.003
CAN SEE SOME OF THAT ACTUALLY.

01:42:23.070 --> 01:42:25.873
WORKING NOW --

01:42:25.939 --> 01:42:27.374
YEAH THERE'S NO QUESTION WE'VE

01:42:27.441 --> 01:42:28.342
LOOKED TO THE REST OF THE

01:42:28.408 --> 01:42:29.142
COUNTRY --

01:42:29.209 --> 01:42:30.177
OUR DAIRY INDUSTRY IS A LITTLE

01:42:30.244 --> 01:42:31.612
DIFFERENT EVEN THAN THE REST OF

01:42:31.678 --> 01:42:33.447
THE NATION IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE

01:42:33.514 --> 01:42:35.249
WE HAVE A LOT OF LAGOONS.

01:42:35.315 --> 01:42:36.450
AND THE GREEN DYE JESTERS ARE

01:42:36.517 --> 01:42:38.352
NOT VERY COMMON IN OTHER PARTS

01:42:38.418 --> 01:42:39.620
OF THE COUNTRY CERTAINLY NOT

01:42:39.686 --> 01:42:41.255
OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD.

01:42:41.321 --> 01:42:42.389
OF AGAINST DON'T WORK VERY LONG

01:42:42.456 --> 01:42:44.057
WISCONSIN IN THE WINTERTIME SO

01:42:44.124 --> 01:42:45.459
THEY'VE THEY'VE TENDED TO STAY

01:42:45.526 --> 01:42:46.927
WAY THEY TURNED ICE SKATING

01:42:46.994 --> 01:42:48.495
RINKS THOUGH --

01:42:48.562 --> 01:42:50.464
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT SO WE HAVE

01:42:50.531 --> 01:42:52.933
SORT OF TAKEN THOSE TECHNOLOGIES

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.369
AND ADAPTED THEM TO CALIFORNIA.

01:42:55.435 --> 01:42:56.970
AND SO WE'RE SEEING A LOT MORE

01:42:57.037 --> 01:42:58.939
OF THE COVERED THE GOON VARIETY

01:42:59.006 --> 01:43:00.874
HERE THAN WE'VE SEEN ALTHOUGH

01:43:00.941 --> 01:43:02.576
THERE ARE A FEW PLUG FLOW DIE

01:43:02.643 --> 01:43:04.611
JESTERS OPERATING IN CALIFORNIA.

01:43:04.678 --> 01:43:05.212
MORE BEING PROPOSED AND THERE

01:43:05.279 --> 01:43:08.382
HAVE.

01:43:08.448 --> 01:43:09.016
THEY ARE WIDELY USED IN GERMANY

01:43:09.082 --> 01:43:12.386
AND THOSE HAVE NOT PERFORMED

01:43:12.452 --> 01:43:13.320
PARTICULARLY WELL HERE IN

01:43:13.387 --> 01:43:15.222
CALIFORNIA BUT THAT'S NOT TO SAY

01:43:15.289 --> 01:43:17.024
THAT THEY CAN'T BE FURTHER

01:43:17.090 --> 01:43:18.458
ADAPTED AND REMOVED.

01:43:18.525 --> 01:43:20.627
WERE WERE TECHNOLOGY AGNOSTIC AS

01:43:20.694 --> 01:43:22.763
AN INDUSTRY WE SUPPORT BOTH THE

01:43:22.829 --> 01:43:24.665
AND PROGRAM AND THE DIGESTIVE

01:43:24.731 --> 01:43:25.265
PROGRAM BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH

01:43:25.332 --> 01:43:26.833
GOING TO BE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT

01:43:26.900 --> 01:43:28.702
NOT EVERY DAIRY CAN INSTALL AND

01:43:28.769 --> 01:43:29.436
I JUST HER.

01:43:29.503 --> 01:43:30.804
NOR GROUP WHO WOULD WE WANT

01:43:30.871 --> 01:43:33.273
EVERY DAIRY TO PUT IT DIE JESTER

01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:34.408
AND SO THE ALTERNATIVE PROGRAMS.

01:43:34.474 --> 01:43:36.176
BECOME EQUALLY IMPORTANT BUT WE

01:43:36.243 --> 01:43:38.612
ARE DOING A LOT OF RESEARCH.

01:43:38.679 --> 01:43:40.280
ON THE CAMPSITE IN PARTICULAR

01:43:40.347 --> 01:43:41.648
THE ALTERNATE MINORE MANAGEMENT

01:43:41.715 --> 01:43:43.450
PRACTICE SIDE BECAUSE THAT IS

01:43:43.517 --> 01:43:44.718
WHERE WE THINK THERE CAN BE A

01:43:44.785 --> 01:43:46.887
LOT OF ADDITIONAL ADVANCEMENTS.

01:43:46.954 --> 01:43:48.088
THE DIGEST HER STUFF'S PRETTY

01:43:48.155 --> 01:43:49.790
SOLIDLY RESEARCH WE'VE GOT A

01:43:49.856 --> 01:43:52.693
PROTOCOL WE CAN GENERATE CREDITS.

01:43:52.759 --> 01:43:54.828
WE WANT TO GET THE APP PROGRAM

01:43:54.895 --> 01:43:55.462
TO THE SAME LEVEL WHERE WE CAN

01:43:55.529 --> 01:43:56.263
GENERATE.

01:43:56.330 --> 01:43:58.165
GREENHOUSE GAS CREDIT REDUCTION

01:43:58.231 --> 01:43:59.733
SO THAT FARMERS CAN GET SOME.

01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:02.202
REVENUE FROM THOSE PROJECTS.

01:44:02.269 --> 01:44:03.170
DIE JESTER FOR BIDE REVENUE

01:44:03.236 --> 01:44:05.839
WHICH MAKES THEM VERY COST

01:44:05.906 --> 01:44:06.139
EFFECTIVE.

01:44:06.206 --> 01:44:08.542
THE AND PROGRAMS ARE ALSO ARE

01:44:08.609 --> 01:44:10.677
PROJECTS ARE ALSO COST EFFECTIVE

01:44:10.744 --> 01:44:11.612
BUT THEY DON'T HAVE A REVENUE

01:44:11.678 --> 01:44:13.647
STREAM GENERALLY ASSOCIATED WITH

01:44:13.714 --> 01:44:15.415
THEM SO WE CAN DO THE RESEARCH.

01:44:15.482 --> 01:44:16.850
DOCUMENT THE REDUCTIONS THAT

01:44:16.917 --> 01:44:18.352
THEY CAN ACHIEVE GET PROTOCOLS

01:44:18.418 --> 01:44:19.753
DEVELOPED LIKE WE HAVE FOR THE

01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:21.188
DAIRY INDUSTRY.

01:44:21.254 --> 01:44:22.756
OR THE RICE INDUSTRY HAS FOR I

01:44:22.823 --> 01:44:24.191
THINK THE ONLY TWO IN

01:44:24.257 --> 01:44:25.492
AGRICULTURE THAT HAVE PROTOCOLS.

01:44:25.559 --> 01:44:27.828
THEN WE CAN GET CREDITS FOR

01:44:27.894 --> 01:44:29.529
THOSE AND GENERATE REVENUE YOU.

01:44:29.596 --> 01:44:31.832
SO WELL ENCOURAGING THE AIR

01:44:31.898 --> 01:44:33.133
RESOURCES BOARD TO WORK WITH US

01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:34.267
TO GET THOSE BUTTON PLACE

01:44:34.334 --> 01:44:36.036
QUICKLY COULD GO A LONG WAY.

01:44:36.103 --> 01:44:37.471
AND REDUCED HIM TO SOME DEGREE

01:44:37.537 --> 01:44:40.574
THAN.

01:44:40.641 --> 01:44:43.143
SO WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING ACROSS

01:44:43.210 --> 01:44:44.745
THE BOARD WE'D TRY NOT TO

01:44:44.811 --> 01:44:46.380
DUPLICATE EFFORTS BUT WE DO TRY

01:44:46.446 --> 01:44:46.980
TO LEARN FROM WHAT'S BEEN DONE

01:44:47.047 --> 01:44:49.016
ELSEWHERE.

01:44:49.082 --> 01:44:50.050
DO YOU HAVE TO BE PUBLISHED TO

01:44:50.117 --> 01:44:51.952
GET TO DO SOME OF THIS WORK

01:44:52.019 --> 01:44:52.252
[inaudible]

01:44:52.319 --> 01:44:53.787
SOME.

01:44:53.854 --> 01:44:54.888
AND THAT'S WHERE I'M HITTING A

01:44:54.955 --> 01:44:56.523
WALL.

01:44:56.590 --> 01:44:58.125

BE USED IN CALIFORNIA.

01:45:02.529 --> 01:45:04.064
HOMEBREW.

01:45:04.131 --> 01:45:05.399
NO I DON'TKNOW THAT DID TO ITS

01:45:05.465 --> 01:45:07.100
REALLY STOPPING TECHNOLOGIES

01:45:07.167 --> 01:45:08.535
FROM BEING USED I THINK THE

01:45:08.602 --> 01:45:10.637
RESEARCH TO BE CONSIDERED VALID

01:45:10.704 --> 01:45:12.272
BY A OR B. AND OTHERS.

01:45:12.339 --> 01:45:13.874
NEEDS TO BE PUBLISHED WHICH IS

01:45:13.940 --> 01:45:14.641
WHY WE'RE WAITING FOR THE

01:45:14.708 --> 01:45:16.510
ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND STUDY

01:45:16.576 --> 01:45:17.944
TO BE PUBLISHED.

01:45:18.011 --> 01:45:19.146

AB ABOUT AS WELL AS AN INDUSTRY

01:45:37.831 --> 01:45:39.266
CAN WORK WITH THE AIR RESOURCES

01:45:39.332 --> 01:45:40.867
BOARD WE DON'T SEE EYE TO EYE

01:45:40.934 --> 01:45:42.069
AND EVERYTHING NOT BY A LONG

01:45:42.135 --> 01:45:43.870
SHOT BUT THEY'RE WORKING VERY

01:45:43.937 --> 01:45:46.206
COOPERATIVELY WITH THIS INDUSTRY.

01:45:46.273 --> 01:45:46.840
TO HELP US ACHIEVE THE

01:45:46.907 --> 01:45:49.876

CAREFULLY SO THAT THEY'RE

01:46:07.761 --> 01:46:09.229
ACCURATE WHICH IS WHY WERE OUT

01:46:09.296 --> 01:46:10.297
DOING THE RESEARCH TO VERIFY THE

01:46:10.363 --> 01:46:12.199
REDUCTION.

01:46:12.265 --> 01:46:13.133
YOU KNOW WE KNOW WHAT DIE

01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:14.868
JESTERS WHAT THEY CAN ACHIEVE IN

01:46:14.935 --> 01:46:15.802
TERMS OF REDUCTIONS IT'S WELL

01:46:15.869 --> 01:46:18.438
DOCUMENTED HAS FOR YEARS WERE

01:46:18.505 --> 01:46:19.740
NOT QUITE THERE BUT WE'LL BE

01:46:19.806 --> 01:46:20.907
THERE IN A COUPLE OF YEARS IN

01:46:20.974 --> 01:46:22.509
THE INDUSTRY IS PUTTING UP A LOT

01:46:22.576 --> 01:46:23.410
OF THAT MONEY.

01:46:23.477 --> 01:46:24.911
AND THE STATE'S MATCHING THAT

01:46:24.978 --> 01:46:26.279
WITH US IN WORKING WITH US TO

01:46:26.346 --> 01:46:27.914
GET THOSE REDUCTIONS.

01:46:27.981 --> 01:46:29.349
ARE YOU KNOW HAVE PART OF THOSE

01:46:29.416 --> 01:46:30.951
OF RECENT COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT

01:46:31.017 --> 01:46:32.686
WE HAVE WITH THEIR BE IS THERE

01:46:32.753 --> 01:46:33.553
GOING TO BE PUTTING SOME VERY

01:46:33.620 --> 01:46:35.188
SOPHISTICATED TOWERS.

01:46:35.255 --> 01:46:36.623
IN SOME OF THESE DAIRIES WERE

01:46:36.690 --> 01:46:38.091
INSTALLING THESE ALTERNATE NOR

01:46:38.158 --> 01:46:39.659
MANAGEMENT PRACTICES SO WE CAN

01:46:39.726 --> 01:46:41.762
GAIN A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF

01:46:41.828 --> 01:46:42.829
THE EMISSIONS PROFILE WE'RE NOT

01:46:42.896 --> 01:46:44.498
JUST LOOK AT NOTHING.

01:46:44.564 --> 01:46:45.899
WE WANT TO KNOW ARE THERE OTHER

01:46:45.966 --> 01:46:47.467
TRADE OFFS OTHER BENEFITS WE

01:46:47.534 --> 01:46:48.702
KNOW THE DIGEST YEARS PROVIDE

01:46:48.769 --> 01:46:50.170
TREMENDOUS OTHER.

01:46:50.237 --> 01:46:52.405
BENEFITS HOW REDUCING OTHER

01:46:52.472 --> 01:46:54.307
POLLUTANTS ON THE DAIRY WE WANT

01:46:54.374 --> 01:46:55.442
TO CHECK TO MAKE SURE THE SAME

01:46:55.509 --> 01:46:56.510
THINGS OCCURRING WITH THESE

01:46:56.576 --> 01:46:57.878
ALTERNATIVE PRACTICES.

01:46:57.944 --> 01:47:00.147
AND DOCUMENTS AND THAT'S HOW WE

01:47:00.213 --> 01:47:01.882
MAKE THE CASE.

01:47:01.948 --> 01:47:02.883
FOR BETTER MAKE THE CASE FOR

01:47:02.949 --> 01:47:05.051
MORE MONEY GOING FORWARD SO.

01:47:05.118 --> 01:47:06.620
YOU HAVE GOT AYE MY MIND IS LIKE

01:47:06.686 --> 01:47:08.188
TO GET STUFF DONE NOW.

01:47:08.255 --> 01:47:09.823
AND IT'S FRUSTRATING BECAUSE THE

01:47:09.890 --> 01:47:11.391

01:47:34.781 --> 01:47:36.550
THIS LEGISLATURE HAS STOOD UP

01:47:36.616 --> 01:47:37.651
FOR US AND WE APPRECIATE THAT

01:47:37.717 --> 01:47:39.486
THAT TO GET THE FUNDING.

01:47:40.387 --> 01:47:43.423
IT'S GOOD BANG FOR THE BUCK AND

01:47:43.490 --> 01:47:44.791

GOING TO GO THROUGH THAT

01:47:50.997 --> 01:47:52.098
TRANSITION AND SO.

IS WORKING CLOSELY WITH US.

01:49:16.883 --> 01:49:18.652
AND LOOKING AGES OF SORTS OF

01:49:18.718 --> 01:49:20.453
OPPORTUNITIES HOW THE PLANET

01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:22.489

THERE THE PROFESSIONALS THEY'RE

01:49:27.761 --> 01:49:29.462
GONNA TAKE THAT TO THE NEXT

01:49:29.529 --> 01:49:30.964
LEVEL BUT THERE IS A MARKET FOR

01:49:31.031 --> 01:49:32.132
THERE'S NO QUESTION

01:49:32.198 --> 01:49:34.768
AND PEOPLE ARE WHAT PRODUCTS

01:49:34.834 --> 01:49:35.902
THAT ARE SUSTAINABLE.

01:49:35.969 --> 01:49:37.370
AND I YOU KNOW WE THINK WE'VE

01:49:37.437 --> 01:49:38.471
GOT A MUCH MORE SUSTAINABLE

01:49:38.538 --> 01:49:39.739
DAIRY INDUSTRY HERE IN

01:49:39.806 --> 01:49:41.107
CALIFORNIA --

BUT WHEN YOU START TO LOOK AT

01:49:44.544 --> 01:49:46.046
CALIFORNIA VERSUS THE REST OF

01:49:46.112 --> 01:49:47.514
THE WORLD IT'S LIGHT YEARS IN

01:49:47.580 --> 01:49:49.182
TERMS OF OUR OUR CARBON

01:49:49.249 --> 01:49:50.850
FOOTPRINT IN PARTICULAR FOR

EVERY GALLON ENOUGH PRODUCE.

01:49:52.686 --> 01:49:53.887
RIGHT THOUGH THAT'S WHAT THAT'S

01:49:53.954 --> 01:49:55.655
MY THOUGHT IS THAT IF THERE'S A

01:49:55.722 --> 01:49:57.424
WAY TO MARKET IT'S IT'S SO.

01:49:57.490 --> 01:49:58.925
MANY PEOPLE WILL BE WILLING TO

01:49:58.992 --> 01:50:00.694
PAY FOR IT AND WOULD APPRECIATE

01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:03.330
KNOWING THAT THAT THAT PRODUCT

01:50:03.396 --> 01:50:05.565
HAS IT HAS A VALUE.

TRACTOR AREA WAS HAVING THOSE

01:50:44.537 --> 01:50:46.106
RESOURCES AVAILABLE THROUGH THE

01:50:46.172 --> 01:50:47.440
AIR BOARD AND THE MORE THAT WE

01:50:48.708 --> 01:50:50.910
CREATE THOSE.

01:50:50.977 --> 01:50:53.747
OPPORTUNITIES I THINK THE BETTER.

01:50:53.813 --> 01:50:55.048
THE MORE THAT WE CAN SAY THAT

01:50:55.115 --> 01:50:56.383
MIGHT YOU KNOW MIGHT MY INTEREST

01:50:56.449 --> 01:50:57.717
IS MAKING SURE THAT AGRICULTURE

01:50:57.784 --> 01:50:59.519
IS SUSTAINABLE AND THAT IT IT IS.

01:50:59.586 --> 01:51:00.720

ABLE TO CONTINUE IN THE STATE

01:51:04.691 --> 01:51:07.560

SINK IN.

01:51:20.006 --> 01:51:21.141
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU DO THAT THE

01:51:21.207 --> 01:51:22.809
FIRST TIME PEOPLE THERE'S ALWAYS

01:51:22.876 --> 01:51:25.245
SOMETHING THEY DON'T LIKE BUT

01:51:25.311 --> 01:51:27.113
BUT I THINK THERE'S SOME REAL.

01:51:27.180 --> 01:51:29.382
I'M INTEREST IN THE LEGISLATURE

01:51:29.449 --> 01:51:30.016
LOOKING AT WAYS TO BE ABLE TO

01:51:30.083 --> 01:51:32.652
SUPPORT PERFORMING IN SO THESE

PROGRAMS IN THE THE GREENHOUSE

01:51:34.854 --> 01:51:36.556
GAS REDUCTION FUND.

01:51:36.623 --> 01:51:38.425
ARE ONE POTENTIAL SOURCE WE USE

01:51:38.491 --> 01:51:40.226
TO HAVE THE WILLIAMS WILLIAMSON

01:51:40.293 --> 01:51:41.661
ACT IS ANOTHER --

01:51:41.728 --> 01:51:42.796
WE'RE DOING SOME GREAT LAND

01:51:42.862 --> 01:51:44.664
CONSERVATION --

01:51:44.731 --> 01:51:45.899
WORK AS WELL BUT IT.

01:51:45.965 --> 01:51:46.966
IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THE MORE

01:51:47.033 --> 01:51:48.768
TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX THAT THERE

01:51:48.835 --> 01:51:50.603
ARE THAT THAT IT MAY BE HELPFUL

01:51:50.670 --> 01:51:51.371
AND I'M WONDERING WHAT YOU

01:51:51.438 --> 01:51:52.806
THOUGHT YOU THOUGHT YOU THINK

01:51:52.872 --> 01:51:54.507
THINK ABOUT THAT INCENTIVE SIR.

01:51:54.574 --> 01:51:56.876
TAX CREDITS Y. I THINK --

01:51:56.943 --> 01:51:58.578
THE INCENTIVES OF AN ENORMOUSLY

01:51:58.645 --> 01:52:01.081
POWERFUL IN THAT YOU KNOW.

01:52:01.147 --> 01:52:03.049
CALIFORNIA IS THE LARGEST

01:52:03.116 --> 01:52:05.151
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCING SATAN ON

01:52:05.218 --> 01:52:06.753
A GIVEN THIS ROOM WOULD AGREE

01:52:06.820 --> 01:52:08.088
WITH THAT --

01:52:08.154 --> 01:52:09.889
BUT WE'RE ALSO PROBABLY THE MOST

01:52:09.956 --> 01:52:12.625
ENVIRONMENTALLY AWARE STATE AND

01:52:12.692 --> 01:52:14.394
THERE'S A COST TO THAT.

01:52:14.461 --> 01:52:16.029
AND AND YOU'RE RIGHT WHEN YOUR

01:52:16.096 --> 01:52:17.097
CONCERN IS IS --

01:52:17.163 --> 01:52:18.798
THAT THE SMALL MEDIUM SIZED

01:52:18.865 --> 01:52:20.467
FARMS -- I

01:52:20.533 --> 01:52:21.768
HAVE A TOUGHER TIME WITH THAT

01:52:21.835 --> 01:52:23.169
COST BECAUSE THEY ARE UNABLE TO

01:52:23.236 --> 01:52:25.004
SPREAD IT OUT AND THESE

01:52:25.071 --> 01:52:26.840
INCENTIVE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN A

01:52:26.906 --> 01:52:28.575
VERY HELPFUL --

01:52:28.641 --> 01:52:30.376
AND THAT THE TWO THAT I TALKED

01:52:30.443 --> 01:52:32.412
ABOUT THE TWO STATE PROGRAMS --

01:52:32.479 --> 01:52:34.013
UP I'VE I'VE WORKED WITH HAVE

01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:35.648
BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL PROGRAMS

01:52:35.715 --> 01:52:37.650
AND AS A FARMER MY MY MAIN JOB

01:52:37.717 --> 01:52:40.220
IS FARMING IT'S NOT APPLYING FOR

01:52:40.286 --> 01:52:43.256
PROGRAMS --

01:52:43.323 --> 01:52:45.225
WHEN I APPLY FOR FEDERAL PROGRAM

01:52:45.291 --> 01:52:46.626
THEY CAN BE A VERY DIFFICULT

01:52:46.693 --> 01:52:48.128
PROCESS AND I SPEND A LOT OF

01:52:48.194 --> 01:52:49.329
TIME HAVING TO FILL OUT A LOT OF

01:52:49.395 --> 01:52:52.232
FORUMS AND I HAVE A LOT OF --

01:52:52.298 --> 01:52:53.933
FOLLOW UPS AND AND WHAT NOT KNOW

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:55.435
WHAT WITH THE POWER OF THE STATE

01:52:55.502 --> 01:52:56.803
PROGRAMS --

01:52:56.870 --> 01:52:58.438
THAT I'VE HAD EXPERIENCE WITH

01:52:58.505 --> 01:52:59.873
AND WHY I THINK THEY'VE BEEN SO

01:52:59.939 --> 01:53:02.142
SUCCESSFUL IS THEIR VERY USER

01:53:02.208 --> 01:53:03.309
FRIENDLY --

01:53:03.376 --> 01:53:05.812
CDFA MANAGES --

01:53:05.879 --> 01:53:07.847
THE SWEET PROGRAM AND THAT

01:53:07.914 --> 01:53:09.149
THEY'RE VERY EASY TO WORK WITH

01:53:09.215 --> 01:53:10.416
THEIR VERY STRAIGHT FOR THEY

01:53:10.483 --> 01:53:11.451
HAVE VERY TOUGH --

01:53:11.518 --> 01:53:13.386
STANDARDS THEY WANT YOU TO MEET

01:53:13.453 --> 01:53:15.989
BUT THEY HELP YOU UNDERSTAND --

01:53:16.055 --> 01:53:17.457
HOW YOU CAN WORK TO MEET THOSE

01:53:17.524 --> 01:53:18.958
SO I IT'S IT'S VERY AGGRESSIVE

01:53:19.025 --> 01:53:20.894
IN TRYING TO GET GROWERS ENGAGED

01:53:20.960 --> 01:53:22.929
IN THAT I THINK THAT'S HELPFUL --

01:53:22.996 --> 01:53:26.833
WITH THE TRACTOR REPLACEMENT --

01:53:26.900 --> 01:53:28.368
THERE AGAIN IT IS VERY USER

01:53:28.434 --> 01:53:29.869
FRIENDLY IT'S FOR THE GROWERS

01:53:29.936 --> 01:53:32.038
IT'S VERY SIMPLE MATTER OF GOING

01:53:32.105 --> 01:53:33.740
THROUGH THE APPLICATION PROCESS

01:53:33.806 --> 01:53:34.240
AND THERE'S HELP READILY

01:53:34.307 --> 01:53:35.275
AVAILABLE.

01:53:35.341 --> 01:53:36.743
AND I THINK THAT --

01:53:36.809 --> 01:53:40.747
ALONG WITH THE DRIVE --

01:53:40.813 --> 01:53:43.116
STATEWIDE HAS A BEEN A LARGE

01:53:43.183 --> 01:53:44.884
PART WHY THOSE PROGRAMS AND HAVE

01:53:44.951 --> 01:53:47.820
BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL AND WHY FOR

01:53:47.887 --> 01:53:49.956
FOR MY FARM I FIND THEM --

01:53:50.023 --> 01:53:53.059
VERY HELPFUL JUST BECAUSE AS I'M

01:53:53.126 --> 01:53:55.461
LOOKING AT NEW STANDARDS OR OR

01:53:55.528 --> 01:53:57.597
NEW REGULATIONS ORA EVEN BEFORE

01:53:57.664 --> 01:53:59.499
THEY HAPPEN WILL --

01:53:59.566 --> 01:54:02.035
THEY HELPED ME BE AHEAD OF THE

01:54:02.101 --> 01:54:03.870
CURVE OR MEET THE NEW STANDARDS

01:54:03.937 --> 01:54:05.405
WITHOUT HAVING TO MOVE BASICALLY

01:54:05.471 --> 01:54:07.373
MORTGAGE THE FAR RIGHT.

01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:08.508

IN THEN ALSO ON THE I HAD AN

01:54:13.279 --> 01:54:15.648
OPPORTUNITY.

01:54:15.715 --> 01:54:17.383

JUST AROUND THE TIME AT THE END

01:54:22.889 --> 01:54:24.290
OF THE SEASON --

01:54:24.357 --> 01:54:26.492

PASSED A FARM WHERE --

01:54:37.604 --> 01:54:40.373
BIRDS HAVE BEEN --

01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:41.608
FEEDING I GUESS IS THE BEST WAY

01:54:41.674 --> 01:54:44.877
TO SAY IT FOR AND TO SEE THEM

01:54:44.944 --> 01:54:48.014

I BECOME A REAL A REAL FAN OF OF

01:55:00.526 --> 01:55:02.195
WHAT YOU'RE DOING --

01:55:02.262 --> 01:55:04.097
TO CREATE HABITAT AND TO PROVIDE

01:55:04.163 --> 01:55:05.565
NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE

01:55:05.632 --> 01:55:07.767
SHOREBIRDS AND IS WHEN YOU WERE

01:55:07.834 --> 01:55:09.636
TALKING ABOUT THE THE WATER

01:55:09.702 --> 01:55:12.038
LEAVING THE RICE FIELDS AND

01:55:12.105 --> 01:55:13.873
MOVING MOVING ON DOES ANY OF

01:55:13.940 --> 01:55:15.408
THAT WATER GET.

01:55:15.475 --> 01:55:19.212
FURTHER SOUTH OF OF THE OF THE

01:55:19.279 --> 01:55:20.446
RICE FIELDS --

01:55:20.513 --> 01:55:22.315
ME IN AND I THE REASON I ASK

01:55:22.382 --> 01:55:25.351
THAT IS IS THE SIGNIFICANT AREA

01:55:25.418 --> 01:55:27.053
WHERE THERE IS.

01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:29.022
UP WETLANDS THAT HAS BEEN

01:55:29.088 --> 01:55:32.892
CREATED WITH FARMLAND AND WITH --

01:55:32.959 --> 01:55:34.460
SOME CONSERVATION GROUPS IS AND

01:55:34.527 --> 01:55:36.396
IS IN MISTER GRAY'S --

01:55:36.462 --> 01:55:38.031
DISTRICT WHICH IS ROB RIGHT

01:55:38.097 --> 01:55:40.033
THERE OFF OF THE NINETY NINE

01:55:40.099 --> 01:55:40.700
FREEWAY.

01:55:40.767 --> 01:55:42.635
ACTUALLY IT'S THAT IT'S A FIVE

01:55:42.702 --> 01:55:44.370
FREE WEIGHT OVER TO THE NINE

01:55:44.437 --> 01:55:47.140
NINE FREEWAY AND THAT THAT --

01:55:47.206 --> 01:55:48.941
PROPERTY IS JUST INCREDIBLE AND

01:55:49.008 --> 01:55:51.678
ITS THOUSANDS OF ACRES AND A BIG

01:55:51.744 --> 01:55:53.880
CHALLENGES HAVING.

01:55:53.946 --> 01:55:55.515
IT BE PARTICULARLY IN THAT AREA

01:55:55.581 --> 01:55:56.949
IT'S HAVING ENOUGH WATER

01:55:57.016 --> 01:55:58.518
AVAILABLE TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THE

01:55:58.584 --> 01:56:00.687
DIFFERENT LEVELS OF WATER IN THE

01:56:00.753 --> 01:56:02.622
DIFFERENT FIELDS FOR THE

01:56:02.689 --> 01:56:04.424
DIFFERENT SPECIES AND SO.

01:56:04.490 --> 01:56:05.925
THE MORE THAT WE CAN WORK OUT

01:56:05.992 --> 01:56:07.694
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BE

01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:09.929
ABLE. TO TO TO USE THE WATER

01:56:09.996 --> 01:56:11.698
THAT WE HAVE AS MANY TIMES AS

01:56:11.764 --> 01:56:14.067
POSSIBLE FOR AS MANY USES.

01:56:14.133 --> 01:56:16.736
AS POSSIBLE IN IT WHICH IS I

01:56:16.803 --> 01:56:18.738
THINK TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT AND

01:56:18.805 --> 01:56:20.606
AND IF YEAR IF THERE IS RESEARCH

01:56:20.673 --> 01:56:21.774
THAT'S BEING DONE IN TERMS OF

01:56:21.841 --> 01:56:25.645
THE KINDS OF OF OF PLANT

01:56:25.712 --> 01:56:27.347
MATERIALS.

01:56:27.413 --> 01:56:30.049
THAT ARE THAT MIGHT BE GOOD.

01:56:30.116 --> 01:56:31.517
TO ALSO TAKE --

01:56:31.584 --> 01:56:33.486
FURTHER SOUTH NEAR GROWING RICE

01:56:33.553 --> 01:56:35.655
AND MAYBE IT'S SEEDING SOME RICE

01:56:35.722 --> 01:56:36.689
IN THIS PARTICULAR REGION JUST

01:56:36.756 --> 01:56:38.791
SO THAT THERE'S A VARIETY OF

01:56:38.858 --> 01:56:40.059
DIFFERENT --

01:56:40.126 --> 01:56:41.928
OPPORTUNITIES FOR HERB FOR BIRDS

01:56:41.994 --> 01:56:44.130
TO BE ABLE TO MOVE UP AND DOWN --

01:56:44.197 --> 01:56:44.931
THAT.

01:56:44.997 --> 01:56:46.866
CALIFORNIA I THINK THE MORE

01:56:46.933 --> 01:56:47.700
INFORMATION WE HAVE THE MORE

01:56:47.767 --> 01:56:49.302
DATA WE HAVE THE MORE SCIENCE WE

01:56:49.369 --> 01:56:50.536
USE I THINK.

01:56:50.603 --> 01:56:52.438
WOULD BE TREMENDOUSLY THREAT

01:56:52.505 --> 01:56:54.006

01:56:55.575 --> 01:56:57.677
BOB TO THOSE WETLANDS AND IT'S

01:56:57.744 --> 01:57:00.346
IT'S INCREDIBLE THAT VARIETY OF

01:57:00.413 --> 01:57:02.048
BIRDS THAT YOU SEE AND THAT

01:57:02.115 --> 01:57:03.182
THOSE ARE DEBT CLUBS THAT ARE

01:57:03.249 --> 01:57:04.951
KEEPING THAT THAT GOING SO SURE

01:57:05.017 --> 01:57:06.452
VERY IMPORTANT.

01:57:06.519 --> 01:57:07.186
I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVEA

01:57:07.253 --> 01:57:08.020
QUESTION THERE IN I DON'T KNOW

KIND OF SET THE STAGE IN A SENSE --

02:00:46.238 --> 02:00:47.506
FOR A DIALOGUE THAT I'M HOPING

02:00:47.573 --> 02:00:49.442
THAT WE CAN HAVE IN THIS IN THIS

02:00:49.508 --> 02:00:51.177
SESSION AND TALKING ABOUT

02:00:51.243 --> 02:00:52.478
WORKING LANDSCAPES AND IS THAT

02:00:52.545 --> 02:00:54.146
IT'S A TERM THAT'S THAT WE USE.

02:00:54.213 --> 02:00:56.682
AND IT'S ALL FOR MORE RELEVANT

02:00:56.749 --> 02:00:59.485
IN A HOW DO WE KEEP OUR

02:00:59.552 --> 02:01:01.187
LANDSCAPES WORKING WHEN I THINK

02:01:01.253 --> 02:01:02.588
ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S WORKING

02:01:02.655 --> 02:01:04.890
LANDSCAPES THE INCLUDE FARMLAND.

02:01:04.957 --> 02:01:07.026
RANCHES RANGELANDS FOREST

02:01:07.093 --> 02:01:09.395
WETLANDS MINES WATER BODIES AND

02:01:09.462 --> 02:01:10.997
OTHER NATURAL RESOURCE LANCE FOR

02:01:11.063 --> 02:01:12.999
BOTH PRIVATE AND PUBLIC.

02:01:13.065 --> 02:01:15.801
THEY BENEFIT US FROM CLEAN WATER

02:01:15.868 --> 02:01:17.069
AND NUTRITIOUS FOOD TO CLIMATE

02:01:17.136 --> 02:01:18.871
STABILITY AND OUTDOOR RECREATION

02:01:18.938 --> 02:01:20.239
AND THE PROVIDES ESSENTIAL

02:01:20.306 --> 02:01:22.041
BENEFITS FOR OUR ECONOMY OUR

02:01:22.108 --> 02:01:23.743
HEALTH IN THE QUALITY OF LIFE.

02:01:23.809 --> 02:01:25.444
AND WE'VE HEARD ABOUT SOME OF

02:01:25.511 --> 02:01:27.113
THOSE PROGRAMS ARE CROSSED ALL

02:01:27.179 --> 02:01:28.381
ASPECTS OF AGRICULTURE THIS

02:01:28.447 --> 02:01:30.149
AFTERNOON.

02:01:30.216 --> 02:01:31.484
AND HE'S ECOSYSTEM SERVICES ARE

02:01:31.550 --> 02:01:32.985
OFTEN TAKEN FOR GRANTED AND I

02:01:33.052 --> 02:01:34.654
THINK WHAT WE WE FIND IS THAT

02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:36.956
AGRICULTURE CAN BE VERY SILO.

02:01:37.023 --> 02:01:38.224
AND THEY ARE THEY'RE VERY

02:01:38.290 --> 02:01:39.392
COMFORTABLE WITH WHAT THEY

02:01:39.458 --> 02:01:41.160
PROVIDE AND THEY'RE VERY PROUD

02:01:41.227 --> 02:01:43.095
AS YOU HEARD JUST BEFORE ME ON

02:01:43.162 --> 02:01:44.997
THAT ON THE SUCCESS STORIES THAT

02:01:45.064 --> 02:01:45.297
THEY HAVE.

02:01:45.364 --> 02:01:46.866
BUT I THINK THE PUBLIC DOESN'T

02:01:46.932 --> 02:01:48.668
HEAR THESE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES I

02:01:48.734 --> 02:01:49.935
THINK WHEN THEY THINK ABOUT

02:01:50.002 --> 02:01:50.503
AGRICULTURE THEY THINK ABOUT

02:01:50.569 --> 02:01:51.303
FOOD.

02:01:51.370 --> 02:01:52.505
THEY THINK ABOUT THE THE WATER

02:01:52.571 --> 02:01:53.906
THAT WE'RE USING TO GROW THAT

02:01:53.973 --> 02:01:55.675
FOOD.

02:01:55.741 --> 02:01:56.876
AND THEY'RE QUESTIONING HOW

02:01:56.942 --> 02:01:58.511
WE'RE GROWING THAT FOOD IS IT IS

02:01:58.577 --> 02:01:59.812
IT SUSTAINABLE IS THAT ORGANIC

02:01:59.879 --> 02:02:01.113
IS A SMALL SCALE IS AT LARGE

02:02:01.180 --> 02:02:01.881
SCALE.

02:02:01.947 --> 02:02:03.349
THEY DON'T THINK ABOUT THAT THE

02:02:03.416 --> 02:02:04.917
CROSS SECTION OF ECOSYSTEM

02:02:04.984 --> 02:02:06.719
SERVICES THAT THESE WORKING A

02:02:06.786 --> 02:02:08.254
LANDSCAPES PROVIDE.

02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:10.089
AND THERE ARE WILL BECAUSE ARE

02:02:10.156 --> 02:02:11.424
TAKEN FOR GRANTED THERE'S A

02:02:11.490 --> 02:02:12.324
MARKET FIRE THAT HITS

02:02:12.391 --> 02:02:13.559
PARTICULARLY HARD IN THE RURAL

02:02:13.626 --> 02:02:14.827
AREAS.

02:02:14.894 --> 02:02:16.595
AND SO A STRONGER FRAMEWORK FOR

02:02:16.662 --> 02:02:18.531
MAPPING VALUE IN INVESTING

02:02:18.597 --> 02:02:20.366
ECOSYSTEM SERVICES CAN ENSURE

02:02:20.433 --> 02:02:21.333
THOSE WHO MANAGE THESE

02:02:21.400 --> 02:02:22.902
CALIFORNIA WORKING LANDS OR

02:02:22.968 --> 02:02:24.704
FARMERS AND RANCHERS WILL

02:02:24.770 --> 02:02:26.472
BENEFIT FROM STEWARDING THEM.

02:02:26.539 --> 02:02:27.473
SO I WANT TO TALK TO YOU TODAY

02:02:27.540 --> 02:02:29.809
ABOUT SOME GOING FORWARD AND HOW

02:02:29.875 --> 02:02:31.577
WE CAN.

02:02:31.644 --> 02:02:34.113
REALLY A SASS AND AND CHAMPION

02:02:34.180 --> 02:02:36.782
WHAT AGRICULTURE IS DOING RIGHT.

02:02:36.849 --> 02:02:38.851
AND I THINK WHEN WE THINK ABOUT.

02:02:38.918 --> 02:02:40.720
ECOSYSTEM SERVICES AND AGAIN

02:02:40.786 --> 02:02:41.987
UNFORTUNATE THEIR SENSE TO BE A

02:02:42.054 --> 02:02:43.055
LOT OF JARGON WORDS WITH

02:02:43.122 --> 02:02:44.957
ECOSYSTEM SERVICES BUT IT'S THE

02:02:45.024 --> 02:02:46.258
WAY THAT NATURE PROVIDES FOR THE

02:02:46.325 --> 02:02:47.860
WELL BEING OF PEOPLE.

02:02:47.927 --> 02:02:49.562
INCLUDES A BIOLOGICAL NECESSITY

02:02:49.628 --> 02:02:50.763
SO WE'VE TALKED ABOUT CLEAN

02:02:50.830 --> 02:02:52.031
WATER NUTRITIOUS FOOD IN A

02:02:52.098 --> 02:02:53.632
LIVABLE CLIMATE AS WELL AS

02:02:53.699 --> 02:02:55.401
INDIRECT ECONOMIC BENEFITS SUCH

02:02:55.468 --> 02:02:56.836
AS JOB IN REVENUE.

02:02:56.902 --> 02:02:58.037
CREATED ALONG THE THE FOOD VALUE

02:02:58.104 --> 02:02:59.705
CHAINS.

02:02:59.772 --> 02:03:01.006
MORE BROADLY TO ENCOMPASS

02:03:01.073 --> 02:03:02.475
INTANGIBLE GOODS AND CONTRIBUTE

02:03:02.541 --> 02:03:04.043
TO A HUMAN WELL BEING SUCH AS

02:03:04.110 --> 02:03:05.678
RECREATION ASCETIC INSPIRATION A

02:03:05.745 --> 02:03:08.013
CULTURAL CONNECTION.

02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:09.615
WHAT THEY HAVE IN COMMON IS THAT

02:03:09.682 --> 02:03:10.883
THEY DEPEND ON NATURAL CAPITAL

02:03:10.950 --> 02:03:12.451
OR IN OTHER WORDS GENERATED OF

02:03:12.518 --> 02:03:13.519
CAPITAL?

02:03:13.586 --> 02:03:15.621
UP ABILITIES OF NATURAL SYSTEMS

02:03:15.688 --> 02:03:17.823
OR WORKING LANCE SO WHEN YOU

02:03:17.890 --> 02:03:19.558
THINK ABOUT THE MILLENNIAL.

02:03:19.625 --> 02:03:20.960
ECOSYSTEM SERVICES IT THERE'S A

02:03:21.026 --> 02:03:24.163
LOT OF WORDS BUT WHEN YOU BOIL

02:03:24.230 --> 02:03:25.264
IT DOWN THERE'S LIKE

02:03:25.331 --> 02:03:26.966
PROVISIONING OR WATER.

02:03:27.032 --> 02:03:28.567
SO THE PROVISIONING SERVICES SO

02:03:28.634 --> 02:03:30.703
WHAT DO THESE AGRICULTURAL LANDS

02:03:30.770 --> 02:03:31.804
PROVIDE.

02:03:31.871 --> 02:03:33.372
AND SO WHAT I'M BUT GOING

02:03:33.439 --> 02:03:34.673
FORWARD WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS

02:03:34.740 --> 02:03:36.375
START DOCUMENTING THOSE SUCCESS

02:03:36.442 --> 02:03:37.910
STORIES AND LOOKING AT CASE

02:03:37.977 --> 02:03:40.146
STUDIES AND ASKING OURSELVES YOU

02:03:40.212 --> 02:03:42.114
KNOW WHERE MIGHT WE FIND SOME

02:03:42.181 --> 02:03:44.583
WAYS TO HIGHLIGHT THESE.

02:03:44.650 --> 02:03:47.253
AND TO INCENTIVIZE THESE FOR OUR

02:03:47.319 --> 02:03:48.087
FOLKS THAT ARE MANAGING THOSE

02:03:48.154 --> 02:03:50.055
LANDS SOME YOU'RE VERY FAMILIAR

02:03:50.122 --> 02:03:52.057
WITH THAT THIS IS THE STORY OF

02:03:52.124 --> 02:03:53.359
NEW YORK CITY.

02:03:53.425 --> 02:03:56.128
WHERE THEY HAD TO TO LOOK AT

02:03:56.195 --> 02:03:57.630
APPLY A WATER SOURCE TO ALL THE

02:03:57.696 --> 02:03:58.330
PEOPLE?

02:03:58.397 --> 02:04:00.533
AND SO THEY LOOKED AT NINETEEN

02:04:00.599 --> 02:04:01.467
HUNDRED SQUARE MILES BETWEEN AT

02:04:01.534 --> 02:04:03.269
THE CATSKILLS IN THE DELAWARE

02:04:03.335 --> 02:04:03.869
WATERSHEDS IN UPPER STATE NEW

02:04:03.936 --> 02:04:04.470
YORK [inaudible]

02:04:04.537 --> 02:04:07.339
AND THEY INTO AND THEY CREATED

02:04:07.406 --> 02:04:08.440
ONE OF THE LARGEST ENGINEERED

02:04:08.507 --> 02:04:09.608
WATER SYSTEMS IN THE UNITED

02:04:09.675 --> 02:04:10.943
STATES.

02:04:11.010 --> 02:04:12.077
SO THEY WORKED WITH THE PRIVATE

02:04:12.144 --> 02:04:15.681
LAND OWNERS. TO HELP THEM

02:04:15.748 --> 02:04:16.582
IMPLEMENT SOME OF THESE

02:04:16.649 --> 02:04:17.883
MANAGEMENT PRACTICES THAT WOULD

02:04:17.950 --> 02:04:19.652
ALLOW FOR THIS LAND THIS WATER

02:04:19.718 --> 02:04:21.053
TO COME THROUGH THE LAND.

02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:22.721
BOTH URBAN AND RURAL RESIDENTS

02:04:22.788 --> 02:04:24.356
BENEFITTED FROM AN AGREEMENT

02:04:24.423 --> 02:04:25.858
THAT INCLUDES LAND ACQUISITION.

02:04:25.925 --> 02:04:27.359
CONSERVATION EASEMENTS AND

02:04:27.426 --> 02:04:28.527
COMPREHENSIVE PLANNING AND

02:04:28.594 --> 02:04:30.329
IMPLEMENTATION OF BEST

02:04:30.396 --> 02:04:31.964
MANAGEMENT PRACTICES FOR FARM.

02:04:32.031 --> 02:04:33.299
A RIGHT PERRY NEARS AND FORESTS

02:04:33.365 --> 02:04:36.001
SO TOOK ALL OF THOSE THINGS SO

02:04:36.068 --> 02:04:37.937
IT'S FROM THE THE FOR WHERE THE

02:04:38.003 --> 02:04:40.639
WATER FALLS. TO THE END USERS.

02:04:40.706 --> 02:04:42.408
SO GOING FORWARD ONE

02:04:42.474 --> 02:04:44.543
RECOMMENDATION COULD BE --

02:04:44.610 --> 02:04:46.412
TO CREATE AND EXPAND MARKETS FOR

02:04:46.478 --> 02:04:48.981
ECOSYSTEM SERVICES AND MIGHT ONE

02:04:49.048 --> 02:04:50.516
OPTION MIGHT BE IN THESE WERE

02:04:50.583 --> 02:04:52.017
INCLUDED IN YOUR PACKETS.

02:04:52.084 --> 02:04:53.853
USE ENHANCED INFRASTRUCTURE

02:04:53.919 --> 02:04:55.721
FINANCING DISTRICTS OR SIMILAR

02:04:55.788 --> 02:04:57.356
MECHANISMS TO CREATE LOCAL OR

02:04:57.423 --> 02:04:59.058
REGIONAL MARKETS FOR NATURAL

02:04:59.124 --> 02:05:01.060
WATER INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:05:01.126 --> 02:05:02.394
SO ITS INCORPORATING THE COST OF

02:05:02.461 --> 02:05:04.430
CONSERVING NATURAL CAPITAL SUCH

02:05:04.496 --> 02:05:06.165
AS AN UPPER WATERSHED FOREST OR

02:05:06.232 --> 02:05:07.266
RIGHT PAIRING CORRIDORS

02:05:07.333 --> 02:05:09.001
INCENTIVIZING THAT FOR

02:05:09.068 --> 02:05:11.437
LANDOWNERS TO IMPROVE THE FORCE

02:05:11.503 --> 02:05:12.938
MANAGEMENT THE RIGHT PAYING

02:05:13.005 --> 02:05:13.572
CORRIDORS.

02:05:13.639 --> 02:05:15.374
AND THEN THE WATER FEES ARE PAID

02:05:15.441 --> 02:05:16.942
BY THE END USERS WHO BENEFIT

02:05:17.009 --> 02:05:18.711
FROM THAT CAPITAL SO HERE'S AN

02:05:18.777 --> 02:05:20.346
OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO THE

02:05:20.412 --> 02:05:21.513
PUBLIC TO SAY.

02:05:21.580 --> 02:05:23.249
YOUR BENEFITING FROM THE WATER

02:05:23.315 --> 02:05:24.550
THAT FALLS ON THESE AGRICULTURE

02:05:24.617 --> 02:05:27.119
LANDS AND FROM THAT STANDPOINT

02:05:27.186 --> 02:05:28.287
WE'RE GOING TO CHARGE YOU EXTOL

02:05:28.354 --> 02:05:30.723
THERE'S YOU KNOW. FOR THE USE OF

02:05:30.789 --> 02:05:32.091
THAT WATER.

02:05:32.157 --> 02:05:33.292
SO THAT MIGHT BE A WAY TO AT

02:05:33.359 --> 02:05:34.727
LEAST START TO MAKE THAT THAT

02:05:34.793 --> 02:05:36.729
CONNECTION THAT PEOPLE --

02:05:36.795 --> 02:05:38.797
DON'T REALLY HAVE THE PUBLIC

02:05:38.864 --> 02:05:40.432
MISSES THE FACT THAT AGRICULTURE

02:05:40.499 --> 02:05:42.401
LANDS ARE PROVIDING THE WATER.

02:05:42.468 --> 02:05:43.969
YOU MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT THE

02:05:44.036 --> 02:05:46.305
VALUE OF OF AGRICULTURE PRODUCTS --

02:05:46.372 --> 02:05:47.640
I THINK ONE INTERESTING

02:05:47.706 --> 02:05:50.643
STATISTIC IS THAT --

02:05:50.709 --> 02:05:51.410
UNIVERSE TO CALIFORNIA'S

02:05:51.477 --> 02:05:53.412
AGRICULTURAL ISSUES CENTER FOUND

02:05:53.479 --> 02:05:54.980
THAT A COMBINED MULTIPLIER

02:05:55.047 --> 02:05:56.515
EFFECT OF TWO POINT.

02:05:56.582 --> 02:05:57.783
SEVEN IN IT FOR EVERY DOLLAR

02:05:57.850 --> 02:05:59.318
FARM GATE THERE WAS ANOTHER

02:05:59.385 --> 02:06:01.553
DOLLAR AND TWENTY SEVEN CENTS

02:06:01.620 --> 02:06:03.122
ADDED TO THE STATE'S ECONOMY.

02:06:03.188 --> 02:06:04.823
SO THAT AGRICULTURE PRODUCTION

02:06:04.890 --> 02:06:06.025
IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE ACT

02:06:06.091 --> 02:06:07.526
OF THE ECONOMY IN THAT DOLLAR

02:06:07.593 --> 02:06:09.995
COMES YOU ADDED JOBS AND AND

02:06:10.062 --> 02:06:11.463
PRODUCTS AND SALES SO IT'S

02:06:11.530 --> 02:06:13.732
HIGHLIGHTING THAT.

02:06:13.799 --> 02:06:15.367
SO WHAT WE HEARD ABOUT TODAY

02:06:15.434 --> 02:06:17.436
ABOUT ANOTHER OPTION MIGHT BE TO

02:06:17.503 --> 02:06:19.939
EXPAND EXISTING MARKETS FOR FARM

02:06:20.005 --> 02:06:21.540
LAND AND RANGE LAND CONSERVATION

02:06:21.607 --> 02:06:22.708
AND WE'VE HEARD ABOUT --

02:06:22.775 --> 02:06:24.209
CERTAIN PROBLEMS PROGRAMS SUCH

02:06:24.276 --> 02:06:26.111
AS SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE LANDS

02:06:26.178 --> 02:06:27.546
CONSERVATION PROGRAM.

02:06:27.613 --> 02:06:28.881
AND THAT'S PROVIDING THOSE

02:06:28.948 --> 02:06:32.017
OPPORTUNITIES.

02:06:32.084 --> 02:06:33.886
BY CONSERVATION EASEMENTS BUT

02:06:33.953 --> 02:06:35.421
WHAT ABOUT IF WE WERE TO NOT

02:06:35.487 --> 02:06:38.057
MORE ALSO ALSO PAY FOR ECOSYSTEM

02:06:38.123 --> 02:06:40.526
SERVICES SO WE HAVE THESE LANDS

02:06:40.592 --> 02:06:43.028
AND WHERE WERE.

02:06:43.095 --> 02:06:44.930
WERE A SETTING THEM ASIDE.

02:06:44.997 --> 02:06:46.198
FOR IN PERPETUITY SO THAT THEY

02:06:46.265 --> 02:06:48.233
CAN'T BE DEVELOPED.

02:06:48.300 --> 02:06:50.302
WHAT IS HAPPENED IS THAT WE'VE

02:06:50.369 --> 02:06:51.103
GOTTEN?

02:06:51.170 --> 02:06:53.072
FIRST SECOND AND NOW THIRD AND

02:06:53.138 --> 02:06:54.306
FOURTH GENERATIONS THAT HAVE

02:06:54.373 --> 02:06:55.174
BEEN INVOLVED IN THOSE

02:06:55.240 --> 02:06:56.742
CONSERVATION EASEMENTS AND THEY

02:06:56.809 --> 02:06:58.077
THE FOURTH GENERATIONS ARE

02:06:58.143 --> 02:06:59.812
STRUGGLING ON HOW HOW DO THEY

02:06:59.878 --> 02:07:01.180
MAKE MONEY OFF THOSE LANDS.

02:07:01.246 --> 02:07:03.682
HOW DO WE HOW DO WE MAKE?

02:07:03.749 --> 02:07:05.684
KEEP THOSE LANDS ACTIVE AND AND

02:07:05.751 --> 02:07:07.319
SO WHAT I'VE DONE IS WE DID SOME

02:07:07.386 --> 02:07:09.588
RESEARCH AND WE ASSESSED IN THIS

02:07:09.655 --> 02:07:10.856
WAS IN MARIN AND SONOMA COUNTY

02:07:10.923 --> 02:07:12.391
ON TWO VERY ESTABLISHED LAND

02:07:12.458 --> 02:07:14.426
TRUST AND ASK THE QUESTION ABOUT.

02:07:14.493 --> 02:07:17.429
WOULD YOU TAKE ONGOING PAYMENTS

02:07:17.496 --> 02:07:19.365
OR WHERE YOU ARE USE SOLID

02:07:19.431 --> 02:07:20.966
WITHOUT MOM SOME WELL

02:07:21.033 --> 02:07:22.601
SURPRISINGLY THE FOLKS THAT TOOK

02:07:22.668 --> 02:07:23.702
THE LUMP SUM OF THE ORIGINAL

02:07:23.769 --> 02:07:24.703
CONSERVATION EASEMENT LIKE

02:07:24.770 --> 02:07:26.271
GRANDPA HE THOUGHT THAT WAS A

02:07:26.338 --> 02:07:27.606
GREAT --

02:07:27.673 --> 02:07:30.209
DEAL BUT GRAND SON OR DAUGHTER

02:07:30.275 --> 02:07:31.477
COMING ON THIRD YOU KNOW TH

02:07:31.543 --> 02:07:33.045
GENERATION IS LOOKING AT HOW DO

02:07:33.112 --> 02:07:34.847
I KEEP THIS LAND GOING I DON'T

02:07:34.913 --> 02:07:36.382
HAVE ANY MONEY ALL I CAN SELL IS

02:07:36.448 --> 02:07:38.283
A COUPLE OF COWS --

02:07:38.350 --> 02:07:39.918
SO HOW DO WE INCENTIVIZE THAT'S

02:07:39.985 --> 02:07:42.354
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS WHAT IF

02:07:42.421 --> 02:07:43.689
THESE CONSERVATION EASEMENT

02:07:43.756 --> 02:07:44.690
PAYMENTS WORD WERE DONE OVER

02:07:44.757 --> 02:07:45.657
TIME.

02:07:45.724 --> 02:07:47.292
GIVING FOLKS THE OPTION TO LOOK

02:07:47.359 --> 02:07:49.762
AT INVESTING THAT MONEY AND THEN

02:07:49.828 --> 02:07:51.597
PAYMENTS OVER TIME THAT IS MORE

02:07:51.663 --> 02:07:52.931
OF A SUCCESSION PLANNING FOR

02:07:52.998 --> 02:07:55.100
FARMING SO THAT KEEPS THEM GOING.

02:07:55.167 --> 02:07:57.436
SO THAT'S THE IDEA THAT.

02:07:57.503 --> 02:07:59.271
SON GRANDSON DAUGHTER

02:07:59.338 --> 02:08:01.540
GRANDDAUGHTER ALL KNOW THAT THEY

02:08:01.607 --> 02:08:03.242
ARE GUARANTEED PAYMENTS FOR A

02:08:03.308 --> 02:08:05.077
EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME SO

02:08:05.144 --> 02:08:06.612
THAT'S GOING TO BE INCENTIVIZING

02:08:06.678 --> 02:08:08.781
THAT AND THEN LOOKING AT OKAY

02:08:08.847 --> 02:08:09.882
YOU'VE SOLDIER DEVELOPMENT

02:08:09.948 --> 02:08:10.382
RIGHTS.

02:08:10.449 --> 02:08:12.684
WHAT IF WE PAGE YOU TO SEQUESTER

02:08:12.751 --> 02:08:14.753
CARBON WHAT IF WE INCREASE THE

02:08:14.820 --> 02:08:16.789
AMOUNT OF CARBON FARMING THAT

02:08:16.855 --> 02:08:18.557
YOU DID WHAT YOU PUT COMPOST ON

02:08:18.624 --> 02:08:19.992
IT FOR THE MOVE TO A MORE?

02:08:20.059 --> 02:08:23.128
PERENNIAL SYSTEM AT IN WOODY

02:08:23.195 --> 02:08:25.130
VEGETATION UP.

02:08:25.197 --> 02:08:27.066
PAIN FOR POLLINATION AYE INC

02:08:27.132 --> 02:08:28.967
INCREASE SEEN THAT CARBON WHAT

02:08:29.034 --> 02:08:31.870
ABOUT IF YOU HAD WATER.

02:08:31.937 --> 02:08:33.172
ATTENTION WHAT IF YOU WERE

02:08:33.238 --> 02:08:35.174
HOLDING WATER IN CAPTURING WATER

02:08:35.240 --> 02:08:36.675
WHAT IF YOU PAID FOR THAT LIKE

02:08:36.742 --> 02:08:38.243
SOME OF THAT --

02:08:38.310 --> 02:08:39.144
PROGRAMS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT

02:08:39.211 --> 02:08:41.113
EARLIER SO IS THIS IDEA THAT

02:08:41.180 --> 02:08:42.815
MAYBE OF SOLDIER DEVELOPMENT

02:08:42.881 --> 02:08:44.416
RIGHTS IN PERPETUITY BUT WHAT

02:08:44.483 --> 02:08:46.118
ABOUT ONGOING PAYMENTS OF OF

02:08:46.185 --> 02:08:47.686
ECOSYSTEM SERVICES.

02:08:47.753 --> 02:08:49.755
SO THAT COULD BE ANOTHER.

02:08:49.822 --> 02:08:51.390
ANOTHER IDEA --

02:08:51.457 --> 02:08:53.158
I THINK IT'S REALLY CRITICAL

02:08:53.225 --> 02:08:54.860
FROM AN EDUCATIONAL STANDPOINT

02:08:54.927 --> 02:08:56.562
AND AND THIS IS WHAT WE'VE DONE

02:08:56.628 --> 02:08:58.564
KIND OF IT WAS A FUN PROJECT BUT

02:08:58.630 --> 02:08:59.865
IT REALLY IS AND PACTUAL.

02:08:59.932 --> 02:09:02.935
IS WHERE. ONE ANOTHER ECOSYSTEM

02:09:03.001 --> 02:09:04.603
SERVICES IS CULTURAL ITS

02:09:04.670 --> 02:09:06.572
RECREATIONAL AND SOUL COLLIGAN I

02:09:06.638 --> 02:09:10.843
LOOKED AT THE REGIONAL PARKS THE

02:09:10.909 --> 02:09:13.178
THE PARKS LETTER GRACED.

02:09:13.245 --> 02:09:14.346
IN -- IN THE

02:09:14.413 --> 02:09:16.014
BAY AREA AND IN IN A NORTHERN

02:09:16.081 --> 02:09:17.149
SONOMA COUNTY.

02:09:17.216 --> 02:09:18.584
AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT PEOPLE

02:09:18.650 --> 02:09:20.185
WERE WANDERING AS OUR HIKING

02:09:20.252 --> 02:09:22.221
AROUND WHY OTHER COWS OUT THERE.

02:09:22.287 --> 02:09:23.856
AND SO OR THERE WAS INCIDENTS

02:09:23.922 --> 02:09:26.792
WHERE COWS AND DOGS DIDN'T MIX

02:09:26.859 --> 02:09:28.160
VERY WELL AND PEOPLE ARE HIKING

02:09:28.227 --> 02:09:29.661
SO WE TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:09:29.728 --> 02:09:30.629
EDUCATE FOLKS.

02:09:30.696 --> 02:09:33.765
AND SAY THIS IS WHY WE HAVE CAL.

02:09:33.832 --> 02:09:35.567
IT'S TO REDUCE FIRE FUEL IS TO

02:09:35.634 --> 02:09:37.035
IMPROVE OUR HABITAT IT'S FOR

02:09:37.102 --> 02:09:38.937
BIODIVERSITY AND WE PUT UP SIGNS

02:09:39.004 --> 02:09:41.173
WE MADE YOU KNOW EDUCATIONAL

02:09:41.240 --> 02:09:42.774
PACKETS AND SO FOLKS ARE MORE

02:09:42.841 --> 02:09:44.042
COMFORTABLE IN SAYING Y.

02:09:44.109 --> 02:09:45.577
UNDERSTAND WHY THERE ARE ANIMALS

02:09:45.644 --> 02:09:47.146
GRAZING OUT HERE.

02:09:47.212 --> 02:09:48.213
AND WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW IS

02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:50.682
EXPANDING THAT THOSE PROJECTS IN

02:09:50.749 --> 02:09:52.818
THOSE OPPORTUNITIES FOR AREAS

02:09:52.885 --> 02:09:54.153
THAT ARE.

02:09:54.219 --> 02:09:55.821
THAT HAVE BEEN OR COULD BE

02:09:55.888 --> 02:09:57.456
IMPACTED BY THE RECENT FIRES

02:09:57.523 --> 02:09:58.991
THAT WE'VE HAD AND SO IT'S THIS

02:09:59.057 --> 02:10:01.293
IDEA OF OF GENERATING MAPPING TO

02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:02.194
SHOW THAT AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN

02:10:02.261 --> 02:10:03.729
GRACED OR AREAS THAT HAD

02:10:03.795 --> 02:10:04.763
AGRICULTURE.

02:10:04.830 --> 02:10:06.231
DIDN'T BURN ES SEVERELY OR THE

02:10:06.298 --> 02:10:07.900
FIRE STOPPED THERE AND SO IT'S

02:10:07.966 --> 02:10:08.967
TAKING THAT OPPORTUNITY TO

02:10:09.034 --> 02:10:10.936
EDUCATE THE PUBLIC ST WE NEED TO

02:10:11.003 --> 02:10:13.105
MANAGE THESE WORKING LANDSCAPES

02:10:13.172 --> 02:10:15.741
WHETHER IT'S MANAGING OUR TIMBER

02:10:15.807 --> 02:10:17.910
WHETHER IT'S GRAZING --

02:10:17.976 --> 02:10:19.912
AND I'M ALSO STARTING.

02:10:19.978 --> 02:10:21.580
BACK OF PRESCRIBED BURNING

02:10:21.647 --> 02:10:23.382
ASSOCIATIONS AND TALKING TO

02:10:23.448 --> 02:10:25.150
COLLEAGUES THAT THEY DID THIS

02:10:25.217 --> 02:10:27.286
FIFTY YEARS AGO AND SO IT'S NOT

02:10:27.352 --> 02:10:28.287
LIKE REINVENTING THE WHEEL IS

02:10:28.353 --> 02:10:30.789
JUST MAKING THE WILL TURN AGAIN.

02:10:30.856 --> 02:10:32.224
SO WHAT WE'RE DOING IS.

02:10:32.291 --> 02:10:33.992
STARTING THE PROCESS OF WORKING

02:10:34.059 --> 02:10:35.994
WITH LANDOWNERS TO SAY HOW DO WE

02:10:36.061 --> 02:10:38.230
MANAGE VEGETATION WITH ALL THE

02:10:38.297 --> 02:10:40.599
TOOLS WHAT IF WE USE GRAZING BUT

02:10:40.666 --> 02:10:42.234
IF WE USE PRESCRIBED FIRE AND SO

02:10:42.301 --> 02:10:43.735
WHAT WE'RE STARTING TO DO IS

02:10:43.802 --> 02:10:44.836
WORK WITH CAL FIRE AND AIR

02:10:44.903 --> 02:10:46.738
DISTRICTS.

02:10:46.805 --> 02:10:48.507
AND AND LOOKING AT HOW DO WE

02:10:48.574 --> 02:10:50.709
DECIDE WHAT WHERE'S THE BEST WAY

02:10:50.776 --> 02:10:52.644
AND THAT THE MARKETS ECONOMIC

02:10:52.711 --> 02:10:54.046
WAY TO MANAGE THESE.

02:10:54.112 --> 02:10:55.714
THESE OF WORKING LANDSCAPES TO

02:10:55.781 --> 02:10:56.448
REDUCE FIRE --

02:10:56.515 --> 02:10:57.950
IMPACTS [inaudible]

02:10:58.016 --> 02:10:59.751
NOW WHAT.

02:10:59.818 --> 02:11:01.086
PROBABLY GOING FORWARD WE'RE

02:11:01.153 --> 02:11:02.187
GOING TO NEED HELP WITH IS.

02:11:02.254 --> 02:11:04.156
IS THE AIRPORTS.

02:11:04.223 --> 02:11:05.457
AND A PENNY WHERE YOU'RE LOCATED

02:11:05.524 --> 02:11:07.092
OUT SOMETIMES THE REALLY

02:11:07.159 --> 02:11:09.161
AGREEABLE AND SOMETIMES BAY AREA

02:11:09.228 --> 02:11:10.362
THEY'RE NOT --

02:11:10.429 --> 02:11:11.597
AS OPEN TO BERNIE.

02:11:11.663 --> 02:11:13.599
SO I THINK.

02:11:13.665 --> 02:11:15.567
THE FIRES ARE OUR A A TRAVESTY

02:11:15.634 --> 02:11:17.102
BUT THERE IS ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY

02:11:17.169 --> 02:11:18.503
FOR US TO START ASKING THE

02:11:18.570 --> 02:11:19.938
PUBLIC TO WORK WITH US ON

02:11:20.005 --> 02:11:21.273
MANAGING THESE WORKING

02:11:21.340 --> 02:11:23.875
LANDSCAPES SO THAT'S THAT'S AN

02:11:23.942 --> 02:11:24.476
EXCITING WAY THAT WE'RE GOING

02:11:24.543 --> 02:11:25.677
FORWARD.

02:11:25.744 --> 02:11:27.479
SO WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT

02:11:27.546 --> 02:11:28.747
DOCUMENTING --

02:11:28.814 --> 02:11:30.716
PILOT PROJECTS AND LOOKING AT

02:11:30.782 --> 02:11:31.516
SUCCESS STORIES THAT HAVE

02:11:31.583 --> 02:11:33.151
HAPPENED AND PERHAPS TAKING THE

02:11:33.218 --> 02:11:35.821
SANTA ANA WATERSHED AREA AND AND

02:11:35.887 --> 02:11:37.823
LOOKING OUT THE IMPACTS FROM THE

02:11:37.889 --> 02:11:39.625
TOP OF THE WATERSHED TO THE

02:11:39.691 --> 02:11:41.226
USERS AND LA AND JUST.

02:11:41.293 --> 02:11:42.527
TRYING TO EDUCATE THE ARM

02:11:42.594 --> 02:11:44.296
ALTHOUGH.

02:11:44.363 --> 02:11:45.897
A WHOLE CONTINUUM OF THE

02:11:45.964 --> 02:11:48.133
IMPORTANCE OF WORKING LANDSCAPES

02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:49.668
LOOKING AT THE KING'S RIVER

02:11:49.735 --> 02:11:51.270
BASIN IN AND WHAT I'M WORKING

02:11:51.336 --> 02:11:52.504
WITH FARMERS THERE WHO ARE FOR

02:11:52.571 --> 02:11:55.641
OUR OF DOING FLOOD MITIGATION.

02:11:55.707 --> 02:11:56.541
AND THEY HAVE THEIR DOING THAT

02:11:56.608 --> 02:11:58.610
IN PERPETUITY SO IT'S THIS WHOLE

02:11:58.677 --> 02:12:00.379
IDEA OF A CAVE THEY'RE ALREADY

02:12:00.445 --> 02:12:02.047
GETTING PAYMENTS TO DO THAT.

02:12:02.114 --> 02:12:04.349
SO WHAT IF SOME ADDITIONAL OR

02:12:04.416 --> 02:12:05.917
ADDITIONAL BENEFITS OR

02:12:05.984 --> 02:12:07.653
ADDITIONAL STACKING OF ECOSYSTEM

02:12:07.719 --> 02:12:09.254
SERVICES THAT COULD BE PROVIDED

02:12:09.321 --> 02:12:10.656
IN COULD BE ALSO PROVIDE MONEY

02:12:10.722 --> 02:12:12.090
FOR THAT.

02:12:12.157 --> 02:12:13.859
I THINK THE KEY WHEN WE TALK

02:12:13.925 --> 02:12:15.761
ABOUT HOW DO WE MAKE THESE

02:12:15.827 --> 02:12:17.429
WORKING LANDSCAPES IS THAT THE

02:12:17.496 --> 02:12:19.164
ECONOMICS OF THEM --

02:12:19.231 --> 02:12:21.400
THE SOCIAL ASPECT OF IT AND

02:12:21.466 --> 02:12:23.168
ECOLOGICAL PEACE OF IT BUT IF

02:12:23.235 --> 02:12:24.503
YOU'RE OWNING LAND AND YOU

02:12:24.569 --> 02:12:25.604
WANTING TO KEEP IT FOR

02:12:25.671 --> 02:12:27.039
GENERATION AND GENERATION YOU

02:12:27.105 --> 02:12:28.507
HAVE TO MAKE MONEY AT IT SO WE

02:12:28.573 --> 02:12:31.310
HAVE TO INCENTIVIZE AS OPPOSED.

02:12:31.376 --> 02:12:33.845
TO REGULATE THESE LANDOWNERS AND

02:12:33.912 --> 02:12:35.614
THESE WORKING LANDSCAPES TO KEEP

02:12:35.681 --> 02:12:36.148
THEM ACTIVE AND KEEP THEM

02:12:36.214 --> 02:12:36.581
WORKING [inaudible]

02:12:36.648 --> 02:12:39.818
SO -- I

02:12:39.885 --> 02:12:41.153
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE

02:12:41.219 --> 02:12:43.655
LOOK AT THAT WE HAVE.

02:12:43.722 --> 02:12:45.490
ALL THE TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX AND

02:12:45.557 --> 02:12:47.759
THAT FROM A SCIENCE STANDPOINT

02:12:47.826 --> 02:12:51.229
WERE ALSO LOOKING AT IDEAS OF

02:12:51.296 --> 02:12:53.899
INCREASING --

02:12:53.965 --> 02:12:56.401
MARKETS FOR FOR CARBON MARKETS

02:12:56.468 --> 02:12:58.170
FOR HABITAT CONSERVATION AND SO

02:12:58.236 --> 02:13:00.038
LOOKING AT THOSE BENEFITS AND

02:13:00.105 --> 02:13:01.640
AND ENCOURAGING LANDOWNERS TO

02:13:01.707 --> 02:13:04.476
THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE ADD VALUE

02:13:04.543 --> 02:13:06.144
TO OUR WORKING LANDS PERHAPS TWO

02:13:06.211 --> 02:13:07.546
AGRITOURISM AND MAYBE THERE

02:13:07.612 --> 02:13:09.348
MIGHT BE SOME INCENTIVES. TO TO

02:13:09.414 --> 02:13:11.917
LOOK AT INCREASING OPPORTUNITIES

02:13:11.983 --> 02:13:12.984
FOR AGRITOURISM AND REDUCING

02:13:13.051 --> 02:13:15.454
LIABILITY ISSUES THAT IMPACT THE

02:13:15.520 --> 02:13:17.522
BILL THE ABILITY TO BRING PEOPLE

02:13:17.589 --> 02:13:18.757
ONTO YOUR PROPERTY.

02:13:18.824 --> 02:13:19.925
BECAUSE OF SOMETHING HAPPENS ON

02:13:19.991 --> 02:13:21.593
THE PROPERTY THEN THE THE

02:13:21.660 --> 02:13:23.195
LANDOWNERS LIABLE AND SO THERE'S

02:13:23.261 --> 02:13:25.030
THERE'S OTHER EXAMPLES OUTSIDE

02:13:25.097 --> 02:13:26.732
OF CALIFORNIA THAT WE'RE GOING

02:13:26.798 --> 02:13:28.700
TO BE BRINGING IN TO SHOW TO SAY.

02:13:28.767 --> 02:13:30.469
HERE'S WHAT THEY DO IN OREGON

02:13:30.535 --> 02:13:33.739
THERE'S A REDUCE LIABILITY IT'S

02:13:33.805 --> 02:13:35.674
IT HELPS PEOPLE TO COME ON IN

02:13:35.741 --> 02:13:37.909
AND ADD VALUE TO THEIR PROPERTY.

02:13:37.976 --> 02:13:38.977
AND SO.

02:13:39.044 --> 02:13:40.946
ANOTHER ISSUE IS THAT WE WANT TO

02:13:41.012 --> 02:13:42.714
LOOK AT INCREASING MAPPING AND

02:13:42.781 --> 02:13:44.149
WHAT THE MAPPING SKILLS THAT WE

02:13:44.216 --> 02:13:45.217
CAN START TO DOCUMENT AND

02:13:45.283 --> 02:13:47.085
PRIORITIZE.

02:13:47.152 --> 02:13:49.321
WHERE'S THE BIGGEST --

02:13:49.388 --> 02:13:51.757
OPPORTUNITIES TO DO SOME I IT

02:13:51.823 --> 02:13:53.291
IMPLEMENTATION OF SOME OF THESE

02:13:53.358 --> 02:13:55.293
WORKING LAND PRACTICES AND HOW

02:13:55.360 --> 02:13:57.429
DO WE DOCUMENT THE THE BIGGEST --

02:13:57.496 --> 02:13:59.564
RETURN ON THE INVESTMENT OF SOME

02:13:59.631 --> 02:14:01.500
OF THESE PROJECTS SO START TO

02:14:01.566 --> 02:14:03.735
BUILD THE CAPACITY AND TAKE ALL

02:14:03.802 --> 02:14:05.003
OF THESE GREAT STORIES THAT YOU

02:14:05.070 --> 02:14:05.937
HEARD EARLIER.

02:14:06.004 --> 02:14:07.739
AND LOOK OUT.

02:14:07.806 --> 02:14:09.274
DO WE HAVE THE SCIENCE TO BACK

02:14:09.341 --> 02:14:10.275
IT WHAT ADDITIONAL RESEARCH DO

02:14:10.342 --> 02:14:11.543
WE NEED TO DO AND HOW DO WE TELL

02:14:11.610 --> 02:14:13.779
THAT STORY.

02:14:13.845 --> 02:14:14.479
SO I'M JUST GIVING YOU AN

02:14:14.546 --> 02:14:16.915
OVERVIEW AND WHAT WHAT --

02:14:16.982 --> 02:14:18.650
WHAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING WORKING

02:14:18.717 --> 02:14:21.319
THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA FORWARD --

02:14:21.386 --> 02:14:23.455
AND THAT THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMIC.

02:14:23.522 --> 02:14:25.424
SUMMIT IS THE ECOSYSTEM SERVICE

02:14:25.490 --> 02:14:27.492
WORKING LANDSCAPES IS BRINGING

02:14:27.559 --> 02:14:29.828
THIS CONCEPT FORWARD IN NOVEMBER.

02:14:29.895 --> 02:14:30.429
AND WILL CONTINUE TO PRESENT

02:14:30.495 --> 02:14:34.065
THIS SO CREATED THIS ECOSYSTEM

02:14:34.132 --> 02:14:35.066
SERVICE IN CALIFORNIA WORKING

02:14:35.133 --> 02:14:36.968
LANDSCAPES PAPER.

02:14:37.035 --> 02:14:37.269
THAT -- WAS

02:14:37.335 --> 02:14:38.737
SENT.

02:14:38.804 --> 02:14:41.306
AND IT KIND OF JUST COVERS WHAT

02:14:41.373 --> 02:14:43.074
ECOSYSTEM SERVICES ARE IN SOME

02:14:43.141 --> 02:14:45.343
OF THOSE POTENTIAL THERE'S

02:14:45.410 --> 02:14:48.580
THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION

02:14:48.647 --> 02:14:49.614
THERE AND SO WE BOIL DOWN TO

02:14:49.681 --> 02:14:50.782
THIS.

02:14:50.849 --> 02:14:52.384
AS ONE PAGER MAKES IT EASIER TO

02:14:52.451 --> 02:14:54.986
READ SO WITHOUT I WOULD I WOULD

02:14:55.053 --> 02:14:56.288
BE HAPPY TO HAVE A DIALOGUE OR

02:14:56.354 --> 02:14:59.157

THEIR APPLICATION.

02:15:11.536 --> 02:15:12.804
CERTAIN WHAT ONE OF THE

02:15:12.871 --> 02:15:14.372
INSTANCES FOR EXAMPLE IS THAT IN

02:15:14.439 --> 02:15:15.373
THE NORTH BAY WE WERE REALLY

02:15:15.440 --> 02:15:17.809
PIONEERS IN ORGANIC MILK STRAUSS

02:15:17.876 --> 02:15:19.110
BEING THE FIRST IN THE STATE TO

02:15:19.177 --> 02:15:20.479
GO ORGANIC AND THEN.

02:15:20.545 --> 02:15:21.646
EVERYONE FIGURED OUT THIS WAS A

02:15:21.713 --> 02:15:23.682
WAY TO MAKE MONEY AND TO MAKE IT

02:15:23.748 --> 02:15:25.484

02:15:28.687 --> 02:15:30.522
GLUT OF ORGANIC MILK AND THAT'S

02:15:30.589 --> 02:15:32.190
PUTTING A LOT OF PRESSURE ON OUR

02:15:32.257 --> 02:15:33.191
DAIRIES --

02:15:33.258 --> 02:15:35.527
IN IN CERTAINLY WE'VE SEEN THE

02:15:35.594 --> 02:15:38.163
POSITIVE OUTCOMES OF OF HAVING

02:15:38.230 --> 02:15:38.763
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE IT

02:15:38.830 --> 02:15:40.899
WHICH IS AMAZING SHE'S.

02:15:40.966 --> 02:15:42.467

POSITIVE STORY FOR OUR

02:15:46.638 --> 02:15:48.273
CONSTITUENTS WE HEARD FROM ONE

02:15:48.340 --> 02:15:49.941

TAX.

02:15:57.148 --> 02:15:58.450
THAT GOES TO FUND EASEMENTS TO

02:15:58.517 --> 02:15:59.951
KEEP.

THIS YEAR THAT WE'RE ABLE TO

02:16:44.396 --> 02:16:45.864
SHOW THAT OFF.

ALSO GOING TO BE ABLE TO I TAKE

02:16:52.137 --> 02:16:53.805
PEOPLE TO WORKING LANCE.

SURE SURE WITH A LITTLE BIT

02:16:55.040 --> 02:16:56.274
ABOUT THE HEALTHY SOILS

02:16:56.341 --> 02:16:58.009
INITIATIVE THAT WE HAVE EVEN

02:16:58.076 --> 02:16:58.777
TEACH THEM ABOUT OCEAN

02:16:58.843 --> 02:17:00.145
ACIDIFICATION AND HOW THAT

02:17:00.211 --> 02:17:01.846
IMPACTS OUR OUR FARMING IN THE

02:17:01.913 --> 02:17:02.647
WATER.

02:17:02.714 --> 02:17:04.115
THAT WE DO ON THE COAST AS WELL

02:17:04.182 --> 02:17:05.083

02:17:05.150 --> 02:17:06.952
GOOD STORIES TO TELL SO THANK

02:17:07.018 --> 02:17:07.686

THANK YOU I'M YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE

02:17:09.921 --> 02:17:11.423
WE ALWAYS HAVING TO KEEP GOING

KEEP IT STEPPING UP AND IN YOU

02:17:12.958 --> 02:17:14.426
YOU BRING UP A GOOD POINT ABOUT

02:17:14.492 --> 02:17:15.327
THE ORGANIC MALCOLM.

02:17:15.393 --> 02:17:16.194
IN THIS IS KIND OF A NEW THE

02:17:16.261 --> 02:17:18.229
NEXT PHASE.

02:17:18.296 --> 02:17:20.498
CINEMA COUNTY IN MARIN COUNTY.

02:17:20.565 --> 02:17:22.567
SMALLER SCALE DAIRIES BUT WHAT.

02:17:22.634 --> 02:17:23.335
WE HAD A COMPANY --

02:17:23.401 --> 02:17:24.836
THOSE WALLABY.

02:17:24.903 --> 02:17:26.237
AND WHILE WE WAS BOUGHT BY A

02:17:26.304 --> 02:17:27.639
BIGGER COMPANY WHICH I THINK WAS

02:17:27.706 --> 02:17:29.107
BOUGHT BY A BIGGER COMPANY AND

02:17:29.174 --> 02:17:31.009
AS YOU AS YOU GET A WITH FARTHER

02:17:31.076 --> 02:17:32.744
AWAY FROM THE SOURCE OF THE MILK

02:17:32.811 --> 02:17:33.411
THE BIGGEST.

02:17:33.478 --> 02:17:34.980
THE OF THE CURRENT OWNER NOW

02:17:35.046 --> 02:17:36.448
REALLY DOESN'T CARE THAT STORY

02:17:36.514 --> 02:17:38.116
THEY'VE LOST THAT STORY AND SO

02:17:38.183 --> 02:17:39.117
NOW WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS

02:17:39.184 --> 02:17:40.652
THERE'S EIGHT ORGANIC DAIRIES

02:17:40.719 --> 02:17:41.686
THAT HAVE NO PLACE TO TAKE THEIR

02:17:41.753 --> 02:17:42.854
MILK.

02:17:42.921 --> 02:17:45.090
AND SO WE'RE LOOKING AT WHAT'S

02:17:45.156 --> 02:17:46.658
THE NEXT THING AND SO WERE

02:17:46.725 --> 02:17:47.993
ALWAYS HAVING TO KEEP WHAT'S THE

02:17:48.059 --> 02:17:49.628
NEXT STORY HOW DO WE TELL THAT

02:17:49.694 --> 02:17:50.895
WHAT'S THE NEXT PRODUCT THAT

02:17:50.962 --> 02:17:52.063
WE'RE GOING TO CREATE.

02:17:52.130 --> 02:17:55.000
WHETHER IT'S A KEY FOR OR ITS

02:17:55.066 --> 02:17:57.035
JOB ICE CREAM AND AND YOU KNOW

02:17:57.102 --> 02:17:58.303
YOU COULD ALWAYS USE MORE CHEESE

02:17:58.370 --> 02:18:00.705
BUT IT'S IT'S IT'S A IT'S ALWAYS.

02:18:00.772 --> 02:18:01.906
AGRICULTURE IS ALWAYS GOT TO

02:18:01.973 --> 02:18:03.608
KEEP GOING AND SO WHAT WE'RE

02:18:03.675 --> 02:18:06.244
LOOKING AT ALSO IS IS TECHNOLOGY.

02:18:06.311 --> 02:18:08.780
AND ALLOWING AND NOT MAKING THAT

02:18:08.847 --> 02:18:10.582
THE REGULATIONS SO SO ONEROUS

02:18:10.649 --> 02:18:12.183
THAT THEY CAN APPLY THAT THE

02:18:12.250 --> 02:18:13.985
TECHNOLOGY AND I KNOW A LOT OF

02:18:14.052 --> 02:18:16.921
PEOPLE VERY INTERESTED IN THEM --

02:18:16.988 --> 02:18:19.491
THE MILKING TECHNOLOGY WHERE YOU

02:18:19.557 --> 02:18:21.092
HAVE AUTOMATIC MELCHIOR'S

02:18:21.159 --> 02:18:22.227
BECAUSE THE LABOR SO SO

02:18:22.293 --> 02:18:24.496
DIFFICULT TO GET AND SO WITH

02:18:24.562 --> 02:18:25.797
THAT WHOLE IDEA OF OF TRYING TO

02:18:25.864 --> 02:18:27.298
BALANCE KEEPING THESE FAMILY

02:18:27.365 --> 02:18:28.233
FARMS --

02:18:28.299 --> 02:18:29.968
ACTIVELY AND AND ECONOMICALLY

02:18:30.035 --> 02:18:31.870
VIABLE AND YET MEETING THE NEEDS

02:18:31.936 --> 02:18:35.240
A COMMUNITY.

02:18:35.306 --> 02:18:36.241
IT'S GREAT WELL REALLY

02:18:36.307 --> 02:18:37.742
APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE TODAY

02:18:37.809 --> 02:18:40.011
AND YOU'RE YOUR YOUR INFORMATION

02:18:40.078 --> 02:18:41.279
I THINK WE'RE ALL INTERESTED IN

02:18:41.346 --> 02:18:43.815
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW --

02:18:43.882 --> 02:18:46.284
TO CREATE SUSTAINABLE WORKING

02:18:46.351 --> 02:18:47.952
LANDSCAPES AND TO REALLY FOCUS

02:18:48.019 --> 02:18:49.387
ON WHAT ARE THE POLICIES HERE AT

02:18:49.454 --> 02:18:50.889
THE STATE THAT WE CAN.

02:18:50.955 --> 02:18:53.425
CHANGE OR THAT WE CAN --

02:18:53.491 --> 02:18:55.527
THAT WE CAN UTILIZE TO KEEP OUR

02:18:55.593 --> 02:18:59.698
OUR AGRICULTURE GOING --

02:18:59.764 --> 02:19:01.866
MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS --

02:19:01.933 --> 02:19:03.368
VISIT IF WE DON'T DO IT RIGHT WE

02:19:03.435 --> 02:19:04.569
START LOSING.

02:19:04.636 --> 02:19:08.673
AG LAND AND RANGE LAND AND AND

02:19:08.740 --> 02:19:10.442
ONCE IT STARTS MOVING IN THAT

02:19:10.508 --> 02:19:12.210
DIRECTION IT'S VERY HARD BECAUSE

02:19:12.277 --> 02:19:13.745
ONCE YOU BUILD ON IT THAT TALLER

02:19:13.812 --> 02:19:16.614
IS AND AND IN MY REGION --

02:19:16.681 --> 02:19:18.149
THERE'S A REAL LACK OF PUBLIC

02:19:18.216 --> 02:19:20.085
TRANSPORTATION SO PEOPLE HAVE TO

02:19:20.151 --> 02:19:21.486
DRIVE.

02:19:21.553 --> 02:19:23.388
IN THEIR IN THEIR VEHICLES AND

02:19:23.455 --> 02:19:24.756
SINCE THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE

02:19:24.823 --> 02:19:26.624
NOW ARE COMING FROM THE SILICON

02:19:26.691 --> 02:19:27.992
VALLEY INTO THEIR IN --

02:19:28.059 --> 02:19:30.028
TO MY DISTRICT --

02:19:30.095 --> 02:19:31.096
THE ROAD RACERS PRETTY

02:19:31.162 --> 02:19:32.864
SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED DURING

02:19:32.931 --> 02:19:35.767
THAT THE PEAK TRAFFIC HOURS.

02:19:35.834 --> 02:19:37.669
AND SO THE QUESTION BECOMES DO

02:19:37.736 --> 02:19:38.470
WE INVEST IN PUBLIC

02:19:38.536 --> 02:19:39.537
TRANSPORTATION OR DO WE BUILD

02:19:39.604 --> 02:19:40.972
BIGGER ROADS.

02:19:41.039 --> 02:19:42.440
AND THE MILKMAN IT YOU START

02:19:42.507 --> 02:19:43.541
BUILDING BIGGER ROADS ARE SECT

02:19:43.608 --> 02:19:45.410
EXPECTATIONS --

02:19:45.477 --> 02:19:47.512
AND AG LAND STARTS SEEMS. TWO

02:19:47.579 --> 02:19:50.014
EXPONENTIALLY TAKEOFF AND SO HOW

02:19:50.081 --> 02:19:51.616
WE SET.

02:19:51.683 --> 02:19:54.452
HOW WE WORK ON OUR POLICIES AND

02:19:54.519 --> 02:19:55.019
TRY TO FIGURE OUT WE HAVE WE

02:19:55.086 --> 02:19:56.154
HAVE [inaudible]

02:19:56.221 --> 02:19:58.056
PRECIOUS.

02:19:58.123 --> 02:19:58.923
FEW RESOURCES IN A NUMBER OF

02:19:58.990 --> 02:20:03.061
POTS AND WHERE THEY END UP GOING --

02:20:03.128 --> 02:20:05.296
WILL DICTATE KIND OF THE KIND OF

02:20:05.363 --> 02:20:07.799
DEVELOPMENT AND THE THE KIND OF

02:20:07.866 --> 02:20:10.101
DEVELOPMENT AND THE EXPANSION ON

02:20:10.168 --> 02:20:12.504
AG RANGE LAND AND SO I JUST WANT

02:20:12.570 --> 02:20:13.872
TO MAKE SURE WE'RE PREPARED FOR

02:20:13.938 --> 02:20:15.573
SOME OF THAT REPERCUSSIONS IF WE

02:20:15.640 --> 02:20:16.474
DON'T PLAN.

02:20:16.541 --> 02:20:18.643
WELL AND LEAVE AND LEAVING IT UP

02:20:18.710 --> 02:20:20.044
TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO DO THAT

02:20:20.111 --> 02:20:22.647
PLANNING SO IT IT SAM.

02:20:22.714 --> 02:20:24.149
THE MORE INFORMATION WE CAN GET

02:20:24.215 --> 02:20:25.617
OUT ABOUT WORKING LANCE AND

02:20:25.683 --> 02:20:27.318
ABOUT HOW --

02:20:27.385 --> 02:20:30.922
HOW THEY OPERATE IN YOU INCLUDED

02:20:30.989 --> 02:20:31.523
A BUNCH OF LAND SAID I DIDN'T

02:20:31.589 --> 02:20:33.458
THINK I'M MORE FOCUSED ON REACH

02:20:33.525 --> 02:20:35.026
LAND PARK LAND IN AN ATLANTA?

02:20:35.093 --> 02:20:36.928
BUT THERE ARE ALL A LOT OF OTHER

02:20:36.995 --> 02:20:38.897
RESOURCES OUT THERE THAT WE NEED

02:20:38.963 --> 02:20:39.798
TO CONSIDER AS WELL SO I

02:20:39.864 --> 02:20:41.132
APPRECIATE ALL THE RESEARCHER

02:20:41.199 --> 02:20:42.200
DOING AND AND THE WORK THAT

02:20:42.267 --> 02:20:43.134
YOU'RE DOING.

02:20:43.201 --> 02:20:44.536
WELL THANK YOU AND I I THINK

02:20:44.602 --> 02:20:46.204
IT'S WHAT I FIND IS THAT THERE.

02:20:46.271 --> 02:20:48.473
YOU CAN ALWAYS FIND A TOPIC THAT

02:20:48.540 --> 02:20:49.674
SOMEBODY'S INTERESTED IN AND WE

02:20:49.741 --> 02:20:51.176
HAVE A BURN MARIN COUNTY AND WE

02:20:51.242 --> 02:20:53.778
HAVE A LOT OF INTERESTED IN

02:20:53.845 --> 02:20:55.280
GRAZING ANIMALS AND DON'T OWN

02:20:55.346 --> 02:20:56.114
GRAZING ANIMALS BUT THEY THEY

02:20:56.181 --> 02:20:57.549
HAVE A PASSION FOR SEQUESTERING

02:20:57.615 --> 02:20:58.449
CARBON.

02:20:58.516 --> 02:20:59.284
AND IT'S JUST TAKING THAT

02:20:59.350 --> 02:21:00.985
OPPORTUNITY TO EDUCATE THE FOLKS

02:21:01.052 --> 02:21:02.821
AND SAY WELL TO GET THE CARBON

02:21:02.887 --> 02:21:04.522
INTO THE SOIL IN THESE RANGE

02:21:04.589 --> 02:21:05.857
LANDS SOILS YOU HAVE TO USE A

02:21:05.924 --> 02:21:08.159
GRAZING ANIMAL YES AND AND SO

02:21:08.226 --> 02:21:10.094
THEN THERE THERE EXCEPT THAT

02:21:10.161 --> 02:21:11.262
BECAUSE THEY GET THE HEALTHY

02:21:11.329 --> 02:21:12.931
SOIL ASPECT OF IT AND SO.

02:21:12.997 --> 02:21:14.199
IT'S REALLY JUST FIGURING OUT

02:21:14.265 --> 02:21:15.533
HOW DO WE TELL THE AGRICULTURE

02:21:15.600 --> 02:21:16.167
STORY [inaudible]

02:21:16.234 --> 02:21:17.735
DIFFERENTLY.

02:21:17.802 --> 02:21:19.237
THEN THAT WE'RE RAISING ALL THIS

02:21:19.304 --> 02:21:20.905
FOOD IN ITS GREAT FOOD AND WE

02:21:20.972 --> 02:21:22.140
HAVE ALL THESE YOU KNOW.

02:21:22.207 --> 02:21:23.374
DIFFERENT THINGS THAT PEOPLE

02:21:23.441 --> 02:21:25.677
DON'T HAVE BUT THEN TO TAKE

02:21:25.743 --> 02:21:26.811
THAT'S WHERE I THINK THE KEY

02:21:26.878 --> 02:21:28.346
PIECES THE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES

02:21:28.413 --> 02:21:30.081
AND TALKING ABOUT THE THE PUBLIC

02:21:30.148 --> 02:21:31.382
BENEFITS THAT THEY GIVE US.

02:21:31.449 --> 02:21:32.650
WHAT WHAT WHAT I FOUND

02:21:32.717 --> 02:21:33.785
IMPRESSIVE IS THERE WAS AN

02:21:33.852 --> 02:21:34.919
ARTICLE ABOUT?

02:21:34.986 --> 02:21:37.488
A COUPLE IT BOUGHT A RANCH AND

02:21:37.555 --> 02:21:39.224
THEY GOT RID OF ALL THE ANIMALS

02:21:39.290 --> 02:21:41.960
BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT WAS --

02:21:42.026 --> 02:21:43.394
WELL THEY DIDN'T PLAN ON RAISING

02:21:43.461 --> 02:21:44.662
ANIMALS I GUESS NUMBER ONE AND

02:21:44.729 --> 02:21:46.531
NUMBER TWO IS A THOUGHT IT WAS --

02:21:46.598 --> 02:21:48.566
POLLUTING THE ENVIRONMENT AND SO --

02:21:48.633 --> 02:21:50.602
IN THE END THERE THERE THERE

02:21:50.668 --> 02:21:52.670
THAT RANGE LAND STARTED --

02:21:52.737 --> 02:21:55.139
DETERIORATING SIGNIFICANTLY AND

02:21:55.206 --> 02:21:56.674
THEY REALIZED THAT THERE WAS A

02:21:56.741 --> 02:21:58.243
VALUE IN HAVING THOSE ANIMALS

02:21:58.309 --> 02:21:59.143
AND THEY BROUGHT THEM BACK IN

02:21:59.210 --> 02:22:01.279
THEIR LEARNING NEW NEW --

02:22:01.346 --> 02:22:02.580
NEW WAYS TO BE ABLE TO INTEGRATE

02:22:02.647 --> 02:22:04.048
THE ANIMALS IN WITH WITH THAT

02:22:04.115 --> 02:22:05.550
KIND OF HEALTHY SOILS THAT

02:22:05.617 --> 02:22:07.252
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR THAT WAS.

02:22:07.318 --> 02:22:08.820
THAT WAS IN NEW INFORMATION TO

02:22:08.887 --> 02:22:09.988
ME AND I FOUND IT FASCINATING

02:22:10.054 --> 02:22:11.923
BECAUSE IT WE MAKE ASSUMPTIONS

02:22:11.990 --> 02:22:13.258
ABOUT THINGS WITHOUT ANY

02:22:13.324 --> 02:22:15.093
INFORMATION AND THEY THEY WERE

02:22:15.159 --> 02:22:16.227
WRONG AND THEY HAD THAT.

02:22:16.294 --> 02:22:19.230
GO BACK AND ACTUALLY RE DO THEIR

02:22:19.297 --> 02:22:21.366
THEIR PLANTS BECAUSE THEY FOUND

02:22:21.432 --> 02:22:23.067
THAT THE ANIMALS HAD A BENEFIT

02:22:23.134 --> 02:22:24.402
TO THE LANDED SO THAT'S REALLY

02:22:24.469 --> 02:22:25.970
IMPORTANT AND I THINK THE MORE

02:22:26.037 --> 02:22:28.539
THAT WE CAN TELL I THINK --

02:22:28.606 --> 02:22:30.008
ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRACE POINT

02:22:30.074 --> 02:22:31.175
ABOUT --

02:22:31.242 --> 02:22:32.844
PEOPLE'S ASSUMPTIONS IS THAT

02:22:32.911 --> 02:22:33.645
THEY JUST DON'T HAVE A LOT OF

02:22:33.711 --> 02:22:35.413
INFORMATION.

02:22:35.480 --> 02:22:38.716
AND MY CONCERN IS IS THAT.

02:22:38.783 --> 02:22:40.051
WHEN WE HAD A DROUGHT PEOPLE

02:22:40.118 --> 02:22:42.120
START THINKING ABOUT WHAT SHOULD

02:22:42.186 --> 02:22:43.588
WE NOT BE DOING ANY MORE?

02:22:43.655 --> 02:22:46.090
AND THE NOT BE DOING ANY MORE IS

02:22:46.157 --> 02:22:47.659
TO CAN AND CAN'T GROW.

02:22:47.725 --> 02:22:49.827
WHERE THEY CAN AND CAN'T GROW IT

02:22:49.894 --> 02:22:50.628
AND IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT

02:22:50.695 --> 02:22:52.196
THAT'S THE WRONG TIME TO BE

02:22:52.263 --> 02:22:53.531
DOING THAT NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER

02:22:53.598 --> 02:22:54.766
TWO IS WE'VE NEVER EVER BEEN A

02:22:54.832 --> 02:22:55.733
STATE WHERE WE TELL PEOPLE THEY

02:22:55.800 --> 02:22:57.001
CAN'T?

02:22:57.068 --> 02:22:57.568
THEY CAN'T DO THEIR BUSINESS

02:22:57.635 --> 02:22:58.636
ANYMORE.

02:22:58.703 --> 02:23:00.004
THE MARKET SHOULD CONTROL THAT

02:23:00.071 --> 02:23:02.707
NOT -- A A

02:23:02.774 --> 02:23:04.375
SCARCITY AND A TIME WHEN THEY

02:23:04.442 --> 02:23:06.878
WERE IN CRISIS SO ON THE MORE WE

02:23:06.945 --> 02:23:08.246
CAN GET THIS INFORMATION UP I

02:23:08.313 --> 02:23:09.948
THINK THE BETTER DECISIONS WILL

02:23:10.014 --> 02:23:11.582
BE ABLE TO MAKE AND SO IT'S

02:23:11.649 --> 02:23:13.151

02:24:17.248 --> 02:24:18.316
ENSURING THAT LOCAL A

02:24:18.383 --> 02:24:19.417
COMMUNITIES HAVE THE WATER THEY

02:24:19.484 --> 02:24:19.984
NEED.

02:24:20.051 --> 02:24:21.152
THESE PROJECTS INCLUDE FISH

02:24:21.219 --> 02:24:22.453
HABITAT.

02:24:22.520 --> 02:24:24.455
UP PROJECTS UP FISH SCREENING OF

02:24:24.522 --> 02:24:25.957
AGRICULTURAL WATER DIVERSIONS

02:24:26.024 --> 02:24:27.892
AND AGAIN COMPREHENSIVE EFFORTS

02:24:27.959 --> 02:24:29.427
TO RE MANAGER FLOWS IN SUCH A

02:24:29.494 --> 02:24:30.695
MANNER THAT WE'RE PROTECTING OUR

02:24:30.762 --> 02:24:32.563
ECONOMY PROVIDE ENSURING WE HAVE

02:24:32.630 --> 02:24:33.998
WATER FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES.

02:24:34.065 --> 02:24:35.566
BUT ALSO ENSURING WITH HELP YOU

02:24:35.633 --> 02:24:37.235
HEALTHY FISH POPULATIONS WE

02:24:37.301 --> 02:24:38.336
THINK THAT THAT TYPE OF

02:24:38.403 --> 02:24:39.637
COLLABORATIVE COMPREHENSIVE

02:24:39.704 --> 02:24:41.139
APPROACH IS EXACTLY WHAT THE

02:24:41.205 --> 02:24:42.740
STATE RIGHT NEEDS RIGHT NOW.

02:24:42.807 --> 02:24:43.574
AS YOU KNOW THERE MANY

02:24:43.641 --> 02:24:44.842
DISCUSSIONS UNDER WAY ABOUT HOW

02:24:44.909 --> 02:24:46.911
WE MANAGE OUR RIVERS AND A WATER

02:24:46.978 --> 02:24:48.446
SYSTEM AS A STATE A WE THINK

02:24:48.513 --> 02:24:50.081
THAT LOOKING BEYOND FLOW TO

02:24:50.148 --> 02:24:51.482
THESE OTHER TYPES OF PROJECTS.

02:24:51.549 --> 02:24:52.884
ON AS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF

02:24:52.950 --> 02:24:55.753
LAW.

02:24:55.820 --> 02:24:57.121
IS REALLY KEY SO THANK YOU FOR

02:24:57.188 --> 02:24:58.623
THIS DISCUSSION TODAY AND AND WE

02:24:58.689 --> 02:24:59.490
APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:24:59.557 --> 02:25:00.525
COMMENT WILL AND THANK YOU FOR

02:25:00.591 --> 02:25:01.659
YOUR COMMENTS BECAUSE THAT WAS

02:25:01.726 --> 02:25:04.062
EXACTLY THE THOUGHT I HAD ABOUT

02:25:04.128 --> 02:25:05.396
THAT PROJECT THEIR RIGHTS

02:25:05.463 --> 02:25:06.898
PROJECT BECAUSE IF THEY'RE IF

02:25:06.964 --> 02:25:08.232
THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL THEN THERE

02:25:08.299 --> 02:25:08.499
MAY BE.

02:25:08.566 --> 02:25:11.069
OTHER STRATEGIES FOR OUR A

02:25:11.135 --> 02:25:12.403
RESURGENCE OF THE SALMON

02:25:12.470 --> 02:25:13.738
POPULATION THAT WE HAVEN'T EVEN

02:25:13.805 --> 02:25:15.306
CONSIDERED IN THAT THE FLOWS ARE

02:25:15.373 --> 02:25:16.574
NOT THE ONLY ANSWER I GUESS IS

02:25:16.641 --> 02:25:17.909
MY WATER SUPPLIERS UP AND DOWN

02:25:17.975 --> 02:25:19.444
THE STATE ON THE LEADING EDGE OF

02:25:19.510 --> 02:25:20.611
IMPLEMENTING THESE PROGRAMS.

02:25:20.678 --> 02:25:22.513
PROJECTS MANY MORE PLANNED AN

02:25:22.580 --> 02:25:23.815
EVEN MORE POSSIBLE AND I THINK

02:25:23.881 --> 02:25:25.416
THE EXCITING POTENTIAL FOR FLOOD

02:25:25.483 --> 02:25:26.317
PLAIN --

02:25:26.384 --> 02:25:27.585
RECONNECTING FLOOD PLAINS IS AN

02:25:27.652 --> 02:25:29.020
EXAMPLE OF THAT THANK YOU VERY

02:25:29.087 --> 02:25:30.688
MUCH.

02:25:30.755 --> 02:25:36.627
IS THERE ANYONE ELSE.

GOOD AFTERNOON MY CLAIBORNE WITH

02:25:37.862 --> 02:25:38.963
LEADERSHIP COUNCIL IN WITH YOUR

02:25:39.030 --> 02:25:41.032
INDULGENCE CHAIR WOULD IT BE

02:25:41.099 --> 02:25:44.135
POSSIBLE TO SET FOR PUBLIC HONOR.

02:25:44.202 --> 02:25:44.702
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T GET TOO

02:25:44.769 --> 02:25:47.004
COMFORTABLE.

02:25:47.071 --> 02:25:49.907
I'LL TRY TO BE AS BRIEF AS I CAN --

02:25:49.974 --> 02:25:51.843
SO I WANT TO START BY SAYING

LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE

02:25:55.146 --> 02:25:56.013
AND ACCOUNTABILITY.

02:25:56.080 --> 02:25:57.281
AND I REPRESENT --

02:25:57.348 --> 02:25:58.382
RESIDENTS OF DISADVANTAGED

02:25:58.449 --> 02:25:59.484
COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT SAN

02:25:59.550 --> 02:26:00.885
JOAQUIN VALLEY AND EAST

02:26:00.952 --> 02:26:02.186
COACHELLA VALLEY.

02:26:02.253 --> 02:26:03.921
I DON'T WANNA START MY COMMENT

02:26:03.988 --> 02:26:05.423
BY SAYING THAT WE SUPPORT AG

02:26:05.490 --> 02:26:06.958
LAND CONVERSION AND SUSTAINABLE

02:26:07.024 --> 02:26:07.759
AGRICULTURE.

02:26:07.825 --> 02:26:09.093
AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MANY

02:26:09.160 --> 02:26:10.161
OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WERE

02:26:10.228 --> 02:26:11.229
DISCUSSED TODAY SO THANK YOU FOR

02:26:11.295 --> 02:26:13.831
THIS OPPORTUNITY --

02:26:13.898 --> 02:26:14.632
AS WE'VE HEARD TODAY

02:26:14.699 --> 02:26:16.134
CONSERVATION OF AG LAND AS

02:26:16.200 --> 02:26:17.668
OPPOSED AG LAND CONVERSION TO

02:26:17.735 --> 02:26:19.170
URBAN LAND USES DISCOURAGES

02:26:19.237 --> 02:26:20.605
URBAN SPRAWL --

02:26:20.671 --> 02:26:22.373
THAT INCREASES GHG EMISSIONS

02:26:22.440 --> 02:26:24.275
VEHICLES MILES TRAVELED AND

02:26:24.342 --> 02:26:26.377
LOCAL AIR QUALITY IMPACTS --

02:26:26.444 --> 02:26:27.411
WE WORKED ON REGIONAL

02:26:27.478 --> 02:26:29.580
TRANSPORTATION PLANS THROUGHOUT

02:26:29.647 --> 02:26:31.115
THE FOR THE LAST HOUR WHAT FIVE

02:26:31.182 --> 02:26:33.117
DEAD. SEVEN YEARS THAT

02:26:33.184 --> 02:26:35.720
LEADERSHIP COUNCIL AS IT EXISTED.

02:26:35.786 --> 02:26:37.555
AND WE SEE THIS AS A REAL --

02:26:37.622 --> 02:26:38.422
OPPORTUNITY TO COLLABORATE

02:26:38.489 --> 02:26:39.724
BETWEEN AGRICULTURE AND

02:26:39.790 --> 02:26:41.526
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE TO MAKE

02:26:41.592 --> 02:26:42.860
SURE NOT CONVERTING --

02:26:42.927 --> 02:26:45.229
ATLANTA NECESSARILY AND INSTEAD

02:26:45.296 --> 02:26:46.464
ENCOURAGING --

02:26:46.531 --> 02:26:48.199
URBAN DEVELOPMENT THAT'S DANCE

02:26:48.266 --> 02:26:49.567
AND CENTERED AROUND.

02:26:49.634 --> 02:26:51.969
TOWN CENTERS AND ALSO FOCUSED ON

02:26:52.036 --> 02:26:53.638
TRANSIT AND ACTIVE

02:26:53.704 --> 02:26:54.272
TRANSPORTATION RATHER THAN ROAD

02:26:54.338 --> 02:26:56.240
EXPANSION --

02:26:56.307 --> 02:26:58.676
SO IF WE SEE THAT AS A ROOM FOR

02:26:58.743 --> 02:27:00.244
COLLABORATION --

02:27:00.311 --> 02:27:02.513
WE ALSO WANTED TO THINK --

02:27:02.580 --> 02:27:04.115
MANY OF WITH WHOM WERE HERE

02:27:04.182 --> 02:27:05.383
EARLIER TODAY --

02:27:05.449 --> 02:27:06.951
BUT THOSE WHO AND WITHIN

02:27:07.018 --> 02:27:08.419
AGRICULTURE THAT SUPPORTED THE

02:27:08.486 --> 02:27:08.986
SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING

02:27:09.053 --> 02:27:10.421
WATER ACT --

02:27:10.488 --> 02:27:12.423
WHICH WE SEE AS ESSENTIAL --

02:27:12.490 --> 02:27:13.391
TO SOLVING THE DRINKING WATER

02:27:13.457 --> 02:27:14.859
CRISIS THAT'S AFFECTING THE

02:27:14.926 --> 02:27:15.626
STATE.

02:27:15.693 --> 02:27:18.496
AND DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS

02:27:18.563 --> 02:27:20.898
ON DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES --

02:27:20.965 --> 02:27:21.933
WITH THAT SAID I THINK THERE'S A

02:27:21.999 --> 02:27:23.201
FEW THINGS THAT ARE MISSING FROM

02:27:23.267 --> 02:27:25.036
TODAY'S HEARING AND WE ASK FOR

02:27:25.102 --> 02:27:26.571
I'M A FOLLOW HEARING --

02:27:26.637 --> 02:27:29.273
WE'D LIKE TO ENGAGE IN A

02:27:29.340 --> 02:27:31.142
DISCUSSION OF DEFERRED

02:27:31.209 --> 02:27:32.510
IMPROVEMENTS THAT CAN BE MADE

02:27:32.577 --> 02:27:33.811
WITHIN AGRICULTURE --

02:27:33.878 --> 02:27:34.712
INCLUDING --

02:27:34.779 --> 02:27:36.514
THE ISSUE AREAS OF PESTICIDES

02:27:36.581 --> 02:27:38.382
DUST WATER QUALITY DEGRADATION

02:27:38.449 --> 02:27:40.251
AIR QUALITY DEGRADATION --

02:27:40.318 --> 02:27:42.420
AND DE TO THE EXTENT THOSE

02:27:42.486 --> 02:27:43.854
ISSUES ARE RELATED TO

02:27:43.921 --> 02:27:46.123
AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES --

02:27:46.190 --> 02:27:47.858
TO THAT AND THERE ARE SEVERAL

02:27:47.925 --> 02:27:49.727
POINTS THAT --

02:27:49.794 --> 02:27:50.294
WE'D LIKE FOR THE DISCUSSION

02:27:50.361 --> 02:27:51.896
AROUND --

02:27:51.963 --> 02:27:53.931
FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT

02:27:53.998 --> 02:27:55.166
AGRICULTURE ACCOUNTS FOR THE

02:27:55.233 --> 02:27:57.268
MAJORITY OF METHANE EMISSIONS IN

02:27:57.335 --> 02:27:58.336
THE STATE.

02:27:58.402 --> 02:27:59.704
AND THE ED DAIRY INDUSTRY

02:27:59.770 --> 02:28:01.572
ACCOUNT ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT 75%

02:28:01.639 --> 02:28:03.341
OF THOSE EMISSIONS.

02:28:03.407 --> 02:28:04.809
WERE CONCERNED WITH THE STATE'S

02:28:04.875 --> 02:28:06.277
GROWING RELIANCE ON VERY TIGHT

02:28:06.344 --> 02:28:07.678
JESTERS TO ADDRESS THIS

02:28:07.745 --> 02:28:11.249
IMPORTANT ISSUE --

02:28:11.315 --> 02:28:12.583
THE ESPECIALLY TO THE EXTENT

02:28:12.650 --> 02:28:15.186
THAT RELY ON PUBLIC SUBSIDIES --

02:28:15.253 --> 02:28:16.921
WE SEE THAT THIS IS A FAIRLY ON

02:28:16.988 --> 02:28:19.357
PROVEN METHOD --

02:28:19.423 --> 02:28:21.325
TO RESPONSE TO METHANE EMISSIONS

02:28:21.392 --> 02:28:23.728
FROM THE DAIRY INDUSTRY --

02:28:23.794 --> 02:28:25.329
AND THEY DID NOT ADDRESS RELATED

02:28:25.396 --> 02:28:26.264
AIR QUALITY AND WATER QUALITY

02:28:26.330 --> 02:28:27.365
CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE WITH

02:28:27.431 --> 02:28:28.666
RESPECT --

02:28:28.733 --> 02:28:29.800
TO THE INDUSTRY.

02:28:29.867 --> 02:28:31.669
IN FACT PUBLIC SUBSIDIES COULD

02:28:31.736 --> 02:28:32.770
EXASPERATED AND FOR

02:28:32.837 --> 02:28:34.772
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS FROM

02:28:34.839 --> 02:28:35.973
DAIRIES BY INCENTIVIZING

02:28:36.040 --> 02:28:37.742
INCREASED HER EXCISE.

02:28:37.808 --> 02:28:39.043
AND POTENTIALLY EXPANDING AN

02:28:39.110 --> 02:28:40.711
INDUSTRY THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT

02:28:40.778 --> 02:28:42.647
SOURCE CURRENTLY OF AIR QUALITY

02:28:42.713 --> 02:28:43.781
AND WATER QUALITY POLLUTION IN

02:28:43.848 --> 02:28:45.816
THE STATE --

02:28:45.883 --> 02:28:46.884
WITH RESPECT TO SPEAK

02:28:46.951 --> 02:28:48.452
SPECIFICALLY THE CLAIM THAT BY A

02:28:48.519 --> 02:28:50.588
METHANE DISCOURAGES THE USE OF

02:28:50.655 --> 02:28:52.890
DIESEL AND TRANSPORTATION.

02:28:52.957 --> 02:28:54.358
ARE WE KNOW THAT --

02:28:54.425 --> 02:28:55.926
MOST AT THAT PROJECTS HAVE BEEN

02:28:55.993 --> 02:28:58.062
FOCUSED ON GENERATION OF BIO

02:28:58.129 --> 02:28:59.230
METHANE.

02:28:59.297 --> 02:29:00.965
AND AT ADDING THAT BY MATH AND

02:29:01.032 --> 02:29:02.867
AND THINGS [inaudible]

02:29:02.933 --> 02:29:05.636
PIPELINES SO IT'S NOT REALLY

02:29:05.703 --> 02:29:07.972
FOCUSED ON TRANSPORTATION

02:29:08.039 --> 02:29:10.841
RELATED IMPACTS ARE AS OF YET --

02:29:10.908 --> 02:29:12.576
SO WE THINK THAT THOSE CLAIMS

02:29:12.643 --> 02:29:14.412
SHOULD BE REVIEWED CRITICALLY --

02:29:14.478 --> 02:29:15.546
AND THAT THERE ARE ALSO

02:29:15.613 --> 02:29:16.881
SIGNIFICANT UNKNOWNS REGARDING

02:29:16.947 --> 02:29:18.649
IMPACTS OF TERRY DI JESTERS

02:29:18.716 --> 02:29:20.584
WHICH WE HOPE TO WORK WITH THIS.

02:29:20.651 --> 02:29:22.453
COMMITTEE AND I AND OTHERS IN

02:29:22.520 --> 02:29:23.120
THE INDUSTRY TO BETTER

02:29:23.187 --> 02:29:24.021
UNDERSTAND --

02:29:24.088 --> 02:29:25.623
HOW TO MITIGATE ANYTHING RELATED

02:29:25.690 --> 02:29:27.591
TO THEIR DIGESTERS?

02:29:27.658 --> 02:29:28.659
WITH RESPECT IRRIGATED

02:29:28.726 --> 02:29:30.828
AGRICULTURE WE'D KNOW THAT AND

02:29:30.895 --> 02:29:32.496
THE TWENTY TWELVE STUDY PREPARED

02:29:32.563 --> 02:29:34.332
BY UC DAVIS WHICH WERE ALL

02:29:34.398 --> 02:29:36.434
FAMILIAR WITH LIKELY --

02:29:36.500 --> 02:29:37.668
ONE THIRD OF DOMESTIC WELLS IN

02:29:37.735 --> 02:29:38.836
THE TULARE LAKE BASIN IN THE

02:29:38.903 --> 02:29:40.137
SALINAS VALLEY EXCEEDED THE

02:29:40.204 --> 02:29:42.473
NITRATE MCO FOR DRINKING WATER.

02:29:42.540 --> 02:29:44.075
AND THAT SAME SET A STUDY

02:29:44.141 --> 02:29:46.077
CONCLUDED THAT 96% OF HUMAN

02:29:46.143 --> 02:29:48.546
GENERATED NITRATE IS SOURCED

02:29:48.612 --> 02:29:49.080
IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE AND

02:29:49.146 --> 02:29:50.481
DAIRIES.

02:29:50.548 --> 02:29:51.816
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT RIGHT

02:29:51.882 --> 02:29:52.917
CURRENT REGULATION HASN'T

02:29:52.983 --> 02:29:54.819
SUFFICIENTLY ADDRESSED.

02:29:54.885 --> 02:29:56.187
AND WE SEE.

02:29:56.253 --> 02:29:57.321
ROOM FOR BETTER REGULATION AND

02:29:57.388 --> 02:30:00.591
LEGISLATIVE SOLUTIONS --

02:30:00.658 --> 02:30:02.893
ADDITIONALLY THERE'S THE NITROUS

02:30:02.960 --> 02:30:04.862
OXIDE STUDY THAT WAS --

02:30:04.929 --> 02:30:06.530
COMPLETED THIS YEAR SHOWING

02:30:06.597 --> 02:30:08.866
AGRICULTURE CONTRIBUTES BETWEEN

02:30:08.933 --> 02:30:09.867
TWENTY FIVE AND 40% OF TOTAL

02:30:09.934 --> 02:30:12.436
KNOCKS EMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA.
