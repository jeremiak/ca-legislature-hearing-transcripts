THANK YOU MISLI REALLY APPRECIATED- YOU DID THAT IN RECORD TIME- I IMAGINE THAT MY `LEAGUES QUESTION OR TWO. SO LET ME SEE YES SENATOR LAYER GO AHEAD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MADAM CHAIR- EVEN THOUGH I'VE STUDIED THESE WHERE SOME THINGS ARE STILL CONFUSING BECAUSE THE WATER RESILIENCE SEASON ONE BUT THE THREE YEAR DROUGHT PACKAGES IN ANOTHER I THINK IT'S IN ONE FIFTY FIVE THEN MY QUESTION FOR FINANCES. THAT THE DROUGHT HAPPENS TO BE RIGHT NOW BUT THE DROP MONEY IS A YEAR FROM NOW. AND THERE ARE VARIOUS PROJECTS THAT WERE CONTEMPLATED. SUCH AS THE ONE I REFERENCE THIS MORNING IN ANOTHER MEETING. THE THERE ARE TWO HUGE RESERVOIRS IN SOUTHERN MONTEREY COUNTY- I THINK IT'S A HUNDRED DIST. BETWEEN THEM A 1-001-005-0000 ACRE FEET AND ONE'S AT 9% ONCE AT 14% AND THE VALVES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE RESERVOIRS ARE BROKEN THAT IS A DROUGHT PACKED THAT IS A DROUGHT PROJECT BUT THIS MONEY COULDN'T BE ACCESSED FOR TWELVE MONTHS. AND THEREFORE. MR MAGUIRE'S DISTRICT HAS FORT BRAGG IN MENDOCINO THEIR PLACES THROUGHOUT THE CENTRAL COAST THAT AREN'T ON THE DELTA THAT HAVE THIS AND YET THE MONEY IS A YEAR AWAY. MY QUESTION IS IF THE CRISIS CONTINUES TO BE A CUTE. FOR THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT CONSIDERED DEFICIENCY LETTER OR SOMETHING THAT ALLOWS THIS MONEY TO BE USED FOR THE CRISIS THAT WE'RE FACING NOW. BUT ISN'T BUDGETED FOR A YEAR FROM NOW. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION I MEAN I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THERE IS MULTIPLE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN CURRENT YEAR AS WELL AS THE OUT YEARS BUT I WILL TURN THIS QUESTION OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES- SERGIO ANGULAR. MORE DETAILS IN REGARDS TO THE SPECIFIC PART OF FINDING YOUR YOUR- ASKING ABOUT. IT SURE NUMBER THIRTY- I GO WITH THE PART OF FINANCE WHICH IS THAT THE CLARIFY SO THE WATER IS GOING TO DROP OFF PACKAGES ABOUT FIVE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS. IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO THERE'S THREE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS A LITTLE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY IS ACTUALLY PROGRAM IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AND- SO WE STRATEGICALLY PROGRAM THE DOLLARS WHERE- THE MAJORITY GOOD DROUGHT TOLERANCE UP ALREADY AND IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET. NOW ONE OF THE NUMBER THAT WE ADDED IN THE JUNE BUDGET WE HAD A CONTROL SECTION- THAT ALL RIGHT THAT ADDITIONAL TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS- FOR UNANTICIPATED DROUGHT EMERGENCY. SO WE HAVE SIMILAR TO LIKE A SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATION BUT THAT WAS ACTUALLY GET CALLED OUT WITHIN THE JUNE BUDGET FOR THAT INITIAL TWENTY FIVE MILLION SO. THEY CAN THEY'RE NEEDED THERE'S ADDITIONAL. FUNDING WE CAN TAP INTO THEIR CLASS JUST CLARIFYING IT ABOUT THREE POINT FIVE BILLION THAT WE DID PROGRAM- FOR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. NOT NOT SURE WHICH SPECIFIC PART OF FUNDING YOU'RE REFERENCING BUT THERE IS A- AS A POTENTIAL MAIL A PROGRAM- BUT I. LOOKED AT THE BREAK DOWN OF THE DEFERRED PROGRAMS THAT WERE LISTED I DON'T HAVE IT RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME RIGHT NOW IT'S IN ONE OF THESE. THEN IT FOR LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT MIGHT BE. OF THE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT ACT THE THERE'S A WHOLE HOST OF THINGS THAT ARE IN THAT BUT TARGETED TOWARD THE DROUGHT EMERGENCY SEEMS VERY NARROW. THERE WAS A SPECIFIC ITEM. THAT HAPPENED TO DO A CENTRAL COAST DROP RESILIENCY THAT GOT PUT IN THE OUT YEAR. END AND SO WHAT I'M DRIVING AT. IS I MEAN THERE'S AN INJECTION WELL AT WATER RECYCLING IN MONTEREY WHERE THERE. REALLY STUCK IN THE STATE IS ABOUT TO ORDER THEM TO CUT MORE. ARE THEY COULD GET MORE WATER THEY COULD UPGRADE WELLS IN SANTA CRUZ THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO GET MORE WATER. THE BIG. BASIN FIRE. DIST DESTROYED THE WAR ALONG FOR BIG BASS WATER. IN THOSE PEOPLE TO REBUILD OR THEIR ARE ABOUT OF ONE AND THERE'S A PART CAN. THAT NEEDS TO GO THERE'S THE VALVES IN THE PROJECTS THAT- IF THE SALINAS RIVER AND THE RED. ARE WAS JUST REFER TO. AND YOU LOOK AT THESE HEIGHTS. YOU HAVE NO WISH. THE DOES COME OF PROUD. APPLY FOR TWO AND YET THEY'RE GOING TO RUN OUT A WALL. AND SO WHAT I'M LOOKING AT IS NOT THAT THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY THERE FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT LINE ITEMS TELL ME HOW IT'S GOING TO BE REDIRECTED TO THE DROUGHT AND MEET THE NEEDS THAT ARE. THAT ARE URGENT AND GOING ON RIGHT NOW. YEAH IT'S ALL JUST GOING TO A FEW SPECIFIC POP THE FUNDING THAT WE DO HAVE A TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. FOR DROUGHT EARLIER THIS YEAR WE DID FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS- PER SMALLER SUPPLIERS- AND URBAN WHILE WATER MAGIC GRANTS. SPECIFICALLY TO FOCUS PURELY ON VALUE ISSUES. ON SIGMA WITH THE MONEY WE'RE ADDING NOW AND THE JUNE BUDGET THAT'S A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY. FIVE YOU COULD LIVE A CORE- SIGMA GRAFT- SWEEP IN ANOTHER PROGRAM WHICH WE KNOW ALSO HELPS- DURING DROUGHT ESPECIALLY AND FORMER SIDE. SO THAT'S UP FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SO. WE CAN. KIND OF SHOW YOU A BREAKDOWN OF ALL THE TWENTY ONE NO. I GET SOME OF THAT BREAK DOWN I MEAN I HAPPENED TO BE IN THE CABINET WHEN SIGNAL WAS ADOPTED CIGNA IS IT NECESSARILY A DRAFT PROGRAM. I STRONGLY SUPPORTED ONE WHAT'S IN THERE BUT- BUT- THE RECYCLING IF. IT WERE- AND THERE WAS ONE OTHER ISSUE THAT. OUR RISK RAISE CENTER WHITE HOUSE IS SPEAKING MY YEAR. WHICH IS THE THING THAT PROVIDES WATER IN AN EMERGENCY QUICKER THAN ANYTHING ELSE IS A WATER RECYCLING. AND WHEN THE WATER BOND WAS ADOPTED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. ARE THERE WAS EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY I BELIEVE MILLION DOLLARS- SUBSCRIBE IMMEDIATELY ACROSS THE STATE. AND IT PROVIDES WATER. IN IT IN A VERY. A DISPERSED MANNER ALL ACROSS THE STATE IS IN. D. NEGOTIATIONS ARE LET GO SHE ASIANS BUT THE NUMBER GOT DROPPED AND THEN. THERE IS ONE THING THAT WOULD PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WATER AND IT IS NOT THE FEATURED IN A MAJOR WAY IN THIS AND SO- I'M COGNIZANT OF THE FACT THIS IS A DEAL. IT'S DONE. HOME OR PASS THE AMENDMENT DEADLINE BUT THESE ARE NEEDS THAT ARE REAL AND ARE GOING AWAY AND SO- I DON'T THINK ANY OF THE SIGMA MONEY'S GOING TO GO TO DROUGHT RELIEF. BUT SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN WORK ON THIS AND THAT THERE'S SOME KIND OF. COMMITMENT THAT IF ALL THESE ARE IN CATEGORIES THAT DON'T WORK FOR WATER DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE. OR CITIES OR COUNTIES THAT ARE RUNNING OUT OF WATER. THERE'S A COMMITMENT TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND WORK WITH THE DISTRICTS AND DO A DEFICIENCY LETTER OR WHATEVER IT TAKES. BECAUSE I KNOW SOME OF IT THAT WAS MOST IMPORTANT TO ME GOT PUT ME OUT OF HERE WHEN THE DROUGHT IS NOW AND THAT'S THE THING THAT TRIGGERED THIS. BUT BUT IT'S JUST I'M LOOKING FOR. A DESIRE TO WORK TOGETHER BECAUSE PEOPLE IF WHAT I THINK YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT GONNA RAIN STORM THAT'S REMOTELY SIGNIFICANT TILL NOVEMBER COULD BE DECEMBER. AND PEOPLE OR IT'S JUST GOING TO GET PROGRESSIVELY WORSE. AND THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE NEEDS NOW AND IT HITS LOWER INCOME MORE REMOTE COMMUNITIES FIRST. AND THAT IS JUST GOING TO BE AN ISSUE SO I'VE SAID MY PIECE. BUT I'M GONNA BE LOOKING. FOR COOPERATE ON THIS PATH IF WE MOVE INTO THIS AND PEOPLE NEED HELP. THE PARDON ME CALL AND- ARE VERY SURE SENATOR NIELSEN AND- SENATOR GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR DIRECTED TO FINANCE. MY COLLEAGUE. FROM THE SANTA CLARA VALLEY WAS JUST ASKING A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS THAT ARE APPLICABLE AND I DON'T THINK WE'VE GOT THOSE ANSWERED THUS FAR SPECIFICALLY ENOUGH. WHAT THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO KNOW FOR SURE FROM FINANCE FROM THE GOVERNOR IS THAT AS WE THEN AFTER THE BUDGET. THAT DOES WONDERS WILL BE TIMELY EXPANDED. A INVESTIGATION DONE BY. PBS A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO DISCLOSED THAT SUBSTANTIAL DOLLARS THAT THE LEGISLATURE PUT IN THE BUDGET FOR WILDLAND MANAGEMENT. FIRE PREVENTION WAS NOT SPENT. WITH WITH HEALTH. AND I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHO THE AUTHORITY WAS THAT MADE THAT DETERMINATION. BUT THEN WE HAD SOME INSIGHT EARLY THIS YEAR AS THE BUDGET WAS SUBMITTED. SOME FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. WAS DIRECTED FOR THESE PURPOSES FOR SOMEONE OF LAND MANAGEMENT TO PREVENT THESE CATACLYSMIC FIRES. HOWEVER THE CABINET IN THE LANGUAGE ACTUALLY SAID. THAT IT HAD TO BE DETERMINED AS NEEDED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. NOW I'D- BEEN LED TO UNDERSTAND SUCH LANGUAGE IS NO LONGER IN THE BUDGET DIRECTOR OF FINANCE IS THERE ANY LANGUAGE. IN THE BUDGET. THAT WOULD ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OR ANYTHING AND EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO THE RESOURCES AGENCY TO NOT EXPAND THE DOLLARS THAT WE HAVE THEN APPROPRIATED. AND PROVIDED FOR IN THE BUDGET IS THERE ANY LANGUAGE THAT GIVES THE ADMINISTRATION THAT DISCRETION- THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER IN THE US AND I'LL TURN THAT OVER TO SERGIO REGULAR FOR SOME DETAILS. IF THEY'RE GENERALLY PART OF FINANCE- SO YOU'RE PREGNANT EARLIER THIS YEAR THAT WAS- THE THOUGHT THAT WE HAVE OR WE WERE PRETTY SEVEN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AND THEN WE WOULD PROVIDE THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE WITH AUTHORITY TO ACCELERATE. HOWEVER IN THIS BUDGET I WILL PRESENT TO YOU NOW WE'RE ACTUALLY APPROPRIATING THE ENTIRE AMOUNT TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. FOUR NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. AND THERE IS NO. ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY THAT WE HAVE TO THE MOVE THAT BACK- WITHOUT ANY KIND OF FUTURE LEGISLATION. AND SO THAT THAT- KIND OF- KIND OF THOUGHT THAT WE HAD BACK IN JUNE. IF. NOT WE'LL MOVE FORWARD WITH ITS BUDGET. WELL THAT THAT CERTAINLY IS HELPFUL SIR AND- I KNOW WE ALL WILL APPRECIATE THAT. SOMEWHAT OF A CONCERN THEN IS THAT THIS BUDGET IS PROVIDING MONEY OVER SEVERAL YEARS. AND THE LACK OF SPECIFICITY IS OF CONCERN. SO HOW WILL THIS BE MONITORED AND REPORTED TO THE LEGISLATURE I DON'T WANT I WOULD COME BACK NEXT YEAR AS THE BUDGET IS SUBMITTED AND SAY WELL THIS IS WHERE WE'RE AT NOW THIS IS HOW MUCH WE SPENT. WE NEED TO HAVE SOME REGULAR UPDATING OF THE EXPENDITURES IN THE ABORTION MUCH AROUND CALIFORNIA TO THESE NECESSARY PROJECT WHICH MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE SANTA CLARA VALLEY JUST OUTLINED A NUMBER OF IN THE AREA THAT HE- REPRESENTS AND INDEED THE POST. AND OTHER SENATORS FROM THE NORTH IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THEY HAVE THEIR OFFICES WELL WE NEED TO KNOW THAT THOSE ARE BEING ATTENDED. TO WHAT ASSURANCE CAN YOU GIVE US THE MONEY THAT WE WOULD VOTE AND THIS BUDGET. IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE TIMELY LED OUT. INTO THE COMMUNITIES AND I SEE THAT WE DO HAVE SOME SPECIFIC THAT SPECIFIC. PURPOSES OR ENTITIES THAT MONIES CAN GO TO. BUT HOW WOULD YOU KEEP TRACK OF THAT AND REPORT IT TO THE LEGISLATURE. A THIRD PARTY FINANCE SO SPECIFICALLY ON THE WILDFIRE AND FOR RELIEF PACKAGE. WE ACTUALLY HAVE- CREDIBLE LANGUAGE I WAS INCLUDED THAT- MANDATES ANNUAL REPORTING- FROM THE ADMINISTRATION TO THE LEGISLATURE- ON ALL OF THE WALL PART BENCHERS. AS A PART OF THAT THERE WILL BE ANY REPORTING OVER I BELIEVE THAT THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. WATCH THE TRAILER BILL AUTHORIZED. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THAT ARE LITERALLY OUT OF WATER. IS MONEY HAVE PROVIDED HERE TO ALL THE S. TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE MONEY OF MONEY FOR. WATER TO BE DELIVERED POTABLE WATER TO SOME OF THESE COMMUNITIES SO THEY CAN JUST LITERALLY SURVIVE. WE'VE BEEN HAVING THE KIND OF FACILITATE IN OUR OWN DISTRICTS DOWN EXCHANGES OF WATERFORD CITY I'VE GOT GROOVE ONE CITY TO ANOTHER CITY. WHAT WHAT'S THE PROVISIONS IN THE BUDGET AND THE INTENT OF FINANCE TO ENSURE THAT MONIES THAT ARE NEEDED JUST FOR LIVING. ARE GOING TO BE DIRECTED TIMELY. THROUGH AND THROUGH OUR AGENCY WHAT DEPARTMENT WOULD IT BE- YES. HELLO AGAIN SIR JOHN NEVER PART OF FINANCE- THERE'S A COUPLE DEPARTMENT THAT COULD POTENTIALLY- PROVIDE SUPPORT THERE AND WE ACTUALLY DID INCLUDE FUNDING AND- THAT THEY WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD BUDGET FOR EMERGENCY DRINKING WATER NEEDS- AND THEN I SPOKE TO A LITTLE BIT EARLIER ON. A CONTROLLED SECTION THAT WE DID ADD AND- DATES JUNE BUDGET THAT PROVIDED ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY FOR THESE TYPES OF EMERGENCY DRINKING WATER NEEDS AND CALLAWAY HAS ALSO DOES PLAY A ROLE- AND- ALSO THROUGH CDA WHICH THEY COULD AUTHORIZE FOR SOME OF THE- EMERGENCY DRINKING WATER NEEDS THAT SO THERE'S KIND OF MULTIPLE- VENUES AND DEPARTMENT. THAT. BECAUSE THE POOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES OR NEED. THE WILD FIRES ARE OCCURRING THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. NORTH SOUTHEAST WEST THE VALLEYS. IT ISN'T JUST THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH- BURNING WHEN THE SANTA ANA WINDS BLOW OR WHEN WE HAVE THESE HEAVY FIRES UP IN THE NORTH. SO. WHAT F. WHAT'S YOUR BUDGET AND MAYBE ONE SEVENTY. AND IT SAYS THE GOAL IS TO TREAT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES A YEAR. WELL HAS THE RESOURCES AGENCY PROVIDED A SCHEDULE. AND I KNOW SOME OF OUR MEMBERS ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THE ADJACENT DISTRICT IN THE NORTH HAS DONE A LOT OF INVENTORYING WORK OF FOUR SHOVEL READY PROJECTS. THE RESOURCES AGENCY. HAVE THEY DONE THAT AS WELL. IDENTIFIED THE NECESSARY AND HIGHEST PRIORITY PROJECTS FOR MONIES TO BE DIRECTED TO FOR A WHILE AND MANAGEMENT. SO WHAT THEY ARE ALTHOUGH THE COUPLE THINGS AS FAR AS THE EARLY ACTION PACKAGE THAT- WE PASSED EARLIER THIS YEAR WE'VE ACTUALLY WARDED- 85% OF THAT FUNDING WE HAVE PROJECT LISTS. THAT WE HAVE THAT WE COULD SHARE OF ALL THE DIFFERENT PROJECTS THAT WERE HIGH PRIORITY BACK RECEIVED FUNDING UNDER THAT- AND AS PART OF THIS ADDITIONAL AUGMENTATION WE'RE PROVIDING THAT NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS- I THINK THAT PERSPECTIVE THAT WE HAVE IS. TO DO LARGER MORAL LANDSCAPE SCALE TYPE PROJECTS- THAT COULD PROVIDE FUNDING TO THE SUPPORT OF THAT PROJECT FOR A FOR A COUPLE YEARS AND SO I KNOW THAT- YOU KNOW CAL FIRE AND- AND MYSTERY AGENCIES- WORK WITH-WITH THE REGION'S WORK WITH THE LOCALS. WHO YOU KNOW ARE PRINTING OTHER PLANS TO IDENTIFY THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROJECTS AND PART OF THE FUNDING THAT WE HAVE HERE IS ALSO FOR A PROGRAM THAT IS PART OF CONSERVATION RUNS. TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR LOCALS TO DEVELOP THOSE A PIPELINE OF PROJECTS AND SO YOU KNOW STATEWIDE APPROACH ORIGINALLY LEAD SO I THINK THAT'S THAT'S A BIG ASPECT OF THIS. RULE THAT WE HAVE. WELL LAST. QUESTION THEN FOR THE MOMENT. THE MANY THAT HAVE BEEN SO DECIMATED. IN PAST DISASTERS AND I'M THINKING PARTICULAR PARADISE OR IN FACT THE ORVILLE DAM SPILLWAY FAILURE. AGENCIES HAVE COME TO THE HELP OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THE STATE WAS PARTICULARLY HELPFUL TO PARADISE. AT LEAST AT THE FRONT END. ARE YOU POKER SING ON THOSE MOST NEEDED AND TIRES PRIORITY AREAS THAT NEED SOME HELP TO ALLOW THE CITIZENS TO REESTABLISH THEIR COMMUNITIES THEIR OWN LIVELIHOODS AND HOMES. I MEAN IF I GET THAT QUESTION OVER T SERGIO- FOR FURTHER DETAILS. I THINK YOU IF YOU EVER THINK THAT TYPE OF PROJECT THAT WE WOULD FIND UNDER THE UNDER THE ESTOPPEL WE ARE FOCUSED ON KIND OF MORE OF THOSE YOU KNOW HI I'M FIRE RISK AREAS AFTER THAT IS- ONE OF THE KEY FOCUSES OF. THE CRITERIA WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE GRAPH OF PROGRAMS WITH MR. I WOULD THEN ASK. THE MANAGER I'LL- DEFER AFTER THIS QUESTION. THE TOP KIND OF A LITTLE BIT AGO ABOUT MAYBE HAVING A SCHEDULE OF THINGS THAT YOU WERE GOING TO BE SPENDING MONEY ON. COULD YOU MAKE A COMMITMENT TO THE LEGISLATORS THAT YOU WOULD KINDLY PROFFERED THOSE DOCUMENTS OF YOUR PRIORITIES TO THE LEGISLATURE SO THAT WE AT LEAST COULD THEN REVIEW THEM AND- HAVE OUR INPUT. AS TO WHAT WE THINK BOTH PRIORITY SHOULD BE. BUT I THINK IF YOU'RE GOING BACK TO MY EARLIER COMMENT WHERE A PART OF THIS PRINTER BILL ACTUALLY REQUIRES US TO REPORT ANNUALLY ON ALL THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROJECTS- TO THE LEGISLATURE THAT WE ARE FUNDING WITH. SOME OF THE PROJECTS- AND JUST SOME SOME OF THE OUTCOMES AND SO THAT WILL BE PART OF OUR ANNUAL REPORTING TO THE LEGISLATURE WHERE YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO VIEW- ALL THE DIFFERENT PROJECTS THAT ARE BEING AWARDED- WITHIN THIS PACKAGE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON LET MELIST TOO I HAVE HERE I HAVE A CENTER GROVE SENATOR DOLLY SENATOR COM LOCKER SENATOR DRAWS SO. SENATOR IN. NASSERITE CASKEY. K. WORKERS CAME IN OKAY. SENATOR GROSS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I DO- OKAY I'LL KEEP MY QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS BRIEF BECAUSE I KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF MY ACCEPT THEM BUT I DO HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS AND I APOLOGIZE FOR HAVING A FIVE. BUT AN EIGHTY ONE SEVENTY THE WILDFIRE FUNDING EITHER FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR THE L. A. L. IN OUR FIRST OUR FORESTS ARE BURNING UP ALL AROUND US AND IT'S EVIDENT THAT STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS AND- NEED TO DO A LOT MORE TO PREVENT WILDFIRE LAND MANAGEMENT THINGS LIKE THAT. AS A STATE WE HAVE A GOAL TO TREAT ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES PER YEAR AND HOW MANY ACRES DO YOU ESTIMATE CAN BE TREATED WITH THE FUNDS PROVIDED IN THIS BUDGET I'M JUST YOU KNOW I DON'T. WE DON'T SEE BILLS LIKE HOW MUCH IT COSTS TO TREAT THESE ACRES AND SERVE DOES ANYBODY HAVE AN IDEA- HOW MUCH OF A- IT WILL COST TO TREAT THESE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES AND IS THERE ENOUGH MONEY IN THE BUDGET FOR THAT. THANK YOU SENATOR GROVER THAT QUESTION- I'LL TURN IT OVER TO BECOME MORE OR RESPOND. I DON'T WANT TO PUT IN A FINANCE THANKS FOR THE QUESTION- UNFORTUNATELY THAT THAT GOOGLE THE ACRES IT'S HARD TO PREDICT BECAUSE SO MUCH OF THAT GOING OUT IN- GRANT DOLLARS BUT I CAN ASSURE THAT- IN. TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY WE DIFFERENT INITIAL NUMBERS IN BETWEEN A HUNDRED AND FIVE THOUSAND ACRES. I WE DON'T YET HAVE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUT WE EXPECTED TO INCREASE DRAMATICALLY BUT THE EARLY ACTION PLANS THAT JUST CAME IN AND THEN INCREASE FROM THERE WITH THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING- OKAY. THANK YOU M. AN ON AGAIN ON EIGHTY ONE SEVENTY AT GIVEN THE STATE'S COMMITMENT TO A FORTY FIVE THERE WAS FOUR MILLION DOLLARS A ONE TIME EXPENDITURES IN THE BUDGET THAT WE HAD IN JUNE AND- I THINK WE DID THAT OR AT LEAST IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING WE DID THAT BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES WHEN WE DO THINGS LIKE THIS- IT CAUSES OUR RATES FOR CALIFORNIANS UNDER UTILITY BILLS TO GO UP THERE'S ADDITIONAL COST AND RATE PAYERS. THIS FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WOULD HAVE ELIMINATED SOME OF THAT FOR RATE PAYERS THAT PAY THE HIGHEST UTILITYRATES- ALMOST IN THE NATION AND- I NOTICED THAT MANY IS GONE NOW THAT THIS BUDGET TROLL DELETES THAT FUNDING IS THERE. A REASON FOR THAT. SENATOR GROPED FOUR HUNDRED MILLION FOR. WHAT WAS THAT- THE ITEM. AND IT WAS IN EIGHTY ONE SEVENTEEN IT WAS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND WHICH INCLUDED THE JUNE BUDGET FOR CLEAN ENERGY PROJECTS- SEEM LIKE A PRUDENT INVESTMENT BUT THAT MANY IS NOW GONE. WITH THIS BUDGET TRAILER BILL SO I WAS JUST CURIOUS WHY. AND NUMBER AFTER. FOUR HUNDRED MILLION FOR CLIMATE ADAPTATION PROJECTS. MMHM OKAY- IF THAT WAS PART OF THE TRANSPORTATION- PACKAGE THAT WAS PART OF THE JUNE- DEAL HOWEVER IT WAS CONTINGENT ON AN ALLOCATION SCHEDULE BEING PROVIDED BY THE LEGISLATURE BY OCTOBER TENTH- AND IF THERE IS NO LEGISLATION ENACTED THOSE FUNDS WILL REVERT BACK SO THAT WAS PART OF A BROADER. TRANSPORTATION PACKAGE- THAT IS STILL UNDER DISCUSSION SO DISCUSSIONS ARE SURROUND SURROUNDING- HIGH PRIORITY TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS ARE STILL UNDER WAY AND HOPE TO COME BACK TO THAT IN JANUARY. THANK YOU MA'AM THANK YOU FOR THAT RESPONSE AND ANOTHER QUESTION I HAD AN EIGHTY ONE SEVENTY AS WELL THE BUDGET BILL JUNIOR IS COVERT NINETEEN TESTING HOW THE EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDING- FOR SCHOOL BASEMENT COVERED NINETEEN TESTING BE ALLOCATED. O BASED ON SCHOOL POPULATION IS THERE A FORMULA IS IT JUST GOING TO GO TO CERTAIN COUNTIES- YEAH THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES IN EDUCATION UNIT FOR SOME MORE DETAILS. THANK YOU. HI THIS IS WHAT I LOOK FOR MONDAY GUESS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THIS IS PROBABLY A- A CALIFORNIA. DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH QUESTION- SO THE EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION- THAT SAYING. HE WON SEVENTY IS FOR- KOBE TESTING IN SCHOOLS AND SO THIS FUNDING HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO- ALL SCHOOLS AS OF THIS SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE- SO. THE SCHOOLS HAVE TO- TAKE SOME- THEY HAVE TO TAKE SOME A FEW STEPS TO BE ABLE TO- ACCESS THE FUNDING BUT- IT HAS BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO ALL HAVE PUBLIC SCHOOLS CHARTER SCHOOLS- AS WELL AS PRIVATE SCHOOLS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT INFORMATION ON AB ONE SEVENTY ONE I THINK THIS WOULD BE HIS HEALTH FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND- WHICH ENTITY WILL DO THE INDEPENDENT NETWORK- ADEQUACY ANALYSIS ON INTEGRATED HOUSING SUPPORT SERVICES INTO MEDIC COW. THANK YOU SENATOR THAT'S ALSO A QUESTION OUT FOR ME AGAIN WHEN I LOOK AT MY TICKETS BUT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THE EVALUATION THAT YOUR- QUESTION IS ABOUT WILL BE CONDUCTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. OKAY THANK YOU AND MY LAST QUESTION IS ON AB ONE SIXTY TO THE COMMUNITY ECONOMIC RESILIENCE FUND GRANT CRITERIA- I'M JUST CURIOUS WHO DETERMINES HOW OR WHO IS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY COVERT NINETEEN MEANS AND WHO'S ELIGIBLE FOR THE GRANTS WHO DETERMINES THAT I CAN'T FIND ANYTHING IN THE LANGUAGE THAT. NAMES I AM. AN IDIOT COMMITTEE A AGENTS FROM SO JUST CURIOUS. THANK YOU FOR THAT- CENTER GROVE I KNOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN THIS FIND- I'M GONNA TURN THIS QUESTION OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE PATRICK TOPPING WHO HAS SOME. DETAILS THAT I BELIEVE THE DEFINITION- AS WELL THANK YOU. HI PATRICK TOPPING DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SO THE TREND IS DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY SO IN NINETEEN IS A FEDERALLY DEFINED TERM AND IT'S INCLUDING LANGUAGE TO ALIGN WITH THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACTING GUIDANCE. AS BEING PROMULGATED- BUT THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND MINISTER THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ADMINISTRATION RELEASED A NOTICE FUNDING AVAILABILITY TO DETERMINE EVERY REGION IN THE U. S. AND AFFECT MY CODE AND SO EVERYTHING. THESE FUNDS. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH TAKE THE TIME TO ANSWER MY QUESTIONS I HOPE THEY WEREN'T TOO LONG AND- I'LL TURN IT OVER TO THE CHAIR AGAIN TO CALL ON THAT ONE OF OUR OTHER. FIFTEEN COLLEAGUES THAT HAS- MIKE UP. THANK YOU SENATOR GROVE WHO MAY GO TO SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU ADAM CHARM I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR FINANCE I HAVE JUST I WANT TO RECAP ON. WHAT'S HAPPENED OVER THE LAST YEAR I SAID ON SEPT TWO AND- WE DID THE EARLY ACTION FIRE MONEY. AND WE WANTED TO GET THOSE THAT MONEY OUT SO WE COULD ACTUALLY DO PROJECTS IN OUR COMMUNITIES TO HELP. FEND OFF WHICH WE KNEW WAS COMING THE FIRE. AND TODAY WE BURN ABOUT A MILLION ACRES JUST IN MY DISTRICT ALONE. SO DURING BEFORE THE BREAK THE FIRES WERE STARTED BEFORE WE ARE. RECESS AND WE PASSED MORE LEGISLATION TO IN THE BUDGET BILL AND WE TALKED ABOUT. THIS BILL THE TRAILER BILL CLEAN UP LEGISLATION FOR FIRE. SO OVER THE BREAK I ACTUALLY DID SOME RESEARCH IN BETWEEN WATCHING MY- COMMUNITIES BURNED OUT. AND I FOUND THAT THERE WAS FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS WITH THE PROJECT AND I HAVE THE LIST RIGHT HERE IN MY HAND. AND IT'S NOT PROJECTS IN MY DISTRICT IT'S PROJECTS ALL OVER CALIFORNIA. THEY'RE IN EVERYONE IN YOUR DISTRICT. I MAY HAVE TREES YOU MAY HAVE CHAPARRAL. BUT OUR COMMUNITIES WILBUR IF WE DO NOT DO SOMETHING WITH EDUCATION MANAGER THESE ARE. MIND YOU SHOVEL READY PROJECTS SO I SUBMITTED THESE. LESS TO THE BUDGET CHAIRS I SUBMITTED THEM TO. THE SUB TWO MEMBERS I SUBMITTED THEM TO THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE THIS PLACE WORK. AND I'M ON. THE WRONG SIDE OF THE AISLE TO GET THINGS DONE BECAUSE- EVEN THOUGH I SUBMITTED ALL THESE PROJECTS. IN THE BILITY GET THE MONEY ON THE GROUND TO GET IT DONE. THIS WILL HAPPEN. SO WE HAVE A PROCESS THAT SET OUT THE WE ARE IN A BUDGET HEARING TODAY. AND WE'RE GONNA LISTEN TO THE PUBLIC. AND WE'RE GONNA TAKE THEIR TESTIMONY WHICH- I BELIEVE DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING BECAUSE- IF I HAVE A LEGISLATOR CAN'T GET. THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT. IN A WAY TO AMEND BILLS SO THAT WE ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING ON HE GROUND I DON'T KNOW HOW THE PUBLIC CAN EVER INFLUENCES PLACE. TODAY I WANTED TO SHARE SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT. WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND I WANT TO SHARE. WHAT WE FAILED OUR STATE. WITH POLICY NUMBER. ONE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TREATING A HALF A MILLION ACRES. THE CAL FIRE FOLKS COUNT ACRES THAT'S TREATED BETTER TIMBER HARVEST PLANS WHICH PRIVATE COMPANIES DO ON THEIR OWN LAND. WE ASKED HIM THAT IN SUB TWO AND THEY SAID THAT'S TRUE THAT'S PROPERTIES THAT DIDN'T COST THE STATE A DIME ACTUALLY WE MADE MONEY OFF OF THEM. AND THAT'S ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES. AS I'VE WATCHED MY CAN SO WE WHEN WE REALLY TALK ABOUT TREATING ACRES AND WHAT MONIES WERE SPENDING ON IT THEY'RE COUNTING ACRES THAT THEY DON'T EVEN SPEND A DIME ON IS ARE TREATED ACRES TOOK THE NARROW IT DOWN TO LOOK AT ABOUT A MONEY WE'RE SPENDING. ON ACRES IT'S A LOT HIGHER. COST. SO I'M ATTEMPTING TO TRY TO. GET OBJECTS DONE FIRE SAFETY PROJECTS DONE AROUND COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. SO WE DON'T BURN OUR COMMUNITIES DOWN. NOW WE ALL KNOW THAT THE EIGHTH WONDER OF THE WORLD WAS ALMOST ON PAR WHICH I CALL TAHOE. I REPRESENT ALL OF LAKE TAHOE. AND WHEN THE FIRE CAME OVER THE RIDGE. AND INTO THE VALLEY THERE WAS A FIRE BREAK THERE WE HAVE BEEN DOING SOME FIRE BREAKS AROUND THE LAKE IN THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS SINCE THE ANGORA FIRE. WE WERE ABLE TO BACK FIRE AT THE FIRE BREAKING ACTUALLY TURN THE FIRE AND SAVE. LAKE TAHOE. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT GREENVILLE WOULD LOOK LIKE IF WE HAD A FIRE SAFETY. AROUND THAT COMMUNITY WE WOULD STILL HAVE A COMMUNITY THERE. SO I HAVE AMENDMENTS MADAM CHAIR THAT I WANT TO PROPOSE I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS PROCESS WORKS I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE BUT I HAVE AN IMAGE THAT I WANT. THE BUDGET TO REFLECT THAT IF THERE'S A PART OF A PROJECT THAT IS AVAILABLE WHAT THAT MEANS THAT SEQUEL A- NEPA APPROVED PROJECTS. THAT WE FIND THEM NOT. THROUGH CAL FIRE WHO IS BUSY FIGHTING FIRE. OR IF IT IS THROUGH CAL FIRE THAN THEY HAVE TO GET THE FUNDS OUT. BY THE PROP THE PROJECTS THAT ARE. DEEPER AND SEEK A- SHOVEL READY PROJECTS THAT WE FIND THEM. THEY BE DEFENDED BY FEBRUARY ONE JANUARY ONE OF NEXT YEAR SO THAT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE PLANNING THESE PROJECTS ACTUALLY GET THE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND GETTING DONE SO THAT. NEXT YEAR OR NOT STARTING IN JANUARY WE'RE STARTING OUT WE HAVE THE MONEY IN THIS BUDGET DOES NOT DIRECT THE POLICY TO GET THOSE DONE SO I'VE SUBMITTED THE MINUTES TO EVERYONE YOUR DESK. THAT WE SHOULD PUT IN THE LANGUAGE THAT ALLOWS US TO GET THESE PROJECTS DONE. I JUST I DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO GO. I'VE TALKED ON THIS FLOOR ABOUT FIRE SINCE THE TIME I CAME TO THIS LEGISLATURE AND TRIED TO EDUCATED THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY. ONE THING THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY DO TO STOP FIRE THAT'S TAKE THE FUEL WAY AT LEAST AROUND OUR COMMUNITIES. AS I WATCHED MILLIONS OF ACRES AND HABITAT AND WILDLIFE AND WATERSHEDS AND CARBON SPEW- OUT OF. CALIFORNIA AND WE DON'T DO GOOD POLICY SO I'M JUST BAKING. TO DO THE RIGHT THING. TRY TO GO BACK TO MY COMMUNITIES AND THE OTHER SENATORS THAT REPRESENT THESE COMMUNITIES. AND SAY. YOU KNOW WHAT WE CAN GET IT DONE. THE GOVERNOR SAID WE DID NINETY THOUSAND ACRES AND WE REALLY ONLY DID NINE. CAL FIRE SAYING WE DO ALL THESE ACRES AND THEY DIDN'T REALLY DO IT THE PRIVATE PEOPLE DID IT BECAUSE OUR TEACH PEACE. LET'S DO SOME MAKERS LET'S TREAT IT WE HAVE THE RESOURCES WE HAVE THE MONEY WE HAVE THE PEOPLE TO DO IT AND THEY'RE ALREADY SHOVEL READYPROJECTS SO. MANAGER I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROCESS BUT I HAVE THESE MOMENTS AND I WOULD REQUEST THAT WE VOTE ON THESE AMENDMENTS. AT WHATEVER WHATEVER THE DELIVERY TIME IS THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY THE- IT IS NOT REALLY APPROPRIATE TO TAKE AMENDMENTS AT THIS POINT. BECAUSE THE WAIVERS WE APPROVED WERE FOR SPECIFIC BILLS IN SPECIFIC TIME PERIOD AND WE ARE PAST THAT TIME PERIOD- FIVE. ONE ONE MOMENT ONE MOMENT- THE- I APPRECIATE THAT YOU ARE FRUSTRATED- IN AN- NOT NOT THAT IT DIMINISHES IT BUT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE. PRODUCT KEY ISSUES IN WHAT N. FRUSTRATION ABOUT THE FINDING IN PAST BUT WHAT I WANTED TO CLARIFY IS THAT IN THIS SECTION THAT WE'RE IF IT'S TO MEAN HAT WE APPROVE IT. TONIGHT THERE IS FIFTY MILLION THAT IS GOING TO RECKLESSLY TO SIERRA NEVADA CONSERVANCY. ADDITIONALLY THERE IS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION FOR FIRE PREVENTION GRANTS. YOU'RE CORRECT THAT IT DOES NOT GO IT IS NOT ALREADY SPECIFIED FOR WHICH FIRE COUNSELOR FIRE SAFETY COUNCIL HOWEVER. THEY ARE ELIGIBLE TO APPLY AND IF THEY HAVE SHOVEL READY PROJECTS THEY WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVE THAT MONEY IMMEDIATELY AND AS YOU POINTED OUT. THERE WAS A FIRE BREAK THANK GOODNESS AROUND TAHOE YES IT WOULD BE OBVIOUSLY. A GREATLY IMPROVED HAVE FIRE BREAKS AROUND ALL OF OUR AREAS THAT ARE. IN THREAT OF WILDFIRE HOWEVER I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HARD FOR ALL OF US TO ANTICIPATE THE BASICALLY ALMOST EVERYWHERE IN THE STATE. THE THREAT OF WILDFIRE NOW- SO IF I MAY YES GO AHEAD SENATOR GOING. SO WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME IS THAT. OVER LABOR DAY WEEKEND. THESE BILLS WERE AMENDED ON MONDAY LABOR DAY. THAT THERE'S NO OPPORTUNITY TO AMEND THESE BILLS IN A IN A- BUDGET COMMITTEE THIS IS A COMMITTEE THIS ISN'T. SO WHY IS THE PUBLIC THEN GONNA CALL AND COMMENT ON ANY OF THESE BILLS BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO INFLUENCE OVER THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO. AFFECT THE LEGISLATION I WOULD SHARE WITH EVERYBODY THAT'S WATCHING YOU DON'T NEED TO CALL IN BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO IF THE IF THE SENATOR CAN'T. REMEMBER OR HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEN THAT NOBODY DOES SENATOR DOLLY WE WILL ENTERTAIN THE MOTION- AND I EIGHT. FIVE NOT TRYING TO BE RUDE HERE BUT I WOULD LIKE TO JUST POINT OUT THAT. THE- THE BILLS BEFORE US LAST WEEK TO NOT ONLY SCHEDULE THIS HEARING FOR TO ALSO ALLOW US TO AMEND BILLS WERE OPPOSED BY YOUR COLLEAGUES ON THE FLOOR HOWEVER. WE WILL ALLOW YOU TO MAKE THE MOTION ON THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU'VE DISTRIBUTED. SO YOU WANT TO MAKE THEM YES I WOULD BE HAPPY TO MAKE THAT OKAY DO I NEED TO READ MY MINUTES IS SO YOU DON'T NEED TO READ THEM THEY ARE IN WRITING HERE EVERYONE HAS THEM- SENATORS SENATOR DOLE HE'S MAKING A MOTION ON THOSE AMENDMENTS YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU. AND HE IS CLEARLY ASKING FOR AN I. VOTE SO. GO AHEAD SEND IF I MAY THE PUBLIC HAS NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE VOTING ON BECAUSE IT'S JUST IN FRONT OF THE MEMBERS. I THINK THE PUBLIC HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO KNOW SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO KNOW WHAT WERE EITHER UP OR DOWN SUMMARIZED CAN YOU BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE FIVE SURELY CAN'T THANK YOU. CERTAINLY MY MEASUREMENTS WOULD ALLOW. FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FORTUNE FIVE REJECTION TO ESTABLISH AND ADMINISTER GRANTS TO CONSERVANCIES FIRE SAFE COUNCILS AND COUNTY GOVERNMENTS AND THAT ARE HAVE SHOVEL READY PROJECTS WHAT I STATED EARLIER THAT MEANS. FIRE SAFE COUNCILS- OUR CD'S. AND IT ALSO HAS IN THE SECOND PART OF THE AMENDMENT IT HAS THE LEGISLATION TO TAKE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO THE FROM THE GENERAL FUND MONIES FOR THE WELFARE PREVENTION WE- RESILIENCE ACTIVITIES SO BASICALLY WHAT I'M ASKING YOU. TO DO IS BUY IN AND IT HAS TO BE DONE BY. DESCENT BY THE END OF THE YEAR FOR PROJECT STARTING NEXT YEAR THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THIRD SO SENATOR DOLLY IS- ASKING FOR NO VOTE ON THOSE AMENDMENTS- I WOULD ONLY AS I PREVIOUSLY POINTED OUT THAT. THE- THE HIS AMENDMENT IS ASKING FOR A DIFFERENT AGENCY TO ADMINISTER WELL TO ADMINISTER A LARGER PORTION OF FUNDS IN THIS AND WHAT WORKS FOR US BUT WE DO HAVE CAL FIRE. IN THIS BILL THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US WITH THE ABILITY TO FIND THEIR SHOVEL READY PROJECTS WITH THE TWO EXACTLY THE SAME ENTITIES THAT SENATOR DOLE A POINTED OUT SO- I WILL BE VOTING NO ON THOSE AMENDMENTS. AND WE CARE AND HAVE A ROLL CALL. THE SENATOR WHITE HOUSE CAN GO AHEAD. CAN WE HAVE A- CLARIFICATION BECAUSE THE AMENDMENTS BEFORE US ARE TALKING ABOUT- THE EXISTING UNDER EXISTING LAW- THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OFFICE. WILL AUTHORIZES FIVE HUNDRED. MILLION DOLLARS STACK WAS. APPROPRIATED EARLIER. THE LANGUAGE IN- AV ONE SEVENTY NOW MAKES THAT A FULL PART OF THE BUDGET SO IT'S NOT WE'RE NOT. TETHERED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SAYING YES YOU CAN USE THIS MONEY ALL THAT MONEY'S THERE SO. PEOPLE UNDERSTAND IT'S- IT IS NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT IN THE BUDGET RIGHT NOW NOT DEPENDENT ON ANYTHING FOR THE PAT AND FINANCE TO DO. I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT CLARIFICATION. RIGHT THANK YOU FOR THAT. CLARIFICATION- SENDER WORKOUTS SKI- RIGHT THE SENATOR NEWMAN AT THANK YOU AND YOUR DAD I'M NOT SURE IF THIS PROGRAM WOULD- IS IT POSSIBLE TO HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE COMMENT ON THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS BEFORE YOU GO. THE FIRM WE CERTAINLY CAN- MISLEAD YOU WANNA MAKE A COMMENT. YEAH I THINK GENERALLY SPEAKING IT IS DIFFICULT TO MAKE A COMMENT HAVING JUST HEARD THE AMENDMENTS- AND I CAN CONTRIVE DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE SERGIO FOR ANY PARTICULARS BUT I THINK AT THIS POINT WE WOULDN'T FEEL- WE'RE IN A POSITION TO MAKE THAT COMMENT- THE PROPOSED PLAN THAT WE HAVE IN OUR BUDGET IS AGREED UPON PLAN THAT- IS WHAT. THE PARKS. YES SIR I GOT A PART OF FINANCE YEAH HE JUST- THE KIND OF REITERATE MISSED LEAVE COMMENTS WE DON'T HAVE TO BE ABOUT IT SO WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE BUT I'D BE JUST BASED OFF OF- WITHIN OR WITHOUT HE WAS MENTIONING IT IF IT'S UNENDING THAT PROVISION OF THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION A CALIBRATION THAT PROVISION IS NOT REALLY- THAT LITTLE WAY MORE BECAUSE ALL OF IT'S APPROPRIATE. TO ALL RIGHT LET'S THE- LET'S HAVE A VOTE ON THE AMENDMENTS- MR STEPPING SHOCK COULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MOTION TO AMEND. A. B. ONE SEVENTY SENATORS SCANNER. NO SKINNER NO NELSON. NIELSEN HI CAREER. CARRIER ZERO NO. CORTESE CORTESE KNOW DOLLY ALI HI THE RAZA. REISER NO AIKMAN. HEY MAN NO GROWTH. GROVE I COME LONGER. COME ON OVER NO LEHRER. MMHM MMHM LAYERED AND. NO MCGUIRE. MCGUIRE NO MELINDA'S HI LINDA I MEANT MAN NO NEWMAN. NUMBER NOT VOTING FOR TO ABOUT. TROUBLED HI PAM FAN NO STERN. MY COFFEE MY COFFEE MILK. FIVE FIVE NOTES ELEVEN. FOR THE LOTUS EYES FIVE NOTES ELEVEN AND SO WE WILL CONTINUE OUR WITH THOSE MOMENTS ARE NOT APPROVED WE WILL CONTINUE OUR DISCUSSION OF THE ITEMS IN THE LIST. SKEWS ME THAT I HAVE SENATOR CALM WATER FOLLOWED BY SENATOR DRAWS OR SENATOR RICK CASKEY SENATOR MEN AND SENATOR PAM. BUT IF I MISSED YOU JUST WAVE AT ME AND I WILL ADD YOU TO LET'S GO AHEAD SENATOR CALM WATER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THIS QUESTION IS- I BELIEVE I HOPE FOR A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OR LA- AND IT IS IN REGARDS TO- THE WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND RESILIENCY- FUNDING FOR OUR CONSERVANCY LANDS I YOU KNOW I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT I AND- YOU KNOW SORELY DISAPPOINTED IN. THE ALLOCATIONS- ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO SOUTH LA I AM NOT TRYING TO POSIT THAT THIS IS AN EITHER OR THAT ONE COMMUNITY OVER ANOTHER SHOULD BE PRIORITIZED BUT I AM ADVOCATING FOR MORE- ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO SOUTH LA. IN THE LAST TWO SURPLUSES- THE BALDWIN HILLS AREA WAS LEFT OUT COMPLETELY. WHILE OTHER COMMUNITIES WITH OPEN FIELDS WERE GIVEN RESOURCES- SOUTH LA THE BALDWIN HILLS CONSERVANCY- IS A FOUR HUNDRED PLUS- SOME ACREAGE FROM. PARK WITH OTHER LANDS IT IS AN URBAN POPULATED AREA- CLOSE TO HOMES BUT ALSO INCREDIBLY PROXIMATE TO A VERY ACTIVE OIL FIELD- AND YET BALDWIN HILLS HAS EITHER CONSISTENTLY RECEIVED THE LOWEST OF ALL CONSERVANCY'S OR WE'VE BEEN LEFT OUT COMPLETELY- AND LOOKING THROUGH THIS I WAS SURPRISED THAT- CANINE BLOOD BANK GOT MORE FUNDING THAN THE BALDWIN HILLS CONSERVANCY. THEN A CONSERVANCY FOR SOUTH LA. SO I'M JUST CURIOUS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ARE WHAT'S THE REASONING BEHIND LEAVING OUT. A CONSERVANCY THAT SERVICES ALL OF SOUTH LOS ANGELES AND HOW ARE THESE DETERMINATIONS MADE- WITH REGARDS TO WHICH CONSERVANCY'S GOT ALLOCATIONS AND HOW MUCH THEY GOT. THE HIGH TENSION MASTER JAGGER PART OF FINANCE I THINK I WOULD KNOW THAT YOU'RE GENERALLY WE TRY TO LOOK AT THE THAT KIND OF HIGHLY HIGHER FIRE RISK AREAS AS ONE OF THE CRITERIA BY. WHAT THEY HAD TO REALLY POINT IS ALL THE CAL FIRE MR GRANTS THOSE ALL COMMUNITY THAT SO JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT A SPECIFIC ANSWER IF HE CALLED OUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE GENERAL AREAS NOT GETTING FUNDING. THE GRANTS ADMINISTERED BY STATES ARE ACTUALLY GOING OUT TO THESE COMMUNITIES THAT APPLIED TO THE FUNDING- WHICH- YOU KNOW WE'RE DOING AS BEST WE CAN TO TRY TO EXPEDITE- THROUGH DIFFERENT PROCESS SEE THAT SO I JUST GENERALLY YOU KNOW. FOCUSING ON HIGH RISK AREAS BUT AGAIN THERE'S OTHER FUNDING IN THIS PACKAGE THAT THAT ALL OF THE REGIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THAT HAVE- VIRUS GOODBYE. SERVICE CENTER FROM ORDER TO HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS NO I JUST WANT TO GET CLARITY SO THERE ARE SOME CONSERVANCIES THAT ACTUALLY HAVE A DIRECT APPLICATION AND THEN YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S ANOTHER POT OF MONEY THAT PEOPLE JUST HAVE TO FIGHT FOR. YEAH AND SO THAT'S FOR SOUTH LA TO FIGHT FOR. TWO PACKS. THE WHOLE THE WHOLE PART OF FINDING AND YET TYPICALLY REPLICATION PROCESS FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO APPLY BUT ONE OF THE STRATEGY THAT WE ARE PLANNING HEREAS WELL IS WORKING TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR THE LOCALS TO DEVELOP PLANS AND DEVELOP PROJECTS THAT THEY COULD GO THROUGH THE PIPELINE- I'LL BE THAT CAL FIRE MR GRANT AND THE CONSERVATIVES AND SO- IT IS- YOU KNOW AN APPLICATION PROCESS FOR. THOSE OTHER POTS OF FUNDING. THANK YOU I MEAN I'M NOT LESS DISAPPOINTED BUT AT LEAST YOU ANSWERED THE QUESTION. SENATOR DRAWS- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I WANT TO COMMENT ON A B. ONE FIFTY FIVE AND A B. ONE SIXTY TWO. IS THAT. CERTAIN OKAY THANK YOU- AND BOTH OF THEM HAVE TO DO WITH- ECONOMIC. IMPACTS OF. OF OUR RESOURCES AND PROGRAMS ON A. B. ONE FIFTY FIVE. FROM. YOU KNOW AS AS WE HAVE THE NEED FOR PROJECTS THAT RESPOND TO OUR OUR CLIMATE NEEDS AS THOSE- AS THAT INCREASES. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT SO DO THE NUMBER OF WORKERS NEEDED TO TAKE ON- THOSE PROJECTS- WHEN WE ADDRESS ENVIRONMENTAL. ISSUES AND ECONOMIC ECONOMIC IMPACT REQUIRED THAT THE STATE HAS TO ALIGN THE CLIMATE AND THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT GOALS WE NEED TO INVEST IN THE PEOPLE AND THE PROGRAMS. TO ALLEVIATE THOSE IMPACTS BUT ALSO IN A MORE POSITIVE WAY BENEFIT FROM THIS ECONOMY THIS GREEN ECONOMY THAT WE'RE INVESTING IN- SO WHY DO WE NEED. CONSERVATION WORK FORCE DEVELOPMENT IN A VERY EXPLICIT WAY NOT THAT MAYBE IT'LL HAPPEN WHO KNOWS WHICH ORGANIZATIONS. BUT RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE AN EFFECTIVE WORKFORCE PIPELINE TO TRAIN YOUNG ADULTS. FOR STATE OR LOCAL PARKS DEPARTMENTS- AND OTHER CAREERS IN THE NATURAL RESOURCES FIELD- AND I THINK THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO ACHIEVE THE STATES OUR CLIMATE GOALS WHICH WERE ALL IN SUPPORT OF- THAT MEANS THAT WE NEED TO HAVE AN EXPANDED AND A SKILLED WORKFORCE. READY ARM AND THAT MEANS WE HAVE TO HAVE THE EDUCATION THE TRAINING THE CERTIFICATIONS THAT WE NEED. TO BUILD THESE CLIMATE CAREERS. AND THESE CONSERVATION WORK FORCE PROGRAMS ARE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ALIGN OUR ECONOMIC GOALS AND OUR CLIMATE GOALS THE WORKING POOR THE USE OF- COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT OF A LOT OF OTHER CAREERS. WHAT DO THEY SEE IN THEIR FUTURE HOW ARE THEY GOING TO GET PREPARED FOR THAT FUTURE OR IS THAT SOMETHING THAT JUST TOTALLY OUT OF OUT OF REACH FOR THEM SO. I JUST WANT TO COMMENT IT'S NOT A SPECIFIC- BUT- IT'S NOT A SPECIFIC ASK RIGHT NOW BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT KIND OF INFORMATION- ALWAYS GETS LEFT OUT AND- I DON'T THINK THAT WERE- WE'RE REALLY ADDRESSING A NEW GREEN ECONOMY AND- ALL THE NEEDS THAT WE HAVE FOR CLIMATE MITIGATION IF. WE'RE NOT ADDRESSING- THE MEN AND WOMEN WE'RE GOING TO HELP US REACH THOSE CLIMATE GOALS- ON AB ONE SIXTY TWO. I'M VERY EXCITED. THAT THIS INCLUDES HIGHROAD LANGUAGE AND HIGH ROAD LANGUAGES SOMETHING THAT- YOU KNOW OF ADDRESSES OF METRICS ON EQUITY. ON JOB QUALITY ON SUSTAINABILITY WAGE INCREASES ALL THE JOB CREATION. ALL OF THAT NEEDS TO BE INCLUDED AND I'M I'M GLAD WE'RE GOING TO GET A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE BOB THIS. BUT IT SEEMS TO ME WE NEED TO SEE THIS AND ALL THE SPENDING ON THE GROUND PROGRAMS IF WE'RE REALLY GOING TO BUILD A WORKER CENTERED ON SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY ALL FOR EVERYONE. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO AND WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF SPENDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE ELECTRIFICATION AND ALSO ON INFRASTRUCTURE- ODD DOLLARS- ARE WE PAYING ATTENTION TO THE JOBS ARE BEING CREATED ARE WE REALLY CREATING THOSE JOBS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WELL WE ALONE WITH THE MONEY THAT WE'RE GOING TO INVEST- WE COULD CREATE AND SUSTAIN OVER EIGHTEEN THOUSAND JOBS JUST ON THE ISSUE OF TRANSPORTATION SO. I JUST- YOU KNOW IT INVEST IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE WE HAD A REPORT THAT SAID- CLOSE TO THE LEGISLATURE PUTTING CALIFORNIA ON THE HIGH ROAD A JOBS AND CLIMATE ACTION PLAN FOR TWENTY THIRTY IT EMPHASIZED THAT INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE ALONE WILL NOT CREATE A HIGH QUALITY JOBS WE HAVE TO HAVE BOTH THE SUPPLY AND THE DEMAND SIDE- TO CREATE HIGH ROAD FAMILY SUSPECT SUSTAINING JOBS FOR OUR FUTURE- SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE THOSE COMMENTS. I HOPE THAT THE YOU KNOW AS WE GET READY I'M SURE OF SOON TO START TALKING ABOUT NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET THAT WE ARE MUCH MORE EXPLICIT ON THESE TWO ISSUES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR DRAWS OUR SENATOR WHITE COW SKI. THE CITY. LET'S START WITH THE AD PACKAGE- FROM THE SENATE PROPOSAL INCLUDED TWENTY MILLION FOR INVASIVE SPECIES COUNCIL AND TWENTY MILLION FOR UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RESEARCH REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS IMPACTS ON AGRICULTURE. FINANCES COME BACK WITH FIVE MILLION ON EACH IS IT NOT IMPORTANT AT THE UNIVERSITY. STATE REDUCING GREENHOUSE GASES OR THAT INVASIVE SPECIES WITH CLIMATE CHANGE IS NOT A PROBLEM FOR- DEPARTMENT FINANCE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTIONS ARE REALLY COSTLY AND AS NOTED- EARLIER THIS- WHAT THE NEGOTIATION AND THERE WERE A LOT OF THINGS THAT WERE- IND THAT MANY DIFFERENT THINGS IN THE ACT PACKAGE- AND THAT. LEAVE THIS- A TEN MILLION DOLLAR FUNDING OVER MULTIPLE OVER TWO YEARS IN IN IN PARTICULAR BUT I WILL TRY TO SCRATCH YOU KNOW FOR MORE DETAILS TO SIR JACK ARE PERHAPS I COULD REFRESH YOUR MEMORY IN IN MAY WHEN THE GOVERNOR SENT US THE MAY REVISE. HE HAD ONE POINT SIX NINE FOUR BILLION FOR CLIMATE RESILIENCY. THE SENATE TOOK AN ACTION TO RAISE THAT TO THREE. OF THREE BILLION SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE FIVE AND NOW IT'S BECOME THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE SO WELL THERE'S A LOT OF CREDIT BEING TAKEN AROUND TOWN FOR REACHING THE RESILIENCY PACKAGE I THINK IT WAS THIS BODY TO TOOK THE ACTION THIS COMMITTEE. THAT THAT ACTUALLY RAISE THAT SO MY QUESTION WAS YOU SET OUT YOUR PRIORITIES WE SET OUT OUR PRIORITIES AND AT LEAST ON INVASIVE SPECIES N. N. REDUCING CHANGE GREENHOUSE GAS RESEARCH ON AGRICULTURE AND FOOD PRODUCTION. THEY- THEY DON'T. THEY HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE MARK I GUESS THE NEXT QUESTION ON THE OF AGRICULTURE'S WE HAD NINETY MILLION FOR THE DEPARTMENT CONSERVATION. OF FOR THE FARMLAND PROTECTION PROGRAM WHICH WE BELIEVE IN THE SENATE. THAT PROTECTING FARMLAND IS IMPORTANT THAT BEEN. CAN YOU. IT TO THE COMMITTEE WILL NOT MILLION WAS REMOVE BY FIVE. AGAIN HAS NOT REGISTERED YOUR REGULAR CUSTOMER DETAILS. IF THEIR GENERAL PART OF FINANCE I MEAN JUST TO REITERATE NEWS LEAVE A COMMENT THOSE ARE JUST PART OF A COMPROMISE OF BALANCING THAT MEETS YOUR PRIORITIES OF- BOTH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION AND SO AS PART OF THAT- THIS- PACKAGE THAT BEFORE YOU IS THE COMP RIGHT BACK. C. SURGERY I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THAT BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY SAID THE GOVERNOR WANTED ONE POINT SIX NINE BILLION I MAY AND THE SENATE ONE OF THREE POINT SIX SO WE'VE- ADDED WE'RE IN WE ARE NOW AT THREE POINT SIX SEVEN FIVE BUT AS I GO THROUGH THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REQUEST. TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR CLIMATE ADAPTATION GRANTS HE GOT IT TWENTY FOR REGIONAL CLIMATE. CREPITUS COLLABORATIVE'S HE GOT IT- WHERE'S THE OTHER THING. I KNOW TO MANY FIRE. EXCUSE ME. MY CONCERN IS THAT THE SENATE PRIORITIES THAT WERE LAID OUT IN MAY. DIDN'T RECEIVE ANYTHING. SO THAT'S THE ACT PACKAGE WHICH I THINK THE GOVERNOR GOT EVERYTHING THAT HE WANTED BUT LET'S LET'S LET'S MOVE TO THE CLIMATE RESILIENCY PACKAGE BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE GREATEST CONCERN THE SENATE LAID OUT A PRIORITY FOR AS WE'VE HEARD MY- COLLEAGUE MS COM LOCKER TALK ABOUT STATE CONSERVANCY PROGRAMS IN THIS MISTER DOLLIES FAILED- AMENDMENT IS OTHER RESILIENCY PROGRAMS OUTSIDE THE DEPARTMENT OF RESOURCES WE ALLOCATED SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR CLIMATE RESILIENCY PROGRAM SO THIS IS NOT ONLY FIRE PROGRAMS BUT WATER PROGRAMS HIGH ALPINE PROGRAMS IN. WE GOT SIXTY MILLION. THIS YEAR PLUS MAYBE A PROMISE THAT MAYBE YOU'LL GIVE US SOME MORE NEXT YEAR- AND I'M WONDERING. THAT HE'S BEEN IN THE PUBLIC REALM SINCE MAY MAY JUNE JULY AUGUST SEPTEMBER YET. YOU HAVE CHOSEN TO COME UP WITH. THREE TWO HUNDRED MILLION FOR ITS COMMUNITY RESILIENCY CENTERS AND THREE HUNDRED MILLION FOR EXTREME HEAT- SECTORS WHERE DID THAT COME FROM WORD TO WORD THAT WAS NOT PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE WAS NOT PART OF ME- WORKED AT THE SENATE DID WITH THOSE NUMBERS COME INSTEAD OF THE CONSERVANCY PURPOSES WHICH WE HAVE. HEARD FROM SYDNEY MANY SENATORS ARE BEING OVER SUBSCRIBED IN. WANTING HAVING SHOVEL READY PROJECTS. YES I SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TO THE CONCERN OF THE FUNDING SO THERE'S SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE CLAMP PACKAGING TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO I WILL KNOW THAT IN THE OUT YEARS THERE'S ACTUALLY ALSO FINDING THAT COUNTRIES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR AND THERE'S ACTUALLY A MINIMUM OF SIXTY MILLION PER YEAR AND THOSE BARRIERS. THAT WE INCLUDED IN THE TRAILER BILL AS PART OF SATISFIED AND THAT TO A MINIMUM AMOUNT AND SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU LOOK AT THE- THAT MOSTLY BENEFIT NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS IT IS ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AT TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. AND A TRAILER BILL EXPLICITLY FIVE CONSERVANCY- ELIGIBLE AND ACTUALLY PROVIDE THE MINIMUM LEVEL THE CONSERVATIVES FILLER PROSELYTIZING FOR AROUND WHERE YOU KNOW THAT THEY COULD- APPLY WITH SPECIFICALLY THAT POT OF FUNDING IS WHERE YOU KNOW. IN THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS THE ADMINISTRATION WILL WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE EXACTLY PROGRAM THOSE DOLLARS ACCORDING TO HOW THE KIND OF TRAILER WILL OUTLINE THE TYPICAL THE ELIGIBLE USES WHICH AGAIN INCLUDES CONSERVANCY. ON OTHER CONCERT AT THE JUST THAT CLARIFY. ON THE EXTREME HEAT SO PART OF WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION LOOK BAD IS LOOKING AT HOW TO ADDRESS OUR VARIOUS CLIMATE RISKS AND EXTREME BEING EXTREME HEAT BEING- THE EMERGING AND IMMEDIATE CLIMATE RISK THE MINISTRATIONS ACTUALLY WORKING ON AN EXTREME HEAT FRAMEWORK THAT'S GOING TO BE RELEASED LATER THIS YEAR SO AS PART OF THAT THAT THERE BE DIFFERENT STRATEGY THAN. PROGRAMS THAT WOULD BE DEVELOPED WHAT WE WOULD HAVE HAD TO COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE- WITH- OUR PROPOSAL FOR THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS TO THEN BE PART OF THAT DISCUSSION DURING THE BUDGET PROCESS YEAH BECAUSE IT YOU KNOW WE HAVEN'T HAD HEARINGS ON THAT AND IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE TREATING THE CONSEQUENCE YOU KNOW WE KNOW WHEN WE HAVE WHEN THE CLIMATE WILL CHANGE THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE. IS ANTICIPATE THE CAUSATION THE SAY OKAY THERE'S TOO MUCH FUEL IN THE FOREST WE NEED TO REMOVE IT NOT WHEN. THE FORCES BURNING UP WHAT WE HAD TO ADD AFTER WE DO HAVE SOME MY- FOR TREE PLANTING. LET'S GET TO THE SEVEN HUNDRED C. EIGHT THAT IS THE MALL BAND- FLOOD IT SEEMS LIKE WE CONFLATED A BUNCH OF- SEGMENTS AND IN THERE AND I'VE BEEN TRYING TO WORK THROUGH THE LEGEND OF THE BILL BUT I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY GOTTEN TO HELL THAT'S BREAK. BROKEN OUT BUT DAD. I DON'T YOU'RE SAYING THAT THAT'S WHAT MONEY FOR CONSERVANCY'S OR SOME OF THE WORK THAT MAY HAVE BEEN DONE FOR CLIMATE RESILIENCY PROJECTS. YOU'RE GOING TO WORK OUT. SO THERE'S TRAIL ROLE LANGUAGE- AND- ONE FIFTY FIVE EXACTLY DETAILS- THIS POT OF FUNDING AND THAT THE ALLIES WILL USE THAT AND SO- ENERGETICALLY DETAILS CONSERVANCY HAT HAVE A MINIMUM AMOUNT THAT GOES THROUGH PEOPLE GET. IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AT TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR SO IT JUST LOOK AT THE CONTEXT ON ON THAT KIND OF THE CONCEPT OF THE SATISFIED- WEEKNIGHT IF THERE'S YOU KNOW MUTUAL SHARED PRIORITIES- WITH A DIFFERENT NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS A THIRTY BY THIRTY GOALS. THE RESTORATION IS ACTUALLY GONNA BE COMING OUT WITH A COUPLE DIFFERENT STRATEGIES OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS- RELATED TO THIRTY BY THIRTY- WHICH- THE EXECUTIVE ORDER LAST YEAR ADDED A LOT TO A BILL PASSED. THAT CAMPAIGN IF I'D BE A VISUAL COMPOSER WITH A STRATEGY ON HOW TO ADDRESS A THIRTY BY THIRTY GOALS AND THEN THERE'S ALSO GOING TO BE AN UPDATED NATIONAL WORKING LAND CLIMATE SMART STRATEGY. AS TO WHAT WE WANT IF WE WANT TO BE ARE YOUR FUNDING TO BE INFORMED BY THOSE STRATEGIES WHERE WE HAVE TO HAVE TO COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE TO PRESENT. HERE'S A STRATEGY THAT HERE'S THE PROPOSED PROGRAM THAT WE WANT TO ADDRESS THE VARIOUS TYPES OF GOALS AND EFFORTS BUT AGAIN THAT WOULD GO THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS THOSE FUTURE YEARS. WELL WE ACCESS THE CIVICALLY INCLUDED CONSERVANCIES WITHIN THE TRAINER BILL LANGUAGE IT'LL BE KNOWLEDGE THAT THAT IS A TOP PRIORITY OF THE SENATE AND AS LONG AS- AND MANY OTHER NUMBERS. YEAH I DON'T I DON'T THINK I'M EXPRESSING MYSELF IN THE RIGHT FORM IT WAS OUR IDEA TO HAVE THE CLIMATE RESILIENCY B. AT THREE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLAR PACKAGE NOT THE ADMINISTRATION'S YOU WANT ONE POINT SIX WERE THREE POINT SIX. SO IT'S GREAT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO COME BACK TO US. AND MAYBE INCLUDE SOME OF OUR CONSERVANCY PROJECTS THAT THE GROUP REPUBLICAN SIDE IN EVERY MEMBER HERE HAS BEEN SAYING WE'RE READY TO BUILD WE WANT TO REMOVE SOME. FUEL WE WANNA FIX UP OUR RIVERS WHO WANTED- REPAIR OUR WHAT. I GUESS. LET'S SEE. D. YOU HAVE REGIONAL CLIMATE RESPONSE PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. WHERE DID THAT COME FROM BECAUSE THAT'S NOT IN THE MAY BUDGET IT'S NOT IN ANYTHING THAT WE DID IN THE SENATE. SEPT TWO IN THIS BUDGET. YOU'VE GOT YEAH I MEAN YOU'VE GOT THE YOU'VE GOT THE ENTIRE AMOUNT THAT THE GOVERNOR WANTED FOR- T. CC'S TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE COMMUNITIES HOLE FOR FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY BUT THIS IS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY ON TOP OF THAT. AND AGAIN. IT'S A CAUSATION OR IS IT THE CONSEQUENCES. KERLIKOWSKE DISS- ERIC LEAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF. ON THIS DATE DOES THAT SO IT'S A THREE WAY NEGOTIATION IT WAS A DEAL BETWEEN THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE AND THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE PLAN FOR YOU IS THE PREDEFINED L. E. YOU. AGAIN YOU FUNDED EVERYTHING THAT THE GOVERNOR WANTED THE FOOT THE TCC. URBAN GREENING CENTERS EVERYTHING IS YOUR NUMBER AND THEN YOU ADD THIS NEW STUFF IN. HI I MEAN YOU SAY IT'S A THREE WAY DEAL. IT'S NOT THIS IS NOT THE SUBJECT WASN'T EVEN ON ON% OUR PROPOSAL I MEAN I GET A THREE WAY DEAL WHERE YOU SAY YOU WANT FIVE HUNDRED WE GOING THREE HUNDRED YOU GET FOUR HUNDRED. THAT I DON'T SEE ANY OF THAT WE HAVE. COASTAL PROTECTION FOR PROJECTS IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY ZERO WETLAND RESTORATION FOR THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY ZERO COASTAL PROTECTION FOR PROJECTS IN SANTA. ANA RIVER CONSERVANCY FORTY MILLION ZERO KELP RESTORATION FOR FISHERIES ZERO. BUT THE STATE PARKS GOT THEIR TWELVE MILLION FOR SEA LEVEL RISE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE GOVERNOR WANTED. SENATOR MURKOWSKI OF GOD A NUMBER OF OTHER MEMBERS ON MY LIST. WELL I THERE'S FRUSTRATION THOSE BEEN EXPRESSED- FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE FROM OTHER MEMBERS ABOUT THE INTEGRITY OF THE CLIMATE RESILIENCE WE'RE- WE'RE- TRYING TO EXPRESS THE DESIRE TO ACTUALLY HAVE. PROJECTS THAT REDUCE THE CAUSES OF CLIMATE NOT TO REACT TO HOW WE'RE GOING TO REBUILD OUR CITIES AFTER THE AFTER THEY'VE BEEN REMOVED AND IT'S JUST- ANAHEIM. SMALL I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT MISS MADAM CHAIR IT'S- IT'S THOSE. ZACKS EXASPERATING TO BE ABLE AT THE LABOR DAY WEEKEND AND TRYING TO GO THROUGH- THREE THOUSAND PAGES HERE FOR THE PUBLIC TO SEE TO BE THERE THEIR GUARD AGAIN SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING WHAT ARE YOU DOING FOR OUR CLIMATE. AND WHAT YOU DO FOR WILDFIRES AND IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE YOU KNOW ITS- IT'S AN INSPIRATIONAL IT'S NOT BOLD IT'S NOT OTHER RHETORIC THAT WE'VE HEARD I APOLOGIZE FOR CARRYING ON- HELLO- NOT TO MINIMIZE YOU HAVE EXPRESSED HER FRUSTRATION HOWEVER WHAT I WANT TO REMIND MEMBERS. IS THAT. WE ON THIS PACKAGE WHICH YOU MOST OF YOUR MEN BRING ENOUGH RESOURCES. EXCEPT FOR THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND IN ALMOST EVERY CASE WE ARE USING GENERAL FUND DOLLARS WE HAVE NEVER BEEN IN A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE WE HAD GENERAL FUND DOLLARS TO BE ABLE TO ALLOCATE IN THIS WAY. SO OF COURSE AT THE POINT WHERE WE DO FORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF HIGHER REVENUES THAN ALL OF US FEEL VERY STRNGLY ABOUT HOW TO ALLOCATE THEM AND WE'RE NOT ALWAYS GOING TO GET THE MALACHY DID THE WAY. THAT WE AND I DON'T MEAN TO INDICATE THAT THIS IS JUST ONE INDIVIDUAL BUT- IT'S- THE YOU KNOW THESE THINGS ARE NEGOTIATED AND- IT IS QUITE SIGNIFICANT AS YOU POINTED OUT CENTER WACO SKI THAT WE HAVE THREE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS HERE FOR CLIMATE RESILIENCY. AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE HAVE ANOTHER BITE AT THE APPLE TO NEGOTIATE SOME OTHER DETAILS IN IT. AND THAT AS WE KNOW GIVEN THAT IT IS ALREADY- MIDDLE AUGUST THAT- EVEN IF WE HAD APPROPRIATED IN VARIOUS OF THE PACKAGES MORE FOR SAY THIS FISCAL YEAR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HARD. TO EXPENDITURES DUE TO THE FACT THAT WE ARE THAT WE WEREN'T EXPECTING WE DON'T HAVE EVERYTHING IN PLACE TO SPEND LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY SO I THINK THIS IS A- REALLY GOOD TIME FOR US TO BE. BRITAIN ROLLING UP OUR SLEEVES AND GETTING INTO MORE DETAIL SO THAT WE CAN. REALLY VISIT AND ALSO OBVIOUSLY IN OUR APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE FOLLOWING YEAR. BUT I AM VERY VERY IMPRESSED AND I THINK WE SHOULD ALL BE THAT WE ARE DIRECTING THIS LEVEL OF INVESTMENT TOWARDS WILDFIRE TOWARDS DROUGHT. TOWARDS CLIMATE RESILIENCY SO AGAIN I HAVE THERE'S A NUMBER OF FRUSTRATIONS IN. I GOT A SERVICE MANAGER PLEASE I DO WHAT I WANT FOR US BUT I THINK WE ALSO DO I DON'T WANT TO AND IT IS A FUNNY ANALOGY TO MAKE EITHER ONE OF THEM IS THE FORESIGHT WHICH I DO HAVE. WE MADE A BUDGET DEAL THAT SAID WE WERE GOING TO SPEND FOUR HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS THIS BUDGET YEAR ON CLIMATE RESILIENCE AND THAT WAS AGAINST THE SENATE RECOMMENDATION THAT WE TAKE THE THREE POINT SIX CENTS PER ITEM OFF OVER THREE YEARS. THE MEASURE IN FRONT OF US IS ONLY SPENDING THREE POINT. THREE HUNDRED SIXTY NINE. MILL SO WHERE DID THE OTHER SEVENTY ONE MILLION GO THAT DAY WE ALREADY GOT CHOPPED DOWN BUT NOW WE GOT CHOPPED DOWN ANOTHER SEVENTY ONE MILLION WERE. THE FIRE PREVENTION OR ALL THESE OTHER PROGRAMS CLIMATE YOU KNOW SAN FRANCISCO BAY RESTORATION WHILE REVENUES WILLING WE'LL BE ABLE TO REVISIT. AND APOLOGIES BUT I WOULD LIKE TO CALL ON THE OTHER SENATORS WHO I HAVE ON THE LIST- HE HAD OTHER NAMES I HAVE HERE ARE SENATOR MENTIONED OR PAN SENATOR NELSON SENATOR DOLLY. AM I MISSING SOMEONE SENATOR MCGUIRE. APOLOGIES WHO DID I MISS. OKAY SENATOR MAN GO AHEAD- S. CAN BE A TOUGH ACT TO FOLLOW I JUST HAD ONE VERY NARROW QUESTION- IS SO GOING TO THE EDUCATION INDEPENDENT STUDY ISSUE- I WASN'T QUITE CLEAR ON SORT OF- HOW SOME OF THE DIFFERENT MOVING PARTS- INTERACTED AND SO- I UNDERSTAND THAT- THE ELEAZAR MAY OBTAIN SIGNED INDEPENDENT STUDY MASTERS AGREEMENTS AFTER.% THIRTY DAYS BYE THEY WILL GET APPORTIONMENT. AND THE ADA FUNDING ISSUE KIND OF GETS TAKEN OFF THE TABLE THIS IS AN ISSUE IS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION I LOVE MY LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS- AND I GUESS THAT COME WITH THE MAIN THING THAT THE STREET ONE OF THE THINGS THAT STRUCK ME I THINK THIS. CASE CAROLINA THEIR CONCERNS AROUND. THE USE OF INDEPENDENT STUDY TO DEAL WITH COVERT NINETEEN QUARANTINES BUT- ONE THING THAT THEY AND NUMBER OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS POINTED OUT TO ME IS THAT. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET THE STUDENTS TO ACTUALLY COMPLETE THEIR INDEPENDENT STUDY PACKETS WHEN THERE ARE IN QUARANTINE. AND THEY WERE CONCERNED THAT THE- WHEN THESE WERE NOT COMPLETED THAT THEY MIGHT BE PENALIZED AND I WASN'T QUITE CLEAR- FROM THAT. FROM THE GET A- MATERIALS THAT WE RECEIVED WHETHER AT LEAST WE'LL GET FUNDING WENT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER STUDENTS TO COMPLETE THOSE AND IT HAS THE FACTS. DEPARTMENT FINANCE. I DON'T KNOW MAN I'LL TAKE MY QUESTION TO JUST. THANK YOU TESCO HOMES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THE WAY THAT INDEPENDENT STUDY AN EIGHTY EIGHTY FOR PURPOSES OF APPORTIONMENT IS EARNED- PURSUANT TO EXISTING LAW THAT EXISTED PRIOR TO COPE. IS THAT STUDENTS COMPLETE OUR WORK PRODUCT ASSIGNED TO THEM BY THEIR TEACHER- AND THIS COULD CONSIST OF MANY DIFFERENT THINGS BUT ESSENTIALLY THERE HAS TO BE SOME SORT OF TANGIBLE WORK PODUCT THAT COMES FROM IT- AND THE TEACHER ASSIGNED A TIME VALUE TO THAT WORK PRODUCT- THAT IS THEN USED WHEN- AUDITORS LOOK AT. THE I. S. PROGRAM IF IT'S A PROGRAM- IS AN AUDITED- FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING HOW MUCH A PERSON AN EIGHTY PERSON IN THIS EARNED. SO THAT'S KIND OF A LONG ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION THE SHORT ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS- TO THE EXTENT THAT L. E. A. IS CHOOSING TO USE PACKETS AS THE METHOD FOR- EXCITING TIME VALUE TO ASSIGNMENTS YES THOSE WOULD NEED TO BE COMPLETED IN ORDER FOR. THEIR PORTION TO BE EARNED THAT'S HOW THE TIME IS- CALCULATED THE TIME VALUE OF AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE IS CALCULATED FOR PURPOSES OF RUNNING A PORTION INDEPENDENT STUDY HOWEVER I WOULD NOTE THAT THAT IS THE MORE TRADITIONAL INDEPENDENT STUDY. THERE'S ALSO. COURSE BASED INDEPENDENT STUDY. HI IS IT TO MODEL- IS OF COURSE. MODEL SO- A SCHOOL WOULD AND PUT TOGETHER OF COURSE- AND GET IT APPROVED AS THE COURSE BASED I. S. BETTER OFF COURSE WITH INDEPENDENT STUDY THAT THEY'RE OFFERING. AND STUDENTS WOULD JUST GET- THEY WOULD EARN A PORTION OR THEY'RE ONLY EIGHT BASED ON THEIR THE PERCENTAGE OF COMPLETION OF THE COURSE AND THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN. THE WORK PRODUCT AND THAT THAT IS THE EQUIVALENT INDEPENDENT STUDY. HOPEFULLY HOPEFULLY. I ANSWER THAT QUESTION FOR YOU. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT- I'M SENATOR PANTS. THANK YOU A MAN BUT IF BUDGET CHAIR- TO VIC. COMMENT AND THEN A QUESTION- SO FIRST OF ALL I'D THE COMMENT IS- IS- THE- CITY CENTER REPRESENTING THE SIXTH DISTRICT ACTUALLY- MY DISTRICT IS ONE OF THE MAJOR HUBS FOR- ACTUALLY AFGHAN REFUGEES IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY AND- SO I DID WANT TO EXPRESS MY- GRATITUDE AND APPRECIATION TO THE GOVERNOR AND- ADMINISTRATION. TO INCLUDE THE SIXTEEN POINT SEVEN MILLION AND GENERAL FUND TO HELP SUPPORT. AFGHAN CITIZENS DIRECTLY FROM AFGHANISTAN AND SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THEM THE SUPPORT AND HERE IN CALIFORNIA AS THEY- COME TO OUR STATE. MY QUESTION ACTUALLY IS PERTAINS TO THE FUNDING TO- FOR PUBLIC HEALTH SO I APPRECIATE IN EIGHTY ONE SEVENTY- THERE'S AN ALLOCATION OF APPROXIMATELY HALF A BILLION DOLLARS- TO THE PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH- FROM THE CDC FOR THROUGH THIS GRANT AS WELL AS- YOU KNOW THERE'S NO FUNDS FOR. THE RE OPENING SCHOOLS AND THEN FINALLY- NINETEEN POINT THREE MILLION. THE DPH PURSUANT TO FEDERAL HEALTH DISPARITIES GRANT AWARD- SO. APPRECIATE THIS FEDERAL FUNDING GOING TO THE- THE PART OF PUBLIC. HEALTH BUT I GUESS. I HAD SOME. ABOUT MORE SPECIFICS AND I GUESS THE- WELL IT DOWN TO. FIRST OF ALL- IS ANY OF THAT POOR AND ANY PORTION OF THAT MONEY PARTICULARLY- THE HALF A BILLION- FROM CDC AND THE NINETEEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLAR DAYS. ALL GOING TO THE STATE THE PROBABLY COULTER SOME OF THAT'S BEING THEN. RE GRANTED BY THE C. PH TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. AND SECOND OF ALL I APPRECIATE THAT WE ARE STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COVETED PANDEMIC AND WELL WE NOW HAVE VACCINES FREELY AVAILABLE TO MANY. CALIFORNIANS THERE ARE STILL- YOU KNOW. ACTUALLY THE CASE NUMBER. OF HOSPITALIZATIONS IN THE COUNTRY IS. ABOVE WHAT WAS LAST YEAR EVEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S THE CASE SO THEY'RE NOT AS BAD AS MANY OTHER STATES- WHAT. PORTION IN TERMS OF THIS FUNNY ASIDE FROM DIRECT SERVICES FOUR COVE IT. WHAT PORTION OF THIS MONEY WILL BE USED TO ACTUALLY ENHANCE OUR UBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH INCLUDES. IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS SO WE HAVE BAITED BETTER DATA TRANSFER- STAFFING AND LABORATORY CAPACITY BECAUSE AGAIN BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOING AWAY ANYTIME SOON UNFORTUNATELY AS MUCH AS WE WERE HOPING. THAT BY THIS FALL WE DOUBT BE OUT OF THE WOODS WE'RE CLEARLY NOT THERE AND- I DON'T ANTICIPATE THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN- BEFORE THE END OF THIS COMING BUDGET YEAR EITHER SO HE'S CAN. CAN YOU PLEASE TELL ME IN MORE SPECIFIC DETAILS IN TERMS OF. THESE FUNDS PROPORTIONS GONNA GO ON TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND WHAT PORTION IS GOING TO BE INVESTED BEYOND DIRECT SERVICES. INTO PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. CENTER CAN ALSO I PLACE YOU OVER TO ONE MY COLLEAGUE IN OUR HEALTH UNIT. HI THIS IS- ADAM DORSEY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO- IT'S- SLIGHTLY COMPLICATED BECAUSE THERE'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT GRANTS AND EACH OF THEM HAVE SORT OF A HISTORICALLY DIFFERENT- ALLOCATION BUT- FOR THE MOST PART THE FEDERAL GRANTS FROM THE CDC MOSTLY GO TO. LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS- THE MOST RECENT- CDC GRANT- THE ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS I BELIEVE WAS WHAT IS ALLOCATED TO LOCAL- HEALTH JURISDICTIONS. AND I THINK THAT'S PRETTY TYPICAL IN TERMS OF A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL- MOST OF THESE GRANTS DO TYPICALLY GET ALLOCATED TO LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS AND THAT'S THE WAY THAT WE- CONTINUE TO ROLL OUT MOST OF THOSE GRANTS- EIGHT WITH RESPECT TO- INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE AT THEIR- CERTAINLY THAT IS SOMETHING THAT. THE ADMINISTRATION AND IN CONCERT WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND- LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS EVALUATING- WE HAD AGREED TO A BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL AND THAT JULY BUDGET. FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO DO AN EVALUATION AND A LOOK AT WHERE THOSE NEEDS ARE. AND THE- THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IT WAS INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET BEGINNING NEXT YEAR- THE ANALYSIS IS BEING DONE AS PART OF THAT- BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL WILL- INFORMANT THE ALLOCATIONS- FOR THE THREE HUNDRED NO I APPRECIATE THAT BUT OF THE MONEY THAT'S BEEN ALLOCATED IN THIS BUDGET FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT. NONE OF THAT IS GOING TO GO TOWARD THAT PURPOSE. IT DEPENDS BECAUSE WE DON'T NECESSARILY CONTROL HOW LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS ALLOCATE THEIR RESOURCES SO THERE'S CERTAINLY- COULD SPEND THE SITE YOU KNOW. PART OF THAT SIZEABLE YOU KNOW OUTLAY OF FEDERAL FUNDS FOR- INFRASTRUCTURE POTENTIALLY BUT OKAY AND I THINK THAT ALL OF THIS FUNDS IS GOING ON TO THE LOCALS AND NONE OF ITS BEING RETAINED BY THE STATE. JUST REALLY WHICH IS THE PATHS PASS THROUGH. THE MAJORITY IS GOING TO LOCAL CULTURE CONTINUES VINDICATE THE ROUGH PERCENTAGE ARE WE TALKING 80% 60% NINETY FIVE PERCENT. HISTORICALLY IT'S SOMETHING LIKE SEVENTY THIRTY BUT I WOULDN'T WANT TO COMMIT TO THAT NO NO NO I MEAN A PROCLAMATION OKAY I I'M NOT GONNA HOLD YOU LIKE- WELL THIRTY THIRTY ONE SOMETHING SO. YEAH WELL SOMETHING LIKE THE LC GRAND IT'S BEEN SEVEN OKAY SO THERE IS A STATE ACTUALLY OF THE HALF A BILLION ACTUALLY. ROUGHLY 30% YOU KNOW COULD BE TWENTY FIVE TO BE THIRTY. FIVE OR SOMETHING SOMEWHERE AROUND THAT IS. SO I THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL IS THAT AGAIN APPRECIATE- THE FEDERAL FUNDING THE ALLOCATION AND THAT I HOPE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WILL BE REPORTING BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE AND TO THE ALLEY- ON EXACTLY HOW THESE FUNDS ARE SPENT AND- PARTICULARLY AGAIN. APPRECIATE WE NEED TO USE MANY OF THE- MUCH OF THIS FOR DIRECT SERVICES GIVEN THE ACTIVE NATURE OF COVE IT. BUT ALSO- WHAT WE'RE DOING FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE PART WHICH BY THE WAY ALSO RESPONSIBILITY TO AFTER ALL YOU KNOW THAT. COULD YOU NEED TO FAX DATA. RESULTS IS A VERY INEFFICIENT USE OF STAFF IN TIME SO. I HOPE THAT I CAN GET A COMMITMENT FROM FROM FINANCE THAT YOU'LL BE. REPORTING BACK TO THE LA- INTO LEGISLATURE AS TO EXACTLY HOW THESE FUNDS WERE. DISPENSING HOW IT HOW THEY WERE SPENT. YEAH WE'VE BEEN WORK ON A QUARTERLY. BY WHICH WE UPDATE ON THE- YOU KNOW UNANTICIPATED FEDERAL FUNDS AFTER THE DEPART OF PUBLIC HEALTH GIVEN DISPENSATION INCREASE AND SO WE DO- WHEN WE PROVIDE THOSE UPDATES WE- TRY TO PROVIDE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS WE HAVE AVAILABLE ON ON. HOW ON THEIR INTENDED USE. OKAY WELL- DID YOU GET TO HAVE MORE- YOU SAID INTENDED USE I MEAN I UNDERSTAND THE FEDS HAVE PARTICULAR REQUIREMENTS BUT IT'D BE GOOD IF YOU CAN OUTLINE WHAT THOSE ARE SO I APPRECIATE THAT THESE ITEMS ARE HERE THAT ARE KIND OF LARGE BUCKETS- BUT I'M HOPING THAT- WE CAN FOLLOW UP AND GET MORE SPECIFICS AS TO HOW THESE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE ALLOCATED AND HOW THEY CAN HELP STRENGTHEN OUR PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE. THANK YOU. THE THANK YOU AND CENTER PANEL. LET'S GO TO SENATOR NIELSEN. MADAM PRESIDENT LAYS DOWN THE CENTER I HAVE A FEW MORE MAYBE BUDGET RELATED QUESTIONS BUT I THINK- FOREGO THOSE JUST TO PROFFER A- CLOSING OBSERVATION. THERE ARE THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT. EXECUTIVE BRANCHES ONE IN THE LEGISLATIVE AS ONE AND THE JUDICIAL. IT SEEMS LIKE INCREASING THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH SEEMSTO BE A MIND- THAT THERE YET. THEY MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS. THE GOVERNOR SUBMITS A BUDGET TO THE LEGISLATURE WE DO THOUSANDS OF HOURS THEN OUR SUBCOMMITTEES AND MY THEY WORK HARD. TRYING TO GIVE OUR A PREMATURE. THE BUDGET. AND THEN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST WELL WE'RE GOING TO DO IT THIS WAY GOVERNOR WATCHED IT THAT WAY. AND THE HECK WITH THE LEGISLATURE. THE LEGISLATURE OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS DECADES ACTUALLY. HAVE REGULARLY SEATED MORE OF OUR AUTHORITY LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY OR RATHER MORE IMPORTANTLY THE PEOPLE'S AUTHORITY WE REPRESENT TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH LET THEM DECIDE LET THEM DO IT. DON'T CHALLENGE THE GOVERNOR MY GOSH. WE'VE JUST HEARD MANY EXAMPLES IS VERY NICE. THE MEMBERS HERE WHO WORKED VERY HARD. TO GET CERTAIN THINGS. THAT WOULD BE LEGISLATIVE INPUT INTO THIS BUDGET. YOU HAVE TO BE FINDING OUT THE WELL THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WANTS TO DO THIS. AND THIS IS THE GOVERNOR'S PRIORITY. I'M SORRY GOVERNOR YOU ARE NOT THE DICTATOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YOU ARE NOT THE SOLE ARBITER OF WHAT GOES IN THE BUDGET WE APPRECIATE YOU WE- ENJOY WORKING WITH YOU. WELL I'M ACTUALLY NOT ENJOYING IT SO MUCH ANYMORE. SO I DO HOPE THAT. AND I DO SEE THAT THE MORE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE NOW ASSERTING LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY THE AUTHORITY OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. IF WE DON'T HAVE ANY GREATER EXAMPLE. IT WOULD BE D. D. D. HOW THEY HAVE A GRIEVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS. OVER YEARS. AND THAT AGENCY IS ABSOLUTELY AND CAPABLE. RESPOND AND FRANKLY WITH THE LEGISLATORS HAVE NOT DONE ENOUGH JOB OF REORGANIZING SHAKING UP THAT DEPARTMENT TOP TO BOTTOM. A CLOSE IN OBSERVING THERE IS A LEGISLATIVE BRANCH WE- REPRESENT ABOUT A MILLION PEOPLE. AND I THINK THAT THEY HERE AND WE MUST NOT CONTINUE TO DEFER TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. I HAVE- I'VE NOTICED MY EXCEPT FOR SENATOR DOLLY FOLLOWED BY SENATOR MCGUIRE IS THERE ANYONE I MISSED. OKAY SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR REAL QUICK QUESTION ON EDUCATION FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- HAD A CALL WITH ALL MY SUPERINTENDENTS BUT WE ALSO WANT TO JUST CONFIRM THAT- IS DISTANCE LEARNING ACCOUNTED FOR ADA. IN THIS BUDGET AND THEN ALSO INDEPENDENT STUDY. YEAH THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO JESSICA HOLMES OF MORE DETAILS ON INDEPENDENT STUDY. THANK YOU JESSICA HOLMES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO- IT IT'LL DEPENDS A LITTLE BIT ON YOUR DEFINITION OF DISTANCE LEARNING BUT IF YOU'RE REFERRING TO ZOOM ZOOM IN ON LINE INSTRUCTION- THE ERROR YOU HAVE WHATEVER DEVICE. OR PLATFORM IS USED- THEN YES THAT CAN BE PART OF AN INDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAM- THE ONLY OPTION- THE ONLY THE ONLY CABBIE OUGHT TO THAT IS IF YOU'RE NOT USING IN THE CONTEXT OF COURSE BASED INDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAM AT THE DOES NEED TO BE. A WORK PRODUCT AND PHYSICAL WORK PRODUCT FROM STUDENTS IN ORDER TO COUNT- TOWARDS THE TIME NEEDED TO EARN AN AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE BUT- NOT ONLY IS ONLINE INSTRUCTION AND SEE CHRIS INSTRUCTION ALLOWED. INDEPENDENT STUDIES ACTUALLY REQUIRED- IN THE LAW- DEPENDING ON THE AGE GROUP OF THE STUDENTS BEING TAUGHT- K. THROUGH THREE STUDENTS ARE REQUIRED TO BE PROVIDED- DAILY SYNCHRONOUS INSTRUCTION- VISION ABOUT THE GREATEST INCREASE- IT DECREASES- IN HIGH SCHOOL. IT'S ONCE WEEKLY- OPTION FOR AND- AND SECRETS INSTRUCTION. LET'S JUST IN REFLECTION OF THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT AND STUDY- SO THE SHORT ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS YES AS LONG AS IT IS- ACCOMPANIED BY A WORK PRODUCT. THAT MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS OF INDEPENDENT STUDY. AND THAT AND THAT'S I JUST WANT TO BE REAL CLEAR BECAUSE THIS WAS VERY. FAST VERY POINTEDLY BECAUSE- FOR IF YOU HAVE A- OUTBREAK OF COVE IT IN THE LAST YEAR THEY HAD THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO. DO INDEPENDENT STUDY. AND MANAGE THEIR CASES I SHOULD SAY. AND A LOT OF STUDENTS PREFERRED TO DO INDEPENDENT STUDY SO. I KNOW PREVIOUS. TO I BELIEVE THIS TRAILER BILL. WE WEREN'T WEREN'T ABLE TO DO THAT SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE BECAUSE MY- SUPERINTENDENTS WANT TO HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY. SO THEY CAN MANAGE. THEIR COVERED OUTBREAKS AND STILL GET THE ADA THEY'RE HAVING A HECK OF  TIME- MEETING THEIR BUDGETS WITH THE AMOUNT OF- STILL STOOD- TEACHERS THAT- AT THE FILLING TEACHERS AND CAN'T THINK OF A NAME RIGHT NOW BUT- ANYWAY GETTING GETTING NO SUBSTITUTE AND SO THAT'S IT WAS IT WAS THE NUMBER ONE QUESTION FROM THROUGHOUT MY NINE COUNTIES FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS IF THEY HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THEY GET THE ADA. THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY A POINT OKAY. NO PROBLEM SENATOR MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH READING CHAIR UP. PERSON FOR MOST- YEAH YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS FRUSTRATION AND SO MANY FOLKS ARE TIRED BASED OFF OF THE FIRE IS THAT SO MANY COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN FACING. I THINK CALIFORNIA IS TRULY THE CANARY IN THE COAL MINE. WHEN IT COMES TO THE ISSUES OF WILDFIRES HERE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IT'S NOT JUST THE CLIMATE CRISIS BUT THIS CLIMATE CRISIS IS ADDING TO THE CRISIS AT THE STATE FACES. EACH AND EVERY SUMMER AND FALL. I THINK THAT PROTEIN MACHEN'S CHAIR SKINNER RIGHT CASKEY PURCHASE UP TO CHEER AND THE GOVERNOR HELP LEAD THIS STATE WITH RECORD FUNDING EARLIER THIS YEAR RECORD FUNDING FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION ADDITIONAL FOURTEEN HUNDRED SEASONAL FIREFIGHTERS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN WILDFIRE PREVENTION FUNDING. NEVER BEFORE HAS THE GOLDEN STATE INVESTED AS MUCH ON WILDFIRE PREVENTION RESPONSE AND WE HAVE THIS YEAR. BUT IS ALSO INCREDIBLY CLEAR. COMING FROM A REGION OF THE STATE THAT HAS THE FIRST MILLION ACRE FIRE. WHERE A COUNTY LIKE LAKE HAS TWO THIRDS OF HIS LAND MASS BURN SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THAT WE ARE IN DESPERATE NEED FOR A LONG TERM STRATEGIC PLAN ASSOCIATED WITH WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE. AND I KNOW THAT I SOUND LIKE A BROKEN RECORD EACH AND EVERY BUDGET CYCLE. BUT CAL FIRE ACTUALLY. PEAKED WITH STAFFING BACK IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE. NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE NOW I WILL SAY NO OTHER GOVERNOR HAS INVESTED MORE ON CAL FIRE AND WHAT FIRE PREVENTION THE ONE THAT WE HAVE HERE TODAY THE GOVERNOR'S. AND. OUR RESOURCES ARE STRETCHED THE MEN AND WOMEN ON THE FRONT LINES OF THESE WILDLAND FIRES ARE EXHAUSTED AND WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT A LONG TERM PLAN WHEN IT COMES OF FULL TIME EQUIVALENT FIREFIGHTER POSITIONS WERE STILL TWO HUNDRED SIXTY ONE FIREFIGHTER SHORT FULL TIME OF THAT PLANE BEANS HAVE FAILED. AND WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO RELY ON SEASONAL FIREFIGHTERS ARE WORKING TEN MONTHS OUT OF THE YEAR. NOT RECEIVING THE SAME PAY WHICH CAN REALLY ADD CHALLENGES WITH. IN THE SAME WORKFORCE PROTECTIONS. SO WHAT I WOULD HOPE IS THAT. THROUGH THE LEADERSHIP OF CHAIRMAN CASKEY WHO'S BEEN ON THIS ISSUE THE LEADERSHIP AFTER SKINNER. WHO I'M GRATEFUL FOR HER DIGGING INTO THIS ALONG WITH THE PRO TEAM THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DEVELOP A LONGER TERM PLAN TO BE ABLE TO INVEST IN WILDFIRE PREVENTION LONGER TERM. WHICH THE SENATE HAS LED WITH THE BOND- AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO BRING THE CAL FIRE RANGE TO WHERE IT SHOULD BE- TO MEET THE MODERN NEEDS AT THE GOLDEN STATE BUT I JUST WANTED TO SAY MADAM CHAIR. WELL I KNOW WE'RE IN THE THICK OF IT FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS OF SESSION BUT TENSIONS ARE HIGH BUT WE ALSO CAN'T FORGET HOW FAR WE'VE ALSO COME THIS YEAR. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE INVESTMENT AMOUNT FOR PREVENTION RESPONSE. AND IT'S CLEARLY NOT ENOUGH AND MORE WORK TO DO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR MCGUIRE LET ME SEE. ANY OTHER MIKES UP OKAY- I- WE WILL HEAR FROM THE PUBLIC AND AT THE RISK OF THE WRATH OF SOME OF YOU I THE LOOK WITH THIS IS THE LAST WEEK OF SESSION AND IT DOES GET TESTY. AND THERE ARE NO ACTION THAT WE TAKE WHETHER ITS BUDGETARY OR LEGISLATIVE SATISFIES EVERYONE NOR DID IT EVEN THOSE OF US WHO. WERE MOST INTIMATELY INVOLVED IN THE NEGOTIATIONS WE'RE IT'S GIVE OR TAKE THERE'S A HUNDRED AND TWENTY LEGISLATORS AND THERE'S AN ADMINISTRATION BUT I WOULD SAY. THAT IF WE TAKE THIS PACKAGE FOR EXAMPLE OR THE SET OF BILLS BEFORE. US AS SENATOR WHITE HOUSE KEY POINTED OUT. B. ADMIN. ONLY HAD PROPOSED. A BILLION FOR CRIME REGION. WHAT WE WILL VOTING ON TODAY THIS POINT FIVE BILLION. NOW IT IS AND SPEND IT ALL FIRST YEAR BUT WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SPEND THAT AMOUNT IN THE FIRST YEAR. SO I THINK THAT WE- IT'S OKAY TO BE FRUSTRATED AND EXPRESSES FRUSTRATIONS BUT I ALSO DO NOT WANT US TO LOSE SIGHT OF THE INCREDIBLE THINGS THAT WE ARE DOING. WITH THIS WITH THE BUDGET WE'VE ALREADY ADOPTED THE APPROPRIATIONS YOU MADE AND NOW WITH THIS TRAILER BILLS TO GET THAT MONEY. ON TO THE STREET AND ITO THE PROGRAMS TO. CUT TO CHALLENGE THE CLIMATE CRISIS WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN ALL YEAR ROUND FIRES NOW. AND THIS ACTION IS THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US WOULD GET THAT MONEY TO ST PERHAPS NOT AS FAST AS EVERYONE WANTED BUT IT IS APPROVED IT IS APPROPRIATING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT YES WE WILL NEED MORE WORK FORCE AND- HOPEFULLY WILL HELP PROTECT REVENUES IN THIS UPCOMING YEAR TO DO THAT. AND WE WERE ARE BEGINNING TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT NOW THAT WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS WERE FEELING IT DAILY THE WE'VE GOT TO ADAPT. WE'VE UP TO RECENTLY FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON TRYING TO REDUCE THE EMISSIONS THAT CAUSE IT BUT WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF IT. SO THE RESILIENCY PACKAGE IS AN ADAPTATION PACKAGE AND WE HAVE NEVER PUT FUNDS TOWARDS THAT AND THEN NO ONE MADE THIS COMMENT TONIGHT BUT THERE'S ANOTHER REALLY GREAT THING. IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACTIONS BEFORE US WE ARE GOING TO BE AUTHORIZING. FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. FOR STUDENT HOUSING. WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS EVERYONE HERE KNOWLEDGE IS **** AND WE HAVE STUDENTS NOW THAT LIVE IN VEHICLES THAT COUCH SURF. BETTER HOMELESS ESPECIALLY WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. AND WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN. TO ADDRESS THAT BY PARTNERING WITH OUR HIGHER ED INSTITUTIONS TO BUILD STUDENT HOUSING WHICH WE HAVEN'T DONE IN A LONG TIME SO THERE IS A LOT OF GREAT THINGS. IN THESE ACTIONS AND THE OVERALL WILDFIRE PACKAGE JUST FOR THIS YEAR ALONE IS ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IN SPENDING SO. LET US TURN TO THE PUBLIC NOW THEY MAY HAVE. SOME OTHER FRUSTRATIONS OR PERHAPS THEY HAVE SOME THINGS THEY'D LIKE TO CELEBRATE. SO THERE IS NO ONE IN OUR HEARING ROOM OR I WOULD CALL ON THEM. AND THERE'S NO ONE IN OUR AUXILIARY ROOM SO THAT MEANS WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM PEOPLE CALLING IN. THE PHONE NUMBER FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WANT TO CALL IN IS. EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN THREE THREE SIX pACCESS CODE IS. EIGHT TWO SIX EIGHT FOUR TWO EIGHT- SO- OR OPERATOR DO WE HAVE SOME PEOPLE NOW ON THE PHONE LINES AND COULD YOU TELL ME HOW MANY ARE QUEUED UP.
