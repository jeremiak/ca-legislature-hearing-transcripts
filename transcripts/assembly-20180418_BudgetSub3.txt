GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME TO THE APRIL EIGHTEENTH MEETING OF BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE. BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER THREE. I'M SORRY THAT WE'RE STARTING A LITTLE BIT LATE BUT. WE'RE GONNA I TAKE THINGS A LITTLE BIT OUT OF ORDER BECAUSE. ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY. SLEPT A LITTLE LATE THIS MORNING PARA. AND TO A MS ROSS YOU'RE GOOD ENOUGH TO RUSH OVER. AT MY REQUEST THAT WE CAN SKIP FORWARD AND BEGIN WITH DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. OKAY OKAY FLOORS HOURS THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF I'M JUST GONNA FUNDS WILL BE JUST A FOR THE RECORD. PRETTY OBVIOUS THAT WE DON'T HAVE A HAVE A QUARREL A COMMITTEE HERE YET SO WILL ATTACK ROLE SINCE WE HAVE A. A CORE PRESENT CAN THAT WILL. THE TICKET TESTIMONY IN THE METER OKAY ALRIGHT SO I'M JUST GOING TO JUMP RIGHT INTO THAT ITEMS AS THEY'RE. LISTED FOR TIME FOR DISCUSSION. I'M I'M GOING TO START WITH OUR BE SAFE PROGRAM. THIS IS AN. A A VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAM FOR CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE AS WE KNOW. WITH ALL OF OUR SPECIALTY CROPS WERE VERY DEPENDENT ON HONEY BEES AND POLLINATORS AND THIS IS A PROGRAM. THAT'S REQUESTING ONE. ONE MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS GENERAL FUND. AND TWO POSITIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. FOR US TO MANAGE A P. SAFE PROGRAM AT DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR SEVERAL OBJECTIVES ARM ONE IS TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND SURVIVAL OF HONEYBEES BY INCREASING FORAGING OPPORTUNITIES. REDUCING PESTICIDE EXPOSURE AND PROVIDING FUNDS TO LOCAL ENFORCEMENT THIS WOULD BE THROUGH OUR COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONER OFFICES. TO DO THE WORK OF ENFORCING THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS ON THIS WILL ALSO MAKE AN INVESTMENT OF TECHNICAL RESOURCES FOR DATABASE DEVELOPMENT AND DATA ENTRY TOOLS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR AG COMMISSIONERS TO WORK ACROSS COUNTY LINES TO COORDINATE THIS PROGRAM. CURRENTLY THE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT HAVE THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO CHARGE A FEE FOR BEEKEEPING AND HONEY BEES WHICH DO PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC BENEFIT TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THAT'S FOR A VERY OBVIOUS REASON. THE BEGINNING OF EVERY YEAR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS HOST TO THE WORLD'S LARGEST POLLINATOR PROJECT. WHEN WE ACTUALLY HAVE OVER A MILLION ALMOST TWO MILLION HONEY BEE HIVES IN THE STATE DOING THE THINGS THAT HONEY BEES DO. HALF OF THOSE OVER SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND BUT A LOT OF SONGS WRITTEN ABOUT YEAH I IT'S JUST GREAT FODDER SO TO SPEAK FOR ALL KINDS OF POETRY AND AND SONG WRITING. BIT OVER HALF OF THOSE HONEY BEES ARE COMING FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY INTO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AT SOME. THE IT INDUSTRY A PICKUP BEEKEEPERS MANY MANY SMALL VERY INDEPENDENT OPERATORS FROM ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. ARM AND WE DON'T HAVE THE THE REACH TO THOSE OUT OF STATE PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO ENFORCE ITS KINDA REGISTRATION PROGRAM. BUT WE'RE HOPEFUL WITH THIS PROGRAM AND PIPE REALLY KEEPING A FOCUS WITH A COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONERS OFFICES THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ENFORCE THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENT WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL BE BENEFICIAL TO THE BEE KEEPERS THEMSELVES. FIRST OF ALL OVER RECENT YEARS EVERY TIME I GO OUT AND SPEAK WITH PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE WE HAVE AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF THEFT OF HONEY BEE HIVES. AND THEY'RE VERY VALUABLE BULLET ALSO FOUND THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST PLACING HIVES. SPORADICALLY WITHOUT ANY COORDINATION WITH THE LOCAL AT COMMISSIONER OFFICE OR WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE THE LAND OWNERS. THERE IN AREAS THAT ARE CONFLICTING WITH PEST MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS ON NEIGHBORING GROUNDS SO THE REGISTRATION PROGRAM IS VERY KEY FOR US ON THAT'S. WE ALSO WANT TO USE THIS PROGRAM AS A WAY TO MAP OUT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES TO REALLY ENHANCE FORAGING OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THE HONEY BEES HAVE GOOD NUTRITION WHILE THEY ARE IN OUR STATE. AS WELL AS WE THINK THIS WILL HELP US ALSO IMPROVE FORAGING OPPORTUNITIES FOR NATIVE POLLINATOR HABITAT. AS WELL. SO THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE P. SAFE PROGRAM TO MEDICAL THROUGH ALL OF THE SORT YOU WANT ME TO STOP AFTER EACH ONE. FOR I WOULD LIKE YOU TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THEM BUT TO TAKE A BREATH BECAUSE I DO HAVE A QUESTION THAT. AND. THAT IS THERE'S A. A. COMMENT. A STAFF COMMENT THAT. TALKS ABOUT TO. THE. OF FUNDA I THINK THAT WOULD ANNOYED WHEN THE WRONG TERM ON THE WRONG PAGE. GIVE ME ONE MOMENT. THERE'S A COMMENT ABOUT. STAT ARE A GIVING CONSIDERATION TO THE COST TO OPERATE THIS PROGRAM THAT. APPROACH TO BE IT SHOULD BE SHARED WITH BEEKEEPERS AND I'M WONDERING IF YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS. ON THE MAJOR THOUGHT AS BECAUSE WE HAVE OVER HALF OF THE POPULATION OF BEES COMING FROM BEE KEEPERS OUT OF STATE THAT'S THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE PRESS AND WE DON'T HAVE THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO ASSESS. THE AT THIS MOMENT. OKAY. ARE THERE OTHER QUESTIONS. ELIOT ONE ASIDE AND THANK YOU SO MUCH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND. WE'RE RECOMMENDING THE APPROVE WHEN YOUR FUNDING TO ESTABLISH THE BE SAFE PROGRAM THAT WE THINK IT IS PROGRAM WOULD HELP COUNTY AGRICULTURE AND RURAL COMMISSIONERS. ADDRESS A NUMBER OF THREATS TO THE STATE'S BE POPULATION INCLUDING DIOP'S FROM CONTRACT WITH PESTICIDES. THAT ARE TOXIC TO BE IS IN THE IDENTIFICATION. OF PASSED IN DISEASES THAT CAN AFFECT BEES. I'M HOWEVER WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER ITS OPTIONS REGARDING HOW TO TELL A FUND TO BE SAY PROGRAM GOING FORWARD. AND THOUGH IT'S APPROPRIATE DEFINE THAT THE PROGRAM WITH GENERAL FUND DUE TO THE WIDE BENEFIT THAT BEES PROVIDE. AYE WE ALSO THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FUND THE PROGRAM USING FEE REVENUES FROM REGULATED BEE KEEPERS WHO WOULD BE THE MAIN BENEFICIARIES OF THE PROGRAM. AND SO THEREFORE WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE DROP TAPE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO REQUIRE CDF AGED TO PROVIDE REPORT. TO THE LEGISLATURE AS SPECIFICALLY WILL REQUIRE PUTTING ON ANNUAL REVENUES COLLECTED UNDER THE CURRENT. APIARY REGISTRATION FREE CANDY COST ADMINISTER THE APIARY REGISTRATION FREE AND OPTIONS TO ALIGN FEE REVENUES WITH COUNTY COSTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES. AND FUND THIS PROGRAM THROUGH THROUGH FEES AND SO UNDER THIS. PROPOSAL YOU WOULD HAVE THAT FUNDING FOR ONE YEAR AND THEN YOU'D HAVE MORE INFORMATION NEXT YEAR IN THE LEGISLATURE WOULD HAD OF INFORMATION TO DECIDE. WHETHER THIS PROGRAM SHOULD BE FUNDED ENTIRELY THROUGH GENERAL FUND ENTIRELY THROUGH FEES ARE A MIX. THANK YOU. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FUTURE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE THINK THAT THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES A BROAD PUBLIC BENEFIT SO WE THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO. FUND A PROGRAM WITH ONGOING GENERAL FUND OF IT IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING LIMITED TERM FUNDING MAY POSE CHALLENGES FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF AND TRYING TO FILL THE POSITIONS. IT IN A. SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT. ONE YEAR FUNDING WOULD HAVE THAT TO. IT IS NOT AN INTERN FUNDING I THINK AS WITH AL ALL OF THE PROPOSALS. MAY MAKE IT HARD FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO FILL THE POSITIONS BUT I THINK THE MAIN. POINT IS THAT. THIS PROPOSAL PROVIDES A BROAD PUBLIC BENEFIT AND WE THINK THAT IT'S APPROPRIATE TO USE GENERAL FUND TO FUND ON AN ONGOING BASIS. AND WHAT ABOUT THE A REPORTING LANGUAGE ANY ISSUES WITHOUT. I THINK THAT. AND MANY IF. IF TO THE EXTENT THAT IT. RESULTS AND WORKLOAD THAT MIGHT NOT BE OBSERVABLE WE WOULD HAVE CONCERNS. I THINK. THAT. IF A IF THE DEPARTMENT HAS THE. ABILITY TO. DO THAT WITHIN EXISTING RESOURCES WELL WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE CONCERNS BUT. BUT AGAIN WE WOULD. WE SUPPORT THE A PROPOSED% PROPOSAL US REQUESTED WITH ON GOING TO AND FROM OKAY THANK YOU. WE HAVE A RECOMMENDATION HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN THAT'S WITH A CABLE DO TODAY. ISSUE THREE. SHORT SO THE NEXT ONE. IS AS DEALING WITH OUR PLIGHT BORDER PROTECTION STATION. UMP THE PROPOSAL REQUEST NINE MILLION THREE HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS GENERAL FUND FOR THE ACQUISITION OF ABOUT TWENTY FIVE ACRES OF LAND. WEST OF A VERY AGING AND ANTIQUATED. BORDER PROTECTION STATION ON IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY THIS IS ON INTERSTATE TEN. INTERSTATE TEN IS THE MAIN FREEWAY THAT CONNECTS THE PORTS OF LOS ANGELES AND THE PORTS OF LONG BEACH WITH ARIZONA NEW MEXICO TEXAS LOUISIANA MISSISSIPPI ALABAMA AND FLORIDA. SO THIS IS A MAJOR TRADE QUARTER AS WELL AS HEAVY TOURISM TRAFFIC. SO WHEN THIS WHEN THIS BORDER STATION WAS BUILT IN NINETEEN SIXTY ONE WE WERE PASSING THROUGH ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND VEHICLES A YEAR. AND IN THE MORE RECENT YEARS WE ARE OVER FIVE MILLION VEHICLES A YEAR SO IT REPRESENTS PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUES AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT DELAYS FOR TRAVELERS AND TRUCKERS WHO ARE GOING THROUGH THIS FACILITY. ONCE THIS LAND IS ACQUIRED ON OUR INTENT IS TO PROPOSED CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW APPROXIMATELY NINE THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT FACILITY WITH OFFICE SPACE. AIR CONDITIONING APPROPRIATE LIGHTING. AN EMERGENCY GENERATOR TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ADDRESSING THE PUBLIC SAFETY AS WELL AS OUR EMPLOYEE SAFETY ISSUES AT THE WHITE BORDER PROTECTION STATION. THANK YOU AND THAT'S A GOOD TO ADD DOES THE LA OUR DEPARTMENT FINANCE HAVE COMMENTS ON THIS. TO SECURE TIME FOR US TO PAUSE AND TO FORM A QUORUM WELCOME MISTER KALRA. YOUR PHONE. BLOOM. HERE FONG. KALRA. MULLIN PATTERSON. AND ON THIS ITEM WE HAVE FOR A RECOMMENDATION TO APPROVE THIS BUDGET IS THERE A MOTION TO THAT EFFECT. THEIR SECOND. SIR. THANK YOU. BLOOM. I FONG. KALRA. MULLIN PATTERSON. THANK YOU A ISSUE POOREST. OUR ONGOING BATTLE WITH THE. A CITRUS CECIL ANOTHER PASS. YES SO THIS IS A PROPOSAL THAT REQUEST TWO AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND AUTHORITY AND TWO AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS. AND AGRICULTURAL FUND AUTHORITY AND FISCAL YEAR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FOR OUR ONGOING AND INCREASINGLY COMPLEX BATTLE WITH THE ASIAN CITRUS CELL AND WHICH VECTORS THE TREE KILLING LONG LONG BEING TO SEIZE. UP WE ARE HERE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO NOT FOLLOW IN FLORIDA'S PATHWAY WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT THE CITRUS. GROWTH IN OUR STATE AND ALL OF THE CITRUS TREES IN A RESIDENTIAL AREAS ON IT'S A BIG PROGRAM AND IT CONTINUES TO EVOLVE AND BECOME EVEN MORE COMPLEX. BUT I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT THE INVESTMENT BY THE LEGISLATURE AND IMPORTANTLY THE INVESTMENT BY THE CITRUS INDUSTRY ITSELF. AS WELL AS FEDERAL FUNDS FOR THE RESEARCH PROGRAM. ARE WORKING WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN STANDING UP A PROGRAM. AND KEEPING THE DISEASE OUT OF COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION AREAS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGE FOR US IN THIS PROGRAM EVEN SINCE THE TIME THAT THE ORIGINAL PCP WAS. PUT TOGETHER IS THAT. IN ADDITION TO AN INCREASING POPULATION OF THAT ASIAN CITRUS SALAD WHICH HAS EXPANDED POINTING REGIONS AROUND THE STATE. WE NOW HAVE. ONE LONG BEING IT'S CURRENTLY IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS ONLY AND THE LA BASIN WE WANT TO KEEP IT SEPARATED FROM THE COMMERCIAL CROWS. ON BUT IT IS A VERY LABOR INTENSIVE PROGRAM OF SURVEYING FOR THE DISEASE ITSELF. AND IT HAS INCREASED TREMENDOUSLY THE WORKLOAD FOR LABORATORIES DOING THE DIAGNOSTICS TO RUN THAT DISEASE. IDENTIFICATION PROCESS AND THEN BEING ABLE TO TAKE THE ACTIONS TO PULL THOSE TREES OUT. SO IT HAS INCREASED IT IS AN EVOLVING PROGRAM BUT WE BELIEVE THAT WITH THIS PROPOSAL OF TWO AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS OF GENERAL FUND IN ADDITION TO TWO AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS. FROM THE AD FUND THAT WE WILL HAVE ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO CONTINUE TO. FIGHT THE PROGRAM THAT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL SO FAR WE ARE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE CITRUS. COMMITTEE AND DOING ITS STRATEGIC PLAN THAT HAS FACTORED IN THIS NEW FINDING AT THE DISEASE AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS AND HOW THAT MIGHT NEED SOME ADJUSTMENTS IN OUR PROGRAM GOING FORWARD. ON IT'S AN INTENSIVE PROGRAM IT'S REQUIRING A LOT OF PEOPLE AND ESPECIALLY ITS IN PINK. CREASING THE LOAD ON OUR LABORATORIES TO BE ABLE TO RUN ALL THE DIAGNOSTICS THAT WERE DOING THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THAT. I ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES. JUST IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS CAME OUT WITH A REPORT THAT'S REALLY LOOKING AT THE RESEARCH WHAT ARE THE LONG TERM SOLUTIONS TO THE US WE DON'T YET HAVE THEM. BUT I BELIEVE BASED ON THE EXPERIENCE AND THE SUCCESS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE PIERCE'S DISEASE PROGRAM. IN THE EUROPEAN GRAPE VINE MOTH PROGRAM THAT WE'RE PUTTING RESEARCH DOLLARS AND THE RIGHT KINDS OF THINGS WE NEED MORE EARLY DETECTION TOOLS TO ASSIST THE INDUSTRY OF MAKING THEIR OWN MANAGEMENT DECISIONS. IN ADDITION TO RESEARCH TO IMPROVE THE PARIETALS THAT ARE BEING OFFERED THAT WILL BE RESISTANT TO THE DISEASE ONE LONG BEING ITSELF SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE AWARE THAT WHILE THIS IS AN INCREASINGLY. COMPLEX IN LARGER PROGRAM WE HAVE REALLY MADE THE INVESTMENTS I BELIEVE IN THE RIGHT KINDS OF PLACES TO PROTECT THE COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION OF CITRUS IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU LEGISLATIVE ANALYST HAS SOME COMMENTS ON THE ASSEMBLY AND SHAWMUT WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND WE'RE RECOMMENDING YOU APPROVE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. GIVEN THE RECENT INCREASES IN THE SQUARE MILES UNDER QUARANTINE FOR BETH EIGHT PATIENTS INTEREST SELIGMAN LUNG BANG. THAT THE GROWING NUMBER OF TREES INFECTED WITH ONE ONE THING OF THE PAST FEW YEARS IN THE THREAT IT NATION'S INTERESTS RELATIVE AND LOT ONE MONTH BEING POSED TO THE STATE'S CITRUS INDUSTRY. WITHIN THREE QUEST IT'S IS REASONABLE WOULD ALSO RECOMMENDED THAT THAT MEASURES IT HAS IN PLACE ARE ARE. IN CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTING ARE SUFFICIENT TO SUPPRESS THAT ANNA. A SENSITIVE SELIGMAN LONG RUN BEING WHETHER THEY'RE ADDITIONAL MEASURES THE STATE SHOULD CONSIDER. AND. AND WHAT WOULD BE THE COSTS OF IMPLEMENTING ANY SUCH MEASURES. THANK YOU THIS DEPARTMENT VANESSA COMMITS. ALRIGHT THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM DYESS. I KNOW THAT THIS IS THE ISSUE OF FOR A GREAT INTEREST TO. A TO THE CITRUS INDUSTRY I SHOULD HAVE PAUSED AFTER ISSUE THREE SINCE WE TOOK ACTION ON THAT ITEM TO ASK FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. BUT IF THERE IS A PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUES NUMBER TWO THREE OR FOUR WHEN WE TAKE THAT AT THIS TIME. WHILE YOU'RE STEPPING FORWARD. ALTHOUGH. WE HAVE ONE PERSON OF STEPPING FORWARD. MAYBE NOT SO INTENSE BUT BEFORE BEFORE EACH SPEAK I JUST WEST OF THE RECOMMENDATION ON THIS WAS TO APPROVE IT BUDGETED. BASED ON COMMENTS THAT I'VE ALREADY RECEIVED FROM THE INDUSTRY. WHO HAVE BEEN? PUTTING A LOT OF MONEY INTO THIS ISSUE. I THAT THEY THINK THAT OF THE AMOUNT THAT WE ALLOCATE. A. A SHOULD BE GREATER. AT I WANT TO GIVE SOME TIME TO ALLOW CONSIDERATION OF. OF FOR A POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL BUDGET ALLOCATION ON THIS ON BOTTOM IS SORT AND HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN HAPPIER FOR ME NOW. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WHO ARE KNOWN HE JAKE ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA CITRUS MUTUAL AND THANK YOU FOR THAT COMMENT AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE HOLDING THE ITEM OPEN AND HAVING A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME. TO DISCUSS THIS ISSUE AND YOU KNOW WALKING INTO THIS YEAR THIS YEAR WE KNEW THAT THE. SPREAD OF THE DISEASE IN THE BUD WAYS. GROWING BUT WE WERE LOOKING AT MEASUREMENT. OPERATIONS THAT WE. GLAZER CONTAINING AND WHAT WE'RE DOING UNFORTUNATELY RECENTLY FOUND OUT YOU KNOW AT THIS TIME LAST YEAR WE HAD FIFTY THREE FINES OF LONG LONG BEING. AND WE RECENTLY JUST FOUND OUT THAT NOW WE'RE AT OVER SIX HUNDRED. OF ONE LONG BEING AND SO ON THE PROBLEM HAS JUST EXPANDED DRAMATICALLY AND FOR THAT REASON WE JUST APPRECIATE YOU HOLDING IT OPEN AS YOU SAID THE CITRUS INDUSTRY HAS PUT A LOT OF THEIR OWN FUNDS INTO THIS PROGRAM THEY'VE ALSO HELPED FIND A NEW RESEARCH FACILITY DOWN AT. UC RIVERSIDE SPECIFICALLY TO GO TOWARDS TRYING TO FIND A CURE FOR THIS DISEASE IN WHAT WE CAN DO YOU. AND THEN ALSO JUST LOOKING FOR FUNDS TO HELP CFA BE ABLE TO PUT THEIR. PUT MORE RESOURCES INTO THIS PROGRAM HAVE MORE DEDICATED STAFF TO THIS PROGRAM. SO THAT WE CAN REALLY CONTAIN THE DISEASE AND CONTINUE WORKING ON A CURE AND KEEP IT OUT OF OUR COMMERCIAL GROVES WHICH. IS ABOUT A THREE POINT. THREE BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WE APPRECIATE THAT AND WE APPRECIATE THAT. COMMITTEE FOR ON TAKING SOME MORE TIME TO LOOK INTO THIS ISSUE. BOB PAUL TOWERS WITH BE SMART CALIFORNIA AND PESTICIDE ACTION NETWORK AS WELL AS A CENTER FOR FOOD SAFETY SINCE THEY'RE NOT HERE. WANTING TO I SHARE. ARE A COMMITMENT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE TO KEEPING CALIFORNIA'S BE SAFE. LUCKILY OUR COMMERCIAL HONEYBEES AS WELL AS OUR NATIVE POLLINATORS AS WELL AS PROVIDING FORT OPPORTUNITIES CAN FORGE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE STATE'S BEES. US WILL CHALLENGES WE HAVE WITH THE PROPOSAL AS OUTLINES I'M IS THAT'S THE. KERN PROPOSAL AND THE WAY THAT WE WARN BEEKEEPERS AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO MOVE THEIR BEES IGNORES THE PERSISTENCE OF MANY OF THE PRODUCTS THAT ARE USE. I MEAN HE'S PRODUCTS RESIDE FOR HOURS IF NOT DAYS AFTERWARDS AND CONTINUE TO THREATEN NOT ONLY COMMERCIAL BEES OP BUT ACTUALLY CONTINUE TO THREATEN NATIVE PIECE THAT CAN'T BE E. I RELOCATED. I IN ADDITION WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE LACK OF INVESTMENT AND FORGE OPPORTUNITIES S. LOOKING A FISH AND GAME LAND FISH WILDLIFE PLAN IS NOT ENOUGH. CONTINUED LOOK ON OUR OWN FARMS FOR SOLUTIONS AYE WE SEE IS THE A RIPE AREA FOR INVESTMENT. SO THOSE ARGUMENTS AND ITEM NUMBER TWO IN TERMS OF ITEM NUMBER I TH FOR AND WE ARE. WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THAT WE SHARE THE CONCERNS ABOUT SIX I AGENTS IT RESULTED IN ONE MONTH BEING OUT WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN IN THE STATE'S OUGHT TO KEEP THE PASSED OUT. BUT I THINK THE CHALLENGE WE FACE IN TRYING TO CONTROL CITRUS THOUGH IT AND THE DISEASE IS THAT WE MIGHT USE TOOLS THAT DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD AND ONE OF THOSE TOOLS IS BANNED. AYE CORPORATE FAUCET NEUROTOXIC PESTICIDE I THAT THE STATE IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING AYE THE DEPARTMENT HAS THAT REGULATION. AYE AND SO IT WAS MEANT TO BE SLATED FOR BAND AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND SO WE AS WE SEE CONTINUED USE OF THIS PRODUCT FOR CONTROLLING CITRUS PSYLLID WE'VE CONCERNS ABOUT CONTINUING TO FUND. THIS PROGRAM IN THIS WAY AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A COMMITMENT TO NOT USING THAT HARMFUL PESTICIDE THAT POSES NUNLEY THREATS TO PEACE BUT TO TO AYE. TO PEOPLE AS WELL. SARIA I WAS DISTRACTED WHEN YOU BEGAN SPEAKING COULD YES LE REAP A SHAVE YOUR NAME AND OBSERVERS UPON PAUL TOWERS FOR THE FIRST ITEM I'M WITH THE SMART CALIFORNIA. THIS SITE ACTION NETWORK AYE AND THE CENTER FOR FOOD SAFETY FOR THE SECOND ITEM CALIFORNIANS FOR PESTICIDE REFORM. HOLLY FOR MANY WITH WHITE HOUSE PUBLIC AFFAIRS ON BEHALF A CALIFORNIA STATE BEEKEEPERS ASSOCIATION DAY. IN SUPPORT OF THIS BCP BUT WE WERE I'M ALSO HOPING THAT THE ASSEMBLY WOULD CONSIDER ADDITIONAL FUNDING I'M FOR THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A LONG AWAITED THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT FOR YEARS ON SEVERAL INEFFICIENCIES ESPECIALLY AT THE BORDER STATIONS WITH INSPECTIONS. I'M IN FUNDING HAS BEEN THE NUMBER ONE CONCERN AND REASON WHY WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO. DO MORE TO ENSURE. A SWIFTER AND TRENDS INTO A INTO THE STATE AND INTO ON THE COUNTY SO WE'RE HOPING THAT THERE BE ADDITIONAL FUNDING INCLUDED FOR THAT. AS WELL AS SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THE RULE CRIMES TASK FORCE STILL BE HIVE THEFT IS HAPPENING ALL OVER THE STATE ESPECIALLY DURING THE SEASONS I AM. WITH ALMONDS MINIVAN FOR BEES TO BE IN THE ALMONDS OR HOPING FOR MORE FUNDING FOR THAT AND FOR MANY OF LEGISLATION WE PASSED OVER THE YEARS. ON GRANTING MORE ACCESS TO PUBLIC LANDS STATE AND FEDERAL LANDS WE'VE GOT LEGISLATION ON THE BOOKS THAT HASN'T BEEN IMPLEMENTED EFFECTIVELY AND WE HOPE WITH THIS PROGRAM IN THE STAFFING THE WILL BE ABLE TO ENSURE MORE EFFECTIVE USE OF OUR PUBLIC LANDS AGAIN WE SUPPORT THE BCP BUT HOPE. YOU WOULD CONSIDER ADDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING THAT WE FOR PRESIDENTIAL ONE POINT TWO MILLION HOPEFULLY ON TO MAKE IT A ROOM ROBUST AND COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO AND THE BASIC PROGRAM THANK YOU. DENNIS ALL THE ON THE ON THE HEALTH THE ALLMAN ALLIANCE WE AGREE WITH THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER WE PROVIDED. OF A HOST OF. BCP AUGMENTATIONS TO THE STAFF AND MANY OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WE APPRECIATE YOU REVIEWING THOSE HOLLY WENT THROUGH THOSE VERY WELL. AND AGAIN. POLLINATOR HEALTH AND BE HEALTH IS VERY IMPORTANT THE ALLMAN INDUSTRY AS WELL AS. OF THE ENTIRE. PLANT BASED AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY. ON ITEM NUMBER THREE WHICH OF THE BORDER STATION HERE ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA GRAIN FEED. CALIFORNIA SEEDS SUCH AS WE JUST TALK ABOUT. BUT ISSUES AT THE BE HEALTH WE TALK ABOUT ONE LONG BEING AND YOU'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT ANIMAL HEALTH LATER. ALL THOSE ISSUES ARE CRITICAL OF THE BORDER STATIONS TO PREVENT. INVASIVE PLANTS AND A. A. PASSED TO COMMENT BUT ALSO ANIMAL DISEASES AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT NEEDS TO BE UPDATED ALLOW FOR BETTER THROUGHPUT BUT ALSO ALLOW FOR OPPORTUNITIES. TO BE ABLE TO. DIVERT FOLKS AND AND HOLD THEM OFF WHEN THERE ARE ISSUES SUCH AS A. CONTAMINATED PRODUCTS COMING INTO THE STATE'S HELP A WE ALSO SUPPORT THANK. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS TO SHOULD GUARANTEE WITH AGRICULTURAL COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA ALSO VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT OF CDF A QUEST ON THAT. AT BCP FOR PATENT THE BE SAFE PROGRAM AND ALSO THE AUGMENTATION REQUESTED BY THE PREVIOUS TWO SPEAKERS THANK YOU. GREAT EDU. LET'S MOVE ONTO A ISSUE. WHERE IS YOUR FIVE? FIVE. THEORY IS IT IS A NEW REQUEST OUT DEVELOPMENT A PESTICIDE ALTERNATIVES. ON THIS IS A PROPOSAL THAT REQUEST FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND IN ONE POSITION FOR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. AN ON GOING FOR US OFFICE OF PESTICIDE CONSULTATION AND ANALYSIS TO SUPPORT THE SCIENTIFIC DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF ALTERNATIVE PEST MANAGEMENT TOOLS. UP WITH THAT WITH A FOCUS ON BIO CONTROL EFFORTS. CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE IS VERY BOUNTIFUL IN THE STATE WE HAVE OVER FOUR HUNDRED SPECIALTY CROPS. THAT MEANS I OFTENTIMES THE ONLY PLACE SOME OF THESE CROPS ARE GROWN ARE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO THAT EVEN IF THEY'RE LARGE A CREATURE. IN CALIFORNIA ON A NATIONAL SCALE IT'S VERY HARD SOMETIMES TO ATTRACT. THE ATTENTION AND THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT OF SOME THE MANUFACTURES OF PEST MANAGEMENT TOOLS TO CREATE PRODUCTS FOR SPECIALTY CROPS. BOB THIS IS A PROGRAM DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE PRESSURES THAT ARE ON OUR HISTORIC PEST MANAGEMENT TOOLS IN CALIFORNIA WELL WE ARE THE NUMBER ONE AGRICULTURAL STATE BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS WERE ALSO HOME TO FORTY MILLION RESIDENTS. AND THAT GROWING POPULATION AND LAND USE DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS HAVE PUT A LOT OF UNUSUAL PRESSURES ON THE USE OF OUR. TRADITIONAL PEST MANAGEMENT TOOLS AND WE HAVE PRODUCTS THAT ARE LEGALLY REGISTERED BUT HAVE MEDICATION MEASURES ARE ARE FACING POTENTIAL T. REGISTRATION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO THIS IS. THING MODEST PROPOSAL BY THE ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE AN INVESTMENT AND HOPEFULLY LEVERAGE GRANT FUNDS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AS WELL AS. COORDINATING WITH THE COMMODITY GROUPS. TO ACCELERATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALTERNATIVE PEST MANAGEMENT TOOLS THROUGH A PROGRAM THAT'S ACTUALLY AUTHORIZED TO THE FARM BILL ALSO IT'S TIMELY AND TALKING ABOUT THIS TODAY BECAUSE ARE STARTING THE DISCUSSIONS ON THE FARM BELT. CALLED UP BY OUR FOR PROGRAM. UPDATES ON A REGIONAL BASIS HISTORICALLY CALIFORNIA ON THE WEST COAST DOESN'T GET WHAT WE THINK IS OUR FAIR SHARE OF AYE ARE FOUR DOLLARS AND WE THINK THAT HAVING THE STATE INVESTMENT WILL HELP US LEVERAGE. GETTING MORE INVESTMENT PRODUCTS FOR THE SPECIALTY CROPS IN CALIFORNIA. AND THE WEST COAST SO WITH THIS WE BELIEVE WE CAN MAKE A GOOD START ON HELPING THE INDUSTRY IDENTIFY PRIORITY ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE IN THE PIPELINE AND ACCELERATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEM. AND BRINGING THEM TO COMMERCIAL USE ON OUR FARMS AND RANCHES. THANK YOU HAVE A RECOMMENDATION TO HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN. JUST A LAYOVER HOW* COMMENTS OR DEPARTMENT THAT'S. SEEING NONE. WILL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT ITEM WHICH DOES HAVE A RECOMMENDATION TO APPROVE ITS BUDGET THAT. WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT TO AT THE END OF THIS ITEM ON. BOTH ISSUES FIVE AND SIX. SELECT. RIGHT NOW I KNOW I KNOW I FOR SCIENCE RIGHT YEAH. I'M GONNA WAITING UP I THINK I WOULD HAVE WELCOMED THE GRAPHIC. BOB THIS IS A PROPOSAL FOR OFFICE OF FARM TO FORK TO REQUEST FOR FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND AUTHORITY FOR BOTH FISCAL YEAR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY. TO FUND TWO POINT FOR EXISTING POSITIONS IN OUR OFFICE OF FARM TO FORK. TO ADMINISTER A FEDERAL FOOD INSECURITY NUTRITION INCENTIVE CRAMPED. THAT CDFA RECEIVED A YEAR AGO AND TO CONTINUE OUR WORK IN IMPLEMENTING THE CALIFORNIA NUTRITION INCENTIVE PROGRAM. THE FUNDING WILL SUPPORT ON THE CALIFORNIA NUTRITION INCENTIVE PROGRAM WHICH IS DESIGNED TO PROMOTE FOOD ACCESS WITH A FOCUS ON HELPING. OUR CITIZENS REDUCE DIET RELATED DISEASE BY INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF FRESH PRODUCE THAT IS IN THEIR DIET. I'M SO THAT THIS IS I'M SOMETHING THAT CAN HELP UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES WHERE FOOD ACCESS HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE AS WELL AS PARADES LOCAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY BECAUSE IT SUPPORTS PROGRAMS FARMERS MARKETS. TO SEE ESSAYS AND LOCAL RETAIL STORES ON THESE RESOURCES REALLY HAVE A A A STRONG FOCUS ON PARTNERSHIP WITH NON PROFITS IN THE STATE. TO INCREASE PUBLIC EDUCATION IN THE CONSUMPTION OF CALIFORNIA GROWN PRODUCE. AND TO COORDINATE THOSE EFFORTS ON A STATEWIDE BASIS I APPRECIATE YOUR. THAT'S PROPOSAL. THANK YOU AND IS THERE ANY. LA OVER DEPARTMENT FINANCE COMMENT ON THIS. IS THERE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE FIVE OR SIX. SEEING NONE I THINK WILL I WAIT TO. UNTIL WE HAVE A FULLER. COUNTY HERE AT THE AT AT THE DYESS TO VOTE ON THIS ITEM. WILL DEFER THAT UNTIL LATER IN THE MEETING AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN. IF THIS WILL BE MY MY FINAL ITEM AND ONE THAT SEEMS TO HAVE A LOT OF INTEREST BECAUSE IT IS A. NEW PROGRAM THE FIRST OF ITS KIND IN THE NATION. DEALING WITH THE USE OF ANTI MICROBIAL DRIVES AND LIVESTOCK THIS ACTUALLY WILL BE THE FINAL PHASE OF FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF A LOT THAT PASSED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN SB TWENTY SEVEN. THIS PROPOSAL REQUEST TWO MILLION SIX HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND AUTHORITY. ELEVEN POSITIONS FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND NINETEEN AND ON GOING. FOR BOTH OUR ANIMAL HEALTH AND FOOD SAFETY SERVICES DIVISION AND OUR INSPECTION SERVICES DIVISION WHICH OVERSEES OUR FEET PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM HAS RECEIVED BASE FUNDING AT THE FIRST YEAR. ONE MILLION THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN A POSITIONS AND TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN. AS WELL AS LAST YEAR TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT HAVE POSITIONS THESE ARE HIGHLY SPECIALIZED POSITIONS MANY OF THEM ARE VETERINARIANS. ANIMAL HEALTH SPECIALISTS THIS PROPOSAL AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WILL FULLY IMPLEMENT. SP TWENTY SEVEN. WHICH HAD AN EFFECTIVE DATE OF JANUARY FIRST TWENTY EIGHTEEN. WE ARE USING THE INFORMATION THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF WORK THAT'S BEEN PUT IN THE THE FIRST TWO YEARS AND MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDER. OUTREACH MEETINGS AS WELL AS ONE ON ONE VISITS TO ALL OF THE RETAIL FEED OUTLETS IN THE STATE. ON AND WE'RE USING THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE BEEN COLLECTING AND THAT DATA. FOR THE REGULATIONS THAT THAT WE ARE IN CHARGE OF PRODUCING. WHICH IS A PROGRAM THAT REALLY WILL PUT NEW LIMITS ON THE USE OF ANTIBIOTIC MATERIALS AND LIVESTOCK. PRODUCTION IN THE STATE. PROVIDING. EXTENSIVE STEWARDSHIP GUIDELINES FOR EVERY SPECIES OF FARM ANIMALS IN THE STATE. AND REALLY HAVING A FOCUS OF REDUCING ANTIBIOTIC USE IN THE STATE AND APPROVING THE STEWARDSHIP PRACTICES OF LIVESTOCK AND MEAT PRODUCTION ANIMALS IN THE STATE. I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS HAD BEEN REYES I CAN WAIT FOR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE RATHER THAN JUST PLUNGING AND WITH WHERE I THINK YOU MIGHT WANNA GO. ON THIS TOPIC BUT I WILL SAY WE'VE BEEN DOING EXTENSIVE STAKEHOLDER OUT REACH THIS ALSO REQUIRES A GREAT DEAL COORDINATION FOR US WITH OUR SISTER AGENCIES. THE BOARD OF PHARMACY AS WELL AS THE BOARD OF VETERINARY MEDICINE. AND SO. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF COORDINATION AND THERE WILL BE A LOT MORE AS WE IMPLEMENT THIS PROGRAM TO MAKE IT AS EFFECTIVE AS WE KNOW THAT. IT NEEDS TO BE AND THAT WE WANT IT TO BE AS A MODEL PROGRAM FOR THE FOR THE COUNTRY THANK YOU ALL HAVE AT LEAST ONE QUESTION BUT I THINK IT MIGHT BE USEFUL FOR US TO HEAR FROM THE PUBLIC FIRST AND THEN. I OPENED IT UP TO QUESTIONS FROM THE DICE IF THAT'S ALRIGHT AND. LA HOSTS CHICKEN HAD NO SO THERE'S NO COMMENTS. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I ASSUME THEN. WHY DON'T WE HEAR FROM THE? PUBLIC ON THIS ISSUE. GOOD MORNING. HE. IT MONNING IS THE CHAIR JUST MULLIN ON BEHALF OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL I'M PINCH HITTING THEM FOR THEM TODAY WAS THEIR EXPERTS ON THE EAST COAST. BUT I DO UNDERSTAND THIS ISSUE AND THEY RAISE A CONCERN THEY VERY VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT OF FUNDING THIS PROGRAM THEY WERE VERY INVOLVED IN THE STABBING XIN THIS. THEIR CONCERN IS THE INTERPRETATION BY THE DEPARTMENT AND THE THEY WANT TO ENSURE THAT BEFORE THIS FUNDING IS PROVIDED THAT THERE IS A LEGISLATIVE DIRECTIVE GIVEN TO. THE DEPARTMENT TO DO THREE THINGS. TO ISSUE THIS GUIDANCE IN REGULATION FORM. SO THAT PEOPLE KNOW CLEARLY WHAT THE PROHIBITED USES OUR. TO COLLECT ALL VETERINARY FEED DIRECTIVES FROM FEED MILLS AND THIRDLY TO PUBLISH IT KLAPROTH FOR RELIABLE DATA COLLECTION. WE BELIEVE THEY ON THE RIGHT PATH THEMSELVES BUT THEY REALLY NEED TO TIGHTEN UP SO THE PEOPLE OUGHT CLAIRE WHAT THE STATUTE SAYS. THE STATUTE DOESN'T INTEND TO HAVE AS BROAD THE DESCRIPTIONS WE BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENTS A SINGLE. THANK YOU. I'M BILL ALLEY ó FOR ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP AND ALSO REPRESENTING. CALPERS THE CENTER FOR FOOD SAFETY CONSUMERS UNION CLEAN WATER ACTION AND BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS. NO WE SUBMITTED INFORMATION OF A AYE COMMITTEE AND TO WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH CDFA FOR AWHILE NOW AND FOLLOWING UP ON MR BELONGS COMMENTS WE AGREE. JUST FOUR MONTHS AFTER THE LAW TOOK EFFECT THIS WAS SENATE BILL TWENTY SEVEN THAT WE WERE INVOLVED IN ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS WORKED HARD ON FOR A COUPLE YEARS. THE DEPARTMENT ISSUED GUIDANCE WHICH WE FELT WAS A MISINTERPRETATION OF THE LAW THEY TOOK IT DOWN. SINCE THEN WE'VE HAD THIS ONGOING CONCERN THAT THEY ARE TIGHTENING IT UP. THROUGH THE THINGS WE ARGUED ABOUT AND DEBATED AND CRAFTED WITH SENATOR HOLES GUIDANCE AND OF AN AUTHORITY. ARE TRYING TO BE REOPENED IN THE WAY WE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THE FLEXIBILITY NEEDED FOR VETERINARIAN SO WE WANT TO SEE IT TIGHTENED DOWN SO THAT THE INTENT. OF THE LAW IS IMPLEMENTED THANK YOU. MY MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS NO KRAMERS OF CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION. I WANT TO REITERATE A POINT THAT SECRETARY ROSS MADE CALIFORNIA REALLY IS A LEADER. IN. TAKING STEPS TO EXPAND. OVERSIGHT OF USE OF ANTIBIOTICS WE HAVE DRAMATICALLY CHANGED THE MANAGEMENT OF ANTIBIOTICS IN CALIFORNIA. NO LIVESTOCK PRODUCER CAN SIMPLY GO AND PURCHASE ANTIBIOTICS OVER THE COUNTER ANYMORE. THEY HAVE TO HAVE OVERSIGHT OF A VETERINARIAN TO USE THOSE ANTIBIOTICS I THINK THAT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE. WE SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME NEGOTIATING WITH SENATOR HELL AND OTHERS ON. SB TWENTY SEVEN. WE FELT IT VERY IMPORTANT THAT VETERINARIANS MAINTAIN. THERE DISCRETION AS TO WHEN ANTIBIOTICS SHOULD BE USED AND WHEN THEY SHOULD NOT BE USED. AND WE BELIEVE SB TWENTY SEVEN THE LANGUAGE AND SB TWENTY SEVEN. LEAVES THAT DISCRETION WITH THE VETERINARIANS IT PROVIDES GUIDANCE IT PROHIBITS THE USE OF ANTIBIOTICS FOR GROWTH PROMOTION. BUT IT DOES ALLOW THE VETS TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION AND CARE FOR ANIMALS THAT NEED. MEDICAL CARE. WHAT? THE OTHER FOLKS ON THAT HAVE MEANT HAVE TESTIFIED THIS MORNING WANT. IS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO COME BACK AND MAKE CHANGES AND INSERT ITSELF INTO THOSE MEDICAL DECISIONS WE THINK IT'S VERY. DANGEROUS FOR THE STATE TO BE MAKING THOSE DECISIONS WE THINK THAT THAT SHOULD BE LEFT TO THE DISCRETION OF THE VETERINARIANS. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT CDF PHASE I'M IMPLEMENTATION OF SB TWENTY SEVEN AND WANT TO SEE THE BCP. APPROVED AND. CDFA HAS DONE A LOT OF WORK THEY'VE ALREADY SURVEYED COW CALF PRODUCERS ON ANTIBIOTIC USE THEIR PLANNING TESTS ON SEND OUT A SURVEY TO SHEEP PRODUCERS TO GATHER DATA ON ANTIBIOTIC USE. ON THE CALIFORNIA ANIMAL HEALTH AND FOOD SAFETY LAB HAS DEVELOPED A. OF MANAGE A SYSTEM THAT CAN THAT VETERINARIANS CAN BRING SAMPLES AND THEY CAN TEST WHETHER OR NOT THAT BACTERIA IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE ANTIBIOTICS OR IF THERE'S RESISTANCE. WE NEED. MORE FUNDING TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE IMPROVEMENTS AND THOSE CHANGES CAN CONTINUE TO BE IMPLEMENTED SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO BE THE LEADERSHIP SO WE STRONGLY SUPPORT. THE BCP AND ASK THAT YOU A. FIND THAT WITHOUT A FURTHER DICTATING USE OF ANTIBIOTICS THE ARAB AT IF I COULD ASK A QUESTION. I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS. HOW THEN DO YOU INTERPRET? THE LANGUAGE TREAT GUARDING CUT OUT REGULAR PATTERN OF ADMINISTRATION. SO WE BELIEVE THAT THERE'S A PROHIBITION ON THE REGULAR USE CORRECT RIGHT SUPPORT SO. WHAT'S INTERPRETATION THAT YOU ARE ASKING IF YOU ARE USING ANTIBIOTICS IF IF A VETERINARIAN. IS ALLOWING THE USE OF ANTIBIOTICS. JUST. CONTINUALLY WITH OUT AN IDENTIFIED HEALTH RISK THAT WOULD BE REGULAR. DENNIS ALBION AB HAVE THE CALVET GRAIN FEED BECOMES BECAUSE OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA EGG FARMERS. IN THE PACIFIC EGG AND POULTRY ASSOCIATION. WE. ARE SB TWENTY SEVEN IS THE MOST PROGRESSIVE AND FRANKLY RESTRICTIVE. OF. A BILL IN THE COUNTRY BEING IMPLEMENTED YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR AND AND. EIGHT EACH STEP. BUT THERE WAS VERY CAREFUL NEGOTIATIONS ON THIS ONE ADMINISTRATION WITH. THE THE PROPONENTS AND AND OURSELVES A LIVESTOCK INDUSTRY ON HOW THEY SHOULD BE. A IMPLEMENTED AND AND MANAGED AND PROVIDING ALLOWING THE VETS TO BE ABLE TO USE THEIR. UP MEDICAL DISCRETION ON. WHEN AND HOW AND ABOUT IT SHOULD BE UP PROVIDED. IT IN FOR ANIMAL HEALTH WAS VERY CRITICAL TO THE DISCUSSIONS AND. UP. TO ALL SIDES INVOLVED IN SO REVISITING THIS ISSUE NOW IN IN IN A B. C. P.. A WE BELIEVE SHOULD BE PUT OFF. UNTIL A UNIVERSE STATUTORY DISCUSSION OF THAT'S WHAT THE PROPONENTS OF THIS. PROVISION WOULD LIKE TO DO THANK YOU. MY MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JUST AN OLD FIELD WITH THE CALIFORNIA CATTLEMEN'S ASSOCIATION I WANT TO. RECOGNIZE ON THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE HEALTH REFORM YEAR ASSOCIATE OURSELVES WITH THOSE I DO ALSO WANT TO MAKE A COUPLE OF A VERY BRIEF POINTS. ONE OF WHICH A CERTAIN WHEN I THINK OF THE DEPARTMENT FOR WORKING CLOSELY WITH STAKEHOLDERS I THINK THE SECRETARY MENTIONED. ARE THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS IT'S NOT JUST THE LIVESTOCK INDUSTRY. THE SAME FOLKS THERE APPEAR TESTIFYING TODAY ARE ALSO PART OF THAT STAKEHOLDER PROCESS FOR THESE DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN ONGOING AND AND ARE NOT NEW. BUT I ALSO WANT TO REITERATE THE FACT THAT THAT SB TWENTY SEVEN WAS AS I MISTER ALBION HE SAID CAREFULLY NEGOTIATED. A THAT WAS NOT. WINDOW DRESSING THAT WAS A SIGNIFICANT LEFT THAT OCCURRED AND WE'VE HAD TO HAVE SOME VERY DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS WITH RANCHERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND THAT HAS RESULTED IN A ONE AS MISS KRAMER'S MENTIONED. NO ANTIBIOTICS BEING SOLD. OR USED WITHOUT A PRESCRIPTION. ISSUED BY A VETERINARIAN. AND ALSO PARTICIPATION BY THE INDUSTRY TO NOT JUST COLLECT SALES DATA BUT ACTUAL ON FORM USE OF ANTIBIOTICS THIS ISSUE IS NOT ABOUT SALES THIS ISSUE IS ABOUT COMBATING RESISTANCE. AND WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW RESISTANCE. WORKS HOW THE PATTERNS TREND AND ULTIMATELY WE ARE ENGAGED IN DOING THAT. YOU KNOW WE HAVE A VESTED INTEREST AS LIVESTOCK PRODUCERS AND MAINTAINING THE EFFICACY OF THESE DRUGS HAVING ANTIBIOTICS THAT DO NOT TREAT. ANIMAL DISEASES. IS IS JUST AS. A DANGEROUS FOR US AS IT IS. FOR FOR THOSE APPEAR. TESTIFYING AGAINST SB CP SO I DO WANT TO SAY. YOU KNOW WE WE SUPPORT THE B. C. P.. AND I WOULD ASK THAT YOU. YOU FUND IT. WITHOUT. WITHOUT CONDITIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MADDIE DUNLOP ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA POULTRY FEDERATION I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SUPPORT THIS BCP AND ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITH THOSE OF OUR COLLEAGUES NO LIVESTOCK INDUSTRY. MR TURN MEMBERS TRICIA COUNTER WITH AGRICULTURAL COUNCIL CALIFORNIA ALSO AFFILIATING OURSELVES WITH THE COMMENTS OF THE CATTLEMEN'S ASSOCIATION AND CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU. VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT OF DEFACED BCP ON IMPLEMENTATION OF SB TWENTY SEVEN AS IT STANDS THINK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS CRISTINA CAR REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WHERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE CDFA REQUEST THE BCP. OF FOR THE MOST AGGRESSIVE ANTIBIOTIC REDUCTION OF PROGRAM IN THE COUNTRY. I'D ALSO LIKE TO SAY THAT WE FEEL AS VETERINARIANS THAT THE LANGUAGE IN S. B. TWENTY SEVEN IS ABUNDANTLY CLEAR. AND I COULD FURTHER AND JUST ONE LAYER OF. ADDITIONAL PROTECTION UNDER A VETERINARY CLIENT PATIENT RELATIONSHIP WHICH IS REQUIRED THAT WE ARE WE ESTABLISH WITH OUR ANIMAL PATIENTS. IN OUR PROVISIONS IT SAYS A DRUG SHALL NOT BE PRESCRIBED FOR A DURATION INCONSISTENT WITH THE MEDICAL CONDITION OF THE ANIMAL WHERE ANIMALS WERE TYPE OF DRUG PRESCRIBED IN SO WE ARE ALWAYS COGNIZANT OF THE FACT. THAT WE'RE DOING THE ANIMALS NO GOOD IF WE OVER USE ANTIBIOTICS FOR OUR PURPOSES IN WHICH WE'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT THE KAREN TREATMENT OF THE ANIMALS THINK YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS JENNIFER FEARING ON BEHALF OF THE CENTER FOR FOOD SAFETY AND. I WAS ALSO INVOLVED WITH THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE ON SB TWENTY SEVEN IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND IN. WAS SAID BY AN EARLIER SPEAKER THAT ASPECTS OF A SB TWENTY SEVEN FEEL RESTRICTIVE WHILE IT WAS MEANT TO COME YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT TWO MILLION AMERICANS SUFFER FROM AND ABOUT POSSESS INFECTIONS EVERY YEAR AND TWENTY THREE THOUSAND DIE AND A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTOR TO THIS. IS A THAT HAS BEEN THE LONG OVER USE I'M OF ANTIBIOTICS IN THE INDUSTRY THE LIVESTOCK INDUSTRY AND WHILE WE ARE SUPER SUPPORTIVE OF THAT INITIATIVE HERE AND RECOGNIZE PROGRESS THAT THE INDUSTRY IS ATTEMPTING TO BE MADE. THAT THERE IS A FOR THERE'S A FOCUSED SET OF CONCERNS THAT THAT HAVE BEEN CONVEYED TO YOU AND EXPRESS QUITE WELL ON THE STAFF COMMENTS THAT THERE IS A NEED TO TRUE UP BEFORE CONTINUING TO INVEST IN THIS PROGRAM KIND OF TRUE UP THIS. OUTSTANDING QUESTION MARK THAT FOLKS HAVE ABOUT LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION IN FACT HEARING CDNAS OWN LANGUAGES SOMETHING THAT HELPS TO DRAW A CONNECTION INTO THE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION AND HOW CDFA IS IS REGULATING THAT'S TO MAKE SURE. ALL STAKEHOLDERS FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THE PROGRAM IS ROLLING OUT THE WAY IT WAS NEGOTIATED THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AARON ALRIGHT ON BEHALF OF BEARING YOUR INGELHEIM AND INTO INTEREST OF TIME ISN'T FROM THE LAST ONE I WOULD JUST SAY THAT WILL ASSOCIATE OUR COMMENTS WITH THOSE BUT FOR US. IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE BEGIN. THANK YOU SO ON MS ROSS THEM. BUT DID YOU WANT TO ADD SOME COMMENTS AND PERHAPS A IN DOING SO THERE ARE THERE ARE A COUPLE COMMENTS ONE. I MENTIONED AT THE VERY END OF MY TESTIMONY THAT THIS REQUIRES A GREAT DEAL OF COORDINATION. WITH THOSE ENTITIES THAT HAVE AUTHORITIES WHERE WHERE THE AUTHORITIES ARE AND ONE IS THE VETERINARY MEDICINE PORT. WHICH IS WHERE THE CREDENTIALING AND THE ON GOING LICENSING OF THAT MARION'S HAPPENS AND WHERE THEY HAVE THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY FOR GUIDANCE ON THAT. AS WELL AS THE BOARD OF PHARMACY'S I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT WE'RE NOT THE ONLY PLAYER THIS IS WELL COORDINATED. OUR STATE VETERINARIAN ON HAS SOME IDEAS ON HOW TO PROVIDE SOME CLARITY ON GUIDANCE WITHOUT GETTING INTO THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY THAT OVERSEES VETERINARIANS WE DO NOT. HAVE THAT BUT. WE WANT TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS WE HAVE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS BUILT. I ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WHILE YOU HEARD FROM THE RANCHING COMMUNITY. THE POULTRY FEDERATION OF OTHER LIVESTOCK PRODUCERS. ACCESS WAS VERY IMPORTANT IN THE DISCUSSIONS HERE THAT'S ANOTHER BALANCING THAT WERE REQUIRED TO MAKE. WE HAVE DIED LIKE YOU MEAN ACCESS FOR THE ANTIBIOTICS WHEN THEY ARE NECESSARY AND WHERE THERE ARE VERY RULED REMOTE AREAS. BUT ALSO IMPORTANTLY THINKING ABOUT ALL THE LIVESTOCK PRODUCERS IN THE STATE WHICH INCLUDE YOUTH WHO ARE AND AFFECT THEY ARE FOR EACH PROGRAMS MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE ALSO GETTING THE INFORMATION AND THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS AND UNDERSTAND THEY NOW HAVE TO HAPPEN ESTABLISHED. THAT MARRIED RELATIONSHIP FOR THE CARE OF THEIR ANIMALS AND FOR THE LITERALLY THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE VERY SMALL. IT'S EASY TO CALL THEM HOBBY FARMERS BUT THEY HAVE WEEKEND SPRATT'S THEY MIGHT HAVE A HERD OF TEN OR LAST. AND THAT. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ISSUES OF REACHING ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE IN ADDITION TO ALL OF THOSE THAT ARE PART. COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION OF LIVESTOCK. AND I JUST BOTH OF THE BALANCING THINGS THAT WERE REQUIRED TO DO HERE AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO BE AWARE OF JUST HOW FAR REACHING THIS PROGRAM DOES THE DEPARTMENT HAVE AN INTERPRETATION OF. OF WHAT. IT MEANS TO AT MINISTER IN A REGULAR PATTERN. ITS ARE CLICK ON AN AREA THAT SHE THERE'S DOCTOR JONES. THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING. SO THE REASON THAT. THERE'S LOTS OF PEOPLE THAT CAN UP LOTS OF WAYS YOU COULD. INTERPRET RECORD REGULAR PATTERN OF USE BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT. WHEN YOU'RE PRACTICING MEDICINE WHAT YOU NEED TO CONSIDER IS THE SPECIFIC ANIMAL ON THE SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE PACIFIC SPECIFIC PATHOGEN THE IMMUNE STATUS. AND YOU KNOW AS HUMANS WE PROBABLY ALL BEEN TO OUR DOCTORS SO WE CAN APPRECIATE THAT. IN ALL MY. MEDICAL COLLEAGUES IN THE HUMAN MEDICINE FEEL WOULD PROBABLY. FEEL THE SAME WAY THAT THEY NEED THE ABILITY TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL OF THOSE VARIABLES WHEN THEY HAVE TO MAKE A MEDICAL DETERMINATION ABOUT THE BEST COURSE OF PRACTICE. SO. WHEN YOU ASK WHAT THEY HAVE IS NOT JUST A QUICK ANSWER SO THE WAY WERE THAT THE WAY WE'RE INTENDING TO ANSWER IT. IS THROUGH OUR AND STEWARDSHIP AND YOU JUST ISSUES PRINCIPLES WHICH WE'RE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW THAT WILL BE MORE SPECIES SPECIFIC SO THAT OR PRODUCTION TYPE SPECIFIC SO THAT WE CAN PUT THOSE GUIDELINES. AND. PARAMETERS TO CONSIDER IN THEIR IN AGAIN WERE REALLY JUST TALKING ABOUT PREVENTATIVE USE SO. THAT'S A THAT'S A MINOR. THAT'S. WITH DUKE DID YOU DISHES YOU SINCE STORESHIP PREVENTED IT USE WOULD BE A VERY VERY MINOR. PART OF THE PRACTICE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE OR ANY KIND OF MEDICINE. I TAKE YOUR POINT. BUT AT SOME POINT THERE MAY STILL BE A NEED TO. INTERPRET WHAT IS MEANT BY ADMINISTERING A MEDICALLY IMPORTANT. DRUG IN A REGULAR PATTERN HE. INTERACT AND YOU'RE RIGHT I WAS NOT CLEAR ON THAT THAT'S MY QUESTION OKAY HIZO DO YOU HAVE A POLICY ON THAT OR IS THERE. SAID WHERE WHERE WHERE IS THE DEPARTMENT ON THAT SO OUR INTENT IS TO END QUOTE INCORPORATED CORPORATE THAT INFORMATION INTO OUR STEWARDSHIP OUR SPECIES ARE PRODUCTION TYPE SPECIFIC GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS. SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THOSE TOOLS TO HELP BUT CANARIANS MAKE THOSE DECISIONS AND ALSO TO HELP. PRODUCERS HAVE INFORMATION SO THAT THEY CAN BE THE SAME INFORMATION SO THAT THEY WON'T BE MAKING YOU KNOW. REQUEST THAT PROPS ARE INAPPROPRIATE DOES THE DEPARTMENT SEE IT AT UNDER A UNDER THE STATUTORY SCHEME OF THOSE PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE TO THE DEPARTMENT SEE IT AS. ITS RESPONSIBILITY TO OVERSEE AND AND FORCE. ON ON THAT ISSUE SO I THINK I'M GOING TO GET AT THE HEART OF THE MATTER THAT'S RAISED BY TWO SITES AND I. TAKE IT THAT THERE IS A. CHASM BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES THAT AND. AND MOST SIDES FEEL THAT. THERE INTERPRETATION OF THE LAW IS QUITE CLEAR. YEAH ACTUALLY I DON'T I WOULD. RESPECTFULLY SAY I DON'T THINK THERE IS A CHASM WERE USING DIFFERENT WORDS BUT I THINK WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA MOVE IN THE SAME DIRECTION. SO I THINK AS YOU SEE THIS PROGRAM MATURE AND WE HAVE A REPORT THAT WILL BE YOU KNOW DO THE LEGISLATURE NEXT YEAR. SO YOU SHOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE GRABS NOT RATHER THAN THAN. YOU KNOW. REF OFF OF MY USE OF OF LANGUAGE. LET'S FOCUS ON THE LANGUAGE THAT'S ACTUALLY IN DISPUTE MAYBE IT'S NOT A CHASM MAYBE IT'S A VERY NUANCED DIFFERENCE WHATEVER IT IS THERE'S A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION AND MY QUESTION. THAT I WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND IF IF THERE'S AN ANSWER TO IS OF WHETHER OR NOT THE DEPARTMENT. AT THIS POINT IN TIME HAS A PLAN TO ADMINISTER THAT PARTICULAR. AND AND AND AND DO SOME ENFORCEMENT IF ENFORCEMENT WERE TO BE NECESSARY BECAUSE I. I I I I I HEAR THE AGRICULTURE SIDE OF FOR THIS DEBATE SAYING LEAVE IT TO THE. THAT TO THE VETERINARIAN TO MAKE A DETERMINATION JUST LIKE IF I WERE TO GO TO MY PHYSICIAN AND THE PHYSICIAN SAYS YOU NEED AN ANTIBIOTIC. WE'RE LEAVING IT TO THAT POSITION HOWEVER. HUMAN DOCTORS AS YOU AS YOU PUT IT DON'T HAVE A STATUTE THAT SAYS. GET TO A AT A REGULAR PATTERN. LEAST SWORDS I'M AWARE. OF. AND SO WHETHER IT'S RIGHT OR WRONG THE LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED A LAW THAT IT CURES TO. A DROP IN YOUR LAP. AYE A OVERSIGHT ENFORCEMENT ISSUE WHEN. MS ROSS YOU LOOK LIKE YOU ARE JOB BUT I JUST WANNA SAY THAT PART OF OUR VISITORS ITEM OPEN BY THE WAY ASTRONAUT YEAH HIGHER. IT'S A THEORY WHERE YOU ARE DISCUSSION AND WE WILL BE ENGAGED IN THIS WITH OLIVER STAKEHOLDERS AS WE IMPLEMENT THE SLOT. BUT THE COLLECTION OF THE DATA. AND THOSE USE PATTERNS WILL HELP US THAT'S WHAT WE'RE COLLECTING NOW THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO INFORM THE STEWARDSHIP GUIDELINES THAT WILL DEFINE FOR US SO THAT WE CAN SEE WHERE THE OUT WIRES ARE AND IDENTIFY. WHAT DOES SEEM TO BE A GLARING REGULAR USE THAT CALLS INTO QUESTION? BUT I ALSO HAVE TO KEEP POINTING OUT THAT WE DO NOT HAVE STATUTORY AUTHORITY OVER THE VETERINARIANS THEMSELVES THIS DATA ITS COORDINATION WITH THE VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD. THAT OVERSEES AND THEY ARE GOING TO BE REQUIRED FOR NEW EDUCATION AND OUTREACH TO VETERINARIANS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S ALL WORKING TOGETHER. WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY OVER WHAT'S BEING SOLD IN THE FEET STORES THE BOARD OF PHARMACY HAS AUTHORITY OVER THOSE THAT ARE GOING TO GO THROUGH AND GET A RETAIL LICENSE TO BE ABLE TO BE A PHARMACY FOR DISPENSING THESE PRODUCTS. THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT REQUIRE US ALL TO WORK CLOSELY TOGETHER BUT THIS IMPLEMENTATION PHASE THAT WERE IN IS ALSO ABOUT COLLECTING THE DATA. TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUALLY AND FORM THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND TO KNOW WHERE THAT OUT LIARS ARE AND WHAT IS WHAT IS CREATING. THE PROBLEMS AND ADDRESS THEM VERY SPECIFICALLY I. THEY'VE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY IS THE THE ENFORCEMENT THAT YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT IS TO THE VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD AND WE HAVE. YEAH XIN SHIP WITH THEM AND THE LAN FACT. ALLOWS US TO PROVIDE SOME CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION TO THEM IT HAS A PROVISION TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT SO THAT WOULD BE THE ALBANY FOR ENFORCEMENT. OKAY WELL OF LOT MORE TO DISCUSS I APPRECIATE THAT. THE THE FEEDBACK GUY MISTER MULLIN STRONG. THANK YOU AS CHAIR AND THANK THE DEPARTMENT OF FOR THE DISCUSSION. WHEN I HEAR THE PHRASE IMMUNE STATUS I KNOW THAT THIS MUCH OF THIS CONVERSATIONS PROBABLY ABOVE MY PAY GRADE HERE. BUT I DID CARRIED SOME LEGISLATION ON. ANTIBIOTIC USE ULTIMATELY A SENATOR HILLS BILL NOT PREVAILED. THAT'S NOW THE STATE LAW YEAH I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT IMPLEMENTED I KNOW THERE'S LOTS OF CONVERSATIONS HAPPENING IN THAT REGARD IT. I GUESS. AFTER HEARING PUBLIC COMMENT AND AND THE EXCHANGE AIP I PROBABLY NEED A LITTLE MORE CLARITY. THIS GOING FOR IT I SUSPECT AT ALL SUPPORT ULTIMATELY SUPPORT THE ITEM. AND I THINK I HEARD IN THERE SOMEWHERE THAT SOME ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE WILL BE. PROVIDED BUT MAYBE BABY FROM THAT DIRECTOR IF YOU IF YOU COULD MAYBE JUST KINDA AMPLIFY THAT POINT AGAINST THE THOSE CONCERNED WITH THIS. ARE REALLY SEIZING ON THIS ISSUE AROUND. PREVENTIVE YOU SEND SOME ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES SO OR GUIDANCE ARE SO. IT'S DEPARTMENT COMMITTING TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE AS PART OF THIS STAKEHOLDER CONVERSATION AND YET GOING YEAH. YES ABSOLUTELY THAT'S THAT'S PART OF THE DISCUSSION MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE STAYING AT THAT OUR STATUTORY AUTHORITY. THAT WE CAN DO IT IN A WAY THAT'S NOT. PRESCRIBING. ABOUT A VETERINARIAN SHOULD BE DOING I MEAN THERE ARE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS ARE SCIENCE PROFESSIONALS THAT ARE ABOUT HALF REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ON GOING LICENSING. BUT YES WORK WE'RE COMMITTED TO DOING THIS BASED ON DATA BASE ON SCIENCE AND BASED ON PUTTING TOGETHER THE STEWARDSHIP GUIDELINES THIS IS ABOUT AND AND I HOPE THAT I I THOUGHT IT CAME THROUGH FOR THE LIVESTOCK SECTOR. THE CALIFORNIA PRODUCERS HAVE MADE A COMMITMENT TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S NOT BEING REQUIRED IN OTHER PLACES AND THEY'RE VERY SINCERE AND THAT COMMITMENT BUT IT IS. IT IS TRANSFORMATIVE CHANGE. WITH THE RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR VETERINARIAN OF SOME OF THE SMALL FARMERS THAT MAY NOT HAVE AN ON GOING THAT IN A RELATIONSHIP. ON AND SO WE'RE VERY COMMITTED TO DOING THAT AND I ALSO HAVE TO SAY. THE FOCUS ON COMING UP WITH GUIDELINES FOR YOUTH WITH THEIR YOUTH PROJECTS ALSO CREATES A NEW GENERATION THAT'S AWARE OF SOMETHING THAT. THAT TRADITIONAL PRODUCERS. WE DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE THEM THAT TWENTY YEARS AGO SO I THINK WE'RE VERY COMMITTED TO DOING THAT WHETHER I'M SECRETARY OR NOT OUR PROFESSIONAL STAFF IS VERY COMMITTED TO THE S. AND I WILL SAY. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO BRING ON SOME OUTSTANDING NEW VETERINARIANS AS WELL AS ANIMAL HEALTH PRACTITIONERS THAT. ART THEORY FOCUSED ON DOING THIS AND DOING IT THE RIGHT WAY. AND THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT YOU ANTICIPATE HAPPENING. ARE HAPPENING HERE BUT THEY'RE NOT REALLY HAPPENING ACROSS THE COUNTRY REDDING CALIFORNIA IT LEVEL LEADING THIS CONVERSATION NATIONAL YEAH AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. THROUGH. THROUGH AT ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO REQUIRED THAT NIGHT FEET DIRECTIVES. THAT THAT DEAL WITH THE AVAILABILITY OF ANTIBIOTICS BUT NOT IN STATURE STATUTE THE WAY THAT WE ARE. ON THERE'S COLLECTION OF DATA BUT NOT TO THE EXTENT THAT WE ARE. A MINISTERIAL PORTENT TO REMEMBER THAT AS A PRODUCTION STATE EVEN WITH THE LIKES OF POPULATION NUMBERS WE HAVE. WE STILL BRING A LOT OF OUR MEAT PRODUCTS FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY SO WHERE ADDRESSING SOMETHING IN CALIFORNIA. BUT IT'S IT AND I THINK IT WILL HAVE INFLUENCE BUT IT'S ALSO BEAT TO BE MINDFUL THAT A LOT OF OUR MEAT PRODUCTS PROTEIN PRODUCTS TO COME FROM OTHER STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES. WELL FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE IT'S A FASCINATING ISSUE IT MOUNTED IT US BUT YOU'RE ALSO INTO CHAT ACT COME OVER ANY TIME OR I'LL COME OVER WITH OUR STAFF TO GET INTO THIS MORE DETAIL IF YOU'D LIKE TO. THAT WOULD BE GREAT TO. I'M SURE WILL. HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONSIDER IT IN MORE DEPTH. AS SOON. A AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THE BUDGET PROCESS I'D. I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THE INTENT OF THE LAW AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THE. INDUSTRY IS STEPPING UP AND TAKING ACTION ON AN ISSUE THAT REALLY DOES AFFECT POURTANT TO. IT HAPPENS SOMETIMES THAT OTHERS AMBIGUITIES AND OTHER LAWS THAT WE DRAFT AND. THAT'S BEEN DROPPED IN YOUR LAP MS ROSS OF AND I CAN SENSE OF THE FACT THAT IT'S CREATED SOME INTERNAL TENSION. OF BUT OF ITS WILL TRY TRY TO WORK WITH YOU TO SEE IF WE CAN'T RESOLVE IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TO WORK ON THE WHOLE THAT ITE OPEN AND. RIGHT. YES AND THAT. WE'RE NOW GOING TO MOVE ON TO. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY. MR INJURY AS YOU'VE BEEN COOLING THEIR HEELS FOR AWHILE. I. RIGHT. WELL IMAGINE THE ALARMED THAT WAS UNSETTLING. KNOWN NOW IT WAS I WAS OUT OF THE OFFICE YESTERDAY AND AND GOT A LITTLE BIT OVER AMBITIOUS AND MY QUESTIONING OF THE STAFF THIS MORNING SEVERAL. AND THOUGHT WE COULD MAKE IT UP BY RUNNING OVER HERE BUT THE. I OVERESTIMATE MY ABILITY TO RUN THESE DAYS HIGH I THINK. IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING WELL ACTUALLY THERE'S SOME PEOPLE WHO GET A LOT OF REGULAR EXERCISE HERE I'M NOT ALWAYS ONE OF THEM. BUT IF I. CAUSE YOU TO RUN OVER TO GET A LITTLE EXERCISE I'M NOT GONNA. NOT GONNA FEEL BAD ABOUT THAT NOW IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S A GOOD LESSON FOR ME IN MANY WAYS AND THE ALSO IS VERY INSTRUCTIVE TO HEAR THE LAST OF THE OUTSIDE OF A. A DISCUSSION SO I I I BENEFITED FROM THEM WELL GOT A GOOD MORNING WE KEPT YOU WAITING. ALL THIS TIME HERE ONE ISSUE AND. AND IT'S SMALL GRANTS SO PERHAPS EVEN A SMALL I'M SURE THESE ARE SMALL GRANTS OF BIG IMPACT THOUGH SO WHEN IT YOU JUST LAUNCH INTO YOUR. A DISCUSSION OF. ISSUE ONE HOW WILL THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND GOOD MORNING. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WANNA THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. I HAVE. JANA GARCIA OUR SYSTEM SECRETARY FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE STUFF WITH ME TODAY AS WELL AS THE ERA GRANT OR MINISTRY TO OFFICER. GRANT ERIK JARVIS I APOLOGIZE. IN THE INTEREST OF TIME. LOVE AND LET ME BE BRIEF AND TO THE POINT. THAT ARE YOU HAVE WAITED THIS LONG ANYONE A LONGER AND A LITTLE BIT PROBABLY OKAY. NOW AT ITS STILL WISE TO BE VERY FAST SO. LET LET ME GET RIGHT TO THE POINT AND THAT IS THAT THAT. OBVIOUSLY OUR BUDGET SHOWS A A GREAT COMMITMENT TO. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW JUSTICE IN PARTICULAR. NOW THE AGENDA FOR TODAY DESCRIBES OUR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE SMALL GRANTS. BCP VERY ACCURATELY AND IN PARTICULAR WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH AND THAT BCP IS A LACK OF FUNDING FOR THE US SMALL GRANTS PROGRAM. AS YOU MENTIONED THE IT'S A A SMALL PROGRAM IN MANY WAYS IN THE GRANTS THEMSELVES ARE NOT VERY LARGE BUT IT'S BEEN A VERY INFLUENTIAL PROGRAMS THROUGH THE YEARS. WE'VE ISSUED. OVER A THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN GRANTS THAT SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE PROGRAM. BUT THERE'S NEVER BEEN A STABLE FUNDING SOURCE. OUR JUNE. TWENTY SIXTEEN VINYL JUSTICE REPORT TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE NUMEROUS SMALL GRANT PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN FUNDED BY THIS PROGRAM. AND THIS YEAR. WE'VE RECEIVED OVER US SEVENTY ELIGIBLE APPLICATIONS A TOTALING APPROXIMATELY THREE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN REQUESTED GRANT FUNDING. AND WE HAVE A MILLION DOLLARS TO COMMIT TO A WARD SO. AS TODAY'S AGENDA SUGGEST SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS PROVIDING FUNDING FOR NEXT YEAR. OUT AND. IT'S A ONE TIME REQUESTED AT THIS POINT. AND WHAT WE'D BE DOING IS REALLY TAPPING INTO SOME OF THE. PENALTY FUNDS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AT THE THE STATE WATER BOARD THE AIRBORNE CALORIE CYCLE AND ID TSC. TO FUND THE PROGRAM IN THE NEXT YEAR. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S AN ISSUE WITHIN THE DTS SEE BUDGET AND SO WE'D BE MINDFUL THAT AS WE'RE LOOKING THAT TO PROVIDE FUNDING. OF BUT WE DO WANT TO CONTINUE FUNDING THIS PROGRAM OF THE AND THE BY GETTING THIS FUNDING THAT ALLOW US TO TO REALLY. GO AHEAD WITH THE TRANSITION TALK TO THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION AND TALK ABOUT HOW THEY MIGHT WISH TO A FUND THIS PROGRAM IN THE FUTURE. SO THERE ARE. IS A QUESTION THAT'S RAISED IN THE. STAFF COMMENTS. USING SOME. ELEGANT LANGUAGE. SAYING THAT THAT TOXIC SUBSTANCE CONTROL ACCOUNT IS UNDER PRESSURE WHICH I US SOON MEANS IT'S. JUST ABOUT READY TO GO UPSIDE DOWN. AND THE THE QUESTION THAT'S RAISED AS IF IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN WHY RELY ON. ON THAT FUND. OUR HOPE WOULD BE TO GET THAT FUND. BACK AND TO A A PROPER BALANCE IS THAT THERE'S A STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE IN THAT FUND. I THINK THERE'S FUNDING THAT WILL CARRY US THROUGH THE NEXT YEAR AND. BUT WE DO NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE FUNDING FOR LONG TERM FOR THAT AT A PARTICULAR ACCOUNT. SO WE KNOW WE CAN'T RELIED IN THE LONG TERM. AND IF WE MAKE THE DETERMINATION THAT THERE'S NOT FUNDING TO TAKE OUT OF IT AND THAT THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR THAN WE WOULD CERTAINLY. NOT TAKE ANY FUNDING OUT OF IT BUT AREN'T YOU. ADVANCING AT THE FUNDS INSOLVENCY IF THAT'S WHERE IT'S HEADED BY TAKING MONEY OUT NOW THIS IS THIS IS A VERY VERY SMALL AMOUNTS AND AS I SAID WE. WE WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING THAT WOULD ADVANCE THAT INSOLVENCY IN THE LONG TERM. OFF OR THE SHORT TERM. WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THE STATUS OF THE ACCOUNT. AND IF WE DETERMINE THAT WE CAN'T TAKE ANY FINDING OUT OF IT WE WOULDN'T. OKAY THANK YOU. OKAY. THAT SAYS IT IS A PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE. ON THE SIDE OF. WHEN. WHAT? GOOD MORNING CHUCK MOSELY CALIFORNIA RELIEF. COME JUST SUPPORTING THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION OF FUN AS WE THINK IT'S AN EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF THE FUNDING FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR. AS YOU SAID MISTER CHAIR. SMALL GRANTS BIG IMPACT. GIVEN THAT THESE ARE FOCUSED ON SERVING UNDER SERVED AREAS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THESE ARE SOME OF THE MOST ACCESSIBLE FUNDS FOR THESE AD UNDERSERVED AREAS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WHEN IT COMES TO STATE GRANT PROGRAMS THE APPLICATION IN THE PROCESS. AND WE THANK YOU FOR THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION OR SUPPORT. WHAT HOURS WITH PASSES THAT ACTION NETWORKING CALIFORNIANS FOR PESTICIDE REFORM ALSO SUPPORT STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION AS IT'S BEEN PREVIOUSLY STATED THESE ARE SOME OF THE MOST IMPACTFUL DOLLARS ON AND IN LIGHT OF? PROBABLY DIMINISHING FEDERAL FUNDS RUN FINAL JUSTICE ISSUES WE THINK IT'S ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT TO MOVE THESE. ARE FUN FOR WE'VE SEEN THESE FUNDS USED FOR A VARIETY OF ISSUES IN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF. EXPOSURES TO ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANTS AND PROVIDE VALUABLE INFORMATION RESEARCH AND COMMUNITY OUTREACH THAT JUST CAN'T BE DONE BY ANYBODY ELSE. THANK YOU. SO WE HAVE A RECOMMENDATION TO APPROVE THIS ITEM IS BUDGETED AND JOBS. WE MIGHT AS WELL. YOU WERE WITH US BECAUSE OUR MOTION ON THIS ITEM. I'LL SECOND THAT. BLOOM. I. FALL. CHOLERA. MOHAN. PATTERSON. IT WILL HOLD THE ROLL OPEN ON NAFTA. AWAITING MR KARA'S ARRIVAL I THINK HE'S DUE BACK SHORTLY AND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THINK WE'VE BEEN HERE THIS MORNING. REPORTS SAYING AGAIN SOON. MY PLEASURE THANK YOU. WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO OUR LAST DEPARTMENT SAID TO BE HEARD FROM TODAY DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION DIRECTOR BUT I THINK IT'S HERE AND TO. I GUESS WE'LL GO THROUGH ALL THESE ITEMS AND TAKE UP PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE END NOTING THAT. I RECEIVED A LETTER. RELATING TO ISSUE NUMBER NINE ISSUES NUMBER NINE AND TEN. THAT'S THE. ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM IN THE REGULATORY FIELD INSPECTION PROGRAM ADD THAT BASED ON THAT LETTER WHICH WAS SIGNED BY A NUMBER OF MEMBERS OF BOTH THE. ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE WILL. HOLD THAT ITEM THOSE ITEMS OPEN. RATHER THAN TAKING A VOTE ON THEM TODAY. WELCOME. CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. GOOD MORNING OF TRYING TO KEEP THIS BRIEF AND IF YOU HAVE A BUSY DAY. THE FIRST SET OF BCP'S ARE RELATED TO THE THAT A DOG A RENEWAL PLAN TWO. THREE YEARS AGO WHEN I CAME ON BOARD WE PUT TOGETHER A PLAN FOR OVERHAULING. OUR REGULATORY PERFORMANCE AND. INCLUDED NUMEROUS ITEMS AND ITEMS INCLUDING THAT INTO THE BCP RELATED ARE RELATED TO THAT ONE IS A STAFFING. FOR ENFORCEMENT OF SIX POSITIONS. FIELDS INSPECTIONS STOP INCREASE OUR ABILITY TO FIELD INSPECTIONS AT TWENTY ONE POSITIONS. TO CONTINUE WITH THE WELL STAR IT OVERHAUL WHICH IS. OF THE GOOD NEWS IS IT'S ON TIME AND ON BUDGET AND AND IN FACT IN ABOUT A FEW WEEKS WE WILL RID RID. IT ROLL OUT THE CORE OF THAT NEW IT PROGRAM A STATEWIDE. AND THE AND THE NEXT PHASE OF IT WILL BE ROLLED OUT IN THE FALL. AND THE LAST NAME IS BASICALLY. A BUDGET ITEM TWO I IMPLEMENTED A CENTER LARS BILL THAT WAS PASSED LAST YEAR. SP SEVEN TWENTY FOUR. REGARDING DESERTED WELLS IN OUR PROGRAM TO. REGULATE MANAGED DESERTED WELLS. THE DESERT WELL THING FOR EXAMPLE WILL GIVE US THE ABILITY TO MORE AND MORE UNIFORM. AWAY IN A SYSTEMATIC WAY TO REMEDIATE THE LARGE NUMBERS OF DESERT WELLS AND FACILITIES IN THE STATE. WITH REGARD THE ENFORCEMENT BC HE WILL ESTABLISH A STATEWIDE ENFORCEMENT UNIT. WE BELIEVE ARE PROBABLY IF NOT THE ONLY ONE OF ONLY VERY FEW STATE AGENCIES THAT DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A DEDICATED ENFORCEMENT UNIT. OF THIS WILL GIVE US SIX POSITIONS FOR THAT A CORE TEAM TO ENFORCE VIOLATIONS ACROSS THE STATE. OF THE OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND WELLS THAT WE REGULATE. IT ALSO GIVES US EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY IS THE CAPACITY TO VERIFY COMPLIANCE WHEN VIOLATIONS ARE ISSUED AND THAT'S FOR. A FIELD INSPECTORS TO THE B. C. B. INCLUDES TWENTY ONE TO THE. NEW FIELD INSPECTORS. WE COMPARED OUR CURRENT STATUS WITH OTHER OIL PRODUCING STATES AND WE'RE ACTUALLY HAVE FEWER ON AVERAGE PER WELLS AND. A FEW INSPECTORS. AND THIS WOULD ACTUALLY BRING US ALL MORE CONSISTENT ALLOW US TO MOVE MORE COMPLETELY. OUR REVIEW. SITES WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN VIOLATIONS. IN ADDITION. YOU KNOW IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE I WANT TO EMPHASIZE WHEN I JUST ASKING FOR POSITIONS THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON TO IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO DO INSPECTIONS. ARE THIS INCLUDES A CENTRALIZED DISPATCHING SYSTEM BEFORE WE I CAME ON I WAS KIND OF A RANDOM ACTIVITY WHEN YOU DIDN'T INSPECTION NOT NECESSARILY PRIORITIZING. WE NOW PUT GPS DEVICES ON OUR ALL OF OUR FUEL VEHICLES WE DISPATCHED TO THE NEXT OFFICIAL WHERE WE CAN SO WE ACTUALLY GET PRIORITY SITES. AS EFFICIENTLY WE CAN WHETHER IT BE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WORN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES WHERE A TRAFFIC ISSUES ARE VERY CHALLENGING TO GET OUT TO SITES. WE'VE ALSO BEEN WE'RE EXPLORING A COUPLE OTHER THINGS ONE IS TO DO. RIGHT REMOTE ARE WITNESSING OF TESTS ARE USING A GEO CODED VIDEO CONFERENCING THIS IS SOMETHING WE'RE EXPLORING AND IN THE FUTURE WHICH WOULD MAKE OUR WORK MORE EFFICIENTLY. TO. FOR SOME TYPES OF TESTS. ARM. ON THIS SIDE AND WE'RE VERY WE'RE COUPLE WITH LA RECOMMENDATION THAT THIS ITEM THAT WE BASICALLY. WILL REPORT BACK ON THIS AND IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS. THE LAST ITEM AS I MENTIONED WAS THE I. T. PROGRAM. AGAIN IT'S GOING VERY WELL THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR ABILITY TO REGULATE OIL AND GAS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE'RE ON A VERY ARCHAIC SYSTEM ACTUALLY A SYSTEM WEIGHT WEIGHT BEHIND OTHER STATES. THIS SYSTEM HAS BEEN. THE GOOD NEWS IS FOR A MAJOR IT PROJECT LIKE THIS AND I WOULD BASICALLY FROM START TO FINISH. I WILL HAVE IN PLACE WITHIN THREE YEARS. WE'RE NOW AT THE. LIKE I SAID IN A FEW WEEKS WERE ACTUALLY ROLLING OUT THE CORE OF IT. THAT IT SYSTEM BY THE WAY INVOLVES WE'VE BEEN DOING TRAINING WORKSHOPS WITH OPERATORS AND THE INDUSTRY BECAUSE IT'S AS MUCH THEIR TOOLS AS OURS. ARE SO WE'VE BEEN DOING ACTIVELY TRAININGS FOR INDUSTRY BOTH. OPERATORS AND OUR DEPARTMENT ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. AND THEN THE LAST ITEM. LEE IS A. WE'RE DRESSED ARE REQUESTING A REALLY SMALL FINDING SUPPORT FOR TSUNAMI HAZARDS MAPPING THIS IS A WE'RE KINDA CALIFORNIA AS THE STATE OF THE ART STAY THE OUR EFFORT IN DOING THIS WHERE WE. LOOK AT COASTAL COMMUNITIESAND PROJECT WHEN THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT SIZE POTENTIAL TSUNAMIS. WHERE WHAT COMMUNITIES AND WHAT PART OF THE NEIGHBORHOODS WOULD ACTUALLY IMPACTED THIS IT'S BEEN DONE IN A FEW US SEVERAL COMMUNITIES ALONG THE COAST? THIS HAPPENING I WILL ALLOW US TO COMPLETE THAT. DOWN THE COAST AS A TOOL FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT PLAN FOR DISASTER. SO WITH THAT ALLAH WILL STOP AND HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS WITH ME I HAVE. I HAVE BEEN TURNER LEGISLATIVE DEPUTY ALSO HAVE OUR ADMIN DIRECTOR HERE IN THE AUDIENCE. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS AT THIS POINT MISTER PAUL. I JUST. ONE QUICK QUESTION MAYBE THE THE THE NAVY CAN CAN ELABORATE CERTAINLY THE OPERATIONS OF YOUR. DEPARTMENT HAVE A VERY LARGE IMPACT IN MY DISTRICT IN KERN COUNTY AND I APPRECIATE THE THE FEEDBACK AND AND AND AND THE AND THE ACCESS TO YOUR STAFF IN TERMS OF GETTING INFORMATION. CERTAINLY THERE IS A SIDE ISSUE THAT'S NOT RELATED TO THIS WHICH IS. THE THE CURRENT BACKLOG IN pYOU COULD JUST PROVIDE A LATE THAT AN UPDATE UNSURE WHAT THE CURRENT QUOTE CURRENT STATUS IS. SO THAT I MEAN I KNOW AS WE COMMUNICATED IS JUST MAYBE. IT'S SO THAT WOULD SOME CONFUSION AND THERE'S ONE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ALL OPERATING OFF THE SAME DATA AND INFORMATION SO YOU KNOW HOW MANY TOTAL PERMITS ARE THERE CURRENTLY BEING REVIEWED. WHILE THAT IF YOU CAN JUST PROVIDE ME WITH THAT INFORMATION OKAY SO. JUST A LITTLE BIT OF FRAME ON THAT SO AND WE'VE HAD THE BACK AS YOU KNOW FROM NEVER LEGISLATORS CONCERNED THAT WE HAVE WE'RE TATE WORSE BEING FEARLESS WHAT SLOWER THAN WE'VE BEEN IN THE PAST. FOR ISSUING NEW PERMITS FOR FOR DRILLING AND YOU PROJECT PERMITS ARM. IS JUST POLITICAL WITH THAT PERSPECTIVE THREE YEARS AGO THE LEGISLATURE WAS CONCERNED WE WERE ISSUING PERMITS WAY TOO FAST WITH AN ADEQUATE REVIEW. A NUMBER OF LEGISLATION FOR PAST OR. IN IN ADDITION THAT WE'RE OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE U. S. EPA FOR LACK OF A PROPER REVIEW. SO WITH THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS WE'RE STEPPING UP OUR SCIENCE IN TERMS OF REVIEWING NEW. INJECTION PROJECTS FOR VIEWING. WELL PERMITS THAT ADDITIONAL SCIENCE DOES TAKE MORE TIME. IN ADDITION THE THE LEGISLATURE IS VAST AND AND. WE NOW HAVE A LARGE MUCH BIGGER ROLE THE WATER BOARD TO DO A SIMILAR MORE THOROUGH REVIEWS SO THAT REVIEW COMES TO US ECHOES THE WATER BOARD. IS SO THAT SO THAT JUST INHERENTLY IS GONNA HAVE MORE TIME TO PROCESS AND THIRD. EYE IS THAT OUR DEPARTMENT. AND I SAY NO THERE BUT THEY'RE BUMPS AND INEFFICIENCIES THAT ARE MAKING THIS PROCESS EVEN LONGER THAN IT PROBABLY NEEDS TO BE. I EVEN WITH THOSE ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS BUT ONE OF THOSE IS IS THAT WITH THIS NEWS ENDEP SCIENCE EVALUATION. IT'S REQUIRING THAT WE GET A DAY. INFORMATION AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM THE INDUSTRY. AND I THINK ONE OF THE THE FRUSTRATIONS WITH INDUSTRY IS AS IT GOES THROUGH THE PROCESS THEY GET ADDITIONAL REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION. SO WE'VE TAKEN SEVERAL STEPS TO TRY AND MAKE THIS MORE TRANSPARENT. ARE MORE STRAIGHT FORWARD AND TO ELIMINATE. ANY INEFFICIENCIES AND MAKE SURE WE HAVE A THOROUGH SCIENTIFIC REVIEW. WITHOUT EXTENDING THE PROCESS EVEN MORE WE NEED TO. ONE OF THOSE IS WE. HAVE PUT TOGETHER AN ANIMAL YOU WITH THE WATER BOARD SET WE IT'S VERY CLEAR. HOW WE RELATE TO THEM HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION ETCETERA? THE SECOND IS WE PUT TOGETHER KIND OF A VERY CLEAR A CHECKLIST OF WHAT IS ALL THE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION THAT THE OPERATORS NEED TO SUBMIT SO THEY KNOW UP FRONT AND HOPEFULLY MOST ALL OF IT COMES IN AT THE VERY BEGINNING. AND THEY'RE NOT YOU KNOW THE PROCESS ISN'T BEING DELAYED FOR THAT INFORMATION SO FOR EXAMPLE OF ALL THE OUTSTANDING PERMITS RIGHT NOW. ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT OF THOSE HAVE BEEN HELD UP. I DO TOO WAITING FOR INFORMATION THAT WE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUESTED FROM THE OPERATORS. THE THE OTHER THINGS WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE CREATED IN IN THIS FRANKLY THIS IS DUE TO A LOT OF THE YOU KNOW THE INPUT FROM THE LEGISLATORS HERE WE'VE HAD A COUPLE OF. RICHARD COULD MEETINGS IS THE WORD I'D USE BUT COULD MEET AT YOUR CONSTRUCTIVE MEETINGS AND ONE OF THOSE IS KIND OF A SIDE ISSUE OF LACK OF TRANSPARENCY WHERE ARE THINGS THE PROCESS YOU KNOW AND FRANKLY THAT MIGHT LEAD TO SOME DELAYS. WITHOUT WE'VE NOW CREATED ONLINE BOTH US AND THE WATER BOARD IS A DASHBOARD WHERE YOU CAN TRACK THE STATUS OF THESE PERMITS AND WE'VE DONE THAT SENSE. MEETING WITH LEGISLATORS A FEW WEEKS AGO. I AM SO THERE'S ALL THESE THINGS AND AND AND. IT'S THE SAME TIME WE RECOGNIZE REALLY THERE IS THERE IS. EFFORT TAKING INCREASE EFFICIENCY HANDLE THESE THINGS FASTER AND AND MOVING FOR NOT UNNECESSARILY CAUSE DELAYS BUT I THINK THERE THERE WILL IT'S NOT. AND I THINK SOME FOLKS IS NOT IF IT IS A SOUND LIKE YOU RECOGNIZE IT AS A COMPLETE SEPARATE ISSUE FROM THE ISSUE OF ENFORCEMENT. AND COMPLIANCE INSPECTORS. BUT IT'S IN IT IN THIS CASE IT'S NOT SO MUCH AN ISSUE OF STAFFING. THE PRIMARY ISSUE IS THESE THESE INITIAL SIGNS OF REQUIREMENTS THE DISH OF STEPS THE PROCESS AND I WILL SAY SOME LACK OF. OF COORDINATION US SO THAT PROCESS AND PEOPLE KNOW WHERE THINGS ARE SO THEY CAN BIRD DOG AT THE RIGHT PLACE. SO THAT'S WHERE THINGS ARE AT I. TERMS THE ACTUAL NUMBERS ON. BEN TURNER CAN GIVE IT WHERE THINGS ARE SO THE THERE ARE A. ABOUT EIGHTY SIX PENDING YOU I SEE. PROJECT PERMITS. IN THOSE CORRESPOND ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED INJECTORS I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE HOW MANY PRODUCERS. BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WE DON'T EVALUATE THAT NECESSARILY WITH YOU I SEE PROJECT UNTIL WE COULD GET AN ALLY ON THAT. SO I APPRECIATE I APPRECIATE OUR WORK IN AND CERTAINLY THAT I THINK THAT THE CHALLENGE FOR US IS. IS THAT WHILE YOU'RE WHERE YOU'RE ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDS IT'S JUST THAT THERE'S THERE'S A. THE BAILIFF IN THE ROOM IN TERMS OF OF WHAT OUR PRIORITIZING SO JUST LIKE THAT CLEARS EIGHTY SIX PENDING YOU I SEE. PERMITS AND EIGHTY HUNT AND THAT INVOLVES EIGHT HUNDRED WELLS. GIVE OR TAKE A HUNDRED EJECTORS I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE HOW MANY PRODUCERS DOES CORRESPOND TO. THINK ABOUT MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED APPRECIATE THAT. THIS CRAP. UP I'M GONNA FORGO MY QUEST A BIG. BREAK FOR. ABOUT FOUR GOT MY QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW BUT I UNDERSTAND HOLDING OVER WE WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASK SOME ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS BEFORE WE VOTE WE ARE UPHOLDING THIS OPEN AND IT WILL COME BACK TO US AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC WOULD LIKE TO BE. AROUND THE SET OKAY THANK YOU APPRECIATE IT. OH I'M SORRY MR MALL AND YOU HAD A QUESTION. WAIT TILL. OKAY. BILL ALLEY OVER THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP WE SEVEN ONE OF THE LETTERS REFERENCED BY THE CHAIR I'M ALSO REPRESENTING. AND FOR US KHALFAN LEAVE CONSERVATION VOTERS SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL AND CLEAN WATER ACTION. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE GET A PERSPECTIVE ON THE TIMING OF THIS I WAS IN THIS ROOM. SEVEN YEARS AGO ON DOCTORS BUDGET I'M THE PERSON WALKED IN THERE IN JANUARY OF TWENTY LEVIN SAID DO WE FRACKING CALIFORNIA THEY SAID NO WE DON'T NEED TO. TURNS OUT THAT WAS NOT TRUE TURNS OUT WE UNCOVERED LOTS OF STUFF A DOCTOR THE INADEQUATE. OVERSIGHT OF THE UNDERGROUND INJECTION CONTROL PROGRAM INADEQUATE WELL STANDARDS IN ADEQUATE ENFORCEMENT THE LIST AND IT TURNS OUT AN ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT OF THE UNDERGROUND GAS STORAGE ISSUE WHICH BLEW UP IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND FOR A ONE YEAR DOCTOR BATTLED THIS LEGISLATURE AND THE PUBLIC ADVOCATES LIKE MYSELF. AND FIND A BECAUSE THEY WERE IN THE POCKET OF. THE OIL COMPANIES AND THAT'S THE WAY IT WAS YOU GOT YOUR PERMITS QUITE EASILY INCURRING COUNTY. AND IT'S IRONIC OR I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS HERE IS TODAY THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSING TO GET DARKER TO WHAT THEY NEED TO BE. WORDS IN TWENTY ELEVEN THE GOVERNOR FIRED. THE DIRECTOR CONSERVATION THE HEAD OF A DOCTOR FOR TRYING TO DO WITH THEIR DOING NOW WHICH IS GET ON TOP OF THE INDUSTRY NOT IN A BAD WAY. AS A STATE REGULATORY BODY WITH ENFORCEMENT ASKING FOR SCIENCE AND THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT SHOP ON OTHERS CAME CAME IN AND COMPLAINED ABOUT THEN. SAYING THEY'RE HOLDING UP OUR PERMITS THIS IS HURTING JOBS IN KERN COUNTY. SO YEAH IT TAKES A LITTLE MORE TIME FOR THESE THINGS BUT DON'T FORGET THAT THE BIGGEST INFLUENCE. ON THE RATE OF OIL PRODUCTION THE STATE AND MOVEMENT TO MARKETS IS THE PRICE OF OIL PER BARREL. NOT THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT SO NOW THEY'RE CRYING FOUL. WHEN THE DOG IS TRYING TO DO WHAT THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING ALL ALONG AND IT'S ONLY BEEN DOING AND TO THEIR CREDIT HAVE COME FORTH WITH. INITIATIVES BEFORE THIS BODY ON ENFORCEMENT ORPHAN WELLS IT'S CETERA. AND NOW BOUGHT BOBBING LEVELS ARE HIGHER THEY'RE FINALLY GOING TO DO THE JOB THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING SO LET'S GET HIM UP TO WHERE THEY SHOULD BE LIKE OTHER STATE REGULATORY AGENCIES ARE DOING A GOOD JOB NOW IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE STATE WATER BOARD. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE BCP'S THANK YOU. CHAIRMAN BLAIR MARK FRENCH MAKER FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND WERE ALSO ASSIGNED HER TO THE LETTER TO MISTER ELLIOTT WAS JUST REFERENCING I THINK YOU DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF COVERING ALL THE TALKING POINTS I WAS GOING TO BE GIVING HERE SO I'LL JUST SAY WE ARE IN. SUPPORT OF THE PEACE PEACE THANK YOU. MORE MATURE MEMBERS PAY AT THE THOMAS REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION. LIMITED TO SHED SOME LIGHT ON MY OPPOSITIONS COMMENTS FIRST AND FOREMOST MAY BE VERY CLEAR. PRODUCTION IS DOWN FIRST OF ALL LET ME THANK YOU FORHOPE HOLDING OPEN NINE ITEMS NINE AND TEN. AS WE WANT TO WORK WITH THIS AND WORK WITH DOG OR TO THE TRANSPARENCY ISSUES I WANT TO TURN THIS INTO A DEBATE NO SO HIS MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SO IF YOU COULD. RESTRICT YOUR COMMENTS TO THE TESTIMONY THAT'S BEEN HEARD HERE TODAY YES APPRECIATE THAT WERE IN SUPPORT OF. SB SEVEN TWENTY FOUR. D. OUT A WELL I'M ISSUES INSOFAR AS WE WORKED ON IT LAST YEAR WE ALSO KNOW THAT IN FACT. PRODUCTION IS DOWN. AND WE THINK THAT THE THAT THE SIZE OF DOG HAS DOUBLED. AND ONLY THING RESCIND IS NOT GENERAL FUND DOLLARS THESE ARE REAL DOLLARS FOR REAL COMPANIES TWENTY WE'RE ASKING IS THAT WHAT YOU JUST GRANTED MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THAT IS A SIMPLE. WORK WITH DOCKER WE'VE MET BUT THE ADMINISTRATION WE'VE MET WITH STAFF MET WITH YOUR STAFF MET THE DOCTOR. AND WITH THE END OF THE WE BELIEVE WE'RE GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. FOR THE MORAL SUPERIORITY CALMEST THE COMMON THAT WERE BAD PEOPLE THINGS THAT NEED TO THINK IT'S WRONG. IT JUST SIMPLY IT IS AND IT HAS TO BE RESPONDED TO MISTER CHAIRMAN BECAUSE IT DOESN'T ESPECIALLY IN OUR BUILDING HERE THE BOTTOM LINE IT IS A REAL PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT. THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO DEPEND ON THEIR PAYCHECK TO DO WHICH IS WHAT EVERYONE IS DOING HERE SUPPORT THEIR AMILIES AS ONLY THING WE'RE ASKING. SO FOR A REPORT TO BE CASTIGATED AS THE DEMONS I JUST THINK IT'S IRRELEVANT AND IT SHOULDN'T BE DONE IN THIS VENUE HERE WHICH HAVE AN HONEST POLICY DISCUSSION OR BUT A DISCUSSION. ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON SO ANYTHING I WOULD ASK. IS THAT WE HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH DOCTOR WE UNDERSTAND A PRODUCTION IS DOWN WE HOPE THAT IT WILL GO UP AT SOME POINT IN TIME BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS. AT DAY'S END WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REAL PEOPLE HERE IN REAL CALIFORNIANS AND IT SEEMS THAT THE OPPOSITION ON FORGETS THAT SO THANK YOU AGAIN MISTER CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU OF. SO WE WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN LA O. HAS. COMMENT SHOWN MY REAL PLEASURE THAT I THOUGHT THIS FOR FOR ISSUE NUMBER TEN THE REGULATORY FIELD INSPECTION. WE'RE RECOMMENDING THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON A THREE YEAR BASIS AND THERE'S SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF WORKLOAD THAT THEY'LL HAVE AND SO. THIS WILL CAUSE HIM TO COME BACK IN THREE YEARS AND RE JUSTIFY THE AMOUNT OF POSITIONS THAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR RUSS RECOMMENDING THAT YOU DONT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT REQUIRE THEM TO REPORT ON THE AMOUNT OF ON THE NUMBER OF. OILFIELD OPERATIONS THAT THEY ACTUALLY SENT INSPECTORS OUT TO OBSERVE IN THE FIELD. GREAT THANK YOU AND DEPARTMENT FINANCE ANY COMMENTS S. ENTER OLD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TIME WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH THE ALLELES RECOMMENDATION AND BELIEVE IT'S A REASONABLE COMPROMISE. THANK YOU OF MISTER MULLIN OF QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO. ON THIS ISSUE OF THE PERMIT BACKLOGS THAT HAS BEEN RAISED. I HEARD I HEARD YOUR ANSWER. TO THE QUESTION BUT IF I COULD JUST FOLLOW WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT. THE PERMIT APPROVAL TIME LINE IS APPROPRIATE YOU TALKED ABOUT THE HISTORY WHERE. THINGS ARE BEING APPROVED YOU QUICKLY WE'RE HEARING THAT PERMITS ARE NOT BEING APPROVED IN A TIMELY FASHION DO YOU THINK THAT. THE CURRENT PROCESS AND THE BACKLOG IS APPROPRIATE. OR. IN TERMS OF YOUR TIME LINE ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH THE WAY THINGS ARE OR DO YOU HAVE A PLAN TO ADDRESS THAT PERMIT BACKLOG WHICH WOULD. I GUESS INFERS THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM HERE THAT IT IS A SLOW PROCESS CAN YOU JUST FURTHER. AMPLIFIER COMMENTS I COULD UNDERSTAND HUNG WE'RE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE TIME LINE OR. THE FACT THAT. SOME PERMITS HAVE BEEN. TAKEN VERY LONG TO IMPLEMENT. BUT AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THERE'S ACTUALLY. A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH A MUCH THOROUGH MORE THOROUGH REVIEW THAT PART OF THAT TIME THOUGH WHICH WHERE. THERE'S INEFFICIENCIES AND HOW WE'VE INTERACTED BACK AND FORTH WITH THE WATER BOARD AND AND WHAT'S THE STATUS OF THINGS INEFFICIENCIES OF HOW WE'VE REQUESTED INTO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM INDUSTRY. I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS WE CAN DO TO DECREASE THAT TIMELINE. WE'RE NOT HAPPY WITH THE TIME WHEN OUR GOAL IS TO DO A THOROUGH SCIENTIFIC REVIEW IN THE QUICKEST TIME WE CAN DO WITHOUT SACRIFICING. YOU KNOW POTENTIAL THREATS TO GROUNDWATER CETERA SO I YOU KNOW I THERE'S CLEARLY SOME EXAMPLES. WHERE YOU KNOW IT? THEY'RE NOT GOOD ISN'T ISN'T EXAMPLES WHERE IT SHOULD HAVE TAKEN SO LONG TO REVIEW. US SO WE'RE CONSTANTLY LOOKING AT WAYS TO MAKE THAT A MORE EFFICIENT PROCESS. I ONE THING I WILL POINT OUT JUST IN TERMS THE WITH THE PRICE OF OIL BEEN MENTIONED A FEW TIMES AS IF. THEY. WHEN OIL DROPPED INTO TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN APPLICATIONS DROPPED IT WASN'T THAT WAY YOU KNOW AND BUT THEN WHEN YOU KNOW YOU WHILE OIL PRICES ARE DOWN THERE RISING AND AS SOON AS THEY START RISING WE GET A LARGE SLUG OF APPLICATIONS. SO PART OF THIS IS IT'S NOT LIKE APPLICATIONS FOR WOMEN AT A CONSISTENT LEVEL THEY TO GO UP AND DOWN AND SO PART OF IT AS. THEY CUT ME CAN'T IT STARTED COMING IN A RAPID LEVEL I AND. AN INNATE AND THEN WHEN THEY START COMING IN WHEN OUR JUST BEGINNING ALL THIS A NEW ADDITIONAL SCIENTIFIC REVIEW OF THIS LEGISLATURE ASKED ABOUT SO. I'D SAY THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF. YOU KNOW LEARNING CURVE GETTING THE NEW SYSTEMS IN PLACE OF VALUATION ONE THING THAT'S GONNA HELP A LOT I MEAN FRANKLY WE'RE STILL WRESTLING WITH PDS OF SCIENCE OKAY SO. WIND AS WELL STAR SYSTEM GET SAND THAT AND AGAIN IT'S STILL GOT ABOUT ANOTHER YEAR TO FULLY GET ALL PHASE TEN. PUTTING BOTH INDUSTRY IN US WILL BE ABLE TO SHARE EXCHANGE INFORMATION MORE RAPIDLY ON THE SCIENCE OF WELLS IN PROJECTS SO THAT WILL BE AN IMPORTANT THING. I WOULD SAY FOR ANOTHER SEVERAL MONTHS THOUGH WE'RE LITERALLY BEING GOING INTO THAT TRANSITION FROM. LIKE PAPER DOCUMENTS GOING BACK AND FORTH TO REALLY HAVING MORE THIS ONLINE SO NO I I MEAN WE'RE NEVER SATISFIED WHEN THINGS TAKE A LONG TIME. SO IT'S UP. IT'S A NEW DAY A DAUGHTER AND A BAD AND. THERE'S. MULTIPLE FACTORS IN THE EQUATION HERE THERE'S THE MARKET DYNAMICS. YOU FOLKS ARE TRYING TO RESPOND TO THESE MANDATES THAT WE'RE PUTTING ON YOU. WHAT I'M CURIOUS ABOUT IT AND THIS IS A GENUINE QUESTION HAVE NO IDEA IS THERE OR SHOULD THERE BE A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE LEVEL OF PRODUCTION WHICH IS DRIVEN BY A VARIETY OF FACTORS BUT THE LEVEL OF PRODUCTION? DOMESTICALLY IN CAL WITHIN STATE. AND YOUR STAFFING LEVELS IN TERMS OF YOUR. ENFORCEMENT SO THERE YOU KNOW TWENTY SEVEN NEW POSITIONS. WE'RE GONNA BE STAFFING UP I THINK. YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY. I SUPPORT. STAFFING UP TO MAKE SURE WE'RE WE'RE MEETING OUR OBLIGATIONS THAT WE THE LEGISLATURE PUT ON YOU BUT. IS THERE AT. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOUR STAFFING LEVELS AND THE LEVEL OF PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA WORSE ARE THOSE TWO THINGS KIND OF. NON LINEAR THOSE ARE ON THERE NOT LINEAR SO FOR EXAMPLE WHETHER IF PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE OF A REDUCTION APPLICATIONS ARE WORK RELATED DOWN. BUT IF PEOPLE'S YOUNG THROTTLE BACK ON HOW MUCH THEY'RE PRODUCING WE STILL HAVE TO REGULATE THOSE WELL HAS WHETHER THEY'RE ACTIVE IN ACTIVE. WE STILL HAVE TO DO SEEMS INSPECTIONS SO THE WORKLOAD FRANKLY FOR US WE STILL HAVE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND WELLS. TO TO MANAGE AND REVIEW SO THEY THE. THE WORKLOAD DOESN'T GO DOWN UP AND DOWN LIKE THAT WHEN PRODUCTION GOES UP AND DOWN. SO WHAT HAPPENS IS I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SOMEONE LEAN TO IS WHEN PRODUCTION GOES DOWN. THE AMOUNT OF COST PER BARREL. IN ITSELF WILL GO UP A LITTLE IN THE FEES. BUT. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE SO SO I DON'T THINK IT IS THAT CONNECTED I MEAN IT BECAUSE WE'RE STILL HAVING TO MANAGE THE SAME NUMBER OF WELLS AND PROJECTS. I IF. PRODUCTION WENT WAY UP OUR WORKLOAD INCREASE AS MORE YOU KNOW MORE ADS STRAWS ARE PUT IN THE GROUND SO TO SPEAK. SO I IT'S. NOT THAT IT'S HIGHLY RELATED BECAUSE A REGARDLESS OF WHAT'S GOING ON TO WELL WE STILL HAVE TO REGULATE IT CHECK BLOWOUT PREVENTERS INSPECT AMON ALL LIKE I THINK. BECAUSE THOSE INSPECTIONS AROUND SCHEDULES YOU KNOW TO KEEP THINGS SAFE NOT ON WHETHER HOW MUCH THEY'RE PUMPING AT A GIVEN TIME. AND I WILL BELIEVE AT THIS POINT. ANYMORE MISTER CHAIR BUT. MY. UNEDUCATED NON EXPERT UP. VIEW OF OIL IN CALIFORNIA FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD IS THAT. THERE WERE PROMISES OF LOTS OF PRODUCTION WITH MODERATION ALE BUT.% AS FOLKS. YOU KNOW DID THE FRACKING AND REALLY GOT INTO IT IT SORT OF. DIDN'T REALLY MATERIALIZE TO THE EXTENT THAT. THE INDUSTRY HOPED LET'S PUT IT THAT WAY. IS THAT IS THAT ACCURATE AS WANT TO KNOW THAT MY OWN KIND OF FRAMING ON THIS. IS ACCURATELY WHAT IS THE STATE OF OF PRODUCTION. FROM YOUR STANDPOINT. IN IN CALIFORNIA AND SORT OF PROJECTING GOING FORWARD YOU KNOW AT THERE WAS A MOMENT THERE WERE PEOPLE THAT THERE SHOULD BE NEW OIL BOOM OR SOMETHING IN CALIFORNIA. IN BAND WHO IS MY FORMER LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR KNOWS TONS MORE ABOUT THIS THAN I DO BUT IT AND MY INFORMATION WAS. FROM HIM BUT IS THAT STILL. KIND OF THERE IS THAT THE STATE OF AFFAIRS IN CALIFORNIA WITH MY BREAK A BRIEF COMMENT IF YOU WANT MORE I COULD ASK OUR CHIEF DEPUTY OIL SUPERVISORS HERE BOB MARLEY. WHO IS BASED IN KERN COUNTY I MIGHT ASK CAN COME UP BUT? GENERALLY IT'S FALLING PRICE I MEAN YOU KNOW REGARDLESS OF YOU KNOW. WHAT TECHNIQUES ARE USED IT WHEN PRICE WENT DOWN PRODUCTIONS GONE DOWN AND INVESTMENT GOES DOWN NUMBER RIGS IN THE STATE GOES DOWN? RIGHT NOW ACTUALLY NEVER RIGGS IS GOING UP AND YOU KNOW SO. AND. I YOU KNOW WHEN WE CAN'T I CANNOT I DO FEEL LIKE A MORE DETAILED ANALYSIS SO IT BUT WHEN SO IT'S DRIVEN BY THE PRICE. NOT NECESSARILY THE CONDITIONS. IN THE GROUND. WELL IT'S BOTH I MEAN IF I EVER BUY. IT. YOU THINK IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE TO REMOVE IT DOWN THAT PRICE HAS TO BE HIGHER TO GET IT OUT OF THE GROUND. SO I'M YOU KNOW BUT IT STILL MOVES WITH PRICE. BY A MIGHT BE. LESS OF THE OIL IS. ECONOMIC TO PULL OUT OF THE GROUND. WHEN PRICES GO DOWN AND AND AND AND MAYBE NOT AS ECONOMICAL YEARS AGO WHEN IT WAS EASIER TO GET OUT OF THE GROUND. SO IT IS STILL FLUCTUATES WITH PRICE YEAH. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. RIGHT AS A CLOSING COMMENT AT A PLACE SO I JUST LIKE WANT ME TO COMMENTS IS. LAST WEEK A P. RAN A NATION WIDE ARTICLE ABOUT. THE FACT THAT. THERE WAS LIKE FIVE HUNDRED FORTY THREE VIOLATIONS IN COASTAL AND OFFSHORE FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA. THAT RAN NATIONWIDE FORTUNATE THE STORY DIDN'T. THEY DIDN'T TAKE ENOUGH TIME TO LET US. LOOKS AT HOW MANY OF THOSE WE'VE VERIFIED HAVE COMPLIED AND FIX THE PROBLEM. BUT OF THOSE OF A FOREIGN FIVE HUNDRED FORTY THREE A HUNDRED ALL BUT A HUNDRED FOUR HAD BEEN EITHER TAKEN OUT OF PRODUCTION ORDER VERIFIED WITH COMPLIANCE. SO THAT LEAVES IS BASICALLY NINETEEN PERCENT OF THOSE. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO GO VERIFY. THEY'VE ACTUALLY COMPLIED WITH THE VIOLATION ORDER I MEAN THE. NOTICE OF VIOLATION THAT THEY NEED TO FIX SOMETHING. AND I LITERALLY IS TO DEAL WITH ONE OF THE BODIES TO GO OUT AND AND SEE A WALL SETS IN THAT CASE IT WAS NINETEEN PERCENT OR A HUNDRED FOUR OF THEM. NOW THEY MAY HAVE COMPLIED WE DON'T KNOW WE USED TO HAVE PEOPLE TO GO OUT AND SEE IT. IN THE LAST TWO SHOWS ONE MADE ABOUT THE FEE IS THAT. WE'RE ACTUALLY BELOW ALL THE OTHER MAJOR OIL PRODUCING STATES IN THE SIZE OF OUR FEE FOR OUR OIL REGULATORY SYSTEM WE'RE NOT IN AN UNUSUAL WAY. WE'RE NOT UNUSUAL AT ALL AND. IT'S OUR INTENT THAT WE HOPE THE FEES GO DOWN I WANT ONE OF THINGS I MENTION THAT IS FOR EXAMPLE I THINK IN THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS IT PROBABLY WILL GO DOWN A LITTLE BIT. BECAUSE THIS WELL STAR PROGRAM WAS A BIG BUBBLE OF COST IT WAS TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS LAST YEAR. FIFTEEN THIS YEAR IT'LL BE FIVE NEXT YEAR BUT YOU AND THAT IS GONNA GET DOWN TO ABOUT ONE POINT THREE. SO IT'LL BE A YOUNG TURNS ON GOING SO BUT IT WAS THIS HUGE BUBBLE OF COST THAT THIS HE IS PAYING FOR. SO THERE WOULD LIKELY WILL BE A DECREASE IN THE IN THE IN THE REQUIRED. DOLLARS FOR DOING OUR JOB NOW. ALSO THAT FEES WILL BE AFFECTED BY IS AFFECTED BY HOW THE PRICE IS. NOT A PRODUCTION. BUT I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT I DON'T THINK WE'RE AN UNUSUAL STAY IN FACT WE'VE BEEN BELOW OTHER STATES IN TERMS OF WHAT WE CHARGE FOR REGULATORY PROGRAM. AND TWO THAT WE STILL HAVE WORK TO DO TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN PLAN A INSURE THAT OPERATORS. ARE OPERATING SAFELY AND AND THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT IS TO HAVE INSPECTORS AND ENFORCEMENT TEAM. THANKS SO. BUT LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THAT NINETEENPERCENT YEAH. THAT WERE OUT OF COMPLIANCE OUT OF THE FIVE I KNOW IT WAS FIVE HUNDRED FORTY THREE VIOLATIONS THAT WE ISSUED. AND. OF THOSE. ARE ALL ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FOUR WE EITHER VERIFIED THE FIX THE PROBLEM WORD THEY WERE TAKEN OUT OF PRODUCTION FOR EXAMPLE. IT'S QUITE AN ABOUT HALF AS WELL ABOUT IT. TO ABOUT A. FORTY PERCENT OF THOSE ARE TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT RUN RINCON ISLANDER PLATFORM HOLLY WHICH WITH THE STATES TAKING BACK CONTROL OF RINCON ISLAND IS NOW REMEDIATING THE ISLAND. AND PLATFORM HOLLY IS YOU KNOW BASICALLY BEING REMEDIATED NOT PRODUCING WELL I I WANT TO FOCUS ON THE HUNDRED AND SEATTLE HER FOR A. WHAT IS THE PLAN FOR ADDRESSING THOSE OF? HOW MUCH I DON'T THINK IT'S? IT WILL BE OUR GOAL IS TO GET OUT TO ME AS SOON AS WE CAN WITH THE STAFF THAT WE HAVE I MEAN I I THINK WE HAVE A CHART HERE IT SAYS HOW MANY THINK ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED. WELL HEADS PER INSPECTOR WE'RE TRYING TO GET THAT DOWN TO ABOUT EIGHTEEN HUNDRED WELL HAD SPRING SPECTER. SO THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM JUST THE COAST AS A PROBLEM STATEWIDE IT WE WE LACK ADEQUATE INSPECTORS. TO FULLY GO OUT ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH VIOLATIONS. IS THERE A A TIME LINE WITHIN WHICH YOU THINK. BILL I CAN I CAN I I'D BE HAPPY GET BACK TO YOU IN A DAY OR TWO SAYING HOW FAST WE CAN LOOK AT THESE REMAINING HUNDRED FOUR. FIVE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN CLOSE LISTER.
