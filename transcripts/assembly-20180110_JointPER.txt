DARTED I DON'T. SENATOR STILL. IN COMMITTEE SO THAT I WELCOME EVERYBODY THIS MORNING ON THE JOINT HEARING OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE. ON PUBLIC GRIEF. EMPLOYMENT AND RETIREMENT COMMITTEE AND THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT. AND SOCIAL SECURITY. HOUSE CALIFORNIA PENSIONS PUBLIC PENSIONS FUNDS SUPPORT CALIFORNIA VALUES WATCHFUL IN THEIR FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS. TODAY'S HEARING IS A PART CONSIDER IN OUR POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CLIMATE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. IT IS MY GOTO HERE SEVERAL PERSPECTIVE FROM MANY GROUPS TODAY. AS A POLICYMAKER IT IS IMPORTANT FOR ME TO HEAR FROM YOU REGARDING THE IMPLICATIONS OF DIVESTMENT AND INVESTMENT POLICIES WE MUST CONSIDER. HOW THE IMPACT ALL PUBLIC EMPLOYEES AND THE RETIREMENT? AS WELL AS LONG TERM IMPLICATIONS. THAT THESE HAVE ON THE SUSTAINABILITY OF CALPERS AND CAL STIRS. FOR A LEAST A DECADE WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF PROPOSALS CALLING FOR THE SYSTEM TO DIVEST. FROM INVESTMENTS THIS ALSO INCLUDES PROPOSALS THAT ARE THE IDEAS OF CALPERS MCALISTER'S BOARDS. I'M REALLY INTERESTED THIS MORNING IN HEARING AND UNDERSTANDING HOW THESE POLICIES HAVE AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE AFFECTS ON THE LONG TERM FINANCES OF THE SYSTEM. WHILE CONSIDERING THEIR CURRENT FUNDED STATUS AND WHAT THIS COULD MEAN FOR FUTURE RETIREES. GIVEN OUR TIME TODAY I ASK AND REMIND EVERYONE WHO IS SPEAKING TO PLEASE STAY ON TOPIC. THAT SHARON IS NOT ABOUT PENSION REFORM EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION RATES O ABOUT THE COST OF PUBLIC EMPLOYEES VENGEANCE. WE HAVE AMPLE TIME TO DISCUSS THOSE IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT LATER HEARINGS. SO THAT THANK YOU THIS MORNING AND I LOOK HERE AND FOR HEARING FROM YOU ALL THIS MORNING IN WITHOUT ASSEMBLYMEMBER. COOLEY DO YOU HAVE ANY WORD YOU LIKE TO. OKAY SO WITH THAT WE HAVE OUR FIRST PANEL OF. ARE SPARKING CALIFORNIA VALUES WHY INVESTING CALIFORNIA PUBLIC PENSION FUNDS WITH US HERE THIS MORNING AS KRISTIN'S BALDING. CALIFORNIA DIRECTOR OF. SERIES JENNIFER BAKER LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE OF CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. AND JODY NEWMAN INVESTMENT MANAGER TRILLIUM ASSET MANAGEMENT COMFORTABLY. AND WE CAN GO AHEAD WITH WHO WOULD EVER WANT TO GO FIRST. ARE THEY HERE. CHIN JUTTING. OF. GO AHEAD AND. FIRST GO AHEAD. AND MORNING JENNIFER BAKER THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR. PROVIDING US WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE SOME OF THE PERSPECTIVES. ON SOME VERY IMPORTANT TOPICS THAT YOU'VE BEEN DISCUSSING FOR QUITE A NUMBER OF YEARS. DIS DID. THESE TOPICS HAVE BEEN COMING UP MUCH MORE OFTEN AND THE CONVERSATIONS HAVE BECOME MUCH MORE COMPLEX THAN THEY USED TO DO. IT I THINK MOST IMPORTANTLY. THE CONVERSATIONS THAT HAPPENED WITHIN THE WALLS OF CAL STIRS IN CALPERS WHO WE REALIZE DON'T ALWAYS. TRICKLE OVER TO THE CAPITOL CORRIDORS AND SO WHILE YOU MAY NOT HEAR DISCUSSIONS THAT HAPPEN REGARDING ENGAGEMENT OR DIVESTMENT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT CONVERSATIONS ARE NOT TAKING PLACE. WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU IS THAT THAT CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION FULLY SUPPORTS THE WORK THAT CAL STEWARDS DOES IN REGARD TO ENGAGEMENT? AND WE APPRECIATE THAT THOROUGH DIALOGUE THAT THEY'VE HAD WITHIN THEIR INVESTMENT DIVISIONS ON THE CONVERSATIONS HAVE BEEN. VERY DIFFICULT AND VERY COLORFUL BUT WE APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT CALCIUM'S TRIES TO ENGAGE WITH COMPANIES. AND TRIES TO USE THE VALUES THAT THEY HAVE TO SHAPE CHANGE AND SYSTEMIC CHANGES VERY DIFFICULT AND IT'S NOT OVER NIGHT. CAL STIRS ALWAYS LOOKS AT ISSUES OVER A VERY LONG TERM HORIZON WHICH DOES NOT ALWAYS TAKE THE PLATE TAKE PLACE AND OTHER AREAS. THE DIFFICULTY THAT WE HAVE WON'T DURING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT EITHER ENGAGEMENT OR DIVESTMENT IN THE WALLS OF THE CAPITAL IS THAT THERE'S NOT ALWAYS A CONVERSATION ABOUT FUNDING IMPLICATIONS. IT WAS ALWAYS COMPLEX EVEN BEFORE WE HAD AB FOURTEEN SIXTEEN I AM BUT AS YOU KNOW JUST A FEW YEARS AGO THANKS TO YOUR HARD WORK AND DEDICATION THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR PASS AB FOURTEEN SIXTY NINE. TO FULLY FUND CAL STIRS OVER A PERIOD OF THIRTY TWO YEARS. NOW WHEN THERE ARE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT DIVESTMENT SHOULD THERE BE ANY COST IMPLICATIONS NOT ONLY DOES IT HAVE A COST TO THE FUND WILL MORE WORKING ON IN. IMPLEMENTING THE LONG TERM COSTS OF CAL STICKERS BUT THAT ALSO CAN HAVE AN IMPACT ON CONTRIBUTION RATES THAT OUR MEMBERS ARE PAINTED CAL STIRRERS. ULTIMATELY IN THIS IS A VERY COMPLICATED SO I CAN'T FIT INTO THREE MINUTES. BUT WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS ULTIMATELY THAT COULD LEAD TO LONG TERM INCREASES DISPROPORTIONATELY TO OUR NEW S. EDUCATORS THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN HIRED AFTER TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN. SO JUST AS THE LEGISLATURE HAS CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE TEACHER SHORTAGE AND WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP REMEDY THAT. PLEASE KNOW THAT WHEN YOU HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT DIVESTMENT YOU COULD HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF EXACERBATING THE TEACHER SHORTAGE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH SIMULTANEOUSLY. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO TALK ABOUT EMOTIONAL IN FACT BATES ISSUES AT THE SAME TIME NEVER THE LAST THIS IS ONE OF THE IMPORTANT TASK THAT WE ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE WHICH IS WHY WE APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS THAT YOU. AS BOTH OF YOUR RESPECTIVE COMMITTEES AND MANY OF THE LEGISLATORS WHO HAVE INTRODUCED BILLS REGARDING DIVESTMENT OR ENGAGEMENT. OUT WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE BEEN WILLING TO ENGAGE WITH US OF FINDING NEW AND CREATIVE WAYS TO MOVE THESE CONVERSATIONS FORWARD WE PARTICULARLY APPRECIATE THE WORK OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA THIS. PAST YEAR IN SHIFTING THE DIRECTION OF AB TWENTY FROM A DIVESTMENT TO AN ENGAGEMENT BILL AND WE'RE HOPING THAT THIS NEW APPROACH. OF TALKING ABOUT ISSUES MIGHT BE A NEW TOOL THAT BOTH LEGISLATORS AND THEIR STAFF WORKING ON THE ISSUES MIGHT CONSIDER IN ADDITION EVALUATING THE LONG TERM FISCAL CONSEQUENCES THAT THAT COULD HAVE AND ITS IMPLICATIONS ON MEMBERS OF THE FUN AS WELL AS THE GENERAL FUND WHO ALO PAYS FOR. CAL STIRS AS WELL I APPRECIATE THE TIME THAT YOU PROVIDED TO ME AND I'M AVAILABLE FOR ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. GOING. MORNING I CARE STERN SPAULDING AYE. YEAH A LOT IN CALIFORNIA PROGRAM OF THEORIES. THEORIES IS A NONPROFIT AND WE MANAGE THE INVESTOR NETWORK OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS WITH. OVER TWENTY TRILLION IN ASSETS. THIS GROUP OF AN INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS BOTH OWNERS AND MANAGERS COME TOGETHER TO REALLY THINK ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES AND. RISKS CROSS THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS AS THEY THINK ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE ISSUES. WE HAVE FOCUSED ON CLIMATE CHANGE ON WATER MANAGEMENT ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND EQUITY ISSUES. CALPERS AND CAL STORES HAVE BEEN VERY ENGAGED IN OUR NETWORK OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN WITH CERES OVER THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF OUR. SINCE BOTH HAVE HAD POSITIONS ON OUR BOARD AND BOTH THE BAND REAL LEADERS IN THE NORTH AMERICAN NETWORK OF INVESTORS. I WANT TO SPEAK TODAY TO THEIR ROLE IN ENGAGEMENT AS A STRATEGY FOR MANAGING SYSTEMIC RISK. WHEN WE SAY SYSTEMIC RISKS WE'RE TALKING BOUT RISK. SO BIG THAT THEY AFFECT EVERY ASSET CLASS THAT THEY AFFECT EVERY SECTOR OF THE. AND THOSE ARE RISKS LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE AND WATER MANAGEMENT. HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES THAT WILL AFFECT MANY DIFFERENT COMPANIES. THESE KINDS OF SYSTEMIC RISK CANNOT BE DEALT. BY ONE INVESTOR WITH ONE PORTION OF OUR ACCOMPANYING AND THEIR HOLDINGS THEY REALLY HAVE TO BE DEALT WITH COLLABORATIVELY. COLLECTIVELY WE NEED TO HAVE A PLAN TO REALLY IMPACT THE ENTIRE ECONOMY AND CALPERS AND CAL STORES OF BOTH LEAD THAT WORK WITH US. I WANNA GIVE JUST THREE QUICK EXAMPLES NOTHING IS ONE OF THE. MOST IMPORTANT EMISSIONS THAT IS AFFECTING CLIMATE CHANGES TO IT ON GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND CAO STIRS UNDERTOOK A PROGRAM SEVERAL YEARS AGO TO REALLY BEGIN TO ADDRESS METHANE. IN THEIR PORTFOLIO. THEY LED A DIALOGUE WITH THE SERIES OF FOURTEEN COMPANIES ULTIMATELY ON FILING RESOLUTIONS WITH A SMALLER SUBSET OF THOSE WHO WILL NOT RESPOND. THE DIALOGUE AND ULTIMATELY GETTING. FIRM COMMITMENTS FROM THESE BIG OIL AND GAS COMPANIES TO MANAGE THEIR METHANE EMISSIONS DIFFERENTLY. THOSE COMMITMENTS LED TO THE WITHDRAWAL OF RESOLUTIONS THEY DIDN'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO GO TO A VOTE. BUT THAT SIGNAL FOURTEEN BIG COMPANIES LED BY ONE OF THE LARGEST INVESTORS IN THE U. S. IMPACTS THE ENTIRE WORLD. ALL OF THE OIL AND GAS SECTOR TAKES NOTE THAT METHANE EMISSIONS MUST BE MANAGED DIFFERENTLY TO ADDRESS THIS CRITICAL RISK A RISK THAT WILL AFFECT NOT ONLY THOSE COMPANIES. AND THE PORTFOLIOS OF EVERY INVESTOR BUT OBVIOUSLY RISK THAT WILL AFFECT OUR PLANET AS WELL. CALPERS SIMILARLY UNDERTOOK A. OF REAL LEADERSHIP ROLE WITH EXXON MOBIL LAST YEAR EXXON MOBIL AND WE DEMANDED A TWO DEGREE SCENARIO ANALYSIS. WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THIS COMPANY IF WE MANAGE TO KEEP GLOBAL WARMING UNDER? TWO DEGREES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PARIS AGREEMENT. CALPERS SAID WE WANT TO SEE YOUR ANALYSIS UP UNTIL THAT POINT EXXON HAD BEEN SAYING WE DON'T THINK WE NEED TO DO ANY ANALYSIS BECAUSE THAT'S NOT IN THE RANGE OF POSSIBILITIES. THEY WERE REFUSING TO CONSIDER WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN THE LONG RUN IF THAT IF THAT REALITY BECAME TRUE. AND FINALLY CALPERS FILED THE RESOLUTION LED THE PROXY SOLICITATION AND SIXTY TWO PERCENT OF THE SHARE OWNERS VOTED FOR IT REQUIRING EXTOLLING. TO DO THAT ANALYSIS WITHOUT ANALYSIS NOW THERE'S TRANSPARENCY AND THE MEAN FESTERS LIKE CALPERS AND CAL STIRS CAN EVALUATE THE REST. TO THEIR PORTFOLIO AGAIN SENDING A SIGNAL TO OTHERS IN THE SECTOR AROUND THE WORLD TO OTHER INVESTORS BUT GIVING US CRITICAL INFORMATION FOR ACTIVELY MANAGING OUR PORTFOLIO IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR FIDUCIARY DUTY. THAT'S THE SECOND EXAMPLE IN THE THIRTY EXAMPLE CALPERS HAS. RECENTLY STARTED AN INITIATIVE WITH SIRIUS AND OTHER INVESTOR NETWORKS AROUND THE WORLD A EUROPEAN NETWORK STRAND HIS NETWORK. AND THEN ASIAN THAT WORK TOGETHER ON ADDRESSING ENGAGING. THE HUNDRED HEAVIEST DEMENTORS IN THE CALPERS AND OTHER PORTFOLIOS FOR YOU KNOW UNIVERSAL INVESTORS MANY OF THESE HEAVIER MEMBERS. GREENHOUSE GAS EMITTERS ARE THE SAME. SO WE HAVE DECIDED TO WORK WITH THESE HUNDRED COMPANIES TO BEGIN TO ADDRESS THEIR MISSION ASKING FOR TRANSPARENCY ASKING FOR MANAGEMENT PLANS TO DEGREE SCENARIO ANALYSIS AND ULTIMATELY GETTING TO SCIENCE BASE OR GETS. TO A REDUCE THE EMISSIONS. THAT PLAN WE WE BELIEVE WILL AFFECT ALL OF THESE COMPANIES AROUND THE WORLD IT WILL CERTAINLY CHANGE THE WAY INVESTORS ARE ABLE TO EVALUATE THESE RISKS. AND AGAIN REMEMBERING THAT THESE RISKS ARE SYSTEMIC WHAT HAPPENS IN THE OIL AND GAS SECTOR WILL HAVE A RIPPLE EFFECT VERSIONS SO MANY OTHER SECTORS OF THE. SO THIS IS FOR FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE A VERY EFFECTIVE IF THE HOUSE. OF ALSO ON THE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE IN THAT HEARING WAS CONTINUING R. OR THE QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF OUR PANELISTS. WELL I'M ACTUALLY BEFORE YOU EGO AYE. ARM SO IT IN TERMS YOU KNOW I THINK WE. ONE OF THE REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUES. FOR ME IS WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS A AT THE. BUT IT'S THE BEST ENGAGEMENT O FORCES US TO RECOGNIZE THAT. NO OUR PENSION FUNDS ARE. REALLY HELD IN TRUST FOR. OUR THAT THAT THE RETIREES RIGHT. WE'VE MADE OUR. LOCAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES SCHOOL THIS YEAR MADE PROMISES. THAT WE NEED TO KEEP AND. AND IN FACT. DAY MAY HAVE GIVEN UP THINGS AT THE BARGAINING TABLE IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THEIR PENSIONS SO. ULTIMATELY. THESE THEIR YOU KNOW FUNDS WHAT WE WILL CERTAINLY. AND IT'S IMPORTANT THEIR LOOK LINE OF THEIR VALUES BUT. ALSO WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THEY ARE HELD IN THAT TRUSTS FOR ARE. FOR WERE OUR RETIREES BILLS CURRENT ANY AND AND AND FUTURE RETIREES BASED ON THOSE FOR THOSE PROMISES. WAS. TERMS OF FIVE AND. WELL YOUR DO YOU REPRESENT AN ORGANIZATION THAT HAD THAT AS A FUTURE RETIREES AS WELL. IDIOTS IN TERMS OF. LOOKING AT. YES WERE TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD. HOUSE OUT BECAUSE AND I APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONIES ARE HOW DO YOU THINK IN TERMS OF. WE GOT STIRS AND PURRS PURRS EVEN LARGER RIGHT ANA HOW LARGE PSYLLIUM IS BUT IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE THAT THOSE BUT THOSE FUNDS. THAT. THIRD OF BALANCE BETWEEN SAYING WELL YOU BECAUSE YOU MADE REFERENCE TO YOUNG DIVESTMENT IS BEING ONE WAY TO PUT SOME PRESSURE BUT ALSO ENGAGEMENT. YEAH THAT IF YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY A STE. SHAREOWNER. YOU HEAR IT OUT OF YOUR ABILITY TO ACTUALLY ENGAGE THEREFORE DIMINISHES AS WELL I MEAN CERTAINLY YOU SENT A SIGNAL BY SAYING WE'RE JUST HOPE OUR MONEY THERE BUT. MAYBE WE CAN PERHAPS. R. MIGHT TOUCH ON THAT. THAT WE. ILLEGAL. THEY'LL FIND. AND HIS RIGHT. HOMEOWNERSHIP. IBM. PUBLISHED BECAUSE YOU ARE. WAY. BUT THAT'S WAY HIGH ALSO. HOMES BROWN. IF NEW EVENYOU SAY OKAY OUR ATHLETES. ALL BETTER TIME. BUT YOU DON'T KNOW. OKAY MAKING FUNNY BUT WE MONITOR PASSED. I HARDLY THINK. MOBILE AS PART OF THE WHOLE THING. ALLEVIATE ONE ASPECT THAT HAS NOT BEEN CONTINUOUSLY CONSIDERED IS EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PREVIOUS PROPOSALS SOME DIVESTMENT MEASURES. FOR EXAMPLE SUDAN YOU NO LONGER HAVE ONE SUDAN ANYMORE BUT YET THERE HASN'T BEEN A MECHANISM TO REEVALUATE SHOULD THAT BE CHANGE SHOULD BE ELIMINATED ACCEPT IRA SO. IF YOU HAVE A POLICY MECHANISM WHERE YOU'RE LOOKING AT DID YOU TO ACHIEVE THE POLICY GOAL THAT YOU SET OUT TO ACHIEVE. IN ADITION WHERE THERE ANY FISCAL IMPACTS OF THAT AND WHO IS PAYING THE PRICE SO IF YOU'RE ABLE TO LOOK AT THAT FROM A LONGER TERM PERSPECTIVE FROM AS A BODY THAT MIGHT HELP. THIS INSTITUTION TO FIND A WAY THAT MIGHT BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE IN HAVING NOT CONVERSATION PROVIDED THAT. THE FIRST STEP IS ENGAGEMENT AND THAT YOU'VE SUCCESSFULLY I USE ALL THE TOOLS THAT YOU HAVE IN THAT TOOL BOX AND THEN EVALUATE IF YOU ARE GOING TO TO PULL THAT TRIGGER WHO'S GOING TO PY THE COST IN IS THERE AGREEMENT THAT THAT'S THE APPROPRIATE PLACE TO PLAY DOT. COSTS THE DILEMMA THAT WE HAVE IS THAT YOU USED TO HAVE. DIVESTMENT ISSUES SPORADICALLY DISCUSSED THAT IS NOT THE CASE ANYMORE WHICH IS ABOUT CREATING A BIT MORE PRESSURE SO IF THERE IS A WAY THAT THIS BODY CAN PULL ALL OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS INTO ONE'S SO INSTEAD OF HAVING NUMEROUS BILLS INTRODUCED REGARDING DIVESTMENT. IF THAT IS GOING TO BE THE TREND IS THERE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO SAY LET'S EVALUATE ALL OF THESE RANK ALL OF THESE AND ALSO ASSESS THE CUMULATIVE COST. AND THEN DECIDE WHICH DIRECTION YOU WANT TO GO IN THAT MIGHT AT LEAST HELP THIS BODY TO FIND A MORE EFFECTIVE WAY TO HAVE A MACRO DISCUSSION ON WHAT IT IS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE. I WOULD JUST ADD THAT THOUGH I THINK OUR MEMBERS REALLY THINK ABOUT DIVESTMENT FROM A RISK AND OFFER TO. SO AS I DESCRIBED R. ENGAGEMENTS ARE OFTEN REALLY FOCUSED ON GETTING MORE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW RISKY. THE BEHAVIOR OF THIS COMPANY IS IN A MATERIAL WAY IN A WAY I THINK IMPACT THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY. AND THE VALUE OF OUR LONG TERM HOLDINGS FOR THE PENSIONS. IF YOU THINK FROM THAT RISK PERSPECTIVE THEN IT FELL OVER TIME OUR ENGAGEMENTS LEAD US TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THESE COMPANIES FOR EXAMPLE THE OIL AND GAS COMPANIES. REALLY ARE NOT MOVING IN THE WAY THE WHOLE ECONOMY IS MOVING THEY'RE GOING TO BE STRANDED ASSETS THEY'RE GOING TO BE LEFT BEHIND. SOME COMPANIES ARE MUCH WORSE THAN OTHERS WE MAY WANNA UNDERWEIGHT. AND SO RATHER THAN SAYING A BLANKET DIVESTMENT WE MAY SAY WELL THESE ARE JUST TOO RISKY FOR THE PORTFOLIO WE REDUCE OUR HOLDINGS IN THESE. WE OP OUR HOLDINGS IN OPPORTUNITIES AS JODY DESCRIBED LOOKING FOR COMPANIES THAT ARE REALLY GOING TO PRODUCE VALUE IN THE LONG RUN AND THAT'S. THAT'S THE WAY MANY OF OUR MEMBERS TALK ABOUT THIS THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT A ONE TIME GET OUT AND STAY OUT. BUT RATHER REALLY THINKING ABOUT RISK MANAGEMENT ACROSS THE PORTFOLIO A FROSTED. YES THAT IS AMERICAN DOWN I I HAVE A QUESTION MAYBE IT'S BEEN ASKED IN A DIFFERENT MANNER AND MAYBE IT'S NOT FOR THIS PANEL MAYBE IT'S FOR SUBSEQUENT PANEL MAYBE IT'S ARGUMENT ANSWER. BUT JOE YOU COME FROM A CONCORD SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE FUND. IS THAT CORRECT. SO WHAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS WHAT'S THE COST OF GOING THAT DIRECTION. FIRST A FUND THAT REALLY DOESN'T LABEL ITSELF. SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE WHAT'S THE IMPACT. S. STIRS AND PURRS INDIVIDUALLY ON THAT HAS THERE BEEN ANY IN MAYBE MAYBE THIS FOR ANOTHER PANEL MAYBE THIS CHANCE QUESTION CAN'T BE ANSWERED TODAY. BUT HAS THERE BEEN A REPORT PRODUCES SHOWS. WHERE WOULD WE BE HAD WE NOT GONE THIS DIRECTION VERSUS? THAT'S ACTUALLY BEEN ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT. THAT WE'VE ASKED. THAT'S THE QUESTION THAT ARE IN IN ILLINOIS IS HAS BEEN ANSWERED OF IT IT IS YOU KNOW MAYBE I JUST. CERTAINLY THAT'S SOMETHING THE BOARDS OF SISTERS AND PURRS HAVE LOOKED AT. AND. SO IN THEIR DISCUSSIONS THEY'VE ASKED ME. SO IN I THINK THERE'S ARE SOME ANALYSES AVAILABLE WE WILL WE WILL HAVE THE INVEST THE THE DIRECT THE THE DCS AND AND AND AND AND ADDRESS IMPRESSIONS FROM FROM BOTH FUNDS. IN THE FUTURE ENOUGH PANEL LATER ON SO I THINK YOU MIGHT YOU COULD ASK THEM THAT. AS WELL IT THEY MAY ACTUALLY HAVE MORE SPECIFIC NUMBERS AND OTHER THEY MAY BE NODDING THEIR HEADS RIGHT. THOUGHT PAT ARE NOT I DON'T KNOW THAT ONLY BLACK BUT CERTAINLY THERE'S BEEN SOME WORK DONE IN THAT AREA IS IS REALLY THAT'S. WHAT WILL WANT TO KNOW? WHAT I WANNA? YOU A MORE. FOCUSES COST. THAT IF YOU'RE INVESTING ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL GOVERNANCE. MATTER AND IF YOU'RE. THANK YOU MY TAKING IT TO RISK ADJUSTED PERFORMANCE. LIKE I THINK THERE'S AN AREA THAT NEARLY OUT OF STUDIES OUT THERE THAT HAVE PROVEN THAT THAT'S NOT THE CASE. BUT THE OTHER IDEA OF COST IS THE COST OF ACTUALLY THEIR VESTING THE FUNDS AND THE PROCESS OF DOING MATH AND ROLLING INTO MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE. INVESTMENT AND THE IDEA THERE IS THAT THERE ARE TYPICAL REBALANCING SESSIONS TO FUNDS THAT ARE MANAGED SO THERE WOULD BE A MORE NATURAL WAYS OVER A PERIOD OF THREE TO FIVE YEARS. TO DIVEST FROM CERTAIN POOR PERFORMERS AND INVESTING GOOD PERFORMANCE. AND WITH THE AVAILABILITY OF ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF WAYS TO MANAGE IN A SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE MANNER NOW THERE'S TONS OF. MASSIVE PRODUCTS OUT THERE THERE'S A LOT ACTIVE PRODUCTS THERE'S A LOT OF WAYS TO MANAGE IT BUT IN TYPICAL REBALANCING. THE COSTS OF SWITCHING THAT PORTFOLIO SHOULD BE FAIRLY. BUT BUT STILL THAT THE LONG TERM INVESTMENT IS MY QUESTION IN AND THAT'S ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH AYE CAL STIRS ON FOR QUITE A NUMBER OF YEARS AND WE'VE BEEN ASKING FOR FOR EXAMPLE. A GIVEN ALL THE CURRENT DIVESTMENT DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE NOW THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS WE'VE ASKED CAN YOU PUT TOGETHER IF THESE DISCUSSIONS HAD. TAKEN PLACE A DECADE AGO AND YOU WERE TOLD TO DIVEST WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE COST IMPLICATION WHAT WOULD THE RATE OF RETURN HAVE BEEN BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY. IF DIVESTMENT AND X. Y. OR Z. MEANS THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE A SEVEN PERCENT RATE OF RETURN THAT DOES HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE CONTRIBUTION RATES THAT EMPLOYERS ARE PAIN. THAT ARE NOT ONLY OUR MEMBERS BUT PARTICULARLY NEW MEMBERS THAT WERE HIRED AFTER TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN OUR PAIN AND THEN ULTIMATELY IN ADDITION BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITIES OF AB FOURTEEN SIXTY NINE. THE GENERAL FUND ALSO PAYS FOR THAT SO IN A SENSE YOU'RE TAXING EDUCATORS IN YOUR TAX IN THE STATE TO MAKE THAT DECISION WHICH IS WHY WE'VE ENCOURAGE A FISCAL DISCUSSION. SO THAT THERE'S A TRUE UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE THOSE COSTS MAY BE OUT WHICH IS WHY WE WOULD ENCOURAGE ANYTIME YOU'RE HAVING A DISCUSSION ABOUT DIVESTMENT. TO ENSURE THAT YOU'RE ASKING IF THERE WERE TO BE LOSSES WHO WOULD COVER THOSE LOSSES IS GOING TO HELPED US HAVE A BETTER SENSE IN IT MAY NOT EVEN BE. A MEDIA BUT TO ENSURE THAT YOUR CHECKING WITH THE INVESTMENT DIVISIONS OF COUNSELORS AND CALPERS AS THOSE DISCUSSIONS ARE HAPPENING TO KNOW WHAT THE ULTIMATE CONTRIBUTION RATE IMPACT WHICH SHOULD BE THE STATE BUDGET. WELL WE HAVE WE HAVE ARGUED FOR US WOULD YOU GO YOUR YOU CAN'T WE HAVE ARGUED ARE PER OUR PERSPECTIVE FOR THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION IS. WE WOULDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH DIVESTMENT DOES IF THE LEGISLATURE WOULD INDEMNIFY THE FUNDS. BUT DOT CONVERSATION HASN'T HAS NOT ALWAYS MOVED THE DIRECTION THAT WE WOULD LIKE. BUT IF THE IF THERE IS A REALIZATION THAT THERE'S A COSTS AND. AND THE GENERAL FUND WOULD PICK IT UP THAT'S A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION BUT SOME OF THESE COSTS ARE EXTREMELY LARGE WELL I HOPE AS WE AS WE MAY SEE MORE THESE BILLS WILL SEE. THIS YEAR THAT THAT CONVERSATION IS HEAD OF THE TABLE AT THE AT THE HEARING LEVEL. IN EVEN EVEN ON THE BUDGET SIDE AS TO HOW. THESE YOU KNOW THESE BILLS ARE GOING TO BE PAID FOR THE STATUTES ARE GOING TO BE PAID FOR. THANK YOU. BUT COOLEY. I'M OR JUST WANT TO COMMENT ON THE GENERAL TOPIC A LITTLE BIT. I THINK THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT HEARING I'M VERY APPRECIATIVE OF OPENING THIS SUBJECT MATTER. ARM. BUT INTELLECTUALLY I FEEL IT'S IT'S JUST A START. YOU KNOW THE PICTURE COMES TO MIND TO ME IS YOU KNOW. YOU'RE WEARING THAT SWEATER AND HASN'T LOSE LOSE. BETTER. THREAT ON NEW GRABBED IT JUST KEEPS COMING. I THINK THIS IS A PART OF MUCH LARGER WHOLE. ARE VOTERS A COURSE IN JUNE OF NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR ADOPTED PROPOSITION TWENTY ONE BY FIFTY THREE PERCENT THE VOTE. IMPOSING AN EXCLUSIVE AND SOUL FIDUCIARY DUTY ON PENSION SYSTEMS. COULD MINISTER THE FUNDS. FOR THE BENEFICIARIES. SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE. THEIR JOB. SCREW SIMPLY SOLELY I THINK WE NEED TO RECKON WITH THAT FACT IN OUR STATE CONSTITUTION. I WON A POINT OUT THE TO PRODUCE JURY DUTY IS ABOUT PRUDENCE. AND IN THAT NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR BALLOT PROPOSITION IT WAS NOT SIMPLY THE CRUDENESS OF ORDINARY INVESTOR. WAS APPROVED SEVEN INVESTOR FAMILIAR WITH THESE MATTERS WHICH IS ACTUALLY COULDN'T. EXPERT STANDARD. SO ON THEIR BACKS. IS THE PRUDENT EXPERTS STANDARD AS TO HOW THEY ADMINISTER THESE FUNDS. I THINK WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE WORLD HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR. S. ESCALATES THE COMPLEXITY OF THIS PAST. THE NATURE OF SYSTEMIC RISK IN THE ECONOMY THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. ARE. THE RISE THANK YOU TROLLING FOR BEING PRESENT YOUR SORT OF THE THE MARKER FOR THIS PIECE THE CONVERSATION. A GREAT RISE IN SPECIALIZED SERVICE PROVIDERS TO BRING. BRING SKILL SETS THAT THEY WISH TO MARKET A PENSION FUNDS TO ASSIST THEM. PENSION FUNDS IN THEIR WORK BUT NONE THE LESS IT IS THE JOB OF THE PENSION FUNDS. TO EXERCISE OWN DISCRETION IN THE WHO ARE THE EXPERTS SAY HIGHER. AND COURSE THE GREAT RULE OF EXPERTS IS EXPERTS SHOULD BE ON TAP BUT NEVER ON TOP. SO ONCEAGAIN WE'RE LEFT WITH THE PENSION SYSTEMS AS HE SOLIS WHO SERVED RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. AND THEN MORE GLOBALLY. DRAMATIC DRAMATIC INCREASES THE COMPLEXITY INVESTMENT ENVIRONMENT. CONFRONTING THESE ENTERPRISES GLOBALLY IN OUR INVESTMENT PROTOCOL. SO HONESTLY I THINK IS THE LEGISLATURE THIS WHERE MY THREAD STARTS COMING UNDONE. IF WE'RE ASK OURSELVES WHAT IS THE RESPONSE ALLEGED TO SUPPORT PENSION SYSTEMS. CALPERS CALPERS THE COUNTY SYSTEMS OTHERS AROUND THE COUNTRY. IT OUGHTA BE MAKING SURE THAT THE. CALPERS CAL STIRS OUR FREED UP TO INVESTED INTELLECTUAL LABOR THAT IS REQUIRED. TOO MAKE SURE THEY'RE INVESTMENT STRATEGIES ARE WELL ADAPTED. THE GLOBAL INVESTMENT ENVIRONMENT. SO I PERSONALLY FEEL THAT THE THIS APPEAL THAT WE WE. TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT SOME OF THESE ONES THAT WANNA. YOU KNOW HE JUST QUIT. POOR FOLLOW THIS WAY TRIGGERED THIS WINTER FOR SOME PURPOSE. THOSE ARE NOT JUST BILLS ENUNCIATED POLICY THOSE ARE BILLS INVITED AN OPPORTUNITY COST ON THE PENSION FUNDS TO DIVERT THEIR INTELLECTUAL ASSETS. FROM THESE GLOBAL THINGS INTO VITAL FOR THEM TO ADDRESS IS A PART OF THEIR FUTURE RESPONSIBILITY. ARE. AND AND TO GET DOWN THE WEEDS OF OR SMALLER THINGS WHICH A RESPONSIBILITY OF IN FARM. WHEN I ACTUALLY THINK THE GAME IS ELSEWHERE EVER PENSION FUNDS ARE GONNA BE WELL ADMINISTERED. AND. AS I SAY YOU KNOW THIS. COULDN'T STUDIO WHICH IS A PART OF THE DUTY OF A FIDUCIARY DUTY WHICH IS THE CONSTITUTIONAL STANDARD. THE FIDUCIARY DUTY ALSO INCLUDES THE DUTY OF LOYALTY. WHICH MEANS YOU WILL NOT GET YOURSELF DIVERTED FROM FOCUSING ON THE BEEN FISHERIES. AND THAT OUGHT TO BE HAD MONITORING THE LEGISLATURE THAT THEY HAVE A DUTY OF LOYALTY. ALSO IMPARTIALITY. THAT THEY SHOULD CONDUCT THEIR WORK AS A FIDUCIARY IMPARTIAL. FOCUSED ON THE RESULT WHICH THEY ARE CHARGED WITH. AND I JUST FEEL THAT THE. THIS IS A VERY CRITICAL TIME FOR. ARE PENSION SYSTEMS. IT IS A CRITICAL TIME FOR THE ACTUAL QUESTION HOW DO WE GIVE THOUGHT LEADERSHIP ON HOW TO. OPERATE IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. EXTREMELY CRITICAL. AND NOT JUST FOR THE BOTTOM LINE OF THESE PENSION FUNDS FOR OUR TAXPAYERS. BUT YOU KNOW I'M ALWAYS REMINDED THAT IN THE. IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES WHEN I WAS ACTUALLY SENT THE WHARTON SCHOOL OF BUSINESS BY THE STATE ASSEMBLY ON POTENTIAL INVESTMENT WORK. YOU KNOW FIFTIES SIXTIES MOST AMERICAN WORKERS WERE COVERED AS YOU KNOW BY PENSION FUNDS. WE THEN HAD A RESEARCH ADOPTED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR. THE DUTY OF LOYALTY OF PENSION FUNDS BECAUSE A RECIPIENT OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR PENSIONS. AND THE DUTY OF LOYALTY FOR PRIVATE PENSION ADMINISTRATORS. WAS EXPRESSED IN A. I FORGET THE DATE I'LL COME UP WITH THAT A NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT ADVISORY LETTER FOR THE US DEPARTMENT LET LABOR THE AVON LETTER. WHICH TOLD PRIVATE PENSION SYSTEMS. THAT THEY COULD NOT RESPOND IN THEIR INVESTMENT STRATEGY. TO THE PROTOCOLS REQUESTED BY THE GOVERNING BOARD A CORPORATION. BECAUSE OUR DUTY OF LOYALTY WAS TO THEIR PEOPLE. WE JUST WE JUST DID A KIND OF FOCUS ON HOW WE SUPPORT. PENSION FUNDS. WELL EQUIPPED TO DEAL THE MODERN INVESTMENT ENVIRONMENT. BECAUSE FRANKLY IN THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN IS THE PENSION FUND WHICH IS THE FLY WILL HELP CISCO FAR AWAY BACK. THE EXISTENCE OF SECURITAS HOMELESS PEOPLE LADEN THEIR CAREERS RETIRAR. RETIRE IF THEY WISH. TO OPEN UP ENTRY LEVEL POSITIONS FOR NEW COLLEGE GRADUATES. AND OF THOSE PEOPLE IN RETIREMENT WHO HAVE PENSION SECURE PROJECT AND SPEND MONEY AND SUPPORT OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY. SO THEY ARE UNIQUE FLY WE. AND I THINK THIS CONVERSATION'S HOW DO WE PERPETUATE THAT FI WILL. OPERATE IN IN OUR ECONOMY EVEN A DOWNTURN. FOR A LONG TIME SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH SHELVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU HUBS. SO THEY KNOW THE QUESTIONS AND I THINK VERY MUCH THANK THE SAP PANEL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS. JUST BELOW HOUSEKEEPING BEFORE WE MOVE ON AND I KNOW I'M. SIGNIFICANTLY TO BLAME. BUT WE DO HAVE TO FINISH UP BY NOON. IN THIS ROOM BECAUSE ANOTHER COMMITTEE IT'S HAVING A HEARING AND WE ARE FOLLOWING A QUITE A BIT BEHIND. SO. ALTHOUGH IT'S PROBABLY MORE OUR FAULT APPEAR THEN THE PRESENTERS. ASK PEOPLE TO BE CONCISE AND I THINK ACTUALLY THE MORE CHANCE WE HAVE FOR DIALOGUE I THINK. THE WE'RE GOING TO PROBABLY GET. MORE OUT OF THE HEARING AS WELL SO I'M HOPING THAT. MAKE THAT HAPPEN AS WELL SO. YEAH I THINK WHETHER THINGS THAT. BELLSOUTH DEPRECIATE IS IS THAT I HEARD LOVE THE STRATEGIES WERE. FAIRLY NEW ONCE I SEE THAT PERHAPS BEING PURSUED BY THAT BOARDS AND THAT AND THAT AND THE PEOPLE ADMINISTERED RESPECTED PENSION FUNDS WHAT HAPPENS HERE IS THAT WE HAVE SOMEONE YOU KNOW WE HAVE STAKEHOLDERS TO WRITE A BILL AND THEN. IF SO THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT ENGAGEMENT HAS R. HAPPENED YET ARE THAT DID NOT WRITING BILL SAYING LET'S ENGAGE IN A DON'T ENGAGE THAT WILL THREATEN TO THE VAST THEN WILL THREATEN TO THE IS OF OURS IS LIKE JUST GOING PLEASE THEY BEST. SO THAT'S FUN THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH HERE AND. SO THEY APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUES YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW HOW DO WE BETTER TREAT PROCESSES THAT. ABSENT THAT KEEPS R. IT KEEPS US IN MIND AND THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT WHAT WHAT YOU KNOW. THE RESPONSIBILITIES WE HAVE IN TERMS OF. OVERSEEN THE PENSION FUNDS AND THAT'S WHY. I CHAIR RODRIGUEZ AND I FELT THAT THIS HEARING WAS SO IMPORTANT TO HAVE SO WITH THAT LET'S GO WE GO AHEAD BRING UP. R. NEXT PRESENTER. BUT HEALTHY CALIFORNIA ACTUAL ADVISORY PANEL. I KNOW WE. GIVE YOU A BIT MORE TIME IN WHICH SO I TO FOR THAT TO YOU SIDE AGAIN. CAN HELP US AT THE TIME APPRECIATED AND DESK EARLIER WORDS OF A VERY IMPORTANT VALUABLE TO US NO NO PROBLEM THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M GONNA APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE I'M GETTING THEM AT THE END OF THE COLD. FOR I'M HOPING YOU ALL CAN NOW HEAR ME JUST FINE CHAIRMAN PAN CHAIRMAN NOT RODRIGUEZ. MY PLEASURE AND MY HONOR TO DE TO SPEAK TO YOU AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THAT COMMITTEE. I'M GOING TO BAB BUT BE RELATIVELY QUICK IN GOING THROUGH THE INFORMATION THAT I HAVE I I CERTAINLY WOULD ENCOURAGE SHOULD. QUESTIONS AS AS WE GO I'M REALLY GONNA TALK ABOUT FIVE THINGS RELATIVELY QUICKLY A VERY BRIEF HISTORY OF THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL ADVISORY PANEL. WILL TALK ABOUT THE REASON I'M HERE WHICH IS GOVERNMENT CODE THAT SECTION. TWENTY TWO TWO NINE WILL TALK ABOUT THE MAIN VALUATION RESULTS PROVIDED BY CALPERS THE ROLE OF THE INVESTMENT RETURN AND THEN THE RULE OF THE GUY IMMUNIZATION AREA. SO FIVE THOUGHT CALIFORNIA ACTUAR LIVE FIVE THREE PANEL WAS ESTABLISHED BY SB ELEVEN TWENTY THREE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT. AND DOW WERE HOUSED IN THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE OB HISTORICALLY WE HAVE. GUN AYE SEVERAL THINGS BUT MOST NOTABLY FOR THINGS. THE. WE PREPARED A MODEL DISCLOSURE ELEMENTS FOR ACTUARIAL VALUATIONS WE'VE PREPARED. BY ACTUARIAL FUNDING POLICIES AND PRACTICES FOR BENEFIT CHANGES WE PREPARED. A DOCUMENT AYE HELPING OUR PUBLIC AGENCIES ABOUT YOUR WEIGHT. PUBLIC SECTOR ACTUARIAL SERVICES AND ARGUABLY MOST NOTABLY WE PREPARED A DOCUMENT THAT HAS ACTUALLY BEEN USED AROUND THE COUNTRY AS I DIED FOR. ACTUARIAL FUNDING POLICIES AND AND PRACTICES FOR PUBLIC PENSION AND AND OPAP. THE. THIS PARTICULAR YEAR WE. TOP PROVIDED RESPONSES TO THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE. ON QUESTIONS RELATIVE TO THEIR HIGH COMPENSATION DATABASE I FAMILY REPITE UP PREPARED RESPONSES TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ARE RELATIVE TO SB EIGHTY FOUR. AND THEN ANNUAL PAP FOR. COMPENSATION LIMIT LADDER. GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION TWENTY TWO TWO NINE. THAT REQUIRES THAT A CALPERS BOARD TO PREPARE A REPORT WITH SOME SPECIFIC INFORMATION IN IT. OUGHT THAT REQUIREMENT WAS MET WITH THE PUBLIC PUBLICATION OF THE JUNE THIRTY TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN VALUATION REPORT I PUT UP. A LINK IN THE HANDOUT TO DO THAT REPORT I'M NOT. NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH ALL HUNDRED AND WHATEVER IT IS THIRTY FIVE PAGES OF OF THAT REPORT. AND BUT IT ALSO REQUIRES THAT CALIFORNIA ACTUARIAL ADVISORY PANEL CHAIR OR DESIGNEES FIVE I'M THE DESIGNEES. ARE. BAD TO Y. PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THE. JOINT HEARING A EXPLAINING THE ROLE OF THE INVEST RETURN IN THE VALUATION DESCRIBING THE CONSEQUENCES OF FUTURES TO FUTURE STATE BUDGETS IF THE INVEST FOR ATTORNEYS NOT THAT. AND REPORTING WHETHER OR NOT THE BOARDS IMMUNIZATION PERIOD EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED AVERAGE REMAINING SERVICE PEER YOU HAD. FOR THE FOR THE MEMBERS. FOR ALL ALL PLANS COMBINED. HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS. THE OFF. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH I APPRECIATE BOTH. BOB. THE JOB MARKET VALUE OF ASSETS A HUNDRED ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS FOR A NET UNFUNDED LIABILITY OF FIVE FIFTY NINE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS. THE PLAN IS SIXTY FIVE PERCENT FUNDED CALPERS IN THE REPORT PROJECTED THE UNFUNDED ARE EXCUSE ME THE FUNDED RATIO USING A SEVEN PERCENT DISCOUNT RATE. TO BE SIXTY FIVE PERCENT AT JUNE THIRTIETH SEVENTEEN AND THEN. THE JOB I CONTRIBUTION RATES VARY BASED ON PLAN THE COMBINED. CONTRIBUTION RATE AS A PERCENTAGE OF PENSIONABLE WAGES IS THIRTY POINT FIXING TO SAY THAT AMOUNT ACTUALLY VARIES QUITE A BIT. FROM. ONE ONE PLAN TO THE NEXT. THE GUIDE CHANGES FROM PRIOR VALUATION AND IN. DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN THE CALPERS BOARD. DECIDED TO REDUCE THE DISCOUNT RATE FROM SEVEN A HALF DOWN TO SEVEN AND THEY'RE REALLY DOING IT INCREMENTALLY WITH THE IMPACT OF EACH OF THOSE CHANGES THINGS STAND OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD SOME FOR EXAMPLE. THE JUNE THIRTY SIXTEEN REPORT USED TO SEVEN AND THREE EIGHTHS DISCOUNT RIGHT. INITIAL IMPACT AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FULL IMPACT ONE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FISCAL YEAR. AND THEN IT JUNE THIRTY EIGHTEEN THEY WILL GET TO A SEVEN PERCENT DISCOUNT RATE I'M INITIALLY IMPACTING NINETEEN TWENTY FULL IMPACT TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. FISCAL YEAR I SAW THE ROLE PLAYED BY THE INVESTMENT RETURN I'M GOING TO APOLOGIZE I'M TRYING TO TALK AS QUICKLY AS I CAN HERE. THAT SAID I'M AT LET'S YOU KNOW IF EVERYBODY SHOULD UNDERSTAND. I ASSETS TO PAY BENEFITS COME FROM TWO SOURCES AND THOSE TWO SOURCES ARE CONTRIBUTIONS INTO THAT SYSTEM INTO THE PLAN. AND INVEST FOR RETURN ON THE INVESTMENT STUTTERING THAT ARE THERE ARE THERE IS NO THIRD EDITION ALL FLOORS. SO I'M WHEN ACTUAR A SIGNAL LOOK AT WHAT THE ARM GOT AVAILABLE ASSETS ARE GOING TO BE WHAT THEY DO IS USE AN ASSUMPTION FOR WHAT FUTURE INVEST FOR RETURN IS GOING TO BE THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE. I JUST TALKED ABOUT CALPERS IS IS ASSUMING DROPPING TO THAT SEVEN PERCENT ASSUMPTION BUT EVERYBODY. EVERYBODY SHOULD UNDERSTAND. IF INVESTMENT RETURN IS HIGHER THAN EXPECTED THAT MEANS CONTRIBUTION CAN BE LOWER ON THE OTHER HAND IF INVESTMENTS ARE LOWER THAN EXPECTED. THAT MEANS CONTRIUTIONS HALF TO BE HIRED SINCE. PART OF THAT ARGUABLY. ZERO ZERO SUM GAME HERE. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND WE TALK ABOUT AN ACTUARIAL LIABILITY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THE PORTION OF THE BENEFITS EXPECTED TO BE PAID FROM CASH SO. IT ARGUABLY WOULD NOT INCLUDE. AYE ANTICIPATED INVESTMENT RETURN. THERE IS IN THE REPORT OP PROVIDED BY CALPERS AYE SEVERAL PAGES ON MY MY. MY MY OPINION I DON'T WORK AT CALPERS CERTAINLY MY OPINION IS THAT SECTION OF THE REPORT IS QUITE WELL DONE EYES ON PAGES THIRTY SIX TO FIFTY I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU ALL TO LIVE. I TAKE A MINUTE AND AND TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. THE. GOAL OF ANY RETIREMENT SYSTEM ARGUABLY SHOULD BE TO MOVE TO A HUNDRED PERCENT FUNDING. AND BOB THE THE WAY IT WORKS IS THE AMORTIZATION PERIOD IS THE TIME ANTICIPATED TO GET TO THAT HUNDRED PERCENT FUNDING. ARM AND AND. THE SHORTER THAT THE SHORT OF THE IMMUNIZATION PERIOD THE HIGHER THE CONTRIBUTION RATES THE LOWER THE INTEREST THAT THAT WOULD BE PAID WHAT THAT REALLY IS DOING IS SET MEANS. CURRENT TAXPAYERS ARE PAYING FOR THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY THE LONGER THE AMORTIZATION PERIOD. MORE INTEREST IS PAID AND CURRENT AND FUTURE TAXPAYERS ARE PAYING FOR MORE OF THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY FATHER IF THIS. THAT THE RED STATES BOB PUSH AND PULL IF YOU WILL AS TO WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT UNFUNDED LIABILITY WILLIE IMMUNIZATION PERIOD. REALLY DRIVES THAT IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE VERY LAST SLIDE YOU SEE THE. BOB EVERY GENERALIZATION PERIOD GENERALLY SPEAKING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IMMUNIZATION PERIODS THAT ARE ARE IN THEIR TWENTIES TO THIRTY YEAR PERIOD. THE. THAT GENERALLY SPEAKING THE COT ESTIMATED. AVERAGE REMAINING SERVICE PERIOD SUBSTANTIALLY BELOW THAT TEND TO TEN TO TWELVE YEARS FELLOW THE. CURRENT. AIM IS ASIAN PERIODS ARE ALL NOTICEABLY LONGER THAN THE AVERAGE REMAINING AYE SERVICE PER IT. FAX MATTER IS IS I CAN KEEP TALKING BUT I WILL LOUDLY LEAVE IT UP TO YOU ALL. APPRECIATE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. IT WILL ALSO BY JESTING A BIT BUT LET ME LET ME ASK YOU. THERE. COUPLE QUESTIONS US SO. DO IT S. OF CAN YOU JUST ELABORATE PERHAPS JUST BRIEFLY ON THE TALK ABOUT THE AMORTIZATION PERIOD THE AVERAGE AVERAGE A SPIRIT BEING POTENTIALLY TWICE AS LONG AS. THE AVERAGE MAY SERVICE PERIOD SO. BUT. BUT DOES THAT MEAN I HAVE FOR ALL OF US VIA YEAH WHAT WHAT IT MORE LIEVENS TERMS YEAH WHAT IT WHAT IT WHAT IT MEANS PARTICULARLY SENSE GENERALLY SPEAKING HE IMMUNIZATION. APPROACH IS A LEVEL PERCENTAGE OF PAY WHAT THAT MEANS IS ARE THE LONGER THE IMMUNIZATION PERIOD THE MORGUE THAT IS BEING SHIFTED TO OUR FUTURE TAXPAYERS SO. IT IT ALSO MEANS. CURRENT BUDGETS ARE A LITTLE BIT EASIER TO LA ALTHOUGH IN MOST MOST MOST OF MY CLIENTS MOST PUBLIC AGENCIES WOULD DISPUTE THIS. CURRENT BUDGETS ARE A LITTLE IT EASIER WITH A LONGER IMMUNIZATION PERIOD THAN WITH A SHORTER. PERIOD BUT YOU'RE REALLY SHIFTING THAT THAT TO FUTURE TAXPAYERS. OKAY I'M SOMEWHAT MORE TONTO TO QUESTION ON YOUR WHAT YOUR PERSPECTIVES ON VALUE BASE INVESTING. PHIL LET ME GIVE YOU MY CAVIAR. BOB I'M AN ACTUARY NOT AN INVESTMENT ADVISOR. POT SO I HAVE A. SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INTEREST IN THAT QUESTION. BOB BUT I'M NOT SURE SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO MY ANSWER. I THINK SAID THAT. I'M NOT PARTICULARLY BASHFUL ABOUT GIVING AN OPINION ON STUFF I'M NOT QUALIFIED TO GIVE AN OPINION KNOWN AS LONG AS EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THAT. AYE FIELD. I AS AN ACTUARY I FEEL AS A LIFETIME RESIDENT OF THE STATE FAMILY WHO HAS WATCH CALPERS AND CAL STURGE FOR A LONG TIME. THAT OUGHT TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU CAN. DO THAT SORT OF INVESTING WITH OUT HAVING AN ADVERSE IMPACT TO THE TAXPAYER. I'M A BIG FAN OF THAT I I. I AM NOT SMART ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND HOW YOU CAN DO THAT SORT OF INVESTING WITH OUT HAVING AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE DISCOUNT RATE THAT. AND SO I WILL ADD. JUST MAKE ONE MINOR CORRECTION TO THE TO THE STATEMENT THAT WAS MADE IN THE FIRST PANEL. YOU SHOULD NOT LOOK AT WHETHER THIS HAS AN IMPACT. BOB RELATIVE TO THE SEVEN PERCENT DISCOUNT RATE IF THE INVESTMENT RETURN WILL BE LOWER IF THERE IS A COST ASSOCIATED WITH DOING MASS. BUT MADISON COST THE TAXPAYERS MUST BEAR THAT'S INDEPENDENT OF WHETHER THE INVEST FOR RETURN IS FIVE PERCENT OR WHETHER THE INVEST FOR RETURNS FIFTEEN PERCENT. AND SO MY MY COMMENT IS TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU CAN DO IT WITHOUT A COST. BUT BUT AGAIN PLEASE REMEMBER MY CAPITA. AS AN ACTUARY SO YOUNG. THE BOARD HAS SAID SEXUALLY INVESTMENT GOALS RIGHT WE'VE LOWERED DOWN TO SUFFERS AS A DISCOUNT RATE. IT IS SO IS YOUR DOING ACTUARY ANALYSIS YOU JUST TAKE THAT. GOAL OR DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION LIKE WELL ACTUALLY THE AND AND IT'S THIS CHALLENGING BECAUSE RETURNS OF COURSE CHANGE EVERY YEAR WERE KINDA LOOKING LONG TERM I KNOW THAT'S WHAT THE INVESTMENT FOLKS ARE LOOKING AT WE. WELL THAT PENSION FUNDS ARE IN THE LONG TERM. AND IT CERTAINLY ANY TIME WHICH IS A DISCOVERY HAS SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES. CONTRIBUTIONS AND SO FORTH. SO WHAT'S YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON. THE SETTING OF THE DISCOUNT RATE BOB. BACH I'LL GIVE YOU COUPLE OF COMMENTS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE COMMENT NUMBER ONE IS I THINK IT SHOULD BE AS TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE. THAT'S NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO. AYE IVAN. BUT DOING ACTUAR WORK FOR A LONG TIME. DISCOVERED IS. BAD NEWS ALWAYS HURTS MORE THAN GOOD NEWS IF YOU PUT THOSE TWO ON A TEETER TOTTER. BAD NWS WAYS MORE PHIL I AM A FAN OF HAVING A SMALL MARGIN FOR I REFER TO IT AS KIND OF A MARGIN FOR ADVERSE DEVIATION SO. MARGIN FOR BAD NEWS IF YOU WELL FELLOW. WIDE PERSONALLY OF LOOKED AT CALPERS DEVELOPMENT OF THE DISCOUNT RATE WE ARE FIRM. DOES NOT IN ANY WORK WE DO WE DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT CALPERS DOES BUT IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY INFLECTED DISCOUNT RATE UP ON ON ON ON OUR SHELF. A. I M. A LITTLE NERVOUS ARM. THAT WHAT CALPERS HAS DONE IN SELECTING THE DISCOUNT RATE IS RELY A LOT ON. ANTICIPATED INVESTMENT RETURN BEYOND THE NEXT DECADE SO A INVESTMENT ADVISORS. ARE. INCREDIBLY RELUCTANT TO LOOK AT INVESTMENT RETURN BEYOND THE BEYOND THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS BUT THEY ALL GIVE. AND EXPECTED RETURN OVER THE NEXT DECADE KIND OF THE ACTUARY'S JOB TO TAKE THAT AND SAY WELL. WHETHER OR NOT WE WERE NOT EXPECTED TO BE AROUND FOR THE NEXT DECADE WERE EXPECTED TO BE AROUND FOR THE NEXT. WHEN THIRTY FIFTY A HUNDRED YEARS. AND SO IT'S THEIR JOB TO TAKE THAT INFORMATION AND ANTICIPATE WHAT THE RETURNS ARE GOING TO BE NOT JUST IN THE NEXT DECADE BEYOND THAT. I'M A LITTLE WORRIED THAT CALPERS IS BEING. IT IS RELYING AYE TOO MUCH ON. ANTICIPATION THAT MARKETS WILL RETURN TO HIS. AVERAGES WHICH GETS TO WALK HIGHER ANTICIPATED RETURN YOU CAN KIND OF SEE THAT IN WHAT THE INVESTMENT ADVISORS ARE TALKING ABOUT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT A. SIX POINT ONE PERSON EVER TO RETURN OVER THE NEXT DECADE CALPERS OF USING SAP AND THEN AND WHAT THAT REALLY MEANS IS CALPERS SIX PACKS INVEST RETURN BEYOND TEN YEARS. TO MAKE UP THAT DIFFERENCE. I'M I'M JUST PERSONALLY WORRIED. THAT THAT IS. BEING MORE OPTIMISTIC THEN. MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE IN THE INTEREST OF FULL DISCLOSURE BUT MOST OF MY CLIENTS WANT THE DISCOUNT RATE TO BE AS HIGH AS POSSIBLE SO THEY CAN FIT INTO THEIR BUDGETS. SOMETIMES THE JOB AN ACTUARY IS TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT THEY DON'T WANT TO HEAR THOUGH. JUST ASK. ALRIGHT ANY OTHER. ALRIGHT WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH I HOPE YOU COVER FROM NICOLE THE HEAD SO I DO THINK NIGHT THANK YOU. SO MUCH. OKAY SO I'D LIKE TO BRING UP BURDEN NEXT VOLKOFF PANEL. WE ADD MISTER DEREK WHEN EXCEL IT'S COUNCIL CAPTIVE VISORS GROUP PROVIDING THE PLAY PERSPECTIVE A POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF PENSION PUBLIC PENSION INVESTMENT A POLICY. WELCOME. AND YOU THINK YOU CHAIR. GOOD AFTERNOON OR GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS DEREK CLINICS ON BEHALF OF A HANDFUL OF SCHOOL EMPLOYER ASSOCIATIONS AND AGENCIES INCLUDING THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS. THE SCHOOL EMPLOYERS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA IN THE SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION. BEFORE GETTING INTO THE HARD THE TOPIC I WANNA PUTTING CONTACTS CONTEXT WHITE SO IMPORTANT FOR US AS SCHOOL EMPLOYERS TO ENGAGE ON THIS ISSUE. WE ALL KNOW THAT A QUALITY EDUCATION ARE PARTICULARLY A QUALITY PUBLIC EDUCATION IS ONLY AS STRONG AS THE EDUCATORS AND STAFF AT THOSE SCHOOLS. MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE ENTER THE PROFESSION FOR THE LOVE OF THE WORK BUT A MAJOR REASON WHY MANY STAY OR FOR THE BENEFITS. AND SO THAT'S NOT LOST ON US IN THE CONNECTION BETWEEN PUBLIC EDUCATION. AND PENSIONS SPECIFICALLY GOES FAR BEYOND JUST CONTRIBUTION RATES AND DISCOUNT RATES FOR US IT COMES DOWN TO RETIREMENT SECURITY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE OFFERING OUR EMPLOYEES. TO STAY IN A FIELD FOR HOPEFULLY THEIR ENTIRE CAREERS WHETHER IT'S AS AN EDUCATOR A STAFF MEMBER OR ADMINISTRATOR AND THIS HELPS US DO THAT. NOW THEM MOTIVATIONS BEHIND MANY OF THE DIVESTED HER. MEASURES THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE ARE VERY UNDERSTANDABLE FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WERE MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY WE SHARE A LOT OF THOSE VALUES. AND OUR SCHOOL EMPLOYER CERTAINLY AREN'T IMMUNE TO THOSE PLEASED TO WORK ON THESE PARTICULAR ISSUES BUT THERE ARE TWO REASONS IN PARTICULAR THAT I WANNA HIGHLIGHT TODAY. FOR WHY WE FAVOR ENGAGEMENT OVER MANDATED DIVESTMENT. IN THE FIRST IS THAT WE BELIEVE THE LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF OUR PENSION FUNDS MUST BE PRIORITIZED OVER. INVESTMENT MANDATES THAT MIGHT HAMPER WITH THE ABILITY FOR THE SYSTEMS TO MAXIMIZE RISK ADJUSTED RETURNS AND RISK ADJUSTED IN OUR VIEW IS A REALLY KEY PHRASE HERE. BECAUSE IT DOES MEAN THAT WE SHOULD JUST INVEST IN EVERYTHING SIMPLY BECAUSE OF WILL MAKE THE MOST MONEY I'M OF COURSE NOT A AS THE FIRST PANEL DESCRIBERS ALWAYS GOING TO BE RISKS INVOLVED. WE HAVE TO BE COGNIZANT ABOUT THAT IT'S JUST THAT OUR OPINION IS THAT THE PEOPLE MOST QUALIFIED TO MAKE THOSE RISK ADJUSTMENT ADJUSTED DECISIONS ARE THE FOLKS THAT SIT IN THE BUILDINGS THAT CALTRANS AND CALPERS. AND THE VARIOUS CONSULTANTS AND CAN BY ADVISERS THAT THEY USE NOT NECESSARILY ON THE ONE OFF INVESTMENT MANDATES THAT WE SEE FROM YEAR TO YEAR. IN FACT IT'S THOSE MANDATES THAT OF COST THE CALPERS SYSTEM IN PARTICULAR. OVER EIGHT OR EIGHT POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN COUNTING NOW SCHOOL EMPLOYERS REPRESENT ABOUT FORTY PERCENT OF THE CALPERS SYSTEM IN TERMS OF MEMBERSHIP SO THAT'S A REALLY BIG NUMBER FOR US. I'M IN AS EMPLOYERS THIS MEAN SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER COSTS FOR OUR EMPLOYEES IT REALLY EXPANDS ON THE QUESTION MARK AROUND RETIREMENT SECURITY. SO ULTIMATELY WE IN THE STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY NEED FOR FROM A COUPLE OF US TODAY WERE ALL IN THE SAME BOAT WHETHER YOUR EMPLOYERAND EMPLOYEE. APPARENT OR RETIRE RE THE GOAL AROUND STAYS DISCUSSION IN OUR VIEW SHOULD REALLY BE ABOUT THE QUESTION OF RETIREMENT SECURITY AND WHETHER DIVESTMENT MANDATES ON A ONE OFF BASIS. ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE THAT FOR EMPLOYEES BECAUSE AGAIN IT ALL GOES BACK TO OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL SERVICES FOR STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE. NOW I KNOW THAT I'M THE FIFTH PANEL THE PARTICULARS GONNA REALLY I TOUCH ON THIS ISSUE SO I'M ONLY GOING TO MENTION IT A WHICH IS THAT WHEN WE LEAVE THE TABLE WE WHO HAVE THOSE CALIFORNIA VALUES WHEN WE SELL THOSE SHARES. WERE OFTEN SELLING IT TOO INVESTORS WHO ARE. MAYBE AGNOSTIC TO THOSE CALIFORNIA VALUES AND THAT'S A BIG CONCERN FOR US BECAUSE WE SHARE THOSE VALUES AS WELL AND SO WE WOULD MUCH RATHER SEE THE LEGISLATURE FOCUS ON. HELPING THE SYSTEMS MAXIMIZE THOSE RISK ADJUSTED RETURNS SO TO CONCLUDE DIVESTMENT MANDATES HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE ABILITY FOR SCHOOL EMPLOYERS TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN THE BEST EDUCATORS. AND ALSO IMPACTS OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL SERVICES WHEN WE PAY TO MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE ON THOSE INVESTMENT LOSSES THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER. SO I REALLY ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER A POLICY THAT WILL HOPEFULLY REPLACE THOSE ONE OFF DIVESTMENT MANDATE MEASURES WITH AN APPROACH THAT WEIGHS THE OPPORTUNITY COSTS AND KEEPS IN MIND THE IMPACT. A CALIFORNIA'S EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH FOR PRESENTATION. IT'S BEFORE. WE ASK QUESTIONS IT'S ALSO WANT TO WELCOME US THEIR LEYVA WHO SERVED WITH ME ON THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE SO THAT IT FAR REASON ALL OF US WERE LATE. INNOVATIVE. A ARE ALSO JUST A BRIEF COMMENT. THAT REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING UP. THE FACT THAT. RECOGNIZING NOW ONLY OF COURSE WE HOLD THESE FUNDS IN TRUST FOR PROMISES THAT WERE MADE THAT WE HAVE A PUBLIC POLICY VERY POOR PUBLIC POLICY REASON FOR MAINTAINING. THE PUBLIC TRUST IN THESE PENSIONS WHICH IS IS THAT. THE RETIREES INITIATIVE. BE ABLE TO KNOWLEDGE COURTS UP TO RECRUIT BUT ALSO A IF THE RETIREES THEMSELVES DON'T HAVE A SOLID. SECURE RETIREMENT. THAT SHE BECOMES A FUTURE COSTS FOR US IN STATE GOVERNMENT WE ARE FINE WE WILL BE FINE YOURSELVES DEALING. WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF POVERTY AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS. WHEN AT AT AND FRANKLY MOST OF THE PENSIONS THEMSELVES THE CIRCUIT PEOPLE ABOVE WATER% NOT THEIR NET NET IS NOT BIG PAYDAY IT'S VERY MODEST SO. THAT IT DOES SERVE A VERY IMPORTANT PUBLIC POLICY GOAL WITH AID TENET COST IRWIN IF IF WE DON'T MAINTAIN STABILITY IN OUR PENSIONS IS AS WELL IN THAT. COST WILL BE BORNE BY TAXPAYERS SO WOULD YOU LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE TAXPAYER COST FOR THE PENSION THE LET'S TALK ABOUT THE TAXPAYER COST. THE FUTURE AS WELL FOR ARE THE CONSEQUENCES OF OF OF OF HAVING OURS STATE EMPLOYEES ARE TEACHERS THAT MANY OTHER PEOPLE COVERED BY THESE PENSIONS ARE. NOW HAVING TO BE ON THE PUBLIC DOLE POTENTIALLY SELL. SHE DIED. DO QUESTIONS FOR PANELISTS. BUT AS OUR LEYVA. I WOULD JUST OF MAKE A COMMENT THAT YOU KNOW I I TO WORRY ABOUT THE DIVESTMENT. BECAUSE I THINK OUR FIRST OBLIGATION IS TO THE PENSIONERS THE RETIREES ARE WHILE WE ALWAYS WANT TO BE MINDFUL OF PEOPLE THAT ARE. YOU KNOW TOBACCO OR WHATEVER INDUSTRY THAT WE CHOOSE AT THE TIME THAT. THAT WE DON'T LIKE TO BE AFFILIATED WITH WHEN WE DIVEST FROM ONE COMPANY. I JUST THINK WE SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE SOMEONE ELSE THAT WE'RE GOING TO INVEST IN OR WIND UP HURTING THE PEOPLE THAT WERE TRYING TO PROTECT AND TO CENTER PANTS POINT. IT WILL COST US IN THE LONG RUN SO APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND HAPPY TO BE HERE AND HE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY SO LET'S BRING UP OUR NEXT PANEL. WHICH ARE ACTUALLY. YOU HAVE THE. IS THERE A. MISTER JACQUI THIS SO. WELL NO ACTUALLY THOUGH DO WE HAVE ENOUGH WE DO HAVE ENOUGH CHAIRS FOR A FOREIGN. NEED TO KILL US SIR IS THERE DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER CHAIR WE CAN BRING IN. OUT THERE WE GO WE HAVE THERE'S ANOTHER CHAIR. ALRIGHT. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE'VE I HAVE QUESTIONS FOR ALL FOUR OF YOU ETCETERA. SO FIRST ALIVE BUT I THINK. JACQUI THE CEO OF FAT COW STIRS AS WELL AS CHRIS ALMOND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER. AND THEN MARS FROST THAT CEO OF CALPERS WITH. AND SIMPSON. WHO'S THE. IF INVEST IN OFFICE NOT A YEAR THE STATE OF. I HAVE. A FULL BLOWN. OKAY. AND I SAID LISTEN DIRECTORS THE INABILITY FOR A CALPERS AS WELL WELCOME. I WILL GO AHEAD WHAT WILL WE GO AHEAD START WITH THAT MISTER ENOS FIRST THEN WE'LL DO CASTERS AND THEN A WHOLE WHICH OVER TO A CALPERS SENDS A LOCAL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. AND I THINK YOU COMMITTEE FOR DE SCHEDULING THIS A VERY TOPICAL ISSUE IT'S A ISSUE NOT JUST BEING DISCUSSED HERE IN SACRAMENTO BUT SPRINGFIELD IN ALBANY AND. TALLAHASSEE BECAUSE ALL PENSION FUNDS ARE. STRUGGLING WITH LIABILITIES AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE THEY STAY HEALTHY SO WE APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH. OF THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK THAT A SUBMARINE COOLEY OUTLINED FOR ALL OF US IS ABSOLUTELY BUT WE LIVE BY. OF THE SYSTEM EVERY DAY. SO I WON'T I WON'T REITERATE THAT THAT WAS A PERFECT A LEGAL HUNT DESCRIPTION OF WHAT WE DO. AND YOU KNOW THE WORD I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH IS WHAT YOU SAID MISTER CHAIRMAN A MINUTE AGO AND WHAT WE THINK ABOUT EVERY DAY AS THAT WORD LONG TERM. AND I HOPE WE'LL JUST KIND OF ABSORBED THAT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE ISSUE AND HOW TO FRAME THE ISSUE HOW TO STRATEGIZE THE ISSUE AND I. I GUESS I WOULD LIKE TO PUT JUST A A HUMAN FACE ON THIS RELATIVE TO CAL STIRRERS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT LONG TERM WE'RE. ONE THE OLDEST PENSION FUNDS IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY OVER OVER A HUNDRED YEARS OLD IN WHAT WE DO. OUR AT. TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN ASSETS THIS WEEK BUT MOST IMPORTANT ABOUT THE PEOPLE THE SYSTEM TIS IS A SYSTEM THAT IS PREDOMINATELY FEMALE. OB SEVENTY TWO PERCENT FEMALE AND. HERE'S A NUMBER TO TAKE HOME TO YOUR FAMILY WE HAVE OVER THREE HUNDRED RETIREES. THAT ARE OVER A HUNDRED YEARS OLD. SO. WELL IT IS YOU SHOULD APPRECIATE THIS BUT I GIVE YOU THE NEXT NUMBER IS THAT IS THAT WOMEN BECAUSE BECAUSE OUR OLDEST MEMBER IS A HUNDRED AND NINE. YEARS OLD. SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE DECISIONS WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT TODAY AND HOW YOU AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO FUND THOSE PENSIONS. THAT IT'S ABSOLUTELY FROM THE CENTER ONE OF THE BIG WE GIVE YOU TALKED A LITTLE BIT ALREADY THIS MORNING BUT INVESTMENT ASSUMPTIONS YOU DIDN'T TALK ABOUT. CHANGES IN MORTALITY ASSUMPTIONS AND WE JUST ADJUSTED THOSE AT CAL STIRS. AND AGAIN FOR WOMEN. WOULD BE A NOW EXPECTED LIFE EXPECTANCY FOR A WOMAN WHO REACHES AGE SIXTY TWO WAS DOWN NINETY YEARS. OLD. IT'S NOT JUST A REMARKABLE NUMBER BUT WHAT MOST OF EVERYBODY ESPECIALLY PHYSICIANS KNOW THAT WOMEN LIVE LONGER THAN MEN BUT WHAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW. IS THAT FEMALE TEACHERS LIVE LONGER THAN FEMALES RIGHT NOW THE ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTION AROUND A FEMALE IN OUR SYSTEM. IS SIX YEARS HIGHER. BEEN A FEMALE IN THE GENERAL POPULATION SO WHEN YOU THINK YEAH I I WHO A WE HAVE WE SHARE SO MANY THINGS IN COMMON WITH CALPERS BUT WE ALSO HAVE DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHICS AND ACTUARIAL ISSUES BETWEEN THE SYSTEM. AND I I SAY THAT BECAUSE LONG TERM IS ABSOLUTELY CHRIS AS CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER WHAT I THINK ABOUT EVER EVERY SINGLE DAY. NOW CREEK CHRIS AND I ARE THAT OLD BUT I DO WANNA SAY THAT CHRIS IS BEEN WITH US IS CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER EIGHTEEN YEARS I'VE BEEN IN S. REALISTIC IO SIXTEEN YEARS. SO WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH A LOT OF ISSUES A LOT OF UPS AND DOWNS. AND THE POINT YOU MADE ABSOLUTELY. THE RECESSION HAS REFRAINED RISK MANAGEMENT AND HOW WE THINK ABOUT THAT IN THIS BUSINESS NEWS SO RELEVANT OF YOU'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT TODAY. WE KIND OF YOURSELVES A CALPERS WE WEAR THREE SETS A CO CLOSE WITH THE CAMERA WHERE FINANCIAL SERVICES ORGANIZATION WE HAVE TO BEHAVE LIKE THE PRIVATE SECTOR MOST DAYS OF THE WEEK INTERACT WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR EVERYDAY. BUT THEN WE COME HERE WITH YOU. WE'RE STATE AGENCY WE'VE GOT PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES IN OUR IN OUR MIDST EVERY DAY AND WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE THAT OUT. BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT TRUMP CARD IN THIS IS BEING THE TRUST FUND. AND BEING THE FIDUCIARY AS IT MIXES WITH THOSE OTHER ISSUES. YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY AND YOU MAY SHARE THIS VIEW THE PUBLIC VIEW WALL STREET IS NEGATIVE. IT IS THERE'S A WONDERFUL DOCUMENT THAT COMES OUT EVERY YEAR CALLED THE ADLEMAN TRUST BAROMETER MEASURES TRUST IN BUSINESS. UNFORTUNATE FINANCIAL SERVICES SINCE THE RECESSION IS THE LEAST. TRUSTED. INDUSTRY SECTOR OF ALL INDUSTRY SECTORS AND I THINK THAT PART OF IT IS THE ISSUE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. THERE'S A PERCEPTION THAT WALLSTREET OPERATES WITH LITTLE REGARD OF THE SOCIAL IMPACT OF WHAT WE DO. SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE CONTRAST THAT WITH WHAT WE SEE HOW IT FRAMES ARE BUSINESS. SO WE IN FACT DO HAVE VALUES AND BELIEFS THAT GUIDE THE SYSTEM THERE FORMALLY ADOPTED BY OUR BOARD FACT KAREN YAMAMOTO KAREN YET REGION. IS WEBER BOARD MEMBERS. SHE'S A TRUSTS A DE ANNA RETIREE THAT IS ON OUR BOARD AND THEY HAVE ADOPTED BELIEVES THAT ALL REGION THE ONE THAT APPLIES TO TODAY. CALPERS BELIEVES THAT IN ADDITION TO TRADITIONAL* IN ADDITION TO RADITIONAL FINANCIAL METRICS. TIMELY CONSIDERATION OF MATERIAL ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE FACTORS IN THE INVESTMENT PROCESS FOR EVERY ASSET CLASS. HAS THE POTENTIAL OVER THE LONG TERM. A POSITIVELY IMPACT INVESTMENT RETURNS SO RATHER THAN PUSHING AWAY FROM THIS ISSUE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT I WANNA MAKE SURE YOU HEAR THAT WERE FOOT BRACE THE. AND CHRIS WILL TALK IN DETAIL HOUSE EMBRACED INVESTMENT STRATEGY BUT THIS IS AN OF RUNNING FROM THE ISSUE. IT'S EMBRACING IT TO SEE HOW THE RISK MANAGEMENT. THIS CAN IMPROVE WHAT WE'RE DOING. SO IT'S THE INTEGRATION OF THAT INVESTMENT BELIEF THAT THE CHALLENGE FORECASTERS. AND OUT I JUST TO MAKE TWO FINAL POINTS ONE IS YOU OFTEN TALK ABOUT. DIVESTMENT RELATIVE TO OIL AND GAS THAT THAT BRINGS EVERYONE INTO THE CONVERSATION. I WANNA MAKE SURE YOU THINK OF ANY BUSINESS THE WATER BOTTLES WHAT HAPPENS THOSE WATER BOTTLES AFTER WE DRINK OF THE CLOTHING WE WEAR HOUSE THE WATER MANAGE THE GOT INTO THIS CLOTHING. WHO SOURCE THIS IN ANOTHER COUNTRY IN CHILD LABOR? BOARDS ARE THEY DIVERSE OR DO THEY REFLECT A MALE DOMINATED THINGS. YOU THINK OF ANY INDUSTRY AND THESE RISKS EXISTED THAT'S A WE CANNOT DIVEST AWAY FROM. WHOLE MARKET. IT PERVADES ALL INDUSTRIES IN WHAT WE DO CLOSING COMMENT IS THE FUNDING I CANNOT SAY ANY AYE SIX UP THIS POINT. YOU TOOK MOMENTOUS STEP WITH US IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN TO PUT US ON THE RIGHT TRACK THE FUNDING PLAN IS ON TRACK. BUT WE MUST CAREFULLY PROTECT THAT FUNDING PLAN AND WHAT WE DO WE'RE GOING TO DELIVER TO YOU IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN A FULL ANALYSIS OF THAT FUNDING PLAN. TELL YOU WHERE WE ARE WITH IT BUT IN THE MEANTIME WE DO AN ANNUAL REPORT TO OUR BOARD TO KAREN. AND THE OTHER TRUSTEES AND THAT BOARD ANALYZES THE RISKS AROUND THIS. I'M GONNA LEAVE YOU ONE NUMBER THAT SHOULD WORRY ALL OF US HERE. AND THAT IS IF WE MAKE THE WRONG DECISIONS HERE THE WRONG STRATEGIES AND MOVE WE IMPACT THAT. ARE RETURNED JUST ZERO POINT ONE PERCENT ZERO POINT ONE PERCENT LESS THAN OUR ASSUMPTIONS. THAT WOULD HAVE A FISCAL IMPACT OF EIGHTEEN PLUS BILLION DOLLARS OVER THIRTY YEARS. STATE TO SCHOOLS EXCEPT FOR THAT'S THE MARGIN YOU GOTTA THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH THESE ISSUES. SO SO PLEASE RECOGNIZE THE NEXUS OF WHAT WE DO HERE TODAY. AND THE FUNDING OF THE PLAN. THANKS. THANK YOU JACK. TRY TO KEEP. BOSTON GLOBE DOT. BUT ABOUT HAAS AYE WILL BE EFFICIENT BOOK IF. A SENATOR SETTLEMENT THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS HEARING OF PLEASURE TO BE HERE. INVESTMENT WHEN ME LEAVE YOU WITH A COUPLE CLEAR THOUGHTS DIVEST SPENT IS AN ACTIVE CELL DECISION. YOU ARE TELLING US THAT THAT COMPANY OR THAT INDUSTRY. IS NOT ALLOWED FOR US TO INVEST IN. AND YOU TAKE ARE VOICE OUT OF THE DISCUSSION COMPLETELY. WE GIVE A THOUGHT HOPEFULLY CAN RELATE TO IF THERE'S SOMEBODY A LANDOWNER IN YOUR DISTRICT AND THEY'RE NOT HAPPY WITH WHAT YOU'RE DOING. ARE THEY BETTER OFF COMING TO YOUR OFFICE MAKING AN APPOINTMENT AND RAISING THEIR VOICE. OR SELLING THEIR LAND MOVING TO THE NEXT DISTRICT. YOU DON'T CARE IF THEY SOLD THEIR LAND THEY DIDN'T SULFUR LOST SOMEBODY ELSE BOUGHT IT. WE DON'T WANT TO BOTHER YOU AT ALL THAT'S WHAT OU DO TO US WHEN YOU FORCE US INTO DIVEST MEANT. WE NOW HAVE TURNED OUR BACK AND I CAN TELL YOU BECAUSE I MET WITH COMPANIES THEY DON'T KNOW OR CARE WHETHER WE OWN THE STOCKS ARE NOT. THERE ARE TWO WAYS TO INVEST GENERALLY ACTIVE AND PASSIVE JODY FROM TRILLION MENTIONED THAT. THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY IN EXPERTS AGREE THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY FOR US TO INVEST BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IS TO DO IT IN A STYLE CALLED INDEXING WE OWN THE ENTIRE MARKET. MANY OF YOU HEARD OF THE SNP FIVE HUNDRED YOU HOLD ALL FIVE HUNDRED STOCKS. WE EMPEROR'S OWN BOTHER INDEXES WE ON THREE THOUSAND STOCKS IN THE UNITED STATES. BUT WHEN WE START TO DIVEST ALL OF A SUDDEN WE ON TWO THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO STOCKS. WE CAN'T TRADE WITH SOMEBODY ELSE AS A WHOLE UNIT WE DON'T OWN THE ENTIRE MARKET. AND WE'RE STARTING TO CUT AWAY AT THAT MORE AND MORE IN GETTING CLOSER TO THAT ONE TENTH OF A PERCENT THE JACK MENTIONED. THAT'S GONNA EAT INTO OUR. RETURNS GOING LONG TERM. WE CARE PASSIONATELY ABOUT MANY OF THE SOCIAL ISSUES AS JACK SAID WE BELIEVE ANY S. T. WE CARE ABOUT THESE THINGS. BUT WE ALSO KNOW WE NEED TO EARN A RETURN FOR THE FOR THE STAKEHOLDERS. THE VESTMENT IS LARGELY SYMBOLIC. IT'S MAKING A STATEMENT. BUT IT COSTS US BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. SO WHEN WE MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO WE WANT TO DO IT INCREDIBLY COST EFFECTIVE AND WHEN I LOOKED AT THE TITLE OF YOUR HEARING. REPRESENTING THE VALUES OF CALIFORNIA TO ME AND MY STAFF ARE FIRST IMPORTANT VALUE IS TO ACHIEVE R. ESTIMATED RETURN. IF THE COST OF THE SYSTEM AS LOW AS POSSIBLE FOR YOU IN THE MEMBERS. THAT'S RIGHT IN THE CONSTITUTION AS YOU CITED THAT'S OUR MANDATE. SO WE SHARE THE VALUES OF CALIFORNIA. IF WE MEET THAT RETURN ASSUMPTION AND KEEP THE COSTS LOW. THE MORE WE CHANGE HOW WERE ALLOWED TO INVEST THE MORE YOU RESTRICT UNIVERSE. INCREASES ARE COST NOT ONLY ARE OPPORTUNITY COST OF NOT BEING ABLE INVEST IN THOSE AREAS. BUT EVEN OUR TRADING COSTS THE INABILITY FOR US TO MOVE THOSE BLOCKS OF STOCKS AS AN ENTIRE WHOLE UNIT. AS JACK SAID WE EMBRACE CSG WE HAVE A LOUD VOICE WE GO WHEN WE MEET WITH MULTIPLE COMPANIES WE'VE SENT OUR STAFF AND WE BROUGHT ABOUT CHANGE. NOT AS FAST AS OTHER PEOPLE OF WANTED. BUT WHAT WE DO IS WE EDUCATE. THE LIKE MY NAM THE EXAMPLE OF THAT MEMBER IN YOUR DISTRICT IT'S NOT HAPPY WITH WHAT YOU'RE DOING. THEY'RE GONNA COME IN AND TALK TO YOU YOU'RE GONNA HEAR WHAT THEIR CONCERN IS AND SO WE'RE GONNA EDUCATORS WHILE. SO I WOULD ASK YOU TO REALLY TAKE THE TIME TO THINK ABOUT THOSE KINDA DIVESTMENT BILLS. YOU'RE MAKING AN ACTIVE CELL DECISION. BUT THEN YOU ASK THE BOARDS WHO ARE FIDUCIARY SO TO MAKE THAT ACTIVE DECISION. AND AS I'M SAYING WE DON'T KNOW SO I BELIEVE AN ACTIVE MANAGEMENT ITS PROVEN TO BE VERY EXPENSIVE AND VERY TOUGH. YOU WANT TO BRING ABOUT SOCIAL CHANGE. THIS HASN'T PROVEN EFFECTIVE DIVESTMENT HAS NOT BROUGHT ABOUT SOCIAL CHANGE. BUT IT'S COST US BILLIONS. A QUESTION CAME UP EARLIER WHAT'S APOSTAS. FIVE POINT FIVE BILLION IS WHAT IT'S COST US TODAY MCALISTER'S. THANK YOU IT AND WE WILL HAVE SOME WILL HAVE SOME QUESTIONS TO SAY I'M SURE IT WILL BE MORE OPPORTUNITIES ELABORATE AYE VOICE START WITH CALPERS AWAY GET NOW WELCOME A CENTER MORE LOCKED. BEING HERE AS WELL. THE ACROSS. GOOD MORNING SENATOR PAN ASSEMBLYMEMBER RODRIGUEZ AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY SINCE COMING TO CALIFORNIA TO INTERACT WITH SEVERAL OF YOU ON ON THIS TOPIC AS BILLS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED. TO REALLY SHARE THE CALPERS POSITION ON DIVESTITURE. AND RATHER THAN REPEATING MUCH OF WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN SAID BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE QUESTIONS AND I ALSO PREFER THAT INTERACTION IN THAT DIALOGUE. AND I WE JUST HAD IT AT A COUPLE OF COMMENTS AND I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO HE AND SIMPSON TO GIVE YOU SOME VERY SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF WHERE WE THINK WE'VE HAD SUCCESS WITH ENGAGEMENT. AYE MR ELEOCHARIS HE WAS SCHEDULED TO BE HERE WITH US THIS MORNING IS AT JURY DUTY. OTHERWISE I KNOW HE WOULD HAVE HAVE ENJOYED THIS HEARING AS WELL. SO JUST A LITTLE BIT OF INFORMATION ABOUT CALPERS WE SERVE ABOUT TWO TWO MILLION MEMBERS ARE NOT INCLUDING THEIR THREE HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION. ON BUT OUR LIABILITIES WHICH IS REALLY THE THE MEMBERSHIP THE PENSION BENEFITS FOR ABOUT A HALF TRILLION. SO YOU TAKE THAT MATH AND THAT LEASES TO ABOUT A SIXTY EIGHT PERCENT FUNDED STAFF. THAT IS THE NUMBER ONE THING WE HAVE ON OUR MIND AT CALPERS IT'S ON THE MIND OF THE INVESTORS. WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE IT IS AND CERTAINLY ON THE MINDS OF OUR BOARD. WHEN WE TALK TO OUR MEMBERS WE TALK TO OUR EMPLOYERS THE ONE THING THE MEMBER IS MOST CONCERNED ABOUT IS WHETHER THERE BENEFIT IS SAFE. IS THAT BENEFIT GOING TO BE THERE AT THE TIME THAT I RETIRED SO MOST CRITICAL THING ON THEIR MIND OUR CONTACT CENTER IS INUNDATED WITH PHONE CALLS BECAUSE THAT SIXTY EIGHT PERCENT NUMBER. IS ARE ALARMING TO THEM. FOR THE EMPLOYERS AND THEY'RE A VERY IMPORTANT STAKEHOLDER. I HAVE WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT TO THEM IS THAT THE SYSTEM REMAIN AFFORDABLE FOR THAT IT BECOMES MORE AFFORDABLE. AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT DECISIONS LIKE ACID ALLOCATION AND WE LOOK AT DECISIONS LIKE DISCOUNT RATE WERE BALANCING NOT SUSTAINABILITY OF THE FIND BOTH FROM THE MEMBERS PERSPECTIVE AS WELL AS FROM THE EMPLOYER. SO JUST QUICKLY I WE DID LEAVE YOU SOME MATERIALS THAT TALK ABOUT OUR INVESTMENT BELIEVES MUCH LIKE CASTERS WE DO HAVE BELIEFS THAT GUIDE OUR DECISIONS. AYE WE THINK THAT THE INVESTMENT BELIEVES CREATE MORE OF A COMMENT EXPECTATION AS WELL AS DIRECTION FROM THE BOARD. FROM OTHER STAKEHOLDERS INTO THE INVESTMENT OPERATION ITSELF. AND SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT NGUYEN TO ENGAGE ON ISSUE OFFICIALLY FOR AIR AREAS ARE FOUR THINGS THAT WE THINK ABOUT. ON THE FIRST IS THE ALIGNMENT WITH THE PRINCIPLES AND THE INVESTMENT BELIEVES THAT AGAIN YOU HAVE A COPY OF IN YOUR FOLDERS. AND THE SECOND IS WHETHER THE ISSUE HAS A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FUNDS. AND WE CAN GET INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF ISSUES IN A NUMBER OF ITEMS THAT TAKE OUR EYE OFF THE BALL THAT THE BALL REALLY IS CREATING THAT MATERIAL. IMPACT AND SIDE WORKING ON GETTING A BETTER FUNDED STATUS FOR THIS BOND. AND THEN ALSO THAT OUR INFLUENCE IS LIKELY TO GENERATE AND MEASURABLE OUTCOME OR IF WE PARTNER WITH PARTNERS LIKE CAL CASTERS OR NEW YORK OR. ATTACHED. TEACHERS CAN WE ALSO MAKE OUR VOICE WHICH IS LOUD ON ITS OWN I WILL TELL YOU CALPERS HAS A VERY LOUD VOICE WHEN WE ENGAGED. BUT IT DOES BECOME MUCH. MORE LOUD WHEN WE CAN. PARTNER UP WITH SOME OF THE OTHER PUBLIC PENSION PLANS. AND IN THE FOURTH IS THAT WE ACTUALLY OF THE CAPACITY THE EXPERTISE AND RESOURCES TO ENGAGEMENT IN THE RIGHT WAY. SIGN UP BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA TURN IT OVER AND BECAUSE I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT YOU HEAR SOME VERY SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF WHERE WE THINK WE'VE HAD SUCCESS AROUND ENGAGEMENT. AND AGAIN WHEN I THINK DOCTOR PAN. COMMITTEE MEMBER COOLEY AND REALLY LOOKING AT THIS FROM THAT MEMBER PERSPECTIVE AND THAT PRUDENT PERSON AND THAT PRUDENT EXPERTS AND THAT'S REALLY THE ROLE OF THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE BOARD AS WELL AS THE STAFF AT CALPERS. I'M. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A IS VERY GOOD TO BE WITH HIS. S. MORNING ARM MY JAVA CALPERS IS TO TAKE THIS. HIGHFALUTIN IDEA I'VE SUSTAINABILITY AND TURN IT INTO SOMETHING PRACTICAL. AND. AS MOLESEY REFERENCED IN OUR INVESTMENT BELIEVES WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THE IMPASSE ANGIE. WE TALK ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY OF THE FARM. BECAUSE THAT'S OUR PRIME RESPONSIBILITY TO OUR MEMBERS. AND WHEN WE LOOKING ATTIRE INVESTMENT RESPONSIBILITIES WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WHAT I'LL DO TWO YEARS IS TO MANAGE FINANCIAL CAPITAL. BUT THAT'S WHEN HIS ARM DOESN'T PRODUCE FINALLY. FINANCIAL CAPITAL HAS TO BE JOINED WITH HUMAN CAPITAL. PEOPLE COMMUNITIES CONSUMERS SUPPLY CHAINS HUMAN CAPITAL IS VITAL TO INVESTMENT RETURNS. AND WE ALSO KNOW THE PHYSICAL CAPITAL WHAT SOMETIMES WITH NATURAL CAPITAL IS VITALLY IMPORTANT. COMPANIES LOOKING AT ISSUES LIKE WATER SHORTAGE WILL THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ARM OF HAVING TO MANAGE. MAINSTREAM BUSINESS ISSUES SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IN OUR INVESTMENT BELIEVES IS RATHER THAN TALK ABOUT YES GEE WE TALK ABOUT LONG TERM VALUE CREATION. AND THE NEED TO MANAGE THESE THREE FORMS OF CAPITAL. SO WHEN WE LOOK IT'S ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES OR LOOK AT HUMAN RIGHTS OR LABOR ISSUES WHICH TALKING ABOUT HOW DO THEY PROTECT. THE RISK AND RETURN OF THE FUND. CERTAIN OUR EXPERIENCE A CALPERS THIS IS NOT A TRADEOFF BETWEEN. DO YOU DO THE RIGHT THING OR DO YOU GO OUT THERE TO MAKE MONEY WHAT WE KNOWING GLOBAL MARKETS IS THAT COMPANIES NEED TO RECRUIT THE BEST TALENT. THE NEED TO BEHAVE RESPONSIBLY TO MANAGE RISK AND CERTAINLY THEY NEED TO BE TACKLING. THE RISKS AS WELL AS THE OPPORTUNITIES OF THINGS LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE. SO WE DON'T JUST I SHOTS OURSELVES IN A ROOM AND COME TO THAT CONCLUSION WE WHEN WE STARTED LOOKING AT A STRATEGY FOR THE TOTAL FUND. WE DID A VERY COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF ALL THE ACADEMIC PAPERS THAT WERE OUT THERE ON THE FIRST TIME WHICH AFLOAT WE FOUND EIGHT HUNDRED. AND THE SECOND TIME WE TOOK A LOT LAST YEAR WE WERE CLOSE TO TWO THOUSAND PAPERS SO WE REALLY FEEL WE'VE GONE ABOUT THIS IN A VERY RIGOROUS WHY WE'D BE GLAD TO SHARE THE EVIDENCE WITH YOU. IT'S HELPFUL SO JUST TO FINISH TWO PRACTICAL EXAMPLES OF WHAT DOES THIS LOOK LIKE WHEN YOU SAY THAT YOU'RE GOING TO ENGAGE OWN FINANCIAL HUMAN. AND PHYSICAL CAPITAL. NOW CLIMATE CHANGE ARM IS AN ISSUE THAT'S GOING TO AFFECT OUR PORTFOLIO GLOBALLY. AND IT'S NOT ALL DOOM AND GLOOM IT'S NOT JUST A STORY OF EXTREME TEMPERATURE AROUND EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS. I'M WATER SHORTAGE AND FLOODING IS ALSO A STORY ABOUT OPPORTUNITY. IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE TRANSITION IN THE WORLD'S ENERGY SECTOR TO GO FROM HIGH COLTON TO RENEWABLES THAT'S A THIRTY YEAR TRANSITION WHICH THAT'S FANTASTIC NEED FOR INVESTMENT. I'M WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITIES FOR INVESTORS TO TAKE. SO WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS ENGAGE THE COMPANIES AT THE HEART OF THIS TRANSITION AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE THAT TWENTY FIVE YEAR TRANSITION AND STILL BE IN BUSINESS. NOW IF WE WALK AWAY. TWO THINGS ONE IS WAS RIGHT HE SAID WE SALAS SHASTA SOMEONE ELSE WHO MAY NOT SHARE THE VALUES OF THE CALIFORNIA REPRESENTS. BUT ALSO WE'VE LOST THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE ANY INFLUENCE ACTUAL. AND THERE IS MY WORLD GOVERNMENT WHICH CAN DRIVE THIS CHANGE. OWNERS OF COMPANIES HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY ON THE RIGHTS OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY MITCHELL THIS TRANSITION TAKES PLACE A LOT IS GOING TO PROTECT INVESTMENT RETURNS FROM MEMBERS. THE SECOND EXAMPLE IS DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION. WE SEE EXCELLENT EVIDENCE THAT COMPANIES NEEDING TO ATTRACT THE BEST TALENT AVAILABLE NOT CONFINE THEMSELVES TO ONE TINY SECTION OF THE POPULATION. DIVERSITY COLLUSION IS GOOD FOR TALENT MANAGEMENT IS GOOD FORENSURING YOU DON'T HAVE GROUP THINK. AS LAWSUIT. SOCIAL JUSTICE REASONS TO FOSTER DIVERSITY INCLUSION BUT WE SEE THE GOOD RESULTS THAT COMPANIES CAN CAPTURE IF THEY HAVE OF A DIVERSE AND INCLUSIVE CULTURE. SO WE'RE PURSUING NOT FROM AN INVESTMENT POINT TRIBUNE CURRENTLY. WITH CAO STARS ARE A WITH OTHER-FORMS WITH ENGAGING OVER FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES RIGHT NOW WHICH HAVE ENTIRELY MILD BOARDS. BECAUSE WE THINK THAT'S COMPANIES RUSHING MISSING OUT ON THAILAND IS GOING TO HELP THEM WITH RETURNS. SO IN CONCLUSION I THINK THAT IS A FALSE CHOICE. A WHAT WAS ONCE CALLED BY THE SEA OF JOHNSON AND JOHNSON IS THE. TYRANNY OF THE OR. IT'S NOT EITHER COOL IT'S ISLAND AND AS WELL LESS SO IN OTHER WORDS I HAVE YOU IS THAT BY FOCUSING ON HUMAN CAPITAL. AND LOOKING AT PHYSICAL CAPITAL OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT WE COMBAT SUPPORT TECH PENSIONS BECAUSE WE GOT BASS OF RISK MANAGEMENT AND WE ALSO HAVE GOOD EVIDENCE WITH AND TO GET BETTER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH. QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. CORD OKAY CENTER MORLOCK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. WELL CHRIS. I'VE ALWAYS OF. FALL THE DICTUM THAT. WHICH THAT MANAGERS MANAGE. AND IT'S YOUR JOB. TO INVEST THE FUNDS. AND I'M EMPOWERING YOU TO DO THE BEST YOU CAN COULD YOU GET THE BLOOMBERG TERMINALS IN FRONT IDEA. YOU'VE GOT MONEY MANAGERS THAT YOU'VE HIRED YOU GOT. OUTSIDE MONEY MANAGERS INSIDE. AND SO. YOU GET THE FAA'S SO SO I WANT YOU TO TO DO THE BEST YOU POSSIBLY CAN. ON BEHALF OF THE TAXPAYERS THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING. SO I GUESS THE FIRST QUESTION WOULD BE. WELL WHEN DO YOU SAY TO THE LEGISLATURE. I THINK YOUR BILL IS TERRIBLE AND EVEN IF YOU VOTE FOR IT AND THE GOVERNOR SIGNS THAT. WE'RE NOT GONNA DO. SO WE'VE TAKEN. USUALLY AT OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON EVERY SINGLE DIVESTMENT BILL. WE'VE TRIED TO PUT WORDS INTO THE GOVERNOR COULD SAVE REPRESENTATIVE ON OUR BOARD THAT WE DON'T THINK THAT'S AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO LIMIT US. IN THE END R. BOARD HAS CHOSEN TO THEN RESEARCH IT. THEY HAVE NOT BECAUSE AGAIN MOST OF THE DIVESTITURE HAVE BEEN FAIRLY FINITE AND IN MATERIAL. OUR BOARD HAS CHOSEN NOT TO TO PULL UP THAT FIDUCIARY FLAG AND SAYING NO. BUT I WOULD HAVE SAY WERE ACTUALLY GETTING VERY CLOSE TO THAT AND SOME OF THE DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE COMING OUT. WELL YOUR REPORT SHOWS THAT. BEEN LOSERS SO FAR RIGHT FELLOW THERE BEEN I'VE BEEN APART OF FIVE DIVEST AND STIRS DONE SIX OVERALL AND RIGHT NOW ALL OF THEM ARE. PRODUCING NEGATIVE RESULTS WERE UNDERPERFORMING DUE TO THAT WE COULD. SO. DO YOU PROVIDE. A COMPARISON TO LET'S SAY THE FORTUNE ONE HUNDRED. DB PLANTS IF THEY'RE STILL ANNIE. AND THEIR PERFORMANCE SAY THE ANNUAL RATE OF RETURN SAY AN AVERAGE. COMPARED TO YOUR GREATER RETURN AND THE CALPERS WRITER TRAIN SO WE CAN. SHOW THAT YOU ARE TRENDING WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR. AND THEREFORE IF YOU'RE DOING BETTER THAN YOU'RE ADDING VALUE TO THE TAXPAYERS IF YOU'RE DOING. IF YOU'RE BELOW THE AVERAGE AND THEN MAYBE WE HAVE AN EXPLANATION. I'M. IT'S S. CENTER MORE LIKE KNOWS IT INVESTMENTS A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE FIELD SO WE HAVE THOSE COMPARISONS TO US TO PRIVATE SECTOR US THE PUBLIC SECTOR LARGE SMALL AND EVEN NINE U. S. PLANTS. ASSET ALLOCATION IS THE BIGGEST DETERMINANT OR WHETHER WE'RE SUCCEEDING OR NOT. AND IT'S REALLY HARD TO DIS AGGREGATE THAT WHAT'S CAUSING THE OUTPERFORMANCE R. UNDER PERFORMANCE BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT IN OUR CASE OF OUR PORTFOLIO WE'VE BEEN TOP QUARTILE OVER. THREE FIVE AND TWENTY YEARS ARM UP RELATIVE TO PUBLIC PENSION PLANS TO HAVE A LOOK TO CORPORATE LATELY BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM ONTO A LIABILITY TO. PORTFOLIO SO THEY WOULD BE UNDER PERFORM. THOUGH IS THAT WE DO MEASURE TRY AND SHOW WHETHER WE'RE ADDING VALUE. PUBLISHED YES. SO YOU COULD. WHAT OUT THERE ON THE WEBSITE PROVIDE THAT? THE BIG ISSUE NOW OF COURSE IS R. UNFUNDED LIABILITIES AND SO NOW YOU'VE GOT YOUR PLANTS BY SAYING. THEY WERE HAVING DIFFICULT WERE. WE'RE WE'RE BRICK WORD ACTUALLY. COUNTING THE MONTHS. WHEN WE RUN OUT OF CASH SO THAT YOUR PRESSURE. YEAH BUT YOU'RE STILL. MANAGING. PER VALUE AND YOUR FOCUS IS STILL JUST TO DO THE BEST YOU CAN WITH THE RESOURCES YOU HAVE. REGARDLESS OF THE OUTSIDE PRESSURES. IT IS AN OUR REQUEST IS DON'T NARROW OUR UNIVERSE DON'T LIMIT OUR OPPORTUNITY SET ALLOW US TO MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO WE'RE INTEGRATING THESE VALUES WE THINK IN THE WAY WE'RE INVESTING IN AND. TRYING TO GET THE MAX RARE RETURN AT APPROVED LEVEL OF RISK AND AT THE LOWEST COST POSSIBLE. THE COMPUTER. GUARANTEES. BUT QUESTION TALK ABOUT. THE BUILDINGS OF DOLLARS ㍹ IN THESE PREVIOUS DIVESTMENT BILLS BUT ALSO WAS THE COSTS ASSOCIATED RIGHT TO THOSE ALSO CAUSES SO SHOULD OWN GUARDED AYE VAST. HOW DOES THAT WORK ON HOW MUCH LOSS OF THAT AS WELL? YEAH THEIR TRANSACTION COSTS WHEN WE SELL WE WE TRIED TO BE EXTREMELY EFFICIENT MY EXAMPLE TO TO YOU OF THE MEMBER IN YOUR DISTRICT THAT'S NOT HAPPY THEY'RE NOT GONNA THROW THEIR HOUSE ON THE MARKET AND HURT THEM SELVES. SO WERE LIKEWISE OUR FIDUCIARY SONIC IMAGES DUMP THE SHARES ON THE MARKET WE'RE GONNA SELL THEM AS EFFICIENTLY. THAT DOES CREATE TRANSACTION COST AND THEN WE HAVE TO REDEPLOY THAT CAPITAL WE ALSO HAVE TO PAY A LOT OF EXTRA FEES TO PEOPLE THE BILE THE SPECIALTY INDEXES AND MEASUREMENTS. SOME OF THE BOOK OF THE BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED HAVE HAVE LIKE THE SUDAN BILL THE RANDALL. AB GEOPOLITICAL ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO HIRE OUTSIDE EXPERTS TO REALLY TELL US. WHAT IF THE FRENCH OIL COMPANY AND WHAT ARE THEY DOING IN SUDAN WHAT IS A CHINESE OIL COMPANY R. INDONESIAN MANUFACTURED DOING IN SUDAN BECAUSE WE'RE NOT THERE? SO WE HAVE ADDED RESEARCH COSTS AND ADDED INDEX BECAUSE. THOSE ARE SOME MUCH SMALLER THAN THE OVERALL DOLLAR LOSS OF THE OF THE EXCLUDING THOSE SECURITIES. SO. THOUGH I THINK IT'S SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS. SO WHERE THINGS THAT'S COME UP IS COURSE AYE AYE AYE I'D. MY GUESS IS IS THAT. MIKE MAY MY COLLEAGUES WILL NOT STOP WRITING R. DON'T BE STAKEHOLDERS WHO WON'T TALK ABOUT THE BEST MEN AND WHAT CERTAINLY I THINK ON ONE LEVEL AND THE NOSE COMMENTED WELL THE VESTMENT ISN'T VERY EFFECTIVE BUT PEOPLE POINT TO EXAMPLES LIKE APARTHEID SOUTH AFRICA WHERE TEAMS LIKE THE VESTMENT. WAS WHAT DROVE FINALLY DROVE. SAID THE GOVERNMENT TO FINALLY YELLED. THAT DERIVE APARTHEID TELLING PEOPLE I THAT. WE CAN THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS BUT. OKAY WELL ANYWAY DOES APPEAL TALK ABOUT. THAT AS WELL AND I THINK. I'M NOT SURE WE CAN JUST SIMPLY SAY DIVESTMENT OVERALL DOESN'T DO ANYTHING I MEAN. I AM NOT SURE THAT'S A REALISTIC. ARGUMENTS MAKE AYE THINKING TALK ABOUT HOW EFFECTIVE IT IS AND THEN WE'LL AND AND ALTERNATIVES TO THAT. BUT. MY QUESTION IS THAT WHEN ARM BUT PEOPLE DO COME UP AND THEY HAVE RELIGION IT REASONS FOR SAYING ALL WHY IS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA INVOLVED IN. SUCH AND SUCH OR SUCH THOSE WHATEVER. IT WAS A POLICY COMMITTEE ARE ARE POLICY COMMITTEES ON THE BOTH HOUSES AND WE HVE TO. DEAL IT RIGHT WE HAVE AND SO FORTH. IS I WOULD ASK EACH OF YOU ARM IS. IS YOUR ARE YOUR RESPECTIVE ORGANIZATIONS ABLE TO WE SAID OKAY WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AN AND OUR ANALYSIS THE BILL TO RECOGNIZE THE POTENTIAL COST TO BE ABLE TO. HELP YOU DO AN ANALYSIS OR HELP PROVIDE HOUSE BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE NUMBERS AND YOU ACTUALLY HAVE THE CAPACITY OR WORK WITH THAT SOME PEOPLE MAY ARGUE THAT WELL. YOU MIGHT BE BIASED READY SO WILL HAVE AN OUTSIDE ANOTHER AND TO TO YOU WILL DO IT BUT THEN PROVIDE THE KIND OF DATA SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY HAVE IT THAT KIND OF ANALYSIS. WHAT BEFORE BILL COMES UP SO WE CAN HAVE THAT AS PART THE DISCUSSION I FEEL LIKE THAT THAT'S? UNFORTUNATELY NOT AS PROMINENT OF A PART OF THE DISCUSSION WE HAVE OUR HEARINGS ABOUT THESE DIVESTMENT DOES IT COULD BE. SETTLE AYE SO I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT EACH OF YOUR SYSEMS COULD COMMIT YOU TO HELPING US PER DAY. CONDUCT THAT TYPE OF ANALYSIS I THINK I THINK THE CURRENT SPEED BUMP OF FOR THE FISCAL ANALYSIS IS ISN'T HIGH ENOUGH. GIVEN THE GRAVITY THESE BILLS A YOU KNOW MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS A SOMEONE COOLEY KNOWS FROM THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY I WHEN I WAS INSURANCE COMMISSIONER COLORADO. I AM IN INSURANCE WORLD YOU OFTEN HAVE MANDATED BENEFIT BILLS COME TO CAPITALS AND THEY'RE ALWAYS EMOTIONAL LIKE THESE ISSUES ARE THE ADVOCATES FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT THESE ISSUES SO. IT'S HARD TO GET A GOOD CONVERSATION AROUND THE FACTS AND FIGURES AROUND THIS IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY OVER TWENTY SIX STATES AND EIGHT OZ STATE LEGISLATURES HAVE MANDATED BENEFIT REVIEW LAWS. ACQUIRING EXTRAORDINARY PROCESSES AROUND LOOKING INSURANCE MANDATES JUST TO MAKE SURE IT'S DONE IN A TECHNICAL WAY AN OBJECTIVE WAY ON THAT THERE'S. A PAYMENT OF REAL OF A REAL PARTY DOING IT SO THAT IS A THOROUGH ANALYSIS. WHEN I WAS INSURANCE COMMISSIONER BEYOND. BILLS THAT ARE AGAINST SO DIFFICULT AROUND AUTISM IN THOSE THINGS IT REALLY BRING MOTIONS THE TABLE AND I THINK THAT INDEPENDENT OFFICE HELPS A LOT SO I THINK EXTENT. A PROCESS COULD BE SHAPE HERE THAT RESEMBLES THAT I THINK THEY'LL BE VERY EFFECTIVE THOUGH AND KNOW THAT THE FORGIVENESS DIVERSOS R. COMMITMENT FROM CAL STIRS THAN TO HELP US DO THAT I WOULD GLADLY DO LIVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH THAT ISSUE. FIRST YES. YES OR NO ANSWERS YES WE'RE HAPPY TO ENGAGE. AB AND I THINK HOPE WILL HOPEFULLY WHAT YOU'VE SEEN TODAY AND WILL CONTINUE ON THE FOURTH PANEL IS MORE OF AN ALIGNMENT OF INTERESTS BETWEEN. THE MEMBER GROUPS AND THE EMPLOYER GROUPS AND THE PENSION FUNDS AROUND THIS TOPIC SO TRANSPARENCY ENGAGEMENT. ABSOLUTELY OKAY NOW APPRECIATE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW IN ORDER TO GET THAT KIND ANALYSIS WE KIND OF NEED DATA THAT YOU'RE READY HOLD SO THAT'S BRING PORN. AYE SIR LEYVA. THINK CENTER PAN OF REALLY APPRECIABLE APPRECIATE ALL OF YOU BEING HERE AND WHAT YOU DO FOR US EVERY DAY. I JUST WANTED TO A COUPLE COMMENTS AND THEN A BALLOT QUESTION. I SIT ON A PRIVATE TRUST FUND FOR TWELVE YEARS AND THE CONCERNS EXACTLY THE SAME ONE MY BENEFIT BE PAID AND THEN THE OTHER SIDE IS CAN I AFFORD TO MAKE THOSE PAYMENTS. I DO THINK THAT MANY TIMES AYE VESTMENTS ARE LARGELY SYMBOLIC AND COMING OUT OF THE LABOR MOVEMENT I LIKE A GOOD FIGHT AS MUCH AS ANYBODY ELSE WANNA MAKE SURE THAT FIGHT ACTUALLY TRANSLATES INTO SOMETHING THAT HELPS FOLKS. THE FUND IS CURRENTLY AT SIXTY EIGHT PERCENT IS UP WITH THE FUNDING CRITICAL STATUS. SO IT IT'S REALLY A POINT IN TIME. A CERTAIN SO IT'S THE THAT THE NUMBER OF ASSETS WE HAVE COMPARE. AND WE NEED TO. ANNUAL BASIS SO WE THERE IS A PATH TO MOVE TOWARD FULL FUNDING IT'S SAID TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE YEAR PATH AND IN THAT TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE YEARS THE RISKS THAT WE HAVE IS SURVIVING THE MARKET VOLATILITY. THE ONE AREA THAT WE ARE VERY MINDFUL OF. OR THE NUMBER THAT WERE VERY MINDFUL OF IS NOT HAVING THAT FUNDED STATUS DROPPED TO AROUND THE FIFTY PERCENT MARK THAT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR A SYSTEM OF OUR SIZE SCALE TO RECOVER FROM. SO THAT'S A RISK FACTOR BUT AT SOME POINT IN TIME WITH THE PLAN MOVING FORWARD THAT PLAN JUST HAPPENS TO BE. AND YOU FIT IT I DO UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE LONG TERM WHEN YOU SEE THOSE SHORT TERM RETURNS AND THEY'RE VERY SCARY AND YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER LONG TERM. BUT DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU ARE ON A PATH TO GET THE PLAN TO SEVENTY TO SEVENTY FIVE TO EIGHTY PERCENT FULLY FUNDED. WE DO BELIEVE FOR ON A PATH IN THERE THERE'D BEEN SOME DECISIONS MADE BY THIS BODY IN THE GOVERNOR THAT THE SIX BILLION DOLLAR PAYMENT TO HELP PAY DOWN THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL BUT. IT'S CONVERTED US FROM A NEGATIVE CASH FLOW POSITION TO A POSITIVE CASH FLOW POSITION FOR THIS ENTIRE YEAR IT'S VERY HELPFUL WERE NOT SELLING ASSETS THE PAY BENEFITS. I AM BUT AGAIN THAT PEPPER. IT PEPPERMINT USE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE FOND OF PEPPER OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY CRITICAL OF HAVE BROUGHT. HAVE BRAT THAT TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE YEAR MARK WHEN PEPPER MEMBERS BEGIN TO RETIRE YOU ACTUALLY SEE THE LIABILITIES COME DOWN PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY SO. YES I DO BELIEVE WE'RE ON THE RIGHT PATH THERE ARE MORE A DECISION. TO BE MADE AND WE'RE WORKING WITH OLIVER STAKEHOLDERS ON WHAT THOSE MIGHT BE BUT IN DECEMBER THE BOARD ADOPTED THE NEXT FOR YOUR ASSET ALLOCATION AND AND THE DISCOUNT RATE WAS THREE. CONFIRM TO DROP DOWN TO SEVEN EXCELLENT THANK YOU. THE MORE COOLEY. WELL I'M JUST TO CLOSE OUT THE LEGAL CONVERSATION. WHEN THE VOTERS ADOPTED THE ARRESTS A STANDARD PRUDENT EXPERT AND AND EIGHTY FOUR. HAD THE VOTERS LOOKED AT THEIR VOTER GUIDE AND ACTUALLY READ THE LANGUAGE OF THE NEW SECTION SEVENTEEN. THE FINAL PROVISION NAY RED IS DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO THIS CONVERSATION IN THE RELEVANT YARDSTICK. THE. RETIREMENT BOARD OF THE PUBLIC PENSION OR TERMS SYSTEM. SHALL DIVERSIFIED INVESTMENT OF THE SYSTEM. TO MINIMIZE THE RISK OF LOS AND MAXIMIZE RATE RETURN. UNLESS. UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES CLEARLY PROVED NOT TO DO SO. SO I THINK THIS CONVERSATION ALWAYS COMES BACK THAT PRUDENT STANDARD. BUT IT DOES SET UP THE ARTISTIC IS. YOU KNOW OUR THINGS HAPPENING R. WE GET INTO A TIPPING POINT WITH RESPECT TO A CERTAIN TYPE OF INVESTMENT. THERE IS LOOKING LIKE IT ACTUALLY MAY BE PRUDENT TO DIVEST. AND AT THAT POINT IF YOU THINK THAT'S THE WAY THINGS ARE CUTTING THAT'S ACTUALLY VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION IS BETTER. TO DIVEST EARLY BEFORE THE WHOLE THING. GOES INTO THE CAN. LOVE BUT I THINK EVEN THE VOTERS HAD THIS. THING IN FRONT OF THEM THIS IDEA WE GONNA YOU'RE GONNA DIVERSIFY SOMETIMES IS CLEARLY PRUDENT TO. STEPANEK FOR DIRECTION. WELL I A Y. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS WE LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS IS THE SERVICE THEY JUST THE. AND OTHER STAFFERS WERE MOVING FORWARD. AS WE LOOK AT THIS ISSUE I I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW. WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE U. PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITIES AND I THINK THAT. WHAT PART OF WHAT WE WANT TRY TO GET TOWARD IS REALLY BUILDING THAT CONSENSUS IS HEARINGS PART OF THAT BUILDING THAT CONSENSUS ABOUT HOW WE MOVE? FORD BECAUSE IT'S GETTING THERE ARE MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS YOUR PUBLIC PENSION FUNDS WERE LEGISLATURE WE HAVE VOTERS WE HAVE STAKEHOLDERS. PEOPLE FIFTH STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS AND. I OFTEN HOW THIS THAT CONVERSATION WHEN IT STARTS AND INTERSECTING WITH WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO BE SURE WE PROTECT THE EVERITT. RETIREMENT. OF THE OF OUR EMPLOYEES AND AND RETIREES NOW HOW DO WE HAVE THAT CONVERSATION A WAY THAT RECOGNIZES. WITH WATER PRIORITIES ARE AND DO IT IN A WAY THAT WE'RE NOT PLAYING BRIDGE WHEN I HAVE A BRINKMANSHIP CONTEST IT'S REALLY ABOUT HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD AND DO IT TRANSPARENTLY NOW WE REALLY CONSIDERING ALL THE DIFFERENT ISSUES. THAT ARE INVOLVED IN TRYING IT AND WE TALK ABOUT TRANSPARENCY AS PART OF ITS BE SURE THAT ALL THE SECTIONS LIKE LIKE WHAT IS THE. TRUE COST OF DOING THIS WHAT IS THE ALTERNATIVES RIGHT ENGAGEMENT SO FORTH WHAT'S THE MOST EFFECTIVE RIGHT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT. WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THERE'S A PROBLEM THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS AND WITH PLEASE DIVEST FROM THIS DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT PROBLEM AND WE DON'T DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT I THINK THAT'S THAT THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND RIGHT. AND SO WHAT CAN WE DO TO MOVE FORWARD TO WORK EFFECTIVELY. AND THAT ALSO TO RECOGNIZE THAT IF SOMEONE IS DEAD SET ON THE VESTMENT KNOW WHAT IS THE COST AND HOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE UP FOR THAT. RIGHT I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S IT'S AT AND AND THAT COST IS OFTEN NOT BORNE BY THE TARGET OF THE DIVESTMENT THAT'S THAT'S YOU TRY TO GO AFTER YEAR YOU'RE HURTING OTHER PEOPLE AND. AND SO IF THAT HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE THAT. THANK YOU. THEN SIR I APPRECIATE THAT THOSE MENTIONED AYE S. YOU IN THIS ABOUT. WE WE ARE GONNA TALK ABOUT HER OWN REVIEW. THAT WE DON'T HEALTH INSURANCE SO I WANT THAT WELCOME KAREN CORBETT HIS THAT DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA HEALTH BENEFITS REVIEW PROGRAM. TO. NOT GOING TO A LOT THINK ABOUT HOW WE DO THE REVIEW BUT MAYBE YOU CAN COMMENTS MORE SPECIFICALLY ON THIS WERE OFFICIALLY RUNNING OUT TIME BUT. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT LIKE WHAT IMPACT DO YOU THINK THIS REVIEW PROCESS HAS HAD ON. BUT NOT A POLICY MAKING BY PRECIADO JACK'S COMMENTS ABOUT BENEFIT REVIEW PROGRAMS I WISHED I HAD HAD THAT ON YOU TUBE LIKE A PLAY THAT BUT I. SO AS AGAIN I THINK I'LL PROVIDE A VERY QUICK. FOR REVIEW OF CHIPPER WITH AN EMPHASIS ON LESSONS LEARNED. PERHAPS SOME OF THE IMPACTS AS WELL SO REPLICABLE ELEMENTS OF CHU BURPS APPROACH THAT MIGHT BE APPLIED FOR OTHER AREAS IN NEED OF OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE BASED ANALYSIS. IN A PROVIDING VERY HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW. BACKGROUND OF CHIPPER AND I PROMISE VERY HIGH LEVEL FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE READ CHIPPER REPORTS AND TEY CAN BE WAITING SO I'M NOT GONNA REPLICATE THAT. I'M THEN I'M GONNA ZERO IN ON SOME KEY ELEMENTS THAT I BELIEVE HAVE HELPED US OVER THE YEARS. UP AND. THAT YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE SORT OF FOR BUCKETS ON TRANSPARENCY AND THE IMPORTANCE OF RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE LEGISLATURE. YOU DESCRIBE LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF THE INTERACTIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE. AND THE REQUEST PROCESS. I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND LOOKING AT THE HISTORY OF TO BURP WHICH HAS NOW ALMOST FIFTEEN YEARS. THAT JR PURPOSE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE LEGISLATURE BUT A POLICE. I THINK THAT'S A REALLY AND EXTINCTION. I'M GONNA SPIEGEL ABOUT ABOUT THE VALUE OF HAVING MULTI DISCIPLINARY CONTRIBUTORS ALL OF SPECIALIZED ON THEIR DIFFICULT. TO ASSASSIN AN OBJECTIVE R. IMPARTIAL WAY IT REQUIRES THE BEST REVIEW OF EVIDENCE POSSIBLE. I'M SURE BURKE HAS AN ADVISORY BOARD THAT HAS HELPED TO DEVELOP METHODS. AND REVIEW REPORT SENATE'S ALSO I'VE BEEN IN ADDITIONAL SORT OF FIRE WALL OF OF ON DEMONSTRATING INTEGRITY OF TRUE PURPOSE PROCESS. IN THE SPEAK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF DEVELOPING A ROBUST AND. RIGOROUS METHODOLOGY. TO DO THE WORK SO THAT IT IS SEEN AS CREDIBLE AND A HANDFUL OF LESSONS LEARNED. THE BY WAY A VERY QUICK BACKGROUND. AGAIN CHIPPER WAS ESTABLISHED ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO OF BY STATUTE IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO. IT'S BEEN REAUTHORIZED SEVERAL TIMES SINCE THEN I THINK IT'S BEEN SEEN AS A WELL RESPECTED. SOURCE OF INFORMATION FOR THE LEGISLATURE. BOTH BY REGULAR PROPONENTS AND ARE ADVOCATES OF CERTAIN. BENEFIT MANDATE BILLS AS WELL AS OPPONENTS. OF HEALTH INSURANCE BENEFIT BILLS. THE POLICY COMMITTEES APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEES AND LEADERSHIP. OF BOTH HOUSES ARE THAT ARE THOSE EMPOWERED BY STATUTE TO REQUEST YOUR BURP ANALYSES THE NOT INDIVIDUAL BILL AUTHORS WHO ARE THINKING ABOUT A SUBJECT THAT'S BAD ALSO IS A IMPORTANT DISTINCTION. OB SUBURBANS CURRENTLY AUTHORIZED UNTIL JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY. WERE HOUSED WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THROUGH WERE ABLE TO ACCESS FACULTY AND RESEARCHERS FROM ACROSS CAMPUSES BUT WERE INSTITUTIONAL INDEPENDENT. THE TROOPER SPEAKS ONLY FOR ITSELF. THROUGH THE USE OF PRE CONTRACTED FACULTY IN ACTUARIES WE WE SECURE ON PIECES OF TIME. FROM FOLKS. MORE THAN A YEAR IN ADVANCE. WERE ABLE BY AS WELL AS A VERY TERRIBLE CONFLICT OF INTERESTS SCREENING PROCESS. ROOM WERE LOOKING AT WHERE FACULTY AND RESEARCHERS HAVE GOTTEN THEIR FUNDING SOURCES TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NO POTENTIAL OR PERCEIVED CONFLICTS OF A CONFLICT OF INTEREST. WE USE THE NIH R. STANDARDS IN OUR OWN REVIEW. ON YOUR PURPOSE ABLE TO PRODUCE WITHIN SIXTY DAYS LAST YEAR WAS AN AVERAGE OF FIFTY. RIGOROUS DATA DRIVEN ANALYSES OF INTRODUCED FOUND BILLS. WE DO NOT KNOW IN ADVANCE WHAT TOPICS WE WILL SEE SO WORD JUST AS EAGER. CHECKING. YOU KNOW A LEGEND FOLLOW UP UNTIL MIDNIGHT. AND SOMETIMES LATER. ON FEBRUARY SIXTEENTH SO IT'S ALL IT THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF A VERY EXCITING TIME OF YEAR OUT FOR US ALL. AND WE ALSO DON'T KNOW HOW MANY ANALYSIS REQUEST WE WILL SEE. AND RECEIVE. AND THE REQUEST OF COURSE GIVEN THE CYCLE. TYPICALLY FALL CONCURRENTLY SO IT'S A BIG PUSH ON BETWEEN NOW AND MAY. THE COST FOR JR PURPOSE ROUGHLY TWO MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR TO PRODUCE APPROXIMATELY A DOZEN. ANALYSES ARE IMPORTANT DISTINCTION ABOUT CHIPPER THESE ARE NOT GENERAL FUND DOLLARS THAT SUPPORT OUR WORK RATHER THE LEGISLATURE FUNDS EUROPE'S WORK THROUGH AN ANNUAL ASSESSMENT. ON HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS IN CALIFORNIA. I'M KEY TO OUR APPROACH INTO OUR WORK IS THE DEVELOPMENT AND ONGOING MAINTENANCE OF AN ACTUARIAL MODEL OF HEALTH INSURANCE IN CALIFORNIA. A MODEL THAT MUST BE ANNUALLY UPDATED TO ACCOMMODATE CHANGES THAT ARE LARGE LIKE WHEN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT COMMENDABLE PLAY IN REALLY ALTERED OF THE WEIGHT AND HEALTH INSURANCES. FUNDED AND AND PROVIDED IN CALIFORNIA OF COURSE BROUGHT MANY PEOPLE UNDER THE COVERAGE TEN. AS WELL SMALLER CHANGES THAT ARE ONGOING CHANGES IN UTILIZATION PATTERNS. ENROLLMENT TRENDS MORE EMPLOYERS GOING TO SELF INSURED. DRUGS IN AND SO FORTH. SO THAT'S THE VERY HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW ANOTHER JUMP INTO TRANSPARENCY CREDIBILITY AND THE IMPORTANCE OF RELATIONSHIPS IN OUR WORK. WOULD UNDERSCORE THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF RELATIONSHIPS AND CREDIBILITY HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO WIN AND MAINTAIN THE TRUST OF THE LEGISLATURE SPONSORS ARE AND MANY OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ENGAGED IN THE TOPICS OF HEALTH INSURANCE. IT AS AS BEEN NOTED EARLIER THESE ARE. IMPORTANT TOPICS THERE EMOTIONALLY CHARGED I'M SOMETIMES THE EVIDENCE ISN'T SO CLEAR CUT. TRAVERSED STAFF ANNUALLY MEETS AYE WITH MORE THAN THIRTY THIRTY FIVE STAKEHOLDERS. DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS TO ALLOW FOR FEEDBACK QUESTIONS COMMENTS ON NOW AND BE BACK ON OUR PROCESSES IN OUR REPORTS. ARE WE CONDUCT AN ANNUAL A LEGISLATIVE BRIEFING WE HAVE ONE COMING UP ON FEBRUARY SEVENTH I THINK IN THIS ROOM. ARM WE ALSO BRIEF SPONSORS BILL AUTHORS AND THE COMMITTEES OF OUR FINDINGS. AND ANSWER ANY AND ALL QUESTIONS WE ATTEND EVERY HEARING IF WE ARE NEEDED TO COMMENT OR ANSWER QUESTIONS. I'VE BEEN DIRECTOR FOR ABOUT A SIX AND A HALF YEARS IT HAPPENED THREE TIMES BUT. YOU KNOW WHERE THEIR. AND I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE PROCESS. I'M KEY TO THE CREDIBILITY AND I THINK WIDESPREAD USE OF OUR WORK BY BOTH SIDES. OF A GIVEN ISSUE IS ARE KNOWN WELL KNOWN AND ESTABLISHED NEUTRALITY I REALLY THINK THAT'S A VERY VERY KEY PIECE. YOUR BURKE MAKES NO RECOMMENDATIONS WE ACT TRANSPARENTLY AND WE'RE OPEN TO RECEIVING DATA FROM ALL INVOLVED PARTIES WE HAVE A A PROCESS WHEN WE GET A REQUEST. AND WE ALLOW PUBLIC INPUT OF. ANY. BACKGROUNDS ARTICLES OR LETTERS THAT PEOPLE WISH TO PROVIDE. ALL OF OUR METHODS R. DATACENTER LITERATURE SOURCES ARE WELL CITED AND AVAILABLE TO ALL ON OUR WEBSITE. HAVING A RIGOROUSLY NEUTRAL AN ACADEMICALLY BASED REVIEW PROCESS ALLOWS OPPONENTS IN ADVOCATES DO AGREE THAT THE BILL IS LIKELY TO DO ACTS AND WHY. AS YOU ALL HAVE NO DOUBT EXPERIENCE THAT IS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO ACCOMPLISH SUCH BASIC AGREEMENT I BELIEVE ALLOWS THE LEGISLATURE TO. TO FOCUS ON WHETHER SUCH OUTCOMES MAY BE WORTH THE COST. IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS INDEPENDENCE AND NONPARTISAN STRUCTURE. ARE THE KEY INGREDIENTS I THINK FOR CREATING A DURABLE AND LASTING PROGRAM ON ANY TOPIC. BRIEFLY ON ON METHODS TO TO ACCOMPLISH THE ANALYSIS WORK THAT TROOPER RECEIVES YOUR PURPOSE BUILT ON AGAIN THIS A ROBUST AND COMPLEX ACTUARIAL MODEL THAT REFLECTS THE INTRICACIES OF CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETS. THIS MODEL WHICH IS TAKEN YEARS TO DEVELOP AND REFINE THIS ESSENTIAL TO PREDICT IN INCREMENTAL IMPACTS A PIECE OF LEGISLATION WOULD HAVE. ALL AND UTILIZATION HEALTH OUTCOMES PREMIUMS ARM AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS SUCH AS IMPACTS ON MEDICAL. AND CALPERS. ARE NOT ALL THINGS IN MEDICINE ARE AFFECTED HER SAVE AND SOME MAY BE INDEED HARMFUL NOT ALL THINGS HAVE BEEN STUDIED EXTENSIVELY. OUR TEAM COMBED THROUGH HUNDREDS OF ARTICLES AND DATA SOURCES PROVIDES THE LEGISLATURE WITH THE MOST CUTTING EDGE ASSESSMENT OF THE MEDICAL EVIDENCE. AND HOW STRONG IT MAY BE OR MAY NOT BE ON IN ORDER TO PROJECT A PROJECT. DEBT I'M IMPACTS ON HEALTH OUTCOMES. OUR PUBLIC HEALTH TEAM THEN EXAMINES PREVALENCE DISPARITIES AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND HOW CALIFORNIANS COULD BE IMPACTED. AND WHETHER ANY POTENTIAL BENEFITS MAY MITIGATE SOME OF THE COSTA PROPOSED LEGISLATION. I'M JUST A HANDFUL OF LESSONS LEARNED TORTURE BURP LIKE PROGRAM WORK CREATED COULD LEVERAGE MANY THE PROCESS SEIZE AND LESSONS LEARNED BY CHIPPER. YOU'RE BURPED AGAIN I MENTION BRIEFLY THE USE OF AN ADVISORY BOARD OF OUTSIDE EXPERTS IN OURS INCLUDES EXPERTS I'M REPRESENTING ARRAY OF HEALTH CARE INTEREST ALL OF WHOM RESIDE OUTSIDE A CALIFORNIA. THINKING ABOUT THIS TOPIC POTENTIALLY A SIMILAR TYPE OF STRUCTURE BUT PERHAPS REPRESENTING ECONOMIST FINANCE SOCIAL POLICY. ANALYST AND ADVOCATES MIGHT BE FROM WITHIN CALIFORNIA COULD BE A REALLY STRONG SOUNDING BOARD FOR DEVELOPING ROBUST. ACCEPTED AND BALANCE METHODOLOGIES. THE TIMELINE FOR DOING THIS WORK ALONG WITH THE COURSE THE NUMBER AND COMPLEXITY OF REQUEST WOULD HAVE A REAL IMPACT ON THE OPERATING COST. OF SUCH AN EFFORT. HAVING TO RESERVE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF TIME IN A FAST AND FURIOUS TIME SCHEDULE MEANS RESEARCHERS AND FACULTY CENTER BURP HAVE TO DROP OTHER WORK IN OTHER OPPORTUNITIES. THE MORE PREDICTABLE THE TIME TABLE SAY EVERY OTHER YEAR. BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND YEAR PROCESSION BETWEEN AUGUST AND DECEMBER. SUCH A MODEL MIGHT ALLOW FOR MORE FLEXIBLE STAFFING USE IN THE USE OF EXPERTS WHICH COULD HELP. REDUCE COST. ROBERT LEVERAGES UC'S EXPERTS TO QUICKLY IDENTIFY AND WORK WITH CONTENT EXPERTS ESPECIALLY WHEN LITERATURE OR DATA IS IN SHORT SUPPLY. A SIMILAR MODEL I THINK COULD BE EMPLOYED. SETTING UP A PROGRAM LIKE THIS REQUIRES A FAIR AMOUNT OF WORK AND INVESTMENT ENSURING THAT A PROGRAM IS RESPONSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE IS CRITICAL BUT SO IS IN MY VIEW AND EXPERIENCE BEEN INSULATED TO DO THIS IMPORTANT WORK. IN CLOSING FOR OVER A DECADE THE HEALTH IN APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEES HAVE MADE GOOD USE OF CHIPPER AS A RESOURCE TO SUPPORT THE LEGISLATURE'S DECISION MAKING. RAMADAS COST I THINK ANOTHER ACADEMICALLY BASED PROGRAM DESIGN WITH SIMILAR PROTECTIONS FROM THE ROUGH AND TUMBLE ASPECTS THE POLITICAL WORLD MIGHT WELL BE A CREATIVE AND RIGOROUS SUPPORT. FOR CONDUCTING ADDITIONAL POLICY ANALYSIS OBJECTIVES ANOTHER ENOUGH. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH QUESTIONS ARE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ALRIGHT NO THANK YOU SO MUCH ACTION LOOKING FOR OPENHEALTH COMMITTEE WILL BE LOOKING AT TO PURPOSES SO AND YOU AND I. THE FORMER UC FACULTY MEMBER AND HAS HAD A CHANCE TO INTERACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE AS WELL AND I THINK IT'S THAT APPRECIATE THAT THE PRESENTATION. AND YOU BREAKING INTO MUCH. ALRIGHT WELL WE ARE COMING CLOSE TO OUR TO THE. THEY WILL GET KICKED OUT HERE BUT. WE DO WANNA NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENTS AND I'M GONNA ASK YOU CAN TRY TO KEEP IT UNDER A MINUTE BUT YOU'VE OF COURSE PEOPLE IS FREE TO SUPPLY OF WRITTEN COMMENTS AS WELL AS THEY WISH. SO I WANT JUST THAT THE MICROPHONE THERE I JUST INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND THAT IF YOU REPRESENTING ANYONE AND. WHAT YOU WHAT YOU THINK IT CAN? BE A CHAIR. THE CHIRS AND MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEES. DON'T GIVE IS WITH THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION. WE REPRESENT THE FIRE DISTRICT WATER DISTRICTS UTILITY DISTRICTS UP AND DOWN THE STATE AMONGST OTHER DISTRICTS WE HAVE OVER NINETY THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MOST OF WHICH WERE RECEIVING A DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION. A I'M GONNA CUT THROUGH MOST OF MY. TALKING POINTS BECAUSE HE WAS OR HE SAID. DIVESTMENT IT AT CAUSES LOSS OF THE FUND LAWSUIT FUND THESE BE MADE UP BY CONTRIBUTIONS. FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS COME FROM TYPICALLY CUTS TO SERVICES THAT THE FOLKS ARE RECEIVING. AND SO AS A RESULT CST AID. AT THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION DEVELOPED POLICY PRINCIPLE ON CALPERS INVESTMENT. WE WANT ENCOURAGE. YOUR COMMITTEES TO DO THE SAME SO WANT TO READ THIS REAL QUICK AND AND THEN MOVE ON. A. DEFENSEMAN IS AN INVESTMENT STRATEGY CAN PRESENT CHALLENGING CONFLICTS WERE CALPERS IMBALANCE IN CURRENT AFFAIRS AGAINST ITS FIDUCIARY DUTY TO MAXIMIZE RETIREMENT INVESTMENTS. CSTA SUPPORTS CALPERS PRIORITY TO ITS MEMBERS IS STATED THEY COULDN'T STAY CONSTITUTION ARTICLE SIXTEEN SECTION SEVENTEEN RETIREMENT BOARD'S DUTIES TO ITS PARTICIPANTS AND THEIR BENEFICIARIES SHOULD TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER ANY OTHER DUTY. THE FDA POSES ANY EFFORT. THAT WOULD DIVERT CALPERS FROM ITS DUTY TO ITS MEMBERS INCLUDING DIVEST OF CALPERS ASSETS TO ACHIEVE POLITICAL OBJECTIVES. IF THAT INVESTMENT WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE OVERALL HEALTH OF THE FUND. CST SUPPORTS IT CALPERS PROXY ACCESS EFFORTS TO AFFECT CHANGE FROM WITHIN BUSINESS CALPERS HAS INVESTED IN TO ENSURE THEY ARE ALL WELL MANAGED FOR SUSTAINED LONG TERM SUCCESS. AND I THINK THAT'S EVIDENT THROUGH THE EXXON EFFORTS AND THE DAKOTA PIPELINE THAT THEY CALPERS UNDERTOOK LAST YEAR. US WITH THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME APPRECIATE YOU HAVE HOLDING THIS HEARING. THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH. WELCOME JIM VOSS BIT FROM PHILOSOPHY CALIFORNIA I AM A CT A MEMBER AND I AM ALSO A MEMBER OF CAO STIRS. THE FIRST DOMINO HAS FALLEN THE STATE OF NEW YORK IS TAKEN A LEADERSHIP ROLE TO PROTECT ITS STATE EMPLOYEE RETIREES BUT PLANNING TO DIVEST NEW YORK STATE COMMON RETIREMENT FUND.

ITS FUNDS FROM FOSSIL FUELS BUT IT IS ALSO SUING ME FOR POSSIBLE COMPANIES. TO BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO RECOUP. MONEY SPENT FOR RESILIENCY EFFORTS FROM CLIMATE CHANGE. AND IT IS NOW TIME FOR CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE TO FOLLOW THE LEAD. WE ARE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF THE FOSSIL FUEL. INDUSTRY ACCORDING TO CARBON TRUCKER INVESTORS IN THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY ARE UNDERWAY OF THE SPEED AT WHICH CLEAN ENERGY WILL DOMINATE THE ENERGY MARKET. REGARDLESS OF OUR CURRENT ADMINISTRATION'S EFFORTS TO BOAST OF THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MAJOR CORPORATIONS ARE LEADING THE WAY COMMITTING TO BECOMING A HUNDRED PERCENT RENEWABLE ENERGY. BY SELF IMPOSED STATES FACEBOOK GOOGLE APPLE ARE ALREADY THERE. AND. OF THE CORPORATIONS INCLUDE WALMART UNILEVER WELLS FARGO AND MAWS THEY'RE NOT DOING THIS FOR PHILANTHROPIC REASONS THEY'RE DOING IT BECAUSE IT IS COST EFFECTIVE AND. A IS COST EFFECTIVE AND MAKES GOOD BUSINESS SENSE. I AM AT YOU WANT E TO STOP HERE I AM I'M GETTING BODY LANGUAGE FROM HEWLETT. WHILE MODERN TECHNOLOGY IS ALSO AFFECTING THIS RAPID TRANSITION. OKAY I AM AWARE VERY WITH. TESSLER HAS UNVEILED. A SEMI TRUCK AND. THAT WHICH IS GOING TO BE. THE BIGGEST CATALYST IN TRUCKING IN DECADES AND THIS COULD BE SEVENTY BITS AND CHEAPER TO OPERATE. A WALMART AGAIN BUT NOT PUTS A PHILANTHROPIC REASONS. OKAY AND BRITISH THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY AS WELL EASY JET QUE AND THE BRITISH AIRLINE INDUSTRY WITH RIGHTS ELECTRIC SO WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT AND TO THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRIES HERE.

AND WHAT EFFECT WILL THAT HAVE ON MY PENSION FUND I THINK WE'LL BE ARE HUGELY DILATORY YES WE HEARD A PERSON HERE SPEAK OF THE RISKS OF DIVESTING. WHAT I'M REALLY WORRIED ABOUT HERE IS THE RISK OF MAINTAINING THIS BUSINESS AS USUAL APPROACH TWO PAULSON FUELED WITH WHICH DON'T SERIOUS EFFECTS ON MY? ON MY PENSION FUND. THE SPEED OF TRANSITION WILL HAPPEN HERE FASTER THINK OF WHEN WE DID NOT HAVE A A A IPHONE. ARE. THE I SPEED UP INTO THE NON CARBON. ENERGY MARKET OUR SYSTEM IS GOING TO BE FASTER THAN THAT SO I THINK THATNEW YORK STATE I THINK WE ARE GOVERNOR CUOMO IN THE LATE LAMENTED AT LEAD. FROM SAN FRANCISCO GOT IT WE NEED TO GET IN MISTER LEADERS WORDS WE NEED TO PROTECT THE WELL LEARN FINANCIAL SECURITY FIRE RETIREES. BY IDENTIFYING THE RISKIEST DIRTIEST ASSETS TO BE REPLACED BY CLEANER HIGH PERFORMING ASSETS I ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES MY EMPLOYERS MIGHT PAYEES AT CAL STIRS TO. A MAN GET OUT OF FOSSIL FUELS QUICKLY PROTECT MY PHONE SO I CAN LIVE TO BE A HUNDRED AND HAVE. A FEWER RISKS TO MY FUND AND I ENCOURAGE THE STATE ASSEMBLY AND LET AND STAND TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO DO SO. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU. WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS CLANFIELD BEN I'M A CALPERS MEMBER AND A PROFESSOR OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES AT THE CSU. I'M HERE TO URGE THE LEGISLATURE NOT TO EXCLUDE ANY OPTION INCLUDING A LEGISLATIVE MANDATE TO THE VAST. FROM CONSIDERATION. CARBON POLLUTION IS ACTUALLY PART OF THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRIES CORE BUSINESS THAT'S WHAT THEIR BUSINESS IS ABOUT AFTER THEY GET OUT OF THE GROUND AND HAVE US BY IT AND BURN IT. SO WHILE THEY MAY BE WILLING TO DO THINGS LIKE REDUCE METHANE EMISSIONS WHICH REALLY ON COULD END UP BEING PROFITABLE FOR THEM. ARE THEY ARE UNDERSTANDABLY DRAGGING THEIR FEET WHEN IT COMES TO. ENGAGING IN OTHER LINES OF BUSINESS SUCH AS RENEWABLE ENERGY. AND. AS THEY DRAG THEIR FEET THEY ARE SUBJECTING. OUR RETIREMENT FUNDS I THINK TO REALLY SERIOUS FINANCIAL RISK. THE RISKS ARE LEGAL WE'VE SEEN LAWSUITS I THINK IT'S JUST BEGINNING OF THOSE THE RISKS ARE REGULATORY. SO AT A VERY MINIMUM I URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO ESTABLISH A MONITORING MECHANISM. TO ASK OUR RETIREMENT FUNDS HOW SUCCESSFUL ARE YOU. AT GETTING. ENGAGEMENT AND AT IT. USING ENGAGEMENTS TO GET THE FOSSIL FUEL FUND OUR COMPANIES. TO REDUCE THEIR CARBON EMISSIONS. AND THERE'S ONE BIG FACT I THINK THAT UNDERLINES THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT. PARIS AGREEMENT SET OUT A TEMPERATURE SEALING IF YOU WILL OF TWO DEGREES CELSIUS. ARM RIGHT NOW EVEN IF EVERYONE KEEPS THEIR COMMITMENTS ALL THE COUNTRIES THAT THAT SIGNED ON OF COURSE WE KNOW THE UNITED STATES HAS SIGNED OFF. WE WON'T MEET AT THAT TEMPERATURE TARGET. ARM IN ORDER TO MEET THAT TEMPERATURE COMMITMENT SCIENTISTS ARE NOW TELLING US. THAT WE NEED TO BEND THE GLOBAL EMISSIONS CURVE SHARPLY DOWNWARD BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY. LAST YEAR. OUR EMISSIONS WENT UP BY TWO PERCENT. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU. WELCOME. CAN. THANK YOU A MUCH I'M JANET* I'M ALSO CALPERS RETIREE. UP THAT IT THAT THE CENTER PAN YOUR COMMITTEE LAST YEAR. PASSED S. B. FIVE SIXTY WITCHES BEN ALLEN'S BILL THAT DEFINES FINANCIAL BUT WERE NOW CAUGHT CLIMATE. RELATED FINANCIAL RISK. AND I'M HOPING THAT THAT BILL IS GOING TO COME BACK WE'VE BEEN NEGOTIATING WITH CALPERS AND CAL STIR SINCE THEN. BUT AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW THE OF. APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE IS HOLDING ALL TWO YEAR BILLS. BUT. SINCE THAT TIME THE CONVERSATION HAS CHANGED AND I THINK IT'S CHANGED. BECAUSE. BOTH OF THE PHYSICAL RISK HAS BECOME SO MUCH MORE OBVIOUS WITHOUT HER CANES. AND THE FIRES AND THIS WEEK THE FLOODS. AND ALSO LITIGATION RISK HAS BECOME. I THINK PROBABLY ON A PAR WITH STRANDED ASSET RISK. FOR MANY OF THE INVESTMENTS THAT CALPERS AND CULTURES HOLD SO I JUST. WHY KEIRA HOLD THE THOUGHT AND HOLD THE THOUGHT OF THIS BILL WHEN IT COMES BACK BECAUSE? I THINK THAT. BUT THE POINT OF. CODE OF FLYING. THAT RISK AND REQUIRING PENSION FUNDS TO CONSIDER IT AND REPORT ON IT. IS IT'S GOING TO HELP MOVE US. TO A PLACE WHERE MISTER COOLIES COMMENT THAT. IT'S A IT MIGHT BE A GOOD THING TO GET OUT AHEAD OF THE RISK AND. SELL THOSE. SHARES BEFORE. THE SECTOR CRASHES. MAKE IT ALL WORK BETTER FOR BY THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU. STOP UNDOCUMENTED BUG PUBLIC HERMAN SENATOR LET TED TOPIC FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE RETIREES WE REPRESENT. THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND STATE RETIREES ALL OUR MEMBERS OF THE CALPERS SYSTEM. I WILL BE BRIEF AND. HOPEFULLY NOT TOO REPETITIVE I'M GONNA TRY TO WRAP IT UP BY EIGHT TEN. OF. FORGIVE. THE STATE RETIREES ARE HUGE ADVOCATES OF THE CONSTRUCTIVE GAUGE WENT POLICY CALPERS IN ANOTHER. A PENSION SYSTEMS. THIS IS THE WAY TO ADDRESS BAD ACTORS AND A RESPONSIBLE CORPORATE BEHAVIOR. TO KEEP RECEIVED AT THE TABLE USER PROXY VOTES AND TO. URGE THEM TO IMPROVE THEIR UP BEHAVIOR OR TO. CHANGE IT ALL TOGETHER. DIVESTMENT SHOULD BE A LAST RESORT SHOULD BE RARE AND VERY. THIS IS THE NUCLEAR OPTION. OUR IT DOES NOT SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM. THAT FACES THE THIS COUNTRY ARE THE STATE AND CERTAINLY NOT THE SYSTEM. ARM AND THEM MOST IMPORTANT THING OUR MIND YOU THAT HAS BEEN MENTIONED HERE A NUMBER OF TIMES. CALPERS ANOTHER PENSION SYSTEMS EXIST SOLELY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE MEMBERS OF THE SYSTEM.
