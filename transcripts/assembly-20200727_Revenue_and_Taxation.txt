GB RG SUPPORT ACTIVE SOLAR SYSTEMS CONTINUE TO HAVE AN EXCLUSION FROM PROPERTY TAXES CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT LAW THAT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND WE SUPPORT THAT THAT IS WHY WE ARE PART OF A BROAD BASED COALITION TODAY. ACTUALLY OPPOSING PROP FIFTEEN ON THE NOVEMBER BALLOT PROP FIFTY IS POORLY DRAFTED HAS A SERIES OF MAJOR FLAWS INCLUDING REMOVING EXISTING CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS FOR THE INSTALLATION FOR THE INSTALLATION OF NEW ACTORS SOLAR SYSTEMS. WHICH ARE CURRENTLY EXCLUDED FROM PROPERTY TAXATION UNTIL THERE'S A CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP. UNDER PROP FIFTEEN COMMERCIAL ACTORS SOLAR SYSTEMS WILL BE TAXES THAT PRAYER MARKET VALUE AS OFTEN AS EVERY YEAR BUT AT LEAST EVERY THREE YEARS WE ARE OPPOSED TO THREE SIXTY FOUR BECAUSE CLEARLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND FLIES IN THE FACE OF DECADES OF THOSE THAT WAS CASE LAW. IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN THE CALIFORNIA COURT STRUCK DOWN A SIMILAR ACCOUNT BY THE LEGISLATURE TO CIRCUMVENT THE CONSTITUTION AND LUCAS PERSON MONTEREY THE COURT FOUND THAT THE LEGISLATION ATTEMPTING TO RE CLASS BY BOAT SLIPS SO THEY ARE NO LONGER PROPERLY BE AN EXAM FROM STATION GOES ON.

SB THREE SIXTY FOUR FOR THE DAY TRUSTED ALLOWING THE LEGISLATURE PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS. PROPERTY TWO SO PROTECTIONS IN A MERE STATUTORY ONE LEAVING MANY OF CALIFORNIA'S CRITICAL INDUSTRIES AT THE MERCY. OF THE LET GREATER. PROPERTY TAKE CARES APPLE OVER THREE RESTAURANT SMALL BUSINESS AND DAIRY JUST A FEW RIGHT NOW MOST OF THOSE IN YOUR DON'T EVEN THAT THAT FIRST OR JUST TO SERVE AND YOU KNOW HAVE THE TO MYBUT IN TO GET THE TWO OF CAR THE SO INTO IS THAT FOR TODAY SO WITH SB THIRTY THREE SIXTY FOUR IT'S CLEARLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL OPPOSED BY CALIFORNIA'S ASSESSORS ASSOCIATION AND JUST BAD PUBLIC POLICY FOR ALL THOSE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO OPPOSE SB THREE SIXTY FOUR. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU WITH THE MODERATOR PLEASE NOW OPEN THE MAINLAND FOR ANY ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION TO HER TESTIMONY.

AND WE HAVE NO FURTHER PARTICIPANTS SHOWING OPPOSITION PLEASE CONTINUE THANK YOU QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. DOCTOR QUIRK WELCOME BACK. WITH SOMEONE ON THE SUPPORT SIDE DRESSED. ISSUE ISSUE. THE CHANCES THAT THE COURT PRESENT OF THE THIS WOULD BE ON. SO THANK YOU FOR THE DOCTOR YOU KNOW WHICH RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH MY IN A FORMER ASSESSOR COLLEAGUES- AGAIN THIS IS A- THIS IS TRYING TO CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT THE WILL OF THE VOTERS. THE PROPOSITION THAT WAS PASSED BY THE VOTERS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY. IT IS A VERY NARROW VERY SPECIFIC FIX- BASED ON THE BUT HOW IN A BASED ON HOW PROPOSITION FIFTEEN WAS WRITTEN. AND SO AGAIN- ON THERE IS CASE LAW WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE WILL OF THE VOTERS- REALLY ULTIMATELY IS WHAT STANCE AND SO BECAUSE THIS. ACCIDENTALLY OVER RIGHTS THAT WILL THE VOTERS- THIS BILL WOULD CONTINUE TO PRESERVE THAT WILL IN GOING FORWARD TOLD TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AGAIN. THIS IS ONLY FOR SOLAR SYSTEMS AND ONLY IF THEY- DIDN'T CHANGE DID NOT CHANGE OWNERSHIP SO IT'S A VERY SMALL. THE LIST OF PROPERTIES. OKAY THANK YOU BUT IT SOUNDS AS IF YOU AGREE THAT THIS COURT CASES THAT. HE THE JUDGES DECIDE TO FOLLOW THE COURT'S PREVIOUS COURT CASES AS A POWER TO. THE WILL OF THE VOTERS THIS BILL. YEAH I HAVEN'T FOLLOWED THE SPECIFIC WORKERS OR FOR ANY OF THE SUPPORTERS WANT TO SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THAT COURT CASE AND HAPPY TO LET THEM. I BELIEVE WE HAVE SOMEONE COMING TO MAKE THEM. MELCHER MEMBERS JERRY BROWN ON BEHALF OF SCA YOU AGAIN- WE'VE ASKED OUR ATTORNEYS THE LAW FIRM A- RAM SHOW AND ALSO IN. THEY'VE REVIEWED THIS AND ITS RELATIONSHIP. IS CONSTITUTIONAL AND THEREFORE THE ARGUMENT SO DON'T NEED TO MUSTER. EVERY SEMESTER I THOUGHT. MYSTERIES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. SO I'M STRUGGLING A LITTLE BIT WITH THIS ONE AND TO BE HONEST- AND IT'S BECAUSE I LOVE SOLAR- I COME FROM A RIVERSIDE AND SAN BENITO COUNTY AND WE HAVE AN AWFUL LOT OF SUNSHINE AND WE HAVE AN AWFUL LOT OF LAND- AND WE HAVE MADE INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF SOUL DEVELOPS I'M A BIG BIG FAN OF. OF SOLAR I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THE VOTERS- HAVE- AB IT HAD AGREED WITH SOME LANGUAGE- BUT IT JUST SEEMS ODD TO ME- A COUPLE THINGS YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY BUT THE ONE THING THAT WE DON'T QUESTION THAT I HAVE IS WHY NOW- WHY ARE WE DOING THIS NOW AND WHERE WE DOING THIS- AFTER NOVEMBER WHY WOULD WE DO THIS NEXT YEAR IF IT WAS. IT IS NECESSARY AND I DO HAVE A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS. NO I'M NOT GONNA LET ADVOCATES- RESTAURANTS PACIFICA CHEVRON THEY THINK YOU MIGHT AS WELL. JUST STAY UP HERE I THINK WE HAVE A SERIES OF QUESTIONS I THINK THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS. HELLO CAN I ANSWER THIS QUESTION. ABSOLUTELY CORRECT- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE QUESTION- IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT COUPLE THAT I MAKES IS BUILDING B. E. LONG PROJECT- JUST NORTH OF LA IT'S ONE OF THE LOWEST PRICE IN THE WORLD- VERY LARGE PROJECT. EMPLOYEES UNIONIZED LABOR. AS IT STANDS NOW THE FINANCING IS COMPLETELY FROZEN THE UNCERTAINTY ON PROPERTY TAX IT IS A MAJOR ISSUES O- UNFORTUNATELY TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE- AND. HAT ON THIRTIETH SOME POINT IS GOING TO START KILLING PROJECTS. NOT JUST BEYOND YOU KNOW WE WORK WITH A LOT OF. FATHER. WHEN YOU BUDGET BUSTERS SO I DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANY JOB LOSSES. BECAUSE BASICALLY OF UNCERTAINTY AND IN IN PROPERTY TAXES. THANK YOU. I BELIEVE THE SIMILARITIES HAS ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT YEAH THEN I CAN THIS IS THE END THIS IS BY THE WAY INCREDIBLY AWKWARD AS WE. ALL KNOW AND COMMITTEE BECAUSE OF OUR SOCIAL DISTANCING ALL THINGS ARE TO. IT MAKES LEDGES INCREDIBLY DE MAKES THE FLOW OF IN. A VERY VERY DIFFICULT AND SO A PLEASE FORGIVE ME FOR EVEN HAVING THESE QUESTIONS I WISH I COULD HAVE GOT SOME ANSWERED- BEFORE- BUT IT DOES SEEM WHEN I LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE IS. A LANGUAGE. WE'RE DEFINING. WHAT IS KNOWN TODAY AS REAL PROPERTY. AND WE'RE FINDING IT AS PERSONAL PROPERTY. SO THAT IF IN INITIATIVE THE GETS PASSED IN NOVEMBER THIS WOULD THEN BECOME BECOME A BIG EXEMPTS AND YET. EVEN IN THE LANGUAGE ITSELF FOR SAYING IT'S ONLY GOING TO BE DEFINED AS PERSONAL PROPERTY INTEL TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND THEN AFTER TWENTY TWENTY FIVE I WANT TO MAKE ONE MAKE SURE I GET THIS CORRECTLY CORRECT THAT AFTER TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE'RE GOING TO IT'S GONNA BE DEFINED AS REAL PROPERTY AGAIN. SO IT SEEMS LIKE WE MIGHT BE JUMPING THROUGH SOME HOOPS HERE- BUT BECAUSE THE AN INITIATIVE WASN'T CRAFTED APPROPRIATE MY ON TO SOMETHING HERE OR MY MISSING SOMETHING. THIS IS ALL IN ALL THIS IS A FORM. CARRIER THIS IS NOT THE- IS THIS NEW WASN'T HE BEST WAY TO DRAFT IT I'D SAY THAT THIS IS THE- WAY TO DRAFT ITTOO AGAIN MAINTAINED THE DESIRED THE VOTERS THAT FOR THE NINETEEN EIGHTY- YOU KNOW WE- WE DON'T ALWAYS GET TO LEGISLATE THE PERFECT LEGISLATION I THINK THIS IS THE WE DECIDED- THIS WAS THE BEST WAY TO AGAIN- MAKE SURE THAT WE MAINTAIN THE WILL OF THE VOTERS- THAT WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT A VERY IMPORTANT INDUSTRY THAT WAS. INADVERTENTLY HARM TO BY THE POTENTIAL BALLOT INITIATIVE AND SO THIS WAY- YOU KNOW WE COULD DO BOTH I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU THAT IT IS NOT IT IS NOT A PERFECT SOLUTION BUT VERY RARELY DO WE HAVE PERFECT SOLUTIONS IN OUR LEGISLATURE ISN'T ENOUGH TO CAN MANAGER JUST ONE ON ONE MORE QUESTION IS THERE ANOTHER WAY TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THIS OTHER THAN- IT WRITTEN AGAIN IT SEEMS PRETTY SLOPPY TO MEAN- THAT WE WOULD BE RUNNING A PIECE OF LEGISLATION LIKE THIS AT THE AT THIS IS OR SOME OTHER WAY TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF. THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. THEN THROUGH. IT WHAT SEEMS TO ME TO BE INTELLECTUALLY DISHONEST YEAH SO- LOOK AS AS A FORMER. COUNTY ASSESSOR I ASSURED- DECLARE. THE IN OUR FULL WAY THAT THIS WAS DONE WITH MY FORMER COLLEAGUES- WE DID CLOSE A LOOPHOLE THAT WAS EVEN BROADER IN- AB ONE OH FIVE SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE DOING THE SB THREE SIX WAR. SO WE DID FURTHER NARAL WHERE. TO AGAIN ONLY. BE CONSISTENT WITH PROPOSITION SEVEN FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY- SO WE DID THAT BUT IT BUT AGAIN- WE WERE NOT ABLE TO FIND ANOTHER WAY TO MAINTAIN A AND THE WILL OF THE VOTER. FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR SALT- SO THIS WAS- THE BEST WAY THAT WE COULD. WE COULD DO ABOUT STILL MAINTAIN THAT CONSISTENCY. YES WE DO WE DID EXPLORE OTHER OPTIONS THERE'S NO QUESTION. MR GREAT ARE YOU ARE YOU- MISTER GRAY YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. GOOD TO SEE YOU FIRST THING APPRECIATE THE COURTESY THAT YOU'VE AFFORDED THE SENATE IN PRESENTING THIS BILL FOR THE OFFICE. UNFORTUNATELY I THINK. MY COLLEAGUE RAISES IMPORTANT ISSUES ABOUT THE BOTH INTELLECTUAL HONESTY OR DISHONESTY- CONTAINED IN THIS APPROACH ALTHOUGH I ALSO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF MERIT IN WHAT'S BEING DONE. IN THIS LEGISLATION. BUT THERE'S BEEN REAL MIXED MESSAGE FROM THE STATE SENATE. ON HOW WERE PRIORITIZING. LEGISLATION DURING A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS- THAT'S ON PRESIDENT. AND I KNOW I'VE PUT LEGISLATION FORWARD IN THE STATE SENATE THAT WOULD RAISE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BY BRING IN BLACK MARKET ACTIVITIES- I'VE PUT LEGISLATION THE SENATE TO. DEAL WITH THE EPIDEMIC OF YOUTH VAPING THE SENATE'S NOT SEEN THE WISDOM AND EVEN HEARING. THOSE PIECE OF LEGISLATION. SO AS OF TODAY DESPITE THE MERITS CONTAIN THIS BILL AND CERTAINLY NO REFLECTION ON YOU MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO BUT A REFLECTION ON THE STATE SENATE I WILL BE SUPPORTING ANY. ESPY'S AT THIS TIME UNTIL WE CAN GET. SOME RATIONAL. AGREEMENT WITH OUR COLLEAGUES ON HOW TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS SO. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION BUT I WILL BE SUPPORTED. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. YEAH I THINK VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR- THANK YOU. MISTER KING FOR A PRESENT IN THIS BILL I SHARE A LOT OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE JUST HEARD FROM OUR COLLEAGUE FROM MERCED. THE SENATE IS FAILING US AND IS FEELING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE'RE GIVING GOOD TIME. RIGHT HERE TO TALK ABOUT A POLICY ONE WHICH I AGREE WITH AND THAT I WILL VOTE FOR TODAY BECAUSE I'M GOING TO. FOCUS ON THE VOTE BEFORE ME. BUT ONE THAT IS NOT GOING TO IMPACT US MAYBE EVER. IN LESS PROP FIFTEEN PASSES AND THEN WE HAVE BEEN TOLD TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. TO DECIDE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. AND WE'RE WE'RE LISTENING TO THIS LEGISLATION WERE GIVING DEBATE TO THIS LEGISLATION WERE AIRING THE POLICY OUT. AND WE SHOULD NOT BE TODAY. CERTAINLY I AS OUR COLLEAGUES STATED WITH THE SENATE NOT TAKING UP LEGISLATION GERMANE TO ISSUES THAT ARE RIGHT IN FRONT OF US TODAY. THE HEALTH COMMITTEE IS NOT EVEN THE GEN DIS SEEN MY BILL ON SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. BGO COMMITTEE IS NOT LISTENING IS NOT SCHEDULING MY BILL ON PUBLIC SAFETY POWERSHOT OFFICE- AND YET WORSE SPENDING TIME ON A BILL THAT MAY OR MAY NOT. HAVE ANY IMPACT ON US AND IF IT DOES UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. SO I FEEL LIKE WE'RE WASTING IN. GOOD TIME OR WE'RE DOING OUR JOB IN THE SENATE IS NOT UP TO THIS MOMENT. THANK YOU. QUIRK. BACK TO MY COLLEAGUES WHO DON'T WANT TO VOTE FOR THIS NOW I WOULD JUST SAY THAT. YOU KNOW THIS THIS YEAR IT'S JUST BEEN AWFUL. AND I'M NOT. I'M GONNA BE VOTING THE BILL AND FRANKLY THE SENATE SIMPLY DOESN'T HAVE THE BANDWIDTH TO HEAR ALL THE BELLS AND MAYBE. SOME DECISIONS YOU DON'T LIVE. BUT SENSE TO- NOT BAD FOR A BILL THAT YOU LIKE. BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T GET WHAT YOU WANT OUT OF THE SENATE I WOULD ASK YOU TO RECONSIDER AND VOTE ON THE MERITS OF THE BELL AND THIS DOES NEED TO GET DONE NOW. FOR THE REASONS THAT WE HEARD FROM THE SUPPORTERS THAT. TO GO FORWARD WITH SOME PROJECTS THEY'RE GOING TO NEED TO HAVE SOME CLARITY ON THIS. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE IT UP NOW RATHER THAN AFTER AND PASS AND THEN IT GOES INTO EFFECT. WHEN THE- PROPOSITION GOES INTO EFFECT THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. SO FOR CLARITY PURPOSES FOR THOSE WHO ARE- CONCERN ABOUT THE SENATE THIS THIS BILL WAS REQUESTED THAT WE HEAR TODAY BY LEADERSHIP SO OUR LEADERSHIP- SO FOR THOSE WHO ARE CONCERNED- HAVE QUESTIONS.

FIRST INSTEAD OF PUBLISHING THE COMPLETE LIST OF TAXPAYERS AND COMPANY INFORMATION ON MTV'S WEBSITE THE INFORMATION REQUIRED BY THIS BILL SHOULD BE PROVIDED TO THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON REVENUE AND TAXATION. AND THE SENATE GOVERNMENT'S GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE COMMITTEE. SECOND THE IMP. WILL BE AND- WILL INCLUDE THIS. TYPE OF TAX CREDITS CLAIMED BY THE TAXPAYER.

ALONG WITH THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION. THE TAXPAYER'S NAME AS REPORTED ON THE RETURN THE TOTAL TAX LIABILITY. TOTAL AMOUNT OF CREDITS AND THE TYPE OF CREDITS CLEAN BY THE TAXPAYER. SB NINE SEVENTY TWO DOES NOT RAISE TAXES OR ELIMINATE CREDITS IT JUST GIVES INFORMATION. LIST LEVEL OF ACCESS TO SPECIFIC TAXPAYER INFORMATION IS NOT UNPRECEDENTED SEVERAL STATES ALREADY REQUIRE SOME DISCLOSURE OF SPECIFIC TAXPAYER INFORMATION. WHEN CLEAVING SPECIFICS STATE TAX CREDITS. IN FACT CALIFORNIA COMPETES TAX CREDIT ON THE FILM TAX CREDIT BOTH ALREADY REQUIRED DISCLOSURE OF SPECIFIC INFORMATION TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW CERTAIN STEPS. INFLUENCE BEHAVIOR. UNFORTUNATELY SPECIFIC TAX PAYER INFORMATION IS LIMITED TO A HANDFUL OF TAX CREDIT PROGRAMS. WE SOMETIMES LACK THE HARD DATA ON CALIFORNIA'S TAX CREDITS AND THAT IS WHY SB SET NINE SEVENTY TWO IS NEEDED SO THAT WE CAN HAVE MORE INFORMATION. ON TAX CREDIT GIVEN THE STATE. ON BEHALF OF CENTER SKINNER I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AND I. VERY WELL. I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE ONE PRIMARY WITNESS IN SUPPORT OF HEARING TODAY IN PERSON.

COMMITTEES ALREADY HAVE A FORTY. TO ACCESS ANY TAXPAYER SPECIFIC DATA IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT- THESE AMENDMENTS WOULD ALLOW THE PUBLIC TO GAIN ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION. WOULD ANYONE BE ABLE TO CONFIRM THAT WERE.

THANK YOU I SO I'M TRYING TO JUST WRAP MY HEAD AROUND WHAT PROBLEM THIS BILL IS TRYING TO SOLVE AND WHAT ACTUALLY IT WOULD SOLVE SO THE OPPOSITION NOTED THAT LAWMAKERS ARE READY DO YOU HAVE ACCESS TO AGGREGATE DATA FROM YOU HAVE TO BE IS THAT CORRECT SO WE DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO REQUEST DATA HOWEVER I WILL SAY THIS- WE'VE HAD SEVERAL BILLS THAT HAVE COME TO US ON THE WE ARE HEARING SOMETHING THAT WE ARE NOT HEARING. THAT ARE REQUESTING THIS KIND OF INFORMATION AND THE REALITY IS THAT LIKE WITH THE FILM TAX CREDIT WE WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN% TO EXPAND THAT IF WE HADN'T SEEN IT WAS WORKING AND HOW DO WE SEE IF SOMETHING IS WORKING WE DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION SO IT'S A KIND OF CATCH TWENTY TWO. RIGHT IT'S- I KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO WE AS A COMMITTEE KNOW WHAT IS AND ISN'T WORKING WHICH IS WHY WE CHANGE THE AMENDMENT. TO NOT POSTING IT ON THE WEBSITE IT'S NOT FOR THE PURPOSES OF SHAMING. BUT HOW DO WE SEE WHAT'S ACTUALLY FUNCTIONING WELL SO THAT WE EITHER EXPANDED. OR REMOVE IT AND- WILL HAVE TRIED WE'VE HAD SEVERAL SENATORS TRIED TO COME AT THIS PROBLEM AND IF DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. I DO ACTUALLY AGREE THAT THE SHOULD BE METRICS YOU CAN SEE A MORE COMPLETE PICTURE AND THAT'S SOMETHING THE AUTHOR CAN CONTINUE TO WORK ON AND APPROPRIATIONS. BUT. BECAUSE WE GOT THAT IN FOR FROM THE TAX CREDIT WE WERE IT TO EXPAND AND WAS A GOOD THIS. YOU KNOW SO THAT'S REALLY THE THAT'S THAT'S THE ISSUE YEAH BUT WE'RE TRYING TO CONTEND WITH IN A IN A WAY THAT IT'S THE REASON WE CHANGE THE RULES OF THIS COMMITTEE TO MAKING- MOST OF OUR TAX CREDITS FIVE YEARS. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A WAY TO REVIEW THEM AND WE ARE ASKING FOR MORE INFORMATION ON EACH BILL NOW WE REQUIRE IT. WE REQUIRE SECTION FORTY ONE SO THAT WE HAVE METRIC SAYS WHICH TO MEASURE IT HOWEVER A LOT OF ROLE TAX CREDITS WE DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION AND THEIR ON GOING IN PERPETUITY. WELL I COULDN'T SO I COULDN'T AGREE MORE WITH YOU THAT WE NEED TO. HAVE EVERY EVERY PIECE OF DATA POSSIBLE TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF TAX CREDITS AND TAX EXPENDITURES. YES I'M NOT STANDING Y. TAX PAYER SPECIFIC DISCLOSURE. IS IN ORDER TO GET THAT. HOW HOW WOULD YOU GET IT. WOULD YOU COULD AGGREGATED. BY TAX CREDIT RATHER THAN BY YOU DON'T NEED TO HAVE RATED BUT I THINK ACTS ARTICLE IN THE END OF THIS IS TO SEE THEM OF THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE IS THERE IS THAT COMPANY ALTHOUGH HIRING HERE AND THERE IS A LONG TERM MORE COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT THE TAX CREDIT. THAT I THINK WE'RE HOPING TO GAIN AT SOME POINT YEAH I THINK INDIVIDUAL SORT OF LINE ITEM DATA IT'S VERY HARD TO YOU ASCERTAIN TRENDS ARE TO DRAW CONCLUSIONS FROM AND YOU ACTUALLY NEED AGGREGATE DATA IN ORDER TO YOU. HAVE YOU PERFORM ACCURATE ANALYSIS SEPT I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS BILL TAKES IT FEELS TO ME LIKE IT'S MORE KIND OF IF YEAH POKING A FINGER IN THE EYE OF BUSINESS WITHOUT IN MY VIEW KIND OF AN APPRECIABLE. WILL BENEFIT. ONE HUNDRED. IN ONE SO IF I CAN JUST A COUPLE I THOUGHT THIS WAS- HAD BRACER FINGER EARLIER SO MY APOLOGIES. DOCTOR QUIRK. AT SO BUT- I'M LOOKING AT THE ANALYSIS HERE AND IT JUST SAYS DEFINES GROSS RECEIPTS THE SAME AS THE FINDER REVVING TAX CODE SECTION TWENTY FIVE ONE TWENTY IS THAT THE LANGUAGE HERE. THAT SAYS THAT THIS IS- GROSS RECEIPTS ON WORLDWIDE INCOME. CAN SOMEBODY. CAN SOMEBODY ANSWER THAT QUESTION I JUST I'M I'M WONDERING WHY WE DISCERN FRIEND. OF ONE OR MAYBE THE CONSULTANT- CAN CAN ANSWER IF SOMEBODY CAN MAYBE YOU CAN ANSWER I GUESS I'M I'M REALLY WONDERING WHY WE DECIDED. WHY IT'S THE FIVE BILLION IS THE NUMBER. AND IT SEEMS SOMEWHAT NOT SOMEONE IT IS INCONSISTENT TO THINK THAT THERE'S SOME COMPANIES THAT ARE INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES THAT DO VERY LITTLE BUSINESS HERE. AND THAT WE WOULD BE GETTING ALL OF THAT INFORMATION- FROM FROM FROM THEM EVEN THOUGH THEY MIGHT ONLY DO A LITTLE BIT OF A BUSINESS YEAR VERSUS A COMPANY THAT'S MAYBE BASED IN CALIFORNIA THAT DOES- A LOT OF BUSINESS HERE SO HOW DO WE COME UP WITH THAT WITH THAT FIGURE IN HIS AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS- THIS IS GROSS WORLDWIDE INCOME IS THAT RIGHT. IN THE ROOM THREE FEET YEAH INCOME AND FRANKLY THE REASON IT WAS PEGGED AT FIVE BILLION WAYS TO. RESTRICTOR FENCE IN THE AMOUNT OF COMPANIES JUST BASICALLY GET YOU THE TOP TWO HUNDRED COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA. IN TERMS OF GROSS RECEIPTS. SO WE'RE NOT GOING AFTER SMALL BUSINESSES WERE NOT REACHING AND A- YOU KNOW. ASKING THE FTP TO PROVIDE TONS OF INFORMATION- THAT. DOESN'T IMPACT DECISION MAKING BUT BASICALLY TAKES A LARGEST CORPORATIONS. THE LARGEST COMPANIES WITH THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF TAX CREDITS. AND THAT'S THAT'S HOW YOU GOT THERE IT IT BASICALLY RESTRICTED SOMEWHERE AROUND TWO HUNDRED. COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA- MISS RIGHT NOW SO IS IT THE TOTAL WORLDWIDE REVENUE. I BELIEVE IF IT'S CALIFORNIA RECEIVED BUT I'LL HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT GET BACK TO. WHAT THE- COULD YOU GIVE WOULD BE FAR WITHOUT. YEAH IF YOU RIGHT AWAY PLEASE CHAPTER WILL LISTEN TO A LITTLE BIT. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. ALL RIGHT- WELL MISTER BLAND SHIPS- WHAT THE BILL DOES. MADAM CHAIR- YOU COULD CLOSE AND I ALSO WANTED TO CONFIRM THAT THE SENATOR IS ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS SET FORTH IN THE CANADIAN ALICE'S. WHICH YOU HAVE ALSO REFERRED TO. IS THAT CORRECT THAT IS CORRECT. CLOSE. IT'S SOMETHING I THINK THAT YOU KNOW I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR THEIR QUESTIONS TODAY YOU KNOW IT THIS IT HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE TO FIND THE RIGHT WAY TO REALLY ANALYZE THESE BILL ANALYZE TESE TAX CREDITS WE HAVE LOOKED NOT JUST FROM OUR COMMITTEE LEVEL BUT ON AND OFF BASIS HOW TO BEST DO THAT. AND THIS IS. PLANE FIRST. IN THAT HOUSES THAT WE REALLY DO NEED TO TAKE TAKE- AT SOME POINT TAKE A STAB AT. WITH THAT. WHEN MISTER BURNING COMES BACK TO ANSWER HIS QUESTIONS WE CAN I RESPECTFULLY ACOSTA NAY ABOUT. LET ME SAID THAT. MORE REFLECTING ON A VERY DIFFICULT YEAR AND. I THINK THAT SENATOR JACKSON'S BILL HAD SHE TAKEN OUT THE COMMITTEE WOULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER WAY TO GO ABOUT THIS. BUT AT THE MOMENT THIS IS THE ONLY VEHICLE WOULD HAVE. HAVE WITH THE CHAIRS THE COMMISSION WILL WAIT FOR MR NON LOOKS LIKE HE'S COMING BACK TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. I'VE BEEN. ARE BETTER FOR THE- REVENUE TAX COMMITTEE CONTROLLED ON THE SENATE SIDE AND YOU HAVE TO BE THAT IT'S WORLDWIDE REVENUES FIVE BILLION. AND WORLDWIDE GROSS FOR FREE. TWELVE ONE NEVER SHARED WITH ANYTHING ELSE TO SELL. HOW NO I DO WE DID HAVE A COUPLE AND TO YOUR COMMENTS WE DID HAVE A FEW BILLS TO LOOK AT THAT WERE AND THAT IN THIS VEIN- BOTH BILLS FACE THEIR CHALLENGES WITH THIS COMMITTEE- AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THE AUTHOR MOVING FORWARD SHOULD LOOK AT SOME OF THE METRICS THAT ARE ANY OTHER BILL HOWEVER THE- MECHANISM BY WHICH- THERE'S- I CAN ISN'T ANY OTHER% BILL THAT. WERE NOT FUNCTIONAL FOR MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE SO- I DO I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE METRICS AS THEY MOVED INTO APPROPRIATIONS BUT THEY DO TH LIKE I SAY. LIKE I SAID WE HAVE A LOT OF TAX CREDITS THAT ARE GOING. USE BUT NOT REALLY BENEFITING THE COMMUNITY IN THE WAY THEY SHOULD. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY QUESTION I WILL. THE OF THE SUPPORTING THIS BILL FOR NINE DO WE HAVE A MOTION. SEVEN SEVEN. MOVED BY MISTER CHOOSE BLINDNESS. MOTION IS DAY PASSES AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS. MISTER RUFF PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

IF I IF I CAN- I'M A BIG SUPPORTER OF THE ATC AND I IT YEP EVEN THE FEDERAL LEVEL- IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME- I THINK WE IN INSTITUTED THE A. T. C. FOR MEMBER CORRECTLY MAYBE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN TWENTY. SIXTEEN SO IT'S STILL ROAD NEW IN IN CALIFORNIA- THE ONE THING I'M I'M WONDERING WITH THIS IS THIS IS JUST A STUDY BILL OR IS THIS ARE WE TRYING TO SET US UP POLICY WITH IT BECAUSE THE REASON I SAY THAT IS IT BE GREAT TO NOT HAVE TO FILE A EIGHT RETURN FOR THE LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WANT ONE HAVE TO. FILE A FILE IT TURNED PURPOSE OF THE EIGHT PIECE AS IT'S CRAP. IS THE INTENT ON PEOPLE WORKING IF THEY WORK AND HAVE INCOME THAN IT GET A REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THEIR WORK THAT'S IT HE C. SUPPORT THE POSTED VIA. SOME DEBATE WE'VE HAD SOME TO. COUPLE BEERS REGARD THIS OFTEN. WHAT IS SELF EMPLOYED SHE GETS AND YET C. OR NOT WOULD. IT ARE THE IS THAT GONNA BE STUDIED IN THIS- THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE SELF EMPLOYED WHO DON'T HAVE TEN NINETY NINES- WHAT DATE- GET A- A REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT WITHOUT FILING ANY. A TAX RETURN AS WELL SO YOU KNOW HOW HOW DEEP IS THIS GONNA GO. BUT AGAIN IT'S SEVERAL QUESTIONSIN THERE BUT- IF IT'S JUST A STUDY BUILDING- CASE JUST TO STUDY BILL- BUT IT'S ACTUALLY SETTING POLICY- GIVING DIRECTION. AND THEN I'VE GOT SOME CONCERNS. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- MY INTENT ORIGINALLY WAS TO. HAVE THEM FIGURE OUT A WAY TO BE ABLE TO. TO DO IT WITHOUT HAVING TO FILE A TAX RETURN. BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT THE DIFFICULTY OF GIVING THAT KIND OF DIRECTION. WHEN THERE MAY BE OTHER ALTERNATIVES THAT MAKE MORE SENSE AND THERE WERE TWO PURPOSES ACTUALLY ONE IS TO. ENCOURAGE THE SHARING OF INFORMATION BUT DE BETWEEN DEPARTMENTS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN INFORMATION ON. THESE PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS BUT ALSO TO GET THEM THINKING. WHAT ARE THE ALTERNATIVES. THAT MIGHT BE AVAILABLE AND HOW CAN WE ENCOURAGE THAT DIRECTION IT AND PART OF THE REASON IS BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN SPENDING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THE MILLIONS. TRYING TO GET THE WORD OUT AND THE RESEARCH THAT WAS DONE BY THE TIPPING POINT COMMUNITY- WAS THAT DESPITE THE FACT THAT. WE SPENT THAT MONEY. MANY PEOPLE STILL DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S A CREDIT AVAILABLE TO THEM- OR IF THEY DO. IT'S ENOUGH OF A HASSLE TO FILL OUT PAPERWORK. IF YOU DON'T KNOW OUR TAX SYSTEM AND THAT. THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE AFRAID DOING IT THEY JUST DON'T DO IT AND SO THE QUESTION BECOMES YOU KNOW IS WAITING IT MAY BE FOR EXAMPLE. TO PRE FILL OUT A FORM THEY GET SENT TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE TB THINKS MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE AND THAT WOULD BE MAYBE ONE ALTERNATIVE BUT RATHER THAN PRE JUDGING WHAT THE ALTERNATIVES ARE IT'S A STUDY REPORT. HOW WEAK ANDEXT. AND MAKE IT A FOR PEOPLE TO ACCESS THIS THIS BENEFIT THAT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO THAT THEY DON'T THEY MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT. AND DOES IT INCLUDE A SELF EMPLOYED OR WOULD IT JUST BE FOR W. TWO. YOU KNOW IT DOES NOT EXPLICIT IN THE LANGUAGE THOUGH MIKE MY READING OF IT IS THEY WOULD EXPLORE EVERYTHING. AND YOUR COMMENTS QUESTIONS. IN OUR PURVIEW WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE ESSENCE OF THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT OR CHANGING THELANGUAGE ON BY THE INCOME TAX CREDIT IS CURRENTLY PROCESS WE'RE JUST TRYING TO SEE IF THERE IS A WAY FOR THOSE WHO DON'TAND IT'S JUST TRYING TO SEE IF THERE AND IF IT'S THE BEST ALTERNATIVE TO HAVE- A WHETHER IT'S A NO TAX RETURN OR WHATEVER THE POSSIBLE- IMPLEMENTATION WOULD BE SO THAT MORE PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. SO IT'S DONE A BILL THAT IS NOT TING THE ESSENCE OF EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT THEY ARE CONTACT THE IS TRYING TO. SURE THAT ALL THE THAT ARE. ARE GETTING. AND THEN THE THERE'D BE A POLICY WOULD COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT YEAH I JUST WANT TO ASK MAKE THAT ABUNDANTLY YES OR NINE THINK THERE WERE NOT SITTING ANYTHING THIS IS JUST THIS IS A VERY DO LITTLE LITTLE WORK. AND THEN BRING IT BACK RIGHT US TO BE ABLE TO GO IN AND WHETHER WE WOULD SUPPORT- THOSE ONES THAT RESERVATION WAS AND IN THE ORIGINAL BILL IF YOU LOOK AT IT AND HAD NO EIGHT WITH NO INCOME TAX RETURN WE TOOK THAT OUT AND I BELIEVE THE SENATOR IS ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. WE TOOK OUT THAT IT WOULD BE A NO INCOME TAX RETURN BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO GO ABOUT IT SO THIS WOULD BE A STUDY THAT WILL ANALYZE WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF THOSE THAT. THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AS IT STANDS TODAY HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THEY GET IT. IT'S A STUDY BILL OR NOT SETTING POLICY OF THE SUPPORT OF THAT TODAY. CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE QUESTION THAT CLARIFICATION I ASK YOUR- THE MISTRUST CALDERON I BELIEVE WE HAVE A MOTION WE NEED TO SEE. A SECOND BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER PAGE PETRIE-NORRIS.
