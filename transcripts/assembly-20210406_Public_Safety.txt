IN ORDER TO ATTRACT MEANINGFUL POLICY WE MUST RELY ON IN ACCEPTED DATA THAT WE HAVE OR THAT YOU BRING TO THIS COMMITTEE. THE CLAIM THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE COLOR CANNOT MEET EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS SO FAR IT'S BEEN STE PREVENT UNJUSTIFIABLE ASSUMPTION AND FRANKLY AS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MALE FINE TOTALLY OFFENSIVE. INSINUATIONS FROM PARTICULAR STAKEHOLDERS TO RECRUITMENT OF BLACK AND BROWN INDIVIDUALS IS HAMPERED BY HIGHER EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS NOT ONLY MISSES THE MARK ON WHY THOSE INDIVIDUALS DO NOT WANT TO BE.

IF AND WHEN WE INCREASE EDUCATION AND AGE REQUIREMENTS ARE INTENTIONAL ABOUT WHO WE HIRE Â’ RECRUITS OF COLOR. BY HAVING CONVERSATIONS OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS I AM OPEN TO LIST NAME AND WORKING TOGETHER. BUT I WILL NOT BE RECEPTIVE A MISGUIDED ASSERTION THAT MERELY A SUMP GIVE AND NOT DATABASE. WE HAVE TO ACCEPT THE DATA AND ACCEPT THE PREMISE THAT COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE BETTER. WHEN OFFICERS ARE MORE MATURE AND BETTER EDUCATED. BETTER EDUCATED SIGNIFICANTLY. HAVING A MORE MATURE AND BETTER EDUCATED POLICE FORCE WHEN SHORT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WILL NO LONGER LIVE IN TERROR.

WHO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S LIKE TO RECRUIT A PERSON OF COLOR. QUITE FRANKLY SENDING SOMEBODY DOES NOT FROM THE COMMUNITY THAT DOESN'T UNDERSTAND A COMMUNITY CHALLENGES AND THEN TELL THEM. THAT THEY REPRESENT THE COMMUNITY AND THESE ARE THE BEST WAYS THAT THEY NEED TO BE AN OFFICER WHEN IN FACT THE COMMUNITY HAS ASKED FOR CHANGES. THAT IS THE WAY WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD SO WE CAN INCREASE THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS. I REPEAT INDIVIDUALS NO MATTER WHAT COLOR THEY ARE. WHO ARE RECEPTIVE TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES A RECEPTIVE TO PEOPLE OF COLOR AND THEY'RE RECEPTIVE TO THE NEW WAY OF POLICING.

SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN. EXAMPLE IN LA WE EXPANSION OVER 6100% INCREASE IN SHOOTINGS IN SOUTH LA AND JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE OF ALL. CALVET FUNDING HAS BEEN CRITICAL TO ENSURING COMMUNITY SAFETY AND CITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. BONTA INTERVENTION PROGRAMS FUNDED BY CALVET IN CITIES SUCH AS LOS ANGELES OAKLAND STOPPED IN SACRAMENTO HAVE BEEN EVALUATED AND HAVE DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICAN EFFECTIVENESS OF SAVING LIVES. THIS WORK EXPANDS THE STATE'S UNDERSTANDING OF PUBLIC SAFETY BY INVESTING A COMMUNITY BASED SOLUTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE FOR A JOINT USC UCLA EVALUATION OF OUR PREVENTION EFFORTS AND LOS ANGELES. BONTA INTERVENTION WORKERS HAVE DECREASED RETALIATORY VIOLENCE BY 41% OVER TWO YEAR PERIOD IN SOUTH DELHI.

I'M SORRY I'M SORRY OPPOSITION ARE THERE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL I HAVE A DAN READ FROM THE NRA AND MICHAEL FRIEND DALY FROM NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION AGAIN GENTLEMEN I APOLOGIZE YOU YOU MAY BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. MANY FOR THE RECORD DAN READ WESTERN REGIONAL DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION. WRONG OPPOSITION TO DATE YOU AB TWELVE TWENTY THREE. AS YOU HEARD THIS IMPOSES AN EXCISE TAX OF TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS PER FIREARM ON GUNTER'S AS WELL AS AN UNSPECIFIED PERCENTAGE. ON AMMUNITION PURCHASES THIS GOES ON TOP OF THE EXISTING PEACE THAT GUN OWNERS HEY CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE PLACES TO BE A GUN OWNER WITH ALL THE FEES THAT GO INTO IT IN FACT THE FIRST TIME GUN OWNER IS LOOKING AT SOMETHING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD ALMOST SEVENTY DOLLARS IN FEES FOR THEIR FIRST PURCHASE SO- AND THAT'S NOT EVEN INCLUDING STATE AND LOCAL TAXES SO RIGHT NOW THERE'S AN INTERESTING 11% FEDERAL EXCISE TAX ALL. ARMS AND AMMUNITION AND THEN SPECIFIC IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA YOU HAVE A THIRTY ONE DOLLAR NINETEEN CENTRO C. VICO STRICTLY BACKGROUND CHECKS THAT THIS LEGISLATURE JUST RAISED- IN THE LAST TWO YEARS YOU HAVE A ONE DOLLAR CHOIR HE- ACTUALLY OFF FIVE DOLLARS CT. AND FORSMAN B. AND THEN YOU HAVE A TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR FIREARMS SAFETY CERTIFICATE THE THAT'S ONLY GOOD FOR FIVE YEARS AS WELL AS YOUR COSTS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH AMMUNITION ELIGIBILITY CHECKS ONE DOLLAR NINETEEN DOLLARS DEPENDING ON WHETHER YOU'RE GETTING A STANDARD OR BASIC ELIGIBILITY CHECK. IN ADDITION TO STATE LOCAL TAXES SO AT THIS BILL INTO IN A FIRST TIME GOVERNOR IS GOING TO BE LOOKING A CLOSE TO A. HUNDRED DOLLARS THE THIS IS GOING TO. RIGHT OUT MANY OF COMMUNITY. YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO. THEIR CALLS RIGHT BECAUSE OF THIS ADDITIONAL COST BORNE ON THEM- AND- I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT OUR OUR POSITION HERE IS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE COUNTY I. T. PROGRAM BUT- OUR POSITION IS THAT MATTERS OF PUBLIC SAFETY SHOULD BE OF STATEWIDE CONCERN IN PLACE ON THE PUBLIC AT LARGE. AND NOT- ON PERSONS WHO ARE DIFFERENTIATED FROM THE GENERAL PUBLIC ONLY BECAUSE THEY ARE. OF GUN OWNERS ARE OUT THERE EXERCISING THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT SO WE FEEL THAT- IF THE INTENT IS TO FIND A FUNDING SOURCE THAT IS GREAT BUT TO PUT IT ON GUN OWNERS. IT IS UNCONSCIONABLE MISSENSE IN THERE SO MANY EXISTING THE- GUNNERS ARE STRAPPED THERE'S A LOT OF THE THESE ARE GOING TO MANY DOJ PROGRAMS. AS I'VE OUTLINED THESE- ONE STRONG OPPOSITION OF THIS AND- HOST IMPORTANT QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MYSTERY. MISTER BEEN BLOOD. FRIENDLY. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN NUMBERS THAT MANY FOR THE RECORD MY NAME IS MICHAEL FLEMING THE DIRECTOR GOVERNMENT RELATIONS WITH THE NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION AND WE STAND IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWELVE TWENTY THREE TODAY I WANT TO ECHO A LOT OF THE COMMENTS THE DAN BREEN MADE EARLIER AND ADD TO- I WANT TO BRING YOUR ATTENTION TO A RECENT REPORT AND THIS IS IN MY ROOM WRITTEN- TESTIMONY THAT I PROVIDED THE COMMITTEE. IT WAS RELEASED BY THE US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WHICH OUTLINES THE ONLY TWO POINT 3% OF VIOLENT CRIMES STATE AND FEDERAL INVOLVED FIREARM TAPE FROM A RETAIL STORE IN FACT CRIMINALS OF ALL TYPES ARE LIKELY TO USE A FIREARM PURCHASED AT A RETAILER ONLY ONE POINT 3% CRIME STATE AND FEDERAL INVOLVED A FIREARM OBTAINED BY A CRIMINAL FROM A RETAIL STORE. WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT LAW FOR PERSONS WITH PASSED THE CRIMINAL AND MENTAL HISTORY A HISTORY BACKGROUND CHECK AND WE HAVE UNDERGONE A MANDATORY TEN DAY WAITING PERIOD IN CALIFORNIA ARE NOT PROHIBITED FROM PROTESTS ARE POSSESSING A FIREARM AND ARE NOT THE SOURCE THE VIOLENCE INVOLVING FIREARMS YES THEY SHOULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO PAY FOR PROGRAMS THAT ARE STATUS DEAL WITH VIOLENCE NOT ENGAGED IN BY THEM BUT COMMITTED BY OTHERS FOR INSTANCE CRIMINALS AND THE MENTALLY ILL. IF THE MOTIVATION BEHIND AB TWELVE TWENTY THREE IS BASED ON THE THEORY THAT BALANCE WOULD SOMEHOW BE REDUCED TO FARMS- PRICE THREE TAXATION ADDED THE BUDGET UP A LARGE SEGMENT OF THE CALIFORNIA POPULATION THAT IS DESTINED FOR FAILURE SINCE THE INCREASED COSTS WOULD HAVE NO EFFECT. ON THE LEVEL OF VIOLENCE IN OUR SOCIETY THIS IS TRUE BECAUSE CRIMINALS WILL HAVE OTHER AND LESS EXPENSIVE MEANS OF ACQUIRING A FIREARM SUCH AS THROUGH THAT THE UNDERGROUND MARKET IN FACT 43% OF OFFENDERS ACQUIRE FIREARMS FROM THE UNDERGROUND. MARKET 6% OBTAINED A FIRE THREE THESE THOSE THAT HAVE IT USE A FIREARM VIOLENCE. SEVEN THREE CAN. IN THE CRY. GIVEN THAT CRIMINALS WHILE CRIME. NOT TEAM. FARMS SMALL FULL REPEAL SOURCE. IF SOMEONE THIS TACK WILL EVER BE RENDERED AGAINST CRIMES VENDORS- WE HAVE A LOT MORE SANDERS BUT AGAIN I'D LIKE TO ECHO DAN READ COMMENTS AND I WERE AT THE TIME. WE ARE IN OPPOSITION OF TWELVE TWENTY THREE AND WOULD STAND FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD HAVE. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR ARE THERE- ANY OTHER.

WE SEE HAVE MISTER CAR AB SIX FIVE FIVE- CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT ACCOUNTABILITY REFORM ACT. PLEASE. TAKE YOUR TIME IS. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. EXTREMISM RACISM ANIMUS HAVE NO PLACE AMONG LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES CAN ONLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE EROSION OF PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN LEGITIMACY. EMBARRASSED OF OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM. AB FIFTY BY THE CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT ACCOUNTABILITY REFORM ACT FOR THE CLEAR OFF. FULL CLARA COMMONSENSE REALLY LIMITED PRE EMPLOYMENT SCREENING FOR KNOWN PARTICIPATION WITH VIOLENT HATE GROUPS. THAT IS AN EXTREMELY SIMPLE TRADITIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IS ABUNDANT. ASIDE FROM THE APPALLING INSURRECTION THE U. S. CAPITAL. WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF SOME IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. CALIFORNIA'S OWN PLEASE APARTMENTS HAVE BEEN PLAYING WITH CANDLES OF OFFICERS PRESSING. RACIST HOMOPHOBIC OR THREATENING MESSAGES OVER SOCIAL MEDIA. OFFICERS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED A RALLIES ORGANIZED BY WHITE SUPREMACIST GROUPS. AND EXPRESSED VIEWS LATELY ON SOCIAL MEDIA. AND IT FOR THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITIES THEY ARE SWORN TO PROTECT. THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN ON THE RADAR OF THE FBI WHICH WAS IDENTIFIED ORGANIZATIONS OVER THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS. HAS IDENTIFIED ORGANIZATIONS COMMITTED TO DOMESTIC TERORISM THAT INCLUDE MILITIA EXTREMISTS. AND WHITE SUPREMACISTS EXTREMISTS WITH ACTIVE LINKS LAW ENFORCEMENT. WITHOUT ANY COORDINATED BETTER RESPONSES PROBLEM ISSUE STATE ACTION IS LONG OVERDUE. THE CLEAR RECOGNIZES NUANCES IN A PEACE OFFICER'S AFFILIATION TO HATE GROUPS AND OF A COMPLAINT ALLEGING UP THREATENING OR VIOLENT BEHAVIOR IS FILED. AGAINST KERN OFFICER. AN INVESTIGATION WILL BE TRIGGERED A COULD BE GROUNDS FOR. TERMINATION IF SUSTAIND. WE WERE THOUGHT FOR PERSONAL PROTECTION THIS BILL IN THE CLEAR ACT BUILDS UP EXISTING ABILITIES BY THE STATE TO LIMIT PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES IF SOMEONE SPEECH COULD INTERFERE THE DUTIES OF THE JOB. LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND MUST HAVE THE TRUST OF THE PUBLIC TO DO THEIR JOBS SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY. HOWEVER THE IMPORTATION OF VIOLENT EXTREMISTS AND LACK OF FEDERAL OR STATE ACTION ON THIS GOING ISSUE HAS LED TO A SERIOUS OR RELIGION. PUBLIC TRUST. TO ADDRESS CONCERNS OF THE DEPOSITIONS COULD APPLY TO A PERSON'S RELIGIOUS OR POLITICAL AFFILIATIONS THE BILL'S HATE GROUP DEFINITION WAS AMENDED. TO REMOVE DENIAL OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. IT WAS NEVER THE INTENT TO PREVENT PEOPLE WITH FAITH BASED OR CONSERVATIVE VIEWS FROM BECOMING LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. AND I AND I THINK THOSE THAT RAISE THAT ISSUE AS- WE ALL KNOW- THE FIRST VERSION OF BILL B. HE KEPT INFORMED WHEN ISSUES ARISE AND THAT WAS CERTAINLY WHEN THERE'S WAS A LEGITIMATE ONE. AND AGAIN WAS NEVER THE INTENTION TO HAVE THAT TYPE OF IMITATION. ADDITIONALLY THE BILL WAS AMENDED TO SET A LIMITED TIME FRAME. FOR THE BACKGROUND CHECKS TO NARROW THE SCOPE THOSE OFFICERS THAT MAY POSE A MORE IMMINENT DANGER TO PUBLIC SAFETY. EVERYONE HAS A RIGHT. TO REDEMPTION AND THE OPPORTUNITY. TO SHOW AND TO PROVE THAT- THEY HAVE CHANGED THEIR VIEWS AND I THINK THAT SHOULD APPLY TO THOSE THAT HAVE AN INTEREST IN ENTERING THE FIELD ALONG FOR SOME. RENDON IDENTIFIES SPECIFIC GROUPS THE BILL'S TRIGGERED BY DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOR THAT CAN BE INDICATIVE OF FUTURE VIOLENCE TOWARDS NUMBER THE PUBLIC. MEMBERS THE PUBLIC MEMBERS OF OTHER GROUPS. BUT THE PROBLEM ISN'T LITERALLY THE KKK HAVE NO PLACE. IN A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ATTAIN A BATCH OF THE AUTHORITY. AND POWER THAT COMES WITH IT. THE CLERK WILL PROPERLY SCREEN CANDIDATES AND EMPOWER PEOPLE TO HOLD LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ACCOUNTABLE. WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH FUNCTIONAL LANGUAGE AND DISCUSSING HOW TO ACHIEVE THE SHARED GOALS OF THIS MEASURE. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS DR WILLIAM ARE MINE THE DIRECTOR OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS INSTITUTE AT CELLS ARE STATE UNIVERSITY. AND RUN ROUTE THE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION THANK YOU. AT&amp;T OPERATOR WHENEVER THE WITNESSES ARE READY TO TESTIFY. AIRLINES ARE OPEN. HELLO THIS IS WILL ARLENE CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN GO AHEAD PROFESSOR. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS WILL LIKELY MARLENE ON THE FOUNDING DIRECTOR OF THE SENATE THE STATE UNIVERSITY HUMAN RIGHTS INSTITUTE. WE WERE APPROACHED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN BY OUR COLLEAGUES THE CINEMA COUNTY HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION FOR HELP AFTER THEY RECEIVED NUMEROUS REPORTS OF POLICE BRUTALITY RACIAL PROFILING ARBITRARY STOPS THERE WERE OFTEN ACCOMPANIED BY RACIAL SLURS. AND ALL PUBLIC REFERENCES TO WHITE NATIONALISM FORTUNATELY WE'RE ARE YOU RESEARCHING AT LEAST FIFTEEN YEARS OF REPORTS FROM THE FBI OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST IDENTIFIED ORGANIZATIONS COMMITTED TO DOMESTIC TERRORISM THAT INCLUDE MILITIA WHAT'S PROMISES AND SOVEREIGN CITIZEN EXTREMISTS THAT HAVE ACTIVE LINKS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. THIS INFILTRATION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A HUMAN RIGHTS CRISIS IN UNITED STATES. BRITAIN'S THE INTEGRITY OF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS AND LEGITIMATE AUTHORITY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT THREATENS THE PUBLIC SAFETY OF THOSE TARGETED BY SUCH ORGANIZATIONS THAT ALL BUT GUARANTEES DISCRIMINATORY APPLICATION OF LAWS AND PROVISION OF SERVICES IN VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS TREATIES RATIFIED BY THE UNITED STATES. AND REPRESENTS A MANCHESTER UP TO BE CONSTITUTIONAL AND HUMAN RIGHTS EQUAL PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW. ACCORDING TO AREA EXPERT MICHAEL GERMAN FROM THE FRONT AND CENTER OF JUSTICE AND FORMER FBI SPECIAL AGENT ON DOMESTIC TERROR AND COVERT OPERATIONS MANY OF YOU ACTUALLY SEE HIM ON TELEVISION AND GIVING SORT CONGRESSIONAL TESTIMONY ON THIS ISSUE. THE MOST EFFECTIVE IN ASSISTANCE QUOTE AND I QUOTE THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO RESTORE PUBLIC TRUST INTERNET RACES WORKMAN PUBLISHING LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS IS TO PROHIBIT INDIVIDUALS WERE MEMBERS OF WHITE SUPREMACIST GROUPS TROUBLED REGISTRY THAT SPLITS THE RACIST CONDUCT FROM BECOMING LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IN THE FIRST PLACE ORANGE FOR WAR FROM REMAINING OFFICERS ONCE DEMONSTRATED. AND QUOTE THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE CORRECTIVE DESIGNED TO ACCOMPLISH IN ALL THE WAYS DESCRIBED BY SOME MEMBER KALRA MOMENT AGO. THE CORRECT WILL NOT PRESENT A CHALLENGE THE CIVIL LIBERTIES OF PEACE OFFICERS OR BOARD OR OTHER PUBLIC EMPLOYEES NORSE THE CURBING OF ANY EXISTING CONSTITUTIONAL HUMAN RIGHT THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL. IN FACT ACCORDING TO RESEARCH MORE RESEARCH FROM THE BRENNAN CENTER FOR JUSTICE QUOTE MOST COURTS HAVE UPHELD DISMISSALS OF POLICE OFFICERS TO AFFILIATED WITH. RACES ARE MILITANT GROUPS FOLLOWING SUPREME COURT JUSTICE LIMITING FREE SPEECH RIGHTS FOR. COOLEY SOME MANNERS OF PUBLIC AND- THANK ARE GIVEN LONG FOR. AGENCY EVEN CALL A LOT OF RESEARCH TEACHING SO. SENT A QUOTE HI NEED FOR ORDER OF CHANGE. AND HARMONY SHE SHOULD FIND BE NOTED HERE THAT TALKS ARE UNIQUE FROM ALL OF TYPES OF PUBLIC AND- IN THEIR ACCESS TO THE STATE. NOT ON THE USE OF FORCE IN A PARTICULAR ROLE IN EXECUTING THE RULE OF LAW. FOR THIS REASON IS CRITICAL TO PEACE OFFICERS BE HELD TO THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS. IN THEIR ABILITY TO RESPECT AND PROTECT ALL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. THANK YOU VERY MUCH COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU NEXT. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS RON RAPP SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF AB SIX FIVE FIVE WE'RE PROUD TO CO SPONSOR THIS IMPORTANT BILL THAT WILL COMBAT THE INFILTRATION OF EXTREMIST SOME LAW ENFORCEMENT WE LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE THE IMPLICATION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES BY EXTREMIST ORGANIZATIONS THREATENS THE INTEGRITY INTEGRITY OF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS JEOPARDIZES THE SAFETY OF ELECTED OFFICIALS PEACE OFFICERS AND THE PUBLIC AND INVITE BIASED AND DISCRIMINATORY APPLICATION OF LOG SERVICES. THE JANUARY SIXTH INSURRECTION AT THE U. S. CAPITOL BUILDING BY RIGHT WING EXTREMISTS WITH THE APPARENT COOPERATION PARTICIPATION AND SUPPORT OF SOME LAW ENFORCEMENT AND MILITARY PERSONNEL UNDERSCORES THE THREAT THAT EXTREMISTS AMPLE INFILTRATION POSES TO EQUAL JUSTICE AND THE RULE OF LAW CFA BELIEVES THAT AB SIX FIVE FIVE WILL INCREASE PUBLIC TRUST IN LAW ENFORCEMENT BY ROOTING OUT THOSE WHO WOULD JEOPARDIZE PUBLIC SAFETY WITH EXTREMISM AND VIOLENT BEHAVIOR IT IS FOR THESE REASONS THAT WE ARE A PROUD CO SPONSOR OF EIGHTY SIX FIVE FIVE. AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST. YOUR VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. UNDER ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT INDIE HEARING ROOM ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT ON THE TELE CONFERENCING. AT&amp;T OPERATOR ON BABY THINK THAT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO SHOW SUPPORT FOR EIGHTY SIX FIVE FIVE PRESS ONE THEN THERE ARE NOW AGAIN ONE THEN ZERO NOW TO SHOW SUPPORT. AT THIS TIME THERE'S NO ONE ON THE LINE. THANK YOU ARE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION HI I HAVE A KEVIN SNYDER PACIFIC JUSTICE INSTITUTE- OPERATOR DO YOU HAVE THAT PERSON ONLINE. YES. IT KEVIN SNYDER CAN YOU HEAR ME I SURE CAN BEGIN. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS KEVIN SNYDER OF PACIFIC JUSTICE INSTITUTE CENTER FOR PUBLIC POLICY WHERE I SERVED AS CHIEF COUNSEL THIS AFTERNOON I SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT ACCOUNTABILITY REFORM ACT UNLESS FURTHER AMENDED- FIRST WILL CALL THE OFFICE RECENT AMENDMENT TO STRIKE OUT THE LANGUAGE WHICH STATES THAT AN APPLICANT FOR POSITION. BUT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS DISQUALIFIED FOR ADVOCATING AND SUPPORTING THE DENIAL OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PERSONS BELONGING TO A PROTECTED CLASS. THE IRONY IS THAT THIS LANGUAGE THAT HE HAS JUST STRICKEN AIMED AT PROTECTING CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS WHICH WOULD HAVE EXPLICITLY DENIED RIGHT SECURED UNDER THE FIRST AMENDMENT THE AUTHORS CHANGE WAS ONE STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. BUT REGRETTABLY IN THE LAST THE LATEST VERSION DOES NOT SURE ALL THE DEFECTS AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED THE BILL CLAIMS TO ASSURE PROPER CANDIDATES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND REMOVAL OF THOSE UNFIT FOR SERVICE BUT THE MEANS BY WHICH IS SIX THOSE DANCES TO EMPLOY THE USE OF THE TERM EXPRESSION OF HATE. TO CREATE GUILT BY ASSOCIATION AND IDEOLOGICAL. DISQUALIFICATION BILL WOULD FURTHER THE OF JUST. TO PROMULGATE RULES FOR THE INVESTIGATION OF WHAT AMOUNTS TO FIGHT CRIME. USE OF THE DOJ FOR INVESTIGATING AND ADJUDICATING EXPRESSIONS OF HATE BUT IRONICALLY NOT PROMOTE THE WILL OF LAW BUT INSTEAD LAID THE FOUNDATION FOR POLICE STATE. RELATED TO THIS IS THE LIMITATION OF PROTECTIONS TO PERSONS BELONGING TO CERTAIN CLASSES RACE ETHNICITY NATIONALITY. RELIGION GENDER GENDER IDENTITY SEXUAL ORIENTATION DISABILITY. OUR POSITION IS THAT VIOLENCE OR THE SOLICITATION OF VIOLENCE AGAINST SUCH PERSONS BECAUSE OF THE THEIR ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED MEMBERSHIP IN SUCH CLASSES AS GROUNDS FOR DISQUALIFICATION TO SERVE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. BUT IN THAT SENSE THE CLEAR ACTORS TO NARROW THOSE ARE NOT THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO MERIT LEGAL PROTECTION. ALL CITIZENS IN THE STATE DESERVE TO BE PROTECTED. LANGUAGE REGARDING HATE GROUPS THE EXPRESSIONS OF HATE AND THE LIKE SHOULD BE STRICKEN FROM THE BILL AS WELL AS IDENTIFYING CERTAIN GROUPS OF THE SOLE BENEFICIARIES PROTECTION. WE WOULD URGE THAT THE BILL BE SIMPLIFIED IN BROADENED WITH THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE. NO PERSON CAN SERVE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO ENGAGES AN ADVOCATE OR THREATENED UNLAWFUL VIOLENCE AGAINST. ANY PERSON.

CLARIFYING AMENDMENT THAT- INITIALLY TRIGGERED NATIONAL ALARM AND ALL TRUE. AND I THINK I KNOW. I THINK YOU GOT THAT SO YEAH WE GREATLY APPRECIATE IT- YOU TAKING THAT AMENDMENT AND LET ME ALSO STATE THAT THERE'S NO ROOM FOR HATE GROUPS SUPPORTERS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT SHE FULLY HAVE MY SUPPORT ON THAT BUT I STILL. WOOD RESERVE MY SUPPORT ENTER YOUR MANAGE AS STATED BY THE- EARLIER OPPOSITION. THE THE EXPRESSION OF HATE IS TOO BROAD TOO VAGUE. AND I THINK COULD MISS BE MISINTERPRETED. AND I THINK IT'S VERY VERY DANGEROUS AND IT'S A THREAT TO FIRST AMENDMENT- PROTECTIONS AND SO I'M NOT FULLY READY TO SUPPORTYOUR BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM. BUT I CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE FACT THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GET RID OF. AND GET IN STATUTE THAT THE THERE'S NO ROOM FOR HATE GROUPS SUPPORTERS LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE YOU YOU HAVE MY FULL BACKING ON THAT FRONT. END TO THE CHAIR THANK YOU SO MUCH AS A MEMBER A LACKEY- AND YES IT CAN BE CHALLENGING TO MAKE THOSE DETERMINATIONS ARE COURSE MICHAEL'S TERMINATIONS. CONSTANTLY THERE IS HATE CRIME LEGISLATION THIS HATE CRIME YOU KNOW STATUES THAT GET INTERPRETED BY PROSECUTORS GET INTERPRETED BY COURTS BY JUDGES BY JURIES BY PAUL COURTS AND SO YES IT IS CHALLENGING CAN BE CHALLENGING BUT- AT THE FBI'S INDICATED DURING THEIR- EXHAUSTIVE INVESTIGATION INTO THESE ISSUES. THAT THERE IS A WAY TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION BUT YOU'RE RIGHT YOU ALWAYS MUST BE CAUTIOUS I DO APPRECIATE ARMY YOU'RE YOU'RE VERY VOCAL SUPPORT IN THE OBJECTIVE. MR BURKE CHAU ON WITH MR LACKEY I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT NOW UNLESS YOU AGREE RECENT CHANGES. MY CONCERN IS THAT MERE MEMBERSHIP IS GROUNDS FOR NOT BEING HIRED. SOMETHING COULD HAVE HAPPENED SIX YEARS EARLIER. FRANKLY YOU'RE A DIFFERENT PERSON BETWEEN EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY FOUR. BUT EVEN BEYOND THAT THE IDEA OF USING MEMBERSHIP. IS JUST REPORTING THAT. THIS SMACKS OF THE MCCARTHYISM YOU PROBABLY ALL SEEN THE CLIP OF MCCARTY BEING TOLD HAVE YOU NO SHAME AT LONG LAST SIR HAVE YOU NO SHAME THAT'S BECAUSE- KARTI WAS GOING AFTER ONE OF WELCH'S PERSON SAID THIS THE OTHER. ARMY LAWYER. GOING AFTER BECAUSE YOU BELONG TO THE NATIONAL LAWYERS GUILD WHICH WE ALL KNOW IS A NON PROFIT IT HELPS IN THE GRAND SAID CETERA ETCETERA. AT ANY RATE- BECAUSE IT WAS ON THE LIST HI THE ATTORNEY GENERAL- MCCARTHY WITH JUST ONE AFTERNOON WHEN AFTER. AND YOU KNOW I JUST THAT PART OF THE BILL JUST DRIVES ME CRAZY. SO IF YOU'RE WILLING TO TAKE OUT THE MEMBERSHIP CARDS. AND JUST GO ON HOW PEOPLE ACT. THEN I'M OKAY I THINK THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE POSITION OF THE OPPOSITION OF MR LANKY BUT WHEN YOU GET INTO THE MEMBERSHIP FIGHT I JUST CAN'T SUPPORT. I'M OF THE APPRECIATE THE FEEDBACK WE ARE WORKING WITH- GROUPS INCLUDING DELIBERATE PLEASE TACKLE IT WILL BE MEETING WITH THEM BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE SOME. ADDITIONAL CONCERNS THAT WE'RE COMMITTED TO THESE TRYING TO WORK ON I WILL SAY THAT LOOK YOU KNOW THIS IS FOCUSED ON- GROUPS- THAT ACTUALLY THREATENED PHYSICAL VIOLENCE LIKE I SAID THE FBI HAS BEEN ABLE TO. IDENTIFY GROUPS- THAT INCLUDES IT EXTREMIST GROUPS THIS IS NOT. COMPLETELY YOU KNOW JUST A- A SUBJECTIVE WHAT TYPE OF MEASUREMENT AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE. YOU KNOW SOMEONE- IS A MEMBER OF THE KKK I THINK THAT'S A PROBLEM IF THEY WANT TO BE A LAW ENFORCEMENT FRANKLY- AND AGAIN THAT THERE'S A REASON WHY WE ALSO GOT RID OF THE- DEBT THE% TIMELESSNESS OF IT. AND MADE SEVEN YEARS AND I THINK THAT THAT AT LEAST GIVES A PERIOD OF TIME WHERE. YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME SEPARATION FROM ANY AFFILIATION- UP BECAUSE TO YOUR POINT I THINK THAT BEFORE THAT IN THE ORIGINAL WRITING OF THE BILL DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING ON THE TIMELINESS OF IT SO COULD HAVE BEEN TWENTY YEARS EARLIER. OR TEN FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS EARLIER EVERYTHING JUST LIKE ALL THIS LIKE MANY OF US WORK- AND BELIEVE IN REDEMPTION FOR THOSE THAT. GET CAUGHT UP IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM SOME AT LEAST ONCE GOING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT FOR THAT REDUCTION AS WELL AS US MNEY BUT THAT TIME I AM WILLING TO CONCEDE THAT YOU CAN DETERMINE WHAT I HATE GROUP IS. I THINK MERE MEMBERSHIP. DISQUALIFY YOU. ROOMS FOR REASON FOR NOT BEING HIRED. IS JUST. APPROPRIATE WHAT WAS YOUR- OKAY AND THEN ITS GROUNDS AND SO- IF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY DOING THE HIRING. FEELS THAT SIMPLY. JUST THE MEMBERSHIP SIX AND A HALF YEARS EARLIER. BUT THOSE ARE NOT GROUNDS FOR TERMINATION OF FOR NOT HIRING SOMEONE. THAT'S UNDER DISCUSSION AS WELL. I JUST SAY IT SHOULD NOT BE CRITERIA. PERIOD THANK YOU JUST A- ARE ANY MARK QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YOU MAY CLOSE OR WAS THAT YOUR CLOTHES. I REALLY APPRECIATE THE FEEDBACK AND LIKE I SAID YOU KNOW THE WE DID JUST TAKE A MEDIA- AS IMMEDIATE AS POSSIBLE AMENDMENTS- TO DEAL WITH THE MOST OF. THE MOST ONEROUS CONCERNS WHICH I AGREED WITH- IN TERMS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL. ISSUES ARE AND AS STATED IN THE- IN THE VERY WELL WRITTEN BILL ANALYSIS. THAT THE LIMITATIONS THAT NOW EXIST. IN TERMS OF PERSONNEL IMITATIONS AS- WRITTEN IN THE BILL ARE WELL WITHIN THE POWERS OF. OF GOVERNMENT PARTICULARLY FOR A ROLE LIKE POLICE OFFICER WITHOUT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE SO THANK YOU. WE NEED A MOTION AND A SECOND. THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU MISTER CARR I DO BELIEVE THIS IS A IMPORTANT I WISH YOU WILL CLARIFY- BUT I THE ONLY WARNING I WOULD GIVE IN THIS IS WHERE I MAY DIFFER WITH SOME OF THE MEMBERS HERE- IF YOU'RE A MEMBER OF Q. ANON AND YOU BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE OF JEWISH FAITH HAVE A LASER FROM SPACE. THAT HAS STARTED TO WILDFIRES HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE MAY WANT TO REALLY TALK TO THAT INDIVIDUAL ABOUT BEING IN LAW ENFORCEMENT IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE TO BE A MEMBER TO KKK YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE HOLOCAUST EXISTED I THINK WE HAVE TO HELP FURTHER DISCUSSION WITH THAT INDIVIDUAL WHO IS A MEMBER OF THAT BEFORE THEY BECOME SO I I'VE I'VE I DON'T THINK THEY DISAGREE WITH. THAT IT'S IS WHETHER OR NOT YOU KNOW YOU'RE USED TO LIKE WE HAVE LAWS THAT IF USED TO BE A GANG MEMBER YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOW BEEN OUT FOR FIVE KID ELEVEN YEARS WE WANT TO PAROLED EARLIER BECAUSE THEY'RE NO LONGER THAT. THEY GAIN MEMBERS I'D BE IN THAT YEAH PROBABLY IN THAT VEIN- IF YOU WORK THROUGH THAT I THANK YOU YOU MAY EVEN GET UNANIMOUS SUPPORT SO TEXTURES RECOMMEND AND I BOTH. THANK YOU.

THANK YOU MISTER SB THIRTY EIGHT BRINGS BECAUSE IN ORDER TO K. MESSY BILL SYSTEM THE SAME TIME THE DRESSES ISSUE OF BILLS STACKING BOTH OF WHICH CAN BE DEVELOPMENTS BEING INCONSISTENT UNREASONABLE AND UNFAIR. EVERY YEAR SUPERIOR COURT JUDGES IN EACH COUNTY PREPARE AND ADOPT A UNIFORM COUNTYWIDE BILL SCHEDULE FOR ALL FELONY AND MISDEMEANOR OFFENSES THIS CREATES FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT BILL SCHEDULES WHICH ROUTINELY TO DIFFERENT BILL AMOUNTS FOR THE SAME CHARGES EVEN IN NEIGHBORING COUNTIES. AS AN EXAMPLE THE NEIGHBORING COUNTIES OF ALAMEDA AND SAN FRANCISCO HAVE DIFFERENT BILL SCHEDULES FOR THE CHARGES OF LEWD ACTS ON A CHILD HUNDRED KILOMETER UNDER FIFTY K. IN SAN FRANCISCO SELL THE DEADLY WEAPON THIRTY K. AND ALAMEDA FIFTY K. AND- SAN FRANCISCO ARMED ROBBERY FIFTY K. IN. ALAMEDA THIRTY FIVE K. IN SAN FRANCISCO HEY THREATS. FIFTY K. AND- ELAM. FIFTY FIVE K. SAN FRANCISCO AND CHILD ABANDONMENT TWENTY KILOMETER INSTANCES GO TEN K. FOR BIGGER COUNTIES- WITH LIKE POPULATIONS- FOR RELAX ON CHILDREN SAN DIEGO TWO HUNDRED K. SAMBAR DEALS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS- I'LL TELL YA IF YOU LOOK AT THE BIGGEST THING ON HERE THAT THE GLARES AT ME AS ROBBERY. ARMED ROBBERY IS THE TAKING OF PERSONAL PROPERTY TO THE USE OF FORCE OR FEAR SO ON THE BEACH UP I'VE GOT A GUN I'M GONNA ROB YOU SO RODRIGUEZ ROBIN ABOUT- WHAT THE PENAL CODE AND IT GOES FROM TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS AND SAMPOERNA DINO. ALL THE DATA FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN ALAMEDA IT'S THE SAME CRIME THAT'S WE'VE BEEN A BIG ISSUE AND I KNOW A LOT OF FOLKS HAVE IDEAS ABOUT THIS BILL OF STUFF IS ACTUALLY PROGRESSIVE BUT THERE REALLY SHOULD BE A UNIFORM BELL SCHEDULE ONE. YOU FOR BILLS BECAUSE IN CALIFORNIA WERE SET AT ONE BILL THE MATTER WHAT. THAT'S REASON I INTRODUCED THIS BILL- THIS IS AN EQUITY PROBLEM THAT JUDGES WILL FIX IN AB THIRTY EIGHT DOES FIX SB THIRTY EIGHT ALSO ALLOWS THE STATE JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO REDUCE EXISTING BILL ON EVERY OFFENSE UP TO HALF OF THE EXISTING MONETARY VALUE TO PROMOTE EVEN MORE FAIRNESS OF CAST BILL AB THIRTY EIGHT REPLACE THE CURRENT PRACTICE OF BILLS STACKING. IN SOME COUNTIES BILL US DIRECTLY PERSONS ACCUSED OF MULTIPLE OFFENSES OR STACK BECAUSE OF ENHANCEMENTS LIKE PRIOR CONVICTIONS THIS MEANS ALL SCHEDULE BILL AMOUNTS FOR EACH CHARGE. ARE ADDED TOGETHER. TOGETHER JAIL PRE TRIAL THE ACCUSED POST MUST POST A SOME OF ALL THESE AMOUNTS WHICH CAN BE EXORBITANT. SB THIRTY EIGHT WILL LIMIT BILL STACKING TO MAKE IT FAIR AND MORE EQUITABLE ESPECIALLY WITH THOSE DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES OTHERS. THESE ARE NOT STATUS QUO REFORMS.THERE IS A REAL REFORMS THAT WILL LOWER BILL IMMEDIATELY AND NOT BE DEPENDENT ON THE SUBJECT OF PROCESS. OF A BILL HEARINGS. AND THAT'S THE END OF MY PRESENTATION MISTER CHAIR. I DO HAVE A WITNESSES IN SUPPORT THAT I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I DON'T I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ON HERE IS TO MAKE SURE I DIDN'T MISS ANYTHING THAT'S CORRECT THERE ARE NONE GETTING IN THE ROOM RT.

GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THIS IS LARRY MORSE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB THIRTY EIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO OTHERS IN THE QUEUE THIS TIME ALL RIGHT THANK YOU NOW HEAR FROM WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION- I HAVE MARGO GEORGE SHE PDA. M. D'AMICO ROSARIO SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE. GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS MARCO GEORGE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION REGRETTABLY WE MUST OPPOSE AB THIRTY EIGHT AB THIRTY EIGHT S. MOST LIKELY UNCONSTITUTIONAL BECAUSE IT KEEPS PEOPLE IN JAIL MERELY BECAUSE THEY ARE POOR IT IS FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR AND HARKS BACK TO THE FAILED PUBLIC POLICY THAT RESULTED IN MASS INCARCERATION. AT THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT NOTED LAST WEEK IN THE HOUSE THE HUMPHREYRELYING ON A HARVARD LAW SCHOOL STUDY GROWTH IN PRE TRIAL DETENTION WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALTERNET JAIL POPULATION GROWTH IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. HIGHLIGHTING THE COST TO THE COMMUNITY THE HUMPHREY COURT ALSO NOTED THAT JUST SIX CALIFORNIA COUNTIES ALAMEDA FRESNO OUR INTEREST SACRAMENTO SAN BERNARDINO AND SAN FRANCISCO SPENT OVER THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ON IT OVER TWO YEAR PERIOD HOUSING AND FEEDING PRE TRIAL DETAINEES WHO WERE NEVER CHARGED OR HAD THEIR CASES DISMISSED. THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ESTIMATE FOR KEEPING THE PRE TRIAL POPULATION BEHIND BARS COST AMERICAN TAXPAYERS ROUGHLY NINE BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. AB THIRTY EIGHT WON'T WASTE CALIFORNIA'S ALREADY HIGH BAIL AMOUNTS FOR MOST PRINTOUT DETAINEES AND WILL DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT POOR PEOPLE PRIMARILY BROWN OR BLACK OR ALREADY MOST LIKELY TO BE ARRESTED FOR MINOR OFFENSES. BECAUSE IT'S A BILL SCHEDULE INTO SENDING MONEY BAIL THAT IS MORE THAN ZERO WHEN THE INDIVIDUAL IS FIRST ARRESTED. THEY ARE POTENTIALLY GOING TO LOSE THEIR HOUSING THEY'RE JOHN PERHAPS SENDING THEIR FAMILY ANNOUNCED INTO THE STREET. THE HUMP RECORD ALSO NOTEDTHAT BLACK ADULTS IN SAN FRANCISCO ARE ONLY ELEVEN TIMES AS LIKELY AS WHITE ADULTS TO BE BOOKED INTO THE COUNTY JAIL PRIOR TO TRIAL. I WAS A PUBLIC DEFENDER FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS I HAD NUMEROUS CLIENTS SIMPLE YEARS I CALLED TRYING TO STATE THEIR JOBS WHILE MY CLIENTS COULDN'T AFFORD. FIVE THOUSAND TEN THOUSAND FIFTEEN THOUSAND OR TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLAR BAIL FOR MISDEMEANORS. EVEN LOSING A WEEK'S PAY THAT DEVASTATION AND HOMELESSNESS FOR MANY OF MY CLIENTS. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR NOTEBOOK THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF HIS D'AMICO REGARD KNOWLEDGE STATE POLICY DIRECTOR FOR THE SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC DEFENDER THOUGHT THAT. PRIOR TO MY CURRENT POSITION I ESTABLISH THE MALE CLINIC AT LAWYERS COMMITTEE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS WHICH PIONEERED THE APPLICATION OF CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS THE BAYLON IMMIGRATION BOND INDUSTRIES. AND PROVIDED FREE LEGAL SERVICES PEOPLE WITH CONSUMER JUSTICE SESSION STEMMING FROM THEIR USE OF BAIL AND IMMIGRATION BOND SERVICES. AB THIRTY EIGHT MAY APPEAR TO BE IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE AFRICAN BAIL REFORM IN THE STATE. BUT AS USUAL THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS. FIRST NOTHING IN AB THIRTY EIGHT PROTECTS AGAINST UNAFFORDABLE BAIL AMOUNTS CONTINUING TO BE FAT A WIDE. HAPPY EVEN MORE NOTABLY THE MOST LIKELY TO BENEFIT FROM THE CHANGES PROPOSED BY AB THIRTY EIGHT IS THE BAIL BONDS INDUSTRY. THE BAIL INDUSTRY HAS ADVOCATED FOR A STATEWIDE BAIL SCHEDULE BECAUSE LOWER AVAIL AMOUNTS ARE ACTUALLY IN THEIR FAVOR. DUE TO CALIFORNIA'S EXTREMELY HIGH BAIL AMOUNTS BAIL BOND COMPANIES HAVE BEEN FORCED TO SHIFT THEIR ENTIRE BUSINESS MODEL AND NOW ROUTINELY OFFER CREDIT BAIL BECAUSE PEOPLE CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY THE 10% PREMIUM VIA THE BAIL BONDS INDUSTRY CHARGES UP FRONT. THEREFORE THE BAIL BOND INDUSTRY FREQUENTLY FINANCES THEIR BAIL BOND AGREEMENT BREAKING UP THE DEBT AND THE PAYMENTS TO BE MADE OVER TIME. THIS IS PUT THEM IN THE POSITION OF BECOMING DEBT COLLECTION AGENCIES AND THEY OFTEN HAVE DIFFICULTY FULLY COLLECTING OUTSTANDING DEBT BECAUSE THE AMOUNTS ARE SO ASTRONOMICALLY HIGH. BUT PEOPLE DIFFERENTLY CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY THEM. SO IN THE INDUSTRY BACK IN A STATEWIDE BAIL SCHEDULE THAT ESTABLISHES SLIGHTLY LOWER BAIL AMOUNT MEANS MORE PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO POST BAIL. USINGTHEIR SERVICES THE INDUSTRY WILL SPEND LESS TIME COLLECTING OUTSTANDING DEBT AND THEREFORE THEY MAY EVEN EARN A HIGHER PROFIT IN THE END. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE INDUSTRY WANTS TO SEE. AB THIRTY EIGHT THREATENS TO MORE DEEPLY ENTRENCHED THE BAIL BONDS INDUSTRY IN THE STATE WHEN INSTEAD WE MUST CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT PRIVATE INDUSTRY PLAYS NO PART IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WHATSOEVER. FOR ALL THESE REASONS I URGE A NO VOTE ON. AB THIRTY EIGHT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALREADY HAVE ANY WITNESSES AND ROOMS THAT ARE IN OPPOSITION. ANY WITNESSES ON THE TELECONFERENCE GREEN IN OPPOSITION. AND EIGHTEEN T. A TELEPHONE OPERATOR COULD YOU BRING IN ANY ONE ON THE LINE IT'S IN OPPOSITION. OF COURSE OUR FIRST ONE COMES FROM THE LINE CHIU FORTY SEVEN PLEASE GO AHEAD.

AND THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO OTHERS IN THE QUEUE AT THIS TIME THANK YOU WE'LL BRING YOU BACK TO COMMITMENT MEMBERS AND QUESTIONS MR LACKEY. YEAH FIRST OF ALL LET ME THANK OF THE AUTHOR FOR ADDRESSING THE LONG TIME PROBLEM AND BRING FORTH WHAT WHAT I SEE IS A REASONABLE REMEDY. BUT THERE ARE A COUPLE POINTS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO JUST TOUCH ON REAL QUICKLY IF THAT'S OKAY SURE I WOULD LIKE TO FIRST OF ALL. HOW DOES YOUR BILL ADDRESS THREAT ASSESSMENT. THERE'S A STILL IN THERE BECAUSE YOU HAVE A BILL HEARING AND- OBVIOUSLY SOMEONE'S DOING THREATS YOU CAN ENHANCE THE BILL THAT THE BILL IS STILL THERE FOR THE OFFICERS. THANK GOD THE DANGER THE PUBLIC. THE JUDGE JUST OTHER BUILDING SO IT DOESN'T TAKE THAT ABILITY AWAY SO IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THERE. I APPRECIATE HEARING THAT THE OTHER ISSUE WAS BROUGHT FORWARD BY- MR ARJUN IT'S A- LEGIT. CONCERN THE RECENT US SUPREME COURT DECISION- AND I. JUST ANT TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO TRY TO MITIGATE AND- EXPLAIN HOW IT'S STILL CONSISTENT WITH THAT COURT FINDING WHAT I BELIEVE THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT DISINGENUOUS BOTTLES ATTORNEYS WHAT HUMPHREY SAID IS THAT NO PERSON. SHOULD LOSE THE RIGHT TO LIBERTY SIMPLY BECAUSE THAT PERSON CANNOT AFFORD TO POST BAIL. IT DID NOT MAKE CAST BILL IN CONSTITUTIONAL JUST REAFFIRM THAT MUST BE FAIR THAT THE INABILITY TO POST BAIL ALONE. CANNOT BE THE SOLE FACTOR SETTING BILL. SB THIRTY ACTUALLY SUPPORTS HIS DECISION IN THIS LANGUAGE AND INTENT. THEY CAN VIRTUALLY LOWER BILL US BASED ACROSS THE STATE AND LARGELY PROHIBITS BILL STACKING. AND NO ONE WE TALKED ABOUT THE BILL STACKING AND WHAT IT DOES WHEN YOU'RE BOOKED FOR TWO OR MORE FENCES. BILL SHOULD BE SETTLED FOR THE CHARGE WITH THE HIGHEST AMOUNT SUCH AS ONE CHARGE. IS NOT THAT WAY RIGHT NOW CALIFORNIA. YOU CAN ONLY HAD HIS MEN'S ONE TIME PER PERSON. AND ONE TIME FOR PRIORS IT'S NOT THAT WAY RIGHT NOW. THIS BILL WOULD NOT PROHIBIT THE COURTS FROM STACKING BILL IN WHICH THERE ARE MULTIPLE VICTIMS. THEIR SEPARATIST WAS THE CRIME OCCURS OR SEPARATE SEX ACTS AGAINST THE SAME VICTIM. SO IT REALLY ACCESS RIGHT NOW WAFFLES ONE ZERO BILL WE DON'T HAVE ZERO BILL IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW. IT'S CONFLICTING SOME FOLKS WANT TO SOME FOLKS DON'T. BUT WE DON'T HAVE IT RIGHT NOW PRESENTLY. THANK YOU FOR THOSE SECTION THEY JUST FOLLOWING UP. IN THIS THIS IS. I JUST THE REASON I MADE THIS IS. FOR THOSE THAT FOR THOSE PUBLIC DEFENDERS. ROBERT STILL ROBBERY BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE. A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE SOMEWHERE ELSE. THE ANOTHER COUNTY THAT THAT IT THAT IS ASININE THAT IS THAT WAY AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE THAT WAY WE'RE THIS POSITION BECAUSE OF JUDGES AND WE'RE THE START THAT YOU WANT TO GO BACK IN HISTORY THE START OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. BECAUSE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WAS TAKEN OFF AND THEY STARTED INCREASING BILL FOR DIFFERENT THINGS THAT'S WHEN WE SAW THE BILL SCHEDULE INCREASED DRAMATICALLY BECAUSE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IT CAUGHT UP A LOT OF OTHER THINGS AND THAT'S THE ISSUE AND THAT REGARDLESS IF WE IF WE STAY STATUS QUO RIGHT NOW. AND YOU DON'T GET A ZERO BELL. YOU'RE STILL GONNA HAVE THE BILL MUCH HIGHER ON THESE CHARGES THAT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE SO FOR SOME OF THE CALLS A CALL THEN THAT WERE DISINGENUOUS ABOUT THAT IT DOES ACTUALLY CHANGE THAT PART OF IT THAT THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGES SHOULD BE FAIR NO MATTER WHAT THE OF ROBBERS ROBBIE ABOUT RE COMMIT. THANK YOU THANK YOU COULD- ANY. SHARE TURKEY THANK YOU ARE WILL WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING A COMMONSENSE- REFORM MEASURE TO THE CURRENT BAIL SYSTEM. AND YOU KNOW WHETHER YOU ARE FOR OR AGAINST- THE BAIL SYSTEM. BUT HE WON ELIMINATED COMPLETELY OR DO YOU FEEL THAT- IT JUST NEEDS TO BE TWEAKED- FIXING THE INHERENT INEQUITIES IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM OR ARGUING THAT IT. FOR YOU CAN'T SUPPORT AN IMPROVEMENT TO THE CURRENT BAIL SYSTEM IT KIND OF MAKES NO SENSE- WHAT YOU TALKED ABOUT THERE IS AN INEQUITY WHERE IT IT. ACTUALLY IS MORE LUCRATIVE TO DO SOME- SOME OF CRIME- IN ONE COMMUNITY THAN IT IS IN ANOTHER BECAUSE OF THE BAIL SYSTEM WE HAVE. AND THIS IS A COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO FIXING THAT- OTHERS WHO WANT TO HAVE THAT OTHER GUY ARGUMENT CAN HAVE THAT- BUT- I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE THIS MAKES SENSE. AND THAT IT MAKES IT EQUAL PARTS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THANK YOU. YES MISTER MARKAY HAND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND IF YOU CAN HER EIGHT AM THANK YOU MISTER COOPER FOR ENGAGING IN THIS IMPORTANT CONVERSATION THAT IS MENTIONED BY MY COLLEAGUES IT'S HAPPENING TOO MANY BILLS THIS- THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION. AND YOU KNOW. PERSONALLY I DON'T BELIEVE IN THE MONEY WILL SYSTEM I THINK THAT DECIDING WHETHER SOMEONE STAYS IN JAIL BASED ON WHETHER THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO PAY BAIL ISN'T WHAT KEEPS OUR COMMUNITIES SAFER. I THINK IT SHOULD BE A QUESTION OF SAFETY AND RESCUE WHICH TO YOUR POINT IS A PART OF THIS BUT ONLY A PART OF IT- IT STILL COMES DOWN TO WHETHER OR NOT ONE CAN PAY. THE BILL THAT IS SET AND SO. I HEAR YOU I THINK THE INEQUITY YOU PRESENT IT IS COMPELLING AND I pTALK ABOUT JUDICIAL DISCRETION A LOT IN THIS COMMITTEE AND OTHERS AND I THINK IT MAKES SENSE FOR THE- FOR. THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO BE HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT OUR BELL SCHEDULE SHOULD BE ACROSS THE STATE- MY CONCERNS WITH THE BILL- OBVIOUSLY. TESTERS ACTORS POINT AS WELL THAT OTHER CONVERSATIONS HAPPENING ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD HAVE MANY BELL AT ALL AND IT'S- I BELIEVE THE MOVE TOWARD. CONTINUING BUT MY CONCERN IS ALSO THIS PART WHERE YOU ARE SENDING IT AS THE MAXIMUM OF THE TO WHICH YOUR POINT DOES REDUCE IT FROM STOCKING BUT IT STILL SAYS. A LIMIT RIGHT IT'S AT THE HEIGHT LIMIT POTENTIALLY FOR BALANCE SO AGAIN WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS SYSTEM WHERE WE SET IT AT THE HIGHER COST OF THE CRIMES CHARGED IN HERE SOMEBODY WHO CAN'T PAY AND NOW THEY'RE INCARCERATED NOT BECAUSE THE JUDGES DECIDED. NECESSARILY THAT THEY ARE SOMEBODY WHO NEEDS TO BE HELD WILL BE ARRESTED SOCIETY AND AS POINTED OUT BY PUBLIC DEFENDERS THAT CAN LEAD TO. THEM LOSING THEIR JOBS AND THEIR HOMES WHILE PENDING TRIAL EVEN IF THEY DON'T POSE A RISK TO THE COMMUNITY. AND SO I PERSONALLY THINK THAT WE NEED TO GET TO A POINT WHERE THE QUESTION BEFORE THE COURT. ISN'T ABOUT MONEY BUT IT IS ABOUT THE SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITY THE CRIMES COMMITTED WHETHER WE BELIEVE IF WE LET THIS PERSON ON THE STREET OUR COMMUNITY IS LESS CARE- AND SO I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS TODAY BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION ANY IMPORTANT- THE IMPORTANT PART OF THE CONVERSATION THAT YOU RAISED ABOUT THE INEQUITIES ACROSS COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU IN RESPONSE WHAT IT DOES THOUGH INSISTED THAT THE YOU. KNOW THE HIS BILL SO IT. A WON'T BE THE HIGHEST. GOING TO SET UP THE LOWER. SO IF THERE IS THEY'RE SICK OF. BILL WHAT THE- COUNCIL CAN DO. THEY CAN SAID THAT LOWER BILL SCHEDULE SO IN ESSENCE. IT WOULD BE LOWER BILL SCHEDULE SO. I GUESS PART OF THIS IS ALSO. IF ZERO BILL DOESN'T PASS. THEN THE OPTION IS WE'RE GONNA. REMAIN STATUS QUO. AND IN WITH THE BIG ISSUE IS. THE WHO'S POLICING THE JUDGES. THE REASON WE'RE IN THIS SITUATION. IS NOT. BECAUSE THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S NOT BECAUSE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS. NOT BECAUSE A LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE THIS LEGISLATURE. IS BECAUSE THE JUDGES. AND JUDGES ARE MAKING THAT DETERMINATION EVERY YEAR THEY MAKE THAT VISIT THAT. THE NORTH MAIN ISSUE. THE DIFFICULTIES AWARE OF THIS IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED. AD NAUSEAM. BUT THE NUMBERS ARE STILL HERE SO. IF YOU GUYS ARE OKAY WITH LIKE I SAID ZERO STILL A LONG WAYS AWAY FROM FROM HAPPENING. SO THIS IS GONNA BE THE DEFAULT RIGHT HERE AND REMAIN THE DEFAULT. THANK YOU ENTER ANY OTHER. COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YOU MAY CLOSE MISTER COOPER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME COMMITTEE I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. AND THANK YOU I'M I'M I'M GETTING READY TO HELP YOU RIGHT NOW MISTER COOPER- BECAUSE YOU'RE THE FIRST ONE EVER BROUGHT UP. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER YOU BROUGHT UP THE INEQUITIES IN THE BILL SCHEDULES TO MEET STATEWIDE. AND I DIDN'T REALLY EVEN KNOW ABOUT BAIL HOW IT WAS DONE LUCKILY- AND WHEN YOU TOLD ME THIS AND NOW THAT I'VE SEEN IT HERE- IT KIND OF FORCED ME TO THE POINT WHERE I WAS AT ZERO BAIL. WE SHOULD GET THAT'S WHEN I WAS FOR A LONG TO GET RID OF MONEY BAIL BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU'VE TOLD AND NOW TO ACTUALLY SEE IT WHERE I'M LOOKING AT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ACROSS THE BOARD IS OFF FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. BUT SPOUSAL BATTERY WHAT THE HECK IS LIKE FIVE GRAND IN SAMPOERNA DINO. I MEAN YOU AND I MUST GOT TO AGREE TO SOMETHING WRONG WITH THAT YES AND THEN YOUR DOING IT AND IN RESULT IT I AGREE WITH WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO. I JUST HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE METHODOLOGY. LIKE YOU TALK ABOUT THE JUDGES BUT YOU WANT TO SET UP A- A GROUP OF WHAT IS IT. FOR A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE OF REPRESENTATIVE APPOINTED BY THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND IN THE STATE SHERIFFS THE KIND OF OVERSEE LOOKING AT BELL SCHEDULE UNDER YOU JUST WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL I WOULD I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU TO JUDICIARY DISCUSSES PROBABLY WORST AND THE JUDGES AS FAR AS MAKING THESE DETERMINATIONS AND SO IS THAT METHODOLOGY THAT DEBT THAT I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE IN CROWD. I WOULD LOVE TO CAN. I THINK WE ALL NEED TO HAVE A SIT DOWN ON ALL OF THESE BILL IDEAS. BECAUSE I YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. WE HAVE TO FIX THE BAIL SCHEDULE AND HAVE A FORMAL BAIL SET YOUR SCHEDULE BEST SAYING THROUGHOUT EACH. COUNTY CITY. BOROUGH STREET LEVEL WHATEVER BECAUSE- THIS IS. THIS IS JUST INSANE INSANE- YOU KNOW FIFTY THOUSAND ALAMEDA AND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SAMPOERNA DINO. FOR ARMED ROBBERY WHY IS IT SO SIGNIFICANT- AND SO I'M I'M THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS I'M SORRY I CAN'T SUPPORTERS TODAY BUT I DO BELIEVE YOU HAVE A BALLOT. JOINT ABOUT THIS BILL SCHEDULE AND WE DO NEED TO HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSION BUT UNFORTUNATELY CAN'T SUPPORTED TODAY SIR IN JUST ONE POINT FOR VERIFICATION THAT WOULD NOT.

R. TELL YES THEY ARE TELL I WICKS. WEEKS NOW LEE LINO. I'M SORRY MEASURE FAILS THANK YOU. I THANK YOU MISTER RANDALL FOR WAITING. THANK YOU. SB SIX HUNDRED ARAMBULA HATE CRIMES IMMIGRATION STATUS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS BEFORE I BEGIN MY PRESENTATION LET ME ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS TO MAKE THIS BILL DECLARATIVE OF EXISTING LAW AS PROPOSED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. MEMBERS AB SIX HUNDRED PROTECTS OUR CONSTITUTIONAL CIVIL RIGHTS BY REITERATING CALIFORNIA'S POSITION TO PROHIBIT CRIMES AGAINST A PERSON COMMITTED BECAUSE OF THE PERSON'S ACTUAL OR ERCEIVED IMMIGRATION STATUS. DESTRUCT THIS BERMAN NATION AGAINST IMMIGRANTS IS NOT A NEW PHENOMENON IN CALIFORNIA THE STATE'S HISTORY REVEALS AN UGLY CYCLE THAT OFTEN REPEATS ITSELF IN PERIODS OF NATIONAL ANXIETY PROVOKED BY ECONOMIC RECESSION BY UNEMPLOYMENT OR PERCEIVED EXTERNAL THREATS. THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO AND THE INTERNMENT OF JAPANESE AMERICANS DURING WORLD WAR TWO ARE TWO SUCH EXAMPLES. IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES REPATRIATION DRIVE SUPPORTED BY THE HOOVER ADMINISTRATION SUBJECTED CITIZENS AND NON CITIZENS OF MEXICAN ANCESTRY TO INDISCRIMINATE MASS DEPORTATIONS. THIS SENTIMENT OF INTOLERANCE IS ON THE RISE ONCE MORE. WITH DAMAGING IMPACTS TO OUR COMMUNITIES A PANDEMIC THAT HAS TAKEN THE LIVES OF MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND AMERICANS HAS SPARKED A BACKLASH AGAINST ASIANS WHO HAVE BEEN BLAMED FOR THE SPREAD OF CORONAVIRUS RESULTING IN A MARKET UPTICK IN HATE CRIMES. IN ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITIES IN THE UNITED STATES. HATE CRIMES HAVE ALSO INCREASED IN CALIFORNIA BY 11% SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN. LATINOS HAVE BEEN IMPACTED THE MOST WITH AN INCREASE OF MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT. THIS TREND IS CONSISTENT WITH REPORTS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WITH REPORTED AN INCREASE OF HATE CRIMES OF 36% BETWEEN TWENTY THIRTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN. APPROXIMATELY FORTY FOUR MILLION IMMIGRANTS LIVE AND WORK IN THE UNITED STATES MAKING UP THIRTEEN POINT DESPITE CLEAR PROTECTIONS FOR THESE IMMIGRANTS POP RELATIONS FROM CRIME IN FEDERAL LAW AND INTERNATIONAL LAW THESE PROTECTIONS ARE NOT ALWAYS INTERPRETED PROPERLY. INSURING THESE IMMIGRANT POPULATIONS DO NOT FACED HATE BASED DISCRIMINATION WITHOUT REPRISAL IS A KEY STEP TO SUPPORTING THOSE ALREADY SHOULDERING DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS FROM THIS PANDEMIC. THE RALPH CIVIL RIGHTS ACT CIVIL CODE SECTION FIFTY ONE POINT SEVEN CURRENTLY INCLUDES IMMIGRANT STATUS AS A PROTECTED CLASS IN ADDITION MANY JURISDICTIONS IN THE STATE INTERPRET CURRENT HATE CRIME LAW TO COVER IMMIGRANT STATUS AS A PROTECTED CLASS. HOWEVER SOME JURISDICTIONS CONCLUDE THAT THE STATE'S EXISTING HATE CRIME STATUTE DOES NOT COVER IMMIGRATION AND CITIZENSHIP STATUS AS EVIDENCED BY THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN LEGISLATIVE AUDIT REPORT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATE'S HATE CRIME STATUTE. IT IS CRITICAL TO ENSURE THAT ALL JURISDICTIONS UNDERSTAND THE STATE'S POSITION WITH CRYSTAL CLARITY THAT DISCRIMINATION VIOLENCE OR THE THREAT OF VIOLENCE TOWARDS ANOTHER BASED ON IMMIGRATION STATUS IS A HATE CRIME. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS JOSEPH V. A. R. WITH CHIRLA AND NO WELL WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION. OF HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS. MR THE AREA CONTROLLER AND- MISS NO. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY TO BEGIN. ALL RIGHT- GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRPERSON JONES SAWYER VICE CHAIR LACKEY AND MEMBERS AND STAFF OF THE COMMITTEE I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBER ARRIVAL- AND ALL OF YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY IN FAVOR OF AB SIX HUNDRED. MY NAME IS ANNA WELL AND I'M NOT ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HUMAN RELATIONS ORGANIZATION CAIRO A COALITION OF THE STATE'S HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSION AND SIMILAR SOCIAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATION. ONE OF THE TASKS THAT ARE LARGER COUNTY HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSION TO PERFORM IS TO TRACK HATE CRIMES AND ISSUED YEARLY HATE CRIMES REPORT MOST NOTABLY THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSION ORANGE COUNTY HUMAN RELATIONS AND THE. SAN FRANCISCO HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION. THE STATISTIC THAT THEY- ECHO A LOT OF WHAT DOCTOR BANGALORE JUST SAID. FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS HATE CRIMES INCIDENTS HAVE INCREASED IN CALIFORNIA. FOR EXAMPLE HATE CRIMES REPORTED IN L. A. COUNTY INCREASED TWO POINT 6% IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN BALL RACIAL HATE CRIMES ROSE CRIMES IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. L. A. COUNTY TWENTY NINETEEN HATE CRIMES REPORT DOCUMENTS THAT HATE CRIMES AGAINST LATINOS. CONSTITUTED 25% OF ALL RACIAL HATE CRIME. AND THAT LATINOS WERE THE MOST LIKELY OF ANY RACIAL ETHNIC GROUPS TO BE VICTIMS OF VIOLENT RACIALLY MOTIVATED CRIME EIGHTY EIGHT PERCENT. AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN SUSPECTS USED SPECIFICALLY ANTI IMMIGRANT WORKERS IN FORTY EIGHT LAT CRIMES CASES. AND ANTI ASIAN CRIME GROUPS 32% AND ANTI MUSLIM EASTERN CRIMES ROSE A HUNDRED AND 42% SIMILARLY A RECENT CSU SAMBAR DINO CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HATE AND EXTREMISM STUDY SHOWED AN INCREASE IN ANTI ASIAN HATE CRIMES REPORTED TO POLICE. IN EIGHTEEN LARGE AMERICAN CITY INCLUDING OURS IN CALIFORNIA. FROM TWENTY NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY. EXPERTS HATE CRIMES ARE WIDELY UNDER REPORTED AND EVEN WHEN THEY ARE POLICE OFFICERS SOMETIMES FEEL TO DOCUMENT INCIDENTS INVOLVING BIAS IS THE HATE CRIME. AB SIXTEEN HUNDRED IS NEEDED AS A CLARIFIED THAT THE CURRENT HATE CRIME STATUTE IS INCLUSIVE OF IMMIGRATION STATUS. THE BILL WILL EXPLICITLY CONFORM THE CRIMINAL LAW AND PENAL CODE SECTION FOR TWENTY TWO POINT FIVE SIX. WITH A COMPARABLE CIVIL LAW UNDER THE REST OF A RIGHTS ACT THAT CIVIL CODE SECTION FIFTY ONE pTHAT THEM. STATUS IF COVERED. WE BELIEVE A. B. B. SIX HUNDRED IT'S IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE PROTECTION FOR IMMIGRANTS WHO ARE HATE CRIMES VICTIMS AND HESITANT TO REPORT CRIMES AND FOR PEACE OFFICERS THAT MAY BE UNSURE IF AN ATTACK OF AN INDIVIDUAL BASED ON AN ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED NOTION OF CITIZENSHIP COUNTY OF THE HATE CRIME. WE RESPECTFULLY URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON EIGHTY SIX HUNDRED. THANK YOU. BANK ACTION ALL AND CARE. A MENTAL OKAY COMMITTEE I WAS JUST OF GEL ADDRESS OUR POLICY ADVOCATE TO CHECK OUT THE COALITION HUMANE IMMIGRANT RIGHTS. WE APOLOGIZE MAYBE MAYBE HUNDRED AND WE- ALIGN OUR I SENT WITH THE PREVIOUS- THAT'S BECAUSE MOST OF WITH THE IF STATEMENT SO- A DOCTOR HAVE A LOT. ADDING TO THAT IS GOOD TO KNOW THAT AIM TO THINK TWENTY TWENTY THAT SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER INDICATED AND TRACK SEVENTY TWO ORGANIZED HATE GROUPS IN CALIFORNIA. THIS INCREASE FROM PREVIOUS YEARS APPLE WAIT THEY LACK OF TRANSAMERICA ALL REPORTING CRIMES IN ADDITION TO ATTEMPT A LACK OF CLARITY.

C. R. TURNOUT VOTING WICKS. WICKS I'D LI. LI I. M. THANK YOU THE MEASURE PASSES THANK YOU MISTER. TO AND. I DON'T KNOW THREE MISTER CARILLO AB. NINE SEVEN. THAT WOULD BE IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT I'D ITEM NUMBER THREE. THANK YOU MAY BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY MISS KOREA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PROUD TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL NINE THREE SEVEN THE VISION ACT WHICH WOULD PROTECT REFUGEE AND IMMIGRANT CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE BEEN TO DEEMED ELIGIBLE FOR RELEASE FOR BEAN FROM BEING FUNNELED INTO IMMIGRATION DETENTION BY CALIFORNIA. LOCAL JAILS AND PRISONS THESE ARE CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE COMPLETED THEIR TIME EARNED PAROLE OR HAVE THEIR SENTENCES COMMUTED BY THE GOVERNOR AFTER A CLOSE REVIEW OTHER CLEMENCY APPLICATION WHEN LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IN CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION ASSIST WITH TRANSFERS OF THESE INDIVIDUALS TO ICE. THE IGNORE THEIR RECORD OF REHABILITATION STABLE REENTRY PLAN AND THEIR NETWORK OF COMMUNITY AND FAMILY SUPPORT. MANY CALIFORNIA COUNTIES INCLUDING LOS ANGELES SANTA CLARA SAN FRANCISCO AND CONTRA COSTA HAVE RECOGNIZED THIS AND HAVE HALTED OR CUT BACK ON TRANSFERS TO IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS ONCE SOMEONE HAS SERVED THEIR TIME. MEMBERS IF NOT IF NOT FOR WHERE THESE INDIVIDUALS WERE BORN THEY WOULD BE ALLOWED TO RETURN HOME TO THEIR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES AB NINE THREE SEVEN WILL MOVE OUR STATE CLOSER TO FULFILLING ITS COMMITMENT TO IMMIGRANT RIGHTS AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. WE RECOGNIZE THAT OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM IS DISPROPORTIONATELY AND HAS DISPROPORTIONATELY HARM BLACK LATINO INDIGENOUS AND AAPI COMMUNITIES IN RECENT YEARS THE LEGISLATURE IN CALIFORNIA VOTERS HAVE DEMONSTRATED A COMMITMENT AND A WILLINGNESS TO REFORM OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND END MASS INCARCERATION. HOWEVER FOR IMMIGRANTS WHO HAVE EARNED THEIR RELEASE THIS JUST MEANS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE HANDED OVER TO ICE AND FACE PERMANENT SEPARATION FROM THEIR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES ONE MAY SAY THAT THIS BILL WOULD INTERFERE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S EXCLUSIVE ABILITY TO REGULATE IMMIGRATION HOWEVER. THE TENTH AMENDMENT OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION UNEQUIVOCALLY GIVES CALIFORNIA THE AUTHORITY TO NOT ALLOW OUR STATE RESOURCES TO BE USED IN ASSISTING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WITH ENFORCING. IMMIGRATION LAW JUST LAST WEEK A WOMAN FROM ALL MONEY NAME GABBY SOLANO WAS TRANSFERRED BY THE DIFFERENT FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION TO ICE. GABBY CAME TO THIS COUNTRY WHEN SHE WAS JUST TWO YEARS OLD AS A LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENT SHE IS A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVOR AND SPENT HALF HER LIFE BEHIND BARS. FOR A CRIME COMMITTED BY HER EX ABUSIVE PARTNER. AFTER SERVING TWENTY YEARS IN STATE PRISON GOVERNOR BROWN COMMUTED HER SENTENCE IN RECOGNITION OF HER DEMONSTRATED RECORD OF COMMITMENT TO SERVICE. MENTORSHIP AND REHABILITATION HOWEVER. RATHER THAN ALLOW GABBY TO RETURN HOME TO HER FAMILY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA A PRIVATE COMPANY CONTRACTED WITH ICED PICKED HER UP FROM THE CDC OUR FACILITY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND TRANSPORTED HER TO A DETENTION CENTER IN COLORADO WHERE SHE REMAINS TODAY. IMMIGRANT CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE SERVED OUT THEIR SENTENCES OR HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN DEEMED ELIGIBLE FOR RELEASE SHOULD NOT FACE A SECOND PUNISHMENT. WE SHOULD NOT FUNNEL TEM INTO A FEDERAL IMMIGRATION DETENTION AND DEPORTATION SYSTEM. THE VISION ACT WILL AND ICE TRANSFERS FROM OUR LOCAL JAILS AND CDCR A PRACTICE THAT TREATS PEOPLE DIFFERENTLY. BASED ON WHERE THEY WERE BORN. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS BILL AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS AS THIS MOVE FORWARD.

IN OPPOSITION I THINK I HAVE- COREY SELVES ELLO CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION AND JONATHON FELDMAN CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ON THE PHONE IN OPPOSITION. NEARLINE THEY'RE OPEN. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CORY CELLS- ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION REGRETTABLY HERE IN OPPOSITION TO AB NINE THREE SEVEN- WE WERE CONCERNED THAT THIS BILL WOULD FURTHER IMPEDE LAW ENFORCEMENT COORDINATION- WITH OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT- THIS AGENCIES WHEN IT COMES TO MATTERS OF PUBLIC SAFETY AS WE STATED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE DEBATE ABOUT SB FIFTY FOUR SHARES DO NOT UNDERTAKE IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT. THAT SAID MANY COUNTIES MAKE PUBLIC INFORMATION ABOUT PERSONS DETAINED IN JAILS FOR SEVERAL REASONS ALSO STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES MAY BE ASKED TO PROVIDE SAFETY SUPPORT FOR ARRESTS UNDERTAKEN BY OTHER AGENCIES MAYBE NINE THIRTY SEVEN WOULD ELIMINATE THE ABILITY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TO DO EITHER OF THOSE THINGS IF THE ACTION HAPPEN TO INCLUDE AN IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT PURPOSE. FURTHER ELIMINATING THE REQUIREMENT THAT OFFENDERS PLACE OF BIRTH BE INCLUDED IN BASIC INFORMATION STORED IN STATE OR LOCAL CRIMINAL OFFENDER RECORD INFORMATION SYSTEMS. WILL MAKE THAT INFORMATION LESS ACCURATE AND LESS USEFUL TO THE STAKEHOLDERS WHO RELY UPON THAT INFORMATION. THE RESPECTIVE OF WHETHER THE PERSON IS SUBJECT TO ANY IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT ACTION. FOR THESE REASONS PLUS THE FACT THAT THIS BILL UNDER AS MANY OF THESE NEGOTIATED PROVISIONS. OF THE FINAL VERSION OF SB FIFTY FOUR. WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL THANK YOU. OUR NEXT. YEAH GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS JONATHON FELDMAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION ALSO IN OPPOSITION AS MY COLLEAGUE STATED THE VISION ACT EXPLICITLY UNDERMINES THE COMPROMISE REACHED IN SB FIFTY FOUR THE SANCTUARY STATE LAW I THAT WAS TRAPPED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN- AB NINETY SEVEN DALY TAKES US BACK TO DAY ONE. AND THAT DEBATE AND FOR THOSE EITHER REMEMBER THAT DEBATE IT WAS A VERY THOROUGH COMPREHENSIVE DISCUSSION ABOUT SETTING RULES. AND RESTRICTIONS ON LAW ENFORCEMENT ENGAGEMENT IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT PURPOSES- THAT DEBATE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN ENDED WITH THE POLICE SHE'S BEEN THE ONLY LAW ENFORCEMENT GROUPS THAT GO NEUTRAL. NEGOTIATE A COMPROMISE THAT SET PRETTY CLEAR LIMITS ON. RESPONDING TO ICE REQUESTS FOR HOLDS- SHARING INFORMATION ON LOW LEVEL OFFENSES ARE YOU CANNOT DO IT FOR ANY- LOW LEVEL MISDEMEANOR ANY PROP FORTY SEVEN CRIMES- WE AGREED TO A FIFTEEN YEAR WASHOUT PERIOD FOR JAIL FELONIES BUT YOU STILL ARE ABLE TO SHARE INFORMATION ON SERIOUS AND VIOLENT FELONIES- WE ALSO AGREED TO PRETTY- THE SIGNIFICANT PROVISIONS THAT ALLOWED. LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO PARTICIPATE IN TASK FORCES WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS AS LONG AS THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THE JOINT. TASK FORCE IS NOT IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT- THROUGHOUT THIS WE HAVE LOCAL AND STATE AGENCIES PARTNERING WITH FEDERAL AGENCIES ON. ANTI TERRORISM TASK FORCE- I WAS GOING AFTER MAJOR INTERNATIONAL CARTELS AND HUMAN TRAFFICKERS THEY DO USE IMMIGRATION- VIOLATIONS TO GO AFTER SOME OF THE SHOCK COLLARS IN THE MAJOR CRIME SYNDICATES- THE EXAMPLE WE ALWAYS GIVE A SIMILAR TO YOU KNOW HOW THE IRS WENT AFTER CAPONE. THEY USE THOSE TYPES OF VIOLATIONS TO GO AFTER SOME OF THE REALLY BAD ACTORS- THOSE AMENDMENTS WERE ALL AGREED TO AND YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID IT'S- ABOUT NINE MONTH PERIOD NEGOTIATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS- AND UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL EXPLICITLY UNDERMINES ALL OF THAT- MINUTES FIRST PARAGRAPH- WE WOULD LIKE. TO CONTINUE CONGRESS WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER REGARDING THE BILL- WE'VE REACHED OUT TO OUR OFFICE WE HAD A- FINANCIAL DISCUSSION EARLIER THIS WEEK. I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT THE PROBLEM IS WHERE THE IN EFFECT INEFFICIENCIES ARE WITHIN SB FIFTY FOUR- AND IF THERE ARE AREAS THAT NEED TO BE IMPROVED- CLEANED UP- WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS BEEN TRYING. TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY. TOWARDS THE IN ABOUT SIMILAR GOALS ACTUALLY I'M REALLY BEING CLEAR WITH OUR BOUNDARIES BETWEEN LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL PARTNERS- BUT UNFORTUNATELY AS DRAFTED. AS I SAID THIS REALLY TAKE THIS BACK- THE SQUARE ONE IN THE IN THE INITIAL DEBATES ON SB FIFTY FOUR IN THE SANCTUARY STATE LAWS- AND WE HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS WITH THE LANGUAGE IN PRINT. AND ARE THEREFORE OPPOSED. THANK YOU MR FELDMAN- ARE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IN THE ROOM. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ON THE VIDEO CONFERENCING LINE. AT T. R. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ON THE PHONE. YEAH LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO OPPOSE AB NINE THREE SEVEN PRESS THE LONDON ZERO NOW AGAIN TO OPPOSE AB NINE THREE SEVEN PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO NOW. AND WE'RE SHOWING Q. AND THE Q.

AT THANK YOU SIR MAXIMOFF CAROLINE THREE FIFTY PLEASE GO AHEAD. THIS IS YOUR MEMBERS RANDY PARA THEIR REDUCE HAS AS HOW THE HOUSE WILL ACT IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND THAT TIME THERE'S NO ONE ELSE TO MAKE YOU. THANK YOU ARE BRING BACK TO COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS MR LEE HAS A QUESTION. ASSEMBLY BAKERY- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- ASSEMBLY MACRI ALLEGED I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS AND BRING FOR THE VISION ACT I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY TIMELY RIGHT NOW GIVEN. THE RISE IN RESURGENCE OF ANTI RIGHT NOW IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THIS BILL IS OF COURSE BENEFITING A LOT OF OUR COMMUNITY DOES HURT RIGHT NOW I THINK A COMMON REFRAIN THE MOST MEMBERS OF ASIAN AFRICAN COMMUNITY YOU'LL HEAR TALK ABOUT IS GO BACK TO YOUR COUNTRY RIGHT OBVIOUSLY NOT UNIQUE TO OUR COMMUNITY. BUT SOMETHING CERTAINLY YOU HEAR ALL THE TIME WELL THIS BILL IS TRYING TO ADDRESS SOMETHING WE STRUCTURALLY THAT WE ARE ALL AND FORTUNATELY- PAYING FOR IS THEY LITERALLY DEPORTING PEOPLE BACK TO THEIR COUNTRY EVEN THOUGH. A FORTUNE A LOT OF PEOPLE GET COULD DROP BACK IN VIETNAM OR LAOS HAVE GROWN UP IN CALIFORNIA GROWN UP IN THIS COUNTRY THE DROPPED IN A COUNTRY THAT IS JUST AS FOREIGN. TO US PERHAPS THE AS THEM AND I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT EVEN DURING THE BINDING RESTORATION FEBRUARY THIRTY THREE VIETNAMESE AMERICANS WERE PUT ON ONE FLIGHT BACK DEPORTED BACK TO AMERICA I DEFERRED BACK TO VIETNAM. AND THERE HAS BEEN A- TWO HUNDRED OR 210079% SPIKE IN DEPORTATIONS OF CAMBODIAN AMERICANS JUST IN TWENTY SEVEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN ALONE. SO DEPORTATIONS WHILE THIS AFFECTS EVERY COMMUNITY OF COLOR IN FORTUNE EVERY COMMENCEMENT IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY IS STRUCTURING ALSO SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN WEAPONIZED TOWARDS API COMMITTEE AND SOMETHING THAT HAS FRANKLY TORN ALL OF OUR COMMITTEES APART AND BUILDS MISTRUST IN OUR COMMUNITY. WHEN AND I THINK A LOT ABOUT MY CONSTITUENTS TO HAVE FLED. WAR TORN BATTLEFIELDS OF VIETNAM LAOS AND CAMBODIA WITH NOTHING BUT A VAGUE VISION OF A BETTER LIFE FOR THEIR KIDS I'M SURE THEY WILL BE COMPLETELY HEARTBROKEN TO THINK THAT THEIR KIDS THAT THEY BROUGHT OVER ON THE BOATS OR PLANES OR EVEN EVACUATING WAR ZONES. COULD BE PLUCKED FROM THE COMMUNITY GROWN THAT THEY RISKED THEIR LIVES TO GET THEM TO JUST BECAUSE A MISTAKE THAT DECADES AGO IN THEIR YOUTH SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK AND ESPECIALLY NOW THAT WE'RE ADDRESSING SYSTEMIC VIOLENCE IN THE FOR DEPORTATIONS AND FAMILY SEPARATION. ESPECIALLY FOR ANTI FOR OUR ASIAN AMERICAN CAN. NOW SO I REALLY HOPE THE EVERYONE WILL BE SO. THIS BILL I I'M HAPPY BE A CO AUTHOR ON IT AS WELL. THANK YOU MR CLARK. SO CERTAINLY- I SUPPORT THE WITNESSES THAT THE- AUTHOR BROUGHT FORWARD AND I WOULD CERTAINLY SUPPORT THEY'RE GETTING HOT THE ABILITY TO STAY HERE AND I ALSO SUPPORT. A MUCH OF WHAT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE HAD TO SAY MY CONCERN IS THAT NOT EVERYBODY'S LIKE THAT. SO THERE ARE VIOLENT FELONS WHO NEVER GET- ANY GOOD TIME ARE THEY SERVE THEIR TIME AND THEY COME OUT AND THEY'RE STILL LAW HELPED- THE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS WAS LOST BECAUSE IN MASSACHUSETTS THEY ALLOWED A IN MAY HAVE A WEEKEND LEAVE WILLIE HORTON. WAS IT TERRIBLY RACIST AD THAT IT WORKED REALLY HARD AND WENT OUT AND KILLED SOMEBODY REALLY WAS ON LEAVE AND THAT WAS USED AGAINST. GEORGE BUSH'S OPPONENT THE GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS DUKAKIS. TO WIN AN ELECTION AND YOU KNOW IF WE ALLOW SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO HAPPEN. WE COULD LOSE ALL OF THIS WE COULD LOSE THE VALUES ACT WHICH OF COURSE I VOTED FOR MOST OF THE PEOPLE HERE WE HERE AT THE TIME VOTED FOR. SO WHAT WE NEED IS TO BE ABLE. TO IF SOMEBODY HAS DONE A SERIOUS AND VIOLENT FELONY. EITHER WE EXCLUDE THEM FROM THIS PROGRAM OR IF WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW THE MEN THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME SORT OF PROOF. THAT THEY'VE IN FACT REFORM THAT COULD COME UP AND I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THIS TO SAY WHETHER. YOU KNOW WE COULD LOOK AT THE PAROLE BOARD OR SOMETHING ELSE BUT- I CANNOT SUPPORT EVERYONE'S GETTING THIS PRIVILEGE. I AM THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENT TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRK I DO WANT TO ADDRESS MAJOR CONCERNS REGARDING THE PAROLE BOARD IN AND COMMIT TO CONTINUING TO WORK TO GET THIS LEGISLATION CORRECT IN ADDRESSING THE ISSUES THAT YOU'RE BRINGING UP- THE BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS IN AN EFFORT TO IF AN INDIVIDUAL IS TO GO IN FRONT OF THE- ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RELEASE THEY MUST DEMONSTRATE SATISFACTION TO THE BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS THAT THEY ARE REHABILITATED. THAT THEY ARE REMOTE REMORSEFUL FOR THEIR CRIME HAVE A REENTRY PLAN ARE NOT A DANGER TO THE PUBLIC OR SAFETY- THROUGH THE ASSISTING ABILITY HEARING PROCESS AND DURING THE REVIEW PROCESS INDIVIDUALS MUST UNDERGO A THOROUGH PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT THAT INCLUDES A REVIEW OF THEIR LIFE BEGINNING FROM WHERE THEY WERE US CHILDREN ANY SUBSTANCE ABUSE HISTORY ANY MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES- PAROLE PLANS ADVANCEMENT FOR RHYS FIRELANDS AND OTHER RISK CONDITIONS AND RISK FOR FUTURE VIOLENCE ADDITIONALLY. THE PAROLE BOARD CONSIDERS THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF INSIGHT AS A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR OF DETERMINING WHETHER THERE IS A RATIONAL NEXUS BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUALS PAST BEHAVIOR AND THE THREAT TO- CURRENTLY PERCENT THAT THE INDIVIDUAL CURRENTLY POSSESSES TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY THE BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS SUSTAINABILITY HEARINGS ARE CONDUCTED BY A CONDEMNED A COMMISSIONER APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR DISTRICT ATTORNEYS FROM PROSECUTING COUNTY SUBMIT STATEMENTS ON THE QUESTIONS ARE WHETHER. AS WELL AS A REPRESENTATIVES MAY ATTEND THE HEARING AND PROVIDE A STATEMENT THERE IS A LOT MORE THAT I CAN SHARE WITH THE U. S. I'M ALSO LEARNING THE PROCESS- BUT I AM COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT WE FIND A PATH FORWARD- AND THAT ULTIMATELY WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS A JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT IS PALATABLE THAT NO MATTER WHEREYOU COME FROM IF YOU ARE NOT BORN IN THE US AND YOU COMMITTED A CRIME. YOU SHOULD SERVE YOUR TIME AND IF YOUR TIME IS SERVED AND YOU ARE NOW ELIGIBLE TO BE RELEASED. THAT SHOULD BE THE CASE THAT IS A JUST. JUSTICE SYSTEM. WHERE WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE POSSIBLY CAN TO ENSURE. THAT WE PROVIDE THE NECESSARY RESOURCES FOR REHABILITATION. THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS IT'S NOT JUST THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. IT'S A DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. AND WE ARE ENSURING THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS THE FUNDS AND RESOURCES NECESSARY. TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE COMMITTED A CRIME. ARE ABLE TO GO TO SCHOOL LEARN A TRADE. COME BACK INTO SOCIETY BE REUNITED WITH THEIR FAMILIES. AND LET'S NOT USE THIS IDEA OF FEAR. AS A WAY TO NEGATE THE FACT THAT PEOPLE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABILITY. IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THE OPPOSITION TESTIMONY BRINGS UP. L. CAPONE AND IRS AND THE IRS AS A WAY TO DETERMINE. WHETHER THERE IS A FEAR MONGERING AMONG. IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE ALREADY. SERVED THEIR TIME AND PAID THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY. SO AGAIN I WILL JUST SHARE I TO I'M LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE PAROLE BOARD. AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT COMMUNITIES ARE SAFE. THAT PEOPLE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REUNITE WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS YOU KNOW WHAT I HEARD IS YOU'RE NOT CHANGING THE BILL. BECAUSE WHAT YOU SAID AS WELL IF THEY'RE ON PAROLE THEY'RE FINE. LOOK IF SOMEONE HAS SERVED. THEIR FULL TIME. THEY CAN'T KEEP THEM IN JAIL ANY LONGER THAN THAT. WHETHER OR NOT ANY OF THOSE CONDITIONS ARE. FOR FELT. NOW FOR ALL OF THOSE CONDITIONS YOU MENTIONED- FOR FILLED. I'M FINE. BUT WE HAVE A HUGE RECIDIVISM RATE. SO CLEARLY NOT EVERYONE LET OUT FROM THE PRESENCE. IS NOT GOING TO OFFEND AGAIN. I NEED SOMETHING STRONGER THAN SIMPLY THE PERSON HAS GONE ON PAROLE I NEED TO HAVE AN M. WE SHOULDN'T TRYING TO TERMINATE HERE NOW AGAIN BUT YOU DESCRIBED AS THE PAROLE FOLKS BEING LEFT OUT AND THEY FILL ALL THESE CONDITIONS THAT'S FINE BUT NOT EVERYBODY GOES OUT DOES. AND LOTS OF PEOPLE PROBABLY I THINK IT'S THE MAJORITY DO RESET AVE AND ALL WE NEED IS ONE MURDER BY SOMEONE WILL FLAT OUT. CAN WE LOSE THE WHOLE PROGRAM CELLS SURE ME THAT YOU WILL FIND A WAY. THAT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT JUST THAT THEY WERE LET OUT OF PRISON. BUT THAT THERE IS ADEQUATE EVIDENCE. THAT THEY WILL IN FACT. THERE'S A HIGH PROBABILITY NOTHING IS PERFECT NOT REALLY A FAN THAT'S WHAT I NEED OKAY I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL WORK TOWARDS THAT AND IN IF I MAY CAN WE CALL ON MISS ANGELA CHAN TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS AS WELL. WHAT I'M SATISFIED WITH WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY I DON'T KNOW ANYONE ELSE OKAY I JUST A LOT LESS GRAVERT MISS WICKS I'M FINE THURMOND THANK. IN A MISTER SANTIAGO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL THANK- ASSEMBLY MEMBER COREY ADVOCATING GOING TO. YOU NEXT TIME ADVOCATING THAT. I'M SORRY MISS BAUER K. YES THEY CHERISH. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CLEAR THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL UP AND FOR YOUR CONTINUED ADVOCACY ON SOCIAL JUSTICE ISSUES I WOULD JUST LOVE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR AND I'M- HAPPY TO VOTE FOR THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU. MAYES FOR BACKUP R. K. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- THANK YOU MISS CRABB YOUR PRESENTATION TODAY- I DO HAVE CONCERNS WITH SOME OF THE SERIOUS AND VIOLENT FELONS BETTER DRESSED IN THIS BUT I ACTUALLY WANT TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS- WIFE MR FELDMAN TOUCH ON TODAY BUT WHAT I THINK WAS LAID OUT. AND IN HIS LETTER- VERY WELL WHICH IS THIS WHAT I BELIEVE FOR YOUR PRESENTATION TODAY IS AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE- BUT THAT THE LANGUAGE AS WRITTEN COULD STAND IN THE WAY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERSHIP ON FOR EXAMPLE- ANTI TERRORISM TASK FORCE THAT HAPPENED BOTH AT THE FEDERAL AND THE LOCAL LEVEL AND YOU KNOW THEY SAY THE LANGUAGE IN SB FIFTY FOUR THAT ENSURE THAT THAT WORK WAS NOT FOR IMMIGRATION PURPOSES BUT WAS FOR ANOTHER PURPOSE AND THAT. I'M I'M CONCERNED THAT THAT WORK THAT I BELIEVE IS CRITICAL TO OUR SAFETY WOULD BE- POTENTIALLY AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF THAT LANGUAGE IT'S PRESENTED TODAY TO MY DRESSING. SEVEN THE SO YOU WANT TO DRESS TO ISSUE OF THE TASK FORCE YES AND THE LETTER THE LETTER LOCAL PARTNERSHIPS THAT ARE HAPPY AND WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT NOT FOR IMMIGRATION PURPOSES BUT FOR PUBLIC SAFETY SO REGARDING THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION LETTER THEY SIDE THE CHANGING LIMITATIONS ON JOINT TASK FORCES OF THE BASIS FOR THEIR OPPOSITION. RIGHT SB FIFTY FOUR PROHIBITS JOINT TASK FORCE OPERATION WENT IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT IS THE PRIMARY PURPOSE RIGHT. DIVISION ACT WILL PROHIBIT JOINT TASK FORCE OPERATION ON IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT IS A PURPOSE OR THE ONLY PURPOSE. DIVISION ACT INCLUSIVE TO FORM BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE. TO ENFORCE THE PROVISIONS OF SB FIFTY FOUR S. SOME LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WOULD SIMPLY JUST CLAIM THE PURPOSE. TO BE H. ASK- TASK FORCE WAS CRIMINAL ENFORCEMENT EVEN THOUGH THE IMMIGRATION ARRESTS WERE ALSO CONDUCTED. HAS ALSO JUST CONCERNING THAT IN THEIR LETTER THEY ADMIT THAT THEY USE IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT TO DETAIN. PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY BASICALLY CAN'T MEET THE BURDEN OF PROOF TO ARREST OR PROSECUTE PEOPLE FOR CRIMINAL ENFORCEMENT PURPOSES. THIS IS THE LINE THAT ICE HAS BEEN PUSHING FOR AT LEAST A DECADE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. AN ICE OFFICIAL TOLD ATTENDEES AT THE POLICE FOUNDATION NATIONAL CONFERENCE THAT IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO CHARGE A PERSON CRIMINALLY. AND THAT THEY THINK THE PERSON IS UNDOCUMENTED- TO JUST HAND THEM TO ICE TO MAKE THEM DISAPPEAR. SO WHAT I. WHAT I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ON. IS THAT REGARDLESS OF WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL IS BORN. THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS SHOULD NOT CONTINUE A PERPETUAL PUNISHMENT. THEY HAVE SERVED THEIR TIME. SOME ARE ACTUALLY IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS THE- EXAMPLE THAT I GAVE EARLY IN MY TESTIMONY WAS ABOUT A PERMANENT RESIDENT. WHO IS POTENTIALLY ARE BEING DEPORTED AND IS CURRENTLY IN AN ICE DETENTION FACILITY. I WOULD HATE THAT THIS BODY CONTINUES TO FEAR MONGERING OF IMMIGRANTS JUST SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY ARE SEEN AS THE OTHER. THE TESTIMONY SAY YOU HEARD TODAY ARE EXAMPLES OF WHO ARE GOING TO BE HELPED WITH THE VISION ACT AND I'M SORRY TO SAY THAT. EVEN THOUGH SB FIFTY FOUR IS IN EFFECT RIGHT NOW AND TECHNICALLY AND LAW IT PROHIBITS- ASKING IMMIGRATION- QUESTIONS REGARDING A TASK FORCE IT'S STILL BEING USED. AND WE NEED TO CLARIFY THAT AND ENSURE THAT THAT'S NOT THE CASE IN CALIFORNIA SO I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING INITIAL CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH BOTH THE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION OF POLICE CHIEFS AND PARK AS WE MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD. I'M NOT SOMEONE THAT IS CLOSED OFF TO HAVING CONVERSATIONS I WANT TO HAVE THE RESOLUTION NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT WE MOVE FORWARD- AND LOOK FORWARD TO ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU. AND YET ANOTHER PUSH. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMMENT AND I DO LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU PERSONALLY BUT ALSO WITH- YOU KNOW THE POLICE TO BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT- I APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWER I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN HAVE MISTER FELDMAN GIVE HIS PERSPECTIVE ON IT BUT I THINK- TIER POINTS RIGHT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TASK FORCE SET UP FOR NOT IMMIGRATION PURPOSES WHICH WHAT IS. IS WHAT A LOT OF SB FIFTY FOUR AND THOSE THAT ARE IN- AND YOU'RE CORRECT YOUR LANGUAGE FOCUSES ON THAT ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT SO- AGAIN I HOPE YOU GUYS CAN COME TOGETHER SO THAT THERE IS NOT AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF AFFECTING THOSE. NOT INTEGRATION. INVESTIGATION THANK YOU MR SANTIAGO- THANK TAKE ONE LAST CALL FOR PURPOSES SPEAKING. DOUBLE MAST YEAH SO APOLOGETIC MR THANK YOU FOR- FOR THE ROBUST DEBATE AND I'M ON IT TOTAL MAYBE CARVE A COUPLE THINGS YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THE- THE EXAMPLE OF THE- WILLIE HORTON TECH AND THAT PERSON WAS NOT UNDOCUMENTED- SO IT'S VERY CLEAR OF WHO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CLEAR THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE- IN THE NATIONAL RHETORIC RHETORIC. OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS THERE WAS LOTS OF THE TAX- ON UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS IN FACT WE HAD A PRESIDENT WHO STARTED OFF A CAMPAIGN BY CALLING. MEXICANS MY CUT MY FAMILY'S COUNTRY OF ORIGIN- RAPISTS CRIMINALS AND THE SUCH I THINK THAT TEAMS THE WAY WE TAKE A LOOK AT- SOMETIMES A DIFFERENT CULTURE SO- AND I THINK LIKE. WE HADN'T YET AND WE HAD ICE WHO BECAME- A DEPORTATION MACHINE. AND I'M I'M GONNA SAY THIS BECAUSE I HAVE TO GET OFF MY CHEST THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS YOU CAN'T FEEL SYMPATHETIC- FOR THE IMMIGRANT WHO'S SITTING IN A CAGE IN CHILDREN HER SIT IN CAGES AND THEN NOT FEEL- SYMPATHETIC- FOR THE ACTIONS THAT CAUSED THAT. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT LOOK IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE. ANY SPECIAL TREATMENT FOR ANYBODY WHO IS INCARCERATED. IT UP AND I WILL SAY ON A SIDE NOTE THAT I THAT I THAT I UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE OF REHABILITATION AND MAKING SURE THAT THAT PERSON DOESN'T COMMIT THE SAME CRIMES BUT THE THING THAT'S THE SAME ISSUE WE FACE WITH ANY RESTORATIVE JUSTICE POLICIES THAT WE DEBATE. WHICH IS THAT THE PERSON. REHABILITATES THEMSELVES FINDS A BETTER. A BETTER THEMSELVES. AND BECOMES A PRODUCTIVE- A PERSON A SOCIETY WE HOPE THAT FOR EVERYONE THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE THAT'S THE WORK OF PUBLIC SAFETY HAS DONE. THAT SO WE PUSH VERY STRONGLY FOR. AND WE CROSS OUR FINGERS AND WE HOPE IT WORKS BECAUSE WE KNOW WHEN OUR SOULS THAT IT'S A BETTER WAY OF. OF DOING A CRIMINAL JUSTICE- A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ARGUMENT JUSTICE SYSTEM'S JUST BROKE BUT JUST FACE SOME OF OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IS BROKEN. BUT WHAT IS THE COR ROUTE IS THIS. IS IF WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT EQUALITY EQUITY- FOR EVERYONE. AND IF WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT FIXING A BROKEN- CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THEN WE HAVE TO ALSO TALK ABOUT. MAKING IT FAIR FOR EVERYONE. AND BUT I MEAN BY THAT IS IF YOU WERE DOCUMENTED OR UNDOCUMENTED- YOU YOU HAVE TO HAVE A THE SCENE PLAYING FIELD FOR FOLKS. I KNOW IT'S HARD BECAUSE I'VE TALKED TO PEOPLE WHO STRUGGLED WITH THIS CONCEPT AND CERTAINLY WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT SB FIFTY FOUR THE WITH A LOT OF HEATED DEBATE ABOUT. A LOT OF HEATED DEBATE ABOUT THIS. THE PERSON TO STILL SERVE THEIR TIME. NOTHING IN THIS BILL SUGGEST ANY DIFFERENT. BUT THAT PERSON ALSO HAS IT COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE A FAMILY. ONCE SAID THAT AND I SAID A VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE I I'M GONNA SHARE SOME A LITTLE BIT. ONCE A PERSON TO SERVE THEIR TIME. WHETHER YOU'VE THROWN THE WHOLE BOOK I DON'T FOR HALF THE BOOK ADAM. THEY SERVE THEIR TIME SO SHOULDN'T THAT PERSON. MALE OR FEMALE BE TREATED EQUALLY TO ANYONE ELSE. WHO HAS SERVED THEIR TIME. WHICH MEANS GO BACK TO COMMUNITY. AND TRY TO BE A BETTER SELF. THAT'S REALLY WHAT ABOUT. BUT A LOT OF EARLY ONSET YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS YOU HAVE TO SEE THE OTHER SIDE- A WHAT THIS DOES IMMIGRATION DEBATE IN THIS COUNTRY. NOW MOST OF US HAVE NEVER HAD- I HAVE NEVER HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF LIVING WITH UNDOCUMENTED PARENTS BUT I CAN TELL YOU I HAD. AND D. A. V. IT AND I KNOW MY COLLEAGUE HAS AS WELL. THE FEAR AND YOU CANNOT IMAGINE. THE NO THEIR PARENTS PROBABLY WON'T COME HOME EVERY TIME TO LEAVE THE HOUSE IS REAL. AND WHAT WE SAW HAPPEN FOUR YEARS AGO WITH FAMILIES PICKED UP ON THE STREETS AND- THE FOLKS THROWN OUT WE'VE HAD IN OUR COMMUNITIES OR CONSTANTLY UP AT WORK- PARENT LEAVE THE KID AND I SAW SONORA THAT THAT'S NOT A HIGH SCHOOL WE SAW IN OUR COMMUNITIES. FOLKS HIDING AND NOT SENDING THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO LEAVE. BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS IF YOU'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT FAIRNESS AND EQUALITY GOTTA TALK ABOUT FEAR- IF YOU'RE IN A QUALITY LAWS. WHAT HAPPENS WHAT WHAT WITHOUT WITH THOSE PEOPLE ONCE YOU'VE GONE THROUGH THIS FRAMEWORK. THAT IS GOING TO BE IRONCLAD BUT NOTHING IS. A FRAMEWORK OF A PAROLE BOARD THAT PERSON HAS THAT OPPORTUNITY TO RESTART AND BILL THAT'S THAT SORT COMMUNITY THAT'S OUR FAMILY. BUT IF YOU TAKE UP PERSONAL WAY. AFTER THEY'VE SERVED THEIR SENTENCE. AND APART TO KNOW WHAT YOU'VE DONE BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE DONE. A SENTENCING AND HIRE OTHER FAMILY WITHOUT A DAD WITHOUT A MOM BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY. THAT'S THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS EITHER THERE WITH WITH THE START OF JUSTICE OR YOU'RE NOT EITHER BELIEVE THE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE. OR YOU DON'T. YOU TO JUST BELIEVE AND SOME PEOPLE HAVE A RESTORATIVE JUSTICE. AND NOT EVERYBODY ELSE. AND I DON'T SEE THE NOTES COMES UP A LITTLE BIT STRONGER. BUT THAT'S THE ARGUMENT WE FACE ABOUT WHAT WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. ALL WE COULD DO IT FOR EVERYBODY ELSE CAN'T DO A FOR SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN DOCUMENTED BECAUSE A LITTLE DIFFERENT. THEY CAME IN A LITTLE DIFFERENT. THEY SMELL DIFFERENT THEY WORK A LITTLE DIFFERENT. WITH ALL KINDS OF NAMES ALL KINDS OF FLOWERS. AT THE END OF THE DAY. A HUMAN IS A HUMAN IS A HUMAN I HAVE A FRIEND A FRIEND OF MINE HE'S TO JOKE AROUND. AND YOU SAY NO THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT PERSON OVER THERE WHO IS A CITIZEN. AND MY PARENTS WERE UNDOCUMENTED WAS A BURST LOW BUT THAT REALLY IS IT. SOME PERSONAL BURNOUT WHAT BORN ON ONE SIDE OF THE BORDER THE OTHER ON THE OTHER. AND MY STORIES GOT IT MY STORY IS NOT DIFFERENT THAN ANYBODY ELSE'S. MY PARENTS CAME HERE HAD ME. YEAH THEY GOT THE PORTED. THAT HAPPENS. AND WE END UP BACK IN NEXT. THEY CAME BACK AND HAD MY BROTHER. YEAH BUT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THEM TO COME HERE. THANK KALINKA BABY AND WE'VE HEARD ONE YOU KNOW IT'S UP FINE WHATEVER YOU KNOW. BUT BUT THE POINT IS YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT JUSTICE AND FOR ANYBODY WHO MIGHT BE CONCERNED. AND I THINK ANYBODY SAID HERE. ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO GO AFTER AN INDIVIDUAL ONES ARE BEING RELEASED LET ME BE VERY CLEAR THE BILL ALLOWS FOR WARPED. IT'S SEXIST IT SETS A STANDARD FOR THE BAR YOU GOT TO GO THROUGH JUDGE GOTTA GET A FEDERAL ONE IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN. AND THAT WARRANT WOULD ALLOW FOR ANY OF THE CONCERNS THAT ANYONE HAS ABOUT GOING FOR THE PICKING UP ANY PERSON- ONES ARE BEING RELEASED. SO IF THERE IS A BONAFIDE CONCERNS. ON THAT INDIVIDUAL. THAT THAT THAT IS OUTSIDE OF THEM SERVING THEIR TIME. ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS A BILL TO GET A WARRANT ONCE I GOT THAT WARRANT TAKE PICKING UP LIKE ANYBODY ELSE SAME WAY THE SAME WAY AS I READ I BELIEVE IN SB FIFTY FOUR. ALL WE'RE SAYING IS. IT JUST CANNED IT JUST CAN'T BE GAME ON ANY TIME SOMEBODY GETS OFF. AND GO PICK PEOPLE UP IN COURT IN COURT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR ALLOWING ME TO TAKE HIM TO MAKE THAT COMMENT. YOU SEE VERY MUCH BUT I WOULD URGE EVERYBODY TO SUPPORT IT BECAUSE IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE IF YOU GO SUPPORTER STARTED JUSTICE GOT SUPPORT FOR ALL. LET ME. MAKE A SUGGESTION IN THIS KIND OF CLARIFICATION AND MAY EVEN HELP- DOES THAT. I JUST HAVE SOME CONCERNS BOB WHEN THIS BILL OR THIS IDEA CAME TO ME LAST YEAR I HAD THE SAME CONCERNS AND- WHEN I CALLED DAN RALPH DEUS. WHO IS SECRETARY OF CDCR AND I SAID IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT EVERY IMMIGRANT DASH RELEASED OUT OF CDCR CDC ARE ACTIVELY CALLS BODIES. TO HAVE THEM SIT OUTSIDE PICKED THEM UP AND TAKE THEM TO WHICH HE SAID THAT IS. ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE. HE SAID THE PROCESS IS. EVERYBODY HAS TO BE RELEASED HOWEVER. A FEDERAL WARRANT SUPERSEDES ANYTHING WE WANT TO DO SO I SUPPORT FBI CIA ANTI TERRORIST GROUP IF THEY CAN COME IN WITH A FEDERAL WARRANT WHICH INCLUDES GETTING A JUDGE INTERNAL. THAT PERSON THEN THEY HAVE TO GIVE THAT OVER TO TODAY IT'S SO WHITE I THINK WE PROBABLY NEED TO CHECK FOR HOPEFULLY HE GIVES SOME ASSURANCE. TO MEMBERS HERE THAT IF THAT IS THE CASE THAT NO MATTER WHAT YOU MAY THINK WE'RE DOING IN THIS BILL IT COULD BE SUPERSEDED BY FEDERAL LAW THAT WE HAVE TO TURN A PERSON OVER EVEN WITH A FINAL. WARNING FOR WHATEVER SO I WOULD LOVE FOR THIS TO GET OUT TO MEET AND GET SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS ANSWERED. I WOULD SAY NOT TO FURTHER CONFUSE YOU. BUT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT. NCDC ARE THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE. THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE SERVED THEIR TIME. FOURTEEN YEAR OLD WHO GOT INVOLVED IN GANGS THERE NOW FORTY FOUR YEARS OLD TOTALLY REPENTANT DID GO OUT TO ALL EVERYTHING THEY BELIEVE THAT PERSON GENERALLY IS NOT HAMPERED BUT NOW I'M HEARING FROM THE AUTHOR. WE MAY NEED SOME CLEAN UP LANGUAGE TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO NO LONGER PRESENT. A RISK TO SOCIETY HAVE GONE THROUGH ALL OF THE PROGRAM AND NOW ALSO LEAVE YOU WITH THIS. GIVING PROBATION AND OUT OF PRISON IT'S HARD I LIKED IT YOU HAVE NO CLUE WHAT HOOPS YOU NEED TO GO THROUGH TO GET OUT OF PRISON THROUGH THESE PROGRAMS THESE ARE NOT. CAKEWALK IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AND I'VE HEARD THAT FROM EVERY. EVERY PART OF THEM. OF THE CORRECTIONS GROUP IT IS IT IS NOT A CAKE WALK DRIVE I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO BELIEVING THAT THAT PEOPLE JUST **** NILLY LETTING PEOPLE OUT THAT IS DEAD THERE IS A PROCESS AND MAYBE THAT MAY BE PART OF THIS EDUCATING. EVERYBODY ON HOW DIFFICULT THIS PROCESS IS- BECAUSE CDCR DOES NOT. WANT TO LET SOMEBODY LOOSE. AND THEN THEY FIND OUT LATER DO SOMETHING REALLY HORRENDOUS BECAUSE GUESS WHERE THAT COMES BACK ON TO THE INSTITUTION AND SO THEY PROBABLY GO A LITTLE OVERBOARD TO ENSURE THAT- NOBODY JUST GETS OUT. IN FRONT FOR NOTHING. SO I THOUGHT. IF THERE'S NO MORE QUESTIONS YOU MAY CLOSE AND THAT'S KIND OF MY CLOSE TO THAT THAT WE- THAT WE- THAT WE MOVE ON AND THAT YOU KNOW WITNESSES GO AFTER THIS. SO THERE'S PEOPLE GET. HOW MANY MORE THAN THAT. OKAY SO THIS WILL GO THROUGH JUDICIARY WHICH PROBABLY HAVE EVEN MORE QUESTIONS. AND THROUGH- TO APPROACH SO WE CAN HAVE MORE DEBATE WE CAN BRING GIVE YOU TIME TO ALLOW THE POLICE CHIEFS SHERIFFS AND ANYONE ELSE WHO IS CONCERNED ABOUT THIS SO WE CAN CLARIFY HOPEFULLY HOPEFULLY WHAT WE'RE DING IS CLARIFY- THAT WERE THIS IS NOT A PROGRAM TO ALLOW. PEOPLE TO STAY IN THIS COUNTRY WHO ARE. WHO COULD BE POTENTIAL. POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS WHICH IS WHAT. MR QUIRK IS CONCERNED ABOUT. AND I MOVED TO BILLS THANK SIX ON. MY CLOSE. YES THANK YOU- AND THANK YOU FOR THE ROBUST CONVERSATION I JUST I WANNA CONTINUE TO CLARIFY A COUPLE OF THINGS THE VISION ACT WILL CONTINUE TO ALLOW THE JOINT TAX TASK FORCES IF THEY ARE CRIMINAL- ENFORCEMENT IF THEY'RE FOR CRIMINAL ENFORCEMENT PURPOSES NOT AN IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT PURPOSE THAT IS A KEY DIFFERENCE THE VISION ACT WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO ALLOW FOR CRIMINAL WARRANTS I THINK THAT WAS A QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED THE BILL DOES NOT STOP ICE FROM DOING THEIR JOBS AS THEY DO ON AN EVERYDAY. ULTIMATELY THIS IS ABOUT JUSTICE AND AN EQUAL JUSTICE SYSTEM FOR ALL. THE QUESTION IS DO YOU BELIEVE IN A JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT. IF AN INDIVIDUAL HAS SERVED THEIR TIME SHOULD THEY BE ALLOWED TO COME BACK INTO SOCIETY THAT IS THE BASIC FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION ABOUT THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE TRYING TO CREATE A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL NOT A CALIFORNIA FOR SOME. WERE BASED ON THE COLOR OF YOUR SKIN OR YOUR NATIONAL ORANGE ORIGIN YOU ARE JUDGED DIFFERENTLY. THAT IS NOT THE PILLAR OF THE STATE. MEMBERS I HAVE SAID BEFORE AND I'LL JUST SHARE AGAIN. I AM A FORMALLY UNDOCUMENTED CHILD IN THIS COUNTRY. MY FAMILY FLED A CIVIL WAR. THERE WERE MANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR ME TO DO WRONG WHEN I WAS GROWING UP AND I DID BUT I WAS FORTUNATE TO HAVE A LOT OF SUPPORT WHERE I WAS GROWING UP. AND I BELIEVE THE REPRESENTATION MATTERS. WE MUST ENSURE. THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS THAT HAVE SERVED THEIR TIME. WON'T BE DENIED THE OPPORTUNITY TO REUNITE WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND HAVE A SECOND CHANCE OF LIFE SIMPLY BECAUSE- THEY DID SOMETHING WRONG. PAID THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY OR BECAUSE OF WHERE THEY WERE BORN. AB NINE THREE SEVEN DIVISION ACT WILL HELP ACHIEVE THAT. I AM GRATEFUL FOR THE CONVERSATION AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO PERCENT. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD AND GET IT RIGHT THANK YOU. AND SAID CALL THE ROLL. ON AB NINE THREE SEVEN BY SOME MEMBER CARILLO THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER HI LACKEY. LACKEY NO BARRICADE HAND CORK. QUARK HI SANTIAGO SANTIAGO I SEE ARE TO KNOW THE R. TEN WICKS. LEE HI LEE I. THE MEASURE ON CALL ME AND MARK THANK. AND I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN PATIENTLY WAITING MISSOURI. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY ALL RIGHT THANKS TO- MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I HEARD YOU CALL MY NAME. AND I MISSED IT SO THAT COST ME THREE HOURS RIGHT. TODAY I'M HERE TO PRESENT- AB TWO SIX EIGHT WHICH WILL PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF MY MURDERED CONSTITUENTS WHO DIED IN THE BORDERLINE MASS SHOOTING. AB TWO SIX EIGHT IS BASED ON EXISTING LAW. THAT ALLOWS FAMILIES TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF THEIR MURDERED LOVED ONES AND IS BALANCED WITH THE VAST MAJORITY OF RECORDS THAT WILL REMAIN IN PUBLIC. AFTER THE EVENTS OF THE BORDERLINE MASS SHOOTING THE LAW ENFORCEMENT DESICCATION THE PUBLISHED REPORTS BY THE DA AND SHERIFF. AND MULTIPLE NEWSPAPER STORIES THESE FAMILIES CONTINUE TO BE TORMENTED BY CONSPIRACY THEORISTS. REQUESTING AUTOPSY RECORDS. THERE AND TEND TO OR DISTORTING THE MEMORY OF THESE VICTIMS THROUGH HURTFUL AND OUTRAGEOUS CLAIMS ON MESSAGE BOARDS. CLAIMING THAT THE VICTIMS OF MASS SHOOTINGS ARE CRISIS ACTORS AND ARE ALIVE AND LIVING OVERSEAS. WE'VE SEEN IT WITH THE CHILDREN OF SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY AND THE PAYTON'S WROTE. THE PATRONS OF THE PULSE NIGHTCLUB BASELESS THEORIES THAT TWIST THE LAST MOMENTS OF A CRIME VICTIM'S LIFE INTO CLICK BAIT. AB TWO SIX EIGHT AMENDS AN EXISTING LAW THAT ALREADY ALLOWS FAMILIES OF MURDERED CHILDREN. TO PETITION A COURT TO HAVE THEIR CHILD'S AUTOPSY SEALED. ALLAWI PASS AFTER THE KIDNAPPING RAPE AND MURDER OF A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD TELLS YOU CAME. OVER THE PAST DECADE THAT LAW WITH ITS IMPORTANT SAFEGUARDS HAS NOT RESULTED IN THE BERING ABOUT BARRING OF ACCESS TO THE VAST MAJORITY OF CHILD'S AUTOPSY RECORDS. IT WOULD ONLY APPLY IF A CRIMINAL ACT CAUSES THE DEATH OF THE VICTIM. AND THE PERPETRATOR IS CONVICTED OR THEY ARE ALL DEAD. I WANT TO STRESS THAT AB TWO SIX EIGHT ONLY APPLIES TO A DEATH THAT IS THE RESULT OF A CRIMINAL ACT NOT OF NATURAL CAUSES AN ACCIDENT. OR ONE THAT IS SELF INFLICTED. SIMPLY EXTENDS THE OFTEN ALREADY OFFERED TO FAMILY MEMBERS OF CHILD VICTIMS WHO DIED OF A CRIMINAL ACT TO VICTIMS OF ALL AGES. THIS BILL RISK RETAINS THE CRUCIAL SAFEGUARD- FROM THE EXISTING LAW THAT IS STILL COULD NOT BE REQUESTED UNTIL AFTER A CRIMINAL CONVICTION IS SECURED. HOWEVER IT ADDS THE IMPORTANT ALTERNATIVE THAT IS STILL TO BE SOUGHT AFTER CASES CLOSED BY PROSECUTORS DUE TO ALL SUSPECTS BEING DECEASED. AFTER ALL NO CONVICTION WILL EVER BE SECURED AGAINST THE MASS SHOOTER WHO TAKES HIS OWN LIFE AS WAS THE CASE AT BORDERLINE. I AM HONORED TO HAVE JOINING ME IN SUPPORT BY PHONE TODAY ELIZABETH ESPINOSA REPRESENTING VENTURA COUNTY. AND MARK OR FUN AS THE FATHER OF TELEMARKETER FINEST. WHO WAS KILLED IN THE BORDERLINE MASS SHOOTING IN MY DISTRICT. ALONG WITH ELEVEN MOSTLY COLLEGE AGE YOUNG PEOPLE. MOVE THE BILL. OKAY DO WE- TO HAVE A SUPPORT WITNESSES EIGHTEEN T. OPERATOR. WE DO HAVE THE WITNESSES YOUR LINE THEY'RE OPEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THIS IS A LIST OF AT ASPEN US ON BEHALF OF THE VENTURA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THE SPONSOR OF AB TWO SIX EIGHT AS OUTLINED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER IRWIN THIS BILL OFFERS AND NARAL EXPANSION TO EXISTING LAW. GIVING QUALIFIED FAMILY MEMBERS OF MURDER VICTIMS AN AVENUE TO ENHANCE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS WITH RESPECT TO AUTOPSIES AND RELATED EVIDENCE THE COUNTY'S INITIAL INTEREST IN SEEKING A CHANGE IN LAW GREW OUT OF THE COUNTY MEDICAL EXAMINERS EXPERIENCE WORKING IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS INCLUDING THE STATE OF OREGON. AND HIS OBSERVATIONS ABOUT DIFFERENCES IN THE LEVEL OF PRIVACY PROTECTION POST DEATH. AS DISCUSSED IN THE COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY EXPIRES AT DEATH IN CALIFORNIA BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE AND DOZENS OF OTHER STATES WHERE THE BALANCE TIPPED IN THE FAVOR OF THE DECEDENT AND THEIR DIPPED SURVIVING FAMILY MEMBERS. DEFINITENESS ADDITION REPORTS CONTAIN EXPENSIVE PRIVATE AND HIGHLY SENSITIVE INFORMATION. MUCH OF WHICH MAY ULTIMATELY HAVE NO BEARING ON THE CAUSE AND MANNER OF DEATH BUT IS INCLUDED. TO PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE PROFILE OF THE DECEASED. ITEMS THAT ARE CONFIDENTIAL IF FOUGHT WHEN THE PERSON IS LIVING ARE NOT PROTECTED WHEN A PERSON HAS DIED AND AN AUTOPSY CALLED FOR. VENTURA COUNTY POLICE THIS DISPARATE TREATMENT OF RECORDS IS WORTHY OF THE LEGISLATURE'S CONSIDERATION. AND THE BORDERLINE CASE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE UNDERSCORE THAT THE FULL DEPTH INVESTIGATION RECORDS HAVE ALREADY BEEN RELEASED. BOTH FOR CERTAIN HE WAS AND THE BORDERLINE SHOOTER. NEITHER RECORD WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR ENHANCED PRIVACY PROTECTIONS EVEN IF AB TWO SIX EIGHT S. PROPOSED WERE ALREADY ENACTED. IT'S ALSO CRITICAL TO NOTE WHAT REMAINS EXPLICITLY ACCESSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC UNDER EXISTING LAW AND UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF AB TWO SIX EIGHT. SPECIFICALLY THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE DEATH CERTIFICATE INCLUDING THE DECEDENT'S NAME AGE GENDER RACE. AND OF COURSE IMPORTANTLY THE CAUSE AND MANNER OF DEATH AMONG OTHER DETAILS. ALSO ONE CHANGE THIS ACCESS BY SPECIFIC AGENCIES AND INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE A LEGAL OR INVESTIGATORY NEED TO ACCESS THE RECORDS. INCLUDING VENTURA COUNTY COUNTY RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THIS COMMITTEES POSITIVE CONSIDERATION OF A MODEST BUT NECESSARY CHANGE TO RESISTING LAW. A CHANGE THAT DOES NOT AS SOME OPPONENTS SUGGEST THROW THE DOOR OPEN TO A WHOLESALE EXEMPTION TO THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. THE NARROW IMPACT OF THE BILL HAS BEEN VASTLY OVERSTATED IN VARIOUS ADVOCACY PIECES AND OPPONENTS OF OFFERED EXAMPLES WHERE IT'S CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT AB TWO SIX EIGHT WOULD NOT AND COULD NOT APPLY. INCLUDING COVERT RELATED DEATHS AND DRUG OVERDOSES. A COUNTY VENTURA SINCERELY APPRECIATE ASSEMBLYMEMBER OWENS LEADERSHIP. AND WE STAND WITH THE BORDER LINE FAMILIES AND SEEKING THIS NARROW BUT IMPORTANT CHANGE TO LOS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY DO WE ALSO HAVE A MARKER FINALS ON THE LINE AS A WITNESS. YES YEAH THIS IS SEEKING HEARING YES PLEASE PLEASE PROCEED YEAH. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MARCO FINALS. I'M FROM THOUSAND OAKS CALIFORNIA AND IS FORTY BE TWO SIXTY EIGHT I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT BILL THE WILL PROVIDE A DEGREE OF PRIVACY AND PROTECTION TO VICTIMS OF VIOLENT CRIMES. THIS PROTECTIONS ALREADY AFFORDED OF VICTIMS UNDER AGE EIGHTEEN AND THIS BILL WILL EXTEND THAT PROTECTION TO VICTIMS EIGHTEEN AND OVER. MY SON TELEMARKETER. HELLO WITH ELEVEN OTHERS WITH CHILDREN BASH HERE ON NOVEMBER SEVENTH TWENTY EIGHTEEN AT FORTY ONE BORN GIRL HAS PREVIOUS PREVIOUSLY STATED AND SINCE THAT DAY WE HAVE STRUGGLE WITH CONSTANT DEPRESSION ANXIETY AND DESPAIR AS OF TODAY THERE'S BEEN EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE DAYS. SINCE I WAS LAST TO HUG MY SON'S HERE IS VOICE AND SEE YOUR SMILE SMITH EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE DAYS OF CONSTANT HEARTACHE AND TORMENT. IT IS A NIGHTMARE THAT DOES NOT END AND BECAUSE OF THE VERY PUBLIC NATURE OF MY SON'S DEATH WE SUFFER ADDITIONAL TRIBULATION WE HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO MALICIOUS AND CALLOUSED LETTERS. EMAILS INTERNET POSTS FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE ACCESS TO OUR INFORMATION ONLINE THIS IS A CRITICAL REASON TO PROTECT CERTAIN AUTOPSY RECORDS. ONE CERTAIN INFORMATION BECOMES PUBLIC IT BECOMES FODDER FOR TROLLS CONSPIRACY THEORISING COPY CATS AND IT SERVES NO PUBLIC GOOD. PLEASE CONSIDER THE IMPACT THIS HAS ON VICTIMS FAMILIES MY YOUNGER SON DID NOT GO TO SEE HIS. BODY AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO DRAMATIC MANY OF THE FAMILIES OF BORDERLINE VICTIMS HAVE DELIBERATELY AVOIDED THE DETAILS OF THEIR LOVED ONES DEATHS. AS THE SPECIFICS YOU TO HORRIFIC. AND CONSIDER. THE HUNDREDS OF OTHER PEOPLE THAT WERE THERE THAT NIGHT. THEY ARE TRAUMATIZED THEY ARE SUFFERING AS IS OUR COMMUNITY AT LARGE IF THIS INFORMATION IS ARBITRARILY RELEASED. IT WILL ENDANGER THE MENTAL HEALTH. OF COUNTLESS PEOPLE NOW I UNDERSTAND THERE MIGHT BE CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION IS NECESSARY. AND AS PREVIOUSLY STATED AB TWO SIXTY EIGHT ACCOMMODATES THOSE CONCERNS. PLEASE REMEMBER WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HUMAN BEINGS PLEASE DON'T REDUCE OUR LOVED ONES IT'S JUST A STATISTIC OR PIECE OF EVIDENCE MY SON IS NOT JUST A NAME ON THE PAGE. DESPITE HIS BEING KILLED HE IS STILL A PERSON HE'S STILL MY SON AND ALWAYS WILL BE HE DESERVES PRIVACY AND PROTECTION AND DIGNITY. SLASH I THINK WE HAVE SUFFERED ENOUGH I IMPLORE YOU RESPECT OUR DEAD HELP MITIGATE OUR SUFFERING AND DIVORCE AB TWO SIXTY EIGHT.

I IT- I LIKE TO KNOW A LOT- THERE FORTY MINUTES UNDER BETWEEN THE- WHEN PERSON OR I AT THE BAR AND THE BOARD JUDY HAS THAT CAN FULLY ACCOUNT CORD THE TOP RECORDS NOT THERE RELEASED THERE'S ELEVEN THAT WERE.

OF COURSE I WOULD ECHO THE SENTIMENTS THAT THE SPORT OUR SOCIETY HAD ABOUT THE FAMILY MEMBERS OF THE VICTIMS YOU KNOW I'M VERY SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT- I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS OFFICE FLOOR OUR DISCUSSIONS BUT UNFORTUNATELY. THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION REMAIN SUPPOSED TO A BE TO SIXTY EIGHT. FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS- IT UNDERMINES SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE LANDMARK LEGISLATION THIS BODY CHEST PASSED THREE YEARS AGO WHICH- AMENDED THE PENAL CODE TO REQUIRE THAT POLICE OFFICER AN AGENCY RECORDS. SPECIFICALLY INCLUDING AUTOPSY REPORTS FROM POLICE INVOLVED KILLINGS ARE NOT CONFIDENTIAL AND AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION UNDER THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. AND ON THE SAME PIECE OF LEGISLATION ALSO GAVE TO THE AGENCY THE ABILITY TO READ JACK DOES- AUTOPSY REPORTS AS APPROPRIATE. S. FOUR TWENTY ONE WAS PASSED BEFORE THE NATIONAL OUTRAGE IN THE WAKE OF THE TORCH FLOYD AND BRIANNA TAYLOR KILLINGS THAT'S FOLLOWED AN EARLIER WAVE OF HIGH PROFILE POLICE SHOOTINGS AND KILLINGS THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO WHITTLE AWAY OR CHIP AWAY AT SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE. ALSO I WOULD ADD THAT THIS IS NOT. THIS IS BAD PUBLIC POLICY BECAUSE IT TAKES THE ABILITY TO BALANCE THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO KNOW AGAINST THE PRIVACY INTERESTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL. AWAY FROM NEUTRAL JUDGES AND GIVE THE FEATHER PARTY TO PRIVATE CITIZENS AND POLICE OR PROSECUTORS- WE KNOW FROM. ASKED WE HAVE THE EXAMPLE OF THE AUTOPSY OF ANDRES. GUARDADO IN ASIA A YOUNG MAN WHO THE MEDICAL EXAMINER EXAMINER DETERMINED WAS SHOT IN THE BACK FIVE TIMES AND KILLED BY A LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPUTY. MAJORITY LEASING ME ON HER LAPTOP YES YEAH THIS IS AN EXAMPLE. AND WHERE YES I'M GOING TO WRAP UP THIS IS AN EXAMPLE WHERE THIS- SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE IS VITAL SO WE WOULD- THIS IS A DECISION BETTER LEFT TO THE COURTS AND THERE'S ON GOING LITIGATION BATTLE REGARDING THE BORDERLINE VICTIMS AUTOPSY REPORTS. HELLO CPD A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU.

HELLO GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING MY CALL AND THANK YOU FOR EVERYONE THAT IS LISTENING TO THIS TODAY WHO WILL BE AFFECTED BY THIS TODAY AND WHO'S TAKEN THE TIME CARE AND CONSIDERATION TO LISTEN. MY NAME IS LINDA LEWIS MILLER I AM HERE TODAY REPRESENTING A WING OF JUSTICE WITH AN ORGANIZATION THAT I STARTED AFTER MY BROTHER DAVID EDWARD LEWIS WAS MURDERED EACH DAY. THEY MURDERED. IT WE HAD TIME FOR HIS NAME AN ORGANIZATION. SUPPORT IN YOUR IN SUPPORT CORRECT. HELLO. DO WE LOSE OUR. I THINK WE GOT YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION. SO THANK YOU. UNDER ANY OTHERS AT&amp;T I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT THANK YOU AT THIS TIME OKAY THANK YOU ANY WILL BRING YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS- REBEKAH POWER K. AND THEN MISTER ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE. AND THEN- MISS SHE'S AFTER THE FLEX. WELL I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL. MINISTERS THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL I THINK YOU KNOW I HAVE A CONSISTENT. RECORD OF VOTING FOR TRANSPARENCY I THINK TRANSPARENCY IS TANTAMOUNT TO WHAT WE DO AND WHAT THE GOVERNMENT DOES- AND I HAVE SUPPORTED MISS SCANNERS WORK ON TRANSPARENCY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT BEING SAID. I THINK THAT YOU HAVE CRAFTED A BILL HERE THAT DOES WHAT VERY FEW BILLS THAT COME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE DOES WHICH IS PROTECT VICTIMS. AND THESE INDIVIDUALS AND MISTER FINAL I WANT TO SPEAK DIRECTLY TO YOU AS A PARENT I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE THE LOSS YOU FEEL. AND THE FACT THAT YOUR CHILD WILL FOREVER BE YOUR CHILD WAS OVER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN DENIED YOU THE RIGHT TO THIS PROTECTION IS WRONG. FULL STOP. AND YOU KNOW THIS IS A VERY VERY NARROWLY CRAFTED BILL. AND I WANT THAT TO BE A DOES IT ONLY APPLY IN A VERY NARROW SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES ONE IN WHICH SOMEBODY HAS BEEN CONVICTED. OF THE CRIME AT ISSUE OR THE PERSON WHO COMMITTED THE CRIME IS KNOWN TO BE DECEASED. SO MANY OF THE EXAMPLES GIVEN BY THE OPPOSITION. AREN'T RELEVANT OR SOMEONE IS ALLEGED DIED OF AN OVERDOSE. THERE IS NO CRIMINAL ACT WITH SOMEONE WHO HAS JUST BEEN DECEASED OR- CONVICTED OF A CRIME SO IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE THIS BILL WOULD NOT APPLY. THE SAME IS TRUE OF MR JUST COMMENT. OF OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS AND LEFT THE OFFICER HAD BEEN CONVICTED. OR THE OFFICER IS DECEASED IN WHICH CASE. THE TRANSPARENCY IS THERE RIGHT THE VINCE OFFICERS BEEN CONVICTED OF THE MURDER WHY DO YOU NEED. IN THAT CASE THE PERSONAL DETAILS OF THESE PERSON THESE PEOPLE OF LIFE THAT FEELS. THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN VICTIMIZED IN THE WORST POSSIBLE WAY. WE TO VICTIMIZE THEM AGAIN BY ALLOWING THE PERSONAL DETAILS OF THEIR LIFE AT THE TIME OF THEIR DEATH TO BE RELEASED. THAT FEELS. TO ME JUST WRONG AND I WANTED TO JUST SPEAK TO THE ISSUE BECAUSE I THINK THAT. THERE WAS A LOT OF DISINGENUOUS COMMENTS MADE BY THE OPPOSITION WHERE THE BILL WOULD NOT APPLY. AND I THINK THAT THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT STEP. IN PROTECTING PEOPLE WHO HAVE PAID. A PRICE THE NEW. WANTS THEIR LOVED ONE TO PAY AND SO THE- THE SIMPLE ACT OF PROTECTING THEIR PRIVACY AND DEATH FEELS. RIGHT AND JUST AND I WANT TO AND I'M EXCITED TO SUPPORT THE BILL AND I WOULD LIKE TO ADD AS A CO AUTHOR. THANK YOU MISTER LEE. I JUST WANT TO ECHO SOME OF- SIMILAR ABOUT CANS COMMENTS ABOUT IT AND I AND I REALLY THINK- SIMILAR WOULD FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE AND WORK WITH ME TO UNDERSTAND THE NARROWNESS OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL CERTAINLY I DON'T WANT THIS BILL TO UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND MESS UP THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE WITH SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE BUT CAN I ASK THE OPPOSITION THAT'S ON THE IF THEY'RE STILL ON THE LINE LIKE. BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THE BILL AND AS SOME OF OUR CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT'S ONLY POST CONVICTION AND POST DEATH OF PERHAPS AN OFFICER SO HOW DOES THIS INNER WITH SB TWENTY ONE AND THERE BUT I'M STILL TRYING TO UNDERSTAND OUR. SO AFTER THAT. YES PLEASE. YES YES PLEASE- OKAY. OKAY SO WHAT. ON MY END IS THAT IN THE WALL SHE- IN THE- FIRST AN OFFICER ONCE- FRIENDLY FIRE AND IT TOO I UNDERSTAND ALTHOUGH I GUESS IT'S STILL YOU KNOW THAT'S PART OF THE REASON THE AUTOPSIES ARE AT ISSUE THERE'S AN ISSUE OF WHETHER OR NOT. SOME OF THE VICTIMS WOULD HAVE DIED BUT FOR THE DELAY IN THE POLICE RESPONSE. SO THAT I BELIEVE I'LL GO TO THE PUBLIC. INTEREST REASONS THAT THESE PARTICULAR AUTOPSIES ARE AT ISSUE AND YOU KNOW NO ONE I DON'T THINK ANYONE KNOWS THE ANSWER TO THOSE QUESTIONS EXCEPT THE CORNER. WHAT UP PERHAPS AND NOT THE BORDERLINE SITUATION THE MORE TYPICAL POLICE MISCONDUCT CASE OR CIVILIAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN MURDERED BY POLICE WHICH IS WHY SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE IS ULTIMATELY GOING FOR. MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE PRESIDENT BUSH POTTERY THE BILL GIVES BIRTH FAMILY MEMBERS BUT POWER TO HEAL THE AUTOPSY- AND- WHILE THEY MAY NOT LAST A FAIRLY. LATE REQUESTED YOU THAT AND THAT AND THEN SOME OF THESE INVOLVED SHOULD IT. DOWN BY MY READING GIVES THEM THE POWER. TO DO SO. I THINK THE THRISSUR AND MISS. WICKS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AS WEARING- AS A MEMBER IRWIN IF YOU COULD ACTUALLY ANSWER THE QUESTION OF YOUR INTERPRETATION OF YOUR BILLS IMPACT ON US SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE YEAH SO- BUT WITH- SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE OBVIOUSLY HUGELY IMPORTANT- WHAT SB OF FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE DOES IS IT IMMEDIATELY MAKES ALL THE INFORMATION WE ARE ABLE. SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE CONVICTION SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE IS ALREADY IN PLACE AND THAT IS FOR YOU KNOW SPECIFICALLY WHEN- OFFICER- DISCHARGES FIREARMS AT A PERSON AND THEN THE I WOULD I WOULD ALSO- YOU KNOW I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU ALMOST TAKING MY- MY CLOSING FOR ME. THE EXAMPLES THAT THEY ARE THAT THE BOTH THE PUBLISHERS AND THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS ARE CITING ARE NONE OF THEM ARE AFFECTED OF BY SB TWO TWO SIX EIGHT AND SO IT IT AGAIN THIS IS VERY NARROWLY TAILORED AND I WILL ALSO SAY THAT THERE ARE TWENTY STATES THAT THINK THESE RECORDS ARE SO PRIVATE THAT THEY SHOULDN'T BE RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC. AND ALL AND BOOK BETWEEN SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE- AND THE VERY- NARROWNESS OF THIS BILL THERE ARE ONLY A FEW- RECORDS THAT ARE GOING TO BE PROTECTED AND SO FROM THE FREEMEN YOU'RE AT AND IT MUST BE REQUESTED BY A FAMILY THAT RIGHT AND SO FROM YOUR INTERPRETATION. YOUR BILL WOULD NOT OVERRIDE SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE THAT'S RIGHT OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER C. R. TO. RIGHT FIRST I WANT THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING A BILL LIKE THIS- YEAH ISSUE HITS A LITTLE BIT CLOSER HOME. WENT TO CALDERON. AT THE TIME. YEAH IT WAS PRETTY SCARY. BUT FORTUNATELY THAT WASN'T THE NIGHT THAT SHE CHOSE TO GO OUT WITH HER FRIENDS. UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS THE NIGHT FOR THIS VICTIM THAT WE HEARD ON THE PHONE. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. THIS ABOUT PROTECTING VICTIMS AND TOO MUCH IN HERE I HEAR ABOUT NOT PROTECTING VICTIMS. SO WHEN YOU BRING A BILL LIKE THIS TO PROTECT VICTIMS. I'M GOING TO SUPPORT IT. BECAUSE BECAUSE THERE IS NO REASON. TO CONTINUE THAT TRAUMA FOR PEOPLE LIKE THAT GENTLEMAN THAT WAS ON THE PHONE. OVER AND OVER AND OVER IN MY CAREER I'VE SEEN THIS IT'S GROSS. PEOPLE USE THIS I USE THIS FOR SENSATIONALISM TO SELL THEIR THEIR PAPERS THEY USE IT TO EXCEL- YOU KNOW IT IT DID IT DID DID GAIN NOTORIETY BASICALLY FOR THEIR WEBSITES AND THINGS LIKE THAT PARENTS CAN'T CONTINUE TO BE TRAUMATIZED BY THINGS LIKE THAT SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS AYE CONTENT TO SUPPORT IT AND- I THINK IT'S NARROW ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THAT WITHOUT INFRINGING ON THE OTHER- THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR ANY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBER. IT THANK YOU MISTER LUCKY. YEAH I WANTED TO THE WITNESS WHO SPOKE EARLIER- THANK YOU FOR HAVING THE COURAGE TO BRING. SOMETHING FOR DO YOU KNOW. I'VE BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE FOR SOME TIME NOW AND HOPEFULLY WILL CONTINUE TO BE FOR A PERIOD OF TIME BUT WHAT ONE THING I WILL TELL YOU THAT'S VERY CONSISTENT. UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S THAT'S VERY. SALIENT FACT VICTIMS GET OVERSHADOWED. AND THE CONSIDERATIONS THAT ARE BROUGHT FORWARD HERE. AND IT'S VERY HEARTBREAKING ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HEAR THAT PARENT. I'VE SEEN TOO MANY. TRAGIC CIRCUMSTANCES. WHERE THE VICTIM GETS FORGOTTEN AND I'M JUST THANKFUL YOU BROUGHT THIS FORWARD BECAUSE- THIS PRIVACY PROTECTIONS. ARE SO NARROW HOW CAN YOU VOTE AGAINST THIS. I THANK YOU FOR THIS. THANK YOU ARE ANY OTHER MEMBERS REDDING. YOU MAY CLOSE. WELL I THINK THE COMMENTS HAVE BASICALLY MADE MY- CLOTHES FOR ME I WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO. I'VE NEED TO ITEMIZE MY HEART IS WITH YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER SWORE TO THERE WERE MANY MANY OF US IN THOUSAND OAKS THAT NIGHT. THAT HUG OUR CHILDREN BECAUSE THAT WAS THE NIGHT THEY DECIDED NOT TO GO TO BORDERLINE AND I ALWAYS WILL ALSO WANT TO SAY ON THE TRANSPARENCY ISSUE WE HAVE. SEEN HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF PAGES RELEASED ON WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED SECOND BY SECOND. AND SO I JUST REALLY RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS THIS BILL THAT'S IT- WILL HELP. FAMILY MEMBERS PRESERVE THE PRECIOUS REMAINING MEMORIES THEY HAVE OF THEIR LOVED ONES. THANK YOU YOU'RE WELCOME IN. FIRST CALDERON. ON AB TWO SIX EIGHT BY THE MEMBER IRWIN THE MISSION IS TO PASS TO THE PRIVACY COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER NOT BOATING JONES SAWYER NOT VOTING BLACKIE BLACKIE AND BARRICADE HAVE AND CAN I WORK HARD WORK ACCENT IAGO. THEY ARE TERRIFIED ARE TO WAKE. WEEKS I. LEE NOT VOTING HELPS GIVE ME LEAD TIME. THE MEASURE PASSES. AND NOW WILL HAVE MISSED TOM LOGGER. AB. THREE THREE THREE. PARTICIPATION IN A CRIMINAL STREET GANG ENHANCE SENTENCE. WE USUALLY DON'T ALLOW SENATORS TO GRACE OUR PRESENCE. BEFORE IT'S THEIR TIME BUT SINCE YOU'RE A FORMER MEMBER OF TO STEAM COMMITTEE WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW AN EXCEPTION- THANK YOU I'M PRETENDING. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. HI JUST ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTES. I KNOW HI- FLOOD YOU ALL FOR. I WATCH THIS COMMITTEE- HERE PUTTING IN THE HOURS MY FRIENDS- I WILL JUST SAY DURING MY TENURE AS A MEMBER OF THE PENAL CODE REVISION COMMITTEE THIS PAST YEAR I'VE LISTENED TO OVER FIFTY HOURS OF TESTIMONY DETAILING ISSUES. WITH A NUMBER OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE STATUTES AND ONE STEP STEP ONE SUCH STATUTE WAS THE STEP STEP ACT RELATING TO GANG ENHANCEMENTS THE MATTER WAS SO PRESSING. AND THE INJUSTICES SO EGREGIOUS THAT REVISIONS TO THE STATUTE WERE ONE OF TEN RECOMMENDATIONS THE COMMITTEE SUBMITTED TO THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE RESULTING IN THIS BILL. CURRENTLY GANG ENHANCEMENTS ARE OFTEN USED FOR PHYLLIS LEE AND DISPROPORTIONATELY AGAINST PEOPLE OF COLOR. BLACK AND LET NEXT PEOPLE COMPRISE 92% OF THE PEOPLE SENTENCED. UNDER OURS CALIFORNIA GANG ENHANCEMENT STATUTE IN IN LOS ANGELES MY COUNTY THAT NUMBER IS 98% YET RESEARCH BY THE JUSTICE POLICY INSTITUTE SHOWS THAT WHITE PEOPLE MAKE UP THE LARGEST GROUP OF YOUTH GANG MEMBERS AND AS THEY MATURE. THEY WILL BE AN ADULT GANGS. IT IS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE A STATUTE ESPECIALLY ONE THAT IMPOSES CRIMINAL PUNISHMENTS WITH THE MORE DISPARATE RACIAL IMPACT. THIS BILL MAKES CHANGES TO THE LAW THAT WILL REDUCE THE DAMAGING ARBITRARY AND RACIALLY MOTIVATED APPLICATION OF GANG ENHANCEMENTS. IN CRIMINAL CASES AND MAKES THE STANDARDS FOR APPLYING A GANG ENHANCEMENT MORE RIGOROUS I JUST WANT TO STATE. THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT SEEK TO MAKE THE APPLICATION OF A GANG ENHANCEMENT IMPOSSIBLE AS WAS WRITTEN IN SOME OF THE LETTERS NOR DOES IT ELIMINATE IT ENTIRELY IT WOULD REQUIRE THAT SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE BE PROVIDED WHICH IS WHAT I THINK WE ASK FOR. IN ALL INSTANCES AND IT WOULD ENSURE THAT GANG ENHANCEMENTS ARE APPLIED TO THE SERIOUS AND VIOLENT OFFENSES AND WHERE IT CAN BE PROVEN THAT THE PATTERN CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR. DIRECTLY CORRESPONDS WITH THE GANG AFFILIATION. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE CLEAR LIMITATIONS AND DELINEATIONS WHEN WE ARE ALLEGING. GANG INVOLVEMENT AND CURRENTLY WE HAVE JUST THE OPPOSITE WE HAVE VAGUE DEFINITIONS WE HAVE WEAK STANDARDS OF PROOF. WE KNOW THAT THESE GANG ENHANCEMENTS COME AT A STEEP FISCAL AND HUMAN COSTS TO OUR COMMUNITIES. AND THEY ARE RACIALIZED TOOL THREADED BY FEAR OF GANG AND GANG MEMBERSHIP TO SENTENCE BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE TO LONGER PERIODS OF TIME BEHIND BARS. THIS BILL WOULD IN THE ABILITY OF PROSECUTORS TO CLAIM PEOPLE ARE GANG MEMBERS SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY COME FROM THE SAME COMMUNITY. OR KNOW EACH OTHER OR ARE RELATED IT WOULD PROHIBIT THE USE OF THE GANG THE CURRENT CHARGED OFFENSE AS A PROOF OF PATTERN IT WOULD. REMOVE CERTAIN. VIOLATIONS FROM THE LIST OF PREDICATE OFFENSES. AND IT WOULD REQUIRE DIRECT EVIDENCE HOW ABOUT THAT AND BIFURCATE DIRECT EVIDENCE OF GANG INVOLVEMENT FROM THE GUILT DETERMINATION AT TRIAL. HERE WITH ME AND SUPPORT ARGUE CERRO HERRERA OF THE YOUNG WOMEN'S FREEDOM CENTER AND CHESAPEAKE DEAN DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.

AND HER LEADERSHIP AND COMMITMENT ON THIS CRITICAL CHANGE IN LAW. ALSO LIKE ACKNOWLEDGE AND THANK MUCH SPEAK AND WITNESS TODAY MISTER HEADED. FROM THE ELEMENTARY CENTER A CRITICAL. IN BUILDING SAY. ENCAMPMENTS AND BEYOND. ONE OF MY FIRST POLICY DIRECTOR ON TAKE NOT. WAS TO END THE USE STATUS YES THE SPECIFICALLY GETTING ATTACHMENTS AND ESTABLISH A POLICY BASED ON A PRESUMPTION THAT THE SENTENCE FOR THE UNDERLYING CRIME AND THE ABILITY TO CHARGE APPROPRIATE CONDUCT ENHANCEMENTS. ARE ADEQUATE TO HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE AND PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY IN FACT IT WAS A KEY CAMPAIGN PROMISE I MADE TO THE PEOPLE OF SAN FRANCISCO DURING THE CAMPAIGN HERE IN TWENTY NINETEEN. STATUS SO AND GUESTS INCLUDING GANG ENHANCEMENTS SUCH AS THE ONES ADDRESSED IN THIS LEGISLATION. OUR LEGACY OF CALIFORNIANS FAILED TOUGH ON CRIME ERA IN THERE THIS YEAR OLD NATIONAL CORPORATION. IT DIFFERENTLY IMPACT AND YOU USE A COLOR WITHOUT MAKING IT SAFER BUT WELL BANKRUPTING STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND DEPRIVING THEM OF RESOURCES NEEDED. TO INVEST IN AREAS LIKE HEALTH CARE EDUCATION THAT WE KNOW CAN PREVENT CRIMES ADULT. STATIONS ACTIONABLE COMMUNITIES. SB THIRTY THREE. THREE THREE THREE PIPELINE A RIGOROUS STANDARDS THE CURRENT LAW. BY HOLDING US ALL THE HIGHER CAN. ENSURE THAT GANG ENHANCEMENTS NO LONGER CONTRIBUTE TO OVER AND CORPORATIONS TO HORRIFIC RACIAL DISPARITIES IN DISPROPORTIONATE. PUNISHMENTS GETTING HERE PLENTY HAVE BEEN Y. USED APPROACH CRITICIZED FOR. TARGET BLACKS AND BROWN POPULATIONS PARTICULARLY YOUNG MEN OF COLOR. RECENT ANALYSIS BY THE LOS ANGELES CARDS SUGGESTS THAT THE CAL GAME DATABASE IS WOEFULLY OUTDATED- HORRIFICALLY INACCURATE AND RIGHT WHICH WOULD BE USED UP SOME INSTANCES OF PEOPLE BEING ENTERED FOR ANY REASON OR NO REASON AT ALL WITH THE KIND OF LIFE ALTERING CONSEQUENCES THAT YOU JUST HEARD INSTEAD OF. TESTIFIED TO. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION DATA FROM TWENTY NINETEEN MORE THAN NINETY PERCENT. OF ADULTS WITH A GANG ENHANCEMENT IN STATE PRISON WERE EITHER BLACK OR LIGHT NEXT MORE THAN NINETY PERCENT. ACCORDING TO FLORIDA LAW PROFESSOR JOHN PASSED AN EXPERT IN CRIMINOLOGY WHO HAS STUDIED THE CAUSES AND EFFECTS OF MASS INCARCERATION. QUOTE THERE IS A STRONG EMPIRICAL SUPPORT FOR DECLINING TO CHARGE THE STATUS AND HENCE MINTS. LONG SENTENCES IMPOSED BY STRIKE LAWS AND GANG ENHANCEMENTS PROVIDE LITTLE ADDITIONAL DETERRENCE. OFTEN INCAPACITATE LONG PAST WHAT IS REQUIRED BY PUBLIC SAFETY. IMPOSE SERIOUS AND AVOIDABLE FINANCIAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH COSTS IN THE PROCESS. AND MAY EVEN LEAD TO GREATER RATES OF OFFENDING IN THE LONG RUN END QUOTE. THAT'S ABOUT AS PASSAGE LANE THAT WOULD RESEARCH A GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE BASED STUDIES HAVE MADE CLEAR THAT WHAT ACTUALLY DISCOURAGED AND PREVENTS VIOLENCE AND OTHER ANTI SOCIAL BEHAVIOR IS NOT THE THREAT OF A LONG SENTENCE IMPOSED AT SOME POINT IN THE DISTANT FUTURE. ONLY IMPOSED IN THOSE CASES THE MINORITY REPORT FRANK ABOUT WHAT THE CRIME DATA SHOWS US WHERE A CRIME GETS REPORTED RESULTS IN ARREST AND ARREST THERE'S ALSO NO CHARGE NO CHARGE RESULTS IN A CONVICTION KNOW WHAT ACTUAL DETERS FAR MORE EFFECTIVELY. IS THE RISK OF DETECTION AND APPREHENSION IN THE FIRST PLACE POLICING THE CARS INVESTMENT IN COMMUNITY AND BUILDING STRONG FAMILIES TO TURN LONG SENTENCES. DO LITTLE. AB THREE THREE THREE WELL KILLED SEXUAL ONE EIGHT SIX TWO TWO LINDA COLUMN. FIRST IT WILL END THE ABILITY OF MY FELLOW PROSECUTORS CLAIM TO KEEP GETTING WORSE ASSEMBLY. THEY MAY COME FROM THE SAME COMMUNITY. WHICH OTHER. FOR IT COSTS. ADDITIONALLY IT WILL PRINT USE OF THE CURRENT CHARGE DEFENSE AS PROOF OF A QUOTE UNQUOTE PATTERN OF CRIMINAL GANG ACTIVITY IT WILL FURTHER REMOVED SPECIFIC CRIMES FROM THE LIST OF PREDICATE OFFENSES AND ALLOW GANGS EXPENSE TO BE CHARGED APPROVING. IT WILL REQUIRE DIRECT EVIDENCE OF CURRENT ACTIVE GANG INVOLVEMENT IN VIOLENCE AND IT WILL BIFURCATE DIRECT EVIDENCE OF GANG INVOLVEMENT FROM THE GUILT DETERMINATION AT TRIAL IN OTHER WORDS IT WILL HOLD ALL OF US TO THE HIGH STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC DESERVES. IT WILL HELP IN THAT WAY TO REBUILD CONFIDENCE AND TRUST IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND IT WILL HELP RESTORE SOME OF THAT REALLY BADLY DAMAGED RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE HAVE SWORN TO SERVE AND PROTECT. NOT GETTING HITS WHICH HAVE BEEN WIDELY CRITICIZED AS UNFAIRLY TARGETING BLACK AND BROWN POPULATIONS FOR GOOD REASON. THIS IS A HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO HOLD OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS TO THE HIGH STANDARDS AND OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR JUDGES AND OUR JURIES DESERVE AND EXPECT FROM US IN THIS DAY AND AGE.

ANYONE IN OPPOSITION I HAVE PROJECTION DIVISION CHIEF OF THIS IDEA COUNTY DA'S UNIT. AND CAL COREY CELL ZERO CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION. YES THIS IS A FRIEND JACKSON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE- I AM THE CHIEF THIS ANY KIND OF GANG PROSECUTION DIVISION I'VE BEEN AGAIN PROCTOR FOR FIFTEEN YEARS I'M APPEARING TODAY ON BEHALF OF CDA TO OPPOSE AB THREE THREE THREE. I BECAME AGAIN PROSPERITY ADVOCATE FOR FAMILIES IN OUR MOST UNDERSERVED AND UNDERPRIVILEGED NEIGHBORHOODS WERE BEING FORCED TO LIVE THEIR LIVES IN FEAR FOR THEIR CHILDREN- THAT THEIR CHILDREN WOULD EITHER BE RECRUITED INTO GANGS OR THEY'LL BECOME TARGETS OF GANG VIOLENCE ENGINE TO BECOME A VICTIM OF GANG CRIME THEY CANNOT TURN TO THE POLICE BECAUSE EVEN IF THE PERPETRATOR WERE CAUGHT. THE REMAINDER OF THE GANG WOULD SEE TO IT THAT THEY PAID A PRICE IT'S TO PROTECT THESE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WITH A MAJORITY OF GANG VIOLENCE OCCURS THE GANG PROSECUTION AND THE GANG ALLEGATION IS VITALLY IMPORTANT IT ALLOWS ASIDE YOU TO ATTACK THE EVIL IT IS THE GANGS GRIP ON THE PSYCHE AND SAFETY OF THE COMMUNITY AND IT'S SENSELESS. VIOLENCE GANGS BRING WITH THEM. SAN DIEGO HAS BEEN ONE THE SAFEST. CITIES IN. AND THE COUNTRY. DUE IN LARGE PART COURSE. AND FOCUSED. ON TARGETING GANG VIOLENCE. PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT IN ITS CURRENT FORM THIS BILL WILL EFFECTIVELY KILL THE GANG ALLEGATION. GREATLY AFFECTING PUBLIC SAFETY OF SAN DIEGO AND CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. WHAT WE OPPOSE ANY WHOLESALE GUTTING OF THE GANG ALLEGATION WE DO APPRECIATE WHAT THE LEGISLATORS TRYING TO DO IN TIGHTENING ITS SCOPE. NO ONE QUARRELS WITH THE CURRENT LAW TO GIVE JUDGES THE POWER TO STRIKE GANG PUNISHMENTS WHEN APPROPRIATE. AND SOME AMENDMENTS PROPOSED BY AB THREE THREE THREE ARE PROBABLY WARRANTED. THE SHRINKING OF THE LIST OF CRIMES ELIGIBLE TO BRING A PATTERN OF GANG ACTIVITY AND THAT'S A DIVISION II. WHAT EFFECTIVELY LIMIT THE ALLEGATION GROUPS WHICH COMMIT CRIMES OF VIOLENCE OUR TOP PRIORITY. DISALLOWING THE CURRENT CRIME TO BE USED TO ESTABLISH A PATTERN OF OFFENSES. I WOULD FIRST FOCUS ON MORE ESTABLISHED AND ENTRENCHED GANGS. AND A PART TIME FOR MORE EVIDENCE TO BE GATHERED BEFORE CALLING A GROUP AGAIN. THE LEGISLATURE MAY ONE CONSIDER LIVING THE CRIMES WHICH AGAIN ELEVATION MAYBE ALLEGED. THE ONLY TRYING TO QUALIFY IS THREATENED. CRIMES THEREBY CONTINUE TO SUPPORT AND PROTECT OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. BUT MANY OF THE OTHER PROPOSED AMENDMENTS SHOULD NOT BE ADOPTED THREE IN PARTICULAR. LOOKING FURTHER THE PROPOSED CHANGE SUBDIVISION HE WANTS REQUIRED TO BE PROVEN THAT THE OFFENSE BENEFIT LEAST ONE SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED MEMBER OF THE GANG. OTHER THAN THE PERPETRATOR AND THE BENEFIT ME MORE THAN REPUTATIONAL. THIS AMENDMENT FUNDAMENTALLY MISUNDERSTANDS GANG CRIMES. THE REALITY IS THAT MANY GANG CRIMES FOLLOW A PATTERN SUCH AS- A FEW BLOOD GANG MEMBERS GATHER ONE MORE GUNS AND GET INTO A CAR AND THEY DRIVE INTO RIVAL PREPARE STORY. DO YOU LOOK FOR A GROUPOF YOUNG BLACK MALES GATHERED NEAR THE STRONGHOLD OF THE RIVAL GANG AND HE OPENED FIRE ON THOSE MAILS OPENED THEIR RIVALS BUT NOT WORRYING TOO MUCH OF THE ART. MAY SHOOT INDISCRIMINATELY. THEY ENGAGE THIS MURDEROUS ATTACK TO BOLSTER THE REPUTATION OF THE SHOOTER ANYONE THE PRESIDENT IN THE CRIME. TO RAISE THE REPUTATION OF THE GANG WITH THE RIVALS BY SHOWING THEIR WILLINGNESS TO INFLICT DEATH IN THE HEART OF ANY TERRITORY. TO VISUALLY DEMONSTRATE THE POWER AND FEARLESSNESS OF THEIR GANG TO RIVAL NEIGHBORHOOD. AND CAL THE LAW ABIDING CITIZENS FROM COOPERATING WITH POLICE NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND THE VIOLENCE BEGAN CAN AND WILL DO. VIOLENT CRIMES THOSE CRIMES WE SHOULD CARE ABOUT MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT CARRIED OUT TO BENEFIT A SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED PERSON OR FOR REASONS BEYOND RESPECT AND REPUTATIONAL BENEFIT. IN VIOLENT CRIMES OR WHAT HOLDS FAMILIES AND NEIGHBORHOODS HOSTAGE. GET THE ABOVE DESCRIBED CRIME WOULD FALL OUTSIDE THE PROPOSED AMENDED GANG STATUTE. AND SUCH A PERVERSE CONSEQUENCE CANNOT BE THE INTENTION TO FALL. SIMILARLY THE NEW REQUIREMENTS SUBDIVISION J. ONE THAT WE PROVE THAT THE DEFENDANT MUST PERSONALLY KNOW THE PERSON WHO COMMITTED THE PREDICATE OFFENSE. IN CHECK THE REQUIREMENTS WHICH WILL BE TO THE DETRIMENT OF DEFENDANTS. IT EXPLICITLY REQUIRES US TO TIED TO SENT TO THE PREDICATE CRIMES AND GANGSTERS. CURRENTLY GANG PROSECUTORS AND JUDGES ARE VERY CAREFUL AND EXPLICIT WHEN TALKING WITH JURIES THE PREDICATE OFFENSES HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CURRENT DEFENDANT AND MERELY ARE REQUIRED TO BE PROVEN IN ORDER TO LEGALLY CALLED QUALIFY THE GROUP. AS A CRIMINAL STREET GANG. REQUIRING PROOF OF THE DEFENDANT'S CONNECTION TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CONVICTED THE PAST WOULD. HAVE DEFENSE ATTORNEYS LIKE TO SAY NOTHING MORE THAN YES. HELLO YES OOPS YES THEY BEGIN. I'M SORRY I THINK SOMEBODY GOT ON INCIDENTLY- OKAY TELL THEM HOW MAY I. MALCONTENT YOU MISTER CHAIR YES PLEASE DO. REQUIRING PROOF OF THE DEFENSE CONNECTION TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CONVICTED THE PAST WHAT IF DEFENSE ATTORNEYS ARE WANT TO SAY DO NO MORE THAN THIRTY UP THE DEFENDANT WHICH IS NO ONE'S INTENTION. ADDING ESTABLISHED HIERARCHY REQUIREMENT AS AN CURRENTLY ENVISIONED BY THE CHANGES HAVE BEEN HALF WOULD DO NOTHING TO ADDRESS VIOLENT CRIME BUT INSTEAD WOULD ONLY SERVE TO REQUIRE MORE GANG EVIDENCE BE PRESENTED TO A JURY IN AN EFFORT TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS AND WOULD ULTIMATELY PLACE OUTSIDE THE REACH OF THE CALIFORNIA GANG STATUTE MOST VIOLENT CRIMES COMMITTED BY CRIMINAL STREET GANGS IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE FRANKLY THEY DON'T OPERATE WITHIN ESTABLISHED HIERARCHY. REGARDING A PROPOSAL TO BIFURCATE THE PROOF OF THE GANG ALLEGATION STRICTLY BY FORGETTING ALL GANG EVIDENCE IS NOT POSSIBLE GANG CRIMES OFTEN FALL INTO THE CATEGORY OF OTHERWISE INEXPLICABLE THE AVERAGE TO REMEMBER GIVEN THAT THE MOTIVES OF SO MUCH VIOLENCE ARE COMPLETELY TIED UP AND GANG IDENTITIES AND GANG RULES. MOREOVER GIVEN THE INCREASED COSTS AND CORD INJURY TIME THAT SUCH BIFURCATED TRIALS WOULD REQUIRE I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE THIS BILL IS NOT CURRENTLY DESIGNATED TO BE CONSIDERED BY THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE BECAUSE IT'S PRICE TAG WILL NOT BE SMALL. INTEREST OF KEEPING FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AS SAFELY POSSIBLE CAN WE ARE TO VOTE NO ON AB THREE THREE THREE. THANK YOU MISTER JACK THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN CHORUS ALTHOUGH. HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION- REGRETTABLY IN OPPOSITION TO AB THREE THREE THREE. KNOWING THE COMMITTEES RULES ON TIME FOR TESTIMONY- I SEATED MOST OF MY TIME TO- MISTER JACKSON. BUT JUST WOULD AGAIN HIGHLIGHT THE- CONCERNS ABOUT- NOT BEING ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE.

AT THIS TIME THERE'S NO ONE ELSE TO MAKE YOU. THANK YOU BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS. SEEING AND HEARING NONE. ARE YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU IF YOU DON'T MIND MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE- STATEMENTS THAT WERE A- SHARED DURING THE OPPOSITION IN MY CLOTHES- I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THIS WILL NOT. KILL GANG ENHANCEMENTS EFFECTIVELY THAT WAS STATED IT WILL ASK PROSECUTORS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT TO DO THEIR JOB I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE ASK OF EVERY SINGLE ENTITY IN STAKEHOLDER WHEN WE ARE LOOKING AT POLICY- TO NOT RELY ON AN ARCANE RACIALIZED TOOL FOR SHORT CUTS. SO THAT WE CAN BE LAZY IN THE COURTS WHEN DUE PROCESS AND CIVIL LIBERTIES AND RIGHTS ARE SO VERY IMPORTANT. THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO SERIOUS AND VIOLENT OFFENSES WE TOOK THAT OUT. CD EIGHT CERTAINLY NEVER CAME TO THE AUTHOR TO TALK ABOUT ANY OF THE CONCERNS SO THAT WE COULD HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL- THEY MENTIONED THAT THIS WOULD BE COSTLY COSTLY COSTLY PLEASE OUT. AND SO IT WOULD NOT BE COSTLY. AND YET IT IS STILL REALLY IMPORTANT TO BIFURCATE OUT YOU CAN TRY. ON TWO INSTANCES. YOU CAN CHARGE FOR THE CRIME. AND TRY THAT OR PLEA IT OUT AND THEN GO BACK IF THERE'S AN ALLEGATION OF GANG ALLEGATION. BUT INTERLINKING THEM. IS NOT HELPFUL IT HAS GOTTEN US TO THE STATISTICS THAT WE HAVE NOW. IT WAS STATED THAT D. A.'S DO SEPARATE ONE CHARGE FROM THE OTHER THAT IS NOT TRUE. YOU GO INTO COURT. AND YOU SAY THIS PERSON SHOT SOMEONE THIS PERSON STOLE SOMEONE IN THE JURY SAYS PROVE IT SHOW ME THE EVIDENCE. THEN YOU SAY IN THIS PERSON AS A GANG MEMBER. AND BECAUSE WE HAVE WATCHED TRAINING DAY AND COLORS AND MINISTER SOCIETY AND THE WIDER. IT TRIGGERS ALL OF OUR FEARS WE SAY- BAD. BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE GANGS. AND THEY KNOW THEY DO THAT. MISTER JACKSON. AND HE SHOULD HAVE A SIDE JOB WRITING IN THE MOVIES. I WAS USING THE SAME TACTICS THAT HAVE GOTTEN US TO WHERE WE ARE NOW FEAR. FEAR. THIS WOULD WHAT DID HE SAY. ATTACK THE EVIL THAT IS HURTING THE PSYCHE OF OUR COMMUNITIES NO ONE WANTS GAINES HURTING THEM TERRORIZING THEM. BUT THIS DOES SAY YOU HAVE TO PROVE THAT SOMEONE IS IN A GANG AND NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY WEAR CERTAIN COLORS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN CAMERON TERRELL. WAS WEARING A BLUE BANDANNA BLUE TEE SHIRT THROWING UP SIGNS. TO INSIGNIA ROLLING AROUND IN A CAR AND WAS SHOOTING PEOPLE KILLED PEOPLE. MONAKER MILK AND WHY BOY HE WAS IN A GANG OKAY. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT GETTING ALLEGATION NOT LIVING ON HIM. HE WAS WHITE FROM PALACE THIRTIES. HE SAID I WAS JUST DOING A DOCUMENTARY WANTED TO SEE WHAT IT WAS LIKE IN THE LIFE. RAYMOND. HAPPEN TO BE IN A GAME THE AVERAGE GANG MEMBER GETS SENT OUT FIFTEEN GETS OUT OF TWENTY FOUR. BUT BECAUSE OF OUR LAWS. YOU ARE NEVER ALLOWED TO NOT BE AGAIN IF YOU'RE IN A GAME. AND SO WAS LOSE SEVERAL POINTS WE MAKE YOU APPLY TO BE ON THE REGISTRY EVERY YEAR. WHEN YOU ARE NOT IN THE GAME ANYMORE RAYMOND WAS IN A GANG. STOLE FROM THE CONVENIENCE STORE A TALL CANNOT BE YEAR AND SOME MILK HE DID NOT STEAL THAT. BECAUSE HE WAS A GANG MEMBER. HE WASN'T STEALING IT AT THE BEHEST OF THE GAME. HE STOLE IT BECAUSE HE WAS THIRSTY AND HE HAD A CHILD WHO NEEDED MILK. AND A GANG ALLEGATION WAS LEVIED ON HIM. SO IF THERE WERE CONSISTENCIES I WOULDN'T BE HERE. MISTER JACKSON. BUT THERE ARE. SO BIFURCATE THE ISSUES CHARGE THEM AS SUCH. BUT LET'S NOT RELY ON LAZY TOOLS. LET'S PUT OUR BIG BOY BIG GIRL PANTS ON. AND FIND THE EVIDENCE TO CHARGE APPROPRIATELY. THAT IS WHAT AB THREE THREE THREE IS ASKING I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU SENATOR- WE HAVE A MOTION. OKAY THE WE HEAR YOU. AND THE CHAIRS RECOMMENDED I BOTH CALLED CALDERON ON AB THREE THREE THREE BY SENATOR COMMA- THE MOTION IS TO PASS JONES SAWYER JONES SAWYER IRAQI. OUR QUE HAN. BACKHAND I CORK CORK I SANTIAGO.

OF FOUR YEARS IN PRISON IF THEY INSTEAD FREE SO THAT THEY'RE INTOXICATED STATE CAN CANNOT BE PROVEN THEY FACE A MAXIMUM SENTENCE OF FOUR YEARS. IN THE CASE OF THE INDIVIDUAL WHO HIT AND KILLED GAVIN GLAD OF. BELOVED TEACHER AN EDUCATOR IN THE FRESNO WHERE. HE WAS SENTENCED TO THREE YEARS AND SERVED LESS THAN EIGHTEEN MONTHS CONVERSELY THE YOUNG MAN IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY NOT LONG AGO WAS GIVEN A TWELVE YEAR SENTENCE.

THE HUMANE THING AND THERE IS THIS PERVERSE REWARD IF YOU FLEE AND LEAVE. SO TO CLOSE THE LOOPHOLE AB FIVE EIGHT TWO WOULD BRING THESE TWO SENTENCES CLOSER TOGETHER BY INCREASING THE SENSE FOR FLEEING THE SCENE OF AN ACCIDENT RESULTING IN DEATH. FROM THE CURRENT POSSIBLE SENTENCE OF. TWO TO FOUR YEARS TO A POSSIBLE SENTENCE OF. THREE FOUR FOUR SIX. AND HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS READ THE GLADDING.

AT THAT POINT THE FRESNO BEE HEADLINE ON TUESDAY OCTOBER THE SIXTEENTH TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN READ IN BOLD PRINT.

IT WAS REALLY TRAGIC REALLY TERRIBLE BUT- YOU DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW TRAGIC IT HOW TERRIBLE UNTIL IT HAPPENS TO YOUR FAMILY- MY SISTER KOURTNEY OUT SKATED WAS KILLED IN FEBRUARY. I HIT RUN DRIVER SHE WAS WALKING OUT TO WORK. ON THE WEIGHT OF A CAR- SOMETHING SHE OTHER PEOPLE DO EVERY SINGLE DAY NOT KNOWING IT WOULD BE THE LAST THING. THAT SHE DID. A SPEEDING DRIVER. CROSSED IN THE WRONG LANE SORRY FIXING THE CAMERA LITTLE BIT- CROSS IN THE WRONG LANE. AND HIT MY SISTER SO HARD THAT SHE CAME OUT OF HER SHOES AND SHE WAS LEFT THERE TO DIE. THE DRIVER DIDN'T STOP TO SEE IF SHE WAS OKAY. DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE COMPASSION TO DO THAT. MY SISTER WAS THIRTY ONE. THE DRIVER TOOK HER AWAY FROM MY FAMILY. TOOK HER AWAY FROM HER SEVEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER. AND DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE DECENCY TO STOP. THIS WASN'T AN ACCIDENT THIS WAS A RECKLESS CRIME. THE DRIVER HAS BEEN ARRESED YET EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY LOCAL POLICE- WHEN THE DRIVER IS ARRESTED THE MAXIMUM PUNISHMENT THAT SHE'LL FACE IS FOUR YEARS. IS THAT FAIR FOR MY SISTER'S LIFE. THE FAIR FOR A FAMILY'S GRIEF. FOR MY NIECE WHO NOW HAVE TO LIVE WITHOUT A MOTHER. THIS IS AN INSTANCE WHERE THE SCALES OF JUSTICE JUST SEEM OUT OF WHACK. AND GAVIN LAW HELPS FIX THAT. THE PUSH A HARSHER PENALTY ON IT RUN DRIVERS WHO COMMIT THESE TERRIBLE CRIMES AND DON'T HAVE THE DECENCY TO STOP AND CARE FOR THE PEOPLE LIVE UNDER. WE CAN ALL AGREE THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR REPRESENTS THE WORST OF OUR SOCIETY. ALL HIT RUN VICTIM'S DESERVE BETTER THAN THAT. CAVENDER IS BETTER THAN THAT AND MY SISTER DESERVE BETTER.

THE LOSS OF A LOVED ONE IN THE WAY THAT THAT YOU LOST YOUR LOVED ONES- AND I TRULY DO OFFER MY SYMPATHY ON YOUR LOSS- I THINK WE ALL SHARE THE GOAL OF TRYING TO MAKE OUR ROADS SAFER AND TRYING TO PREVENT- ON THIS KIND OF EVENT FROM OCCURRING AND- STOPPING PEOPLE FROM. FLEEING THE SCENE OF AN ACCIDENT. UNFORTUNATELY THE INCREASED TERMS OF IMPRISONMENT PROPOSED IN EIGHTY FIVE EIGHTY TWO WILL DO NOTHING TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS OR SERIOUS INJURIES FROM CAR ACCIDENTS. NOR WILL IT DETER DRIVERS FROM LEAVING THE SCENE AFTER AN ACCIDENT- PEOPLE LEAVE THE SCENE AFTER AN ACCIDENT BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY ARE GOING TO GET AWAY AND NOT BE PUNISHED THEY'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT WHAT THE- BUT THE COULD POSSIBLE PENALTY COULD BE. PERSUADING HERSELF STAY IN- EIGHTY FIVE EIGHTY TWO WILL ONLY SEND MORE PEOPLE TO PRISON FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME- WITH THE STATE OF COURSE PAYING THE INCREASED COST OF THAT AND NO BENEFIT TO PUBLIC SAFETY- BECAUSE IT WILL DO NOTHING TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM IT PROPOSES TO ADDRESS- WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE ON THE EIGHTY.

THANK YOU AT THIS TIME NO ONE ELSE AND LIKE YOU. THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE I THINK MR QUIRK HAS A COMMENT AND OR QUESTIONS ARE SO IT IS VERY IMPORTANT. THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN WE AS MEMBERS SHOULD BE HERE ALL THE TIME IN THESE HEARINGS. AND BE WILLING TO CHANGE OUR MINDS BASED ON WHAT WE HEAR. AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. WHEN MR PATTERSON BROUGHT THIS BILL UP. THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER POINTED OUT THAT IF YOU. WE'RE IN NEED AND- KILLED SOMEBODY IN AN ACCIDENT YOU WERE BETTER OFF LEAN. FROM THE SCENE OF THE CRIME. AND BEAN YOU WILL NOT BE PROSECUTED IS HARD WE HAVE TO HAVE CONSISTENT PUNISHMENTS. AND WE HEARD THAT AND WE CHANGED OUR OPINION AND AGAIN IT IS RARE FOR US TO INCREASE PENALTIES FOR THE REASONS THAT THE ACLU BROUGHT UP. BUT HERE THERE SIMPLE AS SIMPLE INCONSISTENCY IN THE LAW. AND WE UNDERSTOOD THAT WE CHANGED OUR MINDS IT TOOK A LITTLE WHILE BECAUSE PROVIDING ALL THAT FOR THIS TO COME BACK BUT IT'S HERE AND- THANK YOU VERY MUCH- ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON I THINK WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE- WITH THIS PARTICULAR PACKAGE THANK YOU. MATHIS CITY ZERO THREE. THANK YOU ARE THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- I'M GOING TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL- I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS THIS EFFORT TODAY TO ONE AND DECREASING CAR SERRATIONS AND THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE MOVEMENT. BUT THERE'S SOMETHING LSE HERE AND SOMETIMES IT'S NOT ABOUT FIXING IT'S NOT ABOUT FIXING THE PROBLEM A REHABILITATING IT'S ABOUT JUSTICE FOR THE PEOPLE THAT THIS AFFECTED. AND WHEN THERE'S AN INCENTIVE FOR SOMEBODY TO RUN OVER SOMEBODY ELSE AND JUST LEAVE THE SAME THERE'S A PRICE TO BE PAID FOR THAT AND THAT PRICE NEEDS TO BE PAID. FOR THE VICTIMS. OF THIS BECAUSE THAT IS A CRIME. AND IF YOU CHOOSE TO DO THAT CRIME. THOSE VICTIMS ARE THE ONES WHO DESERVE THE JUSTICE THIS BILL THAT YOU'RE PUTTING FORWARD. HELPS INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY WILL GET THEIR JUSTICE. AND SO IF YOU DON'T MIND I'D LIKE TO BE A CO AUTHOR ON YOUR BILL OF COURSE WHEN I WILL BE SUPPORT. THANK YOU. MR LEE. I WANT TO SHARE MY DEEPEST SYMPATHIES WITH THE GLIDING FAMILY IT'S TOO OFTEN IN EVERY COMMUNITY THAT WE LOSE SO MANY LIVES OF RECKLESS SPEEDING RECKLESS DRIVING EFFECT HAPPENS IN MY COMMITTEE PRETTY REFER TO ONLY AS WELL BUT I ALWAYS HAVE A PROBLEM WITH US TRYING TO SOLVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND TRANSPORTATION PROBLEM WITH THE PENAL SYSTEM BY HARPER PUTTING ON PENALTIES WITH PEOPLE. I MADE. WE HAVE STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT INCREASE PENALTIES INCREASE SENTENCING DOES NOT DETER BEHAVIOR IN FACT FOR EVERY ONE YEAR OF ADDITIONAL SENTENCING. INCREASES RECIDIVISM. THERE ALL THE DOOR OF THE PRISON SYSTEM FORTY SEVEN PERCENT. SO I UNDERSTAND OBVIOUSLY YOU WANT TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM HERE AND FIX AND MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE ELSE HAS TO LOSE THEIR LIVES SO. AWFULLY AND TRAGICALLY. BUT IS THERE ANY. DATA THAT PROVES THAT THIS METHOD YOU'RE GOING FOR ACTUALLY WILL SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF HIDDEN RUNS. WHAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT HERE IS FOR US TO SEE. THE IMBALANCE IN THE LAW. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ATTEMPTING TO DO. TO BRING THE. PENALTY IF YOU WILL. CLOSER TOGETHER AS I SAID EARLIER- THERE IS THIS GULF. BETWEEN LEAVING AND STAY. M. THE PENALTIES IMPOSED. BENEFIT THOSE WHO CHOOSE TO LEAVE. DATA NOT WAS STANDING I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO. THINK ABOUT THE FAX OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HIT KILL AND LEAVE. AND SERVE. A YEAR. THOSE INDIVIDUALS AREN'T SILENT. THEY HAVE FRIENDS. THEY TALK THEY COMMUNICATE. AND WHAT'S THE LESSON THEY LEARNED. THEY GOT OFF. WHILE GAVIN GLADDING WAS LYING ON THE STREET. WE ARE LOOKING HERE FOR A BALANCE OF JUSTICE. BETWEEN FLEEING AND STATING AND BEING A HUMAN BEING AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT SO I'M HEARING THERE IS NO EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ARE HAVING BETWEEN DETERRENCE AND SENTENCING. YOU AND I DISAGREE ON THAT WHY I'M ASKING IF YOU HAVE THAT IF YOU AND I DISAGREE ALL RIGHT WELL THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE THAT ARE GOING THROUGH CHAIR. DARK SERVICES CHANCER AND THE NO I'M JUST SAYING I WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE I AGAIN I THINK IT'S DOUBLING DOWN THE CARDINAL SYSTEM INSTEAD OF SOLVING INFRASTRUCTURE PROBLEMS. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS MR LACKEY. YEAH I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BACK I WOULD. GOOD WE'LL GET YOU. BECAUSE I HAVE WITNESSED UNLIKE ANYBODY ELSE UP HERE THE TRAGEDIES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS- A MILTON STATUTORY INCENTIVE TO FLEE. I MEAN IT DOESN'T TAKE. A STUDY AT DOZENS TAKE EMPIRICAL DATA. TO PROVIDE VERY COMPELLING- UNDERSTANDING OF HUMAN NATURE WHEN THERE'S THIS KIND OF INCENTIVE THAT IT'S GOING TO BE PURSUED AND IT IS ROUTINELY UNFORTUNATELY PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE HOW OFTEN THIS TAKES PLACE WHEN WE HAVE SERIOUS INJURY NOT ALWAYS RESULTING IN DEATH. BUT IT'S HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS EVERY YEAR. AND I'M HOPING THAT BY. PASSING THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT POSSIBLY. SOMEBODY REMAINING AT THE SCENE MIGHT EVEN SAVE SOMEONE'S LIFE. AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT SHOULD BE THE INCENTIVE FOR THIS BODY. IS TRYING TO PRESERVE AND PROTECT LIFE THAT DESERVES THAT. AND NOT TO WORRY ABOUT OVER PUNISHING SO I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND I WANT TO THANK MR PATTERSON AND- I THINK THIS CLADDING FOR COMING BACK I REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE HERE HE WAS TWO YEARS AGO IS THAT RIGHT MR PATTERSON. WITH YOUR DAUGHTER IN LAW AND HER POWERFUL TESTIMONY IN THE WAY HER LIFE WAS CHANGED ON THAT DAY AND- AS A MOTHER MYSELF I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE PAIN. GAVIN AND YOU KNOW I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE MR PATERSON ON THIS BILL WHEN YOU BROUGHT IT FOR TWO YEARS AGO I KNOW IN THE COMMITTEE HEARING I SAID I HAD A PROBLEM WITH YOU RAISING. THE FLOOR AND YOU HEARD THAT IN THIS BILL CONTINUES MAINTAIN THE FLORAL RAISING THE CEILING TO ENSURE THE PEOPLE LIKE THE GLIDING'S GET. THEIR JUSTICE AND I THINK IT'S THAT KIND OF WORK OR WE CAN COME TOGETHER AND HEAR EACH OTHER AND FIND COMPROMISE TO DO THE WORK TO GET JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS THAT IS WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN MORE IN THIS COMMITTEE SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTNERSHIP IN GETTING TO WHERE IT IS TODAY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER. COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SEEING NONE. YOU MAY CLOSE MISSED PATTERSON. THANK YOU MR I'M GOING TO CLOSE JUST BASICALLY WITH A BIG THANK YOU- THIS HAS BEEN. A LONG PERIOD OF TIME TOGETHER. SO I WANT TO FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU I THANK THE CHAIR THANK THE MEMBERS. WHO LISTENED. AND WHO HEARD AND HE THOUGHT ABOUT IT. I'M GRATEFUL FOR THAT- ALSO- I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO. I REMEMBER THAT ALTHOUGH THIS IS AN ENHANCEMENT. THIS IS A BALANCING BETWEEN THE PENALTY FOR STAYING IN THE PENALTY FOR LEAVING. AND WITH THAT I'M ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT. AND APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AGAIN AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR YOUR SUPPORT RECOMMENDATION. UNTIL JUST WHAT I WANNA DO IS JUST MAKE SURE WE UNDERSTAND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN BECAUSE THE BIG LEADING FAMILIES- TESTIMONY WITH VERY VERY. VERY POWERFUL FOR THOSE OF US THAT WERE HERE. BUT I DO REMEMBER. THERE WAS A COMMENT MADE AND I BELIEVE IT WAS THE FAMILY IS THAT IT MADE IT SOUND LIKE BASICALLY THAT PERSON HAD NOT BEEN GETTING THE CONSEQUENCES IT WAS LIKE A LOOPHOLE IN THE LAW AND YOU COULD LITERALLY SEE THE HEADS POP UP LIKE FROM EACH COMMITTEE MEMBER LIKE WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT AND THEN YOU KIND OF CLARIFY WHAT IT IS AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER WE KIND OF. WHICH WE NEVER DO WE'RE KIND OF CAUGHT CÃ¡C BETWEEN OURSELVES LET'S JUST WHAT'S GOING ON AND WE MADE A COMMITMENT TO COME BACK TO WORK ON IT SOME MORE AFTER IT IS- IT DIDN'T QUITE MAKE IT OUT OF COMMITTEE BUT WE MADE A COMMITMENT TO YOU THAT WE NEED TO FIX. THAT GAP. IN THE LAW NINE. THAT WAS FAST THAT'S REALLY WHAT HAPPENED NEXT IS JUST ONE OF THOSE TIMES. WHERE YOU LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE WHO SPEAK THEY TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT MAY BE. AN OBJECT ON STAFF TO SOMETIME STAFF MRS IN THE STAFF ANALYSIS. AND IT MAKES YOU GO OKAY THIS IS WHY OF TESTIMONY SO YOU CAN YOU CAN- YOU CAN MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION ARE YOU CAN HEAR SOMETHING THAT YOU DIDN'T HEAR BEFORE SIDE YOU KNOW IT IT'S GOOD THAT YOU YOU COOPERATED WITH US YOU UNDERSTOOD OUR DILEMMA. BUT MOST IMPORTANT. IT WASN'T REALLY- ABOUT THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF WHETHER YOU BELIEVE IN. HARSHER PUNISHMENTS OR EVEN WHEN YOU BELIEVE IN A REHABILITATION IT WAS ABOUT HOW DO WE MAKE SURE AT LEAST THAT PERSON SEARCH THE TIME THAT THEY SHOULD UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES NOT IN AND SO WE WORK REAL HARD TO TRY TO AT LEAST. AS YOU DIRECTOR MUSE TRY TO BALANCE IT AND SO THAT I THINK THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND HOPEFULLY IS A LESSON TO OTHERS. THAT YOU YOU WORK WITH US WE CAN WE CAN ACTUALLY GET PEOPLE THERE AND SO HOPEFULLY OF THE FAMILY TO GLIDING'S OR- GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING HOW THE SYSTEM. WORKS AND HOPEFULLY IT WORKS FOR THEM IN SOME WAY. SO I MISTER CHAIRMAN LAST WEEK FOR AN IPHONE. AT THIS- EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT- QUITE FRANKLY WILL CEMENT. ABOUT MY PERSONAL APPRECIATION M. THE RELATIONSHIP THAT WE HAVE. THAT TRANSCENDS PARTY AND TRANSCENDS IDEOLOGY THAT I WANT TO THANK THE STAFF AGAIN AND I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR I WANT TO THANK MEMBERS WHO SAW THE LOOPHOLE HELPED US. NAVIGATE THROUGH IT AND WE NOW ARE EVER ARRIVED HERE I'M GRATEFUL FOR THAT MASK FOR YOUR ON YOUR- CLOSELY. ON EIGHTY FIVE EIGHTY TO THE MISSION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYERJONES SAWYER HI LACKEY ARE. BARRICADE CAN BEAR CAN I WORK OUR WORK I SENT IAGO SANTIAGO I SEE R. TWO C. R. TWO I WICKS. LEE NOW LINO. THE MEASURE PASSES THANK THANK YOU. AFTER THAT MISS WALDRON. RIGHT NUMBER TWENTY- AB SIX FOUR FOUR MOVE THE BELL CALIFORNIA MATT REENTRY INCENTIVE PROGRAM. WE'LL STRT OFF WITH A- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AB SIX FOUR FOUR. MAKES MINOR CHANGES. TO MY BILL AB THIRTEEN OH FOUR FROM TWO TWENTY TWENTY WHICH IS TABLETS THE CALIFORNIA MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT ALSO KNOWN AS MATT RE ENTRY INCENTIVE PROGRAM THIS SLIGHT LANGUAGE CLARIFICATION IS BASED ON AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN MYSELF AND THE GOVERNOR GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S ADMINISTRATION ALONG WITH CDC ARE. SPECIFIC SPECIFICALLY AB SIX FOUR FOUR WOULD REFLECT THE TRUE INTENT OF THE CALIFORNIA MAT RIA ENTRY INCENTIVE PROGRAM. WHICH IS TO PROVIDE CREDITS TO PAROLEES WHO PARTICIPATE IN A POST RELEASE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT PROGRAM. AND IT INCENTIVIZES PAROLEES TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS BY PROVIDING REDUCE PAROLE SENTENCES. A SIMILAR BIPARTISAN MEASURE IN KENTUCKY HAS REDUCE RECIDIVISM. AND ILLEGAL DRUGS ALCOHOL OPIOID USE SAVING LIVES AND MONEY. GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S ADMINISTRATION AND I AGREE THAT THE PROVISIONS OF MY FORMER BILL AB THIRTEEN OH FOUR WOULD BE MOST IMPACTFUL IF PAROLEES ARE NOT EXCLUDED FROM ELIGIBILITY BECAUSE THEY DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN AN INSTITUTIONAL TREATMENT PROGRAM. SO THIS- THIS BILL CLARIFIES THAT AND INCENTIVIZES INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS TO PARTICIPATE IN POST RELEASE. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY PARTICIPATED IN TREATMENT WHILE IN CUSTODY SO. IT ELIGIBILITY TODAY JOINING ME ON THE PHONE IS DR KEITH HUMPHREYS A PROFESSOR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES AT STANFORD pMEMBER OF THE WHITE HOUSE COMMISSION ON DRUG FREE COMMUNITIES AND THE NATIONAL VICE THREE A COUNCIL OF THE U. S. SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND DURING. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HE SPENT A YEAR AS SENIOR POLICY ADVISER AT THE WHITE HOUSE OFFICE OF NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL POLICY- AND I WOULD. ALSO HAVE WITH US DR JOHN STERN CHIEF DEPUTY REGIONAL ADMINISTRATOR OF SOUTHERN REGION HEADQUARTERS. FROM THE DIVISION OF ADULT PAROLE OPERATIONS WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION AND HE IS HERE ONLY ON THE PHONE TO ANSWER AND PROVIDE ANY TECHNICAL- QUESTIONS IF NECESSARY. AND I'D LIKE TO HAND IT OVER TO DR HUMPHRIES. THANK YOU. BUT DON'T PLEASE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU- CHAIR JONES SAWYER THANK YOU VICE CHAIR LACKEY AND THANK YOU MINORITY LEADER WALDRON FOR- ASKING ME TO APPEAR DAY HI THIS IS A SIMPLE MODIFICATION OF THE BILL THAT'S ALREADY PASSED AND THE EVIDENCE IN THIS AREA IS VERY CLEAR SO I CAN BE CONCISE- HI STUDIED ADDICTION AND ITS TREATMENT FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS AND HERE'S WHAT I CAN BOIL DOWN- FOR YOUR COMMITTEE FIRST. WE'VE DONE MANY SURVEYS OF AMERICAN PRISONS AND THEY SHOW THAT THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN PRISONS MAKE CRITERIA FOR AN ADDICTION OFTEN MULTIPLE ADDICTIONS MOST OF THOSE FOLKS WLL ONE DAY BE ON PAROLE BUT THERE IS A VERY HIGH NEED. FOR THE SERVICE. SECOND I MEDICAID ASSISTED TREATMENT WORKS VERY WELL THESE ARE FDA APPROVED MEDICATIONS THERE STUDIED IN THE MOST RIGOROUS CLINICAL TRIALS THE SAME KIND OF RESEARCH WE DO TO DETERMINE HOW TO TAKE CARE OF CANCER. AND HEART DISEASE WE'VE DONE THOSE WITH HIS MEDICATIONS AND ACCOUNTS THAT GOES WITH THEM. THEY REDUCE THE RISK OF OVERDOSE THEY REDUCE THE RATE OF ILLICIT DRUG USE HE REDUCE THE CLINTON OF CRIME. AND REDUCE THE RISK OF PEOPLE EITHER REQUIRING FOR TRANSMITTING INFECTIOUS DISEASES LIKE HEPATITIS C. AND HIV. THERE'S ALSO A PUBLIC SAFETY BENEFITS HERE. PEOPLE WHO LEAVE PRESENT. AND GO BACK TO USING SUBSTANCES ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO COMMIT MORE CRIMES. AND THEN END UP IN PRISON AGAIN SO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE HEALTH OF THE- FORMER INMATE IS ALSO ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE COMMUNITY. LAST POINT AND NOT LEAST THE COST BENEFIT FOR THESE PROGRAMS IS EXTREMELY FAVORABLE. MY COLLEAGUES AT STANFORD AND I PUBLISHED A PAPER LAST WEEK IN THE JOURNAL OF AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION PSYCHIATRY. WHICH SHOWED THAT WHEN YOU PROVIDE I AM A T. TO AN OPIOID ADDICTED PERSON. OUR LIFETIME HEALTH CARE ACRYLIC JUSTICE COSTS ARE LOWER BY SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND AND A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. THAT'S BECAUSE MATT IS NOT VERY EXPENSIVE BUT A REDUCES THE LIKELIHOOD OF THINGS THAT ARE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE LIKE SOMETHING HAPPENED AND SOMEONE HAVING AN OVERDOSE GOING BACK TO EMERGENCY ROOM. FOR SOMEONE GOING BACK TO PRISON. SO THE EVIDENCE ON THAT AND IT IS QUITE CLEAR THAT THIS IS AN INTELLIGENT PROPOSAL THAT IS GOOD FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. AND GOOD FOR PUBLIC HEALTH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NOW GO TO THE ROOM ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ON TO THE VIDEO CONFERENCING ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. AND OUT TO THE TELEPHONE AT&amp;T RT OF ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

IN THE BILL MANY TERMS ARE ON OR POORLY DEFINED WHICH LEAVES THE BILL OPEN TO BROAD INTERPRETATION. CARROTS AND CLEAR AWAY FORM A TEAM REFERS TO WHEN A REFERENCE TREATMENT INCLUDING THAT NON MATTER INTEGRATED PROGRAMS RESIDENTIAL OR OUTPATIENT TREATMENT OR PUBLIC OR PRIVATE PAY FUNDED TREATMENT. THEREIS AN IMPORTANT QUESTION IS WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO STAY IN MEDICARE ON MEDICATION LONGER THAN THEIR POSITIONS MIGHT RECOMMEND. WE WOULD URGE YOU TO REWRITE IT FOR CLARIFICATION AND UNINTENTIONAL NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES. IN THE ROOM. IN OPPOSITION ANY WITNESSES STERN TELEX CONFERENCE QUICK STREAM IN OPPOSITION. AND NOW WE'LL GO TO EIGHTEEN T. DO YOU HAVE ANYONE ON THE LINE. IN OPPOSITION TO IT AB SIX SIX SIX FOUR FOUR WALDRON.

AND WE SHOW NO ONE IN THE QUEUE AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU WILL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS. REBEKAH POWER QUE HANNAH THANK YOU MISS WALDRON FOR RINGING THIS BELL AND OBVIOUSLY THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT WORK AND ENSURING THAT WE WERE DOING THE WORK WE'VE TALKED SO MUCH ABOUT TODAY OF INSURING PEOPLE THAT RECEIPT OF IT AND ACTUALLY RECOVER I JUST HAVE A CLARIFYING QUESTION WHICH IS. A LITTLE CONFUSED JUST- SAYS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO RETAIN INSTITUTIONAL- TREATMENT IN ORDER TO GET THE CREDIT OR IF IT ACTUALLY MAKES INSTITUTIONAL TREATMENT NOT ELIGIBLE FOR CREDIT. CAN WE- YEAH I KNOW THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION- THE REASON THAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND CDCR AND I GOT TOGETHER. WAS BECAUSE TO CLARIFY EXACTLY THAT- IN FACT WHEN PEOPLE ARE INSIDE. THEY CAN PARTICIPATE AND SHOULD HOPEFULLY AND MATT TREATMENT PROGRAMS. BUT THEY DO THEN QUALIFY FOR EARLY RELEASE PROGRAMS. BUT THEY CAN IT CONTINUE ONCE THEY'RE RELEASED WITH DISSIPATE OUTSIDE. AS WELL AS PEOPLE WHO DID NOT- DO TREATMENT WITHIN THIS INSIDE AND THEN WE TALK ABOUT PAROLE. SO IT DOESN'T AFFECT THE CREDITS THAT THEY WOULD GET IF THEY PARTICIPATE INSIDE BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. WHEN FOLKS ARE INSIDE THEY'RE ACTUALLY GETTING BENEFITS THAT WILL ENABLE THEM TO RE ENTRY SUCCESSFULLY AND WHAT WE FOUND OUT THAT WILL IS- WITHIN THE FIRST WEEK. OF EXITING PRISON. THERE'S UP TO AN EIGHT TIME A CHANCE OF OVERDOSE DEATHS FROM SO THE GOAL OF THIS IS TO PREVENT THAT IF THE PEOPLE OF SERVE THEIR TIME IN A WORKING TO GET BACK INTO SOCIETY. THAT WE HELP IN THAT REENTRY. AND YOU KNOW THE ORIGINAL BILL THIRTEEN OH FOR WHAT WE FOUND IN KENTUCKY FOR EXAMPLE FOR EVERY DOLLAR- THAT WAS INVESTED WE SAVE FOUR DOLLARS. BACK ON THE COST OF PUBLIC SAFETY ACOSTA. JUST RECIDIVISM COSTS JUST A WHOLE NUMBER OF. THINGS SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. THANK YOU- ANY OTHER MEMBERS QUESTIONS. SEEN NONE I THANK YOU MISTER.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- IT'S CERTAINLY- ENJOY THE DISCUSSION THIS AFTERNOON REALLY INFORMATIVE I AM HERE TO PRESENT EIGHT ELEVEN THE BILL REALLY INTENDED TO PREVENT UNREGISTERED UNTRACEABLE FIREARMS. OTHERWISE KNOWN AS GHOST GUNS THESE PRECURSOR KIT MARKETS WHICH HAVE BEEN USED TO COMMIT HORRIBLE CRIMES HERE IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING HOMICIDES MASS SHOOTINGS AND THE MURDER OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IN JANUARY OF LAST YEAR THE L. A. DIVISION OF THE BUREAU OF ALCOHOL TOBACCO FIREARMS AND EXPLOSIVES REPORTED THAT OVER GHOST GUNS IN THAT RATIO IS GROWING. UNDER EXISTING LAW AN INDIVIDUAL MAY PURCHASE THESE KIDS WITHOUT A BACKGROUND CHECK FOR CASH AND WITHOUT RECEIPT AT BEGUN SO PRIOR TO THE SOMETHING THE KID AN INDIVIDUAL IS SUPPOSED TO REGISTER THEM WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WOULD THEN CONDUCT A PRECURSORY BACKGROUND CHECK CAN PROVIDE THE SERIAL NUMBER TO THE FIREARM BUT SOMETIMES THEY ARE NOT REGISTERED IN THE GHOST KIND WHAT HAD NO SERIAL NUMBER IT'S UNTRACEABLE BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. AS IT STANDS THIS POSES A RISK TO GUN TRAFFICKING TO BUILD- UNSER REALIZE THERE ARM SOME OF THEM WHICH CAN EASILY BE DIVERTED INTO CRIMINAL ACTIVITY SO THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO BE ABLE TO PREVENT THE FURTHER PROLIFERATION OF THESE WEAPONS WAITING WOULD MEAN TENS OF THOUSANDS OF MORE OF THESE UNTRACEABLE AND UNREGULATED FIREARMS FLOWING INTO OUR COMMUNITY IT IS GOING TO PROHIBIT THE SALE A FIRE OF UNFINISHED FRAMES RECEIVERS AND KIDS TO BUILD THESE GHOST GUNS AT GUN SHOWS IN CALIFORNIA.

THE EASE WITH WHICH BEST GUNS CAN BE PURCHASED AT GUN SHOWS WITHOUT A BACKGROUND FOR PAPER WORK UNDERMINES CALIFORNIA'S LONG HISTORY OF LIFESAVING FIREARM REGULATION. FRANKLY IT'S ABSURD THAT SUCH RECKLESS BEHAVIOUR IS CURRENTLY ALLOWED. NOT FAR FROM MY COMMUNITY IN THE SUBURBS OF LOS ANGELES A TEENAGER USED TO GO SON TO MURDER TWO CLASSMATES AND INJURING THREE OTHERS THREE OTHERS ON THE CAMPUS OF SAUGUS HIGH SCHOOL. AS A RESULT PARENTS WILL NEVER HAD THEIR CHILDREN AGAIN. CHILDREN AT THE SCHOOL WILL LIVE WITH THE TRAUMA OF WITNESSING THE HORRIFYING ATTACK. AND THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN SCARRED FOREVER. I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO RECEIVE ONE OF THOSE PHONE CALLS ABOUT A CHILD IN THE PATH OF THE BULLET. MY CHILD SURVIVED BUT I ALSO KNOW ABOUT THE LIFELONG IMPACT ON FRIENDS FAMILY AND THE COMMUNITY OF THE CYNICAL AND EMOTIONAL TRAUMA THAT GOES WITH GUN VIOLENCE. A PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE DEMANDS THAT WE STRIVE TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE WE CAN DO THAT BY MAKING IT HARDER FOR DANGEROUS PEOPLE TO ACQUIRE FIREARMS RATHER THAN MAKING IT EASIER BY ALLOWING READILY ASSEMBLE PARTS TO BE PURCHASED WHILE SKIRTING REGULATION. HOW CAN THERE BE ANY JUSTIFICATION FOR ENABLING SUCH IRRESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOUR. PRESERVING A LIFE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANY RATIONALE THAT COULD BE OFFERED. STRONG GUN LAWS SAVE LIVES IN CALIFORNIA HAS STEADFASTLY PURSUED A PUBLIC HEALTH PREVENTION APPROACH TO REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE AND IT WORK. ACCORDING TO GIFFORDS ANNUAL SCORECARD CALIFORNIA HAS THE STRONGEST GUN LAWS IN THE NATION AND HAS ONE OF THE LOWEST GUN DEATH RATES IN THE COUNTRY. IF THE REST OF THE NATION HAD GUN LAWS AS STRONG AS CALIFORNIA'S ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND LIVES WOULD BE SAVED EVERY YEAR. ANGEL THAT OUR LAWS TO BE UPDATED TO REFLECT CURRENT REALITIES AND TO CLOSE DANGEROUS LOOPHOLES THEREBY MAINTAINING DECORATE DECADES OF HARD WORK BY THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE.

OF THE GROUP WOULD BE CANNOT BE HAPPENING CALIFORNIA RIFLE AND PISTOL ASSOCIATION THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION SAN DIEGO WILDLIFE FEDERATION I'M HERE TO VOICE OUR STRONG OPPOSITION PERSONALLY BILL THREE ELEVEN ELEVEN IS YET ANOTHER STEP IN THE VERY MISGUIDED LEGISLATION DRESS OF THIS FARM PARTS INSTEAD OF VIOLENT CRIMINALS KNOWINGLY. USE FIREARMS IN THE COMMISSION OF CRIMES. ASSEMBLY EIGHT UP TO ASSIGN INTO LAW TWENTY NINETEEN BY GOVERNOR SOME. WHICH DOES NOT AFFECT THE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IT'S A REQUIRED PART PRECURSOR PARTS BE TREATED IN THE SAME MANNER AS IF THEY ARE ACTUAL FARMS I MEAN TO BE SOLD ONLY THROUGH A DEALER. AND WITH A MANDATORY BACKGROUND CHECKS. AB EIGHT SEVEN NINE SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES PARTS CAN BE USED TO REPAIR EXISTING FARM OR USED TO ASSEMBLE ONE. PARTS INCLUDED OR NOT I MEAN IT CHOOSE SUCH ITEMS AS UNFINISHED RECEIVERS AND PATIENT HANDGUN FRAMES. IN ANOTHER CELLS PLEASE PARTY CONSISTS TO TEST BOX BERMAN THEIR PORTION NOT BE TREATED AS SUCH. THE MANDATED. TRACKING REQUIREMENTS AB SEVENTY NINE OPENS THE DOOR FOR GOVERNMENT CROSS REFERENCING THE PARTS PURCHASED FOR VARIOUS FARMS THAT MIGHT ALREADY BE REGISTERED IN AN INDIVIDUAL'S NAME. THIS ALONE IS PROBLEMATIC AND COULDN'T ON WOULD ONLY MAKE A LEGITIMATE AND LAWFUL GUN ON RANDOM CRIMINAL. AB THREE ELEVEN DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE NORMANDY AND OUR INTENTION COUNCIL WHICH WOULD BE TO RECORD. CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. CURRENTLY HAS REACHED. TO INCLUDE TRACKING ALL FOR THE REGISTRATION OF ALL PER BY. CHECKS WE PERIODS SIMILAR PROCEDURES FOR A- PURCHASES AND PUT. ALREADY WENT EIGHT SEVEN NINE DIFFERENT BUT THAT IMPLEMENTED THE DEAL WILL BE TASKED WITH RECORD EACH NUMBER OF TRANSITION TRANSACTIONS ON FARMS SINCE OUR LITERALLY MADE UP OF DOZENS OF PARTS. NOW ADD TO THAT LIST OF RESPONSIBILITIES PATROLLING GUN SHOWS ALL OUT ALL OVER CALIFORNIA FOR PARTS THAT ARE NOT EVEN CLEARLY DEFINE. ALL ALL THIS WHILE THE LIST OF OVER TEN THOUSAND KNOWN AREN'T BRITISH ALLEN CONTINUES TO GROW IN CALIFORNIA. ABOUT THE AUTHORS INTEND FOR THIS LEGISLATION AS MENTIONED IN JULY OF TWENTY SIXTEEN GOVERNOR BROWN ALREADY SIGNED ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN PIMCO'S GUN. WHICH REQUIRES THE STERILIZATION. AB FIFTY SEVEN ALREADY MAKES IT ILLEGAL TO TERM FIREARM PRECURSOR PARGETER FARM WITHOUT PROPER REGISTRATION STERILIZATION FROM D. O. J. AND THE COMPLETION OF A BACKGROUND CHECK. SO WHAT IS THE TRUE INTENT IN THE SESAME OF AB THREE ELEVEN. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE AUTHOR SHOULD WE ARE SEEKING TO MAKE A SELL THESE PARTS UNLAWFUL AND AFTER OFFICERS IN UNIFORM TO ENFORCE IT. WE WERE VERY MUCH APPRECIATED ASSEMBLY MEMBER IT IS CLOSE COULD PLEASE PROVIDE US WITH A FIREARM PRECURSOR PARTS DEFINITION WE BASS FOR THIS MANY TIMES. IT IS YET TO BE RECEIVED FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. THE ALIFORNIA RIFLE AND PISTOL ASSOCIATION WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT COMMONSENSE GUN LAWS FOCUSED ON VIOLENT CRIMINALS WHO CHOOSE USE FARMS TO BREAK THE LAW HOWEVER AB THREE ELEVEN WILL NOT DO THAT SHE'S ONLY. COMPLICATES THE AVAILABILITY OF SHORT RUN UNTIL TEN PARTS NEEDED TO REPAIR AND UPGRADE. LAWFULLY OBTAINED FARMS. YOU CAN IS A VERY. OF OREGON THEIR IT HAS BEEN OUR COSTA GOAL TO TOWARD COMMON SOLUTIONS YOUR THE ISSUE OF CRIME AND FARM. IS CAN DONE HOW WITH SACRIFICE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. AND ABILITY OF LAW ABIDING CITIZENS PROTECT THEIR FAMILIES TO HAUNT ENJOY COMPETITIVE SHOOTING EVENTS. AND CERTAINLY CAN BE DONE WITHOUT BANNING THE LAWFUL OF THE LAWFUL ACTIONS OF CALIFORNIANS TO PARKS THEY NEED TO REPAIR THE EQUIPMENT THEY CHOOSE TO BUY AND ENJOY. POLICE FOREGOING REASONS A CALIFORNIA RIFLE AND PISTOL ASSOCIATION AND OTHER STAND IN STRONG OPPOSITION AB THREE ELEVEN AND STRONGLY URGE YOUR NO VOTE FOR THIS MISGUIDED LEGISLATION. THANK YOU FOR THE TIME. THANK YOU MISTER. MISTER CHAIRMAN. JIM HE WAS CREDITS. GUNNERS CAL. I'M SORRY I THINK YOU ONLY LEFT YOU ONE MINUTE BUT GO HEAD. STOCKTON FAMILY BE FAXED OKAY I'M REPRESENTING GOVERNORS CALIFORNIA AND THE NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION I NEED TO POINT OUT A COUPLE OF THINGS- AFTER SPEAKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES INCLUDING THOSE A TWO FOUR AND SIX THERE'S THEY'RE STARTING TO TELL ME THAT EVERY TIME THAT A CRIMINAL. HE RACES A SERVER NUMBER OFF A GUN AND MARTINES THEY'RE CALLING THAT A GHOST GUN SO THE PROLIFERATION HIS IS A MESS. CALIFORNIA'S GUN SHOWS IN HAVE BEEN TOUTED BY EVEN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AS SOME OF THE MOST CRIME FREE GUN SHOWS IN THE COUNTRY THEY COMPLY WITH ALL LAWS FOR DEALERS OF AMMUNITION OF- UP MY ARMS AND NOW PRECURSOR PARTS IS. WE WOULD KNOW WHAT THAT WAS IF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DID THE JOB THAT THE LEGISLATURE TOLD THEM TO DO AND GAVE US A PICTORIAL- INDICATION OF WHAT THESE WHAT QUALIFIED AS A- PRECURSOR PART AND WHAT DID NOT. THAT WE ARE SENATE LEAVE WITHOUT. THAT BUT- THERE THERE WERE IS EVIDENCE A GUN SHOWS UP- PRECURSOR PARCEL THE GUN SHOWS LEAD TO PROLIFERATION OF CRIMINALLY USE THOSE GUNS THERE IS NO CONNECTION. UNFORTUNATELY WHAT APPEARS TO BE AN ATTEMPT TO NEEDLESSLY CRIPPLED GUN SHOWS HAVE BEEN OPERATING IN THE STATE. FRANKLY WITHOUT INCIDENT FOR MANY YEARS REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOUR TO THE TESTIMONY YOU IT HURTS THE TRUTH IS THEY ARE SOME OF THE MOST LAW ABIDING UNDER CURRENT LAW ALL. SHOWS UP PRECOCIAL PARTS MUST BE PROCESSED THROUGH A LICENSED DEALER AND REQUIRE A BACKGROUND CHECK WITH THE PARTS ARE SOLD ON A BRICK AND MORTAR. STORE OR AT A AT A GUN SHOW THE TERM GUN SHOW LOOPHOLE THIS IS SIGNIFICANT MISNOMER GIVEN THAT EVERY GUN SHOW MUST COMPLY WITH EVERY STATUTE. BACKGROUND CHECKS WAITING PERIODS AND REGISTRATION AND REGARDLESS OF WHAT WHAT YOU HEAR IN TESTIMONY HERE WE KNOW FOR A FACT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. REGULARLY SENDS AGENTS INTO GUN SHOWS TO INVESTIGATE THE SALES AND ACTIVITIES ARE GOING ON AND THEY STILL RARELY COME BACK. WITH THE- INDICATION OF CRIMES BEEN COMMITTED. ANY ADOLESCENT DEALER WHO BREAKS THE LAW. SHOULD BE CHARGED WITH BREAKING THE LAW. IN FACT ACCORDING TO NOT OF THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE REPORT. ON THE SOURCE AND USE OF FIREARMS INVOLVED. IN CRIME. NOW SHE JUST ONLY ONE POINT THREE. PERCENT OBTAINED A GUN FROM A RETAIL SOURCE INCLUDING REGISTERED- PRECURSOR PART DEALERS AND EVEN FEWER FROM GUN SHOWS THE EVIDENCE IS VERY CLEAR THE COUNCIL'S THEMSELVES AND THE LAW ABIDING ATTENDEES ARE NOT THE PROBLEM- MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. HERE IN AMERICA WE'VE BEEN MAKING SO CALLED GHOST GUNS SINCE THE FORMATION OF THE COUNTRY IN ALL FIFTY STATES MAKING THE GUN AT HOME HAS BEEN ALLOWED BY EVERY STATE AND EVERY HAND THAT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. ALL WE'RE DOING IS CONTINUING TO DO THAT IT IS LEGAL TO DO SO AS LONG AS YOU DO OT SELL THAT THAT OR TRANSFER THAT BYRON HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE ADD THE REQUIREMENT THAT A SERIAL NUMBER BE ADDED TO THAT TO BE LEGAL WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT THESE LAWS ARE ONLY AFFECTED LAW ABIDING CITIZENS THEY ARE NOT. AFFECTING THE CRIMINALS IN ANY WAY. AND WHEN YOU WHEN SOMEBODY POINTS OUT THAT WE CAN PREVENT TWELVE THOUSAND DEATHS IN THE STATE GOVERNMENT THAT IS GOOD HOLDEN NUMBER.

WE'LL NEXT GO TO LINE FOR EIGHTEEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. ONE FOUR EIGHTEEN I'M CALLING ON BEHALF OF MY HUSBAND TO DANIEL MCKINNON AND MYSELF. WHO VERY RECENTLY BECAME A LEGAL GUN OWNERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE ARE LIFELONG GUN CONTROL DEMOCRATS AND WE ARE STRONGLY OPPOSED TO THIS LEGISLATION AND WE ARE STRONGLY OPPOSED TO THE ONGOING ATTACK ON OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS WHICH I LIKE MANY OTHERS ARE COMING TO UNDERSTAND AND LAWFULLY EXERCISED IN THE WAKE OF WHAT THIS CORRUPT THE LEGISLATURE IS DOING. IT'S AND AT THIS TIME THERE'S NO ONE ELSE IN THE QUEUE. THANK YOU WITHOUT NOW BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE- WE'LL START WITH MISS WICKS WHO HAD A NAME AND A PERSON MISTER SARATOGA THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I THINK YOU AS A MEMBER WARD FOR BRINGING THE BILL IN YOUR LADERSHIP ON THIS I'M EXCITED TO HAVE YOU AS A COLLEAGUE HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE- YOUR FRESHMAN TERM AND I WOULD LOVE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR. THINKING THIS WORKS. THE SEATTLE HI- ASSEMBLY MEMBER WARD- THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONCERN ON THIS ISSUE NUMBER ONE- WHERE DO LAW ABIDING CITIZENS PURCHASE PRECURSOR PARTS WHICH ARE PARTS FOR BROKEN GUNS ARE HARDER TO MAKE ONE YOURSELF. CURRENTLY THAT HAS. DID THAT WILL PREVENT THE- MAKING OF A GHOST GUN. IS THAT WHERE THEY PURCHASED THEM RIGHT CURRENTLY THEY'RE ACTUALLY ABLE TO BE PURCHASED AT BRICK AND MORTAR STORES ONLINE AND- AT THESE GUN SHOWS SO- WE KNOW THAT THE IMPORTANT WORK THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIBSON'S BILA DONE THROUGH EIGHTY EIGHT SEVENTY NINE IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO- CURTAIL SOME OF THE ONLINE AND REGULATED ACTIVITY THIS BILL AB THREE ELEVEN SEEKS TO FURTHER NARROW THAT AND WORK ON THE ISSUE AT GUN SHOWS WITH SISTER A LITTLE BIT MORE PERMEABLE- IN THEIR TRANSACTIONS. SO IT STILL RETAINS A LAWFUL AN ELIGIBLE GUN OWNERS RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO PURCHASE A PRECURSOR KID PART AT A BRICK AND MORTAR STORE IN CALIFORNIA. SO THAT WOULD BE A RETAILER THAT CAN SELL IT AND THEN OTHER RETAILERS THAT GO TO GUN SHOWS THAT ARE OUT OFTENTIMES. BRICK AND MORTAR OWNERS. THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT AND SHOW I'M SORRY AND I'M THERE. YES SO THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT THE POINT OF SALE AND THE NATURE OF THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THAT SALE TAKES PLACE THAT THERE ARE BETTER CONTROLS WE ALSO KNOW FROM THE- DEPARTMENT JUSTICE THAT THEY ARE NOT THEY'VE TOLD US THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO ENFORCE MANY OF THE REGULATIONS AT GUN SHOWS. SO IN THE EFFORT TO BE ABLE TO FURTHER CURTAIL GUN VIOLENCE AND PROVIDE PROTECTIONS FOR OUR COMMUNITIES I THINK THIS BILL SEEKS TO BE ABLE TO TRAIN THOSE TOWARDS BRICK AND MORTAR STORES ONLY. MY CONCERN IS FOR LAW ABIDING CITIZENS. WHO NEED GUN PARTS. TO REPAIR THEIR GUNS AND PROTECT THEMSELVES. I HEAR THAT WHILE IN THE MEANWHILE WE HAVE NON LIFE BY LAW AIDING CITIZENS. WHO VICTIMIZE EVERYONE ELSE. AND I'VE SEEN A LOT OF THOSE- I'VE HAD POLICE OFFICER FRIENDS KILLED BY THEM- THEY ARE GHOST GUNS BUT THEY'RE NOT JUST GHOST GUNS MADE BY PEOPLE. THEIR GHOST GUNS WHO WITH SERIAL NUMBER SHAVED OFF- BAD GUYS ARE GONNA GET THEIR GUNS. BECAUSE THEY DON'T JUST COME FROM CALIFORNIA ARE GUN SHOWS THEY COME FROM ACROSS. IN OTHER COUNTRIES- IT I KNOW I JUST DON'T SEE HOW THIS IS GOING TO HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON THE SO I'M NOT GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THE BILL. ANYONE ELSE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. WHICH WAS PARKED QUE HANNAH I WANT TO JOIN NETWORKS AND THANKING YOU FOR THIS EFFORT IN EXPANDING ON MR GIVES IMPORTANT WORK IN THIS SPACE AND ASK TO JOIN YOUR CALL THANK. YOU CAN EXPECT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST HER AYE VOTE THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU IN THE INTEREST OF TIME JURORS RECOMMEND I VOTE. AND YOU MAY CALL THE ROLL ON AB THREE ELEVEN THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER HI JONES SAWYER AYE LACKEY. LACKEY NO BARRICADE HIM BACK HE HAD AYE CORK. QUICK NOT VOTING SANTIAGO. SEE OUR TOE NO SEE OUR TURN NOW WICKS HI WICKS I LI LI I. MEASURES ARE CALLED NEED TO ONE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU. THERE WERE TWO OR LAST TWO. YEAH NUMBER ELEVEN AB TWO EIGHT TWO LACKEY MISDEMEANOR DIVERSION AND NUMBER TWELVE AB SIX SIX NINE LACKEY FIREARMS AND SAPE AND GUNS. ROOF SAVE THE BEST FOR LAST. ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. WE'VE BEEN HERE AWHILE. DIGITAL I'LL TRY TO BE SO SICK TO DIRECT BUT- WHAT THESE BILLS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO ME SO I DON'T WANT TO SHORT CHANGE THEM. FIRST OF ALL LET ME THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT. THIS FIRST BILL- TWO EIGHTY TWO. I DON'T WANT TO START BY SAYING I WILL ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE'S MEMBERS TO NARROW THE BILL. DO YOU AYE OFFENSES. DIVERSION IS ACTUALLY AN ALTERNATIVE. TO CRIMINAL CONVICTION. FOR OFFENDERS. I'D JUST REAL QUICKLY I WANT YOU TO HEAR WHAT THE GOVERNOR SAID WHEN HE APPROVED AND SIGNED THE DIVERSION BILL BY A MOSTLY MEMBER TEAM. THAT WAS THIRTY TWO THIRTY FOUR IF YOU CARE. AND THIS IS WHAT THE WHAT HE SAID. HE HIT I'M NOT GONNA READ THE WHOLE THING BECAUSE HE BASICALLY SUPPORTS THE BILL MANY SAID HOWEVER I'M CONCERNED THAT THE CRIME OF DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE WAS NOT EXCLUDED FROM THE MISDEMEANOR DIVERSION PROGRAM. I WILL SEEK TO EXPEDITIOUSLY REMEDY THIS ISSUE. WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN THE NEXT LEGISLATIVE SESSION AND I WAS PROBABLY. ANXIOUS TO ANSWER THAT CALL MUCH OF THIS BILL IS- THIS PARTICULAR BILL WOULD HAVE EXCLUDED OTHER CRIMES HEY CRIMES CHILD ABUSE ELDER ABUSE ALSO FROM DIVERSION. HOWEVER NOW IT NO LONGER DOES THAT IT'S SPECIFICALLY TO OUR DELIGHT OFFENSES. LET ME TELL YOU WHY I'M SO COMMITTED TO THIS BILL EVERYBODY. THERE'S NOTHING THERE'S NO OTHER CRIME BUT I'M MORE FAMILIAR WITH I SPENT TWENTY OF MY TWENTY EIGHT YEARS WORKING GRAVEYARD SHIFT. IN THE FOCUS OF THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL DURING THOSE HOURS IS TO REMOVE IMPAIRED DRIVERS FROM THE ROADWAY BEFORE THEY CAUSE CALAMITY. I WAS SUCCESSFUL IN STOPPING SOME AND I WAS UNFORTUNATELY THE RESPOND- TO MULTIPLE TRAGEDIES. I'M A NON DRINKER I'VE NEVER DRANK AN ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE BY CHOICE. SO WHEN I FIRST CAME ON THE HIGHWAY PATROL I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THIS IMPAIRMENT THANK. WHEN I FIRST WAS SHOWED WHAT WAS AN IMPAIRED INDIVIDUAL THAT THEY WERE SUBJECT TO ARREST THAT THAT HELP UNFAIR. THIS PERSON DOESN'T LOOK DRUNK. AND THAT'S BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE DRUNK. TO ACTUALLY BE THE IMPETUS TO SERIOUS TRAGEDY I LEARNED THAT AND I LEARNED IT BY GROUP RESPONDING TO CASE AFTER CASE AFTER CASE WITH THE SAME LEVELS OF. BLOOD ALCOHOL CONCENTRATION. I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW EVERYBODY I'M I'M NOT. HERE PORTION THIS BILL BECAUSE I WANT PUNISHMENT. I WANT PREVENTION AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE A CONVICTION FOR DO YOU WHY. IT'S MUCH HARDER TO GET THAT IT'S MUCH HARDER TO ARRIVE. AT THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WILL. KEEP THE OFFENDER FROM REPEATING. AND THAT HELPS US IDENTIFY THOSE WHO ARE REPEATING OVER AND OVER SO THAT WE CAN TRY TO GET THE INTERVENTION. AND I JUST HOPE THAT YOU'LL UNDERSTAND. THE POWER OF THIS BILL IF IT'S NOT SUCCESSFUL. I PROMISE YOU I DON'T HAVE STUDIES OTHER THAN MY OWN LIFE EXPERIENCE TO TELL YOU THE PEOPLE WILL DIE. NEEDLESSLY IF WE DON'T PASS THIS MEASURE. AND I HAVE A SOMEONE A WITNESS I HAD TO BUT- WE'RE ONLY GONNA HAVE ONE. AND THAT'S GOING TO BE NEAR THE SOLANO. BUSTLE MEN AND SHE'S WITH CRIME VICTIMS UNITED HOPEFULLY SHE'S ON THE LINE. I AM CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN GREAT YOU MAY BEGIN THANK. FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU ON A WHEELCHAIR- JONES SAWYER AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR ALLOWING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. CRAPPIE COMMISSION EITHER WANT TO FIRST THANK THE AUTHOR FOR RECOGNIZING. POURTANT MESSED UP PORTENT AT THIS BILL AND THAT EFFECT ON PUBLIC SAFETY AND ON CRIME VICTIMS. DO YOU LIVE OUR CRIMES THAT PERMEATE OUR SOCIETY AND CREATE. VICTIMS AS WELL AS- THE ALCOHOLISM THAT PLAGUED PEOPLE WITHIN OUR SOCIETY. UNITED SUPPORT MEANINGFUL CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM UNFORTUNATELY AB THREE TWO THREE FOUR WAS NOT THAT WHEN IT COLLECTED TO INCLUDE DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE AS A PARENT THAT SHOULD NOT BE DEFERRED IT. WHAT THAT DOES IS ACTUALLY PUT PUBLIC THE PUBLIC SAFETY OF CALIFORNIA AT RISK AND IT CREATES MORE VICTIMS. JUST ON ONE DAY ALONE WHICH WOULD LEAVE YOUR THE OF THIS YEAR CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCED THIRTY DEATH THAT'S NOT JUST THE U. I. ARREST THE THIRTY DEATHS DUE TO DRUG DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE. THAT TO ME IS JUST STAGGERING WHEN YOU THINK OF THAT AND JUST ONE DAY OUT OF THE YEAR- ANYTIME THAT MULTIPLY THAT THROUGH THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR WE ARE FACING OUR CORTES PEOPLE GREAT BODILY IT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INJURED. I LISTENED EARLIER TO THE FAMILIES ACROSS MY HEART OF THE G. LIKE DRIVERS WHO TOOK OFF AND LEFT PEOPLE TO DIE THAT HAPPENS. EVERY DAY IN OUR STREETS- IT IS AN- THAT WE KEEP THIS AS A PARABLE OFFENSE I WOULD JOIN WITH THE HONORABLE ASSEMBLY MEMBER JACQUI AND SAY THIS IS NOT ABOUT PUNISHMENT. IT REALITY THIS IS ABOUT PREVENTION AND I CAN SPEAK TO THAT PERSONALLY. I HAD AN INDIVIDUAL WHO I WAS MARRIED TO WHO HAD AN ALCOHOL IS AN ISSUE. AND HE DROVE DRUNK IN WHOLE WALL. LUCKILY NOBODY WAS HURT BUT I WAS THE ONE THAT MADE THE CALL TO HAVE HIM ARRESTED. AND ABOUT THAT ARREST THOUGH IT WAS-HIS SECOND EAGLE AYE HE FINALLY THE LIGHT WENT ON. AND HE STARTED PROGRAMMING HE WENT THROUGH REHABILITATION HE'S IN A ON A CONSISTENT BASIS. I TRULY BELIEVE THAT WOULD BECAUSE NOT BECAUSE I MADE THAT CALL BUT BECAUSE OF IT BEING A SECOND DO YOU WHY AND THE REQUIREMENTS ON THAT OF ATTENDING CERTAIN THINGS. THAT IT REALLY DID CHANGE WITH INDIVIDUAL APPLY. THERE WAS ANOTHER SPEAKER THAT WAS GOING TO BE HERE THIS EVENING- UNFORTUNATELY SHE COULD NOT HANDLE IT FIVE YEARS AGO TODAY HER SON WAS KILLED BY DUI DRIVER IMPOSTER COUNTY ON HIGHWAY FORTY NINE. THERE WERE THREE BOYS WALKING TOGETHER TO THE LOST THEIR LIVES THE SURVIVING BOY IS SCARRED FOR LIFE HE WAS EIGHT THIRD TIME DUI OFFENDER. SO HAVING THESE CARPOOL DELIGHTS AND NOT DEFERRED EXAM IS CRITICAL NOT ONLY FOR PUBLIC SAFETY BUT LIKE I SHARED WITH YOU A VERY PERSONAL STORY FOR PREVENTION. SO ON BEHALF OF CRIME VICTIMS UNITED ON BEHALF OF PUBLIC SAFETY IN CALIFORNIA. I AGAIN WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR PRETTY MUCH SUPPORT I KNOW HE HAS PERSONAL EXPERIENCE LIKE I DO. AND I WOULD URGE THIS COMMITTEE TO PLEASE PLEASE PASS THIS BILL SO THAT WE CAN PROTECT INNOCENT LIVES IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU THANK YOU. DO YOU. ALBERT TO REDUCE NAME ON HERE IS THE- RESIDENTS NEXT ONE THE NEXT ONE. DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER WITNESSES. YOU DID NOT OKAY- OUR LIST WILL GO TO THE ROOM.

YOUR MEMBERS GOOD EVENING JONATHON FELDMAN THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. MADTOM OF CAROLINA ONE SIXTY NINE PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD EVENING CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS GAIL STEWARD ON BEHALF OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY SUMMER STEPHAN IN STRONG SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL TWO EIGHTY TWO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MAX SOMEONE TO LINE FOR TWENTY TWO PLEASE CALL I HAD. GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS- LARRY MORSE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF AB TWO EIGHT TWO. THANK YOU SIR. ENACT A MOTEL NINE ONE THIRTY EIGHT PLEASE GO AHEAD. SHARE MEMBERS RANGE ALONG WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO THE CREATION ALL FROM FOR. THANK YOU. THERE'S NO ONE ELSE CAN MAKE YOU. THANK YOU NOW WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION I'VE GOT THE SHORT END FROM ACLU AND PETER CALLOWAY SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE. YES GOOD GOOD EVENING KAREN AND MEMBER KATHY SURE FOR A DEAL YOU CALIFORNIA ACTION WE RESPECTFULLY NOT SUPPOSED EIGHTY TO EIGHTY TWO- I WANT TO START BY THANKING ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY FOR HIS FOCUS ON PREVENTION BUT ALSO TO SAY THAT THIS YOU KNOW IT'S A LONG WAY TO ACHIEVE THAT. MISDEMEANOR DIVERSION IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL THAT ALLOWS JUDGES TO DETERMINE BASED ON THE INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE WHETHER PUBLIC SAFETY IS BEST SERVED BY PROCEEDING WITH THE CRIMINAL PROSECUTION. OR BY CONVERTING THE CASE- FROM PROSECUTION THERE'S NO OFFENSE FOR WHICH THE VERSION IS THE ONLY OPTION I WANTED TO MAKE THAT CLEAR IT IT ALWAYS BY THE DECISION OF THE JUDGE THAT IT IS THE BEST CHOICE IN THIS CASE. IN THE VERSION THE DEFENDANT GETS THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THE CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST. AGAINST FROM. THE VENTRALLY. COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS SET BY THE JUDGE AND PARTICIPATION IN WHATEVER PROGRAM PROJECT ORDER. AGUIAR-CURRY A DIVERSION. IS GOOD RESEARCH SHOWS THAT DEFENDANTS WHOSE CASES ARE DIVERTED AND MONITORED BY THE COURT ARE FAR LESS LIKELY TO RE OFFEND PREVENTING THOSE FUTURE CRIME AND FAR MORE LIKELY TO FIND EMPLOYMENT IN FUTURE THAN THOSE WHO ARE CONVICTED- AND- AND- HAVE TERMS LIKE LOCATION OR NOT WHATEVER PENALTY MIGHT BE IMPOSED. MISDEMEANOR DUI OFFENDERS LIKE OTHER OFFENDERS SHOULD WHERE THE JUDGE FINDS IT APPROPRIATE HAVE THIS CHANCE. TO AVOID CRIMINAL CONVICTION. EXEMPTION OF D. Y. FOR MISTER DIVERSE IS NOT NECESSARY TO MAKE THIS PROGRAM CONSISTENT WITH THE EXISTING VEHICLE CODE PROVISION REGARDING THE PERSON FOR D. Y. AND- THE LEGISLATURE HAS PREVIOUSLY ACTED TO CLARIFY THAT THE PERSON PROGRAM. AVAILABLE TO MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY AND VETERANS INCLUDES MISDEMEANOR DELIGHT IS NOT WITHSTANDING SECTION TWENTY SIX THREE FORTY OF THE VEHICLE CODE AND COULD ADD TO THAT CLARIFICATION HERE AS WELL IF THE CONCERNED IN. OCTOBER THE POTENTIAL FOR CONFLICT. BETWEEN THE TWO PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL. THIS WE KNOW ALLOWING TO DETERMINE WHETHER TO VERSION IS THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION IN PARTICULAR CASE PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY BY PREVENTING RECIDIVISM IT PRESERVES PUBLIC RESOURCES AND HELP THE FOUNDERS TO MOVE ON TO A LOT. THIS IS TRUE FOR THOSE WHO ARE CHARGED WITH MISDEMEANOR D. Y. AS IT IS FOR OTHER DEFENDANTS CHARGED WITH OTHER CRIMES WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE ON EIGHTY TO EIGHTY TWO. THANK YOU MR CALLAWAY. NOW GOOD EVENING SHARE MEMBERS PETER CALLOWAY THAT THE PUBLIC DEFENDER IN SAN FRANCISCO I WORK IN THE MISDEMEANOR UNIT WHICH HANDLES THE VAST MAJORITY OF. YOU I'VE SENT THIS YEAR- ECHOING MAKE SURE IT'S A IT'S A COMMON MISCONCEPTION THAT PEOPLE PUSHING FOR REFORM EVEN IN THIS SPACE- DON'T CARE ABOUT REDUCING HARM WHEN ACTUALLY THE REVERSE IS TRUE- AND MAKE SURE NOTED. DIVERSION HELPS PREVENT CRIME CONVICTION DOES NOT FULLER IT SURE MAKES THIS VERY VERY CLEAR IN FACT THERE WAS A RECENT STUDY OUT OF BOSTON SHOWING THAT DECLINING TO PROSECUTE NONVIOLENT MISDEMEANOR CASES REDUCES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THAT PERSON WILL GO ON TO COMMIT ANY OTHER CRIME IN THE FUTURE- DIVERSION IS NOT MANDATED IN ANY CASE IT NEARLY ENABLE JUDGES TO OFFER IT IN THE RARE CASES WHEN THEY DEEM IT APPROPRIATE- AND JUDGES ACROSS THE STATE NEWS ONE THOUSAND ONE POINT NINE FIVE RARELY AND ALMOST NEVER. FOR DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE. IN CASES WHERE DOES DOES THIS JUDGE DECIDE TO OFFER DIVERSION SHE MUST FIRST CONDUCT IN ELIGIBILITY EVALUATION INCLUDES AN ASSESSMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY. BASED ON THE FACTS OF THE CASE AND THE PERSON'S CRIMINAL RECORD IF ANY THIS DECISION MUST BE. QUOTE GROUNDED IN REASON JUDGMENT AND GUIDED BY LEGAL PRINCIPLES AND POLICIES APPROPRIATE TO THE PARTICULAR MATTER AT ISSUE AND QUOTE. ANY REPORTER FEARS OF NEW STATUTES BEING USED RECKLESS CLEAR BASS PLAYER. CALIFORNIA JUDGES ARE AS CONCERNED WITH PUBLIC SAFETY IS ANYONE AND ALSO TEND TO FEAR THAT SOMEONE THEY TREATED LENIENTLY MIGHT RE OFFENSE EVEN GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE LITERATURE- WHEN A PERSON IS FOUND ELIGIBLE FOR DIVERSION. INCLUDING IN THE WHITE CASES THEY'RE TYPICALLY REQUIRED TO UNDERGO SUBSTANTIAL PROGRAMMING FAR BEYOND WHAT MIGHT BE REQUIRED OF THEM EVEN IF THEY WERE CONVICTED OF THE OFFENSE THEY'RE CHARGED WITH- GRANNY CAN LAST TO TWO. AND IF A PERSON FAILED TO COMPLETE ANY PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS RESUME. IN ONE EXAMPLE A PUBLIC DEFENDER CLIENTS CHARGED WITH DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE WAS GRANTED DIVERSION ON A NUMBER OF CONDITIONS INCLUDING THAT HE REMAINING IN HIS SOBER LIVING ENVIRONMENT FOR TWO YEARS AND CONTINUE. DALY ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS MEETINGS. A GUILTY PLEA OR CONVICTION. AFTER TRIAL. TO THE CHARGE WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN NONE OF THOSE CONDITIONS JUST THE DIY MANDATED- PROGRAM. CREDIT SCORE ANY TIME SERVED IN JAIL- AND COURT PROBATION- SO HERE REHABILITATIVE PROGRAM REMAINS IN PLACE ENHANCING PUBLIC SAFETY FAR MORE THAN THE ALTERNATIVE AND THIS IS WHY THE STUDIES THAT SUPPORT. A NO VOTE SHOW THIS TIME AND TIME AGAIN- IN ANOTHER POINT OKAY THIS IS A PART OF A YOUR AT YOUR FIVE MINUTE MARK COULD YOU WRAP IT UP. SURE I'LL I'LL JUST NOTE THAT. IN IN PASSING AB THIRTY TWO THIRTY FOUR CALIFORNIA VOTERS REPUDIATED EARLIER POLICY THAT LED TO MASS INCARCERATION INCLUDING ALL THE RACIAL DISPARITIES. THAT INTENDED DECIDING THAT MANY MISDEMEANORS INCLUDING D. WHY SHOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR DIVERSION PROGRAMS THAT ACTUALLY HELP KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE AB TWENTY TWO. IN THE RETURN TO THE FAILED POLICIES. THAT HARM CALIFORNIA FAMILIES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES CLICK DECADES AND WE URGE A NO VOTE THANK YOU FOR THE TIME. THANK YOU. NOW FOR ANY WITNESSES IN FORTY TWO OH TO. SEE IN NONE OTHER ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ON THE TELECONFERENCE LINE.

BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THIS WORKS AS A QUESTION THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER LUCKY I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD- AND I DON'T AND I DON'T DOUBT YOUR EXPERIENCE AND WHAT YOU'VE WITNESSED OVER THE COURSE OF YOUR CAREER- BUT FUNDAMENTALLY I BELIEVE IN JUDICIAL DISCRETION- I WANT TO GIVE JUDGES THE FLEXIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT. THE FULL CONTEXT OF THE TOTALITY OF THE EXPERIENCE OF WHAT HAPPENED TO ENSURE THAT THE PUNISHMENT YOU KNOW IF IT'S A CRIME SORT OF SPEAK SO AYE IN FIRST WE WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW WHY. IF YES MR BURKE FOR THE REASONS GIVEN BY THE ACLU- I ALSO WON'T BE SUPPORTING THE BILL. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO REMIND EVERYBODY THAT. THE GOVERNOR WE HAVE IS NOT NECESSARILY A- LOCK THEM UP AND THROW AWAY THE KEY. KIND OF INDIVIDUAL I THINK WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT HE- ALSO UNDERSTANDS THE UNIQUE NATURE OF THIS PARTICULAR CRIME. AND AGAIN THE MOTIVATION IS NOT PUNISHMENT BUT THERE ARE SOME TO THERE ARE SOME. CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LEAD TO DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE IS THAT NEED THE KIND OF INTERVENTION THAT ONLY CONVICTIONS WILL BRING. AND I JUST I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT ALLOWING THE WISE TO GO UNPUNISHED. WILL CONTINUE TO ENABLE IRRESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOR PUT. INNOCENT LIVES IN DANGER AND SOME OF THESE FOLKS WILL KILL AYE ASPIRIN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU- CHAIRS RECOMMENDED UNABLE CALL THE ROLL.

THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE LEGISLATURE AUTHORIZED COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENT'S OFFICERS TO PURCHASE. AND UTILIZE NON ROSTER FIREARMS LAST YEAR HOWEVER THE LEGISLATURE ADDED REQUIREMENT FOR COMPLETION OF THE POST BASIC COURSE QUOTE ON QUOTE. BEFORE ALLOWING. THESE PROBATION OFFICERS. TO PURCHASE AND USE NON ROSTER FIREARMS. THIS INVERSELY AFFECTED PROBATION OFFICERS WHO ARE NOT REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE POST BASIC COURSES A CONDITION OF THEIR HIGHER CONTINUE DEPLOYMENT. BECAUSE OF THIS LANGUAGE PROBATION OFFICERS ARE PROHIBITED FROM USING NON ROSTER FIREARMS ON DUTY BECAUSE OF THE POST BASIC COURSE REQUIREMENTS ONLY. IT WOULD ALSO FORCE PROBATION DEPARTMENTS TO PURCHASE NEW FIREARMS ANY TIME A DEPARTMENT ISSUED ROSTERED FIRE ARM FALLS OFF THE LIST AND BECOMES A NON ROSTER FIREARM. THE CLARIFICATION OF THIS BILL PROVIDES. WILL ALLOW THE CONFIRMATION DEPARTMENTS TO MAINTAIN THE USE OF FIREARMS THAT HAVE BEEN PURCHASED AND USED BY THOSE DEPARTMENTS FOR WHICH ITS PROBATION OFFICERS HAVE FULLY BEEN TRAINED. WITHOUT THIS BILL THESE DEPARTMENTS WILL REQUIRED TO PURCHASE NEW WEAPONS FOR AFFECTED OFFICERS. SB SIX SIX NINE WOULD ALSO. FUEL THREE WOULD EXEMPT SALES TO COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENT AND OFFICERS WHO HAVE COMPLETED THE FIREARMS PORTION OF THE TRAINING COURSE SET. FORTH BY POST AND THEY MUST COMPLETE A LIVE FIRE QUALIFICATION PRESCRIBED BY THEIR EMPLOYING ENTITY AT LEAST ONCE EVERY SIX MONTHS. AND WE ALSO HAVE HERE TO TESTIFY TO THIS BILL OVER TO RECALL I'M SURE HE'S- STILL HERE. THANK YOU ROOM MISTER CHAIRMAN MAC YES WHENEVER YOU'RE READY MR I HAVE NOTHING BUT PATIENT SIR. OKAY YOU UNDERSTAND IS A FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER THIS PROCESS GOOD EVENING COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY. THIS MEASUREMENT THANK FOR KAREN LEGISLATION I ALSO APPRECIATE YOUR STAFF'S EFFORTS ON THIS AS WELL AS THE COMMITTEE STAFFS. OBERNOLTE COMING UP WITH A COLLISION PROVISIONAL INNOVATIONS REPRESENTING NEARLY TEN THOUSAND RECONCILE PROBATION OFFICERS IT'S ONE OF SUPPLEMENT SOME OF TOUCH SOME OF THE COMMENTS FROM MR LACKEY. FIRST AND FOREMOST. AS A RESULT OF. THE REALIGNMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY OF THE LAST TEN YEARS. VIRTUALLY EVERYONE THAT LEAVES A STATE PRISON OR LOCAL COUNTY JAIL. IS ENTRUSTED TO THE CUSTODY OF OPERATION OFFICER TO SUPERVISE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE IT TO FACILITATE THE REENTRY. OVERWHELMINGLY MOST OF OUR OFFICERS DON'T CARRY WEAPONS SO THAT THIS IS A VERY SMALL SUBSECTION THE PROBATION OFFICER PROSTATE. WE CARE WE DID TWENTY ONE SIXTY FIVE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. DECEMBER BONTA CARRY THE BILL. IN RESPONSE TO THIS NEW POPULATION BECAUSE NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE A MORE THEY JUST POPULATION BUT WE'RE ALSO PROVISIONS ARE ALSO PART OF REGIONAL TASK FORCES THAT INVOLVE. GANG INTERVENTION DRUG INTERDICTION WITH LOCAL AGENCIES. THERE THEY REQUIRE THE THESE OFFICERS ALL TO HAVE THE TRAINING AND USE THE SAME WEAPON. WITHOUT THIS WE ARE VERY MUCH IMPEDE IN THAT IN THAT EFFORT THAT'S WHAT THAT'S THE THAT'S THE REASON WE DID THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE. TWENTY SIX NINETY NINE. WHICH WAS PASSED LAST BY MR SANTIAGO MY UNDERSTANDING FROM THE SPONSORS WELL IT WAS NOT ABOUT. THE TRAINING THE BILL WAS ABOUT EXPANDING. THE NUMBER OF OFFICERS THE CANOES NOT NOT TO FARMS AND IN PART OF THOSE NEGOTIATIONS. DID THIS THIS POST TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH PUTS PUT INTO THE BILL AT THE END OF SESSION. UNFORTUNATELY THAT POSTING REQUIREMENT IS THAT THE SAME REQUIREMENT FOR PROBATION OFFICERS AS MISTER LIKE YOU SAID. I WANT TO TURN IT OVER NOW TO MR GREG THROWS ON THE LINE WHO CAN WHO CAN SUMMARIZE THE TRAINING REQUIRED DIFFERENCES BETWEEN. BETWEEN POST AND PROBATION OFFICERS. BUT I DON'T HAVE SAYS THE LEFT WITH THE MOST LIKELY MADE. POLICE OFFICERS WILL GO TO THE- TRAINING WILL CALL TO FIND THAT IN THIS BILL. THEY WILL HAVE MORE TRAINING- ACTUALLY AS AN ONGOING BASIS. THEN THE RACQUETBALL COPSON AND- DEPUTY SHERIFFS. BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA REQUIRED TO DRAFTING OR ITS IS TWICE IT'S ACTUALLY FOUR TIMES. EVERY QUARTER THE POLICE OFFICERS WHO HAVE TO GO THROUGH. TO THE TRAINING TO USE A GUN. COPSON W. SEVERAL I DO A ONCE A YEAR SO IN FACT WE HAVE MORE TRAINING. AND LESS SO WITH WITHOUT FURTHER DO I RESPECT US FOR NO ONE AND I LIKE TO. ALLOW MR. STOBER TO TESTIFY WAS ON THE LINE THANK YOU. THIS STEWART ARE YOU READY. YET I AM SIR WHENEVER YOU'RE READY ALL RIGHT MISTER CHAIR. OKAY MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK MY NAME IS GREG STEWART ON THE LEGISLATIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE STATE COALITION INFORMATION ORGANIZATIONS AND THE PRESIDENT SEGMENT COUNTY PROBATION ASSOCIATION. HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB SIX SIX NINE. IN ADDITION ALL OF MR TRICO STATEMENTS AND LIKE TO ADDRESS ONE OF THE MAIN CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION THE OPPOSITION STATED A PROBATION OFFICER DOES NOT COMPLETE POST BASIC COURSE. CANNOT BE SAFE WITH GUNS. RESPECTFULLY THE STATEMENT IS NOT CORRECT IN THE CERTAINLY NOT BASED UPON FACTS. FOR THE POST BASIC CORE STANDARD FORMAT. THE POST BASIC COURSES COMPRISES SIX HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR HOURS OF TRAINING. BROKEN INTO FORTY THREE LEARNING DOMAINS. ONLY A SINGLE DOMAIN ONE DOMAIN WHICH IS DOMAIN THIRTY FIVE COVERS FIREARMS IN CARRY AND CHEMICAL AGENTS. THIS IT TAKES UP TO SEVENTY TWO HOURS ONLY IT IS THE ONLY DOMAIN THAT PROVIDES FIREARMS TRAINING. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT SEVENTY TWO HOURS PROVIDING DOMAIN THIRTY FIVE INCLUDES A FIREARMS PORTION OF EIGHT THIRTY TO TRAINING. TO INFORMATION OFFICERS ALREADY MANDATED TO COMPLETE. ALSO AS MR TRICKLE MENTIONED UNDER PC EIGHT THIRTY POINT FIVE PROBATION OFFICERS ARE REQUIRED TO QUALIFY QUARTERLY WITH A FIREARM WHICH IS TWICE THE AMOUNT OF OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT. ACTIVE PROBATION OFFICERS RECEIVE MORE FIREARMS TRAINING AND OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ENFORCING PROBATION OFFICERS TO COMPLETE FIVE HUNDRED NINETY TWO HOURS OF COMPLETELY UNRELATED POST BASIC COURSE TRAINING. HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH FIRE AND SAFETY. SACRAMENTO COUNTY OUR OFFICERS MUST COMPLETE AN EIGHTY HOUR FIREARMS COURSE WHICH INCLUDES POST EIGHT THIRTY TWO TRAINING. BEFORE EVEN ENTER OUR FTO PROGRAM ARMED OFFICERS MUST QUALIFY QUARTERLY WITH A FIREARM AND MUST COMPLETE ADVANCED OFFICER TRAINING ANNUALLY. POLICE OFFICERS ARE QUALIFIED AND PROPERLY TRAINED AND WE'VE BEEN USING THESE FARMS FOR YEARS. FOR THESE REASONS RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR YES VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SO ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IN THE ROOM. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT ON THE TELEPHONE CONFERENCE NINE. AT&amp;T ARE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT ON THE PHONE.

MATT THIS TIME THERE'S NO ONE ELSE IN THE QUEUE. THANK YOU. IN NOW- WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION I'M LOOKING UP TO NAY REBEKAH MARCUS BRADY UNITED ON THE PHONE. YES GOOD EVENING SHARON MEMBERS TOBACCO MARKETS REPRESENTING BRADY AND BRADY CALIFORNIA CLOSE TO EIGHTY SIX SIX NINE WHICH UNNECESSARILY EXPANDS EXEMPTIONS COULD BE UNSAFE HANDGUNS ACTOR YOU HA THERE'S NO REASONABLE NEED TO ALLOW PROBATION OFFICERS TO THE FAST AND SAFE HANDGUNS WITHOUT COMPLETION OF THE ENTIRE CUTS BASIC COURSE. THE POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS ARE HARMFUL FIRST BROUGHT UP BY THE SPONSORS THIS BILL IS NOT A CLEAN OUT MEASURE THE CHANGES MADE LAST YEAR WERE INTENTIONAL AB SIX SIX NINE AND THAT'S IMPORTANT SAFEGUARDS WE ASK A FAMILY MEMBER SANTIAGO TO INCLUDE IN HIS AB TWENTY SIX NINETY NINE. ADDITIONALLY THE PROVISIONS ADDED BY AB TWO SIX NINE NINE OUR PERSPECTIVE IN NATURE SO A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER WHO COMPLETED THE BASIC FIREARMS COURSE PRIOR TO JANUARY FIRST OF THIS YEAR IS NOT REQUIRED TO TAKE THE FULL POST COURSE IF THEY NEED TO REPLACE. THEIR OFFER AFTER A FIRE ON. FEDERAL LAW DOES NOT IMPOSE FACE STAND UNDER. MANUFACTURED FIREARMS TO THE CONTRARY EXAMPLE FIREARMS YOU'RE NEEDING EVEN MINIMAL STANDARDS. EFFECTIVELY CREATES A PROTECTED MARKET FOR JUNK BONDS THAT OFTEN JAM MISFIRE OR MALFUNCTION DUE TO POOR CONSTRUCTION OR DESIGN. IN THE LAST FIFTY YEARS MORE AMERICANS HAVE DIED IN UNINTENTIONAL SHOOTINGS ON AN AMERICAN WARS. IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE CALIFORNIA FILL GAPS AND FEDERAL PRODUCTS THANK YOU LAWS FINANCING THE RIGHT CHECK. THE U. H. A. REQUIRES THAT ALL NEWLY DEVELOPED HANDGUN MODELS MEET BASIC RELIABILITY AND SAFETY STANDARDS. IN ORDER TO BE PLACED ON ROSTER BY THE COUNTY OBJECT. CURRENTLY THERE ARE OVER EIGHT HUNDRED GUNS ON ROSTER AND AVAILABLE FOR SALE CALIFORNIA. THE STANDARDS MANDATED FOR A FIREARM TO BE ON A ROSTER ARE FEASIBLE AFFORDABLE AND NECESSARY. B. O. H. A. AND OTHER REGULATIONS HAVE KEPT THE STATE'S RATE OF UNINTENTIONAL FIREARM DEATHS. PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND FAR BELOW THE RATE AND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHO HAVE COMPLETED THE ENTIRE BASIC COAST COURSE. HAVE LONG BEEN AN EXACT FROM THE RESTRICTIONS IN THE U. HA HOWEVER IN RECENT YEARS THE LIST OF EXEMPT AGENCIES HAS GROWN WITHOUT ANY MANDATE FOR SUCH TRAINING. LAST YEAR AB TWO SIX NINE NINE CLOSE THIS LOOPHOLE BY EXPLICITLY MANDATING FULL POST TRAINING FOR ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER TO SPEAK TO PURCHASE OFF FASTER GOT. AB SIX SIX NINE WOULD REINSTATE THE LOOPHOLE BY CARVING OUT AN EXEMPTION FROM THE RIGHT J. BURKE COUNTY PROBATION OFFICERS. ALLOWING THEM TO COMPLETE ONLY THE FIREARMS PORTION OF COACH TRAINING. NOTABLY COUNTY PROBATION OFFICERS ARE NOT SEEKING THIS CAR ABOUT BECAUSE WE NEED TO CARRY OFF ROSTER DONE. OR OR ARE UNABLE TO COMPLETE FULL POST TRAINING AND STABBED BAY SIMPLY PREFER MODELS OF HANDGUNS THAT ARE NOT ONE OF THE HUNDREDS OF ON ROSTER MODEL PREVAIL BALL. AND ALSO PREFER NOT TO UNDERGO FULL POST TRAINING. EIGHTY SIX SIX NINE. WHAT LIKELY INTERACT MORE AND SAFE HAND GUNS AND TO THE STATE IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS COMPLETE THE ENTIRE PRO TRAINING TO FULLY UNDERSTAND. HOW TO HANDLE DANGEROUS. FIREARMS THERE BEEN MANY INSTANCES AS OF WELL TRAINED OFF THE- ON. FIRING SERVICE WEAPONS. BY ALLO MORE ON. TO HAVE ACT TO AND THEY CAN'T BECAUSE OF THE PART. NOT TO USE ON ROSTER GUNS YES MEASURE LIKELY. LEAD TO MORE. DANGEROUS WEAPON AND OF THOSE WHO SHOULD NOT HAVE THAT. CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS HAVE ALREADY BEEN FOUND GUILTY OF TRAFFICKING CONTRACTOR HAND GUNS TO CIVILIANS. EIGHTY SIX SIX NINE WALKS BACK IMPORTANT SAFEGUARDS THAT WERE PASSED LAST YEAR. FOR ALL THOSE REASONS STATED BRADY AND BRADY CALIFORNIA ASKS FOR YOUR NO VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I DO. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN THE ROOM. IN OPPOSITION ANY OTHER WITNESSES ON A TELECONFERENCE IN OPPOSITION AND ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES. AT&amp;T ON THE LINE IN OPPOSITION. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO OPPOSE OF AB SIX SIX NINE PRESS ONE THAN THEIR OWN NOW AGAIN TO OPPOSE OF. EIGHTY SIX SIX NINE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO NOW. IT LOOKS LIKE WE DO HAVE ONE IN THE QUEUE WILL GO TO LINE ONE THIRTY EIGHT PLEASE GO AHEAD. CHEN MEMBERS TRYING TO MOLD RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S LOCATION WE REPRESENT THAT PROBATION OFFICERS ARE COUNTY AND- WE ARE IN SUPPORT. OF THIS BILL- I WOULD NEVER GET THROUGH EARLIER THANK YOU. RIGHT THANK YOU. THERE IS NO ONE ELSE MCHALE OKAY BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS- I PLEASE. FOR THE REBEKAH BART K. HAS- AND I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS A QUESTION FOR YOU MISTER WALKER YOU MISTER TRIGO BUT I GUESS I'M JUST TO THE POINT OF THE OPPOSITION I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THIS THEY NEED TO CARRY THESE OFF ROSTER WEAPONS CAN ONE OF YOU EXPLAIN THAT TO ME MISTER TRICKLE FIVE YOUR BEST PERSON THAT I HAVE AN IDEA BUT I THINK YOU'LL BE ABLE. TO EXPLAIN IT BETTER. WELL LOOK. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SEVEN MEMBER- I GUESS. FIRST AND FOREMOST I WOULD SAY THIS ISN'T A QUESTION OF PREFERENCE. AND AS I MENTIONED EARLIER IN MANY INSTANCES PUBLISHED OFFICERS. ARE PART OF. REGIONAL TASK FORCES. GANGS DRUGS ETCETERA. SOMETIMES FEDERAL MARSHALS. IN ORDER TO PRESERVE THE INTEGRITY OF THAT UNIT ALL THE OFFICERS ARE REQUIRED TO CARRY THE SAME GUN SO IF THE IF THE OTHER OFFICERS TEMPERATURES MAKE FOR COPS IF THEY'RE CARRYING ON MOST FARMS THE PROBATION OFFICERS REQUIRED TO CARRY THE SAME WEAPON SO THAT'S NOT A QUESTION OF PREFERENCE THE OTHER ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED IN TERMS OF WHAT WE WANT OR NOT. THE TRAINING FOR PARADE FOR RENTAL COPS IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM PROBATION OFFICERS AND I THINK EVERYONE HERE WITH KNOWLEDGE THE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT JOBS RIGHT THERE THERE ARE OVERLAPPING DUTIES YES CERTAINLY BUT PROVISIONAL ANSWERS THEY DON'T GO THROUGH POST BUT THE BUT WE ARE WILLING TO CODIFY AND THE IN THE BILL THAT CODIFIES THE HEAD THE FIREARM PORTION OF POST WHICH MAKES SENSE BUT WHAT TIME OF DAY TO SITUATION SO THERE'S NOT A PREFERENCE BUT BY CHOICE JUST BUT THE REALITY OF THE JOB. SO YOU KNOW THE RESULT OF THIS JUST IT'S A TOUGH SITUATION I UNDERSTAND BUT YOU KNOW AT AT. I DON'T. ACCORDING TO SPONSORS. THE WAS NEVER INTENT. TO SET UP. YOU CAN HAVE KNOWN AS FARMS THOSE THAT NEVER THE INTENT OF THE BILL THAT WAS THAT WAS AN OVERSIGHT. WE'RE TRYING TO FIX THAT NOW WE CAN QUIBBLE ABOUT WELL THIS IS CLEAN UP OR NOT. IT'S A RELEVANT. BUT THE INTENT OF THE RISK OF THE SUBTITLES NOT TO REMOVE REYES OFFICERS NEVER DELIVER THE INTERN WILL TRY TO FIX THAT. THANK YOU. IF YOU. DID YOU HAVE QUESTIONS.

YOU KNOW MY CONCERN ABOUT THE BILL I APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTFULNESS AS ALWAYS MR LACKEY- I DO VOTE FOR SOME OF YOUR BILLS I PROMISE. BUT MY CONCERN ABOUT THE BILL AS A SORT OF ONGOING EXEMPTIONS TO ALLOW AGENCIES TO. TO USE GUNS FROM THE PURCHASED GUNS FROM THE UNSAFE GUN LIST- AND EVERY EXEMPTION YIELDS ANOTHER EXEMPTION WHICH SHIELDS AN EXEMPTION AND SOME THE WHAT'S THE SORT OF THE POINT OF EVEN HAVING LESS SO. WITH THAT I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S FOR THE BILL TODAY SO I WANTED TO EXPLAIN THAT. OKAY OKAY. SO FOR THIS JUST FOR HISTORY LESSON FOR MANY SINCE SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE- I'VE BEEN DOING PIECEMEAL TRYING TO GET. PROPER WEAPONS IN FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO DEAL WITH POSSIBLE FIREPOWER THAT COMES BACK AT THEM THE BABIES. AND LOT OF TIMES SUPERIOR WATER WITH A HALF AND- WE SHOULD HAVE DONE ONE BILL. TO INCORPORATE ALL OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THAT AND WE COULDN'T WE HAVE TO PIECEMEAL I'M A YOU KNOW YOU WHEN YEARS FISHING GAME NEXT YEAR IT'S A BOOK YEAH NO EXPOSITION POLICE NATURE IT'S THE SECURITY GUARDS AT DISNEYLAND IRATE YOU JUST. IT JUST GOT A WHOLE IT JUST GOT OUT OF THE FINAL US. IT JUST GOT OUT IT IT JUST KEPT GOING ON AND ON AVERAGE BUT AND I REALIZE THAT WITH THAT MANY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHO ACTUALLY HAVE. TO DEAL WITH IN SOME DEBRIS DANGEROUS SITUATIONS- AND- AND I CAN DO IT WHETHER TO USC OR EVEN MY EXPOSITION POLICE OVER AN EXHIBITION PARK. WHERE NOT ONLY WITH ELECTRIC SCUM. THEY WILL HAVE THE WORLD CUP. AND WE'VE GOT TO HAVE THE BEST TRAINED SECURITY. IN THE PARK THAT WERE MY OFFICES AND- I WISH WE COULD HAVE. BUNDLED THE BALL IN IT ONE TIME BUT WE COULDN'T AND SO I. THE REASON I'M SUPPORTING IT BECAUSE THIS IS JUST A CONTINUATION AND I UNFORTUNATELY- REACTED TO A PIECEMEAL ONE BY ONE UNTIL WE GET AS MANY. GROUPS IN AS POSSIBLE THAT THAT NEEDS.
