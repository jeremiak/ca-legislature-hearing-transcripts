POLITICAL POLARIZATION.

00:32:41.827 --> 00:32:46.031 region:rollup2

THESE EXTREMISTS ARE AND BY THE

00:34:04.209 --> 00:34:06.811 region:rollup2
FACT THAT CONFIDENCE IN OUR

THE DARK --

00:34:38.276 --> 00:34:42.347 region:rollup2
COLUMNS THERE THAT SHOWS THAT IN

00:34:40.712 --> 00:34:43.949 region:rollup2
THE RUN UP TO THE ELECTION WHEN

JUST IN THE MONTH BEFORE.

00:34:53.825 --> 00:34:58.129 region:rollup2
AND HERE ARE SOME OF THE FAKE

00:34:55.226 --> 00:34:59.431 region:rollup2
THAT BY THE WAY THIS IS NOT A

00:34:58.129 --> 00:35:01.866 region:rollup2
REAL REPUBLICAN.

00:35:01.866 --> 00:35:05.837 region:rollup2
RUSSIAN TWITTER FEED.

00:35:03.435 --> 00:35:07.339 region:rollup2
SAYING OBAMA WANTS OUR CHILDREN

CONVERTED TO ISLAM HILLARY WILL

00:35:07.339 --> 00:35:10.275 region:rollup2
CONTINUE THE MISSION.

00:35:09.674 --> 00:35:11.509 region:rollup2
HERE'S ANOTHER ONE BY THE SAME

00:35:10.275 --> 00:35:12.978 region:rollup2
--

00:35:11.509 --> 00:35:14.813 region:rollup2
RUSSIAN ENTITY TALKING ABOUT

00:35:12.978 --> 00:35:17.615 region:rollup2
UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE.

00:35:14.813 --> 00:35:19.050 region:rollup2
SO AT A TIME WHEN WE ARE AT OUR

00:35:17.615 --> 00:35:21.086 region:rollup2
MOST VULNERABLE THERE ARE

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:23.622 region:rollup2
FOREIGN ENTITIES THAT ARE TAKING

00:35:21.086 --> 00:35:24.990 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGE OF THAT VULNERABILITY.

00:35:23.622 --> 00:35:26.658 region:rollup2
HERE'S WHAT HATE CRIMES LOOK

00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:30.228 region:rollup2
LIKE US IN THE TOP TEN CITIES WE

00:35:37.936 --> 00:35:40.538 region:rollup2
TWENTY FOURTEEN I HERE'S AGAIN

00:35:38.536 --> 00:35:43.274 region:rollup2
ANOTHER REPRESENTATION THAT WE

00:35:40.538 --> 00:35:45.176 region:rollup2

00:35:43.274 --> 00:35:48.513 region:rollup2
HATE CRIMES --

00:35:45.176 --> 00:35:51.116 region:rollup2

EIGHTY ELDERLY SPEAKING TODAY --

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:02.560 region:rollup2
THEY SAW SIGNIFICANT INCREASE

00:36:01.626 --> 00:36:04.996 region:rollup2

ASSAULT WERE NOT UNTIL MOST

00:36:10.301 --> 00:36:14.172 region:rollup2
RECENTLY AND WE SAW THAT WITH

00:36:12.303 --> 00:36:16.041 region:rollup2
ANTI MUSLIM ATTACKS TO ANTI

00:36:14.172 --> 00:36:18.243 region:rollup2

OR EVEN MORE SO THEM AFTER NINE

00:36:20.412 --> 00:36:23.081 region:rollup2
ELEVEN EVEN THOUGH THE AGGREGATE

00:36:21.746 --> 00:36:25.617 region:rollup2
NUMBER.

00:36:23.081 --> 00:36:26.718 region:rollup2
DOES IS IT WAS NOT AS GREAT.

00:36:25.617 --> 00:36:28.453 region:rollup2
I HATE GROUPS IN THE UNITED

00:36:28.453 --> 00:36:30.689 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA FOR THE SECOND YEAR

00:36:29.954 --> 00:36:32.457 region:rollup2
IN A ROW --

00:36:30.689 --> 00:36:33.491 region:rollup2

ORGANIZATIONS AND LEADERSHIP

00:36:41.232 --> 00:36:46.604 region:rollup2
HAVE IMPLODED THERE IS STILL A

00:36:43.935 --> 00:36:49.407 region:rollup2
VERY BIG ELASTIC POOL OF FOLKS.

00:36:46.604 --> 00:36:51.409 region:rollup2
WHO AGREE WITH WHITE NATIONALISM

00:36:49.407 --> 00:36:53.044 region:rollup2
9% IF YOU LOOK AT THE FAR RIGHT

00:36:51.409 --> 00:36:54.479 region:rollup2
9% OF AMERICANS ACCORDING TO AN

00:36:53.044 --> 00:36:56.548 region:rollup2
ABC WASHINGTON POST?

00:36:54.479 --> 00:37:00.151 region:rollup2
POLL OF LAST YEAR SAID THAT NOT

00:36:56.548 --> 00:37:01.786 region:rollup2
SHE VIEWS ARE ACCEPTABLE.

00:37:00.151 --> 00:37:02.821 region:rollup2
AS WE'VE SEEN WE'VE HAD AN

00:37:01.786 --> 00:37:04.722 region:rollup2
INCREASE.

00:37:02.821 --> 00:37:06.991 region:rollup2
IN HATE CRIMES IN CALIFORNIA

00:37:04.722 --> 00:37:08.760 region:rollup2
CITIES AND INCREASED DENSITIES

00:37:06.991 --> 00:37:10.095 region:rollup2
TEND TO BE LARGER THAN THE

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:11.663 region:rollup2
OVERALL INCREASES.

00:37:10.095 --> 00:37:12.731 region:rollup2
I AND THAT WE FIND BOTH

00:37:11.663 --> 00:37:14.933 region:rollup2
NATIONALLY AND HERE IN

00:37:12.731 --> 00:37:17.769 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HE CRIMES IN CITIES

00:37:14.933 --> 00:37:19.771 region:rollup2
ROSE 19% ACCORDING TO OUR STUDY

00:37:17.769 --> 00:37:21.106 region:rollup2

STATE OVERALL ACCORDING TO THE

00:37:21.106 --> 00:37:25.009 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AGING.

00:37:23.508 --> 00:37:27.846 region:rollup2
AND AND THERE WE HAVE --

00:37:25.009 --> 00:37:30.081 region:rollup2
THEY'RE THEY'RE CHARGING --

00:37:27.846 --> 00:37:32.484 region:rollup2
IT AGAIN FOR A RACE CONTINUES TO

00:37:30.081 --> 00:37:35.787 region:rollup2
BE THE THE THE LARGEST A COHORT.

00:37:32.484 --> 00:37:38.056 region:rollup2
OF VICE MOTIVATIONS --

00:37:35.787 --> 00:37:39.491 region:rollup2
IN IN THE STATE BUT WE ALSO SEE

00:37:38.056 --> 00:37:40.992 region:rollup2
IT'S ORIENTATION IF YOU LOOK AT

00:37:39.491 --> 00:37:42.694 region:rollup2
THAT ABOUT HALF OF THE RACE.

00:37:40.992 --> 00:37:44.162 region:rollup2
CRIMES OF OR AGAINST AFRICAN

00:37:42.694 --> 00:37:44.963 region:rollup2
AMERICAN AND HALF OF THE

00:37:44.162 --> 00:37:47.499 region:rollup2
RELIGION CRIMES OR AGAINST

00:37:44.963 --> 00:37:49.701 region:rollup2
JEWISH PEOPLE.

00:37:47.499 --> 00:37:51.503 region:rollup2
MOST RECENTLY IN THE FIRST HALF

00:37:49.701 --> 00:37:52.771 region:rollup2
OF THE YEAR THIS IS THE LATEST

00:37:51.503 --> 00:37:55.640 region:rollup2
STUDY NOT AVAILABLE ANYWHERE

00:37:52.771 --> 00:37:57.142 region:rollup2
JUST RELEASED THIS WEEK.

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:58.710 region:rollup2
BUT SHOWING THAT HATE CRIMES IN

00:37:57.142 --> 00:37:59.844 region:rollup2
THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR IN

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:02.013 region:rollup2
MANY OF THE MAJOR CITIES ARE

00:37:59.844 --> 00:38:03.515 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DE NOW BUT REMEMBER A

00:38:02.013 --> 00:38:04.749 region:rollup2
LOT EAST COAST CITIES HAD BAD

00:38:03.515 --> 00:38:06.718 region:rollup2
WEATHER FOR CONSTRUCTIVE

00:38:04.749 --> 00:38:08.787 region:rollup2
SNOWSTORMS IN MARCH ALONE.

00:38:06.718 --> 00:38:11.322 region:rollup2
AND ALSO THERE SEEMS TO BE AN

00:38:08.787 --> 00:38:13.992 region:rollup2
INCREASE GOING ON WITH RESPECT

00:38:11.322 --> 00:38:15.727 region:rollup2
TO AS THE YEAR PROGRESSES.

00:38:13.992 --> 00:38:17.662 region:rollup2
BUT LOOKING AWAY AGAIN REMEMBER

00:38:15.727 --> 00:38:19.497 region:rollup2
WHAT I TOLD ABOUT ASSAULT.

00:38:17.662 --> 00:38:20.732 region:rollup2
HE CRIMES IN LOS ANGELES FOR THE

00:38:19.497 --> 00:38:22.167 region:rollup2
FIRST HAVE TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN

00:38:20.732 --> 00:38:24.402 region:rollup2
YOU'RE NOT SEEN AS ANYWHERE ELSE

LESS.

00:38:29.374 --> 00:38:32.777 region:rollup2
THEN ANY OF THE CITIES THAT

00:38:31.176 --> 00:38:35.013 region:rollup2
SHOULD HAVE SHOWN A DECREASE AND

00:38:32.777 --> 00:38:36.080 region:rollup2

IF YOU LOOK AT THE FAR RIGHT.

00:38:49.727 --> 00:38:54.799 region:rollup2

PROSECUTION IS MUCH LOWER THAN

00:44:57.228 --> 00:44:59.664 region:rollup2
OTHER TYPES OF FELONIES AND

00:44:58.229 --> 00:45:01.499 region:rollup2
WE'LL HAVE SOME INFORMATION

00:44:59.664 --> 00:45:03.267 region:rollup2
RELATED TO THAT. TWO OTHER KEY

00:45:01.499 --> 00:45:05.303 region:rollup2
ISSUES RELATED TO THE DATABASE

00:45:03.267 --> 00:45:06.103 region:rollup2
THE ACCURACY OF THE INFORMATION

00:45:05.303 --> 00:45:08.105 region:rollup2
THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

00:45:06.103 --> 00:45:09.774 region:rollup2
HAS IN ITS DATABASE PART OF THE

00:45:08.105 --> 00:45:11.375 region:rollup2
PROBLEM IS THE LOCALS.

00:45:09.774 --> 00:45:14.579 region:rollup2
NOT REPORTING EVERYTHING --

00:45:11.375 --> 00:45:15.813 region:rollup2
DOJ WE BELIEVE CAN AS YOU SAID

00:45:14.579 --> 00:45:18.416 region:rollup2
MISTER MERRETT TUCCI REALLY SHOW

00:45:15.813 --> 00:45:19.850 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP ARE IN THIS AREA

00:45:18.416 --> 00:45:20.685 region:rollup2
AGAIN AND MISTER PHELPS WILL

00:45:19.850 --> 00:45:22.053 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE

00:45:20.685 --> 00:45:23.287 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS WE MADE TO THE

00:45:22.053 --> 00:45:24.589 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT JUSTICE AND THE

00:45:23.287 --> 00:45:26.290 region:rollup2
ACTION THEY'VE ALREADY TAKEN.

00:45:24.589 --> 00:45:27.892 region:rollup2
A WITHIN THE IF THE FIRST SIXTY

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:29.527 region:rollup2
DAYS AFTER WE ISSUED A REPORT

00:45:27.892 --> 00:45:31.495 region:rollup2
AND THEN OUTREACH TO VULNERABLE

00:45:29.527 --> 00:45:32.730 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES AGAIN IS A STATE

00:45:31.495 --> 00:45:33.798 region:rollup2
DOING ANYTHING FROM THAT

00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:35.166 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE BUT CERTAINLY

00:45:33.798 --> 00:45:36.701 region:rollup2
FOCUSED A LOT OF EFFORTS WHEN

00:45:35.166 --> 00:45:37.735 region:rollup2
WE'RE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AT THE

00:45:36.701 --> 00:45:40.037 region:rollup2
LOCAL ENTITIES WHAT ARE YOU

00:45:37.735 --> 00:45:41.405 region:rollup2
DOING. TO PROVIDE OUTREACH TO

00:45:40.037 --> 00:45:42.240 region:rollup2
THESE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES TO

00:45:41.405 --> 00:45:43.941 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE.

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:44.575 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY GET THEM COMFORTABLE

00:45:43.941 --> 00:45:46.611 region:rollup2
IN COMING FORWARD AND REPORTING

00:45:44.575 --> 00:45:48.012 region:rollup2
--

00:45:46.611 --> 00:45:49.647 region:rollup2
AN INCIDENT THAT.

00:45:48.012 --> 00:45:51.215 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY WILL IN ALL

00:45:49.647 --> 00:45:52.850 region:rollup2
LIKELIHOOD IS A HATE CRIME SO

00:45:51.215 --> 00:45:54.552 region:rollup2
THOSE WERE THE KEY AREAS THAT WE

00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:55.786 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT I'M I'M GONNA HAND IT

00:45:54.552 --> 00:45:58.289 region:rollup2
OVER TO MS FULLERTON AND SHE CAN

00:45:55.786 --> 00:46:00.558 region:rollup2
GET INTO MORE SPECIFICS ON EACH

00:45:58.289 --> 00:46:01.759 region:rollup2
OF THE AT THE KEY AREAS.

00:46:00.558 --> 00:46:02.393 region:rollup2
GOOD MORNING THANK YOU KATHLEEN

00:46:01.759 --> 00:46:04.562 region:rollup2
FULLERTON STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE

00:46:02.393 --> 00:46:06.464 region:rollup2
--

00:46:04.562 --> 00:46:07.798 region:rollup2
SO AS A SENATOR MENTIONS WE HAD

00:46:06.464 --> 00:46:09.033 region:rollup2
SEVERAL KEY FINDINGS AND THE

00:46:07.798 --> 00:46:11.102 region:rollup2
FIRST ONE IS THAT LAW

00:46:09.033 --> 00:46:12.870 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT IS NOT PROPERLY

00:46:11.102 --> 00:46:14.305 region:rollup2
IDENTIFYING HE CRIMES.

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:15.606 region:rollup2
SO THREE OF THE FOUR LAW

00:46:14.305 --> 00:46:16.741 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT AND SEES THAT WE

00:46:15.606 --> 00:46:18.175 region:rollup2
VISITED --

00:46:16.741 --> 00:46:19.810 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE THIS ISSUE WHERE THEY

00:46:18.175 --> 00:46:22.546 region:rollup2
ARE IN FACT --

00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:23.781 region:rollup2
RECORDING A AN EVENT AT AS

00:46:22.546 --> 00:46:25.216 region:rollup2
SOMETHING OTHER THAN HE CRIME

00:46:23.781 --> 00:46:27.084 region:rollup2
THERE EITHER RECORDING AS A HEAT

00:46:25.216 --> 00:46:27.885 region:rollup2
INCIDENT WHICH IS NOT CONSIDERED

00:46:27.084 --> 00:46:29.754 region:rollup2
A CRIME.

00:46:27.885 --> 00:46:31.055 region:rollup2
OR THEY ARE RECORDING INTO SOME

00:46:29.754 --> 00:46:33.057 region:rollup2
OTHER TYPE OF CRIME.

00:46:31.055 --> 00:46:35.660 region:rollup2
SO AT LAPD WHAT WE FOUND IS

00:46:33.057 --> 00:46:38.195 region:rollup2
ABOUT 20% OF THE FIFTEEN CRIMES

00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:40.431 region:rollup2
WE REVIEWED WERE INAPPROPRIATELY

00:46:38.195 --> 00:46:43.067 region:rollup2
A CLASSIFIED AS A HEAT INCIDENT

00:46:40.431 --> 00:46:44.735 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN A HATE CRIME. 53% OF

00:46:43.067 --> 00:46:46.937 region:rollup2
THE FIFTEEN WE REVIEWED AT SAN

00:46:44.735 --> 00:46:48.439 region:rollup2
FRANCISCO STATE WERE ALSO

00:46:46.937 --> 00:46:50.007 region:rollup2
CLASSIFIED AS HEAT INCIDENTS

00:46:48.439 --> 00:46:51.242 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN HATE CRIMES.

00:46:50.007 --> 00:46:53.878 region:rollup2
AND THEN AT ORANGE COUNTY

00:46:51.242 --> 00:46:55.413 region:rollup2
SHERIFF WE FOUND --

00:46:53.878 --> 00:46:56.614 region:rollup2
ONE INSTANCE OF A CRIME THAT

00:46:55.413 --> 00:46:58.783 region:rollup2
SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AS A

00:46:56.614 --> 00:47:00.318 region:rollup2
HATE CRIME BUT AGAIN WAS NOT.

00:46:58.783 --> 00:47:02.086 region:rollup2
SO WE FOUND THAT THIS IS A A

00:47:00.318 --> 00:47:03.654 region:rollup2
PERVASIVE ISSUE OF THREE OF THE

00:47:02.086 --> 00:47:04.255 region:rollup2
FOUR ENTITIES THAT WE VISITED.

00:47:03.654 --> 00:47:07.091 region:rollup2
AND ULTIMATELY THIS RESULTS IN

00:47:04.255 --> 00:47:08.459 region:rollup2
THESE CRY BEING REPORTED TO THE

00:47:07.091 --> 00:47:10.061 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AS HATE

00:47:08.459 --> 00:47:11.495 region:rollup2
CRIMES AND THEREFORE UNDER

00:47:10.061 --> 00:47:12.930 region:rollup2
REPORTING THAT THE CRIMES THAT

00:47:11.495 --> 00:47:15.366 region:rollup2
EXISTED WITHIN THESE FLEAS THREE

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:16.167 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS.

00:47:15.366 --> 00:47:17.535 region:rollup2
AND THERE ARE THREE PRIMARY

00:47:16.167 --> 00:47:19.503 region:rollup2
CAUSES WE FOUND OF THIS AT THE

00:47:17.535 --> 00:47:21.772 region:rollup2
LOCAL LEVEL AND THE FIRST ONE IS

00:47:19.503 --> 00:47:23.274 region:rollup2
INADEQUATE TOOLS AN EXAMPLE OF

00:47:21.772 --> 00:47:24.508 region:rollup2
THIS IS A SUPPLEMENTAL HEAT

00:47:23.274 --> 00:47:26.744 region:rollup2
CREDIT REPORT.

00:47:24.508 --> 00:47:28.579 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THIS IS IS A AS A FORUM

00:47:26.744 --> 00:47:30.181 region:rollup2
THAT PATROL OFFICERS CAN USE TO

00:47:28.579 --> 00:47:32.183 region:rollup2
HELP THEM IDENTIFY WHAT TYPE OF

00:47:30.181 --> 00:47:33.384 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE IS NECESSARY TO

00:47:32.183 --> 00:47:34.719 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY A HATE CRIME.

00:47:33.384 --> 00:47:35.953 region:rollup2
WHAT TYPE OF VICTIMS THEY SHOULD

00:47:34.719 --> 00:47:36.687 region:rollup2
BE INTERVIEWING WHAT TYPE OF

00:47:35.953 --> 00:47:37.621 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE THAT SHOULD BE

00:47:36.687 --> 00:47:39.090 region:rollup2
GATHERING?

00:47:37.621 --> 00:47:39.690 region:rollup2
AND WE FOUND THAT THE

00:47:39.090 --> 00:47:41.826 region:rollup2
SUPPLEMENTAL HE CRIME REPORTS

00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:43.561 region:rollup2
WERE ONLY USED A TWO OF THE FOUR

00:47:41.826 --> 00:47:45.596 region:rollup2
ENTITIES WE REVIEWED --

00:47:43.561 --> 00:47:47.598 region:rollup2
IS AN ORANGE COUNTY AND

00:47:45.596 --> 00:47:48.532 region:rollup2
STANISLAUS DIDN'T USE THAT I

00:47:47.598 --> 00:47:50.067 region:rollup2
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT POST

00:47:48.532 --> 00:47:52.370 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDS IS A IS A REALLY

00:47:50.067 --> 00:47:53.738 region:rollup2
CRITICAL TOOL TO USE.

00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:55.106 region:rollup2
WHEN IDENTIFYING HATE CRIMES?

00:47:53.738 --> 00:47:57.074 region:rollup2
AND THE SECOND ISSUE WE FOUND AS

00:47:55.106 --> 00:47:58.542 region:rollup2
A CAUSE WAS INADEQUATE POLICIES

00:47:57.074 --> 00:48:00.277 region:rollup2
SO SAN FRANCISCO STATE

00:47:58.542 --> 00:48:02.012 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY FOR EXAMPLE.

00:48:00.277 --> 00:48:03.347 region:rollup2
WAS ARE USING INCORRECT

00:48:02.012 --> 00:48:04.815 region:rollup2
STATUTORY DEFINITION OF HATE

00:48:03.347 --> 00:48:06.117 region:rollup2
CRIMES IN THEIR POLICY AND AS A

00:48:04.815 --> 00:48:07.385 region:rollup2
RESULT THEIR OFFICERS WERE NOT

00:48:06.117 --> 00:48:08.719 region:rollup2
ABLE TO CORRECTLY IDENTIFY

00:48:07.385 --> 00:48:10.755 region:rollup2
CRIMES.

00:48:08.719 --> 00:48:11.922 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY TRAINING --

00:48:10.755 --> 00:48:13.390 region:rollup2
AND PERIODIC TRAINING IS

00:48:11.922 --> 00:48:15.326 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY NOT REQUIRED OF

00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:16.460 region:rollup2
OFFICERS IT'S ONLY REQUIRED ONE

00:48:15.326 --> 00:48:18.162 region:rollup2
TIME AND THAT'S WHEN THAT THE

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:19.764 region:rollup2
POLICE OFFICER ACADEMY.

00:48:18.162 --> 00:48:21.565 region:rollup2
AND WE FOUND THAT THIS IS AGAIN

00:48:19.764 --> 00:48:23.100 region:rollup2
IS A BIG ISSUE NOT AT THE NOT

00:48:21.565 --> 00:48:24.468 region:rollup2
JUST THE FOR ENTITIES WE VISITED

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:26.837 region:rollup2
BUT STATEWIDE.

00:48:24.468 --> 00:48:28.038 region:rollup2
WE FOUND THAT 50% OF OUR SURVEY

00:48:26.837 --> 00:48:30.174 region:rollup2
RESPONDENTS --

00:48:28.038 --> 00:48:31.675 region:rollup2
IT PROVIDED NO SORT OF PERIODIC

00:48:30.174 --> 00:48:32.843 region:rollup2
REFRESHER TRAINING REGARDING

00:48:31.675 --> 00:48:34.879 region:rollup2
HATE CRIMES.

00:48:32.843 --> 00:48:36.147 region:rollup2
AS WE KNOW THESE ARE NOT STATIC

00:48:34.879 --> 00:48:37.715 region:rollup2
ISSUES THEY REALLY REQUIRE UP TO

00:48:36.147 --> 00:48:40.050 region:rollup2
DATE KNOWLEDGE ON WHAT'S GOING

00:48:37.715 --> 00:48:43.421 region:rollup2
ON AND UNFORTUNATELY --

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:43.988 region:rollup2
AT LEAST HALF SEE WIDER.

00:48:43.421 --> 00:48:47.124 region:rollup2
REFRESHER TRAINING FOR THEIR

00:48:43.988 --> 00:48:48.793 region:rollup2
OFFICER.

00:48:47.124 --> 00:48:51.061 region:rollup2
OUR SECOND KEY FINING RELATES TO

00:48:48.793 --> 00:48:52.630 region:rollup2
PROSECUTION AND THE BIG ISSUE

00:48:51.061 --> 00:48:54.331 region:rollup2
THERE ARE WAS THAT PROSECUTORS

00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:56.400 region:rollup2
ARE ONLY AVERAGING CONVICTION

00:48:54.331 --> 00:48:57.334 region:rollup2
RATES AT ABOUT HALF THE RATE FOR

00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:58.969 region:rollup2
HE CRIMES.

00:48:57.334 --> 00:49:01.605 region:rollup2
THAN THEY ARE FOR ALL FELONIES

00:48:58.969 --> 00:49:03.207 region:rollup2
OF THE STATE SETS ABOUT 46% BY

00:49:01.605 --> 00:49:03.874 region:rollup2
THE PROSECUTION RATE FOR HATE

00:49:03.207 --> 00:49:05.943 region:rollup2
CRIMES.

00:49:03.874 --> 00:49:07.545 region:rollup2
VERSES 84% FOR ALL TYPES OF

00:49:05.943 --> 00:49:08.879 region:rollup2
FELONIES --

00:49:07.545 --> 00:49:11.882 region:rollup2
THEY'RE A LOT OF FACTORS THAT

00:49:08.879 --> 00:49:13.517 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTE TO THIS OF A PRIMARY

00:49:11.882 --> 00:49:14.752 region:rollup2
ONE IS PROVING MOTIVE THAT'S

00:49:13.517 --> 00:49:16.320 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO PROVE.

00:49:14.752 --> 00:49:17.955 region:rollup2
A SUSPECT'S MOTIVE TO GET A HATE

00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:19.256 region:rollup2
CRIME CONVICTION.

00:49:17.955 --> 00:49:21.258 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN WE INTERVIEWED THE FOR

00:49:19.256 --> 00:49:22.893 region:rollup2
DISTRICT ATTORNEYS WHAT WE FOUND

00:49:21.258 --> 00:49:25.763 region:rollup2
WAS A LACK OF IDENTIFIABLE

00:49:22.893 --> 00:49:27.698 region:rollup2
SUSPECTS THIS IS ABOUT 30%.

00:49:25.763 --> 00:49:29.099 region:rollup2
OF OF HATE CRIMES ACTUALLY DON'T

00:49:27.698 --> 00:49:30.901 region:rollup2
HAVE A SUSPECT IT'S IDENTIFIED

00:49:29.099 --> 00:49:32.770 region:rollup2
AT ALL WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO

00:49:30.901 --> 00:49:34.371 region:rollup2
DIFFICULTY IN PROSECUTION.

00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:35.706 region:rollup2
WE ALSO FOUND LACK OF SUFFICIENT

00:49:34.371 --> 00:49:37.174 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE SO THIS IS SOMETHING

00:49:35.706 --> 00:49:38.409 region:rollup2
THAT PROSECUTORS SAID WAS VERY

00:49:37.174 --> 00:49:39.944 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT FOR THEM.

00:49:38.409 --> 00:49:40.845 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO PROSECUTE

00:49:39.944 --> 00:49:43.681 region:rollup2
HATE CRIMES IT IT HAVE ENOUGH

00:49:40.845 --> 00:49:45.816 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE AND ACTUALLY POINTED TO

00:49:43.681 --> 00:49:47.418 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT --

00:49:45.816 --> 00:49:48.752 region:rollup2
IN A BETTER WAY SUCH AS USING A

00:49:47.418 --> 00:49:50.488 region:rollup2
SUPPLEMENTAL HE CRIME REPORT

00:49:48.752 --> 00:49:52.089 region:rollup2
WHICH WOULD ASSIST THOSE

00:49:50.488 --> 00:49:53.958 region:rollup2
PROSECUTORS AND HAVING BETTER

00:49:52.089 --> 00:49:57.261 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE TO CONVICT.

00:49:53.958 --> 00:49:58.996 region:rollup2
THOSE SUSPECTS OF HATE CRIMES.

00:49:57.261 --> 00:50:00.297 region:rollup2
I IS A STATE ARE MENTIONED ALSO

00:49:58.996 --> 00:50:01.499 region:rollup2
UNDER REPORTING IS A BIG ISSUE

00:50:00.297 --> 00:50:03.534 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS AND THIS IS IN

00:50:01.499 --> 00:50:05.269 region:rollup2
ADDITION TO IDENTIFICATION OF

00:50:03.534 --> 00:50:06.937 region:rollup2
HATE CRIMES THIS IS HOW WELL OUR

00:50:05.269 --> 00:50:08.339 region:rollup2
OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SEES

00:50:06.937 --> 00:50:09.173 region:rollup2
REPORTING THE HATE CRIMES THAT

00:50:08.339 --> 00:50:10.174 region:rollup2
DO A CAR.

00:50:09.173 --> 00:50:11.609 region:rollup2
HOW WELL ARE THEY REPORTING

00:50:10.174 --> 00:50:13.444 region:rollup2
THOSE ISSUES TO THE DEPARTMENT

00:50:11.609 --> 00:50:14.478 region:rollup2
OF JUSTICE AND ULTIMATELY TO THE

00:50:13.444 --> 00:50:15.746 region:rollup2
FBI?

00:50:14.478 --> 00:50:17.114 region:rollup2
AND WE FOUND THAT THERE ARE SOME

00:50:15.746 --> 00:50:19.650 region:rollup2
ISSUES THERE AS WELL IN

00:50:17.114 --> 00:50:21.151 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR 14%.

00:50:21.151 --> 00:50:24.722 region:rollup2
IN OUR FOR JURISDICTIONS WERE

00:50:22.486 --> 00:50:25.656 region:rollup2
NOT REPORTED TO THE DEPARTMENT

00:50:24.722 --> 00:50:27.191 region:rollup2

00:50:30.561 --> 00:50:33.530 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN WHAT WE FOUND THERE IN

00:50:32.229 --> 00:50:34.532 region:rollup2
TERMS OF CAUSE WAS LACK OF

00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:36.634 region:rollup2

ENFORCEMENT LEVEL.

00:50:39.737 --> 00:50:42.873 region:rollup2

00:50:41.205 --> 00:50:44.842 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE COULD DO

00:50:42.873 --> 00:50:45.876 region:rollup2

00:50:57.955 --> 00:51:00.424 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WOULD BE

00:50:59.657 --> 00:51:03.127 region:rollup2
BENEFICIAL.

00:51:00.424 --> 00:51:04.595 region:rollup2
IN FACT OVER 80% STATEWIDE OF

00:51:03.127 --> 00:51:05.863 region:rollup2
THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES

00:51:04.595 --> 00:51:07.231 region:rollup2
THAT WE SURVEYED SAID THEY WOULD

00:51:05.863 --> 00:51:08.766 region:rollup2
LIKE MORE GUIDANCE FROM THE

00:51:07.231 --> 00:51:10.301 region:rollup2

00:51:08.766 --> 00:51:11.268 region:rollup2
RELATED TO REPORTING HATE CRIMES

00:51:10.301 --> 00:51:12.803 region:rollup2
THERE'S DEFINITELY SOME

00:51:11.268 --> 00:51:14.271 region:rollup2
CONFUSION THERE THAT COULD BE

00:51:12.803 --> 00:51:15.205 region:rollup2
ALLEVIATED IF THE DEPARTMENT OF

ADDITIONAL OUTREACH --

00:51:18.475 --> 00:51:21.145 region:rollup2
SO WE REALLY --

00:51:19.777 --> 00:51:23.047 region:rollup2
FOUND THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:51:21.145 --> 00:51:25.182 region:rollup2
JUSTICE IS UNIQUELY POSITIONED

00:51:23.047 --> 00:51:25.616 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE THIS SORT OF GUIDANCE

00:51:25.182 --> 00:51:27.685 region:rollup2

00:51:27.685 --> 00:51:31.188 region:rollup2

00:51:28.986 --> 00:51:33.624 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITIES WITH READ

00:51:31.188 --> 00:51:34.291 region:rollup2
RELATION TO COLLECTING ANALYZING

00:51:33.624 --> 00:51:36.060 region:rollup2

STATISTICS --

00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:39.196 region:rollup2
AND THEY ALSO HAVE A UNIQUE ROLE

00:51:37.761 --> 00:51:41.131 region:rollup2
IN PROVIDING GUIDANCE TO LAW

00:51:39.196 --> 00:51:42.466 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT FOR OUTREACH.

00:51:41.131 --> 00:51:44.802 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF THE EVIDENCE WE

00:51:42.466 --> 00:51:46.437 region:rollup2
REVIEWED SUGGESTS THAT OVER 50%

00:51:44.802 --> 00:51:48.339 region:rollup2
OF HATE CRIMES ARE NOT EVEN

00:51:46.437 --> 00:51:51.075 region:rollup2
REPORTED TO LAW ENFORCEMENT.

00:51:48.339 --> 00:51:52.743 region:rollup2
AND TWO OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:51:51.075 --> 00:51:53.644 region:rollup2
AGENCIES WE REVIEWED SAID

00:51:52.743 --> 00:51:56.246 region:rollup2
PROVIDING OUTREACH TO THEIR

00:51:58.949 --> 00:52:01.785 region:rollup2
AND SO --

00:51:59.817 --> 00:52:03.354 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AGAIN

00:52:01.785 --> 00:52:04.888 region:rollup2
HAS THAT ROLE WHERE THEY CAN

AND AGAIN OVER 80% OF THEM SAID

00:52:11.862 --> 00:52:14.999 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WOULD REALLY BENEFIT

00:52:13.263 --> 00:52:15.599 region:rollup2
FROM THIS TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP

00:52:14.999 --> 00:52:17.001 region:rollup2
WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

01:11:47.503 --> 01:11:50.173 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT DISTINCTION ABOUT HATE

01:11:49.605 --> 01:11:50.840 region:rollup2
CRIMES VERSUS HATE INCIDENTS

01:11:50.173 --> 01:11:52.241 region:rollup2
INTO.

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:53.810 region:rollup2
HATE INCIDENTS AND HOW THERE'S

01:11:52.241 --> 01:11:55.912 region:rollup2
SOME CONFUSION SOMETIMES THAT

01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:57.647 region:rollup2
LEADS TO UNDER REPORTING.

01:11:55.912 --> 01:12:00.082 region:rollup2
SO A HATE CRIME.

01:11:57.647 --> 01:12:01.784 region:rollup2
A HATE CRIME IS A CRIMINAL ACT.

01:12:00.082 --> 01:12:03.786 region:rollup2
COMMITTED AGAINST A PERSON A

01:12:01.784 --> 01:12:05.388 region:rollup2

THE GROUP OR THE PROPERTY.

01:12:13.329 --> 01:12:15.364 region:rollup2
NOW THE LAW PROTECTS AGAINST

01:12:14.363 --> 01:12:16.799 region:rollup2
MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF HATE

01:12:15.364 --> 01:12:18.935 region:rollup2
CRIMES.

01:12:16.799 --> 01:12:20.736 region:rollup2
INCLUDING CRIMES COMMITTED BASED

01:12:18.935 --> 01:12:22.271 region:rollup2
ON SOMEONE'S ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED

01:12:20.736 --> 01:12:23.606 region:rollup2
DISABILITY [inaudible]

GENDER.

01:12:23.606 --> 01:12:26.409 region:rollup2

01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:31.147 region:rollup2
RACE OR ETHNICITY.

01:12:30.413 --> 01:12:33.749 region:rollup2
RELIGION.

01:12:31.147 --> 01:12:35.284 region:rollup2
SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR

01:12:33.749 --> 01:12:37.019 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATION WITH SOMEONE OR A

01:12:35.284 --> 01:12:37.453 region:rollup2
GROUP THAT HAS ANY OF THESE

01:12:37.019 --> 01:12:39.488 region:rollup2
PERCEIVED OR ACTUAL

01:12:37.453 --> 01:12:41.257 region:rollup2
CHARACTERISTICS.

01:12:39.488 --> 01:12:42.525 region:rollup2
SO AGAIN CRIMINAL ACTS.

01:12:41.257 --> 01:12:43.793 region:rollup2
COMMITTED BASED IN WHOLE OR IN

01:12:42.525 --> 01:12:45.528 region:rollup2
OR IN PART BECAUSE OF ACTUAL OR

01:12:43.793 --> 01:12:47.830 region:rollup2
PERCEIVED CHARACTERISTICS.

01:12:45.528 --> 01:12:49.732 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE HATE CRIMES ALMOND AND

01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:50.399 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE WHAT THE ANNUAL REPORT

01:12:49.732 --> 01:12:51.334 region:rollup2
BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

01:12:50.399 --> 01:12:52.802 region:rollup2
JUSTICE.

01:12:51.334 --> 01:12:54.470 region:rollup2
FOCUSES ON THAT'S WHAT'S

01:12:52.802 --> 01:12:55.838 region:rollup2
REPORTED TO THE FBI.

01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:57.773 region:rollup2
IT ADDITION TO HATE CRIMES THEIR

01:12:55.838 --> 01:12:59.709 region:rollup2
HATE INCIDENTS.

01:12:57.773 --> 01:13:00.576 region:rollup2
THEIR APPARENT THEIR OFFENSIVE

01:12:59.709 --> 01:13:01.477 region:rollup2
AND NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO DEAL

01:13:00.576 --> 01:13:02.778 region:rollup2
WITH THEM.

01:13:01.477 --> 01:13:03.980 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT THEY ARE THE DEFINITION

01:13:02.778 --> 01:13:05.214 region:rollup2
OF A HATE INCIDENT WHEN WE TALK

01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:07.149 region:rollup2
ABOUT IT.

01:13:05.214 --> 01:13:08.985 region:rollup2
IS AN ACTION OR BEHAVIOR

01:13:07.149 --> 01:13:10.519 region:rollup2
MOTIVATED BY HATE.

01:13:08.985 --> 01:13:11.988 region:rollup2
BUT THAT DOESN'T RISE TO THE

01:13:10.519 --> 01:13:13.389 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF BEING THE LEGAL --

01:13:11.988 --> 01:13:14.523 region:rollup2
GENERALLY THAT'S BECAUSE IT MAY

01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:15.491 region:rollup2
BE PROTECTED BY THE FIRST

01:13:14.523 --> 01:13:17.293 region:rollup2
AMENDMENT RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF

01:13:15.491 --> 01:13:18.761 region:rollup2
EXPRESSION.

01:13:17.293 --> 01:13:20.196 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES OF HATE INCIDENTS

01:13:18.761 --> 01:13:22.331 region:rollup2
INCLUDE THINGS LIKE.

01:13:20.196 --> 01:13:23.699 region:rollup2
NAME CALLING YOUR INSULTS.

01:13:22.331 --> 01:13:25.768 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTING HATE MATERIAL IN

01:13:23.699 --> 01:13:28.004 region:rollup2
PUBLIC PLACES OR SOMEONE WHO

01:13:25.768 --> 01:13:29.572 region:rollup2

OWN PRIVATE PROPERTY.

01:13:29.572 --> 01:13:33.376 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY OFFENSIVE AND APART

01:13:31.307 --> 01:13:34.243 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR BUT DOESN'T RISE TO THE

01:13:33.376 --> 01:13:35.778 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF A CRIME.

01:13:34.243 --> 01:13:37.079 region:rollup2
AS THE AUDITOR NOTED HOWEVER

01:13:35.778 --> 01:13:38.247 region:rollup2
IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT

01:13:37.079 --> 01:13:39.415 region:rollup2
LAW ENFORCEMENT BE ABLE TO

01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:41.918 region:rollup2
DISTINGUISH.

01:13:39.415 --> 01:13:44.220 region:rollup2
AND KNOW THAT WHEN THE WHEN THE

01:13:41.918 --> 01:13:45.955 region:rollup2
CONDUCT DOES BECOME A CRIME SO

01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:47.723 region:rollup2
THAT IT ROBUST INVESTIGATION IS

01:13:45.955 --> 01:13:48.591 region:rollup2
DONE AND THERE ARE THINGS THAT.

01:13:47.723 --> 01:13:51.761 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY CAN DO TO TO MAKE

01:13:48.591 --> 01:13:52.795 region:rollup2
IT OTHER LEADERSHIP POINT THAT

KNOWN THAT HATE INCIDENTS ARE

01:13:55.665 --> 01:13:59.368 region:rollup2
NOT ONES THAT ARE ACCEPTABLE IN

01:13:57.266 --> 01:14:01.037 region:rollup2
OUR COMMUNITIES EITHER.

IF YOU WERE. TO GET INVOLVED

01:30:01.429 --> 01:30:05.166 region:rollup2

AND I THINK A LOT OF TIMES.

01:30:18.813 --> 01:30:22.684 region:rollup2
WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT GOT

01:30:19.914 --> 01:30:23.785 region:rollup2
INVOLVED IN THOSE INCIDENTS --

01:30:22.684 --> 01:30:26.688 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD JUST KIND OF LET IT

01:30:23.785 --> 01:30:29.891 region:rollup2
GO BY THE WAYSIDE --

COMPLICIT.

01:30:33.995 --> 01:30:38.433 region:rollup2
IN THOSE BEATINGS --

01:30:36.631 --> 01:30:42.537 region:rollup2

EVER BEEN TAUGHT.

01:31:33.555 --> 01:31:38.493 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S WHY IT'S

01:31:34.689 --> 01:31:40.428 region:rollup2
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US. TO TO

01:31:38.493 --> 01:31:41.730 region:rollup2
GO AHEAD AND AND DO THE DATA.

01:31:40.428 --> 01:31:43.565 region:rollup2

01:31:41.730 --> 01:31:46.034 region:rollup2
FOR US TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON

01:31:43.565 --> 01:31:48.770 region:rollup2

MORE DANGEROUS [inaudible]

01:31:59.748 --> 01:32:03.818 region:rollup2
THEN ANYTHING --

01:32:02.584 --> 01:32:05.286 region:rollup2
THAT COULD HAPPEN EVEN IN MY IN

01:32:03.818 --> 01:32:06.021 region:rollup2
MY CITY.

01:32:05.286 --> 01:32:08.390 region:rollup2
WHERE WE HAVE A SHERIFF'S

01:32:06.021 --> 01:32:11.059 region:rollup2

DIFFERENT DATE SOME OF THEM

01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:16.631 region:rollup2
DON'T BELIEVE.

01:32:14.195 --> 01:32:18.533 region:rollup2
IT HAS CAUSED SOME RACES PROBLEM

01:32:16.631 --> 01:32:20.368 region:rollup2
THAT HAPPENED LA COUNTY JAIL.

01:32:18.533 --> 01:32:21.503 region:rollup2
THEY REALLY DON'T BELIEVE THAT

01:32:20.368 --> 01:32:23.772 region:rollup2
THEY BELIEVE A PART OF A CLUB OR

01:32:21.503 --> 01:32:26.174 region:rollup2
GROUP.

01:32:23.772 --> 01:32:27.542 region:rollup2

01:32:26.174 --> 01:32:30.645 region:rollup2
ABUSES THAT GO ON IN JAIL.

01:32:27.542 --> 01:32:31.246 region:rollup2
IS BECAUSE THE CULTURE --

01:32:30.645 --> 01:32:33.314 region:rollup2
FEEDS INTO IT AND ACCOMMODATES

01:32:31.246 --> 01:32:34.682 region:rollup2
--

01:32:33.314 --> 01:32:36.317 region:rollup2
WHICH DEBT HAS RAMIFICATIONS ON

01:32:34.682 --> 01:32:37.786 region:rollup2

STOP THAT ON BUT WE NEED TO DO

01:32:43.158 --> 01:32:45.493 region:rollup2
MORE.

01:32:43.792 --> 01:32:47.061 region:rollup2

GIVEN WHAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING NOW

01:32:49.164 --> 01:32:53.835 region:rollup2
BUT I'M REALLY REALLY CONCERNED.

01:32:51.266 --> 01:32:55.837 region:rollup2
ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT ROLE.

01:32:53.835 --> 01:32:56.371 region:rollup2
IN HATE CRIMES IS NOT ONLY IN

01:32:55.837 --> 01:32:57.605 region:rollup2
THE STATE BUT ACROSS THIS

01:32:56.371 --> 01:32:59.307 region:rollup2

01:32:57.605 --> 01:33:01.376 region:rollup2
SPECIAL WITTY THE ATMOSPHERE

01:32:59.307 --> 01:33:03.244 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW --

01:33:01.376 --> 01:33:05.847 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE?

01:33:03.244 --> 01:33:07.248 region:rollup2
AFTER SOMEONE GETS SOME THE BEST

01:33:05.847 --> 01:33:08.116 region:rollup2
TRAINING IN THE WORLD AND I

01:33:07.248 --> 01:33:09.884 region:rollup2

ENFORCEMENT IS THE BEST LAW.

01:33:09.884 --> 01:33:13.254 region:rollup2
A BUS TRAIN IN WORLD.

01:33:11.753 --> 01:33:15.457 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE KEEP THAT TRAINING

01:33:13.254 --> 01:33:16.791 region:rollup2
MOVING FORWARD? TO GET RID OF

01:33:15.457 --> 01:33:18.893 region:rollup2
THAT IN BED IT PREJUDICE IN

01:33:16.791 --> 01:33:21.329 region:rollup2
THEIR HEADS [inaudible]

01:33:18.893 --> 01:33:23.798 region:rollup2
THAT [inaudible]

01:33:21.329 --> 01:33:24.399 region:rollup2
IS REINFORCED.

01:33:23.798 --> 01:33:26.201 region:rollup2
THROUGH PRACTICES THAT ARE NOT

01:33:24.399 --> 01:33:28.203 region:rollup2
--

01:33:26.201 --> 01:33:30.939 region:rollup2
SANCTION.

01:33:28.203 --> 01:33:31.506 region:rollup2
BY EITHER LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE

01:33:30.939 --> 01:33:33.041 region:rollup2
CHIEF OF POLICE OR EVEN THE

01:33:31.506 --> 01:33:35.410 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT.

01:33:33.041 --> 01:33:36.678 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S GOING ON ANYWAY.

01:33:35.410 --> 01:33:38.313 region:rollup2
PERMISSIVE IN THE SYSTEM HOW DO

01:33:36.678 --> 01:33:39.714 region:rollup2
WE GET.

01:33:38.313 --> 01:33:42.484 region:rollup2
DID THAT AND THAT'S KIND OF MY

01:33:39.714 --> 01:33:44.619 region:rollup2
QUESTION HOW DO WE REALLY GET.

01:33:42.484 --> 01:33:47.555 region:rollup2
INTO STOPPING AND IN OBVIOUSLY

01:33:44.619 --> 01:33:50.225 region:rollup2
ELITES INTO --

01:33:47.555 --> 01:33:51.025 region:rollup2

01:33:50.225 --> 01:33:52.594 region:rollup2
WHO HAPPEN LOOK LOT LIKE ME?

01:33:51.025 --> 01:33:55.296 region:rollup2
IN THE BACK [inaudible]

01:33:52.594 --> 01:33:58.166 region:rollup2
UNARMED.

01:33:55.296 --> 01:33:59.934 region:rollup2
AND HOW DO WE PREVENT THAT

01:33:58.166 --> 01:34:00.802 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WHETHER IT'S FEAR.

01:33:59.934 --> 01:34:01.402 region:rollup2
WAS FAIR BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN

01:34:00.802 --> 01:34:02.704 region:rollup2
TAUGHT.

01:34:01.402 --> 01:34:05.907 region:rollup2
THAT A CERTAIN SEGMENT OF

01:34:02.704 --> 01:34:06.407 region:rollup2
POPULATION IS IS DANGEROUS.

01:34:05.907 --> 01:34:09.377 region:rollup2
NO MATTER HOW LOUD THEIR

01:34:06.407 --> 01:34:11.746 region:rollup2
SECRETIVE BUT THEY'RE DANGEROUS.

01:34:09.377 --> 01:34:13.982 region:rollup2
AND SO IT'S OKAY.

01:34:11.746 --> 01:34:15.083 region:rollup2
IF YOU UNDER SELF PRESERVATION

01:34:13.982 --> 01:34:15.750 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN TAUGHT AND

01:34:15.083 --> 01:34:17.519 region:rollup2
TRAINED.

01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:19.787 region:rollup2
THAT YOU NEED.

01:34:17.519 --> 01:34:21.623 region:rollup2
TO OP DEFEND YOURSELF.

01:34:19.787 --> 01:34:22.957 region:rollup2
AGAINST ANY ACTIONS HOW DO WE

01:34:21.623 --> 01:34:26.928 region:rollup2
WORK WITH [inaudible]

01:34:22.957 --> 01:34:27.795 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT. TO BRING HIM UP.

01:34:26.928 --> 01:34:30.431 region:rollup2
TO TO A STANDARD THAT WE ALL

01:34:27.795 --> 01:34:31.666 region:rollup2
WILL BE PROUD OF AND THAT IT

01:34:30.431 --> 01:34:33.334 region:rollup2
DOESN'T GET UNDERMINE.

01:34:31.666 --> 01:34:35.837 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT I DID.

01:34:33.334 --> 01:34:37.172 region:rollup2
LAW ENFORCEMENT DA'S OF ATTORNEY

01:34:35.837 --> 01:34:38.373 region:rollup2
GENERALS ARE DOING OR IN WHAT

01:34:37.172 --> 01:34:39.908 region:rollup2
WE'RE DOING IN OUR TRAINING THAT

01:34:38.373 --> 01:34:42.143 region:rollup2
ALL GETS [inaudible]

01:34:39.908 --> 01:34:43.344 region:rollup2
GOES WAY.

01:34:42.143 --> 01:34:45.013 region:rollup2
AND ONE DAY LIKE IN TRAINING DAY

01:34:43.344 --> 01:34:46.314 region:rollup2
COULD JUST GO AWAY ONE DAY.

01:34:45.013 --> 01:34:48.850 region:rollup2
AND NEXT THING YOU KNOW.

01:34:46.314 --> 01:34:50.685 region:rollup2
WE HAVE ANOTHER INCIDENT SO MY

01:34:48.850 --> 01:34:52.253 region:rollup2
QUESTION IS HOW DO WE GET TO THE

01:34:50.685 --> 01:34:57.825 region:rollup2
ROOT OF WHAT'S GONE ON IN LAW

01:34:52.253 --> 01:34:58.459 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT RIGHT NOW.

01:34:57.825 --> 01:34:59.327 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT --

01:34:58.459 --> 01:35:01.162 region:rollup2
I WILL ECHO SOMETHING YOU SAID

01:34:59.327 --> 01:35:02.864 region:rollup2
EARLY ON WAS --

01:35:01.162 --> 01:35:04.832 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO STUDY --

01:35:02.864 --> 01:35:07.502 region:rollup2
IS STARTING PLACE BUT I THINK --

01:35:04.832 --> 01:35:09.704 region:rollup2
AS IN ADDITION --

01:35:07.502 --> 01:35:11.606 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE ABILITY OF THE

01:35:09.704 --> 01:35:13.675 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

01:35:11.606 --> 01:35:15.710 region:rollup2
TO INTERCEDE ERA INTERSECT WITH

01:35:13.675 --> 01:35:18.479 region:rollup2
WITH SOME OF THESE ISSUES.

01:35:15.710 --> 01:35:19.747 region:rollup2
LAWYER AND MAYBE SOME ASSISTANCE

01:35:18.479 --> 01:35:20.481 region:rollup2
FROM THE LEGISLATURE TO GIVE US

01:35:19.747 --> 01:35:23.318 region:rollup2
THE AUTHORITY OF CERTAIN

01:35:20.481 --> 01:35:24.619 region:rollup2
INSTANCES. TO COMPEL AGENCIES TO

01:35:23.318 --> 01:35:25.920 region:rollup2
REPORT CERTAIN THINGS TO

01:35:24.619 --> 01:35:27.622 region:rollup2
SANCTION OF THEM WHEN THEY DON'T

01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:29.390 region:rollup2
I THINK ONE OF THE SOME OF THE

01:35:27.622 --> 01:35:30.692 region:rollup2
PROBLEM WITH THE REPORTING IS A

01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:32.126 region:rollup2
LACK OF ANY ACCOUNTABILITY ARE

01:35:30.692 --> 01:35:34.896 region:rollup2
ANY ANY ANY --

01:35:32.126 --> 01:35:36.798 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES. FOR NOT BEING

01:35:34.896 --> 01:35:37.332 region:rollup2
TIMELY WITH THE DATA OF FOR NOT

01:35:36.798 --> 01:35:38.233 region:rollup2
SUBMITTING THE DATA AND SO

01:35:37.332 --> 01:35:40.802 region:rollup2
FORTH.

01:35:38.233 --> 01:35:41.970 region:rollup2
ARM IN REGARDS.

01:35:40.802 --> 01:35:43.471 region:rollup2
TO CULTURAL.

01:35:41.970 --> 01:35:45.206 region:rollup2
BEHAVIORS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT I

01:35:43.471 --> 01:35:46.641 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THE PROFESSOR THAT

01:35:45.206 --> 01:35:49.644 region:rollup2
WAS UP A NEW.

01:35:46.641 --> 01:35:50.812 region:rollup2
PANEL MENTIONED --

01:35:49.644 --> 01:35:53.648 region:rollup2
GUIDANCE FROM THE TOP OR OR OR

01:35:50.812 --> 01:35:55.083 region:rollup2
OR OR PARDEE SETTING.

01:35:53.648 --> 01:35:56.084 region:rollup2
AND IT FROM THE OF FROM THE TOP

01:35:55.083 --> 01:35:57.852 region:rollup2
OF THE ORGANIZATION I THINK THAT

01:35:56.084 --> 01:35:59.420 region:rollup2
WHEN.

01:35:57.852 --> 01:35:59.887 region:rollup2
WE TARGET.

01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:01.723 region:rollup2
THE LEADERS OF THOSE

01:35:59.887 --> 01:36:03.124 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS AND AND THAT THE

01:36:01.723 --> 01:36:04.125 region:rollup2
MESSAGE TO THAT ORGANIZATION IS

01:36:03.124 --> 01:36:06.294 region:rollup2
A CERTAIN TYPES OF BEHAVIOR

01:36:04.125 --> 01:36:08.796 region:rollup2
WON'T BE TOLERATED WILL BE.

01:36:06.294 --> 01:36:10.098 region:rollup2
DON'T WITH WHEN NECK TYPE OF

01:36:08.796 --> 01:36:12.100 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR IS UNDERTAKEN THOSE

01:36:10.098 --> 01:36:12.867 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS I THINK THOSE

01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:14.669 region:rollup2
STARTING PLACES --

01:36:12.867 --> 01:36:16.204 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK.

01:36:14.669 --> 01:36:17.372 region:rollup2
AGAIN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AS YOU

01:36:16.204 --> 01:36:18.506 region:rollup2
MENTION WITH --

01:36:17.372 --> 01:36:19.540 region:rollup2
THE EXAMPLE WITH YOUR COUSIN

01:36:18.506 --> 01:36:19.841 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME DEEP SEATED

01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:22.844 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:36:19.841 --> 01:36:24.145 region:rollup2
SOCIAL.

01:36:22.844 --> 01:36:24.746 region:rollup2
IDEAS THAT GUY THAT COME INTO

01:36:24.145 --> 01:36:25.980 region:rollup2
PLAY IN SOME THOSE ISSUES THAT

01:36:24.746 --> 01:36:27.015 region:rollup2
YOU MENTIONED.

01:36:25.980 --> 01:36:28.249 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT --

01:36:27.015 --> 01:36:28.883 region:rollup2
WE AS A SOCIETY RIGHT NOW

01:36:28.249 --> 01:36:31.953 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY TRYING TO GET AT THOSE

01:36:28.883 --> 01:36:33.221 region:rollup2
ISSUES TRY AND MAKE US.

01:36:31.953 --> 01:36:33.855 region:rollup2
ALL BETTER --

01:36:33.221 --> 01:36:36.090 region:rollup2
WHETHER WE'RE LAW ENFORCERS OR

01:36:33.855 --> 01:36:37.025 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER PROFESSIONAL OR WALK

01:36:36.090 --> 01:36:39.727 region:rollup2
OF LIFE.

01:36:37.025 --> 01:36:41.095 region:rollup2
UP SO I THINK THAT. FOR US SOME

01:36:39.727 --> 01:36:42.997 region:rollup2
OF THE MEDIA SYSTEMS WILL BE

01:36:41.095 --> 01:36:44.432 region:rollup2
WOULD BE ASSISTANCE FROM.

01:36:42.997 --> 01:36:45.800 region:rollup2
WOULD LEGISLATION THAT GOD WOULD

01:36:44.432 --> 01:36:47.735 region:rollup2
HELP US TO COMPEL SOME OF THAT

01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:49.170 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S IT IT'S IT'S ALSO PUT

01:36:47.735 --> 01:36:52.306 region:rollup2
US IN A POSITION TO CONTINUE OUR

01:36:49.170 --> 01:36:53.608 region:rollup2
REACH THAT WE USED TO DO MORE

01:36:52.306 --> 01:36:56.844 region:rollup2
RIGOROUSLY WHEN WE HAD A A

01:36:53.608 --> 01:36:58.613 region:rollup2
BETTER RESOURCES TO DO IT --

01:36:56.844 --> 01:37:00.081 region:rollup2
TO CONNECT THOSE COMMUNITIES IN

01:36:58.613 --> 01:37:00.648 region:rollup2
THOSE LAW FORCE NATIONS WITH

01:37:00.081 --> 01:37:02.050 region:rollup2
THEIR COMMUNITY SO THAT THEY

01:37:00.648 --> 01:37:02.984 region:rollup2
ARE.

01:37:02.050 --> 01:37:04.385 region:rollup2
NOT.

01:37:02.984 --> 01:37:06.387 region:rollup2
AN OCCUPYING FORCE THAT THEY SEE

01:37:04.385 --> 01:37:08.122 region:rollup2
PEOPLE FOR UP FOR THE FOR THE

01:37:06.387 --> 01:37:09.924 region:rollup2
HUMANNESS AS OPPOSED. TO FOR

01:37:08.122 --> 01:37:12.860 region:rollup2
WHAT THE ACTIVE MAY BE INVOLVED

01:37:09.924 --> 01:37:14.095 region:rollup2
IN OR WHAT OUTPUT OF THE*

01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:15.029 region:rollup2
PORTRAYED IN OUR SOCIETY THE

01:37:14.095 --> 01:37:16.898 region:rollup2
MEDIA WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE

01:37:15.029 --> 01:37:17.532 region:rollup2
THAT CAUSES ONE TO LOOK AT AND

01:37:16.898 --> 01:37:18.700 region:rollup2
OTHERS.

01:37:17.532 --> 01:37:22.503 region:rollup2
AS OTHER AS AS SOMEONE WHO IS

01:37:18.700 --> 01:37:23.071 region:rollup2
DANGEROUS AGAIN THERE'S BEEN

01:37:22.503 --> 01:37:24.272 region:rollup2
MENTION ABOUT THE NATIONAL

01:37:23.071 --> 01:37:25.206 region:rollup2
RHETORIC --

01:37:24.272 --> 01:37:27.442 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF THOSE THINGS PLAY

01:37:25.206 --> 01:37:28.609 region:rollup2
INTO ITS IF THE OVERALL PSYCHE

01:37:27.442 --> 01:37:29.977 region:rollup2
OF OF THIS PROBLEM AND I THINK

01:37:28.609 --> 01:37:31.512 region:rollup2
AGAIN IT'S A SOCIAL ISSUE THAT

01:37:29.977 --> 01:37:32.980 region:rollup2
WE ARE WORKING AS A AND

01:37:31.512 --> 01:37:33.881 region:rollup2
SOCIETIES TRYING TO BETTER AB

01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:36.117 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK IN THE SHORT TERM

01:37:33.881 --> 01:37:37.785 region:rollup2
THAT. TO GIVE US SOME OF THE

01:37:36.117 --> 01:37:39.487 region:rollup2
RESOURCES THAT ARE NECESSARY. TO

01:37:37.785 --> 01:37:39.987 region:rollup2
GET AT CONNECTING ARC OUR LOW

01:37:39.487 --> 01:37:42.190 region:rollup2
FORCE NATIONS WITH THE

01:37:39.987 --> 01:37:44.425 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES TO GIVE US RESOURCES

01:37:42.190 --> 01:37:45.993 region:rollup2
TO IDENTIFY TRAINING NEEDS. TO

01:37:44.425 --> 01:37:48.663 region:rollup2
HOLD THOSE ACCOUNTABLE IN THOSE

01:37:45.993 --> 01:37:50.264 region:rollup2
POSITIONS TO MAKE SURE THOSE --

01:37:48.663 --> 01:37:51.933 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THE THINGS THAT WE

01:37:50.264 --> 01:37:53.267 region:rollup2
WISH TO BE DONE AND THE IN THE

01:37:51.933 --> 01:37:57.905 region:rollup2
WAY WE PLACE OUR SOCIETIES ARE

01:37:53.267 --> 01:37:59.807 region:rollup2
DONE ORGANIZATIONS.

01:37:57.905 --> 01:38:01.409 region:rollup2
I JUST WANT TO SAY I LOVE THE

01:37:59.807 --> 01:38:02.610 region:rollup2
JACKET MYSELF --

01:38:01.409 --> 01:38:03.845 region:rollup2
I I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THE

01:38:02.610 --> 01:38:05.446 region:rollup2
CHIEF GARDENERS BOB SAID I WOULD

01:38:03.845 --> 01:38:07.115 region:rollup2
I WOULD --

01:38:05.446 --> 01:38:08.282 region:rollup2
AB I THINK THE LEADERSHIP PIECE

01:38:07.115 --> 01:38:09.717 region:rollup2
IS CRITICAL ONE OF THE THINGS

01:38:08.282 --> 01:38:11.386 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:38:09.717 --> 01:38:12.520 region:rollup2
I HAVE HEARD SAID FROM THOSE IN

01:38:11.386 --> 01:38:13.788 region:rollup2
LAW ENFORCEMENT IS THAT ONE OF

01:38:12.520 --> 01:38:15.656 region:rollup2
THE MOST POWERFUL.

01:38:13.788 --> 01:38:17.525 region:rollup2
TOOLS IN ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:38:15.656 --> 01:38:19.427 region:rollup2
AGENCY IS THE PODIUM.

01:38:17.525 --> 01:38:20.795 region:rollup2
THE WORDS THAT ARE SAID EVERYDAY

01:38:19.427 --> 01:38:21.729 region:rollup2
BY LEADERS WHO ARE AT THE PODIUM

01:38:20.795 --> 01:38:23.231 region:rollup2
WHETHER TO SERGEANT LIEUTENANT

01:38:21.729 --> 01:38:23.965 region:rollup2
CAPTAIN.

01:38:23.231 --> 01:38:25.666 region:rollup2
CHIEF --

01:38:23.965 --> 01:38:27.535 region:rollup2
COMMISSIONER.

01:38:25.666 --> 01:38:29.404 region:rollup2
THOSE THOSE THINGS MATTER AND SO

01:38:27.535 --> 01:38:31.139 region:rollup2
I THINK TO THE EXTENT THAT.

01:38:29.404 --> 01:38:32.173 region:rollup2
WE AS A COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA

01:38:31.139 --> 01:38:34.442 region:rollup2
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT CERTAIN

01:38:32.173 --> 01:38:35.076 region:rollup2
VALUES ARE BAKED INTO THE WAY

01:38:34.442 --> 01:38:36.244 region:rollup2
THAT OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:38:35.076 --> 01:38:38.813 region:rollup2
AGENCIES.

01:38:36.244 --> 01:38:40.548 region:rollup2
AND OUR OFFICERS ENFORCE THE LAW

01:38:38.813 --> 01:38:42.049 region:rollup2
A RELATE TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS

01:38:40.548 --> 01:38:44.318 region:rollup2
THAT THAT IT'S IT'S ALL

01:38:42.049 --> 01:38:45.953 region:rollup2
CONNECTED IT CAN'T BE A ONE OFF

01:38:44.318 --> 01:38:48.289 region:rollup2
NOT ON THIS TOPIC NOT ON ANY OF

01:38:45.953 --> 01:38:49.157 region:rollup2
THE OTHER RELATED ISSUES IT'S

01:38:48.289 --> 01:38:52.460 region:rollup2
ALSO ABOUT ENSURING THAT.

01:38:49.157 --> 01:38:53.661 region:rollup2
A YOU KNOW WE DO WORK TO THE

01:38:52.460 --> 01:38:55.329 region:rollup2
EXTENT POSSIBLE TO ENSURE THAT

01:38:53.661 --> 01:38:56.197 region:rollup2
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.

01:38:55.329 --> 01:38:57.365 region:rollup2
ARE --

01:38:56.197 --> 01:38:58.900 region:rollup2
REFLECTIVE OF THE COMMUNITIES

01:38:57.365 --> 01:38:59.901 region:rollup2
THAT THEY SERVE --

01:38:58.900 --> 01:39:02.069 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW INCLUDING RACIAL

01:38:59.901 --> 01:39:03.771 region:rollup2
IDENTITY GENDER EXPRESSION AND

01:39:02.069 --> 01:39:05.406 region:rollup2
RELIGIOUS IDENTITY ON AND ON AND

01:39:03.771 --> 01:39:06.574 region:rollup2
ON I THINK THAT'S ALSO ONE WAY

01:39:05.406 --> 01:39:08.509 region:rollup2
TO HELP GET THIS.

01:39:06.574 --> 01:39:09.811 region:rollup2
THERE'S THERE'S NO SINGLE ANSWER

01:39:08.509 --> 01:39:11.179 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO MAGIC BULLET BUT I

01:39:09.811 --> 01:39:12.847 region:rollup2
THINK -- THE

01:39:11.179 --> 01:39:13.714 region:rollup2
FINAL THING I'LL SAY IS PICKING

01:39:12.847 --> 01:39:15.216 region:rollup2
BACKING ON THE RHETORIC POINT

01:39:13.714 --> 01:39:16.551 region:rollup2
THE CHIEF CARTER MADE I THINK

01:39:15.216 --> 01:39:18.152 region:rollup2
THE MORE THAT.

01:39:16.551 --> 01:39:19.320 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY LEADERS

01:39:18.152 --> 01:39:20.755 region:rollup2
LIKE YOURSELVES LEADERS LIKE

TODAY.

01:39:22.223 --> 01:39:25.092 region:rollup2
WE COUNTER THE DIVISIVE RHETORIC

01:39:23.825 --> 01:39:26.527 region:rollup2
IT'S COMING OUT OF WASHINGTON

01:39:25.092 --> 01:39:28.062 region:rollup2
AND MAKE IT CLEAR THAT.

01:39:26.527 --> 01:39:30.064 region:rollup2
IN THE GOLDEN STATE THIS WON'T

01:39:28.062 --> 01:39:30.898 region:rollup2
BE TOLERATED AND THE LEADERS IN

01:39:30.064 --> 01:39:32.266 region:rollup2
OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES

01:39:30.898 --> 01:39:34.035 region:rollup2
HAVE TO TAKE EVERY SINGLE

01:39:32.266 --> 01:39:35.636 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY NOT JUST.

01:39:34.035 --> 01:39:37.405 region:rollup2
IN THE END IN AN ANNUAL TRAINING

I HAVE THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION --

01:43:05.212 --> 01:43:07.848 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE OF WHAT I WAS A YOUNG

01:43:06.847 --> 01:43:09.784 region:rollup2
POLICE OFFICER A YOUNGER OUT

01:43:12.987 --> 01:43:15.990 region:rollup2
AND THAT THE KIDS ARE.

01:43:14.855 --> 01:43:17.258 region:rollup2
MOHAMMED WAS GOING THROUGH A

01:43:15.990 --> 01:43:18.793 region:rollup2
DIVORCE WAS FATHER'S OF

01:43:17.258 --> 01:43:20.695 region:rollup2

BECAME A KID THAT I AMID TOWARD

01:43:20.695 --> 01:43:22.897 region:rollup2
AND THEN I PICKED UP

01:43:21.862 --> 01:43:24.298 region:rollup2
OCCASIONALLY WITH HIS MOTHER'S

01:43:22.897 --> 01:43:25.966 region:rollup2
PERMISSION IS A PATRICIA THE

01:43:24.298 --> 01:43:26.634 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT TO COME ON RIDE

01:43:25.966 --> 01:43:28.703 region:rollup2
ALONGS AND TRIED TO TALK TO HIM.

01:43:26.634 --> 01:43:32.206 region:rollup2
AND MENTOR HIM ALONE.

01:43:28.703 --> 01:43:33.074 region:rollup2
AND HAS TIME WENT BY I LOST

01:43:32.206 --> 01:43:34.875 region:rollup2
CONTACT WITH MY RAN INTO HIM

01:43:33.074 --> 01:43:37.211 region:rollup2
AGAIN ANOTHER DAY AND HE WAS A

01:43:34.875 --> 01:43:38.879 region:rollup2
SKINHEAD AND  <u><c.green>HAD.</c></u>

01:43:37.211 --> 01:43:40.881 region:rollup2
HE HAD JOINED OF THE SKINHEADS

01:43:38.879 --> 01:43:41.682 region:rollup2
AND HE HAD A DIFFERENT RESPONSE

01:43:40.881 --> 01:43:43.350 region:rollup2
TO ME THAN IT PREVIOUSLY HAD

01:43:41.682 --> 01:43:44.618 region:rollup2
WHEN I WAS.

01:43:43.350 --> 01:43:45.720 region:rollup2
I TRIED TO MENTOR HIM THROUGH

01:43:44.618 --> 01:43:48.255 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE PROBLEMS HE WAS

01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:49.757 region:rollup2
HAVING HIS WHOLE --

01:43:48.255 --> 01:43:50.991 region:rollup2
I TRIED TO REACH HIM THEN AND

01:43:49.757 --> 01:43:52.293 region:rollup2
TALK TO HIM ABOUT --

01:43:50.991 --> 01:43:53.761 region:rollup2
AND RECONNECT WITH HIM ABOUT

01:43:52.293 --> 01:43:54.995 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAD.

01:43:53.761 --> 01:43:58.699 region:rollup2
BEEN ABLE SPEAK WITH PRIOR --

01:43:54.995 --> 01:44:01.035 region:rollup2
BUT BUT AT THAT TIME A HE WAS

01:43:58.699 --> 01:44:02.269 region:rollup2
LOST TO THAT AND SO I DON'T KNOW

01:44:01.035 --> 01:44:03.537 region:rollup2
I HAVEN'T EPT UP WITH THEM AS

01:44:02.269 --> 01:44:05.072 region:rollup2
PART NUMBER OF YEARS AGO.

01:44:03.537 --> 01:44:07.441 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THAT THE LARGER

01:44:05.072 --> 01:44:08.042 region:rollup2
<u><c.red>SSUE IN THAT CASE WAS THAT THE</c></u>

01:44:07.441 --> 01:44:10.277 region:rollup2
SITUATION AT CONNECT KIDS HOME

01:44:08.042 --> 01:44:12.780 region:rollup2
--

01:44:10.277 --> 01:44:13.948 region:rollup2
WERE SO UNSETTLED THAT THAT HE

01:44:12.780 --> 01:44:16.584 region:rollup2
WAS SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING TO

01:44:13.948 --> 01:44:17.318 region:rollup2
BE APART OF AND AND THAT THAT'S

01:44:16.584 --> 01:44:18.786 region:rollup2
WHAT HE CONNECTED WITH.

01:44:17.318 --> 01:44:19.386 region:rollup2
I HATE TO HAVE THE EXAMPLE OF

01:44:18.786 --> 01:44:21.589 region:rollup2
SOMEONE GOING OF THE OPPOSITE

01:44:19.386 --> 01:44:22.556 region:rollup2
DIRECTION.

01:44:21.589 --> 01:44:24.225 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S NOT A SECRET PLACE

01:44:22.556 --> 01:44:25.993 region:rollup2
MOST PRONE EXAMPLE THAT THAT HAS

01:44:24.225 --> 01:44:26.627 region:rollup2
STUCK WITH ME THROUGH THAT WAS

01:44:25.993 --> 01:44:28.596 region:rollup2
THAT WAS OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS

01:44:26.627 --> 01:44:29.964 region:rollup2
AGO.

01:44:28.596 --> 01:44:31.198 region:rollup2
AND WE THINK WE COULD AND BETTER

01:44:29.964 --> 01:44:34.034 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT WOULD YOU RISK

01:44:31.198 --> 01:44:34.602 region:rollup2
ANALYSES THE FACTORS THAT WERE

01:44:34.034 --> 01:44:35.469 region:rollup2
YOU MEANS IT'S PLAN OUT YOUR

01:44:34.602 --> 01:44:36.137 region:rollup2
HEAD I MEAN.

01:44:35.469 --> 01:44:39.240 region:rollup2
I THINK THE ONLY THING THAT UP

01:44:36.137 --> 01:44:40.307 region:rollup2
WELL I SUPPOSE I HAD I

01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:41.609 region:rollup2
MAINTAINED CONTACT WITH HIM AND

01:44:40.307 --> 01:44:43.410 region:rollup2
HAVE MAYBE I COULD HAVE HAD SOME

01:44:41.609 --> 01:44:46.413 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT IMPACT ON HIS LIFE BUT

01:44:43.410 --> 01:44:48.482 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT --

01:44:46.413 --> 01:44:49.083 region:rollup2
IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE IS MOTHER

01:44:48.482 --> 01:44:50.518 region:rollup2
WAS GOING THROUGH A TOUGH TIME

01:44:49.083 --> 01:44:51.619 region:rollup2
IN AND THAT.

01:44:50.518 --> 01:44:52.586 region:rollup2
HIS FATHER WASN'T THERE IT WAS A

01:44:51.619 --> 01:44:54.221 region:rollup2
NEW MAN BEING INTRODUCED INTO

01:44:52.586 --> 01:44:55.156 region:rollup2
HIS LIFE AND SO FORTH AND SO I

01:44:54.221 --> 01:44:56.690 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW.

01:44:55.156 --> 01:44:58.259 region:rollup2
OTHER THAN MAINTAINING CONTACT

01:44:56.690 --> 01:44:59.727 region:rollup2
WITH HIM WHEN I COULD HAVE DONE

01:44:58.259 --> 01:45:00.895 region:rollup2
TO TO HAVE IMPACTED HIS LIFE.

01:44:59.727 --> 01:45:02.263 region:rollup2
MAYBE I COULD HAVE PUT HIM IN

01:45:00.895 --> 01:45:03.697 region:rollup2
TOUCH WITH SOME SORT OF

01:45:02.263 --> 01:45:05.166 region:rollup2
RESOURCES THAT TO WOULD HAVE

01:45:03.697 --> 01:45:06.901 region:rollup2

01:45:05.166 --> 01:45:08.602 region:rollup2
WITH THEM AND GOT HIM INTO SOME.

01:45:06.901 --> 01:45:10.437 region:rollup2
POSITION WHERE HE WOULD OF OF

01:45:08.602 --> 01:45:11.772 region:rollup2
SLIPPED INTO THE LIFE THEY

01:46:06.994 --> 01:46:10.698 region:rollup2
IN THERE THAT THAT TRYING THE

01:46:08.229 --> 01:46:12.433 region:rollup2
MOST WOULD BE THE LEAST LIKELY

01:46:10.698 --> 01:46:14.435 region:rollup2
TO DID TO BE INCLINED. TO TO GO

01:46:12.433 --> 01:46:15.035 region:rollup2
THROUGH THAT TRAINING AND SO YOU

01:46:14.435 --> 01:46:20.774 region:rollup2
KNOW IT IT JUST RAISES THE IN

01:46:15.035 --> 01:46:21.775 region:rollup2
THE PERENNIAL A CHALLENGE THAT

POLICED OR I IN AND I I THINK A

01:46:40.761 --> 01:46:44.832 region:rollup2
CERTAIN THE PARLOR.

01:46:42.529 --> 01:46:47.601 region:rollup2
THAT THE SOLUTION BUT I I THINK

01:46:44.832 --> 01:46:49.670 region:rollup2
IT IS HIGHLIGHTS THE THE L. THE

01:46:47.601 --> 01:46:49.970 region:rollup2
DIFFICULTY OF OF OF TRYING

01:46:49.670 --> 01:46:53.040 region:rollup2

01:46:49.970 --> 01:46:54.441 region:rollup2
TO ENACT IN CULTURE CHANGE AND

01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:56.844 region:rollup2
AND THAT IT'S SO ALONG AND AND

I KNOW THAT.

01:47:04.818 --> 01:47:08.555 region:rollup2
ONE YOU NO CULTURAL SIGNAL THAT

01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:11.258 region:rollup2
LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES RESPOND TO

01:47:08.555 --> 01:47:11.859 region:rollup2
IS INCREASE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.

01:47:11.258 --> 01:47:16.497 region:rollup2

--

01:47:16.497 --> 01:47:19.967 region:rollup2
FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT AS TO

01:47:18.265 --> 01:47:23.604 region:rollup2
WHETHER CURRENT PENALTIES FOR

01:47:19.967 --> 01:47:24.939 region:rollup2
HATE CRIMES WHETHER THEY'RE

01:47:23.604 --> 01:47:26.573 region:rollup2
CRIME ITSELF FOR ANY SENTENCING

01:47:24.939 --> 01:47:28.342 region:rollup2
ENHANCEMENTS.

01:47:26.573 --> 01:47:30.744 region:rollup2
ARE ADEQUATE IN ORDER.

01:47:28.342 --> 01:47:31.945 region:rollup2
TO YOU KNOW MAKE.

PROSECUTION OF HATE CRIMES.

01:47:33.847 --> 01:47:41.088 region:rollup2
A HIGH ENOUGH PRIORITY.

01:47:39.586 --> 01:47:42.656 region:rollup2
THE WITH THE WAY CALIFORNIA LAW

01:47:41.088 --> 01:47:44.224 region:rollup2
WORKS IS THAT --

01:47:42.656 --> 01:47:45.526 region:rollup2
THE PENALTY THAT EXISTS FOR THE

01:47:44.224 --> 01:47:47.094 region:rollup2
BIT THAT BASED CRIME WHETHER

01:47:45.526 --> 01:47:48.395 region:rollup2
IT'S AN ASSAULT WHETHER IT'S

01:47:47.094 --> 01:47:49.963 region:rollup2

01:47:51.865 --> 01:47:53.534 region:rollup2
AT ENHANCE GOING TO TALK ABOUT

01:47:53.367 --> 01:47:54.301 region:rollup2
SO.

01:47:53.534 --> 01:47:55.636 region:rollup2
I'M.

01:47:54.301 --> 01:47:57.171 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE IS MADE

01:47:55.636 --> 01:47:58.305 region:rollup2
POLICY DECISIONS ABOUT THOSE

01:47:57.171 --> 01:48:01.342 region:rollup2
PENALTIES FOR THE BASE CRIMES

01:47:58.305 --> 01:48:03.210 region:rollup2
AYE I THINK.

01:48:01.342 --> 01:48:04.645 region:rollup2
I I THINK THE KEY TO MAKING THIS

01:48:03.210 --> 01:48:06.046 region:rollup2
A PRIORITY FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:48:04.645 --> 01:48:07.715 region:rollup2
AGENCIES REALLY GOES BACK TO THE

01:48:06.046 --> 01:48:09.316 region:rollup2
TO THE LEADERSHIP.

01:48:07.715 --> 01:48:12.219 region:rollup2
ISSUE GOES BACK TO

01:48:09.316 --> 01:48:13.420 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY WE AND REQUIRED

01:48:12.219 --> 01:48:14.955 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S ADMINISTRATIVE WORK

01:48:13.420 --> 01:48:16.390 region:rollup2
OR OTHER WORK IS NOT DONE

01:48:14.955 --> 01:48:17.624 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATELY THAT THERE BE AN

01:48:16.390 --> 01:48:18.926 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY HOPE FOR THAT I

01:48:17.624 --> 01:48:21.829 region:rollup2
THINK --

01:48:18.926 --> 01:48:23.263 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WILL LIKELY PROVIDE --

01:48:21.829 --> 01:48:24.365 region:rollup2
MAY BE OF A MORE BENEFICIAL

01:48:23.263 --> 01:48:26.266 region:rollup2
PATHWAY [inaudible]

01:48:24.365 --> 01:48:27.101 region:rollup2
TO ENSURING THAT.

01:48:26.266 --> 01:48:29.770 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THESE CRIMES GET THE

01:48:27.101 --> 01:48:31.905 region:rollup2
ATTENTION THAT THAT THEY DESERVE

01:48:29.770 --> 01:48:33.140 region:rollup2
ON HERE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE. FOR

01:48:31.905 --> 01:48:35.275 region:rollup2
HOMICIDE FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE A

01:48:33.140 --> 01:48:36.643 region:rollup2
VERY LENGTHY PENALTIES AND WHAT

01:48:35.275 --> 01:48:40.481 region:rollup2
IF IT'S A HATE CRIME THERE ARE

01:48:36.643 --> 01:48:42.216 region:rollup2
ENHANCEMENTS ON TOP OF THAT --

01:48:40.481 --> 01:48:43.684 region:rollup2
THE KEY I THINK OR AT LEAST ONE

01:48:42.216 --> 01:48:44.685 region:rollup2
OF THE KEYS TO ENSURING PROPER

01:48:43.684 --> 01:48:45.719 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZATION.

01:48:44.685 --> 01:48:46.887 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY IN OUR LAW

01:48:45.719 --> 01:48:48.088 region:rollup2

MAYBE THEY'LL CHANGE.

01:53:22.229 --> 01:53:25.766 region:rollup2

THANK YOU.

01:53:37.177 --> 01:53:41.348 region:rollup2
THE YET BUT THE PROFESSOR THAT

01:53:38.679 --> 01:53:45.185 region:rollup2
SPOKE EARLIER TODAY TALKED ABOUT

01:53:41.348 --> 01:53:47.721 region:rollup2
THE USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA. TO TO

01:53:45.185 --> 01:53:49.756 region:rollup2
TO PUSH OUT --

01:53:47.721 --> 01:53:52.793 region:rollup2
RACIST MESSAGES.

01:53:49.756 --> 01:53:54.027 region:rollup2
AND IF THERE'S A WEAK POINT IN.

01:53:52.793 --> 01:53:55.262 region:rollup2
CULTURES ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE

01:53:54.027 --> 01:53:58.031 region:rollup2
WORLD AND IN INCLUDING OUR

01:53:55.262 --> 01:53:59.633 region:rollup2
COUNTRY IT'S IT'S RACISM.

01:53:58.031 --> 01:54:00.801 region:rollup2
THAT -- IF

01:53:59.633 --> 01:54:02.369 region:rollup2
FIVE WE WERE A QUILT.

01:54:00.801 --> 01:54:03.737 region:rollup2
AND THERE IS A THREAD AND NEED

01:54:02.369 --> 01:54:05.272 region:rollup2
IS COUPLED ON THAT RACES THREAD

01:54:03.737 --> 01:54:05.772 region:rollup2
AND IT WOULD UNRAVEL THE ENTIRE

01:54:05.272 --> 01:54:07.874 region:rollup2
QUILT.

01:54:05.772 --> 01:54:11.778 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S PRETTY

01:54:07.874 --> 01:54:13.580 region:rollup2
SMART OF OUR ENEMIES WHETHER

01:54:11.778 --> 01:54:15.215 region:rollup2
IT'S RUSSIA WHERE PEOPLE JUST

01:54:13.580 --> 01:54:15.515 region:rollup2

01:54:18.819 --> 01:54:22.389 region:rollup2
WHAT TUG OR TALK ABOUT CODEINE

01:54:20.754 --> 01:54:23.957 region:rollup2

01:54:23.957 --> 01:54:28.328 region:rollup2
WHAT THOSE TRENDS ARE?

01:54:25.792 --> 01:54:30.030 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH ARE WE TRACKING WHETHER

01:54:28.328 --> 01:54:31.598 region:rollup2
OR NOT?

01:54:30.030 --> 01:54:33.767 region:rollup2
SOME OF THIS IS MOTIVATED BY

01:54:31.598 --> 01:54:35.502 region:rollup2
MESSAGES THAT PEOPLE HAVE PICKED

01:54:33.767 --> 01:54:36.737 region:rollup2
UP ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND ISN'T SO

01:54:35.502 --> 01:54:37.637 region:rollup2
MUCH RACISM BUT THERE'S A VERY

01:54:36.737 --> 01:54:40.540 region:rollup2
FAMOUS --

WASHINGTON DC THAT ACTUALLY.

01:54:45.579 --> 01:54:49.349 region:rollup2
RESULTED IN SOMEONE GOING TO THE

01:54:47.514 --> 01:54:51.351 region:rollup2

01:54:49.349 --> 01:54:53.086 region:rollup2
WHO BELIEVED THAT THAT WAS

01:54:51.351 --> 01:54:55.555 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY TAKING PLACE THERE?

01:54:53.086 --> 01:55:01.828 region:rollup2
AND KNOW HOW MUCH OF THAT TYPE

01:54:55.555 --> 01:55:03.964 region:rollup2
OF DATA ARE WE TRACKING.

01:55:01.828 --> 01:55:05.399 region:rollup2
THERE IS NOT AN OFFICIAL

01:55:03.964 --> 01:55:06.500 region:rollup2
REPORTING IN THAT DEATH BAKED IN

01:55:05.399 --> 01:55:07.868 region:rollup2
OUR PART OF THE MANDATORY

REPORTING FOR OUR ANNUAL.

01:55:07.868 --> 01:55:11.204 region:rollup2
HATE CRIMES REPORT YOU KNOW AS

01:55:09.736 --> 01:55:13.473 region:rollup2
MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE LIVING

01:55:13.473 --> 01:55:15.776 region:rollup2
SECRET LIVES ONLINE.

01:55:14.608 --> 01:55:17.210 region:rollup2
ON YEAH I THINK IT'S

01:55:15.776 --> 01:55:19.413 region:rollup2
INCREASINGLY SOMETHING THAT CAN

01:55:17.210 --> 01:55:21.047 region:rollup2
COME INTO PLAY IN TERMS OF AN

01:55:19.413 --> 01:55:22.282 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL LAW ENFORCEMENT'S

01:55:21.047 --> 01:55:24.317 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION OF PARTICULAR

01:55:22.282 --> 01:55:25.652 region:rollup2
ACTION AND MAY PROVIDE.

01:55:24.317 --> 01:55:27.621 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE --

01:55:25.652 --> 01:55:28.955 region:rollup2
IN TO INTENT OR MOTIVE --

01:55:27.621 --> 01:55:29.823 region:rollup2
WHICH YOU HEARD ABOUT EARLIER IN

01:55:28.955 --> 01:55:31.358 region:rollup2
TERMS OF THE DIFFICULTY OF

01:55:29.823 --> 01:55:32.225 region:rollup2
PROSECUTING THESE CRIMES BUT

01:55:31.358 --> 01:55:33.593 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT.

01:55:32.225 --> 01:55:35.562 region:rollup2
THE DOJ THAT IS CURRENTLY PART

01:55:33.593 --> 01:55:36.062 region:rollup2
OF ANY OF THE MANDATED REPORTING

01:55:35.562 --> 01:55:37.164 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:55:36.062 --> 01:55:38.632 region:rollup2
THAT WE RECEIVE OFTEN

01:55:37.164 --> 01:55:40.133 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE MY LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:55:38.632 --> 01:55:41.568 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING

01:55:40.133 --> 01:55:43.537 region:rollup2
ELSE TO ADD IN TERMS OF THAT

SOCIAL MEDIA TRACKING OR

INFORMATION IN PARTICULAR.

01:55:46.072 --> 01:55:50.177 region:rollup2
SO IT'S NOT MANDATED.

01:55:48.108 --> 01:55:51.311 region:rollup2
AND PERHAPS IT'S NEW THE USE OF

01:55:50.177 --> 01:55:54.915 region:rollup2
IT TO INCITE [inaudible]

01:55:51.311 --> 01:55:55.415 region:rollup2
HE IT IS SOMETHING THAT PERHAPS

01:55:54.915 --> 01:55:57.083 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD BE PAYING MORE

01:55:55.415 --> 01:55:59.186 region:rollup2
ATTENTION.

01:55:57.083 --> 01:56:00.020 region:rollup2
TO AND AYE ANDERSON IS DIFFICULT

01:55:59.186 --> 01:56:01.488 region:rollup2

DIFFERENT THINGS IT GOT ATTRACT

01:56:01.488 --> 01:56:03.723 region:rollup2
BUT IS THE SOME OF THE

01:56:02.556 --> 01:56:05.892 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE NEEDS.

01:56:03.723 --> 01:56:07.360 region:rollup2
TO GET INVOLVED OR FOR YOU TO

01:56:05.892 --> 01:56:09.262 region:rollup2
TAKE COME TO US AND SAY THIS IS

01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:09.729 region:rollup2

PARTICULAR.

01:56:14.267 --> 01:56:17.938 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S CERTAINLY A

01:56:15.035 --> 01:56:18.972 region:rollup2
QUESTION WORTH ASKING AND IT'S

01:56:17.938 --> 01:56:20.607 region:rollup2
AND AS I SAID M..

01:56:18.972 --> 01:56:22.709 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY'RE WHEN THE EVIDENCE

01:56:20.607 --> 01:56:23.310 region:rollup2
IN A PARTICULAR CASE LEADS IN

01:56:22.709 --> 01:56:24.411 region:rollup2
THAT DIRECTION IT'S CERTAINLY

01:56:23.310 --> 01:56:25.479 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT IS?

01:56:24.411 --> 01:56:29.082 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED TO BE YOU KNOW FOR

01:56:25.479 --> 01:56:31.318 region:rollup2

YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THE RUBBER

01:56:40.160 --> 01:56:43.730 region:rollup2
HITS THE ROAD BUT I THINK THAT.

01:56:42.329 --> 01:56:45.398 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY CAN BE RELEVANT

01:56:43.730 --> 01:56:48.768 region:rollup2
CERTAIN PLACES AND CAN --

01:56:45.398 --> 01:56:50.503 region:rollup2

HELPFUL BUT I THINK IT'S

01:56:59.279 --> 01:57:06.987 region:rollup2

WORSE MANY INCIDENTS ARE NOT

02:02:45.325 --> 02:02:48.294 region:rollup2
EVEN REPORTED BECAUSE MEMBERS OF

THESE COMMUNITIES OFTEN FEEL

02:02:48.294 --> 02:02:51.197 region:rollup2
UNSAFE INTERACTING WITH LAW

02:02:49.729 --> 02:02:53.132 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS AND FEAR

02:02:51.197 --> 02:02:54.734 region:rollup2
BEING IGNORED OR EVEN TARGETED

BY THE BUREAU OF JUSTICE

02:02:58.371 --> 02:03:01.341 region:rollup2
STATISTICS WHICH I THINK WAS

02:02:59.873 --> 02:03:02.976 region:rollup2
MENTIONED EARLIER OVER HALF OF

02:03:01.341 --> 02:03:05.478 region:rollup2

02:03:02.976 --> 02:03:06.779 region:rollup2
UNREPORTED. TO SPEAK

02:03:05.478 --> 02:03:08.781 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY TO HATE CRIMES AND

02:03:06.779 --> 02:03:09.716 region:rollup2
THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY FOR A MOMENT

02:03:08.781 --> 02:03:11.317 region:rollup2
HATE CRIMES WITH A SEXUAL

02:03:09.716 --> 02:03:12.752 region:rollup2
ORIENTATION BIAS HAVE

02:03:11.317 --> 02:03:13.853 region:rollup2
CONSISTENTLY BEEN THE SECOND

02:03:12.752 --> 02:03:15.889 region:rollup2
MOST COMMON TYPE OF HATE CRIME

02:03:13.853 --> 02:03:17.390 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA. FOR MORE THAN TEN

02:03:15.889 --> 02:03:18.458 region:rollup2
YEARS AND ACCOUNTED FOR NEARLY A

02:03:17.390 --> 02:03:20.526 region:rollup2
QUARTER OF ALL HATE CRIMES

02:03:18.458 --> 02:03:22.395 region:rollup2
REPORTED IN CALIFORNIA OVER EACH

CRIMES OF THE BIAS AGAINST GAY

02:03:24.197 --> 02:03:29.002 region:rollup2
MEN IN PARTICULAR INCREASE OVER

02:03:26.366 --> 02:03:29.903 region:rollup2
40% BETWEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND

02:03:29.002 --> 02:03:32.305 region:rollup2
TWENTY SIXTEEN AND THEN INCREASE

02:03:29.903 --> 02:03:34.440 region:rollup2
AN ADDITIONAL 13% BETWEEN TWENTY

02:03:32.305 --> 02:03:35.508 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN

02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:36.943 region:rollup2
HATE CRIMES AGAINST TRANSGENDER

02:03:35.508 --> 02:03:38.278 region:rollup2
AND GENDER NON CONFORMING PEOPLE

02:03:36.943 --> 02:03:39.846 region:rollup2
HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR A SIGNIFICANT

02:03:38.278 --> 02:03:41.180 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE OF HATE CRIMES.

02:03:39.846 --> 02:03:42.749 region:rollup2
BASED ON GENDER IN CALIFORNIA

02:03:41.180 --> 02:03:44.484 region:rollup2
CONSISTENTLY SINCE THAT DATA HAS

02:03:42.749 --> 02:03:46.419 region:rollup2
BECOME AVAILABLE FOR EXAMPLE

02:03:44.484 --> 02:03:48.154 region:rollup2
OVER 90% OF THE HATE CRIMES

02:03:46.419 --> 02:03:48.788 region:rollup2
BASED ON GENDER IN TWENTY

02:03:48.154 --> 02:03:49.656 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN WE'RE COMMITTED AGAINST

CONFORMING PEOPLE.

02:03:51.524 --> 02:03:54.327 region:rollup2
OF COURSE THIS INFORMATION IS

02:03:52.926 --> 02:03:55.028 region:rollup2
BASED ONLY ON THE CRIMES THAT

02:03:54.327 --> 02:03:56.896 region:rollup2
ARE BOTH REPORTED TO LAW

02:03:55.028 --> 02:03:57.764 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT AND IDENTIFIED AS

02:03:56.896 --> 02:03:58.965 region:rollup2
HATE CRIMES.

02:03:57.764 --> 02:04:00.566 region:rollup2
THE AUDIT REPORT POINTED OUT

02:03:58.965 --> 02:04:02.368 region:rollup2
ACCURATE IDENTIFICATION OF HATE

02:04:00.566 --> 02:04:03.970 region:rollup2

02:04:02.368 --> 02:04:05.238 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR STATE LAWS

02:04:03.970 --> 02:04:06.839 region:rollup2
SO THE OVERALL RATES OF HATE

02:04:05.238 --> 02:04:08.474 region:rollup2
CRIMES IN THE NUMBER SPECIFIC TO

02:04:06.839 --> 02:04:09.776 region:rollup2
THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY.

02:04:08.474 --> 02:04:11.744 region:rollup2
ARE MOST LIKELY EVEN HIGHER THAN

02:04:09.776 --> 02:04:13.112 region:rollup2
THESE REPORTS REFLECT.

02:04:11.744 --> 02:04:14.847 region:rollup2
HATE CRIMES AND HATE VIOLENCE

02:04:13.112 --> 02:04:16.349 region:rollup2
HAVE UNIQUE REPERCUSSIONS

02:04:14.847 --> 02:04:17.650 region:rollup2
EXTENDING BEYOND THE INDIVIDUALS

02:04:16.349 --> 02:04:18.751 region:rollup2
TARGETED TO OTHERS IN THE

02:04:17.650 --> 02:04:20.320 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES OF WHICH THESE

02:04:18.751 --> 02:04:22.422 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS ARE APART.

02:04:20.320 --> 02:04:24.223 region:rollup2
CREATING A SENSE OF ISOLATION

02:04:22.422 --> 02:04:25.024 region:rollup2
AND VULNERABILITY TO HARM AMONG

02:04:24.223 --> 02:04:27.026 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WITH SHARED CORE

02:04:25.024 --> 02:04:28.528 region:rollup2
CHARACTERISTICS.

02:04:27.026 --> 02:04:29.896 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S HATE CRIME LAWS FOR

02:04:28.528 --> 02:04:31.097 region:rollup2

AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED BEFORE IN

02:04:40.573 --> 02:04:43.209 region:rollup2
ADDITION TO PROVIDING LEGAL

HATE CRIMES ENUMERATING EACH OF

THESE GROUPS ALSO HELPS TO RAISE

02:04:46.980 --> 02:04:49.415 region:rollup2
AWARENESS OF THE IMPACT OF HATE

02:04:48.681 --> 02:04:50.883 region:rollup2

MORE THAN ONE MARGINALIZED

02:04:53.553 --> 02:04:57.824 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY. FOR EXAMPLE LGBTQ

02:04:56.255 --> 02:04:59.025 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO ARE ALSO OF COLOR

02:04:57.824 --> 02:05:00.727 region:rollup2
FACE HIGHER RISKS OF

02:04:59.025 --> 02:05:02.829 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCING HATE VIOLENCE.

02:05:00.727 --> 02:05:04.230 region:rollup2
IS A MIXED IS TRUE OF LGBTQ

02:05:02.829 --> 02:05:05.965 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO ARE ALSO IMMIGRANTS

WHO ALSO HAVE DISABILITIES.

02:05:05.965 --> 02:05:08.468 region:rollup2
AND CONSIDERING HOW WE ADDRESS

02:05:10.236 --> 02:05:13.339 region:rollup2
TO LOOK CLOSELY.

02:05:12.071 --> 02:05:14.273 region:rollup2
HAD THE EXPERIENCES OF PEOPLE

02:05:14.273 --> 02:05:17.076 region:rollup2
MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES AND

02:05:15.942 --> 02:05:18.878 region:rollup2
LISTEN TO THEIR STORIES AND

02:05:18.878 --> 02:05:22.115 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING

US SORT OFTENTIMES HAPPENS IN

02:11:37.022 --> 02:11:42.061 region:rollup2
OUR COMMUNITY IS THAT --

02:11:39.391 --> 02:11:43.362 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE SEEN AT ON

02:11:42.061 --> 02:11:45.598 region:rollup2
THE GROUND IS EITHER THE

02:11:43.362 --> 02:11:47.066 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY HAS A LANGUAGE BARRIER

02:11:45.598 --> 02:11:48.968 region:rollup2
OR THERE'S JUST A LACK OF TRUST

02:11:47.066 --> 02:11:50.202 region:rollup2
AT THE LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTUALLY

02:11:48.968 --> 02:11:51.771 region:rollup2

02:11:50.202 --> 02:11:53.506 region:rollup2
THROUGH WITH THE CASE

02:11:51.771 --> 02:11:55.975 region:rollup2
THEY USUALLY CALL ORGANIZATION

02:11:53.506 --> 02:11:57.910 region:rollup2
FIRST AND WE USUALLY YOU KNOW I

02:11:55.975 --> 02:11:59.211 region:rollup2

TAKING EVIDENCE IN CONCERT

02:12:04.383 --> 02:12:08.053 region:rollup2
TALKING TO THE FOLKS AND I JUST

02:12:06.485 --> 02:12:09.688 region:rollup2
TO HIGHLIGHT AN EXAMPLE OF THAT

02:12:08.053 --> 02:12:11.657 region:rollup2
SO -- LAST

02:12:09.688 --> 02:12:13.859 region:rollup2
YEAR THE DAVIS MOSQUE JUST RIGHT

02:12:11.657 --> 02:12:14.460 region:rollup2
DOWN THE STREET --

02:12:13.859 --> 02:12:17.396 region:rollup2
IT WAS VANDALIZE A WINDOWS ARE

02:12:14.460 --> 02:12:19.999 region:rollup2
BROUGHT.

02:12:17.396 --> 02:12:21.167 region:rollup2
THE DOOR AND ONE INTERESTING

02:12:19.999 --> 02:12:23.035 region:rollup2
THING ABOUT THE INCIDENT THE

02:12:21.167 --> 02:12:24.870 region:rollup2
MOMENT WE HEARD ABOUT IT.

02:12:23.035 --> 02:12:27.606 region:rollup2
WE WERE AT FIRST WE JUST HEARD

02:12:24.870 --> 02:12:28.941 region:rollup2
OF THE VANDALISM SO WE WERE. ONE

02:12:27.606 --> 02:12:31.110 region:rollup2
WE NEED FOR US WE KNEW WAS A

02:12:28.941 --> 02:12:32.378 region:rollup2
HATE INCIDENT HOWEVER THE MOMENT

02:12:31.110 --> 02:12:33.646 region:rollup2
WE FOUND OUT IT WAS BE THERE IS

02:12:32.378 --> 02:12:36.081 region:rollup2
BEACON RAPPED ON THE DOOR WE

02:12:33.646 --> 02:12:37.383 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAD A SIGH OF RELIEF.

02:12:36.081 --> 02:12:40.085 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OFTENTIMES WHAT WE GET

02:12:37.383 --> 02:12:42.254 region:rollup2
IS IF IT APPEARS JUST TO BE MERE

02:12:40.085 --> 02:12:45.357 region:rollup2
VANDALISM OR SO ON INDIVIDUAL IS

02:12:42.254 --> 02:12:47.493 region:rollup2
ASSAULTED OR ATTACKED IT WILL BE

02:12:45.357 --> 02:12:48.994 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED JUST A OF A CRIME IT

02:12:47.493 --> 02:12:50.563 region:rollup2
WILL IT WILL BE CONSIDERED A

02:12:48.994 --> 02:12:51.664 region:rollup2
HATE CRIME SPECIFICALLY.

02:12:50.563 --> 02:12:52.798 region:rollup2
SO THE MOMENT WE FOUND OUT THAT

02:12:51.664 --> 02:12:54.567 region:rollup2
THERE IS BIG AND WE WERE

02:12:52.798 --> 02:12:56.368 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY REALLY HAPPY.

02:12:54.567 --> 02:12:58.604 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE ASK OURSELVES.

02:12:56.368 --> 02:13:00.539 region:rollup2
IS IT PORK WEEKEND BECAUSE FOR

02:12:58.604 --> 02:13:02.274 region:rollup2

02:13:00.539 --> 02:13:04.643 region:rollup2
THOSE THINGS WHERE.

02:13:02.274 --> 02:13:06.245 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH IF IT SEEMS LIKE IT NOT

02:13:04.643 --> 02:13:07.813 region:rollup2
THAT BIG OF A DEAL FOR US THAT

02:13:06.245 --> 02:13:09.949 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO PROVE.

02:13:07.813 --> 02:13:11.684 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S A HATE INCIDENT FOR

02:13:09.949 --> 02:13:12.284 region:rollup2
FOR A FOR THAT TO HAPPEN IN

02:13:11.684 --> 02:13:14.486 region:rollup2
THANKFULLY I'M NOT THANKFULLY

02:13:12.284 --> 02:13:15.621 region:rollup2
BUT THANKFULLY THAT THERE WAS

02:13:14.486 --> 02:13:17.156 region:rollup2
ENOUGH EVIDENCE FOR THE POLICE

02:13:15.621 --> 02:13:19.191 region:rollup2
TO CONTINUE PROSECUTING BUT

02:13:17.156 --> 02:13:19.859 region:rollup2
OFTENTIMES O. IN WHAT HAPPENED

02:13:19.191 --> 02:13:21.660 region:rollup2

DOOR OF THE GATES AND LIKE

02:13:27.900 --> 02:13:31.070 region:rollup2
DESTROYED COMPLETELY.

02:13:29.568 --> 02:13:33.639 region:rollup2
NUMBER BECAUSE THERE IS NO OTHER

02:13:31.070 --> 02:13:35.374 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE BUT LAKE VANDALISM.

02:13:33.639 --> 02:13:36.475 region:rollup2
IT WAS JUST SEEN AS A BASIC

02:13:35.374 --> 02:13:38.344 region:rollup2
VANDALISM.

02:13:36.475 --> 02:13:39.178 region:rollup2
SO THE COMMUNION MEMBERS ARE

02:13:38.344 --> 02:13:39.945 region:rollup2
LIKE HAVE BEEN SCARED AND JUST

02:13:39.178 --> 02:13:42.181 region:rollup2
WITH.

02:13:39.945 --> 02:13:43.749 region:rollup2
THE INCREASE OF ATTACKS TOWARDS

02:13:42.181 --> 02:13:45.551 region:rollup2
THE HOUSES OF WORSHIP WE'VE

02:13:43.749 --> 02:13:46.085 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAD TO CONDUCT --

02:13:45.551 --> 02:13:49.221 region:rollup2
SAFETY TRAININGS AN ACTIVE

02:13:46.085 --> 02:13:50.923 region:rollup2
SHOOTER TIONS AND FOR US THAT

02:13:49.221 --> 02:13:52.024 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT A SOLUTION WERE

02:13:50.923 --> 02:13:53.425 region:rollup2
THANKFUL THAT THE LAW

02:13:52.024 --> 02:13:54.927 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT HAVE STEPPED UP.

02:13:53.425 --> 02:13:56.328 region:rollup2
HAVE ACTUALLY DONE --

02:13:54.927 --> 02:13:57.997 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT THE HOUSE OF WORSHIP

02:13:56.328 --> 02:13:59.498 region:rollup2
CHO DO SAFETY --

02:13:57.997 --> 02:14:00.799 region:rollup2
SAFETY CHECK AND KIND OF GIVE

02:13:59.498 --> 02:14:03.903 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO

02:14:00.799 --> 02:14:05.137 region:rollup2
IMPROVE JUST THE INNER WORKINGS

02:14:03.903 --> 02:14:06.338 region:rollup2
OF OUR MOSQUE JUST TO MAKE SURE

02:14:05.137 --> 02:14:07.740 region:rollup2
WE HAVE ENOUGH SAFETY EXITS BUT

02:14:06.338 --> 02:14:09.008 region:rollup2
FOR US ON A SOLUTION THAT'S

02:14:07.740 --> 02:14:11.076 region:rollup2
MERELY JUST.

02:14:09.008 --> 02:14:15.014 region:rollup2
PREPARATION FOR THE WORST CASE

02:14:11.076 --> 02:14:16.715 region:rollup2
SCENARIO AND FOR JUST LOOKING AT

02:14:15.014 --> 02:14:19.318 region:rollup2
OUR SCHOOL SPECIFICALLY.

02:14:16.715 --> 02:14:21.387 region:rollup2
AND SO THE SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW

02:14:19.318 --> 02:14:22.421 region:rollup2
CENTER ACTUALLY REPORTED NINE

02:14:21.387 --> 02:14:25.424 region:rollup2
HUNDRED INCIDENTS WITHIN THE TEN

02:14:22.421 --> 02:14:26.759 region:rollup2
DAYS FOLLOWING THE TWO THOUSAND

02:14:25.424 --> 02:14:27.293 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN ELECTIONS A MAJORITY OF

02:14:26.759 --> 02:14:28.594 region:rollup2
THOSE ACTUALLY OCCURRED IN

02:14:27.293 --> 02:14:30.296 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS.

02:14:28.594 --> 02:14:31.897 region:rollup2
SO FOR THE MUSCLE COMMUNITY

02:14:30.296 --> 02:14:33.699 region:rollup2
ABOUT 53% OF STUDENTS ARE

02:14:31.897 --> 02:14:35.434 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY BELIEVED.

02:14:33.699 --> 02:14:37.836 region:rollup2
AND IN TERMS OF THOSE THE

02:14:35.434 --> 02:14:38.938 region:rollup2
SISTERS THAT CHOOSE TO WEAR THE

02:14:37.836 --> 02:14:40.439 region:rollup2
HEAD RELIGIOUS HEADSCARF.

02:14:38.938 --> 02:14:42.007 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY THIRTY SIX OF THEM HAVE

02:14:40.439 --> 02:14:43.208 region:rollup2
EITHER RECEIVE VERY OFFENSIVE

02:14:42.007 --> 02:14:44.843 region:rollup2
TOUCHING PULLING OR HAVE BEEN

02:14:43.208 --> 02:14:46.445 region:rollup2
ATTACKS.

02:14:44.843 --> 02:14:48.347 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY THE NUMBERS THAT

02:14:46.445 --> 02:14:49.515 region:rollup2
WE HAVE RECEIVED --

02:14:48.347 --> 02:14:50.182 region:rollup2
OVER THE YEARS BECAUSE WE'VE

02:14:49.515 --> 02:14:53.852 region:rollup2
BEEN TRACKING IT THERE A BOWLING

02:14:50.182 --> 02:14:55.220 region:rollup2
OR POOR IS IN 200014402% OF THE

02:14:53.852 --> 02:14:57.089 region:rollup2
RESPONDENTS.

02:14:55.220 --> 02:14:58.657 region:rollup2
OF THE STUDENTS IN THIS IS A OF

02:14:57.089 --> 02:15:00.159 region:rollup2
SURVEY TAKEN ACROSS THE STATE OF

02:14:58.657 --> 02:15:01.961 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA --

02:15:00.159 --> 02:15:03.295 region:rollup2
FROM PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PA ON

02:15:01.961 --> 02:15:05.030 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS --

02:15:03.295 --> 02:15:07.533 region:rollup2
FELT THAT AN ADULT [inaudible]

02:15:05.030 --> 02:15:09.234 region:rollup2
LEARN THE SITUATION AS IT WAS

02:15:07.533 --> 02:15:11.136 region:rollup2
ALL BY AN ADULT BUT ONLY THIS

02:15:09.234 --> 02:15:11.904 region:rollup2
YEAR INTO THE ARMED TO ON

02:15:11.136 --> 02:15:13.072 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN OUR MOST RECENT REPORT

02:15:11.904 --> 02:15:13.706 region:rollup2
32%.

02:15:13.072 --> 02:15:15.441 region:rollup2
SO NUMBERS ARE ACTUALLY GETTING

02:15:13.706 --> 02:15:15.975 region:rollup2
WORSE -- AND

02:15:15.441 --> 02:15:18.544 region:rollup2
THE STUDENTS ARE ACTUALLY

02:15:15.975 --> 02:15:19.645 region:rollup2
REPORTING TO US DIRECTLY AND IN

02:15:18.544 --> 02:15:20.746 region:rollup2
SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT HAVE

02:15:19.645 --> 02:15:21.714 region:rollup2
NO REPORTS WHATSOEVER OF

02:15:20.746 --> 02:15:23.716 region:rollup2
BULLYING OR HATE INCIDENTS

02:15:21.714 --> 02:15:25.751 region:rollup2
TOWARDS MUSLIM STUDENTS BUT WE

02:15:23.716 --> 02:15:27.853 region:rollup2
HAVE THEM IN OUR REPORT. TO SHOW

02:15:25.751 --> 02:15:29.521 region:rollup2
IN TO TALK TO THE DISTRICT AND

02:15:27.853 --> 02:15:31.023 region:rollup2
THIS IS A VERY --

02:15:29.521 --> 02:15:34.026 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT ISSUE.

02:15:31.023 --> 02:15:35.761 region:rollup2
LIKE FOR US BUT ALSO --

02:15:34.026 --> 02:15:36.795 region:rollup2
JUST ONE ONE AND TO NOTE AND

02:15:35.761 --> 02:15:38.530 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHT --

02:15:36.795 --> 02:15:39.131 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WAS SAID EARLIER.

02:15:38.530 --> 02:15:42.067 region:rollup2
BUT THE SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW

02:15:39.131 --> 02:15:44.870 region:rollup2
CENTER REPORT MOST ON HATE

02:15:42.067 --> 02:15:46.872 region:rollup2
GROUPS HAVE INCREASED BY 197%.

02:15:44.870 --> 02:15:48.273 region:rollup2
BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN

02:15:46.872 --> 02:15:49.608 region:rollup2
INTO THE SIXTEEN THIS IS AN

02:15:48.273 --> 02:15:50.743 region:rollup2
ISSUE THAT --

02:15:49.608 --> 02:15:52.611 region:rollup2
IS GETTING WORSE AND WE REALLY

02:15:50.743 --> 02:15:53.746 region:rollup2
NEED -- AND

02:15:52.611 --> 02:15:54.613 region:rollup2
WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE AUDIT

02:15:53.746 --> 02:15:55.648 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT GIVES US AN

02:15:54.613 --> 02:15:57.950 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE FORWARD AND

02:15:55.648 --> 02:15:59.485 region:rollup2
JUSTICE ISSUE A FEW THINGS THAT

02:15:57.950 --> 02:16:02.087 region:rollup2
WE RECOMMEND THROUGH.

02:15:59.485 --> 02:16:03.422 region:rollup2
THROUGH CARE THAT WOULD ALLOW US

02:16:02.087 --> 02:16:05.357 region:rollup2
TO FINALLY START TACKLING THESE

02:16:03.422 --> 02:16:07.126 region:rollup2
ISSUES IS REALLY JUST HAVING

02:16:05.357 --> 02:16:10.062 region:rollup2
IMPLICIT BIAS TRAININGS WITHIN

02:16:07.126 --> 02:16:10.863 region:rollup2
THE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES

02:16:10.062 --> 02:16:11.997 region:rollup2
IN RECOGNIZING A BECAUSE

02:16:10.863 --> 02:16:13.499 region:rollup2
OFTENTIMES WHAT WE'VE SEEN.

02:16:11.997 --> 02:16:14.733 region:rollup2

REPORTED LAW ENFORCEMENT AND

02:21:50.836 --> 02:21:54.306 region:rollup2
WHEN REPORTED OFFICERS ALMOST

02:21:52.637 --> 02:21:54.906 region:rollup2

02:22:24.169 --> 02:22:26.104 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE

02:22:25.237 --> 02:22:28.073 region:rollup2
SUBJECT OF VIOLENT CRIME AT

02:22:26.104 --> 02:22:29.074 region:rollup2
ABOUT TWICE.

02:22:28.073 --> 02:22:33.011 region:rollup2

ABOUT FOUR TIMES GENERATE.

02:22:37.616 --> 02:22:40.018 region:rollup2

02:22:38.150 --> 02:22:41.653 region:rollup2

THEIR TWO MAJOR CATEGORIES AB

02:22:45.057 --> 02:22:49.261 region:rollup2
MOTIVATIONS FOR THE SCRAPS. ONE

02:22:47.726 --> 02:22:50.595 region:rollup2
CATEGORY IS THE PERCEPTION OF

02:22:49.261 --> 02:22:52.497 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THOSE WITH DISABILITIES

02:22:50.595 --> 02:22:54.099 region:rollup2
ARE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE.

02:22:52.497 --> 02:22:56.334 region:rollup2
THIS MAY THEY THESE MAY OR MAY

02:22:54.099 --> 02:22:56.902 region:rollup2
NOT BE HATE CRIMES DEPENDING ON

02:22:56.334 --> 02:22:59.070 region:rollup2
THE FACTS OF EACH INDIVIDUAL

02:22:56.902 --> 02:23:01.139 region:rollup2
CASE [inaudible]

02:22:59.070 --> 02:23:03.041 region:rollup2
OTHER CATEGORY.

02:23:01.139 --> 02:23:03.341 region:rollup2
A MOTIVATION IS PURE BY US

02:23:03.041 --> 02:23:05.143 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

02:23:03.341 --> 02:23:06.545 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY.

02:23:05.143 --> 02:23:08.380 region:rollup2
HOSTILITY TO PERSONS WHO ROWS

02:23:06.545 --> 02:23:10.148 region:rollup2
FEAR OR GUILT.

02:23:08.380 --> 02:23:10.949 region:rollup2
FEAR OF PERSONS WHOSE VISIBLE

02:23:10.148 --> 02:23:12.317 region:rollup2
TRAITS MAY BE DISTURBING TO

02:23:10.949 --> 02:23:13.752 region:rollup2
OTHERS.

02:23:12.317 --> 02:23:15.854 region:rollup2
RESENTMENT OF THOSE WHO NEED

02:23:13.752 --> 02:23:16.254 region:rollup2
RECEIVE HER AND INCREASINGLY

02:23:15.854 --> 02:23:17.556 region:rollup2
DEMAND ALTERNATIVE

02:23:16.254 --> 02:23:19.858 region:rollup2
ACCOMMODATIONS.

02:23:17.556 --> 02:23:21.426 region:rollup2
OR A PERCEPTION THAT PEOPLE WITH

02:23:19.858 --> 02:23:24.229 region:rollup2
DISABILITIES ARE INFERIOR.

02:23:21.426 --> 02:23:26.331 region:rollup2
AND THEREFORE DESERVING VICTIMS.

02:23:24.229 --> 02:23:28.967 region:rollup2
THESE ARE HATE CRIMES EVERYONE

02:23:26.331 --> 02:23:30.669 region:rollup2
OF THOSE DESCRIBED AS ACRE.

02:23:28.967 --> 02:23:31.703 region:rollup2
I KNOW THAT IN THE UK CASE THE

02:23:30.669 --> 02:23:33.772 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL ACTION EVEN WITHOUT ANY

02:23:31.703 --> 02:23:35.607 region:rollup2
OTHER EVIDENCE.

02:23:33.772 --> 02:23:36.675 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE BEEN STRONG EVIDENCE

02:23:35.607 --> 02:23:39.111 region:rollup2
IN COURT THAT THE SIENESE WERE

02:23:36.675 --> 02:23:40.879 region:rollup2
MOTIVATED BY THE LAST OF THOSE

02:23:39.111 --> 02:23:42.247 region:rollup2
THAT LIST OF ABUSES TREATIES

02:23:40.879 --> 02:23:43.548 region:rollup2
WOMEN'S AS WITH DISABILITIES AS

02:23:42.247 --> 02:23:46.218 region:rollup2
INFERIOR.

02:23:43.548 --> 02:23:48.954 region:rollup2
ALMOST SUB HUMAN. TO BE USED AS

02:23:46.218 --> 02:23:50.856 region:rollup2
OBJECTS AS FAIR GAME. TO GET

02:23:48.954 --> 02:23:51.323 region:rollup2
EVEN WITH THEIR DAY CHEF WHAT

02:23:50.856 --> 02:23:53.492 region:rollup2
WITH ARAB NIGHT SHIFT

02:23:51.323 --> 02:23:54.459 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES.

02:23:53.492 --> 02:23:56.394 region:rollup2
IF IF THE POLICE HAD

02:23:54.459 --> 02:23:57.062 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATED FURTHER THEY MAY OR

02:23:56.394 --> 02:23:58.430 region:rollup2
MAY NOT HAVE FOUND FURTHER

02:23:57.062 --> 02:23:59.631 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE OF BIAS BUT EVEN

02:23:58.430 --> 02:24:02.434 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THAT.

02:23:59.631 --> 02:24:03.568 region:rollup2
THE THERE WAS A THERE MAY VERY

02:24:02.434 --> 02:24:06.371 region:rollup2
WELL HAVE BEEN ENOUGH EVIDENCE

02:24:03.568 --> 02:24:07.772 region:rollup2
TO CONVINCE A JURY THAT THESE.

02:24:06.371 --> 02:24:08.740 region:rollup2
THAT THIS WAS BIASED MOTIVATION

02:24:07.772 --> 02:24:09.341 region:rollup2
OF THEIR HATE CRIMES THEY'RE

02:24:08.740 --> 02:24:09.975 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY NOT TO REPORT TO THE

02:24:09.975 --> 02:24:13.078 region:rollup2
LET ME ADD HERE THAT.

02:24:12.144 --> 02:24:14.012 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT

02:24:13.078 --> 02:24:16.748 region:rollup2

02:24:14.012 --> 02:24:17.883 region:rollup2
STATISTICAL.

02:24:16.748 --> 02:24:19.518 region:rollup2

IT'S ALSO A PROBLEM ON THE

02:24:22.354 --> 02:24:26.124 region:rollup2
GROUND IN CASES LIKE THIS THAT

02:24:24.089 --> 02:24:28.326 region:rollup2
IF POLICE THEM DON'T RECOGNIZE

02:24:26.124 --> 02:24:28.793 region:rollup2

BIAS.

02:24:49.614 --> 02:24:52.250 region:rollup2

02:38:37.541 --> 02:38:42.513 region:rollup2
RELATED AFFECTS.

02:38:40.144 --> 02:38:44.048 region:rollup2
MANY AFRICAN AMERICANS WE'LL TRY

02:38:42.513 --> 02:38:45.816 region:rollup2
TO COMPENSATE FOR THESE FEELINGS

02:38:44.048 --> 02:38:47.385 region:rollup2
BY HAVING A STRONGER SENSE OF

02:38:45.816 --> 02:38:48.919 region:rollup2
AFRICAN AMERICAN IDENTITY.

02:38:47.385 --> 02:38:50.855 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THIS IS TYPICALLY NOT

02:38:48.919 --> 02:38:53.991 region:rollup2
ENOUGH TO OVERCOME THE MENTAL

02:38:50.855 --> 02:38:55.393 region:rollup2
ANGUISH OF CONSTANT HATRED.

02:38:53.991 --> 02:38:57.461 region:rollup2
RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT TRAUMA

02:38:55.393 --> 02:39:00.064 region:rollup2
CAN ALTER ONE'S PERCEPTION OF

02:38:57.461 --> 02:39:01.399 region:rollup2
OVERALL SAFETY IN SOCIETY.

02:39:00.064 --> 02:39:03.134 region:rollup2
HATE CRIMES WITH AN ANIMUS

02:39:01.399 --> 02:39:05.169 region:rollup2
TOWARDS AFRICAN AMERICANS DOES

02:39:03.134 --> 02:39:07.004 region:rollup2
NOT JUST IMPACT THAT ONE PERSON

02:39:05.169 --> 02:39:08.672 region:rollup2
AT THAT MOMENT.

02:39:07.004 --> 02:39:10.474 region:rollup2
BUT HAS A SUSTAINING IMPACT ON

02:39:08.672 --> 02:39:12.209 region:rollup2
AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE

02:39:10.474 --> 02:39:13.911 region:rollup2
AND REINFORCES STEREOTYPICAL

02:39:12.209 --> 02:39:14.745 region:rollup2
IDEAS THAT AFRICAN AMERICANS

02:39:13.911 --> 02:39:17.281 region:rollup2
HAVE WORKED HARD. TO FIGHT

02:39:14.745 --> 02:39:18.783 region:rollup2
AGAINST.

02:39:17.281 --> 02:39:19.483 region:rollup2
IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO

02:39:18.783 --> 02:39:21.485 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND.

02:39:19.483 --> 02:39:22.820 region:rollup2
THAT AFRICAN AMERICANS ALSO

02:39:21.485 --> 02:39:25.856 region:rollup2
INTERSECT WITH OTHER GROUPS AS

02:39:22.820 --> 02:39:25.856 region:rollup2
WE SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER AFRICAN

02:39:25.923 --> 02:39:29.593 region:rollup2
THE LGBT COMMUNITY AFRICAN

02:39:27.925 --> 02:39:31.128 region:rollup2
AMERICANS WERE ALSO MUSLIM

02:39:29.593 --> 02:39:32.096 region:rollup2
AFRICAN AMERICANS.

02:39:31.128 --> 02:39:33.764 region:rollup2
OF WHO HAVE PHYSICAL

02:39:32.096 --> 02:39:36.333 region:rollup2
DISABILITIES.

02:39:33.764 --> 02:39:38.269 region:rollup2
I AM ALSO INCLUDED IN OF THE

02:39:36.333 --> 02:39:40.004 region:rollup2
INTERSECTION.

02:39:38.269 --> 02:39:41.639 region:rollup2
AND IT IS VERY STRESSFUL AND CAN

02:39:40.004 --> 02:39:42.940 region:rollup2
BE -- VERY

02:39:41.639 --> 02:39:44.942 region:rollup2
FRUSTRATING BECAUSE OF AN AMOUNT

02:39:42.940 --> 02:39:45.643 region:rollup2
OF FEAR WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW

02:39:44.942 --> 02:39:47.211 region:rollup2
WHETHER YOU'RE BEING

02:39:45.643 --> 02:39:48.579 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATED AGAINST BECAUSE OF

02:39:47.211 --> 02:39:51.182 region:rollup2
THEIR RACE OR BECAUSE WE'RE

02:39:48.579 --> 02:39:51.415 region:rollup2
DISABILITY OR BECAUSE OF YOUR

02:39:51.182 --> 02:39:55.352 region:rollup2
GENDER.

02:39:51.415 --> 02:39:56.654 region:rollup2
OF IDENTITY.

02:39:55.352 --> 02:39:58.456 region:rollup2
MOVING FORWARD THERE ARE TWO

02:39:56.654 --> 02:39:59.590 region:rollup2
MAIN POINTS THAT WE HOPE THE

02:39:58.456 --> 02:40:02.393 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE --

02:39:59.590 --> 02:40:03.727 region:rollup2
CONTINUES TO CONSIDER.

02:40:02.393 --> 02:40:05.529 region:rollup2
AS AN ORGANIZATION WE WANT TO

02:40:03.727 --> 02:40:06.030 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT COMMUNITIES.

02:40:05.529 --> 02:40:08.365 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE

02:40:06.030 --> 02:40:10.768 region:rollup2
EDUCATED ON HATE CRIMES AND

02:40:08.365 --> 02:40:12.536 region:rollup2
THEIR IMPACTS ON COMMUNITIES.

02:40:10.768 --> 02:40:13.804 region:rollup2
SECOND IT IS IMPORTANT TO

02:40:12.536 --> 02:40:14.405 region:rollup2
REMEMBER THAT THESE INCIDENTS

02:40:13.804 --> 02:40:16.040 region:rollup2
ALONG WITH AN ADEQUATE FOLLOW

02:40:14.405 --> 02:40:17.908 region:rollup2

02:40:16.040 --> 02:40:19.076 region:rollup2
AND REPORTING CONTRIBUTE TO THE

02:40:17.908 --> 02:40:20.411 region:rollup2
FEARS THAT COMMUNITIES CARRY

02:40:19.076 --> 02:40:22.880 region:rollup2
WITH THEM [inaudible] FOR

02:40:20.411 --> 02:40:25.349 region:rollup2
GENERATIONS.

02:40:22.880 --> 02:40:27.051 region:rollup2

02:44:24.188 --> 02:44:27.124 region:rollup2
ANY OF THESE ISSUES THAT THEY'RE

02:44:25.656 --> 02:44:28.726 region:rollup2
FACING SOARED TO THE TERMS OF

02:44:27.124 --> 02:44:29.626 region:rollup2
THE FEAR THAT IS GOING ON WITH

02:44:28.726 --> 02:44:30.627 region:rollup2
IMMIGRANTS.

02:44:29.626 --> 02:44:31.995 region:rollup2
YOU CAN ALMOST TOUCH IT YOU

02:44:30.627 --> 02:44:33.363 region:rollup2
COULD FEEL THE FEAR THAT

02:44:31.995 --> 02:44:35.065 region:rollup2
IMMIGRANTS ARE FEELING THAT THIS

02:44:33.363 --> 02:44:35.933 region:rollup2
IS THE ENVIRONMENT THAT A LOT OF

02:44:35.065 --> 02:44:39.269 region:rollup2
FOLKS ARE.

02:44:35.933 --> 02:44:41.638 region:rollup2
AYE LIVING DAILY ON THERE'S A

02:44:39.269 --> 02:44:43.006 region:rollup2
FEAR IN REPORTING HATE CRIMES IN

02:44:41.638 --> 02:44:45.275 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR --

02:44:43.006 --> 02:44:46.777 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND

02:44:45.275 --> 02:44:48.812 region:rollup2
ICE POLICE ENTANGLEMENT.

02:44:46.777 --> 02:44:50.647 region:rollup2
AGAIN CALIFORNIA HAS TAKEN THE

02:44:48.812 --> 02:44:52.683 region:rollup2
LEAD INTO AND PASSING

02:44:50.647 --> 02:44:55.219 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION LIKE THE TRUCKS DOT

02:44:52.683 --> 02:44:58.055 region:rollup2
THE TO THAT AND THE SANCTION AND

02:44:55.219 --> 02:44:58.555 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA VALUES ACT S. B..

02:44:58.055 --> 02:45:00.524 region:rollup2
FIFTY FOUR THESE ARE ALL

02:44:58.555 --> 02:45:01.892 region:rollup2
CRITICAL BUT IT IT'S VERY

02:45:00.524 --> 02:45:03.293 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT AS ONE OF MY

02:45:01.892 --> 02:45:04.795 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES MENTIONED EARLIER.

02:45:03.293 --> 02:45:06.864 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE FROM THE TOP

02:45:04.795 --> 02:45:09.933 region:rollup2
DOWN TALKING ABOUT THESE

02:45:06.864 --> 02:45:11.602 region:rollup2
POLICIES AND IT IN A WAY THAT.

02:45:09.933 --> 02:45:13.604 region:rollup2
INSURERS TRUST FROM COMMUNITY

02:45:11.602 --> 02:45:15.305 region:rollup2
MEMBERS WE HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:45:13.604 --> 02:45:16.707 region:rollup2
OUT THERE VOCALLY SAYING THAT

02:45:15.305 --> 02:45:19.610 region:rollup2
THEY ARE AGAINST SANCTUARY

02:45:16.707 --> 02:45:22.513 region:rollup2
POLICIES AGAINST SB.

02:45:19.610 --> 02:45:24.214 region:rollup2
FIFTY FOUR THAT SPREADS WIDE AND

02:45:22.513 --> 02:45:26.416 region:rollup2
DEEP INTO OUR COMMUNITIES IN

02:45:24.214 --> 02:45:28.185 region:rollup2
TERMS OF ENHANCING THAT FEAR.

02:45:26.416 --> 02:45:30.187 region:rollup2
OF FROM THE CALLING THE POLICE

02:45:28.185 --> 02:45:31.622 region:rollup2
THE ONLY WAY THAT A LOT OF OF

02:45:30.187 --> 02:45:32.990 region:rollup2
OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS CAN GET

02:45:31.622 --> 02:45:35.359 region:rollup2
SOME ASSISTANCE IS BY.

02:45:32.990 --> 02:45:36.727 region:rollup2
CALLING THE POLICE BUT KNOWING

02:45:35.359 --> 02:45:38.462 region:rollup2
THAT LEADERSHIP IS --

02:45:36.727 --> 02:45:40.764 region:rollup2
YOU.

02:45:38.462 --> 02:45:41.999 region:rollup2
IS NOT WORKING TO BUILD TRUST

02:45:40.764 --> 02:45:43.333 region:rollup2
WITH THESE COMMUNITIES REALLY

02:45:41.999 --> 02:45:44.635 region:rollup2
MAKES THOSE PHONE CALLS REALLY

02:45:43.333 --> 02:45:45.569 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO MAKE IT SPECIAL

02:45:44.635 --> 02:45:47.004 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU HAVE.

02:45:45.569 --> 02:45:48.405 region:rollup2
SOMEONE WHO'S UNDOCUMENTED OR

02:45:47.004 --> 02:45:49.473 region:rollup2
FAMILY MEMBERS OF THE THAT IS

02:45:48.405 --> 02:45:50.808 region:rollup2
UNDOCUMENTED.

02:45:49.473 --> 02:45:52.209 region:rollup2
SO REALLY LOOKING AT THOSE

02:45:50.808 --> 02:45:54.878 region:rollup2
POLICIES --

02:45:52.209 --> 02:45:55.946 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE THAT ICE AND POLICE

02:45:54.878 --> 02:45:56.547 region:rollup2
ENTANGLEMENT --

02:45:55.946 --> 02:45:59.249 region:rollup2
DOES NOT CONTINUE THAT WE KEEP

02:45:56.547 --> 02:46:02.219 region:rollup2
--

02:45:59.249 --> 02:46:04.488 region:rollup2
ICE AND POLICE COLLABORATIONS.

02:46:02.219 --> 02:46:05.956 region:rollup2
THAT WE CONTINUE TO HOLD --

02:46:04.488 --> 02:46:08.125 region:rollup2
OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT LEADERS

02:46:05.956 --> 02:46:09.827 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE FOR UPHOLDING THE

02:46:08.125 --> 02:46:11.328 region:rollup2
LAWS THAT THE STATE HAS PASSED I

02:46:09.827 --> 02:46:12.696 region:rollup2
THINK THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE

02:46:11.328 --> 02:46:14.832 region:rollup2
REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT AND THAT

02:46:12.696 --> 02:46:15.933 region:rollup2
ALSO STRIKES WITH --

02:46:14.832 --> 02:46:17.734 region:rollup2
THE TOP DOWN FROM THE ATTORNEY

02:46:15.933 --> 02:46:18.635 region:rollup2
GENERAL DEFINITELY --

02:46:17.734 --> 02:46:19.937 region:rollup2
ONE EVERY OTHER WAY HOW

02:46:18.635 --> 02:46:23.674 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT IS FOR THE ATTORNEY

02:46:19.937 --> 02:46:25.909 region:rollup2
GENERAL TO PROVIDE I'M REALLY --

02:46:23.674 --> 02:46:28.512 region:rollup2
AND MEANINGFUL GUIDANCE TO LAW

02:46:25.909 --> 02:46:29.813 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT SO THAT --

02:46:28.512 --> 02:46:31.315 region:rollup2
SOME OF THESE --

02:46:29.813 --> 02:46:33.517 region:rollup2
POLICIES CAN PERMEATE OUR

02:46:31.315 --> 02:46:35.118 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES MUCH BATTER AND SO

02:46:33.517 --> 02:46:37.788 region:rollup2
FEET SO THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN

02:46:35.118 --> 02:46:39.223 region:rollup2
FEEL SAFER COMING FORWARD AND

02:46:37.788 --> 02:46:41.358 region:rollup2
REPORTING THESE CRIMES --

02:46:39.223 --> 02:46:43.193 region:rollup2
I ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

02:46:41.358 --> 02:46:45.295 region:rollup2
AS MENTIONED EARLIER THAT WE DO

02:46:43.193 --> 02:46:46.530 region:rollup2
PROVIDE PROTECTIONS TO ALL CRIME

02:46:45.295 --> 02:46:48.365 region:rollup2
VICTIMS REGARDLESS OF

02:46:46.530 --> 02:46:50.234 region:rollup2
IMMIGRATION STATUS --

02:46:48.365 --> 02:46:51.869 region:rollup2

ABOUT HATE CRIMES --

02:46:53.837 --> 02:46:57.207 region:rollup2
WE HAVE SOMEONE TO FOR EXAMPLE

02:46:56.273 --> 02:46:58.508 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN --

02:46:57.207 --> 02:47:00.277 region:rollup2
THREATENED AND HARASSED BY THEIR

02:46:58.508 --> 02:47:01.411 region:rollup2
NEED -- FOR

02:47:00.277 --> 02:47:02.846 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WOULD THINK THEY WOULD

02:47:01.411 --> 02:47:04.882 region:rollup2
CALL RICE ON ON THIS PARTICULAR

02:47:02.846 --> 02:47:06.683 region:rollup2

02:47:11.088 --> 02:47:17.160 region:rollup2
OTHER RECOURSE OR ABILITY TO

FORWARD TO A COMMUNITY BASED ON

02:47:21.965 --> 02:47:24.968 region:rollup2
THE COMPONENT OBVIOUSLY IS

02:47:22.900 --> 02:47:27.037 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE ACCESS --

02:47:24.968 --> 02:47:28.772 region:rollup2
LATINOS ARE NOT A HOMOGENEOUS

02:47:27.037 --> 02:47:30.340 region:rollup2
AND IN THE FACT THAT WE DON'T

02:47:28.772 --> 02:47:32.075 region:rollup2
ALL SPEAK SPANISH A LOT OF US

02:47:30.340 --> 02:47:33.543 region:rollup2
ARE INDIGENOUS --

02:47:32.075 --> 02:47:34.978 region:rollup2
THE STORIES THAT I HAVE ACTUALLY

02:47:33.543 --> 02:47:37.648 region:rollup2
COME FROM SOME INDIGENOUS

02:47:34.978 --> 02:47:38.916 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES WHERE FOLKS SPEAK ME

02:47:37.648 --> 02:47:40.884 region:rollup2
SPECKLE --

02:47:38.916 --> 02:47:43.120 region:rollup2
AT THE END AND OTHER INDIGENOUS

02:47:40.884 --> 02:47:45.155 region:rollup2
LANGUAGES ON THE INABILITY FOR

02:47:43.120 --> 02:47:46.857 region:rollup2
LAW ENFORCEMENT TO CALL

02:47:45.155 --> 02:47:48.425 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE INTERPRETERS WHEN

02:47:46.857 --> 02:47:49.660 region:rollup2
VICTIMS TO COME FORWARD HIT IS

02:47:48.425 --> 02:47:51.428 region:rollup2
STILL AN ISSUE IT'S A

02:47:49.660 --> 02:47:52.863 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT ISSUE --

02:47:51.428 --> 02:47:54.498 region:rollup2
AND IT'S EVEN UP BROUGHT BIGGER

02:47:52.863 --> 02:47:55.899 region:rollup2
ISSUE FOR THESE INDIGENOUS

02:47:54.498 --> 02:47:57.801 region:rollup2
LANGUAGES --

02:47:55.899 --> 02:48:00.871 region:rollup2
WHERE THERE SEEMS TO BE NO

02:47:57.801 --> 02:48:02.639 region:rollup2
SUPPORT FOR COMMUNITY MEMBERS --

02:48:00.871 --> 02:48:03.874 region:rollup2
THAT COME FROM THE EAST.

02:48:02.639 --> 02:48:04.942 region:rollup2
CAN BE IS --

02:48:03.874 --> 02:48:06.209 region:rollup2
THEY COME FROM THESE LANGUAGE

02:48:04.942 --> 02:48:07.978 region:rollup2
MINORITIES AS WELL AND SO WE

02:48:06.209 --> 02:48:09.446 region:rollup2
REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT THE

02:48:07.978 --> 02:48:11.081 region:rollup2
PROVISION OF LANGUAGE ACCESS

02:48:09.446 --> 02:48:11.882 region:rollup2
SERVICES AND MAKE IT TIMELY IN

02:48:11.081 --> 02:48:13.450 region:rollup2
MAKING.

02:48:11.882 --> 02:48:14.751 region:rollup2
AND REAL TIME SO THAT LAW

02:48:13.450 --> 02:48:16.586 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT COULD FULLY

02:48:14.751 --> 02:48:18.522 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WHAT THESE FOLKS ARE

02:48:16.586 --> 02:48:20.023 region:rollup2
FACING ON THE GROUND --

02:48:18.522 --> 02:48:21.892 region:rollup2
AND THEN --

02:48:20.023 --> 02:48:23.293 region:rollup2
LASTLY I I JUST WANNA CAN

02:48:21.892 --> 02:48:25.295 region:rollup2
CONTINUE --

02:48:23.293 --> 02:48:26.763 region:rollup2
BY SAYING THAT I I DO THINK

02:48:25.295 --> 02:48:29.032 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA CAN LEAD ON THIS WE

02:48:26.763 --> 02:48:29.866 region:rollup2
CAN CONTINUE TO LEAD ON POLICIES

02:48:29.032 --> 02:48:32.336 region:rollup2
WHERE.

02:48:29.866 --> 02:48:33.737 region:rollup2
WE DO BILL THAT WERE LAW

02:48:32.336 --> 02:48:35.339 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT DOES TAKE IT THE

02:48:33.737 --> 02:48:37.441 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP AND BUILD.

02:48:35.339 --> 02:48:38.475 region:rollup2
UP BILLS THAT TRUST WITH GOT

02:48:37.441 --> 02:48:40.243 region:rollup2
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES SO THE

02:48:38.475 --> 02:48:42.713 region:rollup2
DEMOCRATS CAN FEEL SAFE AND

02:48:40.243 --> 02:48:46.249 region:rollup2
INCOME FORWARD --

02:48:42.713 --> 02:48:47.651 region:rollup2
AND I DID ONE HIGHLIGHT THE MOST

02:48:46.249 --> 02:48:48.885 region:rollup2
RECENT ANECDOTES OF HE CLAIMS

02:48:47.651 --> 02:48:51.154 region:rollup2
THAT OUR COMMUNITY --

02:48:48.885 --> 02:48:53.256 region:rollup2
I'LL JUST GIVE YOU ONE THE MOST

02:48:51.154 --> 02:48:54.925 region:rollup2
RECENT ONE THAT --

02:48:53.256 --> 02:48:56.159 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN MAKING THE WAYS AND IN

02:48:54.925 --> 02:48:57.728 region:rollup2
MEDIA HAS BEEN.

02:48:56.159 --> 02:48:59.630 region:rollup2
THE INCIDENT THAT OCCURRED ON

02:48:57.728 --> 02:49:02.165 region:rollup2
JULY FOURTH THERE WAS A ELDERLY

02:48:59.630 --> 02:49:05.035 region:rollup2
GENTLEMEN WALKING DOWN THE

02:49:02.165 --> 02:49:06.103 region:rollup2
STREET AND HE WAS ACCUSED OF OF

02:49:05.035 --> 02:49:07.537 region:rollup2
BUMPING INTO.

02:49:06.103 --> 02:49:10.040 region:rollup2
A LITTLE FOR ALL --

02:49:07.537 --> 02:49:12.009 region:rollup2
THE MOTHER OF THIS YOUNG GIRL.

02:49:10.040 --> 02:49:12.642 region:rollup2
HE REALLY GAVE ME AND STARTED

02:49:12.009 --> 02:49:14.911 region:rollup2
YELLING HUNTING AND TELLING HIM

02:49:12.642 --> 02:49:16.213 region:rollup2
TO GO BACK COUNTRY.

02:49:14.911 --> 02:49:17.881 region:rollup2
SHE ASSAULTED HIM WITH THE BREAK

02:49:16.213 --> 02:49:18.815 region:rollup2
UP OTHER A COMMUNITY MEMBERS

02:49:17.881 --> 02:49:19.983 region:rollup2
WANTED TO JUMP IN AND HELP BUT

02:49:18.815 --> 02:49:21.018 region:rollup2
THEY WERE ALSO THREATENED BY

02:49:19.983 --> 02:49:23.153 region:rollup2
THIS WOMAN.

02:49:21.018 --> 02:49:24.388 region:rollup2
IF YOU STEP IF YOU TAKE ONE STEP

02:49:23.153 --> 02:49:25.689 region:rollup2
CLOSER.

02:49:24.388 --> 02:49:26.423 region:rollup2
BEGIN ALL DO THE SAME HARM TO

02:49:25.689 --> 02:49:27.991 region:rollup2
YOU AND SO --

02:49:26.423 --> 02:49:29.760 region:rollup2
EITHER THESE ARE INCIDENTS THAT

02:49:29.760 --> 02:49:31.595 region:rollup2
I'LL.

02:49:30.594 --> 02:49:33.397 region:rollup2
AFFECTING FOLKS IN THAT

02:49:31.595 --> 02:49:34.898 region:rollup2
INTERSECTIONAL NOT MANNER THAT

02:49:33.397 --> 02:49:37.234 region:rollup2

02:49:34.898 --> 02:49:38.602 region:rollup2
STATUS GRACE. EIGHT SHOULD

02:49:37.234 --> 02:49:39.836 region:rollup2
DISABILITY --

02:49:38.602 --> 02:49:43.273 region:rollup2
AND SO WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT

02:49:39.836 --> 02:49:46.376 region:rollup2
WAYS TO ENSURE THAT.

02:49:43.273 --> 02:49:48.145 region:rollup2
I FEEL WHEN VICTIMS [inaudible]

02:49:46.376 --> 02:49:50.714 region:rollup2
PLEASE TO COURT THIS IN A WAY

02:49:48.145 --> 02:49:52.082 region:rollup2
THAT IS SAFE.

02:49:50.714 --> 02:49:54.184 region:rollup2
AND THAT --

02:49:52.082 --> 02:49:56.253 region:rollup2
REALLY HONORS.

02:49:54.184 --> 02:49:57.921 region:rollup2
WHAT THE INCIDENT --

02:49:56.253 --> 02:49:59.690 region:rollup2
MEANS TO THEM AND HOW IT HAS

02:49:57.921 --> 02:50:00.957 region:rollup2
IMPACTED THEM BECAUSE IT'S IT'S

02:49:59.690 --> 02:50:02.159 region:rollup2
SO IMPORTANT THAT WE LOOK AT ALL

02:50:00.957 --> 02:50:03.794 region:rollup2
FACETS.

02:50:02.159 --> 02:50:05.362 region:rollup2
OF THE STORIES ARE NOT JUST LOOK

02:50:06.863 --> 02:50:09.599 region:rollup2
THE ROOT CAUSES OF HATE CRIMES

IF YOU'RE NOT EVEN CHECKED AT

03:01:00.016 --> 03:01:02.819 region:rollup2
THAT LEVEL AND THEN YOU RISE UP

03:01:00.650 --> 03:01:05.288 region:rollup2
--

03:01:02.819 --> 03:01:06.723 region:rollup2
EVEN FURTHER AND YOU REALLY MORE

03:01:05.288 --> 03:01:08.825 region:rollup2
HARASSING PEOPLE --

03:01:06.723 --> 03:01:09.559 region:rollup2
BE IT IN THE SCHOOL CONTEXT AND

03:01:08.825 --> 03:01:12.528 region:rollup2
IT'S BULLYING.

03:01:09.559 --> 03:01:14.297 region:rollup2
A A WORKPLACE CONTEXT AND IT

03:01:12.528 --> 03:01:16.733 region:rollup2
WHERE LEGAL LIABILITY --

03:01:14.297 --> 03:01:18.735 region:rollup2
MAY ATTACH SUDDENLY OR NOT RUN

03:01:16.733 --> 03:01:20.903 region:rollup2
[inaudible] TO SOME.

03:01:18.735 --> 03:01:21.904 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW YOU PURSUE IT'S

03:01:20.903 --> 03:01:22.438 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT TO YOU --

03:01:21.904 --> 03:01:24.040 region:rollup2
DEVOUT DENYING THEM A JOB

03:01:22.438 --> 03:01:25.308 region:rollup2
ETCETERA.

03:01:24.040 --> 03:01:26.209 region:rollup2
AND THEN YOU MOVE UP FURTHER

03:01:25.308 --> 03:01:28.344 region:rollup2
FROM THERE IF YOU'RE STILL NOT

03:01:26.209 --> 03:01:30.012 region:rollup2
CHECKED AND THAT'S WHERE YOU GET

03:01:28.344 --> 03:01:31.314 region:rollup2
INTO HATE CRIMES LOW LEVEL HATE

03:01:30.012 --> 03:01:32.515 region:rollup2
CRIMES MORE VIOLENT HATE CRIMES

03:01:31.314 --> 03:01:33.649 region:rollup2
AND ULTIMATELY OF COURSE THE

03:01:32.515 --> 03:01:35.051 region:rollup2
VERY TOP OF THE PYRAMID

03:01:33.649 --> 03:01:36.452 region:rollup2
CONSIDERING A WE DEVELOP THIS IN

03:01:35.051 --> 03:01:36.719 region:rollup2
THE HOLOCAUST EDUCATION IS

03:01:36.452 --> 03:01:38.321 region:rollup2
GENOCIDE.

03:01:36.719 --> 03:01:39.489 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S THAT WOULD BE

03:01:38.321 --> 03:01:40.690 region:rollup2
THE VERY TOP.

03:01:39.489 --> 03:01:41.758 region:rollup2
AND THE IDEA IS THAT IT ALL

03:01:40.690 --> 03:01:43.192 region:rollup2
STARTS AT THE BOTTOM WITH THESE

03:01:41.758 --> 03:01:43.860 region:rollup2
WORDS.

03:01:43.192 --> 03:01:45.661 region:rollup2
BUT THESE BIASED ATTITUDES THAT
