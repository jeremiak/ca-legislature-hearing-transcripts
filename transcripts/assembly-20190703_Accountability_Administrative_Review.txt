I HAD SOME WONDERFUL WITNESSES HERE TO TESTIFY ON THE BILL -- THANK YOU OF THANK YOU CHAIR -- MY NAME IS KATHERINE PHILLIPS I'M WITH SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA THIS PROPERTY IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT AND THIS ISN'T ABOUT STOPPING IN -- H.

JOHN YOUR THE FOUNDER OF SIERRA CLUB WHO FOUNDED IN -- EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAS STUDIED THIS THIS. PARTICULAR PROPERTY THIS TOUGH A PARK AREA IT'S WHERE MULTIPLE BIOTIC REGION'S COME TOGETHER A STATEMENT BY MORE THAN FORTY BY FORTY FIVE SCIENTISTS ABOUT THE ECOLOGICAL VALUE OF THIS PROPERTY. OF THAT WAS SIGNED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN NOTED THAT THERE WERE -- FORTY TWO SPECIAL STATUS WILDLIFE SPECIES EIGHT FEDERALLY OR STATE LISTED IN CANDIDATES SPECIES THIRTEEN SPECIAL STATUS IN TWENTY EIGHT LOCALLY RARE PLANT SPECIES SEVENTH. SENSITIVE VEGETATION COMMUNITIES THERE HAVE BEEN -- RESEARCHERS COMING FROM UC BERKELEY FOR DECADES BRINGING THEIR GRADUATE STUDENTS OR THEMSELVES TO RESEARCH AT THIS AREA. NOW AT THE TIME OF CLIMATE CHANGE WE NEED SPECIAL REFUGIA FOR SPECIES -- THIS THIS MORE THAN EVER MORE THAN EVEN WHEN IT WAS ACQUIRED IN THEIR EARLY EARLY NINETIES THIS MORE THAN EVER IS A TIME WHEN WE NEED TO PROTECT THIS AREA. TURN IT INTO A PASSIVE PARK THAT -- WHERE THERE'S LESS OPPORTUNITY -- FOR SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO THE SPECIES AND TO THE TO THIS TO THE THESE BUYOUT BIOTIC. SYSTEMS THERE. THANK YOU AND BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT WITNESS WE'RE JUST GONNA PAUSE SO WE CAN ESTABLISH A QUORUM SECRETARY IF YOU CAN PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. PETRIE-NORRIS PRESENT PT PETRIE-NORRIS PRESENT. PATTERSON PATTERSON PRESIDENT BURKE [inaudible] LACKEY MEDINA. MEDINA PRESENT QUIRK SILVA SMITH SMITH PRESENT. GREAT THANK YOU IF YOU COULD. PLEASE CARRY ON A GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS EXCUSE MY BACK ON MY NAME'S BETH SOURCE BURKE AND I'M WITH THE EAST BAY CHAPTER OF THE CALIFORNIA NATIVE PLANT SOCIETY. TO SAVE TIME I'M GOING TO REFER TO THE ALAMEDA TESLA EXPANSIONARY AS TESLA. PRESERVING TESLA IS A LOCAL PRESERVATION PRIORITY THAT'S WHY THERE'S OVERWHELMING SUPPORT FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AGENCIES NATIVE AMERICAN GROUPS RANCHERS CITIZENS AND CONSERVATIONISTS FOR THIS BILL. TEST THE WAS PURCHASED -- FOR H. B. USE BUT WITHOUT AN ACQUISITION E. I. R.. AN ACQUISITION E. I. R. WOULD HAVE REVEALED THE PLACE SO SPECIAL THAT IT MEETS THE DESCRIPTIONS OF BOTH THE NATURAL AND CULTURAL PRESERVE. AS FOUND IN THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE SECTION FIFTY NINETEEN POINT SEVEN ONE AND POINT. SEVEN FOUR UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS THE H. M. V. R. DIVISION HAS BEEN TRYING TO PUT AWAY TO THE RECREATION ON TO LAND NOT APPROPRIATE FOR THAT USE. RESEARCH NUMEROUS STUDIES AN ANALYSIS OF THE O. H. M. V. OURS DIVISIONS OWN DATA. DETAIL TEST THOSE RARE AND IRREPLACEABLE NATURAL RESOURCES AND SHOW THAT THEY'RE DISTRIBUTED LAYER UPON LAYER THROUGHOUT ALMOST THE ENTIRE EXPANSION AREA. THE RESOURCES INCLUDE THREATENED ENDANGERED AND SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES SENSITIVE HABITATS AND VEGETATION COMMUNITIES RARE PLANTS AND A CRITICAL LINKAGE WILDLIFE CARTER. AS WITH CLIMATE CHANGE THE SCIENCE HERE IS CLEAR TESLA HAS ABUNDANT SENSITIVE RESOURCES AND MUST BE PROTECTED IN ITS ENTIRETY. IT'S NOT POSSIBLE BOTH TO PRESERVE THESE NATURAL RESOURCES AND TO ALLOW -- HD RECREATION AT TESLA. TESLA CANNOT BE MOVED AND IT CANNOT BE REPLACED -- WHICH THE RECREATION CAN BE LOCATED ELSEWHERE ON LAND APPROPRIATE FOR THAT ACTIVITY. A PREVIOUS BILL SB TWO FORTY NINE DOES NOT ADDRESS TESLA IN ANY WAY. IT BUT IF SB TWO FORTY NINE AND A PRIOR LAW HAD BEEN FOLLOWED NEARLY ALL OF TESLA WOULD BE DESIGNATED AS A LEGALLY DEFINED SENSITIVE AREA AND PRESERVE WITHOUT OHB USE. THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY SB SEVEN SIXTY SEVEN ADDRESSES A LOCAL ISSUE WITH UNIQUE HISTORY INSTEAD OF FACTS. IT DOES NOT AFFECT THE CARNEGIE SB ARE A IT DOES NOT ESTABLISH A PRECEDENT. SB SEVEN SIXTY SEVEN PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESOLVE FOR TWENTY YEARS AND COUNTING CONTROVERSY IN A WAY THAT IS WISE AND FAIR. IT ALLOWS STATE PARKS TO CONSIDER THE BROADER PUBLIC INTEREST IN THE USE OF TESLA. IT ALLOWS FOR THE SALE OF TESTS THE FOR CONSERVATION PURPOSES AND RETURNS PROCEEDS TO THE HMV OUR DIVISION. FINALLY SB SEVEN SIXTY SEVEN ALIGNS WITH OUR STATE'S NATURAL RESOURCE AGENCIES MISSION TO RESTORE PROTECT AND MANAGE THE STATE'S NATURAL HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL RESOURCES FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE GENERATIONS.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU I HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION GOOD MORNING. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TERRY MCHALE WITH THEIR AND READ AND SO SEATS. REPRESENTING A CONSORTIUM OF OUR OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE RECREATION THIS. WE OPPOSE THIS BILL LAST YEAR. AND WE OPPOSE IT THIS YEAR THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR. IS THAT THE PURCHASE PRICE LAST YEAR WAS THE WAS THE CEILING IN THIS YEAR IT'S THE FLOOR. BUT IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH AND WE WOULD SUGGEST IF THIS GOES TO IF IT GOES TO APPROPRIATIONS AND FURTHER DISCUSSIONS. THAT IF THIS LAND IS SOLD IT SOLD AT MARKET VALUE. THIS PROPERTY WAS SET ASIDE FOR A SPECIFIC PURPOSE. HE WAS SET ASIDE BY EARMARKED FUNDS AND WAS SATISFIED BY PEOPLE WHO PAID FOR THROUGH THE RECREATIONAL ACTIVITY AND THE RED AND GREEN STICKER FEE. THAT MONEY IS REAL IT BELONGS TO THEM AND BE WRONG TO STEAL THEIR LAND AND THEN TAKE THEIR MONEY. TO NUMBER. TWO WE SPENT A YEAR. WORKING ON OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE RECREATION TO MAKE THE OF THE PROGRAM PERMANENT. THE BILL WAS SB. TWO FORTY NINE IT WAS SUGGESTED IN EARLIER TESTIMONY THAT HAD SB TWO FORTY NINE BEEN IN PLACE. THAT TESLA WOULD HAVE BEEN PRESERVED AS IT EXISTS RIGHT NOW. LET ME BE CLEAR I SAT IN ON EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE MEETINGS ON SB. TWO FORTY NINE TESLA REPRESENTATIVES CAME TO THE BEGINNING OF THE DISCUSSION AND THEN LEFT AND REFUSED TO PARTICIPATE. AND THE REASON THEY REFUSE TO PARTICIPATE IS BECAUSE WE WOULD NOT. WE WOULD NOT DO WHAT THIS BILL DOES. SO AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THEY WITHDREW. THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE BILL THEY DID NOT EVEN SUPPORT THE BILL WHEN IT WAS CONCLUDED. NUMBER THREE THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PLUS STATE PARKS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ALL OF THEM HAVE EXTRAORDINARY VALUE -- HD SUPPORTS THE CATHEDRAL PARKS WE SUPPORT THE PARKS WHERE YOU CAN WALK WE SUPPORT THE PARKS. YOU KNOW THAT THAT FAMILIES GO TO PICNIC OR PEOPLE GOING TO HIKE ONLY EIGHT OF THEM. EIGHT OF THEM ARE OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE RECREATION AREAS. THEY PRODUCE A BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT'S A IT'S A PROGRAM THAT. THE THE DIRECTOR OF CAL PARKS CALLED IN TESTIMONY. A NATIONAL MODEL. US SO THE IDEA YOU KNOW WHEN I BILL SHOW THE PICTURES ALSO THE DAMAGED HILLSIDES. IN THOSE SAY THIS IS AN EXAMPLE. OF THE CORRUPTING INFLUENCE OF HV. WELL I WOULD SAY THERE'S ONLY EIGHT OF AND WHEN I GO TO AN OHP PARK AND I SEE THOSE HILLSIDES WITH PATHWAYS I SEE A SAFER WAY TO RECREATION. BUT I ALSO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT EIGHTH SB TWO FORTY NINE WHEN YOU SEE THAT CORRUPTED HILL SIDE. WE HAVE MADE AN AGREEMENT. THAT IT WILL BE RESTORED PERIODICALLY TO PRISTINE ACTIVITY AND WE MOVED TO A DIFFERENT AREA WITHIN THE PARK -- HV RECREATION AS A NATIONAL MODEL BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE SCIENTISTS WORKING -- FOR H. B. RECREATION THAN ANY OTHER PART OF THE PARKS. THAT WE SPEND MORE TIME ON CULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES THAN ANY OTHER PART OF THE PARK'S. WHEN THE INDIVIDUALS UP HERE SAY THAT THEY'RE CONCERNED? THAT -- H. B. WILL DESTROY THE AREA I WOULD SUGGEST ALSO THAT THERE ARE AREAS IN ALMOST EVERY OHB PARKING WHICH CULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES ARE SET ASIDE AND PRESERVED. NUMBER FOUR IMAGINE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A WAY TO BE. IMAGINE THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE RECREATION. THEN I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE ARE ESTABLISHING A VERY DIFFICULT BUREAUCRATIC PROCESS. FOR DECADES WHEN LOCAL PROPERTY IS GOING TO BE USED BY THE STATE THERE ARE EXTENSIVE HEARINGS AND THE LOCALS ARE INVITED TO BE A PART OF IT. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED HERE. NOW WHAT THIS BILL SAYS IS OKAY THERE IS AN AGREEMENT THE MONEY IS SET ASIDE FOR ABOUT TO DO IT AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO THROW THAT PROCESS OUT. AND MAKE IT A MULLIGAN. AND WE'RE GONNA GO BACK AND REDO THE HEARINGS AGAIN. WELL. IF YOU LIVE IN A BEACH AREA THEN YOU WAKE UP AND YOU SAY I DON'T WANT MY BEACH BEING TOUCH BECAUSE PEOPLE SHOW UP AND RUN ON THE BEACH ARE GONNA CREATE. DUST PARTICULATES ARE TOO MUCH NOISE OR TOO MUCH TRAFFIC WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT. AND IF YOU GO TO AN AREA WHERE IT'S MOUNTAIN BIKING. AND PEOPLE ARE UPSET BECAUSE THE RIGHTS OF THE MOUNTAIN BIKE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT. AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE HORSES IN THESE AREAS AND WHAT WE SET ASIDE THE HORSES WE GO BACK AND LOCAL SAY MY GOD HORSES DO WITH HORSES DO. AND WE DON'T WANT THAT BEING DONE WHAT THIS WOULD DO WOULD BE TO SET UP A PRECEDENT IN WHICH ALL. OF THE LANDS BEING SET ASIDE BY NATURAL RESOURCES BY RESOURCES OR BY PARKS WOULD BE OPEN TO THE DISCUSSION. NUMBER. FIVE THIS BILL ONLY SAYS. IF IT TURNS OUT THAT THE PROCESS OF PROCESSES BEEN TRIED AND TRUE AND EFFECTIVE IN WORKABLE WAS SOMEHOW FAULTED. AND I DON'T BELIEVE IT WAS OR IF IT SAYS THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS IN THE LOCALS WHO SIGNED OFF. ON TESLA. MANY OF THEM WHO MADE AGREEMENTS AS TESLA WAS SATISFIED. NOW SAY THAT IT'S UNFAIR. THEN THE LAND GETS SOLD. I WOULD LIKE TO BE ON RECORD AND I'D LIKE THE LEGISLATURE TO BE ON RECORD TO STATE OF THE COURTS. IF PER CHANCE THIS BILL PASSES AND SIGNED IN TAKES PLACE. AFTER THE HEARING TAKES PLACE AND IT TURNS OUT. THAT PARKS DID EVERYTHING RIGHT. THAT WE STOP THE NONSENSE AND WE EXPEDITE MAKING THIS -- HV PROPERTY. A NUMBER NINE IT'S JUST ON A PERSONAL NOTE. THIS IS A VERY PASSIONATE ISSUE -- ERIN RITA SO SEATS WERE LUCKY TO REPRESENT A LOT OF EXCELLENT CLIENTS. THE WAY TO BE IS ALWAYS SORT OF THE RED HEADED STEP CHILD OF PARKS. IT'S DIFFICULT TO COME IN AND IT GETS VERY PASSIONATE ON A PERSONAL NOTE I WANT TO SAY I ALWAYS DISLIKED BEING ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF SENATOR GLAZER. I THINK HE'S AN INCREDIBLY CONSCIENTIOUS LEGISLATOR. AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYBODY WHO WORKS HARDER FOR HIS CONSTITUENTS. AND I KNOW THE BILL WAS UP LAST YEAR AND HE WILL COME BACK NEXT YEAR AND COME BACK FOR EVER ON THIS BILL. HOWEVER HAVING SAID THAT I THINK IT IS WRONG CITED I THINK IT GOES IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. AND I WOULD ASK THAT YOU REJECTED THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS AMY GRANITE AND I'M REPRESENTING THE OFF ROAD VEHICLE LEGISLATIVE COALITION -- BUT I HAVE TO CONFESS THAT I'M JUST AN AVERAGE OFF ROADER I'M NOT A LOBBYIST AND I DON'T SPEAK PROFESSIONALLY IN FRONT OF HEARINGS. BUT WHAT I DO WANT TO SAY IS THAT AS AN AVERAGE OFF ROADER AVERAGE OPERATORS DESERVE A VOICE TO AND THAT'S SOMETHING THEY HAVE NOT BEEN GRANTED AT ALL IN THIS PROCESS AND IT'S VERY VERY FRUSTRATING -- INSTEAD WE'VE BEEN PAINTED AS IRRESPONSIBLE WE'VE BEEN PAINTED WITH. MANY MANY ADJECTIVES THAT NOBODY WOULD LIKE TO BEAR. SOMETIMES IT'S DIFFICULT TO SPEAK TRUTH TO POWER BUT IN THIS CASE WE FIND THAT WE HAVE. TO THE ILL CONCEIVED TRAVESTY THAT IS SB SEVEN SIXTY SEVEN IS GONE ON TOO LONG FOR US TO CONTINUE TO BE POLITE. EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS BILL CHEATS THE AVERAGE CALIFORNIA AS WEALTHY AND POLITICALLY CONNECTED INDIVIDUALS USE POLITICIANS AND THE POLITICAL SYSTEM TO GET THEIR WAY. NOW THE BILL HAS BEEN AMENDED TO CHEAT OFF ROADERS OUT OF THE LAND THEY PAID FOR OUT OF THE WHICH WE TRUST FUND. AND CHEAP THE WHICH WE TRUST FUND OUT OF ANY MEANING FULL REIMBURSEMENT. AS OFF ROADERS WE GET USED TO THE NAME CALLING WE GET USED TO THE IDEOLOGY BASED ON HATE FOR WHAT WE DO. THIS BILL ALSO CHEATS STATE PARKS AT OF ALL THE TIME AND ALL THE MONEY THEY SPENT OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS PUTTING INTO IMPROVEMENTS INTO THE ALAMEDA TESSLER EXPANSION AREA. FOR WHAT GOAL. WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IS PRIVATIZE A STATE PARK? TO CREATE AN EXCLUSIVE PLAYGROUND CLOSE TO ANYONE THAT OTHERS WOULD DEEM UNWORTHY. IT SETS A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT THAT WOULD ALLOW ANY SEMBLANCE OF ACCUSATION TO BE USED AS AN EXCUSE. TO FORCE THE SALE OF A STATE PARK AND KEEP OUT QUOTE UNQUOTE UNDESIRABLE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. RESPECTFULLY THIS BILL WOULD DEPRIVE THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS OF ACCESS SHORT CHANGES THE STATE OUT OF MONEY SPENT PER STATE LAW WITH GOOD INTENT AND WHAT COULD. CAUSE HARM TO THE AREA ITSELF COUNTER TO WHAT IS PREVIOUSLY BEEN TESTIFIED BECAUSE HE ALWAYS CHEN BR DIVISION THE STATE PARK ACTUALLY HAS THE HIGHEST MANDATED -- CAM STRINGENT ECONOMIC REGULATIONS OF ANYONE ANY COUNTY PARK IN THE STATE PARK ANY OF AND CERTAINLY ANY PRIVATE PROPERTY -- THEY SPEND MORE MONEY ON ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS AND ANY OTHER ENTITY OF STATE PARKS -- THE SUPPORTERS OF THE ONLY ONES TO GAME THE SAME PEOPLE WHO TOLD ME. WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE LIKE YOU IN OUR COMMUNITY AND THAT ACTUALLY WAS SAID TO BE IN ONE OF THESE MEETINGS I UNDERSTAND THE MEETINGS GET HEATED. BUT THAT TYPE OF APPROACH THAT STATEMENT SHOULD NEVER BE SAID TO ANYBODY -- AT THE TIME I HAD MY SERVICE DOG WITH ME AND ASKED YOU KNOW WAS IT AN ISSUE THAT I WAS A GRANDMOTHER WERE DOG OWNER WHICH ONE AND OF COURSE THEY DIDN'T LIKE IT AND WALKED AWAY -- WE CANNOT ALLOW ELITISM TO WIN AND WE CANNOT ALLOW LEADERS AND TO TAKE AWAY STATE PARKS YOU'VE HEARD FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE FROM THE BAY AREA WHAT YOU HAVEN'T HEARD FROM OF THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY GO TO CARNEGIE. LOT OF PEOPLE FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY GO TO CARNEGIE. UP AND DOWN THE STATE A LOT OF PEOPLE FROM SACRAMENTO GO TO CARNEGIE [inaudible] POLICIES. NICE RING -- TO I'M OLD ENOUGH THAT I REMEMBER WHERE THAT CAME FROM -- BUT ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE MANY OF THEM ARE HARD WORKING INDIVIDUALS THAT CAN COME TO A HEARING LIKE THIS BECAUSE THEY'RE YOUNG THEY HAVE FAMILIES THEY WORK FOR A LIVING AND THEY CAN'T TAKE OFF. EVERY TIME THIS BILL IS BEING HEARD SO THEREFORE I HAVE TO TRY AND EXPRESS THEIR FRUSTRATION THAT THEY ARE NOT BEING HEARD -- AGAIN. WE ASK THAT YOU TO OPPOSE THIS BILL NOT TO ALLOW THIS PRESIDENT TO BE SET. IN TO REALLY STAND UP FOR THE AVERAGE CALIFORNIA -- BECAUSE WE NEED [inaudible] TO THANK YOU.

OKAY MOVING I TO FILE ITEM -- FOR SENATOR CHIANG GOOD MORNING. A GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS SAY I'M HERE TO PRESENT SENATE BILL. THREE FORTY EIGHT SENATE BILL THREE FORTY IT WOULD CALL ON THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY TO DEVELOP A PLAN TO IMPLEMENT THE USE OF ART ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FIVE BETTER SERVICE AND DIFFERENT STATE AGENCIES. ACROSS AMERICA STATES LIKE INDIANA NEW YORK AND MASSACHUSETTS HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO STUDY THE ISSUE OF A AYE ITS IMPLICATIONS AND POSSIBLE REGULATIONS. I BELIEVE THAT PART OF OUR JOB AS LEGISLATORS IS TO MAKE GOVERNMENT ACCESSIBLE AND IMPROVE SERVICES FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. PART OF MAKING GOVERNMENT ACCESSIBLE IS USING NEW AND EXISTING TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDE A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE FOR THOSE WHO INTERACT WITH DIFFERENT PARTS OF OUR STATE GOVERNMENT. WE NEED TO ACT NOW TO BRING THAT TECHNOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE VARIOUS AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. RECENT AMENDMENTS HELP LINE THIS BILL WITH OTHER LEGISLATION ON A AYE TO ENSURE THEY COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER. THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION REPORT THIS YEAR'S SOUNDED THE ALARM THAT THE STATE IS NOT PROPERLY FOCUSED ON A AYE AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS WAS THE FOUNDATION FOR THIS BILL. A I WAS COMING WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT AND WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED TO ACCEPT AND USE THIS TECHNOLOGY TO THE BEST OF ITS POTENTIAL AS WELL AS MEDICAID FOR RISKS. THIS BILL CODIFIES THAT STATE LEADERS NEED TO FOCUS ON THIS ISSUE IN A HOLISTIC WAY. THIS BILL HAS ZERO NO VOTES AND WAS ON CONSENT AND PRIVACY COMMITTEE AND WITH ME HERE TODAY IS TO LISTEN TO GONZALEZ OF THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION TO SHARE THEIR PERSPECTIVE WITH THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU A GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS HE SAID THAT GONZALEZ AND I'M A RESEARCH ANALYST WITH THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION HERE IN SUPPORT OF SB. THREE FORTY EIGHT THE COMMISSION IS AN INDEPENDENT BIPARTISAN OVERSIGHT AGENCY CHARGED WITH RECOMMENDING WAYS TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF STATE GOVERNMENT. LAST YEAR THE COMMISSION BEGAN A STUDY TO UNDERSTAND HOW OUR STATE IS PREPARING FOR THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT A I CAN PROVIDE TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. AFTER AN ELEVENTH MONTH STUDY THE COMMISSION RELEASED ITS REPORT. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE A ROADMAP FOR CALIFORNIA. THROUGH OUR STUDY THE COMMISSION AND IDENTIFIED MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO USE A AYE. LET ME CITE JUST TWO EXAMPLES A I SYSTEMS ALLOWED SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS IN TACOMA WASHINGTON TO IDENTIFY APRS STUDENTS AND INTERVENE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT. RAISING GRADUATION RATES. AND MICHIGAN USES A AYE TO PREDICT THE LIKELIHOOD OF DRUG RELATED DEATHS AND REVEAL OTHER INSIGHTS INTO THE STATE'S -- OPIOID EPIDEMIC AND WHILE CALIFORNIA STATE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE STRIDES TO IMPROVE OPERATIONS AND SERVICES EMPLOYING MODERN TECHNOLOGY. IT IS UNDER PREPARED TO RESPOND AND ADAPT TO THE RAPID CHANGES BROUGHT BY THE DEVELOPMENT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. CALIFORNIA IS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AND IT TECHNOLOGICAL POWER HOUSE. BUT THE COMMISSION FOUND THAT A STRATEGIC PLANNING VOID EXISTS IN STATE GOVERNMENT AROUND SEIZING OPPORTUNITIES OF A AYE AND MINIMIZING ITS REST. OUR REPORT ISSUE TEN RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE TO HELP FILL THIS VOID AND PROVIDE THE VISION OF COORDINATION AND SYSTEM SUSTAINED UNIFIED EFFORT FOR CALIFORNIA TO GOVERN FOR THE FUTURE. AMONG ITS RECOMMENDATIONS THE COMMISSION CALLED FOR THE CREATION OF STATE LEAD TO STRATEGIC PLANS FOR THE USE OF A AYE TECHNOLOGY TO IMPROVE GOVERNMENT SERVICES AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT ON THE STATE'S WORK FORCE AND JOB CLASSIFICATIONS. THE COMMISSION ALSO CARD CALLED FOR THE GOVERNOR TO APPOINT A SPECIAL ADVISER ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO DEVELOP A STRAIGHT WHITE STATEWIDE STRATEGIC PLAN THAT INCORPORATES A AYE WHEN IN STATE GOVERNMENT. AND RECOMMENDED ENCOURAGING CERTAIN INDEPENDENT OFFICES TO DESIGNATE ACHIEVE A AYE OFFICER. SB THREE FORTY EIGHT WOULD ADVANCE THE GOALS OF THE COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATIONS AND HELP THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY FOCUS ON THE STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF A AYE TECHNOLOGY FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION RESPECTFULLY REQUEST. FOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU AT OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WHEN THIS IS IN OPPOSITION? SEE NINE OUT QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. I I HAVE A QUESTION IS I'VE SHARED WITH THE AUTHOR I AM SO SUPPORTIVE OF THE INTENT OF THIS BILL I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE AS A STATE. I LOOKED STRATEGICALLY AT A AYE AT AUTOMATION. AND UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS OF TECHNOLOGY FOR THE FUTURE OF GOVERNMENT AND FOR THE FUTURE OF WORK. MY CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL IS THAT IT. IT'S SEEMS DUPLICATIVE OF AB PROGRAMS THAT ARE EITHER. I HAVE JUST BEEN IMPLEMENTED FOR A NUMBER OF BILLS THAT ARE BEING CONSIDERED IN THE SESSION SO. I THE GOVERNOR AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MAYES AS MAY SIGN EXECUTIVE ORDER AND ELEVEN NINETEEN WHICH ESTABLISHES THE FUTURE OF WORK COMMISSION. I AM NOT IS SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON A NUMBER OF THINGS INCLUDING AUTOMATION OF JOBS ANDEXPANDED A AYE CAPABILITIES. I AB NINE SEVENTY SIX CHAO WHICH YOUR YOUR BELL REFERENCES CREATES AN A I COMMISSION. AB FIVE NINETY FOUR AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS WHICH IS REQUIRING THE DIRECTOR OF C. D. T. TO APPOINT A CHIEF A AYE OFFICER. ENVELOP STRATEGIC PLANS AT CENTER AT AND I GUESS HELP ME UNDERSTAND HOW. WHAT IS IN THIS BILL? IS. INCREMENTAL TO ALL THAT OTHER. EITHER CURRENT OR OR PROPOSED LEGISLATION AND I THINK FOR ME YOU KNOW THAT THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL WE AREN'T A POLICY COMMITTEE IN THE SAME WAY THAT OTHER POLICY COMMITTEES IN A LOOK AT THAT. IDEA WE'RE NOT JUST LOOKING AT GOOD IDEAS THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF THIS COMMITTEE. IS TO INCREASE IN EFFICIENCY AND THE OPERATIONS OF STATE GOVERNMENT IS WHEN I LOOK AT ALL THOSE BELLS AND ALL THOSE LAWS I'M LIKE WHY IN THE WORLD WE NEED. FIVE NEW LAWS TO DO THE SAME THING -- SO WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND HOW YOU FEEL THAT THIS IS A UNIQUE AND DIFFERENTIATED PIECE OF LEGISLATION -- WHEN COMPARED TO THAT THAT LANDSCAPE? RIGHT SO. I KNOW YOU AND I HAVE. A DISCUSS A LITTLE BIT OF ABOUT THIS LAST NIGHT BUT WE HAVE WORKED WITH -- CHARLES COMMITTEE TO PUT IN AMENDMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DOES NOT -- OVERLAP OR IT'S IT'S NOT DUPLICATIVE OF OTHER BILLS SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU MENTIONED THAT -- HE'S CREATING AN A I COMMISSION FROM MY BILL DOES NOT CREATE NAY I'M IN A I'M MISSION IT JUST TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION WHAT THEIR FINDINGS ARE. AND AS A SECTION THREE STATES -- THIS SECTION TWO OF THIS ACTUAL BECOME OPERATIVE ONLY IF ASSEMBLY BILL NINE SOME SIX WHICH IS THE CHILD BILL. OF THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY REGULAR SESSION IS AN ACTIVE AND BECOMES OPERATIVE IN WHICH SECTION IN WHICH CASE SECTION ONE OF THIS ACTUAL NOT BECOME. OPERATIVE SO WE PUT MEASURES THAT WE PUT AMENDMENTS IN PLACE SO THAT DOESN'T IT IT -- TO IT CLARIFIES THAT IT'S NOT DUPLICATIVE. AND THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT PORTIONS OF THE THE BILL OF DIFFERENT BILLS ARE ALL PORTIONS OF THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION. AND SO I FEEL LIKE IT'S MORE ALL OF THE DIFFERENT BILLS ARE. COMPLEMENTARY TO EACH OTHER. AND I ALSO TALKED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF TECH. REGARDING THIS BILL AND I SAID HEY WHAT WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT WHICH AGENCIES -- SHOULD BE -- A TACKLE WITH THOSE TO BE A A STRATEGIC PLAN AND THEY SAID OURS. AND SO THEY THEY ARE FULLY ON BOARD WITH -- OF MY PLAN OKAY. STEPS OUT THE SALAS BILL THAT IS CREATING A DIRECTOR WITH IN SORRY THE CHIEF A AYE OFFICER WITH AND THE CD T.. WHO WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR A STRATEGIC PLAN FOR A AYE? IT WOULD BE THE DIRECTOR OF TECHNOLOGY SHALL DEVISE A STRATEGIC. PLAN DESIGNED TO EIGHT DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES SO NOT A SPECIFIC. A I SO IT. IT IT'S NOT OF DEPENDENT UPON THE PASSAGE OF OF HIS BILL OKAY. RIGHT THE THOSE ARE MY CONCERNS AS I SAID I'D. CERTAINLY AND SUPER SUPPORTIVE OF THE INTENT TO THE BALLOT PRESHOW YOUR FOCUS ON THE SUBJECT THINK IT'S SUPER IMPORTANT. MY REASON FOR BEING A NO TODAY IS SIMPLY I LIKE IS THAT I THINK IT CREATES REDUNDANT REQUIREMENTS AND REDUNDANT COSTS AND IN THE CONTEXT OF CHAIRING A COMMITTEE WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE GOVERNMENT MORE EFFICIENT. I CAN'T WRAP MY HEAD AROUND THAT I AM I CAN ALSO HAVE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION COMMENT ON ON OKAY I WOULD BE GREAT THANK YOU -- THE DIFFERENT BILLS THAT YOU HAVE REFERENCE ARE ALL SUPPORTED BY THE COMMISSION THEY COME FROM -- DIFFERENT RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE COMMISSION IS MADE -- AND SO WE SEE THEM AS COMPLEMENTARY TO EACH OTHER. OKAY GREAT THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS -- UP. I WANTED TO IT I YOU COULD YOU CLARIFY I THINK WITH RESPECT TO THE DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN THE THE OTHER BILLS. BUT I I JUST I WANTED. TO AT LEAST COM AT THAT LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION. IN MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN. UP ABOUT EFFICIENCIES AND STREAMLINING AND FIGURING OUT WAYS TO DO THIS KIND OF STUFF BETTER SO IT SEEMS TO ME IT FITS. FAIRLY SIGNIFICANTLY. TO THE TASK OF OF THIS COMMITTEE AND SO YOU DID SAY THAT IN THE COMMISSION'S JUDGMENT THESE. OTHER BILLS ARE COMPLIMENTARY AND ARE NOT. DUPLICATIVE AND ARE IN YOUR VIEW. NECESSARY FOR THE APPROPRIATE. APPROACH TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE COMMISSION HAS MADE IT MY UNDERSTAND IT CORRECTLY AND BECAUSE WE JUST SEE -- THE IMPLICATIONS THAT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CAN HAVE ON THE STATE AND CALIFORNIANS WE WE FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT THESE BILLS YEAH RIGHT.

SIX MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS -- PLEASED TO PRESENT SB -- SIX THIS IS A BILL THAT CRISIS SIMPLY -- A CENTRALIZED DATABASE OF STATE -- AND LOCALLY OWNED SURPLUS AND VACANT LAND AND PROPERTIES IDENTIFIED. FOR HOUSING CONSTRUCTION OR CONSTRUCTION SO WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE A CENTRALIZED. ONE STOP SHOP DATABASE -- WE HAVE NO SILVER BULLET ON THE HOUSING CRISIS BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO DO THINGS THAT FACILITATE -- OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING ONE OF THE SIMPLE THINGS WE CAN DO IS. TO USE WHATEVER TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE TO CREATE A ONE STOP SHOP CENTRALIZED DATABASE THAT WOULD. PROVIDE ANYBODY INTERESTED IN BUILDING HOUSING PRIVATE SECTOR NON PROFITS -- OTHER GROUPS -- TO HAVE A PLACE THEY CAN GO. TO START THE PROCESS OF GETTING -- LAND FOR THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- LANCASTER BERRIER TO BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING SB SIX PROPOSES -- TO TAKE INFORMATION IT'S KIND OF ALREADY THERE. YOU'LL SEE IT THAT WAY. IT'S ALREADY THERE THIS INFORMATION IS THERE BUT IT'S NOT ACCUMULATE IN A WILL AND ONE LOCATION. SO WE HAVE WITNESSES SUPPORTING THIS BILL IT'S A SIMPLE BILL I'LL TURN IT OVER TO A PARK AND SALAS AND GIVE YOU THEY'LL GIVE YOU A PERSPECTIVE AND PEDRO GOBBLED. PERSPECTIVE ON FROM THE INDUSTRY AND LAND TRUST -- SIDE OF THINGS THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE PAUL GUNS ALL THIS HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE IRVINE COMMUNITY LAND TRUST WE ARE ONE OF TWENTY FIVE WHEN TRUST THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT PROVIDES -- PERMANENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- TO THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES -- THE WAY ENTRUST MODELS EAGER TO GROW IN THE STATE AND WE'VE SEEN MANY BARRIERS AND FROM WHEN IT COMES TO TRYING TO DEVELOP THESE THESE PROPERTIES -- THIS BILL WILL DO A GREAT JOB OF BEING ABLE CENTRALIZE ALL OF THIS INFORMATION GIVE US SOME DIRECTION. AND ALLOW US TO BE ABLE TO OVERCOME ALL THOSE BARRIERS IT'S REALLY A VERY SIMPLE BILL BUT HAS WILL HAVE A GREAT IMPACT AND FOR THOSE REASONS WERE IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING CHAIR PETRIE-NORRIS MY NAME IS PATRICK OF ALMOST THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WE ARE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION CELEBRATING OUR FORTIETH YEAR THIS YEAR. AND WE'RE HERE IN SUPPORT OF SB SIX BECAUSE WE SAY IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING THERE THREE CRITICAL COMPONENTS MONEY LAND AND POLITICAL WILL ON THIS HELPS TO ADDRESS THE LAND COMPONENT OF IT -- ASSN THE REBELS -- ALLUDED TO JURISDICTIONS ARE ALREADY REQUIRED TO IDENTIFY SITES THAT ARE APPROPRIATE FOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN THEIR HOUSING ELEMENTS. BUT THIS INFORMATION IS NOT THIS IN ANY CENTRALIZED DATABASE AND SB SIX WILL FOR THE FIRST TIME. BRING THAT AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL -- IN FACT THE ASSOCIATION OF BAY AREA GOVERNMENTS IN THE BAY AREA ALREADY DID A SIMILAR EFFORT -- AND IT WAS INCREDIBLY ILLUMINATING TO SEE WHAT SITES JURISDICTIONS HAD ALREADY IDENTIFIED FOR HOUSING. AND WHETHER THEY COULDBE PUT TO IMMEDIATE USE AND WE THINK HAVING THIS TOOL WILL HELP SHAVE OFF SOME VALUABLE TIME OFF THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS TO HELP GET PEOPLE HOUSED. FASTER -- AFFORDABLY HOUSE FASTER IN OUR STATE AND SO ON FOR THOSE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST DRIVE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES HERE IN SUPPORT OF MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS A JULIE SNYDER WITH EQUITY ADVOCATES REPRESENTING HOUSING CALIFORNIA -- HOUSING CALIFORNIA REPRESENTS ONE OF THE MOST SOPHISTICATED NONPROFIT DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITIES IN THE NATION. ARE WE'RE VERY PROUD OF WHAT OUR MEMBERS TO YOU HERE -- AND WE WOULD AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN SAID ABOUT ALLOWING A MUCH EASIER ACCESS KNOWING WHERE SITES ARE AVAILABLE A NUMBER OF NONPROFIT DEVELOPERS ARE NOW EXPANDING. OUTSIDE OF THEIR ORIGINAL COMMUNITY AND LOOKING FOR SITES IS VERY CHALLENGING IF YOU'RE TRYING TO YOU KNOW YOUR JAMBOREE HOUSING IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND NOW YOU'RE EXPANDING IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SO THIS. THE DATABASE LIKE THIS AS AS PETER SAID WILL SHAVE REALLY VALUABLE TIME OFF OF THAT EFFORT -- AND MAKE IT EASIER TO AT LEAST SECURE THE LAND THAT WE NEED THANK YOU. GREAT I ANY OTHER WITNESSES HERE IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SCENE NINE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MS QUIRK SILVA -- MISTER BAILEY JUST AYE IN HOUSING AND I BELIEVE THIS BILL IS DOUBLE REFERRED. YES -- BECAUSE MANY OF THESE TOPICS CROSS BOTH OF THEM ACCOUNTABILITY AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I PARTICULARLY LIKE ABOUT THIS BILL. IS I HAVE BEEN ON ACCOUNT AMID ACCOUNTABILITY COMMITTEE. FOR LEAVE THIS IS MY FOURTH YEAR AND SOMETIMES WE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE DON'T TAKE TO KIND OF STREAMLINE AND SO FORTH BUT OTHER TIMES -- WERE FORCED TO AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL ALTHOUGH WE SAY IT'S A SIMPLE BILL IT'S REALLY. ON A MUCH MORE THAN THAT BECAUSE OF ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE KNOW IS IT'S NOT JUST EACH COMMUNITY OR EACH CITY. OR COUNTY THAT IS NOW. FORCED TO LOOK AT THIS A VERY SERIOUS TOPIC OF A HOMELESS CRISIS. BUT IT'S ALSO ONCE WE PUT FORWARD THE TOOLS WHETHER IT BE WITH FUNDING WHETHER IT BE WITH -- VARIOUS TYPES OF GRANTS -- SO FORTH IT'S ALSO GIVING THE TOOLS TO THE LOCAL I. ENTITIES TO NAVIGATE THEM AND THE MORE WORK IT TAKES TO NAVIGATE WHETHER IT'S FOR A GRANT WHETHER IT'S DEFINED -- LAND THAT IS AVAILABLE THAT JUST ADDS TIME LET ALONE ALL THE OTHER BARRIERS BUT AN EXAMPLE IS AND ONE OF PARK THE MY AREA. THEY ARE MOVING FORWARD ON A A MERGING STATE SHELTER AND BECAUSE THERE WAS QUITE A BIT OF OUTCRY -- ONE OF THE WAYS THE COUNCIL OF MOVE FORWARD WAS INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT THE ORIGINAL SITE THEY HAD SHOWS AND THEY ASK THE CITY MANAGER. TO LOOK FOR ANOTHER SPOT. THAT THE CITY OWNED AND WITHIN A MEETING HE CAME BACK WITH A PARCEL THAT. REALLY WASN'T ON ANYBODY'S RADAR THE PUBLIC WAS MUCH HAPPIER WITH THAT. AND NOW SUPPORT IT BECAUSE IT WAS A PIECE OF LAND THAT REALLY WAS ON ANYBODY SO RADAR SO I BELIEVE THIS DATABASE WILL ALLOW NOT ONLY LIKE YOU SAY DEVELOPERS BUT THE PUBLIC. COMMUNITIES LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES COUNTY AND GOING IN AND KIND OF HAVE A MAP FOR NAVIGATION OF WAIT WE REALLY DIDN'T EXPECT THIS. FOUR YEARS AGO ON ACCOUNTABILITY WE WERE ACTUALLY DOING THE OPPOSITE OF THIS WE WERE OF TRYING TO GET RID OF LAND -- THAT WAS NOT USED IN THE WAY IT WAS A ORIGINALLY A DETERMINED CAMPS UP IN DIFFERENT AREAS I KNOW IT WAS A ONE OF A YOUTH CAMP IN OUR AREA IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THAT WAS BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED DRAMATICALLY SO I THINK THIS IS A VERY. BIG BILL NOT A LITTLE BILL SO I MOVE THE BILL FORWARD. I'M. RECENTLY I HAD A MEETING WITH LOS ANGELES CONTROLLER RUN GIRLFRIEND AND HE HAS UNDERTAKEN EXACTLY THIS WHERE THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND IT'S PROVING TO BE A VERY USEFUL TOOL ALREADY SO. I'M EXCITED TO SEE THIS EXPANDED AND I WILL HAPPILY SECOND THE BILL. I WILL SIMPLY. ADD THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AS YOU SAID THERE IS NO ONE SO FAR PAUL IT TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING CRISIS BUT THIS DOES SEEM LIKE A REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE OF THE PUZZLE SO SO THANK YOU. I WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES -- THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS FROM THE MEMBERS -- I'M EXCITED TO MAKE THIS BILL WORKABLE THING TO SAVE MONEY AND TIME AND DEVELOPING HOUSING AND I THINK IT'S GONNA. HELP THE LAND BANKERS THE HOUSING LAND BANKERS. KIND OF LIKE WE DO OPEN SPACE YOU KNOW WE WE GO OUT WE BY THIS OPEN SPACE WE HAVE OPEN SPACE TRUST AND ALL THAT. I THINK THIS WILL HELP OUR LAND BANKERS FOR HOUSING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING SAWYER CHEN AYE VOTE I THINK IT'S A VERY PROGRESSIVE -- CONCEPT TO HAVE -- THE STATE ALLOW THESE THINGS TO HAPPEN SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU I SECRETARY FOR HIM PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS A REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS PETRIE-NORRIS HI PETRIE-NORRIS I PATTERSON. BURKE. LACKEY.
