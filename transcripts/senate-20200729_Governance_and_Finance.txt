IN WE ARE CLOSING THE RULES ALRIGHT LADIES AND GENTLEMAN THE CENTER HERTZBERG SHOW IS JUST ABOUT TO CONCLUDE WE HAVE ONE MORE BILL THOUGH ONE MORE BILL AND THAT IS- ARE SIX ITEM ON OUR ACTION AGENDA TODAY THIS IS AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FOUR TWENTY ONE WHICH WE PULLED FROM CONSENT. IS MAJORITY LEADER THE FLOOR IS YOURS ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRK. THANK YOU THE- SHERMAN YOU KNOW ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IN THIS JOB IS WE OFTEN HAVE COMPETING INTERESTS. BOTH LEGITIMATE AND WE GOT TO MAKE TOUGH DECISIONS. HERE WE'VE GOT DISTURBED TREMENDOUS DEMAND FOR WILD FIRES. AND THE IMPACT IT HAS IN THE FACT THAT WE RELIED SO HEAVILY ON WIRELESS SYSTEMS THESE MACRO TOWERS IS BIG TOWERS. THAT OPERATE YOUR CELL PHONES SO THERE'S A FIRE THERE'S SOME KIND OF EVENT YOU NEED ACCESS TO. YOUR TELEPHONE TECHNOLOGY. ON THE OTHER HAND WE'VE GOT ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. AND SO WHAT THIS BILL DEALS WITH IN MY JUDGMENT IS. GIVING AN EXPEDITED PROCESS TO INSTALL BACKUP POWER FOR THESE BIG STATIONS AYE IN MY DAY I USED TO DO SOLAR AND WIND AS OPPOSED TO ANY KIND OF FOSSIL FUEL BACKUP POWER FOR THESE KINDS OF STATIONS AROUND THE GLOBE BUT I'M QUITE FAMILIAR WITH THIS ISSUE. AND SO WHAT WHAT IT DOES TO PUT TO SIXTY A SHOT CLOCK IF YOU WILL TO ALLOW FOR THE APPROVAL OF THIS SO THAT WE CAN- IS THE WILDFIRES IF YOU KNOW THREATEN US AND THE LIKE. WILL ENABLE RAPID THE POINT EMERGENCY STANDBY GENERATORS WHICH OF COURSE AS WE ALL KNOW IS VITAL TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY AND WELFARE TO ENSURE THAT CONSUMERS- MAINTAIN ACCESS TO NINE ONE ONE. AND SO THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSION I KNOW THAT THIS ASSEMBLY OR CORPORATE STILL WILLING TO. DISCUSS ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS AS THIS MOVES ALONG TO THE PROCESS. BUT IT DOES APPLY TO MACRO TOWERS DOES NOT APPLY TO THIS THE SMALLER FIVE G. OR A DEALS ORDER SMALL CELL TOWERS. AND GET YOU KNOW WHAT DOES APPLY STATE WIDE WHICH IS ONE OF THE CONSIDERATIONS HERE. BUT CLEARLY THERE HAVE BEEN CHALLENGES ALL ACROSS THE STATE IF YOU LOOK FOR EXAMPLE AT THE- THERE WAS AN ORDER THAT WAS DONE I'M TRYING TO FIND IT TO THE ORDER THAT DEALT WITH THIS IN TWO THOUSAND. AND NINETEEN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE P. S. P. S. ORDER WHICH IMPACTED COMMUNITY STABILIZE. FOR THE GETS A BALANCED APPROACH DEALING WITH SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES DEALING WITH THE ISSUES OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT. BUT OVERRIDING PUBLIC SAFETY ACCESS TO NINE ONE ONE.

PROVIDERS ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK HAS WORKED DILIGENTLY WITH MANY STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THE CPUC COMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERSAND LOCAL GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION. IN RESOLVING ANY CONCERNS WITH THE SCOPE AND JURISDICTION OF THE VERY NARROWLY AILORED MEASURE. TO EXPEDITE THE DEPLOYMENT OF BACKUP POWER SOLUTIONS.

YOU KNOW THE NOTION ABOUT- WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH. CURRENT LAW SB FIVE SIXTY MANDATES THAT COMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS PROVIDE RELEVANT SITUATIONAL INFORMATION DURING THE OUTAGES TO PUBLIC SAFETY STAKEHOLDERS SB SIX SEVENTY MANDATES THE REPORTING OF NETWORK OUTAGES TO CAL OVER YES FOR WIRELINE WIRELESS WHICH IS HERE VOICE SERVICES WITHIN SIXTY MINUTES OF DISCOVERY. IT'S MY JUDGMENT IN TERMS OF THE ARGUMENT THAT'S BEING MADE THAT TO ADD A PROVISION THAT SAYS CONSISTENT IS NOTHING MORE THAN ADDING A PROVISION INVITES LITIGATION. IT OFTEN LITIGATION IS IMPORTANT WHAT YOU WANT TO INVITE THE JUDICIAL BRANCH TO DECIDE ON THINGS LIKE THIS. BUT WE'RE FACING EMERGENCIES THAT'S WHAT THIS BILLS ABOUT WILDFIRES PEOPLE HAVING ACCESS TO NINE ONE ONE THAT'S WHY YOU HEARD SO MANY FIREFIGHTERS IN PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICIALS STAND IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. OFTEN IN THE BALANCE THAT I TALKED ABOUT OF THE OPENING HERE THAT WE HAVE TO MEET WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO MEET THESE KINDS OF EMERGENCIES INVITING LITIGATION BUT JUST SIMPLY ALLOWS PARTIES TO THEN GO TO A COURT AND SAYING THERE'S AN INCONSISTENCY. WHICH THE COURTS MANDATED TO TAKE BECAUSE WE SAID IN THE LEGISLATION IS NOTHING MORE IN MY JUDGMENT THAN A DELAY IN THE PROCESS. AND I WOULD ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE OF THIS IMPORTANT MISSION.

IN SHAPE TO MOVE FORWARD THANK YOU CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SO MUCH. AB THIRTY THREE TELL TWELVE PROVIDES IN THEIR EXEMPTION- TO THE CURRENT ANNEXATION LAW TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF UC MERCED AND- IF I MIGHT ALL SHARE WITH THE COMMITTEE A BRIEF HISTORY. OF THE CAMPUS- IN MY HOMETOWN AND THE GOOD MAJORITY LEADER AND FORMER SPEAKER- CENTER HERTZBERG- WAS ACTUALLY INSTRUMENTAL IN BRINGING THE TENTH AND MOST RECENT UNIVERSITY OF MERCED CAMPUS. TO REALITY AND- IT HAS BEEN AN EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESS STORY YOU KNOW A MAJORITY OF FIRST IN THEIR FAMILY- TO GO TO COLLEGE STUDENTS- A MAJORITY MINORITY CAMPUS JUST- RIGHT FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. FOR YOUNG PEOPLE ACROSS CALIFORNIA NOT TO MENTION THE YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY BUT THE WAY WE ULTIMATELY GOT THAT CAMPUS CITED A MERCED SOMEWHAT. I HAD TO DO WITH THE STORY OF THE VIRGINIA SMASH SMITH- TRUST WHICH OWNED A RANCH IN MERCED COUNTY DONATED THE LAND TO THE STATE FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CAMPUS. AND I MYSELF AM A RECIPIENT OF THE SCHOLARSHIP FROM THE VIRGINIA SMITH TRUST WHICH WAS A SCHOLARSHIP- TAKEN FROM THE RANCH PROCEEDS AND GIVEN TO STUDENTS OF MERCED HIGH SCHOOL FOR MANY MANY YEARS. A SCHOLARSHIP THE CONTINUES TO THIS DAY. AND PART OF THE- GOAL THERE WAS TO DONATE LED TO THE STATE TO BUILD THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IN THE VALLEY. AND THEN WITH THE SURROUNDING LAND- STILL OWNED A MAINTAINED BY THE TRUST. TO DEVELOP IT AND- OBVIOUSLY. GET FUNDS TO FURTHER SUPPORT YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE VALLEY IN THE CITY AND HOPEFULLY LATER COUNTY OF MERCED FOR COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIPS. SO MANY YEARS LATER THROUGH A GREAT RECESSION THROUGH THE STATE CUTTING FUNDING TO HIGHER EDUCATION AND- STATE MEAN THE GROSS REALLY OF THE CAMPUSFOR MANY MANY YEARS WE HAVE REACHED TEN THOUSAND STUDENTS IT'S A BEAUTIFUL CAMPUS IT'S ON A SMALLER FOOTPRINT THAN WE ORIGINALLY HAD ENVISIONED AS WE DONATED THOUSANDS OF ACRES- INTO CONSERVATION AROUND THE CAMPUS. BUT THE CAMPUS WAS CITED BECAUSE OF THIS FREE LAND ON THE TRUST- FOR MILES AND-THOUSANDS OF ACRES AWAY FROM THE CITY PERCENT. AND SO THE SURROUNDING DEVELOPMENT OF THAT CAMPUS THAT WOULD FEED BOTH THAT TRUST AND ALSO CREATE CAMPUS LIFE AN OPPORTUNITY STUDENT FACULTY HOUSING HAS NOT COME TO FRUITION- AS THE CITY. THROUGH THE GREAT RECESSION SLOWLY HAS BUILT OUT LET ME REMIND THE MEMBERS DURING THE GREAT RECESSION AND HOUSING CRISIS MERCED WAS ON THE TOP TEN LIST IN THE COUNTRY. NOT IN THE STATE IN THE COUNTRY. I JUST HIT BY THE HOUSING CRISIS SO THERE ARE A LOT OF REASONS THAT GROWTH HAS. NOT OCCURRED IN THE WAY WE HAD HOPED OVER THE YEARS AND WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IS ALLOW THE CAMPUS ITSELF A STATE INVESTMENT TO BE ANNEXED INTO THE CITY. AND THEN LET THE CITY AND THE CAMPUS GROW TOGETHER WHICH WILL AFFORD A STUDENT AND FACULTY LIFE OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL AS FULFILL THE PROMISE OF THE VIRGINIA SMITH. A SCHOLARSHIP TRUST IN A EXPEDITED FASHION WHICH IS THE GOAL THE PUBLIC POLICY GOAL OF THE BILL AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION HAPPY TO TAKE. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ARE RIGHT HERE ANY CONCERNS THIS AFTERNOON. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND SOMEONE WE'RE WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS AND- IT'S VERY PERSONAL FOR YOU- IN SO MANY IN THE COMMUNITY SO GRATEFUL YOU'RE BRINGING THIS FOURTEEN FINALLY- ABLE TO BRING SOME CLOSURE TO THIS IS WELL.

MISTER THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WANT TO LEND MY INDICATION OF SUPPORT. ALONG WITH THAT OF. CENTER HERTZBERG. HAVING BEEN RAISED IN THAT VALLEY HAS. BEEN PRETTY. WELL ACQUAINTED. WITH THE GROWING OF. RIVERSIDE COUNTY THOSE. FOLLOW THE VALLEY COUNTIES IN FACT. IT THE CHAO. THAT THEY HAVE FACE. OVER THE YEARS I'VE WORKED WITH STE NOW SENATOR GALGIANI THAT SHE HAS ADVOCATED FOR THE UNIVERSITY THERE AND ASSEMBLYMAN GREAT. AND ALSO VERY DIRECTLY THE CURRENT PRESIDENT FRESNO STATE UNIVERSITY JOE CASTRO SPENT A NUMBER OF YEARS IN MERCED WORKING TRYING TO WORK OUT ALL THE DIFFICULTIES TO ENSURE THAT THAT CAMPUS WOULD BE CITED. IT IS NOW CITED IN I WILL INDEED IT'S VERY CRITICAL I BELIEVE TO THE GROWTH INTELLECTUAL GROWTH ECONOMIC GROWTH OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY THIS SEEMS LIKE A- AN ITEM THAT NEEDS TO BE WORKED OUT. AND THEY ARE IN THE PROCESS OF ACHIEVING IT I THINK WITH A LOT OF WORK ON BEHALF OF THE AUTHOR I COMMEND THEM IN OTHER THAN MY SUPPORT. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER NEAR SERVER TO GO TO THE VICE CHAIR THEY WERE TO GO TO CENTER ABOUT MISTER VICE CHAIR. THANK MEASURE OF BEING SOMEONE WHO- SERVED ON THE ORANGE COUNTY LEFT- AND- DISSIPATED AND CAL AFTER OVER ONE IT'S GOOD TO SEE THAT CAL I'VE GOES. AT LEAST PLAYING OFF OF THEIR OPPOSITION BUT- BY MY BRIEFING TELLS ME THAT TO DATE MERCED LEFT COKE MERCED CITY COUNCIL MERCED COUNTY. UC MERCED AND THE UC MERCED CHANCELLOR HAVE HAVE TAKEN NO POSITION ON THE BILL. SO THAT HAS ME A LITTLE CONFUSED SO MAYBE THE FIRST QUESTION WOULD BE WHY. THE CENTER I'M. FURTHER SOUTH AND THEN TO COULD YOU JUST EXPLAIN THE HISTORY OF WHY YOU NEEDED TO GO THROUGH A LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION AS OPPOSED TO A LOCAL SOLUTION. NUMBER. THANK YOU A CENTER FOR THE QUESTION WELL THE FIRST AND FOREMOST CAN OPPOSITION SPOTS THAT IS THE COMPLICATIONS OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS RUBIO OF CERTAINLY MADE IT MORE DIFFICULT- IN ALL OF OUR ALL OF HIS GOVERNMENT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH SUPPORT LETTERS AND ACTIVITIES THAT OTHERWISE ARE FAIRLY NORMAL COURSE OF NORMAL BUSINESS. THE HISTORY OF IT IS WHAT I WAS GETTING IN MY OPENING IS THAT THE OF THE STATE MADE THIS DECISION EFFECTIVE CAMPUS SEVEN MILES ABOUT FOUR MILES OUTSIDE OF TOWN SEVEN MILES FROM THE MOST DEAD CENTER- PORTIONS OF TOWN. AND THEY DID THAT BECAUSE THIS LAND WAS DONATED BY THE- BRITISH MISTRUST. AND BY CITING THE LAND OUT THERE. COMBINED WITH THE HOUSING CRISIS THAT WE WENT INTO IN THE MID TWO THOUSANDS THERE WAS- ESTIMATE GROWTH TOWARDS THE CAMPUS NO GROWTH COULD OCCUR AROUND THE CAMPUS UNTIL THE CITY MEETS AS I'M SURE YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH HAVING SERVED- INTO LAUGHTER POSITION. SO IN ORDER TO FACILITATE- GROSS NOW TO CREATE BOTH A CAMPUS LIFE AND ALSO ADDRESS THE HOUSING ISSUE BECAUSE ONE THING THAT WAS TOUCHED ON BRIEF IN SOME OF THE OPPOSITION COMMENTS IS KIND OF THE FACT ON SOME THE OTHER COMMUNITY SERVER SIDE. AMBER SAID AS A 1% VACANCY RATE. RIGHT THAT LIKE MANY PARTS OF CALIFORNIA ALTHOUGH I THINK PEOPLE OFTEN TIMES OVERLOOKED US BECAUSE WERE RURAL- AND WERE SMALL BUT WE'RE FACING THE SAME HOUSING SHORTAGES IF NOT IN SOME CASES WORST BECAUSE BEING A COMMUNITY THAT'S WITHIN. YOU KNOW A TWO TO TWO AND A HALF HOUR DRIVE OF MOST PORTIONS THE BAY AREA. LIVING IN THE BAY AREA HAS BECOME SO EXTRAORDINARILY EXPENSIVE FOR MOST WORKING CALIFORNIANS AS YOU KNOW THE TAPE. OUT INTO MASTER LOS BANOS MERCED CAN IMPACT OUR HOUSING CRISIS EVEN WORSE. ON TOP OF THAT WE ADDED TEN THOUSAND STUDENTS AS WELL AS A SUPPORT STAFF AND FACULTY. FOR THOSE TEN THOUSAND STUDENTS. AND SO WE'RE REALLY IN A BREAKING POINT ON HAVING TO HAVE STUDENT HOUSING TO FREE UP HOUSING FOR OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY. TO ALSO CREATE SOME CAMPUS LIFE. IT HAS BEEN DIFFICULT OVER THE LAST DECADE TO EVEN RECRUIT. FACULTY TO THE CAMPUS COULD YOU BRING FACULTY THE CAMPUS YOU'VE GOT. A BACK YOU KNOW SOME CAMPUS LIFE ON A SMALLER FOOTPRINT BECAUSE THE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. AND NOTHING GOING ON AROUND IT MAYBE MAYBE MORE FIVE MILES AWAY REMEMBER GRAY MAYBE I DIDN'T ASK THE QUESTION THAT I AGO HAD RISEN I'M JUST KIND OF CURIOUS WHY DIDN'T MERCED LAUGH GO. THE TODAY HAVE HEARINGS TODAY DO A- A GETTING READY TO DO YOUR WILL COME HISTORY AS WELL WHY IT JUST IT JUST SEEMS LIKE A NO BRAINER THAT'S WHY. I'M JUST MISSING THE NEED TO COME HERE AS OPPOSED TO. LAUGH GO IN THE BOARD APPROVING IT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IT'S UNINCORPORATED AREA IN. A RECEIPT THE CITY SHOULD BE THE RIGHT. I MEAN I WORK REALLY HARD TO ANNEX. UNINCORPORATED AREAS IN THE CITY'S AYE WE DON'T HAVE. RURAL AREA EIGHTY MARCH KENNY BUT WE HAVE ALL THESE LITTLE ISLANDS. SO I'M I'M JUST MISSING THAT PART OF THE STORY AND I APOLOGIZE THAT. I JUST DIDN'T LAUGHTER DID DISCUSS THE BILL THEY DIDN'T TAKE A POSITION- SUPPORT OR OPPOSE. AND I THINK THE ANSWER TO SOME OF THE CITY IN THIS TO BE MY FINAL POINT ON WHY WE ARE WHERE WE'RE AT- IS THE POLITICS OF CITY GOVERNMENT. LAUGH GO. AHEAD. THAT ALL TOGETHER AND SOMETIMES YOU GET INACTION. WHICH IS PRECISELY WHY STEPPED IN. AT THE STATE LEVEL SAID WELL IT'S IN EVERYBODY'S COLLECTIVE INTEREST TO HAVE THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WHICH THE STATE INVESTMENT MADE BY. OUR INSTITUTION. ANNEXED INTO THE CITY THE GROWTH THAT OCCURS THEN AROUND IT FOLLOWING THE RULES AND PROCEDURES OF. LAUGHTER AND LOCAL ORDINANCES- WILL BE WHAT WHAT WILL BE AND WE CAN WORK THROUGH THOSE POLITICS BUT WE WORK. BASICALLY HAMSTRUNG- IN MOVING FORWARD- IS DIFFERENT YOU KNOW ENTITIES HAD DIFFERENT OPINIONS FOR. SOME POLICY AND PROBABLY SOME POLITICAL REASONS RIGHT SO THIS IS MY WAY OF SERVING- YOU KNOW THE STATE'S INTEREST AS WELL AS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS INTERESTING KIND OF. SPURRING THAT ACTIVITY TO MOVE FORWARD. YOU'RE SHOWING LEADERSHIP ON ON A MAJOR CONCERN. SO WHAT I'M MISSING AT ALL IN WITH THIS QUESTION. IS AFTER THIS A PER ON THIS FLOOR AND GOES TO THE GOV IS THE GOVERNOR TO GET ALL A LETTER AND MAY EVEN A THREAT OF LET. FROM THE CITY OR FROM THE UNIVERSITY AND SAYING THIS THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT ANSWER AND THEY JUST KIND OF. THOUGHT MAYBE THE BILL WOULDN'T. GET THIS FAR SIDE. I AM JUST WONDERING ABOUT SOME KIND OF SURPRISE AND I APOLOGIZE FOR. ASKING IN THAT VEIN BUT AGAIN IT IT SHOWS THAT I DON'T HAVE ALL THE DATA I APPRECIATE THAT SIR VERY DIRECT AND- WE GET IT. I WOULDN'T ANTICIPATE ANY LITIGATION I THINK THERE IS BROAD BASED SUPPORT IN ALL OF THOSE ENTITIES THAT YOU'VE RAISED I THINK THE REASONS PEOPLE HAVEN'T NECESSARILY STEP FORWARD IN. FULL SUPPORT AT THIS JUNCTURE BUT I DON'T THINK I THINK EVERYONE SEES THIS IN OUR COMMUNITY'S COLLECTIVE INTEREST- I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE THAT YOU WILL NOT SEE THAT OCCUR. ON THE GOVERNOR'S DESK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSUME MEMBER GRAY FOR A LIVING ASK QUESTIONS PREACHING. INTEREST THANK YOU AND BEFORE WE GO TO CENTER. IN A GREAT PLEASE PUT BACK AS I KNOW THIS IS A AND YOU SHOULD YOU'VE BEEN. STRUGGLING WITH FOR LONG HE LAUGHED ALONG SPECIFICALLY PROHIBITS ANY. TEAR THAT IS. CONNECTED TO THIS BY A- WHICH IS WHAT OF THE MAIN DRIVER A DAY. WILD AS AN AUTHOR THE BILL AUTHORIZED BUT NOT RE. WHICH IS SO CRITICAL RIGHT TO BE A TO GET THIS DONE IN NO THIS IS BEEN A REAL HANG UP AS WELL AS A MEMBER GREAT PLEASE FISH BACK ON THE- FUNDING FOR. BUT I THINK ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL OF THIS. SO THE. FRIEND A FLEXIBLE GIVEN THE EXACT WE'RE NOT AND YET ANYONE PROCEED IN X. FORM BRIDGES OPENING A THE OP AND JACK WORKED. WITH COUNTIES AND LW TO ME SURE AND I THINK ULTIMATELY THAT'S WE GOT THE ASSOCIATE FROM ABOUT IS THAT WE HAVE HAD THAT CLOSE WORKING RELATIONSHIP ALL ROWING IN THE SAME DIRECTION- AND APPRECIATE YOU APPRECIATE YOU POINT THAT OUT THANK YOU SO MUCH AS A NUMBER THAT'S GOING TO SENATOR ABOUT PLEASE THANK YOU MUCH YOUR WORK ON THE UNIVERSITY THERE I'M INTERESTED IN THE TOWN DOWN.

RECALL WHEN WE DID HAVE SOMEONE THAT. CLAIM THAT WE VIOLATED THE BROWN ACTED IT WAS USUALLY BY SOMEONE WHO WITHIN FILE. SOME KIND OF LAWSUIT THAT WITH VIOLATED IN THAT MAYBE THE REMEDY WOULD BE THAT WE- TAKE A SEMINAR FOR A QUICK COURSE OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE BUT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN VERY OFTEN SO I'M- TRYING TO. THINK ABOUT WHAT I RAN INTO BUT IN IN IN THE- BRIEFING THAT I HAVE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER A MALL AND I DON'T HAVE ANY EXAMPLES LIKE THAT WERE SOMEONE. WHILE THE A I WAS STATING THAT YOU VIOLATED THE BROWN ACT BECAUSE YOU USED FACEBOOK OR YOU USE TWITTER OR- AND SO ARM I WAS JUST CURIOUS. IF YOU COULD GIVE ME. THE HISTORY OF WHAT MOTIVATED YOU TO DO THIS WHAT WHAT WHAT TRANSPIRED THAT. CAN I GET A GAVE ME THE INSPIRATION TO OUR TO DO THE LEGISLATION WELL I WAS ACTUALLY CONTACTED BY A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT LOCAL OFFICIALS IN MY COUNTY. WHO SAID YOU KNOW WE USE SOCIAL MEDIA ALL THE TIME BUT THERE REALLY IS VERY LITTLE GUIDANCE ON HOW. WE CAN BE OPERATING- WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THE BROWN ACT- BUT IN THE SOCIAL MEDIA CONTACTS IN FACT ONE OF THE LOCAL OFFICIALS HAVE HAPPEN TO WORK FOR FACEBOOK. AND WAS ACUTELY AWARE OF SORT OF THE LACK OF CLARITY AND WE'VE HEARD OF MULTIPLE EXAMPLES IN THE LEAGUE MAY WANT TO OPINE ON THIS BUT- DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF YOUR CITY ATTORNEY AND THEIR- LEVEL OF COMFORT WITH SOCIAL MEDIA. THERE IS VARYING ADVICE BEING GIVEN TO LOCAL ELECTED ACROSS THE STATE BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF CLARITY WITH WITH THE BROWN ACT AND SOME OF ITS I DON'T WANT TO SIT IN EQUITY PROVISIONS BECAUSE I THINK THE BROWN ACT AS A FIVE. PIECE OF CALIFORNIA LAW WHICH IS WHY MAKE SURE WERE MY- IT BRINGING IN TWO THE SO MEDIA ERA AND REALLY BRINGING OUT SOME OF THE FRANKLY REP RESTRICTIONS INTO THIS CURRENT- ERA WE HAVE WITHOUT A RESTRICTING CONSTITUENT TO ELECTED COMMUNICATIONS WHICH- IS ABSOLUTELY VITAL. AND WE KNOW THAT- I CAN SPEAK PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AS A FORMER- LOCAL ELECTED THAT. THESE ARE BEING READILY USED ESPECIALLY NOW WITH- DURING THIS COBIT ERA WHERE TECHNOLOGIES BEING EMPLOYED BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UP ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- THIS IS GOING TO BE I THINK A RICH AREA OF LAW MOVING FORWARD. BUT THIS IS A GOOD FIRST STEP- FOR THE FOR THE SOCIAL MEDIA HI ERIN GIVE A LITTLE MORE GUIDANCE FOR LOCAL ELECTIVES HAS ANYONE FILED ANY GRIEVANCES WITH THE FAIR POLITICAL PRACTICES COMMISSION THE F. PPC THAT. YOU'RE ALSO TRYING TO. RESEARCH TO BY SAYING BOY THAT WAS A RULING THAT JUST DIDN'T SEEM TO FIT IN WHAT'S GOING ON REALITY. SO A- SENATOR IF YOU CAN JUST FIRST% PART OF YOUR- APPLE WHAT WE HAVE THE PPC AND I'M WONDERING WAS ANYONE. ANYONE READ IT RECEIVE A LETTER SAYING BOY YOU YOU THE THREE OF YOU IF YOU FIVE WORKED ON. YOU KNOW SOCIAL MEDIA TOGETHER AND THEREFORE WE'RE WE'RE SENDING YOU A WARNING LETTER OR WERE ASKING YOU TO CSS I DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE- I. COULD TURN TO OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT RAP TO SEE IF THEY'RE AWARE OF- ANY PENDING. KINDS OF SUITS ARE NO THERE'S DEFINITELY AN INTERPRETIVE ELEMENT HERE WITH DISTRICT ATTORNEYS. I IN TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT- THERE'S A PROSPECTIVE BRIDE ACT VIOLATION BUT THIS IS VERY MUCH- OF A VACANT AREA OF LAW FRANKLY IN THIS SOCIAL MEDIA- AND THAT WAS THE INTENT BEHIND THE BILL BUT I DON'T KNOW IF UP. OF THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES WANTS TO SPEAK TO THAT. ALL RIGHTS OF A QUESTION ISN'T EVERYTHING Q.

T. P. C. I THINK AB ASSEMBLY MEMBER MALL AND SPOKE TO THE CRUX OF THE ISSUE AND PROP THE REASON WHY. WE DON'T SEE THOSE ARE THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF ENFORCING ACTIONS AREN'T. HAPPENING IS BECAUSE THERE IS NEEDED BY THE COUNCIL MEMBERS ACROSS THE STATE FROM THE CITY ATTORNEY'S ARE RECEIVING IS SO DIFFERENT ABOUT THE DEGREE TO WHICH THEY MAY INTERACT. WITH THE PUBLIC. THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA THAT THAT WOULD WORK WOULD BE TO REMEDY THE LEGISLATION IT IS NOTSO MUCH THAT THERE ARE. LAWSUIT THAT HAVE BEEN INITIATED BECAUSE THE UNIT BURDEN ACTION BY COUNCILMEMBER BUT RATHER WORK TRYING TO BE A LITTLE BIT AT THE WHITE GUIDANCE. BUT IT BUT PROPRIA COUNCILMEMBER NAPA DIRECT INTERACTION WITH THEIR- SITUATION. EVEN IF EIGHTY NINE NINETY WERE TO BECOME LAW. THE LIBERATION COMPONENT BETWEEN COUNCIL MEMBERS WOULD STILL BE ILLEGAL AND WOULD STILL BE A BROWN ACT VIOLATIONS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO- WORK FOR. IS THAT THERE ARE CLEAR GUIDANCE. ABOUT HOW COUNCIL MEMBER. WITH THEIR KEY IF YOU. NOW AMONG THEM. BECAUSE THAT WOULD GO AT THE O THE PROBE IN THE ACT ON DELIBERATION BETWEEN COUNCILMEMBER IF THAT MAKES SENSE AND THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER MALL AND FOR ALLOWING ME TO ASK.
