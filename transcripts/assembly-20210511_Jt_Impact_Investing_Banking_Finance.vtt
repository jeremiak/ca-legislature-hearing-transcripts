THAT'S MY ABSOLUTE PLEASURE TO

BE HERE. SO YOU WOULD ASK ME- A

00:32:17.468 --> 00:32:18.770
LITTLE BIT I GUESS IS AS AN

00:32:18.836 --> 00:32:20.638
OPENING QUESTION ABOUT THE

00:32:20.705 --> 00:32:22.240
FIELD OF SUSTAINABLE FINANCE

00:32:22.307 --> 00:32:23.875
AND WHERE THIS IS ALL HEADED

00:32:23.941 --> 00:32:26.944
SO- MAYBE I WILL START THERE.

00:32:27.011 --> 00:32:28.046
IN TERMS OF A LITTLE BIT OF

00:32:28.112 --> 00:32:29.814
LEVEL SETTING AND SOME

00:32:29.881 --> 00:32:31.816
TERMINOLOGY JUST SO THAT- WE'RE

00:32:31.883 --> 00:32:33.251
ALL SPEAKING SO TO SPEAK FROM

00:32:33.318 --> 00:32:35.353
THE SAME HYMN SHEET. ON THE SO

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:36.587
FIRST OF ALL WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

00:32:36.654 --> 00:32:37.689
THE FIELD OF SUSTAINABLE

00:32:37.755 --> 00:32:39.257
FINANCE AND SOMETIMES I THINK

00:32:39.324 --> 00:32:40.725
THAT THIS IS- IT'S MORE

00:32:40.792 --> 00:32:42.327
COMPLICATED THAN IT NEEDS TO BE

00:32:42.393 --> 00:32:43.594
THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT THIS

00:32:43.661 --> 00:32:46.698
DEFINITION ONLY. IS- A REALLY

00:32:46.764 --> 00:32:48.299
SUSTAINABLE FINANCES A TOOL

00:32:48.366 --> 00:32:50.568
THROUGH WHICH INVESTORS CAN

00:32:50.635 --> 00:32:53.604
BOTH MITIGATE RISK AND IDENTIFY

00:32:53.671 --> 00:32:55.473
OPPORTUNITIES AND THAT IS BY

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:57.842
LOOKING AT THE S. N. G. FACTOR

00:32:57.909 --> 00:32:59.644
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL AND

00:32:59.711 --> 00:33:01.713
GOVERNANCE FACTORS. IN

00:33:01.779 --> 00:33:03.047
INCORPORATE THOSE INTO

00:33:03.114 --> 00:33:05.983
INVESTMENT STRATEGIES ALONGSIDE

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:07.685
TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL METRICS

00:33:07.752 --> 00:33:08.886
SO THE IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE

00:33:08.953 --> 00:33:09.854
HERE IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING

00:33:09.921 --> 00:33:12.023
ABOUT SUSTAINABLE FINANCE THIS

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:14.726
IS RETURNS BASED INVESTING SO

00:33:14.792 --> 00:33:16.394
THOSE WHO ARE PARTICIPATING ARE

00:33:16.461 --> 00:33:18.463
EXPECTING TO GENERATE A RETURN.

00:33:18.529 --> 00:33:19.697
AND I WOULD SAY FOR THE VAST

00:33:19.764 --> 00:33:21.099
PREPONDERANCE OF SUSTAINABLE

00:33:21.165 --> 00:33:23.067
INVESTORS THEY'RE SEEKING TO

00:33:23.134 --> 00:33:24.702
GENERATE A MARKET RATE OF

00:33:24.769 --> 00:33:26.637
RETURN FOR BETTER FROM THESE

00:33:26.704 --> 00:33:29.073
INVESTMENT SO- THE VAST

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:30.675
MAJORITY OF THOSE PARTICIPATING

00:33:30.742 --> 00:33:32.043
IN THE SPACE ARE NOT LOOKING AT

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:33.644
CONCESSIONARY RETURN AND I

00:33:33.711 --> 00:33:34.412
THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

00:33:34.479 --> 00:33:36.614
BECAUSE- I THINK THERE'S A BIT

00:33:36.681 --> 00:33:38.149
OF A MISNOMER. THAT WHEN YOU

00:33:38.216 --> 00:33:39.117
GET INTO THE FIELD IMPACT

00:33:39.183 --> 00:33:40.852
INVESTING OR SOMETHING THAT IS

00:33:40.918 --> 00:33:42.086
TRYING TO ACHIEVE POSITIVE

00:33:42.153 --> 00:33:43.788
SOCIAL ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOMES

00:33:43.855 --> 00:33:45.590
WITH CAPITAL THAT COMES AT A

00:33:45.656 --> 00:33:47.658
COST. AND WE WOULD ACTUALLY

00:33:47.725 --> 00:33:49.093
MAKE A DIFFERENT ARGUMENT THAT

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:51.295
IN MOST CASES ON A RISK

00:33:51.362 --> 00:33:52.597
ADJUSTED BASIS YOU CAN GENERATE

00:33:52.663 --> 00:33:54.665
OUTSIZE RETURNS BY TAKING THESE

00:33:54.732 --> 00:33:56.768
FACTORS INTO CONSIDERATION. SO

00:33:56.834 --> 00:33:58.669
WITH THAT AS A BACKDROP AND IF

00:33:58.736 --> 00:34:00.471
I THINK ABOUT THE SPECTRUM OF

00:34:00.538 --> 00:34:02.974
FINANCE ON THE ONE HAND IF YOU

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:05.643
THINK OF A GRID OR SPECTRUM. ON

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:06.911
FAR LEFT WE THINK ABOUT

00:34:06.978 --> 00:34:07.879
TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL

00:34:07.945 --> 00:34:10.214
INSTRUMENTS AND ALL THOSE DO IS

00:34:10.281 --> 00:34:11.382
SEEK TO GENERATE A RISK

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:17.555
ADJUSTED RETURNS. AND THEY ASK.

00:34:17.622 --> 00:34:18.189
NOTHING MORE OF THAT INVESTMENT

00:34:18.256 --> 00:34:19.323
THE TO GENERATE THAT WERE. AND

00:34:19.390 --> 00:34:20.625
THEN WE MOVE INTO THE FIELDS

00:34:20.691 --> 00:34:21.559
STAND OFF I. WHAT WE'RE TRYING

00:34:21.626 --> 00:34:24.061
TO IS TO EITHER CREATE. ALIGNED

00:34:24.128 --> 00:34:25.797
INVESTMENT FOR TO DRIVE

00:34:25.863 --> 00:34:27.799
OUTCOMES. SO THE UMBRELLA

00:34:27.865 --> 00:34:29.567
TERMINOLOGY THAT MOST PEOPLE

00:34:29.634 --> 00:34:31.636
USES ESG INVESTING WHEN THEY

00:34:31.702 --> 00:34:32.336
TALK ABOUT SUSTAINABLE

00:34:32.403 --> 00:34:34.272
INVESTING. BUT THAT'S JUST A

00:34:34.338 --> 00:34:35.907
STARTING POINT AND WE WOULD SAY

00:34:35.973 --> 00:34:37.375
THAT THAT IS REALLY JUST GOOD

00:34:37.442 --> 00:34:39.177
HYGIENE. SO LOOKING

00:34:39.243 --> 00:34:40.244
ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL AND

00:34:40.311 --> 00:34:41.479
GOVERNANCE CHARACTERISTICS IN

00:34:41.546 --> 00:34:43.681
YOUR INVESTMENTS. LEADS YOU TO

00:34:43.748 --> 00:34:45.750
A PLACE WHERE YOU THEN CAN

00:34:45.817 --> 00:34:47.251
DECIDE WHETHER YOU'RE TRYING TO

00:34:47.318 --> 00:34:49.954
DRIVE REAL IMPACT. AND WE START

00:34:50.021 --> 00:34:51.722
TYPICALLY WITH EXCLUSIONS

00:34:51.789 --> 00:34:53.491
THAT'S THE SIMPLE PLACE TO GO.

00:34:53.558 --> 00:34:55.426
WHEREINVESTORS SAY I DO NOT

00:34:55.493 --> 00:34:58.763
WANT TO HAVE. ANY EXPOSURE TO

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:00.031
CERTAIN THINGS IN MY PORTFOLIO

00:35:00.097 --> 00:35:01.499
THAT COULD BE WEAPONS THAT

00:35:01.566 --> 00:35:03.234
COULD BE TOBACCO COULD BE

00:35:03.301 --> 00:35:04.268
FOSSIL FUELS WE CALL THAT

00:35:04.335 --> 00:35:06.204
EXCLUSIONS. AND WE MOVED FROM

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:08.439
EXPLOSIONS. FURTHER TO THE

00:35:08.506 --> 00:35:10.208
RIGHT AND WE TALK ABOUT ESG

00:35:10.274 --> 00:35:11.742
INTEGRATION WHERE WE'RE

00:35:11.809 --> 00:35:13.444
THINKING ABOUT THOSE ESG

00:35:13.511 --> 00:35:15.446
FACTORS IN OUR PORTFOLIOS IN A

00:35:15.513 --> 00:35:17.281
MORE DELIBERATE WAY. AND

00:35:17.348 --> 00:35:18.983
THINKING ABOUT WHERE RISK MIGHT

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:20.418
BE IDENTIFIED- OPPORTUNITIES

00:35:20.485 --> 00:35:24.222
pWE MOVE FURTHER TO THE RIGHT

00:35:24.288 --> 00:35:25.456
AND NOW WE'RE MOVING INTO THE

00:35:25.523 --> 00:35:27.291
WORLD OF IMPACT INVESTING. THIS

00:35:27.358 --> 00:35:29.126
IS A VERY DELIBERATE SPACE SO

00:35:29.193 --> 00:35:31.229
INVESTORS WITHIN IMPACTS ARE

00:35:31.295 --> 00:35:32.997
SAYING I WANT TO ACHIEVE

00:35:33.064 --> 00:35:34.365
CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL OR SOCIAL

00:35:34.432 --> 00:35:37.068
OUTCOMES. AND I'M PREPARED TO

00:35:37.134 --> 00:35:39.136
MEASURE MYSELF AND HOLD MYSELF

00:35:39.203 --> 00:35:40.471
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE DELIVERY OF

00:35:40.538 --> 00:35:42.507
THOSE OUTCOMES AS WELL AS A

00:35:42.573 --> 00:35:44.242
FINANCIAL RETURN. SO WE SAY THE

00:35:44.308 --> 00:35:46.210
TENETS OF IMPACT INVESTING. OR

00:35:46.277 --> 00:35:48.779
INTENTIONALITY. MEASURE ABILITY

00:35:48.846 --> 00:35:51.849
OF IMPACT. AND REPORTING AND

00:35:51.916 --> 00:35:52.717
HOLDING YOURSELF ACCOUNTABLE TO

00:35:52.783 --> 00:35:54.519
THE IMPACT. AND ALL BREAK

00:35:54.585 --> 00:35:55.920
IMPACT INVESTING DOWN THEN

00:35:55.987 --> 00:35:57.922
FURTHER INTO TWO CATEGORIES ONE

00:35:57.989 --> 00:35:59.490
WE CALL RETURNS FIRST AND THIS

00:35:59.557 --> 00:36:00.925
IS WHERE WE'RE FOCUSING ON

00:36:00.992 --> 00:36:02.326
MARKET RATE OF RETURN OR BETTER

00:36:02.393 --> 00:36:04.529
FORGET AN ASSET CLASS. AND THEN

00:36:04.595 --> 00:36:06.597
THERE'S THE IMPACT FIRST WHERE

00:36:06.664 --> 00:36:08.499
WE'RE FOCUSED ON DELIVERING A

00:36:08.566 --> 00:36:10.668
CERTAIN IMPACT AND BE PREPARED

00:36:10.735 --> 00:36:12.570
TO TAKE CONCESSIONARY RETURNS.

00:36:12.637 --> 00:36:17.842
BECAUSE THE CAPITAL. NEEDS TO

00:36:17.909 --> 00:36:18.576
BE CATALYTIC. AND I THE ALL OF

00:36:18.643 --> 00:36:20.878
THESE ARE. IN MAKING HOW. A

00:36:20.945 --> 00:36:21.879
STATE PURCHASE IN THE SPACE TO

00:36:21.946 --> 00:36:23.614
OUT. BUT THEN FINALLY AS WE

00:36:23.681 --> 00:36:24.916
MOVE FARTHER TO THE RIGHT WE

00:36:24.982 --> 00:36:25.816
MOVE INTO THE WORLD OF

00:36:25.883 --> 00:36:27.885
PHILANTHROPY- AND THAT IS WHERE

00:36:27.952 --> 00:36:29.320
YOU ARE GIVING MONEY AWAY AND

00:36:29.387 --> 00:36:30.288
NOT ASKING FOR ANYTHING IN

00:36:30.354 --> 00:36:32.523
RETURN. AND ACROSS THE ENTIRE

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:35.493
SPECTRUM FROM EXCLUSIONS

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.395
THROUGH DELIBERATE IMPACT

00:36:37.461 --> 00:36:38.663
THERE'S A PLACE FOR EVERYBODY

00:36:38.729 --> 00:36:40.298
AND A COMBINATION IN DIVERSE

00:36:40.364 --> 00:36:42.934
PORTFOLIOS IN OUR OPINION. THAT

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.869
STILL CAN A LINE WITH VALUES

00:36:44.936 --> 00:36:46.571
INVESTING AND I CAN STILL DRIVE

00:36:46.637 --> 00:36:48.472
OUTCOMES SO CONTEXTUALLY MAYBE

00:36:48.539 --> 00:36:50.241
I CAN JUST GIVE YOU A FLAVOR

00:36:50.308 --> 00:36:51.142
FOR THE SIZE OF THE OVERALL

00:36:51.208 --> 00:36:53.511
MARKET. SO THE OVERALL UMBRELLA

00:36:53.578 --> 00:36:56.047
OF SUSTAINABLE INVESTING- OUR

00:36:56.113 --> 00:36:57.248
EXPECTATION WHEN THE NEW

00:36:57.315 --> 00:36:58.816
STATISTICS ARE GOING TO COME

00:36:58.883 --> 00:36:59.584
OUT WHICH WOULD BE VERY

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:02.253
SHORTLY. BUT IT WILL BE ABOUT

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.321
EIGHT FIFTY TRILLION DOLLAR

00:37:03.387 --> 00:37:05.022
MARKET SO THAT'S CAPITAL

00:37:05.089 --> 00:37:06.624
INVESTED IN SUSTAINABLE

00:37:06.691 --> 00:37:09.293
STRATEGIES ACROSS THE BOARD SO

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:11.062
FIFTY TRILLION. AND THE GROWTH

00:37:11.128 --> 00:37:12.697
RATE HAS BEEN NORTH OF A

00:37:12.763 --> 00:37:15.132
HUNDRED AND 75% ANNUALLY FOR

00:37:15.199 --> 00:37:17.234
EACH OF THE PAST FOUR TO FIVE

00:37:17.301 --> 00:37:19.136
YEARS SO EXTRAORDINARY ORGANIC

00:37:19.203 --> 00:37:21.439
GROWTH IN THIS MARKET. AND THAT

00:37:21.505 --> 00:37:24.442
REPRESENTS ABOUT A THIRD OF THE

00:37:24.508 --> 00:37:28.579
OVERALL FINANCIAL MARKETS. IN

00:37:28.646 --> 00:37:29.180
TERMS OF ANNUAL INVESTMENTS.

00:37:29.246 --> 00:37:31.148
OUR OF THAT IMPACTED. IS A VERY

00:37:31.215 --> 00:37:33.818
SMALL SUBSET TODAY THAT'S ABOUT

00:37:33.884 --> 00:37:35.486
A TRILLION DOLLAR MARKET.

00:37:35.553 --> 00:37:36.754
VERSUS THE FIFTY TRILLION

00:37:36.821 --> 00:37:39.357
OVERALL BUT ITS GROWTH RATE IS

00:37:39.423 --> 00:37:41.792
NORTH OF A 1000% SO COMING FROM

00:37:41.859 --> 00:37:43.761
A SMALL BASE BUT GROWING

00:37:43.828 --> 00:37:46.230
EXPONENTIALLY. AND WHY IS THAT

00:37:46.297 --> 00:37:48.165
WHY IS THAT HAPPENING IT'S

00:37:48.232 --> 00:37:49.500
BECAUSE I THINK IMPACT

00:37:49.567 --> 00:37:50.901
INVESTING IS CAPTURING THE

00:37:50.968 --> 00:37:52.003
HEARTS AND MINDS OF THE

00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:53.638
INVESTMENT COMMUNITY BECAUSE

00:37:53.704 --> 00:37:55.573
YOU CAN MEASURE OUTCOMES. AND

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:56.607
THIS IS WHAT'S CAPTIVATING

00:37:56.674 --> 00:37:58.175
PEOPLE IF YOU CAN GENERATE A

00:37:58.242 --> 00:38:00.111
RETURN. THAT'S A MARKET RATE OR

00:38:00.177 --> 00:38:02.079
BETTER. AND YOU CAN ACHIEVE AN

00:38:02.146 --> 00:38:03.614
OUTCOME THAT'S MEASURABLE

00:38:03.681 --> 00:38:05.683
THAT'S CAUSING A POSITIVE

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:07.184
OUTCOME ON THE ENVIRONMENT ARE

00:38:07.251 --> 00:38:09.286
ON SOCIETAL ISSUES WHAT'S NOT

00:38:09.353 --> 00:38:10.554
TO LIKE ABOUT THAT IT'S SORT OF

00:38:10.621 --> 00:38:12.189
THE- DOUBLE OR SOMETIMES PEOPLE

00:38:12.256 --> 00:38:13.758
CALL THE TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE SO

00:38:13.824 --> 00:38:15.960
WIN WIN FOR EVERYBODY. AND

00:38:16.027 --> 00:38:17.161
THOSE WHO ARE PARTICIPATING IN

00:38:17.228 --> 00:38:18.629
THIS SPACE IT IS THE ENTIRE

00:38:18.696 --> 00:38:20.798
FINANCIAL SYSTEM. WE SEE

00:38:20.865 --> 00:38:22.433
INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS AT

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:23.401
SCALE GETTING INVOLVED IN

00:38:23.467 --> 00:38:25.670
IMPACT. WE SEE SOVEREIGN WEALTH

00:38:25.736 --> 00:38:28.305
FUNDS. PENSION FUNDS INSURANCE

00:38:28.372 --> 00:38:29.907
COMPANIES AND THE LIKE SO IT'S

00:38:29.974 --> 00:38:31.776
REALLY VERY VERY DEEP AND BROAD

00:38:31.842 --> 00:38:33.944
BASED. AGAIN THE LARGEST

00:38:34.011 --> 00:38:35.279
COMPONENT THAT IS A STABLE

00:38:35.346 --> 00:38:36.414
INVESTING STRATEGIES BUT THIS

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.482
IMPACT SPACE IS INCREASINGLY

00:38:38.549 --> 00:38:40.551
SOMETHING. WHERE INVESTORS ARE

00:38:40.618 --> 00:38:42.820
GETTING VERY EXCITED. ONE SMALL

00:38:42.887 --> 00:38:44.155
EXAMPLE OF THE SOVEREIGN WEALTH

00:38:44.221 --> 00:38:46.424
SIDE. IS THAT THIS YEAR OUT OF

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:48.159
THAT- CIRCA TRILLION MARKET

00:38:48.225 --> 00:38:49.994
THAT WE JUST DISCUSSED. WE JUST

00:38:50.061 --> 00:38:51.462
HAD ANNOUNCEMENT SEVERAL WEEKS

00:38:51.529 --> 00:38:54.031
AGO THAT TOMASZ AND- THE ASIAN

00:38:54.098 --> 00:38:55.566
SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS. IS

00:38:55.633 --> 00:38:58.536
PUTTING FIVE HUNDRED- FIVE

00:38:58.602 --> 00:39:01.138
HUNDRED MILLION OF CAPITAL INTO

00:39:01.205 --> 00:39:02.973
ONE IMPACT FUND MANAGER BECAUSE

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:03.974
THEY'RE TRYING TO DRIVE SOCIAL

00:39:04.041 --> 00:39:05.209
OUTCOMES AND THEY WANT TO BE

00:39:05.276 --> 00:39:06.544
SUPPORTIVE OF THOSE OUTCOMES.

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:08.646
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS SIZE

00:39:08.713 --> 00:39:10.881
BONTA ON THAT WE'RE SEEING. SO

00:39:10.948 --> 00:39:12.183
OUR EVERY EXPECTATION IS THAT

00:39:12.249 --> 00:39:13.117
THESE GROWTH RATES WILL

00:39:13.184 --> 00:39:15.286
CONTINUE. AND WE BELIEVE THAT'S

00:39:15.352 --> 00:39:16.620
THE CASE BECAUSE ALL OF

00:39:16.687 --> 00:39:19.356
FOUNDATIONS ARE THERE. WE SEE

00:39:19.423 --> 00:39:21.125
REGULATORY INTERVENTION

00:39:21.192 --> 00:39:24.161
POLICYMAKERS POLITICAL LEADERS

00:39:24.228 --> 00:39:26.063
ALL WANTING TO ADDRESS BIG

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:30.835
SOCIETAL. ISSUES LIKE CLIMATE

00:39:30.901 --> 00:39:31.736
CHANGE OR SOCIAL ENACT WHAT.

00:39:31.802 --> 00:39:32.903
AND DOING WHAT THEY CAN BROUGH

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:34.705
AYE SAFELY WILL. IS GENERALLY

00:39:34.772 --> 00:39:36.073
MANIFEST IN REGULAR. I WERE

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:38.075
SEEING REGULATE PROLIFERATE.

00:39:38.142 --> 00:39:39.610
ACROSS THE PIECE TO TRY TO

00:39:39.677 --> 00:39:41.479
DRIVE MORE CAPITAL GOING INTO

00:39:41.545 --> 00:39:43.447
THE SPACE SO LET ME GIVE YOU AN

00:39:43.514 --> 00:39:44.849
EXAMPLE I CAN SKIP AROUND THE

00:39:44.915 --> 00:39:46.383
WORLD IF YOU LIKE TO TALK ABOUT

00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:47.351
REGIONALLY WHERE WE'RE SEEING

00:39:47.418 --> 00:39:49.320
ACTIVITY. BUT I HAVE TO POINT

00:39:49.386 --> 00:39:51.055
PERSON FOR MOST OF THE E. U.

00:42:15.666 --> 00:42:17.534
RISKS LOOK LIKE BUT ALSO WHERE

00:42:17.601 --> 00:42:19.169
THIS COMPANY'S CHANGING AND

00:42:19.236 --> 00:42:21.005
MIGRATING THEIR BUSINESSES TO

00:42:21.071 --> 00:42:22.806
SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY THAT'S

00:42:22.873 --> 00:42:24.775
ASSOCIATED WITH CLIMATE CHANGE

00:42:24.842 --> 00:42:25.342
AND THOSE OPPORTUNITIES ARE

00:42:25.409 --> 00:42:27.211
ENORMOUS I MEAN. IF YOU EXAMPLE

00:42:27.278 --> 00:42:28.812
AFTER EXAMPLE BUT A SLIP BUT

00:42:28.879 --> 00:42:31.882
THAT I LIKE TO- SO OFTEN- GIVE.

00:42:31.949 --> 00:42:33.384
IS IF YOU THINK ABOUT A COMPANY

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:34.785
LIKE CHINA A COUNTRY LIKE

00:42:34.852 --> 00:42:37.288
CHINA. THAT IS NOW COMMITTED TO

00:42:37.354 --> 00:42:43.394
NET. ZERO BY TWENTY FIFTY

00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:44.295
TWENTY SIXTY- IN SO DOING THEIR

00:42:44.361 --> 00:42:46.430
PROMOTING. ENTIRE INCLUDING

00:42:46.497 --> 00:42:48.365
ENTIRE INDUSTRIES OVERNIGHT BY

00:42:48.432 --> 00:42:51.035
SIMPLE STATEMENTS SO ONE BEING

00:42:51.101 --> 00:42:52.836
THEY CAMEOUT NOT TOO LONG AGO

00:42:52.903 --> 00:42:54.104
AND SAID THAT WITHIN A SHORT

00:42:54.171 --> 00:42:55.205
PERIOD OF TIME THEY'RE GOING

00:42:55.272 --> 00:42:58.742
TO. BAN ALL PETROL VEHICLES. SO

00:42:58.809 --> 00:43:01.045
THE MINUTE CHINA SAID. IN AS

00:43:01.111 --> 00:43:03.080
SHORT WINDOW OF TIME THEY'LL

00:43:03.147 --> 00:43:05.816
BAN PETROL CARS WHAT HAVE THEY

00:43:05.883 --> 00:43:07.952
DONE. THEY BASICALLY CREATED A

00:43:08.018 --> 00:43:10.354
MULTI HUNDRED BILLION INDUSTRY

00:43:10.421 --> 00:43:12.356
AND LECTER VEHICLES ANY

00:43:12.423 --> 00:43:14.258
COMPONENT PARTS TO MANUFACTURE

00:43:14.325 --> 00:43:16.093
ANY OEM MANUFACTURER ANY

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:17.661
ELECTRIC VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE

00:43:17.728 --> 00:43:19.830
PROVIDER ALL OF THOSE COMPANIES

00:43:19.897 --> 00:43:21.065
ARE GOING TO BENEFIT FROM THE

00:43:21.131 --> 00:43:22.900
FACT THAT THE THREE HUNDRED

00:43:22.967 --> 00:43:23.534
MILLION AT MIDDLE CLASS

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.836
CONSUMERS. THAT ALL STATE OWNED

00:43:25.903 --> 00:43:27.805
CARS IN CHINA ARE GOING TO NEED

00:43:27.871 --> 00:43:29.573
TO BUY ELECTRIC CARS SO THERE

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:31.408
IS THE OPPORTUNITY SET IF

00:43:31.475 --> 00:43:32.977
YOU'RE AN INVESTOR OR IF YOUR

00:43:33.043 --> 00:43:35.012
COMPANY IN THOSE INDUSTRIES OR

00:43:35.079 --> 00:43:36.246
IF YOU'RE A COUNTRY THAT'S

00:43:36.313 --> 00:43:38.082
TRYING TO PUSH. TOWARD A

00:43:38.148 --> 00:43:40.384
GREENER SOLUTION BY PROMOTING

00:43:40.451 --> 00:43:41.785
AND SUGGESTING THAT THOSE ARE

00:43:41.852 --> 00:43:43.454
THE INDUSTRIES OF THE FUTURE

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:44.755
YOU CAN DRIVE OUTCOMES AND

00:43:44.822 --> 00:43:46.023
THAT'S WHERE THIS WHOLE IMPACT

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:49.159
INVESTING MESHES WITH I THINK

00:43:49.226 --> 00:43:49.660
POLITICAL AND REGULATORY

00:43:49.727 --> 00:43:51.662
INTERVENTION. THE OTHER THING

00:43:51.729 --> 00:43:53.297
THAT I WOULD POINT TO JUST IN

00:43:53.364 --> 00:43:54.999
TERMS OF NOMENCLATURE AND LEVEL

00:43:55.065 --> 00:43:57.501
SETTING IS ONE OF THE AREAS

00:43:57.568 --> 00:43:59.803
WHERE I THINK- WE ARE STILL

00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:01.438
CHALLENGED IF I'M HONEST AND

00:44:01.505 --> 00:44:03.107
SUSTAINABILITY FIELD. IS THERE

00:44:03.173 --> 00:44:05.642
IS NOT A COMMON DEFINITION FOR

00:44:05.709 --> 00:44:08.312
WHAT IS IMPACT OR INDEED WAS

00:44:08.379 --> 00:44:12.049
EVEN GROUP. AND A GOOD EXAMPLE-

00:44:12.116 --> 00:44:13.684
WOULD BE AN ELECTRIC DID LETTER

00:44:13.751 --> 00:44:15.619
VEHICLE INDUSTRY IF I LOOK AT

00:44:15.686 --> 00:44:17.621
MY CONSTITUENTS MY STAKEHOLDERS

00:44:17.688 --> 00:44:19.690
MANY OF MY INVESTORS. ABOUT

00:44:19.757 --> 00:44:21.892
HALF OF THEM WILL SAY TODAY-

00:44:21.959 --> 00:44:25.963
THEY PUT ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN

00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:26.530
THEIR SUSTAINABLE INVESTING

00:44:26.597 --> 00:44:28.332
BUCKET. BUT FULLY ANOTHER HALF

00:44:28.399 --> 00:44:30.067
OF MY INVESTORS WILL SAY THAT'S

00:44:30.134 --> 00:44:31.802
CORRECT WE'RE DRIVING TO A

00:44:31.869 --> 00:44:33.303
GREAT OUTCOME WITH THE HEAT.

00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:35.305
BUT TODAY WE'RE STILL RELIANT

00:44:35.372 --> 00:44:37.908
ON IMPORTS WHICH ARE DRIVEN

00:44:37.975 --> 00:44:40.177
FROM NON SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES

00:44:40.244 --> 00:44:42.312
SO BATTERY TECHNOLOGY IS STILL

00:44:42.379 --> 00:44:44.314
RELIANT ON BASE METALS MINING

00:44:44.381 --> 00:44:46.383
COBALT AND WHAT HAVE YOU. AND

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:48.252
OFTENTIMES THOSE MINES ARE

00:44:48.318 --> 00:44:49.753
HIGHLY POLLUTING OR THEY'RE NOT

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:50.754
SUSTAINABLE IN THE LABOR

00:44:50.821 --> 00:44:52.389
PRACTICES SO SOME OF THE

00:44:52.456 --> 00:44:54.024
INVESTORS WHO WANT TO GO MANY

00:44:54.091 --> 00:44:56.627
LEVELS DEEPER. DON'T YET PUT

00:44:56.693 --> 00:44:58.328
EVEY INTO THEIR SUSTAINABLE

00:44:58.395 --> 00:45:00.330
BUCKETS SO THIS MISMATCH OF

00:45:00.397 --> 00:45:01.165
DEFINITIONS IS SOMETHING THAT

00:45:01.231 --> 00:45:04.234
WE NEED TO I THINK COME TO SOME

00:45:04.301 --> 00:45:08.672
COMMON. AGREEMENT AROUND WHAT

00:45:08.739 --> 00:45:09.440
IS REALLY GREEN WHAT IS GREEN

00:45:09.506 --> 00:45:10.507
UP JACK WHAT IS TRENDS. AND

00:45:10.574 --> 00:45:11.141
THERE'S A LOT OF WORKING DONE

00:45:11.208 --> 00:45:13.710
IN THAT FIELD. BUT AND THE E.

00:45:13.777 --> 00:45:15.245
U. IS AGAIN SHOWING LEADERSHIP

00:45:15.312 --> 00:45:17.181
THERE WITH THE U. TAXONOMY THE

00:45:17.247 --> 00:45:18.949
GREEN TAXONOMY THEY WANT TO

00:45:19.016 --> 00:45:20.417
CREATE THOSE DEFINITIONS SO

00:45:20.484 --> 00:45:22.019
THAT WE CAN ALL BE SPEAKING

00:45:22.086 --> 00:45:23.720
ABOUT THE SAME THING WE TALK

00:45:23.787 --> 00:45:25.289
ABOUT INVESTING. IN A GREEN

00:45:25.355 --> 00:45:27.024
ALTERNATIVE- GREEN VESTMENT.

00:45:27.091 --> 00:45:28.392
THE OTHER AREA IN TERMS OF THE

00:45:28.459 --> 00:45:29.593
NOMENCLATURE THAT I THINK IS

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:32.096
IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND. IS THE

00:45:32.162 --> 00:45:33.630
IMPORTANCE OF THE UN

00:45:33.697 --> 00:45:35.365
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS

00:45:35.432 --> 00:45:36.733
AFFECTIONATELY KNOWN AS THE

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:39.636
ESTEY JEEZ. WHAT THE U. ENDED

00:45:39.703 --> 00:45:42.372
IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WAS TO TRY TO

00:45:42.439 --> 00:45:44.508
CATEGORIZE THE WORLD'S BIGGEST

00:45:44.575 --> 00:45:45.342
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL

00:45:45.409 --> 00:45:47.778
CHALLENGES. INTO SEVENTEEN

00:45:47.845 --> 00:45:51.081
CATEGORIES. AND BY DOING THAT.

00:45:51.148 --> 00:45:52.082
THEY ALLOW THE INVESTMENT

00:45:52.149 --> 00:45:53.450
COMMUNITY AND THE BROADER

00:45:53.517 --> 00:45:56.120
COMMUNITY AT LARGE TO IDENTIFY

00:45:56.186 --> 00:45:57.821
WITH THOSE AREAS THAT SPOKE TO

00:45:57.888 --> 00:46:00.924
THEM MOST. SO SDG FIVE SEVEN

00:46:00.991 --> 00:46:02.726
AND NINE THAT COULD BE GENDER

00:46:02.793 --> 00:46:06.663
EQUALITY ACCESS TO EDUCATION. I

00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:09.867
ENDING POVERTY- CLARINET- GREEN

00:46:09.933 --> 00:46:12.236
ENERGY- SMART CITIES AND GRAY

00:46:12.302 --> 00:46:14.304
AND GREEN AND AFFORDABLE- AND-

00:46:14.371 --> 00:46:17.274
EDUCATION CITIES. SO I WOULD

00:46:17.341 --> 00:46:19.176
HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT IS YOU'RE

00:46:19.243 --> 00:46:21.278
THINKING ABOUT THIS TOPIC. THAT

00:46:21.345 --> 00:46:23.347
YOU THINK ABOUT WHERE THE STATE

00:46:23.413 --> 00:46:24.882
MINUS ONE MIGHT WANT TO BE

00:46:24.948 --> 00:46:27.184
DRIVING OUTCOMES IN SPECIFIC

00:46:27.251 --> 00:46:28.886
CATEGORIES THAT WILL ALIGN

00:46:28.952 --> 00:46:30.888
THEMSELVES TO THE SDGS BECAUSE

00:46:30.954 --> 00:46:32.289
THAT'S THE LANGUAGE THAT THE

00:46:32.356 --> 00:46:34.091
FINANCIAL COMMUNITY. AND THE

00:46:34.158 --> 00:46:35.659
INVESTMENT COMMUNITY BROADLY ON

00:46:35.726 --> 00:46:37.628
THE CORPORATE MEDIA ARE USING

00:46:37.694 --> 00:46:39.129
TO TRY TO CATEGORIZE THE PLACES

00:46:39.196 --> 00:46:44.935
WHERE THEY WANT. TO PARTICIPATE

00:46:45.002 --> 00:46:46.303
AND DRIVE THOSE OUTCOMES- I

00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:48.338
GUESS- I HOPEFULLY SETTING A

00:46:48.405 --> 00:46:49.873
BIT IS BUT I US TO IN A BECAUSE

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:50.474
I THINK THE GOING TO BE MOST

00:46:50.541 --> 00:46:52.943
PART FOR ALL OF YOU- I THINK I

00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:54.411
WILL MAYBE TURN TO THE NEXT

00:46:54.478 --> 00:46:55.913
QUESTION THAT WAS POSED TO ME

00:46:55.979 --> 00:46:57.981
BY SOMEONE THAT WHICH IS WHERE

00:46:58.048 --> 00:46:59.449
HAS THE LEGISLATURE GET

00:46:59.516 --> 00:47:02.886
INVOLVED AND TRY TO DRIVE. SOME

00:47:02.953 --> 00:47:04.454
OF THESE OUTCOMES. WELL ONE OF

00:47:04.521 --> 00:47:06.890
THE BIG AREAS I THINK- THAT IS

00:47:06.957 --> 00:47:08.892
WORTH THINKING ABOUT. IS THE

00:47:08.959 --> 00:47:11.261
CAPITAL RAISING ARENA. AS A

00:47:11.328 --> 00:47:14.831
STATE. SO ONE OF THE CATEGORIES

00:47:14.898 --> 00:47:15.399
OF THIS OVERALL SUSTAINABLE

00:47:15.465 --> 00:47:18.101
INVESTMENTS. IS THE DEBT PUBLIC

00:47:18.168 --> 00:47:20.037
DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS SO THE

00:47:20.103 --> 00:47:21.405
GREEN BOND MARKETS IN THE

00:47:21.471 --> 00:47:23.040
SUSTAINABLE BOND MARKETS WHICH

00:47:23.106 --> 00:47:25.375
HAVE AN EQUAL- A GROWTH RATE

00:47:25.442 --> 00:47:26.176
AND TRAJECTORY THAT WE'RE

00:47:26.243 --> 00:47:28.245
SEEING IN TERMS OF MARKET

00:47:28.312 --> 00:47:30.414
APPETITE AND ENTHUSIASM. LAST

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:41.258
YEAR WE HAD. ALL NEW RECORD

00:47:41.325 --> 00:47:41.858
VOLUMES OF ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED

00:47:41.925 --> 00:47:44.194
AND BILLION. IN THE GREEN AND

00:47:44.261 --> 00:47:45.362
SUSTAINABLE BONTA. AND THIS IS

00:47:45.429 --> 00:47:47.231
WHERE AND ISSUER IS SIX IN THE

00:47:47.297 --> 00:47:48.699
MARK. WHERE THEY ARE AGREE.

00:47:48.765 --> 00:47:50.667
THAT THE USE OF THAT INSURANCE

00:47:50.734 --> 00:47:51.835
WILL BE INVEST. IN GREEN OR

00:47:51.902 --> 00:47:54.738
SOCIAL ALKA. THAT IS- NOW A TEN

00:47:54.805 --> 00:47:57.507
YEAR LD MARKET. THAT IS-

00:47:57.574 --> 00:47:58.909
WHETHER YOU'RE A CORPORATE

00:47:58.976 --> 00:48:00.711
SOVEREIGN MUNICIPALITIES AND

00:48:00.777 --> 00:48:02.646
THEIR AVAILING THEMSELVES OF

00:48:02.713 --> 00:48:04.214
THIS MARKET IN ORDER TO RAISE

00:48:04.281 --> 00:48:05.782
CAPITAL FOR VERY DELIBERATE

00:48:05.849 --> 00:48:08.352
OUTCOMES. AND I CAN TELL YOU

00:48:08.418 --> 00:48:09.419
THAT THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY

00:48:09.486 --> 00:48:12.055
IS. ABSOLUTELY FOCUSED ON

00:48:12.122 --> 00:48:13.690
TRYING TO PUT MONEY TO WORK IN

00:48:13.757 --> 00:48:16.093
THE STRATEGIES EST STRATEGIES

00:48:16.159 --> 00:48:17.427
AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS ALL OF

00:48:17.494 --> 00:48:19.329
THE ISSUES THAT COME TO MARKET

00:48:19.396 --> 00:48:19.730
IN THIS GREEN AND

00:48:19.796 --> 00:48:21.498
SUSTAINABILITY SPACE. ARE

00:48:21.565 --> 00:48:23.233
SEEING ENORMOUS TAKE UP FROM

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:24.935
THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY-

00:48:25.002 --> 00:48:26.603
VIRTUALLY EVERY GREEN BOND THAT

00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:27.738
WE'RE BRINGING TO MARKET IS

00:48:27.804 --> 00:48:29.640
MULTIPLE TIMES OVER SUBSCRIBED

00:48:29.706 --> 00:48:30.540
AND WHAT THAT HAPPENED WHAT

00:48:30.607 --> 00:48:32.943
HAPPENS AS A BY PRODUCT OF THAT

00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:33.844
IN TERMS OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND

00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:35.512
EQUATION. IS THAT WITH ALL THAT

00:48:35.579 --> 00:48:36.847
ENTHUSIASM FROM DESPERATELY

00:48:36.913 --> 00:48:38.148
NEEDS THAT DRIVE DOWN COST OF

00:48:38.215 --> 00:48:39.916
CAPITAL SO IT'S ALSO A VERY

00:48:39.983 --> 00:48:41.618
EFFICIENT PLACE TO RAISE

00:48:41.685 --> 00:48:43.086
CAPITAL TO INVEST IN THESE

00:48:43.153 --> 00:48:45.088
THESE OUTCOMES. AND WHAT'S

00:48:45.155 --> 00:48:47.858
INTERESTING IS COAST COE THAT

00:48:47.924 --> 00:48:49.626
WERE DURING THIS YOU KNOW- CODE

00:48:49.693 --> 00:48:53.063
pYEAR. WE HAVE SEEN THE S.

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:55.165
REALLY COME INTO THE FOR. THERE

00:48:55.232 --> 00:48:57.200
WAS NOT EVEN SUCH A THING AS

00:48:57.267 --> 00:48:59.770
THIS IS A SOCIAL BONDS TWO

00:48:59.836 --> 00:49:01.238
THREE YEARS AGO AND LAST YEAR

00:49:01.305 --> 00:49:02.906
THAT WAS ABOUT THE SEVENTY

00:49:02.973 --> 00:49:04.708
BILLION DOLLARS PART OF THIS

00:49:04.775 --> 00:49:06.977
OVERALL SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY

00:49:07.044 --> 00:49:08.645
BILLION MARKET. SO BURSTING

00:49:08.712 --> 00:49:09.846
ONTO THE SCENE WITH THE

00:49:09.913 --> 00:49:11.381
INVESTMENT COMMUNITY SAYING

00:49:11.448 --> 00:49:12.916
THEY REALLY WANT TO PUT CAPITAL

00:49:12.983 --> 00:49:14.685
TO WORK INTO TRYING TO SOLVE

00:49:14.751 --> 00:49:15.752
SOME OF THESE INEQUITIES THAT

00:49:15.819 --> 00:49:17.654
WERE SURFACED BY HOPE THAT. SO

00:49:17.721 --> 00:49:18.989
THAT'S ANOTHER PLACE WHERE THE

00:49:19.056 --> 00:49:29.633
STATE LEGISLATURE. CAN THINK

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:30.167
ABOUT NOT ONLY ADDRESSING

00:49:30.233 --> 00:49:31.868
CLIMATE AND HE IS. BUT ALSO

00:49:31.935 --> 00:49:32.669
THINKING ABOUT OF THOSE SO

00:49:32.736 --> 00:49:34.204
ISSUE THAT WERE ARE TO. JUST IN

00:49:34.271 --> 00:49:36.106
THE OPENING. SO LET COULD BE AN

00:49:36.173 --> 00:49:37.307
ISSUE ARE OF ITS OWN GREEN

00:49:37.374 --> 00:49:43.847
SOCIAL BY- THE OTHER THING.

00:49:43.914 --> 00:49:45.082
THAT THINK YOU CAN DO WITH.

00:49:45.148 --> 00:49:47.250
INTERNET IS TO KEEP NOT OR AND

00:49:47.317 --> 00:49:49.219
SEND. TO THE- COMMUNITY. WHICH

00:49:49.286 --> 00:49:50.087
WILL DRIVE HOW. IN THOSE

00:49:50.153 --> 00:49:51.555
DROUGHT AND THOSE OUT. ONE OF

00:49:51.621 --> 00:49:52.189
THE THINGS THAT I CAN POINT TO

00:49:52.255 --> 00:49:53.890
AND- THAT'S A HUGE SIX. IS TAX

00:49:53.957 --> 00:49:56.360
EQUITY IN. FIRST AND- THAT'S AB.

00:49:56.426 --> 00:49:57.994
YOU SUCCESS. OF WHERE ARE BIT

00:49:58.061 --> 00:50:00.597
OF POLICY NUDGING AND- CREATED

00:50:00.664 --> 00:50:02.499
A AN ENORMOUS INDUSTRY AND

00:50:02.566 --> 00:50:06.136
TODAY- I BELIEVE- MAYBE CALL IT

00:50:06.203 --> 00:50:08.138
NOTWITHSTANDING. THAT SOLAR

00:50:08.205 --> 00:50:09.773
INSTALLERS AS IS ONE OF THE

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:13.276
LARGEST EMPLOYERS. ALL IN ALL

00:50:13.343 --> 00:50:15.679
INDUSTRY SEGMENTS IN THE U. S.

00:50:15.746 --> 00:50:18.815
SO NOT JUST WORK. BUT EQUALLY

00:50:18.882 --> 00:50:20.250
SO DO SHALL WE SAY TAXES OR

00:50:20.317 --> 00:50:22.586
PENALTIES. SOMETHING LIKE A

00:50:22.652 --> 00:50:25.789
CARBON TAX WHERE THE PROCEEDS

00:50:25.856 --> 00:50:26.656
OF CARBON TAX ON HIGH CARBON

00:50:26.723 --> 00:50:28.258
EMITTING INDUSTRIES NOT ONLY

00:50:28.325 --> 00:50:30.227
CAN DRIVE MIGRATION TO PRINTER

00:50:30.293 --> 00:50:31.795
SOLUTIONS. BUT YOU CAN TAKE THE

00:50:31.862 --> 00:50:34.898
MONEY FROM THAT CARBON TAX AND

00:50:34.965 --> 00:50:36.666
INVESTED IN GREEN OR SOCIAL

00:50:36.733 --> 00:50:38.935
OUTCOMES SO THAT'S ANOTHER TYPE

00:50:39.002 --> 00:50:40.170
OF THING THAT YOU CAN DO I MEAN

00:50:40.237 --> 00:50:41.238
THEY'RE MANY OF THESE EXAMPLES

00:50:41.304 --> 00:50:43.106
AND HAPPY TO DESCRIBE THOSE IN

00:50:43.173 --> 00:50:44.274
MORE DETAIL. THE OTHER AREA

00:50:44.341 --> 00:50:45.809
THAT I WOULD JUST POINT TWO AND

00:50:45.876 --> 00:50:47.544
THEN I'LL STOP AND BE VERY

00:50:47.611 --> 00:50:49.746
HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. IT MAY

00:50:49.813 --> 00:50:52.416
BE CHALLENGING- THE LEGISLATURE

00:50:52.482 --> 00:50:53.283
TO THINK ABOUT PUBLIC PRIVATE

00:50:53.350 --> 00:50:56.820
PARTNERS. I CAN SEE- JUST IN

00:50:56.887 --> 00:50:57.421
THE SEVERAL YEARS THAT I'VE

00:50:57.487 --> 00:50:59.990
BEEN AT THIS WORK- ARE A REAL

00:51:00.056 --> 00:51:03.126
SEA CHANGE. IN THE MINDSET OF

00:51:03.193 --> 00:51:05.228
THOSE IN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE

00:51:05.295 --> 00:51:07.731
SECTOR. WE USED TO. HAVE A SEAT

00:51:07.798 --> 00:51:08.999
PEOPLE OPERATING IN DIFFERENT

00:51:09.065 --> 00:51:11.701
SILOS WHERE THEY SAID THIS AREA

00:51:11.768 --> 00:51:13.503
IS THE CURFEW OF GOVERNMENTS

00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:15.605
AND THIS AREA IS THE PURVIEW OF

00:51:15.672 --> 00:51:17.441
THE PRIVATE SECTOR. WHAT WE

00:51:17.507 --> 00:51:19.209
FOUND AND I THINK THE ONE THING

00:51:19.276 --> 00:51:20.811
DESERVES A LOT OF CREDIT FOR

00:51:20.877 --> 00:51:23.146
THIS. BY SHOWING US WHAT THOSE

00:51:23.213 --> 00:51:24.848
WORLD BIG CHALLENGES ARE

00:51:24.915 --> 00:51:25.882
THROUGH THE U. N. SUSTAINABLE

00:51:25.949 --> 00:51:27.884
DEVELOPMENT GOALS. IT ALLOWED

00:51:27.951 --> 00:51:29.719
THE SCIENTIFIC AND ACADEMIC

00:51:29.786 --> 00:51:31.922
COMMUNITY TO SIZE THE PROBLEM

00:51:31.988 --> 00:51:33.390
IS WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO SOLVE

00:51:33.457 --> 00:51:38.795
THE WORLD'S BIGGEST. CHALLENGES

00:51:38.862 --> 00:51:39.796
BY TWENTY THIRTY WHAT'S IT

00:51:39.863 --> 00:51:40.464
GOING TO COST. AND WHAT WE FOR.

00:51:40.530 --> 00:51:42.232
IS THAT AND COST THAT WOULD TO

00:51:42.299 --> 00:51:44.267
BE INVEST. IN THE SEVENTEEN

00:51:44.334 --> 00:51:45.936
GOALS WAS SOMETHING ON THE

00:51:46.002 --> 00:51:49.039
ORDER WE COPE AT. ABOUT THREE

00:51:49.105 --> 00:51:49.806
TO FOUR TRILLION DOLLARS A

00:51:49.873 --> 00:51:51.942
YEAR. AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT

00:51:52.008 --> 00:51:53.343
THAT THERE ISN'T ENOUGH

00:51:53.410 --> 00:51:55.111
GOVERNMENT MONEY FOR NON PROFIT

00:51:55.178 --> 00:51:57.147
MONEY THAT EXIST IN THE WORLD.

00:51:57.214 --> 00:51:58.782
TO FILL THAT GAP WE NEED THE

00:51:58.849 --> 00:52:00.450
PRIVATE SECTOR TO PARTICIPATE

00:52:00.517 --> 00:52:01.618
BUT THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO PART

00:52:01.685 --> 00:52:03.186
PARTICIPATING CAN'T DO WHEN

00:52:03.253 --> 00:52:05.489
IT'S ON IT'S ON IT NEEDS- A

00:52:05.555 --> 00:52:08.058
COMBINATION. OF ALL OF THOSE

00:52:08.124 --> 00:52:09.426
PLAYERS ON THAT FINANCIAL

00:52:09.493 --> 00:52:11.661
SPECTRUM FROM CIVIL SOCIETY TO

00:52:11.728 --> 00:52:13.597
GOVERNMENT PRIVATE SECTOR AND

00:52:13.663 --> 00:52:14.631
EVEN PHILANTHROPIST TO WORK

00:52:14.698 --> 00:52:16.099
TOGETHER. AND ANOTHER

00:52:16.166 --> 00:52:18.368
BURGEONING AREA OF THIS OVERALL

00:52:18.435 --> 00:52:20.170
SUSTAINABILITY IMPACT IELD IS

00:52:20.237 --> 00:52:22.105
WHAT IS. A TOPIC CALLED BLENDED

00:52:22.172 --> 00:52:24.341
FINANCE. AND THIS IS WHERE YOU

00:52:24.407 --> 00:52:26.510
BRING DIFFERENT ACTORS TOGETHER

00:52:26.576 --> 00:52:28.879
IN THE SAME PROJECT OR SAME

00:52:28.945 --> 00:52:31.581
HAPPENED STRUCTURE. IN ORDER TO

00:52:31.648 --> 00:52:33.350
BRING THE DIFFERENT EXPERTISE

00:52:33.416 --> 00:52:35.352
OF THESE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SIX

00:52:35.418 --> 00:52:37.888
TOGETHER TO HAVE A MULTIPLIER

00:52:37.954 --> 00:52:39.956
FACTOR IN THE OUTCOME. SO YOU

00:52:40.023 --> 00:52:41.791
MIGHT HAVE ANY GIVEN STRUCTURE

00:52:41.858 --> 00:52:44.327
A LAYER OF THE PROJECT THIS

00:52:44.394 --> 00:52:45.996
ISN'T GOING TO ACHIEVE.

00:52:46.062 --> 00:52:47.797
CUSTOMARY MARKET RATES OF

00:52:47.864 --> 00:52:50.300
RETURN SO YOU NEED CATALYTIC

00:52:50.367 --> 00:52:52.402
WORK GOVERNMENT CAPITAL WORK

00:52:52.469 --> 00:52:54.771
BABY PHILANTHROPIC CAPITAL. TO

00:52:54.838 --> 00:52:56.439
PARTICIPATE AND TAKE THE

00:52:56.506 --> 00:52:57.974
RISKIEST LAYER OF THAT

00:52:58.041 --> 00:52:59.976
STRUCTURE OFF THE TABLE TO THE

00:53:00.043 --> 00:53:02.212
IN CROWD IN. THE FOR PROFIT

00:53:02.279 --> 00:53:04.514
PRIVATE SECTOR TO ALLOW IT TO

00:53:04.581 --> 00:53:06.049
GENERATE ITS MARKET RATE OF

00:53:06.116 --> 00:53:08.051
RETURN AND THEN YOU CAN UNLOCK

00:53:08.118 --> 00:53:09.686
OFTEN SEEMINGLY INTRACTABLE

00:53:09.753 --> 00:53:11.454
PROBLEMS. AND WE'VE SEEN THIS

00:53:11.521 --> 00:53:13.690
CONCEPT OF BLENDED FINANCE ARE

00:53:13.757 --> 00:53:15.559
BEGIN TO EXPERIMENT IN NUMEROUS

00:53:15.625 --> 00:53:17.527
PROJECTS. ARE WHAT THEY BE

00:53:17.594 --> 00:53:19.162
ENVIRONMENTAL OR SOCIAL AND

THEY'RE UNLOCKING PREVIOUSLY

00:53:20.997 --> 00:53:23.433
REALLY INTRACTABLE HURDLES THAT

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:24.968
HAVE PROHIBITED THE PRIVATE

00:53:25.035 --> 00:53:26.636
SECTOR FROM PARTICIPATING. AND

00:53:26.703 --> 00:53:29.139
THAT'S AN IDEA OR NOTION WHERE

00:53:29.205 --> 00:53:30.206
THE PUBLIC AND THE PRIVATE

00:53:30.273 --> 00:53:31.541
COMING TOGETHER CREATES YOU

00:53:31.608 --> 00:53:33.310
KNOW ONE PLUS ONE IS FAR MORE

00:53:33.376 --> 00:53:38.181
THAN TWO. SO I'M JUST GOING NOW

00:53:38.248 --> 00:53:39.249
THE NUMBER OF I. TO MAYBE LIGHT

00:53:39.316 --> 00:53:41.418

SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND THE

00:56:39.796 --> 00:56:40.964
BLESSING SOMETHING DIFFERENT

00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:42.766
AGAIN. I THINK THAT ALL THAT

00:56:42.832 --> 00:56:43.733
WOULD DO IS SLOW DOWN THE

00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:44.968
PROCESS AND CALL AND CAUSE

00:56:45.034 --> 00:56:46.703
CONFUSION. SO WHAT I WOULD

00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:48.805
RATHER SEE AS A HARMONY OF

00:56:48.872 --> 00:56:51.941
ADOPTION. OF BUT A MANDATORY-

00:56:52.008 --> 00:56:53.510
PUSH PUSH FOR MANDATORY

00:56:53.576 --> 00:56:55.245
DISCLOSURE AND JUST BECAUSE I

00:56:55.311 --> 00:56:58.414
DO SAY WITHOUT- REQUIRING IT.

00:56:58.481 --> 00:57:00.250
YOU KNOW YOU DO LEAVE A LITTLE

00:57:00.316 --> 00:57:01.751
BIT OF A FREE OPTION THERE'S

00:57:01.818 --> 00:57:03.586
ALWAYS THE FREE RIDER RHYS. AND

00:57:03.653 --> 00:57:05.822
I ALSO THINK WITHOUT MAKING IT

00:57:05.889 --> 00:57:07.857
MANDATORY THEN YOU AREN'T BEING

00:57:07.924 --> 00:57:09.192
PRESCRIPTIVE ABOUT WHAT THOSE

00:57:09.259 --> 00:57:10.827
DISCLOSURES ARE AND THAT'S SO

00:57:10.894 --> 00:57:11.961
MUCH OF WHAT THE FINANCE

00:57:12.028 --> 00:57:13.863
COMMUNITIES ASKING FOR TO DRIVE

00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:15.431
AND SCALE MORE CAPITAL TO THE

00:57:15.498 --> 00:57:17.767
SPACE. SO AS AN EXAMPLE AND THE

00:57:17.834 --> 00:57:20.236
CORPORATE SPACE JUST TO MAYBE-

00:57:20.303 --> 00:57:21.471
MAKE IT TOO EASY TO BE A LOT

00:57:21.538 --> 00:57:23.506
EXAMPLE. IF AN INVESTOR TODAY

00:57:23.573 --> 00:57:25.775
SAYS I WOULD LIKE TO INVEST IN

00:57:25.842 --> 00:57:27.710
SUSTAINABLE LEADER AND ESG

00:57:27.777 --> 00:57:29.779
LEADER. AND THAT IS BECAUSE I

00:57:29.846 --> 00:57:31.247
BELIEVE THATTHESE LEADERS ARE

00:57:31.314 --> 00:57:32.348
GOING TO OUTPERFORM AND CREATE

00:57:32.415 --> 00:57:34.684
REAL VALUE. TODAY IN A GIVEN

00:57:34.751 --> 00:57:36.686
INDUSTRY IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT

00:57:36.753 --> 00:57:38.421
TWO COMPNIES SIDE BY SIDE IN

00:57:38.488 --> 00:57:39.756
TERMS OF THEIR SUSTAINABILITY

00:57:39.823 --> 00:57:41.724
DISCLOSURES. YOU WILL FIND

00:57:41.791 --> 00:57:43.159
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT METRICS

00:57:43.226 --> 00:57:44.661
THAT THEY DISCLOSE BECAUSE IT'S

00:57:44.727 --> 00:57:46.963
VOLUNTARY SO I'M SLIGHTLY

00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:48.198
CYNICAL OFTEN PROBABLY BUCKET

00:57:48.264 --> 00:57:50.066
GIVEN MARKETS FOR AS LONG AS I

00:57:50.133 --> 00:57:51.534
HAVE BEEN. BUT I TEND TO SAKE

00:57:51.601 --> 00:57:53.503
PEOPLE VOLUNTARILY DISCLOSE THE

00:57:53.570 --> 00:57:54.437
THINGS THEY'RE GOOD AT AND

00:57:54.504 --> 00:57:55.605
PROBABLY NOT DISCLOSING THE

00:57:55.672 --> 00:57:57.440
THINGSARE NOT SO GOOD AT. AND

00:57:57.507 --> 00:57:58.107
THAT'S NOT HELPFUL FOR THE

00:57:58.174 --> 00:57:59.809
FINANCIAL COMMUNITY SO THIS IS

00:57:59.876 --> 00:58:01.377
WHERE I THINK REGULATIONS VERY

00:58:01.444 --> 00:58:02.679
VERY IMPORTANT SO I WOULD

00:58:02.745 --> 00:58:06.516
ENCOURAGE BECAUSE TI CFG. IS

00:58:06.583 --> 00:58:08.852
REALLY TAKEN HOLD ON. NOW THERE

00:58:08.918 --> 00:58:14.958
ARE MORE THAN. TWO THOUSAND

00:58:15.024 --> 00:58:15.859
DIFFERENT ENTITY USE THAT ARE

00:58:15.925 --> 00:58:17.527
ADOPT T. C. MORE ABOUT HER AND

00:58:17.594 --> 00:58:18.995
SEVEN FIVE. TRILLION OF. A U.

00:58:19.062 --> 00:58:20.230
M. ASSETS UNDER. OF IN THE

00:58:20.296 --> 00:58:21.397
SERVICES IN. THEY'RE ADOPTING

00:58:21.464 --> 00:58:23.666
T. CFT CORPORATES ARE AND

00:58:23.733 --> 00:58:25.768
COUNTRIES. WE'VE SEEN EVEN THE

00:58:25.835 --> 00:58:27.637
DEVELOPING MARKETS YOU OFTEN

00:58:27.704 --> 00:58:28.638
WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE

00:58:28.705 --> 00:58:30.506
CONSIDERED TO BE SUSTAINABILITY

00:58:30.573 --> 00:58:32.041
LEADERS- THAT ARE THAT ARE

00:58:32.108 --> 00:58:33.610
FACING REAL CLIMATE ISSUES

00:58:33.676 --> 00:58:35.311
COUNTRIES LIKE BRAZIL. THEY'VE

00:58:35.378 --> 00:58:36.212
EVEN SAID THAT THEY WILL BE

00:58:36.279 --> 00:58:38.448
ADOPTING T. CFT SO I WOULD SAY

00:58:38.514 --> 00:58:40.683
TODAY. THE WORLD IS COALESCING

00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:42.619
AROUND THIS BEING ONE OF THE

00:58:42.685 --> 00:58:45.421
WAYS- THAT ONE CAN BE.

00:58:45.488 --> 00:58:47.523
DISCLOSING UNDER A CONSISTENT

00:58:47.590 --> 00:58:51.094
FRAMEWORK. THANK YOU SO. IN

00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:53.296
GENERAL I CERTAINLY. CAN

00:58:53.363 --> 00:58:55.531
APPRECIATE YOUR SUGGESTION THAT

00:58:55.598 --> 00:58:56.566
WE NEED TO HAVE COMMON

00:58:56.633 --> 00:58:58.501
STANDARDS I SHOULD ASSUME THAT

00:58:58.568 --> 00:59:00.370
MEANS COMMON DEFINITIONS ALSO.

00:59:00.436 --> 00:59:03.072
AND SO COULD YOU IF YOU KNOW

00:59:03.139 --> 00:59:05.108
NOW OR COULD YOU HELP US AS WE

00:59:05.174 --> 00:59:07.477
MOVE FORWARD. WITH WHERE DO WE

00:59:07.543 --> 00:59:09.646
GO TO MAKE SURE WE STAY AND

00:59:09.712 --> 00:59:11.681
SAYING WITH. THE DEVELOPMENT OF

00:59:11.748 --> 00:59:12.649
THOSE COMMON STANDARDS

00:59:12.715 --> 00:59:14.050
POTENTIALLY HAVE INPUT IN THOSE

00:59:14.117 --> 00:59:15.885
COMMON STANDARDS. DO YOU HAVE

00:59:15.952 --> 00:59:17.086
SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR US-

00:59:17.153 --> 00:59:18.788
BRIEFLY AND IF WE MAY NEED MORE

00:59:18.855 --> 00:59:21.291
TIME OFFLINE AFTER THIS BUT-

00:59:21.357 --> 00:59:22.592
HOW DOES THIS CALIFORNIA

00:59:22.659 --> 00:59:23.626
LEGISLATURE IF WE'RE

00:59:23.693 --> 00:59:29.198
INTERESTED. STAY IN SYNC. WITH

00:59:29.265 --> 00:59:29.799
ALL OF THE OTHER EFFORTS THAT

00:59:29.866 --> 00:59:30.433
ARE OUT THERE. ABSOLUTELY SO-

00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:31.301
CERTAINLY THE ONE THING I WOULD

00:59:31.367 --> 00:59:33.970
SAY AND- THIS IS ALSO I'D SAY

00:59:34.037 --> 00:59:36.539
ENDEMIC TO BEING VERY VERY FST

00:59:36.606 --> 00:59:38.308
GROWING FIELD. IS THAT THERE

00:59:38.374 --> 00:59:39.742
ARE- THERE'S BEEN A

00:59:39.809 --> 00:59:41.511
PROLIFERATION OF THOSE TRYING

00:59:41.577 --> 00:59:42.545
TO CREATE STANDARDS OF THEIR

00:59:42.612 --> 00:59:44.747
OWN- I THINK THINK JOKINGLY SAY

00:59:44.814 --> 00:59:45.748
THERE'S A COTTAGE INDUSTRY IN

00:59:45.815 --> 00:59:47.250
THE STANDARDS SETTING AND THE

00:59:47.317 --> 00:59:48.685
ESG RATING SERVICES AND

00:59:48.751 --> 00:59:51.487
CONSULTANCY IRAQI SG. AND AND

00:59:51.554 --> 00:59:52.889
THAT THAT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE

00:59:52.956 --> 00:59:54.257
OF THE ORGANIC GROWTH BUT AT

00:59:54.324 --> 00:59:55.491
THE SAME TIME WE ARE ALSO

00:59:55.558 --> 00:59:56.859
SEEING AS A CRY FOR

00:59:56.926 --> 00:59:57.860
CONSOLIDATION IN THE

00:59:57.927 --> 00:59:59.429
CONSOLIDATION OF HARMONIZATION

00:59:59.495 --> 01:00:01.030
IS HAPPENING. SO I WOULD SAY

01:00:01.097 --> 01:00:04.267
THE PREVAILING- STANDARDS THAT

01:00:04.334 --> 01:00:06.703
ARE EMERGING R. T. CFT SO I

01:00:06.769 --> 01:00:07.637
WOULD HIGHLYENCOURAGE THE

01:00:07.704 --> 01:00:08.972
LEGISLATURE TO GET FAMILIAR

01:00:09.038 --> 01:00:11.407
WITH THAT AND- ANTI CFT TASK

01:00:11.474 --> 01:00:13.009
FORCE WOULD BE I'M SURE

01:00:13.076 --> 01:00:15.144
THRILLED TO ENGAGE WITH YOU.

01:00:15.211 --> 01:00:17.113
AND SPEND TIME SO I THINK IT'S

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:19.048
SOMETHING LIKE A WORKSHOP. WITH

01:00:19.115 --> 01:00:21.217
IT WITH THE T. CFT WOULD BE I

01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:22.819
THINK HIGHLY BENEFICIAL FOR

01:00:22.885 --> 01:00:24.287
THOSE WILLING AND STARTED DOING

01:00:24.354 --> 01:00:25.855
A DEEPER DIVE. YOU KNOW WHAT IS

01:00:25.922 --> 01:00:26.889
GOOD PRACTICE LOOK LIKE IF

01:00:26.956 --> 01:00:28.725
COUNTRIES ARE DOING IT STATES

01:00:28.791 --> 01:00:30.159
CAN CERTAINLY DO IT RUN YOUR

01:00:30.226 --> 01:00:32.595
SCENARIO MODELING- AT WHERE

01:00:32.662 --> 01:00:34.330
YOUR EXPOSURES ARE IN JUST

01:00:34.397 --> 01:00:36.265
FORCING THE STATE TO THINK

01:00:36.332 --> 01:00:37.033
ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS BIGGEST

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:39.102
RISKS- YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S

01:00:39.168 --> 01:00:40.970
MORE WILDFIRES ARE WATER

01:00:41.037 --> 01:00:42.338
SHORTAGE OR RISING SEA LEVELS

01:00:42.405 --> 01:00:44.173
AFFECTING PHYSICAL ASSETS. BUT

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.042
ALSO WHERE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES

01:00:46.109 --> 01:00:47.477
WHERE CAN YOU TAKE THE THINGS

01:00:47.543 --> 01:00:49.879
THAT MAKE CALIFORNIA SO SPECIAL

01:00:49.946 --> 01:00:51.447
WHERE WHERE ARE YOUR MOST

01:00:51.514 --> 01:00:54.017
IMPORTANT INDUSTRIES- NOT ONLY

01:00:54.083 --> 01:00:54.817
LOOK AT IT WITH A RISK PLANS

01:00:54.884 --> 01:00:56.486
BUT AN OPPORTUNITY LET SO I

01:00:56.552 --> 01:00:57.053
THINK ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:59.455
SILICON VALLEY- AND THE YOU

01:00:59.522 --> 01:01:01.491
KNOW WONDERFUL TECH SECTOR THAT

01:01:01.557 --> 01:01:02.225
HAS BEEN SUCH A PART OF

01:01:02.291 --> 01:01:04.394
CALIFORNIA'S HERITAGE. AND SO

01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:06.029
YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE U. S. B.

01:01:06.095 --> 01:01:08.498
WELL WHAT ABOUT REALLY PUSHING

01:01:08.564 --> 01:01:09.866
AS AN OPPORTUNITY SET.

01:01:09.932 --> 01:01:11.367
SOMETHING LIKE THE GREEN TAX

01:01:11.434 --> 01:01:13.503
BASE IN A VERY FORCEFUL AND

01:01:13.569 --> 01:01:16.205
VERY VOCAL WAY- I CAN CERTAINLY

01:01:16.272 --> 01:01:17.974
SAY I'M AN OPPORTUNITY SIDE THE

01:01:18.041 --> 01:01:18.941
MOVING A LITTLE BIT AWAY FROM

01:01:19.008 --> 01:01:20.977
DISCLOSURES BUT I'M SAYING IN

01:01:21.044 --> 01:01:21.611
TERMS OF THINGS WHERE YOU COULD

01:01:21.677 --> 01:01:23.913
JAM. SORT OF I LOOK AT. THE

01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:25.882
VARIOUS OTHER INITIATIVES AND

01:01:25.948 --> 01:01:32.522
THINK ABOUT WHAT'S. GOING TO BE

01:01:32.588 --> 01:01:34.724
UNIQUE TO YOU- YOU CAN YOU CAN-A LOOK AT- TO AND THEY-

01:01:34.791 --> 01:01:36.225
OPPORTUNITIES CAN. ALL SOME OF

01:01:36.292 --> 01:01:37.994
THESE. WERE CHALLENGES THAT BE

01:01:38.061 --> 01:01:38.761
ANOTHER PLAY WHERE I CAN THAT

01:01:38.828 --> 01:01:39.962
NON HEALTH COULD BE VERY

01:01:40.029 --> 01:01:40.897
INVESTED. BUT TO THIS CONCERT

01:01:40.963 --> 01:01:43.032
OF- THESE OTHERS. AND DAY SO

01:01:43.099 --> 01:01:45.334
YOU TO SEE. THE OTHER ONE THAT

01:01:45.401 --> 01:01:47.637
IS. BECOMING VERY IMPORTANT IS

01:01:47.703 --> 01:01:49.572
SAYS BECAUSE THE STAND OF ALL

01:01:49.639 --> 01:01:51.674
ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD.

01:01:51.741 --> 01:01:52.675
THAT AGAIN IS A VOLUNTARY

01:01:52.742 --> 01:01:54.644
ORGANISATION MOSTLY DESIGNED

01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:56.279
FOR CORPORATES. AND IT'S AND

01:01:56.345 --> 01:01:58.614
IT'S EFFECTIVELY- GOES BY

01:01:58.681 --> 01:02:01.184
INDUSTRY. AND SAYS- FOR THOSE

01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:03.152
WHO JOIN SAYS B. WE HAVE

01:02:03.219 --> 01:02:05.088
IDENTIFIED THE MOST FINANCIALLY

01:02:05.154 --> 01:02:07.924
MATERIAL SUSTAINABILITY FACTORS

01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:09.425
FOR A GIVEN INDUSTRY. AND WE

01:02:09.492 --> 01:02:10.626
WOULD HOPE AND EXPECT THAT THE

01:02:10.693 --> 01:02:12.328
COMPANIES WOULD BEGIN TO

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:14.230
DISCLOSE THOSE METRICS SO WE

01:02:14.297 --> 01:02:15.531
HAVE THAT COMMONALITY AND

01:02:15.598 --> 01:02:17.100
COMPARABILITY FOR INVESTMENT

01:02:17.166 --> 01:02:19.769
COMMUNITY. AND I THINK- FOR THE

01:02:19.836 --> 01:02:21.537
CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE IF YOU

01:02:21.604 --> 01:02:22.672
LOOK AT WHAT THOSE MEANT

01:02:22.738 --> 01:02:24.607
METRICS ARE. FOR THE GIVEN

01:02:24.674 --> 01:02:25.508
INDUSTRIES THAT ARE MOST

01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:26.909
IMPORTANT THE CALIFORNIA

01:02:26.976 --> 01:02:29.378
ECONOMY. THAT WILL POINT YOU TO

01:02:29.445 --> 01:02:30.213
THE PLACES WHERE DISCLOSURE

01:02:30.279 --> 01:02:32.381
MIGHT BE PROMOTED. WHAT ARE THE

01:02:32.448 --> 01:02:34.117
KEY LINE ITEMS THAT ARE GOING

01:02:34.183 --> 01:02:35.485
TO BE MOST CRITICAL FOR YOUR

01:02:35.551 --> 01:02:37.320
GIVEN KEY INDUSTRIES. THAT'S

01:02:37.386 --> 01:02:38.754
ANOTHER PLACE WHERE I THINK-

01:02:38.821 --> 01:02:40.857
YOU COULD EDUCATE YOURSELF ON.

01:02:40.923 --> 01:02:43.359
ON STANDARD SETTING- SO I YOU

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:44.494
KNOW THERE ARE MANY MORE THAT I

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:45.495
COULD POINT TO I DON'T WANT TO

01:02:45.561 --> 01:02:46.762
HIJACK THE WHOLE CONVERSATION

01:02:46.829 --> 01:02:47.930
ON JUSTICE STANDARDS TOPIC

01:02:47.997 --> 01:02:49.866
SHOULD BUT- WHAT WE ARE SEEING

01:02:49.932 --> 01:02:52.235
FOR SURE. IS A HARMONIZATION

01:02:52.301 --> 01:02:54.504
CONSOLIDATION AND THERE WILL BE

01:02:54.570 --> 01:02:56.639
A MERGING LEADERS. AND I ALSO

01:02:56.706 --> 01:02:58.107
THINK THAT THERE WILL BE GLOBAL

01:02:58.174 --> 01:03:00.543
STANDARDS FOR WHAT IS MANDATORY

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:01.344
AND I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE THE

01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:08.518
STATE TO. TO FOLLOW ON RATHER.

01:03:08.584 --> 01:03:09.185
THAN TRY TO. REINVENT THE WHEEL.

01:03:09.252 --> 01:03:09.752
THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'M

01:03:09.819 --> 01:03:10.386
GOING TO NOW TURN OVER TO THE

01:03:10.453 --> 01:03:11.621
CHIU OF OUR- ASSEMBLY BY

01:03:11.687 --> 01:03:14.757
COMMITTEE MISS GRACE. FOR HIS

01:03:14.824 --> 01:03:15.892
QUESTIONS. FIRST OF ALL THANK

01:03:15.958 --> 01:03:16.792
YOU MISTER FOR YOUR

01:03:16.859 --> 01:03:18.461
PRESENTATION VERY VERY

01:03:18.528 --> 01:03:20.796
INSIGHTFUL AND THAT EDUCATING

01:03:20.863 --> 01:03:22.265
AND I APPRECIATE THE

01:03:22.331 --> 01:03:24.534
INFORMATION. THAT YOU SHARED-

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:25.635
JUST HEARING YOUR LAST WORDS

01:03:25.701 --> 01:03:30.706
HERE- WAS WAS- IT COST

01:03:30.773 --> 01:03:32.642
POSITIVELY BECAUSE AYE AYE I

01:03:32.708 --> 01:03:34.844
WANNA KNOW. THE IMPORTANCE FROM

01:03:34.911 --> 01:03:36.445
YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND FROM YOUR

01:03:36.512 --> 01:03:39.282
LANDS- YOU SPOKE OF THE KIND OF

01:03:39.348 --> 01:03:40.917
THE COLLEGE ENVIRONMENT WHEN IT

01:03:40.983 --> 01:03:43.052
COMES TO FORMING STANDARDS AND-

01:03:43.119 --> 01:03:44.053
AND IT REALLY DOES MAKE A CASE

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:46.589
FOR. A CENTRAL AGENCY TO GET

01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:48.324
INVOLVED TO CREATE THAT

01:03:48.391 --> 01:03:50.459
CONSISTENCY ESPECIALLY IF WE'RE

01:03:50.526 --> 01:03:54.197
TALKING- GLOBAL AND I THINK WE

01:03:54.263 --> 01:03:55.998
LOOK WE ARE IN THAT KIND OF

01:03:56.065 --> 01:03:57.300
ENVIRONMENT RIGHT NOW THAT

01:03:57.366 --> 01:04:00.436
EVERYTHING IS GLOBAL SO. HAVING

01:04:00.503 --> 01:04:03.706
SAID THAT WE CAN GOVERNMENT AT

01:04:03.773 --> 01:04:04.974
TIMES GET WAY AHEAD OF OUR

01:04:05.041 --> 01:04:08.544
SELF. AND SO WHAT I'M ASKING IS

01:04:08.611 --> 01:04:10.213
WHEN IT COMES TO DEFINITIONS

01:04:10.279 --> 01:04:12.615
AND FORMING THOSE CATEGORIES

01:04:12.682 --> 01:04:13.382
THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT IN YOUR

01:04:13.449 --> 01:04:17.520
PRESENTATION. DO YOU SEE- BOB

01:04:17.587 --> 01:04:19.922
HAPPENING MORE EFFICIENTLY ON A

01:04:19.989 --> 01:04:23.459
LINEAR- SETTING OR OR PLATFORM

01:04:23.526 --> 01:04:24.894
OR IS THIS SOMETHING THAT CAN

01:04:24.961 --> 01:04:27.396
BE DONE LIKE A BUFFET WHERE ALL

01:04:27.463 --> 01:04:29.232
THE IDEAS ARE OUT THERE. AND

01:04:29.298 --> 01:04:30.733
WE'RE JUST WE'RE WE'RE TAKING

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:32.668
WHAT WE CAN GET AT THE TIME AND

01:04:32.735 --> 01:04:34.303
PUTTING TOGETHER THE PROGRAM

01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:36.105
HOW IMPORTANT IS IT TO BE ABLE

01:04:36.172 --> 01:04:37.773
TO HAVE THOSE DEFINITIONS. AND

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:39.609
THOSE CATEGORIES SET IN STONE

01:04:39.675 --> 01:04:41.777
FIRST BEFORE OTHER THINGS

01:04:41.844 --> 01:04:43.980
HAPPEN. IT'S A REALLY GREAT

01:04:44.046 --> 01:04:45.481
QUESTION BECAUSE IS A VERY VERY

01:04:45.548 --> 01:04:47.683
DYNAMIC SPACE AND YOU CAN

01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:48.184
SOMETHING AS WHAT IS THE

01:04:48.251 --> 01:04:49.685
DEFINITION OF GREEN. THERE ARE

01:04:49.752 --> 01:04:52.121
SOME INDUSTRIES TODAY THAT DO

01:04:52.188 --> 01:04:54.590
NOT HAVE A GREEN PATHWAY TO NET

01:04:54.657 --> 01:04:56.759
ZERO OR PERSONAL LINES. AND SO

01:04:56.826 --> 01:04:58.728
WHAT WE WANT TO PROMOTE IT AND

01:04:58.794 --> 01:05:00.630
NOT VERY SPECIFIC EXAMPLE OUR

01:05:00.696 --> 01:05:03.499
PATHWAYS WERE WERE TRANSITION.

01:05:03.566 --> 01:05:04.767
EXERCISE ON THE PORT OF

01:05:04.834 --> 01:05:06.569
CORPORATES IN THOSE INDUSTRIES

01:05:06.636 --> 01:05:07.970
TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S GREENER

01:05:08.037 --> 01:05:09.538
THAN WHAT THEY'RE DOING TODAY

01:05:09.605 --> 01:05:10.840
BUT WE MAY NOT HAVE THE

01:05:10.906 --> 01:05:12.375
GREENEST ANSWER BECAUSE THAT'S

01:05:12.441 --> 01:05:13.242
GOING TO BE RELIANT ON

01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:15.244
TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION. SO

01:05:15.311 --> 01:05:16.579
WHAT I WOULD SAY IS WE DON'T

01:05:16.646 --> 01:05:18.114
WANT THE PERFECT BE THE ENEMY

01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:19.515
OF THE GOOD SO I DO THINK IT'S

01:05:19.582 --> 01:05:20.716
VERY IMPORTANT TO GET STARTED

01:05:20.783 --> 01:05:22.518
ON THE JOURNEY. AND NOT WAIT

01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:24.053
TILL WE HAVE A PERFECTLY FORMED

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:25.688
BEAST BUT AT THE SAME TIME I

01:05:25.755 --> 01:05:27.423
THINK WE DO NEED TO CONTINUE TO

01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:29.392
PUSH. ALL OF US IN WHATEVER

01:05:29.458 --> 01:05:32.962
PART OF- THE EQUATION WE FIND

01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:34.330
OURSELVES AND WHETHER IT'S

01:05:34.397 --> 01:05:35.398
POLICY MAKING OR THE FINANCIAL

01:05:35.464 --> 01:05:37.133
SERVICES INDUSTRY OR CORPORATE.

01:05:37.199 --> 01:05:38.367
I DO THINK WE WANT TO PROMOTE

01:05:38.434 --> 01:05:40.536
HARMONY. ACROSS WHEN WE DO

01:05:40.603 --> 01:05:41.671
SETTLE ON WHAT THESE

01:05:41.737 --> 01:05:43.839
DEFINITIONS ARE SO I WOULD SAY

01:05:43.906 --> 01:05:45.608
LET'S GO AND YOU SHOULD

01:05:45.675 --> 01:05:47.009
INTERPRET WHAT GREEN MEANS TO

01:05:47.076 --> 01:05:49.045
YOU IF THAT'S- AN AREA THAT YOU

01:05:49.111 --> 01:05:49.845
WANT TO BE FOCUSED IN OR

01:05:49.912 --> 01:05:52.181
SOCIAL. OR WHAT HAVE YOU AND TO

01:05:52.248 --> 01:05:53.883
FIND OUT WHAT THAT MEANS TO YOU

01:05:53.949 --> 01:05:55.284
AND THE WAY I INTERPRET THAT IN

01:05:55.351 --> 01:05:56.919
SEATTLE SERVICES I SAY IN THE

01:05:56.986 --> 01:05:59.255
ABSENCE. OF A GLOBAL DEFINITION

01:05:59.322 --> 01:06:01.390
FOR GREEN I HAVE TO SAY WHAT I

01:06:01.457 --> 01:06:02.925
THINK GREEN MEANS IN MY

01:06:02.992 --> 01:06:04.193
INVESTMENTS THAT I'M CREATING

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:05.828
FOR MY CLIENTS AT THE VERY

01:06:05.895 --> 01:06:08.197
TRANSPARENT ABOUT WHAT THAT IS

01:06:08.264 --> 01:06:10.132
AND WHAT IT'S NOT. AND THEN I

01:06:10.199 --> 01:06:11.300
ALLOW MY INVESTORS ARE MY

01:06:11.367 --> 01:06:13.069
CLIENTS TO PARTICIPATE WITH

01:06:13.135 --> 01:06:15.204
THAT FULL KNOWLEDGE AND THAT'S

01:06:15.271 --> 01:06:17.940
WOULD BE MY BEST ADVICE NOW IS

01:06:18.007 --> 01:06:21.444
TO GET GOING. PUSH YOURSELF TO

01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:24.347
IN THE DIRECTION OF WHERE YOU

01:06:24.413 --> 01:06:31.287
WERE. AND UP. AND THEN YOU KNOW

01:06:31.354 --> 01:06:43.966
I THE WORLD WILL COME. TO I

01:06:44.033 --> 01:06:47.069
KNOW THAT MANY- ARE SKEPTICAL.

01:06:47.136 --> 01:06:48.871
OF COMBINING THE GOAL OF MARKET

01:06:48.938 --> 01:06:50.840
RETURNS WITH- THE GOAL OF

01:06:50.906 --> 01:06:51.974
SUSTAINABILITY AND SOCIAL

01:06:52.041 --> 01:06:55.378
CHANGE. IS THAT SKEPTICISM A

01:06:55.444 --> 01:06:58.047
REAL BARRIER OR- AND THEN ALSO

01:06:58.114 --> 01:06:59.415
WHAT WOULD BE SOME OF THE OTHER

01:06:59.482 --> 01:07:02.251
CHALLENGES. THAT YOU SEE TOWARD

01:07:02.318 --> 01:07:04.120
MORE WIDESPREAD ADOPTION OF

01:07:04.186 --> 01:07:06.722
IMPACTING OR IMPACT VEST

01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:10.192
INVESTING. SURE SO- I WOULD SAY

01:07:10.259 --> 01:07:11.660
IF YOU HAD LOOKED BACK SEVERAL

01:07:11.727 --> 01:07:13.329
YEARS THERE WAS AN ENORMOUS

01:07:13.396 --> 01:07:15.297
AMOUNT OF CYNICSM BECAUSE WE

01:07:15.364 --> 01:07:16.799
WERE ALL TAUGHT ANY OF US THAT

01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:18.100
YOU KNOW WE'RE IN THE- IN THE

01:07:18.167 --> 01:07:20.202
FINANCE WORLD SELF INCLUDED YOU

01:07:20.269 --> 01:07:21.337
KNOW IT IT WORKING WHEN I GOT

01:07:21.404 --> 01:07:23.539
MY MBA WE NEVER TALKED ABOUT.

01:07:23.606 --> 01:07:25.441
PURPOSE DRIVEN FINANCE OR

01:07:25.508 --> 01:07:26.642
VALUES ALIGNMENT WITH YOUR

01:07:26.709 --> 01:07:28.344
INVESTING OR COULD YOU ONLINE

01:07:28.411 --> 01:07:30.546
PURPOSE AND PROFIT FOR POSITIVE

01:07:30.613 --> 01:07:32.548
OUTCOMES THAT A RETURN. IT JUST

01:07:32.615 --> 01:07:33.949
WASN'T SOMETHING THAT WAS IN

01:07:34.016 --> 01:07:36.385
THE FRAME OF REFERENCE BUT NOW

01:07:36.452 --> 01:07:38.587
I THINK TODAY WHERE WE ARE IS

01:07:38.654 --> 01:07:40.022
THAT THERE THERE'S ENOUGH

01:07:40.089 --> 01:07:41.991
MATURITY IN THIS IMPACTS BASED

01:07:42.057 --> 01:07:43.125
ON THE BROADER SUSTAINABILITY

01:07:43.192 --> 01:07:45.261
FIELD THAT WE HAVE A REAL PROOF

01:07:45.327 --> 01:07:46.729
POINTS WE HAVE EXCELLENT

01:07:46.796 --> 01:07:48.664
DEMONSTRATION. OF WHERE WE HAVE

01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:50.366
CHEAT SHEET NOT ONLY MARKET

01:07:50.433 --> 01:07:51.600
RATES OF RETURN FOR VARIOUS

01:07:51.667 --> 01:07:55.037
ASSET CLASSES BUT-OUTPERFORMANCE BY COMBINING BY

01:07:55.104 --> 01:07:57.406
TAKING THAT YES SHE LANDS AND

01:07:57.473 --> 01:07:59.408
RUNNING ACROSS OUR INVESTMENTS

01:07:59.475 --> 01:08:00.743
OR INDEED GOING FRTHER AND

01:08:00.810 --> 01:08:02.011
SAYING I WANT TO ACHIEVE

01:08:02.077 --> 01:08:03.946
DELIVERED OUTCOMES. AND I THINK

01:08:04.013 --> 01:08:05.815
WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO CHEAT

01:08:05.881 --> 01:08:06.816
THESE POSITIVE OUTCOMES THAT

01:08:06.882 --> 01:08:08.818
YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT IMPACT

01:08:08.884 --> 01:08:10.619
YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE. IT OFTEN

01:08:10.686 --> 01:08:12.121
LEADS YOU INTO INTERESTING

01:08:12.188 --> 01:08:13.489
PLACES THAT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE

01:08:13.556 --> 01:08:16.459
OTHERWISE THOUGHT ABOUT- AND

01:08:16.525 --> 01:08:17.827
THEN WHAT HAPPENS AS AN

01:08:17.893 --> 01:08:19.595
INVESTOR AND I OFTEN SAY THE

01:08:19.662 --> 01:08:21.831
CYNICISM BEGINS WITH CAN YOU

01:08:21.897 --> 01:08:23.966
REALLY DO IT. I ALWAYS AND

01:08:24.033 --> 01:08:25.701
CHALLENGE PEOPLE TO SAY WELL

01:08:25.768 --> 01:08:26.936
I'M IN A POSITIVE PIECES THAT

01:08:27.002 --> 01:08:28.370
YOU CAN SO IF YOU GIVE ME A

01:08:28.437 --> 01:08:30.172
LITTLE CAPITAL AND LET ME GIVE

01:08:30.239 --> 01:08:32.141
IT A TRY AND I CAN PROVE TO

01:08:32.208 --> 01:08:33.576
YOU. THAT NOT ONLY CAN I

01:08:33.642 --> 01:08:35.044
GENERATE AT THE VERY MINIMUM

01:08:35.110 --> 01:08:36.779
MARKET RATE OF RETURN BUT I CAN

01:08:36.846 --> 01:08:41.851
ALSO HAVE. A POSITIVE IMPACT ON

01:08:41.917 --> 01:08:42.418
THE WORLD. HOW CAN YOU KNOW

01:08:42.485 --> 01:08:43.018
LIKE THAT LET'S NOT TO LOVE.

01:08:43.085 --> 01:08:44.820
AND AT THAT SITTING GO THAT

01:08:44.887 --> 01:08:47.723
STEP. ONCE YOU PROVE IT TO THEM

01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:49.425
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN I FIND

01:08:49.492 --> 01:08:50.759
THOSE CYNICS BECOME YOUR

01:08:50.826 --> 01:08:52.394
GREATEST CONVERTS AND THEY

01:08:52.461 --> 01:08:54.597
BECOME AMBASSADORS FOR THE

01:08:54.663 --> 01:08:56.332
OVERALL SECTOR. BECAUSE THEY

01:08:56.398 --> 01:08:57.867
ARE SO THRILLED WITH THE FACT

01:08:57.933 --> 01:08:59.568
THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO POSITIVE

01:08:59.635 --> 01:09:02.404
REVIEWS. WITH CAPITAL SO WHAT

01:09:02.471 --> 01:09:03.973
I'M SAYING IS THAT TODAY WERE

01:09:04.039 --> 01:09:05.374
IN A PLACE WHERE WE HAVE MANY

01:09:05.441 --> 01:09:06.542
GROUP POINTS ACROSS ASSET

01:09:06.609 --> 01:09:08.377
CLASSES. WE ALSO HAVE A GREAT

01:09:08.444 --> 01:09:10.179
GROUP POINTS THROUGH THE CYCLE.

01:09:10.246 --> 01:09:11.547
WOULDN'T WE'VE HIT THE WORST OF

01:09:11.614 --> 01:09:12.915
THE WORST AND CO THAT BACK IN

01:09:12.982 --> 01:09:14.083
MARCH OF LAST YEAR WHEN THE

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:15.317
MARKETS WERE JUST GETTING

01:09:15.384 --> 01:09:17.186
ABSOLUTELY HIT. THROUGH THE

01:09:17.253 --> 01:09:19.288
FEAR ENDS AND THE RESPONSE TO

01:09:19.355 --> 01:09:21.257
COALBED. WE SOLVED THIS IS

01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:23.125
SCALABLE STRATEGIES AND SO MANY

01:09:23.192 --> 01:09:25.828
IMPACT STRATEGIES OUTPERFORMED

01:09:25.895 --> 01:09:27.396
FAIRLY SUBSTANTIALLY MEETING

01:09:27.463 --> 01:09:29.298
PLACE. NOT JUST IN THE WORST OF

01:09:29.365 --> 01:09:30.733
THE CRISIS BUT THROUGH THE

01:09:30.799 --> 01:09:32.434
RECOVERY PERIOD AS WELL SO I

01:09:32.501 --> 01:09:33.736
THINK THERE'S AND WHEN WE TALK

01:09:33.802 --> 01:09:35.070
ABOUT RISK ADJUSTED RETURN

01:09:35.137 --> 01:09:37.239
RESILIENCY. YEAH WE ALSO HAVE

01:09:37.306 --> 01:09:38.274
TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION IT'S

01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:40.442
NOT JUST HEALTH OUTPERFORMANCE

01:09:40.509 --> 01:09:42.344
IT'S ALSO RISK ADJUSTED

01:09:42.411 --> 01:09:44.613
RETURNS- RETURN MEDICATION. AND

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:46.181
SO- AND THEN THE FINAL PIECE I

01:09:46.248 --> 01:09:47.683
WOULD POINT TO AS WELL AS IN

01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:49.618
ANY GOOD INVESTING STRATEGY.

01:09:49.685 --> 01:09:49.985
YOU WANT TO HAVE

01:09:50.052 --> 01:09:51.921
DIVERSIFICATION. AND OFTEN

01:09:51.987 --> 01:09:53.589
THINKING ABOUT IMPACT NEEDS YOU

01:09:53.656 --> 01:09:54.723
AS A STATE TO PLACES THAT YOU

01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:56.559
HADN'T THOUGHT OF BEFORE AND IN

01:09:56.625 --> 01:09:58.460
A GOOD PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION.

01:09:58.527 --> 01:10:00.763
YOU WANT TO HAVE A DIVERSE SET

01:10:00.829 --> 01:10:01.830
OF OPPORTUNITIES THAT YOU'RE

01:10:01.897 --> 01:10:03.966
INVESTED IN. THIS IS A MERGING

01:10:04.033 --> 01:10:06.502
IMPACT SPACE. ISN'T SO CROWDED

01:10:06.569 --> 01:10:07.937
SO OFTEN TIMES THAT THE

01:10:08.003 --> 01:10:08.737
INVESTMENTS THAT YOU CAN GET

01:10:08.804 --> 01:10:11.140
INVOLVED IN. I DON'T HAVE HUGE

01:10:11.206 --> 01:10:12.708
BIDS FOR THEM THAT THE ASSETS

01:10:12.775 --> 01:10:14.276
AREN'T OVERPRICED SO THE

01:10:14.343 --> 01:10:16.045
OPPORTUNITY GREAT VALUE ALONG

01:10:16.111 --> 01:10:17.813
THE WAY AS AN INVESTOR IS VERY

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.448
MUCH THERE WE CALL THAT THE-

01:10:19.515 --> 01:10:21.417
THE OUR TRANSITION IMPROVERS.

01:10:21.483 --> 01:10:23.285
NOT GENERATING THAT VALUE AS AS

01:10:23.352 --> 01:10:23.953
THEY'RE ON THAT TRANSITION

01:10:24.019 --> 01:10:25.754
JOURNEY. YOU ASKED ABOUT OTHER

01:10:25.821 --> 01:10:28.290
HURDLES- CLEARLY IN MY OPINION

01:10:28.357 --> 01:10:29.725
ONE OF THE BIGGEST ONES IS THIS

01:10:29.792 --> 01:10:31.293
LACK OF A COMMON DEFINITION FOR

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:32.661
WHAT IS SUSTAINABLE OR WHAT IS

01:10:32.728 --> 01:10:34.763
GREEN OR WHAT IS IMPACT. BUT AS

01:10:34.830 --> 01:10:36.098
I SAY THERE ARE MANY GREAT

01:10:36.165 --> 01:10:37.499
MINDS ARE AT WORK TRYING TO

01:10:37.566 --> 01:10:44.640
DEFINE THAT. AND. WE'LL GET

01:10:44.707 --> 01:10:45.274
THERE IN TIME AND AGAIN THAT'S-

01:10:45.341 --> 01:10:45.908
VERY MUCH THE SIDE OF A MATURE

01:10:45.975 --> 01:10:46.809
SPACE. HAVING BEEN IN THE FROM

01:10:46.875 --> 01:10:48.210
YEARS AS I WAS. EARLIEST ASSET

01:10:48.277 --> 01:10:50.145
CLASSES LARGE- ONE OF THE- TO

01:10:50.212 --> 01:10:51.480
UNLOCKING SCALE. WAS TO GET O

01:10:51.547 --> 01:10:54.016
COMMON. AND A COMMON ADAPTION

01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:55.184
OF. SHALL WE SAY WHAT GOOD

01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:57.219
LOOKS LIKE. IN A GIVEN SPACE

01:10:57.286 --> 01:10:58.687
BUT WE WILL GET THERE. I WOULD

01:10:58.754 --> 01:11:00.889
SAY THE FINAL SPACE- YOU KNOW

01:11:00.956 --> 01:11:05.294
WHERE WE SEE HURDLES- IS JUST-

01:11:05.361 --> 01:11:10.766
THE- THE ABILITY TO- DENTED TO

01:11:10.833 --> 01:11:13.535
MEASURE. THE OUTCOME SO

01:11:13.602 --> 01:11:15.437
SOMETIMES MEASUREMENT AS WELL

01:11:15.504 --> 01:11:16.639
AS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER

01:11:16.705 --> 01:11:19.675
SO IF YOU ARE MAKING AN IMPACT

01:11:19.742 --> 01:11:20.442
INVESTMENT IN TRYING TO ACHIEVE

01:11:20.509 --> 01:11:23.445
AN OUTCOME- YOU NEED TO BE ABLE

01:11:23.512 --> 01:11:24.213
TO BE RIGOROUS ABOUT WHAT

01:11:24.279 --> 01:11:26.181
YOU'RE MEASURING. AND YOU ALSO

01:11:26.248 --> 01:11:27.449
NEED TO BE SOMEWHAT FLEXIBLE

01:11:27.516 --> 01:11:28.484
BECAUSE SOME OF THESE

01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:30.185
INVESTMENTS AS IN THIS DYNAMIC

01:11:30.252 --> 01:11:31.720
SPACE THAT WE'RE IN YOU LEARN

01:11:31.787 --> 01:11:33.622
AS YOU GO. SO WHAT IS THE BEST

01:11:33.689 --> 01:11:35.024
OUTCOME YOU MIGHT HAVE TO HIT

01:11:35.090 --> 01:11:36.392
IT OR TWEAK YOUR STRATEGY A

01:11:36.458 --> 01:11:37.793
LITTLE BIT TO ACTUALLY CHEAP

01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:39.628
HILLS MALCOLM THAT YOU NEED. SO

01:11:39.695 --> 01:11:40.829
ON THE ONE HAND YOU HAVE TO

01:11:40.896 --> 01:11:42.064
HOLD YOURSELF TO A VERY HIGH

01:11:42.131 --> 01:11:43.132
ACCOUNT AND WHAT YOU'RE

01:11:43.198 --> 01:11:44.066
MEASURING AND WHAT YOU'RE

01:11:44.133 --> 01:11:45.534
REPORTING ON. ON THE OTHER HAND

01:11:45.601 --> 01:11:46.802
YOU HAVE TO GIVE YOURSELF THE

01:11:46.869 --> 01:11:48.737
NEXT FOR A NETFLIX ABILITY TO

01:11:48.804 --> 01:11:49.738
TWEAK AND ADJUST YOUR BUSINESS

01:11:49.805 --> 01:11:51.507
PLAN BUSINESS MODEL TO PURSUE

01:11:51.573 --> 01:11:53.509
WHAT WORKS. AND SO I THINK

01:11:53.575 --> 01:11:54.677
THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT-

01:11:54.743 --> 01:11:57.346
WALKOM AS AS THE SPACE-

01:11:57.413 --> 01:11:58.580
CONTINUES TO MATURE AND

01:11:58.647 --> 01:12:00.416
MAINSTREAM. BUT TODAY THOSE ARE

01:12:00.482 --> 01:12:04.420
SOME OF OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGES.

01:12:04.486 --> 01:12:05.521
THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU

01:12:05.587 --> 01:12:07.956

SILVA MEMBERS. WE NORMALLY

01:12:12.261 --> 01:12:13.962
DON'T HAVE A DISCUSSION AT

01:12:14.029 --> 01:12:15.664
COMMITTEE HEARINGS- WE HAVE

01:12:15.731 --> 01:12:16.765
SORT OF FORMAL QUESTION TOOK

THE EXTENT THAT- YOU'RE WILLING

01:12:23.205 --> 01:12:24.306
TO IT. I THINK IT COULD BE A

01:12:24.373 --> 01:12:25.774
GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO

01:12:25.841 --> 01:12:28.944
HAVE- THIS THIS OF THIS- CALM

01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:30.379
KIND OF CONVERSATION WHICH WE

THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER I.

GREATLY APPRECIATE YOUR-

01:12:48.197 --> 01:12:50.032
PERSPECTIVE I THINK IT'S

01:12:50.099 --> 01:12:50.933
EXACTLY THE PRODUCTS WE NEED TO

01:12:50.999 --> 01:12:54.336
TAKE- I KIND OF WANT TO TAKE.

01:12:54.403 --> 01:12:57.372
IT TANGENTIAL QUESTION- THERE'S

01:12:57.439 --> 01:12:59.441
KIND OF A RELATED DEBATE I KNOW

01:12:59.508 --> 01:13:02.311
IN IN CAPITAL MARKETS THEORY.

01:13:02.377 --> 01:13:04.279
AROUND WHETHER OUR MARKETS ARE

01:13:04.346 --> 01:13:05.280
TOO SHORT TERM IN THEIR

01:13:05.347 --> 01:13:07.282
OUTLOOK. AND I'M WONDERING TO

01:13:07.349 --> 01:13:08.584
WHAT DEGREE THIS IS TIED TO

01:13:08.650 --> 01:13:09.985
THAT AND I GUESS WHAT I'M

01:13:10.052 --> 01:13:10.452
THINKING ABOUT THIS IN

01:13:10.519 --> 01:13:12.988
PARTICULAR. YOU KNOW I'M

01:13:13.055 --> 01:13:14.123
IMAGINING LIKE WE NEED A LOT OF

01:13:14.189 --> 01:13:16.024
MONEY. ONCE AND R. AND B. AND

01:13:16.091 --> 01:13:17.059
THINGS LIKE THAT YOU MENTIONED

01:13:17.126 --> 01:13:18.660
GREENTECH AND I THINK THAT'S

01:13:18.727 --> 01:13:20.796
EXACTLY RIGHT WE NEED. THAT

01:13:20.863 --> 01:13:22.731
CAPITAL GO THERE AND PRIVATE

01:13:22.798 --> 01:13:24.666
CAPITAL. COULD COULD REALLY

01:13:24.733 --> 01:13:26.869
FLOOD THE ZONE HERE. BUT THAT

01:13:26.935 --> 01:13:28.170
TYPE OF INVESTMENT HAS SUCH A

01:13:28.237 --> 01:13:30.839
LONG TERM OUTLOOK- AND WHEN I

01:13:30.906 --> 01:13:32.508
THINK OF U. S. CAPITAL MARKETS

01:13:32.574 --> 01:13:34.109
TODAY I THINK OF GAME STOP AND

01:13:34.176 --> 01:13:35.911
DOES KOREAN. YOU KNOW A VERY

01:13:35.978 --> 01:13:42.317
SHORT TERM IS. ALEX HAD HOW DO

01:13:42.384 --> 01:13:44.219
WE IN THE GOVERNMENT. ACTUALLY

01:13:44.286 --> 01:13:45.354
MOVE TO LONG TERM OUTLOOKS A

01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:46.755
AND ONE. WOULD AN EMPHASIS ON

01:13:46.822 --> 01:13:48.957
ON MAYBE. LONG TERM CASH- TAX

01:13:49.024 --> 01:13:50.659
POLICY OTHERWISE. AND PUNISHING

01:13:50.726 --> 01:13:52.761
SHORT TERM HORIZONS ALSO HAVE.

01:13:52.828 --> 01:13:54.863
POSITIVE IMPACTS ON ON GREEN

01:13:54.930 --> 01:13:57.666
INVESTMENTS ON ON THE TYPES OF

01:13:57.733 --> 01:13:58.200
PRIORITIES YOU'RE YOU'RE

01:13:58.267 --> 01:14:00.402
LOOKING AT AS WELL. YES YEAH

01:14:00.469 --> 01:14:01.570
WITHOUT QUESTION ON THIS IS

01:14:01.637 --> 01:14:02.838
WHERE I WAS GETTING A LITTLE

01:14:02.905 --> 01:14:03.906
BIT INTO THIS CONCEPT OF

01:14:03.972 --> 01:14:06.408
NATCHEZ- WHETHER IT'S POSITIVE

01:14:06.475 --> 01:14:07.976
OR NEGATIVE SO IT COULD BE NOT

01:14:08.043 --> 01:14:10.946
JUST A PENALTIES- SO I AGREE

01:14:11.013 --> 01:14:12.314
TYPICALLY WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO

01:14:12.381 --> 01:14:14.016
CREATE. DEEP IMPACT. IT IS A

01:14:14.082 --> 01:14:15.884
LONG TERM STRATEGY AND

01:14:15.951 --> 01:14:16.852
TYPICALLY NEEDS TO BE AN

01:14:16.919 --> 01:14:18.987
ILLIQUID STRATEGY. SO WHAT YOU

01:14:19.054 --> 01:14:21.957
SEE IS THE IMPACTS FACE BEING

01:14:22.024 --> 01:14:24.827
PREDOMINANTLY. IN THE PRIVATE

01:14:24.893 --> 01:14:26.829
EQUITY OR AND INDEED SOMETIMES

01:14:26.895 --> 01:14:28.931
VENTURE SPACE. AND THOSE BY

01:14:28.997 --> 01:14:30.632
DEFINITION TEND TO BE TENURE

01:14:30.699 --> 01:14:33.836
STRATEGIES- WITHOUT LIQUIDITY-

01:14:33.902 --> 01:14:35.470
SO YOU WANT THAT CAPITAL STAY

01:14:35.537 --> 01:14:36.605
IN THERE TO DRIVE THOSE

01:14:36.672 --> 01:14:37.506
OUTCOMES BUT IT'S NOT

01:14:37.573 --> 01:14:39.875
EXCLUSIVELY THAT. SO DRIVING

01:14:39.942 --> 01:14:41.143
OUTCOMES CAN COME IN DIFFERENT

01:14:41.210 --> 01:14:43.378
WAYS. AND I THINK WHAT WE NEED

01:14:43.445 --> 01:14:45.414
IS AS A BALANCE ACROSS THE

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:47.082
SPECTRUM BACK TO MY PORTFOLIO

01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:48.417
DIVERSIFICATION YOU WOULDN'T

01:14:48.483 --> 01:14:49.852
WANT YOUR ENTIRE PORTFOLIO AS

01:14:49.918 --> 01:14:51.119
AN INVESTOR TO BE FALL INTO

01:14:51.186 --> 01:14:52.454
LIQUID PRIVATE EQUITY

01:14:52.521 --> 01:14:53.522
STRATEGIES AS MUCH AS THEY'RE

01:14:53.589 --> 01:14:55.057
NEEDED. AND THEY CAN GENERATE

01:14:55.123 --> 01:14:57.025
THOSE LONG TERM IMPORT RETURNS

01:14:57.092 --> 01:14:58.427
BUT WHAT CAN YOU DO AS

01:14:58.493 --> 01:15:01.196
POLICYMAKERS. I THINK YOU CAN

01:15:01.263 --> 01:15:02.931
THREE TAX YOU CAN INCENTIVIZE.

01:15:02.998 --> 01:15:04.867
LONG TERM HOLDS AND WE'VE DONE

01:15:04.933 --> 01:15:06.168
THAT ALREADY IN THE PRIVATE

01:15:06.235 --> 01:15:07.469
EQUITY INDUSTRY ALTHOUGH THAT

01:15:07.536 --> 01:15:08.704
MAY CHANGE. BUT WITH THINGS

01:15:08.770 --> 01:15:09.905
LIKE YOU KNOW HOW YOU TAX

01:15:09.972 --> 01:15:12.174
CARRIED INTEREST HOW YOU TAX

01:15:12.241 --> 01:15:13.675
PROBABLE THAT GOES INTO P. E.

01:15:13.742 --> 01:15:15.677
R. VENTURE. I THINK THAT'S ONE

01:15:15.744 --> 01:15:17.346
WAY ANOTHER WAY IS TO THINK

01:15:17.412 --> 01:15:19.047
ABOUT WHAT WHAT IS THE CAPITAL

01:15:19.114 --> 01:15:20.382
THAT GETS INVESTED IN THOSE

01:15:20.449 --> 01:15:22.618
ILLIQUID STRATEGIES- ONE OF THE

01:15:22.684 --> 01:15:25.120
NOTIONS THAT I AM. AS ALWAYS-

01:15:25.187 --> 01:15:26.221
SOMEWHAT BOTHERED ME A LITTLE

01:15:26.288 --> 01:15:29.558
BIT. IS THAT- WE- WE EQUATE

01:15:29.625 --> 01:15:32.227
ILLIQUIDITY ALWAYS WITH A LOT

01:15:32.294 --> 01:15:34.830
OF RISK. AND MOST OF OUR POLICY

01:15:34.897 --> 01:15:43.038
MAKING IN FINANCIAL SERVICES-

01:15:43.105 --> 01:15:43.972
DOESN'T ALLOW RETAIL INVESTOR

01:15:44.039 --> 01:15:44.907
THERE'S ALWAYS OFTENTIMES MOM

01:15:44.973 --> 01:15:46.241
AND- IN THE- TO GET A- IN

01:15:46.308 --> 01:15:47.409
PRIVATE. WE JUST THAT SEE YOU

01:15:47.476 --> 01:15:49.411
HAVE BE SET. TO BE THE LIQUID

01:15:49.478 --> 01:15:51.380
IN THE HOT INSTRUMENT. AND YET

01:15:51.446 --> 01:15:53.749
I SAY WE CAN ALLOW A MOM AND

01:15:53.815 --> 01:15:55.284
POP AN INDIVIDUAL INVESTOR TO

01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:57.352
BUY GAMESTOP OR TO BUY A SINGLE

01:15:57.419 --> 01:15:59.621
SHARE WHICH HAS THE POTENTIAL

01:15:59.688 --> 01:16:01.423
TO DO. AS MUCH AS IT CAN GO UP

01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:03.125
YOU CAN GO TO ZERO BUT IF WE

01:16:03.191 --> 01:16:04.927
LOOK OVER THIRTY YEAR HISTORY

01:16:04.993 --> 01:16:06.995
AND WE LOOK AT THE TOP TIER ONE

01:16:07.062 --> 01:16:09.364
PRIVATE EQUITY. FIRMS I CAN'T

01:16:09.431 --> 01:16:11.633
THINK OF A SINGLE STRATEGY. OF

01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:14.303
A PRIVATE EQUITY FUND THAT HAS

01:16:14.369 --> 01:16:16.371
GONE BUST THEY MAY NOT HAVE MET

01:16:16.438 --> 01:16:19.408
THE 30% OR 25% RETURN HURDLES.

01:16:19.474 --> 01:16:21.343
BUT THAT THE NUMBER THAT HAVE

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:23.645
GONE TO ZERO VIRTUALLY NOW SO I

01:16:23.712 --> 01:16:25.280
THINK EVEN IN THINGS LIKE WHAT

01:16:25.347 --> 01:16:26.748
IS APPROPRIATE IN A PENSION

01:16:26.815 --> 01:16:28.417
FUNDS. IF WE CAN CREATE

01:16:28.483 --> 01:16:30.352
INCENTIVES TO HAVE BALANCE

01:16:30.419 --> 01:16:32.754
BETWEEN ILLIQUID STRATEGIES AND

01:16:32.821 --> 01:16:34.890
LIKE WITH. AND THEN WE GIVE THE

01:16:34.957 --> 01:16:36.124
RETAIL INVESTOR THAT

01:16:36.191 --> 01:16:38.894
OPPORTUNITY TO HELP US DRIVERS

01:16:38.961 --> 01:16:41.063
LONG TERM OUTCOMES WHILE.

01:16:41.129 --> 01:16:43.365
GIVING THEM AN APPROPRIATE RISK

01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:46.435
ADJUSTED RETURN ACCESS TO THOSE

01:16:46.501 --> 01:16:51.773
WONDERFUL DOUBLE TO. THAT THEY

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:52.441
MY NOT A GET THAT COULD BE PER.

01:16:52.507 --> 01:16:53.041
PLACE FOR TO DRIVE POSITIVE

01:16:53.108 --> 01:16:54.242
OUTCOMES. SO I DID ARE. THINGS

01:16:54.309 --> 01:16:55.711
THAT YOU COULD DO TO DRIVE

01:16:55.777 --> 01:16:56.878
THAT. YOU KNOW THE REVERSE IS

01:16:56.945 --> 01:16:57.813
TRUE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:16:57.879 --> 01:16:59.848
WAS SOME OF THE- NEW TAX POLICY

01:16:59.915 --> 01:17:01.516
THAT MAY COME OUT. OF THE TEN

01:17:01.583 --> 01:17:02.784
SHIRLEY CREATING HUGE

01:17:02.851 --> 01:17:04.486
INCENTIVES FOR PEOPLE TO GO

01:17:04.553 --> 01:17:06.688
INTO ETFS- YES SO THIS SHORT

01:17:06.755 --> 01:17:08.290
TERM. LIQUID TRADED PASSIVE

01:17:08.357 --> 01:17:10.525
INSTRUMENTS SO YOU CAN SEE HOW

01:17:10.592 --> 01:17:12.461
VERY QUICKLY PROBABLY SEE ALL

01:17:12.527 --> 01:17:13.495
OF THAT TO BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT

01:17:13.562 --> 01:17:15.030
QUITE ACTIVELY IN THE LAST

01:17:15.097 --> 01:17:16.064
SEVERAL WEEKS WITH SOME OF THE

01:17:16.131 --> 01:17:17.632
NEW POLICY. REGULATION AND

01:17:17.699 --> 01:17:25.907
MAYBE COMING OUT ON TAX- IN- IN

01:17:25.974 --> 01:17:26.508
THE BY THE MINISTRATION. VERY

01:17:26.575 --> 01:17:28.076
VERY QUICKLY CAP THROW WILL. IF

01:17:28.143 --> 01:17:29.478
YOU PROVIDE DIFFERENCE. SO

01:17:29.544 --> 01:17:30.345
THERE'S A TO DO IT WITH TAX

01:17:30.412 --> 01:17:33.048
AWAY THINK ABOUT IT IN. IN

01:17:33.115 --> 01:17:35.117
FUNDS OR OTHER FUNDING. THERE'S

01:17:35.183 --> 01:17:35.984
ANOTHER WAY YOU COULD DO IT-

01:17:36.051 --> 01:17:37.986
INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE

01:17:38.053 --> 01:17:39.788
DESPERATE TO MATCH FUND LONG

01:17:39.855 --> 01:17:40.655
TERM ASSETS AND LONG TERM

01:17:40.722 --> 01:17:42.657
LIABILITIES. IF YOU WENT TO THE

01:17:42.724 --> 01:17:44.126
INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND SAID LET

01:17:44.192 --> 01:17:45.427
ME GIVE YOU SOME POSITIVE

01:17:45.494 --> 01:17:47.529
INCENTIVES SOMEHOW FOR

01:17:47.596 --> 01:17:49.731
PROMOTING YOU TO DO MORE OF

01:17:49.798 --> 01:17:51.066
THIS TYPE OF IMPACT INVESTING

01:17:51.133 --> 01:17:52.701
IS FULLY ALIGNED PARTICULARLY

01:17:52.768 --> 01:17:54.770
ON CLIMATE. WITH THE INSURANCE

01:17:54.836 --> 01:18:00.375
INDUSTRY'S. SUSTAINABLE HEALTH.

01:18:00.442 --> 01:18:00.976
RIGHT BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT

01:18:01.043 --> 01:18:01.543
TO HAVE. UNDER OF BILL OF

01:18:01.610 --> 01:18:02.110
DOLLARS OF PAYOUTS CLIMATE

01:18:02.177 --> 01:18:04.046
RELATED WEATHER EVENTS AND WE

01:18:04.112 --> 01:18:05.747
WOULD LIKE THEM TO TAKE THAT NO

01:18:05.814 --> 01:18:07.849
THOSE THOSE- PREMIUM MONIES AND

01:18:07.916 --> 01:18:09.017
INVEST THEM RIGHT BEHIND THE

01:18:09.084 --> 01:18:10.185
VERY STRATEGIES THAT WILL

01:18:10.252 --> 01:18:11.486
ACTUALLY BE IN THAT WIN WIN

01:18:11.553 --> 01:18:13.355
FROM THEIR OWN BUSINESS MODEL.

01:18:13.422 --> 01:18:15.791
AND MAKING SURE THAT- THAT- YOU

01:18:15.857 --> 01:18:17.726
KNOW- ITS PAYOUTS TO BE LESS

01:18:17.793 --> 01:18:18.427
BECAUSE WE'RE SOLVING THE

01:18:18.493 --> 01:18:20.829
CLIMATE PROBLEM. SO I DO THINK

01:18:20.896 --> 01:18:22.364
THIS REQUIRES SOME DEEP THOUGHT

01:18:22.431 --> 01:18:23.799
BUT I THINK THE OPPORTUNITIES

01:18:23.865 --> 01:18:25.667
ARE THERE FOR US TO RETHINK-

01:18:25.734 --> 01:18:26.501
SHORT TERM VERSUS LONG TERM

01:18:26.568 --> 01:18:28.637
INCENTIVES. IF YOU COULD HAVE A

01:18:28.703 --> 01:18:30.539
QUICK FOLLOW UP YEAH I JUST ONE

01:18:30.605 --> 01:18:31.907
QUICK QUESTION ON YOU KNOW WHAT

01:18:31.973 --> 01:18:33.508
WHAT ABOUT DIRECT INVESTMENT

01:18:33.575 --> 01:18:34.743
FROM THE GOVERNMENT I MEAN. NOT

01:18:34.810 --> 01:18:36.144
IN IT REALLY IN THE RISKIER

01:18:36.211 --> 01:18:37.412
STUFF WHICH YOU KNOW

01:18:37.479 --> 01:18:39.648
HISTORICALLY. WE'VE BEEN LOATH

01:18:39.714 --> 01:18:40.449
AT THE GOVERNMENT INVEST IN

01:18:40.515 --> 01:18:42.451
EQUITY. YOU SEE A ROLE FOR

01:18:42.517 --> 01:18:43.485
DIRECT INVESTMENT FROM THE

01:18:43.552 --> 01:18:44.653
PUBLIC SECTOR IS A SHOULD THAT

01:18:44.719 --> 01:18:46.755
SOLELY PRIVATE. CAPITAL IF WE

01:18:46.822 --> 01:18:48.390
LOOK AT THE GREEN NEW DEAL

01:18:48.457 --> 01:18:50.792
PERFECT EXAMPLE IN THE EO- I

01:18:50.859 --> 01:18:51.893
KNOW I SAID IN LONDON SO I'M

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:53.028
VERY CLOSE TO A LOT OF THE

01:18:53.095 --> 01:18:54.362
EUROPEAN WORKS I DON'T MEAN

01:18:54.429 --> 01:18:55.664
THAT THEY ARE THE ALL AND ALL

01:18:55.730 --> 01:18:57.165
THAT. BUT I THINK IT'S VERY

01:18:57.232 --> 01:18:58.333
PROVOCATIVE PART OF THE GREEN

01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:01.069
NEW DEAL IS INCENTIVIZING

01:19:01.136 --> 01:19:04.639
ACTUAL CAPITAL INVESTMENTS- IN

01:19:04.706 --> 01:19:06.975
THE CITY'S GREEN OR AND ALSO

01:19:07.042 --> 01:19:09.344
SOCIAL. OUTCOMES THAT THEY ARE

01:19:09.411 --> 01:19:10.812
REALLY DRIVING IS VERY HEAVILY

01:19:10.879 --> 01:19:12.314
FOCUSED ON ON GREEN BUT SIDE

01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:13.548
COUPLE JUST TRANSITION SO

01:19:13.615 --> 01:19:14.649
THEY'RE NOT FORGETTING THE

01:19:14.716 --> 01:19:16.151
SOCIAL ASPECT OF IT AS WELL.

01:19:16.218 --> 01:19:18.153
BUT NONE OF THE TRILLION EUROS

01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:20.122
THAT WILL BE INVESTED IN THE

01:19:20.188 --> 01:19:20.722
GREEN DEAL WHICH IS PROMOTED

01:19:20.789 --> 01:19:22.591
BY. ESSENTIALLY AN

01:19:22.657 --> 01:19:24.860
INTERGOVERNMENTAL BODY- IS

01:19:24.926 --> 01:19:26.761
THERE BASICALLY THAT HAVE KEPT

01:19:26.828 --> 01:19:28.997
US SEVEN TO EIGHT SECTORS THAT

01:19:29.064 --> 01:19:34.970
THEY THINK ARE CRITICAL. TO

01:19:35.036 --> 01:19:35.670
MITIGATE CLIMATE CHANGE AND

01:19:35.737 --> 01:19:37.305
BEING VERY FIRST. OF BACKDOOR

01:19:37.372 --> 01:19:38.874
JEFF. OF WHAT WOULD BE AND- IN.

01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:39.474
BUT OF COURSE OF THAT WILL BE

01:19:39.541 --> 01:19:42.244
IN IN FACT. IN VENTURE. BECAUSE

01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:43.778
WE KNOW THAT WE'RE GONNA SOLVE

01:19:43.845 --> 01:19:46.515
CLIMATE CHANGE- THE SCIENCES

01:19:46.581 --> 01:19:48.683
AND ACADEMIC ACADEMIA WILL TELL

01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:50.552
US. ABOUT A THIRD OF WHAT'S

01:19:50.619 --> 01:19:51.486
GOING TO BE REQUIRED OUT OF THE

01:19:51.553 --> 01:19:53.488
TRILLIONS OF INVESTMENT. IS

01:19:53.555 --> 01:19:54.756
GOING TO NEED TO BE IN WHAT I

01:19:54.823 --> 01:19:56.491
CALL THE TRANSITION. AND

01:19:56.558 --> 01:19:57.626
PROCESS IMPROVEMENT SO THAT'S A

01:19:57.692 --> 01:19:59.961
VERY SIMPLE TWEAKING. BUT A

01:20:00.028 --> 01:20:01.163
THIRD OF IT IS GOING TO NEED TO

01:20:01.229 --> 01:20:02.063
COME FROM TECHNOLOGICAL

01:20:02.130 --> 01:20:04.065
INNOVATION SO IT'S GOING TO BE

01:20:04.132 --> 01:20:05.800
ADVANCES IN CARBON CAPTURE AND

01:20:05.867 --> 01:20:07.636
REEN HYDROGEN ALL OF THIS.

01:20:07.702 --> 01:20:09.337
THOSE ARE GOING TO BE IN MY

01:20:09.404 --> 01:20:11.540
OPINION LONG TERM YOU KNOW

01:20:11.606 --> 01:20:13.175
BERMAN S. VALUE CREATION

01:20:13.241 --> 01:20:14.743
OPPORTUNITIES. THANK YOU AND

01:20:14.809 --> 01:20:15.810
HAVE A BALANCED APPROACH A

01:20:15.877 --> 01:20:17.612
PORTFOLIOAPPROACH BUT IF THE

01:20:17.679 --> 01:20:19.381
GOVERNMENT CAN PROVIDE EITHER

01:20:19.447 --> 01:20:21.082
INCENTIVES FOR THOSE INDUSTRIES

01:20:21.149 --> 01:20:22.651
THAT THRIVE IT COULD BE TAX

01:20:22.717 --> 01:20:23.752
INCENTIVES AND THAT'S ANOTHER

01:20:23.818 --> 01:20:25.220
WAY FOR YOU TO INVEST. OR

01:20:25.287 --> 01:20:27.322
ACTUAL DIRECT INVESTMENTS MY

01:20:27.389 --> 01:20:28.657
BELIEF IS THE RETURN ON THOSE

01:20:28.723 --> 01:20:30.192
INVESTMENTS COULD BE ENORMOUS

01:20:30.258 --> 01:20:31.826
FOR THE GOVERNMENT. BECAUSE IT

01:20:31.893 --> 01:20:33.495
ALMOST BY DEFINITION I GUESS

01:20:33.562 --> 01:20:35.130
THE WAY I LOOK AT IT IS. IF

01:20:35.197 --> 01:20:37.065
YOU'RE SOLVING INTRACTABLE

01:20:37.132 --> 01:20:40.135
PROBLEMS. FIND ASSESS CITY-

01:20:40.202 --> 01:20:41.303

01:20:41.369 --> 01:20:45.807
INDUSTRIES. IN THIS BUSINESSES

01:20:45.874 --> 01:20:46.641
WHICH CRACKED THAT. CODES SO TO

01:20:46.708 --> 01:20:47.542
SPEAK WE'RE GOING TO CREATE

01:20:47.609 --> 01:20:48.476
THAT IN IT OF THEM. ARE BE

VEHICLES AND- NO TURNING TO

01:20:56.651 --> 01:20:57.652
FOOD AND ALL THESE OTHER

01:20:57.719 --> 01:20:59.721

STATE PENSION FUND IN THERE

01:21:02.023 --> 01:21:03.692
BUT- I THINK IT REASONABLE.

01:21:03.758 --> 01:21:05.660
PORTION ALLOCATION INTO THIS

01:21:05.727 --> 01:21:09.631
SPACE I WOULD GENERATE GREAT

THE ARTICLE THAT WAS INCLUDED

IN OUR PACKAGE FOR THIS HEARING

01:22:03.551 --> 01:22:06.454
ON THE WARNING THAT

01:22:06.521 --> 01:22:08.456
CORPORATIONS ARE GETTING ABOUT

01:22:08.523 --> 01:22:11.059
CREDIT RISK RIGHT FOR CAPITAL

01:22:11.126 --> 01:22:13.895
FOR CARBON INTENSIVE ACTIVITIES

01:22:13.962 --> 01:22:14.562
RIGHT AND I KNOW THAT'S BEEN A

01:22:14.629 --> 01:22:17.165
HOT TOPIC- RECENTLY I KNOW

01:22:17.232 --> 01:22:19.901
THERE'S A- FEDERAL PROPOSAL

01:22:19.968 --> 01:22:23.171
RIGHT TO- REQUIRE CORPORATIONS

01:22:23.238 --> 01:22:26.708
I THINK TO REALLY- DISCLOSE. AT

01:22:26.775 --> 01:22:27.709
LIKE SOME TYPE OF RISK

01:22:27.776 --> 01:22:29.911
ASSESSMENT RIGHT THAT THE

01:22:29.978 --> 01:22:32.047
EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND

01:22:32.113 --> 01:22:34.449
HERE IN OUR STATE- SOME OF MY

01:22:34.516 --> 01:22:37.018
COLLEAGUES ALSO RIGHT NOW THERE

01:22:37.085 --> 01:22:38.787
SOBRE PROPOSAL'S GOING THROUGH

01:22:38.853 --> 01:22:41.790
THE LEGISLATURE. BOB AND SO MY

01:22:41.856 --> 01:22:43.958
QUESTION YOU KNOW THERE WAS

01:22:44.025 --> 01:22:45.827
SOMETHING IN THIS ARTICLE THAT

01:22:45.894 --> 01:22:46.928
SAYS THAT JUST THE MERE FACT

01:22:46.995 --> 01:22:48.730
THAT THESE FINANCIAL

01:22:48.797 --> 01:22:50.098
INSTITUTIONS ARE LEARNING

01:22:50.165 --> 01:22:52.367
COMPANIES. THAT THERE IS A

01:22:52.434 --> 01:22:55.503
CREDIT RISK- IS THAT IT IS

01:22:55.570 --> 01:22:57.439
HAVING IMPACT AND SO I'M

01:22:57.505 --> 01:22:59.040
CURIOUS LIKE WHAT IMPACT IS

01:22:59.107 --> 01:23:00.508
THAT ALREADY HAVE ENOUGH YOU

01:23:00.575 --> 01:23:03.778
KNOW AND AS A STATE GOVERNMENT.

01:23:03.845 --> 01:23:07.315
WHAT CAN WE DO- TO ENCOURAGE

01:23:07.382 --> 01:23:10.285
THAT IN CALIFORNIA- I KNOW

01:23:10.352 --> 01:23:13.388
THAT. I HAVE SOME ISSUES WITH

01:23:13.455 --> 01:23:15.290
OUR ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATORS

01:23:15.357 --> 01:23:18.626
BEING INVOLVED IN THIS- VERSUS

01:23:18.693 --> 01:23:20.462
A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION BUT

01:23:20.528 --> 01:23:21.863
IT'S KIND OF A MIX OF SINCE

01:23:21.930 --> 01:23:23.531
WE'RE TALK ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE

01:23:23.598 --> 01:23:25.867
AND FINANCIAL RISK OR CREDIT

01:23:25.934 --> 01:23:27.936
RISK IT'S KIND OF A MIX OF TWO

01:23:28.002 --> 01:23:30.004
AND I JUST DON'T KNOW. WHO IS

01:23:30.071 --> 01:23:31.740
THE MOST QUALIFIED WITHIN OUR

01:23:31.806 --> 01:23:34.409
OUR GOVERNMENT TO DO THAT SO

01:23:34.476 --> 01:23:36.311
JUST YOUR THOUGHTS ON ANY OF

01:23:36.378 --> 01:23:38.947
THAT HELPFUL OKAY- OKAY I'LL

01:23:39.013 --> 01:23:43.551
TRY TO OF COURSE THE FIRST.

01:23:43.618 --> 01:23:44.152
THAT UP A LITTLE BIT INTO YOUR

01:23:44.219 --> 01:23:45.620
QUESTION IS I CAN- MAYBE GIVE

01:23:45.687 --> 01:23:48.022
YOU AN OF OUR OWN INSTITUTE. SO

01:23:48.089 --> 01:23:49.624
JUST AS YOU WERE SAYING THIS

01:23:49.691 --> 01:23:51.793
THIS REQUIREMENTS INCREASINGLY

01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:53.495
WHICH IS TODAY- VOLUNTARY BUT

01:23:53.561 --> 01:23:55.096
WILL BECOME MANDATORY BUT THE

01:23:55.163 --> 01:23:56.865
REQUIREMENT EVEN WITH THE E.

01:23:56.931 --> 01:23:58.833
YOU. TO TAKE A TO SHOW THAT

01:23:58.900 --> 01:23:59.701
WE'VE TAKEN THIS INTO

01:23:59.768 --> 01:24:01.636
CONSIDERATION YES AND SHE AND

01:24:01.703 --> 01:24:04.472
THEN IN FACT THIS TASTY F. T.

01:24:04.539 --> 01:24:06.341
WHICH HAS FORCED US TO TAKE A

01:24:06.408 --> 01:24:07.876
LOOK AT OUR EXPOSURES ARE

01:24:07.942 --> 01:24:09.944
LENDING EXPOSURES AS A BANK TO

01:24:10.011 --> 01:24:12.013
GREEN AND BROWN INDUSTRIES. AND

01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:15.016
THEN RUN SCENARIOS UNDER SAY A

01:24:15.083 --> 01:24:16.718
ONE AND A HALF OR TWO OR EVEN

01:24:16.785 --> 01:24:19.220
3 DEGREES SCENARIO WHAT DOES

01:24:19.287 --> 01:24:21.222
THAT LENDING BOOK LOOK LIKE HOW

01:24:21.289 --> 01:24:23.425
EXPOSED IS IT TOO SAFE PHYSICAL

01:24:23.491 --> 01:24:25.894
RISK- IF WE'RE HOLDING A BIG

01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:27.962
PORTFOLIO OF SAY COASTAL REAL

01:24:28.029 --> 01:24:30.665
ESTATE- IF WE HAVE A TWO OR

01:24:30.732 --> 01:24:32.667
THREE DEGREES- SCENARIO. AND WE

01:24:32.734 --> 01:24:34.269
HAVE THE SEA LEVEL RISES THAT

01:24:34.335 --> 01:24:36.237
SCIENTISTS ARE PREDICTING HOW

01:24:36.304 --> 01:24:38.373
MUCH OF THAT ASSET THAT WE HAVE

01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:40.175
ON OUR BOOKS IS GOING TO BE

01:24:40.241 --> 01:24:42.444
IMPAIRED. AND THAT'S THE MATH

01:24:42.510 --> 01:24:44.179
THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO RUN IN

01:24:44.245 --> 01:24:46.247
DEMONSTRATE UNDER G. CFT SO THE

01:24:46.314 --> 01:24:48.750
MERE FACT THAT THAT KNOWLEDGE

01:24:48.817 --> 01:24:51.019
WERE PUSH IS MAKING US DO THAT

01:24:51.085 --> 01:24:53.488
WORK. ALL OF A SUDDEN THEN WHAT

01:24:53.555 --> 01:24:55.190
DOES THAT DO THAT IS DRIVING

01:24:55.256 --> 01:24:57.325
THE BEHAVIOR CHANGE IN OUR

01:24:57.392 --> 01:24:59.294
INSTITUTION AS TO THINKING

01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:10.038
ABOUT. WHO WE WANT TO LEAD TO

01:25:10.104 --> 01:25:10.672
OR WHAT HI OF BUSINESSES AND

01:25:10.738 --> 01:25:12.607
WHAT. OF DO WE WANT TO LEARN TO

01:25:12.674 --> 01:25:13.775
SO IT CREDIT SUISSE HAVE CREE

01:25:13.842 --> 01:25:16.010
SOMETHING THAT WE ON C. E.

01:25:16.077 --> 01:25:17.412
DECLINE ENERGY TRENDS.

01:25:17.479 --> 01:25:18.746
FRAMEWORK AND WE WERE DOING IS

01:25:18.813 --> 01:25:20.615
WORSE. GOING EACH OF HIGH MANY

01:25:20.682 --> 01:25:22.083
IN THIS. TOP TO BOTTOM STAR

01:25:22.150 --> 01:25:23.151
WITH OIL AND GAS. AND WORKING

01:25:23.218 --> 01:25:24.752
ON WAY DOWN TO EVERYTHING FROM

01:25:24.819 --> 01:25:26.387
SHIPPING TO AVIATION AND

01:25:26.454 --> 01:25:28.990
WHATEVER. AND WE HAVE MAPPED

01:25:29.057 --> 01:25:30.758
ALL THE CLIENTS THAT WE BANKS

01:25:30.825 --> 01:25:32.927
AGAINST- THERE IS A HIGH CARBON

01:25:32.994 --> 01:25:35.196
INDUSTRIES AND WE'RE MAPPING

01:25:35.263 --> 01:25:38.333
THEM ON A CURVE- RANGING FROM

01:25:38.399 --> 01:25:40.034
COMPANIES TO WEEK WHO ARE

01:25:40.101 --> 01:25:46.107
UNAWARE. AND SIMPLY OUR

01:25:46.174 --> 01:25:46.708
INDICATING THAT THEY WANT TO

01:25:46.774 --> 01:25:48.409
THEIR- OR MIGHT BASS MODEL. ALL

01:25:48.476 --> 01:25:48.943
THE WAY THROUGH PROGRESS

01:25:49.010 --> 01:25:50.011
COMPANIES MAY BE IN THIS

01:25:50.078 --> 01:25:52.046
INDUSTRY WE SEEM REALLY MAKING

01:25:52.113 --> 01:25:54.115
CHANGE TO MIGRATE. TO SAY

01:25:54.182 --> 01:25:57.151
INVEST IN- BUSINESS MODEL

01:25:57.218 --> 01:25:59.354
CHANGE. AND IT WON'T BE A

01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:00.955
SURPRISE TO ANY OF YOU THAT

01:26:01.022 --> 01:26:03.057
WHAT WE'RE DOING IS AT AND SO

01:26:03.124 --> 01:26:04.526
MAPPING THOSE THOSE COMPANIES

01:26:04.592 --> 01:26:07.228
ALONG THAT SPECTRUM- WE SAID TO

01:26:07.295 --> 01:26:08.029
OURSELVES THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:26:08.096 --> 01:26:10.164
ULTIMATELY. HAVE A SUNSET

01:26:10.231 --> 01:26:12.433
PROVISION. ON THE RELATIONSHIPS

01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:14.469
WITH CLIENTS WHO DON'T

01:26:14.536 --> 01:26:16.037
DEMONSTRATE AN AWARENESS TO

01:26:16.104 --> 01:26:17.539
CHANGE AND A DESIRE TO CHANGE

01:26:17.605 --> 01:26:19.340
BECAUSE WE THINK THAT THOSE

01:26:19.407 --> 01:26:20.875
ASSETS ARE THOSE COMPANIES

01:26:20.942 --> 01:26:22.744
THOSE EXPOSURES ALTERNATELY

01:26:22.810 --> 01:26:24.646
BECOME IMPAIRED CREDITS. IN IN

01:26:24.712 --> 01:26:26.681
THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE SO

01:26:26.748 --> 01:26:28.683
BASICALLY THE BEHAVIOR CHANGES

01:26:28.750 --> 01:26:30.418
THAT WE'RE NOW MIGRATING. WHO

01:26:30.485 --> 01:26:32.320
WE WANT TO THANK IN FUTURE AND

01:26:32.387 --> 01:26:33.121
THAT'S THE COMPANIES THAT I

01:26:33.187 --> 01:26:34.656
DON'T WANT TO TRANSITION OR

01:26:34.722 --> 01:26:37.158
THAT ARE ALREADY- IN THAT- THAT

01:26:37.225 --> 01:26:40.328
GREEN SPACE SHALL WE SAY. SO

01:26:40.395 --> 01:26:41.529
THIS IS SORT OF A LONG WINDED

01:26:41.596 --> 01:26:42.630
ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION BUT I

01:26:42.697 --> 01:26:43.798
THINK THAT MAYBE THAT

01:26:43.865 --> 01:26:45.567
ILLUSTRATION GIVES YOU A SENSE

01:26:45.633 --> 01:26:47.936
OF JUST HOW SERIOUS THIS IS. SO

01:26:48.002 --> 01:26:49.604
THAT'S ONE ASPECT OF IT.

01:26:49.671 --> 01:26:50.939
ANOTHER ASPECT OF IT WHEN WE

01:26:51.005 --> 01:26:52.106
TALK ABOUT WHETHER THIS IS THE

01:26:52.173 --> 01:26:54.709
FIRST YOU OF LEGISLATURE OR

01:26:54.776 --> 01:26:56.611
JUST LET MARKET FORCES AT WORK.

01:26:56.678 --> 01:26:58.012
I CAN CERTAINLY TELL YOU THAT

01:26:58.079 --> 01:26:59.881
THE DRUMBEATS OF THE CLIMATE

01:26:59.948 --> 01:27:01.649
ACTIVISTS ARE LOUDER AND

01:27:01.716 --> 01:27:03.651
LOUDER. AND THAT'S MANIFESTING

01:27:03.718 --> 01:27:06.621
ITSELF IN INSTITUTIONAL AND-

01:27:06.688 --> 01:27:07.622
EIGHT. GOING INTO CORPORATES

01:27:07.689 --> 01:27:09.824
AND SAYING IT'S ALL THIS DIVEST

01:27:09.891 --> 01:27:11.826
CAMPAIGN TYPE WORK THAT SAY.

01:27:11.893 --> 01:27:13.861
THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW UNLESS

01:27:13.928 --> 01:27:15.363
YOU'VE DEMONSTRATED THAT YOU'RE

01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:16.798
ON A PATH TO NET ZERO PARIS

01:27:16.864 --> 01:27:18.766
ALIGNMENT WE CAN NO LONGER HOLD

01:27:18.833 --> 01:27:21.035
YOUR STOCK. AND WHEN COALITIONS

01:27:21.102 --> 01:27:22.236
OF INVESTORS GO INTO A

01:27:22.303 --> 01:27:23.571
CORPORATE AND WE'RE TALKING ON

01:27:23.638 --> 01:27:25.773
THE LARGE CAP CORPORATES WE'RE

01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:27.175
SEEING COALITIONS FORM OF.

01:27:27.241 --> 01:27:28.676
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF

01:27:28.743 --> 01:27:30.511
SHAREHOLDER CAPITAL DEMANDED IN

01:27:30.578 --> 01:27:32.180
THE CLOCK COMPANIES RESPOND TO

01:27:32.246 --> 01:27:34.115
THAT OR THEY WILL DIVEST IT'S A

01:27:34.182 --> 01:27:35.984
VERY POWERFUL MOTIVATOR. SO I

01:27:36.050 --> 01:27:37.485
THINK THERE IS AN ELEMENT THAT

01:27:37.552 --> 01:27:38.953
THAT THIS IS ALMOST TAKING CARE

01:27:39.020 --> 01:27:45.360
OF ITSELF. BUT WHERE I. THINK

01:27:45.426 --> 01:27:46.327
POLICY COULD EXCEL THE RATE

01:27:46.394 --> 01:27:48.630
THAT IS WHAT IF HAD- CAPITAL

01:27:48.696 --> 01:27:50.231
GAINS AND- FOR A- IN GREEN. FOR

01:27:50.298 --> 01:27:53.935
CAPITAL HITS IF YOU WILL. FOR

01:27:54.002 --> 01:27:56.404
CONTINUING TO. LAND TO BROWN SO

01:27:56.471 --> 01:27:58.606
FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY IN

01:27:58.673 --> 01:27:59.874
ONE OF OUR BIGGEST ISSUES IS WE

01:27:59.941 --> 01:28:01.909
HAVE TO SET ASIDE CAPITAL OR

01:28:01.976 --> 01:28:03.411
RISK WEIGHTED ASSETS AGAINST

01:28:03.478 --> 01:28:05.380
THE RISKIER ASSETS. WELL IF

01:28:05.446 --> 01:28:06.814
RISK ISN'T BEGINNING TO

01:28:06.881 --> 01:28:09.083
INCREASINGLY BE DEFINED AS-

01:28:09.150 --> 01:28:11.386
CLIMATE RELATED RISKS RIGHT- OR

01:28:11.452 --> 01:28:13.521
THE RISK OF STRANDED ASSETS-

01:28:13.588 --> 01:28:14.622
ALL OF A SUDDEN IT'S GOING TO

01:28:14.689 --> 01:28:16.724
BE VERY VERY EXPENSIVE. FOR US

01:28:16.791 --> 01:28:17.859
TO CONTINUE TO LAND BROWN

01:28:17.925 --> 01:28:19.227
INDUSTRIES WE WON'T DO IT

01:28:19.293 --> 01:28:20.895
ANYMORE. AND THEN THOSE

01:28:20.962 --> 01:28:21.863
COMPANIES WILL BE STARVED OF

01:28:21.929 --> 01:28:24.232
CAPITAL IN WHICH CASE THEY'LL

01:28:24.298 --> 01:28:24.866
EITHER HAVE TO MIGRATE AND

01:28:24.932 --> 01:28:26.567
TRANSITION. OR THEY WON'T

01:28:26.634 --> 01:28:29.137
SURVIVE AND SO I THINK POLICY

01:28:29.203 --> 01:28:31.039
COULD ACTUALLY ACCELERATE THAT

01:28:31.105 --> 01:28:32.807
CHANGE YOU KNOW IF THAT IS

01:28:32.874 --> 01:28:34.075
SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE ON THE

01:28:34.142 --> 01:28:35.510
AGENDA. SO THAT THAT COULD BE A

01:28:35.576 --> 01:28:37.278
VERY POWERFUL TOOL IN

01:28:37.345 --> 01:28:38.980
CONJUNCTION. WITH THE FINANCIAL

01:28:39.047 --> 01:28:40.415
SERVICES INDUSTRY AND YOU DON'T

01:28:40.481 --> 01:28:41.816
HAVE TO BE A CLIMATE SCIENTIST.

01:28:41.883 --> 01:28:43.685
AT TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN YOU KNOW

01:28:43.751 --> 01:28:44.652
I DON'T THINK YOU NEED DEEP

01:28:44.719 --> 01:28:46.688
EXPERTISE IN CLIMATE SCIENTISTS

01:28:46.754 --> 01:28:47.188
YOU CAN SAY WHAT ARE NOT

01:28:47.255 --> 01:28:48.623
JUSTIFIED REALLY SEE

01:28:48.690 --> 01:28:50.925
FUNDAMENTALLY I WANT TO DRIVE.

01:28:50.992 --> 01:28:52.460
GREEN INVESTMENT THEY'RE VERY

01:28:52.527 --> 01:28:54.262
EASY WAYS TO DO THAT WITH WITH

01:28:54.328 --> 01:28:55.830
POLICY ON TOP OF WHAT THE

01:28:55.897 --> 01:28:59.600
ACTUAL SERVICES. WOULD

01:28:59.667 --> 01:29:00.201
OTHERWISE ORDINARY. I DON'T I

01:29:00.268 --> 01:29:01.369
DON'T KNOW BUT ANSWERS YOUR

01:29:01.436 --> 01:29:02.336
QUESTION TO HOLD TOUCHED ALL

01:29:02.403 --> 01:29:05.707
THE- OF. IT IT GETS ME TO TAKE

01:29:05.773 --> 01:29:07.075
TO JUST TO FOLLOW UP THAT WAS

01:29:07.141 --> 01:29:09.043
WHEN YOU SAID POLICY OULD.

01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:11.012
ENCOURAGE WHAT SPECIFIC KIND OF

01:29:11.079 --> 01:29:13.748
POLICY COULD THE STATE OF

01:29:13.815 --> 01:29:14.315
CALIFORNIA DUE TO ENCOURAGE

01:29:14.382 --> 01:29:17.085
THAT. AND I'M I'M NOT EXACTLY

01:29:17.151 --> 01:29:18.119
SURE WHERE I HEAR BETTER SO

01:29:18.186 --> 01:29:19.287
YOU'LL SEE ME MOVING BACK AND

01:29:19.353 --> 01:29:21.355
FORTH AND I'LL JUST ADD ON TO

01:29:21.422 --> 01:29:23.124

NOT. YET RECENTLY RECENTLY AND-

01:29:51.185 --> 01:29:52.854
MOST PARTS OF THE WORLD WHERE

01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:54.155
IT'S CONSIDERED PART OF YOUR

01:30:29.257 --> 01:30:32.059
DO IT. THROUGH SUBTLE NUDGES AS

01:30:32.126 --> 01:30:34.495
I SAY YOU CAN DO IT THREE TAX

01:30:34.562 --> 01:30:36.097
YOU CAN DO IT THROUGH-

01:30:36.164 --> 01:30:38.166
PENALTIES- THAT THAT THERE ARE

01:30:38.232 --> 01:30:39.700
THERE ARE SO MANY TOOLS I THINK

01:30:39.767 --> 01:30:41.269
YOU HAVE AT YOUR DISPOSAL BUT

01:30:41.335 --> 01:30:42.470
THAT'S THE OBVIOUS ONES ARE AS

01:30:42.537 --> 01:30:45.640
I SAY NOT AS OR OR PENALTIES-

01:30:45.706 --> 01:30:49.177
BUT- I. I TEND TO BE A BIG FAN

01:30:49.243 --> 01:30:50.578
OF DRIVING BEHAVIOR CHANGE

01:30:50.645 --> 01:30:52.246
THROUGH INCENTIVES RATHER THAN

01:30:52.313 --> 01:30:54.949
DISINCENTIVES- I FIND

01:30:55.016 --> 01:30:56.217
DISINCENTIVES ALWAYS HAVE SUCH

01:30:56.284 --> 01:30:57.485
A NEGATIVE CONNOTATION THAT I

01:30:57.552 --> 01:30:58.920
THINK ARE VERY UNPOPULAR WITH

01:30:58.986 --> 01:31:00.588
LARGE SWATHS OF THE POPULATION

01:31:00.655 --> 01:31:01.789
BECAUSE IT ALWAYS FEELS LIKE

01:31:01.856 --> 01:31:03.457
YOU'RE GIVING SOMETHING UP.

01:31:03.524 --> 01:31:06.060
ASSEMBLY CAN REDIRECT- MORE

01:31:06.127 --> 01:31:07.361
TOWARDS THE PRESIDENT'S AN

01:31:07.428 --> 01:31:09.163
INSIDE I THINK IT'S IT TENDS TO

01:31:09.230 --> 01:31:11.332
BE BETTER ABLE TO BE DIGESTED

01:31:11.399 --> 01:31:19.440
BY FIRE CONSTITUENCIES. AND I

01:31:19.507 --> 01:31:19.974
THINK YOU HAVE TO TELL THE

01:31:20.041 --> 01:31:21.209
OPPORTUNITY THE STORY- TO. THAT

01:31:21.275 --> 01:31:22.343
IS SO MUCH A PART OF COURSE.

01:31:22.410 --> 01:31:23.044
BECAUSE IN THE GAME WINNERS

01:31:23.110 --> 01:31:24.912
LOSERS. JUST IN THE SHOW OF HI.

01:31:24.979 --> 01:31:26.147
EMITTING INDUSTRIES TO GREENER

01:31:26.214 --> 01:31:28.249
ENERGY THERE WILL BE THOSE WHO

01:31:28.316 --> 01:31:30.318
ARE EMPLOYED IN THE HIGH CARBON

01:31:30.384 --> 01:31:31.619
EMITTING INDUSTRIES THAT COULD

01:31:31.686 --> 01:31:34.388
PERCEIVE THIS. AS A BIG LOSS

01:31:34.455 --> 01:31:35.256
AND SO THEY MAY WANT TO FIGHT

01:31:35.323 --> 01:31:37.158
THAT CHANGE. ON THE OTHER HAND

01:31:37.225 --> 01:31:39.927
IF WE ARE AT THAT- AND SOMEBODY

01:31:39.994 --> 01:31:41.095
REFERENCED AT THE KODAK

01:31:41.162 --> 01:31:43.598
MOMENTS- WHETHER YOU FACE

01:31:43.664 --> 01:31:45.566
DISRUPTION IF YOU DON'T CHANGE.

01:31:45.633 --> 01:31:47.034
WHAT WE WOULD RATHER DO IS

01:31:47.101 --> 01:31:49.337
PREPARE THOSE INDUSTRIES ARE

01:31:49.403 --> 01:31:52.240
ULTIMATELY GOING TO FACE- THE-

01:31:52.306 --> 01:31:54.942
MASSIVE VALUE LOSS. TO TRY TO

01:31:55.009 --> 01:31:56.711
TRANSITION PEOPLE SOONER SO IT

01:31:56.777 --> 01:31:57.812
DOESN'T COME AS A SHOCKER WE

01:31:57.879 --> 01:31:59.380
DON'T HAVE STRANDED ASSETS OR

01:31:59.447 --> 01:32:02.550
WASTED- YOU KNOW- HOPE

01:32:02.617 --> 01:32:03.885
COMMUNITIES. BECAUSE THEY

01:32:03.951 --> 01:32:06.454
HAVEN'T BEEN REALLY PUSH TO TRY

01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:08.789
TO QUICKLY ADAPT TO ME IT'S ALL

01:32:08.856 --> 01:32:09.757
ABOUT THIS THIS CLIMATE

01:32:09.824 --> 01:32:11.759
ADAPTATION CLIMATE ADAPTATION

01:32:11.826 --> 01:32:12.560
IS SEIZING THE MOMENT OF THE

01:32:12.627 --> 01:32:15.630
OPPORTUNITY- SO ANOTHER AREA BY

01:32:15.696 --> 01:32:16.831
THE WAY THAT WE DIDN'T TOUCH ON

01:32:16.898 --> 01:32:17.832
IS I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THE

01:32:17.899 --> 01:32:20.034
STATE. GETS INVOLVED IN ANY

01:32:20.101 --> 01:32:22.203
TYPE OF SUBSIDIES. BUT

01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:23.671
SUBSIDIES ARE A POWERFUL

01:32:23.738 --> 01:32:25.206
INCENTIVE ALSO TO DRIVE CHANGE

01:32:25.273 --> 01:32:26.173
WHO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:28.943
EARLIER ABOUT TAX. BUT YOU KNOW

01:32:29.010 --> 01:32:30.311
IF WE EVEN READ DIRECT

01:32:30.378 --> 01:32:32.079
SUBSIDIES AS THE BY THE STRANGE

01:32:32.146 --> 01:32:34.048
SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT- TOWARDS

01:32:34.115 --> 01:32:35.683
SAY THAT- FOSSIL FUELS

01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:37.919
INDUSTRY. AND PUSH THOSE TOWARD

01:32:37.985 --> 01:32:39.654
GREEN. YOU NEED TO SEE AGAIN

01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:41.322
HOW QUICKLY THE CAPITAL FLOW TO

01:32:41.389 --> 01:32:42.790
THOSE AREAS BECAUSE IT WILL BE

01:32:42.857 --> 01:32:43.824
MORE ATTRACTIVE PLACES TO

01:32:43.891 --> 01:32:46.060
INVEST. AND THE VALUE CREATION

01:32:46.127 --> 01:32:48.229
OPPORTUNITIES THERE AN EQUAL

01:32:48.296 --> 01:32:50.064
DOWNSIDE SIDE IS THAT IF YOU'RE

01:32:50.131 --> 01:32:51.732
CONTINUING TO SAY INVEST IN

01:32:51.799 --> 01:32:52.967
COMPANIES THAT WILL NO LONGER

01:32:53.034 --> 01:32:54.802
BE RECIPIENTS OF SUBSIDIES. ARE

01:32:54.869 --> 01:32:55.803
THOSE BUSINESSES STILL EVEN

01:32:55.870 --> 01:32:58.039
VIABLE WITHOUT SUBSIDY. OR WILL

01:32:58.105 --> 01:32:59.407
THE VALUE LAST BE SO GREAT THAT

01:32:59.473 --> 01:32:59.974
YOU DON'T WANNA HOLD THOSE

01:33:00.041 --> 01:33:01.876
ASSETS SO I THINK THAT AGAIN

01:33:01.943 --> 01:33:03.611
THOSE ARE JUST A FEW SNIPPETS

01:33:03.678 --> 01:33:06.580
OF IDEAS THAT YOU COULD DO- TO-

01:33:06.647 --> 01:33:07.815
TO PROMOTE ALL OF THIS. I THINK

01:33:07.882 --> 01:33:09.083
THE OTHER AREA BY THE WAY WHICH

01:33:09.150 --> 01:33:10.952
DOESN'T EVEN REQUIRE ONE POLICY

01:33:11.018 --> 01:33:13.020
INTERVENTION IS JUST BE VOCAL.

01:33:13.087 --> 01:33:19.727
ABOUT. THE FACT THAT-

01:33:19.794 --> 01:33:20.928
CALIFORNIA ENCOURAGE AGES. A

01:33:20.995 --> 01:33:21.963
SUSTAINABLE. OR IS X. ABOUT

01:33:22.029 --> 01:33:23.331
CREATE CALL SUPPORTING ALL

01:33:23.397 --> 01:33:25.232
INDUSTRIES- THAT. TO WITH US

01:33:25.299 --> 01:33:27.301
USING THE- AROUND. OR SOCIAL.

01:33:27.368 --> 01:33:29.270
SO EVEN SOMETIMES JUST BEING

01:33:29.337 --> 01:33:31.872
VERY CLEAR DIRECTIONALLY. ABOUT

01:33:31.939 --> 01:33:33.040
WHERE THE STATE IS ON THESE

01:33:33.107 --> 01:33:35.443
TOPICS IS VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE

01:33:35.509 --> 01:33:37.044
WHEN INVESTORS GET CONFUSED

01:33:37.111 --> 01:33:39.080
MESSAGES THAN THEY DO WORRY

01:33:39.146 --> 01:33:42.383
ABOUT- POLICY INTERVENTION KIND

01:33:42.450 --> 01:33:44.852
OF- SOMEHOW. CLEAR DURING THEIR

01:33:44.919 --> 01:33:46.454
THEIR INVESTMENT DECISIONS AND

01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:47.555
THAT'S COMING AS A SHOCK TO

01:33:47.621 --> 01:33:49.123
THEM SO THEY WERE BEING VERY

01:33:49.190 --> 01:33:51.892
VERY- CHRIS. AND THE DESIRE TO

01:33:51.959 --> 01:33:53.361
TRY TO PUSH IN A GIVEN

01:33:53.427 --> 01:33:53.961
DIRECTION THE EXTENT THAT YOU

01:33:54.028 --> 01:33:56.897
POSSIBLY CAN- IS ANOTHER WAY TO

01:33:56.964 --> 01:33:59.433
GIVE CONFIDENCE TO THE MARKETS

01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:01.235
TO INVEST BEHIND THEM. ANYTHING

01:34:01.302 --> 01:34:02.703
ELSE LOOSE THANK YOU SENATOR

01:34:02.770 --> 01:34:05.773
ALAN. WHAT WELL FIRST OFF THANK

01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:07.675
YOU TO THE CHAIRS FOR PUTTING

01:34:07.742 --> 01:34:09.677
TOGETHER A REALLY FASCINATING

01:34:09.744 --> 01:34:11.612
DISCUSSION THANK YOU MISTER-

01:34:11.679 --> 01:34:13.681
APPRECIATE ALL YOUR- KNOWLEDGE

01:34:13.748 --> 01:34:15.883
AND- INTERPRETERS AVACEN HERE

01:34:15.950 --> 01:34:17.685
TODAY. YEAH I GOT SO MANY

01:34:17.752 --> 01:34:20.554
QUESTIONS I AM. YOU'RE THE

01:34:20.621 --> 01:34:21.789
STATE CALIFORNIA WE DID PASS A

01:34:21.856 --> 01:34:24.125
BILL THAT- NASSER CAL STIRS

01:34:24.191 --> 01:34:27.428
CALPERS TO LOOK IT. AT AT AT AT

01:34:27.495 --> 01:34:30.031
RISK AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT IS

01:34:30.097 --> 01:34:31.232
THERE CLIMATE RELATED RISK

01:34:31.298 --> 01:34:33.467
BECAUSE THEY'RE MAKING THEIR-INVESTMENT DECISIONS AND HE'S

01:34:33.534 --> 01:34:35.269
BEEN A BIT OF IT. BACK AND

01:34:35.336 --> 01:34:38.272
FORTH- OVER THERE AND- THAT

01:34:38.339 --> 01:34:40.241
THAT THAT THERE'S SOME TENSIONS

01:34:40.307 --> 01:34:42.143
INTERESTINGLY- BETWEEN THEIR

01:34:42.209 --> 01:34:43.511
BOARD AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

01:34:43.577 --> 01:34:45.980
THE BILL. BUT I'M- YOU KNOW I'M

01:34:46.047 --> 01:34:47.248
<u>&lt;c.red&gt;'M I LIKE TO ASK A COUPLE&lt;/c&gt;</u>

01:34:47.314 --> 01:34:48.916
THINGS FIRST OF ALL DELIVER

01:34:48.983 --> 01:34:49.683
THOUGHTS ON THE WHOLE DIVEST

01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:52.386
MEANT DEBATE- I'M IN THE BACK

01:34:52.453 --> 01:34:57.324
AND FORTH- YOU KNOW ON THAT-

01:34:57.391 --> 01:34:58.926
THE EXTENT TO WHICH- YOU KNOW

01:34:58.993 --> 01:35:00.094
IF YOU DIVEST YOU'RE- YOU'RE

01:35:00.161 --> 01:35:01.495
PULLING YOURSELF. OBVIOUSLY YOU

01:35:01.562 --> 01:35:02.963
YOU YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE YOUR

01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:05.699
MONEY GOING INTO. IMAGINED AND

01:35:05.766 --> 01:35:06.967
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY DAMAGING

01:35:07.034 --> 01:35:08.569
ACTIVITY AT THE SAME TIME WHEN

01:35:08.636 --> 01:35:10.604
YOU WHEN YOU DIVEST. ONE OF THE

01:35:10.671 --> 01:35:11.505
ARGUMENTS AS YOU PULL YOURSELF

01:35:11.572 --> 01:35:13.140
OUT OF THE CONVERSATION ABOUT.

01:35:13.207 --> 01:35:14.875
TRANSITIONING THESE COMPANIES

01:35:14.942 --> 01:35:17.111
TOWARD A MORE SUSTAINABLE MODEL-

01:35:17.178 --> 01:35:18.279
SO LET LET LET'S START WITH

01:35:18.345 --> 01:35:20.147
THAT LOVE TO HEAR YOUR

01:35:20.214 --> 01:35:20.681
CONVERSATION YOU'RE YOU'RE

01:35:20.748 --> 01:35:22.950
THOUGHT. OF US IN THE SHORT. SO

01:35:23.017 --> 01:35:24.218
I'M SPEAKING AS AN INDIVIDUAL

01:35:24.285 --> 01:35:24.952
BUT I ALSO THINK

01:35:25.019 --> 01:35:26.887
PHILOSOPHICALLY I. DO

01:35:26.954 --> 01:35:29.356
REPRESENT- OUR OUR BELIEF IT AT

01:35:29.423 --> 01:35:32.526
CREDIT SUISSE AS WELL IS THAT-

01:35:32.593 --> 01:35:34.795
THE VESTMENT HAS A CERTAIN

01:35:34.862 --> 01:35:36.931
PLACE. IN ALL OF THIS BUT

01:35:36.997 --> 01:35:38.732
FRANKLY I THINK THE MORE

01:35:38.799 --> 01:35:40.701
IMPORTANT TOOL THAT WE THINK OF

01:35:40.768 --> 01:35:42.870
AS AS A BANK IS WE WOULD MUCH

01:35:42.937 --> 01:35:44.772
RATHER FINANCE THE TRANSITION.

01:35:44.839 --> 01:35:46.273
WE THINK THAT WE ARE NOT GOING

01:35:46.340 --> 01:35:47.575
TO GET TO NEXT YEAR WE'RE NOT

01:35:47.641 --> 01:35:49.243
GONNA BE ABLE TO KEEP WITHIN-

01:35:49.310 --> 01:35:51.545
PARIS GOALS IF WE DON'T GET THE

01:35:51.612 --> 01:35:52.880
HIGH CARBON EMITTING INDUSTRIES

01:35:52.947 --> 01:35:54.815
TO MOVE. AND THAT IS NOT

01:35:54.882 --> 01:35:55.282
SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS

01:35:55.349 --> 01:35:56.784
OVERNIGHT TO THE QUESTION OF

01:35:56.851 --> 01:35:57.551
THIS IS A LONGER TERM

01:35:57.618 --> 01:35:59.553
INVESTMENT- VERSES OR SOMETHING

01:35:59.620 --> 01:36:00.521
THAT CAN BE DONE IN THE SHORT

01:36:00.588 --> 01:36:02.990
TERM. BUT WE DO NEED TO BE A

01:36:03.057 --> 01:36:05.659
PART OF FINANCING THAT SO I

01:36:05.726 --> 01:36:08.095
THINK WHAT I SAY AS WE KNOW

01:36:08.162 --> 01:36:10.297
TODAY THE WORLD WAS RELIANT ON

01:36:10.364 --> 01:36:11.832
FOSSIL FUELS WE SAID WE'RE

01:36:11.899 --> 01:36:13.100
GOING TO DIVEST AND JUST CUT IT

01:36:13.167 --> 01:36:15.503
OFF TOMORROW. WE WOULD CUT OFF

01:36:15.569 --> 01:36:16.837
EVERYBODY FROM THE PRIMARY

01:36:16.904 --> 01:36:18.572
SOURCE OF HEAT AND ELECTRICITY

01:36:18.639 --> 01:36:20.774
AND ENERGY AND WE WOULD ALSO

01:36:20.841 --> 01:36:23.277
CREATE A HIGHLY UNJUST OUTCOME

01:36:23.344 --> 01:36:24.512
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THESE

01:36:24.578 --> 01:36:25.579
TYPES OF ACTIONS

01:36:25.646 --> 01:36:26.981
DISPROPORTIONATELY ALWAYS

01:36:27.047 --> 01:36:28.883
AFFECT THOSE AT THE LOWER

01:36:28.949 --> 01:36:30.484
ECONOMIC STRATA. BECAUSE THEY

01:36:30.551 --> 01:36:31.385
TYPICALLY DON'T HAVE

01:36:31.452 --> 01:36:33.454
ALTERNATIVES SO WE CAN'T DO

01:36:33.521 --> 01:36:34.822
THAT WE'VE WE'VE GOT TO DO THIS

01:36:34.889 --> 01:36:36.490
IN A IN A THOUGHTFUL AND

01:36:36.557 --> 01:36:42.563
STANDS- MASATAKA WAY. SO WHAT I

01:36:42.630 --> 01:36:45.900
WOULD. BUT SAY. IS IF WE DO.

01:36:45.966 --> 01:36:50.237
HAVE H. GREEN. ALTERNATIVE

01:36:50.304 --> 01:36:51.805
RIGHT A OPPORTUNITY AT PATHWAY

01:36:51.872 --> 01:36:53.674
THAT'S TRULY GREED THERE I

01:36:53.741 --> 01:36:55.509
THINK WE REALLY NEED TO DRIVE

01:36:55.576 --> 01:36:57.344
WITH AS MUCH CARE AS THE STACK

01:36:57.411 --> 01:36:58.979
BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE A SOLUTION

01:36:59.046 --> 01:37:00.848
THAT IS TRULY VIABLE WE GOT TO

01:37:00.915 --> 01:37:02.349
MOVE TO THAT WE HAVE TO MOVE

01:37:02.416 --> 01:37:04.351
FAST THERE'S AN URGENCY HERE.

01:37:04.418 --> 01:37:07.655
BUT IN AREAS WHERE- YOU HAVE A

01:37:07.721 --> 01:37:09.690
VAST MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION

01:37:09.757 --> 01:37:11.625
THAT IS RELIANCE ON THAT SOURCE

01:37:11.692 --> 01:37:13.394
OF ENERGY AS AN EXAMPLE THEN

01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:14.428
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BRING

01:37:14.495 --> 01:37:16.263
PEOPLE ALONG THE JOURNEY AND

01:37:16.330 --> 01:37:17.798
THAT'S NOT ONLY JUST IN TERMS

01:37:17.865 --> 01:37:18.666
OF THE COMPANY'S MINORING IN

01:37:18.732 --> 01:37:20.034
BUSINESS PLANS IN OUR OWN RIGHT

01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:21.068
BUT IT'S ALSO MAKING SURE WE

01:37:21.135 --> 01:37:22.903
DON'T LEAVE PEOPLE BEHIND SO

01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:24.638
IT'S A COMBINATION OF BOTH BUT

01:37:24.705 --> 01:37:26.073
YOU'RE IS LIKE COAL WHICH

01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:29.343
GENUINELY TODAY- DO NOT HAVE A

01:37:29.410 --> 01:37:30.511
PLACE IN OUR SOCIETY THEY'RE SO

01:37:30.578 --> 01:37:32.213
DESTRUCTIVE YOU HAVE BETTER

01:37:32.279 --> 01:37:34.048
CHEAPER ALTERNATIVES. WE REALLY

01:37:34.114 --> 01:37:36.150
OUT OF PUSH FOR NO MORE BUT

01:37:36.217 --> 01:37:37.618
PLACES LIKE FOSSIL FUELS WE'RE

01:37:37.685 --> 01:37:38.852
GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE THIS

01:37:38.919 --> 01:37:40.054
MIGRATION BUT WE NEED TO

01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:41.422
ACCELERATE THE TRANSITION WE'D

01:37:41.488 --> 01:37:43.357
RATHER DO IS FUN WITH THESE

01:37:43.424 --> 01:37:45.859
COMPANIES INTO BOTH INVESTING

01:37:45.926 --> 01:37:47.995
IN THEIR BUSINESS BY MIGRATION

01:37:48.062 --> 01:37:49.196
BUT ALSO INVESTING IN THE

01:37:49.263 --> 01:37:50.564
TECHNOLOGIES IT'LL PROVIDE

01:37:50.631 --> 01:37:52.399
PATHWAYS SOMETIMES TODAY DON'T

01:37:52.466 --> 01:37:54.168
EVEN EXIST YOU KNOW THERE ARE

01:37:54.235 --> 01:37:55.436
MANY INDUSTRIES AND HIGH CARBON

01:37:55.502 --> 01:37:57.705
IN SPACE WHERE YOU ACTUALLY

01:37:57.771 --> 01:37:58.339
DON'T HAVE TO AGREE AN

01:37:58.405 --> 01:38:00.040
ALTERNATE YEAH. WE DON'T HAVE A

01:38:00.107 --> 01:38:01.575
TRULY GREEN ALTERNATIVE FOR

01:38:01.642 --> 01:38:02.810
AVIATION FUEL TODAY ALTHOUGH

01:38:02.876 --> 01:38:03.644
THERE ARE SOME PROMISING

01:38:03.711 --> 01:38:05.512
TECHNOLOGIES IN THE WORKS SO

01:38:05.579 --> 01:38:07.114
IT'S A COMBINATION OF BOTH IS

01:38:07.181 --> 01:38:09.216
MY ULTIMATE ANSWER BUT I DON'T

01:38:09.283 --> 01:38:10.851
THINK THAT DIVESTMENT ALONE IS

01:38:10.918 --> 01:38:11.785
GOING TO CHEAT THE OUTCOMES

01:38:11.852 --> 01:38:12.987
THAT WE WANT TO GET COULD BE

01:38:13.053 --> 01:38:15.189
CATASTROPHICALLY DETRIMENTAL TO

01:38:15.256 --> 01:38:16.523
SOCIETY IN THE MEANTIME IF WE

01:38:16.590 --> 01:38:22.696
ALL SET. TURN OFF THE TAPS

01:38:22.763 --> 01:38:23.864
TOMORROW. WELL THE PROBLEM IT

01:38:23.931 --> 01:38:25.332
THE- NEED SOME RESPECTS. OF

01:38:25.399 --> 01:38:26.433
COURSE IF YOU HAVE. WERE TO OFF

01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:27.534
THE TOP TOMORROW. BUT THE TRUTH

01:38:27.601 --> 01:38:29.637
AS WE ALL KNOW. IS ONE. OF THE-

01:38:29.703 --> 01:38:31.305
CAPITAL MARKETS THAT WOULD TURN

01:38:31.372 --> 01:38:32.473
OFF THE TAPS AND IN FACT YOU

01:38:32.539 --> 01:38:34.108
HAVE A ONE YOU HAVE OTHER.

01:38:34.174 --> 01:38:37.177
PORTIONS OF. INVESTOR COMMUNITY

01:38:37.244 --> 01:38:38.279
THAT MAKE A LOT OF MONEY OFF OF

01:38:38.345 --> 01:38:39.680
THE FACT THAT. SO MANY PEOPLE

01:38:39.747 --> 01:38:40.648
ARE PULLING OUT AND YET THERE

01:38:40.714 --> 01:38:44.018
IS THIS THIS RELIANCE IN THE

01:38:44.084 --> 01:38:44.618
COURSE OF THE FOLKS ARE MAKING

01:38:44.685 --> 01:38:47.254
MONEY OFTENTIMES- YOU KNOW THE

01:38:47.321 --> 01:38:48.856
BILL THE LEAST- SOCIALLY

01:38:48.922 --> 01:38:50.324
INCLINED- YOU KNOW BECAUSE

01:38:50.391 --> 01:38:51.759
THERE IS ANOTHER KIND OF FOLKS

01:38:51.825 --> 01:38:52.626
THAT ARE MAKING A LOT OF MONEY

01:38:52.693 --> 01:38:54.128
DOING MORE RESPONSIBLE

01:38:54.194 --> 01:38:56.397
INVESTMENTS TO SELL OUT YOU

01:38:56.463 --> 01:38:57.131
KNOW WHAT ONE OF THE THINGS

01:38:57.197 --> 01:38:59.500
THAT DIFFERS FROM THIS IN THE

01:38:59.566 --> 01:39:00.768
KODAK MOMENT IS THAT THE CODE

01:39:00.834 --> 01:39:05.739
ACT FOLKS. I'M YOU WERE UNABLE

01:39:05.806 --> 01:39:08.309
TO RESPOND TO. ADD TO CHANGES

01:39:08.375 --> 01:39:10.978
IN THE MARKET. AND THAT WERE

01:39:11.045 --> 01:39:12.446
LUCKY OF THEIR WORK THEY WERE

01:39:12.513 --> 01:39:14.748
TECHNOLOGICAL AND- CONSUMER

01:39:14.815 --> 01:39:17.384
BASED IN NATURE. OF WHAT WE'RE

01:39:17.451 --> 01:39:20.187
TALKING ABOUT HERE IS. IS A IS

01:39:20.254 --> 01:39:23.290
A MASSIVE GLOBAL POLICY. AND

01:39:23.357 --> 01:39:25.125
POLITICAL PROBLEMS. AND THE

01:39:25.192 --> 01:39:26.527
FACT THAT WHILE WE ALL

01:39:26.593 --> 01:39:28.228
RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE TO WE

01:39:28.295 --> 01:39:29.630
HAVE TO ACT THIS IS AN

01:39:29.697 --> 01:39:32.499
EXISTENTIAL CRISIS FOR. MANKIND

01:39:32.566 --> 01:39:34.401
FOR OUR PLANET- YOU KNOW

01:39:34.468 --> 01:39:36.103
UNFORTUNATELY THERE WILL THERE

01:39:36.170 --> 01:39:37.071
ARE IN THERE WILL CONTINUE TO

01:39:37.137 --> 01:39:40.007
BE- NOT DENIERS AND

01:39:40.074 --> 01:39:42.009
FREELOADERS. WHO ARE GONNA

01:39:42.076 --> 01:39:43.444
CONTINUE TO DOUBLE DOWN AND

01:39:43.510 --> 01:39:44.445
MAKE AS MUCH MONEY AS THEY

01:39:44.511 --> 01:39:49.650
POSSIBLY CAN- AND- SO CAN YOU

01:39:49.717 --> 01:39:51.051
TALK ABOUT THAT DYNAMIC AS WELL

01:39:51.118 --> 01:39:51.852
I MEAN EVERYTHING YOU'RE

01:39:51.919 --> 01:39:53.420
TALKING ABOUT A PRE SUPPOSES

01:39:53.487 --> 01:39:53.921
THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET

01:39:53.987 --> 01:39:54.455
TOGETHER AND DO THE RIGHT

01:39:54.521 --> 01:39:56.623
THING. YEAH WE'RE SO DIVIDED

01:39:56.690 --> 01:39:57.958
NOT ONLY AS A GLOW BUT AS A

01:39:58.025 --> 01:39:59.026
NATION YOU HAD A YOU KNOW

01:39:59.093 --> 01:40:00.461
FORMER PRESIDENT HE WOULD

01:40:00.527 --> 01:40:01.061
LEARNING AROUND KHAN THE WHOLE

01:40:01.128 --> 01:40:06.433
THING A HOAX. I'M SO. IT'S IT

01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:07.801
IT IT DOES FEEL DIFFERENT THAN

01:40:07.868 --> 01:40:10.170
KODAK FOR THAT REASON AND I'D

01:40:10.237 --> 01:40:10.738
LOVE TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON

01:40:10.804 --> 01:40:13.574
THAT. YES I MEAN I THINK. IF

01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:14.842
YOU KNOW IF I REMEMBER MY CASE

01:40:14.908 --> 01:40:15.976
STUDY CORRECTLY THOUGH KODAK

01:40:16.043 --> 01:40:17.277
DID HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY FOR

01:40:17.344 --> 01:40:18.812
DIGITAL FILM THEY JUST NEVER

01:40:18.879 --> 01:40:20.080
SAW IT COMING BECAUSE THEY

01:40:20.147 --> 01:40:20.981
DIDN'T HAVE THEY DIDN'T HAVE

01:40:21.048 --> 01:40:22.282
THE APERTURE OF THE LENS TO

01:40:22.349 --> 01:40:23.517
SUGGESTED THAT BUSINESS MODEL

01:40:23.584 --> 01:40:24.818
LIKE IT DISRUPTED OUT EXISTENCE

01:40:24.885 --> 01:40:25.919
IF THEY DIDN'T SEIZE THAT

01:40:25.986 --> 01:40:27.554
MOMENT BUT- PUTTING THAT ASIDE

01:40:27.621 --> 01:40:28.922
YOU KNOW WHO THIS IS ABSOLUTELY

01:40:28.989 --> 01:40:30.491
VALID POINTS. THAT THERE WILL

01:40:30.557 --> 01:40:31.592
BE PEOPLE THAT WILL OFFER

01:40:31.658 --> 01:40:33.861
ARBITRAGE THE SYSTEM SO IF

01:40:33.927 --> 01:40:35.896
CORPORATES ARE STARVED OF

01:40:35.963 --> 01:40:38.232
CHEAPER LENDING CAPITAL THERE

01:40:38.298 --> 01:40:39.800
WILL BE THOSE THAT WILL COME IN

01:40:39.867 --> 01:40:41.301
AS THE LENDER OF LAST RESORT.

01:40:41.368 --> 01:40:43.370
RESORT IN CHARGE USURIOUS RATES

01:40:43.437 --> 01:40:45.539
BECAUSE THEY ARE THE LENDER OF

01:40:45.606 --> 01:40:46.607
LAST RESORT ARE THE ONLY GAME

01:40:46.673 --> 01:40:48.542
IN TOWN. HOWEVER FOR THOSE

01:40:48.609 --> 01:40:50.310
COMPANIES AND TRYING TO ACCESS

01:40:50.377 --> 01:40:51.512
THAT CAPITAL THAT'S GOING TO

01:40:51.578 --> 01:40:53.614
GET INCREASINGLY MORE DIFFICULT

01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:55.115
AND IT'LL BE EXPENSIVE. SO IT'S

01:40:55.182 --> 01:40:56.417
GOING TO REALLY HIT THEIR

01:40:56.483 --> 01:40:58.519
BOTTOM LINE SO IT IS A POWERFUL

01:40:58.585 --> 01:41:00.854
TOOL TO USE YOU DON'T HAVE

01:41:00.921 --> 01:41:03.157
ACCESS TO CAPITAL. AS AS SHALL

01:41:03.223 --> 01:41:05.592
WE SAY AN INCENTIVE- TO MY

01:41:05.659 --> 01:41:08.061
GREATER CHANGE AND WE CAN ALSO

01:41:08.128 --> 01:41:09.997
SEE IT AND THAT'S JUST NOT DATA

01:41:10.063 --> 01:41:11.899
RUNNING BATTLE. THE PRESSURE IS

01:41:11.965 --> 01:41:13.967
ON THE EQUITY SIDE TO-

01:41:14.034 --> 01:41:15.135
CERTAINLY I'M SURE YOU'RE WELL

01:41:15.202 --> 01:41:17.771
AWARE JUST SUGGESTING. OF THE

01:41:17.838 --> 01:41:19.807
ABSOLUTE AMOUNT OF EQUITY

01:41:19.873 --> 01:41:21.675
VALUES THAT YOU KNOW EXXON'S

01:41:21.742 --> 01:41:23.277
LOST OVER THE LAST SEVERAL

01:41:23.343 --> 01:41:24.945
YEARS COMING OUT OF HERE THE

01:41:25.012 --> 01:41:27.114
FORTUNE FIFTY FOR THE FIRST

01:41:27.181 --> 01:41:29.516
TIME SINCE NINETEEN THIRTIES-

01:41:29.583 --> 01:41:30.484
AND IT'S HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS

01:41:30.551 --> 01:41:33.187
OF BILLIONS OF CAPITAL- PARTLY

01:41:33.253 --> 01:41:35.122
BECAUSE I THINK THE- EQUITY

01:41:35.189 --> 01:41:37.357
COMMUNITY. DIDN'T SEE A CLEAR

01:41:37.424 --> 01:41:40.194
ENOUGH WILLINGNESS OR CLIMATE

01:41:40.260 --> 01:41:42.262
PLAN THAT WAS ARTICULATED TO

01:41:42.329 --> 01:41:43.464
SAY THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE

01:41:43.530 --> 01:41:45.265
ON THE PROGRAM TO TRANSITION.

01:41:45.332 --> 01:41:47.434
AND SO INVESTORS EVEN IN THE

01:41:47.501 --> 01:41:49.436
FOSSIL FUELS INDUSTRY SAID. I'M

01:41:49.503 --> 01:41:50.971
GOING TO MIGRATE THAT CAPITAL

01:41:51.038 --> 01:41:52.172
TO THOSE WHO CAN ARTICULATE A

01:41:52.239 --> 01:41:53.974
BETTER STORY WHICH I THINK IS

01:41:54.041 --> 01:41:55.175
GOING TO BE LONGER TERM

01:41:55.242 --> 01:41:56.343
SUSTAINABLE. AND I DON'T WANT

01:41:56.410 --> 01:41:58.412
TO HOLD THE EQUITY OF PERHAPS

01:41:58.479 --> 01:42:00.080
YOU KNOW COMPANIES THAT DON'T

01:42:00.147 --> 01:42:01.782
ALIGN YOU KNOW WITH MY

01:42:01.849 --> 01:42:04.117
CHRONICLES SO WHILE I DO THINK

01:42:04.184 --> 01:42:05.786
THERE IS A MOMENT IN TIME WHERE

01:42:05.853 --> 01:42:07.221
THOSE ONE ARBITRATION SYSTEM

01:42:07.287 --> 01:42:08.755
CAN MAKE A LOT OF MONEY BECAUSE

01:42:08.822 --> 01:42:15.629
THEY CAN CHARGE YOU KNOW.

01:42:15.696 --> 01:42:16.263
THERE'S USERS RATES AT SOME I'M

01:42:16.330 --> 01:42:17.931
POINT THEY WERE LEFT THEY'LL BE

01:42:17.998 --> 01:42:18.799
HOLDING EMPTY BAG WENT AWAY

01:42:18.866 --> 01:42:19.800
REALLY DOES. BECAUSE I THINK

01:42:19.867 --> 01:42:20.701
IT'S HARD TO ENVISION A WORLD.

01:42:20.767 --> 01:42:21.435
WHERE YOU IF YOU HAVE EVERY.

01:42:21.502 --> 01:42:24.438
CRUNCH IN THE WORLD- ECONOMY IN

01:42:24.505 --> 01:42:26.773
THE WORLD SAYING THAT THEY'RE

01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:29.076
COMMITTING TO THAT ZERO- CHINA

01:42:29.142 --> 01:42:29.943
INCLUDED SOME OF THOSE WHO HAVE

01:42:30.010 --> 01:42:31.478
WORKED SOME OF THE BIGGEST.

01:42:31.545 --> 01:42:32.980
NEWEST CARMEN BETTORS ARE

01:42:33.046 --> 01:42:34.448
SAYING THEY'RE GOING TO GET

01:42:34.515 --> 01:42:35.449
THERE AND I'M NOT SAYING THIS

01:42:35.516 --> 01:42:37.017
WITHOUT IT'S COMPLICATIONS AND

01:42:37.084 --> 01:42:38.051
THERE'S A LOT THAT THEY HAVE TO

01:42:38.118 --> 01:42:38.785
WORK THROUGH IN TERMS OF

01:42:38.852 --> 01:42:40.120
GETTING THINGS LIKE A LONG CALL

01:42:40.187 --> 01:42:41.922
POLICY. BUT THEY MADE A PUBLIC

01:42:41.989 --> 01:42:43.490
COMMITMENT TO GET THERE. AS WE

01:42:43.557 --> 01:42:47.794
LEAD UP TO COST VIRTUALLY.

01:42:47.861 --> 01:42:48.495
EVERY MAJOR NAME. LEAST ONE

01:42:48.562 --> 01:42:51.031
VERY. IS NOW COMMITTING TO NET

01:42:51.098 --> 01:42:52.432
ZERO AND I GENUINELY THINK THE

01:42:52.499 --> 01:42:53.300
FINANCIAL COMMUNITY WILL HOLD

01:42:53.367 --> 01:42:54.868
THEM TO ACCOUNT TO THEIR

01:42:54.935 --> 01:42:56.069
STATEMENTS. I THINK

01:42:56.136 --> 01:42:57.538
INCREASINGLY REGULATORS ARE

01:42:57.604 --> 01:42:58.605
ALSO GONNA HOLD THEM TO

01:42:58.672 --> 01:43:00.707
ACCOUNT. I E. EMPTY PROMISES

01:43:00.774 --> 01:43:03.744
WITHOUT ACTUAL ACTION. IS NOT

01:43:03.810 --> 01:43:04.378
GONNA BE SOMETHING THAT'S GOING

01:43:04.444 --> 01:43:06.313
TO TOLERATE IT OVER TIME. SO

01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:08.248
THAT GLOBAL MOVEMENT THAT'S

01:43:08.315 --> 01:43:09.616
WHERE THE WORLD'S GOING THAT'S

01:43:09.683 --> 01:43:10.217
WHERE THE CAPITAL IS GOING TO

01:43:10.284 --> 01:43:11.084
BE INVESTED THAT'S WHERE THE

01:43:11.151 --> 01:43:12.219
CONSUMERS WANT TO SEE THE

01:43:12.286 --> 01:43:13.654
OUTCOMES THAT'S WHERE REGULARS

01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:14.555
EVERYONE ELSE WE WANT TO GET

01:43:14.621 --> 01:43:16.290
COMES AND IT'S JUST IT'S

01:43:16.356 --> 01:43:17.257
EXISTENTIALISTS. I DO THINK

01:43:17.324 --> 01:43:19.226
THERE IS GOING TO BE A SUNSET

01:43:19.293 --> 01:43:20.794
PROVISION ON THOSE WHO WANT TO

01:43:20.861 --> 01:43:22.262
SAY LET ME JUST SORT OF SHALL

01:43:22.329 --> 01:43:24.631
WE SAY RIDE THIS AND SALES YOU

01:43:24.698 --> 01:43:29.703
KNOW THE PARTIES OVER. WHAT

01:43:29.770 --> 01:43:30.571
WHAT TOOL DO I REGULAR HAVE O

01:43:30.637 --> 01:43:32.973
HOLD THE BIRDS. OR FOR EXAMPLE

01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:34.107
AND COMPANIES IN THOSE

01:43:34.174 --> 01:43:36.977
COUNTRIES ACCOUNTABLE TO THESE.

01:43:37.044 --> 01:43:38.946
THESE GOALS AND PROMISES. I

01:43:39.012 --> 01:43:42.382
DON'T THINK- AND I'M NOT EIGHT

01:43:42.449 --> 01:43:43.784
GLOBAL ECONOMIST OR STRATEGIST

01:43:43.850 --> 01:43:46.286
I DON'T I THINK IT'S VERY HARD

01:43:46.353 --> 01:43:48.388
FOR A COUNTRY WHO IS ON THE

01:43:48.455 --> 01:43:50.591
PATH TO HOLD ANOTHER COUNTRY TO

01:43:50.657 --> 01:43:54.127
ACCOUNT- HOWEVER. YOU KNOW

01:43:54.194 --> 01:43:56.096
THERE IS- I'D SAY YOU KNOW

01:43:56.163 --> 01:43:59.533
GLOBAL PEER PRESSURE TOO LATE

01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:00.434
TO GET THEIR NEXT YEAR LOOK AT

01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:01.134
THE COMMITMENTS ARE HAPPENING

01:44:01.201 --> 01:44:02.169
JUST JUST WATCH AS WE GET

01:44:02.235 --> 01:44:03.470
CLOSER AND CLOSER TO COUGH AND

01:44:03.537 --> 01:44:04.871
SEE HOW MANY MORE COUNTRIES YOU

01:44:04.938 --> 01:44:07.674
KNOW JUMP ON. EVEN MORE- ED

01:44:07.741 --> 01:44:09.943
SAFE RESTIVE COMMITMENTS TO GET

01:44:10.010 --> 01:44:10.944
TO THAT ZERO I THINK THERE IS

01:44:11.011 --> 01:44:13.847
THIS GLOBAL PRESSURE OF

01:44:13.914 --> 01:44:14.548
COUNTRIES TO GO THERE. BUT I

01:44:14.615 --> 01:44:15.983
ALSO THINK IF THE COUNTRY

01:44:16.049 --> 01:44:18.185
LEADERS DON'T ARTICULATE THAT

01:44:18.251 --> 01:44:19.987
THEY'LL BE A WHOLE HOST OF

01:44:20.053 --> 01:44:21.188
OTHER INCENTIVES OR

01:44:21.254 --> 01:44:22.222
DISINCENTIVES TO THOSE

01:44:22.289 --> 01:44:24.191
COUNTRIES ON THE ONE HAND THE

01:44:24.257 --> 01:44:25.826
COUNTRY THAT COMPANIES WITHIN

01:44:25.892 --> 01:44:27.728
THOSE COUNTRIES- YOU KNOW I

01:44:27.794 --> 01:44:29.596
THINK INCREASINGLY CAPITAL WILL

01:44:29.663 --> 01:44:31.164
FLOW THERE IF THE COMPANIES

01:44:31.231 --> 01:44:32.833
AREN'T. TAKING MATTERS INTO

01:44:32.899 --> 01:44:34.334
THEIR OWN ACCOUNT BUT I ALSO

01:44:34.401 --> 01:44:35.535
THINK CITIZENS ARE GOING TO

01:44:35.602 --> 01:44:37.938
ULTIMATELY SAY NO MORE- THERE

01:44:38.005 --> 01:44:39.806
ARE MODELS THAT WE'RE SEEING IN

01:44:39.873 --> 01:44:41.308
COUNTRIES WHERE YOU'VE GOT

01:44:41.375 --> 01:44:43.377
LEADERS WHO ARE SHOWING. REAL

01:44:43.443 --> 01:44:45.078
PROGRESSION IN TERMS OF

01:44:45.145 --> 01:44:47.180
SUSTAINABILITY AND THEY TEND TO

01:44:47.247 --> 01:44:49.282
BE THE COUNTRY'S WHOSE-

01:44:49.349 --> 01:44:50.617
POLITICAL LEADERS ARE

01:44:50.684 --> 01:44:51.785
INCREASINGLY CAPTURING THE

01:44:51.852 --> 01:44:53.086
HEARTS AND MINDS OF THEIR

01:44:53.153 --> 01:44:55.422
CONSTITUENTS. AND AS CLIMATE

01:44:55.489 --> 01:44:57.190
CHANGE BEGETS MORE AND MORE AND

01:44:57.257 --> 01:44:59.159
MORE REAL FOR PEOPLE THAT THE

01:44:59.226 --> 01:45:01.294
TOLERANCE LEVEL OF LIVING IN A

01:45:01.361 --> 01:45:03.263
SOCIETY WITH HIGH POLLUTION

01:45:03.330 --> 01:45:04.698
THIS IS PARTLY WHY I THINK YOU

01:45:04.765 --> 01:45:05.899
KNOW CHINESE RESPOND AS THE

01:45:05.966 --> 01:45:07.501
PEOPLE. YOU KNOW DON'T WANT TO

01:45:07.567 --> 01:45:09.469
WAKE UP AND BARELY BE ABLE TO

01:45:09.536 --> 01:45:11.538
READ THE ERROR OR HAVE YOU KNOW

01:45:11.605 --> 01:45:13.206
YELLOW REVERSE OR WHATEVER YOU

01:45:13.273 --> 01:45:14.341
KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT

01:45:14.408 --> 01:45:15.308
SUSTAINABLE AS A POLITICAL

01:45:15.375 --> 01:45:16.610
LEADER SO I ALSO THINK IN

01:45:16.677 --> 01:45:17.811
SITUATIONS ARE GOING TO DEMAND

01:45:17.878 --> 01:45:18.779
THAT OF THE READERS BUT THAT'S

01:45:18.845 --> 01:45:20.313
GOING TO BE. YEAH THAT'S GONNA

01:45:20.380 --> 01:45:22.082
TAKE SOME TIME I JUST DON'T

01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:22.649
KNOW HOW YOU CAN REACH INTO

01:45:22.716 --> 01:45:23.617
ANOTHER COUNTRY OTHER THAN

01:45:23.684 --> 01:45:25.585
THROUGH PERSECUTION TO SAY YOU

01:45:25.652 --> 01:45:32.926
MUST DO THIS. BUT I THINK. THE

01:45:32.993 --> 01:45:33.460
FORCES AT WORK WILL GET US

01:45:33.527 --> 01:45:37.631
THERE ANYMORE. HI MISTER I

01:45:37.698 --> 01:45:38.198
PLEDGE WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON

01:45:38.265 --> 01:45:40.467
YOUR EARLY. COMMENTS ON- THE

01:45:40.534 --> 01:45:42.069
FIDUCIARY DUTY ELEMENT WHICH IS

01:45:42.135 --> 01:45:43.937
SOMETHING I'VE NOT HEARD OF.

01:45:44.004 --> 01:45:55.849
ANY EEN THE WHAT THE FIDUCIARY.

01:45:55.916 --> 01:45:57.150
DUTY FOR ESP ACTORS AND YOU-

01:45:57.217 --> 01:45:57.718
I'M JUST BECAUSE I KNOW VERY

01:45:57.784 --> 01:45:58.652
ABOUT. THE E. U.'S CORPORATE

01:45:58.719 --> 01:46:02.789
LAW- BUT- YOU KNOW IT'S I WHAT

01:46:02.856 --> 01:46:03.423
ARE THE IN. MECHANISMS FOR THAT

01:46:03.490 --> 01:46:04.624
IS A TYPICALLY RIGHT. IS IT

01:46:04.691 --> 01:46:05.759
PRIVATE LAWSUIT TO THE THEY

01:46:05.826 --> 01:46:07.227
HAVE A THAT FOR RULE THERE-

01:46:07.294 --> 01:46:08.295
SORT OF HOW DOES THAT PRETTY

01:46:08.361 --> 01:46:09.029
SURE YOU DO. IN JUST KIND OF

01:46:09.096 --> 01:46:10.297
LIKE A LITTLE BIT OF A NOT YOU

01:46:10.363 --> 01:46:12.399
SAID TO ENCOURAGE DIRECTORS AND

01:46:12.466 --> 01:46:14.067
OFFICERS WHO ALREADY WANT TO.

01:46:14.134 --> 01:46:16.470
INVEST IN CONSIDER THESE

01:46:16.536 --> 01:46:17.037
FACTORS INTO DOING THE RIGHT

01:46:17.104 --> 01:46:19.439
THING. YES THERE'S DIFFERENT

01:46:19.506 --> 01:46:20.407
THERE ARE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF

01:46:20.474 --> 01:46:23.410
THIS- MANIFESTING IN DIFFERENT

01:46:23.477 --> 01:46:24.978
PLACES BUT THE SUSTAINABLE

01:46:25.045 --> 01:46:27.447
FINANCE DIRECTIVES S. SEVENTY

01:46:27.514 --> 01:46:28.615
ARE WHICH IT WAS WHAT I WAS

01:46:28.682 --> 01:46:30.117
REFERENCING EARLIER THAT CAME

01:46:30.183 --> 01:46:31.985
INTO PLACE IN MARCH OF THIS

01:46:32.052 --> 01:46:34.554
YEAR. IS A PIECE OF REGULATION

01:46:34.621 --> 01:46:37.491
THAT'S GOVERNED BY THE E. U.

01:46:37.557 --> 01:46:39.292
FOR ANY BANKS OR ASSET MANAGERS

01:46:39.359 --> 01:46:41.528
WHICH OPERATED IN THE U. E. L.

01:46:41.595 --> 01:46:44.097
THAT YOU HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE

01:46:44.164 --> 01:46:46.466
THROUGH- DISCLOSURE THAT YOU'RE

01:46:46.533 --> 01:46:48.502
TAKING AND MAKE A COMMITMENT OR

01:46:48.568 --> 01:46:50.670
A STATEMENT. A TESTAMENT THAT

01:46:50.737 --> 01:46:51.505
YOU ARE TAKING THESE INTO

01:46:51.571 --> 01:46:52.939
CONSIDERATION SO THEY'RE USING

01:46:53.006 --> 01:46:56.042
THAT AS A TOOL- BY VIRTUE OF

01:46:56.109 --> 01:46:58.478
THEIR REGULATORY POWERS OVER

01:46:58.545 --> 01:47:00.814
BANKS AND ASSET MANAGERS. ON

01:47:00.881 --> 01:47:01.882
THE ONE HAND AND THEN THE

01:47:01.948 --> 01:47:03.950
COMMON ABOUT THE JUDICIARY DUTY

01:47:04.017 --> 01:47:05.352
SO THESE ARE TWO SEPARATE

01:47:05.418 --> 01:47:07.154
ISSUES SO ONE IS YOU HAVE TO

01:47:07.220 --> 01:47:09.055
DEMONSTRATE THAT YOU'RE TAKING

01:47:09.122 --> 01:47:11.625
ESG INTO ACCOUNT- IN YOUR

01:47:11.691 --> 01:47:12.993
FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND ADVICE

01:47:13.059 --> 01:47:14.828
THAT'S THROUGH THIS S. F. D. R.

01:47:14.895 --> 01:47:16.496
REGULATION WHICH IS GETTING

01:47:16.563 --> 01:47:17.664
EVER AND TODAY IT'S QUITE

01:47:17.731 --> 01:47:18.899
GENERAL BUT THEY ARE GETTING

01:47:18.965 --> 01:47:21.601
EVER MORE PRESCRIPTIVE SO AS AS

01:47:21.668 --> 01:47:22.536
THIS SO IT JUST CAME INTO PLACE

01:47:22.602 --> 01:47:26.106
AND MARCH. BY EARLY NEXT YEAR

01:47:26.173 --> 01:47:26.773
THEY'RE GOING TO EVEN

01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:28.275
PRESCRIBED IN A MUCH MORE

01:47:28.341 --> 01:47:30.744
DETAILED WAY OF HOW THIS HAS TO

01:47:30.811 --> 01:47:32.445
HAPPEN SO TODAY'S MORE GENERAL

01:47:32.512 --> 01:47:33.713
DEMONSTRATIONS THAT YOU'VE DONE

01:47:33.780 --> 01:47:35.715
IT BUT THEY'RE GETTING

01:47:35.782 --> 01:47:37.551
INCREASINGLY MORE PRESCRIPTIVE.

01:47:37.617 --> 01:47:40.153
THAN ON THE PENSION FUND SO

01:47:40.220 --> 01:47:41.955
THIS IS THIS IS A FIDUCIARY

01:47:42.022 --> 01:47:43.456
OBLIGATION AS A PENSION FUND

01:47:43.523 --> 01:47:45.759
TRUSTEE IN SOME JURISDICTIONS

01:47:45.826 --> 01:47:48.128
IS ACTUALLY IN THE LAW- THAT IS

01:47:48.195 --> 01:47:50.063
PART OF YOUR FIDUCIARY DUTY AND

01:47:50.130 --> 01:47:51.665
IN OTHER CASES IT'S CONSIDERED

01:47:51.731 --> 01:47:54.000
WHAT'S BEST PRACTICE. AND SO IF

01:47:54.067 --> 01:47:55.502
YOU'RE A TRUSTEE YOU LOOK TO

01:47:55.569 --> 01:47:56.870
WHAT IS GUIDELINES AS BEST

01:47:56.937 --> 01:47:59.172
PRACTICES SO SOMETIMES IT'S THE

01:47:59.239 --> 01:48:00.507
SAME MANDATORY SOMETIMES IT'S

01:48:00.574 --> 01:48:01.775
MORE OF A KNOWLEDGE SO IT IT'S

01:48:01.842 --> 01:48:03.410
DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT. PARTS

01:48:03.476 --> 01:48:05.278
OF THE WORLD BUT I'D SAY THE

01:48:05.345 --> 01:48:09.816
VAST MAJORITY OF- PENSION

01:48:09.883 --> 01:48:11.952
REGULATIONS EITHER HAS THAT AS

01:48:12.018 --> 01:48:13.887
AN AS A KNOWLEDGE AND A

01:48:13.954 --> 01:48:15.889
GUIDELINE FOR ITS ACTUAL LAW IN

01:48:15.956 --> 01:48:17.691
FACT THE U. S. WAS ONE OF THE

01:48:17.757 --> 01:48:24.731
FEW MAJOR ECONOMIES WHERE. YOU

01:48:24.798 --> 01:48:25.298
WENT THE OTHER WAY UNDER THE

01:48:25.365 --> 01:48:26.132
LAST THIS SHE LED TO PROVE

01:48:26.199 --> 01:48:27.500
TAKING. FACTORS DIFFERENT. DID

01:48:27.567 --> 01:48:30.470
NOT RETURN. BUT THAT'S NOT BE.

01:48:30.537 --> 01:48:32.138
NEVER THAT WILL BE REVERSED

01:48:32.205 --> 01:48:33.607
WITH THE FINEST ALL THE SAME

01:48:33.673 --> 01:48:35.175
SIGNALS AND SIGNS ARE THAT THEY

01:48:35.242 --> 01:48:35.976
WILL FOLLOW SUIT WITH THE REST

01:48:36.042 --> 01:48:37.811
OF THE WORLD. SO THE NUMBER IS

01:48:37.878 --> 01:48:40.146
REQUESTED- I WAS JUST WANTIN

01:48:40.213 --> 01:48:41.548
WHAT WAS SEEN FOR SPENT THOUGH

01:48:41.615 --> 01:48:42.983
OF IT LIKE IF SOMEBODY DOESN'T

01:48:43.049 --> 01:48:44.184
FOLLOW HAVE THERE BEEN ANY

01:48:44.251 --> 01:48:45.585
EXAMPLES OF ENFORCEMENT ACTION

01:48:45.652 --> 01:48:47.220
IS THERE EVIDENCE THAT. THIS IS

01:48:47.287 --> 01:48:50.657
ACTUALLY CAUSING A CHANGE IN

01:48:50.724 --> 01:48:51.191
BEHAVIOR FROM PENSION FUND

01:48:51.258 --> 01:48:52.525
INVESTORS. WELL YES YES YES FOR

01:48:52.592 --> 01:48:55.896
SURE- BECAUSE WE SEE IT IN. THE

01:48:55.962 --> 01:48:57.464
AMOUNT OF PENSION FUND MONEY

01:48:57.530 --> 01:48:58.665
THAT WANTS TO GET INVESTED IN

01:48:58.732 --> 01:49:00.233
ESG STRATEGIES SO THIS BIG

01:49:00.300 --> 01:49:02.135
GROWTH THAT WE'RE SEEING. IN

01:49:02.202 --> 01:49:03.737
THE MARKETS IT IS NOT JUST

01:49:03.803 --> 01:49:05.005
COMING FROM YOUR CLASSIC-

01:49:05.071 --> 01:49:07.207
PRIVATE ASSET MANAGERS- BUT

01:49:07.274 --> 01:49:08.541
IT'S ALSO COMING FROM THE

01:49:08.608 --> 01:49:10.477
PENSION FUND INDUSTRY. PENSION

01:49:10.543 --> 01:49:12.045
FUNDS ARE SAYING I MUST GET

01:49:12.112 --> 01:49:12.913
INVESTED IN THESE ESG

01:49:12.979 --> 01:49:15.015
STRATEGIES. SO YES IT'S

01:49:15.081 --> 01:49:16.783
ABSOLUTELY CHANGING BEHAVIOR AS

01:49:16.850 --> 01:49:18.251
PART OF THE DYNAMIC THAT'S

01:49:18.318 --> 01:49:20.253
UNDERPINNING THE GROWTH RATES-

01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:22.188
BUT WHAT DO REGULATORS ANY

01:49:22.255 --> 01:49:23.423
REGULARS HAVE THE POWER AT

01:49:23.490 --> 01:49:24.958
THEIR DISPOSAL. IF YOU WERE NOT

01:49:25.025 --> 01:49:27.460
TO COMPLY- THEN YOU KNOW THEY

01:49:27.527 --> 01:49:28.762
HAVE LOTS OF POWERS AT THEIR

01:49:28.828 --> 01:49:31.264
DISPOSAL THEY COULD FIND YOU-

01:49:31.331 --> 01:49:32.432
THEY COULD PROHIBIT YOU FROM

01:49:32.499 --> 01:49:34.367
DOING CERTAIN TYPES OF BUSINESS

01:49:34.434 --> 01:49:36.336
NOW A LOT OF THIS IS. NEW SO-

01:49:36.403 --> 01:49:38.371
PARTICULAR SAYS FDR SO IT'S

01:49:38.438 --> 01:49:41.107
ONLY ONLY JUST COMING MARCH SO

01:49:41.174 --> 01:49:42.075
THERE ISN'T ENOUGH OF THAT

01:49:42.142 --> 01:49:43.810
HISTORY THERE TO SAY FOR THOSE

01:49:43.877 --> 01:49:45.745
WHO ARE COMPLYING. YOU KNOW

01:49:45.812 --> 01:49:47.580
WHAT IS WHAT WHAT HAVE THEY

01:49:47.647 --> 01:49:49.816
DONE IN TERMS OF THE- FOLLOWING

01:49:49.883 --> 01:49:51.384
THROUGH ON THAT LEGISLATION.

01:49:51.451 --> 01:49:53.219
BUT AGAIN WHEN YOU HAVE A

01:49:53.286 --> 01:49:54.554
REGULAR TELLING YOU AS A

01:49:54.621 --> 01:49:55.755
REGULATED ENTITY YOU MUST DO

01:49:55.822 --> 01:49:57.691
THIS- THE ENTIRE FINANCIAL

01:49:57.757 --> 01:49:59.059
COMMUNITY HAS RESPONDED ON

01:49:59.125 --> 01:50:00.794
WE'VE ALL. WORKED IN OUR S. F.

01:50:00.860 --> 01:50:04.998
E. R- DISCLOSURES THIS YEAR. SO

01:50:05.065 --> 01:50:06.333
I'D SAY YOU KNOW I CAN'T THINK

01:57:35.381 --> 01:57:37.850
BACK TO THE IDEA THAT IT'S A

01:57:37.917 --> 01:57:39.352
WIN WIN FOR EVERYBODY SO THE

01:57:39.419 --> 01:57:41.254
ISSUERS CAN ACCESS DEDICATED

01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:42.789
POOLS OF CAPITAL FROM THESE

01:57:42.855 --> 01:57:46.325
COMMITTED ESG INVESTORS AT VERY-ATTRACTIVE RATES. THE COMPANIES

01:57:46.392 --> 01:57:48.694
THEMSELVES CAN ISSUED TO INVEST

01:57:48.761 --> 01:57:49.962
THAT MONEY AND POSITIVE

01:57:50.029 --> 01:57:52.031
OUTCOMES THAT CAN BOTH HELP

01:57:52.098 --> 01:57:53.366
MITIGATE CLIMATE CHANGE

01:57:53.433 --> 01:57:54.967
OBVIOUSLY GOOD FOR ALL OF US

01:57:55.034 --> 01:58:03.009
BUT ALSO HELP ON THE SOCIAL.

01:58:03.075 --> 01:58:03.609
SIDE WITH THEIR OWN EMPLOYEES

01:58:03.676 --> 01:58:04.410
SO I THINK IT'S AN- AND- OF

01:58:04.477 --> 01:58:06.012
BEING- COMPREHEND. AND THINKING

01:58:06.078 --> 01:58:08.781
OF WHAT'S IT CAN MEAN FROM THE

01:58:08.848 --> 01:58:10.750
BEST MASSAGE AND MAYBE HEALTH

01:58:10.817 --> 01:58:15.087
COULD DO. YOU. ISSUE YOUR OWN

01:58:15.154 --> 01:58:15.688
GREENER OR BY. AND PICK THE

01:58:15.755 --> 01:58:16.289
AREA THAT YOU ARE IMPORTANT-

01:58:16.355 --> 01:58:16.889
WHERE YOU WANTED PLAY CATCH.

01:58:16.956 --> 01:58:18.491
IT'S WAY JUST LIKE ANY ON IS

01:58:18.558 --> 01:58:21.694
NOT LIMITED TO CORPORATE. SO SO

01:58:21.761 --> 01:58:24.630
HOPEFULLY THAT'S LIKE A- A

01:58:24.697 --> 01:58:29.702
LITTLE INCENTIVE. TO SORT OF

01:58:29.769 --> 01:58:30.336
THINK HOLISTICALLY AND BROUGHT.

01:58:30.403 --> 01:58:31.737
ABOUT THIS- STAND TOP AND THEN

01:58:31.804 --> 01:58:33.206
SECONDOF YOUR I WAS MY TRIP

01:58:33.272 --> 01:58:37.343
RIGHT. YOU SEE THE SECOND PART

01:58:37.410 --> 01:58:39.111
OF MICHAEL. YEAH I SAID I WAS

01:58:39.178 --> 01:58:41.681
ON IT WAS. AND I'VE YOU I THINK

01:58:41.747 --> 01:58:43.316
YOU INTERNET WAS ASKING ABOUT

01:58:43.382 --> 01:58:44.917
OKAY YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT DID MS

01:58:44.984 --> 01:58:47.186
DO THAT MY FOLLOW UP TO THAT SO

01:58:47.253 --> 01:58:49.288
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. COULD

01:58:49.355 --> 01:58:52.758
ISSUED GREEN BONDS AND GET VERY

01:58:52.825 --> 01:58:53.359
ATTRACTIVE INTEREST RATES ON

01:58:53.426 --> 01:58:54.994
THOSE IN THE CURRENT CLIMATE AT

01:58:55.061 --> 01:58:57.597
LEAST- IF AS LONG AS THEY

01:58:57.663 --> 01:58:58.764
IDENTIFIED THAT THOSE PROCEEDS

01:58:58.831 --> 01:58:59.932
ARE GOING TO BE USED

01:58:59.999 --> 01:59:03.369
SPECIFICALLY FOR. THESE

01:59:03.436 --> 01:59:06.372
APPROACH GREEN INVESTMENTS OR

01:59:06.439 --> 01:59:07.273
FOR OR JUST TRANSITION SUCH AS

01:59:07.340 --> 01:59:08.574
MUCH RIGHT TO COULD BE

01:59:08.641 --> 01:59:12.411
ESCALATED SIGNIFICANT WAY TO-

01:59:12.478 --> 01:59:15.448
TO DECREASE OUR COST OF

01:59:15.515 --> 01:59:17.450
CAPITAL- FOR THOSE KINDS OF

01:59:17.517 --> 01:59:19.952
BONDS AS YOU GO FOR. NOW WHAT

01:59:20.019 --> 01:59:22.588
WHAT COMES TO MY- IS.

01:59:22.655 --> 01:59:24.423
CONSTANTLY WE SEE IT IN L. A.

01:59:24.490 --> 01:59:27.026
N. IN THE WORLD PEOPLE FIND

01:59:27.093 --> 01:59:28.461
WAYS TO MANIPULATE WHATEVER

01:59:28.528 --> 01:59:31.063
SITUATION IS OUT THERE- I SEE

01:59:31.130 --> 01:59:34.333
RIGHT IN I CAN IMAGINE RIGHT

01:59:34.400 --> 01:59:34.967
NOW WITH THINGS BEING OVER SO.

01:59:35.034 --> 01:59:36.269
INTEREST RATES ARE VERY LOW AT

01:59:36.335 --> 01:59:38.638
THIS POINT TIME I WOULD IMAGINE

01:59:38.704 --> 01:59:39.772
WE WILL HAVE JUST AS YOU

01:59:39.839 --> 01:59:40.973
POINTED OUT THERE ARE PEOPLE

01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:42.508
THAT ARE GOING TO ARBITRAGE AND

01:59:42.575 --> 01:59:44.243
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO. TRY TO

01:59:44.310 --> 01:59:45.378
MANIPULATE THE SYSTEM THAT

01:59:45.444 --> 01:59:47.980
THERE WILL BE PEOPLE TRYING TO

01:59:48.047 --> 01:59:49.181
DO THAT IDENTIFYING THAT THIS

01:59:49.248 --> 01:59:51.017
IS A GREEN BOND WHEN IT'S YOU

01:59:51.083 --> 01:59:52.919
KNOW OUR IS IT REALLY GOING TO

01:59:52.985 --> 01:59:54.020
BE THAT AND SO THAT'S WHERE

01:59:54.086 --> 01:59:55.888
THE- THAT'S WHERE THE STANDARD

01:59:55.955 --> 01:59:57.323
ACCOUNTABILITY PRACTICES COME

01:59:57.390 --> 01:59:58.791
IN AND THE PROPER DEFINITIONS

01:59:58.858 --> 02:00:00.526
COMEY AND- PICK CENTER I

02:00:00.593 --> 02:00:02.662
ASSUME. TERMS OF YOU KNOW HOW

02:00:02.728 --> 02:00:04.764
DO WE ENFORCE THAT AND HOW DO

02:00:04.830 --> 02:00:07.833
WE- DEVELOP DATA AS IT MOVES

02:00:07.900 --> 02:00:09.502
TOWARD A CERTAIN PRACTICES.

02:00:09.569 --> 02:00:11.938
THAT'S THAT VERY MUCH SO YES I

02:00:12.004 --> 02:00:14.607
DO SO- THERE IS A STANDARD IN

02:00:14.674 --> 02:00:16.842
THE MARKET- FOR WHAT IS DEFINED

02:00:16.909 --> 02:00:19.512
AS GREEN- FROM WHEN WE'RE

02:00:19.579 --> 02:00:21.147
TALKING ABOUT THIS ACCESSING

02:00:21.213 --> 02:00:23.249
THE DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS. SO

02:00:23.316 --> 02:00:25.985
TODAY WE HAVE FRAMEWORKS AND

02:00:26.052 --> 02:00:27.587
THEY'RE QUITE RIGOROUS AND

02:00:27.653 --> 02:00:29.589
TYPICALLY ISSUERS OF GREEN OR

02:00:29.655 --> 02:00:31.524
SOCIAL BONDS WILL HAVE A THIRD

02:00:31.591 --> 02:00:33.559
PARTY INSURANCE PROVIDER THAT

02:00:33.626 --> 02:00:35.027
LOOKS AT THE USE OF PROCEEDS

02:00:35.094 --> 02:00:36.829
AND SAYS YES THIS DOES COMPLY

02:00:36.896 --> 02:00:38.831
WITH WHAT MARKET STANDARD IS.

02:00:38.898 --> 02:00:41.000
AND WHEN THAT IS THAN THE LAST

02:00:41.067 --> 02:00:42.902
BY FOLLOWING THOSE FRAMEWORKS

02:00:42.969 --> 02:00:44.437
THEN THOSE SECURITIES CAN BE

02:00:44.503 --> 02:00:47.139
PART OF THE GREEN BOND INDICES

02:00:47.206 --> 02:00:48.608
AND THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT TO

02:00:48.674 --> 02:00:49.909
BOTH FROM THE AFTER MARKET

02:00:49.976 --> 02:00:51.177
TRADING POINT OF VIEW BUT ALSO

02:00:51.243 --> 02:00:52.645
IN TERMS OF. THE ISSUE IS

02:00:52.712 --> 02:00:54.480
FUTURE ACCESS TO GREEN CAPITAL

02:00:54.547 --> 02:00:56.816
SO- THAT'S ACTUALLY QUITE A-

02:00:56.882 --> 02:00:59.552
WELL DEFINED AND NOW REASONABLY

02:00:59.619 --> 02:01:01.887
MATURE PROCESS AND THAT'LL THAT

02:01:01.954 --> 02:01:03.356
I THINK- IS AND SHALL WE SAY

02:01:03.422 --> 02:01:05.091
KEEPS THE ISSUE AS HONEST. AND

02:01:05.157 --> 02:01:07.026
AVOID GREENWASHING SO SOME OF

02:01:07.093 --> 02:01:08.561
THESE STANDARDS THAT ARE. BEING

02:01:08.628 --> 02:01:09.962
CREATED AS AS THESE MARKETS

02:01:10.029 --> 02:01:12.431
MATURE ARE HELPING TO CREATE

02:01:12.498 --> 02:01:14.900
INTEGRITY TO THE MARKETS AND
