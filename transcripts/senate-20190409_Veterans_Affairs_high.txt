THE MOST RECENT AMENDMENTS HAVE LIMITED THIS BILL TO DOGS AND CATS ONLY AND I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ME STAFF FOR THEIR INPUT ON THESE CHANGES. THIS BILL WOULD WAIVE ADOPTION FEES AT LOCAL PUBLIC ANIMAL SHELTERS FOR MILITARY VETERANS. MANY OF WHOM SEEK EMOTIONAL SUPPORT ANIMAL COMPANIONS THE PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO NEARLY TWO MILLION VETERANS. SOME OF WHOM ARE COPING WITH PTSD OR OTHER SERVICE RELATED MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. THIS LEGISLATION WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO ALL VETERANS IN RECOGNITION OF THEIR SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY. BUT THOSE WHO TURN TO ANIMAL COMPANIONS BUT WITH YES IN OTHER MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. ANIMAL COMPANIONS HAVE SHOWN HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO LOWER DEPRESSION. LOWER LEVELS OF THE SOCIAL ISOLATION AND PROVIDE AN OVERALL GREATER SATISFACTION WITH LIFE. AS A LONGTIME DOG OWNER I CAN ATTEST TO THE JOY OF A PET RINGS ONE'S LIFE. IS LEGISLATION WAS MADE FOR PEOPLE LIKE LORRAINE. CNN WHO I RECENTLY MET WITH IN MY DISTRICT OFFICE SHE AS A US ARMY ARMY VETERAN WHO SERVED SIX YEARS IN IRAQ. AFTER RETURNING HOME LORRAINE SOUGHT. THE COMFORT AND COMPANIONSHIP. OF AN EMOTIONAL SUPPORT ANIMAL. SAID TO BORROW MONEY FROM A FAMILY MEMBER TO PAY FOR HER NEW AT OTHER VETERANS TO NOT HAVE THAT OPTION.

IN CAN CALM ME DOWN SHE WAKES ME UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WHEN I'M HAVING NIGHTMARES. AND JUST KNOWS WHAT I'M OVERALL HAVING A BAD DAY AND IS THERE TO COME. ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THAT I FOUND MY YEAH. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ALEX TOURISM OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF VETERANS SERVICE AGENCIES I WOULD JUST ACT ECHO MISTER REED'S COMMENTS -- THE SUPPORT THAT THESE ANIMALS PROVIDE TO VETERANS IS IMMEASURABLE THERE'S A GROWING. BASELINE OF SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE BENEFITS THAT IT OFFERS THESE VETERANS -- WOULD URGE AND I STRONGLY SUPPORT THANK YOU SO MUCH. ANY OTHER COME. NOW LET ME OPEN UP THE QUESTIONS TO THE FOR MY FELLOW -- COLLEAGUES. SENATOR RICHARD ROTH. I WILL BE UP. I AM A LITTLE OF TERM. THE S. TO THE STANDARDS USED% QUALIFY TO HAVE THE WORD VETERAN ADDED TO THE DRIVER'S LICENSE THERE WERE SOME ISSUES. OF A FEW MONTHS AGO AS SOON AS A BEEN RESOLVED CALVET I JUST AS TAKE A LOOK AT IT TO MAKE SURE THAT. WHATEVER THE STANDARDS ARE THAT THEY'RE NOT -- OVERLY RESTRICTIVE AND ELIMINATE THE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME VETERANS -- TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOUR BILL AND THEN THE OTHER POINT I WOULD MAKE IS OF SOME OF US DON'T HAVE VETERAN. ID CARD BUT HAVE OTHER GOVERNMENT ISSUED. CARDS THAT CLEARLY INDICATE THAT WERE VETERAN SO -- IT WOULD MAKE IT A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO UTILIZE THIS UNLESS WE WANT TO GO DOWN. THE LOCAL -- CVS SO WHEN IT THE LETTER AND THEN GO TO THE DMV. HAVE ANOTHER RIGHT DRIVER'S LICENSE ISSUE SO. YOU MIGHT BE ABLE AS YOU MOVE THROUGH THIS TO JUST ADDRESS THAT. WITH A SIMPLE SET. BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO MOVE ABILITY OF CORPORATE POINT. THANKS VERY MUCH REATER. THANK YOU FOR MOVING THE BILL -- ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS -- AND IS THERE ANYONE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. COME UP THE BEST MICROPHONE OF SPORT. ANY WHEN IN OPPOSITION THE BILL SEE NONE. THEN I WOULD GO AHEAD AND ENTER CHIANG LESIA YOUR CLOSING REMARKS. I HAD JUST. RESPECTFULLY ASK. AND THE OTHER SECRETARY FOR YOU -- NOW THAT WE'VE GOT WE'RE GOING TO SEND THIS ON AND WE'RE GONNA MOVE THE BILL ON WITH YOU WITH THE BOAT. WE'LL SEND IT ON TO APPROPRIATIONS SO. I CAN HAVE THE ROLL CALL. SENATE BILL TWO FORTY FIVE DO YOU HAVE TO FIRST [inaudible] ASIANS. ARCHULETA YES HI I BROUGH I NIELSEN [inaudible] ROCK [inaudible] I NUMBER [inaudible] WILK [inaudible] WELL I WE'RE GONNA KEEP THE ROLE OPEN WE'VE GOT A FEW THAT IT WILL BRING IN. THE COMPLETE THE ROLE BUT IT WILL PASS IT ON TO APPROACH. SOMEONE. YOU'RE. ALL OF THAT WE WERE IN THE THE NEXT -- ONE HIS S. SENATE BILL FIVE HUNDRED MIKE MORRELL. AND GOOD AFTERNOON A GOOD AFTERNOON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU GUYS READY. YOU'RE READY OKAY I'M READY. WELL GOOD AFTERNOON. SB. FIVE HUNDRED IS A PLAN TO ACCEPT YOUR AB TO EXPAND CAREER OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR STATES -- RETURNING. THIS DISABLED VETERANS THE BILL WOULD CREATE A GRADUATE LEVEL EDUCATION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR DISABLED VETS. DURAN ABLE TO GET THE SAME AID FEDERAL LEVEL. SB FIVE HUNDRED AS THE MODEL AFTER THE FEDERAL GI BILL AS WELL AS A SIMILAR. LOCATION VALIDATION PROGRAM THAT IS OFFERED TO SOME DISABLED VETERANS. CURRENTLYDISABLED VETERANS MAY BE ENTITLED TO THE FEDERAL. CATION ALL -- PROGRAM BUT LACKS. TRANSPARENCY AND QUALIFIED APPLICANTS MAY BE DENIED BENEFITS WITH LITTLE TO NO EXPLANATIONS. SO WE WANT ENSURE THE CALIFORNIA VETERANS ARE DISABLED VETERANS ARE NOT THE NIGHT. OF THEIR BENEFITS AND CREATIVE PROGRAM HERE. ARE THE CIVILIAN JOB MARKET IS BECOMING MORE MORE COMPETITIVE AS I THINK WE ALL KNOW. AND HAVING A BACHELORS DEGREE SOMETIMES IS NOT ALWAYS ENOUGH FOR THE ENTRY LEVEL POSITIONS SO WE KNOW THAT PATRONS. ARE TYPICALLY HARD WORKING PROFESSIONAL LEADERS BUT DO NOT ALWAYS STAND OUT ON APPLICATIONS LIKE VETERANS FROM PAST GENERATIONS. SO BY CREATING A PATH FOR THE STUDENTS TO STRIVE AND THRIVE FOR THEIR MASTER'S DEGREE WE WILL BE INVESTING. IN THEIR FUTURES AND OF COURSE THE FEATURE OF CALIFORNIA WILL STRENGTHENING OUR WORKFORCE SO IT'S NO SECRET. THAT WHEN VETERANS RETURN OF THE WORK FORCE FROM THE SERVICE IT YIELDS POSITIVE RESULTS AND SO WITH ME TODAY AS MY FRIEND ON BEHALF OF THIS BILL. AND CONSTITUENT RICHARD ABOUT THE HOUSE FROM THE DISABLED AMERICAN VETERANS [inaudible] SO SPEECH. THANK YOU ARE CHAIRMAN ARCHULETA FOR THE SOME TO SPEAK ON SB -- FIVE HUNDRED AGAIN MY NAME'S RICHARD VALDEZ AND I'M THE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE DISABLED AMERICAN VETERANS DEPARTMENT CALIFORNIA I'M ALSO A VIETNAM VETERAN.

I LIKE TO START OFF BY SEVENTEEN OF COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS OFFERED BY THE COMMITTEE WHICH WOULD CLARIFY THE USAGE CONDITIONS OF THE READ THE ARMORY. AND WHICH ARE BEFORE YOU TODAY AND DRAFT AMENDMENT FORM. AND WILL BE TAKEN AND GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE. I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK OUR CHAIR AND RUNNING. ABOUT DEAL WITH THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH OUR OFFICE ON THESE IMPORTANT AND AMENDMENTS. SENATE BILL FIVE A ONE WILL HELP A SMALL COMMUNITY IN THE SOUTHERN CENTRAL VALLEY BETWEEN AN ARMORY THAT WILL HELP SERVE OUR VETERANS IN THE REGION. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THE READ LEE AREA. VETERANS HAVE OPERATED B. R. ARMORY FOR VARIOUS EVENTS INCLUDING VETERAN SERVICES. THE REALLY AREA VETS WORK TO HELP RETURNING VETERANS WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET THROUGH RENTAL ASSISTANCE TO WORKING WITH CONDITIONS. LIKE THE JOE LOST MEMORIAL FOUNDATION TO PROVIDE RESOURCES. FOOD AND ASSISTANCE WITH MEDICAL COST ABOUT IT VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES. THE CITY OF RIDLEY IS INVESTED IN MAKING SURE THE ARMORY STAYS IN THE COMMUNITY FOR PURPOSES OF SERVING OUR VETERANS. AND ALREADY WORKS TO MAINTAIN THE ARMORY INCLUDING THE LAWN AND LANDSCAPE BEING I WORKS OF NONPROFIT ENTITY STRUCTURE VETERANS SERVICES ARE ACCESSIBLE TO VETERANS IN THE REGION. HOWEVER WHILE THE ROOM RIDLEY ARMORY WAS AUTHORIZED FOR CELL BY A. B. THIRTY TO FIFTY ONE THE SALE OF THE ARMORY PARCEL HAS BEEN POSTPONED. AND THE CITY OF RIDLEY HAS BEEN WORKING WITH THE STATE TO TRY TO KEEP THE ARMORY. THE REALLY ARMORY SERVES AS A CRITICAL ACCESS POINT VETERANS IN THE RIDLEY AND SURROUNDING REGION. OFTEN HAVE. HAVE TO A DIFFICULT TIME ACCEPTING A NEARBY AMERICAN LEGION POSTER NEARBY VETERANS. SERVANT SERVING ORGANIZATION. FOR EXAMPLE THE NEAREST VETERANS MEMORIAL DISTRICT IS IN OFFICE OVER TWO HOURS AWAY BY PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. AND FORTY MINUTES AWAY BY OUR SB FIVE ALL ONE WOULD HELP ENSURE THAT OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES AND VERY AND VETERANS ALSO HAVE ACCESS TO THESE CRITICAL SERVICES. AND I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY ON THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE WITH ME TODAY I HAVE. ALL THE WELL WITH THE CITY OF RIDLEY AND AFTER A JEWEL AT THE TENT -- THE AMERICAN LEGION POST THIRTY FIVE MY TURN. WELL I AM ANTHONY JEWEL OF THE AMERICAN LEGION POST THIRTY FIVE FRESNO COUNTY COMMUNITY OF READ LEE CALIFORNIA. I'M HERE TODAY TO ENCOURAGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR OUR VETERANS CONTINUED USE OF OUR FORMER NATIONAL GUARD ARMORY. YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT OUR VETERANS HAVE BEEN EXCELLENT STEWARDS OF THE PROPERTY NOT ONLY HAVE WE PROVIDED CUSTODIAL CARE. BUT WE'VE MADE IMPROVEMENTS SUCH AS REMODELING THE KITCHEN APPLIANCES AND ALSO CONVERTING. THE MEN SHOWER AREA INTO A WOMEN'S ADA COMPLIANT Là TRAIN. WE DID THESE IMPROVEMENTS AT OUR COST. OUR AREA VETERANS HAVE REGARDED THE ARMORY AS COMMUNITY PROPERTY. AND AS SUCH WE HAVE SHARED THE PROPERTY BY HOSTING SCHOOL DISTRICT EVENTS OR CIVIC EVENTS SUCH AS THE RECENT KOREAN VISITORS DELEGATION. WELL THERE HAVE BEEN CELEBRATE TORY OCCASIONS OF ALSO BEEN THOSE OF FINAL RESPECT FOR THE FAMILIES OF OUR FALLEN VETERANS. FINANCIALLY. MANY OF THOSE FAMILIES MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO AFFORD A RECEPTION ALL. AT THE ARMORY NOT BEEN AVAILABLE. MANY CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES HAVE THE BENEFIT OF A SUSTAINED. HOME GUARD OR NATIONAL GUARD. TO ASSIST IN EMERGENCIES OR DISASTER PREPAREDNESS. THAT ABSENCE INOUR COMMUNITY CAN BE PARTIALLY RESTORED BY AND JOINING THE CITY OF READ LIKE. A SHARE THE ARMORY WITH THE VETERANS AS AN EMERGENCY FACILITY. THE PROPERTY AND THE FACILITY HAVE AND CAN PROVIDE UNIQUE POTENTIAL LOGISTICAL SUPPORT. THE BUILDING FLOOR IS AT GRADE. AND WITH A FOURTEEN BY FOURTEEN ROLL UP DOOR. TRANSFER. OF EMERGENCY SUPPLIES. EMERGENCY ELECTRICAL SERVICE CAN BE EASILY ACCESSED WITH A SMALL MODIFICATION TO PROVIDE AN EXTERNAL. ELECTRICAL GENERATOR FOR SUPPORT. IN SUMMARY WE HOPE THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT THAT THE RIDLEY ARMORY IS TO OUR VETERANS AND TO OUR COMMUNITY. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING. THANK YOU FOR THAT. THANK YOU SENATORS I AM THE COALS EVEN ON THE CITY MANAGER FOR THE CITY OF BRIEFLY AND I'D LIKE TO EXPLAIN TO YOU THAT THE CITY OF RIDLEY IS. A CITY OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND POPULATION VERY SMALL WORLD BASED AGRICULTURAL BASED COMMUNITY. WERE 76% LOW INCOME HISPANIC POPULATION. SO THE VETERANS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. WERE BORN IN POVERTY BASICALLY THEY SERVE THEIR COUNTRY THEY COME BACK THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY EXIT POVERTY AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER THE COURSE OF THE PAST DECADE IS THEY'VE GOTTEN TOGETHER. FORM TO THEIR OWN NONPROFIT ENTITY NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CITY I'M VERY PROUD TO SAY THEY'VE DONE THIS ON THEIR OWN AND FOR OVER A DECADE. OF USE THAT FACILITY FOR FUNDRAISING SO THAT EVERY FUNDS ALL THE FUNDS THEY RAISE. PROVIDE VETERANS SERVICES THEY HAVEN'T ASKED THE CITY FOR A DIME THEY'VE DONE THIS ON THEIR OWN THE ONLY SUPPORT THE CITY HAS BEEN ABLE TO GIVE THEM IS. TOO LONG FOR THEM. AND SO RIGHT NOW THEY'RE IN A STATE OF FRANKLY PANIC BECAUSE THEY'VE PROVIDED SERVICES FOR SO LONG. IN THE REGION WHERE WE ARE WE ARE A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY WE ARE A DRAW THE ARMORY IS A DRAW FOR VETERANS NOT JUST WITHIN RIDLEY. I WOULD SAY PROBABLY IN A FIFTY MILE SURROUNDING AREA AND THESE VETERANS KNOW THEY AN GO TO THE ARMORY FOR SERVICES -- WE DON'T DISAGREE WITH THE NATIONAL GUARD STRATEGY FOR NEW ARMORIES I THINK IT'S A BRILLIANT STRATEGY -- AND AS A SURPLUS OFF THE ARMORIES. WE UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY THE DIFFERENCE HERE IN REALLY IS THAT OUR ARMY HAS BEEN IN USE BY VETERANS FOR VETERANS. THAT'S DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT THAN THESE OTHER ARMORIES THAT HAVE BEEN VACANT. THE OTHER DIFFERENCE IS. THE OTHER ARM RESERVING SURPLUS OFFERING COMMUNITIES OF WE WE TALK TO THE NATIONAL GUARD ABOUT THE ONE THEY JUST SOLD IN SANTA BARBARA -- OVER MILLION DOLLARS IN READ LEAVE BECAUSE WERE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND POPULATION THAT IS LOW INCOME -- POVERTY POCKET AN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OF ALMOST 20%. WE CANNOT. COME UP WITH THE HALF MILLION DOLLARS THAT THEY WANT FOR THIS PROP. AND SO GRACIOUSLY SENATOR D'AMATO HAS RUN SB FIVE A ONE ON BEHALF OF THE REALLY AREA VETERANS. AND I'M HERE TO SAY THAT WE SUPPORT THE READ THE AREA VETERANS THE CITY DOES. IN AS MANY WAYS AS WE CAN -- WE'RE WE'RE HERE TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THEY HAVE BEEN SUCH GREAT STEWARDS OF THE STATE'S PROPERTY THEY HAVE REMODELED ON THEIR OWN THEY HAVE RAISE MONEY ON THEIR OWN. THEY WANT TO CONTINUE PROVIDING SERVICES TO THE VETS -- I UNDERSTAND THE WERE AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL AND WE COMPLETELY SUPPORT THOSE AMENDMENTS THE CITY. SUPPORTS WHAT THE REALLY AREA VETERANS WANT TO DO IN TERMS OF INSTALLING A TRACK SYSTEMS EVERYTHING THEY'VE DONE OVER THE COURSE OF THE PAST DECADE THEY'VE BEEN IN A BUILDING THAT IS NOT ADA COMPLIANT AND HAS NO AIR CONDITIONING OF EATING. AND THEY'VE STILL BEEN ABLE TO MAKE. LEMONADE OUT OF LEMONS ESSENTIALLY. AND SO WE ARE A SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT COMMUNITY AND YOU WILL FIND THESE OTHER ARMORIES. AND WE JUST PUT WOULD PLEAD WITH YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT OUR VETERANS. HAVE TROUBLE BECAUSE WE ARE LOW INCOME COMMUNITY HAVE TROUBLE GETTING UP TO FRESNO FOR SERVICES. AND WE HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL THEY HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN PULLING THOSE SERVICES DOWNTURN BRIEFLY. SO THAT SURROUNDING COMMUNITY VETERANS AND ACCESS SERVICES THEY WOULDN'T OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO ACCESS SO WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON SENATOR. THIS BILL. YEAH. ONE SENATOR IS YOUR ANY OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL PLEASE COME FORWARD [inaudible] ANYONE -- IS IN THE IS THERE ANYONE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS SET THREE WITH THREE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS REPRESENTING NATIONAL GUARD ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA AND SUPPORT [inaudible] SENATE ROTH [inaudible] THANK YOU. FIRST LET ME GO. MAKE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE BILL I OBVIOUSLY SUPPORT. TO SUPPORTING VETERANS BOTH IN-RURAL AREAS AND FRANKLY -- OUR STATE AND NATION [inaudible] THE RESERVE FREEDOM FOR US AND THEY DESERVE THE APPROPRIATE ACTION FROM US WHEN WHEN THEY NEED HELP. I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS I'VE SPENT -- ABOUT SIX I SPENT SIX YEARS ACTUALLY IS THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE FOUR CHAIR WHICH DEALT WITH ARMORIES. OUR RESEARCH SURPLUS SINGER MARIE DISPOSITION AND THE REST INCLUDING OUR WORRY [inaudible] RENOVATION -- AND MY CONCERNS HAVE TO DO WITH THAT A MAYES YOU MAY KNOW. WE HAVE ABOUT EIGHTY ARMORIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT ARE IN NEED OF RENOVATION MANY OF THESE WERE BUILT IN THE FORTIES AND THE FIFTIES WHEN. OF FEMALES WERE NOT SERVING IN THE NATIONAL GUARD FOR THE MOST PART ONE NOW THEY ARE -- AND MOST OF THESE ARE SOLDIERS -- THEIR FIELD UNITS. MANY OF THOSE ARMORIES HAVE NO FEMALE RESTROOMS ARE CHANGING FACILITY. SO WHEN WE A SURPLUS ARMORIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HISTORICALLY WE HAVE TOLD THEM THAT SOME PRICE OF THE STATUTE SAYS MARKET PRICE BUT WE KNOW THAT'S NOT THE CASE. THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES AND MILITARY DEPARTMENT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FINANCIAL. CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE LOCAL ENTITY THAT TRYING TO ACQUIRE THEM. AND MANY OF THEM ARE NOT IN SANTA BARBARA -- BROLLY COMES TO MIND IT'S THAT ARE SIMILARLY SITUATED I'M SURE THE CITY OF RIDLEY. SO WHEN THESE ARMORIES ARE SOLD THE PROCEEDS ARE PUT INTO WHAT'S CALLED AN ARMORY FUND AND AN ARMORY FUND IS USED. WITH OTHER FUNDS. TO REMODEL THESE ARMORIES AROUND THE STATE AND IT'S ABOUT A FOUR FIVE MILLION DOLLAR TAB -- REMODEL GIVE OR TAKE [inaudible] THE THERE'S SOME SPLITTING OF THE ARMORY COST WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STATE AND FEDS BUT I'M CONCERNED IF WE STARTA PRACTICE OF OF NOT CAPTURING AT LEAST SOME. THE MONEY OUT OF THE DISPOSITION OF OUR WORRIES THAT WE MAY. INTERFERE WITH OUR ABILITY TO REMODEL THE ARMORIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY UTILIZED BY ARE CURRENTLY SERVING. MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM. NOT TO DIMINISH THE NEED THAT WE HAVE TO SUPPORT VETERANS BUT WE NEED TO BALANCE. BUT WE DO SO THAT WE ARE PROVIDING SERVICES FRANK TO BOTH. COMPONENTS SO HAVING SAID ALL THAT I'VE MADE THE MOTION AND FIRMLY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. I NOTED THE AMENDMENTS PROVIDE OF TRANSFERRED TO THE CITY OF RIDLEY AFTER FIVE YEARS. EARLY AT NO COST. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT. AND NEGOTIATED THE PRICE DOWN TO WAS SOMEWHERE AROUND THE ARMORY IF I'M WRONG MAYBE BECAUSE I'M NOT THE NEGOTIATIONS -- AND MAYBE THAT'S TOO MUCH AND I UNDERSTAND SMALL CITIES ARE FINANCIALLY CHALLENGED ACTUALLY ALL CITIES ARE FINANCIALLY CHALLENGED IN THE STATE LARGELY DUE TO WHAT WE DO HOME UP HERE. BUT HAVING SAID THAT IF WE ARE GOING TO START PRACTICE. I'M ASKING THE AUTHOR TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. THEN MAYBE AS PART OF THIS WE SHOULD DEFINE A HARDSHIP STANDARD THAT WE CAN APPLY TO SMALL. A RURAL COMMUNITIES SO WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH THESE REQUESTS ON A PIECEMEAL BASIS BECAUSE WE WILL GET MORE. BUT RATHER WE'RE DEALING WITH THEM ON A ON THE ON THE SAME BASIS ONCE WE APPLY CENTER HARDSHIPS STANDARD AND THEN APPLY TO MUNICIPALITIES IT'S SIMPLY CANNOT PAY. PERHAPS ANYTHING FOR THE ARMORY. THEY BADLY NEED IN ORDER THIS BOARD ARE VOTE. SO WHAT CENTER THAT'S MY SEAT THE REQUESTED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT I REITERATE MY REITERATE MY MOTION TO STRUCTURE THANK YOU FOR YOUR THANK YOU FOR YOUR MOTION. AND YOUR COMMENT [inaudible] SENATOR. NOT THE AUTHORITY OF MY COLLEAGUE. BUT I HAVE REPRESENTED MANY. ARMOR. AND PUTTING ONE NEARLY NEXT DOOR. MY COLLEAGUE THE AUTHOR. AND I CAME HOME TOWN. THERE IS THE ARMY THERE. TO I DON'T KNOW WHAT STATUS SENATOR BUT I'M. THEY'VE BEEN STRUGGLING AND THEY HAVE BEEN IN MY OPINION. THIS BILL DECADE. THEY HAVE. NOT WITHSTANDING THE SUPPORT OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND LOCAL NEWS AND VETERANS ORGANIZATIONS. KEEP THEM UP. SO IT IS A CHALLENGE AND I CERTAINLY WILL ATTEST. THE THE MAYOR. THE MANAGER THE MANAGERS OF COMMENTS ABOUT COMMUNITY AND AND THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE VALLEY RIGHT NOW. AND IT DOES SERVE A NOBLE. ORDER SUPPORTING THE BILL. VERY GOOD THANK YOU. LET ME GIVE YOU MY COMMENTS. BUT ONE CHAU SORRY. YES SENATOR. AND AS THE ONLY FEMALE VETERAN SERVING ON THE STATE SENATE ALL RIGHT ON THE AUTHOR I MEAN WE NEED -- WE SHARE KERN COUNTY SIDE THAT -- ON THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION OF THE SPRING IT TODAY. I DID HAVE ONE QUESTION BECAUSE I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE HOW IT TRANSITIONS AND IF IT GOES FROM THE STATE RIGHT NOW THE STATE DOESN'T ANY. TAXES RIGHT ON THE PROPERTY IF IT GOES TO AND THE VETERANS COMMUNITY DOES IT. DEBATE IN YOU GUYS ARE GONNA FIGURE THAT OUT. I BELIEVE IN THE BILL IS THE PROPERTY TRANSFER OKAY WE WE GET FROM THE FANS BURKE. BUT WE WOULD THEN. LISA THE CENTRALLY AT NO COST TO THE RIVER AREA BATS THEY HAVE DEALT WITH THIS ARMORY SO WELL OVER THE PAST DECADE WE DON'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN THEIR BUSINESS THERE THEY'VE BEEN DOING THERE. VERY WELL GREAT OKAY I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT THE TAX STRUCTURE I WASN'T SURE IF THAT HAD BEEN ADDRESSED AND SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE ADDRESS THAT. SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER GROW YES ONE MORE POINT ON THAT IN AND IT. THIS BILL MAY NOT BE THE TARGET OF OPPORTUNITY TO DO THE THINGS THAT. MIGHT. ALEXANDER OFFICE TO GASP WHICH NEED TO BE DONE. IT MAY OR MAY NOT BE THE WE HAVE HOPE IS THIS MAY REQUIRE A LITTLE BIT A STUDY. CERTAINLY THE CRITERIA MAYBE FOR A OF FRESH COMMUNITY OR OR A HARDSHIP CIRCUMSTANCE. BUT MAYBE JUST SOME NON PRESIDENTIAL LANGUAGE COULD BE INSERTED HERE. IN IN THE BILL THIS IS NOT A PRECEDENT OBLIGING. FUTURE DECISION WHICH WE CAN'T DO ANYWAY. BUT THAT OFTEN IS PUT IN BILLS INCLUDING ONE THIS VERY DAY IN ANOTHER COMMITTEE FOR ANOTHER PURPOSE BUT NOT NOT PRESIDENTIAL THAT MIGHT HAMPER WE'RE NOT. OBLIGING ANYBODY IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU IF I MAY COMMENT. I I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT I THINK -- EVERY EVERY BILL -- IS AN INDIVIDUAL -- IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION THIS IS AN INDIVIDUAL -- SITUATION. WHERE WE WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT THAT VETERANS SHOULD YOUR COMMUNITY IN YOUR CITY? I'VE WORKED SO HARD OVER THE YEARS TO COME BACK AND SERVE OUR GREAT COUNTRY. AND THIS IS OUR WAY OF SAYING THANK YOU OBVIOUSLY. BUT WITH THAT THANK YOU COMES CONDITION THAT CONDITION AS THAT YOU MAINTAIN IT. FIVE YEARS YOU IMPROVE IT TO MAINTAIN IT AND IT IS ALWAYS TO BE FOR THE USE OF VETERANS. THE PURPOSE OF VETERANS -- AND NOT NECESSARILY GIVEN TO THE AMERICAN LEGION OR THAT THEY WERE THE GI FORM THE V. F. W. OR ANY PARTICULAR ENTITY. BUT IT IS SOLELY FOR THE UMBRELLA OF ALL BETTER. AND REGARDLESS OF BRANCHES OF SERVICE. THE ARMY THE NAVY THE AIRFORCE RECORD THE COAST GUARD EMERGING BRAINS TO BE TREATED FAIRLY AND EQUITABLY WOMEN. WHO SERVED OUR GREAT COUNTRY? SO I A A POINT THIS OUT TO YOU CITY MANAGER. THAT YOU HAVE THAT RESPONSIBILITY. THAT IT DOESN'T BELONG TO ONE UNIT BLOCKS ALL UNIT DOESN'T BELONG -- TO ONE PARTICULAR ENTITY IN YOUR COMMUNITY. ALL THE COMMUNITY THIS IS VERY VERY UNUSUAL THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO KNOWLEDGE JUST GIVE YOU. THE USE FOR THE FIVE YEARS. AND THEN TO COME BACK AND SAY IF YOU MET THOSE OBLIGATIONS THEN IT WILL GO TO YOUR CITY -- TO BE VERY CAREFUL. pYOUR OWN CITY. IN REFERENCE TO THE CONDITION TO USE THE THE MAINTENANCE. THE EXTERIOR THE INTERIOR -- AS WE HAD MENTIONED THE AIR CONDITIONING HEATING AND SHOW ON SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. AND ANYTIME A BETTER NEEDS HELP IT SHOULD COME RIGHT TO THAT VETERANS RESOURCE CENTER. AND I THINK THAT SHOULD BE THE VETERANS RESOURCE CENTER OF YOUR CITY. AND THE KNOWLEDGE IT WITH PRIDE BECAUSE IT IS REFLECTIVE OF THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVED IN YOUR GREAT CITY SO WITH THAT. SENATOR COULD NOT -- I WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU DUING THIS STANDING UP FOR YOUR COMMUNITY AS YOU HAVE. AND I'LL GO AHEAD AND LET YOU CLOSE.
