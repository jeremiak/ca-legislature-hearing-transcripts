00:54:55.792 --> 00:54:57.227

NOT QUALIFIED TO DO. AND I

00:55:05.101 --> 00:55:08.505
THINK THAT- SOME PEOPLE ASSUME

00:55:08.571 --> 00:55:10.073
THAT IT'S GOING TO BE A

00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:11.408
SEAMLESS TRANSITION FOR

00:55:11.474 --> 00:55:13.209
CHILDREN COMING OUT OF COBIT

00:55:13.276 --> 00:55:15.612
ISOLATION INTO OUR SCHOOL

00:55:15.679 --> 00:55:17.580
SYSTEMS BUT YESTERDAY I HEARD A

00:55:17.647 --> 00:55:19.382
STORY FROM ONE OF THE STUDENTS

00:55:19.449 --> 00:55:21.518
AND THAT IS THAT THIS LITTLE

00:55:21.584 --> 00:55:23.620
GIRL HAD BEEN PLAYING BY

00:55:23.687 --> 00:55:25.955
HERSELF OUT IN THE PLAYGROUND

00:55:26.022 --> 00:55:27.290
EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE BACK EVEN

00:55:27.357 --> 00:55:28.224
THOUGH OTHER THEIR PEERS ARE

00:55:28.291 --> 00:55:31.061
BACK. BUT SHE STILL HAS THE

00:55:31.127 --> 00:55:33.463
TRAUMA OF FEELING THAT IF SHE

00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:36.433
PLAYS WITH KIDS TEXAS KIDS THAT

00:55:36.499 --> 00:55:38.802
HER LIFE IS IN DANGER SO THAT

00:55:38.868 --> 00:55:41.571
REALLY OPENED MY EYES AS TO HOW

00:55:41.638 --> 00:55:44.641
DEEP ROOTED THE TRAUMA IS GOING

00:55:44.708 --> 00:55:46.209
TO BE EVEN AFTER THEY COME BACK

00:55:46.276 --> 00:55:48.111
AND WE ASSUME THAT IT'S QUOTE

00:55:48.178 --> 00:55:49.713
UNQUOTE NORMAL BUT THEY'RE

LEGISLATION- IS ONE STEP MOVING

01:00:38.735 --> 01:00:41.104
AWAY FROM THE FAILED WAR ON

01:00:41.170 --> 01:00:44.974
DRUGS. THE WAR ON DRUGS HAS

01:00:45.041 --> 01:00:48.077
BEEN ABJECT FAILURE. BECAUSE IT

01:00:48.144 --> 01:00:49.779
IS BASED ON THE FALSE BELIEF

01:00:49.846 --> 01:00:51.581
THE FALSE NOTION THAT

01:00:51.647 --> 01:00:54.250
CRIMINALIZING PEOPLE ARRESTING-

01:00:54.317 --> 01:00:56.152
INCARCERATING THEM FOR

01:00:56.219 --> 01:00:58.554
POSSESSING FOR USING DRUGS-

01:00:58.621 --> 01:01:00.156
WILL SOMEHOW DETER USE THAT

01:01:00.223 --> 01:01:01.991
IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY IT HAS

01:01:02.058 --> 01:01:04.260
DONE NEITHER I AND SAID WE HAVE

01:01:04.327 --> 01:01:06.829
SPEND TRILLIONS IN THE LAST

01:01:06.896 --> 01:01:07.397
HALF CENTURY ON THE WAR ON

01:01:07.463 --> 01:01:09.399
DRUGS. MORE PEOPLE ARE USING

01:01:09.465 --> 01:01:11.367
DRUGS NOW- THERE'S MORE

01:01:11.434 --> 01:01:13.636
ADDICTION THERE ARE MORE-

01:01:13.703 --> 01:01:15.338
OVERDOSES SOME TALKING ABOUT

01:01:15.405 --> 01:01:18.274
DRUGS AND GENERALLY NOT.

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:21.110
PSYCHEDELICS AND- BUT WE HAVE

01:01:21.177 --> 01:01:25.415
BUSTED TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND WE

01:01:25.481 --> 01:01:26.182
NEED TO MOVE TOWARDS A MORE

01:01:26.249 --> 01:01:29.352
HEALTH BASED APPROACH I AM

01:01:29.419 --> 01:01:30.953
BRINGING SB FIVE NINETEEN

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:33.256
BEFORE YOU TODAY COLLEAGUES

01:01:33.322 --> 01:01:34.490
BECAUSE WE NEED TO CHANGE OUR

01:01:34.557 --> 01:01:36.826
RESPONSE TO SUBSTANCE USE AND

01:01:36.893 --> 01:01:37.760
BECAUSE THESE PSYCHEDELIC

01:01:37.827 --> 01:01:40.430
SUBSTANCES ARE ALREADY BEING

01:01:40.496 --> 01:01:44.534
USED TODAY BY CALIFORNIANS FOR

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:47.270
THEIR HEALING POTENTIAL- AND

01:01:47.336 --> 01:01:49.572
MICHAEL AND OTHERWISE THEY'RE

01:01:49.639 --> 01:01:50.073
BEING USED TODAY I THINK

01:01:50.139 --> 01:01:51.707
SOMETIMES PEOPLE HEAR ABOUT

01:01:51.774 --> 01:01:53.543
DECRIMINALIZATION AND THEY

01:01:53.609 --> 01:01:54.477
THINK IT'S GOING TO SOMEHOW

01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:56.446
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE TO USE

01:01:56.512 --> 01:01:58.981
STRUCTURE INCREASE DRUG USE OR

01:01:59.048 --> 01:02:00.817
MAKE DRUGS MORE ATTRACTIVE-

01:02:00.883 --> 01:02:03.853
THAT IS NOT TRUE- THERE'S NO

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:06.122
EVIDENCE. FOR THAT- WE KNOW

01:02:06.189 --> 01:02:08.124
THAT BANNING AND CRIMINALIZING

01:02:08.191 --> 01:02:10.059
AND TAKING A CARCERAL APPROACH

01:02:10.126 --> 01:02:11.794
TO DRUGS PEOPLE STILL USE THAT

01:02:11.861 --> 01:02:13.830
THEY STILL USE IT A LOT I SAW

01:02:13.896 --> 01:02:17.967
THE QUESTION BEFORE US TODAY.

01:02:18.034 --> 01:02:18.935
WHATEVER ONE'S VIEWS. AB THIS

01:02:19.001 --> 01:02:21.270
ABOUT SITE- THIS ABOUT DRUGS.

01:02:21.337 --> 01:02:23.539
THE QUESTION BEFORE US TODAY IT

01:02:23.606 --> 01:02:25.374
SHOULD BE CONTINUED TO ARREST

01:02:25.441 --> 01:02:27.176
AND INCARCERATE PEOPLE FOR

01:02:27.243 --> 01:02:29.645
POSSESSING AND USING THESE

01:02:29.712 --> 01:02:31.581
DRUGS- WHATEVER ONE THINKS OF A

01:02:31.647 --> 01:02:33.116
PARTICULAR SUBSTANTIVE IF YOU

01:02:33.182 --> 01:02:35.284
LIKE IT OR DON'T LIKE IT OR- OR

01:02:35.351 --> 01:02:36.185
THINK IT'S A PROBLEM OR NOT A

01:02:36.252 --> 01:02:37.820
PROBLEM. THAT'S THE QUESTION

01:02:37.887 --> 01:02:39.288
SHOULD WE BE ARRESTING AND

01:02:39.355 --> 01:02:41.457
INCARCERATING PEOPLE FOR HAVING

01:02:41.524 --> 01:02:43.025
FOR POSSESSING DRUGS THIS BILL

01:02:43.092 --> 01:02:44.894
DOES NOT DECRIMINALIZE SELLING.

01:02:44.961 --> 01:02:48.197
IT'S ABOUT POSSESSION AND USE.

01:02:48.264 --> 01:02:50.032
AND SO IT'S TIME TO BRING THIS

01:02:50.099 --> 01:02:51.801
YEAR'S INTO THE LIGHT SO WE CAN

01:02:51.868 --> 01:02:52.602
HAVE A MORE SENSIBLE

01:02:52.668 --> 01:02:55.438
CONVERSATION ABOUT C. FOR USE.

01:02:55.505 --> 01:02:56.973
OF THE PSYCHEDELICS AND DISPEL

01:02:57.039 --> 01:03:00.409
MYTHS. ABOUT DECRIMINALIZATION

01:03:00.476 --> 01:03:01.811
IN RECENT YEARS AND WE AND

01:03:01.878 --> 01:03:03.713
CALIFORNIA IS NOT- WE'RE NOT

01:03:03.779 --> 01:03:05.548
THE FIRST YEAR. IN RECENT YEARS

01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:06.782
VARIOUS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:03:06.849 --> 01:03:08.918
HAVING KNOWLEDGE THAT THE CREW

01:03:08.985 --> 01:03:11.320
THAT CRIMINALIZATION- DOES NOT

01:03:11.387 --> 01:03:12.989
WORK IN MANY CITIES INCLUDING

01:03:13.055 --> 01:03:15.258

MR CHAIRMAN- SO FIRST I WANT TO

01:31:36.324 --> 01:31:37.992
START OFF BY THANKING FOR THE

01:31:38.059 --> 01:31:40.294
ON THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING AN

01:31:40.361 --> 01:31:42.563
INTEREST IN FINDING ALTERNATIVE-

01:31:42.630 --> 01:31:44.732
METHODS TO TREAT SOME OF THESE

01:31:44.799 --> 01:31:46.968
AILMENTS THAT WE HAVE YET TO BE

01:31:47.034 --> 01:31:50.271
ABLE TO CONQUER- BUT I. I HAVE

01:31:50.338 --> 01:31:52.139
SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT SOME OF

01:31:52.206 --> 01:31:54.275
THE DRUGS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING

01:31:54.342 --> 01:31:56.811
TO DECRIMINALIZE SPECIFICALLY-

01:31:56.878 --> 01:32:00.481
THE DRUG KADAM MEANS- CAN MEAN

01:32:00.548 --> 01:32:02.984
IS ONE OF THE THREE MAJOR.

01:32:03.050 --> 01:32:06.454
DRUGS USED AS A DATE RAPE DRUG.

01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:09.323
AND I HAVE GREAT CONCERN THAT

01:32:09.390 --> 01:32:11.325
THIS BILL WOULD LEGALIZE THE

01:32:11.392 --> 01:32:13.995
POSSESSION OF A DATE RAPE DRUG

01:32:14.061 --> 01:32:16.631
JUST IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN-

01:32:16.697 --> 01:32:17.899
OUR FORMER COLLEAGUE SENATOR

01:32:17.965 --> 01:32:20.568
GALGIANI HAD A BILL. PRESENTED

01:32:20.635 --> 01:32:21.535
PASSED AND SIGNED BY THE

01:32:21.602 --> 01:32:23.671
GOVERNOR THAT WOULD- MAKE IT A

01:32:23.738 --> 01:32:25.606
CRIME TO HAVE THAT DRUG FOR

01:32:25.673 --> 01:32:28.409
OBVIOUS REASONS. AND SAID THIS

01:32:28.476 --> 01:32:29.644
BILL SEEMS TO WORK IN

01:32:29.710 --> 01:32:34.815
CONTRADICTION TO THAT EFFORT- I

01:32:34.882 --> 01:32:38.853
UNDERSTAND THAT CAN MEAN. THE

01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:42.623
IN SOME FORMS IS BEING USED ON

01:32:42.690 --> 01:32:46.294
TO TREAT DEPRESSION- THAT YOU

01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:48.863
KNOW IS NOT ABLE TO BE TREATED

01:32:48.930 --> 01:32:51.465
BY OTHER MEANS. THE HERE

01:32:51.532 --> 01:32:53.334
THERE'S SOME IT'S JUST STUBBORN

01:32:53.401 --> 01:32:55.436
AND THE PERSON QUITE CAN'T GET

01:32:55.503 --> 01:32:58.439
BEYOND IT SO THERE'S- SOME

01:32:58.506 --> 01:32:59.840
CLINICAL TRIALS AND TESTING

01:32:59.907 --> 01:33:02.043
TAKING PLACE IN SEEING IF CAN I

01:33:02.109 --> 01:33:03.811
MEAN CAN BE USEFUL IN TREATING

01:33:03.878 --> 01:33:05.713
SEVERE DEPRESSION DEPRESSION

01:33:05.780 --> 01:33:09.450
THAT HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO- HAVE

01:33:09.517 --> 01:33:11.886
BEEN TREATED BY OTHER DRUGS. IN

01:33:11.953 --> 01:33:14.155
AN PTSD SORRY RECOGNIZE THAT

01:33:14.221 --> 01:33:17.325
THERE MAY BE- SOME CLINICAL

01:33:17.391 --> 01:33:19.160
BENEFITS TO USING THIS DRUG FOR

01:33:19.226 --> 01:33:24.765
DEPRESSION. HOWEVER I'M- WHEN

01:33:24.832 --> 01:33:27.568
CAN I MEAN IS USED TO TREAT

01:33:27.635 --> 01:33:29.570
DEPRESSION OR PTSD IT IS USED

01:33:29.637 --> 01:33:31.539
IN A CLINICAL SETTING SO

01:33:31.605 --> 01:33:34.308
THERE'S TWO FORMS- THERE'S AN

01:33:34.375 --> 01:33:36.143
INTRAVENOUS FORM AND THEN

01:33:36.210 --> 01:33:38.546
THERE'S A NASAL SPRAY BOTH OF

01:33:38.612 --> 01:33:40.081
WHICH HAVE TO BE USED IN A

01:33:40.147 --> 01:33:41.582
MEDICAL SETTING UNDER MEDICAL

01:33:41.649 --> 01:33:44.385
SUPERVISION- IT'S NOT SOMETHING

01:33:44.452 --> 01:33:45.486
THAT A DOCTOR PRESCRIBES AND

01:33:45.553 --> 01:33:47.088
HANDS OVER TO A PATIENT IT'S

01:33:47.154 --> 01:33:49.323
SOMETHING THAT MUST BE DONE IN

01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:51.625
A MEDICAL SETTING. SO IT'S

01:33:51.692 --> 01:33:53.494
UNCLEAR TO ME HOW SOMEONE

01:33:53.561 --> 01:33:58.132
HAVING A- SMALL AMOUNT OF THIS

01:33:58.199 --> 01:34:01.969
TYPE OF A DRUG. ON THEIR PERSON

01:34:02.036 --> 01:34:03.504
COULD BE IT COULD POSSIBLY BE

01:34:03.571 --> 01:34:05.072
USED FOR TREATING DEPRESSION OR

01:34:05.139 --> 01:34:07.041
PTSD BECAUSE THAT'S CURRENTLY

01:34:07.108 --> 01:34:09.210
NOT HOW IT'S BEING ADMINISTERED

01:34:09.276 --> 01:34:10.544
FOR THE TREATMENT OF THESE

01:34:10.611 --> 01:34:12.146
TYPES OF AILMENTS SO I WONDER

01:34:12.213 --> 01:34:15.282

01:34:36.670 --> 01:34:39.273
EXCEPTIONALLY SERIOUS. CRIME AS

01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:41.809

01:34:41.876 --> 01:34:46.013
IMPORTANT TO. ACKNOWLEDGE THAT.

01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:47.681

QUORUM COURT DATE RAPE DRUGS

01:34:49.450 --> 01:34:52.820
FIRST OF ALL. THE MOST COMMON

01:34:52.887 --> 01:34:53.454
DATE RAPE DRUG IS A DRUG CALLED

01:34:53.521 --> 01:34:56.557

01:34:56.624 --> 01:34:58.459
WHICH IS NOT PART OF THIS BILL

01:34:58.526 --> 01:35:01.462
AND THEN THERE ON IS- REFORM

01:35:01.529 --> 01:35:04.265
CALLED FOR RUPEES. RIGHT SO ON

01:35:04.331 --> 01:35:05.833
AND SO THERE ARE VARIOUS

01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:08.903
SUBSTANCES THAT CAN BE USED IN

01:35:08.969 --> 01:35:11.372
A REALLY. YOU KNOW AT THE END

01:35:11.439 --> 01:35:12.139
OF SOMEONE'S ASSAULTING SOMEONE

01:35:12.206 --> 01:35:14.108
ELSE. SLIPPING SOMEONE IN THEIR

01:35:15.876 --> 01:35:17.711
INTOXICATED ON ALCOHOL AND THEN

01:35:17.778 --> 01:35:19.547
DO SOMETHING HORRIBLE- AND

01:35:19.613 --> 01:35:22.049
THEY- SHOULD BE PROSECUTED AND

01:35:22.116 --> 01:35:23.984
THE STILL DESIGN ANYWAY. STOP

01:35:24.051 --> 01:35:27.021
THAT FROM HAPPENING- AND BUT

01:35:27.088 --> 01:35:28.622

A ROW. FOR POSSESSING THE DRUG.

01:35:38.199 --> 01:35:39.800

BILL SIMPLY SAYS. FOR THIS

01:46:18.538 --> 01:46:21.241

01:46:37.891 --> 01:46:39.426
QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR

01:46:39.493 --> 01:46:41.928
BECAUSE- IT I AM. SEEING HERE

01:46:41.995 --> 01:46:45.065
THAT IT'S IT SAYS- THE BILL

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS. ON

01:46:49.236 --> 01:46:50.270
THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY

01:46:50.337 --> 01:46:52.038
IMPLICATIONS OF DECRIMINALIZING

01:46:52.105 --> 01:46:53.907
THESE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES AND

01:46:53.974 --> 01:46:55.609
IDENTIFICATION OF REGULATED USE

01:46:55.675 --> 01:46:58.178
MODELS FROM OTHER JURISDICTIONS

01:46:58.245 --> 01:47:00.781
BY THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY FOUR.

01:47:00.847 --> 01:47:03.917
AND I AM- I GUESS WONDERING WHY

01:47:03.984 --> 01:47:05.619
THAT WOULD GO INTO EFFECT TWO

01:47:05.685 --> 01:47:08.588
YEARS AFTER. THIS LAW WOULD GO

01:47:08.655 --> 01:47:10.590
INTO EFFECT WHY WOULD WHY WOULD

01:47:10.657 --> 01:47:13.527
WE COMMISSION A STUDY ON DOING

01:47:13.593 --> 01:47:16.463
THE VERY THING THAT. THIS BILL

01:47:16.530 --> 01:47:20.000
SEEKS TO DO IT. SENATE WIENER I

01:47:20.066 --> 01:47:22.002
THANK YOU MR SO THE PURPOSE OF

01:47:22.068 --> 01:47:23.370
THE WORKING GROUP IS NOT TO

01:47:23.436 --> 01:47:24.304
GIVE AN OPINION ABOUT WHETHER

01:47:24.371 --> 01:47:25.872
WE SHOULD DECRIMINALIZE THE

01:47:25.939 --> 01:47:27.541
PURPOSE OF THE WORKING GROUP'S

01:47:27.607 --> 01:47:28.675
THE SECOND ONCE WE HAVE

01:47:28.742 --> 01:47:30.143
STOPPED. ARRESTING AND

01:47:30.210 --> 01:47:32.045
PROSECUTING FOR PEOPLE FOR

01:47:32.112 --> 01:47:34.181
POSSESSING THE SUBSTANCES. WHAT

01:47:34.247 --> 01:47:35.415
CAN WE THINK ABOUT IN THE

01:47:35.482 --> 01:47:38.485
FUTURE IN TERMS OF POTENTIAL.

01:47:38.552 --> 01:47:40.921
REGULATION YOU RECALL THAT WITH

01:47:40.987 --> 01:47:43.256
FOR EXAMPLE CANNABIS. WE DID IT

01:47:43.323 --> 01:47:44.858
IN TWO STEPS FIRST THE VOTERS

01:47:44.925 --> 01:47:46.726
STEPPED IN AND SAID THEY WERE.

01:47:46.793 --> 01:47:48.995
GOING TO DECRIMINALIZE-

01:47:49.062 --> 01:47:51.531
MEDICINAL CANNABIS- HONESTLY

01:47:51.598 --> 01:47:52.766
THAT WAS EFFECTIVELY

01:47:52.833 --> 01:47:54.000
DECRIMINALIZATION IN THE STATE

01:47:54.067 --> 01:47:56.736
OF CALIFORNIA. AND THEN TWENTY

01:47:56.803 --> 01:47:59.372
YEARS LATER- THE VOTERS PASSED

01:47:59.439 --> 01:48:01.041
ON THE ADULT USE MORE

01:48:01.107 --> 01:48:05.011
REGULATORY- OUR SYSTEM IS A TWO

01:48:05.078 --> 01:48:06.479
SEPARATE THINGS. AND SO THE

01:48:06.546 --> 01:48:08.782
PURPOSE OF TASK FORCES THAT

01:48:08.849 --> 01:48:10.550
OKAY NOW WE'VE DECRIMINALIZED.

01:48:10.617 --> 01:48:13.153
STOPPED ARRESTING PEOPLE- WHY

01:48:13.220 --> 01:48:15.021
DO WE DO IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE

01:48:15.088 --> 01:48:16.590
THAT IS FRANKLY EVEN THAT'S

01:48:16.656 --> 01:48:18.525
MORE COMPLICATED- IN TERMS OF

01:48:18.592 --> 01:48:21.027
POTENTIAL REGULATION- THERE ARE

01:48:21.094 --> 01:48:22.229
ACTIVE THE DATES RIGHT NOW

01:48:22.295 --> 01:48:24.097
ABOUT COMMERCIALIZATION. AS

01:48:24.164 --> 01:48:25.365
THERE ARE WITH FRANKLY WITH

01:48:25.432 --> 01:48:28.001
WITH CANNABIS- AND SO THAT

01:48:28.068 --> 01:48:31.938
THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE- OF

01:48:32.005 --> 01:48:35.308
THE OF THE TASK FORCE. AND I HI

01:48:35.375 --> 01:48:36.977
I WAS THAT WE DON'T NEED A TASK

01:48:37.043 --> 01:48:39.946
FORCE TO TELL US THAT ARRESTING

01:48:40.013 --> 01:48:41.348
JAILING AND CRIMINALIZING

01:48:41.414 --> 01:48:42.515
PEOPLE FOR DRUG POSSESSION WE

01:48:42.582 --> 01:48:44.417
DON'T NEED A TEST FIRST TELL US

01:48:44.484 --> 01:48:47.554
ABOUT THIS AND MARK. ANY OTHER

01:48:47.621 --> 01:48:49.623
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. I DON'T

01:48:49.689 --> 01:48:51.291
SEE ANY MICROPHONES UP NO HE

01:48:51.358 --> 01:48:55.028
ENDS UP- SO CENTER WIENER- THE

01:48:55.095 --> 01:48:56.329
ESTIMATE YOU KNOW I'M NOT NOT

01:48:56.396 --> 01:48:58.098
THE MOST ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORTER

01:48:58.164 --> 01:49:01.001
OF YOUR BILL- SOMEONE WHO IS

01:49:01.067 --> 01:49:03.336
YOU KNOW CERTAINLY CONCERNED- I

01:49:03.403 --> 01:49:06.673
THINK- ABOUT- ABOUT WHAT IMPACT

01:49:06.740 --> 01:49:08.475
THESE SUBSTANCES CAN HAVE HELP

01:49:08.541 --> 01:49:10.577
AT THE SAME TIME AS YOU POINTED

01:49:10.644 --> 01:49:12.612
OUT- FIRST OF ALL THEY D. AT

01:49:12.679 --> 01:49:14.681
YOUR DATE- CRIMINALIZING IT

01:49:14.748 --> 01:49:15.548
DEFINITELY HAS A NEGATIVE

01:49:15.615 --> 01:49:17.117
IMPACT. AND IT'S INTERESTING

01:49:17.183 --> 01:49:18.318
THAT WE BROUGHT UP ALCOHOL

01:49:18.385 --> 01:49:19.986
SEVERAL TIMES BECAUSE IN THIS

01:49:20.053 --> 01:49:20.387
COUNTRY WE DID TRY

01:49:20.453 --> 01:49:22.355
CRIMINALIZING ALCOHOL. AND WITH

01:49:22.422 --> 01:49:23.556
THIS WE FIGURED OUT HOW QUICKLY

01:49:23.623 --> 01:49:25.725
HOW BADLY THAT TURNE OUT IN

01:49:25.792 --> 01:49:27.093
FACT IN WEEK I'M CRIMINALIZED

01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:29.162
ALCOHOLS- SO WE ACTUALLY TRIED

01:49:29.229 --> 01:49:30.997
THAT EXPERIMENT HERE- WE'RE

01:49:31.064 --> 01:49:32.432
DOING IT AGAIN WE'VE DONE IT

01:49:32.499 --> 01:49:33.733
AGAIN WITH OTHER SUBSTANCES

01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:36.536
INCLUDING PSYCHEDELICS- BUT

01:49:36.603 --> 01:49:38.905
ALSO NOTING THAT- WE TALK ABOUT

01:49:38.972 --> 01:49:39.873
PSYCHEDELICS AT LEAST FROM MY

01:49:39.940 --> 01:49:42.976
PERSPECTIVE- YOU KNOW THERE'D.

01:49:43.043 --> 01:49:45.779
THEY'RE NOT ADDICTIVE PER SE-

01:49:45.845 --> 01:49:47.480
SO I THINK I HAVE A TRY HAVE A

01:49:47.547 --> 01:49:48.581
SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT ATTITUDE

01:49:48.648 --> 01:49:49.516
TOWARD SOME OTHER SUBSTANCES

01:49:49.582 --> 01:49:51.251
THAT WOULD- BE MORE ADDICTIVE

01:49:51.318 --> 01:49:53.586
WHAT'S HARD FOR SOMEONE TO. TO

01:49:53.653 --> 01:49:56.289
STOP USAGE- THE AS YOU POINTED

01:49:56.356 --> 01:49:57.524
OUT THEY DO HAVE THERAPEUTIC

01:49:57.590 --> 01:49:59.693
BENEFITS. MANY OF THEM- WELL

01:49:59.759 --> 01:50:00.827
GENERALLY I WOULD SAY THOSE

01:50:00.894 --> 01:50:01.561
SHOULD BE HANDLED UNDER

01:50:01.628 --> 01:50:03.096
PRESCRIPTION I'D ALSO MAKE NOTE

01:50:03.163 --> 01:50:04.130
THAT I AGREE WITH YOU THAT JUST

01:50:04.197 --> 01:50:05.465
BECAUSE SOMEONE POSSESSING IT.

01:50:05.532 --> 01:50:07.567
SHOULDN'T BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:50:07.634 --> 01:50:09.436
SOMEONE TO GET NOW FIND

01:50:09.502 --> 01:50:10.637
THEMSELVES ENGAGE WITH LAW

01:50:10.704 --> 01:50:13.306
ENFORCEMENT. AND WITH THAT YOU

01:50:13.373 --> 01:50:14.674
KNOWI DO THINK YOU MAKES US

01:50:14.741 --> 01:50:16.376
SOME VERY COMPELLING ARGUMENTS

01:50:16.443 --> 01:50:18.211
IN TERMS OF THE LEVEL OF HARM

01:50:18.278 --> 01:50:19.879
TO OR CREATING BY CRIMINALIZING

01:50:19.946 --> 01:50:22.248
THE SUBSTANCES. A TIED IT IN WE

01:50:22.315 --> 01:50:23.450
DO NEED TO PROVISION- AND I

01:50:23.516 --> 01:50:24.384
APPRECIATE THE OPPOSITION'S

01:50:24.451 --> 01:50:27.587
TESTIMONY THAT IT'S NOT. THAT

01:50:27.654 --> 01:50:28.488
YOU KNOW WE- THAT WE DO NEED

01:50:28.555 --> 01:50:29.689
RIGHT SUPPORT FOR PEOPLE WHO

01:50:29.756 --> 01:50:32.292
MAY HAVE. NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES

01:50:32.359 --> 01:50:34.294
OR HAVE- YOU KNOW AND ACCESS

01:50:34.361 --> 01:50:36.796
TO. THE SITE AT THE SUBSTANCES

01:50:36.863 --> 01:50:38.064
THAT THAT THAN FORGING TURNED

01:50:38.131 --> 01:50:39.733
OUT BADLY- YOU KNOW THAT'S

01:50:39.799 --> 01:50:41.001
THAT'S OF ACCESS TO SUBSTANCE

01:50:41.067 --> 01:50:42.969
USE TREATMENT AND SO FORTH. BUT

01:50:43.036 --> 01:50:44.771
I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO AT

01:50:44.838 --> 01:50:47.974
LEAST- THIS PARTICULAR. SET OF-

01:50:48.041 --> 01:50:50.010
SUBSTANCES- GIVEN BOTH THEIR

01:50:50.076 --> 01:50:51.644
POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC BENEFIT

01:50:51.711 --> 01:50:54.647
AS WELL AS- I THINK THE WELL

01:50:54.714 --> 01:50:56.249
THERE'S CERTAINLY SOME RISK OF

01:50:56.316 --> 01:50:58.385
HARM THAT- I THINK THAT THAT-

01:50:58.451 --> 01:51:00.887
BUT- IT'S SOMETHING THAT- THE

01:51:00.954 --> 01:51:02.055
HARM FROM THE GLOBALIZATION

01:51:02.122 --> 01:51:03.890
THINK IT'S MUCH WORSE. SO I

01:51:03.957 --> 01:51:05.191
WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL I

01:51:05.258 --> 01:51:06.226

ISSUES LAID OUT IN THE

ANALYSIS. I DON'T WANT TO

02:07:35.681 --> 02:07:36.982
DISTRACT TOO MUCH FROM THE

02:07:37.049 --> 02:07:39.251
SCOPE OF THIS BILL WHICH IS

02:07:39.318 --> 02:07:41.453
VERY TARGETED AND SPECIFIC. BUT

02:07:41.520 --> 02:07:43.489
I JUST WANT TO BRIEFLY MENTION

02:07:43.555 --> 02:07:45.457
KIND OF THE BROADER ISSUE ON

02:07:45.524 --> 02:07:47.659
RIGHT TO REPAIR IF YOU'VE BEEN-

02:07:47.726 --> 02:07:49.561
OVERWHELMED WITH THE OPPOSITION

02:07:49.628 --> 02:07:50.396
TO THIS BILL YOU MIGHT THINK

02:07:50.462 --> 02:07:51.697
WHAT WHAT IS THIS BILL DOING

02:07:51.764 --> 02:07:52.464
THAT SO MANY PEOPLE ARE

02:07:52.531 --> 02:07:54.900
OPPOSING WELL. IT'S A LOT IT'S

02:07:54.967 --> 02:07:55.968
THIS IS A MOVEMENT THAT'S BEEN

02:07:56.035 --> 02:07:58.003
WORKING AROUND THE COUNTRY AND

02:07:58.070 --> 02:08:00.873
SO THERE'S INTEREST IN IT- A

02:08:00.939 --> 02:08:02.241
PEOPLE MAY RECALL I'VE WORKED

02:08:02.307 --> 02:08:05.344
IN THIS SPACE. FOR A WHILE AND

02:08:05.411 --> 02:08:06.478
THEN THE ISSUE IS JUST THIS

02:08:06.545 --> 02:08:09.281
WHEN. WHEN CORPORATIONS. SELL

02:08:09.348 --> 02:08:11.750
US A PRODUCT DO WE OWN IT OR DO

02:08:11.817 --> 02:08:13.485
THEY OWN IT AND IF WE OWN IT

02:08:13.552 --> 02:08:15.087
MAY WE GET IT REPAIRED. BY

02:08:15.154 --> 02:08:16.855
SOMEBODY OTHER THAN THE COMPANY

02:08:16.922 --> 02:08:18.724
WHO SOLD IT TO US. I UNDERSTAND

02:08:18.791 --> 02:08:20.059
THAT'S THEIR BUSINESS MODEL BUT

02:08:20.125 --> 02:08:21.727
WE NEED TO QUESTION I THINK

02:08:21.794 --> 02:08:23.262
THERE'S A BUSINESS MODEL WORK

02:08:23.328 --> 02:08:25.464
FOR. EVERYDAY PEOPLE. DOES IT

02:08:25.531 --> 02:08:27.332
WORK FOR IN THISCASE HOSPITALS

02:08:27.399 --> 02:08:29.201
DOES IT WORK FOR PATIENTS. AND

02:08:29.268 --> 02:08:31.270
DOESN'T WORK FOR REPAIR PEOPLE

02:08:31.336 --> 02:08:33.739
WHO ARE QUALIFIED. A LOT OF

02:08:33.806 --> 02:08:35.574
THEM SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS

02:08:35.641 --> 02:08:38.110
ENTREPRENEURS- SO THAT'S THAT'S

02:08:38.177 --> 02:08:39.011
THE QUESTION BEFORE US TODAY

02:08:39.078 --> 02:08:40.412
AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHY

02:08:40.479 --> 02:08:42.281
THERE WAS SO MUCH OPPOSITION.

02:08:42.347 --> 02:08:44.817
THAT'S WHY- EVERYONE BANDS

02:08:44.883 --> 02:08:46.051
TOGETHER TO TRY TO STOP

02:08:46.118 --> 02:08:47.352
SOMETHING THEY THINK MIGHT HURT

02:08:47.419 --> 02:08:49.321
THEIR BUSINESS MODEL- THE

02:08:49.388 --> 02:08:51.623
FUNDAMENTAL GOALS OF THE RIGHT

02:08:51.690 --> 02:08:52.458
TO REPAIR MOVEMENT ARE TO

02:08:52.524 --> 02:08:54.059
REDUCE WASTE. INCREASE

02:08:54.126 --> 02:08:55.194
COMPETITION FOR REPAIR TO

02:08:55.260 --> 02:08:57.096
SUPPORT LOCAL BUSINESSES.

02:08:57.162 --> 02:08:59.364
IMPROVE PRODUCT DURABILITY AND

02:08:59.431 --> 02:09:01.266
RESTORE WHAT IT TRULY MEANS. TO

02:09:01.333 --> 02:09:02.935
OWN OUR OWN STUFF I THINK WE

02:09:03.001 --> 02:09:05.471
CAN ALL. AGREE WITH THOSE

02:09:05.537 --> 02:09:07.406
PRINCIPLES- AND OUR

02:09:07.473 --> 02:09:09.274
CONVERSATION IS TODAY WILL THIS

02:09:09.341 --> 02:09:10.175
MOVEMENT IS HAPPENING AROUND

02:09:10.242 --> 02:09:12.344
THE COUNTRY. IT IS HOW DO WE

02:09:12.411 --> 02:09:14.079
TRANSFERRED THESE PRINCIPLES.

02:09:14.146 --> 02:09:19.151
INTO PUBLIC POLICY. AND THAT'S

02:09:19.218 --> 02:09:20.252
WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON. TODAY M.

02:09:20.319 --> 02:09:20.752
THE BILL TAKES A SIMPLE

02:09:20.819 --> 02:09:21.653
APPROACH LOOKING JUST ONE

02:09:21.720 --> 02:09:23.322
CATEGORY PRODUCTS MEDICAL

02:09:23.388 --> 02:09:25.224
DEVICES AND TRIES TO OPEN UP

02:09:25.290 --> 02:09:26.692
THE REPAIR MARKET BY ALLOWING

02:09:26.758 --> 02:09:28.794
ACCESS TO THE NEEDED PARTS

02:09:28.861 --> 02:09:30.696
TOOLS DOCUMENTATION AND

02:09:30.762 --> 02:09:32.531
SOFTWARE FOR MAINTENANCE AND

02:09:32.598 --> 02:09:34.900
REPAIR RIGHT NOW IT IS LEGAL

02:09:34.967 --> 02:09:35.434
FOR THE HOSPITAL TO REPAIR

02:09:35.501 --> 02:09:37.136
THEIR OWN EQUIPMENT OR FOR

02:09:37.202 --> 02:09:38.370
SOMEBODY THEY CONTRACT WITH TO

02:09:38.437 --> 02:09:39.872
REPAIR EQUIPMENT THAT THE

02:09:39.938 --> 02:09:41.573
HOSPITAL HAS PURCHASED THAT THE

02:09:41.640 --> 02:09:44.409
HOSPITAL OWNS. BUT SUFFERS IS

02:09:44.476 --> 02:09:47.513
PUT INTO PLACE- THE STOP AT THE

02:09:47.579 --> 02:09:49.715
REPAIRS CAN IN FACT JUST SHUT

02:09:49.781 --> 02:09:51.617
DOWN A DEVICE IF IT IS NOT

02:09:51.683 --> 02:09:54.720
REPAIRED BY THE MANUFACTURER-

02:09:54.786 --> 02:09:57.322
AND- THERE IS NOT ENOUGH ACCESS

02:09:57.389 --> 02:09:59.992
T PARTS THE TOOLS. THE

02:10:00.058 --> 02:10:02.628
DOCUMENTATION. AS OPPOSED TO BE

02:10:02.694 --> 02:10:03.495
AMENDED ACCESS TO THESE

02:10:03.562 --> 02:10:08.834
RESOURCES. SPITTLE ON THE

02:10:08.901 --> 02:10:09.468
MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR OF THEIR

02:10:09.535 --> 02:10:11.904
EQUIPMENT. REPORTING EARLY ON

02:10:11.970 --> 02:10:13.438
IN THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC I

02:10:13.505 --> 02:10:15.474
THINK HIGHLIGHTED JUST NOT JUST

02:10:15.541 --> 02:10:16.241
THE LACK OF INVESTMENT IN

02:10:16.308 --> 02:10:17.876
SUPPLY AND EQUIPMENT STOCKPILES

02:10:17.943 --> 02:10:19.912
BUT THE CHALLENGES PRESENT AND

02:10:19.978 --> 02:10:20.746
TRYING TO REPAIR MEDICAL

02:10:20.812 --> 02:10:22.247
EQUIPMENT. AND I THINK THE KEY

02:10:22.314 --> 02:10:23.549
TAKEAWAY IS THAT THIS IS NOT A

02:10:23.615 --> 02:10:25.017
PROBLEM BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC

02:10:25.083 --> 02:10:26.718
BUT IT WAS AN EXISTING PROBLEM

02:10:26.785 --> 02:10:28.687
LIKE A LOT OF THINGS MADE

02:10:28.754 --> 02:10:30.222
VISIBLE TO US BY THE PANDEMIC.

02:10:30.289 --> 02:10:31.623
HOSPITALS IN CALIFORNIA MAY

02:10:31.690 --> 02:10:33.091
EMPLOY IN HOUSE BIOMEDICAL

02:10:33.158 --> 02:10:35.260
ENGINEERS AND TAX AND THEY MAY

02:10:35.327 --> 02:10:36.361
WORK WITH INDEPENDENT SERVICE

02:10:36.428 --> 02:10:38.330

MEDICAL EQUIPMENT FOR A LIVING.

02:10:42.901 --> 02:10:43.802
STOP TO THINK ABOUT THE

02:10:43.869 --> 02:10:45.637
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES WE RUN

02:10:45.704 --> 02:10:46.471

PURPOSE OF THE BILL I LIKE THE

02:39:49.513 --> 02:39:51.682
BILL I DO I THINK IF IT'S YOUR

02:39:51.748 --> 02:39:53.083
EQUIPMENT YOU CAN REPAIR IT OR

02:39:53.150 --> 02:39:54.217
HAVE SOMEBODY REPAIRED AT A

02:39:54.284 --> 02:39:57.387
LOWER COST- BY ALL MEANS DO IT.

02:39:57.454 --> 02:40:00.324
I DO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE-

02:40:00.390 --> 02:40:02.626
THE FINES AND PENALTIES- YOU

02:40:02.693 --> 02:40:03.694
KNOW A THOUSAND DOLLARS A DAY

02:40:03.760 --> 02:40:06.530
FOR- AND THEN A TWO THOUSAND

02:40:06.596 --> 02:40:07.631
DOLLARS A DAY AND THEN FIVE

02:40:07.698 --> 02:40:08.165
THOUSAND DOLLARS A DAY FOR

EVERY DAY- THAT A VIOLATION

02:40:11.969 --> 02:40:14.604
OCCURS. I THINK THAT- I THINK

02:40:14.671 --> 02:40:18.542
THAT'S A LOT. AND I MEAN A LOT

02:40:18.608 --> 02:40:19.943

02:40:20.010 --> 02:40:21.678
TO HOLD- MANUFACTURERS AND

02:40:21.745 --> 02:40:22.913
PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE BUT I JUST

02:40:22.980 --> 02:40:24.748
THINK THAT THE CONTINUING

02:40:24.815 --> 02:40:28.385
DOLLAR AMOUNT AND JESS DRIVES A

02:40:28.452 --> 02:40:30.654
LITIGATION AND ATTORNEYS TO BE

02:40:30.721 --> 02:40:32.789

02:40:32.856 --> 02:40:33.957
BETTER WAY TO HANDLE THAT BT I

02:40:34.024 --> 02:40:35.625
DO WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I DO I

02:40:35.692 --> 02:40:37.461
LIKE WHAT YOU'RE DOING I REALLY

02:40:37.527 --> 02:40:38.962
DO BECAUSE I HAVE CONSTITUENTS

02:40:39.029 --> 02:40:40.030
THAT HAVE THE SAME ISSUES

02:40:40.097 --> 02:40:41.398
DURING THE PANDEMIC WE LEARN

02:40:41.465 --> 02:40:42.499
THAT. PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO

02:40:42.566 --> 02:40:44.634
REPAIR AND THEIR OWN EQUIPMENT

02:40:44.701 --> 02:40:47.170

YOU FOR WORKING WITH MY STAFF-

02:44:32.529 --> 02:44:33.797
WE DID NARROW THE BILL TO

02:44:33.863 --> 02:44:34.898
HOSPITALS BECAUSE THERE IS THAT

02:44:34.965 --> 02:44:36.800
ACCOUNTABILITY THE HOSPITAL HAS

02:44:36.866 --> 02:44:40.036
TO REPORT. TO CMS- WE WANT TO

02:44:40.103 --> 02:44:41.938
BE SURE WE HAD THAT ELEMENT OF.

02:44:42.005 --> 02:44:44.140
SAFETY WITH IT IS NOT JUST SOME

02:44:44.207 --> 02:44:45.542
RANDOM PERSON BE ABLE TO

ANALYSIS I THINK IT'S PRETTY

02:44:56.219 --> 02:44:57.887
CLEAR SAYING THE FINES APPLY IF

02:44:57.954 --> 02:44:59.122
THEY'RE INTENTIONALLY VIOLATING

02:44:59.189 --> 02:45:01.157
THIS LAW I THINK IF. THE PEOPLE

02:45:01.224 --> 02:45:02.726

02:45:02.792 --> 02:45:04.094

PEOPLE DOWN WE'RE NOT TRYING TO

02:45:05.562 --> 02:45:08.265
PLAY GOTCHA. I THINK- DO WE BUT

02:45:08.331 --> 02:45:08.999
THERE NEEDS TO BE ENFORCEMENT

02:45:09.065 --> 02:45:12.402
MECHANISM- AND- YEAH. I THINK

02:45:12.469 --> 02:45:14.237
IT'S AND AGAIN WE'RE WE'RE WE

02:45:14.304 --> 02:45:15.438
