NOW THAT WE HAVE GONE OVER THE LOGISTICS OF TODAY'S HEARING I WANT TO WELCOME OUR WITNESSES TO THE HEARING AND THANK THEM FOR. COMING BEFORE THE COMMITTEE TO DISCUSS HOW CALIFRNIA SHOULD RESPOND TO THE DROUGHT. WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR SECOND DRY YEAR IN A ROW. AND ON TRACK TO SEE OUR FOURTH DRIEST YEAR ON RECORD. SILVA DEJA VU AND I'M SURE YOU ALL WOULD AGREE. WE JUST CAME OUT OF OUR LAST DROP INTO THOSE SEVENTEEN. CALIFORNIA'S MORE SEVERE. DROP ON RECORD AND HERE WE ARE AGAIN. WE ALL AGREE THAT WATER IS ESSENTIAL FOR PUBLIC CAL TO MEET BASIC NEEDS TO DRIVE OUR ECONOMY TO SENATOR VERSE THAT TO RESOURCES. WHEN DROUGHT OCCURS EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING IS ADVERSELY AFFECTED. THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE TO SIXTEEN DROUGHT EXPOSED CHALLENGES. IN MEETING OUR PROMISE TO ENSURE ACCESS TO SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS HAD CRIPPLING EFFECTS ON AGRICULTURAL SECTOR. IT DRIED UP RIVERS AND THAT IN TURN ADVERSELY IMPACTED OUR COMMERCIAL FISHERIES AND FINALLY EXACERBATED WILD. FIRE SEASON IMPERATIVE THAT WE DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN RESPOND TO AND MITIGATE THESE DROUGHT CONDITIONS. THERE'S TOO MUCH AT STAKE NOT TO TAKE ACTION I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR PARTICIPATING IN THIS IMPORTANT DISCUSSION I WANT TO HEAR ABOUT WHAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM THE LAST DROUGHT. AND WHAT WE ARE DOING RIGHT NOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO THIS SUMMER NEXT YEAR AND BEYOND TO BECOME MORE DROUGHT RESILIENT. WE HAVE A HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY WITH THE BUDGET SURPLUS IMPENDING BOND PROPOSALS. TO MAKE DOWN PAYMENTS TO ALLEVIATE THE IMPACTS OF FUTURE DROUGHTS LET'S TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT SO THAT WE CAN EASE THE IMPACT OF THE DROUGHT. ON ARGUMENT COMMUNITIES FARMS FISHERIES AND NATURAL RESOURCES WITH THAT. I'D LIKE TO ASK OUR VICE CHAIR TO SEE IF HE HAS ANY OPENING REMARKS AND THEN WE'LL MAKE INTRODUCTIONS TO OUR FIRST PANEL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M LOOKING FOR TO THE DISCUSSION TODAY I KNOW THAT WE'RE ALL CONCERNED ABOUT THE DROUGHT CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. MUCH OF MY DISTRICT IS ALREADY REELING AND READY TO. HERE WHAT WHAT OUR SOLUTIONS ARE GOING TO BE SO THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I LOOK FOR TO THE DISCUSSION. HELLO ASK IF ANY OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO SAY A FEW REMARKS BEFORE WE JUMP IN. OKAY SEE NONE. WE WILL INTRODUCE OUR FIRST PANELIST AT THREE DOLLARS. PRINCIPLE FISCAL POLICY ANALYSIS. ANALYSTS FROM THE ALLEY OF OFFICE AND SHE IS. GOING TO BE. ON OUR SCREENS I BELIEVE SO. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS RACHEL EHLERS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. I WILL BE SPEAKING FROM A HANDOUT BUT HOPEFULLY WE IS WITHIN YOUR MEMBER PACKET THAT'S CALLED HOW DID THE STATE RESPOND TO THE LAST DROUGHT. IT'S ALSO WANTS TO BE ON THE COMMITTEE WEBSITE AND IT'S ON. OUR WEBSITE AT LEÃ³N DOT CA DOT GOV FOR THE PUBLIC. AND I THINK MY TASK HERE IS TO PROVIDE A BRIEF REVIEW OF HOW THE STATE RESPONDED- DURING THE LAST DROUGHT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THAT CAN PROVIDE A LOT OF CONTEXT AS WE HEAR. THAT THE CHAIR SAID DO YOU HAVE- ALL OVER AGAIN WE FIND OURSELVES IN FACING SIMILAR CONDITIONS. SO IM PEI ONE OF THAT HAND OUT YOU KNOW DOUBTS ARE NOTHING NEW IN CALIFORNIA- WE DID AND THEY SAID BUT SIGNIFICANT DROUGHT RECENTLY- IF IT LASTED FROM TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THROUGH TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ALTHOUGH SOME MIGHT SAY IT ACTUALLY STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN. AND WE JUST HAD ONE WHEN YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THAT THAT BROKE IT UP- BUT THAT THAT DROUGHT WAS REALLY SIGNIFICANT IN A LOT OF WAYS IT WAS THAT BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE DRIEST FOUR YEAR STRETCH. ON RECORD IN CALIFORNIA CONSECUTIVE YEARS- IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WAS THE THIRD DRIEST YEAR ON RECORD. AND THOSE THOSE DRY CONDITIONS A LACK OF PRECIPITATION WE'RE REALLY COMPOUNDED BY ALSO HISTORICALLY HIGH TEMPERATURES- TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WERE RESPECTIVELY THE HIGHEST. TWO YEARS HOTTEST TWO YEARS ON RECORD IN CALIFORNIA. AND OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT WHILE I'M WARM TEMPERATURES EXACERBATING DRY CONDITIONS THEY BOTH INCREASED DEMAND FOR WATER FOR IRRIGATION FOR AGRICULTURE. AS WELL AS IN URBAN SETTINGS- AND THEY ALSO DECREASE SNOWMELT RUNOFF BECAUSE OF EVAPORATION AND DRIER SOILS THAT SOAK UP THAT WATER- SO RIGHT SO REALLY YEAH- A DIFFICULT COMBINATION OF HIGH TEMPERATURES AND- AND LACK OF PRECIPITATION. SO THE DROUGHT IMPACTED. SECTORS ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. URBAN COMMUNITIES RURAL COMMUNITIES AGRICULTURE AT A PARENT PAYMENT I KNOW THAT YOUR THIRD PANEL HAS RELEASED OTHER REPRESENTATIVES WHO WILL GO INTO THE IMPACTS FOR EACH OF THOSE SECTORS SPECIFICALLY SO I THINK I'LL SKIP OVER- TRYING TO. TRYING TO DISCUSS THOSE AND. STILL GET THOSE IN YOUR THIRD PANEL. SO TO EACH YEAR OVER HAND THAT. ADD THIS SUMMER. HOW THE SPEED STAY SPEND MY TO RESPOND TO THE LAST AS YOU CAN SEE IT WAS A TOTAL OF FOUR FOUR. DOLLARS IN STATE FUNDING THAT SPREAD ACROSS FOUR DIFFERENT YEARS. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THE BIGGEST CATEGORY THERE WAS FOR WATER SUPPLY TWO POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS AND THOSE ARE REALLY FOR A BIGGER LONGER TERM PROJECTS INTENDED TO INCREASE THE STATE'S RESILIENCE FOR FUTURE DROUGHTS THEY DIDN'T REALLY THOSE TYPE FOR BIG LONG TERM PROJECTS DON'T REALLY HELP. IN THE MIDDLE OF A DROUGHT BECAUSE THEY DO TAKE A LONG TIME TO PERMITTED TO RETAIN FINANCING TO- KIND OF GET CONSTRUCTION AND GET UNDER WAY- SO THAT THAT BIGGER CATEGORY HOPEFULLY WILL HELP US. NOW SEVERAL YEARS LATER AS WE'RE FACING ANOTHER DROUGHT BUT REALLY HAVEN'T PROBABLY DIDN'T PROVIDE TOO MUCH RELIEF IN THE MIDST OF THE LAST DROUGHT. ALL RIGHT NOW THAT'S THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE CATEGORIES YOU SEE HERE WHICH REALLY WORK SPENDING TO TRY AND ADDRESS MELIORATE- PRESSING URGENT CONDITIONS THINGS LIKE. WELLS GOING DRY EMERGENCY DRINKING WATER NEEDS DEAD AND DYING TREES THAT NEEDED TO BE REMOVED- FIRE. FIRES BREAKING OUT SO. THAT THEIR WORK AND IT SHOULD BE TO DIRECTLY. TO BEING WORSE BECAUSE OF THE DROUGHT. AND THEN WHAT I CAN. A WHICH YOU SEE THE SEND NEXT. AS WELL I THINK I'VE CHECKED CATEGORIES THEY BOTH CAN HELP REDUCE DEMAND IN RESPONSE TO IMMEDIATE PRESSING DROUGHT CONDITIONS. BUT THEN ALSO HAVE ONGOING. RESULTS AND ASSISTANCE IF THINGS LIKE REMOVING- TURF AND LAWN IN FRONT YARDS OR REPLACING TOILETS OR SHOWER HEADS WITH MORE EFFICIENT- FIXTURES. THAT CAN HELP REDUCE WATER DEMAND ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND WE SEE THAT WE SEE THAT- URBAN PER CAPITA WATER USE NOW IT REMAINS LESS THAN IT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN BEFORE THE LAST DROUGHT SO WE SEE THAT THAT HAS HAD. I'M GOING TO IMPLICATIONS. AND THEN THE FINAL CATEGORY OF SPENDING THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION PROBABLY COULD ALSO HAVE FALLEN UNDER THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE HEADER FRANKLY BECAUSE A LOT OF THAT SPENDING THE MAJORITY THAT SPENDING WAS REALLY IN RESPONSE TO EMERGENCY CONDITIONS. THINGS LIKE TRACKING FISH DOWNSTREAM RESCUING FISH FROM HATCHERIES ARE STREAMS WHERE- CONDITIONS HAVE DEGRADED- THAT ADDRESSING HUMAN WILDLIFE CONFLICT A CONFLICT FROM WILDLIFE COMING DOWN YOU KNOW HOW TO THE HILLS IN SEARCH OF FOOD BECAUSE OF. DRY CONDITIONS SO- THAT. WAS ALSO KIND OF EMERGENCY RESPONSE. IN LOOKING AT THESE EXPENDITURE THE WATER RIGHT UP TOP WITH THREE PRETTY. YOU FIND. YOU RECALL THAT PROP ONE PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN SO IN THE MIDST OF THE DROUGHT SO THOSE BIG EXPENDITURES WERE PRIMARILY CAPITAL PRIMARILY SUPPORTED BY BONDS. WHERE IS IN CONTRAST THESE OTHER EXPENDITURES WERE PRIMARILY GENERAL FUND OF THE TOTAL SPENDING GENERAL FUND MADE UP ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION ROUGHLY ABOUT 20% OF THE TOTAL SPENDING. AND THEN THERE WAS ALSO SOME SUPPORT FROM SOME SPECIAL FUNDS WHEN THE STATE WAS ABLE TO KIND OF FIND THE NEXUS BETWEEN THE REQUIREMENTS OF PARTICULAR SPECIAL FUNDS. AND THE ACTIVITY OF WANTED TO PERFORM- BUT BONDS TO TYPICALLY ARE NOT WELL SUITED FOR THAT KIND OF EMERGENCY RESPONSE BECAUSE OF THE OF THE DAY ARE THERE TYPICALLY FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS. SO THE NEXT PAGE PAGE THREE OF MY HAND OUT REALLY. COVERS WHAT I JUST SAID VERBALLY SO WE'LL SKIP AHEAD TO PAGE FOUR. I'M HERE YOU CAN SEE I WON'T GO INTO THIS IN GREAT DETAIL BUT JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU THAT THE DROUGHT RESPONSE REALLY INVOLVED A LOT OF STATE AGENCY FOURTEEN DIFFERENT STATE AGENCIES THESE REPRESENT THE- DEPARTMENTS THAT RECEIVED A SHARE OF THAT THREE POINT FOUR BILLION SHOWN ON THE PREVIOUS CHART. SO WHILE CERTAIN AGENCIES LIKE THE ONES YOU'LL HEAR FROM TODAY FISH AND WILDLIFE D. W. R. AND THAT STATE WATER BOARD PLAYED REALLY BIG ROLES. IMPORTANT HERE TO SEE THAT OTHER STATE DEPARTMENTS ALSO PLAYED A ROLE AND RECEIVED FUNDING IN DROUGHT RESPONSE. SO I'M- REALLY HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR COORDINATION OF COME BACK TO THAT AGAIN IN A MOMENT I ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU THAT SOME OF THESE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS WERE FUNDED FOR PRETTY SIMILAR EFFORTS YOU CAN SEE D. W. R. O. YES AND THE WATER BOARD WERE ALL RECEIVED FUNDING FOR ADDRESSING EMERGENCY DRINKING WATER. NEEDS IN SIMILARLY CALIFORNIA WE ASK BOTH RECEIVED FUNDING FOR REMOVING DEAD TREES- SO FUNDING SPREAD ACROSS A WIDE. A WIDE. SWATH OF STATE GOVERNMENT HERE. TURNING TO PAGE. OF THE HANDOUT. BUT IT WASN'T JUST SPENDING MORE THAN JUST MONEY THERE ARE ALSO SOME SIGNIFICANT POLICY CHANGES ENACTED BY THE STATE AND RESPONDING TO THE DROUGHT- SOME OF THOSE WERE- KIND OF AN EMERGENCY SHORT TERM BASIS EITHER THROUGH. EXECUTIVE ORDER I'M REGENCY REGULATIONS OR THE EXISTING REGULATORY AUTHORITY HAVE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS. THESE INCLUDED WATER STATEWIDE WATER CONSERVATION REQUIREMENTS FOR URBAN COMMUNITIES- THE WATER BOARD TEMPORARILY RELAXED FLOWING WATER QUALITY STANDARDS WITHIN THE DELTA CANNOT ORDERED AN ENFORCED. THAT LAST WATER BE DIVERTED FROM THE STATE'S RIVERS AND STREAMS. A FISHING GAME COMMISSION CLOSED SEVEN RIVERS AND STREAMS TO FISHING IN ORDER TO PROTECT FISH IN LOW WATER FLOW AREAS. AND THEN THE STATE ALSO A WAVE SOME STATE REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS CONTRACTING AND- SEACOR REQUIREMENTS FOR IN ORDER TO EXPEDITE. SOME DROUGHT RESPONSE ACTIVITIES. BUT IN ADDITION THOSE TERM ACTIVITIES THE STATE ALSO AND PRIMARILY THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE SOME THROUGH REGULATIONS BUT PRIMARILY THROUGH LEGISLATION ADOPTED SOME ONGOING- PERMANENT CHANGES AS WELL AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST WAS A PATH TO SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT ACT WHICH IN OF THIS COMMITTEE IS VERY FAMILIAR WITH IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. TO REGULATE THE STATE'S USE OF GROUNDWATER. THERE WAS ALSO LEGISLATION ENACTED TO- AUTHORIZES STATE TO CONSOLIDATE SMALL WATER SYSTEMS THAT FAIL TO MEET DRINKING WATER STANDARDS. BY NEW STANDARDS FOR WATER EFFICIENCY AND OUTDOOR LANDSCAPES AS WELL AS- FOR CONSERVATION OF PLANNING AND CITIES AND URBAN COMMUNITIES. AND WHILE IT WAS ADOPTED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY AFTER THE DROUGHT ENDED THIS EVENING AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FUND WHICH PROVIDES A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO ADDRESS DRINKING WATER ISSUES. I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT WAS REALLY MOTIVATED BY SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT- ERE EXACERBATED AND HIGHLIGHTED DURING THE DROUGHT AS WELL THAT'S OBVIOUSLY ABSENT SIGNIFICANT ONGOING POLICY. CHANGES ACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE. SEVEN TWO TO THE- PAGE OF THE HANDOUT LESSONS TO INFORM THE CURRENT DROUGHT I KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION PANEL IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT AS WELL. BUT SENATE REALLY JUMPED OUT AT US FROM THIS LOOK BACK AT WHAT WE DID WITH THE STATUS STATE RESPONDED LAST TIME. AND ONE OF THE FIRST IS WHAT YOU ALL ARE DOING ALREADY TODAY WHICH IS HOW CAN E BE PROACTIVE RATHER THAN REACTIVE. HOW CAN WE TAKE ACTIONS EARLY OR EARLIER BEFORE PROBLEMS WORSEN AND GET AHEAD OF. WHAT WE THINK THE PROBLEMS MIGHT BE AND WHAT WE SAW LAST TIME RATHER THAN WAITING UNTIL CONDITIONS GET REALLY DIRE. THE SECOND POINT HERE ON THE COORDINATION AND EFFICIENCY OF STATE DEPARTMENTS BEING REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT THIS IN THE NEXT PANEL AS WELL. HOW CAN WE AVOID DUPLICATION SHOULD WE BE FUNDING THREE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS TO ADDRESS DRINKING WATER ISSUES. MAYBE BUT MAYBE THAT CREATES SOME SOME- BUREAUCRACY AND DUPLICATION THAT IT MIGHT NOT BE NECESSARY SO TAKING A LOOK AT HOW CAN WE BE- AS AS A FIX EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE AS A STATE GOVERNMENT. AND THE MAIN BOX YOU KNOW MORE STAFF MORE PERMANENT STAFF IF DROUGHT IS THE NEW NORMAL TO TRY AND SET UP SOME OF THE STRUCTURE SO THAT WE ARE. BEING MORE PROACTIVE AND PREPARED TO ACQUIRE NEED ACROSS ALL OF THE DIFFERENT AREAS OF STATE GOVERNMENT THEY NEED TO BE INVOLVED. THE THIRD POINT HERE IS WHEN I MENTIONED- EARLIER BUT REALLY THINKING. AS A LEGISLATURE HOW YOU WANT TO BALANCE YOUR LONG TERM RESPONSE TO FUTURE JOBS WITH THOSE PRESSING NEEDS AND THOSE LARGE WATER SUPPLY. PROJECTS AND INVESTMENTS WELL IMPORTANT AND ESSENTIAL TO DROUGHT PREPAREDNESS. AREN'T AS EFFECTIVE IN IMMEDIATE DROUGHT RESPONSIVE THINKING ABOUT WHAT ARE YOUR GOALS. AND WHAT ARE THE APPROPRIATE FUNDING SOURCES AND- TAKES A PROJECT TO ADDRESS THOSE GOALS WHETHER THEY ARE SHORT TERM RESPONSE. OR AND- LONG TERM RESPONSE. AND THAT LEADS TO THE FOURTH POINT THERE ABOUT THE HAVE. FUN SOURCES AND THINKING ABOUT IF YOU WANT AND WHAT WE SAW DURING THE LAST ROUND WAS THAT FOR SOME OF THOSE IMMEDIATE RESPONSES EMERGENCY RESPONSES. BECAUSE OF IT'S FLEXIBILITY GENERAL FUND IS OFTEN THE BEST FOR. I HAVE BEEN ON THE POINT I JUST MENTION THIS ISN'T THE BUDGET. BUT WANT TO BE SURE THAT ALL THE MEMBERS HAVE ON THEIR RADAR OUR OFFICE PUT OUT A REPORT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO ON THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT. WHICH IS A NEW FACTOR THAT'S GOING TO BECOME A AN INCREASING ISSUE IN BUDGETARY DECISIONS AND WELL PLACED SOME LIMITATIONS EVEN AS WE FACE A HISTORIC SURPLUS. ON HOW THE STATE CAMPAÃ±A CAN SPEND SOME OF THAT FUNDING. SO I WON'T GO INTO DETAIL ON HERE UNLESS THERE ARE QUESTIONS I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS BUT JUST SOMETHING WE WANT TO BE SURE YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT. I'M THERE ARE- SOME TYPES OF EXPENDITURES THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THAT LIMIT- AND THEN SOME THAT ARE SO AS YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW I WOULD GO TO RESPOND EFFECTIVELY AND HOW TO USE THE- STATE. FUNDING THAT'S AVAILABLE. IS THAT WILL BECOME A FACTOR. I AM AN EXPERT HERE I'M GOING. WATER CHALLENGES BECOME COMPOUNDED DURING DROUGHTS I THINK THAT WAS ONE OF THE BIG HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE LAST DROUGHT. WE DO HAVE ANY FUNDING SOURCE A NEW PROGRAM TO ADDRESS DRINKING WATER ISSUES BUT I THINK WE SHOULD. ALL BE PREPARED IN THE STATE SHOULD REALLY HAVE. AS ONE OF ITS- PRIMARY FOCUS AREAS OF FOCUS IN THE COMING MONTHS AND YEARS THAT THAT THAT THAT IS UNLIKELY TO BE ANOTHER. A RESURGING PROBLEM IS THAT I'M DRINKING WATER ISSUES. THAT LEADS TO THE NEXT POINT THAT RURAL AND VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES ARE PARTICULARLY AFFECTED BY DROUGHT WE SAW THIS DURING LAST DROUGHT. NOT JUST FROM DRINKING WATER BUT ALSO ECONOMIC IMPACTS- FROM AGRICULTURAL SLOWDOWNS- IN PRODUCTION FOR EXAMPLE AND WE KNOW THAT LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ALSO FACE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS FROM THE COBIT. NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND SO ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING SO AS WE THINK ABOUT HOW THE STATE'S GOING TO RESPOND IN WHERE TO TARGET ITS ASSISTANCE THINKING ABOUT. WHAT COMMUNITIES MIGHT NEED THOSE ASSISTANCE THAT ASSISTANCE THE MOST- R. AS THEY FACE ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES- THE SECOND TO LAST POINT HERE ON FISH AND WILDLIFE JUST THE- REMINDER THAT THE STATE HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT. PUBLIC TRUST RESOURCES SUCH AS FISH WILDLIFE AND WATERWAYS ON BEHALF OF THE PUBLIC SO AS WE THINK ABOUT OUR PRIORITIES AND OUR JOB RESPONSE WE CAN HAVE TO BALANCE HUMAN NEEDS AS WELL AS ENVIRONMENTAL NEEDS. AND ONE OF THOSE ENVIRONMENTAL. IMPACTS THAT REALLY WAS HIGHLIGHTED DURING THE LAST DROUGHT WASN'T UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF DEAD TREES WHICH THEN CONTRIBUTED TO A MORE SEVERE AND INTENSE WILDFIRES WHICH LIKELY. WILL STATE SHOULD BE PREPARED TO SEE. WHETHER WHETHER THIS SUMMER- AND IN THE COMING YEARS OF DROUGHT CONDITIONS CONTINUE. SO I MISTER CHAIR THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS NOW AND ALSO HAPPY TO HANG AROUND AND- ANSWERED QUESTIONS AFTER THE ADMINISTRATION PRESENTS IF THERE ARE ANY FOR ME TO. WE WILL LOVE OPEN IT UP FOR ANY QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. AT. ONE THIRTY- THANK YOU VERY MUCH RACIAL BUT MY QUESTION IS IN REGARDS TO THE STATE HAS RECEIVED APPROXIMATELY TWENTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT UNDER THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN. WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE'S ALWAYS STRINGS ATTACHED TO IT WHEN IT COMES FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. BUT WE KNOW THAT IT CAN BE USED FOR WATER. WHAT IS A TRADE OFF FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO UTILIZE THIS ONE TIME FUNDS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COMPARED TO A BOND ISSUE AND I THINK WE'RE TALKED INTO THIS COMMITTEE COUPLE TIMES THREE POINT FIVE THREE POINT EIGHT BILLION- SO HOW CAN YOU RESPOND TO THAT FOR. THE OF THE RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU YES WE ARE FORTUNATE TO RECEIVE THE FEDERAL FUNDING- THERE ARE AS YOU MENTIONED SOME REQUIREMENTS AROUND IT ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY THAT THIS THIS- FUNDING IS MUCH MORE FLEXIBLE THAN THAN. OTHER TYPES OF FEDERAL FUNDING THEN WE USUALLY RECEIVE SO IT CAN BE USED TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE IMPACTS OF THE COCA NINETEEN PANDEMIC THERE IS A NEXUS THERE WITH WATER PARTICULARLY AROUND WATER DEBT. AND SMALL WATER SYSTEMS AND HOUSEHOLDS THAT HAVE FORMED BEHIND THE WATER BOARD AN ESTIMATE JANUARY THE TOTAL TO AT LEAST A BILLION DOLLAR STATEWIDE SO THAT WAS MONTHS AGO SO THAT'S ONE AREA THAT YOU COULD THINK ABOUT TARGETING SOME OF THAT FEDERAL FUNDING THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE MORE APPROPRIATE TO USE THAT AS COMPARED TO A BOND- OTHER AREAS. IT CAN BE USED FOR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL- WHICH OFTEN IS- ALSO A BOND APPROPRIATE. SO SOME OF THE DIFFERENCES OBVIOUSLY WITH THE FEDERAL FUNDS WE DON'T HAVE BUDGET SERVICE- SO. WE CAN USE THE FUNDS WITHOUT HAVING TO. BE CONCERNED ABOUT FUTURE COSTS ON THE GENERAL FUND. AND IT IS AVAILABLE KIND OF MORE READILY NOW- BUT THEY THERE MAY BE SOME REQUIREMENTS I THINK WE'RE STILL WAITING FROM ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AROUND SPECIFICALLY WHAT TYPES OF PROJECTS. AND WATER PROJECTS. THE FUNDS CAN BE AS FAR AS COMPARED TO A BONDS THAT IF THE STATE WERE TO CRAFT. COULD ROOM BE ADDRESS IN SOME STATE SPECIFIC NEEDS THAT THAT PERHAPS FEDERAL FUNDS WOULDN'T BE ALLOWED. SO I THINK I THINK THERE'S CERTAINLY OVERLAP WHEN IT COMES TO WATER INFRASTRUCTURE AND CAPITAL PROJECTS BUT THERE. ALSO COULD BE SOME DISTINCTION THERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN LOVE CAN OF REFER TO THAT DOUBLE R. LIMIT LATER ON FOR THE MONEY TO RESOURCES THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER SMITH. YEAH QUESTIONS. I DO HAVE A QUESTION AND THAT'S IN REGARDS TO- ISSUES THAT COME UP REGULARLY OF BACKING UP TODAY AND DIFFERENT HEARING RELATED TO STORAGE AND- FUNDING THAT'S BEEN PUT FORWARD. IN PRIOR BONDS THAT CAN YOU GIVE US AN OVERVIEW OF THE MONEY THAT IS AVAILABLE FROM PREVIOUS BONDS RELATED TO- WATER INFRASTRUCTURES SPECIFICALLY IN THE STORAGE. AREA. YES PROPOSITION ONE WAS THE MOST RECENT BOND THAT INCLUDED QUITE A BIT OF FUNDING FOR STORAGE TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS- THE WAY THE BONTA STRUCTURED IT DIDN'T ALLOCATED FOR SPECIFIC PROJECTS BUT RATHER DUMB IT'S A CONTINUOUSLY PERFORATED DOESN'T EVEN GO THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE TO IDENTIFY PROJECTS. IT'S CONVENE WITH CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED TO THE WATER COMMISSION TO DETERMINE HOW TO ALLOCATE THEM DEAFENING ACROSS DIFFERENT PROJECTS I THINK THEY CHOSE ABOUT EIGHT DIFFERENT PROJECTS FOR INITIAL ALLOCATIONS- ONE OF THOSE PROJECTS THE TEMPERANCE FLAT PROJECT HAS SINCE WITHDRAWN FROM FROM THE PROGRAM I THINK BECAUSE IT WASN'T ABLE TO. IDENTIFY SUFFICIENT OTHER FUNDING TO MATCH THE STATE PLANS SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE IS SOME FUNDING THEIR MOST MOST OF THOSE FUNDS HAS BEEN- AT LEAST INITIALLY ALLOCATED BY- THE WATER COMMISSION FOR SPECIFIC STORAGE PROJECTS BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE IS SOMETHING I THINK IT'S ROUGHLY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THAT BALLPARK. HAT WAS INITIALLY DEDICATED FOR TEMPERANCE FLAT THAT NOW- HE'S WAITING FOR THE WATER COMMISSION TO DEDICATE TO IT TO A DIFFERENT PROJECT EITHER ONE OF THE EFFORT TO ADD TO THAT ONE ANY OTHER ONES THEY'VE ALREADY. SET ASIDE FUNDING FOR OR FOR A NEW PROJECT. THERE WASN'T ANY FUNDING IN PROPOSITION. SIXTY IT SPECIFICALLY FOR WATER STORAGE. IT WOULD YOU BE IN A- TO ALLOW. YOU KNOW WHAT- IN YOUR PERSPECTIVE- IS. THE HOLD UP ON THESE PROJECTS AND YELLED THE- PROS AND CONS OF NOT MOVING THESE PROJECTS AND JUST SITTING ON THIS ON THESE BONDS. YEAH I MEAN IT PARTICULARLY IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW THE NEW DAM FOR RAISING THE DAM AND THEY THOSE ARE VERY BIG INVOLVED PROJECTS THAT TAKE A LONG TIME SO- YOU KNOW IDEA I AM NOT FAMILIAR ENOUGH WITH ANY OF THEM TO- OPINAR COMMENT ON WHETHER THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES THAT HAVE COME OUT BESIDES JUST THE- LONG TERM NATURE OF SOME OF THE BIG PROJECTS- I THINK. JUST ONE COMMENT TO MAKE IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE CANNOT RE ALLOCATE THAT MANY OR RE APPROPRIATED FOR ANYTHING ELSE BECAUSE OF HOW THE BOND A TO VOTERS IT REALLY IS- IN. THE WAY THE BOND WAS STRUCTURED UP TO THE WATER COMMISSION TO TAKE THE NEXT STEPS. THANK YOU AYE YOU KNOW THOSE ARE QUESTIONS THAT THAT COME UP QUITE OFTEN- AS I MENTIONED EARLIER CAME UP THIS MORNING. IN TERMS OF. FUTURE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED WHETHER THEY BE BE A BONDS. OR ONE TIME DOLLARS AS WAS MENTIONED BY MY COLLEAGUE- MISTER SMITH- ONE OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS OR FOR THAT MATTER STATE. SURPLUS DOLLARS THAT COULD BE PUT. TOWARDS THIS TYPE OF EFFORT. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DROUGHT RIGHT WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT ARE WE DOING ON THE SIDE OF STORAGE IS NO. ESCHEN ABOUT IT KIND OF HAND IN GLOVE DISCUSSION BUT- THANK YOU FOR- RESPONDING TO THOSE QUESTIONS. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS- YES MISTER BENNETT. SHOULD DO WE HAVE MORE PANELISTS- YES PRESENTING IT WOULD ACTUALLY HAPPEN ANOTHER WAS ONE QUESTION HERE AND THAT IS THE COMMITTEE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER WHETHER THE RESPONSE IN THE TWENTY TWELVE TO TWENTY SIXTEEN PERIOD WAS. I'M SORRY WHETHER THE RESPONSE AT TWENTY TWELVE TO TWENTY SIXTEEN PERIOD- WAS SUFFICIENT OR DO WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT WITH THIS NEW DROUGHT COMING UP. I'D LIKE TO RESPOND TO THAT- BUT I THINK IT WOULD LIKE TO WAIT. YOU HAVE OF THE PALACE IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE ONLY OFFICE WE HAVE TO TAKE THAT. THANK YOU. OKAY WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US AND THAT WE APPRECIATE YOU STICKING AROUND. IN THE CASE THAT THERE ARE QUESTIONS THAT COME UP AFTER DISCUSSIONS WITH THE OTHER. PANELISTS SO AGAIN THANK YOU. AND WE WILL- CHECK BACK IN WITH YOU IF THAT. HAPPENS WE'LL GO OUT TO BATTLE TO. ABOUT TWO A. G. JONES. FROM THE INTERSTATE RESOURCES MANAGER SHE IS THE INTERSTATE RESOURCES MANAGER AT THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. AND WE HAVE ERIC A DAHLE DEPUTY DIRECTOR DIVISION OF WATER RIGHTS STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. DARREN FULL M. S. DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION OF DRINKING WATER STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. AND CHAD GABLE DEPUTY DIRECTOR ECOSYSTEM CONSERVATION DIVISION DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE EACH ONE OF THEM HAS ABOUT FIVE TO EIGHT MINUTES TO PRESENT. AND WILL ANNOUNCE THAT-THE FIRST PANELISTS PLEASE- BEGIN. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- PLEASURE TO BE HERE BEFORE YOU THIS AFTERNOON WE WERE GOING TO SHOW A POWER POINT BUT IT LOOKS LIKE- THAT IS DISABLED IN THIS FUNCTION. SO I WILL GO AHEAD WITHOUT THE POWER POINT SO IT WAS ALL THERE WE GO. OKAY I WAS JUST GIVEN THAT ALL RIGHTY SO WE WANT TO START OUT. IN COORDINATION MY COLLEAGUES AT THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD TALKING ABOUT THE REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE THAT WAS RECENTLY AUTHORED BY THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES. AGENCY AND TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE BACKGROUND FROM THAT AS MISS UNIVERSE MENTIONED THE- ISSUE OF DROUGHT IN CALIFORNIA IS CERTAINLY NOT A NEW THING WE'VE HAD LOTS OF EXPERIENCE IN DEALING WITH DROUGHTS. AND IN THE LAST DROUGHT WE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY CHALLENGED BY THE RECORD BREAKING NATURE OF THAT DROUGHT. OF VERY WARM TEMPERATURES EXTREMELY- DRY HYDROLOGY AND- SOME NEW CHALLENGES IN THE FORM OF IMPACTS RELATED TO THAT- WARMING TRAY. INCLUDING SPECIFICALLY THINGS LIKE UP WILDFIRE FOR EXAMPLE. AND ALSO OTHER CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR FIRST EVER ZERO WATER ALLOCATIONS TO AGRICULTURAL CONTRACTORS OF THE BUREAU OF RECLAMATION'S CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT WHICH IN TURN IN INTRODUCED OTHER ISSUES SUCH AS- INCREASED GROUNDWATER PUMPING THAT IN SOME CASES AFFECTED DOMESTIC- OF. PRIVATELY OWNED DOMESTIC WELLS AND- ALSO IDENTIFYING A NUMBER OF WATER RIGHTS CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH MANAGING IN THOSE CONDITIONS SO THE C. N. R. A. REPORT LOOKED AT THESE-ITEMS THAT WERE SPECIFIED IN THE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION. AND IT WAS THE SECOND TIME THAT WE HAD A STATE WIDE DROUGHT EMERGENCY PROCLAMATION FOR DROUGHT THE FIRST TIME THE STATE ORDERED MANDATORY URBAN WATER USE REDUCTION. AND WORKING IN SOME- REALLY UNPRECEDENTED AREAS FOR US SUCH AS THE ASSISTANCE FOR THE SMALL WATER SYSTEMS AND ESPECIALLY THE PRIVATE WELL OWNERS WHOSE- WELLS WORKED- DEWATERED DURING THE DROUGHT. FOLLOWING THAT DROUGHT DURING AND FOLLOWING WE SAW A NUMBER OF NEW INITIATIVES TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES INCLUDING ENACTMENT OF THE SIGNAL I JUST LIBATION. INCREASED ATTENTION TO WATER CONSERVATION VERY IMPORTANT DOT FUNDING SOURCE- SUPPORT FOR SMALL WATER SYSTEMS BECAUSE ONE OF THE- LESSONS LEARNED FROM THIS DROUGHT WAS THE NEED TO PLAN AND ACT SOONER IN RESPONSE TO DRY CONDITIONS. BECAUSE THINGS SUCH AS THE RESPONDING TO SMALL WATER SYSTEM- OUTAGES AND- MANAGING FOR THINGS TO TAKE LONG LEAD TIME TO DEVELOPMENT TO DEVELOP. REALLY DO REQUIRE I STARTING EARLIER GETTING BACK DATA AND BEING PREPARED TO RESPOND EARLIER TO IMPACTS WE MAY NOT HAVE QUITE SEEN IN A SIMILAR FASHION IN PRIOR DROUGHTS SO YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE- SPEAKING OF. THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE I SHOULD BE DOING EARLIER IS HAVING THE DATA COLLECTION AND FORECASTING TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THESE ACTIONS THAT WE NEED TO TAKE WHETHER IT IS- CONTRACTING FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE TO BE ABLE TO. UPGRADE AND IMPROVE THEIR FACILITIES AND RESPOND TO- WATER CONDITIONS OR TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE TO THE SMALL WATER SYSTEMS SO ARE OUT OF THIS WE'VE IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES TO MOVE FORWARD IN THE DATA AND FORECASTING. AREA AND ALSO REALLY WORKING ON CLOSE COORDINATION AMONG OUR AGENCIES AND ONE GOOD EXAMPLE OF COORDINATION AMONG OUR AGENCIES WAS THE WORK THAT WAS DONE IN THE LAST ROUTE WITH THE VERY CLOSE COORDINATION OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT AND FEDERAL CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT OPERATIONS. WITH THE STATE AND FEDERAL FISHERY AGENCIES AND WITH THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD WHICH HAD A NUMBER OF OUR CHALLENGES TO ADDRESS IN TERMS OF MANAGING WATER RIGHTS WITH LIMITED DATA AND UNDER THESE EXTREMELY DRY HYDROLOGIC CONDITIONS. SO YOU KNOW HOW DOES THIS INFORM OUR RESPONSE IN THE ACTIONS WERE TAKING THE CURRENT DROUGHT WELL- SO WE'VE HAD NOW A SEPARATE DRY YEAR VERY DRY IN MUCH OF THE STATE ABOUT HALF OF AVERAGE PRECIPITATION FOR MANY PARTS OF THE STATE. AND WE ARE IN FACT SEEING STREAM FLOWS IN OUR MAJOR SIERRA CASCADE RIVER BASINS THAT ARE SO IMPORTANT FOR URBAN AND AGRICULTURAL SUPPLIES ACTUALLY TRACKING- BELOW OR AT THE LEVELS WE SAW IN THE TWO DRIEST YEARS OF THE LAST DROUGHT IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY FIFTEEN- WHICH IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT GIVES MY COLLEAGUES AT THE- STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. LAWS BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO ADMINISTER THE WATER RIGHTS UNDER THESE VERY CHALLENGING CIRCUMSTANCES AND ALSO POINTING OUT THE EFFECT OF LONG TERM WARMING IN THE CLIMATE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE BEEN SEEING THERE'S REALLY BEEN A NOTICEABLE CHANGE SINCE IN THIS CENTURY AS COMPARED TO DROUGHTS IN PRIOR CENTURIES. WITH THE IMPACT OF WARMING CONDITIONS- LOWER RUNOFF EFFICIENCY FACTOR MEANING THAT EVEN IF WE GET A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF. RAINFALL LITTLE BETTER THAN AVERAGE LET'S SAY IN THE NEXT WATER YEAR WE MAY STILL BE DEALING WITH DRY CONDITIONS IN THE NEXT YEAR BECAUSE MORE WATER IS- BEING LOST TO THE SYSTEM AND THEREFORE WE REALLY DO HAVE TO PROACTIVELY PLANNED FOR. WHAT IF NEXT YEAR IS DRY SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE AT D. W. R. HAVE BEEN DOING- ON THE STATE WATER PROJECT SITE- STREAMLINE THE WATER TRANSFER PROCESS FOR- PEOPLE WHO WANT TO USE OUR FACILITIES TO MOVE WATER. PREPARING DROUGHT CONTINGENCY PLAN AND- SHARING THAT WITH THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD AND FISHING WILDLIFE. UPDATING OUR INFORMATION COLLECTION. ABOUT REPORTING OF DR PRICE BUT WELLS SO THAT WE NOT HELP PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO THESE FOLKS AS WE SEE THESE CONDITIONS DEVELOPMENT AND RECENTLY WE SUBMITTED A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE WITH RECOMMENDATIONS ON. INCREASED UP TECHNICAL AND OTHER ASSISTANCE FOR THE SMALL WATER SYSTEMS AND RURAL COMMUNITIES THAT WE KNOW FROM PAST EXPERIENCE HAVE BEEN SO ADVERSELY AFFECTED DURING OUR PRIOR BALLOTS BECAUSE LARGER URBAN WATER AGENCIES TEND TO BE ABLE TO. HAVE THE RESOURCES AND THE CAPACITY TO MANAGE WELL TO MEET OUR CUSTOMERS NEEDS BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LARGE RATEPAYER BASE AND KEY- AFFORD THE INVESTMENTS AND RELIABILITY WHICH IS NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE FOR SYSTEMS THAT ONLY HAVE A FEW HUNDRED CONNECTIONS. AND THIS IS WHERE I SHOULD STOP AND ASK GOD IF MY COLLEAGUES AT THE WATER BOARD WITH LIKE TO CHIME IN. THANK HI THIS IS ERIC I THOUGHT I THINK I A- I CAN GO FIRST IN TURN WILL GO. SUBSEQUENTLY GOOD- AFTERNOON. CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE PANEL MY NAME IS ERIC ACT ON THE TIP HE DIRECTOR FOR THE DIVISION OF WATER RIGHTS AT THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. AND TO FOLLOW JEANINE'S STATEMENTS I'D LIKE TO OFFER A FEW- KIND OF HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEWS OF. CHALLENGES AND- FIVE SUCCESSES IN AND FUTURE AREAS WHERE WE WANT TO FOCUS ON IMPROVEMENT FOR THIS DROUGHT AS WELL AS FUTURE DROUGHTS THAT COULD OCCUR. AS JEANINE HIGHLIGHTED THE- TWENTY TWELVE TO TWENTY SIXTEEN DROUGHT. WE HAD A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES WITHIN THE DIVISION OF WATER RIGHTS- WE ISSUED CURTAILMENT NOTICES OR NOTICES OF WATER UNAVAILABILITY TO OVER NINE THOUSAND WATER RIGHT HOLDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. HE IS- WATER RIGHT HOLDERS RANGED IN PRIORITY FROM ABOUT NINETEEN OH TWO TO THE RESIDENTS AND AFFECTED MILLIONS OF ACRE FEET OF POTENTIAL WATER DIVERSIONS FROM OUR STATE'S SURFACE WATER SYSTEMS. ALONG WITH THOSE CURTAILMENT NOTICES CAME IN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF SITE INSPECTIONS AND WHILE ENFORCEMENT ISN'T ALWAYS A POPULAR WORD IN SOME AREAS- IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT COMPONENT IN MAKING SURE THAT- THE STATE'S WATER RATES SYSTEM IS FOLLOWED AND THAT PEOPLE ARE COMPLYING WITH THE CURTAILMENT NOTICES. WHEN THEY ARE- ISSUED. WE ALSO ISSUED A NUMBER OF WHAT'S REFERRED TO AS TEMPORARY URGENCY CHANGE PETITIONS AND THESE ARE PETITIONS TO MODIFY. PERMIT TERMS OR REQUIREMENTS WHEN CONDITIONS MAY BE UNAVOIDABLE OR UNFORESEEABLE. IN A REALLY NEEDED I KIND OF EMERGENCY CONDITIONS WE DID A NUMBER OF QC PEAS IN THE BROADER BE DELTA WATERSHED BUT ALSO OTHER WATERSHED THROUGHOUT THE STATE INCLUDING THE RUSSIAN RIVER. WE ALSO ADOPTED A NUMBER OF VERY SUCCESSFUL INSTREAM FLOW EMERGENCY REGULATIONS THESE WERE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON AN ADDRESS FISH HABITAT IN MIDDLE DEER AND ANTELOPE CREEK WHICH ARE TRIBUTARIES TO THE SACRAMENTO. AS WELL AS FOR SMALL TRIBUTARIES TO THE RUSSIAN RIVER. AND THESE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN ENSURING KIND OF MINIMAL WHAT WE SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS BELLY SCRAPING FLOWS TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S JUST ENOUGH WATER TO. HELP PREVENT- IN. LOSS OF ENTIRE COHORTS OF CERTAIN PER CLASS IS A OF A FISH. AND ALTHOUGH I'D IT WAS NOT DIRECTLY WITHIN THE DIVISION OF WATER RIGHTS THAT DELTA WATER MASTER. DEVELOPED EXECUTED A VOLUNTARY DROUGHT AGREEMENT FOR WATER USERS IN THE DELTA THE ULTIMATELY RESULTED IN APPROXIMATELY 25% REDUCTION IN OVERALL WATER DIVERSIONS FROM SERVICE DELTA WATERS. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SUCCESSES IT HIGHLIGHTED THE NOTICES OF WATER UNAVAILABILITY IT WAS THE FIRST TIME IN ABOUT FORTY YEARS THAT THE DIVISION HEAD ISSUED THAT SCOPE AND SCALE OF. CURTAILMENT NOTICES- THAT WAS A SIGNIFICANT LIFT FOR THE DIVISION BUT ULTIMATELY ONE THAT WAS FAIRLY SUCCESSFUL. EMERGENCY INSTREAM REGULATIONS WERE ALSO SUCCESSFUL AND- THE NUMBER OF ENFORCEMENT INSPECTIONS OVER TWO YEAR TIME PERIOD WE DID ABOUT. A TWENTY TWO HUNDRED INSPECTIONS AND SITE VISITS COMPARED TO A NORMAL YEAR WHERE WE MIGHT HAVE BETWEEN FIFTY AND ONE HUNDRED- THAT CAME WITH ADDITIONAL STAFF RESOURCES TO HELP US DO THAT. IT WAS A SIGNIFICANT LIFT BUT ULTIMATELY HI. PERFECTIVE IN ENSURING THAT THE BOARD'S CURTAILMENT NOTICES WERE FOLLOWED OR OBSERVED. WE ALSO HAD A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES IN SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES CONTINUE HI SACRAMENTO RIVER TEMPERATURE WAS A CHALLENGING THE PREVIOUS DROUGHT. I THINK IT REMAINS A BIT OF A CHALLENGE THIS YEAR AS WELL ALTHOUGH. THE COORDINATION AND COMMUNICATION BETWEEN OUR STATE AND FEDERAL PARTNERS. HAS MARKEDLY IMPROVED AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE- US BUREAU OF RECLAMATION NDW ARE. INTENDED MANAGING- JUST BROADER WATER RELEASES FROM PROJECT OPERATIONS TO ENSURE. IN TEMPERATURE ALTHOUGH FROM SHASTA IT'S LARGELY THE CDP OR US BUREAU OF RECLAMATION THAT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE RELEASES. HI AND IT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IN KIND OF LONG TERM ISSUES THAT WE'VE WE'VE NOTED IN THE PREVIOUS DROUGHT AND CONTINUE TO HIDE OBSERVE OUR TIMELINESS IN TERMS OF DATA WATER RATES DATA IS REPORTEDLY CURRENTLY UP TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS AFTER IT WAS ACTUALLY DIVERTED WHICH RAISES CHALLENGES FOR HOW TIMELY WE CAN KIND OF OBSERVE AND COMPILE AND UNDERSTAND WATER USE IN ACROSS A REAL TIME BASIS. TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE JUDGES WE RECENTLY DEVELOPED A REPORT CALLED THE WATER RIGHTS DROUGHT AFTER REVIEW OR WATER REPORT. HEY INVOLVES REACHING OUT TO A NUMBER OF STAKEHOLDERS TO YOU ESSENTIALLY ASK THEM WHAT WORKED WELL DURING THE PREVIOUS DROUGHT WHAT DIDN'T WHAT ARE THE AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT. AND FROM THOSE TWENTY FOLLOWER TWENTY FOUR ENTITIES. THERE WERE- OVER FIVE HUNDRED UNIQUE RECOMMENDATIONS. BUT THEY ALL KIND OF FELL AND WITHIN FOUR BROAD CATEGORIES AVERAGING COMMUNICATION WAS CITED BY EVERY SINGLE PARTICIPANT. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT- DIVISION IS SPECIFICALLY FOCUSING ON THIS. YEAR AND THIS DROUGHT. DATA AND ACCOUNTING WERE ALSO IDENTIFIED BY ALMOST EVERY PARTICIPANT. AND I'M SITTING AREAS WHERE WE COULD SHARE DATA EARLIER AND HAVE A BETTER KIND OF QAQC DATA. HI THERE WOULD BE ONE OF POLICY AND POLICY UNCERTAINTIES I THINK THAT THOSE STILL REMAIN IN MANY RESPECTS- AND THEN ALSO COORDINATION JUST BETWEEN. OUR STATE PARTNERS AND OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS AS WELL AND THAT'S AGAIN AN AREA THAT WE'RE ACTIVELY IMPROVING UPON AND FOCUSING ON CURRENTLY. I THINK WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE DURABLE HEMOS. THANK YOU WORK AND THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- I'M TERRIBLE HIM IS I'M DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE DIVISION OF DRINKING WATER AT STATE WATER BOARD. I WANTED TO FOCUS TODAY- LARGELY ON OUR RESPONSE FOR WATER SYSTEMS- DURING THE LAST DROUGHT THERE WERE A LOT OF SYSTEMS THAT PERFORMED ADMIRABLY LARGELY ARE LARGE SYSTEMS WE HAVE FOUR HUNDRED WATER SYSTEMS THAT WE- CONSIDERED TO BE A LARGE DELIVER THE BOOK THE WATER TO LARGEST POPULATION IN THE STATE. HOWEVER WE ALSO HAVE OVER TWO THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED SMALL WATER SYSTEMS IN THE STATE- AN INCREDIBLE NUMBER- AND THEY RANGE IN A LOT OF DIVERSITY- MANY OF THEM UNDER RESOURCE AND OR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND THEY AS A MISS OVERSTATED OFTEN SUFFER THE MOST AND I CONDITIONS LIKE THESE. SO FOCUSING ON THE LESSONS WE LEARNED FROM THE LAST DROUGHT. OF FOUR KIND OF AREAS I WANTED TO TOUCH ON ONE OF THEM IS WERE THIS YEAR UNDER THIS CONDITIONS STARTING TO PERFORM EARLY ASSESSMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH HOW THE WATER SYSTEMS ARE PERFORMING- SPECIFICALLY WELL MONITORING UNDERSTANDING THE LEVELS OF WATER IN THEIR WELLS SO THAT WE- CAN. ADDRESS THE SITUATION BEFORE THEY ACTUALLY HAVE DRY WELLS ON THEIR HANDS AND- MAYBE EVEN UP YOU KNOW PULLED ERA TO THE PUMPS AND DAMAGED EQUIPMENT WHICH OBVIOUSLY CREATES A MUCH MORE CATASTROPHIC FAILURE THAN JUST ON THE WATER FLOWS. AND SO ON THAT ALONG WITH UNDERSTANDING OF WATER SYSTEMS A CALL FROM RESERVOIRS AND HAVE IN TAKES IN THOSE RESERVOIRS MANY SMALL SYSTEMS DO THAT- AND IT'S NOT THE DRESS OR HAS TO GO INTO BEFORE THEIR INTAKE IS ABOVE THE WATER SURFACE. AND SUB MONITORING THE LEVEL AS RESERVOIRS ARE MOVED DOWN AND THEY'RE GREATLY DEPLETED THIS YEAR I'M COMING INTO THIS THIS IS YOUR AT THE END OF THE- SEASON SO- IT'S SUPER CRITICAL THAT WE BE ABLE TO MONITOR THOSE AND ANTICIPATE. AT A TIME BEFORE GOING TO NEED TO TAKE EMERGENCY ACTIONS ALONG THE WATER SYSTEM. TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY MAINTAIN THEIR WATER FLOW. I KNOW VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE SAW THE LAST WAS DOMESTIC WILL FAILURES. AND WE HAVE ALREADY. THERE INCREASE THE TECH ASSISTANCE. OUR MONEY THAT WE PROVIDE TO SEVERAL OF OUR- NON GOVERNMENTAL PARTNERS THAT WORK IN THIS SPACE WITH US. TO ASSIST PRIVATE DOMESTIC WELL OWNERS AND SO THAT PROGRAM IS- GETTING READY TO TAKE OFF AS I'M SURE. WE HAPPEN WE STILL HAVE DRY WELLS FROM THE LAST DROUGHT WATER SYSTEMS THAT. ARE INDIVIDUAL PRIVATE DOMESTIC WELLS IS NOT RECOVERED AND ARE STILL IN THE PROGRAM AND THE PROGRAM IS BASICALLY CONTINUE TO RUN AND OUR JUST. AMPING IT UP A LITTLE BIT MORE TO. ANTICIPATED INCREASE THERE UNFORTUNATELY. THIRDLY IS- WATER QUALITY OF STAND BY WELLS. DURING THE INTERIM-PERIOD BETWEEN THE DROUGHTS WE'VE HAD SEVERAL NEW. MAXIMUM CONTAMINANT LEVELS UP AND OTHER CONTAMINATING EVENTS COME INTO PLAY THAT WEREN'T IN THE LAST DROUGHT SPECIFICALLY ONE TWO THREE T. C. P. HAS IMPACT AND IMPACT A LARGE NUMBER OF DRINKING WATER WELLS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY- AND SOME IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND THEN WE HAVE THE P. FAST CONTAMINATION AS WELL THERE'S NOT A REGULATORY LIMIT THERE BUT- THERE IS LEGISLATION ABOUT PUBLIC NOTIFICATION AND MOST WATER SYSTEMS ARE TRYING TO LIMIT THEIR OUR POPULATIONS EXPOSURE TO THOSE CHEMICALS BY TAKING WHILE OFFLINE. CHANNELS ARE NOT SERVING THAT WATER BUT OF COURSE REMOVES A RESOURCE THAT THEY WERE COUNTING ON HEADING INTO THIS DROUGHT. AND SO ONE OF OUR PRIORITIES HERE IS TO MAKE SURE WE COMMUNICATE WITH WATER SYSTEMS THAT AS THEY PLAN TO BRING BACK. THOSE TYPE OF WELLS- THAT THEY PLANNED NOW FOR MAKING SURE THEY'RE INSTALLING THE NECESSARY TREATMENT TO MAINTAIN WATER QUALITY AS THEY BRING THAT STAND BY WHILE BACK. AND WE'RE COMMITTING TO WORK WITH THEM TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN AND PRIORITIZE OUR- OUR RESOURCES AS WELL TO MAKE SURE WERE PROMOTING THOSE IN GETTING THOSE SOURCES BACK ONLINE AHEAD OF OTHER WORK THAT WE WOULD NORMALLY BE DOING. AND FINALLY- ERIC MENTIONED THE CURTAILMENT ORDERS THAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR. LAST DROUGHT. PREVIOUSLY WE HAD A TWENTY TWO THOSE WHERE WE ISSUE A- A COROLLARY BUILDING MORATORIUM OR CONNECTION MORATORIUM TO MAKE SURE THE WATER SYSTEMS ARE NOT ADDING. FURTHER CAPACITY DEMANDS. BECAUSE THEY'RE UNDER CURTAILMENT. AND JUST TRYING TO MEET HEALTH AND SAFETY FLOWS. OUR PREPARING TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT AS WE DID LAST TIME AS- CURTAILMENTS ARE NECESSARY AND- TO FOLLOW THROUGH. AND WITHOUT I WILL. IN MY PRESENTATION AND STAND BY FOR QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE HAVE. I THINK ONE FINAL PRESENTER AND THAT THE CHAD DOUBLE THE P. DIRECTOR OF THE ECOSYSTEM CONSERVATION DIVISION DEPARTMENT OF- FISH AND WILDLIFE. THAT'S RIGHT THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR OF ME TODAY I'LL BE SITTING AT FOR DIRECTOR BOTTOM. MY NAME IS JOE DEWAN THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE ECOSYSTEM CONSERVATION DIVISION A PHARMACIST WHILE I. WAS ASKED TO PROVIDE YOUR UPDATE ON LESSONS FROM THE LAST DROP. IT HIGHLIGHTS SOME OF THE CURRENT ACTIVITIES THE DEPARTMENTS ALREADY ENGAGED IN IN RESPONSE THE DRY CONDITIONS WE'RE EXPERIENCING ACROSS THE STATE. DURING THE LAST DROUGHT WOULD SPEND ROUGHLY FROM TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. THE DEPARTMENT IS ACTIVELY INVOLVED ON MANY FRONTS TO NOT ONLY RESPOND TO THE CONDITIONS WE EXPERIENCE BUT ALSO BEGIN. BUILDING CAPACITY AND RESILIENCY FOR THE FUTURE. SHOULD BE FIND OURSELVES IN THE STATE RIGHT NOW. AND I AGREED SHERMAN. THAT IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT WE FIND OURSELVES AGAIN HERE SO SOON. THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE LAST DROUGHT THE DEPARTMENT SPOTTED QUICKLY TO REDIRECT STAFF TO BRING TEMPORARY HELP TO THE TUNE OF TWO HUNDRED STUFF OR WILDLIFE AND FISHERIES FUNCTIONS. THIS EXCEEDED APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND HOURS OF STAFF TIME. THE WORK CONDUCTED FOCUSED ON SEVERAL KEY AREAS RELATED TO MONITORING. FISH WILDLIFE RESCUES AND RELEASE STRATEGIES WATER SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS FOR HIGH TREASON WELL IF THERE IS. VOLUNTARY DROUGHT AGREEMENTS TO AUGMENT CHILL FLOWS AND CERTAIN WATERWAYS. TEMPORARY FISHING CLOSURES- AND IN THE DRESSING HIMMATWALA CONFLICTS. TO GIVE YOU A COUPLE EXAMPLES THE LAST ROUTE WE DEPLOYED STAFF TO MONITOR MANY OF OUR WATER WAYS AND VOCAL SPECIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THIS ALLOWED US TO BETTER UNDERSTAND DROUGHT RELATED THREATS TO THE SPECIES AND HELP TO MAKE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT DECISIONS. SOME OF THIS INCLUDED PROVIDING ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TO THE STATE WATER PROJECT TO MONITOR KEY LOCATIONS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY TO HELP MINIMIZE DROUGHT AFFECTS AND IMPLEMENT DELTA SPECIFIC REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY. SOME OF THESE MONITORING OPERATIONS WERE CONDUCTED TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK DURING HIGH MIGRATION BIRDS. THE MARKET DEPARTMENT CONDUCTED OVER NINE HUNDRED THIRTY FISH RESCUES OF THIRTY EIGHT DIFFERENT FISH SPECIES EXCEEDING TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND FISH. WERE RICHARD LET THE FISH RESPONSE ACTIONS SUCH AS TRUCKING OVER FIFTY MILLION SALMON SMALTZ THE DOWNSTREAM REALLY STARTS. RATHER THAN ALLOWING THEM TO MAKE THEIR WAY DOWN THE CENTRAL VALLEY RIVERS. HOPEFULLY IMPROVING THEIR CHANCES OF SURVIVAL. ALL TOTALED WE BROUGHT IN MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND FISH IN THE CAPTIVITY AND MORE THAN A HUNDRED QUANTIC DEPENDENT TRACHSEL ANIMALS. THAT WOULD THEN CARE FOR ANGELA HOW TO TOUCH RECOVERED IN THE ANIMALS COULD BE RETURNED TO THE WILD. WE IMPLEMENTED WATER USE EFFICIENCY PROJECTS ARE WILDLIFE AREAS ECOLOGICAL RESERVES AND HATCHERIES. THE HELP CONSERVE WATER IMPROVE FUNCTION RESILIENCY AT THESE FACILITIES. THIS INCLUDED INSTALLATION OF. WATER RECIRCULATION SYSTEMS CHILLERS. FISH RESCUE UNITS UV SYSTEMS TO KILL PATHOGENS. THE NEW TANKS IN FISH TANKS TO REAR TROUT STEELHEAD AND SALMON. UNDER THESE OF NORMAL CONDITIONS WE'RE EXPERIENCING. WE WORKED QUICKLY WITH THE NATIONAL RESEARCH. SERVICE WATER BOARD AND LOCAL LANDOWNERS. IN THE IRRIGATION DISTRICTS TO NEGOTIATE VOTER DROUGHT AGREEMENTS. THAT ENABLE US TO MONITOR RESCUE FISH DEVELOP FORBEARANCE AGREEMENTS AND MODIFIED PROVISIONS OF ENTRY FLOOR APARTMENTS TO STRIKE AN APPROPRIATE BALANCE. BETWEEN PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THE DEPARTMENT WORKS THE FISHING COMMISSION TO ADOPT REGULATE. ALLOWING THE DEPARTMENT TEMPORARILY CLOSE DROUGHT AFFECTED DISTRICTS. WE ALSO IMPLEMENTED A SUCCESSFUL HUMAN WILDLIFE CONFLICT PROGRAM THAT CONTINUES TODAY WE HAVE OVER TWENTY THOUSAND HUMAN WILDLIFE CONFLICT INCIDENTS REPORTED BETWEEN. TWENTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN. WHAT WE LEARNED WAS THAT IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS IT'S ALL HANDS ON DECK AND THAT WE ALL NEED TO BE ROWING IN THE SAME DIRECTION. GIPSON MATTER. PEOPLE MATTER THAT OUR PUBLIC TRUST RESOURCES MATTER. AS THE L. A. REPORT POINTS OUT THERE ARE SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH CAPACITY FOR ONE AGENCY OR DEPARTMENT. OR ONE GROUP TO DO IT ALONE. THESE EFFORTS TAKE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RESOURCES AND SUPPORT FROM ALL LEVELS. WE ALSO LEARNED THAT THERE WERE NOT THAT WE WERE NOT AS PREPARED AS WE NEED TO BE FOR WHAT SEEMS TO BE A RECURRING THEME FOR STATE. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE WHILE ALSO CONTINUING TO BUILD RESILIENCY FOR LESSEN THE IMPACTS OF DROUGHT. THE PROVIDE WATER FOR US AND ARE YOU UNIQUE BIODIVERSITY. SO THIS LEASE WHICH IS TODAY SOME OF THE ACTIONS THAT WERE PREPARED TO TAKE AS WELL SOME OF THE THINGS WE'RE ALREADY DOING. AS WE SPEAK THE DEPARTMENT AGAIN TRUCKING APPROXIMATE SEVENTEEN MILLION FALL RUN CHINOOK SALMON. BURKE CENTRAL VALLEY SALMON HATCHERIES. TO BE RELEASED IN THE SAN FRANCISCO SAN PABLO BASED. TO THE POOR FLOWING WATER QUALITY CONDITIONS AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY RIVERS AND ADULTS. THROUGH OUR EFFORTS WITH THE WATER BOARD WE'RE CONTINUING TO BUILD OUR RELATIONSHIPS DEVELOPED DURING THE LAST FROM. WORKING WITH LANDOWNERS LOCAL STATE FEDERAL AGENCIES TO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES FOR VOLUNTARY DROUGHT AGREEMENTS. MERGINGSEA CHECK PROGRAMS DEVELOPMENT OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES TO RESPOND TO LOCALIZED AND REGIONAL DROUGHT CONDITIONS. WE'RE PREPARED OF SILK TO FACILITATE RAPID IMPLEMENTATION OF DROUGHT RELIEF MEASURES THE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COMMERCIAL RECREATIONAL SALMON FISHING ORGANIZATIONS THE FEDERAL FISHING SEES. THE PARTNERSHIPS WE'VE FORGED DURING THE LAST ROW. WERE USING THE TECHNOLOGIES AND EQUIPMENT REQUIRED DURING THE LAST STRAW SUCH AS THE STATE OF THE ART TRAILERS THAT SHOULD ALLOW FOR HIGHER SURVIVAL SURVIVAL RATES OF OUR TRUCKS YOU WILL SOON. UPGRADE WE MADE TO ENERGY EFFICIENT WATER WELL PUMPS USING SOLAR POWER ENABLING US TO PROVIDE WATER TO DEPARTMENT ODWALLA FOR IS AN ECOLOGICAL RESERVES. THOSE WERE WISE INVESTMENTS. THAT WE ARE BENEFITING FROM NOW. WHAT SPECIFICALLY IN THE RUSH RIVER WHICH IS ARGUE LEASING SOME OF THE MOST IMMEDIATE DROUGHT AFFECTS. SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN THE DEPARTMENT HAS AWARDED TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN PROP ONE FOUR G. P. AND PROP SIXTY EIGHT GRANT FUNDING TO THIRTY ONE RESTORATION PROJECTS TO HELP BUILD CRITICAL CRITICAL NEEDED HABITAT. AND RELIEF FOR THOSE A MEASURE MUSTACHE. LASTLY THE DEPARTMENT IS POISED SHOULD WE NEED TO GO THERE TO WORK WITH THE FISHING IN COMMISSION TO RAPIDLY RESPOND. TO AT RISK FISHERIES VIA FISHING VOTERS. WHEN WATER QUALITY AND FLOW CONDITIONS ARE DEEMED TO POSE A THREAT TO THE FISHERIES. THESE MEASURES ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE FISHERIES ARE PROTECTED OTHER CRITICAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. SO WITH THAT I WILL USE MY TIME BACK TO THE PAY WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS THANK YOU FROM ME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LOL ASCA. MEMBERS OF OUR COMMITTEE. THE ONE ADDRESSING QUESTIONS TO. ME THE PALACE THE MOBILE THE SMOKERS. WERE HEARD IN START OF ALWAYS WANTED TO ASK THIS QUESTION AND IT'LL BE OF. CHAD. FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. THE DELTA SMELT IS NOT NATIVE TO THE DELTA. ESTUARY SEKARANG. IF DELTA SMELT IS NOT DATA TO THE ASSURE. I'M NOT SURE I'M FOLLOWING YOUR QUESTION AUGUST OKAY THE DELTA IS MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE DELTA SMELT IS NOT NATIVE TO THE DELTA. AREA THERE AND SAID THAT THE WHOLE AREA IS IT TRUE THAT THE DELTA SMELT IS NOT NATIVE TO THAT AREA. I WOULD HAVE TO CONSULT WITH OUR FOLKS NOT SURE IF I FULLY UNDERSTAND. THAT THE STATE'S POPULATION THAT WE HAVE ADULTS IS NOT THAT THEY DON'T. BY DELTA. BECAUSE I DID A TOUR WENT WHEN I WAS ON A WATER BOARD ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO. IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE IS RAISING THE DELTA SMELT. AND PUTTING IT IN THE DELTA I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE TO FEED THE OTHER FISH BUT IT IS NOT NATIVE WHY ARE WE RAISING IT TO FISH FEED THE OTHER FISH IN THE DELTA. WHICH CREATES A PROBLEM FOR PUMPING OUT THE DELTA TO GO TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. BUT IF YOU CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION OF THE DELTA SMELT IS NOT NATIVE. WE'RE ALREADY AT THE END HERE. CAN ANYONE ANYONE ELSE CENTER ON THE PANEL IF THE DELTA SMELT IS NATIVE. TO THE DELTA. OKAY THEY WILL GO THAT CAN HELP THE SIMILAR. THE DELTA SMELT IS NATIVE TO THE DELTA. IT ISN'T NATIVE TO THE DELTA WHO SAID THAT. SORRY THIS IS OUT. SO DOES NOT IS A NATIVE SPECIES TO THIS DOCTOR I'M NOT SURE IF I UNDERSTOOD SORRY I APOLOGIZE FULLY WERE UNDERSTANDING THAT DOCTOR SMITH RELATES TO THE WESTERN COAST OR PERHAPS THE DARKEST OF THE NATIVE SPECIES TO I'VE ALWAYS BEEN UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT IT WAS NOT NATIVE. TO THE DELTA SO I'LL CHECK ON THAT PART ANYWAY. IN THIS IS FOR. ANYONE MAYBE EVEN SEND THAT JOHN'S. THE IN A IN REGARDS TO THE PROP ONE FUNDS THAT CALIFORNIA VOTERS AND VOTED IN IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. DO INCLUDED TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS FOR NEW WATER STORAGE. HOW MUCH OF THAT MONEY HAS BEEN SPENT ON STORAGE SINCE THEN. I'D HAVE TO SAY I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY LOOK IT UP AND GET BACK TO YOU OKAY AND THEN A FOLLOW UP ON THAT IS EIGHT HUNDRED TEN MILLION DOLLARS WERE FOR REGIONAL WATER PROJECTS DO YOU HAVE A LIST OF THE WATER PROJECTS AND HOW MUCH OF THAT MONEY HAS BEEN SPENT. WE CAN CERTAINLY- COME UP WITH THAT PROVIDE FOR YOU. OKAY AND HOW MUCH OF THAT OF MONEY IS BEEN SPELT SPENT AND PROJECTS TO HELP US IN THE DROUGHT THAT WERE IN CURRENTLY BECAUSE WE GO ALL THERE'S BEEN A DROUGHT IN CALIFORNIA FOR ALWAYS FOR THE LAST HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS. BUT I WAS WONDERING HOW MUCH MONEY HAS BEEN SPENT IN WATER STORAGE. AND HOW MUCH CAPACITY ADDITIONAL CAPACITY IS AVAILABLE BECAUSE THE RESULT OF ANY OF THESE PROJECTS IN THE MONEY SPENT. WE WILL GET A RESPONSE TO ON THAT. I GET A FOLLOW UP FOR THAT MY BIG KEY FOR HERE HAS BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE AS WE'VE BEEN IN A DROUGHT. FOR LET'S JUST SAY OFTEN OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS WE ALWAYS HAVE A DROP CALIFORNIA WHY HAVE WE NOT USED OUR RESOURCES FOR WATER STORAGE. THE SIGN SITES RESERVOIR PROJECT. I DO BELIEVE FIFTY TWO YEARS AGO IT STARTED THAT PROJECT. I'D LIKE TO KNOW HOW MANY LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN FILED THEY MIGHT ENVIRONMENTAL COLLEAGUES TO STOP THEIR PROJECT. OVER ALL THESE YEARS AND HOW MUCH MONEY HAS BEEN SPENT LITIGATING THESE LAWSUITS. ANOTHER ONE IS THE TEMPERS FLATS DAMS IS SOUTH OF THE DELTA. HOW MANY LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST THAT PROJECT WITH MY ENVIRONMENTAL COLLEAGUES TO STOP THAT PROJECT. AND I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND TOUCH A NERVE I'M FEELING GOOD RIGHT NOW. CAN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER. WAVE ALL THESE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES THAT COME UP IN BUILD RESERVOIR IN CALIFORNIA FOR WATER STORAGE WE HAVE A WET YEAR THE WAY WE'RE GONNA GET THROUGH THESE CAN'T CONTINUE TO LET IT RUN OUT INTO THE OCEAN IF WE STORED THAT WATER WE WOULD HAVE IT WHEN WE HAVE A DRY YEAR. SO I COULD TAKE JUST A FIRST STEP TO ANSWERING THAT QUESTION AND THAT WOULD BE- AN EXECUTIVE ORDER FROM THE GOVERNOR SIMPLY DIRECTS STATE AGENCIES. TO TAKE SPECIFIED ACTIONS TO ACTUALLY WAVE STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS WOULD REQUIRE AN EMERGENCY PROCLAMATION AND THE STATE EMERGENCY PROCLAMATION COULD NOT WAIVE FEDERAL LAWS OR REGULATIONS. OKAY. BUT I MUST TO TOUCH ANOTHER NERVE CAN YOU TELL ME WELL IT'S GONNA BE HARD TO CLICK QUANTIFY WHEN THE DELTA SMELT WAS NATIVE. BECAUSE WHEN I WOULD DID MY TOUR OF THE DELTA THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE WAS RAISING THE DELTA SMELT. SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN TELL ME NINETEEN THIRTY OR NINETEEN FIFTY THE DELTA SMELT. WAS FOUND IN THE DELTA OR WHEN IT WAS SO VERY. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE DELTA SMELT IT IS ENDEMIC TO CALIFORNIA SO IT MEANS MEANING IT ONLY LIVES IN THE DELTA INSIGHTS NAME THE DOG THE SELL IT WAS LISTED UNDER C. SIR IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE I CAN'T I CAN'T GIVE YOU THAT SO I CAN LOOK BACK TO DETERMINE WHEN WE FIRST DISCOVERED ADULT THE SMOKE I DON'T KNOW THAT NUMBER OFF HAND BUT THEY'RE ENDEMIC MEANING THEY ONLY THEY ONLY LIVE IN ARE FOUND WITHIN THE DELTA. THANK YOU. SMITH ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT MR. SO I HAVE A GRAPHING FOR ME FROM THE- WATER COMMISSION'S WEBSITE SHOWING COMPLETION OF THESE PROJECTS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOR THAT WATER STORAGE OF TWENTY THIRTY SO TODAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM PAST TROUT. AND HOW WE CAN DO BETTER AND WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING BETTER TO PREPARE IN THE FUTURE WHATEVER FOR FUTURE WATER STORAGE IS. ALREADY FROM PROP ONE FUNDS IS NOT GONNA BE COMPLETED IN TWENTY THIRTY. WHAT CAN THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY RIGHT NOW DUE TO STREAMLINED. TO BRING THAT UP MUCH SOONER MAYES TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SB NINE YEARS FROM NOW BEFORE WE HAVE THE FIRST SET OF MONIES FROM PROP ONE TO COMPLETED STORAGE. SO I REALLY THINK WE NEED TO. BE THINKING ABOUT AND CONSIDERING AS A BODY WHAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. IMMEDIATELY NOT AND NINE YEARS FROM NOW. SO CAN YOU IS THERE ANYTHING FROM THE DEED IF YOU ARE THAT. FOR YOU TO. EX EXPEDITE THESE PROJECTS TO COMPLETION THAT WE COULD BE DOING TO HELP YOU. SO I THINK- ONE THING I SHOULD POINT OUT WAS THAT BOND MONEY WAS SPECIFICALLY FOR THE- PUBLIC BENEFITS SHARE THAT THE STATE WAS PROVIDING SELL THOSE PROJECTS REQUIRED ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS BY THE LOCAL PARK- SPONSORS. AND AS WE HAVE SEEN FOR EXAMPLE IN THE CASE OF TEMPERANCE FLYING OUT THE LOCAL SPONSORS FOR- UNABLE TO FIND ADDITIONAL FUNDING SOURCES AND I THINK THAT'S ALSO A CHALLENGE HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR THE SITES RESERVOIR PROJECT AS WELL BECAUSE THE STATE INVESTMENT WAS ONLY INTENDED TO BE FOR A SHARE OF THE PROJECT. THANK YOU IN. TO OUT TO THE PALACE WHO WERE ASKED QUESTIONS- FROM OUR COLLEAGUES JUST MADE THE WOULD LOVE TO GET SOME RESPONSES IN A TIMELY MANNER TO SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS THAT I THINK OF INTEREST TO MANY OTHER MEMBERS IN THE COMMITTEE SO THANK YOU- SOME MEMBER CRISTINA GARCIA. BUT YES THANK YOU MY QUESTION IS FOR. THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD I THINK AS DARREN WHO SPOKE. TO US ABOUT PEOPLE US. ON AND SO WONDERING IF WE HAVE SOME SORT OF INVENTORY OF. HOW BIG THE PROBLEM IS HOW MANY WALLS ARE BEING TURNED OFF AND- THE COST TO. REMEDIATE ARE THOSE LAWS WILL TO BRING IT BACK IN. ABILIFY GLAD SOME- YEAH WE HAVEN'T AND WE HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL WORK WERE STILL AND WE'RE STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION WE DO ON OUR STATE BOARD WEBSITE HAVE A FAST PACED I'M HAPPY TO SEND A LINK TO THE COMMITTEE THAT MAPS ALL OF THE- DETECTIONS THAT WE HAVE AT THE DIFFERENT LEVELS THAT WERE DETECTED OUT OF THE LOCATION OF THOSE WELLS FOR. FULL INFORMATION- BUT HONESTLY WE HAVEN'T EXPLORED THE FULL EDGE OF THE CONTAMINATION SO WE'RE STILL TRYING TO DELINEATE SOME OF THE BOUNDARIES OF THE PLUMES ASSOCIATED WITH IT WE JUST A COUPLE MONTHS AGO ISSUED A ANOTHER ORDER KIND OF OUR BIGGEST HOLE AS IT COMES TO UNDERSTANDING P. BASS AND THAT IS FOR PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM WELLS THAT ARE NEAR AND AROUND A DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE SITES BOTH ACTIVE AND FORMER AND WE WILL START GETTING DATA FROM THEM IN JULY AND AUGUST. AND THEN ALL OF CAN DO QUARTERLY MONITORING LIKE THE OTHER ORDERS WITH ISSUED AROUND THAT- I CAN'T SAY THAT THERE'S BEEN BUT THE MOST IMPACT HAS BEEN IN- SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN ORANGE COUNTY AREA- CORONA YOUR BRAIN- THE END OF SEVERAL OF THE COMMUNITIES IN ORANGE COUNTY WATER DISTRICT AREA SAW EXTENSIVE NUMBERS OF WELLS THAT WERE IMPACTED I BELIEVE MOST OF THOSE COMMUNITIES SWITCHED TO SURFACE WATER FROM METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT TEMPORARILY AND ARE ACTIVELY WORKING WITH PROJECTS TO TRY TO BRING TREATMENT ON TO THEM AND GET THEM. BACK IN PLACE OF SANTA CLARITA ALSO LIKE FIVE OR SIX WELLS IMPACTED SO THERE'S A BEGINNING OF IT I DON'T HAVE OBVIOUSLY A FINAL NUMBER AND WE'RE STILL IN THE IVESTIGATION MODE TO CONTINUE THAT BUT WERE. HAPPY TO SHARE WHAT WE KNOW AT THIS POINT. YEAH I AS WE ARE GOING INTO DROUGHT THE SWELLS ARE BEING. SHUT OFF AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING HARD AS OF THE CALIFORNIA TO BE MUCH MUCH MORE SUSTAINABLE AND RELATE RELY LESS ON THAT IMPORTED WATER- BUT I HAVE A NUMBER OF COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE TURNED OFF. WELLS AND ARE IMPORTING WATER AND CAN'T AFFORD THE INFRASTRUCTURE COST- TO FOR THAT FOR THE CLEAN UP OF THAT PEOPLE'S ON AND IN MY COMMUNITY STILL. REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE RATE PAYERS PAYING FOR THAT REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE INCREASE IN WATER RATES WITH THE IMPORTED WATER- AND JST THE DROUGHT SITUATION THOUGH AND SO I JUST APPRECIATE THE- THAT YOU BROUGHT THAT. FOR TODAY AND I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT THIS OPERATION AND WE HAVE AN INVENTORY OF HOW MANY WALLS ARE CURRENTLY OUT. OF USE BECAUSE A FEW PEOPLE OFF. YEAH THE CHECK AS WE GET MORE DATA ALL THE TIME BUT IT'S ON THE ORDER. OF OVER. AND OVER- TWO HUNDRED WELLS WE NOW HAVE IMPACTS IN THE STATE THAT ARE ABOVE OUR NOTIFICATION LEVELS AND- THIS GRAPHICS ON THE WEB PAGE THAT KEEP THAT UPDATED CURRENTLY SO WE'LL DEFINITELY GET THAT TO YOU. AND YES IT'S A BIG CONCERN WE KNOW IT'S- DOUBLY IMPACTFUL IT IT'S INCREASING RATES AND- IT IS A CONTAMINATION ISSUE THAT. THE WATER SYSTEMS ARE WORKING THROUGH. SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. MISTER BENNETT. THANK YOU I HAVE BOB- THREE COMMENT MORE THAN QUESTIONS OR REQUESTS FOR LONG TERM- ITEMS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE- THE WATERS OURS IN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE AGENCY SAID TO LOOK AT AND ONE IS. IN TWO DIFFERENT PLACES HERE- ON OUR ADAPTIONS TO THE LAST DROUGHT WE MAKE REFERENCE TO- THE GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED AND I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT. THEY HAVE TWENTY YEARS TO. REACH SUSTAINABILITY AND VERY FEW OF THEM ARE MAKING ANY- SIGNIFICANT CUTS- THIS EARLY THEY'RE JUST GETTING THEIR PLANS TOGETHER AND ALMOST ALL OF THEM ARE GOING TO HAVE PLANS TO CALL FOR A VERY SLOW RAMP DOWNS SO WE SHOULDN'T- WE SHOULDN'T EXPECT MUCH IN THE IN TERMS OF THE SHORT RUN- HELP TO COME FROM. GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY PLANS THAT HAVE A TWENTY YEAR CYCLE BEFORE THEY YEAH- ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE REACHED A SUSTAINABILITY IF THEY'RE IF THEY'RE ABLE TO EVEN DO THAT IN TWENTY YEARS. THE SECOND THING IS- IT SEEMS THAT WE HAVE A LACK OF DATA A BALLOT WELLS- AND IT WOULD SEEM THAT. ONE THING I'D LIKE TO ADMINISTRATION TO CONSIDER- AND POTENTIALLY THE LEGISLATURE TO SUPPORT IS FUNDING FOR MONITORING WELLS THAT WOULD GIVE THE STATE- FASTER INFORMATION ABOUT POTENTIALLY HIGH RISK AREAS AREAS NEAR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES LIKE CENTER SO THE STATE COULD GET RAPID. INFORMATION AND WE JUST HAVE LOTS OF AREAS WHERE WE JUST DON'T HAVE A GOOD MONITORING WELLS- THE END SO THAT THAT. WOULD BE THE SECOND AND THEN THE FINAL THING IS. WE SHOULD BE. ARE FOR A STEADY AND MORE SEVERE DROUGHT CYCLES TO COME AND IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT I THINK WE HAVE TO BECOME MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE- ABOUT WHAT WE DO AND I APPRECIATE OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE OF TALK ABOUT STORAGE- I WOULD SUGGEST THAT- THE RECYCLING OF WATER- IS. A VERY RIGHT- AREA AND IT PARTICULARLY IS RIGHT FOR MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS- AND I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE A STATEWIDE PLAN- THAT WOULD ENCOURAGE AND BOTH THE SCIENCE OF THE TECHNOLOGY FOR. THE RECYCLING OF WATER TO DRAMATICALLY DECREASE A MUNICIPAL- AGENCIES RELIANCE ON BOTH IMPORTED WATER AND WATER THAT COMES FROM- GROUNDWATER SUPPLIES- TO THE WE GET MUCH MORE BANG OUT OF THE WATER- THAT WE DO- SPEND AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY TO TRY TO GET INTO OURMUNICIPAL SYSTEMS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER BENNETT WOULD YOU ANY THE PALACE LIKE TO COMMENT ON ANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES. PERSPECTIVES THAT HE'S A SHARK. OKAY THIS IS RACHEL EHLERS FROM LA- JUST ONE COMMENT- IN RESPONSE TO THAT AND IF AND ALSO TO THE COMMENT OF THE VICE CHAIR JUST- WHEN WE THINK ABOUT STORAGE IT'S NOT JUST ABOVE GROUND STORAGE IT'S HISTORICALLY KIND OF HOW WE THOUGHT ABOUT WATER STORAGE BUT IT JUST ENCOURAGING THAT COMMITTEE TO ALSO CONSIDER BELOW GROUND STORAGE- AS AS POTENTIALLY PROJECTS THAT COULD MOVE FASTER THEIR DAIRY MAYBE SMALLER- SO THINKING ABOUT GROUNDWATER RECHARGE CAPTURING FLOOD WATERS- STORM WATER CAPTURE. THINK AS MISTER BENNETT JUST NOTED HOW CAN WE BE AGGRESSIVE AND THINK I THINK MORE CREATIVELY SO REALLY EXPANDING WHEN WE THINK ABOUT WATER STORAGE- AND RESOURCES- THAT THAT'S PROBABLY KIND OF THE NEXT FRONTIER THAT WE SHOULD REALLY BE THINKING ABOUT CRIME MORE SERIOUSLY SO JUST MAKING SURE THAT THAT'S PART OF THE PORTFOLIO YOU'RE CONSIDERING. THANK YOU  GOTHAM QUEBEC FOR OUR PRESENTERS IN ABOUT TWO. IT'S IN THE KIND OF ARENA OF- RESOURCES THAT WAS MENTIONED BY THE ALLEY- IN. HER PRESENTATION THREE POINT FOUR BILLION TO RESPOND TO THE LAST DROP. 7% OF THOSE FUNDS COMING FROM VOTER APPROVED BONDS- AS WE GO INTO THIS DROUGHT- HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE FUNDS THAT ARE AVAILABLE- TO RESPOND TO THE EARLY. SIGNS THAT WE'RE SEEING AND WHETHER OR NOT WE- ARE IN A POSITION. TO ADDRESS WHAT WE CAN FORECAST WOULD- THE DROUGHT DECLARATION THAT'S TAKEN PLACE IN TWO COUNTIES AND- AND POSSIBLY ADDITIONAL COUNTIES BEING ADDED TO THE LIST. BOB THE OTHER COMMENT WOULD BE- AND HOW DO YOU FEEL YOU ALL GET TO- DEPLOY AND IMPLEMENT- THESE- POLICIES REGULATIONS OR FOR THAT MATTER. OVERSEE THESE INVESTMENTS ON HARD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. WHEN YOU SEE US MOVING THE NEEDLE ON- YOU KNOW PER PREPARING AND- ADDRESSING KIND OF THE CURRENT NEED AT THE MOMENT. AND AND LASTLY I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW IF- YOU ALL YOUR AGENCIES. ARE WEIGHING IN AS THE MAY REVISED BUDGET IS BEING PUT TOGETHER- AND WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR AND I SEE WE YOU US- FOR PURPOSES OF ONE TIME INVESTMENT WITH. THE SURPLUSES THAT WERE SEEN HERE IN THE STATE OR- A LINING- WITH THE FUNDS THAT ARE COMING FROM. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- TO- TACKLE THE INITIAL PHASE OF THIS TRIAL TO AVOID ANOTHER SEC THREE QUESTIONS I WANT. ANY OF THE PANELISTS- CAN. TRY TO. ADDRESS THAT PLEASE. WELL ON ALL TAKE A US THAT I THINK- VISITORS MADE A- POINT IN HER. OPENING REMARKS ABOUT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN SHORT TERM DROUGHT RESPONSE PROJECT AND THE LARGE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THAT TAKE LONGER TO PUT INTO PLACE THE NATURE OF THOSE LARGE PROJECTS IS SUCH THAT. IT YOU KNOW THEY CAN BE ON A- FOUR YEAR FIVE YEAR TEN YEAR PLANNING HORIZON- HOPEFULLY MUCH LONGER THAN THE- SPAN OF OUR NEXT DROUGHT. YET THEY ARE VERY IMPORTANT IN THE LONG TERM BECAUSE WE EXPECT CALIFORNIA TO BE FACING A FUTURE IN WHICH WE SEE THE EFFECTS OF A WARMING CLIMATE AND CONSEQUENTLY- A GREATER RISK OF WATER SCARCITY. SO YOU'RE TURNING TO THE THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE IN THE SHORT TERM THE NEAR TERM. THE CERTAINLY- OF MUCH OF THAT IS THE DATA AND FORECASTING AREA AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE SOME IDEAS OF WHAT CAN BE IMPROVED THERE AND ALSO IN THE NEAR TERM ASSISTANCE TO US SMALL WATER SYSTEMS. THAT DOES TEND TO STRUGGLE DURING DROUGHT THE- SAFER PROGRAM THAT THE LEDGER LEGISLATURE AUTHORIZED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO IS A GREAT STEP FORWARD IN THAT REGARD- AS ARE SOME OF THE- RECOMMENDATIONS FOR. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND OTHER DIRECT ASSISTANCE THAT WE HAVE IN OUR REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON THE DROUGHT VULNERABILITY OF SMALL HANDOUT RURAL COMMUNITIES. SO I THINK WE CERTAINLY HAVE SOME PASSED FORWARD TO BE GOING DOWN AND IN OF THE RISK OF DROUGHT IS NOT GOING TO GO AWAY IF ANYTHING WE WOULD EXPECT- PROBABLY. A WORSENING IN THE LONG TERM FUTURE. ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO THE TAKE A STAB AT THE- THE QUESTIONS. SURE I CAN READ IN THE SIGNATURE DOUBLE THE PARK THIS WHILE I'VE- YOU KNOW AS I MENTIONED WE ARE WE'RE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN IN STARTING CONVERSATIONS WE DEVELOP WITCHY RETURN EARLY TO START. TALKING ABOUT IT AND REGULARLY COMMUNICATING ON ISSUES WE'RE SEEING ACROSS THE STATE WE'VE FAR START SOME CONVERSATIONS IN THE RUSSIAN- WE'RE WORKING WITH THE WATER BOARD ANOTHER SHOULD BE CHANGED TO BEGIN CONVERSATIONS ARE SORT OF LAST TIME TO START LOOKING AT. PARTNERSHIPS WE CAN CREATE ABOUT HOW IN TRYING TO ENSURE FLOWS CAN BE MODIFIED OR OR JUST TO INSURE PROTECTION THE SPECIES WERE MONITORING SOME STRINGS ALREADY FOR- FISH STRANDING- DUE. TO LOW FLOW CONDITIONS. RIGHT ON THE HATCHERY AS WE TALKED ABOUT IT THE TRUCK BECAUSE FISH SO. WE ARE ACTIVELY. I WOULD NEVER SAY WERE TOTALLY PREPARED BECAUSE WE NEVER KNOW REALLY WHERE WE'RE GOING. BUT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN BASED ON WHAT WE LEARN- IN THE RECENT PAST TO PREPARE OURSELVES FOR WHAT'S AHEAD OF US AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN RESPOND TO THAT WE ARE RESPONDING. AND WORKING WITH ALL THE PARTIES AND WE NEED TO AS WE CONTINUE TO LEARN MORE MORE ABOUT SO HOW DARBY MAY OR MAY NOT BE MOVING INTO THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS OF POTENTIALLY THE NEXT YEAR. MISTER CHAIR AYE AYE DODD- YOUR QUESTIONS AS WELL FOCUSING ON. DRINKING WATER ASPECTS. THAT I DO FEEL LIKE WE'RE MOVING THE NEEDLE THE- GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE DID PASS THE SAVE A FORMAL DRINKING WATER ACT AND BROUGHT. ON OUR SUPER PROGRAM AS MICELLAR MENTIONED- THERE'S A LOT OF WORK REALLY STARTING UP THERE. THE SMALLER WATER SYSTEMS ARE THE ONE THAT ARE IMPACTED AS MICELLAR MENTION AS WELL. AND WE'RE REALLY WORKING HARD TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- ADDRESS THAT. A LOT OF THAT WILL BE COMBINING WATER SYSTEMS OF THE- THE AGE OF A SMALL INDEPENDENT LITTLE WATER SYSTEM WITH ONE WHILE SURVIVING THE DROUGHT. IS PROBABLY A THING OF THE PAST AND HOW WE HARDEN THEM AND PREPARE THOSE COMMUNITIES FOR. THEIR FUTURE IS- IMPORTANT WE'RE WORKING REALLY HARD IN THAT AREA- TO MOVE THAT FORWARD. IT DID REALLY GET ASKED ALL THROUGHOUT AS WELL OUR DEPARTMENT AND MY GROUP IS WORKING ON DIRECT POTABLE REUSE FOR RECYCLED WATER REGULATIONS. THAT'LL BE NEW IN CALIFORNIA AND SEVERAL OF OUR LARGE WATER AGENCIES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND EVENTUALLY NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WILL CONSIDER. HOW TO BRING THAT ONLINE AND FURTHER TAKE ADVANTAGE OF- RECYCLING IN THE STATE. IN THE LAST DROUGHT THERE WAS- EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AT THE BOARD OFFERED AT A 1% LOAN INTEREST RATE THAT WAS SNAPPED UP AND- ALL THOSE PROJECTS ARE NOT COMPLETED IN CONTRIBUTING. TO THE WATER SUPPLY IN CALIFORNIA SO WE CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS BUT- HISTORICALLY THE INVESTMENT IN WATER INFRASTRUCTURE. HAS BEEN UNDERFUNDED NATIONALLY AND IN CALIFORNIA'S NO DIFFERENT. IN THAT REGARD AND THERE'S MUCH MORE WORK TO DO. I THANK YOU. I'VE GOT THAT TO MARK. ONE IN THE AREA OF THE WATER RESTRICTIONS AT THAT SOME POINT ANOTHER. ARE BROUGHT UP UPON YOU KNOW OUR WATER AGENCIES ARE CITIES- AG INDUSTRY. CURIOUS TO KNOW- IF WE ARE PREPARED- AS IT COMES TO- IMPOSING THESE RESTRICTIONS- REQUIRED PERMITTING WATER CHANGES A- NEW WATER RIGHT KIND OF RECONFIGURATION. TO DO- JUST THAT IT'S A LONG PROCESS- ARE WE DOING ANYTHING WITHIN THE AGENCIES THAT CAN HELP US MOVE IT IN A MUCH MORE EXPEDITIOUS MANNER- TO TRY TO COMPLY WITH THOSE- WATER RESTRICTIONS THAT WE BEGIN TO. IMPOSE ACROSS THE BOARD ON INDUSTRIES- MUNICIPALITIES AND OTHER. ENTITIES IS THERE SOMETHING THAT WE'RE ALREADY LOOKING AT A TO HELP US- POSITION OURSELVES TO BE MORE EFFICIENT AT WHEN IT COMES TO THOSE RESTRICTIONS. THIS IS- ERICA DOG JUMPED IN IN- MAYBE OTHERS CAN JOIN AS WELL- OF CERTAINTY FROM THE WATER RIGHTS PERSPECTIVE AND- REFERENCE THAT- CURTAILMENTS THAT WE DID BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY FIFTEEN. WE DID HAVE A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES IN IMPLEMENTING THOSE. CURTAILMENTS AT THAT TIME- IN TWENTY FOURTEEN IN PARTICULAR- UP UNTIL THAT POINT THE WATER RATES YOU STATE OR DEMAND DATA WAS ONLYREPORTED EVERY THREE YEARS. AND SO IT WAS HARD TO GET AN ASSESSMENT OF KIND OF WHAT. WAS A REAL TIME DATA WAS. LOOKING LIKE THERE WERE LEGISLATIVE CHANGES IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THAT REQUIRE PEOPLE TO REPORT THEIR WATER USE EVERY YEAR AND THAT HAS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED- HOW OFTEN WE GET THAT DATA BUT EVEN STILL THE TIME WHEN SUPPORT AS I MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT ONCE EVERY EIGHTEEN. MONTHS IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES AND SO THAT'S GOING TO LEAD TO THE ON GOING CHALLENGES JUST MAKING SURE WE HAVE ACCURATE UP TO DATE DATA. BUT GIVEN THE IDEA THAT WE DO HAVE WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO COORDINATE IT AND TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT DATA IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND SO JUST IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS THE DIVISION RELEASED A SUPPLY DEMAND VISUALIZATION TOOL WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY GO ONLINE AND SEE- CAMP WITHIN A CERTAIN WATERSHED THAT DEMAND BASED ON. WHO'S REPORTED WHAT WATER USE IN THE PAST AND PROJECTED SUPPLY BASED ON SOME INFORMATION FROM OUR SISTER AGENCIES AND THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT STEP FORWARD. THE PURPOSE OF THAT IS TO PROVIDE SOME OF THAT INFORMATION EARLIER AND MORE OFTEN SO THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHEN WE ARE DRY CONDITION WHAT DO YOU SUPPLY DEMAND CONDITIONS LOOK LIKE IN ARE WE HEADING TOWARDS A POTENTIAL- NEED FOR CURTAILMENT SCORER NOTICES THAT THERE ISN'T SUFFICIENT. SUPPLY RELATIVE TO DEMAND- THERE WAS ALSO I THINK- I'D IT TO ENSURE THE QUESTIONS REFER TO SOME OF THE- BEEN WATER CONSERVATION REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE IN PLACE THROUGH TWENTY SIXTEEN- IN. SINCE THAT TIME THERE WAS LEGISLATION PASSED THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION AS A WAY OF LIFE LEGISLATION. THAT CAN REFOCUS IS THE- PROCS INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT MANDATORY CUTBACKS WITHIN THE FOUR HUNDRED LARGEST URBAN WATER AGENCIES- THE INNOVATIVE CAN'T MANDATORY CONSERVATION REQUIREMENTS INSTEAD WE'RE PIVOTING TOWARDS EFFICIENCY AND INCORPORATING. THE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCE AND KIND OF THE MICROCLIMATES ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA SO THAT THE WATER USE WITHIN ANY PARTICULAR AREA. IT REALLY REFLECTS WHAT THE GEOGRAPHY IS LIKE WHAT THE CLIMATE IS LIKE AND THAT LEGISLATION IS IN ITS PROCESS OF KIND OF WORKING ITS WAY THROUGH THE- THE IMPLEMENTATION STEPS THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. IS CONDUCTING SOME TECHNICAL ANALYSIS NOW AND IT WILL REFER THAT INFORMATION TO THE STATE WATER BOARD I THINK THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO AT WHICH POINT THE BOARD WILL LOOK AT THAT INFORMATION AND ADOPT REGULATIONS TO A KIND OF PERMANENTLY IN TRYING SOME OF THESE EFFICIENCY REQUIREMENTS STATEWIDE. SO AGAIN THERE WE'VE LEARNED I THINK A TREMENDOUS ABOUT SINCE LAST DROUGHT AND ARE BETTER POSITIONED MOVING FORWARD. FIVE I THINK I'LL LEAVE IT THERE AND ENTERED A TO MICHAEL. OKAY THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOLLOW UP COMMENTS BY THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU GET- PAL NUMBER TWO WE WILL BE FOLLOWING UP WITH YOU AS IT RELATES TO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WENT. UNANSWERED AND- TRY TO GET THOSE- QUESTIONS RESPONDED TO IN A TIMELY MANNER THANK YOU AND I HOPE THAT YOU WILL STICK AROUND. AS WE HAVE OUR THIRD PANEL THAT WILL BE SPEAKING AND PERHAPS ANY QUESTIONS THAT MAY ARISE AT THE BACK TO YOU ALL THANK YOU AGAIN THEIR PANEL IS- HOW DROUGHT IMPACTS REGION'S DIFFERENTLY WE HAVE A NUMBER OF SPEAKERS HERE'S WELL DAVID ROBINSON- MY- COUNTY SUPERVISOR AS ANIMAL WATER. DIRECTORS SASSANID THEN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND CO FOUNDER OF COMMUNITY WATER CENTER THAT WILL BE SENIOR ATTORNEY WATER PROGRAM NOT TO RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL JOE DEL BOSQUE IT DOUBLES GIVE FARMS CENTER CURLED GENERAL MANAGER. THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY WATER AUTHORITY IF- FIRST PRESENTERS. READING PLEASE- PLEASE PROCEED. RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AT CHARTER C. N. THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR ALLOWING ME. ON THE COUNTY SUPERVISOR AND AS SUCH I'M A DIRECTOR FOR THE SONOMA COUNTY WATER AGENCY ALSO KNOWN AS CINEMA WATER. SO NUMBER WATER IS A SPECIAL DISTRICT OUR CORE FUNCTION IS TO PROVIDE DRINKING WATER TO APPROXIMATELY SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE AND- SILVA AND RATE COUNTIES. WE ARE A WHOLESALE PROVIDER OF WATER TO CITIES AND WATER DISTRICTS. WATER COMES FROM THE RUSSIAN RIVER WATERSHED SYSTEM AND WE RELY ON TO RESERVOIRS MENDOCINO. AND LAKE CINEMA. BOTH OF WHICH WE JOINTLY MANAGE WITH THE UNITED STATES ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS OBVIOUSLY WE MANAGE IT FOR WATER SUPPLY WELL THE COR MANAGES. DURING THE WINTER MONTHS FOR FLOOD CONTROL. OF NOTE THE SYSTEM IS BASICALLY SELF CONTAINED IN WE ARE NOT CONNECTED TO ANY PART OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT OR THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT. WE ALSO HAVE THREE GROUNDWATER BASINS UNDER THE AUSPICES OF SIGMA HERE IN CINEMA COUNTY I ACTUALLY SERVE ON TWO OF THOSE THREE GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES AND WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS IN THAT REGARD. CINEMA COUNTY IS MOSTLY WORLD BEYOND- THE ONE ON ONE CORRIDOR. IN OUR ECONOMY IS BASED IN AGRICULTURE IT'S BASED ON TOURISM AND RECREATION AS WELL. IT OF COURSE RAINFALL MEANS EVERYTHING TO OUR REGION'S WATER SUPPLY AND THUS FAR ECONOMY. OBVIOUSLY IT FEELS OUR RESERVOIRS OF REPLENISHES OUR GROUNDWATER IT PROVIDES WATER FOR LIVESTOCK AND CROP IRRIGATION WATER FOR ENDANGERED FISH. WATER FOR RECREATION IN OUR ENVIRONMENT AND FORTUNATELY OR UNFORTUNATELY. WATER FOR FIREFIGHTING EFFORTS. WORST DROUGHT ON RECORD IN OUR AREA WAS IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN BACK WHEN I WAS IN HIG SCHOOL- THAT WINTER IN COLORADO WE'RE WITNESSING IT WAS LOCATED RECEIVE JUST OVER SIXTEEN INCHES OF RAINFALL. AS OPPOSED TO THE USUAL- RAINFALL OF ABOUT THIRTY SEVEN INCHES. ARE FOR COMPARISON THIS YEAR IN COLORADO HAS RECEIVED JUST A TAD OVER THIRTEEN INCHES SOULFUL THREE INCHES LESS. THAN THE WORST DROUGHT YEAR OF RECORD. AS A RESULT LAKE MENDOCINO IS AT 43% OF CAPACITY WITH LESS THAN THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND TOTAL ACRE FEET. THAT'S THE LOWEST STORAGE LEVEL EVER AT THIS TIME OF YEAR IN THAT PARTICULAR LAKE. OUR SECOND RESERVOIR LIKE CINEMA IS ABOUT 61% OF CAPACITY AND THAT RAINFALL THAT FEEDS THAT LAKE WAS NOT QUITE THIRTEEN INCHES. THAT RESERVOIR IS AS LOW AS IT HAS EVER BEEN AT THIS TIME OF YEAR AS WELL. IN WHILE PERHAPS NOT QUITE AS DIRE WE HAD SIMILAR CONDITIONS DURING THE DROUGHT OF TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN. BUT THANKFULLY WE LEARNED SOME LESSONS AND DOUBLE DOWN ON PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING CONSERVATION AND RESILIENCY PRACTICES AND PROGRAMS WHICH REALLY ARE STARTING TO PAY OFF. IN EARLY TWENTY TWENTIES CINEMA WATER FILED A TEMPORARY URGENCY CHANGE PETITION. TO PRESERVE WATER IN LAKE MENDOCINO THAT ACTION HAS SAVED OVER TEN THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF WATER WITHIN THE LAKE THROUGH THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY. SO WHILE THE pSHOULD BE WORSE. HAD WE NOT TAKEN THAT ACTION THAT WE ALSO IMPLEMENTE A PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT CAMPAIGN GETTING THE WORD OUT TO OUR COMMUNITY. I THINK OF NOTE ARE PER CAPITA WATER USE IS DOWN ABOUT 31% OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS OR SO. AND WE USE THAT TO SPREAD THE WORD TO USE WATER WISELY AND TREATED AS PRECIOUS AS IT IS. IN THIS YEAR'S NUMBER WATER FILED ANOTHER. TEMPORARY URGENCY CHANGE ORDER TO REDUCE WATER RELEASES FROM LAKE MENDOCINO. THIS PETITION WAS APPROVED BY THE STATE WATER. RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD AS WELL. SO WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN OUR FLOWS IN RUSSIAN- FOR ENDANGERED SALMON AND STEELHEAD THAT RUN THE RIVER FOR OUR OWN DRINKING WATER SUPPLY THE HEALTH OF THE RIVER AND ALL THAT FLOWS FROM IT INCLUDING RECREATION. AS YOU DON'T GOVERNOR NEWSOM STOOD ON THE BIG LAKE BED OF LAKE MENDOCINO JUST A COUPLE WEEKS BACK AND PROCLAIM TO DROUGHT EMERGENCY FOR. MEDICINAL AND SNOW COUNTIES. WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE PROCLAMATION AND WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR STATE LOCAL PARTNERS USING EVERY TOOL MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE DECLARATION TO ENSURE WATER AVAILABILITY. AND TO PROTECT OUR WATERSHEDS HEALTH AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IN THESE CHALLENGING TIMES. I WANT TO INTRODUCE TO YOU IF YOU AREN'T ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH THE PROGRAM WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON- AND WE'VE ALREADY SEEN SOME BENEFIT FROM. I HEARD THE COMMENTS- IN QUESTIONS ON STORAGE AND THIS IS A PROJECT PROJECT AND I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT AS A DIRECTOR OF THE WATER AGENCIES CALL FORECAST INFORMED RESERVOIR OPERATIONS- OR PHARAOH. IF YOU WILL. IT'S USING THE BEST DATA AVAILABLE TO MANAGE WATER STORAGE IN RESERVOIRS. IT'S BEST TOLD REALLY I THINK BY GOING BACK TO ITS INCEPTION. SO IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN THE LAST DROUGHT THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED. LIKE MENACING OF WATER LEVEL WAS NOT CLOSE TO CAPACITY. BUT THE U. S. ARMY CORPS AGAIN WHO MANAGES RESERVOIR FOR FLOOD CONTROL REFERRED TO A DIDN'T RULE BOOK FOR NEARLY FIFTY YEARS AGO. WHICH SAID IN ESSENCE IF THE WATER LEVEL IS AT THIS ELEVATION AND THE STORM IS COMING. YOU RELEASED THE WATER. MAKES SENSE IN THEORY- BUT WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT RAIN NEVER FOLLOWED. AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ACRE FEET OF WATER WAS LOST. AND THAT PARTICULAR YEAR WE NEVER REALLY RECOVERED. WE STARTED WORKING WITH THE SCRIPTS INSTITUTE OF OCEANOGRAPHY CENTER FOR WESTERN WEATHER AND WATER EXTREMES AS WELL AS G. W. ARE. NO LONGER AND THE WEATHER SERVICE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND FORECASTING AND PRECIPITATION AS STORMS FROM IN ACROSS THE PACIFIC. WHAT WE DISCOVERED IS THESE NARROW BANDS OF MOISTURE THAT HIT OUR WATERSHED WE NOW WE NOW ALL KNOW THEM AS ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS. THEY DO ACCOUNT 450% OF THE STATE'S PRECIPITATION IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO A FEW STORMS A YEAR THAT DETERMINE IF WE HAVE A DRY AN AVERAGE OR WHAT YEAR. IN IF YOU ARE MANAGING A RESERVOIR. YOU WANT TO KNOW IF THE ATMOSPHERE IS GOING TO HIT YOUR WATERSHED OR MISS. MANY TIMES A FEW MILES EITHER WAY CAN MAKE OR BREAK IN OUR WATER YEAR. SO AGAIN WORKING WITH SCRIPTS WITH OUR PARTNERS AT THE STATE- RESEARCH WAS DONE TO REALLY TRY TO TRACK. ALL THESE ATMOSPHERIC. RIVERS ARE PERFORMED IN WHAT WE CAN TAKE FROM THATSO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE THAT RULE BOOK TO BE A LITTLE MORE CONSERVATIVE AND RELEASING WATER- OUR PARTNERSHIP BEGAN FLYING RECON MISSIONS OUT OVER THE PACIFIC OCEAN TO TRACK THE ROUTES IN INTENSITY THE ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS- I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL THAT IN THAT PARTICULAR YEAR WITH THE- WITH WORKING WITH THEN SENATOR MARTY BLOCK. PASSED SB SEVEN FIFTY EIGHT IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND CREATED THE ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS RESEARCH MITIGATION AND CLIMATE FORECASTING- PROGRAM. AND THANKS TO SUBSEQUENT APPROPRIATIONS THAT PROGRAM WE'RE ABLE TO CONDUCT A PILOT PROGRAM AT LAKE MENDOCINO WORKING WITH THE ARMY CORPS TO CHESTER RESEARCH AND THEORIES. AND USE A DEVIATION TO HOLD BACK WATER INTO THE FLOOD POOL. THAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN RELEASED- THE RESULT IS ABOUT ELEVEN THOUSAND ACRE FEET- THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER. TO ME THIS IS VERY EXCITING- THIS IS WHERE- IF WE CAN IMPROVE THE STORAGE CAPACITY OF EACH AND EVERY RESERVOIR IN THE STATE- BY. SOME PERCENTAGE POINT OF. MAYBE FIVE MAYBE UP 210% THAT WOULD BE A GREAT MOVE FORWARD I THINK IN TERMS OF TRULY MANAGING OUR WATER SUPPLY WITH THIS VOLATILE WEATHER PATTERNS THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING. WE PUBLISHED INITIAL VIABILITY ASSESSMENT THAT SHOWS FORECAST INFORMED RESERVOIR OPERATIONS- DO WORK. IN CINEMA WATER IS NOT THE ONLY WATER AGENCY INVESTING IN EUROPE AT WE BUILT A COALITION. AND THAT WE HAVE SUPPORT FROM THAT EFFORT THAT INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING- SAN DIEGO COUNTY ORANGE COUNTY IRVINE RANCH TURLOCK YUBA AND SANTA CLARA. AND IN ORDER TO EXPAND UPON THE PROMISE OF VERO WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO FIND IT E. W. R. PROGRAM AND PILOT DEVIATIONS AT OTHER RESERVOIRS. THE ATMOSPHERIC RIVER RESEARCH CREATES THE FORECAST THAT'S THE F. IN VERO AND WITHOUT THAT ATMOSPHERIC RIVER RESEARCH FUNDING. THERE REALLY IS NO PHARAOH. AND FOR MY WATER AGENCY WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO APPLY THAT HAD WE BEEN ABLE TO APPLY FOR. LAKES NANA WE COULD SAVE EVEN MORE WATER AND CRITICALLY NEEDED AT THIS MOMENT. I THANK GOD THIS IS A REALLY EXCITING PROGRAM THAT HAS GREAT POTENTIAL TO REALLY BE A GAME CHANGER WATER MANAGEMENT THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND IT REALLY DOES DEPEND ON SOME STABLE FUNDING TO BE W. OURS ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS PROGRAM. I THINK IT'S AN INVESTMENT AND- IN THE FUTURE AS WE MANAGE THROUGH THESE DROUGHTS THAT ARE COMING ALL TOO OFTEN. I WILL SAY IN THE SAME VEIN IS ZERO THE WATER AGENCY IS WORKING AGAIN WITH SCRIPTS. HYLARANA STATE UNIVERSITY GW ARE AGAIN A GREAT PARTNER. IN FLOOD CONTROL AND WATER AGENCIES PARTNERS AROUND THE BAY AREA I'M WHAT WE CALL. THE ADVANCED QUANTITATIVE PRECIPITATION INFORMATION. IT'S A MOUTHFUL- BUT THE ACRONYM IS- BASICALLY AQ PI. IT'S NOT REALLY MUCH BETTER AS AN ACRONYM BUT- IT REALLY IS- ABOUT USING ADVANCED RADAR TECHNOLOGY TO FORECAST AGAIN THE PRECIPITATION THAT COMES IN ACROSS THE PACIFIC. R. AS I UNDERSTAND IT A LOT OF OUR- RADAR SYSTEMS THROUGHOUT FOR WEATHER FORECASTING DON'T HAVE THE FINE GRAIN DETAIL THAT ONE NEEDS TO REALLY- GET THE INFORMATION NEEDED. THAT SET AT THE SCALE- THAT YOU NEED TO REALLY PUT INTO WORK ON TO CHANGE THE WORLD BOOKS TO CHANGE THE WAY THE RESERVOIRS ARE MANAGED- AND- THESE THESE RADAR SYSTEMS WILL HELP US DO THAT. SO WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THAT AS WELL WE THINK THAT IT'S ALL ON WORKING TOGETHER TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW THESE STORMS ARE GONNA HIT WHERE THE CAR HIT HOW MUCH PRECIPITATION IS GOING TO FALL. WHETHER IT'S IN THE WAERSHED OR NOT AND THEN WHAT YOU DO WITH THE RESERVOIR- AS YOU PREPARE FOR IT BUILDING AFTER THOSE STORMS- SO IT WORKS IN CONCERT WITH GIRL IT COULD BE I GUESS. ON AGAIN BETTER PINPOINTING- IN BETTER MANAGEMENT. THE OTHER THING THAT WE'VE DONE- BESIDES THESE REALLY HIGH TECH VERSIONS OF THINGS AND SOME OF THE REALLY DOWN AND DIRTY THINGS THAT ONE DOES- DURING DROUGHTS- WE HAD A DROUGHT DRIVE UP. A DROUGHT DRIVE UP TO REALLY JUST THAT ON THINK OF- COATED- YOU KNOW VACCINES ARE TESTING. IT'S REALLY HAVING PEOPLE DRIVE UP AND GET A PACKAGE OF- TOOL KITS THAT INCLUDE WATER SVING DEVICES FOR IMMEDIATE WATER CONSERVATION NEEDS DURING THE DROUGHT. LIKE SHOWER HEADS AND TOILETS DONNA TABS TO CHECK FOR LEAKS. SHOWER BUCKETS HOSE NOZZLES EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS ITS REALLY GETTING THE WORD OUT. IN A WAY THAT- WE FOUND TO BE VERY SUCCESSFUL- WE THINK WE WOULD LIKE TO IT WORKS WELL IN URBANIZED AREAS QUITE FRANKLY AND WE WOULD LIKE TO EXPAND THIS. A BUT OF COURSE THAT TAKES US SOME FUNDING AS WELL AND WE DO THINK- WE'VE- HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS. ON BY HAVING THESE. DROP POP UPS THEY BECOME- KNOWN ON THE NEWS AND GETS THE WORD OUT. I BELIEVE IN A MUCH MUCH BETTER WAY. AND I CAN TELL YOU THIS FROM WHERE I SIT IN MY DISTRICT HERE IN THE SOUTHERN END OF CINEMA COUNTY AGRICULTURE IS ONE OF OUR ECONOMIC DRIVERS. RATES IN OUR REGION- VALUED AT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX MILLION LAST YEAR THAT'S ONLY ABOUT HALF OF WHAT IT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN. WE HAVE A LOT OF FIRE DAMAGE LAST YEAR AND SMOKE DAMAGE- FROM THE WILDFIRES- FOLLOWING GRAPES MILK PRODUCTION WAS VALUED IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN AT ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN MILLION. LIVESTOCK AND POULTRY- ALSO ARE BIG AND SONOMA COUNTY. THE SEVERE DROUGHT CONDITIONS ARE IMPACTING RIGHT NOW- IF YOU'RE DISHING FOR CROPS AND WATER LIVESTOCK. WATER FOR LIVESTOCK AND FEED AND I COULD TELL YOU THAT THE- THERE ARE WATER HAULING PROGRAMS ALREADY UNDERWAY- FOR AREAS WEST OF WHERE I LIVE HERE IN PETALUMA- FOR RANCHES ACT HAVE. RUN DRY OR THEIR AG PLANS ARE NOW DRY. AND OF COURSE IT'S ONLY ON THE FIFTH OF MAY GOING FORWARD SO IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG DRY YEAR. WE'RE HOPEFUL- THAT WE HAVE A REPRIEVE FROM WILDFIRES THIS YEAR BUT AGAIN WE ALL KNOW- WE'RE- YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE FACING. I KNOW OF PERSONALLY I CAN TELL YOU MY SONS- CALIFORNIA FIREFIGHTER- WAS THAT A COUPLE FIRES UP IN LAKE COUNTY. LAST WEEK AND SAID THE MOISTURE CONTENT ON AT MAY FIRST WAS ABOUT WHAT IT SHOULD BE AND AUGUST FIRST SO WE ARE ALREADY AND- I DIRE SITUATION THERE- ON THE AGRICULTURE FRONT AGAIN- RANCHERS HAVE. BEEN FACING TOUGH DECISIONS THEY'VE BEEN CALLING THEIR HERDS THEY'VE BEEN SELLING THEIR HERDS TRANSFERRING THEIR HERDS TRYING TO FIND ALTERNATE SOURCES OF WATER- OUR ON FARM BUREAU HERE HAS BEEN WORKING WITH- WITH THEM- TO DO WHAT WE CAN AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM AS WELL TO. MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THEM AS THEY GO FORWARD THROUGH THIS. DIFFICULT TIME. THERE'S ALSO BEEN A SIGNIFICANT- DECREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF RECLAIMED WATER SOMETHING THAT WE'VE REALLY BEEN WORKING ON HERE IT'S NOT MY COUNTY AND WITH THE OTHER COUNTY ARE MARIN COUNTY. AS WELL AS NAPA- IN KIND OF A LARGER- WATERSHED APPROACH TO RECYCLED WATER. IN MAKING IT AVAILABLE FOR OUR AGRICULTURAL- OF PARTNERS INCLUDING FOR FROST PROTECTION. ON THE GREAT FINDS WHICH IS A- A VERY GOOD USE FOR THIS WATER AS WELL AS- PASTURE AND HAY CROP IRRIGATION. IT'S THAT THOUGH IS AMPLIFYING THE CHALLENGE OF WATER SCARCITY AGAIN. HAVING A- NOT HAVING AS MUCH RECYCLED WATER AS WE WOULD LIKE- YOU KNOW THE EDMONSON RESERVOIRS OF ALSO BEEN CRUCIAL FOR FIGHTING FIRES. AND WE'RE SEEING THESE WATER SOURCES ARE QUICKLY DRYING UP- AND- WE WORRY ABOUT THAT AS THIS YEAR GOES ON AND AS THE WEATHER BECOMES WARMER GOING FORWARD. I THINK- OBVIOUSLY THAT FARMERS ARE CONDUCTING STEPS ARE READY THEY ARE REALLY HAVE THEIR NOSE TO THE GRINDSTONE AND UNDERSTAND THEIR- WHAT IT TAKES TO SURVIVE BUT AT THE END THE DAY WE NEED WATER TO FALL FROM THE SKY AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TREATING IT AS PRECIOUS AS IT IS- WE NEED IMMEDIATE DROUGHT RELIEF FUNDING TO SUPPORT AGRICULTURE QUITE FRANKLY IN THIS COUNTY- AND THAT INCLUDES PROJECTS TO JUMPSTART GROUNDWATER RECHARGE. REALLY THE INSTALLATION OF LINERS IN OUR AREA- AREA PONDS AND RESERVOIRS THAT'LL HELP WOMEN THAT GROUNDWATER OR THE AMOUNT OF WATER LOST TO ABSORPTION AND ALLOW FOR LONGER STORAGE TIME CAPACITY WHEN MACHINES TO COMBAT FROST AS OPPOSED TO USING WATER- WOULD BE A GOOD THING SOIL MOISTURE PROBES TO EFFICIENTLY MANAGE IRRIGATION NEEDS EFFICIENT STORAGE OF OFFSITE AND ONSITE WATER. IN THE WAY WE LOOK AT THESE THINGS THAT THERE'S A THE SHORT TERM IMMEDIATE NEED TO KEEP THE BUSINESSES UP AND GOING THROUGH THE SUMMER MONTHS THERE'S A LONGER TERM INVESTMENTS THAT NEED TO BE MADE TO REALLY PROVIDE THE RESILIENCY NEEDED TO SURVIVE- THIS VERY FLASHY SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE WORDS- EITHER IS SEEMINGLY IN A DROUGHT YEAR OR FLOOD YEAR AND NOTHING IN BETWEEN. SO WE JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE IN. IN IN RESILIENCY GOING FORWARD. I THINK THE FINAL TOPIC I WANTED ON IS HOW THE DROUGHT IMPACTS THE HEALTH OF OUR WATERSHED AND AGAIN INCREASES THE FIRE DANGER. AND I DON'T THINK I NEED TO TELL YOU- HOUSE CINEMA COUNTY HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY WILDFIRES- STARTING IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WITH TUBBS AND NUNS FIRES FOLLOWED IN BY THE CAN GET FIRED IN TWO THOUSAND AND- NINETEEN. AND THEN JUST LAST YEAR WE WERE HIT WITH THE ALLEN YOU COMPLEX- THESE FIRES HAVE WREAKED HAVOC ON OUR COMMUNITIES I CAN TELL YOU THAT- THERE IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PTSD. AND THE COMMUNITY AS WELL- BUT IT'S ALSO RECOUNTED ON A WATERSHED. THE ASHLEY DEBRIS OFFLOAD THE RUSSIAN RIVER IMPACTING THE QUALITY OF THE WATER. PLACING FURTHER STRAIN ON THE DEPENDED FISH ANDWILDLIFE SPECIES ARE PARTNERS IN THE AND THE AGENCY HAS. DONE A GREAT JOB I BELIEVE. IN TERMS OF GETTING OUT THERE RIGHT AWAY RIGHT AWAY- POSE FIRE BURNING UP THE STRAW WATTLES DOING ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO DO AND DO REALLY WELL. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY- LANDSCAPE IS UP. IT'S BEEN REALLY CHARRED. AND IT IN- IN A NEGATIVE IMPACT IS- IS CREATED. THAT'S REALLY HARD TO OVERCOME. SO WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE INVESTMENTS THE STATE HAS ALREADY MADE TO ADDRESS WILD FIRE RESCUE IN WEIRD COURAGE BY THE PROSPECT OF. ADDITIONAL FUNDING THIS YEAR TO RESTORE THE FOREST HEALTH AND REDUCE. WILDFIRE RISK EVEN MORE SO- BUT WE KNOW THAT THAT ALSO NEEDS TO BE SUSTAIN FOR THE LONG TERM. I IN OUR COUNTY WE PUT A- TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT THAT WERE REALLY THINKING UP IS- HOPEFULLY GOING TO BE LEVERAGED- TO REALLY HAVE- KIND OF THAT LANDSCAPE SCALE APPROACH. TO REALLY FIGURE OUT WHAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE SURE THAT EACH AND EVERY YEAR WE'RE NOT FACED WITH THE WILDFIRE RISKS THAT WE HAVE BEEN- DROUGHTS OBVIOUSLY PLAY A HUGE ROLE IN THAT. WE BELIEVE THAT SOME OF THOSE EARLIER FIRES I MENTIONED. ARE WERE THE DIRECT RESULT OF THE DAMAGE THAT WAS DONE DURING THE DROUGHT OF TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. A LOT OF TREES OUT THERE WERE- WERE KILLED BECAUSE OF THAT DROUGHT. AND THEY WERE LEFT TO BURN- WHEN THOSE FIRES HIT SO WE'RE TRYING TO BE PROACTIVE GOING FORWARD WE KNOW THAT DROUGHTS. ARE ALL PART OF THAT PICTURE. IN AGAIN TO- I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE FOR RECOGNIZING THESE A PERILOUS CONDITIONS THAT THE STATE IS FACING FOR WORKING ON. I HOPE- YOU TAKE AWAY. FROM MY ROUTE REMARKS THAT THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO CONSERVE WATER- WHETHER THAT'S UTILIZING CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY LIKE IT UP I OR ZERO- OR EVEN DOING THEM THE- KIND OF USUAL THINGS LIKE MAKING SURE THAT THE CONSERVATION- KIDS ARE OUT THERE AND THAT PEOPLE ARE TRULY AWARE THROUGH- EDUCATION. OUTREACH BUT ALSO UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACTS THAT IT TAKES TWO OR EVERYONE. INCLUDING OUR AGRICULTURAL PARTNERS- THAT REALLY ARE ARE SO DEPENDENT UPON HAVING WATER ON THEIR PROPERTIES. TO BE ABLE TO- FEED THERE ARE LIVESTOCK. OR TO WATER THEIR CROPS. ON SO WE'VE MADE SOME GOOD PROGRESS SINCE LAST DROUGHT. ARE WE AND WE KNOW THE STATE HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS AS WELL BUT I THINK TOGETHER WE ALL HAVE A LOT MORE WORK TO DO. AND WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO MAKE THE INVESTMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE PREPARED FOR. WHATEVER THE FUTURE HAS AN OLD HAS A HOLD FOR US- SO AGAIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK AT THE- LOOK FORWARD YOUR COMMENTS AND- THANK YOU FOR ALL THE WORK THAT YOU DO NOT BEHALF OF THE STATE. THANK YOU OUR SUPERVISOR AND WE APPRECIATE YOU HIGHLIGHTING. FORECAST INFORMED RESERVOIR OPERATION PROGRAM THAT THEY BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING THAT. OF MANY ARE. INTERESTED IN WE DID HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU TO ELABORATE ON THAT. WE WILL GET BACK TO YOU T THE- POLE THAT- MEMBERS WILL BE ASKING QUESTIONS MOVE ONTO THE NEXT SENTENCE IS ONE OF THE AND THE- COMMUNITY WATER CENTER AND JUST WANT TO KNOWLEDGE TO. HER LEADERSHIP ON MANY OF THE EFFORTS. THAT HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO PROVIDE SAFE CLEAN DRINKING WATER. TO ALL CALIFORNIANS SO BUT THANK YOU FOR THAT- WORK IN PLEASE- BEGIN YOUR PRESENTATION. OKAY DID YOU. CAN YOU HEAR ME WE CAN HEAR YOU WELCOME. OKAY GREAT THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR NUMBERS MY NAME IS ONE OF THE ON THAT. I'M A CO FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY WATER CENTER AND CENTER KALANI DIRTY WATER LEVEL. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE SOME PERSPECTIVES FROM OUR HARD WORKING FAMILIES WITH YOU TODAY. GWC IS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION BASED IN CALIFORNIA THE SILICON VALLEY WITH OFFICES IN SACRAMENTO. AND THE CENTRAL COAST. OUR MISSION IS TO ACT AS A CATALYST FOR COMMUNITY DRIVEN WATER SOLUTION THROUGH ORGANIZING EDUCATION AND ADVOCACY. WORK ALONGSIDE AND SUPPORT COMMUNITIES IMPACTED BY UNSAFE DRINKING WATER AND AFFORDABLE WATER. THE SAME VERY SAME COMMUNITY SPACE VERY DEVASTATING IMPACTS AS RELATES TO WATER YOU CAN TALK MORE ABOUT THAT IN MY PRESENTATION. I WE KNOW WE HAVE HAD A DRINKING WATER CRISIS IN THE STATE FOR DECADES. EACH YEAR OVER ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS ARE EXPOSED TO UNSAFE DRINKING WATER. FROM THEIR TAPS IN THEIR HOMES. MANY CALIFORNIANS STRUGGLE TO ACCESS AFFORDABLE WATER. DUE TO THE LACK OF NOT HAVING A STATE WIDE WATER AFFORDABILITY PROGRAM. AN ESTIMATED OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS WERE IMPACTED BY WATER SHUT OFFS IN TWO THOUSAND NINE THANK YOU ALONE. THE PANDEMIC CREATED FURTHER CHALLENGES WITH CALIFORNIA'S CAPTURING AN ESTIMATE OF ONE POINT FIVE BILLION AND DRINKING WATER DEBT I THINK THIS MONTH. AND NOW WE'RE FACING ANOTHER JAPANESE CALIFORNIA ONE THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CAN BE WORSE THAN THE LAST DROUGHT. THE PRIMARY DRINKING WATER GROUNDWATER TO PERRY DRINKING WATER SOURCE FOR OVER 95% OF OUR COMMUNITIES IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. MANY COMMUNITIES RELY 100% GROUNDWATER. MANY OF THE VERY SAME ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS WITHOUT SAFE DRINKING WATER OR AT RISK OF LOSING COMPLETE WATER DURING THE DROUGHT. I WITNESSED FIRST HAND. THE DROUGHT IMPACTED MANY A FAMILY SPACE DURING THE LAST DROUGHT MANY SYSTEMS DIDN'T HAVE I COMPLAINTS INCREASED CONTAMINATION IN SOME LOCATIONS WE HAVE MAJOR LANCE INSIGHTS AS IN THE COMMUNITY ABOUT ALL. THE GROUND OF THE DROP. AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE MANY FAMILIES LOST WATER COMPLETELY. MANY OF THE STATE AND THE COUNTRY AND I WHICH EVEN THE WORLD WATCHED IN DISBELIEF AT WHAT HAPPENED IN SUPPORTER ABOUT. COUNTY WERE APPROXIMATELY SIXTEEN HUNDRED DOMESTIC WELLS WENT DRY DURING THE LAST DROUGHT. AND MANY MORE FAMILIES DROPPED THE VALUE STATE WE'RE WE'RE IMPACTED. MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE NOT RECOVERED FROM THE LAST DROUGHT. RIGHT RIGHT WELL TRIMMING DRYING SOME DAMAGE TO HAVE A WATER TANK IN FRONT OF THEIR YARD. WE KNOW DROUGHT WILL CONTINUE TO GET WORSE DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE. SHARK COMMUNITIES AND OUR FAMILIES CLIMATE CHANGE IS ALREADY HERE. SHIVER COMMUNITIES DROUGHT IS ABOUT MORE THAN JUST KEEPING WATER FLOWING THAT COMPARED DROUGHT IT'S ALSO ABOUT CLIMATE CRISIS AND WHETHER WE WILL PROVIDE OUR COMMUNITIES WITH THE RESILIENCY INVESTMENTS THEY NEED. FOR A DROUGHT IS ABOUT RACIAL JUSTICE EQUITY AND RESPECT. IN A CONTINUE PANDEMIC DROUGHT IS ABOUT PRESERVING ACCESS FOR MORE MOST BASIC FORMAT P. P. WATER. WITH THE REMAINDER OF MY TIME I WOULD LOVE TO OFFER THREE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. FIRST WE NEED A STATE DROUGHT PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE PLAN PUT IN PLACE BEFORE LARGE NUMBERS ARE FAMILIES ARE STARTING TO USE THE WATER FOR THE SUMMER WE WERE NOT READY FOR THE LAST ROUTE AS A RESULT WE SCRAMBLED. THE LOCAL STATE RESPONSES VERY UNCOORDINATED FAMILIES TO KNOW WHO TO CALL. AND MANY OF THEM WENT WITHOUT WATER FOR FAR TOO LONG. SHOULD THE STATE SHOULD PROACTIVELY PRIORITIZE REGION WE KNOW ARE AT RISK OF HAVING THE WATER INTERRUPTED DURING THIS DROUGHT. HIS TEACHER PRE POSITIONED EMERGENCY RESPONSE TO PROVIDE SUCH A BOTTLED WATER AND TANKS. I ALSO THINK THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO ENSURE THAT WE CREATE A CLEAR PUBLIC STANDARDIZED PROTOCOLS TO WHO SO THAT WE KNOW WHO TO CALL WHEN RESIDENTS LOSE WATER ALONG WITH A PROACTIVE. OUTREACH STRATEGY TO SHARE THE CONTACT INFORMATION WITH OUR COMMUNITY. SECOND WE NEED TO ALLOCATE SIGNIFICANT EMERGENCY DRINKING WATER FUNDING NOW. WE HAVE A PLACE ONLY NEEDED. THE LEGISLATURE REGULARLY ALLOCATED EMERGENCY FUNNY DURING THE LAST ROUTE FOR BOTTLED WATER AND STATE HELPFUL WELL AND PROGRAMS. IT IS EASY BUT I DO THINK IT WORKS WE HAVE PUT IN PLACE NOW THERE'S ONE THING LEFT TO WORRY ABOUT DURING THIS CRISIS. THIRD AND FINALLY LET'S SEIZE THIS MOMENT TWENTY BASK IN DROUGHT RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE FOR OUR COMMUNITIES WHO ARE ON THE FRONTLINE OF CALIFORNIA'S WATER KIND OF CRISIS. HERE'S THE THING WE ALREADY KNOW THE KINDS OF INVESTMENTS THAT WOULD MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES MORE DROUGHT RESILIENT. FIFTY JUST RELEASED A DROP REPORT THAT OUTLINES HE BASIC DROUGHT RESILIENT MEASURES THESE INCLUDE. PROVIDING A BACKUP SOURCE OF WATER FOR MORE THAN ONE POLICY SYSTEMS THAT CURRENTLY ONLY DEPEND ON ONE DRINKING WATER WELL. WE TO ENSURE THAT WE IMPLEMENT WALK. L. MONITORING SYSTEM SO THAT WE KNOW. THE DEPTH OF WATER BEFORE IT ACTUALLY RUNS DRY. WE NEED TO SUPPORT AND DEEPEN WELLS FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND HOUSEHOLDS. WE ALSO NEED TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY DRIVEN CONSOLIDATIONS WERE APPROPRIATE. AND I ALSO THINK WE TO ENSURE THAT WE PROVIDE FUNDING TO IMPLEMENT THE PROVISIONS OF SB FIVE FIVE Q. AUTHORED BY SENATOR HERTZBERG WHICH IS CURRENTLY WORKING ITS WAY THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE. VERY IMPORTANT BILL HE CALLED FOR MORE PROACTIVE DRUG PLANNING AT THE LOCAL COUNTY LEVEL WE NEED TO PASS THIS NOW. COMMONSENSE WE HAVE TO BE BETTER PREPARED FOR. DROUGHT CLOSE WE SHOULD FEEL EMPOWERED TO CHOOSE A BETTER PATH FORWARD THROUGH THIS DROUGHT FOR TOWARD THE MORE RESILIENT FUTURE. WE HAVE REAL LEADERSHIP IN THE STILL DRINKING WATER. AS YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR THE LEGISLATURE WITH PARTICULAR LEADERSHIP FROM THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER EDUARDO GARCIA HOW TO PASS THE SAME PRINCIPLE DRINKING WATER TWENTY TWENTY NINETEEN IN PARTNERSHIP WITH COMMUNITY ACTIVIST. THIS PURPOSE THE PARTNER AGAIN AND LEAD AGAIN AND I KNOW WE WILL. DO OUR CENTER INTRINSICALLY DEBORAH LEVEL LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU THE ADMINISTRATION AND SAFETY AGENCY IS TO ENSURE THAT THE HUMAN RIGHT TO ENSURE THAT WE DELIVER THE CORRECT WATER ALL CALIFORNIANS. DURING CRITICAL TIMES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I HOPE THAT- YOU'LL STAND BY FOR. POSSIBLE QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS TO YOU MAY WEIGH IN ON WILL GO ON TO THE NEXT PRESENTER THIS IS A- DOG OVER HE WITH NRDC. WHO WILL BE OUR NEXT PRESENTER. Q. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS DOUG THE PUG I'M A SENIOR ATTORNEY WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL OR NRDC. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT RECOGNIZE THE CALIFORNIA HAS MADE SOME PROGRESS IN PREPARING FOR DROUGHT SINCE THE LAST ROUTE PARTICULARLY REGARDING IMPROVING WATER USE EFFICIENCY. AS OTHER CALIFORNIA'S EFFORTS TO DIVERSIFY WATER SUPPLIES TO REDUCE RELIANCE ON THE BATTLEFIELD. THEY'VE ALSO BEEN IMPORTANT ACTIONS TO TRY TO ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S LONG STANDING DRINKING WATER CRISIS WHICH YOU JUST HEARD ABOUT. HOWEVER WHEN IT COMES TO PROTECTING CALIFORNIA'S FISH AND WILDLIFE AND THE THOUSANDS OF JOBS IN COMMUNITIES THAT DEPEND ON THEIR HEALTH. RATHER THAN LEARNING FROM THE LESSONS OF THE LAST DROUGHT WE'RE ON TRACK TO REPEAT THOSE MISTAKES. AND HAVE ANOTHER DISASTER LIKE THAT IN TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TWENTY FIFTEEN. TO PUT THIS IN CONTEXT IT'S IMPORTANT RECOGNIZE THE DROUGHT IS A NATURAL PART OF LIFE IN CALIFORNIA AN ARTIFICIAL WILDLIFE EVOLVED TO ADAPT TO PERIODIC DROUGHTS. BUT CLIMATE CHANGE IS MAKING DRUGS MUCH MORE SEVEREAND FREQUENT SO FISH HAVE LESS TIME AND WHILE THAT HAS LESS TIME TO RECOVER. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY OR AS IMPORTANTLY UNSUSTAINABLE WATER DIVERSIONS FROM OUR RIVERS AND STREAMS DRAMATICALLY WORSENED CONDITIONS FOR FISH AND WILDLIFE DURING CRAFTS. CLOSER ALREADY LOW AND THEN WE DIVERT AFTER MORE OF THE WATER THAT WOULD OTHERWISE FLOW. MY TESTIMONY TODAY IS GOING TO FOCUS ON THE BAY DELTA WATERSHED WHICH COVERS 40% OF THE STATE'S LAND MASS. WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THE DROUGHT IS CAUSING SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS TO FISH WILDLIFE ACROSS THE STATE. SUCH AS SALMON INSTRUCTORS IN THE KLAMATH RIVER. SALMON ANOTHER NAY EFFICIENT STREAMS ALONG THE NORTH COAST MIGRATORY BIRDS AND WILDLIFE THAT DEPEND ON WETLANDS AND WILDLIFE REFUGES THROUGHOUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND MANY MANY OTHERS. AND IT'S NOT JUST FISH AND WILDLIFE BUT IT'S THE JOBS AND COMMUNITIES THAT DEPEND ON THEIR HEALTH THAT ARE IMPACTED. UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE ON TRACK TO REPEAT THE DISASTROUS CONDITIONS OF TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TWENTY FIFTEEN. FOR THE BAY DELTA ECOSYSTEM THIS YEAR. AS IN THE LAST ROUTE STARTING LAST MONTH THE STATE AND FEDERAL WATER PROJECTS VIOLATED NUMEROUS WATER QUALITY STANDARDS IN THE DELTA THE PROTECT FARMS CITIES AND FISH AND WILDLIFE. LOS FLOWS AND VIOLATIONS OF WATER QUALITY STANDARDS ARE EXPECTED TO CAUSE SIGNIFICANT HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS OF SUMMER WHICH DELIVERY ARE SCIENTISTS WARN ARE A THREAT TO HUMAN HEALTH AND SAFETY. IT'S ALSO LIKELY TO HARM NATIVE FISH AND WILDLIFE. YOU KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT RECOGNIZE THE DELTA SMELT WHICH IS HISTORICALLY ONE OF THE MOST ABUNDANT. NATIVE SPECIES IN THE DELTA. HAS ALL BUT DISAPPEARED SINCE THE LAST DROUGHT THANKS TO UNSUSTAINABLE WATER DIVERSIONS ALONG WITH OTHER STRESSORS. N. AS IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY FIFTEEN THE STATE FEDERAL WATER PROJECTS ARE AGAIN LIKELY TO LOSE TEMPERATURE CONTROL. AT THE MAJOR UPSTREAM RESERVOIRS CAUSING MASSIVE MORTALITY TO NATIVE SALMON AND OTHER SPECIES THAT SPAWN BELOW SHASTA DAM OR BILL IN FULL SO. THE NATIONAL FISHERIES SERVICE ESTIMATES THAT UNDER THE BUREAU OF RECLAMATION'S PROPOSED OPERATIONS AT SHASTA DAM. PROXIMALLY 7528580% OF THE HIGHLY ENDANGERED WINTER RUN CHINOOK SALMON WILL BE KILLED BY LETHAL WATER TEMPERATURES. AT HIGH WATER TEMPERATURES IN THE FALL WILL LIKELY WIPE OUT ALL THE FALL RUN CHINOOK SALMON. THE COME BACK TO SPONSOR THOSE FISH ARE THE BACKBONE OF THE STATE'S SALMON FISHERY SUPPORTING THOUSANDS OF JOBS. AND WHILE IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE- SOME WATER USERS ARE GETTING VERY LITTLE OR NO WATER THIS YEAR. OTHERS ARE GETTING A LOT OF WATER THANKS TO CALIFORNIA'S FIRST IN TIME FIRST IN WHITE RIGHT WATER RIGHTS SYSTEM. IT MEANS THAT SOME USERS GETTING SEVENTY FIVE OR A 100% OF THEIR OUT MAXIMUM CONTRACT AMOUNTS WILL OTHERS GET. ZERO THE GATHERED THE STATE FEDERAL WATER PROJECTS ARE ON TRACK TO ALLOCATE MORE THAN FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION ACRE FEET OF WATER THIS YEAR. AND THAT'S CONTRIBUTING TO THE VIOLATIONS OF WATER QUALITY STANDARDS AND THE TEMPERATURE IMPACTS WE SEE- AT OUR UPSTREAM RESERVOIRS. WHAT'S MORE. WE'RE ON TRACK TO END THIS WATER YEAR WITH THE END OF SEPTEMBER HAVING VERY LITTLE WATER IN STORAGE. WHICH MEANS THAT IF NEXT YEAR OR TRY WILL BE REALLY UP THE CREEK WITHOUT A PADDLE. THERE PROJECTIONS THAT SHASTA WILL HAVE LESS THAN A MILLION ACRE FEET OF WATER IN STORAGE AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER. AND ORACLE WILL HAVE LESS THAN EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRE FEET AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER AND MAY. STOP PRODUCING HYDROPOWER BECAUSE LAKE LEVELS FALL SO LOW SOMETIME IN AUGUST. WE STARTED THIS YEAR WITH TWO POINT TWO MILLION ACRE FEET OF WATER IN SHASTA AND- DECENT STORAGE IN ORVILLE. AND YET WE'RE SEEING THE DEVASTATING IMPACTS TO OUR NATIVE FISH AND WILD LIKE THIS YEAR. IF WE START NEXT YEAR WITH LESS THAN A MILLION ACRE FEET OF WATER IN STE STE STORAGE IN CHESTER. THE IMPACT WILL BE FAR WORSE. AND FINALLY I DO WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE'RE SEEING THESE IMPACTS IN THE SECOND YOU'RE A DROUGHT. WHEREAS DURING THE LAST DROUGHT IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE THIRD YEAR WARY SAW THOSE DEVASTATING IMPACTS. IN TERMS OF VIOLATIONS OF WATER QUALITY STANDARDS AND TEMPERATURE DEPENDENT MORTALITY BELOW SHASTA DAM. THERE ARE THREE KEY LESSONS FROM THE LAST DROUGHT THAT UNFORTUNATELY WERE FAILING TO LEARN. AND THAT ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE DEVASTATING IMPACTS WE'RE SEEING LIKELY TO SEE THIS YEAR. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT LESSONS OF THE LAST OUT WAS THE NEED TO PLAN AHEAD FOR DROUGHT. AS THE RESOURCES AGENCIES LESSONS LEARNED REPORT EXPLAINS. QUOTE THE TWENTY TWELVE TO TWENTY SIXTEEN DROUGHT DEMONSTRATED THAT FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGERS USUALLY HAVE FEW PLANTS ARE RESOURCES TO MANAGE. DEVELOPING IN ADVANCE CONTINGENCY PLANS TO- FOR WATERSHEDS IN THE ADVENT OF EXTENDED DROUGHT. COULD HELP WILDLIFE MANAGERS AVOID MAKING TRADE OFFS AMONG SPECIES. AND PUT IN PLACE MECHANISMS TO SUSTAIN FLOWS AND STREAM TEMPERATURES DROP DEEPENS. REPORT ALSO RECOMMENDS. AS A PRIORITY. SETTING AND IMPLEMENTING INSTREAM FLOW STANDARDS FOR THE PROTECTION OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE NOT DONE THOSE THINGS. WE DO NOT HAVE A PLAN FOR DROUGHT PARTICULARLY A PLAN TO PROTECT FISH AND WILDLIFE. MOST IMPORTANTLY THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD HAS NOT BEEN ALLOWED TO UPDATE AND IMPLEMENT WATER QUALITY STANDARDS FOR THE BAY DELTA. MANY OF THE EXISTING STANDARDS HAVE NOT BEEN UPDATED IN TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND THE STANDARDS THAT WERE UPDATED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ARE STILL NOT BEING IMPLEMENTED. THE BOARD AND OTHER AGENCIES ARE RECOGNIZED AT THE EXISTING STANDARDS ARE NOT ADEQUATE TO PROTECT FILE. FISH WILDLIFE AND OTHER BENEFICIAL USES. WHAT'S MORE. AFTER THE BOARD WHERE STANDARDS IN THE LAST DROUGHT IN TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TWENTY FIFTEEN AND NEARLY PRO SPECIES EXTINCT. THE BOARD RECOGNIZE THAT QUOTE. THAT THAT THOSE OPERATIONS QUOTE ARE NOT SUSTAINABLE. AND QUOTE AND RECOMMENDED CHANGES TO DROUGHT PLANNING AND PROCESSES TO PREVENT EXTINCTION. YEAH HERE WE ARE AGAIN. LESS THAN A MONTH AFTER THE DIRECTOR DETER OVER OUR TOLD US THAT WE WOULD NOT HAVE FEW CPA'S TEMPORARYSINCE THE CHANGE PETITIONS FORCING THE PROJECT VIOLATING WATER QUALITY STANDARDS IN THE DELTA. AND IN A LETTER FROM THE STATE WATER BOARD AT THE END OF LAST MONTH. THE BOARD EXPLAINED THAT QUOTE ALTHOUGH THE CURRENT VIOLATIONS ARE EXACERBATED BY THE EXTREME DRY CONDITIONS. THERE IN PART THE RESULT OF OVER ALLOCATION OF PRODUCT WATER DURING DRY CONDITIONS. ADDITIONALLY A RISK MANAGEMENT OPERATIONAL DECISIONS BY THE PROJECTS WERE MADE THAT APPEAR TO HAVE DISCOUNTED AND NEED TO MAINTAIN REGULATORY COMPLIANCE. IN OTHER WORDS THE STATE FEDERAL WATER PROJECTS DON'T HAVE A PLAN FOR DROUGHTS. THEIR PROMISES AND WATER SUPPLY CONTRACTS MAKE THEM UNABLE TO MEET THEIR OTHER WATER RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS INCLUDING THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO THE PUBLIC. AND THE PLAN FOR DROUGHT APPEARS TO BE VIOLATING THE REGULATIONS PROTECTING THE PUBLIC AND VIOLATING WATER QUALITY STANDARDS. AND AGAIN WELL THE DROUGHT WHILE THE STATE WILL RESIST WATER RESILIENCY PLAN CALLS FOR. HAVING PLANS IN PLACE TO PROTECT FISH WILDLIFE FROM ABOUT LASTING TO SIX YEARS. WE'RE NOT EVEN MEETING THE OUTDATED AND INADEQUATE WATER QUALITY STANDARDS IN YEAR TWO OF A DROUGHT. A SECOND RELATED RECOMMENDATION OF THE REPORT FROM THE RESOURCES AGENCY. CONCERNS THE NEED TO MAKE THIS IS EARLY STATING THAT QUOTE ROUTE PLANNING AND RESPONSE EFFORTS SHOULD NOT WAIT UNTIL THE MIDDLE OF A DROUGHT EMERGENCY. AND QUOTE. AND ON THIS CAL THE STATE IS ALSO FEELING. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT LESSONS WE LEARNED WITH THE NEED TO DEVELOP TEMPERATURE MANAGEMENT PLANS EARLY IN THE YEAR BECAUSE RESERVOIR RELEASES FROM SHASTA AND KESWICK DAMS AND HER MOTHER RESERVOIRS. CAN DEPLETE THE COLD WATER POOL NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN WATER TEMPERATURES FOR SALMON LATER IN THIS IN THE YEAR. THE STATE HAS NOT DONE SO IN PART BECAUSE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. ROLL BACK ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS UNDER THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT. AND LEGALIZED KILLING A 100% OF THE ENDANGERED WINTER RUN CHINOOK SALMON. THANKS AS A GIVEAWAY TO CORPORATE AGRIBUSINESSES. THESE BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS ARE PLANNED FOR EXTINCTION. AND IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION SET THEM ASIDE AND RE INITIATE CONSULTATIONS SO THAT WE CAN DEVELOP SCIENTIFICALLY CREDIBLE PLANS TO PREVENT EXTINCTION AND MANAGE THESE WATER PROJECTS IN A ERA. WHEN WE FACE GROWING THREATS AND STRUCK HARDER CONDITIONS FOR FISH AND WILDLIFE. IT'S NOW EARLY MAY AND WE STILL DON'T HAVE A DRAFT TEMPERATURE MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR SHASTA. EVEN AS EXCESSIVE RELEASES FROM THE RESERVOIR DEPLETED THE COLD WATER POOL STARTING LAST MONTH AND WE'RE ON TRACK TO KILL 75280% OF THE IT THIS. HIGHLY ENDANGERED SPECIES. REDUCING THOSE RESERVOIR RELEASES WOULD SUBSTANTIALLY DECREASE HOW MANY EXAMINER KILLED THIS YEAR. AND LEAD MORE WATER IN STORAGE IN CASE NEXT YEAR'S ALSO DRIVE. HIDING RELEASES WOULD COULD CUT MORTALITY FROM 80% DOWN TO FIFTY PERCENT. IMPROVE WATER TEMPERATURES FOR FALL RUN CHINOOK SALMON AND INCREASED RESERVOIR STORAGE IN CASE NEXT YEAR'S STUFF. AT THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE REPORT IS TO STREAMLINE WATER RIGHTS ENFORCEMENT. AND AGAIN THERE'S A LOT MORE WORK TO BE DONE. THE WATER BOARD HAS ISSUED TERM NINETY ONE CURTAILMENTS BUT THAT APPLIES TO A VERY SMALL SUBSET WATER USERS IN THE BAY DELTA. AND EVEN AS WATER QUALITY STANDARDS ARE BEING VIOLATED AND SAM OR FACING LETHAL WATER TEMPERATURES THIS WINTER THIS FALL AND SUMMER. THE STATE BOARD HAS NOT ISSUED WIDESPREAD CURTAILMENT ORDERS LIKE THEY DID IN THE LAST DROUGHT. STATE BOARD HAS THE LEGAL AUTHORITY AND THE RESPONSIBILITY TO CURTAIL WATER DIVERSIONS INCLUDING PRE NINETEEN FOURTEEN WATER RIGHTS HOLDERS TO PROTECT FISH AND WILDLIFE AND THE PUBLIC TRUST. THAT IT ALREADY HAS AN UP SELL A PUBLIC WORKS INCLUDING A TWENTY TWENTY DECISION IN THE STANFORD BEING A CASE. WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE STATE FOR TAKE ACTION TO START. FOR TAILING WATER RIGHTS. BECAUSE NO WATER RATES IN CALIFORNIA ARE SUPERIOR TO THE PUBLIC TRUST. AND EXTINCTION IS FOREVER. UPDATING WATER QUALITY STANDARDS WILL ALSO HELP BECAUSE TODAY. THE STATE AND FEDERAL WATER PROJECTS ARE LARGELY THE ONLY WATER USERS HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE TO MEETING WATER QUALITY STANDARDS. AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT IN A YEAR LIKE THIS EVERYONE HAS TO CONTRIBUTE. IN CONCLUSION UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA'S FISH AND WILDLIFE IS A REPEAT OF THE DISASTROUS CONDITIONS IN TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TWENTY FIFTEEN. BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S REPEATING MANY OF THE SAME MISTAKES FROM THE PRIOR DROUGHT. THE STATE'S PLAN FOR DROUGHT ALL TOO OFTEN SEEMS TO FOCUS ON TRAINING RESERVOIRS AND PRAYING FOR RAIN. WAIVING ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS THAT ARE ALREADY TOO WEAK TO PROTECT OUR NATIVE FISH AND WILDLIFE. AND DRIVING FISH AND WILDLIFE TO THE BRINK OF EXTINCTION. AND POTENTIALLY TO EXTINCTION. THIS FAILURE TO PLAN FOR DROUGHTS AND UPDATE OUR WATER QUALITY STANDARDS DOESN'T JUST HARMONY TO FISH AND WILDLIFE. IT ALSO HARMS NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES THOUSANDS OF FISHING JOBS AND COMMUNITIES IN THE DELTA THAT ARE FACING HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS. WE CAN AND MUST DO BETTER BECAUSE OF NEXT YEAR'S ALSO DRIVE THE DEVASTATION THAT WE FORESEE THIS YEAR. WILL BE FAR WORSE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY THAT CONCLUDES MY PREPARED REMARKS. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUR NEXT PRESENTERS HERE IN PERSON AND IT'S A TROLL. THE BOSS CARE. ACT PLEASE. FOR THE LOVE CARE. REUTERS GOOD AFTERNOON I'D LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR VICE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY ON HOW DROUGHT HAS IMPACTED MY FRIENDS MY FAMILY MY BUSINESS AND MY COMMUNITY AND ABOUT WAYS TO CALIFORNIA CAN IMPROVE ITS RESILIENCE TO DROUGHT MY NAME IS JOE THE LOS QUE AND I'M A FARMER FROM FIREBAUGH CALIFORNIA. I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN FARMING ALL MY LIFE ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY FOR MY FAMILY SETTLED AFTER YEARS OF WORKING IN THE FIELDS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE I STARTED MY OWN FARM DEL BOSQUE FARMS ARE MY OUR PRIMARY BUSINESS IS GOING-ORGANIC CROPS WHICH INCLUDE CANTALOUPES I NEED NEWS MIXED MELONS WATERMELONS ESPERICUETA'S AND SWEETCORN WE ALSO GROW CONVENTIONAL ALMONDS CHERRIES. I'VE BEEN VERY FORTUNATE TO BE ABLE TO SERVE MY COMMUNITY- AND MY INDUSTRY IN VARIOUS CAPACITIES AS A MEMBER OF THE LATINO WATER COALITION. WAS TERROR ATTACKS A- A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF CENTRAL VALLEY COMMUNITY FOUNDATION AND A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA WATER COMMISSION. AS I TOLD PRESIDENT OBAMA WHEN I VISITED WHEN HE VISITED THE VALLEY IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN DURING THE LAST DROUGHT THERE ARE THREE THINGS THAT MAKE FARMING WORK IN CALIFORNIA. SO OIL WATER AND PEOPLE. REMOVE ANY OF THE THREE COMPONENTS AND CALIFORNIA WOULD NOT BE THE TOP PRODUCING AGRICULTURAL STATE IN THE NATION. NOR COULD WE PROVIDE CALIFORNIANS IN THE NATION TE SECURITY OF KNOWING THAT ITS FRUITS AND VEGETABLES WILL BE ON THE SHELVES AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE. AND PRODUCED ADDED IN AN ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND MANNER. THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC TAUGHT US MANY THINGS BUT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT LESSONS LEARNED WAS THAT THE FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN MUST BE PRESERVED. IRVING THAT FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN MEANS THAT WE MUST PROTECT THOSE THREE COMPONENTS SOIL WATER AND PEOPLE ESPECIALLY DURING THE DROUGHT. MOST NATURAL DISASTERS ARE QUITE OBVIOUS HERE KINGS UPROOT TREES DISPLACED POWER LINES WELL FIRES WIPE OUT HOMES AND LANDSCAPES EARTHQUAKES SHAKE THE VERY GROUND WE WALK ON DROUGHT IS DIFFERENT. ON MY OWN FARM WE SEE ON PLANTED FEELS. WE ARE WE ARE NOT ABLE TO GROW CROPS THERE'S NO WATER THERE'S NO CROPS THERE'S NO PEOPLE. I CALL IT SILENT SPRING IN THE FIELDS AND RIGHT NOW OF MORE THAN 25% OF MY FARM IS LAID FALLOW. CALIFORNIA'S LAST DROUGHT WAS ONE OF THE MOST SEVERE IN OUR HISTORY. TESTED ALL ASPECTS OF OUR OF WATER MANAGEMENT IN THE STATE SHOWCASING INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS. BUT ALSO LAYING BARE THE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES THAT STILL EXIST. FIVE CONSECUTIVE DRY WINTER SHUT OFF WATER DELIVERIES TO MANY A COMMUNITIES AND FARMS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY FOR TWO CONSECUTIVE YEARS FORCING THE REGION TO SOLELY RELY ON GROUNDWATER AQUIFERS. FOR WATER% SUPPLY. WHICH IN TURN HAD OTHER NEGATIVE OF NEGATIVE AFFECTS INCLUDING IMPAIRED DRINKING WATER QUALITY DRY WELLS AND DAMAGED HIS INFRASTRUCTURE. FARMERS FOLLOWED AN ESTIMATED FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES OF FARMLAND ABOUT 10% OF THE FARM LAND IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND A 45% INCREASE OF STATEWIDE ANNUAL FELLOW ACREAGE. THE TOTAL ECONOMIC IMPACT TECH RECALLED HER IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WAS TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR LOSS WITH TWENTY ONE THOUSAND JOBS BEING LOST WHICH AMOUNT 25% OF AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYMENT. LET ME REPEAT THAT TWENTY ONE THOUSAND JOBS LOST MOSTLY FARMWORKERS. THAT'S TWENTY ONE THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS WHO NO LONGER HAVE THE SECURITY OF A JOB TO FEED THEIR FAMILIES. AND FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN LACK OF AVAILABLE WATER. IMPORTANTLY THESE JOB LOSSES COINCIDE WITH SOME OF THE MOST ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA AS COMMUNITIES IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY WITH POVERTY LEVELS OVER 75% ARE THOSE MOST IMPACTED BY JOB LOSSES RESULTING FROM LAND FOLLOWING. AND THE IMPACTS OF THE OF THE LAST TROUT WERE NOT LIMITED TO ECONOMIC LOSSES. THE WORST SEVERE. PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH IMPACTS THE DEBT THAT RESULTED FROM THE LAST DROUGHT. A REPORT DONE BY CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY FRESNO INDICATES THAT DURING THE LAST TROUT INSTANCES OF VALLEY FEVER INCREASED BY NEARLY SEVENTY PERCENT. WEST NILE VIRUS WITH THIS DETECTED AT AN ALL TIME HIGH IN FORTY FOUR COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA. SUICIDES RATES INCREASED DRAMATICALLY AS HIS SOCIAL CRIMES LIKE DOMESTIC OR DOMESTIC ABUSE AND THEFT. THREE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY COUNTIES KERN MADERA KINGS REPORT THAT TWELVE POINT 5% OF THE SERVICE SURVEYED OF POPULATIONS HAVE SERIOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL ILLNESSES. IT ALSO HAPPENS THAT THESE COUNTIES AND THE VALLEY GENERALLY HAVE THE LOWEST NUMBER OF PRACTICING PHYSICIANS PER COUNTY SO THESE COMMUNITIES ARE AMONG THE THOSE LEAST EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH THESE IMPACTS. WE KNOW THAT THE IMPACTS OF DROUGHT AS WE HAVE ONLY RECENTLY BEGUN TO RECOVER FROM THE LAST ONE. AND MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT WE ARE IN A DROUGHT. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF VERY SIGNIFICANT AND VERY REAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE LAST DROUGHT AND THIS ONE. THE FIRST AND MARK MOST TROUBLING ONE IS THAT DURING THE LAST DROUGHT WE BEGIN TO EXPERIENCED SERIOUS IMPACT DURING THE THIRD YEAR. TODAY WE'RE ONLY IN THE SECOND YEAR AND WE HAVE NO SURFACE WATER DELIVERIES TO MANY FEDERAL WATER DISTRICTS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. AND DRAMATICALLY REDUCE CREASE DELIVERIES TO THOSE SERVED IN THE STATE WATER PROVIDE THE STATE WATER PROJECT. FROM THAT STANDPOINT IT SEEMS LIKE WE'VE TAKEN A STEP BACKWARDS. FURTHER AS I MENTIONED EARLIER DURING THE LAST DROUGHT FARMERS WERE ABLE TO RELY ON GROUNDWATER TO GROW ROPS WHEN SERVICE WATER WAS NOT DELIVERED. HOWEVER PUMPING GROUNDWATER TO COMPENSATE FOR THE LACK OF SURFACE WATER WILL NO LONGER BE AVAILABLE. GOV GIVEN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT ACT OF TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WHAT WE CALL SIGMA. GIVEN THE FUTURE CONSTRAINTS WE MUST BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE DESPERATELY NEED SO WE ARE ABLE TO MOVE AND SAVE THE WATER TO GET. IN THE WAY YOURS AND USE THAT WATER IN THE DRY YEARS WE KNOW WILL COME. THIS MEANS INVESTMENTS AND CONVEYANCE SURFACE WATER STORAGE AND APPLE FOR RECHARGE NOT IN FIVE YEARS BUT TODAY. ON TO MY FAVORITE PART HOW DO WE DO BETTER FOR TODAY AND FOR THE FUTURE. IN THE SHORT TERM THERE ARE FEW POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS THAT CAN IMMEDIATELY DELIVER BENEFITS TO THE COMMUNITIES MOST IN NEED. THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR SHOULD IMMEDIATELY AND PASSED THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF FUNDING POSSIBLE. INTO SHOVEL READY PROJECTS THAT CAN IMPROVE THE WATER SUPPLY FOR THOSE FARMS COMMUNITIES AND ECOSYSTEMS THAT HAVE MOST BEEN IMPACTED BY THE DROUGHT WITH. AND WITHIN EIGHTEEN MONTHS. FOR EXAMPLE W. R. CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS MAINTAINED THE LOS MANIC STREET DETENTION RESERVOIR AS A DETENTION FLOOD CONTROL RESERVOIR MEANING WATER IS HELD IN THE RESERVOIR UNTIL IT EVAPORATES. INSTEAD THE OPERATIONS OF THE RESERVOIR COULD BE MODIFIED TO IMPROVE GROUNDWATER RECHARGE BY INSTALLING A PIPELINE AND PUMP STATION TO RELEASE FLOWS FROM THE RESERVOIR INTO LOS BANOS CREEK. IMPROVING WHAT GROUNDWATER RECHARGE WATERSIDE A SUPPLY RELIABILITY AND HABITAT. FOUR TWO POINT NINE MILLION ITS ESTIMATE THIS PROJECT COULD GENERATE NEARLY EIGHT THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF GROUND WATER RECHARGE IN WET YEARS WATER THAT IS CRITICAL AND YEARS LIKE THE ONE WE'RE IN. SECOND THE WATER TRANSFER PROCESS. A VITAL LIFELINE FOR FARMERS LIKE ME. SHOULD BE STREAMLINED TO MOVE AS MUCH WATER FROM WILLING SELLERS TO WILLING BUYERS AS POSSIBLE WHEN IT'S NEEDED. IT DOESN'T HELP ME TO PURCHASE WATER FROM PARTNERS IF I AM ONLY ABLE TO RECEIVE THAT WATER WHEN MY PLANTS HAVE ALREADY DIED. AND IMMEDIATE EXAMPLE OF THIS WOULD BE TO CUT THE GREEN TAPE BY REDUCING THE REGULATORY HURDLES WHICH WOULD EXPEDITE WATER TRANSFERS. FOR INSTANCE DURING THE LAST TROUT SEQUEL WAS WAIVED FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF INTER REGIONAL WATER TRANSFERS SIMILAR EFFORTS SHOULD BE MADE THIS YEAR. ANOTHER OPTION THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED DURING THE LAST DROUGHT IS THE INSTALLATION OF BARRIERS IN THE DELTA TO PREVENT SALT WATER INTRUSION. HOW FOR LONG TERM IN THE LONG TERM THE SOLUTIONS FOR IMPROVING CALIFORNIA'S DROUGHT RESILIENCE HAVE BEEN WELL UNDERSTOOD FOR A LONG TIME. ONLY A TEN YEAR AVERAGE THERE IS ENOUGH PRECIPITATION AND SNOWPACK TO MEET. CALIFORNIA'S DEMANDS THE CHALLENGES MOVING IT WHERE IT'S NEEDED WHEN IT'S AVAILABLE WHICH IS LIMITED DURING. LIMITED NOT A NUMBER OF YEARS AND STORING IT FOR WHEN IT'S NEEDED WHICH IS A LARGER NUMBER OF YEARS. TRADITIONALLY CALIFORNIA HAS RELIED ON THE SNOW PACK TO BE A NATURAL RESERVOIR AND THIS FIFTY HISTORICALLY HAS WORKED WELL. HOWEVER CLIMATE CHANGE MEANS THAT CALENDAR CALIFORNIA'S WHAT YEARS ARE BOTH MORE WET AND LESS FREQUENT AND IT'S A DRY YOURS ARE MORE FREQUENT AND MORE DRY. SO CALIFORNIA MUST ADAPT. THIS MEANS APPROVING THE ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT MANAGEMENT OF OUR WATER SYSTEMS MANAGING WATERSHEDS IN A COMPREHENSIVE WAY THAT HAS MULTIPLE BENEFITS INCLUDING WATER SUPPLY. IT IT MEANS BUILDING PROJECTS THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN PLANNED FOR YEARS SOME FOR DECADES THAT MUST BE FINALLY BUILT THIS MEANS RESTORING AND INCREASING CONVEYANCE CAPACITY AND INCREASING WATER STORAGE IN CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY SOUTH OF THE DELTA. THERE ARE MANY BILLS BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE THAT WOULD ACCOMPLISH SOME OF THOSE GOALS. BUT I WILL HIGHLIGHT ONE OF THEM OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE. SENATOR MELISSA OR TITLES SB FIVE FIVE NINE. SB FIVE FIVE NINE WOULD MAKE A ONE TIME INVESTMENT TO RESTORE THE CONVEYANCE CAPACITY OF CALIFORNIA'S ARTERIAL CANALS WHICH HAVE LOST SIGNIFICANT CAPACITY. ADDRESSING THE IMPACTS OF THE OF THE SUBSIDENCE ALONG THESE CANALS IS PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP. TO BUILD TO BUILDING RESILIENCE TO CHANGING CLIMATE AND TO PRESERVING THE ECONOMY'S JOBS ECOSYSTEMS OF CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. SEPARATELY WE MUST FINALLY INCEASED WATER STORAGE BY MOVING FORWARD WITH PROJECTS LIKE EXPANDING SAN LUIS RESERVOIR EXPANDING LOS VAQUEROS RESERVOIR AND INCREASING GROUNDWATER STORAGE AND RECHARGE. THE SOLUTIONS ARE THERE. THEY'VE BEEN STUDIED FOR YEARS WE SIMPLY NEED TO HAVE THE POLITICAL WILL TO FOLLOW THROUGH. LUCKILY THIS YEAR'S BUDGET SURPLUS COMBINED WITH FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ANTICIPATED INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE COMBINED WITH BOND PROPOSALS ADVANCED BY THE SENATE AND CHAIRMAN GARCIA I MEAN THAT WE CAN ADVANCE THEM NOW. DROUGHT HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE A REALITY IN CALIFORNIA WE MUST BE PREPARED. BUT CALIFORNIA HAS ALSO BEEN BLESSED WITH ABUNDANT NATURAL RESOURCES SOME OF THE MOST FERTILE LAND IN THE WORLD AND CREATIVE SOLUTION ORIENTED PEOPLE. FROM THE DAYS OF ITS FOUNDING. WE HAVE SOIL WATER AND PEOPLE THIS IS A PROBLEM WE CAN OVERCOME WITH PLANNING INVESTMENT FORWARD THINKING. JOHN STEINBECK SAID IT BEST AND IT NEVER FAILED THAT DURING THE DRY YEARS THE PEOPLE FORGOT ABOUT THE RICH YEARS AND DURING THE WAIT YEARS THEY LOST ALL MEMORY OF THE DRY YEARS. IT WAS ALWAYS THAT WAY. SADLY THIS HAS BEEN TRUE IN MANY AREAS OF CALIFORNIA. THE PEOPLE OF THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY DO NOT HAVE THAT LUXURY WE MUST DO BETTER FOR THE FARMERS FOR THE PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY AND FOR OUR NATION'S FOOD SECURITY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I LOOK FOR TO ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU- THIS IS THE MOST GIVE FOR PREPPING IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE AG INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA. AND SOME REAL CHALLENGES THAT ARE BEFORE ALL OF US- WHEN IT COMES TO THIS JOB DISCUSSION SO- PLEASE STAND BY AND I'M SURE THERE'LL BE SOME. QUESTIONS FOR YOU AS WELL WE GET INTO OUR LAST- PRESENTER. AND THAT IS- SANDY CURL WITH THE SAN DIEGO. COUNTY WATER AUTHORITY AND I JUST SO. WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE MEMBERS THAT ARE HERE- LISTENING DILIGENTLY AND- WANTING TO. CHIME IN ON THIS IMPORTANT CONVERSATION THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION- OUTLASTED THE SANDY- PLEASE- IF YOU'RE READY- PROCEED WITH YOUR PRESENTATION. GOOD AFTERNOON-% AND CAN YOU SEE MY FLIGHTS. YES YEAH- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE TODAY ON THE GENERAL MANAGER OF THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY WATER AUTHORITY- I WANT TO THANK HER GARCIA IN THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS- FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS- WHAT WE'VE DONE IN OUR STORY IN SAN DIEGO. COUNTY OUR REGION AND- WHAT WE'VE DONE IN TERMS OF- PREPARING FOR THE DROUGHT WE ARE WHOLESALE- PROVIDER FOR THE REGION AND OUR AGENCY WAS CREATED IN NINETEEN FORTY FOUR AS AN ACT OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW US TO TAKE WATER FOR METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN LA BETTER KNOWN AS M. W. D. WE DO THAT FOR ABOUT SAID- SYSTEM OF PIPELINES THREE HUNDRED AND TEN MILES OF THEM THAT DELIVER WATER. TO OUR TWENTY FOUR MEMBER AGENCIES THAT IS HIGHLIGHTED ON THE MAP UP ON THE SCREEN WE ALSO PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN TERMS OF LONG TERM WATER SUPPLY PLANNING AND PREPARATION FOR THE REGION A ROLE THAT NO OTHER AGENCY PLAYS. IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY. BUT WE ARE AT THE END OF A VERY LONG PIPELINE THAT CONNECTS TO BOTH THE STATE WATER PROJECT AND THE COLORADO RIVER AQUEDUCT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT SAN DIEGO WHO REALLY IS A UNIQUE REGION. WE HAVE VERY FEW NATURAL WATER RESOURCES SUCH AS GROUNDWATER AND WE GET VERY LITTLE RAINFALL- SUMMER SURPRISED TO KNOW THAT WE GET ABOUT TEN INCHES OF RAIN A YEAR THAT COMPARES TO LOS ANGELES THAT FIFTEEN INTEREST A YEAR. AND SAN FRANCISCO WHICH GETS ABOUT TWENTY ONE INCHES. SO THE MORE MAJORITY OF OUR WATER COMING INTO THE REGION TRAVEL SOME DISTANCE. ON THE COLORADO RIVER TO REACH THE WATER AUTHORITY'S AQUIDNECK SYSTEM. ABOUT- 10% OF THE WATER HOW WE USE IN THE REGION INCOME SIX HUNDRED MILES- THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA AQUEDUCT AND THE REMAINING 24% IS FROM LOCAL SUPPLIES AND THIS INCLUDES OUR SEA WATER DESALINATION PLANT IN CARLSBAD WATER PURIFICATION PROJECTS- THAT ARE CURRENTLY- THAT. CONSTRUCTED AND THOSE- COMING ONLINE AND THEN SURFACE WATER WHICH IS STORM WATER RUN OFF AGAIN- A SMALL PORTION OF THE WATER THAT WE HAVE. SO TODAY I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT WE HAVE SUFFICIENT SUPPLIES FOR THIS VERY DRY YEAR I IN FACT OUR STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT WE HAVE SUFFICIENT SUPPLIES TO- WHETHER MULTIPLE DRY YEARS IN A ROW WHICH SUPPORT OUR QUALITY OF LIFE AND OUR ECONOMY FOR DECADES TO COME. SO HOW DID WE GET HERE BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE THE COUNTY WATER AUTHORITY. DISTINTIVO COUNTY WAS RELIANT ON ONE SOURCE OF WATER- FOR ABOUT 95% OF ITS WATER. AND THEN DUE TO SEVERE DROUGHTS- BECAUSE- THE SAN DIEGO REGION TO SUFFER THIRTEEN MONTHS OF SUPPLY ALLOCATION REDUCTION. THAT ADULTS A SEVERE BLOW TO THE ECONOMY AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND THAT HAPPENED IN THE- EARLY. IN NINETEEN NINETY. THE PAINFUL RESTRICTIONS ON WATER SUPPLY CHAIN GALVANIZED HER REGION'S BUSINESSES AND COMMUNITY LEADERS TO MAKE DEMANDED. STRATEGY THAT WOULD PREVENT SUCH A SITUATION FROM HAPPENING AGAIN IN FACT THERE WAS A RALLY IN CLIENTS THAT WE SHOULD NEVER AGAIN BE PLACED IN THIS SITUATION. TACKLING A MYRIAD OF CHALLENGES SUCH AS GROWING DEMAND FOR WATER ACROSS THE SOUTHWEST ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS DROUGHTS AND IN THEIR STATE LEGAL BATTLES THE WATER AUTHORITY CAREFULLY CHARTED A NEW COURSE FOR BEATING THE REGION'S WATER NEEDS. THROUGH A VARIETY OF SOURCES NICK AND NEW OR IMPROVED FACILITIES IT WAS THE WATER SUPPLY EQUIVALENT OF A DIVERSIFIED STOCK PORTFOLIO. THE MULTI PRONGED APPROACH RELIED MORE. I'M MORE THAN THREE BILLION DOLLARS OPERATIONAL INVESTMENTS RATEPAYERS LONGSTANDING COMMITMENT TO WATER USE EFFICIENCY INNOVATION AND CHALLENGING THE STATUS QUO. AND DIVERSIFY IT IS WHAT WE DID. OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES HOW DID WE DO IT FIRST RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES IN OUR REGION ARE MAKING THE MOST USE OF EVERY DROP OF WATER IN THE SAN DIEGO REACH AND- WE ARE A LEADER IN WATER CONSERVATION AND WATER USE EFFICIENCY AND HELPING DISTRICT HELPED SHAPE THE STATUTORY AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK. IN THIS POLICY AREA FOR MORE THAN THREE DECADES. SAN DIEGO COUNTY RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES HAVE REDUCE PER CAPITA WATER USE BY NEARLY HALF OVER THE PAST THIRTY YEARS. AND A COMMITMENT TO EFFICIENCY IS SO DEEPLY INGRAINED IN OUR CULTURE THAT THERE'S BEEN A LITTLE REBOUND IN WATER USE FALLING IN THE- TWENTY TWELVE TO TWENTY SIXTEEN DROUGHT. WE'VE ALSO ADDED NEW SUPPLIES HISTORIC WATER TRANSFER AND CONSERVATION AGREEMENTS ARE PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT SUPPLIES EACH YEAR IS NOW ABOUT 50% OF THE SLOT SUPPLY THAT WE USE IN THE SAN DIEGO REGION. OUR MEMBER AGENCIES HAVE BUILT PROJECTS TO RECYCLE WASTE WATER FOR IRRIGATION USES USING PURPLE PIPE AND LOOKING AHEAD TO THEY ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT FOR POSSIBLE REUSE PROJECTS. THAT WILL TURN WASTE WATER INTO DRINKING WATER. WE'VE TURN SEAWATER INTO DRINKING WATER AT THE CARLSBAD DESALINATION PLANT. AND WE'VE BUILT ADDITIONAL STORAGE CAPACITY SO WE CAN CAPTURE RUNOFF FROM. NEW BIG RAINSTORMS WE GET MOST YEARS. HERE ARE SOME OF THE- MOST IMPORTANT PROJECTS INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS THAT THE WATER AUTHORITY HAS MADE TO EXPAND OUR STORAGE AND DIVERSIFY OUR WATER SUPPLY WE HAVE NEW AND EXPANDED WATER STORAGE WE BUILT ALLEVIATE PAIN DAM AND RESERVOIR AND THAT WAS COMPLETED IN TWO THOUSAND THREE. THE SANTA CENTER YOU REYES WHICH IS THE LARGEST SINGLE INCREASE AND REGIONAL- STORAGE IN OUR HISTORY WAS COMPLETED IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN. WE BUILT A STATE OF THE ART WATER TREATMENT PLANT TO IMPROVE OUR REGION'S CAPACITY TO TREAT WATER WATER WE ALSO BUILT ADDITIONAL PIPELINES AND PUMP STATIONS TO ADD THE ABILITY TO MOVE WATER INTO AND OUT OF. LIKE COLLEGES TO TAKE BETTER ADVANTAGE OF SUPPLIES THERE LAKE HUNDRED PROJECT ALSO INCLUDES THE ABILITY TO PRODUCE HYDROELECTRIC POWER ON DEMAND TO HELP MEET THE REGION'S ENERGY NEEDS AND NOW WITH THE CHANGE IN THE ENERGY ENVIRONMENT IT IS USED EVERY DAY. WE HAVE AN EXTENSIVE AQUIDNECK PROTECTION PROGRAM WHICH MONITORS THE CONDITION OF OUR THREE HUNDRED AND TEN MILES OF LARGE DIAMETER. WATER TRANSMISSION PIPELINES AROUND THE COUNTY WHICH MAKE UP THE WATER AUTHORITY'S WATER SYSTEM. THE GOOD NEWS. IS THAT WE HAVE- INVESTORS ARE INVESTMENT MEANS THAT WE HAVE SUFFICIENT WATER SAID SPPLIES FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND BEYOND AND INDEED FOR MULTIPLE WATER AND DRY WATER YEARS. SO IF YOU LOOK AT THIS- PIE CHART IT IS STARKLY DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE THAT YOU SAW- THAT I SHOWED YOU EARLIER FROM NINETEEN NINETY ONE. OUR DIVERSIFICATION HAS YIELDED MANY BENEFITS- IN PROVIDING- PROTECTION AGAINST DROUGHT AND BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE THIS IS WHAT OUR CARDS HARPER LOOK LIKE AND THE MAJORITY OF THE INCREASE DIVERSIFICATION. ON THIS PIE CHART IS COMING IN THE AREA OF POSSIBLE REUSE PROJECT. THIS IS WHAT OUR WATER BILLS ARE CAME FOR SAFE AND RELIABLE WATER SUPPLIES EVEN WHEN THERE'S NOT A LOT OF WATER TO GO AROUND. LOOKING AHEAD I WANT TO GIVE YOU A PICTURE ABOUT SOME VERY IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARTNERSHIPS IN LINE WITH GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S WATER RESILIENCY PORTFOLIO MODEL. THE WATER AUTHORITY BOARD OF DIRECTORS VOTED IN JULY TWENTY NINETEEN TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S APPROACH WHICH ALIGNS CLOSELY WITH OUR APPROACH SINCE THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES. POSSIBLE REDUCE DEVELOPMENT AGAIN AS THE NEXT INCREMENT OF WATER SUPPLY IN THE REGION. COLLECTIVELY THE REGION IS EXPECTED TO BRING ONLINE MORE THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF NEW POSSIBLE RE USE WATER. IN THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS. IMPORTANTLY I AND AS WAS MENTIONED BY ONE OF THE SPEAKERS EARLIER WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE STATE'S REGULATORY FRAMEWORK TO REMOVE HURDLES FOR DIRECT POTABLE REUSE. WHICH COULD EXPEDITE DEVELOPMENT THE OF THESE IMPORTANT WATER SUPPLIES AND SAVE RATEPAYERS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WE ARE LOOKING FOR THE OPTION FOR THE WATER AUTHORITY'S STORE WATER IN LAKE MEAD AND HELP THE COLORADO RIVER BASIN AS A WHOLE WHICH FINDS ITSELF IN A QUITE DIRE SITUATION. THERE'S ALSO FUTURE POTENTIAL FOR PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES WITH REGIONAL COMBAT SYSTEM THAT WOULD TRANSPORT ARE INDEPENDENT KALRA RIVER WATER SUPPLIES STRAIGHT FROM THE IMPERIAL VALLEY TO SAN DIEGO. THIS RECENT EDITORIAL CARTOON FROM SAN DIEGO UNION TRIBUNE SUCH THAT BASS HERE IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY WE'VE TAKEN THE SCOUTS MOTTO ALWAYS BE PREPARED AS WE HEADED INTO ANOTHER DROUGHT YEAR WITH OUR CANTEENS FILLED BY MULTIPLE WATER SOURCES. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE TODAY I'D BE HAPPY TO DISCUSS ANY OF THESE ISSUES IF WE- HAVE ADDITIONAL TIME TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND ALL OF THE PRISONERS ON THIS- THIRD AND FINAL PANEL WE- HAVE- DOING GOOD ON TIME WE'VE THAT THIRTY MINUTES- THAT WE RESERVE. FOR QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS TO ANY OF THE PALACE AND FALL ASK THAT THE MY COLLEAGUES HERE. YOU WANT TO- JUMP RIGHT IN. OF WHAT WE WANT TO ASK QUESTIONS BEFORE PUBLIC COMMENT YES SIR OKAY NOW GO RIGHT TO SANDRA BECAUSE I HAD A QUESTION IN REGARDS TO THE- CARLSBAD DESALINATION PLANT. WHAT IT COST YOU BUT THEN YOU SAID IT WAS ONE BILLION DOLLARS. HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU TO GET THAT PLANT. CONSTRUCTED AND IS IT CURRENTLY RUNNING. SURE I AM HAPPY TO DRENCH STEERER- QUESTIONS- COMMITTEE MEMBER- THE PLANTWENT ONLINE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN IT WAS ABOUT A FOURTEEN YEAR- TIME LINE TO GET THE PROJECT FROM INCEPTION TO ACTUALLY IN OPERATIONS IT COST ABOUT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IT REPRESENTS ABOUT 10% OF OUR WATER SUPPLY. IT IS A BIT OUR MOST EXPENSIVE SOURCE OF SUPPLY BUT BECAUSE IT IS 10% OF THE SUPPLY WE MELT IT WITH OUR OTHER SOURCES OF WATER- TO PROVIDE A MELTED RATE- WHICH IS MUCH MORE MODERATE. TAKE OUT OF THAT ONE BILLION DOLLARS WHAT WAS THE LEGAL COSTS THAT YOU HAD TO SPEND FOR ALL THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU FACED. I DON'T HAVE THAT FIGURE RIGHT OFF THE TOP- WE THIS WAS A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP- THE DEVELOPER WENT THROUGH THE LEGAL- LAWSUITS- FOURTEEN LAWSUITS- BEFORE- THIS PROJECT COULD COME TO FRUITION- THOSE WERE CARRIED AS THE- PRE DEVELOPMENT COSTS- WHICH DID. UGH GET. FOLDED INTO THE ENTIRE COST OF THE PROJECT I CAN GET BACK TO YOU BUT- THAT'S CERTAINLY TIME AND MONEY- INVOLVED IN THAT EFFORT- TO GET THE PLANT UP AND RUNNING. IT IN HOW MANY. ACRE HOW MANY ACRE FEET OF WATER DO YOU. ARE YOU ABLE TO PROCESS FOR THAT COST. IT'S SAD SIX THOUSAND ACRE FEET- AND THE- COSTS FOR ACRE FOOT- INCLUDING A TEN MILE PIPELINE THAT HAD TO BE- CONSTRUCTED TO GET TO OUR- WATER PIPELINES- FOR DISTRIBUTION- THE PER ACRE FOOT COST IS TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS AN ACRE FOOT AGAIN IT IS OUR MOST EXPENSIVE SUPPLY BUT WHEN BLENDED WITH OUR OTHER CHEAPER SOURCES OF WATER- IF WE'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE- A RATE THAT IS MORE MODERATE THAN IF WE- BEEN FULLY A LITTLE OVER TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS PER ACRE FOOT THE HER DIRECT TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND. FIFTY DOLLARS PER ACRE BUT SEVEN HUNDRED. AND I WOULD CONSIDER THAT OF NOT IS EXPENSIVE IN MY DISTRICT BECAUSE YOU CAN RUN BETWEEN FOUR AND FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AN ACRE FEET. OR NOT THE CELL BUT AS JUST OF WATER RIGHTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND THEN I WANT TO ASK A- OF MISTER. DEL VOCE. IF I SAY THAT RIGHT. BEAUJOLAIS MOSQUE. THE QUESTION IN REGARDS TO A BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND YOU ARE ON A OF WATER COMMISSION. WHAT IS YOUR OPINION AND THE IMPACT YOUR ABILITY TO MOVE PROP ONE MONEY FORWARD FOR NEW STORAGE IN A MORE TIMELY MANNER. AND TO BE ABLE TO SPEED UP THAT PROCESS FOR US AND I THINK HE WAS IN THE HOUSE THANK YOU- JOE DEL BOSQUE- IT HAS BEEN. KIND OF SLOW IN MY OPINION OBVIOUSLY- HAS TO GO THROUGH- OF A LENGTHY PROCESS. TO GET APPROVED- IT TOOK A WHILE JUST TO GET. THE PROJECTS- EVALUATED BECAUSE THEY HAD TO MEET CERTAIN PARAMETERS FOR- FOR EVALUATION FOR PUBLIC BENEFITS. AND I'M NOT SURE AT THIS POINT IF THERE'S ANY OF THEM UNDER CONSTRUCTION I THINK I THINK THAT THERE'S A GROUNDWATER BANK IN KERN COUNTY THAT IS. I THINK ALREADY LIKE ALMOST READY TO GO. OTHER THAN THAT- I DON'T KNOW OF ANY OTHERS. PIC THANK YOU BECAUSE UP BY SET OF LAST FOUR YEARS A MOJAVE WATER AGENCY. AND WE'VE BEEN DOING UP IT'S A FACT THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH TO FOR GROUNDWATER STORAGE OF TRYING TO GET IT IN THE MOJAVE. OF RIVER VALLEY AREA MY- DISTRICT. AND THEN I'M GONNA JUST MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS. BECAUSE ON THE AGENDA BUT WE'VE DONE A LOT OF TALKING AGAIN RIGHT NOW. AND THAT'S pTALKING. WE NEED TO GET WATER STORAGE IN CALIFORNIA AND PART OF THE AGENDA SAYS IT CAP IT IS CALIFORNIA READY FOR ANOTHER DROUGHT. NO WE'RE ARE NOT PREPARED AGAIN FOR ANOTHER DROUGHT. BECAUSE WE DON'T STORE THE WATER FOR WHAT YEARS FOR WHEN WE NEEDED IN DROUGHT YEARS. SO I LIKE TO WORK WITH MY COLLEAGUES IN THE FUTURE ESPECIALLY ON THIS COMMITTEE. TO GET GROUNDWATER STORAGE ABOVE GROUND STORAGE BUT WE NEED STORAGE IN CALIFORNIA LOOK FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSION IN THE FUTURE. AND THANK YOU EDUARDO FOR DOING THIS COMMITTEE HEARING TODAY APPRECIATED. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIMILAR SMITH. CALLING THE SHOTS- MISTER. DEL BOSQUE. YES MINE'S DALLY SO I HAVE A LAST NAME LIKE IT'S HARD AS WELL. I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING YOUR STORY TODAY MY HUSBAND'S- FAMILY WERE HOMESTEADERS INTO WITH THE TO LAKE BASIN WHICH THEIR WATER HAS BEEN NOW. FROM THE FARMERS THERE HAD THEY'VE HAD ZERO ALLOCATION NOW MOVING FORWARD. SO AND IT'S NEAR AND DEAR TO OUR HEART AS FARMERS OURSELVES SO I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TRAVELING HERE TODAY AND SHARING YOUR STORY AND ALL OF YOUR THOUGHTS AND CONCERNS WITH THAT. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU- IT WAS WORTH DRIVING UP HERE TWO HOURS TO BE ABLE TO. TALK TO YOU FACE TO FACE I THOUGHT THAT THIS ISSUE IS. IS SO IMPORTANT FOR US BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN SUFFERING THESE DROUGHTS FOR TOO MANY YEARS. WE'VE HAD WATER REDUCTIONS ON OUR FARMS SINCE NINETEEN NINETY PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT. IN THE MOST SEVERE ONES HAVE HAPPENED SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND NINE- SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS. YOU KNOW HAS NOT REACHED MANY SOLUTIONS AND WE'RE WE'RE REALLY REALLY REACHING OUT FOR- SOMETHING THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE DONE NOW IS TO EXPEDITE TRANSFERS SO WE CAN GET THE WATER IN TIME TO GET THE CROPS TO GROW THROUGH THE SUMMER. BECAUSE WE'RE PLANTING CROPS AND WE ONLY HAVE ENOUGH WATER TO GET TO JULY. AND THE REST OF THE WATER THAT WE NEED IS HUNG UP IN THE TRANSFER. SO WE WOULD CERTAINLY APPRECIATE IF ANYTHING COULD BE DONE THERE TO EXPEDITE THAT. AND OF COURSE WE NEED THOSE LONG TERM PROJECTS- ARE SOME OF THOSE PRICE X. THAT WERE. BY THE CALIFORNIA WATER COMING. WERE UNFORTUNATELY NOT WHAT THEY WERE KIND OF UNDER FUNDED SOME OF THESE PROJECTS NEEDED MORE FUNDS. OF THE PRIVATE THE PROPONENTS. DID NOT HAVE THE FUNDING BECAUSE THE OF PROP ONE FUNDS FELL SHORTER. OF BOARD FOR THEM THEN THEY REALLY NEEDED TO GET TO MAKE IT GO. AND SO THAT'S WHY I THINK THAT THIS IS A GOOD TIME FOR THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO COME IN. AND HELP THEM WITH THOSE ADDITIONAL FUNDS. OF PROJECTS LIKE TEMPERANCE FLAT. GOT A VERY PITIFUL AMOUNT I THINK THEY GOT LIKE A HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION. AND THE PROJECT COST LIKE MAYBE TWO TWO BILLION. SO THEY WERE WELL WELL SHORT OF FUNDING AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE NOW HOPEFULLY. AND MAYBE GET THOSE PROJECTS STARTED. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. THANK YOU I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR SANDY WITH THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY WATER AGENCY AND- THIS IS IN RELATION TO COLORADO RIVER- DROUGHT CIRCUMSTANCES I MEAN HOW IS THE WATER AGENCY AND HOW DO YOU SEE OTHER. WATER AGENCIES- THAT DEPEND ON A RIVER ALLOCATIONS ARE PREPARING. AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME FOR- WHAT'S TO COME. YES AND PREPARING FOR THE CUTBACKS AND THE FIRST TO TAKE THOSE CUTBACKS WILL BE OF THE STATE OF ARIZONA- THERE'S A LOT OF EFFORT TALKING ABOUT WATER EFFICIENCY MEASURES- ALONG. ALL OF THE- BASIN STATES WHO RELY ON THE COLORADO RIVER AND SO- THERE'S A HUGE EFFORT IN THAT REGARD- I THINK THAT- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I HOPE HAPPENS OUT OF THIS DROUGHT IS WE- HAVE MORE COMMUNICATION AND BETTER- SHARING OF WATER MANAGEMENT AS I MENTIONED WE'RE LOOKING TO BE ABLE TO STORE. SOME OF OUR ALLOCATION OF COLORADO RIVER WATER IN LAKE MEAD FOR PROVIDE A HIGHER ELEVATION THERE- AND BE ABLE TO USE THAT WATER- WORK APPROPRIATELY- WHEN WE NEED TO AND IT COULD PROVIDE A SOLUTION ON THE RIVER- FOR. THE FOLKS WHO ARE RELYING ON IT SO- YOU KNOW THERE'S MANY CONVERSATIONS GOING ON A LOT OF WORK HAPPENING IN THE AND- VERY SIMILAR CHALLENGES TO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IN IN. CALIFORNIA- SO I THINK YOU HAVE THAT'S I WOULD END WITHOUT. ARE THERE ANY ARE THERE ANY SPECIFIC MEASURES THAT THE YOUR AGENCY IS ALREADY TAKING ON- AS YOU ANTICIPATE- TIMES HAVE COME IN FROM BOTH THE STATE AND TO AS DE ALLOCATION RESTRICTIONS OR FOR THAT MATTER THE- CIRCUMSTANCES OF. THE COLORADO RIVER- DROP. YEAH WE CONTINUE TO HAVE VERY STRONG WATER USE EFFICIENCY AS I MENTIONED WE'VE DROPPED OUR PER CAPITA USE BY CONTINUE TO INVEST IN- EFFICIENT USE OF WATER- FOCUSING ON OUTDOOR LANDSCAPING ASSISTING RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES AND TRANSFORMING. THEIR LANDSCAPE- TWO MORE DROUGHT TOLERANT- OPTIONS AND WE'VE HAD HUGE SUCCESS WITHOUT AS WELL AS PROVIDING TRAINING CLASSES FOR RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES AS WELL AS LANDSCAPERS TO HELP A HELP IN THAT TRANSFORMATION PROCESS THOUGH WE CONTINUE TO HAVE A HEAVY EMPHASIS ON- ADDED. EFFICIENCY AS WELL AS SUPPORTING IN OUR MEMBER AGENCIES AS THEY MOVE FORWARD TO DEVELOP- PURE WATER PROJECTS ARE POSSIBLE REUSE PROJECTS- IT REALLY AGAIN LOOKING FORWARD TO THE STATE REGULATIONS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO STREAMLINE TO GO TO DIRECT POTABLE REUSE PROJECTS. THANK YOU FOR SHARING- WHAT YOUR AGENCY IS AS DOING- IN A PROACTIVE MANNER QUESTION FOR US TO FIND OF THE AND THE RECENT WATER BOARD NEEDS ASSESSMENT SHOWS A LOT OF SMALL. WHAT DO YOU. I BELIEVE WE SHOULD BE DOING ARE YOU MENTIONED PRIORITIZING REGIONAL- PARTS OF THE STATE- TO ENSURE THAT THESE PROACTIVE MEASURES AND INVESTMENTS GO FIRST- DO YOU HAVE MORE SPECIFICS THAT YOU COULD SHARE WITH US- FOR OUR CONSIDERATION AS WE ARE HAVING THESE THESE THESE DISCUSSIONS AS WE AS AN ASSEMBLY- WORKING WITH MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE PUT FORWARD OUR- DROUGHT RESILIENCY PACKAGE- IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS- THAT WOULD HELP- WITH- COLLECTIVE EFFORTS THAT BILL FOR THE SENATE HAS PUT FORWARD. WOULD LOVE TO HEAR MORE SPECIFICS ON YOUR AND IN TERMS OF HOW WE ARE MORE INTENTIONAL WITH- PRIORITIZING THESE COMMUNITIES THAT YOU SPEAK OF AND YOUR- PRESENTATION. ABSOLUTELY GERMAN ARMY I LIKE JUST YOU KNOW POINT OUT THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH DATA TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE HAVE THE SYSTEMS WITHOUT PROGRAM WHERE WE HAVE THE SYSTEM THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY NOT PROVIDING SAFE DRINKING WATER. MORE IMPORTANTLY THE MOST RECENT REPORT JUST RELEASED A REALLY GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE WE HAVE SYSTEM AT RISK OF NOT HAVING SAFE DRINKING WATER SO. WE SHOULD NOT WAIT TO DO MORE STUDIES ON FIGURE OUT WHERE WE HAVE THE SYSTEM CERTAIN COMMUNITIES AT RISK OF LOSING WATER COMPLETELY I DON'T WANT TO BE VERY INTENTIONAL AND TARGETED THE RESOURCE. RIGHT NOW GET READY FOR THIS DROUGHT INSURE THAT RESIDENTS ARE AWARE OF THE RESOURCES THAT WE WILL HAVE AVAILABLE FOR THEM. SO THAT WE HAVE A VERY GOOD QUARTER TO PLAN WE HAVE STRONG COMMUNICATION SO THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO SUFFER AND SCRAMBLE ON WHO TO CALL WHEN. WELLS GO DRY. AND IT VERY WELL ISSUE THE WORST. WITH AN AYE AYE WANT TO SAY THAT. AS WE CONTINUE TO LIVE IN THE STATE WERE DROUGHT WILL BE. THE NEW NORMAL WE NEED TO REALLY INVEST IN DROUGHT RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE. SO THAT WE ENSURE. THAT THESE COMMUNITIES CONSISTING WITH STRANGERS. AND I THINK WE CAN DO THAT. THANK YOU FOR SHARING. YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT- ONE I THEN GO TO A DAVID- YOUR REGION HAS BEEN HIT HARD BY THE WILDFIRE IN RECENT YEARS. WHAT HAS THAT MEANT FOR YOUR WATER AGENCIES ABILITY TO DELIVER THE WATER FOR YOUR COMMUNITIES AND FARMERS IN PARTICULAR AS- YOU KNOW WE CONTINUE TO FACE THIS. SITUATION SUPERVISOR- DAVID RIGHT TO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE QUESTION OBVIOUSLY IS ADDED- COMPLEXITY TO THE- THE WATER SYSTEM AND THE DEMANDS THERE AND- LIKE I SAID- YOU KNOW THE DROUGHT. HAS AFFECTED- WATER SUPPLY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY- ED PONDS THAT ARE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY OR A VALUABLE PLACES FOR HELICOPTERS TO DIP THEIR BUCKETS AND GET THE WATER FOR. OF FIGHTING THIS FIRE SO- LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH OUR STATE PARTNERS TO BE ABLE TO- HAVE PROGRAMS AVAILABLE RESILIENCY SAKE BUT ALSO FOR FIREFIGHTING SAKE- TO BE ABLE TO- YOU KNOW MAKE SURE THAT THOSE PLANS WERE AVAILABLE- IN DROUGHT YEARS IN FIRE SEASONS OF GOING FORWARD- AND AGAIN I LIKE I MENTIONED EARLIER- THE WATERSHED. THE HEALTH OF THE WATERSHED IS VITALLY IMPORTANT TO THE HEALTH OF THE OF THE RIVERS AND RESERVOIRS AND- AFTER FIRE. THE GROUND BECOMES- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY VERY TOXIC WITH A LOT OF RUNOFF WE JUMP ON THOSE THINGS VERY QUICKLY BUT YOU CAN'T CONTROL EVERYTHING AND YOU'RE CONSTANTLY- BEING CHALLENGED ESPECIALLY WITH THE SIZE AND SCALE OF THE- FIRES THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED IN THIS COUNTY I DO APPRECIATE THAT QUESTION LIKE EVERYTHING IT'S RESOURCES AND IT'S MAKING SURE THAT YOU'RE PLANNING. OF PLANNING. AHEAD AND HAVING THOSE RESOURCES ON HAND. THANK YOU SO MUCH I HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES. DOES WELL BUT- WE DO WANT TO JUST ACKNOWLEDGE AND THANK YOU ALL OF THE PANELISTS WHO ARE. VENTURA GET SOME GOOD TIME WITH US ON THIS IMPORTANT SUBJECT.

OUR OBJECTIVES WITH OUR COUNTERPARTS IN THE- OTHER HOUSE TO ENSURE. THAT THE CALIFORNIA PUTS HIS BEST FOOT FORWARD. IN A MONTH PROACTIVE MANNER THAT WE CAN WE CLEARLY HEARD TODAY. THAT WE'VE GOT A LOT OF A LOT OF WORK TO DO. AND IN THAT AREA. SEEN THAT THERE AREN'T ANY MORE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AGAIN THANK ALL THE PANELISTS WE'RE GOING TO. ASK THE MODERATOR- TO. LET US KNOW.

WE DID SUBMIT A COMMENT LETTER ON THE TOPIC TO THE COMMITTEE AS WELL FOR MEMBERS RUBIO THERE WAS ONE ASPECT OF OUR COMMENTS THAT I WANTED TO EMPHASIZE BASED ON THE CONVERSATION TODAY. OF COURSE THE PORTS THE LEGISLATURE'S EFFORT TO ENACT BOTH DROUGHT REALLY FUNDING IN THE BUDGET PROCESS THIS YEAR TO ADDRESS IMMEDIATE CHALLENGES. AND A CLIMATE RESILIENT FONG THAT INCLUDES FUNDING FOR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE THAT INCLUDING IMPROVED WATER SUPPLY RELIABILITY AT CALIFORNIA FACES THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE INCLUDING DROUGHT. BOTH OF THESE ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AS WE PREPARE FOR CURRENT THE FOR CURRENT CONDITIONS AND MAKE LONGER TERM INVESTMENTS REPAIR FOR FUTURE CHALLENGES DUE TO CLIMATE. CHANGE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OUR NEXT COMMENT JUST FROM LINE ONE TWENTY SEVEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON TO THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE MICHAEL CLAIBORNE LEADERSHIP COUNSEL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE NONPROFIT BUSINESS OUR CANDIDATES COACHELLA VALLEY. I'D SAY THIS IS A TIMELY CONVERSATION AND THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE FOR BRINGING IT UP TODAY- DROUGHT CONDITIONS WORK ARE WORSENING. AND IT BECOMING EVER MORE CLEAR THAT MORE FREQUENT AND SEVERE DROUGHTS IS THE NEW NORMAL. DURING THE LAST DROUGHT THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS BLOCKED ACCESS TO DRINKING WATER CAUGHT BY DROPPING DISHES THE GRAVEL GROUNDWATER UPPER POBRE PUMPING. MOSTLY BY AGRICULTURE. WE LEARNED A LOT DURING THE LAST DROUGHT. AND WE ALL TO DEVELOP ADDITIONAL TOOLS INCLUDING STATE MY THE FEEDBACK REPORT. THE DRINKING WATER NEEDS ASSESSMENT AT THE EIGHTY EIGHT MANDATORY CONSOLIDATION AT THAT THIRTY THE SAFER PROGRAM AND PICKING UP. THE QUESTION IS WILL WE FIND THAT EFFECTIVELY USE THE TOOL TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES AND HOUSEHOLDS ACCESS TO DRINKING WATER. FOR FUNDING WE NEED IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET STANGEL FUNDING FOR DRINKING WATER INFRASTRUCTURE THE STATE BOARD IDENTIFIED AT THE HAS BEEN MENTIONED FOUR POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS UNFUNDED NEED FOR DRINKING WATER INFRASTRUCTURE. FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING FOR DROUGHT RESILIENCE- THIRTY MILLION FOR PROACTIVE DROUGHT PLANNING. FUNDING FOR CIGNA IMPLEMENTATION FOCUSED ON DRINKING WATER AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND FUNDING FOR CONSERVATION INCLUDING DIRECT INSTALL PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION WE NEED A COORDINATED RESPONSE THAT INCLUDES STATE WATER BOARD D. W. R. O. YET U. S. B. A. AND GLOBAL JURISDICTIONS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS AND IMPACTED COMMUNITIES. AND OTHERS WITH RESPECT TO TAKE MY ONLY A STRONG AT THE LOCAL JET SKIS. AND A QUARTER UNFORTUNATELY MANY OF THOSE ARE NOT VERY GOOD CERTAINLY NOT THE ONE THAT JOAQUIN VALLEY. WE NEED TO KNOW YOU ARE IN THE STATE WATER BOARD TERRORISM STRONG REGULATORY BACKSTOP TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU. PROTECT ACCESS TO DRINKING WATER. DURING THE LAST DROUGHT AGRICULTURE A PLATE TWO THIRDS OF THEIR LOCK SERVICE WATER SUPPLY WITH ADDITIONAL GROUNDWATER PUMPING. AND A DIRECT RESULT HOUSEHOLD BLOCK BRING THE WATER. THIS IS IN THE CARE OF THE ISSUE EVEN DURING THE LAST DROUGHT THERE RIGHT ENOUGH WATER FOR DOMESTIC FLIGHTS. AND AGRICULTURE IF USED WISELY AND SUSTAINABLY. THERE'S ALSO A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL LEGAL TOOLS LIKE SENATOR LINDA CONSOLIDATES BELL AT BEFORE- THREE. WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE STATE WATER BOARD PROJECT PROACTIVELY FACILITATE AND MANDATE WATER CONSOLIDATION. OF IRAQ WATER SYSTEMS. AND WELLS BEFORE THEY FAILED. FINALLY THE LAST DROUGHT THIS. IMPACT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. PARTICULAR BUT CAN AND THE JOAQUIN. AFFECT DROUGHT RESPONSE SEPARATE DRINKING IS NOT JEFF AND- TO THAT IF. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION AS WE NAVIGATE THIS IMPENDING PROPERTY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A MODERATOR ANY OTHER CALLS IN THE QUEUE. YES WE HAVE FOUR BORING SHE WILL WEAR AROUND ONE THIRTY EIGHT PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M WENDY RIVER BUSH EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CAL DETAIL WE EDUCATE AND PROMOTE THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRACTICE IN SEAWATER DESALINATION WITH ANY MANAGEMENT CALIFORNIA. ONE OF THE KEY DROUGHT LESSONS LEARNED IS THAT OUR STATE MUST CHECK THE BOX ON ALL OF THE ABOVE IN TERMS OF WATER SUPPLIES. WHILE WATER MANAGERS WORK TOWARDS THIS IN MORE NORMAL WATER YEARS IT'S EVEN MORE CRITICAL WHEN WE CROSSED OVER THE THRESHOLD INTO DROUGHT. WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO CONSERVE AND IMPLEMENT WATER EFFICIENCY WE NEED TO EXERCISE MARC CONJUNCTIVE USE BETWEEN THE ABOVE GROUND AND GROUND WATER STORAGE. WE NEED TO RECYCLE WATER AND YES WE ALSO NEED TO UTILIZE BRACKISH AND SEAWATER DESALINATION WE DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY OF USING JUST ONE OR TWO SOURCES OF WATER SUPPLY WITH IN CALIFORNIA. WE MUST HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO USE THEM ALL PARTICULARLY IN A DROUGHT. WE'RE REALLY PROUD OF OUR MEMBERS THAT HAVE PERFORMED AND DO YOU PERFORM THE STEADY AND CHALLENGING WORK ON BRACKISH AND FEEDWATER DECELERATE CHECKED. SOMETIMES OVER TWENTY YEARS FROM PLANNING TO REGULATORY PERMITS THE CONSTRUCTION OPERATION AND DELIVERY OF DRINKING WATER WE NEED TO KEEP PURSUING THE SALAD ORDER TO CONTINUE TO DIVERSIFY OUR WATER SUPPLY PORTFOLIO. DEVELOP SECURE IT'S LOCAL IT'S A CLIMATE CHANGE AND DROUGHT RESILIENCE SOURCE OF NEW AND PURE WATER SUPPLY FOR GOLDEN. STATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WONDER THREE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ARE VERY NIELSEN WITH THE GOLDEN STATE SALMON ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING THE ENTIRE CALIFORNIA SALMON FISHING INDUSTRY OUR INDUSTRY IN SUPPORT OF ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL-ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. TWENTY THREE THOUSAND JOBS WITH OUR SEVEN RUNS ARE HEALTHY UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S NOT THE CASE TODAY AND LIKELY WON'T BE THE CASE FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THE LAST DROUGHT THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE CALIFORNIA SENATE NATURAL RESOURCES SUFFERED AS A SECTOR MORE THAN ANY OTHER SECTOR. THAT INCLUDES THE FISHING INDUSTRY BOB AND THERE IS UNFORTUNATELY A RISK OF SIMILARLY CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE TO NATURAL RESOURCES IN THE FISHING INDUSTRY DURING THIS DROUGHT I LIKE TO THINK JUST FOUR QUICK POINTS. SEARCHES THAT ARE SEVEN RUN HAVE RECOVERED FROM OUR LAST DROP OF THE SALMON FISHING SEASON COMMERCIAL AND RECREATIONAL FOR THIS HERE- IS ABOUT SIXTY FROM MOST OF THE STATE 6265% OR MORE OF LESS THAN A NORMAL SEASON ABOUT THE SEASON IS DONE MORE THAN CUT IN HALF. ALSO GOING INTO THIS YEAR FISHING FAMILIES BUSINESSES AND COMMUNITIES ARE FACING REAL HARDSHIPS SECOND POINT- MISTER DOUBLE WITH CDFW MENTION THE TRUCKING OF JUVENILE FISH TO INCREASE THE SURVIVAL OF HATCHERY FISH THIS YEAR- BOB WE'RE PLEASED TO SEE THAT TRUCKING WE CALL OUR ORGANIZATION CALLED FOR THE TRUCKING WE STRONGLY SUPPORTED. THAT ACTION IS ON LIFE SUPPORT MEASURE THAT YOU NEEDED BECAUSE WE'VE LET OUR MEMBERS BECOME LEGAL FOR BABY SALMON AND OUR INDUSTRY DEPENDS ON HEALTHY RIVERS. BOB GOOD POINT IS REGARDING TEMPERATURE CONDITIONS FOR SALMON THIS YEAR MR BG WITHIN ARE YOU SEE MENTIONED THIS IN HIS TESTIMONY I'M BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TWENTY FIFTEEN WE LOST MORE THAN 90% OF OUR NATURAL SPAWNING WHERE RUN AND FALL RUN SALMON ON THE SACRAMENTO THIS WAS SEEN AS ONE OF THE GREATEST FAILURES DURING THE LAST DROUGHT. WE CAN SEE THAT SAME SORT OF LOS AGAIN THIS YEAR MOST. THE STATE BOARD ACTS IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF TO INCREASE KEPT PROTECTION FOR SALMON BOWL YESTERDAY. IN THE FINAL. THE CURRENT SET OF STE. BOARD HELLO STANDARDS FOR BATTLE TO SYSTEM. TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD AND THOSE STANDARDS IN SIMPLE FAILED. AND THAT FAILURE IS MORE CLEAR DURING DRY. ON THE STATE BORDERS BEEN WAITING NOW FOR YEARS FOR VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS- THAT WOULD REPLACE TRADITIONAL STANDARDS THOSE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS APPEAR NOT TO BE FORTHCOMING. NEW STATE BOARD STANDARDS OF ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL DROUGHT PREPARATION MEASURES FOR THE ECOSYSTEM IN THE FISHING INDUSTRY. I AND IT'S PAST TIME FOR THE SUPPORT OF FINALIZE AND IMPLEMENT NEW STANDARDS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO SPEAK TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU I ONE THIRTY SEVEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON SURE NUMBERS DJANGO PROVIDING COMMENTS ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA TROUT TROUT UNLIMITED AN ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND ALL THESE ORGANIZATIONS ARE GRATEFUL TO THE COMMITTEE FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING AND RECOGNIZING THE DROUGHT CONVERGENCES AN ACCURATE ASSESSMENT OF IF WE'RE PREPARED IS ESSENTIAL TO STRATEGICALLY MANAGING INVESTMENT. BUT THERE'S ALSO A NEED TO BE SWEPT IN MAKING SMART INSIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS WHERE WE IDENTIFIED THEY'RE NEEDED ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA TRACKING PROBLEM LIMITED I WANTED TO RAISE THAT IN ADDITION TO FUNDING WHICH WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE FOR SHRINK WHILE ENHANCEMENT THE COSTA MONITORING PROGRAM AND OTHER WATER QUALITY ACTIVITIES THAT WE'VE OUTLINEDIN A LETTER SUBMITTED TO THE LEGISLATURE. THERE'S ALSO A NEED FOR CHANGES IN STATUTE TO STREAMLINE A LOT OF THIS WORK ON BEHALF OF ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THE NEED FOR STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT EXACTLY. TECHNOLOGY WHICH INCLUDES AFRICA ADVANCE STRATEGICALLY UNDER PURPOSING AN ECLIPSE GROWERS WITH THE TOOLS AND ASSISTANCE NECESSARY TO SUSTAINABLY MANAGE WATER AGAIN WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR PRO PROMPTING THE CONVERSATION IN ALLOWING US PRIDE PRIDE COMMENTS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AND ENSURE THE STATE IS PREPARED FOR AND RESILIENCY THROUGHOUT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I'M MORE THIRTY NINE. YEAH GOOD AFTERNOON CHEN BIRDS NAME IS CRYSTAL BALL FLETCHER. ACTIONS OUR COMMUNICATION WITH OTHER AND YOU HAVE BEEN I. AND WORKING THE STATE ONE BOARD IN THE- FOR MORE. DROPPED INTEREST PLAN- YOU KNOW I WHAT WE'VE HEARD. WE A CRIB A COMPANY APPROACH TO ADDRESS FOCUS. OR LONG TERM IMPACTS TO WATER QUALITY WATER ACCESS AND ARE EAGER- AND IN ORDER TO DELIVER THE HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER AND PROTECT EVERY. RESIDENTS RIGHT TO CLEAN WATER WE MUST ENSURE BOTH ONE STATE AGENCY OFFICIALS COURTNEY PARIS FONG. AND I PREPARE TO LIVE WATER SUPPLY EQUIPMENT AND RESOURCES TO- IMPACTED COMMUNITIES. ARE WHY WE ARE THE LEGISLATURE TO SCORE AT THE BARBECUE WHICH WILL HELP DROUGHT. SEEING CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES WILL HELP PREVENT CATASTROPHIC WATER SHORTAGES. WATER SHORTAGES BY IMPROVE THE LOCAL PLANNING INCREASING DATA COLLECTION UPDATING ORIGINALLY. EMERGENCY RESPONSE OF. AN IMPROVING STATEWIDE COORDINATION. ENGINE I A PANEL OF BURGLAR ALARM BANK I WOULD WATER CENTER HAD GREATLY HOBDAY ALREADY. RIGHT HE'S STILL DOING MORE BUT WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW WITH THE DATE THE NEW DELHI PARKWAY WATERBORNE DROUGHT WITH. AND THE STATE WATER BOARD DOESN'T MATTER. FOR- WHAT DOES NATION AT WAR WITH GERMANY AND- THE NEXT DROUGHT LEVEL INTEREST FOR MOST ONE Q. AFTER THE WAR AND LIKE TO TRY YOU KNOW BACK TO GROW WATER AND- HAD- PANEL I THINK. OF THE VERY NAY. BY WATER CRITICAL TRIAL BURKE DURING DRY YEARS AGO SEEING ABOUT SIXTY OF CALIFORNIA Y. QUITE. GOT WATER. THEREFORE IS SIMPLE THAT WE NOT. I WANTED TO BE ABLE. TO PLEASE ACTUALLY OF WORK YOU THINK OF BILL WILL DIE. DROUGHT CONDITIONS- AND ONE OF THE LONG EMISSIONS. WITH THE TWENTY YEAR. TIME FRAME THE CHIEF SOMETHING- SO I'LL PEOPLE ARE YOU ARE THE WATER. AND THERE ARE WILD OUT BY DRY- EVEN NOW RIGHT AND WE NEED TO GET SUPPORT OUR MOST IMPACTED. BY END OF THE OF LOCAL. TO MANAGE OUR- BELIEF. OF HELPING PEOPLE YOUR ENGAGED COLD AT THE PORT DISCUSSION TOP OF. AND WE. NUMBER THIS IS MARK SMITH ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA WATER FROM THE GROUND PLAN WATER DISTRICT WANTED TO TOUCH BRIEFLY ON THE IMPACT OF DROUGHT WILL BE HAVING TO WILDLIFE REFUGES AND THE PACIFIC FLYWAY. IMPACTS ON MIGRATORY BIRDS AS YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA IS THE HEART OF THE PACIFIC FLYWAY WHICH STRETCHES FROM THE TIP OF ALASKA DOWN TO SOUTH AMERICA. IN YOUR CALIFORNIA FROM THE KLAMATH TO THE SALTON SEA AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN. THIS YEAR WILDLIFE REFUGES ARE SLATED TO RECEIVE LESS THAN 60% OF THEIR TOTAL WATER SUPPLY. THE WEAPON MANAGERS ARE HAVING A HARD TIME WITH THE MANAGEMENT. OF THEIR WEAPONS THAT YOU KNOW OUR WEAPONS HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED FROM FLOWS AND THEY ARE MANAGE WEAPONS WE HAVE TO MOVE THE WATER TO THAT AND PUT THE WATER ON THEM AND WE NEED THAT. WEBER MANAGERS OF PRESERVING LIMITED SUPPLIES FOR PEAK MIGRATION THE BALL INSTEAD OF PROVIDING FOR SPRING IRRIGATION AND SUMMER BREEDING HABITAT. IS INABILITY TO IRRIGATE AND PROVIDE BREEDING HABITAT REDUCES THE PRODUCTIVITY OF THE MARCH INCREASE WILDLIFE HEALTH AND BREEDING IMPACTS. GIVEN THE LIMITED WATER SUPPLY THE WEAPONS COMPLEXES WILL GO DRY FOR PROLONGED PERIODS OF TIME. AND OVERCROWDING OF MIGRATORY WATERFOWL WILL BE GREATLY INCREASED ON THIS DRAMATICALLY REDUCE WHAT ONE FOUR CORRECT YOU MAY BE AWARE THAT THE CLAMOR. WHAT THE DRIEST IT IS EVER BEEN THIS LAST YEAR AND WE HAD A BOTULISM OUTBREAK THAT KILLED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF BIRDS THE OVERCROWDING. IT'S JUST HORRIBLE FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE. THIS DROUGHT WILL BE ESPECIALLY SEVERE FOR WILDLIFE REFUGES THAT NEED TO RECEIVE ADEQUATE WATER SUPPLIES ON THE SCHEDULE. TO BE THEIR MOST PRODUCTIVE TO MILLIONS OF MIGRATORY BIRDS THAT WILL COME THIS YEAR REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE WATER. IT'S LIKE HAVING A GROCERY STORE WITH THE LIGHTS ON BUT NO FOOD ON THE SHELVES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION AND TO HOLDING THIS HEARING TODAY WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THESE ISSUES. GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU HAVE NOT CRIME SINK AT THIS.
