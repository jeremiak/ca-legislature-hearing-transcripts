00:35:08.105 --> 00:35:10.007
MUCH MUCH. MORE IMPORTANT TO

00:35:10.074 --> 00:35:11.843
THE ECONOMY AND IT'S AT

00:35:11.909 --> 00:35:14.512
COMMERCE ISSUE- WE DON'T HAVE

00:35:14.579 --> 00:35:16.614
THE ABILITY TO REGULATE THOSE

00:35:16.681 --> 00:35:18.115
ENTITIES THAT ARE JUST

00:35:18.182 --> 00:35:19.984
PROVIDING INTERNET SERVICES

00:35:20.051 --> 00:35:21.352
WHAT WE DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO

00:35:21.419 --> 00:35:24.956
REGULATE. IS THE ART THE VIDEO-

00:35:25.022 --> 00:35:27.658
THE VIDEO SERVICES AND SO- THE

00:35:27.725 --> 00:35:29.460
REASON WE CAN GET INTO LOOKING

00:35:29.527 --> 00:35:31.429
AT WHERE THE SERVICE IS BEEN

00:35:31.496 --> 00:35:34.398
PROVIDED QUITE FRANKLY. IS THIS

00:35:34.465 --> 00:35:36.734
PANDEMIC HAS AT SENDING US ALL

00:35:36.801 --> 00:35:39.270
HOME AND THEN REQUIRING.

00:35:39.337 --> 00:35:41.272
EDUCATION TO HAPPEN THROUGH THE

00:35:41.339 --> 00:35:44.141
INTERNET REALLY. HIGHLIGHTED

00:35:44.208 --> 00:35:46.043
THE FACT THAT OUR SERVICES ARE

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:52.083
NOT. EQUALLY. OR- RIGHT IN

00:35:52.149 --> 00:35:52.783
EVERYTHING COMMUNITY AND OP

00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:54.085
LIKE IT SHOULD BE SO THERE'S A

00:35:54.151 --> 00:35:55.920
NUMBER OF ISSUES RELATED TO HOW

00:35:55.987 --> 00:35:57.488
ARE WE GOING TO GET THERE- THAT

00:35:57.555 --> 00:35:58.589
I WON'T GO INTO BUT THE BOTTOM

00:35:58.656 --> 00:35:59.524
LINE IS THAT WHAT WE CAN

00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:01.859
REGULATE. IT IS THE VIDEO

00:36:01.926 --> 00:36:04.328
SERVICES AND WE KNOW WHERE

00:36:04.395 --> 00:36:07.498
THOSE ARE LOCATED- BASED ON THE

00:36:07.565 --> 00:36:09.767
BUNDLING THAT'S BEEN DONE. WITH

00:36:09.834 --> 00:36:11.836
WITH THE PACKAGES THAT ALSO

00:36:11.903 --> 00:36:13.304
PROVIDE INTERNET INTERNET

00:36:13.371 --> 00:36:15.773
SERVICES SO. WHAT PART OF THE

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:18.175
CHALLENGE WITH HOW. INFORMATION

00:36:18.242 --> 00:36:21.712
IS REPORTED TO THE CPSC. IS

00:36:21.779 --> 00:36:23.514
THAT IT'S DONE AS A SERVICE

00:36:23.581 --> 00:36:25.449
AREA SO A COMPANY COMES IN THIS

00:36:25.516 --> 00:36:26.250
IS I'M GONNA PROVIDE SERVICE TO

00:36:26.317 --> 00:36:28.085
THIS AREA. I'M ON I DIDN'T

00:36:28.152 --> 00:36:29.420
BRING MY MAPS BECAUSE THIS IS

00:36:29.487 --> 00:36:30.721
THAT'S NOT THE SUBJECT AREA OF

00:36:30.788 --> 00:36:32.423
THIS- COMMITTEE BUT I'M MORE

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:34.692
THAN HAPPY TO SHOW YOU. IF WE

00:36:34.759 --> 00:36:36.694
WITH SOME REAL SPECIFIC DATA

00:36:36.761 --> 00:36:38.729
WHAT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN.

00:36:38.796 --> 00:36:41.198
WHAT THE- COMPANY SAY THEY'RE

00:36:41.265 --> 00:36:43.601
PROVIDING IN A SERVICE AREA AND

00:36:43.668 --> 00:36:46.304
THEN. WELL THE INFORMATION WHEN

00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:47.405
YOU COMPARE IT TO WITH THE SEC

00:36:47.471 --> 00:36:49.874
IS GETTING. ON ON IT LOOKS LIKE

00:36:49.941 --> 00:36:51.676
SWISS SWISS CHEESE IS WHAT IT

00:36:51.742 --> 00:36:53.778
AMOUNTS TO. THESE COMPANIES.

00:36:53.844 --> 00:36:56.280
THAT ARE PARTICIPATING IN IT AS

00:36:56.347 --> 00:36:59.617
PART OF THE P. C. P. C- HAVE A

00:36:59.684 --> 00:37:01.452
RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE THEY

00:37:01.519 --> 00:37:02.186
WERE GIVEN A VERY VALUABLE

00:37:02.253 --> 00:37:04.989
FRANCHISE. AND THE FRANCHISE

00:37:05.056 --> 00:37:06.958
TOOK AWAY THE ABILITY OF LOCAL

00:37:07.024 --> 00:37:09.160
GOVERNMENT. TO HAVE A SAY IN

00:37:09.226 --> 00:37:11.028
HOW BAD VIDEO CONFERENCING

00:37:11.095 --> 00:37:12.663
SERVICES IT WAS DEPLOYED I

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:14.131
REMEMBER BECAUSE I WAS ON THE

00:37:14.198 --> 00:37:14.665
CITY COUNCIL THEY HAD TO

00:37:14.732 --> 00:37:17.168
NEGOTIATE WITH US. AND AND

00:37:17.234 --> 00:37:18.669
INSTEAD THEY GOT A STATE WIDE

00:37:18.736 --> 00:37:20.237
FRANCHISE AND THE AGREEMENT

00:37:20.304 --> 00:37:21.372
THEY MADE AT THE TIME WAS THEY

00:37:21.439 --> 00:37:22.773
WOULDN'T DISCRIMINATE AGAINST

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:23.941
COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T THEY

00:37:24.008 --> 00:37:26.243
DON'T HAVE MONEY. AND SO THE C.

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:27.111
P. U. C. IS RENEWING THEIR

00:37:27.178 --> 00:37:29.413
FRANCHISE AGREEMENT AND YET

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:29.981
THEY'RE THEY'RE BEING GIVEN

00:37:30.047 --> 00:37:32.683
DATED THAT IS. NOT DOES NOT

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:34.118
GIVE THEM THE ABILITY TO KNOW

00:37:34.185 --> 00:37:35.586
WHETHER THERE THERE'S

00:37:35.653 --> 00:37:36.587
COMMUNITIES BE DISCRIMINATE OR

00:37:36.654 --> 00:37:38.255
NOT. SO THIS BILL PUTS LOCAL

00:37:38.322 --> 00:37:39.890
GOVERNMENT BACK AT THE TABLE

00:37:39.957 --> 00:37:42.593
DURING THOSE THOSE REVIEWS OF

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:44.128
THE OF THE LICENSING. SO MUCH

00:37:44.195 --> 00:37:47.198
AS I'D LIKE TO- REGULATE ALL OF

00:37:47.264 --> 00:37:48.633
THE COMPANIES WE JUST DON'T

00:37:48.699 --> 00:37:50.368
HAVE THAT AUTHORITY. CURRENT

00:37:50.434 --> 00:37:52.703
LAW IN- IN TERMS OF FEDERAL

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:53.871
PREEMPTION SO YEAH AND I

00:37:53.938 --> 00:37:56.507
UNDERSTAND THAT BY VIRTUE OF.

00:37:56.574 --> 00:37:59.343
JUST THE WAY THINGS ARE AND THE

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:03.047
WAY THINGS ARE SET UP- ME ABOUT

00:38:03.114 --> 00:38:04.148
TO THE STATE LEVEL AND FEDERAL

00:38:04.215 --> 00:38:06.717
LEVEL- THE WAY THAT WE REGULATE

00:38:06.784 --> 00:38:08.352
THINGS. I GUESS THE ISSUE IS

00:38:08.419 --> 00:38:11.188
THAT. ALL THESE PLAYERS ARE

00:38:11.255 --> 00:38:12.256
PART OF THE SOLUTION AND HAVE

00:38:12.323 --> 00:38:14.158
TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. AND

00:38:14.225 --> 00:38:15.760
IN FACT I MEAN NOW I MEAN IT I

00:38:15.826 --> 00:38:17.395
THINK IT'S EVEN BEEN EXPANDED

00:38:17.461 --> 00:38:19.130
YOU KNOW WITH THEM. YOU KNOW

00:38:19.196 --> 00:38:22.066
THE- STARLIGHT TECHNOLOGY

00:38:22.133 --> 00:38:25.670
THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT ON- NEARBY.

00:38:25.736 --> 00:38:26.303
YOU KNOW I MUST COMPANY THAT HE

00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:28.673
STARTED. IT MAY BE THAT WE YOU

00:38:28.739 --> 00:38:30.341
KNOW THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY GET

00:38:30.408 --> 00:38:31.809
HIGHER SPEEDS THERE IS AN

00:38:31.876 --> 00:38:34.045
ARTICLE RECENTLY THAT- IN TAMA

00:38:34.111 --> 00:38:36.814
COUNTY WHICH I REPRESENT- THIS

00:38:36.881 --> 00:38:37.848
IS BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE

00:38:37.915 --> 00:38:42.453
INTERNET SPEEDS BY OVER 510050%

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:44.021
AT WHICH WOULD BE HUGE RIGHT

00:38:44.088 --> 00:38:45.890
AND SO MAYBE IT'S NOT A FIBER

00:38:45.956 --> 00:38:46.691
OPTION YOU KNOW A LOT OF THESE

00:38:46.757 --> 00:38:48.793
COMPANIES ARE. THERE IN THE

00:38:48.859 --> 00:38:52.363
FIBER WORLD RIGHT. AND YEAH BUT

TO AND WIRELESS AND OTHER.

00:38:56.634 --> 00:38:58.469
ENTITIES THAT ARE REALLY PART

00:38:58.536 --> 00:38:59.070
OF THIS I FEEL LIKE IT'S KIND

00:38:59.136 --> 00:39:01.505
OF. WE'RE ONLY FOCUSING ON ONE

00:39:01.572 --> 00:39:03.474
PART WHEN THERE'S A BIGGER

00:39:03.541 --> 00:39:04.108
PICTURE HERE YOU KNOW SO THAT'S

00:39:04.175 --> 00:39:06.811
WHY. ONE OF MY CONCERNS I GUESS

00:39:06.877 --> 00:39:08.145
GOING FORWARD AND FIGURE OUT

00:39:08.212 --> 00:39:09.246
HOW DO WE CRACKED THAT NUT IF

00:39:09.313 --> 00:39:14.819

00:39:14.885 --> 00:39:15.586
ONE OTHER ISSUES FROM THE

00:39:15.653 --> 00:39:17.154
LOCALS WHICH IS YOU KNOW

00:39:17.221 --> 00:39:18.889
BECAUSE THIS IS ADDITIONAL COST

00:39:18.956 --> 00:39:21.959
IN THE WAY THAT FRANCHISE FEES

00:39:22.026 --> 00:39:22.760
WORK IS THIS COULD GET COME

00:39:22.827 --> 00:39:24.862
INTO JUST THE OVERALL

00:39:24.929 --> 00:39:26.430
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS INCREASES

00:39:26.497 --> 00:39:27.498
IN THEIR ONLY OBLIGATED TO GIVE

00:39:27.565 --> 00:39:30.167
SO MUCH. IT COULD IMPACT THE

00:39:30.234 --> 00:39:31.435
AMOUNT OF MONEY REVENUE THAT

00:39:31.502 --> 00:39:34.405
GOES BACK TO. HIS PC TAKES A

00:39:34.472 --> 00:39:36.373
CHUNK OFF THE TOP OF THAT.

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:39.110

GO BACK TO. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

00:39:46.817 --> 00:39:47.918
I DON'T I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S

00:39:47.985 --> 00:39:50.788
ANY ISSUE OF REACHING FINANCIAL
