AB TWENTY NINE SIXTY FIVE BY THE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE AND AB TWENTY NINE SIXTY SIX BY THE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE- WE ARE READY TO GET STARTED I THINK NOT HAVE A QUORUM. OKAY SO WE WILL OPERATE AS A SUB COMMITTEE UNTIL WE HAVE A QUORUM. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY RIGHT. ABOUT IT. SOMEONE OKAY YEAH LET'S SEE DO I HAVE IT- I THINK TRIED AGAIN I GUESS MY VOICE IF YOU HAVE NOTICED- OH SORRY MADAM CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES FIRST AND FOREMOST I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL THE WORK ON THIS BILL I WILL NEXT BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AB TWENTY EIGHT SEVENTY EIGHT WILL ADDRESS THE NEED TO REMOVE FOREST BIOMASS WASTE TO REDUCE WILDFIRES AND CREATE HEALTHIER FOREST BY PRIORITIZING STATE AGENCY USE OF AND FOCUS ON THE PROCESSING OF BIOMASS WASTE INTO BIO ENERGY AND OTHER WOOD PRODUCTS. MEMBERS I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR. THAT THIS IS THROUGH THE PROCESS OF GASIFICATION NOT COMBUSTIBLE OF COMBUSTION OF BIOMASS. BIOMASS GASIFICATION IS A MATURE TECHNOLOGY PATH- THAT USES THE CONTROL PROCESS INVOLVING HEAT STEAM AND OXYGEN TO CONVERT BIOMASS TO HYDROGEN AND OTHER PRODUCTS WITHOUT COMBUSTION. IN NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY THE BOARD OF FORESTRY ADOPTED THE OF FOREST BIOMASS UTILIZATION PLAN ACCORDING TO THIS PLAN FOR SPENDING IN CALIFORNIA WILL GENERATE TEN TO FIFTEEN MILLION TONS OF FOREST BIOMASS WASTE IN ANNUALLY. BUT THAT WASTE IS DISPOSED OF THROUGH PILE AND BURN IT WILL EMIT ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF CLIMATE NEVER PRODUCE POLLUTION. IT IS LEFT TO DECAY IT WILL THE MILK MET EMIT METHANE IT CLIMATE SUPER POLLUTANT AND CONTINUE TO POSE A FIRE THROUGHOUT. IT ALONE IN A TWENTY TWENTY ALONE CALIFORNIA'S WILDFIRES BURNED OVER FORTY MILLION ACRES AND RELEASED OVER NINETY MILLION METRIC TONS OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WITH AN ADDITIONAL TWO POINT FIVE MILLION ACRES BURNED LAST YEAR. EMISSIONS FROM THESE WILDFIRES UNDERCUT MUCH OF THE STATE'S PROGRESS IN REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND RESULT IN WIDESPREAD HAZARDOUS AIR QUALITY FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME. THE CALIFORNIA FOREST CARBON PLAN ADOPTED BY CAL EPA AND THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY FOUND THAT CONVERTING THAT FORCE WASTE AND ENERGY CAN CUT CLIMATE AND AIR POLLUTION BY HOWEVER NOT ONLY WILL THIS BILL HELP REDUCE FUTURE EMISSIONS RELATED TO THE OPEN BURNING OR NOT SHOULD BE COMPOSED TO BECOME POSITIONS USING A FOREST RESIDUALS. BUT IT WILL ALSO INCREASE ENERGY RELIABILITY AND RESILIENCY IN THOSE COMMUNITIES AT GREATEST RISK OF LOSING POWER AND CREATE JOBS AND IMPROVE THE ECONOMY AND MANY OF CALIFORNIA'S RURAL COMMUNITIES. WITH ME TO TESTIFY TODAY ARE THE CO SPONSORS CRISTINA CHRISTIANITY EARLY TEN ON BEHALF OF THE PLASTER COUNTY BY THEIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT AND JOHN KENNEDY ON BEHALF OF THE RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU BEFORE WE CONTINUE I WANT TO GO AHEAD AND TAKE ROLE SINCE WE HAVE A QUORUM HERE LARA HERE FOR. HERE FOR HERE. GARCIA MATHIS MCCARTY MURATSUCHI. SEYARTO HERE SAY ARE TO HERE STONE STONE HERE WOULD YOU CLICK HERE WE HAVE A POINT OKAY WE HAVE A QUORUM- SO WE HAVE TO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH MYSTARA INTENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY NAME IS CRISTIAN A DARLINGTON AND I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE PLASTER AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT OUR DISTRICT IS SPONSORING ITS FIRST BILL IN THE HISTORY OF THE AIR DISTRICT WITH THIS IS JUST WITH THE SPILL WE FIND THIS TO A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR OVER FIFTEEN YEARS TO BRING ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT FOREST BIOMASS WASTE CONTRIBUTES A LOT TOWARDS OUR AIR POLLUTION. IT DOES WHEN IT DECAYS IT EMITS METHANE WHEN IT'S LEFT ON THE FLOOR AND BUT MOST OFTEN IT'S DISPOSED OF THREE PILUM BURNING WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANT COULD CONTRIBUTION TO AIR POLLUTION ESPECIALLY PM TWO FIVE WHICH HAS A VERY SERIOUS HEALTH EFFECTS THERE'S A RECENT STUDY THAT HAS COME OUT FROM UC SAN DIEGO JUST LAST YEAR THAT SHOWING THAT PM TWO POINT FIVE FROM WILDFIRES IS ACTUALLY MUCH WORSE FOR OUR HEALTH THAN OTHER TYPES OF PM SO WE NEED TO PAY EXTRA SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE PM THAT'S COMING OUT FROM WILDFIRES ADDITIONALLY THE BLACK CARBON THAT'S EMITTED FROM WILDFIRES IS A CARBON FORCING AGENT WHICH IS HUNDREDS OF TIMES MORE POTENT. THAN CO TWO ALONE SO FOR BOTH OF THOSE REASONS AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICTS TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY THE BIOMASS ISSUES THAT WE HAVE THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT- FROM THE AUTHOR. ADDITIONALLY WE WOULD LIKE TO PUT OUT THAT THIS BILL WILL HELP THIS. GET WITH PLANS THEY ALREADY HAVE AND THEY'VE ALREADY INVESTED A LOT OF MAN HOURS AND TIME AND FINANCE INTO THESE PLANS. BUT THEY NEED HELP TO GET ORGANIZED AND PUT THESE PLANS INTO ACTION. THIS SPECIFICALLY IS CREATING A NEW PROGRAM AT THE JOINT WOULD INSTITUTE FOR WOOD PRODUCTS AT THE BOARD OF FORESTRY. AS WELL AS IMPLEMENTING BLACK CARBON RESEARCH INTO THE FOREST CARBON PLAN. AND THEN INCORPORATING THAT INTO THE SCOPING PLAN. AND THEN ADDITIONALLY LOOKING AT ADDITIONAL RESEARCH ON BLACK CARBON IN THE WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLAN THAT YOU. REQUIRE THEM DEBT CARD TO PUT TOGETHER A THREE SB NINE A ONE. SO WHAT THIS REALLY IS A COLLABORATION OF EFFORTS TO GET THE STATE ORGANIZED. AND WILL HOPE THAT YOU'LL CONSIDER VOTING FOR THE BILL. THANKS VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER KENNEDY ALL RIGHT JOHN KENNEDY WITH THE RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA. WE ARE VERY PLEASED TO CO SPONSOR THIS BILL HERE TODAY WITH PLASTER COUNTY- POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT. WE REPRESENT THIRTY NINE WORLD CALIFORNIA COUNTIES MOST OF WHOM HAVE BEEN HIT REALLY HARD BY WILDFIRES OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. BUT MANY OF WHOM ALSO HAVE EXPERIENCED A REAL DOWNTURN IN ENERGY RELIABILITY- UP WERE STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE OF AB TWENTY EIGHT SEVENTY EIGHT TODAY BECAUSE IT TAKES A REAL MULTI PRONGED APPROACH. TO FIND PRODUCTIVE USES FOR RESIDUAL FORCE WASTE THAT'S OUT THERE AND WILL DECOMPOSE NATURALLY IT WILL BE BURNED. THIS DOES IT THROUGH BOTH ENERGY PRODUCTION AND WOOD PRODUCTS MANUFACTURING. AB TWENTY EIGHT SEVENTY EIGHT FACILITATES WILDFIRE RISK REDUCTION IN FORCE HEALTH IMPROVEMENT IMPROVES LOCAL ENERGY RELIABILITY ENHANCES WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. AND HELPS PROTECT FAMILIES WHO WERE LIVING IN THE WHAT WE- SO WITH RESPECT TO WILDFIRE RISK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SUMMED IT UP PRETTY WELL. ESPECIALLY THE SHEER NUMBER OF ACRES BURNED AND THE- GHG EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH FIRES OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. REMOVING THESE RESIDUAL FUELS FROM THE FORCED WILL HELP REDUCE EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH MANAGEMENT OF THOSE MATERIALS. IMPORTANTLY TWENTY EIGHT SEVENTY EIGHT ALSO HELPS TO ALIGN THE STATE'S AB THIRTY TWO SCOPING PLAN. WITH THE STATE'S FOREST CARBON PLAN BOTH OF THOSE SEEM TO BE MOVING FORWARD ON PARALLELS. IS TODAY BUT WITHOUT THE LEVEL OF COORDINATION IS REQUIRED TO GET US TO WHERE WE NEED TO GET IN THE FUTURE. TWENTY EIGHT SEVENTY IT ALSO PROMOTES LOCAL ENERGY RELIABILITY FOSTERING THE USE OF BIO ENERGY TO POWER WORLD MICRO GRIDS AND FORCED IT COMMUNITIES. HELPING BIOENERGY PROJECTS INTERCONNECT WITH THE GRIT AND EXTENDING TE STATE'S BIOMET PROGRAM TO TWENTY THIRTY. THESE CAN HELP SOME OF THE MOST- AT RISK COMMUNITIES OF ELECTRICAL OUTAGES OFFSET THE NEED TO RUN MORE ONE OR MORE DIESEL GENERATORS DURING THE OUTAGES THAT SEEM TO BE OCCURRING MORE AND MORE OFTEN. AND THEN FINALLY AB TWENTY EIGHT SEVENTY WILL HELP THE STATE ACHIEVE THESE GOALS BY DEVELOPING A WORKFORCE. TRAINING PROGRAM TO ENSURE THAT OUR WORK FORCE CAN MEET THE CURRENT AND FUTURE NEEDS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY. REQUEST YOUR AYE BUT TODAY. THANK YOU- WE DON'T ANY WITNESS REGISTER IN OPPOSITION SO WE'LL MOVE ALONG TO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. OR OPPOSITION STARTING WITH THOSE IN THE HEARING ROOM.

EFFICIENT WAY TO PRODUCE ENERGY AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS BUT THIS IS A DIFFERENT THIS IS A DIFFERENT APPROACH AND I THINK AND I THINK IT'S WELL WELL WORTH WHAT WHAT WITH WHAT YOU'RE DOING. IS REALLY ABOUT OUR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT HAPPENS WITH THIS WASTE PRODUCT THAT'S IN THE FORCE THERE- SO THAT WE HAVE TO DECIDE DO WE WANT A BIG MASSIVE FIRE ORDER WEEK CAN WE LOOK AT WAYS TO MINIMIZE THAT BY HOW WE DEAL WITH THIS- WITH THIS WASTE THESE WASTE PRODUCTS AND THREW SOMETHING THAT PROVIDES A AT A BENEFIT ON THE ON THE OTHER END. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EVER PROBABLY BE FINANCIALLY THE BEST WAY TO PRODUCE ENERGY BUT BUT IT IS I THINK IT'S MORE OF A SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT US FROM THE POLLUTION WE KNOW THAT HAPPENS WE HAVE THESE MASSIVE WILDFIRES SO I WOULD HAVE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR OF IF THE BILL PASSED OUT OF COMMITTEE AND I THANK YOU VERY MUCH BRING IT FORTH.

AND THE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THE AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL. AB TWO FOUR FOUR FIVE AUTHORED CO AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER GRAYSON- WOULD ALLOW A JUDGE TO REQUIRE BONDS FOR PARTIES FILING SEQUEL LAWSUITS. AGAINST AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS- THIS BOMB WILL COVER THE COSTS AND DAMAGES INCURRED BY THE RESPONDENT BECAUSE OF A DELAY. IN THE PROJECT. SEQUELS OFTEN ENFORCED BY AGGRIEVED PARTIES REQUESTING THAT A COURT MANDATE OR EITHER A EITHER A FULL ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. IN CASES WHERE NONE WAS INITIALLY DEEMED NECESSARY OR HEAVILY REVISIONS- WERE MADE TO AN EXISTING THE I. R. SOMETIMES IT CAN SCAN FILE THESE LAWSUITS ANONYMOUSLY. IN THEORY THE SYSTEM WAS MEANT TO PROTECT THOSE MOST AFFECTED BY THE PROPOSED PROJECTS. BUT IN PRACTICE WE'VE SEEN MANY INSTANCES WHERE SEEK WAS BEEN USED. BY NIMBYS TO STOP PROJECTS OR DELAY PROJECTS- THIS WOULD JUST REQUIRE AT LEAST TO BE SOME SKIN IN THE GAME THAT YOU THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO HAVE A BONDING REQUIREMENT- THAT ENSURES THAT. YOU KNOW IF THE IF THIS IS A FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT IF THERE IS NOTHING NO MERIT TO IT. THAT THERE IS THE BOND THEIR TO HELP. INSURE THE DAMAGES TO THE IT RESPONDED OR ARE TAKING CARE OF- SO. YOUR OPPOSE THIS AS A JUST A REASONABLE REFORM- TO OUR SEQUEL LAWS TO ENSURE THAT IS YOU KNOW THESE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS THAT WE NEED AND- AND THAT WE HAVE AND ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS AREN'T UNDULY. DELAYED OR STOPPED- BECAUSE OF A FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT AND AS I WOULD ASK FOR THE COMMITTEE SUPPORT I DO HAVE TWO WITNESSES- IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL WITH ME TODAY- FIRST IS MAUREEN. SIT DOWN AND SIT DOWN IN HIS THE CEO OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY GREATER SAN FRANCISCO AND ALSO ON THE PHONE I HAVE ANDREW SAVVY ATTORNEY WITH EVEN HOUSING. OKAY AND THANK YOU FOR THAT INTRINSIC NOT EVERYBODY GETS THAT INTRO MUSIC. BUT WILL START. I'LL TAKE THAT AS A SIGN YES IT'S OKAY SO ALL THAT WILL START MS SEDONA THANK YOU PLEASE GO AHEAD A RIVAS AND- COMMITTEE MEMBERS GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MAUREEN SIT DOWN AND I'M THE CEO OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY GREATER SAN FRANCISCO IN THE FOR CHAIR OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION MADE UP OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS OUR GREAT STATE. I'M HERE TODAY TO WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT AB TWO FOUR FIVE AND THE COURAGEOUS EFFORTS OF ASSEMBLY MEMBERS GALLAGHER GRAYSON TO LESSEN THE SEVERE IMPACT CIVIL LAWSUITS HAVE ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING HABITAT GREATER SAN FRANCISCO WAS BUILT A TWENTY HOME 1100% AFFORDABLE DEVELOPMENT AND REDWOOD CITY BUT IS NOW NEARLY COMPLETE TWENTY VERY EXCITED FAMILIES ALL FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS WHO ALL DID THEIR FIVE HUNDRED HOURS OF SWEAT EQUITY. ARE IN THE PROCESS OF PURCHASING AND WILL SOON MOVE IN AND BEGIN THEIR HOMEOWNERSHIP JOURNEY IN THEIR HABITAT HOMES BUT THE HARSH REALITY IS THEY SHOULD HAVE ALREADY MOVED IN YEARS AGO FOR NEARLY SIXTEEN MONTHS THE DEVELOPMENT WAS NEEDLESSLY STALLED AFTER APPROVAL WELL WE FOUGHT A COMPLETELY BASELESS SEQUEL LAWSUIT BROUGHT FORTH BY A NEIGHBOR WHO HAD HIS BUSINESS NEXT DOOR THAT IRONICALLY USED TO BE HOUSING. WELL WE DIDN'T LIVE HE DIDN'T LIVE IN REDWOOD CITY HE WAS ADMITTEDLY ANGRY AT THE CITY FOR ALL OF THE DEVELOPMENT IN THE DOWNTOWN DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT WAS COMPLETELY IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE CITY SPECIFIC PLAN AND ALL OF THE LOCAL BUSINESS BUILDING GUIDELINES THIS LOCAL BUSINESS HAD A TRACK RECORD OF INITIATING SICKLE EDUCATION AND DOING ANYTHING THEY COULD TO STOP PROJECTS IN THE CITY. THIS HAPPENED EVEN THOUGH THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THE PROJECT HAD ALREADY BEEN METICULOUSLY REVIEWED AND UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED BY BOTH THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND THE CITY COUNCIL IN ADDITION TO THE YEARS OF DELAY THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT COST REPORTS OVER A MILLION DOLLARS THE STOCK WAS IMPACTING OUR NONPROFIT'S MISSION AND WITH NO RECOURSE NOR ANY FINANCIAL RECOVERY FOR US WHEN THE BASIL SPENCE WAS PROVEN AND THIS MADE BY THIS MEAN SPIRITED AND FALSE CLAIM. THIS CASE WAS FILED AFTER WE HAD ALREADY READ WORK TO REDUCE OUR HOME COUNT FROM THIRTY SIX TO TWENTY OWNS THE UNITS TO APPEASE THE SAME NEIGHBORS WHO ARE FIGHTING US AT STEP OF THE WAY BEING AS BELOW AS HABITAT. IS CARRYING OUT OUR UNIQUE MY OF A HIGH PERCENT AFFORDABLE. PROJECTS WE'RE- FORTUNATE RECEIVE GENEROUS PRO BOWL LEGAL SUPPORT. A COUPLE THIS WITH OUR STRONG PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CITY AND AN UNDERSTANDING AND SUPPORT OF DONOR COMMUNITY. THAT HAS ALLOWED US TO SETTLE THE CASE BEFORE ANY LITIGATION AND MOVE FOR WITH OUR PROJECT. HABITAT KNOWS HOW IMPORTANT SECRET IS TO MAINTAIN A PROTECT OUR STATE'S BEAUTIFUL NATURAL BEAUTY. BUT OUR EXPERIENCE ANY EXPERIENCE OF HUNDREDS OF OTHERS DEMONSTRATES HOW THE UNFAIR AND MISUSE APPLICATION OF SEQUEL. ON THE GROUND HAS A PARTIAL OFTEN EXPENSIVE EFFECT ON THE ABILITY OF ALL DEVELOPERS. THERE MUST BE A BETTER WAY UNFORTUNATELY DEVELOP PERSONAL DEVELOPMENTS LIKE OURS AND OTHERS GET DERAILED OR CANCELED ALTOGETHER. AT A TIME WE ARE MILLIONS OF UNITS SHORTEN OUR STATE. OF MEETING THE DEMAND FOR ALL HOUSING AND DESPERATE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. MISGUIDED LITIGATION HAS A HIDDEN IMPACT ON MORE ECONOMICALLY MARGINAL PROJECTS THAT THAT DID NOT GET OFF THE GROUND AT ALL. BECAUSE THESE DEVELOPERS KNOW THE COULD NOT FINANCIALLY SURVIVE EVEN A FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT. GIVEN JUDICIAL OFFICERS THE AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE A SINGLE PETITIONER TO POST A BOND. COULD LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD AND HELP ENSURE ONLY SERIOUS THREATS O OUR ENVIRONMENT- BROUGHT FORWARD. AND LIKELY WOULD DETERRENT DISCOURAGE THESE MOST PRIVILEGED SEQUEL LAWSUITS OFTEN SALLY BROUGHT BY THOSE. LOOKING FOR A PAYOUT. FROM SEEING THE LIGHT OF DAY. THIS WOULD GIVE AFFORDABLE HOME BUILDERS CONFIDENCE. FROM THIS WORST EFFECTS OF THIS ABUSE ONE WE'RE HERE TO FULFILL OUR MISSION BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HELP SOLVE OUR STATE'S UNPRECEDENTED HOUSING CRISIS. HAVE A DECORATOR SAN FRANCISCO AND HABITAT CALIFORNIA ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE LEADERSHIP OF ASSEMBLY MEMBERS GRAYSON GALLAGHER. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK THIS COMMITTEE TO JOIN THEM AND SUPPORT AB TWO FOUR FIVE. THANK YOU. NEXT WE HAVE- ANDREW AB TESTIFYING OVER THE PHONE. OPERATOR CAN YOU HEAR ME YES. GREAT THANK YOU THAT THAT INTRODUCED AB I'M A PARTNER IN THE LAW FIRM OF PODCASTONE NICHOLSON- AND I TYPICALLY REPRESENT PROJECT APPLICANTS INCLUDING- APPLICANTS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO DEFEAT IN HOUSING AND WE'VE HAD A RECENT EXPERIENCE WITH THEM- BEING THAT OF A PRIVILEGE LAWSUIT THAT IF THERE WERE THERAPY TO PROCEED WITH A 100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING. PROJECT IN THE CITY OF LIVERMORE AND LET THEIR FINANCING WINDOW WHICH- IT'S HARD TO CALCULATE THE DAMAGES BUT THEY HAD A SIXTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR TAX CREDIT ALLOCATION THAT THEY'VE HAD TO TURN BACK IN SOLELY AS THE RESULT OF A OF THE CHECK WHICH TO THAT IS HAS BEEN DENIED BUT CAN BE APPEALED AND CONTINUE THE DELAY- AND I THINK THE KEY MESSAGES THAT THAT THE CHILLING EFFECT OF THIS KIND OF LITIGATION ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING IT'S ACTUALLY. DIFFICULT TO OVERSTATE THE CHILLING EFFECT OF THAT- AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT IN PARTICULAR ARE TYPICALLY AND YOU KNOW HABITAT IS ONLY ONE UNIQUE MODEL BUT THEY TYPICALLY. RELY ON A VERY COMPLICATED HEAVILY REGULATED AND UNFORGIVING BANK FINANCING. MECHANISMS THAT. IT JUST CANNOT CALL THE THAT THE ASSOCIATE WITH MEDICAID AND OPPONENTS WHICH BEGS MAY BE UPON TO ARE PRETTY SOPHISTICATED UNDER AND THEY ALSO UNDERSTAND THE BIG BASS NO WAY NO FINANCIAL. CONCERNS ALL IN BRINGING THE AND BIG BOMB MAKER A MODEST BUT I THINK MEANINGFUL STEP- AS AND I WERE DISCLOSE WHAT OTHER TIPS LEVELING THE PLAYING. AND ENSURING THE THOSE WHO THE SO OF LOS CAPITAL IN THE TO SEE IT'S NOT TOO THE AFFORD TO THE AND LET'S FACE IT THE FOLKS WOULD REALLY BENEFIT FROM THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHO WHO STAND TO LOSE AND IT WOULD EMPOWER THE COURTS. TO OVERSEE THESE ISSUES THAT AND- IMPOSED SUBJECTS SO I SAY COMMEND YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I'M NOT WE HAVE ONE WITH- IN OP. A MISTER GERMANY'S FOR THE STATE BUILDING AND CAN TRADE COUNCIL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IT'S NICE TO BE BACK IN FRONT OF ALL OF YOU IN PERSON- GOOD TO SEE EVERYBODY ALL THE WAY AROUND- I'M JEREMY SMITH HERE ON BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL- AND OPPOSITION TO THIS LEGISLATION- YOU KNOW I JUST TALKED TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER A FEW MINUTES AGO. I KNOW THIS IS THE FIRST COMMITTEE- BUT WE DID NOTE SOME OF SERIOUS ISSUES WITH THE BILL AS WE READ IT AS OUR TEAM AT AT AT THE AT THE BUILDING TRDES- FIRST OF ALL- THERE THE RECENT AMENDMENTS DO NOT FIX THE PROBLEMS THAT WE IDENTIFIED IN OUR LETTER-% BECAUSE THE BILL STILL ALLOWS A COURT. TO REQUIRE PLAINTIFFS TO POST A BOND TO COVER COSTS AND DAMAGES TO AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT WHICH AN AGENCY OR DEVELOPER CLAIM THEY WANT KERR AS A RESULT OF THE LAWSUIT. WITHOUT SUPPORTING EVIDENCE. THAT THE BILL WOULD ALSO CREATE AN UNPRECEDENTED CHANGE A LAW TO ALLOW THE TRIAL COURT TO REQUIRE A SEQUEL PETITIONER TO POST A BOND ON ITS OWN MOTION. WITHOUT BEING ASKED FOR ONE BY ANY OF THE PARTIES IN THE CASE- WE WILL REVIEW THIS IS A VIOLATION OF THE PETITIONERS DUE PROCESS RIGHTS BY ALLOWING THE COURT TO VOLUNTARILY TAKE SIDES WITH THE DEVELOPER MYSTICAL CASE BEFORE TRIAL. BEFORE REVIEWING THE EVIDENCE FOR THE MERITS OF THE CASE. IT WOULD ALSO BE A MAJOR VIOLATION OF THE COURT'S DUTY TO IMPARTIALITY IN OF THE COURTS TO TEACH OF STAIN FROM RULING ON SUBSTANTIVE MATTERS THAT THE PARTIES HAVE NOT PLACED BEFORE IT. FOR WE JUST BELIEVE THE BILL IS UNNECESSARY BECAUSE EXISTING LOT. CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE FIVE TO NINE POINT TWO- ALREADY ALLOWS DEFENDANTS TO ASK THE COURT TO REQUIRE A BOND IF THE COURT FINDS OF THE SEQUEL LAWSUIT HAS THE EFFECT OF PREVENTING. OR DELAYING AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT AND I. WANTED TO CONCLUDE WITH- REFERENCE BACK TO A TWENTY TWENTY ONE STUDY BY THE ROSE FOUNDATION. THERE'S FOUND THE NUMBER OF LAWSUITS FILED UNDER SPEAK WITH ABOUT CALIFORNIA. HAS BEEN LOW AVERAGING. ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE PER YEAR SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWO. THIS REPLICATION FOR CHALLENGES TO PROJECTS ALLEGING NON COMPLIANCE TO SEEK IT WAS ALSO VERY LOW WITH LAWSUITS FILED. FOR TWO OUT OF EVERY ONE HUNDRED PROJECTS. WE DON'T THINK THERE'S A THERE THERE- I THINK EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM. HAS A WORST CASE SCENARIO LAWSUIT EXAMPLE. MANY OF YOU BUT I'M ADDRESSING RIGHT NOW PROBABLY HAVE MORE THAN ONE. YOU PROBABLY HEAR FROM YOUR CONSTITUENTS ALL THE TIME. BUT FOR ALL THE LAWSUITS FILED IN CALIFORNIA SYKORA. IS LOW SEE WHAT TEACHER LOW IN THAT SENSE. SO WE'RE JUST NOT SURE THIS BILL IS NECESSARY AND WE ARE CONCERNED WITH THE CHANGE. TO PROCESS IN THIS DELIGHT IT- PLACES UPON PLAINTIFFS. WHO MANY OF WHOM- WE THINK- HAVE VERY VALID REASONS TO FILE LAWSUITS SO FOR THOSE REASONS WERE OPPOSED TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU HAVE NEXT WILL MOVE TO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION WILL START IN THE HEARING ROOM. MADAM CHAIR HOLLY FOR MANY DAYS USED WITH WHITE HOUSE PUBLIC AFFAIRS HERE IN SUPPORTING OF THE OFFICE BURDENS AND HELP PROPERTIES. THANK YOU CHEN MEMBERS THE HONESTY TODAY WITH BROWN STEEN ON BEHALF OF HOUSING ACTION COALITION SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OPERATOR KEY PLEASE OPEN UP THE LINES FOR ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION OF AB TWO FOUR FOUR FIVE. FOUR COMMENTS IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION AT EIGHT B. TWO FOUR FOUR FIVE PLEASE PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. THAT COMMAND AGAIN ONE ZERO. AND WE WILL START WITH LINE TWENTY TWO PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MICHAEL GUNNING HERE WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. AND NEXT WE'LL GO TO LINE TWENTY FIVE. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS APERAM REPRESENTING THE SEVEN CALIFORNIA RENTAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. AN ALLIANCE TWENTY THREE. SH JOSH AMERICANS THAT THE RESIDENTS FOR RESPONSIBLE GROWTH AND STRONG SUPPORT. SENATE MADAM CHAIR THERE ARE NO FURTHER COMMENT AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU- ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. K. C. NINE- WE HAVE A MOTION OF MISTER VERSACE. THANK YOU UP MR GALLAGHER. SO I THINK ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT I'M HEARING IS THAT THE BOND REQUIREMENT MIGHT- BE HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT ON THE BRINGING OF THE JUDGMENT SEQUEL LAWSUITS COULD YOU CAN YOU RESPOND TO THAT- WELL I THINK WHAT THE WITNESS IS SAYING IS THAT SEEK WAS HAVING A CHILLING EFFECT ON. AFFORDABLE HOUSING- BECAUSE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS YOU KNOW IF THEY'RE GETTING CHALLENGE THEN. AND IT'S GOING TO BE THAT COSTLY TO GO THROUGH ALL THAT PROCESS THEN. PEOPLE AND PEOPLE RISK LOSING THEIR TAX CREDIT YOU KNOW LIKE SO THE INSTANCE OF THE EXAMPLE CITED IT WAS LIKE A SIXTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR TAX CREDIT ASSOCIATED WITH THAT PROJECT. THEY'VE NOW HAD TO GIVE THAT BACK NO I WRITE AND- I HEARD THAT FROM YOUR WITNESS BUT- FROM THE OPPOSITION I THOUGHT I HEARD- READ IN THEIR OPPOSITION LETTER THAT. MY ROLE MY RESPOND LOOK I WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION- YOU KNOW AS HE SAID WE JUST SPOKE- YOU KNOW AND IF THE COMMITTEE DOES PASS IT OUT TODAY WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH YOU KNOW THOSE ISSUES. I DON'T I DON'T FOR SEE A CHILLING EFFECT BECAUSE AGAIN THIS ISN'T STOPPING. MERITORIOUS LAWSUITS IF THERE'S A LEGITIMATE- SEQUEL LAWSUIT BROUGHT ON. OUR MENTAL IMPACTS BECAUSE THE PROJECT WHICH IS ASSOCIATED WITH LABOR. WORK FORCE. YOU CAN STILL BRING THOSE FORD AND THERE MAY NOT EVEN BE A THE RIVER. IN THOSE CASES GO AGAIN THIS MAY. DOESN'T SAY SHE- SO. BUT IT IS TRYING TO GET OUT WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN IN. REALLY EVERY COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS PEOPLE TRYING TO BRING FORWARD GOOD AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS AND SORT OF A NIMBY LAWSUIT IS BROUGHT THAT DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF. YOU KNOW MERIT TWO AWARDS AT LEAST THE COURT HAS THE ABILITY TO. ISSUE A BONDING REQUIREMENT TO SAY LOOK IF YOU'RE NOT SUCCESSFUL AND IT'S FOUND THAT THIS IS. NOT A MERITORIOUS CLAIM THAT THERE'S SOMETHING TO COVER THE LOSSES TO. THE RESPONDENT. YOU KNOW AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND AGAIN IT IS LIMITED TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS. AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS SO BASED ON THAT I MEAN IS THERE SOME TRUTH TO WHAT. MISTER SMITH OF THE BUILDING TRADES AS SAYING THAT. THE JUDGE IS BEING ASKED TO KIND OF LIKE PRE JUDGE. THE FACTS OF THE CASE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT- ON HIS HER OWN MOTION. WHETHER A BOND IS. IS JUSTIFIED WELL IT'S NOT REALLY PRE JUDGING IT I MEAN WE SEEN THIS AND OTHER CASES LIKE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTIONS FOR EXAMPLE OR- WHERE THERE IS. REQUIREMENTS IF YOU'RE GONNA GET THIS THAT YOU HAVE TO PUT UP A BOND. RIGHT IT'S NOT. AND IT'S YOU KNOW USUALLY A BOND IS NOT LIKE THE FULL AMOUNT RIGHT IT'S YOU'RE PAYING A PORTION AND THE BOND IS PLACE FOR THE COURT- IT JUST PUTS THAT UP THERE IS A HEY LOOK IF IN FACT- YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT A MERITORIOUS CLAIM THERE'S SOMETHING TO. ACCOUNT FOR THAT AND I WILL LOOK IT DOES REQUIRE AT LEAST YOU TO HAVE SOME. SOME SKIN IN THE GAME- YOU KNOW HAVE A REALLY STRONG BELIEF IN THAT YOUR CASE IS A OF YOU KNOW LEGITIMATE ONE BEFORE YOU'RE BRINGING IT. AGAINST AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT. THANK YOU. MR STONE. THIS THANK YOU WANNA MAKE A COMMENT TO THE COMMITTEE THAT THIS IS ESSENTIALLY A RESTATEMENT OF EXISTING LAW WHICH I DON'T FIND OFFENSIVE THE THERE IS A BIT OF AN ADDITION THAT DOES ALLOW THE COURT ON ITS OWN MOTION WHICH I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND HERE BUT THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT. I THINK WILL BE ADDRESSED IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE. THANK YOU MR MCCARTY. YEAH THANK YOU I'M I'M ON. YOU KNOW SOMEONE STRUGGLING WITH THIS BECAUSE I'VE SEEN THAT ABUSE HERE OUT OF MY OWN CITY HERE FOR JUST A FEW MILES FROM HERE NOT AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT BUT YOU KNOW VERY VERY. WEALTHY INDIVIDUAL WITH PLENTY OF TIME AND PLENTY OF MONEY ON THEIR HANDS IT JUST TO SEE CRAP ALL THE TIME ON HOUSING PROJECTS THAT INEVITABLY- PAST SEVEN OR BUILT IN JUST DELAYED AND COST MONEY AND CREATED PROBLEMS. AND I HEAR THE OPPOSITION FROM OUR BUILDING TRADES AS WELL BUT HOW WOULD YOU RSPOND MR GALLAGHER TO YOU KNOW WHAT MR MARTUCCI NOT MENTIONED WHAT IT YOU KNOW THIS INDIVIDUAL HERE IS A WELL HEELED YOU KNOW HAS A MULTI YOU KNOW HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR TRUST AND CAN JUST THIS IS JUST FINE FOR THEM. BUT WHAT IF THERE'S A LEGITIMATE NEIGHBORHOOD GROUP THAT DOESN'T HAVE RESOURCES IS TALKING ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUES AND AIR QUALITY AND SO FORTH THEY DON'T HAVE THE WHERE WITH ALL POTENTIALLY A LARGE ORGANIZATION. MISTER SMITH REPRESENTS OR YOU KNOW THIS MASSIVE TRUST YOUR ANY SACRAMENTO THAT KELLY TRUST THAT GOES OUT ALL THE TIME HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND TO THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE IN. THE- ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS VIA SEQUEL. WELL I GUESS WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT IF THERE'S A CASE LIKE THAT WHERE YOU KNOW THEIR ADDRESS SEEN LEGITIMATE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS FROM THE CASE I THINK IT'S PROBABLY UNLIKELY THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A BOND REQUIREMENT BECAUSE AGAIN THIS IS MAY IT'S NOT SHALL REQUIRE A BONDING REQUIREMENT FOR EVERY CHALLENGE. TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING- PROJECT- I THINK IT IS TRYING TO GET OUT THAT LIMITED AND AGAIN SOMEONE YOU HAVE TO PETITION OR THE COURT WOULD HAVE TO DO IT ON ITS OWN MOTION- ON THE PART ABOUT THE COURT DOING TIME MOTION IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING I'M WILLING TO TALK ABOUT AND WHEN WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT- IF I MOVE ON TO MISTER STONES COMMITTEE- AND SO- YOU CAN DEFINITELY LOOK AT THAT ISSUE- BUT- I DON'T SEE IT AS BEING AN IMPEDIMENT LIKE IF YOU HAVE A LEGITIMATE. SEQUEL LAWSUIT YOU CAN STILL BRING IT. AND YOU KNOW THERE MAY BE A BONDING REQUIREMENT REQUIRED- AGAIN THAT'S NOT USUALLY LIKE PUTTING UP THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE LAWSUIT IT'S A- NO PORTION PERCENTAGE THERE OF SO I DON'T SEE IT IS STOPPING ANY KIND OF LEGITIMATE. SEQUEL LAWSUIT WHAT IT WILL TRY AND DO IS DETER. THE ONES THAT YOU KNOW AS YOU'VE NOTICED IN YOUR OWN COMMUNITY THAT ARE- YEP NOT MERITORIOUS ARE REALLY JUST BEING BOUGHT BROUGHT FOR THE PURPOSES OF DELAY. I HEY MISTER SEYARTO SO KIND OF IN RESPONSE TO A LITTLE BIT WHAT I'VE BEEN HEARING- BUT YEAH I'VE SEEN SEVERAL OF THESE WHERE IT'S THE COMMUNITIES AND AFTER ARE BECAUSE THERE IS A- AND THE DEVELOPMENT THEY DON'T LIKE GOING INTO WHETHER IT'S AFFORDABLE HOW HOMES ARE HIGH DENSITY HOMES OR WHATEVER AND THEY NEVER SEEM TO BE- AT A LOSS TO BE ABLE TO FIND AN ATTORNEY- USUALLY THE ATTORNEY FINDS THEM. AND AND SO THEY'RE NOT THE ONES THAT ARE KIND OF AT RISK OF DOING THE SUIT ESPECIALLY IF THAT ATTORNEY IS CONFIDENT- THAT THEY'RE GOING TO- PREVAIL IN A IN A IN A SUIT THAT'S THAT'S FINE BUT WHAT I'VE ALSO FOUND IS THAT THESE ATTORNEYS- SOME OF THEM- ENGAGE AND GET A SMALL. YEAH BASICALLY A PALE. AND THEN EVERYBODY YOU KNOW AND THE PEOPLE THERE WERE NOT FOR AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING. THEY JUST LA I MEAN THEY JUST DID DEVELOPMENT GOES FORWARD REGARDLESS OF THEIR CONCERNS. AND YOU KNOW YOU GET TO MORE STOP SIGNS PUT IN. AND THE ATTORNEY GETS D. V- A SETTLEMENT- FROM FROM THAT. AND SO I DON'T THINK THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ABLE TO ACCESS WILL BE UNABLE TO ACCESS BECAUSE I THINK THIS PLENTY PEOPLE REPRESENTING THEM. THAT'LL DO IT WITHOUT- WITHOUT THEM GETTING CHARGED- SO I THINK WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO HERE THE AUTHORS TRYING TO DO HERE. IS NOBLE AND TRYING TO GET ONE OF THE HURDLES OF OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING- SITUATION- KIND OF DEALT WITH. SO I THINK IT'S A GOOD BILL AND- PLAN AND SPORTING THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS CASEY NINE I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION I KNOW YOU JUST- HEARD THEIR CONCERNS RECENTLY- BUT I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK THROUGH IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE- INCLUDING WITH THE CHAIR OF THE NEXT COMMITTEE- LIKE HIS COMMENTS TODAY SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING TODAY OF WE HAVE A MOTION BY MISTER MATHIS AND A SECOND. BY MISTER C. R. TO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE- YES MA'AM CHAIR AND THANK YOU AGAIN- AND CERTAINLY I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION- MISTER DONUT JUST SETS AND I THINK WAS REALLY GOOD I JUST WANTED TO AND WITH THIS IS THERE'S ALSO STATUS QUO RIGHT NOW IS COSTING NONPROFITS YOU KNOW LIKE HABITAT FOR HUMANITY BECAUSE- YOU KNOW THEY CONTINUE TO LOSE MONEY HAVING TO FEND THESE LAWSUITS THE DELAY BECAUSE FROM THE- THESE MUCH NEEDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS THEY'RE LOSING MONEY EVERY DAY. THIS JUST HELPS KIND OF AT LEAST BRING SOME BALANCE TO THAT SITUATION TO HELP- WHERE THERE ARE WHERE THERE ARE- YOU KNOW FRIVOLOUS CASES BEING BROUGHT TO STOP THESE PROJECTS SO I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND- THANK YOU MEMBERS.

INTO HYDROGEN AND ELECTRIC ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES MAJOR AUTOMAKERS INCLUDING FORD AND GENERAL MOTORS HAVE UNVEILED ZERO EMISSION CRATE MOTORS THEY CAN BE USED TO REPLACE THE ENGINE IN A GAS POWERED VEHICLE. ONE MANUFACTURER OFFERS A COMPLETE RETROFIT KIT FOR A CLASSIC VOLKSWAGEN BEETLE AT JUST UDER EIGHTEEN THOUSAND THAT'S TEN THOUSAND CHEAPER THAN SOME OF THE MOST INEXPENSIVE ELECTRIC CARS ON THE MARKET SO TO MEET CALIFORNIA'S CONSUMERS DEMAND. FOR MOREAFFORDABLE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS THE STATE NEEDS NEW AND CREATIVE WAYS TO MAKE ZAB OWNERSHIP MORE ACCESSIBLE AND AFFORDABLE. BY CREATING A CONSUMER REBATE PROGRAM BY CONVERTING USE GASOLINE POWER CARS INTO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE. AB TWENTY THREE FIFTY WILL HELP THE STATE MEET ITS AMBITIOUS CLIMATE GOALS.

THE BILL AS A VOTES WILL LEAVE IT OPEN FOR OTHER MEMBERS THANK YOU THANK YOU. MYSTERY THIS. PRESENT IN AB TWENTY SIX THIRTEEN. THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR COLLEAGUES GREAT TO SEE EVERYBODY THIS AFTERNOON AND AT THAT BEFORE I BEGIN I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE WORK ON THIS LEGISLATION AND LIKE TO KNOW THAT ARE WEEKS EXCEPT IN THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS- AND THIS LEGISLATION IS ON THE BILL TO SIX ONE THREE SEEKS TO CREATE A PILOT PROGRAM WITHIN THE EXISTING FARM AND RANCH SOLID WASTE CLEANUP AND ABATEMENT GRANT PROGRAM. TO HELP FARMERS AND RANCHERS ACCESS FUNDING TO CLEAN UP ILLEGAL DUMPING ON THE PROPERTIES ILLEGAL DUMPING OF TRASH ON FARMLANDS THREATENS FOOD SAFETY- CAN CAUSE CROP LOSS AS WELL AS LOSS OF CERTIFICATION FOR ORGANIC FARMERS. AND WHILE THE EXISTING GRANT PROGRAM WAS INTENDED TO HELP FARMERS AND RANCHERS CLEAN UP ILLEGALLY DUMPED TRASH ON THE PROPERTIES OVER TIME MORE AND MORE OF THE FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM HAS GONE TO LANDS THAT ARE NOT IN ACTIVE AGRICULTURAL USE. AS A RESULT FARMERS AND RANCHERS ARE- THEY'RE GETTING LESS AND LESS FUNDING FROM A PROGRAM THAT IS CURRENTLY OVER SUBSCRIBED- EVEN THOUGH ILLEGAL DUMPING ON THEIR LANDS IS INCREASING- THIS LEGISLATION WILL HELP ENSURE THAT AS ADDITIONAL RESOURCES BECOME AVAILABLE FUNDS ARE DEDICATED TO FARMERS AND RANCHERS AS PART OF THE OF THIS NEW- THE PILOT PROGRAM I WITH MEAT HERE TO TESTIFIES OF THESE KÞT LITTLE WITH THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR BASED COMMITTEE- MY NAME IS KATIE LITTLE AND WITH THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU. FARM BUREAU IS PLEASED TO SPONSOR AB TWENTY SIX THIRTEEN TODAY WHICH WOULD CREATE A PILOT PROGRAM TO PRIORITIZE FUNDING FOR FARMERS AND RANCHERS TO CLEAN UP ILLEGALLY DUMPED WASTE ON THE PROPERTY. FARMS REPRESENTS MORE THAN THIRTY TWO THOUSAND MEMBERS STRIVES TO PROTECT AND IMPROVE THE BAY AVAILABILITY OF FOR FARMERS AND RANCHERS ENGAGED PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE. AND PROJECT SAFE RELIABLE FOOD FOR THE CONSUMERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. CURRENTLY CAL RECYCLE ADMINISTERS OF FARM AND RANCH SOLID WASTE ABATEMENT CLEANUP PROGRAM WITH THIS SIMILAR GOAL TO THE PILOT ARE PROPOSING TODAY. THIS PROGRAM IS FUNDED ANNUALLY AT ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO VARIOUS WAYS FUNDS. THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES GRANTS TO PUBLIC ENTITIES A CITY COUNTY RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICT ARE RECOGNIZED NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBE FOR CLEAN UP AND ABATEMENT OF PROJECTS. ON BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LANDS IN THE PAST MANY OF THESE AWARDS HAVE BEEN GRANTED TOWARDS PUBLIC CLEANUP. THAT WAS ZONED FOR AGRICULTURE BUT WOULD NOT AND ACTIVE AGRICULTURAL USE WITH THE RECENT INCREASE OF ILLEGAL DUMPING POSSIBLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE RECENT COVED NINETEEN PANDEMIC. THIS FUND HAS BECOME OVERSUBSCRIBED. AB TWENTY SIX THIRTEEN HOPES TO. HELP RESEARCHERS WITH THIS BY PRIORITIZING THE ACTIVE AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY CLEAN UP ON FARMING AND RANCHING OPERATIONS. SINCE THE CURRENT PROGRAM ALLOWS FOR PUBLIC ENTITIES TO ALSO APPLY FOR THE FUNDS FARMERS AND RANCHERS MUST COMPETE FOR FUNDING IN AN OVERSUBSCRIBED PROGRAM. THE CURRENT PROCESSES ULTIMATELY STRETCHED ACROSS MANY APPLICANTS IN ADDITION TO FARMERS AND RANCHERS BY PRIORITIES IN FORT FARMERS AND RANCHERS THIS PILOT GUARANTEES FUNDING WILL GO DIRECTLY TO CLEANING UP. FARMS AND RANCHERS IN ENSURING FOOD SAFETY FOR THE CONSUMER. FURTHERMORE IT WOULD SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S CLEAN UP CALIFORNIA SHIP THAT WAS RELEASED LAST YEAR. THIS IS JUST ONE OF THE MANY OBSTACLES THAT FACE FARMERS AND RANCHERS THIS YEAR ALONG WITH THE DROUGHT SUPPLY. ISSUES INFLATION AND INCREASING REGULATORY. PRESSURES FARMERS MUST ALL SO FIGHT AGAINST OF THE LEAGUE ACTIVE. THAT THREATEN THEIR LIVELIHOODS. THIS PILOT HOPES TO HELP FARMERS AND RANCHERS KEEP CALM AT LEAST ONE OF THESE OBSTACLES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEN THEM IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM REMOVED OPPOSITION THERE IS NO- STATED OPPOSITION. ANY OPPOSITION THE PHONE LINES.

THERE WAS A BILL AS A THOSE WILL LEAVE IT ON CALL FOR OTHER MEMBERS. BUT ALRIGHT MR CORK. AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY SEVEN. THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR CAN MEMBERS. BOB FIRST I WANT TO THANK COMMITTEE STAFFER FANTASTIC ANALYSIS. AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY SEVEN PHASES OUT THE USE OF ONLINE TIPS FOR PRODUCED WATER DISPOSAL. WHEN OIL IS PRODUCED IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT EIGHTEEN BARRELS OF PRODUCED WATER GENERATED WITH EVERY BARREL OF OIL. THIS PRODUCED WATER CAN SOMETIMES BE USED. IN AGRICULTURE AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES BUT MANY TIMES IT CONTAINS HIGH LEVEL OF SALTS FLUORIDE. ARSENIC AND OTHER CHEMICALS ASSOCIATED WITH THE OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION. BOB WHEN PRODUCED WATERS DISPOSED OF IT ONLINE. CHEMICALS FROM THE WASTE WATER OR RELIGION RELEASED DIRECTLY INTO THE ENVIRONMENT. VOLATILE CHEMICALS LIKE BENZENE EVAPORATE INTO THE AIR. WELL WATER SALTS AND OTHER CHEMICALS PARTICULATE INTO THE SOIL AND GROUNDWATER BELOW. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN A REPORT BY THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. A LARGE BERKELEY NATIONAL LAB RAISED ABOUT THIS PRACTICE. REPORTS AUTHORS RECOMMENDED THAT THE STATE ENSURE SAFE DISPOSAL OF PRODUCED WATER IN PARTICULAR SHOULD PET WITH APPROPRIATE TESTING AND TREATMENT OR PHASE OUT THIS PRACTICE. SINCE ITS RECOMMENDATION STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT PRODUCED WATER DISPOSAL IT ONLINE IT IS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED GROUNDWATER THE COULD BE USED FOR IRRIGATION OR OTHER BENEFICIAL USES. GROUNDWATER'S CRITICAL FOR IRRIGATION DURING DROUGHTS IN THE CONTINUED USE OF ONLINE PITCH FOR PRODUCED WATE DISPOSAL POSES A RISK TO PRECIOUS GROUNDWATER RESOURCES. CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY MAJOR OIL AND GAS PRODUCING STATE THAT STILL ALLOWS ONLINE TICKETS FOR WASTEWATER DISPOSAL. THIS BILL FOLLOWS THE LEAD OF OTHER STATES INCLUDING POLLUTING TEXAS NEW MEXICO AND NORTH DAKOTA. AND PHASES OUT ONLINE PITCH STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. WITH ME TODAY IS DR DOMINIC. D. JULIA. THAT'S DR DOMINIC TO JULIA- FROM- HEALTHY ENERGY AND HAY SEUSS ALONSO FROM CLEAN WATER ACTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ITS FIRST WITNESS IN SUPPORT PLEASE. I THINK THAT ON THE GOOD AFTERNOON AND KICKING. WHAT THE HECK. FIRST WITH US IN SUPPORT PLEASE. HI GOOD AFTERNOON CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES WE CAN HEAR YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT MY SUPPORT FOR A P. TWENTY FOUR FORTY SEVEN MY NAME'S HAS WAS ALONE SO ON THE CURRENT CAMINO ORGANIZER FOR CLEAN WATER ACTION. WASTEWATER UNLINED PITS A SCENE IN THE TWENTY FIFTEEN TO FIFTY STUDY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR AIR AND GROUND WATER QUALITY. CONTAMINATION FROM GROUND WATER THAT IS BEING USED BY A NEIGHBORING COMMUNITY IS A VIOLATION OF THEIR HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER. I THINK COMMUNITIES ARE PREDOMINANTLY LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. YOU DO NOT HAVE THE LUXURY OF JUST MOVING TO A BETTER PLACE- THEY WOULD% NEED TO STAY AND HAVE THEIR FAMILIES PERPETUALLY EXPOSED TO AN UNDISCLOSED NUMBER OF CONTAMINANTS AND TOXINS. AND IT WOULD BE IN CONSTANT RISK OF DEVELOPING CANCER AND ANY NUMBER OF CARDIOVASCULAR AND NEUROLOGICAL HEALTH ISSUES- WE KNOW THAT LIVING YOUR POLLUTION SOURCES IS HARMFUL FOR ONE'S HEALTH. AND ALLOWING A NINE PITCH CONTINUE AS THEYARE WOULD BE RISKING. BRINGING THOSE VERY SAME CONTAMINANTS DIRECTLY INTO THE HOME. THERE'S REALLY NO MORE OR LOGICAL REASON FOR WHY THE STATE SHOULD REMAIN ONLINE. THE NEED OF THE INDUSTRY TO SAVE A FEW BUCKS DOES NOT OUTWEIGH THE RISK THEY POSE TO OUR FAMILIES. ABOUT THE DEADLY SUPPORT AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY SEVEN. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS IN SUPPORT PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR VICE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBER SARAH MY NAME IS TOM JULIA. HE I AM A SENIOR RESEARCH SCIENTIST AT PC HEALTHCARE G. AND A RESEARCH AFFILIATE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO I WAS PREVIOUSLY EMPLOYED BY THE U. S. HE'D BE A FOR THIRTY ONE YEARS AS A REGULATOR. HE GOT AS A RESEARCH SCIENTIST I WAS THE LEAD AUTHOR OF A PAPER. RECENTLY PUBLISHED IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OUTLINING THE PAST. AND CURRENT PRACTICE OF DISPOSAL PRODUCED WATER INTO ONLINE PRODUCE WATER BOND IN CALIFORNIA. AND ITS IMPACT ON GROUNDWATER RESOURCES. IT IS WELL KNOWN TO NUMEROUS PUBLISHED STUDIES. AT THIS DISPOSAL PRACTICE BECAUSE THIS DROUGHT OR CONTAMINATION. FOR THIS REASON TO MY KNOWLEDGE THE EVERY STATE EXCEPT CALIFORNIA HAS BANNED THIS PRACTICE. FOR THIS PRACTICE OF TAPERED OFF IN RECENT YEARS THE VOLUME OF PRODUCED WATER DISPOSAL AN ONLINE PART IN CALIFORNIA STILL LARGE AND IS COMPATIBLE TO THE TOTAL VOLUME OF PRODUCE BORDER IN OTHER OIL AND GAS PRODUCING STATES SUCH AS PENNSYLVANIA. OUR MONITORING IS SPARSE BUT WHERE IT HAS OCCURRED IMPACT REGIONAL THE AQUIFERS AND GROUNDWATER HAVING BENEFICIAL USE. HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED. ONCE GROUND WATER IS CONTAMINATED BY SELLING WATER IT CANNOT BE CLEANED UP. IT CAN ONLY BE DISPERSED OVER TENS OR HUNDREDS AND CONTINUES TO CAUSE MAJOR NATURAL RESOURCE DAMAGE. OVER SIXTEEN BILLION BARRELS OF SELLING WATER HAVE BEEN DISPOSED PAST FORTY FIVE YEARS CREATING A MASSIVE GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION PROBLEM FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS. OUR IS NOT STAGNANT LARGE GROUNDWATER PLUMES WILL MOVE THE OVERTIME AND EVENTUALLY IMPACT AGRICULTURAL AND PUBLIC SUPPLY WELLS. FOR THESE REASONS I AT THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT BECAUSE HE GAVE ME TWENTY FOUR SEVEN. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE GOT ONE WITH US IN OPPOSITION MISTER CALDERON. COME ON UP. TWO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THAT DOWNSIDE WHEREVER YOU'RE MORE COMFORTABLE. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS PAUL THE EURO REPRESENTING THE WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION- WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB TWO FOUR FOUR SEVEN WHICH WOULD PROHIBIT THE PLACEMENT OF PRODUCED WATER AND BUYING PONDS. SIX THIS ACTIVITY IS HIGHLY REGULATED BY THE REGIONAL WATER QUALITY BOARD WHICH INCLUDES THREE LEVELS OF REGULATION THAT REFLECT THE RELATIVELY THE RELATIVE RISK TO GROUNDWATER FROM OILFIELD THAT PRODUCED WATERS. IF WHAT WAS HAPPENING. IT RELATED TO WHAT THE PROPONENTS WERE SAYING AS FAR AS GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION- AIR QUALITY ISSUES. SPONSORED BE SHUT DOWN. THESE THESE REGARD HIGHLY REGULATED- AT AT AT AT EVERY TURN- IF THE GROUND IF THERE IS GROUNDWATER THE REGIONAL WATER QUALITY BOARD DOES A ROBUST RISK ASSESSMENT AND MAKES A DETERMINATION IF A PERMIT IS WARRANTED. MONITORING IS CONDUCTED BY THE REGIONAL BOARD REGULATING ENFORCING IN THE HEAD THE USE OF PRODUCED WATER PONDS. IF THE IF THE COMMONLY GO OUT AND MONITOR THESE POINTS TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE SAFE AND THERE IS NO MIGRATION OCCURRING IF BY GRATION WAS OCCURRING THESE BONDS WOULD BE SHUT DOWN. OVER THE COURSE OF- THE LAST COUPLE OF DECADES TO THE RIVER THERE BUT SOME OPERATORS HAVE PHASED OUT THE USE BUT IT'S CRITICAL TO OUR OPERATORS AND SOME OF THE SMALLER OPERATORS. THAT THEY ALLOW THESE ONLINE PAWNS. OR WHERE THE BUSINESSES WHAT WILL GO OUT OF BUSINESS- I DO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING SOME AMENDMENTS AS IT RELATES TO BENEFICIAL USE. S. SPECIFIC TO GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AND- WATER TO AG. IT'S ONLY FOR EXISTING PROJECTS NOT FOR FUTURE PROJECTS OF WHICH MOST OF THE PRODUCERS ARE LOOKING AT NOW- SO AGAIN IF ALL OF THIS WERE OCCURRING. D. THE REGIONAL- QUALITY WATER BOARD WHICH AT THESE BONDS DOWN IMMEDIATELY- FOR THOSE REASONS WE WE'RE WE REMAIN OPPOSED AND WILL CONTINUE TO OPPOSE BUT LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE OFFICE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS IN OPPOSITION PLEASE- CHAIR AND MEMBERS- SEAN ONE TIME FROM THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT ALL THE PONDS THAT THIS BILL IMPACTS ARE IN KERN COUNTY- THERE NOWHERE ELSE- EVERY PRODUCED WATER POND AS THE PREVIOUS WITNESS- POINTED OUT IS UNDER THE WATCHFUL EYE OF THE WATER BOARD. THEY'RE ALL REGULATED MONITORED AND PERMITTED. AND AS WAS STATED THE WATER BOARD HAS FULL AUTHORITY TO SHUT DOWN ANY POND THAT IS NEGATIVELY IMPACTING DRINKING WATER GROUNDWATER. THEY ALREADY HAVE THAT AUTHORITY- THIS BILL- WHICH SHUT DOWN UP TO THREE MILLION BARRELS OF ANNUAL PRODUCTION IN KERN COUNTY- KERN COUNTY OIL WORKERS WOULD LOSE THEIR JOBS IN THE COUNTY AND LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES. WOULD LOSE CRITICAL TAXES NEEDED TO FUND VITAL PUBLIC SERVICES WORSE CALIFORNIA WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE THIS LOST KERN OIL WITH OIL FROM PLACES LIKE ECUADOR'S AMAZON RAINFOREST. MANY OF THE PONDS IN KERN COUNTY ARE FOR BENEFICIAL REUSE IN AGRICULTURE BUT MANY ARE NOT DUE TO THEIR HIGH SALINITY AND I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT. SEVEN MEMBERS HAVE FOR YEARS BEEN 1100% COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES ON CV SALTS WHICH IS THE CENTRAL VALLEY SALINITY ALTERNATIVES- FOR LONG TERM SOLUTIONS AND THE WATER BOARD'S REQUIRED BASIN PLAN AND BASIN PLAN AMENDMENT PROCESS. WHICH CONTAINS THREE SPECIFIC POND ORDERS THAT DEAL DIRECTLY WITH PRODUCED WATER PONDS. I'D ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THE CALIFORNIA IT IS CLEARLY- IN A PERPETUAL DROUGHT IN THE OIL INDUSTRY IS A KEY PARTNER WITH AGRICULTURE FARMERS HAVE DESCRIBED PRODUCED WATER FROM OIL PRODUCTION. AS A LIFELINE DURING TIMES OF DROUGHT- THE OIL INDUSTRY PROVIDES CRITICAL WATER NEEDED FOR THE IRRIGATION OF CROPS AND- CONTRARY TO WHAT IS STATED SOMETIMES IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN. OIL PRODUCERS- WE ARE A NET PRODUCER OF BENEFICIAL- USE WATER UP TO THE AMOUNT OF ABOUT FORTY THREE THOUSAND ACRE FEET PER YEAR- THIS BILL IS NOT ONLY UNNECESSARY BUT IT WOULD. CAUSE HARM SUPPORT SUPER RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE GO BACK TO THE PHONE LINES ANYONE IN SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION OR OPPOSITION. ON THE PHONE LINES. FOR COMMENTS IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION A. B. TWO FOUR FOUR SEVEN PLEASE PRESS ONE TO SPEND ZERO THAT COMMAND AGAIN ONE SEVEN ZERO. AND WE WILL START WITH LINE TWENTY SEVEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JENNIFER CLARY THE COMPANY DIRECTOR FOR CLEAN WATER ACTION AND I'M I'M SPEAKING AT THE PORT OF THIS BILL ON BEHALF OF OUR ORGANIZATION AS WELL AS LEADERSHIP COUNSEL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY THE COMMUNITY WATER CENTER BUT CENTRAL CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE NETWORK THANK YOU.

NATURAL RESOURCES IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL THANK YOU. AND THE- LINE. THIRTY ONE. GOOD AFTERNOON KIM DELFINO- REPRESENTING DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. BLIND THIRTY THREE. HELLO THIS IS BILL ELLIOTT WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP IT WAS MY WORK ALONG WITH A COLLEAGUE FROM CLEAN WATER ACTION THAT BROUGHT THIS ISSUE TO THE REGIONAL WATER BOARD ATTENTION I WOULD NOT CALL IT OVER REGULATED NOW THEY'RE STILL CATCHING UP WITH ALL THE PONDS ABOUT A THIRD OF WHICH HAD NO PERMITS ARE ALSO A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. IN THE AG ISSUE IS NOT A FACTOR HERE THE BILL TAKE CARE OF THAT BENEFICIAL USE. THANK YOU. IN A LINE OF THIRTY. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS ELENA ORTIZ ON BEHALF OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL ACTION FUND IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. IN LINE TWENTY SIX. GEN MOURNED BONTA CREEK IN SUPPORT. AND WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU TO MISTER FLORA FOR TAKING OVER WHILE I WAS VOTING IN REVENUE TAX- ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MR FLOOR THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I THINK IT AFTER CORPORATE BRING THIS FORWARD YOU'RE ALWAYS OF THE VERY THOUGHTFUL- COLLEAGUES I APPRECIATE THAT I DO HAVE JUST A COUPLE CONCERNS ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR BILL IN. AND LARGEST COME FROM A CENTRAL VALLEY PERSPECTIVE- THE CONCERNS AT THIS BILL CAN REALLY REDUCE THE SUPPLY OF TWO THINGS THAT ARE VITAL. TO OUR WAY OF LIFE IT'S WATER AND QUITE FRANKLY FUEL AND OF WHERE YOU ARE RIGHT NOW- MINUTE DROP SO ANYTHING THAT IS DONE TO LESSEN. THE POTENTIAL WATER SUPPLY I HAVE STRONG CONCERNS ABOUT AS WELL AS WE HAVE SIX DOLLARS OUR FUEL SIX DOLLARS A GALLON FUEL NOT AN HOUR. BUT SIX DOLLARS GALLON FUEL. YAHOO KIDDING THE CUTTING YOU KNOW COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND BARRELS OF THE FUEL OUT OF THE SYSTEM I THINK COULD BE DEVASTATING AND IN THE WORLD WE LIVE IN RIGHT NOW I THINK THAT'S A LITTLE BUT THE WRONG APPROACH I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT RIGHT NOW THERE'S A LOT OF FEASIBILITY STUDIES AT THE STATE WATER BOARD THE LOCAL WATER DISTRICTS ARE DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS WATER CAN BE RECLAIMED AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE US TO TAKE A PAUSE. AND LET THEM DO IT JOBS- BECAUSE IF WE CAN RECLAIM WATER WASTE WATER FROM OUR CITIES AND REVIEWS THAT I FEEL LIKE WE CAN GET THE TECHNOLOGY RIGHT REVIEWS SOME OF THIS WATER FOR OTHER ISSUES OTHER THAN JUST AGRICULTURE SO THANK YOU. YES SO. AS THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM WHICH VÀ SAID. IT'S NOT OUR INTENTION AND THAT BELIEVE THE BILL AS CURRENTLY BEING AMENDED WELL ABSOLUTELY NOT TOUCH BENEFICIAL REUSE THE PEOPLE WHO SUPPORTED THE PEOPLE WHO OPPOSE IT THIS BILL WILL BE COMPLETELY NEUTRAL ON THAT. AND WE WILL NOT SO FAR AS I CAN SEE CHANGE ONE DROP. FROM BENEFICIAL RE USE THAT'S A SEPARATE ISSUE ABSOLUTELY. SO WHAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT HERE IS THE FACT THAT THE WATER BOARD REALLY DOESN'T REGULATE THESE POTS IN AN EFFECTIVE WAY- AND ALTHOUGH THE CENTRAL VALLEY REGIONAL BOARD HAS DONE A LOT OF HARD WORK ON THIS ISSUE. THE CURRENT REGULATIONS ROUND ONLINE PICTURE EXTREMELY CUMBERSOME FOR ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED OF THEM. WERE NEGATIVE IMPACTS TO GROUNDWATER QUALITY DETECTED THE REGIONAL BOARD MUST METICULOUSLY DOCUMENT THE IMPACT. AND ISSUE SHE SHOULD DESIST ORDERS. IT BY. WITH FIVE HUNDRED PIPS. YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO GET TO THE END OF THIS. REGIONAL BOARD IS ACTED TO SHUT DOWN SOME TIPS BUT THEY HAVE TO ADDRESS EACH SITUATION INDIVIDUALLY. AND THE PROCEEDS CAN BE DRAGGED OUT BY LITIGATION RESOURCES BEING SPENT BASICALLY MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO LOOK AT ALL FIVE HUNDRED OF THESE THEY'VE GOT A LOOK AT THEM ONE BY ONE- IF A- IF THE OPPOSITION WANTS TO TALK ABOUT A MORE EFFECTIVE REGULATING REGIME WE COULD TALK ABOUT THAT. OF BUT RIGHT NOW WE DO SEE THE IMPACT OF THIS ON WHAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE USABLE GROUNDWATER SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS APPROACH IF THE OPPOSITION WANTS TO GET HELP TAKE ANOTHER APPROACH BUT THE CURRENT APPROACH ISN'T WORKING AT ALL AND I'D BE GLAD TO TALK WITH THE OPPOSITION ABOUT IT SO THANK YOU AND- ALWAYS FOR IS THE- OKAY SO THE AMOUNT OF. OIL WERE TALKING ABOUT IS 1% OF CURRENT PRODUCTION PRODUCTION. THE OTHER 9899% OF THE WELLS FREE INJECT THE WATER UNDERGROUND. AND THAT'S WHAT I WOULD EXPECT TO HAPPEN IF THIS BILL PASSES THAT INSTEAD OF PUTTING IT ONLINE PETS WORK CONTAMINATE THE WATER. IN THE AIR. ARE THAT IT WOULD BE RE INJECTED UNDERGROUND WHICH IS WHAT WE GET 98299% OF THE PRODUCTION. ALREADY DIED SO WE'RE JUST ASKING THEM TO DO WHAT THE OTHER PEOPLE DO ALREADY. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR QUESTION AS ALWAYS- IT'S VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SCENE NINE- I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY- WE HAVE TO WE HAVE A MOTION. HELLO OKAY THE MOTION BY MCCARTY- SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOL GREEN EFFORTS PARTICULARLY FOR SCHOOLS LOCATED IN DISADVANTAGED- LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. CALIFORNIA IS EXPERIENCING ESCALATING INCONSISTENT EXTREME HEAT DAYS DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE CHILDREN WHO ATTEND URBAN SCHOOLS WITH LITTLE TO NO TREE CANOPIES ART AN INCREASED RISK FOR HEAT RELATED ILLNESSES LIKE SKIN CANCER AND ASTHMA. BY CONVERTING PAVED AREAS INTO GREENER SPACES THIS LEGISLATION WILL HELP MEDIATE HIGH TEMPERATURES AND IMPROVE THE OVERALL HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF STUDENTS HERE WITH ME TODAY SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF AB TWO FIVE SIX SIX IS ALFREDO- DANDO ON BEHALF OF THE TREEPEOPLE AND SASHA HOROWITZ LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF THE- LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. OKAY THANKS FOR THE MISTRUST ON THE- I GET AFTERNOON CHERRY THIS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS AND FEDERAL ON THE AND I'M PROVIDING COMMENTS TO SUPPORT AB TWO FIVE SIX SIX ON BEHALF OF TREEPEOPLE SPONSORS OF THE OF THE MEASURE. THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE INTRODUCED BY SOMEONE WERE CALDERON AS PART OF A LARGER LEGISLATIVE EFFORT TO MEANINGFULLY ADDRESS EXTREME HEAT THROUGH A MULTITUDE OF COOLING SOLUTIONS THAT PROTECT FARMWORKERS HOMEOWNERS AND THE MOST UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE THREE PEOPLE AS THE LARGEST ENVIRONMENTAL NONPROFIT BASED IN LOS ANGELES UNITS WITH COMMUNITIES TO GROW GREENER MORE RESILIENT HOMES NEIGHBORHOODS AND SCHOOLS. ALL THROUGH THE LENS OF NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS THAT REINFORCE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AS YOU KNOW THERE ARE A MYRIAD OF SCIENTIFIC STUDIES THAT DEMONSTRATE HOW CLIMATE CHANGE IS ALREADY EXACERBATING THE NUMBER OF EXTREME HEAT DAYS IN CALIFORNIA. WITH THAT SAID TRIPLE HAS A STRONG INTEREST YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH L. U. S. T. FOR EXAMPLE IN CONDUCTING READING PROJECTS AT SCHOOLS IN PROVIDING ACADEMIC CONTENT TIED TO OUTDOOR ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION AND NATURAL RESOURCES INVESTMENTS FOR STUDENTS THAT ONLY THE PHYSICAL BETTERMENT OF THEIR ENVIRONMENT BUT ALSO IN FOSTERING BETTER ACADEMIC OUTCOMES AS WELL. HOWEVER EXISTING PROGRAMS AND FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THESE PROJECTS HAVE BEEN VERY PIECEMEAL AND LACK A CLEAR FOCUS ON SCHOOL SITES. AB TWO FIVE SIX SIX REMEDIES THIS BY LEVERAGING THEIR EXISTING URBAN AND COMMUNITY FORESTRY PROGRAM. AND THE URBAN GREENING PROGRAM TO PROVIDE GRANTS FOR SCHOOL GREENING IN A UNIFIED MANNER THAT. TAKES IN THE BEST OF THESE PROGRAMS AND ALSO CENTERS OF THE ROLE OF- THE ROLE THAT LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES NEED TO PLAY IN THESE PROJECTS MOVING FORWARD AS WELL. WELL NOT MENTION THE CURRENT ALSO SO I WANTED TO END BY SAYING THAT.

AFTERNOON TERRY BISSON MEMBERS SOCIAL WORK WITH WITH THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY SIX HER WE DID NOT HAVE A LETTER PREPARED IN TIME FOR THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. ALL STUDENTS DESERVE ACCESS TO OUTDOOR LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES AND A SUSTAINABLE AND HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT. THIS PREVENTS NOT ONLY HELP MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE BUT THEY TEACH STUDENTS ABOUT OUTDOOR LITERACY ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP. AND OUR PLACE IN NATURE. AS THE LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE STATE AND THE SECOND LARGEST IN THE COUNTRY LOS ANGELES UNIFIED HAS MADE EXPANDING OUTDOOR LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS AND CREATING GREEN SPACES KEY PRIORITIES FOR THE DISTRICT. LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SERVES A POPULATION OF NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS AND REDUCED PRICE LUNCH AND MANY OF WHOM LIVE IN AREAS OF HIGH PARKING. THIS BILL WILL ENABLE NOT ONLY LOS ANGELES UNIFIED BUT HUNDREDS OF OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND SCHOOL SITES ACROSS THE STATE TO ACCESS THE RESOURCES THEY NEED. TO GREEN THEIR CAMPUSES IN AREAS WITH THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF LOW INCOME FAMILIES. THE DIVERSE PROJECTS FUNDED UNDER THIS PROPOSAL WILL CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCING THE HEAT ISLAND EFFECT IN IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR STUDENTS AND COMMUNITIES. PROJECTS LIKE BUILDING COMMUNITY GARDENS OPENING CAMPUS AND COMMUNITY PARKS PLANTING TREES CAPTURING STORM WATER AND INSTALLING REFLECTIVE SURFACES. WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS PROPOSAL BALANCES THE GOALS OF REDUCING AMBIENT HEAT WITH THE PRACTICAL CONCERNS OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHOSE CAMPUSES WILL BE IMPROVED BY THESE GREENING PROJECTS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CALDERON AND HERS. STAFF HAVE BEEN VERY RESPONSIVE TO THE OBSTACLES THE DISTRICTS LIKE OURS TO FACE IN TRYING TO MAKE THESE PROJECTS WORKED IN THE PAST. SINCE THESE PROJECTS ARE CAMPUS BASED WE ARE APPRECIATIVE OF PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT WILL ENSURE THAT ANY GRANT RECIPIENT MUST HAVE A FORMAL AGREEMENT WITH THE SCHOOL WHERE THE IMPROVEMENTS WILL TAKE PLACE BEFORE APPLYING FOR THE GRANT. THIS ONE SURE THE PROJECTS ARE FEASIBLE APPROPRIATELY SCOPED AND HAVE BUY IN FROM THE DISTRICT WHILE ALSO FACILITATING GENUINE PARTNERSHIPS THAT BUILD ON THE EXPERTISE OF LOCAL NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AND PUBLIC AGENCIES. THANK YOU AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR PRIVATE. THANK YOU. WE DON'T HAVE ANY WITNESSES REGISTERED IN OPPOSITION SO WE'LL GO AHEAD AND OPEN IT UP TO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES.

STREET ALL IN SUPPORT THANK YOU COMMENT THAT THE- ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISTER SEYARTO. SO I DIDN'T HEAR ANY WATER DISTRICTS IN SUPPORT OF THIS- IT SEEMS LIKE WE'VE GONE THROUGH THIS YOU KNOW IN THE LAST FORTY YEARS- HAVE AND HAVING ALL OF OUR PUBLIC AGENCIES AND SCHOOLS INCLUDING SCHOOLS SCALE DOWN THEIR USE OF WATER. AND A LOT OF THAT LED TO. YOU KNOW BASICALLY THE PLAYGROUNDS THAT WERE PAVEMENT INSTEAD OF GRASS IN THE GRASS DIDN'T LAST THAT LONG ANYWAY SO HOW DO YOU WORK WITH THE WATER DISTRICTS- TO NOT. IMPACT THE SCHOOLS FINANCIALLY BECAUSE THAT WAS A HUGE BILL THAT WAS ONE OF THE INCENTIVES FOR THEM NOT TO HAVE ANY MORE WAS BECAUSE WATER. KEPT ESCALATING IN AND AS LESS AND LESS WATER IS AVAILABLE TO BE ABLE TO- AT GROVE YOU KNOW AND URBAN FOREST- IT IT SEEMS LIKE IT MIGHT BE A WASTE OF TIME- BECAUSE WE KEEP GOING BACK AND FORTH. BETWEEN THE TWO- IT'S NOT A WASTE OF TIME TO YOU KNOW I OBVIOUSLY BE GREAT TO HAVE THESE FOR US BUT IT IT IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT'S REALISTIC IN THE WORLD WE LIVE IN WITH THE WATER. AND AND THE EFFORT THAT HAS GONE ON FOR THE LAST FORTY YEARS TO GET AWAY FROM THAT USE OF WATER BECAUSE OF THE EXPENSE AND THE LACK OF THE RESOURCE ITSELF SO HOW DO YOU GUYS IN THAT INDUSTRY. DEAL WITH THAT PART OF IT. AT THE YOU FOR THE QUESTION- ON BEHALF OF TREAT PEOPLE I WOULD SAY THAT- THE APPROACH THAT ASSEMBLYMEMBER CALDERON IS TAKING HERE BY LEVERAGING EXISTING PROGRAMS. ACTUALLY DOES A GOOD JOB OF ADDRESSING THAT VERY CONCERNED- AND IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT- I THINK SCHOOL DISTRICTS AS WELL AS NON PROFITS THAT ARE WORKING ON. EXPANDING SCHOOL GREENING- TO SCHOOLS LIKE THEY DON'T HAVE IT IT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVE TO SOLVE FOR. WITHIN THE EXISTING URBAN AND COMMUNITY FORESTRY PROGRAM AND URBAN GREENING THINGS LIKE- UTILIZATION OF BIO SWALES AND CISTERNS AS A WAY OF CAPTURING WHENEVER THERE IS. A HEAVY DELUDE CAPTURING AS MUCH OF THAT STORMWATER ON SITE. TO BE ABLE TO USE IT WITHIN THE IRVING READING LANDSCAPE. IT IS A KEY COMPONENT SOMETHING THAT- I THINK A LOT OF THE PROJECT THAT WE'VE SEEN. HAVE- ALWAYS INCORPORATED AS A WAY OF ADDRESSING A PART OF THAT THE OTHER PART IS ADDRESSED BY- UTILIZATION OF. SOME BEST PRACTICES AROUND WHICH KINDS OF PLANTS WHICH KIND OF TREES ARE THE MOST APPROPRIATE ESPECIALLY AS OUR CLIMATE IS CHANGING. UTILIZING EXAMPLES AND OTHER STATES LIKE SAY ARIZONA WHERE. I THINK AS AS WE CAN ALL IMAGINE SIMILAR ISSUES AROUND WATER SCARCITY AND HOW YOU PRIORITIZE- MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE. AND THEN I THINK AS WE'VE HEARD YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S THAT THE BROADER IMPLICATION OF. HOW ARE WE GOING TO PRIORITIZE THE SCHOOL GREENING- VERSUS OTHER COMPETING USES AND I THINK HERE YOU KNOW THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF BENEFITING STUDENTS IS ONE THAT. IS DRIVING US FORWARD IN THIS CONVERSATION. OKAY ANY OTHER. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY WELL I WOULD LIKE TO THANK MISS CALDERON- FOR WORKING ON HIS IMPORTANT ISSUE YOU KNOW YEARS A FEW YEARS AGO I WORKED ON A SIMILAR BILL- AND UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR- AND I WANNA MAKE A FEW COMMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT. IF THE ADMINISTRATION IS HEARING THIS- YOU KNOW THAT- YOU KNOW THEY'LL HEAR WHY THIS SHOULD BE A PRIORITY THIS YEAR WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF- IN THE VETO MESSAGE OF MY BILL- THAT THE I WAS TOLD THAT THE STATE WAS ALREADY INVESTING IN AN OUTDOOR EQUITY GRANTS PROGRAM WHILE I AM SUPPORTIVE OF THAT GRANT PROGRAM. WHAT IT DOES IS TAKE STUDENTS THAT LIVE IN OUR COMMUNITIES- THAT SUFFER FROM EXTREME HATE TO HAVE VERY LITTLE GREEN SPACE TAKE THEM OUT ON A FIELD TRIP. YOU KNOW SOMEWHERE FAR AWAY FROM HOME WHICH IS I THINK A GREAT EXPERIENCE BUT IT'S NOT THE SAME AS HAVING ACCESS TO GREEN SPACE EVERY DAY IN YOUR COMMUNITY THIS IS LIKE A BASIC RIGHT YOU KNOW I GREW UP- ATTENDING LAUSD SCHOOLS WITH VERY LITTLE GREEN SPACE SO YOU'RE FORCED TO GO OUT AND PLAY IN THE YARD. IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY WHICH IS ONE OF THE HOTTEST AREAS OF LOS ANGELES A WITH NO SHAPE NO ACCESS TO SHADE AND YOU HAVE TO BE OUT THERE MAY THERE IS NO OTHER OPTION- AND SO I THINK THAT THIS IS WHY I THINK THIS BILL SHOULD BE A PRIORITY FOR THE GOVERNOR- THIS YEAR- AND I AM IN FULL SUPPORT- AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS- TO. THE ASSEMBLY AND I WOULD LOVE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR WITH I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU ON IS A CO AUTHOR AND I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NAY VOTE.

THANK YOU VERYMUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TO AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY SEVEN- FIRST I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ALTHOUGH I WOULD LIKE TO- STATE TO THAT THAT I DO BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS- EFFORT FOR WHAT FOR PREVENTION AND SO- I WILL AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS- SUGGESTS A CONTINUE TO- WORK WITH THE CURRENT. DEPUTY DIRECTOR. I'LL COMMITTEE WATER PREPAREDNESS- TO IT TO SEE. HOW WE CAN WORK WITH- THE DEPARTMENT AND THE ADMINISTRATION I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE. MR ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD- THIS IS BUILDING ON YOUR ASSEMBLY BILL NINE- TO ADDRESS AN ISSUE THAT- THAT I AND I'M SURE MANY MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE HAVE REPEATEDLY HEARD- THE MULTIPLE- GREEN TAPE AS AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS- CALLS OUT- DIFFERENT AGENCIES- HAVING TO.

ALSO A LICENSED FORESTER IN THE STATED JUSTICE MAYES ME EVERY SUMMER WE ALL SEE WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR WOODS FOR LOSING MILLIONS OF ACRES- WE'VE ONLY GOT ABOUT THIRTY TWO MILLION ACRES IN THE STATE SO YOU CAN KIND OF DO THE MATH AND SEE THAT BOY. IF WE KEEP GOING AT THE RATE WE'RE GOING. WE'RE GONNA BE IN DIRE STRAITS HERE IN THE STATE. SO WE DO NEED TO GET TO THIS GOAL THAT THE STATE HAS A FIVE THOUSAND ACRES AS SOON AS PART. AND WE NEED TO GET TO IT WITH MEANINGFUL ACRES- AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT YOU SEE PART. THINKING ABOUT COUNTING AT LEAST AT THE STATE LEVEL FOR. TO MEET THIS GOAL AND THE REASON THAT'S IN THERE IS. THAT WE'VE HAD TIMBER HARVEST PERMITS FOR FORTY FIVE YEARS OR SO AND THE WILDFIRE SITUATIONS JUST GOTTEN WORSE OVER. GOOD TO BE TRUE ABOUT MEETING IN THE SCHOOL WE NEED TO DO IT WITH- GRANT PROJECTS OTHER PERMITS OUTSIDE OF THE TIMBER HARVEST PERMITS AT- WE USE TODAY. AND ON TOP THESE WHAT IRIS- WE JUST HEARD IT FOR THE FORESTRY MEETING- THAT JUST LAST MONTH ABOUT THE OF FORCE PASSED REPORT. AND THE NUMBER OF DEAD TREES WE HAVE IN THIS YEAR IS THERE NOW- YOU KNOW THAT'S UP TO A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DEAD TREES NOW ON TOP OF THE WILDFIRE IMPACTS WE REALLY NEED TO GET TO THIS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRE GOAL QUICKLY. AND WE NEED TO. PRIORITIZE THESE PROJECTS AND SO THAT'S WHAT- THIS PERSON WOULD DO- IS HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO PRIORITIZE ALL THOSE PROJECTS TO TRY AND GET TO AT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND HER GOAL- WITH GETTING FULL PROJECTS.

MISTER WHAT ARE YOU READY TO PRESENT. THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS- FIRST BY LIKE TO START BATES EXCEPT IN THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL. MEMBERS THE WILDFIRE CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA HAS IMPACTED ALL OF US. UNFORTUNATELY THIS CRISIS TOOK DECADES TO DEVELOP AND IT WILL TAKE US AT LEAST THAT LONG TO CORRECT. AB TWENTY FOUR SEVENTY NINE REQUIRES NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY IN CALIFORNIA TO FOCUS ON LONG TERM OUTCOMES IN OUR NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS. THERE IS PERHAPS NO STEP MORE CRITICAL TO CHANGING THE CURRENT FIRE RISK ACROSS CALIFORNIA THEN DRAMATICALLY INCREASING THE USE OF PRESCRIBED FIRE. THE FOREST MANAGEMENT PASSPORT HAS TO TASK FORCES SET TARGETS FOR CALIFORNIA BURNED FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES- ANNUALLY STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THIS BILL CODIFIES THAT GOAL REQUIRES CHALFORD REPORT WHAT STEPS IT INTENDS TO TAKE TO MEET THAT GOAL. SECOND THIS BILL FOLLOWS UP ON A PIECE OF MY LEGISLATION THAT REQUIRED THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN FOR FOREST AND WATERSHED RESTORATION IN ORVILLE SHASTA AND TRINITY WATERSHEDS. THIS BILL WAS SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR GOVERNOR BROWN IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND UNFORTUNATELY SEEMS TO HAVE FALLEN BY THE WAYSIDE. FINALLY AB TWENTY FOUR SEVENTY NINE REQUIRES STATE AGENCIES TO PRIORITIZE RESTORATION PROJECTS THAT ENSURE THE PROJECT AREA WILL MAINTAIN THE DESIRED CONDITIONS. OTHER WORDS ARE GOING TO SPEND PUBLIC'S DOLLAR PUBLIC DOLLARS ON RESTORING LANDSCAPES AND ECOSYSTEMS. WE SHOULD BE PRIORITIZING THE INVESTMENTS THAT WON'T TURN INTO A STRIP MALL THE CLEAR CUT. WERE A FIRE HAZARD FIVE YEARS FROM NOW. ALLISER SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THIS- HOW THIS WILL BE OCT ACCOMPLISHMENT COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE AGENCY. AND STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THERE ARE NO UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. HERE TO TESTIFY SUPPORT IS PAUL MASON WITH PACIFIC FOREST TRUST. MORNING UP ON MASON WITH THE POOREST TRUST- THIS IS AN AREA OF POLICIES EVOLVING VERY VERY QUICKLY RIGHT NOW EXPECTED THE WORLD WILL LOOK DIFFERENT AFTER THE MAY REVISE AND AFTER THE JUNE BUDGET AND IT'S WILL PROBABLY CONTINUE TO BE AN EVOLVING CONVERSATION TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT- THE AUTHOR HAD REFERENCE THERE. I THINK AT THE CORE IS HOW DO WE CONTINUE TO REALLY DRIVE TOWARDS HAVING MORE GOOD FIRE ON THE LANDSCAPE THE PERVERSE OUTCOME OF SPENDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR ON FIRE SUPPRESSION IS WORTH LOOKING FOR THE MOST DAMAGING FIRES. AND SO WE REALLY NEED TO AS A STATE GET OUR HEAD AROUND HOW DO WE HAVE MORE FIRE THAT HAS THE SORT OF OUTCOMES ON THE LANDSCAPE THAT WE WANT. AND WE'RE THIS BILL CODIFIES THE TARGETS THAT- ARE IN THE RECENTLY RELEASED ACTION PLAN WHICH ARE MODEST BUT THEN SETS MORE ASPIRATIONAL TARGETS ON FOR TWENTY THIRTY. AND ALSO AS THE AUTHOR NOTED BACK IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE COLLABORATED ON TRYING TO HAVE THE STATE COME UP WITH A PLAN FOR THOSE MOST IMPORTANT WATERSHEDS THAT FORM THE BACKBONE OF THE STATE AND FEDERAL WATER SYSTEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT HAS JUST VANISHED. AND NOT COME TO FRUITION SO I THINK MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY PRIORITIZING IN THOSE AREAS THAT ARE SO IMPORTANT AND THEN FINALLY PRIORITIZING THE SORTS OF INVESTMENTS THERE CAN HAVE TERRIBLE OUTCOMES AND NOT SAY WE CAN'T FIND THINGS THAT DON'T HAVE GUARANTEES OF LONG TERM POSITIVE MANAGEMENT BUT THAT WE EMPHASIZE THOSE THAT DO. THANK YOU- SO WE ARE READY FOR. ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION. FOR STARTING IN THE HEARING ROOM. THANKS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CHRISTMAS CEILIDH ON BEHALF OF HUMBOLDT MENDOCINO REDWOOD COMPANIES AND WE APPRECIATE DR WHICH COMMITMENT TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS WE DISEASE- SUBMIT A SUPPORT OF AMENDED LETTER THANK YOU.

WHEN I THINK THE COMMITTEE FOR ALL THEIR HARD WORK AND CONSIDERATION OF THIS BILL AND I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TODAY. AND THE BAY AREA REFINERIES ARE SOME OF THE LARGEST SOURCES OF POLLUTION I'VE ONE OF THEM IN MY DISTRICT AND I'M GETTING ANOTHER ONE WITH REDISTRICTING. OVERALL COMPLIANCE WITH AIR QUALITY REQUIREMENTS HAVE DECLINED IN RECENT YEARS WITH INCREASING FLARING EVENTS. SPECIFICALLY IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE BAY AREA QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT ISSUED OVER TWO HUNDRED FORTY NOTICES OF VIOLATIONS TO BAY AREA REFINERIES. THE INCREASE FLOODING EVENTS AND DECLINE IN COMPLIANCE WITH AIR QUALITY REGULATIONS HAVE SEVERE IN HAVE SEVERE IMPACTS. ON THESE COMMUNITIES AS THEY- EXPOSE- THESE COMMUNITIES MY COMMUNITIES TO TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS WHICH LEAD TO SHELTER IN PLACE NOTIFICATIONS. AND INCREASED HEALTH AND PUBLIC HEALTH RISKS. SPECIFICALLY IN MY DISTRICT THERE HAVE BEEN INCREASES IN AIR POLLUTION COMPLAINTS THE LACK OF COMPLIANCE AND INCREASE FLARING EVENTS HAVE LED TO. A INCIDENCES THAT HAVE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AND IMPACTED SCHOOLS IN THE SURROUNDING AREAS. TO ADDRESS THE OVERALL DECLINE IN COMPLIANCE WITH AIR QUALITY REGULATIONS HE EIGHTEEN NINETY SEVEN WILL INCREASE THE CIVIL PENALTY PENALTY CEILINGS FOR VIOLATIONS OF STATE. OR LOCAL AIR QUALITY RULES TO THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OF THE VIOLATION RESULTS DISRUPTIONS COMMUNITY. CIVIL WE WILL ALSO BE USED. TO ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS PROVIDE. FOR SUBSEQUENT VIOLATIONS WITHIN A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD. I WANT TO THANK THE BILL'S SPONSORS THE BAY AREA. THE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT AND I WILL LET ME WITNESSES HERE SELF AND- SELF I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NOT COMMITTEE I'M ALLEN ABS REPRESENTING THE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT AND SPONSOR OF AB EIGHTEEN NINETY SEVEN. PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN REFINERY COMMUNITIES EXPERIENCE SOME OF THE HIGHEST CUMULATIVE HEALTH BURDENS IN CALIFORNIA EVEN IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE REFINERIES ARE OPERATING WITHIN ALL THEIR PERMIT CONDITIONS. UNFORTUNATELY REFINERIES DON'T ALWAYS OPERATE WITHIN THEIR PERMIT CONDITIONS IN IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE ALONE THE AIR DISTRICT ISSUED OVER TWO HUNDRED FORTY NOTICES OF VIOLATION. REFINERY COMMUNITY RESIDENTS ALSO EXPERIENCED AT LEAST THIRTY FLARING EVENTS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THIS IS ACTUALLY A DECREASE IN FLARING COMPARED TO TWENTY NINETEEN ONE REFINERY COMMUNITIES EXPERIENCED SEVENTY TWO FLARING EVENTS. THAT'S A FLARING EVENT EVERY FIVE DAYS WHERE YOU MIGHT BE TOLD TO STAY INSIDE YOUR CHILD MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO GO TO SCHOOL OR YOU MIGHT HAVE TO SEEK MEDICAL CARE BECAUSE OF EXCESS EMISSIONS OF SULFUR OXIDES PARTICULATE MATTER PENALTY SEALING FOR THESE EVENTS WITH TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TWO THOUSAND. AND IS RISEN ONLY 9% AND TWENTY TWO YEARS. IMAGINE BEING A REFINERY COMMUNITY RESIDENT AND KNOWING THAT THIS TYPE OF DESTRUCTION IN YOUR COMMUNITY IS ONLY WORTH SLIGHTLY OVER A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR FINE. IN THE COMPANIES MAKING RECORD PROFITS. I'D LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS FOR HER LEADERSHIP IN ALL THREE NAY BE EIGHTEEN NINETY SEVEN WHICH TAKES A SMALL STEP TOWARDS BETTER ALIGNING PENALTIES FOR REFINERIES VIOLATING AIR QUALITY PERMITS. CAUSING COMMUNITY DESTRUCTIONS IN ENDANGERING PUBLIC HEALTH AB EIGHTEEN NOT EIGHTEEN NINETY SEVEN PROPOSES A MODEST INCREASE TO THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR CERTAIN PENALTIES AT REFINERIES. IN A FURTHER INCREASE FOR REPETITIVE VIOLATIONS THE BURDEN REFINERY COMMUNITIES WHILE THESE MODEST AMOUNTS CAN'T FULLY MITIGATE THE IMPACTS IN THESE COMMUNITIES WE HOPE IT DISCOURAGES THINKING ABOUT THESE EVENTS AS A MINOR COST OF DOING BUSINESS. THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING THIS BILL I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS BILL MCGOVERN WITH THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR IN SUPPORT. I THINK THIS IS A REALLY STRAIGHTFORWARD BILL. PENALTIES NEED TO BE HIGH ENOUGH TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR AND- AND RIGHT NOW THEY'RE NOT. AND THEY HAVEN'T EVEN KEPT PACE WITH INFLATION AND THE CONSEQUENCES ARE REAL. PEOPLE ARE HAVING TO BREATHE UNHEALTHY AIR. BECAUSE OF VIOLATIONS BY THE REFINERIES SO THIS BILL WOULD TAKE A STEP TOWARDS CORRECTING THAT- YOU KNOW IT MAY BE THAT THE FAMILY SHOULD BE EVEN HIGHER BUT- WE SUPPORT THIS AS A- SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT. ON THE STATUS QUO SO WE URGE YOU TO PASS IT TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU UP NEXT WE HAVE A WITNESS IN OPPOSITION- MISTER ZACHARY LEARY FROM THE WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS SACKLER ON BEHALF OF THE WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION- WE HAVE RESPECTFULLY TAKEN A OPPOSE POSITION TO AB EIGHTEEN NINETY SEVEN OUR CONCERNS CAN BROADLY BE BROKEN DOWN INTO THREE CATEGORIES. OF FIRST THE BILL ARBITRARILY RAISES THE PENALTIES UP FROM 1-000-023-0000 WHICH IS CONCERN IS WITH REGARDS TO THE DEFINITION THAT WOULD TRIGGER THESE PENALTIES- BY INCLUDING BROAD LANGUAGE OF DISRUPTION TO THE COMMUNITY THAT. SEEMS A BIT SUBJECTIVE TO WIN THESE PENALTIES WOULD BE INCREASED THEN PLIED IN SITUATIONS UP ON THE STATE- AND THEN FINALLY THE BILL SETS A NEW PRECEDENT WITH REGARDS TO A SINGLE IT SINGLING OUT A SINGLE INDUSTRY WITH REGARDS TO AIR VIOLATIONS- THIS NEW BILL CREATES NOW A TWO TIER. SYSTEM WITHIN THE PENALTY STRUCTURE TRADITIONALLY THOSE HAVE APPLIED EQUALLY ACROSS TITLE FIVE FACILITIES- UNDER THIS NEW APPROACH YOU'LL SEE SIMILARLY SITUATED TITLE FIVE PERMIT HOLDERS- TREATED DIFFERENTLY FOR SIMILAR SIMILAR AIR QUALITY VIOLATION- THIS WILL NOW CREATE A PIECEMEAL APPROACH WITHIN THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE AS A- AS IT PERTAINS TO THE- PENALTIES WITH REGARD TO- AIR QUALITY. UNFORTUNATELY WITH THE S. THREE I BOUGHT A YEAR NO VOTE TODAY. TO NO VOTE TODAY ON A V. EIGHT NINETIES. THANK YOU I'VE NEXT RAY FOR A WEIGHT STARTING IN THE HEARING ROOM. PLEASE GO AHEAD.

AND THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS OVER THE YEARS. UPDATED HERE FOR EXAMPLE IT'S JUST THE PREVENT AIR QUALITY VIOLATIONS- THAT ARE HAPPENING. IN OUR COMMUNITIES. IN A PERFECT WORLD WE WOULD- HAVE THE CURRENT- THE CURRENT PENALTIES AND WE WOULD HAVE- VIOLATIONS BUT THE REALITY THAT THEY BECOME JUST. A WAY OF DOING BUSINESS THAT IS IN THAT THE- VIOLATIONS JUST ABSORB. AND IT'S NOT DETERRING- THE AIR QUALITY VIOLATIONS AND CONSEQUENTLY IT'S HORTON- OUR COMMUNITIES AT CERTAIN OUR KIDS WHEN THEY'RE HAVING A BRIEF OR SMELL- THESE HORRIFIC- EITHER POLLUTANTS. OR SMELLED IN THE AIR OUR AREA FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE. FIVE VIOLATORS WHO. OUTSIDE OF THE- EXCITE AND OTHERS THAT YOU. ALL HAVE HEARD ME TALK ABOUT OVER THE YEARS. BUT BY RENDERING PLANTS HAVE NOT. A DECREASE THEIR AIR QUALITY VIOLATIONS- AND JUST CONTINUE TO ABSORB- THE CURRENT- PENALTIES. SO WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS INCREASE IT AND THANK YOU FOR HELPING US BOTH ON THE STRIP CLUB BILLION AND NEGLIGENCE WITH THE OF THE AMENITY RECOMMENDED. WHICH WE HOPE WILL DETOUR. BUT IF NOT BE ABLE TO PENALIZE THEM- SO THAT THEY DON'T DO THIS- I UNDERSTAND ALL BUT WE'RE STILL GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK ON LANGUAGE- THAT REFLECT WHAT YOU AND I TALKED ABOUT WHICH WAS THE MOST IMPACTED.

PLEASE GO AHEAD GOOD AFTERNOON- MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS TERRENCE MANN AND I'M THE DEPUTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT AT SOUTH BECAUSE THEY CAN BE AB TWENTY NINE TEN WOULD PROVIDE MORE MEANINGFUL DETERRENCE FOR AIR QUALITY VIOLATIONS ESPECIALLY IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES- BY RAISING LIMITS ON CERTAIN CIVIL PENALTIES UNDER THE EXISTING LAW A COMPANY OR FACILITY CAN VIOLATE OUR QUALITY REGULATIONS RULES PERMIT CONDITIONS AND THEY'RE STRICTLY LIABLE FOR NO MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THAT'S PER VIOLATION. PER DAY- AND STRICT LIABILITY IS THE MOST COMMON- LEVEL THAT WE USE IN OUR FORCING ACTIONS ALSO IF A FACILITY OR COMPANY IS ABLE TO ESTABLISH AN AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE THAT THEY WEREN'T NEGLIGENT OR DIDN'T DO IT INTENTIONALLY THE MAXIMUM PENALTY GOES DOWN TO FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND SO WHILE THESE CAN BE SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS TO A SMALL MOM AND POP TYPE OF FACILITY OR COMPANY- IT THERE IS VERY LITTLE VALUE FORMER TALKING ABOUT BIG COMPANIES AND WELL FUNDED VIOLATORS- IT'S REALLY JUST A SLAP ON THE WRIST REST AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER NOTED THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS- AND IT ALSO DOESN'T MATTER HOW EXTENSIVE THE AIR QUALITY VIOLATION IS SO- AS AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER- AS A MEMBER SANTIAGO SEES ME- DISCUSSED THE RENDERING FACILITIES SO THEY TAKE RAW ANIMAL PARKS. AND THEY PROCESS THEM IT'S THE SMELL BASICALLY OF A ROTTING CORPSE SPREADING A CAR ACROSS NOT JUST ONE TOWN BUT IT ALMOST OF THE REGION- AND IT COULD IMPACT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AND THAT'S JUST TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT'S IT NO MATTER THE SIZE OF IT AND SO- WE VIEW THAT AS AS BEING A SERIOUS PROBLEM- AND THIS BILL WILL IMPACT PENALTY LIMITS FOR OTHER KINDS OF FACILITIES AS WELL OIL AND GAS- CONSTRUCTION SITES. LANDFILLS POWER PLANTS TO NAME A FEW AND AS WE ALL KNOW MANY OF THESE FACILITIES ARE LOCATED IN SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES- AND I THINK I WOULD BE REMISS WITHOUT NOTING. THAT THIS BILL WILL NOT IMPACT SMALL BUSINESS AND SO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE ALREADY INCLUDES- SEVERAL FACTORS THAT HAVE TO BE- EVALUATED WHEN IN DETERMINING PENALTIES ONE OF THEM IS BASICALLY THE ABILITY TO PAY. THE FINANCIAL BURDEN ON THE VIOLATING A COMPANY AND THAT WILL NOT BE CHANGED HERE SO A SOUTH COAST IT CAN BE WOULD ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. WITH THIS IMPORTANT BILL- THAT WILL HELP DETER AIR QUALITY VESTED VIOLATIONS AND PROTECT THE COMMUNITIES WE ALL SERVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON A NEW COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON NICOLAS SANCHEZ ON BEHALF OF THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT JUST ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ANY THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MAY HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WE DON'T HAVE ANY WITNESSES REGISTERED IN OPPOSITION SO WE'LL GO AHEAD AND TAKE ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. OR OPPOSITION OF AB TWENTY NINE TEN WILL START IN THE HEARING ROOM. ALLEN AB TO THE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS CLIFF MORNING I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL FOR ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMIC BALANCE WE DID SUBMIT A LETTER TO THE COMMITTEE AND TO THE AUTHOR AND WE WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT WE DO UNDERSTAND AND THE REFERENCE TO THE- OF- TO THE SERVER TYPE REFINERIES THE RENDERING FACILITIES THAT. REFERENCED IN THE COMMISSION HOUSES THAT TRULY THAT CAN BE A AN ENORMOUS PROBLEM. THE BILL. TO ALL THE FACILITIES AND THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE TO DRAW OUR OPPOSITION BUT WE'D BE HAPPY TO HAVE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS FOR. FOCUSING ON THOSE TYPES OF FACILITIES OF ASK THE IMMEDIATE PRIORITY AND THEN ALSO AS IT RELATES TO THE FINES AND PENALTIES. IT'S A UNDER MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE PENALTIES WILL INCREASE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS THAT'S INDEXED TO INFLATION. REGARD ANYWAYS AND SO THERE WILL BE A CONSTANT. UPGRADING ON AN ANNUAL BASIS OF THE FINES AND PENALTIES SO WE WANT TO PUT THAT AND KEEP THAT IN MIND BUT OBVIOUSLY THE RENDERING FACILITIES OF THAT'S FIRST AND FOREMOST. WE'D LOVE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THAT WITH THE AUTHOR. BUT CURRENTLY WE HAVE TO REQUEST AND NO VOTE. OKAY OF. UP CAN YOU PLEASE OPEN UP THE LINES FOR ADDITIONAL WITNESSES AND SUPPORTER OPPOSITION OF AB TWENTY NINE TEN OPPOSITION PRESS ONE THEN ZERO ON YOUR TOUCH TONE PHONE AT THIS TIME. WE'LL GO FIRST TO LINE EIGHTEEN. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS BY NAME APART BUT- THE- GATEKEEPER OF EUROPE EIGHTY NINE POINT ZERO BUT WE- PERRANCE THE BILL BLACK BASS A PANEL FONG IN THE- BURKE THE BY MAKE THE- WE AGREED THAT INCREASE. PENALTY ABOUT CRITICAL USE ME SADLY YOU WE'RE JUST TAKING OF YOUR POSITION ON THE BILL NAY MORGUE AND POSITION ON THE BILL. THANK YOU. BOB THANK. BY TWENTY NINE GO AHEAD. HELLO THIS IS SCOTT KING WROTE HIM AGAIN FROM PALO ALTO ON SUPPORTER AB TWENTY NINE TEN THANK. BOETTICHER WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS BRINGING THIS AND WHILE THE RENDERING PLANTS- WERE PART OF THE MOTIVATION I KNOW IT'S NOT THE ONLY MOTIVATION BUT I DO APPRECIATE THAT. THAT WORK IN THAT WORD GOING WIDER THAN JUST THOSE ON THE SPENDING PLANS JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE TAKING ALL THE COOL ALL OF THE AMENDMENTS IN THE ANALYSIS. YES I THINK THE CHAIR AND I WAS STILL TALKING ABOUT- IN TERMS OF HOW THE FUNDS ARE GONNA BE USE THAT THAT THEY ARE- TARGETING. A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT THAT WE AGREED ON CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT PIECE THE LANGUAGE. SUCH AS WE START AB EIGHTEEN NINETY SEVEN AND TWENTY NINE TEN AND WE'VE GOT SIMILAR SESSIONS ON A FEW ITEMS. MY TIME HERE ABOUT YOU SEEN THE DOLLARS AND THE AFFECTED COMMUNITY. ALMOST ALWAYS IT'S- IT'S AN R. DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND SO. I DO APPRECIATE THAT COMMITTEES- ATTENTION TO THAT ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THAT AND JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE BEING CONSISTENT ACROSS ACROSS THE BILL SINCE I DO APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE TAKING THE MOMENTUM THAT LANGUAGE AND- NAME ADDRESS. AND I DON'T MOVE THE BILL. ANY OTHER. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MISTER MURATSUCHI. COULD COULD YOU CLARIFY FOR ME- WHEN THE STRICT LIABILITY ATTACHED IS WHAT WHAT WHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON SCENARIOS FOR STRICT LIABILITY. GOT THANK YOU TYPICALLY THAT'S WHEN THERE'S AN ADMINISTRATIVE TYPE OF FINE SO YOU MISTER REPORTING A SOURCE TEST- SO MIDDLE OF A REPORT- THAT'S AT THE LOWER LEVELS ON AND YOU AND YOU ONLY GET TO THE SECOND PHASE OF THE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. IF YOU CAN'T SHOW THAT IT WAS SOMETHING BY- YOU KNOW HONEST MISTAKE OR OTHERWISE- SO THERE'S TYPICALLY AN EMISSIONS VIOLATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT WHERE THERE'S A RELEASE OR SOMETHING FROM A FACILITY AND WE CAN MEASURE AND QUANTIFY THE EMISSIONS- WE WILL GO TO THE SECOND TIER OF THE- STRUCK LIABILITY WHICH WOULD BE IN THE TEN THOUSAND RANGE- BUT THAT'S THE MOST COMMON VIOLATION BECAUSE YOU KNOW BUSINESSES ARE NOT OUT THERE INTENTIONALLY. COMMITTING ENVIRONMENTAL CRIMES OR BY MIDDLE OF VIOLATIONS AND SO THAT'S WHY WE STICK UP OF THE BOTTOM LEVEL- YOU KNOW REASONS OF AND SUCH LIKE IN HYPERION- THEY HAD SOMETHING WHERE THERE WAS A AN OVERFLOW TO THE SYSTEM AND SO THAT RESULTED IN FORTY ONE DAYS. OF VIOLATION BUT IT WAS NOT SOMETHING WHERE THE OPERATOR INTENTIONALLY YOU KNOW WASN'T MAINTAINING THE SYSTEM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND SO THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU'RE TALKING SAMPLE LIKE THAT. FORTY ONE DAYS OF VIOLATION MAYBE YOU GET TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WE DON'T FEEL THAT THAT'S REFLECTIVE OF THE TYPE OF IMPACT THAT WOULD HAVE LIKE ON THE NEARBY CITY LIKE ALSO. SO IF THERE WAS LIKE A- A SMALLER OPERATION LIKE. YOU KNOW NOT A REFINERY BUT- YOU KNOW THEY THEY THEY THEY WOULD BE POTENTIALLY HELD LIABLE FOR SOME OF THESE INCREASE STRICT LIABILITY PENALTIES KNOW WHAT OF TERRENCE HAD REFERENCE UNDER SECTION FOUR TWO FOUR THREE OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE THE LEGISLATURE IDENTIFIES EIGHT FACTORS AT ALL THE ARE DISTRICTS POSTED TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATIONS IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DRY CLEANER AND GAS STATION. ABILITY TO PAY IS ONE OF THOSE FACTORS SO THAT'S ONE THAT- WHEN WE ENGAGE WITH NEGOTIATIONS WITH THESE FACILITIES THEY PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION AND WE MITIGATE THE PENALTY THAT'S REFLECTIVE OF THEIR THEIR ABILITY TO PAY A FINE OKAY AND- HOPEFULLY BY FRIENDS AT THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT HASN'T. FORGOTTEN THE ONGOING ISSUE OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID AT THE TORRANCE REFINERY THERE IF THERE ARE UNPERMITTED EMISSIONS LEAK LEAK IS OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID AT THE TORRANCE REFINERY WOULD THAT WOULD THEY BE SUBJECT TO THE STRICT LIABILITY HELLO YES AND YOU YOU BRING UP A GOOD EXAMPLE THAT'S ONE OF THE CASES THAT I WOULD RELATE TO THE MEMBERS THAT WE DO THE SOUTH BECAUSE HE CAN HE DOES REACT TO WHEN THERE'S A VIOLATION IN THAT CASE. IT WAS A FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS SETTLEMENT TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION WENT TO THE IN THE USED WE CREATED A FUN AND THAT WAS USED TO CREATE FENCE LINE MONITORING AT THE FACILITY SO ON OUR OWN WE UNDERSTAND THE CHARGE THAT THE ASSEMBLY EXPECTS OF US IN RE PURPOSING THAT MONEY BACK FOR THE COMMUNITY AND WE BELIEVE WE DEFINITELY DELIVERED IN. THAT CASE OKAY THANK YOU. ANY OTHER. OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. OKAY ARE YOU KNOW THANK YOU MR SANTIAGO FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- YOU KNOW THANK YOU FOR ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS- WE JUST HEARD A BILL BY MISS WICKS- WHERE SHE ALSO ACCEPTED SIMILAR AMENDMENTS PROPOSING THAT THESE PET THE FUNDS FROM THE PENALTIES- ARE USED ARE YOU KNOW ARE VESTED IN THE COMMUNITIES AFFECTED I THINK IT'S VERY UNLIKELY- THAT THIS WOULD HAPPEN IN A COMMUNITY THAT DOESN'T NEED IT. AND I KNOW THAT IS YOUR CONCERN- WE WILL REVIEW THE LANGUAGE AND WORK IT OUT IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE- BUT I WANT TO BE CLEAR- THAT. JUST LIKE THE OTHER BILL I FEEL THAT THESE FUNDS THE PROCEEDS SHOULD BE USED- TO INVEST IN THESE TO MITIGATE- YOU KNOW THE AIR POLLUTION. IN IN THESE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY WHATEVER VIOLATION A MAY BE- IT THE FUNDS WILL NOT BE USED FOR GENERAL OPERATIONS OR- ANYTHING ELSE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT SOUTH COAST- YOU KNOW MAYBE IS NOT STRUCTURE. TO DO THIS BUT I THINK THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO FINALLY DO THIS- JUST LIKE THE BAY AREA AQ M. D. HAS ACCEPTED TO DO THIS I JUST FEEL THAT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY- IN THE LAST BILLS A REPRESENTATIVE FROM SOUTH COAST A. Q. M. D. CAME UP- TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. AND AT ON IN SUPPORT AND SO I THINK. THEY SHOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS FOR THEIR OWN AGENCY ARE AND SO I JUST WANT THAT TO BE CLEAR- THAT WE'RE NOT. WE'RE NOT GOING TO CHANGE THE LANGUAGE- TWO OF YOU KNOW GET A Q. AND D. TEND NOT INVEST IN THE AFFECTED COMMUNITIES. MERS FONG PLEASE GO AHEAD NOT AND I THINK YOU AND I SHARE THE SHARE I THINK THE CONVERSATION IN TERMS OF TRYING TO STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE FOR THE BILL IS TO HAVE MOST THE MONIES- IT AIMED AT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND WHEN WILL THEN JUST IT FOR IN OUR CONVERSATION JUST TO GET THE LANGUAGE RIGHT SO THERE MAY BE A SITUATION. WHERE THERE MAY BE A VIOLATION OR A SETTLEMENT IN AN AREA WHERE THAT THE AIR QUALITY VIOLATIONS HAVE BEEN MITIGATED IN THOSE DOLLARS WOULD BE IN EXCESS AND WE CAN RESTRUCTURE LAWMAKERS IN A WAY THAT THAT THAT GOES TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND HAS A LARGER IMPACT- BUT IN NO WAY. AND I SHARE THE SENTIMENT WITH YOU THAT IF THE DOLLARS ARE USED IN THIS I'M SORRY- IF THE VIOLATIONS COME UP IN A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY THAT THAT THE DOLLARS BE USED IN THAT. PARTICULAR AREA HOW 2% OKAY ALL. MR MERECE SHE HAS A COMMON THANK I ASK. OF A QUESTION I. AM NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE COMMITTEE AND THE AUTHOR- BUT- AS THE HEY KIM SOUTHCOAST A CANDY REPRESENTATIVE INDICATED. A PRIME EXAMPLE IS IN TORRANCE AND I'M NOT SURE F YOUR DISCUSSIONS. YOU KNOW IT WOULD INCLUDE A COMMUNITY LIKE TORRANCE IN A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY ALTHOUGH WE DO CLEARLY YOU KNOW ARE IMPACTED BY THE AIR POLLUTION- YOU KNOW. THAT THAT THAT WOULD BE AFFECTED BY THE VIOLATIONS SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT THAT THE THAT THE INTENT OF THE AMENDMENT IS TO. MITIGATE THE AIR POLLUTION IN THE IMPACTED COMMUNITY AND NOT NECESSARILY LIMITED TO LIKE LIKE A CALOMBARIS SCREEN OR OTHER DEFINITION OF A- VISIT THIS ADVANCE COMMUNITY YEAH THAT IS NOT THE INTENTION. RIGHT I BELIEVE WHAT MR SANTIAGO IS GOING FOR IS IF THE VIOLATION IS ALREADY BEEN MITIGATED IN THAT COMMUNITY- HE WOULD LIKE THE FUNDS THAN TO BE INVESTED IN A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY. RIGHT IF RIGHT NOT IF IT'S NOT IF THE COMMUNITY AFFECTED IS NOT DISADVANTAGED OKAY RIGHT NOW CORRECT ABSENT MEANT MANAGEMENT MENTAL HEALTH. NO ABSOLUTELY LOOK THE REALITIES IF THE END AND AT THE BEGINNING BUT LET'S JUST THE SPONSORS AND I KIND OF DEPEND ON THAT BUT WE'VE GOTTEN TO A POINT I THINK WE'RE GONNA BE OKAY- IF A COMMUNITY. HAS BEEN IMPACTED. YOU TO CLEAN UP THAT COMMUNITY NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. WHAT WHAT THE DOLLARS MITIGATED IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA WHETHER IT'S BY FINES OR BY SETTLEMENT BECAUSE OUR SETTLEMENT IN SOME CASES- THE CERTAINLY CAN BE MUCH HIGHER THAN THE FIND IN MANY CASES. IF THAT IF WHATEVER AREA HAS BEEN. CLEANED UP AND YOU CAN CORRECT ME MANAGER IF YOU THINK I MISUNDERSTOOD BUT I THINK WE'RE AIMING AT THE SAME THING. I HOPE THAT- IT. IF AN AREA IS ALREADY BEEN CLEANED UP LET'S SAY FOR EXAMPLE- SANTIAGO SOCIO TO OPEN UP. A SHOP IN PARTICULAR AREA. THEY HAVE POLLUTION THAT WE SETTLED OUT FOR TEN MILLION BUCKS OR WHATEVER IT IS. AND IT WAS ALREADY CLEAN. IF THERE'S EXTRA DOLLARS LEFT OVER WE WOULD WANT THEM TO GO TO A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY. SO THAT THERE'S THE FLEXIBILITY USED FOR THAT. LIKEWISE IF THOSE DOLLARS- ARE. EITHER FIND OR OR SETTLED- IN THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY THEY SHOULD STATE ISSUE CLEAN UP THAT THAT POLLUTION I DON'T WANT THOSE DOLLARS TO LEAVE FROM ANY PARTICULAR AREA THAT IS DISADVANTAGED. ANYMORE THAN I WOULD WANT THEM TO LEAVE FROM THE AREA- THAT THAT THAT I REPRESENT- IT WAS JUST A WAY TO SAY. IT THERE- LET'S LAWLER THEY COULD USE THE MORE TOWARD THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES I THINK THAT'S- THAT THAT'S WHAT WE WERE AIMING AT IN TERMS OF FLEXIBILITY. I THINK. YOU'RE OKAY WITH THAT I THINK SO. OKAY OKAY WELL- I THINK ANY OTHER. COMMENTS QUESTIONS OKAY DO WE HAVE A MOTION ON THIS I THINK WE HAVE A MOTION BY MISS GARCIA WE NEED A SECOND.
