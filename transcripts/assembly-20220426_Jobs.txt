THANK I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY EIGHT SEVENTY THREE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUPPLIER DIVERSITY ACT CALIFORNIA'S MAKES SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS INTO AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN RECENT YEARS UNFORTUNATELY THESE RESOURCES HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY LIMITED TO DEVELOPERS THAT DO NOT ALWAYS REFLECT. OUR STATE'S RICH RACIAL AND ETHNIC DIVERSITY AT THE STAND THE INDUSTRY BY AND LARGE HAS NOT MADE A CONSCIOUS EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT MORE DIVERSE AND WOMEN OWNED FIRMS HAVE ACCESS TO DEVELOPMENT RELATED CONTRACTS. IT IS TIME THE INDUSTRY COMES TOGETHER TO CREATE SHARED GOALS AND METRICS THAT CENTER ON RACE EQUITY AND INCLUSION WHILE TRYING TO OVERCOME THE ONGOING HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA. AB TWENTY EIGHT SEVENTY THREE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE CALIFORNIA TOWARD GREATER DIVERSITY BIKE REQUIRING HOUSING SPONSORS THAT RECEIVE AN ALLOCATION OF LOW INCOME TAX CREDITS. FOR THE CALIFORNIA TAX CREDIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE D. C. A. C. REPORT ON THE USE OF WOMEN MINORITY DISABLED VETERAN AND L. G. B. T. Q. BUSINESS ENTERPRISES. THIS BILL ALSO REQUIRES THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS CREATE AND SHARE A DETAILED AND VERIFIABLE PLAN TO INCREASE DIVERSE PROCUREMENT THROUGH AN ANNUAL REPORT TO THIS BODY AND THE PUBLIC. LONG TERM GOALS FOR ACHIEVING MORE DIVERSITY AMONG THE BUSINESSES THEY CONTRACT WITH MEMBERS THIS BILL IS ABOUT CREATING AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES WHO NEED IT MOST. BY DIVERSE FIRMS THAT ARE MORE LIKELY TO TAKE A PEOPLE CENTERED APPROACH THAT I FOR HOW PROJECTS CAN BENEFIT IN UP LIFT TO SURROUND UNITY.

HOWEVER BUSINESSES OWNED BY PEOPLE OF COLOR AND OTHER MINORITIES HAVE NOT SHARED IN THESE DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES AT A RATE EQUIVALENT TO OUR STATE'S RICH DIVERSITY OVER THE YEARS THIS HAS LED TO DIVERSE FIRMS LOSING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN POTENTIAL CONTRA. THE RIVERS MISSED OUT AN OPPORTUNITY TO EARN BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN WEALTH AND THOUSANDS OF LIFE CHANGING JOBS IF THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY WAS AS DIVERSE AS CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION COMMUNITIES OF COLOR COULD EXPECT APPROXIMATELY THIRTY TWO POINT FOUR BILLION IN PAYROLL INVESTMENTS ALONE.
