MY NAME IS PAT BOYD I'M A RETIRED TEACHER WITH THE CALIFORNIA RETIRED TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. I RETIRED FROM THE REAL LINDA SCHOOL DISTRICT IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE. ENJOYING THE CALIFORNIA STATE TEACHERS RETIREMENT SYSTEM AFTER A TOTAL OF THIRTY EIGHT YEARS OF WORKING WITH CHILDREN IN KINDERGARTEN AND FIRST GRADE. SPENDING TIME WORKING WITH THE YOUNGEST LEARNERS WAS SO FULFILLING AND GAVE ME A SENSE OF PURPOSE I LOVED EVERY MINUTE. AS A RETIREE I ENJOY WORKING WITH OTHER RETIREES AND VOLUNTEERING IN MY COMMUNITY THROUGH KELLER TA. AS I GROW OLDER I'VE SEEN CALIFORNIA CHANGE MY COMMUNITY IS CHANGING THE STATUS CHANGING THE WORLD IS CHANGING THESE CHANGES HAVE IMPACTED THE FUTURE. THAT I HAVE PLANNED FOR RETIREMENT ALLOWANCE WILL PROVIDE ME BOTH NOW AND IN THE UNCERTAIN FUTURE. AS A RETIRED TEACHER I CERTAINLY DIDN'T ENTER THIS PROFESSION TO BECOME WEALTHY. BUT THE FACT THAT I HAVE A LITTLE CERTAINTY OF PURCHASING POWER. THROUGH THE CAL STIRS SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFIT MAINTENANCE ACCOUNT GIVES ME A SENSE OF SECURITY THAT I WILL BE PROTECTED FROM INFLATION WHICH IS TAKING MORE AND MORE OF MY INCOME. SB EIGHT SIX EIGHT WILL PROVIDE RETIREES LIKE ME. WITH A LITTLE RETIREMENT SECURITY BY INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF PURCHASING POWER THAT WE RECEIVE BASED ON WHEN WE RETIRE. FOR THE OLDEST OF US. 80% OF WHOM ARE WOMEN. WE COULD RECEIVE UP COULD MEAN WE WON'T HAVE TO STRUGGLE AS MUCH TO DECIDE WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO SPEND OUR INCOME ON MEDICATION RENT OR OTHER ESSENTIALS. JUST THIS YEAR MY MEDICARE COSTS WENT UP BY FOURTEEN POINT 9% HOW AM I ON A FIXED INCOME COUPLED WITH HAVING MY HARD EARNED SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS ELIMINATED. BY THE SOCIAL SECURITY OFFSETS SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD THESE COSTS HELP RETIREES LIKE ME HAVE A LITTLE MORE PEACE OF MIND AND MORE FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE SO THAT WE WON'T HAVE TO RELY ON OUR FAMILIES TO GET BY.

THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING DILIGENTLY WITH MY STAFF SPONSORS ON THIS BILL. TODAY I'M PRESENTING SP ONE THOUSAND TWO WHICH LOOKS TO ADDRESS THE SHORTAGE OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IN THE WORKERS COMP SYSTEM THIS BILL WILL ALLOW LICENSED CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKERS LCSW TO BE ADDED TO OUR STATE'S WORKERS COMPENSATION MEDICAL PROVIDER NETWORK. THE US IS FACING A MENTAL AND BEHAVIOR HEALTH CRISIS ESPECIALLY AMONGST FRONTLINE WORKERS. LIKE FIRST RESPONDERS HEALTH PROFESSIONALS GROCERY STORE EMPLOYEES AND OTHER ESSENTIAL WORKERS THIS CRISIS WAS EXACERBATED BY THE STRESSES OF HOPE IN NINETEEN OTHER STATES LIKE TEXAS AND NEW YORK HAVE MOBILIZED THEIR LCSW IS TO HELP FILL THE NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIANS. ACCORDING TO THE WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE RATING BUREAU THERE APPROXIMATELY SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS FILED EACH YEAR HOWEVER CALIFORNIA HAS ONLY SIXTEEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED LICENSED PSYCHOLOGIST AND FIVE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR PSYCHIATRISTS IN THE ENTIRE STATE. CLEARLY THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TO ADDRESS THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS IN INJURED WORKERS BY INCLUDING LCS W'S IN THE- M. P. PROVIDER LISTINGS- THE NETWORK ACCESS CAN BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE UP TO TWENTY NINE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX LCSW C. TO HELP MEET THE NEEDS.

AND I AM BILL JUST TELL YOU OFFHANDEDLY FROM MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THAT WE HAVE STRUGGLED AS A NETWORK PROVIDER TO GET THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS INTO OUR NETWORKS TO HELP INJURED WORKERS- I'M NORMALLY ONE WOULD THINK IF ONE WAS ON THE PAYER SIDE OR THE INSURANCE SIDE THAT. I WOULD STAND UP HERE AND SAY OH WE'RE OPPOSED TO ANYTHING THAT'S GOING TO COST MOM BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE I THINK WE HAVE NEARLY UNANIMOUS SUPPORT I THINK THE SENATOR CONVENTION ON THAT AS WELL- BECAUSE WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A SEVERE SHORTAGE OF MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS. AND THAT'S OF COURSE TRUE COMMERCIAL HEALTH BUT IT'S PARTICULARLY PERTINENT FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION- MY COLLEAGUE WHO'S GONNA SPEAK AND FROM A CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE IN A MORE MOMENT CAN TALK ABOUT THIS BUT- I'M PARTICULARLY FOR OUR FIRST RESPONDERS PERSONAL THAT HAVE WORKED IN HOSPITALS. PEOPLE THAT ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE PANDEMIC- HAS RESULTED IN AN EXPLOSION OF MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS THAT WE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE I'M FROM A NETWORK PERSPECTIVE AND OF COURSE OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO GET THESE FOLKS TO HELP THAT THEY NEED TO GET THEM RETURNED TO WORK AS- QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE- THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW US. TO UPDATE AN ANTIQUATED SECTION OF THE LABOR CODE THAT PREVENTS US FROM USING LICENSED CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKERS. AS PROVIDE TYPES. WORKS IT'S SORT OF A GLITCH IN THE LAW- AT THE TIME THAT THIS WAS WRITTEN IT WAS NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT AND OUR PROVIDER DEMANDS HAVE CHANGED DOWN THE PROVIDER TYPES OF SHIFTED. AND THIS IS SORT OF ALLOWING US AS A NETWORK TO KEEP UP WITH WHERE COMMERCIAL HEALTH IS- WHERE BEARS ARE THAT ARE IN THE NON COMP WORKER'S COMPENSATION SECTOR IT'S ADDRESS SO IT ALLOWS US TO.

WELCOME IN THE HE MAY PRESENT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS. SB ELEVEN SIXTY TWO ADDRESSES AN ISSUE THAT IS AFFECTING WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR ACROSS THE STATE THE GENDER AND RACE PAY GAP ACCORDING TO RECENT ANALYSIS OF PAY DATA CALIFORNIA WOMEN IN TWENTY TWENTY LOST FORTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS DUE TO THE GENDER PAY GAP. AND PEOPLE OF COLOR IN THE STATE LOST SIXTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS TO THE RACE PAY GAP. THE WAGE GAP PERSISTS ACROSS INDUSTRIES OCCUPATIONS AND EDUCATION LEVELS AND EXACTS A HEAVY TOLL NOT ONLY ON WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR BUT ALSO ON THE FAMILIES THE SUPPORT. AND THE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE. OVER THE COURSE OF A FORTY YEAR CAREER A WOMAN BEGINNING HER CAREER TODAY TYPICALLY STANDS TO LOSE OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO THE WAGE GAP. WOMEN OF COLOR STAND TO LOSE THE MOST WITH BLACK AND NATIVE WOMEN NATIVE AMERICAN WOMEN LOSING NEARLY NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND LATINAS LOSING OF ONE POINT ONE MILLION OVER THEIR LIFETIMES THE WAGE GAP AS COMPARED TO WHITE NON HISPANIC MEN. HE TRANSPARENCY IS KEY TO ACHIEVING PAY EQUITY. SB ELEVEN SIXTY TO THE PAY TRANSPARENCY FOR PAY EQUITY ACT WILL HELP IDENTIFY THE GENDER AND RACE BASED HE DISPARITIES BY REQUIRING FEE TRANSPARENCY AT EVERY STAGE OF EMPLOYMENT PROCESS. FROM HIRING PROMOTION AND ONGOING EMPLOYMENT. SPECIFICALLY SB ELEVEN SIXTY TWO WILL HELP NARROW THE WAGE GAP BY REQUIRING THE DISCLOSURE OF SALARY RANGES ON ALL JOB POSTINGS. AND MAKE AN EMPLOYER FOR INTERNAL PROMOTION OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE TO CURRENT EMPLOYEES. INCLUDING THE MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM SALARIES AND JOB POSTING PROVIDES JOB SEEKERS WITH THE INFORMATION NEEDED TO NEGOTIATE FAIR SALARIES AND HELP BUSINESS. BUSINESSES EFFICIENT EFFICIENTLY HIRE AND RETAIN THE BEST TALENT THAT MATCHES THEIR NEEDS. SB ELEVEN SIXTY TWO ALSO REQUIRES COMPANIES TO PUBLICLY REPORT PD THAT BROKEN DOWN BY RACE ETHNICITY AND SEX FOR BOTH DIRECT EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEES HIRED THROUGH A THIRD PARTY STAFFING AGENCY. MANY MAJOR COMPANIES ARE ALREADY DISCLOSING THEIR FEDERAL PAY DATA REPORT AS PART OF THEIR COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION INITIATIVES AND RACIAL JUSTICE INCLUDING HALF OF THE TOP ONE HUNDRED PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES IN THE UNITED STATES. P. EXCLUDING HALF OF THE TOP ONE HUNDRED PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES IN THE UNITED STATES ALREADY DISCLOSED THE STATE UP PUBLICLY. ENSURING EUAL PAY IS NOT ONLY CRITICAL FOR WOMEN AND THEIR FAMILIES BUT ALSO BENEFITS EMPLOYERS. EQUITABLE EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES INCLUDING PREVENTING AND ADDRESSING PAY DISPARITIES CAN COME FOR A WIDE RANGE OF BENEFITS ON A COMPANY INCLUDING ACCESS TO THE BEST TALENT INCREASED EMPLOYEE SATISFACTION AND PRODUCTIVITY. WE MUST INCREASE PAY TRANSPARENCY IN ORDER TO NARROW THE GENDER AND RACIAL WAGE GAP WHICH PREVENTS WOMEN PARTICULARLY WOMEN OF COLOR FROM ACHIEVING ECONOMIC SECURITY I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION WITH THE OPPOSITION A HOW TO TAKE MEANINGFUL STEPS TO NARROW THE GENDER AND RACIAL PAY GAP. TO DATE WE HAVE JUST NEKRON AND HANNAH HOLLOWAY THE TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU SENATOR OF WILL GO AHEAD IN FIRST. CALL ON I HAVE- JUST IN THE GROUND AS THE SECOND LEAD WITNESS- HELLO% THIS CORRECTLY TRY CALLING ON HIM THE WHOLE WAY. SHE'S HERE. GREAT YES. GOOD AFTERNOON MR JERRY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ALSO THANK YOU DODD SENATOR THEM I'M FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. ON THIS ISSUE. I'M HANNAH HOLLOWAY WITH TECH EQUITY COLLABORATIVE A PROBLEM FOR THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. AS A SENATOR OUTLINES THE BILL BEFORE YOU REQUIRES EMPLOYERS DISCLOSE PROMOTION OPPORTUNITIES TO CURRENT EMPLOYEES AS WELL AS PAY SCALES AND JOB POSTINGS IT ALSO INCLUDES TEMPORARY WORKERS AND PAID OUT OF REPORTS. TRANSPARENCY IS GOOD FOR WORKERS THE STUDY'S FINDING THAT WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE MORE WILLING TO NEGOTIATE AND MORE SUCCESSFUL IN DOING SO. WHEN THE PARAMETERS FOR NEGOTIATIONSARE CLEARLY OUTLINED. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THAT'S GOOD POLICY FOR COMPANIES TO. ADDRESS CAPITAL CITY FOUND THAT COMPANIES THAT PUBLICLY. RELEASED THEIR PAY DATA INFORMATION. FORM HERE'S ON THE STOCK BUT TWO POINT FOUR. FOLLOWING SOME CLAIM YOU MIGHT ABOUT TRANSPARENCY EFFORTS HAMPER ACT ECONOMIC GROWTH OR BUSINESS COMPETITIVENESS. THERE ARE ARGUMENTS FROM A POSITION OF TRANSPARENCY HURTS BUSINESSES BY INVITING LAWSUITS. THE BILL DOES ADDRESSES CONCERNS BUT LIMITING THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION TO ONLY AGGRIEVED PARTIES AND ALSO REQUIRING ONLY ADVOCATE PAID OFF. WHICH CANNOT BE THE BASIS FOR INDIVIDUAL EQUAL PAY CLAIMS. THE RESEARCHERS ALSO DOESN'T SUPPORT THE FLOWS TO CLEAN. THE STUDIES ON THE EFFECT OF THE PUBLICLY START HAS ENDURING PAY DISPARITIES ATTRIBUTED PROGRESS NOT TO LAWSUITS BUT TO VOLUNTARY CORPORATE PRACTICE CHANGE. SO COMPANIES CAN AVOID LIABILITY BY PROACTIVELY FIXING. GAPS UNDER TO BE ABLE TO. WE JUSTIFIED FACTOR. AND IN THE SUN. INSTANCES OF IN. THESE SYSTEMIC FIXES RATHER THAN RELYING ON OUR CURRENT SYSTEM OF INDIVIDUAL COURT CASES TO FIX THE ISSUE. THE EVIDENCE TRANSPARENCY CAN HELP PREVENT LAWSUITS FACT THAT COMPANIES MIGHT BE. SUSCEPTIBLE TO SUSCEPTIBLE TO. IN THE LAST ELEMENT OF THIS BILL HIS INCLUSION STAFFING AGENCY WORKERS IN THE EXISTING CALIFORNIA PAID OUT OF REPORTS- THESE WORKERS ARE SIGNIFICANT AND GROWING PART OF THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT HAS INCREASED 75% SINCE THE GREAT RECESSION COMPARED TO JUST 19% OF THAT TOTAL. ACCORDING TO PROTECT HIS OWN RESEARCH THESE WORKERS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY LIKELY TO BE WOMEN NON BINARY AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND EARNED A FRACTION OF THE PAY AS DIRECT WORKERS EVEN WHEN PERFORMING SIMILAR ROLES. THE STAFFING INDUSTRY HOWEVER HAS LOBBIED FOR EXEMPTIONS TO NEARLY ALL PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY AND REPORTING SO WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THIS INDUSTRY GROWTH IS COMING FROM OR THE FULL EXTENT OF THE DISPARITIES WITHIN IT. SUCH A SIGNIFICANT SUBGROUP OF CALIFORNIA WORKERS SHOULD BE REFLECTED IN STATE OVERSIGHT. I DON'T JUST CLOSE BY SAYING THAT THIS BILL MEARS CALIFORNIA PAID ON A REPORTS. AND THE FEDERAL EEO ONE. THE DECISION OF PAY DATA TO THOSE YEAR ONES WAS APPROVED AFTER AN ESTIMATED BURDEN TO EMPLOYERS WAS FOUND TO BE MINIMAL- WHICH WILL ALSO BE FOR THE LARGE EMPLOYERS LIKE THOSE COVERED IN THIS BILL. SB ELEVEN SIXTY TWO. SIMPLY EXPANDS ON EXISTING BEST PRACTICES TO THE BENEFIT OF ALL CALIFORNIA WORKERS I RESPECTFULLY HER DRIVE OFF. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TESTIMONY JUST LIKE RON IS SUPPOSED TO BE ON THE LINE THE MODERATORS LINE ARE YOU THERE. YEAH ARE YOU MAY PROCEED WITH YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU.

WHAT I AND OTHERS EXPERIENCE. THAT RIGHT AND SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN. WHEN I WORKED THERE I FOUND OUT THE PERSON WHO ROLE I PACKED BILLS HAVE BEEN PAID. THREE HI MORE THAN MORE FOR THE SAME JOB. IT WAS IN THE FACE WHEN I WOULD THEN ASK THE TRAIN AND MENTOR THE MAN WHO GOT A PROMOTION THAT HAD BEEN PROMISED ME. WHEN I STARTED ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT MY K. COMPARED TO THE PAY OF MYSELF HERE'S IT NEARLY BROKE ME WHEN I WAS TOLD IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS. THAT I HAD NO BIG LOSS ASKING TO BE PAID AT THAT LEVEL. LIKE MANY WOMEN I'M TIRED OF PROVING MYSELF IN THE WORKPLACE BEING TRUSTEDWITH MORE RESPONSIBILITY AND EARNING POSITIONS OF LEADERSHIP. ONLY TO BE FEATURED ISLAND THE SUBJECT TO PAY COMES UP AND IN SOME CASES OUTRIGHT. HELLO HEY TRANSPARENCY IS VITAL TO MAKE SURE MARGINALIZED WORKERS ARE EXPLOITED. IF WE'RE UNAWARE OF THE INEQUALITY IS IMPACTING US WE CAN'T APPROPRIATELY ADVOCATE FOR OURSELVES. TRANSPARENCY KEEP LEADERSHIP ON THAT AND KEEP EMPLOYEES INFORMED EVERYONE WINS WHEN YOU VALUE YOUR TEAMS AND THEY CAN CLEARLY. SEE THAT THEY'RE BEING VALUE. HI OF THE SETTLEMENT ALSO.

THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN VERS TAKE ME UP ON BEHALF OF SEJAK ADDRESSING THE COMMITTE TODAY WAS SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPACT THIS BILL WOULD HAVE ON EMPLOYER LIABILITY IN CALIFORNIA. WILL BE ABSOLUTELY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WANTING TO HIGHLIGHT GENDER BASED WAGE GAPS SEJAK IS INCREDIBLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE EXPANDED AN ONEROUS LITIGATION THAT WOULD SURELY BE DIRECTED. AT EMPLOYERS OF FORCETO DEFEND THEMSELVES AGAINST MISLEADING WAGE DATA PUBLISHED ONLINE. DATA ALONE DOESN'T TELL THE WHOLE STORY OUT OF CONTEXT THERE ARE VALID AND LEGAL REASONS WHY PAY DISPARITIES EXIST. NONE OF WHICH WILL BE HIGHLIGHTED ALONGSIDE THE DATA UNDER THIS BILL CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES SHOULDN'T BE SUBJECT TO LAWSUITS REPUTATIONAL BACKLASH. FOR REASONABLE AND LEGAL PAY DIFFERENCES THAT EXIST IN THEIR WORK FORCE. COLLECTION OF THE STATE IS NOT THE CONCERN THE STATE ALREADY REQUIRES EMPLOYERS TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION THE CONCERT IS THE PUBLICATION. OF THE DATA- CREATING BASICALLY A SEARCHABLE A DIFFERENT DATABASE ONLINE FOR PLAINTIFFS TO USE TO SOON PLAYERS. ONCE THIS TYPE OF DATA IS MADE PUBLIC ALL OF PLAINTIFF ATTORNEY WOULD NEED TO DO A SEARCH THE COMPANIES. THE PERCEIVED PAY DIFFERENCES AND- STATE. OF DEMAND FOR A- FOR LITIGATION. IT'S WERE MENTION THAT THE ENABLING LEGISLATION THAT REQUIRES WAGE DATA COLLECTION SPECIFICALLY REJECTED THE IDEA OF MAKING THE DATA PUBLIC. FIVE YEARS AGO THE STATE HAD THE SAME CONVERSATION ABOUT PAY ONLINE DATA. THEN THE GOVERNOR BROWN WHO IS A LONG TIME CHAMPION OF PAY EQUITY I RECOGNIZE THE THREAT OF LITIGATION IS A SERIOUS ISSUE AND VETOED A BILL SIMILAR TO THIS ONE. NOTING IN HIS VETO MESSAGE THE WALL TRANSPARENCY IS A GREAT WAY TO IDENTIFY A PROBLEM PROVIDING DATA OUTSIDE OF CONTEXT CREATES AMBIGUITY. AND COULD BE EXPORTED TO ENCOURAGE MORE LITIGATION THAN PAY EQUITY. IN AN ARTICLE PUBLISHED SAY NEAR A PLAINTIFF ATTORNEY QUOTED AND PARAPHRASING HERE ABOUT PUBLISHING THIS TYPE OF DATA ONLINE IS THE GOVERNMENT BASICALLY GIVING UP PLAINTIFF ATTORNEYS THE DATA THEY NEED. TO GO OUT AND SEE COMPANIES. PUBLICIZING THE STATE WOULD PUT CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS IN A POSITION TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AGAINST MERITLESS LITIGATION WITHOUT THE ADDED BENEFIT OF IDENTIFYING INTENTIONAL WAGE GAPS. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THANKS. OKAY THANK YOU. THE NOW- ASHLEY HOPE ACTUALLY OFTEN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN OPPOSITION SB ELEVEN SIXTY TWO. WE HAVE TO THE CONCERNS OF MISS HELP REGARDING PART ONE OF THE BILL SOMEONE LIMIT MY TESTIMONY TO PARTS TWO AND THREE- PRESENTLY- THE LEGISLATURE HAS RECENTLY ENACTED LEGISLATION SAYING THAT YOU CANNOT RELY ON SALARY INFORMATION YOU CAN ASK AN APPLICANT FOR SALARY INFORMATION. YOU CANNOT PROHIBIT SOMEONE FROM ASKING ABOUT WAGES ARE TALKING ABOUT IN THE WORKPLACE AND AN APPLICANT MAY ASK FOR A PAY SCALE- AFTER THEY'VE GOTTEN THEIR FIRST ROUND INTERVIEW- AND SO WE HAVE SEVERAL CONCERNS IS MANDATING THE PAY SCALE TO BE ON EVERY SINGLE JOB POSTING. FIRST I WANT TO KNOW WHO IS GOING TO HAPPEN IS THAT EMPLOYERS ARE GOING TO BE FORCED TO PUT QUITE A LARGE RANGE ON THOSE JOB POSTINGS. THEY NEED FLEXIBILITY IN THEIR PAY SCALES I'M FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS WHETHER THAT'S TO BE ABLE TO LEARN TALENT TO FIT IF THEY CAN'T FIND AN APPLICATION WHO EXACTLY NEEDS OF QUALIFICATIONS THAT ARE LOOKING FOR. OR IF THERE ARE CHANGES IN JOB DUTIES SO WE ARE GOING TO GET ON THESE JOB POSTINGS IS NOT GOING TO BE SOMETHING OF THAT'S HELPFUL FOR THE WORKER. WHO ARE GOING TO BENEFIT IS THE BIG BUSINESSES BIG BUSINESSES THAT ARE TO BE ABLE TO PUT THESE REALLY STRIKING NUMBERS ON THERE THAT SMALL BUSINESSES AND MEDIUM AND LOCAL BUSINESSES ARE JUST NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO COMPETE WITH. LEASE NOW IF THEY HAVE AN INTERVIEW THEY CAN TALK TO THE APPLICANT OTHER BENEFITS WORK ENVIRONMENT WHAT HAVE YOU THEY'RE JUST SIMPLY NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO COMPETE ESPECIALLY IN TODAY'S LABOR SHORTAGE- MORE THEY'RE BARELY GETTING APPLICANTS TO BEGIN WITH. PART THREE OF THE BILL REQUIRES DOESN'T NOTIFY EVERY SINGLE EMPLOYEE OF NOT ONLY ANY OPEN JOB VACANCY BUT IN ANTICIPATED JOB VACANCY. SO IS THIS COMMITTEES ANALYSIS NOTES AND THAT'S GONNA END UP ITH A LOT OF PROBABLY POTENTIALLY HUNDREDS AND SOME BIG COMPANIES NOTIFICATIONS CONSISTENTLY GOING OUT TO PLEASE WHICH IS NOT EXACTLY THE BEST USE OF RESOURCES. AND FINALLY ARE CONCERNED WITH A PROVISION IS REALLY FLEXIBILITY PEOPLE LEAVE ALL THE TIME WITHOUT NOTICE OR THEY'RE TERMINATED. YOU CONSIDER RESTAURANT RIGHT YOU HAVE A HEAD CHEF WHO OFTEN MIGHT LEAVE TO GO START THEIR OWN RESTAURANT OR WHAT HAVE YOU. AND YOU CAN'T SIMPLY THEN JUST PROMOTE THE DEPUTY THE SECOND IN COMMAND AT TO DO DINNER SERVICE AT NIGHT UNDER THIS BILL. THAT'S OUT. FOR YOU WOULD HAVE TO- THAT HAS. UP TO EVERYONE IN THAT RESTAURANT EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT QUALIFIED OR THEY HAVE NO INTEREST BEFORE YOU COULD EVEN TEMPORARILY PROMOTE SOMEONE. UP TO THE NEXT POSITION. AND ANY MISSTEP HERE SUBJECT YOU TO A PRN PAGO IN CONTRARY TO WHAT WAS STATED BEFORE. IT'S NOT ACTUALLY LIMITED TO PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR GRIEVED. UNDER PAR THAT ANY PERSON CAN SUE FOR ANY TECHNICAL VIOLATION OF THE LABOR CODE THERE'S CASE LAW ON THAT. YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE HARMED YOU COULD HAVE A PAGA PLAINTIFFS WHO HAD NO INTENTION OF EVER APPLYING FOR ANY OF THESE JOBS. SERVICE PLAINTIFF ON BEHALF OF AN ENTIRE CLASS. THE FOR THESE OTHER REASONS WE ARE URGING NO VOTE. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE- WE WILL NOW. ASK TO SEE WHEN THE COMMITTEE ROOM WHO WISH TO EXPRESS IN OPPOSE POSITION OTHER THAN THE ME WITNESSES. IF SO PLEASE COME FORWARD.

FOR A PAUSE ON DIVESTMENT FOR SPECIFIED UNFORESEEABLE EVENTS WOULD REQUIRE THE BOARDS OF CALPERS AND CAL STIRS TO PRODUCE AN ANALYSIS ON HOW RAPIDLY PENSION FUNDS. CAN REDUCE THEIR DEPENDENCE ON FOSSIL FUELS. MEMBERS I'M HERE TODAY- ONCE AGAIN TO PRESENT SB ELEVEN SEVENTY THREE WHICH WILL AND THE USE OF PUBLIC EMPLOYEES HARD EARNED PENSIONS THE FINANCE FOSSIL FUELS. SB ELEVEN SEVENTY THREE- IS NOT JUST A POLITICAL STATEMENT IT IS THE CREATION FROM YEARS AND YEARS OF ADVOCACY BY TEACHERS FACULTY MEMBERS AND STATE EMPLOYEES. HAVE DEMANDED THAT THE BOARDS OF CALPERS AND STIRS THIS CONTINUE INVESTING NEARLY TEN BILLION DOLLARS OF THEIR HARD EARNED PENSIONS TO FINANCE THE VERY INDUSTRY. RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION FEDERATION OF TEACHERS ALONG WITH LOCAL CHAPTERS OF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. REPRESENT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PERSONS THERE'S MEMBERS SUPPORT THIS BILL AND ONCE THE LEGISLATURE TO ACT NOW ESPECIALLY AFTER TODAY. AFTER THE IPCC THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL POLICY AND CLIMATE CHANGE JUST TODAY ANNOUNCED THAT IN THE NEXT THIRTY MONTHS NOT THIRTY YEARS. THIRTY MONTHS WE WILL SEE THE WORST IMPACTS AND CLIMATE CHANGE IF IMMEDIATE CUTS. IN EMISSIONS IN ALL SECTORS ARE NOT DONE. THERE IS PRECEDENT GLOBALLY WE'VE SEEN OVER THIRTY NINE TRILLION DOLLARS INVESTED WITH HUNDREDS OF PENSION PORTFOLIOS. TAKING ACTION BUT NOT JUST SETTING THAT ZERO GOAL BUT BY PER. DIVEST HERE IN CAL. THIS YEAR USES IN THE UC HAVE CONFIDENTLY AND PROACTIVELY REMOVE FOSSIL FUEL INVESTMENTS OUT OF THEIR PORTFOLIOS. THE UC'S INFECTIOUS THING OVER A BILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENTS IN TWENTY TWENTY INTO NEW.

IT IS NOT ENOUGH IN FACT MANY OF THE FOSSIL FUEL COMPANIES PER- THE CLIMATE ACTION ONE HUNDRED WEBSITE FOUNDED BY CALPERS INVESTORS. ARE NOT EVEN HITTING THEIR OWN NET ZERO- FOR- GIGI REMISSIONS REDUCTIONS BY TWENTY FIFTY SO-WHY WOULD WE BE INVESTING IN THEM. AND WHY WOULD THE INVESTMENTS GO. OF THAT. REDUCE EVEN FURTHER THAN A TWENTY FOUR BELOW TWENTY FIFTY A LEVELS. OPPONENTS ARGUE THOUGH THAT FUNDS WILL FACING NEGATIVE FINANCIAL IMPACT IF WE DIVEST AND- TO THE CONTRARY IN FACT. INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FIRMS IN STUDIES HAVE CONCLUDED THAT MOVING AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS ACTUALLY IMPROVE NOT WEAKENS INVESTMENT RETURNS. AND WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE OF FOSSIL FUEL SECTOR. HAS A DIMINISH PRESENCE IN THE S. AND P. FIVE HUNDRED AND ESG AND FOSSIL FUEL. OF BUZZELL FEEL FREE INDEXES ARE BEATING THE S. AND P. FIVE HUNDRED. AND APPROVING TO BE A RISKY INVESTMENT FOR CUTS PUBLIC EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT FEATURES THAT IS ALSO FEELS THAT IS.

THIS IS ON JUST NUMBER GOAL BUT THAT THE INTENTION HERE IS TO ENSURE THAT WE MINIMIZE RISK OF UNDERPERFORMING FOSSIL FUELS AND MAXIMIZE RETURN WITH CLEAN INVESTMENTS WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY TAKING A STAND ON CLIMATE CHANGE.

DESPITE RECENT HIGHER OIL PRICES AND A SPIKE IN STOCK VALUES THE LONG TERM OUTLOOK IS NOT POSITIVE. OIL AND GAS COMPANIES ARE USING CURRENT CASH SURPLUSES TO PAY DIVIDENDS AND REDUCE THAT. AS OF MARCH TWENTY TWENTY SOME ELEVEN HUNDRED INVESTMENT FUNDS OF DIFFERING SIZE AND VARYING MISSIONS OF THE VESTED IN SOME FORM. BLACKROCK UNDER CONTRACT WITH THE CITY OF NEW YORK CONDUCTED A SURVEY OF INSTITUTIONAL FUNDS THAT DECIDED TO DIVEST OF THOSE FUNDS THAT EXPLICITLY MEASURE DIRECT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE NO INVESTORS FOUND SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE PERFORMANCE. BUT RATHER HAVE REPORTED NEUTRAL TO POSITIVE RESULTS. THE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY BLACKROCK HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT THEY ARE NOT ADVOCATES OF DIVESTMENT. HOWEVER WHEN A CLIENT POSED THE QUESTION TO BLACKROCK THE COMPANY PROVIDED FIFTY SHIRLEY FOUND EVIDENCE THAT A FUND COULD ELIMINATE FOSSIL FUEL INVESTMENTS FROM A PORTFOLIO AND STILL MEET FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE TARGETS. DIVESTING FROM FOSSIL FUELS IS A DICE DEFENSIVE MEASURE DESIGNED TO PROTECT INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS FROM THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CLIMATE CHANGE. BLACKROCK AND OTHER INVESTMENT HOUSES I FOUND THAT MOST FOSSIL FUEL COMPANIES ARE NOT PREPARED TO HANDLE THE PHYSICAL AND TRANSITION RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXTRACTION AND SELLING OF FOSSIL FUELS. MOST INVESTMENT STRATEGIES ALSO DEVISE AN ON RAMP SO THAT COMPANIES WITH WELL THOUGHT OUT STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE CAN BE HELD IN PORTFOLIOS THAT OTHERWISE THAT ARE OTHERWISE THE VESTING FROM FOSSIL FUELS. FOSSIL FUEL COMPANIES WERE ONCE MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS THE INSTITUTIONAL FUNDS. AND TO THE WORLD ECONOMY TODAY THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS UNSTABLE AND THE OUTLOOK IS NEGATIVE FOR THOSE WITHOUT SOUND STRATEGIES TO COPE WITH CLIMATE CHANGE THANKS. Q.

THANK YOU FORTY NINE YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD- COMMITTEE MEMBERS RICK SMILES THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DISTRICT COUNCIL MEMBERS NOTHING HAPPENED A DENTURE CAL POLY STAND WITH THE BUILDING TRADES IN OPPOSITION OF AT THE ELEVEN SEVENTY THREE. AT THIS TIME WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS IN OPPOSITION OF SB ELEVEN SEVENTY THREE. FLORIDA THANK YOU MODERATOR AND WILL COME BACK NOW TO THE COMMITTEE AND LOOK FOR COMMITTEE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. HI ANYBODY WISH WE RECOGNIZE OUR VOICES HERE TO A VOTE. RIGHT AS A NEW MEMBER I. IT'S VERY HARD TO HEAR SO MANY GOOD INTENDED BILLS- AND I'M BEING TO EXPRESS MY CONCERNS THAT I HAVE RIGHT NOW WHICH HAVE BALANCED AND WHEN I THINK ABOUT- BILLS AND I TRIED TO REALLY THINK THROUGH THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT COME FROM. AT WHAT IT CALLED WARM HEARTED AND GOOD INTENDED BILLS SOMEONE IT JUST BEGAN BY EXPRESSING WHAT I'VE LEARNED THIS PAST YEAR- WITH REGARD TO THE OIL INDUSTRY AND- THE ENVIRONMENT. ONE I'VE LEARNED THAT- CALIFORNIA ONLY PRODUCES OF ABOUT30% OF THE OIL THAT WE UTILIZE IN THE STATE IN THAT WE IMPORT ABOUT 70% OF THE OIL WHICH AS YOU CAN IMAGINE WE IMPORTED FROM AREAS THAT DON'T HAVE THE SAME STANDARDS- ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICE THAT WE HAVE SO. LET ME JUST BEGIN BY THAT- LET ME ALSO STATE THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA. IS THE LEADING STATE WHEN IT COMES TO ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS LABOR LAWS GENDER LAWS. AND EVERY OTHER LAW YOU CAN THINK OF CALIFORNIANS LEADS THE WAY SO IF WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE- AT MARKET EVERYWHERE WE CAN PRODUCE MANUFACTURE DISTRIBUTE. OIL IT WOULD BE US SO I'M A LITTLE BIT QUITE FRANKLY DISTURBING THE FACT THAT WE WOULD TRUST OTHER COUNTRIES TO PRODUCE THE OIL THAT WE UTILIZE IN CALIFORNIA- THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME STANDARDS THAT WE DO AND BY. BASICALLY CLOSING OUR EYES AND SAYING OKAY AS LONG AS WE DON'T SEE HOW THEY DO THAT THINGS WERE GOING TO TAKE THEIR OIL I THINK WE HAVE A PROBLEM. SO THAT'S NUMBER TWO NUMBER THREE THE OTHER CONCERN THAT I HAVE WITH THIS WITH THIS BILL- BUYS THAT DIVESTMENT OF IT IS THAT THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF CURBING INNOVATION- TOWARDS LOW IN ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE MANY OF THESE COMPANIES ARE ALSO TRYING TO- ARE HAVE SHOWN AN EFFORT. IN TRYING TO LEAD THE- BASICALLY THE EFFORT OF TRYING TO FIND NEW WAYS OF UTILIZING TECHNOLOGY- THAT IS ZERO AND LOW EMISSION. NUMBER FOUR- SOMETHING THAT I HEARD I HEARD TODAY AND THAT'S THE- THE UNINTENDED. THE CIVILIZATION OF THE LOCAL WORKFORCE THAT WHAT HAPPENED- WITH THE DIVESTMENT- THAT WOULD OCCUR- WITH REGARDS TO OUR LOCAL MARKETS BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE THAT 30% OF THAT WORLD IT'S BEING MANUFACTURED MOVES TO REACH YOUR LOCALLYSO THAT'S ANOTHER CONCERN THAT I WOULD HAVE. IN THE AREA- SO. I AM ONCE AGAIN GOING BACK TO CALIFORNIA BEING THE LEADER IN ENVIRONMENTAL LABOR GENDER IN EVERY SINGLE OTHER- FIELD WHEN IT COMES TO LAWS WE HAVE IT HERE. SO IF I WOULD TRUST IN AND I'M NOT SURE WHETHER OR NOT THE BILL ADDRESSES THAT I WAS TRYING TO REACH HERE IN THE NIGHT THE ANALYSIS AND I COULDN'T FIND IT SO. I'M NOT SURE IF I OVERLOOKED IT BUT IT DIDN'T SPECIFY WHETHER OR NOT YOU WERE REFERRING TO DIVESTMENT OF OIL COMPANIES HERE IN THE U. S. AND- INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES OR IS IT JUST INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES THAT YOU WANT TO DIVEST FROM- SO THAT'S- I'M NOT SURE IF YOU OUT INTO THE CHAIR AT THE TIME. WHEN YOU KNOW WHEN THE TIME COMES I WOULD LOVE TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THAT WOULD BE OUT- SOMETHING THAT I MISSED HERE SOMEWHERE BUT- TO ME- THOSE ARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE WITH THIS BILL- THAT I FEEL. ARE PROBABLY NOT SOMETHING. I CAN'T SUPPORT IT TODAY- AND- I HOPE THAT I'VE MADE CLEAR AS TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE WITH REGARD TO THIS BILL. THAT WHOLEHEARTEDLY WELL INTENDED. THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES I THINK IN THE LONG TERM AND CURRENTLY WITH THAT WOULD NEED TO HAVE THE PRODUCTION OF OIL- WITH REGARDS TO I SEE. NEEDY NOT OIL IN CALIFORNIA AND- CURBING THE ABILITY TO DO THAT FOR COMPANIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA WOULD BE A HUGE CONCERN SO- THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU MEMBERS SURE OTHERS- CENTER NEWMAN. THANK YOU MISTER SO I'M SORRY YOUR DOLLARS YOU YOU AND I'VE SPOKEN WITH THE BILL I MEAN I'M I'M VERY CONFLICTED- AS I'VE PURPOSE BUT AS A MATTER POLICY RIGHT AND I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE ON THE PURPOSE OF THE BROADER IMPERATIVE TO DECARBONISE. BUT WITH RESPECT TO THE POLICY DID IT'S YOU KNOW THERE'S TWO COMPONENTS IS A MORAL ARGUMENT- THERE'S A FIDUCIARY I'VE BEEN OUT ON THE ON THE MORAL ARGUMENT. YEAH- PART OF MY CONCERNS ARE DEFINITIONAL SO GET BUDGET QUESTIONS SO. YOU KNOW THIS IS BASED ON THE DEFINITION OF FOSSIL FUEL COMPANIES IT'S PROBABLY WORTH NOTING THAT NONE OF THESE COMPANIES RECALL THEMSELVES FOSSIL FUEL COMES THIS POINT SO YOU KNOW WITH RESPECT TO THAT. HOW DO WE ACCOUNT FOR A COMPANY THAT HOLDS SUBSTANTIAL CARBON ASSETS- BUT IS AT THE SAME TIME MAKING MATERIAL INVESTMENTS- IN ALTERNATIVE FUEL TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS REMOTE RENEWABLE HYDROGEN OR OTHER ACTIVITIES CALIFORNIA THAT DOES THE BILL MAKING ALLOWANCE FOR THAT OR COULD IT. SO THROUGH THE CHAIR THANK YOU- THANK YOU SENATOR NEWMAN FOR A QUESTION SO. TO SORT OF ADDRESS WHAT YOU'RE REFERENCING AS WELL AS AS UNDER A CHOI BOGUE IS WE'RE LOOKING AT THE C. THE CARBON UNDERGROUND TWO HUNDRED THIS IS A LIST. OF THE LARGEST OIL GAS RESERVES THAT HAVE A SPECIFIC CARBON INTENSITY THAT IS SO HIGH- THAT UP AGAIN DRITTEN DETRIMENT TARDE BARNETT. AND SO WE'RE JUST LOOKING AT THOSE TWO HUNDRED COMPANIES WHICH IS BASED OFF OF WHAT OTHER- THE VESTMENT POLICIES HAVE DONE THE C. S. USE THE UC'S ETCETERA. AND SO IT DOESN'T TAKE IN ACCOUNT WE HAVE AS A AS A LEGISLATURE OUR PURVIEW IS JUST TO LOOK AT DIVESTMENT WE CAN'T- ADDRESS. WE CAN'T WITHIN OUR PURVIEW TELL THE- CALPERS MISTERS BOARD- WHAT TO INVEST IN NECESSARILY BUT IT DOESN'T PRECLUDE THE INVESTMENTS FOR CLIMATE SAFE- I'M SORRY MAYBE THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M ASKING WHAT WHAT I'M WHAT I'M ASKING ABOUT IS. THERE MAY BE COMPANIES WITHIN THOSE TWO HUNDRED THAT HOLD CARBON ASSETS BUT AT THE SAME TIME DOING RESEARCH MAKING INVESTMENTS IN ALTERNATIVE FUELS FEARS. THAT WE SHOULD WELCOME RIGHT AND SO IS IT FAIR TO INCLUDE THEM AS A MATTER AS A DEFINITION OR SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY HOLD ASSETS RIGHT SO YOU KNOW A BUNCH OF BIG ENERGY COMPANIES APPROACH AT THAT DESCRIPTION. INCLUDING CHEVRON FOR INSTANCE- WILLING SEPARATE FROM THIS BILL THANK YOU SIR EVEN SEPARATE FROM THIS BILL. THE CALPERS AND STIRS BOARD HAS TAKEN A POSITION ON NET ZERO GHG EMISSIONS BY TWENTY FIFTY. WHICH IS THE PARA CLIMATE OF PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT AS WELL SO BASED OFF OF THAT EVEN LOOKING AT THAT. ON THEIR CLIMATE ACTION ONE HUNDRED WEBSITE WHERE THEY LIST ALL THE COMPANIES IN THAT CARBON UNDERGROUND IF YOU LOOK UP THE EXXON OR CHEVRON THEY'RE NOT EVEN HITTING THOSETWENTY FIFTY. MARKS A REGARDLESS OF THE INNOVATIONS THEY'RE NOT EVEN HITTING THEIR OWN STANDARDS THAT. CALPERS AND SERVICES AS PUT FORWARD. YEAH WHAT DO WE ACCOUNT FOR. THEY'RE NOT EVEN HEADING INTERIM SAID TO THIRTY TWO THIRTY FIVE WHICH IS THE TYPICAL. GOAL FOR CALIFORNIA STAND. YOU DO I THANK THAT'S AFFECT OF THAT BRINGS ME TO THE SECOND. COMPONENT WHICH IS THE FIDUCIARY MAIN SHOW IT SO I WANT HIM WE'VE HEARD ARGUMENTS FROM FOLKS IN SUPPORT. THAT HAVE SAID FAIRLY CLEARLY THAT THIS IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE ENVIRONMENT NUMBER OF ISSUE WITH THAT BUT ALSO WITH RESPECT TO THE INVESTMENT. PORTFOLIOS OF CALPERS CLUSTERS BUT WE'VE ALSO HEARD FROM MISS. MARTINEZ WITH THAT THEY DISAGREE SO IT SHOW HOW. WITH RESPECT TO. YOU KNOW THE FIDUCIARY PLEASE- YOU KNOW WHAT HOW DO I SQUARE THAT WHERE IT WHERE IT SEEMS REASONABLE TO ME TO ASSUME- THE INVESTMENT MANAGERS AT BOTH FUNDS ARE ACTUALLY ALREADY DOING. THEIR VERY BEST- IN LIGHT OF THE FUTURE RESPONSIBILITY. AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER THE NEWMAN I'LL GO BACK INTO THE TWENTY FIFTY GOALS WERE NOT EVEN HITTING THOSE PEOPLE CAN'T WAIT THIRTY YEARS AS A MENTION. THE IPCC CAME OUT TODAY WITH A REPORT OF OVER A HUNDRED SCIENTISTS THAT SAID WITH THIRTY MONTHS. TO FIGURE THIS OUT. THE THIRTY YEARS IS TOO LONG- FOR ONE NUMBER TWO BY THE CALPERS OWN FIVE YEAR DIVESTMENT REVIEW. WHICH I HAVE WHICH IS ONLINE FOR. THE ACTUALLY ANALYZE THE FIVE CURRENT INVESTMENT POLICIES THAT FOR LIKE THE VESTING FROM SADDAM SIX THE DAY LESSON FROM TOBACCO. THE VESTING FROM COAL. ALL FIVE OF THOSE IN WHAT IT MENTIONS HERE'S LEGISLATIVE MANDATES OT JUST READING OFF OF THIS. CALPERS CANNOT THIS IS JUST FOR IRAN DIVESTMENT. HELPERS CANNOT DEMONSTRATE HOW THIS DIVESTMENT DISADVANTAGES THE FUND AND THE ANY FEASIBLE INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES WOULD YIELD. A LOWER RETURN RATE OF RETURN. TO BUY THEIR OWN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT. IS FIVE THE BEST POLICY. DON'T REALLY. LOWER RATES OF RETURN. I I'M NOT SURE THAT IS THEIR ONLY DOLLARS IT'S A GOOD COULD I ASK MISS MARTINEZ WAY TO TESTIFIED IN A POSITION FOR HER RESPONSE TO THE- YOU MAY HAVE MISSED MARTINEZ WEIGHT IS STILL AVAILABLE AND I HAVE DONE IT BY NOW. THE NEW MAN- I BELIEVE THAT'S A- BUT AS HELPERS REPORT SO FORTUNATELY CAN'T BECAUSE THAT IS I'M WITH CHARACTERS. FROM OUR DIVESTMENTS WE DO SEE A REDUCTION IN OUR FIND OF THAT THE COMPOUNDED COSTS- FOR ALL OF OUR DIVESTMENTS TO DATE WHETHER MANDATED OR ON THE BOARD HAVING VOTED ON THE MEASURE. A COST OF NEARLY NINE BILLION DOLLARS. IT'S OF A IF I ASK YOU MENTION IN YOUR TESTIMONY MS MARTINEZ WOULD. CARBON RELATED METRICS- SO YOU KNOW AGAIN IN IN KEEPING WITH YOUR PRODUCERS POSSIBILITY HOW ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT COURTLY METRICS SPECIALLY AS DISTINCT FROM THIS BILL. VERY GOOD QUESTION SENATOR WE'RE WORKING WITH OTHERS WHO ARE ARE. TRYING TO GET THOSE MEASUREMENTS TOGETHER RIGHT NOW THERE ARE A LOT OF APPLES TO ORANGES COMPARISONS ARE NOT THERE'S NOT CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE INDUSTRY AND THE HAPPY WITH SCOPE ONE SCOPE TWO AND SCOPE THREE EMISSIONS. AND SO WE'RE LOOKING TO HAVE THOSE MEASUREMENTS BE CONSISTENT ACROSS THE INDUSTRY SO THAT A HOLISTIC ANALYSIS CAN BE DONE TO DETERMINE HOW TO REDUCE EMISSIONS AND IN A ONE PIECE OF ACTION IS HAPPENING ON THAT IS THAT THE SEC AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. WHEN THERE ARE TRYING TO GET THAT CONSISTENT MEASUREMENT OUT THERE NOT FOR EXAMPLE. AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND SO. SOMEBODY I THINK IT WAS THE TREASURE'S OFFICE MENTIONED. THAT THE FIDUCIARY GUARDRAILS THAT ARE NOW INCLUDING THE BILL IS THAT A REFERENCE- TO I GUESS TO THE CHAIRPERSON EXHAUSTED TO THE NEW AMENDMENTS. THE MOST RECENT QUARTER AMENITIES OR SOMETHING ELSE. I BELIEVE SO BUT DO TRAFFIC LIGHT TO FOCUS ON AS WELL. THERE IS THERE EXISTING. IN THE BILL- PRIOR TO THE AMENDMENTS HAD BEEN ACCEPTED BY THE AUTHOR TODAY- THAT- THAT REQUIRED DEFERENCE TO THE PRODUCE FIDUCIARY. DUTY OF THE- OF THE OF THE FUNDS M. IF THERE'S BEEN FURTHER CLARIFIED IN THE AMENDMENTS- CLARIFY THAT FOR YOU KNOW IT'S VERY URGENT TO QUESTIONS WITH RESPECT TO EACH ONE FOR EACH OF THE MEMBERS SO. ON THE FIRST AMENDMENT- YOU THAT TALKS ABOUT FORCE MAJEURE- AND NOW THAT THAT IS PART OF THE BILL. HOW DOES THAT AFFECT. THE FUNDS MOVING FORWARD IS THE REASON WAS CENSORSHIP GIVEN CUT THE UKRAINE SITUATION THAT THAT. THAT CIRCUMSTANCES IN AFFECTING OUR WILL BE AT THE TIME OF SHELTERING THE THAT THE BILL PASSES. WE THINK YOU OF THE CENTER WAS TALKING ABOUT EARLIER IS THAT YOU KNOW BASED ON ON THE. ADVICE OF THIS COMMITTEE- WE AS ALLEGES- CAN I. DICTATE TO THE PENSION FUNDS- HOW DO THIS WITH WE CAN DIVE WE CAN ASK HIM TO DIVERSE ACTUALLY WE CAN DICTATE TO THEM TODAY BECAUSE- WE CAN'T TELL THEM HOW TO INVEST SO. THE AMENDMENTS CALL FOR. DO CREATE A KIND OF FORCE MAJEURE CLAUSE THAT ALLOWS YOU KNOW THE FUNDS TO SUSPEND THE REQUIREMENT- BASED ON. THEIR FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY TO REACT. UP TO IDENTIFY AND REACT TO THE TYPICAL KINDS OF- CIRCUMSTANCES THAT YOU SEE IN IN THAT KIND OF FORCE MAJEURE CLAUSE ACT OF GOD WAR UNFORESEEABLE. EVENT CREATES CONDITIONS THAT. THE IMPACT NORMAL MARKET MECHANISMS. WHAT IS SAYS IS SO INEFFECTIVE INFECTED WITH READING THROUGH IS THAT. ONCE THAT DETERMINATION HAS THEN BEEN RELAXED BY THAT SEEM MORE NOW BY THE LEGISLATURE- THEY HAVE- A ROLE% TO BE SHORT PERIOD OF TIME- CALLED OUT IN IN THE AMENDMENTS IN IN THE IN THE IN THE BILL LANGUAGE AS IT. IS IT WOULD NOW STAND- TO BEGIN REINVESTING AGAIN- HOWEVER NOTED THAT GOES BEYOND TWENTY THIRTY FIVE WHICH WAS JUST A TIED TO. A SUMMER CLIMATE GOALS AS YOU KNOW THAT BECAUSE EITHER THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE SIX AT THE SECTOR BRANCH LEGISLATURE IS ALREADY PUT IN PLACE. AND I DON'T THINK THAT I WOULD THAT BE THE SUNSET IF YOU'D LIKE US TO MAKE SENSE BUT I I'M STILL UNCLEAR AS TO WHETHER OR NOT- THESE CONDITIONS WOULD APPLY NOW DID THIS IS A MATTER OF SEVEN ASSERTION BY THE FUNDS THEMSELVES. SO THAT THAT DEMOCRATS SUGGEST MISS. MARTINEZ WAITED YOU KNOW TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS A YOU KNOW A GLOBAL CONFLICT GOING ON WHICH IS HAVING A MEANINGFUL IMPACT. ON ENERGY PRICES IN THAT MARKET HE WOULD WITH THAT APPLY NOW. WITH THAT BE A GOOD BASIS FOR SUSPENDING- YOUNG. LIQUIDATION DIVESTMENT ON THE BASIS. THANK YOU CENTER I CAN'T TO THE EXACT. BUT WE ARE. SCANNING THE PORT FOR RISK ALL THE TIME WE HAVE. TO FIVE RE FACTOR THE WE ARE LOOK AT- AND OUR INVESTMENT MANAGERS ARE MAKING DECISIONS BASED ON THAT SO SOMETHING RISES TO A LEVEL THAT IT WILL HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE FUNDS THEY DO TAKE ACTION OF THEIR INTERNAL BUSINESS AFTER THEY WORK WITH OUR EXTERNAL MANAGERS. OF EXAMPLE OF THAT IS WITH THE RUSSIAN INVASION OF UKRAINE. THAT TRIGGERED ARE RISK FACTORS RELATED TO WAR AND VIOLENCE AND SO THERE WERE ACTIONS THAT WERE TAKEN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. FROM LATE FEBRUARY TO EARLY MARCH THAT REDUCED OUR DIRECT INVESTMENTS IN RUSSIA. I APPRECIATE THAT AND SO IT'S ON THE ON THE SECOND. AMENDMENT IT IT IT REQUIRES AN ANALYSIS METHODS OPPORTUNITIES- YOU KNOW SO AS TO MAKE A SMART TRANSITION AND ACTUALLY WITH A PARTICULAR ON ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. ABOUT FORTY BOTH RETIREMENT FUNDS AND THE NET EMPLOYMENT EARNINGS OF STATE WORKFORCE. AND SO EACH OF THESE ARE RELATIVELY NEW MEMBERS SO I WANT TO SEND STAND THEM. TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS IS NOW INCLUDED. WOULD WOULD THE CONDUCT OF THAT ANALYSIS BE A SUFFICIENT TO HOLD IN ABEYANCE. YOU KNOW DIVESTMENTS OF SUCH TIME IS AN ANALYSIS IS COMPLETED THIS IS A TEACHER BECAUSE- COMMITTEE. DRAFTED A MEMBER'S HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED- THAT IS PART OF A SECTION OF THE BILL THAT REQUIRES A REPORT TO COME BACK ANNUALLY TO THE LEGISLATURE WHICH WITHIN T. UP- SO TO SPEAK THOSE THOSE ISSUES SO. IT WOULD IT WOULD ALLOW THIS DEBATE TO CONTINUE ON INTO THE DELIBERATIONS AND DEBATE THAT WE'RE HEARING TODAY ON ON AN ANNUAL ASIS OF COURSE- IN IN CERTAINLY IT WOULD BRING THAT INFORMATION FORWARD TO THE LEGISLATURE WANT TO STEP IN. AND MODIFY THIS APPROACH OF WORKFORCES IS STRUGGLING WE JUST GOT THAT FROM THE FIRST ANNUAL REPORT- NET IMPLEMENTER RESERVE DROPPED OFF THE TABLE AND- THESE OTHER CIRCUM THERE'S THE TRANSITION- WHAT WE'RE GETTING FROM THE ANNUAL REPORT IS THAT OPPORTUNITIES ROUGHLY EFFECTIVELY. A REDUCE FOSSIL FUELS AND TRANSITION ARE NOT AVAILABLE IF THAT WAS IN THE REPORT THE I THINK THE IDEA IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD THEN. ACT BY BRINGING FORWARD A SUBSEQUENT BILL. OKAY BUT BUT BUT BUT DID NOT OF THIS WOULD WOULD SLOW DOWN OR OTHERWISE INTERFERE WITH INVESTMENT PROCESS IS CALLED UPON. NOT THE BILL NOT OTHERWISE EXCEPT FOR THE EXERCISE OF THE BOARD'S FIDUCIARY. DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES SO THEY THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THAT ANALYSIS THEMSELVES- TO THE EXTENT THAT. THIS OF. COURSE MEASURE LANGUAGE EARLY IS IN EFFECT- IF HEY'RE IF THEY'RE CONTINUING ON THEIR MERRY WAY- THEY HAVE TO AT LEAST. A DISCLOSING TO CLEAR WHAT'S GOING ON THIS ANNUAL REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE SO THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER ACTION I SAW IT SO I GUESS I MEAN. MIGHT BE CONFUSING- ASSIST WITHOUT THEIR MERRY WAY IS THE BILL'S PRESCRIBED WAY. BABY FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND FROM TESTIMONIES. THERE THERE. CURRENT INCLUDE IS TO DO A SIR WAY OUR FIRST IF THIS PASSES TO DO IT ANOTHER WAY RIGHT AND SO THE ANALYSIS. MAKES PERMISSIVE. THERE OBSERVE ADDITION ALICE'S INACTION OR DOES IT SIMPLY. KOREANA STRIP COMBINE THESE TWO THINGS SERVICES TWO TRACKS LATER IN THE DAY WOULD THEY WOULD STILL I ASSUME- BE REQUIRED BY LEGISLATION TO DIVEST SO WHAT WHAT IS WHAT IS THE ANALYSIS TO BY WAY OF. SLOWING THAT DOWN OR NOT- THE I THINK THE BILL'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT DIVESTMENT HAS TO OCCUR BETWEEN JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN- FIRST. THOUGH I THINK THIS FIRST PART OF THE ANSWER- HOWEVER THE BILL. HAS VERY CLEAR LANGUAGE- THAT WITH DEFERENCE TOWARDS THE PENSION FUNDS OWN FIDUCIARY DUTY RESPONSIBILITY AND IN IN THE CASE OF THE LEGISLATURE HAS NO THERE'S NOTHING IN THE BILL OR FOR THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT- TO ENCROACH UPON THEIR FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY SO HOW THEY INVEST. FUNDAMENTALLY COMES DOWN TO IT THEY'RE ON THE SAME DAY MISTER CHAIRS WELL TO ADD YOU KNOW SOLD ON THAT- THESE ARE YOUR AMENDMENTS NAY APPRECIATE THEM I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND UNION MEMBERS THAT CALLED FOR THIS DIVESTMENT BILL. ARE ALSO ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY AS WELL I THINK THAT'S ALSO PART OF THIS- YOU KNOW FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND PART OF THIS AND I KNOW THAT- YOU KNOW. FOR SOME TIME CALPERS AND CAL STIRS HAVE RELIED ON ONE TYPE OF POLICY WHICH IS ENGAGEMENT POLICY WITH BIG OIL WHICH IS FINE. WE HAVE TO BE AT THE TABLE IF THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO DO THAT'S GREAT TO BE ABLE TO PUSH FORWARD. YOU KNOW AN AGENDA OF NET ZERO AT BY TWENTY FIFTY OR TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. BUT IT SHOULDN'T TAKE OFF THE TABLE DIVESTMENT AS WELL WHICH IS PROVEN TO BE- TO BE. A GOOD RETURN ON INVESTMENT FOR MEMBERS OVERALL SO THAT ANY AND AGAINST THAT SENATORS I WAS I REALLY DO APPRECIATE WHERE WERE YOU IN CENTER WE'RE TRYING TO HEAR- BUT THERE'S NOTHING PREVENTING EITHER THESE FUNDS FROM DIVESTING NOW SO WHAT WE'RE DOING IS. WE'RE GIVEN VERY CLEAR GUIDANCE THAT THAT IS IN FACT WHAT THEY'RE LEGALLY REQUIRED TO DO. AND YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YOU YOU MENTIONED- UNION MEMBERS AND AGAIN I DO APPRECIATE AND I'VE HEARD FROM LOTS OF. THAT BUT WE HAVE ALSO HEARD FROM MANY IN OPPOSITION TODAY AND I HAPPEN TO KNOW. A FAIR NUMBER OF THESE FOLKS DID YOU KNOW MANY OF WHOM WERE FOR THE BUILDING TRADES- ARE THEMSELVES. ENVIRONMENTALISTS WHO ARE THEMSELVES. FULLY COMMITTED TO DECARBONISING CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY ECONOMY. BUT IT IS THEIR VERY STRONG OPINION THAT THIS WILL HAVE A- AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON ON THEIR WORKING CONDITIONS AND SO. HOW DO WE RECONCILE THAT BACK TO THIS BILL WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DIVESTMENT. YOU TO BE ABLE TO DIVEST ON THEIR OWN HOWEVER IF YOU LOOK ON THEIR WEBSITE THEY HAVE A CLEAR POLICY THAT ALREADY SET DEEMS DIVESTMENT AS A AS A RISK WHEN WE KNOW IT'S REALLY NOT THAT ALREADY DEEMS IT- IN A NEGATIVE LIGHT IN MY OPINION AND SO WHAT I'M SAYING WITH THIS IS THAT WE HAVE TO DO THIS BECAUSE ALL THEY WANTED TO DO IS ENGAGE WITH. AND SIT DOWN AT THE TABLE WITH EXAM WHICH IS FINE YOU SIT ON THE TABLE WITH EXXON MOBIL TO GET THREE MORE ENVIRONMENT ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY BOARD MEMBERS TO A TWELVE MEMBER BOARD THAT'S GREAT THAT'S NOT A QUORUM NUMBER TWO IT'S STILL NOT MOVING OF THE NEEDLE FAST ENOUGH FOR WHERE WE NEED TO GO GIVEN YOU KNOW WHERE WE ARE CURRENTLY. SO AGAIN THIS IS NOT LOOKING AT NECESSARILY THE WORK FORCE AND WHAT THIS WILL DO THIS IS SIMPLY A DIVESTMENT BILL THAT WILL LOOK AT ENSURING THAT IF WE ARE DIVESTING IN THIS MOVES FORWARD THAT THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT THE CALPERS AND STIRS BOARD WOULD THEN START SHIFTING MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY SET FRIENDLY- INVESTMENTS BUT ALSO LABOR FRIENDLY COME COMPANIES AS WELL AS- ERIN LEHANE ALLUDED TO THE ESG. RISK PORTFOLIO IS WHAT WE WANT TO OUR ESG MORE- MORE ESG INVESTMENT IS WHAT WE WANT TO BE GEARED TOWARDS NOT JUST THE ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND BUT ALSO SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE ARE THEY PROTECTING LGBTQ EMPLOYEES DO THEY HAVE GOOD GOVERNANCE AND TRANSPARENCY CLASSES LIKE WHAT WHAT ELSE CAN WE INVEST AND THAT'S NOT JUST ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY BUT THE WHOLE PORTFOLIO OF SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENTS- WHICH- IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING AND THEY ARE YOU KNOW DOING SOME WORK BUT I THINK THEY NEED TO GO FARTHER IN ORDER FOR US TO HIT OUR GOALS. AND THAT IS I THINK THAT IS THAT IS A- YEAH. DIæN SO I GUESS IT DID PROBABLY PREVENT MISLED. ONLY SHE CAN RESPOND. FROM MISS LANE ARE YOU BUILD STILL. SOME AYE SHE WAS STRUGGLING WITH HER VOICE A LITTLE BIT. I'M HERE. DID YOU HEAR THE QUESTION ALL RIGHT. CAN YOU SAY IT ONE MORE TIME PUT OUT SO THAT I'M GONNA PARAPHRASE CENTER GONZALEZ'S ARGUMENT WHICH IS YOU KNOW THAT THAT THAT YOU AMONG OTHERS HAVE HAVE- SUPPORTED THROUGH THE GENERAL APPROACH TO ESG INVESTMENTS. BUT AS YOU KNOW WITH RESPECT TO THIS BILL- THE WHOLE VIEW AND MANY OF YOUR MEMBERS HAVE MADE THE EXPLICIT ARGUED THAT THIS BILL WILL HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE STATE'S WORKFORCE SO IF YOU COULD RESPOND. TO THE SENATOR'S ASSERTION THAT THAT YOU ARE SUPPORTIVE BUT MORE GENERALLY THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF THING WE SHOULD BE DOING. WHAT THE IMPORTANT THING IS WE CAN'T BE PICKING AND CHOOSING. RIGHT UNFORTUNATELY GOING TO. DIRECTION OF YOU KNOW OF. I'VE BEEN DRESSING AND ALL THE COMPANIES THAT WE USE CALIFORNIA'S SHARE VALUES WITH THE DEFENDER SAID YOU KNOW COMPANIES THAT THEY YOU KNOW OUR DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY OR WHAT HAVE YOU IF TO DO I HE. FEEL LIKE THIS IS WHAT'S TROUBLING. THE WORD. THE PENSION SYSTEMS LIKE WITHIN LIKE A HALF HERE WITHOUT FULLY LOOKING AT THIS IN A COMPREHENSIVE WAY. AND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE WHERE WE REALLY TAKE EXCEPTION. YOU KNOW WHAT A LOT OF THE DEVELOPMENT CONVERSATION THAT HAPPENS OVER THE YEARS- YOU DON'T I WANT TO BRING UP ANOTHER YOU KNOW THAT WE SHOULD NOT A BUILDING TRADE ISSUE BUT THE CALL TODAY FROM ISRAEL THAT HAPPENED YOU KNOW A COUPLE YEARS AGO IT WOULD BE GETTING A VERY MUCH A SELECTIVE CHOICE OF WHERE WE WANTED TO GET BACK. OUT BASED ON YOU KNOW. ARE LIVE OR NOT HE WOULD BE. MORE HELP IN THE JORDAN SO I THINK IT'S A PICK AND CHOOSE. ACTUALLY CONCERNING TO US BECAUSE THAT IS. YOU KNOW JUST BY THE NATURE DESTABILIZE. WE WILL MOVING TOGETHER. IN A MORE COMPREHENSIVE WAY IT WOULD BE LESS DE STABILIZING. AND MAKE MORE SENSIBLE PROBABLY OUR MEMBERS. WELL IF YOU DON'T ALL OF THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DEPENDING ON THE PACKAGE BUT THE- IT'S HYPOCRITICAL. TO JUST GO AFTER YOU KNOW PULLING GAS ENERGY SECTORS WHEREAS I THINK- I THINK IT WAS BETTER NEWMAN POINTED OUT THAT MANY OF THESE COMPANIES ARE ALREADY YOU. KNOW YOU HAVE. IN ALTERNATIVE ONE OF ENERGY I. AND OTHER. GLOBAL OUR CHEN OR LESS CARBON INTENSIVE GENERATION THANK YOU MUCH YOU KNOW BROADER WAY. HELLO TO REALLY YOU KNOW RIGHT. THE RESPONSIBLE. MAN AND THANK YOU TO MR IBM AND I THOUGHT YOU GONNA FOR US ALL LAST QUESTION THAT I TO MISS LANE ON BEHALF OF YOU KNOW ALL OF THE WITNESSES THE OPPOSITION IT IS JUST TO BE CLEAR IS IT TRUE THAT IT IS YOUR ASSESSMENT THAT THIS BILL WOULD NOT ONLY BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE RETURNS OF THE INVESTING FUNDS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WOULD BE WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE. HUNDRED PERCENT. THANK YOU. WORKING IN THIS INDUSTRY. WE SHOULD THAT SHOULD THANK YOU INDUSTRY BECAUSE I APOLOGIZE FOR BEING. SO THAT IS IF THAT'S HOW IT FEELS- BUT AS I SAID I YOU KNOW I DO BELIEVE IN THE IN THE LARGER GOAL- RIGHT AND I AM CONCERNED HOWEVER ABOUT THIS POLICY. THANK YOU MISTER. MR YEAH THANK YOU- JUST ONE SECOND SIR WHERE IT IN. THE IF. ANYBODY NEEDS THE EXACT- SECTION OF THE BILL THAT DEALS WITH THE SHERRY DUTY- JUST SPEAK UP WE CAN READ THAT OUT. PEOPLE CAN LOOK IT UP. THANK YOU A CENTER- THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANNA MAKE SOME COMMENTS AND FIRST. BOB THIS IS ONE OF THOSE PAINFUL HEARINGS WHERE. I HAD A LOT OF FRIENDS TESTIFIED ON EACH SIDE AND SO. ARE THAT IS ALWAYS DIFFICULT BECAUSE IT WAS HEARTFELT AND WRONG ON EACH AND I THINK ALTHOUGH IN SOME WAYS IT LIBERATES US TO TRY TO DO WE THINK IS RIGHT- WITHIN THAT. N. IT IT IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE I AM A FORTY YEAR. CREDIT MEMBER IN THE PER SYSTEM AND IT IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES I WAS VERY ACTIVE IN THE DIVESTMENT FROM SOUTH AFRICA MOVEMENT AND THAT HAPPENED THE VOTERS OF MY TOWN WHEN I WAS MAYOR APPROVED THE DIVESTMENT BALLOT MEASURE THAT WE PUT ON THE BALLOT. INTO A LOT OF THE SAME ARGUMENTS WERE MADE WE HEARD TODAY A. N. THOSE NEGATIVE THINGS DID NOT MATERIALIZE AND I THINK IN RETROSPECT ANYBODY THAT STOOD UP ARE FOR NOT INVESTING IN SOUTH AFRICA WAS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY. IN A AND A LOT OF THE SAME ARGUMENTS ARE MADE THIS IS GONNA BE LOSE WE'RE GOING TO LOSE MONEY IT'S GONNA PUSH THE PENSION SYSTEMS INTO A CORNER AND IT JUST DIDN'T I THINK THE SIGNIFICANT THING IN THE DEBATE THAT WAS GOING ON. WHAT THERE FIVE YEARS TO DIVEST THERE'S ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT CAME IN IN THE AMENDMENTS ABOUT. ACTS OF GOD AND EVERYTHING AND YOU KNOW NINE ELEVEN HAPPENED SO FOUR YEARS AND ELEVEN MONTHS AND TWENTY FIVE DAYS AND OKAY- THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU WOULD HOPE THAT THOSE AMENDMENTS WOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. BUT IN FIVE YEARS WITH THE PENSION SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE THE UPS THE DOWNS THE EVERYTHING TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THIS IN A WAY THAT IS RESPONSIBLE TO THE FIDUCIARY INTERESTED AND TO ME THAT TIME FRAME HAS BEEN THE TIME FRAME. IS THAT THAT HAS BEEN USED IT IN OTHERS AND THE- THERE THERE BEEN A LOT OF ARGUMENTS MADE AND I THINK SOME OF THEM ARE CONFLATING THINGS BECAUSE IT'S A WHOLE ISSUE OF NOT FROM INVESTING IN FOSSIL FUEL IN THESE TIMES BUT- THE SOMEBODY THAT SUPERVISED THE OIL REGULATOR FOR EIGHT YEARS IT THE ISSUE IS RIGHT THAT WAS SAID WE IMPORT A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF OIL IN CALIFORNIA. AND I THINK THAT IS AN ARGUMENT FOR THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY RELATED TO THIS BILL BUT IT IS A VERY VALID ARGUMENT IF YOU. YOU KNOW JERRY BROWN WAS FORTHRIGHT ON THAT ISSUE THAT ARM JEEZ IF WE FORCE ADDITIONAL. IMPORTS BECAUSE WE CUT CALIFORNIA PRODUCTION AND IT'S A CHOICE BETWEEN TANKERS AND OIL TRAINS AND ALL THESE THINGS THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY SAFE HOW WAS THAT SMART PUBLIC POLICY THE REAL PUBLIC POLICY. IS ABOUT LOWERING DEMAND IT AND THAT IS WHAT. HAS BEEN DONE IN THERE ALWAYS ARGUMENTS THAT WERE MADE LIKE. THAT CALIFORNIA WAS GOING TO GOT THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY BY DOING THE TAILPIPE STANDARDS AND WHAT HAPPENED. THERE WAS SO MUCH IN THE MARKET DRAINING TWO OUT OF THE COUNTRY CAR COMPANIES THAT MET WHAT THE CONSUMERS WANTED. THAT IN FACT THE GOVERNMENT HAD TO BAIL OUT OF THE U. S. AUTO COMPANIES IN TIME TO ALLOW THEM TO SHIFT TO WHERE THE PUBLIC WAS IN THE MARKET WAS AND WHEN THE- THE REGULATIONS WERE DONE NATIONALLY. VERY ALARMED AT THE OTHER FORTY NINE STATES WITH CALIFORNIA THAT WAS THE WAY THEY DEALT WITH IT AND THAT WAS. THE LOWERING DEMAND AND THAT THAT IS A LOGICAL ARGUMENT TO HAVE BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT'S CENTRAL TO THIS BILL. ON THIS BILL IS ABOUT INVESTING IN THE COMPANIES AND THE LOWERING DEMAND IS A SEPARATE ISSUE THAT I THINK WE STILL VERY MUCH HAVE TO ADDRESS. IT AND THE TOUGH THING IS THAT. I GROANED I HAVE A VERY RETAIL DISTRICT AND I MEET WITH PEOPLE ALL THE TIME AND I MEET WITH THESE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE JUST OLDER PEOPLE OF REALLY SCREWED THINGS UP THANKS FOR LEAVING THIS ARE WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT YOU WON'T EVEN BE HERE WHEN WE HIT THE BIGGER IMPACTS BUT- HE- YOU KNOW. HE I LIVE IN THIS PLACE WHERE WE TREASURE THE FOG IN THE SUMMER AND THE SUMMER BEFORE LAST. WE LOST NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE HOMES AND PLACES THAT IT NEVER BURNED BEFORE HISTORY. AND THE WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES WERE CONSIDERING A BILL NATURAL RESOURCES TOMORROW MORNING WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO FIGHT THE FIRE THE FIRE WAS AT FAULT FOR THREE OR FOUR DAYS. WE JUST HAD OUR FIRE DEPARTMENT AT THE CITY LIMITS ONE BIG WIND AND IT'S AND I WAS PACKED AND READY TO GO IN THIS TEMPERATE SEASIDE TOWN. AND EVERYBODY IS ASKING WHAT ARE WE DOING HOW ARE WE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MAKE A STATEMENT AND WE DEAL WITH IT AND IT'S- IT IS AND- I THINK SOME OF THE CONCERNS. NOT NOT ON THE INVESTMENT BUT ON THE JOBS ARE REALLY LEGITIMATE AND IT AND IT REALLY IS HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT. THAT THERE ARE JOBS THAT ARE GOOD PAYING JOBS WITH PENSIONS BUT- I DON'T THINK THAT MEANS ACCOMMODATING THE CHANGING CLIMATE IN A WAY THAT. THAT IS AFFECTING US EVERY YEAR WE SAY THE FIRE SEASON IS THE WORST IN HISTORY AND NOW. ALREADY PREDICTING THIS NEXT ONE'S GOING TO BE THE WORST IN HISTORY AND- AND WE ARE SEEING THE IMPACTS OF THE CHANGING CLIMATE NOW. AND SO. IT MAKES THIS REALLY DIFFICULT. BUT I THINK THAT. THERE'S ENOUGH BILL TO THIS BILL ON THE PAST. OF THINGS LIKE SOUTH AFRICA BUT SO CHAU WE HAVE FIVE YEARS TO DEAL WITH THIS. AND WE HAVE THE AMENDMENTS THAT TAKEN TO EMERGENCY SITUATIONS AND- IT N. I SUSPECT IF I WENT DOOR TO DOOR. IN MY DISTRICT I WOULD FIND OVERWHELMING SUPPORT FOR THIS AND SO. OF EVEN KNOW I WANT TO WORK TO TRY TO ACCOMMODATE EVERYBODY THAT TESTIFIED IN THEIR WAYS WE STILL HAVE TO DO IT. ARM I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL. FIVE ZERO ZERO THANK YOU- I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR. FOR GETTING INVOLVED IN THE WAY THAT IS GOING TO I THINK TAKE IS MORE IN THE DIRECTION. OF WHERE I PERSONALLY FEEL WE NEED TO GET- THE FIRST AMENDMENT I THINK IS. BECAUSE OF WHAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH WITH THE UKRAINE AND RUSSIA THAT MAKES SENSE TO PUT THAT IN MAYBE A FEW YEARS AGO WE WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT BUT WE ARE IN A REAL LIFE SITUATION REAL REAL TIME IN HERE- THIS IS NOT A- GOOD GUYS VERSUS THE BAD GUYS. THIS IS. GOOD GUYS BAD GUYS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE OF THE LINER THE EQUATION HERE ANNA I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. THAT EVERYONE WHO CALLED IN IN OPPOSITION IS NOT OPPOSE. TO A CLEANER ENVIRONMENT IS NOT OPPOSE IS NOT FIGHTING FOR THE JOBS BECAUSE THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT AND I THINK WE REALLY HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT AS WE LOOK TO FIND THESE- THE SOLUTIONS AND THE BEST WAY OF GETTING WHERE WE HAVE TO GET. OUT ONE THING- BUT IF IT WAS BROUGHT UP TODAY OR IN THE PAST IS THE AND I THINK THAT WAS A QUESTION BY- SENATOR NEWMAN IS THE IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE FOSSEL FEEL WHAT IS A FOSSIL FUELS. IF YOU'RE DOING BOTH YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE DOING BOTH PRODUCTION OF FOSSIL FUEL AND YOU'RE DOING PRODUCTION OF CLEAN CLEAN ENERGY SO I JUST WANT TO. FOR ME THESE AMENDMENTS- INDICATED THE- AN INCLUSION OF THE ISSUES THAT I CARE ABOUT. THAT WERE NOT IN THE OTHER VERSION OF. SO I WOULD LIKE TO ESPECIALLY OF THE ONE RELATED TO AND NOT CONTRIBUTING TO ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT WOULD DAMAGE THE RETIREMENT FUNDS OR THE EMPLOYMENT EARNINGS OF THE WORK FORCE IS SOMETHING THERE THAT I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT. MAYBE WE COULD CONTINUE TO I HOPE WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK ON AND THE OTHER ONE IS THE ADDAMS THE TIME FRAME. TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN HI WE'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THEE CONVERSATIONS OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS ABOUT WHAT YEAR HOW DO WE GET TO THAT FINAL THE GOALS AND YET YOU KNOW MAKE SURE- MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION AND NONE OF THEM ARE THIS. QUICK AND I KNOW QUICK SOUNDS TERRIBLE BECAUSE THINGS ARE HAPPENING- AS SENATOR LEONARD SAID YOU KNOW THESE FIRES AND EVERYTHING THAT'S THAT'S GOING ON BUT TO ME COMPARED TO THE OTHER ONES AND I'M NOT SURE IF THE IF THE AUTHOR HAS A- OF A PARTICULAR EXPLANATION AS TO WHY TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN. COMPARED TO A LOT OF THE OTHER STATES THAT WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS AS A STATE WORKING IN- AND UNDER MUCH YOU KNOW MORE. 552-040-2040 FIVE I KNOW THERE IS A CRISIS IS AN URGENCY BUT WHY EXISTE. COMPARED TO THE DATES THAT WERE ADDRESSING AS A STATE- BETTER FOR THEIR HUESO I HOPE. THAT BOTH OF REGARDS TO THE DATE ON BOTH OF AND THE SECOND AMENDMENT ON THE ECONOMIC IMPACT- THAT WE COULD. WORK FURTHER ON THAT FRONT BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S THE- MORE I UNDERSTAND THAT ARE CHAIR HAS BEEN WORKING ON THIS. OKAY THANK YOU- IF YOU'LL LET ME MAKE A COUPLE. THAT IS. THAT IS NOT MAYES MEDINA SOMEBODY. WE STILL HAVE A MODERATOR THAT CAN ASK PEOPLE TO ME THAT WAS NOT ME SOMEBODY JUST SPILLED ALL THEIR DISHES ON THE TABLE FOR NOVEMBER THAT'S RIGHT IT IS I THINK IT'S WORTH NOTING HERE THAT JUST ONE LAST COMMENT THAT CENTER LATE ACTION MADE A VERY GOOD POINT WHICH IS. EITHER THE WORK WE SHOULD BE DOING THE WORK WE ARE DOING BUT THERE THAT WE SHOULD REALLY ALWAYS IS ON DEMAND ON ON SHIFTING THE DEMAND CURVE IN CALIFORNIA SO I THINK THE QUESTION OF THE S. WITH RESPECT TO THIS BILL AS ADMIRABLE AS ITS INTENT IS DOES IT DO THAT AND I THINK THE ANSWER UNFORTUNATELY ISN'T NO IT WILL NOT DO THAT IT MAY IT MAY DEGENERATE SHIFT THE SUPPLY CURVE. RIGHT BY BY CHANGING KIND OF THE YOU KNOW THE FIVE FINANCIAL POSTURE BUNCH COMPANIES WHO IN THIS INDUSTRY- THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THE COSTING CALIFORNIANS MORE BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT CHANGED THE DEMAND IN CALIFORNIA WE WILL STILL AS AS I THINK MISCELLANY MENTION WITH YOU KNOW FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE- SOME. THIRTY MILLION PEOPLE GIVER TAKING CALIFORNIA WE DRIVING IT INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES AND UNTIL WE. FIGURE OUT HOW TO GIVE THEM AN ALTERNATIVE. MUCH OF THIS WON'T MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE WHEN FOR. ALTHOUGH IT WILL BE EIGHT EIGHT. YOU KNOW IN ANOTHER PRESENT FOR HOW WEAK- SORT PRESCRIBE TERMS TO CALPERS AND CAL STIRS. TO DO THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTY WHICH AGAIN I THINK FOLKS WHO MADE THEIR DOING THEIR BEST- AS IT IS- SO. WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT BACK TO YOU. OKAY THANKS CENTER. LET ME. LET ME JUST. SAY THIS AGAIN WHEN I THINK OF THE AUTHOR FOR ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS AT THIS COMMITTEES COME UP WITH TO. IMPART I THINK A SENATOR ALSO WAS ALLUDING TO- TO. TO BEGIN. A AS THIS LEGISLATIVE PROCESS HAS TO THIS BILL CONTINUES TO GO FORWARD. TO IDENTIFY ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE OF FURTHER DEBATED AND DELIBERATED- BE ON THE FIVE PERSONS IN THIS COMMITTEE AND I SAY. THAT EFFICACY THE EFFICACY OF THIS BILL IS IN QUESTION I'M I'M GOING TO SUPPORT. THE BILL BUT- QUESTION OF WHETHER IN THIS WILL MAKE AN IMPACT ON. THE REDUCTION OF GHG WHICH ACCORDING TO UNITED NATIONS THIS MORNING NEEDS TO BE ACHIEVED AT A 43% LEVEL BY TWENTY THIRTY OR WERE IN BIG TROUBLE- IN THAT'S NOT TO GIVE UP AFTER TWENTY THIRTY TO TWENTY THIRTY FIVE AND SO ON BUT THAT'S THE PIECE. THAT WE'RE TOLD BY- FOLKS IT SHOULD BE TRUSTED AT LEAST IN THIS COUNTRY- THE UNITED NATIONS IN IN SCIENTISTS AND EXPERTS FROM. ALMOST TWO HUNDRED DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD TELLING US THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO GET TO THE QUESTION IS DOES THIS PARTICULAR BILL HELP US GET THERE ANYMORE RAPIDLY THEN WE'RE GOING INTO THE GET THERE WITHOUT. HURTING WORKFORCE DOES HE GET THERE WITHOUT UNDERMINING THE WORKERS WHO ARE CURRENTLY PAYING IN OR WORKERS WHO ARE CURRENTLY- ENJOYING THE PENSIONS- I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW WHO'S HERE TODAY- ABOUT THE EFFICACY- I LISTEN TO EVERYONE VERY CAREFULLY TODAY. IN HIS. VERY DIFFICULT TO READ BUT WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION I DON'T THINK I COULD DO IT TODAY WHO WAS A BRILLIANT OPPOSITION- BUT IT'S ALSO- IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO READ BUT THE FACT THAT WE NEED TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD. IN I JUST WANT TO CLOSE MY OWN COMMENTS IN IN SUPPORT TODAY OF GETTING THIS BILL OUT OF COMMITTEE BY SAYING THE ONLY THING I'M ABSOLUTELY SURE OF THIS IS HERE TODAY IS THAT WE NEED TO GET THE BILL OUT OF COMMITTEE. SO THAT THIS ISSUE OF EFFICACY CAN CAN CAN ACHIEVE A BROADER DEBATE IN THIS LEGISLATURE SOMETIMES THAT HAPPENS AND SOMETIMES. OCCASIONALLY HERE AS EACH YEAR I FEEL THAT MY JOB IS SIMPLY SUPPORT OR OPPOSE LIKE EVERYONE ELSE IT COMES FORWARD. BASED ON MY VALUES. THERE ARE A FEW TIMES THAT MY JOB IS TO. MAKE SURE THAT THE BILL ADVANCES TO THE BROADER DEBATE THAT REALLY NEEDS TO HAPPEN ON THESE ISSUES- AND I THINK- EVEN IS ELAINE TALKING ABOUT THE BROADER DEBATE OF IF YOU'RE GOING TO DIVEST DO YOU AVOID THAT SLIPPERY SLOPE OR DO YOU EMBRACE THE ISSUE OF ALIGNING CALIFORNIA'S VALUES WITH THEIR PENSION INVESTMENT IS A MUCH BROADER DISCUSSION- IF THAT DISCUSSION IS GOING TO HAPPEN THIS YEAR IN THIS SESSION. WE NEED TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD BECAUSE IT'S OBVIOUSLY TRIGGERING THAT CONVERSATION AND I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING- WE- IF THE BILL GETS OUT TODAY LIKELY WE WILL ALL. HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A DECISION BASED ON OUR THIS IS OUR VALUES IN BASED ON WHAT WE THEN BELIEVE THE EFFICACY OF THE BILL AS FURTHER AMENDED IS AS FOR THE DEBATED- IN THAT'S GOING TO BE A TOUGH VOTE THIS COULD BE A TOUGH FOR B. AS WELL BUT TODAY I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR GETTING. THE BILL OUT OF COMMITTEE INCLUDED ALONG SO THAT BROADER DEBATE CAN OCCUR- THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY ANY OTHER COMMENTS OF METAL BY SHERRY I KNOW YOU HAVE TO QUESTIONS ALREADY BUT WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE CIRCLE BACK TO IN CASE THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE YOU NEED TO SAY IT IS JUST GETTING. BROWN TO OF COURSE. I JUST WANT O SORT OF JUST REITERATE THAT THE COMMENT THAT THE BILL AND- JUST THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE WITH REGARDS TO IF WE'RE GOING TO ADVANCE ANY ENVIRONMENTAL- PROGRESS YOU KNOW WITH THE URGENCY I THINK CALIFORNIA CAN LEAD THE WAY- AND IT HAS BEEN LEADING THE WAY THE PROBLEM IS THAT. WE WERE. REGULATING OUR OWN STATE THE POINT WHERE WE CAN'T DO. I DO A JOB WELL DONE AND WE EXPECT OTHER COUNTRIES TO DO IT ON OUR BEHALF WHETHER IT'S INVEST DIVESTMENT IN THIS IN YOUR WITH YOUR BILL BUT THE IMPACT THAT HAS ON THE MARKET- WITH. LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO PRODUCE AND MANUFACTURE HERE VERSUS HAVING TO IMPORTED I THINK IT'S JUST A MAJOR CONCERN FOR ME. BECAUSE AS AS MENTIONED EARLIER THE DEMAND IT HAS TO BE- AND I THINK WE ARE DOING PROGRESS IN THAT SENATOR- MAN I THINK I THINK THE CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA ARE BECOMING MUCH MORE EDUCATED AND THEY ARE MAKING. CHOICES THEY HAVE MORE CHOICES THAN THEY'VE EVER HAD BUT I THINK IT'S A SLOW PROCESS- JUST THE WAY THE HUMAN NATURE IS BUT I THINK CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN AND WILL BE LEADING THE WAY THE PROBLEM THAT I SEE. IS MOSTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING INTERNATIONALLY pBECAUSE I'VE BEEN IN THAT SITUATION WE'RE GOING TO START MOVING ALONG HERE AND TO TRY TO PICK UP THE PACE OF THE COMMITTEE AT THIS POINT- BUT AT THIS POINT WE- ENTERTAIN AS WELL SURE I WOULD HAVE. THE BILL. DID YOU MOVE THE BILL JUST THINK IT'S JUST GOING FOR A MOTION THANK YOU FOR THAT- THERE'S ON A MOTION FOR WAS CONSUMED CALL THE ROLL CALL- I'M SORRY CENTER CONSOLE AS YOU DO OF THE OPTICAL- I WAS LIKE YOU BEEN CLOSING ALL. ALONG HERE. KIND OF SORT OF AND I APPRECIATE THE DEBATEI REALLY DO REGARDLESS OF WHAT SIDE YOU'RE ON AND IN THE NEED FOR MORE DISCUSSION BECAUSE I THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED WAS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAD MORE DISCUSSION WE SHOULDN'T SHUT THE DOOR- ON THIS JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE SOME FRIENDS OPPOSE OR SORT OF SUPPORTING ART CETERA. AND I KNOW YOU'RE ALL- YOU ALSO PROVIDED REALLY INCREDIBLE INSIGHT AND I RESPECT THE OPPOSITION DEEPLY IN FACT I RESPECTED SO MUCH THAT I THINK THAT IF WE WOULD HAVE INVESTED QUITE HONESTLY A FEW YEARS AGO- ED CALPERS AND STIRS WOULD HAVE HAD ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN CLEAN ENERGY. WHICH WOULD HAVE SAID HAD YOU KNOW PEOPLE ON THE JOB RIGHT AWAY THIS CLEAN ENERGY FIELD AND I THINK WE COULD HAVE BUT EASE THE TRANSITION A LITTLE BIT FASTER IN THAT SENSE BUT- WITH ALL THAT SAID I JUST WANT TO SAY AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE DEBATE THERE'S AGAIN. THANK YOU TO BOOKS HAVE COME IN PERSONALLY TO DEBATE AND MANY MANY FOLKS THAT CALLED IN- AT THE END OF THE DAY WE HAVE TO REALLY LOOK AT THE RISKS AND OF COURSE IN THE RATE OF RETURN. THE BEST MEANT- HAS BEEN PROVEN AGAIN AGAIN AND AGAIN NOT JUST GLOBALLY BUT HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO NOT BE THAT RISK THAT HAS BEEN- THE ALLUDED TO BY SOME OF THE OPPOSITION. AND SO- I ASK US TO CONTINUE THE DEBATE AND TO CONTINUE DISCUSSING ON BOTH SIDES AND I WELCOME THE OPPOSITION OF THE LIKE TO SIT DOWN WITH ME TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND IN A WAY THAT'S RESPECTFUL BUT IN A WAY THAT ACTUALLY GET SOME STUFF DONE FOR. FOR A STATE THE WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE IN ELEVEN SEVENTY THREE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SENATOR. NO CONSULTANT FROM THE. PICKEREL CALLED. THE MOTION TO PASS.

OKAY AND THEN LAST QUESTION- THERE HAS BEEN A QUESTION THAT HAS ARISEN WITH REGARDS TO WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS AN ITEM THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED WITHIN THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNITS WOULD YOU LIKE TO. MAKE A COMMENT ON THAT- NO I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO BRING THIS IN LINE. AGAIN TO. THE REST OF THE WORKERS WHO. OUR CONSIDER ME GIVEN THE SAME LEVEL OF CONSIDERATION FOR REST BREAKS AS WE SAID NURSES IN PRIVATE SECTOR ARE FORTY- THESE BREAKS AND THEY DO THE EXACT SAME WORKS SO I DON'T SEE IT AS A COMPLETE CUT OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ISSUE BUT- I'LL LET MY- WITNESSES MY EXPERT ITNESSES AT AND IF THEY HAVE SOMETHING THAT THEIR- SURE ABSOLUTELY- MADAM CHAIR. I'D ALSO ADD THAT. BUT THE BARGAINING IS CONSIDERED IN THIS BILL IT ACTUALLY EXEMPT. FROM THESE PROVISIONS EMPLOYEES ARE COVERED BY COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT IF THAT'S HELPFUL. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT M. AS A WE HAVE A MOTION TO MOVE THE BILL BY SENATOR RAZA. OKAY LET'S SEE DRAW SO THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST AMEND AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS MOTION IS TO PASS THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND FOR TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS CORTES C. OR CHOI BO. NO FOR TROUBLED NO THE RUSSELL. HI THE REST OF I LAYERED NEWMAN AYE NEWMAN I MOVEMENT THAT. I WILL PUT THAT FELL ON THE CALL FOR ABSENT MEMBERS. THANK YOU OF CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU. I KNOW THAT THERE. IS A- NEXT WE HAVE SENATOR LEYVA PRESENTING SB. THIRTEEN FORTY THREE. READY PLEASE PROCEED GET ALL RIGHT GOOD EVENING EVERYONE ALL RIGHT GOOD AFTERNOON MATT OR EVENING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS SB THIRTEEN FORTY THREE SIX TO ENSURE THAT EVERY TEACHER HAS A RETIREMENT SECURITY AFFORDED TO THEM BY OUR STATE PENSION SYSTEM. SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL REQUIRES ALL CHARTER SCHOOLS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE TEACHERS RETIREMENT SYSTEM CAL STIRS AND IN THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SYSTEM CALPERS ACCORDING TO CAL STIRS BETWEEN 2240% OF NEWLY CREATED CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE OPTING FOR AN ALTERNATIVE RETIREMENT SYSTEM. BY NOT ALLOWING TEACHERS TO ACCESS A DEFINED BENEFIT SYSTEM TEACHERS ARE LEFT WITH RETIREMENT OPTIONS THAT ARE HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON MARKET FLUCTUATIONS CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE FUNDED WITH PUBLIC DOLLARS AND SHOULD ENSURE THAT THEIR EMPLOYEES ARE FOR THE SAME RETIREMENT OPPORTUNITIES AS ALL OTHER PUBLIC EMPLOYEES. EVERY TEACHER SHOULD HAVE THE SAME OPTIONS NO MATTER WHICH PUBLIC SCHOOL THEY DECIDE TO TEACH AT TEACHERS ALREADY DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS THEY SHOULD NOT BE ADDITIONALLY FINANCIALLY HAMPERED BY NOT HAVING ACCESS TO CAL STIRS ARE CALPERS. EACH TEACHER TEACHER SHOULD HAVE A CHOICE. SB THIRTEEN FORTY THREE ALSO PUT SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE FOR RETIREMENT PAYMENTS WHEN A CHARTER SCHOOL FALLS BEHIND- SHUTS ITS DOORS COMPLETELY. WHEN THIS OCCURS THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AND WHICH TO CHARTER SCHOOLS LOCATED HAS BEEN REQUIRED TO PAY THE BILL THIS CAN LEAVE THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION WITH TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN UNEXPECTED. AND UNWARRANTED RETIREMENT PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS SB THIRTEEN FORTY THREE CORRECTS THIS BY REQUIRING COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION TO WITHHOLD A REASONABLE PORTION. OF THE CHARTER SCHOOLS FUNDING DISBURSEMENT AND PAY THE RETIREMENT RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS TO EACH SYSTEM AUTOMATICALLY. SB FOUR THIRTEEN FORTY THREE IS ABOUT PROVIDING ALL PUBLIC EMPLOYEES WITH THE RETIREMENT SECURITY THEY DESERVE AND ARE FORWARDED. TEACHERS PROVIDE GUIDANCE SUPPORT AND AN EDUCATION TO OUR MOST VULNERABLE OUR CHILDREN. THE LEAST WE CAN DO IS GIVE THEM ACCESS TO A SECURE RETIREMENT SYSTEM. MY OFFICE HAS BEEN WORKING WITH CAL STIRS A CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS TO DO THE FOLLOWING. OFTEN ONLY HAPPENS WHEN A NEW CHARTER SCHOOLS CREATED NOT A REAL AUTHORIZATION. THIS WILL MEAN AN EXISTING CHARTER THAT HASN'T BEEN PARTICIPATING ANSWERS OUR PURSE IS REAUTHORIZED NOTHING CHANGES FOR THEM THEY WILL BE LEFT OUT OF THIS BILL. WITH ME TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT AND ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS IS TRISTEN BROWN WITH THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR LEVEL NOW MOVED OUR LEAD SUPPORT WAIT DISTRICTS AND BROWN ARE YOU ON THE LINE. HE'S ON RIGHT HERE IN PERSON SORRY. IT IS AMAZING TO BE HERE IN PERSON OUT OF HERE IN MEMBERS AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK- TROSZYN BROWN CFT IN A UNION OF EDUCATORS IN CLASS I PROFESSIONALS WE ARE THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL- YOU KNOW IN SOME WAYS I THINK IT'S- PULLING UP A HOLE IN THE BOAT- STIRS HAS RELEASED REPORTS. ON HOW YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT A- TIMELINE IN THIRTY YEAR INCREMENTS ON HOW TO- HAVE FOLKS PAY AND THEN GET THEIR DEFINED BENEFITS- WE START TO SEE A LITTLE BIT OF A SHORTFALL AS MORE AND MORE SCHOOLS. MY CODE THE CHARTER ROUTE WITHOUT EATING AND STIRS AND PURRS AND SO THIS IS GOING TO PATCH THAT HOLE- AND HAVE THAT EVERY NEW CHARTER DON'T KNOW EXISTING WILL BE BROUGHT IN AS AS WHAT THE SENATOR SAID IN ORDER AMEND OTHER ARE PENDING AMENDMENTS. BUT THAT ALL NEW CHARTERS WILL THEN JOIN THE PUBLIC PENSION SYSTEMS AS ALL OTHER- PUBLIC EDUCATION ENTITIES ARE A WE BELIEVE THAT A PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER WHO TEACHES AT A PUBLIC SCHOOL- SHOULD HAVE THE THEIR RIGHT TO THEIR PUBLIC RETIREMENT. THEY DO NOT HOUSE OF SECURITY BENEFITS- IN THE STATE- AND THEN ON THE CLASSIFIED SIDE- IT'S THE SAME IF THOSE MEMBERS ARE CONTRACTED OUT WHICH STILL IS POSSIBLE FOR CHARTERS TO DO- THEN THEY TOO WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR CALPERS BENEFIT AND HAVE SOME RETIREMENT SECURITY- BY THE TIME THE FINISH THEIR CAREER. WE WANT TO DO NO HARM EITHER TO INDIVIDUALS OR THE SYSTEM WHICH IS WHY WE'RE NOT GOING TO BRING IN EXISTING CHARTERS AND IF THEY'RE NOT PARTICIPATING HE GETS TO BE A BIT OF A LOGISTICAL NIGHTMARE HAVING FOLKS COME IN. BUT ALSO YOU KNOW IF FOLKS WERE TO MOVE FROM WITHIN AND WITHOUT OF THE SYSTEM- IF YOU'RE A PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER THAT IS TAUGHT AT A TRADITIONAL SCHOOL FOR SAY FIFTEEN YEARS. AND THEN YOU WANTED TO TAKE A JOB AT A CHARTER SCHOOL THAT'S NOT PARTICIPATING YOU MIGHT NOT BE AWARE THAT AS A PUBLIC TEACHER IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL YOU'RE NO LONGER ATTAINING PUBLIC RETIREMENT CREDIT. AND SO WE WANT TO AT LEAST START. TO LIVE AS I SAY STOP THE LEAK AND FROM HERE ON OUT MAKE SURE THAT ALL PUBLIC EDUCATORS ARE IN THE PUBLIC RETIREMENT SYSTEM AND HAVE MORE OF ASECURE RETIREMENT WHEN THEIR. TIME IS UP SO WITH THAT WE ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. AND ALL. HERE FOR QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER BROWN WILL NOW MOVE ON TO OUR SECOND LEAD SUPPORT WITNESS MISTER ERIC WE MET.

OUR CONCERN ABOUT THE BILL FOR SEVERAL REASONS FIRST OFF IT IMPOSES FACTORING LEE HIGH COSTS AS ALL OF YOU KNOW- ASSOCIATED WITH THAT A PUBLIC PENSION SYSTEMS. AND AS MANY OF YOU KNOW PARTICULAR MEMBER OR CHOI BOGUE SERVES ON BUDGET SUB ONE CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE NOT FUNDED COMPARABLY TO TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND NEW SCHOOLS IN PARTICULAR HAVE AVERY DIFFICULT TIME. OF MEETING THEIR EXPENSES SECOND IT WOULD WREAK HAVOC WITH NEW CHARTER SCHOOLS PARTICULARLY EVEN AS THE BILL IS AMENDED IF I UNDERSTAND AMENDMENTS CORRECTLY THEY'RE NOT IN PRINT BUT- AS I UNDERSTAND IT WOULDN'T POSE THIS REQUIREMENT A NEW CHARTER SCHOOLS AND IF A- PRE EXISTING NONPROFIT COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION THAT HAS EXISTING RETIREMENT SYSTEMS WANTS TO START A CHARTER SCHOOL. THIS WOULD MAKE THINGSVERY COMPLICATED BY EFFECTIVELY MANDATING TWO DIFFERENT PENSION SYSTEMS AND SCHEMES WHICH NOT ALLOWED UNDER FEDERAL TAX LAW AND PENSION OFF. THIRD IT MANDATES THAT COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS- TAP WITH UP TO THREE MONTHS OF CHARTER SCHOOLS RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTIONS IN ADVANCE CREATING SIGNIFICANT CASH FLOW PROBLEMS AND AGAIN NEW SCHOOLS IN PARTICULAR. ARE USUALLY VERY LEAN ON CASH PARTICULARLY GIVEN HOW LATE THE STATE PROVIDES MONEY TO SCHOOLS. UNDER THE STATE'S FUNDING SYSTEM- FINALLY IT GRANTS. STURGEON PERS UNFETTERED AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH- JUST ABOUT ANY RULE OR REGULATION IF THEY WANT- AND WE THINK THAT'S AN INAPPROPRIATE DELEGATION OF WHAT SHOULD BE LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY- THERE ARE A NUMBER OF TECHNICAL CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE WITH THE BILL WE UNDERSTAND THAT FOLKS ARE WORKING ON THOSE BUT- GIVEN OUR LARGER CONCERNS WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL VOTE IN OPPOSITION OR LAY OFF THE BILL.

SHIRTS TEACHERS.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS A PLACE- HAS IN PLACE A POLICY. EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK. AND THAT POLICY REQUIRES VENDOR COMPANIES THAT HAVE ONE OF AN ESTIMATED FOUR HUNDRED SERVICE CONTRACTS WITH YOU SEE. TO PAY THEIR COMPANY'S EMPLOYEES. WAGES AND BENEFITS EQUAL. TO WHAT YOU SEE. PAYS ITS OWN SERVICE WORKERS WHO WORK DIRECTLY FOR YOU SEE. UC'S RESPONSIBLE VENDOR COMPANY VIOLATIONS OF THIS POLICY HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR S. B. THIRTEEN SIXTY FOUR. AND THE PAY INFORMATION REQUIRED UNDER THIS BILL. QUOTE UNIVERSITY IS NOT THE EMPLOYER OF THESE INDIVIDUALS AND DOES NOT HAVE THIS INFORMATION AND QUOTE. THOUSANDS OF IMPACTED SERVICE WORKERS WE DO NOT DO NOT WORK FOR YOU SEE NOR ARE THEY COVERED BY A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT. AND SINCE NO LAW REQUIRES THE PRIVATE EMPLOYERS TO TELL THESE WORKERS THAT UNIVERSITY OR ANY STATE AGENCY HOW WAGES AND BENEFITS BEING PAID COMPARED TO WHAT THE UC. EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK REQUIRES THERE IS NO EFFECTIVE OR LEGAL WAY FOR WORKERS TO ENFORCE THE UC POLICY OR A PATH WHERE WORKERS TO RECOVER THEIR LOST WAGES. IT IS IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THE BILL WILL NOT NEGATIVELY IMPACT ANY STRIDES YOU SEE IS MAKING TOWARDS ANY THIRD PARTY VENDOR COMPLIANCE. THE BILL MILL IT MERELY PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY. FOR WORKERS TO RESOLVE A SITUATION WHERE YOU SEE WAS GIVEN MISINFORMATION BY THE VENDOR WITH THE VENDOR MADE AN HONEST MISTAKE OR WHERE THERE WAS A CLEAR VIOLATION OF THE UC'S. EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK POLICY SB THIRTY SIXTY FOUR CRATES OF FAIR ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM OF REQUIRING THE VENDOR TO SUPPLY TO YOU SEE AND ANY JOINT LABOR MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE THE BASIC PAYROLL INFORMATION NECESSARY. TO KNOW IF A VENDOR IS ABIDING BY YOU SEE POLICY THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE OF VENDOR TO SUPPLY A WRITTEN NOTICE TO THEIR EMPLOYEES ABOUT THE RELEVANT COMPENSATION RATES AND WOULD ALLOW A CONTRACTING VENDOR COMPANY AN OPPORTUNITY TO CURE. ANY DISCREPANCIES BEFORE FACING ANY CONSEQUENCE HOWEVER REFUSAL TO COMPLY WOULD RESULT IN EMPLOYEES HAVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE RECOVERY OF LOST WAGES IN COURT.
