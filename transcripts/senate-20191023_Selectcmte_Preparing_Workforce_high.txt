SELECT COMMITTEE PREPARING CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE WORK FORCE- I'M GONNA BE JOINED SHORTLY BY WITH BY SENATOR STEVE GLAZER I'M- GONNA TAKE AN EARLY OPPORTUNITY THIS THANK HIM FOR COMING. TO SACRAMENTO TO- PARTICIPATE IN THIS HEARING AND TO THINK ALL THE PRESENTERS THAT ARE HERE TODAY- VERY HONORED TO HAVE YOU- THIS THIS- THIS WHOLE ISSUE OF WORKFORCE PREPARATION IS CRITICALLY AND IMPORTANT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE'VE BEEN HALF WE'VE HAD AN UNPRECEDENTED TEN YEARS OF A BOOMING ECONOMY WHICH IS MOVED US FROM THE EIGHTH. EIGHTH GDP EIGHT NATION IF WE WERE NATION IN THE WORLD TO FIFTH AND- AND WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S TENDS TO SEE THESE EIGHT YEAR ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS IN THE IN THE ECONOMY AND SO WERE WERE ON PATH AT SOME POINT TO HAVE A SLOWDOWN IN THE ECONOMY BUT BUT DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE'VE HAD THESE- INCREDIBLE ECONOMIC GAINS THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT- A NUMBERS IN- I WANNA SAY FOR DICK DECADES. THERE ARE BEEN PARTS OF THE STATE THAT HAVEN'T SEEN THE SAME ECONOMIC UPTURN IN THE ECONOMY AND SOME PARTS OF THE STATE THAT CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE ECONOMICALLY AND- IT A LOT OF THAT IS IT IS REFLECTED IN MY DISTRICT WHICH IS THE TWELFTH SENATE DISTRICT THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THERE WERE FOUR ISSUES OF GREATEST CONCERN- IT WHEN I WAS WHEN I WAS HAVING MY HOUSE MEETINGS AND THAT THE FOUR ISSUES ARE INTRICATELY RELATED TO EACH OTHER FIRST WAS WATER SECOND WAS POVERTY AND CONCERN THERE WAS WORKERS EARNING BELOW THE POVERTY. LEVEL UP THE HIGH COST OF HOUSING. RENTAL OWNER FROM OWNERSHIP AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND JOB. REALLY CONNECTED TO HOW YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE MEDIAN INCOME THAT PEOPLE EARNING AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND WHAT CAN YOUNG PEOPLE LOOK FOR TO IF THEY STAY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY- IN TERMS OF A OF A LIVABLE WAGER OR A WAGE THAT THEY CAN AFFORD TO- TO BUY A HOUSE OR TO REALLY RENT. A HOUSE THEMSELVES WITHOUT HAVING HAVE BY THEIR FAMILIES LIVING WITH THEM WHAT WHAT I'VE SEEN IN TERMS OF THE HOUSING MARKET FOR MANY YEARS BUT IT'S BECOME ACT EXACERBATED THE LAST- THE UPTURN IN THE ECONOMY ACTUALLY SINCE THE DOWNTURN IN THE- IN THE ECONOMY WITH THE WITH THE MORTGAGE MORTGAGE MELTDOWN IS SIGNIFICANT OVERCROWDING. LONG COMMUTES PEOPLE ARE MOVING FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY FROM THEIR PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT LATCH KEY KIDS THAT ARE LEFT FOR HOURS BY THEMSELVES WELCOME SENATOR DANGER I DO IN ESSENTIAL FOR BEING HERE TODAY APPRECIATE IT. VERY MUCH. SOCIAL AND SECURITY THAT BEDS CREATED WHEN FAMILIES OR ARE FORCED TO LET AND ANNETTE. RELATED FAMILIES ARE FORCED TO- RENT TOGETHER IN ORDER TO SURVIVE- SENIOR DISPLACEMENT AND HOMELESSNESS ALL OF THESE HAVE BEEN KIND OF FRONT AND CENTER ON ON THE RADAR- ALL OVER THE STATE IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOU WHERE YOU LIVE. AND I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY RECENTLY TO DURING THIS INTERIM TO DO TOURS AND VISITS FOR A PROGRAMS IN THE DISTRICT THAT PREPARE STUDENTS TO ENTER THE WORKFORCE. AND THAT THE PROPONENTS OF THOSE PROGRAMS TALK ABOUT THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE SKILLS- DID THE STUDENTS HAVE IN THE JOBS THAT ARE AVAILABLE OUT IN THE COMMUNITY SO. THE CRITICAL ISSUE IS GOING TO BE WHAT ARE WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO TO BE ABLE TO- INSURE THAT OUR STUDENTS HAVE THE BEST OPPORTUNITY- ANY WORKER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS THE BEST OPPORTUNITY TO GET TRAINING. THAT WILL PREPARE THEM TO BE ABLE TO EARN EARN A LOW WAGE WHERE THEY CAN. ACTUALLY LIVE IN A IN A UNIT BY THEMSELVES AND I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH A COMMUNITY COLLEGE- STAFF MEMBER- ADMINISTRATOR AND THEIR ANALYSIS IN MODESTO IS THAT. A WORKER NEEDS TO EARN AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO LIVE IN A COMMUNITY. AND OUT SO ANYONE EARNING UNDER THAT WHICH IS. BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL IS FORCED INTO THESE UNTENABLE HOUSING SITUATIONS AND THAT OBVIOUSLY IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO KEEP PERPETUATING SO THE GOAL OF THIS IN AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING IS TO. EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF THE LACK OF SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE. IT DID TO INQUIRE AS TO WHETHER THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN URBANIZED AREAS AND RURAL COMMUNITIES. TO UNDERSTAND WHAT SOME OF THE BEST PRACTICE MODELS ARE FOR PREPARING THE WORK FORCE. AND WHAT IS A STATE NEED TO DO TO INCENTIVIZE A LONG TERM COMMITMENT TO THOSE BEST PRACTICES. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE PREPARING STUDENTS FOR THE JOBS OF THE FUTURE TO AND BUILD. BILL THE UNITS NEEDED TO HOUSE OUR WORKFORCE BECAUSE WE CAN'T DO THAT THEN- WE'RE GONNA END UP IN A SITUATION WHERE WE CONTINUE TO SEE HOUSING BE ONE OF OUR CRITICAL NUMBER ONE ISSUES AND FRANKLY. PEOPLE CAN DISCOVER PRETTY QUICKLY THAT- THAT THEY MOVE WITH TEIR WITH THEIR FEET INDEED THE GO TO OTHER COMMUNITIES OTHER PLACES OTHER STATES WHERE THEY CAN AFFORD. TO EARN A LIVING THERE AND AFFORD TO BE ABLE TO BUY THE HOUSING UNITS THERE AS WELL SO OBVIOUSLY NOT IN OUR INTEREST TO DO THAT AND SO- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE AND- WITHOUT ANY FURTHER ADO WE'LL GET INTO OUR HEARING BUT I WANT TO. TURN THE MIKE OVER TO SENATOR GLACIER FOR A FEW COMMENTS. THANK YOU US CHAIR IT'S GOOD TO BE HERE AND I APPRECIATE YOURLEADERSHIP AND CALLING THIS- HEARING AND CONTINUING THIS CONVERSATION THAT HAS GONE ON FOR DECADES IN NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO GO ON FOR DECADES BECAUSE A SKILLED WORK FORCE IS SO CRITICAL- TO CALIFORNIA TO OUR ECONOMIC HEALTH TO THE WELL BEING OF OUR OUR WORKFORCE AND OUR WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THE WITNESSES THAT ARE COMING IN TODAY TO SHARE THEIR EXPERTISE WITH US THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND THANK YOU THE CHAIR FOR. GIVING IN THIS VERY IMPORTANT HEARING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS INTRODUCE THE FIRST A- PANEL AND IF YOU COULD COME FORWARD- LOOKING HERE. I THINK WE'VE GOT FOUR SEATS THERE.

THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE AND. SAYS THAT WILL TURN THE MIKE OVER TO YOU ALL THANK YOU SENATOR HOWARD PAUL JOYCE- FOR MY TARDINESS. NOW YOU WERE PERFECT IT WAS PERFECTLY ON TIME- AND I APPRECIATE THE YES WERE MISSED MY WORDS OF WISDOM ALL YEAH LARA. I'VE HEARD HIM BEFORE AND I AGREE A 100% IT'S A GREAT DANCER- THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER FOR ALSO BEING HERE AND- FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THIS FROM BORDEN ISSUE OUT THAT WE HAVE BEEN- FOLLOWING FOR A LONG TIME AND OF COURSE IS THERE DIRECTLY CARLY DID WITH THE- ISSUE OF LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR HOUSING IN GENERAL TO ADDRESS THE- HOUSING NEEDS OF THE CAMPUS A CALIFORNIA- WE DID. ACTUALLY EARLY ON- COMMISSION A STUDY OF TO LOOK AT THE ISSUES IMPACTING THE INDUSTRY AND WE'VE- FOUND SOME OF THE KEY ISSUES RELATED TO THE ACTUAL JOB QUALITY ASPECTS. OF WHY A LOT OF WORKERS ARE CHOOSING TO BE INTO THE RESIDENTIAL MARKET NOW- BECAUSE OF SEVERAL FACTORS RIGHT IN AND SO- WE WILL BE RELEASING THAT STUDY- FAIRLY SOON AND- THREE GET TO HEAR A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT WE ACTUALLY. COMPILED AND LEARN FROM THAT SO OUR ULTIMATE THOSE OF TALKING POINTS IN THE PRESENTATION TO THE COMMITTEE AS WELL AND BE GREAT OKAY SO. HERE'S WHAT WE FOUND THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING SUPPLY HAS LAGGED. A DEMAND DUE TO DECLINING RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTIVITY. THE COLLAPSE OF SINGLE FAMILY HOME BUILDING AND THE X. URBAN AREAS. BURGEONING INEQUALITY. AND RESTRICTIVE LAMP POLICIES FOR HIGH DEMAND LOCALITIES. THESE FACTORS HAVE CONTRIBUTED CONTRIBUTE TO A CRISIS CHARACTERIZED BY LOW HOMEOWNERSHIP HI RENTS AND SALE PRICES. DISPLACEMENT AND WORSENING HOMELESSNESS. STATE OFFICIALS ESTIMATE THAT AT LEAST ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION NEW HOMES HOUSING UNITS ARE NEEDED BETWEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TO KEEP UP WITH THE POPULATION GROWTH. THE GOVERNOR'S INDICATED THREE POINT FIVE MILLION THAT'S A HIGH NUMBER WHICH WE HAVEN'T REACH SINCE THREE HUNT US SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX WILL REACH THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND SO WORK. WILL YOU HAVE TO RAMP UP TO GET TO THAT NUMBER DEFINITELY WANT TO BE PARTISAN DOING THAT. SO WE NEED WE SEE THAT THE STATE LEADERSHIP SUCH AS YOURSELVES INTO ADDRESS OUR RELATED FACTORS IMPACTING WHERE AND WHAT TYPE OF HOUSING IS BUILT. AND HOW IS IT HOW IS IT BRUCE. THEY GET TO HAVE INCENTIVES FOR SPRAWLING SINGLE FAMILY HOME DEVELOPMENT AND IT INDUSTRIES RELIANCE ON LOW WAGE. LOW SKILL LABOR. ARE COLLIDING WITH GROWING DEMAND FOR DENSER URBAN LIFESTYLES. TODAY'S RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY SUFFERS FROM A SHORTAGE OF PRODUCTIVITY. WORKERS AND CONTRACTORS READYTO BUILD MULTI FAMILY HOUSING. AND FACES LABOR MARKET COMPETITION FROM ROCK NONRESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION EMPLOYERS OFFERING BETTER WAGES AND WORKING CONDITIONS. THE TRADITIONAL MODEL USING UNSKILLED LABOR TO BUILD SPRAWLING TRACK BOXES. ON CHEAP SUBURBAN LAND HAS NOT WORKED FOR CALIFORNIA. WHEN YOU THINK BEG AND WE NEED TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX. THIS WHY WE SUPPORTED BILLS LIKE SENATE BILL FIVE BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE MORE OF A FOCUS ON THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND IT ALSO PROVIDES A COUNTER CYCLICAL ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES BY CREATING GOOD QUALITY JOBS. THIS OUR BELIEF THAT PUBLIC SECTOR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY IS A PROVEN TOOL FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH. IF WE CAN BUILD DAMS BRIDGES AND POWER PLANTS THERE'S NO REASON WHY WE CANNOT BUILD MORE HOMES. THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF PARTNERSHIPS TO PROVIDE EXPERTISE AND EXPERIENCE IN TO PROJECT DELIVERY. BUILDING TRADES UNIONS. TO PROVIDE THE BILL OF THE SKILLED WORKFORCE AND A PARTNERSHIP COMPORT OPPORTUNITIES IN CONSTRUCTION. AND PUBLIC AGENCIES WITH LAND LEADERSHIP AND RESOURCES TO MAKE LARGE SCALE PROJECTS FEASIBLE. LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS TO LOOSEN RESTRICTIONS ON APARTMENT BUILDING AND OPEN MORE ARE ALREADY DEVELOPED AREAS PROMISED TO FIX THE WHAT AND WHERE PART OF THE STATE'S HOUSING PROBLEM. HOWEVER THIS THEY MUST ALSO ADDRESSED THE HOUSE OF PRODUCTION AND ENSURE THE INDUSTRY HAS A STABLE SUPPLY OF SKILLED WORKERS TO DO THE BUILDING. SO FAR REPORTS CALL THE HIGH. HOUSING HI ROAD REPORT. AND WAS COMISSION EARLY IN TWENTY NINETEEN THIS IS WERE IT FIND SOME OF THOSE NUMBERS CALIFORNIA WILL NEED BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND AND THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE THOUSAND RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WORKERS. IN ORDER TO MEET ITS AMBITIOUS HOUSING PRODUCTION GOALS AND BASICALLY DEPENDING ON WHAT THOSE PRODUCTION GOALS ARE. WITH ONLY A HUNDRED AND GIVE ME TO SURE AGAIN IS AT NEW NEW WORKERS THE WORKERS YES. WITH ONLY AROUND A HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN THOUSAND RESIDENTIAL BUILDING CONSTRUCTION WORKERS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO DOUBLE OR TRIPLE ITS WORKFORCE EMPLOYED IN NEW HOUSING CONSTRUCTION. THE LA METRO AREA REQUIRES BOUGHT A HUNDRED THOUSAND RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION WORKERS AND SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA NEEDS ABOUT FIFTY SIX THOUSAND WORKERS TO MEET GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S HOUSING PRODUCTION GOALS UNDER HISTORICALLY HIGH WORKER PRODUCTIVITY SCENARIO. LA WILL NEED MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO THOUSAND RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION WORKERS IN THE BAY AREA WILL NEED NEARLY SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND IF PRODUCTIVITY REMAINS AT CURRENT LEVELS. LINKING PREVAILING WAGE RATHER FAIR WAGE STANDARDS WELL ACTUALLY AN APPRENTICESHIP PROVISIONS TO ANY LAND USE RELATED REGULATORY CHANGES WOULD HELP ACHIEVE THESE GOALS. CONSTRUCTION WAGES AND BENEFITS ARE TYPICALLY 15% OF TOTAL MULTI FAMILY RESIDENTIAL PROJECT COSTS. AND RECENT RESEARCH SHOWS A MINIMAL COST IMPACT FROM PREVAILING WAGE IN SUBSIDIZED MULTI FAMILY CONSTRUCTION. TO ACHIEVE ALL THESE HIGH NUMBERS ON FOR A LONG TIME WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH CITY CALIFORNIA IN THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY- TO ALIGN THE WORK FOR SYSTEM AS IT RELATES TO CONSTRUCTION. AND ARE NOW AS IT STANDS THE CITY CALIFORNIA LOOKS AT WHAT'S CALLED THE MULTI CRAFT CORE CURRICULUM MORE MC THREE. AS THE APPRENTICESHIP THE PRE APPRENTICESHIP CURRICULUM OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MEANING THAT ALL LOCAL WHIPS USING MC THREE MODEL AND ALSO WAS INCORPORATED INTO THE SP ONE THE ACTUAL OF ROAD ROAD CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE. OF FUNDS TO ATTRACT MORE PEOPLE INTO THE TRADES- THERE ARE CERTAIN CROPS THAT ARE GOING TO BE WORKING ON ROAD MAINTENANCE AND CONSTRUCTION BUT NOT ALL THE CRAFTS WE REPRESENT- FOURTEEN CROSS BUT THERE ARE FIFTEEN IN THE BUILDING TRADES ALL TOGETHER WHICH INCLUDE THE CARPENTERS. MULTI CRAFT QUIRK ALERT CAM OF INSURERS THAT. WHOEVER IS INTERESTED IN CONSTRUCTION HAS ACCESS TO ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT- TRAITS AND SO IF THEY'RE INTERESTED IN THIS SPECIFIC TRADE AND IF THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY THERE'S A HIGHER LIKELIHOOD THAT THAT PERSON WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THEIR- APPRENTICESHIP. AND APPLY FOR SOMETHING WHERE THERE'S ACTUAL NEED FOR THEIR WORK. ON CERTAIN AREAS WILL BE SATURATED WITH A LOT OF WORKERS ALREADY SKILLED IN ROAD MAINTENANCE AND SO FOR THAT REASON THE MULTI CRAFT CORE CURRICULUM WORKS FOR A LOT OF THOSE LOCALITIES. SO LOOKING OUT PRODUKTIVNOSTI NUMBER OF HOMES BUILT BY THE SECTORS WORKFORCE IS CURRENTLY LESSEN SEVENTY FOUR PERCENT. OF ITS NINETEEN NINETY TWO THOUSAND FIVE AVERAGE. THE RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION WORK FORCES ALSO GROWING OLDER YOUNG WORKERS ARE EMPLOYED IN HOME BUILDING AT LOWER RATES THAN OTHER SECTORS OF THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY. SINCE NINETEEN NINETY THREE THE SHARE OF HOUSING CONSTRUCTION WORKERS BETWEEN THE AGES OF EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY FOUR AND TWENTY FIVE AND THIRTY FOUR IS ONLY 68% OF ECONOMY NIGHT WIDE AVERAGES. WORKERS OVER FORTY FIVE HAVE BECOME OVER REPRESENTED BY TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT. IN THE HOUSING SECTOR. HIRING RATES FOR HOUSING CONSTRUCTION WORKERS BETWEEN THE AGES EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY FOUR AND TWENTY FIVE AND THIRTY FOUR ARE JUST 73% AND 78% RESPECTIVELY OF THEIR NINETEEN NINETY THREE LEVELS. CONSTRUCTION WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PRIMARILY A CURSE YOU JOINT LABOR MANAGEMENT APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS FUNDED BY EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS FOR EVERY HOUR WORKED THESE UNION AFFILIATED PROGRAMS GRADUATE OVER 90%OF THE STATE'S CONSTRUCTION APPRENTICES. CURRENTLY WE HAVE ABOUT SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND APPEARANCES IN THE STATE ANA APPROVE SYSTEM IN CONSTRUCTION. ARE WE HAVE ACTUALLY REACHED A GOAL THAT'S SMALL IN COMPARISON TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE BUT ITS HISTORICAL IN THE SENSE THAT WE REACH NOW FOR TWO THOUSAND WOMEN IN OUR PARTNERSHIP. SIXTY TO SEVENTY PERCENT- IS THE MINORITY REPRESENTATION. OF THESE APPRENTICES IN THESE PROGRAMS AS WELL. ON THE RESIDENTIAL HOMEBUILDING SECTOR IS ALMOST UNIFORMLY NON UNION THOUGH AND HAS NO SYSTEMATIC WAY TO DEVELOP OR TRAIN ITS WORKFORCE. AND I'LL JUST TRY TO FINISH UP A LITTLE BIT SLOWER BUT MORE. EXPANDING A PRODUCTIVE RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION WORKFORCE AS RAPIDLY AS REQUIRED WILL BE CHALLENGING DUE TO COMPETITION FROM ROCK NONRESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION. IS BASICALLY EMPLOYERS OFFERING HIGHER WAGES AND STRONGER JOB SECURITY. ADDITIONALLY INCREASED CONCENTRATION AND CONTRACTION IN THE HOMEBUILDING SECTOR HA THAT CALIFORNIA WITH FEWER HOMEBUILDING CONTRACTORS EMPLOYING FEWER PEOPLE PERFORM. THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND NON RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION SECTORS HAVE CONSISTENTLY PAID HIGHER WAGES THAN RESIDENTIAL BUILDERS SINCE NINETEEN NINETY. THE WAGE GAP BETWEEN HOMEBUILDING AND NON RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION SECTOR EXCEEDS 40% GROWING PUBLIC INVESTMENT WILL EXERT A STRONG PULL ON CONSTRUCTION MARKETS WITH TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AUTHORIZED AN EXTENSIVE INFRASTRUCTURE AND SUBSIDIZED HOUSING INVESTMENT COMING ONLINE IN MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREAS PROPOSITIONS ONE AND TWO AND OF COURSE OTHER BONTA HAPPEN OUT THERE. SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SIX THE NUMBER OF FIRMS AND MULTI FAMILY RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION IS DOWN BY MORE THAN 33% STATE WIDE WHY EMPLOYMENT IS DOWN BY MORE THAN TWENTY SIX PERCENT. THE AVERAGE FIRM NOW HAS 244% FEWER WORKERS. SO AGAIN CONCENTRATION AND CONTRACTION AMONG HOME BUILDERS IS UNEVEN THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WHILE BAY AREA MULTI FAMILY GENERAL CONTRACTORS HAVE MAINTAIN STABLE NUMBERS AND INCREASE EMPLOYMENT THE NUMBER OF MULTI FAMILY GENERAL CONTRACTORS IN LOS ANGELES SAN DIEGO AND SACRAMENTO. ARE DOWN THIRTY FOUR PERCENT. 51% AND 56% RESPECTIVELY. WITH EVEN STEEPER EMPLOYMENT THE CLIENTS AS CALIFORNIA GRAPPLES WITH POLICY CHOICES TO BUILD ITS WAY OUT OF ITS HOUSING SHORTAGE THE RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION ENTRY MUST PROVIDE DESIRABLE AND STABLE JOBS TO ASSEMBLE A WORKFORCE CAPABLE OF ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM. THE RESIDENTIAL SECTORS LABOR CHALLENGE NECESSITATED HIGHROAD APPROACH BILL AROUND LIVING WAGES AN ONGOING INVESTMENT IN A PARTNERSHIP TO CREATE A STABLE SUPPLY OF SKILLED WORKERS WITH THE FLEXIBILITY TO BUILD HOUSING. AS WELL AS COMMERCIAL AND INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THANK YOU. EACH PROCEDURE YOUR TESTIMONY WILL WAIT IN AND ASK QUESTIONS OF THE PANEL AFTERWARDS. AFTERNOON THAT MADAM CHAIR AND CENTER GLAZIER- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR. CREATING THIS OPPORTUNITY TO DRAW GREATER PUBLIC ATTENTION TO- WHAT WE BELIEVE IS ONE OF THE SINGLE MOST CHALLENGES FACING OUR INDUSTRY- THE SEGMENT REGIONAL BUILDERS EXCHANGE IS MADE UP OF- ELEVEN HUNDRED MEMBER COMPANIES. THAT OPERATE IS GENERAL CONTRACTOR SUBS ARCHITECTS ENGINEERS AND THE PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT SUPPORT THE INDUSTRY. OBVIOUSLY WE RECOGNIZE A CALIFORNIA IS EXPERIENCING HOUSING SHORTAGE BUT EQUALLY WE'RE EXPERIENCING A SKILLED WORKFORCE A SHORTAGE- DURING THE LAST ECONOMIC RECESSION WE LOST TENS OF THOUSANDS OF JOBS- THAT DID NOT. RETURN WIN THE- ECONOMY RECOVERED. AND HAS CREATED A VACUUM OF A RATIO OF FIVE TO ONE SO FOR EVERY. AVERAGE WORKER AROUND FORTY YEARS OF AGE THAT IS SCHEDULED TO RETIRE- OUT OF- THE CONSTRUCTION THE TRADES WE HAVE ONE IN THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. TAKING LOOKING TO TAKE THEIR PLACE AND- THE EFFECTS OF A FLOODED INTO- THE HOUSING MARKET WERE INVENTORY CRUNCH HAS PRECIPITATED- BY THE SKILLED WORK- SHORTAGE- HAS CAUSED DELAYS IT IS BECAUSE- PRICES TO RISE AND FOR MANY CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES ARE FORCED TO PASS UP ON OPPORTUNITIES TO BID. WE'VE SURVEY TO OUR MEMBER COMPANIES AND- THE- THE- THE RESULTS- I THINK- REFLECT BOTH STATEWIDE AND NATIONWIDE OF 8083% OF OUR MEMBERS SAYING THEIR TOP- PRIORITY IS CLOSING THE SKILLED WORKFORCE CAPPER DEFICIT. WE HAVE- SEVERAL PROGRAMS THROUGH OUR EDUCATIONAL FOUNDATION THAT WE HAVE TO SCALE BRINGING OUT TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE STATE SAYS A- STATE TRADE TODAY- THAT WE JUST HELD TWO WEEKS AGO AT THE- EXPOSITION CALIFORNIA FAIR RED DEAD NEARLY TWO THOUSAND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS- THAT- CAME IN- AND- VIEWED US OVER SIXTY VENDORS ARE OR MEMBER COMPANIES THAT SHOWCASE THEIR PARTICULAR TRADE WITH HANDS ON DISPLAYS- AS A WAY TO. GET THE KIDS TO BE EXCITED AND TO LEARN HOW YOU CAN BUILD A SUCCESSFUL CAREER- IN THE CONSTRUCTION WITHOUT THE BURDEN OF STUDENT LOAN DEBT. OBVIOUSLY THE STATE HAS MANY CHALLENGES AHEAD THE GOVERNOR HAS A VERY AMBITIOUS- GOAL THAT HE HAS TASKED US WITH OF BUILDING THREE POINT FIVE MILLION AFFORDABLE HOMES BY THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. AND THE LEGISLATURE HAS PRIORITIZED- IT PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS HIGHER EDUCATION AND K. THROUGH TWELVE- PRESUMABLY IF THE VOTERS PASSED WITH YOUR YOUR- MEASURE AS WELL- FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF EDUCATIONAL FACILITY CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS- SB ONE DOLLARS OF FIVE POINT TWO BILLION- COURTHOUSES DETENTION FACILITIES HOSPITALS. JUSTIN SACRAMENTO ALONE WERE FORECASTING SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS FOR PLANNED DEVELOPMENT. WE CANNOT OUT SOURCE LABOR AND WE CAN ONLY AUTOMATE SO FAR- AND NOT TO SCALE- WE HAVE TO AS A STATE PRIORITIZE CAREER TOWARD A CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WE'VE PARTNERED SUCCESSFULLY WITH. STATE BUILDING TRADES IN CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION- IN TRYING TO. EXPAND THE STATE'S INVESTMENT OF THE CITY GRANT PROGRAM- IN ORDER TO. BRING THAT TO SCALE AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES EXIST TO GROW THE MIDDLE ECONOMY AGAIN WITHOUT STUDENT LOAN DEBT. WE REALLY MUST CHANGE THE NARRATIVE FOR DECADES WE HAVE. CHANNELED MOST YOUNG STUDENTS TO HIGHER EDUCATION- MEANWHILE THE COST OF TUITION FOR HIGHER EDUCATION HAS OUTSTRIPPED- ANY OTHER COMMODITY AND- SOMEHOW THE NARRATIVE HAS BEEN LOST TO THE DECADES THAT CONSTRUCTION IS JUST LOW PAYING DIRTY JOBS AND THAT IS COULD BE FURTHER FROM TE TRUTH THEIR INNOVATIVE THEY'RE EXCITING IN THERE WELL PAYING JOBS- AND WE NEED TO. GET KIDS TO BE EXCITED ABOUT THEM. I HAVE WITH ME I'D LIKE TO SHARE AT LEAST THE BALANCE OF MY TIME- WITH- ONE OF OUR MEMBER COMPANIES BROWN. CONSTRUCTION THEIR CEO RON BROWN. WHO'S BEEN BUILDING SINGLE FAMILY HOMES IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS. FOR LAST- SEVERAL DECADES HE'S THE PRESIDENT CEO OF BROWN CONSTRUCTION. THANK YOU I WILL BE BRIEF AS WE KNOW THAT THE THERE SO I AM RON BROWN PRESENT SEAL BROWN CONSTRUCTION OR MULTI STATE LICENSED CONTRACTOR. BASED HERE IN- SACRAMENTO- WE BUILD PRIMARILY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND- APARTMENTS SENIOR HOUSING SENIOR LIVING WE DO KNOW- A SINGLE FAMILY HOMES. ANYMORE WE'VE BEEN AROUND SINCE THE NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR SO IF. WE KNOW THE TURF A LITTLE BIT- WE KNOW THE PROBLEMS THAT EXIST AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR NUMBER ONE PROBLEM TO DATE IS- SHORTAGES OF LABOR- ACROSS THE BOARD THAT ACCOUNTS FOR. THE HIGHEST COSTS A TRIBUTE TO THE-PROJECTS TO DATE BECAUSE WHAT IT'S DOING IS YOU CAN'T GET LABOR SO THESE AT NIGHT. FOR ALL TRADES AND IT IS INCREASING IN THE PROJECT RATIONS ABOUT A MONTH PER YEAR. SO OUR FEES ALONEABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH. SO YOU CAN SEE WHERE THIS STARTS INCREASING THAT- JOB BECAUSE YOU KNOW JUST. IN UNDER MILLION DOLLARS THESE PROJECTS ARE ALREADY VERY DIFFICULT TO GET FUNDING FOR. SO IT HAS BECOME A BIG PROBLEM OBVIOUSLY AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE BUT. TO MISTER DE IS- QUESTION IS IT OR STATEMENT AS TO THE HOW HOW DO WE DO THIS- I'M VERY INVOLVED WITH- PROFESSOR ANDERSON ISRAEL'S HERE LATER- DEALING WITH THE STUDENT AT THE COLLEGE LEVEL- BUT WE ARE FINDING WE HAVE TO GO. WE GOT A PEEL BACK MUCH LOWER WE GET IT AT THE JUNIOR HIGH WE GOT TO GET THE HIGH SCHOOL AND THERE ARE PROGRAMS IN PLACE- TO HANDLE THIS BUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS WE KNOW. THAT THE TECH CLASSES HAVE BEEN STRIPPED FROM FROM SCHOOLS PARTICULAR CALIFORNIA'S WHAT WE FOUND- SO THE INTRODUCTION INTO TRADES OR WELDING CARPENTRY THIS SIMPLE TOOL USAGE HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM A LOT OF THESE- POTENTIAL. EMPLOYEES AND- AND THEY'VE BEEN FORCED TO GO TO THE COLLEGE DIRECTION I MEAN I RI SIX CHILDREN I DID THE SAME THING I'M A GUILTY PARTY I CAME UP THROUGH THE TRADES AND ALSO WENT TO COLLEGE AND I SAID. HEY THEY CAN NEVER TAKE THE COLLEGE. DEGREE AWAY FROM ME GET THE COLORS AGREE AND MICHAEL. I'M NOT GET DOESN'T ON THE COLLEGES BUT- YOU KNOW I DID A DISADVANTAGE TO SOME OF MY KIDS NOT REALLY SPEND A LOT OF TIME WITH THEM TO. BRING THEM UP THROUGH THE TRAITS AND HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS NOW I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RECRUIT ONE OF FROM BACK IN BUT- THE OTHER FIVERR OFF TO OTHER THINGS THAT ARE MORE ATTRACTIVE IN THEIR MIND. THE BE THE TRAITS IS AS YOU AS YOU'VE HEARD. THERE IN ONE AN INDIVIDUAL CAN MAKE FIFTY EIGHT DOLLARS AN HOUR THAT'S- PRETTY GOOD LIVING IN MY ESTIMATION- AND ISSUE COMMENTED THE TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS THAT'S AN ACCURATE STATEMENT TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR. AND WE DO A LOT OF WORK FRESNO AND THAT CLOVIS THAT AREA FOR DOUBLE HOUSING AND SENIOR SPECIFICALLY SENIOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND TRADESPEOPLE IN THOSE AREAS AND SO ANYWAY I'M HERE TO PLEAD FOR. ANYTHING AN OFFER ANYTHING WE CAN DO. WERE POISED AND READY TO DO IT AS I SAID WE'RE VERY INVOLVED AT THE UNIVERSITY LEVEL- BUT IT NEEDS TO GET LOWER AND I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE IN FUNDING BEING PUSHED INTO THE- AT LEAST THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL FOR. AND TRADE SPEED. MORE COURAGE THAN TALK ABOUT THE GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY HOW MUCH PLEASURE THANK YOU FOR THE TIME. DURING I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR- CENTER GLAZER- FOR SOFTBALL I WANT TO SAY THAT I'M HONORED THAT YOU'RE ON THE STATE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD THANK YOU- AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH YOU. ON THIS AND OTHER OTHER SUBJECTS ARE WORKFORCE- I WANTED TO START BY- ADDRESSING THE FUTURE WORK QUESTION BECAUSE THE INTRODUCTION TO THE HEARING WAS SO WELL WRITTEN- I- WITH A STAFF PERSON IF HE'S HERE PETER BUT HE'S A REALLY NICE JOB TRAILER. DOES FOR YOU DO EVERYTHING RIGHT. OF ONE IMPORTANT- I THINK LEVEL SETTING I POINT MADE BY THE FUTURE WORK COMMISSION IS OUT- HAD THREE FULL DAYS OF HEARINGS- IS THAT MARKETS ARE GOVERNED BY NATURAL LAW- THEY'RE ACTUALLY GOVERN MOSTLY BY SOCIAL NORMS CHOICES MADE BY KEY MARKET ACTORS BUSINESSES LABOR COMMUNITIES WORKERS- CONSUMERS ARE AND I WOULD GET BACK TO THAT AT THE END BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S AN IMPORTANT- CONVERSATION IT HAS TO BE HAD ABOUT HOW YOU HELPED TO SHAPE OF THE WORK FORCE THE LABOR MARKETING CONSTRUCTION NOT JUST TODAY BUT FOR THE FUTURE- THEY WERE INDEED A SHORTAGE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING CALIFORNIA- EVERYBODY AGREES- BUT IT'S NOT A SKILLS PROBLEM NECESSARILY OR SUCH JUSTICE SKILLS PROBLEM SO I DON'T THINK THE WORK FORCE. ANSWER IS THE IS THE RIGHT ONE BY ITSELF. YOU WERE WORKERS ARE CHOOSING RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION- WE'VE HEARD THAT MANY TIMES- IS FOR SEVERAL REASONS ONE IS THAT. WE'RE A FULL EMPLOYMENT ECONOMY I AND JOB SEEKERS HAVE A LOT OF OTHER OPTIONS NOW- I TALKED TO A TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLDS RECENTLY. WHO STARTED IN AS A RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION WORKER CARPENTER- DOINGS OF FRAMING AND STACKING. TWO YEARS AGO WHEN HIS TWENTY TWO YEARS OLD AND WORKED HIS WAY UP TO TWENTY DOLLARS AN HOUR WENT TO THE CANNABIS JOB FAIR. SPONSORED BY THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT RECENTLY I GOT A CALL BACK- IN IS NOW WORKING IN IN A DISPENSARY IN SACRAMENTO MAKING THIRTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR- BUT FOR HIM IT'S SAFER IT'S INSIDE OF YOU DON'T GET SPLINTERS THE SIZE OF TWO BY FOURS- IN YOUR BODY- BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT AFTER A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS A PROBATION. HIS WAGES ARE GONNA GO UP AND HE'S GOING TO BE A CARD CARRYING MEMBER OF THE OF YOUR C. W. LOCAL EIGHT NEWS GONNA HAVE BENEFITS AND HE'S GOING TO HAVE A RETIREMENT PLAN. OF YOUNG PEOPLE ARE MAKING THESE CHOICES ALL THE TIME AND I THINK THIS IS REALLY HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE AVAILABILITY OF WORKERS IN IS IDENTICAL CONSTRUCTION SPECIFICALLY. I'M. I THINK WE'VE TALKED ABOUT. HERE THE SALES ARE POINTED OUT IN TERMS OF THE QUALITY WORKING RESIDENTS RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION. WORK IS VERY VOLATILE SO IT'S DIFFICULT TO GET HOURS- THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED- THE OTHER WILL BUG JOB QUALITY ISSUES IN RESIDENTIAL. RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AS WELL- WAIT STAFF TO STILL A BIG PROBLEM THERE- IT IS STILL DANGEROUS WORK- SO I WANNA TALK ABOUT APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS AND WHAT WE'RE DOING THE STATE LEVEL- THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD. TO ADDRESS. WHAT I THINK ADDRESS RESIDENTIAL- CHALLENGE BUT WHAT WE'RE DOING MOSTLY COMMERCIAL PUBLIC WORKS. THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF INTEREST. IN A PARTNERSHIP OF FOR STATE APPROVED A PARTITION IN THE BUILDING TRADES. I AS YOU KNOW THE TRADES RUN ROBUST APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS IS THE GOLD STANDARD IN TRAINING FOR THE WORK FORCE THEM- WE WANT TO GET PEOPLE INTO. A PATHWAY IT. IT TO STATE APPROVED A PARTNERSHIP PARTICULARLY THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES BECAUSE THEY OFFER LONG TERM KERR IS IT PAY WELL AND BENEFITS. OF PEOPLE RETIRE IN THOSE JOBS. IT'S NOT THE SAME IN RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION. I BELIEVE AND I THINK THE DATA BEARS THIS OUT IF JOB QUALITY WAS IMPROVED A RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION. I THINK YOU WOULDN'T HAVE AS BIG A PROBLEM IN TERMS OF RECRUITING PEOPLE- OUR CHALLENGE FROM A WORKFORCE PERSPECTIVE. I IS ACCESS TO STATE APPROVED APPRENTICESHIP FOR WORKERS FROM DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. WE ARE AIM AT THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD. TO DEVELOP PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMITTEE BASED ORGANIZATION SCHOOLS A WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD'S SO WE CAN GET A DIRECT PATHWAYS IN THE STATE APPROVED APPRENTICESHIP- THESE PROGRAMS THAT TARGET THE POPULATIONS WE WANT TO SEE- WE WANT TO MOVE THE NEEDLE ON IN TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT- THAT MEANS. FORMALLY PEOPLE WHO ARE FORMING COURSE RATED JUSTICE INVOLVED- AS WELL AS WOMEN IN THE TRADES BUT ALL KINDS OF BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT. THE JOINT. APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING PROGRAMS IN THE TRADES. ARE IS ONE. IT WILL THE TRACES WHERE THAT THE TRAINING IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING IN THE JOINT TRAINING PROGRAMS I THINK SAYS ARE POINTED THIS OUT OF THE SEVENTY THOUSAND. APPRENTICES AND IN CONSTRUCTION 93% OR IN JOINT LABOR MANAGEMENT- PROGRAMS. SO FROM POLICY PERSPECTIVE WE'RE TRYING TO HELP MOVE PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY INTO INTO GOOD JOBS WE ONE HITTER WAGON TO WITH THE TRAINING IS WITHTHE JOB WHERE THE JOB QUALITY IS. AND WHERE THE GOLD STANDARD IS IN TRAINING- WE ARE INVESTING THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD. IN REGIONAL MULTI CRAFT PRE PARTNERSHIP PARTNERSHIPS. ACROSS THE STATE IT'S CALLED A HIGH ROAD CONSTRUCTION CAREERS IT'S A NEW INITIATIVE IT'S ABOUT NOT NEW IT'S FOUR YEARS OLD- WE HAVE TWELVE CURRENT PARTNERSHIPS. THAT INCLUDE BUILDING TRADES COUNCILS MULTIPLE CRASS. A WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD'S CAN BASE ORGANIZATIONS COLLEGES AND SCHOOLS. FUNDING FROM SB ONE IS GONNA HELP EXPAND THAT- THAT WORK AROUND THE STATE KNOWS PARTNERSHIPS OF MORE PEOPLE GET TRAINED. GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND DOLLARS- WE'RE JUST TARGETED- TO THE SAME PROGRAM TO EXPAND EVEN MORE ACROSS THE STATE IS LARGELY THOUGH GOING TO CONNECT TO PUBLIC WORKS IN COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE. MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN STATE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS ARE GOING TO WORK- SO BACK TO. SHAPING THE FUTURE WORK. TO INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF WORKERS IN RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION I THINK CONTRACTORS WHO WERE SKILLED STRAITS PEOPLE FRUSTRATED STATE APPROVED APPRENTICESHIPS. THESE PROGRAMS CAN RAMP UP TO MEET DEMAND- THEY'VE SHOWN OVER AND OVER AGAIN THEY CAN RAMP UP IN THE COULD RAMP DOWN- WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE MODEL OF YOU PROBABLY KNOW- OF- TRAINING IN THE TRADES IN THE DISPATCH MODEL. THE DETACHED NATURE. NEGOTIATED COMMITTEE WORKFORCE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN CONTRACTORS IN THE TRADES. CAN HAVE THE ADDED SOCIAL. PULLING NEW APPRENTICES. FROM THESE MULTI CRAFT FREE PRINTER PROGRAMS THAT TARGET DISADVANTAGED POPULATIONS. SO MORE WORKERS FROM DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WE GET. QUALITY OF HIGHWAYS CRUISING CONSTRUCTION. INCREASE A VIRTUOUS CYCLE IF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS BUILT. BY WORKERS WHO LIVE IN THE COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY CONSTRUCTION IS HAPPENING- THOSE SAME WORKERS CAN AFFORD TO LIVE IN THE NEW HOUSING. THOSE HIGH WAGES FUEL THE COMMUNITIES ECONOMICS NOT JUST IN THE SHORT TERM BUT POSSIBLY FOR GENERATIONS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WOULD JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE. I UNDERSTOOD BECAUSE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT I'VE HEARD. THE CONNECTION. QUITE SO STARKLY BETWEEN THE STATE APPROVED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS AND- AND HOUSING BUT WHEN I HEARD YOU SAY THAT NINETY 596% ARE NOT. IN HOUSING THERE IN PLAAF. PROJECTS WHAT NOT 93% OF ALL APPRENTICES IN THE STATE ARE IN JOINT LABOR MANAGEMENT TRAINING PROGRAMS- AND THOSE APPRENTICESHIPS THEIR STATE APPROVED ARE DISPATCHING WORKERS PRIMARILY TO PUBLIC WORKS IN COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION NOT RESIDENTIAL. THAT'S THAT'S AND THAT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW NEW BECAUSE THEN WHAT. AT AS THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT IS THAT. THAT HOUSING CONSTRUCTION IS NOT BENEFITING THOSE PROGRAMS. AND IT'S PROBABLY WHY YOU SEE THAT HI A WAGE THEFT ISSUE AND SOME OF THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY ISSUES THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT FOR YEARS THAT'S CORRECT AND JUST TO ADD ONE MORE POINT. STATE REPRESSION PROGRAMS OFFER REQUIRE RIGOROUS SAFETY TRAINING- WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND A SUB SECTOR OF CONSTRUCTION THAT IS RELATIVELY RELATIVELY DANGERS. RIGHT THAT'S TRUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT KIND OF CASH PATIENT. THANK YOU SO MUCH CARE AND CENTER CENTER GLAZER- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CONVENING THIS THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND I REALLY APPRECIATED HEARING ALL OF YOUR PERSPECTIVES AND KNOWLEDGE ON THIS SSUE. SO I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE OPPORTUNITY OF INVESTING IN GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE MEANING ALSO INVESTING IN THAT WORK FORCE AS NEEDED TO BUILD THAT INFRASTRUCTURE. THE TRANSITION AWAY FROM A CARBON INTENSIVE ECONOMY MEANS BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WILL TRANSFORM COMMUNITIES AND THAT INCLUDES INCREASING ACCESS TO SAFE AFFORDABLE AND HEALTHY HOUSING. AND ALSO SUPPORTING THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO STRENGTHEN THE ENTIRE COMMUNITIES TO BE MORE RESILIENT TO THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE THAT ARE BEING FELT RIGHT NOW. ADAPTING TO NEW NORMALS LIKE MORE FREQUENT EXTREME WEATHER AND RESOURCE SCARCITY BY MAKING BUILDINGS AND INFRASTRUCTURE GENERALLY MORE EFFICIENT AND RELIABLE. AND MAINTAINING A HEALTHY A SUSTAINABLE AND HEALTHY LIVING ENVIRONMENT THAT PROTECTS AIR AND WATER QUALITY AND ALSO ACCESS TO NECESSITIES LIKE HEALTHY FOOD. AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF TRANSPORTATION THAT WORKS FOR PEOPLE OF ALL AGES AND ABILITIES. WATER AND ENERGY EFFICIENT HOUSING SUPPORTS COMFORTABLE AND HEALTHY LIVING CONDITIONS AND SHOULD ALWAYS BE A PRIORITY IN HOUSING PROJECTS AND BEYOND THE HOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR NEW OR UPGRADED INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING UTILITIES. SIDEWALKS PASS ACCESS TO GREEN SPACE AND PARKS AXIS NEARBY JOBS GROCERY STORES EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. ALL OF THESE THINGS THAT I JUST MENTIONED REQUIRE A WORK FORCE TO BUILD THIS HEALTHY AND SAFE AND SUSTAINABLE FUTURE. PAIRING UPGRADING EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY SAFETY AND AFFORDABILITY IS ALSO AN AREA WHERE THERE IS A WORKFORCE NEED IN ORDER TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES HAPPEN. BUILDING MORE HOUSING ALSO MEANS THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE LONGSTANDING CHALLENGES OF UPGRADING AND REHABILITATING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS HIGHER DENSITIES DENSITY DEVELOPMENT. SO FOR EXAMPLE GRAY INFRASTRUCTURE- SO THESE TYPES OF THINGS HAVE HAVE TO BE UPGRADED IN MANY REGIONS OF THE STATE TO MEET DEMANDS OF INCREASED CAPACITY BUT ALSO TO INCREASE- OR TO MEET THE INCREASING EXPECTATIONS OF STORM WATER FLOW DO YOU TO SEE LEVEL RISE OR- ABOVE AVERAGE RAINFALL EVENTS THAT AFFECT DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE STATE MORE FREQUENTLY. GRAY WATER INCLUDE THINGS LIKE PIPES TOM SWISS REGIMENT PLANS BUT SHOULD BE COMPLIMENTED WITH THAT GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE COMPONENT. SO DO YOU KNOW TO IN ORDER TO REDUCE THAT THE RUNOFF QUANTITY BUT ALSO INCREASE WATER QUALITY. SO THINGS LIKE GREEN ROOFS BIO SWELLS PERMEABLE PAVEMENT CONSTRUCTED A RESTORED WETLANDS OF IN RIPARIAN HABITAT CETERA ALL OF THESE THINGS CAN HELP TO RELIEVE STRESS ON THE SYMPTOMS ARE ON THE SYSTEMS. AND WILL ALSO SUPPORT THAT ADDITIONAL HOUSING AND CREATE THOSE RESILIENT COMMUNITIES TO SUPPORT A GOOD QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THE WORKERS WHO LIVE N THOSE COMMUNITIES- SKILLED WORKERS ARE ALSO NEEDED TO UPDATE OUR TRANSPORTATION I'M A MILK MOBILITY INFRASTRUCTURE IN ORDER TO SUPPORT- YOU KNOW SAFE AND SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS. IN THOSE COMMUNITIES WHERE- WE ARE WE ARE BUILDING IT AND DIGITAL HOUSING UNITS MAKING IT SAFER FOR KIDS TO WALK TO SCHOOL. FOR PEOPLE TO BIKE OR WALK TO WORK IF THEY'RE ABLE. AND NOT TO MENTION SAVING LIVES OF THOSE WHO ARE TRAVELING ALONG THIS AND SAFE ROADS THAT DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT ABILITY OTHER THAN CARS. THE REASON I MENTION THIS IS BECAUSE WHERE WE BUILD HOUSING WE HAVE TO ALSO CONSIDER THE NEED FOR BUILDING THIS COMPLETE STREETS AND- BIKE PATHS BEST RAN BY. PATHWAYS AND ACCESS TO LOCAL PUBLIC TRANSIT- WE A PARKING RIGHTS THINGS F THAT NATURE. REPRESENTING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT TO HELP US TO REACH THOSE GOALS AND TO ALSO HELP OUR WORKERS. GET TO WORK SAFELY. THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THE APPROACH TO ADDRESSING EACH OF THESE ISSUES I'VE MENTIONED WILL VARY GREATLY THROUGHOUT THE STATE. HOUSING IS NEEDED ALMOST EVERY AREA OF THE STATE. AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD HOUSING THAT IS LOCALLY APPROPRIATE. AND DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE TO DISPLACEMENT AND ALSO SUPPORTS THE HEALTHY AND QUALITY OF WHAT A GOOD QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THOSE WHO LIVE THERE. ONE OF THE NEW NORMALS THAT MANY COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITH IS THE NEED TO REBUILD AFTER NATURAL DISASTERS. LIKE THE WILD FIRES THAT HAVE TAKEN THE LIVES AND HOMES OF OUR FRIENDS FAMILY OR CO WORKERS. CALIFORNIA'S LONG WILDFIRE. SEASON THREATENS HOMES AND COMMUNITIES EVEN TODAY AS WE. SPEAK AND IN THOSE REGIONS OF THE STATE- THAT ARE AFFECTED BY THESE HAZARDS THAT ARE FUELED BY THE CLIMATE CRISIS. BUILDERS ARE BECOMING REBUILDERS. AND WITH THESE MORE FREE GET FREQUENT AND WIDESPREAD NATURAL DISASTERS WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT REBUILDING WITH THE SAFETY AND THE HEALTH OF THE SURVIVORS IN MIND. AND THAT MEANS TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION FUTURE THREATS OF NATURAL DISASTERS AND RESOURCE SCARCITY. AND RELIABILITY WHEN REBUILDING HOMES NEIGHBORHOODS AND ENTIRE COMMUNITIES. THE STATE CAN LEAD BY EXAMPLE THROUGH PROCUREMENT BY PRIORITIZING SUSTAINABILITY OF PROCUREMENT THE GUIDES THE WAY THE STATE PLANS BUILDS MANAGES OPERATES AND MAINTAINS BUILDINGS- UPDATING THE BILL AND BUILDING NEW BUILDINGS IS A MAJOR UP. OPPORTUNITY FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT TO SUPPORT THOSE PROJECTS AND- I ALSO WANTED TO TALK ABOUT KIND OF WHO IS PART OF THE GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE WORK FORCE BECAUSE I THINK. THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NEEDED TO MEET THESE GOALS. SO THE SECTORS THAT WILL DRIVE OUR TRANSITION TO A CLEANER ECONOMY INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE CONSTRUCTION LANDSCAPING URBAN FORESTRY ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION. WASTE WATER AND MORE AND SOME EXAMPLES OF THE SKILLED WORKERS NEEDED FOR THE SECTOR IS OUR ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING TECHNICIANS FOREST AND CONSERVATION TECHNICIANS. CEMENT MASONS CONCRETE FINISHERS CONSTRUCTION LABOR IS OPERATING ENGINEERS AND CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT OPERATORS HI PLAYERS REFERS CONSTRUCTING A BUILDING INSPECTOR IS JUST TO NAME A FEW SPECIFIC ONES BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. TO BE EXPLICIT ABOUT THE TYPES OF JOBS THAT WE NEED TO SUPPORT IN ORDER TO MEET OUR CLEAN ECONOMY IN CLEAN ENERGY GOALS. AND WE HAVE TO WORK TOWARDS NORMALIZING AND MAKING AVAILABLE THE OPTION FOR PEOPLE TO PURSUE SKILLED A SKILLED TRADE CAREER AS IS MENTIONED A FEW TIMES. PROGRAMS LIKE APPRENTICESHIPS THE LAB PEOPLE TO WORK AND STUDY. FOR YOU KNOW TO WORK TOWARDS A SKILLED TRADE CAREER WHILE HAVING THAT PREDICTABILITY OF KNOWING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A JOB WHEN THEY COMPLETE THAT PROGRAM. AND NOT JUST A JOB AT A WELL PAID AND STABLE JOB. SO JUST TO NAME A FEW SOLUTIONS AND SORT OF IDEAS AND HOW THE STATE CAN WORK TO ACCOMPLISH THESE MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE OBJECTIVES THAT WILL HELP US TO SHIFT AWAY FROM A CARBON INTENSIVE ECONOMY- THINGS LIKE SUPPORTING EXISTING EFFORTS AND PROVIDING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. TRAINING AND EDUCATION TO ALL PEOPLE WITH A FOCUS ON FRONTLINE AND VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. WRECKING INVESTMENTS TO SPUR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WILL ALSO PRIORITIZING FOR HIGH QUALITY JOB CREATION. POLICIES THAT STRENGTHEN WORKERS ABILITIES TO BUILD SUSTAINABLE CAREERS. AND INVESTMENT IN JOB TRAINING JUST TO NAME A FEW- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE BEING PART OF THIS CONVERSATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I YOU- YOU MAKE GOOD POINTS IN TERMS OF SOME OF THAT. THE JOB CLASSIFICATIONS THAT I HADN'T REALLY EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT IN TERMS OF. IN THE CHANGING. THE CHANGING INTEREST IN FOCUSING ON ON- GREEN. AND KIND OF THE TRANSITIONS FROM URBAN TO RURAL AND- THE INTERESTING VERY GOOD WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY WILL SEE IF- CENTER GLAZER HAS ANY QUESTIONS. GO AHEAD. THANK YOU CHAIR I CABALLERO OUT I APPRECIATE THE EXPERTISE AROUND THE TABLE- AND CERTAINLY YOU'VE DONE A GOOD JOB OF EXPLAINING- THIS KOREAN NOT THAT WE ARE LIVING WITH THEM- AT HI WHO CAN ARGUE WITH THE IMPORTANCE OF A SKILLED WORKFORCE- THE ISSUE OF WAGES LIVING WAGES HOUSING AFFORDABILITY- AND CERTAINLY GREEN CONSTRUCTION I MEAN ALL THOSE THINGS IN A MATCH UP WITH A NO THE VALUES THAT WE HAVE FOR WHAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE AN OUT GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA- BUT THEY DO COME INTO CONFLICT- BUT EVEN IN ADDITION TO THOSE THINGS THAT YOU'VE IDENTIFIED TODAY. YOU KNOW WE HAVE SUPPLY COST PEOPLE HAVEN'T TALKED MUCH ABOUT THAT WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT UTILITY COSTS WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT FEES. IT'S GOOD THAT WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT ZONING BECAUSE WE HAVE ANOTHER HEARING AND I THINK HE WANTED TO GET INTO THAT TODAY NOT TODAY. BUT THERE'S SO MANY OTHER THINGS OF THAT HAVE HAVE CREATED THIS NOT THAT WE LIVE WITH AND TODAY AND- I DO THINK THAT. AND I KNOW WHAT THE NEXT FILES GOING TO FOCUS ON THIS A LITTLE BIT SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING THEIR THOUGHTS BUT- THAT EDUCATION TRAINING REALLY ARE THE KEY. AT SOME LEVEL IT'S ALL ABOUT ECONOMICS AND IT'S ABOUT SUPPLY AND DEMAND. AND YOU KNOW I HEARD I HEARD A FACT- ALLEGEDLY A FAX WOULD LIKE TO GET GET YOUR REACTIONS TO IT. IS IT THAT. I WAS TOLD THAT THERE ARE. FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND APPROVED. HOUSING UNITS IN CALIFORNIA TODAY. NO WAY OUT. ZONING ISSUE NO SECRET ISSUE THESE ARE APPROVED UNITS- AND THEY'RE NOT BEING BUILT ON AND I KNOW THAT IN MY DISTRICT. I HAVE A NUMBER OF PARCELS THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED FOR THOUSANDS OF UNITS AND THEY'RE NOT GETTING BILLED. SO THEY ACQUIRE ASIAN THAT THE THOSE LANDOWNERS OUR DEVELOPERS ARE FACING. THAT INVESTMENT THE RISKS THE REWARDS JUST NOT THERE FOR LOTS OF THE REASONS IN WHICH YOU GUYS HAVE JUST CRIED RIGHT. ALTHOUGH THERE SOME OF THEM ARE IN CONFLICT WOULD WE LIKE TO PAY MORE OF COURSE. BUT THEN WHAT ABOUT THE ISSUE AFFORDABILITY SO THAT THAT'S THIS NOT THAT WE ARE LIVING WITHIN WE'D LIKE TO HAVE EVERYBODY ABSOLUTE REUSS OF COURSE. NOW RAISING COSTS. SO IT IS AN INTERESTING KIND OF NOT THAT WE ARE LIVING IN TODAY AND HOW WE GET OUT OF IT. AND GET OUT OF THE BASIC ECONOMICS WHICH IS THAT- IF WE DON'T HAVE THAT. YEAH THE SUPPLY. IT'S GOING TO AFFECT THE DEMAND. AND VICE VERSA AND SO. I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN ANY REACTION TO THE IDEA THAT- IS THE FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND APPROVE UNITS JUST UNDERSCORE WHAT YOU HAVE SAID. WE'RE NOT PAYING ENOUGH. WE'RE NOT HAVING A SKILLED ENOUGH- WE- THAT THAT THAT REALLY ALL FEEDS IN THE SAME PLACE. THAT'S THAT'S REALLY THE- THE DILEMMA QUESTION WHICH I KNOW YOU'RE WRESTLING WITH TO. I THINK YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD AS FAR AS- EXAMINING. THIS ISSUE OR THIS DILEMMA IN A HOLISTIC MANNER OBVIOUSLY. LUXURY AND HIGHER AND HOMES ARE BEING BUILT BECAUSE THERE'S A MARKET FOR THEM AND- MORE AFFORDABLE HOMES ARE UNFORTUNATELY GETTING PASSED UP BECAUSE THEY DON'T PENCIL OUT. THERE ARE. IN MANY CIRCUMSTANCES. THERE ARE PROJECTS- THAT MEMBER EARLIEST- CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES- ARE HAVING TO FOCUS ON ON ONE SECTOR AND AT THE RISK OR AT LEAST- JEOPARDIZING OTHERS. OBVIOUSLY LABOR IS 2025% OF CONSTRUCTION OF THE HOME AND THAT'S A HUGE SEGMENT- THERE ARE- ENTITLEMENT COSTS THERE ARE NON UTILITY IMPACT FEES WHICH CALIFORNIA. TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE THOUSAND WHICH IS TWICE AS MUCH THE TO NEIGHBORING STATES. ALL OF THESE COSTS- ADD UP ON TOP OF EACH OTHER AND EVERY MONTH WE PROBABLY INCREASED BY ABOUT A PERCENTAGE POINT- AND THEN YOU. SNOWBALL THAT INTO TERRACE AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT ARE UNCONTROLLABLE. FOR EVERY THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU INCREASE THE COST OF A HOME YOU'VE KEPT THAT HOME OUT OF REACH FOR FIFTEEN THOUSAND FAMILIES. AND WELL THAT'S A PART OF IT. WE NEED TO LOOK AT A BUILDING HOMES AT ALL LEVELS AND ALL SCALES AND. WHETHER THOSE THOSE HOMES ARE. BELOW YOU KNOW 50% AM I OR IF THEY'RE ABOVE YOU KNOW THE YOU KNOW A OR FOR INSTANCE HAS GOT A ONE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLAR AVERAGE AVERAGE LUXURY CONDO. YOU HAVE THE STILL THE SAME PEOPLE SWING IN THE HAMMERS AND OPERATING THE HEAVY MACHINERY. UP AND IN LESS WE LOOK AT THIS UPSTREAM AND INVEST IN CHANGING THAT NARRATIVE IN GETTING KIDS. EXCITED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITIES OF A CAREER IN CONSTRUCTION AGAIN WITHOUT COLLEGE DEBT- THEN THESE. PROJECTS ARE GONNA CONTINUE TO GO. ON BUILT OR DELAYED ATADDITIONAL COST- IN AND THEY'LL JUST BE SITTING IDLY- IN MEANWHILE WILL JUST BE. WAITING AND HOPING SO I JUST OFFER THAT. UNLIKE THE ADELANTO WOOD MISTER CONKLIN- THIS SAID ON THEE ARE MANY FACTORS WERE WHILE OTHERS PERHAPS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITS ARE APPROVED IN AND NOT GETTING READY TO BUILD. UP COST MAY BE A FACTOR WILL DEFINITELY SEE THE POINT HAVING ACCESS TO- A SKILLED LABOR FORCE TO ACCOMPLISH THE PRODUCT PROJECT WITH PRODUCTION EFFICIENCIES. CAN ALSO RELATE TO THAT- BUT WE MISSED ONE POINT AND WHAT YOU SAID CENTER AND THAT'S PROFITS. RIGHT WHOCONTROLS THE PROFITS AND THE TIMING OF THE CONSTRUCTION ONCE YOU RECEIVE THE ENTITLEMENT. AND THAT IS A KEY COMPONENT OF THIS AND SO WE. CONTINUE TO STRESS THE FACT THAT THIS IS A CONGRESS SAID THERE IS A LUXURY CONSTRUCTION A MARKET RATE SORT OF SPEAK PRODUCTION. OUT THERE BUT WHAT'S MISSING IS THAT. AFFORDABLE HOUSING THE OF THOSE PROJECTS THAT CONTINUE TO BE IN NEED OF SUBSIDIES. HAVING A SORT OF A PUBLIC PRIVATE TYPE PARTNERSHIP WITH THERE IS A PUBLICLY SUBSIDIZED LIKE WHAT WAS AN ARTY GAZE FOR EXAMPLE A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT HAD THE WORKFORCE PROTECTIONS ADDRESS THAT ISSUE IT DID PROVIDE A LOT OF UNITS AND PERHAPS THE INVENTORY TO. BE IN COMPETITION SOME OF THOSE HOMES WITH PRICE ABILITIES WERE ALSO THERE- THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK THAT OF LEGISLATORS ARE GRAPPLING WITH HOW TO ADDRESS THAT SORT OF NOT ONLY THE REGULATORY REFORM SO YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BUT ALSO TO STRIKE WHEN THERE IS GONNA BE THE SOURCE% SITUATION WHERE THE ECONOMY DIPS. THINGS CONTRACT AND DEVELOPERS ARE NOT GOING TO BUILD BECAUSE THE PROFITS ARE NOT THERE FOR THEM AND SO THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN CONTROL YOU CAN CONTROL IN THE SENSE THAT YOU COULD PROVIDE PUBLIC SUBSIDIES WITH STRONG CONDITIONS TO BILL THE TYPE OF HOUSING THAT A LOT OF WORKERS NEED TODAY. I MEAN WE'RE SEEING THE PRICES GO UP A WE'RE ALSO NOT SEEING THE WAGES GO UP THE ACTUALLY THE DRESS THAT I TRY TO ACTUALLY GO ON AND BE- ELIGIBLE TO BUY A HOME IN TODAY'S ECONOMY AND SO IF YOU'RE ABLE TO. SUBSIDIZE IT CONDITION IT ADDRESS THE WORKFORCE ISSUES I THINK YOU CAN HAVE THAT COUNTER CYCLICAL RESPONSE TO THAT. SO IF I HAVE A AT MANAGER RESPONSE AYE AYE I SUPPORTED THAT WAS CENTER BILLS WELL WAS IT SB FIVE YEAH I SUPPORTED THAT AND I'VE SUPPORTED RDAS AND- I THINK GOVERNOR BROWN ACTED NOT OUT OF THAT LACK OF INTEREST IN. AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT OUT OF THE BUDGET CRISIS HE WAS FACING BUT. AND I AND I AND I AND IN OUR BUDGET THIS YEAR WE'VE DONE A LOT TO TRY TO SUBSIDIZE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND I'VE BEEN SUPPORTER OF THAT AND THE SENATE HAS BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF THAT. BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT THAT IS NOT GONNA BE THAT THAT'S A SMALL PART OF HOW GETTING OUR WAY THROUGH THE SUPPLY PROBLEM THAT REALLY IS I MEAN. I'D LOVE SOME ECONOMISTS TALK ABOUT THE BIG PICTURE OF HAVE OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITS AND HOW MANY. EVEN THE BILLIONS THAT WE'RE SPENDING WITHIN GOVERNMENT ARE GOING TO CONTRIBUTE TO THAT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND I THINK I'D BE PRETTY SMALL BUT I'D LOOK FOR THE EXPERTS TO GUIDE US ON THAT. THAT'S THAT'S THE DILEMMA THOUGH RIGHT I MEAN SO IT'S A PEOPLE WE'RE ALL WE'RE DOING IS DOING LITTLE THINGS NOT THAT THERE AREN'T IMPORTANT DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME- BUT THEY ARE SMALL IN TERMS OF THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE FACING- THERE WAS A STORY TODAY- THESE TWO WAS ONLINE. TODAY BY CAL MATTERS. ABOUT A DIFFERENT FORM OF CONSTRUCTION- MY THE MODULAR UNITS IS THAT THE RIGHT FOR HOW THEY REFER TO THEM FACTORY BUILT WITH. AND I'M SURE THERE'S SOME ISSUES ABOUT THE WORK FORCE THERE AND WHAT THEY'RE BEING PAID. WHICH IS A LEGITIMATE QUESTION- BUT IN REGARD TO BUILDING IT FASTER AND CHEAPER WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE DYNAMIC I GET THAT OFF. I KNOW WHY THE LUXURY HOMES ARE STILL HAPPENING. BUT THAT'S REALLY ALMOST A SIDE ISSUE TO WHAT WE HAD GOT WHAT CAN WE AND GOVERNMENT DO. THE CHANGE THIS EQUATION TO GET OUT OF THIS COURTNEY AND LOT THAT NOT THAT WE'RE FACING. NO REALLY AND WE HAVE TO DO IT IN A BIG WAY IT'S NOT A LITTLE WAY I MEAN THERE'S A REASON. THE ASPIRATIONAL GOALS OF THE GOVERNOR WHICH WE ALL APPRECIATE AND ADMIRE. LET'S BE CLEAR IT'S FALLING FLAT BECAUSE BUT WHAT DO WE DO THIS YEAR. TO ACTUALLY ADVANCE THAT IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY AND WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE BUDGET. AUGMENTATIONS AND THE REST WHICH ARE VALUABLE AND KNOCKS. THAT'S NOT REALLY. CONFRONTING THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU GUYS TALKING ABOUT HERE WHETHER IT'S ABOUT. THIS SKILLED WORKFORCE THE WAGE TO THE AFFORDABILITY SO REALLY HOW DO WE BREAK IT DOWN IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY I THINK IT'S GETTING EVERYBODY OUT OF THEIR COMFORT ZONE AT SOME LEVEL. BUT WE HAVE TO JUST BE WE HAVE TO BE HONEST ABOUT IT. IS THE BIG PROBLEM IS SIMPLE EITHER BIG ACTIONS OR SIGNIFICANT. ACTIONS OVER A PERIOD OF TIME TO REALLY GET OUT OF IT. THIS IS THE DILEMMA WE. FIND I THINK I THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE AND I AM. I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT THE STEPS ARE THAT WE NEED TO TAKE BUT THE M. I'VE BEEN TALKING TO A LOT OF PEOPLE OVER THIS OVER THE INTERIM. AND. I THINK IT'S GONNA TAKE RETHINKING HOW WE HOW WE HOUSE PEOPLE AND PART OF THAT IS UNDERSTANDING THAT. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IN IN MY COMMUNITY- THE RENTS IN SALINAS IN OUR THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A THREE BEDROOM HOME THREE BEDROOM TWO BATH HOME. AND WHEN YOU'RE MEDIAN INCOME IS SOMEWHERE AROUND FORTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS- YOU HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT EARNING MUCH LESS. AND. AND THAT THREE BEDROOM HOUSE WILL BE RENTED BY THREE FAMILIES THAT EACH SHARE A BEDROOM AND THEN- AND EVERYTHING ELSE WHICH MEANS ARE PROBABLY FIVE OR SIX CARS. THAT DON'T FIT IN THE DRIVEWAY THEY'RE STARTING TO CLOG THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND- AND IT'S A SIGNIFICANT. SOCIAL ISSUE BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHO'S COMING AND WHO'S GOING WHO REALLY LIVES THERE AND IF YOU'VE GOT A COUPLE THE NEIGHBORS THAT ARE DOING THAT IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD BEFORE YOU KNOW IT THAT. YOU CAN REALLY TELL THEM IT'S INCREDIBLE PRESSURE ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF A COMMUNITY. AND SO THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES DOES IT MAKE SENSE. TO ME BUILDING TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT. FOUR BEDROOM HOUSES OR WHETHER WE SHOULD BE BUILDING A MUCH SMALLER UNITS AND BUILT AND BE BUILDING I'M IN A WAY THAT CREATES OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE TO MOVE INTO SOMETHING THAT SMALL. I BET THEY CAN AFFORD TO BUY AND THEN CAN MOVE UP ECONOMICALLY. BECAUSE. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. THAT THE PRESSURES ON ALMOST THE IN THE ENTIRE PART OF MY DISTRICT IS IT IS REALLY EMBEDDED UP UP AGAINST THE SILICON VALLEY SO UP A LOT OF THEIR COMMUNITIES ARE IMPACTED BY. A COMMUTERS THAT ARE DRIVING AT LEAST TWO HOURS TO GET TO WORK. ON AND- AND IF WE START. IN A SUBJECT FOR ANOTHER HEARING IF WE START ON. PUTTING UP A FEE ON VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE GONNA END UP GETTING HURT OR THAT ARE THE POOREST PEOPLE THAT CAN AFFORD TO WORK. A IN THE WHERE THERE. AND BE IT AND THIS IMPACT BUT LET ME LET ME LET ME LET ME ASK YOU IF THERE'S- IT. I OBVIOUSLY WERE REPRESENT A RURAL- COMMUNITY AND SO SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU SEE IN THE BIG CITIES ARE ARE ARE. REFLECTED A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY IN RURAL CALIFORNIA- IN PARTICULAR IN THE LAST MAN IS IN THE- AND THE PATTERSON AND NEWMAN AREA THAT'S WHERE YOU GET A LOT OF THERE ACTUALLY IS A LOT OF HOMEBUILDING GOING ON. BECAUSE. OF COMMUTERS. PRICING OUT THE LOWER. AND I'M WONDERING IF- IF THE- IF THE PRESSURE FROM. THE THERE'S THIS PRESSURE IN THE REGION FOR GOOD JOBS MY SENSE IS THE PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING IN THOSE JOBS ARE NOT FROM THE REGION- PARTICULARLY GIVEN MY CONVERSATIONS WITH SOME OF THE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND SO ARE PEOPLE COMING IN FROM OUT OF STATE OR THEY COMING FROM THE FROM THE BIGGER CITIES THAT ARE. WHERE THEY'RE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS ARE. YOU HAVE A SENSE OF THAT. AND IT IS IT RESIDENTIAL OR RESIDENTIAL THIS RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL AS WELL BUT IT'S RESIDENTS. IT'S LIKELY THAT THE WORKERS THAT ARE BUILDING THOSE HOMES ARE NOT NECESSARILY PRESIDENTS OF THOSE AREAS IS MOST LIKELY THAT HAPPENS ON WE HAD OF OUR PARTICULAR CASE THAT WE TOOK ALL THE WAY TO THE SUPREME COURT WHERE CHARTER CITIES NOT PAYING THE PREVAILING WAGE OR MUNICIPAL WORK AND WITHIN THAT UP CASE WE PROVIDED INFORMATION TO THE SUPREME COURT WE ENDED UP LOSING THIS CASE BUT- WE PROVIDED INFORMATION THAT TALKED ABOUT WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO PAY. THE PREVAILING WAGE TO THESE WORKERS BECAUSE WORKERS ARE TRANSIT THEIR TEN STORY THEY BELIEVE THEY TRAVEL TO WHERE THE WORK AS AS TO OUR MEMBERS IS NOT- STRANGE THEM ALSO BASICALLY TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO HAVE GET TO THE JOB SITE AND THE TRAVEL OF TWO HUNDRED MILES A DAY. IN A TO GET TO AND FROM THE JOB SITE OF SOME UNFORTUNATELY HAVE TO WORK FARTHER BUT THAT'S JUST IF THE THROUGHTHE WORK IN TERMS OF BUILDING FOR EXAMPLE A WIND FARM OR SOLAR. ENERGY FOR SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT. BUT IT IS INFRASTRUCTURE JACQUE REID AND WHEN IT COMES TO THESE HOMES- Là THESE WORKERS. THE CONTRACTOR WILL PICK UP THE WORK. THE COLIN THEIR WORKERS THEY'LL ALL COMMUTE TOGETHER AND THE ALL. YOU KNOW BASICALLY SPEND THE DAY WORKING. ARM AND THEY WON'T HAVE. THE SORT OF QUALITY OF LIFE NOT ONLY YOU'LL TAKE A THE CYPRESS EITHER THE QUALITY OF THE JOB. BUT THE ACTUAL QUALITY OF LIFE RIGHT THAT THEY HAVE TO TRAVEL TO THE JOB SITE PERHAPS BEEN ALL DAY TRAVELING IN THE NEXT TO HAVE TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN. AND SO IT'S A- IT'S A VERY MENTALLY DANGEROUS INDUSTRY BUT ALSO IT'S A VERY OF PHYSICAL SERVICE STRENUOUS SORT OF A WORK THAT HAPPENS AND- IT TAKES A LOT. OUT OF THE CONSTRUCTION WORKER IN TERMS OF THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR A FOR HIS HER FAMILY TO MATCH WOULD COME HOME AND SPEND QUALITY TIME SO. THE LIKELIHOOD OF A WORKER IN PATTERSON STAYING WITHIN. THE FIFTY MILE RADIUS IS PROBABLY VERY LOW. I WOULD JUST ECHO. AND AN OFFER MAYBE IT ALONE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT- PERSPECTIVE AS WELL. OBVIOUSLY HIGH DENSELY POPULATED AREAS ARE- MAGNETS AND DRAW- INDIVIDUALS WITH YOU NO PROSPECTS OF HIGHER INCOME OPPORTUNITIES- RULE AREAS TEND TO- JUST NOT HAVE THE- THE LABOR POOL. A LOCAL LABOR POOL TO MEET EITHER- THE STATE'S WAS AS SKILLED WORKFORCE- I REQUIREMENTS. AND SO YOU KNOW OTHERS WILL NEED TO COME IN TO HELP. OFFSET THOSE NUMBERS AND IN ORDER FOR THE JOB TO BE- COMPLIANT- AND SO THOSE RULE AREAS STILL HAVE. PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE PUBLIC PROP PROJECTS. WHETHER IT'S THE LOCAL JAIL. OR THE LOCAL SCHOOL SO A LOT OF TIMES THOSE PARENTS HER- OR THE YOU KNOW THE ONES THAT ARE- IN THE CONSTRUCTION AND HAVE THEIR KIDS. TO GO TO SCHOOL. PRESUMABLY AT THAT LOCATION THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO WORK ON THAT BECAUSE- JUST NOT ENOUGH WORKERS IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA TO ME WHATEVER THIS COMPLIANCE IS- AND SO. THOSE FROM HIGHER DENSITY POPULATED AREAS WILL COME IN- METERS COMPLIANCE NUMBERS- AND AS- SAYS EARLY TO YOU KNOW THAT. USUALLY THE HOTELS AND TOURISM- LOOK AT INDUSTRY BUT IT'S FROM THAT- FROM STAYING AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILY BUT IT. IT IS IT'S A TAXING SITUATION ON ALL THOSE AND TOOLS. SO HOW ABOUT THE PRINTER PROGRAMS I GUESS WHAT I'M WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET TO IS. EIGHT THERE'S A REAL NEED FOR GOOD JOBS IN RURAL CALIFORNIA AS WELL. AND IF THE JOBS AREN'T THERE NECESSARILY ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS THEN YOU'RE NOT GONNA SEE THE SAME INTEREST IN IN THE JOB. IN IN GETTING THE TRAINING IF YOU WILL- THAT YOU WOULD IF THERE ARE LOTS OF CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS GOING ON AND RIGHT NOW HIGH SPEED RAIL IS MADE A TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THAT'S BEEN A GREAT. IT REALLY HAS BEEN A- AT. ECONOMIC BOON FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY FOR PEOPLE WHO HAD A HARD TIME FINDING A JOB AND NOW WE'RE GETTING TRAINED. AND ARE DOING. A REALLY GOOD JOB. BUT UNLESS YOU HAVE ENOUGH PROJECTS LIKE THAT THEN YOU DON'T KEEP THE WORK FORCE THERE THEY'LL MOVE SOMEWHERE ELSE THAT'S RIGHT- IT'S AN IMPORTANT. ASPECT OF IN AND THEN RAIN MENTION I THINK- MISTER COCHRAN ALSO OF. COLLUDED TO IT. WHEN YOU HAVE PROJECTS THAT REQUIRE CERTAIN SKILLS THAT OR CONDITION LET'S JUST SAY LOCAL HIRE. A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT- THE HIGH SPEED RAIL OF. PROJECT HOUSING COMMITTEE WORKFORCE SO PEOPLE FROM THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. HAVE TO BASICALLY WORK ON THIS PROJECT. THEY'RE NOT ONLY WORKING ON HIGH SPEED RAIL THE RALLY CHRISTIANS THAT ARE ALSO WORKING ON SOLAR FARMS AND SO IBEW. AND THE AND WORKERS WILL BOTH ARE WORKING ON HIGH RAIL AS WELL. ARE ACTIVELY RECRUITING IN THOSE AREAS. THE TWO PEOPLE TO WORK ON SOLAR FARMS AND THE WORKERS AND TRANSITION FROM THEN THERE ARE THIS IS. THE ONE ACTUALLY. HI SPUR OF SYSTEM. NOW THERE LOCAL WORKERS. THEY'RE GOING TO KEEP THEIR WE JUST WITH THE LOCAL ECONOMY THEY MAY ACTUALLY THEN. PURCHASE A HOME SOME OF THOSE THERE ARE TO BE BUILT AT OUR SENSE OF. HAVING MULTIPLE AGREEMENTS WITH IN AN ERROR BE A PUBLIC AND PRIVATE. HELPS. US BASICALLY BY MORE. ABOUT. AND YOU HAVE MORE RESTAURANTS MORE HOTELS MORE ENTERTAINMENT. YOU KNOW JUST DIFFERENT THINGS ARE ACTUALLY RECYCLE AND THEN YOU HAVE MORE INVESTMENTS FROM ACTUAL OTHER UNION CRAFT THAT WERE LIKE TO PERHAPS BUILD SATELLITE TYPE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS THERE. AND START GROWING THEIR NUMBERS BECAUSE THEY GO TO WHERE THE NEED IS. EXAMPLE IS THE IMPERIAL VALLEY. SO SAN DIEGO IS BASICALLY THE ECONOMIC CENTER AND IN THAT AREA. BUT WHEN THE DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY HAPPENED IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT. THERE'S TWO THINGS ARE HAPPENING THAT HELP OUR MEMBERS OUT AND I WAS WE WERE SEEN 40% 50% UNEMPLOYMENT SOME LOCALS. WELL I B. W. WAS BUILDING A NEW APPRENTICESHIP CENTER IN THE IMPERIAL VALLEY. THEY WERE DOING THAT BECAUSE THE POLICY CREATED BY YOU HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE THAT THERE WAS A RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD THAT WAS HIGHER. WAS CREATING A LOT OF JOB OPPORTUNITIES BASICALLY BUILDING RENEWABLE ENERGY CENTERS RIGHT THERE. AND SO THEY WANTED TO THE ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF HAVING LOCAL WORKERS HAVE ACCESS AND TRAINING SO THEY BILLS SATELLITE OFFICE. LIKEWISE IN THE AGO THE PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT THERE. ENSURE THAT WHILE THERE WAS OTHER LOCALS AND OTHER PLACES IN THE COMMERCIAL RESIDENTIAL WERE DOWN. THE PUBLIC WORKS SECTOR WAS ACTUALLY PICKING UP A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR WORKERS THERE AND THEY WERE ACTUALLY GROWING AND FOR. US AS WELL. SO THAT'S MY THOSE PROJECT. AS A COMMUNITY. IT'S WORK BECAUSE THEY THEY COUNTERACT A LOT OF THOSE ISSUES IMPROVE THE QUALITY NOT JUST IN THE CONSTRUCTION BUT ALSO THE QUALITY OF LIFE WORKERS. I JUST REGISTERED TO THE- ON THAT A LITTLE BIT. ON THE MESSAGE OR SAID THAT HIGH SPEED RAIL IT IS UNDER CAN YOU WORKFORCE AGREEMENT- ONE OF OUR MULTI CRAFT PRECONSTRUCTION TRAINING PROGRAMS- SERVICES CENTRAL VALLEY ITS BASE IN FRESNO- SO IT'S BEEN WORKING WITH COMMITTEE BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND WORK AND THE WORK FORCE BOARDS. INTHE CENTRAL VALLEY TO HELP PEOPLE GET ACCESS TO. JOBS ON HIGH SPEED RAIL- AND JUST RECENTLY THREE WORKERS DURING THE OUT SO THEY ARE STARTED FOR FIVE YEARS AGO- ERR NOW JOURNEY LEVEL WORKERS BECAUSE OF A PRE CONSTRUCTION TRAINING PROGRAM BY TARGETS WOMEN OF PEOPLE OF COLOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. AND THE DIVERSITY IN THESE COHORTS OF TRAINEES ARE WILL TO CRACK UP PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS IS EXACTLY THE WHAT YOU WANT THE TRADES- DEMOGRAPHICS TO LOOK LIKE AND IT'S MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION- VERY DELIBERATELY. THAT'S GREAT WELL I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO. TO DO A TOUR A NUMBER OF TIMES ON THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT AND TO ALSO TALK TO SOME OF THE WORKERS THAT ARE OUT THERE DOING- THE WERE THE ACTUAL WORK AND IT'S BEEN. REALLY IMPRESSIVE AND SO THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE WHAT YOU SEEN TERMS OF THE VARIETY OF. OF OPPORTUNITY SO THESE APPRENTICES COULD MOVE FROM ONE PROJECT TO ANOTHER STAY WITHIN THEIR OWN REGION AND THEN- EVENTUALLY WORK INTO THE JOURNEY. YOUR NAME AND FACE WHICH IS GREAT. WHILE THE ON. ON ONE LAST FIGHT IS I SAW IT A COMMUNITY THAT STARTED TO TRYING TO CHANGE THE NARRATIVE ABOUT- WORKING- AT THE INCOME IN THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES AND THEY HAD A SIGNING CEREMONY. FOR THAT THE DAY THAT THEY WERE SIGNING UP WITH THE TRADES VERY MUCH LIKE THE SIGNING CEREMONIES IT THEY DO FOR SPORTS AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS REALLY A UNIQUE- OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY GET YOUNG PEOPLE EXCITED ABOUT A NEW A NEW START. A NEW CAREER- AND WE MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT DOING SOMETHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE GET THE WORD OUT ENOUGH ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES AND- AND- THIS IS THAT. THIS IS A GUARDIAN NOT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE THE PIECES WE NEED TO PUT TOGETHER TO GET OUT THERE BECAUSE- THAT THE PUBLIC MONEY INVOLVED IT WILL IS MENU IS COMPARED TO OUR RDA- WHAT ARE USED TO PRODUCE AND- AND IF THAT'S ONE OF THE- ONE OF THE. FUEL FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES IT'S WAY TOO SMALL- MAKE THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO THINK BIGGER WOULD HAVE TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE CREATIVE ABOUT HOW AND- IF YOU HAVE SUGGESTIONS I THINK WE'RE OPEN TO LOOKING AT ANYTHING THAT GETS US. GETS IS TO START REALLY MOVING ON THE NUMBER OF UNITS SECOND BUILT EVERY YEAR AT THAT THAT I'VE SEEN A HALF A MILLION UNITS UNITS ARE READY TO GO IN YET WHEN I TALK TO THE CITY SAY SAY WE'VE GOT TO WE'VE GOT PROPERTY. IT'S ALREADY- PERMITTED AND WE CAN'T FIND ANYBODY TO BUILD. AND THAT IS A CONCERN OF MINE. WE'VE BEEN A AT LEAST THE S. R. B. X. WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH A LOT OF OUR INDUSTRY PARTNERS TO AGAIN LOOK UPSTREAM AND TRADED MAKE- OR AT LEAST CHANGE THAT NARRATIVE OF. CONSTRUCTION BEING- AN EXCITING- CAREER OPPORTUNITY- IN ADDITION TO OUR TRADE STAY THAT I ALLUDED TO EARLIER AT CAL EXPO IN TWO THOUSAND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND WAVES OF THREE HUNDRED- COMING IN AND LEARNING- DIFFERENT TRADES WE ALSO HAVE A DESIGN BUILD COMPETITION- WHERE WE- FOR THREE DAYS WORK WITH STUDENTS- WE HAVE MEMBER COMPANIES THAT. DONATE THE REPLIES IN THEIR TIME OF FOR WEEKS LEADING UP TO- THE PROJECT AND THEN- WE USED TO HAVE ACTUALLY ON THE SOUTH STEPS OF THE CAPITOL. WITH THE STATEWIDE COMPETITION. ALL THE LOCAL JUNIOR COLLEGE IN THE PARKING LOT AND THREE DAYS THEY- CONSTRUCT TINY HOMES- AND THEN- OR GO THROUGH DESIGN REVIEW PROCESS. AND THEN ULTIMATELY OR THOSE HOMES ARE DONATED TO LOCAL CHURCHES FOR- TEMPORARY STRUCTURES FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE IN BETWEEN. HOUSING SITUATIONS- THESE ARE ALL YOU KNOW DIFFERENT ERAS IN THE QUIVER IF YOU WILL- THAT WE COULD. BRING OUT TO SCALE IN EVERY COMMUNITY IS DIFFERENT EVERY COMMUNITIES GOING TO RESPOND DIFFERENTLY- BUT AGAIN CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION- HAS- IT HAS A HAS A- A COMMITMENT FROM THE STATE BUT- IN LESS WE INVEST MORE IT JUST WON'T. HANDLE. THE OR AT LEAST TO MEET THE DEMANDED THAT WE HAVE PLACED ON IT WITH OUR OUR POLICIES- UNFORTUNATELY WE JUST HAVE- TOO MANY. OTHER CAREER OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE LIEU PULLING IN LOWERING THESE THESE STUDENTS AWAY I WITH FIFTY THREES- OF VARIOUS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. THE CONSTRUCTIONS REFERENCE 7% AND SO WE JUST NEED TO ENCOURAGE AND EDUCATE- PARENTS TEACHERS GUIDANCE COUNSELORS ACROSS ALL SPECTRUMS TO MAKE THEM AWARE OF WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITIES THAT EXIST IN CONSTRUCTION. RATING THAT'S PROBABLY A GOOD INTRODUCTION TO THE NEXT. PERFECT TRANSITION I WANT WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HRE TODAY REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WORKING WITH YOU. WE'RE GONNA INVITE THE SECOND PANEL TO PLEASE COME FORWARD JILL HERMAN WHO MANAGES AN OVERSEAS THE CALIFORNIA HOMEBUILDING FOUNDATION BUILDING INDUSTRY TECHNOLOGY ACADEMY. PROGRAM WHICH INCLUDES EXPANDING THE CURRICULUM TO CAMPUSES STATEWIDE. RECRUITING IN THIS INDUSTRY SUPPORT AND COORDINATING EVENTS RAISE AWARENESS FOR THE FOR THE PROGRAM. ALSO WON A- OUT WELCOME AT PER DEEP. CORD CODE CAM RIDE YOU THEY SAY THAT RIGHT OKAY WHO RECENTLY JOINED THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAVING PREVIOUSLY SERVED AS THE CHIEF OF THE BUREAU OF CAREER AND TECHNICAL TECHNICAL EDUCATION DIVISION OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES I AWAY DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AS A DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL RESEARCH CENTER FOR CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION AT THE UNIVERSITY. OF LOUISVILLE. PROFESSOR MACABRE L. ANDERSON. WHO IS THE CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SACRAMENTO. AND SIMEON GET WHO IS A GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AND PUBLIC AFFAIRS CONSULTANT AND THE FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE BOARD MEMBER OF GREEN TECHNICAL TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT. A COMMUNITY BASED NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION TEACHING YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS TWELVE TO TWENTY ONE ABOUT CAREER OPPORTUNITIES AND CLEANENERGY. ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND SUSTAINABLE LIVING STRATEGIES WELCOME. VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. WE'LL START OFF WITH MISS HERMAN. SO NOW THAT WE'VE HEARD WITH THE PROBLEM IS I'M I'M ASSUMING YOU GUYS HAVE ALL THE SOLUTIONS RIGHT. OKAY. GOOD GOOD WE'RE LOOKING FOR. OKAY I THINK THIS IS ON AND HELLO MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT THE BUILDING INDUSTRY TECHNOLOGY ACADEMY OR AS WE LIKE TO CALL IT DATA. MY NAME IS JILL HERMAN I WORK FOR THE CALIFORNIA HOMEBUILDING FOUNDATION AND I AM IN THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR FOR BED AT THE PREVIOUS PANEL REALLY TOUCHED ON- THE LABOR SHORTAGE AND- YOU KNOW THE FIVE AND ONE RATIO AND- YOU KNOW. HAVE CONTRACTORS ARE EXPECTING THIS LABOR SHORTAGE TO CONTINUE SO HE BASICALLY TOOK MY WHOLE INTRO. BUT THAT'S OKAY. AND SO WE KNOW THAT THERE'S ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED SKILLED TRADES THAT TAKE IT TAKES TO. BUILD AND SELL ONE HOME YOU KNOW FROM THE SURVEYORS TO THE FRAMERS TO THE PLUMBERS. AND THAT INCREASES AS WE BUILD OUR SCHOOLS ROADS- AND ONLY 20% OF THOSE REALLY I REQUIRE A COLLEGE DEGREE. M. THIRTY THIRTY MILLION JOBS IN THE US THAT PAN AVERAGE OF FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR THAT DO NOT REQUIRE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE. AND A CALIFORNIA CONSTRUCTION WORKERS ANNUAL WAGES AVERAGES ABOUT SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND THAT INCREASES WITH EXPERIENCE CONSTRUCTIONS ONE OF THE FEW INDUSTRIES WHERE YOU CAN WORK YOUR WAY FROM THE BOTTOM TO THE TOP. AND WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN OUR INDUSTRY THAT STARTED- YOU KNOW AS A FRAMER ARE OF SOMEONE THAT WAS DIGGING HOLES AND THEN. ALL THE SUDDEN THERE THE OWNER OF THEIR OWN COMPANY AND THEY WOULDN'T HAVE IT ANY OTHER WAY BECAUSE- THEY CAN REALLY RELATE TO EVERY ASPECT OF THEIR BUSINESS. AND THAT MAKES ME A BETTER BUSINESSMEN IT MAKES THEM A BETTER MANAGER AT AT A REALLY GOOD JUST A REALLY GOOD INDUSTRY. I'M SO ADDRESS LABOR CHARGE. TOUCHED ON THIS IN THE LAST PANEL BUT WE REALLY NEED TO ADDRESS THE MISPERCEPTION ABOUT THIS INDUSTRY. AND WE NEED TO START WORKING WITH INDUSTRY TO PROVIDE CURRICULUM TRAINING EDUCATION. FOR THE NEXT GENERATION AND THAT'S REALLY WHERE MY PASSION EXISTS AND WHY I DO WHAT I DO. SO MUCH TALKED ABOUT THAT AT. A WIDE SUCCESS WIDE SIX AND A GOOD EDUCATION MODEL FOR BRIDGING THE SKILLS GAP- WHY THE INDUSTRY SHOULD BE ENGAGED WITH THIS MODEL- AND FINALLY I'LL LEAVE YOU WITH A FEW ACTION ITEMS. AND SO BET AS A FOUR YEAR CONSTRUCTION TRAINING CURRICULUM THAT. AND IS PROVIDED AT NO COST TO CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOLS ON BY THE CALIFORNIA HOMEBUILDING FOUNDATION THIS CURRICULUM SERVES AS A CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PATHWAYS PROGRAM OF. C. T. E. WHICH WE'VE TALKED ABOUT- AND IT'S- APPROVED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA UNDER THE G. ELECTIVE REQUIREMENT WHICH MEANS THAT SINCE THAT TAKE THIS CLASS. GET THEIR ELECTIVE REQUIREMENTS NOT ONLY TO GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL BUT USUALLY THAT TRANSLATES INTO- GETTING IN THEIR REQUIREMENTS INTO UC OR CSU SYSTEMS- SO THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. AND THE PROGRAM FOR BETTER GREW OUT OF A UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCE. OUR INDUSTRY WAS INVITED TO A CAREER DAY AT A HIGH SCHOOL. AND THEY WERE GONNA GET SOME TALKS ABOUT THE INDUSTRY INSTANCE COULD PICK WHAT INDUSTRIES THEY WANTED TO GO LISTEN TO. AT LOAN BEHOLD THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY WAS VERY SPARSELY ATTENDED. AND THOUGH HE ASKED THE STUDENTS YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AND- THE PERCEPTION IS YAK INSTRUCTIONS OF THE JOB. IT'S AN IT'S RELIABLE IT'S MANUAL BURKE AND IT'S NOT CAREER BASED AND SO HE SAID YES WE REALLY NEED TO CHANGE THE NARRATIVE SO HE DEVELOPED THE CURRICULUM IN TWO THOUSAND TWO WITH NORTH ORANGE COUNTY ROP REGIONAL OCCUPATIONAL PROGRAMS- AND THAT. I A WHICH IS THE INDUSTRY SAYS GEN. I'M THE EVEN SPONSORED A NEW CONSTRUCTION AB THEY PAY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT THE CREEK LAMB SO THAT THAT SPREAD VERY QUICKLY IN ANAHEIM TO EIGHT SCHOOLS. AND THEN- BUT IT WAS ADOPTED BY MY FOUNDATION IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE TO MAKE IT A STATEWIDE. INITIATIVE AND WERE NOW THIRTY TWO HIGH SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. FORCED BY EDUCATING AND INSPIRING THESE STUDENTS TO JOIN OUR INDUSTRY. SO HOW ARE WE DOING THIS AND WHY HAS IT BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL- I THINK THE PROGRAM IS WIDELY POPULAR AMONG OUR EDUCATIONAL PARTNERS BECAUSE THE CURRICULUM MEETS THE NEEDS OF OUR COLLEGE AND CAREER BOUND STUDENTS. ANSWER MEMBER I KIND OF TALKED ABOUT THAT G. ELECTIVE AND WHEN YOU HAVE A COLLEGE BOUND STUDENT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE AN ELECTIVE COURSEUNLESS IT'S GOING TO BENEFIT THEIR ABILITY TO GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL ORGAN TO COLLEGE SO THAT G. REQUIREMENT OR ANY REQUIREMENT YOU YOU KNOW YOU CAN BE YOU CAN BE CONSTRUCTION MATH AND THAT WOULD BE. AT FOR SOMETHING LIKE AND LOOKING TO YOU. YEAH YEAH OKAY. SO YOU CAN AT. FOR CURRICULA FOR INDUSTRY AB CURRICULUMS I'M AND WE'RE CAREER BASE BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU THINK ABOUT THOSE KIDS YOU THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL AND YOU KNOW THOSE KIDS THAT DON'T PERFORM WELL IN TRADITIONAL CLASSES THEY DON'T THINK COLLEGES THE RIGHT PATH FOR THEM THEY DON'T HAVE SUPPORT AT HOME TO OBTAIN A COLLEGE DEGREE THEY NEED PROGRAMS LIKE THAT. AGAIN AGAINST THE CLASS I'M HAVE HANDS ON APPLICATION THEY'RE GONNA BY THE MASS THAT THEY'RE LEARNING IN GEOMETRY AND APPLY IT THE PRICE TAG. AND FRAMING AND SLOPE OF A ROOF SO THEY REALLY NEED. ARMS TO KIND OF GET THEM ENGAGED WITH THEIR LEARNING PROCESS. SO I THINK IT'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE WE'RE TAKING INTERESTING KIDS AND WE'RE TELLING ABOUT OBTAINABLE CAREERS IN CONSTRUCTION AND WE'RE TEACHING THEM THE SKILLS AND WERE ALSO TELLING THEM. YOU KNOW THESE EMPLOYABILITY SKILLS OR SOFT SKILLS. SO YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT ONLY SAYING HEY. ADD THIS IS HOW YOU FRAME THIS I USE HAMMERS HOW YOU MET MEASURE BUT WE'RE ALSO SAYING LOOK SOMEBODY IN THE EYE WHEN YOU'RE SHAKING THEIR HANDS OR SHOW UP TO WORK ON TIME. AND THIS IS HOW YOU WRITE A RESUME SO THESE ARE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULUMS AS WE TALK ABOUT CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND HIGH SCHOOLS. AND AT THE PRACTICAL TRAINING AT DOES LEAD TO EMPLOYMENT AND IT DOES LEAD TO IMPLEMENT AT ABOUT MINIMUM WAGE LEVELS- AND THE ABILITY TO ESTABLISH AN EMPLOYMENT RECORD- PROVIDES THE ABILITY TO SUPPORT A FAMILY AND HAVE SECURITY IN LIFE. ULTIMATELY AB I'M GLAD ADDING BROUGHT UP THAT DESIGN BILL COMPETITION BECAUSE WE DO PARTNER ALL OF OUR BETTER PROGRAMS FOR HER AND PRINT. AND SHE'S. GET INVOLVED WITH THE DESIGN BILL COMPETITION- THERE'S ONE UP IN SACRAMENTO ADD HOSTED BY THE SRB XCF AND THEN ONE DOWN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO THE DESIGN BILL COMPETITION IS REALLY IS SPECIAL BECAUSE IT'S FREE TO STUDENTS AND SCHOOLS TO PARTICIPATE. THE INDUSTRY IS FULLY ENGAGED THEY HAVE A TOTAL CONTROL OVER THEIR PROJECT THEY DESIGN AT THEY BUILD IT OVER TWO DAYS INDUSTRIES WALKING AROUND SAYING HEY YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB DOING THIS OR DON'T DO THAT THAT'S NOT SAFE. THOSE KIND OF PROVIDING A REAL WORLD EXPERIENCE FOR THEM AND ALSO A LOT OF THESE KIDS THEY DON'T. THEY ARE ATHLETES SO THEY DON'T GET THAT TEAM- EXPERIENCED A LOT OF ATHLETES STILL SO THE DECEMBER COMPETITION PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY THAT FOR THEM TO WORKING GROUP'S THEY CAN TAKE ON LEADERSHIP. ROLES A LEARN HOW TO COMPLETE A PROJECT ON TIME THAT'S A REALLY GREAT COMPETITION- AND OUR PROGRAM IS AGNOSTIC SO I AM SAYING WE'RE NOT REALLY TELLING THE FOURTEEN YEAR OLD FRESHMAN YOU HAVE TO BE AN ELECTRICIAN ARE YOU HAVE TO BE A FRAMER. YOU HAVE TO GO INTO RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION YOU HAVE TO GO IN A COMMERCIAL WE'RE KIND OF PROVIDING A BROAD. OVERVIEW OF THE INDUSTRY AND GIVING THEM THE SKILLS THEY NEED TO GET INTO THE INDUSTRY. I'M AND THEN WE TELL THEM THE OPTIONS ABOUT- WHERE THEY CAN GO AFTER GRADUATION SO THEY CAN DO COMMUNITY COLLEGE THEY CAN GO ON A CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AT STATE COLLEGE THEY CAN- AND ROLAND APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM OR THEY CAN GO. RIGHT ON TO THE JOB SITE AND HOMEBUILDING. AND WE JUST KIND OF LEAVE IT OPEN BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE FOURTEEN FIFTEEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO GO. YOU KNOW AB BUT IT. THE REASON WHY IT HAS. SO AT SUCCESSFUL IS THAT WE'RE GETTING OUR INDUSTRY. ENGAGED AND PARTICIPATING. WITH THESE PROGRAMS. SO IN SHE CAN GET ENGAGE WITH THE PROGRAMS BY BASICALLY GETTING INTO THE CLASSROOM GUEST SPEAKER PARENTS SAYS INTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITIES. INVITING THEM OUT TO THE CONSTRUCTION WORK SITE PROVIDING A PROJECT A MENTOR GUIDED PROJECT- WHEN WE SHOW INVESTMENT AND THE KIDS. IT REALLY RESONATES WITH THEM AND THEY'RE GONNA MEET. FOLKS THAT THEY MIGHT NOT NORMALLY HAVE ACCESS TO. SO YOU KNOW THE- THE OWNER OF TRY POINT HOMES COULD COME IN AND TALK ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCE IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY THE NEXT DAY. YOU KNOW ALLEN S. FRAMING COMES BY AND THEY DO AN AFTER SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION BOOT. CAMP AND- SHOW THEM HOW TO FRAME UP BY TEN BY TEN. YOU KNOW MONTEL JUST REAL QUICK AND- THEY'RE MAKING THOSE CONNECTIONS AND SHARING BUSINESS CARDS. SO THAT'S HOW THIS INDUSTRY IS GOING TO CHANGE THE PERCEPTION. OF ODD THE CAREERS THAT ARE AVAILABLE. AND GET KIDS EXCITED. ABOUT THIS INDUSTRY WE HAVE TO BE ENGAGED. AND SO I'M TRYING TO FOLLOW MY TALKING POINTS HERE AND I GET SO EXCITED AND SO L. M. NGUYEN INDUSTRY GETS ENGAGED IT REALLY CHANGES THEIR PERCEPTION TOO BECAUSE I MEAN HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU HEARD AND AS YOU SAY- KIDS DON'T WANT TO WORK THERE ON THEIR CELL PHONE THEY JUST SHOW UP LATE. YEAH THEY JUST WANNA GO HOME AND PLAY VIDEO GAMES WILL THAT IS NOT TRUE IS REALLY ISN'T AN INDUSTRY GETS INTO THESE CLASSROOMS AND THEY MEET THE KIDS AND THEY GET TO TRAIN THEM THEIR WAY THAT'S ANOTHER THING I HEAR A LOT I JUST WANT TO TRAIN KIDS MY WAY- SO THEY GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT AND BASICALLY OUR HANSEL. TING THERE'S THEIR EMPLOYEES ARE FUTURE EMPLOYEES IF THEY IF THEY GET ENGAGED. SO PROGRAMS LIKE BETTER IN OTHER HELPING KIDS UNDERSTAND THE OPPORTUNITIES AND CONSTRUCTION THAT THEY MAY HAVE NOT KNOWN BEFORE BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING IN THE CLASSROOM OR TELLING HIM ABOUT IT WE HAVE THIS CURRICULUM THAT KIND OF GIVES A BROAD OVERVIEW AND SKILLS THEY NEED- AND SO THAT IS. NOT A TO ADDRESS THIS LACK OF A SKILLED WORKFORCE SO THE MODEL OF. YOUR SANCTIONED CURRICULUM. THAT. ENCOURAGES LEARNING THEIR PRACTICAL APPLICATION ALONGSIDE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN EDUCATORS AND INDUSTRY. IS THE WAY WE'RE GOING TO RECRUIT. AND RETAIN. ALLION PLACE IN THIS WORK FORCE. AND HAVE TO END WITH NOT ONLY ARE WE BUILDING COMMUNITIES THAT WE ARE BUILDING CAREERS. WE ARE CELEBRATING THE SORRY ONE LEVY WITH. AND IT'S BEEN SAID BEFORE WE NEED TO PROVIDE MORE FUNDING TO BUILD CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS IN HIGH SCHOOLS THAT'S ABSOLUTELY NUMBER ONE BUT THOSE CITY PROGRAM'S REALLY NEED TO MEET THE DEMAND FOR LABOR. ARE WITHIN THE REGION AND THEY HAVE TO UPHOLD THE REQUIREMENT THAT INDUSTRY IS ENGAGED IN PROVIDING THOSE OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE AGAIN YOU HAVE TO KIND OF DO THE HAND HOLDING THESE ARE JUST KIDS. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON I MEAN WHEN I GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL HE DIDN'T KNOW WHO IS HIRING WHAT YOU NEEDED TO GET BE HIRED OR WHO TO CONTACT. AND SO THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. WE COULD ALSO USE FUNDING FOR THE FIVE OH ONE C. THREE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE PROVIDING THESE CURRICULUMS AND BECAUSE WE ARE PROVIDING THE CURRICULUM ARE WORKING TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN EDUCATION AND INDUSTRY. AND PROGRAMS LIKE BED AT NIGHT OF GREEN TECH WITH HIM YOU'LL HEAR FROM LATER- WE COULD REALLY USE SOME GRANT FUNDING TO HELP MAKE. THAT HAPPEN AND FINALLY AS WE COME TO THE TABLE YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB HERE TODAY WITH THIS HEARING AND I APPRECIATE BEING HERE- BUT WE NEED EVERYONE AT THE TABLE. AT INDUSTRY COMMUNITY EDUCATIONAL PARTNERS BECAUSE INDUSTRY CAN COME INTO THE CREDIT AL YEAH HIGHER FIVE OF YOUR SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD STUDENTS AND EDUCATION AS THEY WILL KNOW YOU CAN'T HIRE SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD SOON YOU HAVE TO WALK THROUGH ALL THESE. BARRIERS IN THESE HOOPS TO GET THERE SO EVERYONE IS BE AT THE TABLE SO KIND OF BREAK DOWN SOME OF THESE BARRIERS UNDERSTAND WITH THE GOAL OF OUR OF OUR PROGRAMS AND OUR ORGANIZATIONS. TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THESE OPPORTUNITIES FOR KIDS. SO THAT IS MY SPIEL. ABOUT THAT. AT AND- THANK YOU AGAIN **** YOUR INPUT. MADAM CHAIR SINCE THE GLAZER THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FOR BEING HERE I BRING GREETINGS FROM- A SUPERINTENDENT THURMOND. CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION OUR IS OFTEN AND I'M TO USE STRATEGY IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOR CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. GETTING ALL HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS COLLEGE AND CAREER READY REGARDLESS OF PERSON PLACE OR POSITION. AND IT ALSO DOES UP SKILLING AND RE SKILLING OF ADULTS OF ALL AGES THE CITY SPECIFICALLY THOSE FROM TRADITIONALLY UNDER REPRESENTED GROUPS TO AND TO THE CURRENT AND FUTURE WORK FORCE. C. T. INTEGRATES CORE ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE WITH THE TECHNICAL IN OCCUPATIONAL KNOWLEDGE OF PROVIDE. STUDENTS WITH THE PARKWAY TO POST SICKENING EDUCATION CAREERS. CITY PROGRAMS THAT DRIVEN BY STUDENT INTEREST AND I THINK IN AND AS AS THE PREVIOUS BALANCE OF SPOKEN- STUDENT INTEREST IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE ENGENDERED AT A VERY EARLY AGE FOR THESE TWO THIS PARTICULARLY IN THE IT WHAT I WILL CALL AND GENERALLY THE TRADES AREA AND I'LL TALK A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THAT. LATER IT ALSO TALKS ABOUT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT CURRENT IN REGIONAL STATEWIDE LABOR MARKET DATA INDUSTRY ADVOCACY AND INVOLVEMENT AND ADELINE WINDED PROGRAMS OFFERED IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS. K. TWELVE CITY PROGRAMS ARE FOR OFFERED A UNIQUE IN THAT THEY EMPHASIZEDTHE INTEGRATION OF CATHOLIC EDUCATION ACADEMICS WITH CITY COURSES AND THE COURSE IS A BASED ON SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED WITHIN THE DA IN DEPARTMENT CALL THE CT MODEL CURRICULUM STANDARDS. FOR ALL FOR OUR FIFTEEN INDUSTRY PATHWAYS. WE HAVE CAREER AND TECHNICAL STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS SKILLS USA IS A IS AN EXAMPLE WHERE THE BUILDING TRADES. GET STUDENTS GET EXPERIENCE FOR I LIVE AS A LEADERSHIP AND STUDENTS ARE PROVIDED THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE IN A CONTINUUM OF WORK BASED LEARNING EXPERIENCES THROUGHOUT THEIR CITY COURSE SEQUENCE. AND THIS IS SOMETHING I THINK I KNOW WHAT WE'RE WE WILL BE DISCUSSING TO IS THE POSSIBILITY OF ENROLLING IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE C. D. COURSES AS WELL AS IT I HAD A STATE UNIVERSITIES AND AT THAT AND EVEN POTENTIALLY ATTAINING POST SECONDARY CREDENTIALS WHILE THE STUDENT IS STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL. JUST TO GIVE YOU SOME NUMBERS FIFTY CD'S SO SIX POINT THREE MILLION STUDENTS AND EIGHT EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. OFF THE STAGE NEARLY TWO MILLION ENROLLMENTS IN GRADES NINE TO TWELVE JUST OVER HOFFA AND ROLLED IN CT. MORE IMPORTANTLY THIS PERCENTAGES INCREASED FROM ABOUT 40% AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS DECADE 250% TODAY. SO THERE IS TO HEIGHTEN INTEREST IN C. T. ACROSS THE BOARD WITHIN TO HIGH SCHOOL. WITH THE HIGH SCHOOLS AND THE CAGE WITH TWELVE SYSTEM. OVER THIS TIME PERIOD C. D. IS INCREASINGLY COME TO BE SEEN AS A STRATEGY TO IMPROVE EQUITY IN ACCESS. WE DO THAT THROUGH US TO OF THAT TO A VARIETY OF STATE AND FEDERAL PROGRAMS. IT MEANS THE NEEDS OF BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY AND PROVIDE STUDENTS THE RIGHT EXPERIENCE FOR LEARNING. IN ORDER TO PREPARE THEM FOR THE CURRENT AND FUTURE WORTHLESS. THE OVER ARCHING GOAL. IS TO SHOW THAT C. D. IS CENTRAL TO STUDENT LEARNING AND SUCCESS IS MEASURED BY COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS. OFF THE FIFTEEN INDUSTRY PATHWAYS THAT WE HAVE IT WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. ONE OF THEM IS THE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES. STATE WIDE THEIR FIVE HUNDRED FOR SIXTY FIVE HIGH SCHOOLS THAT OFFER AT LEAST ONE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TRADES COURSE WITH OVER TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED OF COURSE IS BEING TAUGHT IN THEIR FORTY THOUSAND. OVER. FOR FORTY THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED STUDENTS ENROLLED A IN BUILDING CONSTRUCTION STATE DISTRICT THE STATE IS SEEING A SHIFT FROM THE TRADITIONAL WOOD SHOP. TO MORE SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS LIKE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TRADES CABINET MAKING MATT MASONRY H. BACK USING CURRENT INDUSTRY TECHNOLOGIES. WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT DIVERSE WORKFORCE A IT SHORTAGES BUT WE ALSO HAVE WE HAVE A THREE HUNDRED CREDENTIAL FOUR TIMES A DAY FOR LET'S SEE INSTRUCTORS IN K. TWELVE IN THIS AREA AND THAT'S DODD NOT ENOUGH TO MEET THE MEET THE DEADLINE SO. AS MORE EXPERIENCED TEACHERS ARE RETIRING THIS STATE IS SEEING A CHEF FROM TEACHERS WITH THE WITH AN INDUSTRIAL ARTS SINGLE SUBJECT CREDENTIAL TO TEACHERS WITH A DESIGNATED SUBJECT. CREDENTIAL WHICH REQUIRES INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE BUT THEY. ALSO NEED HELP FOR THE PEDAGOGY IN THE CLASSROOM. THE TYPE OF CERTIFICATES- CREDENTIALS STUDENTS CAN EARN ARE QUALIFIED TO OUR AND TO INCLUDE. THINGS LIKE SHOULD TEN WOULD BE BETTER I HAD TO RAINY WAS TALKING ABOUT SAFETY THAT I THINK SHOULD START EARLY AND OFTEN HIGH SCHOOL FOR THEM TO GET THIS AND THEY SHOULD BE AWARDED THAT THAT THE CREDENTIALS WE HAVE ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR CONSTRUCTION IT EDUCATION RESEARCH. THAT HAVE CORRECT LEVEL WHO ALSO HAVE THE IS THAT THE CURRICULUM THAT YOU DIDN'T LIKE YOURS IN MANY OTHER CONSTRUCTION. CURRICULUM OUT THERE. COLLEGE GOING OPPORTUNITIES INCREASE FOR STUDENTS WHEN SECONDARY AND POST SECONDARY INSTRUCTORS WORKING A WORK TOGETHER TO ALIGN CURRICULUM AND INSTRUCTION. BUILDERS ARE OFFERING A SIR AT BUILDERS ARE OFFERING INTERNSHIP TO STUDENTS DURING THE SUMMER AND SOME DURING SCHOOL ARE OFF TO SCHOOL US TWO EXAMPLES THE HABITAT FOR HUMANITY AND IN OUR HOME. EXEMPLARS OF HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY OF BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TRADE PROGRAMS ARE AT THE SILLINESS HIGH SCHOOL. SUSTAINABLE DESIGN AND GREEN CONSTRUCTION. LUTHER BUT OF BURBANK HIGH SCHOOL HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND A CONSTRUCTION DAYS ON AYE AYE AYE WHICH IS THE CONSTRUCTION DESIGN I CAN ACT ACADEMY AND THE NORTH HOLLYWOOD HIGH SCHOOL A LOT IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA WHICH THEY CALL HOME ENGINEERING HAD IT. SO GENERALLY SPEAKING ALL THE STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING FOR C. T. PROGRAMS INCLUDE THOSE IN THE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TRADES FOCUS AND IMPROVEMENTS IN MODIFICATION IN THREE AREAS. MAKING ALL SCHOOL DISTRICT CITY PROGRAM'S HIGH QUALITY BY CONTINUOUSLY REVISITING LAP DATING C. T. PROGRAM CURRICULUM AND DELIVERY METHODS. CONSULAR TRAINING SPECIFIC TO SEE T. AN EXPANDING AND REFINING CD CREDENTIALS TO BUILD OUT THE TEACHER PIPELINE. IT IS THE SECOND AREA WE NEED TO INCREASE IN HEIGHT AND THE CONNECTION TO BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY TO WORK BASED LEARNING. NOT INTERNSHIPS APPRENTICESHIPS AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT TEACHER APRENDER EXTENSION BUT I WOULD INCLUDE IN THIS PARTICULAR THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL FREE APPRENTICESHIPS THAT IS SOMETHING THAT DO WE HIT WE HAVE THAT IN OUR AND NOT CALIFORNIA POTS WAS ACADEMY PROGRAM BUT WE NEED TO HAVE MORE OF THAT. AS WE MOVE FORWARD. AND THE THIRD AREA IS TO EXPAND THAT AT THE SECOND THE POST SECONDARY. IN ADDITION THROUGH DUAL ENROLLMENT SYSTEMATIC IN UNIFORM ARTICULATION PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES INCLUDING C. D. WITH WITHIN THE A TO G. FRAMEWORK AND COMPLETING POST SECOND CREDENTIALS AS HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. SO ARE MORE BROADLY IF IMPLEMENTED THE PREPONDERANCE OF HIGH QUALITY C. T. WITHIN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT SHOULD SO GREATER ALIGNMENT OF BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY NEEDS AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS TO WOODS ACCESS AND EQUITY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT WAS VERY WELL DONE SHE TO. I HAVE MY LIST OF THINGS WE NEED NOW. RESERVE HI. OKAY SORRY ABOUT THAT. SO MINUTE SHIFT GEARS A LITTLE BIT KIND OF TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING. OF YAK OUT THE HAND OUT HERE IS SO SHOULD YEARS OLDER TART TALK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING EXACTLY THE STATE I STARTED THEIR TEACHER LEFT THE INDUSTRY I'M I'M A STRUCTURAL ENGINEER AND ALSO CONTRACTOR AND- BUT THE INDUSTRY TWO THOUSAND RATED TO GIVE BACKING AND GIVE ALL THE UNIVERSITY AND- AT THE TIME WE HAD. VERY LOW ENROLLMENT- IN THE CONSTRUCTION MANAGER PROGRAM- LESS THAN A HUNDRED FIFTY STUDENTS IN ABOUT NINE GRADUATES YEAR. AND IT WAS AT THAT TIME THAT THE INDUSTRY SAID YOU KNOW WE ARE GOING TO DECIDE TO SUPPORT. THIS PROGRAM OR WE'RE GOING TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE AND RON BROWN. I'M STILL HERE HE'S ONE OF TEN FOUNDER SUBSIDED. NOW WE'RE GOING TO SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM. AT MOVIE FOUR TO TODAY WE HAVE OVER FORMER STUDENTS IN THE PROGRAM FOR GRADUATING ABOUT SEVENTY STUDENTS THIS NEXT YEAR- WE MAINTAIN ONE HUNDRED AND JOB PLACEMENT- AND- AS I LOOK BACK TO PREPARE FOR TODAY- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE HELPED US GET THEIR TERMS FOR SUCCESSES SO IT'S FINE. SHARES OF THOSE THINGS THIS YEAR. SO IF THIS THING. DOES WORK. SO IN TERMS OF BUILDING TRADE PARTNERSHIPS- YOU KNOW WE- SAW OUR STUDENTS WHEN THEY GRADUATE THEY'RE GONNA BE THE ONES THAT ARE A GUY CAN BE ON THE MANAGEMENT TEAM FOR THE PROJECTS ARE NOT TO BE IN THE TRAITS. OF THEIR EARLY MANAGING THE TRADES- SCHEDULES ESTIMATES- YOUR WORK WITH THE OWNERS AND SO FORTH. AND MANAGING THE QUALITY THE CONSTRUCTION THAT'S WHAT WE TRAIN THEM TO DO. PROVIDE THAT- ALL OF OUR FACULTY COME FROM THE INDUSTRY- WE ALL HAD WORKED IN THE INDUSTRY EITHER AS- ARCHITECTS ENGINEERS CONTRACTORS- BUSINESS- ADMINISTRATION SO FORTH- BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO STAY INVOLVED AND I'D LISTED SOME OF THE ORGANIZATIONS UP HERE THAT. THAT WE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH THE SOME OF THINGS WE DO. I'LL TAKE STUDENTS TO THEIR TRAINING CENTERS THE UNION TRADING CENTERS A WALK THROUGH WHAT THEY DO- WE HAVE ALL THE CARPENTERS UNION- COUPLE YEARS AGO WHERE THEY HAVE A PRETTY SURE PROGRAM OR-STUDENTS WILL GO IN AND BE AN APPRENTICE IN THE FIELD FOR A SUMMER. AND COME BACK TO THE YOU TO SEPARATE STATE AND CONTINUE WITH THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT SIDE. WE HAVE A LOT OF CLUBS ON CAMPUS THAT INVOLVE THESE ORGANIZATIONS I JUST GOT BACK FROM DC A FEW WEEKS AGO WITH ONE OF THESE CLUBS- WE HAD A FORM WITH OVER TO OUR STUDENTS AROUND THE COUNTRY- GREAT FUTURES- YOU CONNECTING THEM ABOUT WORKING. AND EXPOSED. TO THAT PART OF THE INDUSTRY. WE HAVE HAD SOME REALLY GREAT SUCCESSES SUMMARY PRODUCT HERE PRACTICE PICTURES JUST TAKEN LAST WEEKEND- AND WE'RE IN CHICAGO WE- TOOK A GROUP SINCE OUT CHICAGO COMPETE IN ACADEMIC COMPETITION. AGAINST SCHOOLS FROM THE MIDWEST EAST COAST. AND HAPPY TO THAT TEAM ACTUALLY THEY GOT BIG SMILES BECAUSE THEY JUST WANT TO FIRST PLACE NATIONAL WAR THERE- TO DATE. SINCE I STARTED TWO THOUSAND THREE STARTED TRACKING THIS- WE'VE GOTTEN YOU KNOW OVER SIXTY FIVE AWARDS- THROUGH THE- THROUGH THESE COMPETITIONS. AND THESE. WERE WE HAVE STARTED RON IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE COACHES I WAS A COACH TO FOR THESE TEAMS. AND YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING UP THERE DOING OKAY BUT WE KIND OF TURNED THINGS AROUND AND REALLY MADE IT. A POWERHOUSE TEAM AND WE ARE WE GO UP THESE COMPETITIONS AND- AND SCHOOLS ARE ALWAYS LOOKING AT US AND IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE DOING TO ACCOMPLISH THAT I MEAN IT'S INCREDIBLE WE'VE- AND AWARDS HAVE GOTTEN OVER THE YEARS THERE. I JOB PLACEMENT DATA- WE HAVE HAD ON TO DROP PLACES SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN I STARTED TRACKING IT- WITH CALIFORNIA LAWYERS. US THEIR STATE IN THE STATE FOR THE MOST PART I ONCE WANTED TO COULD GO TO FLORIDA WANTS ANOTHER GO TO WASHINGTON- BUT FOR THE MOST PART THEY STAY STAY HERE CALIFORNIA. AND THEY'RE WORKING IN OUR INDUSTRY THEY'RE NOT GETTING JOBS IN OTHER INDUSTRIES. THE PAST THREE YEARS SIR TO SEE- YOU KNOW THE DEMAND IS REALLY HIGH FOR THE STUDENTS STATEWIDE- FOR THESE GRADUATES THAT- NOW EMPLOYERS ARE TRYING TO GET AHEAD OF OTHER EMPLOYERS WERE OFFERING ON SIGNING BONUSES EFFECT TO THE KIDS ARE WITH ME IN CHICAGO ONE OF THEM GOT SIGNED ON EIGHTEEN MONTHS IN ADVANCE AND GOES TUITION PAID FOR THE LAST YEAR. THAT'S HOW BAD THEY WANTED ON- THE INTERNSHIPS ARE ALL PAID INTERNSHIPS- ALL OF OUR UPPER DIVISION STUDENTS ARE INTERNING DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR. AND DURING THE SUMMER IN THEIR GRADUATING DEBT FREE WHICH IS PRETTY INCREDIBLE. SO ARM AND IT IT COMES IN AGAIN IT WASN'T LIKE THAT TWO THOUSAND THREE IT'S EVOLVED OVER TIME AND IT MOSTLY I COULD TEST IT TO THE INDUSTRY INVOLVEMENT WE HAVE A TON OF INDUSTRY THAT JUST VOLUNTEERS ARE TIME- COLLEGE CAREER FOR WE GOT A CULTURE FOR TOMORROW WE HAVE ONE EVERY SEMESTER SIXTY FIVE IN THIS IS FOR THE COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING COMPUTER SCIENCE NOT FOR THE WHOLE UNIVERSITIES SO IT'S FOCUSED ON FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS AND YOU KNOW CIVIL ENGINEERING MECHANICAL ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION COMPUTER SCIENCE. 65% EMPLOYERS WANT OUR STUDENTS AND WE'RE ONLY REPRESENTING A PERCENT OF THE COLLEGE SO IT'S OBVIOUSLY VERY HIGH DEMAND AND IT'S A GREAT TIME TO GRADUATE FOR SURE AVERAGE STARTING SALARIES TO PUT THE DATA OUT THERE- IT'S GONE UP QUITE A BIT LAST FEW YEARS BUT THE STOCK WINNER WERE. WERE LOOKING AROUND CITY FIVE THOUSAND AVERAGE SALARIES. AND IN THE- YES. A LITTLE BIT HIGHER FOR THE HIGHER COST LIVING. SO YOU'RE GOING BACK TO WHERE YOU GUYS CENTER ABOUT THE TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR I MEAN THAT EQUATES TO ABOUT THIRTY TO THIRTY FIVE FORTY DOLLARS NOW RIGHT THERE SO. AND AGAIN THAT STARTED. I GRADUATES ON ICONIC PROJECTS SO YOU KNOW THE STUDENTS TO WORK ON ANYTHING FROM RESIDENTIAL ALL THE WAY TO YOU KNOW LARGEST PROJECTS YOU CAN THINK OF- THE GOLDEN ONE CENTER DOWNTOWN HERE SACRAMENTO WE HAVE A TON OF ALUMNI ON THE PROJECT WE'RE WORKING WITH THAT OF THE ONE OF THE MIDDLE THERE IS A GIFT GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY- ONE OF THEIR PARTS OF MY JOB IS TO GO VISIT STUDENTS AFTER THEY GRADUATE AND ACTUALLY GOT QUALITY TOP OF THAT BUILDING IT IS THE TALLEST BUILDING. WEST OF CHICAGO IS NOW COMPLETE. AND UP AND THEN ANOTHER BRIT UP IN SEATTLE HAD A STUDENT WORKING FOR A MARINE CONSTRUCTION THAT'S THE ONE WHO LEFT CALIFORNIA TO SEATTLE. THE LONGEST FLOATING BRIDGE IN THE WORLD. IT'S OVER LAKE WASHINGTON- RIGHT BY BILL DOES HE WASN'T TOO HAPPY WITH THE OF THE BRIDGE THERE. BUT IT IS RIGHT NOT AREA. ARE BY FOR US THIS IS REALLY WHERE IT ALL STARTED I'LL BE HONEST IN THIS IS A- WE HAD AN INJURY RISE WERE MOST- MOST EDUCATIONAL GROUPS DO WERE YOU JUST REPORT FROM A COUPLE TIMES A YEAR OKAY THIS IS WHAT WE'RE DOING AND THEY WEREN'T REALLY ENGAGING- THOSE TYPES OF BY SUPPORTS OUR ADVICE WERE DECIDED TO THEIR IN A SUPPORTER PROGRAM. I'M HERE NINE TO TEN FOUNDERS IN THE TENTH ONE IS BEHIND YOUR EAR ROTH. IT MAKE THE PITCHER THAT DATES BUT- RON IS NOT ONLY IT JUST TO GIVE YOU A PERSPECTIVE OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE INVOLVED HE'S IN A LOT OF THE PROGRAM. HE SUPPORTS IT FINANCIALLY AND HE'S BEEN ON OUR ADVISER FORCES OR SPOUSES THE FIVE OH ONE C. THREE THAT WAS STARTED OFF CAMPUS WITH THE SUPPORT OF OUR PRESIDENT THE TIME. AND THEY HAVE THE GOAL OF JUST. ON THE PROGRAM AT IF YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY THEY WANTED TO SEE. MORE PEOPLE COLLEGE READY YET TO GO WORK FOR THE COMPANY'S MORE THAN NINE GRADUATES RIGHT. AND WE'VE DONE SO MUCH OVER THE YEARS LIKE IT'S BEEN AN HOUR JUST TALKING ABOUT THE PROGRAMS THEY SUPPORT THEIR- ARMS THE REALLY VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE THAT AND THEY'VE BEEN THE CATALYST TO DO AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS WE'VE DONE IN TERMS ACT COMPETITIONS FUNDRAISING- EXPANDING OUR PROGRAM HELPED US HIRE FACULTY- DEVELOPMENT FOR FACULTY PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. SCHOLARSHIPS AND ANDRES IS JUST IT'S ABSOLUTELY CREDIBLE AND I JUST SAID HEY YOU KNOW WHAT WE LISTEN TO THEM. I GET THEIR ADVICE THEY HELP ME WITH CURRICULA DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS RECHARGE INSTRUCT REVOLVE MAKE SURE STILL CURRENT WHAT WE'RE TEACHING- I REALLY RELY PRETTY HEAVILY ON THEIR EXPERTISE. HERE SCHOLARSHIP SEARCHES OF ONE GROUP OF SCHOLARSHIP THERE'S THE DEAN THERE AND ONE PERSON FROM OUR INVITES REPORTERS WELL. IRISH LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL SO- THESE ARE SOME PICTURES ACTUALLY JUST TAKEN LAST COUPLE WEEKS SO- I HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE WITH HIGH SCHOOLS ARE SOME LISTED pTRADE PROGRAMS GOING ON CHILDREN HIGH SCHOOL IS THE ONE YOU SEE UP FRONT YOU THERE THEY HAVE AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF SPACE. AND JEFF PARKER RUNS THAT PROGRAM IS JUST DONE A FABULOUS JOB IN. I MAKE SURE THAT I GET THE VISIBILITY TO THE STUDENTS TO DECIDE IF THEY DON'T WANT TO GO ON THE TRAYS THEY WANT TO GO THE COLLEGE ROUTE. I HELP THEM WITH THAT WE HAVE SCHOLARSHIPS AVAILABLE FOR THOSE STUDENTS WHO CHOOSE TO GO THAT ROUTE AS WELL- BUT SHOT A HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE PROGRAM HER LOCALLY ROSEMONT HIGH SCHOOL ALSO HAS A PRETTY PHENOMENAL PROGRAM. A FULL SOME HIGH SCHOOL START EXPAND THERE'S OUR BUILDING ENGINEERING BUILDING RIGHT NOW MY SON GOES ARSENAL OF ABOUT THAT PROGRAM AS WELL A LEAK IN HIGH SCHOOL DOWN THE STOCKTON ALSO VERY LARGE TRADE PROGRAM- FOR THEIR STUDENTS. AND GRANITE BAY HIGH SCHOOL- HAS A LITTLE BIT GOING ON TO WITH US. THE COLLEGE GROUP OUTSIDE. REAL QUICKLY ON THOSE AUTOMATION THERE THE SECOND HAND OUT I HAVE RUN YOU IS. IS THERE'S A THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY HERE- SO CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD- IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE PASSED A THEY GOT THIS PAST YOU LEGISLATURE K. CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT EDUCATION SPONSORSHIP BACK. AND ESSENTIALLY. THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THE CONSTRUCTION MANAGER PROGRAMS AT THE UNIVERSITY HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND THERE'S NINE OF THEM THAT ARE CREDITED YOUR CALIFORNIA- WERE UNDERFUNDED AND SO THEY HAVE THIS- THIS IDEA THAT- IT. IS S. AS CONTRACTORS RENEW THEIR LICENSE THEY CAN OPT TO GIVE AN ADDITIONAL DONATION TOWARDS THIS FUND AND WHEN THE FUN REACHES A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THEN IT'S A THEN THERE ARE ELIGIBLE TO START DISTRIBUTING GRANTS AND THE GRANTS GO DIRECTLY BACK TO THE PROGRAMS. THAT HAVE CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE AT LEAST HALF YOUR GRADUATES GO WORK FOR CALIFORNIA PORTERS YOU CAN READ OUR PERCENT SO IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL- IT IS VOLUNTARY AND- BECAUSE IT'S VOLUNTARY I THINK IT GETS MISSED A LOT AND WE NEED TO. NEED TO CONTINUE TO ADVERTISE FOR ELEVEN FLEUR NOW IT'S OUT THERE IT'S- I'M A CONTRACTOR IS WELL IT'S A FORM AT ALL RENEWAL FEE EVERY YEAR. IF AND THERE'S- ALMOST THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACTIVE CONTRACTORS RIGHT NOW. SO IF EVERY CONTRACTOR EVERY YEAR JUST GAVE ONE DOLLAR EVERY OTHER YEAR IT WOULD FUNDED EVERY YEAR- SO IT'S NOT A LHASA TELLS YOU I THINK THIS IS. WE DON'T AND WE JUST NEED TO EDUCATE THEM THAT IT'S AVAILABLE THERE OR POSSIBLY TURN INTO A FEE. WHICH WOULD BE NICE OTHER STATES DO THAT- I DO GET A CHANCE TO TRAVEL. QUITE A BIT TO OTHER PROGRAMS ACROSS UNITED STATES HERE THEY'RE DOING BECAUSE I'M ON AN ACCREDITATION WERE NATIONAL ACCREDITATION WORK. AND THEIR SCHOOLS ARE BRINGING IN. FIVE EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FROM THIS SORT OF PROGRAM FOR THE PROGRAM TO HELP FUND- EXPANDING. AND YOU KNOW SUPPLIES AND HIRING FACULTY AND SO FORTH SO. AND SOME I LIKE TO DEFINITELY CONTINUE TO PUSH. FOR THE PROGRAM- GOT SOME GREAT ACCOLADES HERE IS ONE OF OUR GRADUATES. I WAS FORTUNE OF TO BE TEACHER. THIS IS ONE OF TO GRADUATES A GRADUATE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. AND THEY SAW A NEED IN THE INDUSTRY. AND IN TWO THOUSAND TEN THEY LEFT THEIR JOBS AND- MAX OUT THEIR CREDIT CARDS IS DECIDED. TO STARTED OUT AND- ACTUALLY- GOT A START UP THE FUNDING FOR IT. AND IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THEY SOLD IT FOR EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. GOOD AMAZING. THIS IS SOME HANDS ON FACULTY LEADS YOU TO RESIST ONE BIG PROJECT THAT WE DID OVER THE LAST YOU KNOW TEN YEARS OR SO- AND- THIS IS KIND OF ACROSS MANY DISCIPLINES- YET THE UNIVERSITY TO DEVELOP THIS WE COMPETED IN A INTERNATIONAL DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY US ALREADY CATALOG WHERE YOU BASICALLY HAVE TO CREATE A HOME THAT'S- NETZERO SO YOU- YOU GENERATE MORE ENERGY THAN YOU USE AND THERE'S A SERIES OF TESTS YOU DO TO DO THAT. IT WAS A BIG THING TO TAKE ON MYSELF ONE OTHER FACULTY- LET IT AND ON THE LEFT IS THE RENDERING ON THE RIGHT IS THE ACTUAL STRUCTURE TURNED OUT VERY WELL- AND WE DID WE DID QUITE WELL IN THE COMPETITION IN FACT HERE IT IS AT THE SITE IT HAPPEN TO BE IRVINE SO TWENTY UNIVERSITIES AROUND THE WORLD. FIRST WAY SUITE IN ITS I MEAN IT WAS GREAT TO SEE SOME IS COMPETENT. I GOT THEIR STRUCTURES OVER TO UNITED STATES WAS THAT IN ITSELF WAS A FEET. UP ON THE RIGHT THERE IS THE SECTOR THE BERMAN VANITY OR IF THERE AND- YOU KNOW WITH US IN OUR STUDENTS ON OUR- DECK ON OUR HOME. THOSE PRETTY EXCITING PROJECT. THAT'S IT FOR ME SO THANK YOU CHAIR FOR HAVING US TODAY AND- I HOPE THE BILL HAVE MORE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH A GREAT RECITATION APPRECIATED- I DON'T KNOW OR YOU COULD GO IN AND RIGHT ON THE SIDE. THIS IS GAVE OUT HERE. FOR ENERGY THE I. THANK YOU YEAH. OKAY AND THIS IS WORKING AGES AT THE BUTTON HERE. ONCE YOU YARDAGE OF RUN HERE. ALL RIGHT THANKS YOU WANT THIS ONE. I THINK I GOT THIS ONE. OF THE JUST PUSHED WRONG YOU. ALL THIS WHEN THEY'RE NOT ON. THAT RIGHT GOT IT OKAY THANK YOU. LOVE SEX DATE YEAH YEAH. I'M ALUMNI SO RIGHT ON SEX DATE AS WONDERFUL PROGRAM- AND SO MY NAME IS SIMEON GANT AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE- I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND FOUNDER OF THE PROGRAM WE CALL GREEN. TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT- WE TAKE A- YOU KNOW AFTER EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN SAID- YOU KNOW GREEN TECH- HAS KIND OF FOLLOWED SUIT ON THAT AND WE DO TAKE A MORE GRASSROOTS APPROACH SINCE. TWO THOUSAND AND SIX WHEN THEY PASSED ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY TWO. THE GLOBAL WARMING- SOLUTIONS ACT GREEN TECH- YOU KNOW WE THOUGHT THAT THE- YOUNG PEOPLE REALLY TO GET OPPORTUNITY TO KIND OF FIGURE OUT. OF WHICH DIRECTION THEY CAN GO IN- IN THIS NEW- ENVIRONMENTAL- WORLD RIGHT- WE'RE GONNA PROTECT OUR ENVIRONMENT HOWEVER WE'RE GONNA DO IT THROUGH OUR INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT- ESSENTIALLY WE LOOKED AT- HOW. A LOT OF THESE YOUNG FOLKS DON'T REALIZE THAT. YOU KNOW FOLKS ARE AGING OUT THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IT NEEDS NEW BLOOD THEY NEED NEW PEOPLE TO COME IN BUT THE- VOCABULARY CHANGING- YOU KNOW BEFORE ALL OF THIS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT CARBON FOOTPRINT WAS WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE CARBON FOOTPRINT. WE TALK ABOUT AN ANAEROBIC DIGESTION WE DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THINGS LIKE- WE CAN USE WASTE TO CREATE FUEL- AND THERE'S JOBS AND OPPORTUNITIES THERE- AND SO WHAT WE DO NOW WITH GREEN TECH IS WE BRING IN YOUNG FOLKS AGES. SIXTEEN TO TWENTY ONE. AND WE TEACH THEM A CAREER OPPORTUNITIES IN CLEAN ENERGY. ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND SUSTAINABLE LIVING STRATEGIES AND WE TALK TO OUR STUDENTS ABOUT- WITH SUSTAINABLE LIVING MEANS WE TALK TO THEM ABOUT GROWING THEIR OWN FOOD. WE TALK TO THEM ABOUT HEALTHY MAKING HEALTHY DECISIONS WE TALK TO THEM ABOUT CONSTRUCTION YOU COULD ACTUALLY LITERALLY BUILD YOUR OWN HOUSE. AND SO WE TALKED TO THEM ABOUT THE SUSTAINABLE ENERGY ARE SUSTAINABLE LIVING STRATEGIES BUT THEN THERE'S ALSO- HOW DO WE REDUCE THE FOSSIL FUEL ENERGY. RIGHT THAT WERE USING AND SO WE TALK TO THEM ABOUT- RENEWABLE ENERGY SOLAR. WIND WATER TURNING WASTE INTO. I'M FEEL. PACIFIC LEE IN AREAS OF CONSTRUCTION. TRANSPORTATION MANUFACTURING. UTILITIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT NO WE RECOGNIZE THAT A LOT OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE NEVER KNOWN AS EVER TOLD HIM IN HIGH SCHOOL THAT YOU COULD GET A GOOD JOB AND- UTILITIES INDUSTRY. AND WITH UTILITIES INDUSTRY GOING MORE SOLAR. ON WHETHER THEY WANT TO OR NOT. RIGHT THEY THEY'RE DOING IT- CURRENTLY WE HAVE A BIG PROJECT- WHERE WE ARE INSTALLING ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS. AND SO ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE WITH THE STUDENTS AROUND TOWN. IT'S JUST GETTING THEM TO WORK SITES. AND SO WE'RE WORKING WITH THE AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT IN THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. TO DO A FROM A NONPROFIT A COMMUNITY BASED PERSPECTIVE. HAVE AN ACTUAL ELECTRIC VEHICLE TRANSPORTATION CENTER. SO NOW WE ALSO CREATING JOBS WE'RE ALSO GETTING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AROUND TOWN TO WORK SITES- WITH ZERO EMISSIONS. AND SO. WE GOT TO MAKE A GREEN AND SEXY. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT RIDE AS BEEN MENTIONED ALL DAY LONG YOU KNOW ALLOW YOUNG FOLKS DON'T WANT TO GOING TO CONSTRUCTION. WHEN THE WAY SOME OF THE WAYS THAT WE TRY TO MAKE IT SEXY IS TRIED WE HAVE TOURS WE'VE TAKEN I'M ON- WE'VE TAKEN HIM TO THE GOLDEN ONE CENTER WHEN IT WAS STILL BEING BUILT. WE'VE TAKEN THEM TO THE ANAEROBIC DIGESTION WE TAKE ON THE GOOGLE WE'VE TAKEN TO ALL THESE DIFFERENT PLACES TO TRY TO ENCOURAGE THEM YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND OF COURSE THEY KIND OF FROWNED AT WHEN THEY THINK ABOUT THE PRIUS. SO WE BROUGHT THEM A TESLA. WE'VE TAKEN THEM TO THE TEST LE PLANT SO THAT THEY CAN SEE THE JOB OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE THERE. WE GIVEN HANDS ON PROJECTS. WE PROVIDE THEM WITH STIPENDS AND WE PROVIDE THEM WITH HOPE. A LOT OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE- SOCIAL EMOTIONAL ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO WORK WITH AS WELL- ONE OF THE HANDS ON PROJECTS THAT WE HAVE IS CALLED THE SOLAR SUITCASE. SOLIS THROUGH CASE GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE INTRODUCED TO ELECTRICAL CIRCUITRY. AND SOLAR TECHNOLOGY. THE BILL THIS PORTABLE LIGHTING SYSTEM THAT'S POWERED BY THE SUN. AND THEN WE SEND IT TO PLACES LIKE HAITI IN AFRICA WHERE THEY ACTUALLY NEED THE LIGHT HAVE A POOR GRID SYSTEMS AND SO WE'RE OUT GIVING THE STUDENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE- PHILANTHROPIST AND SO IN SOME FORM. AS WELL ON TO GIVE HIM AND JUST TRY HER BEST TO AGAIN MAKE THAT MAKE IT SEXY ARMS WE ALSO PROVIDE THEM WITH SOFT SKILLS- WE HAVE RESUME WRITING- SESSIONS INTERVIEW TECHNIQUES TIME MANAGEMENT. AND BUDGETING. SO I MENTION THE FIVE ELEMENTS OF GREENTECH A CONSTRUCTION SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT- TRANSPORTATION UTILITIES. MANUFACTURING ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT. LOT OF AGRICULTURE WE DO A LOT OF AGRICULTURE IN SOMETHING CALLED AQUACULTURE WE HAVE SOMETHING CALLED AQUAPONICS A ONE THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT GREENHOUSE ARM ON PROPERTY HERE AT OAK PARK IN SACRAMENTO AND WE'RE TEACHING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE HOW TO GROW. FOOD VEGETABLES LETTUCE- IN IN THIS AQUA AQUAPONICS SYSTEM- WE ALSO PROVIDE THEM UNDERSTANDING OF ECOLOGY LIFE SCIENCES- LANDSCAPING AND WASTE MANAGEMENT. AND SO ARM. OF IT IS YOU KNOW JUST KIND OF KEEPING THEM INTERESTED- WE DO PROVIDE- WEATHERIZATION TRAINING TEACHING THEM THE INSIDE OF A BUILDING BUILDING SCIENCES- AS WE GROW WE REALIZE THAT MC THREE IS THE STANDARD AND YOU KNOW WE NEED FUNDS AND WE NEED OPPORTUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO BRING IN INSTRUCTORS WHO CAN TEACH OUR STUDENTS AND KIND OF MOVING FROM A GRASSROOTS LEVEL TOOL MORE FORMALIZED- LEVEL. I'M WE DO DISCUSS OUR- GETTING INTO COLLEGE WITH OUR STUDENTS- WE HAVE SOMEONE ON OUR TEAM WHO- WORKS AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE ARE PARTNERED WITH THE CONSUMERS RIVER COLLEGE AND SO WE TRY TO DO THAT WARM HAND OFF- AND BRING THEM STRAIGHT FROM- WORKING IN HIGH SCHOOL AND WORKING ON OUR FARM- AND GETTING THEM RIGHT INTO COLLEGE. SO WE ALSO CONSIDER ENTREPRENEURSHIP SO THEY'RE LEARNING- HAD A BILL PLANTER BOXES IN THE LEARNING HOW TO GROW FOOD AND SO WILL TAKE THEM TO THE FARMERS MARKET AND SAY LOOK. OF FROM BEGINNING TO END THIS IS ARE YOU CAN ACTUALLY MAKE MONEY- AND THIS IS JUST A- A MODEL. YOU CAN LEARN HOW TO DO THIS THIS WAY YOU CAN LEARN HOW T BUILD YOUR OWN BUSINESS DOING ANYTHING ONCE YOU'VE DONE IT A FEW TIMES. ARE WE TAKING THEM TO THESE TRIPS THIS ONE IN PARTICULAR. IS AT THE REGIONAL TRANSIT LIGHT RAIL MAINTENANCE YARD. EVERY TIME WE TAKE OUR STUDENTS TO THIS- AINTENANCE ARE FOR THE LIGHT RAIL- THE GENTLEMAN THERE KERRY TELLS IS THERE'S TONS OF JOBS AVAILABLE AND SO WE JUST WANT TO GET OUR STUDENTS KIND OF PREPARED AND READY FOR THOSE PARTICULAR JOBS. AS I MENTIONED BEFORE UTILITY COMPANIES PUBLIC TRANSIT COMPANIES MANUFACTURING PLANTS CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES IN EVEN A GOVERNMENT JOBS BUT WE ALSO- WE ALSO LET THEM KNOW THAT THEY HAVE OPPORTUNITIES IN THIS TRADE SCHOOLS AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AS WELL THIS IS ONE OF OUR- A SOLAR SUIT CASE PROJECTS. ON THE LEFT WITH OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH A CONSUMERS RIVER COLLEGE AND ON THE RIGHT THAT WAS- A SOLIS TO CASE THAT WE SENT TO PORTER RICO- ON THEIR ONE OF THEIR LATEST- ON WHETHER. CATASTROPHES. SO AGAIN ON THE ON THE ENTREPRENEURSHIP OPPORTUNITIES WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT THEY THESE ARE TRANSFERABLE SKILLS- THEY CAN DO LANDSCAPE BUSINESSES THEY CAN DO URBAN FORESTRY ENTRY SERVICES- HOME IMPROVEMENT- SOLAR ELECTRICAL AGE BACK AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY CONSULTING- AND OF COURSE WE'VE GOT A WE'VE GOT A FARM STAND. AND SO- ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS I DIDN'T MENTION IS THAT WE ALSO TEACH COMPUTER CODING- OUR GOAL IS TO KIND OF MAILED AND MERGE SOME OF THE- KIND OF CONSTRUCTION- JOBS IN THE FARMING JOBS WITH OUR COMPUTER CODING AND BUILDING APPS AND THAT SORT OF THING- THE BIG PROJECT OF COURSE IS THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATION. AND OUR GOAL IS TO BUILD AN APT TO- CREATE A RIGHT HILL ON PROGRAM IN THE COMMUNITY OF DEL PASO HEIGHTS. SO WE HAVE BEEN BILLED PLANTER BOXES- AS INTRODUCTION ON HOW TO BUILD. YOU KNOW A LOT OF THEM DON'T KNOW- YOU KNOW HOW TO. USE A TAPE MEASURE BUT WHEN THEY LEAVE GREEN TECH THEY KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A HAMMER AND INNOCENT- DRILL. AND A SAW. WE DO HAVE TO IDENTIFICATION TESTING WE ALSO DO- SHOULD TEN TRAINING AND CPR TRAINING AS WELL. AND THAT'S ALL THAT IS OUR- PROPERTY IN OAK PARK ALL THIS THE STUDENTS OF BILL BOTH PLANTER BOXES- DAVE- PLANET THE- THOSE VEGETABLES. AND INSIDE THAT US- GREENHOUSE IS A THREE OF OUR AQUAPONICS SYSTEMS. THANK YOU. SO IS YOUR PROGRAM- AN AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMMERS IN AN ALTERNATIVE EDUCATION PROGRAM OR OR HOW IT HOW IT HOW ARE YOU FUNDED IN WHAT WHAT HOW DO YOU GET THE KIDS CERTAINLY SO. WE DO BOTH AFTER SCHOOL ON SATURDAY MORNINGS. NAM AFTER SCHOOL THREE THIRTY OF THE STUDENTS COMMON WE DO OUR AGRICULTURE PROGRAM. AND THEN SATURDAY MORNINGS WERE DOING A LOT OF- URBAN FORESTRY AND- LANDSCAPING AS WELL AS- WOOD WORKING ON SATURDAY MORNINGS- THE STUDENTS IS VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE WE GIVE STIPENDS. A LOT OF WORD OF MOUTH- HOWEVER WE DO HAVE A CONTRACT WITH THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. AND SO YOU KNOW A LOT OF WHAT'S BEEN TALKED TODAY. IS THE FIRST THING TWO WORDS THE TRADITIONAL SCHOOLS AND THAT'SGREAT HOWEVER A LOT OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE NOT MAKING IT IN THESE TRADITIONAL SCHOOLS RIGHT. AND SO WE'RE DOING OUTREACH TO STUDENTS WHO ARE TRADITIONALLY- ON THE EDGES. AND WE BRING THEM IN AND WE MAKE IT SEXY. WE BRING THE MEN WE TALK ABOUT WAYS THAT THEY CAN MAKE IT. AND SO IT'S A RECRUITING PROCESS- OUR FUNDING COMES FROM SCULLY OUR FUNDING COMES FROM GRANTS WE HAVE A GRANT WITH THE ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AGENCY THE STATE AND THE EPA. ON ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE PROGRAM. COMMENTS WE CODDLE THESE FUNDS TO OTHER TO TRY PROVIDE FUNDING TO OUR INTEREST OWNERS. YOUNG PEOPLE MATERIALS BE. ABLE TO DO THE PROJECTS AND THEY THEY GET AT. CREDIT FOR SCHOOL THE STUDENTS FROM SCHOOL WITH THE CATHOLIC. THE OFFICE OF EDUCATION THEY DO GET CREDIT YEAH IT'S LIKE THAT ARE. INDEPENDENT STUDIES. SO YES SOME OF OUR STUDENTS ARE ABSOLUTELY ON INDEPENDENT STUDIES AND HOME STUDIES. YEAH I'M I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THAT'S- PART OF I THINK. THE OPPORTUNITY IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO WITH IT THE- HEAD COACH TO PROVIDE THE FLEXIBILITY FOR SOME OF THESE MODELS AND. I HAVE DONE IN A NUMBER OF TOURS AND I AM JUST REALLY IMPRESSED WITH THE NUMBER OF HIGH SCHOOLS THAT ARE DOING TOOL PROGRAMS WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND HAVE. IGNITED YOUNG PEOPLE. TO COULD GO THE EXTRA MILE TO BE ABLE TO GRADUATE WITH AN EIGHTY AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE GRADUATING WITH A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA AND I- I'M I GUESS I STRUGGLE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY ISN'T EVERYBODY DOING THIS RIGHT- AND LOOKING AT OPPORTUNITIES TO BRING IN NONTRADITIONAL KIDS GET A LOT OF KIDS DON'T LEARN BY SITTING AT A DESK AND BEING QUIET YEAH AND- FRANKLY MANY OF THEM GET MOVED OFF TO SOME OTHER PLACE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T SIT QUIETLY AND YET IF YOU PUT A MINUTE ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY'RE WORKING WITH THEIR HANDS. OR THEY'RE WORKING AS A TEAM THEN THEY CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND IT'S NOT IT'S A DIFFERENT MODALITIES HAVE SO- I'M I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT WAYS THAT WE CAN INCENTIVIZE THAT KIND OF CREATIVITY AND. TRY TO BUILD AN OPPORTUNITY FOR KIDS TO BE ABLE TO TRY EVERYTHING. SO THAT THEY CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT THE LIKE ABSOLUTE AND WE CAN ENCOURAGE THEM TO START THINKING ABOUT THAT A LOT EARLIER THAN WE'RE DOING. WE'RE DOING NOW. YES IN THE- SO WHY AM I I'M NOT SURE I HAVE A CLUE. WELL I GUESS MY QUESTION IS- ARE THERE OBSTACLES TO THE DUAL ENROLLMENT PROGRAM. THAT WOULD BE THAT THAT WE COULD BE HELPFUL FOR NUMBER ONE IS OUR OBSTACLES AND NUMBER TWO IS ONE OF THOSE OBSTACLES MONEY- AND ARE THERE. CHANGES TO THE END COULD THAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER IN ORDER TO. TO TRY TO INCENTIVIZE MORE MORE STUDENTS GOING INTO- THE TRADE I A I KNOW THAT FOR A WHILE. THERE THERE WAS TRACKING GOING ON IN THAT THAT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THAT. THAT WE CHANGE THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM SO IT BECAME MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO TRACK BUT IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT WE WENT WE SWUNG SO FAR AWAY FROM- FROM KERR AGING SOME OF SOME F THE- VOCATIONAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS THAT THAT STUDENTS HAVE LOST THE ABILITY TO THINK THAT THAT'S A GOOD PATHWAY. SO I'M I'M I'M I GUESS I'M LOOKING AT IS THERE IS THERE ARE THERE ARE CHALLENGES TO THE DUAL ENROLLMENT AND ARE THE THINGS WE NEED TO DO. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF CHALLENGES ONE IS IT HAS TO DO WITH THE AND- AND I'M SPEAKING FROM LIMITED KNOWLEDGE GIVEN I'M ONLY BEING HUNDRED DAYS AND CALIFORNIA IN MY POSITION SO. IT BEAR WITH ME ON THAT. I FOR ONE CHALLENGES OF COURSE IS A CLASS SCHEDULE IN THE HIGH SCHOOL THAT REALLY HAS TO DO WITH. BECAUSE IT MAY REQUIRE THEIR DISC TO THAN TO GO ELSEWHERE TO GET THOSE TO A LENORMAND COURSE SO THAT'S WHEN SHELVE FUNDING YES IS A PROBLEM. BUT I THINK. A LOT OF THE- DUAL ENROLLMENT THAT IS HAPPENING AND CALIFORNIA'S NON UNIQUE IN THIS. IT IS HAPPENING BETWEEN. A RELATIONSHIP WHICH IS GOOD THAT IS BUILT BETWEEN THE INSTRUCTOR AT THE HIGH- THAT AND TEACHER AT THE HIGH SCHOOL IN THE INSTRUCTED THE COMMUNICATE LIKE IT DOESN'T GET BECOME SYSTEMATIC AND THAT'S WHAT I'VE- IS SO I MEAN I WOULD RIDE THE STATE I CAME FROM WAS THE IOWA. AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT DAD DOES ACTUALLY IS. IT WAS PUT INTO THE I WILL CALL TO HOW THEY WOULD FIND SYSTEMATICALLY DUAL ENROLLMENT SO I AT THAT WOULD DOES IT DID TO A DIVISION THAT THE THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE MY SUGGESTION BUT I THINK PART OF IT IS SIMPLY. SYSTEM MY SISTER DIES IN THAT WE GET WE AT CITY HALL AT COLLEGE GOING COURSES THAT INCLUDES NOT ONLY BULLARD ALMOND BUT IT CAN INCLUDE ARTICULATE AND IT DOES INCLUDE SOME OF THE A. P. AND IB COURSES AT THAT ARE THERE. AND YOUR OUT I TRADITION STUDENTS ARE I. PLAYED TO LOOK AT IS REALLY THE FUNDING MY DEBT FROM ME AND I MIGHT BE. THIN FLEXIBLE BEFORE FOR TOM FOR. I'VE BEEN TOLD I MAKE IT. YEAH ABSOLUTELY. I'M I JUST ON THE DUAL ENROLLMENT ISSUE AYE AYE AND EVERY STATE'S DIFFERENT BUT YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE IN THEIR WISDOM IN THE GOVERNOR NOW CREATED- TUITION FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO WE'RE FINDING STUDENTS AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL IN THE COURSE WORK THAT THEY TAKE IT NO COST AND WE CERTAINLY ARE DOING THAT IN THE HIGH SCHOOLS AND SO IT SEEMS LIKE AT AGAIN I HEAR ISSUES ABOUT FUNDING- WHO FINDS THE TEXTBOOK- WHERE IT'S LOCATED IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THAT THAT'S A BIG BARRIER THAT'S BEEN REMOVED NOW AND NOW WE NEED TO GET SYSTEMS TOGETHER SILENCE AND ACTUALLY JUST THINK ABOUT THE KIDS WHAT'S- FOR THE KIDS. WHERE IT HAPPENS YOUR PLACE MY PLACE AND I JUST WANT TO SAY TO THE CHAIR THAT ANY KIND OF WORK IN THIS YEAR I'D LOVE TO TRY TO PARTNER AND BE SUPPORTIVE BECAUSE I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF THIS IDEA OF THIS THERE ONE WAY THERE'S ONE TRACK FOR A STUDENT AND- I THINK THAT THAT THERE THERE ARE STUDENTS THAT ARE ENTERING HIGH SCHOOL THAT COULD BEGIN COLLEGE AND A BA DO ON ALL THAT WE HAVE TO GO. AT THEM AS THEY ARE AND FIND THE BEST WAY FOR THEM TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND HAPPY PROSPER AND I THINK THAT THE SILOS CAN GET IN THE WAY BUT SOMETIMES THAT MEANS WE NEED SOME SMART LEGISLATORS. WELL I WITH SOME GREAT PARTNERS TO FIND A WAY THROUGH. IT SAID THAT THE OUR FOCUS ON WHAT MATTERS. MAY I ADD ONE MORE THING TITLE. WHEN DOLAN MOMENT HAPPENS TYPICALLY IT'S AROUND THE WHAT I WOULD CALL THE ACADEMIC COURSES BECAUSE STUDENTS ARE LOOKING TO THE A TO G. TRYING TO MEET THOSE REQUIREMENTS I THINK THERE HAS TO BE SORT OF MORE EMPHASIS OF INVOLVING C. T. IN THIS PROCESS OF DUAL ENROLLMENT AS WELL. I APPRECIATE THAT AND I DO AGREE AND I AGREE WITH. AS SENATOR GLAZIER IT'S- THE IT'S THE REASON I ASK THE QUESTION IS THAT. THERE USED TO BE A LIMIT ON HOW MANY COURSES A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT. COULD TAKE AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN. SATISFACTION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL REQUIREMENTS AND THE REASON WHY SAYS THEY WANTED KIDS TO STAY IN THE HIGH SCHOOL AND NOT TO BE TAKING UP THE STUFF THAT'S IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AT LEAST THAT'S HOW IT WAS REPORTED TO ME. BUT NOW AND I THINK WELL ACTUALLY I CAN'T SAY FOR SURE BUT BUT NOW I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S THAT THAT WE HAVE WE HAVE- MADE IT A LOT EASIER TO GO TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. FIRST STUDENTS THAT WERE CLEAN- FINANCIALLY. AND THE ABILITY TO ACTUALLY DO BOTH. AT THE SAME TIME COULD BE. VERY VERY IMPORTANT. AND IF I MAY IN RESPONSE THE D. A. YES. BUT THINK ABOUT IT THAT IF YOU HAVE A STUDENT THAT'S WHAT IT'S CAPABLE AND WILLING TO GO TAKE A COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL COURSES- EARLY- THAT THAT WHAT THEY GET OUT OF IT IS. THOUGHT ABOUT A TO G. ANYMORE BECAUSE THEY AT THE END OF THEIR FOUR YEARS. THERE AND ABILITY TO TRANSFER TO A FOUR YEAR BECAUSE THEY'VE COMPLETED. THE SIXTY UNITS OF GENERAL EDUCATION AT THE OLLEGE LEVEL. SO THE WHOLE A THROUGH G. ISSUE CAN GONNA GET IN THE WAY OF WHAT THAT REALLY CAN ACCOMPLISH THAT MEANS THAT THAT. NOW GRADUATING HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT IS ABLE TO STAVE TWO YEARS OF COLLEGE TIME AND MONEY. AND BE ABLE TO TRANSFER IF THEY IF IT'S APPROPRIATE OR IT COULD BE THAT THROUGH A TRADE WHERE IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE. THEY'VE COMPLETED BUT THERE'S HUGH ENORMOUS SAVINGS FOR THE STUDENT AND FOR THE STATE TO STATE IF WE CAN DO IT CORRECTLY SO IT'S A- I KNOW THE AB IS A STICKLER. BUT KIDS ORG. THAT IS A DIFFERENT TRACK AT DIFFERENT PURPOSE BUT DIE I THINK THESE THINGS CAN BE WORKED. OUT IF WE STAY FOCUSED ON WHAT MATTER. I DO AGREE. DID YOU. ANY ANY OTHER COMMENTS TO THE TO THE DUAL ENROLLMENT OUR OR OUR OR THINGS THAT WE NEED TO CHANGE I DO APPRECIATE YOU COMING WITH SOME TASKS- WORK TO DO- BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY WERE WHERE WE WANT TO GO NEXT IS WHAT WHAT OUR NEXT STEPS IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT AT THIS ISSUE AND WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT. THAT THAT WE CAN DO HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE- BOTH IN TERMS OF IN A BUT IN A BUDGET- AS WE LOOK AT THE BUDGET BUT ALSO AS WE LOOK AT. AT THE REQUIREMENTS MAKING SURE THAT WE WANT TO THAT WE CAN INCENTIVIZE DUTIES. I THINK IT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER YOU KNOW AT LEAST YOU KNOW FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE TO PROVIDE MORE ASSISTANCE TO THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WHO CAN WORK WITH THE SCHOOLS- YOU KNOW I THINK THAT AGAIN AS YOU MENTIONED YOU KNOW IN THE PAST THERE WAS SOME TRACKING ISSUES RIGHT BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED- IT WOULD. YOU KNOW MORE MORE PEOPLE ARE DROPPING OUT OF SCHOOL AND SO WE JUST GONNA SHRUG OUR SHOULDERS- YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO REALLY KIND OF FOCUS AND- SAY LET'S BRING THEM BACK AND- IF WE CAN GET MORE- SUPPORT RESOURCES AND FUNDING TO DO THAT AND SAY WE'RE IN THE COMMUNITY. WE KNOW WHERE THEY ARE AND WE KNOW HOW TO WORK WITH THEM- WE CAN EITHER- WORK WITH THEM TO GIVE THEM TRAINING AND OR BRING THEM BACK INTO THE SCHOOLS. YEAH I. AM A NOTATION IN TERMS OF FUNDING FOR THAT FIVE OH ONE C. THREE THAT'S ALWAYS AT. A BIG ISSUE AND I APPRECIATE. APPRECIATE THAT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE SCHOOLS IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE PARTNERS THAT ARE ARE PART OF THAT. THE TEAM AS WELL. YEAH MY BOSS WOULD HAVE WANTED ME TO MAKE THAT PLUG. YOU DID I HAVE WRITTEN DOWN AND I. DO APPRECIATE IT AND I THINK THAT. THE BIGGER PICTURE AS WELL AND I WAS LOOKING AT IT ONE OF THE REPORTS WE HAD HERE. TALKED ABOUT THE- THAT THE CHALLENGE OF CALIFORNIA- AND FACES IN REGARDS TO THE NUMBER OF ADULTS THAT OVER SIXTEEN THAT ARE WORKING OR LOOKING FOR WORK. THAT NUMBER IS PARTICULARLY HIGH IN THE STATE CAN ACTUALLY I THINK IT'S THE HIGHEST IN THE THIS IS THE STATE WHERE IT'S THE HIGHEST AND- THAT THAT DATA TELLS US THAT THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE THAT- FOR. FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER AND I TO CONTRIBUTING TO THE ECONOMY AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DROP OUT RATE- IT WE- WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET. THOSE PEOPLE BACK INTO THE ECONOMY AND SO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT HIGH SCHOOL IT'S ABOUT. GRAHAM SAID BRING THE MEN. LOOK LIKE THAT LIKE THAT. WHICH IS DOING IS BRINGING THE MEN AND GIVING THEM THAT THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO BE SUCCESSFUL. SO ON APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY THERE ARE NO MORE QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HELPING US TO SORT THROUGH THIS AND FIGURE OUT. WHAT WE NEED TO DO NEXT THANK YOU. VERY MUCH. I YES ACTUALLY I DO I. AM NOT LOOKING AT MY AGENDA SO THAT THIS IS THE TIME FOR PUBLIC COMMENT IF THERE'S ANYONE THAT WOULD LIKE TO MAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ONE INVITE YOU. TO COME IN THE PANEL A YEAR FREE TO GO. THANK YOU SO MUCH. YES SIR. YES MY NAME'S MARK I'VE SEEN I AM DIRECTOR THAT CALIFORNIAN VIA MENTAL TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION NETWORK AND I WANT TO. TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO. FILL IN SOME BLANKS AS THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAD OF THIS PANEL- AND I THINK A LOT OF NOT BEING COMPLETE IS THAT. THIS GOES BACK MANY YEARS THAT THEY PROBABLY DON'T HAVE. AN INSTITUTIONAL MEMORY- THE ISSUE ON A THROUGH G. THE TUNNEL VISION OF THE HIGH SCHOOLS TO FOUR YEAR COLLEGE HAS BEEN A PROBLEM FOR MANY YEARS- IT REALLY WAS SEEN AS BEGINNING A PROBLEM AFTER BEGINNING OF THE CENTURY. AND BACK IT TO TRY TO ANSWER THAT IN DEAL WITH THAT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE. THE LEGISLATURE PASSED SB SEVENTY CARRIED BY SENATOR JACK'S GOT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE AWARE ON THAT. BILL WHICH WAS- LISTED. WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO CREATE A SEAMLESS TRANSITION FROM HIGH SCHOOL. TO THE COP COMMUNITY COLLEGE. FOR CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. IN THE BOTTOM LINE INTENT OF WHAT. WAS BEING SOUGHT AFTER WAS FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM FOR VARIOUS. I'M INDUSTRY CAREER PATHWAYS TO CREATE. A SEQUENCE OF COLLEGE PREPARATORY COURSES FOR THE HIGH SCHOOL. TO BE AN ALTERNATIVE TO A THROUGH G. AND TO COMPETE FOR THAT. NOW THAT BILL HAD A FIVE YEAR LIFESPAN IT WAS RENEWED IN TWENTY TEN. BY SENATOR STEINBERG FOR ANOTHER FIVE YEARS. AND DURING THAT TEN YEARS. THE STATE LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATED GOING WITH THOSE BILLS AND SOME OTHER- ONES THAT WERE ATTACHED TO THAT WHOLE PROGRAM. CLOSE TO BILLION DOLLARS AND WE NEVER SAW. SEQUENCE WE NEVER HELD AN ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. SO THAT WAS ONE HEARING NOW IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WHEN I WAS LOOKING TO COME FOR A THIRD RENEWAL CENTER LEYVA WAS GOING TO CARRY THAT OUT BUT WHEN IT BECAME EVIDENT THAT THE CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS WERE GOING TO OPPOSE THAT BILL WITHOUT PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CANCERS OFFICE IT SENATOR. LEYVA IN THE POWERS THAT BE DROPPED THAT BILL BUT THE FUNDING THAT WENT ALONG WITH THAT HAS CONTINUED AS A BUDGET LINE ITEM. AND ACTUALLY WITH THAT WHEN THAT OCCURRED IN WITH THE- WE HAVE WE HAVE WITH THE- HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS IN OPPOSITION WITH THAT FINDING PIPELINE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CANCERS OFFICE RETALIATED AGAINST THE HIGH SCHOOLS BY. BY ELIMINATING AS PART OF THAT APPROPRIATIONS THE FUNDS THAT THEY WERE GIVEN TO SUPPORT PARTNERSHIP ACADEMIES WHICH WOUND UP WITH THE LEGISLATURE CREATING ANOTHER APPROPRIATION TO CONTINUE THE FUNDING FOR THE THOSE. ACADEMIES THAT WERE FUNDED UNDER SB TEN SEVEN DAY. SELL ANOTHER ISSUE THAT WAS ON THAT AS FAR AS I'M HOLD DUAL ENROLLMENT AS FAR AS ON THAT AND ONE OF THINGS THAT AGAIN THAT WASBEING ADVOCATED FROM THE TRENCHES THE HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS WISE FOR ARTICULATION AGREEMENT REFORM. THE REALITY IS THAT DUAL ENROLLMENT IS NOT GOING TO HAVE THE EFFECTIVENESS THAT IS GOING TO BE NEEDED TO FIT AND THE CULTURE OF THE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN HIGH SCHOOLS WHAT IS REALLY NEEDED IT IS ARTICULATION AGREEMENT REFORM. AS FAR AS ON ACT A. S. IS ON% IT'S A VAT IS. A BIG THING THAT- GOES ALONG WITH WITH THAT AS AS FAR. AS I NEED- WHAT I WOULD SAY IN GENERAL FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF DEALING WITH SCHOOLS AND BEING AND HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOMS. IS RIGHT NOW WITH A LOT OF THINGS GOING THE REPETITIVE TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IS REALLY OUR K. TWELVE IS DOING A MISERABLE JOB. OF PREPARING OUR CURRENT CROP OF STUDENTS FOR THE NEEDS OF Vì NOT THE TECHNOLOGY I MEAN WITH A LOT OF THE ECONOMIC AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS THAT I GO TO THEY TALK ABOUT BY THE MIDDLE OF THIS CENTURY THE WORK FORCE IS GOING TO LOOK VERY MUCH. LIKE A 50% OF SOME SORT OF INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR TYPE SITUATION. AND EVERY TIME I K. TWELVE HAS A DECISION TO PROVIDE THAT TYPE OF CULTURE TO FUNCTION AND THAT TYPE OF WORK FORCE ENVIRONMENT AS I'VE BEEN AROUND I WATCHED KATE TWELVE INSTITUTIONALLY. MAKE THE WRONG DECISIONS NOT PROVIDING SELF MOTIVATION THAT THE INDEPENDENCE THE RESILIENCY THAT IS NEEDED. SOUTH FOR SHEET THAT THAT HISTORY IT'S ALWAYS MUCH MORE COMPLICATED THAN YOU THINK IT IS RIGHT AS FAR AS ON YOUR TASK LESS AS FAR AS YOU KNOW HAVING AN AWARENESS OF WHAT HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE AND WHERE IT HAD FELT DEFICIENT. I THINK NEEDS TO BE PAY ATTENTION BEFORE WE SEND ANOTHER TEN YEARS AND ANOTHER BILLION DOLLARS I'M REPEATING WHAT HAS NOT WORKED IN THE PAST RIGHT. SHEET THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. HYDRO KIRK I REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS. IN TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION. TRY TO BE BRIEF I FIRST WANT TO COMMEND. V. COMMITTEE TODAY FOR HALF OPENING UP THIS CONVERSATION IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT MANUFACTURING IS ONE OF THOSE INDUSTRIES- THAT IS SUFFERING FROM A SIGNIFICANT SKILLS GAP- BUT WE'RE ALSO ONE OF THE INDUSTRIES THAT IT'S BOTH MAKING AND USING THE TECHNOLOGY THAT IS TRANSFORMING OUR FUTURE WORKFORCE WE OCCUPY AN INTERESTING POSITION IN THIS CONVERSATION WE WANTED TO AGAIN COMMEND THE COMMITTEE FOR STARTING THIS CONVERSATION WITH HOUSING- FOR MANUFACTURING- IT IT'S SOMETHING THAT- IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ANY DRIVES INVESTMENTS- IN WE PAY OUR WORKERS ON AVERAGE JUST UNDER NINETY K. YEAR OFTEN WELL INTO THE SIX FIGURES. HOWEVER SOME PARTS OF THE CITY THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT ARE WAIT FOR THE FAMILY- OVER A MODEST HOME A CAR AND OTHER NECESSITIES- AND THIS MEANS THAT MANUFACTURES CAPABLE SORT OF WELL PAID JOBS WITH BENEFITS- WITH LOW. IS OF ENTRY. TO WORK IS THAT NEED SKILLS IN ANY TRAINING- AND THAT'S OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT I TRADING OUR FUTURE WORKFORCE BECAUSE- OF FOR MANY INDUSTRIES LIKE MANUFACTURING A LOT OF OUR TRAINING IS DONE IN HOUSE OF WE CAN'T. ARE INVESTING COMMUNITIES AND THE BILL THESE FACILITIES TO TRAIN WORKERS I WORK CRITICAL PIECE OF THE PUZZLE THAT ISN'T PROVIDING THE TRAINING THAT WE ALL MEET. AT THE STATE MEET. AS PART OF THAT CONVERSATION FLOWING FROM THE CONVERSATION WE WOULD ENCOURAGE AT FOLKS IS THERE CONSIDERING- AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO CONSIDER MANUFACTURING AS PART OF THE CONVERSATION AROUND PLANNING AND BUILDING- AS WAS ALLUDED TO EARLIER IT IS AN UNSUSTAINABLE MODEL FOR OUR WORK FORCED TO SPEND TWO ORTHREE HOURS DRIVING I FROM WHERE THEY CAN AFFORD TO LIVE TO THE COMMUNITIES ARE WE CAN AFFORD TO BUILD WELL AS WERE BUILT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WAYS I HAVE AND POLICIES THAT ENCOURAGE A BUILDING- OF FACILITIES ARE PEOPLE CAN WORK ALONG SIDE OF WHERE THEY LIVE. OUT ONE FINAL POINT AS THE KURDS INTENDING TO DO- WE HOPE THAT YOU CONSIDER THE MANY MODELS THAT THERE MAY BE FOR THE FUTURE OF WORKFORCE TRAINING. AYE MANUFACTURERS- PARTICIPATE IN THE STATE'S APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS WE HAVE SEVERAL- WORKING- MODELS ONE IN PARTICULAR DOWN- IN THE INLAND EMPIRE THE INTAKE CENTER- THAT EMERGE FROM MY PARTNERSHIP WITH CALIFORNIA'S STEEL INDUSTRIES- BUT WE FIND THAT MANY OF OUR PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES WITH WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD. REMEMBER WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS OFTEN ONE OFFICE- WE DON'T FIND A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR- BUILDING AND SCALING UP OF THE TESLA MODEL THAT WE'VE EVELOPED SO. I AM FOUND THAT CERTAIN STATE PROGRAMS- WILL SUCCESSFUL FOR SOME INDUSTRIES DON'T ONLINE WITH THE NEEDS OF OUR INDUSTRY SO AS THIS CONVERSATION CONTINUES WE HOPE THAT YOU ARE. CONSIDER THE MANY SUCCESSFUL MODELS THAT ARE OUT THERE AND USE THAT TO GUIDE SOME OF THE YOU GET FOR HAVING. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR COMMENTS HERE TODAY. AND ANY SUGGESTIONS IN TERMS OF HOW WE- MAY I AM SENSITIVE TO THE ONE OFF FRANKLY I WAS GONNA SAY. JUST BRING ALL OF THOSE JOBS. CENTER CAP. OKAY DELIVERY. WITH IT EARNING THE THOUSAND DOLLARS BUT- BUT BUT BUT BUT AND I'M IN ALL SERIOUSNESS THE OFF. WORRIES ME BECAUSE THAT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE AND SO THE QUESTION BECOMES HOW DO WE INSTITUTIONALIZE AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE WERE GETTING TO. WITH THE SECOND COMMITTEE IS. WHAT WHAT ARE THE BARRIERS THERE THAT WE HAVE IN STATE LINE AND HOW CAN WE INCENTIVIZE. THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY TO COME FORWARD AND HELP US TO CREATE THE MODEL THAT ACTUALLY WORKS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOR YOUR TESTIMONY IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WOULD LIKE AN OPPORTUNITY IS A FEW WORDS. SAYING NO ONE ELSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US HERE TODAY THIS CONCLUDES OUR HEARING
