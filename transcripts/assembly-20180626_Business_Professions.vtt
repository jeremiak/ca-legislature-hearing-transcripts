HOWEVER BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL

00:42:15.432 --> 00:42:17.268

01:05:04.767 --> 01:05:05.901
COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS

01:05:05.968 --> 01:05:07.770
AT THIS TIME.

01:05:07.837 --> 01:05:09.038
SEE NO QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS

01:05:09.105 --> 01:05:10.506
FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS

01:05:10.573 --> 01:05:12.174
TIME SENATOR PANDEY WAS TO CLOSE.

01:05:12.241 --> 01:05:13.476
THE THANK YOU I I WOULD JUST

01:05:13.542 --> 01:05:15.645
MAKE NOTE THAT --

01:05:15.711 --> 01:05:16.746
UNDER JUST BILL --

01:05:16.812 --> 01:05:19.248
PRODUCTS WILL BE TESTED AND THEN

01:05:19.315 --> 01:05:20.816
THEY WILL HAVE TO BE PACED IN A

01:05:20.883 --> 01:05:22.218
TAMPER PROOF PACKAGE AS

01:05:22.285 --> 01:05:23.786
ESTABLISHED BY LAW.

01:05:23.853 --> 01:05:25.955
SO AT THAT POINT IN TIME --

01:05:26.022 --> 01:05:27.957
BASICALLY THE PRODUCT IS IT

01:05:28.024 --> 01:05:29.992
YOUNG HAS BEEN TESTED IT'S BEING

01:05:30.059 --> 01:05:31.894
PLACED IN A IN AN AND A PRODUCT

01:05:31.961 --> 01:05:33.763
THAT WILL ENSURE THAT WILL BE

01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:34.930
NOTED THAT IF THERE IS ANY

IF THERE IS --

01:05:39.435 --> 01:05:42.171

01:05:49.045 --> 01:05:50.946
OFTEN BETWEEN SO I THINK THAT

01:05:51.013 --> 01:05:52.848
THIS BILL CERTAINLY ASSURES THAT

01:05:52.915 --> 01:05:54.450

CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN PLACE --

01:05:58.220 --> 01:05:59.522
AND THIS WILL SIMPLY HELP

01:05:59.588 --> 01:06:00.890
FACILITATE --

01:06:00.956 --> 01:06:03.759

OF THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE TO MAKE

01:06:59.482 --> 01:07:01.751
A TERRIBLE CHOICE OF EITHER

01:07:01.817 --> 01:07:03.719

01:07:03.786 --> 01:07:05.254

TO RETURN TO WORK THE BILL'S.

01:07:11.794 --> 01:07:12.261
REALLY FUNDAMENTALLY ABOUT

01:07:12.328 --> 01:07:13.662
ALLOWING A NEW MOTHERS TO THE

01:07:13.729 --> 01:07:15.731

01:07:15.798 --> 01:07:17.366
WHEN THEY RETURN TO WORK --

01:07:17.433 --> 01:07:19.068
I'M NOT MAKING THAT DECISION FOR

01:07:19.135 --> 01:07:21.103
THEM WE WANT --

01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:22.538
MOTHERS TO BE ABLE TO BREAST

01:07:22.605 --> 01:07:24.273
THEIR CHILDREN AND WE WANT THEM

01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:26.108
TO BE ABLE TO WORK AND THE TWO

01:07:26.175 --> 01:07:28.010
ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.

01:07:28.077 --> 01:07:30.479
OUR CURRENT LAW AYE IS VERY --

01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:32.915
BAREBONES IT REQUIRES THAT AN

01:07:32.982 --> 01:07:34.116

SITTING ON A TOILET.

01:07:41.056 --> 01:07:42.992
AND THAT'S GREAT NOT TO FORCE

01:07:43.058 --> 01:07:44.059
PEOPLE TO EXPRESS MARK WAS

01:07:44.126 --> 01:07:45.161
SITTING ON A TOILET BUT IT'S NOT

01:07:45.227 --> 01:07:46.395
ENOUGH.

01:07:46.462 --> 01:07:48.130
SO THE BILL WILL PUT BASIC

01:15:36.331 --> 01:15:37.966
SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH THE

01:15:38.033 --> 01:15:39.401
CURRENT VERSION OF THE BILL.

01:15:39.468 --> 01:15:41.069
THE BILL WAYS AND TO BE

01:15:41.136 --> 01:15:42.004
STRUCTURED AFTER THE SAN

01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:43.705
FRANCISCO ORDINANCE HOWEVER

01:15:43.772 --> 01:15:45.507
THERE ARE TWO LARGE PROVISIONS A

01:15:45.574 --> 01:15:46.508
IN THE BILL PART OF IT'S A

01:15:46.575 --> 01:15:48.143
BUILDING CODE REQUIREMENTS OF MY

01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:48.710
COLLEAGUE AT THE ARCHIVAL

01:15:48.777 --> 01:15:49.511
DISCUSSED.

01:15:49.578 --> 01:15:50.879
BUT THE OTHER ISSUE IS THE

01:15:50.946 --> 01:15:51.880
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION

01:15:51.947 --> 01:15:52.981
CURRENTLY THE SAN FRANCISCO

01:15:53.048 --> 01:15:54.049
ORDINANCE DOES NOT HAVE A

01:15:54.116 --> 01:15:55.050
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION NEED

01:15:55.117 --> 01:15:56.385
FORSMAN MEASURES THROUGH THE

01:15:56.451 --> 01:15:57.085
LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

01:15:57.152 --> 01:15:58.587
THIS WOULD ALLOW AN EMPLOYEE TO

01:15:58.654 --> 01:16:01.757
BRING A EVEN IF THEY'RE PROVIDE

01:16:01.823 --> 01:16:03.792
THE ACTUAL ELECTED ACCOMMODATION

01:16:03.859 --> 01:16:04.626
THEY COULD STILL BRING THE RIGHT

01:16:04.693 --> 01:16:06.295
OF ACTION FOR THE SMALLER

01:16:06.361 --> 01:16:08.030
NUANCES OF THE BILL SUCH AS

01:16:08.096 --> 01:16:08.931
NOTICE REQUIREMENTS

01:16:08.997 --> 01:16:10.299
DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS AND

01:16:10.365 --> 01:16:11.466
THINGS LIKE THAT.

01:16:11.533 --> 01:16:12.467
AND SO THAT'S A HUGE CHANGE IN

01:16:12.534 --> 01:16:13.769
THE LAW FOR US --

01:16:13.835 --> 01:16:14.903
ADDITIONALLY THIS IS MUCH MORE

01:16:14.970 --> 01:16:16.338

PROPERTIES ASSOCIATION WE HAVE

01:16:54.009 --> 01:16:55.477
TRIED TO WORK WITH THE AUTHORS

01:16:55.544 --> 01:16:56.845
OF THE BILL HAS BEEN AMENDED TO

01:16:56.912 --> 01:16:57.346
GET TO THE SAN FRANCISCO

01:16:57.412 --> 01:16:58.480

01:16:58.547 --> 01:17:00.082
WHICH WAS JUST PASSED LAST YEAR

01:17:00.148 --> 01:17:00.749
AND HAS JUST STARTED TO BE

01:17:00.816 --> 01:17:01.883
IMPLEMENTED.

01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:03.719
THE ISSUE FOR OUR MEMBERS IS

01:17:03.785 --> 01:17:05.387

01:17:05.454 --> 01:17:06.888
PHYSICAL BUILDING OF ROOM

SPECIFIED FOR A CERTAIN ACTIVITY

01:17:09.858 --> 01:17:11.293
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE REALLY IN

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:12.928
THE BUILDING CODE THAT IS

01:17:12.995 --> 01:17:14.496
SIMILAR TO THIS.

01:17:14.563 --> 01:17:15.964
SO FOR A LOT OF YOUR BILL DOUBTS

01:17:16.031 --> 01:17:17.332

01:17:21.069 --> 01:17:22.637
ON SOME OF THESE BILL DOUBTS

01:17:22.704 --> 01:17:23.572
YOU'RE LOOKING AT ANYWHERE FROM

APPORTIONED ROOM.

01:17:31.013 --> 01:17:33.582

THEY'RE GONNA BE FINE WITH THAT

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:46.628
BUT THAT COSTS.

01:17:46.695 --> 01:17:48.830
WILL ALL GET PASSED ALONG TO THE

01:17:48.897 --> 01:17:50.866
SMALL BUSINESSES.

APPROACH THAT IS MUCH SO MORE

01:17:55.003 --> 01:17:56.571
SIMILAR TO CURRENT LAW AND WE'RE

01:17:56.638 --> 01:17:57.973
WORKING ON IN THIS BUILDING TO

01:17:58.040 --> 01:17:59.908
MAKE THAT HAPPEN WHERE EMPLOYERS

01:17:59.975 --> 01:18:00.976

01:20:34.062 --> 01:20:36.531
APPLIES TO A LOT OF A NUMBER OF

01:20:36.598 --> 01:20:37.732
VERSIONS OF THE LABOR CODE IT'S

01:20:37.799 --> 01:20:38.967
NOT WE'RE NOT CREATING A NEW

01:20:39.034 --> 01:20:39.801
THING HERE.

01:20:39.868 --> 01:20:41.203
BUT YOU KNOW I THINK IT IS

01:20:41.269 --> 01:20:42.571
IMPORTANT --

01:20:42.637 --> 01:20:43.672
TO HOW THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF

01:20:43.738 --> 01:20:46.007

OPTION OF COMPLETE FIRE

01:20:50.145 --> 01:20:50.579

THERE'S A TIME HORIZON ON IT IT

01:21:03.458 --> 01:21:04.693
TAKES A FEW YEARS TO RESOLVE SO

01:21:04.759 --> 01:21:05.293
BE IT.

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:07.062

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.402
IF WE DON'T HAVE EFFECTIVE AND

MORE EXPEDITIOUS ENFORCEMENT

01:21:16.938 --> 01:21:18.273
TOOLS LIGHT.

01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:19.874
EVEN THE THREAT OF A LAWSUIT IN

01:21:19.941 --> 01:21:21.243
TERMS OF GETTING EMPLOYERS TO

01:21:21.309 --> 01:21:22.677
COMPLY -- I

01:21:22.744 --> 01:21:24.279
THINK THIS WILL BECOME VERY VERY

01:21:24.346 --> 01:21:25.981
HARD TO ENFORCE NOT IMPOSSIBLE

01:21:26.047 --> 01:21:27.949
VERY HARD --

01:21:28.016 --> 01:21:30.485
AND SO THAT THAT'S WHY WE CHOSE.

01:21:30.552 --> 01:21:31.920
OUGHT TO PUT IN THERE THIS IS A

01:21:31.987 --> 01:21:32.821
TIME SENSITIVE THING IN THE

01:21:36.024 --> 01:21:37.559
ENFORCEMENT.

01:21:37.626 --> 01:21:39.060

AND CERTAINLY AGAIN YOU'RE

01:21:40.328 --> 01:21:41.162
YOU'RE CORRECT BUT THE TIME

01:21:41.229 --> 01:21:42.197
HORIZON THERE'S NOTHING THAT

01:21:42.264 --> 01:21:44.099
WOULD KEEP US FROM SAYING THAT

01:21:44.165 --> 01:21:45.433
THIS HAS TO BE EXPEDITED IN

01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:47.135

FOR THAT.

01:36:30.351 --> 01:36:32.119
BOMB.

01:36:32.186 --> 01:36:33.387

BECAUSE THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS

LIVE EXPRESSES TOO EXPENSIVE.

01:36:46.433 --> 01:36:48.702

01:36:58.679 --> 01:37:00.114
THE OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL HAS

01:37:00.181 --> 01:37:01.615
CITED THE FACT THAT NEXT YEAR

LAW IT VERY RARELY IS RESCINDED

01:37:13.994 --> 01:37:15.596
SO THERE'S NO REASON.

01:37:15.663 --> 01:37:18.032
THAT THIS COMPLETELY SAFE PRO

01:37:18.098 --> 01:37:19.400

01:37:30.010 --> 01:37:31.512
AN UNLICENSED BEHAVIOR.

01:37:31.579 --> 01:37:33.781

THEY'RE DOING A MULTITUDE OF

01:37:37.918 --> 01:37:39.320
MANY OTHER THINGS [inaudible]

01:37:39.386 --> 01:37:42.723
HOWEVER --

01:37:42.790 --> 01:37:44.325

OVERSIGHTS IN THIS AREA.

01:38:06.513 --> 01:38:07.982
BUT ONE THING I JUST WANT TO

01:38:08.048 --> 01:38:10.117
MAKE CLEAR BY NO MEANS --

01:38:10.184 --> 01:38:11.652

01:38:20.761 --> 01:38:22.997
I CERTAINLY WOULD NOT MAKE IT

ADVISABLE TO HAVE MY STAFF

01:38:25.232 --> 01:38:26.900

01:38:36.610 --> 01:38:39.446
THERE ASK IN THE SHAMPOO WORST.

01:38:39.513 --> 01:38:41.315
TO HAVE THIS EDUCATION.

01:38:41.382 --> 01:38:43.917
BUT THE LICENSE BEAUTICIANS AND

01:38:43.984 --> 01:38:45.319
BARBERS ALREADY HAVE THIS

01:38:45.386 --> 01:38:46.787
LICENSE SO IF THEY WANT.

01:38:46.854 --> 01:38:48.922

THE WAY ON ON THIS THING ON

01:38:50.858 --> 01:38:52.426
SHAMPOOING.

01:38:52.493 --> 01:38:53.460
VERSES.

01:38:53.527 --> 01:38:54.728
BARBERINI.

01:38:54.795 --> 01:38:58.932
WE MY STAFF TOOK --

01:38:58.999 --> 01:39:00.334
FORTY HAIR SALONS IN EVERYBODY'S

01:39:00.401 --> 01:39:02.970
DISTRICT AND IT WAS RARE TO FIND

01:39:03.037 --> 01:39:05.506
ANY COMPLAINTS ON YELP.

01:39:05.572 --> 01:39:06.740
THAT PEOPLE HAVE ON SHAMPOOING

01:39:06.807 --> 01:39:08.942
BUT WE FOUND A LOT.

01:39:09.009 --> 01:39:10.944
ON PEOPLE WHO CUT HAIR AND YOU

01:39:11.011 --> 01:39:12.279
KNOW THE PETITIONS --

01:39:12.346 --> 01:39:13.347
AND THOSE WERE LICENSE PEOPLE

01:39:13.414 --> 01:39:14.982
BUT SO FAR SHAMPOOING THEY WERE

01:39:15.049 --> 01:39:16.350
VERY CLEAN --

01:39:16.417 --> 01:39:17.785

COMPLAINTS AND WILL NOT OLLIER

01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:21.622

IT WAS WITH PEOPLE WHO HAD

01:39:22.723 --> 01:39:24.825
LICENSE SO AGAIN I THINK IT'S

01:39:24.892 --> 01:39:27.695
UNFAIR. TO TALK ABOUT --

01:39:27.761 --> 01:39:29.330
THAT THERE'S GREAT PROBLEMS HERE

01:39:29.396 --> 01:39:30.531

HE ARE NOT THANK --

01:39:34.702 --> 01:39:35.235

01:39:35.302 --> 01:39:36.937
SHAMPOO IS TO SERVE AS A ROLL OF

01:39:37.004 --> 01:39:39.340

BUSINESS. FOR THEMSELVES AND

01:39:49.817 --> 01:39:51.051
MOVING THEM UP THE LADDER SO

02:08:39.078 --> 02:08:41.413
WE ARE ALLOW INNOVATION IN A

02:08:41.480 --> 02:08:42.481
WORLD WHERE WE DON'T AND WE'RE

02:08:42.548 --> 02:08:44.516
WHEN WE'RE ALLOWING INNOVATION

02:08:44.583 --> 02:08:45.184
THAT MEANS PEOPLE CAN GET

02:08:45.250 --> 02:08:46.251
SERVICES THEY WANT --

02:08:46.318 --> 02:08:48.487
IN IN WAYS THAT ARE EASIER FOR

02:08:48.554 --> 02:08:50.055
THEM AND WAYS THAT COST THEM

02:08:50.122 --> 02:08:52.257
LESS MONEY SO TO THE EXTENT THAT

02:08:52.324 --> 02:08:53.792
WE CAN MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION

02:08:53.859 --> 02:08:55.727
AND STILL PROTECT CONSUMER

02:08:55.794 --> 02:08:56.261
SAFETY I THINK WE HAVE AN

02:08:56.328 --> 02:08:58.564
OBLIGATION. TO CALIFORNIANS TO

02:08:58.630 --> 02:08:59.965
DO THAT AND I THINK THAT YOUR

02:09:00.032 --> 02:09:01.400
BILL MOVES US IN THAT DIRECTION

02:09:01.467 --> 02:09:03.035
I'LL CERTAINLY BE SUPPORTING IT

02:09:03.102 --> 02:09:03.402
TODAY.

02:09:03.469 --> 02:09:05.471
BUT I WANT TO ENCOURAGE EVERYONE

02:09:05.537 --> 02:09:06.472
THAT SHOULD THE BILL NOT MOVE

02:09:06.538 --> 02:09:07.906
FORWARD TO THAT THIS NOT BE THE

02:09:07.973 --> 02:09:09.241
END OF THE DISCUSSION BECAUSE I

02:09:09.308 --> 02:09:10.309

A PERSONAL SERVICES PERMIT THAT

02:09:13.378 --> 02:09:15.781

SERVICES OUTSIDE OF THE SETTING

02:09:17.316 --> 02:09:18.250

02:09:20.119 --> 02:09:21.420
