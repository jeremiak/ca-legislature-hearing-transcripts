TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE HEALTH

01:17:06.788 --> 01:17:08.890
PROTECTIVE. OXIDES OF NITROGEN

01:17:08.957 --> 01:17:11.059
NITROGEN CALLED KNOX ARE ONE OF

01:17:11.126 --> 01:17:13.328
THE KEY SMOG FORMING POLLUTANTS

WE CONTROL TO PREVENT OZONE

01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:17.032
FORMATION. KNOX EMISSIONS HAVE

01:17:17.099 --> 01:17:18.600
BEEN STEADILY DECREASING SINCE

01:17:18.667 --> 01:17:20.168

BELOW NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS BY

01:25:15.009 --> 01:25:17.946
TWENTY FIFTY. IF WE ACHIEVE THE

01:25:18.012 --> 01:25:18.446
TWENTY THIRTY TARGET AND

01:25:18.513 --> 01:25:20.348
MAINTAIN THAT RATE REDUCTIONS WE

01:25:20.415 --> 01:25:22.183
WOULD BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE 80%

01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:24.552
BELOW NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS BY

01:25:24.619 --> 01:25:27.522
TWENTY FORTY. TWENTY THIRTY IS

01:25:27.589 --> 01:25:29.491
AN EMISSIONS TARGET BUT IT IS

01:25:29.557 --> 01:25:32.293
ALSO A MILESTONE ON THE WAY TO

01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:33.895
ACHIEVING CARBON NEUTRALITY. THE

01:25:33.962 --> 01:25:35.930

01:25:35.997 --> 01:25:37.565
TO HIT CARBON NEUTRALITY BY MID

01:25:37.632 --> 01:25:39.567
CENTURY MEANS THAT WE SHOULD

01:25:39.634 --> 01:25:41.169
PRIORITIZE ACTIONS IN

01:25:41.236 --> 01:25:42.403
TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL NOT

01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:44.439
RESULT IN STRANDED ACCESS AFTER

01:25:44.506 --> 01:25:45.773
TWENTY THIRTY. AND WE'RE A

01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:48.142
LONGER POLICY SIGNAL IS CRITICAL

01:25:48.209 --> 01:25:49.944
TO ATTRACT PRIVATE CAPITAL FOR

01:25:50.011 --> 01:25:52.080
ACTION AND INVESTMENT IN CLEAN

01:25:52.146 --> 01:25:55.617

01:25:55.683 --> 01:25:57.852
OUR ACTIONABLE PLANS TO LAY OUT

01:25:57.919 --> 01:25:59.554
A COST EFFECTIVE IN TECHNOLOGY

01:25:59.621 --> 01:26:01.523
FEASIBLE PATH TO ENSURE THAT WE

01:26:01.589 --> 01:26:03.625
MEET THE STATEWIDE GHG REDUCTION

01:26:03.691 --> 01:26:06.628
TARGETS. IT SCOPING PLAN HAS

01:26:06.694 --> 01:26:08.296
INCLUDED SWEET OF POLICIES TO

01:26:08.363 --> 01:26:10.498
ACHIEVE BROAD MANDATES AND HAS

01:26:10.565 --> 01:26:12.200
NEVER RELIED ON ONE APPROACH TO

01:26:12.267 --> 01:26:14.068
ACHIEVING EMISSIONS THEY EACH

01:26:14.135 --> 01:26:16.704
HAVE A COMBINATION OF INCENTIVES

01:26:16.771 --> 01:26:19.007
REGULATIONS AND CARBON PRICING.

01:26:19.073 --> 01:26:20.875
THE PLAN IS ECONOMY WIDE AND

01:26:20.942 --> 01:26:23.444
SPANS MANY YEARS AS SUCH IT DOES

01:26:23.511 --> 01:26:25.280
NOT GO INTO THE DESIGN DETAILS

01:26:25.346 --> 01:26:27.949
OF ANY PROGRAM OR REGULATION.

01:26:28.016 --> 01:26:30.785
NOR DOES IT SUPPLANT OR CREATE

01:26:30.852 --> 01:26:32.820
NEW STATUTES AND REGULATIONS.

01:26:32.887 --> 01:26:34.656
THIS IS OUR FOURTH SCOPING PLAN

01:26:34.722 --> 01:26:37.158
UPDATE AT A MINIMUM EACH PLAN

01:26:37.225 --> 01:26:38.426
LEVERAGES TRADITIONAL AIR

01:26:38.493 --> 01:26:40.962
QUALITY POLICIES TO PROVIDE BOTH

01:26:41.029 --> 01:26:42.463
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND AIR

01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:44.566
POLLUTION EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS.

01:26:44.632 --> 01:26:46.701
AND WE ARE REQUIRED TO MINIMIZE

01:26:46.768 --> 01:26:48.536
FOR LEAKAGE WHICH IS WHEN THE

01:26:48.603 --> 01:26:50.271
PRODUCTION OF GOODS AND JOBS

01:26:50.338 --> 01:26:52.407
LEAVES THE STATE. SO IT LOOKS

01:26:52.473 --> 01:26:53.708
LIKE WE REDUCE EMISSIONS BUT

01:26:53.775 --> 01:26:56.077
THEY WERE MERELY MOVED OUT OF

01:26:56.144 --> 01:26:58.680
OUR INVENTORY. FINALLY AB THIRTY

01:26:58.746 --> 01:27:00.281
TWO REQUIRES US TO FACILITATE

01:27:00.348 --> 01:27:01.649
SUBNATIONAL AND NATIONAL

01:27:01.716 --> 01:27:03.685
COLLABORATION AND THAT POLICIES

01:27:03.751 --> 01:27:05.620
BE COST EFFECTIVE AND FLEXIBLE

01:27:05.687 --> 01:27:07.755
WITH COMPLIANCE. THIS IS

01:27:07.822 --> 01:27:09.557
CRITICAL AS CALIFORNIA

01:27:09.624 --> 01:27:12.627
REPRESENTS 1% OF GLOBAL GHG

01:27:12.694 --> 01:27:15.430
EMISSIONS. WE CANNOT SOLVE THIS

01:27:15.496 --> 01:27:18.266
GLOBAL ISSUE WITHOUT ACTION FROM

01:27:18.333 --> 01:27:21.069
LIKE MINDED PARTNERS WE CANNOT

01:27:21.135 --> 01:27:23.171
DO THIS ALONE. FOR GLOBAL

01:27:23.237 --> 01:27:24.539
POLLUTANTS SUCH AS GREENHOUSE

01:27:24.606 --> 01:27:26.908
GASES A REDUCTION ANYWHERE IS A

01:27:26.975 --> 01:27:29.310
BENEFIT EVERYWHERE WHICH THUS

01:27:29.377 --> 01:27:31.012
PROVIDES A DIRECT ENVIRONMENTAL

01:27:31.079 --> 01:27:33.047
BENEFIT TO THE STATE. OUR GOAL

01:27:33.114 --> 01:27:34.616
HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO DEVELOP

01:27:34.682 --> 01:27:37.285
SCALABLE AND EXPORTABLE PROGRAMS

01:27:37.352 --> 01:27:38.786
THAT OTHER JURISDICTIONS CAN

01:27:38.853 --> 01:27:40.755
IMPLEMENT AND USE TO REDUCE

01:27:40.822 --> 01:27:42.757
EMISSIONS WITH IN OUR WITHIN

01:27:42.824 --> 01:27:45.827
THEIR BORDERS. THIS IS ONE OF

01:27:45.893 --> 01:27:46.260
CALIFORNIA'S BIGGEST

01:27:46.327 --> 01:27:48.229
CONTRIBUTIONS TO ADDRESSING THIS

01:27:48.296 --> 01:27:51.733
GLOBAL THREAT. AS MENTIONED

01:27:51.799 --> 01:27:53.601
DIRECTION ON SCOPING PLAN GOALS

01:27:53.668 --> 01:27:55.136

01:27:58.973 --> 01:28:00.842
ADOPTED CARBON OTHER STATE

01:28:00.908 --> 01:28:02.644
AGENCIES START THE PROCESS OF

01:28:02.710 --> 01:28:04.145
REVIEWING AND UPDATING REGULAR

01:28:04.212 --> 01:28:06.347

ROLES AND AUTHORITY. FOR CARD

01:28:21.963 --> 01:28:23.498
THAT MEANS WE BRING FORTH DOZENS

01:28:23.564 --> 01:28:25.066
OF REGULATIONS AND PROGRAMS TO

01:28:25.133 --> 01:28:27.068
THE BOARD TO APPROVE WHICH WILL

01:28:27.135 --> 01:28:29.404
HELP IMPLEMENT THE PLAN. EACH OF

01:28:29.470 --> 01:28:30.872
THESE WILL HAVE THEIR OWN PUBLIC

01:28:30.938 --> 01:28:32.473
PROCESS AND DETAILED TECHNICAL

01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:34.575
ANALYSIS AND THAT MEANS THAT

01:28:34.642 --> 01:28:36.444
SOME REGULATIONS CAN TAKE A FEW

01:28:36.511 --> 01:28:38.279
YEARS TO DEVELOP THROUGH A

01:28:38.346 --> 01:28:40.081

ACHIEVE THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGET

01:29:42.310 --> 01:29:43.811
. THE HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE OF

01:29:43.878 --> 01:29:46.047
THESE PROGRAMS DOES NOT REFLECT

01:29:46.114 --> 01:29:47.482
THE IMPACT THESE PROGRAMS WILL

01:29:47.548 --> 01:29:48.649
HAVE UNDER THE INCREASED

01:29:48.716 --> 01:29:50.017
STRINGENCY ESTABLISHED FOR THIS

01:29:50.084 --> 01:29:54.155
DECADE. VARIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS

DILIGENTLY TO SEND STEADY AND

01:29:58.659 --> 01:30:00.561
UNWAVERING POLICY SIGNALS THAT

01:30:00.628 --> 01:30:02.730
WE WANT TO REDUCE GHGS AND

01:30:02.797 --> 01:30:04.532
ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE. WE ARE

01:30:04.599 --> 01:30:07.301
IN THE SECOND DECADE OF TACKLING

01:30:07.368 --> 01:30:09.771
CLIMATE CHANGE AND WE ARE SEEING

01:30:09.837 --> 01:30:10.938
THE OUTCOMES THAT WE HAD HOPED

01:30:11.005 --> 01:30:13.608
FOR. WE KNOW CLIMATE ACTION CAN

01:30:13.674 --> 01:30:16.511
CREATE AND KEEP HIGH ROAD JOBS

01:30:16.577 --> 01:30:18.312
AS SUCH AS IN OUR CLEAN TECH

01:30:18.379 --> 01:30:20.481
SECTORS. WE'VE SEEN SIGNIFICANT

01:30:20.548 --> 01:30:22.016
INVESTMENT AND INCREASED

01:30:22.083 --> 01:30:24.085
INVESTOR INTEREST IN CLEAN

AND INSTEAD PRODUCE RENEWABLE

01:30:33.094 --> 01:30:35.062
DIESEL. BROUGH DURABLE DIESEL

01:30:35.129 --> 01:30:38.399
PRODUCES 30% LESS DIESEL PM

01:30:38.466 --> 01:30:39.400
WHICH IS A CANCER CAUSING

01:30:39.467 --> 01:30:40.601
POLLUTANTS THAT CONCENTRATES

01:30:40.668 --> 01:30:42.737

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. ACHIEVING

01:31:24.145 --> 01:31:25.813
SUCCESS ON CLIMATE CHANGE MEANS

01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:28.115
WE MUST MOVE EXPEDITIOUSLY TO

01:31:28.182 --> 01:31:30.284
THE GREEN TRANSITION OF EXISTING

01:31:30.351 --> 01:31:32.420

SIZE OF THE REGIONAL GREENHOUSE

01:46:55.942 --> 01:46:57.077
GAS INITIATIVE. AND SO I THINK

01:46:57.144 --> 01:46:58.545
THAT IS A POINT DEPARTURE

01:46:58.612 --> 01:47:01.348
BECAUSE I'M HERE AS AN ADVOCATE

01:47:01.414 --> 01:47:03.150
BUT ALSO A CRITICAL ANALYST

01:47:03.216 --> 01:47:05.018
ABOUT THE ROLE OF CARBON MARKETS

01:47:05.085 --> 01:47:06.086

01:47:19.266 --> 01:47:21.434
IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND AND TRY

01:47:21.501 --> 01:47:22.836
TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS IN

01:47:22.903 --> 01:47:24.938
ORDER FOR US TO MAKE PROGRESS.

01:47:25.005 --> 01:47:26.139
AT THE SAME TIME I LIKE TO KEEP

01:47:26.206 --> 01:47:29.543
IN MIND THAT. OF PUTTING A PRICE

01:47:29.609 --> 01:47:31.945
ON POLLUTION CONTRAST SHARPLY

01:47:32.012 --> 01:47:33.313
WITH THE CONVENTIONAL WAY THAT

01:47:33.380 --> 01:47:35.382
INDUSTRIAL LICENCES TO POLLUTE

01:47:35.448 --> 01:47:37.350
WERE ISSUED BY STATES FOUR

01:47:37.417 --> 01:47:38.285
HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE YEARS WHICH

01:47:38.351 --> 01:47:41.788
WAS TO GIVE THOSE AND LICENSE TO

01:47:41.855 --> 01:47:43.623
POLLUTE AWAY FOR FREE. I PUTTING

01:47:43.690 --> 01:47:45.158
A PRICE ON CARBON. LOOTERS HAVE

01:47:45.225 --> 01:47:46.726
TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S A COST

01:47:46.793 --> 01:47:48.328
TO THE POLLUTION AND DEBATE

01:47:48.395 --> 01:47:49.529
GOING TOWARD HER THERE'S AN

01:47:49.596 --> 01:47:51.264
INCENTIVE TO TRY TO AVOID THE

01:47:51.331 --> 01:47:52.699
POLLUTION EVEN WHEN ALLOWANCES

01:47:52.766 --> 01:47:53.834
ARE GIVEN AWAY FOR FREE TO

01:47:53.900 --> 01:47:55.202
INDUSTRY THERE REMAINS AN

01:47:55.268 --> 01:47:56.703
INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO TRY TO

01:47:56.770 --> 01:47:58.605
FIND A WAY TO REDUCE THE

01:47:58.672 --> 01:47:59.773
POLLUTION. NOW WE SHOULD REMAIN

01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:01.107
CONCERNED ABOUT HOW MUCH FREE

01:48:01.174 --> 01:48:04.144
ALLOCATION THIS CALL FOR AND I'M

01:48:04.211 --> 01:48:06.046
GONNA HAVE MORE TO SAY ABOUT

01:48:06.112 --> 01:48:06.613
THAT IN A MOMENT. THE THIRD

01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:08.014
COMPLIANCE PERIOD JUST FINISHED

01:48:08.081 --> 01:48:10.550
IN TWENTY TWENTY. WITH A 100%

01:48:10.617 --> 01:48:13.353
COMPLIANCE. THIS SUCCESS

01:48:13.420 --> 01:48:16.223
PROVIDES A SOLID PLATFORM. FOR

01:48:16.289 --> 01:48:19.092
REFORMS. THAT WERE BEGUN IN

01:48:19.159 --> 01:48:20.827
TWENTY TWENTY ONE. UP FOR THIS

01:48:20.894 --> 01:48:22.963
NEW COMPLAINTS BREED AND I THINK

01:48:23.029 --> 01:48:25.465
ALSO FURTHER. REFORMS THAT WERE

01:48:25.532 --> 01:48:27.167
GOING TO DISCUSS NOW THAT ARE

01:48:27.234 --> 01:48:29.236
RECOMMENDED BY I. MAK FOR THE-

01:48:29.302 --> 01:48:30.871
CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. I DON'T

01:48:30.937 --> 01:48:32.339
START BY FRAMING THIS IN THE

01:48:32.405 --> 01:48:34.307
CONTEXT OF THE SCOPING PLAN. I

01:48:34.374 --> 01:48:37.577
AM. THE ARBY'S BIGGEST FAN. BOTH

01:48:37.644 --> 01:48:39.246
INSIDE THE STADIUM WHEN I SPEAK

01:48:39.312 --> 01:48:40.380
TO FOLKS OUTSIDE THE STATE AS IT

01:48:40.447 --> 01:48:42.282
IS THE LEADING TECHNICAL AGENCY

01:48:42.349 --> 01:48:44.551
IN THE WORLD. ON AIR QUALITY AND

01:48:44.618 --> 01:48:46.253
CLIMATE CHANGE AND- AND OTHER

01:48:46.319 --> 01:48:47.287
GOVERNMENTS ALL OVER THE WORLD

01:48:47.354 --> 01:48:49.356
LOOK TO THE A. R. B. FOR ITS

01:48:49.422 --> 01:48:50.857
TECHNICAL GUIDANCE. AND I'M A

01:48:50.924 --> 01:48:54.194
BIG FAN OF THE SCOPING PLAN

01:48:54.261 --> 01:48:56.496
PROCESS WHICH IS. REALLY BEGINS

01:48:56.563 --> 01:48:57.130
BY IDENTIFYING THE TECHNOLOGICAL

01:48:57.197 --> 01:48:58.765
PATHWAYS THE SEED WAY DOWN THE

01:48:58.832 --> 01:49:01.201
ROAD ON WHERE WE- NEED TO GO. UP

01:49:01.268 --> 01:49:03.470
THE IMAX CONCERNS ARE

01:49:03.536 --> 01:49:05.305
INCREASINGLY TO MARRY THAT WITH

01:49:05.372 --> 01:49:07.807
A PERFORMANCE ACCORDING TO THE

01:49:07.874 --> 01:49:08.508
MILESTONES THAT CHARITABLE.

01:49:08.575 --> 01:49:12.112
ENGINE AND THE COMMITTEE ASKED

01:49:12.178 --> 01:49:13.980
FOR GREATER CLARITY ABOUT WHAT

01:49:14.047 --> 01:49:15.582
THE STATE WILL DO TO HIT THE

01:49:15.649 --> 01:49:16.983
TWENTY THIRTY GOAL AND WE WOULD

01:49:17.050 --> 01:49:18.151
DESCRIBE THIS IS ALMOST AN

01:49:18.218 --> 01:49:19.886
ADDITIONAL SCENARIO TO THE ONES

01:49:19.953 --> 01:49:25.358
ARE BEING MODELED. FOR SOME

01:49:25.425 --> 01:49:26.626
TYPES OF ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS

01:49:26.693 --> 01:49:28.595
ARE MEASURES TAKE EFFECT WHERE

01:49:28.662 --> 01:49:30.330
ARE WE WHAT IS THE PROJECT ALL

01:49:30.397 --> 01:49:32.198
RIGHT NOW. IN THE COMMITTEE US

01:49:32.265 --> 01:49:33.500
FOR GREATER CLARITY ABOUT THE

01:49:33.566 --> 01:49:35.502
ROLE OF COPPER TRADING CHORE AND

01:49:35.568 --> 01:49:37.337
ALSO THAT WE CAN EXPECT TO LEARN

01:49:37.404 --> 01:49:40.140
MORE ABOUT THAT. IN THE FUTURE.

01:49:40.206 --> 01:49:41.341
ONE OF THE BIG CONCERNS ABOUT

01:49:41.408 --> 01:49:43.143
THE CARPENTRY PROGRAM IS THE

01:49:43.209 --> 01:49:45.879
ROLE OF THE ALLOWANCE BANK. THE

01:49:45.946 --> 01:49:48.815
THERE ARE BEES ARE ASSESSMENT AT

01:49:48.882 --> 01:49:49.849
THE ENDOF THE THIRD COMPLIANCE

01:49:49.916 --> 01:49:51.384
PERIOD VALIDATED THE

01:49:51.451 --> 01:49:53.653
CALCULATIONS BY THE I'M OUT. THE

01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:55.555
DOOR OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLION.

01:49:55.622 --> 01:49:57.290
ALLOWANCES SUPPORT EQUABLE THE

01:49:57.357 --> 01:49:59.459
TONS. RESIDING AT PRIVATE

01:49:59.526 --> 01:50:00.927
ACCOUNTS EVEN AFTER AFTER

01:50:00.994 --> 01:50:03.663
ACCOUNTING FOR THE- ON TERRY

01:50:03.730 --> 01:50:05.699
ALLOWANCES. AND FURTHERMORE

01:50:05.765 --> 01:50:07.067
THERE ARE NEARLY AS MANY

01:50:07.133 --> 01:50:08.568
ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCES AND PUBLIC

01:50:08.635 --> 01:50:10.904
ACCOUNTS THE COULD REENTER THE

01:50:10.971 --> 01:50:11.504
PROGRAM UNDER CERTAIN CERTAIN

01:50:11.571 --> 01:50:14.207
CIRCUMSTANCES. THE PRIVATELY

01:50:14.274 --> 01:50:16.209
BANKS ALLOWANCES ALONE OR

01:50:16.276 --> 01:50:18.979
GREATER THAN ONE YEAR ANNUAL

01:50:19.045 --> 01:50:20.680
ISSUANCE OF NEW ALLOWANCES UNDER

01:50:20.747 --> 01:50:22.182
THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM THIS

01:50:22.248 --> 01:50:24.517
IS A VERY SIZABLE BANK. AND IT'S

01:50:24.584 --> 01:50:25.785
GREATER THAN THE PROJECTIVE

01:50:25.852 --> 01:50:28.288
CUMULATIVE EMISSION REDUCTIONS

01:50:28.355 --> 01:50:29.222
BY SOURCES COVERED BY THE CAP

01:50:29.289 --> 01:50:32.225
AND TRADE PROGRAM UNDER THAT

01:50:32.292 --> 01:50:33.460
UNDER THE CAP THREE TWENTY

01:50:33.526 --> 01:50:35.328
THIRTY. IF THERE'S THOSE

01:50:35.395 --> 01:50:36.363
REDUCTIONS ARE CORRECT 4% PER

01:50:36.429 --> 01:50:39.299
YEAR. SO THE RESOLUTION OF THE

01:50:39.366 --> 01:50:41.501
ALLOW ITS SUPPLY INCLUDING THE

01:50:41.568 --> 01:50:43.036
BANK WILL DETERMINE THE EMISSION

01:50:43.103 --> 01:50:45.071
REDUCTIONS THAT ARE ACHIEVED BY

01:50:45.138 --> 01:50:47.507
COVEREDSOURCES. THE MARKET

01:50:47.574 --> 01:50:50.910
COVERS ONLY 75% OF TOTAL

01:50:50.977 --> 01:50:51.544
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN THE

01:50:51.611 --> 01:50:53.947
STATE. AND IF EMISSION

01:50:54.014 --> 01:50:55.715
REDUCTIONS AT THESE SOURCES

01:50:55.782 --> 01:50:57.550
COVERED BY THE CAP DON'T KEEP UP

01:50:57.617 --> 01:50:59.519
IT'S MEANS THAT WE WILL NOT THIS

01:50:59.586 --> 01:51:01.187
NECESSITATED GREATER LEVEL OF

01:51:01.254 --> 01:51:02.255
MISTER REDUCTIONS THAT SOURCES

01:51:02.322 --> 01:51:04.290
OUTSIDE THE COPS INCLUDING

01:51:04.357 --> 01:51:06.192
NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS. END

01:51:06.259 --> 01:51:09.162
INEVITABLY GREATER REGULATIONS

01:51:09.229 --> 01:51:10.296
TO ACHIEVE THE TWENTY THIRTY

01:51:10.363 --> 01:51:13.533
GOALS. OF THE COMMITTEE ASKS A

01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:15.502
OR B. TO DEVELOP ANNUAL. VISIBLE

01:51:15.568 --> 01:51:17.537
ANNUAL METRICS ABOUT THE SIZE OF

01:51:17.604 --> 01:51:19.672
THE BANK SO THE LEGISLATURE AND

01:51:19.739 --> 01:51:21.674
THE PUBLIC CAN OBSERVE THE ROLE

01:51:21.741 --> 01:51:22.509
CAP AND TRADE AND TRY TO

01:51:22.575 --> 01:51:24.277
CONTRIBUTE CONSTRUCTIVELY TO

01:51:24.344 --> 01:51:25.678
SING THE OVERALL GOALS ARE

01:51:25.745 --> 01:51:27.280
ACHIEVED IN A COST EFFECTIVE WAY

01:51:27.347 --> 01:51:28.448
WE THINK THE CAP AND TRADE

01:51:28.515 --> 01:51:30.750
PROGRAM CONTRIBUTES IMPORTANTLY.

01:51:30.817 --> 01:51:32.986
TO THAT OUTCOME. SO WITH THIS

01:51:33.053 --> 01:51:34.821
LOT LOT SIZEABLE LOANS BANK

01:51:34.888 --> 01:51:37.390
BEFORE US THE COMMITTEE HOUSE OF

01:51:37.457 --> 01:51:39.025
STUDY POTENTIAL APPROACHES TO

01:51:39.092 --> 01:51:41.061
REFORMING THE MARKET THE DEAL

01:51:41.127 --> 01:51:43.329
WITH THE EXISTING ALONE SPENT.

01:51:43.396 --> 01:51:45.832
WE THINK REDUCING ALLOW SUPPLY

01:51:45.899 --> 01:51:47.067
CAN BE ACHIEVED BY THE AIR

01:51:47.133 --> 01:51:48.268
RESOURCES BOARD USING ITS

01:51:48.334 --> 01:51:50.403
AUTHORITY THAT'S THE THAT'S THE

01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:51.671
AND THAT IT HAS PREVIOUSLY USED

01:51:51.738 --> 01:51:54.074
THE SUB LEVEL THE PRICE FLOOR

01:51:54.140 --> 01:51:56.609
AND THE CEILING. IMPORTANTLY

01:51:56.676 --> 01:51:58.344
POLICY MEMBERS MIGHT WANT

01:51:58.411 --> 01:51:59.913
POLICYMAKERS MIGHT WANT TO

01:51:59.979 --> 01:52:01.915
ENSURE THAT REFORMS TO REDUCE

01:52:01.981 --> 01:52:03.283
ALLOWED SUPPLY DOES NOT

01:52:03.349 --> 01:52:05.485
DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT THE

01:52:05.552 --> 01:52:07.687
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND.

01:52:07.754 --> 01:52:08.822
WHICH ENABLE NUMEROUS CLIMATE

01:52:08.888 --> 01:52:10.957
RELATED INVESTMENTS OVER HALF OF

01:52:11.024 --> 01:52:13.593
THESE ABOUT A INVESTMENTS ACCRUE

01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:14.627
TO THE BENEFIT OF DISADVANTAGED

01:52:14.694 --> 01:52:16.596
COMMUNITIES AND US FOR EXAMPLE

01:52:16.663 --> 01:52:18.665
THE DRAFT E. JOCKS SCOPING PLAN

01:52:18.731 --> 01:52:20.834
RECOMMENDATIONS POINT OUT. NO

01:52:20.900 --> 01:52:22.435
ONE RECOGNIZES THE URGENCY OF

01:52:22.502 --> 01:52:23.837
OUR CLIMATE CRISIS MORE THAN

01:52:23.903 --> 01:52:25.872
FRONTLINE COMMUNITY RESIDENTS

01:52:25.939 --> 01:52:28.208
THOSE VIDAK RECOMMENDATIONS LIST

01:52:28.274 --> 01:52:30.610
MANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXPANDED

01:52:30.677 --> 01:52:31.077
INVESTMENT IN AFFECTED

01:52:31.144 --> 01:52:33.880
COMMUNITIES. FOR THE EIMAC

01:52:33.947 --> 01:52:34.647
REPORT MAKES SPECIFIC

01:52:34.714 --> 01:52:36.683
RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO ADJUST

01:52:36.749 --> 01:52:38.751
THE LEVEL SUPPLY WHILE ALSO

01:52:38.818 --> 01:52:40.019
MAINTAINING OR INCREASING

01:52:40.086 --> 01:52:41.354
REVENUE TO THE GREENHOUSE GAS

01:52:41.421 --> 01:52:44.591
REDUCTION FUND. AND A KEY IDEA

01:52:44.657 --> 01:52:46.626
IS THIS. THAT IF ONLY STATE

01:52:46.693 --> 01:52:48.495
OWNED AUCTION ALLOWED SUPPLIES

01:52:48.561 --> 01:52:50.096
ARE REDUCED THE REVENUES THE

01:52:50.163 --> 01:52:52.132
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND

01:52:52.198 --> 01:52:54.467
WOULDN'T EVIDENTLY FALL. TO

01:52:54.534 --> 01:52:56.436
AVOID THIS REDUCTION IN REVENUE

01:52:56.503 --> 01:52:57.904
THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION

01:52:57.971 --> 01:52:59.672
FUND EACH SOURCE OF SUPPLY THAT

01:52:59.739 --> 01:53:01.007
IS ABOUT HALF THE ALLOWANCES

01:53:01.074 --> 01:53:02.408
THAT ARE ISSUED FOR FREE TO

01:53:02.475 --> 01:53:03.576
UTILITIES AND INDUSTRIAL

01:53:03.643 --> 01:53:05.845
ENTITIES AND HALF THAT ARE SOLD

01:53:05.912 --> 01:53:07.947
THROUGH THE AUCTION EACH SOURCE

01:53:08.014 --> 01:53:09.916
OF ALLOW SUPPLY NEEDS TO BE

01:53:09.983 --> 01:53:11.784
REDUCED PROPORTIONALLY. I

01:53:11.851 --> 01:53:13.553
BELIEVE THIS CAN BE DONE UNDER A

01:53:13.620 --> 01:53:15.388
ABUSE AUTHORITY TO ADJUST

01:53:15.455 --> 01:53:17.257
OVERALL LOANS COUNT. THE

01:53:17.323 --> 01:53:18.992
COMMITTEE IDENTIFIES TWO WAYS

01:53:19.058 --> 01:53:21.394
THAT ALLOW SUPPLY CAN BE REDUCED

01:53:21.461 --> 01:53:23.563
ONE IS A SO THE FIRST THAT WOULD

01:53:23.630 --> 01:53:25.198
MIGHT OCCUR TO YOU IT'S A IT'S A

01:53:25.265 --> 01:53:25.698
DIRECT APPROACH ADDRESS

01:53:25.765 --> 01:53:26.866
CUMULATIVE SUPPLY BY REDUCING

01:53:26.933 --> 01:53:28.434
THE NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES ARE

01:53:28.501 --> 01:53:30.303
ISSUED EACH YEAR GOING FORWARD.

01:53:30.370 --> 01:53:31.971
THIS TYPE OF MARKET REFORM HAS

01:53:32.038 --> 01:53:33.273
BEEN DONE PREVIOUSLY IN THE

01:53:33.339 --> 01:53:35.141
EUROPEAN UNION AND TWICE IN THE

01:53:35.208 --> 01:53:37.110
REGIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS

01:53:37.177 --> 01:53:38.811
INITIATIVE. TO GOOD EFFECT. A

01:53:38.878 --> 01:53:40.480
SECOND APPROACH TO MARK EFORM

01:53:40.547 --> 01:53:41.681
WOULD BE TO ADD FURTHER

01:53:41.748 --> 01:53:43.349
STRUCTURE TO THE MARKET BY

01:53:43.416 --> 01:53:44.684
MAKING THE SUPPLY OF ALLOWANCES

01:53:44.751 --> 01:53:46.953
MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE PRICE OF

01:53:47.020 --> 01:53:49.088
ALLOWANCES. ONE APPROACH WOULD

01:53:49.155 --> 01:53:50.957
BE TO INCREASE THE PRICE FOR.

01:53:51.024 --> 01:53:52.692
PERHAPS A BETTER APPROACH WOULD

01:53:52.759 --> 01:53:55.261
BE TO ADD ADDITIONAL PRICE STEPS

01:53:55.328 --> 01:53:57.597
IN THE ALLOWED SUPPLY FORMULA.

01:53:57.664 --> 01:53:58.831
REGGIE DID THIS IT ADDED AN

01:53:58.898 --> 01:54:00.200
ADDITIONAL PRICE STEP CALLED THE

01:54:00.266 --> 01:54:03.469
EMISSIONS CONTAINERS URBAN

01:54:03.536 --> 01:54:04.270
TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND

01:54:04.337 --> 01:54:06.005
WASHINGTON STATE INTENDS TO DO

01:54:06.072 --> 01:54:07.407
THIS AND DEVELOPING REGULATIONS

01:54:07.473 --> 01:54:09.576
FOR THEIR PROGRAM. THIS APPROACH

01:54:09.642 --> 01:54:11.110
COULD CHANGE ALLOWED SUPPLY

01:54:11.177 --> 01:54:12.812
INCREMENTALLY BY HARVESTING

01:54:12.879 --> 01:54:14.847
ADDITIONAL EMISSION REDUCTIONS

01:54:14.914 --> 01:54:16.382
ONE ALLOWANCE PRICES ARE LOW.

01:54:16.449 --> 01:54:17.717
AND THIS APPROACH DOES NOT HAVE

01:54:17.784 --> 01:54:19.018
TO BE DONE EXCLUSIVE OTHER

01:54:19.085 --> 01:54:20.954
REFORMS BUT IT IS ONE THAT WOULD

01:54:21.020 --> 01:54:23.122
MAKE THE MARKET WORK MORE ROBUST

01:54:23.189 --> 01:54:24.324
TO THE KIND OF CHANGES THAT ONE

01:54:24.390 --> 01:54:25.792
CANNOT ANTICIPATE GOING FORWARD

01:54:25.858 --> 01:54:27.126
BUT WORK FOR WHICH MARKETS

01:54:27.193 --> 01:54:29.629
PERFORM SO WELL. WHEN THEY'RE

01:54:29.696 --> 01:54:31.130
SET UP PROPERLY. THE COMMITTEE

01:54:31.197 --> 01:54:33.032
HAD TWO OTHER COMMENTS ON TO

01:54:33.099 --> 01:54:37.103
OTHER INSURANCE. ONE IS OFFSETS

01:54:37.170 --> 01:54:38.605
OFFSETS EFFECTIVELY CONTRIBUTE

01:54:38.671 --> 01:54:39.906
TO THE ALLOWED SUPPLY BECAUSE

01:54:39.973 --> 01:54:41.741
ALSO TO OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE

01:54:41.808 --> 01:54:43.610
COMPLIANCE INSTRUMENT THAT IS

01:54:43.676 --> 01:54:45.612
ADDITIONAL TO THE CUP. FORCE

01:54:45.678 --> 01:54:47.247
CONSTITUTE ABOUT 80% OF ALL OF

01:54:47.313 --> 01:54:49.782
OFFICE SUPPLY GOODS CONCERN

01:56:29.248 --> 01:56:31.918
HOW CHANGES OCCUR MARKETS DO NOT

01:56:31.984 --> 01:56:34.520

ADMINISTRATIVE INTERVENTION THE

01:56:45.631 --> 01:56:46.733
MARKET. US SUGGESTED ANOTHER

01:56:46.799 --> 01:56:48.634
MARKETS PRICE MIGHT BE JUST

01:56:48.701 --> 01:56:50.670
AROUND THE CORNER. AND THAT THE

01:56:50.737 --> 01:56:52.205
PUBLIC IS REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY

01:56:52.271 --> 01:56:53.539
THAT UNDERMINES INNOVATION AND

01:56:53.606 --> 01:56:55.208
INVESTMENT AT LEAST AS MOTIVATED

01:56:55.274 --> 01:56:56.743
BY THE MARKETS ARE REDUCES THE

INFLUENCE OF THE MARKET WHICH WE

01:56:58.544 --> 01:56:59.679
THINK IS THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE

01:56:59.746 --> 01:57:01.881

ADJUSTMENTS SUCH AS PRICE STEPS

01:57:10.957 --> 01:57:12.825
TO CONTROL ALLOW SUPPLY THAT'S

01:57:12.892 --> 01:57:15.294
ESPECIALLY ADVANTAGEOUS BECAUSE

01:57:15.361 --> 01:57:17.230
THEY TAKE EFFECT AUTOMATICALLY

01:57:17.296 --> 01:57:20.066
TO CORRECT THE MARKET AS THE

02:01:52.972 --> 02:01:54.407
AGAIN THESE BENEFITS ARE COMING

02:01:54.473 --> 02:01:56.609
AT A VERY HIGH COST AND THE COST

02:01:56.676 --> 02:01:58.344
CLEARLY ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED

02:01:58.411 --> 02:02:00.212
EQUALLY. WHILE CALIFORNIA'S

02:02:00.279 --> 02:02:02.248
GEOGRAPHY IS WIDELY VARIABLE

02:02:02.314 --> 02:02:04.250
CULTURALLY AND PHYSICALLY OUR

02:02:04.316 --> 02:02:06.352
ROUTE PROBLEMS REMAIN THE SAME.

02:02:06.419 --> 02:02:08.654
RACISM EXPLOITATION AND

02:02:08.721 --> 02:02:11.357
EXTRACTION. WE KNOW THE TO MEET

02:02:11.424 --> 02:02:12.458
CLEAN AIR AND CLIMATE GOALS WE

02:02:12.525 --> 02:02:14.160
HAVE TO FOCUS ON DIRECT

02:02:14.226 --> 02:02:17.296
REDUCTIONS. THE AIR RESOURCES

02:02:17.363 --> 02:02:18.998
BOARD'S ORIGINAL CHARGE IS TO

02:02:19.065 --> 02:02:20.833
MEET CLEAN AIR GOALS AND WHILE

02:02:20.900 --> 02:02:22.468
THEY'RE HAILED AS A LEADER IN

02:02:22.535 --> 02:02:24.603
MANY ASPECTS CLEARLY FOR CLEAN

02:02:24.670 --> 02:02:26.706
AIR WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO. WE

02:02:26.772 --> 02:02:28.407
DO CELEBRATE ACKNOWLEDGE AND

02:02:28.474 --> 02:02:29.642
RECOGNIZE THE GLOBAL

02:02:29.709 --> 02:02:30.910
SIGNIFICANCE OF CARBS

02:02:30.976 --> 02:02:33.512
COMMITMENTS ON CARS AND TRUCKS

02:02:33.579 --> 02:02:34.480
AND THEIR IMPRESSIVE HIGH

02:02:34.547 --> 02:02:36.048
COMPLIANCE RATES THAT AND

02:02:36.115 --> 02:02:38.250
ENFORCEMENT REPORTS SHOW. AT THE

02:02:38.317 --> 02:02:40.619
SAME TIME WE HAVE TO PLACE THOSE

02:02:40.686 --> 02:02:42.021
NEXT TWO BROKEN PROCESSES WITH

02:02:42.088 --> 02:02:44.557
OUR AREA AGENCIES THAT RESULT IN

02:02:44.623 --> 02:02:46.459
A MISUSE OF MONEY AND POWER

02:02:46.525 --> 02:02:47.827
THERE ARE NUMEROUS LAWSUITS

02:02:47.893 --> 02:02:49.061
REGARDING FIELD PLANTS THAT I

02:02:49.128 --> 02:02:50.629
COULD POINT TO BUT INSTEAD I

02:02:50.696 --> 02:02:52.732
WANT TO USE TO SPECIFIC EXAMPLES

02:02:52.798 --> 02:02:54.700
OF PROCESSES THAT I PARTICIPATE

02:02:54.767 --> 02:02:56.569
IN. THAT I THINK EXHIBIT OUR

02:02:56.635 --> 02:02:58.738
OVER RELIANCE ON TECHNOLOGY AND

02:02:58.804 --> 02:03:01.173
INCENTIVES THAT CONTINUED TO

02:03:01.240 --> 02:03:03.142
WIDEN AND DEEPEN DISPARITIES AND

02:03:03.209 --> 02:03:05.010
IMPACTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL

02:03:05.077 --> 02:03:06.946
JUSTICE COMMUNITIES. SO FOR ONE

02:03:07.012 --> 02:03:08.347
I SERVE ON THE STOCKTON STEERING

02:03:08.414 --> 02:03:09.782
COMMITTEE FOR THE COMMUNITY-

02:03:09.849 --> 02:03:11.984
PROTECTION PROGRAMMER AB SIX ONE

02:03:12.051 --> 02:03:13.419
SEVEN WHICH I BELIEVE TO BE A

02:03:13.486 --> 02:03:15.454
VISIONARY AND COMMUNITY ENGAGED

02:03:15.521 --> 02:03:17.389
PARTICIPATORY PROCESS THAT

02:03:17.456 --> 02:03:19.291
UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE EXPERIENCE.

02:03:19.358 --> 02:03:21.093
AS MANAGED BY THE SAN JOAQUIN

02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:22.461
VALLEY AIR DISTRICT AS AN

02:03:22.528 --> 02:03:24.263
ONGOING DEBATE OVER HOW TO

02:03:24.330 --> 02:03:26.665
INVEST DOLLARS AN EQUITABLE WAYS

02:03:26.732 --> 02:03:28.434
WITH FIVE MILLION DOLLARS

02:03:28.501 --> 02:03:30.035
PUNITIVELY REMOVED FROM THE

02:03:30.102 --> 02:03:31.737
COMMUNITIES BUDGET. BECAUSE WE

02:03:31.804 --> 02:03:33.372
DIDN'T VOTE FOR MEASURES THAT

02:03:33.439 --> 02:03:35.174
THE AIR DISTRICT WANTED THAT

02:03:35.241 --> 02:03:36.809
WOULD HAVE GONE TO ONE OF THE

02:03:36.876 --> 02:03:38.043
LARGEST SOURCES OF POLLUTION IN

02:03:38.110 --> 02:03:39.078
THE AREA OUT WITHOUT

02:03:39.145 --> 02:03:40.846
ACCOUNTABILITY OR OVERSIGHT

02:03:40.913 --> 02:03:42.248
MECHANISMS THAT WERE REQUESTED

02:03:42.314 --> 02:03:43.482
BY THE COMMUNITY STEERING

02:03:43.549 --> 02:03:45.151
COMMITTEE. THAT SETS A DANGEROUS

02:03:45.217 --> 02:03:46.852
PRECEDENT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

02:03:46.919 --> 02:03:47.953
JUSTICE COMMUNITY MEMBERS

02:03:48.020 --> 02:03:49.688
SPEAKING THEIR PRIORITIES AND

02:03:49.755 --> 02:03:52.158
BEING PUNISHED FOR IT. I ALSO

02:03:52.224 --> 02:03:53.659
FOR MANY YEARS HAVE WORK IN

02:03:53.726 --> 02:03:55.294
WORKS TO REPAIR THE BROKEN

02:03:55.361 --> 02:03:56.529
EMISSION REDUCTION CREDIT

02:03:56.595 --> 02:03:57.563
PROGRAM MANAGED BY THE SAN

02:03:57.630 --> 02:03:59.431
JOAQUIN VALLEY OR DISTRICT WHICH

02:03:59.498 --> 02:04:01.300
IN SOME WAYS IS A PARALLEL TO

02:04:01.367 --> 02:04:02.735
THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM FOR

02:04:02.802 --> 02:04:04.270
CRITERIA AIR POLLUTANTS. THE

02:04:04.336 --> 02:04:05.838
FAILURES OF THE SYSTEM

02:04:05.905 --> 02:04:07.640
DEMONSTRATE DEEP CORRUPTION IN

02:04:07.706 --> 02:04:09.408
OFFSETTING SYSTEMS AND NOT

02:04:09.475 --> 02:04:11.644
COINCIDENTLY HAS FAVORED THE OIL

02:04:11.710 --> 02:04:13.779
INDUSTRY AND DESPITE THE AIR

02:04:13.846 --> 02:04:15.915
RESOURCES BOARD U. S. EPA AND

02:04:15.981 --> 02:04:17.449
THE AIR DISTRICT AGREEING THAT

02:04:17.516 --> 02:04:19.218
THE PROGRAM HAS FAILED. THERE IS

02:04:19.285 --> 02:04:21.487
NO PLAN TO RECONCILE THE KNOWN

02:04:21.554 --> 02:04:22.988
DAMAGE TO ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

02:04:23.055 --> 02:04:24.356
COMMUNITIES CAUSED BY THE

02:04:24.423 --> 02:04:26.125
FAILURES OF THE BANK ONLY TO

02:04:26.192 --> 02:04:27.793
MAKE FORWARD FACING CHANGES TO

02:04:27.860 --> 02:04:29.361
THE PROGRAM. SO IN THESE

02:04:29.428 --> 02:04:30.996
EXAMPLES WE SEE THAT CARBS

02:04:31.063 --> 02:04:32.464
OVERSIGHT ROLE OVER OUR AIR

02:04:32.531 --> 02:04:34.934
DISTRICTS WHO CONTROL IMPORTANT

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:36.836
STATIONARY AND AREA WIDE SOURCES

02:04:36.902 --> 02:04:39.405
IS FAILING. AND THAT WE NEED TO

02:04:39.471 --> 02:04:40.339
DO MORE TO ENSURE THAT AIR

02:04:40.406 --> 02:04:41.774
DISTRICTS ARE ADOPTING AND

02:04:41.841 --> 02:04:43.409
ENFORCING THE BEST RULES AND

02:04:43.475 --> 02:04:46.645
POLICIES FOR CLEAN AIR AND

02:04:46.712 --> 02:04:48.047
CLIMATE GOALS. SO SEGUEING TO

02:04:48.113 --> 02:04:49.515
DISCUSSING THE SCOPING PLAN

02:04:49.582 --> 02:04:51.383
PROCESS AND MY PARTICIPATION AS

02:04:51.450 --> 02:04:53.085
AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE-

02:04:53.152 --> 02:04:54.720
COMMITTEE MEMBER IT ABSOLUTELY

02:04:54.787 --> 02:04:57.623
HAS BEEN HURRIED AND RUSHED- WE

02:04:57.690 --> 02:04:59.658
RECOGNIZE THAT CARP STAFF ARE

02:04:59.725 --> 02:05:00.993
CONTINUALLY WORKING ON THEIR

02:05:01.060 --> 02:05:02.528
REGULATORY PROGRAMS AND THIS

02:05:02.595 --> 02:05:04.396
PLAN COMES UP TO BE. UPDATED

02:05:04.463 --> 02:05:07.166
EVERY FIVE YEARS- THE PROCESS

02:05:07.233 --> 02:05:08.701
HAS BEEN OVERWHELMING AND

02:05:08.767 --> 02:05:10.436
FRANKLY HAS MOVED SO QUICKLY

02:05:10.502 --> 02:05:12.204
THAT IT HAS CAUGHT OUT MANY

02:05:12.271 --> 02:05:13.405
OPPORTUNITIES TO HAVE

02:05:13.472 --> 02:05:15.140
SUBSTANTIVE INPUT FROM FRONTLINE

02:05:15.207 --> 02:05:17.042
COMMUNITIES. AND EXHIBITS AN

02:05:17.109 --> 02:05:18.878
UNDERLYING DYNAMIC THAT

02:05:18.944 --> 02:05:20.512
CONTINUES TO DISADVANTAGED

02:05:20.579 --> 02:05:22.548
GROUPS WITH LESS RESOURCES.

02:05:22.615 --> 02:05:24.149
AGAIN IT'S JUST ONE SPECIFIC

02:05:24.216 --> 02:05:26.285
EXAMPLE WITHIN A COUPLE OF WEEKS

02:05:26.352 --> 02:05:28.020
OF BEING APPOINTED TO THE

02:05:28.087 --> 02:05:29.255
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ADVISORY

02:05:29.321 --> 02:05:31.891
COMMITTEE. ALMOST AN ENTIRE WEEK

02:05:31.957 --> 02:05:33.792
OF SEVERAL BACK TO BACK DAYS OF

02:05:33.859 --> 02:05:35.461
MULTI OUR WORKSHOPS WERE

02:05:35.527 --> 02:05:37.596
SCHEDULED AND INITIALLY WITH NO

02:05:37.663 --> 02:05:39.298
BREAKS UNTIL WE REQUESTED THEM.

02:05:39.365 --> 02:05:42.001
SINCE JUNE WE'VE HAD FIFTEEN

02:05:42.067 --> 02:05:43.302
MEETINGS OF VIDAK OFFICIAL

02:05:43.369 --> 02:05:44.737
MEETINGS THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE

02:05:44.803 --> 02:05:46.772
PREP AND DEBRIEF WORKGROUPS OR

02:05:46.839 --> 02:05:49.942
WORKSHOPS- AND MANY OF US ARE AS

02:05:50.009 --> 02:05:51.410
YOU ALL ARE SERVING IN MANY

02:05:51.477 --> 02:05:53.646
OTHER ROLES SO I KNOW WE'RE ALL

02:05:53.712 --> 02:05:54.713
BUSY I WON'T BELABOR THE POINT

02:05:54.780 --> 02:05:56.749
BUT WE HAVE RAISED MANY TIMES

02:05:56.815 --> 02:05:58.751
CONCERNS. ABOUT THE ALIGNMENT

02:05:58.817 --> 02:06:00.319
BETWEEN THE TIMELINE AND THE

02:06:00.386 --> 02:06:01.553
OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE

02:06:01.620 --> 02:06:04.056
SUBSTANTIVE FEEDBACK IN ORDER TO

02:06:04.123 --> 02:06:06.258
SHAPE THE MODELING. MODELING IS

02:06:06.325 --> 02:06:07.793
A FUNDAMENTAL AND UNDERLYING

02:06:07.860 --> 02:06:09.261
ASPECT OF WHAT GOES INTO THE

02:06:09.328 --> 02:06:11.030
SCOPING PLAN AND MODELS ARE

02:06:11.096 --> 02:06:13.599
TOOLS THAT ARE USED AS A MEANS

02:06:13.666 --> 02:06:15.200
TO AN END. IF YOU PUT FAULTY

02:06:15.267 --> 02:06:16.869
ASSUMPTIONS INTO A MODEL YOU'RE

02:06:16.936 --> 02:06:18.904
GOING TO GET BAD INPUT OUTPUTS

02:06:18.971 --> 02:06:21.173
AT THE END. STAFF HAVE NOT FULLY

02:06:21.240 --> 02:06:22.274
RELEASED THEIR UNDERLYING

02:06:22.341 --> 02:06:24.376
ASSUMPTIONS WHICH INHIBITS OUR

02:06:24.443 --> 02:06:25.678
ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE

02:06:25.744 --> 02:06:27.246
SUBSTANTIVE FEEDBACK AT THIS

02:06:27.313 --> 02:06:28.948
STAGE IN THE PROCESS. AND NOW WE

02:06:29.014 --> 02:06:30.549
HAVE SCENARIOS RELEASED AND

02:06:30.616 --> 02:06:31.951
ALREADY STAFF RECOMMENDING A

02:06:32.017 --> 02:06:33.719
SCENARIO BEFORE WE'VE BEEN ABLE

02:06:33.786 --> 02:06:35.287
TO FULLY ANALYZE EVEN WHAT'S

02:06:35.354 --> 02:06:37.656
BEEN MODELED. THERE ARE ALSO

02:06:37.723 --> 02:06:39.258
TROUBLING ASSUMPTIONS IN THE

02:06:39.325 --> 02:06:41.927
MODELING AS IT EXISTS RIGHT NOW-

02:06:41.994 --> 02:06:43.095
PRETTY MUCH FROM THE BEGINNING

02:06:43.162 --> 02:06:45.998
OF THIS PROCESS ALMOST EVERY

02:06:46.065 --> 02:06:46.632
WORKSHOP CARB STAFF HAVE STATED

02:06:46.699 --> 02:06:48.600
THAT ENGINEERED CARBON CAPTURE

02:06:48.667 --> 02:06:49.401
AND STORAGE IS GOING TO BE

02:06:49.468 --> 02:06:52.338
REQUIRED. THIS MODELING NOW HAS

02:06:52.404 --> 02:06:53.806
UNREALISTIC ASSUMPTIONS SUCH AS

02:06:53.872 --> 02:06:56.041
A 90% CAPTURE RATE FOR

02:06:56.108 --> 02:06:57.009
ENGINEERED CARBON CAPTURE AND

02:06:57.076 --> 02:06:58.677
STORAGE WHICH IS NOT REALISTIC

02:06:58.744 --> 02:06:59.578
AND HAS NOT BEEN PROVEN

02:06:59.645 --> 02:07:02.214
ANYWHERE- AND FURTHERMORE WE ARE

02:07:02.281 --> 02:07:04.016
UNDERESTIMATING THE POTENTIAL

02:07:04.083 --> 02:07:05.551
FOR NORTH NATURAL SOURCES OF

02:07:05.617 --> 02:07:07.152
CARBON SEQUESTRATION WHICH AGAIN

02:07:07.219 --> 02:07:08.721
IS WHERE WE SHOULD FOCUS.

02:07:08.787 --> 02:07:10.956
FUNDAMENTALLY WE'RE NOT ON TRACK

02:07:11.023 --> 02:07:11.957
FOR TWENTY THIRTY GOALS AND

02:07:12.024 --> 02:07:14.927
MODELS ARE THEORY SO WE NEED THE

02:07:14.994 --> 02:07:15.728
ACTUAL APPLICATION TO FOLLOW

02:07:15.794 --> 02:07:18.263
THROUGH. NOT ALL SOLUTIONS CAN

02:07:18.330 --> 02:07:20.566
BE TECHNOLOGY BASED SO IN THE

02:07:20.632 --> 02:07:22.501
WORK THAT WE DO IN THE SAN

02:07:22.568 --> 02:07:23.469
JOAQUIN VALLEY MANY PEOPLE HAVE

02:07:23.535 --> 02:07:25.637
SUGGESTED TO ME MAYBE WE COULD

02:07:25.704 --> 02:07:26.872
JUST GET GIANT FANS AND BLOW THE

02:07:26.939 --> 02:07:28.741
AIR POLLUTION TO SOMEWHERE ELSE

02:07:28.807 --> 02:07:29.908
BUT- FUNDAMENTALLY THAT'S NOT

02:07:29.975 --> 02:07:31.310
WHAT WE WANT TO DO AT THE END OF

02:07:31.377 --> 02:07:33.312
THE DAY RIGHT. AND NOW IN THE

02:07:33.379 --> 02:07:34.646
VALLEY WE HAVE MULTIPLE PROPOSED

02:07:34.713 --> 02:07:36.081
PROJECTS TO ESSENTIALLY TAKE

02:07:36.148 --> 02:07:38.450
GIANT TUBES AND PIPES AND LOCK

02:07:38.517 --> 02:07:39.985
CARBON UNDERGROUND FOREVER WITH

02:07:40.052 --> 02:07:41.887
LITTLE TO NO CONSEQUENCES AND I

02:07:41.954 --> 02:07:43.555
WISH THAT THAT MAGICAL THINKING

02:07:43.622 --> 02:07:45.791
WAS POSSIBLE. BUT AGAIN WE HAVE

02:07:45.858 --> 02:07:47.826
TO BE REALISTIC AND MOVE FROM

02:07:47.893 --> 02:07:50.262
ASPIRATIONS TO ACTIONS THAT ARE

02:07:50.329 --> 02:07:53.098
EQUITY CENTERED. BECAUSE HOW WE

02:07:53.165 --> 02:07:55.000
ACHIEVE OUR GOALS IS AS

02:07:55.067 --> 02:07:56.068
IMPORTANT AS ACHIEVING OUR

02:07:56.135 --> 02:07:58.604
GOALS. I DO HAVE HOPE IN THE

02:07:58.670 --> 02:08:00.606
WORK THAT WE DO IN EACH RACK AND

02:08:00.672 --> 02:08:02.241
I WAS THE CENTRAL VALLEY AIR

02:08:02.307 --> 02:08:03.776
QUALITY COALITION. THAT WE CAN

02:08:03.842 --> 02:08:04.910
CO POWER WITH PARTNER

02:08:04.977 --> 02:08:06.678
ORGANIZATIONS AND WITH FRONTLINE

02:08:06.745 --> 02:08:09.314
COMMUNITIES TO MAKE INVESTMENTS

02:08:09.381 --> 02:08:11.450
IN ZERO CARBON INFRASTRUCTURE

02:08:11.517 --> 02:08:13.919
AND EQUITABLE PUBLIC SERVICES.

02:08:13.986 --> 02:08:15.954
THAT SUPPORT COMMUNITY WELLBEING

02:08:16.021 --> 02:08:18.290
AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. I

02:08:18.357 --> 02:08:19.458
WANT TO EXPRESS GREAT

02:08:19.525 --> 02:08:21.460
APPRECIATION FOR ALL OF THE

02:08:21.527 --> 02:08:22.728

AGAIN IT'S JUST AT THIS POINT IN

02:08:36.675 --> 02:08:38.043
THE PROCESS BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T

02:08:38.110 --> 02:08:40.145
HAD A CHANCE TO WEIGH IN ON. THE

02:08:40.212 --> 02:08:41.513

02:08:49.321 --> 02:08:49.788
RECOMMENDATIONS TOGETHER

02:08:49.855 --> 02:08:50.789
THERE'VE ALSO BEEN COMMUNITY

02:08:50.856 --> 02:08:52.558
COALITIONS WORKING TO INFORM THE

02:08:52.624 --> 02:08:54.493

02:09:07.106 --> 02:09:09.041
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT WORKSHOP

02:09:09.108 --> 02:09:10.776
THE FIRST AND ONLY ONE THAT'S

02:09:25.858 --> 02:09:27.392
ARCHING QUESTION THAT WE ASK

02:09:27.459 --> 02:09:29.528
THEM WAS. WHAT WOULD YOU TELL

02:09:29.595 --> 02:09:30.762
THE GOVERNOR AND THE STATE

02:09:30.829 --> 02:09:32.364
GOVERNMENT THAT YOU WANT IN THE

02:09:32.431 --> 02:09:34.233
SCOPING PLAN AND THAT YOU WANT

02:09:34.299 --> 02:09:35.367
FROM CLIMATE JUSTICE. I

02:09:35.434 --> 02:09:36.468
SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL AND

02:09:36.535 --> 02:09:39.404
ATTACHMENT OF A- VISUAL SKETCH

02:09:39.471 --> 02:09:41.273
FROM A SKETCH ARTIST IT'S CALLED

02:09:41.340 --> 02:09:43.242
A MENTAL MAP. THAT REALLY

02:09:43.308 --> 02:09:44.710
SUMMARIZES AND HIGHLIGHTS SOME

02:09:44.776 --> 02:09:46.512
OF THE KEY THEMES OF WHAT WE

02:09:46.578 --> 02:09:47.579
WERE HEARING FROM COMMUNITY

02:09:47.646 --> 02:09:49.615
MEMBERS IN THESE SESSIONS. AND

02:09:49.681 --> 02:09:52.284
AGAIN WE HEAR- OPTIMISM AND

02:09:52.351 --> 02:09:54.086
EXCITEMENT FOR INVESTMENTS THAT

02:09:54.153 --> 02:09:55.554
CAN BE TAILORED ACROSS

02:09:55.621 --> 02:09:57.523
TRANSPORTATION BUILDINGS FOOD

02:09:57.589 --> 02:09:59.424
ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT FACTORS

02:09:59.491 --> 02:10:00.626
THAT AFFECT PEOPLE'S DAILY

02:10:00.692 --> 02:10:03.061
LIVES. JUXTAPOSED WITH A FEAR OF

02:10:03.128 --> 02:10:05.063
CONTINUING TO BE LEFT BEHIND BY

02:10:05.130 --> 02:10:06.598
THESE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE MADE

02:10:06.665 --> 02:10:08.033
FOR COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T LOOK

02:10:08.100 --> 02:10:10.636
LIKE OUR FRONTLINE ENVIRONMENTAL

02:10:10.702 --> 02:10:12.237
JUSTICE COMMUNITIES. OFTENTIMES

02:10:12.304 --> 02:10:14.106
WHEN WE RAISE THESE BIG AND BOLD

02:10:14.173 --> 02:10:15.307
VISIONS AS THE ENVIRONMENTAL

02:10:15.374 --> 02:10:16.775
JUSTICE MOVEMENT WE HEAR FROM

02:10:16.842 --> 02:10:18.310
AGENCIES LIKE THE CARROT

02:10:18.377 --> 02:10:20.012
CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD.

02:10:20.078 --> 02:10:22.181
THAT'S NOT OUR AUTHORITY OR WE

02:10:22.247 --> 02:10:24.183
CAN'T DO THAT RIGHT NOW. THE

02:10:24.249 --> 02:10:26.051
SCOPING PLAN IS AN IMPORTANT

02:10:26.118 --> 02:10:28.053
EXERCISE THAT SENDS MARKET AND

02:10:28.120 --> 02:10:29.955
POLICY SIGNALS RELATED TO KEY

02:10:30.022 --> 02:10:32.624
TECHNOLOGY CHOICES AND WE WANT

02:10:32.691 --> 02:10:34.226
THE RIGHT INVESTMENTS IN OUR

02:10:34.293 --> 02:10:36.161
COMMUNITIES AND RECOGNITION.

02:10:36.228 --> 02:10:38.230
THAT MONEY AND TECHNOLOGY WILL

02:10:38.297 --> 02:10:40.632
NOT SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM. THE

02:10:40.699 --> 02:10:42.401
SCOPING PLAN PROVIDES STATE

02:10:42.467 --> 02:10:44.136
DIRECTION ON HOW TO MEET CLIMATE

02:10:44.203 --> 02:10:46.171
GOALS AND AN ACTIONABLE VISION

02:10:46.238 --> 02:10:49.675
THAT MUST INCORPORATE EQUITY

02:10:49.741 --> 02:10:51.109
RESILIENCE AND JUSTICE. WHILE I

02:10:51.176 --> 02:10:52.844
KNOW THAT YOU JACK

02:10:52.911 --> 02:10:54.112
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE LENGTHY I

02:10:54.179 --> 02:10:54.746
WOULD PARTICULARLY POINT YOU TO

02:10:54.813 --> 02:10:56.381
THE LAST COUPLE OF PAGES WHERE

02:10:56.448 --> 02:10:57.683
THERE'S A CHART PUT TOGETHER BY

02:10:57.749 --> 02:10:59.017
GROUPS OF SPECIFIC

02:10:59.084 --> 02:11:01.587
RECOMMENDATIONS. ON ACTIONABLE

02:11:01.653 --> 02:11:02.754
MEASURES FOR US TO MEET OUR

02:11:02.821 --> 02:11:04.289
GOALS. TRULY THERE NEEDS TO BE

02:11:04.356 --> 02:11:05.524
COORDINATION ACROSS THE

02:11:05.591 --> 02:11:07.259
DIVISIONS OF THE AIR RESOURCES

02:11:07.326 --> 02:11:08.327
BOARD AND ACROSS THE STATE

02:11:08.393 --> 02:11:11.129
AGENCIES THAT ALL HAVE A STAKE

02:11:11.196 --> 02:11:12.331
IN THE OUTCOMES OF THE SCOPING

02:11:12.397 --> 02:11:14.666
PLAN. SO I CERTAINLY CAN'T DO

02:11:14.733 --> 02:11:16.435
JUSTICE TO ALL TWENTY EIGHT

02:11:16.501 --> 02:11:17.869
PAGES OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS BUT

02:11:17.936 --> 02:11:19.171
THERE ARE A FEW THAT I WANT TO

02:11:19.238 --> 02:11:21.240
HIGHLIGHT FROM SOME OF THE- MOST

02:11:21.306 --> 02:11:23.842
IMPORTANT SECTORS. WHEN YOU SEND

02:11:23.909 --> 02:11:25.410
TRANSPORTATION AS HAS BEEN

02:11:25.477 --> 02:11:26.812
MENTIONED AS AND MAJOR

02:11:26.878 --> 02:11:28.380
CONTRIBUTOR TO GREENHOUSE GAS

02:11:28.447 --> 02:11:29.514
EMISSIONS AND WE KNOW OUR

02:11:29.581 --> 02:11:31.049
COMMUNITIES NEED BETTER

02:11:31.116 --> 02:11:33.418
CONNECTIVITY MOBILITY AND MATT

02:11:33.485 --> 02:11:35.787
MASS TRANSIT. AND TO CONTINUE

02:11:35.854 --> 02:11:37.189
THE AMBITIOUS COMMITMENTS TO

02:11:37.256 --> 02:11:39.124
ELECTRIFICATION WE NEED MORE

02:11:39.191 --> 02:11:41.360
INVESTMENTS AND RAPID BUSES

02:11:41.426 --> 02:11:43.762
LIGHT RAIL ANTI DISPLACEMENT

02:11:43.829 --> 02:11:45.998
AFFORDABLE HOUSING WALKING

02:11:46.064 --> 02:11:48.934
BIKING TO MEET OUR AMBITIOUS

02:11:49.001 --> 02:11:51.503
GOALS AND ACHIEVE REDUCTIONS. AS

02:11:51.570 --> 02:11:52.771
I ALLUDED TO IN MY INTRODUCTION

02:11:52.838 --> 02:11:55.007
INTRODUCTION INTO INDUSTRIALIZED

02:11:55.073 --> 02:11:57.409
AGRICULTURE MUST ALSO TRANSITION

02:11:57.476 --> 02:11:59.811
TO AGROECOLOGICAL PRACTICES WE

02:11:59.878 --> 02:12:02.314
MUST PHASE OUT DAIRY BIO GAS AND

02:12:02.381 --> 02:12:04.383
PETRO CHEMICAL BASED PESTICIDES

02:12:04.449 --> 02:12:07.085
WE NEED AT LEAST A 50% REDUCTION

02:12:07.152 --> 02:12:08.353
IN PESTICIDE USE BY TWENTY

02:12:08.420 --> 02:12:10.222
THIRTY. WE HAVE TO ADDRESS

02:12:10.289 --> 02:12:12.190
FOREST HEALTH WHICH I'M BY NO

02:12:12.257 --> 02:12:13.525
MEANS AND AN EXPERT IN BUT

02:12:13.592 --> 02:12:14.760
UNDERSTAND THAT WITH

02:12:14.826 --> 02:12:18.063
CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE AND VAST.

02:12:18.130 --> 02:12:20.265
ATION OF ECOSYSTEMS BUT AGAIN WE

02:12:20.332 --> 02:12:21.633
NEED TO BE TAILORING SOLUTIONS

02:12:21.700 --> 02:12:22.834
DEPENDING ON THE LOCAL

02:12:22.901 --> 02:12:24.870
ECOSYSTEMS AND COMMUNITIES WE

02:12:24.936 --> 02:12:25.971
NEED TO EMBRACE TRADITIONAL

02:12:26.038 --> 02:12:27.539
ECONOMIC ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE

02:12:27.606 --> 02:12:29.074
AND INDIGENOUS PRACTICES WHICH

02:12:29.141 --> 02:12:30.642
WAS SOMETHING THA WE HEARD A

02:12:30.709 --> 02:12:31.510
LOT IN OUR COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT

02:12:31.576 --> 02:12:33.645
WORKSHOP. AND REALLY AN INTEREST

02:12:33.712 --> 02:12:36.114
IN RESTORING ECOSYSTEMS ACROSS

02:12:36.181 --> 02:12:38.350
RURAL URBAN AND SUBURBAN AREAS

02:12:38.417 --> 02:12:39.851
WITH PRIORITY FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

02:12:39.918 --> 02:12:41.320
JUSTICE COMMUNITIES THAT COULD

02:12:41.386 --> 02:12:43.422
BENEFIT IN MULTIPLE WAYS FROM

02:12:43.488 --> 02:12:45.157
FROM THINGS LIKE INCREASED. TREE

02:12:45.223 --> 02:12:48.393
CANOPY. FUNDAMENTALLY THE STATE

02:12:48.460 --> 02:12:50.262
ALSO NEEDS TO CREATE A PLAN FOR

02:12:50.329 --> 02:12:51.963
HOW WE WILL PHASE OUT FOSSIL

02:12:52.030 --> 02:12:54.599
FUELS IT'S VERY POPULAR RHETORIC

02:12:54.666 --> 02:12:56.168
NOW TO SAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO

02:12:56.234 --> 02:12:57.602
PHASE OUT FOSSIL FUELS IN

02:12:57.669 --> 02:12:58.537
CALIFORNIA BUT HOW WILL WE

02:12:58.603 --> 02:13:00.138
ACTUALLY DO THAT. WE NEED

02:13:00.205 --> 02:13:01.573
CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN CLEAN

02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:03.642
ENERGY AND NO RELIANCE ON

02:13:03.709 --> 02:13:04.976
CLIMATE DEADLINES LIKE CAR

02:13:05.043 --> 02:13:06.345
ENGINEERED CARBON CAPTURE AND

02:13:06.411 --> 02:13:08.580
STORAGE THIS TECHNOLOGY IS

02:13:08.647 --> 02:13:10.882
UNPROVEN IT'S RISKY. AND IT'S

02:13:10.949 --> 02:13:13.452
BEEN STATED. BY CARB STAFF THAT

02:13:13.518 --> 02:13:15.287
ESSENTIALLY TO BE COST EFFECTIVE

02:13:15.354 --> 02:13:16.688
THAT THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS ARE

02:13:16.755 --> 02:13:17.989
GOING TO BE CONCENTRATED IN

02:13:18.056 --> 02:13:19.358
FRONT LINE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

02:13:19.424 --> 02:13:20.625
COMMUNITIES ON EXISTING

02:13:20.692 --> 02:13:22.027
INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE THAT'S

02:13:22.094 --> 02:13:23.829
WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE IT MOST

02:13:23.895 --> 02:13:25.864
COST EFFECTIVE. I WAS STRUCK

02:13:25.931 --> 02:13:27.399
LAST MONTH LISTENING TO THIS

02:13:27.466 --> 02:13:29.067
COMMITTEE HEARING AND HEARING

02:13:29.134 --> 02:13:30.802
THE E. THREE MODELLER WHO SPOKE

02:13:30.869 --> 02:13:32.537
STATING THAT WE COULD IN FACT

02:13:32.604 --> 02:13:33.939
MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS WITHOUT

02:13:34.005 --> 02:13:35.107
ENGINEERED CARBON CAPTURE AND

02:13:35.173 --> 02:13:36.641
STORAGE THOUGH CERTAINLY THE

02:13:36.708 --> 02:13:38.310
CHALLENGE WILL BE DIFFICULT. AND

02:13:38.377 --> 02:13:40.445
I WENT BACK AND READ THROUGH HER

02:13:40.512 --> 02:13:42.447
TESTIMONY AS I WAS PREPARING FOR

02:13:42.514 --> 02:13:44.383
THE HEARING TODAY. AND NOTED

02:13:44.449 --> 02:13:45.984
THAT HER CONCLUDING COMMENT IN

02:13:46.051 --> 02:13:47.919
HER WRITTEN SUMMARIES SAID THE

02:13:47.986 --> 02:13:50.088
PRIMARY CHALLENGE THAT I SEE IS

02:13:50.155 --> 02:13:52.357
NOT A LACK OF AMBITION BUT A

02:13:52.424 --> 02:13:54.693
QUESTION OF HOW WE WILL FINANCE

02:13:54.760 --> 02:13:56.495
THESE NEEDED INVESTMENTS. AND

02:13:56.561 --> 02:13:58.730
RAPIDLY DEPLOY IN ADOPTING NEW

02:13:58.797 --> 02:14:01.666
TECHNOLOGIES IN EVERY SECTOR IN

02:14:01.733 --> 02:14:03.969
A WAY THAT IS EQUITABLE. IN THE

02:14:04.035 --> 02:14:06.037
CATEGORY OF FALSE SOLUTIONS WE

02:14:06.104 --> 02:14:08.206
ABSOLUTELY ALSO HAVE TO TOUCH ON

02:14:08.273 --> 02:14:10.175
CAP AND TRADE WHICH I WON'T GO

02:14:10.242 --> 02:14:11.143
INTO AT LENGTH SINCE OUR LAST

WEEK- LAID OUT SOME OF THE

02:14:13.745 --> 02:14:14.846
ISSUES. THAT THEY'RE COMMITTEE

HAVE- OVERALL IT'S A PROGRAM

02:14:16.348 --> 02:14:17.716
THAT CONTINUES TO CONCENTRATE

02:14:17.783 --> 02:14:18.750
POLLUTION IN LOW INCOME

02:14:18.817 --> 02:14:20.318
COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF

02:14:20.385 --> 02:14:22.721

TO ADDRESS OUTSTANDING ISSUES.

02:14:31.863 --> 02:14:33.365
IT MUST BE ANALYZED FOR ITS

02:14:33.432 --> 02:14:34.666
OVERALL ROLE AND I WOULD

02:14:34.733 --> 02:14:37.169
ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK AT PAGES

02:14:37.235 --> 02:14:38.203
EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY OF THE E.

02:14:38.270 --> 02:14:39.571

THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE. SO AS

02:14:46.244 --> 02:14:48.213
I WRAP UP I DO ALSO WANT TO LIFT

INADEQUATE AND WE MUST ADDRESS

02:16:56.007 --> 02:16:57.576

FROM WONDERFUL AND REPORTER

02:17:36.881 --> 02:17:39.551
DISCUSSION- THE INITIAL DATA

02:17:39.618 --> 02:17:42.621
SUGGEST THAT. TWENTY TWENTY ONE

02:17:42.687 --> 02:17:45.190
IS. SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN TWENTY

02:17:45.256 --> 02:17:46.291
TWENTY OF COURSE WITH A PANDEMIC

02:17:46.358 --> 02:17:48.293
YOUR TERMS OF TOTAL EMISSIONS

02:17:48.360 --> 02:17:49.661
YEAH AND- BUT THE TWENTY TWENTY

02:17:49.728 --> 02:17:52.364
ONE IS ONLY ABOUT 2% LOWER THAN

02:17:52.430 --> 02:17:53.598
TWENTY NINETEEN IN SPITE OF THE

02:17:53.665 --> 02:17:56.067
ONGOING PANDEMIC SLOWDOWNS. SO

02:17:56.134 --> 02:17:57.402
WE'RE CERTAINLY GOING IN THE

02:17:57.469 --> 02:17:58.503
WRONG DIRECTION AT LEAST NOT

02:17:58.570 --> 02:18:00.338
FAST ENOUGH AND IN THE RIGHT

02:18:00.405 --> 02:18:02.807
DIRECTION AND- BEFORE TO WORK

02:18:02.874 --> 02:18:04.943
WITH ALL OF YOU AND HAD A WEEK

02:18:05.010 --> 02:18:07.479
EVERY CHANGE THAT TRAJECTORY.

02:18:07.545 --> 02:18:09.748
ONE QUESTION I HAD IS- IS ARE

02:18:09.814 --> 02:18:12.450
VERY AMBITIOUS ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT

02:18:12.517 --> 02:18:15.220
CARBON CAPTURE IN THIS DOCUMENT

02:18:15.286 --> 02:18:17.322
I'M SURE MADE RICHER RAN OFF

02:18:17.389 --> 02:18:19.424
WHAT OTHER POLICY ACTIONS WOULD

02:18:19.491 --> 02:18:23.228
BE REQUIRED TO HIT THE 203540%

02:18:23.295 --> 02:18:25.430
REDUCTION TARGET. IF THE

02:18:25.497 --> 02:18:27.532
ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT CARBON CAPTURE

02:18:27.599 --> 02:18:29.801
WERE NOT SO OPTIMISTIC- YOU KNOW

02:18:29.868 --> 02:18:31.069
HOW MUCH FOR THE REDUCTIONS IN

02:18:31.136 --> 02:18:33.805
TRANSPORTATION OR BUILDINGS

02:18:33.872 --> 02:18:35.607
WOULD HAVE TO BE DONE. M. I

02:18:35.674 --> 02:18:37.175
GUESS I I'LL HIGHLIGHT A FEW

02:18:37.242 --> 02:18:38.743
THINGS I MEAN FIRST OF ALL I

02:18:38.810 --> 02:18:41.880
THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT AND WE

02:18:41.946 --> 02:18:44.549
NEED TO TRANSFORM. MANY SECTORS

02:18:44.616 --> 02:18:47.419
OF OUR ECONOMY. WE NEED TO

02:18:47.485 --> 02:18:49.654
TRANSFORM TRANSPORTATION TO BE

02:18:49.721 --> 02:18:50.355
NEARLY COMPLETELY FREE OF

02:18:50.422 --> 02:18:53.224
PETROLEUM AS CALLED FOR IN THE

02:18:53.291 --> 02:18:54.693
GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER AND

02:18:54.759 --> 02:18:56.227
WITHOUT MAKING SIGNIFICANT

02:18:56.294 --> 02:18:59.164
PROGRESS ON THAT SECTOR- WE WILL

02:18:59.230 --> 02:19:02.367
NOT STAY ON TRACK SO THAT WE

02:19:02.434 --> 02:19:04.169
NEED TO DOUBLE DOWN OUR WORK

02:19:04.235 --> 02:19:08.873
THERE- WE ALSO KNOW THAT- YOU

02:19:08.940 --> 02:19:10.642
KNOW THE QUESTION OF WHETHER

02:19:10.709 --> 02:19:13.244
WE'RE ON TRACK ASSUMES. KIND OF

02:19:13.311 --> 02:19:15.880
A LINEAR PROGRESS YEAR TO YEAR-

02:19:15.947 --> 02:19:17.348
AND WE KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE THAT

02:19:17.415 --> 02:19:19.684
DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAPPEN. WE

02:19:19.751 --> 02:19:20.618
KNOW EMISSIONS WERE

02:19:20.685 --> 02:19:23.488
SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER- IN TWENTY

02:19:23.555 --> 02:19:25.423
TWENTY DUE TO THE PANDEMIC AND

02:19:25.490 --> 02:19:26.524
WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A

02:19:26.591 --> 02:19:28.727
BOUNCE BACK BUT WE HAVEN'T

02:19:28.793 --> 02:19:29.260
QUANTIFIED THE NUMBERS FOR

02:19:29.327 --> 02:19:32.397
EITHER OF THOSE YEARS- YOU KNOW

02:19:32.464 --> 02:19:34.632
WE HAVE PROVIDED SOME. ESTIMATES

02:19:34.699 --> 02:19:36.601
BUT WE'VE BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT

02:19:36.668 --> 02:19:37.769
THOSE ESTIMATES ARE NOT THE

02:19:37.836 --> 02:19:40.405
ACTUAL NUMBERS AND- AND ARE NOT

02:19:40.472 --> 02:19:42.440
MEANT TO BE USED TO KIND OF SET

02:19:42.507 --> 02:19:43.875
POLICY GOING FORWARD RECOGNIZING

02:19:43.942 --> 02:19:45.477
THAT THEY'RE NOT THE ACTUAL

02:19:45.543 --> 02:19:46.978
NUMBERS SO I THINK THAT'S REALLY

02:19:47.045 --> 02:19:50.682
IMPORTANT TO NOTE. I'M AND- AND

02:19:50.749 --> 02:19:52.684
WITH AS I MENTIONED IN MY PRISON

02:19:52.751 --> 02:19:54.652
TATIAN THERE ARE UNCERTAINTIES

02:19:54.719 --> 02:19:56.888
WITH ALL OF OUR STRATEGIES FOR

02:19:56.955 --> 02:19:58.623
INSTANCE REDUCING VEHICLE MILES

02:19:58.690 --> 02:20:01.526
TRAVELED IS A CRITICAL STRATEGY-

02:20:01.593 --> 02:20:02.660
AND YOU KNOW I WANT TO

02:20:02.727 --> 02:20:04.996
HIGHLIGHT. A LOT OF WHAT DOCTOR

02:20:05.063 --> 02:20:06.631
GROUP WHITE SAID ABOUT THE

02:20:06.698 --> 02:20:08.733
IMPORTANCE OF TRANSIT THE

02:20:08.800 --> 02:20:12.437
IMPORTANCE OF- ALTERNATIVE WAYS

02:20:12.504 --> 02:20:13.204
FOR GETTING AROUND THE

02:20:13.271 --> 02:20:15.840
IMPORTANCE OF. HOUSING A YOU

02:20:15.907 --> 02:20:17.342
KNOW HAVING A SUFFICIENT SUPPLY

02:20:17.408 --> 02:20:18.843
OF HOUSING IN THE STATE BUT

02:20:18.910 --> 02:20:20.445
HAVING THAT HOUSING LOCATED IN A

02:20:20.512 --> 02:20:22.814
WAY THAT ALLOWS WORKERS TO GET

02:20:22.881 --> 02:20:25.784
TO WORK WITHOUT HAVING TO- SPEND

02:20:25.850 --> 02:20:28.019
A LOT OF TIME ON THE ROAD. I'M

02:20:28.086 --> 02:20:30.121
ALL OF THOSE LAND USE DECISIONS

02:20:30.188 --> 02:20:33.224
DECISIONS ABOUT- MAKING

02:20:33.291 --> 02:20:34.759
COMMUNITIES MORE SUSTAINABLE ALL

02:20:34.826 --> 02:20:36.528
HAVING MORE ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF

02:20:36.594 --> 02:20:37.796
JEFF TRANSPORTATION THOSE ARE

02:20:37.862 --> 02:20:39.798
ALL CRITICAL POLICY GOALS THAT

02:20:39.864 --> 02:20:41.533
WILL GET US WHERE WE NEED TO GO

02:20:41.599 --> 02:20:43.101
AND IT'S AREAS WHERE WE KNOW

02:20:43.168 --> 02:20:45.403
WE'RE BEHIND. RIGHT SO IT'S NOT

02:20:45.470 --> 02:20:48.006
JUST THINKING ABOUT- YOU KNOW

02:20:48.072 --> 02:20:50.208
THE TECHNOLOGY PIECES IT'S

02:20:50.275 --> 02:20:51.676
THINKING OF ALL OF THE

02:20:51.743 --> 02:20:53.044
STRATEGIES IN THE SCOPING PLAN

02:20:53.111 --> 02:20:56.781
AND MAKING SURE THAT WE MAKE

02:20:56.848 --> 02:20:57.248
PROGRESS ON ALL OF THE

02:20:57.315 --> 02:20:59.017
STRATEGIES. SO THE SHORT ANSWER

02:20:59.083 --> 02:21:00.251
TO YOUR QUESTION I THINK IS IF

02:21:00.318 --> 02:21:01.686
WE SEE ANY OF OUR STRATEGIES

02:21:01.753 --> 02:21:04.022
FOLLOWING BEHIND WE NEED TO

02:21:04.088 --> 02:21:05.623
EXPLORE THEM UNDERSTAND WAYS WE

02:21:05.690 --> 02:21:07.392
CAN MAKE THEM MORE ROBUST AND

02:21:07.458 --> 02:21:09.861
STRONGER. AND ALSO LOOK AT

02:21:09.928 --> 02:21:11.629
OPPORTUNITIES TO LEAN INTO OTHER

02:21:11.696 --> 02:21:13.631
STRATEGIES TO MAKE SURE THAT.

02:21:13.698 --> 02:21:15.967
WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS ON ALL OF

02:21:16.034 --> 02:21:20.371
OUR GOALS. I'M ANY SOME

02:21:20.438 --> 02:21:22.040
ADVOCATES HAVE HAVE ARGUED THAT

02:21:22.106 --> 02:21:23.808
IS HERE FOR YOU OAK AWAY SAID

02:21:23.875 --> 02:21:27.178
SCENARIO- AND I WOULD AGREE.

02:21:27.245 --> 02:21:28.446
THAT THE WHAT ABOUT US IN THE

02:21:28.513 --> 02:21:30.215
CLOSER TO SCENARIO ONE IN TERMS

02:21:30.281 --> 02:21:32.784
OF AGGRESSIVE EARLY. ACTIONS TO

02:21:32.851 --> 02:21:34.118
START THE TRANSITION WHILE

02:21:34.185 --> 02:21:37.155
GIVING IT A LONGER RUNWAY. SAY

02:21:37.222 --> 02:21:38.890
TO TWENTY FORTY FIVE TO GET TO

02:21:38.957 --> 02:21:40.892
NET ZERO ME THAT WOULD REFLECT I

02:21:40.959 --> 02:21:42.160
THINK IT'S AN AREA BETWEEN.

02:21:42.227 --> 02:21:43.595
MAYBE SCENARIO ONE AND SCENARIO

02:21:43.661 --> 02:21:45.363
THREE WHICH BELIES. REALLY

02:21:45.430 --> 02:21:50.435
HEAVILY ON ON CARBON REMOVAL. SO

02:21:50.501 --> 02:21:55.306
AM I THINK AS- I'LL SAY A COUPLE

02:21:55.373 --> 02:21:57.542
THINGS I MEAN FIRST OF ALL I

02:21:57.609 --> 02:21:58.176
THINK ALL OF OUR SCENARIOS ARE

02:21:58.243 --> 02:22:00.778
INFORMED BY A LOT OF INPUT AND

02:22:00.845 --> 02:22:01.613
YOU KNOW SCENARIO FOR. OUR

02:22:01.679 --> 02:22:04.749
ALTERNATIVE FOR- AT YOU KNOW WAS

02:22:04.816 --> 02:22:07.652
INFORMED BY INPUT FROM- FROM

02:22:07.719 --> 02:22:12.991
STAKEHOLDERS- AND- AND I GUESS I

02:22:13.057 --> 02:22:15.326
WOULD ALSO ADD THAT. ANY OF

02:22:15.393 --> 02:22:18.963
THESE SCENARIOS WE CAN BE MORE

02:22:19.030 --> 02:22:20.198
AGGRESSIVE ON DIFFERENT

02:22:20.265 --> 02:22:20.932
STRATEGIES WITHIN THOSE

02:22:20.999 --> 02:22:25.370
SCENARIOS- SO AS WE AS WE PICK

02:22:25.436 --> 02:22:26.337
THE DIFFERENT SCENARIOS WE CAN

02:22:26.404 --> 02:22:28.106
ALSO HIGHLIGHT KIND OF EARLY

02:22:28.172 --> 02:22:29.507
ACTION AND YOU KNOW THIS WILL BE

02:22:29.574 --> 02:22:31.309
A KIND OF A REALLY IMPORTANT

02:22:31.376 --> 02:22:33.311
CONVERSATION THAT THE BOARD HAS

02:22:33.378 --> 02:22:36.814
WHEN IT- IS PRESENTED WITH THE

02:22:36.881 --> 02:22:37.615
SCENARIOS AND HAS THE

02:22:37.682 --> 02:22:40.551
OPPORTUNITY. TO LOOK AT YOU KNOW

02:22:40.618 --> 02:22:42.186
THE PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS THE

02:22:42.253 --> 02:22:45.089
COSTS THAT YOU KNOW THE OVERALL

02:22:45.156 --> 02:22:49.727
EFFECT ON GDP- EFFECT ON JOBS-

02:22:49.794 --> 02:22:52.063
AND THE BENEFITS OF EACH

02:22:52.130 --> 02:22:55.333
SCENARIO AND- LOOKING AT THE

02:22:55.400 --> 02:22:57.068
DIFFERENT. STRATEGIES WITHIN

02:22:57.135 --> 02:22:58.903
THEM AND HIGHLIGHTING YOU KNOW

02:22:58.970 --> 02:23:01.272
ARE THERE OPPORTUNITIES TO GO-

02:23:01.339 --> 02:23:03.207
FASTER WITH PARTICULAR STRATEGY

02:23:03.274 --> 02:23:05.209
SO THAT'LL ALL BE PART OF THE

02:23:05.276 --> 02:23:07.412
BOARD CONVERSATION IN JUNE OKAY

02:23:07.478 --> 02:23:08.746
YEAH WE JUST- TO CONSIDERATION

02:23:08.813 --> 02:23:10.381
OF THAT OF THAT THIS AGGRESSIVE

02:23:10.448 --> 02:23:12.650
ACTIONS IN SYRIA ONE. BUT GIVING

02:23:12.717 --> 02:23:15.453
IT MORE TIME FRAME- YEAH AND I

02:23:15.520 --> 02:23:18.456
AND I ALSO YOU KNOW. A LOT OF

02:23:18.523 --> 02:23:20.792
THE STRATEGIES LIKE FOR INSTANCE

02:23:20.858 --> 02:23:21.759
ONE OF THE KEY DIFFERENCES

02:23:21.826 --> 02:23:24.629
BETWEEN ALTERNATIVE ONE AND

02:23:24.696 --> 02:23:25.897
ALTERNATIVE THREE IS. OUR RATE

02:23:25.964 --> 02:23:28.066
OF ASSUMPTIONS ON OUR VEHICLE

02:23:28.132 --> 02:23:30.301
TRANSITIONS AND OUR RATE OF

02:23:30.368 --> 02:23:30.835
ASSUMPTIONS ON BUILDING

02:23:30.902 --> 02:23:33.371
DECARBONIZATION YOU KNOW AND CAN

02:23:33.438 --> 02:23:35.573
CAN THE RATE OF THOSE

02:23:35.640 --> 02:23:38.443
TRANSFORMATIONS. BE SPED UP AND

02:23:38.509 --> 02:23:40.845
YOU KNOW THE- THE INVESTMENTS

02:23:40.912 --> 02:23:43.014
THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS MADE IN

02:23:43.081 --> 02:23:44.349
THOSE AREAS AND LAST YEAR'S

02:23:44.415 --> 02:23:45.516
BUDGET AND HOPEFULLY THIS YEAR'S

02:23:45.583 --> 02:23:47.719
BUDGET I THINK WILL WILL HELP-

02:23:47.785 --> 02:23:49.654
IN OUR STATE IMPLEMENTATION

02:23:49.721 --> 02:23:53.191
STRATEGY FOR THE- SEVENTY PP BE

02:23:53.257 --> 02:23:55.259
OZONE STANDARD WHICH HAS TO BE

02:23:55.326 --> 02:23:56.461
MET BY TWENTY THIRTY SEVEN. YOU

02:23:56.527 --> 02:23:58.329
KNOW ONE OF THE STRATEGIES WERE

02:23:58.396 --> 02:24:00.798
THINKING ABOUT IN THAT PLAN IS

02:24:00.865 --> 02:24:01.766
YOU KNOW CAN WE MOVE- ARE DIESEL

02:24:01.833 --> 02:24:03.434
TRUCKS OFF THE ROAD WHEN THEY

02:24:03.501 --> 02:24:05.603
FINISH THEIR D. USEFUL LIFE LIKE

02:24:05.670 --> 02:24:06.971
WHAT ARE SOME STRATEGIES AROUND

02:24:07.038 --> 02:24:07.672
THAT ARE THEIR INCENTIVE

02:24:07.739 --> 02:24:09.140
STRATEGIES AROUND THAT ARE THERE

02:24:09.207 --> 02:24:11.476
REGULATORY STRATEGIES LIKE. WHAT

02:24:11.542 --> 02:24:13.911
ARE WAYS THAT WE CAN ACCELERATE-

02:24:13.978 --> 02:24:15.346
MOVING THOSE VEHICLES OFF THE

02:24:15.413 --> 02:24:17.382
ROAD SO THOSE ARE THE KIND OF

02:24:17.448 --> 02:24:18.649
THINGS THAT WE CAN THINK ABOUT

02:24:18.716 --> 02:24:21.986
REALLY- PUTTING THE PEDAL TO THE

02:24:22.053 --> 02:24:25.056
METAL AND MAKING. PROGRESS- IN

02:24:25.123 --> 02:24:27.992
MEETING THE GOALS. MAYBE ONE

02:24:28.059 --> 02:24:29.961
MORE THEY'LL GIVE TO MY

02:24:30.028 --> 02:24:30.528
COLLEAGUES WHO CAN TEACH IS

02:24:30.595 --> 02:24:33.164
QUESTION I AM THERE. IT LOOKS

02:24:33.231 --> 02:24:36.667
LIKE THERE. IN THE WAY. THAT

02:24:36.734 --> 02:24:38.169
COVERS INTERPRETING SB ONE

02:24:38.236 --> 02:24:40.238
HUNDRED- THEY'RE STILL

02:24:40.304 --> 02:24:42.407
CONSIDERABLE EMISSIONS COMING

02:24:42.473 --> 02:24:46.677
FROM ELECTRICITY EVEN IN A- IN

02:24:46.744 --> 02:24:48.813
IN ALL SCENARIOS WILL ACCEPT

02:24:48.880 --> 02:24:52.517
SCENARIO ONE- SO YOU KNOW 80%

02:24:52.583 --> 02:24:53.151
REDUCTION EMISSIONS MEANS ABOUT

02:24:53.217 --> 02:24:54.652
THE MEASURE OUT EIGHTY MILLION

02:24:54.719 --> 02:24:56.988
METRIC ONS- FOR THE WHOLE

02:24:57.055 --> 02:24:58.423
ECONOMY SO WE HAVE THIRTY

02:24:58.489 --> 02:25:00.191
MILLION METRIC TONS LEFT OVER

02:25:00.258 --> 02:25:01.959
FROM ELECTRICITY. W. A LARGE

02:25:02.026 --> 02:25:03.561
PART OF REMAINING EMISSIONS SO

02:25:03.628 --> 02:25:05.329
THIS WINDOW IS WE FEEL LIKE WE

02:25:05.396 --> 02:25:07.098
SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO MUCH BETTER

02:25:07.165 --> 02:25:08.833
THAN THAT I THINK THEY WERE

02:25:08.900 --> 02:25:10.301
EXPECTING TO GET TO THIRTY EIGHT

02:25:10.368 --> 02:25:11.369
MILLION METRIC TONS BY TWENTY

02:25:11.436 --> 02:25:13.104
THIRTY OF ELECTRICITY SECTOR

02:25:13.171 --> 02:25:15.173
FROM CORRECT- SO I WOULD JUST

02:25:15.239 --> 02:25:17.475
URGE BUT YOU KNOW AGAIN EXCEPT

02:25:17.542 --> 02:25:18.576
FOR DINNER WHILE THEY'RE STILL A

02:25:18.643 --> 02:25:21.712
LOT OF EMISSIONS WATCHERS THE

02:25:21.779 --> 02:25:22.880
SECTOR FEELS THAT WE SHOULD GO

02:25:22.947 --> 02:25:24.382
TO DRIVE OUT. SO THE ONE OF THE

02:25:24.449 --> 02:25:28.319
EIGHT. I AM WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:25:28.386 --> 02:25:30.054
THAT THIS IS ONE OF THOSE AREAS

02:25:30.121 --> 02:25:31.722
I THINK IT'S REALLY REALLY

02:25:31.789 --> 02:25:34.092
IMPORTANT- TO KNOW THAT.

02:25:34.158 --> 02:25:37.228
IMPLEMENTATION IS SO IMPORTANT.

02:25:37.295 --> 02:25:39.530
IN ORDER TO MEET OUR SB ONE

02:25:39.597 --> 02:25:41.365
HUNDRED GOALS THERE NEEDS TO BE

02:25:41.432 --> 02:25:43.267
SIGNIFICANT DEPLOYMENT OF

02:25:43.334 --> 02:25:45.603
RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES AND I

02:25:45.670 --> 02:25:47.105
JUST WANT TO. I WANT TO MAKE

02:25:47.171 --> 02:25:48.539
SURE THAT EVERYONE KNOWS YOU

02:25:48.606 --> 02:25:50.675
KNOW THOSE PROJECTS NEED TO. TO

02:25:50.741 --> 02:25:52.677
BE PERMITTED THEY NEED TO BE

02:25:52.743 --> 02:25:55.179
APPROVED THEY NEED TO BE. BUILT

02:25:55.246 --> 02:25:58.316
AND- AND WE NEED TO STAY ON THAT

02:25:58.382 --> 02:26:00.084
TRAJECTORY TO MAKE HUGE

02:26:00.151 --> 02:26:02.520
PROGRESS- IN THAT CLEAN ENERGY

02:26:02.587 --> 02:26:06.591
TRANSITION- AND- I NEVER MISS

02:26:06.657 --> 02:26:08.259
HAPPEN OP. I HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY

02:26:08.326 --> 02:26:09.794
TO KIND OF MAKE THAT EDITORIAL

02:26:09.861 --> 02:26:11.596
COMMENT THAT WE HAVE TO WE HAVE

02:26:11.662 --> 02:26:13.764
TO DEPLOY DEPLOY DEPLOY- AND

02:26:13.831 --> 02:26:15.399
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE- A

02:26:15.466 --> 02:26:17.468
LOT OF THOSE DECISIONS ARE.

02:26:17.535 --> 02:26:19.670
LOCAL DECISIONS AND WE NEED TO

02:26:19.737 --> 02:26:22.106
MAKE SURE THAT THEY- CONTINUE TO

02:26:22.173 --> 02:26:25.943
HAPPEN SO THAT WE ARE GETTING.

02:26:26.010 --> 02:26:27.111
THE STEEL IN THE GROUND THAT.

02:26:27.178 --> 02:26:29.213
GREENS OUR ECONOMY AND CREATE

02:26:29.280 --> 02:26:32.116
JOBS. AGREED VERY MUCH THANK YOU

02:26:32.183 --> 02:26:33.885
THANK YOUR COMMENTS THANK YOU

02:26:33.951 --> 02:26:37.788
VERY MUCH SARAH STERN. THANK

02:26:37.855 --> 02:26:40.525
YOU- TWENTY MAKE UP A

02:26:40.591 --> 02:26:42.627
ABBREVIATED COMMENT AND-

02:26:42.693 --> 02:26:45.763
ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH THE VICE

02:26:45.830 --> 02:26:50.168
CHAIRS- URGINGS OF CONSIDERATION

02:26:50.234 --> 02:26:52.203
ON THAT AGGRESSIVENESS I'M IN

02:26:52.270 --> 02:26:55.339
THE NEAR TERM. AND NOT GETTING

02:26:55.406 --> 02:26:58.242
STUCK IN IN THE IMPASSE THAT YOU

02:26:58.309 --> 02:27:01.979
KNOW WE HAVE TO JUST WAIT ON.

02:27:02.046 --> 02:27:03.481
OTHER AGENCIES OR OTHER

02:27:03.548 --> 02:27:05.550
TECHNOLOGIES FOR MERGING BUT I'M

02:27:05.616 --> 02:27:07.652
I'M REALLY PLEASED TO HEAR YOU

02:27:07.718 --> 02:27:11.155
OCCUPY THAT ROLE AS CHAIR OF THE

02:27:11.222 --> 02:27:13.391
LEAD AIR POLLUTION REGULATOR AND

02:27:13.457 --> 02:27:16.127
USING THOSE A FORTIES THAT YOU

02:27:16.194 --> 02:27:19.564
HAVE- UNDER SB THIRTY TWO IN

02:27:19.630 --> 02:27:22.733
ANOTHER AREAS OF LAW. BUT ALSO

02:27:22.800 --> 02:27:24.835
YOU KNOW AT THE OUTSET. WHEN YOU

02:27:24.902 --> 02:27:26.337
TALK ABOUT THE AVOIDED AIR

02:27:26.404 --> 02:27:29.240
QUALITY RELATED DEATHS THAT WERE

02:27:29.307 --> 02:27:30.675
AVOIDING IN THE STATE BECAUSE OF

02:27:30.741 --> 02:27:32.109
OUR PROGRESS AND CONTINUING TO

02:27:32.176 --> 02:27:33.611
ROUTE THIS WORK IN PUBLIC HEALTH

02:27:33.678 --> 02:27:35.346
I THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE WE

02:27:35.413 --> 02:27:36.914
CAN DO ON THE REGULATORY SIDE

02:27:36.981 --> 02:27:38.082
FOR DIRECT EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS

02:27:38.149 --> 02:27:40.117
RIGHT NOW. I THINK THAT HAS TO

02:27:40.184 --> 02:27:42.220
DO WITH OUR HOW WE ACHIEVE OUR

02:27:42.286 --> 02:27:44.255
SIP. I THINK THAT HAS TO DO WITH

02:27:44.322 --> 02:27:45.690
HOW MOBILE SOURCE RULES- ARE

02:27:45.756 --> 02:27:47.725
ROLLED OUT AND I WOULD APPLAUD

02:27:47.792 --> 02:27:50.127
YOU FOR WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING

02:27:50.194 --> 02:27:52.363
ON THE LIGHT DUTY FRONT I THINK

02:27:52.430 --> 02:27:54.465
WE CAN DO EVEN MORE. I MEAN ANY

02:27:54.532 --> 02:27:56.167
MORE LIGHT DUTY I KNOW IT'S JUST

02:27:56.234 --> 02:27:58.769
A ADDITIONAL PROPOSAL BUT- I

02:27:58.836 --> 02:28:00.071
THINK WE CAN BE BOLDER AND I

02:28:00.137 --> 02:28:01.505
THINK IN THE LEGISLATURE WE NEED

02:28:01.572 --> 02:28:03.975
TO GIVE YOU SPACE TO BE THAT

02:28:04.041 --> 02:28:06.010
BOLD AND LET YOU KNOW THAT WERE

02:28:06.077 --> 02:28:08.679
WITH YOU- AND- AND THE SAME GOES

02:28:08.746 --> 02:28:10.781
ON. ON ALL THESEOTHER SECTORS

02:28:10.848 --> 02:28:13.584
ON THE POWER FRONT ON THE

02:28:13.651 --> 02:28:15.987
INDUSTRIAL FRONT- YOU KNOW. THE

02:28:16.053 --> 02:28:17.822
MARKETS NOT GONNA SOLVE THIS

02:28:17.888 --> 02:28:18.623
WHOLE PROBLEM. AND I THINK

02:28:18.689 --> 02:28:19.957
THAT'S THE REALIZATION IS THAT

02:28:20.024 --> 02:28:21.826
CABIN TRAITS NOT GONNA SOLVE.

02:28:21.892 --> 02:28:24.662
THIS CRISIS AND- M. IT'S GOING

02:28:24.729 --> 02:28:26.330
TO BE THERE- AND I DO THINK

02:28:26.397 --> 02:28:27.832
WE'RE GONNA NEED THOSE MARKET

02:28:27.898 --> 02:28:29.900
MECHANISMS BUT I'M I'M I'M JUST

02:28:29.967 --> 02:28:31.302
. I'M I'M HEARTENED TO HEAR YOU

02:28:31.369 --> 02:28:33.838
FOCUS ON THE DETAILS OF THE

02:28:33.904 --> 02:28:34.972
SECTORAL SORT OF DIRECT

02:28:35.039 --> 02:28:38.242
EMISSIONS APPROACHES. AND NOT

02:28:38.309 --> 02:28:40.111
ALSO JUST BETTING ON UNTESTED

02:28:40.177 --> 02:28:41.145
TECHNOLOGIES WAY TO GET US

02:28:41.212 --> 02:28:43.581
THERE. BECAUSE WE ARE GONNA HAVE

02:28:43.648 --> 02:28:44.715
TO LOOK AT THE CARBON REMOVAL

02:28:44.782 --> 02:28:47.485
QUESTION. AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE

02:28:47.551 --> 02:28:49.420
TO LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE

02:28:49.487 --> 02:28:52.823
TECHNOLOGY SCENARIOS. WORKED IN

02:28:52.890 --> 02:28:55.259
CARBON REMOVAL THROUGHOUT MY

02:28:55.326 --> 02:28:57.628
CAREER AND YOU KNOW WATCHING

02:28:57.695 --> 02:28:59.964
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE OBAMA

02:29:00.031 --> 02:29:01.499
ADMINISTRATION. AROUND THAT

02:29:01.565 --> 02:29:03.401
GREAT PROMISE OF CARBON CAPTURE.

02:29:03.467 --> 02:29:06.671
AND YOU KNOW EIGHT BILLION

02:29:06.737 --> 02:29:08.906
DOLLARS LATER ON FUTURE CHEN YOU

02:29:08.973 --> 02:29:10.708
HAVE A HAWKING MASS SITTING IN

02:29:10.775 --> 02:29:12.143
THE MIDDLE OF THIS COUNTRY THAT

02:29:12.209 --> 02:29:13.411
ISN'T DOING ANYTHING IS

02:29:13.477 --> 02:29:15.913
COMPLETELY DISMANTLE. AND SO I

02:29:15.980 --> 02:29:17.415
KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF ENERGY AND

02:29:17.481 --> 02:29:19.950
ENTHUSIASM ABOUT EXCITING NEW

02:29:20.017 --> 02:29:21.752
TECHNOLOGY IDEAS BUILDING

02:29:21.819 --> 02:29:23.220
ELECTROLYZER IS FOR HYDROGEN

02:29:23.287 --> 02:29:26.057
AND- GOING BIG ON. YOU KNOW

02:29:26.123 --> 02:29:28.559
CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE IN IN

02:29:28.626 --> 02:29:31.162
INTO INDUSTRIAL AND EVEN INTO

02:29:31.228 --> 02:29:33.931
THE OIL SECTOR BUT I. WE HAVE A

02:29:33.998 --> 02:29:35.700
STE APPROACH A SERIES OF

02:29:35.766 --> 02:29:37.668
PROGRAMS THAT ARE WORKING. AND

02:29:37.735 --> 02:29:39.136
THEY'RE LITERALLY TRANSFORMING

02:29:39.203 --> 02:29:40.504
THE ENTIRE GLOBAL MARKET JUST

02:29:40.571 --> 02:29:43.507
FROM DOING THE BASIC STICKING OF

02:29:43.574 --> 02:29:45.443
THOSE FUNDAMENTALS CLEAN AIR.

02:29:45.509 --> 02:29:47.411
OUR STANDARDS NO ALL THE SPACE

02:29:47.478 --> 02:29:49.847
THAT WE WERE JUST GIVEN FROM THE

02:29:49.914 --> 02:29:51.182
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION THAT TO ME

02:29:51.248 --> 02:29:53.384
IS A SIGNAL THAT CALIFORNIA IS

02:29:53.451 --> 02:29:55.720
PUT IN. UNFORTUNATELY THE

02:29:55.786 --> 02:29:56.654
SITUATION WHERE THE WHOLE

02:29:56.721 --> 02:29:58.522
COUNTRY'S GOING TO COUNT ON US

02:29:58.589 --> 02:30:00.324
TO KEEP LEADING. AND WE HAVEN'T

02:30:00.391 --> 02:30:03.661
SEEN. AT LEAST FROM A FROM A

02:30:03.728 --> 02:30:04.729
REGULATORY OR LEGISLATIVE

02:30:04.795 --> 02:30:07.231
PERSPECTIVE CONGRESS BE ABLE TO

02:30:07.298 --> 02:30:11.068
ACT BUT- BUT I DON'T JUST WANT

02:30:11.135 --> 02:30:12.636
TO CHASE. YOU KNOW TAX CREDITS

02:30:12.703 --> 02:30:14.071
OR SORT OF NEAR TERM BUDGET

02:30:14.138 --> 02:30:16.474
OPPORTUNITIES AND LET THAT DRIVE

02:30:16.540 --> 02:30:18.476
OUR POLICY. I THINK WE'VE GOT TO

02:30:18.542 --> 02:30:19.610
STICK TO DOING THIS THE

02:30:19.677 --> 02:30:22.313
CALIFORNIA WAY AND- AND I THINK

02:30:22.380 --> 02:30:24.215
THAT MEANS JUSTICE IN JOBS

02:30:24.281 --> 02:30:26.050
FIRST. AND I THINK WE CAN GET

02:30:26.117 --> 02:30:27.585
THAT DONE SO I APPRECIATE THE

02:30:27.651 --> 02:30:30.020
HEARING TODAY AND LET HIM LET ME

02:30:30.087 --> 02:30:31.322
MAKE A FEW REMARKS THANK YOU

02:30:31.389 --> 02:30:33.357
MADAM CHAIR. THERE IS IF YOU

02:30:33.424 --> 02:30:35.626
HAVE A- FEW MINUTES I THE NEXT

02:30:35.693 --> 02:30:36.961
QUESTION. I KNOW THAT THERE'S

02:30:37.027 --> 02:30:38.863
GOING TO BE SOME IMPORTANT.

02:30:38.929 --> 02:30:40.331
CARBON CAPTURE BILLS COMING TO

02:30:40.398 --> 02:30:42.666
YOUR YOUR COMMITTEE. YEAH IF I

02:30:42.733 --> 02:30:47.271
CAN- JUST JUMP RIGHT IN AND ASK

02:30:47.338 --> 02:30:49.874
A QUESTION DIRECTLY RELEVANT O

02:30:49.940 --> 02:30:53.444
ADD TO. THIS TOPIC SO I CHAIR

02:30:53.511 --> 02:30:57.381
RANDOLPH- AS A DOCTOR GROUP

02:30:57.448 --> 02:30:59.950
WHITE- REFER TO IT IT APPEARS

02:31:00.017 --> 02:31:01.685
THAT CARP IS ASSUMING THAT

02:31:01.752 --> 02:31:03.087
CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE

02:31:03.154 --> 02:31:06.557
TECHNOLOGY HAS A CAPTURE RATE OF

02:31:06.624 --> 02:31:10.294
90% AND YET- COURTING TO.

02:31:10.361 --> 02:31:11.529
BACKGROUND INFORMATION THAT WAS

02:31:11.595 --> 02:31:13.097
PROVIDED TO THIS COMMITTEE THERE

02:31:13.164 --> 02:31:14.598
THERE ARE TWO SPECIFIC PROJECTS

02:31:14.665 --> 02:31:16.667
FOR EXAMPLETHE PETRA NOTEBOOK

02:31:16.734 --> 02:31:17.668
CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE

02:31:17.735 --> 02:31:19.570
PROJECT IN THE STATE OF

02:31:19.637 --> 02:31:20.504
WASHINGTON ONE OF THE LARGEST

02:31:20.571 --> 02:31:22.606
CCS PLANTS IN THE WORLD REPORTED

02:31:22.673 --> 02:31:27.211
A 33% CAPTURE RATE. AND ANOTHER

02:31:27.278 --> 02:31:28.212
PROJECT THIS SHIP THE SHELL

02:31:28.279 --> 02:31:30.147
QUEST CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE

02:31:30.214 --> 02:31:32.149
PROJECT IN CANADA REPORTED ONLY

02:31:32.216 --> 02:31:35.286
CAPTURING 48% SO HOW IS IT THAT

02:31:35.352 --> 02:31:37.621
THAT CARP CAN ASSUME A CAPTURE

02:31:37.688 --> 02:31:40.291
RATE OF 90% AS PART AS PART OF

02:31:40.357 --> 02:31:45.196
ITS-IT'S A- SCOPING PLAN.

02:31:45.262 --> 02:31:49.400
DELIBERATIONS SO IT D. M. WE

02:31:49.467 --> 02:31:52.970
HAVE. LITERATURE ANALYSIS THAT

02:31:53.037 --> 02:31:54.572
WILL BE YOU KNOW PRESENTED IN

02:31:54.638 --> 02:31:55.639
THE DRAFT SCOPING PLAN THAT

02:31:55.706 --> 02:31:57.675
TALKS ABOUT THE DIFFERENT A

02:31:57.741 --> 02:31:58.809
POTENTIAL RATES OF CARBON

02:31:58.876 --> 02:32:01.712
CAPTURE- AND IT CAN BE AS HIGH

02:32:01.779 --> 02:32:04.615
AS NINETY PERCENT- BUT I THINK

02:32:04.682 --> 02:32:07.117
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE- ITO SORT

02:32:07.184 --> 02:32:08.352
OF WE WERE TALKING EARLIER

02:32:08.419 --> 02:32:11.755
ABOUT- UNIT YOU IDENTIFY A

02:32:11.822 --> 02:32:13.858
STRATEGY. YOU IDENTIFY THE

02:32:13.924 --> 02:32:15.459
UNCERTAINTIES WITH THAT STRATEGY

02:32:15.526 --> 02:32:17.027
RATELIKE WE ALREADY KNOW AT

02:32:17.094 --> 02:32:19.997
THIS POINT THAT- IT'S SORT OF

02:32:20.064 --> 02:32:22.533
THE DEPLOYMENT OF CCS PROJECTS

02:32:22.600 --> 02:32:24.368
IS PROBABLY NOT GOING TO B. AS

02:32:24.435 --> 02:32:25.936
QUICKLY AS OUR INITIAL MODELING

02:32:26.003 --> 02:32:26.971
IS ASSUMING AND WILL PROBABLY

02:32:27.037 --> 02:32:30.608
HAVE TO ADJUST THAT- AND- AND

02:32:30.674 --> 02:32:32.376
THEN WE MAY NEED TO WOULD MAKE

02:32:32.443 --> 02:32:33.410
ADJUSTMENTS AS WE LEARN MORE

02:32:33.477 --> 02:32:35.379
ABOUT WHAT THE ACTUAL RATE OF

02:32:35.446 --> 02:32:39.583
CAPTURE IS- SO. WE WILL BE YOU

02:32:39.650 --> 02:32:41.552
KNOW LOOKING AT ALL OF THOSE

02:32:41.619 --> 02:32:42.353
ISSUES AS PART OF THE DISCUSSION

02:32:42.419 --> 02:32:44.421
AROUND THE DRAFT- AND WE WILL

02:32:44.488 --> 02:32:46.423
ABSOLUTELY BE SHARING OF DATA

02:32:46.490 --> 02:32:48.092
THAT FOLKS CAN KIND OF. PICK

02:32:48.158 --> 02:32:50.261
APART AND TAKE A LOOK AT ADD TO

02:32:50.327 --> 02:32:52.663
AND COMMENT ON AS PART OF THE

02:32:52.730 --> 02:32:54.365
PROCESS MMHM. OKAY I GUESS THE

02:32:54.431 --> 02:32:56.901
CONCERN THAT WE IN THE

02:32:56.967 --> 02:32:59.336
LEGISLATURE- FACING NOW IS THAT.

02:32:59.403 --> 02:33:00.571
MANY WHERE WHERE WE'RE HEARING

02:33:00.638 --> 02:33:05.075
FROM. FROM FROM THE OIL INDUSTRY

02:33:05.142 --> 02:33:08.112
FROM FROM THE- THE- THE BUILDING

02:33:08.178 --> 02:33:09.980
ENTREES THAT REPRESENT- THE

02:33:10.047 --> 02:33:12.149
FOSSIL FUEL WORKERS THAT THAT WE

02:33:12.216 --> 02:33:13.817
DON'T HAVE TO. PHASE OUT ANY

02:33:13.884 --> 02:33:16.320
FOSSIL FUELS BECAUSE CARBON

02:33:16.387 --> 02:33:17.721
CAPTURE AND STORAGE IS JUST

02:33:17.788 --> 02:33:19.256
GOING TO CAPTURE MAGICALLY

02:33:19.323 --> 02:33:21.725
CAPTURE ALL THE CARBON AND WE

02:33:21.792 --> 02:33:24.094
CAN CONTINUE TO DRILL AND RELY

02:33:24.161 --> 02:33:28.365
ON FOSSIL FUELS. AND SO. YOU

02:33:28.432 --> 02:33:29.600
KNOW WHAT I MEAN YOU TALKED

02:33:29.667 --> 02:33:31.569
ABOUT THE HOW YOU YOU DON'T MISS

02:33:31.635 --> 02:33:32.870
AN OPPORTUNITY TO STRESS THE

02:33:32.937 --> 02:33:34.838
URGENCY OF DEPLOYING AND

02:33:34.905 --> 02:33:36.407
PERMITTING RENEWABLE PROJECTS AS

02:33:36.473 --> 02:33:38.042
SOON AS POSSIBLE. I MEAN UNDER

02:33:38.108 --> 02:33:40.511
ANY SCENARIO THAT THAT THE A. R.

02:33:40.578 --> 02:33:43.147
B. IS A CONSIDERING NOW DO DO

02:33:43.213 --> 02:33:45.182
YOU DO YOU SEE ANY SCENARIO

02:33:45.249 --> 02:33:46.317
WHERE WE CAN REALISTICALLY

02:33:46.383 --> 02:33:48.319
ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY BY

02:33:48.385 --> 02:33:49.219
BEFORE TWENTY FORTY FIVE.

02:33:49.286 --> 02:33:51.789
WITHOUT SIGNIFICANTLY FOCUSING

02:33:51.855 --> 02:33:54.858
ON PHASING OUT OUR RELIANCE ON

02:33:54.925 --> 02:33:57.394
FOSSIL FUELS- 1100% I MEAN WE

02:33:57.461 --> 02:33:59.797
ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO PHASE OUT

02:33:59.863 --> 02:34:02.299
FOSSIL FUEL. COMBUSTION IN THE

02:34:02.366 --> 02:34:04.134
STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO MEET OUR

02:34:04.201 --> 02:34:06.604
GOALS AND THAT IS. YOU KNOW THE

02:34:06.670 --> 02:34:09.039
PRIMARY GOAL OF MANY OF THE

02:34:09.106 --> 02:34:10.941
PIECES OF OUR PORTFOLIO. BUT

02:34:11.008 --> 02:34:12.710
EVEN IF WE DO THAT EVEN IF WE

02:34:12.776 --> 02:34:14.945
ARE SUCCESSFUL IN THAT WE STILL

02:34:15.012 --> 02:34:17.147
HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

02:34:17.214 --> 02:34:18.482
INTERNAL COMBUSTION VEHICLES ON

02:34:18.549 --> 02:34:20.184
THE ROAD. WE HAVE EXISTING

02:34:20.250 --> 02:34:22.286
BUILDING SO THAT ALL ARE SET UP

02:34:22.353 --> 02:34:24.355
TO USE FOSSIL FUELS WE HAVE

02:34:24.421 --> 02:34:26.624
INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES WHERE WE

02:34:26.690 --> 02:34:29.627
HAVE NOT YET IDENTIFIED. A ZERO

02:34:29.693 --> 02:34:31.595
CARBON ALTERNATIVE FOR HOW THEY

02:34:31.662 --> 02:34:34.898
OPERATE- AND SO IT'S A THOSE

02:34:34.965 --> 02:34:36.533
EMISSIONS THAT WE REALLY NEED TO

02:34:36.600 --> 02:34:39.770
BE THINKING ABOUT. HOW CAN WE-

02:34:39.837 --> 02:34:41.238
CAPTURE THOSE EMISSIONS AT THE

02:34:41.305 --> 02:34:43.007
SOURCE AND HOW COULD WE DO

02:34:43.073 --> 02:34:44.508
DIRECT AIR CAPTURE AND WHAT ARE

02:34:44.575 --> 02:34:47.778
THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE AS A

02:34:47.845 --> 02:34:49.246
STATE CAN SUPPORT AND DEPLOY.

02:34:49.313 --> 02:34:51.382
ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. ANY SO IN

02:34:51.448 --> 02:35:00.691
OUR BASE. MY ON OKAY- THESE

02:35:00.758 --> 02:35:02.526
THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE ALWAYS

02:35:02.593 --> 02:35:07.097
FASCINATING TO ME BECAUSE- IN WE

02:35:07.164 --> 02:35:09.233
THROW AROUND TERMS LIKE JUSTICE

02:35:09.299 --> 02:35:11.201
ANY THROW AROUND TERMS LIKE-

02:35:11.268 --> 02:35:16.040
LIKE EQUITY- AND SO. WE DON'T

02:35:16.106 --> 02:35:18.742
KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL COSTS ARE-

02:35:18.809 --> 02:35:20.577
THE ONE QUESTION THAT I'D LOVE

02:35:20.644 --> 02:35:23.080
TO BE ABLE TO ASK YOU ABOUT ALL

02:35:23.147 --> 02:35:23.747
THESE DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES IS-

02:35:23.814 --> 02:35:25.582
WHAT WHAT'S THE ECONOMIC

02:35:25.649 --> 02:35:27.885
ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT THAT IT

02:35:27.951 --> 02:35:29.920
WILL HAVE ON OUR GDP IN IN

02:35:29.987 --> 02:35:31.522
CALIFORNIA BETWEEN EACH OF THE

02:35:31.588 --> 02:35:33.390
ALTERNATIVES BECAUSE THERE IS

02:35:33.457 --> 02:35:35.426
GOING TO BE. TO BE A COST AND

02:35:35.492 --> 02:35:37.294
THEN THE OTHER PART OF THIS THAT

02:35:37.361 --> 02:35:40.364
I'M ALWAYS VERY FASCINATED- A BY

02:35:40.431 --> 02:35:42.466
IS A WHAT THE REST OF THE WORLD

02:35:42.533 --> 02:35:45.803
THINKS AS WELL- I MIGHT BEEN ON

02:35:45.869 --> 02:35:47.204
RECORD- AS YOU DELVE I STILL GOT

02:35:47.271 --> 02:35:51.375
SCARS I'M OVER. CAP AND TRADE-

02:35:51.442 --> 02:35:54.778
THAT RUN PRETTY DEEP- AND I FELT

02:35:54.845 --> 02:35:56.480
AT THE TIME WAS THE RIGHT THING

02:35:56.547 --> 02:35:57.548
TO DO BECAUSE CALIFORNIA DOES

02:35:57.614 --> 02:36:01.018
HAVE TO LEAD WE NEED. TO GET TO

02:36:01.085 --> 02:36:03.253
A PLACE BUT NOT JUST IN

02:36:03.320 --> 02:36:04.755
CALIFORNIA BUT THE REST THE

02:36:04.822 --> 02:36:05.556
WORLD OR WE STOP PULLING CARBON

02:36:05.622 --> 02:36:07.391
OUT OF THE DIRT- AND PUTTING IN

02:36:07.458 --> 02:36:09.359
THE ATMOSPHERE AT SOME POINT WE

02:36:09.426 --> 02:36:11.061
HAVE TO GET IT OUT OF THE

02:36:11.128 --> 02:36:11.662
ATMOSPHERE AT ATMOSPHERE. AND

02:36:11.729 --> 02:36:13.597
PUTTING IT BACK INTO BACK INTO

02:36:13.664 --> 02:36:14.965
THE GROUND THAT'S THAT'S

02:36:15.032 --> 02:36:15.866
ABSOLUTELYTRUE WE'VE GOT TO

02:36:15.933 --> 02:36:17.968
WE'VE GOT TO DO THAT. BUT THE

02:36:18.035 --> 02:36:20.170
QUESTION IS HOW DO WE DO THAT

02:36:20.237 --> 02:36:22.539
WITHOUT RUINING OUR ECONOMY. AND

02:36:22.606 --> 02:36:24.508
IT'S FASCINATING ONE WHEN YOU

02:36:24.575 --> 02:36:26.410
BRING THIS UP- BECAUSE PEOPLE

02:36:26.477 --> 02:36:28.512
SAY ALL THERE YOU GO AGAIN CHAD

02:36:28.579 --> 02:36:30.347
YOU KNOW- YOU MUST BE THERE'S

02:36:30.414 --> 02:36:31.648
YOUR CONSERVATIVE SIDE COMING

02:36:31.715 --> 02:36:32.816
OUT AGAIN WHERE YOU'RE TALKING

02:36:32.883 --> 02:36:34.451
ABOUT. TALKING ABOUT THE ECONOMY

02:36:34.518 --> 02:36:36.386
WELL YOU KNOW MOM SAID- BACK

02:36:36.453 --> 02:36:38.222
WHEN I WAS A KID THAT MONEY

02:36:38.288 --> 02:36:40.357
DOESN'T GROW ON TREES- AND THAT

02:36:40.424 --> 02:36:42.426
WAS TRUE THEN AND IT IS STILL.

02:36:42.493 --> 02:36:45.395
TRUE TODAY AND WE HAVE TO HAVE

02:36:45.462 --> 02:36:46.897
THE CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT IT'S

02:36:46.964 --> 02:36:49.166
GOING TO COST. WHERE CALIFORNIA

02:36:49.233 --> 02:36:51.135
IS GOING TO LEAD NOT JUST IN THE

02:36:51.201 --> 02:36:52.703
U. S. THE IMPACT BECAUSE YOU'RE

02:36:52.770 --> 02:36:54.738
RIGHT THE REST OF THE COUNTRY IS

02:36:54.805 --> 02:36:56.440
WATCHING US. THE END THEY'RE

02:36:56.507 --> 02:36:58.041
WATCHING TO SEE WHAT IMPACT-

02:36:58.108 --> 02:37:00.077
THIS IS ALL GOING TO HAVE HERE.

02:37:00.144 --> 02:37:02.546
BEFORE THE BEFORE BUT NATIONALLY

02:37:02.613 --> 02:37:04.248
WE'RE GOING TO ACT. AND IT'S

02:37:04.314 --> 02:37:05.649
ALSO FASCINATING ESPECIALLY

02:37:05.716 --> 02:37:07.184
RIGHT NOW WHEN I WATCH EVERY

02:37:07.251 --> 02:37:09.052
SINGLE DAY. IN THE NEWS ABOUT

02:37:09.119 --> 02:37:11.388
WHAT'S HAPPENING OVER IN EUROPE.

02:37:11.455 --> 02:37:13.090
AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE

02:37:13.157 --> 02:37:16.026
ARE- I'LL CALL THEM DICTATORS

02:37:16.093 --> 02:37:18.428
BRUTAL DICTATORS- THAT ARE A

02:37:18.495 --> 02:37:20.697
POUNCING ON COUNTRIES RIGHT NEXT

02:37:20.764 --> 02:37:24.668
TO THEM- OVER. OIL AND- AND

02:37:24.735 --> 02:37:26.170
THAT'S WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT

02:37:26.236 --> 02:37:28.138
IT'S ABOUT OIL AND GAS I'M

02:37:28.205 --> 02:37:29.873
SEEING THE REST OF EUROPE. AND

02:37:29.940 --> 02:37:31.141
WHO SAID THAT THEY'RE GONNA MOVE

02:37:31.208 --> 02:37:32.876
A TO HAVE A SUSTAINABLE ENERGY

02:37:32.943 --> 02:37:34.678
PORTFOLIO. ON WHERE THEY'RE

02:37:34.745 --> 02:37:36.814
STILL A BOOK OF NOT WILLING TO

02:37:36.880 --> 02:37:38.382
STEP UP. YOU TALK ABOUT MORE

02:37:38.448 --> 02:37:41.084
JUSTICE AND TALK ABOUT MORALITY-

02:37:41.151 --> 02:37:42.686
STILL NOT WILLING TO BUILD A

02:37:42.753 --> 02:37:44.288
PULL THE PLUG ON THEIR- OIL AND

02:37:44.354 --> 02:37:46.056
GAS BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIC

02:37:46.123 --> 02:37:47.457
IMPACT OF THAT IT'S GOING TO

02:37:47.524 --> 02:37:49.193
HAVE BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT

02:37:49.259 --> 02:37:50.294
IT'S GOING TO HAVE. AN IMPACT ON

02:37:50.360 --> 02:37:51.762
THEIR ON IN DECREASING THEIR

02:37:51.829 --> 02:37:53.230
THEIR GDP SO WE HAVE TO BE

02:37:53.297 --> 02:37:55.065
THINKING ABOUT THIS. A FROM A

02:37:55.132 --> 02:37:57.801
FROM ECONOMIC. TERM I IN

02:37:57.868 --> 02:37:59.903
ECONOMIC TERMS AS WELL. AS OF

02:37:59.970 --> 02:38:01.371
THE ONE THING IN THE DOCUMENTS

02:38:01.438 --> 02:38:03.373
THAT I HAVE I DON'T HAVE- YOU

02:38:03.440 --> 02:38:05.008
KNOW WITH ALL THE FOR

02:38:05.075 --> 02:38:06.543
ALTERNATIVES- WHAT ARE THE

02:38:06.610 --> 02:38:08.645
IMPACT OF THIS IS GOING TO HAVE.

02:38:08.712 --> 02:38:10.447
IS IT GOING TO HAVE NEGATIVE

02:38:10.514 --> 02:38:11.481
IMPACT ON OUR- ON CALIFORNIA'S

02:38:11.548 --> 02:38:13.317
GDP- IS IT GOING TO BE A NET

02:38:13.383 --> 02:38:15.485
POSITIVE- AND HOW DO WE GET

02:38:15.552 --> 02:38:18.288
THEM. TO OUR GOALS A REDUCING

02:38:18.355 --> 02:38:20.157
OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT AT THE SAME

02:38:20.224 --> 02:38:24.127
TIME MAKING SURE. THAT WE HAVE A

02:38:24.194 --> 02:38:26.597
SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY. BUT SO THAT

02:38:26.663 --> 02:38:28.398
IS THE KEY YOU KNOW SOME OF THE

02:38:28.465 --> 02:38:30.267
KEY ISSUES THAT THE BOARD WILL

02:38:30.334 --> 02:38:32.436
NEED TO CONSIDER WHEN IT REVIEWS

02:38:32.502 --> 02:38:33.070
THE DRAFT PLAN IN JUNE BECAUSE

02:38:33.136 --> 02:38:35.739
EACH OF THESE ALTERNATIVES. HAS

02:38:35.806 --> 02:38:38.742
HAS PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS AND-

02:38:38.809 --> 02:38:41.879
AND COSTS BUT THEY SHOW. YOU TO

02:38:41.945 --> 02:38:43.113
THE ALTERNATIVE SHOWS A GROWING

02:38:43.180 --> 02:38:45.082
ECONOMY AND WE CAN CONSISTENTLY

02:38:45.148 --> 02:38:46.884
HAVE A GROWING ECONOMY AND THEN

02:38:46.950 --> 02:38:49.353
THE QUESTION IS JUST SORT OF-

02:38:49.419 --> 02:38:54.124
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH- OF- YOU KNOW.

02:38:54.191 --> 02:38:56.760
HOW MUCH WILL THE ECONOMIC.

02:38:56.827 --> 02:38:59.696
IMPACT OF EACH ALTERNATIVE BE IN

02:38:59.763 --> 02:39:01.064
THE CONTEXT OF THAT GROWING

02:39:01.131 --> 02:39:04.034
ECONOMY. I'M AND- AND SO THAT'LL

02:39:04.101 --> 02:39:05.502
BE WHAT THE BOARD WILL BE

02:39:05.569 --> 02:39:07.504
CONSIDERING AS IT WEIGHS. ON

02:39:07.571 --> 02:39:08.405
EACH OF THE DIFFERENT

02:39:08.472 --> 02:39:11.842
ALTERNATIVES AND WHAT- THE

02:39:11.909 --> 02:39:12.509
AFFECTED EACH OF THE

02:39:12.576 --> 02:39:14.378
ALTERNATIVES WILL BE I MEAN I

02:39:14.444 --> 02:39:15.679
WILL NOTE THAT WHEN YOU THINK

02:39:15.746 --> 02:39:18.582
ABOUT. SORT OF THE TIMELINE AND

02:39:18.649 --> 02:39:20.450
ARE YOU LOOKING AT TWENTY THIRTY

02:39:20.517 --> 02:39:22.419
FIVE ARE YOU LOOKING AT TWNTY

02:39:22.486 --> 02:39:23.820
FORTY FIVE. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE

02:39:23.887 --> 02:39:27.157
AT. THE BENEFITS YOU ACHIEVE IF

02:39:27.224 --> 02:39:28.525
YOU GIVE YOURSELF A LITTLE MORE

02:39:28.592 --> 02:39:31.061
RUNWAY IN TERMS OF A TIME LINE.

02:39:31.128 --> 02:39:32.729
IS THAT YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO

02:39:32.796 --> 02:39:35.332
SEE COSTS COME DOWN. AND YOU

02:39:35.399 --> 02:39:36.700
HAVE THE ABILITY TO SEE NEW

02:39:36.767 --> 02:39:39.836
OPPORTUNITIES- COME ONLINE IN A

02:39:39.903 --> 02:39:42.572
WAY THAT REDUCES. THE FINANCIAL

02:39:42.639 --> 02:39:45.442
IMPACTS- TO CONSUMERS OF THE

02:39:45.509 --> 02:39:47.210
DIFFERENT STRATEGIES. YOU KNOW

02:39:47.277 --> 02:39:49.613
AS THE REDUCTION WE HAVE SEEN IN

02:39:49.680 --> 02:39:52.215
THE COST OF BOTH. VEHICLE

02:39:52.282 --> 02:39:53.850
BATTERIES AND IT YEAH-

02:39:53.917 --> 02:39:57.254
INDUSTRIAL SCALE- BATTERIES FOR

02:39:57.321 --> 02:40:00.357
ENERGY STORAGE. YOU CAN SEE

02:40:00.424 --> 02:40:02.059
THESE TREND LINES YOU CAN SEE

02:40:02.125 --> 02:40:04.127
THE TREND LINES OF RENEWABLE

02:40:04.194 --> 02:40:06.897
ENERGY- YOU KNOW WIND SOLAR.

02:40:06.964 --> 02:40:09.766
THOSE STRATEGIES GOING DOWN- AND

02:40:09.833 --> 02:40:11.902
IF YOU GIVE YOURSELF A LITTLE

02:40:11.969 --> 02:40:15.772
MORE RUNWAY- A TWO. X. X. TAKE

02:40:15.839 --> 02:40:16.606
ADVANTAGE OF THOSE COST

02:40:16.673 --> 02:40:20.143
BENEFITS- THAN THAT CAN MAKE THE

02:40:20.210 --> 02:40:21.311
WHOLE TRANSITION. MORE

02:40:21.378 --> 02:40:25.315
AFFORDABLE FOR RESIDENTS IN THE

02:40:25.382 --> 02:40:31.621
STATE. OTHER QUESTIONS I THINK

02:40:31.688 --> 02:40:33.657
SOME OF OUR GREAT WAS CHAIRED.

02:40:33.724 --> 02:40:35.158
THE ISSUE OF ALLOWANCES-

02:40:35.225 --> 02:40:39.830
CONSISTENTLY COMES UP. AND YOU

02:40:39.896 --> 02:40:41.498
KNOW JUST THE TOO MANY

02:40:41.565 --> 02:40:45.035
ALLOWANCES. ALTER THAT MAY NOT

02:40:45.102 --> 02:40:49.439
BE- HELP IN STABILIZE YOU KNOW

02:40:49.506 --> 02:40:52.809
THE EFFORTS THAT ARE UNDERWAY.

02:40:52.876 --> 02:40:54.411
CHAIR CAN YOU KIND OF GIVE US

02:40:54.478 --> 02:40:56.980
SOME THOUGHTS ON WHAT OPTIONS

02:40:57.047 --> 02:41:02.285
IMPOSSIBLE- YOU KNOW. CORRECTION

02:41:02.352 --> 02:41:05.055
THAT THE WE AT THE BOARD MIGHT

02:41:05.122 --> 02:41:06.923
BE GOING IN AND PERHAPS ALSO

02:41:06.990 --> 02:41:09.226
DOMINO'S SPOKE ABOUT- THE

02:41:09.292 --> 02:41:10.560
ALLOWANCES MAY HAVE SOME

02:41:10.627 --> 02:41:12.529
THOUGHTS AND IDEAS AS WELL I

02:41:12.596 --> 02:41:14.765
THINK THAT'S A HUGE TOPIC OF

02:41:14.831 --> 02:41:16.466
DISCUSSION THAT COMES UP-

02:41:16.533 --> 02:41:18.335
CONSISTENTLY AND SO WANT TO HEAR

02:41:18.402 --> 02:41:20.103
YOUR THOUGHTS AND I KNOW THAT

02:41:20.170 --> 02:41:21.805
THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS

02:41:21.872 --> 02:41:22.939
WATCHING ONE IN HERE YOUR

02:41:23.006 --> 02:41:24.508
RESPONSES. YEAH I MEAN IT'S

02:41:24.574 --> 02:41:27.978
ABSOLUTELY M. A. AN IMPORTANT

02:41:28.045 --> 02:41:30.213
ISSUE FOR US TO ADDRESS- AND SO

02:41:30.280 --> 02:41:32.849
OUR PLAN IS THAT WE WILL

02:41:32.916 --> 02:41:34.851
COMPLETE THE SCOPING PLAN AND

02:41:34.918 --> 02:41:36.787
THEN AS PART OF OUR

02:41:36.853 --> 02:41:38.255
IMPLEMENTATION STEPS- WE WILL BE

02:41:38.321 --> 02:41:40.557
TAKING A LOOK AT- AT CAP AND

02:41:40.624 --> 02:41:43.026
TRADE AND WE WILL LOOK AT THAT

02:41:43.093 --> 02:41:45.896
QUESTION OF- YOU KNOW HOW TO

02:41:45.962 --> 02:41:47.297
ADDRESS A ALLOWANCES WE WILL

02:41:47.364 --> 02:41:49.866
LOOK AT AND REGULATORY-

02:41:49.933 --> 02:41:52.502
PROVISIONS LAKE- THE LOW CARBON

02:41:52.569 --> 02:41:57.040
FUEL STANDARD AND OTHER THINGS-

02:41:57.107 --> 02:41:58.308
AND I THINK IT'S REALLY

02:41:58.375 --> 02:41:59.576
IMPORTANT THAT THAT BE DONE. AS

02:41:59.643 --> 02:42:01.878
PART OF THAT ROBUST REGULATORY

02:42:01.945 --> 02:42:04.848
PROCESS BECAUSE THERE ARE A BY A

02:42:04.915 --> 02:42:06.416
WIDE RANGE OF OPINIONS OUT

02:42:06.483 --> 02:42:09.252
THERE. ABOUT SORT OF WHAT THE

02:42:09.319 --> 02:42:11.221
BEST WAY TO DO IT I MEAN AS AS

02:42:11.288 --> 02:42:12.556
DALLAS MENTION THERE'S DIFFERENT

02:42:12.622 --> 02:42:14.391
WAYS TO KIND OF TACKLE THE ISSUE

02:42:14.458 --> 02:42:16.560
AND IT HAS DIFFERENT SORT OF

02:42:16.626 --> 02:42:17.360
EFFECTS ON THE PROGRAM IN

02:42:17.427 --> 02:42:19.129
DIFFERENT WAYS. AND SORT OF

02:42:19.196 --> 02:42:22.032
HAVING IT BE PART OF A ROBUST

02:42:22.099 --> 02:42:25.135
DISCUSSION ABOUT. WHAT CHANGES

02:42:25.202 --> 02:42:26.336
TO THE PROGRAMMER NEEDED WHAT

02:42:26.403 --> 02:42:28.071
UPDATES CAN HAPPEN AND HOW THOSE

02:42:28.138 --> 02:42:29.873
UPDATES CAN BE STRUCTURED IN A

02:42:29.940 --> 02:42:32.409
WAY. THAT PROVIDES KIND OF THE

02:42:32.476 --> 02:42:34.444
REGULATORY CERTAINTY THAT WE

02:42:34.511 --> 02:42:38.215
NEED- IS ED YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY

02:42:38.281 --> 02:42:40.217
IMPORTANT TO GET ALL OF THE ALL

02:42:40.283 --> 02:42:42.385
OF YOU POINTS AND ALL OF THAT-

02:42:42.452 --> 02:42:45.822
THE- PUBLIC IMPACT AND SO. WE

02:42:45.889 --> 02:42:48.658
WILL EMBARK ON THAT PROCESS AS

02:42:48.725 --> 02:42:49.826
SOON AS WE'RE DONE WITH THE

02:42:49.893 --> 02:42:51.361
SKIPPING PLAN. THOUSAND OF

02:42:51.428 --> 02:42:52.395
THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANTED

02:42:52.462 --> 02:42:58.835
TO ADD. TANK YOU. I THINK I

02:42:58.902 --> 02:43:00.637
WOULD POINT OUT THAT WE ARE WAY

02:43:00.704 --> 02:43:03.240
BEYOND THE EITHER OR OR KIND OF

02:43:03.306 --> 02:43:05.709
CONVERSATION THAT WE WERE HAVING

02:43:05.775 --> 02:43:07.777
OVER A DECADE AGO- I THINK WE

02:43:07.844 --> 02:43:09.446
RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE GOING

02:43:09.513 --> 02:43:11.181
THERE NEED TO BE A ROCK VARIETY

02:43:11.248 --> 02:43:13.283
OF DIRECT REGULATORY MEASURES.

02:43:13.350 --> 02:43:15.585
AND PROGRAMS AND STANDARDS TO

02:43:15.652 --> 02:43:17.287
ACHIEVE DIRECTED MARVEL BENEFITS

02:43:17.354 --> 02:43:19.156
AND SENSITIVE COMMUNITIES AND AT

02:43:19.222 --> 02:43:21.224
THE SAME TIME WE NEED TO INSERT

02:43:21.291 --> 02:43:22.826
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE

02:43:22.893 --> 02:43:24.528
COST EFFECTIVENESS IN ACHIEVING

02:43:24.594 --> 02:43:27.063
THE STATE'S. GOALS AS WELL FOR

02:43:27.130 --> 02:43:29.132
MEMBERS MAYES WAS REFERRING TO

02:43:29.199 --> 02:43:30.767
AND I THINK THAT THE CLIMATE

02:43:30.834 --> 02:43:32.702
POLICY PORTFOLIO HAS TO WEAVE

02:43:32.769 --> 02:43:34.504
THESE TWO APPROACHES TOGETHER.

02:43:34.571 --> 02:43:36.106
WHAT'S REALLY CRUCIAL IS THAT TO

02:43:36.173 --> 02:43:38.508
THE EXTENT THAT YOU HAVE SUCCESS

02:43:38.575 --> 02:43:40.977
AND ONE THAT IT NOT A ROAD THE

02:43:41.044 --> 02:43:43.380
INFLUENCE OF THE OTHER. SO WHEN

02:43:43.446 --> 02:43:45.582
WE HAVE A THEIR CARBON MARKET IN

02:43:45.649 --> 02:43:47.450
PLACE IN THE OTHER REGULATORY

02:43:47.517 --> 02:43:48.418
PROGRAMS OR HOPEFULLY

02:43:48.485 --> 02:43:50.720
INCREASINGLY SUCCESSFUL EVEN

02:43:50.787 --> 02:43:52.222
GOING SO FAR AS REDUCING VEHICLE

02:43:52.289 --> 02:43:53.490
MILES TRAVELED BUT IN ANY CASE

02:43:53.557 --> 02:43:54.758
VEHICLE FUEL EFFICIENCY IN

02:43:54.824 --> 02:43:56.793
ELECTRIC VEHICLES ETCETERA. THEN

02:43:56.860 --> 02:43:58.695
THAT CAN POTENTIALLY FREE UP

02:43:58.762 --> 02:44:03.833
ALLOWANCES. ABOUT AFFECT YOU

02:44:03.900 --> 02:44:05.669
PUSH DOWN IN ONE PLACE THE SAME

02:44:05.735 --> 02:44:07.270
EMISSIONS POP UP SOMEWHERE ELSE

02:44:07.337 --> 02:44:08.672
AND ALL THAT HAPPENS IS THE

02:44:08.738 --> 02:44:10.307
PRICE OF ALLOWANCES FALL IN THAT

02:44:10.373 --> 02:44:12.409
REMOVES THE INCENTIVE IN THAT

02:44:12.475 --> 02:44:13.843
CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE. THAT THE

02:44:13.910 --> 02:44:15.879
MARKET CAN PLAY SO WE'RE

02:44:15.946 --> 02:44:18.515
ADVOCATING FOR A MARKET DESIGN

02:44:18.582 --> 02:44:21.017
THAT ALIGNS TO THE MARKET WITH

02:44:21.084 --> 02:44:22.786
THE REGULATORY MEASURES AND SO

02:44:22.852 --> 02:44:24.087
THAT THEY WORK TOGETHER AND

02:44:24.154 --> 02:44:26.122
REINFORCE THE INCENTIVE FOR

02:44:26.189 --> 02:44:27.257
DIRECT ACTION THROUGH

02:44:27.324 --> 02:44:29.426
REGULATIONS THE ACTIONS OF LOCAL

02:44:29.492 --> 02:44:31.094
GOVERNMENTS AND INDEPENDENT

02:44:31.161 --> 02:44:33.230
ACTORS AND FIRMS. IT'S SUCH A

02:44:33.296 --> 02:44:34.998
REDUCE EMISSIONS AND NOT HAVE

02:44:35.065 --> 02:44:36.900
THAT BOUNCE BACK IN A ROW THE

02:44:36.967 --> 02:44:38.768
EFFECT OF THE MARKET. THAT'S

02:44:38.835 --> 02:44:40.570
WHAT'S AT THE HEART OF THE

02:44:40.637 --> 02:44:41.972
RECOMMENDATIONS WE HAVE. THANK

02:44:42.038 --> 02:44:44.407
YOU HOW HIGH ON THE THINGS TO DO

02:44:44.474 --> 02:44:46.843
LIST SHOULD THIS BE ON IN TERMS

02:44:46.910 --> 02:44:50.647
OF- WHEN WE- I. GET CLOSE TO

02:44:50.714 --> 02:44:52.082
WRAPPING UP THE SCOPING PLAN I

02:44:52.148 --> 02:44:54.417
MEAN. YOU KNOW IT COULD BE. I

02:44:54.484 --> 02:44:55.952
GET HOME ON THURSDAY EVENINGS

AND I GOT A HONEY DO LIST THAT I

02:44:58.722 --> 02:44:59.256
GOT TO TAKE CARE OF AND- AND

THEY'RE RANKED IN. TERMS OF

02:45:01.958 --> 02:45:04.060
WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT GIVEN THE

02:45:04.127 --> 02:45:05.228
- FOUR DAYS THAT I'VE BEEN GONE

02:45:05.295 --> 02:45:07.664
RIGHT AND SO WHEN WE'RE TALKING

02:45:07.731 --> 02:45:08.298
ABOUT THE ALLOWANCES WHERE WHERE

02:45:08.365 --> 02:45:11.368

02:45:11.434 --> 02:45:14.371
TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO. GET US.

02:45:14.437 --> 02:45:16.473

02:45:16.539 --> 02:45:17.874
OF ALL OF THE- DISCUSSIONS AND

02:45:17.941 --> 02:45:19.743
WE WERE JUST HAVING WITH OUR-

02:45:19.809 --> 02:45:21.344
GOOD FRIENDS. IN THE SENATE I

02:45:21.411 --> 02:45:24.381
MEAN DOES IT UP THERE IS IT IN

02:45:24.447 --> 02:45:32.789
BETWEEN. BOB I WILL GO AHEAD-

02:45:32.856 --> 02:45:34.791
YOU KNOW I MEAN I GUESS I WOULD

02:45:34.858 --> 02:45:38.695
SAY THAT THAT AN IMPORTANT NEXT

02:45:38.762 --> 02:45:41.865
STEP ANYTIME YOU ADOPT YOU KNOW

02:45:41.931 --> 02:45:42.565
AFTER YOU ADOPT THE SCOPING

02:45:42.632 --> 02:45:46.136
PLAN- AND AFTER WE HAVE HAD THE

02:45:46.202 --> 02:45:47.871
OPPORTUNITY COLLECTS TO COLLECT

02:45:47.937 --> 02:45:49.873
DATA BASED ON THE CAP AND TRADE

02:45:49.939 --> 02:45:51.708
PROGRAM AS IT CURRENTLY EXISTS

02:45:51.775 --> 02:45:54.110
RATE LIKE YOU KNOW IT'S IT IS

02:45:54.177 --> 02:45:55.812
OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO KIND OF

02:45:55.879 --> 02:45:57.981
TAKE A LOOK AT THE PROGRAM AND

02:45:58.048 --> 02:45:59.149
SEE WHAT CHANGES NEED TO BE

02:45:59.215 --> 02:46:01.418
MADE- AND THERE COULD BE CHANGES

02:46:01.484 --> 02:46:03.053
MADE FOR IT YOU KNOW IN ANY

02:46:03.119 --> 02:46:04.788
NUMBER OF AREAS THAT WE COULD

02:46:04.854 --> 02:46:07.223
CONSIDER. AND I GUESS I THINK OF

02:46:07.290 --> 02:46:09.392
IT KIND OF AS A LAWYER RIGHT

02:46:09.459 --> 02:46:10.960
ONCE YOU OPEN UP A REGULATION

02:46:11.027 --> 02:46:12.329
LAKE SAYS SOMETHING AS COMPLEX

02:46:12.395 --> 02:46:14.097
AS CAP AND TRADE THERE'S GOING

02:46:14.164 --> 02:46:16.633
TO BE A LOT OF ISSUES THAT COME

02:46:16.700 --> 02:46:18.735
UP AND WILL BE PART OF THAT

02:46:18.802 --> 02:46:20.136
DISCUSSION- SO I THINK OF ALL

02:46:20.203 --> 02:46:21.471
THOSE ISSUES AS KIND OF

02:46:21.538 --> 02:46:22.872
PROCEEDING TOGETHER RIGHT LIKE

02:46:22.939 --> 02:46:24.874
ALL OF THE ADVOCACY THAT WE HAVE

02:46:24.941 --> 02:46:27.477
GOTTEN OVER TIME IT ALL SORT OF

02:46:27.544 --> 02:46:29.746
COULD BECOMES PART OF THE

02:46:29.813 --> 02:46:31.981
DISCUSSION- AND- AND SO WE WILL

02:46:32.048 --> 02:46:33.717
FINISH THE COPING PLAN WE WILL

02:46:33.783 --> 02:46:37.120
YOU KNOW COLLECT MORE DATA ON

02:46:37.187 --> 02:46:38.421
THE PROGRAM AS IT EXISTS NOW.

02:46:38.488 --> 02:46:43.893
THEN THE FUN BEGINS. IF I MAY

02:46:43.960 --> 02:46:46.563
COMMENT I WOULD SEPARATE THE

02:46:46.629 --> 02:46:47.430
QUESTION IN THE ALLOWANCE MARKET

02:46:47.497 --> 02:46:49.566
INTO SORT OF TWO PARTS ONE IS TO

02:46:49.632 --> 02:46:51.434
DO WITH THE STRUCTURE OF THE

02:46:51.501 --> 02:46:53.837
MARKET SUCH THAT IT'S DESIGNED

02:46:53.903 --> 02:46:54.437
TO WORK WELL WITH THE OTHER

02:46:54.504 --> 02:46:55.839
REGULATORY INITIATIVES AND I

02:46:55.905 --> 02:46:58.141
WOULD PUT THAT HIGH ON THE TO DO

02:46:58.208 --> 02:46:59.509
LIST BECAUSE I THINK IT CAN BE

02:46:59.576 --> 02:47:01.511
DONE. RELATIVELY STAND

02:47:01.578 --> 02:47:03.113
STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY WITH IT WITH

02:47:03.179 --> 02:47:04.581
THE EXERCISING EXISTING

02:47:04.647 --> 02:47:06.349
REGULATORY AUTHORITY JUST IN THE

02:47:06.416 --> 02:47:09.152
WAY THAT A OR B. HAS USE THAT

02:47:09.219 --> 02:47:10.120
AUTHORITY PREVIOUSLY SO FOR AS I

02:47:10.186 --> 02:47:11.321
MENTIONED FOR EXAMPLE THE

02:47:11.388 --> 02:47:12.555
INTRODUCTION OF ADDITIONAL PRICE

02:47:12.622 --> 02:47:14.124
STEPS OR SOMETHING SO THE MARKET

02:47:14.190 --> 02:47:16.659
AUTOMATICALLY RESPONDS TO OTHER

02:47:16.726 --> 02:47:18.828
INITIATIVES THAT THE STATE IS

02:47:18.895 --> 02:47:21.197
MAKING. THEM THERE IS A BIGGER

02:47:21.264 --> 02:47:22.599
THINK. THE ONLY A BIGGER THING

02:47:22.665 --> 02:47:24.401
BECAUSE IT'S PROBABLY TO PUT TO

02:47:24.467 --> 02:47:26.202
COME TO A DECISION IS A HARDER

02:47:26.269 --> 02:47:28.204
THING TO DO. ABOUT ADJUSTING THE

02:47:28.271 --> 02:47:30.073
OVERALL SUPPLY IN A DIRECTED WAY

02:47:30.140 --> 02:47:31.908
BY PERHAPS REDUCING THE NUMBER

02:47:31.975 --> 02:47:33.243
OF ALLOWANCES THAT ARE ISSUED

02:47:33.309 --> 02:47:34.544
EACH YEAR I ALSO THINK THAT

02:47:34.611 --> 02:47:37.180
THAT'S- VERY IMPORTANT AND- AND

02:47:37.247 --> 02:47:39.015
INCREASINGLY URGENT BUT- IT

02:47:39.082 --> 02:47:40.116
INCREASINGLY WERE IS GOING TO

02:47:40.183 --> 02:47:42.385
REQUIRE A PROCESS THAT I'M SURE

02:47:42.452 --> 02:47:44.854
CHIU AROUND OFF WILL. LOSE A LOT

02:47:44.921 --> 02:47:46.222
OF SLEEP OVER BEFORE RESOLUTION

02:47:46.289 --> 02:47:47.824
ABOUT DECISION COMES TOGETHER I

02:47:47.891 --> 02:47:49.592
KNOW THAT I THINK IT'S REALLY

02:47:49.659 --> 02:47:51.528
IMPORTANT TO DO THAT. BUT I.

02:47:51.594 --> 02:47:53.163
WOULD NOT WANT TO HOLD THE ONE

02:47:53.229 --> 02:47:55.098
FOR THE OTHER AND I THINK THAT.

02:47:55.165 --> 02:47:56.633
MARKET REDESIGNED COULD HAPPEN

02:47:56.699 --> 02:47:59.202
AN EXPEDITED WAY. I THINK JUST

02:47:59.269 --> 02:48:01.337
THE- LINE OF QUESTIONS MAY BE

02:48:01.404 --> 02:48:03.006
CAUSING A LOT OF PEOPLE

02:48:03.072 --> 02:48:04.774
WATCHING- TO NOT HAVE SOME GOOD

02:48:04.841 --> 02:48:07.377
NIGHTS OF SLEEP. IN THE NEXT FEW

02:48:07.444 --> 02:48:09.379
WEEKS AND- MONTHS AND I SAY THAT

02:48:09.446 --> 02:48:14.551
BECAUSE- I KNOW THERE ARE. TWO

02:48:14.617 --> 02:48:15.752
SIDES TO THIS DISCUSSION- AND-

02:48:15.819 --> 02:48:18.121
THEY BALK TO US AND ASKED US YOU

02:48:18.188 --> 02:48:20.957
KNOW- TO THE CONSIDERED ONE

02:48:21.024 --> 02:48:23.393
ACTION OR OR THE OTHER I. I'M OF

02:48:23.460 --> 02:48:25.094
THE MINDSET THAT WE DO HAVE AN

02:48:25.161 --> 02:48:26.463
OVER ABUNDANCE OF ALLOWANCES UP

02:48:26.529 --> 02:48:27.831
THERE AND- THERE WILL BE

02:48:27.897 --> 02:48:29.232
SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE

02:48:29.299 --> 02:48:30.400
SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. YOU

02:48:30.467 --> 02:48:31.968
TOUCHED ON VEHICLE MILES

02:48:32.035 --> 02:48:34.237
TRAVELED IN AND I KNOW. ALL OF

02:48:34.304 --> 02:48:36.372
US UP HERE ARE STRONG SUPPORTERS

02:48:36.439 --> 02:48:39.275
OF THE GOVERNOR'S. ORDERS TO

02:48:39.342 --> 02:48:41.010
ELECTRIFY OUR TRANSPORTATION

02:48:41.077 --> 02:48:43.179
SYSTEM I HAVE A- VESTED INTEREST

02:48:43.246 --> 02:48:45.415
GIVEN THE- NATURE OF THE

02:48:45.482 --> 02:48:47.083
DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT IN THE

02:48:47.150 --> 02:48:48.551
ROLE THEY CAN PLAY. I JUST FOR

02:48:48.618 --> 02:48:50.386
THE STATE BUT NATIONALLY WHEN IT

02:48:50.453 --> 02:48:51.554
COMES TO. PROVIDING THE

02:48:51.621 --> 02:48:54.190
ESSENTIAL RESOURCE- THAT-

02:48:54.257 --> 02:48:57.494
STORAGE BATTERY ENERGY STORAGE

02:48:57.560 --> 02:48:58.895
REQUIRES AS WELL AS VEHICLES.

02:48:58.962 --> 02:49:01.130
HOW ARE WE IN AND LOVE TO HEAR

02:49:01.197 --> 02:49:01.898

ACROSS THE PANELS HERE- WE

PEOPLE. WHO LIVE IN MULTI FAMILY

02:49:07.604 --> 02:49:09.138
HOMES WHO DON'T HAVE STREET

02:49:09.205 --> 02:49:11.207
PARKING WHO DON'T. DON'T FIT

02:49:11.274 --> 02:49:13.743
INTO THIS EQUATION OF EVERYONE

02:49:13.810 --> 02:49:15.578
WILL HAVE AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE IN

02:49:15.645 --> 02:49:17.213
INFRASTRUCTURE WILL BE.

02:49:17.280 --> 02:49:20.416
AVAILABLE EVERYWHERE- LOVE TO

02:49:20.483 --> 02:49:21.518
HEAR WHAT THE THOUGHTS ARE ON

02:49:21.584 --> 02:49:23.620
THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF

02:49:23.686 --> 02:49:24.721
PEOPLE THAT AGAIN DON'T FIT

02:49:24.787 --> 02:49:28.525
INTO. THAT PARTICULAR. FORMULA

02:49:28.591 --> 02:49:30.293
THAT- THAT WERE PURSUING

02:49:30.360 --> 02:49:32.462
CURRENTLY. N. DA AND WE

POPULATION THAT- THAT ARE

02:49:38.601 --> 02:49:42.805
CONCERNED. FROM MANY ASPECTS- OF

02:49:42.872 --> 02:49:46.643
TRYING TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL.

02:49:46.709 --> 02:49:49.512
OKAY I'LL START M. I WOULD SAY

02:49:49.579 --> 02:49:52.415
AS A COUPLE THINGS I MEAN YOU

02:49:52.482 --> 02:49:55.385
KNOW. IT IS IMPORTANT TO ENSURE

02:49:55.451 --> 02:50:00.690
THAT WE ARE- PROVIDING THE ZERO

02:50:00.757 --> 02:50:01.691
EMISSION INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE

02:50:01.758 --> 02:50:03.593
NEED TO SUPPORT THIS YEAR

02:50:03.660 --> 02:50:05.461
MISSION MOBILITY THAT WE WANT TO

02:50:05.528 --> 02:50:07.096
SEE AN END SO WE WORK CLOSELY

02:50:07.163 --> 02:50:09.098
WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND

02:50:09.165 --> 02:50:11.601
THE CPC AND OTHERS- TO THINK

02:50:11.668 --> 02:50:13.369
ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE

02:50:13.436 --> 02:50:15.638
STRATEGIES AROUND- TACKLING SOME

02:50:15.705 --> 02:50:17.774
OF THE CHALLENGES TACKLING RURAL

02:50:17.840 --> 02:50:21.611
CHARGING. TACKLING MULTI FAMILY-

02:50:21.678 --> 02:50:22.679
CHARGING YOU KNOW THINKING

02:50:22.745 --> 02:50:24.847
ABOUT- YOU KNOW CHARGING PAUSES

02:50:24.914 --> 02:50:26.382
AND WORKPLACE CHARGING AND

02:50:26.449 --> 02:50:27.917
WORKING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

02:50:27.984 --> 02:50:30.787
IN THEIR KIND OF LAND USE ROLE-

02:50:30.853 --> 02:50:33.022
WHERE CAN THEY LOCATE CHARGING

02:50:33.089 --> 02:50:38.061
THAT THERE AT RESIDENTS CAN USE-

02:50:38.127 --> 02:50:40.797
AND ALSO KIND OF TO YOUR POINT

02:50:40.863 --> 02:50:46.336
RECOGNIZING THAT- NOT EVERYONE-

02:50:46.402 --> 02:50:51.374
HAS- ACCESS TO- A BRAND NEW CAR

02:50:51.441 --> 02:50:53.910
RATE- AND SO HAVING THEM.

02:50:53.977 --> 02:50:58.615
OPPORTUNITIES FOR RESIDENTS TO-

02:50:58.681 --> 02:51:01.084
PURCHASE- YOU KNOW DEVELOPING A

02:51:01.150 --> 02:51:02.685
ROBUST SECONDARY MARKET ENSURING

02:51:02.752 --> 02:51:03.987
THAT THAT'S THAT THOSE VEHICLES

02:51:04.053 --> 02:51:05.521
ARE IN THE SECONDARY MARKET

02:51:05.588 --> 02:51:10.426
ENSURING THAT THE ROBUST- AND-

02:51:10.493 --> 02:51:13.196
AND- CONTINUING TO WORK TO

02:51:13.262 --> 02:51:15.598
ENSURE THAT THERE ARE. A WIDE

02:51:15.665 --> 02:51:18.801
SUITE OF CHARGING OPTIONS OF

02:51:18.868 --> 02:51:21.270
THAT FOLKS CAN USE- IS PART OF

02:51:21.337 --> 02:51:23.139
ALL THE IMPLEMENTATION WORK THAT

02:51:23.206 --> 02:51:28.945
WE'RE DOING. BRIEFLY THIS IS A

02:51:29.012 --> 02:51:31.314
LITTLE BIT OUTSIDE MY PORTFOLIO

02:51:31.381 --> 02:51:33.116
BUT I WILL MAKE TAKE OBVIOUS

02:51:33.182 --> 02:51:34.784
SUB- ENDORSED OBVIOUS

02:51:34.851 --> 02:51:36.085
OBSERVATION THAT SHARON OFF MADE

02:51:36.152 --> 02:51:37.487
EARLIER ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF

02:51:37.553 --> 02:51:38.755
COORDINATION BETWEEN STATE AND

02:51:38.821 --> 02:51:39.922
LOCAL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT I

02:51:39.989 --> 02:51:41.958
MEAN I SAW THIS BACK. IN MY

02:51:42.025 --> 02:51:43.693
EARLIER DAYS FOR EXAMPLE IN THE

02:51:43.760 --> 02:51:45.128
BREAKOUT OF INCLUSIONARY HOUSING

02:51:45.194 --> 02:51:46.229
IN ORANGE COUNTY IN THE

02:51:46.295 --> 02:51:47.897
SEVENTIES THE REPAIR WORK

02:51:47.964 --> 02:51:48.798
REQUIRES A TURNAROUND AT THE

02:51:48.865 --> 02:51:50.433
LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL AND WE

02:51:50.500 --> 02:51:51.167
CAN'T JUST SAY IT'S LOCAL

02:51:51.234 --> 02:51:52.301
GOVERNMENTS DOING SOMETHING

02:51:52.368 --> 02:51:53.603
WRONG I THINK THE STATE IS TO

02:51:53.670 --> 02:51:55.405
PROVIDE THE PROPER KIND OF

02:51:55.471 --> 02:51:56.139
INCENTIVES AND DIRECTOR FOR

02:51:56.205 --> 02:51:57.340
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN ORDER TO

02:51:57.407 --> 02:51:58.241
EXPLOIT CERTAIN TYPES OF.

02:51:58.307 --> 02:51:59.475
FIGHTING AND I THINK THAT WAS

02:51:59.542 --> 02:52:01.310
ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES

02:52:01.377 --> 02:52:02.445
THE STATE FACES BUT SPECIFICALLY

02:52:02.512 --> 02:52:03.780
WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF MY

02:52:03.846 --> 02:52:05.515
PORTFOLIO ON THE CAP AND TRADE

02:52:05.581 --> 02:52:07.116
PROGRAM I WILL POINT BACK TO THE

02:52:07.183 --> 02:52:08.484
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND IN

02:52:08.551 --> 02:52:09.485
THE ROLE OF INVESTMENTS ARE

02:52:09.552 --> 02:52:10.687
PROBABLY INVESTMENTS. YOU KNOW

02:52:10.753 --> 02:52:12.388
THE MAJORITY OF US WAS BY FAR

02:52:12.455 --> 02:52:13.656
HAVE TO COME FROM THE PRIVATE

02:52:13.723 --> 02:52:15.391
SECTOR BUT THOSE INVESTMENTS GET

02:52:15.458 --> 02:52:17.060
COORDINATED INTENSE AND DIRECTED

02:52:17.126 --> 02:52:19.328
THROUGH THE ROLE OF THE OF THE

02:52:19.395 --> 02:52:21.564
STATE AND- IN PUTTING

02:52:21.631 --> 02:52:23.566
INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE. OTHERS

02:52:23.633 --> 02:52:24.801
BEEN OVER SIXTEEN BILLION

02:52:24.867 --> 02:52:26.803
DOLLARS INVESTED THROUGH THE

02:52:26.869 --> 02:52:27.704
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND

02:52:27.770 --> 02:52:29.572
TODAY AND THAT THE REFORMS THAT

02:52:29.639 --> 02:52:31.307
I WAS SUGGESTING IN MY REMARKS

02:52:31.374 --> 02:52:33.209
COULD ACTUALLY ACCELERATE THE

02:52:33.276 --> 02:52:34.577
AROUND REVENUE GOING TO THE

02:52:34.644 --> 02:52:36.245
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION. BONTA

02:52:36.312 --> 02:52:38.715
BRIDGE PARTY ABOUT THAT FURTHER

THE TRANSITION. ACTUALLY OCCUR.

02:57:57.700 --> 02:57:59.668
WHEN THE WORKERS THEMSELVES

DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THESE FUNDS

02:58:01.570 --> 02:58:02.505

03:00:14.670 --> 03:00:16.605
WORK I THINK WE'RE ALL FOCUSED

03:00:16.672 --> 03:00:18.941
ON FIGURING OUT. CLIMATE JUSTICE

03:00:19.008 --> 03:00:21.143
EQUITY NOT ONLY FOR THE

03:00:21.210 --> 03:00:22.444
ENVIRONMENT AND THE COMMUNITIES

03:00:22.511 --> 03:00:23.846
THAT WE WANT TO PROTECT BUT FOR

03:00:23.913 --> 03:00:25.381
THE VERY WORKERS THAT ACTUALLY

03:00:25.447 --> 03:00:28.117
LIVE AND WORK AND SUPPORT THEIR

03:00:28.184 --> 03:00:30.085
FAMILIES IN THESE COMMUNITIES

03:00:30.152 --> 03:00:32.488
AND SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:00:32.555 --> 03:00:33.255
THERE'S AN ALIGNMENT AND

03:00:33.322 --> 03:00:36.158
CONNECTION IN TERMS OF- THE PORT

03:00:36.225 --> 03:00:39.328
GOODS MOVEMENT FREIGHT-

03:00:39.395 --> 03:00:40.329
OBVIOUSLY THE PORT OF LOS

03:00:40.396 --> 03:00:42.798
ANGELES IS THE BIGGEST ONE OF

03:00:42.865 --> 03:00:44.366
THE BIGGEST IN. THE ENTIRE

03:00:44.433 --> 03:00:47.036
NATION IF NOT THE WORLD AND IT

03:00:47.102 --> 03:00:50.506
RUNS THROUGH OF OUR ENTIRE STATE

03:00:50.573 --> 03:00:52.942
AND THE NATION AND SO I THINK

03:00:53.008 --> 03:00:55.311
THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY THERE

03:00:55.377 --> 03:00:56.445
THAT WE HAVEN'T QUITE FLUSHED

03:00:56.512 --> 03:00:59.515
OUT OF THAT CERTAINLY ALIGNS

03:00:59.582 --> 03:01:03.285
CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS AS WELL AS

03:01:03.352 --> 03:01:05.221
THE IMPORTANCE OF SUPPORTING

03:01:05.287 --> 03:01:08.157
LABOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT- AND

03:01:08.224 --> 03:01:11.327

WELL YEAH THANK YOU FOR THOSE

03:01:16.232 --> 03:01:17.700
COMMENTS I THINK THAT THAT'S

03:01:17.766 --> 03:01:18.767
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AS SOMEONE

03:01:18.834 --> 03:01:20.169
WHO'S WORKED ON SEVERAL

03:01:20.236 --> 03:01:22.571
ITERATIONS OF THE TRUCK RULES AT

03:01:22.638 --> 03:01:23.472
THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND ON

03:01:23.539 --> 03:01:25.608
THE PLAN TO TRY TO HELP CLEAN UP

03:01:25.674 --> 03:01:27.576
SOME OF THE POLLUTION AROUND THE

03:01:27.643 --> 03:01:28.410
PORT OF STOCKTON. THAT'S

03:01:28.477 --> 03:01:29.445
DEFINITELY AN ADVANCEMENT THAT

03:01:29.511 --> 03:01:30.846
WE THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND

03:01:30.913 --> 03:01:32.915
HOW DOES THIS ALIGN WITH WORKERS

03:01:32.982 --> 03:01:34.750
SO JUST AGAIN TO WAYS THAT THEIR

03:01:34.817 --> 03:01:36.018
AGENCIES OPERATE THAT WERE

03:01:36.085 --> 03:01:37.419
LOOKING TO IMPROVE AT LEAST IN

03:01:37.486 --> 03:01:38.821
THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. IS

03:01:51.333 --> 03:01:52.501
PAPERWORK FOR THEM- AND FRANKLY

03:01:52.568 --> 03:01:54.203
TO MEET OUR CLEAN AIR AND

03:01:54.270 --> 03:01:55.437
CLIMATE GOALS WE ALSO THINK THAT

03:01:55.504 --> 03:01:57.273
THERE NEEDS TO BE AND- ENDS TO

03:01:57.339 --> 03:01:58.440
ANY INCENTIVE MONEY FOR NATURAL

03:01:58.507 --> 03:02:00.175

03:04:38.934 --> 03:04:41.236
TWENTY THIRTY GOAL. WELL I WOULD

03:04:41.303 --> 03:04:43.172
SAY THAT THE THAT THE JURY STILL

03:04:43.238 --> 03:04:44.706

HAVE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE

03:04:48.343 --> 03:04:49.845
INCREASED IN STRINGENCY STARTING

03:04:49.912 --> 03:04:51.280
IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE EVERYTHING
