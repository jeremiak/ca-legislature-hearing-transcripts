AN IS BOTH. IT'S LABOR AND SEX

00:30:38.636 --> 00:30:42.941
THERE'S ED I THINK FOR MANY IT

00:30:43.007 --> 00:30:44.776
WAS VIEWED PRIMARILY THROUGH

00:30:44.842 --> 00:30:45.476
THE LENS OF THIS IS SEX

00:30:45.543 --> 00:30:47.445
TRAFFICKING BUT I THINK THAT

00:30:47.512 --> 00:30:49.948
WHAT WE SEE IS THAT IN MANY

00:30:50.014 --> 00:30:52.717
CASES IT'S BOTH THE VICTIMS ARE

00:30:52.784 --> 00:30:54.452
BEING USED FOR BOTH AND IN

00:30:54.519 --> 00:30:56.554
OTHER CASES IT'S JUST ONE OR

00:30:56.621 --> 00:30:57.956
THE OTHER AND THE OTHER THING I

00:30:58.022 --> 00:31:00.425
WANTED TO RATE IS THAT IT'S

00:31:00.491 --> 00:31:01.693
MORE CONGESTED NATIONAL SOON

00:31:01.759 --> 00:31:03.828
OTHERWISE IT'S MORE THAN JUST

00:31:03.895 --> 00:31:04.562
PEOPLE THAT ARE BEING BROUGHT

00:31:04.629 --> 00:31:06.064
IN FROM OTHER COUNTRIES BUT

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:08.266
DOMESTIC SO. CAN ALL RELATE A

00:31:08.333 --> 00:31:09.601
COUPLE OF THINGS IN MY OWN

00:31:09.667 --> 00:31:12.870
DISTRICT- OVER A DECADE AGO

00:31:12.937 --> 00:31:15.440
THERE WAS AN INCIDENT WHERE A

00:31:15.506 --> 00:31:18.910
BERKELEY HIGH STUDENTS NOTICED

00:31:18.977 --> 00:31:21.012
THERE'S A MOTEL RIGHT ACROSS

00:31:21.079 --> 00:31:21.779
THE STREET FROM BERKELEY HIGH

00:31:21.846 --> 00:31:25.183
SCHOOL AND THE STUDENTS TO

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:25.783
WRITE FOR THE BERKELEY HIGH

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:27.185
PAPER NOTICED THAT THERE WERE

00:31:27.252 --> 00:31:29.654
THESE GIRLS THAT EVERY DAY

00:31:29.721 --> 00:31:32.023
WORKS WEEPING IN FRONT OF THIS

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:32.924
MOTEL AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO

00:31:32.991 --> 00:31:34.359
SCHOOL AND THEY NOTICED EVERY

00:31:34.425 --> 00:31:36.361
DAY SEEING THOSE GIRLS KNOWING

00:31:36.427 --> 00:31:37.829
THAT THEY WERE SCHOOL AGE AND

00:31:37.895 --> 00:31:39.864
WONDERING WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

00:31:39.931 --> 00:31:42.533
SO A STAY DURING MY BEST GAVE

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:44.602
REPORTING AND BEGAN TO INTERACT

00:31:44.669 --> 00:31:45.937
WITH THESE YOUNG WOMEN AND THEY

00:31:46.004 --> 00:31:48.539
FOUND THESE YOUNG WOMEN WERE

00:31:48.606 --> 00:31:52.744
BROUGHT OVER BY THE OWNER OF-THE MOTEL WHO ALSO LOTS OF

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:55.046
THEIR PROPERTY AND THEY WERE

00:31:55.113 --> 00:31:58.116
SICKLY THE GENERAL NO SIR THIS

00:31:58.182 --> 00:32:00.718
FOR THIS PROPERTY BUT PAID.

00:32:00.785 --> 00:32:08.426
THEY WERE ALL SO BEING. AT OLD

00:32:08.493 --> 00:32:10.662
FOR SEX. EIGHT NINE AS A RESULT

00:32:10.728 --> 00:32:12.830
OF THE BERKELEY HIGH ARTICLE

00:32:12.897 --> 00:32:15.900
THE WAS A- AND A RING WAS BASIC

00:32:15.967 --> 00:32:17.502
STOCK. MEANWHILE IN MY DID WE

00:32:17.568 --> 00:32:19.537
HAD SITUATIONS WERE OUTSIDE OF

00:32:19.604 --> 00:32:21.806
GROUP HOMES AND OUTSIDE OF

00:32:21.873 --> 00:32:24.509
LOCATIONS WHERE GOOD SERVICES

00:32:24.575 --> 00:32:26.644
ARE PROVIDED TO OUR FOSTER

00:32:26.711 --> 00:32:28.379
YOUTH WE HAD PREDATORS

00:32:28.446 --> 00:32:33.017
BASICALLY- RIGHT AROUND OUTSIDE

00:32:33.084 --> 00:32:36.521
OF THOSE AREAS. TO RECRUIT

00:32:36.587 --> 00:32:38.723
THESE FOSTER THE MOSTLY YOUNG

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:42.694
WOMEN BUT BOYS ALSO INTO THEIR

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:45.830
SEX TRADE AND OF COURSE THESE

00:32:45.897 --> 00:32:48.266
FOSTER KIDS ARE EXTRAORDINARILY

00:32:48.333 --> 00:32:51.402
VULNERABLE WITH THE LITLE A

00:32:51.469 --> 00:32:54.472
WITH FEW ADULTS THAT THEY CAN

00:32:54.539 --> 00:32:55.973
RELY ON- DEPEND ON AND OF

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:57.775
COURSE THE PEOPLE THAT DO THIS

00:32:57.842 --> 00:33:00.511
ARE VERY GOOD AT GETTING

00:33:00.578 --> 00:33:02.347
VULNERABLE PEOPLE TO FEEL THAT

00:33:02.413 --> 00:33:04.015
SOMEHOW THEY CAN TRUST THEM AND

00:33:04.082 --> 00:33:05.717
RELY ON THEM. SO I THINK IT'S

00:33:05.783 --> 00:33:07.785
IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND

00:33:07.852 --> 00:33:09.554
THAT THIS IS INTERNATIONAL AND

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:12.857
DOMESTIC FOR LABOR PURPOSES AND

00:33:12.924 --> 00:33:14.325

MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS

00:33:39.417 --> 00:33:40.551
WHICH IS THE REASON GOVERNMENT

00:33:40.618 --> 00:33:42.553
IS SUPPOSED TO EXIST ANYWAY TO

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:44.989
