01:03:19.695 --> 01:03:21.397
DESCRIPTION OF THE AUTHOR GAVE

01:03:21.464 --> 01:03:23.766
ON THE REALITIES A PROBATION

01:03:23.833 --> 01:03:25.234
ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH MY

01:03:25.301 --> 01:03:27.170
EXPERIENCE IN THE CRIMINAL

COURTS. ME NUMBER ONE OPERATION

01:03:32.074 --> 01:03:35.444
IS OFTEN USED AS PART OF THE

01:03:35.511 --> 01:03:37.547
DISK THE JUDICIAL DISCRETION.

01:03:37.613 --> 01:03:40.850

IN MANY CASES WHERE BOTH THE

CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THIS. CAP

THAT ARE TIED TO THE PERIODS OF

01:05:06.168 --> 01:05:09.071
INTERFERE WITH THOSE ATTEMPTS

01:05:09.138 --> 01:05:10.673

COMPLETING. IT COULD BE A LOT

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:19.361
OF WIDE VARIETY OF THINGS. THAT

01:08:19.428 --> 01:08:20.996
IN MANY CASES WERE NOT IN THE

01:08:21.063 --> 01:08:23.699
CONTROL OF- OF THE PROBATIONER

01:08:23.766 --> 01:08:25.334
AND YET IT'S ONE STRIKE AND

TO MY COLLEAGUE FOR TORRANCE-

01:11:12.101 --> 01:11:14.236
FOR RAISING SOME ISSUES THAT I

CAN ADDRESS AND MY CLOTHES YOU

01:11:15.938 --> 01:11:17.906

01:11:21.377 --> 01:11:23.779
XIN CANNOT BE LINKED WITH

01:11:25.748 --> 01:11:27.883

WITH YOU FOR TEN YEARS AND YOU

01:11:34.156 --> 01:11:36.025
STILL HAVE TO PAY THAT BACK.

01:11:36.091 --> 01:11:37.993
THIS DOES NOT IMPACT NEW CRIMES

01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:39.862
IF YOU COMMIT A NEW CRIME AND

01:11:39.928 --> 01:11:40.863
YOU ARE CHARGED WITH THE NEW

01:11:40.929 --> 01:11:44.233
CRIME THE CLOCK STOPS AND YOU

01:11:44.299 --> 01:11:44.967
HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE NEW

01:11:45.034 --> 01:11:47.102
CRIME. MY COLLEAGUE FROM

01:11:47.169 --> 01:11:49.171
TORRANCE IS CORRECT PROBATION

01:11:49.238 --> 01:11:51.674
AND PROSECUTORS OFTEN DO USE

01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:53.409
PROBATION AND THE TERMS OF

01:11:53.475 --> 01:11:55.310
BLACK PROBATION AS AN END RUN

01:11:55.377 --> 01:11:57.780
AROUND NEW CHARGES WHERE THEY

01:11:57.846 --> 01:11:59.314
MIGHT NOT HAVE THE FAX AND

01:11:59.381 --> 01:12:01.550
CANNOT ACTUALLY CHARGED. A

01:12:01.617 --> 01:12:03.052
DEFENDANT WITH THE NEW CRIME

01:12:03.118 --> 01:12:05.921
BUT THAT IS ALSO NOT JUST. AND

01:12:05.988 --> 01:12:07.890
WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES WHY WE

01:12:07.956 --> 01:12:09.858
ARE USING THAT SYSTEM TO

01:12:09.925 --> 01:12:11.660
CONTINUE TO TETHER FOLKS TO

01:12:11.727 --> 01:12:14.797
PROBATION WITH THE FEAR OF

01:12:14.863 --> 01:12:16.331
PUTTING THEM IN PRISON OR JAIL.

01:12:16.398 --> 01:12:17.800
I WANT TO ALSO ADD THAT WE

01:12:17.866 --> 01:12:19.702
SPEND AS A STATE TWO BILLION

01:12:19.768 --> 01:12:22.104
DOLLARS INCARCERATING FOLKS FOR

01:12:22.171 --> 01:12:24.573
TECHNICAL VIOLATIONS AS WE

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:26.942
STRUGGLE WITH OUR BUDGET. ITEM

01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:30.179
I MUST. ASK THAT WE AGREED THAT

01:12:30.245 --> 01:12:31.213
WE CAN SPEND THOSE TWO BILLION

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:33.015
DOLLARS SOME PLACE ELSE WHERE

01:12:33.082 --> 01:12:34.750
WE WILL SEE A GREATER TURN ON

01:12:34.817 --> 01:12:36.452
INVESTMENT. THIS DOES NOT

01:12:36.518 --> 01:12:38.087
IMPACT JUDICIAL DISCRETION IF

01:12:38.153 --> 01:12:39.088
YOU ARE GROSSLY OUT OF

01:12:39.154 --> 01:12:40.289
COMPLIANCE EVEN WITH THE

01:12:40.355 --> 01:12:42.124
CURRENT LAW THE JUDGE CAN

01:12:42.191 --> 01:12:48.197
REVOKE YOUR PROBATION.

01:12:48.263 --> 01:12:51.667
ULTIMATELY I WANT TO SAY WHY

01:12:51.734 --> 01:12:55.104
THIS IS A BLACK CAUCUS PRIORITY.

01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:56.939
BECAUSE THE DATA JUST LIKE THE

01:12:57.005 --> 01:12:58.407
DATA SHOWS THAT YOU CAN HAVE

01:12:58.474 --> 01:13:00.375
AFFECTED TERMS OF PROBATION THE

01:13:00.442 --> 01:13:02.144
SHORTER THE TERMS ARE THE MORE

01:13:02.211 --> 01:13:03.512
FOCUSED THEY ARE ON TREATMENT

01:13:03.579 --> 01:13:05.380
AND ACCOUNTABILITY THE DATA

01:13:05.447 --> 01:13:07.149
ALSO SHOWS THAT BLACK AMERICANS

01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:08.484
ARE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST AT

01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:10.152
EVERY STAGE OF THE JUSTICE

01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:12.855

01:13:22.064 --> 01:13:24.700
BAIL AND GIVEN 35% HIGHER BAIL

01:13:24.767 --> 01:13:26.769
AMOUNTS WHEN IT IS GRANTED WE

ARE GIVEN 25% LONGER SENTENCE

01:13:29.471 --> 01:13:31.140
FOR THE SAME CRIME. WE ARE THE

01:13:31.206 --> 01:13:32.741
MAJORITY OF THOSE SERVING LIFE

01:13:32.808 --> 01:13:35.144

01:13:36.912 --> 01:13:39.648
UP 40% OF THOSE BEHIND BARS AND

01:13:39.715 --> 01:13:41.817
ARE FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO

01:13:41.884 --> 01:13:44.820
BE ON PROBATION AND PAROLE AND

01:13:44.887 --> 01:13:47.389
WE REMAIN ON PROBATION PAROLE.

01:13:47.456 --> 01:13:48.423

01:13:50.559 --> 01:13:51.860
HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT BLACK

01:13:51.927 --> 01:13:54.363
PEOPLE ARE NO MORE PREDISPOSED

01:13:54.429 --> 01:13:56.565
TO CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR THAN ANY

01:13:56.632 --> 01:13:59.368
OTHER RACE. WE HAVE A REAL

01:13:59.434 --> 01:14:01.236
BLIND SPOTS WHEN IT COMES TO

01:14:01.303 --> 01:14:02.504
THE JUSTICE SYSTEM BECAUSE IT

01:14:02.571 --> 01:14:06.041
IS BASED ON FEAR AND CLASS AND

01:14:06.108 --> 01:14:09.211
RACE. AND WE NEED TO OWN THE

01:14:09.278 --> 01:14:11.380
FACT THAT WE LIKE TO PUNISH BUT

01:14:11.446 --> 01:14:13.348
PUNISHMENT IS NOT WHAT JOHN

01:14:13.415 --> 01:14:16.185
AUGUSTA'S HAD IN MIND. WHEN HE

01:14:16.251 --> 01:14:19.321

01:47:29.109 --> 01:47:30.911
ECONOMIC CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE

FAMILIES LIKE MINE ARE ON EDGE

01:47:53.433 --> 01:47:55.268

THERE ARE FAMILIES. WHO ARE.

01:48:07.013 --> 01:48:08.181

01:48:24.264 --> 01:48:27.500
ABLE TO STAY. AT HOME. THE LAST

01:48:27.567 --> 01:48:31.872
WEEK. WE KNOW THE- MOST

FAMILIES MY CAR'S CAN'T GO TO

01:48:36.042 --> 01:48:39.679

01:48:56.429 --> 01:48:57.631
SURE THAT WE PRESERVE. THOSE

01:48:57.697 --> 01:49:00.567
SLOTS. BECAUSE PEOPLE SHOULDN'T

01:49:00.634 --> 01:49:02.202

01:49:02.269 --> 01:49:03.770
CARE OF THEIR CHILDREN. WE'RE

01:49:03.837 --> 01:49:09.276
GOING TO WORK. THIS IS I

01:49:09.342 --> 01:49:10.110
IMAGINE THE FIRST BUDGET OF

01:49:10.176 --> 01:49:12.545
MANY TOUGH BUDGETS OVER THE

01:49:12.612 --> 01:49:15.048
NEXT COUPLE YEARS. SO THERE ARE

01:49:15.115 --> 01:49:17.350
CHOICES WE MADE THAT WORD

01:49:17.417 --> 01:49:19.386
PREFERABLE. WAS A LIKE LAST

01:49:19.452 --> 01:49:20.887
YEAR'S BUDGET BECAUSE WE TALKED

01:49:20.954 --> 01:49:21.621

01:49:24.958 --> 01:49:25.458
THE RAINY DAY FUND HOW MANY

01:49:25.525 --> 01:49:27.093
RESERVISTS WE HAD. WELL I THINK

01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:28.828
IT SEEMS THAT TODAY THE RAINY

01:49:28.895 --> 01:49:32.098
DAY HAS ARRIVED. SO THAT MONEY

01:49:32.165 --> 01:49:34.334
THAT. WE HAVE WORKED

01:49:34.401 --> 01:49:36.336
COLLECTIVELY AS THE LEGISLATURE

01:49:36.403 --> 01:49:38.872

01:49:38.939 --> 01:49:41.408
THAT MONEY. THIS FOLLY BEING

01:49:41.474 --> 01:49:45.045

MORE THAN EVER. SO WE SHOULDN'T

01:50:02.128 --> 01:50:03.663
AS AN INSTITUTION AS A STATE

01:50:03.730 --> 01:50:07.033

CUTS IN HEALTHCARE. I WOULD

01:51:13.099 --> 01:51:14.868
RATHER DO THAT THE MAKE SURE

01:51:14.934 --> 01:51:16.002
THAT THERE WEREN'T CHILDCARE

01:51:16.069 --> 01:51:18.571

IMPORTANTLY. THIS BUDGET

01:52:50.330 --> 01:52:52.565

CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE TO PLAY

HERE IN PARTNERING WITH THE

01:53:19.225 --> 01:53:21.261
EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO OVERSEE

01:53:21.327 --> 01:53:22.128
THAT SPEED SPENDING I'D LIKE TO

01:53:22.195 --> 01:53:23.963
COMMEND. OUR CHAIRMAN THE

01:53:24.030 --> 01:53:25.565
GENTLEMAN FROM SAN FRANCISCO

01:53:25.632 --> 01:53:27.233
AND OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE

01:53:27.300 --> 01:53:28.568
SENATE FOR HOLDING THE LINE ON

01:53:28.635 --> 01:53:31.337
THIS. AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO

01:53:31.404 --> 01:53:33.039
EXPRESS MY HOPE THAT WE WILL

01:53:33.106 --> 01:53:34.440
CONTINUE TO HOLD THE LINE AS

01:53:34.507 --> 01:53:36.109
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOVERNOR

01:53:36.176 --> 01:53:38.711
PROCEED. HOWEVER I ALSO HAVE

01:53:38.778 --> 01:53:39.312
SOME GREAT CONCERNS WITH THIS

01:53:39.379 --> 01:53:41.481
BUDGET. FIRST OF ALL THIS

01:53:41.548 --> 01:53:43.449
BUDGET APPROPRIATES MONEY TO

01:53:43.516 --> 01:53:45.185
THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD FOR THE

01:53:45.251 --> 01:53:46.519
PURPOSE OF MAKING STRUCTURAL

01:53:46.586 --> 01:53:47.587
CHANGES TO THE CAP INJURY

01:53:47.654 --> 01:53:49.289
PROGRAM. THESE CHANGES WOULD

01:53:49.355 --> 01:53:51.257
RAISE THE PRICE OF ENERGY IN

01:53:51.324 --> 01:53:53.092
CALIFORNIA TO INCREASE TAXES ON

01:53:53.159 --> 01:53:55.361
CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES. AND WHEN

01:53:55.428 --> 01:53:57.764
WE HEARD. THIS ITEM IN BUDGET

01:53:57.830 --> 01:53:59.065
COMMITTEE IT WAS VERY

01:53:59.132 --> 01:54:00.667
DISTURBING TO ME TO LEARN THAT

01:54:00.733 --> 01:54:02.402
MANY PEOPLE THE END OF THE

01:54:02.468 --> 01:54:03.870
ADMINISTRATION OF VIEW THE

01:54:03.937 --> 01:54:05.038
PURPOSE OF THE CAP AND TRADE

01:54:05.104 --> 01:54:06.973
PROGRAM TO RAISE REVENUE WHICH

01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:08.241
WE ALL KNOW IT IS NOT THE

01:54:08.308 --> 01:54:10.143
PURPOSE OF CAP AND TRADE. IS TO

01:54:10.210 --> 01:54:11.244
REGULATE THE EMISSION OF

01:54:11.311 --> 01:54:14.280
GREENHOUSE GASES IN CALIFORNIA

01:54:14.347 --> 01:54:16.683
REVENUE IS AN ANCILLARY BENEFIT.

01:54:16.749 --> 01:54:18.384
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY I BELIEVE

01:54:18.451 --> 01:54:20.386
THAT THIS BUDGET. IS

01:54:20.453 --> 01:54:22.622
STRUCTURALLY IRRESPONSIBLE WE

01:54:22.689 --> 01:54:24.958
HAVE A FIFTY FOUR BILLION

01:54:25.024 --> 01:54:25.558
DOLLAR BUDGET DEFICIT TO CLOSE

01:54:25.625 --> 01:54:28.394
THIS YEAR. THIS BUDGET CLOSES

01:54:28.461 --> 01:54:30.330
THAT THROUGH WHAT CAN ONLY BE

01:54:30.396 --> 01:54:31.664
CHARITABLY DESCRIBED AS

01:54:31.731 --> 01:54:34.701
BUDGETARY GIMMICKS. IT USES

01:54:34.767 --> 01:54:36.102
OVER TEN BILLION DOLLARS OF

01:54:36.169 --> 01:54:37.637
DEFERRALS WHICH IS MERELY

01:54:37.704 --> 01:54:39.806
SAYING THAT THIS YEAR'S BUDGETS

01:54:39.872 --> 01:54:41.374
ALL ITEMS ARE GOING TO BE PAID

01:54:41.441 --> 01:54:42.775
ONE YEAR INTO NEXT YEAR SO THAT

01:54:42.842 --> 01:54:44.277
WE CAN SAY THAT THEIR NEXT

01:54:44.344 --> 01:54:45.178
YEAR'S ITEMS INSTEAD OF THIS

01:54:45.245 --> 01:54:46.679
YEAR'S SPENDING. THAT'S A

01:54:46.746 --> 01:54:48.881
RESPONSIBLE. THIS BILL THIS

01:54:48.948 --> 01:54:50.717
ABOUT BUDGET BILL HAS BILLIONS

01:54:50.783 --> 01:54:52.252
AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF

01:54:52.318 --> 01:54:54.220
BORROWING. WHICH WE ARE

01:54:54.287 --> 01:54:55.355
CONSTITUTIONALLY PROHIBITED

01:54:55.421 --> 01:54:57.023
FROM DOING BUT WHAT THIS BUDGET

01:54:57.090 --> 01:54:58.758
DOES IS IT BORROWS FROM

01:54:58.825 --> 01:55:00.560
RESTRICTED FUND BALANCES

01:55:00.627 --> 01:55:01.828
TRANSFERS THAT MONEY INTO THE

01:55:01.894 --> 01:55:04.097
GENERAL FUND WITH THE PROMISED

01:55:04.163 --> 01:55:05.865
REPAIRED. LATER WITH INTEREST.

01:55:05.932 --> 01:55:07.600
THE PROBLEM WITH THAT THINKING.

01:55:07.667 --> 01:55:08.835
IS THAT EVERYBODY THE

01:55:08.901 --> 01:55:09.669
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S THE

01:55:09.736 --> 01:55:11.471
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALL OF

01:55:11.537 --> 01:55:12.839
OUR BUDGET CONSULTANTS EVERYONE

01:55:12.905 --> 01:55:14.340
AGREES THAT THIS IS A MULTI

01:55:14.407 --> 01:55:16.175
YEAR BUDGET EVENT. WE'RE GOING

01:55:16.242 --> 01:55:17.510
TO HAVE ANOTHER STRUCTURAL

01:55:17.577 --> 01:55:19.245
DEFICIT TO DEAL WITH NEXT YEAR.

01:55:19.312 --> 01:55:21.180
AND ANY SPENDING THAT WE MAKE

01:55:21.247 --> 01:55:23.449
THISYEAR WE PUT OFF REPAYMENT

01:55:23.516 --> 01:55:24.617
OF THAT TO FUTURE YEARS IT'S

01:55:24.684 --> 01:55:25.885
JUST GONNA MAKE THE PROBLEM

01:55:25.952 --> 01:55:27.720
BIGGER FUTURE YEARS FROM NOW.

01:55:27.787 --> 01:55:29.455
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WE HAVE

01:55:29.522 --> 01:55:31.891
NOT CUT GOVERNMENT SPENDING BY

01:55:31.958 --> 01:55:34.594
HARDLY AT ALL. OF THAT FIFTY

01:55:34.661 --> 01:55:37.397
FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN DEFICIT.

01:55:37.463 --> 01:55:38.698
EVEN IN THE WORST CASE SCENARIO

01:55:38.765 --> 01:55:40.099
WOULD WE GET NO MONEY FROM THE

01:55:40.166 --> 01:55:41.034
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE'RE

01:55:41.100 --> 01:55:42.769
CUTTING STATE SPENDING IN THIS

01:55:42.835 --> 01:55:44.003
BUDGET BY LESS THAN EIGHT

01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:45.071
BILLION DOLLARS. YOU DO THE

01:55:45.138 --> 01:55:46.773
MATH THAT MEANS THAT WE HAVE

01:55:46.839 --> 01:55:48.775
BALANCED THE BUDGET 85% WITH

01:55:48.841 --> 01:55:51.311
GIMMICK. 15% WITH ACTUAL

01:55:51.377 --> 01:55:52.445
REDUCTIONS TO STATE GOVERNMENT

01:55:52.512 --> 01:55:54.514
SPENDING AND COLLEAGUES I KNOW

01:55:54.580 --> 01:55:56.249
IT'S DIFFICULT TO HAVE OCCURRED

01:55:56.316 --> 01:55:57.483
CONVERSATION ABOUT CUTTING

01:55:57.550 --> 01:55:59.385
FUNDING. IT'S DIFFICULT TO TALK

01:55:59.452 --> 01:56:00.920
ABOUT WHAT FUNDS WE SHOULD

01:56:00.987 --> 01:56:03.356
REDUCE SPENDING ON. BUT WE ARE

01:56:03.423 --> 01:56:04.424
THE ADULTS IN THE ROOM IT IS

01:56:04.490 --> 01:56:05.825
OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP

01:56:05.892 --> 01:56:07.026
THOSE DISCUSSIONS BECAUSE IF WE

01:56:07.093 --> 01:56:08.695
DON'T HAVE THEM THIS YEAR.

01:56:08.761 --> 01:56:10.029
WE'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO

01:56:10.096 --> 01:56:11.964
MAKE EVEN MORE PAINFUL CUTS IN

01:56:12.031 --> 01:56:14.334
THE FUTURE. FOR THAT REASON I

01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:18.171
ORIGINAL VOTE. THINK OF A

01:56:18.237 --> 01:56:20.773
SHOWING OF CA MR LEVINE. YOU

01:56:20.840 --> 01:56:23.810

FOUR WE ARE EXTRAORDINARILY

01:56:29.882 --> 01:56:33.619
CLEAR EYED. IN OUR APPROACH TO

01:56:33.686 --> 01:56:35.788
THIS YEAR'S BUDGET THAT THIS AS

01:56:35.855 --> 01:56:37.457
MY COLLEAGUE SAID FROM BIG BIG

01:56:37.523 --> 01:56:39.058
BEAR SAID COULD BE A MULTI

01:56:39.125 --> 01:56:42.328
YEAR. BUDGET EVENT THIS IN FACT

01:56:42.395 --> 01:56:45.498
COULD BE A MULTI BUDGET EVENT

01:56:45.565 --> 01:56:46.265
YEAR. TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE

01:56:46.332 --> 01:56:48.368
THE STEWARDS THAT OUR SCHOOLS

01:56:48.434 --> 01:56:49.669
AND PROGRAMS THAT MILLIONS OF

01:56:49.736 --> 01:56:52.405
CALIFORNIANS DEPEND UPON. AND

01:56:52.472 --> 01:56:54.273
WHILE IT WOULD BE EASY TO SAY.

01:56:54.340 --> 01:56:55.575
THAT THIS ISN'T THE BUDGET THAT

01:56:55.641 --> 01:56:57.210
WE WANT TO PASS OR I DIDN'T RUN

01:56:57.276 --> 01:56:58.945
FOR OFFICE TO PASS BUDGETS LIKE

01:56:59.011 --> 01:57:01.381
THIS. AS SOMEONE WHO FIRST

01:57:01.447 --> 01:57:02.815
SERVED IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:57:02.882 --> 01:57:04.817
DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. HOW

01:57:04.884 --> 01:57:08.187
TO CUT MID YEAR. THE STAFF THAT

01:57:08.254 --> 01:57:09.622
I KNEW AND THE SERVICES THAT

01:57:09.689 --> 01:57:10.790
THEY WERE PROVIDING THAT PEOPLE

01:57:10.857 --> 01:57:12.792
DEPENDED UPON. AND I SAW THAT

01:57:12.859 --> 01:57:16.362
FIRST HAND. THIS IS PRECISELY

01:57:16.429 --> 01:57:19.031
WHY I RAN FOR THE ASSEMBLY.

01:57:19.098 --> 01:57:21.367
THIS IS A TEST FOR US. IN EIGHT

01:57:21.434 --> 01:57:26.072
YEARS LATER. AFTER SOCKING AWAY

01:57:26.139 --> 01:57:28.241
SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS INTO

01:57:28.307 --> 01:57:30.243
THE RAINY DAY OR RIVER RESERVES.

01:57:30.309 --> 01:57:32.345
WE ARE PASSING THIS TEST WHEN

01:57:32.412 --> 01:57:34.547
WE PASS THIS BUDGET. THE

01:57:34.614 --> 01:57:35.982
OUTLOOK IS MURKY WHETHER YOU'RE

01:57:36.048 --> 01:57:37.950
A FAMILY BUSINESS OR ANY

01:57:38.017 --> 01:57:39.685
GOVERNMENT AROUND THE WORLD

01:57:39.752 --> 01:57:44.090
RIGHT NOW. AND SO WHEN WE PASS

01:57:44.157 --> 01:57:45.892
THIS BUDGET TODAY WE KNOW THAT

01:57:45.958 --> 01:57:49.128
WE HAVE. EXERCISE THE

01:57:49.195 --> 01:57:51.264
DISCIPLINE AND THE STORE CHIP

01:57:51.330 --> 01:57:53.433
THAT WAS ASKED OF US WHEN THOSE

02:17:28.607 --> 02:17:29.441
OF THE POPULATION BUT THEY

02:17:29.507 --> 02:17:34.980
NEARLY TECH TEN OF THE THAT. WE

02:17:35.046 --> 02:17:35.513
LOOK AT THE NUMBERS RALLY

02:17:35.580 --> 02:17:38.416
COUNTY THE CITY OF A LOT OF MY

02:17:38.483 --> 02:17:43.221
IN AFTER ONE OF THE. THESE

02:17:43.288 --> 02:17:44.422
COMMUNITIES FIRST AND IS THAT

02:17:44.489 --> 02:17:46.491
THE MOST IMPACTED WE DON'T JUST

02:17:46.558 --> 02:17:47.392
SAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE

02:17:47.459 --> 02:17:48.293
DOING EQUAL CUTS ACROSS THE

02:17:48.360 --> 02:17:49.628

02:17:49.694 --> 02:17:51.129
EQUITABLE AND I'M FREE TO

02:17:51.196 --> 02:17:51.696
COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE THAT

02:17:51.763 --> 02:17:54.132
OCCURRED ARE. BEING BURDEN

02:17:54.199 --> 02:17:55.867
DISPROPORTIONATELY MICHAEL THAT.

02:17:55.934 --> 02:17:56.735
AND IF YOU THINK OF HEALTH CARE

02:17:56.801 --> 02:17:58.136
WILL HAVE TO BE THINKING ABOUT

02:17:58.203 --> 02:17:59.871
THEIR THAT WE BREATHE. AND THE

02:17:59.938 --> 02:18:01.339
REALITY IS THAT A LOT OF FOLKS

02:18:01.406 --> 02:18:02.574
ARE DATING MY COMMUNITY. NOT

02:18:02.641 --> 02:18:03.775
JUST COULD BECAUSE WE LACK

02:18:03.842 --> 02:18:05.143
ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. BUT

02:18:05.210 --> 02:18:08.213
BECAUSE WE'RE CONSTANTLY THE-

02:18:08.279 --> 02:18:08.747
REALLY BAD HARMFUL AIR OUT

02:18:08.813 --> 02:18:11.616
THERE. AND SO WE KNOW THAT

02:18:11.683 --> 02:18:12.784
BROWN AND BLACK PEOPLE ARE MORE

02:18:12.851 --> 02:18:14.519
LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN LIVE IN

02:18:14.586 --> 02:18:16.121
HIGHLY POLITICAL- COMMUNITIES.

02:18:16.187 --> 02:18:19.324
REFLECT RECENT HARVARD STUDY.

02:18:19.391 --> 02:18:20.558
THE PEOPLE THAT CALL IN

02:18:20.625 --> 02:18:21.893
NINETEEN WHO LIVE IN THE U. S.

02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:22.661
REGIONS WITH THE HIGHEST LEVEL

02:18:22.727 --> 02:18:24.396
OR POLLUTION. I'M MORE LIKELY

02:18:24.462 --> 02:18:26.898
TO DIE FROM THE DISEASE THAT

02:18:26.965 --> 02:18:27.399
PEOPLE WHO LIVE AND LESS

02:18:27.465 --> 02:18:29.134
POLLUTED AREAS. WITH THE CITY

02:18:29.200 --> 02:18:30.068
OF THE LORD AT NEW THAT'S IN

02:18:30.135 --> 02:18:32.103
THE 5% MOST POLLUTED. AIR OF

02:18:32.170 --> 02:18:35.340
THE STATE IT'S REALLY SCARY.

02:18:35.407 --> 02:18:36.675
COMPOUNDING IT ALREADY- ON.

02:18:36.741 --> 02:18:38.410
OVER BURDEN AND MEDICALLY

02:18:38.476 --> 02:18:40.812
UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY. AND SO

02:18:40.879 --> 02:18:42.447
WE WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN

02:18:42.514 --> 02:18:44.582
PROGRAMS LIKE AV SIX SEVENTEEN

02:18:44.649 --> 02:18:45.450

02:18:46.685 --> 02:18:48.953
DRIVEN ACTION PLANS. THIS YEAR

WE ARE MAKING A MODEST

02:18:50.455 --> 02:18:50.789
INVESTMENT IN THE

02:18:50.855 --> 02:18:53.158
IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT PROGRAM

02:18:53.224 --> 02:18:54.459
BUT THE REALITY IS THAT WHEN

02:18:54.526 --> 02:18:55.760
YOU START LOOKING FOR TO STAY

02:18:55.827 --> 02:18:57.262
NOBLE STORES OF FUNDING I

ENSURE THAT WE ARE REALLY

02:18:59.531 --> 02:19:01.433

02:19:15.180 --> 02:19:16.981
SLOWLY BUT I HOPE AFTER ALL

02:19:17.048 --> 02:19:18.616
THESE YEARS WE- HURRY UP AND WE

INVESTED IN HERE TOGETHER. IT

02:27:53.030 --> 02:27:54.999
REALLY COMES DOWN TO VALUES. SO

02:27:55.066 --> 02:27:56.767
I'D LIKE TO START BY SAYING I

02:27:56.834 --> 02:27:59.437
AM GRATEFUL TO THOSE OF YOU WHO

02:27:59.503 --> 02:28:02.006
PLACED A VALUE ON SAVINGS. IN

02:28:02.073 --> 02:28:03.674
PRIOR LEGISLATIVE SESSIONS.

02:28:03.741 --> 02:28:05.376
THAT ARE PROVIDED A RAINY DAY

02:28:05.443 --> 02:28:07.678
FUND FOR US TO DRAW FROM. TO BE

02:28:07.745 --> 02:28:10.047
ABLE TO BALANCE THE NEEDS OF

02:28:10.114 --> 02:28:12.216
OUR PUBLIC. IN THIS MOMENT OF

02:28:12.283 --> 02:28:15.253
CRISIS AND TO KEEP CUTS FROM

02:28:15.319 --> 02:28:16.988
BEING AS EXTREME AS THEY MIGHT

02:28:17.054 --> 02:28:18.789
HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN. I AM

02:28:18.856 --> 02:28:21.392
GRATEFUL FOR THAT. WE VALUE A

02:28:21.459 --> 02:28:22.893
BALANCED BUDGET IN CALIFORNIA

02:28:22.960 --> 02:28:25.796
IS NOT ONLY REQUIRED OF US BUT

02:28:25.863 --> 02:28:27.565
WE KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF NOT

02:28:27.632 --> 02:28:29.166
IN DOWN DEBT. TO THE

02:28:29.233 --> 02:28:30.868
GENERATIONS WHO COME AFTER THE

02:28:30.935 --> 02:28:32.403
US AND THAT IS EQUALLY

02:28:32.470 --> 02:28:34.772
IMPORTANT. AND AS THE

02:28:34.839 --> 02:28:36.574
OPPOSITION HAS RISEN AND SAID I

02:28:36.641 --> 02:28:38.609
DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS AS A

02:28:38.676 --> 02:28:41.178
MEMBER. ABOUT PROCESS IN THIS

02:28:41.245 --> 02:28:44.081
BODY. AND I REGRET THAT I WON'T

02:28:44.148 --> 02:28:47.051
BE HERE IN FUTURE SESSIONS TO

02:28:47.118 --> 02:28:48.886
SPEAK TO THAT. BECAUSE I DO

02:28:48.953 --> 02:28:49.687
THINK THERE IS MORE WORK WE

02:28:49.754 --> 02:28:52.690
COULD DO TO BE DELIVERED OF.

02:28:52.757 --> 02:28:55.026
ABOUT CUTS WE CAN MAKE AN ABOUT

02:28:55.092 --> 02:28:57.161
GROWTH TO GOVERNMENT THAT IS

02:28:57.228 --> 02:28:59.730
MEANINGFUL AND WORTHWHILE AND

02:28:59.797 --> 02:29:02.833
WORTH THE INVESTMENT. BUT

02:29:02.900 --> 02:29:04.935
FINALLY IN TAKING THIS VOTE.

02:29:05.002 --> 02:29:05.903
THE REASON THAT I GOT INTO

02:29:05.970 --> 02:29:08.005
GOVERNMENT TO BEGIN WITH. WAS

KEY ELEMENTS OF GOVERNMENT ARE

OPEN FOR BUSINESS. SUCH AS OUR

02:34:03.233 --> 02:34:04.935
PUBLIC SCHOOLS WE DID HAVE TO

02:34:05.002 --> 02:34:06.103
MAKE SOME TOUGH CHOICES IN THIS

02:34:06.170 --> 02:34:07.538
BUDGET WE HAD TO MAKE SOME CUTS

02:34:07.605 --> 02:34:09.773
FROM. PRIOR INVESTMENTS AND

02:34:09.840 --> 02:34:11.075
EXPANSIONS OF THINGS LIKE

TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT WE

02:34:14.778 --> 02:34:16.513
EXPANDED LAST YEAR EVEN THE

02:34:16.580 --> 02:34:18.716
JANUARY BUDGET WE HAD TO PULL

02:34:18.782 --> 02:34:19.883
BACK TO MAKE SURE WE CAN PROP

02:34:19.950 --> 02:34:21.919
UP. THE EXISTING PRIORITIES IN

02:34:21.986 --> 02:34:24.188
THE STATE BUDGET. BECAUSE LET'S

02:34:24.254 --> 02:34:25.422
FACE IT. IN THIS CALL THE

02:34:25.489 --> 02:34:26.590
NINETEEN WORLD. OUR SCHOOLS

02:34:26.657 --> 02:34:28.792
PROBABLY NEED MORE TO DO WHAT

02:34:28.859 --> 02:34:32.863
THEY'RE DOING. NOT LESS. AND

02:34:32.930 --> 02:34:35.866
UNFORTUNATELY IN THE MAY REVISE

02:34:35.933 --> 02:34:36.500
WE SAW HERE SCHOOLS WOULD HAVE

02:34:36.567 --> 02:34:38.769
BEEN HAVING A 10% COTTON. BASE

02:34:38.836 --> 02:34:40.771
FUNDING. AND THAT WOULD HAVE

02:34:40.838 --> 02:34:44.141
MADE IT NOT. RELIABLE FOR.

02:34:44.208 --> 02:34:46.276
SCHOOL FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS TO

02:34:46.343 --> 02:34:48.612
OPEN WHEN MADE SCHOOL BOARDS

02:34:48.679 --> 02:34:51.081
HAVE. DECISIONS LAYING OVER THE

02:34:51.148 --> 02:34:54.184
DAHLE TEACHER IT THE TOPIC THE

02:34:54.251 --> 02:34:56.220
FIGHT THERE IS. A BIG. I THINK

02:34:56.286 --> 02:34:56.920
LIKE THE LOWER LOSS OF THE

02:34:56.987 --> 02:35:00.491

HOW THOSE MONIES GO OUT IN THE

02:35:12.169 --> 02:35:14.071
LEARNING LOS BLOCK GRANT- WE

02:35:14.138 --> 02:35:16.173
THINK WE HAVE AN APPROACH THAT

02:35:16.240 --> 02:35:18.142
MAKES THE MOST SENSE TO IMPACT

02:35:18.208 --> 02:35:20.210
ALL SCHOOLS AND FOR THEM I KNOW

02:35:20.277 --> 02:35:21.779
THE GOVERNOR HAS IT BRING

02:35:21.845 --> 02:35:24.114
OPINION WHERE WE'RE GOING WITH

02:35:24.181 --> 02:35:25.015
THAT I MEAN FINANCE. WITH A

02:35:25.082 --> 02:35:27.685
SOLUTION THERE. THE LADY TO OUR

02:35:27.751 --> 02:35:29.053

THESE PROGRAMS ARE HANGING ON.

02:35:34.525 --> 02:35:36.827
BY A DEAR THREAD. AND SO HAVING

02:35:36.894 --> 02:35:38.996
A 10% CUT IN FUNDING FOR OUR

02:35:39.063 --> 02:35:40.464
CHILD CARE AND AFTER SCHOOL

02:35:40.531 --> 02:35:42.800
PROGRAMS ARE ACES. WOULD BE-

02:35:42.866 --> 02:35:44.501
THE DEATH OF THESE PROGRAMS NOT

02:35:44.568 --> 02:35:46.270
ONLY IMPACTS BROWNLEE WOMEN

02:35:46.336 --> 02:35:48.772

A NORMAL HOURLY JOB. FOR THAT

03:20:27.382 --> 03:20:28.616
REASON WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE A

03:20:28.683 --> 03:20:30.385

NEED TO USE THE RESTROOM. I

03:20:46.634 --> 03:20:47.635
THINK THAT THAT'S A COMMON

03:20:47.702 --> 03:20:50.037

TO ADDRESS THE VERY DIFFICULT

03:48:47.513 --> 03:48:49.015
FINANCIAL SITUATIONS THAT MANY

03:48:49.082 --> 03:48:50.383
CALIFORNIA FAMILIES ARE

03:48:50.450 --> 03:48:52.351
EXPERIENCING. THESE FAMILIES

03:48:52.418 --> 03:48:54.287
ARE STRUGGLING NOT DUE TO ANY

03:48:54.353 --> 03:48:56.355
FAULT OF THEIR OWN BUT DUE TO

03:48:56.422 --> 03:48:58.124
THE SPREAD OF A DANGEROUS VIRUS

03:48:58.191 --> 03:49:00.293
AND DUE TO THE NEEDED RESPONSE

03:49:00.359 --> 03:49:01.761
THAT WE HAVE TAKEN TO ADDRESS

03:49:01.828 --> 03:49:03.763
THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS.

03:49:03.830 --> 03:49:05.531
COLLECTIVELY WE HAVE MADE

03:49:05.598 --> 03:49:07.400
DECISIONS DECISIONS THAT WE

03:49:07.467 --> 03:49:08.835
UNDERSTAND ARE NECESSARY TO

03:49:08.901 --> 03:49:10.436
PROTECT THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIA

03:49:10.503 --> 03:49:12.338

AT HOME ORDERS AND RESTRICTING

03:49:15.341 --> 03:49:16.742
A BROAD RANGE OF ECONOMIC

03:49:16.809 --> 03:49:18.778
ACTIVITY. THESE RISKS SINCE

03:49:18.845 --> 03:49:19.979
HAVE SUCCEEDED REDUCING THE

03:49:20.046 --> 03:49:23.049
TRANSMISSION OF THE VIRUS BUT

03:49:23.116 --> 03:49:25.351
THEY ALSO CREATE VERY DIFFICULT

03:49:25.418 --> 03:49:26.986
FINANCIAL CHALLENGES FOR

03:49:27.053 --> 03:49:30.456
MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIA FAMILIES.

03:49:30.523 --> 03:49:31.757
THE LAST RECESSION. LIVING

03:49:31.824 --> 03:49:32.992
EXPENSES INCREASE MUCH FASTER

03:49:33.059 --> 03:49:34.260
AND WAGES AND CALIFORNIA

03:49:34.327 --> 03:49:35.461
HOUSEHOLDS ENTERED THIS

03:49:35.528 --> 03:49:37.296
PANDEMIC WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF

03:49:37.363 --> 03:49:41.534

CRISIS. THEY'RE HAVING TO COPE

03:49:48.341 --> 03:49:49.942
pWITH THIS TEMPORARY REALITY

03:49:50.009 --> 03:49:52.044
UNTIL WE CONTAIN THE VIRUS AND

03:49:52.111 --> 03:49:53.646
WE CAN SAFELY RETURN TO NORMAL

03:49:53.713 --> 03:49:55.915
ACTIVITIES. AS THEIR ELECTED

03:49:55.982 --> 03:49:58.151
REPRESENTATIVES WHAT ARE WE

03:49:58.217 --> 03:49:59.318
DOING NOW TO PREPARE FOR THE

03:49:59.385 --> 03:50:02.221
MONTHS AHEAD. EPIDEMIOLOGIST IN

03:50:02.288 --> 03:50:03.956
PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS WARN IS

03:50:04.023 --> 03:50:06.025
THAT THE SECOND WAVE MAY COME

03:50:06.092 --> 03:50:08.194
LATER THIS YEAR AND MAY REQUIRE

03:50:08.261 --> 03:50:10.263
ANOTHER ROUND OF STAY AT HOME

03:50:10.329 --> 03:50:11.697
ORDERS AND ECONOMIC

03:50:11.764 --> 03:50:14.433
RESTRICTIONS. THE WRITING IS ON

03:50:14.500 --> 03:50:16.936
THE WALL CALIFORNIA FAMILIES

03:50:17.003 --> 03:50:18.971
ARE FINANCIALLY STRUGGLING NOW

03:50:19.038 --> 03:50:21.507
AND EVEN MORE MAYBE STRUGGLING

03:50:21.574 --> 03:50:24.477
SIX MONTHS FROM NOW. AB TWENTY

03:50:24.544 --> 03:50:25.678
FIVE A ONE SIX TO PROVIDE THESE

03:50:25.745 --> 03:50:27.914
FAMILIES WITH TIME TO WEATHER

03:50:27.980 --> 03:50:30.383
THE STORM. THE BILL DOES NOT

03:50:30.449 --> 03:50:33.052
FOR GAVE OR CANCEL ANY DAY.

03:50:33.119 --> 03:50:34.921
INSTEAD IT REQUIES LENDERS TO

03:50:34.987 --> 03:50:37.290
OFFER FORBEARANCE OR A

03:50:37.356 --> 03:50:39.192
TEMPORARY DELAY IN MAKING

03:50:39.258 --> 03:50:41.594
PAYMENTS ON MORTGAGES CAR LOANS

03:50:41.661 --> 03:50:43.729
AND SMALL DOLLAR LOANS. AS WE

03:50:43.796 --> 03:50:45.264
EVENTUALLY LEARN HOW TO CONTAIN

03:50:45.331 --> 03:50:46.866
THE VIRUS THE BILL PROVIDES A

03:50:46.933 --> 03:50:48.534
PATHWAY BACK FOR CONSUMERS TO

03:50:48.601 --> 03:50:50.369
RESUME MAKING THEIR LOAN

03:50:50.436 --> 03:50:52.805
PAYMENTS. SO I THINK WE HAVE TO

03:50:52.872 --> 03:50:55.074
MAKE A CHOICE. DO WE TRUST

03:50:55.141 --> 03:50:57.109
EVERY FINANCIAL INSTITUTION AND

03:50:57.176 --> 03:50:59.011
OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO

03:50:59.078 --> 03:51:01.814
ALWAYS DO WHAT'S BEST FOR OUR

03:51:01.881 --> 03:51:02.915
CONSTITUENTS IN OUR COMMUNITIES.

03:51:02.982 --> 03:51:04.584
WHEN WE DID THAT LAST HOW DID

03:51:04.650 --> 03:51:06.018
IT WORK OUT FOR US WHEN THEY

03:51:06.085 --> 03:51:09.422
AWARDED THE PPP FUNDING. OR DO

03:51:09.488 --> 03:51:11.624
WE ESTABLISH THE SAFETY NET

03:51:11.691 --> 03:51:12.491
THAT PREVENTS PEOPLE FROM

03:51:12.558 --> 03:51:14.193
FALLING INTO FOR CLOSURES AND

03:51:14.260 --> 03:51:15.995
REPOSSESSIONS I COULD BE

03:51:16.062 --> 03:51:18.764
PREVENTABLE. THE FIRST APPROACH

03:51:18.831 --> 03:51:20.032
IS BASED ON TRICKLE DOWN

03:51:20.099 --> 03:51:22.168
ECONOMICS THE IDEA THAT IF WE

03:51:22.235 --> 03:51:23.436
MAKE SURE BUSINESSES ARE

03:51:23.502 --> 03:51:25.037
HEALTHY THEN THE BENEFITS WILL

03:51:25.104 --> 03:51:27.073
TRICKLE DOWN TO WORKERS AND

03:51:27.139 --> 03:51:29.342
CONSUMERS. THE OTHER APPROACH

03:51:29.408 --> 03:51:31.310
IS BASED FROM A BOTTOMS UP

03:51:31.377 --> 03:51:32.845
PERSPECTIVE HOW CAN WE PRO

03:51:32.912 --> 03:51:35.081
ACTIVELY HELP EVERY DAY PEOPLE

03:51:35.147 --> 03:51:36.649
SO THAT THEY HAVE THE FINANCIAL

03:51:36.716 --> 03:51:39.352
STABILITY AND WELL BEING TO

03:51:39.418 --> 03:51:39.885
CONTRIBUTE TO THE BROADER

03:51:39.952 --> 03:51:42.021
ECONOMY. I BROUGHT THIS BILL

03:51:42.088 --> 03:51:43.789
FORWARD PRIMARILY TO HELP

03:51:43.856 --> 03:51:46.325
FAMILIES. BUT THIS BILL IS ALSO

03:51:46.392 --> 03:51:48.194
ABOUT SETTING CALIFORNIA UP FOR

03:51:48.261 --> 03:51:50.796
AN ECONOMIC RECOVERY. CONSUMER

03:51:50.863 --> 03:51:54.433
SPENDING MAKES IT MORE THAN TWO

03:51:54.500 --> 03:51:57.270
THIRDS OF OUR ECONOMIES GDP.

03:51:57.336 --> 03:51:58.237
WITHOUT A HEALTHY CONSUMER

03:51:58.304 --> 03:52:00.406
THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS

03:52:00.473 --> 03:52:02.742
ECONOMIC RECOVERY. USING

03:52:02.808 --> 03:52:04.343
FINANCIAL TOOLS LIKE FOR

03:52:04.410 --> 03:52:06.279
PARENTS CAN OF AVOID

03:52:06.345 --> 03:52:07.747
UNNECESSARY FOR CLOSURES EVOKE

03:52:07.813 --> 03:52:09.215
SHINS DISPLACEMENT AND

03:52:09.282 --> 03:52:11.083
REPOSSESSIONS THAT WILL HARM

03:52:11.150 --> 03:52:12.718
OUR PUBLIC HEALTH EFFORTS TO

03:52:12.785 --> 03:52:15.655
DATE AND SLOW DOWN OUR ECONOMIC

03:52:15.721 --> 03:52:17.990
RECOVERY FOR THE FUTURE. BEFORE

03:52:18.057 --> 03:52:20.026
I WRAP UP MY OPENING REMARKS I

03:52:20.092 --> 03:52:21.627
WANT TO ADDRESS THE MYTH THAT

03:52:21.694 --> 03:52:23.529
HAVE BEEN FLOATING OUT THERE.

03:52:23.596 --> 03:52:25.064
THE MYTH BE SPREAD AROUND IS

03:52:25.131 --> 03:52:27.667
THAT THE IDEA THAT FORBEARANCE

03:52:27.733 --> 03:52:29.468
IS OFFERED. THAT A FLOOD OF

03:52:29.535 --> 03:52:32.438
PEOPLE WHO DO NOT NEED IT WILL

03:52:32.505 --> 03:52:33.606
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT ANYWAY. WE

03:52:33.673 --> 03:52:34.874
HAVE EVIDENCE FROM THIS

03:52:34.940 --> 03:52:36.676
EMERGENCY THAT THIS IS SIMPLY

03:52:36.742 --> 03:52:39.245
NOT TRUE. IN LATE MARCH

03:52:39.312 --> 03:52:41.314
CONGRESS PASSED THE CARES ACT

03:52:41.380 --> 03:52:41.881
WHICH PROVIDES MORTGAGE FOR

03:52:41.947 --> 03:52:44.817
PERRANCE UP TO ONE YEAR FOR

03:52:44.884 --> 03:52:46.585
FEDERALLY BACKED MORTGAGES. THE

03:52:46.652 --> 03:52:48.554
CARES ACT PROHIBITS A MORTGAGE

03:52:48.621 --> 03:52:50.656
SERVICER FROM REQUIRING ANY

03:52:50.723 --> 03:52:52.358
DOCUMENTATION FROM A BORROWED

03:52:52.425 --> 03:52:53.459
TO PROVIDE THEIR FINANCIAL

03:52:53.526 --> 03:52:55.661
HARDSHIP SO WE SHOULD EXPECT

03:52:55.728 --> 03:52:57.830
THAT MANY PEOPLE. WOULD HAVE

03:52:57.897 --> 03:52:59.632
TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THIS RIGHT.

03:52:59.699 --> 03:53:01.534
ACTUALLY THAT'S NOT THE CASE

03:53:01.600 --> 03:53:02.335
THE MORTGAGE BANKERS

03:53:02.401 --> 03:53:04.337
ASSOCIATION PUBLISHES DATA

03:53:04.403 --> 03:53:06.138
WEEKLY ABOUT THE PERCENTAGE OF

03:53:06.205 --> 03:53:07.707
MORTGAGES MORTGAGES AND

03:53:07.773 --> 03:53:09.775
FORBEARANCE THIS WEEK'S REPORT

03:53:09.842 --> 03:53:12.111
SHOWS THAT ONLY EIGHT POINT 5%

03:53:12.178 --> 03:53:15.214
OF MORTGAGES ARE IN FORBEARANCE.

03:53:15.281 --> 03:53:16.615
SO WE HAVE THE NATIONAL

03:53:16.682 --> 03:53:19.485
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AT 16% WE

03:53:19.552 --> 03:53:21.020
HAVE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SMALL

03:53:21.087 --> 03:53:22.121
BUSINESS OWNERS WHO ARE

03:53:22.188 --> 03:53:23.889
OPERATING AT REDUCED CAPACITY

03:53:23.956 --> 03:53:25.624
IF AT ALL. BUT THE FORBEARANCE

03:53:25.691 --> 03:53:27.560
RATE REMAINS IN THE SINGLE

03:53:27.626 --> 03:53:30.696
DIGIT PERCENTAGES THIRTY TELL

03:53:30.763 --> 03:53:32.698
US. IT TELLS ME THAT THE VAST

03:53:32.765 --> 03:53:33.833
MAJORITY OF HOMEOWNERS ARE

03:53:33.899 --> 03:53:36.235
STILL PAYING FOR THEIR MORTGAGE

03:53:36.302 --> 03:53:38.571
WHO CAN AFFORD IT EVEN THOSE

03:53:38.637 --> 03:53:39.839
HOMEOWNERS WHO HAVE SEEN THEIR

03:53:39.905 --> 03:53:41.741
INCOME GO DOWN ARE TIGHTENING

03:53:41.807 --> 03:53:43.409
THEIR BUDGETS. WE MUST ACT

03:53:43.476 --> 03:53:45.911
TODAY FOR CALIFORNIA FAMILIES

03:53:45.978 --> 03:53:51.016
AND. FOR EIGHTEEN BACK AND

03:53:51.083 --> 03:53:52.585
WAITING FOR CLOSURES

03:53:52.651 --> 03:53:54.086
REPOSSESSIONS AND PERMANENT

03:53:54.153 --> 03:53:57.523
DAMAGE TO CREDIT DOES NOT ALLOW

03:53:57.590 --> 03:53:58.557
FOR AN ECONOMY TO RECOVER.

03:53:58.624 --> 03:54:02.528
THANK YOU. THANK HIM AS A MOM

03:54:02.595 --> 03:54:04.363

03:54:10.503 --> 03:54:12.438
FIVE A ONE AND I HAVE TO SAY

03:54:12.505 --> 03:54:13.606
THERE ARE MANY THINGS IN THIS

03:54:13.672 --> 03:54:15.641
BILL I DON'T LIKE AND I'VE

03:54:15.708 --> 03:54:17.309
TALKED TO THE AUTHOR AT LENGTH

03:54:17.376 --> 03:54:19.612
ABOUT THE THINGS I LIKE AND

03:54:19.678 --> 03:54:20.312
WHAT I DON'T LIKE AND THE

03:54:20.379 --> 03:54:22.181
AUTHOR HAS PROMISED TO WORK

03:54:22.248 --> 03:54:24.784
WITH US TO GET TO A PLACE THAT

03:54:24.850 --> 03:54:28.154
PROTECTS. CONSUMERS WHO ARE

03:54:28.220 --> 03:54:30.589
AFFECTED BY DEFAULT YOUR

03:54:30.656 --> 03:54:34.126
BECAUSE THEY CANNOT WORK. IN A

03:54:34.193 --> 03:54:35.461
PROTECT THEIR CREDIT SO THAT

03:54:35.528 --> 03:54:37.396
WHEN WE ARE FACING A CONSUMER

03:54:37.463 --> 03:54:40.599
GOODS RECESSION IN A YEAR OR SO

03:54:40.666 --> 03:54:41.867
THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO CAN

03:54:41.934 --> 03:54:44.069
BUY. AND THAT IS THE POWER OF

03:54:44.136 --> 03:54:46.539
THIS BILL IS WE HAVE TO PROTECT

03:54:46.605 --> 03:54:49.141
OUR CONSTITUENTS FROM DEFAULTS

03:54:49.208 --> 03:54:51.010
BECAUSE OUR ECONOMY HAS BEEN

03:54:51.076 --> 03:54:53.078
SHUT DOWN. AND I THINK WHEN WE

03:54:53.145 --> 03:54:54.380
LOOK AT OUR ROLE OF GOVERNMENT

03:54:54.447 --> 03:54:56.682
AND WE LOOK AT HOW DO WE LEAVE

03:54:56.749 --> 03:54:58.250
THIS IS THE BILL THAT LEAVES.

03:54:58.317 --> 03:55:00.820
NOW I DON'T LIKE EVERYTHING THE

03:55:00.886 --> 03:55:02.755
BILL BUT I TRUSTS THE ASSEMBLY

03:55:02.822 --> 03:55:04.523
MEMBER FROM SANTA BARBARA. WHO
