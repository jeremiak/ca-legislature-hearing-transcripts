HE WAS ASSASSINATED AND THE LORRAINE MOTEL IF YOU HAVEN'T VISITED IS A GREAT- HISTORICAL SPOT OF FOR ALL THE WRONG REASONS BUT ONE THAT IS WORTH VISITING NONE THE LESS. AND IT'S SOMEWHAT IRONIC. MANY TIMES WHEN WE TALK ABOUT DOCTOR KING WE TALK ABOUT. ONE PARTICULAR SPEECH I HAVE A DREAM. BUT IF YOU'VE EVER LISTENED TO THAT SPEECH IN ITS ENTIRETY THAT WAS NOT TO SPEECH HE WAS GIVEN. HE WAS GIVING EACH ON THE URGENCY OF NOW ON A NATION. THAT IT MADE A PROMISE TO ALL PEOPLE BLOCK AS WELL AS WHITE. THE PROMISE OF FREEDOM AND THAT THIS NATION HAD. WROTE THE NEGRO. AYE INSUFFICIENT CHECK THAT IT FAILED TO LIVE UP TO THE PROMISE OF THE EMANCIPATION. PROCLAMATION AND HE STATED PATIENTS OF HIS GREAT WEALTH IS NOT BANKRUPT. BUT IT IS WHEN IT COMES TO THE NEGRO. AND IT IS A HUNDRED YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE MANSON PATIENT PROCLAMATION. OUR AIM MONUMENTOS DECREED CAME TO BE A GREAT BEACON OF LIGHT FOR MILLIONS OF NEGRO SLAVES WHO HAD BEEN SEARED BY THE FLAMES OF WITHERING INJUSTICE IT CAME AS A JOYOUS DAYBREAK TO THE END OF AT NIGHT. OF THEIR CAN CAPTIVITY. HUNDRED YEARS LATER THE NEGRO STILL NOT FREE. ONE HUNDRED YEARS LATER THE LIFE OF THE NEGRO IS STILL SADLY CRIPPLED BY THE MANACLES OF SEX SEGREGATION AND THE CHAINS OF DISCRIMINATION. ONE HUNDRED YEARS LATER THE NEGRO LIVES ON A LONELY ISLAND OF POVERTY IN THE MIDST OF VAST OCEANS A MATERIAL PROSPERITY ONE HUNDRED YEARS LATER THE NEGRO IS STILL LANGUISHING IN THE CORNERS OF AMERICAN SOCIETY. AND FINDS HIMSELF AN EXILE IN HIS WHOLE PLAN. SO WE COME HERE TODAY TO DRAMATIZE A SHAMEFUL CONDITIONS OF AMERICA AND I COULD GO ON. AND SPEAK TO THE FACT THAT AGAIN. AND IN A SENSE WE'VE COME TO THIS NATION TO CAP BACK CASH A CHECK. WHEN THE ARCHITECT OF THIS REPUBLIC WROTE THE MAGNIFICENT WORDS OF THE CONSTITUTION AND DECLARATIONS OF INDEPENDENCE THEY WERE SIGNING A PROMISSORY NOTE. TO WHICH EVERY AMERICAN FALLS HERE THIS NOTE WAS A PROMISE TO ALL MEN YES BLACK MEN AS WELL AS WHITE MEN THAT WOULD BE GUARANTEED AN AILING BUT WILL ALL RIGHTS OF LIFE LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS.

TELL ME ABOUT THE DREAM. ANY IMPROMPTU WENT TO IT WOULD TO A SPEECH CITY HAD GIVEN MANY TIMES ABOUT I HAVE A DREAM. BUT I ASKED YOU TO LEARN THE FIRST. MINUTES OF THAT SPEECH AND UNDERSTAND THAT HE SAYS. THE NEGRO IN NEW- IN THE SOUTH CANNOT VOTE. IN A **** YOUR DOES HE HAS NOTHING TO VOTE FOR. BLACK KIDS SEEING NEEDS OF WHITE ONLY A WHAT THAT MEANT TO THEM SO LET'S UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS ALL IN THAT SPEECH I ALSO ASK THAT WHEN YOU SING HAPPY BIRTHDAY MANY TIMES THIS WEEK I CELEBRATED A BIRTHDAY AND MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES CAME TO MY OFFICE AND I APPRECIATE THAT.
