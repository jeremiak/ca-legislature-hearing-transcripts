THE MORE ENERGY WE CAN PRODUCE

00:57:01.818 --> 00:57:03.586
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE

00:57:03.653 --> 00:57:04.854
LESS RELIANT WE WILL BE ON

00:57:04.921 --> 00:57:06.523
IMPORTED ENERGY FROM OUT OF

00:57:06.589 --> 00:57:08.958
STATE AND WE HAVE MAJOR. GRID

00:57:09.025 --> 00:57:11.528
RESILIENCY PROBLEMS EVEN TODAY.

00:57:11.594 --> 00:57:13.663
AND THAT IS WE'RE ONLY LESS

00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:14.798
THAN FOUR YEARS AWAY FROM

00:57:14.864 --> 00:57:16.766
LOSING AGAIN. THE LAST NUCLEAR

00:57:16.833 --> 00:57:18.568
PLANT WHICH IS 10% OF THE

00:57:18.635 --> 00:57:20.937
STATE'S POWER NOW TWENTY FOUR

00:57:21.004 --> 00:57:23.206
SEVEN THREE SIXTY FIVE. SO I

00:57:23.273 --> 00:57:25.275
THINK. IN TERMS OF INCREASING

00:57:25.341 --> 00:57:27.310
SUPPLY TO MATCH SUPPLY AND

00:57:27.377 --> 00:57:27.844
DEMAND AND KEEP THE GRID

00:57:27.911 --> 00:57:29.813
RESILIENCE I THINK. THAT

00:57:29.879 --> 00:57:31.614
ANYTHING WE DO TO PRODUCE OR

00:57:31.681 --> 00:57:33.783
STORE. MORE ELECTRONS IN THE

00:57:33.850 --> 00:57:35.552
STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE WERE WE

00:57:35.618 --> 00:57:36.553
ARE CONTRIBUTING TO GRID

00:57:36.619 --> 00:57:37.987
RESILIENCY WHICH WILL HELP KEEP

00:57:38.054 --> 00:57:40.123
COSTS DOWN BECAUSE- AS WE'VE

00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:42.559
LEARNED AND GOING BACK. TWENTY

00:57:42.625 --> 00:57:43.860
YEARS OR SO OR MAYBE NINETEEN

00:57:43.927 --> 00:57:45.028
YEARS WHATEVER IT WAS THE LAST

00:57:45.094 --> 00:57:47.030
ENERGY CRISIS I MEAN. WE CAN

00:57:47.096 --> 00:57:48.898
END UP AS A STATE AND A VERY

00:57:48.965 --> 00:57:51.935
BAD PLACE IF WE END UP. RELYING

00:57:52.001 --> 00:57:52.902
ON OUT OF STATE IMPORTED POWER

00:57:52.969 --> 00:57:55.505
BECAUSE- WE NEED TO COVER THAT

00:57:55.572 --> 00:57:57.974
LAST 1% AND THEN WE'RE AT THE

00:57:58.041 --> 00:57:58.942
MERCY OF WHATEVER SOMEBODY

00:57:59.008 --> 00:58:00.543
FROM. A PRODUCER FROM ANOTHER

00:58:00.610 --> 00:58:02.478
STATE ONCE ONCE THE CHARGER CAN

00:58:02.545 --> 00:58:04.113
LEGALLY CHARGE AND I DON'T WANT

00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:05.448
END UP BACK THERE AGAIN SO I

00:58:05.515 --> 00:58:07.083
SEE THIS AS- ACTUALLY

00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:09.452
SUPPORTIVE OF AG. AS AN

00:58:09.519 --> 00:58:11.721
INDUSTRY WHICH HAS A LARGE

00:58:11.788 --> 00:58:12.822
CONSUMER OF ENERGY IN A LARGE

00:58:12.889 --> 00:58:14.757
PURCHASER- BECAUSE I THINK IT

00:58:14.824 --> 00:58:16.459
WILL INCREASE OVER TIME FOR

00:58:16.526 --> 00:58:18.127
ABLE TO BUILD THIS OUT TO THE

00:58:18.194 --> 00:58:19.963
SCALE- WE'RE HOPING TO. IN

00:58:20.029 --> 00:58:20.864
TERMS OF OFFSHORE WIND

00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:22.432
GENERATION IT WILL CONTRIBUTE

00:58:22.498 --> 00:58:24.534
POSITIVELY TO GRID RELIABILITY

00:58:24.601 --> 00:58:28.104
AND HOLD PRICES DOWN THE LONG

00:58:28.171 --> 00:58:28.605

00:58:28.671 --> 00:58:31.641
OBSERVATION. THANK YOU SEEN ALL

00:58:40.617 --> 00:58:42.919

00:58:42.986 --> 00:58:44.854
ENGAGING WITH THE LARGE ENERGY

00:58:44.921 --> 00:58:47.257
CONSUMERS HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO

00:58:47.323 --> 00:58:48.191
DO SO I WANT TO JUST MAKE A FEW

00:58:48.258 --> 00:58:50.126
POINTS ON THAT- IF WE ARE

00:58:50.193 --> 00:58:52.729
SUCCESSFUL- THE IDEA IS THAT.

00:58:52.795 --> 00:58:55.398
AS OFFER WIND IS COMMERCIALIZED

00:58:55.465 --> 00:58:56.799
WE ARE EXPECTING ENERGY COSTS

00:58:56.866 --> 00:58:58.801
TO FALL SO OUR HOPE IS. AS WE

00:58:58.868 --> 00:59:00.336
MOVE THIS FORWARD COSTS WILL BE

00:59:00.403 --> 00:59:02.171
REDUCED WE ALSO KNOW THAT. WE

00:59:02.238 --> 00:59:03.439
NEED TO ADD OFFER WIND IS PART

00:59:03.506 --> 00:59:04.941
OF A DIVERSE PORTFOLIO SO THAT

00:59:05.008 --> 00:59:07.043
WE CAN STABILIZE- THE ENERGY

00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:10.046
SOURCES THAT WE HAVE- THERE WAS

00:59:10.113 --> 00:59:10.947
AN SB ONE HUNDRED JOINT AGENCY

00:59:11.014 --> 00:59:13.850

00:59:13.917 --> 00:59:15.685
WITHOUT OFFSHORE WIND. TOTAL

00:59:15.752 --> 00:59:18.354
ENERGY COSTS BECOME A BILLION

00:59:18.421 --> 00:59:19.656
DOLLARS MORE EXPENSIVE IN THE

00:59:19.722 --> 00:59:22.158
FUTURE- BECAUSE OF REASONS WE

00:59:22.225 --> 00:59:24.060
STATED BEFORE. GIVEN THE TIME

00:59:24.127 --> 00:59:25.561

01:11:30.519 --> 01:11:33.889
DIEGO. THIS IS A GOOD THING. A

01:11:33.956 --> 01:11:34.790
LOT OF POLITICIANS FROM JOE

01:11:34.857 --> 01:11:36.659
BIDEN THE GOVERNOR NEWSOM

01:11:36.725 --> 01:11:38.427
WONDER HOW WE ARE GOING TO

01:11:38.494 --> 01:11:40.362
TRANSITION FROM FOSSIL FUELS.

01:11:40.429 --> 01:11:42.464
TO CLEAN ENERGY JOBS. WELL IN

01:11:42.531 --> 01:11:44.667
BAKERSFIELD. THAT TRANSITION

01:11:44.733 --> 01:11:47.469
IT'S ALREADY HAPPENING. THAT IS

01:11:47.536 --> 01:11:49.338
UNLESS AB ELEVEN THIRTY NINE

01:11:49.405 --> 01:11:52.741
PASSES. NOW I WANT TO BE CLEAR

01:11:52.808 --> 01:11:56.345
I AM NOT AGAINST OIL JOBS I AM

01:11:56.412 --> 01:11:58.380
FOR SOLAR JOBS I THINK WE NEED

01:11:58.447 --> 01:12:00.082
TO TRANSITION TO CLEAN ENERGY.

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:01.517
BUT THE TRANSITION NEEDS TO BE

01:12:01.583 --> 01:12:03.686
STATIC IT NEEDS TO BE REAL AND

01:12:03.752 --> 01:12:05.054
IT NEEDS TO BE FELT THROUGHOUT

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:06.989
THE STATE. WE CAN'T HAVE OUR

01:12:07.056 --> 01:12:08.457
CALIFORNIA'S BALL FOR ROOFTOP

01:12:08.524 --> 01:12:10.092
SOLAR ONE DAY AND THEN THE NEXT

01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:12.261
DAY IF NOT. CALIFORNIA CAN'T BE

01:12:12.327 --> 01:12:13.662
PERSONAL WORK IN LIMITED

01:12:13.729 --> 01:12:15.831
SITUATIONS FOR NARROW SET OF

01:12:15.898 --> 01:12:18.567
CONSUMERS. EIGHTY ELEVEN THIRTY

01:12:18.634 --> 01:12:19.268
NINE O'CLOCK CALIFORNIA TO GO

01:12:19.334 --> 01:12:21.837
FROM BUILDING ONE HUNDRED AND

01:12:21.904 --> 01:12:22.504
FIFTY THOUSAND SOLAR ROOFS A

01:12:22.571 --> 01:12:25.874
YEAR. TO LESS THAN TWENTY

01:12:25.941 --> 01:12:26.442
THOUSAND. THIS WOULD NOT BE

01:12:26.508 --> 01:12:27.276
ENOUGH TO SUPPORT MY JOB I'M

01:12:27.342 --> 01:12:30.045
NOT SURE. WHAT CALIFORNIA HAS

01:12:30.112 --> 01:12:31.146
DONE THROUGH NET METERING

01:12:31.213 --> 01:12:32.748
DISCRETE CONSISTENT RULES FOR

01:12:32.815 --> 01:12:34.316
CONSUMERS BUSINESSES AND

01:12:34.383 --> 01:12:36.418
WORKERS TO PLAN AROUND THESE

01:12:36.485 --> 01:12:37.419
CONSISTENT RULES CAN BE

01:12:37.486 --> 01:12:39.288
CHANGED. BUT THE CHANGES NEED

01:12:39.354 --> 01:12:41.156
TO BE SLOW AND GRADUAL SO THERE

01:12:41.223 --> 01:12:42.157
IS TIME TO ADJUST TO GROW INTO

01:12:42.224 --> 01:12:44.560
THEM. AND THEY CAN'T BE

01:12:44.626 --> 01:12:46.562
RETROACTIVE. I THINK THAT IS

01:12:46.628 --> 01:12:48.497
WHAT BOTHERS ME THE MOST ABOUT

01:12:48.564 --> 01:12:49.698
EIGHTY ELEVEN THIRTY NINE. IT

01:12:49.765 --> 01:12:50.733
WOULD HAVE CALIFORNIA GO BACK

01:12:50.799 --> 01:12:52.067
ON HIS WORD TO THE PEOPLE WHO

01:12:52.134 --> 01:12:54.069
HAVE MADE THE INVESTMENT IN

01:12:54.136 --> 01:12:54.603
CLEAN ENERGY. AND YOU JUST

01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:56.638
CAN'T DO THAT. THE LAST POINT I

01:12:56.705 --> 01:12:57.906
WANT TO MAKE IT AROUND THE

01:12:57.973 --> 01:12:59.975
PURPORTED COST SHIFT. I CAN

01:13:00.042 --> 01:13:01.777
TELL YOU THAT THE VAST MAJORITY

01:13:01.844 --> 01:13:04.246
OF THE FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN

01:13:04.313 --> 01:13:05.547
KERN COUNTY BECAUSE CONSULAR.

01:13:05.614 --> 01:13:08.283
ARE NOT WEALTHY. THEY INVESTED

01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:09.618
IN SOLAR BECAUSE IT IS THE

01:13:09.685 --> 01:13:11.053
RIGHT THING TO DO AND BECAUSE

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:12.688
THEY ARE FED UP WITH P. GENIES

01:13:12.755 --> 01:13:16.658
PROBLEMS. THE WILDFIRES.

01:13:16.725 --> 01:13:19.128

ENERGY BILLS THEY WANT CHOICES

01:13:21.497 --> 01:13:23.966
THEY WANT SOLUTIONS. THAT PG&amp;E

01:13:24.032 --> 01:13:25.701
IS TRYING TO BLAMES COLOR USERS

01:13:25.768 --> 01:13:26.735
FOR THEIR PROBLEMS THAT THEY

01:13:26.802 --> 01:13:29.204
HAVE CREATED WILL BE LAUGHABLE

01:13:29.271 --> 01:13:31.273

01:14:19.087 --> 01:14:20.022
THREE YEARS OF MY LIFE

TRAVELING ACROSS THE COUNTRY

FOR MY DOCUMENTARY POWER TRIP.

01:14:22.991 --> 01:14:24.126
THAT EXAMINE THE WAR BETWEEN

FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY AND

01:14:25.828 --> 01:14:27.629
RENEWABLE ENERGY COMPANY AND I

01:14:27.696 --> 01:14:28.964
INTERVIEWED HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE

01:14:29.031 --> 01:14:30.966
FROM VARIOUS STATE EVERY WALK

01:14:31.033 --> 01:14:32.234
OF LIFE YOU CAN IMAGINE AND

01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:34.136
PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING SOME

01:14:34.203 --> 01:14:35.270
PEOPLE HAVE TO CHOOSE WHETHER

01:14:35.337 --> 01:14:37.372
OR NOT TO PAY THEIR POWER BILLS

01:14:37.439 --> 01:14:38.440
FOR TO PAY FOR FOOD ON THE

01:14:38.507 --> 01:14:40.008
TABLE FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND

01:14:40.075 --> 01:14:41.810
THAT IS CRAZY. THAT THAT'S

01:14:41.877 --> 01:14:43.846
HAPPENING IN AMERICA AND THERE

01:14:43.912 --> 01:14:44.646
ARE TWO THINGS THAT REALLY

01:14:44.713 --> 01:14:46.148
STOOD OUT TO ME ON A JOURNEY

01:14:46.215 --> 01:14:47.482
ONE IS THAT IN ENERGY IS BEING

01:14:47.549 --> 01:14:49.218
MADE INTENTIONALLY COMPLICATED

01:14:49.284 --> 01:14:51.019
WHEN IT DOES NOT NEED TO BE

01:14:51.086 --> 01:14:52.387
THERE ARE SOLUTIONS THAT WOULD

01:14:52.454 --> 01:14:53.722
BE GOOD FOR UTILITIES AND THEIR

01:14:53.789 --> 01:14:55.624
WORKERS AND THAT A VERY

01:14:55.691 --> 01:14:57.826
IMPORTANT THING IN CREATING NEW

01:14:57.893 --> 01:14:59.194
JOBS BUT ALSO PROTECTING THE

01:14:59.261 --> 01:15:01.029
JOB THAT WE ALREADY HAVE- BUT

01:15:01.096 --> 01:15:02.064
AT ALL QUICK TO BE GOOD FOR THE

01:15:02.130 --> 01:15:03.966
INDIVIDUAL ESPECIALLY LOW

01:15:04.032 --> 01:15:06.001
INCOME HOUSEHOLDS AND THE

01:15:06.068 --> 01:15:07.169
SECOND BIG THING THAT I

01:15:07.236 --> 01:15:08.604
DISCOVERED IS THAT THE REST OF

01:15:08.670 --> 01:15:09.671
THE COUNTRY LOOKED UP TO

01:15:09.738 --> 01:15:11.240
CALIFORNIA WHEN IT COMES TO

01:15:11.306 --> 01:15:12.674
RENEWABLE ENERGY. IT WAS

01:15:12.741 --> 01:15:13.809
AMAZING TO ME THAT THEY SAW

01:15:13.876 --> 01:15:15.577
CALIFORNIA IS A LEADER AND WHEN

01:15:15.644 --> 01:15:16.812
I MOVED TO CALIFORNIA I WAS

01:15:16.879 --> 01:15:18.113
PROUD TO BE A PART OF A STATE

01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:19.414
THAT HAD THAT KIND OF FORWARD

01:15:19.481 --> 01:15:21.884
THINKING I LIVED IN NEVADA AND

01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:22.651
I LIVED THROUGH THE NET

01:15:22.718 --> 01:15:25.354
METERING DISASTER IN THE NEVADA

01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:25.888
AND ONE OF THE VENGEFULLY

01:15:25.954 --> 01:15:28.323
OVERTURNED NEVER IN MY LIFE

01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:29.491
HAVE I SEEN A CATASTROPHIC

01:15:29.558 --> 01:15:30.592
RESPONSE TO APPEASE THE BAD

01:15:30.659 --> 01:15:32.060
LEGISLATION LIKE THAT THE

01:15:32.127 --> 01:15:34.663
PUBLIC OUTCRY WAS INCREDIBLE

01:15:34.730 --> 01:15:36.298
EVERYBODY FULLER CUSTOMERS AND

01:15:36.365 --> 01:15:37.666
NON CORE CUSTOMERS WERE UPSET

01:15:37.733 --> 01:15:38.901
BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THE IMPACT

01:15:38.967 --> 01:15:40.502
OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING. AND I

01:15:40.569 --> 01:15:41.837
THINK IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE GOING

01:15:41.904 --> 01:15:43.372
DOWN THE SAME PATH EXCEPT THE

01:15:43.438 --> 01:15:45.240
RESULT WILL BE EVEN WORSE

01:15:45.307 --> 01:15:46.541
BECAUSE PEOPLE EXPECTING

01:15:46.608 --> 01:15:48.610
CALIFORNIA THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:15:48.677 --> 01:15:49.411
FOLLOW POLICY THAT SUPPORT

01:15:49.478 --> 01:15:57.152
CLEAN AFFORDABLE ENERGY ACCESS.

01:15:57.219 --> 01:15:58.453
FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS- COMMITTEE

01:15:58.520 --> 01:15:59.721
CRICKET BUILD LUMPING TO. THAT

01:15:59.788 --> 01:16:00.455
THINGS THAT SHOULD NOT BE DEALT

01:16:00.522 --> 01:16:01.456
WITH TOGETHER. THERE IS AN ECHO

01:16:10.165 --> 01:16:10.632
THREAT IT WOULD ACTUALLY

01:16:10.699 --> 01:16:12.367
EXACERBATE THE ISSUE. AND

01:16:12.434 --> 01:16:14.002

EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE PROGRAMS

01:50:38.431 --> 01:50:40.333

THEIR COST I KNOW THAT I WAS AN

01:51:58.344 --> 01:52:00.680
EARLY ADOPTER. OF SOLAR AND

01:52:00.747 --> 01:52:03.750
REALLY DID RELY ON THEM TO.

WOULD BE. DISTANCING ALSO KNOW

01:52:12.692 --> 01:52:15.428
THAT- IN A VERY LATE VERSION OF

01:52:15.495 --> 01:52:18.531
THE BILL. THERE WAS A THERE WAS

01:52:18.598 --> 01:52:20.266

ABOUT. THAT STRUCK THE PART

01:52:24.637 --> 01:52:25.872
THAT SAYS CUSTOMER SIDE TO

01:52:25.939 --> 01:52:27.107
RENEWABLE ENERGY MUST GROW

01:52:27.173 --> 01:52:29.375
SUSTAINABLY. AND I'M HOPING

01:52:29.442 --> 01:52:31.978

WERE WILLING TO WORK ON THOSE

01:52:45.558 --> 01:52:46.092
TWO PROVISIONS I THINK THIS IS

01:52:46.159 --> 01:52:47.894
A BILL THAT I COULD. SUPPORT TO

01:52:47.961 --> 01:52:49.762

TAKE A LOOK ON THE FLOOR TO SEE

01:52:52.899 --> 01:52:56.169

HERE- AT CUSTOMERS I DO

01:53:10.016 --> 01:53:12.719
UNDERSTAND I'M ALSO SOLAR AT.

01:53:12.785 --> 01:53:14.587
CUSTOMER IN FACT MY CONTRACTOR

01:53:14.654 --> 01:53:16.222
CALLED TWICE IT SOUNDED LIKE-

CONTRACTOR IN CALIFORNIA

01:55:02.195 --> 01:55:04.230
CONSIDERING HIS COMMENTS ON OUR

01:55:04.297 --> 01:55:06.799
STATE. LET ME CONTINUE ON WITH

01:55:06.866 --> 01:55:09.235
MY COMMENTS I- I WROTE AN

01:55:09.302 --> 01:55:11.437
ORIGINAL BILL- RELATED TO NET

01:55:11.504 --> 01:55:13.373
ENERGY MEETING LAST YEAR WHICH

01:55:13.439 --> 01:55:15.174
WE HELD ECAUSE OF COLD IT AND

01:55:15.241 --> 01:55:16.409
HAVE BEEN JUST COMPLETELY

01:55:16.476 --> 01:55:19.512
STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT THIS AT

01:55:19.579 --> 01:55:21.147
THE NET ENERGY METERING HAS NOT

01:55:21.214 --> 01:55:23.449
BEEN RESTRUCTURED. UP FOR

01:55:23.516 --> 01:55:24.917
SEVERAL YEARS NOW GIVEN THAT

01:55:24.984 --> 01:55:26.586
THE CALIFORNIA PC HAD THE

01:55:26.653 --> 01:55:28.354
OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO AND HAS

01:55:28.421 --> 01:55:31.124
NOT DONE SO- THIS BILL DOES NOT

01:55:31.190 --> 01:55:33.192
KILL SOLAR ENERGY THAT'S A

01:55:33.259 --> 01:55:35.728
COMPLETE FALSEHOOD- AND I WOULD

01:55:35.795 --> 01:55:36.929
SAY THAT NOW MORE THAN EVER

01:55:36.996 --> 01:55:38.665
POLICYMAKERS AND REGULATORS

01:55:38.731 --> 01:55:41.000
ALIKE HAVE AN OBLIGATION. TO

01:55:41.067 --> 01:55:42.168
ENSURE THAT WE ARE PURSUING OUR

01:55:42.235 --> 01:55:43.670
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOALS

01:55:43.736 --> 01:55:45.872
AND TRANSITIONING 21100% CLEAN

01:55:45.938 --> 01:55:47.540
ENERGY IN A MATTER THAT

01:55:47.607 --> 01:55:48.941
ACHIEVES A MAXIMUM BENEFIT OF

01:55:49.008 --> 01:55:50.043
THE LEASE AND THE LEASE

01:55:50.109 --> 01:55:51.744
POSSIBLE COSTS FOR CUSTOMERS

01:55:51.811 --> 01:55:53.379
THE CURRENT STRUCTURE FOR NAM

01:55:53.446 --> 01:55:54.947
FAILS TO ACHIEVE THAT OBJECTIVE

01:55:55.014 --> 01:55:56.616
BECAUSE IT MANDATES THAT

01:55:56.683 --> 01:55:58.384
UTILITIES PURCHASE EXCESS POWER

01:55:58.451 --> 01:55:59.585
GENERATED FROM ROOFTOP SYSTEMS

01:55:59.652 --> 01:56:01.587
THAT ARE. AT A RATE ROUGHLY

01:56:01.654 --> 01:56:03.956
FIVE TIMES HIGHER THAN A CAN BE

01:56:04.023 --> 01:56:05.558
PURCHASED ANOTHER SOURCES

01:56:05.625 --> 01:56:07.060
EVERYBODY BENEFITS FROM OF THE

01:56:07.126 --> 01:56:08.494
ENERGY GRID AND EVERYBODY

01:56:08.561 --> 01:56:09.996
SHOULD PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE AND

01:56:10.063 --> 01:56:11.097
THAT'S NOT CURRENTLY THE

01:56:11.164 --> 01:56:12.332
REALITY AND THAT'S NOT THE

01:56:12.398 --> 01:56:14.200
REALITY OF EQUITY IN ENERGY A

01:56:14.267 --> 01:56:16.235
STRONG RELIABLE ELECTRICAL GRID

01:56:16.302 --> 01:56:18.638
IS CRITICAL TO ALL ELECTRICITY

01:56:18.705 --> 01:56:20.673
CUSTOMERS ALSO HAVE. SOLAR AT

01:56:20.740 --> 01:56:22.442
HOME AND THOSE WHO DON'T AND

01:56:22.508 --> 01:56:23.543
HOWEVER THE CURRENT AD

01:56:23.609 --> 01:56:25.478
TERRIBLE L. SOLAR CUSTOMERS TO

01:56:25.545 --> 01:56:27.213
BY PASS THESE MAINTENANCE COSTS

01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:28.448
IN ADDITION TO A PORTION OF

01:56:28.514 --> 01:56:30.450
PUBLIC PURPOSES PROGRAMS COST

01:56:30.516 --> 01:56:31.951
NAM TERRORISTS SHOULD NOT BE

01:56:32.018 --> 01:56:33.686
REGRESSIVE AND EXCESSIVE IN

01:56:33.753 --> 01:56:34.787
COMPARISON TO OTHER POLICY

01:56:34.854 --> 01:56:36.789
MANDATES THE MAGNITUDE OF THE

01:56:36.856 --> 01:56:39.459
ANNUAL NAMM KASHIF NOW EXCEEDS

01:56:39.525 --> 01:56:40.259
THAT OF THE CALIFORNIA

01:56:40.326 --> 01:56:42.028
ALTERNATIVE RATE FOR

01:56:42.095 --> 01:56:42.628
ELECTRICITY WHICH IS THE CARE

01:56:42.695 --> 01:56:44.731
PROGRAM. WHICH IS A SUBSIDY AT

01:56:44.797 --> 01:56:46.966
ABOUT A COST OF ONE BILLION AND

01:56:47.033 --> 01:56:50.536
IT HELPS. TWO POINT SEVEN

01:56:50.603 --> 01:56:51.237
MILLION VULNERABLE OWING SOME

01:56:51.304 --> 01:56:51.971
CUSTOMERS OF THE STATE.

01:56:52.038 --> 01:56:53.573
MEANWHILE JUST ABOUT NINE

01:56:53.639 --> 01:56:54.674
HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND

01:56:54.741 --> 01:56:55.942
CUSTOMERS RECEIVE SUBSIDIES FOR

01:56:56.008 --> 01:56:57.477
THEIR SOLAR SYSTEMS AND YET ARE

01:56:57.543 --> 01:56:59.212
RESPONSIBLE. FOR RAISING THE

01:56:59.278 --> 01:57:00.813
ENERGY RATES TO LOW AND MIDDLE

01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:02.815
INCOME CALIFORNIANS AT A COST

01:57:02.882 --> 01:57:05.585
OF ABOUT TWO BILLION ANNUALLY.

01:57:05.651 --> 01:57:07.653
THIS IS NOT A FORMULA BASED ON

01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:08.621
EQUITY NOR SHOULD IT BE A

01:57:08.688 --> 01:57:11.257
FORMULA AS PRAISED AS THE

01:57:11.324 --> 01:57:12.191
ANSWER TO THE FUTURE OF OUR

01:57:12.258 --> 01:57:14.560
STATE. ALL CALIFORNIANS SHOULD

01:57:14.627 --> 01:57:16.562
CONTRIBUTE EQUITABLY TOWARDS

01:57:16.629 --> 01:57:18.331
THE STATE'S CLEAN ENERGY GOALS

01:57:18.398 --> 01:57:19.232
AND CERTAINLY OUR MOST

01:57:19.298 --> 01:57:21.100
VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. SHOULD

01:57:21.167 --> 01:57:22.535
NOT BE EXPECTED TO CARRY THE

01:57:22.602 --> 01:57:24.470
LOAD FOR THOSE. WITH HIGHER

01:57:24.537 --> 01:57:26.272
INCOMES CLEAN ENERGY

01:57:26.339 --> 01:57:27.373

MADAM CHAIR AND- YOU KNOW I'VE

02:00:18.578 --> 02:00:19.946
I'VE LEARNED A LOT JUST BY

02:00:20.012 --> 02:00:22.114
READING ANALYSIS ON THIS BILL.

02:00:22.181 --> 02:00:24.517
AND THEM IS COMPLICATED AND I

02:00:24.584 --> 02:00:25.318
ALSO AM A ROOFTOP SOLAR

02:00:25.384 --> 02:00:28.020
CUSTOMER. AB BUT ONE OF THE

02:00:28.087 --> 02:00:29.355
THINGS THAT WAS MOST ARE DOING

02:00:29.422 --> 02:00:30.623
TO ME IN READING THIS ANALYSIS

02:00:30.690 --> 02:00:32.425
WITH THAT CHART. THEY LAID OUT

02:00:32.491 --> 02:00:33.559
THE AMOUNT OF COST SHIFTING

02:00:33.626 --> 02:00:34.894
THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST BUT

02:00:34.961 --> 02:00:35.995
ALSO WHAT WE PROJECT TO SEE IN

02:00:36.062 --> 02:00:37.063
THE FUTURE IN THE AMOUNT OF

02:00:37.129 --> 02:00:38.798
GROWTH IN COST SHIFTING. AND I

02:00:38.864 --> 02:00:39.899
DO REALLY WANT TO COMMEND THE

02:00:39.966 --> 02:00:42.935
AUTHOR- UNDER EFFORTS ON THIS

02:00:43.002 --> 02:00:44.403
BILL WHICH ARE. LARGEST NOT AN

02:00:44.470 --> 02:00:47.073
EASY EFFORT- TO REALLY LOOK AT

02:00:47.139 --> 02:00:48.207
THAT QUESTION BECAUSE WE SHOULD

02:00:48.274 --> 02:00:49.442
BE CAUTIOUS THING BETWEEN

02:00:49.508 --> 02:00:50.710
COMMUNITIES THEY COULD AFFORD

02:00:50.776 --> 02:00:52.478
SOLAR. AND THOSE THEY CANNOT

02:00:52.545 --> 02:00:54.113
OUR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THEY

02:00:54.180 --> 02:00:55.081
DON'T GET THE BENEFITS OF THIS

02:00:55.147 --> 02:00:57.383
PROGRAM. AND IT'S SOMETHING

02:00:57.450 --> 02:00:58.618
THAT THE PC SHOULD HAVE ALREADY

02:00:58.684 --> 02:01:00.353
DONE. YEAH AND I THINK IT'S

02:01:00.419 --> 02:01:01.053
IMPORTANT THAT WE SAY THAT HERE

02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:03.155
TODAY. THAT IS THE BODY WITH

02:01:03.222 --> 02:01:04.657
OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY OVER

02:01:04.724 --> 02:01:06.158
THE P. YOU SEE THEY HAVE FAILED

02:01:06.225 --> 02:01:07.159
TO DO WHAT THE AUTHOR IS TRYING

02:01:07.226 --> 02:01:08.794
TO DO TODAY. AND I THINK IT IS

02:01:08.861 --> 02:01:10.296
INCUMBENT UPON US TO URGE THEM

02:01:10.363 --> 02:01:12.331
TO DO IT. AND TO DO IT RIGHT

02:01:12.398 --> 02:01:12.898
THEY'RE THE ONES WITH THE

02:01:12.965 --> 02:01:15.534
EXPERTISE. TO DO THIS IN A WAY

02:01:15.601 --> 02:01:17.436
THAT MAKES SENSE. AND ONE OF MY

02:01:17.503 --> 02:01:18.938
CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL IS THAT

02:01:19.005 --> 02:01:20.439
ALTHOUGH I ABSOLUTELY LOVED.

02:01:20.506 --> 02:01:21.941
THE EFFORTS OF THE AUTHOR AND I

02:01:22.008 --> 02:01:23.609
THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE ALREADY

02:01:23.676 --> 02:01:24.810
READY AUTHOR WANTS US TO BE

02:01:24.877 --> 02:01:25.711
WHICH IS NOT SHIFTING THOSE

02:01:25.778 --> 02:01:27.580
COSTS. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO

02:01:27.647 --> 02:01:30.516
ME THAT- I SHERM MISTER TINGS.

02:01:30.583 --> 02:01:32.418
CONCERNS ABOUT THE STRIKING OF

02:01:32.485 --> 02:01:34.754
ENSURING. THAT CUSTOMER SITED

02:01:34.820 --> 02:01:36.689
RENEWABLES CONTINUES TO GROW

02:01:36.756 --> 02:01:37.690
SUSTAINABLY AND I UNDERSTAND

02:01:37.757 --> 02:01:38.791
WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM WITH

02:01:38.858 --> 02:01:40.192
THAT. BUT AS SOMEONE WHO

02:01:40.259 --> 02:01:42.228
REPRESENTS. A COMMUNITY WHERE

02:01:42.294 --> 02:01:43.529
WE ACTUALLY HAVE AN AREA THAT

02:01:43.596 --> 02:01:44.864
HAS SEEN A GROWTH IN SOLAR

02:01:44.930 --> 02:01:46.632
FARMS IN SOME OF THE LARGER.

02:01:46.699 --> 02:01:48.734
SOLAR INSTALLATIONS IT'S HARD

02:01:48.801 --> 02:01:50.102
TO GET THOSE DONE. THE

02:01:50.169 --> 02:01:51.337
PERMITTING IT'S HARD IT HAS TO

02:01:51.404 --> 02:01:53.205
BE NEAR. CONNECTIONS TO

02:01:53.272 --> 02:01:54.407
UTILITIES IN ORDER FOR IT TO

02:01:54.473 --> 02:01:55.441
PAN OUT WHICH ISN'T ALWAYS

02:01:55.508 --> 02:01:57.243
TRUE. THERE'S A LOT OF FIGHTS

02:01:57.309 --> 02:01:58.644
LIKE THE ONE WE SAW TODAY WITH

02:01:58.711 --> 02:01:59.912
THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY NOT

02:01:59.979 --> 02:02:01.380
WHEN YOU SEE THAT OPEN SPACE

02:02:01.447 --> 02:02:02.982
TURNED INTO A SOLAR FARM. AND

02:02:03.049 --> 02:02:04.684
IT WAS A RESULT OF ALL OF THAT.

02:02:04.750 --> 02:02:06.519
I THINK THAT ROOFTOP SOLAR HAVE

02:02:06.585 --> 02:02:09.221
TO BE A PART OF. OUR ANSWER TO

02:02:09.288 --> 02:02:11.557
GETTING TO A 1100% CLEAN FUTURE

02:02:11.624 --> 02:02:12.525
WHICH I KNOW THE AUTHOR AGREES

02:02:12.591 --> 02:02:13.926
WITH I KNOW SHE DOES NOT INTEND

02:02:13.993 --> 02:02:15.828
TO KILL ROOFTOP SOLAR NOR DOES.

02:02:15.895 --> 02:02:17.663
SHE BELIEVE THIS. THIS SAID SHE

02:02:17.730 --> 02:02:19.031
IS THAT BUT I DO THINK WE NEED

02:02:19.098 --> 02:02:21.300
A BALANCE BETWEEN. ELIMINATING

02:02:21.367 --> 02:02:22.401
THE COST SHIFTING WHICH IS

02:02:22.468 --> 02:02:24.103
UNACCEPTABLE AND ENSURING THAT

02:02:24.170 --> 02:02:26.472
WE ARE. INCENTIVIZING SOLAR

02:02:26.539 --> 02:02:28.474
SUIT ROOFTOP SOLAR SO CONTINUES

02:02:28.541 --> 02:02:30.209
TO GROW. AND I'M SORRY TO SEE

02:02:30.276 --> 02:02:31.277
THE PARTS OF THE BILL THAT

02:02:31.343 --> 02:02:32.578
INCENTIVIZE DID ESPECIALLY OUR

02:02:32.645 --> 02:02:34.180
LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES REMOVED

02:02:34.246 --> 02:02:35.881
I THOUGHT THAT WAS. A WONDERFUL

02:02:35.948 --> 02:02:36.816
EFFORT EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE

02:02:36.882 --> 02:02:37.950
TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY WHICH

02:02:38.017 --> 02:02:40.086
IS INCENTIVIZING. SOLAR SO I

02:02:40.152 --> 02:02:45.891
REALLY HOPE THAT WE GET TO A.

02:02:45.958 --> 02:02:46.559
PLACE WHERE THE P. C. DOES THIS.

02:02:46.625 --> 02:02:47.193
AND CHANGES THE DYNAMIC THAT IS

02:02:47.259 --> 02:02:47.860
ON A- TO. AND DOES IT IN A THEY

02:02:47.927 --> 02:02:49.228
CAN TO. SCHOOL THIS PART OF OUR

02:02:49.295 --> 02:02:51.831
RENEWABLE FUTURE TO. GROW AND

02:02:51.897 --> 02:02:54.266
THRIVE AND PROVIDE ENERGY IN

02:02:54.333 --> 02:02:54.867
THE WAY THAT DOES TODAY THANK

02:02:54.934 --> 02:02:59.872

APOLOGIZE MISTER MAYES. AS

02:03:07.313 --> 02:03:09.782
MICROPHONE UP. THINK ABOUT

02:03:09.849 --> 02:03:12.118
CHAIR SO I HAVE A LOTS OF

02:03:12.184 --> 02:03:13.619
QUESTIONS BECAUSE IT SEEMS

02:03:13.686 --> 02:03:15.621
LIKE- THIS THE BILL CAME UP-

02:03:15.688 --> 02:03:17.723
WAS SAVED GOD WELL IT WAS

02:03:17.790 --> 02:03:20.526
GUTTED- AND THERE'S- THERE'S

02:03:20.593 --> 02:03:24.730
NEW LANGUAGE I THINK- IN HERE-

02:03:24.797 --> 02:03:27.299
AND- SO I'M AND I'M KIND OF

02:03:27.366 --> 02:03:29.168
STRUGGLING FRANKLY. I WITH

02:03:29.235 --> 02:03:31.270
WHERE I'M AT ON THIS BECAUSE I

02:03:31.337 --> 02:03:33.072
DON'T LIKE THE COST OF EITHER-

02:03:33.139 --> 02:03:35.241
FACT THAT IS IT IS NOT AN

02:03:35.307 --> 02:03:38.010
OPINION IS A FACT- IT WAS A

02:03:38.077 --> 02:03:39.478
POLICY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

02:03:39.545 --> 02:03:41.313
TO SUBSIDIZE ROOFTOP SOLAR AT

02:03:41.380 --> 02:03:43.149
THE BEGINNING. A WHEN IT WAS IN

02:03:43.215 --> 02:03:45.484
ITS IN ITS INFANCY- IT IS NO

02:03:45.551 --> 02:03:48.320
LONGER IN ITS INFANCY- WHY DO

02:03:48.387 --> 02:03:49.288
WE KNOW THAT WE KNOW THAT

02:03:49.355 --> 02:03:50.656
BECAUSE IT'S THREE BILLION

02:03:50.723 --> 02:03:51.957
DOLLAR COST SHIFT AND WE JUST

02:03:52.024 --> 02:03:53.893
HEARD ALL OF THEM THE SPECIAL

02:03:53.959 --> 02:03:55.361
INTEREST GROUPS THAT HAVE

02:03:55.427 --> 02:03:58.964
FORMED- A THIRD TO PROTECT AT

02:03:59.031 --> 02:04:00.266
THIS PARTICULAR INDUSTRY AND OF

02:04:00.332 --> 02:04:02.601
COURSE. THAT'S WHAT YOU DO WHEN

02:04:02.668 --> 02:04:03.903
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUTTHREE

02:04:03.969 --> 02:04:06.005
BILLION THREE BILLION DOLLARS

02:04:06.071 --> 02:04:07.473
AT THE SAME TIME YOU KNOW I

02:04:07.540 --> 02:04:09.675
REPRESENT A DESERT A COMMUNITY

02:04:09.742 --> 02:04:12.444
WE HAVE AN AWFUL LOT OF ROOFTOP

02:04:12.511 --> 02:04:15.014
SOLAR IN MY DISTRICT A LOT OF

02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:16.282
ROOFTOP SOLAR AND IN THE

02:04:16.348 --> 02:04:18.818
SUMMERTIME. WE DON'T HAVE THE

02:04:18.884 --> 02:04:20.719
BENEFIT OF THAT SEA BREEZE I

02:04:20.786 --> 02:04:21.220
FOR SOME OF THE COASTAL

02:04:21.287 --> 02:04:22.888
COMMUNITIES AND YOU KNOW OUR

02:04:22.955 --> 02:04:25.057
ELECTRIC BILLS AREN'T TWO

02:04:25.124 --> 02:04:25.791
HUNDRED OR THREE HUNDRED

02:04:25.858 --> 02:04:27.860
DOLLARS A MONTH THEY ARE EIGHT

02:04:27.927 --> 02:04:28.928
HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH A

02:04:28.994 --> 02:04:30.162
THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH TWELVE

02:04:30.229 --> 02:04:31.363
HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. AND

02:04:31.430 --> 02:04:34.166
THIS SOLAR ENERGY IS- IS REALLY

02:04:34.233 --> 02:04:35.634
SOMETHING THAT IS- IS SO

02:04:35.701 --> 02:04:37.603
IMPORTANT JUST JUST FOR OUR

02:04:37.670 --> 02:04:39.338
LOCAL ECONOMY AND SO I'M

02:04:39.405 --> 02:04:40.806
STRUGGLING SORT OF BACK AND

02:04:40.873 --> 02:04:41.640
FORTH ON WHAT TO DO WITH THIS

02:04:41.707 --> 02:04:43.275
WHAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO

02:04:43.342 --> 02:04:44.543
BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT WE NEED

02:04:44.610 --> 02:04:46.378
TO ACTUALLY HAVE A REAL.

02:04:46.445 --> 02:04:48.113
CONVERSATION ABOUT IT SOMETHING

02:04:48.180 --> 02:04:49.682
HAS TO BE DONE WE CAN'T

02:04:49.748 --> 02:04:52.384
CONTINUE TO SUBSIDIZE- THIS-

02:04:52.451 --> 02:04:53.519
THIS IS NOT A INTO INDUSTRY

02:04:53.586 --> 02:04:55.487
LONG LONGER WE CAN'T CONTINUE

02:04:55.554 --> 02:04:56.989
TO SUBSIDIZE IT SO IF I CAN'T

02:04:57.056 --> 02:04:57.890
IF THERE'S SOMEBODY TO BE ABLE

02:04:57.957 --> 02:05:00.392
TO ANSWER- MAYBE A FEW A FEW

02:05:00.459 --> 02:05:04.163
QUESTIONS- ONE OF THEM- IS- ON

02:05:04.230 --> 02:05:05.364
I'M LOOKING AT PAGE SEVEN OF

02:05:05.431 --> 02:05:07.199
THE ANALYSIS WHERE IT TALKS

02:05:07.266 --> 02:05:12.371
ABOUT NAM ONE. POINT OH- IN TWO

02:05:12.438 --> 02:05:14.373
POINT OH- IT'S- THE LEGACY.

02:05:14.440 --> 02:05:15.241
FROM ONE POINT OH TO POINT OH

02:05:15.307 --> 02:05:16.442
THIS THREE POINT OH TERROR I

02:05:16.508 --> 02:05:18.043
DON'T KNOW THAT MEANS SO THE

02:05:18.110 --> 02:05:19.278
RATES THAT WERE PUT IN UNDER

02:05:19.345 --> 02:05:20.913
NAB ONE POINT OH ARE STILL IN

02:05:20.980 --> 02:05:22.848
EXISTENCE FOR THOSE- SOLAR

02:05:22.915 --> 02:05:24.250
CUSTOMERS THEY PROBABLY REAP

02:05:24.316 --> 02:05:27.019
THE BENEFITS BEYOND. IMAGINABLE

02:05:27.086 --> 02:05:29.188
AND GOTTEN THEIR MONEY BACK ON

02:05:29.255 --> 02:05:31.123
ON THE FULLER INSTITUTE TO. THE

02:05:31.190 --> 02:05:33.359
NEXT REITERATION WITH NUMBER

02:05:33.425 --> 02:05:34.793
TWO POINT NOW. THIS WOULD BE

02:05:34.860 --> 02:05:35.961
NUMBER THREE POINT OH TO

02:05:36.028 --> 02:05:37.263
RESTRUCTURE AGAIN THE RATES

02:05:37.329 --> 02:05:38.864
THAT IT AND HOW ARE CALCULATING

02:05:38.931 --> 02:05:40.266
THOSE RATES WHAT IT SAYS IS

02:05:40.332 --> 02:05:42.134
THOSE EARLIER CUSTOMERS. THE

02:05:42.201 --> 02:05:43.802
BILL NOW SAYS WILL EASE IN IN

02:05:43.869 --> 02:05:45.704
THE AGREEMENT I MADE JUST A FEW

02:05:45.771 --> 02:05:46.805
MINUTES GO WITH MISTER KING IS

02:05:46.872 --> 02:05:48.641
OVER TEN YEARS THEY WILL EASE

02:05:48.707 --> 02:05:51.343
INTO THESE NEW RATES SO. IF FOR

02:05:51.410 --> 02:05:53.245
IT. AND I'M A PERFECT EXAMPLE

02:05:53.312 --> 02:05:56.482
WE GOT SOLAR LAST YEAR- AND SO

02:05:56.548 --> 02:05:59.118
WE WERE STRUCTURING OUR HE BACK

02:05:59.184 --> 02:06:01.186
IF YOU WILL. BASED ON THE NAMM

02:06:01.253 --> 02:06:03.622
TWO POINT OH RATES IT WOULD

02:06:03.689 --> 02:06:05.457
ENSURE THAT I KEEP THOSE RATES

02:06:05.524 --> 02:06:06.392
FOR TEN YEARS SO WOULD BE PAID

02:06:06.458 --> 02:06:09.228
OFF- BEFORE YOU KNOW THE

02:06:09.295 --> 02:06:10.829
BIGGEST SUBSIDY WOULD BE GONE.

02:06:10.896 --> 02:06:12.131
THE PROBLEM IS ESPECIALLY WITH

02:06:12.197 --> 02:06:13.299
THE NO ONE POINT OH CUSTOMERS

02:06:13.365 --> 02:06:15.634
IS WE ARE OVER SUBSIDIZING.

02:06:15.701 --> 02:06:16.735
WHICH WE DIDN'T JUST

02:06:16.802 --> 02:06:18.570
INCENTIVIZE YOU KNOW THEY THEY

02:06:18.637 --> 02:06:20.539
PAY BACK THEIR SYSTEM. IN THERE

02:06:20.606 --> 02:06:22.875
NOT JUST GETTIN THEIR SAVINGS

02:06:22.942 --> 02:06:24.610
OF SOLAR THEY'RE GETTING-

02:06:24.677 --> 02:06:26.845
REALLY SUBSIDIZED ON THEIR

02:06:26.912 --> 02:06:28.714
PAYMENT TO THE GREAT AND THAT'S

02:06:28.781 --> 02:06:29.715
WHAT WE EVENTUALLY NEED TO GET

02:06:29.782 --> 02:06:31.417
AWAY FROM. SO MAYBE THE ONE

02:06:31.483 --> 02:06:32.818
OTHER WAY OF ASKING THIS

02:06:32.885 --> 02:06:34.386
QUESTION IS IF YOU ARE PUTTING

02:06:34.453 --> 02:06:36.388
ON A HUGE CAPITAL OUTLAY OUT

02:06:36.455 --> 02:06:38.424
YOUR SPENDING 300-004-0000

02:06:38.490 --> 02:06:40.459
WHATEVER THE AMOUNT IS. YOU

02:06:40.526 --> 02:06:41.827
MAKE THAT DECISION BASED UPON A

02:06:41.894 --> 02:06:44.263
PROMISE OR WHETHER THE CONTRACT

02:06:44.330 --> 02:06:46.231
WITH ITS IMPLIED OR NOT- THAT.

02:06:46.298 --> 02:06:47.733
IF I PUT THIS ON TODAY I AM

02:06:47.800 --> 02:06:49.234
GOING TO GET THIS BENEFIT

02:06:49.301 --> 02:06:51.403
COMING OUT ARE WE CHANGING-

02:06:51.470 --> 02:06:54.673
THAT DEAL- OR OR WHERE WHERE

02:06:54.740 --> 02:06:56.942
SEND SETTING OUT THAT DEAL SO

02:06:57.009 --> 02:06:58.544
NOBODY WILL BE IN A SITUATION

02:06:58.610 --> 02:07:00.946
WHERE IT DIDN'T MAKE. SENSE TO

02:07:01.013 --> 02:07:03.048
GET THE SOLAR THAT THEY LOST

02:07:03.115 --> 02:07:04.516
MONEY ON THE SOLAR WE'RE GOING

02:07:04.583 --> 02:07:06.385
TO PRESERVE THEIR ABILITY TO

02:07:06.452 --> 02:07:07.886
MAK MONEY ON THEIR SOLAR BUT

02:07:07.953 --> 02:07:09.388
THEY'RE GOING TO QUIT MAKING AS

02:07:09.455 --> 02:07:14.994
MUCH MONEY ON. THEIR SOLAR AT

02:07:15.060 --> 02:07:15.561
TEN YEARS FROM NOW. BECAUSE

02:07:15.627 --> 02:07:16.128
YOU'RE SAYING THAT THEY'VE

02:07:16.195 --> 02:07:16.929
ALREADY BEEN PAID BY. THE

02:07:16.996 --> 02:07:17.896
SYSTEMS ARE BE PAID BACK IN AS

02:07:17.963 --> 02:07:19.498
A THEY'RE MAKING MONEY. OFF OF-

02:07:19.565 --> 02:07:21.133
OFF THE TOP THE GRID HAVING TO

02:07:21.200 --> 02:07:23.035
BUY THEIR EXCESS SOLAR GET AND

02:07:23.102 --> 02:07:23.936
THEN THE OTHER OF MAYBE ONE

02:07:24.003 --> 02:07:25.771
OTHER QUESTION IF I CAN MADAM.

02:07:25.838 --> 02:07:28.240
MADAM CHAIR IS- UNDERSTANDING

02:07:28.307 --> 02:07:28.941
THAT THIS IS THE FIRST HEARING

02:07:29.008 --> 02:07:30.576
RIGHT THIS IS THE OF THE FIRST

02:07:30.642 --> 02:07:32.945
YEAR TO TWO YEAR SESSION. AND

02:07:33.012 --> 02:07:34.947
THERE ARE- BILLS THAT COME UP-

02:07:35.014 --> 02:07:36.181
AND WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THE

02:07:36.248 --> 02:07:38.150
IMPORTANCE OF HAVING A- REAL

02:07:38.217 --> 02:07:39.451
CONVERSATION AND REAL

02:07:39.518 --> 02:07:41.320
DISCUSSION. AND SOMETIMES THE

02:07:41.387 --> 02:07:43.555
LEGISLATURE HAS TO DO THINGS.

02:07:43.622 --> 02:07:45.858
TO MAKE OTHER AGENCIES- BEGIN

02:07:45.924 --> 02:07:47.192
TO WORK ITS WAY UNDER. I

02:07:47.259 --> 02:07:49.628
UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT IS US

02:07:49.695 --> 02:07:51.530
HAVING THIS BILL THIS VEHICLE

02:07:51.597 --> 02:07:53.766
TO CONTINUE TO MOVE. SO THAT WE

02:07:53.832 --> 02:07:55.367
CAN MAYBE FOR SOME OTHER AGENCY

02:07:55.434 --> 02:07:58.170
LIKE THE P. YOU SEE- TO- TO DO

02:07:58.237 --> 02:07:59.805
WHAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO DO.

02:07:59.872 --> 02:08:01.407
SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO ME

02:08:01.473 --> 02:08:02.341
HERE IS THAT THE WHOLE POINT OF

02:08:02.408 --> 02:08:04.176
THE COMMISSION. IS IT FOR TO BE

02:08:04.243 --> 02:08:05.944
NONPOLITICAL AND YET THEY FOUND

02:08:06.011 --> 02:08:06.445
THERE'S A LOT OF THESE

02:08:06.512 --> 02:08:08.013
COMMISSIONS. THAT ACTS A VERY

02:08:08.080 --> 02:08:10.015
POLITICAL- AND IF THE POLITICAL

02:08:10.082 --> 02:08:11.050
BODIES THE ONE IT'S ACTUALLY

02:08:11.116 --> 02:08:12.551
HAVING TO COME INTO FORCE. IN

02:08:12.618 --> 02:08:14.053
FORCES ACTUALLY UPSIDE THE

02:08:14.119 --> 02:08:15.387
UPSIDE DOWN OR BACKWARDS.

02:08:15.454 --> 02:08:16.655
THAT'S HOW IMPORTANT IS IT THAT

02:08:16.722 --> 02:08:18.524
THIS OF THIS VEHICLE MOVES SO

02:08:18.590 --> 02:08:20.459
IT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND- I

02:08:20.526 --> 02:08:21.994
THINK THAT IT WAS MADE EVEN

02:08:22.061 --> 02:08:23.529
MORE STRIKINGLY IMPORTANT BY

02:08:23.595 --> 02:08:24.630
THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS

02:08:24.696 --> 02:08:26.899
BECAUSE IT. DOESN'T IF YOU SEE

02:08:26.965 --> 02:08:28.767
ACCESS IT DOESN'T GO INTO

02:08:28.834 --> 02:08:29.935
EFFECT THEY CAN MAKE A NEW.

02:08:30.002 --> 02:08:31.870
RATE STRUCTURE- WE ARE JUST

02:08:31.937 --> 02:08:33.338

ACT IF YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO

02:08:34.273 --> 02:08:35.541
ACT WILL LEGISLATE ON IT

02:08:35.607 --> 02:08:36.842
OBVIOUSLY IT WOULD BE MORE

02:08:36.909 --> 02:08:42.548
APPROPRIATE FOR THE PC TO ACT.

02:08:42.614 --> 02:08:43.048

ECONOMY WE DO WE DO AND I TRIED

02:14:19.184 --> 02:14:20.185
TO PUT SOME OF THAT INTO THE

02:14:20.252 --> 02:14:22.654
BILL. THE COMMITTEE NOW SAYS

02:14:22.721 --> 02:14:24.289

SOME OF THE INCENTIVES ON THE

02:14:27.426 --> 02:14:28.927
OTHER. I DO THINK WE HAVE TO

02:14:28.994 --> 02:14:30.195
GET WE WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO

02:14:30.262 --> 02:14:32.264
INCENTIVIZE SOLAR- AND SOME

02:14:32.330 --> 02:14:34.199
POINTS FOR SOME CUSTOMERS FOR A

02:14:34.266 --> 02:14:35.967
VERY LONG TIME. THAT IS THAT IS

02:14:36.034 --> 02:14:37.235
A PROGRAM WE SHOULD BE WORKING

02:14:37.302 --> 02:14:40.472
ON AS WELL. BUT IT IS NOT-

02:14:40.539 --> 02:14:43.308
EQUITABLE IT IS NOT FAIR- TO

02:14:43.375 --> 02:14:45.644
CONTINUE TO HAVE. FOR EXAMPLE

02:14:45.710 --> 02:14:47.546
AND THE GERMANFROM NO LONGER

02:14:47.612 --> 02:14:48.380
FROM YUCAIPA PREVIOUSLY FROM

02:14:48.447 --> 02:14:50.782
YUCAIPA. WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE

02:14:50.849 --> 02:14:52.250
THOSE SUMMERTIME BILLS THINK

02:14:52.317 --> 02:14:54.186
ABOUT THIS THE SUMMERTIME BILLS

02:14:54.252 --> 02:14:56.254
WHEN YOU CAN'T AFFORD SOLAR.

02:14:56.321 --> 02:14:57.522
AND IT'S TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS

02:14:57.589 --> 02:15:00.592
A MONTH. IN RISING BECAUSE MORE

02:15:00.659 --> 02:15:01.927
PEOPLE ARE GETTING SOLAR AND

02:15:01.993 --> 02:15:03.628
SHIFTING THOSE COSTS TO YOU

02:15:03.695 --> 02:15:05.430
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG THERE.

02:15:05.497 --> 02:15:07.098
AND SO IT IS UP TO US TO TRY TO

02:15:07.165 --> 02:15:09.134
CORRECT IT. DESPITE SOME OF THE

02:15:09.201 --> 02:15:10.769
OPPOSITION'S COMMENTS I DON'T

02:15:10.836 --> 02:15:12.671

IS IT IS- TERROR LANGUAGE LIKE

02:15:20.879 --> 02:15:22.380
THAT THAT IS SCARING PEOPLE OUT

02:15:22.447 --> 02:15:24.182
OF COMMONSENSE REFORMS THAT CAN

02:15:24.249 --> 02:15:26.585

FROM FOR HIM THE OPPONENTS TO

02:15:45.203 --> 02:15:47.105
TRY TO DEAL WITH. THAT THERE'S

02:15:47.172 --> 02:15:49.107
PROBABLY. JUST THE PRICE OF

02:15:49.174 --> 02:15:50.475
LIVING IT IS PROBABLY THE

02:15:50.542 --> 02:15:52.210

LAST SUMMER WE SAW DRASTIC

02:33:17.888 --> 02:33:19.089
RESULTS OF THE FAILURES IN OUR

02:33:19.156 --> 02:33:21.225
SYSTEM WITH EIGHT HUNDRED

02:33:21.292 --> 02:33:21.825
THOUSAND HOMES AND BUSINESSES

02:33:21.892 --> 02:33:23.661
LOST POWER FULLER GLOBAL

02:33:23.727 --> 02:33:24.728
COMMUNITIES WERE LEFT IN THE

02:33:24.795 --> 02:33:25.529
DARK IN THE MIDDLE OF A

02:33:25.596 --> 02:33:28.098
PANDEMIC AT THE SAME TIME WE

02:33:28.165 --> 02:33:29.667
HAD ENOUGH ENERGY STORED IN

02:33:29.733 --> 02:33:30.935
BEHIND THE METER STORAGE OR IN

02:33:31.001 --> 02:33:33.170
OUR BATTERY SUPPLIES. TO SUPPLY

02:33:33.237 --> 02:33:34.505
COMMUNITIES WITH THE CRITICAL

02:33:34.572 --> 02:33:36.607
NEEDED POWER THE HORRIBLE

02:33:36.674 --> 02:33:37.775
BLACKOUTS WERE SYMPTOM OF

02:33:37.841 --> 02:33:39.476
LARGER ISSUES WITH HIGH DEMAND

02:33:39.543 --> 02:33:41.779
CALIFORNIA IS THE COUNTRY'S

02:33:41.845 --> 02:33:43.347
NUMBER ONE ENERGY IMPORTER A

02:33:43.414 --> 02:33:44.682
QUARTER OF OUR ENERGY IS

02:33:44.748 --> 02:33:46.684
IMPORTED FROM OUT OF STATE AND

02:33:46.750 --> 02:33:49.153
HIGH COST OF REPAIRS HOWEVER WE

02:33:49.219 --> 02:33:50.120
HAVE PLENTY OF ENERGY FROM

02:33:50.187 --> 02:33:52.022
SOLAR DURING THE DAY BUT NO

02:33:52.089 --> 02:33:53.691
ACCESS TO THAT ENERGY ONCE IT'S

02:33:53.757 --> 02:33:55.626
STORED IN BATTERIES AT NIGHT

02:33:55.693 --> 02:33:57.561
THERE IS NO NEED TO BUILD A NEW

02:33:57.628 --> 02:33:59.029
POWER PLANT- BY MORE ENERGY

02:33:59.096 --> 02:34:01.332
FROM UTAH AND COLORADO. WE HAVE

02:34:01.398 --> 02:34:03.000
THE ENERGY WE NEED SOARED IN

02:34:03.067 --> 02:34:04.368
THE THOUSANDS OF BATTERIES AT

02:34:04.435 --> 02:34:08.706
HOMES. AND BUSINESSES ACROSS

02:34:08.772 --> 02:34:09.773
CALIFORNIA. AB FOR TWENTY

02:34:09.840 --> 02:34:10.407
SIMPLY REQUIRES THE P. YOU SEE

02:34:10.474 --> 02:34:12.176
EACH DEVELOP REGULATIONS. TO

02:34:12.242 --> 02:34:14.745
FULLY UTILIZE THE RELIABLE

02:34:14.812 --> 02:34:15.446
CLEAN ENERGY STORED IN BEHIND

02:34:15.512 --> 02:34:16.914
THE METER BATTERIES. THESE

02:34:16.981 --> 02:34:18.182
BATTERIES WILL SHORE UP THE

02:34:18.248 --> 02:34:19.216
GRID AND OFFSET THE PRICE

02:34:19.283 --> 02:34:21.218
SPIKES. THAT AREPASSED ON TO

02:34:21.285 --> 02:34:22.820
RATEPAYERS AND I THINK THAT'S A

02:34:22.886 --> 02:34:23.921
REALLY IMPORTANT POINT WHEN WE

02:34:23.988 --> 02:34:25.255
HAVE THESE ENERGY SPIKES

02:34:25.322 --> 02:34:26.190
BECAUSE THERE IS A MASSIVE

02:34:26.256 --> 02:34:28.325
DEMANDED ENERGY. WE PAY THE

02:34:28.392 --> 02:34:30.027
HIGHEST COSTS FOR ENERGY TO

02:34:30.094 --> 02:34:31.629
IMPORTED FROM OUT OF STATE.

02:34:31.695 --> 02:34:32.796
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CHARTS OF

02:34:32.863 --> 02:34:33.664
WHAT WE WERE PAYING IN AUGUST

02:34:33.731 --> 02:34:35.532
FOR ENERGY. THAT IS CAUSING AN

02:34:35.599 --> 02:34:37.067
INCREASE IN RATES THAT ARE

02:34:37.134 --> 02:34:38.268
BEING PAID BY OUR CONSUMERS AND

02:34:38.335 --> 02:34:39.737
IF WE CAN DRIVE THAT COSTS DOWN

02:34:39.803 --> 02:34:40.804
BY USING BEHIND THE METER

02:34:40.871 --> 02:34:43.107
ENERGY. R. COSTA REPAIRS WILL

02:34:43.173 --> 02:34:45.476
GO DOWN. THE ENERGY NEWLY

02:34:45.542 --> 02:34:46.710
AVAILABLE WILL HELP PROTECT

02:34:46.777 --> 02:34:48.245
CALIFORNIA'S MOST BLACKOUTS AND

02:34:48.312 --> 02:34:49.780
THE REGULATIONS WILL LIKE CLEAN

02:34:49.847 --> 02:34:50.648

02:39:37.734 --> 02:39:38.502
IT WOULD ADVANCE BEHIND THE

02:52:33.676 --> 02:52:38.481
K. WHICH CREATES V. M. BUT

02:52:38.548 --> 02:52:39.882
CAPACITY VALUATION METHODOLOGY.

02:52:39.949 --> 02:52:41.884
INTERESTS ARE CONCERNED YOU

REPEAT. OKAY THE AMENDMENTS

02:52:50.193 --> 02:52:51.260
WHAT YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IS

02:52:51.327 --> 02:52:52.428
PART OF WHAT WE STRUCK FROM THE

02:52:52.495 --> 02:52:54.831
BATTLE HE DID STRIKE OUT OF THE

02:52:54.897 --> 02:52:58.134
WELL THAT'S GREAT- THAT MAKES

02:52:58.201 --> 02:52:58.835
THINGS A LOT MORE

02:52:58.901 --> 02:53:00.837
STRAIGHTFORWARD. THE OTHER

02:53:00.903 --> 02:53:04.607
CONCERN I HAVE IS. SO WE HEARD

02:53:04.674 --> 02:53:06.242
FROM THE SCHOOL AND THEY WANT

02:53:06.309 --> 02:53:07.810
THEIR BATTERY BECAUSE THEY WANT

02:53:07.877 --> 02:53:09.011
TO BE ABLE TO EDUCATE THEIR

02:53:09.078 --> 02:53:10.313
KIDS WHEN THERE'S A POWER SHOT

02:53:10.379 --> 02:53:12.215
OFF. AND THAT MAKES A LOT OF

02:53:12.281 --> 02:53:14.917
SENSE SO THEY MAY HAVE KIDS

02:53:14.984 --> 02:53:17.220
STARTING AT EIGHT OR NINE IN

02:53:17.286 --> 02:53:19.722
THE MORNING GOING TO THREE

02:53:19.789 --> 02:53:21.591
THIRTY THERE'S A POWER SHOT OFF.

02:53:21.657 --> 02:53:25.094
THE TIME WHEN YOU MOST NEED

02:53:25.161 --> 02:53:25.795
PEOPLE TO BRING DOWN THEIR

02:53:25.862 --> 02:53:28.131
LOADS IS WHAT'S CALLED THE

02:53:28.197 --> 02:53:31.067
NAKED ATTACK BUT BASICALLY IT'S

02:53:31.134 --> 02:53:33.102
A PERIOD WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN

02:53:33.169 --> 02:53:34.570
UNTIL AROUND SIX OR SEVEN AT

02:53:34.637 --> 02:53:37.173
NIGHT THAT'S WHEN THE LOW JUST

02:53:37.240 --> 02:53:39.842
GOES LIKE CRAZY. THE PROBLEM IS

02:53:39.909 --> 02:53:42.545
THE I SO WILL NOT KNOW THAT

02:53:42.612 --> 02:53:44.814
THAT BATTERY. WAS USED BY THE

02:53:44.881 --> 02:53:48.684
SCHOOL. OR PERHAPS IN THE WHOLE

02:53:48.751 --> 02:53:51.454
REGION THAT'S LOW ON POWER THEY

02:53:51.521 --> 02:53:53.923
HAVE A WHOLE POWER SHUT OFF IN

02:53:53.990 --> 02:53:56.893
THE ISO JUSTICE AGAIN NO THIS.

02:53:56.959 --> 02:54:00.329
BECAUSE THE ISO DOESN'T KNOW

02:54:00.396 --> 02:54:02.465
IT'S LIKELY TO SAY OVER FINE.

02:54:02.532 --> 02:54:03.800
WE HAVE ALL THESE BATTERIES

02:54:03.866 --> 02:54:06.035
THAT CAN COME ONLINE AND THEY

02:54:06.102 --> 02:54:09.872
CAN'T. SO THAT'S THAT'S THE

02:54:09.939 --> 02:54:11.674
SORT OF PRACTICAL CONSIDERATION

02:54:11.741 --> 02:54:13.476
