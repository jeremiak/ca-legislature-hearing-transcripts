00:47:51.268 --> 00:47:54.839 region:rollup2
LET ME TRY TO ADD A TACKLE THAT

00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:56.941 region:rollup2
THE TOP LINE HERE WHICH IS THERE

00:47:54.839 --> 00:47:58.542 region:rollup2
ARE REQUIREMENTS FOR MAINTAIN AS

00:47:56.941 --> 00:47:59.877 region:rollup2

QUESTION AROUND PRINT MEDIA WHAT

00:48:20.998 --> 00:48:23.934 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE DISTINCTIONS ARE BUT

00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:25.236 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT.

00:48:23.934 --> 00:48:27.438 region:rollup2
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT PIECE

00:48:25.236 --> 00:48:28.839 region:rollup2
OF THE BILL THAT DOESN'T.

00:48:27.438 --> 00:48:30.174 region:rollup2

SO IT'S EASY FOR PEOPLE TO READ

00:48:33.744 --> 00:48:36.180 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

00:48:34.712 --> 00:48:38.849 region:rollup2
FOR JOURNALISTS TO BE ABLE TO

00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:40.584 region:rollup2

INFLUENCE ADVERTISEMENT SO I

00:48:44.321 --> 00:48:47.291 region:rollup2
THINK THIS IS A KEY PIECE OF THE

00:48:46.056 --> 00:48:49.059 region:rollup2
BILL BUT I WILL LET TRENT

00:48:47.291 --> 00:48:50.494 region:rollup2

AT THANK YOU ARE ARMED YET THIS

00:48:52.563 --> 00:48:56.333 region:rollup2

WRITTEN DRAFT IS INTENDED TO BE

00:48:56.333 --> 00:49:00.237 region:rollup2
THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS THAT

00:48:57.968 --> 00:49:00.504 region:rollup2
HAVE TO KEEP THE THAT THE

00:49:00.237 --> 00:49:01.572 region:rollup2
DATABASE.

00:49:00.504 --> 00:49:03.107 region:rollup2
.

00:49:01.572 --> 00:49:05.709 region:rollup2
THE BILL REQUIRES THEM TO HAVE A

00:49:03.107 --> 00:49:06.877 region:rollup2
A LINK ON THEIR ON THAT SO THAT

00:49:05.709 --> 00:49:09.613 region:rollup2
THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM TO PUT

00:49:06.877 --> 00:49:11.148 region:rollup2

THEY DO THE LAYOUT PEOPLE

00:49:13.884 --> 00:49:17.521 region:rollup2
CONTENT BUT. FACEBOOK DOES THE

00:49:16.053 --> 00:49:19.990 region:rollup2
LAYOUT THAT WOULD GO TO THE

00:49:17.521 --> 00:49:21.292 region:rollup2
DATABASE OF ADS PAID FOR BY THE

00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:22.660 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE AGAIN THE SOCIAL MEDIA

00:49:21.292 --> 00:49:24.695 region:rollup2
PLATFORMS WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE

00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:26.864 region:rollup2
FOR THAT IN FACT FACEBOOK IS.

00:49:24.695 --> 00:49:29.567 region:rollup2
PROPOSING TO ROLLOUTS A A

00:49:26.864 --> 00:49:29.934 region:rollup2

00:49:31.936 --> 00:49:34.805 region:rollup2
FITS IN KIND RIGHT EXACTLY

00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:35.840 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THAT APPLIED TO ALL

SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS

00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:38.709 region:rollup2
IF NOT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

00:49:37.508 --> 00:49:40.277 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE TO KEEP THAT DATABASE

00:49:38.709 --> 00:49:41.612 region:rollup2
WOULD BE THIS RESPONSIBILITY THE

00:49:40.277 --> 00:49:43.581 region:rollup2
PLATFORM WHICH. FACEBOOK'S ARE

00:49:41.612 --> 00:49:45.850 region:rollup2
INTENDING TO DO.

00:49:43.581 --> 00:49:48.686 region:rollup2
SO ONE OF THE BIG QUESTIONS THAT

00:49:45.850 --> 00:49:49.987 region:rollup2
I HAVE IS.

00:49:48.686 --> 00:49:50.955 region:rollup2

THE VERSION IN PRINT HAS A

00:51:40.965 --> 00:51:44.335 region:rollup2
THRESHOLD THAT WAS TAKEN FROM

VOTING IN MISSION VIEJO. HOWEVER

01:27:26.808 --> 01:27:29.945 region:rollup2
IT ALSO SHOWS THAT DISTRICT

DILUTING THE MINORITY VOTES

01:28:04.412 --> 01:28:08.583 region:rollup2
HOWEVER AGAIN DISTRICT ELECTIONS

01:28:06.414 --> 01:28:10.385 region:rollup2

01:29:40.342 --> 01:29:43.311 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES IN THE LEGAL

01:29:41.543 --> 01:29:44.713 region:rollup2
STANDARDS ON FOR PREVAILING ON

01:29:43.311 --> 01:29:46.815 region:rollup2
CBR.

01:29:44.713 --> 01:29:48.783 region:rollup2

01:29:48.783 --> 01:29:52.287 region:rollup2
THREE OF THE LEGAL PRECONDITIONS

01:29:50.819 --> 01:29:53.788 region:rollup2
WHEN THE CVR I CURRENTLY ONLY

REQUIRES TO.

01:29:53.788 --> 01:29:57.559 region:rollup2
THIS CHANGES A CORE PRINCIPLE OF

01:29:56.224 --> 01:29:58.860 region:rollup2
THE CVR A WHICH WAS TO ALLOW THE

01:29:57.559 --> 01:30:00.595 region:rollup2
QUESTION OF WHETHER AT LARGE

01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:01.963 region:rollup2
ELECTIONS ABRIDGED OR DILUTED

01:30:00.595 --> 01:30:03.231 region:rollup2
THE RIGHTS OF VOTERS. FROM THE

01:30:01.963 --> 01:30:05.567 region:rollup2
QUESTION OF WHETHER THEY WERE

01:30:03.231 --> 01:30:07.102 region:rollup2
GEOGRAPHICALLY CONCENTRATED.

01:30:05.567 --> 01:30:08.837 region:rollup2
IT ALSO CONTAINS A PROBLEMATIC

01:30:07.102 --> 01:30:11.006 region:rollup2
SHIFT IN THE REMEDIES UNDER THE

01:30:08.837 --> 01:30:13.208 region:rollup2
SEA VERY NOW ONLY THE COURT CAN

01:30:11.006 --> 01:30:15.977 region:rollup2
IMPOSE REMEDIES THIS ALLOWS THE

01:30:13.208 --> 01:30:17.379 region:rollup2
VIOLIN TEEN VIOLATED ENTITY. TO

01:30:15.977 --> 01:30:19.047 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT ITS OWN REMEDIES AND

01:30:17.379 --> 01:30:20.582 region:rollup2
THE BILL IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THE

01:30:19.047 --> 01:30:21.750 region:rollup2
VIOLIN AND TO DATE COULD DO SO

01:30:20.582 --> 01:30:23.485 region:rollup2
OVER THE OBJECTIONS OF

01:30:21.750 --> 01:30:25.453 region:rollup2
PLAINTIFFS THAT PREVAILED OR THE

01:30:23.485 --> 01:30:26.821 region:rollup2
COURT. MAY ALSO THINK THAT THE

01:30:25.453 --> 01:30:29.724 region:rollup2
SHIFT IN THE ATTORNEY'S FEES

01:30:26.821 --> 01:30:30.625 region:rollup2
COULD CHILL PLAINTIFFS ABILITY

01:30:29.724 --> 01:30:32.227 region:rollup2
TO BRING THESE CASES ON THAT

01:30:30.625 --> 01:30:34.062 region:rollup2
RECEIVE ER. AND FORCE THEM TO

01:30:32.227 --> 01:30:35.931 region:rollup2
MOVE TO HAVING TO BRING CLAIMS

01:30:34.062 --> 01:30:37.999 region:rollup2
UNDER THE MORE CUMBERSOME AND

01:30:35.931 --> 01:30:39.134 region:rollup2
BURDENSOME AND COSTLY FEDERAL

01:30:37.999 --> 01:30:41.569 region:rollup2
VOTING RIGHTS ACT.

01:30:39.134 --> 01:30:43.271 region:rollup2
AND THIS BILL IS COUNTER TO THE

01:30:41.569 --> 01:30:44.306 region:rollup2
BIPARTISAN LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS

01:30:43.271 --> 01:30:46.541 region:rollup2

01:30:46.541 --> 01:30:49.077 region:rollup2
WHAT JURISDICTIONS CAN MOVED OUT

IT IS ACTUALLY QUITE SMALL.

01:35:48.643 --> 01:35:51.679 region:rollup2
ABOUT SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE SO IF

01:35:50.044 --> 01:35:53.047 region:rollup2
YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT A CITY

IF YOU HAVE A FOUR THOUSAND OF

THEY RECENTLY GOT A LETTER.

01:36:09.597 --> 01:36:13.067 region:rollup2
FROM A PREDATORY LAW FIRM AND

01:36:11.666 --> 01:36:13.735 region:rollup2
ARE RATHER THAN BECAUSE THEY

01:36:13.067 --> 01:36:15.103 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THE FINANCIAL

01:36:13.735 --> 01:36:15.670 region:rollup2
RESOURCES TO FIGHT IT AND

01:36:15.103 --> 01:36:16.371 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T LOOKED AT PRESIDENT

CONCLUDED THAT NO CITY THEIR

01:36:18.740 --> 01:36:23.411 region:rollup2
SIZE COULD WIN. A CHALLENGE.

01:36:21.643 --> 01:36:24.912 region:rollup2
UNDER THE CVR A.

01:36:23.411 --> 01:36:26.481 region:rollup2
AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT

A PROTECTED CLASSES RIGHTS WERE

01:36:26.481 --> 01:36:28.983 region:rollup2
BEING VIOLATED AND YOU KNOW

01:36:27.749 --> 01:36:30.718 region:rollup2
HAVING LIVED IN THAT CITY I I'D

01:36:28.983 --> 01:36:32.453 region:rollup2
SHARE THEIR OPINION THAT.

01:36:30.718 --> 01:36:34.722 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO VIOLATION OF A

01:36:32.453 --> 01:36:35.923 region:rollup2
PROTECTED. CLASS BUT.

01:36:34.722 --> 01:36:36.891 region:rollup2
BUT THEY THEY CONCLUDED THEY

01:36:35.923 --> 01:36:37.692 region:rollup2
COULDN'T FIGHT IT IT NEVER

01:36:36.891 --> 01:36:39.260 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL RESOURCES DO SO

01:36:37.692 --> 01:36:42.530 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GOING TO DISTRICT

01:36:39.260 --> 01:36:43.431 region:rollup2
pTHAT SO FIFTEEN OTHER PEOPLE

01:36:42.530 --> 01:36:44.499 region:rollup2
VOTE NOW THEY HAVE FIVE

01:36:43.431 --> 01:36:45.633 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS SO THREE HUNDRED

01:36:44.499 --> 01:36:47.201 region:rollup2
PEOPLE.

01:36:45.633 --> 01:36:48.302 region:rollup2
ARE VOTING IN EACH DISTRICT AND

01:36:47.201 --> 01:36:49.671 region:rollup2
IT REQUIRES FIFTY PERCENT TO GET

01:36:48.302 --> 01:36:50.204 region:rollup2
ELECTED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY

01:36:49.671 --> 01:36:51.339 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE ELECTING A CITY

01:36:50.204 --> 01:36:53.341 region:rollup2
COUNCILMAN.

01:36:51.339 --> 01:36:55.109 region:rollup2
THAT IS RIDICULOUS.

01:36:53.341 --> 01:36:56.377 region:rollup2
OUR IT LEADS TO A COUPLE OF

01:36:55.109 --> 01:36:57.178 region:rollup2
UNIQUE PROBLEMS FIRST OF ALL

01:36:56.377 --> 01:36:59.047 region:rollup2
EVERYONE IN THE CITY NOW FEELS

01:36:57.178 --> 01:37:01.382 region:rollup2
DISENFRANCHISED BECAUSE WHEREAS

01:36:59.047 --> 01:37:02.917 region:rollup2
BEFORE THEY HAD A SAY. IN THE

01:37:01.382 --> 01:37:04.118 region:rollup2
COMPOSITION OF THE ENTIRE

01:37:02.917 --> 01:37:05.153 region:rollup2
COUNCIL NOW THEY ONLY HAVE A SAY

01:37:04.118 --> 01:37:06.821 region:rollup2
IN THE COMPOSITION OF ONE.

01:37:05.153 --> 01:37:08.323 region:rollup2
COUNCIL SEAT

01:37:06.821 --> 01:37:09.957 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S ONE PROBLEM FOR LARGER

01:37:08.323 --> 01:37:11.559 region:rollup2
PROBLEM IS THAT WE HAVE PROBLEMS

01:37:09.957 --> 01:37:12.927 region:rollup2
EVEN FINING PEOPLE. OF THOSE

01:37:11.559 --> 01:37:14.395 region:rollup2
HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE WHO WHO

01:37:12.927 --> 01:37:15.329 region:rollup2
WANT TO SERVE ON CITY COUNCIL

01:37:14.395 --> 01:37:17.198 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT'S A VERY SMALL

01:37:15.329 --> 01:37:18.833 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE ARE WILLING

01:37:17.198 --> 01:37:20.168 region:rollup2
TO PUT THEMSELVES OUT THERE AND.

01:37:18.833 --> 01:37:21.903 region:rollup2
SERVE IN PUBLIC OFFICE AND SO.

01:37:20.168 --> 01:37:23.338 region:rollup2
WE'RE GETTING TO THE POINT

01:37:21.903 --> 01:37:24.706 region:rollup2
WHERE WE HAVE TO TALK PEOPLE

01:37:23.338 --> 01:37:25.840 region:rollup2
INTO RUNNING.

01:37:24.706 --> 01:37:27.408 region:rollup2
I WHICH IS COMPLETELY COUNTER TO

01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:28.209 region:rollup2
A FREE DEMOCRACY AND WE SHOULD

01:37:27.408 --> 01:37:29.644 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN

01:37:28.209 --> 01:37:30.611 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE PEOPLE INSTEAD OF

01:37:29.644 --> 01:37:32.547 region:rollup2
HAVING. A.

01:37:30.611 --> 01:37:33.815 region:rollup2
A OF ELECTION BY ACCLAMATION

01:37:32.547 --> 01:37:34.816 region:rollup2
WHERE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE

01:37:33.815 --> 01:37:36.551 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE'S ONE NAME ON THE

01:37:34.816 --> 01:37:38.352 region:rollup2
BALLOT. SO THEY'VE JUST A LOT OF

01:37:36.551 --> 01:37:40.088 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PROBLEMS THAT ARE ARE

01:37:38.352 --> 01:37:41.556 region:rollup2
BEING CAUSED BY THIS AND IT'S

01:37:40.088 --> 01:37:43.024 region:rollup2
NOT JUST IN THE CITY I LIVE IN

01:37:41.556 --> 01:37:44.359 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S ACROSS CALIFORNIA THAT

01:37:43.024 --> 01:37:45.727 region:rollup2
THIS PROBLEM IS OCCURRING AND.

01:37:44.359 --> 01:37:46.994 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK THAT WE IN THE

01:37:45.727 --> 01:37:48.663 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE BEAR RESPONSIBILITY

01:37:46.994 --> 01:37:49.664 region:rollup2
FOR THIS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT A

01:37:48.663 --> 01:37:51.299 region:rollup2
PROBLEM EXISTS.

01:37:49.664 --> 01:37:52.266 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S IS NOT TAKE AWAY FROM

01:37:51.299 --> 01:37:54.102 region:rollup2
THE GOOD WORK THE TO SEE OVER

01:37:52.266 --> 01:37:54.936 region:rollup2
THE ARE A DOES IT'S NOT TO SAY

01:37:54.102 --> 01:37:57.038 region:rollup2
THAT ALL CITIES ARE LIKE.

01:37:54.936 --> 01:37:58.840 region:rollup2
MY CITY.

01:37:57.038 --> 01:38:00.007 region:rollup2
WHERE H. SWITCH TO BUY DISTRICT

01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:01.642 region:rollup2
ELECTIONS WOULDN'T BENEFIT A

01:38:00.007 --> 01:38:03.111 region:rollup2
PROTECTED CLASS BUT NOT ALL

01:38:01.642 --> 01:38:05.079 region:rollup2
CITIES ARE LIKE THAT AND I THINK

01:38:03.111 --> 01:38:06.814 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S A REASONABLE THING? TO

01:38:05.079 --> 01:38:07.949 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO TO HAVE TO REQUIRE A

01:38:06.814 --> 01:38:09.417 region:rollup2
PLAINTIFF WHO BRINGS A CHALLENGE

01:38:07.949 --> 01:38:10.985 region:rollup2
UNDER THE CITY ARE A TO PROVE

01:38:09.417 --> 01:38:12.019 region:rollup2
THAT A SWITCH TO BUY DISTRICT

01:38:10.985 --> 01:38:13.321 region:rollup2
ELECTIONS WOULD ACTUALLY BE

01:38:12.019 --> 01:38:14.322 region:rollup2
BETTER FOR THE PEOPLE WE'RE

01:38:13.321 --> 01:38:16.391 region:rollup2
TRYING TO PROTECT I DON'T THINK

01:38:14.322 --> 01:38:18.493 region:rollup2
THAT'S UNREASONABLE AT ALL. SO I

01:38:16.391 --> 01:38:19.861 region:rollup2
I'D LIKE TO ENCOURAGE.

01:38:18.493 --> 01:38:20.928 region:rollup2
I THIS THIS BODY THE LEGISLATURE

01:38:19.861 --> 01:38:22.463 region:rollup2
IN THIS COMMITTEE TO CONTINUE TO

01:38:20.928 --> 01:38:24.699 region:rollup2
WORK ON THIS ISSUE BECAUSE WE

01:38:22.463 --> 01:38:25.233 region:rollup2
ARE DOING A DISSERVICE TO

01:38:24.699 --> 01:38:26.367 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTS INTO CITIES

01:38:25.233 --> 01:38:31.372 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA BY FAILING

01:38:26.367 --> 01:38:33.207 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE.

01:38:31.372 --> 01:38:34.642 region:rollup2
YOU'RE MUCH VICE ARBOR AND THEN.

TALKING ABOUT A SMALLER

01:38:40.882 --> 01:38:44.652 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE PUT OVER

01:38:42.650 --> 01:38:45.987 region:rollup2
THE BARREL BY THIS PROCESS.

01:38:44.652 --> 01:38:47.422 region:rollup2
I IT SEEMS CLEAR TO ME AFTER

01:38:45.987 --> 01:38:48.389 region:rollup2
HEARING THE COMMENTS THAT UP

01:38:47.422 --> 01:38:50.525 region:rollup2
PART OF THE.

01:38:48.389 --> 01:38:52.960 region:rollup2
THE OPPOSITION'S MOTIVE IS TO

BE ABLE TO KEEP THE PIPELINES OF

OUT WHICH FEEL THE OBLIGATION TO

01:39:11.946 --> 01:39:14.749 region:rollup2
PAY OUT BECAUSE IT'S SO RISKY

01:39:13.848 --> 01:39:16.150 region:rollup2
FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY GO IN THE

01:39:14.749 --> 01:39:19.020 region:rollup2
OTHER DIRECTION.

IN DIVIDING OUR CITIES ARE I

01:39:24.659 --> 01:39:27.862 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THIS BILL PROVIDES AN

01:39:26.394 --> 01:39:29.230 region:rollup2
OUTSTANDING REMEDY FOR THIS

01:39:27.862 --> 01:39:31.032 region:rollup2
SITUATION AND I THINK THAT.

01:39:29.230 --> 01:39:33.501 region:rollup2
WHAT THIS IS DEVOLVED INTO IS

01:39:31.032 --> 01:39:36.471 region:rollup2

01:40:21.482 --> 01:40:24.952 region:rollup2
IT AND I THINK THE BIGGEST CASE

01:40:23.251 --> 01:40:26.420 region:rollup2
A AND AND AND AND THE STRONGEST

01:40:24.952 --> 01:40:27.021 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE THAT I HAVE IS MY CITY

01:40:26.420 --> 01:40:29.357 region:rollup2
THE CITY THAT I LIVE IN IS THE

01:40:27.021 --> 01:40:30.758 region:rollup2
CITY OF WHITTIER. WHICH WE OFTEN

01:40:29.357 --> 01:40:31.692 region:rollup2
REFERRED TO AS A CITY WITH.

01:40:30.758 --> 01:40:33.561 region:rollup2
THE TWO CITIES WITHIN ONE AYE

01:40:31.692 --> 01:40:34.295 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT.

01:40:33.561 --> 01:40:36.197 region:rollup2
ARE.

01:40:34.295 --> 01:40:38.933 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCES VERY BIG

01:40:36.197 --> 01:40:41.669 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ARE AT THIS

01:40:38.933 --> 01:40:42.537 region:rollup2
CITY OUT ONE SIDE VERSUS THE

01:40:41.669 --> 01:40:43.337 region:rollup2
OTHER YOU HAVE ONE SIDE IS

01:40:42.537 --> 01:40:44.305 region:rollup2
REALLY NICE REALLY IF ONE WERE

01:40:43.337 --> 01:40:46.207 region:rollup2
ON THE HILLS. WELL LOT OF

01:40:44.305 --> 01:40:47.708 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS ARE MADE A LOT OF.

01:40:46.207 --> 01:40:50.378 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THE CITY.

01:40:47.708 --> 01:40:51.846 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN TAKING CARE OF WHERE

01:40:50.378 --> 01:40:54.015 region:rollup2
ON THE SIDE CITY WHERE I LIVE

01:40:51.846 --> 01:40:55.583 region:rollup2
ARE IT'S BEEN A VERY MUCH

01:40:54.015 --> 01:40:57.385 region:rollup2
IGNORED AND THERE'S A LACK OF

01:40:55.583 --> 01:40:58.386 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AND LACK OF. OUR

01:40:57.385 --> 01:41:01.455 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT ON THAT SIDE OF

01:40:58.386 --> 01:41:03.224 region:rollup2
WHITTIER AND AND I THINK.

01:41:01.455 --> 01:41:05.593 region:rollup2
A THE ISSUE IS IS THAT.

01:41:03.224 --> 01:41:07.228 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE.

01:41:05.593 --> 01:41:08.663 region:rollup2
COUNCIL MEMBERS OF THE TIME WERE

01:41:07.228 --> 01:41:11.198 region:rollup2
LIVING OBVIOUSLY IN THE VERY

01:41:08.663 --> 01:41:11.866 region:rollup2
NICE PART.

01:41:11.198 --> 01:41:13.534 region:rollup2
OF WHAT YOU'RE NOT LIVING ON THE

01:41:11.866 --> 01:41:15.002 region:rollup2
PART. WHERE I LIVE?

01:41:13.534 --> 01:41:16.771 region:rollup2
I AND AND SO WOULD HERE THE CITY

01:41:15.002 --> 01:41:17.405 region:rollup2
OF WHAT YOU'RE VOLUNTARILY WENT

01:41:16.771 --> 01:41:19.140 region:rollup2
TO DISTRICT ELECTIONS WITH AN AT

01:41:17.405 --> 01:41:22.376 region:rollup2
LARGE MAYOR.

01:41:19.140 --> 01:41:24.312 region:rollup2
AND AND NOW THERE ARE.

01:41:22.376 --> 01:41:26.814 region:rollup2
THREE LATINOS

01:41:24.312 --> 01:41:28.149 region:rollup2
THAT OUR ON THE CITY COUNCIL THE

01:41:26.814 --> 01:41:29.850 region:rollup2
DISTRICT IN WHICH I LIVE NOW

01:41:28.149 --> 01:41:31.152 region:rollup2
THERE IS A LOT INVESTMENT

01:41:29.850 --> 01:41:32.453 region:rollup2
THEY'RE MAKING INFRASTRUCTURE

01:41:31.152 --> 01:41:33.821 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS IN IMPROVEMENTS ARE

01:41:32.453 --> 01:41:36.057 region:rollup2
DOING HOUSING PROJECT. ARE

01:41:33.821 --> 01:41:38.726 region:rollup2
WITHIN THAT SIDE IN THAT PART.

01:41:36.057 --> 01:41:39.427 region:rollup2
OF OF MY TOWN A OUT OF MY SIGHT

01:41:38.726 --> 01:41:41.062 region:rollup2
OF WHITTIER.

01:41:39.427 --> 01:41:42.964 region:rollup2
AND AND JUST IN TERMS OF

01:41:41.062 --> 01:41:43.264 region:rollup2
TURNOUT BECAUSE WE LOOK WE

01:41:42.964 --> 01:41:45.633 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT.

01:41:43.264 --> 01:41:47.268 region:rollup2
.

01:41:45.633 --> 01:41:48.569 region:rollup2
I THINK LOCAL ELECTION JUST IN

01:41:47.268 --> 01:41:49.537 region:rollup2
GENERAL THERE'S ALWAYS VERY LOW

01:41:48.569 --> 01:41:51.238 region:rollup2
TURNOUT ESPECIALLY IN THE CITY

01:41:49.537 --> 01:41:52.673 region:rollup2
OF WATER BECAUSE IT'S AN OFF.

01:41:51.238 --> 01:41:53.774 region:rollup2
CYCLE ELECTION IT'S AN APRIL

01:41:52.673 --> 01:41:55.276 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT A JUNE OR NOVEMBER AND

01:41:53.774 --> 01:41:56.277 region:rollup2
SO THE TURNOUT IS USUALLY VERY

01:41:55.276 --> 01:41:57.345 region:rollup2
LEVEL WE BROKEN UP BY THE

01:41:56.277 --> 01:41:58.746 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS WHAT THEY AT FIGURE

01:41:57.345 --> 01:42:00.548 region:rollup2
OUT THE DISTRICTS. AND THE TURN

01:41:58.746 --> 01:42:02.316 region:rollup2
ON THE DISTRICT WHERE I LIVE HAD

01:42:00.548 --> 01:42:05.353 region:rollup2
MORE THAN DOUBLED.

01:42:02.316 --> 01:42:07.254 region:rollup2
WITH WITH THE.

01:42:05.353 --> 01:42:09.023 region:rollup2
WITH THAT ONE WE WANTED DISTRICT

01:42:07.254 --> 01:42:10.825 region:rollup2
ELECTIONS AND ELECTED AN

01:42:09.023 --> 01:42:12.627 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL WHO'S NOT ONLY LGBT

01:42:12.627 --> 01:42:15.029 region:rollup2

INVESTMENTS HOUSING PROJECTS.

01:42:19.166 --> 01:42:21.636 region:rollup2
AYE AND SO IT REALLY HAS IS DONE

01:42:21.235 --> 01:42:22.670 region:rollup2
A LOT TO HELP OUT.

01:42:21.636 --> 01:42:24.338 region:rollup2
.

01:42:22.670 --> 01:42:25.673 region:rollup2

I LIVE IN MY DISTRICT AND SO

01:42:25.673 --> 01:42:28.409 region:rollup2
I'VE SEEN THE IMPACT I THINK

01:42:27.174 --> 01:42:29.377 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF VALUE IN THE

01:42:28.409 --> 01:42:30.845 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA VOTING RIGHTS ACT.

01:42:39.887 --> 01:42:43.858 region:rollup2
TO MIKE.

I AM A COMMENTS THAT ARE GONNA

01:42:55.102 --> 01:42:58.439 region:rollup2
LET. ASK YOU TO CLOSE THE AS

01:42:56.804 --> 01:43:00.074 region:rollup2
OPPOSED ALLEN ONLY DO IT.

01:42:58.439 --> 01:43:01.342 region:rollup2
BUT THE CALIFORNIA VOTING

01:43:00.074 --> 01:43:03.110 region:rollup2
RIGHTS ACT THAT HAS HAD A

01:43:01.342 --> 01:43:04.045 region:rollup2
TRANSFORMATIVE EFFECT ON THE WAY

01:43:03.110 --> 01:43:05.446 region:rollup2
THE LOCAL OFFICIALS ARE ELECTING

01:43:04.045 --> 01:43:07.248 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND WHILE I AYE

01:43:05.446 --> 01:43:08.482 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT KNOW. THAT THE AUTHOR

01:43:07.248 --> 01:43:09.750 region:rollup2
IS TRYING TO BE RESPONSIVE TO

01:43:08.482 --> 01:43:10.718 region:rollup2
CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED BY

01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:12.820 region:rollup2
CITY IN HIS DISTRICT.

01:43:10.718 --> 01:43:14.422 region:rollup2
I DO FEAR THAT THIS BILL WOULD

01:43:12.820 --> 01:43:15.990 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKEN THE TOOLS

01:43:14.422 --> 01:43:17.158 region:rollup2
THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO CHALLENGE

01:43:15.990 --> 01:43:18.626 region:rollup2
AT LARGE ELECTION.

01:43:17.158 --> 01:43:20.261 region:rollup2
THAT UNDERMINE VOTING RIGHTS.

01:43:18.626 --> 01:43:21.429 region:rollup2
BUT WHILE AT THE SAME TIME I'D

01:43:20.261 --> 01:43:22.563 region:rollup2
I'D.

DON'T THINK THIS BILL IS IS

01:43:22.563 --> 01:43:25.399 region:rollup2
PERFECT I ALSO DON'T THINK THE

01:43:24.765 --> 01:43:26.500 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA VOTING RIGHTS ACT IS

01:43:25.399 --> 01:43:28.202 region:rollup2
PERFECT

01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:29.136 region:rollup2
A AND I DO THINK THAT THE

01:43:28.202 --> 01:43:31.205 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA VOTING RIGHTS ACT IS

01:43:29.136 --> 01:43:32.139 region:rollup2

01:43:39.713 --> 01:43:42.116 region:rollup2
RIGHT SOLUTION?

FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES NOW I

01:43:42.116 --> 01:43:46.353 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK IT'S HELPFUL OR

01:43:43.818 --> 01:43:47.154 region:rollup2

01:43:46.353 --> 01:43:47.855 region:rollup2

02:00:10.003 --> 02:00:12.706 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME PROBLEMS THAT

02:00:11.137 --> 02:00:15.008 region:rollup2
WOULD ARISE IF THIS BILL DID NOT

ENVISIONED A ONE WE WOULD NOT BE

02:00:23.183 --> 02:00:26.920 region:rollup2
ABLE TO ADJUST THE RACE AND

02:00:24.451 --> 02:00:28.254 region:rollup2
ETHNICITY DATA WITHOUT CD SEE

02:00:26.920 --> 02:00:30.623 region:rollup2
ARE GIVING IT TO US CLEARLY.

02:00:28.254 --> 02:00:31.991 region:rollup2
AND ARE ALSO THE DATA STATE THE

02:00:30.623 --> 02:00:33.693 region:rollup2
DATA SAID RECEIVED FROM CDC ARE

02:00:31.991 --> 02:00:34.994 region:rollup2
MAY NOT BE FROM THE SAME DATE AS

POPULATION THIS WOULD CREATE

02:00:37.764 --> 02:00:41.000 region:rollup2
DATA PROBLEMS.

02:00:39.499 --> 02:00:42.936 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY THE STREAMLINED AT

DATA TRANSFER WILL GIVE US SOME

02:00:42.936 --> 02:00:45.872 region:rollup2
CERTAINTY FOUR WHEN THE DATA

02:00:44.003 --> 02:00:48.007 region:rollup2
WILL ARRIVE SO THAT WE CAN

02:00:45.872 --> 02:00:49.309 region:rollup2
PREPARE FOR IT. SO TO SUMMARIZE

02:00:48.007 --> 02:00:50.877 region:rollup2
THIS IS REALLY A BILL ABOUT

02:00:49.309 --> 02:00:53.113 region:rollup2

USING PUBLIC RESOURCES

02:01:31.084 --> 02:01:34.754 region:rollup2
IT WOULD ALSO APPLY TO PRISONERS

IT ACRID COUNT.

02:02:07.253 --> 02:02:10.490 region:rollup2

A FEW PEOPLE ON DEATH ROW BUT

02:02:10.490 --> 02:02:13.860 region:rollup2

THAT IS WHY THIS WOULD ACTUALLY

02:19:30.429 --> 02:19:34.666 region:rollup2

ANALYSIS DONE.

02:19:35.033 --> 02:19:38.503 region:rollup2
IT WOULD CAUSE NOBODY TO BE

02:21:46.998 --> 02:21:51.937 region:rollup2
TWO CANDIDATE ACTS ABOUT MEASURE

02:21:48.100 --> 02:21:53.772 region:rollup2

I'VE MUCH TRUER TO SAY. THESE

02:21:53.772 --> 02:21:56.375 region:rollup2
BOOKS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE

02:21:54.940 --> 02:21:58.944 region:rollup2
PURPOSE OF PROTECTING THE

BE YOUR MARK PERHAPS IN A WAY

02:22:11.890 --> 02:22:14.826 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S FORCE ASSOCIATION THAT

IT I GUESS SCHEME THAT VAN

02:22:21.900 --> 02:22:24.703 region:rollup2
WOULD BE.

02:22:22.834 --> 02:22:26.171 region:rollup2
SO IT WOULD COST SO MUCH TO THE

02:22:24.703 --> 02:22:27.806 region:rollup2
SPONSORING ORGANIZATION THAT

02:22:26.171 --> 02:22:29.674 region:rollup2

POLITICAL DISCOURSE SO THAT IS

02:22:40.886 --> 02:22:43.655 region:rollup2

FACT THE EXACT OPPOSITE IS TRUE.

02:25:07.599 --> 02:25:11.336 region:rollup2
THAT PROVISION ACTUALLY

02:25:08.967 --> 02:25:12.470 region:rollup2
PREVENTS A LOOPHOLE WHICH WOULD

02:25:11.336 --> 02:25:13.305 region:rollup2
STOP.

02:25:12.470 --> 02:25:14.639 region:rollup2

02:28:27.398 --> 02:28:30.635 region:rollup2
THAT LAWMAKERS SHOULD REASSESS

02:28:28.967 --> 02:28:31.903 region:rollup2

02:28:43.615 --> 02:28:46.985 region:rollup2
THIS ADDED ACCOUNTABILITY WOULD

02:28:45.150 --> 02:28:48.653 region:rollup2

NUMBER OF BALLOTS HERE. THERE IS

02:30:42.834 --> 02:30:46.704 region:rollup2

THEIR BALLOT TO SOMEONE TO TURN

02:31:03.154 --> 02:31:07.258 region:rollup2
IN FOR THEM. BUT ALSO I THINK TO

02:31:04.956 --> 02:31:08.726 region:rollup2
COUNTY REGISTRARS TO BE ABLE TO

MALFEASANCE IF IT HAPPENS

IT REQUIRES.

02:34:12.310 --> 02:34:15.480 region:rollup2
