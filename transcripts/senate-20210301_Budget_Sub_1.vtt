NOR IS IT REQUIRED THE

C. C. G. I.'S VARIOUS FEATURES

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.608
ARE ACTUALLY USED BY STUDENTS

IN SCHOOLS WHICH FEATURES

PARTICULAR THEY FIND MOST

00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:49.415
VALUABLE. IF CERTAIN FEATURES

ARE NOT WIDELY USED WHY NOT

00:15:51.984 --> 00:15:53.752
GOOD MODIFICATIONS BEING MADE

00:15:53.819 --> 00:15:55.187
TO C. C. GI IN THAT CASE SO

00:15:55.254 --> 00:15:56.689
THAT FEATURES A MORE USEFUL FOR

00:15:56.755 --> 00:15:59.158

STUDENT OUTCOMES FOR EXAMPLE

00:16:05.564 --> 00:16:07.032
OUR STUDENTS WHO UC C. GI

BETTER INFORMED ABOUT COLLEGE

00:16:08.901 --> 00:16:10.569
ELIGIBILITY IN CAREER OPTIONS.

00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:12.037
AND THEIR PEERS WHO DON'T USE

00:16:12.104 --> 00:16:14.306
C. C. GI SO WE THINK THE

00:16:14.373 --> 00:16:15.140
LEGISLATURE SHOULD HAVE THIS

00:16:15.207 --> 00:16:17.309
INFORMATION. BEFORE EMBARKING

00:16:17.376 --> 00:16:19.945
ON A MAJOR AND COSTLY EXPANSION

00:16:20.012 --> 00:16:22.247
C. C. GI. INSTEAD OF PROVIDING

00:16:22.314 --> 00:16:24.817

IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO IS

00:16:26.618 --> 00:16:28.454
PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR WE

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:29.855
JUST RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE

LEGISLATURE'S NEXT STEPS. WE

00:16:37.596 --> 00:16:38.997
WOULD NOTE THAT C. C. GI IS A

00:16:39.064 --> 00:16:41.166
DISCRETE PROJECT SO TAKING TIME

00:16:41.233 --> 00:16:42.468
FOR AN EVALUATION WOULD NOT

00:16:42.534 --> 00:16:44.603
AFFECT THE OVERALL TIMELINE FOR

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:47.506
THE LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM

00:16:47.573 --> 00:16:48.607
PROJECT. NOW TO MOVE UP TO

00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:50.209
GOVERNANCE UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S

00:16:50.275 --> 00:16:51.744
PROPOSAL TWO THIRDS OF THE

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:52.978
GOVERNING BOARD WOULD BE MADE

00:16:53.045 --> 00:16:55.614

WOULD BE MADE BY A TWO THIRDS

00:17:00.619 --> 00:17:02.788
VOTE. WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:17:02.855 --> 00:17:03.722
TO HAVE MORE PUBLIC

00:17:03.789 --> 00:17:05.324
REPRESENTATION ON THE GOVERNING

00:17:05.391 --> 00:17:06.759
BOARD AS A WAY TO MITIGATE THE

00:17:06.825 --> 00:17:08.427
POSSIBILITY OF DATA PROVIDERS

00:17:08.494 --> 00:17:10.396
CONTROLLING THE DATA AND USING

00:17:10.462 --> 00:17:12.364
IT PRIMARILY FOR SEGMENT

00:17:12.431 --> 00:17:14.466
SPECIFIC INTERESTS. THIS IS

00:17:14.533 --> 00:17:16.301
PARTICULARLY TRUE GIVEN THAT

00:17:16.368 --> 00:17:17.669
UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

00:17:17.736 --> 00:17:18.971
THE GOVERNING BOARD WOULD BE

00:17:19.037 --> 00:17:20.205
CHARGED WITH DEVELOPING THE

00:17:20.272 --> 00:17:23.008
DATA REQUEST PROCESS USED BY

00:17:23.075 --> 00:17:23.876
EDUCATION RESEARCHERS AND

00:17:23.942 --> 00:17:26.378
OTHERS. HISTORICALLY SOME

00:17:26.445 --> 00:17:27.513
SEGMENTS HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT TO

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:29.815
APPROVE A REQUEST. ENSURE THAT

00:17:29.882 --> 00:17:32.584
DATA. WE ALSO THINK THE

00:17:32.651 --> 00:17:33.919
LEGISLATURE SHOULD HAVE MORE OF

00:17:33.986 --> 00:17:35.788
A ROLE IN SELECTING MEMBERS OF

00:17:35.854 --> 00:17:37.523
THE GOVERNING BOARD UNDER THE

00:17:37.589 --> 00:17:38.957
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THE

00:17:39.024 --> 00:17:41.593
GOVERNOR WOULD. GET TO SELECT

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:46.532
WELL SENATE AND ASSEMBLY

00:17:46.598 --> 00:17:48.500
COMBINED WOULD GET TO SELECT

00:17:48.567 --> 00:17:50.936
JUST TO PUBLIC MEMBERS SO WE

00:17:51.003 --> 00:17:52.004
RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:53.639
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF NON DATA

00:17:53.705 --> 00:17:54.807
PROVIDERS ON THE GOVERNING

00:17:54.873 --> 00:17:56.074
BOARD SO THEY ARE AT LEAST

00:17:56.141 --> 00:17:57.943
EQUAL TO IF NOT GREATER THAN.

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:02.014
THE NUMBER OF SEATS HELD BY THE-DATA PROVIDERS. WE FURTHER

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.916
RECOMMEND SPECIFYING. BROUGH

00:18:03.982 --> 00:18:05.551
TRAILER LANGUAGE OTHER STATUTES

00:18:05.617 --> 00:18:07.219

IN OPERATING THE DATA SYSTEM WE

00:18:20.899 --> 00:18:22.167
DON'T BELIEVE IT'S UNREASONABLE

00:18:22.234 --> 00:18:23.836
FOR A NEW OFFICE WITHIN THE

00:18:23.902 --> 00:18:25.704

00:18:38.817 --> 00:18:40.385
IT IS WORKING TO IMPROVE HOW

00:18:40.452 --> 00:18:42.754
THE STATE COLLECTS MANAGES AND

00:18:42.821 --> 00:18:44.590
USES DATA THROUGH ITS STATEWIDE

TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR GOV

00:25:23.121 --> 00:25:25.490
ONES WHERE. HE RECOMMENDED THAT

YOU WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE

00:25:27.559 --> 00:25:29.261
TO ADDRESS THEM HARBORONE LAST

00:25:29.327 --> 00:25:31.997
RELATED QUESTION. ARE ASKING

00:25:32.063 --> 00:25:33.465
HOW THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET

00:25:33.531 --> 00:25:35.333
REQUEST IT'S UNDER REVIEW BY

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.235
THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET

00:25:37.302 --> 00:25:42.207
COMMITTEE. INTEGRATES WITH OF.

00:25:42.274 --> 00:25:45.744
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL.

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:48.446
THAT'S THE FINANCE. DURING

00:25:48.513 --> 00:25:51.149
THEIR TWO CORE COMPONENTS- ONE.

00:25:51.216 --> 00:25:53.218
IS A PROOF OF CONCEPT A

00:25:53.285 --> 00:25:56.187
COMPONENT. WHERE BY WORKING

00:25:56.254 --> 00:25:58.523
WITH ATTEMPTING. LOOK AT SOME

00:25:58.590 --> 00:25:59.824
OF THE SOFTWARE PACKAGES THAT

00:25:59.891 --> 00:26:01.359
ARE AVAILABLE TO ENSURE THE

00:26:01.426 --> 00:26:03.128
THING ON SOFTWARE PACKAGES AND

00:26:03.194 --> 00:26:04.596
A TECHNICAL INFRASTRUCTURE

00:26:04.663 --> 00:26:06.464
WOULD FACILITATE THE TRANSFER

00:26:06.531 --> 00:26:09.167
OF DATA. BETWEEN EIGHTEEN- IN

00:26:09.234 --> 00:26:11.002
MEETINGS SO THERE'S A- I THINK

00:26:11.069 --> 00:26:12.837
IT'S THREE SPECIFIC ENTITIES

00:26:12.904 --> 00:26:14.739
THAT HAVE AGREED TO PILOT

00:26:14.806 --> 00:26:15.974
CERTAIN DATA SETS THAT THEY

00:26:16.041 --> 00:26:17.609
HAVE TO SEE THAT THOSE

00:26:17.676 --> 00:26:19.444
EXCHANGES CAN OCCUR AND ARE

00:26:19.511 --> 00:26:21.446
OCCURRING AS INTENDED. TO

00:26:21.513 --> 00:26:23.548
SUPPORT THE DATA SYSTEM AND

00:26:23.615 --> 00:26:24.783
THEN THE SECOND COMPONENT

00:26:24.849 --> 00:26:26.851
PROBABLY THE LARGER COMPONENT

00:26:26.918 --> 00:26:28.720
IS THERE ARE SOME RESOURCES

00:26:28.787 --> 00:26:31.356
THAT ARE SET ASIDE FOR. FUTURE

00:26:31.423 --> 00:26:33.792
SUPPORT OF THE PROGRAM FOR ONE

00:26:33.858 --> 00:26:35.560
TIME COSTS THAT WOULD OCCUR AND

00:26:35.627 --> 00:26:39.431
ALSO TO SUPPORT SOME TECHNICAL-

00:26:39.497 --> 00:26:42.267
REVISIONS TO EXISTING SYSTEMS

00:26:42.334 --> 00:26:43.969
TO HELP FACILITATE A

00:26:44.035 --> 00:26:45.770
COMPATIBILITY WITH THE DATA

00:26:45.837 --> 00:26:48.173
EXCHANGES SO A THERE WOULD BE

00:26:48.239 --> 00:26:50.475
SOME SUPPORT FOR. THE

00:26:50.542 --> 00:26:51.576

FOR THOSE EQUITY GAPS. THE

00:33:00.078 --> 00:33:01.879
SECOND MAJOR EXPECTATION IS

MATH OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:05.335
OBVIOUSLY THE STIMULUS FUNDS

00:50:05.402 --> 00:50:07.604
DID NOT MAKE UP THE INITIAL

00:50:07.671 --> 00:50:09.373
LOSS THAT YOU SAID YOU'D HAVE

00:50:09.439 --> 00:50:11.475

ARE ALSO USING. FOR OUR CAMPUS

00:50:38.835 --> 00:50:39.970
CORE OPERATIONS WE HAVE BEEN

00:50:40.036 --> 00:50:43.073
USING A VARIETY OF. COST

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:44.708
CONTAINMENT MEASURES INCLUDING

CONTAINMENT MEASURES. BUT IN.

00:51:00.757 --> 00:51:01.825
THE STIMULUS MAKES UP. SOME

00:51:01.892 --> 00:51:03.059
SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE

00:51:03.126 --> 00:51:05.429
LOANS AND ALLOWED SET TO BE

00:51:05.495 --> 00:51:08.832
PAID BACK IS THAT CORRECT. BUT

00:51:08.899 --> 00:51:10.367
WE ARE STILL HOPING FOR FURTHER

00:51:10.434 --> 00:51:11.968
FEDERAL STIMULUS AND I MEAN THE

00:51:12.035 --> 00:51:13.603
EXISTING STIMULUS THAT YOU'RE

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:15.972
GETTING SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS TWO

00:51:16.039 --> 00:51:17.240
THIRDS OF THE REDUCTIONS YOU

00:51:17.307 --> 00:51:19.443
HAD FROM COVERED IN SOUNDS LIKE

00:51:19.509 --> 00:51:21.511
THE LOAN. WAS VERY SIMILAR TO

00:51:21.578 --> 00:51:22.746
THE AMOUNT OF REDUCTIONS YOU

00:51:22.813 --> 00:51:24.080
TAKEN FROM COVERED SO WOULDN'T

00:51:24.147 --> 00:51:26.483
A STIMULUS ALLOW YOU TO PAY

00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:29.719
BACK PART OF THE LONG. NOPE

00:51:29.786 --> 00:51:32.155
BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE. A LOT OF

00:51:32.222 --> 00:51:33.457
EXTRAORDINARY COSTS ON THE

00:51:33.523 --> 00:51:34.858
CAMPUSES SO THAT FEDERAL

00:51:34.925 --> 00:51:36.760
STIMULUS FUNDS HAVE PROVIDED US

00:51:36.827 --> 00:51:40.163
WITH ABOUT HALF. OF OUR CODE.

00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:42.232

00:51:42.299 --> 00:51:43.834
COVER DIRECT EXPENDITURES WELL

00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:48.338

THE- THE LINEAR- BALLOT SHE WAS

00:52:46.229 --> 00:52:47.964

YEAH I THINK IT'S- TIME WE WILL

00:53:08.151 --> 00:53:11.588
HAVE. CAN QUICKLY RESPOND TO A

00:53:11.655 --> 00:53:13.657
UC RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT

00:53:13.723 --> 00:53:14.958
IMPLEMENTING SOME OF OUR

00:53:15.025 --> 00:53:17.127
PROPOSED EXPECTATIONS I WOULD

00:53:17.193 --> 00:53:18.828
JUST NOTED A HIGH LEVEL THAT.

00:53:18.895 --> 00:53:20.163
WE'RE PROPOSING SOME

00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:23.400
SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES THAT ARE

00:53:23.466 --> 00:53:25.535
OVER AND ABOVE WHERE YOU SEE A

00:53:25.602 --> 00:53:29.172
EXPECTED TO BE. IN THE CONTEXT

00:53:29.239 --> 00:53:30.473
OF THE REST OF THE COUNTRY

00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:31.975
WHERE PEOPLE AND OTHER STATES

00:53:32.042 --> 00:53:33.109
ARE CUTTING HIGHER EDUCATION

00:53:33.176 --> 00:53:35.478
BUDGETS THIS IS A DRAMATIC

00:53:35.545 --> 00:53:37.747
OPPORTUNITY TO NOT JUST. NOT

00:53:37.814 --> 00:53:40.650
CUT BUT TO DO MORE THAT THAT'S

00:53:40.717 --> 00:53:42.652
ACTUALLY SOMETHING IS POSSIBLE.

00:53:42.719 --> 00:53:44.220
THE UC IS A CRITICAL

00:53:44.287 --> 00:53:45.789
INSTITUTION FOR THE STATE OF

00:53:45.855 --> 00:53:47.524
CALIFORNIA. TRAINS THE WORK

00:53:47.591 --> 00:53:49.759
FORCE DOES THE RESEARCH THAT

00:53:49.826 --> 00:53:51.695
MAKES THE ECONOMY MOVE FORWARD.

00:53:51.761 --> 00:53:53.196
AND GIVEN THAT THAT IT IS SUCH

00:53:53.263 --> 00:53:55.098
A SUCCESSFUL INSTITUTION WE DO

00:53:55.165 --> 00:53:56.066
THINK THAT THEY HAVE THE

00:53:56.132 --> 00:53:57.834
CAPACITY TO IMPLEMENT OUR

00:53:57.901 --> 00:53:59.603
PROPOSED EXPECTATIONS INCLUDING

00:53:59.669 --> 00:54:01.371
REACHING THE TEN PERCENTAGE

00:54:01.438 --> 00:54:04.507
POINTS GREATER ONLINE CAPACITY

00:54:04.574 --> 00:54:06.242
ABOUT THREE COVERED LEVELS. THE

00:54:06.309 --> 00:54:09.312
INCLUDING REACHING THE EQUITY

00:54:09.379 --> 00:54:11.948
GAPS WHICH THIS IS THE TIME TO

00:54:12.015 --> 00:54:15.051
MAKE EXTRA EQUITY A CENTRAL

00:54:15.118 --> 00:54:18.588
INSTITUTIONAL FOCUS. THE L. A.

00:54:18.655 --> 00:54:20.957
ALSO RAISED A CONCERN ABOUT. BY

00:54:21.024 --> 00:54:22.659
THE ONGOING NATURE OF OUR

00:54:22.726 --> 00:54:24.294
PROPOSED BASED AUGMENTATIONS

00:54:24.361 --> 00:54:26.396
AND WE WOULD NOTE THAT. THAT

00:54:26.463 --> 00:54:28.565
BECAUSE THE UC IS A IT'S A

00:54:28.632 --> 00:54:30.133
PRIORITY FOR THE STATE HIGHER

00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:31.434
EDUCATION IS A PRIORITY FOR THE

00:54:31.501 --> 00:54:32.902
STATE THAT'S WHERE THE

00:54:32.969 --> 00:54:33.470
ADMINISTRATION'S COMING FROM

00:54:33.536 --> 00:54:35.171
AND- BECAUSE IN THESE ONGOING

00:54:35.238 --> 00:54:39.609
RESOURCES. AT THE OTHER NOTE IS

00:54:39.676 --> 00:54:42.212
THAT YOU SEE IS NOT. ONLY MADE

00:54:42.278 --> 00:54:43.913
UP SOME OF THE COVERT EXPENSES

00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:47.317
AS NOTED BUT THE SIGNIFICANT

00:54:47.384 --> 00:54:48.518
THE BIGGEST PORTION OF THOSE

00:54:48.585 --> 00:54:50.387
CAME FROM AUXILIARIES AND FROM

00:54:50.453 --> 00:54:53.657
HOSPITAL COSTS SO DO YOU SEE

00:54:53.723 --> 00:54:55.759
BUDGET HAS A COMPLEX THERE'S

00:54:55.825 --> 00:54:56.993
COMPLEX IMPACTS ON IT FROM KOBE

00:54:57.060 --> 00:55:00.530
AND- IN OUR OUR EMPHASIS ON

00:55:00.597 --> 00:55:03.099
UNDERGRADUATE AND- GRADUATE

00:55:03.166 --> 00:55:06.436
EDUCATION AND OTHER. OTHER

00:55:06.503 --> 00:55:08.405
STATE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE

00:55:08.471 --> 00:55:09.305
OUTSIDE OF THE MORE COMPLEX

00:55:09.372 --> 00:55:11.875
BUDGET WE DO THINK THESE

00:55:11.941 --> 00:55:12.342
INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE

00:55:12.409 --> 00:55:14.577
PROPOSING. PROVIDE THEM

00:55:14.644 --> 00:55:16.646
SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES ENOUGH TO

00:55:16.713 --> 00:55:18.415
DO WHAT OUR EXPECTATIONS

00:55:18.481 --> 00:55:21.384
PROPOSED AND- TO ADDRESS THEIR

00:55:21.451 --> 00:55:23.953
OTHER COSTS SO. HOPEFULLY THAT

00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:25.922
WAS A COVERED A LOT OF THINGS

00:55:25.989 --> 00:55:28.324
IT DID AND LET ME FOLLOW UP

00:55:28.391 --> 00:55:30.593
WITH THE UNIVERSITY ON JUST. A

00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:32.729
AND THEN BACK TO FINANCE ON ONE

00:55:32.796 --> 00:55:35.231
LAST QUESTION AND I'M SURE. MY

00:55:35.298 --> 00:55:37.233
COLLEAGUES HAVE QUESTIONS A. N.

00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:39.202
FOR THE UNIVERSITY NOW THAT.

00:55:39.269 --> 00:55:42.272
ARE OF THE RESTORATION IS BACK

00:55:42.338 --> 00:55:45.608
DOES THAT IMPACT ANY POTENTIAL

00:55:45.675 --> 00:55:48.978
FALL TWENTY TWENTY TWO TUITION

00:55:49.045 --> 00:55:52.082
INCREASE. IT RESTORATION GETS

00:55:52.148 --> 00:55:54.517
US BACK TO THE TWO THOUSAND

00:55:54.584 --> 00:55:56.953
NINETEEN TWENTY- THIS SCHOOL

00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:58.521
YEAR FUNDING LEVEL. OVERSEE

00:55:58.588 --> 00:56:01.191
STILL HAS MANDATORY COST ROSE

00:56:01.257 --> 00:56:03.426
UP FOR THE CURRENT YEAR AND FOR

00:56:03.493 --> 00:56:04.961
THE BUDGET YEAR- FOR THE

00:56:05.028 --> 00:56:06.496
CURRENT YEAR COST GROWTH IS

00:56:06.563 --> 00:56:07.964
ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR

00:56:08.031 --> 00:56:09.799
MILLION AND FOR THE BUDGET YEAR

00:56:09.866 --> 00:56:11.134
IT'S HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN

00:56:11.201 --> 00:56:13.336
POINT SEVEN MILLION- THOSE

00:56:13.403 --> 00:56:15.505
COSTS NEED TO BE COVERED WE'RE

00:56:15.572 --> 00:56:17.040
HOPING THAT THE STATE WILL

00:56:17.107 --> 00:56:18.808
COVERED THE BUDGET YEAR

00:56:18.875 --> 00:56:20.477
MANDATORY COST GROWTH AND WE

00:56:20.543 --> 00:56:23.113
INTEND TO COVER. OF THE CURRENT

00:56:23.179 --> 00:56:25.615
YEAR COST GROWTH THROUGH

00:56:25.682 --> 00:56:30.487
INTERNAL CUTS. BUT IT TWENTY

00:56:30.553 --> 00:56:31.054
TWO TWENTY THREE FISCAL YEAR

00:56:31.121 --> 00:56:32.655
WILL STILL HAVE MORE POTENTIAL

00:56:32.722 --> 00:56:35.558
COST GROWTH OF MORE ENROLLMENT

00:56:35.625 --> 00:56:39.195
AS THOUGH WE ARE AT THIS POINT

00:56:39.262 --> 00:56:40.697
NOT WANTING TO COMMIT THE

00:56:40.764 --> 00:56:42.065
REGION'S TO ANY PARTICULAR

00:56:42.132 --> 00:56:44.567
ACTION ON TUITION- YEARS FROM

00:56:44.634 --> 00:56:46.102
NOW WE THINK THAT THAT IS A

00:56:46.169 --> 00:56:47.837
CONVERSATION WE HAD WITH THE

00:56:47.904 --> 00:56:48.905
LEGISLATURE REGARDING

00:56:48.972 --> 00:56:51.574

WITH STABLE FUNDING SOURCES- IF

00:56:57.881 --> 00:56:59.249
WE- HAVE. STEADY FUNDING

00:56:59.315 --> 00:57:01.584
INCREASES OF WEEKEND THEN

SERVICES TO ALL OUR STUDENTS

00:57:05.889 --> 00:57:07.824
MAKING CERTAIN THAT THE CURRENT

00:57:09.325 --> 00:57:12.128

FINANCE ONE OF THE THINGS IT'S

00:58:24.901 --> 00:58:26.970
WITH REGARD TO POTENTIAL. ARE

WITNESSES- I JUST WANT TO

00:59:16.653 --> 00:59:18.888
FIRST- REITERATE THE IMPORTANCE

00:59:18.955 --> 00:59:20.623
IN MY VIEW OF THE DAYS FUNDING

00:59:20.690 --> 00:59:22.926
INCREASES- THIS IS AN IMPORTANT

00:59:22.992 --> 00:59:24.794
INVESTMENT AS I SUGGESTED

00:59:24.861 --> 00:59:25.728
EARLIER AND I'M VERY HAPPY TO

00:59:25.795 --> 00:59:28.631
SEE THIS- MY PERSONAL QUESTIONS

00:59:28.698 --> 00:59:30.833
ARE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- AND

00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:33.469
THE FIRST ONE JUST ECHOES- OF

00:59:33.536 --> 00:59:35.338
THE TESTIMONY FROM UC'S

00:59:35.405 --> 00:59:38.341
WITNESS. AROUND THE CONDITION

00:59:38.408 --> 00:59:40.410
REQUIRING THAT THERE BE AN

00:59:40.476 --> 00:59:42.478
INCREASE IN OF 10% AND ONLINE

00:59:42.545 --> 00:59:44.314
OFFERINGS. AS YOU MAY KNOW

00:59:44.380 --> 00:59:46.049
BEFORE JOINING THE STATE SENATE

00:59:46.115 --> 00:59:47.183
I WAS A FACULTY MEMBER AT UC

00:59:47.250 --> 00:59:49.485
IRVINE AND I MYSELF TALK ONLINE

00:59:49.552 --> 00:59:50.987
CLASSES DURING THE SPRING AND

00:59:51.054 --> 00:59:52.722
FALL SEMESTERS IN TWENTY TWENTY

00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:54.557
DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. AND I HAVE

00:59:54.624 --> 00:59:56.392
A LOT OF CONCERNS I CAN TELL

00:59:56.459 --> 00:59:57.360
YOU FROM FIRSTHAND EXPERIENCE

00:59:57.427 --> 00:59:59.862
THAT ONLINE TEACHING IS

00:59:59.929 --> 01:00:01.631
GENERALLY A POOR SUBSTITUTE FOR

01:00:01.698 --> 01:00:03.599
IN PERSON INSTRUCTION- BUT

01:00:03.666 --> 01:00:04.567
THERE'S ALSO A NUMBER OF OTHER

01:00:04.634 --> 01:00:05.835
PRINCIPLES I THINK IMPORTANT

01:00:05.902 --> 01:00:07.737
HERE FIRST- THERE'S THIS

01:00:07.804 --> 01:00:09.205
CONCEPT OF ACADEMIC FREEDOM

01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:10.907
WHICH IS A REALLY A CORE

01:00:10.974 --> 01:00:12.642
PRINCIPLE OF HIGHER EDUCATION.

01:00:12.709 --> 01:00:14.510
R. THE IDEA IS THAT PROFESSORS

01:00:14.577 --> 01:00:16.579
SHOULD BE IN THE BEST POSITION

01:00:16.646 --> 01:00:17.647
TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS

01:00:17.714 --> 01:00:19.916
REGARDING PEDAGOGY KEEPING

01:00:19.983 --> 01:00:21.784
TEACHING METHODOLOGIES AND

01:00:21.851 --> 01:00:24.153
LIKEWISE. AND I BELIEVE THAT A

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:25.822
REQUIREMENT 410% ACROSS THE

01:00:25.888 --> 01:00:27.190
BOARD INCREASE IN ONLINE

01:00:27.256 --> 01:00:28.524
LEARNING WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY

01:00:28.591 --> 01:00:30.026
INFRINGE ON THE PEDAGOGICAL

01:00:30.093 --> 01:00:34.564
AUTONOMY OF. PROFESSORS AND

01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:36.265
OTHER FACULTY. I SECOND. EVEN

01:00:36.332 --> 01:00:37.500
IF IT WAS A PRO TO. ON ACADEMIC

01:00:37.567 --> 01:00:39.969
FREEDOM. I WOULD THINK THAT

01:00:40.036 --> 01:00:41.471
THIS DECISION TO PUT MORE

01:00:41.537 --> 01:00:42.839
ONLINE EDUCATION WOULD BE MORE

01:00:42.905 --> 01:00:44.007
APPROPRIATELY MADE BY

01:00:44.073 --> 01:00:46.042
INDIVIDUAL DEPARTMENTS.

01:00:46.109 --> 01:00:48.344
POSSIBLY BY CAMPUSES. IF IT WAS

01:00:48.411 --> 01:00:49.645
SEEM NECESSARY TO HAVE SOME

01:00:49.712 --> 01:00:52.215
KIND OF STATEWIDE PUSH. OUT

01:00:52.281 --> 01:00:53.783
FROM THE REGION'S RATHER THAN

01:00:53.850 --> 01:00:56.252
FROM SACRAMENTO- PARTICULARLY

01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:58.621
GIVEN THAT AS I UNDERSTAND IT

01:00:58.688 --> 01:01:00.556
THERE IS JUST A- PLETHORA

01:01:00.623 --> 01:01:03.192
RESEARCH SUGGESTING. THAT IN

01:01:03.259 --> 01:01:04.327
PERSON INSTRUCTION IS MORE

01:01:04.394 --> 01:01:05.762
EFFECTIVE THAN ONLINE LEARNING

01:01:05.828 --> 01:01:07.096
SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE IS

01:01:07.163 --> 01:01:09.465
TRUE MYSELF. I ALSO THINK

01:01:09.532 --> 01:01:10.566
EQUITY IS REALLY IMPORTANT HERE

01:01:10.633 --> 01:01:12.935
BECAUSE- YEAH I BELIEVE THE

01:01:13.002 --> 01:01:13.803
RESEARCH SHOWS AND THIS IS

01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:15.338
CERTAINLY MY EXPERIENCE WITH

01:01:15.405 --> 01:01:17.840
ONLINE TEACHING. THAT IN PERSON

01:01:17.907 --> 01:01:19.475
INSTRUCTION ALLOWS YOU TO

01:01:19.542 --> 01:01:20.676
CREATE MORE EQUITABLE OUTCOMES

01:01:20.743 --> 01:01:22.245
IN ONLINE LEARNING WHICH HAS

01:01:22.311 --> 01:01:24.047
DISPROPORTIONATELY BAD IMPACTS

01:01:24.113 --> 01:01:26.282
ON LOW INCOME. NONTRADITIONAL

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:27.316
AND FIRST TIME STUDENTS WHO ARE

01:01:27.383 --> 01:01:29.318
ALREADY YOU KNOW HAVING A

01:01:29.385 --> 01:01:29.919
NUMBER OF CHALLENGES THEY'RE

01:01:29.986 --> 01:01:32.822
FACING. SO I GUESS MY QUESTION

01:01:32.889 --> 01:01:34.323
YOU ISSUES ONE OF THE POLICY

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:36.259
RATIONALES. FOR THIS

01:01:36.325 --> 01:01:38.327
REQUIREMENT AND CAN YOU OUTLINE

01:01:38.394 --> 01:01:39.796
FOR US THE EVIDENCE AND DATA

01:01:39.862 --> 01:01:43.266
SUPPORTING. THE IDEA THAT THIS

01:01:43.332 --> 01:01:47.303
10% INCREASE IN ONLINE.

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:47.870
EDUCATION WOULD SUPPORT YOUR

01:01:47.937 --> 01:01:48.905
POLICY. THANK YOU FOR THE

01:01:48.971 --> 01:01:51.741
QUESTIONS SENATOR MANDATE. THE

01:01:51.808 --> 01:01:54.210
ADMINISTRATION'S PERSPECTIVE IS

01:01:54.277 --> 01:01:57.380
FIRST THE PROPOSAL IS A BERMAN

01:01:57.447 --> 01:02:00.016
EQUITY IN ACCESS LANDS FOCUSED

01:02:00.083 --> 01:02:01.984
FIRST ON THE STUDENTS WE DO

01:02:02.051 --> 01:02:04.587
ACKNOWLEDGE. OUR RANGE OF

01:02:04.654 --> 01:02:06.556
OPINIONS AND CHALLENGES THAT

01:02:06.622 --> 01:02:08.624
FACULTY AND EVERYONE HAVE FACED

01:02:08.691 --> 01:02:09.158
IN A SPECIALLY IN THE CODE

01:02:09.225 --> 01:02:11.794
ENVIRONMENT- THOSE ARE WIDELY

01:02:11.861 --> 01:02:13.963
REPORTED IN THE NEWS. BUT THE

01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:16.232
POLICY RATIONALE IS FIRST IF

01:02:16.299 --> 01:02:18.101
YOU THINK ABOUT STUDENTS FIRST

01:02:18.167 --> 01:02:19.936
AND YOU GO STATEWIDE NOT JUST

01:02:20.002 --> 01:02:22.004
IN THE UC SYSTEM BUT THE CCC'S

01:02:22.071 --> 01:02:24.941
THE CSU'S. THERE'S A WIDE RANGE

01:02:25.007 --> 01:02:26.876
OF GEOGRAPHICAL AND FINANCIAL

01:02:26.943 --> 01:02:30.379
PRESSURES. THAT THAT ESPECIALLY

01:02:30.446 --> 01:02:33.015
NONTRADITIONAL ON UNDER

01:02:33.082 --> 01:02:35.518
REPRESENTED STUDENTS FACE. SO

01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:37.753
THE GOAL IS TAKE TO CREATE MORE

01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:39.455
FLEXIBILITY AND FREEDOM FROM A

01:02:39.522 --> 01:02:41.424
STUDENT'S PERSPECTIVE SO IF YOU

01:02:41.491 --> 01:02:44.827
HAVE TWELVE UNITS NOW SAY. AND

01:02:44.894 --> 01:02:46.262
AN ONLINE COURSE WOULD ALLOW

01:02:46.329 --> 01:02:48.464
YOU TO MAYBE TAKE THAT THAT ONE

01:02:48.531 --> 01:02:51.000
MORE COURSE FOR FIFTEEN UNITS

01:02:51.067 --> 01:02:52.568
DURING A SEMESTER FOR EXAMPLE

01:02:52.635 --> 01:02:54.003
THAT'S GOING TO BE DRAMATICALLY

01:02:54.070 --> 01:02:55.171
HELP MORE HELPFUL IN HELPING

01:02:55.238 --> 01:02:56.873
YOU MOVE THROUGH FOR THE

01:02:56.939 --> 01:02:59.408
DEGREE. I CUT YOUR COSTS OVER

01:02:59.475 --> 01:03:01.144
TIME OF HOW MUCH IT YOU KNOW IT

01:03:01.210 --> 01:03:02.812
COST YOU TO GET THAT DEGREE AND

01:03:02.879 --> 01:03:04.947
THERE'S ALL SORTS OF INDIVIDUAL

01:03:05.014 --> 01:03:06.048
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE NOW HAVE.

01:03:06.115 --> 01:03:07.650
THERE WAIT ON STUDENTS BEFORE

01:03:07.717 --> 01:03:10.419
COVERED THE COATED COVERED HAS

01:03:10.486 --> 01:03:12.822
NOW MADE WORSE. AND SO WHAT

01:03:12.889 --> 01:03:13.856
WE'RE PROPOSING NOT JUST WITH

01:03:13.923 --> 01:03:15.725
YOU SEE BUT WITH THE ALL THE

01:03:15.791 --> 01:03:17.827
SEGMENTS. IS THAT NOW THAT

01:03:17.894 --> 01:03:20.763
WE'VE PROVEN AS INSTITUTIONS WE

01:03:20.830 --> 01:03:23.766
HAVE THE CAPACITY TO HAVE. OUR

01:03:23.833 --> 01:03:26.135
ONLINE COURSES BROADLY. WE

01:03:26.202 --> 01:03:28.571
SHOULD PRESERVE SOME OF THAT SO

01:03:28.638 --> 01:03:30.606
THAT GOING FORWARD ESPECIALLY

01:03:30.673 --> 01:03:32.041
THE NONTRADITIONAL AND

01:03:32.108 --> 01:03:33.209
UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS WHO

01:03:33.276 --> 01:03:35.378
FACE. DISPROPORTIONATE LEVELS

01:03:35.444 --> 01:03:37.079
OF THESE THESE PRESSURES ON

01:03:37.146 --> 01:03:38.781
THEIR FLEXIBILITY. THAT THEY

01:03:38.848 --> 01:03:40.816
HAVE ACCESS NOT JUST TO YOU SEE

01:03:40.883 --> 01:03:43.653
WHAT AT THE CSU IN CCC'S.

01:03:43.719 --> 01:03:46.722
ONLINE OFFERINGS. IT SO THAT IN

01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:47.924
THESE CASES THEY CAN THEY CAN

01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:52.061
TAKE MORE UNITS OR HAVE ACCESS

01:03:52.128 --> 01:03:54.497
AND GET THROUGH. SO TO THE TO

01:03:54.564 --> 01:03:56.465
THE POINT ABOUT THE QUALITY I

01:03:56.532 --> 01:03:58.434
DON'T HAVE THE SPECIFIC DATA ON

01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:01.270
HAND BUT THE CCC'S WHO HAVE

01:04:01.337 --> 01:04:03.973
TRADITIONALLY SERVED. THE MOST

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:05.341
NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN THE

01:04:05.408 --> 01:04:07.476
BIGGEST PROPORTION ONLINE. THEY

01:04:07.543 --> 01:04:09.245
HAVE DONE RESEARCH AND NOTED

01:04:09.312 --> 01:04:12.682
THAT. ABOUT A DECADE AGO THE-

01:04:12.748 --> 01:04:14.250
THE STUDENT PERFORMANCE THIS

01:04:14.317 --> 01:04:16.252
THE ACADEMIC OUTCOMES WERE

01:04:16.319 --> 01:04:18.321
WORKING THERE'S A GAP BETWEEN

01:04:18.387 --> 01:04:20.189
IN PERSON AND ONLINE THAT GAP

01:04:20.256 --> 01:04:22.391
IS SUBSTANTIALLY CLOSE TO

01:04:22.458 --> 01:04:24.994
ALMOST. OUR EQUALS SUCCESS IN

01:04:25.061 --> 01:04:27.196
ONLINE COURSES AND NOW THAT

01:04:27.263 --> 01:04:28.931
THEY'VE HAD A DECADE OF REALLY

01:04:28.998 --> 01:04:30.633
FOCUSING ON DEVELOPING IT AND

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:31.534
SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS

01:04:31.601 --> 01:04:33.102
WE'VE KEPT IN MIND WHEN TRYING

01:04:33.169 --> 01:04:35.004
TO EMPHASIZE THAT. ONLINE

01:04:35.071 --> 01:04:36.172
SHOULD BE PART OF THE MIX GOING

01:04:36.239 --> 01:04:38.341
FORWARD SO CUT THAT I'LL CUT IT

01:04:38.407 --> 01:04:39.775
OFF RIGHT THERE BUT I HOPE THAT

01:04:39.842 --> 01:04:41.244
ANSWERS YOUR QUESTIONS AND- I

01:04:41.310 --> 01:04:42.378
MEAN IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T I

01:04:42.445 --> 01:04:44.313
JUST I GUESS I DIDN'T HEAR ANY

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:45.915
EVIDENCE TO MY AND I THE

01:04:45.982 --> 01:04:47.016
CONCERN I HAVE RUN EQUITY WHICH

01:04:47.083 --> 01:04:48.451
IS. YOU KNOW MY BELIEF AND

01:04:48.517 --> 01:04:49.986
CERTAINLY A NUMBER OF OTHER

01:04:50.052 --> 01:04:51.487
FACULTY THAT I'VE TALKED WITH

01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:53.856
SHARE THIS VIEW THAT- ONLINE

01:04:53.923 --> 01:04:55.291
LEARNING IS BAD BUT IT'S

01:04:55.358 --> 01:04:57.526
PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC FOR A

01:04:57.593 --> 01:04:59.528
NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS. WHO

01:04:59.595 --> 01:05:01.097
FACE MANY MORE CHALLENGES AND

01:05:01.163 --> 01:05:03.366

NOT ONLY GUARANTEE OF ADMISSION

01:13:34.710 --> 01:13:35.644

01:13:35.711 --> 01:13:37.279
SAYS. THESE ARE THE

01:13:37.346 --> 01:13:38.313

OF THEIR MINIMUM EXPECTATION

01:14:02.271 --> 01:14:04.139
IS. BUT OF COURSE. YOU KNOW

01:14:04.206 --> 01:14:06.608

HEARING MORE ABOUT THIS.

01:14:20.222 --> 01:14:22.057
PROGRAM BUT- IT WOULDN'T BE

01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:23.759
MORE DIRECT IF THE GOALS ARE

01:14:23.826 --> 01:14:25.394
EQUITY IS FINDING LOCAL

TO JUST TACK ON AS DALY-

01:14:30.766 --> 01:14:32.067
SUGGESTS TO THE EXISTING

WANT WOULDN'T THAT BE EASIER.

01:14:47.049 --> 01:14:48.517
AND AVOID SOME OF THAT MAYBE

01:14:48.584 --> 01:14:50.519
MORAL HAZARD IN IN SORT OF

01:14:50.586 --> 01:14:52.754
OTHER PROBLEMS THAT MIGHT. BE A

01:14:52.821 --> 01:14:54.256
CORD WITH THE APPROACH

01:15:01.230 --> 01:15:04.132
SEEMS LIKE THAT MIGHT BE MORE

01:15:04.199 --> 01:15:05.200
STRAIGHTFORWARD RIGHT.

01:15:05.267 --> 01:15:09.605
ENGINEERS BECAUSE THAT YOU GUYS

FRESHMAN RATIO WHICH THEY HAVE

01:15:17.546 --> 01:15:21.683
BEEN ADHERING TO- WE WOULD NOTE

01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:25.320
THERE ARE SOME SOME. BUT THERE

01:15:25.387 --> 01:15:26.655
IS SOME COMPLEXITY IN TERMS OF

01:15:26.722 --> 01:15:28.090
PROPOSITION TWO OH NINE

01:15:28.156 --> 01:15:29.625
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION I'M

01:15:29.691 --> 01:15:32.194
LIMITATION ON THE UNIVERSITY OF

CASES WOULD NOT BE PERMISSIBLE.

01:15:45.841 --> 01:15:47.776

THE COMMITTEE FOR

01:23:11.186 --> 01:23:12.921
CONSIDERATION. THE FIRST IS

01:23:12.987 --> 01:23:15.790
THAT- A FEW WEEKS AGO AT THE IN

01:23:15.857 --> 01:23:17.058

THAT ANALYSIS IN OUR SPENDING

01:23:28.503 --> 01:23:31.706
WOULD GROW TO SEVENTY NINE

01:23:31.773 --> 01:23:32.307
MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET

01:23:32.374 --> 01:23:34.109

01:23:44.619 --> 01:23:45.820
POINT SIX MILLION SO THERE'S A

01:23:45.887 --> 01:23:47.555
BIT OF A GAP THERE- IF THE

01:23:47.622 --> 01:23:49.157
LEGISLATURE WERE INTERESTED IN

01:23:49.224 --> 01:23:50.392

THEY'RE A MIX OF. ISSUES THAT

01:24:02.237 --> 01:24:03.438
ARE SOME OF THEM ARE MORE

01:24:03.505 --> 01:24:04.406
DISCRETIONARY SOME OF THE MOST

01:24:04.472 --> 01:24:05.840
DISCRETIONARY SO LEGISLATURE

01:24:05.907 --> 01:24:07.409
COULD WEIGH THOSE ISSUES WE

01:24:07.475 --> 01:24:09.110
ALSO FOUND THAT A WIN THAT

01:24:15.683 --> 01:24:20.455
OF INFLATION SO I GET. TO BE

01:24:20.522 --> 01:24:21.022

01:26:15.803 --> 01:26:18.406
TO YEAR AND IT SEEMS LIKE ARE

01:26:18.473 --> 01:26:19.707
NOW ALSO THIS IS ALL IN TERMS

01:26:19.774 --> 01:26:21.843
OF. WHAT THE MONEY IS IN THE

01:26:21.910 --> 01:26:23.177
MONEY BEING FLAT AND WHEN IT'S

01:26:23.244 --> 01:26:25.179
FLAT THAT MEANS IT'S A CUT

01:26:25.246 --> 01:26:27.549
EVERY YEAR BY INFLATION AND

01:26:27.615 --> 01:26:29.584
THEY'RE BEEN VACANCIES. ANSWER

01:26:29.651 --> 01:26:31.519
YOUR VACANCIES AND YOU HAVE

01:26:31.586 --> 01:26:33.254
FLAT MONEY AND YOU HAVE

01:26:33.321 --> 01:26:35.423
EXCEEDING DEMANDS AND IT SEEMS

01:26:35.490 --> 01:26:36.758
LIKE IT'S ALL ABOUT THE MONEY.

01:26:36.824 --> 01:26:38.293
BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY KIND OF

01:26:38.359 --> 01:26:40.428
ANALYSIS OF WHETHER WE'RE

01:26:40.495 --> 01:26:41.930
REALLY MEETING THAT DEMAND AND

01:26:41.996 --> 01:26:43.231
THEN IT FEEDS INTO WHAT THE L.

01:26:43.298 --> 01:26:45.967
A. O. JUST SAID. WHICH IS THIS

01:26:46.034 --> 01:26:48.770
DEPENDS ON THE CAMPUSES ARE

01:26:48.836 --> 01:26:51.339
PAYING IN SO THIS EXTERNAL

01:26:51.406 --> 01:26:52.607
RESEARCH THAT IS REALLY OF

01:26:52.674 --> 01:26:54.509
BENEFIT COMPETES AGAINST

01:26:54.576 --> 01:26:56.744
INTERNAL CAMPUS THINGS AND ED

01:26:56.811 --> 01:26:58.446
IN MY POLITICAL UNDERSTANDING

01:26:58.513 --> 01:27:00.048
WOULD BE THE INTERNAL CAMPUS

01:27:00.114 --> 01:27:01.783
THINGS WOULD ALWAYS WIN. THIS

01:27:01.849 --> 01:27:04.252
SO HOW DO WE ADDRESS THE ISSUE

01:27:04.319 --> 01:27:05.820
OF THE FACT THAT COOPERATIVE

01:27:05.887 --> 01:27:07.055
EXTENSION ISN'T REALLY

01:27:07.121 --> 01:27:08.690
ADDRESSING THE FORMALLY THAT'S

01:27:08.756 --> 01:27:13.528
BEING IDENTIFIED BY ITS- ITS

01:27:13.595 --> 01:27:14.662

A. N. R. RECEIVED ITS OWN LINE

01:27:32.914 --> 01:27:35.650
ITEM- WHICH WAS FLAT AND THEN

01:27:35.717 --> 01:27:37.385
LIKE THIS IN THE CURRENT YEAR

01:27:37.452 --> 01:27:39.120
REDUCED DRAMATICALLY DUE TO THE

01:27:39.187 --> 01:27:42.690
STATE BUDGET CUTS- WHEN THE

01:27:42.757 --> 01:27:44.125
LEGISLATURE LINE ITEMS A

01:27:44.192 --> 01:27:46.060
PARTICULAR FUNCTION WITHIN THE

01:27:46.127 --> 01:27:50.832
UNIVERSITY OF WE'RE NOT ABLE TO

01:27:50.898 --> 01:27:51.833
ALTER THAT AMOUNT OF FUNDING.

01:27:51.899 --> 01:27:53.968
EIGHT EIGHT DIVISH STILL HAS

01:27:54.035 --> 01:27:57.538
COST INCREASES THAT ARE- THAT.

01:27:57.605 --> 01:27:59.907
UNIVERSITY IMPOSES OR THAT WE

01:27:59.974 --> 01:28:02.977
CAN NEGOTIATE OF THAT GREAT BUT

01:28:03.044 --> 01:28:05.580
ARE NOT THURMOND BUT ARE NOT

01:28:05.647 --> 01:28:08.049
MANDATORY RIGHT. I'M JUST

01:28:08.116 --> 01:28:15.690
KIDDING I AM. I WAS COST OF

01:28:15.757 --> 01:28:18.359
LIVING INCREASE SAYS YOU HAVE-

01:28:18.426 --> 01:28:19.961
NON SALARY COST INCREASES YOU

01:28:20.028 --> 01:28:23.231
HAVE LOST INCREASES FOR UP YOUR

01:28:23.297 --> 01:28:24.399
YOU KNOW LET ME ASK THE

01:28:24.465 --> 01:28:25.900
QUESTION A DIFFERENT WAY

01:28:25.967 --> 01:28:27.335
BECAUSE I THINK SOME OF THE

01:28:27.402 --> 01:28:29.137
ACTIONS IS JUST MY SPECULATION

01:28:29.203 --> 01:28:30.938
WERE TAKEN BY THE LEGISLATURE

01:28:31.005 --> 01:28:32.674
BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO SEE.

01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:35.243
THIS PROGRAM INCREASE AND IT

01:28:35.309 --> 01:28:37.445
MAY HAVE HAD A COUNTER

01:28:37.512 --> 01:28:40.214
INTUITIVE- COUNTER. RESULT SO

01:28:40.281 --> 01:28:44.218
WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO GET

01:28:44.285 --> 01:28:46.154
INCREASES IN THIS PROGRAM TO

01:28:46.220 --> 01:28:48.389
MEET THE DEMANDS GIVEN ALL THE

01:28:48.456 --> 01:28:50.191
THINGS THAT WERE SAYING ABOUT.

01:28:50.258 --> 01:28:51.993
LINE ITEM NOT LINE ITEM BILLING

01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:53.494
THAT CAMPUS IS NOT GOING TO

01:28:53.561 --> 01:28:56.731
CAMPUSES WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO

01:28:56.798 --> 01:28:58.833
GET AN INCREASE FOR THIS- TO

01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:00.935
POTENTIAL ACTIONS THAT I SEE

01:29:01.002 --> 01:29:02.670
FOR YOU SIR YOU COULD INCREASE

01:29:02.737 --> 01:29:04.205
THE DOLLAR AMOUNT IN THE A AND

01:29:04.272 --> 01:29:06.441
R. LINE ITEM. IN ORDER TO

01:29:06.507 --> 01:29:07.742
PROVIDE THEM WITH ADDITIONAL

01:29:07.809 --> 01:29:09.477
FUNDING FOR CERTAIN ACTIVITIES

01:29:09.544 --> 01:29:11.312
THAT YOU WANT THEM TO UNDERTAKE

01:29:11.379 --> 01:29:13.414
SUCH AS THE PAST MANAGEMENT-

01:29:13.481 --> 01:29:15.783
YOU COULD THEN YOU COULD ALSO

01:29:15.850 --> 01:29:18.653
MOVE ALL OF YOU C. O. P. OFF

01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:20.455
THE LINE ITEM. GIVE ALL THAT

01:29:20.521 --> 01:29:22.490
GENERAL FUND BACK TO THE

01:29:22.557 --> 01:29:24.759
CAMPUSES AND THEN THE CAMPUS IS

01:29:24.826 --> 01:29:26.227
COULD USE A MIX OF FUNDING

01:29:26.294 --> 01:29:28.830
SOURCES TO FIND YOU SEE- PAGE

01:29:28.896 --> 01:29:29.797
WHICH WOULD ACTUALLY GIVE THE

01:29:29.864 --> 01:29:31.532
CAMPUSES MORE STATE GENERAL

01:29:31.599 --> 01:29:33.701
FUND. FOR INSTRUCTIONAL

01:29:33.768 --> 01:29:35.436
PURPOSES AND THEY MAY BE MORE

01:29:35.503 --> 01:29:37.438
WILLING TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO

01:29:37.505 --> 01:29:39.240
USE YOUR PH CURRENTLY THE

01:29:39.307 --> 01:29:41.309
HOSPITAL SYSTEMS ARE NOT BEING

01:29:41.375 --> 01:29:44.345
CHARGED- THROUGH THE ASSESSMENT

01:29:44.412 --> 01:29:46.614
WHICH WE USED TO HAVE. FOR THE

01:29:46.681 --> 01:29:49.484
OPERATIONS OF U. C. O. P. AND

01:29:49.550 --> 01:29:50.918
WE DO PROVIDE QUITE A BIT OF

01:29:50.985 --> 01:29:52.453
SERVICES FOR THE HOSPITAL

01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:55.757
SYSTEM SO- IF WE WERE TO MOVE

01:29:55.823 --> 01:29:57.191
BACK TO THE CAMPUS ASSESSMENT

01:29:57.258 --> 01:29:58.359
BECAUSE THE CAMPUS IS WOULD USE

01:29:58.426 --> 01:29:59.894
THE MULTITUDE OF FUNDING

01:29:59.961 --> 01:30:01.996
SOURCES. IT COULD ACTUALLY

01:30:02.063 --> 01:30:03.965
ALLOW US TO INCREASE THE BUDGET

01:30:04.031 --> 01:30:05.600
FOR A AND R. I KNOW THAT WOULD

01:30:05.666 --> 01:30:08.669
MEET YOUR CARNAL DESIRES AND IT

01:30:08.736 --> 01:30:10.037
SOUNDS LIKE WE WOULD HAVE TO

01:30:10.104 --> 01:30:11.038
DEPEND ON THE KINDNESS OF

01:30:11.105 --> 01:30:12.974
STRANGERS TO DETERMINE WHETHER

01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:14.275
OR NOT THERE WOULD ACTUALLY BE

01:30:14.342 --> 01:30:16.210
AN INCREASE WELL WE JUST MOVED

01:30:16.277 --> 01:30:18.412
BACK TO CAMPUS SO. I THINK I

01:30:18.479 --> 01:30:20.882
WOULD JUST SUGGEST THAT BETWEEN

01:30:20.948 --> 01:30:23.184
NOW AND THE MAY REVISE IT WOULD

01:30:23.251 --> 01:30:25.086
BE WONDERFUL TO FIND A WAY THAT

01:30:25.153 --> 01:30:26.921
ACTUALLY ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE

01:30:26.988 --> 01:30:28.723
WITH CERTAINTY RATHER THAN

01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:30.625
CHANGES THE PROCESS AND THEN WE

01:30:30.691 --> 01:30:32.894
SEE WHAT THE CAMPUSES DO. IT

01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:35.196
BECAUSE THE REAL ISSUE IS LACK

01:30:35.263 --> 01:30:37.365
OF RESEARCH AND A NOT FOR

01:30:37.431 --> 01:30:39.700
RESEARCH A. M. THE QUESTION IS

01:30:39.767 --> 01:30:41.435
WHETHER THERE NEEDS TO BE A

01:30:41.502 --> 01:30:43.271
COST OF LIVING INCREASE WHETHER

01:30:43.337 --> 01:30:45.039
VACANCIES NEED TO BE FILLED. ON

01:30:45.106 --> 01:30:45.907
WHETHER THERE NEEDS TO BE A

01:30:45.973 --> 01:30:48.342
FLAT OUT INCREASE BUT I THINK

01:30:48.409 --> 01:30:50.745
BEFORE WE DID IT EVEN THOUGH IF

01:30:50.812 --> 01:30:52.713
YOU'RE HEARING THERE'S A DESIRE

01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:53.781
WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THERE'S

01:30:53.848 --> 01:30:54.448
ACTUALLY GOING TO BE AN

01:30:54.515 --> 01:31:01.289
OUTCOME- THAT THAT THE TAXI

01:31:01.355 --> 01:31:01.923
GOING TO LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN

01:31:01.989 --> 01:31:02.790
RATES. IF WE DID AND I'M THE

01:31:02.857 --> 01:31:03.391
ONLY ONE THAT'S TALK ABOUT THE

01:31:03.457 --> 01:31:05.359
STRESSFUL BUT- I JUST. THAT IF

01:31:05.426 --> 01:31:06.194
YOU WANT TO THE MORE RURAL

01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:07.829
AREAS OF CALIFORNIA NEAR

01:31:07.895 --> 01:31:09.363
UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES OR THAT

01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:11.399
HAVE COOPERATIVE EXTENSION DAY

01:31:11.465 --> 01:31:12.133
WOULD FEEL STRONGLY TO SAY

01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:14.602
MORE. SO ARE WE JUST LEAVE IT

01:31:14.669 --> 01:31:17.138
AT THAT BUT- BUT JUST I HAVE

01:31:17.205 --> 01:31:18.272
CLEARLY NOTED THE ISSUE AND

01:31:18.339 --> 01:31:20.007
HOPEFULLY PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT.

01:31:20.074 --> 01:31:21.175

THE PRIMARY HAVE MANY. MISSIONS

01:48:53.593 --> 01:48:56.529
AVERAGE FOCUS ON HEALTHCARE.

01:48:56.596 --> 01:48:57.530
OTHERS ARE TARGET TOWARDS ISSUE

01:48:57.597 --> 01:48:59.566
LIKE OUR FOCUS ON THE SAME

01:48:59.633 --> 01:49:02.569
JOAQUIN. FOCUSING ON ON THE

01:49:02.636 --> 01:49:05.872
CERTAIN LINE AND GRAPHIC. GROUP

01:49:05.939 --> 01:49:06.373
ARE BUT THEY KNOW SEEM

01:49:06.439 --> 01:49:08.942
ACCORDINGLY AND BE OF THAT A DE-

01:49:09.009 --> 01:49:16.549
YOU KNOW REMAINING OR IN USE-

01:49:16.616 --> 01:49:17.150
EIGHT. PROGRAMMING ADDITIONAL

01:49:17.217 --> 01:49:19.719
CAL REGION ARE CAN YOU. ARE

01:49:19.786 --> 01:49:23.590
BEING LEFT A DRAFT. YOU SEE

01:49:23.657 --> 01:49:24.224
ALSO LACKS A LONG TERM- PLANETS

01:49:24.291 --> 01:49:27.260
OVER BETTER. SCHOOL IN THE- YOU

01:49:27.327 --> 01:49:28.295
THOUGH THAT'S NOT MY PERCENT

01:49:28.361 --> 01:49:28.929
ITS MEDIC SCHOOL. AND SO IT'S

01:49:28.995 --> 01:49:35.101
HARD TO KNOW HOW IT'S PLANS.

01:49:35.168 --> 01:49:35.669
HEALTH PLAN TO ADDRESS THE

01:49:35.735 --> 01:49:36.269
PROJECT SHORTAGES IN PRIMARY

01:49:36.336 --> 01:49:38.438
CARE BECAUSE THAT SEE- A LITTLE

01:49:38.505 --> 01:49:41.741
TOO EARLIER. OUR SECOND. BOB OF

01:49:41.808 --> 01:49:47.480
CONCERNS ARMS THE BUDGET. THAT

01:49:47.547 --> 01:49:50.417
THE IS PER TO TAKE AND YOU AS.

01:49:50.483 --> 01:49:51.084
EXAMPLE OF THE IMAGE IS PER TO

01:49:51.151 --> 01:49:54.554
PROVIDE ALL. THE FUNDING FOR

01:49:54.621 --> 01:49:58.024
PRIME UP FOR IN THE BY YEAR.

01:49:58.091 --> 01:49:58.625
EVEN THOUGH MUCH OF THE WATER

01:49:58.692 --> 01:50:03.363
OR THE NEXT. PAGE NOT ONLY DO

01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:04.497
WE THINK PROVIDING UP FRONT UP

01:50:04.564 --> 01:50:06.132
FRONT UP FRONT FUNDING IS

01:50:06.199 --> 01:50:07.934
INEFFICIENT IN THAT IT PROVIDES

01:50:08.001 --> 01:50:08.868
FUNDS AND SOME YEARS WERE LIKE

01:50:08.935 --> 01:50:11.104
HOT WEATHER COSTS HAVE BEEN

01:50:11.171 --> 01:50:12.238
INCURRED YET ON BUT ALSO

01:50:12.305 --> 01:50:13.606
WEAENS LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT

01:50:13.673 --> 01:50:15.241
OVER THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

01:50:15.308 --> 01:50:17.310
THESE FUNDS. AND HERE WE THINK

01:50:17.377 --> 01:50:18.578
THE STATE'S EXPERIENCE OF SAN

01:50:18.645 --> 01:50:20.680
JOAQUIN VALLEY PRIME- PROVIDES

01:50:20.747 --> 01:50:25.185
AND ARE USEFUL EXAMPLE ON IN

01:50:25.251 --> 01:50:25.752
TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THE

01:50:25.819 --> 01:50:26.286
STATE PROVIDED SAN JOAQUIN

01:50:26.353 --> 01:50:29.189
VALLEY PRIME- FUNDS UP FRONT

01:50:29.255 --> 01:50:30.724
FOR FORTY EIGHT STUDENTS ON

01:50:30.790 --> 01:50:31.791
WHAT THE PROGRAM IS HAD SOME

01:50:31.858 --> 01:50:33.727
IMPLEMENTATION DELAYS AND

01:50:33.793 --> 01:50:35.595
CURRENTLY ENROLLS THIRTY SIX

01:50:35.662 --> 01:50:37.831
STUDENTS- IT DOESN'T ANTICIPATE

01:50:37.897 --> 01:50:39.232
HITTING THAT FORTY EIGHT

01:50:39.299 --> 01:50:43.236
STUDENTS ARE MARKING TOLD. A

01:50:43.303 --> 01:50:44.504
UNTIL A FEW YEARS FROM NOW.

01:50:44.571 --> 01:50:46.006
REGIONALLY THE LAW. TO WHITE TO

01:50:46.072 --> 01:50:47.540
HAVE IT. ON ON THE EMPLOYMENT

01:50:47.607 --> 01:50:49.275
CHALLENGES BY PROVIDING THE

01:50:49.342 --> 01:50:50.377
FUNDS ALL FRENCH MISSING

01:50:50.443 --> 01:50:51.678
OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO

01:50:51.745 --> 01:50:54.214
REVIEW THESE PLANS ANNUALLY AS

01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:56.082
PART OF THE BUDGET PROCESS.

01:50:56.149 --> 01:50:57.617
YEAH THAT'S WE JUST ONE ISSUE

01:50:57.684 --> 01:50:58.952
WE HAVE THE BUDGET APPROACH WE

01:50:59.019 --> 01:51:00.653
HAVE SEVERAL OTHER CONCERNS

01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:01.788
WITHOUT. PER STUDENT FUNDING

01:51:01.855 --> 01:51:03.990
RATE THAT YOU SEE IS PROPOSING

01:51:04.057 --> 01:51:05.392
OF THE LACK OF ENROLLMENT

01:51:05.458 --> 01:51:07.427
TARGETS IN THE IN THE- PROPOSED

01:51:07.494 --> 01:51:09.462
BUDGET BILL AND ALSO THE LACK

01:51:09.529 --> 01:51:11.064
OF REGULAR REPORTING ON TO

01:51:11.131 --> 01:51:12.399
ASSESS THE OUTCOMES OF THE

01:51:12.465 --> 01:51:13.933
PROGRAM AND TO ENSURE THAT THE

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.036
PROGRAM IS- OPERATING

01:51:16.102 --> 01:51:18.204
EFFECTIVELY. SH THE FINAL

01:51:18.271 --> 01:51:19.472
BUDGET OF OUR CONCERNS ARE

01:51:19.539 --> 01:51:21.441
AROUND THE FACT IS THAT A

01:51:21.508 --> 01:51:22.609
SIZABLE PORTION OF THESE FUNDS

01:51:22.675 --> 01:51:24.144
ARE INTENDED ARE INTENDED TO

01:51:24.210 --> 01:51:25.645
BOLSTER SUPPORT FOR EXISTING

01:51:25.712 --> 01:51:26.679
ENROLLMENT DATA EXISTING

01:51:26.746 --> 01:51:29.449
PROGRAMS. RATHER THAN FINDING

01:51:29.516 --> 01:51:32.452
NEW ENROLLMENT GROWTH. THIS IS

01:51:32.519 --> 01:51:33.686
A MIXED THAT THERE COULD BE

01:51:33.753 --> 01:51:35.321
SOME JUSTIFICATION FOR EXAMPLE

01:51:35.388 --> 01:51:36.356
THE ADMINISTRATION IN THE

01:51:36.423 --> 01:51:37.791
UNIVERSITY NOTE THAT SOME OF

01:51:37.857 --> 01:51:39.526
THIS FUNDING WOULD BE TO-

01:51:39.592 --> 01:51:40.593
BOLSTER FINANCIAL AID FOR

01:51:40.660 --> 01:51:41.461
STUDENTS AND ADDRESS THEIR

01:51:41.528 --> 01:51:43.163
STUDENT DEBT LEVELS. WE THINK

01:51:43.229 --> 01:51:44.197
THIS IS PROTECT POTENTIALLY

01:51:44.264 --> 01:51:45.432
REASONABLE BUT THE UNIVERSITY

01:51:45.498 --> 01:51:47.567
HASN'T PROVIDED A FULL ESTIMATE

01:51:47.634 --> 01:51:49.402
OF STUDENTS NEED. ON THE

01:51:49.469 --> 01:51:50.703
BECAUSE OF THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:51:50.770 --> 01:51:51.838
LITTLE BASIS TO DETERMINE

01:51:51.905 --> 01:51:53.239
WHETHER THE PROPOSED ONE THIRD

01:51:53.306 --> 01:51:55.442
SATISFIED IS THE CORRECT AMOUNT

01:51:55.508 --> 01:51:59.479
TO. ADDRESS STUDENT DEBT LEVELS.

01:51:59.546 --> 01:52:01.815
FURTHERMORE I SIDLE PORTION OF

01:52:01.881 --> 01:52:03.516
THIS. WOULDN'T BE FOR FINANCIAL

01:52:03.583 --> 01:52:05.618
DATED BEFORE OTHER RESTORATION

01:52:05.685 --> 01:52:06.252
AND HERE WE THINK THE

01:52:06.319 --> 01:52:07.654
UNIVERSITY HAS NOT PROVIDED

01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:09.189
ENOUGH JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS

01:52:09.255 --> 01:52:10.123
WEEK WE THINK THIS COULD BE

01:52:10.190 --> 01:52:11.958
AMONG THE LEGISLATURE'S. LOWER

01:52:12.025 --> 01:52:13.493
PRIORITIES IN THIS PARTICULAR

01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:15.662
PROPOSAL. ALTHOUGH THAT IN

01:52:15.728 --> 01:52:18.231
MIND- WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE

01:52:18.298 --> 01:52:20.700
COULD TAKE SEVERAL STOPS- HELP

01:52:20.767 --> 01:52:22.001
ADDRESS THAT ADDRESS OUR

01:52:22.068 --> 01:52:24.604
CONCERNS. ONE IS TO DIRECT THE

01:52:24.671 --> 01:52:26.339
ADMINISTRATION AND YOU SEE TO

01:52:26.406 --> 01:52:29.576
ESTIMATE. OF BETTER PROPOSALS

01:52:29.642 --> 01:52:30.777
THE LEGISLATURE. BETTER

01:52:30.844 --> 01:52:32.645
PROPOSAL HAVE LONG PLANNING TO

01:52:32.712 --> 01:52:33.880
ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS I

01:52:33.947 --> 01:52:35.448
DESCRIBED EARLIER WOULD HAVE A

01:52:35.515 --> 01:52:37.183
BETTER PER STUDENT FUNDING RATE

01:52:37.250 --> 01:52:38.418
FOR EXAMPLE. AND WHAT THESE

01:52:38.485 --> 01:52:39.719
BETTER PLANS IN PLACE WITHIN

01:52:39.786 --> 01:52:40.887
THE LEGISLATURE COULD TAKE ITS

01:52:40.954 --> 01:52:41.721
OWN APPROACH TO SUPPORTING

01:52:41.788 --> 01:52:44.724
PRIME ONE THAT- INSURERS IT HAS

01:52:44.791 --> 01:52:47.127
A PROPER OVERSIGHT OVER THE

01:52:47.193 --> 01:52:49.696
IMPLEMENTATION OF. PROPOSAL FOR

01:52:49.762 --> 01:52:53.433
EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE- SPREAD

01:52:53.500 --> 01:52:55.135
GROWTH OCCURS THE LEGISLATURE

01:52:55.201 --> 01:52:56.803
CAN GET ADDITIONAL REPORTING ON

01:52:56.870 --> 01:53:00.640
OUTCOMES- TO IN TO ASSESS THE

01:53:00.707 --> 01:53:01.875
SUCCESS OF THIS PROGRAM. SECOND

01:53:01.941 --> 01:53:03.109
I KNOW THAT WAS A LOT OF HAPPY

01:53:03.176 --> 01:53:04.878
TO ELABORATE FURTHER IN THE Q.

01:53:04.944 --> 01:53:06.479

01:53:06.546 --> 01:53:09.749
MATTERS. ARMY JUST OF. THANK

IN THE- THE VC SAID THEY'RE

01:53:18.725 --> 01:53:20.260
GOING TO RESPOND TO COMMENTS

THEORY OF YOU SEE PRIME BUT

01:53:39.112 --> 01:53:41.614
IT'S REALLY HARD TO JUDGE THIS

01:53:41.681 --> 01:53:43.016
FROM ANY KIND OF COST BENEFIT

01:53:43.082 --> 01:53:44.217

TARGETED- WHAT THE SUCCESS RATE

01:53:51.591 --> 01:53:54.561
IS UNLIKE WHY SO WITH THAT

01:53:54.627 --> 01:53:55.195
