GONNA THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING FORTH THIS BILL ACTUALLY DID HAVE A COUPLE OF BRIEF QUESTIONS SO FIRST QUESTION IS IS THAT -- IN TERMS OF PEOPLE QUALIFY THE DEAL DO YOU KNOW IF -- IF THE PARENTS FOR EXAMPLE WERE GIG WORKERS BUT THEY HAVE THEM BUT THEY HAVE HAD -- EST ARE NOT BECAUSE WITH THOSE THEIR CHILDREN THEREFORE ALSO BE ANOTHER GROUP TO PERHAPS WOULD MISS OUT ON THE FEDERAL PROGRAM WOULD NOT WOULD HAVE MISSED OUT SOME NOT IT DEPENDS AND IF THEY HAD WERE SET UP TO BE PAYING INTO THE -- THAT FRONT OKAY SO THE WORDS THEN AGAIN THAT THEIR CHILDREN WOULD NOT AND OF COURSE IT MAY BE A HIGH RISK SITUATION AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION I HAVE -- OTHER YOU MAY END UP TO ANSWERING IT FINANCES THAT SO THE FUNDS THAT WERE WOULD YOU PUT IN THESE ACCOUNTS -- WOULD THEY BE INVESTED BY THE STATE WHO WHO WOULD MANAGE THE FUNDS UNTIL THE UNTIL THE CHILD BECOMES EIGHTEEN RIGHT SO AND WE'RE WE ALL THOSE ARE TO BE PART OF THE NEGOTIATIONS THAT -- LET'S JUST SAY IF IT'S WITH THE TREASURER'S OFFICE FOR EXAMPLE WE WOULD HOPE THAT THEY WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO GAIN VALUE DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN AT THE DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE POSITIVE DEPENDING ON THE AGE SO IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE OLDER THERE'D NEED TO BE A LITTLE MORE MONEY PUT IN RIGHT NOW AGAIN ASSUMING THIS RIGHT NOW TO GAIN AS MUCH IN VALUE AND IF YOU'RE YOUNGER THAN WOULD HAVE A LONGER TIME NOW OBVIOUSLY EVEN THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS WILL END UP BEING NEGOTIATED BECAUSE BUDGETARY ISSUE AND IF YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S AN APPROACH OR WHETHER IT'S LATER -- BUT WE'VE PUT IN WE'VE BOTH PUT IN A SUGGESTED AMOUNT THAT ONE WOULD WANT TO HAVE DEPOSITED AND WE'VE ALSO PUT IN WHAT WE THOUGHT THE INCOME THRESHOLD SO THIS WHAT ARE YOU DIDN'T THAT IF I IF IT'S A HIGH INCOME INCOME FAMILIES LOST A PAIR IN -- OUR PRIMARY CARE GIVER THEY MAY NOT TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE HEALTH ACCOUNTS OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL LOOK FOR TO -- THE FINAL RESULTS WHEN IT HITS THE FLOOR BUT I APPRECIATE THE ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS AGAIN I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE POINTED OUT IN YOUR INTRODUCTION THAT WE -- TRY TO ORGANIZE A CLOSE BECAUSE YOUR CLOTHES IS THE WEALTH GAP BUT AT LEAST THE LEAST -- GIVE SOME RESOURCES -- TO -- THESE YOUTH SO THAT THEY CAN HOPEFULLY GET -- THAT THEY'RE NOT TO DISADVANTAGED BECAUSE FOR THAT WAY AT THE START AND THEY'RE VERY DISADVANTAGED ODDS TO OFTEN SO WITH THAT
