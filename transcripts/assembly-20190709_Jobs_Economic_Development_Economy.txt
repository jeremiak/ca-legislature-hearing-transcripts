ITEM THREE SB SEVEN THIRTY EIGHT THE MOTION IS TO PASS WITH AMENDMENTS TO ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS CHAIR CERVANTES AYE CHAU CERVANTES ANA PLACER CUNNINGHAM. CHAU CHEN. CHEN HI RAMOS. MOST ON A COOLEY. COOLEY ON A SMITH. SMITH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'LL LEAVE THAT THE ON CALL. WE HAVE THE ITEM NUMBER FOR SENATOR ARCHULETA. SB -- FIVE EIGHT EIGHT GOOD MORNING PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOUR RIGHT -- ARE WE READY YES OKAY GOOD. GOOD MORNING LADIES AND GENTLEMAN. AND ESPECIALLY TO YOU MADAM CHAIR. ENTER YOUR MEMBERS I WILL BE TAKING COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS. I'D LIKE TO TAKE ED THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND STAKEHOLDERS FOR THEIR DILIGENT WORK. ON SB. FIVE EIGHTY EIGHT AS MANY OF YOU KNOW AND ARE VERY WELL AWARE THE DISABLED VETERAN BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED TO SUPPORT DISABLED VETERANS SEEKING. TO SEEKING REHABILITATION AND TRAINING THROUGH. THEIR PARTICIPAION AND BY LEVERAGING THE STATE'S MULTI BILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL CONTRACTS. SO THE VETERAN CAN PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND NINETEEN FOLLOWING AUDITS OF THE PROGRAM THE STATE ORDER. REPORTED THAT MANY CONTRACTS AWARDING DEPARTMENTS ARE DOING A DISSERVICE TO VETERANS IN ACQUIRING AND MAINTAINING CERTIFICATIONS -- TO VETERANS WHO ARE CALLED SUBCONTRACTOR AND PAYMENTS MADE TO THEM. DISABLED VETERAN CONTRACTORS HAVE BEEN MY OFFICE THAT THEY ARE BEING MIS USE MISREPRESENTED. AND UNDER PAID IT IN SOME CASES THAT THEY'RE EVEN LISTED ON DISABLED VETERAN BUSINESS BIDS. BY PRIME CONTRACTORS WITHOUT BEING PROPERLY NOTIFIED OF THEIR PARTICIPATION AND RESPONSIBILITY IN THE BED ULTIMATELY THE CONTRACT. FURTHERMORE THEIR NAMES ARE BEING USED TIME AND TIME AGAIN IN DIFFERENT BIDS FOR DISABLED VETERAN BUSINESS CONTRACT WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT. AND WE MUST FIND THIS APPALLING WELL EXISTING LAW PROVIDES SERIOUS PENALTIES FOR PRIME CONTRACTORS WHO KNOWINGLY PROVIDE FALSE INFORMATION TO AN AWARDING DEPARTMENT REGARDING THIS PAYMENTS TO SUBCONTRACTORS. THERE IS NO CORRESPONDING PENALTY FOR PRIME CONTRACTORS SIMPLY FAILING TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION AT ALL. WE MUST PROVIDE THE MEANS THE CLOSEST THAT A LOOPHOLE SO WE CAN ANALYZE THE PROGRAM PROPERLY. SB FIVE EIGHTY EIGHT WILL PROTECT DISABLED VETERANS -- WITH THE FOLLOWING ENFORCEMENT TOOLS. EXPAND THE ELEMENTS OF THE PREVIOUSLY MANDATED CERTIFICATION BY THE PRIME CONTRACTORS TO INCLUDE. THE FOLLOWING THE PROJECT NAME ASSOCIATED WITH EACH DISABLED VETERAN BUSINESS AND SUB CONTRACTOR AND THAT ALL PAYMENTS SPECIFIED IN THE SUB CONTRACT. HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE DISABLED VETERAN BUSINESS. WHEN A PRIME CONTRACTOR FAILS TO REPORT A SUBCONTRACTOR PAYMENTS THERE WARDING DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO NOTIFY THE CONTRACTOR FIRM AND GIVE THE RESPONSIBLE TIME? AND BE GIVEN RESPONSIBLE TIME TO REPORT THE DATA. FOR THE CONTRACTOR THAT FAILS TO RESPOND WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME A TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS CIVIL PENALTY IS SET FOR A FIRST VIOLATION. FOR SUBSEQUENT VIOLATIONS AND ADDITIONAL PENALTIES INCREASED BY TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH TIME. FOR EXAMPLE THE SECOND FENCE WOULD BE TWENTY THOUSAND AND THE NEXT THIRTY THOUSAND AND SO ON BECAUSE REMEMBER THESE ARE LARGE LARGE CORPORATIONS WITH BILLION DOLLAR MILLION DOLLAR CONTRACTS. SO THE SMALL VETERAN THE SUBCONTRACTOR IS THE ONE WHO'S TRULY AFFECTED. THIS REMEDIAL PROCESS AN APPLICATION OF CIVIL PENALTY SUNSET -- WILL SUNSET ON JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY FIVE REQUIRED THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S TO ANNA AND BEFORE JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE COMPLETA COPPER TO HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE AND ASSESSMENT OF THE PROGRAM. SO YES IT'S SET SETS AND TWENTY FIVE BUT IT TWENTY THREE WILL TAKE A GOOD HARD LOOK. AT WERE WHAT PROGRESS WE'VE MADE. THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WILL ALSO REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES TO CONTRACT THE ANTI CONTACTED DISABLED VETERAN BUSINESS ENTERPRISE WHEN A PRIME CONTRACTOR REQUEST TO SUBSTITUTE THE VETERAN SUBCONTRACTOR IN THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT. SO WHEN THESE VETERANS HAVE THESE ARE NAMED AS A SUBCONTRACTOR AND THERE REMOVED THEIR TO BE PROPERLY NOTIFIED OF THE REMOVAL AND WHY. THE SB. FIVE EIGHTY EIGHT IS SUPPORTED BY SEVERAL VETERANS ORGANIZATIONS AND THE PROGRAM ITSELF. IN A HAD RECEIVED UNANIMOUS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.

JOYCE ON BEHALF OF ENDEAVOR ALSO IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING ROBERT MITCHUM TO HAVE THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEE NINE NOW I I DO WANT TO BRING IT BACK TO THE AUTHOR AND ASKED WILL YOU BE ACCEPTING TODAY'S -- PROPOSED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WONDERFUL WONDERFUL THANK YOU -- I DO WITH THAT. I DO WANT TO I JUST SAY THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH -- OUR STAFF -- ON THIS BILL I KNOW THAT WE WORKED ON A LOT OF AMENDMENTS THAT OVER THE COURSE OF YESTERDAY AND I WILL SAY. I AM PREPARED TO SUPPORT THIS BILL I DO HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS BEFORE WE DO MOTION I AND FEEL FREE ARE FOR THOSE A TESTIFIED IN SUPPORT TO ANSWER AS WELL. I NOTICED THAT WITHIN THE BILL LANGUAGE THERE'S NO WILL PRIORITIES PRIORITIES IDENTIFIED WHEN IT COMES TO RATING OR RANKING -- CRITERIA FOR THE REVIEW OF ANY APPLICATIONS WHAT ARE YOU ENVISIONING AS A PROGRAMS PRIORITIES -- AND EVALUATION CRITERIA. OF THE THE MAIN THING IS THAT NEEDS TO BE A NEW EVENT -- THAT'S COMING OR IT NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE -- SIGNIFICANT AKRON INCREMENTAL VALUE SO EVEN IF IT IS A AN EVENT THAT IS PERHAPS BàN. IN A SMALLER CITY COULD BE GILROY. GARLIC VESSEL JUST USING AS AN EXAMPLE IF THEY WANT TO INCREASE IT SO THAT IT IS GOING TO BE AGAIN GENERATE SIGNIFICANT -- TRUCK NEW BUSINESS FROM OUT OF STATE INTO STATE -- THAT WOULD HELP QUALIFY IT IT CERTAINLY CAN BE A MAJOR EVENT THAT IS GOT PROVEN ECONOMIC IMPACT THERE WILL NEED TO BE A STUDY DONE AHEAD OF TIME OR PROJECTION OF FORECAST. OF WHAT THAT ECONOMIC BENEFIT WOULD BE AND THEN AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE EVENT OBVIOUSLY THERE WOULD BE A POST -- SERVICE THIS STUDY DONE AS WELL. THANK YOU AND ARE JUST AN ADDITIONAL QUESTION HOW DO YOU SEE THIS PROGRAM ONLY SKILLED FOR A LARGE EVENTS -- SUCH AS THE NC DOUBLE A CHAMPIONSHIP OR DO YOU SEE A FOR SMALLER COMMUNITIES WHERE YOU'RE ABLE TO HAVE A REGIONAL EVENT -- SUCH AS A FALL HARVEST FESTIVAL HOW WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THAT LOOK LIKE SO MY VISION IS THAT THIS WOULD BENEFIT OF ALL COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA BUT IN PARTICULAR SMALLER COMMUNITIES SO -- CALIFORNIA IS A LOT OF NATURAL ADVANTAGES WHEN WE'RE COMPETING FOR THINGS LIKE CONVENTIONS OR EVEN CULTURAL EVENTS LIKE SHAKESPEARE FESTIVAL. BUT IF THE COMMUNITY FOR EXAMPLE HERE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WANTED TO COMPETE WITH THE STATE OF OREGON FOR THE SHAKESPEARE FESTIVAL WHICH WOULD BE A NEW ENTERPRISE -- IN A SMALLER COMMUNITY COULD HAVE BEEN A GREATER. IMPACT AT LEAST -- PROPORTIONATELY TO SMALLER COMMUNITIES SO MY VISION IS THAT THIS WOULD BE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR SMALLER COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR THIS MEASURE I HAPPEN TO REPRESENT A COUPLE OF COMMUNITIES ONE THAT HAS MOVED FROM WHAT WOULD WOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED A SMALL COMMUNITY TO A NICE MID SIZE CITY NOW. AND IT WAS EXACTLY BECAUSE OF OPPORTUNITIES -- LIKE THIS FOR INSTANCE THEY HOST ANNUALLY A LEG OF THE ENGINE TO WORK -- AND IT HAS BROUGHT A LOT OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY TO THE REGION AS WELL AS KIND OF YOU KNOW RAISE THE PROFILE ON THE MAP. BUT IF YOU THE COMMUNITIES I REPRESENT STILL ARE THOSE SMALL SIZED TOWNS AND THEY'RE LOOKING TO HOST THINGS THAT RAISE THEIR PROFILE AS WELL BRING SOME RENEWED CULTURAL OR SPORTS ACTIVITYTO THE COMMUNITY AND SO I THINK THIS IS A TREMENDOUS IDEA REALLY APPRECIATE IT. AND MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU THAT THAT IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF EVENT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE A BICYCLE RACE FOR EXAMPLE CAN BE HELD VIRTUALLY ANY PLACE IN THE COUNTRY. AND SO IF IF WE COMPETE HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE ATTRACT THAT BICYCLE RACE HAVE BEEN NEWS AND THEN IT IT'S GOING -- TO INCREASE THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN AND WHATEVER COMMUNITY WHEREVER IT'S LOCATED IN IT'S IT'S GOING. TO PUT THAT COMMUNITY ON THE MAP IN SOME RESPECTS AS WELL. I MUST SAY I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME CONVERSATION WITH -- GO BIZ AND DIE I WANTED JUST TO ASK YOU WILL. THERE BE MORE THAN ONE APPLICATION BE CONSIDERED FOR THE SAME EVENTS ARE IF SO HOW WOULD GO OF IT GOBIZ EVALUATES -- THE APPLICATION TO CHOOSE A WINNER COULD THERE BE. JUST. I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S MAYBE A RESPONSE TO THAT OR NOT YEAH IS IT AN ONGOING CONVERSATION YOU HAVE WITH GO BIZ AT THIS. POINT IN TIME -- ALAN JO JUMP IN BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WILL IT THE THE THAT WILL ALREADY NEED TO BE AWARDED -- PRIOR TO THE THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE AN ONGOING CONVERSATION ABOUT TO DEVELOP WHAT THE CRITERIA ARE TO DEAL WITH. COMPETITIVE ARE COMPETING -- APPLICANTS FOR THE SAME OFFENSE I MEAN IDEALLY -- YOU KNOW THE STATE WOULD GET BEHIND ONE APPLICANTS SO IT WOULD HAVE TO EVALUATE THOSE COMPETING APPLICATIONS. TO START. I CAN ONLY SPEAK TO MY OWN VISION MY OWN VISION WOULD BE IF FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE LARGEST CITIES IN CALIFORNIA WERE COMPETING FOR THE SAME EVENT WITH. FOR EXAMPLE A SMALLER LOCATION IT WOULD BE MY PERSONAL POINT OF VIEW -- THIS IS NOT THE WORK OUT MY PERSONAL POINT OF VIEW IS THAT THE ECONOMIC IMPACT THE PROPORTIONATE ECONOMIC IMPACT IN THE SMALLER COMMUNITY.
