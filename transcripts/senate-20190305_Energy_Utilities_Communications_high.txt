CONCERNING THE PREVIOUS BANKRUPTCY CASE IN. TWO THOUSAND ONE AND WHAT IS THE RELEVANCE IN THIS CASE -- IF ANY [inaudible] GRANTED -- OR I'LL BE AT THE CONCERT -- CIRCUMSTANCES LEADING UP TO THE A BANKRUPTCY FILING ARE ARE VERY DIFFERENT. BUT OTHER MAY BE -- SOME HELPFUL TAKEAWAYS FROM THE TWO THOUSAND ONE BANKRUPTCY IN TERMS OF HOW IT WAS DEALT AND HOW THIS ONE COULD BE DEALT. A AND AND IF IF WE CAN BETTER INFORM OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THESE ISSUES. IN TERMS OF HOW WE CAN ADDRESS THIS. ARE THE FINAL PANEL OF THE HEARING A INCLUDE SIX WITNESSES TO SPEAK TO THE POTENIAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE P. JEANNIE BANKRUPTCY FILING FOR WILD FIRE VICTIMS -- THAT INCLUDES RATEPAYERS UTILITY WORK FORCE AND OTHERS. AND I YOU KNOW I WANT TO BE CLEAR IN IN IN THIS THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES ARE WE PRESUMING. THESE SIX WITNESSES REPRESENT ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS WHO MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE BANKRUPTCY. BUT RATHER THEY ARE SIMPLY -- pSLICE OF THE PIE. A REPRESENTING ALL OF OF OF THE MS -- IN IN A IN A VERY SMALL WAY -- INDEED DID THE A TENT. THE INTENT IN THIS IS. PROVIDE MANNER MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. AND THE PUBLIC A GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF THE WIDE RANGING ISSUES. THAT ARE OF CONCERN AND HOW THEY MAY AFFECT PEOPLE AND ARE AFFECTING PEOPLE CURRENTLY. A NOTICEABLY NOT INCLUDED TODAY'S AGENDA OF COURSE IS A REPRESENT AND REPRESENTATIVES FROM BG ANY. THERE MAY BE A MORE APPROPRIATE TIME IN THE FUTURE -- TO DISCUSS. THIS BANKRUPTCY WITH MEMBERS OF P. GINNY BUT THE THE OBJECTIVES TODAY IS -- TO GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROCESS. OF THIS PARTICULAR BANKRUPTCY CASE. AS WELL AS TO HELP SERVICE SOME OF THE IMPLICATIONS TO CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIANS. THE COMMITTEE DOES NOT INTEND TO HAVE TODAY'S HEARING RESOLVE THE ISSUES WITHIN THE BY A BANKRUPTCY PROCESS OR OR TO BE. THE VENUE BY WHICH WITNESSES LITIGATE THEIR CLAIMS OR REYES. THEIR CLAIMS. WITH THIS IN MIND THE COMMITTEE HAS CHOSEN TO FOCUS -- COMMENTS FROM OTHER KEY STAKEHOLDERS. IN THIS PROCESS AT THIS TIME. LASTLY I ALSO WANT TO PROVIDE A CAUTION THAT WE ARE ALL VERY MINDFUL TO THE ATTENTION OF THE CAPITAL MARKETS TO ANY ACTION THAT WE TAKE. ON THESE RELATED ISSUES ANYTHING WE SAY. WHETHER IT'S TRUE OR NOT CAN HAVE. A CAN BE POTENTIALLY TO ON OUR UTILITIES AND THIR ABILITY TO SERVE THE PROP PUBLIC. I WOULD LIKE -- TO YOU KNOW UNDERSCORE THIS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THAT THIS IS AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING. THIS IS ENTERED INTENDED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC. AND TO OUR THE THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE WE WILL NOT BE VOTING ON ANY PROPOSALS TODAY OR TAKING ACTION NOR IS THIS -- A A A GONNA LEAD TO ACTION IN PARTICULAR. A WILL IN TERMS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE I WANT TO MAKE THAT VERY CLEAR BECAUSE OF COURSE. MANY PEOPLE THEY ME LISTENING TO AND WE HOPE THE WRONG MESSAGE IS NOT TRANSMITTED. SO LOOKING FORWARD TO THIRTY SIX DISCUSSION WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN. WITH OUR FIRST SPEAKER TODAY. AND I'D LIKE TO AND I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY -- INVITING IN -- JERRY LAI S. THE ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF LAW AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW GOOD MORNING. WELCOME DON'T BE AFRAID WE DON'T BITE HARD -- SO -- SHERMAN WHO HUESO IN HONOR OF MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TODAY TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT CHAPTER ELEVEN BANKRUPTCY -- BY WAY OF BACKGROUND I AM AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF LAW AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HASTINGS COLLEGE OF THE LAWN SAN FRANCISCO IN MY RESEARCH AND TEACHING FOCUSES ON BANKRUPTCY LOSS OF THIS IS VERY MUCH A SITUATION THAT. IS RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE OF WHAT I TEACH IN RESEARCH ABOUT -- I WAS ASKED TODAY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH SOME BACKGROUND IN CHAPTER -- ELEVEN AS YOU CONSIDER YOUR REGULATORY SPONSOR ABILITIES IN OPTIONS WHEN IT COMES TO P. JEANNIE. THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF CONFUSION IN THE PRESS AND EVEN AMONG MANY LAWYERS WHO DON'T SPECIALIZE IN BANKRUPTCY ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT CHAPTER ELEVEN BANKRUPTCY IS -- WHAT IT CAN DO FOR DISTRESSED COMPANY HELP CLEAR UP SOME OF THAT CONFUSION FOR YOU AND PROVIDE YOU WITH A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND THE WILL HELP INFORM THE CHOICES? THAT LINE FRONT OF YOU -- IN WHAT IS SHAPING UP TO BE ONE OF THE MOST COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT CHAPTER ELEVEN CASES OF ALL TIME. ON IN GENERAL BANKRUPTCY LAW CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS SOLVING THE PROBLEMS THE FINANCIAL DISTRESS CREATES IMAGINE THE SOMEBODY WERE TO BORROW A HUNDRED DOLLARS FROM A BANK TO START A STORE -- TO BE SENT TO THE STORE DOESN'T WORK YOU KNOW WE THEN HAVE A SERIES OF POLICY CHOICES ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY DO WE DO WITH THIS PERSON SHOULD THIS PERSON BE FORCED TO WORK FOR THE REST OF THEIR IFE TO TRY TO MAKE THAT HUNDRED DOLLARS SO THEY CAN PAY. BACK THE BANK ON IT SHOULD THE LOS SOMEHOW GIVE THIS PERSON A FRESH START -- SO LONG AS THERE ARE SOME BASELINE PROTECTIONS FOR CREDITORS ON THE POLICY CHOICE THE FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY LÃ  MAKES IS THAT IF YOU MAKE TOO MANY PROMISES THAT YOU CAN'T KEEP. YOU CAN FILE FOR CHAPTER ELEVEN BANKRUPTCY RELIEF FOR OTHER FORMS OF BANKRUPTCY RELIEF -- AND GET A CHANCE TO START OVER GO ON WITH YOUR LIFE AND CREDITORS ARE ENTITLED TO SOME BASELINE -- TREATMENTS THAT IS PROVIDED BY THE BANKRUPTCY CODE THIS IS WHY OFTEN TEACH MY STUDENTS THE BANKRUPTCY LAW IS THE LAW OF BREAKING -- PROMISES -- PROMISES THAT YOU MAKE THE CREDITORS AS WELL AS PROMISES THAT YOU IMPLICITLY MAKE TO PEOPLE WHO FOR EXAMPLE COME ON ENTITLED TO BE MADE WHOLE IF THEY WERE TO TRIP AND FALL OR TO SUSTAIN SOME OTHER DAMAGES -- AND OBVIOUSLY PROMISES THAT YOU MAKE TO GOVERNMENTS GOVERNMENTAL REGULATORS IAN'S TWO QUARTS -- IMPORTANTLY BANKRUPTCY LAW PROVIDES FOR TWO KINDS OF TREATMENTS FOR DISTRESSED COMPANIES ON THE FIRST IS THE MOST FAMOUS ONE YOU HEAR MENTIONED IN THE PRESS A LOT CHAPTER. ELEVEN I'M CHAPTER ELEVEN IS A STATUTES OF BANKRUPTCY LAW. AT A HIGH LEVEL WHEN A FIRM FILED FOR CHAPTER -- ELEVEN THEY HAVE AN OPERATING BUSINESS THAT IS GENERALLY A GOOD BUSINESS THAT IS PRODUCING PROFIT PERHAPS TOO LITTLE PROFIT TO PAY FOR THE DEBTS ON THAT THEY BORROWED IN THE PAST. ON TO CHAPTER ELEVEN PROVIDES A FIRM LIKE SOME OF THE DEATHS THAT THEY BORROWED -- INTO PROTECT CREDITORS WHILE THE SAME TIME GETTING RID OF UNDER PERFORMING ASSETS AND I'M SHUTTING BAD CONTRACTS. IN SOME CASES FIRMS COULD INSTEAD APPLY FOR WHAT WE CALL A CHAPTER SEVEN LIQUIDATION IN A CHAPTER SEVEN A FIRM IS GENERALLY THROWING UP HIS HANDS AND SAYING WE CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE WHATEVER ASSETS WE HAVE IN A PROFITABLE WAY. WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE THE EQUIVALENT OF A GARAGE SALE THAT'S NOT WHAT P. GENIES AT P. JEANNIE FILED FOR CHAPTER ELEVEN BANKRUPTCY ON IN GENERAL BANKRUPTCY LAW HAS BECOME SO SOPHISTICATED IN BANKRUPTCY PROFESSIONAL SO SOPHISTICATED -- THAT FOR THE MOST PART ON CONSUMERS AND CREDITORS OF P. JEANNIE WHO DO BUSINESS WITH P. JEANNIE AS PART OF THEIR DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS WON'T EVEN NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE -- NEXT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO SUMMARIZE Y. P. GENIE IS BETTER OFF BECAUSE THEY FOUND FOR BANKRUPTCY. FIRST P. JEANNIE HAS ABOUT TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS IN BANK THAT AND MOST THE BOND ACT WELL THIS SOUNDS LIKE A LOT IT ACTUALLY ISN'T IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF P. JEANNIE BECAUSE P. GENIE IS SO MASSIVE. AND CREATES SO MUCH REVENUE ON THIS MEANS P. JEANNIE HAS A VERY DIFFERENT PROFILE THAN YOUR AVERAGE CHAPTER ELEVEN CORPORATE DEBTOR WHEN GENERAL MOTORS FOR EXAMPLE FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY THEY FILED BECAUSE THEY HAD CARS THE PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT TO BUY IN NEEDED TO FIX THAT -- P. GENIES CORE PRODUCT YOU KNOW IT HAS DEMANDED CUSTOMERS WHO NEED ELECTRICITY IN CALIFORNIA ON P. JEANNIE FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY INSTEAD BECAUSE OF THE MASSIVE AMOUNT OF LIABILITY ASSOCIATE WITH THE VARIOUS WILD FIRES THAT IT HAS BEEN FOUND LIABLE FOR MAY BE LIABLE. FOR ESPECIALLY THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WILDFIRES ON P. JEANNIE CFO TESTIFIED ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE BANKRUPTCY CASE THAT THEY FACE MORE THAN FIFTY SIX HUNDRED PLAINTIFFS WHO FILED MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY LAWSUITS. RELATED TO THOSE TWO CASES THISLITIGATION IS INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED IN A CERTAIN TO DRAW IN VARIOUS INSURERS -- IN A WHILE IS OTHER GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES -- THE BENEFIT TO P. GENIE IS THAT BANKRUPTCY LAW PROVIDES FOR AN AUTOMATIC STAY OF THIS LITIGATION THE AUTOMATIC STAY OF LITIGATION MEANS THAT ALL OF THESE COURT CASES INVOLVING P. JEANNIE WHICH IS AGAIN. MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY LAWSUIT THE COURT -- WHERE THERE IS A CLAIMS PROCESS CREATED BY FEDERAL LAW SO OUTSIDE OF BANKRUPTCY -- IF YOU WANTS TO SUE P. JEANNIE YOU GO TO YOUR STATE COURT TO FILE A LAWSUIT AND THEN THERE'S LITIGATION YOU COULD SEE JERRY YOU COULD SEE A JUDGE INSIDE BANKRUPTCY THE PROCESS IS VERY DIFFERENT. YOU FILE A CLAIM -- THROUGH THE BANKRUPTCY COURTS CLAIMS PROCESS -- THERE MAY BE AN ESTIMATION HEARING TO THE EXTENT THAT -- P. JEANNIE WERE TO CONTEST THE CLAIM -- AND WHAT COULD TAKE WEEKS OUTSIDE OF BANKRUPTCY I GET MORE PERHAPS EVEN MONTHS IN A STATE COURT I'M CAN BE DEALT WITH BY THE BANKRUPTCY JUDGE IN AN HOUR -- THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY BANKRUPTCY LAW IS OFTEN A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF DEBTORS WHO HAVE LOTS OF TORT CLAIMS OUT THERE THEY'RE BEING SUED BY LOTS F PEOPLE THEY GET A MORE EFFICIENT ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE -- THE SECOND BENEFIT OF CHAPTER ELEVEN FOR P. GENIE IS THE ABILITY TO GET NEW FINANCING -- AS THE CHAIRMAN MENTIONED IN HIS INTRODUCTORY REMARKS THE ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS IS KEY FOR AN ENERGY COMPANY -- GIVEN P. GENIES LIABILITY SITUATION WHERE THEY HAVE SEEM TO HAVE ALL OF THIS UNKNOWN ON ESTIMATED ON LIQUIDATED TORT LIABILITY ON IN MAY HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT FOR PEACE YOU NEED TO BORROW ADDITIONAL MONEY. OUTSIDE OF BANKRUPTCY ON A FAVORABLE GIVE NEW IN THE FORMAL WE CALL A DEBTOR IN POSSESSION LOAN ON A SUPER SENIOR CLAIM SO A GROUP OF BANKS WHICH IS CURRENTLY NOW PROMISING TO LAND A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY TO P. JEANNIE -- CAN REST ASSURED THAT THEY'LL BE PAID IN FULL ONCE THE BANKRUPTCY JUDGE APPROVED THE BORROWING WHICH IS ALREADY BEEN APPROVED -- BY THE CPUC. SO THERE COUPLE OF NOTEWORTHY THINGS ABOUT THE FIVE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR DIP LOAN THAT I THOUGHT ARE WORTH EMPHASIZING BECAUSE THEY POINT TO WHERE THIS BANKRUPTCY PROCESS IS GOING ON FIRST. THE SHEER SIZE OF THIS OUT OF THE LOAN THE BANKS ARE WILLING TO GIVE THE P. JEANNIE FIVE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IS UNUSUAL THIS IS AN UNUSUALLY LARGE DIP LOAN -- AND WITH THIS REFLECTS I THINK IS THE INVESTOR COMMUNITIES CONFIDENCE ON THE P. JEANNIE HAS A BRIGHT FUTURE ONCE THEY FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO -- WITH THE LIABILITY SITUATION THEY HAD IN THE PAST AS WELL AS THE LIABILITY SITUATION THEY HAVE GOING FORWARD -- ALSO BECAUSE IT'S A LOT OF MONEY ON IT REFLECTS THE INVESTOR COMMUNITIES VIEW PERHAPS THE P. JEANNIE MIGHT BE IN BANKRUPTCY FOR QUITE A WHILE. ON THE DIPLOMA ISN'T TO DO THAT THAT ONE IS THAT IS BEING LUNCH THE P. JEANNIE UNTIL DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY I'M P. JEANNIE HAS THE OPTION TO EXTEND IT FOR A THIRD YEAR IF THEY WANTED TO DECEMBER THIRTIETH. TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT'S A VERY LONG TIME IN THE BANKRUPTCY WORLD -- THE MEDIAN PUBLIC COMPANY TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY BETWEEN AND I'M SERVICE TWENTY ON ITS DUE DECEMBER THIRTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND CAN BE EXTENDED THE TWENTY TWENTY TAIL. ON THAT THE MEDIAN PUBLIC COMPANY TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY BETWEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN NEEDED ABOUT FIVE MONTHS TO REORGANIZE IN THE FACT THAT THE INVESTOR COMMUNITY IS THINKING A MULTI YEAR BANKRUPTCY PROCESS. POINTS TO HOW COMPLICATED THE REASON WHY P. JEANNIE CAN BENEFIT FROM BANKRUPTCY IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET OUT OF UNPROFITABLE CONTRACTS AND TO SHED UNDERPERFORMING ASSETS I'M A DEBTOR CHAPTER ELEVEN HAS THE POWER TO TEAR UP CONTRACTS WHEN IT MAKES BUSINESS SENSE TO DO SO. ON THE COUNTER PARTY THAT TO THAT CONTRACT MIGHT OBJECT IN BE UPSET -- BUT OUT -- BUT IN MOST CASES THEIR ONLY ENTITLED TO A CLAIM FOR DAMAGES AND THE CLAIM FOR DAMAGES MIGHT NOT END UP WORTH VERY MUCH THERE ARE CERTAIN COMPLICATIONS HERE BECAUSE P. GENIE IS PARTY. TO THESE POWER PURCHASING AGREEMENTS THAT HAVE THIS FEDERAL REGULATORY OVERLAY -- IN THEIR LOT OF ON QUESTION ON ON ANSWER QUESTIONS OF LOS SURROUNDING THAT SO P. JEANNIE MIGHT HAVE LESS AUTONOMY TO TERRA BAD CONTRACTS THAN MOST COMPANIES STILL ON BUT IN GENERAL THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY COMPANIES FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY -- FINALLY MANY COMPANIES USE CHAPTER ELEVEN TO IMPROVE THEIR GOVERNANCE P. JEANNIE SEEMS TO BE NO EXCEPTION WITH P. JEANNIE INDICATING THAT HALF THE BOARD WILL BE REPLACED. VERY SOON AND DIFFERENT INVESTORS NOW ADVOCATING TO PUT THEIR OWN DIRECTORS ON THE BOARD AND THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY I THINK FOR P. JEANNIE TO LOOK LIKE A DIFFERENT COMPANY IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE -- BE BEFORE I SPEAK TO SAID BUCKLEY ON HOW THE P. JEANNIE BANKRUPTCY PROCESS IS LIKELY TO PLAY OUT I WANTED TO POINT OUT A COUPLE OF BASIC THINGS ABOUT HOW BANKRUPTCY LAW WORKS -- FIRST A CREDITOR IN BANKRUPTCY HAS A CLAIM THAT A SUBJECT TO WHAT WE CALL DISCHARGE THIS MEANS THAT THE CREDITORS CLAIM WILL BE CANCELED AT THE END OF THE BANKRUPTCY PROCESS. THE LAW PROVIDES THAT THE CREDITORS WILL RECEIVE THE SHARE OF THE DEBTOR'S ASSETS THAT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO TO THE EXTENT THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH ASSETS TO SATISFY CREDITORS -- CREDITORS CAN BE FORCED TO ACCEPT A PARTIAL PAYMENT THAT DOES NOT PAY THEM IN FULL -- SECOND TO HEAR FOR THE MOST PART WILD FIRE VICTIMS AND BOND HOLDERS ARE IN THE SAME BOAT THEY HAVE CLAIMS TO HAVE EQUAL PRIORITY UNDER BANKRUPTCY LAW -- THIS CREATES INCENTIVES FOR QUALIFY ESTIMATE AT A LOWER NUMBER THE VARIOUS CLAIMS THAT ARE STARTED BY THE WILD FIRE VICTIMS THAT WILL BE ONE OF THE MAIN ELEMENTS OF THIS BANKRUPTCY CASE TENSION BETWEEN. DIFFERENT GROUPS OF UNSECURED CREDITORS -- AND I EXPECT P. JEANNIE SHAREHOLDERS MIGHT ALSO GET INVOLVED TO TRY TO DO WHAT THEY CAN TO REDUCE THE P. GENIES ASSERTED WILDFIRE LIABILITY. THIRD BANKRUPTCY LAW DRAWS A DISTINCTION BETWEEN P. PRE BANKRUPTCY CREDITORS AND THOSE WHO HAVE CLAIMS THAT ARISE AFTER A BANKRUPTCY PETITION IS FILED. FOR EXAMPLE A WILDFIRE VICTIM FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN IS A PRE BANKRUPTCY CREDITOR OR A PRE PETITION CREDITOR ON THESE CREDITORS HAVE CLAIMS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO DISCHARGE THEY CAN BE FORCED TO ACCEPT A PARTIAL PAYMENT -- BANKRUPTCY ALSO PROVIDES -- FOR SOMETHING WE CALL ADMINISTRATIVE CLAIMS ADMINISTRATIVE CLAIMS ARISE AFTER THE BANKRUPTCY CASE -- IS FILED SO P. JEANNIE FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY THE END OF JANUARY TWENTY NINETEEN TO THE EXTENT THERE WILD FIRE VICTIMS THIS SUMMER ON THOSE VICTIMS WILL THEN HAVE ADMINISTRATIVE CLAIMS. THE DISTINCTION HERE IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THOSE CLAIMANTS WILL BE ENTITLED TO BE REPAID IN FULL I'M FOR THE FIRM TO THE BANKRUPTCY -- WHAT THIS MEANS -- IS THAT IF THERE ARE LARGE WILDFIRES THIS SUMMER OR LARGE AMOUNTS OF DAMAGE THE CLEAN SUFFERED THIS SUMMER COULD SWAMP WHATEVER ASSETS P. JEANNIE HAS AND THIS SUMMER'S VICTIMS COULD THAT'S AVAILABLE TO SATISFY. THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHILE FIRE VICTIMS AS WELL AS THE BOND HOLDERS ON ADMINISTRATIVE CLAIMANTS ARE ALWAYS PAID A HAD A PRE BANKRUPTCY CREDITORS. ON AS WE CONSIDER WHAT P. ARM AS WE CONSIDER P. GENIES BANKRUPTCY PROCESS IT'S HELPFUL TO CONSIDER WHERE WE CURRENTLY ARE IN THE PROCESS TO SET THE STAGE FOR THE PROCESS IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE IN THE FUTURE. ON AS OF NOW JUDGE MENTALITY HAS GRANTED SOME PRELIMINARY REQUESTED P. JEANNIE TO DO BASIC THINGS LIKE PAY INSURANCE COVERAGE AND PAY WORKERS ON THESE ARE TYPICAL AND NON CONTROVERSIAL HE GENE IS ALSO POISED TO BORROW THE DIPLOMA IN -- AND THEN TO HAVE THE FUNDS OR THE WAR CHEST FOR A LONG BANKRUPTCY CASE ON BANKRUPTCY LAW HAS A LOT OF PROCEDURES AND RULES THAT ARE MEANT TO PROD EVERYONE TO A FULLY NEGOTIATED RESOLUTION. THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF CHAPTER ELEVEN SHE POWER TO FORCE TO DEAL AND CREDITORS IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THE STRONG POLICY PREFERENCE A BANKRUPTCY LAW IS FOR A FULLY CONSENSUAL DEAL THAT EVERYBODY OR ALMOST EVERYBODY SUPPORTS. ON TO LUBRICATE NEGOTIATIONS BANKRUPTCY LAW POINTS WHAT WE CALL OFFICIAL COMMITTEES OF CREDITORS THESE OFFICIAL COMMITTEES OF CREDITORS REPRESENTS SPECIFIC INTEREST IN THE CASE -- THEY'RE ALSO ENTITLED TO HIRE LAWYERS ON AND INVESTMENT BANKERS AND CONSULTANTS WHO MUST BE PAID FOR BY P. JEANNIE. I'M HERE WE HAVE MORE OFFICIAL COMMITTEES OF CREDITORS AND WE USUALLY DO SPEAKING TO THE COMPLEXITY OF HIS BANKRUPTCY CASE THERE'S CURRENTLY AN OFFICIAL COMMITTEE OF UNSECURED CREDITORS -- IN DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE NAME BECAUSE IN THIS CASE THE OFFICIAL COMMITTEE OF UNSECURED CREDITORS IS REALLY LIKE AN OFFICIAL COMMITTEE OF BOND HOLDERS AND COMPANIES THAT DO BUSINESS WITH P. JEANNIE. I'M AS WELL AS SOME REPRESENTATION FROM UNIONS AND PENSION CREDITORS ON THERE'S ALSO NOW A SEPARATE OFFICIAL COMMITTEE OF TORT VICTIMS -- THAT'S MADE UP OF IT OUR LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE TORT CLAIMS I'D IMAGINE CHIEFLY ARISING OUT OF WILD FIRE DAMAGES AGAINST P. JEANNIE -- THEY'RE ALSO LIKELY SEVERAL AD HOC COMMITTEES OF BOND HOLDERS AND SHAREHOLDERS FLOATING AROUND WE SEE SOME OF THEM SHOWING UP IN THE PRESS IN COURTS. ON THEY DON'T HAVE OFFICIAL STATUS MEANING P. JEANNIE WON'T PAY FOR THEIR LAWYERS -- BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN TO BE ACTIVE -- IN THE BANKRUPTCY PROCESS AND TO AGITATE TO NEGOTIATE AND TO TRY TO GET WHAT THEY WANT IN THE FACT THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL COMMITTEES FLOATING AROUND -- AD HOC COMMITTEES SPEAKS TO THE INVESTOR COMMITTEE COMMUNITIES INTEREST IN THIS RESTRUCTURING ON THERE'S EVEN A MOTION THAT IS HIGHLY UNUSUAL I'M FILED BY A VARIETY OF CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL ENTITIES. IMPACTED BY THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN WILDFIRES SUCH AS THE CITY OF NAPA ON MENDOCINO COUNTY AND CINEMA COUNTY AMONG OTHERS SEEKING COURT PERMISSION FOR THEIR OWN OFFICIAL COMMITTEE THIS IS A HIGHLY UNUSUAL. MOTION -- I CAN'T THINK OF VERY MANY PER APPOINT AN OFFICIAL COMMITTEE AND THEN TO FORCE P. JEANNIE TO PAY FOR THEIR LAWYERS -- BUT THAT'S SPEAKS TO THE FACT THAT THEY VIEW THEMSELVES AS HAVING INTEREST THAT AREN'T OTHERWISE REPRESENTED IN THE BANKRUPTCY PROCESS WHICH IS THEY ARE REGULATORY ENTITIES TO PERHAPS HAVE DAMAGES CLAIMS OF THEIR OWN -- BUT THEY ALSO HAVE AN ONGOING INTEREST IN WITH THE POST P. JEANNIE BANKRUPTCY REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ALSO PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE BANKRUPTCY PROCESS THROUGH THE OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES TRUSTEE. THE US TRUSTEE'S OFFICE IS CHARGED WITH ACTING AS A WATCHDOG ON TO MAKE SURE THAT THE POWERS OF CHAPTER ELEVEN ARE NOT ABUSED AND CONGRESSIONAL PUBLIC POLICIES ARE VINDICATED. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE IN PRACTICE WITH THIS MEANS THAT THEY WILL ADD ON EXAMINE THE TYPES OF MOTIONS THAT THE DEBTOR FILES AND THEY WILL CONSULT WITH THE DEBTOR AND PUSH BACK IF FOR EXAMPLE P. JEANNIE WERE TO ASK SOMETHING THAT THEY THOUGHT WAS. OUT OF LINE WITH PUBLIC HOUSE HE CONCERNS -- IMPORTANTLY SOME SORT OF PROCESS WILL BE PUT IN PLACE TO ESTIMATES THE CLAIMS THE WILDFIRE VICTIMS THEIR DIFFERENT WAYS THIS CAN BE DONE IN THE TIMING OF IT COULD VERY IT COULD BE DONE WHILE P. GENIE IS STILL IN BANKRUPTCY -- AND SOME OF THE COULD BE DONE AFTER P. JEANNIE LEAVES BANKRUPTCY ON THE BANKRUPTCY JUDGE IS LIKELY TO BE IN CHARGE OF IT IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE THAT SOME SORT OF TRUST COULD BE CREATED WITH ASSETS. AND SOME SORT OF ADMINISTRATIVE CLAIMS RESOLUTION PROCESS ON INTO THE TERMS AND PROCEDURES THAT GOVERN THE CLAIMS ADMINISTRATION PROCESS AND WHATEVER TRUST IS PUT IN PLACE -- WILL GO A LONG WAY IN DECIDING WHAT KIND OF BARGAINING POWER WILD FIRE VICTIMS AND THAT HAVING IS THE A SIR CLAIMS AND ARE HEARD BY WHATEVER MECHANISM THE COURT CREATES WHICH IS MOST LIKELY GOING TO BE. JUDGE MENTALITY HIMSELF -- THERE'S ALSO A QUESTION OF WHETHER FOR THE FEDERAL ON ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION CAN BLOCK P. JEANNIE FROM TEARING UP POWER PURCHASING AGREEMENTS. ON THIS IS AN UNSETTLED QUESTION OF LAW THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS ASK THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT TO DECIDE IT -- JUDGMENT TALLY JUST SIGNAL BUT HE'D ACTUALLY LIKE TO DECIDED HIMSELF OF POSSIBLE -- THERE'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF AN A JUDICIAL TUG OF WAR THERE THERE WILL BE A DECISION ON AND THERE IS CERTAIN TO BE AN APPEAL BY WHICHEVER SIDE IS LOSING -- I THINK FOR VIEWS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS BASED ON HOW ACTIVELY THEY'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE BANKRUPTCY CASE SO FAR -- I WANT TO UNDERSCORE SOMETHING WHICH IS THIS IS A DEEPLY COMPLICATED BARGAINING ENVIRONMENT -- FORTUNATELY SOME OF THE BEST BANKRUPTCY LAWYERS IN THE COUNTRY ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON IT UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE A LOT OF THEM -- BUT IT WILL STILL BE VERY VERY HARD -- FINALLY JUST A COUPLE OF THOUGHTS ABOUT WHERE ALL OF THIS IS GOING ON IN EXACTLY WHAT THE PROCESS WENT UP LOOKING LIKE P. JEANNIE HAS EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF EXCLUSIVITY WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT. TO PROPOSE A PLAN OF REORGANIZATION THIS AGENDA SETTING POWER PUTS P. GENIES BOARDING MANAGEMENT TEAM IN CONTROL OF THE CASE AND YOU EXPECT THAT THEY'LL TRY TO FINISH. THE BANKRUPTCY PROCESS IN THAT EIGHTEEN MONTHS WITH THAT SAID THE COMPANY HAS YET TO PORT FOR A PUBLIC VISION OF WHAT IT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE WHEN IT LEAVES BANKRUPTCY WHICH IS UNUSUAL AT THIS STAGE. USUALLY COMPANIES WILL HAVE DONE THAT IT SPEAKS TO HOW COMPLICATED THE SAYS -- ENDS THERE ARE A VARIETY OF A VERY COMPLICATED QUESTIONS IN FRONT OF US AND MOST IMPORTANTLY -- HOW WILL P. JEANNIE DEAL WITH FUTURE LIABILITY -- JUDGE MENTALITY CAN ONLY APPROVE A PLAN TO ALLOW P. GENIE OUT OF BANKRUPTCY IF P. JEANNIE CAN ASSERT WHAT WE WOULD CALL. ON A BOAT WITH A FEASIBLE PLAN MEANING JUDGMENT HOLLY LOOKS AT THE PLANETS AS P. GENIES UNLIKELY TO BE BACK IN BANKRUPTCY ANYTIME SOON MAYBE TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW THE STORY WILL BE DIFFERENT BUT JUDGMENT HOLLY WILL BE CONCERNED WITH THE NEXT FIVE YEARS -- THIS MEANS THAT SOMETIME IN THE NEXT EIGHT WILDFIRE NOT ONLY THIS SUMMER -- BUT GOING FORWARD HOW IS IT GOING TO MANAGE THE FACT THAT IT NOW HAS THESE OPERATIONS THAT SEEM TO CREATE RISKS -- THAT RESULT IN LIABILITY -- WILL THERE BE SOME SORT OF RELIEF THAT MAY COME FROM THE STATE LEGISLATURE ON THAT'S A QUESTION THAT I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WONDERING AND WE DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO AN AND ANOTHER QUESTION THAT WE DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO IS. WILL THE LEGISLATURE HAVE TO PROVIDE SOME SORT OF RELIEF FOR PEACE YOU NEED TO HAVE A WAY OUT OF BANKRUPTCY -- AND MY SECOND IN SEC MY SECOND POINT IS THE BANKRUPTCY LAW REQUIRES A REGULATED ENTITY I'M TO HAVE THE APPROVAL OF ITS REGULATOR FOR ANY RATE INCREASE THAT IS PART OF A PLAN OF REORGANIZATION. THIS MEANS THE NOT WITHSTANDING THE AUTOMATIC STAY IN THE POWERS OF BANKRUPTCY LAW ON THE C. P. U. C. WILL HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY I'M IN SHAPING THE PROCESS SINCE THEY WILL NEED TO AUTHORIZE A RATE INCREASE TO THE EXTENT THAT PAGE. P. JEANNIE NEEDS ONE ON IN CONCLUSION YOU SHOULD NOW THINK OF IT P. GENIE IS BEING STOCK IN THIS KIND OF FEDERALLY CREATED BARGAINING ENVIRONMENT WHERE THERE ARE LOTS OF PLAYERS ON ALL SIDES THAT WILL BE ASSERTING THEIR OWN INTERESTS. THERE'S ALSO A FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY JUDGE OVERSEEING THE PROCESS WHO IS THE JOB OF FINDING FACTS MAKING RULES AND PRODDING THE SIDES TO COME TO A NEGOTIATED RESOLUTION. GIVEN THE P. JEANNIE PERHAPS MAY NEED A RATE INCREASE THERE'S DEFINITELY A ROLE FOR THE STATE GOVERNMENT TO PLAY IN SHAPING THE OUTCOME OF THE BANKRUPTCY. I'M IN FACT THE STATE GOVERNMENT MAY NEED TO PLAY A ROLE ON GIVEN THE GIVEN THE FACT THAT P. JEANNIE NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO PROPOSE. A FEASIBLE PLAN OF YOUR ORGANIZATION THE JUDGE MENTALITY BELIEVES WON'T BE FOLLOWED BY A SUBSEQUENT BANKRUPTCY FILING -- THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND I JUST WANTED -- TO MAKE CLEAR. WHAT HAS BEEN YOUR INVOLVEMENT IN THIS? TO WHAT EXTENT HERE ARE THE VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF THIS CASES ARE UNFOLDING [inaudible] OF ACCESSIBLE TO YOU IN TERMS OF YOUR ABILITY TO GET THAT INFORMATION AND ANALYZE IT I'M SURE GREAT QUESTION -- SO MY INVOLVEMENT TO THE IN THIS CASE HAS BEEN FOLLOWING THE COURT DOCKETS BECAUSE ALL OF THESE FILINGS ARE PUBLIC -- I'VE ALSO HAD VARIOUS CONVERSATIONS ALONG THE WAY WITH REPORTERS AND ON MEMBERS OF THE STATE SENATE OR STE STAFF MEMBERS OF THE STATE SENATE -- I'M NOT PRIVY TO ANY CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE NEGOTIATIONS ARE AND I DON'T HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE OF ANY KIND OF LEGISLATION AND THAT IS IN THE WORKS THAT MIGHT PROVIDE FOR SOME SORT OF REGULATORY ANYTHING. COMING OUT OF THIS BANKRUPTCY CASE SO I AM VERY MUCH AN OBSERVER -- AND TO THIS FITS VERY MUCH WITH THE PRACTICE EXPERIENCE THAT I HAD PRIOR TO BECOMING AN ACADEMIC OF WORKING ON LARGE BANKRUPTCY CASES SO THAT'S THE KNOWLEDGE THAT I BRING TO BEAR THANK YOU JUST FOR THE RECORD. I DON'T THINK ANY OF US OR MOST CERTAINLY NOT MYSELF -- OR ARE WE ARE ALSO PRETTY TO CON CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION REGARDING THIS CASE. I ALSO WANT TO ASK -- IN YOUR ANALYSIS HAVE YOU FOUND ANY EVIDENCE ASSISTING SUGGEST THE USE OF P. GINNY IS TRYING TO GET OUT OF POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENTS -- THEY HAVE YET TO SIGNAL THAT THEY WILL -- HOWEVER THEY WOULD IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MALPRACTICE HAD THEY NOT SIGNAL THAT THE BEGINNING THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO RESERVE THE OPTION TO DO SO. ONE OF THE THINGS THE DEBTORS AND CHAPTER LET -- TORY RIGHT TO TERROR CONTRACTS THEY TRY TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN THREATEN TO USE THAT RIGHT IN THE HOPES OF RENEGOTIATING THINGS. EVEN IF THEY DON'T -- THREATENED IF THEY DON'T ACTUALLY. THE CONTRACTS THAT TO MY KNOWLEDGE THEY HAVE NOT. THREATEN TO YOU SO BUT THEY ARE -- IN THE PROCESS AND USING LITIGATION TO ASSERT A PATHWAY THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO DO SO MOST YOU KNOW PERHAPS AND SPECULATING -- TO THEN PROVOKE RE NEGOTIATIONS. AND JUST EXPLAIN WHAT THAT MIGHT MEAN I I GUESS MONTH MOST OF THE MEMBERS OF PROBABLY KNOW BUT IN PREVIOUS YEARS WHEN RATES WERE HIGHER -- UTILITIES ENTERED INTO CONTRACTS LONG TERM CONTRACTS -- AND ON OUR ARE TIED. TO A PROVIDING SUPPLY AT A LARGER RATE SO YOU'RE YOU'RE THINKING THAT -- BY THEM -- DISCLOSING THAT THEY MAKE UP ONE OF GET OUT OF THOSE POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENTS A COURT COULD ACTUALLY GRANT. THEM GETTING OUT OF THAT IF THEY CAN SHOW THAT THEY CAN ENTER INTO ANOTHER GREEN TODAY WITH ANOTHER PROVIDER. OR EVEN WITH THE SAME PROVIDER AT A LOWER RATE WHICH WOULD COST RESULT IN SAVINGS TO THE UTILITY IN PROVIDING THE ENERGY FOR EXAMPLE SO I WANT TO CAST. IT'S A GREAT QUESTION -- I WANT TO QUALIFY MAY ANSWER TO THIS BY SAYING THAT THE LAW IS ON CERTAIN SO BURKE HAS ASSERTED THAT THEY CAN'T DO IT -- IN P. GENIE IS URRENTLY SOFT -- INJUNCTIVE RELIEF THEY'RE LOOKING FOR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT FROM JUDGE MENTALITY THAT NO THEY'RE ALLOWED TO DO IT SO THERE IS THIS LIKE SIDE SHOW -- YOU KNOW THAT ISN'T REALLY CENTRAL TO P. GENIES BANKRUPTCY BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S GOING ON WE'RE P. GENIE IS IN LITIGATION WITH BURKE -- AND WHATEVER HAPPENS IN THAT LED -- TO FOR IS ALSO ASSERTED THAT SOME OF THOSE AGREEMENTS -- HAVE THE FORCE OF LAW EVEN IF YOU TORE UP THE CONTRACT THEIR VARIOUS REGULATIONS THAT WOULD NOT ALLOW PIECE YOU NEED TO GET OUT OF ITS BECAUSE THEY'RE PART OF BROADER. FROM REGULATORY SCHEMES THAT EXIST AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL -- BUT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT P. JEANNIE CAN THE LAW IS UNCERTAIN AND IT WOULD BE REASONABLE TO EXPECT T. G. NEED. TO TEST THE BOUNDARIES OF THAT LAW WHILE THEY'RE IN BANKRUPTCY BECAUSE IT COULD HAVE. A BIG IMPACT IN TERMS OF VALUE TO A TO THE POTENTIALLY. FINANCIALLY IT'S UNCLEAR AYE AYE IT'S UNCLEAR SOME PEOPLE SAY QUITE ENDS BUT IT QUITE OKAY. AND AND YOU MENTIONED THAT THERE'S AN IN THAT THIS BANKRUPTCY. CAN EXTEND EIGHTEEN MONTHS OR IS THAT IS THAT A TERM OF EIGHTEEN MINDS -- IN STATUTE IS THAT AN ESTIMATE -- CAN CAN THIS BE RESOLVED PRIOR TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS OR YOU EXPECTED THIS WOULD TAKE THE FULL EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO RESOLVE THIS BANKRUPTCY. SO IT'S A STATUS SO THERE'S A STATUTORY PERIOD WE'RE PEKINGESE MANAGEMENT TEAM HAS THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO PROPOSE A PLAN OF ORGANIZATION AND THAT'S THAT EIGHTEEN MONTH PERIOD -- AND IN GENERAL IT WOULD BE MALPRACTICE ON THE PART OF P. GENIES LAWYERS IF THEY DIDN'T TRY THEIR HARDEST TO GET OUT OF BANKRUPTCY BEFORE THAT EIGHTEEN MONTHS IS NOT THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF FLEXIBILITY TOWARDS THE END. BUT IN GENERAL YOU CAN THINK OF EIGHTEEN MONTHS TWO YEARS HAS ABOUT THE PERIOD WE'RE P. GENIES MANAGEMENT TEAM WILL CONTROL THE BANKRUPTCY PROCESS ONCE THAT PERIOD LAPSES IT'S NOT THE CASE THE PEKINGESE AND THROWN OUT A BANKRUPTCY. INSTEAD -- OTHER PARTY. GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE BANKRUPTCY AND THE SOPHISTICATION OF P. GENIES CREDITORS AND INVESTORS THAT WOULD CERTAIN. THAT WOULD BE A PROCESS THAT WOULD CERTAINLY BECOME A CIRCUS -- WHERE THEY WOULD BE YOU KNOW MEET TEN FIFTEEN DIFFERENT PLANS ON THE TABLE -- JUDGMENT HOW HE WOULD FIND THAT PROCESS VERY CHALLENGING TO MANAGE AND EVERYONE WILL WORK VERY HARD TO AVOID THAT HAPPENING WE CALL THAT IN BANKRUPTCY SPEAK A COMPETING PLAN PROCESS. TEACHING YOU WILL NEED A PLAN OF ORGANIZATION TO GET OUT OF BANKRUPTCY -- AND YOU HOPE THAT IT HAPPENS WITHIN THAT YOU KNOW TWO YEAR OR SO WINDOW. MONTHS -- WORK I MEAN OF WORKS CONCURRENTLY WITH OUR CALENDAR WE'RE GOING TO BE -- HERE CREATING NEW LAWS OR WORK WORKING ON DIFFERENT THINGS THAT MAY AFFECT P. GINNY EITHER FAVORABLY OR NEGATIVELY -- THROUGH AT LEAST OCTOBER TO SEPTEMBER -- AND THE GOVERNOR WILL HAVE. THE PROCESS OF SIGNING IN BETWEEN BILLS. COULD OUR ACTION HERE. ALL CHURCH CHANGE INFLUENCE WHATEVER'S HAPPENING IN THROUGH THE JUDICIAL BANKRUPTCY PROCESS SO. IF IF WE INTRODUCE A BILL OR PROPOSE -- SOME KIND OF LEGISLATION WOULD THAT ALTER THE DYNAMICS OF THE DISCUSSION IN THE BAT BANKRUPTCY. I'M ABSOLUTELY YOU KNOW SIR PC. WE NEED BECAUSE OF ITS UNIQUE STATUS AS A HYBRID PUBLIC PRIVATE ENTITY -- THE RED IN THE RELATIONSHIP IT HAS WITH ITS REGULATORS AND LAWS THAT A PROPOSED HERE -- COULD VERY MUCH IN -- IMPACT ITS TRAJECTORY GOING I WOULD IMAGINE NOT ONLY THAT YOU KNOW YOU COULD INFLUENCE THE BANKRUPTCY CASE BUT ALSO -- IN HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH INVESTORS THERE'S AN EXPECTATION I THINK THAT THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE WILL LEAD IN PROVIDING A PATH FOR P. GENIE OUT OF BANKRUPTCY THIS AT LEAST WILL MANY PEOPLE SEEM TO THINK. SO GIVEN YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF OF OF BANKRUPTCIES I MEAN USUALLY -- BANKRUPTCIES ARE ARE DEALT WITH. IN IN A IN A CLOSE PROCESS. WITHIN THE JUDICIAL PROCESS BUT GIVEN THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN. CAN INFLUENCE THAT THERE WAS A ACTION. DO YOU KNOW OF A PROCESS OF COMMUNICATING BETWEEN THE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT IN TERMS OF HOW THAT CAN NEGATIVE IT OR ADVERSELY AFFECT THAT I MEAN. BECAUSE THEY'LL BE DIFFERENT PARTIES PROBABLY SEEKING IN. SOME ADVANTAGE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER COME INTO US SAYING CAN YOU DO THIS CAN YOU DO THAT AND THE FACT THIS FOR OUR BENEFIT. AND WE REALLY DON'T HAVE A WAY. TO TWO YOU KNOW -- DISCUSS THAT THAT THE IMPLICATIONS OF OF OUR ACTIONS TO THAT NEGOTIATION PROCESS OF YOU MENTION EVERYTHING YOU'VE DESCRIBED. IN TERMS OF HOW HOW [inaudible] DYNAMIC AND COMPLICATED AND AND YOU KNOW WITH ALL THESE SO MANY PARTIES TO THIS. CLAIM IN PARTICULAR -- BEYOND BONDHOLDERS STOCKHOLDERS -- VICTIMS YOU KNOW THE WHOLE LONG LIST. YOU ALSO HAVE LEGISLATIVE ELEMENT HERE THAT CAN. MAKE THINGS BETTER OR WORSE -- IS THERE. A CONNECTION -- IS THE LEGISLATIVE AND PROP -- ALIMENT I THINK INTRODUCES MUCH MORE UNCERTAINTY IN COMPLEXITY THAT IS IN THE CASE OF ANY OTHER LARGE CORPORATE BANKRUPTCY THAT I'M AWARE OF I THINK THAT THE CHAIRMAN'S -- INSTINCT IS CORRECT AND YOU ARE GOING TO START HEARING AND YOU MAY ALREADY BE HEARING FROM MANY PARTIES TO P. WHO HAVE AN INTEREST IN P. JEANNIE -- WHEN I WAS A LAWYER IN PRIVATE PRACTICE I REPRESENTED CREDITORS IN THE BANKRUPTCY CASE WHERE WE TOOK CONCERNS THAT WE HAD TO FEDERAL REGULATORS ABOUT ASPECTS OF THAT BANKRUPTCY CASE -- YOU CAN IMAGINE YOU WILL HEAR FROM LOTS OF PEOPLE THEY WILL HAVE THEIR OWN PAROCHIAL INTERESTS THEN SOMETIMES THEY MAY HAVE THE PUBLIC INTEREST AT HEART. BUT YES YOU WILL HEAR FROM ALL OF THEM THERE IS NO THIS CREATED BY BANKRUPTCY LAW TO KIND OF MEDIATE. THE INTERACTIONS THAT WALKER BETWEEN I SUPPOSE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF THE STATE ASSEMBLY IN THE STATE SENATE AND YOU KNOW CREDITORS BUT I YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT YOU KNOW PART OF IT WOULD BE MALPRACTICE ON THE PART OF LAWYERS FOR CREDITORS IF THEY DID NOT CONSIDER. THE LARGE ROLE THAT REGULATORY RELIEF MIGHT PLAY IN THIS CASE AND WHETHER THEY WANT TO TRY TO SHAPE THAT. AND GIVEN THAT WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT PARTY OR PRIVY TO THE INTERNAL -- NEGOTIATIONS HAPPENING WITHIN THIS BANKRUPTCY HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE. OUR INVOLVEMENT IN TRYING TO IMPROVE. THE THE THE SITUATION OF THE BANKRUPTCY HOW DO WE GET INFORMATION HOW DO WE PROPOSE A SOLUTION IF WE DON'T KNOW. NECESSARILY WHAT'S HAPPENING INTERNALLY. IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF NOISE ARE. GOING TO HEAR A LOT OF NOISE -- AND BUT I MIGHT HEAR FROM THE LOUDEST VOICE IS NOT NECESSARILY THE THE ONES THAT ARE. REALLY -- THOUGH WOULD THAT NECESSARILY THE ONES THAT NEED TO BE HEARD I THINK THAT'S CORRECT -- SO YOU KNOW YOU YOU WOULD HAVE A NUMBER OF OPTIONS IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO CONSIDER CREATING SOME SORT OF CONSOLIDATED PROCESS -- ONE IS YOU COULD HIRE A BANKRUPTCY LAWYER WHO WILL THEN BE KNOWN AS A PERSON FOR WHO PEOPLE CAN TALK TO AND THAT PERSON CAN ACT AS AN INTERMEDIARY -- FOR THE COMMITTEE AS A WHOLE -- I YOU COULD TRY TO SET UP SOME STORM A FORMAL PROCESS PERHAPS. I DON'T KNOW WITH IT MAKING IT EASY TO COMMENT ON THE INTERNET THAT I'M NOT SURE -- WHETHER THAT'S SOMETHING LIKE THAT IS ALREADY IN PLACE BUT EAT YEAH I THINK I THINK THE CHAIR IS CORRECT IN SUGGESTING THAT YOU'LL WANT TO THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE MAKE SURETHAT YOU'RE NOT JUST HEARING FROM THE WEALTHIEST AND THE LARGEST VOICES. BUT ALSO YOU'RE HEARING FROM EVERYONE CONCERNED WITH P. JEANNIE AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE COMPLEXITY OF THIS INFORMATION ENVIRONMENT WHERE YOU COULD BE HAVING DISCUSSIONS WITH FOR EXAMPLE -- CINEMA COUNTY AND YOU KNOW UNDERSTANDING THEIR CONCERNS ALL THE SAME TIME THERE NEGOTIATIONS GOING ON ELSEWHERE -- A SITUATION THAT I THINK YOU SHOULD BE COGNIZANT OF IS THAT -- YOU KNOW THE PARTIES COULD BUILD A BANKRUPTCY DE ALL AROUND SOME EXPECTED CONTRIBUTION OR LEGISLATION THAT THEY BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO GIVE TEM -- WHICH COULD PUT YOU ON IN A POSITION WHERE YOU MAY HAVE TO DECIDE DO WE WANT TO GIVE THIS TO EVERYONE WHEN YOU KNOW PERHAPS THE BANKRUPTCY JUDGES IN FAVOR OF IT AND ALL THE PARTIES TO THE CASE THAT ARE BIG PARTIES ARE IN FAVOR OF AN A MINIMUM. MENTON FOR THAT COULD BUILD. AND WE MAY BE FAR FROM THAT. YES SENATOR HILL THANK YOU CHAIR THANKS FOR THE GOOD QUESTION LIKE FOR ME I APPRECIATE THAT -- PROFESSOR WELCOME AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR INPUT AND AND I HAVE TWO QUICK QUESTIONS IF I COULD. THE REORGANIZATION PLAN I'M KIND OF OF WHENEVER IT COMES FORWARD -- IF IT'S PRESENTED THAT'S A BY PETE P. JEANNIE UP AND THEN THERE'S THE ISSUE OF WITH IMPAIRED CLASS IF IT AGREES TO SUPPORT THAT REORGANIZATION. THE GENERALLY THAT -- THAT APPROVED THE PLAN AND THAT SEEMS LIKE A VERY LOW THRESHOLD IN THAT COULD YOU EXPLAIN HOW THAT WORKS WE'VE. SURE HAS SO ON THE WAY THE BANKRUPTCY LAW WORKS IS AGAIN THE IDEAL IS A PLAN THAT EVERYBODY SUPPORTS BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT EVERYBODY DOES NOT SUPPORT THE PLAN BANKRUPTCY LAW PROVIDES A ROUTE. FOR A COMPANY TO GET A PLAN APPROVED WITH OUT EVERYONE'S BY AND AND THAT'S PLAN GENERALLY HAS A COP A BUNCH OF REQUIREMENTS -- ONE THAT SENATOR HELL JUST MENTIONED IS THE REQUIREMENT OF AN IMPAIRED ACCEPTING CLASS MEANING THAT SOME GROUP OF CREDITORS WHO WILL. NOT BE MADE WHOLE UNDER THE PLAN -- DECIDE THAT THEY WILLSUPPORT IT AND BANKRUPTCY LAW VIEWS THIS AS A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN A POSITION WHERE THEY HAVE TO TAKE A LOSS IN THERE SAYING WE'RE COMFORTABLE WITH THIS LOSS -- AND THEN THERE'S SOME LEVEL OF MINIMUM TREATMENTS THAT IS REQUIRED BY LAW FOR EVERYONE ELSE ON THE TO THE EXTENT OF THAT DYNAMIC IS THERE THEN THE PLAN WILL BE APPROVED. ON HERE I'M IN ORDER FOR THERE TO BE IMPAIRED ACCEPTING CLASS THAT'S MOST LIKELY GOING TO BE THE CLASS OF GENERAL UNSECURED CREDITORS INCLUDING THE BOND HOLDERS AND THE WILDFIRE VICTIMS -- THEY COULD BE IN THE SAME CLASS THE DEPENDING ON WHAT THE SIZE THE WILDFIRE CLAIMS IS BECAUSE THAT IF THE WILDFIRE CLAIMS ARE LARGE ENOUGH THEY COULD HAVE THE ABILITY. TO BLOCK A YES VOTE FROM THE CLASS OR PERHAPS TO YOU KNOW CONTROL THE VOTE OF THE CLASS ALTOGETHER -- SO THERE ARE SOME SAFEGUARDS BUILT INTO AND IT THE IT'S NOT AS EASY AS IT SOUNDS. I MEAN I THINK THE ROUTES FOR THE DEBTOR TO GET FROM HERE TO THERE WILL BE CHALLENGING THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE CLARIFICATION FINAL QUESTION IS THE ISSUE OF BANKRUPTCY WHEN -- YOU HAVE -- NUMBER OF ASSETS YOUR NUMBER LIABILITIES OBVIOUSLY THE LIABILITY TO SEE THE ASSETS SO THAT EVERYBODY GETS A LITTLE HAIR CUT IN THE PROCESS IS YOU'VE EXPLAINED. BUT LET'S SAY THE AT THE END OF THE REORGANIZATION BOND HOLDERS FIFTY CENTS ON THE DOLLAR VICTIMS GET FIFTY CENTS ON THE DOLLAR IS THERE A A POSSIBILITY IN THAT BANKRUPTCY. TO THEN MAKE THOSE. VICTIMS AS A FIRE VICTIMS IN THIS CASE FULL. OVER A PERIOD OF TIME AFTER AS PART OF THE REORGANIZATION -- AFTER THE BANKRUPTCY AND AFTER THEY COME OUT OF BANKRUPTCY TO THERE COULD BE A PLAN AIMED STRUCTURE GOING FORWARD. THERE COULD BE SO -- THAT WOULD BE A POLICY CHOICE THE P. JEANNIE WANTS TO MAKE SO PEACHY WANTED TO IT IS POSSIBLE TO HAVE A A PLAN WHERE YOU YOU GIVE PEOPLE PERHAPS P. JEANNIE AGREES DOWN THE LINE SO WHICH WOULD GIVE THEM IS. CASH UP FRONT PLUS A PROMISE TO PAY THEM MORE OVER THE FUTURE ON IN THAT COULD BE A PROMISE TO MAKE THEM WHOLE INCLUDING WITH INTEREST IF THEY WANT TO TELL. THAT'S A CHOICE THE P. JEANNIE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE ON IN PRACTICE -- CHOICES LIKE THAT ARE RELATIVELY UNCOMMON CORPORATE BANKRUPTCY BECAUSE IT WOULD CREATE A PROBLEM WILL BE CALLED THAT OVERHANG WE'RE P. JEANNIE WOULD BE SO BUSY IN -- TWENTY TWENTY OUT WE KNOW THEY'RE OUT OF BANKRUPTCY LET'S SAY PAYING FOR THE PAST WILD FIRE VICTIMS THAT MAYBE THEY DON'T HAVE ROOM THAN TO PAY NEW WILDFIRE VICTIMS TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY BECAUSE NEW DAMAGES OR MAYBE THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME CAPACITY TO INVEST IN SAFETY. SO -- IT'S POSSIBLE THEY COULD CHOOSE TO DO THAT BUT I THINK IN ORDER FOR JUDGE MENTALITY TO APPROVE THAT IS A FEASIBLE PLAN THERE WOULD ALSO HAVE TO BE A PATHWAY FOR PEACE YOU NEED TO MAKE INVESTMENTS AND SAFETY -- THAT WE NEED TO AND TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE FUTURE WILDFIRE PROBLEMS AS WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU WILL GO TO CENTER MORE LIKE FULL OF BY SENATOR STONE AND STERN THAN REPEAL [inaudible] THEN HERTZBERG. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- PRESSURED ALLIANCE THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE -- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT FEDERAL JUDGE MOUNT HOLLY THIS IS HIS SECOND. I AM WITH P. GENIES -- COULD YOU MAYBE GIVE US SOME COLOR ABOUT THIS JUDGE. IZZY IS A PREDICTABLE DOES HE HAVE A STYLE -- I THINK SO JUDGE MONTH HOLLY IS SOMEBODY WITH WHOM I AM PERSONALLY ACQUAINTED GIVEN THAT I YOU KNOW TEACH AT A LAW SCHOOL THAT IS A BLOCK FROM HIS COURTHOUSE WE'VE HAD LUNCH BEFORE -- BUT I DON'T KNOW HIM SUPER WELL ON I CAN TELL YOU THAT HE IS HIGHLY REGARDED WITHIN THE BANKRUPTCY COMMUNITY HE MAY BE ONE OF THE BEST KNOWN IF NOT THE BEST KNOWN. BANKRUPTCY JUDGE YOU KNOW WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI UP THAT WOULD GO TOO FAR THERE'S TEXAS -- A BUT HE MAY BE ONE OF THE BEST JUDGES IN THE LAST -- HE'S KNOWN AS BEING SOMEBODY WHO CEREBRAL AND QUITE INTELLIGENT AND THOUGHTFUL -- IT HE DOES HAVE THIS EXPERIENCE WITH THE FIRST P. JEANNIE BANKRUPTCY -- IS SO I I THINK HE HAS A REPUTATION FOR BEING A CAPABLE JURIST AND I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'SANYONE OUT THERE WHO DOUBTS THAT HE IS ABLE TO HANDLE THE MULTITUDE OF COMPLEX ISSUES THAT LINE FRONT OF HIM. SO HE'S FAMILIAR WITH THE BUSINESS MODEL. AND IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE RIGHT FOR YOU SELL A PRODUCT THAT. YOU COULD PAY FOR IT. AND WHAT IS OUR COST OF GOODS SOLD WHAT IS ARE. ARE YOU KNOW BECAUSE FOR OVERHEAD AND INTERESTING SO SO WHAT WHAT WITH HIS EXPERIENCE WILL HE BRING TO SEE OKAY WHAT. WHAT PART OF THIS [inaudible] MUNICIPALITY [inaudible] UTILITY. IN THE T. WHAT WHAT DOES IT HAVE TO STOP. SELLING OR WHAT IS IT HAVE TO IMPROVE ON HE'LL HE'LL HAVE ALL THAT. READY TO GO RIGHT. WELL I THINK YOU SO TWENTY YEARS IS QUITE A WHILE IN PT NEEDS BUSINESS HAS I THINK OF ALL IN THAT PERIOD SO. HE WILL HAVE TO YOU KNOW GET UP TO SPEED I'M SURE THAT HE IS DOING THAT RIGHT NOW -- ALONG WITH HIS LAW CLERKS AND PROBABLY HAS ALREADY GOTTEN THERE AND THE PARTIES TO THE CASE WILL HELP HIM IF YOU LOOK AT THE BANKRUPTCY DOCKET WHAT YOU SEE IS A LOT OF EFFORTS. ON THE PART OF THE COMPANY AND BY CREDITORS TO TRY TO EXPLAIN TO THE JUDGE EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON SO HE HAS THAT PRIOR KNOWLEDGE TO BRING TO BEAR -- AND THEN RIGHT NOW I'M SURE HE IS DELVING BACK INTO THE DETAILS -- SO HE'S READY TO ROLL BUT I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYBODY OUT THERE WHO'S CONCERNS THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE C&lt;c.cyan&gt; MONTHS TO&lt;/c&gt; RAMP UP AND UNDERSTANDING THIS IS THE BUSINESS THESE ARE THE ISSUES. HERE'S WHAT'S GOING TO MATTER BECAUSE HE DOES HAVE EXPERIENCE HAVING PRESIDED AT THE UTILITY -- THE BANKRUPTCY OF A YOU KNOW PUBLIC PRIVATE UTILITY. THE MAYBE WHAT'S NEW IN THE TWENTY YEARS IS RENEWABLES. AND THOSE CONTRACTS AND SO YOU YOU. MENTION THAT HE COULD. CANCEL ALL THOSE CONTRACTS IS THAT CORRECT I'M HE MAY HAVE THE POWER TO DO SO AGAIN IT'S UNCLEAR AS A MATTER OF LAW WHETHER HE CAN -- MY GAS IS THAT HIS POSITION I'M I'M SPECULATING HERE BUT IN GENERAL WHEN BANKRUPTCY JUDGES RUN INTO FEDERAL REGULATORS TO TELL THEM TEY DON'T HAVE THE POWER TO DO THINGS. ON THE TREND IS FOR BANKRUPTCY JUDGES TO ALWAYS SAY NO WE DO HAVE THE POWER TO DO THINGS QUESTION I THINK ALL OF US CAN UNDERSTAND TO SOME EXTENT -- SO I WOULD EXPECT HIM TO TAKE THAT POSITION AND I WOULD EXPECT ULTIMATELY YOU KNOW THE JUST RECORDED THE NINTH CIRCUIT TO HAVE TO RESOLVE THAT QUESTION -- BUT I WOULD EXPECT THAT TO BE APPEALED AND YES THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THIS CHANGE -- ALSO I THINK THERE'S BEEN GROWTH AMONG COMMUNITY POWER AGGREGATORS AND OTHER. THINGS THAT ARE DIFFERENCE NOW SO IT'S NOT QUITE THE SAME BUSINESS THE WORLD HAS CHANGED AND OBVIOUSLY NOT THE SAME PREDICATE FACT PATTERN THAT DROVE THE COMPANY INTO BANKRUPTCY. THANK YOU PROFESSOR THANK YOU MATURE THANK YOU SIR. THUNDERSTORMS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR SOME IS A IT'S AN HONOR TO SERVE WITH YOU SIR ON THIS COMMITTEE THANK YOU FIRST TIME AND WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU SO. HI AND THANK YOU ONE A ONE A LOT TO ABSORB -- BUT A FEW QUESTIONS IF I MAY UM. MY MY MAIN CONCERN IS FOR THE RATE PAYERS [inaudible] AND I WANT TO KNOW -- A FEW THINGS ABOUT. HOW WE CAN ASSURE OUR? CONSTITUENTS ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF WHICH OF THE CURRENT P. JEANNIE TERRITORY THAT THE ELECTRICITY IS GONNA CONTINUE BASICALLY SAID IN CHAPTER. ELEVEN MOST OF THE CONSUMERS ARE NOT GOING TO NOTICE -- DIFFERENCE. BUT AND I ALL I KNOW THAT THERE'S ALSO A A NEXUS TO THE PC. SO AS THIS PROCESS GOES FORWARD -- THE PC IS GOING TO BE THE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO DETERMINE WHETHER OUT THERE CAN BE ANY RATE INCREASES SO. IS THERE AND I JUST WANNA BE G. P. YOU SEE IS COMING UP NEXT YES AND ANY QUESTIONS OF PC YOU CAN ASK THE OTHER YOU YOU'LL GET THEIR ANSWER. SO MY QUESTION IS. CAN. WE LEGALLY AND AND MY SAY WE MAY GET THE PC CAN A CAN THEY RAISE RATES. TO EFFECTUATE -- REVENUE STREAMS TO EFFECTUATE -- A SETTLEMENT. SO THAT THEY WILL BE IN IT THEY ALSO WILL AND BILL AND GIVE YOU A BETTER ANSWER TO THIS THAN I WELL BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS YES THAT THEY CAN AND THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT OFTEN HAPPENS IN UTILITY BANKRUPTCIES THERE ARE. RATE INCREASES THAT THAT AFFECTION WITH A SETTLEMENT AT THE ENDS BECAUSE TO SOME EXTENT IF YOU THINK OF THE BARGAINING TABLE AS BEING YOU KNOW THESE FOUR CHAIRS -- RATEPAYERS AREN'T AT THE TABLE -- SO TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU CAN LIKE COME UP WITH A PLAN THAT INVOLVES SOMEBODY ELSE KICKING IN MONEY TO MAKE EVERYBODY HAPPY HERE. I MEAN AS A BANKRUPTCY LAWYER AT AND I LIKE THAT IDEA TELL THEM. WHAT? ABOUT YES. WE HAVE ALSO SEEN IT'D BEEN A SIGNIFICANT SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CLAIMS AND I WOULD IMAGINE THAT. PROBABLY SOME OF THE LARGEST PLAINTIFFS -- SUING OUR INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT -- ATTEMPT TO SUBJUGATE DIDN'T RECOVER COSTS FOR A NUMBER OF STRUCTURES THAT HAVE BEEN -- LOST CAM CAN THIS JUDGE YOU'D LOOK UNILATERALLY CAN HE DISMISSED CLAIMS TO THE EXTENT THAT HE CAN PROTECT THE VIABILITY OF THIS COMPANY -- AT THE EXPENSE OF THESE THESE INSURANCE COMPANIES NOT FREE HE MADE WHOLE. SO ON WOULDN'T JUDGMENT TALLY WOULDN'T HAVE THE POWER TO DISMISS A CLAIM IF HE FELT THAT THE COMPANY NEEDED THIS CLAIM THIS MESS -- IN PART BECAUSE BANKRUPTCY LAW DOESN'T REQUIRE THIS SO THE PEOPLE WITH PRE BANKRUPTCY CLAIMS THEY'RE JUST FIGHTING OVER THE POOL OF ASSETS THAT'S THERE TO THE EXTENT THAT NO THEIR CLAIMS EXCEED THE POOL OF ASSETS MEANING THEY WON'T BE PAID IN FULL. IT'S REALLY A RELEVANCE TO WEATHER P. GENIES CAPABLE REORGANIZING AND SO ON JUDGE MENTALITY DOES HAVE THE OPTION OF USING DIFFERENT ESTIMATION METHODS DETERMINE WHETHER CLAIMS ARE VIABLE IF HE WANTS TO ENACTED COLOR. THE OUTCOMES FOR DIFFERENT PLAYERS MOVE BECAUSE THIS COMPANY CAN LEAVE BANKRUPTCY EVEN IF. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE MADE WHOLE. SO IT IS IT'S BEEN ALLEGED THAT -- THIS PARTICULAR COMPANY WAS NEGLIGENT AND AND PROTECTING THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE -- CAUSING SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS. DOES THE BANKRUPTCY JUDGE -- HAVE AN ABILITY TO TO MANDATE -- THAT THIS COMPANY IF THEY'RE ABLE TO EMERGE FROM CHAPTER -- ELEVEN MITIGATE ANY FUTURE DAMAGE BY FOLLOWING STATE LAW AND MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE IN A NEW AN ABNORMAL. THE FIRES ARE EXPECTED TO BE MORE PREVALENT. AND THAT THEY NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF PROTECTING THEMSELVES BECAUSE WE'RE COMING INTO A VERY RAINY YEAR THIS YEAR WHICH MEANS WE CAN HAVE A LOT OF FIRE -- FUELS. AND WE COULD BE BACK HERE AGAIN NEXT YEAR GOD FOR BID -- WITH WITH MORE FIRES IF BY THE UTILITY. TO MEDICAID FURTHER DAMAGE. YES SO -- JUDGMENT HOLLY DOES HAVE THAT POWER IN DIRECTLY NO ONE WAY TO THINK ABOUT WITH THE BANKRUPTCY JUDGE RIGHT NOW IS IS THAT HE'S KIND OF LIKE YOU KNOW THE GOD OF P. JEANNIE HE HAS ALL POWER OVER THEM IS LIKE A ONE PERSON REGULATOR. WHO CAN DO A LOT OF WHAT HE WANTS BECAUSE THEY'RE DIFFERENT PROVISIONS OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE THAT WOULD ALLOW HIM TO MAKE WHATEVER ORDER HE WANTED TO GO? SO TO THE EXTENT YOU KNOW WITHIN REASON OBVIOUSLY SO TO THE EXTENT OF THAT -- YOU KNOW HE WERE TO DECIDE THE P. GENIE IS BOB P. JEANNIE WILL HAVE TO PROMISE TO OBEY STATE LAWS TO GET A PLAN OF ORGANIZATION APPROVED OKAY -- INTO THE SENSE THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU WERE TO SAY WHAT HE NEEDS NOT FEASIBLE UNLESS THEY MAKE MONSTER INVESTMENTS AND SAFETY. YOU KNOW THAT'S A CHOICE YOU CAN MAKE IN THAT CHOICE PROBABLY REDIRECTS VALUE FROM PRE BANKRUPTCY CREDITORS TO P. JEANNIE SAFETY INVESTMENTS OKAY MY FINAL QUESTION IS. EXPLAIN A SCENARIO. WHERE P. JEANNIE WOULD HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO GO TO CHAPTER ELEVEN WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN? FOR THE DELIVERANCE OF ELECTRICITY AND THE FUTURE OF PROVIDING UTILITIES ELECTRICAL UTILITY SERVICES OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I MEAN IF THEY WERE TO HAVE TO GO TO CHAPTER ELEVEN AGAIN NOT THEY WERE TO GO TO CHAPTERS -- SINCE AFTER SEVEN YEAH WHAT AS SEVEN TOP TIMING BUT HOW WOULD PROCEED TO CHAPTER SEVEN COULD PROCEED TO CHAPTER SEVEN IF A COULD HOW WITH THAT. WHAT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE SO -- AS A MATTER OF LAW IT IS POSSIBLE EITHER A A MOTION COULD BE FOUND FOR THE JUDGE COULD ORDER THE CONVERSION OF THE CASE TO CHAPTER. SEVEN IN PRACTICE I THINK THAT'S ALMOST A 100% UNLIKELY IF THAT WERE TO HAPPEN WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE WOULD BE SALES OF P. GENIES ASSETS I WOULD ASSUME THERE LIKE TRICITY ASSETS. AND I ASSUME THE BUYERS WOULD BE OTHER PUBLIC UTILITIES ON IN PRACTICE I I WOULD HAVE TO IMAGINE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE CAN SPEECH ANY CONSUMER AND I'M A P. JEANNIE CONSUMER. WE WOULDN'T NOTICE ANY OF THIS TO BE LIKE IN SOME FAR OFF LANDS THE OWNERSHIP THE P. JEANNIE ASSETS WITH CHANGING HANDS AND EVENTUALLY START GETTING BILL BY SOMEBODY ELSE -- BUT YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S AND IT'S HIGHLY UNLIKELY THING TO HAVE HAPPEN JUDGMENT HOLLY WOULD BE EXTRAORDINARILY UNLIKELY TO ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN -- BECAUSE IN CHAPTER ELEVEN THERE ARE CHECKS AND SAFEGUARDS TO MAKE IT EASIER TO HAVE A MORE INCLUSIVE PROCESS OF DECISION MAKING AND TO HELP DECIDE WHAT WILL HAPPEN WITH THESE ASSETS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU FOR A MINUTE. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU PROFESSOR FOR BEING HERE -- WHAT DID YOU TO DRILL DOWN A COUPLE POINTS YOU RAISED -- ON THIS JURISDICTIONAL QUESTION -- OF A BANKRUPTCY VERSUS BURKE I KNOW THERE'S SORT OF SPLIT CIRCUIT OPINIONS TO SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK WENT ONE WAY. IN THE THIRD THE FIFTH ONE ANOTHER WAY. NOW THE NINTH. WILL. IN THEORY WEIGH IN AT SOME POINT SOON -- DO YOU SEE THIS THEN I DON'T KNOW IF THERES OTHER PENDING CASES GOING ON AROUND THE COUNTRY BUT DO YOU SEE THIS GOOD. JURISDICTION JUST I MEAN THREE QUARTERS DIRECT JURISDICTION OVER FEDERAL QUESTION LIKE THIS. COULD YOU SEE THIS GETTING APPEALED THERE AND IF SO. JUST WALK US THROUGH THAT TIME LINE. SO IT IS IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THIS COULD REACH THE SUPREME COURT'S BECAUSE LIKE YOU SAID THERE IS A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION. I'M I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS ARE OUT THERE BUT THEY'RE CERTAINLY NUMBER BANKRUPTCY COURTS AND I AM THAT HAVE WEIGHED IN ON THIS BUT THERE'S NOTHING THAT IS BINDING ON THIS PROCESS -- IN PRACTICE YOU COULD SEE APPEALS ALL THE WAY TO THE SUPREME COURT'S NOW YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AN APPEAL PROCESS THAT TAKES YEARS -- YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT THE NINETY FINAL WORD ON BECAUSE PRACTICALLY THE WAY BANKRUPTCY APPEALS TENDS TO WORK IS -- QUESTIONS CAN BECOME MOOT OR NOT YOU KNOW THAT AND IT'S LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED HERE IN THE NINTH CIRCUIT -- BUT QUESTIONS CAN BECOME MOOT TO CAN BECOME HARDER TO APPEAL THINGS -- BUT IT'S RATE RELATIVELY UNUSUAL pSUPREME COURT THIS COULD HAPPEN -- BUT YET THEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A YEAR YOU KNOW A COUPLE YEARS OF LITIGATION AND THAT SEEMS. LESS LIKELY IT DOESN'T QUITE SYNC UP WITH THE EXCLUSIVITY PERIOD EITHER WRITING THEORY THAT WOULD ECLIPSE THAT THE EXCLUSIVITY IF IT DID GET. IT WHAT IT WHERE YOU GOT STATE LEADERS I MEAN IF THE NINTH CIRCUIT. IT WOULDN'T FOOD INTAKE AFFECT IN OTHER WORDS. ALSO IMAGINE THAT WHAT P. JEANNIE WILL DO IS THEY'LL THREATEN TO TEAR UP CONTRACTS MAYBE THE FILE MOTIONS TO TEAR THEM UP AND BUT IF THEY'RE ABLE TO REACH NEGOTIATED RESOLUTIONS WITH THE COUNTERPARTIES ON THE OTHER SIDE MAYBE. FOR YOU KNOW RIGHT I DON'T KNOW RIGHT -- SO THANK YOU FOR THAT OTHER QUESTION IS ABOUT -- ELABORATING FURTHER ON THE FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS I KNOW THERE'S A MULTI FACTOR TEST THE FEASIBILITY IS ONE OF MANY. THERE'S ALSO THE BEST INTEREST TEST WHICH IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER WHETHER YOU'RE. LOOKING AT THE THE RELATIVE VALUE PURSES FULL LIQUIDATION OF WHICH IT JUST WONDERING HOW. WHAT MAKES YOU BELIEVE THAT FEES ABILITIES ARE TO REQUIRES A MULTI YEAR SOLUTION JUST LOOKING AT PRESIDENT THERE CAN YOU ELABORATE ON THAT? SO THE WAY THAT REQUIREMENTS HAS TYPICALLY BEEN INTERPRETED BY THE COURTS IT'S REQUIRES A FINDING FROM THE JUDGE THAT -- THIS BANKRUPTCY IS UNLIKE OTHER BANKRUPTCY AND OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN'T PREDICT THE FUTURE SO IN A PREDICTIONS ANY YEAR A MUCH MORE RELIABLE THAN PREDICTIONS IN.% TEN YEARS OR SO IT TENDS TO BE AN ANALYSIS FOR THE JUDGE LOOKS AT IT AND IT'S ANALYSIS LIKE KILL HAVE NUMBERS IN FRONT OF HIM. BUT IT'S A DO I THINK BASED ON WITH THIS COMPANIES PROPOSING THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO GO BACK INTO BANKRUPTCY AGAIN AND RECENTLY YOU'RE SEEING A NUMBER OF RETAILERS WE'RE GOING INTO BANKRUPTCY COMING OUT AND FILING AGAIN IMMEDIATELY. AND THERE THE JUDGE JUST MADE A JUDGMENT CLL THAT THIS COMPANY IS LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO SURVIVE AND WAS PROVEN NOT TO BE TRUE. SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT SOMETHING LIKE THAT COULD HAPPEN HERE BUT MY GUESS IS THE JUDGE MENTALITY WILL CARE VERY MUCH ABOUT FEASIBILITY AND MAKING SURE THE P. GENIE IS NOT LIKELY. TO GO BACK INTO BANKRUPTCY WHICH REQUIRE SOME SORT OF PLAN FOR FUTURE WILDFIRE LIABILITY. IN FINAL QUESTION BECAUSE GOING TO THAT OTHER FACTOR THAT BEST INTEREST TEST IS THE IS THE WORK GOING ON IN THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION WHERE THEY'VE SORT OF PUT OUT THERE -- I FORGET EXACTLY WITH THE FOR IF IT WAS A AYE AYE OR SOME SOME SOME ORDER. ABOUT LOOKING AT SORT OF THE GOVERNING STRUCTURES -- OPTIONS WITHIN P. JEANNIE ARE HAVING MULTIPLE SMALLER UTILITIES POTENTIALLY. LOOK RETHINKING HOW THE THEY MANAGE GOVERNANCE A GAS AND ELECTRICITY DELIVERY AND THE WHOLESALE SIDE LIKE. DOES THAT ACTUALLY DOES THAT AFFECT. THEN THE BEST INTERESTS TESTER ANY OF THE SORT OF FACTORS THE JUDGE WILL BE LOOKING AT DEPENDING ON WHAT. HOW MUCH MORE FLESHED OUT THAT LIQUIDATION SCENARIO LOOKS FROM OUR REGULATORS REMOVED FROM US? EVERY WITH EIGHT DO THEY HAVE TO TAKE SOME OF THAT INTO ACCOUNT IN IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT WHAT THE THIRTY COMPARATIVE VALUES. SO ARE ARE YOU SPEAKING ABOUT A SITUATION WHERE P. JEANNIE COULD BE REDUCED INTO SMALLER PARTS YES YES -- SO A SITUATION LIKE THAT ISN'T IMPOSSIBLE IT PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE DONE AS A LIQUIDATION IT WOULD BE MORE DONE AS AND SALE OF DIFFERENT ASSETS -- WHICH IS IT BUT I MEAN IT SOUNDS THE SAME AS A LIQUIDATION BUT A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT -- DO I THINK THAT THE JUDGE WOULD IS ON THE TABLE I THINK THAT HE'D HAVE. TO CENTER RUBIO. YEAH I'M SORRY YES IN A RUDE. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR THE INFORMATION US I BELIEVE FIVE SENATORS DON'T SEND A IT'S A LOT OF INFORMATION COMING OUT AS JUST A LITTLE CURIOUS ABOUT THE AD HOC COMMITTEES I BELIEVE YOU MENTIONED. THERE WERE AGITATORS SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS WHO MAKES UP THESE GROUPS AND DO YOU ANTICIPATE THEY'RE GONNA BE TRYING TO WORK THE BUILDING WORK THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD WE BE LOOKING OUT FOR THESE GROUPS -- SO THE PRACTICE AMONG BANKRUPTCY LAWYERS IS THAT WHEN A COMPANY FALLS INTO FINANCIAL DISTRESS THE CREDITORS ORGANIZE AND THE PARTIES THE TEND TO ORGANIZE THE CREDITORS. ARE LAWYERS SO THERE IS A LAW FIRM IN NEW YORK FOR EXAMPLE THAT IS REPRESENTING THE AD HOC GROUP OF P. JEANNIE BOND HOLDERS AND I THINK THERE MIGHT BE OTHER LAW FIRMS REPRESENTING OTHER. AD HOC GROUPS OF P. JEANNIE BOND HOLDERS THAT MAYBE HAVE FACTUALLY DIFFERENT SITUATIONS MAY BE THEIR SMALLER VERSES ONE IS A GROUP OF HEDGE FUNDS -- YOU CAN THE SAID THAT IS HOW THEIR FORMS THEIR FORMED IN THIS VERY INFORMAL WAY AND LIKE I SAID THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN AN AD HOC COMMITTEE AND AN OFFICIAL ONE IS AN OFFICIAL ONE GETS THEIR LAWYERS PAID FOR BY P. JEANNIE. PURSES AD HOC ONES -- THEY'RE PAYING FOR THEIR LAWYERS THEMSELVES WHICH IS SOME WAY IS A SIGNAL OF THEIR COMMITMENT -- WHAT I EXPECT THEM TO COME IN WORK THE BUILDING I WOULD -- I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF THEY DID AND I WAS ONCE WORKING ON BE. YOU KNOW TO TO NOT TO WORK THEN THE WRONG WORD TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS AND TO TRY TO EDUCATE -- AND EXPLAIN TO YOU KNOW THE ETHICAL REGULATORY BODY. WHY IT IS THAT YOU KNOW WE THOUGHT SOMETHING SHOULD HAPPEN OR NOT -- AND YOU KNOW YES I WOULD EXPECT THAT YOU WILL HEAR FROM THEM THANK YOU FOR THAT. THANK YOU SIR HERTZBERG. DID YOU ATTEND ANY OF THE HEARINGS IN THIS CASE -- I DID NOT BUT I SENT SOME STUDENTS ON MY BEHALF WHO TOLD ME SOME THINGS BUT I KNOW I DID NOT I I LISTEN TO PARTS OF THEM. DID AND IF I CAN JUST. ADD TO WHAT THOSE ARE MORE LIKE ASKED ABOUT COLOR IN THE CASE OR ANYTHING -- THAT YOU LEARN FROM THOSE THINGS THAT COULD BE INSIGHTFUL TO SHARE WITH THIS COMMITTEE. IN YOUR JUDGMENT IT WAS REPORTED TO A YOU LISTEN -- TO MY MY JUDGMENT IS THAT THIS CASE IS IN A VERY PRELIMINARY PAY PLACE YOU KNOW THERE IS THERE ARE MOTIONS ON THE TABLE TO STABILIZE P. GENIES BUSINESS. AND THEN THERE'S JUST A LOT OF ACTION AROUND THE EDGES YOU THE PPA ISSUES -- YOU HAVE VARIOUS MOTIONS WHICH WILL CALL THEM IF THEY MOTIONS THAT ARE BEING FILED -- WHERE VARIOUS PARTIES ARE SAYING REALLY LATE HOURS GO AHEAD -- AND YOU'RE JUST IN A VERY PRELIMINARY PLACE WHERE YOU'RE NOT YET SEEN THE LEADERSHIP OUT OF P. JEANNIE WHICH WOULD SAY THIS IS WHERE THIS IS GOING. YOU'RE IN THE BUSINESS STABILIZATION PHASE OF THE CASE -- IN JUDGMENT HOLLY IS REALLY BEING JUDICIOUS IN SAYING YOU KNOW IF THERE'S A CONTENTIOUS ISSUE LET'S WAIT A LITTLE WHILE TO RULE ON IT LET'S SEE WE CAN COME TO SOME CONCLUSIONS -- OR YOU CAN NEGOTIATED RETEK REACHES SETTLEMENT I THINK ONE THING YOU WOULD START TO SEE FROM JUDGMENT HOLLY IS THE INSTINCT THAT YOU WOULD. YOU EXPECT HIM TO SHOW BASED ON HIS REPUTATION THAT HE IS TRYING TO PROD PEOPLE TO COME TO A DEAL OUTSIDE THE COURTROOM AS OPPOSED TO HIM. MAKING RULINGS AND EVERYTHING THAT RING AND IN THAT REGARD -- FROM YOUR OBSERVATIONS AMONG THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT YOU HAVE AND FRIENDS AND THE LIKE IN AROUND THE BANKRUPTCY. TO THE GOVERNOR'S STATE OF THE STATE WERE INDICATED THAT HE WANTS TO FOCUS ON SOME SOLUTION IN SIXTY DAYS HAVE ANY IMPACT ON THE DISCUSSION FROM YOUR JUDGMENT -- I ACTUALLY THINK THAT IT HAD A SURPRISINGLY LARGE IMPACT ON BASED ON WHAT I'VE HEARD -- AGAIN IN INFORMAL CONVERSATIONS WITH INVESTORS -- IT IS. AND YOU KNOW THEY'RE LIKE THE CITY THEN PUBLISHED A RESEARCH NOTE SAYING ALL IT LOOKS LIKE ALL INTO THE SKY IS BLUE AND ALL IS CLEAR THE GOVERNOR'S REALLY ENGAGED -- I WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED GIVEN THAT THERE WERE FOCUSED IT WAS RESEARCH WAS ASKED REASSURED BY THAT AS THEY HAVE BEEN IF YOU LOOK AT THE MARKET PRICES OF P. GENIES BONDS -- IT'S AT LEAST THE LAST I CHECKED ON THE MARKET SEEMS TO THINK THAT THE BOND HOLDERS ARE GOING TO BE PEYTON FALL SO THAT WOULD IMPLY THAT EITHER THERE'S LESS LIVE BLESSED LOUD FIRE LIABILITY THAN WE THOUGHT MEANING P. JEANNIE. WON'T HAVE TO PAY AS MUCH TO WILD FIRE VICTIMS AS PERHAPS THEY WORRY -- OR THAT THERE'S AN EXPECTATION OF SOME SORT OF LEGISLATURE EVER GUBERNATORIAL INTERVENTION -- BUT YES I THINK THAT THAT WAS A STATEMENT THAT THE MARKET HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR AND I THINK PEOPLE TOOK IT FOR YOU KNOW HEARING WHAT THEY WANTED TO HEAR TO SOME EXTENT. OKAY -- CENTER MCGUIRE. THANK YOU BYE CENTER BROAD. WHICH IS THE CHAIR AND GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY SIR -- JUST TWO VERY QUICK QUESTIONS ONE HAS TO DO WITH PRESIDENT IN -- IN PARTICULAR -- DISASTER VICTIMS WHAT TYPE PRESIDENT CAN YOU POINT TO OR CAN YOU. WHERE -- DISASTER VICTIMS. YOU SEE SOME TYPE OF COMPENSATION. DURING ANY TYPE OF BANKRUPTCY OF UTILITY IS THERE ANYTHING TO BE ABLE TO POINT TO THAT YOU KNOW. OF ANY CASE LAW OUT THERE. SO THERE ARE UTILITY CASES. WHERE STUFF LIKE THIS HAPPENS WHAT COMES TO MIND A LITTLE BIT MORE READILY ARE CASES WHERE YOU HAVE COMPANIES THAT MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS THAT HURT PEOPLE WHETHER THEY CONTAIN ASBESTOS WHICH IS OUR MANAGER IS OFTEN A SITUATION -- THERE DEFINITELY A LOTS OF I DISASTERS WHAT WE'D CALL MASSPORT SITUATIONS ENDS THERE ARE PLENTY OF THOSE CASES THAT PROVIDED IZEABLE OR EVEN RECOVERIES AND FALL TO THOSE CREDITORS. THANK YOU SO MUCH IN THE SECOND PIECE IS IN REGARDS TO THE POWER PURCHASE CONTRACTS -- AND THE ISSUE OF STATE LAW. SO -- STATE IS BEEN VERY CLEAR WHERE WE NEED TO BE ADDED -- THEIR CLIMATE GOALS BOTH WITH THE TAIL PIPE IS WELL AS ON OUR PARA PROCUREMENT. SO THEY WOULDN'T POTENTIALLY COULD BE ABLE TO CUT THOSE CONTRACTS THAT ARE PLACE BUT THEY STILL HAVE. TO FACE STATE LAW THAT MANDATES. THEM POTENTIALLY GETTING BACK INTO THOSE CONTRACTS BUT REALLY THIS IS MORE POLITICAL AND TRYING TO BE A DRIVE A CHEAPER RATE -- IS THAT ACCURATE. SO -- A COUPLE OF THINGS SO FIRST I I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH ALL OF THE DETAILS OF THE CLEAN ENERGY MANDATES THAT P. JEANNIE HAS TO DEAL WITH WHEN P. GENIE COMES OUT OF BANKRUPTCY THEY DO HAVE TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH STATE LAW. MEANING THEY HAVE TO BE ACTING IN A WAY THAT THE REGULATORY EXPECTS THEM TO THEY HAVE TO DO THE THINGS THAT YOU EXPECT THEM TO DO -- AND I WOULD ASSUME THAT COLORS THE DECISIONS THAT BILL MAKING BANKRUPTCY CASE -- BECAUSE ONE PART OF A FEASIBLE PLAN WILL BE BEING IN A POSITION TO COMPLY WITH STATE LAW -- WHETHER THAT MEANS THAT THEY YOU KNOW LITIGATE WITH YOU KNOW PPA COUNTERPARTIES RATHER COUNTERPARTIES AND TRY TO CHANGE SOME OF THE STRUCTURE ALONG THE WAY I DON'T KNOW. BUT THEY DO NEED LIKE THEY NEED TO OBEY STATE LAW THERE IN BANKRUPTCY AND AFTERWARDS AND AND THAT'S WHY -- AS A NON LAWYER I DAY. OUT WHERE -- TRYING TO BE ABLE TO FIND. MORE ATTRACTIVE TERMS OF CONTRACT BUT STILL IT KNOWING THAT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET HALF OF THE POWER SUPPLY FROM A GREEN. A CERTIFIED AGREEMENT NOBLE SOURCE -- AND THAT IS A CENTER THAT COULD POTENTIALLY PLAY UP I THINK THAT THAT IS CORRECT BASED ON MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE RENEWABLE MANDATE SAYS WALLACE PEKINGESE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT WHICH WILL DISRUPT. SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE INDUSTRY WHO'VE BEEN COUNTING ON WHAT THOSE RATES ARE -- AND THAT WILL HAVE A TRICKLE DOWN EFFECT OBVIOUSLY SO THAT THAT IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE. CENTER BRADFORD THEN FOLLOWED BY SENATOR DODD THANK YOU MISSED YOUR ON I'M JUST CURIOUS AS IT COMES TO ASSESSING A LIABILITY WHETHER IT BE ON P. GINNY WE KEEP HEARING -- THE NEW NORM IN CLIMATE CHANGE AND I'M TRYING TO SEE WHAT DEGREE WILL THAT BE FACTORED IN. BECAUSE I IF YOU LOOK AT HISTORICALLY -- UTILITIES OF CALLS NO MORE FIRES TODAY THAN THEY DID TWENTY THIRTY YEARS AGO THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS YOU GOT MORE FUEL OUT THERE YET. I DROUGHT SEASON SO WILL YOU FACTOR WILL TEACH A COURT TO FACTOR IN. CLIMATE CHANGE AND ON MANAGE FORCED BY BOTH THANK YOU SIR I THINK THE ANSWER TO THAT IS THAT. JUST MONTHS HOW HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION BECAUSE IT GOES AGAIN TO THE FEASIBILITY OF ANY BANKRUPTCY PLAN P. JEANNIE HOUSE. THEY CAN'T HAVE A PLAN THAT'S DESIGNED FOR THE DROUGHT CONDITIONS OR LEVEL OF FUEL THAT EXISTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE THEY HAVE TO HAVE A PLAN THAT WORKS WITH THE DROUGHT CONDITIONS AND THAT YOU KNOW THE TORT LIABILITY -- ENVIRONMENT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TODAY SO I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD STRONGLY EXPECTS JUDGMENTS HOLLY TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION. AND I I JUST BE BACK ON THAT. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT HARDEN AGREE I'D AND LYING CLEARING SOMETIMES LINE CLEARNESS A FACTOR OF? ACCESS TO PROPERTY STILL WILL THAT ALSO BE FACTORED IN BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES YOU CAN'T ACCESS SOME PROPERTIES BUDGET THEIR FEDERAL LANDS ARE PROBABLY ONLY ANSWER THAT. THEY WON'T LET HIM WANT TO CLEAR. SO -- I'M NOT I'M NOT SUPER DEEPLY AND I'M FAMILIAR WITH THE WORLD OF CLEARING TREES FROM FEDERAL AND STATE LANDS BUT I WILL SAY THAT THERE TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT CREATES A BARRIER THAT MEANS THE P. JEANNIE. CAN'T LEAVE BANKRUPTCY SAYING TO THE JUDGE JUDGE WE'VE ELIMINATED ALL OF THE POTENTIAL BECAUSE WILDFIRES THAT ARE MASSIVELY DAMAGING IN THE FUTURE. IN THAT CASE YOU WOULD EXPECT THE P. JEANNIE MIGHT BE ABLE TO NEED TO SAY. YOUR ON YOUR HONOR -- WE HAVE SOME SORT OF INSURANCE SOLUTION BECAUSE WE AREN'T ABLE TO LIMIT ALL LIABILITY THAT WE MIGHT HAVE AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY FACE A REGULATORY LANDSCAPE. OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION AND THE INABILITY TO YOU KNOW TAKE OVER AROUND POWER LINES AND PUT THEM UNDERGROUND OR DO OTHER THINGS YOU NEED TO TO THEN. BECOME LESS LIKELY THAT THEY'RE QUICK MEN'S MAY PLAY A ROLE IN FUTURE FIRES -- YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT THEN ENSURING STORY THEY'RE TELLING ABOUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE A PROSPEROUS AND THRIVING COMPANY IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU SIR SENATOR DOT. YEAH THANK YOU UP FAST REALIZE FOR BEING HERE THAT. THEY'RE VERY GOOD -- PRESENTATION -- OBSERVER WIRE BROUGHT UP ABOUT PRESIDENT -- FOR VICTIMS. YOU KNOW I I'M HEARING SOME -- YOU KNOW TALK AROUND THE THE EDGES SO TO SPEAK AS YOU -- SAID ABOUT -- A MOVE AFOOT TO TRY TO HAVE SOME SORT OF A QUICK SETTLEMENT. FOR VICTIMS I'M JUST WONDERING I'VE I I COULD EVEN IMAGINE HOW THAT. PROCESS WOULD WORK -- HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THAT AT ALL AND HOW THAT COULD HAPPEN. THE BANKRUPTCY LOS STRONGLY PROMOTES SETTLEMENT -- AND WITH THIS MEANS THAT ON TO THE SENSE THAT EVERYBODY READY GET SET AROUND THE TABLE AND AGREED JUDGE WE'VE SOLVED ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS THE JUDGE WITH AND BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO BLAST THAT. AND SND IT'S ON ITS WAY -- IT CERTAINLY SEEMS UNLIKELY GIVEN MY KNOWLEDGE OF THE FACTS THAT NEED TO BE FOUND IN CONNECTION WITH ALL THE POTENTIAL WHILE FOR LIABILITY THAT MIGHT BE OUT THERE -- AND YOU KNOW TO THE EXTENT THE P. JEANNIE DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY ALL THE ASSERTED CLAIMS YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE A CLAIM THAT IS GOOD YOU MAY YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE STANDING IN BANKRUPTCY COURT. THAN OBJECTS TO SOMEBODY WHO IS A CLAIM THAT YOU FEEL IS NOT AS GOOD SO IT CERTAINLY IS POSSIBLE THAT THERE COULD BE A QUICK SETTLEMENT TO FLY. BUT ABSENT THE RESOURCES TO SORT OF MAKE EVERYBODY HAPPY -- IT'S MUCH MORE LIKELY THAT WE'LL SEE LITIGATION [inaudible] THERE'S GONNA. I'M THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU'RE FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION LEARNED A LOT. I'M FOLLOWING UP ON ANGLE AROUND THIS QUESTION OF THE FIRE VICTIMS CLAIMS. IF I UNDERSTOOD YOU RIGHT THE THE CLAIMS THAT ARE RELEVANT IN THIS BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING ARE THOSE THAT WERE MADE FREE THE FILING OF THE BANKRUPTCY DID I UNDERSTAND THAT CORRECT OR NO SO THAT IS NOT CORRECT OKAY -- SO -- I'M I APOLOGIZE FOR MISS SPEAKING SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE WERE LAWSUITS THAT WERE FILED PRIOR TO THE BANKRUPTCY THAT'S PART OF THE STORY OF WHY THEY'RE IN BANKRUPTCY. TO THE EXTENT THERE PEOPLE WHO SUFFERED DAMAGES THAT THEY HAVE YET TO SEE WINE AND THEY STILL CAN WITHIN THE APPLICABLE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. THEY'RE WELCOME TO FILE A CLAIM WITH THE BANKRUPTCY COURTS THEY WELCOME TO PARTICIPATE IN THE BANKRUPTCY PROCESS AND ACTUALLY -- THE WAY BANKRUPTCY ALL WORKS IS THAT EVEN IF THEY DON'T FILE A CLAIM -- THEY STILL CAN BE SUBJECT TO SO IT IS IN THEIR STRONG INTEREST TO FILE A CLAIM BECAUSE THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO RECEIVE WHATEVER VALUE WAS THERE TO PAY THEM SO YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT PART OF WHAT THIS BANKRUPTCY IS GOING TO BE. IS TRYING TO PRIDE EVERYONE WHO HAS A CLEAN FOR LIABILITY TO ASSERT AT IN THE PROCESS OF A CERTI IT IS GOING TO BE GOING ON A FOREMAN FILLING OUT A WE'RE GOING ON A WEBSITE AND FILL OUT A FORM. SO ACTUALLY I WOULD EXPECT LOTS OF PEOPLE WITH CLAIMS THAT ARE VERY GOOD TO FILE THOSE CLAIMS I WOULD ALSO EXPECT THE COMPANY WILL HAVE A PROCESS. OF WEEDING THROUGH PEOPLE WHO YOU KNOW. A CERTAIN TEN MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF CLAIMS ON YOU KNOW ANON AN IMPLAUSIBLE FACT PATTERN FOR TEN MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF CLAIMS -- SO WE FOLLOWING UP ON THAT WE THERE ARE CLEARLY SOME OF THE FIRES FOR WHICH INVESTIGATIONS HAVE BEEN COMPLETE. AND SOME LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY HAS BEEN ASSIGNED. THERE ARE SUBSEQUENT ONES WHERE THAT HAS NOT OCCURRED YET. AND SO HOW HOW DO THOSE FACTORS IN THIS -- IN THE BANKRUPTCY -- IS SO THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE CLAIMED SO. YOU SHOULD THINK OF EVERYBODY WAS A CLAIM AS HAVING A BODY OF EVIDENCE THAT SUPPORTS THAT CLAIM. AND SO TO THE EXTENT THERE BEEN FINDINGS BY CAL FIRE OTHERS THAT P. GENIE IS LIABLE OR P. GENIES ADMITTING LIABILITY. THOSE ARE FACTS THAT ARE HELPFUL FOR THAT PERSON IN ASSERTING THE CLAIM YOU COULD YOU COULD ALSO IMAGINE THOUGH THAT PERHAPS. YOU KNOW HIGHLY MOTIVATED SHAREHOLDERS COULD FILED BECAUSE HIRE THEIR OWN EXPERTS TO TRY TO DISPUTE WHATEVER THOSE FACTUAL FINDINGS WERE IF THEY WANTED -- TO SO YOU EXPECTED THE KNOW THAT TO BE HELPFUL EVIDENCE FOR WHOEVER IS ASSERTING CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES -- A BUT THERE STILL COULD BE A LITIGATION HAVE CLAIMS THAT WERE THERE HAVE NOT YET BEEN FINDINGS FROM ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES FROM CAL FIRE OR FROM OTHERS OR P. GENIE IS HAS NOT YET ADMITTED LIABILITY -- THEY JUST HAVE MORE WORK TO DO AND TRYING TO PROVE TO THE COURTS THAT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO BE PAID -- WHATEVER IT IS AND YOU CAN ASSUME THAT THOSE INVESTIGATIONS COULD INFORM THE JUDGES FACT FINDING BUT THE JUDGE MAY ALSO DECIDE HE'S NOT GOING TO WAIT FOR ALL OF THAT FACT FINDING. NO HE WOULD HAVE THAT OPTION IF YOU WANTED TO SO THEN FINALLY -- GOING BACK -- TO SENATOR GUARDS QUESTION SO -- AS YOU DESCRIBED IT'S YOU KNOW BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS THE JUDGE ONE TO GET. WANT TO GET SETTLEMENTS THEY WANT TO RESOLVE THESE THINGS. AND YET. YOU ALSO SPECULATED THAT AROUND THE FIRE CLAIMS THAT MAY NOT HAPPEN. IT MAY NOT HAPPEN IMMEDIATELY IN A IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS WHERE THERE ISN'T AN OBVIOUS TO DEAL TO BE HAD ONE WOULD ASSUME THAT EVEN IF THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION IS SETTLEMENT YOU'RE LOOKING AT A LOT OF LITIGATION. SO. EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT AND I I AND MY GUESS IS THAT EVEN IF YOU KNOW MOST FIRE VICTIMS -- THEIR LAWYERS AND TO THIS COMPANY WERE TO COME TO RESOLUTION YOU'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO FILE CLAIMS WHERE EVERYONE LOOKS AT AND SAYS YOU DID NOT SUFFER THESE DAMAGES OR THESE DAMAGES WERE NOT P. GENIES FAULT IN THERE WILL STILL BE LITIGATION. OVER THOSE CLAIMANTS BUT I WOULD IMAGINE THE FINAL NUMBER OF CLAIMS THAT WILL BE FILED WILL BE EXTRAORDINARILY LARGE. THANK OU VERY MUCH HE WAS EXTREMELY EDUCATIONAL. AND ELIMINATING WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF EXPERTS AND YOU'RE DEFINITELY UP THE CATEGORY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER I'VE LEARNED A LOT OF CHAIR AND RETAKING THE BAR THIS SUMMER. WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT -- AND ALL. WE HAVE ELLIS STEBBINS WITH THAT SHE IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. TO GET TOGETHER WITH OUR ECCLES. EYELASH -- HE'S THE GENERAL COUNSEL OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. MATT AND I HOPE YOU STUDIED UNDER UNDER PROFESSOR ALLIANCE.

I'M GONNA GO OVER A VERY QUICK OVERVIEW AND THEN WE HAVE WE WILL RESPOND TO SEVERAL QUESTIONS THAT WERE PROVIDED TO US EARLIER [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. SO AGAIN THANK YOU THE IMPLICATIONS OF P. GENIES DECISION TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY ARE A VITAL MATTER MATTER FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE OF THE COMMISSION'S PRIOR EXPERIENCE IN THE ENERGY CRISIS WE'RE ACUTELY AWARE OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF UTILITY-BANKRUPTCY FOR THE STATE'S CLEAN ENERGY PROGRAMS. VULNERABLE LOW INCOME RATE PAYERS CLEAN TECH BUSINESSES AND THE ECONOMY. THE COMMISSION IS COMMITTED TO FINDING THE BEST POWER FORWARD TO PROVIDE RATE PAYERS AND SAFE AND RELIABLE SERVICE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AT THE FOREFRONT OF ALL OF OUR MINDS OF COURSE IS THE FIRE VICTIMS. WE ARE GLAD THE BANKRUPTCY COURT FOLLOW THE GOVERNOR'S REQUEST TO APPOINT A COMMITTEE CONSISTING OF REPRESENTATIVES OF WILD FIRE VICTIMS. TO ENSURE THAT THE VICTIMS WILL HAVE STRONG REPRESENTATION IN THE COURT ROOM. I WANT TO TOUCH BRIEFLY ON THE EFFORTS OF THE COMMISSION IN RESPONSE TO P. GENIES BANKRUPTCY. AS GOVERNOR NEWSOME NOTED IN THE STATE OF STATE ADDRESS HE HAS CAN BE IN A TASK FORCE OF CRITICAL STATE AGENCIES TO ADDRESS THE MULTIPLE FACETS OF THE BANKRUPTCY. THE COMMISSION IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS EFFORT. THE TASK FORCE BUILD ON THE COLLABORATION THAT OCCURRED DURING THE FIFTEEN DAY WINDOW BETWEEN PGA ANY ANNOUNCING IT WAS FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY AND THE ACTUAL FILING. DURING THIS TIME THE COMMISSION CAREFULLY MONITOR THE SITUATION AND WORK CLOSELY WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THE CHI SO TO ENSURE THAT ELECTRIC AND GAS SERVICE. WOULD NOT BE INTERRUPTED THANKFULLY IT WAS NOT. THE COMMISSION HAS UNIQUE STANDING TO DEFEND THE INTERESTS OF CALIFORNIA RATE PAYERS AND THE INTERESTS OF THE STATE MORE BROADLY IN THE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS. AS WAS THE CASE IN IN EARLY TWO THOUSANDS THE COMMISSION AS A PARTY IN THE PGA ANY BANKRUPTCY. THIS MEANS THE COMMISSION WAS THERE ON DAY ONE OF THE BANKRUPTCY HARIAN AND WE'RE READY PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF CALIFORNIA AND RATE PAYERS MOVING FORWARD. IN RESPONSE TO THE BANKRUPTCY FILING THE COMMISSION HAS ALSO REVIEWED CRITICAL SAFETY AND PUBLIC PURPOSE PROGRAMS TO MAKE SURE THAT P. JEANNIE CAN CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT STATE PRIORITIES AND POLICIES. DURING THE BANKRUPTCY. WHICH PROFESSOR ALLY IS ACTUALLY REALLY -- EXPANDED ON THE COMMISSION CONTINUES TO COOPERATE AND COORDINATE WITH OUR FELLOW AGENCIES SUCH AS CAL FIRE AND CAL OR WE US TO PREPARE FOR THE UPCOMING WILDFIRE SEASON. YOU RECEIVED A HAND OUT -- JUST KIND OF A JUST GOING OVER SB NINE NO ONE AND WILD FIRES. THE COMMISSION IS MOVING QUICKLY TO IMPLEMENT ALL OVER WILD FAR RELATED RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDING REVIEWING WILDFIRE MEDICATION PLANS FILED BY UTILITIES. REVISITING INDIAN URGES ASIAN PROTOCOLS OF THE UTILITIES AND DEVELOPING THE FINANCIAL STRESS TEST MANDATED BY SB NINE A ONE WE FULLY INTEND TO MEET THE STATUTORY DIRECTIVE TO COMPLETE REVIEW OF THE WILD FOR MEDICATION PLANS BY THIS MAY. WE ARE WORKING ON THE RELATED RISK AND OTHER SAFETY PROCEEDINGS AND HELPED ORGANIZE A WILDFIRE TECH. SUMMIT LATER THIS MONTH WHICH YOU ARE ALL INVITED TO ATTEND. WHICH WILL BE FOCUSED ON NEW SOLUTIONS TO WILD FIRE MITIGATION. WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT WAYS TO EXPEDITE OUR PROCESSES ESPECIALLY TO HANDLE TIME SENSITIVE MATTER MATTERS. I HAVE BEEN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR ONE YEAR. AND I WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE NECESSARY CHANGES AT THE P. UC. WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL OF YOU [inaudible] AND ENSURING. THAT WE HANDLED THINGS APPROPRIATELY. QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY AND WITHOUT. I WILL TURN IT OVER TO OUR ECCLES WHO HAS SPECIFIC RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS THAT YOU ALL POSED. GOOD MORNING CHAIR HUESO AND HONORABLE MEMBERS -- I WANTED TO FIRST NEVER. TOUCH ON SOME -- KIND OF BANKRUPTCY NUANCES IN CHAPTER ELEVEN RELATED TO THIS PARTICULAR BANKRUPTCY SOME UPCOMING KEY. DATES AND TEACHINGS CHAPTER ELEVEN CASE AND A DISCUSSION OF OUR STANDING IN THE BANKRUPTCY CASE AND THEN I'LL MOVE ON TO QUESTIONS THAT SHE VAST -- YOU HEARD TESTIMONY THIS MORNING -- FROM PER. ON FEDERAL YES THAT. THIS IS VERY COMPLICATED BANKRUPTCY THIS IS NOT. WILK RELATION IT'S A CHAPTER ELEVEN REORGANIZATION. AND IT TOOK THREE YEARS FOR PGD TOGETHER BANKRUPTCY THE LAST TIME AND I WAS INVOLVED IN THE THE FIRST PGA BANKRUPTCY AND I CAN SHARE. MY RESPONSES SOME OF THE BENEFITS OF THAT EXPERIENCE. BUT BECAUSE IT'S A REGULATIVE THE REGULATED ENTITY -- I PRINCIPLE AREA OF CONCERN IS TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH P. JEANNIE AS A UTILITY. AS A DEBTOR IN POSSESSION IN THIS CHAPTER ELEVEN CASE ATTEMPTS TO AVOID COMPLIANCE WITH STATE LAW AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE HEARD ALREADY THIS MORNING THAT P. GINNY HAS TAKEN THE POSITION THAT IT DOESN'T NEED FOR APPROVAL. TO ABROGATE WHOLESALE POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENTS ONLY THE BANKRUPTCY APPROVAL AND I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT LATER ON IN MY COMMENTS. ACCORDINGLY AS A REGULATOR OF THE COMMISSION AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES. NEEDS TO NEED TO BE VIGILANT TO ENSURE THAT NOTHING CURVES. IN THIS CHAPTER ELEVEN CASE THAT CIRCUMVENT STATE LAW. AND ARE REGULATORY DUTIES AND AFFORDED IN TEACHING THESE CHAPTER. ELEVEN INCLUDE MARCH THIRTEENTH HEARING THE COMPANY WILL SEEK FINAL APPROVAL ON ITS DEBTOR IN FINANCE. THERE ARE IN POSSESSION FINANCING IT'S FIVE POINT FIVE BILLION -- THAT IT'S REQUESTING. AN AUTHORIZATION TO CONTINUE CUSTOMER PROGRAMS AND PAY OPERATIONAL INTEGRITY SUPPLIERS AMONG OTHER RELIEF. I'M ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED PRIOR TO FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY -- WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH PEACH YOU NEED TO IDENTIFY -- PROGRAMS THAT. ARE PART OF THE CPC AND THE STATE'S REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAT REALLY ARE NOT. HE JIMMY IS ACTING AS A FIDUCIARY ABOUT CIRCUMSTANCE IS A REALLY NOT THERE ARE. PROGRAMS IS NOT THERE ARE MANY -- AND WE WERE SUCCESSFUL WHAT GIVING PGT TO IDENTIFY THOSE AND TAKE THEM OFF THE TABLE. BECAUSE OTHERWISE THOSE COULD BE PUT AS COLLATERAL FOR THEIR DEBTOR IN POSSESSION FINANCING. APRIL TENTH -- THERE'S A HEARING ON P. DIDDY'S MOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AGAINST FOR EXERCISING JURISDICTION OVER THE P. PA'S AGAIN I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE MORE LATER. AND MAY TWENTY EIGHTH. IS CURRENTLY THE LAST EIGHT P. JEANNIE HAS THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO FILE CHAPTER ELEVEN PLAN. AM AT DATES IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIONS FOR UP TO AN ADDITIONAL FOURTEEN MONTHS. AND THAT'S THAT EXCLUSIVITY ABOUT THE PROFESSOR WAS TALKING ABOUT. AS TO THE CPUC STANDING IN BANKRUPTCY. AND ARE ANTICIPATED ROLE -- WE HAVE MULTIPLE ROLES IN THE CHAPTER ELEVEN CASE. AS A REGULATOR. WE CAN BE HEARD ON ANY MATTER THAT AFFECTS OUR REGULATORY. FORTY AND THIS IS SIGNIFICANT. AS ULTIMATELY AND A PLAN THAT THE BANKRUPTCY COURT CONFIRMS MUST BE FEASIBLE. AND THE SEAS CPUC SUPPORT FOR PLAN. INCLUDING THE PROPOSING OF ITS OWN PLAN IF NECESSARY IS CRITICAL FOR THE CONFIRMATION. PROCESS OF ANY FEASIBLE PLAN. THE COMMISSION ALSO HAS VARIOUS CLAIMS AGAINST P. JEANNIE. AS A CREDITOR PGD DOES OS MONEY. THROUGHOUT THE PROCEEDINGS THE CPUC ACTIVELY ENGAGES WITH P. JEANNIE TO ENSURE THAT ANTICIPATED ACTIONS IN THE CHAPTER ELEVEN CASE ARE CONSISTENT WITH STATE LAW. SO THAT UNNECESSARY LITIGATION CAN BE AVOIDED. AND ALREADY GAVE THEEXAMPLE THAT PRIOR TO FILING THEIR PETITION WE WORKED WITH THEM. TO AVOID LITIGATING OVER YOU KNOW PUBLIC PURPOSE PROGRAMS AND PAYMENTS OF NO COMMUNITY CHOICE ACT AGGREGATORS AND OTHER. PROGRAMS WHERE. PT DISS COLLECTING MONEY. AND PASSING THOSE LIVES ON IT BUT IT'S REALLY NOT THEIR OWN THEIR OWN ASSETS. WE ALSO ENGAGE REGULARLY WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES PARTICULARLY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. IN THE BANKRUPTCY REPRESENTS OTHER STATE AGENCIES AS CREDITORS IN THE BANKRUPTCY AND THEY'RE ALSO VERY MUCH -- TUNED IN TO ENFORCEMENT OF THE STATE'S STATUTORY FRAMEWORKS OF THOSE OTHER AGENCIES. AND SO WE COORDINATE WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE TAKE CONSISTENT POSITIONS TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE. ALSO -- FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES THAT A DEBTOR IN POSSESSION OPERATING COMPLIANCE WITH STATE LAW YOU'VE HEARD THAT A READY [inaudible] AND THE BANKRUPTCY CODE ALSO PROVIDED ANY RATE CHANGE UNDER CHAPTER ELEVEN PLAN MUST BE APPROVED BY THE RELEVANT REGULATORY BODY. SO IF THERE ARE ANY RATE INCREASES OR ANYTHING THAT AFFECTS RATES. THERE HAS TO BE APPROVAL BY THE KEYS SEE. SO IN TERMS OF OUR PROCESS FOR REVIEW OF A REORGANIZATION PLAN INCLUDING REVIEW OF COST RECOVERY. IN MOST CASES THE DEBTOR IN THIS CASE P. JEANNIE [inaudible] FORMULATES PROPOSES -- ITS OWN PLAN OF REORGANIZATION. OTHER PARTIES HOWEVER MAY PROPOSE A CHAPTER ELEVEN PLAN IF THE DEBTORS EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO FILE PLAN HAS EXPIRED. OR THERE'S A STALEMATE IN THE PLANT CLOSE ASIANS. AND IN CHAPTER PIGEONS FIRST CHAPTER ELEVEN CASE WE ACTUALLY PROPOSED OUR OWN. COMPETING CHAPTER ELEVEN PLAN OF REORGANIZATION. IN MATT -- FIRST [inaudible] BANKRUPTCY -- WE DETERMINED THAT THE COMPANY'S PLAN WAS CONTRARY TO STATE LAW. AND POLICY AND IN THAT CASE PETER NEIGHBORS DURING WHAT WE CALL THAT A REGULATORY JAILBREAK. THEY'RE TRYING TO GET OUT FROM UNDER SI PC JURISDICTION. AND SPIN OFF EVERY. PART OF THEIR ORGANIZATION EXCEPT DISTRIBUTION. TO THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION. AND SO. WHAT ENDED UP HAPPENING IS WE ACTUALLY LITIGATED BOTH POINT SINCE IN BANKRUPTCY COURT? WE HAD HEARINGS IN THE BANKRUPTCY COURT. AND THERE WAS. BUT HEARINGS LASTED PROBABLY TWO TO THREE MONTHS. AND THE JUDGE. ORDER ALL OF US TO GO ON TO SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS. BECAUSE IT WAS CLEAR THEY WERE SO MANY. IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT NEEDED TO BE RESOLVED IN BANKRUPTCY COURT DOES LIKE SETTLEMENTS TO THE EXTENT THAT CAN -- BE REACHED BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND ULTIMATELY WE DID REACH A SETTLEMENT. WITH A PROPOSED PLAN -- WHERE WHICH KEPT -- PTV REGULATED UNDER SI PC JURISDICTION. AND ALSO -- RESOLVED ALL OF THE FINANCIAL ISSUES. AND THE BANKRUPTCY CASE -- AND SO WE HAD OUR OWN PROCESS WITH YOU SEE WE HAVE A BANKRUPTCY -- I ALL I THAT WE OPENED. AND IN THAT CASE. WE HAD THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT -- THAT'D FOR COMMENTS FROM ALL PARTIES. AND ULTIMATELY THE COMMISSION APPROVED. A MODIFIED SOLOMON PLAN WHICH REQUIRED P. JEANNIE TO AGREE TO THE CHANGES THAT THE COMMISSION IMPOSED ON ITS APPROVAL. AND ONCE THAT WAS DONE -- THAT MODIFIED SETTLEMENT PLAN WAS FILED IN THE BANKRUPTCY COURT AS THE TOP PLAN OF ORGANIZATION AND WAS ULTIMATELY. APPROVED [inaudible] BY. THE BANKRUPTCY COURT AND THERE WERE APPEALED SINCE AND WE ALSO WERE INVOLVED IN -- SUPPORTING THE PLAN APPEAL. SO PETER IS NOT YET FILED ITS PLAN OF REORGANIZATION -- SO IT'S PREMATURE TO SPECULATE WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO FILE OUR OWN PLAN -- REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT P. JEANNIE DOES -- BUT I THINK. P. GINNY'S HAS REPRESENTED TO US THAT THEY ARE GOING TO TRY TO GET PARTY'S ONBOARD. PRIOR TO FILING A PLAN OF ORGANIZATION. SO A BANKRUPTCY COURT WILL RESOLVE ALL PRE PETITION. BANKRUPTCY CLAIMS INCLUDING THE WILDFIRE LIABILITY CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES. THAT EXISTED PRIOR TO P. GINNY FILING [inaudible] FOR BANKRUPTCY [inaudible] AND AGAIN. ALRIGHT MAKING TREATMENT. IS HANDLED BY THE CPUC BANKRUPTCY COURT DOES NOT ENGAGE IN RATE MAKING -- SO ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT -- THE MEMBERS HAD WAS WHETHER THE CPR KEY IF YOU SEE CAN SPEAK GENERALLY ABOUT THE TUG OF WAR. RELATED TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE PPA IS. THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS FIGHT GOING ON BETWEEN -- YOU TO NAY AND FOR KIDS AND PUBLICLY. PJ HAS STATED THAT IT'S MADE NO DECISION TO REJECT ANY PPH BUT IT'S JUST PREEMPTIVELY SUED SURE THAT THEY HAVE THAT OPTION IN BANKRUPTCY. COURT -- SO CURRENTLY THE PPA COUNTERPARTIES OR TRYING TO TAKE THAT. LAWSUIT. COLIN ADVERSARY PROCEEDING OUT OF BANKRUPTCY COURT TO DISTRICT COURT. AND JUDGE BROWN TELL A JUST RECENTLY ISSUED A RECOMMENDATION TO THE DISTRICT COURT. ASKING THAT HE BE ABLE TO KEEP IT AND RESOLVE THOSE QUESTIONS HIMSELF. I AM YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD TESTIMONY AND I AGREE THAT. THE CASE LAW ABOUT WHO HAS JURISDICTION HERE AS BETWEEN THE BANKRUPTCY COURT [inaudible] AND FOR IF THERE'S INCONSISTENT PRESIDENT AND THERE'S NO BINDING AUTHORITY RIGHT NOW ON THE NIGHT CIRCUIT ON THIS ISSUE. BUT WHAT I THINK HAS NOT BEEN BROUGHT. OPT SO FAR [inaudible] IS THAT. THE CPUC ALSO HAS. REGULATORY FOR THE FORTY OVER THE PPA IS NOT JUST. FOR AND THE PPA IS ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE CPC'S IMPLEMENTATION IN COMPLIANCE WITH CALIFORNIA'S STATUTORY GOALS. POST ENERGY CRISIS FOR CLEAN ENERGY RELIABILITY AND CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AGAINST MARKET POWER. PARTIES TO THESE CONTRACTS NEED TO BE ABLE TO RELY UPON THE CONTRACTS THAT HAVE BEEN ENTERED INTO. AFTER COMPLYING WITH THE STATE'S REGULATORY PROCUREMENT PROCESS. AND AFTER RELYING ON THOSE CONTRACTS TO OBTAIN FINANCING FOR THIS PROJECTS. AND THE CPUC HAS JURISDICTION OVER THESE CONTRACTS AND THEY CANNOT BE ABROGATED IN BANKRUPTCY WITHOUT OUR APPROVAL. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE ABROGATION OF SUCH CONTRACTS ARE NESS -- WOULD NOT ONLY INTERFERE WITH THE CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN ENERGY COLDS. BUT THAT THESE CONTRACTS ARE NECESSARY FOR THE SAFETY AND RELIABILITY OF THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM. AND MOREOVER ABROGATION WOULD UNDERMINE REGULATORY CERTAINTY NEEDED FOR THE CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA'S ONGOING EFFORTS TO GROW INTO CARBON LINES IT'S ECONOMY. AND ONE THING I WOULD ADD. THESE CONTRACTS ARE NOT LIKE A CONTRACT FOR WIDGETS CONTRACT FOR SUPPLIES THAT A CREDITOR -- YOU KNOW IS FILING FOR TO RECEIVE RECOVERING BANKRUPTCY. THESE GO TO THE RELIABILITY OF OUR WHOLE ELECTRIC SYSTEM AND OUR OUR CLEAN ENERGY GOALS -- SO -- I DO HAVE OTHER RESPONSES BUT THIS FOR I THOUGHT I WOULD TAKE A PAUSE AND SEE. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR FOR HOW MANY JUST. WANTED A JUST A UNDERSTAND -- ARE YOU CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN THE NEGOTIATIONS OR IN WHATEVER PROCESS IS UNFOLDING NOW ARE YOU PRIVY TO WHAT IS HAPPENING INTERNALLY. YES WE HAVE -- PAUL WEISS -- WHO'S OUR BANKRUPTCY COUNSEL. AND DID ALSO REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE FIRST BANKRUPTCY. AND THEY ARE. EXTREMELY EXPERIENCE -- WELL RESPECTED BANKRUPTCY FIRM. AND ALSO BECAUSE THEY REPRESENTATIVES THE FIRST BANKRUPTCY -- AND THEY'RE THE ONES WHO SHEPHERDED THE ARKHAM. COMPETING PLAN FIRST BANKRUPTCY -- YEAH. WE'VE HAD THIS. ALMOST TWENTY YEAR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM THEY ALSO. OR BOND COUNSEL FOR THE SECURITIZATION SAID HAPPENED AFTER -- IN BANKRUPTCY. ALLEN THE HELPED US WITH THE EXIT FINANCING FOR TEACHING OUT OF BANKRUPTCY. THEY'VE ALSO BEEN OUR BOND COUNSEL FOR THE D. W. CONTRACTS. WE ALSO HAVE DO SERRA PARTNERS WHO AS OUR FINANCIAL ADVISER. AND PAUL WEISS TO SERRA IS WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE COMMISSION. ALLEN'S -- AND THEY'RE WORKING VERY. AND YOU KNOW ALL THE OTHER PARTIES SO WE'RE VERY ACTIVE AND WE PLAN TO BE -- ACTIVE -- BECAUSE THERE ARE TOO MANY IMPORTANT [inaudible] ON GOALS THAT -- IN ISSUES RELATED TO NOT ONLY OUR OWN JURISDICTION BUT OUR IMPLEMENTATION. STATE LAW -- AND WHATEVER. AS YOU'RE INVOLVED. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE BASICALLY IF. THERE IS A AN UNDERSTANDING OR SETTLEMENT THAT IS REACHED THROUGH THESE NEGOTIATION PROCESS. YOUR GONNA BRING THAT. PROPOSED THAT TO THE COMMISSION. AS A BODY FOR APPROVAL SO IT'LL BE YOUR RECOMMENDATION TO THE COMMISSION. WHATEVER IT IS THAT NEGOTIATED IT'LL BE A COUPLE OF THE NORMAL CLASS A JUDICIAL PROCESS. YES AND IT WAS EARLY THE COMMISSIONERS AND OUR PARTY TO THESE NEGOTIATED SINCE THIS IS ALL WITHIN STE THE STAFF LEVEL I'M. WE DO HAVE. ONGOING COMMUNICATIONS WITH WEB COMMISSIONERS BECAUSE THEY ARE CLIENT BUT THERE ARE NO NEGOTIATIONS PER SE. YET I MEAN THIS IS VERY PRELIMINARY RIGHT NOW. BUT IN THE FIRST BANKRUPTCY IT WAS A STAFF PROPOSAL. ABOUT WAS REACHED AND THEN THE COMMISSIONERS -- HOW -- TO IF YOU ARE PROCESS THE BANKRUPTCY ARE I AM. WITH THE RECORD AND PARTIES PARTICIPATING. AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY INTERCHANGE THAT PROPOSAL ONE BUT AND VOTED ON IT AND AGAIN THEY DID HAVE SOME MODIFICATIONS. TO THE ORIGINAL -- SETTLEMENT PROPOSAL. WHICH PAGING ELSEWHERE GREED TO THOSE CHANGES. YOU CAN ONLY AGREED. TO TO WHAT'S IN THE POWER OF THE COMMISSION LEGISLATIVE. EITHER OBSTACLE OR THERE COULD BE AN LEGISLATIVE FIX. DO YOU SEE YOURSELVES POTENTIALLY IS A PARTY TO PRESENT THAT TO THE LEGISLATURE TO SEEK. LEGISLATIVE ASSISTANCE THROUGH THIS PROCESS [inaudible] IT'S THERE ARE SO MANY ISSUES INVOLVED IN THIS BANKRUPTCY. AT YOU KNOW ARE NOT. JUST PC RELATED. CHARGER STICTION THAT INVOLVE BIG POLICY PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES. AND THAT WE THINK THE ONLY. WAY SHE'S GOING TO GET OUT OF BANKRUPTCIES GET INVOLVED. A SETTLEMENT THAT INVOLVES GOVERNOR'S. OFFICE AND THE LEGISLATURE. AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING ON THESE ARE VERY IMPORTANT. PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES AND GO TO THE HEARTS OF STATE LAW. AND WHEN WE ARE I MEAN I THINK GENERALLY WERE WERE IN AN ATMOSPHERE [inaudible] WHERE? WE'RE BEGINNING TO ASSESS LIABILITIES DIFFERENTLY. AND AND THE WAY WE OPERATE OUR UTILITY NOW I THINK IS GOING TO CHANGE GOING INTO THE FUTURE THAT IS TO SIMPLY WHAT I MY EXPECTATION -- WHETHER YOU SHARE THAT EXPECTATION OF HOW HOW WOULD YOU. I MEAN. WE HAVE BEEN CREATED IN REQUIREMENTS REGULATORY CONTROLS OR UTILITIES THAT. OFTEN HAVE A COST ON RATE PAYERS. OF OFTEN THOSE ARE VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAMS. BUT GIVEN. GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE THREAT. OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND THESE WILD FIRES AND FLOODS AND HIGH WINDS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE FUTURE. DO YOU DO YOU EXPECT THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE PRIORITIZING -- THE THE SAFETY ELEMENT OVER. OTHER PROGRAMS THAT WE'VE HAD -- THAT CAN BE COSTLY ANY WHAT I'M ASKING IS ARE WE GONNA WAY. OUR PRIORITIES TO MINIMIZE THE THE INCREASE OF RATES BECAUSE MY MY FEAR IS THAT WE'RE JUST GONNA TOP. YOU KNOW PILE ON RATE INCREASES ON TOP OF OUR CURRENT PROGRAMS AND SAY OKAY NOW WE FIX THIS PROBLEM AND NOT REALLY OF VALUE WAY. HOW WE -- HOW WE REGULATE DIGIT UTILITIES AND HOW WE TRY? TO YOU KNOW -- BALANCE. YOU KNOW THE THE THE COSTS TO RATEPAYERS OF OF I WANT TO MAKE SOME INITIAL RESPONSE AND AND LET -- DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF RANDOLPH ALSO RESPOND -- SO. JUST RAISING RATES IS NOT COULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM HERE -- AND I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO GET PGP OUT OF BANKRUPTCY. WE'RE DEALING HERE WITH. YOU KNOW THESE ISSUES OF SAFETY WILDFIRE LIABILITY. YOU KNOW CLIMATE CHANGE AND HOW THAT'S IMPACTING. CATASTROPHIC LIABILITY AND I THINK THE STATE HAS TO COME UP WITH SOME. OVER ARCHING GLOBAL SOLUTION TO THIS AND AND I WOULD ALSO VENTURE TO SAY. THAT. UTILITIES AND RATEPAYERS SHOULD NOT BE MADE -- THE INSURER OF LAST RESORT. BECAUSE THAT IS NOT SUSTAINABLE. SEVERAL THE STATE ROAD IS TO GRAPPLE WITH THESE ISSUES AND COME UP WITH. SOME KIND OF GLOBAL SOLUTION AND I'D LIKE. TO PASS THE BATON HERE THANK YOU -- EVERGRANDE OFF -- YEAH I THINK YOU RAISE A VERY GOOD QUESTION YOU KNOW AS WE LOOK AT THE CALENDAR THE CIRCUMSTANCES HERE ON ON THE COST AND WHO PAYS FOR THOSE. I'M IN THE CHALLENGES NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE -- THE WILD FOR LIABILITY COST ON YOU HAVE THE THE COST OF THE MEDICATION PLANS -- YOU KNOW YOU'RE TO STACK IN THERE AS WELL WE HAVE THE FIGHT THE COST OF THE WILD FIRES IT OF ARE YOU KURD. YOU HAVE THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY ACOSTA WILD FIRES IN THE FUTURE. I'M INSIDE YOU START THE STACK ALL THOSE UP AND FOR SOME STATUTORY REQUIRED REPORTS THAT ARE DUE OUT IN APRIL -- TO HOPEFULLY PROVIDE A LOT MORE CLARITY -- AROUND HOW ALL OF THOSE COSTS COULD STACK UP -- BUT YOU DO GET TO A POINT WHERE YOU CAN SEE WHERE. ON BILLS AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE IMPORTANT THING IS A FOCUS ON BILLS NOT RATES WHAT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT OF WHAT THEIR TOTAL BILL IS. ON START TO BECOME ON AFFORDABLE -- pWE PRIORITIZE BOTH WITHIN ANY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IN A BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING BUT THEN ALSO WITH IN TOTALITY OF OF WHAT'S GONNA NEED TO HAPPEN OUTSIDE OF THE BANKRUPTCY AGREEMENT. AND THE FINAL THING THE PLANET FOR THE RECORD ORGANIZATION PLAN YOU MENTIONED THERE'S A STATUTORY DEADLINE IN MAY. OR IS THAT SOMETHING WAS A MARCHER [inaudible] MICHAEL. I'M SORRY. OF MAY TWENTY EIGHTH IS CURRENTLY THE LAST DAY THAT PEACHY HAS THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT. TO FILE CHAPTER ELEVEN PLAN. ALTHOUGH THEY COULD HAVE THAT EXTENDED UP TO FOURTEEN MONTHS. AND AND AS YOU'VE HEARD ALREADY THEY HAVE ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS. TO GET OUT OF BANKRUPTCY BUT THAT ALSO COULD BE. EXTENDED YOU MENTIONED THAT MADE A STATEMENT THAT THEY WILL FILE IT UNTIL THEY HAVE SOMEWHAT OF A UNDERSTANDING WITH YOU. WELL THAT'S NOT EXACTLY. THAT THEY'VE SAID THAT THERE ARE GOING TO WORK OUT. YOU KNOW SOME AGREEMENT BETWEEN PARTIES PRIOR TO FILING IT. BECAUSE IT'S NOT GONNA DO ANY GOOD IF THEY FILE SOMETHING THAT'S DEAD ON ARRIVAL ON ON DAY ONE SO. WE SHOULD ASSUME IF THEY FILE IT. THAT THERE'S AN AGREEMENT. WELL NOT NECESSARILY I MEAN THEY THERE COULD BE AGREEMENT ON PART PART OF A FRAMEWORK AND DISAGREEMENT ABOUT. OTHER ASPECTS OF IT. I REALLY CAN'T SPECULATE OKAY -- WE'RE GONNA GO TO IS -- CENTER MORE LOCKED AND SERVE GOD. BILL -- AND JUST A REMINDER THAT MISTER RANDOLPH ALSO HAD SOME ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. OR CAN I THINK WE'VE COVERED. OKAY WE'LL GO TO QUESTIONS -- I'VE BEEN REMINDED -- TO MAYBE YOU'RE GONNA COMMENT ON THIS AND I WANT TO CUT YOU OFF BUT IF YOU'RE GONNA COMMENT ON SERVICE I GUESS. THE BIGGEST QUESTION IS HOW WILL THIS AFFECT SERVICE WILL PEOPLE BE CUT OFF WILL. WILL THAT CHANGE THE POLICY IN TERMS OF HOW SERVICES ARE DELIVERED YAH I'M I'M HAPPY TO GO INTO THAT SO -- YOU KNOW IT IN THE FEW WEEKS BEFORE P. JEANNIE WAS IN BANKRUPTCY THERE WAS SOME CONCERN ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICE TO I DO SOME CASH FOR PROBLEMS THEY'VE HAD. NOW THAT THERE IN BANKRUPTCY AND THEY HAVE ACCESS TO ON FINANCING -- THERE IS NOT. THERE THERE'S VERY LITTLE CONCERN ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICE BOTH BECAUSE THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THE FINANCING THEY NEED. TO BUY AND SELL ON THE ELECT -- ELECTRICITY NATURAL GAS IN THE N. B. -- TO COMPLY WITH STATE -- LAWS AND REGULATIONS ON SO AZAR BANKRUPTCY WE DO ANTICIPATE THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO BUY AND SELL ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS. ON THAT THEY'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO SPEND THE MONEY NECESSARY ON WILD FOR MEDICATION AND OTHER SEPT SAFETY MEASURES THAT THEY'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO FUND PUBLIC PURPOSE PROGRAMS. AND THE CLEAN ENERGY PROGRAM SUCH AS CARE THE LOW INCOME ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS ENERGY EFFICIENCY -- AND RENEWABLE ENERGY AND STORAGE REBATE PROGRAMS -- YEP ALSO IMPORTANTLY ON AND I THINK IF THEY'RE CLEESE MENTION IS A LITTLE BIT AS P. JEANNIE WAS GOING INTO BANKRUPTCY -- WE WORK TO ENSURE THAT ON FUNDS THAT ARE SET ASIDE FOR REPAIR PER -- OP PROGRAMS REPAIR PURPOSES ON CANNOT BE USED AS COLLATERAL AGAINST THESE LINES ARE SO FOR EXAMPLE I'M IN THIS IS -- AN ILLUSTRATIVE LET'S NOT THE TOTAL US BUT FOR EXAMPLE TRUST FUND SET ASIDE FOR ON NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING. THOSE CANNOT BE USE FOR COLLATERAL AGAINST THE LOAN THOSE ARE SAFE TRUST FUNDS -- FUNDS COLLECTED SUPPORT -- PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY AUTHORIZE FOR LEGISLATION OR CBC MANDATE SO FOR EXAMPLE ON THE UTILITIES WILL OVER COLLECTED EARLY YEAR SOME PROGRAMS LIKE THE STUFF GENERATION INCENTIVE PROGRAM. ON AND THOSE PROGRAMS DAY SET ASIDE FOR THAT -- LANDS THAT HAVE BEEN -- SET ASIDE ON THE PART ELEMENT EASEMENTS THOSE CONTINUE TO BE PROTECTED. THERE HAVE BEEN IT'S WORTH NOTING SOME HICK UPS EARLY ON IN BANKRUPTCY -- THAT WE'VE HAD TO WORK WITH P. GINNY TO RESOLVE -- P. GENIES INSTITUTED A NEW SYSTEM OF REVIEWING INVOICES -- WHICH I THINK CAN BE A LITTLE CUMBERSOME -- AND SO WE'VE HAD TO WORK WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE THE CRITICAL VENDORS ARE PAID ON TIME THAT THIS PROCESS OF REVIEWING THE INVOICES DOESN'T SLOW DOWN. ON THOSE PAYMENTS -- OUT THERE -- WE'VE ALSO HAD A PROBLEM WITH -- SOME STANDARD FORM CONTRACTS THAT EXIST FOR SMALL RENEWABLE PROGRAMS -- RIGHT NOW THAT REALLY IMPACTS AND SMALL RENEWABLE BIOMASS GENERATORS -- THE STANDARD FORM CONTRACTS HAVE A PROVISION IN THEM THAT -- REQUIRE THE UTILITY TO CERTIFY THAT THEIR FINANCIALLY SOLVENT -- OBVIOUSLY THE UTILITY CAN'T CERTIFY RIGHT THROUGH THE PROCESS AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN TO HAVE THOSE TERMS REMOVED FROM THAT CONTRACTS AT THOSE CONTRACTS CAN BE EXECUTED. I'M I ANTICIPATED TO BE MORE ONE OFF PROBLEMS LIKE THIS ALONG THE WAY -- AND YOU KNOW WE'RE SETTING UP TO DEAL WITH THOSE -- PROBLEMS -- YOU KNOW THE REST OF THE STATEMENTS -- I HAD WERE LOOKING AT THE LONG TERM -- IMPACTS HERE ON I THINK. WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THE LONG TERM IMPACTS IS THE PC IS NOT GONNA APPROVE A PLAN. ON THAT'S NOT GONNA MAINTAIN UTILITIES -- OBLIGATION TO MEET THE STATE'S CLEAN ENERGY GOALS DOES NOT PROVIDE CALIFORNIA WITH A RELIABLE RELIABLE AND I THINK CRITICALLY AFFORDABLE ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS. I'M IN WE'VE ADDED SOME STATEMENTS YOU'RE ABOUT THE PPA IT'S BUT I THINK WE'VE COME. IF YOU IF YOU'RE -- I GO ARTS ENSURE THERE THE FIRST TIME CAN I GO OVER SOME HISTORY BECAUSE I WAS THERE -- TO AND I HAD SOME FUN AN ORANGE COUNTY AT THE TIME WITH THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON. ACTUALLY BECAME THE CHAIR OF THE CREDITORS COMMITTEE SO. IT'S LIKE DEJA VU HERE -- SAY YOU'RE SAYING WE'RE NOT GETTING OLDER WE'RE GETTING BETTER YEAH WELL HOPEFULLY WE LEARN THINGS -- SO HELP ME OUT AT THE TIME -- THE UTILITIES WERE NOT ALLOWED TO BUY FUTURES CONTRACTS THEY HAD TO BUY ON THE SPOT MARKET IN THE SPOT MARKET START SPIKED AND SO THE CAR GOT TO BE. JUST ENORMOUS IN IT AT THE TIME STATE TREASURER PHIL ANGELIDES WAS THEN ISSUING THAT. TO HELP PAY FOR THESE CONTRACTS. AND IN COULD YOU REFRESH ME ON WHOSE DEATH WAS IT WAS IT ON THE STATE [inaudible] BOOKS OR WAS IT ON HE GENIES BOOKS [inaudible] WELL. THIS IS PART OF THE ENERGY CRISIS HISTORY AND ON THE STATE HAD TO STEP I TO PURCHASE ELECTRICITY ON BEHALF OF IN OPERATE PAIRS AND SO THEY DID. YEAH ISSUE BONDS INTO TO RAISE MONEY TO DO THAT MEASURE THE D. W. OR ARE BONDS THAT -- WE'VE REFINANCE MANY TIMES NOW IT'S INTEREST RATES HAVE GONE DOWN [inaudible] BET. WHEN P. GINNY WAS IN BANKRUPTCY P. GINNY WAS NO LONGER PURCHASING POWER FOR THE UTILITIES [inaudible] ELECTRIC POWER. SO WHO WHO'S BEEN PAYING THE W. R. BONDS -- WE HAVE. WE REPAIRS RATEPAYERS THERE IS -- IT'S BUILT INTO THE P. JEANNIE RATE TODAY. AND SO IT MOVED IN FROM THE STATE'S BOOKS TO THE P. JEANNIE BUT SAY ASSUMED ALL THE DAT. THERE'S A MAJOR ARM. ACTION NOT SURE I THINK IT'S ON THE TO BE OURS BOX STILL ON BUT THERE'S A PROCESS IN WHICH EVERY YEAR D. W. R. PROVIDES THE P. YOU SEE WITH A STATEMENT OF WHAT IT'S GOING TO COST TO PAY. THOSE COSTS FOR THAT YEAR ON THE NAY SHOW UP ACTUALLY AS A LINE ITEM ON THE UTILITY BILL RIGHT NOW -- IN THOSE BONDS WILL NOT BE OF THOSE COSTS WILL NOT BE PAID OFF IN FULL UNTIL. TWENTY TWENTY THREE WITH TWO OF RESIDUE YES. I'M. SO MY CONCERN IS THAT -- WELL MAYBE THE FIRST QUESTION WOULD BE. WHO WHO ESTABLISHED A POLICY OF AB ACQUIRING? ELECTRICITY AND GAS ON THE SPOT MARKET WHAT WAS THAT AS SEAT CPUC REGULATION OR WAS. AB. EIGHTEEN NINETY SOME OF YOU REMEMBER THAT. RIGHT SO THAT WAS THE DE REGULATION -- AB EIGHTEEN NINETY WAS PART OF ELECTRIC RESTRUCTURING AND SET UP THE CREATION. AND THE POWER EXCHANGE. SO THEN THE STATE SORT OF FOR HELP CREATE THE AND THAT. WELL WE'RE KIND OF INFERRING. I THINK THAT MAY BE A SUBJECT FOR ANOTHER DAY YEAH A LONG HEARING A LOT OF HISTORY. YEAH BUT THEN LET ME. LET ME. MAYBE FOCUS ON WHY I'M ASKING BECAUSE I'VE BEEN WORKING ON TRYING TO PREVENT WILDFIRES. LEGISLATION. AND IT HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN IN A IN MY RESEARCH SHOWS THAT. THE CPUC AND CAL FIRE TAKEN TEN YEARS. TO BUILD NOT GET BUYER MAPS DONE -- AND I'VE GOT COMMUNITIES THAT ARE AT RISK THAT. SHOULD BE UNDER GROUNDINGOR DOING SOMETHING TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AND SO I I SINCE MY EFFORTS YOU WE'VE HAD. HUNDRED TWENTY PEOPLE DIE AND WONDERFUL COMMUNITY SO I'M I'M REALLY GETTING OLD CONCERNED BECAUSE THE CPUC ISN'T DURING THE FIRE MAPS IN A TIMELY MANNER. AND WE ARE TRYING TO ELECTRIFY THIS STATE. WE'RE TRYING TO GET. COMPANIES TO HAVE. ELECTRIC POWERED TRUCKS WHICH TAKE HOURS TO RECHARGE RATE AND SO MUCH ENERGY WE GOT TO MOVE ALL THIS STUFF AROUND STATE. AND I'M JUST WONDERING. WHERE IS THE LEADERSHIP FROM THE CPU SITA TO ADDRESS THESE CRITICAL ISSUES WHERE WE'VE BEEN? AND WOULD WE HAVE EXPOSURE AS A DEEP POCKET TO BE DRAWN INTO. THIS [inaudible] CHAPTER [inaudible] ELEVEN FILE. BUT A LOT OF QUESTIONS IN ONE MAYBE. YES I KNOW OUR SINCE YOU'VE BEEN THERE AND I CAN I THINK YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET AT I THANK GOD ON THE THE TIMING OF THE WITH THE THE WILD FOR MAXIMUM BEGINNING ONE OF THE THREE OF US ARE IN THE BEST POSITION TO ANSWER THAT. QUESTION. ON THE ON THE QUESTION OF THE DEEP POCKETS OF THIS IF THE STATE CAN BE BROUGHT INTO IT NOT NOT MUST THE STATE WANTS TO GET BROUGHT INTO IT -- YOU KNOW AS FAR AS THE P. GINNY BANKRUPTCY. NOW AS FAR AS BROADER. WILDFIRE LITIGATION I THINK THAT'S A QUESTION. FOR A DIFFERENT AGENCY. SO THEN THE STATE. BACK IN -- TWO WAS BROUGHT INTO IT. AS MAYBE A AN AGENT FOR THE UTILITIES TO TO TO BORROW MONEY TO PAY FOR THAT. ELECTRICITY TO GIVE TO THE TO THE REPAIRS BY HAVING TO PAY A MASSIVE INCREASE IN RATES AND THEN IT WAS. AMORTIZED OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME AND SO THAT'S THAT'S BEEN RESOLVED BUT IT WAS A BIG. WE ALWAYS MEMBERS ARE COMING BACK MYSTICAL OR I MEAN I I GRAY DAVIS TOOK A PROBLEM TURN IT INTO A MESS. ANY GOT RECALLED OVER I BELIEVE IT WAS ONE OF THE MAJOR FACTORS OF WHY HE WAS RECALLED SO THIS IS. VERY SERIOUS THIS WHOLE P. JEANNIE AND HERE WE AREAGAIN AND I'M JUST. I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WERE HERE. WE WE'VE LEARNED FROM TWENTY YEARS. INCOME FOR EVERYBODY ALL ALL THE SAME. SO THOSE ARE MY CONCERNS MISTER CURRENT THANK YOU FOR AT LEAST. VETTING BECAUSE IT WAS AN INTERESTING TIME AND AND I HAD FUND DEALING WITH SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON IN. THERE SEE ABOUT THE TIME IS TED CRAVER AND THEN HE'S GAME THE C. E. O. LATER AND WE JUST HAD A LOT OF INTERESTING. NOT LIKE JERRY HILL VERSUS BG ANYWAY. WELL I HOPE THAT THAT. THE EXPERIENCE SERVICES WELL THIS. ONE I WILL GO TO CENTER DOT. YEAH I THINK THIS CENTER HILL CENTER STERN SO THIS IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BANKRUPTCY THAN THAN WHAT THAT WAS I DON'T THINK THE UNDERLYING FACTORS. OF THIS BANKRUPTCY PUTS US AT ANY RISK OF HAVING. YOUR THIS RATE -- WELL. POWER COST -- YOUR BIG POWER POP COST PROBLEMS I THINK WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS ALL RIGHT I'LL BE QUICK -- ONE YOU SAID EARLIER THAT -- CPUC WOULD HAVE. TO APPROVE ANY RATE INCREASES AND I'M WATER IF THAT ALSO APPLIES TO WEAR AND ONE OF THE UTILITIES -- IS DOWNGRADED TO LIFE'S A JUNK BOND STATUS. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE MAY NOT BE CORRECTED THOSE ARE BY STATUTE PASSED THROUGH -- RATE INCREASES AND LIKE A RATE INCREASE -- FOR PROGRAMS THAT THEY HAVE AND THEY WANT TO FILE AT A RATE INCREASE TO FOLLOW QUESTION. I'M. I WOULD SAY THE IN THE FIRST INSTANCE THAT [inaudible] YOU. WE WANT OUR UTILITIES TO BE INVESTMENT GRADE WE DON'T WANT HIM TO BE DOWNGRADED. BUT ONE OF THE IMPACTS OF A DOWNGRADE THIS IT MAKES THE COST OF CAPITAL MORE EXPENSIVE. TO BORROW -- SO THAT JUST MEANS THAT. THOSE COSTS. TO RATEPAYERS ARE HIGHER THE BORING BECAUSE ACTUALLY SO THAT'S AN AUTOMATIC PASSED THROUGH IS THAT WHAT WHAT I'M TRYING TO WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET AT IS IS. EVEN DURING BANKRUPTCY WHILE THIS IS ALL GOING ON THE THE ENTITY HAS TO CONTINUE TO RUN. AND THE COSTS ARE CLEARLY GOING UP. WHAT I'M ASKING IS IS ARE THOSE RATES? C. P. YOU SEE HERE IS THAT -- AND BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT. IF IN A GENERAL SENSE IF THE UTILITIES BARRING COST GOES UP -- YEAH THE P. YOU SEE IN SOME PROCESS AND ADD IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE -- A PRECEDING THAT HAPPENS EVERY SEVERAL YEARS THAT WE'RE GONNA OPEN ONE THIS YEAR IT'S TEED UP TO DETERMINE WHAT THE COST TO CAPITAL IT -- IN AND THEY'RE ALLOWED TO RECOVER THAT COST OF CAPITAL AS WE DETERMINE THAT. A MEAT IS THEORETICAL THAT WE COULD SIT THERE AND SAY WE ARE GOING ALLOW YOU TO RECOVER THE TOTAL COST OF CAPITAL BUT THEN IF THEY CAN'T RECOVER IT THEY ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO BORROW AND ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICE. EXACTLY THEN IT'S NOT ONLY THE COST OF CAPITAL IT'S ALSO THE COST OF CONTRACTS FOR LIKE WE NEW BULLS WHERE DID SWER. AND SOME OF THOSE THINGS AND SO YEAH I JUST THINK IT'S FAIR TO HAVE THAT. UNDERSTANDING THAT. DURING THIS PROCESS AND ALSO WHAT'S GOING ON IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WITH OUR INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES THERE. THAT THAT'S GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT THE ON REPAIRS NOBODY WANTS TO SAY IT BUT I'D YOU KNOW THE REALITY IS IS -- YEAH WITH OR WITHOUT INTERVENTION THERE ARE IMPACTS -- TO OUR RATE PAYERS AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED. TO PAY ATTENTION TO ONE FINAL QUESTION IS LAST WEEK P. JEANNIE ISSUED A STATEMENT THAT NOT WITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT THE COMPANY ENTERED CHAPTER. ELEVEN BANKRUPTCY REORGANIZATION. THE COMPANY WAS NOW QUESTIONING WHETHER CAN CONTINUE AS AN ONGOING CONCERN -- THAT ALMOST SOUNDS LIKE A REVERSE YVONNE MUST STATEMENT. AND I'M JUST LIKE WONDERING IF THAT COST -- ANY CONCERN OR WHAT WHAT THAT WAS ALL ABOUT MY MY UNDERSTANDING OF OF THAT SOUNDS A LOT MORE ALARMING THAN MAYBE. IT IS -- THAT HAD TO DO WITH. AN AUDIT VETS THEIR FINANCIAL AUDIT AND STATEMENT SAID A FINANCIAL. AUDITOR CAN MAKE AND SO IF YOU'RE AUDITING THE FINANCES OF A COMPANY WHOSE IN BANKRUPTCY. AS AN AUDITOR YU CAT CERTIFY THAT THEY MAKE THAT CERTIFICATION. ABOUT THEM CONTINUE AS AN ONGOING CONCERN. IT'S THE KIND OF THING WHERE THE AUDITOR DIDN'T HAVE ANY OTHER OP. ANY OTHER CHOICE BUT TO MAKE THAT STATEMENT BECAUSE PIGEONS IN BANKRUPTCY. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT I DIDN'T GET THAT DISTINCTION THAT. YOU WOULDN'T GET IT FROM THE NEWSPAPER [inaudible] YEAH. SENATOR HILL THANK YOU TO CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND AND ENGAGED IN THIS DISCUSSION OF TWO QUICK QUESTIONS IN IMPEACHING A P. GENIES FIRST DAY FILINGS THEY DISCUSS A POTENTIAL LIABILITY COULD EXCEED. THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS HOW LIKELY IS THIS FIGURE. TODAY IS THAT SOMETHING THAT. THEY HAD IT IN ME -- TO AND AND WERE THERE ANY TRIGGERING EVENTS THAT WOULD NECESSITATE P. JEANNIE REALIZING. ON THE BALANCE SHEET SOONER THAN THAT. MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT NUMBER INCLUDED THE POTENTIAL OF THEIR LIABILITY FOR THE TUBS FIRE. AND SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT. THEIR CURRENT ASSESSMENT IS OF WHAT THEIR OUTSTANDING LIABILITY IS. ALTHOUGH THEY DID TAKE RECENTLY ELEVEN POINT [inaudible] FIVE BILLION -- RIGHT DOWN FOR THEIR CURRENT YEAR. THANK YOU AND THEN THE OTHER -- ONE AND IT YOU'D MENTIONED THAT -- YOU'RE THE GOING TO CONTINUE I THINK THE REPORT PROVIDING SERVICE IN THAT THERE ARE A THAT THAT'S ON GOING THAT'S NOT REALLY A QUESTION BUT I GUESS MY CONCERN IS. HOW DO YOU ENSURE A SAFE UTILITY IN YOU'RE NOT JUST THROUGHOUT THE BANKRUPTCY BUT REALLY AS WE GO AFTER THAT -- UTG CONTINUED THEIR OPERATIONS IT WAS TWO MILLION CHANGED ISSUE ISSUE SAID BUT HOW CAN OPERATIONS IN PROOF AND AND AND HOW ARE YOU TRACKING THAT TODAY A BAD RAP TO SOME EXTENT AND AND I'VE. BEEN THERE GIVING THAT BAD RAP TO SOME EXTENT OF BUT IT -- IT IN A LOT OF THAT IS. YOU KNOW PERTAINS TO THE STRUGGLE THAT YOU FACE. IN JUST. THE STRUGGLE THAT YOU FACE IS IN IN TERMS OF THE INTO THE HAND CUFFS YOU HAVE ON YOUR OPERATIONS ALL OF THE TIME AND THE REFORMS THAT I THINK ARE NECESSARY AT THE FOR UC TO GIVE YOU THE AND THE THE STRATEGIC ABILITY TO BE MORE NIMBLE AND TO TO DO. THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE LEGISLATION OVER THE YEARS. OF THE CITATION AUTHORITY AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT KIND OF SPEED UP THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE UTILITIES ARE SAFE BUT FROM WHAT WE WE SEE THERE'S A A FIVE YEAR DELAY IN SOME CASES YOU KNOW THE PRICE. BEFORE YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING -- AND SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE KNOW THEY'RE MOVING FORWARD THEY'RE STILL OPERATING HOW CAN WE GUARANTEE THAT THEY WILL DO IT IN A SAFE MANNER OUR ON IN THE SHORT TERM. NEAR THE SB NINE A ONE REQUIRED YOU KNOW THE ADDITIONAL OFFER MITIGATION PLANS -- THOSE HAVE BEEN FILED -- TO A VERY MUCH AN ALL HANDS ON DECK -- PROCESS OF THE P. YOU SEE THAT IS THE TOP PRIORITY JUDGES AND STAFF FOR BEING MOVED TO THOSE OF THOSE GET APPROVED -- IN THE TIME FRAME LAID OUT IN -- NINE OH ONE FROM A FUNDING STANDPOINT BECAUSE THOSE DO COST MONEY -- THEY CAN FIND THOSE -- PROGRAMS HERE ONCE WE AUTHORIZE THEM. WE'RE ALSO WORKING TO IS QUICKLY AS WE CAN I CAN WITHIN OUR OWN RULES TO APPROVE A REQUEST FOR THE MEMORANDUM ACCOUNTS AND OTHER ISSUES. AMEND MEDLEY SOMETIMES THAT GETS BOGGED DOWN IN OUR OWN RULES IN THE TIME FRAME IN WHICH UTILITY WOULD LIKE IT APPROVED VERSES WHICH WE CAN. BUT WE'RE STILL DOING QUICK TURNAROUND ON ON THOSE. I THINK LONGER TERM THE QUESTION YOU'RE ASKING IS THE SAME QUESTION WE WERE ASKING BEFORE THEY WENT INTO BANKRUPTCY. WHEN THE NEW PHASE OF THE SAFETY CULTURE -- AYE AYE ORDER INSTITUTE INVESTIGATION WAS OPEN -- YOU KNOW IN THE ORIGINAL -- SCOPE OF THAT OPENED UP YOU KNOW WHITNEY OF TRY -- GENIES HAD SINCE DECEMBER AND WHAT VERSION ON AND ASK THE QUESTION ORGANIZATIONALLY IS P. JEANNIE SET UP. TO PROVIDE SAFE SERVICE I'M SO WE ANTICIPATED AND I THINK STONE DISSIPATE THAT THAT IS THE VENUE WHERE WE HAVE -- A VERY PUBLIC CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN WITH PGA AND HE YOU KNOW GOING FORWARD GIVEN THE HISTORY AND GIVEN THE ISSUES THAT WE JUST LAID OUT WITH THEIR CHALLENGES IN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT -- AND I APPRECIATE HEARING THAT. I'M KIND OF A RECOGNITION OF THE PROBLEM -- AND YOU KNOW WE WE'VE JUST SEEN AND WE HEARD LAST WEEK P. JEANNIE. IDENTIFY A TRANSMISSION TOWER PROBLEM THAT THE TAKING SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR IN TERMS OF THEIR EQUIPMENT -- BUT THEN WE LOOK AT THE INSPECTIONS THAT P. JEANNIE CONDUCTED OF THESE TOWERS HISTORICALLY AND THERE SEEMS TO BE A LACKS OF A LACK OF OF CONTINUITY AND OF EXPERTISE DONE WITH THAT. AND WHAT WE FIND IS THE SELF SELF REGULATION AND SELF MONITORING ITSELF AUDITING AND THE CHALLENGE WITH THAT. I KNOW IF IF IF IF A UTILITY IS DOING A GOOD JOB WE EXPECT THEM TO TO MONITOR THAT AND AND DO A GOOD JOB BUT WHEN WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE WITH P. JEANNIE -- HE AND IN THAT CALLS FOR INSPECTING THEIR WORK IS THAT CONTEMPLATED [inaudible] YES. YES -- IN FACT I AM WORKING VERY CLOSELY RIGHT NOW WITH MY ENFORCEMENT -- DIRECTOR DEPUTY DIRECTOR LIZ VITA MALASHENKO ON THIS AND WE ARE LOOKING AT IT AND WE HAVE TO MAKE CHANGES. BECAUSE WE ARE RELIANT ON THE YLIDES TO DO WHAT WE'RE TELLING THEM IN MANDATING AND REGULATING THEM TO DO. SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY DON'T DO IT AND YOU FIND THEM. AND THEN YOU FIND THEM AGAIN. AND AGAIN. SO WHAT DO WE HAVE SOME. WE'VE GOT TO COME UP WITH A DIFFERENT SOLUTION. AND WE ARE YOU KNOW THE WILD FAR TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCES IS FOCUSED ON WILDFIRES BUT YOU KNOW WHAT CAN WE DEAL FROM WITH TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE DO I NEED TO HIRE THREE HUNDRED INVESTIGATORS. I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE ANSWER BUT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING. RIGHT NOW I HAVE [inaudible] EIGHTEEN STATEWIDE. WE HAVE TO MAKE CHANGES SENATORS THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I I WANTED TO FOLLOW ACTUALLY FOLLOW UP ON THE LINE OF QUESTIONING FROM SENATOR HILL DO APPRECIATE YOUR BEING HERE AND FOR THE DEEP DIVE WERE TAKING -- YOU KNOW ON ON THIS QUESTION OF OF SORT OF ENFORCEMENT CAPACITY AND THE ABILITY TO SAY WALK AND CHEW GUM AT THE SAME TIME ACTUALLY SOMETHING MUCH MORE DIFFICULT IN THIS CASE WHICH IS TO ENSURE SAFE UTILITY. AND NOT ABANDON ALL OF OUR POLICIES THAT WE THAT BY THE HEART OF CALIFORNIA'S ETHOS FOR WITH WHO WE ARE AS A STATE. I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT -- YEAH THE PUBLIC PURPOSES OF BEING LEFT BEHIND THROUGH THIS BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING SO FIRST WANTED. TO THANK YOU ALL FOR ASSERTING STANDING WITH AGGRESSION AND AND PUTTING FOR THE STATE'S CASE REALLY PARTICIPATING EARLY ON AND FOR THE THE THE THE ABILITY TO GET THE STAYS ON ON OUR PUBLIC PURPOSE PROGRAMS I THINK THAT. I WOULD'VE BEEN VERY DANGEROUS PRECEDENT -- SO WE'LL BE KEEPING AN EYE ON THAT BUT WE APPRECIATE THAT OR I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT POSITION -- BUT IN TERMS OF THIS QUESTION OF HE DID. ADEQUATELY CONTINUE TO PUSH ENFORCEMENT WHILE YOU'RE DEALING WITH NINE OH ONE REVIEWS WHILE YOU'VE GOT. A GENERAL RATE CASE IT'S BEEN SITTING THERE -- FOR I DON'T KNOW HOW HOW LONG EDISON'S CASES BEEN BEFORE THE COMMISSION BUT A WHILE -- HI I KNOW THAT THIS IS SOMEWHAT OF A BUDGET COM QUESTION BECAUSE BCP'S HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED AND YOU ARE ASKING FOR STAFF CAPACITY BUT IN SOME OF IT GETS DOWN. TO DRINK YOUR QUESTIONS OF LAW LIKE I MEAN THERE'S A THERE'S A PIPELINE THAT SEPARATE HADN'T UPGRADED. FOR I THINK OVER A YEAR SINCE IT RUPTURED THAT NAY WAS NO REMOTE SENSING CAPABILITY FOR IT -- DOWN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SO EVEN IF YOU HAD -- IN ALL THE NEW TECH IN THE WORLD LIKE THAT OLD PIPE UNDERGROUND IS PRETTY TOUGH TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S WRONG UNTIL IT SOMETHING GOES REALLY BAD -- AND THERE ARE NONE OF THE REMOTE SENSING PICKED IT UP AND YET NOW HOSTS SEVEN CALIFORNIA'S. ELECTRIC RATE FACE IS GONNA TAKE A HIT FOR THAT FOR HAVING SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS IN THAT BASIN. SO. HOW DO YOU? WHAT IS THE NEW PIECE IN THE HANDS OF NEWS HANDS ON SORT OF APPROACH LOOK LIKE IN YOUR MIND ME WHAT? IS IT JUST ABOUT BODIES OR IS IT ABOUT SOME OTHER. SORT OF AUTHORITY THAT THAT'S NEEDED TO TO GO DO THIS JOB IN A IN A WAY THAT [inaudible] YES. THIS IS A LITTLE INHERENTLY SKEPTICAL I GUESS AT THIS POINT. WE WOULD APPRECIATE THAT THAT SKEPTICISM ON BEHALF ALL THE REPAIRS ARE CONSTITUENTS. YEAH I WILL SAY THAT -- WE ARE LOOKING AT ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING TO HELP WITH THAT SITUATION WE ARE OPEN TO YOUR IDEAS. TO BECAUSE LIKE I SAID WE ARE LOOKING AT TECHNOLOGY BUT AS YOU SAID IT DOESN'T SOLVE EVERYTHING YOU KNOW JUST THINK THIS TAKE TELEPHONE POLES FOR EXAMPLE. YOU KNOW HOW MANY POLLS ARE THERE HOW MANY MILLIONS OF POLES ARE THERE IN CALIFORNIA. HOW MANY IGNITION SOURCES IS THAT? AND WHO OWNS THOSE POLLS THE UTILITIES AND THEN YOU HAVE THE CA TELECOMS WHO HAVE A PIECE OF THE POLE AND AND THEN YOU GOT FIVE G. COMING ON WHO'S GOING. TO CREATE THIS GIANT. IS TO PUT ON THE POLE AND WHAT DOES THAT DO AND AND HOW DOES THAT IMPACT SAFETY BECAUSE NOW YOU HAVE MORE ON THAT POLE SO WE ARE I MEAN THIS IS THE LEVEL OF DETAIL IN THE THINGS THAT WE'RELOOKING AT BECAUSE WE HAVE. TO AND THAT ELECTRIC THAT'S GAS DON'T FORGET WE REGULATE UBER AND LIFT AND TOUR BUSES AND WATER RATES AND RAIL FOR CALIFORNIA I MEAN THIS ISN'T JUST ONE AREA. YOU SEE WE DO A LOT SO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT ALL OF THOSE AREA FROM A SAFETY PERSPECTIVE. SO YEAH I MEAN AND I'M I'M ABSOLUTELY OPEN BUT YOU'RE RIGHT THROWING RESOURCES IN MORE POSITIONS ISN'T NECESSARILY THE ANSWER. OKAY WELL I I'LL LOOK FOR A POINT THAT THREAD VIEW ALL AND BUDGET SUB ESPECIALLY IN STARTED AGAIN THERE -- LAST QUESTION IS IS ABOUT YET IF SENATOR DODD BROUGHT IT UP BUT SORT OF THE THIS COST TO CAPITAL QUESTION -- HAVE YOU GUYS DONE ANY INITIAL ASSESSMENT -- SORT OF ESTIMATES ABOUT WHAT IMPACT. COSTA BORROWINGS HAVING. A MEMBER COULD HAVE YEAH NOT. NOT YET -- YOURTHERE IS YOUR WE HAVE A PROCEEDING THAT THE ALL THE UTILITIES ARE REQUIRED TO FILE. THIS YEAR ACTUALLY I THINK IN MARCH THIS MONTH -- APPLICATIONS FOR A NEW ROUND OF COST OF CAPITAL REVIEW -- IN THE WAY THAT WORKS PROCEDURALLY IS. SIMILAR ANY OTHER PROCEEDING WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS WITH THE PARTIES TO THE PROCEEDINGS TO GO THROUGH AND LOOK AT WHAT THE COST OF CAPITAL IS. ON FILE NOTE ON HERE TWO YEARS AGO -- THE UTILITIES CAME IN WITH A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH A LOT OF PARTIES AND SAID LET'S LEAVE THE COST OF CAPITAL THE SAME -- WITH A SLIGHT BUMP DOWN -- IN DELAY A FULL REVIEW ON FOR THREE YEARS IN THE COMMISSION SAID WE'LL DO A TWO YEAR DELAY BECAUSE WE WERE ANXIOUS TO GET AND AND GO THROUGH THE COST OF CAPITAL BECAUSE WE QUITE FRANKLY WE THOUGHT WAS TOO HIGH. NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN WE'RE GONNA GO INTO THIS IN A VERY DIFFERENT SITUATION HAN WE THOUGHT BUT THAT IS ANOTHER. CHALLENGES ACTUALLY PUT ON THE P. UC'S PLATE YOU KNOW STARTING RIGHT NOW TIMING ON THAT PRECEDING ESTIMATE DOES IT STARTS IN MARCH YEAH THEY FILE IN MARCH SO I MEAN YOU'RE YOU'RE WHERE IS ANYBODY ON TIME FOR OF OUR PROCEEDINGS THAT YOU KNOW IT'S A YEAR TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS -- MAKE IT MORE COMPLICATED THIS TIME AROUND BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WE ONE OF THE UTILITIES IS INSOLVENT -- I DON'T NOT I HAD CAN'T WRAP MY HEAD EXACTLY HOW WE'RE GONNA WORK THROUGH THIS RIGHT NOW IS TO ADD TO THE PLATE OF SORT OF DO THINGS FASTERBETTER ALL THE TIME -- IT SEEMS HARD TO HAVE ACOSTA CAPITAL PROCEEDING IS GONNA WRAP UP AFTER. THIS EXCLUSIVITY PERIOD ENDS WITH P. JEANNIE AROUND THE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING WHERE WE REALLY. WE DON'T GO IN BLIND IN OTHER WORDS TO THAT RESOLUTION AROUND FEASIBILITY WITHOUT KNOWING. WHAT IS THE RATE BASE GONNA HIT SO? MAYBE THAT'S A DEATH FOR I'M FUTURE CONVERSATION JUST HOW TO ALIGN. THE STARTED THESE OTHER REGULATORY PROCESSES WITH THE TIMING IN BANKRUPTCY IN MACOMB CO HERE SO WE CAN. WE CAN MAKE GOOD DECISIONS OURSELVES IN AND WE ARE AND IT'S NOT JUST US IT'S PROCEEDING FORGETS THE COURT PROCEEDINGS OUGHT. TO TRYING TO GET CHART ALL OF THIS OUT RIGHT NOW CARE A LOT OF MOVING PARTS GOOD INNER BRADFORD. HE WAS GERMAN. I IT JUST REAL QUICK I'M PRETTY SURE YOU'VE WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT REPAIRS SO JUST CURIOUS ON WHAT ASSURANCES WILL P. C. ALKA TO BEFORE PROVING. OUR SHOULD I SEE IMPACTING -- THE BANKRUPTCIES COURT DECISION TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FEAR AND REASONABLE -- PLAN THAT DOESN'T IMPACT REPAIRS WHAT IMPACT WILL YOU GUYS OUR INVOLVEMENT SHOULD I SEE WHAT YOU HAVE IN THAT [inaudible] SO. PART OF THE SHEEP UC'S CHARGE IS. TO ADDRESS THE INTERESTS OF RATEPAYERS AND THEN YOU KNOW WE ARE QUITE ASIDE A JUDICIAL AGENCY. AND ANY. BANKRUPTCY PLAN. THAT THE CPUC. WHAT APPROVED WOULD BE IN ONE OF OUR PROCEEDINGS THAT WOULD HAVE THE PARTICIPATION? OF REPAIR ADVOCATES AND IN THOSE PROCEEDINGS TO GIVE THEIR VIEWS I'M SURE YOU'LL HEAR FROM TURN THEIR HERE TODAY -- AND WE RELY ON YOU KNOW ALL OF THE PARTIES TO OUR PROCEEDINGS TO GIVE US INFORMATION AND AND ADVOCATE FOR THE POLICIES THAT YOU KNOW WE NEED. TO TO REVIEW BEFORE ADOPTING. BEYOND REPAIR INTERESTS AND AFFORDABILITY ARE VERY IMPORTANT -- INTERESTED THAT ARMED WE ARE LOOKING AT IN OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS. WHAT I AND A AND A THAT AND WE CONCERTATO BUT REPAIRS BUT AS WE SAW TWENTY YEARS AGO REPAIRS PAID FOR THIS? I AS WE SAW ON SAINT BRUNO REPAIRS PAID FOR THIS AND SHAREHOLDERS NEVER TAKE A HIT. ON ANY OF THESE INCIDENTS SO AT WHAT POINT REALLY DO YOU START LOOKING AFTER THE REPAIRS BUT WE CAN SAY THAT FOR ANOTHER. IN COULD I COULD SEE ON THE SAN BRUNO SHAREHOLDERS TO TAKE A HIT ON THAT. AND AND AND SOME OF THE FINES ADDED TO SO. VERY WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND OF COURSE -- AS USUAL YOU HAVE YOUR WORK CUT OUT FOR YOU. THEN THANK YOU. FOR TAKING THE TIME TO COME OUT HERE [inaudible] WE'RE GONNA. FOLLOW UP WITH -- STAKEHOLDERS IN THE COMMUNITY THE PEOPLE THAT ARE AFFECTED BY ALL THIS. AND AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THIS BANKRUPTCY HAS A STAKEHOLDER COMMITTEE -- THESE MEMBERS THAT ARE HERE NOT -- PARTIES TO THE STAKEHOLDER COMMITTEE BUT THEY ARE AFFECTED BY PEOPLE THAT ARE IN STATE CALLED HOLDER COMMITTEE AND REPRESENTED BY SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF THAT ARE STAKEHOLDER COMMITTEE. BUT WE WANT TO HEAR. FROM THEM -- WE'RE WORK FOR PURCHASE WANT TO RESPECT PEOPLE'S CALENDARS. AND AS WERE LOONIES LOSING MEMBERS I WANT TO I SAID AS YOU COME FORWARD IT IF YOU CAN. MAKE YOUR COMMENTS AND TRY TO BE BRIEF BECAUSE WE DO HAVE A LONG LIST OF OF OF INDIVIDUALS ON THIS LIST BEGINNING WITH. UP MAYOR JODY JONES FROM THE TOWN OF PARADISE. MARK TONY. THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK. TOM DAZZLED THE BUSINESS MANAGER FOR THE INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS. A LOCAL -- TWELVE FORTY FIVE WE HAVE CATHERINE ELLIOTT SHE IS -- COUNSEL TO MEN MENDOCINO COUNTY REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES. AND BETH ON THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE CHOICE ASSOCIATION. AND ONCE MORE WE HAVE WITH US. GEN SMITH AND JONES HE'S THE WITH THE INDEPENDENT ENERGY PRODUCERS WELCOME EVERYBODY THANKS FOR BEING HERE. AND WE'LL BEGIN WITH -- MAYOR JERRY JONES WELCOME. AND AND AND IF YOU CAN TURN ON YOUR MIND [inaudible] ONCE AGAIN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. HI I AM JODY JONES THE MAYOR OF PARADISE IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN PARADISE SUFFERED HISTORICAL DEVASTATION AS A RESULT OF THE CAMPFIRE. THE DEADLIEST AND MOST DESTRUCTIVE UTILITY CAUSED WILDFIRE IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. IT BURNED OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE THOUSAND ACRES AND DESTROYED NEARLY EIGHTEEN THOUSAND BUILDINGS INCLUDING FOURTEEN THOUSAND HOMES. THE CAMPFIRE TRAGICALLY KILLED EIGHTY SIX PEOPLE. TO BE SURE THE TOWN OF PARADISE HAS SUFFERED HISTORICAL DEVASTATION THAT NO COMMUNITY SHOULD EVER EXPERIENCE OR INDOOR. THE LASTING EFFECTS ON FAMILIES CHILDREN AND THOSE WHO LOST THEIR LOVED ONES WILL LINGER-THROUGHOUT ENTIRE LIFETIMES. AND SOME SCHOLARS MAY NEVER BE HEALED. DESPITE THE PAIN SUFFERING AND DESTRUCTION THE TOWN A PARADISE RESULTS TO REBUILD. THE TOWN AND ITS CITIZENS HAVE EMBARKED ON THIS JOURNEY TOWARD RECOVERY AND IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR RECOVERY IT WAS TERRIBLY DISHEARTENING TO LEARN OF P. GENIES CHOICE TO VOLUNTEER TERRIBLY FILE FOR CHAPTER ELEVEN BANKRUPTCY. OUR SUCCESSFUL RECOVERY REQUIRES IMPART THE IMMEDIATE AND PROFESSIONAL ATTENTION OF P. GINNY. ON IMPORTANT SAFETY AND HAZARD MITIGATION PROJECTS IN THE WAKE OF THE WILDFIRE. INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE REMOVAL OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF TREES THAT ARE DEAD OR DYING. MONITORING IN SECURING PUBLIC UTILITIES SUCH AS GAS AND ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS. AND REBUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE SUCH AS UTILITY POLES THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS. P. GENIES CHOICE TO FILE BANKRUPTCY CALLS INTO QUESTION THE PRIORITIES OF THIS MULTI BILLION DOLLAR FOR PROFIT CORPORATION. RPG NEEDS TOP PRIORITY SAFETY HAZARD MITIGATION AND WILDFIRE RECOVERY OR IS THEIR TOP PRIORITY FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING TO PROTECT PROFITS AND MARKET VALUE FOR WALL STREET INVESTORS. WHAT THEY DO IN THIS VOLUNTARY BANKRUPTCY WILL SPEAK VOLUMES AS TO ITS INTENTIONS AND WHETHER IT PLANS TO COMPENSATE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED TO REBUILD? ARE THEY FOCUSED ON RECOVERY AND MAKING COMMUNITIES HOLE OR WILL THEY FORCE VICTIMS INTO MY MULTI YEAR CLAIMS PROCESS THAT DIFFERS AND DELAYS ARE RECOVERY. MORE THAN THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE RENDERED HOMELESS BY THE CAMPFIRE. FOR MONTHS LATER MANY ARE STILL LIVING IN RV'S OR MOTEL ROOMS OR FRIENDS EXTRA BEDROOMS. AS RECOVERY IS DELAYED HOMELESSNESS LINGERS AND HOUSING CRISIS CONTINUES AND FAMILIES CONTINUE TO LIVE WITHOUT THE DO DIGNITY OF THEM. P. GENIES ACTIONS IN THE UPCOMING WEEKS AND MONTHS WILL HAVE A RIPPLE EFFECT IN OUR COMMUNITY FOR YEARS TO COME. A DELAYED RECOVERY PERIOD WILL HAVE COMPOUNDED DEFECTS AS DELAYED TAX REVENUES. MEANS INCREASINGLY DELAYED RECOVERY. PARADISE NORMALLY ISSUES ABOUT THIRTY BUILDING PERMITS PER YEAR. FOR FIRE RECOVERY WITH AN AGGRESSIVE REBUILD RATE OF FOUR HUNDRED HOMES PER YEAR IT WILL TAKE ABOUT TWENTY FOUR YEARS FOR THE TOWN TO REGAIN ITS TAX BASE. OUR ROUGH ESTIMATE. SHOW THAT THE TELL WILL LOSE OVER A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION IN REVENUES. THAT'S A TOWN THAT HAS THE GENERAL FUND BUDGET ANNUALLY OF ABOUT TWELVE MILLION. EVERY MAJOR FUNDING SOURCE OF THE TOWN IS COMPROMISED JUST THE FIRST YEAR ALONE. WILL LOSE FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION IN PROPERTY TAXES THAT ARE 41% OF OUR GENERAL FUND BUDGET. WILL LOSE TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION IN SALES AND USE TAX TWO POINT ONE MILLION. IN MOTOR VEHICLE IN LIEU TAX. AND ONE POINT TWO MILLION IN FRANCHISE FEES AND T. O. T. TAXES. AND NOT PART OF OUR GENERAL FUND BUT A REALLY IMPORTANT THING IS OUR ROADS ARE -- DETERIORATING BECAUSE OF THE FIRE AND ALL OF THE TRUCKS USING THEM. WILL LOSE ONE POINT TWO MILLION OF OUR GAS TAXES. SO FOR THE COMMUNITY OF PARADISE JUSTICE DELAYED IS JUSTICE DENIED. DELAYING THROUGH BANKRUPTCY THE RESOURCES NECESSARY FOR RECOVERY IS LIKE KICKING A COMMUNITY THAT P. GENIES ALREADY KNOCKED DOWN. THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY OF PARADISE HOPES THAT P. JEANNIE USES THIS BANKRUPTCY AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPEDITE. NOT DELAY OUR COMMUNITIES RECOVERY THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE [inaudible] MARK TURNED. I MARK TONY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF TURN THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK THANK YOU FOR INVITING US TO SPEAK. IN THE TWO THOUSAND AND ONE P. JEANNIE BANKRUPTCY. RATE PAYERS WERE HIT FOR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN COUGH -- P. JEANNIE CUSTOMERS WERE FORCED TO PAY. SIX POINT TWO BILLION. EIGHT POINT TWO BILLION. IN ABOVE PRICES. FOR A PERIOD OF EIGHT YEARS TOTAL. THAT RESULTED IN BILL INCREASES OF ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS. TO ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS AVERAGE PER CUSTOMER OVER EIGHT YEARS. WELL P. JEANNIE STOCK HAD DIED TO LEFT AND SEVEN DOLLARS PER SHARE AFTER THE BANKRUPTCY FILING. IT RECOVERED TO TWENTY NINE DOLLARS PER SHARE ONE WEEK AFTER THE COURT RESOLUTION OF BANKRUPTCY. THE STOCK REBOUND PERMITTED P. JEANNIE TO DISTRIBUTE EIGHTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN BONUSES TO SEVENTEEN CURRENT AND FORMER EXECUTIVES FOR STICKING WITH THEM THROUGH THE BANKRUPTCY SO. THE OTHER THING THAT HAPPENED IS THAT THE ACTUAL COST OF BANKRUPTCY WITH ENORMOUS. THE P. GINNY SPENT FOUR HUNDRED AND TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS. IN LEGAL AND PROFESSIONAL EXPENSIVE LAST TIME AROUND. NOW ACCORDING TO THE EIGHT K. THAT P. JEANNIE FILED JEFF FEBRUARY TWENTY EIGHTH. LAST WEEK. THERE ESTIMATED COSTS FOR LEGAL FEES FOR THE BANKRUPTCY THIS TIME AROUND. FOR THE YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN A LOAN. IS FOUR HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS. PHOTO JEFF ADD THAT BY. TIME THAT BY THREE WHICH IS HOW LONG IT TOOK LAST TIME THE ACTUAL COST AND THERE'S NO LIMIT BY THE WAY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT SETS NO LIMIT TO HOW MUCH THE COST FAR. FOR REPAIRS ARE GOING TO BE. WHAT TURN HAS REQUESTED IN IN CONJUNCTION WITH WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAS REQUESTED IS THAT THERE BE A RATE PAYER COMMITTEE? AS PART OF THE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING. AT A RECOGNITION OF AN OFFICIAL A GREAT PICK CAM AND THE REASON THAT IS SO CRITICAL. IS BECAUSE THE PROPOSAL THAT P. GENIE IS GOING TO BRING FORWARD. MONEY THAT'S PRESUMED IN THAT. ACTUALLY TIES THE CPU FREES HANDS OKAY ONCE THEY GET FOR THEM. THE WHAT THEY CAN DO IS CONSTRAINED THAT'S WHY WE NEED A RATE PAYER COMMITTEE. AND WE HAVE A REQUEST THAT'S% BEEN SIGNED BY THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE AT THE P.. A A RP CALIFORNIA THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU SIERRA CLUB GREEN LINING INSTITUTE WE HAVE ALL REQUESTED. THAT A RATE PAYER COMMITTEE BE OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED FOR A WEEK CAN BE PART OF THE NEGOTIATION. OF THE PROPOSAL THAT P. G. AND HE PUTS OUT THERE BECAUSE WE THINK HAT WE WILL HAVE MORE IMPACT AT LIMITING RATE PAYER COST. EARLY IN THE PROCESS THEN WAITING TILL THE END OF THE PROCESS AFTER IT'S ALREADY GOTTEN TO THE CPC AFTER THERE ARE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ALL READY [inaudible] YOU KNOW. BAKED IN TO THE SETTLEMENT PLAN. SO WE WOULD APPRECIATE THE SENATE -- ENERGY UTILITIES -- COMMUNICATIONS COMMITTEE CONSIDER SUBMITTING A LETTER OF SUPPORT. AND ASKING THE CPU FEE TO SUBMIT A LETTER OF SUPPORT THANK YOU. COME OUT ALSO. HI. MY NAME IS TOM BILLS ALL I AM THE BUSINESS MANAGER OF IBEW LOCAL TO PRESENT ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND OF P. GENIES -- EMPLOYEES. ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND CONTRACTOR LINEMEN WORKING AT PGA ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND THREE MINE CLEARANCE TREE TRIMMERS WORKING AT P. GINNY FOR CONTRACTORS -- WE WERE HERE I WAS HERE IN TWO THOUSAND ONE WITH THAT BANKRUPTCY IN. I THINK THE ONLY REAL SIMILARITY IS DRIVEN BY POLICY -- THAT WAS DRIVEN BY. DE REGULATION WHERE. EACH IN THE COULD ONLY CHARGE SO MUCH FOR WHAT THEY WERE SELLING ACTUALLY ALL UTILITIES. AND BECAUSE OF THE REGULATION AND RON IN THE CITY OF READING AND W. P. WE'RE ALL GAMING THE SYSTEM SO THEY WERE BUYING HERE BUYING HI SELLING LOW. THAT WAS A POLICY FAILURE ON THEIR SOME POLICY FAILURES HERE -- YOUR HONOR ON THE ONE HAND IT'S COMPLICATED I PREPARED AS A VISUAL AID FOR OUR MEMBERS -- MAN. WE WE COULD DO THAT JUST AS WELL AS WELL. THE FIRST ROUND [inaudible] PRETTY -- SO IN THE CENTER ARE THE ESSENTIAL CLAIMS -- IN SUCH AS THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN CLAIMS EIGHTEEN CLAIMS. ARE THE IN THE IN THE ISSUES IN PLAY. THE ORANGE CIRCLE ARE THE PLACES WHERE IT'S BEING FOUGHT. ALTHOUGH WHEN I MADE THIS WE DIDN'T HAVE THE SIXTY DAY STRIKE FORCE BY THE GOVERNOR. AND THEN ON THE OUTSIDE OR THE MAJOR INTERESTED PARTIES. AND THIS JUST SHOWS HOW INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED IT IS. AND THE MATHEMATICIANS HERE CAN FIGURE OUT. HOW MANY DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF THIS THERE ARE -- IT'S VERY VERY COMPLEX WE WE WE HEARD THAT FROM. FROM -- PROFESSOR AND NOT FROM HASTINGS. ON THE ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S IT'S FAIRLY PART OF IT'S VERY SIMPLE. AND THAT IS FOR FOR P. JEANNIE TO EMERGE FROM BANKRUPTCY. THE PLAYGROUND CAN'T BE THE SAME THE THE PLAYING FIELD CANNOT BE THE SAME THERE HAS TO BE A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE OR TWO THERE. HAVE TO BE CHANGES IN P. JEANNIE. BUT THERE HAS TO BE A CHANGE EITHER IN LIABILITY OR IN. THE FUNDING AND AGREE AGREE THE STAKEHOLDERS IS LET'S NOT FOCUS ON INVERSE. AND STRICT LIABILITY LET'S FOCUS ON ON A RISK POOLS SUCH AS BUT FLORIDA DOES WITH HURRICANES. ARE SO IT'S HOW WE PAY -- RATHER THAN WHAT THE BAR IS TO PAY. NOTE IT CLEARLY HAS TO BE A SOLUTION THAT'S GOING TO HAVE THE SUPPORT OF ALMOST EVERY MAJOR PARTIES NOT EVERY MAJOR PARTY -- BUT IT OCCURS TO ME THAT UTILITIES ARE RISK AVERSE BY BY DEFINITION. AND I THINK THAT THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN RISK AVERSE AND THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN RISK AVERSE. AND IF WE'RE GONNA GET OUT OF THIS JAM THAT WERE AND HAS NOT JUST P. JEANNIE IT'S NOT JUST INVESTOR OWNS THE PUBLIC ON PUBLIC LOAN UTILITIES. ARE IN THE SAME SPOT. MEAN SMART READING PALO ALTO THEY'RE ALL THERE -- WHERE? I MEAN IF THE CAR FIRE HAD BEEN STARTED BY THE CITY OF READING. RATHER THAN A SPARK OFTEN AXLE CITY READING OF THE BANKRUPT TODAY. SO -- WE NEED WE NEED TO WE NEED TO SOLVE THAT NOW I'LL JUST MAKE ONE OBSERVATION -- ABOUT WHAT BANKRUPTCY HAS DONE AND IT HAS. SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE ROLE OF HEDGE FUNDS AND CALIFORNIA UTILITIES -- YEAH I THINK THAT TWO YEARS AGO AT THIS POINT. HEDGE FUNDS OWN 2% OF P. GENIES STOCK. TODAY DOWN 52%. AND I THINK THAT -- THERE ARE NEGOTIATIONS GOING ON RIGHT NOW. GINNY'S THOUGHT THAT THEY'D SWAP OUT MEMBERS THE BOARD RECORD HIGH THAT'S OUT THE WINDOW THEY ALL LIVE IN A GOING TO BE NEW. AND PROBABLY KNEW BY THE END OF THIS WEEK. AND THE HEDGE FUNDS ARE ARE JOCKEYING. HEAD TURNS PLAY A USEFUL ROLE BUT WHEN THEY'RE WHEN THE ONLY FOCUSES FINANCIAL -- SAFETY OPERATIONAL ISSUES ARE REALLY CRITICAL FOR SAVE FOR SAFETY AND FOR AND FOR FOR RATEPAYERS. SOME SIMPLE COMPLICATED -- THANK YOU TAKES A RISK. WILL MOVE ON TO CATHERINE ELLIOTT. THANK YOU CHAIR FOR SO IN REMAINING COMMITTEE MEMBERS CATHERINE L. IT COUNTY COUNCIL MENDOCINO COUNTY ON BEHALF OF THE SOCK -- IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN P. JEANNIE NORTH BAY FIRES TORE THROUGH. THE COMMUNITIES IN AT LEAST SEVEN DIFFERENT COUNTIES INCLUDING MENDOCINO CINEMA NAPA LAKE YUBA NEVADA AND BUTTE SO I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE PARTICULARLY IN THE FIRE COUNTIES BUT I'VE SPOKEN TO MANY OF MY OTHER COLLEAGUES IN THE OTHER COUNTIES TO BRING TO THIS INFORMATION TO YOU. IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE FIRE AND I SHOULD SAY YOU ASKED WHAT COULD THIS COMMITTEE. TO THIS IS A GOOD START SO I DO APPRECIATE THIS. IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE FIRE LAWLER COMMUNITIES WERE TRYING TO RECOVER P. JEANNIE ACTUALLY FILED CLAIMS AGAINST THE PUBLIC ENTITIES. THEY FILED COSTLY PUBLIC RECORD TERMS OF THEIR ONE REAL REMEDY WHICH WAS INVERSE CONDEMNATION AMONG OTHER BAIL UP. OPTIONS HERE IN MEN AND SACRAMENTO. PRIOR TO FILING THE CHAPTER ELEVEN BANKRUPTCY P. JEANNIE CHOSE NOT TO COMPENSATE. THE VICTIMS AND COMMUNITIES FIRST. P. JEANNIE NOW AND CHOICE THE PROTECTION OF CHAPTER ELEVEN YET STILL IS NOT PAID FOR THE DEVASTATING TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FIRES. TO QUOTE SENATOR HUESO REGARDING THIS BANKRUPTCY IT'S DISHEARTENING THAT IT HAS COME TO THIS. THE IMPACT TO P. GENIES BANKRUPTCY FILING INCLUDES THEIR LITIGATION PROTECTION TO THE DETRIMENT OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND FIRE VICTIMS. TO BE CLEAR P. GENIES DECISION TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY HALTED ALL STATE COURT LITIGATION AS YOU'VE HEARD INCLUDING THE DISCOVERY OF FACTS IN TRIAL BY JURY WHICH OFTEN ENCOURAGES RESOLUTION. THEY CHOSE FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY COURT ESSES LEGAL FORUM WHICH LEAVES LOCAL COMMUNITIES ASKING WHY. AND HOW LONG IS THIS GOING TO TAKE AND WHILE I REALLY APPRECIATED THE ACADEMIC DISCUSSION IN TERMS OF WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE IT LOOKS VERY DIFFERENT WHEN YOU'RE ON THE GROUND. WHAT P. GENIES INTENTION WHAT WAS P. GENIES INTENTION OF FILING THIS BANKRUPTCY WAS IT TO PREVENT THE TRIAL BY JURY? OR TO AVOID DISCOVERY OF IMPORTANT FACTS AND INFORMATION OR WAS IT JUST TO DELAY THE COMPENSATION TO VICTIMS AND COMMUNITIES. MY COUNTY CHOSE TO FILE A LAWSUIT AGAINST PGA ANY IN PART TO SHOW UNITY WITH THE INDIVIDUAL FIRE VICTIMS. IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN FAMILIES INSURANCE BENEFITS WILL COME TO AN END AT THE CURRENT PACE IT SEEMS UNLIKELY AND FROM WHAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY. THE P. JEANNIE WILL BE ABLE TO COMPENSATE OUR COMMUNITIES BY THE END OF THIS YEAR. WHICH MEANS FAMILIES INSURANCE BENEFITS WILL CEASE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL CONTINUE TO DELAY PUBLIC WORKS IN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS INP. JEANNIE WILL GET THROUGH ANOTHER YEAR WITHOUT PAYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IT OWES TO FIRE VICTIMS. BANKRUPTCY ITSELF CAN BE USED POSITIVELY. AS A TOOL TO RESOLVE THESE CLAIMS NOW OR IT CAN BE MISUSED AS A LEGAL FORUM. AND THE ABDICATION OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY THEREFORE IT'S CRUCIAL THAT WE HAVE THE STATE'S SUPPORT YOUR SUPPORT. TO ENSURE THAT WE PROTECT THE RATE PAYERS THAT WILDFIRE VICTIMS ARE TREATED FAIRLY AND RECEIVE JUST COMPENSATION FOR THEIR LOSSES. IT IS LIKELY THAT P. GENIE IS ALREADY APPROACHED MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE FOR ADDITIONAL LEGISLATIVE REGULATORY. OR ADMINISTRATIVE BAIL OUT OPTIONS JUST LIKE THEY DID IN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE HOWEVER IN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE ENORMOUS COSTS WERE POT PASSED ALONG TO BECAUSE CUSTOMERS. BUT THERE WAS NO REAL INCREASE IN SAFETY OUT PUBLIC SAFETY AT THAT TIME P. JEANNIE ASKED MANY COUNTIES. TO WAIVE THEIR PROPERTY TAX PENALTIES AND INTEREST IN EXCHANGE FOR P. JEANNIE GOING TO BANKRUPTCY COURT WITH A MOTION TO ALLOW THEM TO PAY THEIR TAXES. FOR COUNTIES THAT TEETER THEIR TAXES THIS CAUSES YOU HAD ANOTHER BURDEN ON ALREADY STRESSED ASSETS. P. GENIES BANKRUPTCY AFFECTS COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS. PROPERTY TAXES UTILITY TAXES FRANCHISE FEES AND UNITARY TAXES MANY COUNTIES HAVE AN ALLOCATION. OF RULE TWENTY EIGHTY FUNDS THAT CAN BE USED FOR UNDER GROUNDING LINES SINCE THIS IS A REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAM THE LOCAL AGENCY PAYS THE UNDERGROUND IN COST. AND THEN MUST WAIT FOR PAYMENT FROM PT ANY. OBVIOUSLY UNDER GROUNDING OF WILL HINES IMPROVES WHILE FIRE SAFETY. AND SHOULD BE SUPPORTED. ALL REIMBURSEMENTS HAVE SEIZED AT THE START. ANOTHER LOSS TO COUNTIES TO STREW P. GENIES GRANT PROGRAM THEY PROVIDE OVER TOWARD THE LAST YEAR THEY PROVIDED OVER TWENTY EIGHT MILLION. IN GRANTS YET IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THEY'RE TERRIBLE PROGRAM IS NOT SUBJECT TO REVIEW AS PART OF THE REORGANIZATION. THEY HAVE OPTED TO PUT THIS ON HOLD AS WELL. THERE ARE ALSO THE MANY INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS SUCH AS THE ORPHANED POTTER VALLEY PROJECT IN MENDOCINO COUNTY WHICH THEY ABANDONED TO FOR JUST BEFORE -- THE INDEED INDICATIVE PROPOSED JUST BEFORE FILING BANKRUPTCY. AFTER WE HAVE SPENT SUBSTANTIAL TIME AND MONEY THROUGHOUT -- MENDOCINO COUNTY CINEMA COUNTY AND MARIN THE UNCERTAINTY AND EXPENSE OF THE LICENSING PROCESS THROUGH FOR IS OVERWHELMING AND THE FUTURE EXTREMELY UNCERTAIN. FOR WATER IN THOSE AIR AND THOSE COUNTIES. DUE TO P. GENIES FIRES COSTS HAVE GONE UP. REVENUES HAVE GONE DOWN RESOURCES HAVE BEEN DIVERTED AND PRODUCTIVE ASSETS HAVE BEEN LOST. ROADS BRIDGES WATER SOIL PARKS TREES BUILDINGS FACILITIES TAXES FEES PERSONNEL. AND OUR FIRST RESPONDERS ARE SOME OF THE COST. OF THAT WE HAVE PAID BY THESE FIRES. P. GENIES CHOICE TO FILE BANKRUPTCY LEAVES ARE ALREADY RAVAGED COMMUNITIES WONDERING. HOW WILL WE EVER RECOVER MANY OF A THE SAME COMMUNITIES HAVE JUST DECLARED YET ANOTHER EMERGENCY BECAUSE OF THE FLOODS WE ARE RUNNING? OUT OF MONEY AND TIME. TO PARAPHRASE MY SENATOR SENATOR REQUIRE P. JEANNIE EXECUTIVE OR STOCK SPECULATORS SHOULD NOT PROFIT WHILEREPAIRS. TAXPAYERS AND EVERY DAY CALIFORNIANS ARE FOREVER IMPACTED THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS BOTH BOND [inaudible] THREE JIM -- GOOD MORNING OR GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH THE COMMITTEE TODAY. MY NAME'S BETH VAUGHN AND I'M EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY CHOICE ASSOCIATION -- HEALTHY CA WE REPRESENT COMMITTEE CHOICE AGGREGATORS THAT ARE OPERATING IN SERVING CUSTOMERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE EXPLORING THE OPPORTUNITIES OF COMMUNITY CHOICE. CURRENTLY THERE ARE NINETEEN CCA'S AN OPERATION EXPECTED TO SERVE AN ANNUAL LOAD OF APPROXIMATELY FORTY FOUR THOUSAND GIGAWATT HOURS. IN. TWENTY NINETEEN OXLEY 25% OF THE LOAD OF ALL THREE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES WILL BE SERVED BY CCA'S AND TWENTY NINETEEN IN P. GINNY SERVICE TERRITORY THERE ARE. TWELVE COMMUNITY COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS SERVING CUSTOMERS TOGETHER THE CCA SERVE APPROXIMATELY 46% OF P. GENIES. MODE. I'VE BEEN ASKED TO SPEAK TO THE IMPACT OF P. G.'S BANKRUPTCY FILING ON CCA'S. BUT BEFORE I DO THAT HOWEVER I'D JUST LIKE TO NOTE THAT -- THE EMERGENCE OF CCA'S IN THE ENABLING LEGISLATION THAT CREATED CCA'S WAS A RESULT OF THE LOS BANKRUPTCY. ON THE OTHER THING I WANT TO NOTE IS THAT. COUNT THAT THE CCA'S THROUGH CAL CCA HAVE BEEN COORDINATING AND PLANNING AHEAD FOR POTENTIAL P. JEANNIE BANKRUPTCY LONG IN ADVANCE OF THE JANUARY TWENTY NINTH FILING. AS A RESULT WE WERE NOT CAUGHT FLAT FOOTED AND WE'RE READY TO COORDINATE WITH PJ NEED A FLAG AND ADDRESS PUT POTENTIAL IMPACTS. TO STATE REGULATORS REGULATORS IN THE BANKRUPTCY COURT AS A RESULT PRACTICAL IMPACTS WERE MINIMIZED THOUGH NOT ALL TOGETHER ELIMINATED. WELL THERE ARE SEVERAL AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONCERN AND UNCERTAINTY FOR CUSTOMERS OF CCA'S WE BELIEVE IN THE AGGREGATE. THE BANKRUPTCY WILL NOT ACUTELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE RELIABLE. CLEAN ELECTRICITY TO HER CUSTOMERS. I'M JUST GONNA TOUCH ON FIVE POINTS -- THE THE BED THE BANKRUPTCY GIVES RISE TO UNCERTAINTY FOR US. THE FIRST P. GENIES REQUIRED TO PERFORM BUNDLE BILLING FOR CCA CUSTOMERS THIS MEANS THE BILL INCLUDES THE CHARGE. THE CHARGES FOR BOTH P. GENIES WIRE SERVICES AND THE CCA PROCUREMENT SERVICES. CONSEQUENTLY CONSEQUENTLY CC IS RELY ON P. JEANNIE TO COLLECT ALSO YOU SAY REVENUES. ENTRANCE THOSE REVENUES TO THE CCA. THESE ARE ACTUALLY DALY TRANSFERS. WELL THIS FLOW THROUGH PAYMENTS WAS AT RISK AS A RESULT OF THE BANKRUPTCY FILING THE INTERMISSION WAS GRANTED AND WE EXPECT A FINAL AUTHORIZATION OF THIS ARRANGEMENT ON MARCH TWELFTH. SECOND IN THE CONTEXT OF BILLING RELATIONSHIPS HE SEES HOLD EXECUTORY SERVICE AGREEMENTS WITHP. JEANNIE AS REQUIRED BY P. GENIES TERROR OF RULE TWENTY THREE REQUIREMENTS. TOGETHER REAL TWENTY THREE IN CC SERVICE AGREEMENTS DEFINE THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF INTERFACE BETWEEN PITCHING. GENIE SCCA. DURING THE COURSE OF PDAS BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING IT MUST EITHER ASSUME OR REJECT THESE CONTRACTS. WHAT WOULD MAKE LITTLE SENSE FOR P. JEANNIE TO REJECT THE CONTRACTS THE UNCERTAINTY REMAINS? ONGOING PURCHASES OF SUPPLY IN THE WHOLESALE MARKET FROM PGA ANY. THE BECAUSE P. GENIES LOTUS MIGRATING CCA'S. THEIR BUNDER BUNDLE PORTFOLIO HOLDS ACCESS RESOURCE ADEQUACY AND RENEWABLE PORTS FOR PORTFOLIO STANDARD PRODUCTS. THESES CONTRACT WITH P. JEANNIE TO PROCURE THESE RESOURCES. TO MEET THEIR OWN LOAD REQUIREMENTS. SINCE ALL EXECUTORY CONTRACTS SEEM TO REJECTED IN BANKRUPTCY THERE IS AT LEAST A THEORETICAL RISK THAT P. JEANNIE COULD REJECT THESE CONTRACTS. LEADING TO NON COMPLIANCE BY RELIANT CCA'S. THIS RISK REMAINS UNADDRESSED. ADDITIONAL RISK FOR CCA'S IS THAT OF CONTINUE NEED TO CONTINUING TO CONTRACT FOR THESE PRODUCTS WITH A COUNTER PARTY HIS CREDIT RATING IS NOW BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE. FOR EXAMPLE THIS MUD HE TRANSAXLE ON BEHALF OF VALLEY CLEAN ENERGY HOW TO ADJUST ITS ENERGY RISK POLICY TO CONTINUE TO TRANSACT WITH P. JEANNIE. FOURTH P. GINNY MUST ALSO LACKED IN THE BANKRUPTCY TO ASSUME OR REJECT THE AGREEMENTS WITH GENERATORS. WHICH UNDERLIE THE CECE'S WHOLESALE MARKET PURCHASES FROM P. JEANNIE. IF THE CONTRACT UNDERLINED THE RESALE BY P. GENIE IS REJECTED IT COULD AGAIN PLEASE THE CCA. I SUSPECT OTHER OTHER LSTS AT RISK OF COMPLIANCE THE THREE MINUTES HE'S. AND THEN FIFTH ON I DON'T NEED TO GO INTO THIS -- BECAUSE OTHERS SPEAKERS SPOKE TO THESE -- PUBLIC PURPOSE PROGRAM FUNDING. SUCH AS ENERGY EFFICIENCY -- THE CC IS ALSO HAVE THOSE AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE ORDER. AUTHORIZING P. JEANNIE TO CONTINUE THESE PROGRAMS WILL BE -- FINALIZED THE AUTHORIZATION MARCH THIRTEENTH. BEYOND THESE IMMEDIATE CONCERNS ANY RESTRUCTURING IN BANKRUPTCY THAT AFFECTS P. GENIES PORTFOLIO OR ITS RETAIL SUPPLY BUSINESS WILL AFFECT BOTH CC CUSTOMERS AND BOTTLE REPAIRS. FOR EXAMPLE. A FAVORITE TODAY'S EXIT FEE FOR CCA CUSTOMERS THE POWER CHARGING DIFFERENCE ADJUSTMENT OR P. CIA. IS DERIVED FROM P. GENIES PORTFOLIO COST CONSEQUENTLY ANY CHANGES IN THE PORTFOLIO WILL AFFECT THE LEVEL OF THE PC I A IT WILL DRIVE A CHANGE IN THE EXIT FEW CALCULATION AND WILL IMPACT THE SECOND PHASE. OF THE PROCEEDING OUT THE PC WHERE THE QUESTION OF REAL HOW DO WE REALIGN SUPPLY AND DEMAND. OF THE ENERGY PORTAL IS OF ALL THREE I USE IS BEING CONSIDERED. INTERESTINGLY THE SCHEDULE FOR THAT. IS IN TERMS OF THE PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION TECHNICAL WORKING GROUP TO REPORT OUT AND HAVE A FINAL DECISION BY MID TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT WHICH LISTENING TO PRESS REALIZES ALSO. THE DATE BY WHICH ON THE REORGANIZATION PROPOSAL -- FOR BY TEACHING YOU WOULD BE PERCENT. ABSOLUTELY -- FROM A BROADER -- IT LANDS WE RECOGNIZE THE BANKRUPTCY PRESENTS SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTY FOR OTHER SECTORS CRUCIAL TO OUR SUCCESS AS PROVIDERS OF CLEAN ENERGY. SPECIFICALLY RECOGNIZE THAT OUR ABILITY TO TRANSFORM INTO CARBONIZED CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY SYSTEM RELIES ON FUNCTIONAL FINANCIAL AND AFFORDABLE ELECTRICITY INFRASTRUCTURE. LIKEWISE OUR ABILITY TO AGGRESSIVELY DEVELOP RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS RELIES ON REAL RENEWABLE DEVELOPERS AD FIND ANSWERS. CONTINUING ENTHUSIASM FOR DOING BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MISTER CHAIRMAN CHANCE BUT THE JONES -- WITH THE INDEPENDENT ENERGY PRODUCERS -- AND I'LL TRY TO KEEP THIS UNDER FORTY FIVE MINUTES HI LÃ  THAT YOU HAVE TO BE SPECTACULAR YOU THE LIST OKAY. I'LL B I'LL TRY -- BUT I DID KNOW YOU HAD IT IN YOU BUT I THE I TOO WAS HERE LAST TIME AROUND -- AND I WON'T SAY BRETT BRINGS BACK FOND MEMORIES BUT THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF ISSUES THAT WILL COME UP THAT ARE DIRECTLY IN THE PURVIEW OF THIS -- THIS INSTITUTION -- AND THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS -- THAT SAID MY TO I THINK THIS WAS AGOOD VERY GOOD A GOOD USE OF EVERYONE'S TIME SO EVERYONE HAS SORT OF THE SAME BASELINE INFORMATION ABOUT -- WHAT WHAT THE IMPACTS HERE ARE OF GOING FORWARD -- WILL AND WHEN I'VE BEEN ASKED TO SPEAK TO TODAY WHERE THESE CONTRACTS THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT -- A COMING OUT OF THE ENERGY A A SYSTEM THAT LARGELY PREDICATED AYE CONTRACTS WE WE INSTITUTED AB. FIFTY SEVEN WHICH CREATED A WHOLE WAY A MECHANISM FOR US TO COME UP WITH PLANS PRE APPROVE -- THAT HAVE COMPETITIVE AUCTIONS PRE APPROVE THAT -- AND THAT WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL IN ATTRACTING A LARGE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL THAT HAS MODERNIZED -- ARE ARE GREEDY OUR OUR GENERATION -- AND IT HAS LED TO SOME -- PRETTY -- IMPRESSIVE -- PROGRESS IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING GREENHOUSE GAS -- OBVIOUSLY THE CAUSE OF THIS BANKRUPTCY IS NOT THEIR GENERATION PORTFOLIO OR PROCUREMENT IT'S OBVIOUSLY THE FIRE LIABILITY YOU HEARD A LOT ABOUT THAT EARLIER -- AND I THINK THAT THE GENERAL COUNSEL FOR DEEP UC AND HIS OCULAR DID A GREAT JOB OF SORT OF LAYING THE GROUNDWORK OF HOW THESE CONTRACTS. ARE ACTUALLY TIED TO CALIFORNIA LAWS SO THIS WAS A DAY MISS THE BIG THE THEY GUESSED WRONG ON BUYING PENCILS OR TRUCKS OR ANYTHING ELSE. THESE WERE IN RESPONSE TO SPECIFIC LAW -- ELEVEN THE RESOURCE ADEQUACY WHICH IS -- BASICALLY THREE EIGHTY SO THESE ARE LAWS THAT HAVE BEEN -- INSTITUTED THERE'S ALMOST A THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF P. GINNY CONTRACTS RELATED TO THE R. P. S. -- THERE'S ANOTHER -- FIVE THOUSAND THAT ARE RESOURC ADEQUACY THIS DEALS WITH GAS PLANTS AND OTHER TYPES OF RESOURCES INCLUDING -- THERE'S ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED OF ENERGY STORAGE THESE ARE ALL THE ADDRESS THERE THAT TO ADDRESS EITHER OUR PS OR KEEPING THE LIGHTS ON SO THEY'RE THEY'RE VERY IMPORTANT. THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THIS OVER TO YOU KNOW THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS OR WHATEVER COULD BE A SIZE FORTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS ACCORDING TO PGD DARKNESS THEY FILED SO IT'S NOT AN INCONSEQUENTIAL NUMBER. BUT THESE ARE PASSED THROUGH COSTS SO -- TERMINATING THESE CONTRACTS DOESN'T ADD ANY MONEY TO THE POOL OF MONEY THAT P. JEANNIE COULD PAY OTHER PEOPLE IN FACT OBVIOUSLY I HAVE CONCERNS REPRESENTING THE PEOPLE THE COUNTERPART IS THOSE CONTRACTS IS PRETTY OBVIOUS. BUT WHY SHOULD YOU BE CONCERNED WELL ASSUMING THEY REJECT CONTRACTS THAT'S NOT THE END OF THE STORY -- BASICALLY THE REJECTED CONTRACTS -- BASICALLY HAVE VARIOUS DAMAGES CLAY THE POOL A LUNCH THE FIRE VERY ELSE THIS IS THESE ARE NUMBERS I'M JUST MAKING UP IF I'M SMART NEW SOLAR. AND BY CONTRACT HAS BEEN TERMINATED -- THEY ARE A BIG SHOULD BE REJECTED IS IS THE ACTUAL WORD THAT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS GOES INTO THIS POOL RIGHT IT EVEN IF THEY'RE ONLY PAYING FIFTY SET AT FENCE FIFTY CENTS ON A DOLLAR. OR THIRTY FIVE CENTS ON THE DOLLAR THAT'S LESS MONEY FOR THE FIRE VICTIMS AND EVERYBODY ELSE THERE SO THAT'S OBVIOUSLY A BIG PROBLEM IS SOMETHING THAT. PEOPLE WANT TO CONSIDER THE SECOND PIECE IS IMPORTANT IN AND THIS WAS SORT OF SUGGESTED EARLIER -- IS THE WHOLE WORLD WATCHING HOW WE DEAL WITH THIS AND SO BASICALLY OF A LOT OF MONEY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS GAME HERE TO BUILD THIS INFRASTRUCTURE -- AND AND IF IN FACT WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING IS WE START TERMINATING CONTRACTS IN THE IN A BASED ON THOSE INVESTMENTS -- IN TERMS OF MODERNIZING IT WHAT IS THAT SAVE FOR THE FUTURE OKAY AND I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF BILLS ARE FLOAT AROUND THAT WE HAVE EVEN MORE INTERESTING NEW TECHNOLOGIES COMING. THAT TODAY ARE GOING TO BE MUCH HIGHER COSTS THAN THEY ARE TEN YEARS FROM NOW BUT IF WE GET THE REPUTATION OF THAT BASICALLY BEING ABLE TO KEEP OUR CONTRACTS. THAT'S GONNA HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT FUTURE CAPITAL FOR ALL THE OTHER WONDERFUL THINGS WE WANT TO DO -- SO I THINK THAT -- THAT THAT'S REALLY KIND OF AT THE KEY TO IT THE KEY OF WHAT WE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT TODAY IS THE IMPACTS OF THAT. ON A BROADER RANGE. HAVING SAID THAT IT'S OBVIOUSLY VERY FOCUSED I TRIED TO MAKE SURE -- WE MINIMIZE THE FIRE DAMAGE -- THIS ADULTS ALL TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW INSURANCE POOLS OTHER KINDS OF THINGS I MAY THINK YOU HEARD AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF THIS ON THEIR COMMUNITIES WE HAVE TO KIND OF WEEK THAT KIND OF FIX IS WE HAVE TO FIX THIS. AGAIN ABOUT A BROADER THINGS AND I THINK THAT WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE VERY BUSY ON THINGS THAT ARE NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE BANKRUPTCY IN TERMS OF ALL THE INTERESTING. MACHINATIONS THAT ARE HAPPENING THERE AND HAVING TO DRESS THAT AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE IN THE REST OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR. WELL I THINK IT'S BEEN VERY -- VERY HELPFUL IN TERMS OF A MOVIE HIS STRIKING FORWARD AND I THINK GATHERED THAT THIS THE FIRST STEPS THAT WERE TAKEN LAST YEAR AND SB. NOT A ONE THE COMMITTEE THAT COMMITTEES MET AYE I THINK IT'S SENDING SIGNALS THAT. EVERYONE'S TAKING IS VERY SERIOUS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ALL IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I WANNA THANK OF THAT THAT WOULD THAT WOULD ACTUALLY VERY NICE CLOSING THANK YOU JOHN -- I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU AS WELL I THINK -- THIS BANKRUPTCY WHAT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION IN TERMS OF THIS BANKRUPTCY AND THAT THE TIMELINESS OF IT IN JUST A MOMENT WAS FILED. IS THAT IT SEEMS THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY WE HAVE A UTILITY -- DECLARING BANKRUPTCY TO GET OUT OF AN OBLIGATION OF MAKING. VICTIMS HOLE AND THAT THAT WOULD BE ON PRESS AND IT WOULD. DEFINITELY. CREATE -- OF A NEW. WHICH TO THIS -- IT WOULD IT WOULD A CREATE A PRECEDENT BUT I THINK IT'S VERY DANGEROUS FOR OUR STATE'S FUTURE. IF IN THE FUTURE OUR UTILITIES GOING TO BE USING BANKRUPTCY TO GET OUT OF MAKING VICTIMS -- HOLE AND AND MY CONDOLENCES TO THE ENTIRE TOWN OF PARADISE THAT IS DEFINITELY BEEN COMPLETELY DESTROYED. FROM THIS AND AND WE SHOULDN'T AT ALL -- UP CONTINUE. TO SUSTAIN POLICIES THAT WILL DO THAT TO OTHER PARTS AND OTHER COMMUNITIES IN OUR STATE. THAT WILL DEFINITELY JUST LEAD TO A GRADUAL DESTRUCTION OF OUR ENTIRE STATE WE DO HAVE TO FIX THIS I AGREE WITH YOU. AND THAT THAT SOLUTION IS IS. VERY TENUOUS I MEAN AND TERMS OF WILL WE MOVE THIS WRECK XIN WE AFFECTS INSURANCE WHIM OF THIS DIRECTION WE AFFECT -- IN -- OF VESTER AS WE MOVE THIS TO THE DIRECTION WE WE AFFECT THE VICTIMS THERE'S VERY LITTLE ROOM FOR US TO MANEUVER. THROUGH THIS CORRECTIVE PROCESS BUT I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO WHATEVER WILL WE DO. HOPEFULLY WE'LL FOCUS ON ON ON MAKE IN -- FUTURE VICTIMS HOLE THE CURRENT VICTIMS HOLE IN THIS PROCESS. AND AND A AT LEAST SOME ENCOURAGE THAT WE HAVE THE P. UC INVOLVED IN THIS WE HAVE THE LEGISLATURE HAS SOME ROLE IN THIS. IF NOT IS AS MUCH AS ANYONE ELSE TO BE TO BE FRANK WITH YOU WE HAVE A GOOD GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS. AND THAT HOPEFULLY CAN COULD WORK TOGETHER WE NEED TO WORK-TOGETHER TO THIS PROCESS AND THERE'S A LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION. WE'RE HERE AND WILLING TO TO DO THE HEAVY LIFTING IN WHATEVER WE DO PROBABLY WON'T BE. YOUR ULTIMATELY I I HOPE WE COME UP WITH THIS WONDERFUL SOLUTION THAT EVERYBODY AGREES. TO BUT IN MY EXPERIENCE IN THIS BUILDING THAT IS. THE VERY EXTREMELY RARE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I ALSO LIKE. TO OF OPEN MIKE FOR PUBLIC COMMENTS IF WE HAVE.
