00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:37.830
ADVANCES ARE WE GOING TO HAVE TO

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:39.165
HOPE FOR THE FUTURE IN ORDER TO

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:40.666
GET THERE.

00:06:40.733 --> 00:06:41.567
THANK YOU SIR APPRECIATE THE

00:06:41.634 --> 00:06:42.802
QUESTION SO LET'S JUST START

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:45.071
WITH WHERE WE ARE NOW WE'RE AT

00:06:45.138 --> 00:06:46.906
34% RENEWABLES IN CALIFORNIA

00:06:46.973 --> 00:06:48.407
WE'VE TRIPLED RENEWABLE ENERGY

00:06:48.474 --> 00:06:50.343
PRODUCTION LAST TEN YEARS.

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:52.111
I'M SORRY WE TROUBLED RENEWABLE

00:06:52.178 --> 00:06:53.713
ENERGY PRODUCTION LAST TEN YEARS

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:54.981
IN OUR STATE WE DON'T COUNT

00:06:55.047 --> 00:06:56.849
LARGE HYDRO IS A RENEWABLE THE

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:58.251
MANY OTHER COMMITTEES DO.

00:06:58.317 --> 00:06:59.318
OF YOU HAVE LARGE HYDRO WORD

00:06:59.385 --> 00:07:01.788
ABOUT 45% TODAY IF YOU ADD THE

00:07:01.854 --> 00:07:04.257
ABLOW WE'RE ABOUT 55%.

00:07:04.323 --> 00:07:06.793
CARBON FREE TODAY SO MY VIEW IS

00:07:06.859 --> 00:07:09.929
THAT GETTING 2100% IS.

00:07:09.996 --> 00:07:11.664
A CHALLENGE BUT IT'S ABSOLUTELY

00:07:11.731 --> 00:07:13.065
A SOLVABLE CHALLENGE I THINK

00:07:13.132 --> 00:07:15.835
GETTING 280% IS RELATIVELY EASY.

00:07:15.902 --> 00:07:17.570
GETTING 9% IT'S HARD GETTING

00:07:17.637 --> 00:07:19.438
2100% IS REALLY HARD BUT THERE'S

00:07:19.505 --> 00:07:21.107
NOTHING ABOUT THAT THAT'S

00:07:21.174 --> 00:07:23.109
OUTSIDE THE REALM OF A SOLVABLE

00:07:23.176 --> 00:07:23.976
PROBLEM.

00:07:24.043 --> 00:07:25.378
AND THE TECHNOLOGIES WERE

00:07:25.444 --> 00:07:26.579
DEVELOPING NOW TO HELP

00:07:26.646 --> 00:07:28.681
MANIPULATE DEMAND WE HAVE WE'VE

00:07:28.748 --> 00:07:30.583
DONE THINGS THAT WE FUNDED.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:31.450
THIRTY SEVEN ENERGY STORAGE

00:07:31.517 --> 00:07:33.486
DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS --

00:07:33.553 --> 00:07:35.188
THERE'S ENORMOUS POTENTIAL SO A

00:07:35.254 --> 00:07:36.589
LOT OF OTHER STATES ARE WATCHING

00:07:36.656 --> 00:07:40.059
WHAT WE DO AND IN FACT ON THE

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:41.994
100% -- WE NOW HAVE THAT IN LAW

00:07:42.061 --> 00:07:43.529
IN NEW MEXICO AND DISTRICT OF

00:07:43.596 --> 00:07:45.498
COLUMBIA IN A WHITE EIGHT OTHER

00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:47.099
STATES HAVE INTRODUCED THAT

00:07:47.166 --> 00:07:48.501
LEGISLATION -- WHERE TWENTY

00:07:48.568 --> 00:07:49.735
THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE'S

00:07:49.802 --> 00:07:51.838
ANOTHER FOUR HAVE INTRODUCED

00:07:51.904 --> 00:07:53.906
LEGISLATION TO STUDY IT -- SO

00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:55.441
WE'RE BEING WATCHED CLOSELY I AM

00:07:55.508 --> 00:07:56.976
VERY OPTIMISTIC BECAUSE WE'VE

00:07:57.043 --> 00:07:59.212
SEEN ENORMOUS COST REDUCTION

00:07:59.278 --> 00:07:59.745
WHEN I GOT INTO THE SOLAR

00:07:59.812 --> 00:08:02.582
INDUSTRY. TWENTY YEARS AGO -- IT

00:08:02.648 --> 00:08:04.050
WAS FIFTY CENTS A KILOWATT HOUR

00:08:04.116 --> 00:08:05.651
WE ARE FIRST BID IN CALIFORNIA

00:08:05.718 --> 00:08:07.353
LAST SUMMER -- UNDER TWO CENTS A

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:11.324
pWITH COST REDUCTION SO I'M VERY

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:14.427
OPTIMISTIC WE CAN MEET THE TEST.

00:08:14.493 --> 00:08:16.162
ARE THE IS IS STORAGE THE

00:08:16.229 --> 00:08:17.530
LIMITING FACTOR.

00:08:17.597 --> 00:08:18.798
WELL SO IT'S A DAY TO THINK

00:08:18.865 --> 00:08:20.633
ABOUT IT IT'S NOT LIKE US ONE

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:21.701
SILVER BULLET SOLUTION IT'S

00:08:21.767 --> 00:08:23.436
REALLY SILVER BUCKSHOT STORAGE

00:08:23.502 --> 00:08:25.137
IS ONE OF THE THINGS YOU NEED.

00:08:25.204 --> 00:08:26.672
YOU NEED INTELLIGENT ELECTRIC

00:08:26.739 --> 00:08:28.307
VEHICLE CHARGING PROTOCOLS WE

00:08:28.374 --> 00:08:29.675
WANT TO HAVE WHAT I CALL AN

00:08:29.742 --> 00:08:31.043
EEVEE HAPPY HOUR WHERE THEY'RE

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:33.145
PLUGGED IN TO THE GRID WHEN WE

00:08:33.212 --> 00:08:33.946
HAVE SURPLUS RENEWABLE ENERGY

00:08:34.013 --> 00:08:34.981
GENERATION.

00:08:35.047 --> 00:08:36.048
THERE'S DEMAND RESPONSE TO BE

00:08:36.115 --> 00:08:37.550
ABLE TO THERE'S THINGS LIKE PRE

00:08:37.617 --> 00:08:38.784
COOLING BUILDINGS ANOTHER LOAD

00:08:38.851 --> 00:08:40.586
THAT'S FLEXIBLE -- YOU LOOK AT

00:08:40.653 --> 00:08:42.855
THE NEXT WAVE OF TRANSPORTATION

00:08:42.922 --> 00:08:43.789
IT'S COMING ELECTRIC SCHOOL

00:08:43.856 --> 00:08:45.758
BUSES ARE AN ENORMOUS ASSET

00:08:45.825 --> 00:08:46.926
BECAUSE THEY'RE ACTUALLY PLUGGED

00:08:46.993 --> 00:08:47.193
IN.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.028
A TO THE GRID -- DURING THE

00:08:49.095 --> 00:08:50.029
MIDDLE OF THE DAY WHEN WE HAVE

00:08:50.096 --> 00:08:51.831
SURPLUS RENEWABLES ALL THESE

00:08:51.898 --> 00:08:52.798
THINGS.

00:08:52.865 --> 00:08:54.166
TAKEN TOGETHER ARE HOW WE HOW

00:08:54.233 --> 00:08:56.869
WAS AND ALSO AS A DIVERSITY OF

00:08:56.936 --> 00:08:58.371
RENEWABLE ENERGIES ENERGY SOURCE

00:08:58.437 --> 00:09:00.239
OF WE DON'T WANT ALL SOLAR WE

00:09:00.306 --> 00:09:02.208
WANT -- GEOTHERMAL AND BIOMASS

00:09:02.275 --> 00:09:06.279
AND OFFSHORE WIND AND ALL THE

00:09:06.345 --> 00:09:07.346
REST.

00:09:07.413 --> 00:09:07.947
THE IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THE

00:09:08.014 --> 00:09:09.181
AIR RESOURCES BOARD IS.

00:09:09.248 --> 00:09:11.550
GOING TO BE -- HEAVILY FOCUSED

00:09:11.617 --> 00:09:13.552
ON HEAVY DUTY TRUCK --

00:09:13.619 --> 00:09:16.656
TECHNOLOGIES HOW HOW DOES THE

00:09:16.722 --> 00:09:18.357
ENERGY COMMISSION INTERFACE WITH

00:09:18.424 --> 00:09:20.459
THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD ON THAT

00:09:20.526 --> 00:09:21.894
PARTICULAR SUBJECT IF AT ALL.

00:09:21.961 --> 00:09:23.229
SO WE HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP

00:09:23.296 --> 00:09:24.830
WITH THEM WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH

00:09:24.897 --> 00:09:26.032
THEM WE GIVE AWAY ABOUT A

00:09:26.098 --> 00:09:27.667
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR

00:09:27.733 --> 00:09:29.669
TO SUPPORT CLEAN TRANSPORTATION

00:09:29.735 --> 00:09:32.705
AND PARTNER WITH THEM -- WE HAVE

00:09:32.772 --> 00:09:34.240
FUNDED SOME HEAVY DUTY.

00:09:34.307 --> 00:09:36.008
VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE AND OTHER

00:09:36.075 --> 00:09:38.411
TECHNOLOGIES AND ACTUALLY THE

00:09:38.477 --> 00:09:39.912
NEW COMMISSIONER WHO'S COMING IN

00:09:39.979 --> 00:09:41.113
COMMISSIONER MONAGHAN WILL BE

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:42.648
THE LEAD FOR THAT SHE'S GOT

00:09:42.715 --> 00:09:44.150
TWENTY YEARS OF BACKGROUND -- IN

00:09:44.216 --> 00:09:46.152
TRANSPORTATION OUR CURRENT VICE

00:09:46.218 --> 00:09:47.353
CHAIR JIMMY SCOTT'S TO THE

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.287
TREMENDOUS JOB LEADING THAT

00:09:48.354 --> 00:09:49.722
EFFORT BUT IT'S AN ISSUE BY

00:09:49.789 --> 00:09:52.124
ISSUE -- COORDINATION WITH THEM.

00:09:52.191 --> 00:09:54.927
THANK YOU SIR CONGRATULATIONS

00:09:54.994 --> 00:09:55.561
AGAIN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND

00:09:55.628 --> 00:09:56.395
CONSIDER.

00:09:56.462 --> 00:09:58.364
YOU VERY MUCH MR VICE CHAIRMAN

00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:01.267
YOU WANT TO GO NEXT.

00:10:01.334 --> 00:10:04.804
SURE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:06.372
SO I KNOW I DON'T NORMALLY ASK

00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:07.206
QUESTIONS THAT I HAD ALREADY

00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:08.808
DONE IN PRIVATE I WAS A LITTLE

00:10:08.874 --> 00:10:10.076
UNDER THE WEATHER WHEN WE MET SO

00:10:10.142 --> 00:10:12.311
SOME STUFF POPPED UP SINCE I

00:10:12.378 --> 00:10:12.945
KNOW YOU CAN HANDLE SO IT'S NOT

00:10:13.012 --> 00:10:14.180
A BIG DEAL.

00:10:14.246 --> 00:10:17.650
SO I HYDROGEN CARS.

00:10:17.717 --> 00:10:19.218
I'VE DRIVEN I HAD DRIVEN AND

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:20.920
THEY'RE VERY IMPRESSIVE BUT

00:10:20.987 --> 00:10:21.354
THERE'S THERE'S NO

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:23.489
INFRASTRUCTURE -- YOU SEE IF YOU

00:10:23.556 --> 00:10:25.458
TURN HYDROGEN CARS AND IF SO

00:10:25.524 --> 00:10:27.526
WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO TO MAKE

00:10:27.593 --> 00:10:28.794
THAT A REALITY.

00:10:28.861 --> 00:10:30.363
SO THERE IS A STATE GOAL WHICH

00:10:30.429 --> 00:10:31.931
IS TWO HUNDRED HYDROGEN FUELING

00:10:31.998 --> 00:10:33.065
STATIONS.

00:10:33.132 --> 00:10:34.467
I WILL SAY YOU KNOW THE MOMENTUM

00:10:34.533 --> 00:10:36.102
IN THE INVESTMENT AMONG

00:10:36.168 --> 00:10:37.903
AUTOMAKERS NOW SHIFTED.

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:39.972
THAT TEND TO ONE FOR ELECTRIC

00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:41.607
VEHICLES VERSUS HYDROGEN CARS.

00:10:41.674 --> 00:10:44.243
WE HAVE ABOUT FIVE AND FIFTY

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:44.877
THOUSAND ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN

00:10:44.944 --> 00:10:46.879
THE STATE AND SIX THOUSAND HI

00:10:46.946 --> 00:10:48.381
GIN FUEL CELL PASSENGER VEHICLES.

00:10:48.447 --> 00:10:51.217
ARE JUST TO BE TOTALLY CANDID I

00:10:51.283 --> 00:10:53.085
THINK THE SHIP HAS SAILED IN

00:10:53.152 --> 00:10:54.553
TERMS OF PASSENGER VEHICLES I

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.188
THINK THE THE MOMENTUM IS VERY

00:10:56.255 --> 00:10:57.056
CLEARLY.

00:10:57.123 --> 00:10:58.491
TOWARDS ELECTRIC I THINK THE

00:10:58.557 --> 00:11:00.693
NIECE HYDROGEN IS BEST SUITED

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.228
FOR US REALLY AND HEAVY DUTY

00:11:02.294 --> 00:11:04.730
TRUCKING -- AND AND AROUND PORTS

00:11:04.797 --> 00:11:08.034
AND SO FORTH AND SO WE'VE BEEN

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:08.634
FINDING SOME SOME WORK IN THAT

00:11:08.701 --> 00:11:08.834
AREA.

00:11:08.901 --> 00:11:09.402
A GREAT.

00:11:09.468 --> 00:11:11.003
SO I MEAN HISTORY APPOINTMENTS

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:12.538
I'M JUST CURIOUS WHAT DO YOU SEE

00:11:12.605 --> 00:11:14.340
AS THE HIGHLIGHTS OF YOUR FIRST

00:11:14.407 --> 00:11:15.207
TERM.

00:11:15.274 --> 00:11:16.675
IN MAY AND WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR

00:11:16.742 --> 00:11:18.044
GOALS FOR THE SECOND TERM IT

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:19.412
MAYBE TOUCH ON BECAUSE I THINK

00:11:19.478 --> 00:11:20.546
THE WAY WE'RE GOING TO ATTACK

00:11:20.613 --> 00:11:21.347
CLIMATE CHANGE THROUGH

00:11:21.414 --> 00:11:22.314
INNOVATION AND YOU SURE SOME

00:11:22.381 --> 00:11:23.883
VERY INTERESTING THINGS WITH ME

00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:25.151
AT THE OTHER DAY SO.

00:11:25.217 --> 00:11:26.085
YOU COULD TOUCH ON THOSE I'D

00:11:26.152 --> 00:11:27.353
APPRECIATE YOUR FIRST WITH THE

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.421
CHALLENGES I WOULD SAY THE P.

00:11:28.487 --> 00:11:29.488
GINNY.

00:11:29.555 --> 00:11:30.790
BANKRUPTCY IS A COLOSSAL

00:11:30.856 --> 00:11:32.658
CHALLENGE AND THE PROSPECT OF

00:11:32.725 --> 00:11:34.293
ELECTRIC RATES SICK IN

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.928
INCREASING SIGNIFICANTLY IS A

00:11:35.995 --> 00:11:37.863
MAJOR CONCERN ELECTRIC RATES

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:40.066
THEMSELVES TODAY OUR CLIMATE

00:11:40.132 --> 00:11:41.200
POLICY.

00:11:41.267 --> 00:11:43.436
BECAUSE IT'S THE CASE TODAY

00:11:43.502 --> 00:11:45.371
EVERYWHERE IN EVERY ELECTRIC

00:11:45.438 --> 00:11:46.906
SERVICE TERRITORY IN CALIFORNIA

00:11:46.972 --> 00:11:49.442
IT'S CHEAPER. TO DRIVE A MILE ON

00:11:49.508 --> 00:11:51.010
ELECTRIC CAR THAN IT IS FROM

00:11:51.077 --> 00:11:52.378
INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE.

00:11:52.445 --> 00:11:54.413
ELECTRIC RATES DOUBLING UP 80%

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.082
THAT'S NO LONGER THE CASE IT'S

00:11:56.148 --> 00:11:57.483
CHEAPER EVERYWHERE IN CALIFORNIA

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.753
TO HEAT YOUR WATER WITH ELECTRIC

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:01.353
HEAT PUMP WATER HEATER THAT'S

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:02.755
CLEAN -- THEN IT IS A NATURAL

00:12:02.822 --> 00:12:04.723
GAS WATER THAT'S NOT THE CASE OF

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:06.358
ELECTRIC RATES GO UP SO FINDING

00:12:06.425 --> 00:12:08.694
A WAY THROUGH THIS P. GINNY.

00:12:08.761 --> 00:12:11.564
SITUATION IN A WAYTHAT DOESN'T --

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:13.132
ADVERSELY IMPACT ELECTRIC RATES

00:12:13.199 --> 00:12:14.500
IS PARAMOUNT NOT JUST TO THE

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:15.734
BETTER THE RATE PAYERS BUT TO

00:12:15.801 --> 00:12:17.136
THE BENEFIT.

00:12:17.203 --> 00:12:19.038
OF OUR CLIMATE GOALS -- WITH

00:12:19.105 --> 00:12:20.339
RESPECT TO WHERE THE ENERGY

00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:21.407
COMMISSION IS COME I AM.

00:12:21.474 --> 00:12:23.409
REALLY PROUD OF THE PROGRESS

00:12:23.476 --> 00:12:24.710
WE'VE MADE I MEAN I I'VE JUST

00:12:24.777 --> 00:12:26.245
FINISHED DOING A DEEP DIVE

00:12:26.312 --> 00:12:27.646
DIVISION REVIEW.

00:12:27.713 --> 00:12:30.182
WITH -- ALL OF OUR DIVISIONS --

00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:32.218
WE GAVE OUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

00:12:32.284 --> 00:12:33.752
DOLLARS LAST YEAR.

00:12:33.819 --> 00:12:34.887
ON AND TELL ME THE LEVEL OF

IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DAYS

00:13:19.832 --> 00:13:21.333
ELECTRIC VEHICLE FACTORY TESLA.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.835
I WORKED ACROSS THE STREET FROM

00:13:22.902 --> 00:13:23.736
THEIR WEIGHT WHEN I WAS IN

THE GM FACTORY AND TESSA PLACE

00:13:27.673 --> 00:13:29.808
TWICE AS MANY PEOPLE THAT SITE --

00:13:29.875 --> 00:13:33.345
AS WINNERS JIM SO THE POTENTIAL

00:13:33.412 --> 00:13:34.713
TO GO BIG IS THERE -- BUT THE

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:36.215
YOU KNOW THE PHILOSOPHY WE HAVE

00:13:36.282 --> 00:13:37.516
TO FOLLOW IS WHAT I CALL THE

00:13:37.583 --> 00:13:39.285
PHILOSOPHY OF SUSTAINED ORDERLY

00:13:39.351 --> 00:13:41.754
DEVELOPMENT WHERE YOU SET LONG

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.522

NOW HAVE SP ONE HUNDREDS OF

00:13:45.191 --> 00:13:47.026
FOUNDATIONAL POLICY -- ALONG

00:13:47.092 --> 00:13:48.761
WITH MANY OTHERS -- AND GET AWAY

00:13:48.827 --> 00:13:50.262
FROM THE EARLY MISTAKES THAT WE

00:13:50.329 --> 00:13:52.064
MADE WHICH HAD TO DO WITH HAVING

00:13:52.131 --> 00:13:53.732
AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM TO LAST FOR

00:13:53.799 --> 00:13:55.201
ONE YEAR AND THEN COLLAPSES AND

00:13:55.267 --> 00:13:56.769
GETS RESTARTED YOU CAN'T.

00:13:56.835 --> 00:13:58.237
BUILD A COMPANY YOU CAN'T PLAN

00:13:58.304 --> 00:13:59.905
YOU CAN'T GROW WITH THAT I THINK

00:13:59.972 --> 00:14:01.874
WE'VE LEARNED THAT LESSON AND

00:14:01.941 --> 00:14:02.441

IT'S A SUCH A IS EXTREMELY

00:14:28.834 --> 00:14:30.169
IMPORTANT THING IS WE ARE

00:14:30.236 --> 00:14:31.770
APPROACHING ARE THE ISSUES

00:14:31.837 --> 00:14:33.606
REGARDING OUR CLIMATE CHANGE ONE

00:14:33.672 --> 00:14:34.974
QUESTION ON NOW THAT'S ALL I

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.242

ABOUT DIVERSIFICATION IN TERMS

00:14:39.211 --> 00:14:40.946
OF HOW WE PRODUCE OUR ENERGY.

00:14:41.013 --> 00:14:43.349
BUT ARE THE FOLDER ISSUE WHICH

00:14:43.415 --> 00:14:44.650
WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON I

00:14:44.717 --> 00:14:46.018
DIDN'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

ASK YOU HOW YOU ARE ADDRESSING

00:14:47.786 --> 00:14:49.021
THE CONCERN.

00:14:49.088 --> 00:14:50.589
THAT'S BEGINNING ON IN THIS

00:14:50.656 --> 00:14:52.691
GENERATION REGARDING HOW WE

00:14:52.758 --> 00:14:54.526
DISPOSE OF THE SOLAR PANELS ARE

00:14:54.593 --> 00:14:56.428
BECAUSE THEY HAVE THEY ARE

00:14:56.495 --> 00:14:57.896
SPECIFIC LIFE CYCLE.

00:14:57.963 --> 00:15:00.132
AND THERE IS A CONCERN THAT WE

00:15:00.199 --> 00:15:01.367
HAVE NOT ADDRESSED THAT IN

00:15:01.433 --> 00:15:03.669
PROBABLY EARLIER IS BETTER.

00:15:03.736 --> 00:15:04.737
OUR WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT I

00:15:04.803 --> 00:15:07.506
THINK COMES THING FIVE HUNDRED

00:15:07.573 --> 00:15:08.907
THOUSAND ARE COMING ON WITHIN

00:15:08.974 --> 00:15:10.142
THE TWENTY YEAR LIFESPAN OF A

00:15:10.209 --> 00:15:11.310
SOLAR PANEL.

00:15:11.377 --> 00:15:12.578
ANY THOUGHTS ON MATTERS THAT

00:15:12.645 --> 00:15:18.250
WOULD THAT BE ON YOUR TO DO LIST

00:15:18.317 --> 00:15:20.019
ISSUE -- YOU KNOW.

00:15:20.085 --> 00:15:20.919
YEAH SWORN IN AND THEN START

00:15:20.986 --> 00:15:22.054
YOUR OWN YOUR OWN PROGRAM YOUR

00:15:22.121 --> 00:15:22.955
YOUR WORK PROGRAM THANK YOU FOR

00:15:23.022 --> 00:15:24.323
THE QUESTION I SHOULD NOTE -- IN

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:24.990
A FEW WEEKS WE'RE GONNA BE

00:15:25.057 --> 00:15:26.625
MARKING -- THE OCCASION OF

00:15:26.692 --> 00:15:28.994
CALIFORNIA HITTING ONE MILLION --

00:15:29.061 --> 00:15:32.097
SOLAR ROOF TOPS -- AND BOB

00:15:32.164 --> 00:15:33.632
RUMORS HERE WITH US AS WELL AND

00:15:33.699 --> 00:15:35.200
THE AUDIENCE THE CALIFORNIA

00:15:35.267 --> 00:15:36.402
BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATIONS

00:15:36.468 --> 00:15:37.936
BEEN VERY INVOLVED IN THE SOLAR

00:15:38.003 --> 00:15:41.073
NEW CONSTRUCTION SPACE -- SO

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:43.208
LOOK AT SOLAR PANELS -- HAVE A

00:15:43.275 --> 00:15:44.243
TWENTY FIVE YEAR WARRANTY THE

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:45.444
ACTUAL LIFE CYCLE IS

00:15:45.511 --> 00:15:47.212
CONSIDERABLY LONGER THAN THAT

00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:48.614
THE MATERIALS INSIDE THE SOLAR

00:15:48.681 --> 00:15:49.581
PANEL.

00:15:49.648 --> 00:15:51.517
THE SILICON THE EVA THE BAKSHI

00:15:51.583 --> 00:15:53.385
THE JUNCTION BOX THE GLASS THE

00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:54.953
FRAMES ARE VERY DURABLE THERE

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.156
BEEN SOLD HILLS IN OPERATION FOR

00:15:57.222 --> 00:16:00.059
IN EXCESS OF SIXTY YEARS -- THEY

00:16:00.125 --> 00:16:02.161
DIMINISH DOWN ABOUT 80% OF THEIR

00:16:02.227 --> 00:16:03.729
NAMEPLATE RATING AFTER TWENTY

00:16:03.796 --> 00:16:05.230
FIVE YEARS AND THEN TEND TO STAY

00:16:05.297 --> 00:16:06.732
AT ROUGHLY THAT OUTPUT.

00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:09.001
SO THEY ACTUALLY WILL HAVE A

00:16:09.068 --> 00:16:10.869
CONSIDERABLY LONGER LIFE -- THE

00:16:10.936 --> 00:16:14.173
MATERIALS ARE ALL RECYCLABLE --

00:16:14.239 --> 00:16:16.308
AND YOU KNOW I THINK ALONG WITH

00:16:16.375 --> 00:16:17.676
THE EVERY OTHER MATERIAL AND

00:16:17.743 --> 00:16:18.977
THAT'S ONLY GOING TO DEAL WITH

00:16:19.044 --> 00:16:22.481
AT THAT TIME BUT I DON'T.

00:16:22.548 --> 00:16:25.417
YEAH I DON'T SEE THAT THERE IS A

00:16:25.484 --> 00:16:26.051
HUGE CHALLENGE.

00:16:26.118 --> 00:16:26.652
I JUST THINK IT CAME FORWARD

00:16:26.719 --> 00:16:28.320
BECAUSE WE'RE HAVING ISSUES WITH

00:16:28.387 --> 00:16:30.189
RECYCLABLES AND THE WHOLE

00:16:30.255 --> 00:16:32.391
RECYCLING INDUSTRY SO.

00:16:32.458 --> 00:16:32.891
IT IS SOMETHING THAT'S

00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:34.727
INTERESTING -- THAT'S ACTUALLY

00:16:34.793 --> 00:16:36.195
NEW INFORMATION CAUSES A LONGER

00:16:36.261 --> 00:16:38.030
LIFE CYCLE YES A LOT MORE TIME

00:16:38.097 --> 00:16:39.631
SO WE DON'T HAVE TO CONTEMPLATE

00:16:39.698 --> 00:16:41.133
LET'S SAY A FEE RIGHT NOW.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.901

CALIFORNIA SET TO DECOMMISSION.

00:17:52.805 --> 00:17:54.673
WE TALKED SOME ABOUT PROSPECTS

ALONG CALIFORNIA'S COAST FOR THE

00:17:57.976 --> 00:17:59.878
DEVELOPMENT OF WIND ENERGY.

00:17:59.945 --> 00:18:01.280
WHAT ARE THE OPPORTUNITIES THERE

00:18:01.346 --> 00:18:04.216

REALLY EXCITED AND OPTIMISTIC

00:18:15.661 --> 00:18:17.129
ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OFFSHORE

00:18:17.196 --> 00:18:19.131
WIND JUST TO PUT IT IN CONTEXT

00:18:19.198 --> 00:18:21.366
WIND ON LAND IN CALIFORNIA

00:18:21.433 --> 00:18:22.935
GENERATES ELECTRICITY.

00:18:23.001 --> 00:18:24.703
ABOUT 35% OF THE HOURS OF THE

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:28.173
DAY OFFSHORE WIND IS APPROACHING

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.174
60%.

00:18:29.241 --> 00:18:31.210
AND THE RESOURCES IS ENORMOUS

00:18:31.276 --> 00:18:33.345
IT'S ALSO HIGHLY COMPLIMENTARY

00:18:33.412 --> 00:18:34.780
IN THE GENERATION PROFILE TO

00:18:34.847 --> 00:18:36.648
SOLAR SOFTER WHEN IT'S UP IN THE

00:18:36.715 --> 00:18:37.015
MORNING.

00:18:37.082 --> 00:18:38.517
DOWN THE MIDDLE THE DAY COMES UP

IN THE AFTERNOON EVENING.

00:18:39.918 --> 00:18:42.154
AND THE SIZE OF THE TURBINES IS

00:18:42.221 --> 00:18:43.889
SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER SO ON LAND

00:18:43.956 --> 00:18:45.390
IT'S TYPICALLY ABOUT TWO

00:18:45.457 --> 00:18:47.860
MEGAWATTS OFF SURE THE ENTIRE

00:18:47.926 --> 00:18:48.627
INDUSTRY IS GOING TO TWELVE MIKE

00:18:48.694 --> 00:18:50.462
WANTS. TO PUT THAT IN

00:18:50.529 --> 00:18:52.564
PERSPECTIVE. FIFTEEN RPM SO IT'S

00:18:52.631 --> 00:18:56.435
ONE ROTATION EVERY FOUR SECONDS

00:18:56.502 --> 00:18:58.170
OF THE TURBINE TOWERS A HOUSE

00:18:58.237 --> 00:18:59.972
FOR A DAY THAT'S THE SKILL THAT

THREE MILES THAT'S SOME OF THE

00:20:05.003 --> 00:20:06.505
LATER LIVED IN TERMS OF NOT

00:20:08.674 --> 00:20:10.375
DEAL IN FEDERAL WATERS.

00:20:10.442 --> 00:20:10.943
IT IS LEASED BY THE FEDERAL

00:20:11.009 --> 00:20:13.245

I BELIEVE THERE'S A PATH FORWARD

00:20:18.383 --> 00:20:20.085
THERE AND WE CAN FIND A COMMON

00:20:20.152 --> 00:20:21.954
GROUND THAT MEETS THEIR CONCERNS

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:24.156

FORESTRY IN HELPING. TO BE A

00:56:03.827 --> 00:56:07.797
LEADER IN -- I WOULD SAY CULTURE

00:56:07.864 --> 00:56:11.067
CHANGE IN FOREST MANAGEMENT OF

00:56:11.134 --> 00:56:12.836
LEARNING IN LEADING A PROCESS

00:56:12.902 --> 00:56:15.071
THAT'S POST GOOD.

00:56:15.138 --> 00:56:16.940
FOR THE FORESTRY INDUSTRY AND

00:56:17.006 --> 00:56:18.141
GOOD FOR OUR ENVIRONMENT AND

00:56:18.208 --> 00:56:21.745
ECOLOGY AND I THINK YOU AN

00:56:21.811 --> 00:56:23.680
APOLOGY FOR THAT LEADERSHIP.

WITH RESPECT TO THIS POSITION --

00:56:26.583 --> 00:56:29.252
YOU REFERENCED BIG CHALLENGES AS

00:56:29.319 --> 00:56:30.487
GOVERNOR BROWN SAID WE'RE LIVING

00:56:30.553 --> 00:56:32.522
IN A NEW ABNORMAL WITH CLIMATE

00:56:32.589 --> 00:56:33.757
CHANGE IN.

00:56:33.823 --> 00:56:36.760
FIRE SEASONS BEING EXTENDED.

00:56:36.826 --> 00:56:39.996
QWERTY WITH WITH THE THE BREADTH

00:56:40.063 --> 00:56:41.564
OF THESE CHALLENGES.

00:56:41.631 --> 00:56:44.067
WHERE WHERE OUR ENERGIES BEST

00:56:44.134 --> 00:56:45.168
DIRECTED I KNOW THERE'S NOT A

00:56:45.235 --> 00:56:47.904
SINGLE FIX BUT WE HAVE THE

00:56:47.971 --> 00:56:49.539
INTERFACE BETWEEN?

00:56:49.606 --> 00:56:51.574
POPULATED AREAS SOME WILD FIRE

00:56:51.641 --> 00:56:54.911
AREAS WE HAVE LARGE FORCE MANY

00:56:54.978 --> 00:56:57.180
OF WHICH ARE US FORESTRY.

00:56:57.247 --> 00:56:59.249
MANAGED OM WHERE DO WE FIND THAT

00:56:59.315 --> 00:57:02.352
BALANCE AS YOU MOVE FORWARD --

00:57:02.418 --> 00:57:05.155
WHERE DO YOU WANT TO SEE THE

00:57:05.221 --> 00:57:06.956
STATE PUT ITS ATTENTION?

00:57:07.023 --> 00:57:09.292
IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO DO

00:57:09.359 --> 00:57:11.795
A MULTI PRONGED ATTACK AT THIS

00:57:11.861 --> 00:57:14.531
WE WON'T GET THE WORK DONE THAT

00:57:14.597 --> 00:57:17.300
WE NEED TO DO OTHERWISE

00:57:17.367 --> 00:57:17.600
[inaudible]

00:57:17.667 --> 00:57:21.271
FIRST WE HAVE TO ENGAGE WITH THE

00:57:21.337 --> 00:57:23.273
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THEY

00:57:23.339 --> 00:57:25.074
CONTROL A LOT OF FOREST LAND.

00:57:25.141 --> 00:57:26.876
IN THE STATE.

00:57:26.943 --> 00:57:29.913
THE SECOND IS WE HAVE TO INVEST

00:57:29.979 --> 00:57:33.149
IN INFRASTRUCTURE IN TWO FORMS.

00:57:33.216 --> 00:57:34.784
WE DON'T HAVE THE INDUSTRY THAT

00:57:34.851 --> 00:57:36.486
WE ONCE HAD HERE IN CALIFORNIA

00:57:36.553 --> 00:57:38.988
OF TRAINED WORKERS TO GO OUT AND

00:57:39.055 --> 00:57:40.190
DO THE KIND OF WORK.

00:57:40.256 --> 00:57:41.624
THAT AT LEAST PART OF THE

00:57:41.691 --> 00:57:44.394
EQUATION IS ACTUALLY GETTING ON

00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:44.727
THE LANDSCAPE.

00:57:44.794 --> 00:57:47.397
AND DOING THINGS MUSICALLY WITH

00:57:47.463 --> 00:57:48.998
THE FOREST.

00:57:49.065 --> 00:57:52.502
SO GETTING PROGRAMS RESTARTED I

00:57:52.569 --> 00:57:53.803
THINK WORKING WITH COMMUNITY

00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:55.772
COLLEGES TO BRING PEOPLE INTO

00:57:55.839 --> 00:57:57.173
OUR INDUSTRY.

00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:59.742
IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL I THINK

00:57:59.809 --> 00:58:01.511
CAL FIRE IS MADE SOME INCREDIBLY

00:58:01.578 --> 00:58:04.013
GREAT STEPS RECENTLY.

00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:06.449
OF GETTING PEOPLE INTO TRAINING

00:58:06.516 --> 00:58:07.283
PROGRAMS.

00:58:07.350 --> 00:58:10.320
BROAD VARIETY OF TRAINING.

00:58:10.386 --> 00:58:11.988
THAT WILL HELP THAT ALONG.

00:58:12.055 --> 00:58:14.424
THEN THE OTHER HARD INVESTMENT

00:58:14.490 --> 00:58:17.093
IN EQUIPMENT THAT IS NECESSARY

00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:19.762
TO DO THE WORK -- AND ALSO AGAIN

00:58:19.829 --> 00:58:20.697
CHARLIE.

00:58:20.763 --> 00:58:23.333
BUILDING BACK INFRASTRUCTURE

00:58:23.399 --> 00:58:26.002
HARD IN THE STRUCTURE MILLS.

00:58:26.069 --> 00:58:28.137
COGENERATION PLANTS THAT SHOULD

00:58:28.204 --> 00:58:33.376
FOLD INTO THE RENEWABLE WINDOW --

00:58:33.443 --> 00:58:35.445
IS THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE.

00:58:35.511 --> 00:58:37.614
SOME.

00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:40.583
GUARANTEES AT LEAST.

00:58:40.650 --> 00:58:42.886
POLICY GUARANTEES THAT THE

00:58:42.952 --> 00:58:45.221
MATERIAL THAT WILL RUN THOSE

00:58:45.288 --> 00:58:48.524
FACTORIES AND HIRE THOSE PEOPLE.

00:58:48.591 --> 00:58:50.360
IS GOING TO BE THEIR LONG TERM

00:58:50.426 --> 00:58:51.561
AND NOT JUST A SHORT SPLASH IN

00:58:51.628 --> 00:58:52.862
THE PAN.

00:58:52.929 --> 00:58:55.131
SO THERE'S THAT ONCE WE GET THAT

00:58:55.198 --> 00:58:56.032
ESTABLISH I THINK [inaudible]

00:58:56.099 --> 00:58:57.400
THEN.

00:58:57.467 --> 00:58:58.935
THE THE WORK.

00:58:59.002 --> 00:59:01.037
ON THE LANDSCAPE.

00:59:01.104 --> 00:59:03.606
WILL ACCELERATES SLOWLY IT'LL BE

00:59:03.673 --> 00:59:05.575
SUBSIDIZED EARLY ON BY THE STATE

00:59:05.642 --> 00:59:07.644
BUT I THINK PRIVATE CAPITAL WILL

00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:09.312
COME INTO PLAY.

00:59:09.379 --> 00:59:11.080
THANK YOU AND THEN.

00:59:11.147 --> 00:59:13.549
AND JUST A FINAL QUESTION FOR ME

00:59:13.616 --> 00:59:16.119
I KNOW THAT THE BOARD STAFF HAS

00:59:16.185 --> 00:59:17.654
OVERSIGHT OF WORKING WITH LOCAL

00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:20.790
JURISDICTIONS IN REVIEWING.

00:59:20.857 --> 00:59:23.359
LOCAL PLANS -- FOR WILD FIRE

00:59:23.426 --> 00:59:26.562
SAFETY AND PROTECTION BUT NO

00:59:26.629 --> 00:59:28.898
AUTHORITY FOR IN TERMS OF

00:59:28.965 --> 00:59:32.702
ENFORCEMENT OR MAY BE FINE

00:59:32.769 --> 00:59:34.170
TUNING THOSE PLANS HOW.

00:59:34.237 --> 00:59:35.672
HOW DO YOU SEE THAT STATE OF

00:59:35.738 --> 00:59:37.006
PLAY IN?

00:59:37.073 --> 00:59:38.942
DO YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY

00:59:39.008 --> 00:59:40.310
NECESSARY.

00:59:40.376 --> 00:59:42.512
TO ACHIEVE MAXIMUM ANA LOCAL.

00:59:42.578 --> 00:59:46.282
INVOLVEMENT.

00:59:46.349 --> 00:59:49.385
WE HAVE WE HAVE THE OVERSIGHT.

00:59:49.452 --> 00:59:51.087
OF THE LOCAL PLANS.

00:59:51.154 --> 00:59:53.723
WE CAN MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS.

00:59:53.790 --> 00:59:57.260
BUT THEY DON'T ALWAYS HAVE.

00:59:57.327 --> 00:59:58.962
TO TAKE THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT

00:59:59.028 --> 01:00:00.596
WE MAY.

01:00:00.663 --> 01:00:02.231
I WOULD BE HESITANT AT THIS

01:00:02.298 --> 01:00:08.037
POINT IN TIME. TO USE THE STICK.

01:00:08.104 --> 01:00:09.439
VERSUS THE CARROT.

01:00:09.505 --> 01:00:12.842
AND SO I THINK AGAIN WITH SOME

01:00:12.909 --> 01:00:13.142
[inaudible]

01:00:13.209 --> 01:00:14.978
EDUCATION.

01:00:15.044 --> 01:00:17.780
I'M AND WITH THE INCREDIBLE

01:00:17.847 --> 01:00:19.082
STAFF THAT WE HAVE AT THE BOARD

01:00:19.148 --> 01:00:20.683
OF FORESTRY.

01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:23.086
THAT INTERFACES WITH COUNTIES IN

01:00:23.152 --> 01:00:25.655
PLANNING DEPARTMENTS --

01:00:25.722 --> 01:00:28.358
INCENTIVIZING.

01:00:28.424 --> 01:00:31.661
THINGS THAT THEY SHOULD SUPPORT.

01:00:31.728 --> 01:00:34.430
AND PUT INTO CODE IS THE BEST

01:00:34.497 --> 01:00:36.165

MOVING FORWARD.

01:00:52.382 --> 01:00:54.684
