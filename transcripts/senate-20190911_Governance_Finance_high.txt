CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME IN SAN DIEGO KNOW THAT IT'S A REALLY VERY PROUD REGION IT'S AT. HOME TO A VERY THRIVING MILITARY COMMUNITY A VERY ATTRACTIVE TOURISM INDUSTRY. DIVERSE INDUSTRIAL ECONOMY FROM BREWING TO BY A MEDICAL TO. HEALTH AND TO A HIGH TECH. THE REGION'S HOME TO ABOUT THREE POINT THREE MILLION PEOPLE. AND A BUS TO TURN THIRTY PLUS BILLION DOLLAR REGIONAL ECONOMY. HOWEVER JOHN THE FLIP SIDE SENATE REGION'S ALSO IT'S THE- WILL END OF A VERY LONG WATER PIPELINE IN THE STATE BECAUSE OF A LACK OF PLENTIFUL WATER SUPPLY OPTIONS THERE THE REGION'S FREQUENTLY SUBJECT TO A PROLONGED DROUGHT AND DROUGHT IS THE ENEMY OF A THRIVING ECONOMY AND HEALTHY QUALITY OF LIFE. THE PAST COUPLE OF DECADES THE REGION'S COLLECTIVELY INVESTED MORE THAN THREE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS IN. A WATER SUPPLY RELIABILITY AND INVESTMENTS WATER STORAGE. THE SONG NATION WATER CONSERVATION RECYCLING. WE'RE NOT DONE YET OF THOSE HELP TO IMPROVE AND PROVIDE SOME RESILIENCE IN THE IN THE REGION BUT OTHER STILL MORE WORK TO DO. THE CENTERPIECE OF THE NEXT YEAR FROM A WATER SUPPLY AND SENDING REGION IS A C. SENDING US YOUR WATER PROGRAM. THAT THAT PROGRAM REPRESENTS. A LOCALLY CONTROLLED WATER SUPPLY OPTION IT'S NOT SUBJECT TO RAPIDLY CHANGING CLIMATOLOGY NOT SUBJECT TO. CHANGING HYDROLOGY IN THE STATE. SUCKED IN THE STATE'S SNOW PACK AND AVAILABILITY. SO WE FIND THAT TO BE AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT INVESTMENT IN THE REGION. TO PROTECT OUR ECONOMY TO REDUCE RELIANCE ON THE DELTA TO IMPROVE. REGIONAL SELF SUFFICIENCY AND WE- GREATLY APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA'S LEADERSHIP ADVANCING AB TWELVE NINETY WE'RE STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR. IT IS GOOD IN ANY OF TWO MINUTES SIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN PROCESS OR THE OTHER BEHALF OF THE STATE BILL AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL PROUD SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION. THE CITY CALIFORNIA HAS AN INHERENT SORT OF. INTEREST IN MAKING SURE THAT THE INVESTMENT THAT IT HAS AN INFRASTRUCTURE GOES A LOT FURTHER. THAN JUST PROVIDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WAS GOING TO GET BUILT. WITH PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS THE STATE ALSO. GETS THE APPRENTICESHIP. NUMBERS HIGHER BUT ALSO HAS. THE INCENTIVE OF USING LOCAL WORKERS IT WAS SAID THAT THERE'S A BIG A COMMUNITY OF VETERANS IN SAN DIEGO WE KNOW THAT. OF WHAT PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS ALLOW IS FOR THE USE OF THE HELL MISTER HARD HATS PROGRAM WHERE WE ACTUALLY TARGET INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE RETURNING FROM OVERSEAS OR FROM MILITARY SERVICE. AND WE PROMOTE THEM THROUGH OUR PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM AND THEN ACTUALLY HAVE THEM THROUGH THE PUBLIC TO THE PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT WORK ON SPECIFIC INFRASTRUCTURE IN THEIR LOCAL AREA. THAT CANNOT BE DONE UNLESS THERE'S A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT BECAUSE OF THE COMPETITIVE BIDDING RULES AND SO IF A UNION HAS A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT AND THEY HAVE THEIR MEMBERS ARE WORKING FROM THE HIRING HALLS. THEY GET TO SELECT WHO IS UP IN THOSE CALLS HOWEVER WHEN THERE'S A P. LA THE P. LA BECOMES A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT THAT SUPERSEDES OUT. SO WITH THAT WE CAN HIRE VETERANS WOMEN. THIS IS AN IS COMMUNITIES ALL WITHIN THE LOCAL AREA WITH THIS PARTICULAR BILL DOES. A LOT OF THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT TO NOT NOT ONLY BUILD IT AND IT DELAYED BUT ALSO APPLY THE LAW THAT WAS PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN AND TWELVE. TO MAKE THAT THE CITY IS ABLE TO UTILIZE THE STATE'S INVESTMENT. NOW WITH THE STATE INVESTMENT. CAUGHT UP WITH THE LA NEWS OF THE PROJECT EVER AGREEMENT BECAUSE OF PROP A THE INITIATIVE THAT BLOCKED PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT ON THAT. EARLY AGAIN. CITIES COUNTIES SHOW THAT TRICKS UTILIZED BY. YOUR BEEN TIMES THOUGH WHERE SOME OF THESE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE PROHIBITED THEIR OWN SET THEIR OWN SELVES TO DO SO AND SO WHEN I SEND THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO PUT UP PROP A THEY LEFT THE CABBIE OUT THAT WHEN THE STATE INTERVENE AND PARTICIPATED WITH THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IF THAT FINANCES ASSISTANCE CAME WITH THE USE THE CONDITIONAL USE OF APPEAL HEY THAT THAT WOULD BE ALLOWED IN TERMS OF A PROJECT LABOR. TO APPLY TO THAT SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT WHICH IS TO BE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA ASK FOR THOSE WHO MAY BE HERE FOR SUPPORTING TO PLEASE COME FORWARD FIRST CLASS ORGANIZATION. IS WHAT YOU. SEE WHAT YOUR BEST A SISSY SELECT WORKERS TO CALVARY STATE PATRIOTS COUNCIL THE WESTERN STATES COUNCIL SHEET METAL WORKERS. CAL FORTY COALITION UTILITY EMPLOYEES IN THE ELEVATORS CONSTRUCTORS UNION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AS A POINT OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE CAN'T THERE BE A LIMITATION A NUMBER OF GROUPS THAT ONE PERSON REPRESENT.THEIR AGO.

MEASURES THAT WERE MENTIONED BY MISTER DE IS HAVE YET TO BE TESTED SB NINE TWO TWO AND- SB EIGHT TO NINE LEGISLATION THAT WOULD WAS PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE IN THE AGENCY SAN DIEGO WILL CONTEND THAT THIS BILL WOULD VIOLATE. CHARTER CITIES AUTONOMY IN LARGE PART. BUT NOT TO A SORT OF THE LABOR THE POINT ABOUT WHETHER WHO'S RIGHT OR WRONG UNDOUBTEDLY THIS LEGISLATION WILL DELAY THIS PROJECT AND UNFORTUNATELY.

THAT YEAH MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS RICHARD MARX AND ON BEHALF THE WESTERN ELECTRICAL CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION OF PLUMBING HEATING COOLING. CONTRACTORS OF CALIFORNIA AND THE INDEPENDENT ROOFING CONTRACTORS OF CALIFORNIA A TWO MR OF FUENTES POINT. WE ALSO AGREE THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY GOING TO DELAY. OF THE PURE WATER PROJECT WHICH ON ITS MERITS IS A VERY VALUABLE ADJUNCT FOR THE REGION. THE REASON IT WILL DELAY IT IS OF THIS BECAUSE OF THE INTRANSIGENCE QUITE FRANKLY OF THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO. THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO WAS INFORMED THAT THEIR DISCRIMINATORY PROVISION. THAT RESTRICTED THE USE OF OUR THIS IS ON THIS PROJECT VOTE THEY DID THEIR OWN THE CHARTER THEY REFUSE TO RESOLVE THAT. THIS LED TO LITIGATION AND DELAY OF THE PROJECT. IF YOU ASKED TWELVE NINETY IF THE CITY CONTINUES TO ALL THE JACK. WE WILL. REACH HI. BUT WHAT WE WILL BE MEETING IN. FOR THIS. HE WILL GO THE PROJECT. IT WILL HAVE TO RESUBMIT THE BID SPECIFICATIONS FOR REBUILDING THERE ARE ELEVEN CONTRACTS THAT ARE ALREADY PREPARED AND READY TO GO. TO BE RELEASED TO THE SUCCESSFUL. RIGHT TODAY IF THE CITY WOULD SIMPLY REMOVE THE DISCRIMINATORY PROVISION THAT RESULTED IN THE LITIGATION WHICH IS WHAT BROUGHT US HERE TODAY WITH THIS GOTTEN AMEND THIS IS A BAD PRECEDENT THIS FURTHER EVISCERATES THESE OF THE UNIQUE POSITION THE CHARTER CITIES HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. BY RESTRICTING THE ABILITY TO RECEIVE STATE FUNDS UNTIL THEY ADHERE TO A POLICY THAT IS DISCRIMINATORY AND IS ENTIRELY DESIGNED TO KEEP NON SIGNATORY CONTRACTORS FROM BIDDING ON PUBLIC WORKS IN CALIFORNIA THE SIX HUNDRED APPRENTICES FOR WEAKER WOULD APPRECIATE A NO VOTE ON THIS MEASURE THANK YOU.

TWENTY TWELVE TWELVE. THANK YOU NOT TO USE PLA'S WHICH PASSED WATER WE HAD A COURT CASE JUST LAST MONTH RESOLVED THAT. THE PROPOSITION WAS FINE THAT. THESE WEREN'T REQUIRED. WE HAVE A FEDERAL COURTHOUSE THAT WAS RECENTLY COMPLETED ON TIME WITH NO QUALITY ISSUES. WE HAVE A STATE COURTHOUSE IN SAN DIEGO. WITH DE LA THAT WAS FOUR MONTHS LATER. WE HAVE THREE SYSTEMS THAT NEED TO BE REPAIRED REPLACED. AND I'M LOOKING AT THE DEMOGRAPHICS AND I'M SEEING THAT UNION SHOPS AND SAN DIEGO ARE LESS THAN 10% OF THE- WORKFORCE I AM. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WILL WHY WE'RE DOING IN IN RUN. WHEN THE VOTERS HAVE VOTED. AND EXPRESS THEIR POSITION AND WE HAVE A JUDGE THAT TO CONCURRED WITH THAT.

YOU DON'T GET TO HAVE IT BOTH WAYS THEIR LITIGATION HAS DELAYED THIS PROJECT WE'RE PROJECTING ABOUT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN LOST TAXPAYER FUNDS MONTHLY BECAUSE THIS ONGOING LITIGATION I UNDERSTAND CITY COUNCIL YESTERDAY IN SAN DIEGO DECLINED TO SETTLE THE CASE AND SO WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO PERSIST IN THIS. UNLESS WE TAKE ACTION MEASURE I AM I BELIEVE I'M THE ONLY PERSON IN THIS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THAT CAMPAIGN YOU MIGHT NOT BE PRIZED AYE OPPOSED IT. I'M MUCH WAS MADE BY THE PROPONENT. THAT THIS. SO THIS IS MEASURE. EXEMPTED IT'S STATE OR FEDERAL. GOVERNMENT MANDATED PLA'S. THAT WAS WHAT THE PROPONENTS OF THAT MEASURE SOLD ON IN ORDER TO KEEP.
