00:59:25.628 --> 00:59:27.397
MANY WOMEN HERE.

NEXT TO COURAGEOUS MEN I'M

00:59:29.299 --> 00:59:33.169
ESPECIALLY PROUD TO HAVE HEARD

00:59:33.236 --> 00:59:33.770
FROM THE WOMEN ON THE PANEL.

00:59:33.836 --> 00:59:35.571
PREVIOUS PREVIOUSLY BECAUSE IT

00:59:35.638 --> 00:59:37.607
TOOK A LOT OF COURAGE TO COME

00:59:37.674 --> 00:59:41.277

00:59:41.344 --> 00:59:41.544
STORIES.

00:59:41.611 --> 00:59:43.579
SO I THINK FOR ALL OF US THE

00:59:43.646 --> 00:59:45.248
ISSUE IS ABOUT --

00:59:45.315 --> 00:59:49.218
POWER IN THE WORKPLACE.

00:59:49.285 --> 00:59:51.454
AND THE WORST THE IMBALANCE IS A

00:59:51.521 --> 00:59:55.224
POWER THE WORSE THE ABUSES.

00:59:55.291 --> 00:59:57.193
YOU CAN TAKE ALL THESE LAYERS

00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:59.395
FIRST THERE'S THE LAYER OF WOMEN.

00:59:59.462 --> 01:00:01.431
AND THERE'S A LAYER OF WOMEN OF

01:00:01.497 --> 01:00:03.232
COLOR.

01:00:03.299 --> 01:00:03.800
THEN THERE'S THAT LAYER OF

01:00:03.866 --> 01:00:05.401
IMMIGRANT WOMEN [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:05.468 --> 01:00:07.236
UNDOCUMENTED WOMEN.

01:00:07.303 --> 01:00:09.639
AND WOMEN WITHOUT COLLECTIVE

01:00:09.706 --> 01:00:11.441
BARGAINING RIGHTS THOSE ARE ALL

01:00:11.507 --> 01:00:15.278
DIFFERENT LEVELS OF IMBALANCE IN

01:00:15.345 --> 01:00:17.246
THE WORKPLACE.

01:00:17.313 --> 01:00:19.415
AND IT'S ESPECIALLY BAD IN THIS

01:00:19.482 --> 01:00:21.284
INDUSTRY AS YOU HEARD --

01:00:21.351 --> 01:00:23.252
LIKE HOSPITALITY.

01:00:23.319 --> 01:00:25.121
SO --

01:00:25.188 --> 01:00:27.590
MENTIONED BY SOUND THOUGH WAS

01:00:27.657 --> 01:00:29.559
THAT TERRY NAY A RESORT AND I

01:00:29.625 --> 01:00:31.260
JUST.

01:00:31.327 --> 01:00:31.894
I'M JILL BY LAS VEGAS WHO WOULD

01:00:31.961 --> 01:00:33.262
THINK.

01:00:33.329 --> 01:00:35.231
THAT IN SUCH A BEAUTIFUL

01:00:35.298 --> 01:00:37.233
BEAUTIFUL RESORT AREA THESE

01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:39.202
KINDS OF A OF THINGS WOULD BE

01:00:39.268 --> 01:00:39.535
TAKING PLACE.

01:00:39.602 --> 01:00:43.239
BUT THEY RELY ON SUBCONTRACTED

01:00:43.306 --> 01:00:43.840
OUT WORKERS LIKE SOUND THAT.

01:00:43.906 --> 01:00:45.508
THEY HAVE A RESORT WHERE

01:00:45.575 --> 01:00:47.577
HOUSEKEEPERS HAVE TO ENTER THE

01:00:47.643 --> 01:00:51.247
ROOM -- ROOM

01:00:51.314 --> 01:00:53.216
AFTER ROOM ALONE --

01:00:53.282 --> 01:00:57.253
THEY FEEL THE WHOLE RESORT FILLS

01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:59.222
IN ADDITION TO SUBCONTRACTED OUT

01:00:59.288 --> 01:01:01.190
OF THE OF THE REGULAR EMPLOYEES.

01:01:01.257 --> 01:01:01.824
SUBCONTRACTED OUT EMPLOYEES AND

01:01:01.891 --> 01:01:05.194
ANOTHER.

01:01:05.261 --> 01:01:07.163
STATUS WHICH IS J. ONE VISAS

01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:07.463
[INAUDIBLE]

01:01:07.530 --> 01:01:09.198
OKAY.

01:01:09.265 --> 01:01:11.401
SO THESE ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT

01:01:11.467 --> 01:01:13.403
WAYS IN WHICH THIS EMPLOYER IS

01:01:13.469 --> 01:01:17.206
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF EMPLOYEES.

01:01:17.273 --> 01:01:19.175
AND THEY ALL HAVE A DIFFERENT

01:01:19.242 --> 01:01:21.411
LEVEL OF RIGHTS ON THE JOB LESS

01:01:21.477 --> 01:01:25.181
AND LESS AND LESS --

01:01:25.248 --> 01:01:27.183
SO I JUST WANT TO SUM UP --

01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:29.419
THE POLICIES THAT WE THINK OF

01:01:29.485 --> 01:01:31.220
WOULD.

01:01:31.287 --> 01:01:33.356
HELP THESE WOMEN AS ASSEMBLY

01:01:35.391 --> 01:01:37.393
MAKE THEM SAFE ONE IS THE

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:41.230
CURRENT LEGISLATION SPONSORED BY.

01:01:41.297 --> 01:01:43.366

01:01:43.433 --> 01:01:45.501
AB THREO EIGHT ONE TO MAKE

01:01:45.568 --> 01:01:47.336
COMPANIES LIABLE FOR THE

01:01:47.403 --> 01:01:49.272
SUBCONTRACT SUBCONTRACTED OUT

01:01:49.338 --> 01:01:51.274
WORKERS --

01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:53.443
JOINT LIABILITY IT EXISTS FOR

01:01:53.509 --> 01:01:55.578
WAGE THAT BUT A IT SHOULD ALSO

01:01:55.645 --> 01:01:57.146
APPLY TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

01:01:57.213 --> 01:02:01.217
SECOND PANIC BUTTONS --

01:02:01.284 --> 01:02:03.219
AS YOU ASKED THE QUESTION ABOUT

01:02:03.286 --> 01:02:03.820
PANIC BUTTONS IT DOES MAKE A

01:02:03.886 --> 01:02:05.188
DIFFERENCE --

01:02:05.254 --> 01:02:07.156
AND WE ARE.

01:02:07.223 --> 01:02:07.757
LAW SUPPORTING OUR UNION IS

01:02:07.824 --> 01:02:09.258
SUPPORTING.

01:02:09.325 --> 01:02:11.294
A DIFFERENT WAYS OF ARE

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:13.463
REQUIRING EMPLOYERS TO PROVIDE.

01:02:13.529 --> 01:02:15.331
WORKERS WITH PANIC BUTTONS AND

01:02:15.398 --> 01:02:17.467
OTHER PROTECTION SO THAT THEY

01:02:17.533 --> 01:02:18.034
COULD SPEAK OUT [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:18.101 --> 01:02:19.168
SEOUL.

01:02:19.235 --> 01:02:21.404
ON LONG BEACH THERE IS A AND

01:02:21.471 --> 01:02:23.506
INITIATIVE THAT'S PENDING TO BE

01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:25.174

01:02:25.241 --> 01:02:27.577
I'M JUST BY WILL BEAR THIS

01:02:27.643 --> 01:02:29.278
THERE'S AN INITIATIVE THAT'S

01:02:29.345 --> 01:02:31.180
PENDING TO BE PUT ON THE BALLOT.

01:02:31.247 --> 01:02:33.282
OTHER STATE LEGISLATION A. B.

01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:35.184
SET.

01:02:35.251 --> 01:02:35.651
SEVENTEEN SIXTY ONE BY

01:02:35.718 --> 01:02:39.188
ASSEMBLYMAN MORE SEARCHING.

01:02:39.255 --> 01:02:41.157
THERE IS THE IN OAKLAND THERE IS

01:02:41.224 --> 01:02:43.292
ON INITIATIVE ON PANIC BUTTONS

01:02:43.359 --> 01:02:45.228
THAT'S PENDING --

01:02:45.294 --> 01:02:45.728
AS YOU ALL KNOW IN --

01:02:45.795 --> 01:02:49.165
THE FIRST ONE THAT WAS PASSED

01:02:49.232 --> 01:02:49.665
YEAH OUT OF WASHINGTON.

01:02:49.732 --> 01:02:53.236
THAT WAS PASSED UP AN INITIATIVE --

01:02:53.302 --> 01:02:55.304
AT LARGE AND IT WAS HIGHLY

01:02:55.371 --> 01:02:57.406
SUPPORTED BY THE VOTERS.

01:02:57.473 --> 01:02:59.175
AND THEN AGAIN --

01:02:59.242 --> 01:03:03.246
THE CHICAGO CITY ALSO PASSED --

01:03:03.312 --> 01:03:05.615
A LAW ON THE CITY COUNCIL SO

01:03:05.681 --> 01:03:07.250
THEY HAVE IT IN PLACE --

01:03:07.316 --> 01:03:11.420
SO THOSE ARE EXAMPLES OF THE

01:03:11.487 --> 01:03:13.256
VARIOUS PIECES OF LEGISLATION --

01:03:13.322 --> 01:03:15.191
THAT --

01:03:15.258 --> 01:03:17.293
SUPPORT THE RIGHT POLICIES THIRD

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:21.197
WE NEED IMMIGRATION REFORM

01:03:21.264 --> 01:03:21.497
[INAUDIBLE]

01:03:21.564 --> 01:03:25.234
WE NEED.

01:03:25.301 --> 01:03:27.470
UNFORTUNATELY IF THE WORLD TO

01:03:27.537 --> 01:03:29.539
THIS PANEL THINK WE WOULD HAVE

01:03:29.605 --> 01:03:31.240
PASSED IT BY NOW.

01:03:31.307 --> 01:03:31.874
IF IT WAS UP TO THE CALIFORNIA

01:03:31.941 --> 01:03:33.543
LEGISLATURE WE WHAT A PASSED

01:03:33.609 --> 01:03:35.244
IMMIGRATION REFORM BY NOW.

01:03:35.311 --> 01:03:37.246
I KNOW IT'S NOT IN.

01:03:37.313 --> 01:03:39.248
OUR HANDS SPECIFICALLY BUT WE

01:03:39.315 --> 01:03:41.250
HAVE TO KEEP FIGHTING FOR IT

01:03:41.317 --> 01:03:43.219
BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY TO CREATE

01:03:43.286 --> 01:03:45.421
MORE EQUALITY ON IN THE

01:03:45.488 --> 01:03:47.356
WORKPLACE AND WE WANT TO MAKE

01:03:47.423 --> 01:03:47.557
SURE.

01:03:47.623 --> 01:03:49.292
THAT THERE ARE --

01:03:49.358 --> 01:03:51.394
THAT NO GUEST WORKER PROGRAMS

01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:55.131
EXIST ALT WITHOUT FULL AND EQUAL

01:03:55.198 --> 01:03:57.366
RIGHTS OF U. S. WORKERS WITHOUT

01:03:57.433 --> 01:03:59.402
PEOPLE RIGHTS THEN THEY WILL BE

01:03:59.468 --> 01:04:01.437
TAKEN OF ADVANTAGE OF AND THE

01:04:01.504 --> 01:04:03.406
LAST POLICY THAT I WOULD LIKE.

01:04:03.472 --> 01:04:05.441
TO RECOMMEND AND THAT IS

01:04:05.508 --> 01:04:07.176
UNIONIZATION.

01:04:07.243 --> 01:04:11.180
UNIONIZATION.

01:04:11.247 --> 01:04:13.416
UNIONIZATION AND SHOULD NOT BE

01:04:15.918 --> 01:04:17.186
THEY FINALLY WIN.

01:04:17.253 --> 01:04:21.157
UNIONIZATION SHOULD BE A POLICY

01:04:21.224 --> 01:04:23.259
PERIOD THAT IS IMPLEMENTED EVERY

01:04:23.326 --> 01:04:25.528
SINGLE WAY AND THAT THE LAW OF

01:04:25.595 --> 01:04:27.396
THE LAND ACTUALLY GET

01:04:27.463 --> 01:04:29.332
IMPLEMENTED AND NOT JUST --

01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:59.262
ISSUE WE HAVE A FEATURE --

01:04:59.328 --> 01:05:01.330
SUMMARIZING SOME OF THE

01:05:01.397 --> 01:05:01.964
RECOMMENDATIONS FROM A RECENT

01:05:02.031 --> 01:05:03.466
NATIONAL CONFERENCE --

01:05:03.532 --> 01:05:05.534
MARIA ELENA WAS THERE AND

01:05:05.601 --> 01:05:07.403
PARTICIPATED ALONG WITH MANY

01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:07.670
OTHER --

01:05:07.737 --> 01:05:09.272
CIVIL RIGHTS --

01:05:09.338 --> 01:05:13.209
AND WOMEN THIS --

01:05:13.276 --> 01:05:15.111
TO OUTLINED SOME OF THE FEDERAL

01:05:15.177 --> 01:05:15.378
LEGAL --

01:05:15.444 --> 01:05:17.480
ISSUES AND SOME OF THE CHANGES

01:05:17.546 --> 01:05:19.215
TO FEDERAL LAWS --

01:05:19.282 --> 01:05:19.882
THAT WERE SORELY NEEDED AS WELL

01:05:19.949 --> 01:05:21.183
AS OTHER STRATEGIES --

01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:23.619
I ALSO BROUGHT WITH ME AND I

01:05:23.686 --> 01:05:25.187
WILL LEAVE FOR THE COMMITTEE --

01:05:25.254 --> 01:05:27.490
HAVE VERY RECENT ARTICLE IN THE

01:05:27.556 --> 01:05:29.191
STANFORD LAW REVIEW WAS --

01:05:29.258 --> 01:05:31.360
COMPILED BY A NUMBER OF LAW

01:05:31.427 --> 01:05:33.262
PROFESSORS AROUND THE COUNTRY

01:05:33.329 --> 01:05:35.131
WHO ARE SPECIALISTS AND

01:05:35.197 --> 01:05:37.233
EMPLOYMENT LAW AND SEX

01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:39.368
DISCRIMINATION LAW AND I THINK

01:05:39.435 --> 01:05:41.170
MANY OF THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS --

01:05:41.237 --> 01:05:41.837
WOULD BE EXTRAORDINARILY HELPFUL

01:05:41.904 --> 01:05:45.174
TO YOU AS YOU ARE FASHIONING --

01:05:45.241 --> 01:05:45.541
LEGISLATIVE --

01:05:45.608 --> 01:05:47.243
INITIATIVES --

01:05:47.310 --> 01:05:49.445
THEY ADDRESS MANY OF THE ISSUES

01:05:49.512 --> 01:05:51.247
THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED HERE TODAY --

01:05:51.314 --> 01:05:51.881
I THINK CALIFORNIA HAS SOME OF

01:05:51.947 --> 01:05:53.716
THE STRONGER LAWS BUT THEY HAVE

01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:57.186
IDEAS OR EVEN HOW TO STRENGTHEN --

01:05:57.253 --> 01:05:57.820
THE LAWS THAT WE HAVE IN THIS

01:05:57.887 --> 01:05:59.455
STATE AND I KNOW THEY WOULD BE

01:05:59.522 --> 01:06:01.490
MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU

01:06:01.557 --> 01:06:03.192
ON ANY --

01:06:03.259 --> 01:06:05.361
SPECIFIC LEGISLATION THAT YOU

01:06:05.428 --> 01:06:05.928
YOU WANTED TO PURSUE I AM

01:06:05.995 --> 01:06:07.596
CERTAIN THAT THEY WOULD ITS A

01:06:07.663 --> 01:06:09.231
VERY COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT.

01:06:09.298 --> 01:06:11.534
I'M ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:13.202
THINGS --

01:06:13.269 --> 01:06:13.836
THAT I THINK TO RECOGNIZE ABOUT

01:06:13.903 --> 01:06:15.638
SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS THAT ONE

01:06:15.705 --> 01:06:17.740
IT'S NOT ALWAYS SEXUAL IN NATURE.

01:06:17.807 --> 01:06:21.243
BUT IT ALWAYS OCCURS IN GATED.

01:06:21.310 --> 01:06:23.379
ASUS AND WHERE THERE IS

01:06:23.446 --> 01:06:25.281
TREMENDOUS INEQUALITY AS MARIA

01:06:25.348 --> 01:06:27.216
ELENA SAID --

01:06:27.283 --> 01:06:29.285
IN THE EMPLOYMENT SITUATION AND

01:06:29.352 --> 01:06:31.354
SO YOU CAN ONLY REALLY APPROACH --

01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:33.489
ELIMINATING SEXUAL HARASSMENT IF

01:06:33.556 --> 01:06:35.324
YOU'RE ALSO LOOKING AT HOW DO

01:06:35.391 --> 01:06:37.293
YOU FORCE --

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:41.297
A DESEGREGATION WITHIN THE

01:06:41.364 --> 01:06:41.630
WORKPLACE --

01:06:41.697 --> 01:06:43.566
AT ALL LEVELS AND IN ALL

01:06:43.632 --> 01:06:43.899
DIFFERENT --

01:06:43.966 --> 01:06:45.434
INDUSTRIES IN ALL DIFFERENT

01:06:45.501 --> 01:06:47.303
TYPES OF ORGANIZATIONS --

01:06:47.370 --> 01:06:49.605
WOMEN ARE RELEGATED TO THE

01:06:49.672 --> 01:06:53.142
LOWEST JOBS IN EVERY SECTOR --

01:06:53.209 --> 01:06:53.743
AND MEN HAVE THE TOP JOBS IN

01:06:53.809 --> 01:06:57.213
EVERY SEX AND IT IS --

01:06:57.279 --> 01:06:59.248
IMBALANCED UP AT EVERY LEVEL

01:06:59.315 --> 01:07:01.217
WOMEN ARE CONCENTRATED IN

01:07:01.283 --> 01:07:03.319
CERTAIN TYPES OF JOBS AND THAT

01:07:03.386 --> 01:07:03.819
JUST REINFORCES GENDER

01:07:03.886 --> 01:07:05.187
STEREOTYPES.

01:07:05.254 --> 01:07:07.223
IT REINFORCES --

01:07:07.289 --> 01:07:09.258
THAT WOMEN ARE SECOND CLASS

01:07:09.325 --> 01:07:11.227
CITIZENS IN THE WORKPLACE --

01:07:11.293 --> 01:07:13.462
AND AUNTS AND IN MANY CASES --

01:07:13.529 --> 01:07:15.498
ARE -- THERE --

01:07:15.564 --> 01:07:19.268
TO PLEASE THEIR CUSTOMERS ARE CO

01:07:19.335 --> 01:07:21.237
WORKERS WHO HAVE POWER OVER THEM --

01:07:21.303 --> 01:07:23.339
YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD ABOUT --

01:07:23.406 --> 01:07:25.174
WOMEN IN THE HOTEL INDUSTRY

01:07:25.241 --> 01:07:27.176
WOMEN IN THE FOOD SERVICES

01:07:27.243 --> 01:07:27.476
INDUSTRY --

01:07:27.543 --> 01:07:29.445
THERE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE --

01:07:29.512 --> 01:07:31.580
AND SO THE LAWS MUST REALLY

01:07:31.647 --> 01:07:33.649
FOCUS ON HOW WE ADDRESS SOME OF

01:07:33.716 --> 01:07:35.251
THE ISSUES YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD --

01:07:35.317 --> 01:07:37.586
THESE ARE SOME OF THEIR KEY

01:07:37.653 --> 01:07:39.255
RECOMMENDATIONS --

01:07:39.321 --> 01:07:41.190
THAT FEDERAL AND STATE

01:07:41.257 --> 01:07:43.459
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND THEY

01:07:43.526 --> 01:07:45.461
STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN FORCES --

01:07:45.528 --> 01:07:47.329
LAWS AGAINST SEX OUT

01:07:47.396 --> 01:07:51.200
DISCRIMINATION THAT IN ADDITION --

01:07:51.267 --> 01:07:51.834
TO JUST TAPPED TO CHALLENGING

01:07:51.901 --> 01:07:55.204
THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT THAT WE

01:07:55.271 --> 01:07:57.339
COMBINED A CHALLENGE TO THE SEX --

01:07:57.406 --> 01:08:01.210
SEGREGATION AND THE STEREOTYPING

01:08:01.277 --> 01:08:01.811
IN THE INEQUALITY IN THE WAY

01:08:01.877 --> 01:08:03.245
WORKPLACES ARE STRUCTURE.

01:08:03.312 --> 01:08:05.581
BOB BECAUSE ONLY WHEN WE HAVE

01:08:05.648 --> 01:08:07.683
GENDER BALANCE AT EVERY LEVEL OF

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:11.287
EVERY ORGANIZATION WILL WE SEE --

01:08:11.353 --> 01:08:13.222
SEXUAL HARASSMENT --

01:08:13.289 --> 01:08:13.823
REALLY BEGIN TO DISAPPEAR AND

01:08:13.889 --> 01:08:17.226
DISAPPEAR RAPIDLY --

01:08:17.293 --> 01:08:17.460
THAT --

01:08:17.526 --> 01:08:19.361
FEDERAL AND STATE LAW SHOULD

01:08:19.428 --> 01:08:21.297
ALSO REQUIRE ORGANIZATIONS TO

01:08:21.363 --> 01:08:21.964
ELIMINATE SEX SPECIFIC GROOMING

01:08:22.031 --> 01:08:25.234
AND DRESS REQUIRE --

01:08:25.301 --> 01:08:27.203
TO REQUIRE WAITRESSES --

01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:29.305
TO WEAR SKIMPY OUTFITS TOM AND I

01:08:29.371 --> 01:08:31.674
SUSPECT I I KNOW THAT MANY OF

01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:33.509
THE HOTEL WORKERS UNIFORMS MAKE

01:08:33.576 --> 01:08:35.344
IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO

01:08:35.411 --> 01:08:37.213
PERFORM THEIR JOBS --

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:39.415
IN A DIGNIFIED MANNER AND SO I

01:08:39.482 --> 01:08:39.748
THE STATE --

01:08:39.815 --> 01:08:43.152
COULD LOOK AT LEGISLATION IN

01:08:43.219 --> 01:08:45.488
THAT WAY AS WELL UP THE UNIFORMS

01:08:45.554 --> 01:08:47.223
SHOULD ONLY BE RELEVANT TO

01:08:47.289 --> 01:08:47.890
WHATEVER IS ESSENTIAL AS PART OF

01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:49.191
THE JOB DESCRIPTION.

01:08:49.258 --> 01:08:51.227
I'M NOT --

01:08:51.293 --> 01:08:53.462
TO CREATE A HETEROSEXUAL --

01:08:53.529 --> 01:08:55.331
SEXUAL --

01:08:55.397 --> 01:08:57.299
RETRACTION.

01:08:57.366 --> 01:08:59.468
TO STEREOTYPE THAT WOMEN IN THE

01:08:59.535 --> 01:09:07.209
WORKPLACE.

01:09:07.276 --> 01:09:09.378
SAY OH LAWMAKERS IN AGENCIES

01:09:09.445 --> 01:09:11.313
ALSO SHOULD LOOK AT HOW WE

01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:11.780
CREATE INCENTIVES FOR

01:09:11.847 --> 01:09:13.415
ORGANIZATIONS TO ELIMINATE

01:09:13.482 --> 01:09:15.251
EMPLOYEE VULNERABILITIES --

01:09:15.317 --> 01:09:17.386
IN THE WORKPLACE AND UNCHECK

01:09:17.453 --> 01:09:19.255
SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY --

01:09:19.321 --> 01:09:21.190
OBVIOUSLY --

01:09:21.257 --> 01:09:21.824
PANIC BUTTONS IS ONE WAY TO DO

01:09:21.891 --> 01:09:23.659
THAT THERE ARE MANY INNOVATIVE

01:09:23.726 --> 01:09:25.694
WAYS TO DO IT WE HAVE ALL KINDS

01:09:25.761 --> 01:09:27.429
OF STANDARDS AND THE FOOD

01:09:27.496 --> 01:09:29.265
INDUSTRY --

01:09:29.331 --> 01:09:31.267
HEALTH STANDARDS --

01:09:31.333 --> 01:09:33.269
WHY CAN'T WE HAVE STANDARDS AND

01:09:33.335 --> 01:09:35.204
ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES

01:09:35.271 --> 01:09:35.871
THAT WOMEN ARE FACED WITH ON THE

01:09:35.938 --> 01:09:39.141
JOB AS PART OF THEIR HEALTH?

01:09:39.208 --> 01:09:41.277
AND THE HEALTH OF OUR SOCIETY SO

01:09:41.343 --> 01:09:43.279
WE SHOULD LOOK AT THAT AS WELL --

01:09:43.345 --> 01:09:45.447
OBVIOUSLY IS YOU PARTY HOOD --

01:09:45.514 --> 01:09:46.048
HEARD A CONTRACT INDEPENDENT

01:09:46.115 --> 01:09:47.550
CONTRACTORS HAVE TO BE COVERED

01:09:47.616 --> 01:09:49.385
IN ALL INSTANCES MANY TIMES THE

01:09:49.451 --> 01:09:51.353
LAW DOES NOT APPLY AT THE

01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:53.222
FEDERAL LEVEL TITLE SEVEN

01:09:53.289 --> 01:09:53.622

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:55.624
OUT ESPECIALLY TO SMALLER

01:09:55.691 --> 01:09:57.493
WORKPLACES ON THIS STATE OF

01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:59.461
CALIFORNIA COULD BE VERY --

01:09:59.528 --> 01:10:01.463
INNOVATIVE AND AND ADDRESSING

01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:03.365
THAT ALSO THE STATE HAS

01:10:03.432 --> 01:10:05.334
TREMENDOUS ECONOMIC POWER WITH

01:10:05.401 --> 01:10:07.136
RESPECT TO THE CONTRACTORS --

01:10:07.202 --> 01:10:07.670
WHERE STATE EMPLOYEES ARE

01:10:07.736 --> 01:10:11.240

SEXUAL ASSAULT OR HARASSMENT

01:10:15.311 --> 01:10:15.878
STATE EMPLOYEES SHOULD NOT BE

01:10:15.945 --> 01:10:17.313
ALLOWED TO STAY --

01:10:17.379 --> 01:10:19.348
IN THOSE HOTELS OR TO FREQUENT

THOSE RESTAURANTS I AND THIS AND

01:10:21.483 --> 01:10:22.051
THAT CALIFORNIA HAS THE RIGHT TO

DEMAND THESE ARE OUR TAX DOLLARS

01:10:25.554 --> 01:10:31.193

INADEQUATE RIGHT NOW IS IT

01:10:50.145 --> 01:10:53.282
ADDRESSES --

01:10:53.349 --> 01:10:53.916
CALIFORNIA STATE LAW COULD ALSO

01:10:53.983 --> 01:10:55.584
ENCOURAGE BYSTANDER INTERVENTION

01:10:55.651 --> 01:10:57.586

01:11:15.170 --> 01:11:17.139
AT HOW THOSE LAWS ARE STRUCTURED.

01:11:17.206 --> 01:11:19.208
A COUPLE FINAL --

01:11:19.274 --> 01:11:21.210
POINTS IS THAT FEDERAL AND STATE

01:11:21.276 --> 01:11:23.412
HAVE TO DEFINE SEXUAL HARASSMENT

01:11:23.479 --> 01:11:23.712
IS BEING --

01:11:23.779 --> 01:11:25.547
DE EMPLOYER BEING SUBJECT TO

01:11:25.614 --> 01:11:27.383

01:12:09.258 --> 01:12:09.792

HARASSMENT. ONE OF THE MOST

01:12:17.566 --> 01:12:19.268
IMPORTANT IS THAT WE'VE GOT TO

01:12:19.334 --> 01:12:19.902
RESTRUCTURE OUR WORKPLACES SO

01:12:19.968 --> 01:12:21.270

PRIMARILY AROUND --

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:13.388
WORKING WITH LOW WAGE WORKERS

01:13:13.455 --> 01:13:13.856
IMMIGRANT WORKERS --

REPRESENTING WORKERS BOTH

01:13:29.338 --> 01:13:29.471
HAVE.

01:13:29.538 --> 01:13:31.507
EXPERIENCE WITH SEXUAL

01:13:31.573 --> 01:13:33.342
HARASSMENT IN NON LOW WAGE

01:13:33.408 --> 01:13:35.377
INDUSTRIES WHERE WE HAVE --

01:13:35.444 --> 01:13:39.248
SITUATIONS WHERE I'VE HAD TO

01:13:39.314 --> 01:13:39.882
PARTICIPATE AS AN INVESTIGATOR

01:13:39.948 --> 01:13:41.583
AND IN THOSE INSTANCES --

01:13:41.650 --> 01:13:43.519
IN ADDITION TO WHAT WE'VE SEEN

01:13:43.585 --> 01:13:45.487
WITH LOW WAGE WORKERS WE ALSO

01:13:45.554 --> 01:13:47.189
SEE THAT --

01:13:47.256 --> 01:13:47.856
WOMEN IN THOSE INDUSTRIES THAT

01:13:47.923 --> 01:13:49.625
ARE NOT TRADITIONAL LOW WAGE

01:13:49.691 --> 01:13:51.260
INDUSTRIES --

01:13:51.326 --> 01:13:53.395
FEAR THE SAME OF FAILURE TO

01:13:53.462 --> 01:13:55.197
REPORT THEY ARE AFRAID TO REPORT

01:13:55.264 --> 01:13:55.864
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT REPORTING

01:13:55.931 --> 01:13:57.232
WILL RESULT IN RETALIATION.

01:13:57.299 --> 01:13:59.501
AND OFTENTIMES THAT RETALIATION

01:13:59.568 --> 01:14:01.203
MEANS -- AND

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:03.372
RESULTS IN IMPEDIMENTS TO PUBLIC

01:14:03.438 --> 01:14:05.207
CONTINUING --

01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:05.808
IN PROMOTING THEIR COULD HAVE

01:14:05.874 --> 01:14:07.576
CAREER OR BEING ABLE TO OBTAIN

01:14:07.643 --> 01:14:09.244
OTHER OPPORTUNITIES.

01:14:09.311 --> 01:14:11.513
AND SO I'M I'M WAS GOING TO

01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:13.549
DISCUSS JUST FIVE ISSUES I HOPE

01:14:13.615 --> 01:14:14.049
I CAN GET TO THEM ALL.

01:14:14.116 --> 01:14:15.684
THAT WE SEE RECURRING IN TERMS

01:14:15.751 --> 01:14:17.553
OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND TO

01:14:17.619 --> 01:14:19.421
THINK ABOUT POLICIES THAT WOULD

01:14:19.488 --> 01:14:21.390
ASSIST IN PREVENTING SEXUAL HER --

01:14:21.456 --> 01:14:21.990
HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT IN THE

01:14:22.057 --> 01:14:23.258
WORKPLACE.

01:14:23.325 --> 01:14:25.294
I'M AND THE THE FIRST WOULD BE

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:27.296
TIME TO GET --

01:14:27.362 --> 01:14:27.930
TO THE POINT OF THE FAILURE TO

01:14:27.996 --> 01:14:29.565
REPORT AND TRYING TO FIND

01:14:29.631 --> 01:14:31.500
LEGISLATION THAT WILL ACTUALLY

01:14:31.567 --> 01:14:33.468
ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF WHY IS IT

01:14:33.535 --> 01:14:34.036
THAT WOMEN ARE FREE TO COME

01:14:34.102 --> 01:14:35.637
FORWARD WE SEXUAL HARASSMENT

01:14:35.704 --> 01:14:37.573
IMPACTS ALL GENDERS SO IT'S NOT

01:14:37.639 --> 01:14:39.174
JUST WOMEN.

01:14:39.241 --> 01:14:41.143
BUT IT'S THE FEAR AS WE HEARD

01:14:41.210 --> 01:14:43.178
FROM THE WOMEN WHO TESTIFIED.

01:14:43.245 --> 01:14:45.180
EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON.

01:14:45.247 --> 01:14:45.848
THE FEAR OF LOSING THEIR JOB THE

01:14:45.914 --> 01:14:47.549
FACT THAT THEY HAVE CHILDREN

01:14:47.616 --> 01:14:49.184
THAT THEY NEED TO SUPPORT.

01:14:49.251 --> 01:14:51.253
THE FEAR OF RETALIATION IN OTHER

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:53.255
FORMS NOT JUST LOSING JOBS WHAT

01:14:53.322 --> 01:14:53.889
OTHER FORMS AS I MENTIONED IN

01:14:53.956 --> 01:14:55.557
TERMS OF BLOCKING THEIR ABILITY

01:14:55.624 --> 01:14:57.426
TO FURTHER PROMOTE.

01:14:57.492 --> 01:14:59.328
BLOCKING OPPORTUNITIES EVEN WITH

01:14:59.394 --> 01:15:01.196
ANOTHER EMPLOYER.

01:15:01.263 --> 01:15:03.165
I'M HOW TO ENCOURAGE REPORTING

01:15:03.232 --> 01:15:05.167
WHAT TYPE OF POLICY AND

01:15:05.234 --> 01:15:05.534
LEGISLATION --

01:15:05.601 --> 01:15:07.369
COULD BE ENACTED TO SUPPORT

01:15:07.436 --> 01:15:09.538
WOMEN TO BE ABLE TO COME FORWARD

01:15:09.605 --> 01:15:09.838
TO REPORT.

01:15:09.905 --> 01:15:11.607
EDUCATION AND TRAINING IS REALLY

01:15:11.673 --> 01:15:13.242
IMPORTANT --

01:15:13.308 --> 01:15:17.279
AND AS OF THE CHAIRS LAW

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:17.913
NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT REQUIRES

01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:19.314
ADDITIONAL TRAINING IN THE

01:15:19.381 --> 01:15:21.283
JANITORIAL SECTOR IN THE YEAH

01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:21.917
LAST TIME BUT WHAT DOES HAVE

01:15:21.984 --> 01:15:23.719
DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB IN TERMS

01:15:23.785 --> 01:15:25.420
OF BUT WORKING WITH THIS.

01:15:25.487 --> 01:15:27.389
DIFFERENT MODEL TO EDUCATE

01:15:27.456 --> 01:15:29.224
WORKERS IN INDUSTRIES.

01:15:29.291 --> 01:15:31.426
A MODEL THAT'S BASED ON THE

01:15:31.493 --> 01:15:33.228
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE MOVEMENT.

01:15:33.295 --> 01:15:35.397
A MODEL THAT FOCUSES ON BREAKING

01:15:35.464 --> 01:15:37.266
DOWN BARRIERS --

01:15:37.332 --> 01:15:39.201
WITHIN OUR CULTURE AND SOCIETY

01:15:39.268 --> 01:15:41.370
UP WITHIN OUR FAMILIES PART OF

01:15:41.436 --> 01:15:43.272
THE REASON THAT OF MANY OF LOW

01:15:43.338 --> 01:15:45.440
WAGE WORKERS IN PARTICULAR

01:15:45.507 --> 01:15:47.276
IMMIGRANT WORKERS --

01:15:47.342 --> 01:15:47.943
PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT CULTURES DO

01:15:48.010 --> 01:15:49.678
NOT COME FORWARD IN TERMS OF

01:15:49.745 --> 01:15:51.480
REPORTING IS BECAUSE THE WAY

01:15:51.546 --> 01:15:53.148
WOMEN ARE TREATED IN SOCIETY.

01:15:53.215 --> 01:15:55.417
THEY FEEL THAT THEY DON'T HAVE

01:15:55.484 --> 01:15:55.817
TOO MANY WOMEN --

01:15:55.884 --> 01:15:57.653
AS THE PROBLEM DOES HAVE LEARNED

01:15:57.719 --> 01:15:59.454
IN DOING THIS WORK.

01:15:59.521 --> 01:16:00.022
REALIZE THAT THROUGH THIS

01:16:00.088 --> 01:16:01.423
EDUCATION THEY DON'T EVEN

01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:03.558
REALIZE THAT WHAT THEY WERE

01:16:03.625 --> 01:16:05.360
EXPERIENCING WAS ABOUT SEXUAL

01:16:05.427 --> 01:16:05.661
HARASSMENT.

01:16:05.727 --> 01:16:07.262
WAS IN FACT GREAT.

01:16:07.329 --> 01:16:09.598
AND SO THIS EDUCATION TALKING TO

01:16:09.665 --> 01:16:11.533
WORKERS IN THE LANGUAGE THAT

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:12.134
THEY UNDERSTAND IS EXTREMELY

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:13.168
IMPORTANT.

01:16:13.235 --> 01:16:15.704
AT WE HAVE LAWS ON THE BOOKS ARE

01:16:15.771 --> 01:16:17.139
REQUIRE EMPLOYERS TO EDUCATE

01:16:17.205 --> 01:16:19.274
ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

01:16:19.341 --> 01:16:19.841
YET THERE IS NOT MUCH OF A

01:16:19.908 --> 01:16:21.176
CHANGE AND I THINK.

01:16:21.243 --> 01:16:23.612
YOUR GROUNDBREAKING LEGISLATION

01:16:23.679 --> 01:16:25.447
IN TERMS OF NINETEEN SEVENTY

01:16:25.514 --> 01:16:25.948
EIGHT AND HOPEFULLY THE

01:16:26.014 --> 01:16:27.149
INNOVATIVE --

01:16:27.215 --> 01:16:29.418
TRAINING WITH RESPECT APPEAR

01:16:29.484 --> 01:16:31.219
TRAINERS IN THE WORKPLACE OR YOU

01:16:31.286 --> 01:16:33.188
COULD HAVE WORKERS WHO COME OUT.

01:16:33.255 --> 01:16:33.722
CAN TALK TO WORKERS IN A

01:16:33.789 --> 01:16:35.357
LANGUAGE THEY UNDERSTAND IN A

01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:37.392
TRAUMA INFORMED TRAINING WORKERS

01:16:37.459 --> 01:16:39.161
WHO ARE SURVIVORS WHO HAVE BEEN

01:16:39.227 --> 01:16:39.795
THERE TO BE ABLE TO ENCOURAGE

01:16:39.861 --> 01:16:41.596
WOMEN TO COME FORWARD AND FEEL

01:16:41.663 --> 01:16:43.332
THAT THEY ARE SUPPORTED AND KNOW

01:16:43.398 --> 01:16:45.200
THAT THEY CAN REPORT.

01:16:45.267 --> 01:16:47.269
WITHOUT FEAR OF RETALIATION --

01:16:47.336 --> 01:16:49.237
THE SECOND ISSUE I WANT TO

01:16:49.304 --> 01:16:51.173
DISCUSS IS IN FACT RETALIATION

01:16:51.239 --> 01:16:53.342
AND WE HAVE LAWS ON THE BOOKS ON

01:16:53.408 --> 01:16:55.410
RETALIATION AND AND BUT YET IT'S

01:16:55.477 --> 01:16:57.212
INEVITABLE AND IT STILL HAPPENS.

01:16:57.279 --> 01:16:59.614
AND ONE OF THE ISSUES WITH

01:16:59.681 --> 01:17:00.148
RETALIATION IS THAT IT'S

01:17:00.215 --> 01:17:01.216
DIFFICULT TO PROVE.

01:17:01.283 --> 01:17:03.685
IT'S OFTEN HE SAID SHE SAID OR

01:17:03.752 --> 01:17:05.587
HE SAID HE SAID OR SHE SAID SHE

01:17:05.654 --> 01:17:09.257
SAID AND HAVING THINGS LIKE THE

01:17:09.324 --> 01:17:09.858
REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION WITCHES

01:17:09.925 --> 01:17:11.626
AND AND I UNDERSTAND OF PENDING

01:17:11.693 --> 01:17:13.228
LEGISLATION.

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:15.197
A WOULD BE HELPFUL BUT I THINK

01:17:15.263 --> 01:17:15.731
POLICIES THAT WOULD GET AT

01:17:15.797 --> 01:17:25.607
TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO ENSURE

01:17:25.674 --> 01:17:26.074
THAT RETALIATION IS.

01:17:26.141 --> 01:17:26.708
PREVENTED NOT ONLY PROHIBITED

01:17:26.775 --> 01:17:27.342
BUT LOOKING AT WAYS TO ENSURE

01:17:27.409 --> 01:17:27.943
THAT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN BECAUSE

01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:28.210
IT DOES.

01:17:28.276 --> 01:17:29.111
AND IN MANY WAYS --

01:17:29.177 --> 01:17:31.113
THE NEXT WOULD BE A SHIFT

01:17:31.179 --> 01:17:33.281
CULTURES IN THE WORKPLACE --

01:17:33.348 --> 01:17:35.217
AND THIS IS SOMEWHAT TIED TO

01:17:35.283 --> 01:17:35.884
THESE NON DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS

01:17:35.951 --> 01:17:37.185
THAT THAT --

01:17:37.252 --> 01:17:39.554
MANY EMPLOYERS OFTEN SIGN WHEN A

01:17:39.621 --> 01:17:41.623
WORKER COMES FOR TO COMPLAINTS

01:17:41.690 --> 01:17:43.158
ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

01:17:43.225 --> 01:17:45.193
SO YOU HAVE REPEAT OFFENDERS WHO

01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:47.162
ENGAGE IN THIS CONDUCT.

01:17:47.229 --> 01:17:47.763
YOU HAVE THE PROBLEM WITH THE

01:17:47.829 --> 01:17:49.264
FAILURE TO REPORT.

01:17:49.331 --> 01:17:51.500
YOU HAVE A FEAR OF RETALIATION

01:17:51.566 --> 01:17:53.368
AND THEN THE ACTUAL RETALIATION

01:17:53.435 --> 01:17:53.869
BECAUSE IT DOES HAPPEN

01:17:53.935 --> 01:17:55.570
INEVITABLY IF IT DOESN'T HAPPEN

01:17:55.637 --> 01:17:57.539
IMMEDIATELY IT WILL HAPPEN DOWN

01:17:57.606 --> 01:17:57.806
THE ROAD.

01:17:57.873 --> 01:17:59.341
AND FAILURE TO REPORT

01:17:59.408 --> 01:17:59.875
IMMEDIATELY AFTER SEXUAL

01:17:59.941 --> 01:18:01.309
HARASSMENT.

01:18:01.376 --> 01:18:03.345
YOU REPORT IT LATER THERE IS

01:18:03.412 --> 01:18:03.979
STILL GOING TO BE SOME FORM OF

01:18:04.046 --> 01:18:05.313
RETALIATION.

01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:07.249
THE PROBLEM WITH THE NON

01:18:07.315 --> 01:18:07.883
DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS IS THAT

01:18:07.949 --> 01:18:11.186
YOU YOU YOU HAVE TO SITUATIONS

01:18:11.253 --> 01:18:13.221
THE EMPLOYER SIGNS AN AGREEMENT.

01:18:13.288 --> 01:18:15.424
PROMISES YOU KNOW THE WORKER IT

01:18:15.490 --> 01:18:17.225
WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

01:18:17.292 --> 01:18:19.194
CONFIDENTIALITY NO ONE CAN TALK

01:18:19.261 --> 01:18:21.263
ABOUT IT AND THEN THERE'S TWO

01:18:21.329 --> 01:18:21.897
THINGS THAT HAPPEN EITHER THAT.

01:18:21.963 --> 01:18:23.532
THAT PERSON WAS TERMINATED AND

01:18:23.598 --> 01:18:25.367
THEY MOVE ON TO ANOTHER EMPLOYER

01:18:25.434 --> 01:18:27.235
IN THE NEW EMPLOYER HAS NO IDEA.

01:18:27.302 --> 01:18:29.471
THAT THIS PERSON ENGAGED IN THIS

01:18:29.538 --> 01:18:31.406
TYPE OF BEHAVIOR AND SO NOW

01:18:31.473 --> 01:18:31.940
THEY'VE HIRED SOMEONE WHO

01:18:32.007 --> 01:18:33.508
POTENTIALLY IS GOING TO BE A

01:18:33.575 --> 01:18:35.277
REPEAT OFFENDER --

01:18:35.343 --> 01:18:37.546
OR NUMBER TWO THEY KEEP THAT

01:18:37.612 --> 01:18:38.146
PERSON EMPLOYED AND THEY KEEP

01:18:38.213 --> 01:18:41.283
WORKING TO COME TO CONTINUE TO

01:18:41.349 --> 01:18:43.285
REPEAT THAT BEHAVIOR BECAUSE OF

01:18:43.351 --> 01:18:43.852
THE FACT THAT EVERYTHING'S

01:18:43.919 --> 01:18:45.454
CONFIDENTIAL AND YOU CAN'T

01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:46.088
DISCUSS THE FACT THAT IT EVER

01:18:46.154 --> 01:18:47.255
HAPPENED.

01:18:47.322 --> 01:18:49.291
OR THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT OR

01:18:49.357 --> 01:18:49.925
THAT THERE EVER WAS AN AGREEMENT

01:18:49.991 --> 01:18:51.293
THAT WAS REACHED --

01:18:51.359 --> 01:18:53.428
IN FACT MANY OF THESE AGREEMENTS

01:18:53.495 --> 01:18:53.962
IN ORDER FOR A YOU KNOW A

01:18:54.029 --> 01:18:57.132
COMPLAINING OF VICTIM TO BE ABLE

01:18:57.199 --> 01:18:59.234
TO OBTAIN THIS INFORMATION --

01:18:59.301 --> 01:19:01.536
BUT TO BE ABLE TO TO SETTLE THIS

01:19:01.603 --> 01:19:03.371
CASE AGAINST AN EMPLOYER THEY'RE

01:19:03.438 --> 01:19:04.039
PROHIBITED FROM SAYING ANYTHING

01:19:04.106 --> 01:19:05.640
IN ORDER TO OBTAIN ANY TYPE OF

01:19:05.707 --> 01:19:05.874
RELIEF.

01:19:05.941 --> 01:19:07.642
AND I SEE THAT MY TIME IS UP I

01:19:07.709 --> 01:19:09.211
APOLOGIZE FOR THAT --

01:19:09.277 --> 01:19:09.811
THE ONLY OTHER TWO THINGS I

01:19:09.878 --> 01:19:11.580
WANTED TO MENTION WAS JUST UP

01:19:11.646 --> 01:19:13.615
THE ISSUE OF HOLDING EMPLOYERS

01:19:13.682 --> 01:19:13.949
ACCOUNTABLE.

01:19:14.015 --> 01:19:15.784
OF IN THESE LOW WAGE INDUSTRIES

01:19:15.851 --> 01:19:17.319
WE DO HAVE LOTS OF

01:19:17.385 --> 01:19:17.886
SUBCONTRACTORS SO OBVIOUSLY

01:19:17.953 --> 01:19:19.521
JOINT LIABILITY IS IMPORTANT.

01:19:19.588 --> 01:19:21.756
AND FINAL POINT UNIONIZATION IS

01:19:21.823 --> 01:19:23.458
OBVIOUSLY AN IMPORTANT WAY TO

01:19:23.525 --> 01:19:33.201
PREVENT SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

01:19:33.268 --> 01:19:35.170

HARAP HARASSMENT HAPPENS IN ALL

01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:57.259

01:19:57.325 --> 01:19:57.792
PUBLIC NATURE OF OF THE

01:19:57.859 --> 01:19:59.494

CLEARLY THERE MAY BE OTHER WAYS

01:23:43.118 --> 01:23:44.853
TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE --

01:23:44.919 --> 01:23:48.656

01:23:58.700 --> 01:23:59.234
FOR THE CUSTOMER TO GRAB YOUR

01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:02.637
* SO --

01:24:02.704 --> 01:24:04.639
AND DOES DOES THAT'S EXACTLY

01:24:04.706 --> 01:24:05.240
WHAT I WAS THINKING OF WHEN I

01:24:05.306 --> 01:24:06.841
SEE [INAUDIBLE]

01:24:06.908 --> 01:24:08.676
THANK YOU.

01:24:08.743 --> 01:24:11.012
I THINK YOU ALL FOR FOR YOUR

01:24:11.079 --> 01:24:13.081
COMMENTS YOU CERTAINLY PROVIDED.

01:24:13.148 --> 01:24:15.083
UNDER RAY HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS

01:24:15.150 --> 01:24:17.252
ON BOTH POLICY IDEAS AND THEN

01:24:17.318 --> 01:24:20.855
LEGISLATIVE IDEAS AND I DO HAVE

01:24:20.922 --> 01:24:22.791
A QUESTION IN THINKING ABOUT.

01:24:22.857 --> 01:24:24.959
THE LAWS THAT CURRENTLY ARE IN

01:24:25.026 --> 01:24:26.961
PLACE AND A COUPLE OF YOU

01:24:27.028 --> 01:24:28.830
MENTIONED ENFORCEMENT OR LACK

01:24:28.897 --> 01:24:29.097
THEREOF.

01:24:29.164 --> 01:24:31.132
THAT CAN YOU SPEAK A LITTLE BIT

01:24:31.199 --> 01:24:33.001
MORE TO THAT IF YOU KNOW WHAT

01:24:33.067 --> 01:24:34.702
WILL IT TAKE.

01:24:34.769 --> 01:24:36.938
I WHETHER IT'S FROM AN

01:24:37.005 --> 01:24:40.675
EMPLOYER'S PERSPECTIVE OR FROM

01:24:40.742 --> 01:24:41.242
THE STATE'S PERSPECTIVE TO

01:24:41.309 --> 01:24:42.844
ENFORCE THE CURRENT LAWS THAT WE

01:24:42.911 --> 01:24:45.013
HAVE IN PLACE THAT ARE SUPPOSED

01:24:45.079 --> 01:24:45.313
TO PROTECT.

01:24:45.380 --> 01:24:47.115
WORKERS AT THIS MOMENT WHAT IS

01:24:47.182 --> 01:24:50.718
IT WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE.

01:24:50.785 --> 01:24:52.854
BUT I THINK OF AS SOON AS WE

01:24:52.921 --> 01:24:54.656
KNOW UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW THE

01:24:54.722 --> 01:24:55.123
SEXUAL HARASSMENT --

01:24:55.190 --> 01:24:58.927
LAWS THAT GOVERN IS THE FAIR

01:24:58.993 --> 01:25:00.628
EMPLOYMENT HOUSING ACT.

01:25:00.695 --> 01:25:02.630
AND THERE IS ONLY.

01:25:02.697 --> 01:25:04.632
REALLY A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.

01:25:04.699 --> 01:25:06.601
SO IT'S NOT --

01:25:06.668 --> 01:25:07.235
YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THERE IS THE

01:25:07.302 --> 01:25:08.736
DEPARTMENT OF EMPLOYMENT HOUSING

01:25:08.803 --> 01:25:09.270
AND WE HAVE AN EXCELLENT

01:25:09.337 --> 01:25:10.839
DIRECTOR AND KEVIN KISH.

01:25:10.905 --> 01:25:12.774
BUT THE AGENCY'S ROLE AND

01:25:12.841 --> 01:25:14.609
FUNCTION IS TO TAKE THE

01:25:14.676 --> 01:25:15.276
COMPLAINTS WITHIN THE STATUTE OF

01:25:15.343 --> 01:25:16.978
LIMITATIONS THEY CAN CONDUCT --

01:25:17.045 --> 01:25:18.880
AN INVESTIGATION IF THEY CHOOSE

01:25:18.947 --> 01:25:20.882
TO OF I THINK IT --

01:25:20.949 --> 01:25:22.684
IN SOME CASES THEY ARE

01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:23.251
LITIGATING BUT THEY ARE NOT

01:25:23.318 --> 01:25:26.688
OBLIGATED TO TAKE ANY CASE TO

01:25:26.754 --> 01:25:26.921
COURT.

01:25:26.988 --> 01:25:28.723
AND MORE OFTEN THAN NOT THEY

01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:29.390
WILL THEN THEY MAY CONDUCT THEY

01:25:29.457 --> 01:25:30.925
CONDUCT WHAT MANY MORE

01:25:30.992 --> 01:25:32.727
INVESTIGATIONS NOW THE ISSUE

01:25:32.794 --> 01:25:33.361
RIGHT TO SUE LETTERS AND THEN

01:25:33.428 --> 01:25:34.929
THE WORKER HAS TO GO OUT AND

01:25:34.996 --> 01:25:36.664
FIND THEIR OWN.

01:25:36.731 --> 01:25:38.666
ATTORNEY TO FILE A LAWSUIT.

01:25:38.733 --> 01:25:40.902
AND I THINK YOUR QUESTION IS ONE

01:25:40.969 --> 01:25:42.637
THAT -- NON

01:25:42.704 --> 01:25:44.739
ATTORNEY ADVOCATES HAVE BEEN

01:25:44.806 --> 01:25:46.708
REALLY DISCUSSING FOR AWHILE YOU

01:25:46.774 --> 01:25:48.776
KNOW IT IN THEIR MINDS I THINK

01:25:48.843 --> 01:25:50.645
YOU KNOW OF A LOT OF WORKER

01:25:50.712 --> 01:25:51.279
RIGHTS FOLKS DO A LOT OF YOUR

01:25:51.346 --> 01:25:52.680
TRADITIONAL.

01:25:52.747 --> 01:25:54.649
MAYBE WAGING OUR LABOR

01:25:54.716 --> 01:25:55.283
VIOLATIONS WHERE YOU GO TO THE

01:25:55.350 --> 01:25:56.818
STATE AND THE STATE ENFORCES

01:25:56.885 --> 01:25:58.686
THOSE LAWS.

01:25:58.753 --> 01:26:00.655
AND I KNOW THAT WORKER ADVOCATES

01:26:00.722 --> 01:26:02.724
WOULD LIKE SOMETHING SIMILAR IN

01:26:02.790 --> 01:26:04.659
THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT --

01:26:04.726 --> 01:26:04.993
ARENA -- AND

01:26:05.059 --> 01:26:08.830
AND I AND I DIRECTOR I'M BUT I

01:26:08.897 --> 01:26:10.865
THINK THE WAY THE LAW IS SET UP

01:26:10.932 --> 01:26:12.734
NOW AND THE THE ENFORCEMENT IS

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:13.368
THROUGH PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION

01:26:13.434 --> 01:26:16.671
AND SO I THINK --

01:26:16.738 --> 01:26:18.873
IT IN TERMS OF OF OF ENFORCEMENT

01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:20.575
IT IT HAS TO BE THE INDIVIDUAL

01:26:20.642 --> 01:26:22.577
ON THEIR OWN FINDING AN ATTORNEY

01:26:22.644 --> 01:26:23.211
TO ENFORCE THE LAW AND TO AND TO

01:26:23.278 --> 01:26:25.113
SPEND TO SUE AN EMPLOYER --

01:26:25.179 --> 01:26:27.181
AYE AT IN TERMS OF A DETERRENT

01:26:27.248 --> 01:26:29.050
EFFECT ON EMPLOYERS I MEAN I

01:26:29.117 --> 01:26:30.618
THINK.

01:26:30.685 --> 01:26:32.587
YOU KNOW THE PENALTIES OR

01:26:32.654 --> 01:26:34.756
PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR THEIR YOU

01:26:34.822 --> 01:26:36.724
KNOW A WORKER CAN GET DAMAGES.

01:26:36.791 --> 01:26:38.660
OF NOT ONLY THEIR ECONOMIC BUT

01:26:38.726 --> 01:26:39.127
PAIN AND SUFFERING --

01:26:39.193 --> 01:26:40.828
SO.

01:26:40.895 --> 01:26:42.897
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT MIGHT

01:26:42.964 --> 01:26:44.799
BE AT THIS POINT IS THE ONLY

01:26:44.866 --> 01:26:46.868
DETERRENT THE THE THE ADDITIONAL

01:26:46.935 --> 01:26:48.937
OBLIGATIONS THAT YOU PLACE ON

01:26:49.003 --> 01:26:50.605
EMPLOYERS IN THE FACT THAT THEY

01:26:50.672 --> 01:26:51.039
COULD BE SUBJECT --

01:26:51.105 --> 01:26:52.674
TO ADDITIONAL DAMAGES BUT

01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:54.943
OTHERWISE IF YOU WANTED THE

01:26:55.009 --> 01:26:56.644
STATE TO ENFORCE YOU'D HAVE.

01:26:56.711 --> 01:26:58.646
TO REWRITE THE ENTIRE SYSTEM.

01:26:58.713 --> 01:27:01.049
SO YOU KNOW I JUST I WANT TO

01:27:01.115 --> 01:27:01.683
FOLLOW UP ON THAT BECAUSE THIS

01:27:01.749 --> 01:27:04.886
IS AN ON GOING. THIRTY EIGHTY

01:27:04.953 --> 01:27:05.486
ONE IN A NUMBER OF OTHER BILLS

01:27:05.553 --> 01:27:06.688
WE TRIED --

01:27:06.754 --> 01:27:08.823
TO GOD BLESS BE HAVE BUT COMING

01:27:08.890 --> 01:27:09.357
FROM LABOR MOVEMENT I WANT

01:27:09.424 --> 01:27:10.892
EVERYTHING A LABOR CODE --

01:27:10.959 --> 01:27:14.796
WE WERE ATTEMPTING TO TO PUT

01:27:14.862 --> 01:27:15.463
SOME OF THIS INTO THE LABOR CODE

01:27:15.530 --> 01:27:17.065
AND ARE GETTING A LOT OF PUSH

01:27:17.131 --> 01:27:18.900
BACK DO YOU THINK THAT WE HAVE

01:27:18.967 --> 01:27:19.534
TO ACTUALLY RE WRITE ALL OF THE

01:27:19.601 --> 01:27:20.868
SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

01:27:20.935 --> 01:27:22.904
CLAIMS OR COULD WE DO SOME OF

01:27:22.971 --> 01:27:23.471
THE RETALIATION SOME OF THE

01:27:23.538 --> 01:27:24.839
INITIAL RETALIATION [INAUDIBLE]

01:27:24.906 --> 01:27:28.876
AND JOINT LIABILITY THINGS THAT

01:27:28.943 --> 01:27:29.544
WE'RE GOING THROUGH AND PUT THEM

01:27:29.611 --> 01:27:30.678
INTO.

01:27:30.745 --> 01:27:33.047
THE LABOR CODE INSTEAD OF FEET

01:27:33.114 --> 01:27:36.651
UP AS SMEARING THE HAT AS A WAY

01:27:36.718 --> 01:27:36.951
TO ALLOW --

01:27:37.018 --> 01:27:37.585
THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE

01:27:37.652 --> 01:27:39.020
IF WE FUNDED A BETTER TO

01:27:39.087 --> 01:27:40.622
ACTUALLY --

01:27:40.688 --> 01:27:42.790
AND FOR SOME OF THESE OR ARE WE

01:27:42.857 --> 01:27:44.592
JUST OPENED UP A PANDORA'S BOX.

01:27:44.659 --> 01:27:46.828
WELL I I MEAN I DON'T WORK AT

01:27:46.894 --> 01:27:48.796
THE DMV AGE SO I'M NOT I I DON'T

01:27:48.863 --> 01:27:49.464
KNOW WHAT THEIR POSITION IS BUT

01:27:49.530 --> 01:27:52.867
I THINK THE THE IF I WORKED AT

01:27:52.934 --> 01:27:55.069
THE AT AT AT THE DEALERS HERE OR

01:27:55.136 --> 01:27:57.238
IF I WERE THE LABOR COMMISSIONER.

01:27:57.305 --> 01:27:59.007
ABOUT WHAT I WOULD THINK IS MY

01:27:59.073 --> 01:28:00.908
EXPERTISE IS ENFORCING THE LABOR

01:28:00.975 --> 01:28:02.844
CODE WHICH IS THE WAGE AND HOUR

01:28:02.910 --> 01:28:04.679
LAWS AND THE D. F. B. H. AND

01:28:04.746 --> 01:28:06.781
EXPERTISE AS SEXUAL HARASSMENT

01:28:06.848 --> 01:28:08.716
AND HAS BEEN SO.

01:28:08.783 --> 01:28:09.350
UP I'M SURE THAT THERE MAY BE A

01:28:09.417 --> 01:28:12.887
WHICH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER MAY

01:28:12.954 --> 01:28:14.756
BE ABLE TO ENFORCE --

01:28:14.822 --> 01:28:16.791
APPROVED PROVISIONS RELATED TO

01:28:16.858 --> 01:28:18.960
SEXUAL HARASSMENT LIKE IT DOES

01:28:19.027 --> 01:28:21.029
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT IT

01:28:21.095 --> 01:28:22.630
MEAN IT IS A REGISTRY.

01:28:22.697 --> 01:28:23.231
THAT REQUIRE YOU KNOW THE THE

01:28:23.297 --> 01:28:24.666
JANITORIAL CONTRACTORS ARE

01:28:24.732 --> 01:28:28.603
REQUIRED TO REGISTER OF WITH OF

01:28:28.670 --> 01:28:30.738
THE DLC WITH THE DIR AND THE

01:28:30.805 --> 01:28:31.406
LABOR COMMISSIONER HAS POWER TO

01:28:31.472 --> 01:28:32.907
ENFORCE THOSE PROVISIONS OF OF

01:28:32.974 --> 01:28:36.711
OF NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT AND IT

01:28:36.778 --> 01:28:38.646
REQUIRES THIS TRAINING PROGRAM

01:28:38.713 --> 01:28:40.715
THAT'S BEING DEVELOPED WITH THE

01:28:40.782 --> 01:28:41.049
AGENCY -- SO

01:28:41.115 --> 01:28:43.017
YOU DO HAVE THAT SOMETHING LIKE

01:28:43.084 --> 01:28:45.086
THAT NOW IN PLACE WITH THE LABOR

01:28:45.153 --> 01:28:46.921
COMMISSIONER I THINK THE ISSUE

01:28:46.988 --> 01:28:48.656
REALLY COMES DOWN TO IF YOU DO

01:28:48.723 --> 01:28:49.290
ANY ANYTHING MORE THAN THAT IS

01:28:49.357 --> 01:28:50.692
THAT.

01:28:50.758 --> 01:28:52.727
WHO HAS THE EXPERTISE IN THE

01:28:52.794 --> 01:28:54.662
AREA AND AND IN TERMS OF SEXUAL

01:28:54.729 --> 01:28:55.263
HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION

01:28:55.329 --> 01:28:56.698
LAWS?

01:28:56.764 --> 01:28:57.231
IT IS THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:28:57.298 --> 01:28:59.033
EMPLOYMENT HOUSING AS OPPOSED TO

01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:02.704
THE LABOR COMMISSION.

01:29:02.770 --> 01:29:04.706
I JUST WANTED TO ADD TO THAT.

01:29:04.772 --> 01:29:06.674
I THINK STRENGTHENING MECHANISMS

01:29:06.741 --> 01:29:08.743
FOR ENFORCEMENT IS VERY KEY FOR

01:29:08.810 --> 01:29:09.410
REALLY GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF

01:29:09.477 --> 01:29:10.878
ALL THIS NOT ONLY FOR SEXUAL

01:29:10.945 --> 01:29:12.680
HARASSMENT BUT FOR OTHER TYPES

01:29:12.747 --> 01:29:14.716
OF SEX DISCRIMINATION.

01:29:14.782 --> 01:29:15.383
TO FOR DISCRIMINATION IN HIRING

01:29:15.450 --> 01:29:16.951
AND PROMOTION AND PAY AND AS

01:29:17.018 --> 01:29:18.820
THESE -- THE

01:29:18.886 --> 01:29:20.955
STANFORD LAW REVIEW ARTICLE

01:29:21.022 --> 01:29:22.857
POINTS OUT TIME AND TIME AGAIN

01:29:22.924 --> 01:29:24.759
THE TWO GO HAND IN HAND YOU

01:29:24.826 --> 01:29:26.694
DON'T GET A WORKPLACE --

01:29:26.761 --> 01:29:28.863
THAT IS NOT ENGAGING IN OTHER

01:29:28.930 --> 01:29:30.765
TYPES OF SEXUAL DISCRIMINATION --

01:29:30.832 --> 01:29:32.900
YOU ALSO GET THAT THE SEXUAL

01:29:32.967 --> 01:29:35.069
HARASSMENT IS PART AND PARCEL OF

01:29:35.136 --> 01:29:35.636
BANNING SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS

01:29:35.703 --> 01:29:36.671
DISCRIMINATION --

01:29:36.738 --> 01:29:39.040
AND SO STRENGTHENING THE STATE'S

01:29:39.107 --> 01:29:40.942
ABILITY TO ENFORCE WHETHER

01:29:41.008 --> 01:29:42.944
THAT'S AND I TIME NOT AN

01:29:43.010 --> 01:29:44.746
ATTORNEY SO I I CAN'T.

01:29:44.812 --> 01:29:48.616
SAY IN TERMS OF THE TERMINATION

01:29:48.683 --> 01:29:50.651
LAWS OF THE LABOR LAWS BUT I

01:29:50.718 --> 01:29:51.285
THINK IT'S WORTH TAKING A HARD

01:29:51.352 --> 01:29:54.622
LOOK BECAUSE UNTIL WE BEGAN --

01:29:54.689 --> 01:29:56.724
TO ENSURE THAT WOMEN ARE NOT

01:29:56.791 --> 01:29:58.626
RELEGATED TO ONLY THE LOWEST

01:29:58.693 --> 01:30:00.695
POSITIONS IN THE LOWEST PAY AND

01:30:00.762 --> 01:30:02.663
SEGREGATED IN THE WORKPLACE.

01:30:02.730 --> 01:30:03.197
WE CAN'T REALLY GET IT.

01:30:03.264 --> 01:30:06.701
SEXUAL HARASSMENT OVERALL --

01:30:06.768 --> 01:30:07.335
I JUST I DON'T WANT TO MENTION

01:30:07.401 --> 01:30:10.671
THAT.

01:30:10.738 --> 01:30:14.642
ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF AND SALAS

01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:14.909
FLETCHER.

01:30:14.976 --> 01:30:16.744
THAT I SAW THE CONNECTION BACK

01:30:16.811 --> 01:30:18.713
AND FORTH BETWEEN THE PIECE OF

01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:19.380
LEGISLATION THAT YOU PASSED WITH

01:30:19.447 --> 01:30:20.681
THE JANITORS.

01:30:20.748 --> 01:30:24.685
AND WHAT THEY HAVE IMPLEMENTED.

01:30:24.752 --> 01:30:25.219
WHAT THEY IMPLEMENTED WAS

01:30:25.286 --> 01:30:26.687
ENFORCEMENT?

01:30:26.754 --> 01:30:28.689
THE PROMOTE BOUGHT US.

01:30:28.756 --> 01:30:31.058
I THINK THERE'S GOT TO BE

01:30:31.125 --> 01:30:32.794
ANOTHER WAY OF ENFORCING AND NOT

01:30:32.860 --> 01:30:34.929
ONLY TO RELY ON HOW MANY.

01:30:34.996 --> 01:30:36.931
INSPECTORS THE STATE HIRES

01:30:36.998 --> 01:30:39.033
BECAUSE WILL NEVER DO IT'LL

01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:40.701
NEVER HAPPEN.

01:30:40.768 --> 01:30:41.369
AND I'M SURE IT'S A SOURCE OF

01:30:41.435 --> 01:30:43.037
FRUSTRATION FOR MANY OF YOU WHO

01:30:43.104 --> 01:30:44.906
PASSED THESE GOOD LAWS IS THAT

01:30:44.972 --> 01:30:46.741
THEY SIT ON THE BOOKS AND

01:30:46.808 --> 01:30:48.643
MEANWHILE EVERY SINGLE DAY

01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:49.177
THERE'S HUNDREDS IF NOT

01:30:49.243 --> 01:30:51.012
THOUSANDS OF VIOLATION SO.

01:30:51.078 --> 01:30:54.849
I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK

01:30:54.916 --> 01:30:56.784
OF I MEAN AS YOU PASS THESE LAWS

01:30:56.851 --> 01:30:58.619
WHO IS IT CONNECTED WITH.

01:30:58.686 --> 01:31:00.721
THAT WILL HELP ENFORCE.

01:31:00.788 --> 01:31:02.924
IF I THINK FOR EXAMPLE IN THE

01:31:02.990 --> 01:31:04.625
CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY.

01:31:04.692 --> 01:31:08.696
THERE IS A WAY --

01:31:08.763 --> 01:31:12.600
FOR EXPERTS ON IN CONSTRUCTION

01:31:12.667 --> 01:31:14.769
TO GO IN AND THEN FORCE AND THEY

01:31:14.836 --> 01:31:16.671
HAVE TO BE RESPECTED AND AND

01:31:16.737 --> 01:31:18.773
ALLOWED ONTO THE PROPERTY --

01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:21.042
BY THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN SORT OF I

01:31:21.108 --> 01:31:21.509
DON'T KNOW [INAUDIBLE]

01:31:21.576 --> 01:31:22.643
DEPUTIZED.

01:31:22.710 --> 01:31:24.879
BUT THERE'S GOT BE A WAY OF

01:31:24.946 --> 01:31:26.647
DEPUTISING.

01:31:26.714 --> 01:31:28.850
A LOT MORE PEOPLE OR IT'S NEVER

01:31:28.916 --> 01:31:29.483
GOING TO HAPPEN AND WE'RE GOING

01:31:29.550 --> 01:31:30.751
TO BE.

01:31:30.818 --> 01:31:32.620
FEELING GREAT BECAUSE WE PASSED

01:31:32.687 --> 01:31:34.622
THE LAW AND THEY'RE STILL --

01:31:34.689 --> 01:31:36.657
THOUSANDS OF VIOLATIONS.

01:31:36.724 --> 01:31:38.960
I WOULD ADD MAKE ANOTHER WOULD

01:31:39.026 --> 01:31:40.661
BE.

01:31:40.728 --> 01:31:41.362
TO I MEAN ONE OF THE ISSUES WITH

01:31:41.429 --> 01:31:42.730
THE F. B. AGE AND THE FACT THAT

01:31:42.797 --> 01:31:43.397
THERE IS ONLY A PRIVATE RIGHT OF

01:31:43.464 --> 01:31:45.032
ACTION IS THAT THEY HAVE LIMITED

01:31:45.099 --> 01:31:48.669
RESOURCES TO TAKE CASES TO COURT.

01:31:48.736 --> 01:31:50.638
SO IF IF WE'RE LOOKING AT AN

01:31:50.705 --> 01:31:51.305
EASIER FIX ON STATE IN FORCE AND

01:31:51.372 --> 01:31:52.974
THAT DOESN'T CHANGE THE ENTIRE

01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:55.109
SYSTEM BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'D

01:31:55.176 --> 01:31:56.944
BE DOING AYE I BELIEVE YOU HAVE

01:31:57.011 --> 01:31:57.545
HAD THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH

01:31:57.612 --> 01:32:00.648
ADVOCATES ON HOW TO DO THAT --

01:32:00.715 --> 01:32:02.750
IT WOULD BE FUNDING DFB AGE THAT

01:32:02.817 --> 01:32:03.417
THEY CAN HIRE MORE LAWYERS TO BE

01:32:03.484 --> 01:32:05.152
ABLE TO TAKE MORE CASES TO COURT

01:32:05.219 --> 01:32:06.687
I MEAN THAT SEEMS TO ME LIKE.

01:32:06.754 --> 01:32:10.725
THE EASIER ALL THE FIXES BUT ONE

01:32:10.791 --> 01:32:12.793
THING WE'D LIKE TO SEE A LOOK

01:32:12.860 --> 01:32:14.662
THAT IS --

01:32:14.729 --> 01:32:15.263
EXTENDING THE LAW TO PROTECTS

01:32:15.329 --> 01:32:17.098
WORKERS FROM PREDATORS WHO HOLD

01:32:17.164 --> 01:32:18.599
THEMSELVES OUT.

01:32:18.666 --> 01:32:20.902
AS AS BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE A

01:32:20.968 --> 01:32:21.435
JOB SO WHEN YOU GO ON AN

01:32:21.502 --> 01:32:22.603
INTERVIEW OR IN ADDITION.

01:32:22.670 --> 01:32:24.872
THERE'S NO DIRECT EMPLOYMENT

01:32:24.939 --> 01:32:25.506
RELATIONSHIP AT THAT MOMENT IN

01:32:25.573 --> 01:32:27.008
OUR INDUSTRY WHEN YOU GO ON AN

01:32:27.074 --> 01:32:28.576
AUDITION THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF

01:32:28.643 --> 01:32:29.076
THESE OFFENSES ARE BEING

01:32:29.143 --> 01:32:30.711
COMMITTED.

01:32:30.778 --> 01:32:31.345
SO WE'D LIKE THERE TO BE SOME

01:32:31.412 --> 01:32:34.582
SOME LOOKING INTO TO HOW WE CAN

01:32:34.649 --> 01:32:36.817
EXPAND TO COVER THAT AS WELL.

01:32:36.884 --> 01:32:40.621
I DID BUT I DID WANT TO REMIND.

01:32:40.688 --> 01:32:41.255
I WAS JUST REMINDED THAT THE

01:32:41.322 --> 01:32:42.957
WOMEN'S CAUCUS DID REQUEST AN

01:32:43.024 --> 01:32:46.627
ADDITIONAL THREE MILLION DOLLARS.

01:32:46.694 --> 01:32:47.228
THE FDA'S TO DO TO HIRE MORE

01:32:47.295 --> 01:32:48.729
INVESTIGATORS.

01:32:48.796 --> 01:32:51.065
IT IS NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH BUT

01:32:51.132 --> 01:32:52.833
WE DO KNOW THAT THAT IS

01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:53.434
SOMETHING THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS

01:32:53.501 --> 01:32:55.069
SIZE A PRIORITY THEY DID

01:32:55.136 --> 01:32:55.636
REQUESTED IN SOMETHING THAT

01:32:55.703 --> 01:33:02.643
WE'RE GOING TO GET.

01:33:02.710 --> 01:33:03.277
I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR

01:33:03.344 --> 01:33:04.912
BEING HERE BECAUSE I'M JUST

01:33:04.979 --> 01:33:06.914
REALLY APPRECIATIVE OF ALL THE

01:33:06.981 --> 01:33:08.916
INFORMATION WE'RE TAKING AN

01:33:08.983 --> 01:33:09.383
WHICH IS PART OF OUR

01:33:09.450 --> 01:33:10.651
INFORMATIONAL HEARING.

01:33:10.718 --> 01:33:12.820
BUT AS AN EDUCATOR FOR THIRTY

01:33:12.887 --> 01:33:14.922
YEARS UP LEARNING THE

01:33:14.989 --> 01:33:16.691
INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT BUT

01:33:16.757 --> 01:33:18.659
THAT ACTUALLY TAKING THAT.

01:33:18.726 --> 01:33:20.695
OUT TO WHERE WE NEED TO IS AS

01:33:20.761 --> 01:33:22.630
IMPORTANT LIKE YOU SAY WE PASSED

01:33:22.697 --> 01:33:24.699
MANY MANY LAWS SOMETIMES THERE --

01:33:24.765 --> 01:33:26.934
WE IN THE WEEDS IF YOU WANT TO

01:33:27.001 --> 01:33:28.836
SAY THAT LEGISLATORS ARE REALLY

01:33:28.903 --> 01:33:30.671
THE ONLY ONES WHO KNOW ABOUT IT.

01:33:30.738 --> 01:33:32.907
AND SO ONE OF MY SITES IS WE'RE

01:33:32.974 --> 01:33:34.842
TALKING ABOUT HOW TO IN FOUR

01:33:34.909 --> 01:33:36.844
HOURS AND HOW TO ADD ADDITIONAL

01:33:36.911 --> 01:33:39.080
FUNDING TO REALLY USE THE HAMMER

01:33:39.146 --> 01:33:41.148
AS WE KNOW SOMETIMES WE NEED.

01:33:41.215 --> 01:33:43.017
TO BUT I WANTED TO FLIP THE

01:33:43.084 --> 01:33:44.986
EQUATION AND FIND OUT IS THEIR

01:33:45.052 --> 01:33:46.954
WORK BEING DONE ON THE EDUCATION

01:33:47.021 --> 01:33:49.156
PART I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THE

01:33:49.223 --> 01:33:50.791
PROMONTORY IS ALREADY WHEN

01:33:50.858 --> 01:33:52.827
PEOPLE ARE ADULTS BUT MUCH OF

01:33:52.893 --> 01:33:53.127
THIS -- AYE

01:33:53.194 --> 01:33:56.931
EVERYONE OF US OUT UNLESS I HAVE

01:33:56.998 --> 01:34:00.668
TWO YOUNG ADULT SONS --

01:34:00.735 --> 01:34:01.369
WHETHER WERE ANSWER GRANDMOTHERS

01:34:01.435 --> 01:34:02.703
ARE SISTERS.

01:34:02.770 --> 01:34:04.772
AND I WOULD NOT WANT TO SUGGEST

01:34:04.839 --> 01:34:06.741
WE SHOULD BE DOING THIS IN

01:34:06.807 --> 01:34:08.709
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BECAUSE AS A

01:34:08.776 --> 01:34:08.976
TEACHER.

01:34:09.043 --> 01:34:10.911
WE KEEP LAYERING AND LAYERING

01:34:10.978 --> 01:34:12.747
THE SUICIDE PREVENTION AND

01:34:12.813 --> 01:34:14.915
DEPRESSION ABUSE AND TEACHERS

01:34:14.982 --> 01:34:16.884
CAN READ IT OUT WE HAD YET

01:34:16.951 --> 01:34:18.586
ANOTHER THING --

01:34:18.652 --> 01:34:19.186
THAT THERE'S MANY THINGS TO

01:34:19.253 --> 01:34:22.757
EDUCATION BUT EVEN SOME TYPE OF

01:34:22.823 --> 01:34:24.959
CAMPAIGN OR THE SERIES THAT CAN

01:34:25.026 --> 01:34:27.028
BE TAKEN DIRECTLY TO THE PUBLIC

01:34:27.094 --> 01:34:28.896
WHETHER IT'S ON FACEBOOK WHETHER

01:34:28.963 --> 01:34:30.965
IT'S IN UNIONS BUT TO MOTHERS

01:34:31.032 --> 01:34:32.867
AND TO FATHERS.

01:34:32.933 --> 01:34:34.969
OF HOW DO YOU TALK TO YOUR SONS

01:34:35.036 --> 01:34:36.937
AND DAUGHTERS BECAUSE LIKE YOU

01:34:37.004 --> 01:34:38.672
SAY IT'S NOT JUST WHAT.

01:34:38.739 --> 01:34:40.641
ABOUT HOW DO YOU NOT ONLY

01:34:40.708 --> 01:34:41.242
RESPECT WOMEN BUT HOW DO YOU

01:34:41.308 --> 01:34:42.977
RESPECT EACH OTHER BECAUSE THIS

01:34:43.044 --> 01:34:45.046
IS A LARGER CONVERSATION.

01:34:45.112 --> 01:34:46.947
THAT THE THEMES ARE ABOUT RACISM

01:34:47.014 --> 01:34:48.883
THE THEMES ARE ABOUT --

01:34:48.949 --> 01:34:51.052
NOT ONLY SEXUAL HARASSMENT BUT

01:34:51.118 --> 01:34:54.822
ABOUT ABUSE THINGS ABOUT WHEN WE

01:34:54.889 --> 01:34:56.724
LOOK AT OUR TOP LEADERSHIP IN

01:34:56.791 --> 01:34:58.893
THE UNITED STATES AND AND YOUNG

01:34:58.959 --> 01:35:01.028
CHILDREN ARE WATCHING THAT EVERY

01:35:01.095 --> 01:35:04.665
SINGLE DAY AND THEY SAY WELL IF

01:35:04.732 --> 01:35:05.266
HE CAN DO WHAT I CAN DO IT.

01:35:05.332 --> 01:35:07.001
WHEN WE SEE IT DISMISSED AND A

01:35:07.068 --> 01:35:10.671
VERY LIGHT HEARTED WAY THAT NO

01:35:10.738 --> 01:35:11.205
THIS JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN?

01:35:11.272 --> 01:35:14.775
SO I WHILE I WOULD LOVE TO BE

01:35:14.842 --> 01:35:16.944
PART OF THE WAY TO REALLY WORK

01:35:17.011 --> 01:35:18.979
ON THIS SO WE CAN GET TO EARLY

01:35:19.046 --> 01:35:22.750
CHILDHOOD SO WE CAN GET LIKE YOU

01:35:22.817 --> 01:35:23.384
SAY WHETHER IT'S TOYS ARE THE

01:35:23.451 --> 01:35:26.687
WAY I ONE PERSON THAT I RESPECT --

01:35:26.754 --> 01:35:28.656
FOR TRULY IS --

01:35:28.722 --> 01:35:30.591
FROM ORANGE COUNTY HUMAN

01:35:30.658 --> 01:35:30.925
RELATIONS --

01:35:30.991 --> 01:35:34.695
A RUSTY KENNEDY WHO ONCE SAID

01:35:34.762 --> 01:35:36.664
MANY YEARS AGO BEFORE --

01:35:36.730 --> 01:35:37.231
SOME OF THESE TOPICS HAVE

01:35:37.298 --> 01:35:39.100
EMERGED TO THIS LEVEL WAS WHEN

01:35:39.166 --> 01:35:42.603
YOU SEE RACISM WHEN YOU STAND BY

01:35:42.670 --> 01:35:43.170
AND WATCH IT YOU'RE JUST AS

01:35:43.237 --> 01:35:44.638
GUILTY.

01:35:44.705 --> 01:35:46.807
SO IT'S LIKE THE BYSTANDERS

01:35:46.874 --> 01:35:48.909
WHETHER IT'S THE CHILD ON THE

01:35:48.976 --> 01:35:51.011
SCHOOL YARD OR THEN EMERGES TO

01:35:51.078 --> 01:35:52.680
JUNIOR HIGH AND HIGH SCHOOL AND

01:35:52.746 --> 01:35:54.648
YOU SEE YOUNG KIDS FILMING.

01:35:54.715 --> 01:35:56.717
THESE HATEFUL INCIDENTS WHETHER

01:35:56.784 --> 01:35:57.318
IT'S HARASSMENTS OR EVEN MORE

01:35:57.384 --> 01:35:58.652
RATE.

01:35:58.719 --> 01:36:00.855
THIS IS A CULTURAL ISSUE HOW DID

01:36:00.921 --> 01:36:02.690
WE GET HERE AND WHAT DO WE DO TO

01:36:02.756 --> 01:36:04.658
EDUCATE TO GET OUT OF THAT.

01:36:04.725 --> 01:36:05.126
WE NEED TO HAMMER FOR

01:36:05.192 --> 01:36:06.894
ENFORCEMENT BUT LET'S TURN IT

01:36:06.961 --> 01:36:08.996
AROUND AND START LOOKING AT

01:36:09.063 --> 01:36:09.296
PREVENTION.

01:36:09.363 --> 01:36:11.031
ACTUALLY SCHOOLS HAVE THE NOVEL

01:36:11.098 --> 01:36:14.635
TITLE --

01:36:14.702 --> 01:36:16.637
NINE BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE --

01:36:16.704 --> 01:36:18.639
TO ELIMINATE A HOSTILE

01:36:18.706 --> 01:36:19.273
ENVIRONMENT FOR THEIR STUDENTS

01:36:19.340 --> 01:36:21.075
AND AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS ONE

01:36:21.142 --> 01:36:22.843
OF THEM [INAUDIBLE]

01:36:22.910 --> 01:36:24.678
THERE.

01:36:24.745 --> 01:36:26.747
SO -- AGAIN

01:36:26.814 --> 01:36:27.348
I MEAN CALIFORNIA HAS A GREAT

01:36:27.414 --> 01:36:28.716
TITLE NINE LAW --

01:36:28.782 --> 01:36:30.784
THE QUESTION IS --

01:36:30.851 --> 01:36:32.887
IS MONEY BEING ALLOCATED FOR

01:36:32.953 --> 01:36:34.655
ENFORCEMENT --

01:36:34.722 --> 01:36:38.659
AND AND IT IS AN OBLIGATION OF

01:36:38.726 --> 01:36:40.728
TEACHERS OF ADMINISTRATORS OF

01:36:40.794 --> 01:36:42.897
PRINCIPLES AND ALL UP THE CHAIN

01:36:42.963 --> 01:36:45.065
NAM IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM

01:36:45.132 --> 01:36:46.967
THAT THEY HAVE GOT TO BE.

01:36:47.034 --> 01:36:48.736
PRE VENTING --

01:36:48.802 --> 01:36:50.905
DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT AS

01:36:50.971 --> 01:36:52.940
WELL AS DEALING WITH IT WHEN

01:36:53.007 --> 01:36:54.642
THEY SEE IT THEY ALREADY HAVE AN

01:36:54.708 --> 01:36:55.276
OBLIGATION WE WE SHOULD DIE PUT

01:36:55.342 --> 01:36:56.710
MORE.

01:36:56.777 --> 01:36:59.046
PRESSURE AND RESOURCES IN THAT

01:36:59.113 --> 01:37:02.716
DIRECTION.

01:37:02.783 --> 01:37:04.718
TO YOU THINK YOU KNOW MY ALMOST

01:37:04.785 --> 01:37:06.754
FELT LIKE --

01:37:06.820 --> 01:37:07.388
MISS QUIRK SILVA RIGHT OFF OF MY

01:37:07.454 --> 01:37:07.988
MY THOUGHTS COULDN'T A LOT OF

01:37:08.055 --> 01:37:10.624
MONEY.

01:37:10.691 --> 01:37:11.225
A LOT OF MY FEELINGS TO WERE

01:37:11.292 --> 01:37:12.826
ABOUT A CULTURAL CHANGE IN IN

01:37:12.893 --> 01:37:13.460
NIGHT RECOGNIZE THAT THE FACT

01:37:13.527 --> 01:37:14.895
THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DO.

01:37:14.962 --> 01:37:16.764
PARTICULAR WHEN YOU HAVE

01:37:16.830 --> 01:37:17.398
ADMINISTRATION THAT'S GONE AWAY

01:37:17.464 --> 01:37:20.801
WITH LANGUAGE THAT I I CAN'T

01:37:20.868 --> 01:37:21.335
UNDERSTAND TO THIS DAY HOW

01:37:21.402 --> 01:37:22.803
THERE'S A DOUBLE STANDARD IN

01:37:22.870 --> 01:37:24.738
THAT BUT HAVING SAID THAT.

01:37:24.805 --> 01:37:25.339
YUMMY COURAGE TO KNOW THAT WE

01:37:25.406 --> 01:37:26.840
CAN DO AT THIS POINT IN TIME

01:37:26.907 --> 01:37:27.408
THINGS THAT WE THOUGHT WERE

01:37:27.474 --> 01:37:28.642
IMPOSSIBLE.

01:37:28.709 --> 01:37:29.009
A YEARS AGO --

01:37:29.076 --> 01:37:31.011
WHEN THIS GONZALEZ FLETCHER

01:37:31.078 --> 01:37:32.913
FIRST PROPOSED CO AUTHOR HERE I

01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:34.648
COULDN'T GET THE VOTES?

01:37:34.715 --> 01:37:36.984
I MEAN IT WAS THAT SIMPLE AND

01:37:37.051 --> 01:37:37.284
THAT HARD.

01:37:37.351 --> 01:37:38.652
THAT PEOPLE REALLY.

01:37:38.719 --> 01:37:40.854
PEOPLE IN OUR HOUSE REALLY

01:37:40.921 --> 01:37:42.756
THOUGHT THAT IT WAS GOING TO FAR

01:37:42.823 --> 01:37:44.725
TO GET THE VOTES TO PREVENT RAPE

01:37:44.792 --> 01:37:45.359
THAT WORKED I MEAN WE COULD EVEN

01:37:45.426 --> 01:37:46.994
BELIEVE SITTING ON THE FLOOR

01:37:47.061 --> 01:37:47.595
THAT THAT THAT WE WERE HAVING

01:37:47.661 --> 01:37:48.662
THIS CONVERSATION.

01:37:48.729 --> 01:37:50.631
AND SO WE'VE NOW GOT THIS

01:37:50.698 --> 01:37:52.633
OPPORTUNITY HERE TO GET THINGS

01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:53.167
THROUGH THAT WE COULD SEE

01:37:53.234 --> 01:37:53.434
POSSIBLE.

01:37:53.500 --> 01:37:54.668
BUT YOU HAVEN'T SAID THAT.

01:37:54.735 --> 01:37:56.904
WHAT I STRUGGLE WITH IT AND WE

01:37:56.971 --> 01:37:58.672
PASS?

01:37:58.739 --> 01:37:59.273
AND IT'S BEEN SAID BEFORE WE

01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:01.008
PASS LAWS AND IF YOU TOOK A LOOK

01:38:01.075 --> 01:38:02.776
AT ALL THE LAWS THAT WE PASSED

01:38:02.843 --> 01:38:03.410
ALREADY NONE OF IT SHOULD BE

01:38:03.477 --> 01:38:05.112
HAVING A MAYBE EVEN COMMON SENSE

01:38:05.179 --> 01:38:07.014
WOULD TELL YOU THAT THIS SHOULD

01:38:07.081 --> 01:38:07.581
NOT HAPPENING AND WE DON'T.

01:38:07.648 --> 01:38:08.682
WE DO NOT TOLERATE IT.

01:38:08.749 --> 01:38:10.884
AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE WE HAVE TO

01:38:10.951 --> 01:38:11.518
KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT ENFORCING

01:38:11.585 --> 01:38:13.187
LAWS WHEN NONE OF THIS SHOULD BE

01:38:13.254 --> 01:38:13.821
HAPPENING TO BEGIN WITH I THINK

01:38:13.887 --> 01:38:16.690
WILL AGREE WITH THAT.

01:38:16.757 --> 01:38:17.224
AND SO I WONDER IS THERE

01:38:17.291 --> 01:38:18.926
SOMETHING ELSE IN PARTICULAR

01:38:18.993 --> 01:38:20.761
WITH INDUSTRIES WHERE WE KNOW

01:38:20.828 --> 01:38:21.161
THIS IS PROBABLY.

01:38:21.228 --> 01:38:22.963
AND ALSO BE SPECIFICALLY TO

01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:24.898
MAYBE LOWER WAGE EARNERS WHERE

01:38:24.965 --> 01:38:26.734
YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR RIGHTS --

01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:28.669
YOU DON'T KNOW THE LANGUAGE FEAR

01:38:28.736 --> 01:38:29.270
DEPORTATION WE SEE THIS OUR

01:38:29.336 --> 01:38:31.005
COMMUNITIES WOULD BE SOMETHING

01:38:31.071 --> 01:38:32.906
ALL STRUCTURED IN ABOUT IT INTO

01:38:32.973 --> 01:38:34.742
THE BUSINESS LICENSE OUR

01:38:34.808 --> 01:38:36.644
BUSINESS MODEL BEFORE YOU ENTER --

01:38:36.710 --> 01:38:40.681
THIS A PARTICULAR INDUSTRY --

01:38:40.748 --> 01:38:41.282
TO SAY THAT YOU HAVE TO GET

01:38:41.348 --> 01:38:42.816
BONDED PREFERRED THIS IN CASE

01:38:42.883 --> 01:38:43.417
THIS HAPPENS BECAUSE THE ONLY

01:38:43.484 --> 01:38:45.052
WAY TO DETER SOMEBODY NAY AGREES

01:38:45.119 --> 01:38:45.653
WITH THE STIFFER PENALTIES AND

01:38:45.719 --> 01:38:46.587
IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THAT

01:38:46.654 --> 01:38:46.887
[INAUDIBLE]

01:38:46.954 --> 01:38:48.622
STILL.

01:38:48.689 --> 01:38:49.223
THAT HAVE TO BE THE ONLY WAY

01:38:49.290 --> 01:38:50.758
THAT WE CAN DO THAT I WANTED

01:38:50.824 --> 01:38:52.626
MUCH HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THOUGHT.

01:38:52.693 --> 01:38:54.728
WHERE WHERE THAT WHERE WE HAVE

01:38:54.795 --> 01:38:55.362
TO DO CULTURAL CHANGE BUT DO IT

01:38:55.429 --> 01:38:57.097
ON THE FRONT END SO THAT WE HOPE

01:38:57.164 --> 01:38:58.832
THAT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN ON THE

01:38:58.899 --> 01:38:59.366
BACKING THAT WERE CATCHING

01:38:59.433 --> 01:39:00.734
PEOPLE?

01:39:00.801 --> 01:39:01.402
COULD YOU IMAGINE A SYSTEM WHERE

01:39:01.468 --> 01:39:02.870
THERE'S AND I I DON'T KNOW WHAT

01:39:02.936 --> 01:39:03.470
IT WOULD BE RIGHT BUT HELP ME

01:39:03.537 --> 01:39:04.672
THINK --

01:39:04.738 --> 01:39:06.874
UPON SET UP IN THE IN THESE

01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:08.709
PARTICULAR INDUSTRIES A

01:39:08.776 --> 01:39:09.343
DIFFERENT SORT OF LICENSE AND

01:39:09.410 --> 01:39:10.744
INSURANCE OR SOMETHING STRICTER.

01:39:10.811 --> 01:39:13.080
BUT REGISTRY OR SOMETHING ON THE

01:39:13.147 --> 01:39:14.615
FRONT END SO THAT WE WE ATTACK

01:39:14.682 --> 01:39:14.782
IT.

01:39:14.848 --> 01:39:16.717
ON AND IT DOESN'T HAPPEN SOME

01:39:16.784 --> 01:39:18.686
THESE LOW WAGE INCOME --

01:39:18.752 --> 01:39:20.754
INDUSTRIES ONE IF.

01:39:20.821 --> 01:39:26.660
YOU CAN HELP ME WITH THAT.

01:39:26.727 --> 01:39:29.096
I THINK WE JUST GOT A TAKE A

01:39:29.163 --> 01:39:30.864
LOOK AT SOME INNOVATIVE.

01:39:30.931 --> 01:39:32.866
WAYS OF APPROACHING THAT WHETHER

01:39:32.933 --> 01:39:34.702
IT IS THROUGH LICENSING --

01:39:34.768 --> 01:39:36.837
THROUGH OUR MINIS UP MANY OF

01:39:36.904 --> 01:39:37.104
THESE --

01:39:37.171 --> 01:39:40.641
HOTELS ARE CHAINS THERE THEY ARE

01:39:40.708 --> 01:39:42.643
PUBLICLY TRADED --

01:39:42.710 --> 01:39:44.712
THEY HAVE LICENCES TO OPERATE IN

01:39:44.778 --> 01:39:45.412
THE STATE A CALIFORNIA THEY HAVE

01:39:45.479 --> 01:39:46.980
TO MEET CERTAIN HEALTH AND

01:39:47.047 --> 01:39:48.716
SAFETY STANDARDS --

01:39:48.782 --> 01:39:51.018
THIS COULD BE PART OF THE HEALTH

01:39:51.085 --> 01:39:52.686
AND SAFETY.

01:39:52.753 --> 01:39:53.354
I MEAN IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE FOR

01:39:53.420 --> 01:39:54.955
THE WORKERS AND IT'S A HEALTH

01:39:55.022 --> 01:39:56.790
ISSUE AS WELL.

01:39:56.857 --> 01:39:58.792
AND SO MAYBE THROUGH THE IN THE

01:39:58.859 --> 01:40:00.961
FOOD INDUSTRY IN THE HOTEL

01:40:01.028 --> 01:40:02.996
INDUSTRY MAYBE THERE'S OTHER

01:40:03.063 --> 01:40:06.667
WAYS TO APPROACH IT --

01:40:06.734 --> 01:40:07.267
I MEAN IF YOU TRY TO LOOK LIKE

01:40:07.334 --> 01:40:08.702
WITHOUT A CONTRACT.

01:40:08.769 --> 01:40:09.303
IS THERE CERTAINLY ARE THAT WE

01:40:09.370 --> 01:40:10.971
TO PUT ON THERE THAT WERE WERE

01:40:11.038 --> 01:40:12.706
SOMEBODY FEELS THE PAIN TO NOT.

01:40:12.773 --> 01:40:14.608
Q. COMMONSENSE LIES.

01:40:14.675 --> 01:40:16.910
WELL I THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT

01:40:16.977 --> 01:40:18.679
THE REGISTRY BILL DOES IN

01:40:18.746 --> 01:40:19.279
NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT IF IT

01:40:19.346 --> 01:40:21.081
REQUIRES AN EMPLOYER THEY EVERY

01:40:21.148 --> 01:40:22.716
JANITORIAL CONTRACTOR HAS TO

01:40:22.783 --> 01:40:24.818
BASICALLY HAS TO REGISTER.

01:40:24.885 --> 01:40:26.720
AND THEN YOU'RE SUBJECT TO ALL

01:40:26.787 --> 01:40:27.287
OF THESE REQUIREMENTS WHICH

01:40:27.354 --> 01:40:28.922
INCLUDES THIS ADDITIONAL SEXUAL

01:40:28.989 --> 01:40:32.593
HARASSMENT TRAINING AND IF YOU

01:40:32.659 --> 01:40:33.193
DON'T REGISTER OR YOU DON'T

01:40:33.260 --> 01:40:34.661
COMPLETE THE TRAINING OR YOU

01:40:34.728 --> 01:40:35.329
DON'T COMPLETE ANY OF THE OTHER

01:40:35.396 --> 01:40:36.630
REQUIREMENTS.

01:40:36.697 --> 01:40:38.699
THEN YOU WOULD YOU WOULD LOSE

01:40:38.766 --> 01:40:39.366
BASICALLY YOUR LICENSE AND YOUR

01:40:39.433 --> 01:40:40.968
ABILITY SO EVERY TIME YOU HAVE

01:40:41.034 --> 01:40:42.669
TO RE REGISTER YOU HAVE TO

01:40:42.736 --> 01:40:44.638
SUBMIT INFORMATION TO THE STATE.

01:40:44.705 --> 01:40:46.673
SO MAYBE SOMETHING ALONG THE

01:40:46.740 --> 01:40:47.307
LINES OF THAT BUT TAYLOR TO A

01:40:47.374 --> 01:40:48.609
DIFFERENT INDUSTRY THAT'S

01:40:48.675 --> 01:40:50.644
RELATED.

01:40:50.711 --> 01:40:51.245
TO IN OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU

01:40:51.311 --> 01:40:52.980
HAVE BUT I THINK NINETEEN

01:40:53.046 --> 01:40:54.848
SEVENTY EIGHT IS IS IS ONE MODEL

01:40:54.915 --> 01:40:55.382
AND WE TOOK IT FOR A STATE

01:40:55.449 --> 01:40:56.750
CONTRACTORS.

01:40:56.817 --> 01:40:58.852
SUPPORT SO IT'S WE DEFINITELY

01:40:58.919 --> 01:41:00.687
HAD IT -- IN

01:41:00.754 --> 01:41:02.790
LA BEFORE AND I THINK WHERE NOW

01:41:02.856 --> 01:41:03.357
TRYING TO ESTABLISH ONE FOR

01:41:03.424 --> 01:41:05.025
PORTRAIT DRIVERS AS WELL SO.

01:41:05.092 --> 01:41:06.994
MAYBE IT IS A WAY FOR THE FUTURE

01:41:07.060 --> 01:41:08.662
THAT -- I

01:41:08.729 --> 01:41:11.031
JUST WANT I I I I JUST WANT TO

01:41:11.098 --> 01:41:11.665
POINT OUT THAT A LOT OF THESE

01:41:11.732 --> 01:41:12.933
HOTELS ARE OWNED BY PRIVATE

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.902
EQUITY FIRMS THAT ARE.

01:41:14.968 --> 01:41:18.972
LOW'S NNST SEE I HAVE TO SAY

01:41:19.039 --> 01:41:19.640
BEFORE YOU DID IT YOU KNOW THAT

01:41:19.706 --> 01:41:21.141
OUR CALPERS HAS INVESTED IN SO

01:41:21.208 --> 01:41:23.143
THE POWER OF THE DOLLAR GO AHEAD

01:41:23.210 --> 01:41:24.645
MONEY LENNY YOU KNOW THIS FAR

01:41:24.711 --> 01:41:25.312
BETTER THAN I KNOW I YOU YOU HIT

01:41:25.379 --> 01:41:26.947
IT ON ON THE NOSE --

01:41:27.014 --> 01:41:30.818
WE HAVE COMPANIES PRIVATE EQUITY

01:41:30.884 --> 01:41:31.118
COMPANIES.

01:41:31.185 --> 01:41:32.753
THAT ARE BENEFITING FROM OUR

01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:34.721
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

01:41:34.788 --> 01:41:38.725
AND THEY COULD IN ONE FELL SWOOP.

01:41:38.792 --> 01:41:39.393
THEY COULD MAKE A DECISION THAT

01:41:39.460 --> 01:41:42.629
ANY COMPANY THEY OWN.

01:41:42.696 --> 01:41:43.197
AND THAT WE ARE BENEFITING.

01:41:43.263 --> 01:41:44.965
WOULD HAVE WOULD STOP THE

01:41:45.032 --> 01:41:46.867
HARASSMENT PERIOD.

01:41:46.934 --> 01:41:48.869
AND IF THEY DON'T THEN THEY

01:41:48.936 --> 01:41:49.403
DON'T BENEFIT FROM MY TAX

01:41:49.470 --> 01:41:50.771
DOLLARS --

01:41:50.838 --> 01:41:54.808
SO THEY CONTINUE TO GO ALONG IT.

01:41:54.875 --> 01:41:56.877
ENOUGH IT DOESN'T HIT HARD IN

01:41:56.944 --> 01:41:58.846
THE POCKETBOOK THEY ARE NOT

01:41:58.912 --> 01:42:01.048
GOING TO STOP UNLESS THERE IS

01:42:01.114 --> 01:42:04.651
SOMETHING OF EQUAL POWER.

01:42:04.718 --> 01:42:06.687
SO I THINK THAT'S A ANOTHER WAY

01:42:06.753 --> 01:42:08.856
OF HOW THESE PRIVATE EQUITY

01:42:08.922 --> 01:42:09.490
COMPANIES ARE FUNCTIONING WITH

01:42:09.556 --> 01:42:10.657
OUR TAX DOLLARS.

01:42:10.724 --> 01:42:22.703
WE NEED TO BE PUT ON HOLD --

01:42:22.769 --> 01:42:24.805
I WONDERED JUST COMMENT ON KATHY

01:42:24.872 --> 01:42:26.940
I APPRECIATE WHAT THE THE DTV

01:42:27.007 --> 01:42:27.241
ROB FORD.

01:42:27.307 --> 01:42:29.109
AND I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU

01:42:29.176 --> 01:42:30.677
MORE ABOUT ENFORCEMENT POLICY.

01:42:30.744 --> 01:42:32.713
I'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE NOW

01:42:32.779 --> 01:42:34.715
FOR TWO YEARS AND I EXPRESSED MY

01:42:34.781 --> 01:42:36.783
FRUSTRATION IS THAT.

01:42:36.850 --> 01:42:37.351
ARE THE POLICY THAT WE'RE

01:42:37.417 --> 01:42:38.785
PUTTING TOGETHER ARE WE

01:42:38.852 --> 01:42:40.921
IMPLEMENTING IT AS WE WERE

01:42:40.988 --> 01:42:42.689
HOPING ASSEMBLY EMPLOYMENT.

01:42:42.756 --> 01:42:44.758
ARE WE DOING THE OVERSIGHT THAT

01:42:44.825 --> 01:42:45.259
WE NEED TO DO ON IT.

01:42:45.325 --> 01:42:47.094
AND SO I'M TURNING THE TABLES TO

01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:50.731
US POLICIES THAT WE BILL PUT

01:42:50.797 --> 01:42:52.666
TOGETHER WE SHOULD TEST AND

01:42:52.733 --> 01:42:53.267
CHECK AND SEE IF THE WORKING

01:42:53.333 --> 01:42:53.567
CORRECTLY.

01:42:53.634 --> 01:42:55.068
ME THINK OF THINGS SOME SINCE

01:42:55.135 --> 01:42:56.670
NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT DO WE

01:42:56.737 --> 01:42:57.304
NEED TO CHANGE SOME OF THOSE DO

01:42:57.371 --> 01:42:58.939
THEY MEET UP UPDATING --

01:42:59.006 --> 01:43:00.941
THOSE ARE SOME OF MY

01:43:01.008 --> 01:43:02.809
FRUSTRATIONS I HAVEN'T WHEN.

01:43:02.876 --> 01:43:05.078
POLICIES OLD WE DON'T GO BACK IN

01:43:05.145 --> 01:43:06.914
AND IT MIGHT JUST NEEDED REAL

01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:08.782
EASY TO TWEAK THE CHANGES ALL

01:43:08.849 --> 01:43:10.684
THIS VERY EASILY --

01:43:10.751 --> 01:43:12.786
RENDON THE VISION AND I THINK

01:43:12.853 --> 01:43:14.688
SOMETIMES WE GET IN THIS WHOLE

01:43:14.755 --> 01:43:16.723
WORKING AT THE CAPITOL AND WE

01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:17.324
DON'T REALIZE THAT'S WHY I'M

01:43:17.391 --> 01:43:18.825
HERE TODAY IS THAT.

01:43:18.892 --> 01:43:19.493
HEARING A WHOLE NOTHER SIDE THAT

01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:20.827
I HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT I THINK

01:43:20.894 --> 01:43:22.829
WE ALL NEED TO DO THAT.

01:43:22.896 --> 01:43:24.865
UP A PRIOR PRIMARILY IT'S OUR

01:43:24.932 --> 01:43:26.900
RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THE

01:43:26.967 --> 01:43:27.367
POLICIES THAT WE HAVE

01:43:27.434 --> 01:43:27.668
[INAUDIBLE]

01:43:27.734 --> 01:43:28.635
ARE WORKING.

01:43:28.702 --> 01:43:31.204
AND MAKING SURE THE FOLLOW UP

01:43:31.271 --> 01:43:32.839
WITH THOSE THAT AGENCIES ARE

01:43:32.906 --> 01:43:34.942
THEY DOING THEIR JOB BECAUSE I

01:43:35.008 --> 01:43:36.710
HAD A TERRIBLE SITUATION THAT

01:43:36.777 --> 01:43:38.912
I'M WORKING ON YOU KNOW THE BILL

01:43:38.979 --> 01:43:39.079
WAS.

01:43:39.146 --> 01:43:40.747
THE HEALTH CARE DIVISION AND WE

01:43:40.814 --> 01:43:42.683
FOUND OUT DATA WAS GOING TO

01:43:42.749 --> 01:43:44.751
MANAGE HEALTH CARE.

01:43:44.818 --> 01:43:45.085
AND IT'S SAD.

01:43:45.152 --> 01:43:47.054
AND IT HAS DONE ABSOLUTELY

01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:48.655
NOTHING.

01:43:48.722 --> 01:43:50.891
AND SO I THINK WE ALL SHOULD

01:43:50.958 --> 01:43:51.491
PROBABLY LOOK AT SOME OF THE

01:43:51.558 --> 01:43:53.060
POLICIES WERE INTERESTED IN AND

01:43:53.126 --> 01:43:55.128
SEEING ISN'T ALREADY THERE AND

01:43:55.195 --> 01:43:56.697
HOW CAN WE MAKE THAT BETTER OR

01:43:56.763 --> 01:43:58.665
ELSE WHAT POLICIES WE DO DESIGN.

01:43:58.732 --> 01:44:01.001
ARE PUT TOGETHER IS A WE FOLLOW

01:44:01.068 --> 01:44:02.636
THROUGH I MEAN FROM YOU WERE

01:44:02.703 --> 01:44:03.103
LUCKY WE'RE ALL HERE.

01:44:03.170 --> 01:44:04.705
FOR POTENTIALLY TWELVE YEARS AND

01:44:04.771 --> 01:44:06.940
YOU CAN DO APOLLO THE GOOD

01:44:07.007 --> 01:44:08.842
POLICY IN THAT WHERE A PERIOD OF

01:44:08.909 --> 01:44:10.644
TIME WE CAN IMPLEMENT THAT

01:44:10.711 --> 01:44:11.244
POLICY WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT

01:44:11.311 --> 01:44:12.679
THAT.

01:44:12.746 --> 01:44:13.246
IF IT NEEDS AMENDMENTS AND

01:44:13.313 --> 01:44:16.683
CHANGES WE CAN DO THAT SO I I I

01:44:16.750 --> 01:44:17.384
SAY TO ALL OF US LET'S MAKE SURE

01:44:17.451 --> 01:44:18.986
THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING.

01:44:19.052 --> 01:44:20.887
IS REALLY WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED

01:44:20.954 --> 01:44:22.656
TO DO AND IF SOMETHING IN

01:44:22.723 --> 01:44:23.223
NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT MIGHT

01:44:23.290 --> 01:44:23.824
NEED TO BE CHANGED [INAUDIBLE]

01:44:23.890 --> 01:44:24.691
UPDATED SO.

01:44:24.758 --> 01:44:27.027
I APPRECIATE THANK YOU VERY MUCH

01:44:27.094 --> 01:44:34.701
FOR YOUR DISSIPATION ALBEIT.

01:44:34.768 --> 01:44:35.302
YEAH THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY

01:44:35.369 --> 01:44:36.903
MUCH THIS WAS --

01:44:36.970 --> 01:44:38.672
EXTREMELY ENLIGHTENING I'VE BEEN

01:44:38.739 --> 01:44:39.339
IN THE LEGISLATURE FOR JUST OVER

01:44:39.406 --> 01:44:40.974
A MONTH NOW AND THIS IS NOT AN

01:44:41.041 --> 01:44:41.642
AREA WHERE I HAVE TO TAKE EXPERT.

01:44:41.708 --> 01:44:44.745
THIS WAS A VERY VERY VERY EYE

01:44:44.811 --> 01:44:45.045
OPENING --

01:44:45.112 --> 01:44:47.114
ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE MON REALLY I

01:44:47.180 --> 01:44:48.915
ASK IS AT THE HEART OF MY

01:44:48.982 --> 01:44:49.416
QUESTION WHICH WAS ABOUT

01:44:49.483 --> 01:44:50.717
ENFORCEMENT IN IN FRANKLY

01:44:50.784 --> 01:44:51.351
SHOCKING TO ME THAT THERE'S ONLY

01:44:51.418 --> 01:44:52.619
A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.

01:44:52.686 --> 01:44:54.855
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT OUR

01:44:54.921 --> 01:44:55.422
STATE GOVERNMENT WOULD BE

01:44:55.489 --> 01:44:58.692
ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN ENFORCING --

01:44:58.759 --> 01:44:59.459
I ALSO WANTED TO SAY MARINO LAYA --

01:44:59.526 --> 01:45:01.128
I WAS STRUCK BY YOUR COMMENTS

01:45:01.194 --> 01:45:02.763
BECAUSE I WAS TRYING MY

01:45:02.829 --> 01:45:03.196
COLLEAGUE HERE --

01:45:03.263 --> 01:45:04.965
I WAS TAKING NOTES REFLECTING ON

01:45:05.032 --> 01:45:06.600
WHAT SOME OF THE WOMEN IN OUR

01:45:06.667 --> 01:45:08.602
FIRST PANELIST SAID IN THE FIRST

01:45:08.669 --> 01:45:09.169
THING I WROTE DOWN WAS POWER

01:45:09.236 --> 01:45:09.469
IMBALANCE.

01:45:09.536 --> 01:45:10.937
IT'S SAY TO ME THE REAL QUESTION

01:45:11.004 --> 01:45:11.538
IS HOW DO WE SHIFT THAT POWER

01:45:11.605 --> 01:45:13.006
BALANCE AND WHAT CAN WE DO S.

01:45:13.073 --> 01:45:14.975
LEGISLATORS WHETHER THROUGH ITS.

01:45:15.042 --> 01:45:15.642
OUR INFLUENCE ALL OVER THE LEGAL

01:45:15.709 --> 01:45:18.645
PROP.

01:45:18.712 --> 01:45:20.747
OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT I DO A

01:45:20.814 --> 01:45:22.749
CHEF THAT PARAMOUNT'S AYE TWO

01:45:22.816 --> 01:45:23.083
QUESTIONS --

01:45:23.150 --> 01:45:24.885
AND I APOLOGIZE ONE OF THEM MAY

01:45:24.951 --> 01:45:26.753
BE VERY DOWN THIS IS AN AREA I

01:45:26.820 --> 01:45:27.354
DON'T HAVE A LOT OF EXPERTISE

01:45:27.421 --> 01:45:28.922
AND ONE IS --

01:45:28.989 --> 01:45:30.824
JUST THINKING ABOUT THE IDEA OF

01:45:30.891 --> 01:45:32.626
REPEAT OFFENDERS --

01:45:32.693 --> 01:45:33.293
AYE I'M ASSUMING THAT IT'S TRUE

01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:34.961
THAT THERE A LOT OF INDIVIDUAL

01:45:35.028 --> 01:45:36.630
REPEAT OFFENDERS FOR US THE

01:45:36.697 --> 01:45:37.297
ABOUT THAT ALSO IN THE CORPORATE

01:45:37.364 --> 01:45:38.632
SENSE AND WONDERING IF WE HAVE

01:45:38.699 --> 01:45:39.366
ANY DATA ON THAT I KNOW A LOT OF

01:45:39.433 --> 01:45:40.801
THIS MAY BE DIFFICULT TO FIND.

01:45:40.867 --> 01:45:42.836
BUT PERHAPS THERE'S ONE WAY FOR

01:45:42.903 --> 01:45:44.771
THE GOVERNMENT TO BE INVOLVED.

01:45:44.838 --> 01:45:45.305
A TARGET BAD ACTORS WHERE

01:45:45.372 --> 01:45:46.940
THERE'S REPEAT OFFENDERS IN THE

01:45:47.007 --> 01:45:48.642
CORPORATE SENSE MAYBE YOU HAVE

01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:49.209
PARTICULAR CORPORATIONS ARE

01:45:49.276 --> 01:45:50.877
BUSINESSES WE CERTAINLY

01:45:50.944 --> 01:45:52.713
UNDERSTAND INDUSTRIES BUT

01:45:52.779 --> 01:45:53.346
CORPORATIONS ARE BUSINESSES THAT

01:45:53.413 --> 01:45:54.681
ARE BAD ACTORS.

01:45:54.748 --> 01:45:56.750
THAT YOU KNOW WE CAN LOOK OKAY

01:45:56.817 --> 01:45:57.350
THERE HAS BEEN A SERIES OF

01:45:57.417 --> 01:45:58.952
OFFENSES THERE'S A THAT A

01:45:59.019 --> 01:45:59.553
CULTURE HERE THAT NEEDS TO

01:45:59.619 --> 01:46:00.921
CHANGE AND THERE'S AN

01:46:00.987 --> 01:46:01.521
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE TO

01:46:01.588 --> 01:46:03.123
STEP AND I'M IN THE SECOND WAS

01:46:03.190 --> 01:46:05.092
JUST A MORE NARROW POINT --

01:46:05.158 --> 01:46:06.827
THINKING ABOUT WHAT ASSEMBLY

01:46:06.893 --> 01:46:08.729
MEMBER SANTIAGO HAD SAID --

01:46:08.795 --> 01:46:10.764
MAYBE WE OUGHT TO THINK ABOUT

01:46:10.831 --> 01:46:11.331
REQUIRED TO MEET WE DO THIS

01:46:11.398 --> 01:46:12.666
ALREADY --

01:46:12.733 --> 01:46:13.233
BUSINESSES THAT OPERATE IN

01:46:13.300 --> 01:46:14.835
CALIFORNIA PUT IN THEIR

01:46:14.901 --> 01:46:16.737
CORPORATE FILINGS THE WAY IN

01:46:16.803 --> 01:46:18.672
WHICH THEY COMPLY WITH --

01:46:18.739 --> 01:46:20.741
SEXUAL HARASSMENT --

01:46:20.807 --> 01:46:24.778
AND AND LAWS OF WHAT THEIR

01:46:24.845 --> 01:46:25.412
POLICIES ARE WHAT THEY'RE DOING

01:46:25.479 --> 01:46:26.947
TO PREVENT SEXUAL RATS BECAUSE

01:46:27.013 --> 01:46:28.749
OBVIOUSLY ANYTHING THAT THEY PUT

01:46:28.815 --> 01:46:29.182
IN THOSE FILINGS --

01:46:29.249 --> 01:46:31.051
YOU TO PUT THEM AT JEOPARDY AND

01:46:31.118 --> 01:46:32.686
THAT WHAT WILL HOLD THEM TO TO

01:46:32.753 --> 01:46:34.888
WHAT THEIR SANK SO THAT WAS

01:46:34.955 --> 01:46:36.623
ANOTHER IDEA.

01:46:36.690 --> 01:46:38.692
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA I KNOW THAT

01:46:38.759 --> 01:46:39.326
THERE'S BEEN SOME MOVEMENT AT

01:46:39.392 --> 01:46:42.596
THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO REQUIRE --

01:46:42.662 --> 01:46:44.765
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO I BELIEVE IF

01:46:44.831 --> 01:46:46.600
YOU'RE A PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANY

01:46:46.666 --> 01:46:47.200
REPORTING LAWSUITS THAT THE

01:46:47.267 --> 01:46:48.935
CORPORATION IS FACING.

01:46:49.002 --> 01:46:51.071
AND SO IF THERE ARE SEXUAL

01:46:51.138 --> 01:46:52.873
HARASSMENT LAWSUITS EVEN IN

01:46:52.939 --> 01:46:54.674
PROCESS NOT NECESSARILY --

01:46:54.741 --> 01:46:56.877
COMPLETED UMPIRE SEXUAL

01:46:56.943 --> 01:46:58.845
DISCRIMINATION LAWSUITS --

01:46:58.912 --> 01:47:02.616
THE WHOLE FOX NEWS OPERATION

01:47:02.682 --> 01:47:04.651
ENDED UP WITH THE IT WAS A NIGHT.

01:47:04.718 --> 01:47:06.620
NINETY MILLION IT MIGHT BE MORE --

01:47:06.686 --> 01:47:08.688
PENALTY --

01:47:08.755 --> 01:47:10.724
BECAUSE THEY HAD DEFRAUDED THEIR

01:47:10.791 --> 01:47:12.859
INVESTORS BY NOT REVEALING THE

01:47:12.926 --> 01:47:14.961
EXTENT OF THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT

01:47:15.028 --> 01:47:16.863
AND ASSAULT PROBLEMS --

01:47:16.930 --> 01:47:18.732
IN THAT NEWS ORGANIZATION THAT

01:47:18.799 --> 01:47:21.001
COST THEM HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS

01:47:21.067 --> 01:47:22.836
OF DOLLARS IN PAYOUTS AND BY NOT

01:47:22.903 --> 01:47:24.871
REVEALING THAT YOU WERE

01:47:24.938 --> 01:47:26.673
DEFRAUDING YOUR INVESTORS.

01:47:26.740 --> 01:47:28.809
SO THERE MAY BE A ROLE FOR

01:47:28.875 --> 01:47:29.142
CALIFORNIA --

01:47:29.209 --> 01:47:31.111
TO PLAY IN THAT FOR ANY PUBLICLY

01:47:31.178 --> 01:47:32.879
