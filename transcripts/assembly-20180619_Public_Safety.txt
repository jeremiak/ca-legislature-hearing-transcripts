WELCOME TO ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC SAFETY WILL BEGIN AS A SUBCOMMITTEE. OF THE FOLLOWING ITEMS HAVE BEEN PULLED BY THE AUTHORS -- ITEM NUMBER TWO SB EIGHT TO FIVE BELT STATE PRISONS PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM AN ITEM NUMBER FOURTEEN S. B. TWELVE SIXTY SIX PORTANTINO BURGLARY WE HAVE. WE'RE READY BEGAN WE BEGIN THE SUBCOMMITTEE WE HAVE ONE AUTHORED READY TO GO AS USUAL AT NINE O'CLOCK PROMPTLY ON TIME. AND THAT SIZE SENATOR HILL S. B.. ELEVEN EIGHTY SIX ITEM NUMBER TEN YOU MAY BEGIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS S. B. ELEVEN EIGHTY SIX INSURANCE THAT STATE LAW KEEPS UP WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT'S RAPID ADOPTION OF SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGIES. WITH THE AMENDMENTS MADE IN SENATE APPROPRIATIONS S. B. ELEVEN EIGHTY SIX APPLIES THE EXACT SAME POLICY IN PLACE. FOR LICENSE PLATE READERS AND CELLPHONE INTERCEPTED VICES TO ALL SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY USED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE LICENSE PLATE READER INSULT CELL PHONE INTERCEPTS DEVICE LEGISLATION PASSED OFF OF OUR FLOOR THIS THIS FOUR ACTUALLY WITH BROAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. IF THE POLICE WANT TO SEARCH YOUR PHONE YOUR CAR OR YOUR HOUSE THEY HAVE TO GET A WARRANT BUT MANY AGENCIES HAVE TECHNOLOGY THAT CONTRACT WHERE YOU GO WHO YOU TALK. TO AND WHAT YOU SAY IN PUBLIC PLACES WITHOUT ANY SAFEGUARDS OVER ONE HUNDRED LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN THE STATE ARE THOUGHT TO USE SOME TYPE OF SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY. IN MANY DEPLOY MULTIPLE KINDS INCLUDING FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY AND SOFTWARE THAT CAN MONITOR SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITES. THIS MEANS SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY WILL BE SUBJECT TO PUBLIC DISCLOSURE AND LOCAL LEGISLATIVE REVIEW. THE BILL PROVIDES AN EXIGENCY COMPS DANCE PROVISION TO LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ALLOW THEM TO USE UNAPPROVED SURVEILLANCE DEVICES IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS LAW ENFORCEMENT GROUPS WILL ARGUE THAT CREATING TRANSPARENCY PROVIDES OF SURVEILLANCE ROADMAP TO CRIMINALS. THIS IS NOT THE CASE THE MERE KNOWLEDGE OF A POLICE TACTIC DOES NOT RENDER IT USELESS THERE ARE ALREADY LAWS MANDATING THE DISCLOSURE OF WIRE TAPS. AND LICENSE PLATE READERS IN BOTH TECHNOLOGIES STILL HELP CATCH CRIMINALS SOME CONCERNS MAY ALSO BE EXPRESSED BY THE BREADTH OF SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGIES COVERED BY THIS BILL. SB ELEVEN EIGHTY SIX RECOGNIZES THE WIDE AND EVER CHANGING ARRAY OF STUFF RIGHT SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGIES AT THE DISPOSAL OF LAW ENFORCEMENT NOW AND IN THE FUTURE. THE GOAL IS TO BE SPECIFIC ENOUGH TO CAPTURE THE APPROPRIATE SURVEILLANCE DEVICES BUT NOT OVERLY PRESCRIPTIVE SURE THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO RUN A BILL EACH YEAR. AND EACH TIME A NEW TECHNOLOGIES INVENTED. INCLUSION OF LIKE TO MAKE ONE THING VERY BILL DOES NOT PROHIBIT LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM USING SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY TO FIGHT CRIME IT SIMPLY. TAKES EXISTING STANDARDS FOR LICENSE PLATE READERS AND CELLPHONE INTERCEPT DEVICES AND APPLIES THEM TO ALL SURVEILLANCE DEVICES. I SUPPORT USING TECHNOLOGY TO INCREASE PUBLIC SAFETY BUT WE NEED TO SAFEGUARD BASIC CIVIL LIBERTIES FROM POTENTIAL ABUSES. I WILL RESPECTFULLY ASK DR OF MEMBERS AND I'VE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU YOU HAVE WITNESSES. MORE IN THE NATURE MEMBERS KEVIN BIG AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF CALIFORNIA WE BELIEVE THAT LOCAL CONTROL THROUGH LOCAL PUBLIC [inaudible] SCHOOLS IS THE BEST WAY TO ASSURE THE LOCAL VALUES AND PRIORITIES ARE REFLECTED IN THESE LOCAL PUBLIC SAFETY DECISIONS. AS SENATOR HILL INDICATED THIS POWERFUL NEW TECHNOLOGIES MAY BE GOOD AND USEFUL FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THEY ARE CERTAINLY APPROPRIATE MANY CASES. AND BUT WE SHOULD ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT THEY HAVE POTENTIAL RISKS FOR INTRUSION INTO GUN. PERSONAL PRIVACY OF INNOCENT PEOPLE AND CAN DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. WE'VE ALSO SEEN THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS HAD AND ACCESS TO DATABASES WRONG FROM LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT SUCH AS THE LICENSE PLATE READER -- THAT IS USED TO TRACK PEOPLE'S MOVEMENTS AND THE IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN USING THAT. SUBSCRIBING TO THAT DATABASE AND YET -- ACCORDING TO PUBLISHED REPORTS AND YET WHEN THE ACLU HAS ASKED FOR RECORDS. REGARDING -- THAT -- I PRACTICE ON THAT WE'VE BEEN FORCED TO SUE ICE FOUND FOR THEIR REFUSAL TO TURN OVER INFORMATION ON THAT PROGRAM. SO WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL IS ESSENTIAL FOR TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY PUBLIC TRUST. VERY SIMILAR TO A BILL ON THAT THIS COMMITTEE HEARD AND TO BY MR GLORIA A. B. THIRTY ONE THIRTY ONE WHICH THE COMMITTEE PASSED A FEW WEEKS AGO. REGARDING THE ACQUISITION USE OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT ALSO VERY SIMILAR TO BUILD THE COMMITTEE PASSED LAST YEAR SIN BY SENATOR HILL SP TWENTY ONE EXCEPT THIS BILL WAS EVEN NEAR WHERE -- AND WE WOULD ASK FOR YOUR AYE SPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. THE MORNING GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS WHO SHALL MUCH LOWER ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION.

AS WELL AS AMENDMENTS BASED ON FUTURE TECHNOLOGY ACQUISITION AND TO THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS I AM. SHERIFFS ARE AYE INDEPENDENT ELECTED OFFICIALS AND RESPECTFULLY I'M SHOULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN DATA APPROVAL OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS BEFORE DETERMINING HOW TO BEST CARRY OUT THEIR DUTY TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC SAFETY. AND IN FACT BY LIMITING THE ABILITY OF THE SHERIFF TO ACQUIRE SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY WITHOUT THE PRIOR CONSIDERATION OF THAT POLICY BY THE BOARD S. B. ELEVEN EIGHTY SIX LIKELY VIOLATES THE GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION. TWENTY FIVE THREE OH THREE WHICH STATES IN RELEVANT PART THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SHALL NOT OBSTRUCT INVESTIGATIVE FUNCTION OF THE SHERIFF OF THE COUNTY.

SO I'VE DISCUSSES WITH THE GOOD SENATOR -- SO I VOTED FOR AND EVEN HAD BILLS OUT ASKING FOR MORE TRANSPARENCY. MY CONCERN WITH THIS IS THAT IT IS JUST IT'S NOT DEFINING IN A JUST MUCH TO OPEN -- I WAS IN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY IN FOR OVER TEN YEARS AND WE ALWAYS WANT TO PROTECT SOURCES AND METHODS. AND WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING IS COMPLETELY OPEN LIKE THIS WHERE? WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TECHNOLOGY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. IT COULD BE THROUGH THIS DISCLOSURE. THAT YOU ARE GIVING-- NOTICE TO THE MORE SOPHISTICATED MEMBERS OF THE CRIMINAL COMMUNITY HOW TO AVOID -- ENFORCEMENT HOW TO AVOID DETECTION -- IF THE BILL WHERE MORE NARROW I THINK I COULD -- IF IT DISCUSSED PARTICULAR TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY AND I VOTED. FOR LIMITING -- ARE AT LEAST DISCLOSING THINGS LIKE. CAMBER READER AT LICENSE PLATE READERS WITH CAMERAS. DRONES AT CETERA BUT TO BE JUST COMPLETELY OPEN LIKE THIS I DON'T FEEL I CAN SUPPORT THE BILL AT THIS TIME. UP YOU CAN -- ANSWER ME IN YOUR CLOSE THANK YOU. OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OKAY. MR HILL WITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU TO TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK FOR A FIRST QUESTION AND FOR OUR CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE WE'VE HAD -- YOU KNOW IS A LOOK AT THE THE LEGISLATION AND THE HISTORY OVER -- SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY WHEN WE STARTED WITH LICENSE PLATE READERS AND THEN WE THE NEXT YEAR WE ALL OF SUDDEN DISCOVERED THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAD BEEN USING THE CELLULAR INTERCEPTED VICES IN LOCATIONS THAT UP. AND IN A MANNER THAT -- WASBASICALLY FOR A FREE FOR ALL CIRCUMSTANCE ROUTE WITH NO CONTROLS OVER IT AND EVEN ONE CITY WAS USING IT DIDN'T FLY THAT A CHALLENGE THAT WE'RE FACED WITH IS THAT THE TECHNOLOGY IS IS DEVELOPING SO RAPIDLY THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO CONTINUOUSLY CONTINUALLY. WAIT UNTIL WE GET SITE OF UNDERSTAND HER SHE OR SOMEONE EXPOSES A PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY -- AND THEN WE HAVE TO DO LEGISLATION THIS COVERS ALL OF THE LEGISLATION OR ALL OF THAT. ANY NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT IS PRESENTED AND THAT NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT'S PRESENTED -- WHAT WE'VE SEEN HISTORICALLY IS IT DOESN'T? PROJECT PRECLUDE LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM CATCHING THE BAD GUYS ARE CRIMINALS JUST FOR THE FACT OF HAVING IT OR THAT THE PUBLIC KNOWS IT THEY KNOW WE DO WIRETAPS TODAY. THEY STILL TALK ON THE PHONE AND SAY THE SAME THINGS THAT THEY SHOULDN'T THEY KNOW WE HAVE LICENSE PLATE READERS IT PEOPLE STILL STEAL CARS. AND DRIVE AROUND IN THOSE CARS AND GET PICKED UP FROM THEM -- THIS IS COMMON TECHNOLOGY THAT -- FROM ONE JURISDICTION TO THE NEXT ISN'T SPECIFIC TO THAT JURISDICTION FROM UP PERSPECTIVE OF A OF A CRIMINAL AND THEY KNOW THAT THE TECHNOLOGY IS AVAILABLE THEY RECOGNIZE THAT IN THEY USE THAT TECHNIQUE THAT THE LAW ENFORCEMENT USES THAT TECHNOLOGY. I BELIEVE WITHOUT ANY RESTRICTION TODAY AND AND IT'S VERY SUCCESSFUL AND WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO ALLOW THEM TO DO THAT WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE. AND THAT'S THAT BUT TO ME THE MOST IMPORTANT PART THAT THE PUBLIC BODY THE ELECTED BODY THE CIVILIAN BODY MAKES THOSE DECISIONS AND UNDERSTANDS IN A PUBLIC FORUM WHAT TYPE OF EQUIPMENT IS BEING USED THEIR EFFECT WE EFFORT I'VE OF MEMBERS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- AT AND I RESPECT -- THAT THE QUESTION OF MISTER CORCORAN AND I AND AND I'M. WANNA MOVE THIS OUT SO WE CAN KEEP THIS GOING I THINK -- TRANSPARENCY IS REALLY IMPORTANT -- IF YOU CAN WORK WITH. THE COURT HOPEFULLY THAT THIS BILL GETS OUT. TO TO TO ADDRESS HIS CLAIM. ARM BUT I DID WANT TO MENTION KIND OF TWO THINGS OF BECAUSE OF HER JUST HAVE HEARD JUST A SECOND TIME. ON THIS QUESTION. OF AUTHORITY. OF A LEGISLATIVE BODY OVER -- LAFORTUNE. BOB NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE THE RIGHT. TO DO THAT IS OUR FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY -- SHERIFF COULD NOT FUND THEM SELVES THIS YET NEARLY DONE BY THE LEGISLATIVE BODY WE DO THAT WITH CHP. DO TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE AND WE DO THAT ON A LOCAL LEVEL BOAST THAT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND THE AND THE CITY LEVEL. AND IN FACT -- DIFFICULT DEPARTMENTS CAN'T BE FUNDED UNLESS THEY GET APPROVAL FROM CITY COUNCIL NOT FROM THE MAYOR. NOT FROM THE SHERIFF NOTHING CONTROL ENOUGH A TREASURE BUT FROM. THE LEGISLATIVE BODY WOULD THAT BE COUNTY BOARD SUPERVISORS ARE CITY COUNCIL SO THAT'S WE NEED A LY THAT. TO THE SIDE. ON TO WHEN IT COMES. TO HOW LAW ENFORCEMENT OPERATES -- WE DON'T WANT TO GET INTO DEMAND. A NEW SHOW HOW LAW ENFORCEMENT OPERATES A DIRT AS MR PARK SAID. THERE'S SOMETHING SAID THE PUBLIC PROBABLY SHOULD KNOW ORDER [inaudible] HOWEVER. THERE BEEN TIMES WHERE TECHNIQUE. THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS ADVOCATED FOR FOR SOMETIME CONTINUE TO DO IT DO IT HAVE RESULTED. IN SOME ADVERSE. VERY EFFECTIVE AT KILLING MOSTLY AFRICAN AMERICAN MALES. BUT IT WASN'T. ULTIMATELY WE STOPPED THAT IF WE THE LEGISLATIVE BODY HAD NOT INTERVENED. THE MAYORS AND THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH HAD NOT INTERVENED. THAT. TECHNIQUE POLICY WILL PROBABLY BE IN EFFECT TO NOW SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT HAVE SOME TYPE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT. ON HOW LAW ENFORCEMENT OPERATES ESPECIALLY FOR GOES WRONG. IF THE PARTICULAR TECHNIQUES ENDS UP WHERE -- WE HAVE THE UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT AWARE ON AN OFFICER SHOOTS ANON ARMED PERSON IN THE BACK. THAT ITEM WE CAN LOOK AT THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES OF THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SEE WHERE THERE'S A PROBLEM AND SO THAT WE CAN CORRECT THAT OTHERWISE. WHAT WILL WE HAD WE WOULD HAVE ANYTHING AND SO THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT HAVE [inaudible] NAM TRANSPARENCY. SO THAT WE KNOW AND HAVE TRUST IN LAW ENFORCEMENT IT DID VALLEY DOING THE RIGHT THING BUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS BASED. ON ON ON THE ABILITY TO GET THE JOB DONE KEEP LAW ENFORCEMENT SAFE. BUT ALSO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S DEBT THAT WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING TO DO IN THE MORAL THING. AND WITH THAT I'M. URGING THAT WE MOVED JUST THROUGH. I DO BELIEVE MISTER QUIRK HAS SOME VALID ISSUES I HOPE. HE ALLOWS YOU TO GET THROUGH TODAY SO THAT WE CAN WORK THROUGH THAT I THAT I DON'T LET ANYONE. TALK AFTER ME AND I'M LIKE SHUT DOWN SOME. PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE. INSIDE. THIS ONE I JUST HOPE THAT WE CAN MOVE DECIDED HERE TODAY AND THAT YOU WOULD WORK THANK YOU -- IT'S THERE A MOTION. IS THERE A SECOND [inaudible] CALDERON. ON S. B. ELEVEN EIGHTY SIX THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER AYE JONES SAWYER AYE LACKEY. LACKEY NO CARILLO. CARILLO AYE KAMLAGER-DOVE. KAMLAGER-DOVE I KILEY QUIRK. IN LIEU OF THE REQUEST OF THE CHAIR I WILL VOTE TO SEND THIS OUT TODAY. HOWEVER I RESERVE MY VOTE ON THE FLOOR AND BEGAN MIGHT MY PROBLEM IS JUST THAT THIS IS SO OPEN ENDED AND I'M WORRIED ABOUT SOURCES AND METHODS WILL DISCUSS IT LATER WELL THANK YOU PARK I SANTIAGO. THANK YOU THAT MEASURE PASSES AND THEY COULDN'T CARE THANK YOU MEMBERSHIP IN. AND PLEASE WORK WITH MISTER QUIRK I I WILL IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE RAIMES WORK WITH MISTER QUIRK. SO I SEE FOUR EMPTY CHAIRS SO I'M LOOKING. FOR MISTER BRADFORD WHO SIGNED IN MISTER WILK AND WIENER. BRADFORD WELCOME WIENER AND I HAVEN'T HAD ANY OTHER SCIENCE SO SIGNAL HAVE A VERY SHORT. PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE MEETING EXTENSIVE [inaudible] YEAH THAT [inaudible] TROYER. HELLO MISTER BRADFORD YOU MAY. TAKE YOUR SEAT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY YOU COULD BEGIN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT S. B. TWELVE SEVENTY NINE WHICH SIMPLY WILL HOLD. CLARIFY CALIFORNIA'S COMPLEX LAWS AS A RICH AND RESTORE GREATER PROPORTIONALITY AND ARE. A JUSTICE SYSTEM. WHAT ARE PAST EFFORTS ON THE WAR ON DRUGS AND ARE TOUGH? ON CRIME MENTALITY FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE NATION AND STATE. IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVASTATING THEN TARGET A TIRE COMMUNITIES PART PRIMARILY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AN OVERCROWDED OUR PRISON SYSTEM -- BEYOND -- HUMAN. COMPREHENSION. AND MUCH IS IS BEING CAUSED BY ARE VERY COMPLEX AND ARCHAIC SENTENCING LAWS -- WE HAVE SOME OF THE MOST CONFUSING SENTENCING LAWS IN THE NATION EVEN SO THAT. ALL LAWYERS AND JUDGES COSTUMES STATE THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. THIS BILL WOULD -- NOT SCRIPT AND I MEAN INCLUDES BUT NOT LIMITED TO BASED TERMS PRINCIPLE TERM SUBORDINATE TERMS AGGREGATED TERMS ALTERNATIVE SENTENCING SCHEMES CONCURRENT SENTENCING. THE TERMINATE AND TURN INDETERMINATE SENTENCING AND OF COURSE HUNDREDS OF SENTENCE ENHANCEMENTS WHICH ADD YEARS TO OUR RADIO HARSH AND LONG PRISON TERM. WALKED AMEND THE GOVERNOR IN OUR STATE EFFORTS TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF CRIMES THAT WE NOW ENACT THE INTRICATE WEB OF SENTENCING LAWS. AS I STATE IT CONFUSES JUDGES AND LAWYERS TO ADD TO THE PROBLEM OF COMPLEXITY IT'S UNCERTAIN IF WHAT THE SENTENCES SERVE -- ADS ARE INTENDED FUNCTION TO DIG TO YOUR CRIME IF YOU WERE TO LOOK AT THE STATISTICS WOULD OFF. EASILY UP TO SAY THAT THEY DON'T ARE CRIME -- BASED ON SOME FOLKS HAVE INCREASED OVER THE NUMBER OF THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS SO IT CLEARLY APPROVES AT THESE LONG SENTENCES -- SENTENCING AYE TERMS HAVE NOT DISSUADE OR DISCOURAGE FOLKS FROM ARE COMMITTING CRIME UNTIL WE CAN PROVE INCARCERATION WORKS THERE'S NO REASON WHY WE SHOULD DOLE OUT EXTREME SENTENCES FOR ALL CASES IN WHICH SENTENCE ENHANCES MAYBE LONGER. THAN THE UNDERLYING FELONY SENTENCE THE STOP A POLICIES DO NOT IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY INSTEAD CONTRIBUTOR GENERATIONAL SICK CYCLE OF CRIMES AND VIOLENCE AMONGST FAMILIES ENTIRE COMMUNITIES. S. B. TWELVE SEVENTY NINE WILL HELP SAVE ONE IS CONVOLUTED SENTENCE LAWS IMPROVE IMPROVE. THE BALANCE BETWEEN ENHANCEMENTS AND UNDERLYING FELONIES BY SIMPLY ENSURING THAT A FULL TERM OF IMPRISONED DOES NOT EXCEED TWICE THE NUMBER OF YEARS OF THAT BASE TERM. WITH ME TODAY IS EXPERT STEVE RIES. PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROFESSOR OF EVIDENCE AT MODERATE COLLEGE WHO LAW INFORMER ATTORNEY OF MONTEREY COUNTY PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE AND ALSO CHUCK DENTON ARE A LECTURE AT UC BERKELEY AN ATTORNEY WITH ALAMEDA COUNTY. PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE AND WITH THAT -- HOMES CHAIR MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. FIVE MINUTES TOTAL THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I AM STEVEN RACE I'M ATTORNEY IN PRIVATE PRACTICE NOW I'VE BEEN PRACTICING COULD THE DEFENSE BOSSES. NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE AND I'M ALSO WAS PARENTS ABOUT A CENTER BRADFORD SAID CURRENTLY PRESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE -- AT THIS BILL. TWELVE SEVENTY NINE REALLY SEEKS TO BRING SOME COMMON SENSE AND A CERTAIN. SIMPLICITY TO SENTENCING LAW IN CALIFORNIA. AS IT CURRENTLY EXISTS THE CALIFORNIA SENTENCING LAW IS A MAZE OF CODE. SECTIONS WITH WIDE RANGING BASED TERMS PRINCIPLE TERM SUBORDINATE TERMS AND MULTIPLE ENHANCEMENTS. SOME OF WHICH CAN BE IMPOSED IN SOME SITUATIONS BUT NOT IN OTHER SITUATIONS -- THERE ARE. NUMEROUS BOOKS WRITTEN ON SENTENCING LAW IN CALIFORNIA. THAT RUN HUNDREDS OF PAGES THERE ARE ALL DAY SEMINARS SOMETIMES MORE THAN ONE DAY SEMINARS THAT ARE PROVIDED TO JUDGES LAWYERS PROBATION OFFICERS -- ABOUT HOW DO SENTENCING CORRECTLY IN THE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND FOR THOSE OF US WHO -- AS SPEND SOME OF OUR TIME READING APPELLATE DECISIONS -- WE SEE FREQUENTLY CASES BEING SENT BACK TO THE TRIAL COURT TO RE SENTENCE ARE DEFENDANTS ARE BECAUSE THERE WAS AN ERROR POT. NO INTENT NO BAD FAITH JUST AN ERROR IN CALCULATING THE DEFENDANT'S SONS. THOSE RETURNS BECAUSE OF SENTENCING COMPLICATIONS AND ERRORS COST THE STATE UP. I'M CREDIBLE AMOUNT OF MONEY HAVE THOSE CASES SET BACK AND RE DONE -- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS BILL HAS -- SIGNIFICANT EXCEPTIONS TO THE DOUBLE BASS TERM LIMIT. THEIR SPELLED OUT. IN THE STATUTE. AND WHAT IS NOT COVERED UNDER THIS LIMITATION ON DOUBLE BASS TERM. ARE SOME OF THE MORE -- SIGNIFICANT OR SERIOUS CRIMES GANG CRIMES HUMAN SEX TRAFFICKING. AGGRAVATED SEXUAL ASSAULT UPON -- A CHILD HA HABITUAL CRIMINAL -- ENHANCEMENTS FELONY STRIKE ENHANCEMENTS SEX CRIMES WITH A CHILD WITH HIS A PRIOR CONVICTION FOR SEX CRIME -- RAPE -- CASES WHERE THERE IS EITHER A SINGLE VICTIM WITH COST% MULTIPLE -- I TAX OR MULTIPLE VICTIMS -- WITH MULTIPLE ATTACKS IN THE FIRST SCENARIO THE COURT -- MAY IMPOSE WHAT. LAWYERS CALL A FULL BOAT CONSENT. MEANING THE THE SECOND OFFENSE IS SATIN'S -- EXACTLY AS THE FIRST OFFENSE AS OPPOSED TO WHAT. WE CALL ONE THIRD THE MIDDLE TERM. WHEN THE SITUATION APPLIES WHERE THERE'S MULTIPLE VICTIMS OR A SINGLE VICTIM IN MULTIPLE ATTACKS? THE COURT MUST IMPOSE THE FULL CONSECUTIVE TERM SO. A SIX YEAR RAPE CASE SECURE CONVICTION WITH A SECOND SIX YEAR CONVICTION BECOMES A TWELVE YEAR. CONVICTION -- THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS FOR THE THREE STRIKES LAW TOWN SENDS INVOLVING A THREE STRIKES CONVICTION WOULD NOT BE COVERED. UNDER -- TWELVE SEVENTY NINE AND KIDNAPPING OF A CHILD WITH INTENT TO PROBABLY DEPRIVE. WOULD NOT BE COVERED UNDER THIS SO THAT THE AUTHOR HAS MADE SOME VERY. SERIOUS AND NUANCED. EFFORTS. TO HOW THE STATUTE APPLIED TO THE MORE BASIC FELONY OFFENSES THAT OCCUR. IN THE STATE AND STILL WE LIVE THE THE JUDGES WITH THE DISCRETION TO IMPOSE MORE. IN CLOSING I WOULD TAKE YOU BACK TO THE CASE THAT OVER. THAT SET THIS IN MOTION PEOPLE VERSUS MCGILL BACK IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX ON THE PART OF MCGILL I ASK YOU TO PAY ATTENTION. TO IS FOOTNOTE. FOR WHEN THE COURT RICH RENDERED ITS DECISION THAT THE DOUBLE BASS TERM LAW WAS -- NOT AT YOUR FOUR MINUTES. NOT LEAVE THEM MUCH TIME OUTSIDE ALL I ASK YOU DO ON IS TO FOLLOW THE OLD QUOTE FROM JUSTICE FRANKFURTER THAT WISDOM TOO pTO REJECTED BECAUSE IT COMES LATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MAY BEGIN SIR -- YES SENATOR BRADFORD DESCRIBE CALIFORNIA SENTENCING AS ONE OF THE MOST COMPLEX IN THE NATION I THINK THAT KIND OF UNDER CELLS A LITTLE BIT -- I TOOK AN INFORMAL POLL OF MY COLLEAGUES AT THE UC BERKELEY SCHOOL OF LAW. AND THE CONSENSUS IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S SENTENCING SCHEME IS BY A GOOD MEASURE THE MOST COMPLEX IN THE NATION. AND THAT'S BECAUSE AMONG OTHER THINGS IT'S GOT ABOUT FIVE DIFFERENT LAYERS WHO COMPLEXITY. MOST OTHER STATES HAVE ONE OR TWO PLAYERS WE HAVE -- FIVE AND I'M IN THE LIMITED TIME HAVE I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE OF THE PRACTICAL EFFECT OF THIS -- ABOUT A MONTH AGO I GOT A LETTER. FROM THE CDC ADDRESS TO THE MOST SENIOR AND PROBABLY THE MOST SCHOLARLY JUDGE IN OUR COUNTY. ASKING HIM TO CORRECT THE LEGAL HEIR THAT HE MADE IN THE SENSE. AND I WENT OVER TO THE COURTHOUSE TO LOOK ATTHE COURT FILE AND I WHEN I DID I REALIZE THAT THIS LETTER WAS JUST. THE LAST IN A SERIES OF LETTERS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS ASKING TO CORRECT THIS ERROR. WHICH HE REFUSED TO TAKE ANY ACTION ON IT INSISTING THAT HE WAS RIGHT AND THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS WHICH ACTUALLY WAS RIGHT IN THIS CASE WAS WRONG. SO I WAS CURIOUS I ASKED THE CLERK TO GET A LOT OF THESE LETTERS. AND SHE SAID WELL I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY A LOT. SO THAT KIND OF PIQUED MY CURIOSITY SO I I EMAILED THE PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER AT THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. AND I ASKED HIM HOW MANY OF THESE LETTERS DO YOU SEND OUT. SO EMAIL ME BACK HE SAYS IS INTERESTING YOU ASK THAT QUESTION BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR'S BEEN ASKING THE SAME QUESTION. ANY SAID WE WE SENT OUT A COUPLE HUNDRED OF THESE IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS. AND APPARENTLY IN THE REVISED BUDGET FOR THIS YEAR THERE'S TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO BOLSTER THE FOR THIS UNIT -- THAT EXPLORE SENTENCE DISCREPANCIES. SO THAT'S THAT'S GOOD THE JUDGES THE LAWYERS I LOOKED AT SOME OF THE OPPOSITION AND I TRIED TO DO THE NUMBERS AND I DON'T GET ANYWHERE NEAR THE NUMBERS THAT THEY GET. AND I THAT'S I MEAN I'M RIGHT NO WRONG I DON'T KNOW THAT IT DOES AFTER THIRTY FIVE YEARS OF DOING THIS THE ONE THING I KNOW. FOR SURE ABOUT SENTENCING IS THAT NOTHING CERTAIN. AND I MAYBE WRONG THERE MAY BE SOME OBSCURE SENTENCING RULER ENHANCEMENT BURIED DEEP IN THE PENAL CODE. BUT I THINK THAT'S THE POINT THAT WHEN YOU WRITE THESE LAWS YOU EXPECT THEM TO BE. EXECUTED IN UNIFORM A PROPORTIONAL MANNER AND YOU EXPECT THEM TO HAVE SOME DETERRENT EFFECT. BUT IF THE SENIOR AND SCHOLARLY JUDGE CAN'T GET IT RIGHT IF LAWYERS ON BOTH SIDES CAME TO GET THE ARITHMETIC RIGHT. THEN HOW CAN YOU EXPECT THE LAWS YOU ENACT. WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN A UNIFORM A PROPORTIONAL MANNER. AND OF WE DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW CAN YOU EXPECT. THE AVERAGE CITIZEN. THE HAVE ANY DETERRENT EFFECT ON THIS. THIS BILL IS NOT GONNA SWING OPEN THE PRISON GATES. IT'S NOT GONNA SAN RECIDIVISM RATES SOARING AND IT'S NOT GONNA PREVENT JUDGES FROM STRICTLY PUNISHING. SERIOUS VIOLENT AND SEX OFFENSES BUT IT IS THE FIRST STEP. IN UNTANGLING IN SIMPLIFYING. WHAT IS THE MOST COMPLEX AND FRUSTRATING SENTENCING LAWS IN THE NATION AND THAT'S WHAT HAS MY SUPPORT [inaudible] THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MIKE A DOCTOR OFF ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE PROUD CO SPONSOR OF THIS LEGISLATION AND URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANGELIQUE YORK WITH NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU. OTHER ANY OTHER [inaudible] ARE. IS THERE AND THE THERE FLOOR ARE NOT OF CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDER ASSOCIATION WE SUPPORT THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION GOOD MORNING. TO MATTHEWS ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION AND WE ARE IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION. THE PRACTICAL EFFECT OF SP TWELVE SEVENTY NINE IS TO GIVE A VOLUME DISCOUNT TO CRIMINALS WHO VICTIMIZE FOR A MORE INDIVIDUALS. OR THOSE WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE SUBJECT TO A SIGNIFICANT HANSON CONSIDER SOMEONE CONVICTED OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING WITH SIX VICTIMS. LET'S ASSUME THAT THE JUDGE IMPOSED THE LOWER TERM OF FIVE YEARS FOR THE PRINCIPLE TERM. AND SENTENCED THE DEFENDANT CONSECUTIVELY FOR THE OTHER FIVE VICTIMS FOR TOTAL SENTENCE OF EIGHTEEN YEARS FOUR MONTHS. UNDER S. B. TWELVE SEVENTY NINE THE MAXIMUM SENTENCE FOR THIS DEFENDANT WOULD BE CAPPED AT DOUBLE THE BASE TERM OR TEN YEARS. THAT'S ALMOST A 50% SENTENCE REDUCTION AND EFFECTIVELY GIVE THE DEFENDANT THREE FREE VICTIMS. VIOLENT OFFENDERS ARE THE MOST LIKELY TO BENEFIT FROM THIS. AS NON VIOLENT OFFENDERS ARE ALREADY ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE UNDER PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN AFTER SERVING JUST THE PRINCIPAL TAM. S. B. TWELVE SEVENTY NINE COMPROMISES THE RIGHTS OF CRIME VICTIMS TO RECEIVE JUSTICE AND JEOPARDIZES THE SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITIES FOR THESE REASONS RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE. YES THANK YOU A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS BUT I'M DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY TOMAR TOKAT ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL. SENTENCING STATUTES IN CALIFORNIA ARE ARE EXTENSIVE BUT THEY ARE NOT INDECIPHERABLE TO THE PROSECUTORS THE DEFENSE ATTORNEYS AND THE JUDGES WHO WORK WITH THEM EVERY SINGLE DAY. IN FACT THE MAXIMUM THAT A DEFENDANT FACES ON EVERY CASE IS DETERMINED. IN EACH CASE BY THE PROSECUTORS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS AND THE JUDGES WHO HANDLE THESE CASES THIS IS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WHEN YOU DO IT FOR A LIVING. YOU LEARN IT AND YOU DO IT CORRECTLY OF COURSE THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE HUMAN ERROR. HUMAN ERROR HAPPENS IN EVERY SCENARIO IN LIFE BUT JUST BECAUSE THERE COULD BE HUMAN ERROR DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE GET RID OF A BOTH A PROCESS THAT WORKS. IN FACT THE CURRENT SENTENCING LAWS SERVED A VERY IMPORTANT PURPOSE THEY DIFFERENTIATE THE PERSON WHO USES A GUN FROM THE PERSON WHO DOES NOT USE A GUN DURING THE COMMISSION OF AN OFFENSE. THE CURRENT LAWS DIFFERENTIATE THE PERSON WHO SERIOUSLY INJURES A HUMAN BEING DURING THE COMMISSION OF OF AN OFFENSE FROM THE PERSON WHO DOES NOT CAUSE GREAT BODILY INJURY. THE CURRENT LAW DIFFERENTIATES THE PERSON WHO COMMITS ONE CRIME AGAINST ONE VICTIM FROM THE PERSON THAT COMMITS MULTIPLE CRIMES AGAINST MULTIPLE VICTIMS. THAT'S WHAT THE CURRENT LAWS ARE THEREFORE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION ALL OF THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT HAPPEN WITHIN A CRIME AND NOT TO TREAT EVERYBODY EXACTLY THE SAME WAY. THIS BILL HAS NO EXCEPTIONS FOR GUN USE WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA AND SPEAKING FOR LOS ANGELES WE HAVE A HUGE PROBLEM WITH GUN VIOLENCE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. THIS BILL ALSO DOES NOT MAKE AN EXCEPTION FOR A CAUSING GREAT BODILY INJURY OR FOR HAVING MULTIPLE VICTIMS ROUTINELY IN LOS ANGELES WE SEE. OF INDIVIDUALS WHO COMMIT ARMED ROBBERIES AGAINST MULTIPLE INDIVIDUAL SOMETIMES IN ONE NIGHT BY WAY OF EXAMPLE WE ONCE PROSECUTED ARE FOR A DEFENDANT WHO COMMITTED FIVE SEPARATE ARMED ROBBERIES IN ONE NIGHT. AGAINST EIGHT DIFFERENT VICTIMS ONE OF THE VICTIMS WAS AN ELDERLY WOMAN THAT HE SHOVED TO THE GROUND BREAKING ONE OF HER LIMBS. UNDER THIS BILL THE JUDGE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE GREAT BODILY INJURY ALL OF THE OTHER ICTIMS WHERE HE POINTED A GUN IN THEIR FACES TOLD THEM HE WAS GOING TO KILL THEM. BECAUSE THERE'S GOING TO BE A CAP UNDER THIS BILL IF IT WERE TO PASS THE MAXIMUM THAT PERSON WOULD GET IS TEN YEARS WHEN REALLY HE SHOULD BE FACING WELL OVER. THIRTY FIVE FOR ALL OF THE DIFFERENT VICTIMS ALL OF THE TIME TO USE THE GONE ALL OF THE TIMES THAT HE COULD HAVE FIRED THAT GUN WHAT IF ONE OF THE VICTIMS HAD ACTUALLY JUMPED UP AND TRIED TO TAKE THE GUN AWAY. THAT HAPPENS THEN PEOPLE DIE AND THAT'S WHY THE CURRENT SENTENCING STATUTES RE IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL OF THE DIFFERENT SCENARIOS. AND IMAGINE AND EVEN THOUGH THE BILL HAS EXCEPTIONS FOR OF MANY SEX CRIMES IT DOESN'T COVER EVERY SEX CRIME. IT A COACH OR A TEACHER WHO MOLESTS MULTIPLE FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN YEAR OLDS IS NOT GOING TO GET CONSECUTIVE SENTENCING UNDER THIS BILL THERE'S GOING TO BE A CAP OF SIX YEARS FOR MOLESTING. MULTIPLE FIFTEEN OR FOURTEEN YEAR OLD SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL GO AHEAD AND MOLEST THIRTY OTHERS BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET PUNISHED FOR IT [inaudible] SHOOTINGS. IF YOU END UP SHOOTING AT MULTIPLE PEOPLE WITH THE INTENT TO KILL ASSUMING THERE'S NO -- DELIBERATION OR PREMEDITATION SO IT'S NOT A LIFE OFFENSE. THE MULTIPLE SHOOTINGS WILL GET THE SAME SENTENCE AS THOUGH YOU SHOT AT ONE PERSON UNDER THIS BILL. LAST YEAR OUR FIREARMS ENHANCEMENTS BECAME DISCRETIONARY FOR THE JUDGE IN IN FACT THAT WAS SENATOR BRADFORD'S BILL. BUT NOW IF THIS BILL WERE TO BECOME LAW JUDGES WHO WANT TO IMPOSE A FIREARMS ENHANCEMENT IN A PARTICULAR CASE BECAUSE IS THE APPROPRIATE THING TO DO. ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. AND EVEN IF THEY DID IF YOU REACH A CERTAIN CAP IF YOU REACH A CERTAIN CAP YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO IMPOSE IT BECAUSE HEY WE RUN OUT OF NUMBERS BECAUSE IT'S MORE THAN DOUBLE THE BASED TERM THAT'S TAKEN. THE PUNISHMENT SHOULD ALWAYS FIT THE CRIME. BUT THAT ALSO REQUIRES THAT WE NOT FORGET THE INNOCENT VICTIMS OF CRIME VICTIMS OF CRIME DESERVE JUSTICE AND SIMPLIFYING MATHEMATICS AND GETTING RID OF A THE THEREFORE THEIR SUFFERING. ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE ALL THESE MULTIPLE VICTIMS IMAGINE YOU HAVE A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD KID AND YOU SAY TO THAT COULD YOU KNOW WHAT THE PERSON WHO MOLESTED YOU. I'M SORRY WE'RE NOT GOING GOING TO BE ABLE TO SENTENCE THAT PERSON FOR YOUR MOLESTATION BECAUSE YOU HAPPEN TO BE KID NUMBER FIVE YOU HAPPEN TO BE KID NUMBER SIX THAT IS NOT JUSTICE. SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL AND WE ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU THANK YOU OR ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. JOHN DEMOING US THE CALIFORNIA POLICE ASSOCIATION OPPOSITIONS LIKE TO ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE MY COLLEAGUES [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN BRIDGE IS SHOWN MUCH LOWER ON THE AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. PARDEE QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS [inaudible] SUPPORT -- FIRST MISTER BRADFORD COULD YOU RESPOND TO THE ARGUMENT FROM THE REPRESENTATIVE. OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF LA ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO PUNISH PEOPLE -- FOR MOLESTATION. I I REALLY WANT YOU IF I CAN STOP LAUGHING AT THE COMICAL PRESENTATION THAT I JUST LISTEN TO I MEAN. IT'S ONE OF THE MOST. GROSS MIS REPRESENT REPRESENTATIONS OF THE PIECE OF EIGHT YEARS OF BEING HERE IN THIS LEGISLATURE IT'S FICTIONAL AT BEST. PEOPLE WHO COMMIT SEX CRIMES WILL STILL BE CONVICTED FOR THOSE SEX CRIMES EVEN THEN USING OF A GUN IT DOESN'T STRIKE ANY OF THAT OUT OF THAT. ANY SHE MADE TO REFERENCE TO GUN ENHANCEMENTS I PASSED A BILL LAST YEAR THE GOVERNOR SIGNED IT ON JUDICIAL DISCRETION ON GUN ENHANCEMENT BENNETT HAPPENS DON'T GO AWAY YOU JUST GIVE THE JUDGE'S DISCRETION AT SENTENCING TIME. SEEM ASK HERE YOU HAVE TO BE A MATHEMATICIAN TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH TIME SOMEONE GETS ARE. BASED ON OUR CURRENT ALL A SENTENCING LAW SHOW. I I'M PANEL LOSS -- A DOCTOR QUIRK BECAUSE I I'M INSULTED BY THAT PRESENTATION BECAUSE IT TOTALLY REPORT RE I MISS REPRESENTS EVERYTHING THAT THIS THE PIECE OF LEGISLATION AYE AYES IS INTENDING TO DO. HERE TO SIMPLIFY IT'S NOT TO LET ANYONE OUT OF JAIL IT'S NOT TOO WELL ABOUT A WEEK IN OUR OUR SENTENCING LAWS WHATSOEVER. SO TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION AT THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE THAT IT STILL GIVES THE JUDGE AND THE PROSECUTOR THE SAME TO ALL WERE JUST SEEN WHEN YOU SENTENCE SOMEBODY WHEN WE WE MAKE IT WHAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND IT. WELL BETTER ARGUMENT WAS -- IF. AT SOME LOWER LEVEL I'M NOT QUITE SURE. WHAT'S INCLUDED IN THIS INVITE ISN'T BUT IF YOU MOLESTED SOME LOWER LEVEL -- SHE USED A TEACHER EXAMPLE TO CRIMES RATHER THAN FIVE I MEAN I I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOUR BILL WELL ENOUGH NOW. TO YOUR EXPERTS ARE SAYING NOW TELL ME. SPECIFIC EXCEPTION COULD CLOSE TO LIKE. THERE'S A SPECIFIC EXCEPTION FOR SIX SIX SEVEN POINT SIX WHICH ALLOWS FOR CONSECUTIVE SENTENCING FOR FORCIBLE ANY SORT OF FORCIBLE MOLESTATION IMPACT. AND WHAT ABOUT -- FIVE ARMED ROBBERIES IN ONE NIGHT. WOULD YOU WOULD YOU GO TO DOUBLE WHAT IT IS FOR NON BRIBERY OR WOULD YOU DO IF THE YOU YOU WILL DOUBLE THE BASE TERM SO IF THE JUDGE SAYS OKAY ARMED ROBBERY THE MAXIMUM SENTENCES. TAKE TEN YEARS YOU GET TWENTY YEARS FOR THAT. THAT'S NOT A LIGHT SENTENCE AT ALL. YOU GET TWENTY YEARS FOR THAT SO WHATEVER THAT SENTENCES WERE SEEN DOUBLE THAT. AND AYE NW SHOULD EXPECT TO DO MORE THAN THAT BASED ON THE CRIME THAT WAS COMMITTED WERE SAYING DOUBLE THAT BASED TERM SO WE EVEN TO JUDGE USE. THAT -- THE MINIMUM SENTENCING -- THE MIDDLE RANGE OR THE MAXIMUM RANGE WE SEE DOUBLE THAT BASED BASIS YEAH I AGREE THAT. A PEOPLE DON'T CALCULATE WHAT THE TERM IS GOING TO BE WHEN THEY GO OUT AND COMMIT A CRIME. YEAH SO THAT I DON'T SEE THE DETERRENCE VALUE FURTHER FOR SOMEBODY'S BEEN IMPRISONED TWENTY YEARS. THERE ARE DIFFERENT PERSON COMING OUT TYPICALLY THESE ARE DONE BY YOUNG MAN AND I GONNA TALK ABOUT MIDDLE AGED MAN. SO I DON'T SEE THE POINT IN KEEPING THE MEN FOR THESE VERY LONG TIMES. NOR BUT MAYBE YOU AND I COULD WORK TOGETHER ON GETTING RID OF SOME OF THIS COMPLEXITY SO INSTEAD OF FIVE LAYERS LAYERS THERE'S CHIU. OR WHATEVER RATHER THAN -- THIS APPROACH WHICH I AGREE WITH THEM IN FACT I'D LIKE TO BE A CO AUTHOR. HOW BECAUSE I THINK TOO MANY PEOPLE END UP IN JAIL FOR TO LOG? AND IT'S NOT A DETERRENT WAY AND TO KEEP SOMEBODY AND YEARS INSTEAD A TWENTY BUT THE COMPLEXITY SOUNDS LIKE A REAL ISSUE AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT FOR THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF LA IT SOUNDS LIKE PEOPLE DO MAKE MISTAKES. AND I THINK WE OUGHT TO GET RID OF THAT AND PERHAPS YOU AND I COULD WORK TOGETHER ON IT NEXT YEAR HAVING SAID THAT. I DON'T THINK THE BILL IS BEEN MOVED SO LET ME MOVE THE BELL THANK YOU. AB MISTER LACKEY HAS A QUESTION OR COMMENT. YEAH CERTAINLY BOTH -- CENTER BRADFORD I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR YOU SELECT SO PLEASE DON'T TAKE MY COMMENTS AS AN INSULT BUT I AFTER COLLEGES LACY IT. AND I LIKE TO ASK -- LARA DISTRICT ATTORNEY TO CLARIFY THE CLAIM [inaudible] AND TO ADDRESS SPECIFICALLY THE EXAMPLE THAT YOU USED TO EIGHTY EIGHT DAY IS NOT INCLUDED AND SIXTY OR SIX SIX SEVEN POINT SIX IS NOT CORRECT. I WAS REFERRING TO TWO EIGHTY EIGHT C. WHICH IS A QUALITY NATION OF A FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN YEAR OLD -- CHILD MOLESTATION ISN'T NECESSARILY ALWAYS FORCIBLE SO WE'RE NOT ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT FORCEABLE RAPE ABOUT. IT'S IT'S A VERY DELICATE SUBJECT AND THEY ARE OF KIDS CAN BE MOLESTED WITHOUT BEING FORCED INTO IT IN OTHER WORDS I THINK WE'VE SEEN THAT -- PLAY OUT EVEN IN THE NEWS VERY RECENTLY WITH THE YOU KNOW THE OLYMPICS COMMITTEE FOR EXAMPLE OF EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED. TO THOSE GIRLS -- IS NOT NECESSARILY FORCIBLE BUT IT HAPPENS AND IF THEY'RE FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS OLD IN CALIFORNIA IT'S TWO EIGHTY EIGHT C. AND UNDER -- THIS BILL THE MAXIMUM OF FOR THE BASE TERM IS THREE YEARS SO IF YOU DOUBLED UP THAT SIX YEARS SO IF YOU MOLEST THIRTY KIDS FORTY KIDS WHO ARE FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS OLD. YES YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO GET SIX YEARS FOR THAT AND THERE'S GOING TO BE GOOD TIME -- CREDITS FOR THAT AS WELL SO YOU'RE NOT IN -- SIX YEARS AND CERTAINLY I DON'T SEE THAT IS LAUGHABLE IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM. I THINK THAT -- THERE THERE WOULD BE SOME VERY SERIOUS INJUSTICES TO VICTIMS. WE CAN TALK ABOUT TIMES. TIME MEANT AND REHABILITATION BUT THERE COMES A POINT TO WHERE SOME OF THESE CRIMES ARE BEING CONVICTED. ARE MORE THAN JUST. LAPSES OF JUDGMENT WHEN MAKING IT SOUND LIKE IT'S SOMEBODY -- MAKING THE CHOICE TO DRIVE TO FASTER. NO WE HAVE VICTIMS THAT ARE. IMPACTED BY SOMEONE IS CRIMINAL OF BEHAVIORS FOR THEIR LIVES. THEY GET NO RELIEF FROM FROM THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO BE VERY VERY CAREFUL -- IN. AND OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO SERVE VICTIMS AS WELL AS PERPETRATORS AND SO FOR THAT REASON I WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT US [inaudible] THANK YOU. BUT ANYMORE COMMENT. YES -- SENATOR BRADFORD MAYBE YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES CAN SPEAK TO THIS I HAVE A QUESTION SPECIFICALLY AS IT RELATES. TO SEX CRIMES BUT MAYBE MORE GENERALLY. IF YOU COMMIT ONE OF THESE CRIMES MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT -- THEY'RE STACKABLE -- IN TERMS OF THE SENTENCING IS THAT TRUE ANSWER. THAT THEY'RE STACKABLE. SENTENCING SO MAY BE ONE OF THE LAWYERS COULD SPEAK TO THIS YEAR FOR INTO SEX OFFENSES IN HIM YES UNDER SIX SIX SEVEN POINT. SIX THEY'RE FULLY STACKABLE THAN IT DOES INCLUDE. A LEWD AND LASCIVIOUS ACTS WITH A CHILD UNDER TO EIGHTY EIGHT BE IT ALSO INCLUDES CONTINUOUS SEXUAL MISCONDUCT WITH A CHILD UNDER. TO EIGHTY EIGHT POINT FIVE IN THOSE ARE FULL TERM STACKING SO OF FORCIBLE MOST OF MY THREE YEARS SIX YEARS EIGHT YEARS. SHE COULD GO [inaudible] EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT AND ITSELF AND I'M SORRY EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT THAT ADDS UP DOESN'T IT YES IT. VERY QUICKLY VERY QUICKLY I'M SORRY IF I INTERRUPTED YOU DID YOU WANNA FINISH WHAT YOU WERE SAYING AHEAD WITH. THIS [inaudible] WE ACCEPTED. WHAT THE EXEMPTION UNDER SIX SIX SEVEN POINT SIX COULD YOU SAY THAT AGAIN IN THE MICROPHONE? THE THE DOUBLE BASS TERM IS SPECIFICALLY EXEMPTED UNDER. TWELVE SEVENTY NINE UNDER SIX SIX SEVEN POINT SIX AND SECTION TWO ELEVEN SEVENTY POINT ONE A AYE TO IN THE BILL. THAT'S WILL REFER. AND CAN I ADD THAT IF IT'S UNDER CERTAIN SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES LEWD LASCIVIOUS ACTS CARRIES A LIFE SENTENCE. UNDER SIX SIX SEVEN POINT. SIX ONE THANK YOU SO SENATOR BRADFORD AYE I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION FOR YOU. IS THE INTENT OF THIS BILL TO LET EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO GETS CONVICTED OUT. NO I I MEAN IT'S THAT'S THE MOST RIDICULOUS DOES REFERENCE HERE WERE ALL ABOUT CRIMINAL JUSTICE HERE IT'S NOT A SINGLE PERSON IN THIS BUILDING THAT WANT CRIMINALS WALKING FREE ON THE STREET WE WANT PEOPLE SENTENCED FOR THE CRIMES THAT THEY COMMIT. WERE JUST SEEM TO NOT THROW PEOPLE'S LIVES AWAY BY OUR KICK SENTENCING. SHOP MECHANISM THAT WAS IN. AN ACTIVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN ON THIS WHOLE TOUGH ON CRIME MOVEMENT WE HAD DOUBLE THE BASED TERM WASN'T ACTING IN CALIFORNIA IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX WE HAD IT FOR TWENTY YEARS UNTIL WE DECIDE TO BECOME TOUGH ON CRIME AND COME OUT WITH THIS ARE KICK OUCH. LARA METHOD OF A SENTENCING PEOPLE RIGHT NOW SO IT WORKED ALL THE WAY UP UNTIL THAT TIME AND IT'S THIS WHOLE ENHANCEMENT IT'S REACHED OUR RESULT OF THIS WHOLE TOUGH ON CRIME MOVEMENT YOU GO. AND BASED ON OUR OPPOSITION CRIME HAS NOT DECREASED SO OBVIOUSLY ARE TOUGH ON CRIME METHODS HAVE NOT WORKED SO ALL WERE SEEN AS NOT DON'T THOUGH SOMEONE'S LIFE AWAY. BASED ON SOME ARCHAIC BAH CALCULATIONTHAT WE CAME UP WITH TWENTY YEARS AGO AND GIVE PEOPLE A CHANCE AND AND AND IT WOULD APPEAR JUST SENTENCE. THANK YOU SO I TO WANT TO ECHO SOME OF THE SENTIMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK ABOUT THIS BILL -- YOU'RE RIGHT. THESE ARE NOT MATH PROBLEMS THEY ARE PEOPLE. WHO COME BEFORE JUDGES WHO ARE REPRESENTED BY ATTORNEYS IN COURT HOUSES WHO OFTENTIMES ARE FACED [inaudible] BY JURIES HOPEFULLY A BUNCH OF THEIR PEERS. AND SO WITH ALL DUE RESPECT. YOU KNOW THESE ARE NOT. ELSE OUT EXAMPLES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT [inaudible] IT. THEY ARE HUMAN BEINGS SOME OF THEM ARE TRYING TO REHABILITATE MAYBE SOME OF THEM ARE NOT BUT THAT IS CERTAINLY NOT FOR US TO DECIDE. IT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GO BEFORE A JUDGE WHEN YOU HAVE DUE PROCESS AND WHEN BOTH SIDES ARE PRESENTING EVIDENCE. AND SO I MIGHT QUESTION ALWAYS ESPECIALLY WITH THE NUMBER OF THESE BILLS THAT COME BEFORE US. IS IF WE ARE JUST TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO LOCK PEOPLE UP FOR EVER MORE IF WE ARE TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE UPHOLDING DUE PROCESS WHILE PUTTING FORTH AN ALLOWING WAYS TO PUT FORTH COMMONSENSE EVIDENCE. SO THAT FOLKS CAN BE TRIED. THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU. OR ANY OTHER. QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MR BRADFORD YOU MAY. CONCLUDE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AND I WANT TO THANK -- THE ROBUST DISCUSSION HERE THIS MORNING AND APPLE. ARE THE INTENT OF THIS LEGISLATION IS NOT THOUGH OPEN THE FLOOD GATES ALLOW CRIMINALS TO RUN FREE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OUR INTENT HERE IS TO COME UP WITH EIGHT SENSIBLE SYMBOLIZE METHOD AND WHICH WE AW SENTENCE INDIVIDUALS AS FONG. MISTER LACKEY -- STATED -- WE HAVE THE ULTIMATE AND DUE RESPECT FOR LONG FONG THE LAW HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IT'S NOT OUR INTENT AT ALL. BUT AGAIN EVIDENCE IF PROVEN THAT [inaudible] MADE OF THE DEATH SENTENCE HAS NOT DETERRED NOT ONE PERSON FROM COMMITTING MURDER. BUT WE HAVE A DEATH SENTENCE AND MANY STATE BUT IT HAS NOT DETERRED PEOPLE FROM. COMMITTING MURDER TO SHAME HERE HAVING THIS ARCHAIC. MY WAY OF CALCULATING SENTENCE IS NOT A SINGLE CROCK CRIMINALS THINKING YOU KNOW LET ME CALCULATE THIS BEFORE I GO DO THIS ARMED ROBBERY AND IF I DO THIS AND I DO THIS AND I DO IT MULTIPLE TIMES. THEY'RE NOT THINKING LIKE THAT. THIS IS A COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO ADDRESS A PROBLEM THAT WE CREATED IN THIS LEGISLATURE TWENTY YEARS AGO AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK RAGO.

S.. CALIFORNIA IS IN A POSITION IS WELL POSITIONED TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS GREAT OPPORTUNITY -- ON TOP OF THE MANY MINOR USES OF INDUSTRIAL HEMP THE BENEFITS FOR FARMERS ARE NOT ONLY FINANCIAL BUT ALSO PRACTICAL. CALIFORNIA'S NO STRANGER TO DROUGHT LIKE CONDITIONS AND INDUSTRIAL HEMP HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE IMMENSE VALUE TO FARMERS AS IT REQUIRES FAR LESS WATER THAN MOST CROPS. REQUIRES LITTLE TO NO PESTICIDES AND ACTUALLY READ GENERATES THE SOIL. INDUSTRIAL HEMP REQUIRES. I DID ALL THAT SOMEONE SKIP ON THAT THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF INDUSTRIAL HEMP IS A NATURAL FIT FOR CALIFORNIANS ARID CLIMATE. AT ONE POINT WE WERE THE ACTUALLY THE LEADER WHEN WE ENACTED SP FIVE SIXTY SIX BY SENATOR LENO WHICH ESTABLISH AN INDUSTRIAL HEMP FARMING PROGRAM. BUT AND FORCEFULLY PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT LARGELY AND DID MUCH OF THE PROGRESS BY LOPPING INDUSTRIAL HEMP -- THE AGRICULTURE COMMODITY WITH THE INTOXICATING RELATIVE -- RELATIVE A CANNABIS ALSO SINCE THEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAD UPDATED THE THAT THE FARM ACT.

ACTUALLY THIS BILL CAME TO ME FROM MY LOCAL LOCAL FARMER SO WE JUST FINISHED IN THE ARAB VALLEY -- SIXTEEN YEARS OF LITIGATION ON WATER RIGHTS IN THE BIG LOSERS WAS THE AGRICULTURE COMMUNITY THEY'RE GETTING THEIR WATER CUT BY 44% OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS -- THE PRIMARY CROP IS ALFALFA WHICH REQUIRE SEVEN ACRE FEET OF WATER.

AND SET UP -- THE OUR MANUFACTURING COMPANIES% BECAUSE THAT THEY HAVE WILL BE THERE. AND TO ALL THE NAYSAYERS OUT THERE WHO WOULD THEN SAY WELL MY GOD NO ONE ELSE IS GONNA BE GROWING CORN OR ALFALFA THEY'RE ONLY GOING TO BE GROWING HEMP WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THEM.

WE YOU KNOW AS THE GOVERNOR SAYS WE GET THE NEW NORMAL IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW CLIMATE CHANGE WHICH ARE AIR CLIMATE ANYWAY CLIMATE CHANGE WE HAVE WE HAVE TO BE SMARTER LIVE GUIDE. FARMERS WHO WANT TO REMAIN IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR THE ONLY WAY THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT IS IS CONVERT THEIR THEIR CROPS THAT THAT FIT.

NEXT WE HAVE SENATOR PELL. S. B. ELEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN ITEM NUMBER. ELEVEN MISTER CHAIRMAN I WAS READING RECENTLY A BOOK ABOUT GEORGE WASHINGTON. I JUST WANT TO DISCLOSE THAT HE GREW AND ALSO. INTERESTING READING ABOUT HIM -- OKAY MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS -- TODAY I'M PRESENTING -- THIS BILL -- EIGHT ELEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN THIS IS A BILL THE ELIM LIMITS THE INVOLUNTARY. PRE TRIAL COMPLETE CONFINEMENT OF A PERSON SOLELY BASED ON HIS OR HER MENTAL INCAPACITY TO STAND TRIAL. FOR WHAT NO LONGER THAN TWO YEARS. CURRENTLY THREE YEARS WE'RE GOING FROM THREE YEARS TO TWO YEARS -- HIT UPDATES ARCHAIC STANDARDS AND DEFINITIONS WITHIN THE EXISTING LAW. NOW BY SHORTENING THE MAXIMUM COMMITMENT PERIOD FOR FROM THREE YEARS. THE BILL INCREASES THE VEIL ABILITY OF PLACEMENTS AND RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT. HOSPITALS DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS FOR THE TREATMENT AND TO REMOVE THE BALLOT. INCOMPETENCE STAND TRIAL. SPIDERMAN -- I'LL BE BRIEF AND IN. THE IN ADDITION IT'S BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT -- THE BILL WILL SAVE MONEY. SHORTER STAYS -- AND OUR STATE HOSPITALS DO KNOW THAT WE ADDED A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO THE STATE HOSPITAL IN THE BUDGET. JUST TO HANDLE INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE SO OVERCROWDED. WITH THESE INCOMPETENT STAND TRIALS THAT WE HAD TO ADD ALL THIS MONEY SO THAT COUNTIES. COULD FIND PLACES AND GREAT PLACES FOR PEOPLE THAT WERE INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL. SO THIS IS A COST SAVER IF WE APPROVE THIS BILL AND I'LL TURN OVER TO MY WITNESSES MISTER TURN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LAURA AND MY NAME IS LAURA ARNOLD I'VE BEEN A PUBLIC DEFENDER FROM MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS. I CHAIR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS MENTAL HEALTH AND CIVIL COMMITMENT COMMITTEE AND ON BEHALF OF C. PDA AND PUBLIC DEFENDER FROM ALL OVER CALIFORNIA. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK SENATOR BALLOT HIS STAFF FROM WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL AND I WOULD URGE YOU TO VOTE I'ANSON ABOUT. ELEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE TREATMENT OF MEDS ON ITS HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY OVER THE PAST FORTY FOUR YEARS IF YOU THINK ABOUT A HALF CENTURY AGO THEY WERE USING STE SHOCK TREATMENTS RIGHT. BUT NOW MEDICATION TREATMENT HAS REALLY INVOLVED AND WE'VE REALIZED THAT WITH EFFECTIVE MEDICATION TREATMENT PEOPLE CAN BE RESTORED TO COMPETENCY MUCH MORE QUICKLY. THAN ANYBODY EVER WOULD HAVE IMAGINED HAVE SIGNED YOUR LIMIT WAS SELECTED -- COMPETENCY COMMITMENTS ARE DESIGNED TO BE SHORT TERM THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT REALLY MEANT TO BE ALTERNATIVE SENTENCING SCHEME. THEY'RE DESIGNED TO TAYLOR ACUTE MENTAL ILLNESS WHICH IMPAIR A CRIMINAL DEFENDANT TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT HE CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON CAN ENTER A PLEA CAN'T VIOLENT. AGO I'M WITH THE MOTION HE CAN'T GO TO TRIAL. ON THOSE WHO ARE NOT RENDER COMPETENT WITHIN THE MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE INCOMPETENT ARE RESTORED CONSTANCY WITHIN SIX MONTHS. THOSE WHO ARE RESTORED WITHIN A YEAR LIKELY NEVER WILL BE. AS THIS GROUP KNOWS THERE'S A LIMITED NUMBER OF TREATMENT BEDS AVAILABLE AND THE MOST EXPENSIVE ONES IN THE STATE ARE IN THE STATE HOSPITAL THERE IN HIGH DEMAND. RIGHT NOW THE WEIGHT OF THE WAIT LIST FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE WAITING TO WHO ARE SITTING IN JAIL WAITING TO GET INTO STATE HOSPITALS AS MORE THAN A THOUSAND PEOPLE. IT'S TAKING UP TO SIX MONTHS IN LOS ANGELES FOR PEOPLE TO GET PLACED IN A TREATMENT FACILITY. AND AS WE ALL KNOW JAIL IS THE WORST POSSIBLE ENVIRONMENT FOR A PERSON SUFFERING FROM SEVERE AND ACUTE MENTAL ILLNESS. AND BY SHORTENING THE MAXIM COMMITMENT AS THE ELEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN WILL INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF PLACEMENTS IN RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES HOSPITALS AND DEVELOPMENT CENTERS. WILL ACCELERATE THE PLACEMENT AND TREATMENT OF INCOMPETENT DEFENDANTS AND WILL SAVE THE TAXPAYERS MONEY. IN LINE WITH IMPORTANT CONSTITUTIONAL SPEEDY TRIAL RIGHTS OF DEFENDANTS AND VICTIMS TREATMENT WILL BEGIN SOONER COMPETENCY RESTORATION WILL OCCUR MORE QUICKLY AND CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS CAN BE REINSTATED IN CASES CAN BE ADJUDICATED. FOR THOSE REASONS I URGE YOUR VOTE FOR AYE VOTE IN FAVOR OF SB ELEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN THING BANG THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS SHARON RILEY ON BEHALF OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL IS PLEASED TO SUPPORT SB ELEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN AND THINKS THE SENATOR AND HIS STAFF FOR WORKING. WITH THE COUNCIL ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE COMMITTEE WELL KNOWS AND AND WE'VE ALREADY HEARD INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL OR AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM CURRENTLY THE SYSTEM IS OVERBURDENED AND THERE SIMPLY ARE NOT ENOUGH BEDS. TO BE AVAILABLE TO TREAT THESE INDIVIDUALS WE BELIEVE THE COUNCIL BELIEVES THAT S. B. ELEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN WILL HELP RELIEVE PRESSURE ON THE SYSTEM. BY OUR REDUCING WORK BURDENS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE OCCUR DURING THE THIRD YEAR OF RESTORATION --% CALLED FOUR IN CURRENT LAW THIS IN TURNS FREES UP RESOURCES ATTENDED A TO ATTEND TO THE NEEDS OF THESE INDIVIDUALS INCLUDING. FADS AND FREEZE UP SUPPORT -- TO DEAL WITH THE THESE INDIVIDUALS IN A MORE TIMELY MANNER HAPPY TO PROVIDE SPECIFICS ABOUT EXACTLY WHY WE THINK IT'LL REALLY PRESSURE ON THE COURTS OF THE COMMITTEE -- IS INTERESTED AND THEN FINALLY AS THOUGH LARA ARNOLD JUST STATED THE COUNCIL AGREES THAT S. B. ELEVEN SIX EIGHTY SEVEN IS CONSISTENT WITH THE CURRENT. VIEW VIEWS OF MENTAL HEALTH NEUROSCIENCE PROFESSIONAL. IT'S THAT IT IS LIKE UNLIKELY THAT AN INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS BEEN FOUND AYE AS T. WILL RE RESTORED COMPETENCY AFTER  PERIOD. OF TWO YEARS. THAT'S MAKING THE COURT PROCEEDINGS IN THE THIRD YEAR UNNECESSARY BECAUSE THEY DO NOT SUPPORT THE GOAL. RESTORATION TO COMPETENCY FOR THESE REASONS WE THE COUNCIL WOULD URGE YOUR I'VE YOU TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THINK YOU THANK YOU OR ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES NOT POSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I YOU MAY CLOSE ARE MISSED CHAIRMAN -- THE MOTIVATION FOR THIS BILL FROM MY STANDPOINT CAME -- ONE I VISITED A TRUSTED HERO HOSPITAL AND SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY I OF AS YOU KNOW I'VE VISITED LE TAKE UP.

ELEVEN HUNDRED WHICH PROBE PROHIBIT THE SALE OF FIREARMS BY LICENSED DEALER TO ANY PERSON BELOW THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE WELL HANDGUNS ARE USED IN THE MAJORITY OF GUN DEATHS. LONG GUNS HAVE BEEN USED TO PERPETUATE MANY OF THE LARGEST MASS SHOOTINGS IN CALIFORNIA. INCLUDING THE TRAGIC EVENTS THAT TOOK PLACE IN SAN BERNARDINO. CALIFORNIA IS HOME. TO SOME OF THE MOST STRINGENT GUN LAWS IN THE COUNTRY ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS IS REQUIRING INDIVIDUAL THE B. TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE IN ORDER TO PURCHASE A HANDGUN. SINCE CALIFORNIA STRIX GUN LAWS HAVE TAKEN AFFECTION DATA SHOWS THAT THERE'S BEEN A SUCCESSFUL REDUCTION IN THE INCIDENCE OF GUN TRAFFICKING. ONE NOT BURDENING LEGITIMATE GUN OWNERS ARE PERSONS WHO WISH TO ACQUIRE GUNS. IN ORDER TO BE YOU UNIFORMLY CONSISTENT CALIFORNIA SHOULD APPLY THE TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD AGE LIMIT. TO LONG GUNS. OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS CALIFORNIANS HAVE TYPICALLY PURCHASE MORE LONG GUNS THAN HANDGUNS -- FIFTEEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE LONG GUNS WERE PURCHASED BY PERSONS AGED. EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ALONE OF THE TWENTY SIX THOUSAND GUNS USED IN CRIMES THAT WERE ENTERED INTO CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AUTOMATED FIREARM SYSTEM DATABASE. ELEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED WERE LONG GUNS. THIS BILL WOULD EXEMPT CERTAIN GROUPS OF PEOPLE SUCH AS LICENSED HUNTERS MILITARY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. PREVENTING THE FLOW OF GUNS IS IMPORTANT PUBLIC SAFETY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE FIREARM AS A HANDGUN. OR LONG GONE OR PURCHASE NEW FROM A DEALER OR THROUGH A PRIVATE PARTY TRANSACTION -- I HAVE AMANDA WILCOX FROM THE BRADY CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF ELEVEN HUNDRED AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING AGAIN -- AMANDA WILCOX ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTERS OF THE BRADY CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE -- THE BRADY CAMPAIGN GENERALLY BELIEVES THAT HANDGUNS AND LONG GUNS SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME LAWS -- BACK YEARS AGO. I'VE THAT LONG GUNS WERE PRIMARILY OF RIFLES ARE NOT THE GRANDFATHER SHOTGUN LOCKED IN THE CLOSET -- AND THEY WEREN'T TREATED THE SAME BUT NOW THEM SO CALLED MODERN PACE SPORTING RIFLE. IS A HIGH POWERED CAN BE A HIGH POWERED SEMI AUTOMATIC WITH EXCHANGEABLE MAGAZINE ODD THAT IS OR CAN BE MORE LETHAL MORE THREATENING -- THAN A HANDGUN SO THERE'S NO WE SUBJECT TO THE SAME LAWS THIS BILL VOTE DOES NOT ACTUALLY ARE SUBJECT LONG GUNS AND HANDGUNS TO THE SAME LAW IT JUST PROHIBITS THE PURCHASE OF A LONG GONE. BY SOMEONE AGE TWENTY ONE IT DOES NOT PROHIBIT POSSESSION AND AS YOU HEARD ON THE PROVIDES A NUMBER OF EXCEPTIONS. I'D ALLOWS FOR INTRA FAMILIAL SALE OR TRANSFER OF A FIREARM SO THAT THROUGH DICK TRADITION OF A FATHER GIVING HIS SON HIS HUNTING GUN CAN CONTINUE -- AT THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JUST LAST WEEK I ISSUED A STATEMENT ARE REGARDING FIREARM -- GUM BINDS PREVENTION POLICIES THAT THEY'RE NOW SUPPORTING AND AMONG THOSE POLICIES THEY ARE NOW SUPPORTING BANNING POSSESSION AND USE OF FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION BY UNSUPERVISED YOUTH UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE AND SUPPORT BANNING THE SALES OF FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION. FROM LICENSE AN UNLICENSED DEALERS TO THOSE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE EXCLUDING CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF INDIVIDUALS SUCH AS MILITARY LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND I BELIEVE OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION -- IS ADOPTING THOSE POLICIES BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE AS TO WHY. THAT -- MATURITY IMPULSIVE AND RECKLESS BEHAVIOR AND RESPONSIBILITY VARY GREATLY AMONG EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY ONE YEAR OLDS -- FOR THAT THAT THEYARE DISPROPORTIONATELY LINKED TO CRIME AND FIREARM HOMICIDES SO IT MAKES COULD IT'S COMMON SENSE AND IT CERTAINLY GOOD PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY -- TO RAISE THE MINIMUM AGE FOR PURCHASE.

YOU DO NOT HAVE THAT SAME EXACT RIGHT TO YOUR OWN HOME -- AYE I WOULD HAPPEN TO AGREE WITH -- WITH ONE POINT THOUGH. WE BELIEVE THAT YES FIREARMS LONG GUNS AND HANDGUNS DO NEED TO BE TREATED THE SAME AND THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO OWN THEM. EVEN AT THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW INDIVIDUALS TO BE TO BE ADULTS TO BE CITIZENS AND HAVE FULL ACCESS TO THE RIGHTS THEREOF. OR WE'RE GOING TO SAY THAT AT THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE YOU ARE NOT AN ADULT AND THEREFORE YOU DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO ALL OF THE RIGHTS. THEIR OF EITHER WAY WE NEED TO MAKE A DECISION I THINK THAT YOU'RE A GROWN UP AN ADULT IN THE CITIZEN AND YOU HAVE RIGHTS. OR YOU DO NOT FOR THESE REASONS THAT WE OPPOSE THIS MEASURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SEPARATE IS REPRESENTING GOMEZ CALIFORNIA TWO POINTS NUMBER ONE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RECOGNIZES ANYBODY OVER THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN AS A MEMBER OF THE MILITIA.

SCHOOL HEARING ABOUT. THE LEADER SHOOTING THAT'S HAPPENED IN THE COUNTRY WITHOUT JUST A SENSE OF ABSOLUTE AND PERVASIVE FEAR. IT EXISTS EVERY SINGLE TIME WE WALKED SEUSS'S ON TO CAMPUS EVERY SINGLE TIME WE WALK INTO OUR CLASSROOMS. IT'S THE IDEA OF GUNS AND KNOWING THAT GUNS ARE BEING OPENLY SOLD IN THE AREA AND THAT -- PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO GUNS ARE BEING SOLD AT THE COW PALACE THAT THERE'S AN ACTIVE PROMOTION AND TOUTING OF THE IDEA THAT. GUNS ARE JUST THIS RIGHT THAT EVERYBODY HIGHS AND IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO WALK ON THE CAMPUS WITH A GUN THEY CAN EASILY GET IT.

WELL CLEAN IS LAGGING I'M VICE PRESIDENT OF CHECHNYA HIGH SCHOOL DISHING ON BEHALF OF MY BOARD AND I STUDENTS WE SUPPORT THANK YOU. OUR ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LOUIE BROWN ON BEHALF OF WESTERN FAIRS ASSOCIATION HOW WE REPRESENT. ALL THE SEVENTY EIGHT FAIRGROUNDS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA INCLUDING THE COW PALACE -- THIS IS A STATE OWNED FACILITY AS A HAS BEEN DISCUSSED IT IS ALSO OVERSEEN IN GOVERNED BY A BOARD OF DIRECTORS THAT ARE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR. ONE OF THEIR MAIN RESPONSIBILITY IS THE UPKEEP AND MAINTENANCE OF THIS FACILITY WHICH IS DONE BY REVENUES FROM THE SHOWS. AND THE RENTALS THAT TAKE PLACE AT THE COW PALACE WHICH DOES INCLUDE GUN SHOWS -- WE WE OPPOSE THIS BILL A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN CENTER LENO BROUGHT IT -- FOR VERY SIMILAR PURPOSES AT THAT TIME THE STATE WAS ACTUALLY I HAD INVESTING ABOUT THIRTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR INTO THE ENTIRE NETWORK AFFAIRS. SINCE THAT TIME -- MOST OF THAT MONEY HAS GONE AWAY -- LEAVING THE DID ASIANS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WITH THAT RESPONSIBILITY OF GENERATING THE REVENUE NECESSARY TO KEEP THEIR DOORS OPEN. AND AT THE SAME TIME NOT ONLY COVERING OPERATING EXPENSES -- BUTTON DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND NEEDS MOST FAIRGROUND IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALSO SERVICE EMERGENCY CENTERS. A DURING DISASTERS THE CAL PALACE AS AN EXAMPLE EYES FACING THE SITUATION WITH A ROOF THAT SEVERELY NEEDS REPAIR TO THE TUNE OF ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS INCLUDING OTHER DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THAT THEY HAVE. THE STATE COMING IN AND TELLING THEM WHAT THEY CAN AND CANNOT DO IN TERMS OF REVENUE JUST SIMPLY TIES THE HANDS OF THAT BOARD OF DIRECTORS EVEN MORE THAN THEY HAVE RIGHT NOW. THIS IS IN OUR MIND NECESSARILY ABOUT GUN SHOWS ARE NOT. THIS IS ABOUT REVENUE FOR A STATE OWNED FACILITY THAT RECEIVES LITTLE TO NO ASSISTANCE FROM THE STATE SO THAT IT CAN EXIST TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES THAT. IT HAS UNDER STATUTE AND SO. WE'RE HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT THESE TYPES OF SITUATIONS BUT IF THE LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO MOVE FORWARD AND START TO DICTATE WHAT CAN AND CANNOT HAPPEN ON A STATE OWNED FACILITY. THEN WE WOULD ASK THAT THEY AT THE SAME TIME COME FORWARD WITH THE NECESSARY FUNDING. THAT REPLACES THOSE DOLLARS SO THAT THESE BUILDINGS THESE FACILITIES CAN CONTINUE TO EXIST OTHERWISE YOU PUT THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS A VERY DIFFICULT POSITION. OF OF BEING. BEEN CONSTRAINED ON WHAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY DO TO KEEP THESE FACILITIES OPEN THEREFORE WERE OPPOSED AT THIS TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN NOT CAPULETS REPRESENTING CROSSROADS OF THE WEST -- WE WORKED -- GOING BACK TO NINETEEN NINETY NINE WAS SENATOR CORBETT ON LANDMARK LEGISLATION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA REGULATING GUN SHOWS IT IT TODAY IS. CONSIDERED REALLY THE PRIDE OF THE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF GUN SHOW MANAGEMENT I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT THERE HAVEN'T BEEN INCIDENTS AT GUN SHOWS IN CALIFORNIA. THE COW PALACE FACILITY ON WITH THE SHOW ON EXISTS BRINGS IN NUMBER SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY -- IN AND OUT YEAR SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS -- FOR THE SHOW THAT. YOU KNOW ALL THE ADDED COSTS OF CONCESSIONS AND OTHER THINGS I MIGHT POINT NOW -- I THINK IT'S A MISNOMER TO SUGGEST THAT YOU WALK INTO A GUN SHOW WALK OUT WITH A GUN -- BAIT BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE MADE SURE OF WHEN WE PASSED THE ORIGINAL STATUTE WAS THAT YOU COMPLY WITH ALL THE LAWS OF CALIFORNIA SO WE HAVE WAITING PERIODS IN CALIFORNIA SO. OF FIREARMS DO NOT GONNA. TO OUT THE SHOW PER SE YOU MAY START A WAITING PERIOD BUT YOU CANNOT COMPLETE THE TRANSACTION THERE SO ALL THE LAWS ARE COMPLIED WITH. THE SHOWS OPERATE ON THE WEEKEND WHEN SCHOOLS ARE NOT IN SESSION AND WE WOULD ALSO ARGUE THAT THIS IS REALLY A FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUE AS WELL THIS OF STATE OWNED PROPERTIES. WHERE LEGAL ACTIVITIES GO ON -- WENT CENTER LENO CARRIED THE BILL I KNOW WE HAD A VERY -- INTERACTIVE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES THAT GO ON AT THE COW PALACE ON AND IT'S VERY DIVERSE AND WE CERTAINLY SUPPORT THAT BUT IF TAXPAYERS DOLLARS ARE GOING TO BE INVOLVED AND ALL LEGAL ACTIVITIES SHOULD BE AUTHORIZED IF THEY'RE COMPLYING. WITH THE LAWS OF THE FACILITY. WOULD ALSO SAY UP LASTLY THAT UC DAVIS -- CONDUCTED A STUDY ON GUN SHOWS IN CALIFORNIA -- KAREN WHEN A MUTE WHO IS SPONSORED SECOND AMENDMENT PER SE. BUT FOUND THAT THE GUN SHOWS IN CALIFORNIA WERE ACTUALLY BY HIS DEFINITION BORING BECAUSE THEY THEY WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW AND THAT THE WERE NOT ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES GOING ON SO WE WE OPPOSE THIS BILL. AND THINK TIME IS BETTER SPENT ON SOME OF THE SCHOOL SAFETY MAJORS THAT ARE MOVING THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU OR ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION MAN ORGANIZATION. A CRADLE LOSE ABOUT THE FIREARMS POLICY COALITION -- IN OPPOSITION IF I IF I MIGHT JUST HAVE JUST. ONE MORE WORK GO OUT WHEN I THINK THAT WOULD NOTE IS IS THAT IT'S ALREADY BEEN NOTED BY BOTH THE AUTHOR AND BY ONE OF THE PEOPLE TESTIFYING THAT YOU OF LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES ARE BASICALLY SAYING. WE'RE GOING TO DENY YOU THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT YOU CAN OWN A GUN YOU JUST CAN'T. PURCHASE A GUN AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO LIMIT THE ONLY ABILITY THE ONLY WAY IN WHICH SOMEONE CAN OBTAIN WILL BE ABLE TO FACILITATE OR EXERCISE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. WITHIN THAT WITHIN THIS PARTICULAR AREA -- WE SEE THIS AS A MAJOR PROBLEM THEREFORE WE OPPOSE THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SAMPRAS OF REPRESENT GUNS CALIFORNIA ENABLE ORGANIZATION. AND A BIG PORTION I'M JUST STATING OR REPRESENTING. SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE THIRTY NINE POINT EIGHT A MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE RESIDENTS AND OWNERS OF THE CAL PALACE IN STRONG OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU SAM.

ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISTER QUIRK -- SO MY MY CONCERN AND THE REASON WHY WON'T BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL. IS THAT I JUST FEEL THAT THIS ARM. THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE ALL THE LAWS ARE OBSERVED -- AND IF PEOPLE DON'T BUY A GUN HERE I'M WORRIED THAT THEY WILL BUY A GUN IN THE PLACE WHERE ALL THOSE LAWS AREN'T OBSERVED. I SUPPORTED DAD DECRIMINALIZATION OF DRUGS OF PROSTITUTION. ARE AT CENTER AND THIS TO ME IS YOU NOW WE OUGHT TO HAVE THINGS IN THE OPEN. WHERE THE CONTROL TO NOT ALLOW THEM TO GO UNDERGROUND AND I'M CONCERNED THAT BY? UP PROHIBITING. A SITUATION WHERE ALL THE LAWS ARE OBSERVED WHERE EVERYTHING IS TAKEN CARE OF THE THINGS GO UNDERGROUND AND I JUST CAN'T SUPPORT THAT [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. UP IN NEW MAKE [inaudible] GOOD. OUR THANK YOU VERY MUCH AYE MR CHAIRMAN AND I DO WHAT IS NOTE THAT -- BECAUSE THERE WAS A NUMBER THROWN OUT BEFORE ABOUT -- REVENUE BY THE KELP PALACE HAS TOLD US THAT THEIR ANNUAL REVENUE FROM THE GUN SHOWS IS SOMEWHERE. IN THE 1-002-002-5000 DOLLAR RANGE THAT'S OUT OF FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE SO IT IS SOMETHING I'M NOT DISMISSING THA NUMBER BUT IT IS A TINY PERCENTAGE OF A CAL PALACES -- I AM I AM CONFIDENT THEY CAN MAKE THAT OUT I WILL ALSO SAY THAT -- THE COW PALACE HAS OWNS A LOT OF LANDS AND OTHER CITY OF DALY CITY FOR YEARS HAS BEEN TRYING TO WORK WITH THE CAL PALACE. ONE SOME REDEVELOPMENT OF THAT LAND THAT'S NOT REALLY BEING USED FOR VERY MUCH -- RIGHT NOW -- TO TRY TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITY THERE ARE MANY REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE KALPOE US -- AND I KNOW THAT -- ASSEMBLYMAN -- TING MY CO AUTHOR AND I ARE IN CONVERSATION WITH THEM WE WANT TO BE HELPFUL IN FACILITATING. AYE THOSE CONVERSATIONS YOU KNOW ARE IN THE AND THIS IS ABOUT -- LOCAL COMMUNITIES HAVING THE ABILITY -- TO TO PROTECT THEMSELVES TO PROTECT OUR STUDENTS AND OUR THAT THEY CAN'T DO THAT HERE SO WE NEED TO DO IT FOR THEM AND I RESPECT. AWESOME AND QUIRKS ARE CONCERNED I I I DON'T THINK THAT ELIMINATING A ONE GUN SHOW -- IN ONE LOCATION IS GONNA -- BECAUSE THAT THAT HAPPENED BUT I COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE [inaudible] BIG. NEED A MOTION AND A SECOND. OKAY OF SO I I SOME NEW SUPPORT IT BASED ON ON THE FOLLOWING -- WE WENT TO A LONG DRAWN OUT ON DISCUSSION. MEMBERS TO CORP REMINDING ME ABOUT BUT CANNABIS. AND ONE OF THE REMAIN LYNCH PINS TO GETTING IT APPROVED AND AUTHORIZED OR LEGALIZE WHATEVER. YOU WANT TO CALL IT MEDICAL AND DON'T USE. SO DISCUSSION ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL [inaudible] AND I THINK A LOT OF US VOTED FOR IT BECAUSE HE WANTED ALLOW LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES WHERE CITY OR COUNTY. TO MAKE THE DECISION. ARM WHAT GOES ON INNER CITY. I'M HEARING FROM YOU THAT BOTH THE LOCAL ENTITIES -- WANT TO PROHIBIT -- MEANS A LOT EXPECTS FREMONT FROM LOS ANGELES THE CONVENTION CENTER IN LOS ANGELES HIS OWN. BY CITY LOS ANGELES AND I DON'T BELIEVE I'LL DOUBLE CHECK. THAT. AND I PROBABLY WILL GET CORRECTED IF I'M WRONG -- BUT WE'LL HAVE A WHOLE LOT A GUN SHOWS IF I DON'T THINK WE HAVE IT. AND IF WE DON'T IS BECAUSE THE CITY COUNCIL ITS DECIDED. THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY -- GUN SHOOTS GUN SHOWS IF WE DIDN'T PASS I'M PRETTY SURE. BY BE SPEAKING NOW THE MACE THEY MAY STOP IT IN THE FUTURE A THAT AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO LISTEN TO THE LOCAL PEOPLE THIS IS A UNIQUE SITUATION WHERE THE STATE OWNED SOMETHING.

HOT THERE ARE THIS IS ONE PIECE OF A BROADER ISSUE -- WITH -- TRANS AM CAR THOSE WHO ARE -- TREATED. VERY POORLY I'M NOT AT ALL SITUATION BUT IN MANY SITUATIONS ARE WHO ARE NOT THIS IS FUNDAMENTALLY CAUSED BY. PARTICULARLY TRANS WOMEN WHO ARE BEING CLASSIFIED AND HOW THOSE -- WITH MEN AND SO THEY ARE THERE FOR AT SIGNIFICANT RISK OF ASSAULT SEXUAL SAW AND SO THEM PLACED IN ISOLATION. I YOU KNOW QUOTE UNQUOTE FOR THEIR OWN PROTECTION WHICH MAY LEAD TO THIS ISSUE OF BEING DEPRIVED OF SERVICES.

TO THANK YOU FOR THAT. OKAY THANK YOU I TAKE DAYS YOUR CLOTHES MEN'S TERRY. CALLED WORLD. JEREC MANY AND I S. B. NINE NINETY THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER AYE AYE DENSER AYE LACKEY. LACKEY NO CARDIO CARDIO I KAMLAGER-DOVE. KAMLAGER-DOVE AYE KILEY. KILEY NOT BOATING QUIRK. QUIRK AYE SANTIAGO. THAT MEASURE PASSES BETTER MUCH CONSIDER [inaudible] NOT VOTING. LACKEY NOTED NOT VOTING SENATE HUESO. S. B. ELEVEN SIXTY ITEM NUMBER. NINE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS YEAH YOU'RE. THE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THANK YOU SIR. I'M PROUD TO PRESENT SB ELEVEN SIXTY THIS IS. A VERY IMPORTANT BILL. THAT WOULD ADD TO THE SECURITY IN THE ENJOYMENT OF GAMING FACILITY PATRONS AND EMPLOYEES STATEWIDE. THIS BILL PASSED OUT OF THE SENATE WITH HER STRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND NO NO VOTE -- TRESPASSING. AT GAMING FACILITIES IS THE CONTINUED PROBLEM AND POSES. A SERIOUS THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY. ONLY INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE A PUBLIC THREAT ARE ISSUED AN ORDER OF EXCLUSION. SUCH ACTIVITY INCLUDES INTOXICATION COUNTERFEITING HARASSMENT THEFT AND OTHERS. IN THAT CATEGORY. BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S A PUBLIC LAW TWO EIGHTY STATE. AND THAT MEANS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GIVES A STATE AUTHORITY. THAT ITS TO SCRATCH AT THE DISCRETION OF LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO ENFORCE THE EXCLUSION ORDERS ORIGINATING WITH THEN [inaudible] TRIBAL LANDS -- THAT AND THIS EXTENDS TO THE TRIBAL GAMING EX. ESTABLISHMENT IT'S UP TO STATE LAW. WHETHER TO DETERMINE. WHETHER LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN. UP HOLD -- LAWS WITHIN. TRIBAL LANDS SO THIS BILL ACCORDING TO THAT SPECIFIC POLICY IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO ENSURE. THAT TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS CAN WORK LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES TO UPHOLD THE LAW. WE ALREADY GET HAVE OTHER ESTABLISHMENTS US SPECIFIC LETTER OF THE LAW AUTHORITY TO WORK WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ENFORCE EXCLUSION ORDERS. AND THIS BILL IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY IN ORDER FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT CHU CHU ENFORCE EXCLUSION ORDERS. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE SOME. ALONG FORSMAN AGENCIES IN SOME COUNTIES IN THE STATE. THAT ALREADY -- ENFORCE EXCLUSION ORDERS BUT THAT IS KIND OF A BIGGER AREA AND THE LAW THAT POTENTIALLY EXPOSES. THESE -- OF THESE -- AGENCIES TO A CHALLENGE A LEGAL CHALLENGE TO REALLY CHECK TEST. WHETHER THE LAW PERMITS THAT CURRENTLY. THE ONLY WAY THE TRIBES HAVE -- TO HAVE THEIR EXCLUSION ORDERS ENFORCED IS TO GO TO A STATE COURT. AND SEEK A RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST THE MOST PROBLEMATIC PERSON. THIS CAN TAKE. MONTHS IF NOT YEARS. BUT IT'S A VERY COSTLY AND DIFFICULT PROGRAM. AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT THE TRIBES HAVE NECESSARILY. FOUGHT RELIED ON TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN -- IF FORCED THEIR EXCLUSION ORDER. S. B. ELEVEN SIXTY THIS BILL BEFORE US WOULD CODIFY THE ABIITY A LOCAL ON LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO ENFORCE TRIBAL EXCUSED EXCLUSION ORDERS LIMITED TO TRIBAL TRIBAL GAMING FACILITIES. INDIVIDUALS PLACED ON ON EXCLUSION LIST WOULD HAVE DUE PROCESS INCLUDING NOTICE AND A HEARING BEFORE THE TRIBAL GAMING COMMISSION. THIS IS THE THE SAME AUTHORITY AS I MENTIONED EARLY GIVEN TO CARD ROOMS AT HORSE RACING TRACKS. IN CALIFORNIA UNDER CALIFORNIA BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE SECTIONS ONE NINE EIGHT ZERO ONE AND ONE NINE NINE FOUR ZERO TRYING WERE GAVE ME SHOULD BE TREATED. NO DIFFERENTLY. AGAIN IN MANY PARTS OF THE STATE TRIBAL. EXCLUSIONS ARE NOT ENFORCED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS TAKEN THE POSITION THAT THEY CAN NOT. THAT THE STATE DOES NOT PROVIDE THEM THE AUTHORITY TO DO SO AND THIS BILL WOULD CORRECT THAT AND REQUIRE THEM. CHU CHU UP FOLLOW THE LAW. S. B. WOULD ALIGN ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH THE CLEAR AND CONSISTENT PROCESS FOR ENFORCING ORDERS OF EXCLUSIONS. ISSUED BY TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY WOULD NOT BE WEEKEND IN ANY WAY. IN FACT SB ELEVEN SIXTY WOULD STRENGTHEN IT BY ALLOWING TRUCK TRIBAL GAMING AUTHORITIES TO EXCLUDE DANGEROUS PERSONS AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND WOULD GIVE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT THE ABILITY TO FOR SUCH AN EXCLUSION THIS WOULD BE EXTENDING A VERY NECESSARY AND IMPORTANT SERVICE. CHIU TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS WITHOUT HAVING TO SEEK COURT A APPROVAL PRIOR TO A TO THAT PROCESS. WE HAVE WITH WITH US TODAY I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE STEVE STALIN. STALIN'S HE'S -- THE CHAIRMAN OF CIGNA STEVE HARTLEY TRIBAL ATTORNEY IN MICHAEL STILL THE ASSISTANT DE. DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR SAMUEL COUNTY -- IF BUT WHAT THE CHAIRMAN'S A PERMISSION IF THEY COULD PROVIDE SOME COMMENTS AS TO WAI THE SKILLS NEEDED YES TO USUALLY PROVIDE FIVE MINUTES FOR EVERYONE TOTALITY SO. HOW HOW YOU WANT TO BREAK IT UP? GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS STEVE STALLINGS ON THE CHAIRMAN THE CALIFORNIA NATION'S INDIAN GAMING ASSOCIATION. NOT A SPONSOR OF SB ELEVEN SIXTY BY WITH OUR THIRTY SIX MEMBERS ARE TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS. WE REPRESENT THE LARGEST REGIONAL ASSOCIATION OF TRIBES IN THE UNITED STATES. EDITION TO THE ASSOCIATION SUPPORT HAVE YOU LOOK AT OUR SUPPORT LESS YOU'LL SEE TWO MAJOR TRIBAL ASSOCIATIONS IN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THAT REPRESENT ANOTHER THIRTY TRIBES. S. B. ELEVEN SIXTY WILL ENHANCE THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF CASINO PATRONS AND OUR EMPLOYEES STATEWIDE. TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS WORK HARD TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE OR IS STRONG SAFETY IN OUR FACILITIES. FOUND IN OUR GAMING ESTABLISHMENTS -- ACTUALLY. THE FOR SOME OF THE MAJOR PROBLEMS YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HERE THIS MORNING. HOWEVER SINCE THEY ARE CALIFORNIA'S A PUBLIC LAW TWO EIGHTY STATE. TRIES MUST RELY UPON LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE COURTS AFTER THOSE GUILTY OF TRESPASSING IN OUR FACILITIES. CURRENTLY ENFORCEMENTOF TRESPASS LACKEY STATEWIDE STANDARD OF FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT THE FOLLOWING. NOW THIS CREATES ONE BY ADDING A TRY WORKS [inaudible] GOVERNMENT -- TO EXISTING DEFINITIONS OF CRIMINAL TRESPASS SO WE'RE NOT CREATING A NEW LAW -- WERE JUST ADDING TRIBES -- AND MAKING IT CLEAR THAT THEY HAVE THE GUARANTEE THAT OTHER FACILITIES HAVE NOW FOR THE SAME LAW ENFORCEMENT PROTECTIONS AS OTHER CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES.-IS A FALLACY TO STATE THIS AMENDMENT TO THE PENAL CODE IS NOT NECESSARY. IF THAT WAS TRUE THE CARD ROOMS AND RACE TRACKS WOULD HAVE HAD THEIR HAVE TO HAVE THEIR AMENDMENT TO THE BUSY PROFESSIONAL COACH -- IT'S SIMPLY ARE ABOUT PATRON EMPLOYEE PROTECTION TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS ISSUE EXCLUSION ORDERS WHEN INDIVIDUALS POSE A RISK TO THE PUBLIC. OTHER FOR FOR PROFIT GAMING ESTABLISHMENTS CAN DO THIS ALREADY. TRIBAL CASINO PATRONS AND EMPLOYEES DESERVE THE SAME PROTECTION. NONSENSE PATRONS ARE ANY CASINO EMPLOYEES ARE OVERWHELMING FROM OUTSIDE OUR COMMUNITIES IS A PROBLEM AFFECTS A WIDE VARIETY OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS -- TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS GUARANTEES A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND PATRONS EMPLOYEES CAN HAVE A CLEAR PROCESS FOR REMOVAL EXCLUSION AND CHARGING THOSE PERSONS OPPOSE A DANGER. SO WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOUR SUPPORT. FOR THIS LEGISLATION BEFORE ARE ANY MAJOR INCIDENTS TO HAPPEN OUR FACILITIES. THANK YOU. MIX. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS MIKE STILL THE W. DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO BEEN A PROSECUTOR FOR TWENTY SIX YEARS. ON THE TRIBAL LAYS ON FOR THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF SEND YOUR COUNTY -- AND I ADVISE HER AND WORK WITH. THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT ON TRIBAL GAMING IT NEEDS ARE PRETTY ISSUES SEND YOU COUNTY IS THE MOST DRIVE ANY COUNTY THE WHOLE COUNTRY EIGHTEEN A TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS. AND THE MOST INDIAN CASINOS OF ANY COUNTY IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY CURRENTLY. ELEVEN BECAUSE HE WAS ATTRACT PROBLEM PATRONS THAT'S NO SECRET. THEY POSE A THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY VIGIL TO CHEAT STEAL HARASS OTHER PATRONS BECOME INTOXICATED TRY TO PASS THAT JACKSON YOU STOLEN CREDIT CARDS. THERE'S ALSO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROSTITUTION AND DRUG DEALING. TRIBAL GAMING COMMISSION'S COMPLACENT PERSONS ON EXCLUDED HER BAND LIST -- AND KEEP THEM OUT THE CASINO -- STRONG SECURITY AND SURVEILLANCE AT THE CASINOS LETS THEM IDENTIFY THESE INDIVIDUALS WHEN THEY COME BACK UNDER CALIFORNIA. TRUSTS PASSED LAWS WHEN THAT EXCLUDE PERSON COMES BACK IN ORDER FOR THERE TO BE A TRUST PASS. THAT PERSON HAS TO BE INTERFERE WITH THE BUSINESS AND OTHER WORDS DOING SOMETHING THEY SHOULDN'T BE DOING ALL OVER AGAIN. AND REFUSED TO LEAVE WHEN ASKED TO DO SO BY CASINO SECURITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. WHY SHOULD THE CASINO PERSONNEL HAVE TO WAIT FOR THIS EXCLUDED PERSON WHO'S ALREADY BEEN THERE BECAUSE A PROBLEM BECAUSE THE PROBLEM ALL OVER AGAIN -- THE CURRENT CALIFORNIA CRIMINAL TRESPASS LA DOES NOT ADEQUATELY ADDRESS AND PREVENT THIS REOCCURRING REOCCURRING PROBLEM ENCOUNTERED ANY CASINOS AS EXAMPLE JUST LAST WEEK. WE HAD AN INDIVIDUAL PLACING A VIDEO CAMERA AND A WOMEN'S BATHROOM AT ANY CASINO IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY. ON A PRIOR OCCASION THIS INDIVIDUAL HAD BEEN SEEN HARASSING WOMEN THEY CONCEAL AND HAD BEEN ESCORTED FROM THE CASINO AND PLACED ON THE BAND ARE EXCLUDED LIST BY THE GAMING COMMISSION. ON THIS OCCASION CASINO SURVEILLANCE PICKED THEM UP AGAIN ANTS CASINO SECURITY FOLLOWED HIM INTO THE WOMEN'S RESTROOM WHERE HE WAS HE TRYING TO CONCEAL THE VIDEO RECORDER UNDER ONE OF THE STALLS. Y. TICKETS YOU KNOW SECURITY HAVE TO WAIT FOR THIS INDIVIDUAL TO DO THIS ALL OVER AGAIN SB ELEVEN SIXTY WOULD HAVE. HELPED US CLOSE THIS LOOPHOLE IN GIVE TRIBAL GAMING LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT LOCAL PROSECUTORS. THE ABILITY TO EXCLUDE REMOVE AND PROSECUTE THESE INDIVIDUALS. WHO HAVE PREVIOUSLY PREVIOUSLY CAUSE A PROBLEM IN THE CASINOS FROM TRESPASSING AND COMING BACK AGAIN? THIS IS THE SAME AUTHORITY GIVEN A CARD ROOMS A HORSE RACE TRACKS IN A CALIFORNIA BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE SECTION NINETEEN EIGHTY TO ONE IN. NINETEEN NINE FORTY CARDROOM HORSE RICKY HORSE RACE TRACK AMY COMMISSIONS OR BOARD CAN EXCLUDE. AYE INDIVIDUALS AND PLACE THEM ON A LIST IN OF THAT INDIVIDUAL COMES BACK IN VIOLATION THAT EXCLUSION ORDER. THERE'D BE PROSECUTED FOR CRIMINAL TRESPASS. TRIBAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TRIBAL PEACE AND SECURITY WORDS IS IN TROUBLE COURTS ARE UNABLE TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESSING CLOSES THE POLL AND CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW. A DEAL LACK OF JURISDICTIONAL AUTHORITY AND THE ABILITY OF LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ENFORCE TRIBAL EXCLUSION ORDERS. IS THE CATCH TWENTY TWO S. B. ELEVEN SIXTY WOULD CODIFY THE ABILITY OF LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO EXCLUDE TO ENFORCE TRIBAL SCREW THESE INDIVIDUALS FROM GAMING FACILITIES IN FAVOR OF PUBLIC SAFETY. INDIVIDUALS PLACE ON EXCLUSION LIST WOULD HAVE TO PROCESS INCLUDING NOTICED IN THE RIGHT TO A HEARING BEFORE THE TRIBAL GAMING COMMISSION. JUST LIKE THOSE INDIVIDUALS EXCLUDED FROM HORSE RACE TRACKS IN CARD ROOMS. TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY IS NOT WEAKENED BY THIS BILL ITS STRENGTH AND RIGHT NOW THE TRIBES HAVE TO GO TO STATE COURT RECEIVED A RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST THOSE INDIVIDUALS. THIS WILL ALLOW THE TRIBE LOW ALONG WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR USE W. TIME. THANK YOU ASKING FOR SUPPORT -- GIVE YOU THIRTY SECONDS OKAY MISTER CHAIRMAN BARRY BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF UNITE HERE WE HAVE A LITTLE SEPARATE ISSUE WERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL FIRST OF ALL.

ON SEE CONSISTENT WITH THE WAY IT'S DONE IN THE REST OF THE WORLD -- IN AMERICA ON TO DEAL WITH THE LABOR RELATIONS TRAVEL LABOR RELATIONS ORDINANCE IN TRIBAL LABOR RELATIONS RULES BUT FOR A WORKER UNION ORGANIZER WOULD BE SUBJECTED.

CHAIRMAN DRONE SCENE IS IN THE APP OF THE NIGHT AUBURN INDIAN COMEDIAN THE BLUE LAKE RANCHERIA AND SUPPORT [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MONICA THAT'S WHAT THE KITANA CRUISE COMPANY ON BEHALF OF THE VA HOSPITAL COMMUNITY INDIANS WE DEFINITELY NEED THE PROTECTION THAT THIS BILL PROVIDES RUN VERY STRONG SUPPORT.

ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION GENTLEMAN [inaudible] YES. I NEED ALL THREE CHAIRS MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS ON CAROLINE BILL HUNT TRUMP HAPPY YOUR TODAY HE WENT TO NATION. ON WE HEAR A TO OPPOSE THE BILL. AS NOTED BY THE AUTHORED ON THE FACT SHEET SB ELEVEN SIXTY WAS INTRODUCED TO PROVIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS WITH THE CLEAR AND CONSISTENT PROCESS. FOR HANDLING TRIBAL EXCLUSION ORDERS ON A STATEWIDE BASIS AS INTRODUCED YOUR TODAY HE WENT TO NATION FOUND THE STATED PURPOSE OF THE BILL TO BE LAUDABLE AND IS SUPPORTIVE OF EFFORTS TO CLARIFY A CONFIRM. TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS RIGHTS TO ARREST AND PROSECUTE INDIVIDUALS WHO ENTER PRIVATE LANDS WITHOUT TRIBAL CONSENT. THAT RIGHT IS ONE OF THE MORE FUNDAMENTAL POWERS OF INDIAN TRIBAL GOVERNMENT TO EXCLUDE UNWANTED PERSON FROM THEIR SOVEREIGN LANDS AND BUSINESSES. WHILE YOUR CHECK HAS A STRONG WORKING LIKE WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OUR TRIBAL COUNCIL UNDERSTANDS THAT NOT ALL TRIBES DO AND BELIEVES THAT EMBEDDING THESE PRINCIPLES IN CALIFORNIA LAW. TO PROVIDE UNIFORM AND FORCED IT IS A GOOD IDEA. WE TAKE EXCEPTION HOWEVER TO AN AMENDMENT INTRODUCED IN THE BILL THAT REVERSES THE STATED PURPOSE OF THE BILL. ON PAGES TEN STARTING AT LINE TWENTY NINE THE BILL STATES IN PERTINENT PART THAT. IF THE ORDER OF EXCLUSION PERTAINS TO A LABOR ORGANIZATION. THE TRIBE SO FIRST OBTAIN A DECISION FROM THE TRIBAL LABOR PANEL STATING THAT THE ORDERS OF EXCLUSION DOES NOT CONFLICT WITH THE TRIBAL LABOR RELATIONS ORDINANCE. IN ESSENCE ESTABLISHING THAT THE TRIBE MUST FIRST SEEK PERMISSION FROM A THIRD PARTY IN ACT IN ORDER TO EXERCISE ITS SOVEREIGN RIGHT. IT IS AT NEW ONCE TO YOUR TODAY HE TAKES EXCEPTION WITH. INQUIRIES HOW WE STATE LAW CAN SEEK TO AMEND THE SUBSTANCE OF THE TRIBAL LABOR RELATIONS ORDINANCE EMBEDDED IN THE TRIBAL STATE COMPACTS WHICH WERE NEGOTIATED BY THAT WITH THE GOVERNOR AND RATIFIED WITH A TWO THIRDS VOTE OF THE LEGISLATURE. AND APPROVED BY THE PARTNER OF INTERIOR. WHILE THE PREFERRED ACTION WOULD BE TO RETURN THE BILL TO ITS ORIGINAL FORM YOUR TODAY WE WEEK YESTERDAY HE WENT TO NATION HAVE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE AUTHOR. THAT HAVE THUS FAR BEEN REJECTED. THE AMENDMENTS EMBRACE THE USE OF THE TRIBAL. DIMINISH TRIBAL SOVEREIGN RIGHTS BY REQUIRING THAT THE TRIBE CONVINCE A THIRD PARTY THAT THEY HAVE THE POWER TO PROTECT THEIR LAND AND PROPERTIES. THAT TO A MINUTE THE PROS THE POSTMAN WOULD INSTEAD PUT THE ONUS ON THE NON TRIBAL ENTITY TO CONVINCE THE TRIBAL LABOR PANEL. THAT THE EXCLUSION ORDER WAS ISSUED A ROBUSTLY AND SOLELY TO OTHERWISE IS TO STOP OTHERWISE UNLAWFUL ACTIVITY. IN ABSENCE OF RETURN THE BILL TO ITS ORIGINAL FORM WE ASK THAT YOU ADOPT THESE AMENDMENTS AND WE MUST CONTINUE TO REMAIN OPPOSED IN ITS CURRENT FORM THANK YOU. BUT YES I BROUGHT UP YOU ARE NOT TAKING TIME HERE ON BEHALF OF THE BROADBAND OF MISSION INDIANS WE DO FIND OURSELVES IN AN UNFORTUNATE AN UNUSUAL POSITION HERE ON THIS BILL. IN THE SENSE THAT WE WERE EARLY SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL IN ITS EARLIER VERSIONS HOWEVER IT TOOK A WRONG TURN -- AS CAROLINE DESCRIBED WITH RESPECT TO THIS PROVISION WHERE YOU ARE ESSENTIALLY REQUIRING A TRIBE TO SEEK PERMISSION TO TAKE AN ACTION -- AND I WOULD ALSO JUST NOTE THAT IT IS AN UNUSUAL STANCE FOR US -- TO TAKEN OPPOSITION POSITION -- AGAINST -- AND AUTHOR THAT WE GENERALLY VERY MUCH RESPECTS. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THAT IS THE CASE IN THIS SITUATION SO AT THIS TIME WE WOULD ASK THAT THE COMMITTEE -- HOLD THE BILL AND THEN I WOULD ALSO ADD -- AND THAT AFTER THE BILL WAS PULLED LAST WEEK WE DID REACH OUT TO THE AUTHORS OFFICE TO TRY TO SEE IF THERE MIGHT BE A DIFFERENT WAY TO THREAD. THE NEEDLE -- ON THE LABOR PROVISION NICOLE AND WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD -- AND CLARIFYING APPROACH AND THAT WAS ESSENTIALLY I REJECTED OUT OF HAND -- WITHOUT MUCH DISCUSSION US SO AGAIN WE REGRET THAT WEARING AN OPPOSE POSITION AND URGE THE COMMITTEE TO STOP THE BILL THAT. THANK YOU SEPPALA TREAT ON BEHALF OF PECHANGA BATTLE A SENIOR MISSION INDIANS -- ECHOING THE REMARKS OF BOTH YOU KNOW CHEN AND VERONA -- THEIR HUNDRED NINE FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES IN STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALL OUR SOVEREIGN NATIONS -- SO NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH PUBLIC LAW TWO EIGHTY BUT AT THE SAME TIME AS A SOVEREIGN NATION -- WE IT'S VERY OBJECTIONABLE TO TO BOTH PECHANGA AND I THINK QUITE A FEW OTHER TRIBES. OUGHT NOT TO SIT DOWN IN THE CONSULTATION AND MAYBE ONE OF THE ALL TRIBES MEETINGS TO DISCUSS HOW THIS AFFECTS US -- THE IDEA OF OF REQUIRING TRIES TO OBTAIN A DECISION FROM A THIRD PARTY WHEN WE ARE GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT NEGOTIATING WITH THE GOVERNOR -- IS IS NOT RESPECTING SOVEREIGNTY AND WE WOULD ASK THAT THE COMMITTEE HOLD THE BELL WE WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH. VIA THE AUTHOR WHO'S BEEN A GOOD FRIEND INDIAN COUNTRY FOR MANY YEARS BUT THIS ISN'T COOKED YET. AND THE PARTIES INVOLVED IN THIS ARE THE OTHER TRIBES THAT ALSO NEED TO WAY AND OUT WHO DID SUPPORT THE BILL BEFORE THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OKAY ARE EIGHT ANY QUESTIONS. FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS YES [inaudible] GLENDALE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THINK YOU TO ALL THOSE THAT HAVE TESTIFIED TODAY INCLUDING THE AUTHOR BRING THIS -- TO TO OUR SIDE OF THE OF THE CHAMBER NOW. YOU KNOW I AM I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY. AND TO THE POINT THAT THERE OVER A HUNDRED NINE SOVEREIGN NATIONS IN OUR STATE AND ENSURING THAT. WE S. A LEGISLATIVE BODY ARE NOT IMPOSING ON WHAT TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY IS INCLUDING BOTH WITH DECISIONS ON LAW ENFORCEMENT AS WELL AS SESSIONS WITH LABOR WHICH WE WANT TO BE SUPPORTIVE UP BUT NOT QUITE SURE IF -- ALL PARTIES INVOLVED HAVE ACTUALLY SAT AT THE TABLE TOGETHER TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND AND TRY TO MOVE THIS FORWARD I WOULD WANT TO BE SUPPORTIVE BUT ALSO ONE UNDERSTAND. THE IMPACT THAT THIS HOUSE ON TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY AND NATIONS ACROSS OUR STATE. AND HOW BEST WE CAN DO SOMETHING THAT IS -- ACCEPTED ON ALL ON ALL LEVELS SO -- WOULD REALLY LIKE TO TO SEE HOW THESE CONVERSATIONS HAVE HAPPENED OR OCCURRED OR WHAT YOU PLAN ON DOING FORWARD TO ENSURE THAT. THE THE POSITIONS THAT WERE TAKEN BEFORE SUCH US SUPPORTING THE BILL AND NOW IN ITS AMENDED FORM NOT SUPPORTING THE BILL. AND WHAT THAT MEANS AND HOW WE CAN BEST INTERPRET THAT -- TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE ONE PROTECTING WORKERS AND PROTECTING THOSE SIDE. LIVE ON ON SOVEREIGN LAND. BUT THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH THE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY LIVE IN THESE COMMUNITIES. TO ENSURE THAT WHAT WE DO AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY IT'S HELPFUL. CAN I LETTERS LETTER STATEMENT I IT WAS OUR BEST CHEST MADE ALL CAPS ARE. GO AHEAD. AND NOT SIMPLY PUT I JUST WANT TO SAY THIS THIS BILL. HAS IS IS A CULMINATION OF OF TECH HAS DECADES OF WORK ON BEHALF OF THE TRIBE. ARE. THEY HAVE WORKED WITH THIS WITH THE TURN. FEDERAL LAW AS IT PERTAINS TO TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS VERY CLEARLY. MEAN THAT THERE'S A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE. AT TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS AND WITHOUT -- STATE APPROVAL MANY. TRAVEL ACTIVITIES ARE ARE LIMITED. AND AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE AREAS WHERE WE WE NEED. STATE INVOLVEMENT TO CLARIFY THE LAW OR TO PERMIT. AN ACTIVITY TO HAPPEN JUST LIKE WHEN YOU WHEN YOU SIGN A COMPACT JUST LIKE WHEN. YOU KNOW I I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH TRIBES -- FOR GOING ON FOURTEEN YEARS NOW. MAN I I SERVED AT A LOCAL COMMITTEE. WHERE ACTION WAS REQUIRED FOR US TO BE INVOLVED IN PLANNING AROUND TRIBES MAKING INVESTMENT TRIBE WHAT ROADWAY? WATER WAY WE HAVE WE HAVE BILLS EVERY YEAR THAT RELATE CHIU. OUT WATER DISTRICT ACCESS TO WATER HOW WE WE GOVERN OUR YOU KNOW AROUND. OUR OUR ACTIVITIES IN ND AROUND THE RESERVATIONS THERE THERE IS A YOU KNOW. THERE IS A REQUIREMENT THE STATE WORK WITH TRIBES AND MANY AREAS IN THERE'S A REQUIREMENT TRIES WORK WITH STATE. ON MANY AREAS AND THAT REQUIRES LEGISLATION -- WE HAVE EXPERTS THAT HAVE I LOOKED INTO THIS AND SAID. THAT WE NEED THIS TO ACCOMPLISH OUR ULTIMATE GOAL. WHEN WE TOOK THAT AMENDMENT THE SENATE? AND IT DID IT DIDN'T REGISTER AT THAT AT THAT LEVEL WHITE RACISTS ARE HERE IS IS. UNKNOWN TO ME [inaudible] BUT AT THE STATE LEVEL WE TOOK THAT AMENDMENT IT WAS CONSISTENT WITH ACTIONS THAT WE HAVE TAKEN ON COMPAQ'S. AND ARE THERE A <u>&lt;c.green&gt; TRIBES&lt;/c&gt;</u> OPPOSED. TWO AT SOME OF THE LANGUAGE AND COMPACT ABSOLUTELY THEY ARE. AND IT'S IT'S IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A IT'S NOT A SOVEREIGNTY ISSUE. IT'S MORE OF A DISAGREEMENT IN TERMS OF HOW [inaudible] A THEY SHOULD CONDUCT CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THEIR THEIR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. AND AND NONE THE LESS THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A CHALLENGE TO THAT. OTHER THAN A BALLOT INITIATIVE BACK AND BACK. AWHILE BACK THAT THE CHALLENGED. ARE THOSE BEING ADDED TO THE THE THE COMPACT WERE OVERTURNED BY THE PUBLIC. AND IT WAS. BUT ACTION THAT REQUIRED AGAIN A STATE LAW. SO I THINK FOR THE TRIBES MANY OF THEM THAT ALREADY HAVE THESE PROVISIONS IN THE COMPACT THEY SEE IT WE DON'T SEE THE HARM BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY. A STATE LAW. THIS BASICALLY REITERATES -- THE STATE LAW I THINK FOR IT FOR THIS BILL ADVANCE WE WE LOOKED AT AND SAID THERE ISN'T A HARM. BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY LAW THERE'S NO REASON THAT ADDING IT TO THIS PROVISION WOULD CREATE. A DOES A CREATOR REDUNDANT REDUNDANCY YES AT US I AGREE WITH THAT. BUT DOES THAT CREATE A CONFLICT NO IT DOESN'T. SO WE DON'T SEE HARM IN ADDING THAT. AND WE NEVER THOUGHT THAT IT BECOMES AN ISSUE. TO BE HONEST WITH YOU BECAUSE I MEAN THE TRIBES BASICALLY. ARE CONSULTED AND SAID -- IT'S NOT A PROBLEM WE SHOULD MOVE FORWARD THERE IS A AS YOU SEE A THREE TRIBES MAYBE. FOUR ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BUT THIS IS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HUNDRED NINE TRIBES IN CALIFORNIA. CHAU EVERY TRIED THIS IN OPPOSITION ACTUALLY HAS. THIS LABOR RELATIONS POUND THEIR CURRENT COMPACT. IT DOESN'T PROTECT EMPLOYEES WHO COMMIT THESE PETTY CRIMES BUT IT ONLY REALLY PROTECT THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE NORMALLY GOING THROUGH THEIR ORGANIZING ACTIVITIES. SO IT ALLOWS FOR NOTHING MORE THAT'S ALREADY AGREED TO BUY THOSE TRIBES IN THEIR COMPACTS. COME OUT OF THE OF COURSE WELL SCUD. I WAS SO -- THAT TOUCHES UPON SOMEONE I WAS GONNA ASK AYE AYE PROPS ONE TO BE OPPOSITION A CHANCE TO RESPOND TO THAT POINT IN PARTICULAR THIS -- GOES NO FURTHER THAN WHAT'S CURRENTLY IN THE CONTACTS. YOU I WON'T I'M TICKET TAKE A STAB AT THAT ON IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IT'S NOT SO MUCH THE PROCESS IT'S THE ORDER OF THE PROCESS. THAT IS AT ISSUE IN TERMS OF IT WHEN OF THIS CLEARANCE AND PERMISSION MIGHT BE SOUGHT. AND PERCENT TO THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL. SO -- YOU KNOW FROM AROUND THIS PART -- REACHED OUT TO TRY TO CLARIFY THAT ANY -- ANYTHING THAT MIGHT INVOLVE A PRE CLEARANCE ELEMENTS AND THE AND THIS YOU KNOW UP THERE SOME VARIATIONS OF THAT OPINION BUT THIS IS WHY DISCUSSION IS NECESSARY. BUT FOR BARONE IS PART WE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO CLARIFY THAT THE ONLY -- EXCLUSION ORDERS THAT MIGHT BECOME UNDER THIS PRE CLEARANCE BY THE LABOR PANEL -- PROCESS WHITNEY THOSE ACTIONS THAT ARE CLEARLY -- LABOR RELATED ACTIVITY. AND WE THINK THAT THAT IS A FAIR LIMITATION ON THIS SORT OF PERMISSION OR PRE CLEARANCE UP PROCESS -- BUT WE WHAT WE WANT TO CLARIFY A AND WE OFFERED WHAT WE THOUGHT AND WAS REALLY SORT OF SURGICAL -- FOCUS TO CLARIFYING LANGUAGE -- WAS TO CLARIFY THAT IF THERE ARE ANY TRULY ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES THAT GO WELL BEYOND LEGAL -- LABOR ACTIVITIES THEN THAT WOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO THE PRE CLEARANCE. SO THAT'S ONE IDEA AND ONE EXAMPLE THAT WAS FLOATED BUT THERE WAS NO MEANINGFUL DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT IDEA -- INSTEAD THERE WAS JUST AS SORT OF AN OUTRIGHT DISMISSAL. BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT TOO IF IF -- STAFF CAN ADD CASSIN'S LETTER WHICH IS THE TRIBAL LINES A SOVEREIGN INDIAN NATIONS WHICH REPRESENTS THE SOUTHERN NEVADA TRIBES AYE MEANS THAT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TRIBES. AND THEY'RE ALSO IN OPPOSITION -- AS WELL AS P. CHUNKS LETTER OF THEM ON JUST FOR PUT AND SO IT'S MORE THAN JUST THREE TRIBES THEIR POSTINGS. REFORM PASS OUT AND RETURN SUPPORT. YOU KNOW THE DAHLE CANCELLATIONS ON EKEUS ACTS AS SORT OF I THROUGH THE TRIBES IN SUPPORTER AT DO YOU AGREE. THAT. IN OPPOSING A THIRD PARTY IN THE FORM OF THE THE TRIBAL LABOR PANEL -- IS. SOME INTRUSION ON TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY OR DO YOU DISAGREE I DISAGREE IT'S OUR ARMY SOMETHING WE WOULD AGREE. TO AGAIN AMBER OWNERS LETTER THEY CITE EXAMPLES IN EMPLOYEE WHO STEALS A PURSE. THAT EMPLOYEE WOULD BE FIRED FOR VIOLATION OF OF THAT. THAT THE COMPANY IS POLICY. THEY'RE NOT ORGANIZING. THEY WOULD BE FIRED THAT'S THE EXAMPLE OF THE BARONE A LADDER SO YOU HAVE TO CLARIFY AGAIN OF A PERSON'S. AN EMPLOYEE WHOSE NORMIE ORGANIZING. THAT'S WHAT WE WOULD GO TO REGULATIONS PANEL THAT EMPLOYEE VIOLATES THEIR TRIBES IN THE CASINOS POLICIES RELATIVE DISTILLING A PURSE. THEY WOULD BE FIRED THERE'S NO NEED TO GO TO THE LABOR RELATIONS PANEL MANDATORY. AND THAT'S LEGAL OPINION YOU KNOW. I AT THE RISK OF TOO MUCH OF A BACK AND FORTH FAMILY AND SHARE WITH YOUR PERMISSION PERHAPS I CAN GIVE -- THE OPPOSITION A CHANCE TO ADDRESS THAT POINT. WE WE WOULD ARGUE AND OF COURSE LAWYERS HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS AND DIFFERENT ANALYSES BUT YOU KNOW THAT IS THAT IS ALMOST EXACTLY THE POINT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE VERY CRYSTAL CLEAR. AND WE OFFERED LITERALLY A THREE OR FOUR WERE CHANGE -- IN THE RELEVANT LANGUAGE I TRY TO PROVIDE THAT CLARITY AND WE DO BELIEVE THAT ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION. COULD BEAR FRUIT ON THIS POINT BUT TO DATE WHAT WE'VE RECEIVED IS -- SORT OF REJECTIONS VIA A EMAIL FRANKLY AND I THINK THAT AS PAUL APPOINTED OUT SORT OF IT MORE ALL TRIBES APPROACH -- THAT THAT IS -- THAT -- WHERE THERE'S A WILLINGNESS TO HAVE A DISCUSSION TO ACHIEVE THIS CLARITY IS WHAT IS REALLY DESIRED AND NEEDED AT THIS POINT? OKAY ORDER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS THE THROUGHPUT CLICK. OBVIOUSLY BY THIS DISCUSSION SHOWS THERE'S SOME. SOME REAL SENSITIVITIES HERE THAT I BELIEVE STILL NEED TO BE WORKED THROUGH. I WILL SUPPORT TODAY BUT IF SOME OF THOSE SENSITIVITIES CONTINUE TO BE A CONCERN I MAY CHANGE THAT SUPPORT [inaudible] QUESTION. YOU MAY CLOSE WAS HUESO. THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT TODAY -- IF YOU KNOW AGAIN THIS THIS -- BILL WAS THOROUGHLY REVIEWED AT THE SENATE LEVEL AND YOU KNOW WE WE CAME UP THROUGH. OF BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR IT -- YOU KNOW I WE WE TRY TO MAKE THIS ALL THE LANGUAGE CONSISTENT WITH CURRENTLY WHAT'S THE CURRENT STATE LAW. WHY OTHER PEOPLE HAVE LANGUAGE THAT'S PERMISSIVE THAT ALLOWS LAW ENFORCEMENT A STEP AND WE BASICALLY TOOK THAT? AND AND INSERTED INTO -- ALLOWING TRIBES TO GET THE SAME SERVICES. A AS CALIPHATE MEAN THEY ARE -- SOVEREIGN. A THEY ARE SOVEREIGN GOVERNMENTS BUT THEY ALSO ARE CALIFORNIA CORPORATIONS TO PROVIDE EMPLOYMENT TO CALIFORNIA'S THAT PROVIDE A HUGE BENEFIT TO OUR STATE. AND THEY SHOULD BE PROVIDE THE SAME SERVICES AS AS OTHER BUSINESSES. BECAUSE THEY DO MAKE A OF MEANINGFUL CONTRIBUTION TO OUR ECONOMY AND TO OUR QUALITY OF LIFE IN CALIFORNIA AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN. A YOU KNOW SEE SEE THE SENSE IN WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE. AND SEE THAT IT DOES MAKE SENSE SEE THAT IT'S CONSISTENT AND SEE THAT NO ONE WILL BE HARMED BY IT. ONLY PEOPLE WILL BE HELPED AND AND THAT'S WHY WE SHOULD BEFORE WITH THIS BILL LAST FOR YOUR SUPPORT TO THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND UP AYE PUBLISHES LOOK WHEN WHEN BILLS COME OVER FROM PUBLIC SAFETY TO OUR SIDE PUBLIC SAFETY. TO TO THE SENATE SIDE HAVE TO SAY THAT BECAUSE THE STEAM CHAIRWOMAN OF PUBLIC SAFETY IS RIGHT BEHIND YOU -- WHICH WE SOMETIMES SEE SOMETHING'S. THAT I DIDN'T SEE THAT SHE DIDN'T SEE AND AND AND WE WE ASK THOSE QUESTIONS SO IT'S NOT. THAT WE BELIEVE THAT THE SENATE DID NOT DO THEIR DUE DILIGENCE ACTUALLY DO BELIEVE THAT. AND I WOULD NEVER DISRESPECT. I CHAIR PUBLIC SAFETY BY BY SAYING THAT ESPECIALLY SINCE SHE'S IN THE ROOM BUT I HOPE THE CLERK WILL HELP YOU CLARIFY IT YES. I ALSO WANT. THEY ALSO SAY DO PUT OUT AT NO UNTIL I GOT MORE INFORMATION ALLEN THANK YOU SENATOR HUESO YOU AND AND OTHERS WHO CORRECTED ME ON SOME INFORMATION THAT THAT WAS WRONG. INFO ONCE I GOT THAT AND MORE CLARITY IT BECAME ON THAT'S WHY WENT TO A NON. RECOMMENDATION -- AND IT TEARS MY HERE MY ISSUES OUT IT STARTS WITH THIS WHOLE NOTION. OF DEA'S AND LAW ENFORCEMENT NOT DOING THEIR JOB. THAT IN SOME PARTS OF THE STATE THEY ARE ENFORCING THE TRUST PASS LAWS AND IN SOME. THEY DOING. TO OF DOING IT OR NOT TO THAT. BOB THIS MEET TO KNOW WHEN. AND I WANT TO THANK THE MEMBERS THAT CAME IN TODAY BECAUSE WE HAD A DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT AND THIS IS WHERE I'M GOING WITH A REALLY GOOD ONE HOUR FORTY FIVE MINUTE DISCUSSION. AND I THINK WE ALMOST CAME. TO A RESOLUTION WOULDN'T COME TO A RESOLUTION BUT WE GOT REAL CLOSE TO HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING HOW WE COULD GET PAST. ENSURING THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL ENFORCE TO TRESPASS LAWS -- DATA ON THE BOOKS NOW ANY AUTHORITY THAT THEY HAVE NOW IT DO WE NEED TO TWEAK SOME WORDING -- A FORTUNE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO COME TO COMPLETE THAT BUT I FELT REALLY GOOD THAT JUST IN A FORTY FIVE MINUTE DISCUSSION. WERE ABLE TO TUNE TO MOVE THE BALL A LITTLE BIT -- I STILL HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT DUE PROCESS -- WHETHER AYE TO TRIBAL AUTHORITY. ON THE COUNCIL WAYS AND LABOR WHETHER IT'S TO WANTED TO GOING TO DO THE IT DID MAKE A DECISION WHO BE EXPELLED A HOOT NOT THAT THAT BOTHERS YOU GONNA KEEP ASKING. WHO IS IT AND I GOT SOME CLARITY ON? WE KNOW PEOPLE WHO ARE RISK TO PUBLIC SAFETY. BUT I GET BACK TO GET BACK TO LA FORCE -- BY AS I SAID IN THE MEETING SOMEBODY WALKS INTO THE CASINO HAVE FIRED FIVE ROUNDS OFF WOULD IT WOULD IT WOULD IT WOULD A GUN. YOU'RE TELLING ME THEY CAN COME BACK TOMORROW FIRE FIVE ROUNDS IS SOMETHING. SOMETHING LAW ENFORCEMENT NOT BEEN ARRESTED MORE TO GOING TO TAKE A MOUNTAIN CATCH AND RELEASE THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG. WITH IT IT'S NOT MAKING ANY SENSE TO ME SOMEBODY'S GOTTA GO TO JAIL. AT LEAST FOR A LITTLE WHILE TO A MAKE BAIL BUT THAT'S A WHOLE NOTHER DISCUSSION IT WILL HAVE RIGHT NOW. AND I THAT THAT BOTHERS ME. TO KNOW WHEN THAT THAT THAT'S THE CASE AND THEN THIS WHOLE PROCESS DUE PROCESS AND THE REASON YOU GO TO THE COURTS. THIRD PARTY IS SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT. IT'S NOT PERSONAL. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S DONE ARBITRARY CAPRICIOUS THAT THAT THAT IT'S DATA TRIBAL COUNCIL RULES AND REGULATIONS. MAYBE SIMILAR BUT WELFARE DISCUSSION WHETHER NOT IN THE SAME AS TO STATE COURTS AND WE'RE GOING BACK AND FORTH AND I THOUGHT. DATE DO YOU OFFER. THAT WERE MADE IN MY OFFICE THAT WE HAVE MEMBERS OF PUBLIC SAFETY GO OUT. AND ACTUALLY VIEW TO COURT AND SEE HOW THEY ADJUDICATE. THESE PROBLEMS WOULD WOULD BE GOOD -- BUT I GUESS IT'S BACK. TO YOU KNOW WE NEED MORE TIME. AND CARD ROOMS [inaudible] AND RACE TRACKS ARE NOT SOVEREIGN NATIONS. SO THE COMPARED TO TO SAY THEY SHOULD HAVE THE SAME THE REASON WE'RE HERE IS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT THE SAME THEY'RE NOT. THE RACE TRACK IS NOT A SOVEREIGN NATION EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY THINK THEY ARE THEY ARE NOT A SOVEREIGN NATION. AND SO WE'RE HERE BECAUSE OF THAT. AND SO I I'M GOOD AND NOT VOTE AND I WOULD HOPE. THAT OTHER MEMBERS NOT. VOTE. LAYOFF TODAY SO THAT. THEN IT GOES [inaudible] TO WHERE. AND I WOULD ASK. IT DOESN'T PASS BASS RECONSIDERATION AND THAT WE FORCE EVERYBODY. COME TOGETHER BIND BEFORE NEXT WEEK TO LEASE START IRON SOME OF THESE OUT TO THE ONLY FILL HAPPEN NEXT WEEK. IF IT FAILS TODAY. IS IS A UPPER DOWN VOTE AND UNLESS. CHAIR CAN SEE SOME PROGRESS AND NOT HEY I'VE BEEN IN THE MIDDLE. OF SOME BATTLES. BETWEEN. TWO VERY POWERFUL ENTITIES. AND ARE I DON'T RELISH PUTTING MYSELF. IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS COMMITTEE IN THE MIDDLE. BUT I SURE DON'T WANNA PUT THE ENTIRE LEGISLATURE ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE IN THE MIDDLE OF A FAMILY. I SAY THAT AND SO AT AT THIS POINT I'M HOPING THAT THIS COMMITTEE WOULD AT LEAST. GIVE THE PARTIES [inaudible] AND ME. SOME TIME TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT SOME WAYS WE CAN COME. TO ON SOME REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS. AT LEAST GIVE TO FAILING THAT EVERYBODY'S GOING TO WORK TOGETHER SO IF IT DOES GET OUT NEXT WEEK WE KNOW IT'S GOING THE RIGHT PLACE TOWARDS [inaudible] THE FIRST FLOOR. AND SO THAT'S WHAT I'M ASKING FOR TODAY FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON TO TO LAYOFF TODAY. OR DON'T GIVE ME A MOTION. OR IT'S UP TO THE COMMITTEE OKAY. POINT OF CLARIFICATION HOLD ON PEOPLE WISER TO ME. MADE A RECOMMENDATION. COULDN'T SELECT WAS A BOW MOTION I COULD HOLD IT IN COMMITTEE AND THEN. WAIT TO TAKE A VOTE NEXT WEEK. AND GIVE PARTIES TO COME TOGETHER. THAT WAY YOU DON'T HAVE AN UPPER DOWN NOW ORDER WAITING FOR MOTION WHICH DIDN'T SEEM LIKE IT WAS. THE REAL QUICKLY. TESTIMONY IT AND WHEREAS WHEN IT WOULD BE WILL JUST TO TESTIMONY ONLY. IF NEXT WEEK. I WILL TAKE OF WHAT NEXT WEEK. I THINK OKAY. ALRIGHT [inaudible] THANK [inaudible] BUT BUT HELLO. HI SINNERS [inaudible] SKINNER. HELLO MY FELLOW PUBLIC SAFETY CHAIRED A VERY PLEASED TO BE BEFORE YOU OF PAULA AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR KIND REMARKS EARLIER IN THAT. THAT BILL THAT YOU JUST HEARD WAS MENDED AFTER MY COMMITTEE SO THE OPPOSITION THAT WAS PRESENT TODAY WAS NOT IN MY COMMITTEE ANYWAY [inaudible] ENOUGH SAID [inaudible] BUT WHAT IF YOU MIND IF I START WITH S. B. [inaudible] TEN TWENTY FIVE WE PULL. YES AGAIN WHEN THE RIGHT EXCELLENT SO I'M GONNA DO IT FAST BECAUSE I HAVE TO GO BACK UP TO ENERGY COMMITTEE. GOT OF COURSE I WELCOME ANY DISCUSSION BY WOULD DO IT QUICKLY SP TEN TWENTY FIVE RESTORES JUDICIAL DISCRETION FOR CERTAIN NON VIOLENT DRUG CRIMES. IN RESEARCH BACKED BY THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION AND OTHERS HAVE FOUND THAT MANDATORY MINIMUMS [inaudible] SPECIFICALLY TOWARDS DRUG CRIMES DO NOT [inaudible] REDUCE EITHER [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] WELL [inaudible] HOW? TREATING NEED DIRECTION DIRECTLY CAN SOMETIMES HAVE BETTER OUTCOMES SO THIS ALLOWS THE JUDGE TO FACTOR IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES AND WITH THAT. I'M GOING TO ASK ME WITNESSES TO PRESENT BRIEFLY AND WE'LL SEE IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS. THE MORNING -- HARLAN GROSSMAN I'M A RETIRED JUDGE FROM CONTRA COSTA COUNTY A RETIRED SIX YEARS AGO AFTER TWENTY ONE YEARS OF JUDICIAL SERVICE I WAS A PROSECUTOR FOR NINE YEARS BEFORE BECOMING A JUDGE. SINCE RETIRING I'VE BEEN ACTIVE REMAINED ACTIVE INCOME OF JUSTICE POLICY ADVOCACY. I'M PRESIDENT THIS MORNING TO ADVOCATE IN FAVOR OF SENATE BILL TEN TWENTY FIVE WHICH WOULD REPEAL THE PROBATION AND ELIGIBILITY AND BART A SUSPENSION OF SENTENCE PROVISIONS. FOR CERTAIN ENUMERATED NON VIOLENT DRUG OFFENSES THEREBY RESTORING JUDICIAL DISCRETION TO IMPOSE THE APPROPRIATE SIZE. TAILORED TO THE INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH DEFENDANT THAT COMES BEFORE THE COURT. RESTRICTIONS ON JUDICIAL DISCRETION IN SENTENCING DO NOT SERVE AS A DETERRENT TO CRIME RATHER THEY ONLY MOVED THE BILL. AND I WILL BE TAKING THE COMMITTEES RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS [inaudible] THANK YOU. OF RESTRICTIONS ON JUDICIAL DISCRETION SOMETHING DO NOT SERVE AS A DETERRENT TO CRIME RATHER THEY ONLY SERVE TO LIMIT THE DISCRETION TO TIE THE HANDS OF JUDGES INVOLVED IN THE ADJUDICATION DISPOSITION. AND RESOLUTION OF THESE CASES IT MAKES LITTLE SENSE TO LIMIT JUDICIAL DISCRETION AND THE SENTENCING OF THESE MATTERS WHEN JUDGES RETAIN AN EXERCISE OF DISCRETION A MUCH WEIGHTIER ISSUES SUCH AS WHETHER TO IMPOSE THE DEATH PENALTY WHETHER TO STRIKE A STRIKE CONVICTION. WHETHER CASE SHOULD PROCEED IN JUVENILE COURT TO BE TRANSFERRED TO CRIMINAL COURT. WHEN IT COMES TO SENTENCING CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOT HAVE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH? MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCES ARE NOT EFFECTIVE IN ANY WAY INCLUDING NOT BEING COST EFFECTIVE. AND ACTING SENATE BILL TEN TWENTY FIVE WILL PERMIT MORE IF FISH EFFECTIVE DEFENDANT BASED SENTENCING AND MORE EFFICIENT USE OF CALIFORNIA'S CRIMINAL JUSTICE RESOURCES. THANK YOU THANK YOU PERHAPS BEFORE THE NEXT WITNESS I'LL JUST QUICKLY SAY BE I'M COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. CREATE CONSISTENCY IN PROBATION ELIGIBILITY AND SO I AM TAKING NICE THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOTTEN GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS VELASCO WIN AND I AM A SENIOR TRIAL ATTORNEY AT THE SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE. ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING ASPECTS OF IS WATCHING -- INDIGENT. PEOPLE OF COLOR FOR MENTALLY ILL AND ADDICTED TO DRUGS BE SENT TO PRISON. BECAUSE THEY'RE DEEMED UNWORTHY OF HOPE AND TREATMENT. I THE CURRENT LAW PREVENTS ME FROM NEGOTIATING MEANINGFUL TREATMENT AND INSTEAD I M. LIMITED BY ASKING FOR AT THE MOST MITIGATED TERM. THE MOST COMMON DRUG OFFENSES THAT I SEE ON A DAILY BASIS HAPPEN EXPOSURE OF THREE FOUR OR FIVE YEARS IN STATE PRISON. SO WHEN I WALK OUT OF COURT WITH A THREE YEAR STATE PRISON THAT IS TEAM TO A VICTORY OUR JUDICIAL DISCRETION IS REQUIRED FOR JUSTICE THIS IS NOT A MANDATE IT'S ANOTHER OPTION. I AM REQUESTING YOUR IPHONE THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY. GLENN BACK IS FOR DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE CO SPONSOR OF THE BILL.

ALRIGHTY YOU MAY CLOSE -- WITHOUT QUESTIONS IN THE DICE ALL JUST ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT WITH THE AMENDED BILL. THANK YOU [inaudible] WHOEVER. LET'S CALL THE ROLL. S. B. TEN TWENTY FIVE THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER AYE JONES SAWYER AYE LACKEY. LACKEY NO CARILLO CARILLO I KAMLAGER-DOVE. KAMLAGER-DOVE I KILEY. QUIRK AYE QUIRK AYE SANTIAGO. THAT MEASURE PASSES CONGRADULATIONS [inaudible] AND NOW. THE ONE SP. TWELVE HUNDRED THANK YOU MUCH. SHARON MEMBERS. SP TWELVE HUNDRED WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY I CARRIED -- AB TEN FOURTEEN WHICH WAS PASSED AND SIGNED INTO LAW AND THAT ESTABLISHED CALIFORNIA'S GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER WHICH IS ALSO KNOWN AS A VIOLENCE RISK PREVENTION ORDER -- SO WE WERE THE FIRST STATE WHILE THERE ARE OTHER STATES THAT HAVE. SUBSEQUENTLY HAVE ENACTED YOU WE WERE THE FIRST TO CREATE A TOOL THAT FAMILY MEMBERS COULD USE WHEN THEY NEW. THAT SOMEONE I LOVED ONE WAS THREATENING SELF HARM. TO THEMSELVES IN OTHER WORDS SELF HARM OR VIOLENCE AGAINST OTHERS. THE MARCH TWENTY EIGHTEEN ISSUE OF THE ECONOMIST LISTED GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS OR VIOLENCE RISK PREVENTION ORDERS AS THEY TURN THEM. AS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE TOOLS IN SAVING LIVES FROM GUN VIOLENCE NOW WHAT THIS BILL DOES YOU MIGHT ASK WHERE WE HAVE ONE WHAT IT WHAT IS THIS BILL DO. IT IMPROVES THERE ARE EXISTING STATUTE BY ELIMINATING THE FEES FOR ISSUING. A ORDER WE DO NOT WANT THE COST TO BE AN OBSTACLE TO SOMEONE SEEKING A PETITION. IT ALSO EXPANDS THE G. BUREAU TO COVER FIRE ARM COMPONENTS NOW I HAD A LEGITIMATE QUESTION ABOUT WHY. BECAUSE IN INDIVIDUAL FIREARM COMPONENT OBVIOUSLY IT CAN'T JUST BE AS DEADLY AS A FIREARM BUT AS WE KNOW FIRE ARMS CAN BE DISASSEMBLED. AND UNLESS BE A PERSON -- ARRIVING TO ISSUE THE AND WHAT IF THEY DO NOT ASK FOR ALL FIRE EARN COMPONENTS YOU COULD HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THE PERSON HAS DISASSEMBLED A FIRE ARM. AND THAT'S THEY'VE NOT RECOVERED THE FIRE ARMS IN THE PERSON'S POSSESSION. SO THAT IS PART OF THE REASON FOR THAT AMENDMENT. ADDITIONALLY IT IMPROVES DUE PROCESS BY REQUIRING A HEARING FOR THE EMERGENCY GBR ROSE WITHIN TWENTY ONE DAYS. SO WE'VE AND RITUALLY DESIGNED THE STATUE TO RESPECT DUE PROCESS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BUT SAW. OVER TIME THAT WE HAD FAILED TO REQUIRE THAT HEARING IN THE US HEARINGS WERE NOT OCCURRING SO THAT'S THE BILL IN ITS FORM. ANDA I WOULD LIKE ME WITNESSES TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM ALISON AND HER MAN AND ATTORNEY AT GIFFORD'S LAW CENTER TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE AND ON BEHALF OF OUR ORGANIZATION I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT SP TWELVE HUNDRED A BILL WE HAVE CO SPONSORED. THIS BILL MAKES IMPORTANT AND RELATIVELY MINOR CHANGES TO THE EXISTING GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER LAW AND AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED IT WOULD INSURE THAT INABILITY TO PAY IS NEVER A BARRIER TO PREVENTING VIOLENCE. IT WOULD ALSO MAKE IT HARDER FOR RESPONDENTS TO ASSEMBLE FUNCTIONAL FIREARMS BY REQUIRING THEM TO RELINQUISH PARTS AND COMPONENTS THAT ARE CLEARLY DESIGNED AND INTENDED TO BE USED TO ASSEMBLE. A FULLY FUNCTIONAL FIREARM THIS IS NOT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT SPRINGS HERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT UNFINISHED FRAMES AND RECEIVERS. THIRD IT WOULD MAKE IT HARDER FOR PERSON TO USE A FIRE ARM ILLEGALLY BY REQUIRING RESPONDENTS TO RELINQUISH MAGAZINES. AND IT WOULD ALSO IN SHORT THAT A ONE YEAR HEARING IT'S SAD WITHIN TWENTY ONE DAYS OF A COURT ISSUING A TEMPORARY EMERGENCY G. VERO OBTAINED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. AS IS ALREADY THE PROCESS FOR EX PARTE ORDERS. THE BILL WOULD ALSO MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO KNOW THAT RESPONDED HAS OR HAS NOT RELINQUISHED FIREARMS. BECAUSE THESE FIXES TO THE G. VERO STATUTE ARE MODEST REASONABLE AND INTENDED TO MAKE THE ORDERS MORE EFFECTIVE I URGE YOU TO VOTE I GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS MARISSA MAKE SHOWN AND I WORK AT THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. AND I'M GRATEFUL TO SENATOR SKINNER -- FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK WE PROBABLY SUPPORT -- AND AGREE WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS -- THAT ARE IN AS SPEECH I MERELY BECAUSE LARGE PART OF MY WORK NOW IS -- HELPING OBTAIN THESE G. BARROWS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND IN THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS THERE'VE BEEN INCREDIBLY POWERFUL EXAMPLES OF THE UTILITY OF THIS TOOL -- THE EXAMPLES THAT WE'VE SEEN HAVE BEEN A MENTALLY ILL SON WHO'S PROLIFERATING WEAPONS WHOSE PROACTIVE PARENTS WERE ABLE -- TO GET LAW ENFORCEMENT TO HELP STEP IN AND WERE IT NOT FOR THESE AMENDMENTS THERE ARE SOME MAJOR OBSTACLES FOR US THAT'S HAD. TO FIX THAT'S IN HERE THAT WERE SO THRILLED ABOUT IS REQUIRING AND ACTUALLY TRIGGERING A ONE YEAR HEARING WHEN YOU APPLY FOR A TEMPORARY ORDER. BECAUSE THIS IS BEEN A MAJOR OBSTACLE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO HAVE IT TNCS TEMPORARY EMERGENCY ORDERS AND THEN DIDN'T GET AN AUTOMATIC HEARING AND THAT'S BEEN A PROBLEM FOR US IN OUR JURISDICTION IN SEVERAL. OF FAIRLY HIGH PROFILE CASES THAT I'VE EXPERIENCED -- AND THEN WE ARE ALSO VERY THRILLED TO SEE THE COMPONENT PARTS AMENDMENT -- MORE FIX TO THIS LAW BECAUSE THAT AND IN -- SEVERAL OF THE GDR OWES THAT WE'VE DONE IN OUR JURISDICTION IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS THERE HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY TONS OF THESE COMPONENT PARTS LOWERS UPPERS UNASSEMBLED FIREARMS THAT WHEN WE'VE GONE AND CITIES ON HIGH RISK SITUATIONS. HAD WE NOT HAD THIS FIX IN THE LAW THERE WAS SOME CONFUSION BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AND IT WOULD HAVE LEFT BEHIND -- FIRE ARM THAT -- THIS IS A VERY COMMON THERE ARE THAT WILL HELP US ON ENSURE PUBLIC SAFETY SO I WE AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS AND IN IN PRACTICAL. USE THINK THAT THEY WILL HELP PREVENT FUTURE VIOLENCE. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. AMANDA WILCOXSON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTERS OF THE BRADY CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE WE ARE ALSO CO SPONSORS OF THE BILL AND URGE DRIVE VOTE. CALVIN QUICK ON BEHALF OF BAY AREA STUDENT ACTIVISTS IN SUPPORT. EDU ME WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. I NEED TO SEE MISTER CHAIRMAN A MEMBERS AND MADAM CHAIR -- FIRST OF ALL WITH THEM. WE THINK IT'S A VERY POSITIVE THING THAT THAT YOU'VE DONE IN IN THIS BILL. TO TIM MAKE SURE THAT DUE PROCESS IS AT THE FRONT END. WE THANK YOU FOR THAT BECAUSE WE THINK THAT IS A TENANT OF OUR DEMOCRACY -- OF OF OF REALLY TRUE GOOD JUSTICE IN AMERICA AND HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. WE DO WANT TO POINT OUT A COUPLE OF CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE WITH WITH WITH THE THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL. THE THE FIRST OF ALL IT DOESN'T SAY THE DEFINITIONS THAT ARE USED LEGISLATIVELY WITH REGARD TO WHAT CONSTITUTES A GUN PART -- IS OPEN TO MASSIVE -- INTERPRETATION AND IT IN REALITY IF THEY HAD TRIGGERS BARRELS STOCKS. GRIPS ALL OF THOSE THINGS THERE. UNLESS THEY HAD THAT PORTION THAT IS THE FIRE ARM ITSELF -- IT IS ALL OF THOSE THINGS COULD NEVER BECOME A GUN [inaudible] NOW. SO EVERY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER KNOWS THAT A RECEIVER WEATHER STRIP OR FULLY ASSEMBLED INTO THE GUN IS IS THE GUN AND IS THE CRITICAL PART. TO MAKE A GUN SO -- HE IS. THE DEFINITION YOU KNOW IF SOMEBODY SEES A TRIGGER GROUP THAT LOOKS LIKE IT COULD GO INTO NAY ARE FIFTEEN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR A BOLT ACTION RIFLE. CLEARLY IT'S A TRICKLE GROUP CRADLED CLEARLY IT'S A PART OF A GUN BUT I COULD NEVER BECOME A GUN OR BE USED. AS SUCH THE OTHER CONCERN THAT WE HAVE IS WITH THE THAT THE GBR ROSE AND WE'VE DONE A LITTLE BIT OF RESEARCH TO FIND THAT. THERE BEEN UP APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED EUROS THAT HAVE BEEN ISSUED THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY. AND SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE AS FAR AS THE THE ABUSE OF PEOPLE FILING THEM ALICIA SALI. ARE HAVE NOT OCCURRED. BUT THE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE IS THAT. PUTTING OUR ATTENTION AND AND FOCUS ON THE GB RO IT'S IT YOU GO ON YOU SAY OKAY. YOU WERE A DANGER TO YOURSELF OR OTHERS AND A FAMILY MEMBER OR A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER AND IN REALITY. ANYBODY CAN ASK A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER TO REQUESTED UV RO. IT'S GRANTED AND THEY THEY GET THEY LOSE THEIR GUNS THAT YEAH WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS ARE GONNA THEY'RE GONNA LOSE THEIR GUNS [inaudible] BUT THEN. NOTHING ELSE HAPPENS. IF YOU'RE DANGER TO YOURSELF FOR OTHERS YOU JUST GO OUT THERE AND NOTHING IN THE LAW PREVENTS YOU FROM. BORROWING A GUN OR YOU CAN BREAK THE LAW AND STEAL A GUN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHERE IS WE BELIEVE THAT THEIR EXISTING PROCEDURES AND IN STATE LAW ALREADY IN PLACE -- IN IN PLACE THAT WILL -- ACTUALLY HAVE PROVISIONS. THAT CHECK TO SEE IF THESE PEOPLE REALLY DO NEED EMOTIONAL HELP AND THEM HAVE THEM. RECEIVE THAT HELP THAT TO US% MAKE SENSE BUT JUST SAYING NO YOU'RE GONNA LOSE YOUR GUN RIGHTS BECAUSE WE THINK YOU'RE DANGER TO YOURSELF OR OTHERS GO OFTEN. MAKE PEACE OR DO YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND SOMEONE WE DON'T THINK IS A IS IS IS A GOOD WAY OF OF STOPPING. PEOPLE FROM COMMITTING NON VIOLENT ACTS FOR THOSE REASONS DOES CALIFORNIA. WITH APPRECIATION FOR THE THE THE ISSUES THAT ARE DISCUSSED WERE POSTED THANK YOU MISTER MR DELUDE. IS A MIXTURE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CRADLE IS ABOUT THE FIRES POLICY COALITION -- JUST TO START OFF WE HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENT WITH THE WAY IN WHICH GOODBYES RESTRAINING ORDERS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN THE PROCESS IN THIS BILL ONCE AGAIN WE BELIEVE DOES NOT INCLUDE DUE PROCESS. DUE PROCESS AFTER YOU'VE LOST YOUR RIGHTS IS NOT DUE PROCESS TIMING IS A KEY COMPONENT TO DUE PROCESS AYE AND WE BELIEVE THAT -- SO SO THE CONCEPT IN GENERAL WE HAVE AN ISSUE WITH WE NOW IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE WHERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FIREARM PARTS -- ONCE AGAIN HE BILL THAT WAS MENTIONED BY BY ONE OF THE FOLKS TEST VOTING TESTIFYING IN FAVOR THAT THERE CLEARLY SPEAKING TO UNFINISHED RECEIVERS. I DON'T SEE THAT LANGUAGE IN THE BILL I JUST SEE CLEARLY IDENTIFIABLE AND THE QUESTION IS CLEARLY IDENTIFIABLE TO WHO. YOU SOMEONE WHO KNOWS AND UNDERSTANDS WHAT A FIRE ARM LOOKS LIKE WHAT FIRE ON PARTS ARE OR TO SOMEONE WHO MAYBE THINKS THEY DO. I'VE I'VE COME IN HERE AND TESTIFIED BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE BRINGING VARIOUS FIREARM PARTS WALKING THROUGH -- WALKING THROUGH THE THE SERGEANTS WITH THINGS ARE CLEARLY FIREARM PARTS JIMMY BUT CLEARLY THEY WEREN'T FIREARM PARTS TO THEM BECAUSE GUESS WHAT I WAS HERE IN THE COMMITTEE TESTIFYING. SHARING THESE WITH YOU OF THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT ARE NOT CLEARLY IDENTIFIABLE AS FIREARM PARTS SUCH AS THE 0% LOWER THAN I PRESENTED A TWO YEARS AGO IN THIS PARTICULAR COMMITTEE. ONCE AGAIN. TO KNOW WHAT OUT TO OTHER PEOPLE TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE EXPERIENCE KNOWING ABOUT FIREARMS THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A FIRE ON PART BUT I RECOGNIZE IT IS HAVING A CNC MACHINE. THAT CAN BE TURNED INTO A FIREARM. THE OTHER ISSUE THAT I THAT WE HAVE QUITE FRANKLY HAS TO DO WITH -- YOU KNOW DE DE ONCE AGAIN THE RANDOMNESS OF OKAY SO HOW WE GONNA DECIDE WHICH PARTS ARE LEGITIMATELY GOING TO BE GOING TO TRIGGER -- THAT THE A VIOLATION OF THE G. V. RO. A OFTENTIMES PEOPLE WHO WON'T FIRE. MAYBE I DO WANT TO CHANGE OUT. TRIGGER ON MY ON MY FIREARM BECAUSE I WANT SOMETHING THAT'S EITHER SAFER OR BETTER A THAT WOULD THAT WORKS BETTER SO NOW I GET RID AYE AYE AYE AYE SWITCH OUT THE TRIGGER. AYE MAYBE LEAVE IT SITTING ON MY WORK BENCH THOSE GEV RO SOMEONE COMES IN THEY TAKE ALL MY FIREARMS. BUT I STILL HAVE THE TRIGGER IN A DRAWER IN MY IN MY AREA IN MY WORK BENCH HAVE I NOW VIOLATED THIS GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER -- I JUST THINK THAT THAT THAT HAVING PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW OR UNDERSTAND FIREARMS -- RIGHT FIREARM BILLS AND TRY -- TO AND TRY TO PROVIDE DEFINITIONS IS A IS DANGEROUS AND POTENTIALLY PUTS PUTS THE RIGHTS OF LAW ABIDING CITIZENS ARE IN JEOPARDY IN IS FOR THESE REASONS THAT WE OPPOSE THIS MEASURE THANK YOU. ANY. ANY MALES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS [inaudible] YEAH. DODD WHERE I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE FOR DVR OWES AND I THINK THEY'RE IMPORTANT PART OF MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE DOING. ALL WE CAN TO PREVENT ANY KIND OF FOR CIRCUMSTANCES BUT AND THE THIS PARTS AND COMPONENTS THING IS FAIRLY -- HARD TO REALLY WRAP MY HEAD AROUND AND TO REALLY MAKE A DISTINCTIVE I KNOW WHAT THE INTENT IS. BUT THE APPLICATION IS ALSO BUT VERY VERY IMPORTANT. AND SO I KNOW THAT DIDN'T WE'VE. KIND OF PUT OUR HEADS TOGETHER KINDA LOOKING TO SEE IF WE CAN GET SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE CLARIFYING. AND AS A SUGGESTION SIXTEEN FIVE TWENTY OF THE PENAL CODE SECTION G.. OF THE LANGUAGE THERE. IT HELPS UNDERSTAND LITTLE BIT MORE WHEN IT DEFINES A FIREARM AND SAYS FIREARM INCLUDES THE UNFINISHED FRAME. OR RECEIVER OF A WEAPON THAT CAN READILY BE CONVERTED INTO THE FUNCTIONAL. CONDITION OF A FINISHED FRAME OR RECEIVER. THAT WOULD BE MORE CLARIFYING LANGUAGE I THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] OF THEY LOOK QUESTIONS. YES TO SKINNER MEGAN. YOU ANSWERS QUESTION YOUR CLOTHES. AND APPRECIATED TO WOULD YOU LIKE NICKERSON. OKAY I'M ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY WE IT'S MY UNDERSTAND THAT THIS BILL IF IT'S SUCCESSFUL TODAY WOULD GO TO THE PROPS COMMITTEE AND I'M CERTAINLY WILLING TO LOOK AT THAT PENAL CODE SECTION THAT YOU REFERRED REFERENCED -- BECAUSE CERTAINLY THAT IS OUR INTENTION. TO FOR THE INCLUSION OF THE FIREARM COMPONENTS. AND IT WILL A PART LEAD I WAS -- INCLUDED ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF RDAS. BECAUSE OF THE CONCERN THAT. BY LAW ENFORCEMENT NOT ASKING THE FULL QUESTION. IT LEAVING AN AFFECT THE ABILITY FOR THE PERSON WHOM THEY ARE ASSURING ORDER TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO HAVE MATERIALS THAT COULD ALLOW THEM TO ASSEMBLY WEAPON. SO I AM MORE THAN HAPPY TO LOOK AT THAT PENAL CODE SECTION. AND I'M SURE THE OTHER EXPERTS HERE IN THE COMMITTEE MIGHT ASSIST ME IN THE ACCU FIRST LAW CENTER TO SEE IF IT'S APPROPRIATE -- POTENTIAL AMENDMENT THAT MIGHT WORK FOR PROBES [inaudible] IF YOU.
