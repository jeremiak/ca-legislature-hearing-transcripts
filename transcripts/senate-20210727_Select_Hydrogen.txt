AND AGREED TO- STAY WITH US TO THE END OF THE QUESTIONS AND ANSWER PERIOD IT IS IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF US TO HEAR FROM YOU. NOW LET'S HEAR FROM OUR FIRST PRESENTER DR JACK BAUER. AND A DOCTOR YOU HAVE THIRTY MINUTES. AND THE TIME IS YOURS SO PLEASE BEGAN. ONLY. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR ARCHULETA- AND OTHER DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THIS SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE. ANYONE WHO CARES ABOUT ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT IS VERY THANKFUL AND GRATEFUL FOR YOUR- CONVENING OF THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT AND THEN TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT ACHIEVING ZERO EMISSIONS. AND HYDROGEN I KNOW IS GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR ACHIEVING ZERO EMISSIONS SO I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU. AND SINCE I'M A UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR WHO TEACHES ENGINEERING I ALWAYS LIKE TO TALK ABOUT MY THERMODYNAMICS CLASS AND THE FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS WHICH- EXPLAINS THAT ENERGY IS CONSERVED. AND SO ON EARTH IF WE DRAW CONTROL VOLUME AROUND THIS WE ONLY HAVE A FEW THINGS THAT CROSSED THIS CONTROL VOLUME. THE PRIMARY ONE GOING IN AND THROUGH THIS CONTROL VOLUME A SOLAR RADIATION. SOME OF THAT IS REFLECTED BACK OUT IN THE SAME WAVELENGTH SPECTRUM AS THE SUNS- WAVELENGTHS THEMSELVES. AND THEN OTHER RADIATION IS READING IT BACK THROUGH THE CONTROL VOLUME OUT TO SPACE IN A DIFFERENT WAVELENGTH REGIME. BECAUSE THE EARTH IS AT MUCH LOWER TEMPERATURE THAN THE SUN. AND OVER THE HISTORY OF THE EARTH. THERE HAS BEEN THIS BALANCE ALWAYS AND FOREVER THAT ANY CHANGE AND ENERGY ON THE EARTH. HAS THIS SOLAR RADIATION COMING AND MINUS THAT WHICH IS REFLECTED MONISTAT WHICH IS RE RADIATED BACK OUT TO SPACE. AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT ALL THE PRIMARY ENERGY RESOURCES THAT WE TEND TO CONVERT HERE ON EARTH HAVE COME FROM THIS AMAZING BALANCE. WE'VE SEEN OVER HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF YEARS TO MILLIONS OF YEARS DEAD PLANT AND ANIMAL LIFE WITH THE HEAT AND PRESSURE AGAIN BY THE POWER OF THE SUN CONVERTED TO FOSSIL FUELS LIKE COAL OIL AND NATURAL GAS. AND THESE HAVE. TAKES SO LONG TO MAKE ON EARTH THAT I HAVE TO DRAW HASH MARKS THROUGH THIS TIME FRAME. BECAUSE ALL OF THE OTHER FORMS OF PRIMARY ENERGY ARE-REPLENISHED NATURALLY ON EARTH IN A MUCH SHORTER TIME FRAME SO THINGS LIKE CORN TREES GRASS USUALLY TAKE MONTHS OR YEARS TO MAKE BIO ENERGY. IN THE FORM OF ETHANOL OR BIO GAS OR BIO. HYDROPOWER SUN POWER EVAPORATES THE WATERS MAKES THE CLOUDS IN THE CLOUDS RAIN ON TO THE HILLS AND WE HAVE HYDROPOWER BUT THIS TAKES ORDER OF MAGNITUDE WEEKS TO MONTHS TO OCCUR AND WIND POWER AGAIN BY THE POWER OF THE SUN WE CREATE THESE PRESSURE TEMPERATURE GRADIENTS THAT BRITISH PRESSURE GRADIENTS AND THE WIND BLOWS. BUT SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T BLOW FOR DAYS. OR EVEN WEEKS. WHEN SOLAR POWER IS THE MOST PREDICTABLE AND RELIABLY RETURN FORM OF ENERGY THE INSTEAD WE USE A UNIT OF SUN ENERGY UP. IT IS RETURNED TO US. AT LEAST DURING THE DAY. SO FROM AN ENGINEERING PERSPECTIVE. IT'S QUITE OBVIOUS THAT ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY REQUIRES THAT WE CONVERT THESE RESOURCES AT THE SAME RATE AT WHICH- IS NATURALLY REPLENISHES THEM. THIS IS A SIMPLE ENERGY BALANCE. I ALSO ADDED THAT IT SHOULD BE DONE WITHOUT EXTERNALITIES. SO THIS IS HOW WE ARE DOING WHEN IT COMES TO FOSSIL FUEL USE ON EARTH. IN THE TIME FRAME OF HUMAN HISTORY IT'S QUITE OBVIOUS THAT WE ARE NOT PRACTICING SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES FOSSIL ENERGY YEARS APPEARS AS A DELTA FUNCTION IN THE COURSE OF HUMAN HISTORY. IT'S QUITE OBVIOUSLY NOT SUSTAINABLE. AND HERE WHAT ABOUT THOSE EXTERNALITIES. ENERGY CONVERSION FOR THE MOST PART HAS IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE AND FREEDOM FREEDOM OF MOBILITY. BUT IT ALSO IS UNFORTUNATELY THE MOST SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND I SUGGEST GEOPOLITICAL PROBLEMS. THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ENERGY BALANCE YOU DON'T SEE. SO FOR EXAMPLE THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IS THE FACT THAT THE SAME ENERGY CONVERSION TECHNOLOGIES LEAD TO CRITERIA POLLUTANT EMISSIONS AND WHILE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS LED THE WORLD IN ADDRESSING CRITERIA POLLUTANTS AND IMPROVING AIR QUALITY WE STILL HAVE SO MANY PLACES EVEN IN THIS VERY WEALTHY AND- SUPER STRICT REGIME PORT FOR CONTROLLING. CRITERIA POLLUTANT EMISSIONS WE STILL HAVE PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS HEALTH CONSEQUENCES WE STILL HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE DYING PREMATURELY. FROM THESE CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT WE ARE DOING WITH ENERGY CONVERSION. AND THEN WE HAVE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WHICH AFFECT OUR CLIMATE AND THESE INCLUDE MANY FROM THE ENERGY CONVERSION LIKE CARBON DIOXIDE METHANE AND NITROUS OXIDE. AND THEN RESOURCE RECOVERY DAMAGE LIKE WE HAVE IN MIND OR REGIONAL RESOURCE DEPLETION THAT LEADS TO GEOPOLITICAL DEPENDENCIES BUT THE ENERGY FUTURE MUST BE MORE DIVERSE AND MORE EQUAL. TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE ACCESS. THIS IS WHAT LEADS TO THOSE GEOPOLITICAL DEPENDENCIES. AND OF COURSE AS I SHOWED EARLIER. HI MERRY ENERGY RESOURCE DEPLETION IS SIMPLY NOT SUSTAINABLE. BUT THERE'S REALLY GOOD NEWS AND THE GOOD NEWS IS FAIRLY RECENT BECAUSE SOLAR AND WIND POWER AND BATTERY COSTS FALL DRAMATICALLY FALLEN IN THE LAST DECADE THEY HAVE FALLEN SO MUCH AS A MATTER OF FACT THAT AS A PRIMARY FORM OF ENERGY THEY'RE THE CHEAPEST. SOLAR AND WIND POWER THE CHEAPEST FORMS OF PRIMARY ENERGY OUT THERE ON THE MARKET TODAY. AND THIS LEADS TO POPULAR THINKING THAT WE SHOULD. MAKE ALL OF OUR POWER FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES INCLUDING SOLAR AND WIND GEOTHERMAL AND OTHERS. AND AS A RESULT USE THAT ALECTRA POWER GENERATION IN ALL END USES. AND USE BATTERIES TO HANDLE THIS INTERMITTENCY ON THE GRID AND FOR AND HOUSTON'S. AND SOME THINK THIS IS ALL WE NEED. SOME ALSO MAKE ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE FACT THAT WE NEED HYDROGEN AND FUEL CELLS THEY SAY SOMETHING LIKE THIS MOST HYDROGEN TODAY IS MADE FROM FSSIL FUELS NATURAL GAS FOR MAKING HYDROGEN FROM WATER AND ELECTRICITY IS LESS EFFICIENT THAN CHARGING A BATTERY OR MAKING ELECTRICITY FROM HYDROGEN AND FUEL CELL IS LESS EFFICIENT THAN A BATTERY SO THAT. THE ROUND TRIP EFFICIENCY OF THE HYDROGEN ENERGY STORAGE TECHNOLOGY IS LOWER THAN A BATTERY. AND THEY ALSO SAY THAT HYDROGEN IS DIFFICULT TO STORE AND MOVE AROUND IN SOCIETY. AND VERY INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE. PEOPLE THAT I ADMIRE- MAKING ALL OF THESE ARGUMENTS. INTERESTINGLY I AGREE WITH MOST OF THE S. HOWEVER. THIS IS SADLY UNTRUTHFUL AND DOESN'T TELL THE WHOLE STORY. WEMUST MAKE CERTAIN SLIGHT MODIFICATIONS TO THE STATEMENTS FOR THAT FOR IT TO TELL THE WHOLE STORY BECAUSE NOT ALL AND USES CAN BE ELECTRIFIED. AND BATTERIES ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO OUR SUSTAINABLE ENERGY FUTURE BUT THEY CAN'T HANDLE ALL OF THE INTERMITTENCY UNDERGRAD. AND THEY CAN'T BE USED FOR ALL AND USES ONLY SOME. AND WHILE THE ROUND TRIP EFFICIENCY IS LESS IN GOING FROM ELECTRICITY TO HYDROGEN BACK TO ELECTRICITY THAN IT IS FOR A BATTERY. IT'S ACTUALLY MORE EFFICIENT IF YOU WANT LONG DURATION STORAGE. AND WHILE HYDROGEN IS MORE DIFFICULT TO MOVE AROUND IN STORE INTO SOCIETY THIS IS ONLY TRUE IF YOU COMPARE IT TO FOSSIL FUELS. IT'S ACTUALLY LIGHTER WEIGHT IN SOME CASES MUCH EASIER TO MOVE ROUND IN SOCIETY THAN BATTERIES FOR EGGS FOR INSTANCE. SO WITH THESE WHITE MODIFICATIONS YOU CAN SEE THAT WE NEED NOT ONLY RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION AND BATTERIES BUT WE NEED RENEWABLE POWER GESTURE GENERATION BATTERIES AND- HYDROGEN AND FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY. AND WE'VE DONE LOTS OF RESEARCH OVER THE YEARS TO SHOW WHY WE NEED THIS AND ONE OF THEM IS SIMPLY THE MAGNITUDE THE AMOUNT OF STORAGE THAT WILL BE REQUIRED FOR A 1100% RENEWABLE GRADING CALIFORNIA. THIS IS A SIMULATION THAT WE DID QUITE A WHILE AGO WHERE WE LOOKED AT THE FIFTEEN MINUTE BY FIFTEEN MINUTE. AVAILABILITY OF SUN AND WIND RESOURCES AND THE DEMAND ON THE ELECTRIC GRID. AND THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WE HAVE PLENTY OF PLACES WHERE WE CAN PUT WINTER AND SUMMER INFLUX SOLAR FARMS SO THAT WE CAN MAKE ENOUGH RENEWABLE ENERGY TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE WHOLE YEAR WE HAVE ENOUGH PRIMARY ENERGY RESOURCES. BUT THE DYNAMICS OF THIS MATTER. IN OTHER WORDS THERE ARE SOME FIFTEEN MINUTE PERIODS SHOWN IN THE READ THE DATA HERE. WHERE THERE IS A DATA SET OF SUN AND WIND POWER COMPARED TO THE DEMAND. THEN THERE ARE OTHER FIFTEEN MINUTE PERIODS WHERE SHOWN IN THE BLUE DATA WE HAVE A SURPLUS OF SUN AND WIND POWER. SO NOW ALL WE NEED TO DO IS JUST STORAGE AND TO MOVE IT AROUND IN SOCIETY SO HOW DO WE DO THAT TODAY WE HAVE A VERY LARGE PUMPED HYDRO SYSTEM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THIS IS SUPER IMPORTANT TO OUR SUSTAINABLE ENERGY FUTURE. IF WE WERE ABLE TO TURN ALL OF THE PUMPS ON AT ONCE OKAY IN OUR COMPUTER SYSTEM WE CAN CONSUME ABOUT NINE GIGAWATTS OF ELECTRICITY THAT'S THE HEIGHT. OF THIS BOX HERE. AND IF WE HAD ALL OF THE UPPER LAKE'S FULL AND WE CAN PUT ALL OF THAT- HYDRODYNAMIC ENERGY THROUGH TURBINES TO MAKE ELECTRICITY WE CAN ACTUALLY RETURN TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT SAME NINE GIGAWATTS FOR ALMOST A MONTH. THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS BOX OF THIS SIZE SO THIS IS A VERY LARGE POWER AND ENERGY CAPABLE. PUMPED HYDRO SYSTEM. BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO ABSORB ALL OF THE SERVICES. AND TO MOVE THEM ALL TO THE DEFICITS SOME PEOPLE SAY WELL LET'S JUST USE OUR BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND USE THOSE TO MOVE THIS ENERGY AROUND AND THIS IS A GOOD IDEA WE CAN MOVE SOME OF IT AROUND- HOW BIG DO YOU THINK THAT'LL BE THE L. IF WE CONVERTED UP ALL TWENTY ONE MILLION OF OUR LIGHT AND MEDIUM DUTY VEHICLES. TO BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES WITH A SIXTY TWO KILOWATT HOUR BATTERY THAT'S THE NISSAN LEAF EQUIVALENT BATTERY. THIS IS A LARGE EIGHT POWER. DEMAND TO GET COULD ABSORB. WHICH IS VERY LARGE ORDER THIRTY GIGAWATTS. ONLY STORES ENOUGH ENERGY FR ABOUT FOUR HOURS. SO THIS ALSO MAY HELP WITH THE SHORT DURATION DYNAMICS BUT REALLY CAN'T MOVE ALL OF THIS ENERGY THAT'S ACCESS IN THE SUMMER TO THE FALL AND WINTER AS IT'S NEEDED. ON THE OTHER HAND IF WE SIMPLY CONVERTED EXISTING GAS STORAGE FACILITIES TO HYDROGEN. THIS IS A LARGE THAT RESOURCE WOULD BE. IT'S THE ONLY RESOURCE THAT IS OF THE MAGNITUDE. THAT THE 1100% RENEWABLE GRID REQUIRES IT'S THE ONLY RESOURCE THAT COULD POSSIBLY TAKE ALL OF THE ACCESS IN ONE SEASON AND DELIVER IT TO THE OTHER SEASONS SO THAT WE CAN MAKE OUR CALIFORNIA GRANT. VERY IMPORTANT AND SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BUT THEY WILL NEVER BE BIG ENOUGH TO GO ALL THE WAY TO A 100% HYDROGEN ON THE OTHER HAND IS. WE DID THIS ANALYSIS ALSO FOR THE ENTIRE WORLD LOOKING AT THE DYNAMICS OF SUN AND WIND IN VARIOUS CONTINENTS OKAY AND VARIOUS AMOUNTS OF SUN AND WIND IN THESE CONTINENTS AND STUDYING THE HOUR BY HOUR AVAILABILITY OF THOSE RESOURCES AND COUPLE THAT TO THE DEMAND DYNAMICS AND WE- ASSESS THE BAN FOR ONE FOR A WORLD TO BECOME THAN TWENTY THOUSAND TERAWATT HOURS OF ENERGY STORAGE. THE VERY BEST BATTERIES IN THE WORLD TODAY ARE MADE WITH LITHIUM AND COBALT THESE ARE WITH THE- ION BATTERIES THIS WOULD REQUIRE MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND MEGATONS OF LITHIUM AND MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED MEGATONS OF COBALT. TO MAKE THE VERY FIRST OKAY BATTERY USING THE BEST BATTERY TECHNOLOGY IN THE WORLD THE BILL THAT ONE BATTERY US TWENTY THOUSAND TERAWATT HOURS. UNFORTUNATELY ON EARTH IF YOU LOOK AT THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE THERE'S ONLY FIFTY THREE MEGATONS OF LITHIUM AND ONLY TWENTY FIVE MEGATONS ON EARTH- ON TERRESTRIAL. LOCATIONS ON EARTH AND MORE THAN A HUNDRED TWENTY MEGATONS ON THE OCEAN FLOOR IF WE DECIDED TO MIND THAT BUT WHAT YOU CAN SEE HERE IS THAT THE WORLD'S VERY BEST BATTERIES. ARE MADE WITH THESE RESOURCES THAT ARE TOTALLY INSUFFICIENT. TO BE USED FOR GRAND SCALE STORAGE. IN ADDITION MORE THAN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO THAT DOESN'T HAVE SUSTAINABLE NON BUSINESS PRACTICES OR CHILD LABOR LAWS. I SUGGEST THAT WE SHOULD USE BATTERIES WHERE THEY MAKE THE MOST SENSE IN LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES AND IN CELLULAR PHONES AND PERSONAL ELECTRONICS THERE IS WHERE WE NEED THEM FOR A SUSTAINABLE ENERGY FUTURE. THERE IS NOT ENOUGH LITHIUM OR COBALT IN THE WORLD TO USE IT FOR THESE MASSIVE STORAGE REQUIREMENTS OF A TOTALLY RENEWABLE GRID. SH ADDITION BATTERIES ARE SUPER EFFICIENT IF YOU SH STORE ENERGY FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THIS IS DATA FROM THE CALIFORNIA'S SELF GENERATION INCENTIVE PROGRAM ADVANCED ENERGY STORAGE PROJECTS- AND WHAT YOU CAN SEE. IS THE ROUND TRIP EFFICIENCY THAT'S WHAT'S PLOTTED HERE VERSUS THE CAPACITY FACTOR AND CAPACITY FACTORS ESSENTIALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THAT TIME. BETWEEN THE CHARGING AND DISCHARGING OKAY SO IF YOU HAVE A HIGH CAPACITY FACTOR THAT MEANS YOU'RE CHARGED. LET'S SAY ONE DAY AND THE VERY NEXT EVENING YOU JUST CHARGE. SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT IF YOU HAVE A LOW CAPACITY FACTOR THAT MEANS YOU CHARGE ONE DAY YOU STARTED FOR A WEEK AND THEN YOU JUST TARGET FOR EVEN LONGER THAN THAT. WHAT YOU CAN SEE HERE S THAT THE AVERAGE OF THESE GRANTS SIZED UTILITY APPLICATIONS OF BATTERY SYSTEMS IS THE AVERAGE ROUNDTRIP EFFICIENCY IS AROUND 60% AND THIS IS PRIMARILY DUE TO SELF DISCHARGE SOMETHING WE ARE FAMILIAR WITH FROM THE BATTERIES WE USE IN OUR CELL PHONES OR IN OUR CARS WE KNOW THAT IF WE DON'T USE IT FOR QUITE AWHILE IT DISCHARGES. AND THIS IS BECAUSE THE STORAGE MEDIUM IS AN INTIMATE CONTACT WITH THE ELECTRODES AND THERE'S NO WAY OF. EVENTING COMPLETELY PSALM DISCHARGE. AND THIS IS WHY WHEN IT COMES TO LONG DURATION STORAGE BATTERIES ARE NOT WELL SUITED TO THIS HYDROGEN IS BETTER SUITED TO THE MASSIVE AND LONG DURATION STORAGE THAT WE NEED AT THAT UTILITY SCALE. AND THE DYNAMICS WORK VERY WELL FOR HYDROGEN THIS IS RESEARCH THAT WE DID QUITE A WHILE AGO LOOKING AT TEXAS WIND YOU CAN SEE THE WIND DYNAMICS THAT ARE SHOWN HERE WHEN I TRY TO GET A POINTER. GOING YOU CAN SEE THE WIND DYNAMICS AND GREEN HERE AND YOU CAN SEE THE DEMAND DYNAMICS OF AN ADJACENT TOWN IN MAGENTA AND THEN YOU CAN SEE WHENEVER THERE IS ACCESS WIND WE CAN PUT IT THROUGH AN ELECTROLYZER AND MAKE RENEWABLE HYDROGEN FROM THAT ACCESS GRANTED WHENEVER THERE'S A DEFICIT OF WHEN WE ACTUALLY TAKE THE HYDROGEN OUT OF THE SALT CAVERN THAT WE STARTED IN AND PUT IT THROUGH A FUEL CELL SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY MEET THE DEMAND OF THIS ADJACENT CITY- AT EVERY HOUR OF THE YEAR THIS IS JUST SHOWING ONE WEEK IN OCTOBER. WE FOUND THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY MANAGE THE PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE DYNAMICS IN THE SALT CAVERN WHERE RESTORING ALL THE HYDROGEN TO. BELOW MAXIMUM AN ABOVE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS. IF YOU LOOK AT IT FOR THE WHOLE YEAR SHOWN HERE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE YOU CAN SEE THAT OUR BY OUR MINUTE BY MINUTE. AND EVEN MONTH BY MONTH WE ARE ABLE TO STORE WINDPOWER AND COUPLE IT COMPLETELY TO THE ENERGY DEMAND IN THIS CITY IN TEXAS YOU CAN SEE HERE THAT ACCESS OVERALL. WIN POWER IN OCTOBER NOVEMBER DECEMBER JANUARY FEBRUARY MARCH. IS ACTUALLY RETURNED PRIMARILY IN JULY AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER TO THAT COMMUNITY. SO YOU CAN SEE WE CAN DO THE HOUR BY HOUR AND SEASONAL. COMPLEMENTING OF WIND POWER TO THE DEMAND SO WHAT WE DON'T HAVE A SALT CAVERN. WELL I SUGGEST THAT WE HAVE UNDERGROUND STORAGE TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM TODAY THAT CAN BE CONVERTED WITH SOME INVESTMENT TO- STORE AND DISTRIBUTE THIS VALUABLE RESOURCE AS A MATTER OF FACT RECENT STUDIES BY THE GAS TECHNOLOGY INSTITUTE SUGGESTS THAT THE RELIABILITY OF THIS UNDERGROUND INFRASTRUCTURE IS MORE THAN FIVE NINES THROUGHOUT THE NATION. SO HYDROGEN IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT FOR RESILIENCY. FOR MASSIVE STORAGE AND FOR TRANSMISSION DISTRIBUTION ESPECIALLY IN PLACES LIKE CALIFORNIA WHERE WE ALREADY HAVE CHALLENGES WITH MOVING ALL OF OUR ENERGY THROUGH- FROM THE DESERT AND- BORDER AREAS INTO URBAN AREAS WE HAVE CHALLENGES WITH WILDFIRES GET CHALLENGES WITH S. P. S. P. S. EVENTS THAT CAN BE HELPED BY AN INVESTMENT IN THE TRANSFORMATION OF OUR GAS SYSTEM. AND IT IS A MASSIVE RESOURCE AS A MATTER OF FACT. THIRTEEN TERAWATT HOURS OF EQUIVALENT ELECTRICITY STORAGE CAN BE ACCOMMODATED JUST IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SERVICE TERRITORY THIS IS WORTH TWO POINT SIX TRILLION DOLLARS AT FUTURE BATTERY COST. EVEN IF WE JUST IJECTED 5% HIGHER CHEN INTO THE NATURAL GAS THIS IS AN EQUIVALENT STORAGE SYSTEM THAT WOULD BE WORTH ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS IN DEALING FUTURE BATTERY COSTS. THIS IS SUCH A LARGE STORAGE AND TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION RESOURCE. THAT EVEN JUST 5% OF IT. IS THIS VALUABLE HOW THESE NUMBERS ARE SO BIG IN MY MIND I HAVE A HARD TIME BECAUSE- MATCHING WHAT HOW BIG THEY ARE SO I COMPARED IT TO SOMETHING I KNOW MORE ABOUT LIKE. THE TUITION AND FEES AT UC IRVINE AND WE COULD SEND THE ENTIRE ORANGE COUNTY POPULATION MORE THAN TWO POINT TWO MILLION PEOPLE. TO FOUR YEARS OF THE ENTIRE POPULATION IT WOULD ONLY COST THIRTY NINE BILLION DOLLARS OR WE CAN MAKE ALL UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS FREE TO EVERYONE AND EVERY FOUR YEARS WE ONLY HAVE TO COME UP WITH A FOUR POINT SEVEN BILLION. SOME SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. TRANSFORMING THE GAS SYSTEM TO JUST ACCEPT 5% HYDROGEN. OKAY WOULD BE WORSE A HUNDRED AND THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS. THE INTERESTING OF WHICH WOULD EASILY PAY FOR ALL OF THIS. IT'S EXTREMELY VALUABLE TO OUR RESILIENT AND ZERO EMISSIONS FUTURE. AND FUEL CELL SYSTEMS OPERATING OFF OF GAS DELIVERED AN UNDERGROUND GAS UNDERGROUND GAS SYSTEM HAVE PROVEN THIS RESILIENCE THROUGH ALL SORTS OF NATURAL DISASTERS LIKE THE SAN DIEGO BLACKOUT THAT OCCURRED IN TWENTY ELEVEN WINTER STORMS IN THE NORTHEAST EARTHQUAKES LIKE THE NAPA EARTHQUAKE IN CALIFORNIA RECENTLY. OR THE RIDGECREST EARTHQUAKE EVEN MORE RECENTLY THE MANHATTAN BLACKED OUT JAPANESE SUPER TYPHOONS HUNDREDS OF EXAMPLES OF THIS BEING PROVEN BY THE GAS SYSTEM AND FUEL CELLS. WE ALSO NEED HYDROGEN FOR OTHER THINGS AND I WAS VERY FORTUNATE TO WORK WITH SOME AWESOME SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS LED BY MY COLLEAGUE STEVE DAVIS HERE AND WE FORTUNATELY WE WERE LOOKING AT HOW DO WE MAKE THE ENTIRETY OF OUR ENERGY SYSTEM ZERO EMISSIONS. AND HYDROGEN PLAYS A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN MANY OF THESE THINGS OF COURSE WE NEED PRIMARY SUN AND WIND ENERGY BUT WE ALSO NEED THINGS THAT DEPEND UPON HYDROGEN LIKE THE PRODUCTION OF AMMONIA. OR THE PRODUCTION OF AVIATION OR TRANSPORTATION LIQUID FUELS ABOUT CEMENT AND STEEL OR HOW ABOUT MAKING HOSPITALS AS RESILIENT AS POSSIBLE THESE KINDS OF THINGS NEED THE FEATURES. THAT HYDROGEN PROVIDES OF COURSE IN ADDITION TO INVESTMENTS IN SOLAR WIND BATTERIES ETCETERA. AND IN PARTICULAR WHEN IT COMES TO FUELS THERE ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO ELECTRIFY AND USES. SOME OF OUR SHOWN HERE LIKE FUEL CELL BUSES OR SHIPS OR AIRCRAFT OR LONG HAUL TRUCKS OR TRAINS. LITERALLY ANYTHING THAT WOULD REQUIRE RAPID FUELING OR LONG RANGE OR LARGE PAYLOAD IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR TENDS TO PREFER ZERO EMISSIONS WITH HYDROGEN. TWO ZERO EMISSIONS WITH BATTERIES YEAH BOTH OF THESE ARE IMPORTANT BUT IF YOU NEED THESE FEATURES HYDROGEN WILL BE PREFERRED FOR ZERO EMISSIONS. THERE ARE MANY INDUSTRIAL END USES LIKE STEEL CEMENT PLASTICS PHARMACEUTICALS CHIP. COMPUTER CHIP FABRICATION OR A MILLION FERTILIZER PRODUCTION AND MANY OTHERS THAT CANNOT BE ELECTRIFIED BECAUSE OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR HEAT OR FEEDSTOCK OR REDUCING GAS THIS CAN BE DELIVERED ON THE OTHER HAND BY HYDROGEN. AND THEN WE COME TO THE COLORS OF HYDROGEN. WELL FIRST OF ALL THERE'S NO ACCEPTED OR AGREED TO STANDARD ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. I'VE PUT TOGETHER AN EXAMPLE HERE OF. MANY COLORS OF HYDROGEN THAT PEOPLE ARE SUGGESTING AND WHILE THIS MIGHT MAKE FOR A COLORFUL RAINBOW. I SUGGEST THAT PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS INHIBITS WHAT WE DESIRE. IMAGE THE MARKET INVESTMENT AND OFTEN IT LEADS TO UNEXPECTED NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES. OFTEN INCREASING EMISSIONS RATHER THAN DECREASING THEM AS WE DESIRE. SO I STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT WE DO NOT ESTABLISH THIS SORT OF A COLOR PREFERENCE BUT RATHER USE ALREADY ESTABLISHED MEANS OF ASSESSING CARBON UNTESTED INTENSITY OR ASSESSING THE EMISSIONS IMPACTS THIS IS THE METRIC THAT WE SHOULD USE FOR ASSESSING WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE DOING SOMETHING DESIRABLE BY ADOPTING HYDROGEN. ONE AND WITH TWO THINGS THAT WE THAT THAT WE HAVE ANALYZED IN SOME DEGREE OF DETAIL HERE ONE OF THEM IS CAN WE MAKE THE PORT OF LA LONG BEACH COMPLETELY ZERO EMISSIONS. AND WE LOOKED AT BATTERY SAYS ONE OF THE SOLUTION AND HYDROGEN IS ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS FOR THE SHIPS FOR EXAMPLE WHAT YOU'RE SEEING HERE IS THE PERCENT OF ORIGINAL CARGO SPACE AND THAT TONNAGE THAT A HYDROGEN OPTION AND A BATTERY OPTION COULD ENGENDER AND IT'S VERY APPLAUDED VERSES THE SHIP'S SIZE IN THOUSANDS OF TWENTY FOOT EQUIVALENT UNITS OKAY SO YOU CAN SEE THIS IS ONE THOUSAND TWO YEAR AND ASSIST THIRTEEN THOUSAND TWO YEAR. AND WHEN YOU CAN SEE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY IS THAT THE BATTERY CASES ARE SEVERELY DIMINISHED AND FOR THE MOST PART HAVE HARDLY ANY TONNAGE THAT'S LEFT ONCE YOU OUTFIT THEM WITH BATTERIES IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO MAKE SHIPS ZERO EMISSION WITH BATTERIES ON THE OTHER HAND BOTH HYDROGEN GASTRIN IN THE GREEN DATA AND HYDROGEN LIQUID SHOWN IN THE READ DATA. HAVE SUFFICIENT VOLUME IN TONNAGE TO MAKE IT FEASIBLE AS A MATTER OF FACT IN PARTICULAR IN THE LIQUID HYDROGEN CASES 1100% OF THE ORIGINAL CUT TO CARGO SPACE AND TONNAGE IS ALMOST EXACTLY ATTAINABLE WITH A HYDROGEN. SHIP OPTION. AND THEN YOU CAN TAKE THOSE SHIPS OVER GREAT DISTANCES THIS IS LIKE SEVENTEEN THOUSAND NAUTICAL MILES AND YOU CAN SEE HERE THE CARGO THAT IS ABLE TO BE TAKEN BY HYDROGEN CHIPS. CAN YOU GO CAN CAN GO A LONG WAYS AND CAN STILL BE ORDER OF MAGNITUDE THE SAME AMOUNT OF CARGO THAT WERE CUT CARRYING TODAY. AND IF WE DID THIS AND WE TOOK ALL THE SHIPS ALL THE TRAINS ALL THE TRUCKS. EIGHT POINT NINE MILLION TONS OF HYDROGEN TO BE GENERATED EVERY YEAR SO CAN WE MAKE THAT MUCH TIGHTER JOHN. ISNER FACT WE'VE ANALYZED JUST OFFSHORE WIND AND JUST THREE OFFSHORE WIND FARMS IN THESE LOCATIONS AND THE COST OF THIS OFFSHORE WIND IS COMING DOWN VERY SUBSTANTIALLY COULD MAKE. ALL OF THAT HYDROGEN EVERY YEAR. THIS IS A VISION FOR THE FUTURE THAT CANNOT BE ENGENDERED. WITHOUT HYDROGEN. WINDPOWER IN THREE LARGE WIND FARMS CAN MAKE THE ENTIRETY OF THE L. A. LONG BEACH COURT ZERO EMISSIONS. WE'VE ALSO BEEN LOOKING A LOT OF DATA CENTERS RECENTLY AND- HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF DATA CENTERS THAT WE ANALYZED TO PRODUCE ALL OF THE PRIMARY ENERGY FROM SUN AND WIND AND TO USE BATTERIES OR POWER TO GAS- IN VARIOUS CONFIGURATIONS TO MEET THE DEMAND DYNAMICS IN VARIOUS LOCATIONS TWO. AND THESE ARE THE MODELING ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE MADE AND YOU CAN SEE HERE WE DO INDEED HAVE LOWER ROUND TRIP EFFICIENCY FOR THE HYDROGEN CASES THAN WE DO FOR THE BATTERY CASES. AND WE HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR LIQUEFACTION WHEN WE MAKE HYDROGEN AT SUCH A LARGE SCALE THE SCALE THAT DATA CENTERS REQUIRE AND SO IT TAKES A LOT OF ENERGY AND IT ALSO HAS SOME BOIL OFF LOSSES WHICH WE ACCOUNT FOR. BUT IF AND WE CAN ALSO OPTIMIZE THESE SO FOR EXAMPLE WE CAN OPTIMIZE IT FOR IT FOR THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF ENERGY FROM THE SUN AND WHEN IT GOES TO THE DATA CENTER DIRECTLY. REACHING 81% THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT IT IS. BUT WE STILL NEED QUITE A BIT OF STORAGE IS NOT EFFECTIVE WE INSTALL MORE SOLAR AND WIND POWER THEN WE HAVE A SMALLER ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEM WE CAN OPTIMIZE FOR THAT TOO. BUT WE WANT TO OPTIMIZE FOR THE LOWEST CAPACITY INSTALLED WE HAVE TO PICK MOSTLY MEN OUR- SO ALL OF THESE WE'VE ANALYZED. AND IN EVERY SINGLE CASE WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT THESE WERE LOOKING AT THE LEVELIZED COST OF ELECTRICITY DELIVERED TO THE DATA CENTER. REMEMBER THIS IS FOR A 100% RENEWABLE ACCOUNTING FOR ALL OF THE STORAGE ALL OF THE LOSSES. FOR GETTING THROUGH THE ENTIRETY OF A YEAR- AND DELIVERING THIS- ELECTRICITY TO THE DATA CENTER AND WE CAN SEE WE HAVE TO INSTALL A LOT MORE WIND AND- SOLAR P. V. IN THE HYDROGEN CASE BECAUSE OF THAT LOWER ROUND TRIP EFFICIENCY. BUT BECAUSE OF SEPARATE POWER AND ENERGY SCALING FEATURES. AND BECAUSE OF. THE HUGE MAGNITUDE OF STORAGE THAT'S REQUIRED FOR THE C. HYDROGEN CASES ARE ALWAYS. VERY MUCH MARK EFFECTIVE SHOWING HERE ON AND TWENTY DOLLARS MEGAWATT HOUR VERSUS ALMOST FULL THOUSAND DOLLARS PER HOUR FOR THE BATTER CASE EVERYTHING CASE THAT WE LOOKED AT 4100% RENEWABLE WITH ALL THE STORAGE. INCLUDED IS CHEAPER WHEN WE GO THE HYDROGEN ROUTE. THE DOCTOR LIMB INTERRUPTING IT GIVE YOU A ONE MINUTE FOR CLOSING AND WILL CONTINUE WITH THE OTHER PANELISTS YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO I WASN'T ABLE TO DISCUSS ALL OF THE FEATURES THAT HYDROGEN CAN PROVIDE BUT WE WROTE A PAPER ON THIS AND I HAVEN'T REFERENCED HERE- HYDROGEN OFFERS SOME INTERESTING AND UNIQUE FEATURES AS A ZERO EMISSIONS FACTOR. THAT ARE GOING TO BE REQUIRED FOR A 100% RENEWABLE AND ZERO EMISSIONS FACTOR- ZERO EMISSIONS ECONOMY. I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU DOCTOR WILL HAVE A QUESTIONS YEAR AFTER THE- YES SPEAKER SO LET'S GO ON AND- ONCE AGAIN DR BOWERS DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL FUEL CELL RESEARCH CENTER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE. AND THANK YOU DOCTOR FOR YOUR TESTIMONY NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD- MISTER ANDREW MARTINEZ AND YOU HAVE FIFTEEN MINUTES SIR. PLEASE WELCOME AND- THE FLOOR IS YOURS. ARE YOU ALL ABLE TO SEE MY SCREEN. WITH THE PRESENTATION. YES THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU CHARGE A LETTER PROVIDING HERE TODAY TO PROVIDE THIS UPDATE ON CALIFORNIA'S LIGHT DUTY HYDROGEN STATION NETWORK DEVELOPMENT AND CARDS ANALYSES OF PROGRESS TO DATE AND OUTLOOK FOR THE FUTURE. THERE ARE HUGE OPPORTUNITIES FOR HYDROGEN AND THE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY SECTORS BUT THIS PRESENTATION TODAY IS FOCUSED ON THE LIGHT DUTY SECTOR. FOR MANY YEARS CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A GLOBAL LEADER IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF HYDROGEN FUELING STATION NETWORK DEVELOPMENT. AND FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLE DEPLOYMENT. IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THROUGH ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT THE LEGISLATURE ESTABLISHED A TARGET OF AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED PUBLICLY AVAILABLE HYDROGEN FILLING STATIONS. THAT BILL ENABLES FUNDING FOR AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED STATIONS IN OPERATION CALIFORNIA. OR UNTIL THE ENERGY COMMISSION IN CONSULTATION WITH KERR. FINDS THAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS ESTABLISHING SUCH STATIONS WITHOUT THE NEED FOR PUBLIC SUPPORT. GOVERNOR BROWN THEN ESTABLISHED A SECOND TARGET IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO EXECUTIVE ORDER B. FORTY EIGHT EIGHTEEN. THAT WATER SET A TARGET OF TWO HUNDRED HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. ALONG WITH OTHER TARGETS FOR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE DEPLOYMENT AND CHARGING NETWORK DEVELOPMENT. CALIFORNIA STRATEGY INCORPORATES FINANCIAL AND NON FINANCIAL SUPPORT MECHANISMS TO ACHIEVE THESE CHARGING STATION NETWORK DEVELOPMENT GOALS SUPPORT THE CONSTRUCTION OPERATION OF HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS. AND PROVIDE ANALYSIS AND GUIDANCE FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE EFFORTS. THROUGH THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM EXTENDED BY AB EIGHT THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION PROVIDES UP TO TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR NOT TO EXCEED 20% OF PROGRAM FUNDING AND COMPETITIVE GRANTS TO CO FUND THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIGHT DUTY HYDROGEN FILLING STATIONS UNTIL JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. ADDITIONALLY CARBS LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD PROGRAM PROVIDES TWO MECHANISMS TO SUPPORT THE OPERATIONS OF HYDROGEN FILLING STATIONS. AS IS THE CASE WITH OTHER ALTERNATIVE FUELS HYDROGEN STATION OPERATORS MAY GENERATE CREDITS IN THE PROGRAM ON THE BASIS OF SALES OF HYDROGEN FUEL. IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE LTFS REGULATION WAS AMENDED TO INCLUDE A SECOND PATHWAY THAT ALLOWS STATION OPERATORS TO GENERATE ADDITIONAL CREDITS UP TO THE CAPACITY OF EACH STATION. FOR A LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME AND WITHIN CERTAIN LIMITATIONS. THIS PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITY FOR REVENUE THAT CAN SUPPORT STATION OPERATIONS WHILE FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLE DEPLOYMENT GROWS OVER TIME. IN ADDITION TO THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT MECHANISMS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PROVIDES SEVERAL NON FINANCIAL SUPPORT PROGRAMS. TESTING THAT EVALUATES HYDROGEN STATION FEELING PROTOCOLS ACCURATE METERING AND FEEL PURITY ARE CARRIED OUT BY STAFF AT CARD AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE'S DIVISION OF MEASUREMENT STANDARDS. THESE PROGRAMS PROVIDE VALUE BY ENSURING THAT STATIONS OPERATE AS EXPECTED ACCORDING TO INDUSTRY ACCEPTED STANDARDS. PROVIDE POSITIVE FEELING EXPERIENCES FOR FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLE DRIVERS. THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OR GO BIDS ALSO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO STATION DEVELOPERS AND HAVE DEVELOPED A PERMITTING GUIDEBOOK. UNDER ABA CARBONI ENERGY COMMISSION ALSO PROVIDE ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION OF PROGRESS IN NETWORK DEVELOPMENT AND FUEL CELL VEHICLE DEPLOYMENT. POTENTIAL FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS AND ASSESSMENT OF NEEDS. THE FIRST RETAIL HYDROGEN STATION IN CALIFORNIA BEGAN OPERATIONS IN WEST SACRAMENTO IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. SINCE THEN THE NETWORK HAS EXPANDED WITH MAJOR CLUSTERS OF HYDROGEN FILLING STATIONS IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA AROUND THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA AND IN ORANGE AND LOS ANGELES COUNTY. ADDITIONAL STATIONS ARE LOCATED IN SAN DIEGO RIVERSIDE SANTA BARBARA AND TRUCKEE NEAR LAKE TAHOE. STATION KALANGA SERVES A VITAL ROLE IN ENABLING TRAVEL BETWEEN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN HALVES OF THE STATE. TODAY CALIFORNIA'S HYDROGEN FUELING STATION NETWORK CONSISTS OF FIFTY TWO TOTAL STATIONS THAT ARE CAPABLE OF RETAIL HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS WITH FORTY EIGHT OF THESE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC. THESE STATIONS ARE SHOWN ON THE MAP ON THE RIGHT WHICH ALSO HIGHLIGHTS THE STATIONS THAT HAVE OPENED SINCE CARD PUBLISHED IT'S TWENTY TWENTY. ANNUAL EVALUATION OF HYDROGEN STATION NETWORK DEVELOPMENT AND FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLE DEPLOYMENT. NEARLY EVERYONE OF THESE STATIONS HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM. MOST ALSO PARTICIPATE IN THE AVAILABLE CREDIT GENERATION OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD. UP TO AN ADDITIONAL ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN STATIONS ARE EITHER CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION OR PLANNED FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT. UP TO ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY STATIONS HAVE BEEN POTENTIALLY AWARDED GRANTS FOR CONSTRUCTION UNDER THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM. NINETY FOUR OF WHICH WERE RECENTLY AWARDED THE ENERGY COMMISSION'S LATEST MULTI YEAR GRANT SOLICITATION GFO NINETEEN SIX OH TWO. SOME ARE CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT WHILE OTHERS ARE PENDING FUTURE ALLOCATIONS FOR CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM INVESTMENT PLANS. GRANTS ARE ALSO AWARDED TO UPGRADE STATION CAPACITY UP FOR EXISTING HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS. THE STATION FASSIE UPGRADES ARE NECESSARY BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN SOME LOCAL STATIONS WITH HIGH DEMAND EVEN THOUGH THE OVERALL NETWORK CAPACITY EXCEEDS USE AT THIS POINT. AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY THREE STATIONS ARE EITHER CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION OR PLANNED FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT THROUGH COMPLETELY PRIVATE FUNDING. CARD STAFF EXPECT MOST IF NOT ALL OF THESE STATIONS WILL ALSO PARTICIPATE IN THE AVAILABLE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD PROVISIONS. CARBONELL SAYS FIND THAT 75% OF THE CURRENTLY OPEN OR PLANNED FEELING THAT WORK WOULD BE WITHIN A SIX MINUTE DRIVE OF A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY PROVIDING SIMILAR CONVENIENCE TO HYDROGEN FUELING. AS TODAY'S GASOLINE NETWORK FOR THESE COMMUNITIES. ANALYSIS OF FINER SCALE FIND AT APPROXIMATELY ONE THIRD OF BOTH CALIFORNIA'S GENERAL AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY POPULATIONS. LIVE WITHIN THIS COMMITTEE CONVENIENCE SIX MINUTE DRIVE OF AN OPEN OR PLANNED HYDROGEN STATION. STATION TECHNOLOGY CAPABILITIES HAVE EVOLVED SINCE THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM BEGAN IN TWENTY THIRTEEN. EARLY STATIONS ARE MOSTLY SMALL WITH THE ABILITY TO FEEL APPROXIMATELY FORTY FIVE VEHICLES PER DAY. EARLY STATIONS ALSO TYPICALLY INCLUDED ONLY ONE DISPENSER SO ONLY ABLE TO FEEL A SINGLE VEHICLE AT A TIME. STATIONS BEING BUILT TODAY ARE NOW ABLE TO VIEW AS MANY AS FOUR HUNDRED VEHICLES IN A DAY AND INCLUDE DISPENSERS I CAN FEEL UP TO FOUR INDIVIDUAL VEHICLES SIMULTANEOUSLY. THE STATION CAN PROVIDE A MORE POSITIVE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND ENABLE IMPROVEMENTS IN MANAGING STATION OPERATIONS. CALIFORNIA'S HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS SUPPORT PROGRAMS ARE MAKING SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS TOWARDS MEETING THE GOALS OF AB EIGHT AN EXECUTIVE ORDER B. FORTY EIGHT EIGHTEEN. IN TOTAL THE CURRENTLY OPEN AND PLANNED NETWORK INCLUDES NEARLY ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS. WHEN ALL THE STATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS ARE COMPLETE CALIFORNIA'S HYDROGEN FUELING NETWORK WILL HAVE A SUFFICIENT CAPACITY. TO SUPPORT A POPULATION OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES ON THE ROAD. THIS PUTS CALIFORNIA'S HYDROGEN STATION NETWORK DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ON TRACK TO MEET THE ONE HUNDRED STATION MILESTONE ESTABLISHED IN EIGHTY EIGHT. DUE TO THE LEGISLATURE HAS RECENTLY PASSED ONE TIME FUNDING C. EASY WILL BE ABLE TO CLOSE A RECENTLY IDENTIFIED SMALL GAP. TO ACHIEVING THE TWO HUNDRED STATION TARGET. HYDROGEN FUELING STATION NETWORK DEVELOPMENT IN CALIFORNIA HAS NOW SPENT SEVERAL YEARS IN MULTIPLE GRANT SOLICITATIONS WITHIN THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM. THE FELICITATION SEVEN VANCE THE HYDROGEN FUELING NETWORK FROM THE RESEARCH AND DEMONSTRATION PHASE. THREE PRE COMMERCIAL TRANSITION AND NOW INTO COMMERCIAL SCALE. AT THE NETWORKING INDUSTRY HAS EVOLVED SO HAVE CARDS ANALYSES OF NEEDS AND STATION REQUIREMENTS AND GRANT SOLICITATIONS. INCLUDING CRITERIA FOR DETERMINING NEW STATION LOCATIONS. AN ALL STATE SUPPORT PROGRAMS STATION DEVELOPER SELECTED LOCATIONS THEY WISH TO PROPOSE. AND PRIOR GRANT SOLICITATIONS DAY STOP LIST THE VERY FIRST HYDROGEN THAT ESTABLISHED A VERY FIRST HYDROGEN STATIONS IN CALIFORNIA. REQUIREMENTS FOR STATION LOCATION WHERE MORE PRESCRIPTIVE TO ENSURE THAT STATIONS WILL BE BUILT IN APPLICATIONS THAT PROVIDE CONVENIENT FEELING OPTIONS FOR THE LARGEST POTENTIAL FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLE ADOPTER MARKET. GIVEN THE GROWTH IN THE STATE'S HYDROGEN FUELING NETWORK AND A DESIRE TO FOSTER ADVANCEMENTS AND ECONOMIES OF SCALE WITHIN THE HYDROGEN STATION INDUSTRY. THE LATEST GRANT SOLICITATION ADOPTED A LESS PRESCRIPTIVE STRATEGY FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON STATION CAPACITY. THUS THE LOCATIONS OF UP TO SIXTY SIX OF THE STATIONS THAT WILL BE DEVELOPED THROUGH THE LATEST ROUND OF CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM FUNDING. HAVE NOT YET BEEN DETERMINED. LOS STATION DEVELOPERS ARE FREE TO PROPOSED STATIONS ACROSS MUCH OF THE STATE LARGER STATIONS ARE REQUIRED IN AREAS THAT HAVE ESTABLISHED AN INITIAL LOSS ON THAT LOCAL NETWORK. AND ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE THE LARGEST LOCAL FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLE MARKETS. AT A MULTI YEAR GRANT PROGRAM STATION DEVELOPERS WILL IDENTIFY LOCATIONS IN SUCCESSIVE BATCHES WITH GUIDANCE PROVIDED BY CARDS ANALYSIS OF NEEDS FOR FUTURE NETWORK GROWTH. IT'S A VALUATION IS BASED ON TOOLS DEVELOPED A CAR THAT WILL BE DISCUSSED IN THE FOLLOWING FLIGHT. THE MAP ON THE RIGHT SHOWS THE ANALYSIS ACCORDING TO THIS NEW CAPACITY BASED STRATEGY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SOLICITATION. THE MAP CATEGORIZES AREAS ACCORDING TO THE CURRENT LOCAL NETWORK DEVELOPMENT AND POTENTIAL NEED FOR HIGH CAPACITY STATIONS. STATION DEVELOPERS PROPOSING STATIONS IN AREAS WITH AN ORANGE COLOR DENOTED CAPACITY GROWTH ARE ENCOURAGED TO DEVELOP HIGH CAPACITY STATIONS. THESE ARE CURRENTLY LOCATED IN WESTERN LOS ANGELES NEAR IRVINE AND SAN FRANCISCO AND IN THE SOUTHEAST PORTION OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREAS NEAR SAN JOSE MOUNTAIN VIEW PALO ALTO AND OTHER NEARBY COMMUNITIES. AS NEWS STATIONS ARE PROPOSED BY AUTHORITIES TO FUTURE PHASES OF CONSTRUCTION KARBALA JUSTICE EVALUATION AND MORE AREAS WILL BE IDENTIFIED WITH REQUIREMENTS FOR HIGH CAPACITY STATIONS. UNDER AB EIGHT THE CARD IS DIRECTED TO ANNUALLY PROVIDE AN ANALYSIS OF NEEDS FOR FUTURE STATION LOCATIONS CONSIDERING THE TWO METRICS OF COVERAGE AND CAPACITY. COVERAGE DESCRIBES THE DEGREE OF CONVENIENT ACCESS TO HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS THAT POTENTIAL FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLE DRIVERS HAPPEN NEIGHBORHOODS ACROSS THE STATE. CAPACITY ANALYSIS EVALUATES THE TOTAL FEELING CAPACITY OF AVAILABLE HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS COMPARED TO THE ESTIMATED LOCAL FUELING DEMAND A FUTURE FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLE DRIVERS. AND TWENTY FIFTEEN CARD FIRST PUBLISHED ITS GEOSPATIAL ANALYSIS TOOL THAT WAS DEVELOPED SPECIFICALLY TO EVALUATE THE METRICS OF COVERAGE AND CAPACITY FOR COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. THIS TOOL WAS THEN FURTHER UPDATE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND AGAIN EARLIER THIS YEAR AND HAS BEEN UTILIZED IN ALL ANNUAL EVALUATIONS PER ABA PUBLISHED BY CARD SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN. THE TO IDENTIFIED GAPS IN CAPACITY COVERAGE AND CAPACITY BY COMPARING THE COVERAGE AND CAPACITY PROVIDED BY THE OPEN FUNDED. OPEN UNFUNDED HYDROGEN FUELING NETWORK. TO AN EVALUATION OF FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLE ADOPTER MARKET. IN ALICE'S ALSO COMPARES NETWORK COVERAGE TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES. THE TOOL IDENTIFIES AREAS WHERE NEW STATIONS ARE MOST NEEDED BY FINDING THE LARGEST MISALIGNMENT BETWEEN THE FUEL CELL ADOPTER MARKET NEEDS AND THE COVERAGE AND CAPACITY PROVIDED BY THE HYDROGEN FUELING NETWORK. THE MAP ON THE RIGHT EXPLAINS CARDS MOST RECENT DRAFT EVALUATION OF COVERAGE ACCOUNTING FOR ALL STATIONS KNOWN TO BE CURRENTLY OPEN AND UNDER DEVELOPMENT OR PLANNED FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT. THE TANK OUTLINED IN THE FIGURE IDENTIFIED THE AREAS WHERE ADDITIONAL STATIONS ARE CURRENTLY MOST NEEDED IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH OR FURTHER ENHANCE FEELING ACCESS. FOR POTENTIAL FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLE DOCTORS. THIS LATEST ANALYSIS FROM CARD STAFF HIGHLIGHTS THAT THERE CONTINUES TO BE OPPORTUNITY FOR EXPANDED NETWORK GROWTH IN PARTS OF SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA LOS ANGELES AND ORANGE COUNTY FOR HYDROGEN STATIONS CURRENTLY OPERATE. IN ADDITION PRIORITIES EXIST IN AREAS AND OTHER MARKETS ACROSS THE STATE INCLUDING SANJAY SAN DIEGO THE CENTRAL COAST THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY RIVERSIDE AND SAN BERNARDINO COUNTIES IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE. TODAY THREE MODELS ARE AVAILABLE WHICH ARE SHOWN THROUGHOUT THE VEHICLES ARE AVAILABLE WHICH ARE SHOWN ON THE SLIDE. THESE INCLUDE THE TOYOTA MIRAI HONDA CLARITY AND HYUNDAI NEXT SO. ALTHOUGH HONDA WILL STOP SELLING THE CLARITY AT THE END OF THIS MODEL YEAR THEY CONTINUE DEVELOPMENT ON THE NEXT FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLE MODEL FOR FUTURE RELEASE. AT LEAST TWO OTHER AUTO MANUFACTURERS HAVE RECENTLY ANNOUNCED INTENT TO DEVELOP AND MARKET THEIR OWN FUEL CELL ELECTRIC EHICLE. BASED ON DATA PROVIDED BY THE ENERGY COMMISSION SENT DASHBOARD THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY ONE HUNDRED FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES DRIVING ON CALIFORNIA'S ROADS BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY. BASED ON THE LATEST SURVEY ABOUT A MANUFACTURER PLANS FOR FUTURE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE SALES IN CALIFORNIA THE IN STATE FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLE POPULATION IS PROJECTED TO CONTINUE TO GROW. AND ACCELERATE DEPLOYMENT IN THE NEAR TERM. SURVEY RESULTS INDICATE THIRTY ONE THOUSAND FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES COULD BE ON THE ROAD IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND SIXTY ONE THOUSAND AND TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN. THE RECENT COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAD A NOTICEABLE ACT IMPACT ON FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLE SALES BUT INDUSTRY PROVIDED SALES DATA THROUGH THE FIRST FIVE MONTHS OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. INDICATE THAT SALES HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES. THE OTHER DAY IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE ARE ARE ALREADY 83% OF SALES FOR ALL OF TWENTY NINETEEN. THE FIRST QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WAS ALSO THE BEST SELLING QUARTER SINCE INDUSTRY TRACKING BEGAN IN TWENTY TWELVE. HYDROGEN IS A VERSATILE FUEL CHOICE FOR TRANSPORTATION WITH MANY POSSIBLE PRODUCTION PATHWAYS FROM MULTIPLE FEEDSTOCKS AND PROVIDING ZERO TAILPIPE EMISSIONS WHEN PAIRED WITH THE FUEL CELL. HOWEVER THE FULL LIFE CYCLE OF HYDROGEN FUEL PRODUCTION DISTRIBUTION AND DISPENSING IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS A FINAL AND USE. CALIFORNIA POLICIES AND PROGRAMS HAVE LONG RECOGNIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF RENEWABLE AND LOW CARBON PRODUCTION. AND DISTRIBUTION PATHWAYS IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE EMISSIONS BENEFIT OFFERED BY HYDROGEN FUEL. BOB GLOBAL HYDROGEN PRODUCTION IS PROBABLY GENERATED FROM FOSSIL FUEL FEEDSTOCKS TYPICALLY NATURAL GAS. TO HYDROGEN DISPENSING CALIFORNIA'S HYDROGEN FUELING NETWORK IS STARKLY DIFFERENT. AND STATE POLICY REQUIRES ANY HYDROGEN FUELING STATION RECEIVING STATE FUNDS MUST DISPENSE AT LEAST THIRTY THREE POINT 3% OF ITS HYDROGEN FROM SORT. OF HIS THAT GENERATE THAT HYDROGEN USING RENEWABLE FEEDSTOCKS. IN TWENTY NINETEEN CHANGES TO LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD THE NEW CAPACITY BASED CREDIT ACCREDITING PROVISION FOR HYDROGEN FUEL STATIONS. INCLUDED A NEW AND HIGHER MINIMUM REQUIREMENT OF MAXIMUM CARBON INTENSITY. THE SAME RENEWABLE REQUIREMENT WAS INCORPORATED INTO THE ENERGY COMMISSION'S LATEST GRANT FUNDING SOLICITATION. ALL NEW HYDROGEN STATIONS RESULTING FROM THE STATE'S SUPPORT PROGRAMS WILL BE REQUIRED TO MEET THIS 40% RENEWABLE CONTENT MINIMUM ON AVERAGE. IN PRACTICE CALIFORNIA'S HYDROGEN FUELING NETWORK AT RECENTLY OPERATED WITH MUCH HIGHER RENEWABLE CONTENT. BASED ON DATA AVAILABLE THROUGH THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD CARD STAFF ESTIMATE THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY AND SO FAR IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE MOST OF CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA'S HYDROGEN FUELING NETWORK HAS DISPENSED HYDROGEN ATTY SUSTAINED 90% RENEWABLE CONTENT. STATION OPERATORS HAVE SHARED THAT THIS HIGH USE OF RENEWABLES IS NOT YET BASED ON LONG TERM CONTRACTS SO THE CONTINUATION OF SUCH HIGH RENEWABLE IMPLEMENTATION INTO THE FUTURE IS CURRENTLY UNCERTAIN. HOWEVER THIS IS A POSITIVE INDICATION THAT WOULD NORMALLY BASED HYDROGEN FUEL CAN BE A VIABLE COMPONENT OF THE STATE'S ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE STRATEGY. DR ALMOST HYDROGEN FUEL INCLUDING REAL HEARTY BELIEVES THAT ONE MINUTE. CLOSE ONE MINUTE TO CLOSE PLEASE. OKAY THANK YOU. SOME STATIONS DO HAVE ONSITE PRODUCTION IMAGES ON THE RIGHT ARE FROM THE COLOCATED LIGHT DUTY AND BUS HYDROGEN FUELING STATION AC TRANSIT AND EMERYVILLE. THE CANOPY IN THE IMAGE INTEGRATE SORT OF SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS WHICH PROVIDES ENERGY. RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY FOR HYDROGEN FUELING ONSITE. MUCH OF THE FOCUS IN CALIFORNIA SUPPORT PROGRAMS FOR HYDROGEN STATION DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN BUILT AROUND ACHIEVING CERTAIN TARGETS FOR COUNTS OF HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS. THIS IS IMPORTANT AND EARLY MARKET DEVELOPMENT AS DURING THE NETWORK TO A CERTAIN SIZE SUPPORTS INITIAL CUSTOMER ADOPTION OF FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES. HOWEVER THE NETWORK MATURES ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS ESPECIALLY ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE PLAY MORE VITAL ROLE IN ADDITION TO NUMBERS OF STATIONS AB EIGHT ALSO REFERENCES THE CONCEPT THE FINANCIAL SELF SUFFICIENCY. THAT IS THE ABILITY OF THE HYDROGEN FUELING NETWORK TO OPERATE AND CONTINUE TO GROW AS NEEDED WITHOUT ADDITIONAL STATE SUPPORT. OUR STAFF HAVE RECENTLY PUBLISHED A DRAFT REPORT BASED ON AN ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF SEVERAL SCENARIOS FOR FUTURE HYDROGEN FUELING STATION NETWORK DEVELOPMENT. THE DRAFT REPORT EVALUATES POTENTIAL FUTURE SCENARIOS OF STATION NETWORK GROWTH VEHICLE DEPLOYMENT AND DEVELOPMENTS AND STATION ECONOMICS TO ASSESS THE CONDITIONS THAT LEAD TO THE EMERGENCE OF A SELF SUFFICIENT HYDROGEN FUELING NETWORK. WE ARE WORKING WITH EASY TO CORPORATE SOME OF THESE FINDINGS INTO THE AB EIGHT REPORT. FINALLY EVEN WITH THE PROGRESS MADE TO DATE IN CALIFORNIA CHALLENGES REMAIN TO DEVELOPING A SELF SUFFICIENT HYDROGEN FUELING NETWORK PRIMARILY FOR FACTORS OTHER THAN GROWING THE NUMBER OF HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS. THAT'S BECAUSE STATIONS ARE ONLY PART OF THE FUEL CELL VEHICLE ECOSYSTEM WE OFTEN GET CALLS CUSTOMERS. RELIABLE FUEL SUPPLY AND LOWER FUEL COSTS. IN ORDER FOR THE ECOSYSTEM TO BECOME SUSTAINABLE WE NEED. SUFFICIENT THROUGHPUT AND USAGE OF THE HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS SO THEY BECOME PROFITABLE. ON THIS FIGHT ALSO OUTLINES A FEW. OF THE CHALLENGES SPECIFICALLY THAT WE HAVE SEEN THROUGH OUR EVALUATION. THANK YOU MISTER MARTINEZ SIMPLY STAY WITH US SO WE CAN- HAVE SOME QUESTIONS. AND ANSWERS. AFTER ALL THE PANELISTS. AND NEXT ON OUR PANEL IS LESLIE MOORE DIRECTOR OF FACILITIES AND FLEETS AT THE AMERICAN RED CROSS. LESLIE MORE YOU'VE GOT TO FLOOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR AND TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR LETTING US HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THE EXPERIENCE OF THE AMERICAN RED CROSS HAS HAPPENED ZERO EMISSION HYDROGEN FUEL CELL VEHICLES- AS YOU SAID MY NAME IS LESLIE MAHER OF THE STATE FACILITIES DIRECTOR FOR THE AMERICAN RED CROSS LOS ANGELES REGION- THE RED CROSS IS SO PLEASED TO BE TESTING THIS TECHNOLOGY. I'M TO HELP REDUCE THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE GLOBALLY WE CONSIDER CLIMATE CHANGE TO BE A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS EVERY DAY WE SEE THE HEARTBREAK OF FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES TRYING TO COPE WITH MORE INTENSE STORMS HEAVIER RAINFALL HIGHER TEMPERATURES. STRONG HURRICANES AND ESPECIALLY HERE WILDFIRES. TO GIVE YOU SOME BACKGROUND LATE LAST YEAR THE RED CROSS LOS ANGELES KICKED OFF ITS FIRST EVER ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE PILOT PROGRAM AFTER RECEIVING A DONATION OF FIVE HYDROGEN FUEL CELL VEHICLES WE RECEIVED AS DONATION FROM A PARTNER NONPROFIT ENERGY INDEPENDENCE NOW WORKING WITH TOYOTA. THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY TO ENTERPRISE- AND THE VEHICLES HAVE BEEN NOW IN USE FOR ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS. WE'VE BEEN SUPPORTING DISASTERS AND BIOMEDICAL OPERATIONS. COMBINED WE HAVE COVERED ALMOST SEVEN THOUSAND MILES AND HAVE ALREADY REDUCED FLEET EMISSIONS BY APPROXIMATELY TWO TONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE. WE'RE SO PROUD OF THAT NUMBER IN ADDITION TO REDUCING THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE WE'RE JUST SO HAPPY TO HELP REDUCE HARMFUL AIR POLLUTION FROM THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. WHICH DIRECTLY IMPACTS PUBLIC HEALTH. THE REASONS WHY THE FUEL CELL VEHICLES ARE SUCH A GOOD FIT FOR RED CROSS- ARE AS FOLLOWS. ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES HELP SUPPORT OUR SUSTAINABILITY GOALS TO RELATIVE TO AIR QUALITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE. THESE VEHICLES SPECIFICALLY OFFER BASS REVEALING IT TAKES ABOUT FIVE MINUTES AS YOU KNOW RED CROSSERS NEVER KNOW WHEN THEY'LL BE ABLE TO HELP WHEN THEY HAVE TO RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES SO WE NEED ACCESS TO FLEET VEHICLES WITH MINIMAL FEELING ARE CHARGING DOWNTIME. SO IF YOU ALSO ATTRIBUTE GOALS OFFER A LONG RANGE. THE RESPOND AS EVER KNOW WHEN THEY'LL HAVE TO GO TO AN EMERGENCY AND WHETHER THERE WILL BE ACCESS TO FUELING OR CHARGING IN THE FIELD- AND IN ADDITION. THE FEEL SOLID CRITICAL HAVE INTENTIONAL TO OFFER STATIONARY BACKUP POWER FROM THE ACTUAL VEHICLE. ZERO EMISSION BACKUP POWER ALLOWS THEM TO SUPPORT VITAL ACTIVITIES IN THE FIELD WITHOUT NOISE OR THE EMISSIONS OF THE TRADITIONAL DIESEL GENERATOR. SINCE LAUNCHING THIS PROGRAM THE RED CROSS DRIVERS HAVE GIVEN US VERY POSITIVE FEEDBACK ABOUT THE VEHICLES THEMSELVES. AND THE DRIVING EXPERIENCE. THE VEHICLES ARE IN EXCELLENT CONDITION AND THEY HANDLE REALLY WELL AND LA TRAFFIC. THE ABILITY TO DRIVE IN THE HOV LANE MAKES A CRITICAL DIFFERENCE OPERATIONS DURING DISASTERS MOBILE BLOOD DRIVES AND DELIVERIES OF THE BLOOD PRODUCTS. OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE I WILL SHARE HAS BEEN ACCESS TO FUELING STATIONS AND THE CONSISTENCY OF THE HYDROGEN FUEL SUPPLY. OUR REGION SERVICE MORE THAN ONE QUARTER OF THE POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA SPENDING LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE HAVE OFFICES FROM LONG BEACH TO PALMDALE. DOWNTOWN ATLANTA PRAMANA THE WHOLE COUNTY. WILL BE STRATEGICALLY PLACED THE VEHICLES AT OUR FACILITIES NEAR NEAREST TO THE FILLING STATIONS. SOMETIMES A STATIONS SOME OF THEM ONLY HAVE ONE TIME. IF THE SESSION GOES DOWN DUE TO A DISPENSER OR MECHANICAL ISSUE THERE'S NO ALTERNATE CONFUSE. IF THE VEHICLE HAPPENS TO BE LOW ON FUEL IT HAS TO SIT AT THE STATION UNTIL IT OPENS. BECAUSE THE NEAREST ONE COULD BE MILES AWAY. SO OUR FLEET TEAM INTERNALLY HAS PROTOCOLS TO CHECK THE FUEL STATUS OUT WHICH IS AN APP THAT YOU CAN DOWNLOAD ON YOUR PHONE. THAT GIVES YOU THE STATION STATUS PRIOR TO FUELING. AND TODAY WE ALSO HAVE A PROTOCOL TO IDENTIFY A BACKUP FUELING STATION JUST IN CASE THE FIRST ONE HAPPENED TO BE DOWN. OR OUT OF FUEL BY THE TIME WE ARRIVED. I CAN SHARE THAT PERSONALLY I'VE SEEN MANY HUNDREDS OF VEHICLES STRANDED AT FILLING STATIONS WAITING FOR THEM TOREPLENISH YOU'LL OR DISPENSER PROBLEM. THE RED CROSS FLEET TEAM HAS HAD TO USE GAS VEHICLES IN THE FLEET WHILE THE HYDROGEN ONE'S WAIT WAIT FEELING. WHICH IS NOT IDEAL FOR DISASTER RESPONSE- THE VEHICLES HAVE TO BE READY TO GO AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE. SO TO SUM UP. THE FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES BRINGING BENEFITS TO THE RED CROSS MISSION. TO SUSTAIN THESE VEHICLES AND THEIR BENEFITS IN THE LONG TERM WE WOULD URGE THE STATE TO EMBARK MORE FEELING STATIONS. AND HAVE MORE CONSISTENT FUEL REPLENISHMENT. IF THE HYDROGEN FUEL STATIONS WERE SET UP WITH IT AND MORE LOCATIONS AND WE'RE JUST A BIT MORE RELIABLE. WITH FEELING I WOULD NOT HESITATE TO RECOMMEND MORE FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES FOR THE RED CROSS FLEET. SO CLOSING I JUST WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU- THIS MORE- IF YOU'LL PLEASE STAND BY AND WE'LL GET TO. LATER WHEN WE GET ALL THE PANELISTS- COMPLETED WITH THEIR TESTIMONY NEXT WE HAVE THE BALL SIMON DIRECTOR OF ECO ECO COMPLIANCE AND RESEARCH AT HONDA MOTOR COMPANY. AT ANY TIME AND YOU'VE GOT TO FLOOR. THANK YOU SIR AND THANK YOU TO EVERYONE ON THE COMMITTEE FOR GIVING US TIME TODAY I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE EVERYONE CAN SEE MY SCREEN. YES THAT'S CORRECT GREAT SO AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE'RE HAPPY TO TALK TODAY ABOUT HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS AND SELL AND SHARE OUR EXPERIENCE IN THE- LAKE TO THE SEGMENT. I'M SO SORRY I WAS JUST A REALLY BRIEF INTRODUCTION A HYUNDAI- SOME YOU MAY KNOW WE ARE THE SIX LARGEST GLOBAL AUTOMOTIVE. ARE MANUFACTURED BY BRAND. MORE PROBLEMS SIMPLY OVER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE U. S. NATIONALLY WHEN YOU INCLUDE OUR DEALERS. WE PROUD THAT OUR HOME BASES RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. OUR NORTH AMERICAN HEADQUARTERS WHERE I'M TALKING FROM TODAY'S IN FOUNTAIN VALLEY. WE HAVE A DESIGN PRESENTS A IRVINE WE HAVE ENGINEERING IN CHINO AND WE HAVE OUR VEHICLE PROVING GROUNDS OF THE DUCKS DESERT IN CALIFORNIA CITY. SO WE'RE CONTRAST IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE'RE ACUTELY AWARE OF THE ISSUES THAT CALIFORNIA'S FACING AS WE TRANSITION OF ZERO QUESTIONS- WE'RE HAPPY TO REPORT WE HAVE HAD A RECORD YEAR FOR HYUNDAI DELIVERING OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND VEHICLES THROUGH THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR. AND WE THINK A LOT OF THAT SUCCESS IS DUE TO OUR GROWING ELECTRIFIED LINEUP WE HAVE TWELVE MODELS TODAY. AND THAT'S GOING TO GROW TO OVER TWENTY AND JUST A FEW YEARS. SO IF YOU LOOK AT OUR PRODUCTS OUR PAST PRESENT- WE REALLY DO BELIEVE- AND HISTORY OF DEVELOPING A RANGE OF ELECTRIFIED SOLUTIONS. TO MEET CUSTOMER NEEDS IN OTHER WORDS MORE THAN ONE TECHNOLOGY WITH HYBRIDS. BATTERY ELECTRICS AND OF COURSE FUEL CELLS AND AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE IMAGES. THESE ARE ACROSS ALL SEGMENTS NOT JUST LIGHT DUTY NOT JUST PASSENGER CARS. CARS SUVS TRUCKS BUSES HEAVY DUTY COMMERCIAL. SO REALLY WE BELIEVE IN CUSTOMER CHOICE AND A WIDE. VARIETY OF ELECTRIFIED SOLUTIONS AND WE THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT PATH TOWARDS ZERO EMISSIONS. BUT OF COURSE WE REALLY VALUE HYDROGEN AND FUEL CELL AND ITS POTENTIAL AND THE QUESTION IS WHY WHY ARE WE SO BULLISH ON HYDROGEN. WELL AS I MENTIONED TECHNOLOGICAL DIVERSITY IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR US SENATE SOME OF THE PRESENTERS OF START EARLIER- IT'S IMPORTANT NOT TO RELY ON ONE SINGLE TECHNOLOGY AS WE PURSUE A ZERO EMISSION PORTFOLIO. AND WE THINK FUEL CELLS CAN REALLY HELP DIVERSIFY OUR PORTFOLIO. CUSTOMER CHOICE OBVIOUSLY IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT TO US AND- THE BENEFIT OF- IN THE LIGHT DUTY SECTOR OF THE HYDROGEN IS THE SIMILAR FEELING. EXPERIENCE THAT PEOPLE ARE USED TO WITH GAS VEHICLES OF COURSE WITHOUT THE EMISSIONS AND YOU SEE THE IMAGE ON THE TOP OF. OF OUR NEXT SO. I DON'T- HUNDRED SHIELD STATION. AND THEN THE- THE PROMISE OF MULTIMODAL TRANSPORTATION APPLICATIONS FOR FUEL CELLS AND HYDROGEN. AND WE REALLY BELIEVE HYDROGEN IS A GREAT SOLUTION BEYOND PASSENGER CARS FOR HEAVY DUTY. CARGO AIR SHIPPING SO REALLY DEVELOPING THIS ECOSYSTEM. A LOT OF SYNERGIES CAN COME OUT OF IT AND REALLY BENEFIT HYDROGEN AND FUEL CELL ADVANCEMENT OVERALL. SO HERE HYDROGEN AT HYUNDAI WE- LAUNCH START EACH TO BRAND IT'S A PROPERLY NAMES REPRESENTS OUR COMMITMENT TO HYDROGEN AND FUEL CELLS AND REALLY IS. A REPRESENTATION OF OUR GOAL OF BROAD APPLICATION OF OUR FUEL CELL SYSTEM. OR ACTIVELY IMPROVING OUR SYSTEM ARE RIGHT NOW WORKING ON THE NEXT GENERATION WHICH HAVE ENHANCED PERFORMANCE AND DURABILITY. I DON'T GO LONG TERM BY TWENTY THIRTY IS PRODUCED SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THESE SYSTEMS. GLOBALLY AND SELL EVERY YEAR. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WE DO SEE BOAD APPLICATION BEYOND THE LIGHT DUTY SPACE- AND HEAVY DUTY COMMERCIAL AIR OF THE IMAGE ON THE SLIDE IN THE MIDDLE IS OUR HEAVY DUTY ACCION'S FUEL CELL. TRUCK WHICH IS- ACTIVELY DOING COMMERCIAL USED IN EUROPE AND WE- LITERALLY JUST ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY WE'RE GONNA BE DOING PROJECTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA STARTING NEXT MONTH. WITH THIS TRUCK SO WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. BUT I KNOW WE ARE FOCUSED ON LIGHT DUTY PASSENGER CARS AND HERE IN CALIFORNIA AS WAS MENTIONED IN OTHER PRESENTATIONS WE ARE SELLING. THE NEXT SO WHICH IS THE WORLD'S FIRST DEDICATED HYDROGEN POWERED SUV. IT'S BEEN ON SALE SINCE TWENTY EIGHTEEN- IT'S GOT RANGE OF UP TO THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILES SO REALLY INCREDIBLE RANGE AND- AS I MENTIONED JUST FIVE MINUTES THREE FEEL SO VERY NORMAL FEELING EXPERIENCE THAT PEOPLE ARE USED TO. AND- IF YOU'RE DRIVING NEXT TO YOUR REALIZE IT DRIVES JUST LIKE ANY OTHER VEHICLE ON THE ROAD- EXCEPT NO EMISSIONS IT HAS ADVANCED SAFETY AND TECHNOLOGY AND IT REALLY IS- SOMETHING WE'RE PROUD OF IS THE FIRST US UP. SO WE REALLY THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND AS WE LOOK TO EXPAND- HYDROGEN AND LIKE TO THE FUEL CELLS. WHAT ARE THE PRIORITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS OF THE OR THE CUSTOMERS CONSIDERING THIS TECHNOLOGY. A LOT OF WAYS- WHAT CUSTOMERS CONSIDER IS AS YOU WOULD EXPECT SOME OF THE OTHER ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE CUSTOMERS LIKE BETH CUSTOMERS. THEY CARE ABOUT EFFICIENCY. RANGE AND OF COURSE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS AND YOU SEE SOME OF THAT- HIGHLIGHTED IN BLUE ON THE LEFT. WHERE THE FUEL CELL SHOPPERS ARE UNIQUE IS A FOCUS ON CONVENTIONAL FEELING AS I MENTIONED AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND THIS IS REALLY SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE NEED TO BUILD OUT BECAUSE AGAIN THEY LIKE THE FACT THAT. THESE VEHICLES FUEL THE SAME WAY THAT THEY'RE USED TO BUT THEY NEED TO MAKE SURE THERE'S ENOUGH FUELING STATIONS AVAILABLE- AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE SEE IS AS CRITICAL TO CONSIDERATION AND CAN BE A TOP BARRIER. IF WE DON'T BUILD OUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE. WE TALK TO OUR NEXT SO OWNERS OBVIOUSLY- WE TRY TO GET AS MUCH FEEDBACK AS POSSIBLE WE'RE HAPPY TO REPORT. NEXT OWNERS DO LOVE THEIR CAR- FOR SOME OF THE TRADITIONAL REASONS PEOPLE MAY LOVE THEIR CARS THE DESIGN THE DRIVING EXPERIENCE. I MENTIONED THE RANGE IS IMPORTANT TO US HAVE CUSTOMERS OF UP TO THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILES. BUT THEY REALLY LOVE IT BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS A PARENT EARLY ADOPTER THEY HAVE SOMETHING SPECIAL IS UNIQUE THEY REALLY EMBRACE THIS TECHNOLOGY- AND THEY NOT ONLY ARE THEY LIKELY TO PURCHASE ANOTHER NEXT SO BUT THERE ARE ALSO LIKELY TO. RECOMMEND THE NEXT. ON THE FLIP SIDE THOUGH WHAT THEY DON'T LOG IN WHAT WE'RE HEARING. A LOT FROM SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS MOST RECENTLY IS THAT ALL OF THE FUELING EXPERIENCE. AND THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION ON THE SLIDE BUT I THINK- SOME OF THE IMAGES REALLY CONVEY. THE POINT DAMAGE ON THE RIGHT. IS A LINE OF FUEL CELL VEHICLES TAKEN- I THINK MAYBE IN TWENTY NINETEEN. WAITING TO RE FUEL SO YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT YOU DON'T WANT CUSTOMERS. TO HAVE TO WAIT A LONG TIME. TO GET FUEL FOR THEIR CARS. SO REALLY- ON A HIGH LEVEL- SOME OF THE KEY POINTS OF IT EXPERIENCING. OFTEN RELIABILITY ISSUES AND DOWNTIME DAMAGE ON THE LOWER RIGHT IS TAKEN JUST LAST WEEK. WHEN THE FUEL CELL PARTNERSHIP'S WEBSITE AND YOU SEE THE RED- THE RED SQUARES AND THAT INDICATES SOME OF THE STATIONS ARE DOWN FOR WHATEVER REASON. SO THAT'S SOMETHING CUSTOMERS HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING- OBVIOUSLY WE TALK ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE LIMITED NUMBER STATION SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S CRITICAL TO EXPAND. AND EVEN ISSUES WITH THE PUMP THEMSELVES OF THE IF THE STATION IS WORKING AND THERE IS FUEL- YES SOME TECHNICAL ISSUES AND HOW TO FUEL THE PUMPS FREEZING. SO IT'S REALLY BROUGHT ABOUT SOME INTERESTING BUYER BEHAVIOR THE BUYERS REALLY NEED TO- FEEL SO DRIVERS REALLY NEED TO PLAN THE ROUTES CAREFULLY. AND EVEN GO TO- STATIONS WHEN THEY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUEL LEFT A HUNDRED MILES OR MORE. JUST IF THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FEEL UP THEY WILL JUST TO- HOPEFULLY THE VOID THE SITUATION OF. OF NOT HAVING FUEL THEY'LL- SO- IN SOME REAL CLOSE WITH SOLUTIONS FOR THE CONSIDERATION AND- HERE HYUNDAI WE DO REALIZE- TO ADVANCED FUEL CELL AND HYDROGEN WHICH WERE FIRMLY BEHIND AS THE TECHNOLOGY AS A COMPANY. WE REALIZE THIS NEEDS TO BE A COMBINED EFFORT BOTH FROM THE PRIVATE SIDE AND PUBLIC SIDE. AND ON OUR PART ON THE PRIVATE SIDE WE ARE ACTIVELY INVESTIGATING PARTNERSHIPS. TO DEVELOP THIS INFRASTRUCTURE WE THINK IT'S CRITICAL. I'M WE'RE WE'RE PURSUING PARTNERSHIPS WITH IN CALIFORNIA EVEN OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIANS WE HOPE- TO SPREAD- THE DOBSON OF FUEL CELL AND HYDROGEN EVEN OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA VENTRALLY. AND OBVIOUSLY OUR CUSTOMERS ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT SO WE WANT TO SUPPORT THEM IN THIS TRANSITIONAL TIME SO. ANYWAY THAT WE CAN ASSIST OUR CUSTOMERS WERE CHALLENGED. WITH THE CURRENT INFRASTRUCTURE UNTIL SUPPLY. WE FIND WAYS TO DO THAT. ON THE SIDE WE DO PROPOSE SOME SOLUTIONS FOR CONSIDERATION. I'M OBVIOUSLY LONG TERM DEDICATED FUNDING FOR HYDROGEN STATIONS WITH. THE GOAL OF AS MANY AS A THOUSAND STATIONS IN OPERATION BY TWENTY THIRTY AND WE KNOW THIS IS. AN AMBITIOUS GOAL REALLY THINK HAVING A HUGE- REALLY- ROBUST INFRASTRUCTURE WILL. EXPONENTIALLY INCREASE THE- THE FINAL FUEL CELLS ON THE ROAD. OBVIOUSLY ONE FUEL CELLS TO BE ELIGIBLE LONG TERM FOR- ANY STATE INCENTIVES THAT ARE OFFERED TO OTHER- ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. AND EVEN CONSIDERATION OF TAX INCENTIVES FOR- GASOLINE STATION OPERATORS TO CONVERT THEIR CURRENT STATIONS TWO HUNDRED. AND FINALLY I THINK THIS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER OF THE NOTION OF FUEL SUBSIDIES TO ACHIEVE PRICE PARITY HYDROGEN. IT IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN GASOLINE SO WE THINK IF THERE'S A LEVEL- PARITY WITH GASOLINE THIS WILL GET A LOT OF- CONSUMERS INTERESTED IN HYDROGEN WITH THE RIGHT STRUCTURE. SO AGAIN- SUBMIT SOLUTIONS FIRST CONSIDERATION- WE WOULD LOVE TO DISCUSS THIS FURTHER AND- I JUST WANT TO THANK- COMMITTEE INSIDER FOR TIME TODAY FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO OUT OF SERVICE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SO MUCH AND PLEASE STAND BY. FOR ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS- WHEN THE LAST SPEAKER. COMES ON THE AIR- AND NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM- LOW ROCHA- MR VICTOR ROCHE'S CEO AND PRESIDENT AND CO FOUNDER. TOTAL TRANSPORTATION SERVICES MR LOW ROSA YOU HAVE THE FLOOR WE HAD TEN MINUTES. THANK YOU SATURDAY NIGHT AND I THINK COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY TODAY. I THINK THE MOST THAT I CAN CONTRIBUTE IT IS BY TELLING THE T. T. SI STORY. I THINK. LET ME START OUT BY SAYING THAT ALTHOUGH A LOT OF CONSTRUCTION IS BEGINNING TO LIGHT DUTY WE ARE 1100% HEAVY DUTY USE. WE SERVICE SUPPORTS IN NOT ONLY CALIFORNIA BUT THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES WERE IN SEATTLE WHERE IN NEW JERSEY WHERE IT'S JUST OUT OF GEORGIA WERE CHICAGO. A WIN SEATTLE TACOMA. AND A COMMON SCHEME MOST COURTS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES IS THAT WERE BASED IN. GENERALLY THE INNER CITY GENERALLY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY IT'S- SO THEY NEED TO GET TO ZERO EMISSIONS IS A CENTRAL- PTS I STARTED ITS JOURNEY BACK THAT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN THE PORTS OF LONG BEACH AND LOS ANGELES. FIRST INTRODUCED THE CLEAN AIR ACTION PROGRAM WE STARTED TO DO A LOT OF INTERNAL INVESTIGATION INTO EXACTLY WHERE THIS WHERE THIS WOULD LEAD. AND WE DETERMINED THAT THE GULF COAST REGION TEN YOU TO MOVE UNTIL WE WERE ADIZERO MISSION. SO WE MADE A CORPORATE DECISION TO GO TO ZERO EMISSION WE'RE NOT ONLY GOING TO ZERO EMISSION IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE HE PLANNED TO DO THIS ON A NATIONAL BASIS. IN CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY WE ARE ALMOST 1100% OUT OF DIESEL. OUR JOURNEY THE LAST. ELEVEN OR TWELVE YEARS HAS BEEN MAJORLY. AS A CONVERSION INTO NATURAL GAS. WE HAVE HEAVILY EACH WE HAVE HEAVILY EXPERIMENTED WITH. BATTERY ELECTRIC WITH FUEL AND WITH FUEL CELL AS WELL. WE HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT ALL THE DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES BECAUSE- IT'S BEEN A VERY VERY BY BEING VERY VERY RANGY GRINDING ROAD ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE USE AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES- WON'T. OUR EXPERIENCE WITH NATURAL GAS IS THAT IT TOOK US TEN YEARS AND FIVE ITERATIONS OF AN ENGINE TO GET TO AN ENGINE THAT WE ARE VERY VERY COMFORTABLE WITH WHICH IS GIVING US LOW KNOCKS- AND LOW CARBON. FOOTPRINT AND THE ENGINE WORKS BY. VERY VERY WELL IT'S COMPLETELY REBUILT REPLACED ALL OF THE DEMANDS THAT WE PUT ON A T. SHIRT DIESEL VEHICLES WE ARE HOPING TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS WITH BATTERY ELECTRIC AND HOPEFULLY HYDROGEN FUEL CELL. I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT DR BROUWER'S PRESENTATION GAVE ME A GREAT DEAL OF HOPE BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW TRYING TO DECIDE WHAT WOULD BE THE TECH BEST TECHNOLOGY FOR US LONG TERM WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT- D. THE GREAT REQUIREMENTS AND THE DO YOU STRESS THAT WILL FIT ON THE GRID FOR ST BATTERY ELECTRIC CLASS EIGHT VEHICLES WILL BE SUSTAINABLE WE THINK THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE A VERY VERY DIFFICULT GOAL TO REACH. WE HAVE EXPERIMENTED WITH HYDROGEN AND THE ISSUES THAT WE THAT WE HAVE. I HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH HYDROGEN ARE NUMBER ONE. NATURALLY THE ISSUE THE COST OF THE VEHICLES THE VEHICLES ARE THE KEY DEMONSTRATION REELS THAT WE USE ARE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE. AND EXTREMELY- WE'VE HAS A LOT OF ISSUES WITH- WITH THE TECHNOLOGY ITSELF. I MANY TIMES THE- THE CHILL CELLS ARE UNDER POWERED THE TECHNOLOGY TRUCK IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE- IT'S A VERY VERY TECHNICAL INSTRUMENT UNLIKE THE AUTOMOBILES. WHICH TEND TO BE MORE RELIABLE. FROM EIGHT AM AT AS WE UNDERTAKE ANY OF THESE DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES WE ALWAYS LOOK TO. BE SEX SELF SUSTAINABLE FROM A FUEL SOURCE SO EVEN WITH NATURAL GAS WE LOOKED AT EITHER A LEASING STATIONS OURSELVES OR BUILDING STATIONS. IN OUR FACILITIES TO SERVICE OUR FLEET AS WE LOOK TO HYDROGEN AS WE LOOKED INTO A TO BATTERY ELECTRIC WE'RE ALSO LOOKING FOR THOSE KIND OF SOLUTIONS BECAUSE WE CANNOT BE AT THE MERCY OF THE NETWORK NOT BEING ABLE TO MEET OUR DEMANDS BECAUSE WE WILL FAIL. TO SERVICE OUR CUSTOMERS SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THESE PROJECTS WE LOOK AT IT FROM THE ASPECT OF TOTALITY WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO. SURVIVE FROM FROM CRADLE TO GRAVE WITH THE WITH THE FUEL AND THE AND THE TECHNOLOGY ITSELF. WE HAVE MADE A GREAT DEAL WE'VE MADE GREAT STRIDES IN MOVING FORWARD ON THE- BATTERY ELECTRIC FRONT. AGAIN WE'RE VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE- THE- THE GREAT ITSELF IN THE POWER SOURCE. NOW WE'RE WE'RE STARTING TO TAKE DELIVERIES OF WE JUST TOOK DELIVERY OF THE TOYOTA FUEL CELL WE HAVE ANOTHER TOYOTA FUEL CELL COMING WE'RE GONNA BE TAKING DELIVERY OF SOME ADDITIONAL FUEL CELLS FROM TRANSPOWER. AND WE'VE SIGNED AN AGREEMENT WITH NICHOLAW FOR SIXTY FUEL CELL VEHICLES AND FORTY BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES- AS I MENTIONED BEFORE OUR PLAN IS TO. SLOWLY NOW TRANSITION OUT OF NATURAL GAS IN CALIFORNIA AND TRANSITION INTO A FULL. ZERO EMISSIONS FLEET- AND AS YOU'VE HEARD THERE ARE THERE'S THE D. JUST FROM THE LIGHT DUTY SIDE THE REQUIREMENTS FROM THE- USERS ARE REALLY ALL BOIL DOWN TO INFRASTRUCTURE. SO I WOULD I COMMEND THE WORK THAT CARBON AND G. H. U. N. G. ARE DOING AND HELPING DEVELOP AN EXTRA TRIP BUT I THINK AND I BELIEVE WE NEED A LOT MORE WORK DONE IN THIS AREA. AND AGAIN I HAVE TO STRESS THE COST THE COST OF THESE VEHICLES AND THE COST OF THE FUEL ITSELF. AFTER COME DOWN DRAMATICALLY FOR IN ORDER FOR US TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE IN THE MARKETPLACE. BEING YOU KNOW KIND OF A AN AN AN INITIAL USER WE ARE TO TREMENDOUS COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE- ACT WHEN WE GO UP AGAINST THE MARKET THAT IS EITHER. I'M WILLING TO MAKE THE SWITCH OR IS LYING BACK IN THE TRUCK AND WAITING FOR SOMEONE ELSE TO. YOU KNOW TAKE ALL THE ARROWS IN THE BACK. AND WE JUST WE JUST WANTED STATE COMMITTED AND WE JUST WANT TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD TO GET TO. ZERO MEASURE AND THE INFORMATION THAT I- ASCERTAIN TODAY IS GOING TO BE VERY VERY HELPFUL IN HELPING US DEVELOP OUR FUTURE PLANS SO AGAIN I THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY. AND I FIND THE- THE PARTICIPANTS ON THE PANEL FOR SHARING INFORMATION WITH US TONIGHT. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY- I REALLY APPRECIATED. AND OUR LAST PRESENTER IS REBECCA KAPLAN VICE MAYOR OF THE CITY OF OAKLAND- MATTER VICE MAYOR YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR GOOD AFTERNOON AND I INCREDIBLY APPRECIATE THE INVITATION TO BE A PART OF THIS IMPORTANT PANEL AS WE TALK ABOUT THIS VITAL STRATEGY THE USE OF HYDROGEN FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY TO MEET OUR NEEDS FOR TRANSPORTATION FOR ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY AND TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC HEALTH. I AM THE VICE MAYOR OF OAKLAND COUNCILMEMBER AT LARGE SAY REPRESENT THE ENTIRE CITY AND PRIOR TO THAT I SERVED ON THE BOARD OF AC TRANSIT OUR LOCAL BUS OPERATOR WHICH TWO DECADES AGO BECAME ONE OF THE FIRST TO ADOPT THE USE OF HYDROGEN FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY. AND SO I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS EFFORT FOR SOME TIME AND I THINK IT IS INCREDIBLY PROMISING AND VITAL THAT WE TAKE THE STEPS NOW TO EXPAND THE USE OF HYDROGEN FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY. WE HAVE BEEN USING IT THROUGH AC TRANSIT FOR BUSES OVER TWO DECADES AND THE HYDROGEN FUEL CELL BUSES ARE HAVING EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE EXCELLENT RELIABILITY AND ZERO EMISSIONS AND SO IN RECENT MONTHS I'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER WITH MANY DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THE ALAMEDA COUNTY TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION THE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT THE PORT OF OAKLAND. EAST BAY MUD AND WITH THE SUPPORT OF CARB AND THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION WE ARE LAUNCHING ZERO EMISSION HYDROGEN FUEL CELL TRUCK PROGRAM AT THE PORT OF OAKLAND. WHICH IS SOME OTHERS ON THIS PANEL ARE ALSO FAMILIAR WITH BUT THE ABILITY TO LAUNCH HYDROGEN FUEL CELL TRUCKS IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR MULTIPLE REASONS INCLUDING TO REDUCE THE POLLUTION IMPACTS ON OUR COMMUNITY AND I'M GOING TO SHARE A SLIDE TO HIGHLIGHT THIS POINT. THE D. AIR POLLUTION THIS IS A MAP THAT WAS PRODUCED BY THE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT SHOWING THE AIR POLLUTION CANCER RISK TWO THOUSAND FIVE AND THEN TEN YEARS LATER AND THIS PURPLE LINE SHOWING WITH THE HIGHEST DE. OF POLLUTION IS IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE EAST BAY REGION THIS TRACKS THE EIGHT EIGHTY HIGHWAY THROUGH EAST OAKLAND STARTING IN SAN LEANDRO UP THROUGH EAST OAKLAND. AND THEN HERE INTO WEST OAKLAND AROUND THE PORT AND SO THIS IS WHERE WE SEE THE CONTINUED DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF AIR POLLUTION. AND ASTHMA CANCER AND ALL OF THE NEGATIVE HEALTH IMPACTS BECOME WITHOUT POLLUTION. AND THIS IS PREDOMINATELY OVER AN AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND PREDOMINANTLY OVER LOWER INCOME COMMUNITY THAT HAS BEEN SUBJECTED FOR DECADES. TO THIS DISPROPORTIONATE AIR POLLUTION AND THAT IS COMING LARGELY FROM DIESEL PARTICULATE EMISSIONS FROM TRUCKS. AND SO THIS IS A TRUCK CORRIDOR IT SERVES NOT ONLY THE PORT OF OAKLAND BUT ALSO TO VARIOUS WAREHOUSES AND OTHER FACILITIES. AND THE DIESEL EMISSIONS FROM THE TRUCKS ARE THE MAJOR SOURCE OF HELP FORMING POLLUTION IN THIS AREA. AND SO FIGURING OUT HOW TO DO ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS. IS REALLY ESSENTIAL BOTH TO THE GLOBAL CLIMATE AND TO THE HUMAN HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MOST DESPERATELY IMPACTED. AND SO WE HAVE PURSUED ALL OF THE DIFFERENT AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGIES WE DO HAVE SOME BATTERY ELECTRIC TRUCKS AS WELL AS BATTERY AND HYBRID ELECTRIC CRANES GOING IN AT THE PORT OF OAKLAND- AND SOME THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN INSTALLED. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO A LONG HOLD VEHICLES THE BATTERIES ARE NOT SUFFICIENT AND SO IT IS VITAL THAT WE ALSO INCLUDE AND EXPAND THE USE. OF HYDROGEN FUEL CELL WHICH HAS THE DURABILITY AS WELL AS THE ABILITY TO SERVE THOSE LONGER DISTANCES. IN BETWEEN FUELING AND SO WE ARE SUPER GRATEFUL FOR THE NEW STATE FUNDING THAT WAS ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY IT WILL ALLOW US TO LAUNCH A MAJOR FUELING STATION- IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE PORT OF OAKLAND AND A BATCH OF TRUCKS. AND OF COURSE HAVING THIS FEELING STATION WILL ALLOW US TO ATTRACT OTHER TRUCKS EVEN BEYOND THE ONES THAT ARE PART OF THE GRANT FUNDED PROJECT. I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT. THE ABILITY TO DRIVE THEM ON THE STREETS WITH THAT NEEDED WICKS ARE ALSO PART OF THE PATH THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT. END IN ADDITION WE ARE PURSUING LONGER TERM THE ABILITY TO HAVE LOCALLY PRODUCED SUSTAINABLY PRODUCED HYDROGEN IN PARTNERSHIP WITH EAST BAY MUD WHICH IS OUR WASTE WATER HANDLING- UTILITY. AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS CERTAINLY TO BE LOOKING TO FIND ARE THE SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION OF HYDROGEN THAT THAT IS ONE OF THE ADDITIONAL OPTIONS THE WE ARE PURSUING AND THAT SHOULD BE PART OF OUR FUTURE. I WOULD ALSO NOTE STATE LAST SUMMER WHEN WE HAD SOME OF THE WORST AIR QUALITY DAYS OF ALL TIME WHEN IT WAS INCREDIBLY HOT AND WE WERE COVERED WITH SMOKE FROM WILDFIRES. IT LARGE FACILITIES LIKE THE PORT OF OAKLAND WERE DIRECTED TO CUT BACK ON THEIR ELECTRICITY USE WERE DIRECTED TO STOP ELECTRICITY USE AND SO A PATH TOWARDS ZERO EMISSIONS THAT RELIES PURELY ON ELECTRICITY WAS THEN SHUT DOWN ON THE WORST POLLUTION DAYS. AND THEY WERE TOLD TO THEN TURN ON DIESEL. BECAUSE OF THE INABILITY TO USE THE ELECTRICAL GRID HYDROGEN FUEL CELL CAN SOLVE THAT PROBLEM WE CAN HAVE SOMETHING THAT IS ZERO EMISSIONS THAT DOES NOT POLLUTE. AND WHICH ALSO IS AVAILABLE TO BE USED EVEN ON DAYS WHEN THE ELECTRIC GRID MAY BE STRAINED AND IN FACT THE USE OF HYDROGEN CAN REDUCE THAT STRAIN ON THE ELECTRICITY GRID. SO THIS IS VITALLY IMPORTANT FOR OUR REGION AS WELL AS FOR OUR GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY. ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS I THINK IT'S USEFUL TOTHINK ABOUT IN THIS CONTEXT IS THAT FREIGHT IS OFTEN LEFT OUT OF THE CONTEXT OF REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND OTHER EFFORTS AND YET FREE IS. A FAR MORE SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF POLLUTION IN TRANSPORTATION SO FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS EIGHT CASH FOR CLUNKERS PROGRAM FOR CARS WHERE YOU CAN TURN IN A POLLUTING OLD CAR FOR MONEY AND IT GETS TAKEN OFF ROAD. WE ALSO NEED A CASH FOR CLUNKERS PROGRAM FOR TRUCKS WE HAVE BAD POLITICAL TRUST THAT COULD BE BOUGHT AND TAKEN OFF THE ROAD. AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT STRATEGIES TO REDUCE EMISSIONS AND REDUCE POLLUTION WE NEED TO INCORPORATE FREE AS WELL AS PASSENGER VEHICLES. AS WE LOOK AT THESE STRATEGIES. ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES OF LOOKING AT CENTRALLY LOCATED FUELED LEADS IS THAT WE CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE USE OF HYDROGEN EVEN AS WE CONTINUE TO BUILD OUT MORE STATIONS. SO WHEN YOU HAVE A FACILITY LIKE A PORT. IT IS SERVED BY MANY VEHICLES HAVING HYDROGEN FUELING IN THOSE LOCATIONS CAN GREATLY ENABLED THE UPTAKE BY MANY MORE USERS WHO USE THOSE FACILITIES. IN ADDITION THE NEW FUELING STATION AT THE PORT OF OAKLAND WILL ALLOW HYDROGEN TRUCKS TO SERVE THE ENTIRE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CORRIDOR WITH FUELING AVAILABLE ON BOTH ENDS. AS WELL AS SERVING AREAS BEYOND HERE URTHER NORTH AND FURTHER EAST. SO IT IS AS SOME OF THE OTHER SPEAKERS HAVE POINTED OUT VITALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE THOSE FUELING STATIONS AND TO HAVE THEM IN THE LOCATIONS WHERE THEY ARE NEEDED. TO MAXIMIZE THESE USES IN WAYS THAT REDUCE THE POLLUTION REDUCE THE IMPACTS ON OUR COMMUNITY AND EVEN ALLOW US TO PRODUCE OUR OWN FUEL FROM WASTE SO WE ENCOURAGE THAT THAT BE PART OF WHAT IS EXPANDED. IN THE RESEARCH AND FUNDING GOING FORWARD AS WELL AS PROGRAMS LIKE THOSE BEING LAUNCHED NOW FOR THE TRUCKS AND THE FUELING STATIONS. AS WE SEE MORE AND MORE ADOPTION OF THESE HEAVY DUTY USES THOSE FILLING STATIONS ALSO CAN ENABLE THE LIGHT DUTY USERS AS WELL SO WE CAN SERVE BOTH AS NEEDED IN SOME FACILITIES. BUT I THINK IT'S VITAL THAT WE NOT LEAVE OUT THE HEAVY DUTY USES AS THOSE CAN HAVE A VERY DRAMATIC IMPACT. ON REDUCING THE POLLUTION IMPACTS ON OUR COMMUNITIES AND HAVING SEEN OVER TWENTY YEARS THE SUCCESS OF THE AC TRANSIT HYDROGEN FUEL CELL BUSES WHICH ARE A SIMILAR SIZE TO WHAT WE SEE FOR TRUCKS. WE KNOW THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY CAN WORK WELL FOR THE HEAVY DUTY USES AND SO I WANTED TO SHARE THAT GOOD NEWS AND THAT. THOUGHT AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND I'M SO GRATEFUL FOR THE EXIT SINCE OF THIS COME. AND HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU AS WE WORK TO IMPROVE OUR ENVIRONMENT AND THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITIES. AND BUILD A MORE SUSTAINABLE FUTURE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE TIME AND ATTENTION. THANK YOU MADAM VICE MAYOR- SO STAND BY WE'RE GOING pGOING TO ASK SOME OF THE SENATORS WHO ARE HOPEFULLY ARE STILL WITH US SENATOR BEN ALLEN CENTER AND A CABRILLO. SENATOR BEN WESO CENTER BRIAN JONES CENTER JOSH NEWMAN AND CENTER NANCY SKINNER SO SENATORS- THE FLOORS OPEN IF YOU'D LIKE TO- JUMP IN WITH QUESTIONS YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM OUR SENATORS. ANYONE ON THE LINE. IF NOT I'M GOING TO START OFF WITH A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS PHILLIPS- ARE VERY FIRST PANELISTS IF YOU RECALL THE DOCTOR- JACK BAUER HERE'S MY QUESTION TO YOU THAT- TO GET THIS COSTS DOWN OF HYDROGEN- AND TO REDUCE THE COST OF THE CARS NOW IN PRODUCTION. WHAT WOULD YOUR RECOMMENDATION. WELL FIRST OF ALL WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THE- PLACE THAT THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE ON THE COST CURVE IS VERY STEEP. IT HAS NOT ENGENDERED AS MUCH INVESTMENT AS THINGS LIKE SOLAR BATTERIES AND THOSE TECHNOLOGY IS WILL HAVE A SIMILAR COST REDUCTION KERR BY I PREDICT TWO COMPARED TO BATTERIES AND SOLAR AND SO INVESTMENT IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO ENABLE THE EXPERIENCE. OF THE DRIVERS OKAY ESPECIALLY WITH REGARD TO FUELING I THINK IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT I THINK THIS IS THE MOST CRITICAL ITEM THAT WE HAD THAT WE FACE TODAY. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A GOOD AN ADEQUATE HYDROGEN SUPPLY ADEQUATE HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS AN AT THE CEILING STATIONS CONTINUE TO BE AN OPERATION AND OPERATE WELL- THERE ALSO COULD BE- THE CONSIDERATION OF. YOU KNOW HOW L. CFS CREDITS ARE APPLIED IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE AND I THINK THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR. FOR THIS FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE INCLUDED IN THE LCS US CREDIT SYSTEM I THINK IT SHOULD CONTINUE. AND THE WINNER WHEN A COUPLE OF ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS- WHY IS A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GAS COMPANY SO EXCITED ABOUT HYDROGEN IN THEIR LINES IN THERE WITH PARTNERSHIP WITH THE HYDROGEN INDUSTRY. BUT LET ME SUGGEST I THINK IT OFFERS THEM ONE OF THE MOST PROMISING VECTORS FOR RETAINING A REASONABLE BUSINESS IN A ZERO EMISSIONS WORLD- FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THE WELL IT'S OBVIOUS IT'S A LAW THAT WE WILL NOT BE USING FOSSIL FUELS IN TWENTY FORTY FIVE. AND IF THAT'S THE CASE THERE NEEDS TO BE AN ALTERNATIVE THAT CAN THAT CAN BE USED THAT CAN USE THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE. AND I SUGGEST ALSO THAT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE IS VERY VALUABLE. THAT INFRASTRUCTURE SUPER VALUABLE TO OUR ZERO EMISSIONS GOALS BUT WE MUST TRANSFORM IT. CAN'T JUST STATE- TRANSMITTING FOSSEL- GAS NOT MAYBE A SMALL AMOUNT OF FOSSIL GAS COULD BE USED IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES WITH CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE BUT I THINK THAT BY FAR AND AWAY. THE MOST IMPORTANT TRANSFORMATION WILL BE TO RENEWABLE HYDROGEN. SO YOU THINK THAT- INSERTING AT LEAST GAS PIPELINE WOULD BE SAFE IT WOULD BE PRUDENT. AND IT WOULD BE THE WAY OF THE FUTURE AND ALSO- IT WOULD BE SAFE AT WITH THAT NATURAL GAS FOR THE PIPELINE TO THE USAGE IS THAT CORRECT. BUT WE SUGGEST THAT THERE ARE A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT AND DEMONSTRATION- PROJECTS THAT SHOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED BEFORE WE WOULD. INJECT IT EVERYWHERE- BUT MOST OF THE STUDIES BOTH HERE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS HAVE FOUND THAT MIXTURES UP TO A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TEN AND FIVE AND 20% OR SO. ARE LIKELY TO BE VERY SAFE UNDER MOST CIRCUMSTANCES NOW AGAIN. THERE NEEDS TO BE INVESTMENT TO MAKE SURE IT'S SAFE WHEREVER WE'RE GOING TO DO IT BUGS VERY IMPORTANTLY. V. TRANSFORMATION OR THE INTRODUCTION OF 5% IT IS NOT SO IMPORTANT WITH REGARD TO DECARBONISING GAS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T GIVE US A BIG DECARBONISATION IMPACT ON THE GAS SYSTEM. IT'S MOST IMPORTANT FOR ENGENDERING. EIGHT RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY OFFTAKE IT'S FOR ENABLING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO CONTINUE TO MASSIVELY INVEST IN SOLAR AND WIND ELECTRICITY BECAUSE THAT WILL BE THE BOSS TAKE WHEN WE DON'T WANT IT RIGHT NOW LIKE WHAT'S CURRENTLY HAPPENING WE'RE CURTAILING MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY TODAY SO WHENEVER THERE IS A CHEAPOR OTHERWISE CURTAILED ELECTRICITY WE CAN USE THE HYDROGEN VECTOR AND INJECTION UP 25% IN THE GAS SYSTEM WILL. ENABLE A LOT OF ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN SOLAR AND WIND AND LET ME LET ME JUST MENTION THOUGH 5% IT INJECTION IN THE GAS SYSTEM WILL BE INVESTIGATED AND INVESTED IN AND THEN YOU CAN ALSO DETERMINE HOW YOU CAN TRANSFORM FROM THE INITIAL PARTIAL DETERMINATION DECARBONISATION OF THE GAS SYSTEM DOES START TO FIGURE OUT- THIS IS WHERE WE REALLY HAVE A LEAKAGE PROBLEM- THIS IS WHERE IT REALLY WHERE WE HAVEN'T- MATERIAL DEGRADATION PROBLEMS AND YOU'LL START TO SAY OKAY I'M GONNA TAKE THIS PIPE OUT AND I'M GONNA PUT IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT. I'M TO TAKE THIS VALVE OUT AMID PUT IN A DIFFERENT DOLLARS WE'RE GOING TO COPE THIS OVER HE AND THEN IT CAN A 100% TYPE REGION IN THE FUTURE. WHAT WE HAVE TO START INVESTING IN AT AND THE BEGINNING OF THE INVESTMENT. INVESTING IN AND- HI JR NOVICE IS THE WAY TO GO- SO OF GOT A DISH QUESTIONS- LET'S SEE- ANDREW MARTINEZ- I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU- HE HAD MENTIONED ABOUT THE NUMBER OF STATIONS THAT ARE. THAT WOULD BE NEEDED IN THE FUTURE- SO WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT THE TWO HUNDRED STATIONS ARE PUT IN- ARE WE GOING TO CONTINUE. LOOKING IN THAT DIRECTION WITH THE EXPANSION OF THE AUTOMOBILES AND- THE POPULARITY OF THE FUEL CELL CARS WHAT HAPPENS WITH THAT NUMBER. WE LOOK INTO AN INCREASE. YES SO- OUR DRAFT SELF SUFFICIENCY REPORT LOOKS AT THIS QUESTION- IN TERMS OF HYPOTHETICAL POTENTIAL FUTURE SCENARIOS. AND WE HAVE LOOKED AT POTENTIAL SCENARIOS THAT ARE BILLED. I JUST A FEW MORE STATIONS OUT TO ABOUT THREE HUNDRED STATIONS OR SCENARIOS THAT BUILD. UP TO- ABOUT ONE THOUSAND STATIONS AND IN TWENTY THIRTY AND MORE BEYOND- OUR DRAFT REPORT. DISCUSSES THE POSSIBILITIES OF THESE DIFFERENT SCENARIOS- BUT IN TERMS OF ACTUAL THE ACTUAL- DECISION MAKING THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I PERSONALLY CANNOT SPEAK TO- AND I THINK THAT WE CAN ALL FIND THAT WE'RE ALL LOOKING FOR CLEAN ENVIRONMENT AND OBVIOUSLY- I MENTIONED THE TREASURE CHEST OF ENERGY. AND I'M SO GLAD THAT YOU ARE PARTICIPATING TODAY BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE BY THE PANELISTS THAN WHAT YOU'VE HEARD THAT INCLUDING HYDROGEN IN THAT TREASURE CHEST OF ENERGY IS SO IMPORTANT. SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU IN THE FUTURE ON THIS SO LET'S GO OVER SOME OF THE OTHERS- AMERICAN RED CROSS. LESLIE MORE WE WERE CHAU OF PROUD OF WHAT YOU DO THE AMERICAN RED CROSS YOU HAD MENTIONED HOW. SOME OF YOUR VEHICLES ARE. ARE RUNNING ON HYDROGEN LIKE TO THANK YOU ABOUT THAT SO I'D LIKE TO JUST HAVE YOU COME BACK IN. AND CAN YOU GIVE US AN EXAMPLE HOW. IT WAS A SURPRISE TO YOU THE ECONOMY OR THE DISTANCE WHAT SURPRISED YOU ABOUT. THE FUEL CELL HYDROGEN AUTOMOBILE. OF THE AUTOMOBILE ITSELF- IT IS ACTUALLY THERE WERE NO SURPRISES IT RUNS EXACTLY THE WAY GAS VEHICLE RUNS TO ME- I DRIVE THEM EVERY WEK I THINK THE SURPRISE WAS REALLY JUST IN THE FUELING AND US SOME OF THAT THE CHALLENGES IN THE ACTUAL KILLING STATIONS IT JUST IT JUST TAKES LIKE ONE LITTLE THING A MECHANICAL ISSUE OR SOMETHING TO KIND OF- TO SHUT THE WHOLE STATION DOWN SO THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A SURPRISE BUT THE VEHICLE ITSELF. THEY'RE THE ONES WE HAVE THE CHOI ARISE THERE TWENTY SEVENTEENS THEY WERE GIFTED TO US WITH THIRTY THOUSAND MILES ON THEM- OR LAST AND I HAVE NO ISSUE WITH THEM THEY THEY HANDLE REALLY WELL AND- I'M REALLY IMPRESSED WITH THE TECHNOLOGY ACTUALLY VERY GOOD THANK YOU AND- HYUNDAI MOTOR COMPANY- THIS IS DUMB AND YOU HAD- YOU DIDN'T HOLD BACK OBVIOUSLY YOU FEEL THAT WE NEED THE INFRASTRUCTURE MORE STATIONS OBVIOUSLY WITH THE POPULARITY IN THE- THE PRODUCTION THAT YOU ANTICIPATE- YOU'RE ASKING THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA REALLY TAKE A STRONG LOOK AT. THE EXPANSION OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE. COULD YOU COMMENT A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THAT. ABSOLUTELY AGAIN I THINK I THINK WE'RE ALL IN ALIGNMENT AND WE ALL KIND OF WANT THE SAME THING TO ADVANCE TO WORK THIS ZERO MISSION WORLD AND- I THINK IT WAS FOR TWO IS THAT COMMENTS FROM A SMALL RIGHT BEFORE I PRESENTED. JUST WANT TO REITERATE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES SO IT'S INFRASTRUCTURE STATION RELIABILITY. WE NOW IT'S THE WHOLE CHICKEN OR THE EGG DILEMMA BUT- WE SEE HUGE POTENTIAL WETHINK THERE'S MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS TO REACH OUR GOALS. WERE AS A COMPANY ARE COMMITTED TO MULTIPLE TECHNOLOGIES AND FUEL CELLS ONE OF OUR KEY PILLAR SO WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE. THE CUSTOMERS LOVE THEIR CARS LOVE THE EXPERIENCE AS WELL SO THEY CAN BUY ANOTHER ONE. AND OF COURSE TELL THEIR FRIENDS AND THE KIND OF EXPONENTIALLY GROWS INTO A LOT OF. FUEL CELLS ON THE ROAD. THANK YOU. OF BIGELOW ROCHA IF C. M. PRESIDENT FOUNDER OF. TOTAL TRANSPORTATION SERVICES YOU HAD MENTIONED. ABOUT YOUR RESEARCH IN IN- GERMANY. AND THE USAGE OUT THERE VERSUS HERE. DO YOU SEE. THAT ALL THESE OTHER COUNTRIES ARE FAR AHEAD OF US. AND WE'RE TO CATCH UP MODE. WHAT WHAT'S YOUR- YOUR VALUATION ON THAT. I THINK THAT THEY'VE BEEN AT IT LONGER- THEN WE HAVE BEEN. I YOU KNOW TO SAY THAT WE'RE GONNA CATCH UP MODE I THINK WOULD BE KIND OF- AT THIS SERVICE BECAUSE I THINK CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN KIND OF A LEADER YEAH KIND OF LEADING A LEADING EDGE. I JUST THINK THAT THE TECHNOLOGY IS CHAU COMPLICATED BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME SOME ADDITIONAL TIME TO GET US WHERE WE AS AN INDUSTRY ARE CONFIDENT THAT. WE'VE GOT A RELIABLE PRODUCTS. I THINK YOU WILL AGREE THAT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY HERE FOR A WORKFORCE TO DEVELOP TO BE ABLE TO BE THE TECHNICIANS OF THE FUTURE TO WORK ON THE CHARGING FUEL CELL- AUTOMOBILES AND- AND- SUVS AND OF COURSE AS YOU MENTIONED THE HEAVY HEAVIER TRUCKS- SO. TALKING ABOUT HEAVIER TRUCKS- REBECCA KAPLAN MADAM VICE MAYOR FROM OAKLAND- I AM SO EXCITED ABOUT HEARING WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND IN OAKLAND AND HOW YOU'VE TAKEN ON THE SERVICES OF. OF BRINGING HYDROGEN INTO OAKLAND I THINK I'M GOING TO ASK THE TO COME BY AND VISIT. AND SEE SOME OF THE- THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING THERE SO YOU CAN YOU COMMENT ON A LITTLE BIT ON THE FUTURE OF OAKLAND AND THE PARTNERSHIP YOU HAVE WITH THE ENERGY. WHEN IT COMES TO FUELCELL ENERGY. YES ABSOLUTELY NO WE ARE SO EXCITED ABOUT THE NEW PROGRAM THAT IS COMING WITH THE STATE GRANT SO THANK YOU TO ALL OF THE STATE LEADERS- INVOLVED IN THAT EFFORT. TO HAVE THE HYDROGEN FUELING STATION AND THIS IS SOMETHING I HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FOR OF FOR MULTIPLE YEARS WE RECOGNIZE THE MAJOR POLLUTION IMPACTS. AND I DO WANT TO SAY THAT I'M VERY HOPEFUL FOR THE TECHNOLOGY THERE IS ALSO AN ECONOMIES OF SCALE ISSUE SO WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE BOMBS WITH SOME OF THE INITIAL ROLLOUT OF SOME OF THE STATIONS. AND THINGS LIKE THAT YOU KNOW ONCE THEY'RE START BEING MORE OF THEM THE PRICE WILL COME DOWN THE RELIABILITY IMPROVES AND SO I THINK WE'RE REALLY AT THIS POINT IN THE CURVE. WHERE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT CAN MAKE A TRANSFORMATION NOT ONLY IN THE GRANT HELPING TO FUND ADDITIONAL VEHICLES BUT REALLY GET US PAST THAT ECONOMIES OF SCALE ISSUE WHERE THERE WILL BE ENOUGH HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS. AND ANOTHER- DEVELOPMENT OF HYDROGEN FUELING VEHICLES THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE MORE PEOPLE TRAINED IN HOW TO MAINTAIN THEM. THE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE ENOUGH FUELING STATIONS THE PEOPLE CAN RELIABLY GO TO THEM AND WITH THE TRUCKS THEY WILL BE ABLE TO SHOW THE RELIABILITY. BECAUSE COMPANIES WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING AT BUYING A TRUCK YOU KNOW THEY NEED A FAIRLY HIGH LEVEL OF CERTAINTY OF THE RELIABILITY OF THAT. AND SO ONCE WE ARE ABLE TO SHOW THIS LAUNCH WITH THE MANY VEHICLES IT REALLY CAN BE THE KIND OF TURNING POINT. THE WILL INCENTIVIZE MANY MORE PEOPLE TO DO IT AND ONCE MORE PEOPLE ARE BUYING THEM THE PRICE PER VEHICLE WILL GO DOWN BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIES OF SCALE. IN THE PRODUCTION AND YOU KNOW THE AND THANK YOU FOR ASKING THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TRUCKS UGH NO DISRESPECT FOR WORKING ON THE CARS THAT'S IMPORTANT TOO. BUT IN TERMS OF THE HUMAN HEALTH IMPACT REMEDYING THE HISTORIES OF ENVIRONMENTAL INJUSTICE MAKING SURE THAT WE YOUR ALSO DEALING WITH THE TRUCK. IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF THE ASTHMA AND THE OTHER NEGATIVE HEALTH HEALTH IMPACTS. OF TRUCK POLLUTION SO I'M REALLY GRATEFUL- THAT THAT IS PART OF THE VENTURE AS WELL. THANK YOU AND YOU DID MENTION BUSES AND BY THE WAY I DID HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY RIDE. ON A BUS HERE CHECKER MEADOW AND SMOOTH QUIET AND N. VERY FISSION. I LOVE THE EXPERIENCE LET'S GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON- TO PUBLIC COMMENTS AND THE PANELISTS. IF THERE'S A QUESTION FROM THE PUBLIC- THAT SEEMS TO BE IN YOUR CATEGORY WOULD YOU JUMP IN. AND TAKE CARE OF THAT FOR US. AS A REMINDER- LATER JOHN TO PLACE A OF A PUBLIC COMMENT PLEASE DIAL. THIS TOLL FREE NUMBER EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN SIX NINE TWO. EIGHT NINE FIVE THREE WHEN PROMPTED PLEASE USE THE CODE THE ACCESS CODE WHICH IS SEVEN OH FIVE. SIX NINE OH NINE. LET'S BE WITH ANY WITNESSES HERE IN THE GALLERY IN ROOM FORTY TWO OH THREE. AND PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND- WE WILL GO AHEAD AND OPEN THE FLOOR UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. THANK YOU SENATOR TERESA KIRK ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA AND PLEASE SPEAK. LOUD AND CLEAR CLOSE TO THE MICROPHONE TO WE CAN HEAR YOU. I'M LORD OUR GOD. THERESA COOK ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN COALITION I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS COMMITTEE HEARING TODAY- AND FOR THE TESTIMONY OF THOSE PRESENT WHAT I HEARD TODAY IS A NEED FOR A TRULY INTEGRATED TRANSPORTATION AND ENERGY SYSTEM. I THINK THAT'S LACKING IN POLICY AND WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF WORK TAT WE NEED TO DO VERY VERY QUICKLY TO COMPENSATE FOR THAT AND I THINK THIS IS A BIG STEP FORWARD TO ACHIEVE THOSE ENDS. YOU ASKED A MOMENT AGO ABOUT THE POLICIES THAT WE MIGHT PURSUE IN ORDER TO LOWER THE COST OF HYDROGEN FUEL AND SO I JUST WANT TO OFFER AND IT WAS MENTIONED BY ONE OF THOSE TESTIMONY. THAT JUST BE CURTAILED ENERGY BACK CALIFORNIA- YOU KNOW GROUNDS ARE GIVES AWAY OR PAYS YOU KNOW ARIZONA TO TAKE FROM US IF WE WERE TO TURN THAT INTO POWER TO CREATE HYDROGEN WE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FUEL TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND VEHICLES JUST LAST YEAR SO AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY. FOR THIS OTHERWISE CURTAILED POWER THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO EXPLORE PERHAPS WHOLESALE RATING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO THAT WE CAN YOU KNOW USE THAT TO MAKE A CHEAP AND RENEWABLE HYDROGEN FUEL. THE OTHER ITEM I'D THAT IS WORTH CONSIDERING IN THIS IS MORE RELATED TO THE AIR BE SCOPING PLAN AND THAT IS- UTILIZING THE CAPACITY CREDIT UNDER THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD FOR HEAVY DUTY FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE ASWELL IN TWENTY NINETEEN THAT CHANGE WAS ONLY MADE FOR LIGHT DUTY. AND JUST ONE OBSERVATION THAT I WANT TO MAKE THAT I THINK IS TENDS TO GET LOST IN THESE CONVERSATIONS IS SORT OF A SCHISM BETWEEN LIGHT DUTY AND HEAVY DUTY THAT DOESN'T ACTUALLY EXIST- IN TERMS OF THE WAY THAT THE MARKET ACTUALLY OPERATES. TODAY BY MEDIUM DUTY VEHICLES UP TO CLASSICS WILL BE UTILIZING LIGHT DUTY INFRASTRUCTURE AND SO WHEN WE TALK AS A BODY ABOUT NEEDING TO. DECARBONIZE TRANSPORTATION AND ARE MOST AFFECTED COMMUNITIES AND LAST MILE DELIVERY TRUCKS BEING SORT OF A PERPETRATOR OF THOSE EMISSIONS WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HYDROGEN FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE NOT ONLY SUPPORTING JUST MY VEHICLE WITH MY FAMILY. BUT YOU KNOW DELIVERIES AND THINGS ALONG. THOSE LINES- SO BEYOND NOT EVERY SAVE YOU SO MUCH AND LOOK FOR TO WORK WITH. THIS COMMITTEE AND APPRECIATE ALL THE SUPPORT AND WORK THAT WENT INTO THAT SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. JOHN. HELLO YEAH YOU KNOW. FIVE FIVE DO MY BEST. THE LITTLE. OKAY THANK YOU AND WELCOME. HELLO CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW. OKAY PROBLEM. HI SO LET'S TRY IT AGAIN GO AHEAD THANK YOU MISTER% CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR HOLDING THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON HYDROGEN TODAY IM SERVICE IM IN NELSON FROM THE CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN BUSINESS COUNCIL I. FULL HEARTEDLY AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT I TREE SAID JUST AT SAID FROM THE CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN COALITION- I'LL TOUCH ON JUST ANOTHER IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THIS CONVERSATION AGAIN ALL THE PANELISTS TODAY WERE AMAZING WE WORK DR JACK BAUER ALL THE TIME HE'S ONE OF OUR MEMBERS OF OUR ORGANIZATION AND E. I AND ENERGY INDEPENDENCE NOW IS ALSO OUR MEMBERS SO WE'RE VERY PROUD OF. THOSE MEMBERS IN THE PANELISTS THAT SPOKE TODAY JUST THE PROGRESS THAT'S BEING DONE IS GREAT- BUT I DO WANT TO TOUCH ON ONE IMPORTANT ASPECT THAT I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO REIN IN IS THAT MULTI UNIT HOUSING AND DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO CHARGING A LOT OF THE TIMES AND WE'RE GONNA BE REACHING THIS. MILESTONE THAT GOVERNOR NEWSOM HAD PUT FORWARD TO DO 1100% ZERO MISSION SALES BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE YOU REALLY DO NEED TO HAVE A LOT OF OPTIONS THAT WORK FOR EVERYONE AND SO THE HYDROGEN FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES REALLY DON'T REQUIRE PARKING FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME TO REFILL THEMSELVES IT'S JUST. AT A GAS STATION THAT YOU WOULD GO TO AND FILL IT UP YOURSELF I KNOW THIS BECAUSE I HAVE THE HONDA CLARITY RIGHT NOW AND IT'S ABOUT FIVE TO SIX MINUTES MAX A REVEALING TIME AND IS EXTREMELY CONVENIENT FOR ME AND I'M NOT EVEN A PARENT SO I CAN IMAGINE BEING A PARENT OR HAVING TWO JOBS HAVING TO GET FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE GOOD OPTIONS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THE FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES I KNOW THIS IS SPECIFICALLY A LIGHT DUTY CONVERSATION THAT I'M HAVING RIGHT NOW BUT I REALLY DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE NEED TO HAVE OPTIONS FOR CALIFORNIANS WHEN YOU KNOW 41% OF OUR GHG EMISSIONS ARE DUE TO TRANSPORTATION. SO I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE BENEFITS OF THE FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES IS THAT YOU CAN REVEAL SO QUICKLY AND THAT IT COULD BE VERY ACCESSIBLE BUT WE REALLY DO NEED THAT INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WAS TALKED ABOUT SO MUCH TODAY IN ORDER TO ENABLE SO MANY OF THE CALIFORNIANS TO REFUEL THEIR ONLY THREE STATIONS. AND SACRAMENTO RIGHT NOW AND SO I DO TO PLAN OUT MY ROW. AND I HAVE TO MAKE SURE I CAN. MAKE IT TO AND FROM. I'D LIKE TO SEE A LOT MORE OF MY NEIGHBORS BEING ABLE TO HAVE THAT ACCESS- AND MEET THAT GOAL SO WE COULD HAVE ALL TYPES OF VEHICLES. TO ASSIST US IN REACHING OUR GHG EMISSIONS GOALS. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING THIS. COMMITTEE HEARING TODAY WE REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING. ALL THE OTHER TOPICS THAT HYDROGEN CAN ASSIST WITH- IN THE OTHER SECTORS TO DECARBONISE CALIFORNIA SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. AND NEXT UP. YES BILLERICAY THE CALIFORNIA FUEL CELL PARTNERSHIP AND I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE PANEL OR EVEN THE SPEAKERS BEFORE ME OR THAT TOPICS YOU COVERED IT ALL VERY WELL I WANT TO FOCUS ON SOMETHING VERY PARTICULAR TO CALIFORNIA AND A LEADER POSITION WE BUILT. THE ZERO EMISSION. MOSHE MOVEMENT I REALLY STARTED HERE IN CALIFORNIA OVER THIRTY YEARS AGO IT DOES HAVE REGULATION IT IS IT HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL NOT ONLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT AROUND THE WORLD SETTING THAT TONE AND THIS IS A HUGE MOMENT FOR US ALL AS WE REALLY SEE THE SUCCESS OF BOTH BATTERIES AND FUEL CELLS GOING FORWARD BOTH CLIMATE CHANGE AND EVERYTHING ELSE HAPPENING WE SEE THAT URGENCY WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH WE NEED MORE OF THIS ON THE GROUND. SOMETHING THAT WAS BARELY TOUCHED UPON EARLIER- DR MARTINEZ FROM CARB TALKED ABOUT THE SELF SUFFICIENCY STUDY. WE NEED TO MOVE AWAY FROM SUBSIDIZING THESE MARKETS FOR EVER AND BUILDING THEM INTO SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY AND DEMAND MARKETS. THAT THE AVERAGE PERSON CAN GO OUT AND TAKE THESE VEHICLES OFF THE SHOW ROOM FLOOR AND LIVE THEIR LIVES JUST WITH ZERO EMISSIONS. THE LIGHT DUTY HYDROGEN FUEL CELL VEHICLE REPORT TO SELF SUFFICIENT SUFFICIENCY DRAFT FROM CARP IS THE FIRST IDENTIFIED PATHWAY. IN THE WORLD. FOR A ZERO EMISSION MARKET. CAN'T STATE THAT ENOUGH I'LL GO ON A LIMB AND SAY MAYBE YOU NEED AN ENTIRE HEARING SET TO THAT TOPIC. BECAUSE THE MOVEMENT THERE IN LIGHT DUTY WILL ALSO BE LEVERAGED ENABLE THE HEAVY DUTY MARKETS AND THEN INTO SOME OF THE OTHER MARKET OPPORTUNITIES FOR HYDROGEN THE DOCTOR BROWER MENTIONED. AS WELL AND AS WE LOOK AROUND THE WORLD RIGHT NOW CALIFORNIA'S BEEN THAT LEADER FOR DECADES. HOWEVER IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AROUND THE WORLD EVERYONE'S PICKING UP ON HYDROGEN TURN OVER THIRTY COUNTRIES WHO HAVE INTEGRATED HYDROGEN. INTO THEIR ENERGY PLANTS NOT JUST FOR THE ENVIRONMENT BUT FOR THE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES. WE WERE THE BIGGEST WE WERE THE LEADER WE'RE LOSING GROUND WE NEED THAT NOT FOR THE BOASTING NATURE. BUT FOR THOSE ENVIRONMENTAL URGENT BENEFITS WE NEED NOW. AND THE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES THAT COME WITH IT. SO CONSIDER HOW THAT WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE ALL OF THESE ZERO EMISSION MARKETS GET TO A STATE. WHERE IT'S SURE SUPPLY AND DEMAND WE'RE BUILDING ON A MARKET POTENTIAL AND THAT'S WHAT THE SAID REGULATION WAS THIRTY YEARS AGO THE INTENTION WAS. SHOW US HOW TO BUILD THE MARKET GET THERE SO WE CAN GET OUT OF THIS SUBSIDY OPPORTUNITY AND OUT OF THAT AND INTO A REAL MARKET SO. JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE INCREDIBLE REPORT LOOKING FOR THAT DRAFT BEING FINALIZED REALLY SOON IT'S BEEN MANY MONTHS. AND THEN TALKING ABOUT THAT AS THE WAY WE TRANSITION CALIFORNIA. AND THE REST OF THE WORLD THE ZERO EMISSIONS. THANK YOU VERY GOOD THANK YOU. AND YOU FOR YOUR TEST- WE APPRECIATE HAVING YOU HERE TODAY IN SACRAMENTO- THAT SEAT NOW I THINK WOULD LIKE TO GO AHEAD. AND GET ON TO THE TELEPHONE LINES SO WOULD LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE HERE WHO'S FOR PICK THAT PARTICIPATED SHOULD NOW VIA THE TELEPHONE CONFERENCE SERVICE MODERATOR. LET'S GO AHEAD AND OPEN UP THE LINES AND PROP INDIVIDUALS WAITING TO PROVIDE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT AND WE WILL BEGIN MODERATOR. WITH YOU'LL GET A HOLD OF ONE PLACE. LA GERMAN IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENTS PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. YOUR TONE INDICATING PLACING QUEUE NUMBER WILL PROVIDE YOU A NUMBER AND I WILL ANNOUNCE YOU BY THAT NUMBER ONCE AGAIN IF YOU'D LIKE TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT. PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. AND THEN JUST YOU ARE AWARE WE DO HAVE ABOUT SIX IN THE QUEUE. ALL RIGHT. GO AHEAD MODERATOR LET THE FIRST ONE ON. WE WILL START WITH- NUMBER SEVENTY THREE PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES GO AHEAD WE CAN HEAR YOU SPEAK UP- SO WE CAN ALL HEAR YOU. SURE SENATOR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. MY NAME'S MARK MOBLEY. AND I AM- RETIRED TAXPAYER. AND I'VE BEEN DRIVING A HYDROGEN FUEL CELL CAR FOR FIVE YEARS. AND I LOVE IT I PURCHASED MINE. FIVE YEARS AGO. AND I HAVE- GOT A LOAN FROM A CREDIT UNION- SO IT'S BEEN FIVE YEARS AND FORTY FOUR THOUSAND MILES OF. ZERO EMISSION DRIVING AND I'M ONE OF THE APARTMENT DWELLERS- SO. IN MY CASE I COULDN'T PLUG IN WITH A BATTERY ELECTRIC. BUT HYDROGEN'S WORKED PERFECTLY FOR ME. I JUST WANT TO SAY. IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT IT. THE PRICES ARE DEFINITELY COME DOWN. ARE YOU CAN GET A CERTIFIED PREOWNED- FOR ABOUT A QUARTER OF WHAT I PAID FIVE YEARS AGO. OKAY THANK YOU MY WRITER NEXT ONE. THANK YOU MY WRITER NEXT CALLER NUMBERS SEVENTY SEVEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR ARCHULETA FOR HER YOUR PROFOUND LEADERSHIP AND THE HYDROGEN POLICY BASED ON THE BALLOT QUESTION OF COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ROXANNE ABOUT MOMMY AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE WATSON ARJUN ALLIANCE JUST LIKE MY COLLEAGUES HAVE. MENTIONED BEFORE THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A GREAT NEED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE NOT BEING HYGIENE STATIONS EXPLICITLY WOULD ALSO PRO PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION YOUR FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING ON AS HE DISTRICTS HERE AND ACTUALLY FIX WITH ME WHICH WE'RE WORKING WITH YOU ON YOU ACTUALLY OUR COMBINATION OF THOSE- TO ACTUALLY ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE THIS YEAR. THE OTHER THING THAT I WANT TO SAY AS AN ENTITY THAT IS WORKING IN THE WESTERN STATE I WILL TELL YOU CALIFORNIA. I'M THAT IS RIGHT I. THOUGHT WE CAN MENTION. WERE IT NOT LEADERS IN YOUR SPACE. WE ARE MOVING AROUND AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT. I Y. MORE WITH PRODUCERS IN THE WEST STATE THAT WANTED. YOU'LL BE INTRODUCED WHAT YOU THINK SHE CAN. WHY ARE WE NOT PRODUCE. A WIRE WE NOT. I CAN ACT IN THE STATE FOR ACTIVITIES THAT ARE GOING IN THIS THAT WE USING TAX DOLLARS. TO ACTUALLY BY THE VEHICLES SHOULD BE GOOD AND THINK WE SHOULD BE PROMOTE THE. ALTHOUGH I WANT TO PAY THAT THERE ARE OTHER. LIKE THAT THEY DON'T. ORG HONDA. I'M NOT A CRIMINAL LAW. BUT CERTAIN- THINGS I MENTIONED THAT ARE PROMOTE HIGHER POLICY. THAT WILL POINT I BEHIND. SO I WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU. STOP LOOKING. YOU HAVE TO CLEAN LOOK AT THE- WORLD LOOK AT THE THAT. SHOULD YOU KNOW BEHIND. ONE GATHERED RETOOL. YEAH ARE YOUR LEGISLATION. DOING WALGREENS. CALIFORNIA YOU FOR YOUR CALL NEXT CALLER PLEASE. NEXT TO GO TO NUMBERS FIVE PLEASE GO AHEAD. CAN YOU HEAR ME OK. YES YEAH- THANK YOU FOR HOSTING US TODAY IS FANTASTIC ANALYSTS WERE FANTASTIC SORRY COULDN'T BE THERE IN PERSON MY NAME IS JACK TICKLE I'M ONE OF THE CO FOUNDERS OF GREEN GREAT ANCHOR LOCAL SAN RAMON COMPANY FOR ABOUT A TEN YEAR OLD COMPANY THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING ON KEY TECHNOLOGIES AND SOLUTIONS FOR CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCY PROJECTS AND ONE OF THOSE REALLY IMPORTANT AREAS THAT WE'VE BEEN FOCUSED ON. FOR A LONG TIME IS GREEN I. AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO FORM A GROUP THAT. REHIRED AND HAS MADE A LOT OF. ADVANCEMENTS IN THE MOST RECENT FIVE YEARS. AND TO PLEASE THINK ABOUT RETIRED GENERAL STORE IN WIND ENERGY AMONG OTHERS LIKE GEOTHERMAL AND OTHER CLEAN ENERGY IS BUT PRIMARILY CAN BE SOLAR AND WIND ENERGY WHICH IS STORED FOR USE AT A DIFFERENT TIME AND PLACE. AND THIS IS SO FUNDAMENTAL BECAUSE THIS CAN MODEL ALL OF THE EXISTING BENEFIT OF OUR GASOLINE AND CARBON BASED SUPPLY CHAIN WHILE PROVIDING CARBON FREE ENERGY SO. THIS PROVIDE THE TYPE OF CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCY THAT WE REALLY NEED FOR MOBILITY AND OUR ELECTRIC GRID. BECAUSE NOW THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE EVER PRESENT RISK OF PS PS WHERE THE LECTURE UTILITIES MAY TURN OFF THE ELECTRICAL POWER LINES FOR OUR SAFETY. DUE TO THE THREAT OF WILDFIRE. IN HYDROGEN PROVIDE US WAY I'LL HAVE ENERGY LETTER NOT DEPENDENT ON OUR ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION TRANSMISSION SYSTEM SO IN CONTRAST A BATTERY THANKS RADIO CALL- WORLD WITH REQUIRE A VERY STRONG EMPHASIS ON THE- LECTER TRANSMISSION SYSTEM. AND WERE REALLY JUST NOT THERE YET. WILL NOT BEING ABLE TO- HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY WHETHER A GREEN HYDROGEN ECONOMY IS VERY IMPORTANT TO US IN TERMS OF OUR OUR CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCY REMEMBER A LOT OF TIMES SPOKE LIKE TO CHARGE BATTERIES AT NIGHT. AND NOT FOR THE CONVENIENCE BECAUSE LONG CHARGE TIME- BY THE WAY THE SUN IS DOWN. SO THAT'S A WHOLE NOTHER ISSUE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A BATTERY CENTRIC SOLUTION TRULY BECOME. A CLEAN ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEM SO. THE OTHER THING I'D LIKE TO. KNOW IS THAT WE HAD EXCELLENT STRIDE. A QUICK MATH FOR HYDROGEN IN THE ROLLOUT OF THE HYDROGEN GAS STATIONS. AS WELL AS THE VEHICLES WHICH ARE COMPLETELY HI NOMINAL. SO OUR EMPHASIS THIS EVEN DATES BACK TO THE DELETE PROGRAMS GOING BACK INTO THE EIGHTIES AND NINETIES AND EARLY TWO THOUSAND. THE EMPHASIS WAS ALWAYS ON THE DEMAND SIDE AND WE HAVE NOT YET SEEN THE EMPHASIS FOR- IN. STRONG SUPPORT PROGRAM FOR REGULATIONS AND INCENTIVES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SUPPLY SIDE SO THAT'S WHERE GREEN GREEN CONSTRUCTING. IT ON SOLVING THE RENEWABLE HYDROGEN SUPPLY SIDE ISSUES WE HAVE PATENTED SOLUTIONS. THAT WILL REALLY. REDUCE THE COST FOR DELIVERED RENEWABLE HYDROGEN ATSCALE AND WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO TELL YOU THAT WE HAVE A RENEWABLE HYDROGEN CAPACITY. RESERVATION PROGRAM- GAS STATION OWNER WE OWNERS AND ANYBODY LOOKING TO. THEIR TRANSFER OR THE LIGHT GRID. THE NEXT YEARS CAN CONTACT BY UP THE START PLAN FOR WINTER WHERE THEY'LL NEED A CERTAIN DEGREE OF HYDROGEN FUEL DELIVERED VERY GOOD. FOR YOUR OVERALL GATHERED REDUCE THE BEST PLAN. TO HELP ACHIEVE THE ZERO EMISSION FUTURE THAT WE ALL VERY GOOD. FOR YOUR THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND LAZY GERMAN YOU'VE GOT TO MANAGE. EACH SHOW NEXT CALLER. NEXT IS NUMBER FIFTY PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE GET HERE YES OKAY THANK YOU- THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY TODAY- MY NAME IS NICHOLA SHE'LL GET- WALKING I'VE GOT ON THE STOCK MARKET BUT THE MOTOR CITY BY ONE NATIONAL WHAT I BELIEVE- I'VE BEEN DRIVING NOW.

YEAH I GET TO GET A QUESTION ABOUT THE BEAUTIFUL CAR QUITE OFTEN ON THE IDEA WOULD PUBLIC- DO YOU GO TO. PUT ANY PRETTY GOOD BECAUSE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CUT DOWN WALK THE GUY- CATHOLIC KOCH SINCE THE DRIVING RANGES ABOUT THE ON THE STREET THE TIME IS THE SAME ACCORDING TO THE CENTER HOBBY THERE ARE. YOU OUT YEAH IT ALSO BE OB. TO FOR ANYBODY YOU KNOW THAT THEIR NAY UP- OUR ENERGY TO RUN ON. ON THAT ARE AGREE WITH IT EVEN IF THAT WAS AT THE LOOK. PEAK AND I WILL TO DO. WE DON'T ON THE INPUT THAT ONE TO REACH THAT ARE YOU KNOW THAT MAKE A DEEPER. PRACTICE SCHOOL. ABLE TO BUY THE HOUSE GET ON BOARD THAT YOU. ONE COOLEY NOT PROVIDE. DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENTAL ON THE THING THAT I THOUGHT. HE DID BEFORE YOU COULD BE. ABU THE CABLE. WELL LET'S GO BECAUSE ON THE OP. ON- THE RANGE ON THE ARE. THANK YOU- CENDRARS LAWN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CHRIS PEOPLE I AM AN ELECTED MEMBER OF THE ALAMEDA CONTRA COSTA TRANSIT DISTRICT BOARD AND I WANT TO AMPLIFY A LITTLE BETTER ON. WHAT MY VICE MAYOR AND MY FORMER COLLEAGUE ON HE BOARD. REBECCA KAPLAN HAD THIS SAY ABOUT OUR HYDROGEN FUEL CELL PROGRAM- AS YOU MENTIONED WE HAVE BEEN OPERATING HYDROGEN FUEL CELL BUSES. FOR ABOUT TWENTY YEARS NOW WE RECENTLY ADDED TO THAT LEAD A SMALL CLEAN WHICH IS GETTING BIGGER OF BATTERY ELECTRIC BOXES. AND WE ARE OPERATING THE FIRST IN THE WORLD FORMAL COMPARISON BETWEEN. FUEL CELL ELECTRIC BOXES BATTERY ELECTRIC BUSES DIESEL ELECTRIC BUSES AND DIESEL BOXES- IT'S BEEN NOT BEING OPERATED BY AC TRANSIT. AND ANALYZED AND MONITORED BY EN ROUTE THE NATIONAL RENEWABLE ENERGY LAB. AND TEAM OUT OF STANFORD UNIVERSITY. SO THE FIRST WHO ARE BORN ON THAT WAS PUBLISHED- A FEW WEEKS AGO THE NEXT ONE IS DUE IN DECEMBER AND THE FORMAL ACADEMIC PAPER THE BILL IN ABOUT TWO YEARS. SO THAT WILL PROVIDE MUCH INFORMATION BOTH WERE GRANTED AGENCIES WHO ARE INTERESTED. IN WHAT SORT OF A LIKE GREG. ALL CONTINUES AND FOR ALL OTHER HEAVY DUTY USERS. NAME SECOND THING I'D LIKE TO COMMENT ON IS THE DRAMATIC DROP IN PRICE OVER THOSE TWENTY YEARS- THE- LAWSUIT WE ARE BUYING TODAY COSTS LESS THAN HALF WHAT THOSE ORIGINAL BOXES. DID AND AS THEY COME IS THE QUANTITY GROW WE EXPECT THE PRICE WILL DROP DOWN AS WELL. ENGENDER WE REGULARLY USE TOWARDS OF OUR FACILITIES I DID ONE YESTERDAY AND WE DID ONE TODAY AND SO WE WOULD LOG. TO APPROACH YOU ON A TOUR OF OUR YOU ONLY AND. PRODUCTION I DO CHEN COULD NOT IT'S ALL THESE ANYTIME YOU WANT COME DOWN THANK YOU VERY MUCH VERY GOOD THANK YOU FOR THE IMPACT. AND SEND A COPY OF YOUR REPORT FINDING A IT'S GOOD. NEXT CALL PLEASE. NEXT IS NUMBER SEVENTY SIX PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS SERRA GRIS AND I'M CALLING ON BEHALF OF JUSTICE AND I'D LIKE TO THANK FOUNDER ARCHULETA FOR BRINGING THE DEATH PENALTY GATHER ON VERY INFORMATIVE. MY COMMENT TODAY IS- EARNS- ALL THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE- COULDN'T AWARE OF ONE- VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT COULD- UNDERMINE- NOBLE HAIGER DAN'S ABILITY TO DELIVER AND BAYERN MENTAL BENEFITS TO CALIFORNIA AND THAT IS CURRENTLY. COMPANIES THAT PRODUCE HYDROGEN ARE CLAIMING THAT THAT HYDROGEN IS RENEWABLE EVEN WHEN IT'S PRODUCED USING NATURAL GAS THROUGH A PROCESS CALLED STEAM REFORMATION- AND- THEY'RE ABLE TO DO THAT THROUGH THE LEGAL FICTION OF HERRING NATURAL GAS. BOB WHAT CONTRACTS FOR- THINGS LIKE GAS FROM A CATTLEMAN FROM OUT OF STATE FARMS- AND THE PROCESS OF CREATING THIS HYDROGEN FROM NATURAL GAS- IS OFTEN LOCATED WHERE- WILL REFINERIES AND A METS VERY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF NANAK AND OTHER HEALTH HARMING POLLUTION IN THE SAME COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ALREADY OVERBURDENED WITH POLLUTION FROM THE REFINERY SECTOR- THIS IS AN OVERSIGHT IN OUR CURRENT POLICY IS THAT THE- LEGISLATURE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY THANKS. AND I HOPE IT WILL EXPLORE DOING SO IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CALL NEXT CALLER PLEASE. AT THIS TIME WE HAVE NO OTHERS IN OUR QUEUE PLEASE CONTINUE. A MODERATOR WOULD YOU CHECK ONE MORE TIME SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE ELSE ON THE LINE. ABSOLUTELY AND IF ANYONE ELSE ON THE LINE WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENTS PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. AGAIN ONE ZERO FOR PUBLIC COMMENTS- AT THIS TIME THERE ARE NO OTHERS IN OUR QUEUE VERY GOOD THANK YOU I'D LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE WHO PARTICIPATED IN THIS- FIRST SELECT COMMITTEE ON HYDROGEN ENERGY CALIFORNIA IS A TREASURE CHEST OF ENERGY AND THE GOAL OF THIS SELECT COMMITTEE IS TO ENSURE THAT HYDROGEN HAS ITS PLACE IN THAT TREASURE CHEST OF ENERGY WE KNOW THAT HYDROGEN WILL PLAY A ROLE IN THE HELPING AND HELPING CALIFORNIA TRANSITION TO ZERO CARBON. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO USING THIS SELECT COMMITTEE AS A CALTRANS FOR THE CONVERSATION INFORMATION ON HYDROGEN WE HAVE A LOT TO WORK TO DO NO DOUBT BUT TOGETHER IN CALIFORNIA AND AS CALIFORNIANS WE CAN ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING THANK YOU ALL FOR THE AND THE ALL THE INDIVIDUALS WHO CALLED IN TODAY FOR THE PUBLIC COMMENTS AND TESTIMONY AND- IF YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO CALL IN. VIA THE TELEPHONE ARE YOU PLEASE YOU CAN SUBMIT YOUR COMMENTS OR SUGGESTIONS IN WRITING- TO THE WEBSITE OR HERE IN THE STATE CAPITAL- YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS DIGESTION WILL BE PUT ON THE RECORD TO INCLUDE ANY TESTIMONY AND- ANY HEARING THAT YOU YOU HAVE PERTAINING TO THE- THE HEARING TODAY WE'D LIKE TO THANK YOU AND APPRECIATE YOUR PARTICIPATION WE WOULD LIKE TO- HANG ON JUST ONE SECOND. AND I'D LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE WHO AND THEIR PATIENT FOR COOPERATION TODAY AND- BEFORE WE CONCLUDE THE AGENDA I'D LIKE TO GO AHEAD TURN IT OVER.

ADVICE SURE GO RIGHT AHEAD WITH YOUR CLOTHES REMARKS IN. WILL GO DOWN FOR MY SCREEN I WAS AT. EXCELLENT THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR I STILL APPRECIATE THIS IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY I DID WANT TO SHARE THAT I. HAVE POSTED INTO THE ZOOM CHAT THE LINKS. FOR THOSE WONDERFUL REPORTS THAT MY COLLEAGUE CHRIS PEOPLE'S FROM THE AC TRANSIT BOARD MENTIONED ABOUT THE COMPARISON OF THE DIFFERENT BUSES. AND THE GREAT RELIABILITY OF THE HYDROGEN BUSES AND HOW MUCH THEIR PRICES COME DOWN AND I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. THAT WE CAN INVEST IN A WAY THAT WILL TURN THE COST CURVE. GOING FORWARD I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE CENTER FOR TRANSPORTATION AND THE ENVIRONMENT WHICH IS AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN THE BRINGING OF THE HYDROGEN FUEL CELL TRUCKS. TO THE PORT OF OAKLAND AND I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT WE ARE ALSO WORKING ON ONE OF THE SPEAKERS MENTIONED THE CLASSIFIED IN SIX TRUCKS. THE DELIVERY TRUCKS THE TYPES ONE MIGHT ASSOCIATE WITH FEDEX OR UPS WE ARE WORKING TO HAVE HYDROGEN FUEL IN FOR THOSE AS WELL AND TO MAKE THAT AN OPTION. AND WE HAVE BEGUN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HYDROGEN FUEL CELL FOR RAIL- IN PARTNERSHIP WITH VALLEY LINK- WHICH IS A RAIL PROJECTS- WITH ALAMEDA COUNTY AND OUR NEIGHBORING COUNTIES. AND SO- I BELIEVE THOSE ARE COMEDIANS WHO SAID GIVE ME ONE FIXED POINT FROM WHICH I CAN MOVE THE EARTH. AND ONCE WE HAVE THE SUFFICIENT FUELING STATIONS THAT CREATE THE CONFIDENCE OF BEING ABLE TO USE THIS TECHNOLOGY THEN MORE AND MORE USERS CAN AND WILL ADOPT IT. AND LASTLY WE WOULD LOVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO BRING SUSTAINABLE LOCALLY PRODUCED HYDROGEN IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR WASTE WATER UTILITY AND THE PORT. WORKING TOGETHER AND SO THAT YOU CAN BE PART OF OUR FUTURE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME. YOU'RE GOOD THANK YOU LET ME GO OUT. OF THE WAY WE- UP THE LADDER HERE SO LET'S GO WITH THE MEASURE TO RUSSIA. YOU CAN. GIVE US SOME CLOSING REMARKS AND WILL GO THE OTHER WAY. SO MICHELLE ROSS OF PLACE.

THANK YOU SO MUCH I DO APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND- CONVENING THIS I WANTED TO MAKE ONE LAST COMMENT ON THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FACT THAT WE HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME TODAY TALKING ABOUT TRANSPORTATION APPLICATIONS BUT WE NEED TO ENGENDER. ZERO EMISSIONS IN EVERY APPLICATION AND HYDROGEN OFFERS OPPORTUNITIES AND FEATURES THAT YOU CAN'T GET WITH ANYTHING ELSE THAT IS ZERO EMISSIONS FOR STATIONARY POWER FOR INDUSTRY AND WE'RE REALLY DIFFICULT TO DECARBONISE APPLICATIONS LIKE STEEL AND CEMENT AND THINGS LIKE THIS- AND THAT WE MUST ALSO DECARBONISE SO WHEN I MAKE SURE THAT OUR STATE ALSO LEADS IN THESE AREAS AS WELL- SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU AND LIKE TO THANK STAFF AND EVERYONE WHO PARTICIPATED AND BUT IN THIS MEETING TOGETHER AND I THANK YOU I'D CERTAINLY LIKE TO THANK.
