00:39:14.618 --> 00:39:22.760
SIR- ONE OF THE PRINCIPLE. WE

00:39:22.827 --> 00:39:24.929
WILL CALL A BARRIER TO. CRUEL

00:39:24.995 --> 00:39:28.332
BUT ONE OF THE LARGEST FACTORS

00:39:28.399 --> 00:39:29.200
INVOLVED IN THE APPROVAL

00:39:29.266 --> 00:39:31.469
PROCESS IS THE CURRICULUM

00:39:31.535 --> 00:39:34.004
DEVELOPMENT- THIS IS AN

00:39:34.071 --> 00:39:37.308
INCREDIBLY INTRICATE PROCESS-

00:39:37.374 --> 00:39:40.144
AS YOU KNOW YOU MAY KNOW THAT-

00:39:40.211 --> 00:39:42.313
CALIFORNIA BOTH OF US IN THE

00:39:42.379 --> 00:39:44.949
BRN. OUR CURRICULUM AND

00:39:45.015 --> 00:39:47.017
REQUIREMENTS. IT IS QUITE A BIT

00:39:47.084 --> 00:39:50.521
MORE STRINGENT M. AND LARGER

00:39:50.588 --> 00:39:53.624
THAN MOST OF THE OTHER STATES-

00:39:53.691 --> 00:39:57.394
THIS IS OLD AND AGAIN I WILL.

00:39:57.461 --> 00:39:58.996
CERTAINLY ADMIT THAT IT TAKES A

00:39:59.063 --> 00:40:00.698
LONG TIME I THINK GENERALLY

00:40:00.765 --> 00:40:03.501
SPEAKING- FROM THE TIME OF A

00:40:03.567 --> 00:40:06.170
SCHOOL PROGRAM. SENDS A LETTER

00:40:06.237 --> 00:40:07.571
OF INTENT TO THE TIME THAT IS

00:40:07.638 --> 00:40:09.373
ACTUALLY ACCEPTING STUDENTS IS

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.342
WELL IN EXCESS OF TWO YEARS AND

00:40:11.408 --> 00:40:13.711
I REALIZE THAT THAT IS NOT-

00:40:13.778 --> 00:40:17.348
GOOD- RIGHT NOW I THINK THE-

00:40:17.414 --> 00:40:18.983
THERE IS THE STAFFING ISSUES

00:40:19.049 --> 00:40:21.619
THAT- ALREADY SEES WE HAVE SIX

00:40:21.685 --> 00:40:25.289
ANY SEASON ONE SUPERVISING. NEC

00:40:25.356 --> 00:40:27.658
AND THEIR WORK IS SPLIT UP

00:40:27.725 --> 00:40:30.461
AMONG THE WORK WITH A LOT AT

00:40:30.528 --> 00:40:33.397
THE ACTIVE SCHOOLS- WHICH LAST

00:40:33.464 --> 00:40:34.665
YEAR WAS A VERY VERY LARGE

00:40:34.732 --> 00:40:37.401
WORKLOAD. AND THEN ALSO TAKING

00:40:37.468 --> 00:40:40.805
ON- I THINK THREE OR FOR EACH

00:40:40.871 --> 00:40:42.473
OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS ON

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:45.009
PROPOSAL LIST IT TAKES A WHILE

00:40:45.075 --> 00:40:46.577
BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF

00:40:46.644 --> 00:40:48.479
INFORMATION THAT. THEY NEED TO

00:40:48.546 --> 00:40:50.581
IT AND ADELINE AND WORK WITH

00:40:50.648 --> 00:40:53.484
THAT PROPOSING PROGRAM IS

00:40:53.551 --> 00:40:55.719
ENORMOUS AND VERY DENSE VERY

00:40:55.786 --> 00:40:57.555
VERY COMPLEX AND THERE'S A

00:40:57.621 --> 00:41:01.091
NUMBER OF LOCAL FACTORS

00:41:01.158 --> 00:41:02.593
ACADEMIC FACTORS. SO IT'S NOT A

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:05.729
PERFECT SYSTEM SO ONE OF THE

00:41:05.796 --> 00:41:07.298
FACTORS WE DID DO WHEN YOU

00:41:07.364 --> 00:41:08.132
MENTION THIS OF COURSE AS WELL

00:41:08.199 --> 00:41:10.034
IS THAT THERE IS A FINANCIAL

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:15.406
ISSUE- ONE B. SOURCE LESS. WE

00:41:15.472 --> 00:41:18.108
HAVE THE BOOK THE UNDERSTANDING

00:41:18.175 --> 00:41:22.046
THE THEORY AT LEAST THAT SCHOOL

00:41:22.112 --> 00:41:25.049
PROPOSED PROGRAMS. AND REALLY

00:41:25.115 --> 00:41:28.252
AS A PLACE HLDER AND WERE THEY

00:41:28.319 --> 00:41:30.788
REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE UPFRONT

00:41:30.855 --> 00:41:33.190
PROCESS YOU FEEL LIKE WE ARE

00:41:33.257 --> 00:41:36.760
AND DOES. IT MAKE A- DELAY THEM

00:41:36.827 --> 00:41:38.329
FROM PUTTING THEIR NAMES INTO

00:41:38.395 --> 00:41:40.531
THE ON THE LIST UNTIL THEY'RE

00:41:40.598 --> 00:41:42.800
MUCH FURTHER ALONG BUT ONE OF

00:41:42.867 --> 00:41:44.168
THE THINGS I THINK WE WANT TO

00:41:44.235 --> 00:41:46.570
LOOK AT AND THE BOARD AND THE

00:41:46.637 --> 00:41:48.906
STAFF WILL BE. LOOKING THROUGH

00:41:48.973 --> 00:41:51.075
A NUMBER OF SCENARIOS MOSTLY

00:41:51.141 --> 00:41:56.113
HAVING TO DO WITH- KIND OF.

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:58.716
REEVALUATING AND MAKING STAGES

00:41:58.782 --> 00:42:01.218
AND PHASES OR IN THE APPROVAL

00:42:01.285 --> 00:42:03.754
PROCESS MAYBE PROVIDING MORE OF

00:42:03.821 --> 00:42:05.522
A TRIAGE OR PRE APPROVAL

00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:08.359
PROCESS- THERE'S A NUMBER OF

00:42:08.425 --> 00:42:08.959
OPTIONS OPTIONS WE WANT TO

00:42:09.026 --> 00:42:11.829
EXPLORE HERE- BUT ALL AIMED AT

00:42:11.896 --> 00:42:14.398
THE IDEA OF. GETTING PROGRAMS

00:42:14.465 --> 00:42:19.970
pTIME REMEMBER THAT. OUR PRIMARY

00:42:20.037 --> 00:42:21.972
MISSION OF COURSE IS CONSUMER

00:42:22.039 --> 00:42:24.808
SAFETY- WE MUST MAKE CERTAIN

00:42:24.875 --> 00:42:25.576
THAT THE SCHOOLS THAT ARE

00:42:25.643 --> 00:42:28.279
APPROVED. ARE QUALIFIED AND

00:42:28.345 --> 00:42:31.415
ARE. WELL STAFFED THEY HAVE

00:42:31.482 --> 00:42:32.416
ACCESS TO ALL THE CRITICAL

00:42:32.483 --> 00:42:35.085
RESOURCES- CLINICAL PLACEMENTS

00:42:35.152 --> 00:42:37.922
FACULTY FACILITIES- SO LIKE I

00:42:37.988 --> 00:42:38.756
SAID IT'S A VERY INTRICATE

00:42:38.822 --> 00:42:41.358
PROCESS. BUT- WE'D CERTAINLY BE

00:42:41.425 --> 00:42:44.461
WERE VERY WELCOMING TO. INPUT

00:42:44.528 --> 00:42:46.297
FROM THE MEMBERS ON THE

00:42:46.363 --> 00:42:50.534
COMMITTEE STAFF. THANK YOU. NO

00:42:50.601 --> 00:42:51.602
I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR CANDOR

00:42:51.669 --> 00:42:53.570
QUITE FRANKLY AND I UNDERSTAND

00:42:53.637 --> 00:42:55.306
YOUR CONCERNS AND I CERTAINLY

00:42:55.372 --> 00:42:57.374
HAVE JOTTED A FEW NOTES DOWN

00:42:57.441 --> 00:42:58.108
AND CAN SEE HOW SOME OF YOUR

00:42:58.175 --> 00:43:00.778
ISSUES- COULD BE VERY VERY

00:43:00.844 --> 00:43:02.479
DETRIMENTAL TO DOING YOUR JOB.

00:43:02.546 --> 00:43:03.547
I JUST DO WANT TO SAY THAT ON

00:43:03.614 --> 00:43:05.015
THE ON THE SCHOOL PERSPECTIVE I

00:43:05.082 --> 00:43:07.151
THINK IF THERE WAS A WAY. THAT

00:43:07.217 --> 00:43:09.153
WE COULD GIVE THEM SOME SENSE

00:43:09.219 --> 00:43:11.622
OF A PROCESS A TIMELINE. IT

00:43:11.689 --> 00:43:12.756
WOULD ALLOW THEM TO PLAN AS

00:43:12.823 --> 00:43:14.058
WELL EVEN THOUGH YOU FOLKS ARE

00:43:14.124 --> 00:43:15.893
WORKING THROUGH YOUR PROCESSES

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:16.493
AND DOING EVERYTHING THAT YOU

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:18.195
NEED TO DO ON YOUR END. I FEEL

00:43:18.262 --> 00:43:19.396
LIKE WE SHOULD GIVE THEM THAT

00:43:19.463 --> 00:43:21.198
SAME LEVEL OF COMFORT AS WELL

00:43:21.265 --> 00:43:22.433
BECAUSE HERE THEY ARE JUST OUT

00:43:22.499 --> 00:43:23.467
THERE IN EITHER KIND OF NOT

00:43:23.534 --> 00:43:24.768
KNOWING WHEN AND WHERE THEY ARE

00:43:24.835 --> 00:43:26.337
THEY CAN START UP. SO I THINK

00:43:26.403 --> 00:43:28.739
IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A DOUBLE

00:43:28.806 --> 00:43:29.340
EDGED SWORD I APPRECIATE YOUR

00:43:29.406 --> 00:43:31.275

00:43:32.776 --> 00:43:36.714
SENATE ROTH. THANK YOU MISTER

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:39.183
CHAIR YOU KNOW I- COME OUT OF

00:43:39.249 --> 00:43:41.885
THE MILITARY IN THE MILITARY WE

00:43:41.952 --> 00:43:42.453
HAVE LOTS OF METRICS AND WE

00:43:42.519 --> 00:43:44.722
USED TO SAY WHAT GETS MEASURED

00:43:44.788 --> 00:43:46.490
GETS DONE AND TO FOLLOW ALONG

00:43:46.557 --> 00:43:48.625
WITH THE QUESTIONS FROM MY

00:43:48.692 --> 00:43:50.494
COLLEAGUES FROM THE ASSEMBLY IT

00:43:50.561 --> 00:43:52.463
SEEMS TO ME THAT IN THE IN THE

00:43:52.529 --> 00:43:54.431
SCHOOL APPROVAL PROCESS AND IN

00:43:54.498 --> 00:43:57.234
OTHER AREAS- WE NEED SOME SORT

00:43:57.301 --> 00:44:00.471
OF- INTERNAL TIME TARGETS YOU

00:44:00.537 --> 00:44:01.805
DO ANYWAY IN ORDER TO MEASURE

00:44:01.872 --> 00:44:04.274
PERFORMANCE. AND SO I WOULD

00:44:04.341 --> 00:44:07.478
CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE YOU- TO

00:44:07.544 --> 00:44:09.480
DEVELOP SOME SORT OF INTERNAL.

00:44:09.546 --> 00:44:11.515
SCHEME OF METRICS WERE YOU SET

00:44:11.582 --> 00:44:13.350
TIME TARGETS AT VARIOUS POINTS

00:44:13.417 --> 00:44:15.552
IN PROCESS WHETHER IT'S- SCHOOL

00:44:15.619 --> 00:44:17.654
APPROVAL OR- ONE OF THE OTHER

00:44:17.721 --> 00:44:18.922
FUNCTIONS THAT THE BOARD

00:44:18.989 --> 00:44:21.458
PERFORMS. SO YOU KNOW HOW TO

00:44:21.525 --> 00:44:22.326
MEASURE THE PERFORMANCE OF YOUR

00:44:22.393 --> 00:44:24.428
OWN TEAM. AND UNLESS YOU IN

00:44:24.495 --> 00:44:26.330
WHICH I AS I UNDERSTAND IT YOU

00:44:26.397 --> 00:44:28.332
MUST NOT HAVE THOSE TARGETS

00:44:28.399 --> 00:44:30.401
EXCEPT IN THE AREA OF

00:44:30.467 --> 00:44:32.069
DISCIPLINE AND ENFORCEMENT. AND

00:44:32.136 --> 00:44:34.338
IF NOT THEN I WOULD SUGGEST

00:44:34.405 --> 00:44:36.206
THAT YOU SET THEM. AND THAT

00:44:36.273 --> 00:44:37.574
SIZE INTO THE QUESTION I HAVE

00:44:37.641 --> 00:44:39.810
ABOUT FISCAL ISSUES AND- THE

00:44:39.877 --> 00:44:40.778
BOARD AND AT LEAST IN THE

00:44:40.844 --> 00:44:42.179
BACKGROUND PAPERS THAT WE WERE

00:44:42.246 --> 00:44:43.947
PROVIDED RAISES CERTAIN.

00:44:44.014 --> 00:44:45.682
QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR CURRENT

00:44:45.749 --> 00:44:48.118
FISCAL SITUATION. AND MY

00:44:48.185 --> 00:44:49.520
QUESTION GOES TO SCHOOL

00:44:49.586 --> 00:44:51.255
APPROVAL AND WILL REQUIRE AND

00:44:51.321 --> 00:44:51.989
YOU REFERENCED A BILL

00:44:52.056 --> 00:44:55.259
REQUIRING. SCHOOLS TO PAY A FEE

00:44:55.325 --> 00:44:56.193
FOR APPROVAL RESOLVE THE

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:58.195
BOARD'S. FISCAL CONCERNS

00:44:58.262 --> 00:44:59.797
ENTIRELY OR ARE THERE OTHER

00:44:59.863 --> 00:45:03.600
ISSUES- THAT IMPACT YOUR FISCAL

00:45:03.667 --> 00:45:08.672
OUTLOOK. I AM GOING TO TURN

00:45:08.739 --> 00:45:10.874
THIS OVER TO MS YAMAGUCHI BUT I

00:45:10.941 --> 00:45:11.942
WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A MINUTE TO

00:45:12.009 --> 00:45:14.745
ADDRESS THE IDEA THAT SCHOOLS

00:45:14.812 --> 00:45:16.313
WILL NEED TO PAY A FEE. THAT

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:18.682
BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING PUT

00:45:18.749 --> 00:45:20.517
THEIR FEE STRUCTURE IN PLACE.

00:45:20.584 --> 00:45:22.052
IT'S BEEN PROBABLY FOUR YEARS

00:45:22.119 --> 00:45:24.054
AGO NOW AND ONE OF THE THINGS

00:45:24.121 --> 00:45:26.957
THAT IT HAS DONE IS. TO HELP

00:45:27.024 --> 00:45:29.226
DIRECTORS LIKE MYSELF TO

00:45:29.293 --> 00:45:31.161
RECOGNIZE WHEN WE WANT TO MAKE

00:45:31.228 --> 00:45:33.931
CURRICULAR CHANGES THAT WE NEED

00:45:33.997 --> 00:45:34.965
TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING

00:45:35.032 --> 00:45:36.567
THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS IN A

00:45:36.633 --> 00:45:38.969
PACKAGE WE SUBMIT THAT PACKAGE

00:45:39.036 --> 00:45:41.171
AND THEN THE NEC'S. CAMELBACK

00:45:41.238 --> 00:45:44.341
PAPERWORK ONE TIME INSTEAD OF

00:45:44.408 --> 00:45:46.677
PEOPLE SUBMITTING CHANGES MAYBE

00:45:46.743 --> 00:45:48.812
MULTIPLE TIMES DURING THE YEAR

00:45:48.879 --> 00:45:50.481
WHICH IS VERY TIME CONSUMING

00:45:50.547 --> 00:45:52.116
PROCESS THOSE AND IT DOESN'T

00:45:52.182 --> 00:45:55.319
BENEFIT THE SCHOOLS. OR AND

00:45:55.385 --> 00:45:57.054
THEY THEY WORK ON THE BBMP

00:45:57.121 --> 00:45:58.755
TEETH SO FOR MYSELF PERSONALLY

00:45:58.822 --> 00:46:03.694
AS A DIRECTOR I. DON'T SEE- I

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:06.563
DON'T SEE ANY NEGATIVE TWO.

00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:09.133
ENFORCING SOME FEES ON THE

00:46:09.199 --> 00:46:10.801
SCHOOLS INCLUDING MY OWN SCHOOL

00:46:10.868 --> 00:46:12.569
WHICH IS A COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

00:46:12.636 --> 00:46:14.438
SO WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO TURN

00:46:14.505 --> 00:46:16.140
THE REST OF THE QUESTION OVER

00:46:16.206 --> 00:46:21.245
TO MS YAMAGUCHI. KEEP

00:46:21.311 --> 00:46:23.547
DOCUMENTED THANK YOU SENATOR-

00:46:23.614 --> 00:46:25.082
THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS

00:46:25.149 --> 00:46:26.750
INVOLVED IN OUR OUR FISCAL

00:46:26.817 --> 00:46:28.252
HEALTH ONE OF WHICH OF COURSE

00:46:28.318 --> 00:46:29.386
IS THAT THE COST OF DOING

00:46:29.453 --> 00:46:31.889
BUSINESS INCREASED OVER THE

00:46:31.955 --> 00:46:35.092
PAST SEVERAL YEARS- AND

00:46:35.159 --> 00:46:36.093
ACTUALLY I THINK IT'S PROBABLY

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:38.061
FAIR TO SAY THAT THE COST OF

00:46:38.128 --> 00:46:41.632
DOING BUSINESS INCREASED- WELL

00:46:41.698 --> 00:46:44.501
OVER FIVE OR SIX YEARS AGO. M.

00:46:44.568 --> 00:46:46.103
BECAUSE THE BOARD HAD A VERY

00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:49.339
SUBSTANTIAL- STAFFING VACANCY

00:46:49.406 --> 00:46:50.440
RATE THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL

00:46:50.507 --> 00:46:52.476
AMOUNT OF SALARY SAVINGS WHICH

00:46:52.543 --> 00:46:54.311
ENABLED THE BOARD TO CONTINUE

00:46:54.378 --> 00:46:57.581
FUNCTIONING AND THEN WHEN IN

00:46:57.648 --> 00:46:58.315
TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHEN WE STARTED

00:46:58.382 --> 00:47:00.884
HERE- AND WHAT OUR FIRST

00:47:00.951 --> 00:47:04.354
PRIORITY OF COURSE WAS. TO MAKE-SURE THAT WE HAVE FULL STAFF

00:47:04.421 --> 00:47:06.857
AND A FULL MANAGEMENT TEAM-

00:47:06.924 --> 00:47:08.025
THOSE STATES- SALARY SAVINGS

00:47:08.091 --> 00:47:10.627
WENT AWAY- WE TRY TO BE AS

00:47:10.694 --> 00:47:12.162
FRUGAL AS WE POSSIBLY CAN OF

00:47:12.229 --> 00:47:14.865
COURSE I THINK MOST OF. OUR

00:47:14.932 --> 00:47:16.066
TEAM WILL VOUCH FOR THE FACT

00:47:16.133 --> 00:47:18.235
THAT WE ARE AS FRUGAL AS WE

00:47:18.302 --> 00:47:20.704
POSSIBLY CAN WE INVESTIGATED A

00:47:20.771 --> 00:47:23.073
NUMBER OF FACTORS VERY WASTEFUL

00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:25.309
SPENDING THAT- PREVIOUS

00:47:25.375 --> 00:47:27.878
MANAGEMENT ENGAGED IN. ALL OF

00:47:27.945 --> 00:47:28.779
THOSE HAVE BEEN CORRECTED AT

00:47:28.845 --> 00:47:33.183
THIS POINT- AND- ALL. OF THE

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:35.152
PANDEMIC. DIGITAL US TO MAKE A

00:47:35.219 --> 00:47:37.387
VERY SHORT TERM SAVINGS IN AND

00:47:37.454 --> 00:47:39.723
TRAVEL COSTS THE BUT I THINK

00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:43.393
THE KEY HERE IS THAT. THE

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:45.229
FUNDING STREAM THE REVENUE

00:47:45.295 --> 00:47:47.831
STREAM NEEDS TO BE STABILIZED

00:47:47.898 --> 00:47:50.500
IT NEEDS TO BE. BROUGHT UP TO

00:47:50.567 --> 00:47:51.201
THE POINT WHERE IT IS

00:47:51.268 --> 00:47:53.103
SUSTAINING THE BOARD'S

00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:57.374
OPERATION AND IDEALLY CREATING

00:47:57.441 --> 00:47:59.543
A PRUDENT RESERVE WE THINK-

00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:01.478
WE'RE TOLD ANYWHERE BETWEEN

00:48:01.545 --> 00:48:02.412
THREE TO SIX MONTHS OF A

00:48:02.479 --> 00:48:07.784
RESERVE. IS THE DESIRED. FIGURE

00:48:07.851 --> 00:48:08.352
WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO BEFORE

00:48:08.418 --> 00:48:12.623
THAT. THANK YOU CENTER WELL I

00:48:12.689 --> 00:48:15.259
DON'T I'M NOT BEING NEGATIVE ON

00:48:15.325 --> 00:48:16.893
CONSIDERING A SCHOOL APPROVAL

00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:18.161
FEE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:48:18.228 --> 00:48:20.364
THAT'S CLEAR ON THE RECORD. I

00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:21.732
JUST THINK THAT- THE IMPOSITION

00:48:21.798 --> 00:48:23.900
OF A OF A FEE ON THE SCHOOL

00:48:23.967 --> 00:48:25.902
IMPROVEMENT APPROVAL PROCESS IS

00:48:25.969 --> 00:48:26.703
CERTAINLY GOING TO RAISE THE

00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:28.305
BAR AND PUBLIC'S EXPECTATIONS

00:48:28.372 --> 00:48:31.375
SO IT WILL MPHASIZE EVEN MORE

00:48:31.441 --> 00:48:32.909
THE QUESTIONS THAT MY COLLEAGUE

00:48:32.976 --> 00:48:33.944
FROM THE ASSEMBLY ASKED ABOUT

00:48:34.011 --> 00:48:37.214
INTERNAL- TIME LINES AND

00:48:37.281 --> 00:48:37.748
GUIDELINES FOR PROCESSING

00:48:37.814 --> 00:48:40.550
BECAUSE I THINK- YOU WILL BE

00:48:40.617 --> 00:48:41.351
HELD TO A SLIGHTLY HIGHER

00:48:41.418 --> 00:48:43.820
STANDARD. WHEN SCHOOLS HAVE TO

00:48:43.887 --> 00:48:45.756
PAY MONEY IN ORDER TO

00:48:45.822 --> 00:48:47.124
POTENTIALLY SECURE APPROVAL

00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:48.125
FROM YOU AND TERMS OF

00:48:48.191 --> 00:48:49.793
PROCESSING LET ME MOVE ON TO

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:51.028
ANOTHER METRICS ISSUE AND

00:48:51.094 --> 00:48:53.630
THAT'S A FORMAL DISCIPLINE

00:48:53.697 --> 00:48:56.533
TIMELINES- AND OF COURSE. THE

00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:59.703
TARGET FOR FORMAL DISCIPLINE.

00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:01.738
WAS MY UNDERSTANDING IS ABOUT

00:49:01.805 --> 00:49:02.873
FIVE HUNDRED WHAT FIVE HUNDRED

00:49:02.939 --> 00:49:03.774
FORTY DAYS EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:05.842
COMPLETE THE FORMAL DISCIPLINE

00:49:05.909 --> 00:49:09.813
PROCESS- THROUGH THE ATTORNEY

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:12.349
GENERAL'S PROCESS. AND OF

00:49:12.416 --> 00:49:14.451
COURSE YOU THIS BOARD AMONG

00:49:14.518 --> 00:49:16.620
MANY MANY OTHERS- IS NOT

00:49:16.687 --> 00:49:19.756
MEETING THAT TARGET. AND JUST

00:49:19.823 --> 00:49:21.258
TO REFERENCE A LINE IN THE

00:49:21.325 --> 00:49:24.261
BACKGROUND PAPERS BECAUSE PM

00:49:24.328 --> 00:49:25.962
FOR WHICH I GUESS IS THIS

00:49:26.029 --> 00:49:26.530
DISCIPLINE METRIC THAT WE'RE

00:49:26.596 --> 00:49:28.565
TALKING ABOUT. DOES NOT TRACK

00:49:28.632 --> 00:49:30.133
CASES BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF

00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:31.802
TIME SPENT AT ANY GIVEN AGENCY

00:49:31.868 --> 00:49:34.404
IT IS DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY THE

00:49:34.471 --> 00:49:36.139
SOURCE OF POTENTIAL DELAYS

00:49:36.206 --> 00:49:37.541
SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS NEEDS TO

00:49:37.607 --> 00:49:39.343
CHANGEWE NEED TO BE ABLE TO

00:49:39.409 --> 00:49:41.878
MEASURE. THE TIME AT THE CA THE

00:49:41.945 --> 00:49:43.580
TIME IT THAT YOUR BOARD THE

00:49:43.647 --> 00:49:44.948
TIME AT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

00:49:45.015 --> 00:49:47.150
SHOP TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE

00:49:47.217 --> 00:49:48.885
BOTTLENECK IS AND WHERE THE

00:49:48.952 --> 00:49:51.922
FAILURE TO MEET THAT FIVE

00:49:51.988 --> 00:49:52.456
HUNDRED FORTY DAY. FORMAL

00:49:52.522 --> 00:49:55.125
DISCIPLINE TIMELINE IS SO WE

00:49:55.192 --> 00:49:57.527
CAN HELP YOU HELP YOURSELF AND

00:49:57.594 --> 00:49:59.996
FIX IT IS IT POSSIBLE TO BREAK

00:50:00.063 --> 00:50:01.565
THAT DOWN SO WE HAVE SOME

00:50:01.631 --> 00:50:02.899
METRICS AT THE VARIOUS POINTS

00:50:02.966 --> 00:50:04.935
IN TIME IN THIS FORMAL

00:50:05.001 --> 00:50:07.471
DISCIPLINE PROCESS. AND HOW DO

00:50:07.537 --> 00:50:11.942
WE DO THAT. YOU HAVE A GOOD SHE

00:50:12.008 --> 00:50:14.511

THANK YOU DR MOUNTAIN THANK YOU

00:50:15.946 --> 00:50:18.615
THE QUESTION SIR- THAT IS A

00:50:18.682 --> 00:50:21.184
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY. A GREAT

00:50:21.251 --> 00:50:23.520
IDEA- ACTUALLY IT'S JUSTIN THE

00:50:23.587 --> 00:50:26.089
PAST FEW MONTHS- THE DEPARTMENT

00:50:26.156 --> 00:50:28.625
HAS ACTUALLY PASSED. THE

00:50:28.692 --> 00:50:29.659
DIVISION OF INVESTIGATIONS TO

00:50:29.726 --> 00:50:33.263
WORK WITH. THE BOARDS TO.

00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:34.865
REALLY MAP OUT THE PROCESSES

00:50:34.931 --> 00:50:37.234
AND THE- WHAT IS OF THE FACTOR

00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:39.603
IN AGING AND BE ABLE TO TRACK

00:50:39.669 --> 00:50:41.772
AS YOU SAY FROM STAGE TO STAGE

00:50:41.838 --> 00:50:44.374
BECAUSE- I KNOW AND I KNOW FOR

00:50:44.441 --> 00:50:46.510
OUR BOARD AND I'M- I BELIEVE

00:50:46.576 --> 00:50:47.277
FOR PROBABLY MOST OF THE OTHER

00:50:47.344 --> 00:50:50.046
BOARDS. THAT THINGS COME INTO

00:50:50.113 --> 00:50:53.383
OUR OUR- ENFORCEMENT UNIT AND

00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:57.120
THEY LEAVE FOR THE ATTORNEY

00:50:57.187 --> 00:50:58.955
GENERAL'S OFFICE OR DO YOU BY.

00:50:59.022 --> 00:51:01.158
VERY TIMELY- CERTAINLY WITHIN A

00:51:01.224 --> 00:51:03.393
PARAMETER. BUT BUT CERTAIN

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:04.861
CERTAIN THINGS KIND OF CREATE

00:51:04.928 --> 00:51:07.297
LAGS- OVER THE PAST YEAR I

00:51:07.364 --> 00:51:09.466
THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT-

00:51:09.533 --> 00:51:11.535
JUST AS LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:51:11.601 --> 00:51:14.604
AND THE LOCAL COURTS. HAVE SORT

00:51:14.671 --> 00:51:17.040
OF SHUT DOWN OR AT LEAST SLOWED

00:51:17.107 --> 00:51:19.843
THEIR OPERATIONS THE- THE

00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:22.212
CRITICAL FACTOR OF. OBTAINING

00:51:22.279 --> 00:51:24.514
THE PROPER DOCUMENTS HAS BEEN

00:51:24.581 --> 00:51:26.249
DRAMATICALLY SLOW SO

00:51:26.316 --> 00:51:29.953
UNFORTUNATELY. PARDON ME.

00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:31.922
PARDON ME- UNFORTUNATELY I

00:51:31.988 --> 00:51:33.623
THINK IT'S BECAUSE OF THE WAY

00:51:33.690 --> 00:51:35.926
THIS UP CYCLE RUNS WERE

00:51:35.992 --> 00:51:37.194
PROBABLY LOOKING THAT THIS

00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:39.930
LASTING FOR A BIT BEFORE WE CAN

00:51:39.996 --> 00:51:41.765
ACTUALLY REALLY START SEEING

00:51:41.832 --> 00:51:43.767
THAT TEND REVERSED BUT AS I

00:51:43.834 --> 00:51:45.335
SAID- THE DEPARTMENT DIVISION

WE HAVE A LOT OF HOPE THAT

00:51:51.141 --> 00:51:53.977
WE'LL BE ABLE TO CERTAINLY-

00:51:54.044 --> 00:51:56.346
BREAKOUT PROCESS AND FIGURE OUT

00:51:56.413 --> 00:51:57.280
WHERE THOSE BOTTLENECKS REALLY

00:51:57.347 --> 00:51:59.883
ARE IN ONE OF THE CONTRIBUTING

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:02.118
CAUSES THERE THANK YOU. WELL

VARIOUS STAGES IN THE FORMAL

00:52:19.336 --> 00:52:21.271
DISCIPLINE PROCESS AND IF YOU

00:52:21.338 --> 00:52:22.472

IN IT CREATED A VERY SUDDEN AND

00:55:04.334 --> 00:55:08.271
VERY. SHARP CORPORATE CRISIS-

00:55:08.338 --> 00:55:10.106
FOR THE SCHOOLS TO DEAL WITH

00:55:10.173 --> 00:55:11.808
AND YOU KNOW AS A AS A SIDE

00:55:11.875 --> 00:55:16.479
NOTE. THE MANY SEIZE DO THIS IS

00:55:16.546 --> 00:55:18.081
THIS IS EXACTLY WHY THE NEC

00:55:18.148 --> 00:55:20.250
SPEND SO VERY MUCH TIME WORKING

00:55:20.316 --> 00:55:21.551
WITH THE PROGRAMS TO ENSURE

00:55:21.618 --> 00:55:23.586
THAT THEY D HAVE ADEQUATE

00:55:23.653 --> 00:55:25.655
RESOURCES GOING FORWARD AND

00:55:25.722 --> 00:55:26.823
THEY LOOK VERY CAREFULLY

00:55:26.890 --> 00:55:29.059
BECAUSE IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO SIT

00:55:29.125 --> 00:55:30.627
FOR A SCHOOL TO SAY WELL WE

00:55:30.694 --> 00:55:32.529
HAVE THESE PLACEMENTS- THEY

00:55:32.595 --> 00:55:33.797
HAVE TO LOOK AT SEE WHERE THOSE

00:55:33.863 --> 00:55:36.232
PLACEMENTS ARE AND THE STATE

00:55:36.299 --> 00:55:37.701
WELL THE OTHER PROGRAM IN

00:55:37.767 --> 00:55:39.202
RIVERSIDE LIST EXACT SAME

00:55:39.269 --> 00:55:42.038
THINGS. IS THERE A PROBLEM HERE

00:55:42.105 --> 00:55:44.140
SO IF YOU LIKE THIS IS A VERY

00:55:44.207 --> 00:55:46.543
INTRICATE PROCESS BUT- TO MOVE

00:55:46.609 --> 00:55:48.878
FORWARD I THINK- DR MOUNTAIN IS

00:55:48.945 --> 00:55:50.814
100% CORRECT HERE THAT WE DO

00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:52.816
HAVE TO LOOK AT A VARIETY OF

00:55:52.882 --> 00:55:57.654
NEW WAYS TO PRODUCE- EXPERIENCE

00:55:57.721 --> 00:55:59.856
FOR NURSING STUDENTS- BUT ALL

00:55:59.923 --> 00:56:01.858
THE WHILE I THINK IT'S-

00:56:01.925 --> 00:56:03.059
IMPORTANT I THINK OUR BOARD HAS

00:56:03.126 --> 00:56:05.028
BEEN. VERY VERY STRONG IN THE

00:56:05.095 --> 00:56:07.831
FACT THAT. SIMULATION

00:56:07.897 --> 00:56:10.333
TELEHEALTH. AND OTHER OTHER

00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:13.069
ROUGH EXPERIENCES ARE NOT A

00:56:13.136 --> 00:56:15.872
SUBSTITUTE AND MAY NOT TAKE THE

00:56:15.939 --> 00:56:18.308
PLACE OF A HUNDRED PERCENT. OF

00:56:18.374 --> 00:56:19.642
THE CLINICAL DATA OUT

00:56:19.709 --> 00:56:21.077
EXPERIENCE FOR THE STUDENTS

00:56:21.144 --> 00:56:23.546
STUDENTS MUST WORK WITH LIFE

00:56:23.613 --> 00:56:26.015
PATIENCE TO BE QUALIFIED

00:56:26.082 --> 00:56:28.618
NURSES- THAT'S NOT. IN POLICY

00:56:28.685 --> 00:56:30.920
THAT'S NOT A LONGER RACE BUT

00:56:30.987 --> 00:56:32.922
IT'S ESSENTIAL AND I AND I

00:56:32.989 --> 00:56:35.458
COULD FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT

00:56:35.525 --> 00:56:36.726
NINE OR BOARD DOES AS WELL.

00:56:36.793 --> 00:56:38.528
WELL I'VE- LET ME JUST SAY THIS

00:56:38.595 --> 00:56:41.297
I THINK- THE PROBLEM IS WE NEED

00:56:41.364 --> 00:56:43.166
MORE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS.

00:56:43.233 --> 00:56:46.236
CERTAINLY WE NEED MORE NURSES

00:56:46.302 --> 00:56:48.738
AND THERE'S A FINITE NUMBER OF

00:56:48.805 --> 00:56:52.842
TRAINING SITES AVAILABLE. SO

00:56:52.909 --> 00:56:54.611
AND OF COURSE THERE UNDERSERVED

00:56:54.677 --> 00:56:56.312
AREAS OF THE STATE TODAY THE

00:56:56.379 --> 00:56:57.480
POPULATION OF THE STATE'S

00:56:57.547 --> 00:56:59.482
GROWING THAT'S NOT GOING TO

00:56:59.549 --> 00:57:01.451
MAKE THE UNDERSERVED AREAS FOR

00:57:01.518 --> 00:57:03.286
PURPOSES OF HEALTH CARE ANY

00:57:03.353 --> 00:57:06.356
BETTER OFF SO EITHER WE NEED

00:57:06.422 --> 00:57:07.290
WE'RE GOING TO REDUCE THE

00:57:07.357 --> 00:57:09.292
NUMBER OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS

00:57:09.359 --> 00:57:10.727
IN TRAINING THAT ARE COMING OUT

00:57:10.794 --> 00:57:11.795
OF THE PIPELINE OR KEEP IT THE

00:57:11.861 --> 00:57:13.663
SAME OR WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO

00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:16.733
FIGURE OUT FAIRLY QUICKLY. HOW

00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:17.967
WE PROVIDE THE ESSENTIAL

00:57:18.034 --> 00:57:20.537
TRAINING TO THE INCREASED

00:57:20.603 --> 00:57:22.238
NUMBER OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS.

00:57:22.305 --> 00:57:24.808
WE NEED TO PRODUCE GIVEN THE

00:57:24.874 --> 00:57:26.776
FACT THAT IT IS UNLIKELY WE'VE

00:57:26.843 --> 00:57:28.711
DRAMATICALLY EXPANDED. THE

00:57:28.778 --> 00:57:31.181
NUMBER OF PHYSICAL TRAINING

00:57:31.247 --> 00:57:32.415
SITES THAT WE HAVE AROUND THE

00:57:32.482 --> 00:57:34.684
STATE TO HANDLE THE DEMAND SO

00:57:34.751 --> 00:57:36.452
IT SEEMS TO ME AND I WOULD LIKE

00:57:36.519 --> 00:57:37.754
TO HEAR FROM YOU NOT TODAY

00:57:37.821 --> 00:57:40.790
OBVIOUSLY BUT- AT SOME POINT AS

00:57:40.857 --> 00:57:42.792
WE MOVE THROUGH THIS PROCESS.

00:57:42.859 --> 00:57:44.828
OF WHAT THE PLAN IS WHAT THE

00:57:44.894 --> 00:57:46.696
SCHEDULE IS I NOTICED FROM THE

00:57:46.763 --> 00:57:48.531
MATERIAL THAT YOU CONDUCTED A-

00:57:48.598 --> 00:57:49.699
AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON

00:57:49.766 --> 00:57:51.234
SIMULATION AS I RECALL IF I

00:57:51.301 --> 00:57:53.837
READ IT CORRECTLY. AND WHAT THE

00:57:53.903 --> 00:57:56.639
PRODUCT OF THAT IS- I REALIZE

00:57:56.706 --> 00:57:57.407
YOU KNOW THE WAY WE'VE DONE

00:57:57.473 --> 00:57:59.275
BUSINESS TO WAY WE DO IT TODAY

00:57:59.342 --> 00:58:00.677
WE- WAY WE'VE DONE BUSINESS IN

00:58:00.743 --> 00:58:02.846
THE PAST IS NOT TO RELY. AS

00:58:02.912 --> 00:58:04.414
MUCH ON SIMULATION AND SOME OF

00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:06.816
THESE OTHER. TECHNIQUES BUT-

00:58:06.883 --> 00:58:08.885
TELEHEALTH FOR EXAMPLE BUT IT

00:58:08.952 --> 00:58:11.387
SEEMS TO ME THAT WE'RE GOING TO

00:58:11.454 --> 00:58:12.388
HAVE TO RE EXPLORE THAT IF WE-

00:58:12.455 --> 00:58:14.591
ARE INTERESTED IN CRACKING THIS

00:58:14.657 --> 00:58:16.926
NOT. AND THE NOT BEING HOW TO

00:58:16.993 --> 00:58:19.329
PROVIDE HEALTH CARE SERVICES.

00:58:19.395 --> 00:58:20.396

00:59:08.444 --> 00:59:09.646
PART OF THOSE SCHOOL PROGRAM

00:59:09.712 --> 00:59:12.482
APPROVAL PROCESS. REQUIRES A

SPEED UP THE APPROVAL PROCESS

00:59:29.866 --> 00:59:31.467
IF WE ALLOW A THIRD PARTY

00:59:31.534 --> 00:59:36.806

ALWAYS BEEN A PLEASURE TO TALK

TO YOU AND YOUR STAFF- THIS IS

00:59:50.253 --> 00:59:51.988
A GREAT QUESTION FOR SO MANY

00:59:52.055 --> 00:59:54.223
REASONS- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

00:59:54.290 --> 00:59:55.291
WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT WHEN I

00:59:55.358 --> 00:59:58.695
BURIED. MY VERY FIRST- MONTHS

00:59:58.761 --> 01:00:01.831
HERE OF THE BOARD- NEC'S ARE

01:00:01.898 --> 01:00:04.934
TREMENDOUSLY SKILLED EDUCATED

01:00:05.001 --> 01:00:07.870
TRAINED- MOST OF THEM HAVE

01:00:07.937 --> 01:00:10.440
ADVANCED DEGREES OF A FEW OF

01:00:10.506 --> 01:00:13.142
OUR STAFF HAVE DOCTORS IN FACT-

01:00:13.209 --> 01:00:15.211
IN YES THE RESOURCES ARE ARE

01:00:15.278 --> 01:00:16.879
ARE PRETTY FINITE SO ONE OF

01:00:16.946 --> 01:00:18.715
THINGS WE HAD BEEN LOOKING INTO

01:00:18.781 --> 01:00:21.718
DISCUSSING IT INTERNALLY IS.

01:00:21.784 --> 01:00:23.286
ARE THERE WAYS THAT WE CAN

01:00:23.353 --> 01:00:24.387
STRETCH THAT RESOURCE ARE THERE

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:26.389
ARE WAYS THAT WE COULD EMPLOY

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:29.425
FOR EXAMPLE- ANALYSTS TO WORK

01:00:29.492 --> 01:00:32.962
WITH THE NEC'S TO ENABLE THEM

01:00:33.029 --> 01:00:34.430
TO COVER MORE GROUND. AND WE'VE-

01:00:34.497 --> 01:00:36.699
FOUND MOSTLY THAT AND ANALYST

01:00:36.766 --> 01:00:38.468
WOULD REQUIRE A VAST AMOUNT OF

01:00:38.534 --> 01:00:43.506
TRAINING- TO BE ABLE TO. REALLY

01:00:43.573 --> 01:00:45.541
HAVE THAT INSIGHT THAT ABILITY

01:00:45.608 --> 01:00:48.611
TO FIND FLAWS ARE FINE-

01:00:48.678 --> 01:00:51.514
POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS IN IN FOR

01:00:51.581 --> 01:00:53.416
EXAMPLE A SCHOOLS FACILITIES OR

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:55.051
CURRICULUM IT REALLY DOES

01:00:55.118 --> 01:00:56.819
REQUIRE SOMEBODY WITH A GOOD

01:00:56.886 --> 01:00:58.788
AMOUNT OF EXPERTISE. ONE THING

01:00:58.855 --> 01:01:01.224
WE TALKED ABOUT- IN IN THIS

01:01:01.290 --> 01:01:03.526
WOULD REQUIRE SOME SOME WITH

01:01:03.593 --> 01:01:04.427
WITH CALLIE JAR IN THE STATE

01:01:04.494 --> 01:01:06.329
PERSONNEL BOARD ONE THINGS WE

01:01:06.396 --> 01:01:08.731
TALKED ABOUT WAS BEING ABLE TO.

01:01:08.798 --> 01:01:11.701
HIRE AN IMPACT EMPOWER. ACTIVE

01:01:11.768 --> 01:01:13.636
LICENSEES- VOCATIONAL NURSING

01:01:13.703 --> 01:01:15.872
AND PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS TO

01:01:15.938 --> 01:01:17.573
HELP PROVIDE THAT KIND OF A

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:19.542
RESOURCE THAT ON THE GROUND

01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:21.911
RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS THAT FACT

01:01:21.978 --> 01:01:24.047
FINDING BECAUSE- AS AS

01:01:24.113 --> 01:01:25.548
LICENSEES THEY BEEN THROUGH THE

01:01:25.615 --> 01:01:27.283
PROGRAMS THEY WOULD KNOW WHAT

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:28.818
TO LOOK FOR. THEY WOULD

01:01:28.885 --> 01:01:30.119
UNDERSTAND CERTAINLY FROM THEIR

01:01:30.186 --> 01:01:32.688
OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WHAT

01:01:32.755 --> 01:01:35.558
WORKED AND WHAT WOULDN'T WORK-

01:01:35.625 --> 01:01:36.259
THESE ARE WHAT THE SOME OF THE

01:01:36.325 --> 01:01:37.894
THINGS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT I

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:40.296
THINK- BUT I DO WANT TO I DO

01:01:40.363 --> 01:01:42.498
WANT TO SEE VERY. VERY FIRMLY

01:01:42.565 --> 01:01:45.568
THOUGH THAT ARE NEC'S ARE

01:01:45.635 --> 01:01:47.003
AMAZING AND WE'VE BEEN VERY

01:01:47.070 --> 01:01:50.473
VERY FORTUNATE IN OUR TEAM- AT

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:52.575
THIS POINT TIME WE DO HAVE SIX

01:01:52.642 --> 01:01:55.044
AS I MENTIONED BEFORE- WE'VE

01:01:55.111 --> 01:01:57.647
LOST ONE LAST YEAR- SHE

01:01:57.713 --> 01:02:02.985
RETIRED- BUT OUR TEAM IS VERY

01:02:03.052 --> 01:02:04.020
UNIFIED IN VERY VERY.

01:02:04.087 --> 01:02:06.422
EXPERIENCE AND INTERESTINGLY

01:02:06.489 --> 01:02:07.657
THEIR EXPERIENCE IN A VERY

01:02:07.723 --> 01:02:09.692
DIVERSE AREA SO WE HAVE PEOPLE

01:02:09.759 --> 01:02:11.661
WHOSE EXPERTISE IS CURRICULUM

01:02:11.727 --> 01:02:14.297
PEOPLE WHO. DID MORE FACULTY

01:02:14.363 --> 01:02:16.699
MORE FACILITIES SO WE'VE BEEN

01:02:16.766 --> 01:02:18.534
ABLE TO I THINK STRUCTURE THAT.

01:02:18.601 --> 01:02:21.838
BY HAVING KIND OF A- BUT A LEAD

01:02:21.904 --> 01:02:24.073
IF YOU WILL. ON THAT FIRMANDO

01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:25.508
MR TRUMP I APOLOGIZE BECAUSE

01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:27.577
I'M NOT CERTAIN I'M GETTING ALL

01:02:27.643 --> 01:02:31.180
THE FACETS OF YOUR QUESTION. NO

01:02:31.247 --> 01:02:32.682
I THINK YOU'RE A ANSWERING TO

01:02:32.748 --> 01:02:34.450
THE QUESTION APPROPRIATELY AND

01:02:34.517 --> 01:02:37.286
IF I MAY- I DO WANT TO TALK

01:02:37.353 --> 01:02:38.921
ABOUT ANOTHER SUBJECT IF THAT'S

01:02:38.988 --> 01:02:41.157
RAIMES ALLERGY AND- MILLER

THE STATE IN TERMS OF A HOPE

01:02:47.864 --> 01:02:50.066
AND A NEED TO EXPEDITE. THE

01:02:50.133 --> 01:02:51.000
APPROVAL NURSING PROGRAM

01:02:51.067 --> 01:02:53.369
PROCESS AND- THIS TEAM CHAIRMAN

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:54.637
ROB WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW

01:02:54.704 --> 01:02:56.873
INDIAN DURING THIS PANDEMIC WE

01:02:56.939 --> 01:02:57.740
HOPE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A

01:02:57.807 --> 01:03:00.243
PIPELINE. OF PRACTITIONERS TO

01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:01.077
BE ABLE TO GET IN THE FRONT

01:03:01.144 --> 01:03:03.613
LINES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND

01:03:03.679 --> 01:03:05.014
WE'VE HEARD ALL THROUGHOUT THE

01:03:05.081 --> 01:03:06.349
STATE. THAT THERE COULD BE

01:03:06.415 --> 01:03:08.050
ANYWHERE BETWEEN WAYS OF TO WIN

01:03:08.117 --> 01:03:09.852
THREE YEARS- AND THERE'S A

01:03:09.919 --> 01:03:12.889
POSSIBILITY OF PERHAPS- TAKING

01:03:12.955 --> 01:03:14.457
AWAY SOME THE REDUNDANCIES WHAT

01:03:14.524 --> 01:03:15.658
ELIMINATE SOME OF THE

01:03:15.725 --> 01:03:17.560
REDUNDANCIES- ON THE BOARD

01:03:17.627 --> 01:03:19.061
LEVEL TO SPEED UP THE APPROVAL

01:03:19.128 --> 01:03:21.030
PROCESS TO ADDRESS. AS I

01:03:21.097 --> 01:03:23.299
UNDERSTAND THE CURRENT BACKLOG-

01:03:23.366 --> 01:03:25.268
IS THERE A PROCESS RIGHT NOW TO

01:03:25.334 --> 01:03:28.204
REDUCE OR ELIMINATE

01:03:28.271 --> 01:03:33.643
REDUNDANCIES. I ASSUME YOU WANT

01:03:33.709 --> 01:03:40.016
ME TO ANSWER THE STOCK AMOUNT.

01:03:40.082 --> 01:03:41.651
MISTER CHENEY EXACTLY RIGHT

01:03:41.717 --> 01:03:43.719
ONE- WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT

01:03:43.786 --> 01:03:46.189
SEVERAL JOURNALISM. FOR ONE

01:03:46.255 --> 01:03:48.324
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT- IS IT

01:03:48.391 --> 01:03:50.826
POSSIBLE TO SPLIT THE LIST AND-

01:03:50.893 --> 01:03:52.728
HAVE A LIST FOR PRIVATE SCHOOLS

01:03:52.795 --> 01:03:53.663
AND THEN A SEPARATE LIST FOR

01:03:53.729 --> 01:03:56.632
PUBLIC SCHOOLS. AND ALLOW US TO

01:03:56.699 --> 01:03:59.435
ADDRESS THEM- SORT OF IN

01:03:59.502 --> 01:04:03.940
TANDEM. WHICH- BECAUSE- PRIVATE

01:04:04.006 --> 01:04:05.274
SCHOOLS AND PRIVATE SCHOOL

01:04:05.341 --> 01:04:08.077
PROPOSALS. VASTLY OUTNUMBERED

01:04:08.144 --> 01:04:10.313
THE PUBLIC PROPOSALS AND THIS

01:04:10.379 --> 01:04:11.814
WOULD ACCELERATE THE APPROVAL

01:04:11.881 --> 01:04:15.051
OF THE PUBLIC PROGRAMS- ONE OF

01:04:15.117 --> 01:04:15.651
THE THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT OF

01:04:15.718 --> 01:04:18.788
COURSE WAS A- LOOKING INTO WAY

01:04:18.854 --> 01:04:19.422
TO STAGE OUT THE APPROVAL

01:04:19.488 --> 01:04:21.691
PROCESS. AND DO A LITTLE BIT

01:04:21.757 --> 01:04:24.227
MORE INITIAL TRIAGE- WHEN THE

01:04:24.293 --> 01:04:25.561
INITIAL PROPOSAL THE INITIAL

01:04:25.628 --> 01:04:27.096
LETTER OF INTENT YEARS

01:04:27.163 --> 01:04:29.465
RECEIVED- WE THINK THAT THAT

01:04:29.532 --> 01:04:31.567
WOULD. THAT WOULD HELP I THINK

01:04:31.634 --> 01:04:34.971
KIND OF. A FOCUS AND SO. AT

01:04:35.037 --> 01:04:36.839
THAT POINT WE WOULD HAVE I

01:04:36.906 --> 01:04:40.509
THINK OF MORE. TRIAGE

01:04:40.576 --> 01:04:43.112
PRIORITIZE APPROVAL PROCESS- WE

01:04:43.179 --> 01:04:45.715
WOULD REQUIRE RAKES FOR THIS- I

01:04:45.781 --> 01:04:47.250
THINK THAT I THINK IT'S FAIR TO

01:04:47.316 --> 01:04:50.086
SAY THAT- THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

01:04:50.152 --> 01:04:51.988
STEPS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO.

01:04:52.054 --> 01:04:55.291
EXPLORE AND MOST WOULD REQUIRE

01:04:55.358 --> 01:04:57.026
SOME SEVERAL MAKING ACTIVITY

01:04:57.093 --> 01:04:58.327
WELL THE IDEAS THAT WE HAD

01:04:58.394 --> 01:05:00.062
TALKED ABOUT I THINK A BIT.

01:05:00.129 --> 01:05:06.636
WAS- THE VERY IDEA OF. ALLOWING

01:05:06.702 --> 01:05:08.537
PROGRAM SCHOOLS THAT HAVE

01:05:08.604 --> 01:05:11.674
MULTIPLE CAMPUSES- IF THEY'RE

01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:13.175
USING EXACTLY THE SAME

01:05:13.242 --> 01:05:14.076
CURRICULUM EXACTLY SAME

01:05:14.143 --> 01:05:16.112
POLICIES. SHOULD THEY JUST HAVE

01:05:16.178 --> 01:05:17.780
AN ACCELERATED APPROVAL

01:05:17.847 --> 01:05:20.349
PROCESS. WHICH IS- A VERY

01:05:20.416 --> 01:05:23.653
INTERESTING IDEA. EDIT IT WOULD

01:05:23.719 --> 01:05:25.621
SUIT THE GOAL OF HAVING MORE

01:05:25.688 --> 01:05:27.857
PROGRAMS OPEN AND MORE STUDENT

01:05:27.923 --> 01:05:30.226
SEATS AVAILABLE QUICKLY. BUT

01:05:30.293 --> 01:05:31.727
WHAT IT WOULD DO OF COURSE THAT

01:05:31.794 --> 01:05:34.530
IS ALSO CREATE MORE OF- BUT

01:05:34.597 --> 01:05:36.499
AWFULLY SYSTEM WHERE. THE

01:05:36.565 --> 01:05:38.234
LARGER BETTER FUNDED PROGRAMS

01:05:38.301 --> 01:05:40.870
DO. START TO ACQUIRE MORE OF A

01:05:40.936 --> 01:05:44.573
PRESENCE AND- NOT NECESSARILY A

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:45.574
BAD THING I WILL TELL YOU THAT.

01:05:45.641 --> 01:05:47.576
BUT AT THE SAME TIME BECAUSE WE

01:05:47.643 --> 01:05:50.479
DO WANT- PROGRAMS FROM

01:05:50.546 --> 01:05:52.014
UNDERSERVED AREAS SMALLER

01:05:52.081 --> 01:05:54.016
PROGRAMS- PROGRAMS THAT ARE

01:05:54.083 --> 01:05:56.018
AFFILIATED WITH LIKE FOR

01:05:56.085 --> 01:05:56.552
EXAMPLE COUNTY OFFICES OF

01:05:56.619 --> 01:05:59.021
EDUCATION. IT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:05:59.088 --> 01:06:00.589
NEEDS TO BE EXPLORED CAREFULLY-

01:06:00.656 --> 01:06:03.025
IN PERHAPS BUT AS YOU KNOW IT

01:06:03.092 --> 01:06:04.694
IT'S A VERY LONG PROCESS TO

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:07.263
MAKE A DECISION LET ALONE TO

01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:09.565
LAUNCH A NEW WAY OF DOING

01:06:09.632 --> 01:06:12.234
BUSINESS- BUT IT THESE ARE A

01:06:12.301 --> 01:06:12.835
NUMBER OF THINGS WE'VE

01:06:12.902 --> 01:06:15.571
DISCUSSED DOING- AS I SAY. SOME

01:06:15.638 --> 01:06:18.541
OF THEM YOUR BOARD CAN ACT ON

01:06:18.607 --> 01:06:21.577
ON SOME SOME NOTIONS THAT CAN

01:06:21.644 --> 01:06:23.813
HELP US TO BETTER PROCESS THAT

01:06:23.879 --> 01:06:24.980
WAITING LIST AND THAT

01:06:25.047 --> 01:06:27.650
APPLICATION TIME. HELLO I'M-

01:06:27.717 --> 01:06:31.287
YOU SPOKE TO NO REDUNDANCIES IT.

01:06:31.354 --> 01:06:33.923
YOU KNOW EXCESSIVE PROCESSES I

01:06:33.989 --> 01:06:36.292
THINK- AND THAT IS FAIR I THINK

01:06:36.359 --> 01:06:38.661
BECAUSE- AS I SAID I THINK

01:06:38.728 --> 01:06:41.831
EARLIER. OF THE ONE OF THE-

01:06:41.897 --> 01:06:46.035
MOST TIME CONSUMING. PARTS OF

01:06:46.102 --> 01:06:49.438
THE PROCESS IS THE REVIEW AND

01:06:49.505 --> 01:06:52.274
APPROVAL OF CURRICULUM. OF ONE

01:06:52.341 --> 01:06:53.209
OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE TALKED

01:06:53.275 --> 01:06:55.711
ABOUT WHICH PEOPLE EITHER LOVE

01:06:55.778 --> 01:06:58.280
OR HATE. IS SHOULD THE STATE OF

01:06:58.347 --> 01:07:00.082
CALIFORNIA HAVE A UNIFORM

01:07:00.149 --> 01:07:04.453
CURRICULUM. AND THAT CHANGES

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:07.223
EVERYTHING- THAT'S SOMETHING WE

01:07:07.289 --> 01:07:09.825
SHOULD CONSIDER AND I KNOW THAT

01:07:09.892 --> 01:07:10.393
OUR BOARD WILL CERTAINLY BE

01:07:10.459 --> 01:07:12.962
DISCUSSING. DR MOUNTED YOU WANT

01:07:13.028 --> 01:07:18.734
TO ADD ANYTHING TO THAT. AND I

01:07:18.801 --> 01:07:20.936
AM ABSOLUTELY 100% IN SUPPORT

01:07:21.003 --> 01:07:22.872
OF THAT UNIFIED CURRICULUM

01:07:22.938 --> 01:07:24.407
ACROSS THE STATE AND I THINK

01:07:24.473 --> 01:07:26.876
THAT IT WOULD CERTAINLY ADDRESS

01:07:26.942 --> 01:07:28.377
SEVERAL ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN

01:07:28.444 --> 01:07:30.146
BROUGHT UP TO DATE AND IF

01:07:30.212 --> 01:07:32.314
THERE'S UNIFIED CURRICULUM THEN

01:07:32.381 --> 01:07:35.418
THE CLINICAL USAGE WILL BE.

01:07:35.484 --> 01:07:39.021
MORE EQUITABLE ACROSS THE BOARD

01:07:39.088 --> 01:07:40.890
AND PROGRAMS COULD WORK MORE

01:07:40.956 --> 01:07:42.458
COOPERATIVELY AND SO THAT'S

01:07:42.525 --> 01:07:44.693
DEFINITELY SOMETHING. THAT I AS

01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:46.729
A BOARD PRESIDENT OF SUPPORT

01:07:46.796 --> 01:07:48.197
AND I BELIEVE THAT THE REST OF

01:07:48.264 --> 01:07:50.599
THE BOARD IS ABSOLUTELY OPEN TO

01:07:50.666 --> 01:07:54.069
CONSIDERING. A GERMAN LOS

01:07:54.136 --> 01:07:55.671
AMASSED ONE FINAL QUESTION

POINT. AND AT THE GET A AT

01:09:16.652 --> 01:09:20.022
LEAST AN IDEA OF WHERE IT IS AS

01:09:20.089 --> 01:09:24.193
OPPOSED. TO PERHAPS JUST.

01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:25.394
PUTTING IT IN A PROCESS WHERE

01:10:43.672 --> 01:10:45.441
SIGN YOUR PROGRAM DO YOU WANT

01:10:45.507 --> 01:10:48.210
TO STAY ON THE LIST- IN SOME

01:10:48.277 --> 01:10:50.746
CASES WHEN WE- NOT BEEN ABLE TO

01:10:50.813 --> 01:10:53.549

PATRICIAN PRUNING OF THE LIST

01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:00.122
THERE WHICH DEBT BUT IT DOESN'T

01:11:00.189 --> 01:11:03.859
HAPPEN VERY OFTEN- I THINK IT'S

01:11:03.926 --> 01:11:07.529
FAIR TO SAY THAT. WHAT WE DO

01:11:07.596 --> 01:11:09.632
PROVIDE IS WHAT WE CAN PROVIDE

01:11:09.698 --> 01:11:11.567
AT THIS POINT BECAUSE AS I

01:11:11.634 --> 01:11:14.203
SAID. IN TILL IT REACHES A

01:11:14.269 --> 01:11:15.938
CERTAIN OINT ON THE LIST AND

01:11:16.005 --> 01:11:18.007

YOU GET TO BE SOMEWHERE ABOUT.

01:11:20.476 --> 01:11:23.212
BETWEEN I THINK TEN AND TWENTY-

01:11:23.278 --> 01:11:24.913
YOU'RE WAITING. AND THERE'S NOT

01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:26.815
MUCH YOU CAN DO ALTHOUGH WE DO

01:11:26.882 --> 01:11:27.916
STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU

01:11:27.983 --> 01:11:29.918
PEOPLE WORKING UNDER YOUR

01:11:29.985 --> 01:11:30.719
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN YOUR

01:11:30.786 --> 01:11:34.056
CURRICULUM. BUT THERE'S NOT A

01:11:34.123 --> 01:11:37.226
WAY TO SAY. YOUR SIX MONTHS OUT

01:11:37.292 --> 01:11:38.227
YOUR TEN MONTHS OUT YOUR TWO

01:11:38.293 --> 01:11:40.095
YEARS OUT. WITH ANY DEGREE OF

01:11:40.162 --> 01:11:42.398
ACCURACY BECAUSE THE PROCESS

01:11:42.464 --> 01:11:45.234
ITSELF IS SORT OF VERY.

01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:46.635
INCONSISTENT DOESN'T REALLY

01:11:46.702 --> 01:11:49.238
WORK I WANT BUT- IT VERY SO

01:11:49.304 --> 01:11:51.006
STRONGLY FROM FROM PROGRAM TO

01:11:51.073 --> 01:11:54.543
PROGRAM. AND UNFORTUNATELY. I'M

01:11:54.610 --> 01:11:57.746
A BIG PART OF THAT VARIANCE HAS

01:11:57.813 --> 01:11:59.648
TO DO WITH THE PEOPLE INVOLVED

01:11:59.715 --> 01:12:02.184
WHEN THEY DON'T REPLY IN A

01:12:02.251 --> 01:12:04.186
TIMELY MANNER OR THEY SUBMIT-

01:12:04.253 --> 01:12:06.822

01:12:11.527 --> 01:12:14.196
SAYING THANK YOU THAT'S GREAT

01:12:14.263 --> 01:12:16.398
BUT YOU'RE MISSING PARTS THREE

01:12:16.465 --> 01:12:17.166
FOUR FIVE AND THEN THEY SEND

01:12:17.232 --> 01:12:20.002
THAT BACK IN THE PROPOSING BODY

01:12:20.069 --> 01:12:21.503
CHáVEZ PART THREE BUT NOT

01:12:21.570 --> 01:12:23.372
FOREIGN FIVE AND THERE'S A BACK

01:12:23.439 --> 01:12:24.907
AND FORTH AND BACK AND FORTH

01:12:24.973 --> 01:12:26.542
AND THAT DOES ABSORB A VAST

01:12:26.608 --> 01:12:30.012
AMOUNT OF TIME- ONE OF THE

01:12:30.079 --> 01:12:30.612
THINGS I THINK WE TALKED ABOUT

01:12:30.679 --> 01:12:31.647
WITH THEM. THE ASSEMBLY

01:12:31.714 --> 01:12:35.751
COMMITTEE STAFF IS. WE PROBABLY

01:12:35.818 --> 01:12:36.318
SHOULD CREATE TIGHTER

01:12:36.385 --> 01:12:39.621
TIMELINES- REQUIREMENTS THAT IF

01:12:39.688 --> 01:12:42.091

ACTIVE WE WOULD NEED A DESIGN-

01:12:53.602 --> 01:12:55.804
STRUCTURE LIKE THAT. AGAIN THIS

01:12:55.871 --> 01:12:57.439
WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY REQUIRE

01:12:57.506 --> 01:12:59.942
WILL MAKING- BUT THERE'S A

01:13:00.008 --> 01:13:00.609
THERE'S A NUMBER OF

01:13:00.676 --> 01:13:02.845
ALTERNATIVES AND- AND I AND I

01:13:02.911 --> 01:13:04.213
UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT YOU IN

THE OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE

01:13:04.913 --> 01:13:07.249
SAYING THAT. CERTAINLY IT WOULD

01:13:07.316 --> 01:13:10.385
BE FAIR AND IT WOULD BE

01:13:10.452 --> 01:13:14.089
APPROPRIATE FOR US TO. OF I

01:13:14.156 --> 01:13:14.790
THINK IMPROVE OUR

01:13:14.857 --> 01:13:17.826

01:13:35.944 --> 01:13:39.214
COLLEAGUE FROM RIP AND- SAID

01:13:39.281 --> 01:13:41.049

ACCREDITED- FOR EDUCATIONAL

01:13:44.086 --> 01:13:45.988
QUALITY AND WHICH IS EXTENSIVE

01:13:46.054 --> 01:13:46.522
APPROVAL PROCESS AND THEN

01:13:46.588 --> 01:13:48.257
SEPARATELY. THAT THERE'S

01:13:48.323 --> 01:13:49.525
ANOTHER APPROVAL PROCESS THAT

01:13:49.591 --> 01:13:51.360
THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH. WITH

01:13:51.426 --> 01:13:52.694
THE BUREAU FOR PRIVATE

01:13:52.761 --> 01:13:54.463
POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION. SO

01:13:54.530 --> 01:13:56.865
ANOTHER EXTENSIVE- PROCESS AND

01:13:56.932 --> 01:13:58.634
IT SEEMS O ME THAT. AS YOU AND

01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:00.135
I INDICATED THAT THERE IS

01:14:00.202 --> 01:14:02.538
ALREADY AN EXTENSIVE TIME LINE-

01:14:02.604 --> 01:14:04.206
OR ACTUALLY WERE TRYING TO SET

01:14:04.273 --> 01:14:07.609
UP A TIME LINE- SO. WHY IS

01:14:07.676 --> 01:14:10.179
THERE A NEED FOR. TO PROCESS

01:14:10.245 --> 01:14:18.787
THESE. FOR PRIVIL GE. SHE FOR

01:14:18.854 --> 01:14:21.390
CALLING THE- THE BUREAU OF

01:14:21.456 --> 01:14:23.859
PRIVATE SECONDARY LOOK AT A

01:14:23.926 --> 01:14:26.461
PROGRAM BASED ON ITS ITS

01:14:26.528 --> 01:14:27.462
INFRASTRUCTURE ITS FISCAL

01:14:27.529 --> 01:14:30.032
HEALTH YEAH- IT STE

01:14:30.098 --> 01:14:32.100
INSTITUTIONAL IF YOU WILL AND

01:14:32.167 --> 01:14:35.771
OUR FOCUS IS SPECIFIC TO THAT

01:14:35.838 --> 01:14:37.372
THE ACADEMIC PROGRAM INVOLVED

01:14:37.439 --> 01:14:40.776
SO THE TO SORT OF DOVETAIL

01:14:40.843 --> 01:14:42.511
TOGETHER. THERE IS NOT. AN

01:14:42.578 --> 01:14:43.579
APPRECIABLE AMOUNT OF

01:14:43.645 --> 01:14:46.782
REDUNDANCY BUT WHEN ISSUES DO

01:14:46.849 --> 01:14:48.951
CROP UP FOR EXAMPLE ACOUPLE

01:14:49.017 --> 01:14:50.219
YEARS AGO I THINK A LOT OF YOU

01:14:50.285 --> 01:14:51.987
ESPECIALLY. THOSE OF YOU IN THE

01:14:52.054 --> 01:14:53.989
SAN DIEGO LOS ANGELES AREA

01:14:54.056 --> 01:14:54.489
REMEMBER THAT WE HAD A

01:14:54.556 --> 01:14:56.625
SITUATION WHERE THE SCHOOL

01:14:56.692 --> 01:14:59.361
ABRUPTLY CLOSED ITS DOORS AND-

01:14:59.428 --> 01:15:01.096
WE HAD TO SCRAMBLE AND WE

01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:02.297
WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH THE

01:15:02.364 --> 01:15:05.100
BUREAU. TO ENSURE THAT THERE

01:15:05.167 --> 01:15:05.901
WAS A TEACH OUT THAT THE

01:15:05.968 --> 01:15:08.270
STUDENTS WERE ABLE TO FINISH

01:15:08.337 --> 01:15:11.607
THEIR PROGRAMS DESPITE THE- THE

01:15:11.673 --> 01:15:14.509
PROGRAM ITSELF RUN OFF. SO WE

01:15:14.576 --> 01:15:15.777
DO WORK WELL TOGETHER WE

01:15:15.844 --> 01:15:18.013
COMMUNICATE ON ON THE ISSUES I

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:20.649
THINK WE SHARE INFORMATION-

01:15:20.716 --> 01:15:22.951
VERY WELL. HE ACTUALLY USED TO

01:15:23.018 --> 01:15:24.786
BE MY UPSTAIRS NEIGHBORS IT WAS

01:15:24.853 --> 01:15:26.054
A LOT EASIER TO RUN UPSTAIRS

01:15:26.121 --> 01:15:29.324
BUT- I THINK I THINK WE FOUND-

01:15:29.391 --> 01:15:30.993
THAT WE WORK WELL TOGETHER I

01:15:31.059 --> 01:15:33.862
THINK OF. OUR NURSES GEN

01:15:33.929 --> 01:15:35.497
ESPECIALLY ARE SUPERVISING

01:15:35.564 --> 01:15:37.833
NURSING. EDUCATION CONSULTANT.

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:40.469
HAS BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE. A LOT

01:15:40.535 --> 01:15:42.004
OF DIALOGUE BACK AND FORTH

01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:44.006
WHERE WE SHARED. NOT JUST THE

01:15:44.072 --> 01:15:45.507
INFORMATION ON CURRENT

01:15:45.574 --> 01:15:46.975
SITUATIONS BUT THE WAY WE DO

01:15:47.042 --> 01:15:50.512
BUSINESS- WOULD IT BE BETTER TO

01:15:50.579 --> 01:15:54.316
HAVE A SINGLE ENTITY. POSSIBLY

01:15:54.383 --> 01:15:57.219
POSSIBLY BUT AT THE SAME TIME

01:15:57.286 --> 01:15:58.020
WE DON'T HAVE THE

01:15:58.086 --> 01:15:59.821
INFRASTRUCTURE TO REALLY

01:15:59.888 --> 01:16:02.658
EVALUATE- IT'S FISCAL HEALTH

01:16:02.724 --> 01:16:05.394
FOR EXAMPLE- THAT WOULD REQUIRE

01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:08.263
SOME VERY DEEP ANALYSIS AND HE

01:16:08.330 --> 01:16:11.433
DOES NOT HAVE THE- CAPABILITIES

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:13.268
TO EVALUATE WHETHER THAT

01:16:13.335 --> 01:16:13.869
NURSING PROGRAM AT THAT SITE

01:16:13.936 --> 01:16:17.039
CHECK PROGRAM MEETS ALL THE

01:16:17.105 --> 01:16:21.143
CRITERIA AND HOW AND WHY. SO

01:16:21.209 --> 01:16:23.211
ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE PROCESS

01:16:23.278 --> 01:16:24.579
IS NOT DIFFICULT THEREOF OR

01:16:24.646 --> 01:16:25.781
THAT THERE ARE THERE THERE IS

01:16:25.847 --> 01:16:27.616
DUPLICATION IN THE INTERVIEW

01:16:27.683 --> 01:16:36.124
PROCESS HE'S. I'M SORRY MR FONG

01:16:36.191 --> 01:16:37.926
THE SOUND CUT IN AND OUT ON THE

01:16:37.993 --> 01:16:39.261
OR ARE YOU SAYING THAT THERE IS

01:16:39.328 --> 01:16:40.495
NO DUPLICATION IN THE PROBLEM

01:16:40.562 --> 01:16:42.464
THE TO PROCESS THESE OR- ARE

01:16:42.531 --> 01:16:43.432
YOU SAYING THAT THERE IS

01:16:43.498 --> 01:16:45.334
DUPLICATION THAT NEEDS TO BE.

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:51.306
HAMMERED OUT. I DON'T THINK

01:16:51.373 --> 01:16:52.574
THERE'S DUPLICATION I THINK

01:16:52.641 --> 01:16:55.377
THERE AREAS THAT WE- MUST WORK

01:16:55.444 --> 01:16:57.913
TOGETHER TO DO. THE PEOPLE'S

01:16:57.980 --> 01:17:00.048
BUSINESS BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S

01:17:00.115 --> 01:17:02.918
DUPLICATIVE SO I'M I'M I'M

01:17:02.985 --> 01:17:04.419
READING THE ANALYSIS THAT WAS

01:17:04.486 --> 01:17:05.821
PROVIDED BY THE COMMITTEE STAFF

01:17:05.887 --> 01:17:08.890

ISSUES REGARDING REVOLVING

01:18:10.018 --> 01:18:11.620
AROUND THE ACADEMIC PROGRAM

01:18:11.686 --> 01:18:14.823

01:18:51.793 --> 01:18:52.294
LOOKING AT THOSE FACTORS AS

01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:56.698
WELL. I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE.

01:18:56.765 --> 01:18:58.800
YOUR ANSWERS I JUST WOULD SAY

01:18:58.867 --> 01:19:00.969
THAT- IT SEEMS TO BE THAT THERE

01:19:01.036 --> 01:19:02.971
IS NEEDED IMPROVEMENT I THINK I

01:19:03.038 --> 01:19:04.139
THINK EVERYONE HERE CAN SEE

01:19:04.206 --> 01:19:06.608
THAT- THERE IS SOME DUPLICATION

01:19:06.675 --> 01:19:08.376
I WOULD I WOULD VENTURE TO BET

01:19:08.443 --> 01:19:10.212
THAT AN OBJECTIVE REVIEW. WITH

01:19:10.278 --> 01:19:12.380
YOU THAT THERE IS- I WOULD ECHO

01:19:12.447 --> 01:19:14.516
WHAT THE SENATOR SAID THERE IS

01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:16.284
A NEED FOR. MORE MEDICAL

01:19:16.351 --> 01:19:17.886
PROFESSIONALS- ESPECIALLY IN

01:19:17.953 --> 01:19:19.988
THE AREA OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY-

01:19:20.055 --> 01:19:21.123
WE HAVE AND THE PANDEMIC AS

01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:24.292
REVEALED- THE STRUCTURAL ISSUES

01:19:24.359 --> 01:19:26.461
THAT- I BELIEVE WE ALL KNOW HAS

01:19:26.528 --> 01:19:28.130
EXISTED FOR A WHILE- INTO

01:19:28.196 --> 01:19:30.165
WHETHER- THE PANDEMIC HAS

01:19:30.232 --> 01:19:31.900
ACCELERATED THESE NEEDS WE'RE

01:19:31.967 --> 01:19:33.101
CERTAINLY I THINK IS THE CASE

01:19:33.168 --> 01:19:33.869
IS THE AND PUBLIC

01:19:33.935 --> 01:19:36.238
UNDERSTATEMENT OF THE MORNING-

01:19:36.304 --> 01:19:38.473
I THINK WE CERTAINLY DO NEED TO

01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:41.209
LOOK AT- PUTTING. WE'RE

01:19:41.276 --> 01:19:42.277
IMPROVING THE PROCESS

01:19:42.344 --> 01:19:45.480
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE A OF AN

01:19:45.547 --> 01:19:46.114
APPARENT BACKLOG OF FIFTY FOUR

01:19:46.181 --> 01:19:48.049
SCHOOLS- THEY'RE LOOKING FOR

01:19:48.116 --> 01:19:50.719
APPROVAL- FOLLOWING UP ON ON MY

01:19:50.785 --> 01:19:53.088
OTHER COLLEAGUES THAT THAT.

01:19:53.155 --> 01:19:56.658
THAT THE- THERE NEEDS TO BE-

01:19:56.725 --> 01:19:59.294
TIMELINES AND- AND IMPROVEMENT

01:19:59.361 --> 01:20:01.463
OF THE PROCESS SO THAT- THERE'S

01:20:01.530 --> 01:20:02.931
THE NEED NO AND KNOWLEDGE OF

01:20:02.998 --> 01:20:03.865
DEADLINES AND EVERYTHING ELSE

01:20:03.932 --> 01:20:05.634
LIKE THAT- I THINK THAT THERE

01:20:05.700 --> 01:20:07.202
NEEDS TO BE A SIGNIFICANT

01:20:07.269 --> 01:20:08.570
AMOUNT OF INFORMATION PROVIDED

01:20:08.637 --> 01:20:09.804
IN THE WORK TO BE DONE TO

01:20:09.871 --> 01:20:13.708
IMPROVE THAT PROCESS SO. I

01:20:13.775 --> 01:20:14.242
APPRECIATE THE ANSWERS AND

01:20:14.309 --> 01:20:15.844

ACTUALLY UP ALSO TO SOME

01:20:22.684 --> 01:20:23.752
QUESTIONS THAT FROM CENTER ROTH

01:20:23.818 --> 01:20:25.053
AND JUST FOR FULL DISCLOSURE I

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:26.888
MYSELF ACTUALLY SERVED ON THE

01:20:26.955 --> 01:20:27.822
BOARD OF AN ACCREDITATION.

01:20:27.889 --> 01:20:30.258
AGENCY AND- NATIONAL WONDER

01:20:30.325 --> 01:20:31.560
TRADITION COUNSELING GRADUATE

01:20:31.626 --> 01:20:33.528
MEDICAL EDUCATION. AND I MYSELF

01:20:33.595 --> 01:20:35.297
ALSO WAS A DIRECTOR OF

01:20:35.363 --> 01:20:36.398
EDUCATION PROGRAM THOSE

01:20:36.464 --> 01:20:37.933
ACCREDITED THERE FOR NEW WAS

01:20:37.999 --> 01:20:39.434
LIKE TO HAVE TO. SUBMIT

01:20:39.501 --> 01:20:41.436
PAPERWORK AND DOCUMENTS STUFF

01:20:41.503 --> 01:20:43.205
FOR ACCREDITATION SO I'VE BEEN

01:20:43.271 --> 01:20:46.341
ON BOTH SIDES. THE ISSUE AND

01:20:46.408 --> 01:20:47.342
IT'S CERTAINLY ON- AT LEAST

01:20:47.409 --> 01:20:48.143
HAVE SOME UNDERSTAND THE

01:20:48.210 --> 01:20:50.111
CHALLENGES THE BOARD HAS AND IN

01:20:50.178 --> 01:20:51.646
THOSE ROLES RIGHT HAVING TO

01:20:51.713 --> 01:20:54.182
PROVE PROGRAMS AND SO FORTH- SO

01:20:54.249 --> 01:20:55.784
I GUESS THE- BRIEF COMMENT AND

01:20:55.850 --> 01:20:57.185
THEN A QUESTION- THE COMMENT

01:20:57.252 --> 01:20:58.987
IS- I KNOW AN ISSUE SIXTEEN

01:20:59.054 --> 01:21:01.056
CLINICAL PLACEMENTS- AS A

01:21:01.122 --> 01:21:03.124
BOARD- PROBABLY BUT CHALLENGED

01:21:03.191 --> 01:21:04.025
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT REALLY IN A

01:21:04.092 --> 01:21:05.227
ROLL OF FINDING CLINICAL

01:21:05.293 --> 01:21:06.595
PLACEMENTS BUT THIS IS

01:21:06.661 --> 01:21:08.063
SOMETHING THAT'S NOT UNIQUE

01:21:08.129 --> 01:21:08.964
CERTAINLY TO THIS PARTICULAR

01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:11.066
PROFESSION. AND WE DO NEED TO

01:21:11.132 --> 01:21:14.636
THINK ABOUT- FRANKLY- YOU KNOW.

01:21:14.703 --> 01:21:16.905
HAVING TRAINEES COSTS MONEY FOR

01:21:16.972 --> 01:21:18.473
ANY CLINICAL SITE ALL RIGHT I

01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:20.609
MEAN I DID RESEARCH AND- AND

01:21:20.675 --> 01:21:22.444
WORKFORCE AND THE COST OF

01:21:22.510 --> 01:21:24.145
ACTUALLY TRAINING. IN AND

01:21:24.212 --> 01:21:25.947
CLINICAL SITES AND DAY AT AND

01:21:26.014 --> 01:21:28.216
SO OFTEN TIMES WE- EXPECT THE

01:21:28.283 --> 01:21:29.784
CHARITY OF THE BUYER'S CLINICAL

01:21:29.851 --> 01:21:31.319
SITES BUT THAT'S NOT WORKING

01:21:31.386 --> 01:21:32.854
OUT EFFECTIVE MANY

01:21:32.921 --> 01:21:33.922
UNFORTUNATELY MANY PRIVATE

01:21:33.989 --> 01:21:35.857
INSTITUTIONS. GET THEIR

01:21:35.924 --> 01:21:36.424
CLINICAL SITE BY ACTUALLY

01:21:36.491 --> 01:21:38.026
PAYING FOR THEM. WHICH ACTUALLY

01:21:38.093 --> 01:21:39.728
DISADVANTAGES SOMETIMES PUBLIC

01:21:39.794 --> 01:21:41.930
PROGRAMS- HOOCH MAY NOT HAVE

01:21:41.997 --> 01:21:42.998
ITS NAY RESOURCES SO I THINK

01:21:43.064 --> 01:21:45.000
JUST I WANTED PAN ON THAT FOR.

01:21:45.066 --> 01:21:47.469
US TO CONSIDER IN TERMS OF.

01:21:47.535 --> 01:21:48.470
WHAT WE DO IN TERMS OF

01:21:48.536 --> 01:21:49.604
PROVIDING CLINICAL SITES ONLY

01:21:49.671 --> 01:21:51.106
FOR THIS- PARTICULAR PROFESSION

01:21:51.172 --> 01:21:52.707
BUT OTHERS THE QUESTION I HAVE

01:21:52.774 --> 01:21:55.010
FOR YOU THOUGH IS THAT. I DO WE

01:21:55.076 --> 01:21:59.314
TALK ABOUT DUPLICATION. BETWEEN

01:21:59.381 --> 01:22:00.515
BETWEEN ACCREDITATION AGENCIES

01:22:00.582 --> 01:22:02.584
IN THE BOARD'S ROLE. DOES THE%

01:22:02.651 --> 01:22:04.185
BOARD IT'S AN AND YOU'D

01:22:04.252 --> 01:22:05.587
MENTIONED ALSO ABOUT LOOKING AT

01:22:05.654 --> 01:22:07.289
STANDARDIZED CURRICULUM AS WELL

01:22:07.355 --> 01:22:12.661
AND- AND THE WORK BEHIND THAT

01:22:12.727 --> 01:22:14.062
IT DOES THE- WHEN YOU- A-

01:22:14.129 --> 01:22:16.698
SCHOOL. I'D DO YOU ACTUALLY GET

01:22:16.765 --> 01:22:18.600
ALL THE DOCUMENTS TO THE SCHOOL

01:22:18.667 --> 01:22:22.404
ALSO- BASICALLY DO YOU- THE

01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:23.305
DOCUMENTS THEY HAVE TO SUBMIT

01:22:23.371 --> 01:22:25.507
FOR ACCREDITATION DO CAN THEY

01:22:25.573 --> 01:22:27.575
JUST SUBMIT THE SIMILAR SAME TO

01:22:27.642 --> 01:22:28.543
DOCUMENT YOU MAY WANT TO

01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:29.444
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON TOP

01:22:29.511 --> 01:22:31.146
OF THAT BUT INSTEAD OF TRYING

01:22:31.212 --> 01:22:31.913
TO HAVE TO HAVE YOUR OWN

01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:33.848
VERSION OF THE SAME THING SO

01:22:33.915 --> 01:22:34.749
BASIS SO IN TERMS OF TRYING TO

01:22:34.816 --> 01:22:36.551
REDUCE THE- THE SORT OF

01:22:36.618 --> 01:22:38.953
OVERHEAD. OF US SUBMITTING AN

01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:41.156
APPLICATION AND THEN- IN TERMS

01:22:41.222 --> 01:22:43.358
OF YOUR REVIEW PROCESS DO YOU

01:22:43.425 --> 01:22:45.427
TAKE ACCOUNT OF WHAT THE

01:22:45.493 --> 01:22:47.762
SCHOOLS HAVE TO SUBMIT TO OTHER

01:22:47.829 --> 01:22:48.630
AGENTS OTHER ACCREDITING

01:22:48.697 --> 01:22:51.166
BODIES. IN YOUR APPROVAL TO TRY

01:22:51.232 --> 01:22:52.233
THIS AGAIN STREAMLINED THE

01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:55.036
PROCESS FOR THE- FOR THE

01:22:55.103 --> 01:22:58.506
SCHOOLS THEY'RE TRYING TO

01:22:58.573 --> 01:23:02.143
SUBMIT. SOME ADULTS PAPERWORK.

01:23:02.210 --> 01:23:03.845
I THINK I'LL GIVE YOU A LITTLE

01:23:03.912 --> 01:23:04.579
BIT OF AN ANSWER THEN I'LL TURN

01:23:04.646 --> 01:23:06.381
IT OVER TO MS YAMAGUCHI HAVING

01:23:06.448 --> 01:23:07.782
JUST BEEN THROUGH MIGHT BE

01:23:07.849 --> 01:23:10.652
VNPT. ACCREDITATION PROCESS

01:23:10.719 --> 01:23:11.786
DURING THE PANDEMIC LAST

01:23:11.853 --> 01:23:15.290
SUMMER- THERE IS SOME OVERLAP

01:23:15.357 --> 01:23:17.992
AND I DRAW FROM SO WE ARE

01:23:18.059 --> 01:23:19.894
WATCHING ACCREDITED BECAUSE

01:23:19.961 --> 01:23:20.929
WE'RE COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHERE I

01:23:20.995 --> 01:23:23.965
WORK- AND SO I AM ABLE TO DRAW

01:23:24.032 --> 01:23:26.835
FROM SOME OF THOSE. DOCUMENTS

01:23:26.901 --> 01:23:28.770
AND THEY DO FIT IN TO WHAT I

01:23:28.837 --> 01:23:31.005
HAVE TO TURN IN. TO THE BBMP

01:23:31.072 --> 01:23:33.341
TEAM BUT TRULY THE ACCREDITING

01:23:33.408 --> 01:23:34.809
AGENCIES ARE LOOKING AT

01:23:34.876 --> 01:23:36.644
DIFFERENT THINGS ADDITIONALLY

01:23:36.711 --> 01:23:38.480
IN NURSING THERE IS NATIONAL

01:23:38.546 --> 01:23:40.415
ACCREDITATION CALLED HE SAID HE

01:23:40.482 --> 01:23:44.586
C. N. THAT. THAT WAS A CREDIT A

01:23:44.652 --> 01:23:46.154
CREDIT. THE END PROGRAM. AND

01:23:46.221 --> 01:23:49.023
SOME HAVE CHOSEN TO GET THAT

01:23:49.090 --> 01:23:50.792
ADDITIONAL NATIONAL

01:23:50.859 --> 01:23:52.694
ACCREDITATION WHICH VERY MUCH

01:23:52.761 --> 01:23:54.496
DUCK TALES WHAT THE BOARD.

01:23:54.562 --> 01:23:56.364
LOOKS AT AND THEN IT'S VERY

01:23:56.431 --> 01:23:58.066
EASY TO USE THOSE DOCUMENTS TO

01:23:58.133 --> 01:24:00.668
CROSS OVER BUT TRULY THESE

01:24:00.735 --> 01:24:02.404
ACCREDITING AGENCIES ARE

01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:03.772
LOOKING AT SOMETHING DIFFERENT

01:24:03.838 --> 01:24:05.240
THAN WHAT THE NEC IS

01:24:05.306 --> 01:24:07.075
EVALUATING. WHEN THEY COME IN

01:24:07.142 --> 01:24:09.210
AND ARE LOOKING AT VERY PROGRAM

01:24:09.277 --> 01:24:11.813
SPECIFIC ISSUES. TO ENSURE THAT

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:14.382
NURSING NURSES ARE GRADUATING

01:24:14.449 --> 01:24:17.252
WITH ADEQUATE INFORMATION TO

01:24:17.318 --> 01:24:19.354
TAKE CARE OF PATIENTS AND IT'S

01:24:19.421 --> 01:24:20.989
REALLY PROTECTING THE PUBLIC IN

01:24:21.055 --> 01:24:26.628
THAT METHODOLOGY. MS YAMAGUCHI.

01:24:26.694 --> 01:24:28.062
I DON'T THINK IT HAD ANYTHING

01:24:28.129 --> 01:24:30.465
TO THAT. THANK YOU WELL I GUESS

01:24:30.532 --> 01:24:31.900
I WOULD JUST SAY IS THAT- IT

01:24:31.966 --> 01:24:33.234
MIGHT BE WORTH A CONVERSATION

01:24:33.301 --> 01:24:34.702
WITH THE VARIOUS ACCREDITATION

01:24:34.769 --> 01:24:35.537
AGENCIES I KNOW THAT'S NOT

01:24:35.603 --> 01:24:36.871
EXACTLY YOU'RE LOOKING IS

01:24:36.938 --> 01:24:38.239
ACTUALLY THE SAME THING BUT I

01:24:38.306 --> 01:24:39.707
THINK WE'RE TERMS AGAIN TRYING

01:24:39.774 --> 01:24:41.843
TO REDUCE DUPLICATION AND

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:44.679
STREAMLINE THE PROCESS- THAT-

01:24:44.746 --> 01:24:46.114
THERE MAY BE SOME BENEFIT

01:24:46.181 --> 01:24:47.582
TRYING TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE-

01:24:47.649 --> 01:24:49.751
HOW HOW THE TWO PROCESSES. WELL

01:24:49.818 --> 01:24:51.686
YOU KNOW A LINER NOT A LINE AND

01:24:51.753 --> 01:24:53.788
WHAT AND HOW DO WE THE FLOW OF

01:24:53.855 --> 01:24:56.157
INFORMATION- THAT HAS TO HAPPEN

01:24:56.224 --> 01:24:57.892
AND THAT EXPENSE RELATED TO

01:24:57.959 --> 01:25:01.129
THAT AS WELL BOTH IN TIME AND-

01:25:01.196 --> 01:25:01.963
MANPOWER MISTER MANPOWER THANK

01:25:02.030 --> 01:25:04.899

UP QUESTION TO THE QUESTION MY

01:25:09.471 --> 01:25:11.039
COLLEAGUE FROM THE ASEMBLY ASK

01:25:11.105 --> 01:25:13.107
ABOUT TO SCHOOL APPROVALS. YOU

01:25:13.174 --> 01:25:14.876
MENTIONED UNIVERSAL CURRICULUM

01:25:14.943 --> 01:25:17.312
AND TO ME THAT- IF IMPOSE THAT

01:25:17.378 --> 01:25:19.414
WOULD SEEM A BIT- POTENTIALLY

01:25:19.481 --> 01:25:21.783
DISRUPTIVE ANYWAY IN IN IN THE

01:25:21.850 --> 01:25:23.852
STATE. BUT WOULD THERE BE ANY

01:25:23.918 --> 01:25:25.653
IMPEDIMENT FOR THE BOARD TO

01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:28.890
ADOPT A COMMON CURRICULUM

01:25:28.957 --> 01:25:31.559
COMMON POLICIES AND PROCEDURES.

01:25:31.626 --> 01:25:36.030
COVERING VOCATIONAL. NURSE

01:25:36.097 --> 01:25:36.664
EDUCATION FOR EXAMPLE. THAT IF

01:25:36.731 --> 01:25:40.869
A PROPOSED ADOPTED THOSE. THE

01:25:40.935 --> 01:25:42.704
APPROVAL PROCESS WOULD BE MUCH

01:25:42.770 --> 01:25:47.575
EXPEDITED. NOT REQUIRED BUT IF

01:25:47.642 --> 01:25:50.778
ADOPTED A COMMON CURRICULUM.

01:25:50.845 --> 01:25:52.347
COLIN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

01:25:52.413 --> 01:25:55.316
AS A SET. AND IF THE SCHOOL

01:25:55.383 --> 01:25:59.053
SAID YES THAT'S FINE WITH US.

01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:00.922
HOW MUCH TIME WOULD THAT CUT

01:26:00.989 --> 01:26:03.291
OFF OF YOUR APPROVAL PROCESS.

01:26:03.358 --> 01:26:04.893
AND WOULD THAT HELP TO REDUCE

01:26:04.959 --> 01:26:09.764
THE BACKLOG. I AM GOING TO TURN

01:26:09.831 --> 01:26:10.798
THIS OVER TO ME YOU HAVE A GOOD

01:26:10.865 --> 01:26:12.700
YEAR BUT I DID WANT TO MENTION

01:26:12.767 --> 01:26:15.737
THAT- THE STATE OF OREGON HAS

01:26:15.803 --> 01:26:20.275
ALREADY INSTITUTED- AND- THE-

01:26:20.341 --> 01:26:22.143
STATEWIDE CURRICULUM. AND THEY

01:26:22.210 --> 01:26:24.178
DID IT- SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND

01:26:24.245 --> 01:26:25.713
IT'S BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL

01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:27.415
SCHOOLS CAN CHOOSE TO NOT BE

01:26:27.482 --> 01:26:29.284
PART OF THAT. BUT I THINK THAT

01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:32.720
IT HAS- DEFINITELY CONTRIBUTED

01:26:32.787 --> 01:26:36.724
TO THEIR ABILITY. TO PRODUCE

01:26:36.791 --> 01:26:39.527
WELL EQUIPPED NURSES TO COME

01:26:39.594 --> 01:26:42.130
OUT INTO THE FIELD AND IT IS

01:26:42.196 --> 01:26:43.665
ALSO PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY

01:26:43.731 --> 01:26:44.832
THAT IF A STUDENT NEEDS TO MOVE

01:26:44.899 --> 01:26:46.367
FROM ONE AREA TO ANOTHER WITHIN

01:26:46.434 --> 01:26:48.036
THE STATE YOU'RE ABLE TO

01:26:48.102 --> 01:26:49.904
TRANSFER IN THOSE PROGRAMS SO I

01:26:49.971 --> 01:26:52.106
STATEWIDE CURRICULUM WOULD BE A

01:26:52.173 --> 01:26:53.675
HUGE ADVANTAGE I THINK TO

01:26:53.741 --> 01:26:56.611
STUDENTS AND TO CONSUMERS WHO

01:26:56.678 --> 01:27:00.181
KNOW THAT THEIR- THEY ARE-

01:27:00.248 --> 01:27:01.449
GETTING INTEREST IS TRAIN

01:27:01.516 --> 01:27:03.952
THROUGH ITS METHODOLOGY- SO YES

01:27:04.018 --> 01:27:05.153
IT WOULD BE A BIG UNDERTAKING.

01:27:05.219 --> 01:27:07.355
BUT I THINK IN THAT THE LONG

01:27:07.422 --> 01:27:09.390
TERM GAIN FOR NURSING AND FOR

01:27:09.457 --> 01:27:11.459
THE PUBLIC WOULD BE HUGE

01:27:11.526 --> 01:27:19.334
YAMAGUCHI. I THINK- MISTER

01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:19.867
CHAIRMAN I THINK TEAR YOUR

01:27:19.934 --> 01:27:24.038
QUESTION. WOULD IT SAVE TIME I

01:27:24.105 --> 01:27:25.373
WOULD THINK IN THE IN THE LONG

01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:28.610
RANGE YES IT WOULD- JUST

01:27:28.676 --> 01:27:29.177
BECAUSE WE WOULD BE ABLE TO

01:27:29.243 --> 01:27:31.913
HAVE THAT AS A AS A GIVEN AND

01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:33.948
THEN. THE NEC'S WOULD BE ABLE

01:27:34.015 --> 01:27:35.116
LOOK AT ALL THE OTHER FACTORS

01:27:35.183 --> 01:27:37.185
INVOLVED ESPECIALLY THE MORE

01:27:37.251 --> 01:27:40.488
REGIONALLY BASED ONES- THE

01:27:40.555 --> 01:27:41.055
CHALLENGE OF COURSE IS THAT

01:27:41.122 --> 01:27:43.925
SHORT TERM. IT WOULD DELAY THE

01:27:43.992 --> 01:27:44.792
PROCESS BECAUSE WE WOULD NEED

01:27:44.859 --> 01:27:48.262
TO- I WOULD NEED TO PROBABLY RE

01:27:48.329 --> 01:27:48.796
ASSIGNED A STAFF PERSON TO

01:27:48.863 --> 01:27:51.466
DEVELOP. YOU KNOW BASED ON ALL

01:27:51.532 --> 01:27:53.234
THE BEST PRACTICES THT WE'VE

01:27:53.301 --> 01:27:55.036
SEEN FROM. THE PROGRAMS THAT

01:27:55.103 --> 01:27:56.871
ARE DOING REALLY REALLY WELL

01:27:56.938 --> 01:27:58.640
AND HAVE HISTORICALLY ALWAYS

01:27:58.706 --> 01:28:01.109
DONE SO- AND THEN OF COURSE

01:28:01.175 --> 01:28:04.579
THERE IS THE POINT THAT. I WOOD

01:28:04.646 --> 01:28:06.748
AGAIN THIS WOULD BE SUBJECT TO

01:28:06.814 --> 01:28:10.451
RULE MAKING. AND THAT IS.

01:28:10.518 --> 01:28:12.186
PROBABLY A YEAR OR MORE OF A

01:28:12.253 --> 01:28:14.989
PROCESS- LOOK I'M I'M

01:28:15.056 --> 01:28:16.357
SUGGESTING THAT PEOPLE HAVE

01:28:16.424 --> 01:28:19.627
CHOICE BUT- AS AS THE REGULATOR

01:28:19.694 --> 01:28:21.195
YOU MUSTKNOW WHAT YOU LOOK AT

01:28:21.262 --> 01:28:22.296
IT AND EXPECT TO SEE IN A

01:28:22.363 --> 01:28:24.198
CURRICULUM SO I'M NOT SURE THAT

01:28:24.265 --> 01:28:26.701
I UNDERSTAND WHY IT WOULD BE SO

01:28:26.768 --> 01:28:27.969
TERRIBLY DIFFICULT TO SPELL

01:28:28.036 --> 01:28:29.604
OUT. EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE

01:28:29.671 --> 01:28:31.239
LOOKING FOR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING

01:28:31.305 --> 01:28:33.107
FOR IN A CURRICULUM IN A COMMON

01:28:33.174 --> 01:28:35.810
CORE CURRICULUM WITH POLICIES

01:28:35.877 --> 01:28:37.645
AND PROCEDURES THAT COULD BE IS

01:28:37.712 --> 01:28:39.113
ON THE SHELF AND IF THE SCHOOL

01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:40.848
WANTS TO ACCEPTED. THEY

01:28:40.915 --> 01:28:42.183
ACCEPTED AND SAY GOOD WE'RE

01:28:42.250 --> 01:28:43.885
GOING TO GO WITH THAT SO YOU

01:28:43.951 --> 01:28:45.586
CAN MOVE ON TO SOMETHING ELSE

01:28:45.653 --> 01:28:47.755
BEYOND CURRICULUM POLICIES AND

01:28:47.822 --> 01:28:49.957
PROCEDURES I ASSUME IT'S BRICK

01:28:50.024 --> 01:28:51.793
AND MORTAR FACILITIES SINCE

01:28:51.859 --> 01:28:53.528
IT'S A CLINICAL PLACEMENTS AND

01:28:53.594 --> 01:28:54.662
ALL THE OTHER ISSUES THAT YOU

01:28:54.729 --> 01:28:56.197
LOOK AT. MISTRETTA MAKE IT

01:28:56.264 --> 01:28:58.800
SIMPLE AND I THINK OF WHAT THE

01:28:58.866 --> 01:28:59.934
PRESIDENT WAS SAYING WE'RE

01:29:00.001 --> 01:29:01.569
SAYING THE SAME THING SHE CALLS

01:29:01.636 --> 01:29:03.237
OF THE STATE CURRICULUM BUT IF

01:29:03.304 --> 01:29:05.039
THE STATE CURRICULUM A CHOICE

01:29:05.106 --> 01:29:08.710
SOMEONE CAN OPT OUT AND DO

01:29:08.776 --> 01:29:09.210
SOMETHING MORE. MORE- A

01:29:09.277 --> 01:29:11.279
SPECIFIC IF THEY WANT TO IF

01:29:11.345 --> 01:29:12.313
THEY WANT TO ENCOURAGE THE

01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:14.916
DELAY THAT THAT'S GOING TO-

01:29:14.982 --> 01:29:16.117
BECAUSE IN TERMS OF THE

01:29:16.184 --> 01:29:18.786
APPROVAL PROCESS I JUST AS THE

01:29:18.853 --> 01:29:19.353
TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT I DON'T

01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:21.656

CONVERSATIONS AT THE STAFF

01:29:38.639 --> 01:29:40.141

AND- I HAD THE PLEASURE OF

01:29:43.444 --> 01:29:45.480
SERVING IN THIS CAPACITY WHEN

01:29:45.546 --> 01:29:46.881
WE TOOK A LOOK AT THE SUNSET

01:29:46.948 --> 01:29:48.983

SPEAKING VERY PLAINLY ENGLISH

THE BOARD WAS A DISASTER. AND

01:29:57.291 --> 01:29:59.460
IN COMPARISON TO THE OTHER

01:29:59.527 --> 01:30:00.728
ENTITIES THAT WE HAVE A

01:30:00.795 --> 01:30:02.630

ELEGANT WAYS BUT- I SEE AND

IT'S- COMPLETE GROSS

01:30:26.654 --> 01:30:28.890

01:34:46.514 --> 01:34:49.216
REVENUE. THE ABILITY TO WORK-

01:34:49.283 --> 01:34:51.986
AND CERTAINLY LAST YEAR- WHEN

01:34:52.053 --> 01:34:54.121
THE NEC'S DROPPED EVERYTHING TO

01:34:54.188 --> 01:34:55.990

CERTAIN THAT THE EXISTING

THE IN THE PAST- BUT- TO MOVE

01:35:09.804 --> 01:35:13.307
FORWARD- I THINK WE OUTLINED A

01:35:13.374 --> 01:35:15.943
NUMBER OF. OF POSSIBLE PATHS IN

01:35:16.010 --> 01:35:18.946
THAT MANNER AND- IDEAS THAT

BOARD TO BE MORE FISCALLY

01:35:35.796 --> 01:35:38.866
SOUND- I THINK OUR REVENUE

01:35:39.867 --> 01:35:41.769
OF TIMES. NEEDS TO BE

01:35:41.836 --> 01:35:45.206

THE SCHOOL PROGRAM THREE. I

01:35:47.141 --> 01:35:48.943
THINK THIS IS A CONTRIBUTING

01:35:49.009 --> 01:35:52.046
CAUSE TO THE MUSHROOMING OF OUR

01:35:52.113 --> 01:35:55.649

APPRECIABLE WAITING LIST

01:36:07.094 --> 01:36:10.264
BECAUSE THE PROGRAMS WHO ARE

THE READY MISS TO MOVE FORWARD-

01:36:19.373 --> 01:36:21.575
IN BECAUSE THEY'VE MADE ALREADY

01:36:21.642 --> 01:36:23.844
A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT. VERY

01:36:23.911 --> 01:36:25.012
MUCH INCENTIVIZE TO MOVE

01:36:32.186 --> 01:36:34.021
NUMBER OF FACTORS AS I SAID I

01:36:34.088 --> 01:36:36.724

THROUGH THAT PROCESS AS WELL IN

01:37:46.126 --> 01:37:46.727
TWENTY TWENTY- BUT-

01:37:46.794 --> 01:37:48.062
UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE NOT ABLE TO

OF JUNE OF THIS YEAR TO START

01:37:53.534 --> 01:37:55.869
THAT PROCESS AS WELL SO I THINK

MOUNTAIN WOULD BE AS WELL- AND

01:38:21.428 --> 01:38:23.197
THE BOARD NEEDS TO I THINK

01:38:23.264 --> 01:38:25.633
REALLY STEP BACK AND ASSESS

01:38:25.699 --> 01:38:27.067

THIS LIST HAS BEEN MONITORED-

01:38:37.144 --> 01:38:39.046
ON ONGOING BASIS AND BUT REALLY

01:38:39.113 --> 01:38:40.881
THAT THE MONITORING IS YOUR

TRIAGING OR PRIORITIZATION

01:38:52.259 --> 01:38:55.863
THINK THERE'S- ONE OPPORTUNITY

01:38:55.929 --> 01:38:57.498
THAT I THINK WE DISCUSSED WITH

01:38:57.564 --> 01:38:59.767
THE COMMITTEE STAFF IS. WHAT IF

01:38:59.833 --> 01:39:02.002
WE HAD THE APPROVAL PROCESS

01:39:02.069 --> 01:39:04.705
MORE FRONT LOADED AND THEN THE

INITIAL LETTER INTENT WAS

01:39:06.674 --> 01:39:08.676

01:39:29.663 --> 01:39:33.033
MOST TURN KEY IF YOU WILL-

01:39:33.100 --> 01:39:33.667
WOULD HAVE AN ACCELERATED

01:39:33.734 --> 01:39:35.669
PROCESS. LIKE I SAID THERE'S A

01:39:35.736 --> 01:39:37.304
NUMBER OF ALL OF OPTIONS AND

01:39:37.371 --> 01:39:39.440
MEMBER OF- OF CONCEPTS AND I'M

01:39:39.506 --> 01:39:40.541
CERTAIN THEIR IDEAS THAT WE

01:39:40.607 --> 01:39:44.244
HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF- BUT AGAIN-

01:39:44.311 --> 01:39:50.150
I KNOW. IT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.

01:39:50.217 --> 01:39:53.153
SO IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE- OF LANE

01:39:53.220 --> 01:39:56.924
YOU YOU. AGAIN AS I SUBMIT I

01:39:56.990 --> 01:39:59.660
WAS HERE THREE YEARS AGO WHEN

WE DIDN'T THIS SENSE AT LAST

01:40:00.561 --> 01:40:01.995
TIME- AND THEN SUBSEQUENT

01:40:02.062 --> 01:40:04.431
ANDERSON YOUR APPOINTED BACK IN

01:40:04.498 --> 01:40:05.065
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE BOARD

01:40:05.132 --> 01:40:06.600
WAS IN SUCH A TERRIBLE

01:40:06.667 --> 01:40:09.203
POSITION. THAT THE BOARD'S

01:40:09.269 --> 01:40:11.338
AUTHORITY TO HIRE YOU WAS GIVEN

01:40:11.405 --> 01:40:12.139
TO THE OUT OF THE GOVERNOR'S

01:40:12.206 --> 01:40:14.541
OFFICE AND SO WHEN WE THINK

01:40:14.608 --> 01:40:15.142
ABOUT THAT OF THE

01:40:15.209 --> 01:40:17.978
ACCOUNTABILITY I APPRECIATE

01:40:18.045 --> 01:40:20.514

THE BOARD AND YOURSELF YOU KNEW

01:40:22.583 --> 01:40:24.551

01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:27.421
THAT THIS WAS A SIGNIFICANT

01:40:27.488 --> 01:40:30.524
PROBLEM. PRIOR TO THE JUST US

01:40:30.591 --> 01:40:32.159
HAVING THIS PROCESS AND THAT'S

01:40:32.226 --> 01:40:33.360
BY THE WAY WHY I THINK IT'S

01:40:33.427 --> 01:40:35.262
IMPORTANT IMPERATIVE THAT WE

01:40:35.329 --> 01:40:38.298

01:40:48.208 --> 01:40:50.144
TO TALK ABOUT. HERE THE

01:40:50.210 --> 01:40:52.813
PROBLEMS. AND IT'S DUE TO LACK

01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:54.248
OF STAFFING SO THEREFORE WE

01:40:54.314 --> 01:40:55.983
NEED MORE BUDGET OR THE OR WE

01:40:56.049 --> 01:40:58.051
STATUTORILY NEED SOME CHANGES.

01:42:04.485 --> 01:42:08.121
AND I THINK AND I WOULD HAVE TO

01:42:08.188 --> 01:42:10.791
GO BACK AND LOOK FOR CERTAIN. I

01:42:10.858 --> 01:42:13.293
THINK OF IT AT THAT POINT. THAT

01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:16.029
WAITING LIST WAS MUCH MORE

01:42:16.096 --> 01:42:17.197
MANAGEABLE I THINK IT WOULD

01:42:17.264 --> 01:42:19.299
HAVE BEEN. SOMEWHERE IN THE TWO

01:42:19.366 --> 01:42:22.736
DOZEN AREA. AND WE FOUGHT OF

01:42:22.803 --> 01:42:27.241
COURSE THAT STAFFING WOULD BUT

01:42:27.307 --> 01:42:29.176
NOT BEING ABLE TO TURN THAT

01:42:29.243 --> 01:42:34.715
CUSTOMER- I WAS INCORRECT-

01:42:34.781 --> 01:42:36.917
AGAIN WE THOUGHT TWENTY TWENTY

01:42:36.984 --> 01:42:38.585
ONE WE ARE FULLY STAFFED WE

01:42:38.652 --> 01:42:40.153
WOULD BE ABLE TO TURN THAT

01:42:40.220 --> 01:42:41.421
CORNER AND AGAIN I WAS

01:42:41.488 --> 01:42:47.261
INCORRECT- SO I DON'T HAVE AN

01:42:47.327 --> 01:42:49.730
EXCUSE I DON'T HAVE. A REASON

01:42:49.796 --> 01:42:53.433
PER SE OF NOT FLAGGING THIS AS-

01:42:53.500 --> 01:42:55.269
AS URGENT AS AN ISSUE AS AS I

01:42:55.335 --> 01:42:58.171
SHOULD HAVE PERHAPS- BUT THE

01:42:58.238 --> 01:43:01.375
BOARD'S PRIORITIES WERE TO.

01:43:01.441 --> 01:43:04.545
ENSURE THAT. THE LICENSING

01:43:04.611 --> 01:43:07.080
FUNCTIONS SOME WERE BROUGHT

01:43:07.147 --> 01:43:08.782
INTO ORDER TO FEED FORTUNATE

01:43:08.849 --> 01:43:11.251
FUNCTIONS WERE BROUGHT INTO

01:43:11.318 --> 01:43:15.088
ORDER YEAH. THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT

01:43:15.155 --> 01:43:18.525
FOR NOW. SO EVER ENTERED IN

01:43:18.592 --> 01:43:20.961
HERE HE SAYS THAT YOU FAILED TO

01:43:21.028 --> 01:43:22.930
IDENTIFY THAT THIS WOULD

01:43:22.996 --> 01:43:24.831
INCREASE THE BACKLOG WOULD

01:43:24.898 --> 01:43:25.432
INCREASE AND THAT YOU FAIL TO

01:43:25.499 --> 01:43:28.335
TAKE. THE ACTION AS EXECUTIVE

01:43:28.402 --> 01:43:31.338
OFFICER OFFICER TO ADEQUATELY

01:43:31.405 --> 01:43:31.972
ADDRESS THIS ISSUE OF THIS BACK

01:43:32.039 --> 01:43:40.447
WHILE. THAT WOULD BE FAIR SIR.

01:43:40.514 --> 01:43:45.352
I'M LOOKING AT THE. PROPOSED OF

01:43:45.419 --> 01:43:49.122
THE SCHOOLS THAT ARE INSIDE THE

01:43:49.189 --> 01:43:49.690
SCHOOLS THAT HAVE SUBMITTED

01:43:49.756 --> 01:43:52.259
APPLICATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE THAT

01:43:52.326 --> 01:43:54.161
I'M LOOKING AT. THE SCHOOL IN

01:43:54.227 --> 01:43:57.264
RANCHO CORDOVA IRWINDALE. OR LA

01:43:57.331 --> 01:43:59.533
HABRA OR SALINAS OF COURSE WE

01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:01.501
WANT TO FOCUS ON THE HARD TO

01:44:01.568 --> 01:44:02.970
SERVE IN HARD TO REACH AREAS.

01:44:03.036 --> 01:44:04.304
BUT THESE APPLICATIONS WERE

01:44:04.371 --> 01:44:06.740
SUBMITTED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND

01:44:06.807 --> 01:44:09.309
AND- TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE

01:44:09.376 --> 01:44:10.143
EARLIER THIS YEAR TWO THOUSAND

01:44:10.210 --> 01:44:11.612
TWENTY ONE. SO WITH THE CURRENT

01:44:11.678 --> 01:44:16.950
BACKLOG. IF WE JUST DO SOME

01:44:17.017 --> 01:44:21.388
BASIC MATH. OF WHAT WHAT'S

01:44:21.455 --> 01:44:22.322
THREE ASSESS WHAT'S YOUR

01:44:22.389 --> 01:44:23.724
ASSESSMENT OF WERE TO ASK YOU

01:44:23.790 --> 01:44:26.026
APPROXIMATELY HOW MANY SCHOOLS

01:44:26.093 --> 01:44:27.594
DO YOU APPROVE A YEAR. BUT THE

01:44:27.661 --> 01:44:28.495
ANSWER POTS WERE HOW MANY

01:44:28.562 --> 01:44:32.499
SCHOOLS. CAN WE ASSUME THAT YOU

01:44:32.566 --> 01:44:38.872
APPROVE EACH YEAR. I WOULD

01:44:38.939 --> 01:44:41.408
THINK BETWEEN TWENTY AND THIRTY.

01:44:41.475 --> 01:44:41.975
TWENTY AND THIRTY SCHOOLS A

01:44:42.042 --> 01:44:46.346
YEAR. I WOULD THINK SO OKAY SO

01:44:46.413 --> 01:44:48.749
IF I'M IF I IF OF SUBMIT AN

01:44:48.815 --> 01:44:53.487
APPLICATION BACK IN. TWO

01:44:53.553 --> 01:44:54.087
THOUSAND TWENTY ONE. I'LL BE

01:44:54.154 --> 01:44:56.023
ABLE TO BEAT THAT THAT TIMELINE

01:44:56.089 --> 01:45:01.161
THAT USS ABOUT. THREE YEARS.

01:45:01.228 --> 01:45:03.864
UNDER EXISTING STRUCTURE YES

01:45:03.930 --> 01:45:07.100
PROBABLY THREE YEARS SO AS YOU

01:45:07.167 --> 01:45:08.001
CAN SEE THAT THERE IS

01:45:08.068 --> 01:45:09.970
SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES TO THIS

01:45:10.037 --> 01:45:11.004
AND IT'S OUR DESIRE ESPECIALLY

01:45:11.071 --> 01:45:12.706
DURING GET RID COMING OUT OF A

01:45:12.773 --> 01:45:14.274
CODEPENDENT MAKE THAT WE ARE

01:45:14.341 --> 01:45:16.109
FOCUSED ON THE PIPELINE GETTING

01:45:16.176 --> 01:45:19.513
FRONTLINE RESPONDERS OUT. IT'S

01:45:19.579 --> 01:45:20.647
IT SHOULD BE INTERPRETED BY

01:45:20.714 --> 01:45:22.382
NUMBER OF THE QUESTIONING FROM

01:45:22.449 --> 01:45:23.784
MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE THAT

01:45:23.850 --> 01:45:25.285
THAT IS NOT A GOOD SIGN. IF YOU

01:45:25.352 --> 01:45:26.520
LOOK AT A NUMBER OF THE OTHER

01:45:26.586 --> 01:45:27.621
BOARDS AND BUREAUS THAT HAVE

01:45:27.688 --> 01:45:29.322
COME BEFORE HE'S OVERSIGHT

01:45:29.389 --> 01:45:31.358
HEARINGS. MANY OF THEM GO

01:45:31.425 --> 01:45:33.527
SEAMLESS WITHOUT. MANY

01:45:33.593 --> 01:45:36.129
QUESTIONS. BUT THE TEMPTATION

01:45:36.196 --> 01:45:37.898
OF ALL OF THESE CHALLENGES AND

01:45:37.964 --> 01:45:40.000
QUESTIONS TO LEAVE YOU TO. THE

01:45:40.067 --> 01:45:41.468
CONCLUSION THAT THERE IS A LACK

01:45:41.535 --> 01:45:43.136
OF CONFIDENCE IN YOUR ABILITY

01:45:43.203 --> 01:45:45.172

01:45:45.238 --> 01:45:46.373
WELL AS THE BOARD. IT'S

01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:48.542
IMPERATIVE THEN THAT WE WILL DO

01:45:48.608 --> 01:45:49.876
WHAT WE NEED TO DO ON THE

01:45:49.943 --> 01:45:51.912
POLICY REVOCATIONS HELP EMPOWER

01:45:51.978 --> 01:45:53.013
YOU BECAUSE WHAT I'M HEARING

01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:54.981
YOU SAY. IS THAT YOU DO NOT

01:45:55.048 --> 01:45:56.616
HAVE THE AUTHORITY NOR ARE YOU

01:45:56.683 --> 01:45:58.952
SET UP FOR SUCCESS AND SO BY

01:45:59.019 --> 01:46:01.054
DEFAULT YOUR SET UP TO FAIL. IF

01:46:01.121 --> 01:46:03.123
THAT IS THE CASE THEN I WOULD

01:46:03.190 --> 01:46:04.858
ASK THAT YOU WORK WITH US IN

01:46:04.925 --> 01:46:06.493
THE LEGISLATIVE BODY TO HELP

01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:07.994
IMPLEMENT POLICIES SO THAT YOU

01:46:08.061 --> 01:46:09.563
STATUTORILY CAN BE SET UP FOR

01:46:09.629 --> 01:46:11.765
SUCCESS. BECAUSE IN MY HEART OF

01:46:11.832 --> 01:46:13.967
HEARTS I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT

01:46:14.034 --> 01:46:16.970
YOU WANT TO DO THE BEST THING

01:46:17.037 --> 01:46:17.537
YOU'RE DOING. AS MUCH AS YOU

01:46:17.604 --> 01:46:19.740
CAN. BUT IT IS ABUNDANTLY CLEAR

01:46:19.806 --> 01:46:23.744
THAT YOU ARE NOT- AND SO.

01:46:23.810 --> 01:46:25.479
THERE'S A DISCONNECT SO LET US

01:46:25.545 --> 01:46:28.415
TRY TO CONTINUE TO TAKE LOW

01:46:28.482 --> 01:46:29.950
LEVEL OF SERIOUSNESS IN THE

01:46:30.016 --> 01:46:31.084
SENSE OF URGENCY ON THESE

01:46:31.151 --> 01:46:33.086
ISSUES AND HELPING TO INSPIRE

01:46:33.153 --> 01:46:35.155
CONFIDENCE IN US AND NOT JUST

01:46:35.222 --> 01:46:38.091
BY CONVERSATION BUT INACTION A

01:46:38.158 --> 01:46:39.893
BECAUSE WE ARE BEHOLDEN TO THAT

01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:42.796
OF THE TAX PAYER AND MEMBERS OF

01:46:42.863 --> 01:46:43.563
THE PUBLIC AND WHEN WE HEAR

01:46:43.630 --> 01:46:45.966
FROM THE SCHOOLS ABOUT THESE

01:46:46.032 --> 01:46:48.935
ATROCITIES IT'S OUR JOB THAN TO

01:46:49.002 --> 01:46:49.870
HELP FOCUS AND ADDRESSING THE

01:46:49.936 --> 01:46:51.938
RED TAPE. AND NOT SEEING THE

01:46:52.005 --> 01:46:53.473
GROSS NEGLIGENCE THAT WE SEE IN

01:46:53.540 --> 01:46:55.776

THAT- I THINK- EXECUTIVE

01:48:54.527 --> 01:49:00.800
OFFICER- AND A TREMENDOUS JOB

01:49:00.867 --> 01:49:03.203
CONSIDERING WHAT SHE HAS TO

HER EFFORTS- SECONDLY. I THINK

01:49:22.088 --> 01:49:26.026
PART OF THE REASON WHY-

01:49:26.092 --> 01:49:27.827
EXECUTIVE OFFICER YAMAGUCHI IS

01:49:27.894 --> 01:49:30.263
HAVING- SUCH STRUGGLES IS THAT

01:49:30.330 --> 01:49:32.599
THERE IS NO FEE FOR THE

01:49:32.666 --> 01:49:34.901
ACCREDITATION PROCESS FOR THE

01:49:34.968 --> 01:49:38.738
FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS- THIS

01:49:38.805 --> 01:49:41.308
PROHIBITS HER FROM HIRING. MORE

01:49:41.374 --> 01:49:44.644
STAFF TO DIRECTLY- TRIAGE THIS

01:49:44.711 --> 01:49:48.949
BACKLOG OF SCHOOLS WAITING

01:49:49.015 --> 01:49:51.318
ACCREDITATION PROCESS. AND

01:49:51.384 --> 01:49:53.353
ADDITIONALLY YOU KNOW V. BOARD

01:49:55.722 --> 01:49:58.959
RIGHT NOW TO INCREASE THE FEES

01:49:59.025 --> 01:50:02.662
ON LICENSE FEES THAT HE IS

01:50:02.729 --> 01:50:06.299
SUBSIDIZING THE COST OF AND

01:50:06.366 --> 01:50:08.335
THEIR INSTITUTIONS TO GET

01:50:08.401 --> 01:50:12.272
ACCREDITED. SO NOT ONLY ARE-

01:50:12.339 --> 01:50:14.674
STUDENTS PAYING FOR TUITION

01:50:14.741 --> 01:50:17.677
THEY ARE THEN GOING THROUGH THE

SUBSIDIZING THE COST OF FOR

01:50:35.028 --> 01:50:37.130
PROFIT INSTITUTIONS I THINK

01:50:37.197 --> 01:50:38.698
SOMETHING COULD BE ESTABLISHED

01:50:38.765 --> 01:50:40.900

ARE USING THIS FOR OTHER

02:13:43.281 --> 02:13:45.150
PURPOSES. THEN HOW DO WE MAKE

02:13:45.217 --> 02:13:46.785
SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN

02:13:46.852 --> 02:13:49.221

WERE USED FOR COMPARATIVE

02:23:11.049 --> 02:23:13.985
ANALYSIS. SURE SO I MAY ARE

02:23:14.052 --> 02:23:15.086
PROBABLY AN INCH OR MORE

02:23:15.153 --> 02:23:16.754
SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THAT

ADDRESS BECAUSE- I'M FROM A BIG

02:23:19.590 --> 02:23:23.428
PICTURE PERSPECTIVE. UP THEY

02:23:23.494 --> 02:23:24.929
ARE A BIBLE C. THREE

02:23:24.996 --> 02:23:26.931
ORGANIZATION. AND THAT'S PART

02:23:26.998 --> 02:23:28.399
OF THAT THERE ARE SPECIFIC

02:23:28.466 --> 02:23:30.034
REQUIREMENTS FROM THE IRS IS

02:23:30.101 --> 02:23:31.769
BEING PART OF A BIBLE ONE TWO

02:23:31.836 --> 02:23:33.938

THE IRC. FORTY NINE FIFTY EIGHT

02:23:40.345 --> 02:23:40.745
THE FIELD INTERMEDIATE

02:23:40.812 --> 02:23:43.081
SANCTIONS- AND IS LESS THE

02:23:43.147 --> 02:23:45.049
SPECIFIC TYPES OF DATA THAT

02:23:45.116 --> 02:23:47.085
SHOULD BE USED. WHEN COMPARING

02:23:47.151 --> 02:23:49.120
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION IT

02:23:49.187 --> 02:23:51.589
SPECIFICALLY LAST OTHER BIBLE

02:23:51.656 --> 02:23:53.157
ONE SEE THREE- OR OTHER

02:23:53.224 --> 02:23:55.193
NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AS

02:23:55.259 --> 02:23:57.128
APPROPRIATE COMPARISONS AND SO

02:23:57.195 --> 02:23:59.230
IN ORDER TO BE IN COMPLIANCE

02:23:59.297 --> 02:24:02.266
WITH. FRANKLY IRS REQUIREMENTS

02:24:02.333 --> 02:24:03.101
WE WILL LOOK AT THOSE OTHER

02:24:03.167 --> 02:24:05.636
ORGANIZATIONS BUT- THAT'S THE

02:24:05.703 --> 02:24:06.904
COMPLIANCE WITH IDEA TO LET LET

02:24:06.971 --> 02:24:11.409
ME ASK. ANSWER FROM A MORE.

02:24:11.476 --> 02:24:13.478
MARK BASED- KA. ACROSS IN THAT

02:24:13.544 --> 02:24:15.046
IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT EXECUTIVE

02:24:15.113 --> 02:24:17.382
COMPENSATION YOU TEND TO SEE

02:24:17.448 --> 02:24:18.883
THE STRONGEST CORRELATION

02:24:18.950 --> 02:24:19.550
BETWEEN THE SIZE OF AN

02:24:19.617 --> 02:24:22.587
ORGANIZATION AND CEO OR

02:24:22.653 --> 02:24:24.756
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

02:24:24.822 --> 02:24:28.326
SO YOU'D EXPECT THE CEO OF A

02:24:28.393 --> 02:24:30.028
TEN BILLION COMPANY TO EARN

02:24:30.094 --> 02:24:31.529
MORE THAN THE CEO OF A TEN

02:24:31.596 --> 02:24:33.064
MILLION DOLLAR COMPANY ALL ELSE

02:24:33.131 --> 02:24:36.067
BEING EQUAL. AND SO AS WE

02:24:36.134 --> 02:24:37.802
IDENTIFIED THE CURES FOR

02:24:37.869 --> 02:24:39.971
COMPARISON OUR FOCUS WAS ON

02:24:40.038 --> 02:24:41.739
LOOKING AT OTHER NONPROFITS

02:24:41.806 --> 02:24:43.608

02:24:43.674 --> 02:24:45.376
WESTERN A CALIFORNIA BASED AS

02:24:45.443 --> 02:24:46.778
WE COULD FROM A GEOGRAPHIC

02:24:46.844 --> 02:24:49.180
PURPOSES REALLY THE FOCUS WAS

02:24:49.247 --> 02:24:50.381
ON BOTH SIDES OF THOSE

02:24:50.448 --> 02:24:52.683
ORGANIZATIONS BY LOOKING AT THE

02:24:52.750 --> 02:24:56.220
SIZE OF STAFF. TO SAY HEY THIS

02:24:56.287 --> 02:24:57.321
IS A LARGE ORGANIZATION ARE

02:24:57.388 --> 02:24:58.956
VERY ORGAN. HOW DO FIND THE

02:24:59.023 --> 02:25:02.026
MOST COMPARABLE- ORGANIZATIONS

02:25:02.093 --> 02:25:04.762
IN TERMS OF SIZE OR COMPARISON.

02:25:04.829 --> 02:25:06.230
BUT THAT WAS JUST ONE PIECE OF

02:25:06.297 --> 02:25:07.765
THE ANALYSIS THAT YOUR

02:25:07.832 --> 02:25:09.567
NONPROFIT ALSO WE LOOKED AT

02:25:09.634 --> 02:25:12.804

ALSO LOOKED AT PUBLISHED SALARY

02:25:15.006 --> 02:25:16.841
SURVEY DATA SO AS A FIRM WE

02:25:16.908 --> 02:25:18.109

COMPENSATION SALARY SURVEY DATA

02:25:21.012 --> 02:25:22.780
AND SO WE'RE ABLE TO LOOK LIKE

02:25:22.847 --> 02:25:24.682
INDUSTRY GEOGRAPHY AND SIZE OF

02:25:24.749 --> 02:25:28.753
ORGANIZATION I'M FROM PUBLISHED

WITH THAT I'VE BEEN TO MORE

02:25:32.490 --> 02:25:35.393

02:39:12.109 --> 02:39:14.278

02:39:41.305 --> 02:39:43.540
THE COUNCIL SEEMS TO WORK WHEN

02:39:43.607 --> 02:39:45.575
IT COMES TO THAT BUT- THERE ARE

02:39:45.642 --> 02:39:47.678
A COUPLE AREAS ACTUALLY SOME

02:39:47.744 --> 02:39:49.446
SIGNIFICANT AREAS WHERE I THINK

02:39:51.581 --> 02:39:53.717
FURTHER ATTENTION NEEDS TO BE

02:39:53.784 --> 02:39:55.919
DIRECTED IN THE FIRST. IS THE

02:39:55.986 --> 02:39:59.122
ISSUE OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING- I

02:39:59.189 --> 02:40:01.024

HERE IN THE ASSEMBLY. IS THAT-

02:40:10.500 --> 02:40:13.170
THE COUNCIL HAS DONE A LESS

02:40:13.236 --> 02:40:15.839
THAN SATISFACTORY JOB IN EITHER

02:40:15.906 --> 02:40:17.874
EXPLAINING ITS INTERFACE WITH

CONDUCTING INTERFACE WITH LAW

02:40:21.979 --> 02:40:24.414
ENFORCEMENT I UNDERSTAND THAT

02:40:24.481 --> 02:40:26.583
YOUR JOB IS TO PROVIDE

02:40:26.650 --> 02:40:28.518
VOLUNTARY CERTIFICATION OF

02:40:28.585 --> 02:40:31.321
THOSE MASSAGE THERAPIST TO

02:40:31.388 --> 02:40:31.922
CHOOSE TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF

02:40:31.989 --> 02:40:34.925
IT- BUT THERE'S A LARGER ISSUE

02:40:34.992 --> 02:40:37.094
HERE AND I DON'T THINK YOU CAN

02:40:37.160 --> 02:40:39.429
SIMPLY SAY WE JUST SORT OF FIVE

02:40:39.496 --> 02:40:43.433
A SIDE. THERAPISTS AND NOT DEAL

02:40:43.500 --> 02:40:45.602
WITH THE ISSUE OF WHAT GOES ON

02:40:45.669 --> 02:40:47.904
IN THE FACILITIES THAT YOU DO

02:40:47.971 --> 02:40:50.073
NOT CERTIFY BUT WHERE YOU'RE

02:40:50.140 --> 02:40:51.341
CERTIFIED MASSAGE THERAPIST

02:40:51.408 --> 02:40:54.311
WORK. AND SO I WOULD HOPE THAT

02:40:54.378 --> 02:40:55.345
THE NEXT TIME WE HAVE THIS

02:40:55.412 --> 02:40:57.914
CONVERSATION. THERE IS A MORE

02:40:57.981 --> 02:41:00.050
DETAILED EXPLANATION AND

02:41:00.117 --> 02:41:02.753
SPECIFIC EXPLANATION OF HOW THE

02:41:02.819 --> 02:41:05.122
COUNCIL IS WORKING WITH LOCAL

02:41:05.188 --> 02:41:08.258
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. WITH

02:41:08.325 --> 02:41:10.927
DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND FRANKLY

02:41:10.994 --> 02:41:12.662
WITH THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY

02:41:12.729 --> 02:41:15.365
GENERAL ALL OF WHOM HAVE A MUCH

02:41:15.432 --> 02:41:19.069
GREATER ROLE. IN SOME RESPECTS

02:41:19.136 --> 02:41:20.437
THEN THE COUNCIL DOES IN

02:41:20.504 --> 02:41:21.671
PUTTING A STOP TO HUMAN

02:41:21.738 --> 02:41:23.974
TRAFFICKING BUT YOU CANNOT SAY

02:41:24.041 --> 02:41:26.109
ALL WE DO IS CERTIFIED MASSAGE

02:41:26.176 --> 02:41:28.245
THERAPISTS AND LEAVE IT AT THAT

02:41:28.311 --> 02:41:29.446
AND THE EXPLANATION THAT WAS

02:41:29.513 --> 02:41:30.914
PROVIDED TO SOME VERY SPECIFIC

02:41:30.981 --> 02:41:33.316
QUESTIONS. ASKING A VARIETY

02:41:33.383 --> 02:41:35.352
WAYS WAS PRETTY GENERAL AS FAR

02:41:35.419 --> 02:41:37.187
AS I'M CONCERNED AND I WANT

02:41:37.254 --> 02:41:38.655
MORE DETAIL AND I SUSPECT MY

02:41:38.722 --> 02:41:42.659
COLLEAGUES TO OR- THERE MAY BE

02:41:42.726 --> 02:41:44.528
A CHANGE IN THE WAY WE DEAL

02:41:44.594 --> 02:41:46.797
WITH MASSAGE THERAPIST AS AN

02:41:46.863 --> 02:41:48.665
OCCUPATION IN THE STATE. NOW

02:41:48.732 --> 02:41:50.133
WHAT MY COLLEAGUES MAY OR MAY

02:41:50.200 --> 02:41:53.003
NOT REALIZE IS. IF WE CREATE A

02:41:53.070 --> 02:41:55.639
LICENSING SITUATION THAT'S NOT

02:41:55.705 --> 02:41:59.276
GOING TO END HUMAN TRAFFICKING.

02:41:59.342 --> 02:42:01.711
IT STILL REQUIRES ACTIVITY BY

02:42:01.778 --> 02:42:03.580
THE LICENSING AGENCY BY THE

02:42:03.647 --> 02:42:05.415
DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S BY THE

02:42:05.482 --> 02:42:07.284
COUNTY SURE SENT BY THE LOCAL

02:42:07.350 --> 02:42:08.852
POLICE CHIEFS TO PUT A STOP TO

02:42:08.919 --> 02:42:10.720
IT BUT I'D I'D EXPECT MORE

02:42:10.787 --> 02:42:12.923
EXPLANATION AND I CERTAINLY

02:42:12.989 --> 02:42:13.523
EXPECT THAT THE NEXT TIME WE

02:42:13.590 --> 02:42:15.125
DEAL WITH THIS. OTHER SECOND

02:42:15.192 --> 02:42:16.293
ISSUE THAT I THINK YOU NEED TO

02:42:16.359 --> 02:42:18.261
GIVE SOME THOUGHT TO IS

02:42:18.328 --> 02:42:20.230
INCREASED PARTICIPATION BY A

02:42:20.297 --> 02:42:22.332
MASSAGE PROFESSIONALS AND BY

02:42:22.399 --> 02:42:22.933
DISINTERESTED MEMBERS OF THE

02:42:22.999 --> 02:42:26.136
PUBLIC. ON YOUR BOARD I THINK

02:42:26.203 --> 02:42:28.438
TO HAVE ADDITIONAL AND ALSO TO

02:42:28.505 --> 02:42:31.241
PROVIDE FOR SPECIFIC TERMS AND

02:42:31.308 --> 02:42:32.542
FOR A MORE DEFINITE APPOINTMENT

02:42:32.609 --> 02:42:34.044
PROCESS FOR YOUR BOARD OF

02:42:34.111 --> 02:42:35.946
DIRECTORS BECAUSE I THINK THAT

02:42:36.012 --> 02:42:37.647
MAY ADDRESS SOME OF THE- THE

02:42:37.714 --> 02:42:39.749
COMPENSATION CONCERNS RAISED BY

02:42:39.816 --> 02:42:42.586

HUNDRED AND OF US AT A HUNDRED

02:42:43.620 --> 02:42:44.888
AND SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WAS

02:42:44.955 --> 02:42:47.090
CITED FOR A GOVERNMENT STATE

02:42:47.157 --> 02:42:48.592
EMPLOYER RUNNING ONE OF THESE

02:42:48.658 --> 02:42:52.129
BOARDS THAT IS REGULATED BY THE

02:42:52.195 --> 02:42:53.063
DCA AND OF COURSE. AS YOUR

02:42:53.130 --> 02:42:55.432
COMPENSATION. POINTED OUT THAT

02:42:55.499 --> 02:42:56.900

02:42:56.967 --> 02:42:58.301
VERY VERY GENEROUS

02:42:58.368 --> 02:43:00.403

THAT- BASED COMPENSATION AND IT

02:43:08.111 --> 02:43:09.880
