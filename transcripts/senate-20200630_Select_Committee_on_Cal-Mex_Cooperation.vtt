00:40:18.716 --> 00:40:20.251
INCREASE IN SOUTHBOUND TRAFFIC

00:40:20.317 --> 00:40:22.286
AS OF LATE TRAVELING BACK INTO

00:40:22.353 --> 00:40:25.122
MEXICO- WHICH LIKELY IS A

00:40:25.189 --> 00:40:27.792
RELATED TO- SCREENING THAT THEY

00:40:27.858 --> 00:40:30.027
MAY BE DOING- AS FOLKS ARE

00:40:30.094 --> 00:40:31.529
HEADED BACK INTO MEXICO BUT-

00:40:31.595 --> 00:40:33.164
CERTAINLY THERE'S A NUMBER OF.

00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:36.400
FACTORS WITH THE RELATIONSHIP

00:40:36.467 --> 00:40:37.835
BETWEEN IMPERIAL COUNTY IN

00:40:37.902 --> 00:40:39.904

TO LOOK INTO THAT BECAUSE THAT

00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:55.186
COULD BE A SOURCE OF INCREASE

00:40:55.252 --> 00:40:58.756
INFECTIONS AND. AND TO OPEN UP

00:40:58.823 --> 00:41:00.324
A LINE OF COMMUNICATION WITH

BRING US TOGETHER- ACTUALLY

00:41:27.284 --> 00:41:28.285
IT'S QUITE APROPOS WE'RE HAVING

00:41:28.352 --> 00:41:30.287
THIS HEARING TODAY BECAUSE-

00:41:30.354 --> 00:41:31.956
AND- FORTUNATELY I THINK SOME

00:41:32.022 --> 00:41:33.357
STATES AT THE NEW YORK ADDS TO

00:41:33.424 --> 00:41:35.359
CLEAR DO WANT TO- SENSUALLY

00:41:35.426 --> 00:41:36.760
ISOLATE- PEOPLE COMING

00:41:36.827 --> 00:41:38.095
TRAVELING FROM CALIFORNIA TO

00:41:38.162 --> 00:41:39.330
THE STATE FOR FOURTEEN DAYS

00:41:39.396 --> 00:41:42.766
WHEN THEY SHOW UP- BUT- AND

00:41:42.833 --> 00:41:43.767
SANDERS OF. SOME DISCUSSION

00:41:43.834 --> 00:41:47.438
ABOUT THAT- BUT I THINK ALSO AS

00:41:47.504 --> 00:41:48.839
EVEN WHEN THIS PANDEMIC WAS

00:41:48.906 --> 00:41:51.675
SPREADING- THERE'S SOME

00:41:51.742 --> 00:41:53.344
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER. SUCH

00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:56.313
ACTIVITY SUCH EFFORTS ARE-

00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:58.215
REALLY SUCCESSFUL IN TRYING TO

00:41:58.282 --> 00:42:00.184
LIMIT THE SPREAD OF THE-

00:42:00.251 --> 00:42:00.951
PANDEMIC THE SPREAD AROUND THE

00:42:01.018 --> 00:42:02.753
WORLD BUT- WHEN THE THINGS THAT

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:05.055
IS EFFECTIVE IS ACTUALLY-

00:42:05.122 --> 00:42:06.457
EVENTUALLY BE ABLE TO MOVE TO A

00:42:06.523 --> 00:42:08.359
CONTAINMENT STRATEGY IN TERMS

00:42:08.425 --> 00:42:09.526
OF SIZE. THE ONLY INCREASING

00:42:09.593 --> 00:42:11.328
OUR TESTING BUT THEN DOING

00:42:11.395 --> 00:42:13.130
CONTACT TRACING AND THEN

00:42:13.197 --> 00:42:14.698
ISOLATING PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:42:14.765 --> 00:42:18.168
POSITIVE WITH THE DISEASE. SO I

00:42:18.235 --> 00:42:20.304
GUESS MY QUESTION IS ABOUT-

00:42:20.371 --> 00:42:22.406
THAT CROSS THE BORDER THAT WE

00:42:22.473 --> 00:42:24.308
HAVE BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND

00:42:24.375 --> 00:42:26.410
MEXICO. WHAT THEIR DAUGHTERS

00:42:26.477 --> 00:42:28.245
SOME DISCUSSIONS GOING ON

00:42:28.312 --> 00:42:30.781
BETWEEN OUR PUBLIC HEALTH- HERE

00:42:30.848 --> 00:42:33.617
IN CALIFORNIA AND IN A CO ABOUT

00:42:33.684 --> 00:42:36.921
COOPERATING AND DOING- TESTING

00:42:36.987 --> 00:42:38.656
TRACING IN ISOLATION OF PEOPLE

00:42:38.722 --> 00:42:40.824
WHO ARE POSITIVE WHEN WE GET TO

00:42:40.891 --> 00:42:42.793
THE POINT WHERE WE HAVE- CAN

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:46.030
MANAGE THAT AND- SO IN TERMS OF

00:42:46.096 --> 00:42:47.131
BECAUSE KNOWING THAT PEOPLE

00:42:47.197 --> 00:42:48.399
GOING ACROSS THE BORDER FOR

00:42:48.465 --> 00:42:49.767
MANY DIFFERENT REASONS SUMMER

00:42:49.833 --> 00:42:51.568
SENT TO WORKERS SOME BECAUSE OF

00:42:51.635 --> 00:42:53.971
TRADE AND OTHER THINGS- WHAT

00:42:54.038 --> 00:42:55.272
SORT OF COOPERATIVE PUBLIC

00:42:55.339 --> 00:42:58.475
HEALTH- NON. ARRANGEMENTS ARE

00:42:58.542 --> 00:43:00.477
BEING DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF

BEING ABLE TO. DO TESTING

00:43:03.013 --> 00:43:05.849
TRACING OF PEOPLE TO HELP

00:43:05.916 --> 00:43:08.252
BETTER CONTAIN ALBERY THAT MAY

00:43:08.319 --> 00:43:09.153
BE HAPPENING IS PEOPLE ARE

00:43:09.219 --> 00:43:10.454
COMING BACK AND FORTH ACROSS

00:43:10.521 --> 00:43:15.793
THE BORDER. SO WE ARE IN

00:43:15.859 --> 00:43:17.594
CONVERSATIONS WITH PUBLIC HELP

00:43:17.661 --> 00:43:18.929
ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER

00:43:18.996 --> 00:43:21.899
EVERY DAY- I THINK THAT THAT

00:43:21.966 --> 00:43:23.267
CONTAINMENT STRATEGIES HAVE

00:43:23.334 --> 00:43:24.868
LARGELY BEEN ON THIS SIDE OF

00:43:24.935 --> 00:43:25.703
THE BORDER WE'RE WORKING WITH

00:43:25.769 --> 00:43:28.872
CDC TO PROVIDE RESOURCES I KNOW

00:43:28.939 --> 00:43:30.741
SAN DIEGO HAS PROVIDED SOME.

00:43:30.808 --> 00:43:32.876
TESTING AND CON AND SB

00:43:32.943 --> 00:43:35.512

I'M AND MORE WORK TO BE DONE

00:43:37.648 --> 00:43:39.216
FOR SURE- I THINK BAFFERT'S

STARTED PLAN MORE ON. IT'S EASY

01:16:15.203 --> 01:16:16.605
TO ADD NEW SPACE IS MORE

01:16:16.672 --> 01:16:18.573
DIFFICULT TO ADD STAFF AND

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:20.509

NEEDS TO HAPPEN TO BE ABLE TO

01:16:31.553 --> 01:16:36.792
CREATE THAT. WE SHOULD STAND UP

01:16:36.858 --> 01:16:38.660
THE FACILITIES FIRST AND THAT

01:16:38.727 --> 01:16:40.796
COMES WITH STAFFING AS FAR AS

01:16:40.862 --> 01:16:44.333
LOW SHORT TERM FUTURE OF CHANGE.

01:16:44.399 --> 01:16:45.534
I TO GO CHANGES THE DIFFICULT

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:47.402

01:20:27.923 --> 01:20:29.457
FINAL FOR THE CONCLUSION HERE I

01:20:29.524 --> 01:20:30.892

THAT THESE FACILITIES ARE RUN

02:31:11.262 --> 02:31:13.697
BY FOR PROFIT CONTRACTORS WHO

02:31:13.764 --> 02:31:16.934
