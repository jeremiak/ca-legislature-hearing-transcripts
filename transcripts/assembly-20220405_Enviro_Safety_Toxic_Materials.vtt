WHAT THE LARGEST TRADE SHOW IN

THE COUNTRY AND THE WE HAVE. AN

00:53:10.153 --> 00:53:11.521
EVENT WHERE MANY INNOVATORS HAVE

00:53:11.588 --> 00:53:12.856
PRODUCED PRODUCTS USED IN OUR

00:53:12.923 --> 00:53:15.392

00:53:15.458 --> 00:53:17.360
A LOT OF INNOVATION THERE. MY

00:53:17.427 --> 00:53:19.563
COMMENTS ARE GONNA FOCUS ON

00:53:19.629 --> 00:53:21.364
BATTERY INVENTED PRODUCTS- ONE

00:53:21.431 --> 00:53:23.233
OF THE THINGS WE LEARNED-

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:24.801
SPECIFICALLY ON BATTERY

00:53:24.868 --> 00:53:28.271
COLLECTION PROGRAMS- THE BEST-

00:53:28.338 --> 00:53:29.873
MOST IMPORTANT PROGRAM ELEMENT

00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:31.174
FOR DIVERTING BATTERIES TO

00:53:31.241 --> 00:53:32.309
PROPER RECYCLING IS BETTER

00:53:32.375 --> 00:53:35.078
PUBLIC EDUCATION- SO WE'RE

00:53:35.145 --> 00:53:38.481
REALLY NOT ADDRESSING. BATTERY

00:53:38.548 --> 00:53:40.216
PORTIONS OF THE BILL. ALTHOUGH I

00:53:40.283 --> 00:53:41.184
DO APPRECIATE SOME OF THE

00:53:41.251 --> 00:53:45.088
DETAILS ARE STILL BEING WORKED

00:53:45.155 --> 00:53:46.723
OUT THERE TO. PROBLEM THAT WE

00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:47.824
HAVE WITH BATTERY IN PLAN AS

00:53:47.891 --> 00:53:49.659
THEY VERY NEEDS THAN BLUE

00:53:49.726 --> 00:53:50.894
SPATTER. THAT NEED TO BE CALLED-

00:53:50.961 --> 00:53:54.064
FIRST. BATTERIES ARE IN THEY'RE

00:53:54.130 --> 00:53:55.699
INVISIBLE TO CONSUMERS AND

00:53:55.765 --> 00:53:57.968
THEREFORE- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A

00:53:58.034 --> 00:53:59.869
COLLECTION SYSTEM THAT WILL NOT

00:53:59.936 --> 00:54:01.571
BE INTUITIVE BUT TO CONSUMERS

00:54:01.638 --> 00:54:03.039
THERE ARE A LOT OF PRODUCTS THAT

00:54:03.106 --> 00:54:05.075
HAVE BEEN BETTER BATTERIES. THAT

00:54:05.141 --> 00:54:06.109
MAY HAVE BEEN BETTER BATTERIES

00:54:06.176 --> 00:54:07.644
OR MAY NOT YOU KNOW LIKE

00:54:07.711 --> 00:54:09.112
HEADPHONES OR EAR BUDS

00:54:09.179 --> 00:54:11.414
SMARTPHONE CASES PORTABLE

00:54:11.481 --> 00:54:14.417
PRINTERS WATCHES- LOTS OF SMALL

00:54:14.484 --> 00:54:17.420
APPLIANCES. THERE REALLY IS-

00:54:17.487 --> 00:54:19.189
IT'S REALLY A MODEL BY MODEL IN

00:54:19.255 --> 00:54:21.391
SOME CASES DETERMINATION WHETHER

00:54:21.458 --> 00:54:22.926
OR NOT THERE'S A BATTERY IN

00:54:22.993 --> 00:54:24.694
BETTER THAN US AND WE WERE VERY

00:54:24.761 --> 00:54:26.997
CONCERNED THAT THE WAY THIS IS

00:54:27.063 --> 00:54:28.531
STRUCTURED THAT WOULD NOT BE

00:54:28.598 --> 00:54:30.333
INTO TO CONSUMERS AND RETAILERS.

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:31.101

01:02:05.021 --> 01:02:07.523
FOR COLLECTION SITES YES AN

01:02:07.590 --> 01:02:08.724
EXEMPTION FOR. IT IS THE ID

01:02:08.791 --> 01:02:11.260
NUMBER FIVE YEAH IT'S FIVE ONE

01:02:11.327 --> 01:02:13.663
MILLIONS OF UNDER FIVE LOCATIONS

01:02:13.729 --> 01:02:17.467
YET AND STATE OKAY THANK YOU.

JUST QUICKLY SOME OF THE ISSUES

01:02:25.508 --> 01:02:28.744
OF THE STAKEHOLDERS OBVIOUSLY

01:02:28.811 --> 01:02:30.346
THE WHAT WE HAVE FOR RECYCLING

01:02:30.413 --> 01:02:32.415
RIGHT NOW IS A BATTERY RECYCLING

01:02:32.482 --> 01:02:35.751
IS NOT SUFFICIENT AND THIS IS A

01:02:35.818 --> 01:02:37.653
CRUCIAL ISSUE THAT WE HAVE TO

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:39.455
DEAL WITH ONE OF THE REASONS

01:02:39.522 --> 01:02:40.756
THAT YOU KNOW THERE THERE ARE

01:02:40.823 --> 01:02:42.058
IT'S TWO SEPARATE IF YOU ARE

01:02:42.125 --> 01:02:43.893
PROGRAM SO YOU HEARD A LOT OF

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:44.994
THE- OPPOSITION MENTIONED THE

01:02:45.061 --> 01:02:46.929
CONCERN ABOUT EMBEDDED BATTERIES

01:02:46.996 --> 01:02:48.131
BUT THEY ALMOST WENT ALONG THEIR

01:02:48.197 --> 01:02:49.499
OWN ARGUMENT WHEN THEY STARTED

01:02:49.565 --> 01:02:51.267
ALONG THE LIST OF WELDERS

01:02:51.334 --> 01:02:53.736
CELLPHONES AND THERE'S WATCHES

01:02:53.803 --> 01:02:55.238
AND THERE'S THIS AND THERE'S

01:02:55.304 --> 01:02:56.139
THAT AND THAT'S EXACTLY THE

01:02:56.205 --> 01:02:57.940
PROBLEM SO IT IS. REALLY

01:02:58.007 --> 01:02:59.542
CRITICAL THAT WE DEAL WITH NOT

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:01.144
ONLY THE EMBEDDED ISSUE WHICH

01:03:01.210 --> 01:03:04.413
WILL BE SEPARATE FROM THE LOOSE

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:07.850
BATTERIES AND I WOULD I WOULD

01:03:07.917 --> 01:03:09.819
LIKE TO MISTER SMELLS ARE TO SEE

01:03:09.886 --> 01:03:11.721
IF HE HAS ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD

01:03:11.787 --> 01:03:14.023
ON TO THAT BUT I JUST I JUST

01:03:14.090 --> 01:03:16.759
WANT TO SAY NO EVEN I GUESS GOOD

01:03:16.826 --> 01:03:18.027
MISTER GOVERNOR AS A

01:03:18.094 --> 01:03:18.995
REPRESENTATIVE OF SOMEBODY THAT

01:03:19.061 --> 01:03:22.698
HAS IT. FOUR YEARS WE ARE REALLY

01:03:22.765 --> 01:03:24.467
COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH EVERY

01:03:24.534 --> 01:03:28.004
SINGLE STAKEHOLDER AND- I HEARD.

01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:30.173
ONE OF THE- ONE OF THE SPEAKERS

01:03:30.239 --> 01:03:32.475
TALK ABOUT EDUCATION. EDUCATION

01:03:32.542 --> 01:03:34.810
IS THE BOTTOM LINE THE MOST THE

01:03:34.877 --> 01:03:37.013
MOST CRITICAL PART OF IT WE

01:03:37.079 --> 01:03:37.680
CANNOT BE SUCCESSFUL UNTIL

01:03:37.747 --> 01:03:40.016
EVERYBODY KNOWS EXACTLY. WHERE

01:03:40.082 --> 01:03:43.252
WHEN THEY'RE VAPING PEN IS OF IT

01:03:43.319 --> 01:03:45.988
IS IT IS COMPOSED. THE HEAD WE

01:03:46.055 --> 01:03:47.924
THAT THAT THAT THEY PUT IT IN A

01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:49.192
SAFE SPOT SO IT'S NOT BECAUSE

01:03:49.258 --> 01:03:50.927
THEY'RE IT CAUSING FIRES IN OUR

01:03:50.993 --> 01:03:51.994
RECYCLING. FACILITIES AND

01:03:52.061 --> 01:03:53.362
POLLUTING OUR ENVIRONMENT SO I

01:03:53.429 --> 01:03:55.364
THINK THAT YOU HAD A COUPLE OF

01:03:55.431 --> 01:03:57.433
COMMENTS ON SOME OF THE

01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:58.067
OPPOSITION BEYOND THAT. YEAH I

01:03:58.134 --> 01:03:58.868
MEAN I WOULD JUST I WOULD JUST

01:03:58.935 --> 01:04:00.403
OBSERVE I THINK- HISTORICALLY

01:04:00.469 --> 01:04:03.139
THESE PROGRAMS WORK BEST- WHEN

01:04:03.206 --> 01:04:04.173
THERE'S A NEGOTIATED COMPROMISE

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:05.841
IN THE GUEST BE TWO ONE TWO

01:04:05.908 --> 01:04:08.010
AGAIN TO GO BACK. THAT IS REALLY

01:04:08.077 --> 01:04:08.945
MAYBE THAT'S- WHERE WE'RE TRYING

01:04:09.011 --> 01:04:10.646
TO FOLLOW THAT SAME. PATH HERE

01:04:10.713 --> 01:04:12.114
WE'RE TRYING TO WORK WITH FOLKS

01:04:12.181 --> 01:04:14.050
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE

01:04:14.116 --> 01:04:14.951
THAT FOR THE FOLKS WHO ARE

01:04:15.017 --> 01:04:16.819

01:04:16.886 --> 01:04:18.821
SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY

01:04:18.888 --> 01:04:19.455
BUY INTO- SO THAT'S CERTAINLY

01:04:19.522 --> 01:04:20.823

PROHIBIT THE INCLUSION OF P.

FOSS CHEMICALS IN PERSONAL CARE

01:05:49.445 --> 01:05:50.980
PRODUCTS SO THOSE ARE THINGS

01:05:51.047 --> 01:05:52.982
LIKE LIPSTICK AND FACE CREAM AND

01:05:53.049 --> 01:05:54.250
OTHER THINGS THAT WE DON'T WANT

01:05:54.317 --> 01:05:56.686
TO HAVE THIS IN THE CLASS OF

01:05:56.752 --> 01:05:57.653
CHEMICALS KNOWN AS OUR I CAN'T

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:58.921
PRONOUNCE IT. THE P. FOSS ARE A

01:05:58.988 --> 01:06:00.623
LARGE FAMILY OF CHEMICALS KNOWN

01:06:00.690 --> 01:06:01.957
FOR THEIR LONG LASTING WATER AND

01:06:02.024 --> 01:06:03.492
OIL RESISTANT AND TEMPERATURE

01:06:03.559 --> 01:06:05.361
RETAINING PROPERTIES HOWEVER

01:06:05.428 --> 01:06:06.929
THESE PRODUCTS SHED P. PASSED

01:06:06.996 --> 01:06:08.664
CHEMICALS OVERTIME AND EXPOSE

01:06:08.731 --> 01:06:10.366
PEOPLE O THE CHEMICALS. PFOS

01:06:10.433 --> 01:06:11.834
CHEMICALS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO

01:06:11.901 --> 01:06:13.069
HAVE ADVERSE IMPACTS ON HUMAN

01:06:13.135 --> 01:06:15.037
HEALTH INCLUDING ON CHILDREN AND

01:06:15.104 --> 01:06:16.205
IS SOMEONE WHOSE EIGHT YEAR OLD

01:06:16.272 --> 01:06:17.740
IS GETTING INTO HER MAKE UP

01:06:17.807 --> 01:06:19.709
PRETTY MUCH ON A DAILY BASIS IT

01:06:19.775 --> 01:06:21.210
IS A CONCERN TO ME PERSONALLY.

01:06:21.277 --> 01:06:22.244
RECENT TESTING SHOWS THAT

01:06:22.311 --> 01:06:24.313
MANUFACTURERS INTENTIONALLY ADD

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:25.581
P. FOSTER PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS

01:06:25.648 --> 01:06:27.616
SUCH AS LIPSTICK MASCARA AND

01:06:27.683 --> 01:06:29.719
SHAVING CREAM SO YOU MEN ARE NOT

01:06:29.785 --> 01:06:31.354
IMMUNE. SINCE THE P. FAST

01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:32.655
CHEMICALS ARE NOT ESSENTIAL FOR

01:06:32.722 --> 01:06:33.856
THESE PRODUCTS TO BE USED AN

01:06:33.923 --> 01:06:36.659
ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS WITHOUT P.

01:06:36.726 --> 01:06:38.627
FAUCETS ARE AVAILABLE PEOPLE ARE

01:06:38.694 --> 01:06:40.363
EXPOSED. LITTLE REASON. A

01:06:40.429 --> 01:06:41.897
RESTRICTION ON THE KILLER CARE

01:06:41.964 --> 01:06:43.165
AT THE SALE OF PERSONAL CARE

01:06:43.232 --> 01:06:45.101
PRODUCTS CONTAINING P. FOSS. IS

01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:46.235
REALLY THE ONLY WAY TO ENSURE

01:06:46.302 --> 01:06:47.903
THAT EVERY CALIFORNIA'S ACCESS

01:06:47.970 --> 01:06:49.338
TO PRODUCTS THAT DO NOT PRESENT

01:06:49.405 --> 01:06:51.107
A HEALTH RISK TO THEIR FAMILIES.

01:06:51.173 --> 01:06:52.675
JUST BY THEIR MERE PRSENCE IN

01:06:52.742 --> 01:06:54.910
THEIR HOME. AND I WANT TO SAY

01:06:54.977 --> 01:06:55.945
THIS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S

01:06:56.011 --> 01:06:57.113
IMPORTANT THAT I DID NOT

01:06:57.179 --> 01:06:58.214
INTRODUCED THIS BILL. UNTIL I

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:00.383
FIRST REACHED OUT TO INDUSTRY.

01:07:00.449 --> 01:07:02.051
AND ASK THEM IF THEY WOULD BE

01:07:02.118 --> 01:07:04.019
WILLING TO ENGAGE IN THE EFFORT

01:07:04.086 --> 01:07:05.287
TO BAN P. FAUCETS AND PERSONAL

01:07:05.354 --> 01:07:07.957
CARE PRODUCTS. AND THEY ARE ALL

01:07:08.023 --> 01:07:10.025
CHOSE TO WORK WITH US ON THIS

01:07:10.092 --> 01:07:11.794
BILL ONE TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY

01:07:11.861 --> 01:07:14.430
ONE AND I WANT TO THANK THEM FOR

01:07:14.497 --> 01:07:15.231
THAT. AND I WILL CONTINUE TO

01:07:15.297 --> 01:07:16.732
MEET AND WORK WITH THEM.

01:07:16.799 --> 01:07:18.601
REGARDING WE AMEND THIS BILL TO

01:07:18.667 --> 01:07:20.002
ALLOW FOR SOME UNINTENTIONAL

01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:22.004
CONTAMINATION OF PRODUCTS. THIS

01:07:22.071 --> 01:07:23.672
IS A TOUGH ISSUE BECAUSE PEOPLE

01:07:23.739 --> 01:07:25.608
ARE SUPERIOR IN MANY PRODUCTS.

01:07:25.674 --> 01:07:27.710
AT THAT DON'T HAVE P. FAUCETS ON

01:07:27.777 --> 01:07:29.278
THE INGREDIENT LABEL. SO EVEN IF

01:07:29.345 --> 01:07:30.913
YOU WERE TRYING TO SCREEN THEM

01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:33.048
OUT IN YOUR HOME IT WILL BE VERY

01:07:33.115 --> 01:07:35.217
VERY HARD TO. AND THEY MIGHT

01:07:35.284 --> 01:07:35.818
EVEN HAVE VERY HIGH LEVELS OF

01:07:35.885 --> 01:07:38.387
PEOPLE PAST. AND I ALSO WANT TO

01:07:38.454 --> 01:07:39.054
SAY THAT AS SOMEONE WHO WAS ON

01:07:39.121 --> 01:07:41.090
OF WATER BOARD FOR ALMOST EIGHT

01:07:41.157 --> 01:07:41.891
YEARS. FOSSE'S ARE ALSO A REAL

01:07:41.957 --> 01:07:43.692
EMERGING. CONTAMINANT OF CONCERN

01:07:43.759 --> 01:07:45.261
BECAUSE THE LEECH OFF OF THESE

01:07:45.327 --> 01:07:47.763
PRODUCTS WHEN YOU WASH YOUR

01:07:47.830 --> 01:07:50.332
FACE. AND GO INTO THE WATER

01:07:50.399 --> 01:07:52.568
SUPPLY AND RIGHT NOW THE

01:07:52.635 --> 01:07:53.636
EATABLE. I TO GET OUT OF WILL.

01:07:53.702 --> 01:07:54.937
AT THEIR- CUSTOMERS AND WHY

01:07:55.004 --> 01:07:56.005
DON'T WANT TO BE DRINKING THE

01:07:56.071 --> 01:07:57.440
STUFF. AND REALLY WE HAVEN'T

01:07:57.506 --> 01:07:59.008
BEEN ABLE TO GET A HANDLE ON IT.

01:07:59.074 --> 01:08:00.643
NOW P. FAUCETS CANNELLA

01:08:00.709 --> 01:08:01.410
FUNCTIONALLY FUNCTIONAL USE A

01:08:01.477 --> 01:08:03.345
VERY LOW LEVEL SOME COSMETICS.

01:08:03.412 --> 01:08:04.747
FOR EXAMPLE THEY CAN BE

01:08:04.814 --> 01:08:05.514
INTENTIONALLY ATTITUDE

INGREDIENT- INTO A COSMETIC

01:08:08.317 --> 01:08:10.019
THEN. AND THEN THE P. FOSS MY

01:08:10.085 --> 01:08:12.121
ONLY JOB IS A VERY TRACE AMOUNT

01:08:12.188 --> 01:08:13.956

A HIGH POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN

KNOW IT SOUNDS LIKE EVERYBODY

01:23:51.326 --> 01:23:52.293
INCLUDING OPPOSITION FOR THOSE

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:54.095
THAT WE HEARD FROM TODAY AGREE

01:23:54.162 --> 01:23:55.663
THAT- MORE P. FAST COULD BE

01:23:55.730 --> 01:23:57.565
REMOVED FROM THE LIST THAT WE

01:23:57.632 --> 01:24:00.402
PASSED UNDER MEROM STRATEGY

01:24:00.468 --> 01:24:01.669
FELL. IN A RIVER HAVE YEARS AGO

01:24:01.736 --> 01:24:02.937
I WAS- BUT I GUESS I'M A LITTLE

01:24:03.004 --> 01:24:04.939
BIT. I'M JUST CURIOUS WHY THIS

01:24:05.006 --> 01:24:06.708
BILL ISN'T SORT OF USING THE

01:24:06.775 --> 01:24:08.410
SAME FRAMEWORK AND JUST ADDING

01:24:08.476 --> 01:24:10.278
THOSE P. FAST TO MR MERCER TWO

01:24:10.345 --> 01:24:11.246
THREE MARKETING WORK FOR TWO

01:24:11.312 --> 01:24:14.282
YEARS ON I THINK. WE GOT TO A

01:24:14.349 --> 01:24:16.818
REALLY GOOD PLACE. WELL BECAUSE-

01:24:16.885 --> 01:24:17.852
THERE'S A WHOLE RANGE OF THESE

01:24:17.919 --> 01:24:19.654
PRODUCTS AND WHAT SOMETIMES

01:24:19.721 --> 01:24:22.056
HAPPENS IS THAT THE FORMULA A-

01:24:22.123 --> 01:24:24.092
BILL CHANGE A LITTLE BIT OF THE

01:24:24.159 --> 01:24:24.659
FORMULATION BUT ESSENTIALLY

01:24:24.726 --> 01:24:25.794
YOU'RE STILL DOING. THE FAUCET.

01:24:25.860 --> 01:24:27.395
SO IT'S BETTER TO WHAT IT COMES

01:24:27.462 --> 01:24:28.863
TO LARGE CLASSES OF CHEMICALS

01:24:28.930 --> 01:24:30.632
LIKE THIS TO ADDRESS THEM AS A

01:24:30.698 --> 01:24:32.167
CLASS. BECAUSE IT DOESN'T TAKE

01:24:32.233 --> 01:24:33.735
MUCH FOR THEM TO TWEAK IT AND

01:24:33.802 --> 01:24:36.037
ALL OF A SUDDEN IT'S ON THE LIST

01:24:36.104 --> 01:24:37.172
HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS WHOLE

01:24:37.238 --> 01:24:39.073
LONG PROCESS AGAIN. OKAY THAT'S

01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:40.775
THAT'S WHY IT HASN'T WORKED TO

01:24:40.842 --> 01:24:42.177
DO IT SORT OF ONE BY ONE. SO

01:24:42.243 --> 01:24:43.778
COULD WE HAVE THE WHOLE CLASS OF

01:24:43.845 --> 01:24:45.246
P. FIVE TO THE FRAMEWORK CREATED

01:24:45.313 --> 01:24:46.948
BY THE- I. WHATEVER THE NUMBER

01:24:47.015 --> 01:24:48.650
WITH A CUSTOMER SEARCHES FELL

01:24:48.716 --> 01:24:49.217
TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY SIX YOU

01:24:49.284 --> 01:24:50.718
KNOW I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT

01:24:50.785 --> 01:24:52.887
THAT BILL TO KNOW HOW MUCH OF IT

01:24:52.954 --> 01:24:53.888
IS A LINE- BUT THAT'S

01:24:53.955 --> 01:24:55.723
ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'RE DOING IS

01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:56.791
WE'RE TRYING TO ADD TO. THE

01:24:56.858 --> 01:24:57.992
CLASS OF CHEMICALS BECAUSE RIGHT

01:24:58.059 --> 01:24:59.894
NOW EVEN AFTER THAT THE OLDER

01:24:59.961 --> 01:25:00.829
STILL. RIGHT WAY TOO MUCH OF

01:25:00.895 --> 01:25:02.664
THIS IN THE PRODUCTS AND IT'S

01:25:02.730 --> 01:25:04.632
STILL GETTING INTO THE WATER. SO

01:25:04.699 --> 01:25:06.167
WE FEEL THAT WE NEED TO HAVE AN

01:25:06.234 --> 01:25:08.236
YOU KNOW ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION

01:25:08.303 --> 01:25:09.170
TO REALLY FROM ALL THAT OUT. AND

01:25:09.237 --> 01:25:10.638
I AND I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND AND-

01:25:10.705 --> 01:25:12.106
AS I SAID. WHEN I BEGAN I HAVE.

01:25:12.173 --> 01:25:13.875
A SUPPORT I GUESS. YOU KNOW PART

01:25:13.942 --> 01:25:15.877
OF WHAT I THINK WORK THIS

01:25:15.944 --> 01:25:16.978
COMMITTEE WORKED. HARD ON IN

01:25:17.045 --> 01:25:18.680
THAT PROCESS AND IF YOU WANT TO

01:25:18.746 --> 01:25:20.815
SPEAK TO THIS. WAS THIS PIECE

01:25:20.882 --> 01:25:21.749
ABOUT. YOU KNOW THAT AT. WITH WE

01:25:21.816 --> 01:25:23.818
COMMENTED ON ABOUT. THE YOU KNOW

01:25:23.885 --> 01:25:24.452
THE UNINTENTIONALLY ADDED THAT

01:25:24.519 --> 01:25:25.854
YOU KNOW THE PARTS THAT ARE

01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:27.655
COMING FROM SAY WATER OTHER

01:25:27.722 --> 01:25:28.256
INGREDIENTS AND I THINK IT'S

01:25:28.323 --> 01:25:30.091
CRITICAL THAT WE- YOU KNOW MAKE

01:25:30.158 --> 01:25:31.392
SURE THAT WE'RE- DOING THAT

01:25:31.459 --> 01:25:33.228
WHICH I THINK. MR RESEARCH YOU

01:25:33.294 --> 01:25:34.863
DID A GOOD JOB OF MAKING SURE

01:25:34.929 --> 01:25:37.365
WAS DONE IN THE END OF HIS BILL

01:25:37.432 --> 01:25:39.033
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE NOW BACK

01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:39.801
TO SQUARE ONE AND I'M JUST

01:25:39.868 --> 01:25:40.835
FEELING LIKE. WHY RE WE

01:25:40.902 --> 01:25:42.103
RENEGOTIATING. VINEGARS YEAH.

01:25:42.170 --> 01:25:45.073
BACK TO SQUARE ONE I FEEL LIKE

01:25:45.139 --> 01:25:46.140
WE'RE BUILDING ON THE- EXCELLENT

01:25:46.207 --> 01:25:48.743
WORK THAT HE DID. IS REALLY

01:25:48.810 --> 01:25:51.212
WHAT'S HAPPENING. FORGET AT OKAY

01:25:51.279 --> 01:25:53.147
DO IT SO I GUESS I'D WANT TO

01:25:53.214 --> 01:25:54.249
HEAR FROM OF YOU I ARE YOU

01:25:54.315 --> 01:25:55.416
COMMITTEE TO GETTING TO

01:25:55.483 --> 01:25:56.718
BASICALLY WHERE WE GOT TO IN

01:25:56.784 --> 01:25:57.852
TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY SIX WHICH

01:25:57.919 --> 01:25:59.287
WAS INSURING THAT THOSE FILES

01:25:59.354 --> 01:26:00.855
THAT ARE NOT INTENSELY ADDED

01:26:00.922 --> 01:26:02.790
THAT ARE JUST IN THE ENVIRONMENT

01:26:02.857 --> 01:26:04.058
THAT END UP IN THESE PRODUCTS

01:26:04.125 --> 01:26:05.260
ARE NOT PART OF WHAT WE'RE

01:26:05.326 --> 01:26:06.728
FOCUSED ON. DIFFERENT TRYING TO

01:26:06.794 --> 01:26:07.862
UNDERSTAND SO WE ARE WORKING

01:26:07.929 --> 01:26:09.497
WITH THE COSMETIC INDUSTRY TO

01:26:09.564 --> 01:26:10.231
MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS

01:26:10.298 --> 01:26:12.166
INTENTIONALLY ADDED ACCOUNT WE

01:26:12.233 --> 01:26:13.635
DON'T WANNA YOU KNOW WE ALSO

01:26:13.701 --> 01:26:15.737
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S NOT

01:26:15.803 --> 01:26:16.971
SORT OF THIS LOOPHOLE AND HE

01:26:17.038 --> 01:26:18.640
COULDN'T THEY THEY CAN JUST SAY

01:26:18.706 --> 01:26:19.941
HEY WE DON'T MEAN TO SO WE'RE

01:26:20.008 --> 01:26:22.110
WORKING WITH THEM AND YOU KNOW

01:26:22.176 --> 01:26:24.846
IF YOU LOOK AT THE LETTER OF

01:26:24.913 --> 01:26:26.080
SUPPORT THERE'S ACTUALLY A LOT

01:26:26.147 --> 01:26:27.282
OF COSMETIC COMPANIES HAVE

01:26:27.348 --> 01:26:28.416
SIGNED ON IN SUPPORT OF THE

01:26:28.483 --> 01:26:30.218
BILL- AND- AS YOU HEARD EVEN THE

01:26:30.285 --> 01:26:31.786
OPPOSITION. I KNOW WE HAVE TO DO

01:26:31.853 --> 01:26:33.087
THIS THEY KNOW THERE'S STILL A

01:26:33.154 --> 01:26:35.023
PROBLEM SO WE'RE WE ARE

01:26:35.089 --> 01:26:35.657
COMMITTED TO CONTINUING WORKING

01:26:35.723 --> 01:26:36.891
WITH THEM AND THE FACT THAT I

01:26:36.958 --> 01:26:38.860
DID REACH OUT TO THEM BEFORE WE

01:26:38.927 --> 01:26:40.795
EVEN STEP TO SAY WE'RE THINKING

01:26:40.862 --> 01:26:42.630
OF DOING THIS WHAT ARE YOUR

01:26:42.697 --> 01:26:43.231
THOUGHTS AND- WE WE'VE BEEN

01:26:43.298 --> 01:26:44.198
WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THEM

01:26:44.265 --> 01:26:45.934
AND I THINK I'M BECAUSE THEY'VE

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:47.902
BEEN REALLY GOOD PARTNERS AND

01:26:47.969 --> 01:26:48.803
WILL CONTINUE TO YOU KNOW WE

01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:50.038
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS

01:26:50.104 --> 01:26:51.940
DOABLE FOR THAT WE'RE NOT HOW TO

01:26:52.006 --> 01:26:54.275
DO A GUY. WE WANT TO PUSH THEM.

01:26:54.342 --> 01:26:55.843
ALL THE MANUFACTURER. WE CLING.

01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:56.711
THEIR ACT. BECAUSE NONE OF US.

01:26:56.778 --> 01:26:58.780
WE ALL WANT TO. HELLO THOUGH HE

01:26:58.846 --> 01:27:00.648
BUYS A- ON THE SHOW. HERE THAT

01:27:00.715 --> 01:27:02.617
WE KNOW THAT WE'RE NOT HURTING

01:27:02.684 --> 01:27:03.217
OURSELVES. ARE HEARD AND WATER

01:27:03.284 --> 01:27:04.852
SUPPLIES WILL CONTINUE TO WORK

01:27:04.919 --> 01:27:06.154
WITH THEM. SEVEN CAN YOU ADDRESS

01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:07.021
THE- M. TICKET. THE ANALYSIS

01:27:07.088 --> 01:27:08.189
ACTUALLY TALKED. CHAU WHICH I'D

01:27:08.256 --> 01:27:09.290
NEVER. BEFORE READING THE

01:27:09.357 --> 01:27:12.827
ANALYSIS OF THE HONEST- BUT- ARE

01:27:12.894 --> 01:27:14.329
WE ADDRESSING THAT CONCERN.

01:27:14.395 --> 01:27:15.763
ANALYSIS IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE

01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:17.298
THERE'S ANY EVIDENCE THAT

01:27:17.365 --> 01:27:18.433
THAT'S- POSING THE SAME CONCERN

01:27:18.499 --> 01:27:20.668
THE P. FIVE SAYS. SO WE FEEL

01:27:20.735 --> 01:27:22.370
THAT THE EVEN THOUGH INNER

01:27:22.437 --> 01:27:23.438
DIDN'T REFRIGERATE AND

01:27:23.504 --> 01:27:24.839
REFRIGERATE INDUSTRY THESE ARE

01:27:24.906 --> 01:27:26.374
SAFE PRODUCTS BUT THERE'S ALSO

01:27:26.441 --> 01:27:27.675
EVIDENCE THAT WHETHER YOU SOME

01:27:27.742 --> 01:27:28.743
PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS THAT COME

01:27:28.810 --> 01:27:30.178
IN CONTACT WITH WATER THEY TURN

01:27:30.244 --> 01:27:31.946
INTO ANOTHER MATERIAL. WHICH IS

01:27:32.013 --> 01:27:34.082
CALLED TFA WHICH DOES HAVE

01:27:34.148 --> 01:27:36.384
NEGATIVE HEALTH IMPACTS SO WE'RE

01:27:36.451 --> 01:27:38.319
SAYING FINE USE THAT IN YOUR

01:27:38.386 --> 01:27:38.987
REFRIGERATION PRODUCTS BUT LET'S

01:27:39.053 --> 01:27:40.855
NOT PUT INTO PRODUCTS THAT WERE

01:27:40.922 --> 01:27:41.990
SPRING ON OUR BODIES THAT END UP

01:27:42.056 --> 01:27:43.992
NEXT IN WATER. BECAUSE THOSE

01:27:44.058 --> 01:27:44.959
HEALTH IMPACTS IT'S NOT SO CLEAR

01:27:45.026 --> 01:27:46.894
ABOUT THAT SO BENIGN. WE WILL

01:27:46.961 --> 01:27:48.496
CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT

01:27:48.563 --> 01:27:49.497
CONVERSATION BUT- WE WANT TO

01:27:49.564 --> 01:27:50.932
MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE SAFE

01:27:50.999 --> 01:27:51.799
BECAUSE THERE ARE KNOWN

01:27:51.866 --> 01:27:52.800
ALTERNATIVES RIGHT NOW THAT ARE

01:27:52.867 --> 01:27:58.573
USED. AT OUR STATE WHICH IS

01:27:58.640 --> 01:27:59.207
COMPRESSED AIR OR NITROGEN. AND

01:27:59.273 --> 01:28:00.942
ALSO THE OF THE H. OPPOSE ARE

01:28:01.009 --> 01:28:03.544
NOT. MEDICS AT THIS POINT SO YOU

01:28:03.611 --> 01:28:04.178
KNOW IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S

01:28:04.245 --> 01:28:04.912
GOING TO DISRUPT WHAT'S

01:28:04.979 --> 01:28:06.080
HAPPENING IN COSMETICS WE JUST

01:28:06.147 --> 01:28:07.982
DON'T WANT THEM TO BE USED UNTIL

01:28:08.049 --> 01:28:09.884
WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE REALLY SAFE

01:28:09.951 --> 01:28:11.319
YOU KNOW IN PERSONAL CARE

01:28:11.386 --> 01:28:12.053
PRODUCTS. VERITY AND VERITY

01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:13.988
BEING I DON'T KNOW AND IT SOUNDS

01:28:14.055 --> 01:28:15.690
LIKE THEY'RE BEING USED IN

01:28:15.757 --> 01:28:17.592
AEROSOLS RIGHT WHICH ARE YOU.

01:28:17.659 --> 01:28:19.227
KNOW THEY'RE NOT. OKAY SURE.

01:28:19.293 --> 01:28:21.496
SURE IF I COULD- EACH OF THOSE

01:28:21.562 --> 01:28:24.399
ARE JUST NOW BEING- THE PLAN IS

01:28:24.465 --> 01:28:26.334
TO INTRODUCE THEM AS AN AEROSOL.

01:28:26.401 --> 01:28:28.236
AND ACCORDING TO EWG HAS ITS

01:28:28.302 --> 01:28:29.971
LARGE SKIN DEEP DATABASE AND WE

01:28:30.038 --> 01:28:31.706
HAVE ABOUT SEVENTY THOUSAND.

01:28:31.773 --> 01:28:33.007
PRODUCTS THAT WE HAVE-

01:28:33.074 --> 01:28:34.842
INGREDIENTS FOR AND WE DID A

01:28:34.909 --> 01:28:36.277
POLL OF THAT. AND FOUND THAT

01:28:36.344 --> 01:28:38.246
ONLY TWO OF THOSE PRODUCTS

01:28:38.312 --> 01:28:40.515
CONTAINED IT H. F. O.'S OKAY.

01:28:40.581 --> 01:28:42.517
AND SO IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING-

01:28:42.583 --> 01:28:44.552
FROM. TALKING WITH THE

01:28:44.619 --> 01:28:46.554
MANUFACTURERS THAT. THIS IS

01:28:46.621 --> 01:28:47.655
SOMETHING THAT THEY ARE POISED

01:28:47.722 --> 01:28:49.957
TO BRING INTO THE MARKET AND SO

01:28:50.024 --> 01:28:52.026
WE WOULD JUST HOPE THAT THEY

01:28:52.093 --> 01:28:53.261
WOULD. MAYBE TRY TO PIT YOU KNOW

01:28:53.327 --> 01:28:54.796
AWAY BECAUSE IT IT DOES ACTUALLY

01:28:54.862 --> 01:28:56.197
BREAK DOWN INTO ANOTHER TYPE OF

01:28:56.264 --> 01:28:58.633
P. FAST WHICH IS THE TFA THAT IS

01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:00.168
A PERSISTENT CHEMICAL. IN THE

01:29:00.234 --> 01:29:01.936

GET RID OF OUR AEROSOL HAIRSPRAY

01:29:11.746 --> 01:29:13.114
IS BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT ON. THE

CALIFORNIA WHICH IS MOVING TO

01:34:32.433 --> 01:34:34.101
RESTRICT. AN ASSOCIATION CLARIFY

01:34:34.168 --> 01:34:35.069
. THAT IT'S FOR AGRICULTURAL

01:34:35.136 --> 01:34:36.937
USES ONLY. AND SHORING UP THE

SO WE'RE HERE TODAY REALLY TO

01:34:45.312 --> 01:34:46.914
FOCUS ON WHAT IS A PROBLEM

01:34:46.981 --> 01:34:48.783
PLAGUING CALIFORNIA AND TO BE

01:34:48.849 --> 01:34:51.152
FRANK THE ENTIRE WORLD WHICH IS

01:34:51.218 --> 01:34:52.486
AB THE PRODUCTS THAT ARE KILLING

01:34:52.553 --> 01:34:54.021
OUR BEE POPULATION WHICH ARE

01:34:54.088 --> 01:34:54.955
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO

01:34:55.022 --> 01:34:56.624
BIODIVERSITY BUT ALSO TO OUR

01:34:56.690 --> 01:34:59.593
AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY-

01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:01.262
CALIFORNIA BEEKEEPERS LOST OVER

01:35:01.328 --> 01:35:03.264
41% OF THEIR EARNINGS LAST YEAR

01:35:03.330 --> 01:35:04.532
ONE OF THE WORST YEARS ON

01:35:04.598 --> 01:35:06.167
RECORD. EVIDENCE IS MOUNTING

01:35:06.233 --> 01:35:07.501
THAT THIS PRIMARILY CAUSED BY

01:35:07.568 --> 01:35:09.203
PESTICIDES AND SPECIFICALLY THE

01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:10.538
CLASS OF PESTICIDES WE'RE

01:35:10.604 --> 01:35:10.971
TALKING ABOUT TODAY

01:35:11.038 --> 01:35:13.207
NEONICOTINOIDS LHASA POLLINATORS

01:35:13.274 --> 01:35:15.209
ENDANGERS UPWARDS OF ELEVEN

01:35:15.276 --> 01:35:16.444
BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN

01:35:16.510 --> 01:35:18.612
STATE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION

01:35:18.679 --> 01:35:20.081
AND IS ALREADY LIMITING DEALS

01:35:20.147 --> 01:35:21.682
AND DRIVING UP FOOD PRICES THIS

01:35:21.749 --> 01:35:23.217
IS REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN WE

01:35:23.284 --> 01:35:24.618
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH BEES TO

01:35:24.685 --> 01:35:26.487
POLLINATE OUR PLANTS FOOD IS

01:35:26.554 --> 01:35:28.055
HARDER TO GROW AND PRICES RISE

01:35:28.122 --> 01:35:30.257
AND RIGHT NOW WITH PRICES RISING

01:35:30.324 --> 01:35:32.226
ALREADY IN FOOD AND OTHER

01:35:32.293 --> 01:35:33.294
NECESSITIES IT'S REALLY CRITICAL

01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:35.763
WE DO WHAT WE CAN. TO PROTECT

01:35:35.830 --> 01:35:38.265
OUR FOOD CROPS CALIFORNIA HAS A

01:35:38.332 --> 01:35:39.500
ROBOT INFRASTRUCTURE FOR

01:35:39.567 --> 01:35:41.202
REGULATING PESTICIDES AND A

01:35:41.268 --> 01:35:43.003
PERMANENT SIDE REGULATIONS HAS

01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:43.938
ALREADY INCREASED RESTRICTIONS

01:35:44.004 --> 01:35:45.239
OF NEONICOTINOIDS IN THE

01:35:45.306 --> 01:35:47.041
AGRICULTURAL SETTING. THAT'S WHY

01:35:47.108 --> 01:35:48.275
WE'RE FOCUSED ON NOT

01:35:48.342 --> 01:35:51.479
AGRICULTURAL HERE TODAY- AND

01:35:51.545 --> 01:35:53.447
THOSE ARE THE GAPS THAT WE SEE

01:35:53.514 --> 01:35:54.849
FOR THE USE OF THESE CHEMICALS

01:35:54.915 --> 01:35:57.017
NEONICOTINOID USE ON LAWNS

01:35:57.084 --> 01:35:59.019
GARDENS AND GOLF COURSES IS

01:35:59.086 --> 01:36:01.021
ALMOST ENTIRELY UNNECESSARY

01:36:01.088 --> 01:36:02.790
USERS COVER THEIR PROPERTY WITH

01:36:02.857 --> 01:36:04.625
GRANULES AND WATER THEM INTO THE

01:36:04.692 --> 01:36:06.994
SOIL MANY LONDONERS DON'T EVEN

01:36:07.061 --> 01:36:08.462
KNOW THIS IS HAPPENING THE

01:36:08.529 --> 01:36:09.897
CHEMICALS PROCEED TO SEEP INTO

01:36:09.964 --> 01:36:12.600
THE WATER SUPPLY TRAVEL TRIP TO

01:36:12.666 --> 01:36:13.667
SPENDING IT'S AN ABSORBENT PLAN

01:36:13.734 --> 01:36:17.905
THAT. NADER'S CONSUME. COMMENTS

01:36:17.972 --> 01:36:19.874
ARE LEARN AS A I NEED AND ARE A-

01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:21.342
BUT ALTERNATIVES LIKE DYNAMITE

01:36:21.408 --> 01:36:22.910
THAT CAN REPLACE NEAR NEXT WHEN

01:36:22.977 --> 01:36:24.445
NECESSARY. THE OPPOSITION'S

01:36:24.512 --> 01:36:26.113
ARGUED THAT THE BILL LIMITS

01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:27.281
NECESSARY USE OF NEONICS IN

01:36:27.348 --> 01:36:28.249
ADDITION TO THESE NON

01:36:28.315 --> 01:36:29.884

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA STRONGLY

01:40:35.162 --> 01:40:36.563
SUGGESTING THAT NON AGRICULTURAL

01:40:36.630 --> 01:40:38.465
USES OF NEONICS ARE A MAJOR

01:40:38.532 --> 01:40:40.801
SOURCE OF POLLUTION. IT ALSO

01:40:40.868 --> 01:40:42.202
PROVIDES EVIDENCE OF UBIQUITOUS

01:40:42.269 --> 01:40:43.504
CONTAMINATION OF NOT JUST

01:40:43.570 --> 01:40:46.407
CALIFORNIA'S BORDER BUT ALSO

01:40:46.473 --> 01:40:47.841
IT'S SO IT'LL AND PLANT LIFE.

01:40:47.908 --> 01:40:50.043
INSEMINATION EVEN EXTENDS TO OUR

01:40:50.110 --> 01:40:52.479
BODIES CDC MONITORING SHOWS THAT

01:40:52.546 --> 01:40:54.415
HALF OF AMERICANS ARE EXPOSED TO

NEONICS ON ANY GIVEN DAY BUT THE

01:40:57.451 --> 01:40:57.885
HIGHEST LEVELS FOUND IN

01:40:57.951 --> 01:40:59.720
CHILDREN. RESEARCH INDICATES

01:40:59.787 --> 01:41:01.588
INCREASINGLY INDICATE CAUSE FOR

CONCERN ABOUT EXPOSURE TO THESE

01:41:04.358 --> 01:41:06.093

NON AGRICULTURAL USES ARE

01:41:24.445 --> 01:41:26.447
UNNECESSARY FOR REPLACEABLE.

01:41:26.513 --> 01:41:27.948
BECAUSE NEONICS ARE SYSTEMIC

01:41:28.015 --> 01:41:29.750
THEY'RE ALMOST ALWAYS APPLIED

IN RECOGNITION OF THE WORK BY

THE USEPA AND THE LACK OF

ADEQUATE SCIENCE TO SUPPORT THIS

IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL- AND

01:44:56.823 --> 01:44:57.924

AGRICULTURAL USES INTO THE BILL.

01:45:06.333 --> 01:45:07.334
I DO BELIEVE THAT THE RECENT

01:45:07.401 --> 01:45:08.902
AMENDMENTS HELP MOVE IT IN THAT

01:45:08.969 --> 01:45:10.103
DIRECTIONS BY TAKING OUT THE

01:45:10.170 --> 01:45:11.104

RESTRICTED. USE PRODUCTS.

01:45:13.473 --> 01:45:14.541
HOWEVER WE STILL HAVE SOME

01:45:14.608 --> 01:45:16.843
CONCERNS WITH THE BILL IS THE

01:45:16.910 --> 01:45:18.045
WAY IT'S- SET UP. PRIMARY

01:45:18.111 --> 01:45:19.880
CONCERN AT THIS POINT IS THE-

01:45:19.946 --> 01:45:21.415
LANGUAGE IN THE BILL DEALING

01:45:21.481 --> 01:45:22.949
WITH THE EMERGENCY-

01:45:23.016 --> 01:45:24.484
AUTHORIZATION REQUIREMENT

01:45:24.551 --> 01:45:26.253
EMERGENCY. HOW IT OULD PUT TO

01:45:26.319 --> 01:45:28.055
THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT

01:45:28.121 --> 01:45:30.223
OF PESTICIDE REGULATION. IN THE

01:45:30.290 --> 01:45:32.492
LEAD OF ACTUALL DETERMINE WHEN

01:45:32.559 --> 01:45:34.594
THERE IS A PASSED EMERGENCY. HI

01:45:34.661 --> 01:45:36.830
DPR THEY'RE GREAT WHAT THEY DO

01:45:36.897 --> 01:45:38.131
BUT THEY'RE TOXICOLOGIST THEY'RE

01:45:38.198 --> 01:45:40.267
NOT ENTOMOLOGISTS. AND SO IT'S

01:45:40.333 --> 01:45:42.302
CDFA- THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT

01:45:42.369 --> 01:45:43.837
OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE THE

01:45:43.904 --> 01:45:45.439
DETERMINES INVASIVE PESTS LOOKS

01:45:45.505 --> 01:45:47.340
AT INVASIVE PRESS PROGRAMS.

01:45:47.407 --> 01:45:48.775
ESTABLISHES QUARANTINES

01:45:48.842 --> 01:45:50.510
ESTABLISH MEDICATION MEASURES-

01:45:50.577 --> 01:45:52.179
THAT DEALS WITH THOSE TYPES OF

01:45:52.245 --> 01:45:54.147
ISSUES AND SO. I THINK THAT THAT

01:45:54.214 --> 01:45:57.050
NEEDS TO BE A REALLY RE THOUGHT

01:45:57.117 --> 01:45:58.018
ABOUT- IF WE'RE MOVING DOWN THAT

01:45:58.085 --> 01:45:59.920
PATHWAY. THEN WE HAVE THE

01:45:59.986 --> 01:46:00.754
EXAMPLE OF THE CALIFORNIA'S

01:46:00.821 --> 01:46:03.790
CITRUS INDUSTRY- THAT- REALLY

01:46:03.857 --> 01:46:06.159
HAS THIS INTERFACE WITH URBAN

01:46:06.226 --> 01:46:08.361
USE OF PRODUCTS. HOW WE'VE BEEN

01:46:08.428 --> 01:46:09.329
FIGHTING THE ASIAN CITRUS

01:46:09.396 --> 01:46:11.565
PSYLLID WHICH TRANSMITS ONE LONG

01:46:11.631 --> 01:46:13.433
BANG FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS.

01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:15.135
THERE ARE MORE BACKYARD CITRUS

01:46:15.202 --> 01:46:16.870
TREES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:46:16.937 --> 01:46:18.205
THEN THERE ARE CITRUS TREES IN

01:46:18.271 --> 01:46:19.806
PRODUCTION. AND IT'S THOSE

01:46:19.873 --> 01:46:21.308
BACKYARD CITRUS TREES WERE WE

01:46:21.374 --> 01:46:23.643
FOUND THAT THEY HARBOR AND THEY

01:46:23.710 --> 01:46:25.612
SPREAD THE ASIAN CITRU PSYLLID.

01:46:25.679 --> 01:46:27.781
AND SO WE IN THE CITRUS INDUSTRY

01:46:27.848 --> 01:46:29.449
HAVE INVESTED MILLIONS OF

01:46:29.516 --> 01:46:31.451
DOLLARS OVER THE LAST DECADE. ON

01:46:31.518 --> 01:46:32.686
A PROGRAM THAT DOES EDUCATION

01:46:32.753 --> 01:46:35.222
AND OUTREACH TO THOSE CONSUMERS

01:46:35.288 --> 01:46:37.324
TO BETTER PROTECT THEIR TREES.

01:46:37.390 --> 01:46:40.060
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:46:40.127 --> 01:46:40.660
THERE'S PRODUCTS AVAILABLE FOR

01:46:40.727 --> 01:46:42.562
THAT. NOT ONLY SO CONSUMERS CAN

01:46:42.629 --> 01:46:44.197
CONTINUE TO HAVE BACK ARE COME

01:46:44.264 --> 01:46:46.032
CHRIS AT. CITRUS TREES. BUT THAT

01:46:46.099 --> 01:46:47.300
THEY DON'T CREATE THAT

01:46:47.367 --> 01:46:50.871
ADDITIONAL HARM. AND EXPOSURE-

01:46:50.937 --> 01:46:52.439
TO THE TWO BILLION DOLLAR

01:46:52.506 --> 01:46:54.708
COMMERCIAL CITRUS INDUSTRY. AND

01:46:54.775 --> 01:46:57.277
OUR FINAL POINT WOULD BE MORE ON

01:46:57.344 --> 01:46:57.911
JUST A LITTLE BIT OF PRINCIPLE

01:46:57.978 --> 01:46:59.646
WE DO HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:46:59.713 --> 01:47:01.014

01:47:01.081 --> 01:47:02.249
RENOWNED. FOR ITS TOXICOLOGIST

01:47:02.315 --> 01:47:03.383
AND THE MITIGATION MEASURES IN

01:47:03.450 --> 01:47:04.751
THE SCIENCE THAT ARE PUT INTO

01:47:04.818 --> 01:47:06.353
THE REGISTRATION OF PRODUCTS

01:47:06.419 --> 01:47:07.854
AFTER A PRODUCT IS REGISTERED AT

01:47:07.921 --> 01:47:10.190
USEPA IT TAKES ANOTHER THREE TO

01:47:10.257 --> 01:47:11.858
FIVE YEARS. ANOTHER TENS OF

01:47:11.925 --> 01:47:13.293
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO REGISTER

01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:14.728
THAT PRODUCT FOR THE USE IN THE

01:47:14.795 --> 01:47:17.130
STATE OF CALIFORNIA IF WE THINK

01:47:17.197 --> 01:47:19.299
THAT THEY'RE RE. MISSED THE

01:47:19.366 --> 01:47:21.468
MARK- AS IT RELATES TO THESE

01:47:21.535 --> 01:47:23.136
PRODUCTS THEN LET'S ASK THEM TO

01:47:23.203 --> 01:47:25.338
DO IT AGAIN THEY CHOSE NOT TO

01:47:25.405 --> 01:47:27.340
USE TO LOOK AT THE NON

01:47:27.407 --> 01:47:28.809
AGRICULTURAL USES BECAUSE THEY

01:47:28.875 --> 01:47:30.177
THOUGHT THE RISK WAS LOW. IF YOU

01:47:30.243 --> 01:47:32.112
THE LEGISLATURE DISAGREED WITH

01:47:32.179 --> 01:47:33.980

01:56:29.349 --> 01:56:30.983
THEY HAVE DONE INCREDIBLE WORK

01:56:31.050 --> 01:56:32.819

IT WHEN WE DO HAVE FULL POWERS

01:56:41.527 --> 01:56:42.795

IT DIDN'T FIT INTO THE SCHEME

01:58:58.564 --> 01:59:01.367
POPULATION HAS GONE DOWN. THE

01:59:01.434 --> 01:59:02.568
INSECTS ARE AT THE BASE OF THE

01:59:02.635 --> 01:59:04.871

THAT THESE INSECTS THAT. WE

01:59:20.286 --> 01:59:22.622
