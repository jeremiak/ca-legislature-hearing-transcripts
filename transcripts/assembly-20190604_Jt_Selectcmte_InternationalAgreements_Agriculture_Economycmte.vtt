AGAIN I BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO

00:47:54.838 --> 00:47:56.573

AS I BEGAN PREPARING THIS

00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:02.479
TESTIMONY LAST WEEK I DID NOT

00:48:02.546 --> 00:48:04.881
THINK THERE WOULD BE A THIRD

00:48:04.948 --> 00:48:06.450
CATEGORY OF TERRACE.

00:48:06.516 --> 00:48:09.019

00:48:24.501 --> 00:48:26.270
THIS PROPOSED POLICY HAS BEEN

00:48:43.487 --> 00:48:45.555
THE LEGAL JUSTIFICATION BEING

CALIFORNIA IS ENORMOUS. FOR A

00:50:26.256 --> 00:50:28.058

ANNUALLY.

00:50:36.933 --> 00:50:39.069
THIS IS LARGER THAN THE ENTIRE

BUDGET.

00:50:40.036 --> 00:50:44.074
OF FORTY ONE INDIVIDUAL STATES.

00:50:44.141 --> 00:50:45.709
IT'S ALSO WORTH MENTIONING THAT

THIS POLICY APPEARS TO BE IN

00:50:47.644 --> 00:50:49.646

I'D LIKE TO SHARE IN CLOSING.

00:53:14.724 --> 00:53:16.159
FIRST WE'VE BEEN TOLD BY

00:53:16.226 --> 00:53:17.694
OFFICIALS AT THE PORT OF LOS

00:53:17.761 --> 00:53:19.663

201814%.

00:53:33.643 --> 00:53:35.779
WE ALSO KNOW THAT RURAL AREAS OF

THE STATE ARE SUFFERING

00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:39.215
DISPROPORTIONATELY AS RURAL

00:53:39.282 --> 00:53:41.318
INDUSTRIES LIKE AGRICULTURE IN

00:53:41.384 --> 00:53:43.053
LOGISTICS HAVE SIGNIFICANT

00:53:43.119 --> 00:53:45.322
EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN THE TRADE

00:53:45.388 --> 00:53:46.489

00:53:46.556 --> 00:53:48.358
IF FACT ON CHANGING TERRACES

00:53:48.425 --> 00:53:50.560
ALSO DISPROPORTIONATELY FELL BY

00:53:50.627 --> 00:53:52.329
CALIFORNIA SMALL AND MEDIUM

00:53:52.395 --> 00:53:53.797
SIZED BUSINESSES.

00:53:53.863 --> 00:53:54.898
THEY DO NOT HAVE THE SAME

00:53:54.965 --> 00:53:57.467
RESOURCES AS LARGE COMPANIES TO

00:53:57.534 --> 00:53:59.703
SHIP THEIR SUPPLY CHAIN OR FIND

00:53:59.769 --> 00:54:04.908
NEW INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS TO

00:54:04.975 --> 00:54:08.378
FINALLY ONE SUPPLY CHAINS CHANGE

00:54:08.445 --> 00:54:11.047
IS VERY HARD TO GET THEM BACK.

00:54:11.114 --> 00:54:13.750
FOR EXAMPLE LAST YEAR CALIFORNIA

00:54:13.817 --> 00:54:16.086
WINE EXPORTS TO CHINA FELL

00:54:16.152 --> 00:54:18.922

00:54:20.290 --> 00:54:22.058
ENTERING INTO CHINA FROM THE

00:54:22.125 --> 00:54:25.695
UNITED STATES REACHED NEARLY 80%.

00:54:25.762 --> 00:54:27.664
DEMAND HAS QUICKLY BEEN ABSORBED

00:54:27.731 --> 00:54:30.500
BY INCREASED EXPORTS FROM CHILE

00:54:30.567 --> 00:54:32.035
AND AUSTRALIA THAT HAVE SEEN

00:54:32.102 --> 00:54:34.437
THEIR WINE EXPORTS TO CHINA

00:54:34.504 --> 00:54:36.773
SEARCH.

00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:39.009
IT IS VERY POSSIBLE THAT WE WILL

00:54:39.075 --> 00:54:41.611
NOT SEE AN END TO THESE TRADE

00:54:41.678 --> 00:54:43.513
DISPUTES ANYTIME SOON.

00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:45.548
AND ARCH STATE WILL BE IMPACTED

00:54:45.615 --> 00:54:47.117
FOR SOME TIME.

00:54:47.183 --> 00:54:49.586
THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE WITH A

00:54:49.653 --> 00:54:51.655
THREE OH ONE TERRACE ON CHINA.

00:54:51.721 --> 00:54:53.156
NOW THAT THE PROCEDURE TO TAKE

00:54:53.223 --> 00:54:54.991
ACTION ON THREE OH ONE

00:54:55.058 --> 00:54:56.726
VIOLATIONS HAS BEEN GONE.

00:54:56.793 --> 00:54:57.927
THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF

00:54:57.994 --> 00:55:00.130
CONSENSUS INCLUDING BIPARTISAN

00:55:00.196 --> 00:55:01.998
CONSENSUS THAT THE FEDERAL

00:55:02.065 --> 00:55:03.600
GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT LEAVE THE

00:55:03.667 --> 00:55:06.036
NEGOTIATING TABLE AND TELL THERE

00:55:06.102 --> 00:55:07.737
IS MEANINGFUL RESOLUTION.

00:55:07.804 --> 00:55:09.439
WITH THE LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY

00:55:09.506 --> 00:55:11.141
INVOLVED AND CHINA'S RECENT

00:55:11.207 --> 00:55:12.942
SIGNALS THAT THEY ARE NOT

00:55:13.009 --> 00:55:14.277
WILLING TO BEND ON SOME KEY

00:55:14.344 --> 00:55:16.012
PROVISIONS THIS COULD TAKE A

00:55:16.079 --> 00:55:18.348
LONG TIME.

00:55:18.415 --> 00:55:19.783
AS TO THE CURRENT SITUATION WITH

00:55:19.849 --> 00:55:22.052
MEXICO I MUST SAY IT IS

00:55:22.118 --> 00:55:24.654
DISMAYING IN MANY WAYS.

00:55:24.721 --> 00:55:26.056
MEXICO WAS A FRIEND OF THE

00:55:26.122 --> 00:55:28.191
UNITED STATES AND A VALUED

00:55:28.258 --> 00:55:29.092
PARTNER.

00:55:29.159 --> 00:55:30.960
CALIFORNIA'S COOPERATION WITH

00:55:31.027 --> 00:55:33.063
MEXICO HAS SUPPORTED A SAFE

00:55:33.129 --> 00:55:35.932
SECURE AND PROSPEROUS BORDER.

00:55:35.999 --> 00:55:37.667
OUR TRADE RELATIONSHIP HAS

00:55:37.734 --> 00:55:38.702
BROUGHT OPPORTUNITY AND

00:55:38.768 --> 00:55:41.805
PROSPERITY TO BOTH SITES.

00:55:41.871 --> 00:55:43.006
AT LEAST FOURTEEN MILLION

00:55:43.073 --> 00:55:45.108
CALIFORNIANS ARE OF LATINO

00:55:45.175 --> 00:55:46.409
HERITAGE.

00:55:46.476 --> 00:55:48.144
OUR PARTNERS IN MEXICO CAN BE

00:55:48.211 --> 00:55:50.180
ASSURED THE CALIFORNIA STANDS

00:55:50.246 --> 00:55:52.382
READY TO SPEAK OUT.

00:55:52.449 --> 00:55:53.650
AS TO THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR

00:55:53.717 --> 00:55:57.353
RELATIONSHIP AND OUR FRIENDSHIP.

00:55:57.420 --> 00:56:00.657

THE POLICY GOALS MIGHT BE.

00:56:22.245 --> 00:56:23.747
WELL I THINK THAT'S WHY IT WAS

00:56:23.813 --> 00:56:25.381
SO IMPORTANT TO REALLY LAY OUT

00:56:25.448 --> 00:56:26.916
THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS AND THE

00:56:26.983 --> 00:56:28.918
LEGAL REGIME THAT IS GOVERNING

00:56:28.985 --> 00:56:30.086

00:56:43.233 --> 00:56:44.734
VIOLATIONS.

00:56:44.801 --> 00:56:46.169
YOU CAN'T JUST GO BACK TO THE

00:56:46.236 --> 00:56:49.405
STATUS QUO YOU HAVE TO SIT DOWN

00:56:49.472 --> 00:56:51.174

PLAN TAKING PLACE AND THEY HAVE

00:56:57.247 --> 00:56:58.014

00:57:39.022 --> 00:57:40.824
REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY ARE

00:57:40.890 --> 00:57:42.192
ABILITY TO ENSURE IN THE MARKET

AN AMBASSADOR HAVE YOU EVER SEEN

01:01:05.661 --> 01:01:06.729
MAKING POLICY BY TWEET IN THIS

01:01:06.796 --> 01:01:08.965
KIND OF A RADIC WITHOUT ANY

01:01:09.032 --> 01:01:10.933
SPECIFIC PLAN BUT IT SEEMS TO BE

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.502
INCREDIBLY REACTIVE.

01:01:12.568 --> 01:01:14.871

I CHAIRMAN EGGMAN I THINK THIS

01:01:36.726 --> 01:01:40.029
IS REALLY THE GREATEST SHAME

01:01:40.096 --> 01:01:41.664
WHICH IS THAT.

01:01:41.731 --> 01:01:44.801
THE AND ENVIRONMENT AT THE

01:01:44.867 --> 01:01:47.303
CLIMATE AROUND TRADE THAT'S

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:49.872
BEING CREATED BY THIS TYPE OF

01:01:49.939 --> 01:01:51.240
PROCESS.

01:01:51.307 --> 01:01:54.677
IS HAVING A DEEPLY CHILLING OF

01:01:54.744 --> 01:01:56.112
FACT ON TRADE.

01:01:56.179 --> 01:01:59.315
AND SO EVEN BEYOND THE TARIFFS

01:01:59.382 --> 01:02:01.818
WHICH HAVE A MEASURABLE IMPACT

01:02:01.884 --> 01:02:04.187
WHEN THE CLIMATE IS DAMPENED.

01:02:04.253 --> 01:02:10.460
YOU UNNECESSARILY I HINDER I THE

01:02:10.526 --> 01:02:13.396
D. M. AT WORK HAVE I'VE

01:02:13.463 --> 01:02:15.198
COMPANIES THAT ARE TRYING TO

01:02:15.264 --> 01:02:17.300
EXPAND INTO BUSINESS -- WHEN YOU

01:02:17.366 --> 01:02:19.168
HAVE UNCERTAINTY AND

01:02:19.235 --> 01:02:20.536
UNPREDICTABILITY?

01:02:20.603 --> 01:02:22.572
COMPANIES GOT MORE CONSERVATIVE

01:02:22.638 --> 01:02:25.108
THEY PULL BACK -- IN TERMS OF

01:02:25.174 --> 01:02:27.743
SUPPLY CHAIN COUNTRIES THAT ARE

01:02:27.810 --> 01:02:29.479
AYE IMPORTING CALIFORNIA

01:02:29.545 --> 01:02:32.115
PRODUCTS ARE THINKING WELL MAYBE

01:02:32.181 --> 01:02:34.517
IT'S ONLY GOING TO GO ON FOR

01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:36.152
ANOTHER.

01:02:36.219 --> 01:02:38.087
WEEK OR ANOTHER YEAR MAYBE THIS

01:02:38.154 --> 01:02:39.689
IS GOING TO GO ON FOR A LONG

01:02:39.755 --> 01:02:41.791
TIME SO WE NEED TO LOOK TO OTHER

01:02:41.858 --> 01:02:44.293
SOURCES FOR OUR IMPORTS BECAUSE

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:45.394
CALIFORNIA.

01:02:45.461 --> 01:02:48.364
IS NO LONGER AS RELIABLE AS A

01:02:48.431 --> 01:02:48.764
RESULT OF THIS AND

01:02:48.831 --> 01:02:51.534
PREDICTABILITY AT SO I THINK

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:53.002
AGAIN THAT IS PROBABLY OF

01:02:53.069 --> 01:02:54.770
EVERYTHING THE MOST DAMAGING

01:02:54.837 --> 01:02:56.539
THING BECAUSE IT'S DAMAGE THAT

01:02:56.606 --> 01:02:57.473
HAS.

01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:58.941
THERE'S JUST ABSOLUTELY NO

01:02:59.008 --> 01:03:04.614
REASON WHATSOEVER OUT FOR US TO

01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:07.310
FAIRLY CERTAIN THAT THEIR

COMMITTEE ADAM.

01:04:19.121 --> 01:04:22.225
IT'S REALLY ALREADY HAD BEEN A

01:04:22.291 --> 01:04:25.595
VERY VALUABLE ADAM TOOL BECAUSE

OF COMMERCE WAS ELIMINATED.

01:04:31.634 --> 01:04:33.536
BUT THE ACTIVITY OF CALIFORNIA

01:04:33.603 --> 01:04:35.972

OUR ACTIVITY IS REALLY IMPORTANT

01:04:42.612 --> 01:04:44.981
BECAUSE WE FIND EFFICIENCIES.

01:04:45.047 --> 01:04:46.482
AND A BETTER WAY TO BE IF YOU

01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:47.850

LITTLE BIT I MENTIONED THAT

01:05:11.073 --> 01:05:12.908
CONSTRAINTS THAT WE HAVE ON

01:05:12.975 --> 01:05:14.343
TRADE WE ALSO OF COURSE ARE

01:05:14.410 --> 01:05:15.945
CONSTRAINED WHEN IT COMES TO

01:05:16.012 --> 01:05:18.581
IMMIGRATION POLICY -- BUT IN IN

01:05:18.648 --> 01:05:22.385

CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE AND THE

01:05:25.388 --> 01:05:26.656
GOVERNOR I'M ACTUALLY NOW OVER

01:05:26.722 --> 01:05:29.025
THE LAST THREE GOVERNORS HAVE

01:05:29.091 --> 01:05:32.194
MADE -- REDUCTION OF EMISSIONS

01:05:32.261 --> 01:05:33.696
AT SUCH A KEY PRIORITY AND WE

01:05:33.763 --> 01:05:35.731
HAVE THESE AGGRESSIVE TWENTY

01:05:35.798 --> 01:05:36.599
FORTY FIVE GOALS.

01:05:36.666 --> 01:05:38.301
I'M THIS IS REALLY AN IMPORTANT

01:05:38.367 --> 01:05:40.703
STORY THAT WE CAN AND SHOULD

01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:43.139
TELL ON THE NATIONAL STAGE SO

01:05:43.205 --> 01:05:44.940

LOOK AT THE VARIOUS AGENCIES

01:05:46.242 --> 01:05:47.043
FRANKLY WHETHER IT'S

01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:49.378
TRANSPORTATION OR EPA WHERE

01:05:49.445 --> 01:05:54.583
RESOURCE SAYS THERE'S A LOT OF

01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:56.252
AREA FOR COLLABORATION?

01:05:56.319 --> 01:05:56.819
AND THEN THE OTHER AREAS OF

01:05:56.886 --> 01:05:58.254
COURSE THAT RISEN TO THE TOP --

01:05:58.321 --> 01:06:00.022
OUR TRADE I AND KOBE IS ACTUALLY

01:06:00.089 --> 01:06:03.059
IS THE STAFF OF OUR COMMITTEE --

01:06:06.329 --> 01:06:08.764
STATE FIVE POINT FOUR MILLION

01:06:08.831 --> 01:06:10.966
JOBS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:06:11.033 --> 01:06:12.401

01:06:12.468 --> 01:06:13.669
INTERNATIONAL TRADE.

01:06:13.736 --> 01:06:15.971

01:06:16.038 --> 01:06:18.974
COPAYS AND THEY DON'T IT LET ME

01:06:19.041 --> 01:06:21.644

01:06:28.117 --> 01:06:29.752
STOPS THE COMMITTEE AS A WHOLE.

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:31.921
AND THEN YOU KNOW I THINK THAT

01:06:31.987 --> 01:06:34.156
WE ARE SO TRULY IMPACTED BY

01:06:34.223 --> 01:06:36.125
IMMIGRATION THAT THIS IS ANOTHER

01:06:36.192 --> 01:06:37.493
PART OF THE CONVERSATION THAT WE

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:39.061

01:06:39.128 --> 01:06:39.962
OF THESE.

01:06:40.029 --> 01:06:44.200

SO CHINA.

01:12:15.798 --> 01:12:16.365
THE CHINA HONG KONG NEXUS IS A

01:12:16.432 --> 01:12:16.865
VERY IMPORTANT PART OF A

01:12:16.932 --> 01:12:18.300
DESTINATION FOR A WHOLE RANGE OF

01:12:18.367 --> 01:12:19.935

01:12:29.745 --> 01:12:30.412
THE WORLD.

01:12:30.479 --> 01:12:31.513
I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT THE

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:33.048
TRADE TURMOIL THAT WE'RE FACING

01:12:33.115 --> 01:12:34.817

HEARD MEXICO MENTIONED SEVERAL

01:12:36.251 --> 01:12:38.654
TIMES ALREADY THIS AFTERNOON.

01:12:38.721 --> 01:12:40.089
BUT TURKEY IN INDIA AND OTHER

01:12:40.155 --> 01:12:42.224
MARKETS HAVE ALSO BEEN HIT WITH

01:12:42.291 --> 01:12:44.393
OUR STEEL TARIFFS WHICH WE HEARD

01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:45.761
SORT OF STARTED THIS CURRENT

01:12:45.828 --> 01:12:46.662
MASS.

01:12:46.729 --> 01:12:47.663
AND THEN THEY NATURALLY

01:12:47.730 --> 01:12:49.064
RETALIATED BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT

01:12:49.131 --> 01:12:51.533
THOSE WERE INAPPROPRIATE SORTS

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:52.568
OF TERRACE.

01:12:52.634 --> 01:12:54.536
I ALSO WONDER ROUTE REINFORCED

01:12:54.603 --> 01:12:55.771
AND I GIVE YOU A CHART THERE FOR

01:12:55.838 --> 01:12:58.474
WHICH AGRICULTURAL EXPORTER MOST

01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:01.810
CRUCIAL THAT IS WHICH OF OUR OF

01:13:01.877 --> 01:13:03.212
PRODUCTS FOR WHICH EXPORTS ARE

01:13:03.278 --> 01:13:04.713
MOST CRUCIAL.

01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:08.050
AND AND AGAIN IT'S A WIDE RANGE.

01:13:08.117 --> 01:13:10.385
FOR EVERYONE OF THOSE ITEMS --

01:13:10.452 --> 01:13:12.554
THEY HIRE -- FARMWORKERS AND

01:13:12.621 --> 01:13:14.256
THOSE ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE

01:13:14.323 --> 01:13:16.558
PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA ECONOMY

01:13:16.625 --> 01:13:17.359
THERE'S JUST NO QUESTION ABOUT

01:13:17.426 --> 01:13:18.060
IT.

01:13:18.127 --> 01:13:19.795
SO WHILE WE TALK ABOUT THE

EXPORT LOSSES OF COMPANIES.

01:13:23.432 --> 01:13:24.733
I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:26.301

CHERRIES OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS

01:13:30.839 --> 01:13:31.340
BECAUSE WE HAD SOME UNUSUAL

01:13:31.406 --> 01:13:32.274
RAINS.

01:13:36.411 --> 01:13:38.080
OR OR OR YOU.

01:13:38.147 --> 01:13:39.348

THE PEOPLE THE FIRST FACE THAT

01:13:43.252 --> 01:13:44.119
VULNERABILITY LE HARD

01:13:44.186 --> 01:13:45.554
FARMWORKERS THAT FRANKLY THIS

01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:49.491
SOME WORK.

01:13:49.558 --> 01:13:50.726
AND WHEN YOU LOSE A CROP EITHER

01:13:50.793 --> 01:13:51.960
DO AN EXPORT RESTRAINT DURING

01:13:52.027 --> 01:13:54.229
THIS LAST WEEK IT WAS WHETHER

01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:19.021
I'M JUST GOING TO GIVE YOU ONE

01:14:19.087 --> 01:14:21.323

01:14:22.958 --> 01:14:24.359
THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD.

01:14:24.426 --> 01:14:26.929

60% BELOW WHERE THEY WERE A

01:14:31.366 --> 01:14:33.001
COUPLE YEARS AGO IN TERMS OF

01:14:33.068 --> 01:14:34.636
PRICE THE WALL IT'S WILL GET

01:14:34.703 --> 01:14:35.971

WILL MOVE.

01:14:43.946 --> 01:14:45.914
BUT AT MUCH LOWER PRICES BECAUSE

01:14:45.981 --> 01:14:47.449
THE MARKETS THAT THEY USED TO GO

01:14:47.516 --> 01:14:49.084
TO HAVE BEEN CLOSED.

01:14:49.151 --> 01:14:51.486
AND IF YOU GAVE US OUR TEN YEARS

01:14:51.553 --> 01:14:52.754
IF IF SOMEBODY WOULD ANNOUNCE

01:14:52.821 --> 01:14:53.689
TEN YEARS FROM NOW WE'RE GONNA

01:14:53.755 --> 01:14:55.057
DO A TERROR FROM MOVE THEN

01:14:55.123 --> 01:14:56.725
PEOPLE WOULD REARRANGE MARKETS

01:14:56.792 --> 01:14:57.960
AND THIS AND THAT.

01:14:58.026 --> 01:14:59.228

THEY'VE CONTINUED.

01:15:07.402 --> 01:15:09.171
THE FINAL THING I WANT TO

01:15:09.238 --> 01:15:11.673
MENTION IS IS THE FORMER THIS IS

01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:13.742
PAINFUL I'M OF A WALNUT FARM

01:15:13.809 --> 01:15:17.212
WELL I I KNOW YOU'RE FROM WOULD

01:15:17.279 --> 01:15:17.813
YOU LIKE TO SEE ALL THE TREES

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:20.182
AND PULLING OUT -- I THINK YOU

01:15:20.249 --> 01:15:22.117
MAY BE VERY NEAR MY OF MY HOME A

01:15:22.184 --> 01:15:25.954
DAVIS IN FACT THE IN IN WINTERS

01:15:26.021 --> 01:15:29.091
YEAH YEAH -- WELL NOW IMAGINE

01:15:29.157 --> 01:15:31.894
BUT STATUTES -- I I THINK -- AS

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:34.062
SOON MATHIS MENTIONED EARLIER UP

01:15:34.129 --> 01:15:36.465
A STASH OWES OR COMPLICATED CASE.

01:15:36.531 --> 01:15:38.033
SO WE WOULD HAVE SEEN THE SAME

01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:39.768
THING I PREDICT WITH WALLETS

01:15:39.835 --> 01:15:42.371
EXCEPT IT TURNS OUT IRAN HAD THE

01:15:42.437 --> 01:15:44.006
WORST PROCESS YOU CROP IN ITS

01:15:44.072 --> 01:15:45.107
HISTORY.

01:15:45.173 --> 01:15:46.408
IS THE ONLY OTHER PLACE TO

01:15:46.475 --> 01:15:47.943
COMPETE WITH CALIFORNIA THE

01:15:48.010 --> 01:15:49.678
EXPORT MARKET.

01:15:49.745 --> 01:15:50.946
SO YOU MIGHT IF YOU WERE IF YOU

01:15:51.013 --> 01:15:52.080
IF YOU DIDN'T PAY ATTENTION

01:15:52.147 --> 01:15:56.718
THESE MARKETS YOU MIGHT SAY ALL

01:15:56.785 --> 01:15:58.220
WILL THEY WEREN'T HURT.

01:15:58.287 --> 01:15:59.021
WELL IT ANYBODY IN AGRICULTURE

01:15:59.087 --> 01:15:59.955
KNOWS IF IN THE YEARS WHEN YOU

01:16:00.022 --> 01:16:01.123
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SOME

01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:02.724
MONEY YOU BETTER MAKE THE MONEY.

01:16:02.791 --> 01:16:04.092
BECAUSE THE NEXT YEAR YOU'RE

01:16:04.159 --> 01:16:05.627
GOING TO BE MAKING UP FOR LOSSES

01:16:05.694 --> 01:16:07.162
IN THIS IS A YEAR WHEN WE COULD

01:16:07.229 --> 01:16:09.398
HAVE HAD SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES

01:16:09.464 --> 01:16:11.466
IN THE SPECIAL PRICES.

01:16:11.533 --> 01:16:12.935
INSTEAD THEY'VE SORT OF BEEN

01:16:13.001 --> 01:16:13.568
STABLE.

01:16:13.635 --> 01:16:15.837
SO MAYBE SOMEBODY AT USDA IS

01:16:15.904 --> 01:16:17.406
LOOKING AT THAT AND SAYING HEY

01:16:17.472 --> 01:16:18.874
YOU GUYS AND POSSESSIONS YOU

01:16:18.941 --> 01:16:20.642
DIDN'T HAVE ANY LOSSES YOU SOLD

01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:21.944
THE CROP OF COURSE THEY SOLD

01:16:22.010 --> 01:16:22.878
PROP THEY HAD TO IT'S NOT.

01:16:22.945 --> 01:16:24.746
THIS ISN'T SOYBEANS AND CORN YOU

01:16:24.813 --> 01:16:26.348
CAN'T JUST STORED FOR YEARS.

01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:27.983
SO THEY SOLD THE CROP THEY

01:16:28.050 --> 01:16:29.484
DIDN'T GET A LOWER PRICE THAN

01:16:29.551 --> 01:16:31.620
LAST YEAR BUT WHAT THEY LOST WAS

01:16:31.687 --> 01:16:33.855
THE BUT FOR THEY REALLY NEEDED

01:16:33.922 --> 01:16:34.957
TO MAKE THE HIGH.

01:16:35.023 --> 01:16:36.792
UP PRICES THIS YEAR TO MAKE UP

01:16:36.858 --> 01:16:40.262
FOR THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY

01:16:40.329 --> 01:16:42.631
WERE FACING EARLIER.

01:16:42.698 --> 01:16:44.066
LET ME OF FINISHED IN WITH JUST

01:16:44.132 --> 01:16:45.300
A THREE FINAL REMARKS WE'VE

01:16:45.367 --> 01:16:46.168
ALREADY HEARD THE ILLUSION THE

01:16:46.234 --> 01:16:49.071
USDA HAS ANNOUNCED OF SOME

01:16:49.137 --> 01:16:51.039
COMPENSATION FOR GROWERS MOSTLY

01:16:51.106 --> 01:16:52.474
ORDERED ORIENTED TOWARDS THE

01:16:52.541 --> 01:16:56.745
MIDWEST THE GRAIN -- SOYBEANS AW.

01:16:56.812 --> 01:16:57.713
THE GROWERS THAT HAVE

01:16:57.779 --> 01:16:59.614
TRADITIONALLY GOTTEN USDA

01:16:59.681 --> 01:17:01.550
SUBSIDIES WELL MOST CALIFORNIA

01:17:01.616 --> 01:17:03.118
COMMODITIES ON IN THAT CATEGORY

01:17:03.185 --> 01:17:05.253
MOST OF OUR COMMODITIES HAVE NOT

01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:06.221
TRADITIONALLY GOTTEN THE

01:17:06.288 --> 01:17:06.922
SUBSIDIES.

01:17:06.989 --> 01:17:08.590
U. S. DOT D. A. DOESN'T KNOW THE

01:17:08.657 --> 01:17:10.158
NAME AND ADDRESS OF EVERY A

01:17:10.225 --> 01:17:11.893
GROWER IN CALIFORNIA LIKE THEY

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:13.295
WOULD FOR A CORN GROWER OR

01:17:13.362 --> 01:17:14.830
SOYBEAN GROWER.

01:17:14.896 --> 01:17:16.164
THAT MAKES IT HARDER AND IT MADE

01:17:16.231 --> 01:17:17.265
MEN'S OUR GROWERS HAVE GOTTEN

01:17:17.332 --> 01:17:20.102
MUCH LESS RELATIVE TO THE SIZE

01:17:20.168 --> 01:17:21.803
OF THEIR LOSSES.

01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:22.604
UP THERE.

01:17:22.671 --> 01:17:24.072
TO YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY CALIFORNIA

01:17:24.139 --> 01:17:26.074
AGRICULTURE IS BEEN WORKING IN

01:17:26.141 --> 01:17:27.743
WASHINGTON TRYING TO FIX THAT.

01:17:27.809 --> 01:17:29.277
AND WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT THE NEXT

01:17:29.344 --> 01:17:32.280
ROUND WILL FIX SOME OF THAT --

01:17:32.347 --> 01:17:34.716
IN TERMS OF COMPENSATION AND

01:17:34.783 --> 01:17:35.717
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE YOU

01:17:35.784 --> 01:17:39.187
FOLKS CAN ALL DO SUPPORT OF OUR

01:17:39.254 --> 01:17:40.789
INDUSTRIES IN THEIR EFFORTS IN

01:17:40.856 --> 01:17:42.791
WASHINGTON EITHER THROUGH OUR OF

01:17:42.858 --> 01:17:44.226
FEDERAL DELEGATIONS OR OR

01:17:44.292 --> 01:17:45.494
SOMEHOW.

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:47.629
OF THE OTHER THING -- I I WANT

01:17:47.696 --> 01:17:49.765
TO SAY IS IS.

01:17:49.831 --> 01:17:51.099
THAT ARM.

01:17:51.166 --> 01:17:52.167
THE BASIC PRINCIPLE ABOUT

01:17:52.234 --> 01:17:53.602
PROSPERITY FOR INTERNATIONAL

01:17:53.668 --> 01:17:55.637
TRADE IS STABILITY AND SO

01:17:55.704 --> 01:17:57.339
ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO RE

01:17:57.406 --> 01:17:59.674
ESTABLISH THAT STABILITY I THINK

01:17:59.741 --> 01:18:01.977
IS A CRUCIAL THING AND AND I

01:18:02.044 --> 01:18:08.450
GAVE THE ILLUSTRATION OF OF

01:18:08.517 --> 01:18:09.451
INSTABILITY CREATING BY JUST.

01:18:09.518 --> 01:18:10.819
THREATENING TO DO THINGS AND THE

01:18:10.886 --> 01:18:12.220
MORE WE CAN -- GET AWAY FROM

01:18:12.287 --> 01:18:13.321
THAT OF THE BETTER.

01:18:13.388 --> 01:18:14.790
AND THE FINAL THING I'LL SAY IS

01:18:14.856 --> 01:18:16.558
NONE OF THIS -- SHOULD BE

01:18:16.625 --> 01:18:20.796
UNDERSTOOD AS SAYING -- THE

01:18:20.862 --> 01:18:22.464
CHINA HAS BEEN BLAMELESS FOR

01:18:22.531 --> 01:18:24.266
EXAMPLE A NO I I'VE NEVER HEARD

01:18:24.332 --> 01:18:26.635
ANYONE SAY NO NOBODY IN BUSINESS

01:18:26.701 --> 01:18:27.369
NOT NOT.

01:18:27.436 --> 01:18:29.771
NOT THE MEMBERS OF THE OF THE

01:18:29.838 --> 01:18:31.339
ELECTED COMMUNITY SAYING ALL

01:18:31.406 --> 01:18:33.008
WHILE TRYING TO SHOULD GET A

01:18:33.075 --> 01:18:34.609
FREE RIDE THERE OKAY.

01:18:34.676 --> 01:18:36.678
BUT WHAT I WILL SAY IS WE HAVE

01:18:36.745 --> 01:18:38.280
WELL ESTABLISHED IN FACT

01:18:38.346 --> 01:18:40.215
AFFECTED INSTITUTIONS FOR

01:18:40.282 --> 01:18:42.417
DEALING WITH A PEOPLE THAT

01:18:42.484 --> 01:18:44.853
VIOLATE TRADE AGREEMENTS.

01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:48.790
IN THE W. T. O. IS INEFFECTIVE.

01:18:48.857 --> 01:18:51.159
INSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES

01:18:51.226 --> 01:18:53.528
JUST ONE TWO MAJOR TRADE CASES

01:18:53.595 --> 01:18:56.031
AGAINST CHINA THEY'LL APPEAL

01:18:56.098 --> 01:18:57.766
WILL WIN THE APPEALS.

01:18:57.833 --> 01:18:59.434
AND WE WILL BE THEN HAVE THE

01:18:59.501 --> 01:19:01.903
WHOLE WORLD BEHIND US IN

01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:02.971
BRINGING SANCTIONS AGAINST CHINA

01:19:03.038 --> 01:19:05.474
ON THOSE TWO AGRICULTURAL CASES.

01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:07.442
AND I WOULD HOPE THAT IS NOT TOO

01:19:07.509 --> 01:19:10.312
LATE. TO TAKE A STEP BACK IN USE

01:19:10.378 --> 01:19:12.280
THE OF THE INSTITUTIONS THAT

01:19:12.347 --> 01:19:14.082
WE'VE ESTABLISHED OVER THE YEARS

01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:15.083
FOR SETTLING DISPUTES NO LEGAL

01:19:15.150 --> 01:19:17.119
WAY AND THAT WAY WE WOULD HAVE

01:19:17.185 --> 01:19:17.552
NOT.

01:19:17.619 --> 01:19:19.020
THE U. S. GOING ALONE AND

01:19:19.087 --> 01:19:20.789
EVERYBODY ELSE AGAINST US BUT

01:19:20.856 --> 01:19:22.557
THE U. S. TOGETHER WITH LOTS OF

01:19:22.624 --> 01:19:24.059
OTHER COUNTRIES THAT ACTUALLY DO

01:19:24.126 --> 01:19:25.227
AGREE WITH THIS.

01:19:25.293 --> 01:19:28.563
ANA ON CONCERNS ABOUT CHINESE

01:19:28.630 --> 01:19:30.232
TRADE BETTER.

01:19:30.298 --> 01:19:31.867
LET ME STOP THERE SORRY THANK

01:19:31.933 --> 01:19:33.835
YOU SO MUCH DOCTOR SUMNER AND

01:19:33.902 --> 01:19:36.371
WILL GO TO A DOCTOR RUSS BEFORE

01:19:36.438 --> 01:19:37.906
WE THEN CRY ABOUT OUR ONE THAT'S

01:19:37.973 --> 01:19:40.008
A LITTLE BIT MORE -- AND AND TO

01:19:40.075 --> 01:19:41.877
GET GO -- A LITTLE BIT MORE ON

01:19:41.943 --> 01:19:45.680
THOSE ISSUES DOCTOR US THANK YOU.

01:19:45.747 --> 01:19:46.882
SO THANKS VERY MUCH TO THE

01:19:46.948 --> 01:19:48.016
SELECT COMMITTEE IN THE STATE

01:19:48.083 --> 01:19:49.818
STANDING COMMITTEES FOR GIVING

01:19:49.885 --> 01:19:50.819
ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH

01:19:50.886 --> 01:19:53.655
YOU TODAY ON THE U. S. CHINA

01:19:53.722 --> 01:19:57.292
TERROR -- FOR I'D LIKE SO I HOPE

01:19:57.359 --> 01:19:58.126
YOU CAN HEAR ME I HAVE A LITTLE

01:19:58.193 --> 01:20:01.796
BIT OF US OKAY GREAT -- TO THERE

01:20:01.863 --> 01:20:04.599
ARE THREE AREAS WHERE -- I WAS

01:20:04.666 --> 01:20:07.135
ASKED TO COMMENT TODAY ON THE

01:20:07.202 --> 01:20:08.436
IMPACT OF THE TERRACE.

01:20:08.503 --> 01:20:11.072
BOB FIRST ON CONSUMERS SO AS THE

01:20:11.139 --> 01:20:12.174
TEN GOVERNOR **** **** AKIS

01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:13.642
EXPLAINS AND REALLY HELPFUL

01:20:13.708 --> 01:20:16.511
DETAIL THERE IS CURRENTLY A 25%

01:20:16.578 --> 01:20:18.246
TAX ON ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND

01:20:18.313 --> 01:20:19.714
FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF

01:20:19.781 --> 01:20:21.349
GOODS FROM CHINA.

01:20:21.416 --> 01:20:22.918
AS THEY CROSS THE BORDER INTO

01:20:22.984 --> 01:20:24.286
THE UNITED STATES.

01:20:24.352 --> 01:20:26.555
OF FEASIBLE RANGE OF COSTS FOR

01:20:26.621 --> 01:20:28.523
THE AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD JUST FOR

01:20:28.590 --> 01:20:30.559
THE COST OF THESE TAXES NOT THE

01:20:30.625 --> 01:20:33.028
DISTORTIONS THAT THEY GENERATE.

01:20:33.094 --> 01:20:35.430
IS BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED AND

01:20:35.497 --> 01:20:35.997
EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS WITH

01:20:36.064 --> 01:20:37.666
EITHER -- FIVE HUNDRED BEING A

01:20:37.732 --> 01:20:39.334
FOCAL POINT -- THAT ACTUALLY

01:20:39.401 --> 01:20:41.236
FELL INTO THE ESTIMATES OF

01:20:41.303 --> 01:20:42.103
SEVERAL STUDIES.

01:20:42.170 --> 01:20:44.472
AND THE COST OF THESE TARIFFS

01:20:44.539 --> 01:20:46.441
YOU CAN THINK OF IS SIMILAR TO A

01:20:46.508 --> 01:20:48.443
SORT OF HIDDEN SALES TAX.

01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:52.948
BETWEEN ONE HALF AND 1% -- BUT

01:20:53.014 --> 01:20:54.149
IT'S NOTSPREAD EVENLY ACROSS

01:20:54.216 --> 01:20:55.850
GOODS LIKE A SALES TAX WOULD BE

01:20:55.917 --> 01:21:00.288
SO IT TENDS TO BE MORE

01:21:00.355 --> 01:21:01.856
DISTORTION. FOR THAT REASON.

01:21:01.923 --> 01:21:03.258
NGUYEN ECONOMIST FACTOR IN THE

01:21:03.325 --> 01:21:04.226
HANG UPS INVOLVED IN CONSUMERS

01:21:04.292 --> 01:21:06.561
HAVING TO SUBSTITUTE AWAY FROM

01:21:06.628 --> 01:21:08.296
GOODS THAT THEY LIKE TOWARD

01:21:08.363 --> 01:21:09.698
GOODS THAT THEY LIKE LESS AND

01:21:09.764 --> 01:21:11.299
SOURCE FROM LESS EFFICIENT

01:21:11.366 --> 01:21:12.601
PRODUCERS WE GET THESE.

01:21:12.667 --> 01:21:15.003
DEAD WEIGHT LOSSES -- THAT

01:21:15.070 --> 01:21:15.971
THAT'S WHAT WE CALL THESE

01:21:16.037 --> 01:21:17.239
EFFICIENCY LOSSES IN PUBLIC

01:21:17.305 --> 01:21:19.541
FINANCE THOSE COULD BE TWO TO

01:21:19.608 --> 01:21:21.409
THREE TIMES JUST THE COST OF THE

01:21:21.476 --> 01:21:22.744
TAXES THEMSELVES.

01:21:22.811 --> 01:21:24.512
SO THE COST FOR THE AVERAGE

01:21:24.579 --> 01:21:26.014
HOUSEHOLD IF YOU FACTOR THOSE IN

01:21:26.081 --> 01:21:29.284
COULD BE QUITE ENORMOUS -- IN

01:21:29.351 --> 01:21:31.486
TERMS OF JOBS SO CHINA IS THE

01:21:31.553 --> 01:21:34.055
DESTINATION FOR NEARLY 10% OF

01:21:34.122 --> 01:21:36.057
CALIFORNIA'S EXPORTS -- THERE

01:21:36.124 --> 01:21:38.727
ARE MORE THAN FIFTY THREE

01:21:38.793 --> 01:21:40.895
THOUSAND JOBS AND TWENTY FIVE

01:21:40.962 --> 01:21:41.830
HUNDRED BUSINESSES LOCATED IN

01:21:41.896 --> 01:21:43.198
CALIFORNIA.

01:21:43.265 --> 01:21:44.699
THAT MAY BE PARTICULARLY

01:21:44.766 --> 01:21:46.868
VULNERABLE TO RETALIATORY

01:21:46.935 --> 01:21:49.337
TARIFFS BY CHINA DUE TO THE FACT

01:21:49.404 --> 01:21:52.207
THAT CHINA IS THE DESTINATION

01:21:52.274 --> 01:21:53.608
FOR MORE THAN 20% OF THEIR

01:21:53.675 --> 01:21:55.910
INDUSTRIES EXPORTS TO THE WORLD

01:21:55.977 --> 01:21:58.280
SO CHINA'S A MAJOR EXPORT MARKET

01:21:58.346 --> 01:22:00.815
FOR THEIR INDUSTRIES -- TO IT

01:22:00.882 --> 01:22:02.784
SOON SO THAT'S ONE REASON WHY

01:22:02.851 --> 01:22:04.686
SOME INDUSTRIES MAYBE VULNERABLE

01:22:04.753 --> 01:22:06.321
BECAUSE CHINA'S A MAJOR MARKET.

01:22:06.388 --> 01:22:08.456
ANOTHER REASON WHY SOME

01:22:08.523 --> 01:22:09.624
INDUSTRIES MAY BE MORE

01:22:09.691 --> 01:22:10.659
VULNERABLE THAN OTHERS IS

01:22:10.725 --> 01:22:12.227
BECAUSE CHINA'S RETALIATORY

01:22:12.294 --> 01:22:14.095
TERRAFORMED THEIR GOODS IS

01:22:14.162 --> 01:22:17.966
TWENTY OR 25% INSTEAD OF 0025%.

01:22:18.033 --> 01:22:19.434
SO -- IF WE LOOK AT INDUSTRIES

01:22:19.501 --> 01:22:20.535
THAT MIGHT BE PARTICULARLY

01:22:20.602 --> 01:22:21.970
VULNERABLE FOR ONE OF THESE

01:22:22.037 --> 01:22:24.906
REASONS -- THEY INCLUDE -- WOOD

01:22:24.973 --> 01:22:26.841
PRODUCTS A LOGGING AND TIMBER --

01:22:26.908 --> 01:22:29.811
AGRICULTURE AS PROFESSOR SUMNER --

01:22:29.878 --> 01:22:32.013
EXPLAINED IN X. JUST BEAUTIFUL

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:33.748
DETAIL -- FISH AND MARINE

01:22:33.815 --> 01:22:35.817
PRODUCTS OIL AND GAS MINING AND

01:22:35.884 --> 01:22:37.919
QUARYING INDUSTRIAL MACHINERY

01:22:37.986 --> 01:22:39.954
AND MOTOR VEHICLE RELATED

01:22:40.021 --> 01:22:42.257
MANUFACTURING COSMETICS AND SKIN

01:22:42.324 --> 01:22:45.460
CARE AND WINE AND SPIRITS AS IS

01:22:45.527 --> 01:22:47.796
IN YOUR BACKGROUND REPORT -- THE

01:22:47.862 --> 01:22:50.732
BALANCE OF JOBS CREATED IN

01:22:50.799 --> 01:22:53.168
INDUSTRIES THAT ARE PROTECTED BY

01:22:53.234 --> 01:22:54.102
THE TERRACE BECAUSE SOME

01:22:54.169 --> 01:22:55.337
INDUSTRIES ACTUALLY ARE

01:22:55.403 --> 01:22:57.072
PROTECTED BY THE TERRACE AND

01:22:57.138 --> 01:22:58.106
BECAUSE THEY'RE ABLE TO RAISE

01:22:58.173 --> 01:22:59.541
THEIR PRICES UNDER THIS

01:22:59.607 --> 01:23:00.942
PROTECTION FROM.

01:23:01.009 --> 01:23:03.244
COMPETITORS IN CHINA OR

01:23:03.311 --> 01:23:04.946
ELSEWHERE DEPENDING ON THE

01:23:05.013 --> 01:23:06.614
TARIFF IN PLACE THEY CAN

01:23:06.681 --> 01:23:09.617
SOMETIMES EXPAND -- EMPLOYMENT

01:23:09.684 --> 01:23:11.386
BUT THE BALANCE OF JOBS CREATED

01:23:11.453 --> 01:23:13.421
IN THESE PROTECTED INDUSTRIES

01:23:13.488 --> 01:23:15.924
VERSES JOBS LOST IN CONTRACTING

01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:18.860
INDUSTRIES TENDS TO BE --

01:23:18.927 --> 01:23:21.062
NEGATIVE IN THE ESTIMATES THAT

01:23:21.129 --> 01:23:23.164
I'VE SEEN SO FAR I HAVEN'T SEEN

01:23:23.231 --> 01:23:24.632
ESTIMATES IN PARTICULAR FOR

01:23:24.699 --> 01:23:26.501
CALIFORNIA YET BUT FOR THE

01:23:26.568 --> 01:23:31.906
COUNTRY AS A WHOLE NATIONALLY --

01:23:31.973 --> 01:23:32.474
I'VE SEEN ANYWHERE FROM A

01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:35.477
HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND

01:23:35.543 --> 01:23:36.277
TO NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND JOBS AS

01:23:36.344 --> 01:23:38.613
A NET LOSS SO BILL NET LOSS OF

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:42.650
UNDER 552-900-1000 -- JOBS JUST

01:23:42.717 --> 01:23:44.853
FOR THE CURRENT TERRACE SO NOT

01:23:44.919 --> 01:23:46.054
FOR THE TERRACE OF THEIR

01:23:46.121 --> 01:23:49.391
EXPANDED -- TO MORE PRODUCTS.

01:23:49.457 --> 01:23:50.992
TERMS OF GDP THE TERRORISTS ARE

01:23:51.059 --> 01:23:53.027
LIKELY TO SHRINK THE SIZE OF THE

01:23:53.094 --> 01:23:55.597
US ECONOMY AND BE A HEAD WIND

01:23:55.663 --> 01:23:56.898
FOR U. S. GDP GROWTH.

01:23:56.965 --> 01:23:59.334
THE NONPARTISAN TAX FOUNDATION

01:23:59.401 --> 01:24:00.668
ESTIMATES THE CURRENT TERRACE

01:24:00.735 --> 01:24:02.837
WILL SHRINK THE OVERALL SIZE OF

01:24:02.904 --> 01:24:05.073
THE US ECONOMY OF WHICH AS YOU

01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:07.842
KNOW CALIFORNIA IS A HUGE PART.

01:24:07.909 --> 01:24:09.411
BY FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS.

01:24:09.477 --> 01:24:11.179
THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF NEW

YORK LIBERTY STREET BLOG

01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:15.850
PUBLISHED ESTIMATES BASED ON ONE

01:24:15.917 --> 01:24:16.951
OF THE BEST THEY JUST TOP

01:24:17.018 --> 01:24:19.187
QUALITY ACADEMIC STUDIES ON THE

01:24:19.254 --> 01:24:21.122
TOPIC -- SUGGESTING THAT

01:24:21.189 --> 01:24:22.390
TERRORISTS COULD SHRINK THE SIZE

01:24:22.457 --> 01:24:24.626
OF THE US ECONOMY BY NINETY FIVE

01:24:24.692 --> 01:24:26.461
BILLION DOLLARS THESE ARE ONLY

01:24:26.528 --> 01:24:27.996
THE TERRACE IN PLACE RIGHT NOW.

01:24:28.062 --> 01:24:30.165
AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF THAT

01:24:30.231 --> 01:24:31.399
NINETY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS

01:24:31.466 --> 01:24:33.668
ACTUALLY CAME FROM EFFICIENCY

01:24:33.735 --> 01:24:36.404
DISTORTIONS JUST FROM THIS LAST

01:24:36.471 --> 01:24:38.473
ROUND OF THE INCREASED TARIFFS

01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:39.808
ON THE CHINESE GOODS.

01:24:39.874 --> 01:24:41.276
THAT -- THE TANK GOVERNOR COULD

01:24:41.342 --> 01:24:42.977
NOT GUESS MENTIONED ON THE TWO

01:24:43.044 --> 01:24:44.446
HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF

01:24:44.512 --> 01:24:46.080
CHINESE IMPORTS FOR RAISING THE

01:24:46.147 --> 01:24:48.783
TERROR FROM 10225% JUST THAT.

01:24:48.850 --> 01:24:51.219
KNOCKED ON KNOCKED UP THIS

01:24:51.286 --> 01:24:52.987
ESTIMATE OF THE HIT TO THE US

01:24:53.054 --> 01:24:57.158
ECONOMY BY -- ALMOST EIGHTY

01:24:57.225 --> 01:24:58.293
BILLION DOLLARS.

01:24:58.359 --> 01:25:00.261
AT CHINA ACCOUNTS FOR ONE THIRD

01:25:00.328 --> 01:25:01.963
OF GLOBAL GROWTH.

01:25:02.030 --> 01:25:04.466
AND THIS IS -- AND CHINA IS ALSO

01:25:04.532 --> 01:25:06.167
AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF DEMANDS

01:25:06.234 --> 01:25:07.502
FOR A LOT OF DEVELOPING

01:25:07.569 --> 01:25:09.037
COUTRIES COMMODITY EXPORTING

01:25:09.103 --> 01:25:09.971
COUNTRIES.

01:25:10.038 --> 01:25:11.673
SO ANY SLOWING IN CHINA'S

01:25:11.739 --> 01:25:14.375
ECONOMY COULD GENERATE HAD WINS

01:25:14.442 --> 01:25:15.877
FOR U. S. G. D. P. GROWTH

01:25:15.944 --> 01:25:17.212
THROUGH ITS AFFECT ON GLOBAL

01:25:17.278 --> 01:25:19.547
GROWTH AND OUR EXPORT MARKETS

01:25:19.614 --> 01:25:20.348
ELSEWHERE [inaudible]

01:25:20.415 --> 01:25:22.784
THANK YOU.

01:25:22.851 --> 01:25:23.885
DOCTOR US THANK YOU I WANT TO

01:25:23.952 --> 01:25:24.953
INTRODUCE A CELL NUMBER BOERNER

01:25:25.019 --> 01:25:26.488
HORVATH YOU JUST JOINEDUS THANK

01:25:26.554 --> 01:25:29.290
YOU FOR COMING AND IN YOU JUST

01:25:29.357 --> 01:25:30.892
TOUCHED UPON SOMETHING THAT A

01:25:30.959 --> 01:25:31.726
LOT OF PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED

01:25:31.793 --> 01:25:33.962
ABOUT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DATA.

01:25:34.028 --> 01:25:36.564
COMING OUT -- DATA IS INDICATIVE

01:25:36.631 --> 01:25:39.234
OF A OF A NEAR TERM RECESSION SO

01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:42.103
THAT'S NOT TOO FAR AWAY AND

01:25:42.170 --> 01:25:43.638
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT NUMBERS

01:25:43.705 --> 01:25:46.007
THAT SHRINK JOBS AND SHRINK OUR

01:25:46.074 --> 01:25:47.408
OVERALL ECONOMY.

01:25:47.475 --> 01:25:52.013
ALL OF THAT SEEMS TO HASTEN A AT

01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:53.882
ANY ECONOMIC DOWNTURN THAT WOULD

01:25:53.948 --> 01:25:56.117
BE RECESSIONARY CAN YOU TALK A

01:25:56.184 --> 01:25:57.252
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT KIND OF

01:25:57.318 --> 01:25:59.120
HOW QUICKLY THOSE NUMBERS COULD

01:25:59.187 --> 01:26:00.822
BECOME REALITY.

01:26:00.889 --> 01:26:04.592
OR ARE THEY PROJECTED HOW HOW

01:26:04.659 --> 01:26:06.094
SOON WOULD WILL WE FEEL THAT.

01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:08.263
IT'S HARD TO ESTIMATE EXACTLY

01:26:08.329 --> 01:26:10.231
WHAT THE TIMING OF THESE

01:26:10.298 --> 01:26:12.000
CONTRACTIONS WOULD BE IN PART

01:26:12.066 --> 01:26:14.536
BECAUSE OF THE TIMING ISSUE THAT

01:26:14.602 --> 01:26:16.337
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR CARACAS AND

01:26:16.404 --> 01:26:17.705
PROFESSOR SUMNER MENTIONED.

01:26:17.772 --> 01:26:19.140
BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY SOME

01:26:19.207 --> 01:26:20.575
OF THE CONTRACTION IS ALREADY

01:26:20.642 --> 01:26:22.544
HAPPENING IN TERMS OF DAMPENING

01:26:22.610 --> 01:26:27.682
INVESTMENT -- I I CAN TELL YOU

01:26:27.749 --> 01:26:30.251
THAT -- EVEN YESTERDAY MAJOR

01:26:30.318 --> 01:26:31.986
FORECASTERS IN THE PRIVATE

01:26:32.053 --> 01:26:33.321
SECTOR WERE COMING OUT KNOCKING

01:26:33.388 --> 01:26:34.622
HALF PERCENT OFF OF THEIR

01:26:34.689 --> 01:26:35.957
PREDICTIONS FOR U. S. GROWTH

01:26:36.024 --> 01:26:38.860
SHOULD THAT TERROR FOR CONTINUE

01:26:38.927 --> 01:26:40.061
OR WORSEN.

01:26:40.128 --> 01:26:41.296
OUT WE'VE ALSO SEEN DOWNWARD

01:26:41.362 --> 01:26:43.431
REVISIONS IN FORECASTED GROWTH

01:26:43.498 --> 01:26:46.668
FOR THE GLOBAL ECONOMY BY THE I

01:26:46.734 --> 01:26:46.901
AM MATH.

01:26:46.968 --> 01:26:47.835
SO.

01:26:47.902 --> 01:26:49.203
I I BELIEVE THAT WE'RE ALREADY

01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:51.973
SEEING SOME DRAG IT'S HARD TO

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:54.008
SEE IT BECAUSE PROFESSOR SUMNER

01:26:54.075 --> 01:26:55.643
WAS TALKING ABOUT THE COUNTER

01:26:55.710 --> 01:26:58.079
FACTUAL WITH -- PISTACHIO PRICES

01:26:58.146 --> 01:27:00.415
RIGHT SO WE'VE BEEN IN A

01:27:00.481 --> 01:27:03.284
RECOVERY FOR I MEAN WE'VE BEEN

01:27:03.351 --> 01:27:04.586
IN RECOVERY -- FOR BASICALLY TEN

01:27:04.652 --> 01:27:06.921
YEARS NOW AND SO WE'VE BEEN ON

01:27:06.988 --> 01:27:10.158
THIS UPSWING AND SO IT'S IT'S

01:27:10.224 --> 01:27:11.392
HARD FOR PEOPLE TO SEE THE HEAD

01:27:11.459 --> 01:27:13.928
WINDS THAT ARE KIND OF DAMPENING.

01:27:13.995 --> 01:27:15.597
BUT THE GROWTH THAT WE MIGHT SEE

01:27:15.663 --> 01:27:18.232
WITHOUT THE UNCERTAINTY AND THE

01:27:18.299 --> 01:27:19.367
DISTORTIONS OF TARIFFS.

01:27:19.434 --> 01:27:22.003
ARE HAVING THEIR IMPACT ON THE

01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:23.938
ECONOMY.

01:27:24.005 --> 01:27:25.773
I DO AT OTHER MEMBERS HAVE ANY

01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:30.345
QUESTIONS AT THIS POINT BACK TO

01:27:30.411 --> 01:27:32.413
THE ISSUE AROUND -- FARMWORKERS

01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:34.582
BOTH AS WORKERS BUT THEN ALSO ON

01:27:34.649 --> 01:27:36.451
THE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY IT

01:27:36.517 --> 01:27:38.252
SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A THE DOUBLE

01:27:38.319 --> 01:27:39.887
WHAMMY RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE TO

01:27:39.954 --> 01:27:43.358
TERRACE IN ADDITION.

01:27:43.424 --> 01:27:44.626
TO THE CHAOS AT THE BORDER WHERE.

01:27:44.692 --> 01:27:45.727
AND AND EVERYTHING I'VE HEARD IS

01:27:45.793 --> 01:27:47.462
THAT YOUR BAG COMMITTEE IS ABOUT

01:27:47.528 --> 01:27:48.963
THE PROBLEM OF BEING ABLE TO

01:27:49.030 --> 01:27:50.632
FIND ENOUGH LABOR RIGHT NOW --

01:27:50.698 --> 01:27:53.568
TO CAN YOU COMMENT ON THE THOSE

01:27:53.635 --> 01:27:54.168
TWO THINGS COMING TOGETHER AT

01:27:54.235 --> 01:27:55.703
THE SAME TIME.

01:27:55.770 --> 01:27:57.238
THERE'S CERTAINLY NO QUESTION

01:27:57.305 --> 01:27:59.407
THAT DOG GROWERS HAVE A HARD

01:27:59.474 --> 01:28:02.276
TIME FINDING WORKERS -- BUT

01:28:02.343 --> 01:28:03.711
DURING CERTAIN TIMES OF THE YEAR

01:28:03.778 --> 01:28:05.113
WHEN THEY'RE CERTAIN TASKS AND

01:28:05.179 --> 01:28:06.014
END.

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:10.652
UP WHAT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE IS --

01:28:10.718 --> 01:28:13.054
A FARMWORKERS A TYPICALLY HAVE A

01:28:13.121 --> 01:28:14.589
HARD TIME PUTTING TOGETHER MORE

01:28:14.656 --> 01:28:16.624
THAN A HUNDRED AND FORTY HUNDRED

01:28:16.691 --> 01:28:17.825
FIFTY DAYS A YEAR OF WORK EVEN

01:28:17.892 --> 01:28:19.827
IF THEY'RE WORKING FULL TIME

01:28:19.894 --> 01:28:20.828
FIFTEEN HUNDRED HOURS IS.

01:28:20.895 --> 01:28:24.565
IS IT BECAUSE OF WINS ONE

01:28:24.632 --> 01:28:25.833
FARMERS HIRING AN AREA

01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:27.068
EVERYBODY'S HIRING IN THAT AREA

01:28:27.135 --> 01:28:28.836
AND THEN YOU FEEL THE SHORTAGE

01:28:28.903 --> 01:28:30.538
OF WORKERS IN AT THAT TIME.

01:28:30.605 --> 01:28:32.073
EVERYBODY CAN WORK.

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:33.941
AND IT BUT IT'S IT'S ON THE

01:28:34.008 --> 01:28:35.043
EDGES OF THAT WHEN THE

01:28:35.109 --> 01:28:36.911
FARMWORKERS ARE SCRAMBLING

01:28:36.978 --> 01:28:38.413
TRYING TRYING TO GET JOBS.

01:28:38.479 --> 01:28:39.914
AND SO THESE THINGS CAN EXIST AT

01:28:39.981 --> 01:28:41.582
THE SAME TIME IT CAN BE

01:28:41.649 --> 01:28:43.785
CERTAINLY THE CASE THAT -- HERE

01:28:43.851 --> 01:28:44.786
HERE AND WINTERS CALIFORNIA

01:28:44.852 --> 01:28:46.287
THERE CERTAIN TIMES WHEN THE THE

01:28:46.354 --> 01:28:47.989
GROWERS ARE SAYING GEE I WISH I

01:28:48.056 --> 01:28:49.257
COULD FIND MORE WORKERS.

01:28:49.323 --> 01:28:50.825
A MONTH LATER THE WORKERS ARE

01:28:50.892 --> 01:28:52.460
SAYING I WISH I COULD FIND A JOB

01:28:52.527 --> 01:28:54.328
AND THAT'S THE SEASONAL NATURE

01:28:54.395 --> 01:28:56.898
OF AGRICULTURE SO -- I THINK OF

01:28:56.964 --> 01:28:58.032
BOTH OF THOSE THINGS ARE GOING

01:28:58.099 --> 01:29:00.034
ON WE DON'T KNOW THAT HIRED FARM

01:29:00.101 --> 01:29:01.669
WORKER WAGES HAVE BEEN GOING UP

01:29:01.736 --> 01:29:03.604
GRADUALLY IN CALIFORNIA FOR A

01:29:03.671 --> 01:29:04.472
WHILE.

01:29:04.539 --> 01:29:05.640
AND THAT SOMETHING THAT'S

01:29:05.707 --> 01:29:07.709
POSITIVE AND AND I THINK FOR

01:29:07.775 --> 01:29:10.311
WORKERS IN GROWERS FRANKLY EVERY

01:29:10.378 --> 01:29:12.246
DRAWER I'VE EVER TALKED TO SAID

01:29:12.313 --> 01:29:14.549
I WISH I COULD PAY HIGHER WAGES

01:29:14.615 --> 01:29:16.050
I WOULD LIKE TO PAY HIGHER WAGES.

01:29:16.117 --> 01:29:17.485
BUT THE MARKET REALITIES MAKE

01:29:17.552 --> 01:29:18.653
THAT HARD.

01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:20.288
IN HAVING THESE KIND OF TERROR

01:29:20.354 --> 01:29:22.190
OF SIN PLACE THE DAMPEN PRICES

01:29:22.256 --> 01:29:23.658
MAKE IT THAT MUCH HARDER ON THE

01:29:23.725 --> 01:29:25.860
GROWERS.

01:29:25.927 --> 01:29:29.163
AND UP SO SO I THINK IT'S IT'S

01:29:29.230 --> 01:29:30.531
IT'S TROUBLESOME THAT THESE ALL

01:29:30.598 --> 01:29:32.100
THESE ISSUES ARE THERE AT THE

01:29:32.166 --> 01:29:33.835
SAME TIME BUT I THINK WHAT I

01:29:33.901 --> 01:29:35.837
LIKE TO DO IS ALWAYS HIGHLIGHT

01:29:35.903 --> 01:29:37.538
YOU KNOW BECAUSE PEOPLE.

01:29:37.605 --> 01:29:38.439
CAN SAY ALL.

01:29:38.506 --> 01:29:39.874
SEE WE CAN TALK ABOUT BILLIONS

01:29:39.941 --> 01:29:42.043
OF DOLLARS OF HERE AND I DON'T

01:29:42.110 --> 01:29:43.377
KNOW WHAT A BILLION TIMES CLOSE

01:29:43.444 --> 01:29:45.213
IS FRANKLY I I CAN'T PICTURE IT.

01:29:45.279 --> 01:29:47.448
BUT IF SOMEBODY TELLS ME HERE'S

01:29:47.515 --> 01:29:48.783
A FAMILY THAT LOST HER JOB.

01:29:48.850 --> 01:29:50.685
A EVEN I CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT

01:29:50.752 --> 01:29:53.755
THAT MEANS IT IT AND WHEN I WAS

01:29:53.821 --> 01:29:55.690
I FOUND IT COMPELLING A FEW

01:29:55.757 --> 01:29:56.924
MONTHS AGO WHEN ONE OF THE WINE

01:29:56.991 --> 01:30:03.197
GROWERS DOWN IN THE LODI AREA

01:30:03.264 --> 01:30:05.099
WAS SAYING.

01:30:05.166 --> 01:30:06.033
THEY WERE PLANNING A NEW VENUE

01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:07.235
THEY WERE REPLACING A VINEYARD

01:30:07.301 --> 01:30:08.703
AND THEY THEY YOU STILL POST

01:30:08.770 --> 01:30:09.570
WHEN THEY PLANT VINEYARDS.

01:30:09.637 --> 01:30:10.972
IN THIS PARTICULAR VINEYARD --

01:30:11.038 --> 01:30:13.574
UP BETWEEN THE TIME THEY PLANTED

01:30:13.641 --> 01:30:15.409
TO WHEN THEY WERE GETTING READY

01:30:15.476 --> 01:30:18.179
TO DO IT THE TERRACE CAME ON FOR

01:30:18.246 --> 01:30:19.046
STEEL ALUMINUM.

01:30:19.113 --> 01:30:20.214
THE BILL THEY WERE GOING TO GET

01:30:20.281 --> 01:30:21.816
FROM THE STEEL GUY WAS FIFTY

01:30:21.883 --> 01:30:22.683
THOUSAND DOLLARS HIGHER WHERE I

01:30:22.750 --> 01:30:24.118
KNOW WHAT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:30:24.185 --> 01:30:25.386
LOOKS LIKE I MEAN I KNOW WHAT A

01:30:25.453 --> 01:30:26.788
BILLION LOOKS LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT.

01:30:26.854 --> 01:30:28.055
FIFTY SO HERE'S JUST A GUY IN A

01:30:28.122 --> 01:30:30.658
JUST A FAMILY AND THEY CHOSE NOT

01:30:30.725 --> 01:30:31.259
TO DO IT THEY SAID WELL MAYBE

01:30:31.325 --> 01:30:32.727
NEXT YEAR.

01:30:32.794 --> 01:30:34.495
WELL THERE WERE SOME WORKERS THE

01:30:34.562 --> 01:30:34.796
RATE TO GO.

01:30:34.862 --> 01:30:36.264
UP AND THEY COULDN'T DO IT

01:30:36.330 --> 01:30:37.999
BECAUSE OF THAT CASE IT WAS THE

01:30:38.065 --> 01:30:39.834
COST OF IMPORTS AND I REALLY

01:30:39.901 --> 01:30:42.737
LIKE THE FACT THAT THE WE WE

01:30:42.804 --> 01:30:45.273
THINK ABOUT THIS POST AS THE

01:30:45.339 --> 01:30:46.908
IMPORTS.

01:30:46.974 --> 01:30:48.276
TAXES THAT'S WHAT TERRACE ARE

01:30:48.342 --> 01:30:49.944
THE TAXES ON IMPORTS.

01:30:50.011 --> 01:30:51.479
ARE HURTING OUR ECONOMY.

01:30:51.546 --> 01:30:53.614
AND THE LACK OF EXPORT ACCESS

01:30:53.681 --> 01:30:54.882
HURTING OUR ECONOMY IT'S BOTH

01:30:54.949 --> 01:30:56.083
WAYS TRADE IS ACTUALLY.

01:30:56.150 --> 01:30:57.752
GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY AND

01:30:57.819 --> 01:30:59.387
PROFESSOR RUSS -- DID A VERY

01:30:59.453 --> 01:31:00.755
GOOD JOB OF HIGHLIGHTING THESE

01:31:00.822 --> 01:31:02.890
LOSSES AND WE COLUMN DEAD WEIGHT

01:31:02.957 --> 01:31:04.525
BECAUSE THEY'RE LIKE DRAGGING A

01:31:04.592 --> 01:31:06.027
DEAD WEIGHT FOR THE ECONOMY.

01:31:06.093 --> 01:31:08.996
AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING TO

01:31:09.063 --> 01:31:11.132
KEEP IN MIND.

01:31:11.199 --> 01:31:14.669
SO WE'VE GOT -- SUBSIDIES THAT

01:31:14.735 --> 01:31:18.072
REALLY BOOST MIDWEST GROWERS.

01:31:18.139 --> 01:31:20.308
REALLY MISSES OUT ON CALIFORNIA

01:31:20.374 --> 01:31:24.412
GROWERS BUT NOTHING ON THE HIT

01:31:24.478 --> 01:31:26.681
TO CONSUMERS MORE BROADLY.

01:31:26.747 --> 01:31:27.982
THE LOWER INCOME.

01:31:28.049 --> 01:31:30.618
CONSUMERS OF COURSE THE WORST

01:31:30.685 --> 01:31:32.320
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ON A FIFTY

01:31:32.386 --> 01:31:33.321
THOUSAND DOLLAR THIRTY THOUSAND

01:31:33.387 --> 01:31:34.288
DOLLAR INCOME IS A WHOLE LOT OF

01:31:34.355 --> 01:31:36.824
MONEY FOR PEOPLE -- ON A TWO

01:31:36.891 --> 01:31:37.425
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR

01:31:37.491 --> 01:31:39.126
INCOME PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT LESS

01:31:39.193 --> 01:31:41.362
PAINFUL -- WHAT WHAT WHAT WILL

01:31:41.429 --> 01:31:43.564
THOSE IMPACTS BE LIKE WILL

01:31:43.631 --> 01:31:44.232
PEOPLE BE ABLE?

01:31:44.298 --> 01:31:47.735
TO ON ON THOSE KIND OF LARGER.

01:31:47.802 --> 01:31:48.703
ACCURATE DATA.

01:31:48.769 --> 01:31:51.606
SAMPLES BE ABLE TO ABSORB FIVE

01:31:51.672 --> 01:31:53.908
HUNDRED DOLLARS OR WILL THIS

01:31:53.975 --> 01:31:56.711
DRAG PEOPLE FURTHER DOWN --

01:31:56.777 --> 01:31:59.447
ECONOMICALLY PEOPLE WHO PROBABLY

01:31:59.513 --> 01:32:00.648
HAVE LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED

01:32:00.715 --> 01:32:01.916
DOLLARS IN SAVINGS IN THEIR BANK

01:32:01.983 --> 01:32:04.018
ACCOUNT CAN'T HAVE ANY ECONOMIC

01:32:04.085 --> 01:32:04.952
EMERGENCY.

01:32:05.019 --> 01:32:07.488
IN IN THEIR LIVES WITHOUT --

01:32:07.555 --> 01:32:09.156
PERHAPS LOSING A CAR -- BECAUSE

01:32:09.223 --> 01:32:10.825
THEY CAN MAKE A CAR PAYMENT OR

01:32:10.892 --> 01:32:13.127
NOT BEING ABLE TO MAKE RENT --

01:32:13.194 --> 01:32:16.464
OR SOME OTHER VERY HARD CHOICE

01:32:16.530 --> 01:32:18.532
WHAT ON CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT AT

01:32:18.599 --> 01:32:19.233
ALL.

01:32:19.300 --> 01:32:21.602
THERE'S AN INTERESTING STATISTIC

01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:23.271
PUT OUT -- IT JUST CAME IT JUST

01:32:23.337 --> 01:32:24.739
CAME OUT TWO WEEKS AGO I THINK

01:32:24.805 --> 01:32:27.108
IT'S A FAD STATISTIC A SURVEY OF

01:32:27.174 --> 01:32:28.676
HOW MANY HOUSEHOLDS WOULD HAVE

01:32:28.743 --> 01:32:31.145
DIFFICULTY ABSORBING A SURPRISE

01:32:31.212 --> 01:32:32.446
FOUR HUNDRED DOLLAR COST.

01:32:32.513 --> 01:32:34.148
AND IT'S NOT A SMALL FRACTION OF

01:32:34.215 --> 01:32:36.017
THE POPULATION ON THE EXACT

01:32:36.083 --> 01:32:37.518
NUMBERS ESCAPING ME RIGHT NOW

01:32:37.585 --> 01:32:38.853
BUT I THINK IT WAS ABOUT A THIRD

01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:40.054
OF HOUSEHOLDS WOULD HAVE

01:32:40.121 --> 01:32:41.956
DIFFICULTY -- COVERING A

01:32:42.023 --> 01:32:44.625
SURPRISE FOUR HUNDRED DOLLAR

01:32:44.692 --> 01:32:45.493
COST.

01:32:45.559 --> 01:32:46.661
THE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IT

01:32:46.727 --> 01:32:48.529
APPLIES TO A HOUSEHOLD MAKING

01:32:48.596 --> 01:32:49.797
ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A

01:32:49.864 --> 01:32:52.633
YEAR SO IT'S GRADUATED ACROSS SO

01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:54.802
IF YOU SPEND MORE -- INCOME THEN

01:32:54.869 --> 01:32:56.771
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE HIGHER COSTS

01:32:56.837 --> 01:32:58.039
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS OF THE

01:32:58.105 --> 01:33:01.108
RICHEST HOUSEHOLDS MAY HAVE YOUR

01:33:01.175 --> 01:33:01.742
FIFTEEN HUNDRED TO TWO THOUSAND

01:33:01.809 --> 01:33:04.145
DOLLARS -- IN THESE EXTRA HIDDEN

01:33:04.211 --> 01:33:05.913
TAXES THAT THEY'LL BE PAYING THE

01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:07.315
REASON WHY WE SAY IT'S

01:33:07.381 --> 01:33:09.483
REGRESSIVE NONE THE LESS IT

01:33:09.550 --> 01:33:11.519
FALLS MORE HEAVILY ON LOWER

01:33:11.585 --> 01:33:12.920
INCOME HOUSEHOLDS NONETHELESS.

01:33:12.987 --> 01:33:14.922
IS BECAUSE AS A FRACTION OF

01:33:14.989 --> 01:33:17.792
INCOME THESE HOUSEHOLDS SPEND

01:33:17.858 --> 01:33:19.894
MORE SO THEY SPEND MORE ON

01:33:19.961 --> 01:33:21.729
CONSUMPTION THEY HAVE LESS TO

01:33:21.796 --> 01:33:23.097
PUT AWAY IN SAVINGS.

01:33:23.164 --> 01:33:24.432
AND BECAUSE OF THAT JUST LIKE

01:33:24.498 --> 01:33:27.468
ANY SALES TAX IT'S REGRESSIVE.

01:33:27.535 --> 01:33:29.003
SO THAT'S WHY IT FALLS MORE

01:33:29.070 --> 01:33:33.174
HEAVILY ON PEOPLE THAT HAVE TO

01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:33.808
SPEND A HIGHER FRACTION OF THEIR

01:33:33.874 --> 01:33:36.243
INCOME.

01:33:36.310 --> 01:33:36.911
ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS COLLEAGUES

01:33:36.978 --> 01:33:37.878
MISTER SHOP I COULD FOLLOW UP ON

01:33:37.945 --> 01:33:39.814
THAT POINT A FIVE HUNDRED

01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:42.216
DOLLARS -- PER HOUSEHOLD.

01:33:42.283 --> 01:33:44.185
CONSUMER I PRESUME MOST OF THE

01:33:44.251 --> 01:33:45.987
ITEMS BEING CONSIDER OUR

01:33:46.053 --> 01:33:48.823
CONSISTED OF A CONSUMER ITEMS --

01:33:48.889 --> 01:33:50.224
INSTEAD OF LET'S SAY ELECTRONIC

01:33:50.291 --> 01:33:51.926
PARTS OR OTHERWISE WILL IS THAT

01:33:51.993 --> 01:33:52.827
NOT CORREC.

01:33:52.893 --> 01:33:55.596
SUE -- ACTUALLY THESE ARE BASED

01:33:55.663 --> 01:33:57.365
ON STUDY SO. TO THE BOTTOM THE

01:33:57.431 --> 01:33:59.800
BOTTOM -- OF THE RANGE THAT I

01:33:59.867 --> 01:34:01.602
GAVE YOU THREE HUNDRED EIGHT

01:34:01.669 --> 01:34:02.203
HUNDRED THAT'S JUST A SIMPLE

01:34:02.269 --> 01:34:03.804
OKAY OUR GOODS FROM CHINA ARE

01:34:03.871 --> 01:34:05.506
ABOUT 2% OF CONSUMPTION AND

01:34:05.573 --> 01:34:07.241
INCREASE THE COST OF THOSE BY

01:34:07.308 --> 01:34:09.076
25% AND YOU END UP WITH THREE

01:34:09.143 --> 01:34:10.111
HUNDRED DOLLARS RIGHT SO THAT'S

01:34:10.177 --> 01:34:11.012
REALLY BACK OF THE ENVELOPE IF

01:34:11.078 --> 01:34:11.345
YOU.

01:34:11.412 --> 01:34:13.114
ONLY LOOK STRICTLY AT FINAL

01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:14.248
GOODS.

01:34:14.315 --> 01:34:16.417
THESE OTHER STUDIES -- THE MORE

01:34:16.484 --> 01:34:17.885
IN DEPTH ONES NOT BACK OF THE

01:34:17.952 --> 01:34:20.321
ENVELOPE HAVE ACTUALLY TRACED

01:34:20.388 --> 01:34:22.590
ALSO THE TAXES ON IMPORTED

01:34:22.656 --> 01:34:24.959
IMPORTS FROM CHINA SO FACTORS

01:34:25.026 --> 01:34:26.260
THAT FIRMS IN THE U. S. USING

01:34:26.327 --> 01:34:28.195
PRODUCTION OF FINAL GOODS THAT

01:34:28.262 --> 01:34:29.463
EVENTUALLY ARE PURCHASED BY U.

01:34:29.530 --> 01:34:30.631
S. CONSUMERS.

01:34:30.698 --> 01:34:32.333
AND THEN WHEN YOU DO THAT YOU

01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:33.734
SEE THAT ACTUALLY THE COSTS OF

01:34:33.801 --> 01:34:35.436
TERROR OF SIR ARE PROBABLY QUITE

01:34:35.503 --> 01:34:37.505
A BIT HIGHER THAN THREE HUNDRED

01:34:37.571 --> 01:34:42.176
DOLLARS -- FOR THE AVERAGE

01:34:42.243 --> 01:34:44.812
HOUSEHOLD.

01:34:44.879 --> 01:34:45.746
ALRIGHT SO WITHOUT ANY FURTHER

01:34:45.813 --> 01:34:46.380
QUESTIONS I WANT TO SAY THANK

01:34:46.447 --> 01:34:47.048
YOU TO BOTH OF YOU FOR PROVIDING

01:34:47.114 --> 01:34:47.581
SOME INSIGHT ON HOW THESE

01:34:47.648 --> 01:34:49.583
TERRACE FOR AFFECTING CALIFORNIA

01:34:49.650 --> 01:34:52.153
ECONOMICALLY.

01:34:52.219 --> 01:34:53.621
RIGHT NEXT I WOULD LIKE TO

ACTUALLY GREW.

01:37:57.204 --> 01:37:57.771
AS SHIPPERS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO

01:37:57.838 --> 01:37:59.506

IMPOSITION OF TARIFFS.

01:38:02.610 --> 01:38:04.178
THIS IS NOT A TREND THAT IS LONG

TERM AND SHORT TERM IN NATURE

01:38:05.946 --> 01:38:06.981
AND IT'S NOT THIS IS A NOBLE

01:38:07.047 --> 01:38:08.215
TYPE OF GROWTH THE VIEW THAT WE

01:38:08.282 --> 01:38:09.416
ACTUALLY WELCOME.

01:38:09.483 --> 01:38:10.651
WHERE HOUSING CENTERS ARE

01:38:10.718 --> 01:38:12.086
STARTING TO TO FILL TO THE MAX

01:38:12.152 --> 01:38:13.420
AND WE'VE HEARD THAT THERE'S

01:38:13.487 --> 01:38:15.956
LESS THAN A 1% -- VACANCY RATES

01:38:16.023 --> 01:38:16.857
IN MANY OF THE WAREHOUSING

CENTERS AND THE ST PETER AREA.

01:38:19.593 --> 01:38:21.161
IN SOME CASES -- THE SURGEON

01:38:21.228 --> 01:38:22.529
IMPORT TRADE IS ALSO BECAUSE

01:38:22.596 --> 01:38:24.765
CONGESTION AT PORT FACILITIES

01:38:24.832 --> 01:38:26.300
AMONG THE SUPPLY CHAIN.

01:38:26.367 --> 01:38:27.768
AND ITS RIPPLE THROUGH AND HAD

01:38:27.835 --> 01:38:29.536
IMPACTS WORSHIPPERS AND GROWERS

01:38:29.603 --> 01:38:31.238
ARE NOT ABLE TO GET THEIR GOODS

01:38:31.305 --> 01:38:33.140
TO OR FROM THE PORTS IN TIME.

01:38:33.207 --> 01:38:34.508
ON THE OUTBOUND SIDE -- WE'VE

01:38:34.575 --> 01:38:36.210
SEEN EXPORT TOTALS CONTINUE TO

01:38:36.277 --> 01:38:38.145
SUFFER DUE TO THE COUNTERVAILING

01:38:38.212 --> 01:38:39.947
DUTIES IN THE TERRACE --

01:38:44.084 --> 01:38:45.419
IN OUR TOTALS THAT WE'VE SENT TO

01:38:45.486 --> 01:38:47.354
CHINA A GROWTH AN EMPTY BOXES

01:38:47.421 --> 01:38:51.425
WHICH WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN A

01:38:51.492 --> 01:38:52.026
SPIKE IS NOT A WAY TO HELP OUR

01:38:52.092 --> 01:38:52.293
ECONOMY.

01:38:52.359 --> 01:38:52.893
YOU'LL HEAR FROM THE PARTNERS

ARE SUPPLY CHAIN ABOUT SPECIFIC

01:38:54.194 --> 01:38:54.728
IMPACTS OF THE SECTORS BUT THE

01:38:54.795 --> 01:38:56.263
NEGATIVE LONG TERM IMPACTS THESE

01:38:56.330 --> 01:38:57.231
TERRACE ON AG PRODUCTS

HEARD FROM FROM OUR FIND --

01:39:03.704 --> 01:39:05.606
ECONOMIST SPOKE EARLIER TO THE

STEPPING IN TO PROVIDE THESE

01:39:08.142 --> 01:39:09.643
GOODS TO CHINA INSTEAD OF OUR

01:39:09.710 --> 01:39:11.645
GROWERS IN OUR MANUFACTURES --

01:39:11.712 --> 01:39:12.880
MEANS THAT WE'RE LOSING OUT ON

01:39:12.946 --> 01:39:14.615
IN A LONG TERM ACCESS TO THE

01:39:19.553 --> 01:39:20.020
SO THE LONG TERM POTENTIAL

01:39:20.087 --> 01:39:20.621
REDUCTION TRADE VOLUME HAS A

01:39:20.688 --> 01:39:22.156
CORRESPONDING A DIRECT IMPACT ON

HAPPENING HERE IN THE STATE.

01:39:36.503 --> 01:39:37.504
AND SO WHILE THE STATE MAY NOT

01:39:37.571 --> 01:39:40.441
BE ABLE TO DIRECTLY AND DO THESE

IMPORTANTLY TO PROTECT OUR

PERTAIN TO OUR RETAIL INDUSTRY.

01:41:30.050 --> 01:41:30.851
FIRST OF ALL LET'S REMEMBER

01:41:30.918 --> 01:41:33.086
TARIFFS OR TAXES RIGHT THEY'RE

01:41:33.153 --> 01:41:34.521

BUSINESSES WORKERS AND

01:41:35.923 --> 01:41:36.723
COMMUNITIES.

01:41:36.790 --> 01:41:38.625
TODAY CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS HAVE

01:41:38.692 --> 01:41:40.427
PAID THREE POINT SIX BILLION

01:41:40.494 --> 01:41:42.896

THIRTY NINE MILLION IN MARCH

01:41:45.866 --> 01:41:46.767

01:41:46.834 --> 01:41:47.968
SINCE THE TRADE WORDS BEGAN%

01:41:48.035 --> 01:41:50.037
CALIFORNIA EXPORTS FACED ONE

01:41:50.103 --> 01:41:52.139

INCLUDING A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY

01:41:56.610 --> 01:41:58.245
MILLION IN JANUARY.

01:41:58.312 --> 01:41:59.880
THESE TERRACE MAKE CALIFORNIA

01:41:59.947 --> 01:42:01.548
LESS COMPETITIVE.

01:42:01.615 --> 01:42:02.583
ABOUT SOME LARGE RETAIL BRANDS

01:42:02.649 --> 01:42:03.684
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ABSORB

01:42:03.750 --> 01:42:07.688
INCREASED COST AND NOT PASS THEM

01:42:07.754 --> 01:42:08.288
ON TO CONSUMERS.

01:42:08.355 --> 01:42:09.389
THAT IS NOT THE CASE WITH THIS

01:42:09.456 --> 01:42:10.924
ROUND OF TERROR OF NEGOTIATIONS

01:42:10.991 --> 01:42:12.493
WELL WE AGREE WITH THE NEED TO

01:42:12.559 --> 01:42:14.027
ADDRESS LONG STANDING ISSUES

01:42:14.094 --> 01:42:15.362
WITH CHINA'S UNFAIR TRADE

01:42:15.429 --> 01:42:16.463
PRACTICES.

01:42:16.530 --> 01:42:17.397
AND WANT TO SEE A MEANINGFUL

01:42:17.464 --> 01:42:18.599
TRADE DEAL THAT LEVELS THE

01:42:18.665 --> 01:42:20.167

01:42:20.234 --> 01:42:21.802
BUSINESSES AND WORKERS.

01:42:21.869 --> 01:42:23.303
DOUBLING DOWN ON A STRATEGY

01:42:23.370 --> 01:42:24.938
BASED SOLELY ON TERRACE IS TOO

01:42:25.005 --> 01:42:26.106
GREAT A GAMBLE FOR THE US

01:42:26.173 --> 01:42:29.843
ECONOMY CALIFORNIA.

01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:31.245
AND CONSUMERS ACROSS THE STATE.

01:42:31.311 --> 01:42:32.713

STAKE WHEN TERRACE ARE PUT INTO

01:42:34.648 --> 01:42:35.349

ALREADY HURTING FROM THIS TRADE

01:42:46.059 --> 01:42:47.761
WAR AND CAN AFFORD MORE

01:42:47.828 --> 01:42:48.829
TERRORISTS.

01:42:48.896 --> 01:42:50.030
IN THESE SMALL BIZ THESE SMALL

01:42:50.097 --> 01:42:51.598
BUSINESS OWNERS CAN NO LONGER BE

01:42:51.665 --> 01:42:52.900
COMPETITIVE IN CALIFORNIA'S

01:42:52.966 --> 01:42:54.635
ECONOMY WE COULD SEE THEM

01:42:54.701 --> 01:42:56.003
SHUTTING THEIR DOORS AND LAYING

01:42:56.069 --> 01:42:57.371
OFF EMPLOYEES.

01:42:57.437 --> 01:42:59.306
THIS COULD NEVER NEGATIVELY

01:42:59.373 --> 01:43:00.107
IMPACT THE COMMUNITIES THEY

01:43:00.173 --> 01:43:01.875
SERVE AND COULD HAVE A MAJOR

01:43:01.942 --> 01:43:03.277
IMPACT IN OUR WORLD AND

01:43:03.343 --> 01:43:04.945
UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES.

01:43:05.012 --> 01:43:08.115
AND HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON

01:43:08.181 --> 01:43:09.082
CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY.

01:43:09.149 --> 01:43:10.417
WHEN THE TERRACE WHERE THE 10%

STRATEGIES TO LESSEN THE BURDEN

01:43:13.954 --> 01:43:15.589
ON CONSUMERS WHILE HOPING THE

01:43:15.656 --> 01:43:17.124
INCREASED COSTS WOULD ONLY BE

SHORT TERM SHORT SHORT TERM?

01:43:19.159 --> 01:43:21.461
HOWEVER MANY SMALL RETAILERS

01:43:21.528 --> 01:43:23.130
WITH LIMITED RESOURCES COULD NOT

01:43:23.196 --> 01:43:25.365
ABSORB THOSE TERRORISTS CAM ARE

01:43:25.432 --> 01:43:27.067
FORCED TO INCREASE THE COST.

01:43:27.134 --> 01:43:30.938
THOSE COSTS ARE NOW PAID BY THE

01:43:31.004 --> 01:43:32.306

01:43:35.142 --> 01:43:36.543
MITIGATING THE IMPACT AND

01:43:36.610 --> 01:43:38.512
CONSUMERS WILL START TO SEE MORE

01:43:38.579 --> 01:43:40.013
NOTICEABLE PRICE INCREASES.

01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:41.815
ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE

01:43:41.882 --> 01:43:43.083
ADMINISTRATION'S THREAT TO

01:43:43.150 --> 01:43:45.686
TARGET ALL CHINESE IMPORTS.

01:43:45.752 --> 01:43:47.754
IF THOSE THREATS BECOME REALITY

01:43:47.821 --> 01:43:49.423
CONSUMERS WILL SEE PRICES RISE

01:43:49.489 --> 01:43:51.725
FURTHER IN A RANGE OF PRODUCTS

WE TELL OFFER WITH WE OPERATE IN

01:44:00.601 --> 01:44:02.336
A VERY COMPETITIVE MARKET.

01:44:02.402 --> 01:44:03.637
AND SOME COMPANIES MAY DEAL WITH

01:44:03.704 --> 01:44:05.339
THE ADDED COSTS IN OTHER WAYS IN

PRICING. FOR EXAMPLE.

01:44:09.142 --> 01:44:10.510
THE TERRORISTS COULD DISCOURAGE

01:44:10.577 --> 01:44:12.412
CALIFORNIA INVESTMENTS RELATING

OF LOSING RETAIL JOBS.

01:44:32.633 --> 01:44:33.467

SELECT MY LET ME BE CLEAR BY

01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:41.541
MORE THAN DOUBLING THE TERRACE

01:44:41.608 --> 01:44:43.110
THIS WILL DISCOURAGE INVESTMENT

WHAT THEY HAVE IN STOCK NOW.

01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:05.065

SHIFTED TO DOMESTIC SOURCES

01:45:18.045 --> 01:45:19.713
BECAUSE THOSE SOURCES TO NOT

EXIST ON A SCALE THAT THEY NEED.

01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:23.917
EVEN IF THERE IS AN EVENTUAL

AND WILL COST MORE.

01:45:49.443 --> 01:45:50.911
MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WILL

CALIFORNIA FAMILIES RUN FIXED

01:45:59.486 --> 01:46:00.921
INCOMES COULD BE GREATLY

01:46:00.987 --> 01:46:03.290
IMPACTED AS WE SEEK ROB LET

01:46:03.356 --> 01:46:05.325

LAYOFFS TAKE PLACE AND PRICES

01:46:08.228 --> 01:46:11.164
INCREASE FOR NEEDED GOODS ACROSS

01:46:11.231 --> 01:46:12.065
THE STATE.

01:46:12.132 --> 01:46:13.200
AS RETAILERS ARE HIT WITH HIGHER

01:46:13.266 --> 01:46:14.668
TARIFFS THAT THEY CAN NO LONGER

01:46:14.735 --> 01:46:15.535
ABSORB.

01:46:15.602 --> 01:46:16.837
AS THERE IS UNCERTAINTY IN THE

01:46:16.903 --> 01:46:18.405
MARKET PLACE MAKING IT HARDER

01:46:18.472 --> 01:46:20.073
FOR RETAILERS TO MAKE LONG RANGE

01:46:20.140 --> 01:46:21.742
SUPPLY PLANS PRICES WILL

01:46:21.808 --> 01:46:23.510
INCREASE AND THE FINAL PURCHASES

01:46:23.577 --> 01:46:26.179
OF GOODS OR PURCHASE LESS.

01:46:26.246 --> 01:46:27.647
BECAUSE THE GOODS COST MORE.

01:46:27.714 --> 01:46:29.783
SALES DECLINES EVENTUALLY LEAD

01:46:29.850 --> 01:46:31.351
TO UNEMPLOYMENT CUTS AND

01:46:31.418 --> 01:46:33.120
EMPLOYMENT CUTS RESULT IN LOWER

ON A RANGE OF GOODS AND SERVICES.

01:46:37.657 --> 01:46:38.592
SO CONSUMERS INSTEAD OF BUYING

01:46:38.658 --> 01:46:41.294
THAT NEW CAR THE FAMILY'S GOING

01:46:41.361 --> 01:46:42.362
TO BUY A USED CAR.

01:46:42.429 --> 01:46:43.630
FAMILIES WILL GO OUT TO DINNER

01:46:43.697 --> 01:46:46.066
LESS UNEMPLOYED WORKERS WILL CUT

01:46:46.133 --> 01:46:47.234
EVEN MORE DISCRETIONARY

01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:48.535

POSTPONED.

01:46:51.505 --> 01:46:53.073
EACH OF THESE DECISIONS WILL

01:46:53.140 --> 01:46:54.908
HAVE EMPLOYMENT IMPACTS ON THE

BOTH SIDES HAVE MADE IMPORTANT

01:47:14.795 --> 01:47:15.862
THAT **** FOR TAT TERRACE WILL

TO A PROLONGED TRADE WAR THAT

01:47:19.299 --> 01:47:21.635
WILL DAMAGE CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY.

01:47:21.701 --> 01:47:23.136

01:47:26.173 --> 01:47:26.873
USUALLY COME OFF.

01:47:26.940 --> 01:47:28.108
AMERICAN CONSUMERS ARE STILL

01:47:28.175 --> 01:47:30.010
PAYING TERRACE THAT WERE PUT IN

01:47:30.076 --> 01:47:30.477
PLACE DURING THE GREAT

01:47:30.544 --> 01:47:32.279
DEPRESSION.

01:47:32.345 --> 01:47:33.213
THE THREAT OF TERROR OF SOME

01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:35.282
CHINESE IMPORTS IS TOO GREAT A

01:47:35.348 --> 01:47:36.750
GAMBLE FOR ABOUT THE US ECONOMY

01:47:36.817 --> 01:47:38.451
AND FOR CALIFORNIA.

01:47:38.518 --> 01:47:40.020
THIS LEVEL OF ESCALATION WILL

01:47:40.086 --> 01:47:41.621
WHILE OUR FINANCIAL MARKETS

01:47:41.688 --> 01:47:43.757
DESTROY JOBS RAISE PRICES FOR

01:47:43.824 --> 01:47:45.325
CALIFORNIA FAMILIES AND

01:47:45.392 --> 01:47:46.426
ULTIMATELY UNDERMINE THE

01:47:46.493 --> 01:47:48.662

01:47:48.728 --> 01:47:50.297
RECENT YEARS.

01:47:50.363 --> 01:47:51.932
SO WHAT DO RETAILERS WANT TO SEE.

01:47:51.998 --> 01:47:53.700
WE WOULD LIKE THE FULL IMMEDIATE

01:47:53.767 --> 01:47:55.969
REMOVAL OF TERRORISTS ANY DEAL

01:47:56.036 --> 01:47:58.205
MUST RESULT IN A COMPLETE WILL

01:47:58.271 --> 01:47:59.573
BACK OF IS IT A BIT SIXTEEN AND

01:47:59.639 --> 01:48:01.341
RETALIATORY TARIFFS WE WENT

01:48:01.408 --> 01:48:02.976
MEANING FOR FORMS TO LEVEL THE

01:48:08.682 --> 01:48:09.916
INNOVATION AT RISK.

01:48:09.983 --> 01:48:11.952
WE WANT TO AVOID ANY ENFORCEMENT

01:48:12.018 --> 01:48:13.453
MECHANISM THAT WOULD TRIGGER

01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:16.823
MORE TERRACE AND RESULT IN LONG

01:48:16.890 --> 01:48:18.124

01:48:18.191 --> 01:48:19.159
WELL WHAT CAN YEARS CALIFORNIA

01:48:19.226 --> 01:48:19.926
LAWMAKERS DO.

01:48:19.993 --> 01:48:21.628
CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY COULD SEE

01:48:21.695 --> 01:48:23.964
VERY NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF THE

01:48:24.030 --> 01:48:26.266
TERROR OF WORK CONTINUES.

01:48:26.333 --> 01:48:27.901
WE ASK STATE LAWMAKERS. TO LOOK

01:48:27.968 --> 01:48:29.236

RETAILERS AND UNDERSTAND THAT

01:48:31.872 --> 01:48:33.607
WHILE SOME REGULATION BY WELL

01:48:34.641 --> 01:48:36.076
BURDENS RETAILERS WITH MORE

01:48:36.142 --> 01:48:37.978
COSTS THAT ARE COMPOUNDED BY THE

01:48:38.044 --> 01:48:40.280
PROPOSED TARIFFS BY LOOKING FOR

01:48:40.347 --> 01:48:41.815
WAYS TO LASSEN REGULATION ON

01:48:41.882 --> 01:48:43.884

01:48:43.950 --> 01:48:45.652
RETAILERS CAN LOOK AT WAYS TO

NOT PASS ADDITIONAL COSTS ON TO

01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:49.589
CONSUMERS DUE TO THESE TERRACE.

01:48:49.656 --> 01:48:50.590

PAST YEAR THE US AND CHINA HAVE

01:49:43.109 --> 01:49:44.844
BEEN ENGAGED IN A COSTLY TRADE

WAR FROM THE BEGINNING TECH NET

01:49:46.980 --> 01:49:48.415

01:49:48.481 --> 01:49:50.183
ADMINISTRATION'S POLICY OF

SWEEPING TERRACE TO ACHIEVE ITS

01:49:51.885 --> 01:49:53.353
GOAL OF COMPELLING CHINA TO

CHANGE ITS UNFAIR TRADE

01:49:55.889 --> 01:49:56.122

01:49:56.189 --> 01:49:57.457
CALIFORNIA IS THE WORLD'S FIFTH

01:49:57.524 --> 01:49:59.893
LARGEST ECONOMY A MAJOR REASON

01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:01.328
FOR THAT SUCCESS IS THAT WE ARE

01:50:01.394 --> 01:50:03.029

ECONOMIC GROWTH AND JOB CREATION

01:50:15.809 --> 01:50:17.444
IN THE U. S. TECH SECTOR IN FACT

01:50:17.510 --> 01:50:19.879

CHINA WAS THIRD.

01:50:38.932 --> 01:50:40.867
HOWEVER THE TERRACE INCREASE THE

01:50:40.934 --> 01:50:42.769
COST OF MAKING OUR PRODUCTS OFF

01:50:42.836 --> 01:50:44.571
INCREASING THE PRICE TAG HIGHER

01:50:44.637 --> 01:50:47.140
PRICES MAKE THEM MORE EXPENSIVE

01:50:47.207 --> 01:50:48.575
AND HARDER TO SELL ABROAD.

01:50:48.641 --> 01:50:50.777
COMPETITION ABROAD IS FIERCE BUT

01:50:50.844 --> 01:50:52.379
WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT THE US

HOWEVER FAIR AND LEVEL IS NOT

01:51:01.588 --> 01:51:02.655
WHAT WE HAVE WHEN OUR FOREIGN

01:51:02.722 --> 01:51:04.224

01:51:04.290 --> 01:51:06.292
WITH THESE TARIFFS AND CAN OFFER

01:51:06.359 --> 01:51:07.927

01:51:24.544 --> 01:51:25.078
IN FACT ONE STUDY SHOWS THAT

EXIST.

01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:08.788
IN ESSENCE THESE TERRORISTS NOT

01:57:08.855 --> 01:57:10.289
ONLY HURT THE AMERICAN TAX

01:57:10.356 --> 01:57:11.657
SECTOR THE ADMINISTRATION IS

01:57:11.724 --> 01:57:13.126
WORKING TO PROTECT.

01:57:13.192 --> 01:57:14.761
BUT THEY ALSO HEARD MANY MORE

01:57:14.827 --> 01:57:16.896
WORKERS AT CROSS VARIOUS SECTORS

01:57:50.163 --> 01:57:51.864
OPERATING COSTS GO UP AND TOUGH

01:57:51.931 --> 01:57:53.699
DECISIONS HAVE TO BE MADE ABOUT

TERRACE POLICIES IN CHINA WE

01:58:23.896 --> 01:58:25.198
WOULD BE REMISS IF WE DID NOT

01:58:25.264 --> 01:58:27.200
ALSO HIGHLIGHT THE DEEP CONCERNS

01:58:27.266 --> 01:58:29.268
AND STRONG OPPOSITION WE HAVE TO

01:58:29.335 --> 01:58:30.803
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S NEWLY

01:58:30.870 --> 01:58:33.206
PROPOSED TARIFFS ON MEXICO WHICH

CALIFORNIA MEXICAN ECONOMIES

01:58:40.780 --> 01:58:42.381
HAVE BEEN LINKED FOR CENTURIES

01:58:42.448 --> 01:58:44.183
AND GENERATED ENORMOUS ECONOMIC

01:58:47.019 --> 01:58:48.421
POPULATIONS.

01:58:48.488 --> 01:58:50.122
IN FACT MEXICO'S CALIFORNIA'S

01:58:50.189 --> 01:58:52.425
NUMBER ONE TRADING PARTNER THE

01:58:52.492 --> 01:58:54.126
VALUE OF CALIFORNIA'S EXPORTS TO

01:58:54.193 --> 01:58:56.496
MEXICO HAS RISEN MORE THAN 20%

01:58:56.562 --> 01:58:58.698

ABANDON THIS PLAN.

01:59:07.406 --> 01:59:09.675
IN CONCLUSION THIS PROLONG TRADE

01:59:09.742 --> 01:59:10.810
WAR IS HURTING AMERICAN

CREATORS ACROSS ALL SECTORS

01:59:15.081 --> 01:59:16.716
CHINA MUST BE CONFRONTED ABOUT

01:59:16.782 --> 01:59:19.118
IT'S UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES BUT

01:59:19.185 --> 01:59:21.854
HI TERRACE ON A 100% OF CHINESE

01:59:21.921 --> 01:59:23.556
EXPORS IMPORTS WILL HAVE A

01:59:23.623 --> 01:59:25.291
DEVASTATING IMPACT ON THE LONG

GOVERNMENT'S TO WORK STRENUOUSLY

01:59:51.384 --> 01:59:54.687
TO RESOLVE THE SITUATION AND AND

01:59:54.754 --> 01:59:56.188
THE TERRORISTS THANK YOU.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- THERE'S A

01:59:57.957 --> 02:00:02.194
LOT TO DIVE INTO WITH A WITH.

02:00:02.261 --> 02:00:04.163
THE FIRST THREE MEMBERS OF OF

02:00:04.230 --> 02:00:06.532
THE PANEL AND AND SO I WANT TO

02:00:06.599 --> 02:00:08.701
JUST JUMP RIGHT IN PARTICULARLY

02:00:08.768 --> 02:00:10.836
WITH THE IMPACT ON RETAILERS --

02:00:10.903 --> 02:00:12.471
WHICH EVERYONE SEES THOSE

02:00:12.538 --> 02:00:15.174
IMPACTS EVERYONE UP HERE -- BUT

02:00:15.241 --> 02:00:16.943
WE'VE SEEN JUST BE INCREDIBLE

02:00:17.009 --> 02:00:18.678
SHRINKING BRICK AND MORTAR

02:00:18.744 --> 02:00:20.513
RETAILER -- WHETHER IT'S

02:00:20.580 --> 02:00:22.848
STRICTLY APPAREL OR EVEN A

02:00:22.915 --> 02:00:23.849
DEPARTMENT STORES THAT CARRY

02:00:23.916 --> 02:00:26.319
MUCH MORE LIKE SEARS AND

02:00:26.385 --> 02:00:27.553
PARTICULARLY IN DIFFERENT

02:00:27.620 --> 02:00:29.188
QUALITY SEGMENTS.

02:00:29.255 --> 02:00:34.360
AND AND SO WITH CHINA -- AND AND

02:00:34.427 --> 02:00:36.162
IT'S IT'S ONE HAS A GROWING

02:00:36.228 --> 02:00:37.296
MIDDLE CLASS.

02:00:37.363 --> 02:00:39.899
COSTS OF PRODUCING IN CHINA HAVE

02:00:39.966 --> 02:00:41.434
GONE UP BUT AT THE SAME TIME

02:00:41.500 --> 02:00:43.502
QUALITY HAS GONE UP WITH

02:00:43.569 --> 02:00:45.571
PRODUCTS FROM CHINA AS WELL.

02:00:45.638 --> 02:00:48.474
WILL WE SEE A THOSE RETAILERS

02:00:48.541 --> 02:00:51.177
THAT BY LESSER QUALITY LOWER

02:00:51.243 --> 02:00:53.212
COST GOODS FROM REGIONS THE

02:00:53.279 --> 02:00:55.481
WORLD THAT PAY LESS -- WE SEE

02:00:55.548 --> 02:00:56.916
MORE OF THOSE PRODUCTS IN THE

02:00:56.983 --> 02:00:58.451
UNITED STATES.

02:00:58.517 --> 02:01:01.754
OR WILL OR OR WILL WE JUST SEE A

02:01:01.821 --> 02:01:03.322
LOT OF THESE COMPANIES YOU KNOW

02:01:03.389 --> 02:01:04.590
CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE ALONG

02:01:04.657 --> 02:01:06.859
WITHOUT SHIFTING WHERE

02:01:06.926 --> 02:01:09.061
MANUFACTURING TAKES PLACE.

02:01:09.128 --> 02:01:10.096
I THINK IT DEPENDS ON THE ON WHO

02:01:10.162 --> 02:01:12.131
THE RETAILER IS I THINK SOME OF

02:01:12.198 --> 02:01:13.766
THAT MAY BE THE LARGER NATIONAL

02:01:13.833 --> 02:01:15.067
BRANDS WILL BE ABLE TO GO A

02:01:15.134 --> 02:01:16.435
LITTLE BIT LONGER AND ABSORB

02:01:16.502 --> 02:01:19.138
SOME OF THAT THE INCREASED COSTS.

02:01:19.205 --> 02:01:20.740
ARE CONCERNED -- PARTICULARLY

02:01:20.806 --> 02:01:22.875
SMALLER RETAILERS I MEAN THERE'S

02:01:22.942 --> 02:01:24.610
A LOT OF THEM IN CALIFORNIA I

02:01:24.677 --> 02:01:25.478
MEAN THERE'S A LET ME GO DOWN

02:01:25.544 --> 02:01:27.346
THE OLD SAT THOSE ARE ALL SMALL

02:01:27.413 --> 02:01:29.382
RETAILERS THAT ARE GONNA BE

02:01:29.448 --> 02:01:31.751
NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THIS.

02:01:31.817 --> 02:01:32.652
AND THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO MAKE A

02:01:32.718 --> 02:01:34.620
CHOICE EITHER THEY CAN STAY IN

02:01:34.687 --> 02:01:36.789
BUSINESS BY MAYBE HAVING TO FIND

02:01:36.856 --> 02:01:38.491
OTHER SOURCES THEY'RE CHEAPER

02:01:38.557 --> 02:01:39.725
MAYBE NOT THE SAME QUALITY THAT

02:01:39.792 --> 02:01:41.293
THEY WERE GETTING BEFORE OR

02:01:41.360 --> 02:01:42.094
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CLOSE

02:01:42.161 --> 02:01:44.063
DOWN AND NOT BE ABLE TO TO HAVE

02:01:44.130 --> 02:01:45.264
THE BUSINESS ANYMORE.

02:01:45.331 --> 02:01:46.599
SO I THINK AND IT DEPENDING ON

02:01:46.666 --> 02:01:48.200
HOW LONG THESE TERRORISTS

02:01:48.267 --> 02:01:49.635
CONTINUE.

02:01:49.702 --> 02:01:51.137
YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO

02:01:51.203 --> 02:01:52.271
TO SOME OF THE LARGER AND LARGER

02:01:52.338 --> 02:01:53.839
RETAILER CHAINS AS WELL I MEAN

02:01:53.906 --> 02:01:55.708
THEY THEY RUN ON A VERY SMALL

02:01:55.775 --> 02:01:56.742
PROFIT MARGIN.

02:01:56.809 --> 02:01:58.010
THEY'RE VERY COMPETITIVE THEIR

02:01:58.077 --> 02:02:00.179
COMPETITIVE AGAINST EACH OTHER

02:02:00.246 --> 02:02:01.781
SO THEY'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR

02:02:01.847 --> 02:02:03.349
WAYS TO BE COMPETITIVE WHEN IT

02:02:03.416 --> 02:02:04.450
COMES TO PRICING.

02:02:04.517 --> 02:02:05.184
AND THOSE ARE SOME OF THE

02:02:05.251 --> 02:02:06.352
DECISIONS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO

02:02:06.419 --> 02:02:08.287
BE FORCED TO MAKE.

02:02:08.354 --> 02:02:09.755
THANK YOU SON RACHMAN.

02:02:09.822 --> 02:02:11.057
YEAH GONNA ALONG THAT SEAM LINES

02:02:11.123 --> 02:02:12.358
I CAN SEE A SCENARIO WHERE

02:02:12.425 --> 02:02:14.026
LARGER RETAILERS MIGHT HAVE

02:02:14.093 --> 02:02:15.094
THINGS OFF IN A WAREHOUSE

02:02:15.161 --> 02:02:17.063
SOMEWHERE AND CAN WORK ON THEIR

02:02:17.129 --> 02:02:18.064
SUPPLIERS A SMALLER.

02:02:18.130 --> 02:02:20.433
RETAILER DOESN'T HAVE THAT THAT

02:02:20.499 --> 02:02:22.001
FLEXIBILITY RIGHT SO THEY'RE BY

02:02:22.068 --> 02:02:23.636
MORE -- AND SO AS WE'VE SEEN IN

02:02:23.703 --> 02:02:25.538
THE AGRICULTURE COMMUNITY AS

02:02:25.604 --> 02:02:27.773
SMALLER FARMS HAVE GONE AWAY AND

02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:29.108
LARGE CORPORATE FARMS ABOUT THEM

02:02:29.175 --> 02:02:31.277
UP WE CONTINUE TO SEE I THINK

02:02:31.343 --> 02:02:33.312
THE THE LOSS OF THE SMALL AND

02:02:33.379 --> 02:02:36.082
MID LEVEL FARMS -- UP RETAILERS

02:02:36.148 --> 02:02:38.184
GOING MORE TOWARDS LARGE ONES OR

02:02:38.250 --> 02:02:40.419
EVEN IN TWO TO ONLINE SHOPPING.

02:02:40.486 --> 02:02:41.754
I THINK THAT'S THAT COULD

02:02:41.821 --> 02:02:42.888
ABSOLUTELY HAPPEN AND THAT'S

02:02:42.955 --> 02:02:43.989
THAT'S WHAT'S CONCERNING BECAUSE

02:02:44.056 --> 02:02:45.424
WHEN YOU GO INTO THE SMALL TOWNS

02:02:45.491 --> 02:02:47.626
IN CALIFORNIA HERE YOU GO DOWN

02:02:47.693 --> 02:02:49.028
THE MAIN STREETS AND ON SOME OF

02:02:49.095 --> 02:02:49.595
THESE OLD TOWNS IT'S THOSE

02:02:49.662 --> 02:02:51.997
RETAILERS THAT ARE KIND OF WHERE

02:02:52.064 --> 02:02:53.499
PEOPLE GO THEY GET THEIR GOSSIP

02:02:53.566 --> 02:02:54.233
AND THE COMMUNITY.

02:02:54.300 --> 02:02:55.501
THEY THAT THAT CONNECTS THE

02:02:55.568 --> 02:02:57.236
COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND IF THOSE

02:02:57.303 --> 02:02:58.738
RETAILERS CANNOT STAY

02:02:58.804 --> 02:03:00.539
COMPETITIVE THEY'RE GOING TO GO

02:03:00.606 --> 02:03:02.108
OUT OF BUSINESS I THINK YOU'RE

02:03:02.174 --> 02:03:02.908
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IN YOUR

02:03:02.975 --> 02:03:04.376
COMMENTS SOME OF THE LARGER

02:03:04.443 --> 02:03:11.650
RETAILERS DO YOU HAVE.

02:03:11.717 --> 02:03:13.919
THE ABILITY TO HAVE IN TORY THAT

02:03:13.986 --> 02:03:15.187
THEY CAN TAP INTO BUT ONLY FOR

02:03:15.254 --> 02:03:16.889
SO LONG BUT PRETTY SOON EIGHTIES

02:03:16.956 --> 02:03:17.923
COSTUME TO BE CONTINUED ON TO

02:03:17.990 --> 02:03:18.290
THE CONSUMERS.

02:03:18.357 --> 02:03:19.925
AND BE YES WE COULD ABSOLUTELY

02:03:19.992 --> 02:03:20.693
SEE THAT AND I AND I THINK IT

02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:21.627
WILL EVENTUALLY COULD AFFECT THE

02:03:21.694 --> 02:03:22.728
LARGER RETAILERS WHEN YOU SEE

02:03:22.795 --> 02:03:25.331
MORE YOU KNOW ONLINE ECOMMERCE.

02:03:25.397 --> 02:03:27.066
WHICH YEAH WELL THAT'S GREAT

02:03:27.133 --> 02:03:28.400
BENEFITS THEY'RE ALSO THEY'RE

02:03:28.467 --> 02:03:30.369
ALSO THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK

02:03:30.436 --> 02:03:31.737
OUT FOR WITHOUT IS CONCERNED SO

02:03:31.804 --> 02:03:32.705
I THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY

02:03:32.772 --> 02:03:34.340
CORRECT IS THE FAX.

02:03:34.406 --> 02:03:35.541
EACH TYPE OF RETAIL IN A

02:03:35.608 --> 02:03:38.277
DIFFERENT WAY BUT I THINK EVEN

02:03:38.344 --> 02:03:39.245
THOUGH A LOT OF OUR MEMBERS ARE

02:03:39.311 --> 02:03:42.114
SUCH AS THE LARGER BRANDS.

02:03:42.181 --> 02:03:43.149
THEY ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

02:03:43.215 --> 02:03:44.283
THIS PARTICULAR THE SMALL

02:03:44.350 --> 02:03:46.218
BUSINESSES IN THE SMALL BUSINESS

02:03:46.285 --> 02:03:47.653
OWNERS THAT MAYBE OF HOW THIS

02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:51.123
RETAIL ESTABLISHMENT FOR YEARS

02:03:51.190 --> 02:03:52.458
THAT WON'T BE ABLE TO COMPETE

02:03:52.525 --> 02:03:53.859
ANYMORE.

02:03:53.926 --> 02:03:54.860
WE JUST HAD A SMALL LITTLE

02:03:54.927 --> 02:03:55.995
DRUGSTORE IN MY IN MY

02:03:56.061 --> 02:03:56.896
NEIGHBORHOOD WHEN THE LAST OLD

02:03:56.962 --> 02:03:58.297
NEIGHBORHOOD DRUGSTORES HUNDRED

02:03:58.364 --> 02:04:00.266
YEARS IN BUSINESS JUST CLOSE

02:04:00.332 --> 02:04:02.234
THEIR DOORS AND IT'S SAD I MEAN

02:04:02.301 --> 02:04:02.868
IT'S ANY MORE IN THAT LOSS IN

02:04:02.935 --> 02:04:07.706
YOUR COMMUNITY.

02:04:07.773 --> 02:04:08.307
AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:04:08.374 --> 02:04:10.075
DOESN'T HAPPEN.

02:04:10.142 --> 02:04:12.611
FURTHER ON THE RETAIL.

02:04:12.678 --> 02:04:13.279
SEGMENT TONIGHT.

02:04:13.345 --> 02:04:13.946
APPAREL IN PARTICULAR WHICH I'M

02:04:14.013 --> 02:04:15.147
CONCERNED ABOUT BECAUSE THERE

02:04:15.214 --> 02:04:17.483
ARE SEASONAL CHANGES YOU CAN'T

02:04:17.550 --> 02:04:19.051
KEEP THE SAME GOODS.

02:04:19.118 --> 02:04:20.553
AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE GOING TO

02:04:20.619 --> 02:04:21.754
WEAR THE SAME CLOTHES FROM

02:04:21.821 --> 02:04:23.122
SEASON TO SEASON THEY HAVE TO

02:04:23.189 --> 02:04:25.324
CHANGE -- AND OF COURSE STYLES

02:04:25.391 --> 02:04:28.861
TO CHANGE AS WELL SO -- YOU KNOW

02:04:28.928 --> 02:04:30.996
HOW.

02:04:31.063 --> 02:04:32.231
HOW DO YOU THINK YOU FEEL THAT

02:04:32.298 --> 02:04:33.999
THAT'S GOING TO REALLY IMPACT --

02:04:34.066 --> 02:04:36.468
CONSUMER CHOICE -- IN WHAT WHAT

02:04:36.535 --> 02:04:37.536
OPTIONS THAT THEY HAVE AND

02:04:37.603 --> 02:04:38.637
WHETHER OR NOT RETAILERS ARE

02:04:38.704 --> 02:04:39.839
GOING TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH

02:04:39.905 --> 02:04:41.073
THAT TYPE OF CHANGE WHETHER OR

02:04:41.140 --> 02:04:42.541
NOT THEY HAVE GARMENTS THAT CAN

02:04:42.608 --> 02:04:44.176
GO FROM SEASON TO SEASON HAVE

02:04:44.243 --> 02:04:44.844
YOU SEEN ANYONE.

02:04:44.910 --> 02:04:46.645
ANY OF YOUR MEMBERS DEALING WITH

02:04:46.712 --> 02:04:48.013
THAT NOW.

02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:49.715
I'M NOT YET BY YOU KNOW THAT

02:04:49.782 --> 02:04:51.150
GOES TO THE SUPPLY CHAIN THAT

02:04:51.217 --> 02:04:52.484
GOES CAN THEY GET THEIR GOODS

02:04:52.551 --> 02:04:54.687
INTO THE US HOW MUCH IS IT GOING

02:04:54.753 --> 02:04:55.454
TO COST.

02:04:55.521 --> 02:04:57.523
AND THAT ALSO IS GOING TO BE

02:04:57.590 --> 02:04:58.824
IMPACTED BY WHAT CONSUMERS ARE

02:04:58.891 --> 02:04:59.859
GOING TO BUY I MEAN IF THEY'RE

02:04:59.925 --> 02:05:02.461
HAVING TO PAY MORE MONEY.

02:05:02.528 --> 02:05:04.597
FOR THEIR FOOD OR FOR THE

02:05:04.663 --> 02:05:06.465
ESSENTIAL ITEMS THAT THEY NEED

02:05:06.532 --> 02:05:07.600
AND THOSE COSTS HAVE GONE AT

02:05:07.666 --> 02:05:09.168
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE LESS MONEY

02:05:09.235 --> 02:05:10.970
TO SPEND ON SOME OF THOSE TYPES

02:05:11.036 --> 02:05:11.604
OF THINGS THAT YOU'RE TALKING

02:05:11.670 --> 02:05:12.571
ABOUT.

02:05:12.638 --> 02:05:13.939
SO I THINK YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT

02:05:14.006 --> 02:05:16.542
IT FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE AND BUT

02:05:16.609 --> 02:05:18.177
I DO THINK THEY I MEAN RETAILERS

02:05:18.244 --> 02:05:19.578
WILL LOOK AT HOW THEY CAN STAY

02:05:19.645 --> 02:05:21.146
IN BUSINESS HOW CAN THEY WEATHER

02:05:21.213 --> 02:05:22.514
THIS STORM.

02:05:22.581 --> 02:05:23.916
AND PART OF IT MAY BE A REDUCED

02:05:23.983 --> 02:05:26.151
INVENTORY BUT THEY WILL WANT TO

02:05:26.218 --> 02:05:27.686
DO WHATEVER THEY CAN IN ORDER TO

02:05:27.753 --> 02:05:28.654
STAY COMPETITIVE.

02:05:28.721 --> 02:05:30.389
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT I MEAN IN PARTS

02:05:30.456 --> 02:05:31.657
OF THE COUNTRY I MEAN WELL EVEN

02:05:31.724 --> 02:05:33.592
HERE IN IN SACRAMENTO WE HAD IT

02:05:33.659 --> 02:05:37.897
SEEMED LIKE A LONG WINTER AND

02:05:37.963 --> 02:05:41.800
NOW WE'RE BACK.

02:05:41.867 --> 02:05:42.434
TWO HUNDRED INCREASING COSTS ON

02:05:42.501 --> 02:05:48.240
DEODORANT AND YOU KNOW I MEAN AN

02:05:48.307 --> 02:05:49.008
EXIT MY HUSBAND AND I WERE

02:05:49.074 --> 02:05:49.975
LOOKING AT A NEW REFRIGERATOR

02:05:50.042 --> 02:05:50.643
AND I KIND OF WHAT WE SHOULD BUY

02:05:50.709 --> 02:05:51.277
IT NOW BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE

02:05:51.343 --> 02:05:52.478
CHEAPER NOW THAN IF WE WAIT A

02:05:52.544 --> 02:05:53.846
COUPLE OF MONTHS AND I THINK.

02:05:53.913 --> 02:05:55.614
THOSE ARE SOME DECISIONS THAT

02:05:55.681 --> 02:05:57.283
CONSUMERS ARE GONNA HAVE TO MAKE

02:05:57.349 --> 02:05:58.617
BUT THEN THE OTHER PIECE OF THIS

02:05:58.684 --> 02:06:00.753
IS THAT AS RETAILERS ARE LOOKING

02:06:00.819 --> 02:06:02.354
TO CUT COSTS THAT ALSO MEANS

02:06:02.421 --> 02:06:03.856
CUTTING JOBS.

02:06:03.923 --> 02:06:05.324
YOU KNOW ONCE YOU COULD HAVE

02:06:05.391 --> 02:06:07.860
CALIFORNIANS WHO WHO WORK IN THE

02:06:07.927 --> 02:06:09.194
RETAIL INDUSTRY.

02:06:09.261 --> 02:06:11.196
NOT HAVING A JOB ANYMORE AND

02:06:11.263 --> 02:06:12.665
THEN WHAT DOES THAT DO THAT ADDS

02:06:12.731 --> 02:06:14.533
TO THE PROBLEM AND IT HAS A

02:06:14.600 --> 02:06:16.335
BIGGER IMPACT IN SO WE REALLY

02:06:16.402 --> 02:06:17.670
THINK THAT SEEING.

02:06:17.736 --> 02:06:21.040
WE HOPE SOME POSITIVE IN ROADS

02:06:21.106 --> 02:06:22.074
WITH THESE TARIFFS CALM BECAUSE

02:06:22.141 --> 02:06:23.475
I DON'T THINK WE'VE REALLY

02:06:23.542 --> 02:06:25.811
UNDERSTAND WHAT IMPACT IS TRULY

02:06:25.878 --> 02:06:27.079
GOING TO HAVE.

02:06:27.146 --> 02:06:29.048
UNLESS THEY CAN YOU KNOW

02:06:29.114 --> 02:06:31.717
PROLONGS THE HIPS AND WINTER

02:06:31.784 --> 02:06:32.952
COATS COMING WELL I DEFINITELY

02:06:33.018 --> 02:06:34.353
WANT TO PASS OVER -- TO IT TO

02:06:34.420 --> 02:06:35.187
YOU MISTER DAVIS BECAUSE MS

02:06:35.254 --> 02:06:35.955
MICHELIN MENTIONED.

02:06:36.021 --> 02:06:38.390
APPLIANCES REFRIGERATORS TALK

02:06:38.457 --> 02:06:40.793
ABOUT STORAGE -- YOU KNOW WHAT'S

02:06:40.859 --> 02:06:42.428
COMING OVER AND CARGO SHIPS IS

02:06:42.494 --> 02:06:46.231
THERE A A SECTOR THAT YOUR SCENE --

02:06:46.298 --> 02:06:48.567
OR DID SEE MORE OF THAT TYPE OF

02:06:48.634 --> 02:06:50.736
SHIPMENT COMING IN TO GET IN

02:06:50.803 --> 02:06:52.104
AHEAD OF THOSE TERRORISTS FOR

02:06:52.171 --> 02:06:53.572
THAT TYPE OF BEHAVIOR NOT OCCUR.

02:06:53.639 --> 02:06:54.673
I THINK THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION

02:06:54.740 --> 02:06:55.908
UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T HAVE I

02:06:55.975 --> 02:06:56.709
DON'T THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH

02:06:56.775 --> 02:06:58.444
DISABILITY AT LEAST AT THE PORT

02:06:58.510 --> 02:06:59.778
LEVEL THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT

02:06:59.845 --> 02:07:01.947
DIFFERENT METRICS THAT ARE USED --

02:07:02.014 --> 02:07:03.816
YOU CAN MEASURE AND BE OF VALUE

02:07:03.882 --> 02:07:06.418
VOLUME TONNAGE CONTAINERS SO I

02:07:06.485 --> 02:07:08.120
THINK I'D REALLY SORT OF WANTED

02:07:08.187 --> 02:07:08.754
TO FOR TO SOME OF THE INDIVIDUAL

02:07:08.821 --> 02:07:11.724
SORT OF SECTORS DISORDER REALLY

02:07:11.790 --> 02:07:12.925
DID YOU KNOW.

02:07:12.992 --> 02:07:14.393
TELL US WHERE THEY'RE SAYING AND

02:07:14.460 --> 02:07:16.328
I THINK FROM A AN OVERALL LEVEL

02:07:16.395 --> 02:07:19.264
WE SAW JUST A MARKET SURGE AND

02:07:19.331 --> 02:07:20.899
WE WERE HEARING AT LEAST FROM.

02:07:20.966 --> 02:07:22.368
ON EVERY CONCEIVABLE TYPE OF

02:07:22.434 --> 02:07:23.402
SECTOR WEATHER WAS BASIC

02:07:23.469 --> 02:07:25.437
MANUFACTURING THE RETAIL

02:07:25.504 --> 02:07:27.106
ENVIRONMENT FROM TACK JUST

02:07:27.172 --> 02:07:27.873
PEOPLE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

02:07:27.940 --> 02:07:29.341
BECAUSE AGAIN AT THE PORT LEVEL

02:07:29.408 --> 02:07:30.309
IT WAS.

02:07:30.376 --> 02:07:31.610
STARTING TO MANIFEST ITSELF

02:07:31.677 --> 02:07:34.213
THROUGH -- BOXES THAT WE WEREN'T

02:07:34.279 --> 02:07:36.015
EXPECTING IN THE REGULAR CYCLE

02:07:36.081 --> 02:07:38.017
THAT WERE COMING IN OFF SEASON --

02:07:38.083 --> 02:07:46.158
SURE IN THE COMING IN SIX MONTHS

02:07:46.225 --> 02:07:46.759
EARLY THAN WHAT WE WOULD HAVE

02:07:46.825 --> 02:07:48.293
THOUGHT THAT NORMAL SO MICHAEL

02:07:48.360 --> 02:07:49.194
WOULD LOOK LIKE AND SO THEY WERE

02:07:49.261 --> 02:07:50.429
GETTING FOR IT BURIED IN A STACK

02:07:50.496 --> 02:07:51.130
AND IT LED TO YOU KNOW.

02:07:51.196 --> 02:07:53.198
LITERALLY HAVING TO TRIAGE EVERY

02:07:53.265 --> 02:07:54.066
SENSE SINGLE CAR.

02:07:54.133 --> 02:07:55.934
WHICH IS NOT HOW WE ONE

02:07:56.001 --> 02:07:56.502
INTRODUCE OURSELVES TO THE

02:07:56.568 --> 02:07:57.102
SHIPPING LINES IN ON THAT KIND

02:07:57.169 --> 02:07:57.736
OF BIGGER PICTURE TRAFFIC ISSUE

02:07:57.803 --> 02:07:58.303
ARE YOU SEEN CONTAINER SHIPS

02:07:58.370 --> 02:07:58.904
COMING IN FROM DIFFERENT PORTS

02:07:58.971 --> 02:07:59.872
ARE GOING OUT TO DIFFERENT PORTS

02:07:59.938 --> 02:08:02.841
THEN THE CROSS SPECIFIC CHINA --

02:08:02.908 --> 02:08:04.610
CALIFORNIA A TRADE I DON'T THINK

02:08:04.676 --> 02:08:06.178
WE'VE SEEN ANY MAJOR DISRUPTIONS

02:08:06.245 --> 02:08:07.346
IN THE ACTUAL STRINGS FOR THE

02:08:07.413 --> 02:08:08.847
SHIPPING ROUTES I THINK WE'RE

02:08:08.914 --> 02:08:10.749
OBVIOUSLY JUST SEEING --

02:08:10.816 --> 02:08:13.218
DIFFERENT VOLUMES IN VARYING

02:08:13.285 --> 02:08:14.887
LEVELS AGAIN LIKE WE'RE SEEING A

02:08:14.953 --> 02:08:16.755
SURGEON IN EMPTY BOXES THAT ARE

02:08:16.822 --> 02:08:17.790
NOW YOU KNOW.

02:08:17.856 --> 02:08:19.425
MAKING A WAY BACK ACROSS THE

02:08:19.491 --> 02:08:21.794
PACIFIC SO ON TAXES NOT ADDING A

02:08:21.860 --> 02:08:23.829
LOT OF VALUE TO THE WORK THAT WE

02:08:23.896 --> 02:08:25.297
DO WERE CERTAINLY TO OUR ECONOMY --

02:08:25.364 --> 02:08:26.799
WE LIKE TO EE THOSE BOXES GO

02:08:26.865 --> 02:08:28.667
BACK FULL OF GOODS BE EITHER

02:08:28.734 --> 02:08:30.169
FROM A MANUFACTURED STANDPOINT

02:08:30.235 --> 02:08:31.370
AG STANDPOINT.

02:08:31.437 --> 02:08:33.338
SO -- NO STRINGS HAVE BEEN

02:08:33.405 --> 02:08:34.506
IMPACTED THIS POINT WE DID

02:08:34.573 --> 02:08:36.175
ACTUALLY SEE LAST YEAR THOUGH

02:08:36.241 --> 02:08:38.177
AND BECAUSE OF THAT BACK UP -- A

02:08:38.243 --> 02:08:39.278
COUPLE OF THE LINES THAT WOULD

02:08:39.344 --> 02:08:40.479
NORMALLY SAY GO TO LIKE LOS

02:08:40.546 --> 02:08:41.914
ANGELES AND THEN OAKLAND AND

02:08:41.980 --> 02:08:43.482
THEN BACK TO ASIA THEY WOULD

02:08:43.549 --> 02:08:44.583
JUST SKIP AROUND ENTIRELY

02:08:44.650 --> 02:08:46.618
BECAUSE THEY WERE NEEDING TO

02:08:46.685 --> 02:08:48.020
MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE -- ON

02:08:48.087 --> 02:08:50.222
SCHEDULE FOR THEIR NEXT FOR THE

02:08:50.289 --> 02:08:51.190
NEXT APPOINTMENT.

02:08:51.256 --> 02:08:52.157
WE DO A LABOR REPRESENTATIVE IN

02:08:52.224 --> 02:08:53.592
THE NEXT PANEL DO YOU HAVE A

02:08:53.659 --> 02:08:55.027
SENSE OF HOW THIS IS IMPACTING

02:08:55.094 --> 02:08:57.296
JOBS WITH RELATED -- TO INCREASE

02:08:57.362 --> 02:08:59.098
OR DECREASE OF TRAFFIC YEAH WILL

02:08:59.164 --> 02:09:00.132
CERTAINLY FROM A PORT

02:09:00.199 --> 02:09:01.266
PERSPECTIVE I THINK THAT THERE'S

02:09:01.333 --> 02:09:02.701
ENOUGH BUSINESS TO GO AROUND SO

02:09:02.768 --> 02:09:04.303
WE HAVEN'T SEEN TURN OF ANY.

02:09:04.369 --> 02:09:06.038
YOU KNOW BACKUPS OF FOLKS NOT

02:09:06.105 --> 02:09:06.872
BEING CALLED OUT TO THE

02:09:06.939 --> 02:09:08.440
TERMINALS -- CERTAINLY AS IT

02:09:08.507 --> 02:09:09.942
AFFECTS THE ECOSYSTEM --

02:09:10.008 --> 02:09:10.809
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE SUPPLY

02:09:10.876 --> 02:09:13.245
CHAIN I MEAN IN THE SHORT TERM

02:09:13.312 --> 02:09:14.513
IT MAY BE HARD TO MEASURE IT

02:09:14.580 --> 02:09:16.148
THIS WAY TO CONTINUE OVER THE

02:09:16.215 --> 02:09:16.815
LONG TERM THAT'S AND OUT OF ALL

02:09:16.882 --> 02:09:17.015
THAT.

02:09:17.082 --> 02:09:18.550
THAT THIS IS GOING TO HAVE LONG

02:09:18.617 --> 02:09:24.556
TERM IMPACTS TO OUR ECONOMY AND

02:09:24.623 --> 02:09:27.559
CERTAINLY TO OUR WORK FORCE.

02:09:27.626 --> 02:09:28.060
THE SERVER MISS JENSEN.

02:09:28.127 --> 02:09:28.560
I THINK FROM A CONSUMER

02:09:28.627 --> 02:09:30.329
PERSPECTIVE WE SEE UNDERSTAND

02:09:30.395 --> 02:09:32.064
LIKE WAVES OF OF TRADE IF WE

02:09:32.131 --> 02:09:33.465
THINK ABOUT IT THIS DEEPLY WHEN

02:09:33.532 --> 02:09:34.900
THE NEW A CELLPHONE COMES OUT.

02:09:34.967 --> 02:09:37.302
AND OKAY THERE'S A NEW GALAXY OR

02:09:37.369 --> 02:09:39.238
THERE'S A NEW IPHONE -- THIS IS

02:09:39.304 --> 02:09:40.873
GONNA BE CERTAIN SEASONS FOR

02:09:40.939 --> 02:09:42.541
THIS IS GOING TO OCCUR AROUND

02:09:42.608 --> 02:09:44.409
YOU KNOW CHRISTMAS TIME TYPE OF

02:09:44.476 --> 02:09:49.615
SALES AS WELL FOR FOR BIG ITEMS --

02:09:49.681 --> 02:09:51.450
AND SO YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE DOES

02:09:51.517 --> 02:09:53.118
THAT PRESSURE POINT HIT SOME OF

02:09:53.185 --> 02:09:55.120
YOUR MEMBERS THAT ARE DEALING

02:09:55.187 --> 02:09:56.622
WITH THAT TYPE OF A TECHNOLOGY

02:09:56.688 --> 02:09:57.189
YOU'RE LOOKING TO PUSH THEIR

02:09:57.256 --> 02:09:58.957
TECHNOLOGY OUT.

02:09:59.024 --> 02:10:00.559
ON THOSE NEW MODELS.

02:10:00.626 --> 02:10:01.793
YEAH I THINK YOU KNOW WE'RE

02:10:01.860 --> 02:10:04.730
STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE

02:10:04.796 --> 02:10:06.231
SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM IMPACTS

02:10:06.298 --> 02:10:07.266
I MEAN I THINK WE'RE ALL HOPING

02:10:07.332 --> 02:10:09.768
THIS GETS DEALT WITH QUICK.

02:10:09.835 --> 02:10:11.470
SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE THOSE

02:10:11.537 --> 02:10:13.338
IMPACTS RIGHT -- THOSE YOU KNOW

02:10:13.405 --> 02:10:14.973
VERY EXPENSIVE IMPACTS I THINK

02:10:15.040 --> 02:10:16.542
THERE'S IMPACTS FROM A

02:10:16.608 --> 02:10:18.377
INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER HOUSEHOLD

02:10:18.443 --> 02:10:20.179
STANDPOINT AND THEN ALSO ON OUR

02:10:20.245 --> 02:10:21.847
BUSINESSES RIGHT BECAUSE

02:10:21.914 --> 02:10:23.682
TECHNOLOGY IS USED.

02:10:23.749 --> 02:10:25.317
AS YOU KNOW I STATE MY COMMENTS

02:10:25.384 --> 02:10:26.585
BUT IT TECHNOLOGIES USE FROM A

02:10:26.652 --> 02:10:27.819
PERSONAL STANDPOINT YOUR

02:10:27.886 --> 02:10:29.755
PERSONAL USE OF YOURSELF ON ALL

02:10:29.821 --> 02:10:31.056
THOSE OTHER THINGS BUT

02:10:31.123 --> 02:10:32.457
TECHNOLOGIES ALSO USED BY OUR

02:10:32.524 --> 02:10:34.259
BUSINESSES IN ORDER TO CREATE

02:10:34.326 --> 02:10:36.061
MORE JOBS IN CALIFORNIA TO DO

02:10:36.128 --> 02:10:37.462
MORE EFFICIENCY.

02:10:37.529 --> 02:10:38.463
AND SO I THINK THAT'S WHERE

02:10:38.530 --> 02:10:39.698
WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF THE IMPACT

02:10:39.765 --> 02:10:40.933
AND WE'VE BEEN SEEING THE

02:10:40.999 --> 02:10:42.401
IMPACTS FROM TERRACE AND FROM

02:10:42.467 --> 02:10:43.969
SORT OF THE UNFAIR TRADE

02:10:44.036 --> 02:10:46.705
PRACTICES AND TO THOSE TYPES OF

02:10:46.772 --> 02:10:49.374
DATA CENTERS TO THE LARGER

02:10:49.441 --> 02:10:51.810
TECHNOLOGY -- PROJECTS THAT HAVE

02:10:51.877 --> 02:10:53.679
BEEN GOING ON THAT BUSINESS TO

02:10:53.745 --> 02:10:56.548
BUSINESS USAGE -- AND THEN WHEN

02:10:56.615 --> 02:10:57.916
WE DRILL DOWN OF THIS TERROR FOR

02:10:57.983 --> 02:10:59.585
CONTINUES LONG TERM WE'RE GONNA

02:10:59.651 --> 02:11:01.587
SEE IMPACTS AND WE'RE GONNA SEE

02:11:01.653 --> 02:11:03.188
COSTS GO UP FOR THE INDIVIDUAL

02:11:03.255 --> 02:11:04.790
CONSUMER DO YOU SEE A SHIFT IN

02:11:04.856 --> 02:11:06.358
WERE COMPONENTS ARE MANUFACTURED.

02:11:06.425 --> 02:11:10.862
SORRY SAID DO YOU SEE A SHIFT

02:11:10.929 --> 02:11:11.964
WORK COMPONENTS ARE MANUFACTURED.

02:11:12.030 --> 02:11:13.465
IT'S ALWAYS AN OPTION RIGHT OF

02:11:13.532 --> 02:11:14.066
WHERE IT'S MANUFACTURED IF IT

02:11:14.132 --> 02:11:14.533
GETS TOO EXPENSIVE TO

02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:15.334
MANUFACTURE THEM IN CALIFORNIA

02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:16.868
YEAH I COULD SEE YOU KNOW

02:11:16.935 --> 02:11:19.738
MANUFACTURING -- HAPPENED FOR

02:11:19.805 --> 02:11:20.839
USING PARTS ARE MANUFACTURED IN

02:11:20.906 --> 02:11:22.975
OTHER COUNTRIES OR MOVING DATA

02:11:23.041 --> 02:11:25.043
CENTER MANUFACTURING TO OTHER

02:11:25.110 --> 02:11:26.979
COUNTRIES I'M YOU KNOW PRODUCING

02:11:27.045 --> 02:11:28.714
THOSE IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES I

02:11:28.780 --> 02:11:30.349
MEAN IT IF THOSE THIS LONG TERM

02:11:30.415 --> 02:11:31.583
TRADE WORK GOES ON I THINK

02:11:31.650 --> 02:11:32.784
BUSINESSES ARE REALLY GOING TO

02:11:32.851 --> 02:11:34.052
HAVE TO FIGURE OUT.

02:11:34.119 --> 02:11:35.354
SORT OF WHAT THEIR BREAKING

02:11:35.420 --> 02:11:37.356
POINT IS I AM AND WHAT CONSUMERS

02:11:37.422 --> 02:11:39.057
BREAKING POINT AS TO I MEAN IF

02:11:39.124 --> 02:11:41.326
WE IF WE CONTINUE TO MANUFACTURE

02:11:41.393 --> 02:11:42.894
HERE BUT WE PUT IT OUT ON THE

02:11:42.961 --> 02:11:45.130
MARKET AND IT'S NOT AFFORDABLE

02:11:45.197 --> 02:11:46.965
FOR THE AVERAGE CONSUMER.

02:11:47.032 --> 02:11:47.866
AND THEN THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR

02:11:47.933 --> 02:11:51.069
ANYBODY AND SO THERE'S GONNA BE

02:11:51.136 --> 02:11:52.204
A BREAKING POINT AT SOME POINT.

02:11:52.271 --> 02:11:54.339
MEMBERS ANY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.

02:11:54.406 --> 02:11:56.375

02:11:59.945 --> 02:12:03.815
COMMENT -- WE WE TEND TO LOOK AT

02:12:03.882 --> 02:12:05.017
THESE ISSUES ARE OUR OWN EYES

AND THESE FOLKS ARE ALREADY

02:13:15.087 --> 02:13:16.922

THE TERROR OF SUN CHINA HAVE

BEEN A SIGNIFICANT DETERRENT. TO

02:15:11.703 --> 02:15:13.171

ROUTES TO MARKET FOR OUR WINDS

02:15:31.990 --> 02:15:33.458

WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE

02:15:34.759 --> 02:15:36.461

CALIFORNIA WINE IN THESE MARKETS.

02:15:49.074 --> 02:15:51.409
IS HAS BEEN GREATLY HAMPERED.

02:15:51.476 --> 02:15:53.778
BY WHAT WE'RE SEEING GOING ON IN

02:15:53.845 --> 02:15:55.347
TRADE POLICY CURRENTLY.

02:15:55.413 --> 02:15:58.083
CHINA -- IN TWO THOUSAND

02:15:58.149 --> 02:15:59.684
EIGHTEEN REPRESENTED JUST OVER

02:15:59.751 --> 02:16:00.285
SIXTY JUST.

02:16:00.352 --> 02:16:01.753
UNDER SIXTY EIGHT MILLION

02:16:01.820 --> 02:16:03.522
DOLLARS IN EXPORTS AND COMBINED

02:16:03.588 --> 02:16:05.123
WITH HONG KONG ANOTHER A HUNDRED

02:16:05.190 --> 02:16:06.825
AND THIRTY MILLION TO ALMOST TWO

02:16:06.892 --> 02:16:07.392
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN

02:16:07.459 --> 02:16:08.360
EXPORT.

02:16:08.426 --> 02:16:09.828
AT THE END OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE

02:16:09.895 --> 02:16:12.097
SAW THAT SALES GROWTH DECLINED

02:16:12.163 --> 02:16:13.164
BY 25%.

02:16:13.231 --> 02:16:14.666
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE FIRST

02:16:14.733 --> 02:16:17.269
QUARTER OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN

02:16:17.335 --> 02:16:19.471
OR SAYING THAT TRENDS CONTINUE

02:16:19.538 --> 02:16:22.240
AT ALMOST DOUBLE? SEVEN DECLINE

02:16:22.307 --> 02:16:27.579
ALMOST DOUBLE [inaudible]

02:16:27.646 --> 02:16:34.052
SOBERING -- AND WHAT'S

02:16:34.119 --> 02:16:36.288
SIGNIFICANT IN TERMS OF THAT

02:16:36.354 --> 02:16:38.657
DECLINE IS THE PRIOR TO THAT WE

02:16:38.723 --> 02:16:40.659
WERE SEEING CHINA AND HONG KONG

02:16:40.725 --> 02:16:41.560
TOGETHER.

02:16:41.626 --> 02:16:43.061
BEING ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING

02:16:43.128 --> 02:16:44.896
MARKETS THAT -- IN THE TIME THAT

02:16:44.963 --> 02:16:46.364
WE'VE BEEN EXPORTING HAD GROWN

02:16:46.431 --> 02:16:48.800
OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND 50%.

02:16:48.867 --> 02:16:50.168
IN GROWTH OVER THE PAST DECADE

02:16:50.235 --> 02:16:51.803
SO.

02:16:51.870 --> 02:16:55.607
A COMPLETE REVERSAL -- AS WE'RE

02:16:55.674 --> 02:16:57.042
GOING FORWARD AND I I JUST

02:16:57.108 --> 02:16:58.977
TOUCHED ON THE VALUE OF THE

02:16:59.044 --> 02:17:00.845
REVENUES OF EXPORT WINDS TO

02:17:00.912 --> 02:17:02.581
CHINA AND HONG KONG.

02:17:02.647 --> 02:17:05.817
AND THAT THAT GROWTH REPRESENTED

02:17:05.884 --> 02:17:07.752
OVERALL -- THE LIEUTENANT

02:17:07.819 --> 02:17:09.020
GOVERNOR DID AN EXCELLENT JOB OF

02:17:09.087 --> 02:17:11.523
WALKING THROUGH THE EVOLUTION OF

02:17:11.590 --> 02:17:13.558
TERRORISTS THAT WE'VE SEEN OVER

02:17:13.625 --> 02:17:17.095
THE RECENT. TWO YEARS AND WHAT'S

02:17:17.162 --> 02:17:18.496
INTERESTING IS COMPARING THAT IS

02:17:18.563 --> 02:17:20.932
SHE TALKED ABOUT THE

02:17:20.999 --> 02:17:23.868
ACCUMULATION OF TERROR FROM TAX

02:17:23.935 --> 02:17:25.537
AGAINST GOODS WITHIN THE WINE

02:17:25.604 --> 02:17:27.505
INDUSTRY ONE OF THE CHALLENGES

02:17:27.572 --> 02:17:29.341
THAT WE OF COURSE ARE GOING HEAD

02:17:29.407 --> 02:17:31.710
TO HEAD.

02:17:31.776 --> 02:17:32.978
WITH COMPETITIVE WINE REGIONS.

02:17:33.044 --> 02:17:33.745
OF COURSE OUR FRIENDS OVER IN

02:17:33.812 --> 02:17:36.114
THE E. U. AUSTRALIA AND NEW

02:17:36.181 --> 02:17:38.149
ZEALAND AT CETERA.

02:17:38.216 --> 02:17:40.352
SOUTH AFRICA ABSOLUTELY AND SO

02:17:40.418 --> 02:17:43.688
IN THIS ENVIRONMENT -- WE ARE WE

02:17:43.755 --> 02:17:44.856
FIND OURSELVES PLAYING AND NOT

02:17:44.923 --> 02:17:48.593
ON AN EVEN A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD --

02:17:48.660 --> 02:17:50.528
THE COMBINATION OF TERROR OF SIN

02:17:50.595 --> 02:17:53.298
TAXES -- THAT WE WERE DEALING

02:17:53.365 --> 02:17:55.667
WITH -- HAS NOW IT WOULD

02:17:55.734 --> 02:17:59.270
INCREASED UP TO A 93% ON TOP OF

02:17:59.337 --> 02:18:00.972
THE THE PRICE OF GOODS ALMOST

02:18:01.039 --> 02:18:02.874
DOUBLING THE COST OF CALIFORNIA

02:18:02.941 --> 02:18:03.541
WINE.

02:18:03.608 --> 02:18:05.443
INTO CHINA AND FOR OUR

02:18:05.510 --> 02:18:07.746
COMPETITIVE REGION'S THOSE

02:18:07.812 --> 02:18:08.680
REGIONS MANY OF THEM SO

02:18:08.747 --> 02:18:10.515
AUSTRALIA CHILE AND NEW ZEALAND

02:18:10.582 --> 02:18:11.650
IN PARTICULAR.

02:18:11.716 --> 02:18:14.286
THEY HAVE ZERO TARIFF THERE

02:18:14.352 --> 02:18:17.989
REALLY ONLY FACING -- TAX THAT

02:18:18.056 --> 02:18:19.290
LEADS 223%.

02:18:19.357 --> 02:18:21.526
WHEREAS FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION

02:18:21.593 --> 02:18:23.361
THERE ARE A TOTAL OF FORTY EIGHT

02:18:23.428 --> 02:18:26.464
POINT 6% SO WE ARE MORE THAN

02:18:26.531 --> 02:18:29.267
DOUBLE EVEN OUR CLOSEST

02:18:29.334 --> 02:18:30.335
COMPETITORS.

02:18:30.402 --> 02:18:31.903
SIMULTANEOUSLY WE'RE DEALING

02:18:31.970 --> 02:18:33.371
WITH AN ENVIRONMENT WHICH MANY

02:18:33.438 --> 02:18:34.939
OF OUR COMPETITIVE REGIONS HAVE

02:18:35.006 --> 02:18:37.142
SIGNIFICANT GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES

02:18:37.208 --> 02:18:38.510
SUPPORTING THEIR MARKETING

02:18:38.576 --> 02:18:40.245
EFFORTS INTO THOSE MARKETS. FOR

02:18:40.311 --> 02:18:43.648
EXAMPLE US WINE OPERATES AT JUST

02:18:43.715 --> 02:18:46.685
3% OF WHAT THE E. U. RECEIVES

02:18:46.751 --> 02:18:48.553
PARTICULARLY ITALY AND FRANCE

02:18:48.620 --> 02:18:49.454
FOR SUPPORTING THEIR MARKETING

02:18:49.521 --> 02:18:51.022
EFFORTS WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT

02:18:51.089 --> 02:18:53.124
RECEIVING TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY

02:18:53.191 --> 02:18:54.726
EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY.

02:18:54.793 --> 02:18:57.062
TO SUPPORT WINE EXPORT SALES

02:18:57.128 --> 02:18:58.897
COMPARED TO THE SIX MILLION

02:18:58.963 --> 02:19:00.432
DOLLARS THAT CALIFORNIA RECEIVES

02:19:00.498 --> 02:19:03.001
FROM THE FEDERAL AGRICULTURE

02:19:03.068 --> 02:19:04.135
SERVICE TO SUPPORT OUR SALES.

02:19:04.202 --> 02:19:06.738
SO IN LIGHT OF THAT.

02:19:06.805 --> 02:19:08.306
THE ADDITION OF THE TAX ENTIRE

02:19:08.373 --> 02:19:10.275
SITUATION IS PARTICULARLY

02:19:10.341 --> 02:19:12.944
CHALLENGING FOR US.

02:19:13.011 --> 02:19:14.546
AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE

02:19:14.612 --> 02:19:17.015
IMPACTS OF HOW THIS AFFECTS THE

02:19:17.082 --> 02:19:19.617
INDUSTRY IT DOESN'T CHEST FLOW.

02:19:19.684 --> 02:19:21.519
TO THE WINERY OWNERS OR THE

02:19:21.586 --> 02:19:23.888
WINERIES THEMSELVES AS IT WAS SO

02:19:23.955 --> 02:19:25.290
INTERESTING TO SIT AND LISTEN TO

02:19:25.356 --> 02:19:27.258
OUR COLLEAGUES -- IN THE FIRST

02:19:27.325 --> 02:19:28.193
PANEL I'M LOOKING AT MY

02:19:28.259 --> 02:19:29.627
COLLEAGUES ON THIS PANEL AND

02:19:29.694 --> 02:19:31.162
THAT THE WINE INDUSTRY IS UNIQUE

02:19:31.229 --> 02:19:34.032
IN THAT I SIT AND LINK ARMS AND

02:19:34.099 --> 02:19:36.201
PARTNER WITH EACH OF THEIR

02:19:36.267 --> 02:19:36.468
PARTNERS.

02:19:36.534 --> 02:19:39.070
THE PORTS COURSE THE RETAILERS

02:19:39.137 --> 02:19:41.239
TECHNOLOGY THE INVOLVEMENT OF

02:19:41.306 --> 02:19:43.274
TECHNOLOGY IN THE WINE INDUSTRY

02:19:43.341 --> 02:19:45.009
OF COURSE THE GROWERS AND LABOR.

02:19:45.076 --> 02:19:47.378
ARE KEY FACTORS WITHIN THE WINE

02:19:47.445 --> 02:19:49.080
INDUSTRY AND SO THE IMPACT OF

02:19:49.147 --> 02:19:50.749
THESE TEARS FLOW ALL THE WAY

02:19:50.815 --> 02:19:52.183
THROUGH THE WINE INDUSTRY

02:19:52.250 --> 02:19:52.984
IMPACTING.

02:19:53.051 --> 02:19:54.986
THE THE VINEYARD OWNERS AND THE

02:19:55.053 --> 02:19:58.089
GROWERS -- AT THE WINERY WORKERS

02:19:58.156 --> 02:20:00.091
THE SUPPLIERS THAT WE WORK WITH

02:20:00.158 --> 02:20:01.960
IN TERMS OF GLASS CORK SHIPPING

02:20:02.026 --> 02:20:05.196
LABEL PRODUCTION OF COURSE LABOR.

02:20:05.263 --> 02:20:07.132
THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF WINE AS A

02:20:07.198 --> 02:20:10.268
VALUE ADDED PRODUCT FAR EXCEEDS.

02:20:10.335 --> 02:20:12.003
JUST THE GROSS PRODUCTION OF

02:20:12.070 --> 02:20:13.271
WHAT WE DO.

02:20:13.338 --> 02:20:18.543
SO THESE IMPACTS ARE -- HAVE A

02:20:18.610 --> 02:20:19.577
HAVE A BIGGER FOOT PRINT.

02:20:19.644 --> 02:20:20.912
IT WITHIN THE MARKET AND HERE

02:20:20.979 --> 02:20:22.380
WITH IN CALIFORNIA.

02:20:22.447 --> 02:20:24.215
SIGNIFICANTLY THAT ALSO AS I

02:20:24.282 --> 02:20:25.784
MENTIONED IT TAKES TIME TO

02:20:25.850 --> 02:20:26.818
DEVELOP THESE MARKETS AS I

02:20:26.885 --> 02:20:27.986
MENTIONED WE'VE BEEN WORKING FOR

02:20:28.052 --> 02:20:29.921
OVER TWENTY YEARS TO CULTIVATE

02:20:29.988 --> 02:20:31.956
OUR SALES INTO CHINA IT ALSO

02:20:32.023 --> 02:20:34.492
TAKES TIME TO THEN REVERSE THE

02:20:34.559 --> 02:20:35.860
IMPACTS OF THESE TERRORISTS.

02:20:35.927 --> 02:20:37.629
IF THESE TERRORISTS WERE TO BE

02:20:37.695 --> 02:20:38.897
REMOVED TOMORROW.

02:20:38.963 --> 02:20:40.932
WHICH WOULD BE A BLESSING BUT WE

02:20:40.999 --> 02:20:42.467
KNOW A LONG SHOT.

02:20:42.534 --> 02:20:44.435
IT WOULD TAKE ANOTHER TEN PLUS

02:20:44.502 --> 02:20:47.105
YEARS TO REGAIN THE PLACEMENT IN

02:20:47.172 --> 02:20:48.807
THE SALES BACK INTO CHINA THE

02:20:48.873 --> 02:20:51.109
REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE FIRST

02:20:51.176 --> 02:20:52.076
AND FOREMOST.

02:20:52.143 --> 02:20:53.478
IT'S BUILT ON RELATIONSHIPS

02:20:53.545 --> 02:20:55.180
CULTIVATING RELATIONSHIPS WITH

02:20:55.246 --> 02:20:56.981
THE IMPORTERS THE AGENTS AND THE

02:20:57.048 --> 02:20:58.716
ACCOUNTS WHERE WE SELL OUR WINDS

02:20:58.783 --> 02:21:00.251
ONCE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS ARE

02:21:00.318 --> 02:21:02.220
DAMAGE THEY NEED TO BE REBUILT

02:21:02.287 --> 02:21:03.655
ALSO.

02:21:03.721 --> 02:21:05.790
THE PURCHASE OF WINE IS A CHOICE

02:21:05.857 --> 02:21:07.458
AND THERE'S A LOT OF CHOICE OUT

02:21:07.525 --> 02:21:08.960
THERE IN THE MARKET PLACE IT'S A

02:21:09.027 --> 02:21:11.095
CHOICE BY THE RETAILER OR THE

02:21:11.162 --> 02:21:12.997
IMPORTER WHO BRINGS AS WINDS IN

02:21:13.064 --> 02:21:14.432
IT'S A CHOICE BY THE CONSUMER.

02:21:14.499 --> 02:21:16.301
SO OF CALIFORNIA WINE IS NO

02:21:16.367 --> 02:21:18.603
LONGER AVAILABLE IS NO LONGER IN

02:21:18.670 --> 02:21:20.505
THAT SHELF SPACE THERE IS

02:21:20.572 --> 02:21:22.607
ANOTHER WINE THAT REPLACES THAT

02:21:22.674 --> 02:21:23.775
FACE THAT WINDS COMING FROM

02:21:23.842 --> 02:21:25.043
AUSTRALIA.

02:21:25.109 --> 02:21:28.046
NEW ZEALAND CHILE ITALY OR

02:21:28.112 --> 02:21:29.747
FRANCE.

02:21:29.814 --> 02:21:32.383
SO TO REGAIN THOSE POSITIONS

02:21:32.450 --> 02:21:34.018
THAT'S WHAT TAKES TIME.

02:21:34.085 --> 02:21:36.988
AND WE WOULD -- DURING THIS TIME

02:21:37.055 --> 02:21:38.690
OF THE TERRACE NOT ONLY ARE WE

02:21:38.756 --> 02:21:41.826
LOSING OUT ON THE OPPORTUNITY OF

02:21:41.893 --> 02:21:43.862
THE CURRENT SALES WERE LOSING

02:21:43.928 --> 02:21:45.597
OUT ON THE DEVELOPMENTAL

02:21:45.663 --> 02:21:47.098
OPPORTUNITY OF THAT MARKET OVER

02:21:47.165 --> 02:21:49.567
THE NEXT FIVE TEN FIFTEEN YEARS

02:21:49.634 --> 02:21:51.502
SO IN FACT AS AN INDUSTRY WERE

02:21:51.569 --> 02:21:52.670
LOSING TWICE.

02:21:52.737 --> 02:21:55.139
WE'RE LOOKING TO REPLACE THESE

02:21:55.206 --> 02:21:56.140
SALES BY DEVELOPING OTHER

02:21:56.207 --> 02:21:58.343
MARKETS WITHIN ASIA HOWEVER IT'S

02:21:58.409 --> 02:22:00.745
DIFFICULT TO REPLACE THE FASTEST

02:22:00.812 --> 02:22:04.449
GROWING MARKET. FOR OUR INDUSTRY.

02:22:04.515 --> 02:22:08.286
TODAY WE'RE FACING WITHIN THE

02:22:08.353 --> 02:22:10.488
WINE INDUSTRY OUR CHALLENGES AND

02:22:10.555 --> 02:22:11.923
HEAD WINDS ACROSS ALL OF OUR

02:22:11.990 --> 02:22:13.057
MAJOR MARKETS.

02:22:13.124 --> 02:22:14.759
ARE SINGLE LARGEST EXPORT MARKET

02:22:14.826 --> 02:22:17.161
IS THAT -- THAT YOU YOU AND YOU

02:22:17.228 --> 02:22:18.630
CAN.

02:22:18.696 --> 02:22:20.999
WITH THE THREAT OF TERRACE

02:22:21.065 --> 02:22:22.333
WITHIN THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY

02:22:22.400 --> 02:22:24.135
RETALIATORY TARIFFS THERE ALONG

02:22:24.202 --> 02:22:25.403
WITH BREXIT.

02:22:25.470 --> 02:22:27.005
THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL HAD ONE OUR

02:22:27.071 --> 02:22:29.274
SECOND AND SINGLE LARGEST SINGLE

02:22:29.340 --> 02:22:30.775
MARKET IS CANADA.

02:22:30.842 --> 02:22:32.911
AND THE IMPACT AND THREAT OF

02:22:32.977 --> 02:22:34.379
TEARS THAT WE'VE BEEN DEALING

02:22:34.445 --> 02:22:36.281
WITH THEIR HONG KONG IS OUR

02:22:36.347 --> 02:22:38.850
THIRD LARGEST AND THE CHINA AS

02:22:38.917 --> 02:22:40.485
OUR FIFTH LARGEST AS I SAID.

02:22:40.551 --> 02:22:43.621
SO THIS IS -- A SITUATION WHERE

02:22:43.688 --> 02:22:47.725
THE IMPACTS ARE EXTENSIVE AND

02:22:47.792 --> 02:22:50.094
AND LASTING.

02:22:50.161 --> 02:22:52.964
AND ONE OF THE OTHER SIGNIFICANT

02:22:53.031 --> 02:22:55.333
CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE IS THAT

02:22:55.400 --> 02:22:57.568
AS THE PRICE OF OUR GOODS

02:22:57.635 --> 02:22:59.971
INCREASES IN THE MARKET PLACE WE

02:23:00.038 --> 02:23:02.440
DO NOT HAVE THE OPTION TO PICK

02:23:02.507 --> 02:23:03.675
UP AND FIND SOURCING IN A MORE

02:23:03.741 --> 02:23:05.176
AFFORDABLE PLACE.

02:23:05.243 --> 02:23:06.778
WE CAN'T PICK UP OUR VINEYARDS

02:23:06.844 --> 02:23:08.780
AND OUR WINERIES AND MOVE THEM

02:23:08.846 --> 02:23:10.381
SOMEPLACE ELSE.

02:23:10.448 --> 02:23:12.750
UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE TO EITHER

02:23:12.817 --> 02:23:15.386
RAISE OUR PRICES OR CUT

02:23:15.453 --> 02:23:17.355
PRODUCTION WE HAVE TO CUT THE

02:23:17.422 --> 02:23:18.890
PRICES THAT WERE WILLING TO PAY

02:23:18.957 --> 02:23:20.058
TO OUR GROWERS.

02:23:20.124 --> 02:23:23.127
WE HAVE TO REDUCE THE THE

02:23:23.194 --> 02:23:24.662
PRODUCTION THAT WE HAVE OVERALL

02:23:24.729 --> 02:23:27.065
AND THERE FOR WE HIRE FEWER

02:23:27.131 --> 02:23:28.967
BOTTLING LINES WE REDUCE OUR

02:23:29.033 --> 02:23:30.935
CELLAR STAFF WE PURCHASED FEWER

02:23:31.002 --> 02:23:33.471
GOODS SO IT REALLY IS A TRICKLE

02:23:33.538 --> 02:23:35.640
DOWN THROUGH THE ENTIRE SYSTEM.

02:23:35.707 --> 02:23:36.607
THAT'S THE IMPACT THAT WE HAVE

02:23:36.674 --> 02:23:36.908
[inaudible]

02:23:36.975 --> 02:23:38.242
SO.

02:23:38.309 --> 02:23:40.345
WELL WE ARE TAKING THE LONG TERM

02:23:40.411 --> 02:23:40.912
VIEW.

AND I'M BY NO MEANS ARE WE

02:23:42.914 --> 02:23:44.148

02:26:09.460 --> 02:26:11.662
UNDERSTAND WHERE IT CAN WORKING

02:26:11.729 --> 02:26:13.331
RIGHT IT PROBABLY CAN'T WORK AND

02:26:13.397 --> 02:26:15.233
THEN THAT GETS US INTO --

02:26:15.299 --> 02:26:18.503
DESIRED OUTCOMES.

02:26:18.569 --> 02:26:19.337
SOME OF THE THE DATE I'M GONNA

02:26:19.403 --> 02:26:20.104
PRESENT COME FOR OUR FRIENDS IN

02:26:20.171 --> 02:26:21.305
THE ALMOND SECTOR THE ALLMAN

02:26:21.372 --> 02:26:22.773
LIGHTS CALIFORNIA AMERICA

02:26:22.840 --> 02:26:23.741
STATURE GROWERS.

02:26:23.808 --> 02:26:24.542
SOME OF MY OTHER COLLEAGUES SO

02:26:24.609 --> 02:26:26.244
WANT TO GIVE THE PROPER CREDIT --

02:26:26.310 --> 02:26:27.478
I THINK WAS MENTIONED EARLIER

02:26:27.545 --> 02:26:30.248
ALMONDS EXPORT 67% OF THE CROP

02:26:30.314 --> 02:26:31.182
OUT OF CALIFORNIA.

02:26:31.249 --> 02:26:32.817
TERRACE OF ALREADY CAUSED A ONE

02:26:32.884 --> 02:26:34.685
THIRD REDUCTION.

02:26:34.752 --> 02:26:36.787
IN THOSE -- TONNAGE NUMBERS --

02:26:36.854 --> 02:26:39.657
IN AUSTRALIA BY THE WAY WHICH

02:26:39.724 --> 02:26:40.858
DIDN'T HAVE A HUGE ALMOND.

02:26:40.925 --> 02:26:42.994
CAPABILITY PRODUCTION CAPABILITY

02:26:43.060 --> 02:26:44.495
IS INCREASING IT QUICKLY THEY

02:26:44.562 --> 02:26:46.264
HAVE NOW INCREASED THEIR EXPORTS

02:26:46.330 --> 02:26:48.599
OF ALMONDS TO CHINA BY NEARLY

02:26:48.666 --> 02:26:49.767
2000%.

02:26:49.834 --> 02:26:50.835
NOW THAT'S COMING FROM SMALL

02:26:50.902 --> 02:26:53.204
BASE BUT IT TELLS YOU -- WHERE

02:26:53.271 --> 02:26:54.672
THEIR EYES AND WHERE THEIR HEADS

02:26:54.739 --> 02:26:57.375
ARE POINTED AND THEY'RE NOT THE

02:26:57.441 --> 02:26:59.343
ONLY ONES -- ALMOND TERRACE ARE

02:26:59.410 --> 02:27:01.012
NOW 50% ON BALK -- PRODUCT 20%

02:27:01.078 --> 02:27:03.548
ON PROCESSED OR CANNED PRODUCT.

02:27:03.614 --> 02:27:04.815
OPPOSITE THAT SHOWS BY THE WAY

02:27:04.882 --> 02:27:06.617
WAS MENTIONED EARLIER -- BY

02:27:06.684 --> 02:27:08.252
DOCTOR SUNDAR THAT BECAUSE IRAN

02:27:08.319 --> 02:27:10.655
HAD A FAILED CROP LAST YEAR OUR

02:27:10.721 --> 02:27:12.757
PISTACIA REYES LARGELY DODGED --

02:27:12.823 --> 02:27:14.692
THE IMPACTS FROM THE TERRACE I

02:27:14.759 --> 02:27:16.294
AND I THINK HE WAS VERY --

02:27:16.360 --> 02:27:17.828
APPROPRIATE IN IN NOTING THAT

02:27:17.895 --> 02:27:18.930
THAT IS NOT SOMETHING WE CAN

02:27:18.996 --> 02:27:21.766
COUNT ON THE TERRACE OF STASHES

02:27:21.832 --> 02:27:23.234
ARE NOW 45%.

02:27:23.301 --> 02:27:27.305
AND THAT WAS AT 5% PRIOR.

02:27:27.371 --> 02:27:28.272
SO THEY'RE IN HARM'S WAY -- I

02:27:28.339 --> 02:27:29.106
MENTION PECANS ALSO WE DO HAVE A

02:27:29.173 --> 02:27:30.107
LOT OF A CONTRADICTION IN

02:27:30.174 --> 02:27:32.276
CALIFORNIA BUT WE DO IN THE WEST

02:27:32.343 --> 02:27:33.678
IT STARTED IT'S A GROWTH

02:27:33.744 --> 02:27:35.880
INDUSTRY AND IN THAT SECTOR IN

02:27:35.947 --> 02:27:36.781
THE WEST A WESTERN PART OF THE

02:27:36.847 --> 02:27:39.083
U. S. -- THERE THE TERRACE AND

02:27:39.150 --> 02:27:40.685
GOT UP 2403% FROM I BELIEVE IT

02:27:40.751 --> 02:27:43.754
WAS A 47% I BELIEVE FROM SEVEN

02:27:43.821 --> 02:27:45.223
THEY'VE SEEN YEAR OVER YEAR.

02:27:45.289 --> 02:27:49.393
PRICES DROP BY 43% -- SO WE JUST

02:27:49.460 --> 02:27:51.028
SEE THIS THIS ACCUMULATION OF

02:27:51.095 --> 02:27:51.596
PRODUCT NOW WITH NO WHERE TO

02:27:51.662 --> 02:27:56.334
PARK IT -- AND THAT GOES.

02:27:56.400 --> 02:27:57.401
TO WITHIN THE DIVERSE ARRAY OF

02:27:57.468 --> 02:28:00.438
CALIFORNIA FARM PRODUCTS.

02:28:00.504 --> 02:28:01.606
I IT IS THE PERMANENT CROP

02:28:01.672 --> 02:28:04.075
PRODUCERS WHO ARE REALLY IN

02:28:04.141 --> 02:28:05.409
TROUBLE HERE IF THIS CONTINUES.

02:28:05.476 --> 02:28:06.477
ARE THEY CAN'T TURN THE TREES

02:28:06.544 --> 02:28:08.279
OFF THE CAN'T TURN THE VINES OFF

02:28:08.346 --> 02:28:09.747
THEY'RE GOING TO PRODUCE THAT.

02:28:09.814 --> 02:28:11.382
CROP AND YOU GOT TO FIND SOME

02:28:11.449 --> 02:28:14.185
PLACE TO PUT IT -- I WILL SAY

02:28:14.252 --> 02:28:15.152
THIS.

02:28:15.219 --> 02:28:16.787
THIS IS RESOLVING THE

02:28:16.854 --> 02:28:19.123
SATISFACTORILY IT IS OF COURSE

02:28:19.190 --> 02:28:20.524
CRITICAL FOR PERMANENT CROP

02:28:20.591 --> 02:28:21.425
FARMERS.

02:28:21.492 --> 02:28:22.560
BUT IT'S JUST AS CRITICAL FOR

02:28:22.627 --> 02:28:24.028
EVERY OTHER FARMING CALIFORNIA

02:28:24.095 --> 02:28:24.795
BECAUSE EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE

02:28:24.862 --> 02:28:26.330
LIKE ALMONDS EVERYBODY WANTS TO

02:28:26.397 --> 02:28:28.899
FIND THAT -- MARKET IN CHINA AND

02:28:28.966 --> 02:28:30.468
ELSEWHERE IN ASIA TO BE ABLE TO

02:28:30.534 --> 02:28:32.670
EXPORT AND ARE GET THE RETURNS

02:28:32.737 --> 02:28:33.804
THAT THE ALLMAN SECTOR AND

02:28:33.871 --> 02:28:35.339
STASHES SECTOR OF GOTTEN.

02:28:35.406 --> 02:28:37.808
IN CHINA SO THAT GETS ME INTO A

02:28:37.875 --> 02:28:39.477
QUICK DISCUSSION ABOUT THE USDA

02:28:39.543 --> 02:28:41.846
MITIGATION PROGRAMS THAT HAVE

02:28:41.912 --> 02:28:43.814
BEEN INITIATED THE FIRST WAS

02:28:43.881 --> 02:28:45.416
ANNOUNCED LAST YEAR AT TWELVE

02:28:45.483 --> 02:28:46.450
BILLION DOLLARS WAS LATER SCALED

02:28:46.517 --> 02:28:48.519
BACK TO ABOUT. TEN BILLION

02:28:48.586 --> 02:28:49.987
DOLLARS AND WAS NOTED EARLIER.

02:28:50.054 --> 02:28:52.623
BY OTHERS -- THAT PRIMARILY WENT

02:28:52.690 --> 02:28:54.992
TO MIDWESTERN SOYBEAN CORN WHEAT

02:28:55.059 --> 02:28:57.094
PRODUCERS PORK -- PRODUCERS A

02:28:57.161 --> 02:28:58.729
LITTLE BIT CAME TO OUR ALMOND --

02:28:58.796 --> 02:29:01.299
IN THAT PRISON CALIFORNIA BUT

02:29:01.365 --> 02:29:02.400
NOT VERY MUCH.

02:29:02.466 --> 02:29:03.467
THE SECOND TRYING TO THE SECOND

02:29:03.534 --> 02:29:04.735
PROGRAM JUST ANNOUNCED.

02:29:04.802 --> 02:29:06.404
A BY THE ADMINISTRATION IS

02:29:06.470 --> 02:29:08.472
SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS -- WITH

02:29:08.539 --> 02:29:09.573
FOURTEEN POINT FIVE BILLION

02:29:09.640 --> 02:29:11.342
GOING TO MARKET FACILITATION

02:29:11.409 --> 02:29:13.511
WHICH IS ANOTHER WAY OF SAY THE

02:29:13.577 --> 02:29:15.713
SAME PURCHASING SURPLUS PRODUCT --

02:29:15.780 --> 02:29:17.715
THERE AGAIN WE EXPECT THAT'S

02:29:17.782 --> 02:29:19.050
GOING TO LARGELY GO TO THE

02:29:19.116 --> 02:29:21.018
MIDWEST BUT THERE IS A BIT OF A

02:29:21.085 --> 02:29:23.120
RECOGNITION IN THIS PROGRAM THAT

02:29:23.187 --> 02:29:24.722
WE HAVE ADDITIONAL CROPS IN

02:29:24.789 --> 02:29:25.690
CALIFORNIA AND PRODUCERS IN

02:29:25.756 --> 02:29:27.325
CALIFORNIA WATER OF ACCESS TO

02:29:27.391 --> 02:29:28.893
THOSE FUNDS.

02:29:28.959 --> 02:29:30.328
AS THEY EXPANDED IT BEYOND --

02:29:30.394 --> 02:29:32.229
ALMOST TO INCLUDE PISTACHIOS

02:29:32.296 --> 02:29:33.397
CHERRIES ARE INVOLVED.

02:29:33.464 --> 02:29:36.334
I AND SOME OTHER SOME OTHER --

02:29:36.400 --> 02:29:37.868
BERMAN CROPS AS WELL SUCH AS

02:29:37.935 --> 02:29:39.437
TABLE GRAPES. ONE OF THE

02:29:39.503 --> 02:29:41.972
CHALLENGES THERE IS OF COURSE --

02:29:42.039 --> 02:29:42.973
THAT.

02:29:43.040 --> 02:29:44.342
IN THE FRESH PRODUCE SECTOR IN

02:29:44.408 --> 02:29:45.509
THE UNITED STATES WE'VE NEVER

02:29:45.576 --> 02:29:47.211
HAD DIRECT PAYMENTS SUBSIDIES

02:29:47.278 --> 02:29:48.612
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE

02:29:48.679 --> 02:29:50.548
NEVER WANTED THEM. FOR VARIOUS

02:29:50.614 --> 02:29:51.615
REASONS WILL SEE HAVING TO DO

02:29:51.682 --> 02:29:52.950
WITH THE STIFLING EFFECT THAT

02:29:53.017 --> 02:29:55.086
SUBSIDIES HAVE ON INNOVATION ON

02:29:55.152 --> 02:29:57.521
COMPETITION MARKET SIGNALS THAT --

02:29:57.588 --> 02:29:59.357
MY MEMBERS APPRECIATE MORE THAN

02:29:59.423 --> 02:30:00.725
THEY DO SUBSIDIES.

02:30:00.791 --> 02:30:02.860
AND AS DOCTOR SUMMER NOTED THE

02:30:02.927 --> 02:30:04.662
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT JUST ISN'T --

02:30:04.729 --> 02:30:06.530
CONSTRUCTED ISN'T BUILT TO MOVE

02:30:06.597 --> 02:30:08.299
DIRECT PAYMENTS TO FRESH PRODUCE

02:30:08.366 --> 02:30:09.233
GROWERS.

02:30:09.300 --> 02:30:11.302
IN AN EFFICIENT WAY SO WE DON'T

02:30:11.369 --> 02:30:12.970
KNOW HOW WELL THIS IS GOING TO

02:30:13.037 --> 02:30:14.538
ROLL OUT WE DO KNOW THAT --

02:30:14.605 --> 02:30:15.940
FARMERS IN THE MIDWEST TO ARE

02:30:16.006 --> 02:30:18.309
USED -- TO AND HAVE THAT

02:30:18.376 --> 02:30:19.577
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE USDA.

02:30:19.643 --> 02:30:20.444
ARE GOING TO BE ACCESSING THE

02:30:20.511 --> 02:30:21.746
PROGRAM QUICKLY SO WE'RE TRYING

02:30:21.812 --> 02:30:23.714
TO HUSTLE -- THROUGH THE PROCESS

02:30:23.781 --> 02:30:25.015
TO MAKE SURE MEMBERS ARE IN

02:30:25.082 --> 02:30:26.517
POSITION TO BE ABLE.

02:30:26.584 --> 02:30:28.185
TO PUT IN A CLAIM FOR AS MUCH AS

02:30:28.252 --> 02:30:29.520
THEY CAN OFFSET.

02:30:29.587 --> 02:30:32.022
SOME OF THEIR LOST THEIR LOST

02:30:32.089 --> 02:30:32.623
MARKET [inaudible]

02:30:32.690 --> 02:30:35.393
BUT WHAT WAS -- REALLY

02:30:35.459 --> 02:30:37.895
CRITICALLY STATED EARLIER IS

02:30:37.962 --> 02:30:39.363
THAT WE DON'T WANT.

02:30:39.430 --> 02:30:40.831
THOSE DIRECT PAYMENTS WE NEED

02:30:40.898 --> 02:30:43.567
THIS TO END WE NEED TO GET BACK

02:30:43.634 --> 02:30:45.569
TO WHAT WE DO BEST WHICH IS

02:30:45.636 --> 02:30:46.470
PRODUCING THE BEST PRODUCTS IN

02:30:46.537 --> 02:30:47.371
THE WORLD.

02:30:47.438 --> 02:30:49.507
AND MARKETING THEM ACROSS THE

02:30:49.573 --> 02:30:51.308
WORLD TO PEOPLE WHO WHO WANT THE

02:30:51.375 --> 02:30:52.109
MEN OF SHOWN THAT.

02:30:52.176 --> 02:30:53.944
IN THEIR IN THEIR PURCHASING

02:30:54.011 --> 02:30:57.748
DECISIONS -- REALLY CRITICAL

02:30:57.815 --> 02:30:59.550
POINT FOR THE OUTCOME HERE YET

02:30:59.617 --> 02:31:02.186
AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT -- HOW WE

02:31:02.253 --> 02:31:04.388
GET TO AN OUTCOME WHETHER IT'S

02:31:04.455 --> 02:31:05.489
IT'S ONE SIDED THERE BLINKING IN

02:31:05.556 --> 02:31:07.024
THIS TERRIBLE GAME OF CHICKEN OR

02:31:07.091 --> 02:31:10.227
WE GO BACK TO A WTO TYPE PROCESS?

02:31:10.294 --> 02:31:12.730
ABOVE MY PAY GRADE BUT ONE VERY

02:31:12.797 --> 02:31:13.864
IMPORTANT POINT WE ONE OF HIS

02:31:13.931 --> 02:31:15.633
EYES IS THAT WHEN THIS IS

02:31:15.699 --> 02:31:18.669
RESOLVED. FOR THE PRODUCE SECTOR.

02:31:18.736 --> 02:31:20.371
IN CALIFORNIA IN THE WEST

02:31:20.438 --> 02:31:21.872
PARTICULARLY WE CAN'T JUST

02:31:21.939 --> 02:31:24.508
RETURN THE STATUS QUO ANTE.

02:31:24.575 --> 02:31:25.743
WE HAD SUFFERED HAVE SUFFERED

02:31:25.810 --> 02:31:27.645
FOR YEARS DESPITE SOME SUCCESS

02:31:27.711 --> 02:31:28.245
WITH.

02:31:28.312 --> 02:31:29.947
ALMONDS AND PISTACHIOS OTHER

02:31:30.014 --> 02:31:31.816
PRODUCTS WINE CERTAINLY MOVING

02:31:31.882 --> 02:31:33.150
INTO CHINA FRESH PRODUCE

02:31:33.217 --> 02:31:35.252
COMMODITIES HAVE BEEN HIT WITH

02:31:35.319 --> 02:31:37.087
NON TARIFF BARRIERS.

02:31:37.154 --> 02:31:38.322
AROUND THE WORLD IN CHINA HAS

02:31:38.389 --> 02:31:39.890
BEEN NO EXCEPTION --

02:31:39.957 --> 02:31:42.660
PARTICULARLY -- ALLEGED --

02:31:42.726 --> 02:31:45.162
THREATS THAT OUR PRODUCTS COMING

02:31:45.229 --> 02:31:46.130
IN OUR FRESH PRODUCTS COMING TO

02:31:46.197 --> 02:31:47.932
CHINA CONTAIN A BUG OR A DISEASE.

02:31:47.998 --> 02:31:49.366
THAT THEN GIVE THEM

02:31:49.433 --> 02:31:50.801
JUSTIFICATION UNDER WTO RULES

02:31:50.868 --> 02:31:51.969
RULES TO THROW UP THE WALLS AND

02:31:52.036 --> 02:31:53.571
KEEP OUR PRODUCT OUT AND PROTECT

02:31:53.637 --> 02:31:55.539
THEIR DOMESTIC PRODUCERS -- IN

02:31:55.606 --> 02:31:57.208
AN UNFAIR MANNER WE CHALLENGES

02:31:57.274 --> 02:31:58.943
ALL THE TIME IS AN INDUSTRY BUT

02:31:59.009 --> 02:32:01.178
CHINA HAS NOT BEEN RESPONSIVE TO

02:32:01.245 --> 02:32:02.146
THE NORMAL.

02:32:02.213 --> 02:32:04.715
A GIVE AND TAKE IN IN IN THE WTO

02:32:04.782 --> 02:32:05.483
PROCESS OF RESOLVING THIS

02:32:05.549 --> 02:32:06.650
LAUNCHER CARE OF TRADE BARRIERS

02:32:06.717 --> 02:32:07.985
AND SO WE NEED STRONGER

02:32:08.052 --> 02:32:09.053
PROTECTIONS.

02:32:09.119 --> 02:32:10.588
AROUND SANITARY AND

02:32:10.654 --> 02:32:13.224
PHYTOSANITARY NON TARIFF TRADE

02:32:13.290 --> 02:32:15.526
BARRIERS THAT HAVE BEEN -- USED

02:32:15.593 --> 02:32:18.329
TO KEEP AMERICAN PRODUCT OUT OF

02:32:18.395 --> 02:32:19.964
A CHINA IN THE PAST AND BY THE

02:32:20.030 --> 02:32:21.198
WAY THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS

02:32:21.265 --> 02:32:23.501
WE CALLED FOR IN THE IN THE

02:32:27.705 --> 02:32:29.039
IMPROVEMENTS IN THE SANITARY AND

02:32:29.106 --> 02:32:29.974
PHYTOSANITARY.

02:32:30.040 --> 02:32:31.375
PROTOCOLS THERE SO -- REALLY

02:32:31.442 --> 02:32:32.643
REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T

02:32:32.710 --> 02:32:37.181
JUST GO BACK TO STATUS QUO ANTE.

02:32:37.248 --> 02:32:38.048
ONE OTHER POINT TO MAKE AND THEN

02:32:38.115 --> 02:32:39.183
AND AND THEN ALL ALL STOP IS

02:32:39.250 --> 02:32:44.021
THAT -- AS OTHERS HAVE SAID

02:32:44.088 --> 02:32:45.222
EARLIER.

02:32:45.289 --> 02:32:47.124
THE DANGER HERE IS THAT OTHERS

02:32:47.191 --> 02:32:48.459
ARE SEEKING TO REPLACE OUR

02:32:48.526 --> 02:32:49.426
MARKETS.

02:32:49.493 --> 02:32:50.728
I MENTION AUSTRALIAN ALMOND

02:32:50.794 --> 02:32:52.229
PRODUCERS WHO ARE NOW.

02:32:52.296 --> 02:32:54.031
UPPING THEIR THEIR EXPORTS TO

02:32:54.098 --> 02:32:56.400
CHINA IT'S NOT LIMITED TO THEM.

02:32:56.467 --> 02:32:57.735
IT'S EVERY COMMODITY THAT WE

02:32:57.801 --> 02:32:59.537
CURRENTLY -- ARE ABLE TO PUT

02:32:59.603 --> 02:33:00.838
INTO THE CHINESE MARKET PLACE

02:33:00.905 --> 02:33:01.472
AND IT'S COMING FROM AROUND THE

02:33:01.539 --> 02:33:03.140
WORLD.

02:33:03.207 --> 02:33:05.175
IN THIS DEBATE IT WITHIN THE AG

02:33:05.242 --> 02:33:06.610
INDUSTRY AND IT'S PROJECTION OF

02:33:06.677 --> 02:33:08.145
OF OF PRIORITIES TO THE

02:33:08.212 --> 02:33:09.446
ADMINISTRATION IT'S REALLY THE

02:33:09.513 --> 02:33:10.714
MIDWESTERN FARMERS ARE DRIVING

02:33:10.781 --> 02:33:12.182
THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE MORE EASILY

02:33:12.249 --> 02:33:13.250
REPLACEABLE IF YOU THINK ABOUT

02:33:13.317 --> 02:33:15.519
IT SOYBEANS CORN WHEAT CAN BE

02:33:15.586 --> 02:33:16.153
PRODUCED A LOT OF PLACES IN THE

02:33:16.220 --> 02:33:16.954
WORLD.

02:33:17.021 --> 02:33:18.822
ALMONDS PISTACHIOS FAR FEWER

02:33:18.889 --> 02:33:20.190
PLACES IN THE WORLD.

02:33:20.257 --> 02:33:21.926
BUT THE POINT I MADE EARLIER

02:33:21.992 --> 02:33:24.028
APPLIES EVEN MORE.

02:33:24.094 --> 02:33:25.696
EVERY GROWING CALIFORNIA --

02:33:25.763 --> 02:33:28.232
STRAWBERRIES SALARY -- FIND RAM

02:33:28.299 --> 02:33:30.901
TOMATOES BROCCOLI GO DOWN A LIST --

02:33:30.968 --> 02:33:33.404
BERRIES THEY ALL WANT TO BE ABLE

02:33:33.470 --> 02:33:34.271
TO EXPORT AND THEY ALL THINK

02:33:34.338 --> 02:33:36.407
THEY CAN AND THEY PROBABLY CAN'T

02:33:36.473 --> 02:33:37.675
GIVEN A FAIR SHOT.

02:33:37.741 --> 02:33:40.144
AND SO WE CAN'T ALLOW.

02:33:40.210 --> 02:33:41.545
AS THIS IS RESOLVED THE

02:33:41.612 --> 02:33:44.281
MIDWESTERN CROP PRODUCERS TO

02:33:44.348 --> 02:33:46.450
DOMINATE THE OUTCOME TO SET THE

02:33:46.517 --> 02:33:48.485
PROTOCOLS GOING FORWARD FOR WHAT

02:33:48.552 --> 02:33:49.820
THIS NEW TRADE RELATIONSHIP

02:33:49.887 --> 02:33:51.622
LOOKS LIKE HOWEVER WE GET OVER

02:33:51.689 --> 02:33:53.190
THAT FINISH LINE THERE HAS TO BE.

02:33:53.257 --> 02:33:55.926
A PRODUCE SECTOR AND A WEST

02:33:55.993 --> 02:33:56.293
COAST.

02:33:56.360 --> 02:34:00.064
IMPRINT ON THE RESOLUTION OF

02:34:00.130 --> 02:34:01.832
THIS DISPUTE OR THIS WAR --

02:34:01.899 --> 02:34:03.434
FINALLY I CAN'T EMPHASIZE THIS

02:34:03.500 --> 02:34:04.835
ENOUGH.

02:34:04.902 --> 02:34:06.437
OTHERS HAVE SAID IT QUITE WELL A

02:34:06.503 --> 02:34:07.538
WE CAN'T.

02:34:07.605 --> 02:34:09.440
WE CAN'T TOLERATE THIS THAT MUCH

02:34:09.506 --> 02:34:12.343
LONGER -- OUR PRESIDENT WESTERN

02:34:12.409 --> 02:34:13.377
GROWERS AMBASSADOR TOM MASSIVE

02:34:13.444 --> 02:34:15.346
WROTE -- QUITE PLAINLY SOMETIME

02:34:15.412 --> 02:34:16.046
AGO.

02:34:16.113 --> 02:34:17.281
THAT WHILE WE UNDERSTAND THE

02:34:17.348 --> 02:34:19.617
GOAL TO FORGE NEW AND FAIR TRADE

02:34:19.683 --> 02:34:20.985
AGREEMENTS PARTICULARLY WITH

02:34:21.051 --> 02:34:21.785
CHINA.

02:34:21.852 --> 02:34:23.087
THOSE AGREEMENTS WILL ONLY

02:34:23.153 --> 02:34:24.688
BENEFIT AMERICAN FARMERS IF THEY

02:34:24.755 --> 02:34:25.789
HAVEN'T PERMALINK LOST THEIR

02:34:25.856 --> 02:34:27.057
RELATIONSHIPS WITH FOREIGN

02:34:27.124 --> 02:34:29.059
BUYERS AND THAT IS HAPPENING NOW

02:34:29.126 --> 02:34:30.628
IN ANY ROAD IN OTHER WORDS WE

02:34:30.694 --> 02:34:32.963
NEED THIS ADMINISTRATION DRIVE

02:34:33.030 --> 02:34:33.631
THIS PROCESS TO CONCLUSION

02:34:33.697 --> 02:34:35.232
QUICKLY.

02:34:35.299 --> 02:34:36.567
GRAB QUICKLY UNDERLINED SIX

02:34:36.634 --> 02:34:38.168
TIMES WERE WERE WERE RUNNING OUT

02:34:38.235 --> 02:34:39.937
OF TIME FOR FOR MANY OF OUR

02:34:40.004 --> 02:34:42.272
PRODUCERS I'M AFRAID.

02:34:42.339 --> 02:34:45.075
BOB WANNA MAKE MISTER CHAIRMAN --

02:34:45.142 --> 02:34:45.976
CHAIRMAN EGGMAN MADE THIS POINT

02:34:46.043 --> 02:34:47.177
ANOTHER WAY CALIFORNIA'S BEEN

02:34:47.244 --> 02:34:48.178
BLESSED TO HAVE AS I SAID

02:34:48.245 --> 02:34:49.346
EARLIER THIS DIVERSITY OF

02:34:49.413 --> 02:34:51.315
FARMERS OF ALL SIZES PRODUCING

02:34:51.382 --> 02:34:52.282
OVER THREE HUNDRED DIFFERENT

02:34:52.349 --> 02:34:53.250
PRODUCTS.

02:34:53.317 --> 02:34:54.885
BUT WE'VE SEEN A MOVEMENT TO

02:34:54.952 --> 02:34:56.620
CONSOLIDATION WE'VE SEEN THE

02:34:56.687 --> 02:34:58.589
LARGER PLAYERS WHO CAN WITHSTAND

02:34:58.656 --> 02:35:00.057
HIGHER COSTS OF PRODUCTION THAT

02:35:00.124 --> 02:35:02.126
ARE UNIQUE TO CALIFORNIA.

02:35:02.192 --> 02:35:03.761
ABSORB THOSE SMALLER FARMS --

02:35:03.827 --> 02:35:06.597
CALIFORNIA ALREADY REQUIRES

02:35:06.664 --> 02:35:08.699
HIGHER PRODUCTION COSTS TO KEEP

02:35:08.766 --> 02:35:09.867
A CAL POLY SANDERS OBISPO STAY

02:35:09.933 --> 02:35:11.935
RECENTLY SHOWED THAT FOR A

02:35:12.002 --> 02:35:13.037
LETTUCE PRODUCER IN SALINAS --

02:35:13.103 --> 02:35:14.371
IN TWO THOUSAND SIX REGULATORY

02:35:14.438 --> 02:35:15.873
COSTS WERE A HUNDRED NINE

02:35:15.939 --> 02:35:18.575
DOLLARS PER ACRE TWO THOUSAND

02:35:18.642 --> 02:35:24.048
SEVENTEEN NOW 900-77 DOLLARS PER

02:35:24.114 --> 02:35:25.149
ACRE.

02:35:25.215 --> 02:35:26.717
YOU LOAD THAT ON TOP OF THE

02:35:26.784 --> 02:35:28.085
IMPACTS WE NOW HAVE A FROM THE

02:35:28.152 --> 02:35:28.719
TERROR FOR AND YOUR I'M AFRAID

02:35:28.786 --> 02:35:29.186
WE'RE GONNA SEE MORE

02:35:29.253 --> 02:35:29.553
CONSOLIDATION.

02:35:29.620 --> 02:35:31.121
MORE LOSS OF SMALL FARMERS WHO

02:35:31.188 --> 02:35:32.823
CAN'T -- STRETCH THEIR THEIR

02:35:32.890 --> 02:35:34.491
THEIR FINANCING CAPABILITIES

02:35:34.558 --> 02:35:35.959
THROUGH THIS THROUGH THIS WAR.

02:35:36.026 --> 02:35:38.095
SO IF THERE IS A AN ABILITY OF

02:35:38.162 --> 02:35:40.197
THE OF THIS BODY TO LOOK AT THAT

02:35:40.264 --> 02:35:42.332
REGULATORY DISPARITIES THAT IS

02:35:42.399 --> 02:35:43.667
UNIQUE TO CALIFORNIA FARMERS.

02:35:43.734 --> 02:35:45.235
A RELATIVE TO THOSE WE COMPETE

02:35:45.302 --> 02:35:46.236
AGAINST OTHER STATES AND OTHER

02:35:46.303 --> 02:35:47.838
COUNTRIES NOW IS THE TIME

02:35:47.905 --> 02:35:49.540
BECAUSE THE THE COSTS THAT ARE

02:35:49.606 --> 02:35:50.908
NOW FLOATING ON TOP OF THOSE

02:35:50.974 --> 02:35:52.042
REGULATORY COSTS.

02:35:52.109 --> 02:35:53.510
ARE BRIAN BE UNBEARABLE FOR THE

02:35:53.577 --> 02:35:55.746
SMALLER FARMERS WERE TRYING TO

02:35:55.813 --> 02:35:57.648
TRY TO PROTECT.

WITH CHINA IS BEING USED BY A

02:36:54.271 --> 02:36:56.073
HANDFUL OF BANKS CORPORATIONS TO

UNTENABLE A TRADE DEFICIT IN THE

02:37:00.677 --> 02:37:02.246
UNITED STATES AND I THINK WE'RE

02:37:02.312 --> 02:37:04.181
GONNA AT THE CONVERSATION ABOUT

02:37:04.248 --> 02:37:08.252
THE IMPACT OF OF OF THE CHINESE

02:37:08.318 --> 02:37:09.453
HERE THE TERRACE ON CHINA -- HAS

02:37:09.520 --> 02:37:10.954
TO BE LOOK MORE BROADLY AT IN

02:37:11.021 --> 02:37:14.024
CONSIDERING THE THE THE THE

02:37:14.091 --> 02:37:14.992
GROWING GET CHINA THAT ARE

02:37:15.058 --> 02:37:16.960
GROWING TRADE DEFICIT.

02:37:17.027 --> 02:37:19.429
WITH CHINA AS WILL -- THE GROWTH

02:37:19.496 --> 02:37:20.264
OF THE US TRADE DEFICIT WITH

02:37:20.330 --> 02:37:23.367
CHINA -- HAS INCREASED BY WELL

02:37:23.433 --> 02:37:24.835
OVER A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS --

02:37:24.902 --> 02:37:27.137
SINCE THE GREAT RECESSION --

02:37:27.204 --> 02:37:29.006
PLAYING A LARGE ROLE IN MY

02:37:29.072 --> 02:37:30.674
MANUFACTURING EMPLOYMENT HASN'T

OF THE ECONOMY OVER THAT TIME

02:37:34.678 --> 02:37:36.380
FRAME -- THE GROWING TRADE

02:37:36.446 --> 02:37:39.082
DEFICIT HAS -- RESULT IN JOB

02:37:39.149 --> 02:37:41.051
LOSSES IN EVERY STATE IN THE

HARDEST HIT STATES -- WHEN

02:37:56.767 --> 02:37:57.334
LOOKING AT JOB LOSSES THE SHARE

02:37:57.401 --> 02:37:58.168
OF TOTAL STATE EMPLOYMENT

02:37:58.235 --> 02:38:00.771
CALIFORNIA'S THIRD -- AND OF THE

JOB ALL OF THE TOTAL JOB LOSS

02:38:03.473 --> 02:38:04.541
CALIFORNIA IS THE FIRST TO WITH

02:38:04.608 --> 02:38:06.009
ABOUT -- FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY

02:38:06.076 --> 02:38:08.445
TWO THOUSAND JOBS LOST SINCE --

02:38:08.512 --> 02:38:09.012
TWO THOUSAND ONE IN ORDER TO

02:38:09.079 --> 02:38:09.646
START FIXING -- THE STATE WAGE

02:38:09.713 --> 02:38:10.814
GROWTH AND JOB LOSSES CREATED OR

02:38:10.881 --> 02:38:12.349
THAT'S BEEN THE CALLS BY THIS --

02:38:12.416 --> 02:38:13.951
GROWING DEFICIT ANY TRADE TALKS

02:38:14.017 --> 02:38:15.853
IN CHINA -- SHOULD INCLUDE TWO

02:38:15.919 --> 02:38:17.087
PRINCIPLES AND ONE OF THOSE IS

02:38:17.154 --> 02:38:18.388
THAT IT IS CONCLUDE A

02:38:18.455 --> 02:38:20.324
MULTILATERAL APPROACH -- THEIR

02:38:20.390 --> 02:38:21.258
STRENGTH IS OUR ALLIES TO

02:38:21.325 --> 02:38:23.160
MAXIMIZE OUR LEVERAGE -- AT THE

02:38:23.227 --> 02:38:27.030
NEGOTIATING TABLE -- AND SICK IN.

02:38:27.097 --> 02:38:28.765
WHAT THE US CAN RECOGNIZE

02:38:28.832 --> 02:38:31.068
CHINA'S RIGHT TO DEVELOP ITS

02:38:31.134 --> 02:38:32.135
ECONOMY IS A BUT?

02:38:32.202 --> 02:38:33.403
WE HAVE TO BE CLEAR THAT CHINA

02:38:33.470 --> 02:38:35.205
CAN'T BE ALLOWED TO DO SO IN A

02:38:35.272 --> 02:38:36.707
WAY THAT UNDERMINES LABOR RIGHTS

02:38:36.773 --> 02:38:38.242
AND DESABILIZE OTHER ECONOMIES

02:38:38.308 --> 02:38:40.177
THAT MEANS DRESSING LABOR AND

02:38:40.244 --> 02:38:42.913
HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS --

02:38:42.980 --> 02:38:44.615
TARIFFS ARE.

02:38:44.681 --> 02:38:47.484
ARTS EXCUSE ME ARTS AN ANGLE --

02:38:47.551 --> 02:38:48.719
BUT THEY CAN BE AN IMPORTANT

02:38:48.785 --> 02:38:50.187
TOOL TO ENTRY PRACTICES THAT

02:38:50.254 --> 02:38:52.623

WORKING AND IT WON'T -- SO LONG

02:39:05.402 --> 02:39:07.004

02:39:16.280 --> 02:39:16.747
THEY'RE SO MUCH PENT UP

02:39:16.813 --> 02:39:18.682
FRUSTRATION AMONG MANY WORKERS

PRIORITIZE THINGS LIKE LIKE GOOD

02:39:43.173 --> 02:39:43.974
TERM ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

02:39:44.041 --> 02:39:45.242

WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT POLICIES

02:39:46.910 --> 02:39:47.744
TO ENSURE THAT AMERICAN WORKERS

02:39:48.412 --> 02:39:49.413
AND SKILLS THEY NEED TO COMPETE

02:39:49.479 --> 02:39:49.980
SUCCESSFULLY IN -- BUT THE

02:39:50.047 --> 02:39:50.981
GOVERNMENT ALSO NEEDS TO

THEM AGGRESSIVELY CONSISTENTLY

02:39:57.187 --> 02:39:59.389
BUT MOST IMPORTANT STRATEGICALLY --

02:39:59.456 --> 02:40:00.490
TO ENSURE THAT OUR TRADE

02:40:00.557 --> 02:40:01.959

WITH SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT

02:40:18.742 --> 02:40:19.543
WE MIGHT HAVE BECAUSE I THINK

02:40:19.609 --> 02:40:21.011
THAT WE'VE GOT SOME THINGS THAT

02:40:21.078 --> 02:40:22.112

YOU'RE INDUSTRY GROUPS STOOD ON

02:40:28.952 --> 02:40:30.721
THE TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP BUT

02:40:30.787 --> 02:40:31.788
T. P. P..

02:40:31.855 --> 02:40:34.224
COULD HAVE SET SOME GROUND RULES

02:40:34.291 --> 02:40:37.060
AND A FRAMEWORK FOR HOW TRADE

02:40:37.127 --> 02:40:38.829
WORKED BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES

02:40:38.895 --> 02:40:40.364
AND A GREAT DEAL OF ASIA

02:40:40.430 --> 02:40:41.531
INCLUDING CHINA.

02:40:41.598 --> 02:40:43.700
THE UNITED STATES RETREATED FROM

02:40:43.767 --> 02:40:46.069
T. P. P. ALLOWING CHINA TO

02:40:46.136 --> 02:40:48.905
DICTATE TRADE MORE AGGRESSIVELY

02:40:48.972 --> 02:40:50.273
THAN UNITED STATES DID BY

02:40:50.340 --> 02:40:51.875
CREATING A FRAMEWORK WITH OTHER

02:40:51.942 --> 02:40:52.576
COUNTRIES.

02:40:52.642 --> 02:40:54.411
LEAVING UNITED STATES OUT.

02:40:54.478 --> 02:40:58.081
AND THIS IS A NEGOTIATING TACTIC

02:40:58.148 --> 02:40:59.950
THAT IS FAVORED BY -- PRESIDENT

02:41:00.017 --> 02:41:02.052
TRUMP TO NEGOTIATE ONE ON ONE

02:41:02.119 --> 02:41:05.255
RATHER THAN -- IN PARTNERSHIP

02:41:05.322 --> 02:41:06.656
WITH OTHER COUNTRIES.

02:41:06.723 --> 02:41:08.358
DO YOU THINK TPP WOULD HAVE --

02:41:08.425 --> 02:41:10.160
HELP CALIFORNIA AND OF COURSE

02:41:10.227 --> 02:41:15.866
UNITED STATES AVOID THE CURRENT --

02:41:15.932 --> 02:41:18.301
QUAGMIRE.

02:41:18.368 --> 02:41:21.304
ANYONE WANNA GO FIRST ON THAT.

02:41:21.371 --> 02:41:23.974
ONE I'LL BE HAPPY TO SAY HERE.

02:41:24.041 --> 02:41:26.343
TPP AT THE NO LONGER BEING PUT

02:41:26.410 --> 02:41:26.810
IN T. B. PAY HAS HAD A

02:41:26.877 --> 02:41:28.045
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT FOR

02:41:28.111 --> 02:41:29.146
CALIFORNIA WINE EXPORTS SO THAT

02:41:29.212 --> 02:41:29.880
JAPAN IS THE FOURTH.

02:41:29.946 --> 02:41:31.815
LARGEST EXPORT MARKET FOR US

02:41:31.882 --> 02:41:34.818
IT'S VERY STABLE MATURE MARKET

02:41:34.885 --> 02:41:36.787
IT'S ALSO VERY HIGH VALUE.

02:41:36.853 --> 02:41:39.790
IN THAT I'M WHERE ABLE TO EXPORT

02:41:39.856 --> 02:41:41.024
WIND ALL UP AND DOWN THE PRICE

02:41:41.091 --> 02:41:42.726
SCALE SO IT'S IT'S SIGNIFICANT

02:41:42.793 --> 02:41:45.295
IMPORTANT TO US -- OF COURSE OUR

02:41:45.362 --> 02:41:47.097
LARGEST COMPETITIVE WINE REGIONS

02:41:47.164 --> 02:41:49.066
ARE TRADING ARE ERIN A FREE

02:41:49.132 --> 02:41:52.736
TRADE -- OR AS A ZERO IMPACT --

02:41:52.803 --> 02:41:54.771
RELATIONSHIP WITH JAPAN WHERE AS

02:41:54.838 --> 02:41:56.606
WE OF COURSE ARE NOT IN THAT

02:41:56.673 --> 02:41:59.776
POSITION SO -- WE'RE HOPEFUL

02:41:59.843 --> 02:42:00.911
THAT WE CAN GET BACK TO FREE

02:42:00.977 --> 02:42:02.746
TRADE AGREEMENT WITH JAPAN BUT

02:42:02.813 --> 02:42:05.482
IT ABSOLUTELY HAS HAD AN IMPACT

02:42:05.549 --> 02:42:07.050
FOR THE WINE INDUSTRY.

02:42:07.117 --> 02:42:09.986
AND I'M THAT COUPLED WITH THE

02:42:10.053 --> 02:42:11.721
CURRENT SITUATION IN CHINA HAS

02:42:11.788 --> 02:42:13.890
JUST TAKEN THAT ENTIRE REGION

02:42:13.957 --> 02:42:17.394
AND CREATED HEADWINDS THAT HAVE.

02:42:17.461 --> 02:42:19.229
SLOWED OUR DEVELOPMENT.

02:42:19.296 --> 02:42:21.498
IN THE PROCESS OF TV MISTER WHO

02:42:21.565 --> 02:42:25.001
IS CHAIRMAN I WE SUPPORT THE TPP --

02:42:25.068 --> 02:42:25.602
PREFER THAT IT WOULD HAVE HELD

02:42:25.669 --> 02:42:26.236
TOGETHER.

02:42:26.303 --> 02:42:28.105
I'M HAVING SAID THAT RELATIVE TO

02:42:28.171 --> 02:42:29.206
AGRICULTURE AT LEAST A FRESH

02:42:29.272 --> 02:42:31.575
PRODUCE SECTOR -- WE HAVE SEEN

02:42:31.641 --> 02:42:33.844
SOME POSITIVE BILATERAL

02:42:33.910 --> 02:42:35.445
AGREEMENTS EITHER THE KERR OR

02:42:35.512 --> 02:42:38.014
TAKE SHAPE THE KOREAN BILATERAL

02:42:38.081 --> 02:42:40.016
BY FOR SURE WAS HELPFUL -- WE'RE

02:42:40.083 --> 02:42:41.918
GETTING A GOOD VIBES ON THE

02:42:41.985 --> 02:42:43.120
NEGOTIATIONS WITH JAPAN WE'LL

02:42:43.186 --> 02:42:45.722
SEE -- BUT CLEARLY MORE

02:42:45.789 --> 02:42:51.561
EFFICIENT WAY TO DO THIS WOULD

02:42:51.628 --> 02:42:52.129
HAVE BEEN THIRTY BEEPING FOR

02:42:52.195 --> 02:42:53.897
THAT [inaudible]

02:42:53.964 --> 02:42:56.133
THIS YOUNG.

02:42:56.199 --> 02:42:59.102
YES THE AT FILL IT UP POSTED CPP

02:42:59.169 --> 02:43:01.138
AND I THINK IT FEELS INCLUDE --

02:43:01.204 --> 02:43:02.205
SIGNIFICANT WORK PROTECTIONS

02:43:02.272 --> 02:43:02.772
THAT THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE

02:43:02.839 --> 02:43:04.040
IMPORTANT -- PARTICULARLY WHEN

02:43:04.107 --> 02:43:07.010
YOU LOOK AT THE IMPACT OF

02:43:07.077 --> 02:43:08.745
FAILING TO DO SO AND PREVIOUS

02:43:08.812 --> 02:43:10.947
TRADE DEALS INCLUDING NAFTA AND

02:43:11.014 --> 02:43:15.318
ITS IMPACT IN THE MIDWEST -- I

02:43:15.385 --> 02:43:15.819
THINK THEY WERE STRONG

02:43:15.886 --> 02:43:17.554
HESITATION FROM -- WORKERS AND

02:43:17.621 --> 02:43:19.756
UNIONS -- TO SUPPORT ON THE

02:43:19.823 --> 02:43:21.258
MOVING FORWARD AGAIN DIDN'T HAVE

02:43:21.324 --> 02:43:23.260
A STRONG FORCE A MECHANISM FOR

02:43:23.326 --> 02:43:25.195
THE LACK OF LABOR.

02:43:25.262 --> 02:43:25.729
IN OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE

02:43:25.795 --> 02:43:31.401
GLOBALLY -- MISS MITCHELL JONAH

02:43:31.468 --> 02:43:32.536
SO MISTER YOUNG ON PERHAPS MAYBE

02:43:32.602 --> 02:43:33.136
WITH ANOTHER PRESIDENT SOME OF

02:43:33.203 --> 02:43:33.703
THE PROTECTIONS THAT YOU'RE

02:43:33.770 --> 02:43:34.337
LOOKING FOR WOULD HAVE BEEN IN

02:43:34.404 --> 02:43:36.606
PLACE THE TPP DID NOT INCLUDE AT

02:43:36.673 --> 02:43:38.742
THE TIME -- DO YOU SEE THAT

02:43:38.808 --> 02:43:41.311
PLAYING OUT IN THE THE UNIT DODD.

02:43:41.378 --> 02:43:43.146
BILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS THAT ARE

02:43:43.213 --> 02:43:45.215
TAKING PLACE WITH COUNTRIES.

02:43:45.282 --> 02:43:47.551
ORDER NOW THEY'RE NOT PART OF

02:43:47.617 --> 02:43:48.251
THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE IT

02:43:48.318 --> 02:43:50.253
PRESIDENT IS NOT.

02:43:50.320 --> 02:43:53.523
AS FOCUSED OR OR PERHAPS HE IS.

02:43:53.590 --> 02:43:54.391
DO YOU MEAN THE BILATERAL

02:43:54.457 --> 02:43:55.058
CONVERSATIONS WITH WHAT'S RIGHT.

02:43:55.125 --> 02:43:56.459
ALL THE OTHER COUNTRIES YOU KNOW

02:43:56.526 --> 02:43:58.295
THE ONE ON ONE CONVERSATIONS.

02:43:58.361 --> 02:43:59.696
OUR OUR LABOR CONCERNS THAT WERE

02:43:59.763 --> 02:44:01.731
WERE VALID ON ON TPP CRITICISM

02:44:01.798 --> 02:44:03.867
YOU KNOW BEING PRESENT IN THOSE

02:44:03.934 --> 02:44:05.101
NEGOTIATIONS.

02:44:05.168 --> 02:44:08.238
I MEAN WE HOPEFULLY IN THE NEXT

02:44:08.305 --> 02:44:09.472
ADMINISTRATION THAT THAT WOULD

02:44:09.539 --> 02:44:11.441
BE THE CASE I I I DON'T THINK.

02:44:11.508 --> 02:44:14.077
OUR CONCERNS WHO ARE BEING

02:44:14.144 --> 02:44:14.511
CARRIED OUT IN THOSE

02:44:14.578 --> 02:44:15.345
CONVERSATIONS.

02:44:15.412 --> 02:44:17.447
AGAIN I I THINK WE HAVE A VERY --

02:44:17.514 --> 02:44:18.815
DEMOCRATIC PRICES MOVING FORWARD

02:44:18.882 --> 02:44:20.984
AND I THINK -- WORKERS MORE AND

02:44:21.051 --> 02:44:22.686
MORE ARE UNDERSTANDING THE

02:44:22.752 --> 02:44:24.187
IMPACT OF THESE TRADE AGREEMENTS

02:44:24.254 --> 02:44:27.657
ON THEIR ABILITY TO WORK RIGHT

02:44:27.724 --> 02:44:33.196
SO -- YEAH I I WANNA STREET TO

02:44:33.263 --> 02:44:34.431
FAR AWAY FROM THAT A BILLS

02:44:34.497 --> 02:44:37.367
POSITION ON THIS BUT I I I THINK --

02:44:37.434 --> 02:44:40.003
AGAIN I THINK THE THE THE FOCUS

02:44:40.070 --> 02:44:41.771
BEING ON SOME OF FORCE A

02:44:41.838 --> 02:44:44.107
MECHANISM -- TO WORKER

02:44:44.174 --> 02:44:45.809
PROTECTIONS AND A BEER APPROACH

02:44:45.875 --> 02:44:47.544
TO HOW -- TRADE IS GOING TO BE

02:44:47.611 --> 02:44:48.745
APPROACH INSTEAD OF JUST LOOKING

02:44:48.812 --> 02:44:50.146
AT IT AS A FREE AND COST

02:44:50.213 --> 02:44:52.048
APPROACH IT IS PROBABLY BEST IT

02:44:52.115 --> 02:44:52.949
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TERRORISTS

02:44:53.016 --> 02:44:54.517
THAT HAVE BEEN IMPOSED BY THE

02:44:54.584 --> 02:44:55.619
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND THEN OF

02:44:55.685 --> 02:44:57.320
COURSE THE THE RETALIATORY

02:44:57.387 --> 02:44:59.756
TERRORIST DO YOU BELIEVE THAT.

02:44:59.823 --> 02:45:01.725
SOME OF THIS ACTIVITY ON THE

02:45:01.791 --> 02:45:02.926
UNITED STATES PART WILL LEAD TO

02:45:02.993 --> 02:45:04.794
MORE JOB GROWTH IN CREATION IN

02:45:04.861 --> 02:45:08.598
THE UNITED STATES -- THAT WOULD

02:45:08.665 --> 02:45:10.667
BE YOU KNOW PERHAPS -- DESPITE

02:45:10.734 --> 02:45:12.335
THE RETALIATORY -- NATURE

02:45:12.402 --> 02:45:13.536
BECAUSE MANY SECTION MAY LEAVE

02:45:13.603 --> 02:45:15.705
CHINA MAY CREATE JOBS HERE IN

02:45:15.772 --> 02:45:17.874
UNITED STATES.

02:45:17.941 --> 02:45:19.342
I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW AND I

02:45:19.409 --> 02:45:20.677
DON'T I THINK IT'S PROBABLY TOO

02:45:20.744 --> 02:45:24.614
EARLY TO SAY I THINK -- I THINK

02:45:24.681 --> 02:45:27.083
THE TRUMPS -- APPROACH TO THE

02:45:27.150 --> 02:45:28.251
THE TEARS CHINA JUST DOESN'T

02:45:28.318 --> 02:45:30.020
AGAIN SEEM TO HAVE ANY SORT OF

02:45:30.086 --> 02:45:31.488
STRATEGY -- GOAL WHICH CAN BE

02:45:31.554 --> 02:45:35.625
HARMFUL TO WORKERS HERE -- SO I

02:45:35.692 --> 02:45:36.726
THINK THE I THINK THERE IS A

02:45:36.793 --> 02:45:38.561
UNIVERSAL GOAL OF HAVING THESE

02:45:38.628 --> 02:45:41.398
ISSUES RESOLVED -- QUICKLY BUT I

02:45:41.464 --> 02:45:44.301
THINK MORE BROADLY -- OUTSIDE OF

02:45:44.367 --> 02:45:46.036
THE CAN GET THE SPECIFIC TERRACE

02:45:46.102 --> 02:45:47.337
AGAINST CHINA I THINK LABOR

02:45:47.404 --> 02:45:48.238
MOVEMENT HAS SUPPORTED

02:45:48.305 --> 02:45:50.740
TERRORISTS THAT OUR STRATEGIC IN

02:45:50.807 --> 02:45:51.408
YOUR OWN SCOPE.

02:45:51.474 --> 02:45:53.376
AT THAT ARE CONNECTED TO A

02:45:53.443 --> 02:45:55.178
STRATEGIC GOAL AND LACKING THAT

02:45:55.245 --> 02:45:58.181
HERE -- CREATE SOME HARMFUL

02:45:58.248 --> 02:46:00.283
TRICKLE DOWN EFFECT STAY AT THE

02:46:00.350 --> 02:46:02.886
BUSINESSES BUT ALSO IN FACT --

02:46:02.952 --> 02:46:03.987
WORKERS -- WAGES BUT ALSO THEIR

02:46:04.054 --> 02:46:07.057
ABILITY -- TO BY SOME PRODUCTS

02:46:07.123 --> 02:46:08.625
YEAH I THINK YOU MISTER YOUNG.

02:46:08.692 --> 02:46:10.527
MISTER COULD YOU TALKABOUT THE

02:46:10.593 --> 02:46:11.494
SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN

02:46:11.561 --> 02:46:12.729
SUBSIDIES.

02:46:12.796 --> 02:46:13.997
WE WE'VE HEARD THAT PICKED A

02:46:14.064 --> 02:46:15.265
CRITICISM FROM CALIFORNIA'S

02:46:15.332 --> 02:46:16.333
PERSPECTIVE A LOT OF THAT WILL

02:46:16.399 --> 02:46:17.467
GO TO THE MIDWEST HOW MUCH DO

02:46:17.534 --> 02:46:22.872
YOU THINK WILL MAKE IT TO THE

02:46:22.939 --> 02:46:24.441
CALIFORNIA MARKET.

02:46:24.507 --> 02:46:25.909
IT'S A GREAT QUESTION -- I DON'T

02:46:25.975 --> 02:46:26.876
KNOW A LOT OF THIS DEPENDS ON

02:46:26.943 --> 02:46:28.611
HOW MANY OF OUR FARMERS GO

02:46:28.678 --> 02:46:30.046
THROUGH THE PROCESS OF

02:46:30.113 --> 02:46:32.515
APPLICATION AND GET TIMELY

02:46:32.582 --> 02:46:34.117
RESPONSE FROM USDA AGAIN THE

02:46:34.184 --> 02:46:35.418
MECHANISMS AREN'T REALLY THERE

02:46:35.485 --> 02:46:37.187
WERE CREATING THEM ON THE FLY.

02:46:37.253 --> 02:46:39.022
I WILL SAY THE SECOND PROGRAM

02:46:39.089 --> 02:46:39.856
SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM

02:46:39.923 --> 02:46:41.791
MADE ONE CRITICAL PROVEN THAT

02:46:41.858 --> 02:46:43.226
OVER THE FIRST.

02:46:43.293 --> 02:46:44.260
ONE THE FIRST ONE HAD AN

02:46:44.327 --> 02:46:46.463
ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME THRESHOLD

02:46:46.529 --> 02:46:47.764
OF I BELIEVE IT'S NINE OR

02:46:47.831 --> 02:46:48.998
THOUSAND DOLLARS ABOVE WHICH YOU

02:46:49.065 --> 02:46:50.800
COULD NOT APPLY FOR CALIFORNIA

02:46:50.867 --> 02:46:53.269
WE HAVE -- PHARMACISTS AGI TENDS

02:46:53.336 --> 02:46:54.604
TO BE THERE OR MAYBE A LITTLE

02:46:54.671 --> 02:46:55.772
HIGHER BECAUSE WE HAVE LARGER

02:46:55.839 --> 02:46:57.774
OPERATIONS IN MULTIPLE PARTS OF

02:46:57.841 --> 02:46:58.608
THE STATE.

02:46:58.675 --> 02:47:00.110
SO THEY DID AWAY WITH THAT AGI

02:47:00.176 --> 02:47:03.947
THRESHOLD THAT SHOULD HELP US

02:47:04.013 --> 02:47:04.514
BUT I CAN'T GIVE YOU A GOOD

02:47:04.581 --> 02:47:05.382
ESTIMATE.

02:47:05.448 --> 02:47:06.783
THEY BY THE WAY ON THAT SIXTEEN

02:47:06.850 --> 02:47:07.984
BILLION THE ADMINISTRATION TENDS

02:47:08.051 --> 02:47:08.518
TO ROLL THAT OUT IN THREE

02:47:08.585 --> 02:47:09.919
TRANCHES.

02:47:09.986 --> 02:47:10.920
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT COME

02:47:10.987 --> 02:47:14.190
MAYBE INTO TRASHES OR OR -- ONE

02:47:14.257 --> 02:47:15.892
NOT STRETCH IT OUT.

02:47:15.959 --> 02:47:16.559

LEGISLATURE DO IT COME THE

02:49:02.966 --> 02:49:05.068
MINISTRATION DO -- AND SOME OF

02:49:05.134 --> 02:49:06.035

02:49:06.102 --> 02:49:09.472
HIGHLIGHT SO TRY TO BE QUICK --

02:49:09.539 --> 02:49:10.473
AND I JUST WANNA DO SOME

02:49:10.540 --> 02:49:12.408
HIGHLIGHTS HERE YOU KNOW WE WE

02:49:12.475 --> 02:49:13.877
GENERATE ABOUT A HUNDRED FOUR

02:49:13.943 --> 02:49:16.312
THOUSAND JOBS STATEWIDE 97%

02:49:16.379 --> 02:49:17.046
NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND OF THOSE

02:49:17.113 --> 02:49:18.214
IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY ESPECIALLY

02:49:18.281 --> 02:49:18.648
IN.

02:49:18.715 --> 02:49:20.350
HIGH A CHRONIC UNEMPLOYMENT

02:49:20.416 --> 02:49:22.218
AREAS SO THAT SIGNIFICANT WOULD

02:49:22.285 --> 02:49:23.253
GENERATE ABOUT TWENTY ONE

02:49:23.319 --> 02:49:24.420
BILLION IN THE ECONOMIC REVENUE

02:49:24.487 --> 02:49:26.589
DIRECTLY ELEVEN BILLION TO THE

02:49:26.656 --> 02:49:28.591
STATE'S TOTAL ECONOMY -- THIS

02:49:28.658 --> 02:49:31.394
LAST YEAR AUCTION TWENTY

02:49:31.461 --> 02:49:31.961
SEVENTEEN OUR EXPORTS WERE

02:49:32.028 --> 02:49:34.330
VALUED AT ABOUT FOUR POINT FIVE

02:49:34.397 --> 02:49:36.499
BILLION -- WHICH SUBSTANTIALLY

02:49:36.566 --> 02:49:37.967
CONTRIBUTES THE AGRICULTURAL

02:49:38.034 --> 02:49:40.770
TRADE SURPLUS -- OBVIOUSLY WERE

02:49:40.837 --> 02:49:42.205
THE TOP THREE ONE OF THE TOP

02:49:42.272 --> 02:49:44.841
THREE VALUED COMMODITIES -- IT

02:49:44.908 --> 02:49:47.510
WE WORST TARGETED IN -- TWENTY

02:49:47.577 --> 02:49:49.212
EIGHTEEN APRIL SECOND -- WITH

02:49:49.279 --> 02:49:51.714
THE TWO THIRTY TWOS AND SO IT'S

02:49:51.781 --> 02:49:52.315
JUST NOT TRYING TO FOR US BUT

02:49:52.382 --> 02:49:54.484
TURKEY BUT 25% IS NOT CHANGED

02:49:54.551 --> 02:49:55.785
AND TARGETS A SIGNIFICANT MARKET

02:49:55.852 --> 02:49:57.053
IT'S NOT OUR LARGEST BUT IT'S A

02:49:57.120 --> 02:49:59.856
SIGNIFICANT -- SO THIS PROLONGED

02:49:59.923 --> 02:50:04.694
TRADE DISPUTE IS HURT -- THE

02:50:04.761 --> 02:50:06.229
INDUSTRY.

02:50:06.296 --> 02:50:07.130
DAVID MENTIONED SOME NUMBERS I

02:50:07.196 --> 02:50:07.764
WON'T REPEAT THEM -- I DO WANT

02:50:07.830 --> 02:50:08.531
TO SAY THAT IF YOU LOOK

02:50:08.598 --> 02:50:09.599
SPECIFICALLY AT DIRECT CHINA

02:50:09.666 --> 02:50:11.034
SHIPMENTS -- WHICH WE HAVE

02:50:11.100 --> 02:50:11.801
ARGUED WITH THE U. S. T.

02:50:11.868 --> 02:50:13.336
ECONOMIST IN TERMS OF HONG KONG

02:50:13.403 --> 02:50:14.504
CHINA BUT THAT'S A WHOLE

02:50:14.571 --> 02:50:16.906
DIFFERENT DISCUSSION -- WE'RE

02:50:16.973 --> 02:50:18.841
LOOKING AT THE FIRST QUARTER OF

02:50:18.908 --> 02:50:19.842
TWENTY NINETEEN WERE ABOUT 60%

02:50:19.909 --> 02:50:21.544
OF WHAT WE SHIPPED IN THE FIRST

02:50:21.611 --> 02:50:23.646
QUARTER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO

02:50:23.713 --> 02:50:25.148
THAT'S A SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE --

02:50:25.214 --> 02:50:27.250
AS AS I'M WAS INDICATED TO

02:50:27.317 --> 02:50:30.853
MEANWHILE AUSTRALIA AS STRONG AS

02:50:30.920 --> 02:50:32.388
LOOKING OVER THAT ELEVEN MONTH.

02:50:32.455 --> 02:50:33.890
SAME TERM ABOUT INCREASE OF

02:50:33.957 --> 02:50:35.825
2000% NOW THIS IS SIGNIFICANT

02:50:35.892 --> 02:50:37.460
BECAUSE AUSTRALIA IS ACTUALLY

02:50:37.527 --> 02:50:40.129
MOVING ITS EXPORTS INTO OTHER

02:50:40.196 --> 02:50:41.431
COUNTRIES INTO CHINA.

02:50:41.497 --> 02:50:42.265
BECAUSE WHEN THEY KNOW THAT

02:50:42.332 --> 02:50:44.000
THERE IS A RESOLUTION THEY WANT

02:50:44.067 --> 02:50:45.168
TO SATURATE THAT MARKET AND WHEN

02:50:45.234 --> 02:50:46.903
THEY KNOW THAT -- OVER THE LAST

02:50:46.970 --> 02:50:48.504
TEN YEARS WE'VE INVESTED SEVENTY

02:50:48.571 --> 02:50:50.073
FOUR MILLION IN THAT MARKET IN

02:50:50.139 --> 02:50:52.575
CHINA TO OPEN AND EXPAND THAT

02:50:52.642 --> 02:50:53.876
MARKET AND THEY ARE TAKING THEM

02:50:53.943 --> 02:50:55.511
VERY GOOD ADVANTAGE OF THAT WAS

02:50:55.578 --> 02:50:58.581
0% -- TERRA FOR AS A RESULT OF

02:50:58.648 --> 02:51:00.516
THE WTO AGREEMENT -- SO IN

02:51:00.583 --> 02:51:01.918
CLOSING I WANT TO SAY THAT YOU

02:51:01.985 --> 02:51:03.519
KNOW WE'RE INTERESTED IN TRADING

02:51:03.586 --> 02:51:05.888
MARKET GROWTH WE'VE SPENT A LOT

02:51:05.955 --> 02:51:06.623
OF TIME IN DC.

02:51:06.689 --> 02:51:07.957
I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE AREAS

02:51:08.024 --> 02:51:09.525
I WANT TO FOCUS ON YOU KNOW I GO

02:51:09.592 --> 02:51:11.127
TO THESE TRADE EVENTS THESE

02:51:11.194 --> 02:51:13.029
DISCUSSIONS -- WITH THE

02:51:13.096 --> 02:51:15.331
SECRETARY WITH ADMINISTRATION

02:51:15.398 --> 02:51:18.267
AND WITH OMB AND YOU JUST SEE

02:51:18.334 --> 02:51:20.103
THE MIDWEST PRESENCE.

02:51:20.169 --> 02:51:21.704
YOU SEE CALIFORNIA'S PRESENCE IT

02:51:21.771 --> 02:51:22.372
GOES BACK TO YOU IN THE DAY WHEN

02:51:22.438 --> 02:51:23.906
I WORKED IN THE ADMINISTRATION

02:51:23.973 --> 02:51:25.108
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THREE OR FOUR

02:51:25.174 --> 02:51:28.344
LOBBYIST. FOR STATE THIS BIG.

02:51:28.411 --> 02:51:31.247
AND IT JUST INFURIATES YOU ASIDE

02:51:31.314 --> 02:51:31.848
FROM THE DAY IN THE GOOD OLD

02:51:31.914 --> 02:51:33.449
DAYS AND WE HAD TRADING COMMERCE

02:51:33.516 --> 02:51:35.451
REPS IN KEY MARKETS.

02:51:35.518 --> 02:51:37.420
AND I I WOULD HOPE THAT AS SOME

02:51:37.487 --> 02:51:39.756
DAY SOMEDAY SOON THAT WE RE

02:51:39.822 --> 02:51:41.791
EXAMINE NOT ESPECIALLY NOT JUST

02:51:41.858 --> 02:51:43.226
AN AGRICULTURE FROM SELFISH

02:51:43.292 --> 02:51:44.327
PERSPECTIVE.

02:51:44.394 --> 02:51:45.995
BUT JUST HOW MUCH THE

02:51:46.062 --> 02:51:47.296
INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY IS

02:51:47.363 --> 02:51:49.298
