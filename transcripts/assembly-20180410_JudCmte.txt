GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR GOOD MORNING. FEDERAL LAW ALLOWS A PERSON UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE TO APPLY FOR LEGAL PERMANENT RESIDENTS IF THEY ARE GRANTED SPECIAL IMMIGRATION JUVENILE STATUS IN CALIFORNIA MANY YOUTH BETWEEN THE AGES OF EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY ONE WERE UNABLE TO ACQUIRE THE FINDINGS FROM THE SUPERIOR COURT NECESSARY TO OBTAIN SPECIAL. IMMIGRANT JUVENILE STATUS THIS WAS DUE TO THE INABILITY OF THE COURT OF A PROBATE COURTS TO TAKE JURISDICTION OF INDIVIDUALS OVER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN AND ESTABLISH GUARDIANSHIP OF THAT PERSON. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AB NINE HUNDRED WAS SIGNED INTO LAW TO LEAVE EIGHT THE SITUATION BY CREATING PROBATE GUARDIANSHIP FOR UNMARRIED YOUTH BETWEEN THE AGES OF EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY ONE. AFTER ENACTMENT OF AB NINE HUNDRED HOWEVER THERE HAS BEEN CONFUSION REGARDING WHO CAN PETITION FOR GUARDIANSHIP. IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER RELATIVE OR ANY OTHER PERSON INTENDS TO INCLUDE PARENTS IN SOME CASES A PARENT IS THE ONLY RELATIVE THE INDIVIDUAL HOUSE. THIS VAGUENESS IN STATUTE WAS PER. WAS PREVENTED HAS PREVENTED CERTAIN APPLICANTS FOR SPECIAL IMMIGRANT JUVENILE STATUS FROM BEING SUBMITTED DUE TO UNCERTAINTY WHETHER GUARDIANSHIP WILL BE ESTABLISHED WITH THE PARENT AT THE PETITIONER. WHEN THE GUARDIANSHIP IS NOT ESTABLISHED USED IS NOT RECEIVE THE NECESSARY FINDINGS ULTIMATELY PREVENTED FROM APPLYING FOR THE STATUS AB TWENTY NINETY ADDRESSES THIS AMBIGUITY IN STATE LAW BY CLARIFYING THAT PARENT IS AUTHORIZED TO FILE A PETITION FOR GUARDIANSHIP. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IS CAMILLA. KAMALA ALVAREZ SORRY. MY. EYES OUR PLANE ADJUSTMENT TRICKS ON ME NOT GETTING OLD. WITH CENTRAL AMERICAN RESOURCE CENTER. GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY MY NAME IS CAMILLE ALVAREZ I AM A MANAGING ATTORNEY OF THE UNACCOMPANIED MINOR REPRESENTATION PROJECT OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN RESOURCE ARCHITECTS AND OF LOS ANGELES. I WANNA START BY THINKING ASSEMBLY WOMAN GONZALEZ. FLETCHER FOR PROPOSING AB TWENTY NINETY AT A TIME WHERE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES LIVE IN FEAR AND UNCERTAINTY IT'S CRITICAL THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA STEP IN TO DEFEND THEM. I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UNACCOMPANIED MINORS FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS BUT I HAVE WORK TO HELP IMMIGRANT FAMILIES ARE MUCH LONGER. IN WORKING WITH IMMIGRANT FAMILIES OVERWHELMING SENTIMENT FROM EVERY PERSON I'VE WORKED WITH IS THE DESIRE FOR A BETTER LIFE. PARTICULARLY IN WORKING WITH PARENTS OF IMMIGRANT CHILDREN I CAN SAY CONFIDENTLY THAT ALMOST EVERY PARENT THAT I WORK WITH MONTHS PROVIDE THEIR CHILDREN WITH A SAFE AND SECURE FUTURE. BY ENACTING AB TWENTY NINETY THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE WILL GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARENTS. AB TWENTY NINETY CLARIFIES EXISTING STATE LAW THAT ALLOWS FOR GUARDIANSHIP TO BE GRANTED TO USE WHO ARE OVER EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD BUT BELOW THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE. A. B. NIGHT TWENTY NINETY DOES NOT CHANGE EXISTING LAW AND ANYWAY IT JUST CLARIFIES THAT THE PHRASE A RELATIVE OR ANY OTHER PERSON INCLUDES PARENTS OF USE UNDER TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE. WHILE THIS CLEVER KITCHEN MAY SEEM SMALL IT WOULD PROVIDE ENORMOUS BENEFITS TO A CLASS OF USE HER IN NEED OF EXTRA SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE FROM THEIR PARENTS IN AN OFFICIAL CAPACITY. I'D LIKE TO TAKE THIS TIME TO GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES OF YOUNG THE TYPE OF YOUNG PEOPLE THAT AB TWENTY NINETY WOULD BENEFIT. THE FIRST IS A YOUNG MAN THAT I WORKED WITH FOR THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF. THIS YOUNG MAN IS TWENTY YEARS OLD AND TO THE UNITED STATES WITH HIS YOUNGER BROTHER AND SISTER IN ORDER TO FREE FROM VIOLENCE IN THEIR HOME COUNTRY OF THEM TO ADDRESS. WHEN THIS YOUNG MAN ENTERED THE COUNTRY HE WAS ONLY SIXTEEN YEARS OLD SADLY HIS MOTHER SAID AND SIBLINGS FELL PREY TO AN ATTORNEY THAT DEPLETE VIRTUALLY NOTHING FOR HIS FAMILY FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS OTHER THAN TAKE THEIR MONEY. BY THE TIME GOT US AND. INHERITED THE CASE THIS YOUNG MAN HAD ALREADY TURNED EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD AND DID NOT HAVE MANY OPTIONS FOR LEGAL RELIEF. HIS YOUNGER SIBLINGS HOWEVER WERE UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN AND HAD A VIABLE CASE FOR SPECIAL IMMIGRANT JUVENILE STATUS BASED ON THE ABANDONMENT OF THE SAME FATHER. BECAUSE THE OLDER SIBLING WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD THE FAMILY COURTS JURISDICTION DID NOT EXTEND TO HEAD THE OLDEST SIBLING AND HE DID NOT HAVE THE SAME OPTION. EVEN THOUGH ALL THREE SIBLINGS WERE ABANDONED BY THEIR FATHERS WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF BEING RETAINED WE WERE ABLE TO OBTAIN SPECIAL IMMIGRANT JUVENILE FINDINGS FOR THE YOUNGER TWO SIBLINGS HOWEVER THE OLDER SIBLINGS OUT OF LUCK ALL TUBE. ALL DUE TO THE MISS ADVICE OF ONE ATTORNEY AND HIS AGE THE CLARIFICATION MAY BE A BIT MADE BY AB TWENTY NINETY WOULD PROVIDE AN OPTION FOR A OF RELIEF TO YOU SUCH AS THIS YOUNG MAN. THIS YOUNG MAN IS INCREDIBLY BRAVE AND BRIGHT HE WANTS NOTHING MORE THAN TO REMAIN IN THE UNITED STATES OF HIS FAMILY AND WORK TOWARDS A BETTER LIFE. THIS YOUNG MAN IS SO DETERMINED TO SUCCEED IN THE UNITED STATES HE TRAVELS AROUND TWO HOURS TWICE A WEEK TO TAKE ENGLISH CLASSES AT THE CLOSEST COMMUNITY COLLEGE. WITH THE CONSENT OF THIS YOUNG MAN HIS MOTHER WOULD HAVE THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO PETITION THE PROBATE COURTS FOR LEGAL GUARDIANSHIP OVER HER SON. DESERVE RIGHT THIS YOUNG MAN WITH THE PEACE OF MIND AND SENSE OF SECURITY SECURITY THAT HE IS FINALLY SAFE AND SECURE WITH HIS MOTHER IN THE UNITED STATES. WITHOUT THE CLARIFICATION MADE BY AB TWENTY NINETY EIGHT THIS WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE. WELL AB TWENTY NINETY WOULD PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED RELIEF FOR UNACCOMPANIED WRITERS IT WOULD ALSO BENEFIT OTHER IMMIGRANT YOUTH LIVING IN CALIFORNIA. I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU ABOUT ANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN WHO WOULD GREATLY BENEFIT FROM THE BECAUSE I'M AFRAID YOU'RE ABOUT OUT OF TIME. THANK YOU. I YOU COULD WRAP UP. YEAH THAT'S RIGHT THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. JEANNE AT THIS LEVEL WITH THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SAY NOT OPPOSITION. SINGER BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTION. CUMMINS. SINGER WAS GONZALEZ FLETCHER YOU MAY CLOSE I JUST ASK OUR LIVE UP. THANK YOU. YOU HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND AND THE MOTION IS TO PASS.

AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY FOUR KILEY IN CORK AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY ONE GALLAGHER. AB THIRTY FORTY SEVEN DALY AND A. B. THIRTY ONE. TWELVE GRAYSON. RIGHT IS RACE. AB TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I WANT TO FIRST THANK THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS BILL. AB TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY SEVEN PROVIDES A MUCH NEEDED INCREASE. THE COURT REPORTERS FEE FOR TRANSCRIPTION OF RECORDS. THE USE OF COURT REPORTERS CONTINUES TO BE THE MOST EFFICIENT AND COST EFFECTIVE METHOD TO MAKE AN ACCURATE AND COMPLETE VERBATIM RECORD OF COURT PROCEEDINGS. AND ACCURATE RECORD IS ESSENTIAL TO ANY APPEAL. COURT REPORTERS ARE HIGHLY SKILLED INDIVIDUALS WERE PREDOMINANTLY WOMEN. AND GET PAID EIGHTY THREE CENTS PER PAGE A TRANSCRIPTION. THIS FEE SET BY STATUTE HAS NOT BEEN INCREASED SINCE NINETEEN NINETY. WE'RE DISCUSSING ISSUES OF THE GENDER PAY GAP AND RECOGNIZING THAT MOST COURT REPORTERS ARE WOMEN THE FEE IS A PRIME EXAMPLE OF HOW WOMEN ARE SIMPLY NOT COMPENSATED. APPROPRIATELY. AB TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY SEVEN ESTABLISHES AN INCREMENTAL PAY INCREASE TO APPROPRIATELY COMPENSATE COURT REPORTERS FOR THEIR AFTER HOURS WORK ON TRANSCRIPTS. THIS INCREMENTAL PAY INCREASE WILL TAKE THE CURRENT EIGHTY THREE CENTS AND REYES A TWO ONE DOLLAR THIRTEEN CENTS BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE. A SMALL INCREMENTAL TRANSCRIPT FEE INCREASE WILL HELP ENSURE THAT THERE IS GREATER PAY EQUITY FOR COURT REPORTERS. A PERFORMING IMPRINT IMPERATIVE JOB FOR A COURT SYSTEM. HERE TO TESTIFY WITH ME FROM THE CALIFORNIA COURT REPORTERS ASSOCIATION. CAROLYN DASHER CAROLINE DASHER WHO CURRENTLY SERVES AS A COURT REPORTER IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PUTS. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU I'M CAROLYN GUSHER AND I'M THE PRESIDENT THE CALIFORNIA COURT REPORTERS ASSOCIATION WHICH IS A STATEWIDE ENTITY WITH THE BROAD MEMBERSHIP OF OFFICIAL FREELANCE AS WELL AS CARP PROVIDERS REPORTERS. AND OUR MEMBERS ARE PLEASED TO SPONSOR THIS LEGISLATION COURT REPORTING IS AN HONORABLE PROFESSION MORE THAN NINETY PERCENT OF OUR PROFESSION ARE WOMEN. OUR MEMBERS ARE VERY PROUD OF THEIR WORK AND THE CONTRIBUTION THAT THEY GIVE TO THE JUDICIAL PROCESS. I'VE BEEN A COURT REPORTER FOR OVER THIRTY ONE YEARS IN THE LOS ANGELES COURT ROOMS AND IS THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE I PRETTY MUCH SEEN IT ALL AND THE ONE THING I HAVEN'T SEEN. IT SINCE NINETEEN NINETY HAS BEEN A TRANSCRIPT RATE INCREASE. AND THAT'S THE FEE THAT WE COLLECT FOR PREPARING AND PRODUCING OUR TRANSCRIPTS AND WHAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW IS IT OFFICIAL COURT REPORTERS ARE HYBRID EMPLOYEES. FROM NINE TO FIVE OR EIGHT TO FIVE WORD OR TYPICAL NORMAL WORKERS IN THE COURTS WERE PAID A SALARY AND BENEFITS BUT THEN WE DO OUR TRANSCRIPTS THAT'S THE EVENING AND WEEKENDS WE DO NOT RECEIVE ANY OVERTIME PAY. AND WE'RE NOT ENTITLED TO OVERTIME PAY AND WE DON'T ACCURATE. ANY BENEFITS SO INSTEAD BY STATUTE WERE DESIGNATED AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. JUST ABOUT EVERY WEEK ANY COURT REPORTER HAS TO PUT IN MANY MANY HOURS AFTER WORK AFTER HOURS AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILY IGNORING THEIR FAMILIES NOT GOING TO HOLD THE THINGS. JUST TO PREPARE THESE TRANSCRIPTS THAT ARE STATUTORILY REQUIRED. BY LAW WE HAVE TO PAY FOR OUR OWN EQUIPMENT SOFTWARE COVER ALL THE MATERIALS AND MAINTENANCE. AND WHERE TAXES INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND SO SINCE THE FEE WAS SET BY THE LEGISLATURE IN NINETEEN NINETY. IT HASN'T BEEN CHANGED. AND THE LEGISLATURE IS THE ONLY ENTITY THAT INCREASED CAN INCREASE THAT THEME. I ASK COMEY HAVE THE COURT REPORTERS IN ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT OUR TIME IS KIND THAT OUR WORK IS RESPECTED AND ASK YOU PLEASE TO SUPPORT THE FLEDGLING. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. MISTER CHAIRMAN PRESENT NOT HERNANDEZ ALSO BEHALF OF THE HEALTH RECORD PORTER ASSOCIATION. LET ME JUST LIMIT MY REMARKS TO ONE ISSUE THAT WASN'T MENTIONED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND THAT IS THE TRANSCRIPT REIMBURSEMENT FUND OF THE TRF. OF THIS IS A FIND WHICH. HELPS A INDIGENT LITIGANTS ON PAY FOR THE TRANSCRIPT. AND WE. SEE CARRIES VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT. THE FUND IS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT FUNDED. BY THE LICENSING FEES OF COURSE VOTERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT'S IT NO BUT NOT NOTHING FROM THE GENERAL FUND COMPLETELY FROM THE LICENSES. LAST YEAR IT REALLY DOES LAST YEAR CRA SUPPORTED ON EFFORT TO A AUTHORIZED THE CORPORATE BOARD TO INCREASE. THE LICENSING FEES A UP TO A DOUBLING IN MY UNDERSTANDING IS IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS. THAT DOUBLING WILL OCCUR MEETING THAT COURT REPORTERS WILL HAVE TO PAY. I BELIEVE IT'S JUNE INFIDELITY YOUR FOR THE LICENSES. THAT MONEY THEN WILL BE AVAILABLE TO GO INTO THE TRANSCRIPT REIMBURSEMENT FUND TO HELP COVER THE COST FOR INDIGENT LITIGANTS THAT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE FUN. I SEE SCARY ACTUALLY HELP SPONSOR THE INITIAL LEGISLATION TO CREATE THE FUND AND HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THERE TOO UP TO FIGHT FOR THE CONTINUANCE OF THAT FUND. I AND OUR HOPE IS THAT WITH THE LICENSING FEE INCREASE THAT WILL PROVIDE SUFFICIENT FUNDING. THERE ANY CHANGES THAT NEED TO BE DONE ANY TWEAKS TO THAT OR NEEDS TO BE AN ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OF MONEY PUT INTO THE FUND RIGHT NOW IT'S THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH YEAR. WE ARE ACTIVELY HAVING DISCUSSIONS WITH FOLKS ABOUT THAT. I'VE BEEN NEEDS TO BE INCREASED WITH ADDITIONAL OF MONEY COMING IN FROM LICENSING FEES. THAT MONEY WILL BE AVAILABLE WITHIN GETS OUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND WE ARE WORKING ON THAT RIGHT NOW. SO I JUST WANT TO MENTION THAT THERE ANY QUESTIONS I CAN ADJUST. THANK YOU.

THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE AND SUPPORTS. SING NINE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE OF BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS MISTER KALRA. I THINK IT WAS CHAIR A AND THANK YOU SOME MEMBER OF THE BRASS RING OF FOR THIS BILL AS SOMEONE THAT WORK FOR ELEVEN YEARS THE DEPUTY OF A DEFENDER I CAN. ABSOLUTELY TRUST TO THE WORK THAT WOULD THAT THAT IS DONE EVERY DAY. FIRE COURT REPORTERS. AND THE FACT THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN AN INCREASE IN THE RATE. I IN NO. WHAT'S THAT NOW TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT EIGHT HERE FILE. SO. ANY CASE AYE I APPRECIATE IT AND FOR ALL THE TIMES A COURT REPORTERS TOLD ME TO SLOW DOWN WHEN I WAS THERE.

IF I THINK I CAN GET USED TO BE ON THIS COMMITTEE. APPLAUSE. HONESTLY. I CAN'T CLOSE OFF CAMPUS. MR STONE JACK SEAT. THE TWENTY THREE SEVENTY SIX AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY SIX. AND I'M CERTAINLY TAKING THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE LISTED. FOISTED UPON ME BY AN UNREASONABLE CHAIR BUT THAT'S FINE. SO TAXPAYER LAWSUITS ARE AN IMPORTANT TOOL FOR MEMBERS THE PUBLIC TO KEEP. JURISDICTIONS ACCOUNTABLE. AND THERE'S A RECENT SUPREME COURT CASE THAT SEEMS TO WANT TO LIMIT IT TO THOSE WHO PAY PROPERTY TAX WHICH DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE SINCE THAT THAT'S A A SUBSET OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING. IN ANY THE JURISDICTIONS AND FOR TRULY ONE USES TOOL. TO HOLD JURISDICTIONS ACCOUNTABLE WE NEED TO EXPAND THE HANDS IN FACT IN THAT DECISION THE SUPREME COURT. ASK THE LEGISLATURE TO CLARIFY THIS PARTICULAR SECTION AND ENSURED THAT THAT WE ARE COVERING. TAXES THAT ONE WOULD ASSUME WOULD BE COVERED BY THIS BILL THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT EXPANDS. THOSE WHO WOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO HAVE STANDING TO BRING A SUIT AGAINST A JURISDICTION BECAUSE THEY ARE IN FACT TAXPAYERS. WITH THAT I ASK YOUR AYE VOTES AND I DO HAVE SOME WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. I GOOD MORNING I'M GEN FLORES THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WE'RE PROUD TO SPONSOR AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY SIX WHICH WOULD CLARIFY WHICH TAXPAYERS CONCERT STANDING IN TAXPAYER LAWSUITS. FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR IN THE STAFF FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP AND THAT'S. I WESTERN CENTER HAS HAD A LONG HISTORY OF USING TAXPAYER STANDING SUITS TO ASSERT THEIR RIGHTS OF LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. FOR EXAMPLE IN SERRANO THE PRIEST THE NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE CASE THAT INVALIDATED A CALIFORNIA'S UNJUST SCHOOL FIGHT MANSINGH SYSTEM THAT BECAME BEGAN AS A TAXPAYER STANDING SUIT AGAINST THE LA BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WE WON HANSEN VERSUS DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES A TAXPAYERS STANDING CASE THAT ENSURE THAT CHILDREN COULD NOT BE DENIED ASSISTANCE. ON THE BASIS THAT THEY WERE HOMELESS. HOWEVER NINETEEN NINETY THREE THE CALIFORNIA COURT OF APPEALS IN TAURUS FOUND THAT SALES TAX BECAUSE IT'S TECHNICALLY PAID BY THE RETAILER. COULD NOT CONFER TAXPAYERS STANDING STATUS TRY TELLING A CONSUMER AT A CASH REGISTER WHO'S JUST BEEN CHARGED TO SALES TAX THAT THEY'RE NOT IN FACT PAYING SALES TAX. AS A RESULT IT BECAME UNCLEAR WHICH TAXES COULD CONFER STANDING. TO MANY IT SEEMED PROPERTY TAXES WERE THE ONLY SAFE TAXES EFFECTIVELY BLOCKING LOW INCOME PEOPLE FOR ASSERTING THEIR RIGHTS IN COURT. FAST FORWARD TO TWENTY THIRTEEN. CHARITY WEATHERFORD DECIDES TO CHALLENGE HER CITIES PRACTICE OF AND POUNDING PEOPLE'S CARS WITHOUT NOTICE. DESPITE THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE LAW ON THE FACT THAT SHE IS NOT A PROPERTY TAXPAYER MS WHETHER FOR DESSERT SHE PLACED PAYS PLENTY OF TAXES INCLUDING SALES TAX GAS TAX WATER AND SEWAGE FEES. SO THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE STANDING BOTH THE TRIAL COURT AND THE COURT OF APPEAL FIND THAT PROPERTY TAXES REQUIRE TO CONVERSE STANDING AND REJECT HER ARGUMENT THAT REQUIRING PROPERTY TAX IS DISCRIMINATION BASED ON WEALTH. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT REVIEWED HER CASE AND SPECIFICALLY SAID THAT ONE NEED NOT PAIR PROPERTY TAX TO HAVE STANDING. BUT THEY ALSO NOTED THE ARCHAIC AND UNCLEAR LANGUAGE OF THE STATUTE AND REQUESTED THAT THE LEGISLATURE TAKE ACTION TO CLARIFY THE STATUTE. WHICH BRINGS US TO TODAY. WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IS ASKING THIS BODY TO REOPEN OUR TAXPAYERS STANDING STATUE TO CLARIFY THAT ALL PAIRS OF TAXES HAVE STANDING. PROVIDED THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A CONNECTION TO THE DEFENDANT GOVERNMENT. THIS INCLUDES THOSE TAXES SUCH AS SALES TAX WHICH MAY NOT BE A DIRECT PAYMENT BUT ABSOLUTELY COME OUT AT THE TAXPAYER'S POCKET TO FUND THE DEFENDING GOVERNMENT. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY ARE PAID BY THE LESS WEALTHY MEMBERS OF SOCIETY. FINALLY WERE ALSO ASKING THAT THE WORD CITIZEN BE DELETED FROM THE STATUTE TO ENSURE THAT TAX PAIN IMMIGRANTS ALSO SHARE THE RIGHT TO CHALLENGE THE MISUSE OF THEIR TAXES. IN ESSENCE OF OPRAH TWENTY THREE SEVENTY SIX SIMPLY REPRESENTS THE NOTION THAT IF WE ARE GOING TO ALLOWED FOR A TAXPAYER STANDING STATUE IN THIS STATE. THAN WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW ALL RESIDENTS TO USE IT. WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. THERE'S A MOTION A SECOND AND. ANOTHER WITNESS PART. VERY BRIEFLY MADAM CHAIR KEVIN BAKER FOR THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF CALIFORNIA WE ALSO USED TO STATURE FREQUENTLY. ALL TAXPAYERS SHOULD BE AND ABLE TO CHALLENGE GOVERNMENT WASTE FRAUD AND ABUSE THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE SYSTEM ACCOUNTABLE BUT IT'S NOT JUST SORT OF. MORE PROGRESSIVE GROUPS. IT'S ALSO GROUPS ON ON THE BRIGHTON AND TAXPAYER GROUPS I'M SO WE ASK FOR YOUR EYES. ARE THERE ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR CARE CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA WE FREQUENTLY HAVE TO TURN TO THE COURTS TO ENFORCE RIGHTS OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AND SO WE SUPPORT THIS EFFORT ON TAKING THAT CLOUD THAT. HANGS OVER ON TAXPAYER STANDING SO WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS CLEAR FOR FUTURE CASES THANK YOU. MIKE WE ON WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ROSSI HER SUPPORT. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE. ANY QUESTIONS. LIKE MANY. THE CHAIR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE ISP RATHER. HE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. DO PASS AS AMENDED STONE. I STONE AYE CUNNINGHAM. CUNNINGHAM I. CHAO. CHAU AYE CHIU. GONZALEZ FLETCHER. GONZALEZ FLETCHER AYE HOLDEN. HOLDEN I KALRA. KALRA AYE KILEY. MAIENSCHEIN. RACE. REYES I. THE BILL GETS OUT. THINK IT. SO HAPPILY HIS ADULTS O. WE'VE CHALLENGED OUR PROBE SHARE. TWO RUNNING POLICY COMMITTEE INTEREST. ALRIGHT SO MUCH COLOR YOU READY OKAY. SO WE WILL NOW TAKE UP ITEM NUMBER TWO AB NINETEEN THIRTEEN. KALRA PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. AB NINETEEN THIRTEEN WOULD PROVIDE A TECHNICAL FIX A TO. FORMER SENATOR STEINBERG'S CURRENT MAYOR STEINBERG'S SP FOUR SEVENTY SEVEN FROM TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. WHICH ACQUIRES FOR LABOR CONTRACTORS OR FLC IS TO REGISTER WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR COMMISSIONER. SPECIFICALLY IT WOULD ENSURE THE PROPER IMPLEMENTATION OF SP FOUR SEVENTY SEVEN BY REQUIRING THAT ALL HAVE FOUND SEES AS ORIGINALLY INTENDED. ARE REQUIRED TO REGISTER WITH THE COMMISSION NOT JUST THOSE RECRUIT WORKERS WITH AGE TO BE. VISA CATEGORY. THIS INTENTION HAS BEEN LAID OUT BY NOW MAYOR STEINBERG AND SEVERAL LETTERS LEGISLATURE'S MAZA PRESLEY'S ON THE ISSUE OF THE FAULTY IMPLEMENTATION. AS ESTABLISHED BY S. BEFORE SEVENTY SEVEN CURRENT LAW REQUIRES THAT POLICIES TO REGISTER WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER. REQUIRES EMPLOYERS TO HIRE REGISTERED A POLICIES AND MOST IMPORTANTLY PROVIDES PROTECTIONS AND REMEDIES FOR THOSE FOREIGN WORKERS SOLICITED AND RECRUITED TO WORK TEMPORARILY IN CALIFORNIA. PROTECT THEM FROM HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND OTHER LABOR CODE VIOLATIONS. LABOR AND SEX TRAFFICKING CONTINUE TO BE A PERVASIVE ISSUE IN THE SOLICITATION AND HIRING OF FOREIGN WORKERS UNDER ALL VISA CATEGORIES. OUR SPONSOR AB WORK BUT MANY SUCH INDIVIDUALS. GUSTAVO TO FORTY I'LL DORADO WAS RECRUITED IN TWO THOUSAND TEN. TWO THOUSAND TWELVE MITCHELL CON MEXICO TO WORK CALIFORNIA I'M AGE TO A. B. SEPARATENESS ROBBERIES HE AND THE OTHER FOUR HUNDRED WORKERS WERE PART OF THIS CASE WERE CHARGE. MORE THAN FOURTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS IN KICKBACKS RECRUITMENT COST PLUS ADDITIONAL COSTS FOR TRAVEL. HE AND HIS CO WORKERS WERE THREATENED WITH BLACKLISTING. BY EMPLOYERS AFTER THEY COMPLAINED ABOUT THESE ABUSES. THIS TITLE RETALIATION NEEDS TO BE CURRENT WITH THE PROTECTIONS LAID OUT SP FOUR SEVENTY SEVEN. BY LIMITING OF THE SCOPE OF AS BEFORE SEVEN SEVEN TO APPLE SEES RECRUITING UNDER THE AGE TO BE BE SET ONLY THE VAST MAJORITY A TEMPORARY FOREIGN WORKERS COMING TO CALIFORNIA REMAIN UNPROTECTED AND SUBJECT. THE DOCUMENT ABUSES OF UNSCRUPULOUS AT POLICIES. INSTEAD OF PROTECTING OVER A ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND TEMPORARY WORKERS COMING TO CALIFORNIA. ITS PROTECTIONS ARE ONLY AVAILABLE TO ABOUT THREE THOUSAND TEMPER AGE TO BE WORKERS. AB NINETEEN THIRTEEN PHOTOS THE INTENT OF SP FOUR SEVENTY SEVEN TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT ALL FOREIGN LABOR CONTRACTORS ARE COVERED. WITH ONLY TWO EXCEPTIONS J. ONE VISAS AND TALENT AGENCY RECRUITERS THAT BOTH HAVE MORE STRINGENT STANDARDS. AS A RESULT THE BILL WOULD ALIGN LA TO COMPORT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT AT POLICIES RECRUITING. WORKERS UNDER ALL BASIC CATEGORIES AKA ARE COVERED BY COVERING ALL AT BELL SEES AB NINETEEN THIRTY ONE SURE THAT ALL FARMWORKERS ARE PROTECTED AGAINST WAY EXCEPT HUMAN TRAFFICKING. AND OTHER WORKER ABUSES. ALTHOUGH STAKEHOLDERS IN AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY OF OPPOSE THE BILL FOR US TO GROW UP. IN THE FOOT WITH THEIR ARGUMENT IT'S DUPLICATIVE IN NATURE. OF THEM WITH FARM LABOR CONTRACTING I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A NECESSARY PICKS BECAUSE THE TWO ARE NOT ONE OF THE SAME. FARM LABOR CONTRACTORS OFTEN HIGHER FOREIGN LABOR RECRUITERS TO HANDLE INTERNATIONAL LABOR. THIS BILL WOULD NOT PLACE A DUPLICATIVE BURDEN ON THE FARM LABOR CONTRACTORS BUT DOES REQUIRE THOSE CONTRACTORS TO HIRE RECRUITERS ARE IN COMPLIANCE. WITH ME TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TEST MONEY ARE STEPPING RICHARD FROM THE COALITION AGAINST LABOR AND TRAFFICKING PROFILE BATISTA A SURVIVOR ADVOCATE WHO ESCAPE FROM HUMANE TRAPPING SITUATION. TO BECOME A PARALEGAL AND MEMBER OF SEVERAL SURVIVOR NETWORKS AND A CAIRO MANUALS REPRESENTING THE MAYOR'S OFFICE FOR THE CITY OF SEGMENT. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS BUT. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS STEPHANIE RICHARD I'M TESTIFYING TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE COALITION TO ABOLISH SLAVERY AND TRAFFICKING CAST. AS THE BILL'S SPONSOR. THIS IS A TECHNICAL CORRECTION DISCLAIMERS SP FOUR SEVEN SEVEN WHICH YOU ARE SUPPORTIVE OF MISTER CHAIR WHEN I STOOD BEFORE YOU IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. ASKING FOR THE SAME THING THAT THEY'RE A HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND AND NOW A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND TEMPORARY WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA RECEIVE THE ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS. ON A TUBA TO PROTECT THEM FROM FOR THE FRAUDULENT PRACTICES AFFORD LABOR RECRUITERS THAT LEAD TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING EXPLOITATION. THE QUESTION BEFORE YOU A SIMPLE. IS IT GOOD POLICY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS TO ALL TEMPORARY WORKERS COMING TO CALIFORNIA. I BELIEVE THE ANSWER IS YES BASED ON MY FIRST HAND ON THE GROUND EXPERIENCE OF TRAFFICKING VICTIMS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I ALSO BELIEVE THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND THIS LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR ALREADY ANSWERED THIS QUESTION IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WHEN SP FOUR SEVEN SEVEN WAS SIGNED INTO LAW WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO A DRAFTING ERROR. THAT THE BILL WAS INSERTED UNDER SECTION THAT EXPLICITLY STATED THAT IT ONLY APPLIED TO EACH TO BE WORKERS THAT MEANS IT ONLY COVERS THREE THOUSAND WORKERS NOT THE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND WORKERS WE REGULARLY DISCUSSED. IN ALL THE COMMITTEE HEARINGS. IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NONSENSICAL FOR PASSED THE COMMON FRONT OF YOU. ALONG WITH THE SUPPORT OF THEN THE PER TAM AT THE TIME AND I HOUSE FOR A BILL THAT WITH LIMITED SOLELY TO THE EACH TO BE CLASS. HAD THAT BEEN THE CASE ALSO WE HAVE IT WOULD HAD NO NEED TO ENGAGE IN EXTENSIVE NEGOTIATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS WHICH I WAS PERSONALLY PART OF. COMPROMISE WITH THE J. ONE LOBBY AND OTHER BUSINESS GROUPS TO EXPLICITLY EXCLUDE CERTAIN CATEGORIES. AT THAT TIME. THE PROTECTIONS UNDER S. B. FOUR SEVEN SEVEN ARE ESSENTIAL PERFECT PROTECTING ALL TEMPORARY WORKERS AND DESIGNED TO BE A UNIFORM POLICY. ACROSS CATEGORIES THOUGH THAT WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS HAVE CONSISTENT WERE. REGULATION. I ALSO WANT TO VOTE. NOTE THAT THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS REALLY DID FOCUS ON EACH TO A WORKERS WHICH IS ONLY ABOUT THREE THOUSAND TO FIVE THOUSAND WORKERS. BUT THIS FOR A FOCUS FORGET ABOUT ALL THE OTHER VISA CATEGORIES THAT ARE ALSO CURRENTLY EXCLUDED WHICH INCLUDE A THREE G. FIVE EACH ONE B. O. IP YOU THREE TN EXCEPT ROB. AND WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS THAT WHEN HE TESTIFIED IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT. WAS THAT THERE ARE NUMEROUS REPORTS AND DOCUMENTATIONS THAT THE GREATEST WAY TO PREVENT HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND LABOR EXPLOITATION. IS TO PROTECT TEMPORARY WORKERS AT THE POINT OF RECRUITMENT REGARDLESS OF THE BEAST THE CATEGORY AND THAT IS THE NEW PROTECTIONS THAT ARE JUST NOT EVER SIMPLY CULVERT IN CALIFORNIA LOBBY FOR FEDERALLY. AND THAT'S WHAT I REALLY WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THESE PROTECTIONS COVER UP THE TIME A SOLICITATION. FOR THE WORK AND THAT'S WHEN WE SEE THAT WORKERS OR PROVIDED WITH FALSE INFORMATION DO THINGS LIKE TAKE ON THAT. UP UP UP QUIT JOBS AT THE OR D. HAVE BECAUSE THEY'RE MADE FALSE PROMISES SO THAT THE MAJOR NEW PROTECTION THIS BILL REQUIRES THAT THAT INFORMATION BE PROVIDED AT THE POINT OF SOLICITATION NUCLEAR AS WELL AS. AND THEN FINALLY ON ONE THING THAT CAME UP WITH THE BONDING REQUIREMENT THAT WAS. THERE'S REQUIRED FOR BOTH FOR IN LATE FARM LABOR CONTRACTORS AND FOREIGN LABOR CONTRACTORS. WE MADE VERY CONSIDERABLE CONCESSIONS THAT INVOLVED REMOVING A CRIMINAL LIABILITY FROM EMPLOYERS REMOVING IN. JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY FROM A PLAYER'S AND IT WAS AT THAT TIME THAT THIS VERY COMMITTEE SAID THAT IS WHEN YOU SHOULD INCREASE THE BODY REQUIREMENTS IN THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY. TO PROTECT THE WEARER DO NOT TO MEET THEIR ALPHA SO I THINK YOU FOR. YOUR VOTE FOR THIS BILL. GOOD MORNING WITNESS PLEASE MORNING MY NAME IS ROUGH I WROTE THE STUFF YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. I'M A SURVIVOR OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING I'M ORIGINALLY FROM MEXICO CITY MEXICO. AND I. I WORK EVERY SINGLE DAY DURING THE TWO YEARS THAT I WAS A FORCED TO WORK FOR MY TRAFFICKER RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO.

ANY WORSE OFF THAN WHEN THEY STARTED TRACKING EXPERIENCE. I HAVE MADE SEVERAL STE FELLOW SURVIVORS HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND OTHER PLACES IN CALIFORNIA THAT WERE ACTUALLY WORSE CIRCUMSTANCES THAN ME. ALTHOUGH THEY CAME TO THE UNITED STATES WITH THE LEGAL WORK VISA THESE FELLOWS NOT ONLY HAVE SEVERE FEAR FOR THEIR LIVES. BUT ALSO FOR THEIR FAMILIES IN THEIR HOMETOWN. OF. WHERE THEY WERE RECRUITED BY A? LABOR CONTRACTORS. MANY TIMES THEY TOOK A LOT OF THE ABSENT THEY EVEN SELL THEIR LANDS TO BE ABLE TO PAY THE DEBTS TO COME TO THE UNITED STATES. IN THEIR HOME COUNTRY. BOB THESE BE SAYS THEY WERE COMING ON WILL GET THEM A GREEN CAR. AND THEN THE TEMPORARY WAR WAS ONLY FOR THREE TO SIX MONTHS BECAUSE THEY CALL NOT PAY. THAT THEY HAVE THEY TOOK IN. THERE WERE AFRAID TO FUND WILL HAPPEN TO THEIR FAMILY. WORKERS NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE PAIN RECRUITMENT FREEZE FOR TEMPORARY WORK VISAS TO COME TO UNITED STATES. THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT TURNS AND CONTRACTS THEY ARE COMING ON THEIR. OWN THEIR AND THAT THESE CONTRACTS TERMS CANNOT BE CHANGED THEY NEED. THEY NEED A WAY TO FIND A LIST OF SAVED RECRUITMENT. OR TRUST TO GIVE THEM. LEGITIMATE JOBS AND OPPORTUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA THE PROTECTIONS IN AS BEFORE SEVENTY SEVEN WILL HELP SO MANY WORKERS AND PREVENT HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN CALIFORNIA. I WAS SO SAD TO LEARN THAT IS BEFORE SEVENTY SEVEN. WHICH WAS A PASSENGER DOESN'T FOURTEEN AND SHOULDN'T. ENSURE HAVE GONE INTO EFFECT IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN IS STILL NOT PROVIDING THE PROTECTION TO ALL TEMPORARY WORKERS. WHO NEED IT? I CAN ENSURE THAT BY PASSING. I CAN ASSURE YOU.

I'M BRIAN LITTLE WITH THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION AND I'M HERE TO RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR OPPOSITION DAY BE NINETEEN THIRTEEN. WE'RE CONCERNED THAT AB NINETEEN THIRTEEN IMPOSES AN ADDITIONAL. REPUBLICAN OF REGULATORY INFRASTRUCTURE ON FARM LABOR CONTRACTORS TO USE THE H. TO A PROGRAM. WE VIA FARM LABOR CONTRACTOR LICENSING REQUIREMENTS UNDER CURRENT STATE LAW IN ADDITION TO THE REQUIREMENTS FOR USERS OF THE H. TO A. TEMPORARY NON IMMIGRANT VISA PROGRAM. I ALREADY PROVIDE AMPLE PROTECTION FOR WORKERS THAT ARE WORKING CALIFORNIA UNDER THIS PROGRAM. AND SO OUR CONCERN IS THAT YOU WILL HAVE THE EFFECT OF DISCOURAGING. FARM LABOR CONTRACTORS FROM ENGAGING IN FOREIGN LABOR CONTRACTING ACTIVITY AND FARM LABOR CONTRACTORS PUT. PERFORM A VERY IMPORTANT FUNCTION. FOR OUR CULTURE CALIFORNIA BEING THE GO BETWEEN BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND WORKERS WHO DON'T HAVE PERFECT INFORMATION ABOUT SEASONS AND AVAILABILITY OF WORKERS. ALLOW GROWERS TO HAVE MORE CONTINUOUS SUPPLY OF LABOR AND MORE RELIABLE SUPPLY OF LABOR IN ALLOW WORKERS TO WORK MORE WEEKS IN ANY GIVEN YEAR. IMPROVING THEIR INCOME. AND SO IN THE OVERALL SENSE OF THE CONCERN WE HAVE ABOUT THIS. ASSEMBLY. DUPLICATIVE REGULATION OF FARM LABOR CONTRACTORS ARE ENGAGING IN THE H. TO A PROGRAM FOR THOSE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS WITHOUT GOOD MORNING MATTHEW ARNOLD WAS FROM GORGEOUS SOCIAIS XIN I WOULD LARGELY LARGELY ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE BY A MISTER LITTLE FROM THE FARM BUREAU.

A WE BELIEVE IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S THIS IS NOT A TECHNICAL CLEAN UP OF THE BILL IT'S VERY EXPLICIT IN THE STATUTE THAT IS NOT APPLICABLE TO THE H. TO A WORKERS WHO ARE COVERED UNDER THE EXISTING FIVE FARM LABOR CONTRACTING PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA. THAT HAS A LONG HISTORY OF OF BEING EFFECTIVE PROGRAM THAT HAS DIMINISHED WAGE THEFT IN OUR INDUSTRY. AND OUR HUMAN TRAFFICKING LOVE FROM EVER CONTRACTORS ALSO HAVE A SPECIFIC POSTING REQUIREMENT THAT UNIQUE TO OUR INDUSTRY WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND WE HAVE TO DO THAT SPECIFIC POSTING REQUIREMENT. THROUGH THE AG AT THAT OUR WORKPLACES SO OUR INDUSTRY IS HEAVILY REGULATED HERE WERE RIGHT ABOUT. AN UNNECESSARY DUPLICATIVE REGULATIONS THIS POINT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION.

CAN'T ADMIT THAT SENATOR STEINBERG MADE A MISTAKE. AND BESIDES IT'S MOOT BECAUSE WHAT'S BEFORE US IS SOMETHING THAT THIS BODY THIS LEGISLATURE IS FRITO MAD IN ANY CASE. AND. YOU HAVE MY SUPPORT MISTER KALRA ON THIS BILL THE ONE THING THAT I DO WANT TO RAISE WHICH WAS RAISE THE ANALYSIS IS THAT SINCE. WE ARE ADDING IN IT AND IT IS SOME QUESTIONABLE ABOUT WHETHER. FARMERS ARE. HIGHER FARM LABOR CONTRACTORS OR NOT THERE IS A POTENTIAL FOR DUPLICATIVE FEES DUPLICATIVE. BONDING THE WAY THIS IS POTENTIALLY SET UP IT'S IT'S NOT NECESSARILY ISSUE HERE BUT I HOPE IS THIS MOVES FORWARD THAT THAT. ESSENTIALLY GETS ADDRESSED AND ANSWERED SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE A SITUATION WHERE WE'RE ADDING. WE DON'T WANT ON TOP OF THE OTHER WHERE IT'S NOT JUSTIFIED OR WHETHER IT'S NOT. NOT A REASON FOR THEIR COULD BE REASON FOR IT THERE. DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WAS NOT NECESSARILY. CLEAR IN THAT SENTENCE IT WAS PHRASED AS CLEANING UP THEN I DON'T KNOW THAT. THAT LET'S LET'S LOOK AHEAD LET'S LOOK AT THIS POLICY ON ITS OWN AND MAKE SURE THAT IT MAKES SENSE IN THE BROADER CONTEXT THAT'S ALL THAT I'M ASKING. OTHER QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS.

I OR TO PROTECT WORKERS A AND THE INTENSELY NOT TO CREATE DUPLICATIVE EITHER FEES OR REGULATION BUT ACTUALLY. UP THERE ARE MEANINGFUL PROTECTIONS UNIQUE TO THEIR RECRUITMENT OF FOREIGN LABOR. THAT APPLY AND PLUS WE CANNOT ESCAPE THE FACT THAT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WE'RE SEEING THE BALL BACK OF MANY REGULATIONS THAT PROTECT WORKERS AND SO. THIS IS ACTUALLY A ALSO A. A A WAY OF BEING PROACTIVE TO ENSURE THAT WE PROTECT OUR WORKERS THE BEST EXTENT POSSIBLE. AS WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY BOOK THANK YOU.

YOU PAY WAS ADOPTED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE TO ELIMINATE DISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT OF NON MARITAL CHILDREN AND TWO YEARS AGO. THE UNIFORM LA COMMISSION A NON PARTISI PARTISAN ADVISORY GROUP FOR THE U. PA AUTHORIZED TO REVISION OF THE UPI TO ENSURE EQUAL PROTECTION. FOR CHILDREN OF SAME SEX COUPLES. AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY FOUR INCORPORATES THESE CHANGES FROM THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE. RELEVANT FOR CALIFORNIA LAWS CALIFORNIA OF COURSE HAS LONG BEEN A TRAILBLAZER IN PROTECTING LGBT INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR CHILDREN THIS BILL ENSURES THAT WE CONTINUE ON THAT PATH AND UPDATES LAWS.

MEND YOUR THEIR STORY. IS IT WOULD WHICH ONCE THE WITNESS THE ONE WITH THE FEAR ABOUT. TAKE A WILD GUESS MISTER. FIRST WITNESS. YOU THINK YOU THINK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND MAY MISS KATHY SAKE MORA AND I'M THE FAMILY LAW DIRECTOR AT THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR LESBIAN RIGHTS. I'M EVERY YEAR WE RECEIVE CALLS FROM HUNDREDS OF PARENTS SEEKING TO PROTECT THEIR RIGHTS TO THEIR CHILDREN. AND OFTEN THE ONLY OPTION AVAILABLE TO THEM IS TO GET AN ADOPTION OR A COURT ORDER WHICH FOR PARENTS OF A NEW BABY IS QUITE CUMBERSOME. AND CAN BE PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE BUT CALIFORNIA ALREADY PROVIDES A FREE SIMPLE PROCESS AVAILABLE TO FATHERS IN HOSPITALS TO PROTECT THEIR RIGHTS. OMINOUS BILL WOULD MAKE THAT EQUALLY AVAIL AVAILABLE TO SAME SEX PARENTS WHO CONCEIVED THROUGH ASSISTED REPRODUCTION. IT WOULD ALSO MODERNIZE CALIFORNIA'S GENETIC TESTING A PROVISIONS WHICH ARE OUTDATED. AND WOULD CODIFY CALIFORNIA CASE LAW ABOUT HOW GENETIC TESTING IS CONSIDERED IN CASES INVOLVING NON BIOLOGICAL PARENTS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION I URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU LET'S PUT.

SECOND YOU MAKE ROOM FOR THE OPPOSITION AT THE TABLE. MY MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS KEVIN BAKER PROTECT CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION THAT'S CALIFORNIA WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A POSITION ON THE BILL AS IT'S OPPOSED TO BE AMENDED SINCE WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE LANGUAGE OF THAT. THOSE AMENDMENTS I'M SO AND I CAN ONLY SPEAK GENERALLY TO THE ISSUE HARM. WITH RESPECT TO THE PAIN IN THE TRAGEDY HAVE EXPERIENCED BY THE WITNESS I THINK WE ALL HAVE. GREAT APPRECIATION FOR FOUND THAT SITUATION I THINK THE QUESTION IS WHETHER ON CUTTING BACK ON THE SCOPE OF THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT IN SOME WAY. IS GOING TO BELIEVER AVOID THAT. THAT KIND. AND I'M I'M I'M NOT AT ALL SURE THAT THAT IT WOULD COME IN THE LAST WEEK I WOULD LIKE TO REVIEW THE AMENDMENTS WHEN THEY'RE. IN PRINT AND WILL. TECHNO LOOK AT THE BILL AT THAT TIME. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JIM YOU WORK WITH A CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION. A WE ALSO SYMPATHIZE WITH. VICTIMS OF A VIOLENT CRIME IN A GANG ACTIVITY. BUT ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT WAS CREATED WITH A PRESUMPTION OF ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION ABOUT WITNESSES AND VICTIMS. IN ORDER FOR THE COMMUNITY ITSELF TO UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF CRIME ARE IN IT IN THE AREA WHERE. PEOPLE LIVE ON AND ALSO TO HELP PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM THAT CRIME. AND ANY DIMINISHMENT OF ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION. DISABLED PEOPLE FROM BEING ABLE TO DO THAT. AND WHAT WE WOULD NEVER SUGGEST THAT PUBLIC ACCESS SHOULD ALWAYS TRUMP. THE PERSONAL SAFETY OF SOMEONE WHO WAS A VICTIM OR WITNESS. THE LAW CURRENTLY ALLOWS WHO FOR AMECHANISM TO BE USED WHEN THERE IS A THREAT TO A VICTIM A WITNESS OR THE INVESTIGATION ITSELF WE THINK THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE STANDARD AND. IF THERE IS ANYONE ANYWHERE WHERE REFORM. SHOULD BE FOCUSED IT IS ON THAT WHERE IT MAY BE DEFECTIVE OR INADEQUATE IN PROTECTING. OF VICTIMS OR WITNESSES WE THINK THAT THAT IS WHERE. THE FOCUS SHOULD BE. I'M WITH RESPECT TO THE AMENDMENT WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE LANGUAGE EITHER. UP BASED ON THE DESCRIPTION IN THE ANALYSIS. WERE CONCERNED THAT IT MIGHT EXTEND AND GO BROADER THAN THAT WHICH IS CURRENTLY IN THE BILL NOW. ALLOWING FOR ANYONE INVOLVED IN INVESTIGATION TO MAKE THE REQUEST. UP BUT AGAIN WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON THAT YET AND. WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE LANGUAGE BEFORE. TAKING POSITIONS. APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION NO WITH CONCERNS. SEE NONE OF BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AND. I AGREE THAT WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH PUBLIC RECORDS PUBLIC RECORDS ACT IS BUT THERE FOR A VERY SPECIFIC REASON. BUT AS WE'VE SEEN THROUGH. HISTORY OUT OF THIS HOUSE AND AND OTHERS THERE THERE ARE TIMES WHERE WE CAN WE NEED TO BE MORE PROTECTIVE LESS PROTECTIVE AND SO THESE CONVERSATIONS. TRY TO FIND A BALANCE BETWEEN WHAT THE PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY IN OUR SOCIETY. SARRIS ACT YEAH AGAINST TRYING TO PROTECT FOLKS IS REALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SEE. SO WILL WILL STAY IN TOUCH WITH RESPECT TO THE MEMBERS THAT WE'RE PROPOSING WE'RE TRYING THAT. HELP FACILITATE SOME OF THAT BALANCE HERE SO THAT WE DON'T FRUSTRATE THE PURPOSES OF WHAT THE AUTHORS ARE INTENDING. BUT BUT ALSO NOT UNNECESSARILY. LIMIT ACCESS. QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SEEING NONE SETTLEMENT. TO MAKE LOVE SUDDEN MISTER CHAIR I WOULD JUST CLOSE BY SAYING I DO BELIEVE THAT THE AMENDED BILL. STRIKES THE PROPER BALANCE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR RIDE. THANK YOU SECRECY. RIGHT. SO STILL LOOKING FOR A MOTION THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROACH. WE DO HAVE NO EMOTION AND THE SECONDS.

THAT BILLS OUT THANK YOU MISTER HICKMAN DO VERY MUCH. THAT BRINGS US UP TO ITEM NUMBER NINE AB TWENTY NINE FORTY THREE MISTER LOW GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ON ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY NINE FORTY THREE. TO CLARIFY THAT CONVERSION THERAPY IS THAT FRAUDULENT PRACTICE UNDER THE CONSUMER LEGAL REMEDIES ACT. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REPRESENT THIS BILL THAT AS YOU HAVE SEEN IN THE ANALYSIS AND AS WELL STATED AND WELL KNOWN. OF FRAUDULENT PRACTICES. WITH RESPECT TO SOMETHING LIKE CONVERSION THERAPY IS SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD ARTICULATE AND ARGUE WOULD SUGGEST TO YOU AFFECT THE AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION THE AMERICAN COUNSELING ASSOCIATION THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION. OF SOCIAL WORKERS THEY AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION ALL ALSO BELIEVE THAT CONVERSION THERAPY A DOES NOT WORK AND THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO IT'S IS IT SUGGESTS THAT IT DOES WORK AND IN FACT IT DOES. SIGNIFICANT HARM TO ONCE MENTAL HEALTH. THIS BILL WOULD NARROWLY APPLY IN CASES WHERE CONSUMER TRANSACTION HAS TAKEN PLACE. AND. WITH ME TODAY ARE DOCTOR DOUG HOW THE MEN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION. SAM BRITAIN A SURVIVOR OF CONVERSION THERAPY. MATTHEW SUREKHA SURVIVOR OF CONSERVATIVE CONVERSION THERAPY AND ANTHONY SAMPSON. I ALSO TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT BUTTON WITH RESPECT ASK ARRIVAL. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS DOCTOR DOUG HALDEMAN I AM THE IMMEDIATE PAST PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION AND PROFESSOR AND CHAIR OF THE DOCTORAL PROGRAM IN CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY. AT JOHN F. KENNEDY UNIVERSITY IN PLEASANT HILL THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION IN AGREEMENT WITH EVERY MAJOR HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES. BELIEVES THAT THERE IS NO BASIS FOR ATTEMPTING TO CHANGE SEXUAL ORIENTATION FOR SEVERAL REASONS FIRST SAME SEX ATTRACTIONS AND BEHAVIORS ARE A NORMATIVE ASPECT OF THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE AND NOT A FORM OF MENTAL ILLNESS REQUIRING. TREATMENT. TWO THERE IS NO EVIDENCE. SUPPORTING EFFORTS TO CHANGE SEXUAL ORIENTATION AS SHOWN BY AN EXTENSIVE REVIEW OF THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE. BY THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION THREE THESE METHODS POSE A SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF HARM TO THE INDIVIDUAL AND LASTLY THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER THERAPEUTICALLY LEGITIMATE METHODS FOR ADDRESSING THE CONCERNS. OF PERSONS WHO ARE QUESTIONING OR CONFUSED ABOUT THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION WITHOUT RESORTING TO CONVERSION THERAPY. FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS I HAVE CONDUCTED RESEARCH WRITTEN ORGANIZATIONAL POLICY AND MAINTAINED A CLINICAL PRACTICE THAT INCLUDED HUNDREDS OF BOYS AND MEN WHO HAD UNDERGONE. SOME FORM OF SO CALLED CONVERSION THERAPY INCLUDING AVERSIVE INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS GENITAL ELECTRIC SHOCK AND NAUSEA AND DO. DRUGS A VARIETY OF BEHAVIORAL METHODS RESIDENTIAL TREATMENTS INVOLVING FORCED ISOLATION AND SO FORTH. CONSISTENT WITH THE LACK OF EMPIRICAL SUPPORT FOR CONVERSION TREATMENTS NONE OF THESE METHODS WAS EFFECTIVE IT CHANGING ONES SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND USUALLY EXACERBATED THE PERSON'S ALREADY SUBSTANTIAL GUILT. AND SELF LOATHING. MANY OF THESE PATIENTS REPORTED THAT THEIR CONVERSION THERAPISTS HAD LIED TO THEM ABOUT SAME SEX ATTRACTIONS WHO TOLD THEM THAT THERE QUOTE GAY MENTAL ILLNESS WAS THE RESULT OF EARLY LIKE SEXUAL TRAUMA. OR BLAME TO THEM FOR NOT TRYING HARD ENOUGH NGUYEN CONVERSION THERAPY. THERAPY ULTIMATELY FAILED THEM. MANY REPORTED THAT THEIR CONVERSION THERAPISTS ADMONISHED THEM TO CHANGE THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION BECAUSE GAY PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE INVARIABLY MISERABLE DEVOID OF PRODUCTIVITY MEANING OR FULFILLING RELATIONSHIPS. IF THESE KINDS OF MESSAGES ARE THERE FREE SPEECH THAT CONVERSION THERAPIST SEEK THEY WOULD DO WELL TO READ OUR CODE OF ETHICS WHICH PROHIBITS THE WILLFUL DISSEMINATION. OF INACCURATE STATEMENTS IN THE SERVICE OF PROMOTING THE METHODS AND MANIPULATING CLIENTS. AFTER DECADES OF WORKING WITH SURVIVORS OF CONVERSION THERAPY I'M ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED THAT THESE TREATMENTS HOLD OUT FALSE HOPE TO THOSE WHO ARE DEALING WITH CONFLICT ABOUT THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION DERIVED. FROM A HOMOPHOBIC SOCIAL WORLD. THESE METHODS DON'T WORK AND POSE SUBSTANTIAL RISK TO THE INDIVIDUAL. ACCORDINGLY CPA BELIEVES THAT IT IS IN THE INTEREST OF THE STATE. IT IS ACTUALLY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE TO ACCURATELY IDENTIFY THESE PRACTICES AS CONSUMER FRAUD. PLACING SUCH ACTIVITIES ARE TO THE CONSUMER IS. BUT LEGAL REMEDIES ACT SERVES TO PUT THE PURVEYORS OF CONVERSION THERAPIES ON NOTICE THAT THEY CAN NO LONGER GET AWAY WITH THESE PRACTICES AND SENDS A MESSAGE TO LGBT AND QUESTIONING PERSON OF ALL AGES. THAT THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION THANK YOU THAT'S WITH US. SURE STONE AND FELLOW MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SHARE MY THOUGHTS ON THIS CRITICAL LEGISLATION. THE TREVOR PROJECT IS PLEASED TO CO SPONSOR A BETWEEN I'M FORTY THREE WHICH AT THAT CODIFY THAT MAKES IT SPLIT IN CALIFORNIA LAW. THAT EFFORTS TO CHANGE PERSON FEATURING TATIAN. ARE THE FRAUDULENT BUSINESS PRACTICE UNDER THE CONSUMER LEGAL REMEDIES ACT. AS THE LEADING NATIONAL ORGANIZATION FIGHTING CRISIS INTERVENTION AND SUICIDE PREVENTION SERVICES FOR LGBTQ YOUTH THE TREVOR PROJECT. URGES THE SUPPORT OF LEGISLATION TO PROTECT THE ULTRA COMMUNITY FROM CONVERSION THERAPY. CONVERSION THERAPIES THERAPISTS USE ME FALSELY CLAIM TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE US INTO STRAIGHT AND THIS GENDER PEOPLE PROMINENT HEALTH ASSOCIATIONS INCLUDING THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION AND OTHERS. OPPOSE THE USE OF CONVERSION THERAPY CALLING THE PRACTICE HARMFUL AND INEFFECTIVE. FOLLOWING CALIFORNIA'S LEAD ONLY ELEVEN STATES TOTAL HAVE PASSED LEGISLATION LIMITING THE A PRACTICE ON YOUTH THOUGH ANOTHER THIRTY NINE STATES STILL ALLOW THIS TERRIBLE CRISIS TO CONTINUE. OUR DRIVER PROJECTS LIFELINE FREQUENTLY RECEIVES CALLS OF LGBTQ YOUTH IN CRISIS STEMMING FROM THEIR EXPERIENCES IN CONVERSION THERAPY AND AIMS ADVOCATE PREVENTS WILL END OF THE STATE THING XIN CONVERSION THERAPY. THERAPY ACROSS THE COUNTRY VIA OUR FIFTY BILL FIFTY STATE CAMPAIGN. I'M A SURVIVOR OF CONVERSION THERAPY. THE DANGEROUS DISCREDITED FRAUDULENT IDEA THE THERAPIST COULD CHANGE MY SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR MY GENDER IDENTITY ALTHOUGH SOME MAY SAY THE CONVERSION THERAPY SHOULD BE ALLOWED OF THE CHOICE. I SIMPLY REPLY THAT I NEVER CHOSE THE THERAPY MY. MY FAMILY SUBJECTED ME TO DURING MY FORMATIVE YEARS OF THE CHILD. MY EXPERIENCE OF THE INVERSION THERAPY RANGE FROM TALKING ABOUT LIKE BEATS REJECTION OF MY BISEXUALITY ALL THE WAY TO PHYSICALLY AVERSIVE THAT TECHNIQUES. LIKE THE APPLICATION OF HEAT ICE AND ELECTRICITY TO MY BODY TO FORCIBLY TRAIN ME TO HAVE HETEROSEXUAL ATTRACTION. TO RESPOND TO THE PAINFUL YEARS I NOW SERVE AS THE COACH OF THE BORN PERMITTED BY THE COMMITTEE AND THE HEAD OF ADVOCACY IN GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR THE TREVOR PROJECT. YOU'VE CALL THINK CRISIS AND SUICIDE NEEDING SOMEONE TO SPEAK TO WHEN THEY FEEL ALONE AND SCARED NOT ALL THESE YOU FOR VICTIMS OF CONVERSION THERAPY BUT ALL HAVE BEEN WOUNDED BY A CULTURE. THAT ALLOWS THE FALSE IDEA OF THE CHOICE OF ONE FACTUAL LIGHT ORIENTATION TO PERMIT VIOLENCE BULLYING AND FAMILY REJECTION IN OUR RESEARCH WITH THE BILLIONS INSTITUTE WE NOW I THINK THAT ESTIMATE THAT SEVEN HUNDRED. THOUSAND LGBTQ PEOPLE HAVE EXPERIENCED CONVERSION THERAPY. EIGHTY THOUSAND YOUTH ARE STILL AT RISK OF CONVERSION THERAPY IN THE COMING YEARS. YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO STOP THAT NUMBER FROM CONTINUING TO GROW. CONVERSION THERAPY DOES NOT HAVE A SCIENTIFIC STANDING THEY ARE STEALING FROM HARD WORKING AMERICAN FAMILIES WERE BEING SWINDLED WHILE TRYING TO HAVE THE BEST INTEREST OF THEIR CHILDREN AT HEART. THIS IS CONSUMER FRAUD AND COURTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE AGREED ON THIS POINT TIME AND TIME AGAIN BY NOTIFYING THE SNAKE OIL SALESMAN THAT PEDAL CONVERSION THERAPY TO UNSUSPECTING PARENTS. THAT THEIR PRACTICE VIOLATES CUT CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS IF LEGISLATION WHAT CAUGHT MY PROTECTION THINK OF THE THOUSANDS OF LIVES. THEY CAN'T CHANGE WHAT WE NEVER CHOSE. THANK YOU. EXPLICITLY. ARMENIANS MATTHEW SUREKHA I AIMED AT ME CONVERSION THERAPY SURVIVOR MEANING I HAD GONE THROUGH THE THERAPY AND I'M AN OUT GAY MAN TODAY. MUSCLE LEAD ADVOCATE FOR THE POOR PERFECT CAMPAIGN AND ON THE. ADVISER ABOUT THE COMMITTEE FOR ME ADVISER ON THE COMMITTEE FOR BOARD PREDICTS. AND. I WAS PRETTY CONVERSION THEIR BEAT EACH SIXTEEN WHEN I CAME OUT TO MY PARENTS I WAS TREATED IN FOUR DIFFERENT STATES ARM SPECIFICALLY WAS TREATED IN CALIFORNIA FOR TWO YEARS. ARMED. I WANT TO SPECIFICALLY FOCUS ON THE FRAUDULENT PART BUT IN TOTAL I WAS. THE CONVERSION EVERY FROM AGE SIXTEEN TO TWENTY ONE FOR FIVE YEARS TWO BY FOUR DIFFERENT LICENSED PROFESSIONALS. MY PARENTS SPENT THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS ON MY CONVERSION THERAPY. WHAT I WAS TOLD MY FIRST BEGAN CONVERSION THERAPY WAS THAT BECAUSE I WAS SIXTEEN YEARS OLD AND I HAD ENGAGE IN SAME SEX INTERCOURSE THAT I PROBABLY WOULD BE? SEE MY OPPOSITE SEX ATTRACTION COME BACK WITHIN SIX WEEKS. WHEN THAT DIDN'T WORK. LIKE BEYOND THE JOHN HERE SAID. THE BLAME IS ON ME BECAUSE I WANT TO NOT TRY HARD ENOUGH. OREGON UNDERSTAND WHERE THE TRUMP WAS WHAT CAUSED NAM SEXUALITY. SO I MENTALLY BEGAN. ATTORNEY ON TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHERE MY HOMOSEXUALITY CAME FROM USUALLY AT THE BLAME A PARENT OR AN INCIDENT THAT HAPPENED IN CHILDHOOD. LUCKY FOR ME I WAS I COME FROM A LOVING FAMILY A GROUP IN A CONSERVATIVE HOME WHERE MY PARENTS. I WOULD SAY THAT A GREAT JOB. BOB AND RELAXING NOTHING SPECIFIC I COULD ACTUALLY DISCOVER. BOB BECAUSE I KNEW OF MY SEXUALITY WASN'T EVER CHANGING. MY DEPRESSION GREW OF THE FEARS OF WHAT IT IS TO COME OUT AS A GAY MAN BASED ON WHAT MY FATHER FEARED ABOVE MY CONVERSION THERAPIST FEARED. MY DEPRESSION A INCREASED AND I CONTEMPLATED A POSSIBLE SUICIDE FOR FOR TWO YEARS. A PART OF THE THERAPY WAS ALSO TWO SEPARATE FROM AL FEMALES I HAD TO GO THROUGH A DEFECT IN NUYS EIGHT. D. FEMINIZED PROCESS SO I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY RULES WITH MALES AND FEMALES AND ESSENTIALLY DO NOT SPEAK TO MY MOTHER TO SUGGEST FOR THREE YEARS. WITH ALL THAT SAID AND DONE AND THAT IS THE EXPERIENCE OF IT. WHAT WE'RE SEEING TODAY IS HOW CONVERSION THERAPIES ROUND AS A BUSINESS MY PARENTS SPENT THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS? AND WHAT WAS. THE WORDS ARE BEING USED THERE'S REPAIRED IF THEY'RE BEING CONVERSION THERAPY WHICH ARE INTERCHANGEABLE AND WE'D REALLY DISCUSS THIS TOPIC AS ANYONE WHO'S ATTEMPTING TO CHANGE SOMEONE'S SEXUAL ORIENTATION. PREPARED IF THERE BE IS ATTORNEY BEEN USED A LOT IN. IT THE LAST FEW DECADES ARMED IN MA'AM I MEAN JUST BECAUSE YOU SENIOR WHO PASSED AWAY AT LEAST LATE LAST EARLY LAST YEAR. AND THE SON OF JUST INEQUALITY JUNIOR NAM IS CONTINUING THE BUSINESS AND HAS TWO NEW OFFICES ONE IN MANHATTAN AND ONE IN WEST HOLLYWOOD CALIFORNIA. HE IS OUR RECENTLY TRADEMARKED. REPAIRED IF THERE BE AND THAT'S WITH THE U. S. TPO. THAT'S A GREAT CONCERN BECAUSE IT'S NO LONGER JUST DESCRIBED AS A THERAPY BUT DESCRIBE THE PRODUCTS THAT IT IS FOR SALE. OF COURSE MY PARENTS AGUIAR WITH WHAT TOM. PEEL LIKE A PROFESSIONAL TO TREAT ME ARM BUT. OBVIOUSLY I'M THEY ALMOST LOST ME IF I COMMITTED SUICIDE I LOST MY MOTHER FOR THREE YEARS WITH THE STRAIN FOR MY ENTIRE FAMILY FOR TOTAL FIVE. AND LIKELY TO REBUILD THAT. BUT JUST SO WE UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING A MEDICAL ORGANIZATION HAS DENOUNCED CONVERSION OR PREPARED IF THERE'D BE. PREPARED IF THERE BE SIR I NEED YOU TO WRAP UP THIS YEAR. IN AND OF ITSELF IS SAYING THAT THERE'S IT'S GOING AGAINST WHAT THE MEDICAL PROCEDURE SAYING THAT BECAUSE IT WOULD REPAIRS ANY. IT'S FRAUDULENT FROM BEFORE EVEN BEGAN BECAUSE IT'S SAYING THAT THERE'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED WHICH IS. ANYTHING OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY.

CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS KEVIN SNYDER WITH PACIFIC JUSTICE INSTITUTE CENTER FOR PUBLIC POLICY WHERE SERVICE CHIEF COUNSEL. I DRESSED BRIEFLY THE LEGAL DISCUSSION IN THE BILL'S ANALYSIS. THIS BILL DIFFERS SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE LAW BANNING SEXUAL ORIENTATION CHANGE EFFORTS OR SOCIAL FOR THOSE UNDER EIGHTEEN. TWO CASES CHALLENGED THAT LAW UNDER FREE SPEECH AND FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGION IN PICK UP VERSES BROWN AND PICK AND WELSH FORCES BROWN. THE COURT HELD THAT A PROHIBITION ON SO SHHH. PERSONS UNDER EIGHTEEN SURVIVED TO THESE CHALLENGES BECAUSE THE LAW WAS NARROWLY FOCUSED ON THE REGULATION OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT. BUT THE NINTH CIRCUIT FOUND THAT EVEN LICENSED PROFESSIONALS COULD COMMUNICATE WITH THE PUBLIC ABOUT SOCIAL. IN CONTRAST THIS BILL PROHIBITS SOCIAL ADVERTISEMENTS BY ALL PERSONS. FURTHER THE COURT FOUND THAT LICENSED PROFESSIONALS COULD CONTINUE TO RECOMMEND SOCIAL TO PATIENTS AND COULD ADMINISTER SOCIAL TO ADULTS AND REFER MINERS TO UNLICENSED COUNSELORS OR RELIGIOUS LEADERS. GET UNDER THIS BILL ALL OF THOSE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS ARE SWEPT AWAY. AB TWENTY NINE FORTY THREE IS NOT A REGULATION OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT RATHER THAN THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE. UNLIKE THE PREVIOUS LAW THIS BILL STRETCHES FAR BEYOND LICENSE MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. IT REACHES OF RELIGIOUS MINISTRIES ENGAGED IN SOCIAL. IF THERE IS AN EXCHANGE OF MONEY FOR EXAMPLE PAIN FOR A RELIGIOUS RETREAT A WORKBOOK OR SEMINAR. I DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION TO WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE AN AND NOT IN ANOTHER STATE. TWO MONTHS AGO A CHURCH PUT ON A SEMINAR THAT DEALT WITH THIS VERY ISSUE THIS HAPPENED IN MICHIGAN. FIVE STATE LAWMAKERS URGE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO INVESTIGATE AND FILE AN INJUNCTION AGAINST THE CHURCH FOR VIOLATION. FOR VIOLATING THE COULD MICHIGAN CONSUMER PROTECTIONS ACT. CHAIRMAN I URGE THAT THE MEMBERS OF OF THIS BODY CAST A NO VOTE. AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR. DELIBERATION AND FOR YOUR SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY. THANK. THAT'S WHAT. I THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBERS FOR YOUR TIME. MY NAME IS KEN WILLIAMS AND I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE I DON'T WANT LGBTQ PEOPLE TO HAVE ANY RIGHTS TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM I BELIEVE THEY DESERVE EVERY OPTION TO PURSUE HAPPINESS THE WAY THEY DETERMINE IT. AND THIS BILL WHICH ARE TO PROTECT THEM I BELIEVE WE'RE ACTUALLY RIPPED AWAY SOME ENELE INALIENABLE RIGHTS. TO PURSUE HAPPINESS. I WAS CONFUSED ABOUT MY GENDER LIKE THAT LIKE THE GENTLEMAN. MENTION BEFORE THAT THEY HAD. SOME CONFUSION AND AND WHERE ON A JOURNEY TO FIND THEMSELVES SEXUALLY I CAN RELATE TO THEM AND. AND I CAN FEEL THAT PAIN. I DIDN'T FIT IN WITH THE BOYS OR THE GIRLS EVER IN MY CHILDHOOD. AND ONE MY SEXUAL DESIRES EMERGE THEY WERE ONLY FOR MEN. AND THAT WAS REALLY DEVASTATING FOR ME IT WAS VERY CONFUSING. AND THAT AT SEVENTEEN I WAS I CRASHED EMOTIONALLY AND I WAS. TENTH CONTEMPLATING SUICIDE ON A ON A DAILY BASIS FOR A LONG TIME. I TOLD MY PARENTS FINALLY I BROKE DOWN WE CRIED TOGETHER THEY SAID THEY LOVE ME NO MATTER WHAT. AND THEY ASKED ME HOW THEY COULD HELP. WE FOUND A THERAPIST WHO WOULD HELP ME PURSUE MIGHT MY OPTION. AT WHICH I'M I WANTED CHANGE I WANTED TO LIVE AS A MAN HETEROSEXUALLY. AND I DEVOURED THE FEW BOOKS AND RESOURCES THAT WERE AVAILABLE I DEVOURED THEM AND I JOINED A GROUP. AND SOME OF US EXPERIENCE THE CHANGES THAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR IN THAT GROUP NOT EVERYONE DID. DESPITE YEARS OF HOMOSEXUAL IDENTITY AND BEHAVIOR MY SEXUAL DESIRES THAT DID CHANGE. I'M NO LONGER SEXUALLY ATTRACTED TO MEN. AND I I IN MEDI GIRL AND. DON'T LOVE WITH HER. WAS SEXUALLY AROUSED BY HER AND I MARRIED HER IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX. SHE'S THE ONE PERSON WHO THROWS ME SEXUALLY. I'M FAITHFUL TO HER AND SHE WENT INTO HEART FAILURE. AFTER DELIVERING MY TWINS. AND I'M I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD EVER SEE HER ALIVE AGAIN I READ FOR IRAN FOR RED LIGHTS TRYING TO GET TO HER HOPING I WOULD SEE HER ALIVE AGAIN. SHE'S THE WOMAN I LOVE AND ASKING MY HELD HER HAND AS SHE MISCARRIED OUR FIRST CHILD. SHE IS MY MOST PRECIOUS GIFT. AND TWENTY NINE FORTY THREE WOULD HAVE STOLEN THIS RICH LIFE FROM ME. AND IT WOULD LEAVE THE MANY OTHERS LIKE ME. WHO ARE HURTING FINDING NO BOOKS NO RESOURCES NO THERAPY? UP SOME DO YOU WANT TO LIVE OUT THEIR SAME SEX DESIRES AND THAT IS THEIR RIGHT. BUT NOT EVERYONE WHO FINDS HIMSELF A SAME SEXES TIRES IS WANTING. TO PURSUE THAT IS IS AT PEACE WITH THAT. AND SO I'M NOT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY ANYONE WOULD WANT TO TAKE AWAY. THE RIGHTS ARE MY PEOPLE GROUP WITCHES PEOPLE FINDING THEMSELVES WITH THIS IRISH THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE CHANGE. PEOPLE'S BRAINS CAN CHANGE ITS NEUROPLASTICITY. AND WHY WOULD WE TELL PEOPLE THAT THAT THERE WHY WOULD BY WAITING UNTIL PEOPLE LIKE ME THAT I DON'T EXIST OR THAT MY DESIRE TO LIVE AUTHENTICALLY IS FRAUDULENT. WHAT RIGHT DOES GOVERNMENT HAVE TO TELL ME HOW I HAVE TO IDENTIFY SEXUALLY? SO AYE OPPOSED AB TWENTY NINE FORTY THREE BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT'S A VIOLATION OF OUR FREE SPEECH AND ALSO PEOPLE'S RIGHTS TO LIFE LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. THAT'S WHAT. MY NAME IS ELIZABETH WANTING. SIR I AM COMING UP AT THE LAST MINUTE SOME SPEAKING TO YOU ALL COMPLETELY SPONTANEOUSLY HAVEN'T HAD ANY TIME TO PREPARE. I'M I GREW UP BELIEVING THAT I WAS. WELL I WHAT DIDN'T FIT IN WITH THE GIRLS I DIDN'T ACCEPT MY LIFE IS A GIRL IDENTIFIED AS A I HAD MY FIRST RELATIONSHIP WITH A WOMAN HE BEGAN SIXTEEN. I CAME OUT IN MY EARLY TWENTIES I LIVED LOCALLY HERE IN MIDTOWN IN THE GAY COMMUNITY ALL THROUGH MY TWENTIES. I WANT TO SEMINARY IN A PRESBYTERIAN SEMINARY IN CHICAGO ILLINOIS. I'M OPENLY GAY I WAS ONE OF MAYBE SIX WHO WERE OPENLY OUT AND PROUD. WHEN I GRADUATED FROM SEMINARY I DID MINISTRY IN THE GAY COMMUNITY. BUT MY FACE JOURNEY LED ME OUT OF THAT LIFESTYLE. AS I PURSUED THE LORD I GAINED FREEDOM EVENTUALLY GOT MARRIED TO A MAN. AND I DO MINISTRY AMONG OTHER WOMEN WHO'VE HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCE AS ME. I'M I'M CONCERNED IS THAT THERE IS NOT ENOUGH REFLECTIVE SCIENTIFIC STUDY ON THE FLUIDITY OF SEXUALITY FOR WOMEN SPECIFICALLY. AND THAT THIS BILL. REALIZE THAT MANY WOMEN SEEK REFUGE FROM MISOGYNY AND SEXISM IN THE ARMS OF ANOTHER WOMAN. AND THIS BILL COULD HINDER THAT EXPERIENCE OF FREEDOM AND HEALTH. WHOLENESS TO WOMEN. PLEASE OPPOSE THIS. MANY OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. GIVE YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE. I'M MY NAME IS REYES SOLOMON AND. THIS BILL I OPPOSE BECAUSE IT'S INTOLERANT. OF MY RIGHT TO LIVE. AS A EX GAY MAN. A. AND ALSO IT TAKES AWAY MY RIGHT TO THERAPY TO HAVE A FREE PSYCHOLOGICAL SPACE. IT'S NOT JUST CONVERSION THERAPY THAT THIS BILL GOES AGAINST IT GOES AGAINST ALL OF THERAPY. NOT REALLY IT RUINS THE THE. THE THERAPEUTIC FRAME A HOME. CLINICALLY SO THANK YOU. CARL CALMLY WITH HIS MINISTRIES IN FOLSOM. AS A YOUNG MAN I STRUGGLE WITH SAME SEX ATTRACTIONS AND THEY WERE UNWANTED. AND IT WAS THE RESOURCE OF THEIR WOULD BE IMPACTED BY THIS BILL THAT WERE VERY HELPFUL TO ME. AND PUT ME ON A DIFFERENT TRAJECTORY AND I'VE BEEN MARRIED FOR FORTY YEARS AND GOT FOUR CHILDREN VERY FULFILLED LIFE IN NINETEEN NINETY A STARTED MINISTRY. AT AND WE WEREN'T OUT THERE ADVERTISING BUT I HAD I'VE HAD OVER THE YEARS HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE. THAT USE THE SAME KINDS OF RESOURCES THAT HAVE MADE A HUGE IMPACT ON THEIR LIVES AND SO. AYE AYE AYE VOTE I WOULD URGE YOU TO VOTE NO SO THAT WE CAN HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY THOSE THAT ARE LOOKING FOR.

THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. XENA BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THE MOTION IS TO PASS. IS RIGHT. JUST WANT TO. BE SURE THAT WE HAVE SOME CLARIFICATION. THE BILL DOES NOT. PROHIBIT. COUNSELING. WITH A PSYCHOTHERAPIST OF SOMEBODY HAS ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR SEXUALITY IS ARE CORRECT THE CORRECT. SO THEY CAN GO AND RECEIVE THEM FROM THE THE ANALYSIS. ACCEPTANCE SUPPORT UNDERSTANDING. OF FACILITATION OF. EXPLORING THEIR SEXUALITY IS THAT CORRECT CORRECT AND IS THERE ANYTHING IN THIS BILL THAT WOULD PROHIBIT. A PRIEST A PASTOR RABBI FROM. SPEAKING WITH ONE OF THE PRISONERS ONE OF THEIR MEMBERS ABOUT ISSUES REGARDING THEIR SEXUALITY. NO. THAT ONE OF THAT ONE OF THE GENTLEMEN THAT. SPOKE. PART OF A GROUP CALLED NEW BORN PERFECT. I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THAT IS A VERY APPROPRIATE NAME. I LIKE THAT. AND. THE COMMENTS MADE ALSO ABOUT THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AMERICAN AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION THEY HAVE TAKEN A POSITION ON THIS. AND THEY AGREE THAT. THE CONVERSION THERAPY AND PARENT OF THERAPY. ARE. THERE AGAINST. THOSE THEIR PRIEST ZACHARIAS. VERY GOOD THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER KALRA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU SOME AREAS FOR SOME OF THOSE CLARIFICATIONS AND AND I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE UP. ON BOTH SIDESI CAME FOR THAT REVEALED SOME VERY PERSONAL. ASPECTS OF YOUR LIFE AND THAT'S NEVER EASY AND IT TAKES A LOT OF COURAGE TO DO THAT. I'M A AS A NOT SO FOLLOW UP UP ON ON A SUMMARY RAISES. QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS. THIS DOES NOT STOP ANYONE FROM. THE SEEKING THERAPY IN FACT THEIR A WIDE RANGE OF REASONS WHY YOUNG PEOPLE SHOULD SEEK THERAPY FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS I THINK THAT THAT WE TALK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME COUNSELING IN SCHOOLS MAKING SURE THAT. OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE CARED FOR. AYE AND THAT DOESN'T STOP IN ADULTHOOD. I THINK AN ADULT IT ALSO AND AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT. THAT. THIS IS REALLY. IN MY ESTIMATION WHAT A CONSUMER FRAUD ISSUE BECAUSE. I BELIEVE THAT. THERE'S PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY FOR APPROPRIATE COUNTS AS PLAY OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO YOUR FAITH BASED. ORGANIZATION. TO SEEK THE SUPPORT YOU NEED. HOWEVER. THERAPIES THAT. START HERB OF THE HAVE THE PROMISE. THAT SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY IS A CHOICE. AS PART OF THAT THERAPY. I THINK THAT'S FOR THE FRIED LA ASPECT COMES IN PARTICULARLY WHEN NOT ONLY THE INDIVIDUAL. THAT IS GOING THROUGH THAT DIFFICULT TIME IN TRYING TO AB BUBBA I INTEND TO COME TO THEIR OWN IDENTITY. BUT THE FAMILIES ARE AS WELL AND I THINK VALUES ARE BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF. UP DURING A DIFFICULT TIME AND I THINK THAT THE ACCESS AS STATED IN THE REPORT THAT THIS OF. THAT IT DOESN'T INCLUDE THERAPIES PROVIDE ACCEPTANCE SUPPORT UNDERSTANDING OF CLIENTS AND WHAT HAVE YOU. THAT ALSO PLAYS THE FAMILIES. YOU KNOW THAT THEY SHOULD ALSO BE SEEKING THE KINDS OF THERAPIES THAT ALLOW FOR. OF THE RELATIONSHIP TO BE A LOVING RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM IN THEIR LOVED ONE SO THAT EVERYONE GETS A SUPPORT THEY NEED AND I THINK THAT THIS BILL. ABSOLUTELY STILL ALLOWS FOR THAT AND I WANNA. THANK YOU AUTHOR FOR HIS COURAGE. FORWARD. AND FOR HIS CONTINUED EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A LOVING COMMUNITY. THANK YOU YOU DO THIS AS WELL IS WITHOUT BE PROHIBITED IF THE RETREAT DEALT WITH. ISSUES OF OF SEXUALITY. GOOD MORNING I ANTHONY SAMPSON. WITH ARNOLD AND PORTER SO BECAUSE THIS. THIS IS. DIFFERENT THAN THAT TED LIU BILL THAT WE SAW A SB ELEVEN SEVENTY TWO. WHICH WAS IN THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE WHICH ARE CREATED THAT'S OUT RIGHT BAN FOR FOR MINORS FOR PURPOSES OF OF OF. THE SEXUAL ORIENTATION CHANGE EFFORTS THIS FALLS UNDER THE CONSUMER LEGAL REMEDIES ACT SO IN THE SITUATION YOU PROVIDED THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE THAT UNDERLYING TRANSACTION TO HAVE OCCURRED. SO SO TO GO TO THAT RETREAT FIRST THAT THRESHOLD ISSUE OF AND WHAT THEIR PAYMENT RIGHT. AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION IS WOULD WOULD YOU NOTE THAT THE DEFINITION IN THE BILL PERTAINS TO PRACTICES SO WHAT THAT. THAT CONFERENCE WHERE AN INDIVIDUALS WERE SPEAKING WITH THAT BE THERE WHAT WOULD THEY BE PRACTICING. I'M AND THEN OF COURSE THERE IS THIS LINE BETWEEN WHEN YOU ENTER INTO THIS WORLD OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION CHANGE EFFORTS WHICH IS CLEARLY DEFINED IN THE BILL AND WE'VE SEEN COURTS UPHELD UPHOLD. THAT LANGUAGE WHEN YOU SORT OF CROSS THAT LINE INTO CHICKEN TO SEEKING TO CHANGE ONE'S SEXUAL ORIENTATION. I THINK AT THAT AT CONFERENCES WHERE WHERE INDIVIDUALS ARE JUST SPEAKING ABOUT ABOUT SEXUAL ORIENTATION CHANGE EFFORTS AND THE FACT THAT THAT THAT THIS EXISTS AND GIVE THEIR OPINIONS ON IT AND BEING VERY SUPPORTIVE OF IT. THAT'S JUST THEM EXERCISING THEIR FREE SPEECH RIGHTS IT'S THE MOMENT THE ACROSS INTO THAT TERRITORY AND YOU ARE SEEKING TO CHANGE. THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION WHERE AGAIN. THAT'S WHERE YOU SORT ACROSS THE THRESHOLD IN THIS BILL. BUT AGAIN THE ISSUE AGAIN WOULD COME A YOU'D HAVE TO. YOU KNOW ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS BEFORE YOU EVEN GET THERE WHICH IS HAS THAT TRANSACTION OCCURRED. WAS THAT TRANSACTION SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF ATTENDING A CONFERENCE THAT'S YOU KNOW SOLE FOCUS WAS ON SEXUAL ORIENTATION CHANGE EFFORTS. YOU KNOW ARE THERE. MULTIPLE SECTIONS ON MULTIPLE DIFFERENT ISSUES. AND AGAIN WAS WAS WITH THAT THEM ACTUALLY PRACTICING. THE. YOU KNOW THE. BECAUSE THAT THE TERM AND THE BILL'S PRACTICING AND SO WHETHER THAT CONSTITUTES A PRACTICE. IN A CONFERENCE SETTING VERSUS PRACTICING WITHIN A CHURCH ARE WITHIN US IN A MEDICAL FACILITY. I THINK I'M NOT CLEAR YEAH ACTUALLY CAUSED ME. MUCH CONCERNED. SO. SOME CATHOLIC WE I DON'T KNOW WHAT A TICKET YOU WILL WE HAVE OUR OWN BASIS RIGHT SO YOU GO ON A RETREAT WITH THE CHURCH. RIGHT IF YOU WANNA GET MARRIED OR. COUPLES RETREATS SIRS. CHURCH THE CHURCH. MAY BRING PEOPLE AND. WHAT THE CHURCH UNDER THIS BILL STOLE? IF YOU'RE PAYING SIMPLY FOR YOUR STATE OVERNIGHT STAY. AND THE CHURCH HAS A PROGRAM BY WHICH PEOPLE ARE VOLUNTARILY ENTERING AND WANT. WILL MAKE IT AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE. THE CHURCH. BRING SOMEBODY IN WHO WHO DOES IN FACT. SIT AROUND A CAMPFIRE IN PRE. FOR YOUR CHANGE. A SEXUAL ORIENTATION. WOULD THAT BE ILLEGAL UNDER THE SPELL. LIKELY NOT BECAUSE IF YOU THAT PAYMENT IS FOR THE OVERNIGHT STAY AND THE SERVICES ARE BEING OFFERED. TO THE PARTICIPANTS AT NO COST THEN. THIS BILL WOULD NOT APPLY. SO THAT TIED THE LEAVE BILL THAT WE SAW WAS AGAIN JUST A POT RIGHT PROHIBITION WHERE IS THIS YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR THE ACT FOR THE SERVICES BEING RENDERED. JUST GOT APPROPRIATIONS. RIGHT I AM. I'M NOT SURE I FULLY UNDERSTAND OR FEEL FULLY COMFORTABLE I I DO THINK. I'M I'M. COMFORTABLE WITH THIS IDEA OR TALK ABOUT BUSINESS PARK THIS ISN'T AND THIS IS FOR FRAUDULENT. I'M GETTING CONCERNED WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. REACH HER IT WOULD. KNOWING ONCE A NORMAL BECAUSE THAT IT COULD SPAN. A WIDE VARIETY OF RELIGIOUS SECT. THAT I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO ITEM. BUT I I I CAN'T IMAGINE WE'RE TRYING TO. TO STEP THERE. THAT THAT CREATES ADDITIONAL PROM SO I JUST WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE WORK WITH OFFER THIRDS OFFICE JUST TO ENSURE THAT. WE CAN EXPLORE ALL THE POSSIBILITIES OF HOW THIS COULD BE OUT. PROHIBITING. A RELIGIOUS INSTITUTION FROM PRACTICING THEIR RELIGION BASICALLY WHAT WEATHER WE BELIEVE THAT TO BE VALID OR TRUE ARE GOOD. WHICH I PERSONALLY DON'T. THINK THAT. BUT BAD. I I THINK. WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL THAT'S ALSO IF IF THE AUTHOR I'M GONNA OF COURSE SUPPORT US WITH OFF THEIR IS WILLING SINCE YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME TO MY COMMITTEE. BUT WILLING TO COME TALK TO ME THROUGH THAT THAT. PROTECTIONS FOR UP NORMAL. RELIGIOUS ACTED. THE QUESTION ON THE. XENA MISSILE YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WITH RESPECT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT THIS SPECIFICALLY IS VERY NARROW IN SCOPE UNDER THE. FOCUSED ON THIS TRANSACTIONS A UNDER THE CONSUMER LEGAL REMEDIES ACT AND WILL STILL STAY COMMITTED AND WILL STATE THAT IT IS NOT THE INTENT A TO GO AFTER. OF RELIGION OR TWO CHURCHES BUT RATHER THIS FRAUDULENT PRACTICE ITSELF. ENDS OF REWRITING THAT THAT THAT NOTION. IN THE PREVIOUS CONVERSATION AS IT AS PASSED THE CONSUMER PROTECTION AND PRIVACY COMMITTEE WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT THIS WITH SIMILAR CONVERSATION. OF THAT SO ONE OF OUR OTHER FELLOW COLLEAGUES WHO WAS AN ATTORNEY. HERSELF ALSO RAISED. BUT THAT A SHE WAS SATISFIED WITH THAT CONVERSATION A WITH RESPECT TO THIS BEEN VERY NARROW IN SCOPE ARE ON THESE TRANSACTIONS I FINALLY JUST IT HIT TO THE NOTION OF WHAT THEY'D. IF THIS CONCEPT OF CONVERSION THERAPY. THIS BILL IS AN LGBT CAUCUS PRIORITY OF ALL EIGHTY LGBT LEGISLATORS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THIS NOTION OF CONVERSION THERAPY IN ITSELF AS IF THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG. THEN THERE'S SOMETHING HARDLY WRONG. SO ASIDE FROM FACT YES WE ARE IN ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE TO TALK ABOUT THE SPECIFICS AND I HOPEFULLY I FEEL THAT WE HAVE ADDRESSED THOSE CONCERNS BUT THIS NOTION OF CONVERSION THERAPY THAT. WE'RE SOMEHOW THERE'S SOMETHING INHERENTLY WRONG WITH US. IS ANTI FEDERAL CALL TO MY EXISTENCE AND TO OUR COLLEAGUES EXISTENCE SIMPLY AS YOU ASK YOURSELF THAT SAME QUESTION CAN YOU BE CONVERTED FROM WHATEVER YOUR SEXUAL ORIENTATION IS OR YOUR. IDENTITY IS. AND I WOULD SUGGEST YOU THAT THE ANSWER IS NO AND THAT I AM EQUALLY. PROUD OF HOW YOU WERE BORN I AM EQUALLY AS PROUD AS YOU STAND. WE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HOPE. TO DEMONSTRATE THAT WE ARE STATE OF INCLUSION VERSUS EXCLUSION. AND THAT YOU WHICH IS JUST SIMPLY WITH LOVE A AND SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE. IN SUPPORTING AND LEADING WITH FLUFF. THANK YOU.

PRESENTING IS RACIAL CALL NOT HANDED OVER HER. LL. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME MY NAME'S ROCHELLE WILL THEN I AM OBVIOUSLY. PERSON WITH A DISABILITY BUT I AM ALSO EIGHT EIGHTY DEFENSE TURNING. I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE MAIN CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION ABOUT AB THIRTY ONE FIFTY EIGHT. THE FIRST IS THE SPECIAL PROCEDURAL OBSTACLES. EIGHT ME OR THIRTY ONE FIFTY EIGHT WHAT MERELY MIRROR OR ECHO LAWS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN ENACTED BEFORE IT SUCH AS THE GOVERNMENT TORT CLAIMS ACT WHERE YOU NEED. A GOVERNMENT TORT CLAIM FILED BEFORE YOU CAN BRING A LAWSUIT OR THE D. FE HR EEOC WHERE YOU NEED TO ATTAIN A RIGHT TO SUE LETTER. BEFORE YOU CAN FILE A LAWSUIT. THIS BILL WOULD ESSENTIALLY BE DOING THE SAME THING BUT INSTEAD OF WORKING WITH THE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES SINCE THERE'S NO AGENCY OF ENFORCEMENT. HE WOULD BE GIVING THAT NOTICE TO A BUSINESS OWNER FIRST AND FOREMOST. THE SECOND POINT I WOULD LIKE TO BRING ITS YOUR ATTENTION IS. THE ARGUMENT THAT HUNDREDS OF POTENTIAL OF A MAXIMUM OF A HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAYS IS UNREASONABLE. THAT LET ME JUST BREAKDOWN KIND OF THE TIMELINE OF HOW THESE CASES TRULY DO WORK AS SOMEBODY WHO'S DEFEND IT ALMOST A HUNDRED OF THESE LAWSUITS. THE FIRST IS THAT IT CAN TAKE UP TO THREE WEEKS JUST TO GET A CAST REPORT. THAT'S JUST ENOUGH TIME TO. HAVE THE BUSINESS OWNER OBTAINING CAST CONSTRUCTION GET THE REPORT AND THEN DIGEST WHAT THAT ACTUALLY MEANS THE SECOND STEP IS REALLY. IF YOU NEED TO HIRE THE EXPERTISE OF A CONTRACTOR. THAT CAN TAKE UP TO A MONTH JUST AND NOT AND OF ITSELF RIGHT THERE SU RD EATEN THE FIFTY ONE OUT OF THE INITIAL NINETY DAYS THAT YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN. THEN IF YOU NEED AN ARCHITECT OR AN ENGINEER TO REINFORCE WALLS OR COMPLETELY MODIFY ALL OF YOUR RESTAURANT BOOTHS OR. COMPLETELY REDO YOUR PARKING LOT THOSE DRAWINGS CAN TAKE CERTAINLY UP TO A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE DAYS HAS. IN ADDITION TO THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT IT WILL TAKE TO PULL PERMIT. WHICH CAN TAKE UP TO SIX MONTHS SO THIS IS A VERY REALISTIC VERY CONSERVATIVE. PERIOD OF TIME TO ENGAGE IN THE INTERACTIVE PROCESS WITH BUSINESS OWNERS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR COMPLAINT IS A PERSON WITH DISABILITY HAS BEEN HEARD. AS WELL AS GIVING THE POWER BACK TO THE BUSINESS OWNERS SAY HEY HEY LET'S WORK ON THIS TOGETHER HOW CAN I HELP YOU. THE THIRD POINT IS WHETHER THIS BILL WOULD INVITE FRAUD AND STUFF AND. THERE ARE SEVERAL LAW FIRMS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO ARE ALREADY ABUSING THIS LAW. THE REASON WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT TO COMBAT THE IN THIS PROCEDURAL ASPECT IS TRULY TO GIVE. HOW ARE BACK TO BUSINESSES AND THE PERSON WITH DISABILITY TO ENGAGE IN A CONVERSATION? TO PROVIDE THAT NOTICE OF HEY THIS IS WHAT I EXPERIENCE HOW CAN I HOW CAN I HELP YOU MAKE THIS BETTER FOR EVERYBODY ELSE THAT COMES IN THE DOOR BEHIND YOU. AND SO WHILE OUT OF THIS SEVENTEEN HIGHER LAWSUITS FILED IN STATE COURT SIX IRON FORTY THREE OF THOSE. WERE. HEARD ME OUT OF THE HUNDRED THE SEVENTEEN HUNDRED COMPLAINTS FILED WART SIX HUNDRED AND. FORTY THREE OF THOSE WERE FILED IN STATE COURT SO CLEARLY THEY'RE STILL. OUT A VERY LARGE AMOUNT OF COMPLAINTS BEING FILED HERE. THIS NUMBER IS FORTY FOURTEEN POINT TWO PERCENT HIGHER THAN IT WAS LAST YEAR WHICH IS I IN MY OPINION PRETTY ALARMING AND SEVENTY FOUR PERCENT OF THOSE LAWSUITS. OUT WERE FILED BY FOR LAW FIRMS. ABUSES ARE YOU TAKING PLACE. THE FOURTH POINT I'D LIKE TO BRING UP IS THAT. THAT THE ARGUMENT THAT IGNORANCE IS NOT A DEFENSE I'D LIKE TO POSE THIS QUESTION TO EACH MEMBER HERE. HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE A CPA TO HELP YOU WITH THE TAX CODE? YOU HAVE HELP FOR THAT. THE TAX CUT HAS BEEN ENACTED MUCH LONGERTHAN THE AMERICAN WITH DISABILITIES ACT AND YET. BUSINESSES ARE BEING FORCED TO KNOW EVERY SINGLE LAW IN THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT CONSTRUCTION WISE AND THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING CODES WITHOUT ANY HELP. THIS BILL GIVES THAT POWER BACK TO THE BUSINESS OF SAY HOW CAN I HELP YOU HOW CAN WORK TOGETHER AS A TEAM TO PROACTIVELY MAKE SURE THE BUSINESSES BECOME COMPLIANT WITH THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT AND THE CALIFORNIA ON IRAQ'S. SO THIS BILL STRIKES AN APPROPRIATE BALANCE SUCH AS PERSONS. BETWEEN OF MYSELF WHO ARE DISABLED PERSONS WHO NEED TO BE ABLE TO ENJOY ACCESS TO BUSINESSES. BUT THE FLIP SIDE OF IT IS IS ALSO STRIKE THE APPROPRIATE BALANCE FOR THE BUSINESS TO INVEST BACK INTO THEIR BUSINESS IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE LITIGATION. EXPENSE OF ATTORNEYS FEES. AND PARDON ME AND SETTLEMENT WHICH WILL INCREASE WHICH WILL OFFER YOU INCLUDE LITIGATION AND ATTORNEYS FEES SORT SURELY IS THE MOST ECONOMICAL WAY THAT THE PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES. THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE OPPOSITION. HAVE ON OUR HOUSING WITH THE CIVIL RIGHTS CALIFORNIA I'M WE ARE CROSS DISABILITY ORGANIZATION I JUST I'M I WANT TO MAKE A FEW POINTS TO ADDRESS THE COMMENT THAT THE WITNESS MADE. NUMBER ONE OF BUSINESS IS ONE OF THE PROACTIVE MICHIGAN A CAST INSPECTION PRIOR TO BEING SUIT. THAT'S THE OF THE FIRST MECHANISM TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING. SECOND OF ALL AND THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS OTHER AREAS OF LOT NO OTHER PROTECTED CLASS HAS TO GO THROUGH PROCEDURAL HERDERS HURDLES TO ADDRESS THEIR RIGHTS. NO ONE WOULD SAY TO A PERSON WHO IS AFRICAN AMERICAN OR WOMAN THAT YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THESE HURDLES BEFORE YOU CAN ASSERT WHAT YOUR RIGHTS ARE. SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT I ADDRESS THOSE PIECES LITIGATION IS THE ONLY WAY THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES CAN ENFORCE OUR RIGHTS THERE ARE NO PRIVATE INSPECTORS THAT GO AROUND OTHER THAN A CAST. IF A BUSINESS IS PROACTIVE TO ENSURE THAT OUR. ENVIRONMENT IS ACCEPTABLE PARTY'S SO I I YOU KNOW I EXTRA LITTLE BIT WITH THE COMMENTS THAT ARE THAT ARE BEING MADE IF BUSINESSES WANT TO BE PROACTIVE THEY SHOULD DO THAT BEFORE THE BEEN SUED THE STUBBLE RIGHTS LAWS HAVE BEEN ON THE BOOKS. FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND AND THEY SHOULD MAKE THEMSELVES AWARE OF THOSE THEY SHOULD HIRE ATTORNEYS AT THE CONFUSED THIS IS PART OF DOING BUSINESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND. IN THE NATION IF YOUR INCOME ENGAGE IN BUSINESS YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU LOOK AT THOSE ASPECTS OF OF BUSINESS ON. ACTIVITIES SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE WE ADDRESS THOSE. THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL CIVIL RIGHTS LAW FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF REFORM THROUGH THE LAST FEW YEARS THERE'S NO INDICATION THAT MORE TIME IS NEEDED. IF WE LOOK BACK AT THE ROTH BILL WHICH WHILE WE OPPOSED DID THEM INSTALL. UP TO HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES ARE AMONG THE CAST INSPECTION WAS DONE IN ADVANCE. THERE'S NO NEED FOR ANY ADDITIONAL REFORM AND AND WITH THOSE COMMENTS I'M GOING TO CLOSE AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE BUT AS I SAID THERE'S A BILL A LOT OF REFORM ON THE BOOKS. THERE'S NO INDICATION THAT WE NEED ADDITIONAL REFORM AND MANY OF THESE ACCESS ISSUES ARE VERY EASY TO FIX THEY'RE NOT COMPLICATED THERE'S THIS THERE ARE SIMPLE AS FOR EXAMPLE. YOU KNOW BUT IF YOU BLOCK YOUR ACCESSIBLE STALL WITH TOILET PAPER UNIQUE TO MOVE THAT YOU DON'T USE YOUR ACCESSIBLE STALL FOR STORAGE YOU DON'T BLOCK THE ACCESSIBLE BATHROOM WITH FOR EXAMPLE HIGH CHAIRS SO THE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES CAN'T ACCESS THOSE. THOSE AREAS SO VERY BASIC FIXES AND IN MANY OF THESE CASES NOT ALL OF THEM BUT AS I SAID IN IN A LOT OF INSTANCES THE LAWS HAVE BEEN CHANGED TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. SO I I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THE COMMENTS OF THE WITNESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS RUTHIE GOLD CORN I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIANS FOR DISABILITY RIGHTS WHO SPEAKS ON BEHALF OF SEVENTEEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS WITH DISABILITIES. ONCE AGAIN WE ARE MAKING EFFORTS TO COME TO YOU TOO AGAIN VIGOROUSLY OPPOSE YET ANOTHER ATTEMPT. TO PUNISH THE SEVENTEEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO DISABILITIES BY INFRINGING UPON OUR CIVIL RIGHTS PUTTING MORE BARRIERS IN OUR PATH. TO BUSINESSES BECAUSE THE BILLS WHICH HAVE IN EVERYTHING IN COMMON WITH THE PREVIOUS ONES BUSINESSES ARE GIVEN A PASS TO COMPLIANCE. SIXTEEN NO WAY ELEVEN EIGHTY SIX TO SIXTY NINE WENT AS FAR AS WE WILL ALLOW AS IS YOU WILL ALLOW. TO INFRINGE ON OUR RIGHT TO FREE AND EQUAL ACCESS TO BE CONSUMERS SPEND OUR MONEY AND SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITIES. THIS IS A SOLUTION LOOKING FOR A PROBLEM THE PROBLEM THAT WAS ADDRESSED WITH SOLUTIONS THAT WE ALLOWED BECAUSE LAW. AS AS AS WRITTEN AND THE BILLS THAT PREVIOUSLY CAME FORWARD WE WERE FORCED TO CAPE. TIME AND TIME AGAIN. WE DO NOT HAVE A PROBLEM. AND WE THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY ARE NOT THE PROBLEM. BUSINESSES HAVE A PROBLEM. IF YOU DO NOT INTUITIVELY UNDERSTAND THAT IF YOU DO NOT HAVE AN ACCESSIBLE PARKING SPACE. AND A PATH OF TRAVEL INTO YOUR BUSINESS YOU ARE IN VIOLATION OF THE LAW HOW CAN YOU NOT KNOW THAT. HOW BECAUSE AS A SMALL BUSINESS? I JUST OPENED IN A STRIP MALL. IT'S NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT PARKING LOT TO BE COMPLIANT. IT IS THE PROPERTY OWNER BUT I'M THE ONE IT'S GOING TO BEAR THAT RESPONSIBLY BECAUSE THE LAW IT READS THAT WAY. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD TO GET OUT LAWS IN PLACE AND BILLS WRITTEN THAT THE ROAD THE RESPONSIBILITY WHERE IT BELONGS. ON MUNICIPALITIES. BUILDING OFFICIALS INFORMATION ON CAST PROGRAMS AND AVAILABILITIES AND NOT LETTING. COLDWELL BANKER AND THEY'RE LIKE OFF THE HOOK FOR THEIR COMMERCIAL SHOPPING CENTERS. THIS BILL DOES NOT SOLVE A PROBLEM. A PROBLEM HAS BEEN AGGRESSIVE AT BEEN ADDRESSED IN SIXTEEN OH EIGHT. ELEVEN EIGHTY SIX. AND TO SIXTY NINE AND WE ARE DONE BEING TOLD THAT IT IS OUR JOB TO TELL YOU WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS. HIRE AN EXPERT. OR HIGHER ONE OF US AND WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO TELL YOU WE DO NOT VOLUNTEER. WE WANT TO GIVE YOU ARE MONEY YOU WHAT THE DEAD PRESIDENTS IN MY WALLET. I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO GIVE IT TO YOU LET MY PEOPLE IN. THANK YOU MY NAME IS JEFF TARGET HERE. I'M AN ADVOCATE. I'M I AM HERE BECAUSE IS I'VE DIRECTED LAST YEAR TO. MR OUTLIERS THAT IT IS THE BILL DE IN OWNERS. THEY HAVE NOT FOR TWENTY YEARS CORRECTED. PROBLEMS WITH THEIR BUILDINGS. HERE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY LIKE IN SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY WE ARE WORKING AT SEEING THAT A BETTER CHECK LIST GETS THERE SO THAT THE. BILL DO YOU KNOW OUR AND BUSINESS OWNERS UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY NEED TO DO I'VE ASSUMING YOU ARE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE. EXPRESSION OF CASH MEANS EVADED SPECTER THAT KNOWS AND UNDERSTANDS THE DISABILITY LAWS. AYE ECHOED THE THINGS THAT YOU'VE HEARD BEFORE. I AM HERE IN VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTING AS YOU MAY SEE I AM WEARING CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE OF RETIRED AMERICANS. WE HAVE AN ISSUE THAT THE SUPREME TO LEAVE THAT SOLE RIGHTS AND PROTECTED. AND THAT THESE ARE ISSUES THAT MORE MORE SENIORS ARE ALSO HAVING TO. DEAL WITH OF ACCESSIBILITY. I ALSO DOOR WITH A SLAM A DOG FIGHTER SO YOU DOGGEDLY SEE ME COMING IN HERE AND SAYING TO YOU GUYS YOU NEED TO DO BETTER LOS. AND IT'S PLEASE THINK ABOUT THIS I KNOW THERE IS AN ISSUE BUT CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN FAR BETTER AT DEALING WITH FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS. BEEN PRETTY MUCH ANY OTHER STATE SO PLEASE TAKE THE LEAD. DON'T GET CAUGHT UP WITH SAYING THAT. BECAUSE THIS IS OCCURRING THIS IS A WAY BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THIS IS GOING TO PROVIDE ANY BETTER SOLUTION. RIGHT NOW GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS KEVIN BACK AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF CALIFORNIA POSED FOR THE REASONS STATED IN THE COMMITTEES TEXANS ANALYSIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SITTING ATTACK OR THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIANS STRONG OPPOSITION. THANK YOU CAN LOOK IF YOU. A FUNNY ARNOLD THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME TESTIFY I HAVE THESE LETTERS I'M TURNING INTO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL THIS BILL IS JUST ANOTHER A ENTANGLEMENT OF OUR CIVIL RIGHTS TO BE ABLE TO EXERCISE AND HAVE ACCESS TO BUILDINGS. AND ALL OF THIS IS ALREADY OCCURRED TO MAKE THINGS EASIER AND MORE ACCEPTABLE TO BUSINESSES. GENERALLY SPEAKING A IN IN MANY ATTORNEYS JUST WRITE THE LETTER AND SEE IF YOU CAN SETTLE OUTSIDE. OF COURT BUT A LOT OF THE BUSINESSES DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. AND. JUST AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE LACK OF ACCESSIBILITY. I HAVE A FRIEND WHO'S A SENIOR WHO JUST BECAME DISABLED WHO HAS A COLOSTOMY BAG NOW. BECAUSE SHE ALMOST DIED. SHE'S IN A NURSING HOME. IN THE COMMUNITY I LIVE IN I LIVE IN ELK GROVE. AND IT'S A REHAB FACILITY. NOT ONE ACCESSIBLE. FACILITY BATHROOM IN THAT WHOLE PLACE. NOT ONE WHAT YEAR IS THIS. TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THESE LAWS WERE PUT ON THE BOOKS. THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT. WAS PUT ON THE BOOKS IN NINETEEN NINETY ENTITLED TWENTY FOUR WAS PUT ON THE BOOKS. I BELIEVE IT WAS JUNE OF NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE. SO THESE BUSINESSES COME BACK EVERY YEAR JUST GREEN THAT THEY NEED HELP THAT WERE SO TERRIBLE THE DISABLED PEOPLE. WHY IS THIS THAT'S BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT REMOVING THEIR BARRIERS? THEY KNOW THAT YOU ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE STANDING IN A COURT OF LAW. TO ADDRESS THE BARRIERS MANY PEOPLE DON'T EVEN ASSERT THEIR CIVIL RIGHTS TO REMOVE THE BARRIERS. AND. THIS BILL IS JUST ANOTHER HURDLE TO TELL PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES THEY MUST SEND A CERTIFIED LETTER. AFTER THEY'VE BEEN DISCRIMINATED AGAINST. BY A BUSINESS WHO HAS NOT REMOVE THEIR BARRIERS. AND. YOU IT REQUIRES A CERTAIN LEVEL EXPERTISE IT REQUIRES KNOWLEDGE. AND ACCESS CODES AND WHAT IS REQUIRED IT REQUIRES THAT A PERSON BE A EDUCATED. AND. IT AND IT COST MANY PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE A LOT OF INCOME MONEY TO TELL THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT ACCESSIBLE. AND. GIVES THEM TIME TO REMOVE BARRIERS WHICH ARE WAY PAST OVERDUE IN BEING REMOVED. SO IT'S ANOTHER OBSCENE BILL AND JUST DID TO LET YOU KNOW. THE PEOPLE THAT WERE SUPPORTING THIS BILL. AND I I WANT TO TELL YOU WHY THEY'RE SUPPORTING THIS BILL BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY HAVE ACCESS BARRIERS. CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA GROCERS ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT OIL MARKETERS ASSOCIATION AND CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. NOW LET ME TELL YOU WHO OPPOSES THIS BILL. A ACLU OF CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR NURSING HOME REFORM CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIANS FOR DISABILITY RIGHTS. CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA ONE INDIVIDUAL AND I GUESS THAT WOULD BE TOO BECAUSE I JUST TURNED IN MY LETTER TODAY. CONNIE ALL LONG TERM DISABILITY RIGHTS ADVOCATE THIRTY YEARS ADVOCATING FOR ACCESS FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES NOT ONLY BEFORE COMMITTEES SUCH AS THIS BUT BEFORE THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING STANDARDS COMMISSION. AND TESTIFYING WHAT ACCESS CODES ARE NEEDED AND EVERYTHING IS GETTING HARDER AND HARDER FOR PEOPLE IT'S GETTING HARDER AND HARDER FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND I LEARN SOMETHING NEW. FROM MY FRIEND WHO NOW HAS A COLOSTOMY BAG. BECAUSE A. THERE ARE KNOW TOILET FACILITIES REALLY FOR PEOPLE WITH COLOSTOMY BAGS. SO ALTHOUGH WE ADVOCATED AND SOME YOUNG ADVOCATES PASSED THE ADULT CHANGING TABLES FACILITIES. A BILL AND UNDER BONY OF. A YEAR TO GO. AND WE'RE WORKING ON GETTING ACTUAL CODES FOR AMUSEMENT PARKS AND LARGER VENUES. IF YOU END UP WITH A SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE A COLOSTOMY BAG. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO DEAL WITH THAT THEY HAVE TO EMPTY. AND. MS ANOTHER AREA THAT YOU LIVE UP PLEASE THAT NEEDS ADVOCACY. SO I AM DEFINITELY FOR ALL THE. PREVIOUS SPEAKERS REASONS OPPOSED TO THIS BILL IN ASKING YOU TO OPPOSE THIS BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU AND DON'T BRING ANY MORE THESE OBSCENE BILLS BACK. THANK YOU. WE DO HAVE SOME MORE PEOPLE. SPEAK WE'VE HAD SEVERAL SUBSTANTIVE ALREADY IF WE COULD BE BRIEFLY. YEAH MY NAME IS JOSEPH VERY HOME THAT LIKE THE PRESIDENT OF THIS REALLY ORGANIZED GROUP FOR INITIATED TOTALLY QUALITY. OTHERWISE KNOWN AS DOGFIGHT. AND WE STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS BILL. THANK YOU. CINDY THREAT TO THE STATE COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES WE SUPPORT WHAT OUR COLLEAGUES FROM DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA HAS STATED NO OTHER CLASS IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE NOTICE BEFORE THEY SEE YOU UNDER THEIR CIVIL RIGHTS. AND PEOPLE DISABILITY SHOULD ALSO NOT BE ABLE TO BE STRONGLY OPPOSE THE SPELL THANK YOU THANK YOU. MY NAME IS TARA CHERRY. I WAS ONE OF THE ORIGINAL MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF THE PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED. AND WE WERE THE ONES WHO PASSED THE ORIGINAL BILLS IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE RIVER CUTTING EDGE. AND THOSE BILLS. WENT ON TO BECOME THE BASIS FOR THE AMERICAN DISABILITIES ACT SO I WOULD AT THIS A LONG TIME I'M EIGHTY THREE. AND I'VE BEEN AT THIS FOR MORE THAN FORTY YEARS. WE DREAMED OF AND ACCESSIBLE SOCIETY BECAUSE MANY OF US WERE DENIED. EMPLOYMENT. WE WERE DENIED SCHOOL. WERE DENIED ALL KINDS OF THINGS. AND WE WORK TO BECOME CITIZENS. THE. BUT THERE WOULD FINALLY RECOGNIZED THAT WE WERE PEOPLE I WAS AMAZING. AND I GOT RIGHT. I GOTTA WRITE TEN EDUCATION I GOTTA RIGHT TO TRANSPORTATION I GOTTA WRITE. LIVE AS A HUMAN BEING AND AS A CITIZEN. IN ADDITION TO MY WHEELCHAIR I AM NOW ALMOST TOTALLY DEAF. WHICH AT MAKES LIFE EVEN MORE INTERESTING. I'M I WISH THAT YOU IN THIS CHAMBER AND HAD SOME CAPTIONING AND YOU DON'T. AND MOST OF THE HEARING ROOMS DON'T THE BIGGER ASSEMBLY ROOM SOME. THEY HAVE. SOME CLOSE CAPTIONING AND THEY HAVE SOME REAL TIME CAPTIONING. WE'VE DREAMED OF AN EGG SAYS WELL SOCIETY WHICH IS NOT ALL THAT DIFFERENT CALLED. RETRO FIT THIS EXPENSIVE. DESIGNING A BUILDING THAT OF SUCCESS SIMPLE TO BEGIN WITH IS AB. BREGENZ HAD WONDERFUL IDEA AND I WISH THE ALLEY DE PEOPLE. I'M SORRY THAT'S L. E. D. PEOPLE WERE DOING THAT AS A MATTER OF COURSE. I NEED TO POINT OUT SOMETHING THAT I SINCE I'M DEAF I DIDN'T HEAR A LOT OF WHAT WAS SAID BUT I DIDN'T SEE ANYBODY SLIPS. MENTIONING EMPLOYMENT. X.. THAT'S ABILITY IS GREAT IF YOU MADE THE GOODS AND SERVICES OF A BUSINESS. IF YOU NEED EMPLOYMENT YOU NEED ACCESS AND THAT'S IS VERY SELDOM EVER MENTION WHERE THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT ACCESS. ACCESS IS ALL THE CIVIL RIGHTS HAVE ONE OF THOSE IS THE RIGHT TO GET A JOB. DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN KEEP IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SURE CAN GET IT. AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT THIS KIND OF A BILL DOESN'T SHOW UP AGAIN. THAT WE PASSED A LAW AND MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS FOR TO YEARS THEIR BEEN LAWS FOR ACCESSIBILITY. AND I'M. BUSINESS OWNERS SHARE SAW SAYING OH GEE I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THAT THAT'S A LIE. AND IT'S A SERIOUS LIE AND IT'S IMPEDING THE LIVES OF MANY MANY PEOPLE. OUR MEDICAL CARE IS SO MUCH BETTER. WHEN I HAD POLIO IN NINETEEN FORTY FIVE WHICH IS BEFORE ANY IF YOU WERE BORN. THERE WAS VERY LITTLE. HELP. WE DON'T HAVE THAT DISEASE ANYMORE WE DON'T HAVE POLIO ANYMORE WE STILL GOT WHEELCHAIRS AND WE STILL NEED ACCESS. THIS BILL IS. STUPID THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT THING THAT I'M GOING TO BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. HERE WHERE GOD I'M A A OPPOSED TO THIS BILL I THINK THIS GOES MUCH FURTHER THAN WE'VE EVEN TALKED ABOUT. THE LAST TIME THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT A BILL IN THIS COMMITTEE WORK PRETTY HARD TO CREATE A FRAMEWORK I. HAVE HEARD THE CONCERNS ABOUT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF LAW FIRMS. THAT HAVE BEEN FILING THE SUITS BUT WE TRY TO BUILD SOME PROCESS AROUND THAT AND. AND GO AFTER THE. DOES HI. PROFILE FILERS BUT YET THE FACT REMAINS THAT. IT'S IT IT'S AGAINST THE LAW TO HAVE A FACILITY WITHOUT ACCESS. AND TO TURN THE TABLES WHICH IS WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO ON THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY IS IS. JUST UNFAIR AND AND FURTHERING AND UNFAIRNESS IN IN IN EQUITY FOR THEM. SO I I JUST CANNOT SUPPORT THIS BILL. SO MISSOURI. MISTER KILEY. THANK YOU PROMISED HER. BUT IT JUST AS A POINT OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE I DO WANT TO THANK RUTHIE FROM FOR COMING FROM THE INLAND EMPIRE. TO COME AND TESTIFY GREAT ADVOCATE FOR THE INLAND EMPIRE SUPPORT. COMMITTEE OF. DISABLED PERSONS AND I THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I THINK THAT. THE COMMENTS HAVE ALL BEEN MADE BUT I JUST WANTED TO. INCLUDE THAT IN A RECORD TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER KILEY. I THINK YOU ANSWERED YOUR AYE I DO HAVE A DIFFERENT TAKE ON ON THIS BILL. AND I DO WANT TO THANK ALL THE WITNESSES WHO CAME HERE TO TESTIFY BUT I. I'M NOT SURE IT'S HELPFUL TO CALL BILL STUPID AND OBSCENE I WENT BACK I THINK THIS IS REALLY A COMMON SENSE MEASURE. AND I'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE HOW WE'VE HAD BIPARTISAN ATTEMPTS FOR MR GRAY AND MR MATHIS BEFORE TO TRY TO GET WHAT EVELYN REALLY RECOGNIZES THE PROBLEM. AND I SEE THIS IS PUTTING ON THE ONE HAND. MILLIONS OF BUSINESS OWNERS AND MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS IN THE DISABLED COMMUNITY AGAINST ON THE OTHER HAND THOSE WHO PROFIT FROM THIS PREDATORY LUNATIC LITIGATION. AND THAT YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE THAT I CALIFORNIA THE DISABILITIES HAVE NOT ALWAYS GOTTEN THE PRIORITY THAT THEY SHOULD FROM THIS LEGISLATURE. BUT MR MATHIS HAS BEEN I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHAMPIONS ARE ON THIS AND. I SEVERAL OTHER MEASURES FOR CALIFORNIA'S WITH DISABILITIES SO I I THINK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS ABOUT THIS AND I I URGE YOU TO CONTINUE THE FIGHT. IF YOU OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SINGH NANDA SIR MATHIS YOU MIKLOS. MEMBERSHIP IN IN THOSE IN THE AUDIENCE I I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR. THE AND I WANT TO SHARE THE STORY ABOUT MY SON. HE WAS BORN WITH SPINA BIFIDA. OR ACTUALLY FACING ANOTHER SURGERY FOR HIM IN THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS. WIT WHICH HE MAY END UP PERMANENTLY IN A WHEELCHAIR. SO QUITE FRANKLY THE IDEA THAT IT WOULD BE TURNING THE TABLES ON MY OWN CHILD. I'M NOT OKAY WITH THAT. MY FAMILY IS PART OF THE DISABLED COMMUNITY WE ARE PART OF THE SEVENTEEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS WITH DISABILITIES. I WORK WITH THE FAMILIES AT HOME. WE TALK TO THEM WE HEAR THESE ISSUES. THE BILL BEFORE YOU ALL TODAY. IT'S SIMPLY ENSURING. THAT WE ARE BREAKING THE BARRIERS THAT WHEN ACCESS IS. BLOCK IS DENIED. THAT WE'D FIX IT. SO THAT THE NEXT PERSON COMING THROUGH THE DOOR. DOES IT HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT TRAGIC EVENT. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL ALL EVERYONE IN OUR COMMUNITY IS WORKING TOGETHER. I'M NOT TRYING TO DENY ACCESS TO ANYBODY ON TRYING TO ENSURE THAT ACCESS IS THERE. FOR THE NEXT PERSON IN LINE THAT WE ARE PAYING IT FORWARD. FOR EVERYBODY IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THAT WE ARE ENSURING. THAT THINGS GET FIX. FOR ME THIS ISN'T ABOUT LAWSUITS TO SUSAN ABOUT ANY OF THIS THIS IS ABOUT THE SIMPLE FACT. THAT WE ALL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM THERE'S FORTY YEARS PLUS OF CASE LAW WILL MEMBERS I'M ONLY THIRTY FIVE. WE HAVE IMMIGRANTS TO OUR COUNTRY WHO ARE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WHO BARELY UNDERSTAND ENGLISH LET ALONE THE COMPLICATIONS OF OUR LAW. WE HAVE YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS WHO DON'T REALIZE ALL THESE THINGS WE HAVE CITIES AND COUNTIES AND MUNICIPALITIES THAT GIVE THESE PEOPLE PERMITS THE SAKE HAGER GOOD TO GO SO THEY'RE EXCITED AND THEY THINK THEY'RE OKAY. THE FACT IS WE HAVE A BROKEN SYSTEM. WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT IS DENYING ACCESS FOR OUR DISABLED COMMUNITY. AND THAT NEEDS TO GET FIXED. IN THIS BILL BEFORE YOU INSURERS THAT. AS THESE THINGS ARISE WE CAN HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH IN OUR COMMUNITY AND GET. THE BARRIERS BROKEN DOWN AND GET THEM FIXED AN ENSURE IT'S NOT JUST A LITIGATION. IT'S NOT A LOSS TO IT'S KEEPING THE DOORS OPEN AND PROVIDING ACCESS FOR EVERYBODY. I ENCOURAGE YOUR I'VE THOUGH AND I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS BECAUSE I WANT TO ENSURE THAT MY SON.
