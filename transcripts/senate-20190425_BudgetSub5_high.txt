OVER ISSUES EIGHT THROUGH ELEVEN GET INTO DEEP IT'S AN ISSUES EIGHT THROUGH ELEVEN ALSO SELF. I BELIEVE IT WORKS ONCE IT WAS GONNA BE PRESENTING [inaudible] RIGHT -- X.

TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND ONE POINT NINE MILLION GENERAL FUND AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO IN ONGOING. RELATED TO RESOURCES BECAUSE WE ARE FOR SEE AN INCREASE IN PAROLE HEARINGS. AS PART OF NOT PART OF THE B. C. P. BUT AS PART OF THE POPULATION PROCESS. ALSO REQUESTING TO ADJUST THE RATES WE PROVIDE ATTORNEYS WHO REPRESENTS INMATES AT THE HEARINGS. FOR THE FIRST AGENDA ITEM I IF WE COULD. BRING UP BUT JENNIFER SCHAEFER WHO'S THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE BOARD OF PAROLE HEARING SIXTEEN GET INTO GREATER DETAIL BUT THE THE AGENDA DOES HE DO A GOOD JOB TALKING ABOUT THE MANY COMPONENTS. OF THIS PROPOSAL. I'M LET BEFORE. AN YOU BEGIN JENNIFER I WOULD JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR. WHAT THESE ITEMS ARE I HAVE ONE BCP IN FRONT OF ME WHICH IS THE? HE TO ADD. THE TWO NEW MISSIONERS AND ALSO TO ADD BOTH SOME PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY FOLKS DUE TO THE BAND NUMBER [inaudible] PAROLE HEARING. I DO WE HAVE A SEPARATE THE ATTORNEY [inaudible] OKAY ALRIGHT SO [inaudible] I'M -- YOU'LL GET INTO THIS BUT I AND THERE'S ALSO A REQUEST. TO INCREASE. PAYMENT THE ATTORNEY. EVER B. B. C. P. -- DOCUMENTS THAT I HAVE BEFORE ME. NO DESCRIPTION THAT [inaudible] AND NO THE LA -- WE'LL GET INTO IT. DELEON COMMENT ON IT -- BUT I WONDER -- WHAT IS THE? WHERE'S THE PAPER WORK THAT WOULD. GIVE US THE ABILITY YOU IT YEAH. LITTLE MORE THAN THE FULL PRESENTATION IT'S A YEAH IT'S IT'S A LITTLE BIT IT'S PART OF OUR POPULATION PROCESS WHICH WE YOU KNOW WE FORECAST ARE IN MAYES PAYMENT OR ATTORNEYS IS PART OF YOUR POPULATION PROP. IT'S WITH THAT ASSUMPTION WE MADE IN OUR POPULATION PROCESS HOW MUCH WE'RE GOING TO PAY ATTORNEYS AND WE ASKED FOR AN INCREASE. ASSOCIATED WITH THAT PROPOSAL BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY THERE IT'S MENTIONED IN THE POPULATION -- BINDER THAT TO ALL OF YOU GET BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY PROVIDE MORE INFO TO IN WRITING TO EXPLAIN IT BETTER. OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL -- I WILL ALLOW YOU TO PRESENT BUT I FIND IT LACKING. NOT THAT I CAN REVIEW OTHER THAN WHAT YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME PERFECTLY. WE CAN CERTAINLY NO WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT GONNA VOTE TODAY BUT IT'S STILL A YEAH. ALL RIGHT SO SO THEN BEFORE YOU BEGIN. WHAT? JUST AS THE UNDERSTANDING WHAT IT IS PRESENT ON YOUR WHAT CAN EXPLAIN. WHY YOU WANT TO EXPAND? THE NUMBER OF MICHENER'S. WHY YOU WANT IT NO MISSION ASSOCIATED WITH OR TROLL WHY -- THIS PROCESS THAT YOU ARE CONSIDERING WHICH ARE ALSO VERY LITTLE INFORMATION ABOUT. FOR REVISION TO STREAMLINING. THE PAROLE PROCESS BASED ON SOME OTHER STATES MODEL BUT AGAIN I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT OTHER STATES THEY ARE BUT THAT'S OKAY WE'LL JUST. I'M AND ADDITIONALLY D. I. YOUR PROPOSAL TO INCREASE THE PAYMENT TO THE ATTORNEYS REPRESENTS THE PEOPLE WHO GO BEFORE THE PAROLE. IS THAT CORRECT SO IT'S FIVE COMPONENTS YES. RIGHT RIGHT THOSE DOWNSIDE TO THEM IN ORDER BUT I CAN'T YEAH NOT DETERMINE THAT ORDER BUT I DO WANT TO MORE MATERIAL. WE WILL DEFINITELY PROVIDE YOU WITH OKAY GO AHEAD SO THE OVERALL ISSUE FACING THE BOARD IS A 38% INCREASE AND PAROLE HEARINGS THAT WE'RE PROTECTING NEED TO BE SCHEDULED BEGINNING IN FISCAL YEAR. NINETEEN TWENTY THE REASON OF OR THAT INCREASE IS MULTI FACETED. WE HAVE HAD A COMBINATION OF BOTH LEGISLATION AND LITIGATION THAT HAS RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN. INMATES WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR PRO SUITABILITY HEARING. I'LL START WITH TIME USE OFFENDERS YOUTH OFFENDERS -- SENATE BILL A TWO SIXTY ONE AND ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN AWAIT WHICH EXPANDED THE YOUTH OFFENDER LAWS TO PEOPLE WHO ARE OLDER WHEN THEY COMMITTED THEIR CRIMES. NOW DETERMINEDLY SINCE YOUTH OFFENDERS WHO COMMITTED THEY'RE THEY'RE CONTROLLING OFFENSE WHILE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY SO TWENTY FIVE OR AN UNDER. ARE ELIGIBLE FOR POSTED ABILITY HEARING AFTER SERVING FIFTEEN TWENTY OR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. THOSE LEGISLATIVE MEASURES HAD -- TO DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION. WE FOUND SECIFICALLY WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SB TWO SIXTY THE FIRST YOUTH OFFENDER LAW. THAT DETERMINEDLY SENTENCED YOUTH OFFENDERS IN PARTICULAR WERE IN OR NOT -- VERY WELL SUITED FOR PAROLE -- WE KIND OF COIN THE PHRASE THAT IT'S REALLY NOT A GOOD IDEA TO SURPRISE SOMEBODY WITH THE PROFITABILITY HEARING. SO THEY WERE NEVER EXPECTING TO COME BEFORE THE BOARD THE I'M NOT BEEN PROGRAMMING AND THEY DIDN'T REALLY THINK THAT THEY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY. TO AFFECT THEIR FUTURE. AND SO WE WORKED WITH -- THE LEGISLATURE BACK THEN TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL TIME FOR THOSE FOLKS TO ACTUALLY ENGAGE IN PROGRAMMING. I'M PREPARE FOR THEIR PROFITABILITY HEARINGS AND ULTIMATELY WHAT HAPPENED WITH BOTH OF THOSE BILLS IS THAT THEY GAVE THE BOARD. AND THE INMATES AND TELL THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO GET EVERYBODY ON CALENDAR WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR HEARING WHEN THOSE BILLS TOOK A FACT. SO WE HAVE ABOUT EIGHTEEN HUNDRED DETERMINEDLY SINCE YOU THE VENDORS THAT WE NEED TO GET ON CALENDAR BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE COULD HAVE HANDLED DIED WITHOUT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES -- THE WAY THE BOARD WORK WE HAVE TO HAVE THREE PERSONS ON A PANEL UNLESS WE HAVE A BACKLOG IN WHICH CASE WE CAN USE 2% ANNALS. THE WAY OUR HEARINGS FLUCTUATE. WE CAN WE HAVE -- WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF WIGGLE ROOM AS TO WHEN WE SCHEDULE SOMEBODY FOR HEARING AS WE TRY TO MANAGE THAT AS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE WE PROBABLY COULD HAVE WITH FIFTEEN OUR CURRENT FIFTEEN COMMISSIONERS. HANDLE THAT WORKLOAD. HOWEVER WHEN THE IN RAY EDWARDS DECISION WAS DECIDED AND WE ENDED UP IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS FOR NONVIOLENT INDETERMINATE LICENSE IN MAINE. PRIMARILY NONVIOLENT THIRD STRIKERS. THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PRO SUITABILITY HEARING AFTER THEY'VE SERVE THE FULL TERM OF THEIR PRIMARY OFFENSE. AND THAT WAS A CHANGE IN THE LAW WHEN WE IMPLEMENTED PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN WE THE STATE ONLY EXTENDED IT TO DETERMINEDLY SENTENCED OFFENDERS. THE COURTS CAME BACK AND SAID NO THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT UNDER PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN REQUIRES US TO ALSO PROVIDE A PAROLE -- PROCESS FOR NONVIOLENT INDETERMINATE LICENSE OFFENDERS. WE DID OUR PROJECTIONS OF ABOUT -- FOUR THOUSAND NONVIOLENT -- INTO TERMINALLY SENTENCED OFFENDERS WHO WERE INCARCERATED AT THE TIME. AND WE THOUGHT THAT OUR PROJECTIONS SHOW THAT ABOUT TWO THOUSAND WOULD BE IMMEDIATELY ELIGIBLE FOR NEW HEARING FOR HEARING. SO WE HAD ABOUT EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AGAIN THAT WE NEEDED TO GET ON CALENDAR AND THE REGULATIONS THE COURTS WERE NOT VERY -- THEY WERE NOT VERY PATIENT -- WITH THE IDEA OF HOW QUICKLY WE SHOULD GET THESE FOLKS ON CALENDAR AND SO WE'VE BUILT THE REGULATIONS SO THAT IF THOSE FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN DOWN THE LONGEST. I'VE BEEN INCARCERATED LONGEST WOULD GET HEARINGS FIRST THEY GET A PRIORITY HEARING -- BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY AND THEN THE REMAINDER WOULD HAVE A HEARING BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT KIND OF PUTTHE BOARD OVER THE EDGE. I'M AN ADDITIONAL TWO THOUSAND HEARINGS ON TOP OF ALL OF OUR OTHER HEARINGS -- WAS MORE THAN WE COULD HANDLE WITH OUR CURRENT PANELS. IN ADDITION -- ANYTIME THAT WE CONDUCT MORE HEARINGS IT GENERATES MORE FEATURES. AND I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE IF SOMEBODY HAS A RECEIVED A THREE YEAR DENIAL ONE YEAR. THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO ADVANCE OUR NEXT HEARING DATE TO A TIME THAT'S EIGHTEEN MONTHS FROM THEIR LAST HEARING. SO ANY TIME THAT WE PUT ON MORE HEARINGS. A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE RESULT IN A THREE YEAR DENIAL. A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THOSE ARE THEN PUT BACK ON CALENDAR EIGHTEEN MONTHS LATER. SO THIS IS CAMILLE WOULD HAVE A FACT THE MORE HEARINGS WE SCHEDULE THE MORE HEARINGS IT ENDS UP KIND OF SNOW BY SNOWBALLING BLACK BETTER. ON FUTURE YEARS AND SO WE ARE ESTIMATING THAT THE NUMBER OF HEARINGS THAT WE WILL HAVE TO ADD BACK INTO OUR HEARING CALENDARS RESULT OF ADVANCED HEARING DATES. TO OUR OWN TO RESPOND PAY PROCESS AND AS A RESULT OF PETITIONS THAT INMATES IN FILE TO ADVANCE OUR NEXT HEARING DATES -- IS ROUGHLY ANOTHER TWO THOUSAND SO IT'S KIND OF THREE EQUAL INCREMENTS. AND SO FOR US -- THAT'S A LOT MORE SO WHEN FACED WITH THE THE IDEA OF DO WE WANT TO EXPAND THE BOARD BY 40%. WE ALREADY HAVE FIFTEEN BOARD MEMBERS AND IT SEEMS IS IT'S THE BOARD OPERATES WE FIRST LOOKED TO SEE IF WE CAN DO THINGS MORE EFFICIENTLY -- WITHIN OUR EXISTING RESOURCES AND SO WE SAT DOWN AND WE STARTED REALLY THINKING ABOUT HOW CAN WE DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY IT WAS NOT TO COME IN FOR WITH A RESOURCE REQUEST THAT WOULD BE -- PRETTY SIGNIFICANT -- AN UNPRECEDENTED THE BOARD TO BE EXPANDED THAT MUCH IN ONE YEAR. SO WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING -- WITH OTHER JURISDICTIONS FOR A HOW THEY HANDLE THEIR HEARINGS AND WE FOUND THAT -- STRUCTURE DECISION MAKING SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS GOING TO BE A VERY GOOD OPTION FOR THE STATE. AND WITH THE USE OF STRUCTURED DECISION MAKING WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY PRODUCE THE SAME QUALITY DECISIONS. AND THE HAVE INCREASE THE TRANSPARENCY IN THE CONSISTENCY IN OUR DECISION MAKING. AND ALLOCATE LESS TIME PER HEARING -- FOR ALL OF OUR SCHEDULED HEARINGS. WE'RE ALSO LOOKING TO ADDRESS I APOLOGIZE I'M GONNA BOUNCE AROUND A LITTLE BIT. OF WITH. IN THE INCREASE IN ATTORNEY'S FEES THAT WE CAN PAY BOARD APPOINTED COUNSEL. ALONG WITH EXPECTATIONS THAT WE PLAN TO BE PUTTING IN PLACE. TO GO WITH THAT INCREASE IN FEES WE THINK WE CAN ACTUALLY INCREASE THE QUALITY OF ATTORNEY REPRESENTATION WHICH CAN ALSO HAVE A PRETTY DRAMATIC IMPACT ON OUR HEARING CALENDARS GOING FORWARD. I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF SOMEBODY IS FACING A AT THREE A MINIMUM THREE YEAR THE NILE. AND YET THEY CAN THEY CAN VOLUNTARILY WAIVE THEIR HEARING FOR A YEAR. WITH NO FOR ANY REASON. IF THEY THINK THAT THEY MAY BE MORE LIKELY TO BE SUITABLE IN THE VERY SHORT TERM THAN A YEAR THEY CAN WAIVE THEIR HEARING FORTY FIVE DAYS IN ADVANCE OF THAT HEARING. AND NOT GO FORWARD WITH THEIR HEARING AND NOT RISK HAVING A A LINK TO YOUR DELYLAH MARCY'S LAW. RIGHT NOW OUR FEE SCHEDULE IS SUCH THAT WE INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO GO TO HEARING. ATTORNEYS GET MORE MONEY IF THEY ACTUALLY GO TO HEARING. AND IN TALKING TO IN MAKE COUNSEL AND INMATES AND ADVOCACY GROUPS WE KNOW THAT. BOTH THE MERIT OF AN ATTORNEY -- REPRESENTING THESE INMATES IN THESE IN THESE HEARINGS IS A PREPARATION WORK THAT THEY DO WITH THOSE THAT WITH THE INMATES. AND SO THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE THE FEE SCHEDULE IS A LITTLE BIT -- IT INCENTIVIZE IS WE THINK OF BEHAVIOR THAT WE PROBABLY DON'T WANT TO INCENTIVIZE -- WE WANT TO LOOK AT INCREASING THEIR FEES BUT ALSO RESTRUCTURING HOW WE PAY. WE LOOKED AT SEVEN COUNTIES AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO SEE HOW MUCH THEY PAY DEFENSE COUNSEL -- PER AND OUR AND THEIR MAXIMUM CAP FOR CASE -- WHEN DETERRENT WITH LOOKING AT -- HOW MUCH DO THEY? HOW MUCH DO THEY PAY -- ATTORNEYS WHEN THEY HAVE TO A POINT -- CONFLICT COUNSEL. IN CRIMINAL CASES AND THEY AVERAGE BETWEEN SIX AND EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS IN FACT AND THE ACTUAL AVERAGE COLLEGE EYES IS. I WANT TO SEE SIX HUNDRED AND SOME ODD DOLLARS ARE SEVEN HUNDRED AND SOME ODD DOLLARS SO LESSEN WHAT WE ARE REQUESTING A TO INCREASE OURS. I WOULD LOVE TO GIVE YOU A LOT OF DETAILS AS TO HOW WE'RE GOING TO IMPLEMENT THAT UNFORTUNATELY. OR FORTUNATELY I'M NOT SURE WHICH PUMP. WE HAVE BEEN SUIT -- FOR IN IN COURT. FOR FROM THE LOW FEES THAT WE PAY IN MAKE COUNCIL IT'S A CASE CALLED IN RAPE POOL. AND WHAT THEY'RE ALLEGING IS THAT TO OUR FEES ARE SO LOW THAT EDICT PLATES TO INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE ALSO. AND SO WE ARE IN SELDOM SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE PLAINTIFFS IN THAT CASE AND SO THOSE ARE PROTECTED -- THEIR CLASS ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENTIAL INTEL THESE SETTLEMENT AGO SHE TIONS ARE FINALIZED AND IT WILL HAVE TO BE APPROVED BY THE COURT. SO UP WERE ASKING FOR THE MONEY AND BASICALLY SAYING THAT -- WE WILL BE WORKING WITH THE PLAINTIFFS IN THAT CASE. AND THE COURT TO COME UP WITH A REASONABLE -- METHODOLOGY FOR NOT ONLY INCREASING THE FEES BUT WHAT THE FEE SCHEDULE LOOK BY. AND ALSO PUTTING IN -- NEW EXPECTATIONS THAT HOPEFULLY WE CAN MONITOR AS WELL AS A TRAINING PROGRAM WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT. HOW UNCOMFORTABLE AND POTENTIALLY INAPPROPRIATE IT IS FOR THE BOARD TO BE TRAINING TO NOT ONLY HIRE COUNSEL TO REPRESENT PEOPLE THAT COME BEFORE THE BOARD? BUT THEN ALSO TRAIN THEM. AND VERY THAT SAID IT'S NOT A VERY GOOD POSITION FOR US TO BE AND SO WE ARE LOOKING AT POTENTIALLY CONTRACTING WITH AN OUTSIDE -- ACADEMIC INSTITUTION A LAW SCHOOL ONE WHO HAS A LOT OF EXPERIENCE ACTUALLY TRAINING ATTORNEYS TO REPRESENT LAW STUDENTS TO REPRESENT PEOPLE BEFORE THE BOARD. AND HAVE THEM PROVIDE THAT KIND OF ADVOCACY TRAINING THAT WOULD BE KIND OF INAPPROPRIATE FOR US TO DO. SO HOW COME WE HOPE WE THINK THAT'S GOING TO COME TOGETHER AND REALLY HELP -- ARE HEARING CALENDAR BUT ALSO IMPROVE THE PREPARATION INMATES WILL RECEIVE FOR THEIR THEIR PROFITABILITY HEARINGS THOSE ARE THE TWO MAIN COMPONENTS. A IN ADDITION TO EVEN IF WE INCREASE OUR CALENDARS USING STRUCTURE DECISION MAKING MORE HEARINGS PER PANEL PER DAY. I'M WE STILL DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO HANDLE THE INFLUX OF HEARING SO WE'RE ASKING OF THE LEGISLATURE TO EXPAND OUR BOARD BY TWO PERSONS THAT GIVES US THE CAPACITY TO HANDLE ALL THOSE SCHEDULED HEARINGS. WITH THE INCREASED CALENDAR USING STRUCTURED DECISION MAKING. THE OTHER RESOURCES THAT WERE ASKING. FOR IN ADDITION. GIVE AN EXAMPLE LAST YEAR WE WE RECEIVED OVER FORTY THOUSAND PIECES OF CORRESPONDENCE -- IN CONJUNCTION WITH ALL OF OUR PAROLE HEARING PROCESS SEES. AND WE RESPOND TO THOSE TO ALL% ABOUT CORRESPONDENCE WE ALSO HAVE TO SEND OUT HEARING NOTICES UNDER THE LAW. WE DO THAT ALL ELECTRONICALLY NOW BUT I STILL HAVE STAFF THAT HAVE TO ACTUALLY PUT ALL THAT TOGETHER -- MAIL THEM OUT TO THE PEOPLE THAT WANT THAT MAILED OUT EMAIL AMOUNT TO THE FOLKS WHO WANT TO RECEIVE THEM VIA EMAIL. AND SO ANYTIME WE INCREASE OUR HEARING THE NUMBER OF HEARINGS THAT ARE GOING TO BE SCHEDULED. IT RESULTS IN SOME -- ADDITIONAL DUTIES FOR OUR ADMINISTRATIVE A SAID OUR OFFICE ASSISTANCE OUR OFFICE TECHNICIANS AND OUR ASSOCIATE GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAM ANALYSTS SO WE WENT THROUGH AND WE FOR EACH ONE OF THOSE CATEGORIES WE TRY TO MAKE THEIR PROCESSES AS EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE. SO THAT WERE NOT REQUESTING A COME UP WITH SOME ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND ACTUALLY -- NOT REQUEST -- THAT SIGNIFICANT IN GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS IT'S NOT THAT SIGNIFICANT OF RESOURCES FOR US. TO ACCOMPLISH THAT. THE LAST PIECE ARE OF TWO PIECES -- WHEN OUR ATTORNEYS WE HAVE NOT EXPANDED OUR LEGAL STAFF FOR QUITE SOME TIME? THEY DO TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK INTERACTING WITH ALL THOSE IN MAKE COUNCIL SO AS WE INCREASE HEARINGS WE ALSO INCREASE. ATTORNEY CONTACTS OBJECTIONS PRE HIT PRE HEARING OBJECTIONS MOTIONS COUNSEL TO THE TO THE PANELS WE HAVE A LEGAL HOTLINE. ANYTIME THERE'S A PRO HEARING GOING ON ANYWHERE IN THE STATE THE PANEL CAN CALL AND GET LEGAL ADVICE ON HOW TO HANDLE SOMETHING. THEY ALSO DO ALL THE DECISION REVIEWS ON THE BACK AND THEY REVIEW ALL THE DECISIONS REFER THINGS FOR REVIEW BY THE FULL BOARD. THEY ALSO PROPAGATOR REGULATIONS AND THEY ARE THE MAIN LIAISONS BETWEEN US IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE FOR GRANTS OF PAROLE AND OTHER DECISIONS THE GOVERNOR REVIEWS. AS WELL AS OTHER STATE AGENCIES SO WE'RE ASKING FOR THREE ADDITIONAL ATTORNEYS TO HELP US WITH THE INCREASED WORKLOAD IN THAT AREA. THE LAST PIECE SORRY IS A CITY C. R.. A C. D. C. R. AS REQUESTED LIMITED TERM POSITIONS AND A COUPLE I BELIEVE -- THREE A PERMANENT POSITIONS. I HAVE TO HANDLE THE INCREASE IN WORKLOAD ONE OF THE REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS THAT CITIES YOUR DOES FOR US THEY DO A MYRIAD OF VERY IMPORTANT THINGS FOR US BUT ONE THAT THEY DO FOR US. WHICH IS THE PERMANENT POSITIONS WHICH I ASSUME YOU'RE MOST INTERESTED IN. ISN'T BASED SUMMARIZE -- BY LAW ONLY CORRECTIONAL COUNSELING STAFF HIGH LEVEL COUNSELING STAFF CAN DETERMINE WHAT INFORMATION IS CONFIDENTIAL AND WHAT IS NOT -- IN ORDER TO BE DISCLOSED IN ADVANCE OF A PRO HEARING IF THERE'S INFORMATION IN AN INNER FENDERS CALLED THE CONFIDENTIAL SECTION OF THEIR PROFILE OTHER. CENTRAL FILE. IF WE'RE GOING TO USE THAT -- IN OUR HEARING OR AS A REASON FOR OUR DECISION THE PROCESS REQUIRES THAT WE GIVE THEM A SUMMARY OF THAT INFORMATION SO THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO IT. SO WE ARE ASKING TO EXPAND THE NUMBER OF STAFF. THERE'S VERY FEW OF THEM THAT DO THIS WE'RE ASKING TO EXPAND THAT STAFF BY TO SEE SEE ONES. WHO THEN REPORT TO SEE SEE TO IT THE BOARD SORRY CORRECTIONAL COUNSELOR ONE AND CORRECTIONAL COUNSELOR? THREE I'M WHO WORK IN WHAT WE CALL A SATELLITE OFFICE OF THE CLASSIFICATION SERVICES UNIT TO PROCESS EVERY SINGLE IN ADVANCE OF EVERY SINGLE HEARING THEY REVIEW THOSE CONFIDENTIAL SECTION OF THE CENTRAL FILES. PROVIDE A SUMMARY AND THAT GETS TURNED OVER TO ME AND MADE ME A MAKE COUNCIL AND IT SATISFIES THAT DUE PROCESS IN ADVANCE OF EVERY HEARING. SO WE'RE ASKING FOR THREE POSITIONS -- TO ACTUAL COUNSELOR ONES. AND ONE CORRECTIONAL I'M NOT. HIS RECORDS ANALYST HER HE THEY THEY PROCESS ALL THE ALL THE DOCUMENTS THAT ARE SUBMITTED IN ADVANCE OF HEARING AND DETERMINE WHICH HAVE IN CONTAINS SENSITIVE INFORMATION THAT NEED TO GO TO THE COUNSELORS. AND THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES THAT CAN ACTUALLY. UPLOAD INFORMATION INTO AN INMATE SIMPLE FILE THE BOARD -- THOSE RECORDS ARE NOT OURS THE DEPARTMENT OWNS THEM SO THEY THE CIRCUIT STAFF HAS ACCESS AND THE ABILITY TO UPLOAD THOSE FILES INTO THE CENTRAL FILE WHICH IS REQUIRED. SO THOSE ARE THE POSITIONS THAT WERE REQUESTING IN ADDITION THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS IS REQUESTING LIMITED TERM POSITIONS ARM FUNDING FOR OVERTIME IN LIMITED TERM POSITIONS THAT THEY WILL NEED. IN ORDER CARRY OUT ALL THE DUTIES THAT THEY DO FOR EACH I HEARING THAT IS SCHEDULED. THAT COVER ALL FIVE I HOPE. A YES -- I KNOW LA -- HAS COMMENTS I ONE I BRING UP A COUPLE THINGS BEFORE. WE HEAR FROM EITHER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE EARLY -- AND THEN. WE HAVE AN ADDITIONAL PERSON THAT WE ASK [inaudible] TWO US AROUND IN THESE PRO ISSUES HI KEITH -- WIDELY FROM AND COMMON LAW WHO -- AS BEEN. REPRESENT OR HEARING INDIVIDUALS. FOR THEIR ROLE. AND IS ALSO BEEN TRAINING ATTORNEYS TO REPRESENT. PEOPLE WHEN THEY GO BEFORE PRO WHO HAS A LOT OF IT [inaudible] WITH [inaudible] BUT THE ONE IS [inaudible] BE ON YOU SITE THE A COUPLE OF THE LEGISLATION AS ADAM IN ADDITION NOT [inaudible] SEVEN WHETHER THINGS. YOU REFERENCE THE YOUTH OFFENDERS -- NOW. THE INCREASED NUMBER OF YOU. WILL HAVE. EARLIER THAN HAD. OR PERHAPS. NOT EVEN EARLIER BUT YOU MIGHT NOT. ARE ALL THOSE STATUTORY CHANGES THOSE. ALL THOSE PEOPLE. ARE THEY ALSO IMPACTED BY MORE SEAT LOTS SOON OTHER WORK. IS ANYONE. WHO GOES BEFORE THE PAROLE BOARD IN CALIFORNIA? SUBJECT TO THE CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE. THEY ARE NOT GRANTED ROLE IN THAT ROLE HEARING IT IS THREE YEARS WHERE THEY COME BACK. QUESTION I'M WELL I KNOW THERE WAS IRANIAN COULD EXPLAIN THAT ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS. THE SHORT ANSWER IS NOW EVERY SINGLE INMATE WHO COMES BEFORE THE BOARD FOR A REGULAR PATROL SUITABILITY HEARING WILL GET A MINIMUM DIALING OF THREE YEARS UNDER MARCY'S LAW. MINIMUM NO OKAY BUT IN THAT EVER BE SHORTENED THERE ARE A REVIEW PROCESS YEAH. SO I'M UNDER A SUPREME COURT DECISION CALLED IN RADIX. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT SAID THAT THAT IMBEDDED IN MARCY'S LAW ARE TO SAFETY VALVES OTHERWISE IT WOULD BE AN EX POST FACTO. APPLICATION LAW IF YOUR POTENTIAL INCARCERATION HAS BEEN. AUTOMATICALLY AUTOMATICALLY EXTENDED UNLESS THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY GET PEOPLE BACK ON CALENDAR WITHIN A PARTICULAR PERIOD OF TIME. THE OTHERS TO SAFETY VALVES THAT IN BETTER THAN MARCY'S LAW ONE IS THE INMATE'S ABILITY TO PETITION. THE BOARD TO ADVANCE OUR PROFITABILITY HEARING THE OTHER IS -- IN RATE FIX THE COURT SAID THAT -- THE BOARD ON ITS OWN MOTIONS RESPONSE THEY CAN ADVANCE SOMEBODY'S HEARING DATE. AND WE HAD NOT PRIOR TO IN RE VIC'S WE HAD NOT DONE THAT WE DID NOT HAVE A PROCESS FOR ADVANCING HEARING BATES ON OUR OWN MOTION. AND SO WE LOOKED AT ALL THE US SUPREME COURT CASE LAW BEHIND IN RADIX OR THAT WAS CITED CONVICTS. AND THEY TALK A LOT ABOUT PAROLE HEARING A PROBOARDS -- KIND OF-THEY WERE ASKING OR SUGGESTING THAT WOULD BE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC IF PROBOARDS WOULD FOCUS OUR RESOURCES ON THOSE WHO ARE MOST LIKELY TO BE FOUND SUITABLE. SO WHEN WE SAT DOWN AND FIGURED OUT HOW WOULD WE PUT TOGETHER -- WHAT WE WERE HOPING TO BE AN OBJECTIVE PROCESS FOR IDENTIFYING PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST LIKELY BE FOUND SUITABLE? AND THEN REVIEW THOSE FILES ON OUR OWN MOTION WHAT WE DECIDED WAS WE WOULD LOOK AT EL ALL INMATES WHO RECEIVED A LOW OR MODERATE OVERALL RISK RATING AT THE LAST HEARING. AND WHO RECEIVE THE MINIMUM DIALING OF THREE YEARS AND WHO HAVE NOT HAD A SERIOUS RULES VIOLATIONS SINCE HER LAST HEARING. RIGHT NOW WE LOOK AT THEM AT ELEVEN MONTHS AFTER THE LAST HEARING AND WE IF WE APPROVE THEM TAKE IT BACK ON CALENDAR EIGHTEEN MONTHS LATER. AND SO MAX MAXIMUM RATE CAN I AM. ELEVEN MONTHS AFTER TO SEE AND THEN THEY GET ON CALENDAR EIGHTEEN MONTHS AFTER WHICH IS. IT'S SLIGHTLY UNDER THE THREE YEARS. NO ACTUALLY IT'S EIGHTEEN MONTHS FROM THE LAST HEARING SO BUCKLE STATES ARE FROM THE LAST HEARING SO IT'S RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE. ONE OF THE THINGS IS KIND OF IMPORTANT WE HAVE HEARD -- CRITICISM -- THAT OUR ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW PROCESS WON'T GET THEM BACK ON CALENDAR YEAR AFTER THE LAST HEARING IMPAIRED MARCY'S LAW THE MINIMUM THAT EILING WAS A YEAR. PEOPLE CAN FILE A PETITION TO ADVANCE AND GET BACK ON CALENDAR WITHIN A YEAR GRANTED IT'S RARE IN AS A SUPREME COURT SAID. I'M THERE ARE VERY FEW THINGS ARE AMENABLE TO THAT KIND OF CHANGE -- IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THEY THE EXAMPLE THEY GAVE WAS PEARL PLANS OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT. WE CAN NO LONGER DIE SOMEBODY BASED SOLELY ON THE LACK OF PAROLE PLAN SO THAT IS KIND OF GONE AWAY AND WE HAVE TRANSITIONAL HOUSING. FOR PEOPLE SO EVEN IF THEY DON'T HAVE PRO PLANS IF WE THINK THEY'RE SUITABLE FOR PAROLE WILL GIVE THEM A GRANT AND THEY WILL GO TO TRANSITIONAL HOUSING SO. THOSE KIND OF SHORT TERM FIXES HAVE KIND OF GONE TO THE WAY SIDE RIGHT NOW EIGHTEEN MONTHS THE PEOPLE GET THEIR HEARINGS. BEGIN THE DEADLINE FOR US TO GIVE THEM HEARING INTERNALLY IS EIGHTEEN MONTHS FREQUENTLY THEY GET ON CALENDAR SIXTEEN MONTHS IT'S BETWEEN SIXTEEN AND EIGHTEEN MONTHS. IN THEIR LAST HEARING DATE IT'S A HIGHEST GRANT RATE. OF ANY ANY GROUP OF VENDORS THAT COME BEFORE US. SO WE'VE KEPT THAT PROCESS IN PLACE AND IT'S IT'S A REALLY SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CASES IT GET ADDED EVERY YEAR. RIGHT SO -- WE OBVIOUSLY. GOING TO HEAR FROM OTHER PEOPLE BUT GIVEN THAT THIS IS A BUDGET HEARING WHEN WE IF I CAN'T -- EXTRAPOLATE SOME OF THIS AND I'M. DOLLARS [inaudible] FIRST [inaudible] OUR IS. FROM THE DATA I HAVE SEEN. CORRECT ME. UR RATE OF APPROVAL. AT ROLE HEARINGS IS ABOUT 18%. I'LL GIVE YOU THE ACTUAL NUMBER I'M THERE'S SOME IS NUMBERS TO THAT I'M I THINK MOST PEOPLE IF YOU SAY THAT. I'M ARE GRANT RATE IS LAST YEAR AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN IT WAS ACTUALLY TWENTY TWO POINT 74% BUT MOST PEOPLE WHEN THEY SAY THAT THEY WOULD WHEN I SAY THAT THEY THINK THAT AUTOMATICALLY. MY GOSH MATH 7078% OR DENIED THAT'S NOT TRUE. I'M ONLY 22% OR GRANTED WHAT IS WHAT HOW WOULD YOU. CHARACTERIZE THE OTHER SO THE GRANT RATE RIGHT NOW. IS THE PERCENTAGE OF SCHEDULED HEARINGS THAT RESULT IN A GRANT -- SCHEDULED HEARING CAN RESULT IN A POSTPONEMENT A DENIAL STIPULATION A CANCELLATION A CONTINUANCE HER WAIVER IF YOU TAKE OUT ALL THE ONE IF YOU TAKE OUT EVERYONE IF YOU ONLY LOOK AT CASES WHERE A DECISION WAS MADE SOMEBODY WENT TO A HEARING AND THEY WERE EITHER GRANTED OR DENIED. PAROLE THE GRANT RATES 39%. I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT I'D LIKE BACK UP. ABSOLUTELY LIKE BACK. BECAUSE WHEN I BASS THE DEPARTMENT. AND IN GIVEN NUMBERS. MY NUMBERS WERE ALWAYS BY BASED ON YOUR MATERIALS YES MEAN EIGHTEEN AND 22% NOW THE REASON I'M GONNA RAISE THIS AND CLEARLY WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING NOW IS THAT. SOME NUMBER OF THOSE PEOPLE IN THE SEVENTY ODD THAT AREN'T. COULD. COULD END UP BEING RELEASED WITHIN A YEAR. MIND WHATEVER BUT IF WE LOOK. THIS WE JUST LOOK AT MARCY'S LAW. AND WE SAY ALL RIGHT. YOU. IF WE SCHEDULE. FIVE THOUSAND AND WHAT. DOES THAT WE WILL BETWEEN -- FOR TO UPWARDS -- SEVEN THOUSAND HEARINGS IN THE YEAR. LET'S SAY WE HELD. FIVE THOUSAND IN OUR RATE 18%. RECALCULATE THAT ARE RELATED REALLY THE LEAST ON THAT IS 18% AND THAT MEANS FIVE THOUSAND HEARING. 18% THAT MEANS THERE'S NINE HUNDRED PEOPLE THAT A MAN. FORTY ONE HUNDRED DON'T. THOSE FORTY ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE. STILL GO BACK IN OUR SITUATION AND THEN STILL WOULD HAVE. OR ANOTHER PRO BOARD I'M GETTING INTO THIS. RIGHT NOT AS THE AS A REFLECTION OF WHETHER. MORE THAN NINE HUNDRED PEOPLE. DIDN'T HAVE RATHER. SO. IF THOSE FORTY ONE HALF HUNDRED PEOPLE. AFTER WAIT THREE YEARS. THE COST TO THE STATE IS ONE POINT TWO BILLION. AS WELL THAT'S THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND OF COURSE THERE ARE SERRATION COST IS A LITTLE LESS BUT IF WE AND THAT. WILL COST YOU BROKE PROCESS OUT. THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY NOW. THERE'S OBVIOUSLY SOME NUMBER OF THOSE. FORTY ONE HUNDRED REALLY SHOULD NOT BE GRANTED PAROLE SO WE'RE NEVER GOING TO GET. YOU KNOW WE'RE NEVER GONNA. HAVE. ROLE FOR EVERY PERSON WHO GOES BEFORE. BUT IF WE YOUR THAT THERE SOME HIGHER PERCENT -- ACTUALLY. UNDER UNDER AGREED UPON OBJECTIVE CRITERIA. COULD HAVE BEEN RELEASED BY EITHER WARN ADEQUATELY PREPARED OR DIDN'T HAVE ADEQUATE REPRESENTATION OR WHO KNOWS WHAT. THEN THE COST TO US IS WHITE THE COST TO THE STATE IS QUITE SIGNIFICANT. I'M AND I JUST RAISE THIS BECAUSE I THINK AS WE DELIBERATE. IN ADDITION TO CLEARLY THE LANDS OF PUBLIC SAFETY IN THE LANDS OF MAKE -- WERE DOING THINGS. APPROPRIATELY AND EFFECTIVELY WERE ALSO MAKING SURE WE'RE DOING THINGS. SMARTLY FROM A COST. WHEN YOU VIEW [inaudible] I'M. ANYWAY I JUST WANTED TO RAISE THAT AND IF WE INCREASE THE NUMBER OF ROLE HEARING. AND WE STILL HAVE A LOW RATE SO WE GET UP TO SEVEN THOUSAND YEAR AND LET'S SAY WE EVEN GET 230% UNDER. SEVEN THOUSAND WE'RE STILL GOING TO BE ASKING US. IN THE ORDER OF ONE POINT FIVE TWO BILLION -- IT'S REAL. IT'S VERY RELEVANT TO US IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE WE DO BELIEVE THAT INCREASING THE QUALITY OF ATTORNEY REPRESENTATION IS OF REALLY SIGNIFICANT. A MOVE FORWARD IN IN HELPING MAKE THAT HAPPEN. WE ALSO -- IN THERE SO I WOULD LOVE TO AT SOME POINT I WANT TO GET TOO MUCH OF YOUR HEARING TIME TODAY BUT WE LOVE TO EXPLAIN THE ENTIRE HEARING PROCESS BECAUSE I THINK SOME PEOPLE -- I THINK THAT EVERYONE JUST GOES TO HEARING IN THERE EITHER GRANTED OR DENIED THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS GOOD REASONS FOR POSTPONEMENTS. I'M A LOT OF THEM ARE IN MATE -- GENERATED BUT THIS LAST YEAR I'LL GIVE YOU ACT. OUT OF IT YOUR FIFTY TWO WEEKS IN THE YEAR WE HAD TO BRING DOWN ONE PANEL. EVERY WEEK FOR TWENTY SIX WEEKS BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE A COMMISSIONER AVAILABLE. AND IT WAS THROUGH NO FOUR OF BOTH OF THEM THE STATE THE GOVERNOR I MEAN THEY WERE ALL THE POSITIONS WERE FILLED. WE TEST WHEN SOMEBODY RESIGNS IT TAKES A WHILE TO BRING SOMEBODY ON BOARD AND GET THEM TRAINED UP TO SIX SIXTY EIGHT WEEK TRAINING PROGRAM. WE HAD -- THREE OUT FOR MEDICAL REASONS THAT THEY COULD NOT. HELP OBVIOUSLY AND THEY WERE UNEXPECTED SO WHEN YOU HAVE SURGERY AND YOU'RE OUT FOR A MONTH -- WE HAVE TO BRING DOWN A MONTH'S WORTH OF HEARINGS SO WHEN WE ARE ASKING TO EXPAND THE BOARD BY TWO PERSONS. WE THINK THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY HANDLE THE HEARING LOW WITH. SIXTEEN COMMISSIONERS. AND USE ONE AS WHAT WE'RE DESIGNATING FOR LACK OF BETTER TERM AS A FLOATER. TO THAT PERSONAL BE ASSIGNED AS A THIRD PART THIRD PANEL MEMBER. AND THEN IF SOMEBODY IF I HAVE A PANEL THAT HAS TO COME DOWN SOMEWHERE IN THE STATE BECAUSE OF MEDICAL ISSUES ARE UNEXPECTED LEAVE. I CAN USE THAT COMMISSIONER TO BACK FILL AND NOT LOSE HEARINGS OR YOUR THAT MANY INMATES EVERY SINGLE WEEK AND TELL THAT PERSON COMES BACK ONLINE. SO I WANTED TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT METHODOLOGY BEHIND THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CYCLES THROUGH THAT CREATES THESE PROBLEMS IN OUR HEARING CALENDAR OR EXACERBATES THEM. ARE THE POSTPONEMENTS ESPECIALLY IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN HELP. SO THINGS LIKE IF WE DON'T GIVE SOMEBODY THE NOTICE OF RIGHTS OR IF WE'VE DONE SITE THEY HAVEN'T GOTTEN THE NECESSARY DOCUMENTS THAT DUE PROCESS REQUIRED THAT THEY GET. WHICH IS WHY THE COUNSELORS ARE SO IMPORTANT THEY'RE THE ONES THAT SERVE THOSE DOCUMENTS ON INMATES AND WE SEND THEM TO THEIR ANSEL IS WELL. IT'S ALL THERE'S A LOT OF PIECES TO IT IT AND IT HAS TO ALL WORK WELL AND EVERYONE HAS TO HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO DO WHAT THEY DO. SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THOSE HEARINGS BEFORE IT. I'M HEARINGS ARE VERY. I GO TO IT. ON FRANCIS WITH OTHER PAROLE RULING AUTHORITIES FROM. THIRTY THIRTY STATES ARE MORE AND SEVERAL OTHER COUNTRIES. I'VE YET TO FIND A SINGLE JURISDICTION HAS THE HEARINGS THE LENGTH OF HEARINGS THAT WE DO. AND THAT -- SPEND AS MUCH TIME AS WE DO TERMINATING -- PROFITABILITY SO WE'RE HOPING THE STRUCTURE DECISION MAKING-RULES WILL SHORTEN THE HEARINGS. AND HAVE THEM FOCUS ON WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT. THE ATTORNEY REPRESENTATION IF IT IMPROVES WILL HELP WITH BRING FOR HEARINGS YOU MAY SEE MORE PEOPLE FOUND SUITABLE IF THEY'RE PREPPED -- WELL BEFORE -- THERE IS THERE HEARINGS. I'M WE JUST DON'T KNOW -- AND OF COURSE. I BROUGHT UP. THE DOLLARS BUT THE OTHER ISSUE ISIF THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT. WHERE SUITABLE WHO ARE NOT? WONDER OUR CURRENT PROCESS EVEN A SMALL PERCENT WERE ACTUALLY FOUND -- THEN WE WHOLE. NOT ONLY IS IT US WEST. IT ALSO WERE UNDER ORDER TO OUR POPULATION AND A CERTAIN NUMBER. IT THEN END PROCESS AFTER YOU. MAKE OTHER DECISIONS OR MAKE OTHER COMBINATIONS THAT. YOU KNOW IF IT COULD. AND SHOULD LEAVE BE [inaudible] BETTER FIX [inaudible] IN THIS [inaudible] THIS WENT [inaudible] PURSES BROUGH. OTHER WAYS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO GET OUR POPULATION [inaudible] I'M. I WOMAN ASKED THE LA -- YOU THERE. WHAT'S ON THESE THINGS WE DID NOT GET INTO YOUR REQUEST AROUND THE I. T.. FOR WE ALSO HAVE NOT YET REALLY DISCUSSED BESIDES MISSION. YOU WANT A NUMBER OF NEW F. T. E.. A NUMBER THAT ARE PERMANENT AND THE NUMBER THAT ARE SHORT TERM. AND I GUESS I PERSONALLY WOULD WANT TO UNDERSTAND BETTER. LOGIC FOR THE SHORT TERM ON LIKE UNDERSTAND THAT BETTER I'M. AND THEN FINALLY. AFTER THE LA -- SPEAK SOMEONE ASK WHAT LEAD I'M IN A ABLE AS MY COLLEAGUES OUT. QUESTION PERFORMANCE. M. ROLE. WE'RE HAVING. PERSONALLY FOR ME BE ABLE. TO I'M REALLY GET INTO A DISCUSSION AROUND [inaudible] BE. STREAMLINING PROCESS AND BE. I'M. STRUCTURE DECISION MAKING FRAMEWORK. I WANT TO SEE IT I WANT TO SEE AND I WANT TO SEE EVALUATIONS OF IT I WANT TO KNOW WHAT OTHER STATES HAVE USED LIES IT I'M. I DON'T WANT TO THEY ALREADY THAT I HAVE ANY PREJUDICE AGAINST IT BUT I CERTAINLY IS. ALL. THE WOMEN ON GIVEN THAT ALL I HAVE. IS THE FOUR FIVE THAT IS IN A DARK. WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW THE SEVEN STATES WITH SEVEN STATE. I CAN'T THIS OHIO CONNECTICUT SOUTH DAKOTA WASHINGTON KENTUCKY IN UTAH. I'M IN IT PRETTY MUCH THE SAME FRAMEWORK OR THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CORRECTIONS HAS ADOPTED IT AS A BEST PRACTICE AND SO IT'S BEEN TAILORED FOR EACH OF THOSE JURISDICTIONS. ADMITTEDLY THOSE JURISDICTIONS -- DO NOT HAVE A LIBERTY INTEREST IN PAROLE. AND SO IN CALIFORNIA I'M OUR DUE PROCESS RIGHTS ARE MUCH DIFFERENT -- PAROLEES THAN THEY ARE IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS. THE BEST ANALOGY IS THE NATIONAL PAROLE BOARD OF CANADA THEY ALSO HAVE A LIBERTY INTEREST IN PAROLE THEY DO NINETEEN THOUSAND HEARINGS A YEAR. AND THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ORIGINALLY SPENT A DECADE -- DEVELOPING THS IN IMPLEMENTING IT. AND SO -- IT WE ARE WE'VE BEEN WORKING A LOT WITH CARLETON UNIVERSITY WHICH IS THE UNIVERSITY IN OTTAWA CANADA THAT -- DEVELOPED IT FOR THE PROBATIVE CANADA AND THAT'S WHERE WE'VE REALLY BEEN PUTTING OUR EFFORT IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS IN CANADA BECAUSE IT'S MORE NOW AGAINST ANY OTHER STATES TO US. YOU MENTION A STATE AND I HAD-CANCERS OHIO AN ETIQUETTE. SOUTH DAKOTA WASHINGTON KENTUCKY IN UTAH. AND THEY USE THEM FOR BOTH SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM OFFENDERS SOME OF THEM JUST SHORT TERM OFFENDERS SO. VERY VERY DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS IN DIFFERENT WAYS OF APPLYING IT. GREAT -- LA -- WANTED -- TO BY NOW AND WHAT WE WANT. TO HEALING O'NEILL WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S. I'LL GIVE ARE COMMON ON THE STRUCTURE. I'M MORE AND THEN [inaudible] YOU. DID YOU NOT HAVE ANY COMMENT ON THE DECISIONS AND THERE ARE. BERMAN INNER LIMITED TERM. WHEN WE REVIEWED THAT BUDGET REQUEST WE THINK THAT EVER? YOUR REASONABLE -- HOWEVER HAS ALSO INDICATED IN MY YOU MAKING FRAMEWORK. THE REQUESTED RECORD U. S. M. AT THE REMARK IS IMPLEMENTED ON TIME AT THE BEGINNING OF THE BUDGET YEAR AND IT HAS THE ANTICIPATED UP BACK ON THE LENGTH HEARINGS -- IF IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT EFFECT. IT'S POSSIBLE THAT ARE MEANT WOULD NEED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. IN OTHER WORDS AT EASE REQUESTED RESOURCES AS SOON. AS WELL IMPLEMENTATION OF FRAMEWORK [inaudible] AND SO. M.. WE DO THINK THAT THE FRAMEWORK AS IN KERR'S PROMISING GIVEN IT IS THE BEST. YES. I'M NOT ABLE TO REVIEW THE FRAME WE HAVE NO WE HAVEN'T WE HAVEN'T IN THE FRAMEWORK. OF THE RIVER REVIEW LITERATURE ON THE FRAME WORK ON IT I FRAMEWORK. I'M AND TO WE THINK IN GENERAL MEANS LIKE A PROMISING APPROACH. I'M BUT IT THE PROPOSAL LACK -- AND WE HAVE BE OUTLINED. INFORMATION THAT WE THINK -- IT LACKED IN YOUR IN THE REPORT WHICH IS REFLECTED IN YOUR AGENDA BUT AT A HIGH LEVEL. AND THE KEY INFORMATION. I IS THAT IS IT WOULD BE REQUIRED -- EFFECTIVELY EVALUATE PROPOSAL IS A PROCESS FOR DEVELOPING A FRAMEWORK. THE TIMELINE HOW WILL BE USED HOW OLD WILL BE IMPLEMENTED AND HOW WILL BE EVALUATED. WE THINK THAT THAT INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT THE LEGISLATURE HAVE IN ORDER TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT OF MENTALLY THING IF THEY CAN'T CHANGE IN HOW WE MAKE ROTH. AND AND AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THE FUNDING REQUEST [inaudible] EMPLOYMENT [inaudible] MARK. THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO LET. HAVE THAT INFORMATION. WE WILL HOLD RECOMMENDATION ON THE MUZZLE AND RECOMMEND DIRECTING -- DEPARTMENTS PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION IN A PROTOTYPE ALLEGEDLY REVIEW. I'M TO THE EXTENT THE DEPARTMENT IS NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT AND THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO MOVE FORWARD REGARDLESS. IN THAT ARE APPROVING RESOURCES ON A ONE TIME BASIS AND REQUIRING THE DEPARTMENT TO REPORT BACK WITH. THE INFORMATION IN TIME FOR IT TO BE CONSIDERED IN NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET DELIBERATIONS. MOVING ON TO EAT COMPENSATION FOR IT ERNIE'S APPOINTED BY THE BOARD. WE THINK THAT THE NEW PAGE BERKSHIRE A NEW KEEP A STRUCTURE DOES APPEAR NEEDED -- BUT AGAIN. WE FOUND THE SELECT AND KEY INFORMATION WHICH IS AGAIN OUTLINED IN YOUR GENDER BUT A HIGH LEVEL -- WE FOUND THAT IT DIDN'T HAVE A WE ARE OR SUFFICIENT -- EXPLANATION OR JUSTIFICATION IS. THE BASIS OF THE SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLAR PROPOSED PAYMENT I'M. THE STRUCTURE OF THE NEW AB EIGHT ABLE A SCHEDULE WAS NOT PROVIDED WITH THE IMPORTANT GIVEN THAT THE STRUCTURE OF THE CURRENT ONE HAS SOME -- POTENTIALLY NEGATIVE. THAT WE WANT TO AVOID RECREATING. I'M AND THERE WAS ALSO NOT M. HE TOLD INFORMATION PROVIDED ON THE CHANGES. BORDERS AT ANTICIPATING MAKING TO ATTORNEY RECRUITMENT TRAINING AND I AGAIN WE RECOMMEND DIRECT IN THE DEPARTMENT PROVIDE THE INFORMATION. I'M IF IT IS UNABLE -- I'M IN THE NEAR TERM AND ALSO IN LIGHT OF ENDING IT -- ASIAN LET. BUT BY. ONE AND IN OUR DEPARTMENT REPORT BACK ON THE BEAT. OUT THERE. IN TIME FOR NEXT. STONE THAT YOU MADE THE POINT -- ON THE ATTORNEY A BUT IN I AGREE WE DON'T EVEN HAVE WITH THE STRUCTURE WOULD BE. WORSE YOU HAVE THAT PAYMENT. OR THAT. CURRENT FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS. YOU. WHAT'S THE NUMBER OF HOURS ATTORNEYS ON AVERAGE WOULD SPEND. WOULD WE EXPECT. I MEAN THIS IS BUT YOUR FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS JUST HAS THIS LIKE. TWENTY FIVE BUCKS. FOR IS THE GREEN TO DO IT AND SEVENTY FIVE CORRECT. THERE'S AN IMPORTANT ECONOMY SCALE THAT GOES ON WE WHEN WE ASSIGN SOMEBODY WHEN WE APPOINT COUNSEL. WE ACCOUNT APPOINT THEM TO REPRESENT EVERY INMATE WHO'S ON CALENDAR AT THAT OFFENSE AT THAT INSTITUTION FOR THE WEEK. AND SO WHEN YOU GET FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS -- AN INMATE THAT YOU'RE REPRESENTING SOME MAY WAIVE THEIR HEARINGS EARLY ON SAME MAY END UP -- YES BUT THEY DON'T GET FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR IT ON YOUR NO NO NO YOU ONLY GET. A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE OF IT IF YOU AROUND YOUR ROLE HEARING YOU ONLY GET A HUNDRED OF IT IF YOU [inaudible] SO. WE IWILL SAY THAT EVEN GIVEN OUR CURRENT STRUCTURE. I'M WE HAVE NOT HAD -- WE HAVE WAITING LISTS FOR PEOPLE WANT TO DO THIS WORK. HOWEVER WERE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE QUALITY. AND THE EXPECTATIONS AVERAGE HOURLY RATE. ATTORNEYS IN CALIFORNIA IS. THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS AN HOUR. CURRENT RATE WE'RE IN FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS WHICH I CAN'T IMAGINE WE ONLY IN OUR OUR WORK. BUT THEY DO -- WE HAVE IT SET UP SO THAT WHEN THEY GO OUT TO THE INSTITUTION THEYCAN INTERVIEW ALL OF THEIR INMATES AT THE SAME TIME YOU KNOW THAT KIND OF THING OR YOU KNOW OVER A SERIES OF OF OURS. SO THERE THERE ARE SOME ECONOMIES IS. I I HESITATE BECAUSE AGAIN I'M NOT. IT'S A LITTLE UNCLEAR HOW MUCH I CAN TALK ABOUT WITH THE SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS IN THE CURRENT LITIGATION. BUT I CAN TELL YOU SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE WE ENTERED SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS ARE. GOING TERMS OF SKIN PRODUCT THAT LAWSUIT WOULD WE BE IN A SITUATION WHERE THE ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT REQUIRES A CERTAIN PAYMENT THAT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT THAN WERE ANTICIPATING YES. WHICH IS THAT. NO THEY'RE NOT ONLY. ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS WELL AND I'M NOT SURE THAT IT WILL BE RECTIFIED BEFORE THE END OF THE BUDGET YEAR OR SO WE'RE WORKING AS FAST AS WE CAN BUT I'M WILL% DEFINITELY BE IN A MUCH WORSE PLACE. LITIGATION WEISS IF WE IF WE DON'T INCREASE IT TO AT LEAST WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW OR WHAT WE'RE REQUESTING. SO IT COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF ITS NOT APPROVED. IN THE LITIGATION ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE CONTEMPLATED WHICH OF PERHAPS WILL BE SOUND A LITTLE BIT MORE -- VISIBLE IF YOU WILL FOR HIRING ATTORNEYS. IS THAT -- ONE OF THE CONCEPTS HAS BEEN PUT OUT THERE IS THAT. YOU ASSIGN SOMEBODY THERE A LEVIN CASES FOR THE WEEK OR TEN CASES FOR THE WEEK. AND YOU BASICALLY TREAT IT LIKE A SALARY. YOU GET SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR EACH OF THESE UNDER STATE BAR RULES YOU HAVE A LOT OF OBLIGATIONS IT SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLAR NO OVERSEEING GOING FORWARD IF WE DID THE SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS WE COULD STRUCTURE IT IN A WAY. WHERE YOU GET THE FULL AMOUNT THIS IS JUST HOW WE CURRENTLY DO IT WE'RE LOOKING AT REVAMPING THE WHOLE THING? SO THE IDEA WOULD BE INCREASED TRAINING INCREASE FEES BUT ALSO A DIFFERENT KIND OF FEE STRUCTURE SO I WAS JUST EXPLAINING WHERE THE THINGS IT'S BEEN -- EXPLORED AS A POTENTIAL OPTION IS ACTUALLY GIVE THE THE FULL AMOUNT FOR ACCEPTING THAT REPRESENTATION. AND THEN SOME OF THEIR CLIENTS AREN'T GOING TO NEED THAT MONEY THAT MANY HOURS AND THEN THEY COULD USE THAT TIME FOR THE OTHER CLIENTS TO DO RESEARCH. YOU NEED MORE HOURS SO THERE MIGHT BE DIFFERENT WAYS OF DOING IT THAT WAY WE DON'T INCENTIVIZE BEHAVIOR. I'M OTHER THAN PERHAPS WAVING MAYBE EARLY ON TO AVOID WORK BUT THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S A BAR ISSUE AND WE WOULD BE WORKING WITH AN OUTSIDE ENTITY FORCED OUT. WE HAVE A PROPOSAL THATWE HAVE SUBMITTED AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS. AND SO WE'RE STILL DISCUSSING IT WITH THEM AS WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ADOPT THEM. OR THE TOTAL MEANT THAT'LL AND WHATEVER WE ADOPT WE STILL DON'T HAVE. WE HAVE A DOLLAR AMOUNT FOR YOU BUT WE DON'T HAVE A KEY. I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW TO NAVIGATE ALL OF THAT TO BE HONEST I'M NOT SURE WHY I DON'T. I'M NOT SURE WHAT ALL I COULD IN GOOD FAITH. DISCUSS WITH THE LEGISLATURE INCOME ARRIVE IT WANT TO ACT. BY JUNE FIFTEENTH WHAT WE DESPERATELY NEED TO INCREASE THE ATTORNEY'S FEES I AM I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S SOME LANGUAGE SHOULD BE PUT IN THERE THE SUBJECT TO THE COURT'S APPROVAL. IN OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT BUT WE DEFINITELY BUT THE RIGORS OF THE STATE BUDGET PROCESS -- TIMING TIMING WISE IS NOT VERY CONDUCIVE TO SETTLING LITIGATION SO. I'M OPEN TO WHATEVER SUGGESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE FOR HOW TO STRUCTURE THAT -- BUT I DON'T WANT -- TO VIOLATE -- ISSUES THAT I HAVE A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT [inaudible] DOMINIC GLACIATIONS. I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT WORKS. AND WE'RE OBVIOUSLY NOT ACT I WIDELY [inaudible] ANY. THIS MAY HAVE THAT MIGHT BRING LIGHT ON OUR THE ENDING OF ME OPEN IT. I AM WIDELY I'M THE FOUNDER AND THANK YOU. UNCOMMON Là [inaudible] NONPROFIT. THAT FOCUSES ON HELPING. LIFE SENTENCE PEOPLE TO THE WORK THEY NEED TO DO IN ORDER. TO COME HOME [inaudible] I UP. AT THE TWO MEN. JENNIFER SCHAEFFER FOR THE THE TRANSPARENCY AND AND PROFESSIONALISM THAT BROUGHT FOR ABOUT [inaudible] I'VE KNOWN. ALL THE THANK YOU ALL. LAST NINETEEN YEARS. AND SHE'S DONE BY FAR MORE THAN THE REST [inaudible] PROCESS RIGHT. IN. EVEN THOUGH THERE'S THERE ARE MANY CHALLENGES I THINK SHE'S BEEN VERY OPEN ABOUT WHAT A LOT OF THOSE TOWNS THAT ARE -- SO IT GIVES US ALL THE OPPORTUNITY FIND FIND A WAY FORWARD WE HAVE. BEEN WORKING WITH PEOPLE. IN MOST OF THE PRISONS AND THEIR ROLE PROCESS YOU KNOW WE HONOR WE TALK ABOUT THE NUMBER A BUT THEY'RE ABOUT THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND LIVES. MY FAR MORE THAN ANY OTHER. AND THERE ARE THOUSANDS MORE WHO ARE NOT SERVING LIFE SENTENCES BUT AS OF SOME OF THE THE RECENT CHANGES. SHAPER MENTIONED ARE NOW SUBJECT TO BOARD REVIEW. SINCE YOU'RE MAKING PROCESS. WE HAVE HAD. BUT OUR IN OUR WORK WE'VE WE'VE HAD [inaudible] TWO HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN WE WE DO ENJOY A VERY LOW RECIDIVISM RATE FOR UNDER. ONE BUT WHAT WE REALLY FOUND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. IT'S BECOME CLEAR IN IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS OF DOING THIS WORK. IS THAT WHERE WE HAVE THE GREATEST SUCCESS. WITH OUR CLIENTS. THE WORK WE'RE DOING IS REALLY UP. OFTEN IS HELPING THEM DEAL WITH. THEIR OWN RESPONSES TO CHILDHOOD TRAUMA. AND HOW THAT TRANSLATED AND THEIR ACTIONS ASSOCIATION -- THAT HARM TO OTHERS AND LANDED THEM IN PRISON [inaudible] AND THAT'S A PROCESS THAT TAKES A LONG TIME REALLY EVEN TO ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP WE NEED TO WITH OUR CLIENTS. TO DO THAT WORK FOR THEM. TO DISCLOSE THIS THIS BELIEVE. WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT WE HAVE THE GREATEST SUCCESS? IN THOSE INSTITUTIONS AND IN THOSE INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS IN WHICH IN ADDITION TO OUR MEETING WITH THEM. THEY ALSO HAVE SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE INSTITUTION THEY CAN GO THE MAN. THAT MEANS THEY'RE INVOLVED IN. OTHER PROGRAMS IN THE INSTITUTION THAT ARE BUILT ON SOME TYPE OF RESTORATIVE JUSTICE OR SHARED SAFETY CHAIRED HEALING MODEL -- WHERE THEY CAN PROCESS THE STUFF IN ADDITION TO THE TWO HOURS WE SPENT TOGETHER? COUPLE WEEKS MONTHS. AND WHERE THOSE THINGS COME TOGETHER PEOPLE HAVE GREAT -- THOSE TEND TO BE LOWER SECURITY LEVEL PRISONS FOR A LOT OF REASONS WE COULD TALK ABOUT -- DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY BUT IT WILL WORK OUT THAT WAY. BUT I RECOGNIZE THAT AS THE MAJOR THING AND AND AND ALSO SEEMS THAT. OVER THE YEARS THE WAY THE ROLE MISSIONERS APPROACH HEARINGS. THAT WORK MATTERS MORE THAN IT USED. TO IT USED TO BE. WE TALKED ABOUT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT LITIGATION USED TO BE THAT ROLE FOR FOCUS ON THE PERSON PRIME. LANDED IN PRISON. AND IT REALLY DIDN'T MATTER HOW MUCH THEY CHANGE THEIR LIVES WHILE THEY'RE THE BOARD WOULD. BE. INCLINED TO DENY PAROLE BASEBALL. AND THAT PROCESS HAS IMPROVED SO THAT THE BOARD IS MORE INTERESTED IN HOW MUCH THE FIRST CHANGE. WHO THEY ARE TODAY? THE SHAPERS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN HELPING. TO ENCOURAGE THE COMMISSIONERS TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION AD AND CONTINUE TO PROVIDE TRAINING TO HELP THEM MOVE THERE AND AND AND THAT HAS HAS DEALT BUT A BIT -- THAT IS HELP BRING THE ROLE GRANT RIGHT WHERE IT IS. YOU ASKED THE QUESTION ABOUT. WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE SCHEDULED HEARINGS THE YOUR RESULT ROLL? AND IT WAS A VERY. YOUR WAY ASPECT. THE ANSWER BETWEEN 1822%. OF THE SCHEDULED HEARINGS ADULT IN THE ROOM. THAT MEANS THAT 78% OF THE ROLE ELIGIBLE PEOPLE ARE NOT. RELEASED EACH YEAR. THERE A LOT OF WAYS TO LOOK AT WHY THAT IS. BUT WE REALLY NEED A BREAK DOWN THE WHY THAT. BUT IT KNOWLEDGE YES THAT MEANS WEIRD IF IF. IF THE EXPECTATION. IN THE LAWS. IS THAT PEOPLE WILL NORMALLY BE BRANDED ROLE WHEN THEY WERE BROUGHT. UNLESS PUBLIC SAFETY. IN THE NATION THEY CANNOT BE REALLY. THEY SHOULD NOT BE WITH. PUBLIC SAFETY EXCEPT IT HAS COME. TO A SMALL THE RULE I THINK IN PRACTICE -- BUT WE DO SEE. ABOUT 20% OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE. ELIGIBLE ARE BEING GRANT. WE'VE SEEN OF A FEW OF THE THE CHANGES IN RESPONSE TO THE OVERCROWDING. INTENDED TO IDENTIFY. GROUPS WITHIN THE POPULATION THAT COULD SAFELY BE RELEASED -- REVIEWING CASES OF PEOPLE WHO ARE CONVICTED OF FOUR SERVINGS CONTRACTS AT FOR NONVIOLENT. THAT WAS ONE OF THE MEASURES THAT. SO THE IDEA WAS THE HERE'S SOME PEOPLE HO ARE NOT THERE FOR VIOLENT CRIMES. WE REVIEW THEM ON THE ROLE CONSIDERATION PROCESS. THIS HELPS US ROUTE REDUCE OVERALL POPULATION. WELL THERE PROGRAM RATES AROUND. WE ALSO WE ADDED. THE ELDERLY PAROLE CONSIDERATION RECOGNIZING PEOPLE WHO ARE SIXTY YEARS OLD OR OLDER. SERVE AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS IN PRISON. ALL THE THE SIGNS ALL THE LITERATURE INDICATES THERE MUCH LOWER RISK RESERVE A ESPECIALLY VIOLENTLY THAN THAN ANYONE ELSE. THERE PROGRAM RATES ARE STILL TWENTY SOME PERCENT [inaudible] YEAH NUMBER. THE OTHER PIECE THAT COMES UP I WAS IN THIS BUDGET TEAM ALSO ABOUT [inaudible] ADDING COMMISSIONER [inaudible] TWO TO ACCOMMODATE THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE. IT IS IT'S AN APPROACH THAT HAS BEEN USED [inaudible] SEVERAL TIMES. THE FIRST TIME I WAS FAMILIAR WITH BACK IN. TWO THOUSAND ONE THE BILL SEVEN SEVENTY EIGHT INCREASED. BUT INCREASING NUMBER MISSION IS. TO FIND WAYS TO DEAL WITH A BACKLOG OF HEARINGS [inaudible] THAT APPROACH. AS ADDED COMMISSIONERS OVER YEARS. BUT IT STILL HAS US AT A POINT WHERE WE NEED TO FIND OTHER WAYS. TO IMPROVE THE PROCESS. AND IF WE'RE IF WE'RE NOW. WHO? IN THE 20% RANGE. OF ROLE ELIGIBLE PEOPLE BEING ACTUALLY RAN IT. I'M REALLY EAGER TO FIND OTHER WAYS TO IMPROVE THE PROCESS SO I'M I'M ENCOURAGED BY WHAT THE SHAPERS DESCRIBING [inaudible] WITH. THE ATTORNEY APPOINTMENT PROCESS. THAT I AGREE HE THAT. IT NEEDS A LOT OF WORK IT IS. IT'S THE MAIN WAY THAT PEOPLE GET ACCESS TO THE KIND OF OUR WORK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE PEOPLE THAT WE WORK WITH MY TEAM I SAY WE SO. LISTEN TO THE LAWYERS ABOUT THE AMOUNT ALSO WORKERS. ALL THIS OTHER. LAW STUDENTS WE WORK WITH. WE ALSO TRAIN -- I DO A LIFER SQUARE ALL LIFE FOR SCHOOL OR TRAIN OTHER LAWYERS OF TRAIN HUNDREDS [inaudible] ATTORNEYS. HUNDREDS OF STUDENTS. TO DO THIS WORK. YOU WORKSHOPS INSIDE THE PRISONS ALSO. BUT MOST OF THE WORK IS IT'S IT'S BASED ON HELPING PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HERE THE KINDS OF ISSUES THE PRO WAR IS MOST CONCERNED ABOUT. HAVE YOU WORKED ON IF NOT LET'S DO THAT. LET'S GO FIGURE OUT HOW YOUR CHILDHOOD IMPACT RISEN WRESTLES IT. RESOURCES DON'T EXIST LET'S FIND. WE'LL SEND SOMEONE FROM OUTSIDE SOMETIMES WERE SENDING MATERIAL THE PEOPLE CAN WORK WITH. I'M AT WORK. IS THE THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF WHAT WE DO. TO THE WHEN WE GET TO THE PAROLE HEARING THEY'VE ALREADY DONE THE WORK THEMSELVES OUT. IT'S NOT ABOUT. WHEN I SAY IN THE HEARING VISION AS A NOT AT ALL INTERESTED IN WHAT I HAVE? AND THEY SHOULD BE IT'S NOT MY HEARING. IT'S HERE FOR THIS PERSON TO TO EXPLAIN HOW THEY'VE CHANGED. BUT IF. IF THE ATTORNEY IS NOT IN A POSITION. TO PROVIDE THAT KIND OF SUPPORT ESPECIALLY EARLY ENOUGH IN THE PROCESS. THEN I DON'T THINK WE'LL SEE A MAJOR IMPROVEMENT IN THE OVERALL WILL PROCESS A LOT MORE CASE. BUT I DON'T SEE I DON'T EXPECT A MAJOR INCREASE IN THE PROGRAM RATES. AND I KNOW THAT'S NOT EVERYBODY'S CONCERN [inaudible] BUT THAT'S MY CONCERN. BETTER ROLL OUT NOT JUST BECAUSE I WANT PEOPLE TO GET OUT OF PEOPLE SAFELY. AS I SEE WHAT THEY DO WHEN THEY GET THROUGH THE PROCESS SO. THAT'S THAT'S MY INTEREST BUT I LOOKED AT I LOOKED AT THE BUT IT. WAS A TALK ABOUT THE INCREASING MISTER. I'M OKAY WITH THEM INCREASE THE NUMBER. MISSION IS IF IT MEANS. THAT IT LEADS TO TIMELY FAIR HEARINGS A BETTER OUT. I HAD NO PROBLEM WITH THAT. THE INCREASE IN PAY. FOR OR THE ATTORNEYS. AS LONG BEEN NEEDED. I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. AND IT'S NOT NEARLY ENOUGH. THERE IS NOT ENOUGH AND AS AN EXPECTATION. NOW WITH RESPECT TO THIS PART OF THE PROCESS. I AM IN [inaudible] ABOUT THE BE INTERESTED IN BRINGING IN SOMEONE FROM THE OUTSIDE. OF LONG BELIEVED THAT. THIRD PARTY SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN THAT PROCESS. BUT I WOULD I WOULD GO A STEP FURTHER NOT NOT JUST IN PROVIDING. FOR FOR SOME ADDITIONAL TRAINING. WELL THE WHOLE PROCESS PROBABLY SHOULD BE RUNNING ROLE. BY A THIRD PARTY. DO YOU ACTUALLY. I AM A LITTLE APPOINTMENT PROCESS. INSTEAD OF FOUR FOUR YEAR. THAT'S ONE THING I THINK I WOULD RECOMMEND -- BE [inaudible] BE STUDIED [inaudible] REDUCE THAT. YOU KNOW RECOGNIZED GOOD AND BAD. ANGLES BUT THAT IN RECOMMENDATION WHETHER SPENT. A LOT OF REASONS THAT IT DOES IT. WOULD. TO I YEAH I AGREE WITH. DE L. A. O.'S BEST. VISION MAKING AT CARE POINTED OUT WE REALLY DON'T HAVE MUCH INFORMATION [inaudible] INDEED. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CONCERNS WHEN. WITHIN THE LAST FORMER WORLD ARE HEARING. ANYTHING IT SOUNDS LIKE. SURE OKAY. OUR AUTOMATIC PORT OF YOU TO GENERATE ANY THOSE KIND OF THINGS. OR RISK ASSESSMENT -- IS THAT WE GET REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT -- WHY IS THAT THAT MAY MAKE IT MORE LIKE THAT BLACK AND BROWN? I WILL GET BAD OUT. SO I'M REALLY EAGER TO HEAR MORE ABOUT. THE STRUCTURE DECISION MAKING MODEL THAT IS BEING ADAPTED PURPOSES WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT YET WE LOOK FORWARD TO LEARNING MORE ABOUT THAT IT. WE CAN HELP THE BOARD IN. SHAPING OUR PURPOSES. OR TO BE INVOLVED. WELL YOU'RE IN ABOUT. LEAVE SOON SENATOR BILL AT ANY AND THEN. I'LL JUST DO THE JUST A COUPLE QUICK. POINTS I WANT TO MAKE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP. ONE IS ABOUT. WHAT I THINK ARE SOME? EASIER MORE OBVIOUS. SIX IS TO THE PROCESS OTHER WORDS. OTHER WAYS WE CAN HELP IMPROVE. ONE HAS TO DO WITH. PEOPLE FOR WHOM ENGLISH IS NOT THEIR FIRST BY. WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THE? RATE. OFTENTIMES LANGUAGES SPANISH WITH A WHOLE LOT OF OTHER OF THE LANGUAGE. I'M ON WORK WITH IT. ENGLISH. MANY OF THEM HAVE. TROUBLE [inaudible] OR DOES [inaudible] A SIGN [inaudible] ROLL HEARING. THEY ALSO SIGN INTERPRETER FOR THE MEETING WITH. ALL OF THIS [inaudible] ROLL HEARING. LIKE LOGIC. INTO THE LANGUAGE. THEY DON'T TRANSLATE. THE TRANSCRIPT ROLE HERE. INTO THE LANGUAGE [inaudible] SO THAT. OFTENTIMES PEOPLE ARE UNABLE TO FULLY. FIVE OF THEM THE FEEDBACK HAVE BEEN FROM THEIR LAST. FOR THE THINGS YOU NEED TO WORK ON AND THE BRANCH WITH MAYBE A HUNDRED MORE PAGES. AND SO I THINK IT'S IF THERE WERE SOME. BUDGET ITEM SOME SOME MACINNES THOSE WITH SORT OF AN EASY FIX TO HELP PEOPLE BETTER. THAT'S THAT'S ONE THING ANOTHER RELATED THING IS ABOUT. BETTER ASSISTING PEOPLE WHO HAVE INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES. AND MENTAL ILLNESS. I THINK IF THAT COULD BE HAVING. SPECIALLY TRAINED ERNIE'S SIGN OF THOSE DAYS. IMPROPER ORDER. I DIDN'T COMPLICATED. TO MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE I'M A DATA. BOTH IN PREPARING FOR THE HEARING. DISSIPATE IN HEARING. END IN MAKING -- POST RELEASED. THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK BE ROUTE. AND THEN THE THE LAST THING ACTUAL RELATES TO THE WE TALKED ABOUT WITH THE ROLE OF THE ATTORNEYS IN THE BECAUSE I'LL I'LL I ALWAYS SAY THAT I'M I'M MORE BUT I'M STILL. LAWYER. TO WORK IT OUT. I ALSO LOOK FOR PEOPLE IN A RECRUITING STUDENTS OTHER ERNIE'S. I LOOK FOR PEOPLE WITH SOME KIND OF COUNSELING THEIR BACKGROUND OR SOMETHING LIKE. MOST LAWYERS NOT AN OUT THE SPORT. AND WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST IS THAT. RATHER THAN EXPECTING LAWYERS COMPARE. OR EXPECTING THEM TO SPEND WEEKS OR MONTHS -- DOING. COUNSELING. THAT THERE BE SOME EFFORT ON THE PART OF THE STATE. NOT MISTER THE BORDER ROLE HERE. WITHIN THE TO PROVIDE SOCIAL WORKERS -- I CALLED THIS. TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE THE SUPPORT PEOPLE BE FIGURE THEMSELVES OUT AND GET READY. FOR RELEASE ON PAROLE. AND AND I'M REALLY FOCUSING ON PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT. EARLY DIAGNOSE WITH THE AXIS ONE DIAGNOSIS THAN MIGHT OTHERWISE BE UNKNOWN A SLOW. FROM PROCESS SYSTEM. SUPPORT THEM AND THEIR NEEDS. ALMOST NONE OF WHICH FOCUSED ON PREPARING THEM IT WAS SORT OF ALRP DRAMA AND EXPLAIN THEIR THEIR OWN TRANSFORMATION. TO THE ROLE. SO THOSE ARE COUPLE RECOMMENDATIONS I HAVE. BEEN WORK IN THIS AREA FOR QUITE AWHILE IN A HUNDRED TO HEARING. QUESTION YOU HAVE THAT THANK YOU THERE ARE CERTAIN RE ENTRY FACILITIES. OKAY WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT. QUESTIONS BUT I HAVE I DON'T I DON'T HAVE YOUR OKAY. WHEN I CAN PLANE WHAT IS A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT CATEGORY OF INMATE THAT WE AUTOMATICALLY A BRAND? OR MAYBE HOW THEIR RIGHTS SO REENTRY FACILITIES MY MY FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING OF THEM IS THEY IDENTIFY EVERYONE WHO'S GOING TO BE RELEASED WITHIN A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME AND THEN THEY MOVE THEM TO A RE ENTRY FACILITY. BEFORE THEY GET ACTUALLY RELEASED RELEASED SO IT'S KIND OF A STEP DOWN PROGRAM IF YOU WILL INTO THE COMMUNITY. FOR LIFE CURRENT OR THE DETERMINEDLY SENTENCES BUT BEFORE THEY EVEN GO BEFORE PAROLE BOARD. YEAH THE FOLKS TO COME BEFORE THE PROBOARDS DON'T GO TO THE RE ENTRY FACILITIES BECAUSE I IN THE TRADITIONAL THAT KIND OF RE ENTRY FACILITY BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW. WHICH ONES THE GOVERNOR IS GOING TO UPHOLD AND WHICH ONES -- YOUR SHE MAY CHOOSE TO REVERSE OR SENT BACK TO THE BOARD FOR A FULL REVIEW. SO. YOU'LL HAVE THE HEARING THE DECISION IS A PROPOSED DECISION FOR UP TO A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYSWHILE. THE TRANSCRIPT GETS MADE IT GETS REVIEWED FOR ANY LEGAL ISSUES AND GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY -- NOTICE OF PUBLIC IN ADVANCE OF A PUBLIC BOARD MEETING. IF IT NEEDS IF THERE'S SOMETHING AN ISSUE NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED ONCE IT BECOMES FINAL THEN THE GOVERNOR HAS THIRTY DAYS TO ACT ON IT. ONE SET THIRTY DAYS IS OVER IF THAT IF THAT -- IF I GRAN IS UP HELD THE INMATES RELEASED WITHIN ABOUT A WEEK.% SO THERE'S NO SET IME PERIOD YOU KNOW YOU WOULDN'T PUT SOMEBODY IN THE COMMUNITY GENERALLY SPEAKING WHO'S A LIFE TERM IN MAY. TWO AS A GRANT PENDING IF YOU MAY HAVE TO BRING THEM BACK TO STATE PRISON BECAUSE THE DECISION IS NOT GOING TO BE FINAL. OUR IS NOT GOING TO BE UPHELD SO THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF POPULATION IF YOU WILL SO WHEN WE LOOK AT FOLKS FOR PURPOSES OF PAROLE. I'M AND THEIR PRO PLANS WE'RE NOT CONTEMPLATING A TRADITIONAL RE ENTRY FACILITY LIKE THAT INSTEAD THE DIVISION OF ADULT -- PRO OPERATIONS AND DIVISION OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS THEY HAVE A CONTRACT WITH THE TRANSITIONAL BEDS IN THE COMMUNITY. AND SO THESE FOLKS WE'VE NEVER HAD ANYBODY TURN DOWN FOR TRANSITIONAL BAD SO WHAT WE WILL DO IS ORDER AS A SPECIAL CONDITION OF PAROLE THAT THEY GO TO TRANSITIONAL HOUSING FOR SIX MONTHS. BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN IN THE INSTITUTION FOR SO LONG AND THAT TRANSITION FROM THAT VERY STRUCTURED ENVIRONMENT. TO SOCIETY AS A WHOLE CAN BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM AND SO MOST OF THEM THAT I GO OUT AND TALK TO ARE VERY THANKFUL AFTER A WHILE THAT THEY'VE GONE TO IT. INITIALLY THERE NOT SO HAPPY HOME GOING TO TRANSITIONAL HOUSING THEY WANT TO GO HOME TO THEIR FAMILIES AND THEY WANT TO YOU KNOW. GET ON WITH THEIR LIVES MOST OF THEM REALIZE AFTER ABOUT A MONTH TWO MONTHS THAT THEY WERE THEY'RE VERY GRATEFUL TO HAVE HAD THE STEPPING STONE BECAUSE THEY DID NOT ANTICIPATE. HOW OVERWHELMING IT WOULD BE? THAT'S STARTING TO GET BETTER CONVEYED TO THE INMATES -- BECAUSE THERE'S MORE PEOPLE ON PRO NOW SO THERE'S MORE PEOPLE GETTING THAT INFORMATION BACK INTO THE INTO THE PRISONS. BUT THAT'S THE KIND OF RE ENTRY THAT WE DEAL WITH IT'S VERY DIFFERENT FROM THESE KIND OF STEP INTO THE COMMUNITY PROGRAMS. OF THAT CDC ARE HAS FOR OTHERS YEAH AFTER HEARING. SO OUR RECIDIVISM OFFICIAL RECIDIVISM RATES -- RANGE FROM. MEANING A NEW CONVICTION AFTER. THREE YEARS OF BEING OUT ON PAROLE AND THE LAST THREE OUTCOME REPORTS STATES FLUCTUATED FROM [inaudible] IT'S ME [inaudible] I'M. THREE POINT 1% TO FOUR POINT 2%. OUR NEW CRIMES AND IN LESS THAN PERSONS. NOW WE'RE TALKING RATHER TO OIL. IT WOULD BE HIGHER FOR PROVIDING YES [inaudible] CORRECT [inaudible] COOL VIOLATIONS. IF I CAN SUGGEST ONE OF THE BETTER HELLO [inaudible] ARE YOU. SO THERE A COUPLE OF THINGS -- IF I MAY -- ONE IS. I DO YOUR P. THE DIVISION OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS HAS RECENTLY WITHIN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS EXPANDED THE THE LONG TERM OFFENDER -- PROGRAM TO ALL INSTITUTIONS. AND ACCORDING MY COMMISSIONERS THAT AND DEPUTY COMMISSIONERS THAT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE BEST PROGRAMS -- TO PREPARE PEOPLE FOR PRO SUITABILITY HEARINGS IS A COGNITIVELY BASED -- PROGRAM AND TO THEY LEARN A LOT FROM FROM GOING THROUGH THAT. AND SO -- WE'VE SEEN THAT IS BEING VERY ENCOURAGING FOR IMPROVING THE SUCCESS OF RELIGION ARE PROBABLY. INMATES I'M GOING TO THE RO PROCESS. I'M I THINK IT'S IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS I WILL TELL YOU WHEN THE THINGS THAT WE STRUGGLE WITH IS A STATE AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE INTEGRITY OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS -- STATEWIDE THAT SEEMS TO BE A SIGNIFICANT FOCUS THE MAJORITY THE RESEARCH OUT THERE WILL TELL YOU THAT YOU SHOULD BE FOCUSING YOUR RESOURCES ON HIGH RISK. INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE HIGH NEEDS THAT'S WHERE YOU GET THE BEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK WE PUT A LOT OF RESOURCES INTO THOSE FOLKS AND YOU CAN SIGNIFICANTLY -- DECREASE RECIDIVISM RATES. I'M IF YOU LOOK AT JUST LONG TERM OFFENDERS MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN DOWN FOR A LONG TIME THEY DON'T HAVE THOSE SAME KINDS OF VERY HIGH. CRIMINAL GENIC NEEDS AND SO THE ONE THING THAT I CAUTION FOLKS ABOUT IS IF YOU PRIORITIZE ALL OFYOUR PROGRAMMING JUST ON WHAT THE RESEARCH SHOWS WOULD BE THE BEST. BANG FOR YOUR BUCK. I'M. I THINK IT'S RATHER SHORT SIGHTED WHEN IT COMES TO THE LONG TERM OFFENDERS WHO NEED TO BECOME SUITABLE FOR PAROLE. BECAUSE THEY TO NEED PROGRAMMING TO ADDRESSED -- SOME OF THEIR NEEDS BUT I MOST -- TOOLS ARE NOT GONNA COME ACROSS IS REALLY HIGH RISK HIGH NEEDS IN HIGH RISK. SO I JUST FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT RE ENTRY IN PREPARING PEOPLE. ON THE LONG BILL TOP PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD AND THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER PROGRAMS OUT THERE. YEAH YOU YOU YOU REYES IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME THAT EVERY TIME [inaudible] HE BROUGHT [inaudible] PROCESS. AND A LOT [inaudible] THANK. WHAT I'VE WHAT I'VE BEEN SEEING IS PEOPLE WHO ARE DESPERATE? A LOT MORE. AND CITIZENS REMAIN. WHAT I SEE IS? THIS IS ESPECIALLY [inaudible] UNDER. NOT JUST THE SPOT. I UNDERSTAND WHY. IN A REIMAGINE THEIR RESPONSE THEIR OWN MATT. IN A WAY THAT THEY CAN ACT. OUT OTHER PEOPLE. WHEN THEY GET OUT [inaudible] B. [inaudible] PORT. THERE ARE MORE TRANSITIONAL. THEN THERE HAVE BEEN AT BUT THERE AREN'T NEARLY ENOUGH. AND MOST OF THEM DON'T HAVE. WHAT WE SEE IS PEOPLE AREN'T? THEY DON'T. BUT THEY ALSO ARE. A ALL. PRIVATE. DEALING WITH THE PRESS -- FIGURE OUT HOW TO THE BUS. SEE THE ROLE IT. THAT CAN KNOCK SOMEBODY OUT FOR A WHOLE DAY. BECAUSE THEY'VE NEVER HAD TO DEAL WITH THAT AND THERE'S NOT OF YOUR SUPPORT. EVEN IF THIS IS TRUE SOMETIMES EVEN WHEN THEY'RE WHEN THEY'RE IN A TRANSITIONAL PROGRAM. WHAT DO I DO RAP? RIGHT BOTH MEN. IT MAY HAVE A SOLID JOB THEY CAN DO THAT [inaudible] BUT A LOT OF TIMES WHAT WE SEE IS LACKING IS AT OF MISSIONAL. TO DEAL WITH -- COMING BACK HOME. AND WHAT IDEA. BUT ALSO TO DEAL WITH HAVING BEEN IMPRESSED. IS THE IS THE PRISON CALLS FROM. THAT NO ONE DEAL. NO. ONE TO DEAL WITH NO ONE IS. RESOURCE THE DEAL WITH THOSE OF THE FOLKS TO GET OUT THERE. THE EIGHTY FIVE BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE THEIR THEIR POTENTIAL THERE HAS TO BE. TO REALLY DISRUPT THESE CYCLES OF VIOLENCE IN THE COMMUNITY THERE ARE CERTAIN BARRIERS. THEM DOING THAT -- AND I'M INTERESTED IN DEVELOPING MORE WAYS THE TRANSITIONAL PROGRAMS MORE ROBUST. DIFFERENT COLOR HOUSING SO THAT I BERMAN [inaudible] I AM [inaudible] ONE YOU CAN HEAR ME [inaudible] DUCK DOWN -- WONDERING -- RE ENTRY LEASE. YOU TALK ABOUT [inaudible] THANKS SORRY WHAT WHAT PEOPLE REPORT IS? YEAH I GET IN EVEN IF THE TRANSISTOR. I HAVE TO USE ALL THOSE TOOLS THAT ARE AT TO NOT YOU END TO DEAL WITH ALL THE BAD. THEY MAY BE ABLE TO THAT AND THE OVERWHELMING. BUT I'M JUST LOOKING AT LEARN IN THERE [inaudible] YOUNG. IT'S AN IMPORTANT RESTORED HEARING WHAT [inaudible] SOMEBODY [inaudible] COMING [inaudible] ROLL SYSTEM HOW IT [inaudible] BETTER SO [inaudible] NO WORRY -- MORAL I'M AT THE OKAY [inaudible] EARLY. ONCE A MONTH WE MEET IN THE ON BALK WHAT WE CALL A RE BRING THEM ALL TOGETHER [inaudible] ACES. YOU MEET MONTHLY YES THAT'S ALL [inaudible] EARLY THAT [inaudible] FIFTEEN AND WHERE THEY MEET. SO OUR OFFICE IS RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO -- NOT FAR FROM HERE WE HAVE -- PUBLIC OPEN PUBLIC BOARD MEETINGS. AND IT'S PUBLICLY NOTICED AT TOWARD TEN DAYS IN ADVANCE OF EVERY HEARING WE USUALLY MEET DURING THE MONDAY AND TUESDAY OF THE THIRD WEEK OF EVERY MONTH. WHERE ARE BASED? THEY'RE ACTUALLY OUT IN THE PRISONS SO OUR COMMISSIONERS TRAVELED EVERY PRISON THEY SPEND A WEEKEND EACH PRISON WHERE THEY'RE CONDUCTING HEARINGS -- MOST OF THEM OF EVAN HOTELS -- VERY FEW OF THEM LIVE CLOSE ENOUGH TO PRISON WHERE THEY CAN GO HOME AT NIGHT SO WE HAVE MONDAYS ARE ARE TRAVEL AND PREPARATION DAYS. SO FREQUENTLY THEY'LL HAVE A FOR A FIVE HOUR DRIVE TO GET TO WHEREVER THEY'RE GOING. AND THEY PREPARE FOR HEARINGS THEY THEN CONDUCT HEARINGS ON TUESDAYS WEDNESDAYS AND THURSDAYS AND FRIDAYS -- FRIDAYS WE HAVE ONE OR TWO LESS HEARINGS AND WE GIVE THEM TIME TO TRAVEL HOME. THEN THEY PREP EVERY NIGHT AND EVERY WEEKEND. IT IS A FULL TIME JOB. MORE THAN OF SO WHAT HAPPENS IS -- FOR MONTHS IN ADVANCE OF A PAROLE HEARING WE ASSIGNED COUNSEL WE APPOINT EVERY INMATE THEIR COUNSEL. SO THERE'S A SERIES OF INTERACTIONS. NOW THEY CAN IF THEY HAVE PRIVATE FUNDS THEY CAN HAVE A PRIVATE ATTORNEY BUT THE MOST PART. THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY. OF YES THREE WE END UP HIRING FOLKS IS SIMILAR. SO. BACK MAY DROP OUT AT SOME POINT DURING THAT FOUR MONTHS THEY MAY REQUEST A POSTPONEMENT THEY MAY -- REQUEST A WAIVER. OR THEY MAY SAY WE WANT TO STIPULATE. TO BEING UNSUITABLE. AND SO THEY MAY NOT GET ALL THE WAY TO THE END IN EACH OF THOSE CASES SO THAT'S HOW THE FEE STRUCTURE WAS ORIGINALLY. BUT TOGETHER MANY YEARS AGO. EIGHT NINE YOUR LOOK. THAT. SO ALL THESE [inaudible] BROUGHT. IRAQ I'M THERE AT WILL -- THERE'S ABOUT THIRTY NINE OF THEM STATEWIDE I BELIEVE RIGHT NOW THEY SERVE ON PANELS WHICH MEANS -- A THEY HAVE DESIGNATED INSTITUTIONS ARE WHERE THEY SAY I WANT TO REPRESENT PEOPLE IN ON ONE OF THESE PANELS. IN THOSE LOCATIONS [inaudible] IN [inaudible] WE ARE [inaudible] EIGHT LAST. IT'S BEEN ABOUT TEN YEARS. AT TEN YEARS [inaudible] WHY IT? A LOT OF REASONS -- ONE IS THAT AGAIN WE HAVE NOT HAD A RECRUITMENT PROBLEM AND WE HAVE FOUND THAT BOOKS HAVE BEEN A LITTLE. RELUCTANT TO INCREASE THAT IS IF WE HAVE WAITING LISTS OF PEOPLE THAT WANT TO SERVE ON THESE PANELS. AND THEN WHAT WE'VE DECIDED IS THAT -- IF WHAT'S DIFFERENT NOW. IS THAT WE WANT TO INCREASE THE EXPECTATIONS SO WE'RE GOING TO INCREASE THE EXPECTATIONS YOU WILL MEET WITH YOUR CLIENT X. NUMBER OF TIMES FOR X. AMOUNT OF TIME. YOU WILL -- REVIEW THE RISK ASSESSMENT WITH THEM IN DETAIL YOU WILL I'M HELP DEVELOP ROLE PLANS THINGS LIKE THAT IF WE WANT TO BUILD IN THOSE EXPECTATIONS. IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO ASK THEM TO DO THAT BASED ON THE SAME DAY -- ALMOST DOUBLE [inaudible] SEVEN YES. WE DID THAT SO WE DID THE STUDY OF WHAT OF WHAT THE OTHER COUNTIES AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE DOING. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WOULD MAKE SENSE AND SO WE ACTUALLY DID A LITTLE BIT OF ANALYSIS OF WHAT THE BREAKDOWN IS ALSO FOR APPELLATE. COUNSEL OUT OF THE CALIFORNIA PROJECT. AND THE BREAKDOWN OF DOLLARS FOR EACH LINES OF THINGS AND HOW MANY HOURS THEY CAN MAX OUT AT FOR EACH OF THOSE THINGS AND IT. IT WAS THE ONE THAT MADE MOST SENSE IT SEEMED TO KIND OF ACTUALLY DID IT IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS WHERE WE THE CALIFORNIA APPELLATE PROJECT. THE SCHEDULE AND SAT DOWN AND SAID OKAY IF YOU'RE DOING A PRO HEARING. WHAT'S ANALOGOUS IN HIM UP WITH A NUMBER THE MEANTIME OTHER STAFF ACTUALLY IT THE WHOLE SURVEY WITH THE OTHER COUNTIES AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WHEN WE ARRIVED AT THE SAME NUMBER HE SAID I MUST BE HAD? SO WE'RE OPEN FOR YOU KNOW ADDITIONAL IF SOMEBODY HAS OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS BUT WE THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS THE MOST ANALOGOUS TO US. AND IT'S SOME FRAMEWORK THIS IS A VERY UNIQUE AREA OF THE LAW WE DON'T WE COULDN'T FIND TOO MANY OTHER. PEOPLE OR ENTITIES THAT DO THIS THE WHERE WE COULD. IN WHAT THEY DO AND UP BY US SO. THAT WAS THE BEST WE COULD COME UP WITH IF SOMEBODY HAS OTHER IDEAS WERE OPEN [inaudible] BOB -- HE FOR MAC. YOU'RE IN A WORD THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA WORK [inaudible] YOU HAVE [inaudible] BRIAN [inaudible] WELL MAYBE. I'M GOING I'M [inaudible] BILLABLE HOURS [inaudible] GOING. WHAT WE WERE PLANNING? NOW IS THE WAY -- TO I WILL SAY I MEAN YES I THINK THAT YOUR CRACK THE ONE A DAHLE AGE THAT THAT THAT IS LIKELY GOING TO HAPPEN I WILL TELL YOU THAT THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE THAT. OPERATE IN THIS ARENA OR MANY OF THE PRIVATE COUNSEL THAT WOULD PROBABLY TAKE THIS ON IF. THESE WERE INCREASED A BIT AND IT WAS MORE FINANCIALLY -- ACCEPTABLE TO THEM [inaudible] I'M. THEY REALLY WANT TO DO THIS WORK IT'S A CALLING FOR THEM THIS IS NOT. THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF PERSON THAT IS IN IT FOR THE MONEY. AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT'S NECESSARILY A THING [inaudible] BE HONEST [inaudible] OTHER. ABOUT A LOT COOLER WEATHER. THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS -- WHY? IT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION -- WE WE HAVEN'T LOOKED AT IT LETTING GO THIS FAR IS THE WHAT. INCREASED BE SCHEDULE FOR MORE EXPERIENCED ATTORNEYS I WILL TELL YOU SOME OF THE FOLKS OF THE BEST THAT REPRESENTING INMATES OF THE ONES THAT ARE STILL IN LAW SCHOOL. WE'VE BEEN FANTASTIC. SO YOU DO GET SOME PEOPLE THAT ARE VERY VERY EAGER AND VERY. SHARP AND THIS IS NOT I NEVER. IT'S NOT A REALLY COMPLICATED FROM A PROCEDURAL STANDPOINT BUT OF LEGAL ARENA IT'S AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING. AND SO IN SOME RESPECTS. YOU KNOW MAYBE THEY SHOULDN'T BE A FULL TIME JOB FOR PEOPLE MAYBE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SUPPLEMENTS A PATH -- THEIR PRACTICE AND THAT IS SOMETHING THEY REALLY WANT TO DO IT'S VERY FULFILLING WORK I THINK THE PEOPLE THAT THEY DO IT. SO I'M HOPING [inaudible] AT IBM [inaudible] LAST [inaudible] FALL. RIGHT WHAT WHAT. WHAT NUMBER? IT'S NOT TOO FAR FROM -- BEARS IN. IN MY STUDENTS [inaudible] REPRESENT. THE TO WORK WITH THEM. FOR YOU'RE A LONGER. ADVANCE THAT HEARING. AND THEY'RE A SUCCESS RESPECT THEM BETTER THAN MINE. THERE REALLY COMMITTED TO IT. MIGHT GET A LOT OUT OF IT. THEY SPEND A LOT MORE TIME. YOU MENTIONED YOU KNOW YOU FURTHER WHAT I THOUGHT BY THE AMOUNT OF TIME. I WANT TO WEAR BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT IT. IT'S JUST ABOUT EVERYBODY. YOU KNOW THAT. THE WORK THEY WERE DOING IS ESPECIALLY HIRES. WE'RE ASKING THEM. TO FORCIBLY [inaudible] MOMENT BY. AND WE'RE WE'RE ASKING TO DO THIS. IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS BUILT. TO OF IS BUILT TO OR OR AT LEAST. THE WAY TO THE IT REQUIRES THEM. THAT'S THE HIGHEST LEVEL. AND THAT ALSO MEANS [inaudible] ACKNOWLEDGING [inaudible] E.. OWN ABILITIES WE AND THEY'VE SPENT DECADES [inaudible] FIVE TEAMS TEAM. MA'AM THE BLACK TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE THE THING THEIR MOST BREDA. THE MOST PAINFUL HISTORIES MEMBERS. WHEN THEY COME INTO THE TO THE VISITING ROOM WITH ME OR MY AND MY TEAM? THEY HAVE TO REMOVE THAT ARMOR. AND LET THEMSELVES BE SEEN. FOR THE TWO HOURS AWAY TO GET. AN EXPRESSIVE HIRES. WHERE THEY'RE NOT GOING OUT INTO A MORE SUPPORTIVE THERAPEUTIC COMMUNITY AT THE END OF OUR MEETING? YOU CAN ALMOST PHYSICALLY SEE THEM WITH THEIR ARMOR BACKBONE. GO OUT. TO BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY CAN'T BE RAW OUT CAN BE VULNERABLE. AND IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO STEP BACK. SOMEONE. MUST TO IN THAT WAY. AND AND WE HAVE A MAJOR OBLIGATION ALL THAT [inaudible] PROTECT. SO THE WE'RE NOT OPEN UP. ROOMS THAT ARE GOING TO GET THEM. IT TAKES A WHILE TO DIFFERENT PROCESSES BY SAID IT'S MUCH MORE PRONOUNCED THANK. ORDER. THEN JUST PLUG IT IN IT EARLY. AND WHAT HEARING. I LOOK FORWARD. TO EXPANDING THE ROLE OF WORK. THAT NECK WITH [inaudible] HE ASK [inaudible] I'M PLEASED. THERE'S NO SUPPORT BY THE PRESENT ACT. THE BILL WEST -- UNDER MORE LIKE YOU HAVE ANY OTHER. BUT ANY OF THE FOUR FOUR OR FIVE ITEMS RELATED TO THIS ITEM. RIGHT SO I AM GOING TO ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YOU ARE WE DIDN'T WANT THEM WAY IN YET GO AHEAD. MADAM CHAIR JUST NAY NEWMAN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I JUST TOOK OVER. AN IMPEDIMENT FIVE BROADER THAN THAT. WE BELIEVE THAT BY PROVIDING ADDITIONAL. AND THAT NOT ONLY ARE WE GOING TO INCREASE NUMBER HEARINGS THAT ARE HEARD. THE EXPECTATION IS THAT. YOU TO FINDING CANCELLATION. POSTPONEMENTS WILL GET CLOSER TO THAT 39% OR SO GRANT RATE IT ACTUALLY COMES ABOUT WHEN. I'VE GOT. YOUR CASE I'M WE ARE ACCEPTING AGAIN LIMITED EDITION. FIRST TWO YEARS AND CORRECTIONAL HELP. AN INMATE I'M [inaudible] FOR THEM. AS TO THE MAY BE SCHEDULED BET OR PROCURING. ON THAT IN THE END NINE COUNTIES AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE AVERAGE ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY DOLLARS PER CASE. WHY WE BELIEVE IT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLAR FEE IS REASONABLE? FORWARD WE ALSO WANT TO GET AHEAD OF MANY BUILDING. THERE WE ARE THINKING ABOUT. PROVIDING ADEQUATE [inaudible] ALTHOUGH [inaudible] THIS. OVERALL PROPOSAL IS NOT ONLY LOOKING AT YOU WITH AN INCREASE IN BACKLOG IN THOSE THE HAVE TO MOLD EQUIPMENT YOU NEED EXPERT BARRED LIST OF ANY CHANGES WE MAKE BUT IT'S UNCLEAR. AND SO YOU KNOW I NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT BETTER AS I HE IS [inaudible] HI. TO A NEW. COOL THAT'S GOING TO BE USED. IN THE PROCESS BEGAN A ONE IT SO. I'M GONNA NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT BETTER. AND IS IT SAYS HE IS GOING PROCESS INCREASINGLY COMPLEX. IN OBVIOUS YES WE HAVE A POOL OF ALL LOT MORE [inaudible] HEARINGS. BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME WHETHER. FROM WHEN I READ. HE YOU KNOW ARE WE IN NEW SOFTWARE WE TALKING. AIDED. BUT MEN. AROUND THE NEAR BRING ME NOW WOULD LIKE. AND THAT BETTER [inaudible] ADDITIONALLY HE BUT YOU KNOW IT'S PRETTY CLEAR [inaudible] FROM THE FROM WHAT I KNOW THAT. BOTH THE VOTERS IN THE LEGISLATURE HAS DONE. THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE AN INCREASED NUMBER OF AIRINGS EVERY YEAR THAT. THAT MIGHT BE THE ARGUMENT HOWEVER [inaudible] WHAT? NO THIS GONNA JUMP BY ANY MEANS. I'M LOW'S ADD A LOT MORE PERMANENT EVE BUT WE'RE HAVING A LOT MORE HEARING. I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING. THE ROLE OF TEMPORARY HE IS IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A REDUCTION. IN HERE. I CAN UNLESS OF COURSE BE ACHIEVED A BETTER RATE. OF THE APPROVAL FOR PAROLE BUT I CAN EXPLAIN THAT PROBABLY QUITE QUICKLY I'M FOR AN INITIAL HEARING. AN INMATE INITIAL HEARING COUNSELORS HAVE TO WHAT WE ASK THEM TO DO THE DUTY THAT THEY CARRY OUT THE BOARD. IS TO SUMMARIZE THE OFFENDERS ENTIRE CENTRAL FILE SO WHEN THEY BEEN DOWN. FOR ALL RIGHT WHEN THEY'VE BEEN INCARCERATED FOR TEN OR TWENTY YEARS. IT'S AN ENORMOUS BACK FILE OF INFORMATION THEY SUMMARIZE FOR US. IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS BECAUSE OF THE EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN HUNDRED YOU KNOW THAT. WE HAVE THE INFLUX OF THE BUBBLE. DUE TO THE COURT CASE AND THE YOUTH OFFENDERS IN PARTICULAR WHERE WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO SEE FAR MORE INITIAL HEARINGS OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT TWO YEARS THEN WE WILL THEREAFTER. SO THEY'RE JUST ASKING FOR SOME TEMPORARY -- POSITIONS TO HANDLE BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S GONNA TAKE MORE TIME FOR THOSE COUNSELORS TO HANDLE THESE CASES RIGHT [inaudible] SO. THAT. IS. A DECENT EXPLANATION THOUGH I'M NOT SURE IT EXPLAINS IT OR ARE. ELEVEN LIMITED NINETEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY ONE LIMITED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUT WHATEVER -- AND THEN THE ADDITIONAL. WHAT I HOPE WHAT IT IS BUT SOMETHING MORE ON THIS VISION MAKING [inaudible] YEAH. ALL RIGHT I'M -- BUT THERE ARE OTHER QUESTIONS WILL GO TO OUR NEXT ITEM IS WIDELY -- SORRY PUBLIC COMMENT. IS THERE PUBLIC PROMINENCE BY YEAH [inaudible] THE I AM AN INMATE IN FAMILY ADMIT IT. I ALSO HAVE A HAS BEEN INCARCERATED IN WHEN IT. ONE OF THE PRESIDENT. BILL MY ISSUE IS -- CCAR'S. NOT NECESSARILY THE PAROLE BOARD BUT CDC ARE IN GENERAL IS ASKING. FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDS -- BUT IN TODAY'S BUSINESS I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE HEARD OF A GLADIATOR FIGHTS THAT ARE GOING ON SO THEY'RE PROMOTING AND BEATING VIOLENCE AND THESE REASONS. AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY ALL THE WILL NOT ALL BUT SOME OF THE GUYS IN THERE ARE LOSING THEIR PAROLE THEIR PAROLE DATE. BECAUSE WITH THE NEW PROGRAM THE NON DESIGNATED PROGRAMMING FACILITY THERE ANY GRADING SO WHY POPULATIONS ANGIE. ELECTIONS WOULD HAVE WHICH HAVE BEEN SEPARATED FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS. STILL THAT'S BEATING VIOLENCE AMONG THE INMATES IN THE LOWER LEVEL FACILITIES AND MOST OF THESE -- INTEGRATIONS ARE HAPPILY HAPPENING AT THE LOWER LEVEL FACILITIES WHERE THEY'RE LIKE EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF COMING HOME. IN FOR EXAMPLE AN ORIGINAL TRAINING FACILITY IN DECEMBER. THERE WAS AN INMATE THAT WAS COMING HOME IN TWO WEEKS. BUT A HUGE RATE OCCURRED IN HIS FACILITY BECAUSE OF THIS MERGER AND NOW HE'S SITTING IN THE HOLE IN THE IN A FACILITY FACING ATTEMPTED MURDER CHARGES. SO THE DA WILL POSSIBLY EITHER PICK IT UP OR NOT IS JUST WAITING FOR THAT. SO YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY AFFECTING THESE GLADIATOR FIGHTS THESE EMERGES NOTONLY WITH THE NON DESIGNATED PROGRAMMING FACILITY -- THAT. THAT CDC ARE CREATED LAST YEAR BUT ALSO INCREMENTAL RELEASES THERE ARE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY STATE BUSINESS RIGHT NOW WHERE DID YOU SEE OUR IS. KNOWINGLY PLACING KNOWN ENEMIES OUT IN THE YARD OR STAY LOOTED AREAS LIKE JIM AREA AND MAKING ON BY. ALL THESE INCIDENTS -- MA'AM YOU STATED THAT YOU KNOW WHEN THE FOR THEIR THEIR PAROLE HEARINGS. THE IF THEY GET THE NIGHT OF THE YEAR DIALING EIGHT MONTHS IN MY ROLE. BUT WITHIN THOSE EIGHTEEN MONTHS IN THEIR PLACE AND ONE OF THESE DISABILITIES. THEY'RE ACTING IN SELF DEFENSE AND AND HAVE TO FIGHT FOR THEIR LIVES. AND NOW THEY GET A ONE FOR BEING AN AGGRESSOR AND THEY'RE LOSING THOSE STATE THEN THEY'RE LOSING THEIR CHANCES I'M HOME AND YOU KNOW ALL THIS VIOLENCE THAT SEAT IS YOURS CREATING A IT'S JUST. YOU KNOW ALL THESE BILLS ARE PASSING TO THEIR LOVED ONES HOME AND ALL THESE BILLS ARE PASSING TO THEIR LOVED ONES HOME. AND ALL THESE LIGHTS IN ALL THESE GLADIATOR. I'M SORRY. OUR LOVED ONES ARE IN. MENTAL AND THEY'RE THEY'RE MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY DRAINED. YOU KNOW AND ALL THESE. ALL THIS VIOLENCE AT CDC OR IS CREATING IN THE PRISON SYSTEM TODAY IS JUST -- THEIR CHANCES ARE PART OF COMING HOME -- LIMITED. YOU KNOW AND IT'S THEIR DRAINED WHERE THEY DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE THE ONES CHOSEN TODAY. TO GO OUT AND FIGHT THEY DON'T KNOW OF THEIR LIFE IS GOING TO BE PLACED IN DANGER. THEY DON'T KNOW -- IF THERE THEY GO TO THEIR COMMITTEE AND THE BEFORE THEY WANTED TO GO TO A LOWER LEVEL SO THEY CAN GO TO PAROLE AND SAY YOU LOOK I'M DOING GOOD I'M PROGRAMMING. BUT RIGHT NOW NOWADAYS YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO THEY DON'T WANT TO GO TO A LOWER PRISON BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID. ALL THE LEVEL ONE PRISONS NOW ARE NON DESIGNATED PROGRAMMING FACILITY THE LEADER IN OUR MOVEMENT HER HUSBAND WAS PLACED. IN A NON DESIGNATED PROGRAMMING FACILITY IN RG DONOVAN LAST MONTH. THREE TIMES THREE INCIDENTS HE WAS BEING BRUTALLY ATTACKED LESSONS BASS LESSEN THE NECK. AND HIS HE WAS A LEVEL ONE MINUS NEGATIVE TWENTY TWO POINTS. I MEAN. AND IT IS FOR PAROLE MAKE YOU NEED IF YOU IS GONNA COME HOME IN MAY BUT HE WAS PLACED IN HIS YARD. AND BRUALLY ATTACKED. YOU KNOW SO ALL THE SO. YOU KNOW I I WON OUR LOVED ONES TO COME HOME AND BUT THE VIOLENCE THAT'S BEING CREATED INSIDE THE PRISONS IT'S LIMITING THEIR OPTIONS -- ACTUALLY LET YOU GUYS KNOW I AM DOING GOOD AND PROGRAMMING YOU KNOW BE HIS BILL SEE ALL THESE. ONE MEANS AND YOU KNOW AND HAVE AN ALL STATE PRISON THE THE GENTLEMAN -- THAT. THERE IS THERE A FEAR FOR THEIR LIVES. THEY SAID I'M NOT GONNA PROGRAM BECAUSE I I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GONNA BE ATTACKED. THEY WERE WRITTEN UP BECAUSE THE RE USE THE GOAL THE OTHER YARD TO GO TO THE EAST THE YARD. AND THEN THE WERE RAIN UP AGAIN AND LABELED AS THE PROGRAM. AND NOW TO WRITE UPS IN THREE MONTHS THEY'RE BEING PLACED ON THE STATUS. AND AND LABELED AS PROGRAM. SO YOU KNOW ALL ALL THESE YOU KNOW. THE BOTTOM LINE -- WE JUST. WOULD LIKE CDC ARE TO FOLLOW THEIR MISSION STATEMENT OF THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF OUR LOVED ONES. AND THEY WERE PROGRAMMING FINE BEFORE IT THE NON DESIGNATED PROGRAM ESPECIALLY ON BEFORE THE INCREMENTAL RELEASES. YOU KNOW THAT THAT THE STATE IS NOW CREATING YOU KNOW SO. NOW THEY DON'T LOOK GOOD IN THE EYES OF THE PAROLE BOARD AND THEIR CHANCES OF COMING HOME HAVE DIMINISHED. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ANY OTHER PUBLIC ON ALL RIGHT.

REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS AND THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT -- YOU KNOW THESE PROGRAMS WORK. AND YOU KNOW AND MAYES I'M HOME. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS THAT BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW THESE -- ACTRESSES THAT ARE CURRENTLY AND IN PLAYS THESE POOR PRACTICES. YOU KNOW INMATES HAVE BEEN DENIED. OF PROGRAMMING SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS ARE AWARE BUT IN PARTICULARLY -- AND I SPEAK OF CTF BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE MY LOVE WHEN IS -- THEY HAVEN'T BEEN PROGRAMMING FOR SIX MONTHS.

GIVEN THE RUN AROUND THERE IS NOTHING YOU KNOW IN PLACE THERE IS NO COMMUNICATION THERE IS NO INFORMATION. IF ANYTHING IS GONNA YOU KNOW HAPPEN OR CHANGE AND OUR LOVED ONES ARE DESPERATE BECAUSE AS AS YOU KNOW MY PARTNER MENTIONED. THIS IS THE LOWER LEVEL. AND MOST OF THESE INMATES ARE GETTING READY FOR BOARD SO MORE THAN YOU KNOW ATTORNEY REPRESENTATION MORE THAN. YOU KNOW. PSYCHOLOGICAL HELP COUNSELING HELP OR WHATEVER THESE FOLKS NEED TO BE READY. TO COME UP TO COME OUT TO THE REAL WORLD AND AND YOU KNOW BE ABLE TO FUNCTION OUT IN SOCIETY -- WITHOUT THESE. SERVICES AND WITH YOU KNOW. THEIR RIGHTS BEING VIOLATED. AND YOU KNOW.

PROCESS WORK AND EVERYTHING IT IT'S UP. RIGHT MEANS THAT THESE TYPE OF PRACTICES THEY'RE TAKING BASED IN THE PRISONS -- FOR EXAMPLE OF THE MENTION THE VIOLENCE AND EVERYTHING THAT THEY ARE. BEING AS THESE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO REHABILITATE AND REENTER SOCIETY -- BUT ANOTHER THING THAT I THINK. REALLY BEEN -- EXPLORED AT EVEN AS THE AS A WORKER THERE I WORK FOR THE COUNTY OF ANGELES. OFFICERS BETTER IN THAT. THERE ARE ALSO AT RISK. BECAUSE OF THIS POOR IMPLEMENTATION I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S PROBABLY. FOR BUDGETARY REASONS.

THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING AND SHARING YOUR EXPERIENCES THAN INFORMING. RIGHT. SO WE WILL MOVE ON OUR NEXT ITEM ANYONE ELSE. RIGHT SO ARE OTHER. NEVER KNOW THE WHILE THEY MAY NOT GO TO THE LEAD ACID REPLACEMENT -- IT'S A SEC WAITING FROM THOSE -- REQUEST WE JUST TALKED ABOUT -- TO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW IS CARS ACTUALLY. THE NEXT ITEM IS A REQUEST FOR TWENTY FOUR MILLION GENERAL FUND AND OR POSITION. THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY AND I'M GOING TO ESTABLISH A SEVEN YEAR SCHEDULED. FOR REPLACEMENT OF OUR CRITICAL WEEK. THIS PROPOSAL WE HAVE BEEN USING EIGHT MILLION. FROM OUR BASE SUB. VISION OF AN OLD INSTITUTION BUDGET. FOR WE REPLACEMENT WE WILL. CONTINUE TO DO THAT FOR A TOTAL OF THIRTY TWO MILLION. WITH ME TODAY IS DEVON FONG WHO IS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF BUSINESS. AND NOW -- IN ADVANCE. GONNA BE WHY DO YOU NEED. GET IT BY WE NEED. YEAH. WHAT'S YOUR OUT TELL ME THAT WE'RE GONNA BE LIKE DOUBLING THE NUMBER OF VEHICLES I DON'T KNOW WHY WE NEED. MORE PEOPLE [inaudible] AFTERNOON -- SENATORS. CITIES ARE GRADUATES APPROXIMATELY 1-002-800-0800 AND THIRTY FIVE CENTS YOU SHINS AND FORTY SEVEN CONSERVATION CAMP. DID YOU SEE OUR AS A LEADER OF APPROXIMATELY. SIX THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR ON ASK. THESE ASSETS OR TO PROVIDE SUPPORT. FIRE WASTE DISPOSAL -- SERVICE PLAN OPTIONS. CDC ARE DOES NOT HAVE A DEDICATED FUNDING. MECHANISM FOR US THAT REPLACEMENT. LEAD ACID REPLACEMENT. A CDC ARE AS WANTON MENTIONED UTILIZED THE A. I. PROGRAM BUDGET. TO REPLACE ASSETS PREVIOUSLY. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD HELP US BETTER MANAGE OUR LEAD. AND WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A BASELINE DATA SO THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY SOME POTENTIAL. SAVINGS IN THE IN THE UPCOMING YEAR. APPROXIMATELY FIFTY TWO HUNDRED OF CDC OURS ASSETS MEET. YES RUSH HOLT FOR REPLACEMENT WHICH IS ABOUT SEVENTY SUMMER. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO I WITH THIS PROPOSAL IS REPLACE OVER SEVEN YEAR PERIOD OUR BACKLOG? OF ASSETS OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY ASSETS. I WHICH IS ABOUT SIX THOUSAND I'M SORRY THREE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX ASSETS THEY'RE CONSIDERED HIGH PRIORITY. WITH SMOOTH THEM OUT OVER SEVEN YEAR PERIOD. I WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY STANDARDS. AND THAT WOULD ALSO -- ENABLES US TO AVOID SOME HUGE SPIKES AND AND BUDGET. PARABLE OF REPLACING YOUR OWN. TWO CARS AND ONE YEAR. BUT AMOUNTS DO NOT REPLACING ALL OF THE ASSETS. MONTHLY TWO THOUSAND OF OUR ASSETS ARE ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY YEARS OLD TO ABOUT 20% OF OUR ASSETS TWENTY YEARS OLD. AND THE AVERAGE AGE OF OUR IN YOUR THERE. REALLY OLD AND OUT [inaudible] SO -- REPLACING THESE. IF NOT REPLACE THESE DOESN'T WHICH IS A RISK. OUR ABILITY TO PERFORM A MISSION CRITICAL FUNCTIONS. OF POTENTIALLY JEOPARDIZING THE EMPLOYEES MADE. THE ARM IN IN RESPONSE TO THE THE NEED FOR THE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS. WE WOULD BE GOING FROM OUR CURRENT SPEND IS ABOUT. FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS -- AND SO TO THE OR POSITIONS WOULD BE GOING TOWARDS -- COMPLETING THE PROCUREMENT SO THAT ARE OFF NON OFF ON TRACK TO WILL BE GOING FROM ABOUT FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS TO THIRTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS WE'RE ADDING. TWO MORE STAFF AND OUR OPPOSITION -- UNIT GOING FROM FIVE TO SEVEN TO RIGHT NOW. FIVE COMPLETE ABOUT FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS AND WE WOULD GOING TO THIRTY TWO MILLION -- WITH. SEVEN HELLO ON THE FLEET MANAGEMENT SIDE. ARE THE NEED FOR THAT IS TO REALLY AND LOOK AT OUR UTILIZATION DATA. THEY WOULD ALSO BE LOOKING AT THE DATA MANAGEMENT WITH IN THE INSTITUTIONS TALK ABOUT REDIRECTION SOMETHING THAT WE DID LAST YEAR WITH THE HELP -- ASSET -- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THAT? HE AND ALSO TALKING ABOUT AN OUNCE MEANT TO OUR SYSTEM OF RECORD AND A SAFETY. I'M PUTTING AN ADDITIONAL BILLS TO IDENTIFY. THE WORK AS FAR AS REMOVAL OF THE ASSET FROM OUR SYSTEM THE REGISTRATION OF THE SYSTEM. SURVEYING OUT THE OLD ASSETS AND WE AND THAT IN PART. THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE'LL BE USING THE FOR HELLO. THANK YOU MA'AM. WE THINK THAT A MORE FREQUENT REPLACEMENT OF VEHICLES AT THE ART OF BEST AN OVERALL STRATEGY MINIMIZE THE COST OF OWNERSHIP. DOES SEEM REASONABLE AND BY THAT I MEAN A STRATEGY WHERE VEHICLES ARE SOLD AT THE POINT WHEN THE WHEN THEY'RE INCREASE THEIR ANNUAL CARE AND FUEL COSTS ARE. TO EAT AT THEIR ANNUAL. ASIAN. AND THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH BEST PRACTICES IN FLEET MANAGEMENT AS WELL AS THE DIRECTION THAT DEGAS HAD DIRECTED. DEPARTMENT. EIGHT I'M AND I UNDERSTAND TO BE THE OVER ARCHING PROMISED BEHIND THIS. PROPOSAL -- BUT WE DO HAVE TWO CONCERNS WITH. THE SPECIFIC TO THE PROPOSAL THE FIRST IS THAT AS I MENTIONED IT'S ABSURD PREMISE ON THE NOTION OF A NUMBER. OF BATON. ACHIEVING SAVINGS IN VEHICLE YOU'LL MAINTENANCE REPAIR AND RESELL -- BUT THE PROPOSAL DOES NOT FOR THOSE SAVINGS IT IN OTHER WORDS IT ONLY ACCOUNT FOR THE INCREASED COST OF PURCHASING VEHICLES MORE REGULARLY BUT DOESN'T ACCOUNT. FOR WHAT WE THINK WOULD BE LIKELY REDUCTION IN REPAIR MAINTENANCE BETTER FROM HAVING A YOUNGER WE ALL ALL ALL TOGETHER. I CAN'T I'M GIVEN THE WAY THAT IS. THAT THESE PLANS ARE SCHEDULED OUT IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET BELT IT APARTMENT WOULD BE ABLE TO RE DIRECT MONEY TO OTHER PURPOSES -- IF IT DID THIS IT WOULD -- AND INCREASED FUEL MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR [inaudible] WE WAIT. OLDER ON AVERAGE. AND SO WE RECOMMEND THAT REQUIRING CDC ARE TO ASK ME EVENINGS AND VEHICLE MAINTENANCE OR REPAIR. OF FUEL AND RETAIL VALUES. WOULD LIKELY BE ACHIEVED UNDER THE PROPOSAL. THEN WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REDUCE THE DEPARTMENT BUDGET BY THAT AMOUNT. AND IMPROVE THE THIRTY TWO MILLION IN A SEPARATE APPROPRIATION OF THAT THE ARMY CAN'T RE DIRECT. ARE SAID. AND IF THE VCR IS UNABLE TO ESTIMATE AIMING WERE HAPPY. IT'S BEEN DOING. AM I WANT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE MARINE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- IN REGARDS ELYAS COMMENTS ON THE SAVINGS. WE WANT TO KNOW THE DEPARTMENT HAS DEFERRED MUCH THE MAIN AND SONS EXISTING FLEET ARE VERY LONG TIME TO THE LIMITED RESOURCES AVAILABLE. WE EXPECT ANY READ EFFICIENCIES IN THAT AREA WOULD BE REDIRECTED INTO A BETTER AND MORE FREQUENT MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR. OF THE ENTIRE FLEET. AND IF I COULD JUST ONE MORE NOTE RIGHT ON ALEJO'S. RECOMMENDATION OF KIND OF TRACKING THE SPENDING WE DID THAT PART OF THE PROPOSAL PUT IT IN ITS OWN. LINE WE PROVIDE STAKEHOLDERS AND THE LEGISLATURE. AND OTHER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALL WE ARE ENDING AND WE'D BE HAPPY TO REPORT ON ALL RIGHT I'M. AND I HAVE YOUR WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A MINUTE OUR MODEL. MAINTENANCE REPAIR YOU'LL SO WE CAN IDENTIFY AND DEVELOP A REALLY GOOD BASS LINE SO WE CAN IDENTIFY SOME. POTENTIAL SAVINGS. WE JUST THAT. A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND. LEAD MANAGEMENT AND ACQUISITIONS USED TO BE A DECENTRALIZED PROCESS WASN'T UP IN. FOUR YEARS AGO I WAS BROUGHT UP AT QUARTER TO THE MANAGER. REPORTERS PERSPECTIVE SO WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF LOOKING AT THE DATA. THE DATA IS LEE -- AN EXAMPLE IS MORE COME OUT YOU'LL USE IT. THE BILL BEING USED FOR A BOILER OR IF ALL WHEN THE PROCESS BY IDENTIFYING AND AND BEING ABLE TO TRACK. ALL RIGHT SO WE'RE NOT ACTING ON THIS BUT I AM I'M STILL. NOT CONVINCED ABOUT THE NEED OR FTP I DO APPRECIATE THE THE CHANGING OF HOW WE BUDGET. FOR THE I'M. OR PLACEMENT AND ALSO. DELETE AT HAVING THAT ON A MORE. MATIC PLACEMENT SCHEDULE BUT EAT SO [inaudible] A IT INTO THAT. MORE LATER IN. RIGHT SO. FOR NOW. OF PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS SIDE OF RIGHT WE WILL NOW MOVE TO ISSUE AN ON THE COUNSELING FOR MIDDLE JUSTICE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. UNIT. AND I KNOW THAT IN ADDITION -- TO TO BE DIRECTOR ONCE IN THE WORLD WILL BE RETURNING. YEAH OUR FINAL REQUEST IS FOR FOUR HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND AND FOUR POSITIONS -- IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND I'M GOING. AND THREE NINE THOUSAND FOR A ONE TIME CONTRACT FUNDING TO EXPAND THE RESEARCH CAPACITY. ON THE UP FOR THE COUNCIL ON MIDDLE JUSTICE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND AS YOU SAID. WITH ME IS STEPHANIE WELCH THE HI GOOD AFTERNOON I'M. THEY WILL JUST ASSUME BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IS EIGHT TWELVE MEMBER. ALL. BY THE SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. AND ALSO REPRESENTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS AND THE DEPARTMENT. OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. REMAINED IN OF A REMAINING APPOINTEES ARE -- AN INTERSECTION OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND TO PROMOTE DIVERSION SPEND. TEN THAT THAT BEHAVIOR HEALTH PART DEBT IS PROBATION SHEETS PAPER HEALTH DIRECTORS. AND AND INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE IN THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. THE COUNCIL ITSELF IS CHARGED WITH IDENTIFYING INVESTIGATING AND PROMOTING. BEST PRACTICES IN THE FIELDS OF MENTION VERSION AND RE ENTRY FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF TRYING TO KEEP PEOPLE WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. OUR WE ARE PRIMARILY A POLICY BASED COUNCIL WE DEVELOP A LEGISLATIVE REPORT EVERY YEAR THE AND THE LEGISLATURE AND FOCUS ON ISSUES THAT DOES OUT OF HOUSING STRATEGIES FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE RETURNING HOME. FROM PRISON AND JAILS AND CORRECTIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES [inaudible] I'M. THE EXCITING THING ABOUT BEING ABLE TO ADD. IT'D BE THIRTY THAT YOU ARE COUNCIL IS HAVING THE ABILITY TO NOT ONLY DO OUR OWN RESEARCH -- BUT TO BASE OUR WORK -- IN A RESEARCH RIBBON AND DATA DRIVEN. WHAT THE PROPOSAL WILL ALLOW US TO DO IS TO DEVELOP -- A COMPETITIVE ARE IF HE OR A ONE I'M ON TRACK. THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO DEVELOP A STATEWIDE MONITORING BRAIN WORK. AND THAT FRAMEWORK BASICALLY WOULD IDENTIFY BOTH PUBLICLY FACING AS WELL AS NON PUBLICLY PASTING DATABASES. THAT CAN GIVE US AND PROVIDE AS INDICATORS OF WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE MAKING APPROPRIATE INVESTMENT THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH BEST PRACTICES PREVENTION. SO IN SHORT IT WILL GIVE US A LITMUS TEST OF THE STATE'S INVESTMENT IS SEE IF WE'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK. I'M STILL TRYING TO DIVERT PEOPLE WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH IT IS. INCARCERATION. THE STAFF THAT ARE REQUESTED. NOT ONLY WILL DEVELOP THE R. E. AND AND MANAGE THAT PROCESS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY. THEY WILL BE ABLE TO MANAGE THE FRAMEWORK POPULATE THE FRAMEWORK. IN HOPES OF CREATING A ON A STATE LEVEL LIKE DASHBOARD -- IT WOULD HELP US IDENTIFY FOR EXAMPLE -- IF WE SEE A SPIKE. IN LOOKING AT VITAL STATISTICS THAT PEOPLE ARE AND TIME BY -- OVERDOSE OR THEY'RE ENTERING INTO JAHRES. M. THIRTY DAYS AFTER RELEASE WE MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT THAT IT PROVIDES AS INDICATION OF WHERE WE AS A COUNCIL. TO DIVE DEEPER INTO CRITICAL. RIGHT NOW -- WE HAVE AN ARRAY OF STAKEHOLDERS. I'M THAT. ASK AT LOOK AT CERTAIN USED. THIS WOULD ALLOW US TO ALSO USE DATA. TO HELP US DETERMINE WHAT ISSUES WE WANT TO LOOK AT I'M FINALLY I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS THE AN ADDITIONAL BENEFIT FROM THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT. I HAVE BEEN A RESEARCH SIGN. THE SUPPORTING RESEARCH SCIENTIST. ONE WE CAN ACTUALLY -- STAFFING CONTINUE WORK GUARDED. WHICH IS WITH COUNTY RESEARCHERS AND UP AND THESE ARE RESEARCHERS WERE BOTH. EXCITED WELL AS THE HEALTH SIDE. REALLY IDENTIFY BARRIERS. AND THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT HAS TO BENEFITS ONE OF COURSE IS JUST AIR. THESE PEOPLE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO TRANSITION FOR A LOT OF SYSTEMS AND AND THE RECORDS THAT THEY HAVE. EARLY FOLLOW THEM WHEREVER THEY GO -- BUT ALSO -- IMPORTANTLY FOR RESEARCH IN A VALUATION. HAVE A BETTER SENSE I'M. OF WHICH PROGRAMS ARE ACTUALLY WORKING. PEOPLE PERMITS THAT IS THAT. WE WERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO GET SOME RESOURCES IN THE BUDGET A COUPLE YEARS AGO. AND HE LAUNCHED A MEDICAL UTILITY RIGHT THAT. AND RIGHTLY THAT PROJECT ALLOWS US TO MATCH -- INFORMATION FROM THE ART MEDICAL DATABASE. TO WHETHER OR NOT INDIVIDUALS EXITING. WE ARE ARE UTILIZING THEIR MEDICAL BENEFIT AT WHAT EXTENT ARE THEY DOING IT OUTPATIENT SETTING ARE THEY DOING TO MANAGE ON A MISSION. AND I THINK THAT THAT WHOLE PROJECT. A LOT ABOUT HOW WE NEED TO DEDICATE. MY MAIN REASON IS THE BETTER-UNDERSTANDING THE BARRIERS TO DATA SHARING. AND SO IT'LL BE REALLY HELPFUL TO HAVE A PERSON AND TO LEAVE THAT WORK GROUP AND HAVE. INFORMATION NETWORK -- RIVE OUR POLICY RIGHT [inaudible] I'M BERMAN. AND YOU JUST NAY NEWMAN PARTNER FINANCE I'M ONE OF THE AND IF WE FIND IN THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT IT UTILIZING GENERAL FUND RESOURCES. WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE COUNCIL THE MORE APPROPRIATELY FOCUS ON PAROLEES ARE JUSTICE INVOLVED INDIVIDUALS AS OPPOSED A MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE ACT FUNDS WHICH IS HOW THEY HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN UNDER. I'M IN ON THE RIGHT I'M SO THE TO THE REQUEST ONE IS FOR YOUR ONE I'M ONLY WITH. RIGHT THE OTHER. ONE TIME ONLY CONTRACT THAT WOULD -- ALLOW YOU TO DO -- I THANK. YOU I AM. I'M ANYONE FOR YOU. BOTH I'M ISSUE. AND ON GO [inaudible] I'M. AND I GUESS [inaudible] IT'S HARD. WHILE THE LEGISLATORS STAFF WHICH UNIT I DON'T HAVE ANY THE UNIT [inaudible] IT'S EIGHT DOWN. WELL THIS BY BROTHER ARBITRATE ASK WORK. AND IF I LOOK AT ALL RIGHT. IF WE LOOK AT ALL UNTIL RESEARCH NEED. THAT THE NECESSARY DURING THAT WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND OAKS. THAT WE HOLD IN OUR STATE. AT THE MOMENT AND VERY LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE ON ROLE. I AND WE HAVE THIS HIGH RECIDIVISM RATE. YOU KNOW IF I WERE AN ACADEMIC AND I WOULD BE STARTING YOU. IDENTIFY A SERIES OF RESEARCH THAT MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE HELP US UNDERSTAND OR MANAGE ANY OF THIS. YOU KNOW JUST BY TWENTY FORTY MAYBE A HUNDRED FULL TIME PEOPLE. SO I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET AT IS I DON'T SEE WHY ADDING WHERE PEOPLE THIS UNIT IS REALLY GOING TO BRING US MUCH VALUE AT WHEN WE KNOW THAT THERE IS LOTS OF ON GOING RESEARCH. EXTERNAL [inaudible] I'M. AND WE HAD A PARTICULAR. AREA OF RESEARCH THAT WE FELT WAS NECESSARY. THEN IT MIGHT BE MORE APPROPRIATE TO THE MISSION IT. BACK. VERSUS ADDING FOR PEOPLE WHEN I'M NOT EVEN SURE WHAT RESEARCH HAVE IN MIND FOR THEM DO. SO -- YEAH I'M NOT I'M A THE ADDITION OF OR F. E. I DON'T. MATERIAL I'VE READ SO FAR DOESN'T GIVE ME WE'RE JUST. EIGHT WELL I CAN CERTAINLY GO BACK AND TRY TO WANT TO BUY MORE OF WHAT SPECIFICALLY AYE DOING AN I TOTALLY RESPECT. I BELIEVE VERY STRONGLY IN THE WORK YOU RESPECT THAT I IF YOU. I'M AND ASKING. THE IT. YOU. BUT FOR US AS A COUNCIL WE CURRENTLY ONLY. AND SO BURKE UP. FOR US IT WOULD ALLOW AT REALLY. BE ABLE TO FOCUS SOME OF OUR WORK [inaudible] UP [inaudible] MORE. IS PLAY AND ALL ALSO BELIEVE PARTNER WITH SOME OF THOSE. ORGANIZATIONS WE TRY TO KEEP TRACK OF ALL OF THE EARTH WE ARE BACK TO BREAK. IT. REMOTE EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES WE SIMPLY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH. IF YOU THAT A WE EXPANDED I THINK TWO YEARS AGO AFFECTED ANYWAY. ONE IN. SUBSTANCE THIS ORDER. THIS WOULD GREATLY ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO HAVE STAFF LOOK AT ONE SUBSTANCE USE AND EFFECTIVE PRACTICES. SO WELL AN I PERSONALLY BELIEVE IT WOULD BUT A BIG DENT IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT RECOMMENDATIONS BEING ABLE TO DO A MUCH. I AM FOR US IT'S NOT AND I'M COUNTY -- IDENTIFYING BEST PRACTICES BEING ABLE. TO BRING THAT INFORMATION LIKE THIS THEY I AM ONLY -- WAY AND SO OF WELL I THINK THERE'S AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF WORK TO DO IN THE LONG TERM THIS WOULD GO UP. WITH A VERY PART OF US. PROVIDE BETTER UP MORE TIMELY RECOMMENDED [inaudible] FOUNDED [inaudible] MOST. CERTAINLY FIRE THE HEAD OF THE UNIT WITH WORST DAFT. NOT IN THE NOT AT ALL. YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THAT IT REALLY GIVES. LITTLE ABILITY YOU [inaudible] REAL RESEARCH. ARE. YOU HOW ADDING. FOR IF THAT MIGHT WARRANT SO. ESPECIALLY WHEN IT. I MEAN THE THE ITEMS. THE DESCRIPTION POOREST GIVE SOBRIETY OF THINGS THAT THE RESEARCH MIGHT. BE DONE BUT AGAIN. WHEN I THINK ABOUT SOME OF THE I SPOKE WITH THE? FOR MORE THAN. MY NEEDS ARE MORE THAN PEOPLE -- YOU KNOW OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF YOU KNOW I KNOW YOU'RE OUT. PERMANENT BUT OTHER WORDS ANY ONE ASPECT. WOULD BE MUCH LONGER TERM -- IT I WONDER WHETHER IT WE'RE NOT BETTER. UTILIZING. CONTRACTS WITH. RESPECT TO THIS WORK. AND USING OUR STAFF TO EVALUATE IT. AND YOU AND THEN MAKE REPORT WHICH MIGHT. AN EXAMPLE THAT MIGHT HELP THEM BUT THERE OF BY ALIVE. THE R. A. B.. PLAYING A ROLE. I'M PART OF WHAT I SEE THE VALUE IN THEY HAVE NOT BEEN -- IS. FOR SOMEBODY TO HELP. WORK WITH THEY ARE MEANT WE HAVE AN IT WE HAVE A LOT. IT WAS ENDING. WE HAVE A LOT OF THE I'M IN. EIGHT THESE. AND THIS PERSON CAN ACTUALLY MEET WITH SOME OF THE TALK ABOUT HOW TO MAKE THAT DATA AND BILLY AVAILABLE. TO ALL THE PEOPLE DOING DISTRICT EIGHT FOR THE UNIVERSITY I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF CITING. STASHING GOING ON ABOUT EIGHT A PORTAL. AT AT UNIVERSAL DATA SHARING AGREEMENT. HE SAID THAT. THAT WE ARE I'M LEARNING FROM EACH OTHER AND UNDERSTANDING HOW. AN INTERVENTION AT THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES ULTIMATELY AND LEAD. THIS IS STAFF PERSON IS SOMEONE THAT PERSONALLY. WE NEED IS THE LEAD ABLE. TO INTERACT WITH THOSE THAT ARE. IN ADDITION I'M SPECIFIC THE DATA WORK GROUP THAT WE STARTED WITH COUNTY [inaudible] I MERRILEES. AND HEALTH DEPARTMENT. THIS PERSON CAN DO SOME ADDITIONAL RESEARCH. ALSO RECOMMEND. I'LL TAKE YOU THERE. IT'S PHILLIP EIGHT THEM DOING. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BETTER AND AND WHICH OF THEIR PROGRAMS ARE ACTUALLY. AND SO TO ME THAT'S BY THE THAT'S WHY THAT PERSON IS NEEDED -- AT AND HE ADMINISTRATIVE WORK THAT. RATHER THAN GOING OUT AND COMMITTING RESEARCH I THINK OUR JOB. BILL SELECT DATE MORE RESEARCH BETTER [inaudible] SEVEN A PUBLIC COMMENT. THOUSAND SEIU LOCAL. ONE THOUSAND YOU KNOW WE SUPPORT THESE RESEARCH NEEDS THERE'S BEEN ALL THESE BILLS THIS YEAR. SIXTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT SIXTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN ASKING FOR RESEARCH WITHIN. THE DEPARTMENT WE THINK THESE ONE TIME STUDIES CONTRACT. ARE SNAPSHOTS AND IN TIME YOU DON'T GET TO THE ON GOING THE ONLY THING IS WE THINK. THAT THE FOCUS OF THE LEGISLATURE IS IN SOME WAY NOT LOOKING AT THE RIGHT THING. YOU KNOW BE A CC IS COMING UP NEXT. WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH ALL THE REALIGNMENT MONEY THAT'S GOING TO THE COUNTY AS WE LOOKED AT THE REPORTS THE BSS. YES HE HE HAS. THEY ASKED FOR SO LITTLE DATA TO THEIR MONEY ISN'T DONE HOW MANY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THEY GET ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND AMPLE. REACHED AT MILE THAT SENT DOWN UNDER THE YOUTH CRIMINAL JUSTICE WHAT HAPPENS TO ALL THAT MONEY IS IT A FACT THAT. ARE THEY SERVING THESE KIDS ARE THESE PROGRAMS WORKING DO THEY LEAD TO RECIDIVISM. WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE THIS RESEARCH UNIT LUCK. AT THOSE KINDS OF OF SITUATION BECAUSE WE KEEP WE JUST KEEP ON NOT REALLY FOCUSING ON WHETHER OR NOT THOSE ARE EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND SO WE'RE IN SUPPORT OF THANK. ARE YOU ONLY MENTIONED THE ONE TIME ONLY YOU ONLY MENTIONED THE CONTRACT ARE YOU SAYING YOU'RE IN SUPPORT OF BOTH CONTRACT AND OR IF HE BUT WHAT WE LIKE TO SEE IS THE ON GOING BECAUSE WE THINK OTHERWISE YOU JUST GET A SNAPSHOT IN. TIME IF THEY NEED A SYSTEM TO SET UP WILL COME UP WITH THE RUBRIC. WE THINK THAT THAT CERTAINLY THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL WHERE THEY COULD THEN POPULATE THOSE AREAS. BUT WE WOULD CERTAINLY WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE AREAS THAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT PARTICULARLY THESE LOCAL PROGRAMS WHERE THERE'S BEEN NO OVERSIGHT BY THE LEGISLATURE SINCE. TWENTY ELEVEN WHEN REALIGNMENT WENT THROUGH ITS SO CURSORY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THOSE BSE THE REPORT. WE NEED THIS UNIT TO COME UP WITH THE RUBRIC IT REALLY PUTS A FOCUS ON WHAT IT IS THAT WE NEED TO BE ASKING THOSE GLOBAL PROGRAM. SEE HOW WELL THAT MONEY IS BEING SPENT. AT ONE TIME CONTRACT WOULD HELP TO DO THAT YES WE WOULD BE THE ORDER. BUT WE THINK WE NEED ONGOING STAFF THAT WILL MONITOR THAT. NOT HAPPENING NOW THEY HAVE A PROGRAM WITH THE COUNTIES BUT WHAT HAPPENS PASSED PACKED. THEN WHAT HAPPENS WE DON'T KNOW IT'S NOT REALLY BEING REPORTED THE LEGEND. THANK. ANY OTHER PUBLIC COMMENT. AND I'M CHAIR HONORABLE MEMBER DANNY OFFER FROM LATIN ADVISORS REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE ON MENTAL ILLNESS [inaudible] RIGHT. IN ANY OTHER. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU [inaudible] YES OR WE OPERATE UNDER THE DIRECTION THAT THE AGENT. I THINK WE REALLY LOOK. I AM WORK IS REALLY SHINE A SPOTLIGHT IDENTIFY. I DON'T HAVE BY AYE STORY -- G. THAT IS WHAT [inaudible] OKAY. YOU INDICATED YOU REPORT LET STATE OR YOUR OR YOU'RE NOT UNDERSTANDING YOUR BILL I UNDERSTOOD YOU WERE EVER I I I AM ARE THE BUT THE REPORT LET PROVIDING. BUT YOU'RE BUT YOU'RE STILL WITHIN THE DIVISION OF SPEED THEY ARE AND SO YOU'RE THE HIERARCHY IS YOU WOULD REPORT TO SPEAK OUR I PROVIDE A I THINK THANK [inaudible] AGAIN AT THE PURPOSE OF THIS NOT BY. SIGHT [inaudible] HE THAT. IS PRESENT REALLY IDENTIFY FRAZIER POINT. WE SHOULD BE [inaudible] FOR EXAMPLE [inaudible] RECENT [inaudible] ALL [inaudible] WITHOUT. SYSTEMATICALLY LOOKING AT IT LIKE THAT BROUGHT. ONE WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IS THE THE LAST TWO YEARS [inaudible] NORMAN. ON HOW DO WE EFFECTIVELY. I AT AT CREATE [inaudible] RILED. I LOOK AT YOU BUT THAT WOULD BE. ONE WAY. RIGHT [inaudible] NUMBER. I THINK THE IDEA OF A FRAMEWORK. IN WORKING WITH I'M BACK REGIONALLY [inaudible] YEAH -- AT THIS IS WHERE YOU NEED. MAYBE WE NEED TO LOOK MORE AT RIGHT [inaudible] FOR MORE THE INTERIM. AND YOU KNOW WE'RE OBVIOUSLY BUT THAT'S RIGHT. WHETHER OR NOT. SO I THINK THAT. WITH ONE TIME. THE HELP [inaudible] EXPERT. ROUTE WHERE. WHERE WE LOOK FOR THAT INFORMATION WITH THE? AND THE ON GOING BACK. TO THE AT WORK. DOWN THAT. IT THAT. AND BY BACK [inaudible] I HAVE [inaudible] OUR I AM READ I WOULD MISS THE NAME IN THE RIGHT EXACTLY I'M NOT SURE WHY I'M NOT EITHER BUT I HAVE NO IDEA [inaudible] OUR YOUR ARE YOU [inaudible] OTHERWISE I WHAT OTHER ARE YOU. ALL IN THE OKAY MIGHT MY COUNCILMEMBERS AND FELL OFF AND BRING THE AYE. BUT CLEARLY MY RESPONSE. OUR REPORT. I'VE BEEN THERE. THE MOST RECENT REPORT ALLEN. SO WE ALSO HAVE BEEN WORKING IN THE DEPARTMENT TO IDENTIFY WAYS TO BUILD [inaudible] AND ARE. YEAH. SO THAT WE ARE TRANSFERRING -- PEOPLE IN A WAY THAT MORE SO. SO I'M SOME OF IT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. QUESTION IS OF MY BEING ABLE -- TO MY EXPERTISE IN COMING FROM. IN THE PARKING AND ANY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. AT WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT. ON THINGS I FEEL LIKE WITH THE STRENGTH IN THAT RELATIONSHIP -- AND THEN ALSO OUR COUNCIL MEMBERS THEMSELVES. WHO ARE VERY SOPHISTICATED -- WELL. WELL INFORMED ABOUT THESE ISSUES. AND THEY ADOPT THE WORK PLAN EVERY. YEAR AND PRIVATE [inaudible] WORK ON AS THE AYE IT ISSUE WITH A CRISIS. SO EACH YEAR WE DO FOCUS ON OTHER THINGS AND THIS YEAR WILL BE WILL BE FIFTEEN ON HELPING RECOMMENDATION ON OUR FROM CURRENT. OF UP OPPOSE THOSE AROUND IT HOMELESSNESS. AND BE MADE LONGER IN THE SENSE THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE FORMALLY. AT THE MALL [inaudible] WITH [inaudible] DIFFERENT. SOLDIERS BEING TOGETHER NAME MANY STUDIES. WE ARE THE NON FUNCTIONAL. ALSO WE HAVEN'T. LOOKED AT THAT WE I MERRILEES. SPECIFICALLY ON INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE SERIOUS. HONEST AND WORK ON IT. AND THAT'S KIND OF OUR THAT'S HOW WE NARROW DOWN ARE FOCUSED IN TERMS OF WHAT. BUT WE FEEL LIKE WE CAN OFFER BUT I WAS VERY EL EITHER THAT'S THE MONEY AND NEVER DONE IT BUDDY YOUNG OLD DOG -- YOU KNOW. NO NO NO SIR [inaudible] WHY NOT [inaudible] I'M. IT'S IT IT'S A GOOD QUESTION AM I I WAS UNAWARE OF BUT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING. THAT HAS BEEN BROUGHT. MUCH OF OUR ENGAGE STAPLES ACTUALLY DRIVE ARE A BENDA. PUTTING. I'M I'M MORE [inaudible] PROP. TWENTY A PROBLEM I HAVE. IS. IT ARE YOU IT. MIGHT BE MOVING USING THAT TERM A LOT. LATELY BUT OUR I I'M I'M I'M COMING FROM A MANAGEMENT STANDPOINT. I I HAVE TO RUN AN OPERATION AND I THAT. I'M NOT READING ANY -- YOUR THAT WOULD. AS ME I'M [inaudible] FINANCIAL BRIEF [inaudible] I'M [inaudible] TWO RIGHT. SO. ARE YOU JUST. APRIL HEALTH OR YOU. I DO WE BROUGH. THE SYSTEM IN OFFICE MAKE SURE THAT. WE WE AVOID PROBLEMS THAT ARE BEING RAISED. OUR STATUTE REPRESENTS A IDENTIFIES I WILL BE ABOUT AND DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE ARE YOU AT UNTIL -- MOST OF IT IS IS FOCUSED ON PROMOTING WHAT WE ALL BEST PRACTICES SO I THINK. ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I HAVE CHOSEN TO FOCUS ON GROWING THE AT THE AT THE COUNCIL WITH RESEARCH THAT IS AS OUR STATUTE SAYS THAT. WE SHOULD BASE OUR RECOMMENDATION FORM ALL THE STATE ON PAYDAY [inaudible] SO. THOSE ARE LIMITED -- TO OPPOSING GAINES. I I AND I THINK TOO I JUST TO BE FAIR -- THE COUNCIL'S BEEN FUNDED WITH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE AT FUNDING SO THE PLAN. YES OF THE BAND HAS BEEN THE SORT OF THE FOCUS HAS BEEN ON ON PROJECTS THAT RELATE THAT CAN BE USED WITH THAT SORT OF FUNDING. THIS FOR THIS PROPOSAL ITSELF IS ASKING GENERAL FUND WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE COUNCIL TO GET INTO. AREAS THAT THEY HADN'T PREVIOUSLY GOTTEN AND AND WHY DON'T WE JUST ASK FOR MORE MONEY BOTTOM LINE [inaudible] TO AN WE SPECIFICALLY WANTED OF STATE GENERAL FUND BECAUSE WE WANTED TO DO MORE WORK LOOKING AT THE USE OF ROWLEY'S RPN TRAIN AND YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S A PRIORITY. LEGISLATURE. REST AND MOVE THAT SYSTEM AS A PRIORITY. ARE MEANT TO MOVE REHABILITATING THREE AND THREE SO I THINK WE FELT A LITTLE BIT LIMITED BECAUSE WE WERE ONLY FUNDED WITH MENTAL HEALTH. THAT FELLERS. WE HAVE A THERE'S THE WHOLE REALM OF THE WORK THAT WE DO WITH EDGES. ATTORNEYS AND PUBLIC DEFENDERS TO HAVE COME TO US SAYING THAT THEY ARE. INTERESTED IN PARTNERING MORE AND SO THIS GIVES US A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY FOR US TO IDENTIFY PROJECT. THAT. ARE NOT SPECIFIC TO PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION. AND ONLY. A RIGHT I THINK THEY WERE VERY FOR QUESTIONS IN. YOU'VE BEEN PUT IN THE HOT SEAT WE'RE NEITHER. UNDER MORE LAUGHTER I WORK. IN THE LEGISLATURE WHEN YOU'RE COUNSEL WAS DOUBTLESS. AND WELL I'M SOMEWHAT FAMILIAR WITH THE STATUTE I THINK I'M. BE CLEAR THE THE LEGISLATURE WHEN AN ESTABLISHING IT FELT TOO GREAT NEED AN I'M NOT DESCRIBING THAT THERE ISN'T A NEED. FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT THE COUNSELOR THAT -- MORE CLEARLY BETTER PROVING BEST PRACTICE. I THINK THE THE ISSUE MAY BE THAT IS THE SCOPE. OF WORK. IN A WAY WHEN CONSIDERED AN UNLIMITED SCOPE OF WORK AND DOES. FOR ME ANYWAY DOES. YOU ADDITIONAL F. B. E. REALLY ACCOMPLISH IT OR NOT OR WHETHER WE SHOULD BE APPROACHING THIS. WAY AND PERHAPS IT'S SOMETHING WHERE WE INLAND. THE REAL LOOK AT AS ACTED IN THE REACHED NUMBER IN WHETHER. IT FITS YOUR NEEDS NOW. AND THEN A N. WHETHER THE TYPE OF FUNCTION. THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD HOUSE. I MEAN OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE LOOKING AT YOU'RE DOING RESEARCH IN REVIEWING. AREAS OF PRACTICE WITHIN CTR CLEARLY BUT SHOULD IT BE HOUSE DIRECTLY. UNDER IN REPORTING. OUR I THINK THAT MAY BE ANOTHER LEGITIMATE QUESTION. A SIMILAR. TO NOT THAT REFERENCE BUT THERE WAS A REFERENCE BY MR WIDELY AS WHETHER. RULE BOARD SHOULD BE HIRING THE LAWYERS. THAT ARE GONNA THEN BE. I MEAN BEFORE THE PAROLE BOARD RIGHT THERE WAS THAT SO THERE'S ALWAYS THAT -- WHAT'S WHAT IS OUR PURPOSE FOR AN END TO BE AND WHAT SITS ATOP THE MALL REPORTING STRUCTURE. TO ACHIEVE THAT WHICH YOU KNOW WE MAY YEAH -- I THINK. FOR US WELL THIS WASN'T. IF YOU'RE GOING TO IS TODAY WAS JUST OF BY THE BEASTIE BE BEFORE US. I THINK FOR THOSE BLESSED WERE. I'M NOT NUDE YET I HAVEN'T SEEN REPORTS EITHER JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND BETTER. THE ROLE AND FUNCTION OF THE COUNCIL AND WHAT AND HOW IT FITS IN. WE LOOK AT YOUR CREATION IN TWO THOUSAND ONE WE'RE VERY DIFFERENT CDC ARE NOW WE'RE A VERY DIFFERENT. THERE'S BEEN MUCH. ANYWAY SO I THINK IT'S WORTH THE REST. I'VE GOT START ON MY LIST FIVE TIMES GETTING YOU THOSE REPORT SO WE'RE GOING [inaudible] CERTAINLY. THANK YOU AND AGAIN I'M I HOPE THAT YOU APPRECIATE THAT WE WERE NOT TRYING TO IN THE AS AND ASK OF OUR QUESTIONS. ONE IN A WAY IT WAS MORE IN EDUCATION FOR US RATHER THAN SO MUCH HEAT NOT FOR ANY DIRECT CRITICISM OF WHAT YOU'RE PARTMINER COUNCIL IT'S BEEN DOING SINCE WERE LESS FAMILIAR IT'S REALLY MUCH MORE. RIGHT NOW AND AND I UNDERSTAND. ALL RIGHT. ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM I GUESS WE HEARD IT YEAH WE DID HERE QUALITY. BUT YOU WERE NO NO NO SENATOR MORE LIKE IT'S COMPLETELY LEGITIMATE NIGHT YOUR QUESTIONS WERE VERY -- ROLE. ALL RIGHT WE'LL NOW GO -- TO THE BORDER STATE COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS. AND WHAT IS BEFORE US IS A FUNDING FOR STANDARDS AND TRAINING FOR LOCAL FOR CORRECTIONS. MY COURSE IS ANOTHER ONE SENATOR MORE LIKE AND I ARE GOING TO BE LIKE OKAY. THIS IS I MEAN MOSTLY BECAUSE WHILE. REALIGNMENT WAS CLEARLY ENHANCED AT LEAST WHEN I WAS IN THE LEGISLATURE IT WASN'T STARTED IT WAS START IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS STARTED PRIOR. AND EVEN YES HE SEES EXISTENCE HAS BEEN SINCE I'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE BUT THIS WHOLE. ROLLER YES CC. AND COUNTIES IN REALIGNMENT HAS BEEN -- NOT JUST GROWING OR MAYBE NOT GROWING IS IT. IN THE TRANSITION THAT THE STATE WAS UNDERTAKING BACK IN TWENTY ELEVEN THERE WAS. CLEAR NEED TO ALL RIGHT WE'RE MAKING A BIG TRANSITION WE BETTER HAVE SOMEBODY BE MONITORING -- BUT I THINK SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE HEARD SO FAR. I'M MOSTLY IN PUBLIC COMMENT BUT IS FULL ISSUE OF YOU KNOW WHAT. WHAT'S BEEN OUR OVERSIGHT OR EVEN YOUR OVERSIGHT EVERYONE. AND I WILL BE VERY UP FRONT RIGHT NOW IN THIS IS NOT EXACTLY. A STEP YES THIS ONE ISSUE AREA BUT I HAVE A VERY HARD TIME GETTING ACCURATE DATA. ONE YES. WHAT IT YOU KNOW HOW? WHAT IS THE MONEY THAT STATE IS PROVIDING THE COUNTIES UNDER REALIGNMENT AND FOR WHAT PURPOSE AND WHAT'S THE RELATION EITHER BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE HELD? I'M THEIR HEALTH. AND WHAT'S YOUR SITE AND WHAT WE ARE SEEING NOW IS AN INCREASE IN YEAH. OF INMATES IN COUNTY JAILS BURSTING IN A A INCREASE IN. I'M OLD VARIETY OF ISSUE NOW PART OF THAT IS WE'VE BUT A LOT MORE PEOPLE THERE. IT'S NOT REALLY THE ONLY REASON BUT IT IS A FACTOR -- AND YOU KNOW WHETHER THE STATE IS DOING ACT [inaudible] ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT. CLEAR TO ME [inaudible] ON BUT AGAIN YOUR YOUR DAY. OUT THE BCP FOR STANDARDS IN TRAINING BUT WE MAY WANT AT SOME POINT HAVE. BROADER. OVERSIGHT OVER STATE OUT -- YES OF COURSE [inaudible] EVAN. I KNOW I KNOW WE CAN FEEL LIKE WE'VE BEEN GIVEN A MAC A LOT OF MONEY AND THEY FEEL LIKE NO YOU DID IT. YEAH. ALL RIGHT BUT THIS IS ON THE STRAND THEATRE'S IN TRAINING GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M KATIE HOW ARE THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE B. SEC SO JUMPING NARROWLY TO THIS B. C. P. TODAY WHICH DOES -- PROVIDE FUNDING FOR STANDARDS AND TRAINING FOR CAN OR CORRECTIONS STC. I HAVE OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR YVONNE GARNER WHO IS OUR EXPERT ON THIS TOPIC AND I'LL ASK YOU TO PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE WITH AN OVERVIEW. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON I'M THIS REQUEST IS FOR AN INCREASE OF SIX POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN ONGOING LOCAL ASSISTANCE FUNDING FOR TRAINING. INCLUDING CRITICAL AREAS LIKE BEHAVIOR HALL CRISIS INTERVENTION AND DE ESCALATION COMMON FORM THERE. GENDER IDENTIFICATION AND SEXUAL ASSAULT AND ABUSE. THE TRAINING IS DESIGNED FOR CORRECTIONS STAFF EMPLOYED IMPROVE. APARTMENTS AND JAILS OPERATED BY SHERIFF'S OFFICES AND POLICE DEPARTMENTS. THE FUNDING REALLY SUPPORTS THE INCREASE TRAINING DEMANDS RESULTING FROM MORE COMPLEX SUPERVISION MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. THAT REQUIRE OFFICERS TO HAVE MORE AND BETTER. TRAINING TO SUCCESSFULLY PERFORM THEIR JOB. THE FINDING I THINK SHOULD BE NOTED THAT IT DOES NOT FULLY COVERED THE COSTS OF LOCAL CORRECTIONS TRAINING BUT IT'S REALLY INTENDED TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO CORRECTIONS AGENCIES IN MEETING. THE STATE TRAINING REQUIREMENTS AND TO SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S THE LARGER [inaudible] STRATEGY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS REQUEST TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. I KNOW LA O.. S. M.. I MEANT. YES MEN OF THE REQUEST GO AHEAD. THANK YOU. AT FIRST I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT RATES OF COMPLIANCE WITH. TRAINING REQUIREMENTS ARE CURRENTLY VERY HIGH IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN ONLY FORTY SEVEN OUT OF ROUGHLY THIRTY THREE THOUSAND ELIGIBLE. OFFICERS AT COMPLETED THE REQUIRED TRAINING. I'M. SORRY EXCUSE ME FAILED TO COMPLETE EXCUSE ME. FAILED TO COMPLETE -- STARTING TO LOSE. BUDGET. I HAVE FAILED TO COMPLETE THE REQUIRED TRAINING -- SO IT APPEARS THAT HE PROPOSED FUNDING WOULD HAVE. LIKELY RELATIVELY LITTLE IMPACT ON THE OVERALL AMOUNT OF TRAINING THAT IS RECEIVED. I'M IN OTHER WORDS WORDS WOULD -- ESSENTIALLY BE PROVIDING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO LOCALS OR DOING WHAT THEY IS ACTUALLY ARE ALREADY DOING AND WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO BE DOING. I'M THE BOARD ALSO DOESN'T COLLECT DATA ON ON I'M WHAT TYPES OF TRAINING -- OFFICERS ARE PARTICIPATING IN AS A RISK AS A PART OF THIS PROGRAM -- SO IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER OR NOT THE EXISTING TRAINING BEING PROVIDED AT WITH EXISTING RESOURCES IS CONSISTENT WITH THE LEGISLATURE'S PRIORITIES. SO WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THE PROPOSAL BECAUSE THAT -- DOESN'T APPEAR THAT IT WOULD MEANING CLEAR FACT RAINING. I'M AN INSIDE DIRECTING THE SEC TO START COLLECTING DATA ON THE TYPES OF TRAINING RECEIVED SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE. AN ASSASSIN THE FUTURE WHETHER. THAT TRAINING IS CONSISTENT WITH ITS GOALS AND THEN POTENTIALLY BE IN A POSITION TO ALTER. AND THE PROGRAM SHOULD IT BE AN CHANGES BEING NECESSARY. HOWEVER TO THE EXTENT THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO ENSURE THAT OFFICERS RECEIVE. AT CERTAIN TYPES OF TRAINING OR MORE TO MORE TRAINING IN. TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHT COULD CREATE A SEPARATE PROGRAM AND THAT'S MORE TARGETED ONE TIME GRANT PROGRAM TO ACHIEVE. GOALS. IF I UNDERSTAND THAT CORRECTLY IN EFFECT LA -- SAYING. NO I'M BEING GLIB NOW BUT YOU ARE. THE A YOU'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL. AND YOUR PROVIDED THE TRAINING THAT IT WOULD APPEAR WE'VE REQUIRED WHY DO YOU NEED ANOTHER SIX POINT TWO MILLION TO DO WHAT YOU'RE ALREADY DOING -- AND SO THAT [inaudible] MY NATURAL. WANT TO COMMENT. THE COUNTY IS A REALLY STRUGGLING I THINK RIGHT NOW WITH ALL OF BEING COMMAND SO I THINK WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IT'S PAST PERFORMANCE AND IT'S BEEN GREAT AND LOCAL AGENCIES ARE WORKING VERY VERY HARD TO ENSURE ALL THEIR STAFF ARE TRAINED. BUT THOSE DEMANDS STRESSED KEEP COMING IN THERE ARE BIGGER AND THE I AM. FOCUS RIGHT NOW ON PROVIDING OF REALLY GOOD BEHAVIOR HEALTH TRAINING IN THIS REALLY BROAD UMBRELLA IS GREAT AND THAT'S LONG AND EXPENSIVE TRAINING. SO THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE FACED WITH NOW IN THAT CONTINUING TO CHALLENGE THEM AND AT THE REQUEST FOR THIS FUNDING IS TO HELP. OFFSET SOME OF THOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS FOR SOME OF THAT MORE AT AN EXPENSIVE AND LENGTHY -- TRAINING THAT REALLY IS CRITICAL TO AND THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL JOB PERFORMANCE AND THE SAFETY OF THE FACILITIES THAT THEY WORK AND THE ISSUE IS WHY YOU GAVE US THAT VERBAL WHEN I READ THE B. C. P. THERE'S NO. IT DOESN'T DISTINGUISH WHAT LIKE THAT THERE'S THIS NEED. IN A THERE'S YOU KNOW THIS GAP IN THE TRAINING WE PROVIDE. AND THUS WE NEED THIS FUNDING. TO PROVIDE THIS ADDITIONAL TRAINING THAT IS. REALLY NOT IN THERE. YEAH THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT CARDS OF TRAINING AND ONE IS THE TRAINING THAT ONE RECEIVES WHEN THEY ARE FIRST EMPLOYED IN A JOB AND THAT SORT OF RIGHT TO ME SOUTH TRAINING IN THESE ARE THE VERY LENGTHY. TRAININGS AND WE ARE ACTUALLY BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO TO REQUEST SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO DO A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF THESE JOBS TO DETERMINE HOW THEIR JOBS HAVE CHANGED OVER TIME. AND WHAT SORT OF NEW ADDITIONAL TRAINING THEY MIGHT NEED TO SUCCESSFULLY PERFORM THOSE JOBS. AS A RESULT OF THAT WE HAVE RECENTLY -- REVISED THOSE ACADEMY CELL TRAINING SO INCLUDE A LOT OF NEW TRAINING AND IT INCLUDES A TWENTY FOUR HOUR AND MODULE IN BEHAVIOR HEALTH AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL TRAINING. AND INSERT GENDER IDENTIFICATION SEXUAL ASSAULT AND ABUSE I'M SO LOTS OF NEW TRAINEES BEEN FOLDED INTO THOSE ACADEMY TRAININGS SO THAT WAS APPROVED IN JANUARY AND WE ARE IN A A I'M [inaudible] SORT OF IT'S A PHASE RIGHT NOW TRANSITION WHERE WILL BECOME AND THE FULLY THE NEW REQUIREMENT I'M A JULY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY SO FOLKS ARE GETTING READY TO DO THAT. ON THE ANNUAL SIDE THAT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. AND WE DO OUR FULLY PRESCRIPTIVE IN THE I'M A CATALYST ON MEETING WE DEFINE ALL OF THE CONTENT THAT NEEDS TO BE REQUIRED THE NUMBER OF HOURS YOU KNOW THAT THE TESTING. ALL OF THAT ON AT THE ANNUAL SIDE WE SIMPLY REQUIRING THIS IS WHERE THE LA WAS TALKING ABOUT THE CONTENT ISN'T TRACKED WHAT WE DO REQUIRES A NUMBER OF HOURS TO BE COMPLETED FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TRAINING. WE DO NOT PRESCRIBE THE CONTENT OF THOSE HOURS AND THAT IS BECAUSE THE NEEDS OF THAT TRAINING VERY IS IT VARIES BY. BY COUNTY IT VARIES BY THE INDIVIDUAL WHO'S GOING TO BE TRAINED SO WE'VE REALLY LEAVE THAT TO THE DISCRETION OF THE EMPLOYING AGENCIES. AND THAT IS THE PIECE THAT IS IN THIS PERSPECTIVE AND THAT IS THE PIECE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT TIME. TO PROVIDE A LOT MORE OF THIS I'M AB ON BEHAVIOR HEALTH TRAINING THAT THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY COURTS GOING TO PROVIDE A FOUNDATION. MAYBE YOU ALL JUST NEED -- YEAH NOT TRYING TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF OUR DELIBERATIONS BUT IF YOU READ THIS BCP. I'M SORRY BUT IT SAYS. B. I'M THERE IS A TRAINING THE THERE WAS FOUNDED TRAINING GAP ANALYSIS OR BETTER BEHAVIORAL. HEALTH TRAINING BUT THEN IT SAYS THE CORE TRAINING NOW INCLUDES IN IT LISTS MANY ASPECTS OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH THAT ARE IN THE CORE TRAINING. AND IT DOESN'T INDICATE WHICH ASPECT OF THIS BEHAVIOR ALL THE WOULD NEED TO BE ENHANCED IT SAYS A GREAT AMOUNT OF IT SUBSTANCE ABUSE INTERVENTIONS RESOURCES SUICIDE PREVENTION IT'S ARTS CENTER. AND THEN WE HAVE THE DATA THAT SHOWS ONLY FORTY SEVEN OF THE PEOPLE DIDN'T GET IT YET. SO. A AND THEN THE VERY BOTTOM MRS THIS PER PROPOSAL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING SO THEY LOCAL AGENCIES CAN MEET THE STATE TRAINING STANDARDS FOR THE CORRECTION WHICH IS THE CORE TRAINING. MAJORITY MEETING THEM SO ANYWAY THAT'S I THINK JUST ONE CLEAR FINE POINT IS THAT WE DID DO THIS COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE ENTIRE TRAINING STANDARDS AND OUR BOARD JUST IN JANUARY. APPROVED UPDATED NEW AN IMPROVED AND SIGNIFICANTLY MODIFIED TRAINING STANDARDS SELVES THAT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE OF WHY THIS RIGHT NOW. IS IS IN -- VIEW OF THE RECENT INCREASE IN AND APPROVAL BY THE BOARD OF OUR TRAINING STANDARDS. THAT NON COMPLIANCE WAS FOR THE PRIOR BEFORE WE IMPLEMENTED THESE NEW STANDARDS INCLUDING THAT EXPANDED BEHAVIOR HEALTH TRAINING. YOU WEREN'T INTENDING TO ACT ON IT TODAY BUT NOW WE COULDN'T ANYWAY GET RIGHT. BUT AT LEAST YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT MY QUESTIONS ARE RELATED TO IT AND YOU'VE HEARD FROM LA -- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WE TO MY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I JUST WANNA ADD THAT. NOT ONLY OTHER ADDITIONAL STANDARDS THE TRAINING BUT THERE AS PART OF THIS PROPOSAL IS -- TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE RECENT CUTS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE TO THE AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR THIS PROGRAM INCLUDING WITH THE LOCALS CAN. USE TOWARDS TRAINING SO THE TAPE INTO CONSIDERATION AS WELL -- WELL THE YOU MIGHT NEED TO REVISE THIS BC PEAKS IS NOT OBVIOUS IN IT. AT ALL. ISN'T IT AMAZING I ACTUALLY READ THEM -- ALRIGHT SO. LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE SIDE OF ON ROTTEN SEIU. ONE THOUSAND WE THINK THAT WHAT THE LA I WAS SAYING AND ALL THESE PROGRAMS. THIS REALLY MAKES SENSE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ASSUME SOME OVERSIGHT ON THIS BEFORE WE JUST KEEP GIVING MONEY. TO THESE PROGRAMS AND SO WE WOULD. AND WE WOULD BACK WHAT AT LEAST ON THIS IN ON THE MANY OTHERS TO LOOK AT THAT AS WELL THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS DANIEL SANCHEZ ON BEHALF OF THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA -- IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL I'M I JUST WANT TO REITERATE WHAT I I KNOW THE COMMITTEE IS FAMILIAR WITH AND THAT -- PROBATION RECEIVES -- THE VAST MAJORITY OF CLOSE TO NOT ALL OF OUR TRAINING THROUGH STC SO IT'S REALLY FUNDAMENTAL -- AND AND PROBATION AND SEE POP HOLD TRAINING IN IN THE HIGHEST REGARD -- AS I THINK WAS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS IS -- THIS FUNDING HAS DECLINED -- FOR OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS BY SEVERAL.

T. C. PROGRAM. I REALLY POINTS TO ISSUES WITH -- THE DATA COLLECTION I IN THE BSE SEE MORE BROADLY AND ISSUES WITH ENSURING THE EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF TRAINING. I WOULD ADD THAT THE PS YOU SEE IN EXAMINING THE TRAINING EFFECTIVENESS I NOT ONLY LOOK AT THE AMOUNT AND THE TYPE OF TRAINING BUT ALSO HOW IT'S IMPLEMENTED SO IN PARTICULAR.

WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF LOOKING CLOSELY AT HOW THE BCC IS CONDUCTING ITS STANDARDS AND TRAINING DUTIES. AND ANALYZING AND PERHAPS EVEN REQUIRING ADDITIONAL MEASURES NEEDED TO ENSURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ANY BUDGET ALLOCATIONS AND PROPOSALS LIKE TODAY. THERE BEEN RECENT POWERFUL EVIDENCE OF THE INFECTED AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE TRAINING CURRENTLY PROVIDED BY THE B. ASSISI. WAS A RECENT LOS ANGELES OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL INVESTIGATION INTO THE USE OF FORCE SPECIFICALLY THE USE OF CHEMICAL AGENTS. IN JUVENILE FACILITIES IN LA COUNTY AND THIS INVESTIGATION WORK AND COVERED SOME EXTREMELY DISTURBING PRACTICES INCLUDING USING CHEMICAL SPRAY IT'S AN INITIAL INTERMEDIATE RESPONSE TO NON COMPLIANCE INCLUDING NON THREATENING NON COMPLIANCE. I'M A LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OF APPROPRIATE DECONTAMINATION PROCEDURES AND THESE THINGS ARE HIGHLIGHTED IN ONE SPECIFIC INCIDENT WHERE YOUTH WHO AS. ENGAGING IN SELF HARMING BEHAVIOUR WAS ACTUALLY CHEMICALLY SPRAYED IN THE GROIN AND BUTTOCKS AND LEFT IN A ROOM WITH NO RUNNING WATER FOR TWENTY MINUTES. THE STAFF THEMSELVES IN THESE FACILITIES IDENTIFIED INADEQUATE TRAINING AS THE REASON FOR THE OVER RELIANCE ON CHEMICAL SPRAY. THEY SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED THAT THE COURSES ARE INSUFFICIENT AND UNREALISTIC. HE SAID THAT IMPROVEMENTS ARE NEEDED IN THE CONTENT OF THE TRAINING AND ALSO THE METHODS FOR DELIVERY OF THE TRAINING. AND I SAY ALL THIS TO APPRECIATE THIS COMMITTEE AND THE LA YO'S. AN EFFORT TO LOOK CLOSELY AT WHAT WOULD ACTUALLY EFFECTIVELY IMPROVE TRAINING. TIME AND FOR ANY FURTHER ANALYSIS AT THIS COMMITTEE OR THE LA -- OR ANYONE ELSE CAM DOCKS I WOULD ENCOURAGED ANALYSIS TO ALSO INCLUDE EXAMINATIONS OF OTHER DIVISIONS WITHIN THE BE A CC FOR EXAMPLE THE BILL STILL THE STANDARDS AND TRAINING.
