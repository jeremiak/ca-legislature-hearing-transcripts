RESIDENT CALIFORNIA.

00:41:53.811 --> 00:41:54.445
I HAD THE HONOR OF CENTER

00:41:54.511 --> 00:41:56.080
SERVING THE WORLD'S GREATEST AIR

00:41:56.146 --> 00:41:58.782
AND SPACE POWER. FOR A PERIOD OF

00:41:58.849 --> 00:42:00.184
ELEVEN YEARS AND NINE MONTHS.

00:42:00.251 --> 00:42:02.086
I SERVED IN OPERATION IRAQI

00:42:02.152 --> 00:42:04.722
FREEDOM OPERATION DOING FREEDOM

00:42:04.788 --> 00:42:06.290
AND TWO CONSECUTIVE TOURS AND

00:42:06.357 --> 00:42:08.192
REPUBLIC OF KOREA.

00:42:08.259 --> 00:42:10.427
BY SO MANY OF MY OF MY BROTHERS

00:42:10.494 --> 00:42:11.562
AND SISTERS IN ARMS.

00:42:11.629 --> 00:42:13.464
BECAME A CRESSMAN A CRESSMAN A

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:15.466
PERFORMING MY DUTIES IN THE

00:42:15.532 --> 00:42:16.100
ATMOSPHERE OF CLEAR AND PRESENT

00:42:16.166 --> 00:42:17.334
DANGER.

00:42:17.401 --> 00:42:18.335
LIKE SO MANY OF OUR BROTHERS AND

00:42:18.402 --> 00:42:20.137
SISTERS IN ARMS THE SUM OF ALL

00:42:20.204 --> 00:42:22.106
THOSE FEARS WERE FORMING A CLAMP

00:42:22.172 --> 00:42:24.208
PRESIDENT JR PALE IN COMPARISON

00:42:24.275 --> 00:42:26.210
TO THE FAIR REJOINING OUR

00:42:26.277 --> 00:42:27.511
BELOVED COUNTRY AS A CIVILIAN.

00:42:27.578 --> 00:42:29.413
BECOMING A CIVILIAN AGAIN AS

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:30.047
HARD BECAUSE OF THE THINGS WE

00:42:30.114 --> 00:42:31.982
MAY HAVE HAVE WE MAY HAVE GONE

00:42:32.049 --> 00:42:33.150
THROUGH OUT WE SERVED.

00:42:33.217 --> 00:42:34.485
THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT COIN IS

00:42:34.551 --> 00:42:35.920
THAT OUR WARTIME IN PEACE TIME

00:42:35.986 --> 00:42:39.223
DUTIES ARE NONTRANSFERABLE TO

00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:40.057
THE CIVILIAN SECTOR.

00:42:40.124 --> 00:42:40.958
THIS MEANS THAT IN ORDER TO

00:42:41.025 --> 00:42:43.794
SURVIVE AFTER SERVING WE HAVE TO

00:42:43.861 --> 00:42:45.896
GO BACK TO COLLEGE.

00:42:45.963 --> 00:42:47.564
THE MAJORITY OF HAT THE MAJORITY

00:42:47.631 --> 00:42:49.533
OF US HAVE THE GI BILL WHICH IS

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:51.001
SUFFICIENT FORCE TO COMPLETE OUR

00:42:51.068 --> 00:42:52.169
BATCHES AGREE.

00:42:52.236 --> 00:42:54.204
BUT IN MANY CASES THAT DOES NOT

00:42:54.271 --> 00:42:55.272
MAKE US COMPATIBLE CUT

00:42:55.339 --> 00:42:56.840
COMPETITIVE ENOUGH TO SCORE THE

00:42:56.907 --> 00:42:59.410
GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT WE NEED TO

00:42:59.476 --> 00:43:00.778
SUSTAIN FOR OUR FAMILIES.

00:43:00.844 --> 00:43:01.845
THIS DIRECTLY MEANS THAT IN

00:43:01.912 --> 00:43:03.547
ORDER FOR SOME VETERANS TO BE

00:43:03.614 --> 00:43:04.581
TRULY COMPETITIVE ENOUGH

00:43:04.648 --> 00:43:07.918
WORKFORCE WE MUST ACHIEVE HIGHER

00:43:07.985 --> 00:43:09.320
THAN A BACHELOR'S DEGREE.

00:43:09.386 --> 00:43:10.721
WHEN IT COMES TO ACHIEVING

00:43:10.788 --> 00:43:11.889
HIGHER THAN A BASS IS AGREED

00:43:11.956 --> 00:43:14.024
NORMALLY A VETERAN HAS EXHAUSTED

00:43:14.091 --> 00:43:15.559
OR NEARLY EXHAUSTED ALL OF THEIR

00:43:15.626 --> 00:43:17.127
GI BILL?

00:43:17.194 --> 00:43:17.962
THIS IS WHERE THE VOCATIONAL

00:43:18.028 --> 00:43:19.630
REHAB BUT REHABILITATION COMES

00:43:19.697 --> 00:43:21.565
INTO PLAY AND IT CAN PROVIDE THE

00:43:21.632 --> 00:43:23.334
LAST BLUES A VETERAN NEEDS TO

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:24.702
ACHIEVE THAT COMPETITIVE EDGE

00:43:24.768 --> 00:43:26.236
FOR GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT.

00:43:26.303 --> 00:43:27.304
ALTHOUGH A LARGE NUMBER OF

00:43:27.371 --> 00:43:28.706
VETERANS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR

00:43:28.772 --> 00:43:30.107
VOCATIONAL REHAB NOT ALL

00:43:30.174 --> 00:43:31.875
VETERANS CAN AND RECEIVE THE

00:43:31.942 --> 00:43:34.311
ENTITLEMENT OF OCCASIONAL REHAB.

00:43:34.378 --> 00:43:35.279
AND THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE

00:43:35.346 --> 00:43:36.180
TODAY.

00:43:36.246 --> 00:43:38.082
WE ARE HERE BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S

00:43:38.148 --> 00:43:41.685
VETERANS IS OVER YES AT THE DAY

00:43:41.752 --> 00:43:42.519
HAVE BEEN TOLD NO.

00:43:42.586 --> 00:43:44.088
WE ARE HERE FOR CALIFORNIA

00:43:44.154 --> 00:43:46.023
VETERANS WHO NEED TO COMPLETE OR

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:47.791
ACHIEVE THEIR HIGHER DEGREE BUT

00:43:47.858 --> 00:43:49.827
CAN'T RECEIVE THE BACKING THEY

00:43:49.893 --> 00:43:51.695
NEED FROM VOCATIONAL REHAB.

00:43:51.762 --> 00:43:53.097
LET US BE REALISTIC.

00:43:53.163 --> 00:43:55.099
SB FIVE HUNDRED IS THE FINAL

00:43:55.165 --> 00:43:56.166
SAVING GRACE.

00:43:56.233 --> 00:43:57.968
THAT ONLY A FEW VETERANS WILL

00:43:58.035 --> 00:43:59.703
NEED ALTHOUGH OF ACTUAL ALTHOUGH

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:02.072
BACHELOR DEGREES ARE THE NORM

00:44:02.139 --> 00:44:03.574
NOT EVERY VETERAN WILL NEED

00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:05.242
HIGHER THAN A BACHELOR'SDEGREE.

00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:06.510
AND MOST VETERANS NEED HIGHER

00:44:06.577 --> 00:44:08.779
THAN A BASS IT'S AGREE WILL BE

00:44:08.846 --> 00:44:10.447
HELPED BY VOCATIONAL REHAB.

00:44:10.514 --> 00:44:12.716
SB FIVE HUNDRED IS THE YES WHEN

00:44:12.783 --> 00:44:15.786
THE LAST OF US HAVE BEEN TOLD NO.

00:44:15.853 --> 00:44:17.187
THIS JUST MEANS THAT EVEN THOUGH

00:44:17.254 --> 00:44:18.422
WE CAN NO LONGER BE HEROES FOR

00:44:18.489 --> 00:44:20.324
OUR COUNTRY WE CAN BE HEROES FAR

00:44:20.391 --> 00:44:22.126
FAMILIES.

00:44:22.192 --> 00:44:23.894
WHEN THE AVERAGE BETTER RETURNS

00:44:23.961 --> 00:44:26.030
TO THE CIVILIAN SECTOR HERE SHE

00:44:26.096 --> 00:44:27.364
RETURNS WITH THE FAMILY?

00:44:27.431 --> 00:44:28.599
A MONTHS THE STRAIN OF

00:44:28.665 --> 00:44:31.335
DISABILITY WHO SCARS ARE SEEN

00:44:31.402 --> 00:44:33.470
AND UNSEEN.

00:44:33.537 --> 00:44:34.772
THE NEED TO PROVIDE FOR ONE'S

00:44:34.838 --> 00:44:36.206
FAMILY IN SPITE OF INJURY AND

00:44:36.273 --> 00:44:37.474
THE DISADVANTAGE OF TIME IS

00:44:37.541 --> 00:44:38.409
PARAMOUNT.

00:44:38.475 --> 00:44:40.477
AGAIN SB FIVE HUNDRED IS THAT

00:44:40.544 --> 00:44:41.478

VETERAN BECOMES WHAT HE OR SHE

00:44:45.015 --> 00:44:46.617
NEEDS TO BE FOR THEIR FAMILY.

00:44:46.683 --> 00:44:48.152
SB FIVE HUNDRED IS A YES TO THE
