FILE ITEM TWENTY THREE HR TWENTY NINE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER ARAMBULA CORKERY HOUSE RESOLUTION TWENTY NINE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER ARAMBULA RELATIVE TO SAYS A SHOP IS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARAMBULA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. SAYS SERVICE PRODUCT CHAVEZ WAS BORN IN YUMA ARIZONA ON MARCH THIRTY FIRST NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN. IN THE LATE NINETEEN THIRTIES AFTER LOOK THEY'RE LOSING THEIR HOUSE IN A FOR CLOSURE HE AND HIS FAMILY JOINED MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO MOVED TO CALIFORNIA DURING THE GREAT DEPRESSION AND BECAME MIGRANT FARM WORKERS. WITH ONLY AN EIGHTH GRADE EDUCATION CHAVEZ DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL AND BEGAN WORKING IN THE FIELDS FULL TIME. IN NINETEEN FORTY SIX HE JOINED THE U. S. NAVY SERVING OUR COUNTRY'S FOR TWO YEARS IN A SEGREGATED UNIT. IN NINETEEN FIFTY TWO CHAVEZ WAS WORKING AT A LUMBER YARD IN SAN JOSE WHEN HE BECAME A GRASSROOTS ORGANIZER. OVER THE% NEXT DECADE HE WOULD REGISTER NEW VOTERS AND FIGHT RACIAL AND ECONOMIC DISCRIMINATION. THAT SAME YEAR HE USED HIS LIFE SAVINGS TO FUND THE NATIONAL FARM WORKERS ASSOCIATION IN DELANO CALIFORNIA. WORKING DOGGEDLY TO BUILD THE N. W. F. EIGHT ALONGSIDE FELLOW ORGANIZER TO LOTUS WHAT THE CHAVEZ TRAVELED AROUND THE SAN JOAQUIN AND IMPERIAL VALLEY'S TO RECRUIT UNION MEMBERS. SUSSER THOMAS'S LIFE WAS DEDICATED TO LOCK THOUSAND THE STRUGGLE OF FARMWORKERS UNITED STATES TO IMPROVE THEIR WORKING AND LIVING CONDITIONS THROUGH ORGANIZING. HE KNEW FIRST HAND THE STRUGGLES OF THE NATION'S POOR AND MOST POWERLESS WORKERS THOSE WHO LABOR TO PUT FOOD ON THE NATION'S TABLES WELL OFTEN GOING HUNGRY THEMSELVES TODAY THESE WORKERS STILL FACE THE INEQUITIES. THAT SO SIR THOMAS WORKED ON. SO HARD AND FOR SO LONG THE LOW WAGES THE LACK OF ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE THE INADEQUATE HOUSING AND DISCRIMINATION. AS WE EMERGE FROM THIS PANDEMIC THESE SAME WORKERS HAVE BEEN CALLED ESSENTIAL MEANING THAT OUR STATE CANNOT FUNCTION WITHOUT THEIR HARD WORK AND THEIR COMMITMENT. AS WE CELEBRATE THIS AMERICAN ICON WE MUST NEVER FORGET THAT HE STOOD UP FOR EQUALITY JUSTICE DIGNITY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. WE MUST NOT IGNORE THAT THERE CLEARLY IS A LOT OF WORK STILL FOR US TO DO AND WE MUST RECOMMIT OURSELVES TO LOCK I WAS UP WITH ALL THE ENERGY AND DETERMINATION OF THE GREAT SAYS ARE CHAVEZ. I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT WE BOTH HIGH ON THIS RESOLUTION. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARAMBULA. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED FOR YOUR DESK. THANK YOU I AM. MISTER SPEAKER ALL BEGAN WHEN PEOPLE. GIVE THE LEGACY IS AS A CHAVEZ THE RESPECT IT DESERVES A LITTLE ON THE FLOOR. SO I APPRECIATE THAT YOU KNOW IN REALITY WE HAVE ONE DAY A YEAR- I I'M RISING TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS IN SUPPORT ASSESSOR CHAVEZ TODAY. AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO START OFF TO SAY THE LEGACY OF SUCH A TRAV IS AVAILABLE TO US BECAUSE OF STRONG WOMEN THAT HE SURROUNDED HIMSELF WITH. HIS WIFE HELEN CHAVEZ AND OF COURSE TOWARDS WORK THAT. THE CO FOUNDER UFW WHO REALLY. BOTH OF THEM ALLOWED THIS LEGACY TO BE CREATED SO WE HAVE TO FIRST GIVE THANKS TO THEM AS WELL. BUT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT SAYS HER CHAVEZ IN THIS TIME IT'S IMPORTANT TO REALLY POINT OUT WHAT HE WAS. TERRENAS FOR IT PERHAPS WHEN HE WAS PREPARING US FOR WAS THIS VERY LAST YEAR. WHAT ARE MOST ESSENTIAL WORKERS THE WORKERS TO ENSURE WE HAVE FOOD ON THE TABLE. ARE ABLE TO HAVE SOME PROTECTIONS. HOPEFULLY THE PROTECTION TO BE SAFE AT WORK ALTHOUGH THAT FEEL THIS THIS YEAR HOPEFULLY THE PROTECTION TO MAKE ENOUGH MONEY THAT THEY CAN HAVE ADEQUATE HEALTH CARE AND HOUSING ALTHOUGH WE SAW THE FAILURES OF THAT THIS YEAR. HOPEFULLY NOT THAT THEY HAVE A VOICE ON THE JOB SO THEY CAN ADVOCATE FOR THEMSELVES. OF COURSE WE SAW THAT FIELD THIS YEAR AS WELL. SO IT'S REMINDING US TODAY. AFTER THIS YEAR ONE PANDEMIC. UNFORTUNATELY HOW MUCH WORK WE STILL HAVE TO DEAL. SAYS CHAVEZ SHOWED US WHAT WE NEEDED DECADES AGO. AND WE CELEBRATE THAT EVERY SINGLE YEAR AND WE CELEBRATE WHAT HE STOOD FOR BUT WE SO SELDOM SAY ARE WE TRULY LIVING OUT HIS LEGACY HAVE WE ACTUALLY DONE WHAT HE SET OUT TO DO R. WE'VE JUST CELEBRATING THAT HE TRIED TO GET IT DONE. AND HE DID THE ADVANCEMENTS-THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA FOR FARMWORKERS. OUR INCREDIBLE WHEN YOU LOOK AT OTHER STATES. THAT'S A SAD STATEMENT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED THIS YEAR TO FARMWORKERS THAT'S A SAD STATEMENT BUT IN OTHER STATES FARMWORKERS DON'T EVEN HAVE THE RIGHT TO MINIMUM WAGE THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE THEY DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO PAID. OVERTIME SO WHAT WE STILL NEED TO DO IN THIS COUNTRY TO OUR MOST ESSENTIAL WORKERS. IT IS INCREDIBLE AND THAT'S A CALL FOR ALL OF US HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SMALLER. SO TODAY ON SEVEN CHAVEZ DAY JUST LIKE EVERY DAY I ASK THAT WE DO CELEBRATE HIS LEGACY. BUT WE ALSO ASK OURSELVES WHAT WE'RE DOING TO MAKE IT RIGHT IT IS PROBABLY A SICK JOKE THAT THE SUPREME COURT THIS WEEK. HEARD A CASE ABOUT BASICALLY THE RIGHT TO ACCESS WORKERS IN ORDER THAT THEY CAN LEARN ABOUT A UNION. OF THIS IS A U. CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC CASE BECAUSE ANOTHER STATE THEY DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO JOIN A UNION BUT THIS IS ABOUT ACCESS TO THOSE WORKERS. AND IT'S SAD BECAUSE WE KNOW. WHAT THE SUPREME COURT WILL PROBABLY BE SET BACK AGAIN. BUT SEVEN CHAVEZ TAUGHT US TO NEVER QUIT FIGHTING IN WE WOULD BE. WRONG TO SUGGEST THAT WE HAVEN'T MADE A VAMP SMITH'S TODAY I JUST HOPE YOU'LL JOIN ME AS MY POST ON SOCIAL MEDIA MAYBE SHOW FOR BREAKFAST IN YOUR COMMUNITY. CELEBRATES AS A CHAVEZ DO IT IN A WAY THAT REALLY DOES. HE RESPECTED HIS LEGACY AND SAYING WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO NEXT THIS PANDEMIC ED CHAU SHOWN US OUR SHORTFALLS WHEN IT COMES TO ESPECIALLY LATINO IMMIGRANT WORKERS. AND WE HAVE TO DO MORE. AND SO ON THE SETS ARE CHAVEZ DAY HOPE YOU'LL VOTE YES AND THINK ABOUT WHAT ELSE WE CAN DO. OKAY THANK YOU MISS GONZALEZ MR LEAD YOU ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE REAR CHAMBER. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LGBT Q. CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF HR TWENTY NINE POLICIES IT WILL SERVE OUR SERVICE STOOD FOR THE WORKER HE ALSO STOOD AS A LEADER IN SUPPORTING LGBTQ PLUS RIGHT. LONG BEFORE IS POPULAR TO DO SO. HE UNDERSTOOD THAT YOU DEBT YOU CAN'T DEMAND EQUALITY FOR YOUR OWN PEOPLE WELL TOLERATE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST ANYONE ELSE CHáVEZ BELIEVE THAT IF ANY MINORITIES OPPRESSED WE ARE ALL RIGHT. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN CHAVEZ ATTENDED AND SPOKE AT THE SECONDNATIONAL MARCH ON WASHINGTON FOR LESBIAN AND GAY RIGHTS HE LED MARCHES BOYCOTTS OF HUNGER STRIKES HE CHALLENGE PEOPLE TO BEGIN QUESTIONING WHERE THEIR FOOD CAME FROM AND WHETHER THE WORKERS PICKING THE FOOD. WE'RE TREATED HUMANELY. THE EFFORTS OF SUCH ARE SERVICE OR REMINDER THAT TOGETHER WE CAN BREAK DOWN BARRIERS IT'S ONLY IN UNITY THAT WE CAN WORK TOWARDS EQUITY INCLUSION FOR ALL PEOPLE I HOPE YOU'LL JOIN US IN SUPPORTING.

AS RELATIVELY NEW IMMIGRANTS JEWISH TRADE WORKERS PLAYED AN INTEGRAL ROLE IN THE RISE OF LABOR IN THE NOT LATE NINETEENTH AND EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY. JEWISH LABOUR ACTIVIST SAMUEL GOMPERS WAS THE FIRST PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR RUNNING THE UNION FOR ALMOST FORTY YEARS AT THE SAME TIME THE UNITED HEBREW TRADES BUILT ITS POWER COUNTY. ONE HUNDRED AND SIX JEWISH UNIONS UNDER ITS UMBRELLA. SURE ENOUGH WHEN SAYS HER FATHER STARTED ORGANIZING TO FIGHT DEPRESSION OF LATINO FARMWORKERS MANY JEWISH LEADERS ROSE TO HIS SIDE. IN SOLIDARITY SEVERAL ORTHODOX RABBIS URGE THEIR CONGREGATIONS NOT TO BUY NINE UNION GREATS DECLARING THEIR THEM OCEAN. UNCLEAN BECAUSE THEY CAME FROM EXPLOITED LABOR. RABBI JOSEPH GLAZER EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE NOT A CENTRAL CONFERENCE OF AMERICAN RABBIS SAID. UNTIL THE PEOPLE WHO STOOPED AND SPOT GO THROUGH ALL KINDS OF HELL OUT THERE IN THE FIELD ARE TREATED RIGHT. THOSE GREAT OUR TRADE OR UNCLEAN. MEANING NOT KOSHER TRAGICALLY SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD MAN FRIEDMAN. A YOUNG JEWISH WOMAN WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO LOSE THEIR LIFE. ON A FARM WORKER PICKET LINE SHE WAS A COLLEGE STUDENT FROM BOSTON WHO TRAVEL TO FLORIDA TO JOIN THE STRIKE AGAINST. HOUSE MENSUR COMPANY AND WAS KILLED BY A TRUCK CRASH IN THE PICKET LINE.

THE WORK HE DID ADVOCATING FOR FARMWORKERS RIGHTS WAS REALLY A FIGHT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. THE RIGHT TO LIVE WITHOUT OPPRESSION THE RIGHT TO WORK WITHOUT HARM AND THE RIGHT TO BE TREATED AS ANY OTHER HUMAN BEING. BECAUSE OF HIS WORK HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF FARM WORKERS.
