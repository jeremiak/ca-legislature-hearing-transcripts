00:51:35.759 --> 00:51:38.528
COURT A RIP IT CREATES ON ISSUES

00:51:38.595 --> 00:51:40.397
WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT ARE --

00:51:40.464 --> 00:51:41.698
TRYING TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT

00:51:41.765 --> 00:51:43.033
TO FILE ON THE CASE SO

00:51:43.099 --> 00:51:44.868
MISSISSIPPI'S FROM ONE OF THE

00:51:44.935 --> 00:51:46.570
EXAMPLES THAT I WOULD NOT USE IS

00:51:46.636 --> 00:51:48.705
A GOOD EXAMPLE FOR MOVEMENT TO A

00:51:48.772 --> 00:51:49.873
MEDICAL EXAMINER SYSTEM.

00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:51.875
AND THE OTHER THING THE THE NEXT

00:51:51.942 --> 00:51:53.743
ONE IS AN INCREASED COST SO IT

00:51:53.810 --> 00:51:56.313
JUST COSTS MORE TO RUN.

00:51:56.379 --> 00:51:58.048
A MEDICAL EXAMINER SYSTEM

00:51:58.114 --> 00:51:59.416
BECAUSE YOU NEED MORE DOCTORS

00:51:59.483 --> 00:51:59.716

AND THAT.

00:52:01.518 --> 00:52:02.419
SAME MOCKING ACTUALLY LOOKED

00:52:02.486 --> 00:52:03.820
INTO THIS WHEN THEY WERE TRYING

00:52:03.887 --> 00:52:05.188
TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO MEET

00:52:05.255 --> 00:52:06.857
TO MEDICAL EXAMINER SYSTEM.

00:52:06.923 --> 00:52:07.757
AND THEY DETERMINED THAT IT

00:52:07.824 --> 00:52:09.159
WOULD COST OVER A MILLION

00:52:09.226 --> 00:52:11.328
DOLLARS MORE TO A JUST AND STAFF

00:52:11.394 --> 00:52:13.230
COSTS.

00:52:13.296 --> 00:52:15.165
AND TO CHANGE TO THIS MODEL.

00:52:15.232 --> 00:52:18.268
AND THE FINAL THING IS ONE OF

00:52:18.335 --> 00:52:19.536
THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE TALKING

00:52:19.603 --> 00:52:20.670

00:55:12.442 --> 00:55:14.577
OUTSIDE OF THE MONEY ISSUE WOUND

00:55:14.644 --> 00:55:18.248
WHY WOULDN'T A COUNTY WANT --

00:55:18.314 --> 00:55:19.382
TO OR WHAT WOULD THE BENEFIT BE

00:55:19.449 --> 00:55:20.950
NOT TO GO TO A MEDICAL EXAMINER

00:55:21.017 --> 00:55:23.553
MODEL [inaudible]

00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:24.654
WELL [inaudible]

00:55:24.721 --> 00:55:26.356
THE BIT.

00:55:26.423 --> 00:55:27.390
THE BENEFIT OF COURSE YES IS

00:55:27.457 --> 00:55:28.825
COST -- WHEN

00:55:28.892 --> 00:55:30.326
YOU START TALKING ABOUT --

00:55:30.393 --> 00:55:31.661
EMPLOYING DOCTORS TO DO

00:55:31.728 --> 00:55:33.663
ADMINISTRATIVE WORK AND THAT'S

00:55:33.730 --> 00:55:35.331
QUITE EXPENSIVE WHEN THEY MAKE A

00:55:35.398 --> 00:55:39.002
LOT MORE THAN ADMINISTRATOR --

00:55:39.069 --> 00:55:40.503
I CAN'T SAY THAT ANY COUNTY

00:55:40.570 --> 00:55:41.805
SHOULD DO ONE THING OR THE OTHER

00:55:41.871 --> 00:55:43.540
I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT ONE SYSTEM

00:55:43.606 --> 00:55:44.541
IS BETTER THAN THE OTHER I MIGHT

00:55:44.607 --> 00:55:46.076
TELL YOU THAT.

00:55:46.142 --> 00:55:47.310
WHAT I'LL TELL YOU THAT IT TELL

00:55:47.377 --> 00:55:50.046
YOU IS IF THE SYSTEM IS GOOD?

00:55:50.113 --> 00:55:52.015
AND THEY'RE UNBIASED AND THEY'RE

00:55:52.082 --> 00:55:53.049
DOING THE JOB THAT THEY'RE

00:55:53.116 --> 00:55:54.417
SUPPOSED TO BE DOING IT DOESN'T

00:55:54.484 --> 00:55:55.051
MATTER IF THEY'RE CALLED CHAIR

00:55:55.118 --> 00:55:57.153
OF CORNER MEDICAL EXAMINER OR

00:55:57.220 --> 00:55:59.022
CORNER LIKE IBM.

00:55:59.089 --> 00:56:01.257
IT IT JUST DEPENDS ON THE AGENCY.

00:56:01.324 --> 00:56:02.392
NOT WHICH IS A PERFECT SEGUE

00:56:02.459 --> 00:56:03.760
INTO MY NEXT QUESTION IF I MAY

00:56:03.827 --> 00:56:05.361
CHAIR.

00:56:05.428 --> 00:56:06.663
AND THAT IS --

00:56:06.730 --> 00:56:08.565
TO GO TO THE PRESENTER.

00:56:08.631 --> 00:56:09.999
AND ASKED --

00:56:10.066 --> 00:56:11.501
THE QUESTION AND I BELIEVE IT'S

00:56:11.568 --> 00:56:12.569
ALREADY BEEN STIPULATE OR AT

00:56:12.635 --> 00:56:14.471
LEAST SET A COUPLE TIMES.

00:56:14.537 --> 00:56:15.004
BUDGET --

00:56:15.071 --> 00:56:17.240
THE COUNTIES ALREADY HAVE THE

00:56:17.307 --> 00:56:19.743
OPTION TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO

00:56:19.809 --> 00:56:21.144
STICK WITH THE CORNER --

00:56:21.211 --> 00:56:24.080
MODEL OR MEDICAL EXAMINERS.

00:56:24.147 --> 00:56:26.116
SO THAT THAT IS TRUE AND I WOULD

00:56:26.182 --> 00:56:27.684
POINT OUT THAT --

00:56:27.751 --> 00:56:28.985
PART OF THE REASON FOR THIS BILL

00:56:29.052 --> 00:56:31.087
IS TO TRY TO ENSURE A MORE EQUAL

00:56:31.154 --> 00:56:31.955
JUSTICE IN THE STATE OF

00:56:32.021 --> 00:56:33.990
CALIFORNIA SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU OR

00:56:34.057 --> 00:56:34.991
YOUR LOVED.

00:56:35.058 --> 00:56:36.760
ONE ARE SOMEHOW A INCIDENT

00:56:36.826 --> 00:56:39.295
HAPPENED AND AT THAT COUNTY --

00:56:39.362 --> 00:56:40.864
MAYBE YOU'RE TRAVELING --

00:56:40.930 --> 00:56:41.664
MAYBE THEY'LL LIVE ANOTHER

00:56:41.731 --> 00:56:42.565
COUNTY.

00:56:42.632 --> 00:56:44.667
AND YOU ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE

00:56:44.734 --> 00:56:45.869
YOU -- AND

00:56:45.935 --> 00:56:47.737
AND THE PORTION OF THE STATE

00:56:47.804 --> 00:56:49.239
WHICH IS ACTUALLY FORD THERE'S A

00:56:49.305 --> 00:56:50.774
SHARP CORNER NOW.

00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:52.275
AND LAW ENFORCEMENT WERE

00:56:52.342 --> 00:56:54.210
POTENTIAL IS INVOLVED YOUR AND

00:56:54.277 --> 00:56:56.579
THE ESSENTIALLY THE HEAD LAW

00:56:56.646 --> 00:56:58.581
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL THAT COUNTY

00:56:58.648 --> 00:56:59.182
IS THE ONE WHO'S IN CHARGE OF

00:56:59.249 --> 00:57:02.051
THE WARNER ARE A CHARGE OF THE

00:57:02.118 --> 00:57:03.052
PART OF THE FORENSIC

00:57:03.119 --> 00:57:03.987
PATHOLOGISTS PERFORMING THOSE

00:57:04.053 --> 00:57:06.222
AUTOPSIES [inaudible]

00:57:06.289 --> 00:57:08.658
SO -- THAT

00:57:08.725 --> 00:57:10.226
CAN IMMEDIATELY RAISE QUESTIONS

00:57:10.293 --> 00:57:12.028
ABOUT WHAT WHAT IS THE A

00:57:12.095 --> 00:57:14.164
CONFLICT OF INTEREST ISSUES.

00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:15.698
AND UNFORTUNATELY WHAT HAPPENED

00:57:15.765 --> 00:57:18.334
SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY --

00:57:18.401 --> 00:57:20.103
ACTUALLY TOOK THE RESIGNATION OF

00:57:20.170 --> 00:57:21.404
THE FORENSIC PATHOLOGY STYLISH

00:57:21.471 --> 00:57:23.072
TO POINT OUT THAT I'M CURRENTLY

00:57:23.139 --> 00:57:24.274
COUNTIES WHETHER YOU HAVE A

00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:25.408
SHARP CORNER NOT ACCURATELY

00:57:25.475 --> 00:57:26.242
HIGHER PRINCIPLE KNOWLEDGE

00:57:26.309 --> 00:57:27.610
THROUGH THE WORK BECAUSE THAT'S

00:57:27.677 --> 00:57:29.045
WHO HAS TO DO IT SO WE HAVE.

00:57:29.112 --> 00:57:30.513
YOU READY HAVE PRINTS IT BUT

00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:31.047
I'LL JUST WORKING FOR THE

00:57:31.114 --> 00:57:32.749
COUNTIES ALRIGHT THAT THAT'S HIS

00:57:32.816 --> 00:57:34.818
PERFORMING THE AUTOPSIES.

00:57:34.884 --> 00:57:36.386
SO LET'S LET'S NOT CONFLATE AT

00:57:36.452 --> 00:57:37.921
ISSUE OKAY SO YOU REALLY HAVE

00:57:37.987 --> 00:57:39.522
THEM THEIR YURI PAYING FOR THEM.

00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:40.990
AND THEN THE ISSUE IS IS THAT

00:57:41.057 --> 00:57:43.660
WHEN THEY'RE PERFORMING THE EXAM --

00:57:43.726 --> 00:57:45.628
IS SOMEONE SITTING THERE --

00:57:45.695 --> 00:57:46.963
BASICALLY SAYING NO YOU CAN'T DO

00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:49.032
THAT TEST BECAUSE WE WANT TO PAY

00:57:49.098 --> 00:57:50.767
FOR IT ALRIGHT BUT THAT TEST IS

00:57:50.834 --> 00:57:51.334
NECESSARY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

00:57:51.401 --> 00:57:52.435
REALLY HAPPENED.

00:57:52.502 --> 00:57:55.205
OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY SAY OH

00:57:55.271 --> 00:57:56.439
WELL YOU KNOW YOU'RE REPORT WE A

00:57:56.506 --> 00:57:57.574
CHEESE REPORT IN FACT THIS

00:57:57.640 --> 00:57:59.108
ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN.

00:57:59.175 --> 00:57:59.909
SAN WE CAN --

00:57:59.976 --> 00:58:01.778
SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY NOW SOMEBODY

00:58:01.845 --> 00:58:02.912
WILL SAY WELL IT'S JUST TEN

00:58:02.979 --> 00:58:04.180
WORKING COUNTY BUT IT'S NOT JUST

00:58:04.247 --> 00:58:05.048
SAN JOAQUIN.

00:58:05.114 --> 00:58:06.783
AND THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT THE

00:58:06.850 --> 00:58:08.284
FORENSIC PATHOLOGIST OUR

00:58:08.351 --> 00:58:10.286
EMPLOYEES AND SINCE MOST OF THE

00:58:10.353 --> 00:58:12.088
STATE ITS SHARE OF CORNERS.

00:58:12.155 --> 00:58:13.556
AND THEY SAY SOMETHING I MEAN

00:58:13.623 --> 00:58:15.625
THAT'S WHY THE THE US THAT THAT

00:58:15.692 --> 00:58:16.693
THE DEFENSE PATHOLOGIST AND

00:58:16.759 --> 00:58:18.361
SEVENTEEN WEBSITE BEFORE THEY

00:58:18.428 --> 00:58:20.430
WERE ABLE TO SPEAK OUT.

00:58:20.496 --> 00:58:21.464
BECAUSE I MEAN THAT'S WE HAVE TO

00:58:21.531 --> 00:58:22.632
TELL PEOPLE TO DO IS RISK YOUR

00:58:22.699 --> 00:58:24.100
CAREER RESIGN BEFORE YOU CAN SAY

00:58:24.167 --> 00:58:25.635
SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT GOING TO

00:58:25.702 --> 00:58:26.603
HEAR A WHOLE LOT OF THE SOME

00:58:26.669 --> 00:58:27.971
PUBLIC.

00:58:28.037 --> 00:58:29.839
UP BUT I'VE HEARD FROM PEOPLE

00:58:29.906 --> 00:58:30.640
MORE PRIVATELY THEY SAID YEAH WE

00:58:30.707 --> 00:58:32.542
HAVE PROBLEMS AND WE HOPE THAT

00:58:32.609 --> 00:58:34.410
YOU CAN FIX THIS AND I THINK

00:58:34.477 --> 00:58:35.645
THAT CERTAINLY.

00:58:35.712 --> 00:58:37.280
I WANT TO BE SURE THAT WHEREVER

00:58:37.347 --> 00:58:38.648
I TRAVEL YOU KNOW IN THE STATE

00:58:38.715 --> 00:58:40.416
OF CALIFORNIA I WANT TO BE SURE

00:58:40.483 --> 00:58:42.986
THAT WE HAVE EQUAL JUSTICE.

00:58:43.052 --> 00:58:44.721
ACROSS THE STATE AND NOT JUST IN

00:58:44.787 --> 00:58:45.822
CERTAIN PARTS OF THE STATE AND

00:58:45.889 --> 00:58:48.124
THAT WHEN THE JURY HEARS A A. S.

00:58:48.191 --> 00:58:50.326
AT AUTOPSY REPORT IT'S ONE

00:58:50.393 --> 00:58:51.127
THAT'S NOT.

00:58:51.194 --> 00:58:53.062
A POTENTIAL YOU KNOW THAT THAT

00:58:53.129 --> 00:58:53.863
THAT DONE BY US IN THAT THERE'S

00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:56.499
NOT A THERE'S NOT A CHANCE FOR

00:58:56.566 --> 00:58:58.501
AYE CONFLICT INTEREST NOW I WILL

00:58:58.568 --> 00:58:59.302
TELL YOU I THINK YOU'LL FOR MOST

00:58:59.369 --> 00:59:00.003
PART.

00:59:00.069 --> 00:59:01.771
MOST OF THE SHARE OF CORNERS ARE

00:59:01.838 --> 00:59:03.506
PROBABLY HOPEFULLY.

00:59:03.573 --> 00:59:05.041
I BELIEVE --

00:59:05.108 --> 00:59:08.544
YELL ARE AT BEING HONEST AND

00:59:08.611 --> 00:59:11.814

00:59:11.881 --> 00:59:12.615
WHERE YOU HAVE.

00:59:12.682 --> 00:59:14.617
A IT YOU KNOW IT'S AN INCIDENT

00:59:14.684 --> 00:59:16.152
HAPPENS WITH THE DEATH.

00:59:16.219 --> 00:59:17.220
AND PEOPLE ARE WAITING FOR THAT

00:59:17.287 --> 00:59:19.055
AUTOPSY REPORT TO TRY TO FIGURE

00:59:19.122 --> 00:59:21.557
OUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

00:59:21.624 --> 00:59:23.559
AND SO WHEN.

00:59:23.626 --> 00:59:24.827
A PERSON WHO'S ACTUALLY IN

00:59:24.894 --> 00:59:26.829
CHARGE CAN CHANGE THE REPORT CAN

00:59:26.896 --> 00:59:28.598
ACTUALLY LIMIT THE EXAMINATION.

00:59:28.665 --> 00:59:30.333
IS THE CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:32.535
OFFICER THAT'S THE UNFORTUNATELY

00:59:32.602 --> 00:59:34.137
UNDERMINES CONFIDENCE EVEN IF

00:59:34.203 --> 00:59:35.204
THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING RIGHT I

00:59:35.271 --> 00:59:36.773
MEAN THAT'S A PUBLIC WELL GEE

00:59:36.839 --> 00:59:37.740
THAT PERSON.

00:59:37.807 --> 00:59:38.741
COULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING

00:59:38.808 --> 00:59:39.042
[inaudible]

00:59:39.108 --> 00:59:42.345
SO JUST REAL QUICK.

00:59:42.412 --> 00:59:44.614
WITHOUT RESPECT A SENATOR AND

00:59:44.681 --> 00:59:46.015
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT THE

00:59:46.082 --> 00:59:48.384
THIS IS SO PROBLEMATIC

00:59:48.451 --> 00:59:49.619
THROUGHOUT THE STATE WITH OUR

00:59:49.686 --> 00:59:51.354
COUNTIES THAT.

00:59:51.421 --> 00:59:54.290
IN ESSENCE IT'S INCUMBENT ON US

00:59:54.357 --> 00:59:56.025
TO TAKE THAT OPTION AWAY FROM

00:59:56.092 --> 00:59:58.194
THE COUNTIES AND MANDATED ACROSS

00:59:58.261 --> 00:59:59.662
THE STATE THAT THEY GO TO A

00:59:59.729 --> 01:00:00.863
MEDICAL EXAMINER.

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:03.199
WELL CERTAINLY IT'S NOT JUST MY

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:03.800
OPINION --

01:00:03.866 --> 01:00:06.035
AS NOTED IN THE PRESENTATION FOR

01:00:06.102 --> 01:00:07.904
DOCTOR MOLLY --

NUMEROUS BODIES.

01:00:09.372 --> 01:00:10.206
HAVE -- WHO

01:00:10.273 --> 01:00:11.708
EXAMINED THIS ISSUE WHICH IS WHY

01:00:11.774 --> 01:00:13.343
WE'RE ONE OF ONLY THREE STATES

01:00:13.409 --> 01:00:14.310
LEFT THAT ACTUALLY HAVE A SHARE

01:00:14.377 --> 01:00:15.845
OF CORNER SYSTEM SIR HAVE

AT LEAST THE BEST PRACTICES THAT

01:00:18.614 --> 01:00:20.016
MEDICAL EXAM SYSTEM AND THAT'S

01:00:20.083 --> 01:00:22.151
WHY I YOU SEE PRETTY MUCH THE

01:00:22.218 --> 01:00:23.453
REST OF THE COUNTRY.

01:00:23.519 --> 01:00:24.821
MOVES TO A MEDICAL EXAMINER

01:00:24.887 --> 01:00:26.389
SYSTEM AND WERE ONE OF ONLY

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:29.025
THREE STATES THAT STILL RETAINS

01:00:29.092 --> 01:00:30.660
OF WHICH OF COURSE SYSTEM FOR A

01:00:30.727 --> 01:00:32.128

STRUGGLING WITH THE SAME ISSUES

01:00:39.769 --> 01:00:41.504
THAT WERE BROUGHT BY MY

01:00:41.571 --> 01:00:43.339
COLLEAGUE AND I GUESS THAT.

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:45.808
THE CLARIFICATION THAT NO MATTER

01:00:45.875 --> 01:00:48.344
WHETHER IT'S UNDER THE CORONER

01:00:48.411 --> 01:00:52.615
OR THE THE MEDICAL EXAMINER THAT

IT'S A FORENSIC PATHOLOGIST IT'S

01:00:54.350 --> 01:00:55.785
AGAIN I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT.

01:00:55.852 --> 01:00:56.986
OF AYE I UNDERSTAND YOUR

01:00:57.053 --> 01:00:58.187
ARGUMENT --

I'M I'M I'M CAN CONVINCE THAT

01:01:00.089 --> 01:01:01.624
THERE'S SOME THERE IS A PROBLEM

01:01:01.691 --> 01:01:02.959
BUT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

01:01:03.026 --> 01:01:04.527
WHETHER THIS IS THE BEST

01:01:04.594 --> 01:01:05.862
SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM AT NIGHT.

01:52:42.822 --> 01:52:44.257
TAXPAYING BASE AND SO IT IS

01:52:44.324 --> 01:52:45.892
CLEARLY CONTEMPLATED AND PART OF

01:52:45.959 --> 01:52:47.427
THAT AND I THINK BY.

01:52:47.494 --> 01:52:48.928
BY OPENING THAT PATHWAY WE

01:52:48.995 --> 01:52:50.363
CREATE A BETTER OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:52:50.430 --> 01:52:51.464
MORE VENDORS TO COME INTO THE

01:52:51.531 --> 01:52:52.832
SYSTEM AND START PAYING THOSE

01:52:52.899 --> 01:52:54.100
TAXES IN THE WAY THAT THEY WANT

01:52:54.167 --> 01:52:55.502
TO AND THAT WE WANT TO FROM A

01:52:55.568 --> 01:52:56.836
REGULATORY STANDPOINT.

01:52:56.903 --> 01:52:57.704
AND THEN THE OTHER REALLY

01:52:57.770 --> 01:52:58.872
IMPORTANT POINT THAT YOU MADE

01:52:58.938 --> 01:53:00.306
WAS AROUND FOOD SAFETY --

01:53:00.373 --> 01:53:01.441
AND THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:53:01.508 --> 01:53:02.942
YOU KNOW WE CAN'T DISENTANGLE

01:53:03.009 --> 01:53:04.144
FROM THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT

01:53:04.210 --> 01:53:05.445
SIDEWALK VENDORS.

01:53:05.512 --> 01:53:06.980
I'M A LOT OF SIDEWALK VENDORS DO

01:53:07.046 --> 01:53:08.047
SELL FOOD.

01:53:08.114 --> 01:53:10.016
AYE RIGHT NOW AGAIN BECAUSE OF

01:53:10.083 --> 01:53:12.185
THESE BARRIERS THAT THEY HAVE TO

01:53:12.252 --> 01:53:13.786
JOINING THE FORMAL ECONOMY.

01:53:13.853 --> 01:53:14.888
ODD THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY

01:53:14.954 --> 01:53:16.156
ALIGNED WITH EXISTING FOOD

01:53:16.222 --> 01:53:18.391
SAFETY REGULATIONS STATE HAS

01:53:18.458 --> 01:53:19.926
SOMETHING CALLED CALICO THE FOOD

01:53:19.993 --> 01:53:21.928
RETAIL CODE WHICH HAS A A ROBUST

01:53:21.995 --> 01:53:23.129
SET OF RESTRICTIONS AND

01:53:23.196 --> 01:53:24.597
REGULATIONS ON FOOD SAFETY.

01:53:24.664 --> 01:53:25.932
THAT APPLIES TO EVERYTHING FROM

01:53:25.999 --> 01:53:27.167
RESTAURANTS ALL THE WAY DOWN TO

01:53:27.233 --> 01:53:28.234
WHAT ARE CALLED MOBILE FOOD

01:53:28.301 --> 01:53:28.968
FACILITIES WHICH WOULD INCLUDE

01:53:29.035 --> 01:53:30.503
SIDEWALK VENDORS.

01:53:30.570 --> 01:53:32.272
AND SO BY OPENING THE PATHWAY

01:53:32.338 --> 01:53:34.307
FOR VENDORS TO FORMALIZE THEIR

01:53:34.374 --> 01:53:36.976
BUSINESS AND TO AND TO TO PLAY

01:53:37.043 --> 01:53:37.944
BY THE RULES THAT THE LOCAL

01:53:38.011 --> 01:53:39.879
JURISDICTION PUTS IN PLACE IT

01:53:39.946 --> 01:53:41.481
WOULD BRING THEM IN LINE WITH.

01:53:41.548 --> 01:53:42.916
THAT SYSTEM AND SO THE BILL ARE

01:53:42.982 --> 01:53:44.450
EXPLICITLY CALLS OUT THE FOOD

01:53:44.517 --> 01:53:45.785
RETAIL CODE.

01:53:45.852 --> 01:53:47.053
AND SAYS THAT VENDORS THAT ARE

01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:48.488
COMING INTO COMPLIANCE WITH

01:53:48.555 --> 01:53:50.123
LOCAL DRASTIC REGULATIONS ARE

01:53:50.190 --> 01:53:52.025
ALSO REQUIRED TO MEET ALL OF THE

01:53:52.091 --> 01:53:53.493
REQUIREMENTS AND REGULATIONS

01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:54.827
IMPOSED BY THE CALIFORNIA FOOD

01:53:54.894 --> 01:53:55.795
RETAIL CODE AND SO IT.

01:53:55.862 --> 01:53:57.664
IT'S A WAY TO GET THE VENDORS

01:53:57.730 --> 01:53:59.299
THAT ARE CURRENTLY OPERATING IN

01:53:59.365 --> 01:54:00.300
THE SHADOWS BRING THEM INTO A

01:54:00.366 --> 01:54:01.501
SYSTEM WHERE THERE BETTER

01:54:01.568 --> 01:54:03.303
ALIGNED WITH THOSE EXISTING

01:54:03.369 --> 01:54:04.904
STANDARDS THAT WE ALL THAT WE

01:54:04.971 --> 01:54:08.107

AND SAFETY PERMITS ALL THE

01:54:24.457 --> 01:54:25.091
THINGS THAT ARE.

01:54:25.158 --> 01:54:28.695

01:54:36.669 --> 01:54:38.972
AVENUE TO GET. TO WHERE YOU WANT

01:54:39.038 --> 01:54:40.206

AND WE THINK THAT THE

02:00:07.500 --> 02:00:08.434
ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTY IS

02:00:08.501 --> 02:00:10.036
ACTUALLY APPROPRIATE AND WE

THAT THE NEEDS BE SOMETHING MORE

02:00:19.445 --> 02:00:20.880

02:00:20.947 --> 02:00:21.981

WE WOULD THINK THAT AT THAT

02:00:31.457 --> 02:00:33.059
POINT IT'S PROBABLY APPROPRIATE

02:00:33.125 --> 02:00:33.693

GOVERNOR IT THEN PASSED

02:10:14.540 --> 02:10:15.707
CHALLENGE IN COURT AS BEING

02:10:15.774 --> 02:10:16.742
UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

02:10:16.808 --> 02:10:18.310
A AND IT HAS BEEN IN EFFECT

02:10:18.377 --> 02:10:19.711
SINCE THEN AND I THINK IN

02:10:19.778 --> 02:10:21.413
LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL HAS RENDERED

02:10:21.480 --> 02:10:22.648
A SIMILAR OPINION AND I BUT I

02:10:22.714 --> 02:10:24.516
THINK THE IMPORTANT THING ABOUT

02:10:24.583 --> 02:10:25.884
THAT BILL AND ITS HISTORY AS IT

02:10:25.951 --> 02:10:27.186
WORKS.

02:10:27.252 --> 02:10:28.854
I'VE SPOKEN WITH PLASTER COUNTY

02:10:28.921 --> 02:10:30.355

THE INFORMATION WHICH WAS

RECEIVED FROM LAST GOES DATED

02:10:38.830 --> 02:10:39.331
AND FACT IS CURRENTLY OUT OF

02:10:39.398 --> 02:10:40.732
DATE.

02:10:40.799 --> 02:10:42.000
UNDER THE CURRENT BUSINESS PLAN

02:10:42.067 --> 02:10:45.637
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND THE CST.

02:10:45.704 --> 02:10:47.372
I'M ARE SELF SUPPORTING.

02:10:47.439 --> 02:10:48.874
IT IS TRUE THAT WE'VE GAINED A

02:10:48.941 --> 02:10:51.210
LOT OF MONEY RECENTLY TO TO THE

02:10:51.276 --> 02:10:52.811
SERVICE OF STRIKE FORCES.

02:10:52.878 --> 02:10:55.047
WE HAVE SENT AMOUNT I THINK

02:10:55.113 --> 02:10:55.647
TWENTY ONE TIMES IN THE LAST

02:10:55.714 --> 02:10:56.381
SEASON.

02:10:56.448 --> 02:10:58.884
ARE WE ARE TOLD BY THE PEOPLE

02:10:58.951 --> 02:11:00.252
WHO MONITOR THESE THINGS THAT

02:11:00.319 --> 02:11:01.753
THIS YEAR IS LIKELY TO BE WORSE

02:11:01.820 --> 02:11:03.055
THAN LAST YEAR.

02:11:03.121 --> 02:11:03.956
AND AS A RESULT OF THAT WILL

02:11:04.022 --> 02:11:04.823
PROBABLY BE SENDING OUT MORE

02:11:04.890 --> 02:11:06.525
STRIKE TEAMS.

02:11:06.592 --> 02:11:08.293
HOWEVER ALTHOUGH THAT MONEY IS

02:11:08.360 --> 02:11:09.695
CERTAINLY WELCOME AND IT

02:11:09.761 --> 02:11:10.862
CERTAINLY LEFT US WITH A FAT

02:11:10.929 --> 02:11:12.030
BANK ACCOUNT.

02:11:12.097 --> 02:11:13.298
WHICH WE CAN SO THAT WE CAN DO

02:11:13.365 --> 02:11:15.367
ANY EMPTY THAT SHARE IT IS NOT

02:11:15.434 --> 02:11:17.302
NECESSARY FOR THE CST TO RUN.

02:11:17.369 --> 02:11:19.671
WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THE

02:11:19.738 --> 02:11:21.640
COMMUNITY IS NUMBER ONE WITHOUT

02:11:21.707 --> 02:11:23.442
THAT FIRE DEPARTMENT THE CABIN

02:11:23.508 --> 02:11:24.009
OWNERS WILL BE UNABLE TO GET

02:11:24.076 --> 02:11:26.678
FIRE INSURANCE.

02:11:26.745 --> 02:11:28.280
THE COMMUNITY WILL HAVE TO DO

02:11:28.347 --> 02:11:30.249
WHAT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP GOING.

02:11:30.315 --> 02:11:31.049
AND THE COMMUNITY HAS

02:11:31.116 --> 02:11:33.118
DEMONSTRATED ITS WILLINGNESS TO

02:11:33.185 --> 02:11:34.653
VOTE FOR IT INCREASED A

02:11:34.720 --> 02:11:35.187
ASSESSMENTS FOR THE FIRE

02:11:35.254 --> 02:11:36.188
DEPARTMENT.

02:11:36.255 --> 02:11:38.123
AS WE'VE GONE THROUGH IT.

02:11:38.190 --> 02:11:39.625
BUT THEY DO SO BECAUSE THEY

02:11:39.691 --> 02:11:40.826
UNDERSTAND THAT EVERYONE ELSE

02:11:40.892 --> 02:11:41.460
WILL BE REQUIRED TO DO THE SAME

02:11:41.526 --> 02:11:42.327
THING.

02:11:42.394 --> 02:11:44.963
IT PASSES TAX SORT SHARED

02:11:45.030 --> 02:11:46.665
EQUALLY AMONGST THE COMMUNITY IF

02:11:46.732 --> 02:11:48.066
THERE'S NO CST.

LOW INCOME AND MODERATE INCOME

02:23:08.212 --> 02:23:09.614
PEOPLE AS WELL WHO ARE THE

02:23:09.681 --> 02:23:11.249
PRIMARY USERS OF THE TRANSIT

02:23:11.316 --> 02:23:12.984

WHICH LOW AND MODERATE INCOME

02:23:25.596 --> 02:23:27.165
PEOPLE COMMIT PART OF THAT.

02:23:27.231 --> 02:23:27.765
FUTURE AS WELL SINCE THEY ARE

02:23:27.832 --> 02:23:32.770
THE A BASE OF RIDERSHIP FOR THE

FOR ABOUT THE SYSTEM AND FRANKLY

02:23:37.742 --> 02:23:39.410
FOR EQUINOX COMMUNITIES THAT WE

02:23:39.477 --> 02:23:40.611
FOR PROVIDE A STRATEGY.

02:23:40.678 --> 02:23:42.580
STARKLY TAX EGGMAN FINANCING HAS

02:23:42.647 --> 02:23:44.782
BEEN A MAJOR PART OF THE TOOLS

02:23:44.849 --> 02:23:45.650
THAT THE STATE AND LOCAL

THE CASE IN THE FUTURE.

02:23:52.323 --> 02:23:53.858
BUT WE SHOULD MAKE EFFORTS TO

02:23:53.925 --> 02:23:56.561
ENSURE THAT IT IS CONCENTRATED

02:23:56.627 --> 02:23:58.563
TO THE EXTENT WHERE ABLE --

02:23:58.629 --> 02:24:00.698
AROUND TRANSIT SYSTEMS THE STATE

02:24:00.765 --> 02:24:02.467

02:24:04.736 --> 02:24:06.504
REDUCTION GOALS THAT THIS WOULD

02:24:06.571 --> 02:24:08.206
