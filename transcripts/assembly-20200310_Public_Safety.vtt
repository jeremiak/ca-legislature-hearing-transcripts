FROM ANTHONY THIS I

00:53:00.210 --> 00:53:02.012
UNFORTUNATELY WILL NOT BE ABLE

00:53:02.078 --> 00:53:05.615
TO VOTE ON THIS BILL RIGHT NOW-

00:53:05.682 --> 00:53:07.150
BECAUSE OF A NUMBER OF CONCERNS

00:53:07.217 --> 00:53:09.986
THAT WERE RAISED BY- BOTH THE

00:53:10.053 --> 00:53:12.088
ACLU. AND THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S

00:53:12.155 --> 00:53:14.824
ASSOCIATION- SEXUAL ASSAULT IS

00:53:14.891 --> 00:53:16.626
VERY REAL ON CAMPUSES I THINK

00:53:16.693 --> 00:53:18.261
ANYONE WHO'S SEEN THE MOVIE THE

00:53:18.328 --> 00:53:20.230
HUNTING GROUND KNOWS. THAT

00:53:20.297 --> 00:53:22.165
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES NEED

00:53:22.232 --> 00:53:23.800
TO UP THEIR GAME WITH REGARDS

00:53:23.867 --> 00:53:25.769
TO POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND

00:53:25.835 --> 00:53:27.470
ENFORCEMENT AND RECOGNIZE THE

00:53:27.537 --> 00:53:29.839
BOX THAT IS IN HERE IN A LOT

00:53:29.906 --> 00:53:31.875
OF- CAMPUS CULTURE MOSTLY

00:53:31.942 --> 00:53:33.276
BECAUSE OF THE REVENUE THAT'S

00:53:33.343 --> 00:53:35.845
GENERATED FROM SO MANY OF OUR-

00:53:35.912 --> 00:53:37.581
A PROGRAMS THAT ARE ON- THOSE

00:53:37.647 --> 00:53:39.649
CAMPUSES. AND FOCUSING TO GET

00:53:39.716 --> 00:53:41.351
WITH THE PROGRAM HAVING SAID

00:53:41.418 --> 00:53:42.819
THAT I THINK THERE'S A

00:53:42.886 --> 00:53:45.322
DIFFERENCE. BETWEEN THE CAMPUS

00:53:45.388 --> 00:53:47.357
CULTURE AND WHAT HAPPENS

00:53:47.424 --> 00:53:48.658
THROUGH OUR PENAL CODE YOU KNOW

00:53:48.725 --> 00:53:50.994
I REALLY SEE THIS AS A SLIPPERY

00:53:51.061 --> 00:53:56.299
SLOPE AND UNNECESSARY BECAUSE.

00:53:56.366 --> 00:53:58.668
YOUR DISPOSAL YOU HAVE PENAL

00:53:58.735 --> 00:53:59.769
CODE TWO TWENTY YOU HAVE PENAL

00:53:59.836 --> 00:54:03.707
CODE. TWO SIXTY ONE TWO EIGHTY

00:54:03.773 --> 00:54:04.641
NINE TWO FORTY THREE- YOU

00:54:04.708 --> 00:54:07.110
ALREADY HAVE DISCRETION TO

00:54:07.177 --> 00:54:10.246
OFFER IMMUNITY IF YOU WANT AND

00:54:10.313 --> 00:54:12.215
SO TO YOUR POINT YOU SAID YOU

00:54:12.282 --> 00:54:13.750
YOU YOU DON'T NEED TO AND YOU

00:54:13.817 --> 00:54:14.684
SHOULDN'T BE REATING SEXUAL

00:54:14.751 --> 00:54:17.087
ASSAULT VICTIMS AS CRIMINALS.

00:54:17.153 --> 00:54:18.054
YOU SHOULDN'T BE DOING THAT

00:54:18.121 --> 00:54:19.456
ANYWAY THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO

00:54:19.522 --> 00:54:20.757
WITH LACK OF LAW IT HAS A LOT

00:54:20.824 --> 00:54:22.692
MORE TO DO WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:54:22.759 --> 00:54:24.661
CULTURE AND HOW YOU TREAT FOLKS

00:54:24.728 --> 00:54:27.897
TO COME FORWARD- THERE IS A

00:54:27.964 --> 00:54:29.499
CHALLENGE THAT I SEE RIGHT NOW

00:54:29.566 --> 00:54:31.601
AND MAYBE THEY CAN GET AMENDED.

00:54:31.668 --> 00:54:33.470
AROUND EXCLUDING EVIDENCE MY

00:54:33.536 --> 00:54:36.172
MIND I DON'T SEE HOW THIS DOES

00:54:36.239 --> 00:54:36.906
NOT CONFLICT WITH THE

00:54:36.973 --> 00:54:38.942
PROSECUTOR AFFIRMATIVE DUTY PER

00:54:39.009 --> 00:54:40.877
BRADY. AND WHEN YOU'RE LOWERING

00:54:40.944 --> 00:54:42.278
THE BAR FOR CONVICTION YOU'RE

00:54:42.345 --> 00:54:44.414
ALSO LOWERING THE BAR FOR DUE

00:54:44.481 --> 00:54:46.616
PROCESS I HAVE SOME VERY REAL

00:54:46.683 --> 00:54:50.053
QUICK. ABOUT HOW MUCH. I

00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:51.287
INTOXICANT INTERLACED WITH THE

00:54:51.354 --> 00:54:54.290
EVENT I THINK IS VERY REAL SO

00:54:54.357 --> 00:54:55.659
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE

00:54:55.725 --> 00:54:57.027
SUBSTANCES ARE CONSENSUALLY

00:54:57.093 --> 00:54:58.928
SHARED HOW DO YOU PROCEED WHEN

00:54:58.995 --> 00:55:01.064
A VICTIM HAS PRIORS WHAT IF THE

00:55:01.131 --> 00:55:03.199
VICTIM HAS SUPPLIED THE DRUGS.

00:55:03.266 --> 00:55:05.035
IS THE TYPE OR AMOUNT OF

00:55:05.101 --> 00:55:06.603
SUBSTANCE DOES THAT MAKE A

00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:08.638
DIFFERENCE IN THIS SCENARIO I

00:55:08.705 --> 00:55:09.839
WOULD ARGUE THAT IF YOU HAVE

00:55:09.906 --> 00:55:11.307
SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN SUPPLYING.

00:55:11.374 --> 00:55:13.209
YOU KNOW FENTANYL TONS AND TONS

00:55:13.276 --> 00:55:14.644
OF SENTINEL WHICH IS KILLING

00:55:14.711 --> 00:55:17.814
PEOPLE. THAT ACTUALLY IS VERY

00:55:17.881 --> 00:55:20.283
REAL IN A CONVERSATION ABOUT

00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:21.284
CRIMINAL ACTIVITY IT HAS

00:55:21.351 --> 00:55:22.352
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH

00:55:22.419 --> 00:55:24.688
SEXUAL ASSAULT. IN THE IMMUNITY

00:55:24.754 --> 00:55:25.922
THAT YOU COULD OFFER FOR THAT

00:55:25.989 --> 00:55:26.823
YOU ALREADY HAVE AT YOUR

00:55:26.890 --> 00:55:30.927
DISPOSAL- BUT IT PROVIDES US A

00:55:30.994 --> 00:55:33.229
VERY SLIPPERY SLOPE. TWO

00:55:33.296 --> 00:55:34.464
EXCLUDING EVIDENCE AND THEN HOW

00:55:34.531 --> 00:55:35.865
IS THAT SHARED IN TERMS OF JURY

00:55:35.932 --> 00:55:37.634
DESCRIBE DISK INSTRUCTIONS ARE

00:55:37.701 --> 00:55:38.902
YOU THEN MAKING SURE THAT

00:55:38.968 --> 00:55:40.570
YOU'RE TELLING THAT TO THE JURY

00:55:40.637 --> 00:55:42.105
WE ARE EXCLUDING ALL OF THIS

00:55:42.172 --> 00:55:43.106
EVIDENCE THAT COULD BE

00:55:43.173 --> 00:55:46.176
RELEVANT. SO I WANT TO SUPPORT

00:55:46.242 --> 00:55:47.711

WAS THE NOTION THAT THIS BILL

00:57:01.985 --> 00:57:03.920
EXCLUDES EVIDENCE AND LET ME BE

00:57:03.987 --> 00:57:07.190

LET ME. SPECIFICALLY THE

00:57:10.493 --> 00:57:12.162
QUESTION BUT EXCLUDING EVIDENCE

IN THE UNDERLYING. SEXUAL

WITNESS BY THE VICTIM FOR OR

00:57:21.304 --> 00:57:22.272
ILLEGAL DRUGS THAT WOULD NOT BE

00:57:22.338 --> 00:57:23.573
EXCLUDED THE BILL DOES NOT

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:25.642
IMPACT THAT AT ALL WHAT HAPPENS

00:57:25.708 --> 00:57:27.811
IS THE DEFENSE ATTORNEY. FOR

00:57:27.877 --> 00:57:29.679
THE ACCUSED WOULD BE ABLE TO

00:57:29.746 --> 00:57:31.014
CROSS EXAMINE THE VICTIM AND

00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:32.749
ASK THOSE QUESTIONS ELICIT THAT

00:57:32.816 --> 00:57:34.250
EVIDENCE SO THAT THE JURY COULD

00:57:34.317 --> 00:57:35.585
HEAR THE FACT FINDER COULD HURT

00:57:35.652 --> 00:57:37.754
HERE THE ONLY LIMITATION ON

00:57:37.821 --> 00:57:39.189
ADMISSIBILITY. OF EVIDENCE

00:57:39.255 --> 00:57:42.192
WOULD BE IF. THAT VICTIM OR

00:57:42.258 --> 00:57:43.426
THAT TESTIFYING WITNESS WAS

00:57:43.493 --> 00:57:45.595
GOING TO BE PROSECUTED AGAIN IN

00:57:45.662 --> 00:57:48.264
A SEPARATE CASE. FOR USE OF

00:57:48.331 --> 00:57:49.265
ALCOHOL FOR POSSESSION OF

00:57:49.332 --> 00:57:50.867
ALCOHOL FOR USE OF A CONTROLLED

00:57:50.934 --> 00:57:52.969
SUBSTANCE FOR MAP POSSESSION OF

00:57:53.036 --> 00:57:53.903
A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE. THEN IN

00:57:53.970 --> 00:57:56.539
THAT STEP CASE THE TESTIMONY

00:57:56.606 --> 00:57:57.807
THAT THE VICTIM WHAT THE

00:57:57.874 --> 00:57:59.642
WITNESS GAVE AND THE UNDERLYING

00:57:59.709 --> 00:58:01.744
SEX CRIMES CASE THAT TESTIMONY

00:58:01.811 --> 00:58:03.179
COULD NOT BE USED TO BUILD A

00:58:03.246 --> 00:58:05.582
PROSECUTION IN A SEPARATE CASE.

00:58:05.648 --> 00:58:08.051
AGAINST THAT VICTIM WE'RE GOOD

00:58:08.117 --> 00:58:10.420
SAMARITAN WITNESS YOU CAME FOR

00:58:10.486 --> 00:58:10.920
SO I THINK THERE'S A MIS

00:58:10.987 --> 00:58:12.889
UNDERSTANDING OF. THE

00:58:12.956 --> 00:58:14.490
ADMISSIBILITY HOW MUCH LIMIT

00:58:14.557 --> 00:58:18.695
IT'S LIMITED- ONLY IN THE EVENT

00:58:18.761 --> 00:58:20.163
OF A FUTURE PROSECUTION SO I

00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:23.900
THINK THAT ADDRESSES ONE

00:58:23.967 --> 00:58:27.737
CONCERN IS THAT THE A SIMPLE

00:58:27.804 --> 00:58:28.972
PERSON MAY HAVE RAISED.

00:58:29.038 --> 00:58:30.607
CONCERNS TO ADDRESS THE

00:58:30.673 --> 00:58:32.742
SITUATION WELL. THERE HAS TO BE

00:58:32.809 --> 00:58:34.177
IN ON THE ENDING OF THE

00:58:34.244 --> 00:58:35.645
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN USE

00:58:35.712 --> 00:58:38.014
IMMUNITY. ENTRANCE CHANNEL ME.

00:58:38.081 --> 00:58:42.685
TRêN. I WHERE. THE THERE'S A

00:58:42.752 --> 00:58:43.553
NEW GIVEN FOR THE- PROCESS. OF

00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:46.089
THAT. SO IN THE EXAMPLE ASK

00:58:46.155 --> 00:58:47.657
WHAT ABOUT THAT NO WHAT ABOUT

00:58:47.724 --> 00:58:50.059
IF A RAPE VICTIM WAS SUPPLYING

00:58:50.126 --> 00:58:52.095
FAT NOW. AND DURING THE

00:58:52.161 --> 00:58:53.263
UNDERLYING SEX CRIMES

00:58:53.329 --> 00:58:55.565
PROSECUTION THAT RAPE VICTIM

00:58:55.632 --> 00:58:56.866
ADMITTED THAT THERE WAS FAT AND

00:58:56.933 --> 00:58:59.502
ALL PROVIDED THAT WAS THE

00:58:59.569 --> 00:59:00.937
SUBJECT OF THE SEXUAL ASSAULT.

00:59:01.004 --> 00:59:03.973
WELL IN THAT CASE. ONLY IF LAW

00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:05.608
ENFORCEMENT WAS TO INDEPENDENT

00:59:05.675 --> 00:59:07.644
BE ABLE TO BUILD A CASE AGAINST

00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:09.846
VICTIM FOR FAT NO USE OR- OR

00:59:09.913 --> 00:59:11.614
SALES OR IN SOME WAY. THAT

00:59:11.681 --> 00:59:13.216
PROSECUTION COULD GO FORWARD

00:59:13.283 --> 00:59:15.652
ALL THIS LEGISLATION SAYS IS IN

00:59:15.718 --> 00:59:16.552
THE EVENT WHEN YOU'RE

00:59:16.619 --> 00:59:19.322
PROSECUTING THE SEX CRIMES. IF

00:59:19.389 --> 00:59:19.889
THE TRUTHFUL TESTIMONY FROM

00:59:19.956 --> 00:59:22.992
THAT DATA MORE YES- AN- IMAGE

00:59:23.059 --> 00:59:24.694
USE OF THAT IN ALL OR WHATEVER

00:59:24.761 --> 00:59:27.263
LSD OR METHAMPHETAMINE. YOU

00:59:27.330 --> 00:59:29.265
CANNOT USE THAT TESTIMONY IN

00:59:29.332 --> 00:59:32.001
THE SEXUAL ASSAULT PROSECUTION

00:59:32.068 --> 00:59:33.636
FOR SOME SET A SUBSEQUENT

00:59:33.703 --> 00:59:35.438
FEDERAL PROSECUTION SO I THINK.

00:59:35.505 --> 00:59:38.341
THAT UNDERSTANDING OF THE ENTRY

00:59:38.408 --> 00:59:39.776
EXACT. A I THINK THAT THOSE

00:59:39.842 --> 00:59:41.878
CONCERNS AND HOPEFULLY OUR

00:59:41.945 --> 00:59:43.947
ALLIED. THERE WAS THIS OTHER

00:59:44.013 --> 00:59:45.214
REFERENCE WELL THE PROSECUTION

00:59:45.281 --> 00:59:47.016
HAS PLENTY OF THOSE THEY CAN

00:59:47.083 --> 00:59:53.056
PROMISE THE WITNESS. THEY'RE.

00:59:53.122 --> 00:59:54.023
NOT GONNA BE PROCESS. FOR DRUG

00:59:54.090 --> 00:59:55.091
USE WELL WE HAVE MOVED AWAY

00:59:55.158 --> 00:59:55.825
FROM THE THAT IS A CONCEPT OF

00:59:55.892 --> 00:59:57.560
HIP IMMUNITY IDEA THAT THE DA

00:59:57.627 --> 00:59:59.195
IS ENGAGING IN SECRET DEALS

00:59:59.262 --> 01:00:00.463
WITH THE AT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS

01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:01.798
ENGAGING IN SECRET DEALS WITH

01:00:01.864 --> 01:00:02.899
THE WITNESS. THAT DES NOT

01:00:02.966 --> 01:00:04.233
HAPPEN WE MOVED AWAY FROM THAT

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:06.135
WE HAVE A FORMAL PROCESS SO

01:00:06.202 --> 01:00:08.071
THAT EVERYTHING IS TRANSPARENT

01:00:08.137 --> 01:00:09.706
AND SO THIS THIS NOTION OF THE

01:00:09.772 --> 01:00:11.908
PA COULD USE. INFORMAL PROMISES

01:00:11.975 --> 01:00:13.376
PROMISES AND HIP POCKET

01:00:13.443 --> 01:00:15.044
IMMUNITY THAT WOULD BE-

01:00:15.111 --> 01:00:16.546
ANATHEMA TO A PROSECUTOR IN THE

01:00:16.612 --> 01:00:17.914
MODERN DAY THAT IS SOMETHING WE

01:00:17.981 --> 01:00:19.215
WOULDN'T DO THAT IS SOMETHING

01:00:19.282 --> 01:00:21.017
WE DON'T WANT OUR LAW

01:00:21.084 --> 01:00:22.685
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. GOING IN

01:00:22.752 --> 01:00:23.786
TELLING WITNESSES. PRIVATELY

01:00:23.853 --> 01:00:25.088
HEY DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT YOU'RE

01:00:25.154 --> 01:00:26.155
NOT BE PROSECUTED FOR YOUR DRUG

01:00:26.222 --> 01:00:28.124
USE OF. ALCOHOL USE AND SO

01:00:28.191 --> 01:00:29.592
THERE IS A MOVEMENT AWAY FROM

01:00:29.659 --> 01:00:31.461
THAT. IN FACT THE ONLY FORMAL

01:00:31.527 --> 01:00:33.529
PROCESSES IN THIRTEEN TWENTY

01:00:33.596 --> 01:00:34.664
FOUR OF THE PENAL CODE. WHAT

01:00:34.731 --> 01:00:36.232
THE JUDGE WOULD HAVE TO COMPEL

01:00:36.299 --> 01:00:37.934
THE WITNESS TO TESTIFY THE

01:00:38.001 --> 01:00:39.335
REASON WHY THIS IS PROBLEMATIC

01:00:39.402 --> 01:00:40.870
IN A SEX CRIMES PROSECUTION IS

01:00:40.937 --> 01:00:42.939
BECAUSE OF PENAL CODE SECTION

01:00:43.006 --> 01:00:44.140
SIX EIGHTY POINT TWO. IT WAS

01:00:44.207 --> 01:00:45.541
ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO THAT THE

01:00:45.608 --> 01:00:46.576
LEGISLATURE PASSED SIX EIGHTY

01:00:46.642 --> 01:00:47.977
POINT TWO. SIXTEEN POINT TWO

01:00:48.044 --> 01:00:49.912
SAYS. THAT POLICE OFFICERS AND

01:00:49.979 --> 01:00:51.014
NURSES WHEN THEY FIRST COME IN

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.548
CONTACT WITH A SEX CRIME VICTIM

01:00:52.615 --> 01:00:54.150
HAVE TO GIVE A CARD WITH ALL

01:00:54.217 --> 01:00:55.218
THEIR LEGAL RIGHTS. ONE OF

01:00:55.284 --> 01:00:57.320
THOSE LEGAL RIGHTS IS. THAT A

01:00:57.387 --> 01:00:59.022
YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PARTICIPATE

01:00:59.088 --> 01:01:00.523
IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE-

01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:03.092
PROCESS. THAT IS INCONSISTENT

01:01:03.159 --> 01:01:04.794
WITH MY VICTIM LESS POTENTIAL

01:01:04.861 --> 01:01:06.763
CRIMINAL LIABILITY WAS IN THE

01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:10.533
PROCESS AND HAS TO GO TO. THE

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:11.167
TWENTY FOUR MINUTE PROCESS. THE

01:01:11.234 --> 01:01:12.301
ONLY WAY TO FORMALLY PROVIDE

01:01:12.368 --> 01:01:14.504
NEARLY AS WITH A- COMPACT AND

01:01:14.570 --> 01:01:15.538
THE TYPE OF TESTIFIED IN SO

01:01:15.605 --> 01:01:17.206
THAT'S VERY INCONSISTENT. WITH

01:01:17.273 --> 01:01:19.175
THE RIGHTS THAT HE- GIVE OUR

01:01:19.242 --> 01:01:21.144
VICTIMS INTO THE SIX EIGHTY TWO

01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:23.679
POINT CAR POINT TWO CARD. THAT

01:01:23.746 --> 01:01:26.682
DOES THAT WAS- THE STATE POLICY

01:01:26.749 --> 01:01:28.885
AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO

01:01:28.951 --> 01:01:30.453
I HOPE I ADDRESSED ALL OF THE

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.255
CONCERNS IF THERE WAS SOME OF

01:01:32.321 --> 01:01:33.256
THE CONCERNS THAT I DIDN'T I

01:01:33.322 --> 01:01:34.424
CERTAINLY HAVE RESPONSE THEM I

01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:37.026
KNOW THEY WERE COMING COMING

01:01:37.093 --> 01:01:39.829
FAST AND FURIOUS THE CHAIR HAS

01:01:39.896 --> 01:01:41.431
ANY FURTHER CONCERNS. AT

01:01:41.497 --> 01:01:43.399
PRESENT I. DO THAT. AND MEASURE

01:01:43.466 --> 01:01:45.068
BY TAKE THAT AGE YOU'RE CLOSING

01:01:45.134 --> 01:01:47.303
OR PARTY OR THE FOUR DIGIT

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:49.072
WHERE THERE THERE ARE NO OTHER

01:01:49.138 --> 01:01:51.274
QUESTIONS ON YOUR- I WAS. NOT

01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:53.476
DISS HER THIS IS PART OF THE

01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:55.378
CLOSING RIGHT THE CLOTHING. I

01:01:55.445 --> 01:01:57.280
AM SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I

01:01:57.346 --> 01:01:59.348
AGREE WITH AND THE PUBLIC

01:01:59.415 --> 01:02:00.416
DEFENDER'S THAT THIS ONE STOP

01:02:00.483 --> 01:02:02.418
RAPE CULTURE I THINK WE ALL

01:02:02.485 --> 01:02:02.985
KNOW THAT I DON'T THINK THE

01:02:03.052 --> 01:02:03.553
PROPONENTS ARE AT SAYING IT

01:02:03.619 --> 01:02:05.621
WELL BUT THERE'S NO QUESTION

01:02:05.688 --> 01:02:07.790
THAT ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES MANY

01:02:07.857 --> 01:02:09.225
OF WHICH- MANY OF US HAVE BEEN

01:02:09.292 --> 01:02:10.993
WORKING ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:12.261
WE KNOW WHAT THIS. IS NO THE

01:02:12.328 --> 01:02:14.130
THING WOMEN A SENSE THAT THEY

01:02:14.197 --> 01:02:15.665
WILL BE SAFE IN THE CRIMINAL

01:02:15.731 --> 01:02:17.133
JUSTICE SYSTEM MAKE AND THEY'RE

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:18.134
NOT COMPLETELY SAFE IF THEY'VE

01:02:18.201 --> 01:02:19.669
BEEN A WRONGDOER IN OTHER WAYS

01:02:19.735 --> 01:02:21.304
BUT THE SMALL PIECE OF SECURITY

01:02:21.370 --> 01:02:23.139
WILL HOPEFULLY. CHANGE THAT

01:02:23.206 --> 01:02:25.441
CALL IN SMALLEST. BIT SO THAT

01:02:25.508 --> 01:02:27.310
MORE VICTIMS WILL COME FORWARD

01:02:27.376 --> 01:02:28.044
AND FEEL SAFE IN THE CRIMINAL

01:02:28.111 --> 01:02:29.745
JUSTICE SYSTEM. WITH THAT I

01:02:29.812 --> 01:02:31.747
WILL ASK YOU FOR YOUR EITHER.
