OKAY WERE READY TO BEGIN OKAY. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. OF WE'RE HERE TODAY TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TEN FIFTY FOUR THAT'S THE PUBLIC UTILITIES WILDFIRES AN EMPLOYEE PROTECTION. SENATE TO YOUR COMMITTEE TODAY -- MEMBERS OF THIS IS NOT A NEW ISSUE. IT IS ONE WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON FOR MORE THAN A YEAR AND A HALF. LAST YEAR EXTENSIVE DEBATE RESULTED IN SB NINE OH ONE WHICH WAS ALSO INTENDED TO STABILIZE THE FISCAL SITUATION OF UTILITIES. WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN FROM EXTENSIVE HEARINGS REPORTS AND DEBATES AS WELL AS THE GOVERNOR STRIKE FORCE REPORT. AND THE RECENT NINE A ONE COMMISSION. ALL EFFORTS CONCLUDE THAT WE MUST TAKE NECESSARY STEPS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE FISCALLY STABLE ELECTRIC UTILITIES IN THE STATE. WHICH CAN KEEP LIGHTS KEEP THE LIGHTS ON IN ORDER TO PROTECT CUSTOMERS AND OUR ECONOMY. THAT IS THE CRITICAL THING ENSURING THAT CUSTOMERS AND CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. STRENGTH STRENGTH CONTINUE TO BE PROTECTED. THEY WERE UTILITIES ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR ECONOMY AND THE NECESSARY BACKGROUND. OF OUR DAILY LIVES. CLIMATE CHANGE FOR WHICH WE ARE ALL SHARE RESPONSIBILITY HAS CREATED A NEW REALITY IN CALIFORNIA. ONE CONSEQUENCE IS THE WILDFIRES WHICH ARE MORE FREQUENT MORE DANGEROUS AND MORE DESTRUCTIVE. IN MANY INSTANCES UTILITIES OF FAILED TO MAINTAIN THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE RESPONSIBILITY. IN OTHER CASES UTILITIES OF HELD RESPONSIBLE. FOR THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY FILLED INFRASTRUCTURE UNDER INVERSE CONDEMNATION. EVEN IF THEY DID NOTHING WRONG. THESE TWO FACTORS THOUGH HAVE BECAUSE THE BOND RATING AGENCIES TO DOWNGRADE OUR UTILITIES. ONE WENT TO JUNK BOND STATUS AND IN BANKRUPTCY. ANOTHER FACES THE SAME PLIGHT THE SUMMER IF WE DO NOTHING. OTHER UTILITIES PUBLIC AND PRIVATE MAYBE CLOSE BEHIND AS THE MARKET ACTIONS. HAVE A CASCADING EFFECT. THIS LEADS TO INCREASE BORROWING COSTS FOR THE UTILITIES. WHEN THEY BORROW AS MAJOR BUSINESSES DO? THOSE INCREASED COSTS WILL INCREASE CUSTOMERS COSTS BY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY. THEIR ONLY ALTERNATIVE WILL BE NOT TO OPERATE AT ALL AND GO INTO BANKRUPTCY. AB FIFTEEN TEN FIFTY FOUR WILL PAVE THE WAY FOR UNPRECEDENTED SAFETY INVESTMENTS BY THE I. O. USE. WITHOUT PROFIT FOR SHAREHOLDERS FORCE THE AYE ARE USED TO BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR WHILE FIRE SAFETY RECORD AND PERFORMANCE. AND PROTECT CUSTOMERS AND TAXPAYERS FROM HOLY BEARING THE COSTS OF DEVASTATING WILDFIRES. THIS BILL PACKAGE WILL FACILITATE CUSTOMERS ACCESS TO SAFE RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE POWER BY PROVIDING A DURABLE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS ARISING FROM UTILITY BECAUSE WILDFIRES. IN CALIFORNIA. THE BILL'S ESTABLISH A NEW WALL FIRE SAFETY DIVISION INITIALLY WITHIN THE CPUC. NO LATER THAN JANUARY JULY TWENTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THE DIVISION WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE OFFICE OF ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE SAFETY WITHIN THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY. THE BILLS ALSO ESTABLISH PROCEDURES AND STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO CATASTROPHIC WELFARE PROCEEDINGS AND STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. CREATE A NEW PRUDENT MANAGER STANDARD AND ESTABLISH A WILDFIRE FUND AND MECHANISM TO CAPITALIZE THE WILDFIRE FRONT. I'LL NOW TURN. OF THIS JOINT PRESENTATION. OF OVER TWO ASSEMBLY MEMBER A MAZE OF TO BE FOLLOWED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER BURKE -- AND THEN WE WILL -- BRING UP OUR WITNESSES TO TESTIFY. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER HOLDEN. WELCOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER. REYES THANK YOU ARE MISTER VICE CHAIR I DO NOT HAVE A PREPARED REMARKS AT TODAY -- I FIGURE WOULD HAVE SOME SORT OF A DIALOGUE -- WE HAVE NOW SPENT -- WELL OVER A YEAR AND A HALF -- WORKING ON THIS PARTICULAR AT-THIS PARTICULAR ITEM. AND THE ONE THING I I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US -- TO PUT AN EXCLAMATION POINT ON IS THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN ITEM THIS IS NOT A DEMOCRAT PROPOSAL BEFORE US THIS IS NOT A REPUBLICAN PROPOSAL. THIS IS NOT BY PARTISAN I IT IS IT IS AND SHOULD BE A NON PARTISAN. THE TRUTH IS IF YOU WERE TO LOOK AT THIS PROPOSAL WHICH THAT THE GOOD WORK -- THAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THE GOVERNOR'S TEAM -- PUT BEFORE US -- IS -- I THINK -- A A A GOOD PROPOSAL IT IS NOT THE PROPOSAL THAT I WOULD HAVE A THAT I WOULD HAVE DONE IN FACT WHEN I INTRODUCED AB TWO THIRTY FIVE AND BEGAN HAVING CONVERSATIONS -- I WASN'T THINKING THAT THERE IS ANY POSSIBILITY AT ALL -- THAT WE ARE GOING TO GET A UTILITIES TO PONY UP TEN AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS. IN SHAREHOLDER CONTRIBUTIONS. BUT THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US. THAT IS QUITE A FEAT -- BUT TO BE TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE HAVE GOTTEN THEIR I'M NOT SURE OF ANY ONE OF US IF WE WERE TO WRITE A PROPOSAL WE WOULD HAVE COE UP WITH THE PROPOSAL BEFORE US BUT THE PROPOSAL FOR US IS A GOOD. PROPOSAL IS IT PERFECT -- IT IS NOT PERFECT BUT IT IS CERTAINLY GOOD AND IT DOES CREATE SOME CERTAINTY FOR AND SOME FINANCIAL STABILITY. FOR THOSE WHO PROVIDE A LOGICAL SERVICE TO ALL OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AS WE GO FOR BUT AND I'M SURE WILL BE HAVING A QUITE A BIT MORE DISCUSSION HERE AS WELL I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE ALL STUDIED A WE'VE WE UNDERSTOOD THERE'S BEEN. AND I DON'T WANT COMMISSION REPORT HAS BEEN A STRIKE FORCE REPORT THERE'S BEEN SEVERAL BILLS -- TO LOOK FOR THE CONVERSATION. YOU THANK YOU A SERMON MAYES ASSEMBLY WOMAN BURKE WELCOME A AHEAD THANK YOU TERENCE ERRORS UNLIKE MY COLLEAGUES I HAVE PREPARED REMARKS I AM NOT THAT GOOD OFF THE COPS SO -- AB TEN FIFTY FOUR RESPONSE THE ISSUES OF WILDFIRES AND THE ROLE THAT UTILITIES AND OUR STATE PLAY IN THE CURRENT COMMITMENT. IT SIMPLY SN'T ENOUGH TO CREATE A FUND FOR FUTURE FIRES WITHOUT THE FOLLOWING INCREASES AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR UTILITIES THIS BILL WOULD REALLY ONLY SERVE AS A TEMPORARY FIX. TO WHAT IS NOW PROVEN TO BE AN ONGOING PROBLEM. AND TO ADDRESS WILD FIRES IN THE STATE MUST RESULT IN REDUCING UTILITY CAUSE CATASTROPHIC FIRES FROM OCCURRING IN THE FIRST PLACE. THIRD OF THE GOALS OF AB TEN FIFTY FOUR IS TO ACCOMPLISH JUST THAT. THE BILL ESTABLISHES NEW SAFETY AND COUNT ABILITY STANDARDS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF UTILITY BECAUSE WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA. EVER TAKE CALIFORNIANS FROM SHOULDERING THE COST OF FAILED ENERGY SECTOR WITHOUT BACK TRACKING ON THE STATE'S CLEAN ENERGY GOALS. AB TEN FIFTY FOUR AND ITS COMPANION BILLS ESTABLISHED AND NEW WILDFIRES SAFETY DIVISION INITIALLY WITH THROUGH THE WITHIN THE PC. THE WILD FIRE SAFETY DIVISION WILL BUILD SAFETY EXPERTISE AND A WILD FIRE SAFETY ADVISORY BOARD THAT WILL OFFER GUIDANCE TO THE NEW DIVISION. ELECTRICAL CORPORATIONS MUST SUBMIT TO THE WELFARE SAFETY ADVISORY BOARD A COMPREHENSIVE WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLAN EVERY THREE YEARS. WITH AN ANNUAL UPDATE IN BETWEEN THE BOARD WILL THEN MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE DIVISION ON WILD FIRE SAFETY PERFORMANCE METRICS FOR UTILITIES. IMPROVEMENTS A WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLAN AND OTHER SAFETY INITIATIVES AS REQUESTED BY JULY TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE DIVISION WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE OFFICE OF ENERGYINFRASTRUCTURE SAFETY WITHIN THE NATURAL RESOURCES ENERGY. BY AGENCY WHICH WILL HELP ENSURE THAT ALL ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE IS REVIEWED AND ASSESSED BY EXPERTS FOCUS ON DEVELOPING THE BEST PRACTICES FOR WHILE BY A REDUCTION. WITH REGARDS TO THE RESPONSIBILITY OF UTILITIES I USE HAVE TO SPEND FIVE BILLION IN AGGREGATE ON FIRE SAFETY AND MITIGATION OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS AND SHALL HOLDERS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO EARN A RATE OF RETURN OR PROFIT FROM THIS INVESTMENT. UTILITIES WILL BE FORCED TO HAVE MORE ACCOUNTABILITY FROM THEIR WILD FIRE SAFETY RECORD AND PERFORMANCE THROUGH THE CREATION OF A NEW SAFETY CERTIFICATION THAT WILL HAVE TO BE AFTER OBTAIN EVER ANNUALLY IN ORDER TO ACCESS THE FIND CREATED BY. TEN FIFTY FOUR THIS CERTIFICATION IS ENFORCED BY THE NEW WILD FIRE SAFETY DIVISION AND ADVISORY BOARD AND REQUIRE UTILITIES. TO DO THE FOLLOWING T√ÅI EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TO PERFORMANCE STANDARDS CREATE A SAFETY COMMITTEE WITHIN THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS COMPLY WITH THEIR WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS AND PASS A SAFETY CULTURE ASSESSMENT. THE WELFARE RECOVERY FUND ESTABLISHED IN TEN FIFTY FOUR WILL REQUIRE UTILITIES TO SATISFY SAFETY INVESTMENTS AND OBTAIN THE ANNUAL SAFETY CERTIFICATION IN ORDER TO ACCESS THE FIND. OTHERWISE THESE COMPANIES AND THEIR CELL HOLDERS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE. FOR THE FULL COST OF WILDFIRES. CLIMATE CHANGE INADEQUATE MITIGATION EFFORTS AND INVESTMENT AND UTILITY NEGLIGENCE HAVE BROUGHT US TO THIS JUNCTURE AND WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NOT ALL FIRES ARE UTILITY BECAUSE THE REVISION OF AB TEN FIFTY FOUR AND ITS COMPANION BILL ALLOW UTILITIES TO OFFER SAFER AND AFFORDABLE POWER THROUGHOUT THE STATE. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IT ENDEAVOR TO MINIMIZE AND PREVENT UTILITY BECAUSE WILDFIRES FROM HAPPENING IN THE FIRST PLACE. IN DOING SO WE CAN PROTECT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA BECOMING VICTIMS NOT ONLY THE DEVASTATION AND DESTRUCTION THE WILDFIRES IN BECAUSE BUT THE PERFECT. UNPREDICTABILITY OF UTILITY COSTS AS WELL. THANK YOU YOU HAVE TO WITNESSES AND SUPPORT WELL HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IF I COULD MISTER CHAIRMAN -- WE HAVE -- ON A ON A SINUS ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WHO'S HERE WITH US TODAY. AND WE I WOULD LIKE -- TO TURNED TO HER AT THIS MOMENT JUST TO HIGHLIGHT. THE CONCEPT OF THE TWO FUNDS THAT ARE OUTLINED IN THE IN THE BILL. AND THEY WILL CALL UP AS YOU WISH THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU IF I MAY I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNOR AND THE ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS THE COMMITTEE FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS ISSUE AND YOUR MANY IMPROVEMENTS TO THE MEASURE -- AND STRENGTHENING ITS FOCUS ON SAFETY ACCOUNTABILITY AND DOING SO AT A COST THAT SAYS LOADING REPAIRS AS POSSIBLE WITH A GREAT CONTRIBUTION FROM WALL STREET ON THE QUESTION OF THE FUNDS. AS AS THE AUTHORS MENTIONED -- YOU KNOW THE THE MEASURE PROVIDES A SERIES OF OF KIND OF TICKET TO ENTRY INTO FOR REQUIREMENTS RELATIVE TO SAFETY AND RELATIVE TO ACCOUNTABILITY BEFORE -- UTILITIES -- CAN. CAN HAVE ACCESS TO THE CLEAR STANDARDS RELATIVE TO RECOVERY -- GIVEN THE TIMING NEEDED TO PROVIDE STABILITY THE TIMING NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT THE MITIGATION EFFORTS THE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT. THE EFFORTS THAT YOU'VE AUTHORIZES PART OF THE BUDGET -- TO ADDRESS -- FORCE MANAGEMENT TO ADDRESS PREVENTION AS WELL AS EARLIER SUPPRESSION -- IT TO PROVIDE TIME FOR THOSE PIECES TO TAKE INTO EFFECT THE MEASURE PROVIDES. ONE OF TWO DIFFERENT OPTIONS RELATIVE -- TO TO FUNDS TO PROVIDE. RESOURCES FOR PAYING FOR CLAIMS ARISING FROM UTILITY COSTS WILDFIRES THE FIRST -- THE THE DECISION WILL BE MADE WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS OF ENACTMENT OF THE MEASURE. THE FIRST OPTION IS A A LIQUIDITY FUND. WE DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS -- THE OPTION THE UTILITIES WILL CHOOSE BUT IT'S AN OPTION THAT REMAINS AN OPTION FOR MANY IMPORTANT PURPOSES IT BASICALLY. WOULD PROVIDE A LINE OF CREDIT -- FOR PAYMENT OF CLAIMS THAT LINE OF CREDIT WILL BE REIMBURSED BY EITHER SHAREHOLDERS OR UP BY -- REPAIR ASSESSMENT DEPENDING ON WHETHER OR NOT THE UTILITY WAS PRUDENT IN -- IN ITS PRACTICES OR NOT. THE SECOND ALTERNATIVE IS AN INSURANCE FUND -- THE INSURANCE FUND WOULD BE CAPITALIZE FROM TWO MAIN SOURCES IT WOULD BE CAPITALIZE FROM TE TEN AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS IN. CONTRIBUTIONS FROM UTILITIES THAT AS MR MAYES -- RAISED WOULD NOT BE RECOVERABLE FROM RATEPAYERS IT WOULD ALSO BE CAPITALIZED BY AN EXTENSION OF EXISTING -- CHARGES THAT ARE -- THAT REPAIRS ARE PAYING -- SO IT WOULD BE AN EXTENSION OF THE D. W. OR RATE CHARGE -- FOR UP TO TEN YEARS SO THOSE WOULD BE THE TWO PRIMARY. SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR A CLAIM SPAIN RESOURCES THAT WOULD BE. SUPPLEMENTED -- OR THEY WOULD TURN INTO YOU KNOW FROM TWENTY ONE BILLION TWO UP TO FORTY BILLION DOLLARS OF CLAIM SPAIN RESOURCES. THAT BECOMES -- POSSIBLE BECAUSE IT WILL ALSO BE AN ELEMENT THAT WOULD PROVIDE FOR A 40%. LIMITATION ON THAT -- GENERALISES 40% BUT IT COULD BE INCREASE OF THE MINISTER DECIDES NET IS NECESSARY IN TERMS OF REIMBURSEMENTS TO INSURANCE COMPANY FOR SO BEFORE SUBROGATION CLAIMS -- IN THE FUN COULD ALSO PURCHASE REINSURANCE SO THAT PROVIDES BASICALLY A FORTY FORTY MILLION DOLLARS A CLAIM SPAIN RESOURCES. ARE WE ARE FOLKS HAVE MODELED I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT FUND WOULD PROVIDE SUFFICIENT CLAIMS BEING RESOURCES FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS THERE COULD BE ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS. TO THE FONT IN THE FORM OF THE DUCK DOUBLES PAID BY UTILITIES BASED ON THEIR BEHAVIOR SO IF UTILITIES. ARE -- ARE THERE'S A UTILITY BECAUSE WHILE FIRE AND THE UTILITY. DID NOT. YOU KNOW HAD TO HAD SOME -- SOME FAULTS SOME NEGLIGENCE SOME -- THAT WAS NOT AS GOOD AN ACTOR AND THEN THEY WOULD. REIMBURSE THE FUND IF THEY DID NOT HAVE A VALID CERTIFICATE. OR IF THEY WERE WILLFUL ACTIONS THAN THEY WOULD HAVE TO REIMBURSE THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE FIRE SO THOSE WOULD BE ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS -- HAVE I ANSWERED WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR ME TO COVER ALL RIGHT. SO THANK YOU AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU MISS MANNERS HOW DOES. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. WELL HERE'S A RUN. MISTER JONAS RUSHER A WE HAVE IF I COULD JUST INTRODUCE TO YOU ARE. TWO BOB OR OR WITNESSES WHO WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS. THE COMMITTEE AT THIS TIME ARE WE HAVE -- PATRICK MCCOLLUM FROM A FROM THE ASHES. AS WELL AS SCOTT WHICH REPRESENT THE IBEW WORKERS -- WE WOULD ALSO LIKE -- TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GREET YOU AND TO PRESENT THEIR SUPPORT OF POSITION -- REPRESENTS FROM NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL AND IN THE PENDANT ENERGY PRODUCERS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE -- FOR WITNESSES FORWARD. BUT WE'LL KEEP IT BURKE AND LET'S TRY AND THANK YOU THE CENTER MELONES SHOWN HOW TO DO IT. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- PATRICK MCCALLUM REPRESENTING UP FROM THE ASHES. ASHES REPRESENTS THE TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES THAT HAVE LOST THEIR HOMES TO I OWE YOU CAUSE FIRES. IN ABOUT FORTY ONE LAW FIRMS THAT ARE REPRESENTING THOSE VICTIMS -- SO WE ARE SUPPORTING AB FIFTY FOUR BECAUSE AB FIFTY FOUR IS OUR OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE OF US ARE VICTIMS TO PUT OUR LIVES BACK IN ORDER. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY AB FIFTY FIVE TEN FIFTY FOUR IS OUR WHOLE. THAT ALL VICTIMS AND CALIFORNIANS CAN BE SAFER WE BELIEVE WITH THE PROVISIONS ARE IN THIS THIS IS GOING TO CREATE A SAFER CALIFORNIA. WE JUST RECENTLY HAD A MEETING WITH VICTIMS WITH THE GOVERNOR. AND EACH VICTIM TOLD THEIR STORY THE FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS ARE GOING THROUGH BUT THERE'S THEY ARE HERE TODAY TO MAKE SURE WHAT HAPPENED TO US DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE. I WANTED TO ADDRESS THREE QUICK ISSUES I THINK THE UTILITY RELIABILITY HAS BEEN WELL ADDRESSED FIRST OF ALL SAFETY. SO YOU'VE ADOPTED AN SB NINE ALIGN SUBSTANTIAL SAFETY METHODS. JUDGE ALSOP HAS IMPLEMENTED MAJOR SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS CAME FROM TWO OF OUR TOURNEY'S A FIFTY PAGE DOCUMENT THAT WAS ALSO GIVEN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN YOUR STAFF. SO THERE HAS BEEN MUCH TO FOCUS ON THE UTILITIES TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE SAFER AND ACCOUNTABILITY IT'S IN THERE WE STRONGLY BELIEVE IN READING AB. TEN FIFTY FOUR THAT THE UTILITIES WILL BE SAFER AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WITH ACCOUNTABILITY IT'S JUST NOT SOMETHING THAT CAN HAPPEN IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS. THE CALIBER LEE IS THERE TO MAKE SURE SAFETY IS THERE IN THE NEXT DECADE OR TWENTY YEARS. NEXT I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT RATE PAYERS. BUT WE HAVE CAREFULLY READ TEN FIFTY FOUR WE HAVE DONE OUR DETAILED ANALYSIS AND IT'S HIGHLY COMPLICATED. BUT WE BELIEVE THAT IF YOU PASS TEN FIFTY FOUR BELOW BEFORE JULY TWELFTH. IT'LL PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL SAVINGS FOR P. JEANNIE CUSTOMERS. MAJOR SAVINGS FOR EDISON CUSTOMERS. AND IT'S PROBABLY ABOUT FLAT DEPENDING ON WHERE BILLS FOR SB ANY CUSTOMERS AND THAT'S ASSUMING THAT THE D. W. R. CAPITALIZATION IS AN INCREASE NOT A PASS THROUGH WITH THAT. WE BELIEVE THIS IS A SAVINGS FOR OUR RATE PAYERS IN THE LONG TERM -- AND FINALLY FOR VICTIMS. THERE IS LANGUAGE IN THERE. THAT IN TWO WAYS FOR VICTIMS FIRST IT FORCES P. JEANNIE QUICKLY TO GET THE TABLE. NOW THEY HAVE  FIRE SEASON COMING IN THEY NEED TO BE IN THIS FUN THEY NEED TO SETTLE BANKRUPTCY FOR FOR THE GET THEIR JUNE TWENTY TWENTY IS THERE WITHIN IT BUT IT PUTS MUCH LEVERAGE WITH AND IT. WAS ALSO LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THE KIDS ARE ABILITY TO TELL HOW MUCH TO PROPERLY COMPENSATE VICTIMS WITH THEN. SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL THAT TOGETHER WE ARE STRONGLY SUPPORTING THIS BILL WE WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN AND MAYES AND BURKE. SENATORS -- DIED AND HURTS BERGEN HUESO AND HILL THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE FOR PUTTING WHAT WE BELIEVE IS A THE BEST POSSIBLE. POSSIBILITY PROVIDING SAFETY RELIABILITY TORE UTILITY COMPANIES AND RESTORING VICTIMS TO BE HELD THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR MCCOLLUM OF AND ARE GOING TO NOW PLAY LITTLE TRAFFIC CONTROL -- I HAVE A REQUEST FROM A COUPLE THE SENATORS TO LISTEN TO A MISTER STEVE WEISSMAN IS THAT CORRECT. HERE WE HAVE WORKED OUT LAST YEAR WE WORKED IT OUT GERMANY AND TIME HE'S COME FROM DIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. I REALLY WANTED TO SPEAK ROAD ON SEVEN DAYS WHAT EVEN THE INACTION [inaudible] OR WOULD BE. HERTZBERG IS IT POSSIBLE AYE AYE ENTERS GEORGE BUSH PROFESSORS A POSSIBLE AFTER THE SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION YOU CAN COME AND TESTIFY WITH THAT WORK I THINK. I'M EASY TO WORK. WITH ME OKAY. GREAT THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN THE MEMBER SCOTT WHERE SHOULD BE AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS I'M LIMIT MY COMMENTS ONE SECTION OF THE BILL. ONE SECTION ON ON PAGE THIRTY NINE OF THE BILL. GOING OVER TO PAGE. FORTY THE SECTION. EIGHT FIFTY FOUR OF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES CODE THIS IS KNOWN AS THE EIGHT FIFTY FOUR PROCESS. THIS IS EXISTING LAWS. EIGHT FIFTY FOUR APPLIES ANY TIME THERE IS A MERGER. ACQUISITION OR CHANGING CONTROL OF AN INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY FOR A TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY. THE P. YOU SEE HAS. TO REVIEW THAT MERGER TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S IN THE PUBLIC'S INTEREST. THEY HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DOESN'T HARM RATE PAYERS. IT DOESN'T HARM THE SAFETY AND RELIABILITY EMERGENCY RESPONSE OF THE UTILITIES. IT HAS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S FAIR AND REASONABLE TO THE WORKERS OF THE UTILITY. AS WELL AS SEVEN OTHERS EIGHT ITEMS IN TOTAL THAT'S EXISTING LAW IT'S BEEN APPLIED MANY TIMES. WE SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC IN CALIFORNIA EDISON COMPANY. PROPOSED MERGER THEY WENT THROUGH THIS PROCESS. THE P. YOU SEE DENIED THAT MERGER BECAUSE THEY RULED WHAT. IT WASN'T IN THE BEST INTEREST OF RATE PAYERS TO ALLOW THAT MERGER. IS BEING USED RIGHT NOW CURRENTLY IN THE T. MOBILE SPRINT. MERGER THE SAME REVIEW IS BEING APPLIED. ON PAGE FORTY THREE OF THE BILL IS NEW LANGUAGE SUBSECTIONS D. E. N. AT WHAT THAT SECTION PROPOSES TO DO IS ENSURE THAT THAT SAME REVIEW. HAPPENS NOT WHEN THERE'S AN ENTIRE MERGER OF COMPANIES OR SALE OF A COMPANY. BUT MERELY WHEN THEY GO TO SELL CHUNKS OF ASSETS. WHY BECAUSE WE HAVE HEDGE FUNDS NOW THAT ARE CONTROLLING UTILITIES? SO WHAT IF WE HAVE A THE THE EQUITY GROUP OF P. GINNY DECIDES THAT IT NEEDS TO GET A BUNCH OF CASH QUICK. AND DECIDES JUST TO START SELLING ASSETS THAT THE REPAIRS ARE PAID. FOR AT AT RATES THAT ARE UNFAIR TO THE RATE PAYERS OR THE HAVE OTHER IMPLICATIONS. AND WE FRANKLY DON'T CARE IF THAT IS A TRANSFER OF ASSETS TO A PUBLIC ENTITY. OR A PRIVATE ENTITY WHAT'S THE IMPACTS ON REPAIRS ON EMPLOYEES ALL IN THE SAFETY AND RELIABILITY OF THE SYSTEM IF YOU HAVE A HEDGE FUND SELLING OFF CHUNKS OF THE SYSTEM. WHAT'S THE IMPACT OF WE HAVE FOUR OR FIVE CITIES SIMULTANEOUSLY MOVING TO MUNICIPAL LIES AND BALKANIZED THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. SHOULDN'T THERE BE SOME BLUE SKY REVIEW TO MAKE SURE THAT RATE PAYERS EMPLOYEES. THE POOR COMMUNITIES ARE NOT DISADVANTAGED TO RICH COMMUNITIES THAT'S WHAT THIS LANGUAGE PROPOSES TO DO LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF THE TYPE OF MITIGATION THE P. YOU SEE EMPLOYEES IN THESE SITUATIONS. THEY MAY LOOK AND SAY OKAY SAN FRANCISCO IS GONNA BUY THESE ASSETS FOR TEN BILLION DOLLARS. BUT THAT'S GOING TO BE A COST SHIFT TO THE PEOPLE OF NAPA OR THE PEOPLE SANTA ROSA. SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A BILLION DOLLARS OF THAT SALE AND PUT IT OVER HERE. TO HOLD THOSE REPAIRS HARMLESS. ONLY THE P. YOU SEE THROUGH A REVIEW PROCESS CAN DO THAT. IN THE PAST IN MERGERS WHEN TEY FELT THAT THE ASSETS ARE BEING SOLD HAD NOT BEEN MAINTAINED PROPERLY BY THE COMPANY THAT WAS SELLING THEM. THEY MADE MONEY THEY'VE THEY'VE MOVED TO PUT MONEY ASIDE TO REQUIRE THAT MONEY BE INVESTED IN THE SYSTEM AS A CONDITION OF THE SALE. THE ONLY WAY WE CAN PROTECT THE ENTIRE GREETED THE SAFETY THE RELIABILITY THE EMPLOYEES THE RATE PAYERS. AS A CODE SECTION SAYS THE PUBLIC INTEREST IS TO HAVE SOME REVIEW OF THAT TYPE OF OF CHOPPING UP OF THE SYSTEM THAT'S WHAT THAT LANGUAGE DOES AND WE WOULD URGE AND I SUPPORT. I HAVE TOM DOES -- WITH ME WHO REPRESENTS THE TWENTY TWO THOUSAND EMPLOYEES A P. JEANNIE HE HAS AN ISSUE HE LIKE TO RAISE AS WELL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. BRIEFLY -- I ALSO ADDRESS THE THE ISSUE RAISED BY. THE THREE MARES NOW IN THE LAST FEW DAYS -- WITH THE WITH THE LEGISLATURE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN TERMS OF THE THE BILL LANGUAGE WITH THE UC REVIEW FOR A PARTIAL SALE. AM I WEAR MANY HATS THE HAT I'M WEARING RIGHT NOW IS. THE REPRESENTATIVE OF VIRTUALLY EVERY UTILITY WORKER PUBLICLY OWNED -- AND INVESTOR OWNED IN NORTHERN CENTER CALIFORNIA -- AS THINGS STAND WE HAVE PROTECTION AND IN THE UTILITY CODE FROM THE FULL BLOWN MERGER ACQUISITION WE DO NOT HAVE. PROTECTION FOR EMPLOYEES. IN THE EVENT OF A PARTIAL -- SELLOFF -- AND THOSE OF YOU WHO REMEMBER THE PGA BANKRUPTCY IN TWO THOUSAND ONE IT WAS THE INTENTION OF THE COMPANY THERE. TO CHOP OFF HYDRO ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION AND GAS TRANSMISSION. AND INTO A PARTIAL [inaudible] YOU REMEMBER. AND THAT WAS STOPPED AT THE P. YOU SEE -- M. WE WOULD LIKE THAT SAME PROTECTION NOW I THINK. WHAT THE FIRES HAVE DONE IS THEY'VE DRIVEN? THE TRADITIONAL INVESTORS OUT OF THE UTILITY BUSINESS ELITE OUT LEASE OUT OF P. JEANNIE. IT'S OWNED BY HEDGE FUNDS THE BOARD IS HEDGE FUNDS. M. THEIR PLAYBOOK IS FIND ASSETS SELDOM SO WE ARE LOOKING FOR THE SAME PROTECTION THAT OUR MEMBERS WOULD HAVE. ON THE WHOLESALE ACQUISITION OR MERGER FOR THE US SLICE DICE AND SELL -- SIMPLY ENOUGH. THANK YOU YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHALLENGE JACKSON WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL TODAY. THE CAN TO THE VIEW EXPRESSED BY SOMEONE MEMBER MAYES WE WE DON'T THINK THIS IS PERFECT I THINK WE DON'T THINK IT GOES FAR ENOUGH. TO PROTECT CUSTOMERS FROM -- BASICALLY FINANCING A LOT OF THESE COSTS I THINK WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO MAKE GOOD ON OUR CLEAN ENERGY GOALS -- THE PRICE ELECTRICITY DOES MATTER. HOWEVER WE DO FEEL THE STATUS QUO IS -- LEAVING US IN A BAD SITUATION WE'RE SPENDING MORE MONEY SERVICING DEBT THAT'S MONEY NOT SPENT ON RENEWABLE ENERGY. VEHICLE EXTRICATION ALL THIS DOES FOR YOU TO TAKE TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE WHICH IS MAKING THESE FIRES WORSE. WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED THAT THE ABSENCE OF OF THE MEASURES CONTENT IN THIS BILL TODAY WE WILL CONTINUE -- TO PUT TREMENDOUS PRESSURE ON REPAIRS TO PAY FOR THESE COSTS I THINK WE NEED STABILITY. WE THINK THIS MEASURE BRINGS A MODICUM OF THAT BUT WE HOPE THAT THIS BODY COMES BACK TO ENDORSE THE FULL RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE NINE A ONE COMMISSION -- WHICH WE DON'T SEE THIS BILL THANK YOU. JACKSON THAT BRINGS US THEN TO ARE YOU WHAT YOU WANT TO WAIT TO ALL THE WITNESSES OF OKAY THANK YOU. NAME AND WELL YES MONEY JONES OF WITH INDEPENDENT EDGE PRODUCERS AND WE REPRESENT -- ABOUT PEOPLE WHO PROVIDE CLEAN ENERGY CALIFORNIA RELIABILITY -- THE CURRENT FINANCIAL INSTABILITY OF OUR UTILITIES IN CALIFORNIA IS HAVING IT EXTREMELY NEGATIVE A FACT ON BOTH EXISTING -- CONTRACTS THAT THERE'S THREE AND FIFTY CONTRACT OVER THREE UNDER FIFTY CONTRACTS IN THE BANKRUPTCY IT P. JEANNIE WHICH IS A I THOUGHT I WAS ONE OF THE FOUR SO. YOU'RE A I'VE HAD FOR READY. REMEMBER HOLDEN IS ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE FOUR GROUPS AS IT TURNED OUT THAT -- THE IBEW IS HAD TO SPEAKERS DEALING WITH TWO DIFFERENT ISSUES SEWER WITH. MY APOLOGIES ALL OF THAT THAT THAT'S OKAY I'D NOT. THEN I CAN SHUT UP IF YOU WANT IT WOULD BUT ANYWAY AND AN ORGANIZATION AND WILL KEEP THE THE THE DISCUSSION MOVED OKAY I I WHAT I JUST WANT TO IMPRESS UPON. THE THE THE THE COMMITTEE YOU'VE WE'VE DONE THIS BEFORE AFTER THE TWO THOUSAND INTERVIEW CRISIS WE HAD A FINANCIAL PROBLEM IF PEOPLE INVESTING IN PROJECTS -- THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED AB FIFTY SEVEN WHICH PROVIDED A PROSPECTIVE APPROACH TO BASICALLY FOR CARRYING A IN A THAT FOR IT IS BASICALLY A A DID AWAY WITH. AFTER THE FACT REASON MOST OF YOU YOU DO IT UP FRONT CHECK THE BOXES MAKE SURE THAT DATED BACK TO RESPONSIBLE RESPONSIBLY THAT CAN WORK HERE IT IS ESSENTIAL IF WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO INVEST MONEY IN OUR CLEAN ENERGY RELIABILITY IN CALIFORNIA. THAT WE STABILIZE -- THE UTILITY MARKET IN FINANCIAL MARKET RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THE UNCERTAINTY -- IS IS ACTUALLY GOING TO NOT HAVE. AN EFFECT ON EXISTING CONTRACTS BUT WILL PRECLUDE OR COST A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT MORE -- GOLD GOING FORWARD TO MEET OUR CLEAN ENERGY GOALS WOULD URGE YOU -- AND I VOTE THANK YOU.

AND NOW WE'VE GOT A FULL TIME JOB JUST TRYING TO GET BACK TO BASICS WE NOW HAVE A THIRTY YEAR LOAN BECAUSE WE HAD TO BUY SOMETHING ELSE AND DID NOT ACCOUNT FOR THIS. ANYHOW -- THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE STILL STRUGGLING AND FINANCIAL EVEN IF THEY HAVE INSURANCE THAT. I HOPE YOU DON'T FORGET IT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS LAND TRITON ON BEHALF OF CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA AND THE AMERICAN NGUYEN DANDER ENERGY ASSOCIATION BOTH IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU FOR YOUR HARD WORK. HI NATALIE NEXT IMPACT ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA CHART WERE ALSO AN IN BETWEEN ARE WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF AN AMENDMENT OR ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION THAT INCLUDES A POTTER VALLEY PROJECT. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS JOHN ALLEN OPERATIONS OFFICER FOR A PM HOMES OF SANTA ROSA IN PARADISE. AS A BUILDER WHO HAS BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN FIRES WITH WATER TRUCKS AND BULLDOZERS. A BUILDER WHO IS BUILT FIFTY HOMES FOR FIFTY FAMILIES IN THE PAST YEAR IN THE FIRE RAVAGED NEIGHBORHOOD OF COFFEE PARK. AND AS A BUILDER NOW ASSISTING NORTHERN CALIFORNIANS IN BUTTE COUNTY RECOVERING FROM THE CAMPFIRE OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN I CANNOT EMPHASIZE ENOUGH THE IMPORTANCE OF ASSEMBLY BILL. TEN FIFTY FOUR AS IT PERTAINS TO THE RECOVERY OF FIRE SURVIVORS. WORKING HAND IN HAND ELBOW -- ONE YOU PLANNING ON GOING BUT THAT. YOU NEED TWENTY SECOND TWENTY SECOND -- I HAVE WORKED WITH HUNDREDS OF FAMILIES WHO THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN HAD TO BECOME REAL ESTATE DEVELOPERS IN THE WAKE OF CALIFORNIA'S WILDFIRES. BEING A BUILDER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS NO EASY TASK AND FOR THE THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES WHO HAVE NEVER BUILT A HOME BEFORE. THIS TASK OF REBUILDING THEIR HOMES IN SOME CASES IS UNATTAINABLE. REAL RECOVERY STARTS ONCE THEY'RE BACK IN THEIR HOME SO THAT THEY MAY BEGIN REBUILDING THEIR LIVES. THE PASSAGE OF AB TEN FIFTY FOUR WILL ALLOW THOSE FAMILIES TO RECOVER IN A MORE EXPEDITED AND HUMANE MANER THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR NUMBERS CAROLING ON BEHALF OF MARYLAND AND BREED IN SUPPORT OF THE CONCEPT OF THE MEASURE THEY DID SUBMIT A LETTER OF CONCERN REGARDING ONE PROVISION BUT ARE OTHERWISE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT THE BILL IS TRYING TO DO THINK SO MUCH. YOU. MARK TONY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF TURN YOU UTILITY REFORM NETWORK. MOST DIFFICULT. POSITION WE'VE EVER HAD TO TAKE ON A BILL. THERE IS. IMPORTANT THINGS WE DON'T LIKE ABOUT THE BILL BUT THE IMPORTANT THINGS WE DO LIKE WE DO LIKE THE FACT THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME UTILITIES WILL BE REQUIRED. TO MATCH DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR. TEN POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF RAPE HERE CONTRIBUTIONS WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT UTILITIES ARE ALSO GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO PAY INTO WILD FIRE MITIGATION FUNDS. WE ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION IS GOING TO BE LINKED TO FIRE SAFETY. THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS IN THIS BILL THAT. WE DON'T LIKE BUT OVERALL WE THINK THAT THIS BILL IS THE BEST PACKAGE THAT IS IN FRONT OF US NOW. WE ARE RESERVE THE RIGHT THAT IF THIS BILL DOES NOT TURN OUT THE WAY THAT ITS PROMISE THAT IT IF IT DOES NOT PROTECT RATEPAYERS THE WAY THAT IT'S PROMISED WE RESERVE THE RIGHT. TO COME BACK AT THE MAN. LATER ON THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT PROPOSAL WE ARE SITTING ON THE TABLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MARK FENSTER MAKER ON BEHALF OF THIS NUMBER OF CINEMA WATER WERE THE WHOLESALE WATER SUPPLIER FOR CINEMA COUNTY BUT ALSO IN THE TO WINNER POSITION SIMILAR TO CALIFORNIA TROUT. SEEKING -- SOME SEPARATE RESOLUTION FOR THE FUTURE OF THE POTTER VALLEY PROJECT THANK YOU. MICHAEL BOOKER ON BEHALF OF THE AG ENERGY CONSUMERS ASSOCIATION WE ARE ALSO NEUTRAL ON THE BILL SOME OF THE SAME CONCERNS YOU HEARD EXPRESSED BY THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY. ALSO ON BEHALF OF ONE OF OTHER CLIENTS OF SAN JOAQUIN IRRIGATION DISTRICT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS AS IT RELATES TO THEIR ONGOING MUNICIPALS ATION. BUT WE HOPE TO WORK THAT OUT SO -- THANK YOU. BETTER GO TO THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES CESSATION WE HAVE NOT A TIME TO TAKE OFFICIAL POSITION ON THE BILL BUT WANT TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY THINK THE AUTHORS. AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE FOR DRESSING SOME INITIAL CONCERNS THAT WE HAD IN THE PRIOR DRAFT THE BILL WE LOOK FOR TO FOR THE REVIEW. AND WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS AGAIN THANK YOU. AND THAT'S ALL OF THE TWEETERS TO WE HAVE SPEAKERS AN OP -- WE'RE GONNA HAVE. GO TO THE SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION THEN WE'LL HEAR FROM MICHAEL WEITZMAN. OF A SPEAKERS STEVE WEISSMAN I'M SORRY [inaudible] RATHER. I SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION PLEASE. IF WE CAN MAKE SOME ROOM HERE AT THE TABLE. OVER THERE WELCOME TO FEEL LIKE. IF YOU LIKE A FLY YOU CAN SPEAK FROM THE MIKE -- DOES FIND MUCH MUCH TIME. THE INTRACTABLE TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- I APPRECIATE THE DIFFICULT BALANCE OF THIS BILL MY NAME IS WILLIAM ABRAMS -- I AM A WILDFIRE SURVIVOR FROM THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN NORTH BAY WILDFIRES -- AND I REALLY WAS HOPING THAT WOULD BE -- IN THE PREVIOUS LINE -- AND I'M NOT -- THIS CHRISTMAS TREE FOR UTILITIES HAS TOO MANY ORNAMENTS ON IT I TRIED TO REACH OUT. TO MANY FOLKS -- ON ALL SIDES OF THIS ISSUE TO TRY TO GET SOME OF THOSE ORNAMENTS OFF THE TREE BUT THEY'RE STILL ON THERE THERE IS LESS OVERSIGHT. AND LESS ACCOUNTABILITY IN THIS BILL THEN CURRENT STATE. THERE IS LESS TRANSPARENCY IN THIS CURRENT BILL THEN CURRENT STATE. THERE IS LOOPHOLES PUT INTO THIS BILL THAT THE UTILITIES AND THEIR ATTORNEYS WILL DRIVE TRUCKS THROUGH. I WANT TO BE IN THE OTHER LINE I CANNOT SUPPORT THIS BILL AND MAKES BREAKS MY HEART. THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE. WHO ARE AFFECTED BY THE FIRES THAT -- THEY NEED THE MONEY. AND I UNDERSTAND AND I SYMPATHIZE WITH THE FOLKS WHO ARE ON THAT SIDE AND I WANT TO BE THERE BUT I CANNOT IN GOOD CONSCIOUS SUPPORT THE BILL. ON THE BACKS OF FUTURE WILDFIRES SURVIVORS AND THAT'S WHAT THIS DOES. THIS LESSONS ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE UTILITIES. AND IT HOLDS THEM TO A LOWER STANDARD. THERE WAS A QUOTE FROM THE STRIKE FORCE REPORT HOW THAT WAS RELIED UPON FOR THE CREATION OF THIS BILL LET ME QUOTE THE STRIKE FORCE REPORT. THIS SHOULD BE BASED UPON THE SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE BASED RISK MITIGATION METRICS THAT ARE INDEPENDENTLY AND SCIENTIFICALLY VERIFIED. NOTHING CLOSE TO THAT AND THIS BILL THIS IS GENERALITIES OF A REASONABLE LIST WITH CAVIAR IT'S THERE ARE MADE FOR THE UTILITIES TO DRIVE TRUCKS THROUGH THESE PROVISIONS. THIS IS NO WHERE CLOSE TO WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE IT'S ONE THING I WAS PERFECTLY FINE WITH IT ANYBODY STEP FORWARD THIS AIN'T THAT THIS IS STEPS BACK. WE CAN'T TAKE STEPS BACK FROM THIS THE ONLY THING THAT'S GOING TO HELP THE UTILITIES I HOPE TO IMPROVE THEIR CREDIT RATING WHICH I WOULD LOVE. AS THEY GET PERFORMANCE BATES METRICS ARE PLAN A STRATEGY THAT IS NOT ARTIFICIALLY PROPPED UP BUT THERE'S THEM WORKING TO MAKE US SAFER. THAT IS THE ONLY PATH FORWARD SET THE METRIC SET SPECIFIC STANDARDS IN DRIVE TO THOSE STANDARDS THIS DOES NOT DO THAT THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE THAT DIRECTS THAT ADDS THREE LAYERS OF BUREAUCRACY. ON TOP OF THE CPU. AND BY THE WAY I SHOULD ALSO SAY I AM THE ONLY INDIVIDUAL RESIDENT WHO IS A PARTY TO THE WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS BEFORE THE CPUC AND BY ALL MEANS THERE ARE ISSUES THERE. AND THAT IS NOT A PERFECT REGULATORY BODY BY ANY MEANS BUT THROWING ADDITIONAL LAYERS OF BUREAUCRACY ON TOP OF THAT ORGANIZATION AND THEN JUST. CALLING THAT A CURE IS NOT A SOLUTION WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS MADE FOR THEIR ALSO IN THIS LIMITED TO IGNITIONS HOW DID THAT GET IN THERE. DOROTHY SPREAD THE WILDFIRE AND IT CONTINUES ON THAT'S NO LONGER THEIR RESPONSIBILITY IT'S ONLY IGNITIONS THAT IS RIDICULOUS THERE IS A THIS IS A SLOW WALK AWAY FROM INVERSE CONDEMNATION WHICH AGAIN I SUPPORT. IF IT'S DONE WITH THOUGHT THIS IS A RUSH IN HASTE TO GET THIS DONE BY THE END OF THE WEEK AND IT'S TOO IMPORTANT FOR THAT. I'M MORE FOR ROLLING UP OUR SLEEVES AND I WANT TO SUPPORT THIS BUT I WOULD SUGGEST ROLLING UP OUR SLEEVES. SITTING DOWN GETTING ALL STAKEHOLDERS AT THE TABLE INCLUDING THE ONES THAT ARE FOR SAFETY. PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES PARK WHERE ARE THEY IN THIS. MUCH A GREAT ROLE AT ROAD ALLIANCE THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN THE SPACE FOR YEARS NO MORE REPRESENTED THIS BILL NOT CONSULTED ON THIS BILL. NOT SITTING IN THIS ROOM TODAY. THIS CANNOT GO THROUGH WITH THE OLDEST WITHOUT THOSE TYPES OF CONSUMER SAFETY MEASURES. IT'S THROUGHOUT THE BILL I COULD GO ON TO HAVE ANOTHER MINUTE WELL WE HAVE OTHER SPEAKER SIR IF YOU WANT TO WRAP UP YOUR COMMENTS BECAUSE WE HAVE QUITE A LINE. OKAY WAY I I I APOLOGIZE CLEARLY I'M VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS ISSUE I JUST ENCOURAGE FOLKS I WANT THIS TO GO THROUGH ALL WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS IN YOUR WHEN I REALLY AYE AYE. I I HOPE IT WORKS THEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN. HELPFUL TO SUGGEST WHAT PARTS OF THE BILL SPECIFICALLY THAT YOU HAVE. SPECIFIC AND THAT WE COULD WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THAT -- SIR GOOD AFTERNOON FIRST. I'M VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THE FACT THAT YOU ALL. ARE HAVING TO FACE THE THREAT. OF A DOWNGRADE PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME MY NAME IS MICHAEL J. GARY. I I BELIEVE THAT I'M THE ONLY PERSON IN THE ROOM THAT'S ACTUALLY TRIED. A WHILE FIRED PRUDENT SEE CASE BEFORE THE CPUC AND PREVAILED. BACK IN. EARLY TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND I CURRENTLY REPRESENT. A CALIFORNIA UTILITY CUSTOMERS IN THE WILD FIRE SUPREME COURT CASE IN WHICH WE FOUND A BRIEF. WHEN YOU HAVE TO RESPOND TO SOMEONE SAYING? THAT THEY'RE GOING TO LOWER. THE CREDIT RATING AND POSSIBLY DRIVE THE UTILITIES INTO BANKRUPTCY. AND SHUT OFF. THE ELECTRICITY. ASKING YOU A LOT. TWO TO ONE OF THINGS I WANT TO GIVE YOU COMFORT ON IS IF THE IF UTILITIES GOING TO BANKRUPTCY THEY CANNOT USE BANKRUPTCY UNDER BANKRUPTCY LAW. TO TURN OFF SERVICE ABSOLUTELY CARDINAL. PRINCIPLE OF LAW. ASSEMBLYMAN HOLDEN I I HAVE TO RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH YOU. WHEN YOU SAID YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR THREE YEARS? WHEN OUR OFFICE DISCOVERED THAT THERE WAS SYSTEMATIC FAILURE ON THE PART OF THE CPC TO ENFORCE FIRE SAFETY RULES? IT WAS NOT AN EXPANSION OF THE FIRE SAFETY STAFF WHICH WE URGED OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AFTER HAVING GONE THROUGH THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN FIRES. WE WENT TO ASSEMBLYMAN HOLDERS OFFICE. AND WE ASKED HIM LAST YEAR PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND REGIONALIZATION PLEASE COME BACK AND FOCUS ON FIRE SAFETY. AND WE WERE TOLD -- WILL DO BOTH AND WE DIDN'T DO BOTH WE WASTED ALL THAT TIME. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SPECIFIC PROVISIONS. WE NEED TO COMMIT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO STOPPING THE WILD FIRES CAUSED BY THE UTILITIES PERIOD. WE ABSOLUTELY MUST DO THAT AND WE CAN'T DO THAT BY STRICT ENFORCEMENT. STRICT ENFORCEMENT MEANS WE EXPAND THE ENFORCEMENT DIVISION. NOT CREATE A NEW ONE WE ALREADY HAVE A SAFETY ENFORCEMENT DIVISION IN THE CPUC. BUT WE NEED TO EXPAND IT. WE NEED TO STRENGTHEN THE REQUIREMENTS WE NEED TO CREATE SOME CRIMINAL PROVISIONS. RIGHT NOW ANYONE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT OPERATES AN INHERENTLY DANGEROUS MACHINE. SUCH AS THE AND THIS INDUSTRY. HAS STRICT LIABILITY NOT USED INVERSE CONDEMNATION BUT THEY HAVE STRICT LIABILITY WHY BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH POTENTIAL DAMAGE DONE. IF YOU DON'T DO IT THE RIGHT WAY. AND THE UTILITIES THEY ARE A AND TO THEIR CREDIT THEY ARE A RATE. GENERATION MACHINE. THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE SET UP FOR THEIR IS SET UP FOR LOBBYING THEIR SET UP FOR BILLING. THEY GO THROUGH ALL THE CPUC PROCEEDINGS THEY WORK THE SYSTEM WITH THE EX PARTE COMMUNICATIONS AND ALL THE REST OF IT. BUT WHAT THEY ARE NOT IS THEY ARE NOT SET UP TO FOCUS ON FOR FIGHTING SAFE ELECTRICITY SERVICE. LET'S BRING IN NEW MANAGEMENT FROM CAL FIRE. LET'S BRING FORMER CAL FIRE PEOPLE AND PUT THEM IN CHARGE. LET'S SITE PEOPLE FOR OF SYSTEMATIC VIOLATE STATE THIS SITE THE I. O. U.'S FOR SYSTEMATIC VIOLATIONS OF THE GENERAL ORDER NINETY FIVE SAFETY PROVISIONS. IF YOU DO THAT YES THERE'S GOING TO BE A DOWNGRADING. BUT I GET THE INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR ANALYSTS CALLING ME ALL THE TIME. AND I TELL THEM YOU MUST TELL THE UTILITIES TO CHANGE THEIR MANAGEMENT PRACTICES PERIOD YOU'VE GOT TO CHANGE AND IF YOU CAN CAN CALL COMBINED WITH THE RATE PAYERS. AND PUT PRESSURE ON THEM THEY'LL CHANGE THEY WILL CHANGE PLEASE. THIS IS A GREAT STATE YOU ALL HAVE AMAZING BACKGROUNDS TO GET HERE PLEASE STAND UP TO FOR YOUR STATE. PLEASE DO WHAT'S RIGHT AND SEND A MESSAGE TO THE MANAGEMENT OF THE UTILITIES YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BUILD THEM OUT BUT YOU'RE GOING TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. YOU WILL WORK WITH THEM I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD DO ANYTHING TO DRIVE PEOPLE INTO BANKRUPTCY AND THERE SHOULD BE. A GIVE AND TAKE IF WE'RE GONNA GET GREATER ENFORCEMENT YES THEN THEY'LL BE SOME MONEY BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO JUST GIVE IT AWAY RIGHT NOW. YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEEING MORE WILDFIRES WHY BECAUSE IF THERE'S ANOTHER WILDFIRE. THE RATES AUTOMATICALLY GO UP. IF THE RATES AUTOMATICALLY GO UP THEN THEY ROLLED INTO THE BONDS AND THE BONDS WILL FORD ALL THE WAY OUT YOU BE ISSUING BONDS ALL THE WAY UP TO TWENTY THIRTY FIVE AND THE UTILITIES WILL NOT CHANGE ONE IOTA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COURTESY AND YOUR ATTENTION THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS THANKS FOR BEING HERE. WE KNOW THAT YOU CAME FROM FAR. TO TESTIFY. I ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. DR JEAN NELSON WITH CALIFORNIA'S FOR GREEN NUCLEAR POWER INCORPORATED FOR AN INVENTOR BEFORE THE P. YOU SEE AND I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY ABOUT ONE ITEM LACK OF OVERSIGHT. AND HOW THAT WAS IDENTIFIED AS A KEY FACTOR BY THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD IN THEIR EVALUATION OF THE OF THE SAN BRUNO PIPELINE EXPLOSION. THEY SAID THE P. YOU SEE WAS A LACKS REGULATOR THIS IS WHAT REALLY NEEDS TO CHANGE HERE WE NEED MORE ENFORCEMENT NOT MORE COMMISSIONS NOT MORE MEETINGS IN SECRET WE NEED. MORE ENFORCEMENT GEO NINETY FIVE WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE EARLY NINETIES AND THAT'S THE WAY WE SHOULD BE GOING THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. OKAY -- WE'RE GONNA GO NOW TO OUR THE MISTER WEITZMAN. STEVE WEISSMAN -- THE AT THE REQUEST OF SOME MEMBERS -- IF YOU CAN -- LIMIT YOUR PRESENTATION FIVE MINUTES SIR IF YOU COULD. SO SAY THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS. IF YOU COULD PLEASE. WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE FOR THIS THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME. I THINK IT IS YEAH THAT IS SERVICE. SENATORS IT IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL IF WE COULD SIT HERE TODAY AND AND SAY WITH CONFIDENCE WHEN THAT NEXT. CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES WILL OCCUR THAT'S TRIGGERED BY UTILITY EQUIPMENT. WE CAN'T DO THAT BUT HERE'S WHAT WE DO KNOW. IF THE PATTERN THAT WAS ESTABLISHED OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS WERE TO CONTINUE. INTO THE FUTURE IF WE DO HAVE LIABILITIES OF THE MAGNITUDE THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST TWO YEARS CONTINUING GOING FORWARD. THEN WILL QUICKLY GET TO A POINT WHERE WE'RE AND OF COURSE THAT'S UNSUSTAINABLE FOR RATEPAYERS. AND IT'S UNSUSTAINABLE FOR SHAREHOLDERS OF THE UTILITIES AS WELL AND LET ME TRY [inaudible] TO FAIRLY BRIEFLY. EXPLAIN WHY SAYING THAT. I'VE HANDED OUT SOME SLIDES TO YOU TO KEEP THINGS MOVING IF YOU MOVE TO THE FOURTH SLIDE IT SHOWS US FROM RED IMPROVE OUR GRASS. THE THE BLUE -- BUYERS AND THIS GRAPH SHOW WITH THE A PATTERN OF RATE INCREASES -- FOR RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS. HAVE BEEN OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS. FOR A FOR P. JEANNIE TO USE THEM AS AN EXAMPLE THE THE THE CURRENT -- THE CURRENT AVERAGE BILL FOR RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS ACROSS ONE HUNDRED TWELVE DOLLARS. THE RED BARS HERE INDICATE. WHAT THE TYPE OF INCREASE IT TO THE AVERAGE BILL WE TEND TO SEE A YEAR IN YEAR OUT BASIS IF WE HAVE TO CONTINUE? TO HAVE THE UTILITY OF FLOOD MINDS. TO IN PAY BACK -- WILDFIRE ACOSTA OVER A FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEAR PERIOD AS YOU CAN SEE THE IN THE READ THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD. THAT WOULD BE ADDED TO THE BILL AS RESULT OF WILDFIRES WOULD BE WHICH IS ENTIRELY DWARF WHAT WE NORMALLY WOULD EXPECT IN TERMS OF RATE INCREASES. IF YOU LOOK AT THE FOLLOWING GRAPH. I'VE DONE SOMETHING WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT MORE REALISTIC WHICH IS. TO PILE THE RED BRED BUYERS ON TOP OF THE BLUE BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO SEE RATE INCREASES. FR THE USUAL REASONS THE UTILITIES HAVE TO RATE INCREASES IF WE ADD ON TOP OF THAT. THE THE AMOUNTS THAT COULD OCCUR WITH WELFARE LIABILITIES. YOU CAN SEE THAT WITHIN A IN THIS ILLUSTRATION SIX OR SEVEN YEARS YOU'VE ACTUALLY DOUBLE THE BILL -- FOR RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS. THE THE PROBLEM WITH WITH THIS. THE SCENARIOS IF YOU MOVE TO THE NEXT GRAPH IT IS THAT WE'RE ALREADY ON A COURSE TO FIRE X. FAR EXCEED. WHAT LOOKED LIKE THE NORMAL KIND OF RATING CURSES WOULD OCCUR OKAY I CAN A TRIP TO FOR A SECOND ABSOLUTELY -- HERTZBERG WANTS TO MAKE SOME -- CLAIRE FARMER MY I JUST EAT YOU WE THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE THIS THESE DOCUMENTS THAT YOU GAVE THAT ARE QUITE INSTRUCTIVE YES SHOWING THAT THE RATES OF THE BILL'S GOING UP BETWEEN A HUNDRED TWELVE DOLLARS TO TWO AND TWELVE DOLLARS THE NEXT PAGES SHOWING THE SAME NUMBERS. CAN YOU JUST EXPLAIN THAT FOR THE POPE THE THIRTY TWO MILLION PEOPLE ARE WATCHING THISAND THIS AUDIENCE TODAY AND FOR THE PEOPLE HERE. THANK YOU. YES IT IT. IF THIS IS A CLASS I USUALLY DON'T GET TO TALK TO BUT I WAS KIND OF HOPING IT WOULD BE THE USUAL PROJECTOR WHERE I COULD SHOW THIS TO EVERYBODY. BUT SO WHAT WHAT THAT WOULD HAVE DONE IN THIS VIRUS IS -- TO IS TO FIRST IS HAVE BEEN ACROSS THE BOARD FOR P. GINNY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THOSE ARE INDICATED. IN BLUE AND THE FIRST PARAGRAPH AND IN THE WHAT I'VE DONE IN RED IS TO SAY OKAY LE IF THE UTILITY WERE TO FACE A TEN TO FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLAR ADDITIONAL. LIABILITY DO A UTILITY TRIGGERED FIRE AN ANNUAL BASIS AND IF THESE CUTS WERE THE PASS THROUGH A TO THE RATE PAYERS THAT YOU WOULD SEE. APPROXIMATELY OF A A 10% INCREASE. IN THE RATES OF AN ANNUAL BASIS AND COURSE THOSE. THOSE CONTINUE TO COMPILE A TOP OF EACH OTHER I WOULD HAVE DONE THE SECOND SET A PROGRESS IS TO pWHEN I SHOWED IN BLUE YOU'D EXPECT THAT TO HAPPEN ANYWAY YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE? BUSINESS AS USUAL RATE INCREASES. BUT ON TOP OF THAT IF YOU HAVE THE WILD FIRE LIABILITIES YOU'RE GONNA HAVE AN EXTRAORDINARY IMPACT. AND AN OVERALL RATE SOMETHING TO FRANKLY WOULD NEVER STORE COOLEY SEEN IN PROPORTIONS LIKE THIS. NOW IS THE THE GRAPH TO FOLLOW SO WHICH IS SOMETHING IS CONTRIBUTED TO ME BY THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE AT THE PC -- SHOWS THAT WERE ALREADY ON A COURSE -- FOR INCREASES JUST WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR THAT COULD BE AS GREAT AS THE INCREASES ON AVERAGE SO WE SAW OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS. A BECAUSE SAID P. JEANNIE SO OF PENDING GENERATE CASE AND A REQUEST INCREASE ITS RETURN ON EQUITY BECAUSE OF THE ADDITIONAL RISK IT'S PERCEIVING DID AWHILE FIRES. A AND IN THIS SHOWS THAT -- IN IN YELLOW IF THE IF THE BOTH THOSE REQUESTS ARE GRANTED YOU COULD HAVE AN INCREASE. OF OF THE TWENTY THE TWENTY FOUR UP TO TWENTY FOUR CENTS PER KILOWATT HOUR ON AVERAGE FROM ABOUT TWENTY CENTS ON AVERAGE. JUST IN ONE YEAR [inaudible] IF THE IF THE A REQUEST FOR INCREASING RETRAIN EQUITIES NOT GRANTED THEN THE BLUE LINE -- WOULD APPLY BUT EITHER WAY. THESE RATE INCREASES IN ONE YEAR WOULD BE AS GREAT AS THE CUMULATIVE. AVERAGE RATE INCREASES THAT WE pDECADE SO WE'RE ALREADY ON COURSE. FOR DRAMATICALLY HIGHER UTILITY RATES IF YOU LOOK AT THE GRAPH TO FOLLOWS A SUPERIMPOSED A LINE ON TOP OF THE BAR GRAPHS TO SHOW YOU. THE WHAT THE TRENDS WOULD LOOK LIKE. CONSIDERING THE REQUESTED PGD IS MADE FOR RATE INCREASES THIS YEAR SO WE'RE WE'RE ON TRACK -- FOR FOR VERY DRAMATIC READING CREASES -- THEY'VE THE MUCH WORSE OF COURSE -- IF -- IF WE WERE TO GET TO A POINT. WHERE WE HAD TO COULD CONTINUE TO PASS ON? A CONSIDERABLE WILDFIRE LIABILITY SO WE CAN PASS IT IN THE FOR THE SAKE OF TIME. MANY OF THESE OTHER -- GRASS AND LET ME JUST GO BACK TOWARD THE BACK OF THE PACK. NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SECOND PROBLEM THE FIRST PROBLEM IS IT P. GENIES RATES ARE GOING TO GO UP ANYWAY. THE SECOND PROBLEM IS THAT UTILITIES ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO BORROW MONEY YEAR AFTER YEAR TO SPREAD OUT THE COST OF WILD. I THOUGHT IT SAID THERE AREN'T ANY NUMBERS ANTICIPATED JUST. SHOWS A PROBLEM NUMBER TWO AND WILL IMMEDIATELY MOVE TO THE NEXT NEXT SHEET. THE THE YES IF YOU MOVE TO THE NEXT PAGE AFTER THAT THE THE TABLE TO YOU SEE HERE IS PREVENT PROVIDED BY THE PC. IT SHOWS WHAT THE USUAL. RATIO IS BETWEEN AT THE UTILITIES. DEBT AND IT'S EQUITY THE AMOUNT OF MONEY IT GETS FROM SHAREHOLDERS FOR SYSTEMATIC MONEY. THAT IT BORROWS A IN THE THE USUAL RULE OF THUMB IS THE ONE TO SEE SOMETHING CLOSE TO PARITY BETWEEN THE RELIANCE AND THAT. AND THE RELIANCE ON EQUITY. PRIOR TO THE IF YOU HAD EXACT PARITY THEN YOU'D HAVE A RATIO OF ONE POINT NO. PETER YOU NEED FOR A FOR A IT STARTED MOVING TOWARD BANKRUPTCY WAS FAIRLY CLOSE TO THAT AHEAD OF A RACIAL POINT. NINE AND THEN DIALED A DRAMATIC AMOUNT OF MONEY TO PREPARE ITSELF TO GO INTO BANKRUPTCY. IN A RATIO WENT FROM POINT NINE UP TO ONE POINT. SEVEN THE HEALTHY RANGE YOU EXPECT TO SEE A RANGE SOMEWHERE IN THE POINT SIX TO ONE POINT OO A RANGE. AND SO IF THE UTILITIES HAVE TO DIRECTLY BORROW MONEY YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT IN ORDER TO PAY FOR WELFARE LIABILITIES THEN QUICKLY GET TO A POINT WHERE THEY WOULD APPEAR TO BE AN UNHEALTHY. TOO RISKY INVESTMENT AND THAT WOULD RAISE AGAIN THE COST OF OF OF BORROWING MONEY IT ALSO WOULD ATTEND. TO TWO BECAUSE INVESTORS AND INSURE STOCK. TO TO SHY AWAY FROM THE COMPANY SO -- SO THAT THAT'S WHERE WE WOULD BE IF WE JUST WOULD ALLOW. THE UTILITY SIXTEEN OF OUR MONEY A YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT IN THAT WAY THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS. THAT PEOPLE TALK IN TERMS OF SECURITAS SING OF THE MONEY THAT UTILITY HAVE TO BORROW A WHERE INSTANTLY YOU WOULD HAVE ACTUALLY A DEDICATED COMPONENT ON UTILITY RATE. THAT WOULD COVER THE COST FOR PARTICULAR ASSET OF BINDS. I AND THAT'S CONSIDERED TO BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD HELP UTILITY FROM ACTUALLY HAVING TO IMPACT ITS DEBT EQUITY RATIO OF FORD'S NORMAL BUSINESS HOWEVER EVEN THAT CANNOT BE INEXHAUSTIBLE. YOU CAN'T DO THAT YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT I CAN'T TELL YOU EXACTLY. WHEN YOU REACH THE TIPPING POINT? BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CANNOT BE SUSTAINED IN TERMS OF CONTINUING TO BORROWMONEY SO WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS OF ALL OF THIS. LOOKING AT THE SHEET WITH THE NUMBERS ONE THROUGH FVE WHICH IS -- FOR A THIRD FROM THE END. OF THE PATH. THE AND NOW IT IF IF THE RATES GO UP IS SIGNIFICANTLY AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. OF COURSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DO TWO THINGS ARE GOING. TO FIND WAYS TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF POWER THAT THEY'RE USING FROM THE UTILITIES. NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO AND THEY'RE GONNA TRY TO AVOID AND CHANGING TO THINGS SUCH AS ELECTRIC VEHICLES OR ELECTRIFYING A HOME -- THAT. WOULD OTHERWISE OCCUR BECAUSE THE THE RATIO OF GASOLINE PRICES TO ELECTRIC PRICES OR NATURAL% GAS ELECTRICITY IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AND FAVORABLE I'M SURE THAT COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE GOING TO HAVE LOTS OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU SURE. YOU CAN -- HANG AROUND YEAH ABSOLUTELY GARY IT'S POSSIBLE THAT. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE QUESTIONS FOR YOU SO IF YOU WANNA STICK AROUND AS WELL. THAT ASK YOU TO PROBABLY -- FOR THE MOMENT JUST STEP STEP ASIDE TO LET -- SUPPORTING STAFF COMMENDED PROVIDED FOR BY SUPPORT FOR THE MEMBERS PRESENTING BUT IF IF -- WE DO COME MAN I WANT ONE SEAT AT LEAST TO BE MET REMAIN VACANT SO. SO MEMBERS OF THE THE US OUT THAT HAVE PROVIDED -- TESTIMONY TODAY. CAN ANSWER QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. AND NOW WILL COME TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS THAT YOU WANT TO ASK HIM GO AHEAD ASK HIM -- ARE. YOU NEVER REFERENCE THE BILL SO ARE THESE GRAPHS. OUR REFLECTION OF WITH OR WITHOUT THE BILL THAT'S BEFORE US THIS IS A HEARING ON A PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION YOU NEVER REFERENCE STATE. ARE THESE GRAPHS RELEVANT REGARDLESS OF WE PASS OR DID THEY MODIFY IF WE PASS THIS BILL. THE EVENT TRY TO PURPOSELY STEER CLEAR OF A OF BEING HERE TO ENDORSE ARE NOT ENDORSE THE BILL ITSELF AND JUST PROVIDE BACKGROUND INFORMATION. MAN I ASK FOR YOUR EARLY BELT WHETHER THESE GRAPHS ARE IMPACTED ALL BY THE PASSAGE OF THIS BILL YES IF YOU LOOK AT LOOK AT THE GRAPH THAT. THAT -- START ON THE FOURTH PAGE THE THE IN READ SHOW THE POTENTIAL INCREASES COMING UP FROM REPEATED WILD FIRES -- THOSE. WOULD BE. THE SAME FOR A FOR RATE PAYERS -- WHETHER. THERE'S A THERE'S A SECURITIZATION -- IT'S THE BILL WOULD WOULD ALLOW FOR OR WHETHER THERE WAS A STRAIGHT EFFORT TO BORROW. BORROW MORE FUNDS A SO SO THE SO TO THIS EXTENT OF THE THE GRASS WITH WITH THE SAME. WITH OR WITHOUT THE BILL WHEN YOU START TO CONSIDER -- THE IMPACTS ON THE FINANCIAL STATUS OF THE UTILITY. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. THE BILL'S SECURITIZATION PROVISIONS WOULD PROBABLY BY THE UTILITY SOMETIME IN THE BE ABLE. TO TO CONTINUE TO BORROW MONEY FOR A WHILE BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE A GUARANTEED WAY TO PAY OFF THOSE PARTICULAR. METICULOUS -- OF BANDS BUT AGAIN IT'S NOT INEXHAUSTIBLE. OKAY A CENTER STERN. AMOS CHAIR I KNOW WE WANT TO MOVE ON TO THE BILL IN CHIEF I I JUST WANT TO GET THE SAME CLARITY I THINK THAT MY COLLEAGUE WAS SEEKING PROFESSOR SO. THE THE RED BARS. ON TOP OF THE BLUE YES. IS WHAT HAPPENS TO UTILITY BILLS. IF WE DON'T PASS ANY LEGISLATION THIS IS THAT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL SCENARIO WITH THOSE SORT OF PROJECTED LOSSES RIGHT. THAT READ THAT INCREASE THE THE IF IF THERE ARE DO NOTHING TODAY AND IF WE WANT OF THAT I WILL COMBINE INCREASE THAT IF IT IF WE WIND UP HAVING. WILD FIRES LIKE WE DID THE LAST TOUR ASSUMING WE HAVE THE SAME KINDS OF WILDFIRES IT HAD FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS. THE THE BIG JUMP IN UTILITY RATE INCREASES ARE FROM WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WITHOUT THIS LEGISLATION NO. WHAT WERE? YOU THERE OR IF IT'S REASONABLE. MY SENSE WAS THAT THIS IS A BUSINESS AS USUAL PROJECTION. THIS IS A BUSINESS AS USUAL PROJECTION YES YES OKAY SO REGARDLESS OF THE BILL THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN. NOT. IF IF WE WILL CONTINUE HAVE WILD FIRES IT IS THE RIGHT WE HAVE THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. AND IF THOSE COSTS ARE PASSED ON THE RATE PAYERS YES. BUT THAT BUT THAT STILL DOESN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION YOU SO I ASKED DID ORIGINALLY AND THEN HENRY ASKED FOR THE CLARIFICATION. DO THESE GRAPHS. ARE THEY MODIFIED AT ALL FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW IF WE PASS THIS BILL OR THESE GRAPHS GOING TO STAY THE SAME REGARDLESS. OF THIS BILL'S PASSAGE. MATT AMANDA SENTENCES REMINDING ME THAT THE BILL ACTUALLY. WOULD TEMPER THIS TO SOME EXTENT BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE FUND -- BUT IT HAS THE UTILITIES HAVE TO REPAY THE FUND THEY HAVE TO GET THAT MONEY FROM SOMEWHERE AND SO THAT. THE QUESTIONS ARE GOING TO BE HOW HOW THAT WILL ULTIMATELY. CONTRIBUTE TO RATE INCREASES SUCH LATER IF WE COULD MAYBE WITH WE ALLOW OUR TECHNICAL SUPPORT THE TO RESPOND I THINK IT WILL BE CLEAR THAT THESE. ARE COSTS ARE GOING TO HAVE THE KIND OF IMPACT IT'S BEING DESCRIBED. IF IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY AND DOCTOR WISEMAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG USUALLY THIS IS TO THE MIKE SORRY -- CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT THIS IS ILLUSTRATING WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF COST RECOVERY WERE ALLOWED ON DAY. ONE AND IF THE WILDFIRES CONTINUE AT THE CURRENT RATE SO IT'S ASSUMING COST RECOVERY -- YOU KNOW SIMILAR TO YOU BUT IT IT'S WE CONSUMING MEDIA COST RECOVERY THAT'S ASSUMING THAT THE RISK IN THE SIZE OF WILDFIRES CONTINUE. ON THOUGH THE MEASURE THERE WOULD BE NO COST RECOVERY ON DAY ONE THAT THE FUND WOULD PROVIDE UP TO FORTY BILLION DOLLARS OF CLAIMS CLAIMS PAYING RESOURCES -- THOSE RESOURCES OF THE TEN AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS A WILL COME WITH UTILITIES COULD NOT BE RECOVERED FROM -- REPAIR A FROM REPAIRS THE THE ADDITIONAL CAP ON THE PAY OUTS WOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CLAIMS BEING RESOURCES WITHOUT A DIME FROM RATEPAYERS. THE TEN AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS A COME FROM RAY PERSONS FROM CONTINUATION OF CHARGES THAT FOLKS ARE CURRENTLY PAYING. DURING THAT PERIOD THAT WOULD BE THE BENEFIT OF THE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS PLUS OF INVESTMENTS IN HARDENING THE INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL AS THE TIME FOR THE INVESTMENTS OF THE STATE IS MAKING RELATIVE TO REDUCING THE RISK AND FREQUENCY OF WILDFIRES. SO THAT THE NOTION HERE IS THERE'S FORTY MILLION DOLLARS OF OF CLAIMS PAYING RESOURCES TO PROVIDE THE BRIDGE FOR THE MITIGATION EFFORTS TO COME INTO EFFECT. TO MAKE IT SO THAT THESE RATE INCREASES THAT WOULD GO INTO EFFECT IF COSTS ARE BEING. PASSED ON IN WILDFIRES CONTINUE AT THAT RISK WOULD NOT OCCUR SO THIS IS THE STATUS QUO SCENARIO. UNDER THE MEASURE THAT WOULD BE THE FUN PROVIDING CLEAN FRAME RESOURCES. THERE WOULD BE THE INVESTMENTS IN MITIGATION AND ON HARDENING AND OTHER ELEMENTS TO REDUCE THE RISK -- TO TO ENSURE THAT THERE THERE ARE CLAIMS PAYING RESOURCES BUT WITHOUT THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON REPAIRS THAT WOULD HAPPEN UNDER CURRENT LAW. BUT JUST TO PUT A FINER POINT I APPRECIATE THE DETAIL. THIS IS A BUSINESS AS USUAL SCENARIO BEING PROJECTED. THAT WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY MITIGATED. UNDER YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THIS TEN FIFTY FOUR FRAMEWORK FOR THE RED. GETS CHOPPED DOWN AND THE ONLY QUESTION IS HOW MUCH DOES THE ACTUALLY GET CHOPPED DOWN IS THAT A FAIR. SUMMARY YES AND ALSO CAN INTO THE MODEL YEAH YOU CAN AND SORRY YES THAT THAT IS A FAIR SUMMARY AND THEN THE PIECES ALSO THAT HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE FOR THE MITIGATION TO AFFECTS OF THE RED DOES NOT HAPPEN AT ALL. RIGHT BECAUSE THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTION OF BUSINESS AS USUAL IS BASICALLY A DOOMSDAY SCENARIO OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES AFTER CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES TO CATASTROPHIC WHAT FOR THAT'S THAT'S THE BASIS OF YOUR ASSUMPTION CORRECT PROFESSOR YES OKAY. THANK YOU -- WE'RE GONNA SENATOR -- WE HAD -- WITH CENTER HERTZBERG AN OF MORE LIKE IT'S FIRST IN HERTZBERG [inaudible] RUBIO. THANK YOU MISTER WELCOME BACK. I'M. JUST TRYING TO KEEP THE SHOW BRIEF -- THAN A REVIEWING THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR P. JEANNIE -- THEY'VE ADDED SOME THIRTY FOUR BILLION IN LIABILITIES TO THEIR BALANCE SHEET. FOR THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN FIRES IN THEIR VICTIMS AND SO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW IS THAT PAID OFF -- THEY GENERATE ABOUT. SEVENTEEN BILLION A YEAR IN REVENUES AND ABOUT TWO BILLION A YEAR AND NET INCOME. WHICH HALF OF THAT GOES TO DIVIDEND SO THEY'RE JUST A LITTLE BIT OF PLAYING ROOM HERE -- WHEN YOU WHEN YOU HAVE A UTILITY YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE LIMITED ON WHAT YOU CAN CHARGE? SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT -- ONE YOU KNOW HOW HEY PAY OFF THE VICTIMS WHICH THEY COULD DO THROUGH A THIRTY YEAR. DAD I'M SURE AND THEN THAT WOULD COST THEM OF ABOUT ONE POINT TWO ONE POINT THREE BILLION A YEAR. GET A GOOD INTEREST RATE. TO PAY THEM OFF SO THAT DOESN'T LEAVE MUCH ROOM WITH NET INCOME TO HAVE CASH FOR OTHER THINGS I'M. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WOULD THEY PARTICIPATE IN THE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS. HOW WOULD THEY PARTICIPATE IN? MAKING CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE FUND. AND THEY HAVE TO BE NEUTRAL WITH TACT WITH RATE PAYERS AND THEY HAVE TO KEEP THEIR EMPLOYEES SO I'M. I'M SEEING ALL KINDS OF TOP WALL SO MAYBE I COULD ASK YOU THE SAME NUMBER HOLDEN HOW HOW IS. HOW IS UTILITY GOING? TO FULFILL WHAT WE'RE ASKING THEM TO DO WITH THIS BILL. WELL A RIB REMEMBER THAT P. JEANNIE CURRENTLY IS IN BANKRUPTCY AND SO THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH A PROCESS OF BEING ABLE TO GET. A PLAN IN PLACE THAT ALLOWS THEM TO MOVE FORWARD AND ULTIMATELY BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS FUND -- I THINK THAT THE EXPECTATION IS THAT. AS THE THE GENIE REPRESENTING MAYBE. IT YET AS A MEMBER HOLDEN I THINK -- NANCY -- AT THE MITCHELL CAN ANSWER HAT QUESTION -- AND MAYBE PROVIDE SOME INSIGHT IF THAT'S OKAY. SO I AM NANCY MITCHELL FROM A MOMENT IN MYERS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION. I'M WITH REGARD TO YOUR QUESTION -- CENTER MY LACKEY THE BANKRUPTCY PROCESS WILL RESULT IN SOME RE CAPITALIZATION OF P. JEANNIE. AND THAT WILL BE DONE THROUGH THE BANKRUPTCY PROCESS UNDER THE AUSPICES OF BANKRUPTCY COURT. I WOULD EXPECT THAT THAT MAY REQUIRE EITHER A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT BY THE SHAREHOLDERS TO SORT OF BY FUTURE. PROFITS OR A RE CAPITALIZATION OF THE COMPANY IN WHICH THE EXISTING DEBT MAY BE TURNED INTO EQUITY IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE ROOM THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT FOR THE INVESTMENTS. SO I THINK IF THERE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES IN THE BANKRUPTCY CONTEXT TO RECAPITALIZE IN A WAY THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO DO THAT. SO WE RE CAPITALIZE WE'RE GONNA DILUTED SHARES TO THE CURRENT SHAREHOLDERS AND WE'RE GOING TO CONVERT BONDS TO EQUITY COULD HAVE BEEN. THE WE ARE ARE WE ASKING BOND HOLDERS TO TAKE A HAIR CUT WELL THE BOND HOLDERS OF ALREADY MADE A PROPOSAL IN THE BANKRUPTCY ACTUALLY THAT WOULD ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. BUT I DON'T THINK YOUR BILL PUTS THE FINGER ON THAT PARTICULAR SCALE THERE ARE AT LEAST THREE WAYS TO EXIT BANKRUPTCY THE EXISTING EQUITY CAN PONY UP THE CASH. THE EXISTING DEBT CAN CONVERT TO EQUITY OR THE COMPANY COULD BE SOLD TO SOMEONE ELSE WHO WANTED TO PAY THE CLAIMS THAT THE STATUTE REQUIRES THEM TO PAY. IN ANY OF THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES THE COMPANY WOULD EXIT UNDER THE PARAMETERS THAT THE U. OF PUT IN THE STATUTE. SO. MISS MITCHELL I I SEE THE THE EFFICACY OF THE BILL BUT I SEE THAT IT TAKES CARE OF TODAY'S PROBLEMS AND I'M WONDERING. WHAT WE DO? WHEN THERE'S AN ENCORE? WHAT IT HOW DO WE HOW DO WE SQUEEZE BUT OUT OF A TURNIP BUT I'M? THAT'S WHERE I'M KIND OF SEARCHING FOR FOR REMEDY THE FROM THE BANKRUPTCY PROCESS THE JUDGE WILL HAVE TO DETERMINE THAT THE PLAN IS FEASIBLE THE FEDERAL JUDGE WILL HAVE TO DETERMINE THAT THE PLAN IS FEASIBLE. WHICH UNDER THE BANKRUPTCY CODE REQUIRES THE JUDGE TO MAKE A DETERMINATION THAT IT WILL NOT BE FOLLOWED BY A SUBSEQUENT REORGANIZATION. AND SO THEY WILL HAVE TO PUT A PLAN IN PLACE THAT PROVIDES ROOM FOR A FEASIBLE OPTION OF FOR FEASIBLE OPERATIONS GOING FORWARD IN ORDER TO EXIT THAT THE BANKRUPTCY PROCESS AND THAT'S JUST A REQUIREMENT OF ELEVEN TWENTY NINE OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE -- THE JUDGE WILL HAVE TO MAKE THAT FINDING ON A GOING FORWARD BASIS THEY WILL HAVE TO LIVE WITHIN THE THE PARAMETERS OF THE STATUTE. THE THE CHANGES TO THE STATUTE ALSO PROVIDE THEM SUPPORT IN TERMS OF THE USE OF THE FUND DOLLARS. TO CUT OFF THE RED LINE IS AS YOU GUYS WERE DISCUSSING EARLIER AND ASSUMING THAT THE MITIGATION EFFORTS TO DO TAKE HOLD. THEIR PLAN WILL BE BASED ON A HOLISTIC LOOK AT WHAT THEY NEED TO RECAPITALIZE GOING FORWARD AND THEY WILL HAVE TO MAKE THAT CASE TO THE BANKRUPTCY JUDGE. A BANKRUPTCY JUDGE WOULD. RESPECT A NEW BILL. LIKE THIS ONE OR IS THAT I DON'T REALLY THINK THE FEDERAL JUDGE HAS ANY CHOICE BUT YES I ALSO THINK THAT HE WILL IT IS A IT IS A REGULATORY CONSTRUCT IT IS PUT IN PLACE BY THE STATE -- HE IS. TO RESPECT STATE LAW WITH REGARD TO REGULATORY ISSUES. THANK YOU MSS MITCHELL THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU -- SIR SIR PLEASE DON'T INTERRUPT THE PROCEEDINGS PLEASE. CENTER HERTZBERG THANK YOU IF I CAN GET THE CABINET SECRETARY N AMAZON DOES. FOLLOW UP. HE COULD FOR A MOMENT. I CAN PUT A FINER POINT ON THE FINE POINTS A SINISTER INPUT ACCORDING TO THIS CHART. THAT THE PROFESSOR PROVIDED US FOR THE PUBLIC THE DOESN'T SEE IT. BASICALLY TEN YEARS OUT UNDER HIS -- STATUS QUO SCENARIO THAT WE DO A DO NOTHING STRATEGY. THE BILLS FOR P. JEANNIE I WOULD AVERAGE GO FROM AN AVERAGE OF A HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO DOLLARS A MONTH TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TWO DOLLARS A MONTH -- IT WOULD BE THE INCREASE OF A HUNDRED AND TEN DOLLARS A MONTH ON AVERAGE BILLS BASED UPON THE DO NOTHING SCENARIO. THE SCENARIOS OUTLINED IN A IN A BE. TEN FIFTY FOUR AS YOU CORRECTLY NOTED I JUST WANNA MAKES MORE SPECIFICITY ON IT -- REQUIRES BEFORE ANY OF THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES HAVE ACCESS TO THIS INSURANCE FUNDED THEY HAVE TO INVEST FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AND SO AS A CONSEQUENCE THERE'S GOOD ADDITION TO ANYTHING THAT THE STATE ALREADY DOES. THIS BILL REQUIRES FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN HARDENING BY THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES SO THAT THE POTENTIAL RISK OF FIRE WHICH IS PRESUPPOSED IN THIS CHART. GOES IS RUDE IS MEDICAID IS THAT CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT AND SECONDLY THE OTHER THING THAT IT DOES IS BY CREATING THIS THIS FONDA -- IT IT IN INSTEAD OF HAVING INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES UNDER THE CURRENT STRUCTURE OF OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION CREATES A FUND HALF WHICH IS CONTRIBUTED PRESUMABLY BY VIRTUE OF OF THE QUESTION THAT WAS JUST ANSWERED OF OF SICK. OF ADDITIONAL EQUITY PROVIDED BY THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES HALF BY THIS BY THE SHAREHOLDERS. OR OR INVESTORS IN HALF BY RATE PAYERS. OF AND THAT THEN FURTHER REDUCES ANY POTENTIAL RISK OF INCREASE BECAUSE OUR ON THAT WILL BE TAKEN UP BY BY THE FUND CORRECT RIGHT AND FURTHER. THE UNDER THE FRONT MODEL THAT YOU STRUCTURED IN A BE UP IN. THE IN THE MEASURE WAS A FIFTY FOUR EIGHT TEN FIFTY FOUR WHAT HAPPENS IS THERE'S A HAIR CUT ON THE FRONT END SUBROGATION SO THAT FURTHER TAKES A SMALLER AMOUNT OF MONEY TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE LARGER. RISK LIVE PROTECTION FOR RISK LIABILITY IN THE FUND IS THAT CORRECT ALSO THAT'S GREAT SO YOU REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE RISKY REDUCE THE SIZE OF OF FIRE RISK. YOU'VE CREATED OF A FIREWALL SO TO SPEAK TO PROTECT RATE PAYERS AND THE LAST THING I WANT TO MAKE IN TERMS OF THE MOST RECENT AMENDMENTS I BELIEVE THAT OCCURRED WITH RESPECT TO THIS MEASURE. IS THAT YOU HAVE PRIORITIZED SHAREHOLDER MONEY SO THAT IN THE EVENT THAT THERE IS A HORRIBLE FIRE THE FIRST MONEY THAT GOES OUT OF THAT INSURANCE FUND IS NOT RATE PAYER MONEY BUT A SHAREHOLDER MONEY CORRECT. THAT'S CORRECT AND THE TWO DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS ON AVERAGE THAT WILL BE CONTINUED FROM TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY FIFTY IS ACTUALLY PAID OUT UNTIL. AND BONDS ACTUALLY ISSUED UNTIL THERE'S ACTUALLY DEMAND FOR THE MONEY. OF THE BONDS GET ISSUE TO CAPITALIZE THE FUND THE THE THE FRONT AND IS GENERALLY THE EXPECTATION BUT AS YOU MENTIONED THE FUNDS WOULD BE ADMINISTERED IN A WAY TO HAVE THE RATE PAYERS I'M SORRY THE SHAREHOLDER DOLLARS -- BE PAYING FOR CLAIMS FIRST WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET TO IS THE POINT THAT SENATOR STERN WAS MAKING JUST ADD A FINER POINT TWO IS FINER POINT. IS THAT THERE IS A DRAMATIC DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT THE STATUS QUO WOULD BE IN THE EVENT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE FIRES AND WE CAN DID NOTHING. VERSES WHAT WE'RE DOING AS A RESULT OF THIS MEASURE ABSOLUTELY INCLUDING ALSO THE FACT THAT THE MEASURE WOULD PROHIBIT -- UTILITIES FROM BEING ABLE TO EARN A PROFIT. IN THE IN WHEN THE ANCHOR THAT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN COST TO PAY FOR HARDENING AND OTHER ELEMENTS AND THE VALUE OF THAT ALONE IS TWO AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS IN FOR GONE PROFITS. WHICH IS A SAVINGS TO REPAIRS BERRYHILL -- BY CENTER MCGUIRE. THANK YOU CHAIR IN THE CALIFORNIA. NO I HAVE NEVER. REVIEWED [inaudible] THANK YOU. WELL FIRST OF ALL OUT THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR BEING HERE BUT I DON'T WANT TO DISMISS IN ELSE. THE FOLKS THAT CAME FROM THE TUBS FIRE IN THE CAMPFIRE I'M SURE THAT WE SEE IT A LITTLE DIFFERENTLYTHIS IS PERSONAL TO THEM SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR COMING HERE AND EXPRESSING YOUR PERSONAL STORIES I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT. TO TO HEAR THE HUMAN ELEMENT I KNOW WE MAKE POLICY AND SOMETIMES YOU DON'T GET TO HEAR THE STORIES BUT I I'M REALLY ENCOURAGED BY THIS BILL FOR FOR THREE REASONS ARE IT DOES FOCUS ON THREE IMPORTANT. PART ORTIZ OF MINE WHICH WAS RARE I'M SORRY OPERATE CARE PROTECTION CORPORATE ACCOUNTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND ALSO THE NEW BOARD THAT WAS CREATED. BUT I DID HEAR THE GENTLEMAN PREVIOUSLY STATE THAT THERE IS NO ACCOUNTABILITY HE DOESN'T BELIEVE IN THE MATT METRIC. CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN TO ME THAT PORTION SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE ACCOUNTABILITY PIECE. SURE -- THE THE BOARD IS GOING TO WORK AND HOW WE'RE GONNA FOR A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT ELEMENTS THE FIRST PIECE IS. IS THE ADDITIONAL -- YOU KNOW THE REQUIRED SPENDING IN THE REQUIRE SPENDING WITHOUT A RATE OF RETURN THERE'S ALSO THE CREATION OF AN ADVISORY BOARD. THAT. THAT WOULD BE COMPRISED OF NATIONAL INTERNATIONAL EXPERTS ON THE ISSUE OF ELECTRICITY SAFETY. AND THERE ARE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT COMPONENTS THAT GET -- ADDED ON THERE'S A THE ANNUAL CERTIFICATION. OF SAFETY THERE WOULD BE PROGRESS REPORTS IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS THERE WOULD BE -- THERE BE FIELD AUDITS -- THERE'S ABOUT FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR THE P. YOU SEE IN THE COMPANION MEASURE AND SB ONE ELEVEN OR AB ONE ELEVEN FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR THE PC. AND THEN AS A IS THE AUTHOR OF MENTION THAT WOULD BE THE CREE IN ADDITION -- TO STANDING UP FROM THE WILDFIRE -- SAFETY DIVISION WITHIN THE PC THAT WOULD BE TRANSITION WITHIN A COUPLE OF YEARS TO A STAND ALONE DEPARTMENT WITHIN THE RESOURCES AGENCY THAT WOULD BE. EXCLUSIVELY FOCUS ON THIS AND WOULD BE TAKING ON THE FUNCTIONS OF THE FIELD AUDITS AND THE IN A WAY WHICH I THINK OF IT IS IT'S A VERIFY PLUS VERIFY PLEASE VERIFY -- THERE'S THE ANNUAL REQUIREMENT THERE'S THE PROGRESS REPORTS THERE'S A FIELD AUDIT ELEMENTS AND THEN THERE'S A STRONG FINANCIAL -- INCENTIVES FOR UTILITIES -- TO TO INSURE THEIR COMPLAIN BECAUSE IN ADDITION IN -- IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE FUND IN ORDER TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE PUTTING MANAGER STANDARD THE UTILITY MUST HAVE THE VALID CERTIFICATE OF SAFETY -- AND THE IF IF THE UTILITY IS NOT -- DOING WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO IT HAS TO REIMBURSE THE FUNDS IN SOME CASES UP TO A 100% WHEN THERE'S A UTILITY COSTS WHILE FIRE -- SO THERE ARE STRONG FINANCIAL INCENTIVES IN ADDITION TO THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS THAT STRENGTHEN THE EXISTING FRAMEWORK AND ENSURE THAT OUR ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTION IS GOING TO BE SAFER THAN IT IS TODAY. THANK YOU AND THEN THROUGH THE CHAIR I ALSO JUST WANT TO SAY -- YOU KNOW I TO OBVIOUSLY HAVE WELL. WHEN WHEN WE WERE WORKING ON LEGISLATION IN THIS AREA OVER THE LAST WHATEVER YEAR? YOU KNOW MY CONCERN WAS VICTIMS AS WELL AND SO I REALLY AM APPRECIATIVE OF THE VICTIMS THAT CAME OUT HERE TODAY AND I THINK I DO ACTUALLY THE EVEN THE VICTIMS IN OPPOSITION I DO SUPPORT ACTUALLY WHAT THEY'RE IT THEY WERE SAYING ABOUT CONCERNED ABOUT THE P. YOU SEE. IN THIS BEING HOUSED UNDER THE PC AND THAT THERE ARE FIRE EXPERTS I KNOW ONE OF THE OPPOSITION MENTION CAL FIRE AND I THINK OUR GOALS WITH THIS BILL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT ONE THAT WE WERE TIMELY SO THAT WE STARTED. TO THIS SORT OF SAFETY IMMEDIATELY WHICH IS WHY IT IS UNDER THE P. YOU SEE FOR NOW BUT THAT WE ARE BRINGING IN FIRE EXPERTS THAT WILL BE ON THE BOARD. THAT WILL BE MOVED OUT BY JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO THIS WILL NOT MEAN HE'S MAINTAINED UNDER THE CPC. AND IT WILL BE -- IT WILL BE OVERSEEN BY INTERNATIONAL EXPERTS ON FIRE SAFETY AND I THINK THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT NOTE. FOR THOSE WHO DID UP OPPOSE THE BILL THAT THEY ARE CLEAR ABOUT THAT. IF I COULD JUST VERY QUICKLY ON THE ACCOUNTABILITY. THERE ARE WITH THE WELL FIRE THE KIND OF SHOPPER QUALIFIER COUNCIL WORKING WITH ADMINISTRATOR THEY WILL DO AN ANNUAL REPORT THERE WILL LOOK AT THE MANAGEMENT OF THE FUND. OF THAT REPORT WOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE LEGISLATURE AND HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE REVIEWED. BY THE LEGISLATURE SO THERE THERE'S THAT CONNECTION ALSO WITH THE SAFETY BOARD OFTHERE WOULD ALSO BE REPORTING BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE -- ON AN ANNUAL BASIS SO IT GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO EVALUATE. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PLANS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD SO THERE'S CONTINUES TO BE -- THIS LEGISLATURE TO OTHER TO THE AGENCIES AS THEY GO FOR TO IMPLEMENT THEIR RESPECTIVE AREAS OF OVERSIGHT WHETHER ON THE FINDER ON SAFETY MEASURES AND THE LEGISLATURE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY COULD. EVEN HAVE -- INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS AND OVERSIGHT HEARINGS TO ALLOW FOR THE COMMUNITY DOLLARS OF TRANSPARENCY THROUGH THIS BODY AS WELL. THANK YOU SO -- THOU PARTICULAR PIECE TO ME I WANTED TO BE VERY CLEAR BECAUSE WHEN WE HEAR THERE IS NO ACCOUNTABILITY THREE FOUR TIMES. MAKES IT AS IT'S A FACT SO WHAT I'M HEARING IT'S A COMPLETE NEW DIVISION AND THAT'S NEVER EXISTED THAT'S GONNA BE CREATED. AND AFTER TWO YEARS IT'S GOING TO MOVE TO A STAND ALONE COMMITTEE WHERE WE'RE GONNA HAVE CONTINUE AS WE ARE YOU KNOW AUDIT THEIR BEHAVIOR. THERE'S ANOTHER PIECE HERE THAT I KNOW THAT A LOT OF MEMBERS FELT VERY STRONGLY ABOUT AND SO I'M REALLY THANKFUL TO THE AUTHORS BECAUS I KNOW WE DON'T START HERE. AND CLEARLY THIS IS A A BILL IT'S NOT A PERFECT BILL BUT THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE NOW WHEN YOU DID TAKE A LOT OF OUR CONCERNS SERIOUSLY. AND I WANT JUST -- FOR MY PURPOSE CAN YOU CLARIFY THE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION BEING TIED TO PERFORMANCE CAN YOU GIVE US A LITTLE BIT OF THAT. WELL I CAN LET YOU KNOW THAT IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT. TO ALL OF US TO ENSURE THAT THERE WERE NO HEADLINES IT SAYS WILDFIRES RESPONSIBILITY TELAVI AND THEN A MONTH LATER COMPENSATION BONUSES FOR EXECUTIVES. AND SB NINE A ONE AND ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AS WELL AS WE WERE LOOKING AT ONE OF THE STANDARDS OF WHICH TO HOLD -- A REVIEW AND MAKING SURE THAT THE UTILITIES ARE -- COMPLYING -- WITH THEIR ABILITY TO THE DRAW FROM THE FUND THAT THEY HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE A COMPENSATION PLAN IN PLACE WE'VE SENSUALLY. THROUGH THIS PROCESS HAVE DRAWN ON LEGISLATION THAT WAS IN THE WORKS -- AND TO TAKE THOSE ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES AND TO INSERT THEM INTO THE BILL AND A CONCEPTUAL STANDPOINT BUT I THINK IT GAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE. DEATHS AND AND CLARITY IN TERMS OF HOW THAT WOULD PROCEED AND THE METHODOLOGY IN WHICH THAT WOULD WOULD OCCUR. THANK YOU -- CAN YOU ALSO POINT -- TO MAKING ARE HELPING THE VICTIMS FROM THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WILDFIRES AND ALL THAT THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF THAT HOW -- THEY NEED TO BE TAKING CARE OF AND AND AGAIN A LOT OF THIS IS CONVERSATIONS I'VE HAD BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD YOU KNOW FIRST OF ALL PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT. WE'VE BEEN HAVING DISCUSSIONS BACK AND FORTH AND AND YOU HAVE TAKEN A LOT OF THOSE -- SUGGESTIONS THAT FIFA MADE BUT YOU KNOW VICTIMS CONTINUE TO BE A BIG PART OF THIS DISCUSSION AND SO CAN. WE RE ITERATE HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE TAKING CARE OF THOSE FIRE VICTIMS. ONE OF THE CONDITIONS -- THE FOR P. JEANNIE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE INSURANCE FUND AND TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE PRINT MANAGER STAND IT WOULD REQUIRE THAT. THAT THEY HAVE A PLAN OF REORGANIZATION THAT HAS BEEN APPROVED BY BOTH THE COURT AND THE PC. OF THE PC WILL HAVE TO CERTIFY THAT THE PLAN PROVIDES. FOR IN IN FULL FOR THE VICTIMS IN THE MATTER THAT'S DETERMINED BY THE COURT AND TO DO THAT IN A WAY THAT S REPAIR NEUTRAL SO -- BAND IT'S AN INPUT AND IMPORTANTLY IT PROVIDES THAT A DEADLINE FOR ONE THAT HAS TO BE DONE BY -- SO BY NEXT SUMMER IT WILL BE WHEN THE PLAN WOULD BE -- WOULD HAVE TO GO INTO A FACTUAL AS I THINK ABOUT THE COMMENTS OF THE VICTIM OF THE OF THE SURVIVOR OF THE BUTTE FIRE OR WHO'S BEEN WAITING FOR YOU KNOW. ALMOST FOURTEEN HUNDRED DAYS -- THIS WOULD PROVIDE THAT THE PLAN OF REORGANIZATION HAS TO BE SIGNED OFF ON BY THE COURT IN THE CERTIFICATION BY THE PC BY NEXT SUMMER. IN THE INTEREST OF TRYING TO BRING FINALITY AND FAIR TREATMENT OF VICTIMS AS PART OF THAT -- CERTIFIED -- PLAN OF REORGANIZATION. THANK YOU SO SO I CAN -- A FOR ME I NEEDED. TO HEAR THAT WE DO YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THOSE VICTIMS THAT ARE CURRENTLY STRUGGLING TO TO BECOME WHOLE AGAIN WE HEARD THE STORY FROM THE THE LADY WHO LOST HER HOME AND SHE IS NOW HAVING TO WORK A JOB EVEN AFTER RETIRING AND HAVEN'T. PAID OFF HER HOME AND SO THAT'S IMPORTANT AND HAPPY PROTECTIONS MOVING FORWARD BECAUSE I THINK I ALSO HEARD -- YEAR HOW WE'RE TAKING CARE OFNOW NOT THE FUTURE BUT I FEEL THAT HAVING THAT STAND ALONE COMMITTEE. CON STAYED OUT MAKE DOING THEIR AUDIT TO MAKING SURE THAT SAFETY MEASURES ARE IN PLACE IT IS SETTING US UP FOR A BETTER FUTURE. AND SO YOU KNOW RATE PAYER NEW TRY JUST HEARD YOU SAY THAT WHICH IS IMPORTANT AND SAFETY CELLS SO I'M REALLY ENCOURAGED BY THE BILL AND AGAIN FOR ALL THE CONCERNS ARE OUT THERE IT'S NOT A PERFECT BILL AND NOT TO SAY WE'RE GONNA STOP WITH THIS AND AND WE'RE GONNA. CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO MAKE A BETTER AND TAKE ALL THOSE CONSIDEATIONS. INTO ACCOUNT BUT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING HIS FOR I THINK IT'S A IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DO SOMETHING NOT DOING ANYTHING IS NOT AN OPTION IN THIS CASE WELL I APPRECIATE YOU ANSWER MY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU TO EVERYONE ESPECIALLY THOSE THOSE VICTIMS WHO ARE HERE TODAY I THINK THAT BRINGS A SENSE OF REALITY TO ALL OF US AND WHY WE'RE HERE AND WHY WE'RE WORKING SO HARD ON THIS LEGISLATION TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT STRUGGLE AND SUFFERING AS I WALK. THROUGH THE COFFEE PARK WITH MY GOOD FRIEND -- FROM SANTA ROSA AND THEN -- WE WENT IN WALK THROUGH PARADISE YOU CAN'T SEE THAT WITHOUT LIVING IT IN SOME FORM AND KNOWING THAT WE HAVE TO PREVENT THAT AND MAKE SURE RESTITUTION IS. BROUGHT TO THOSE VICTIMS AS WELL AS FUTURE LIABILITY IS COVERED IN THIS AND AND I WANT TO ALSO HANK THE THE GOVERNOR'S DEATH -- AND THEIR RESPONSIVENESS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS WHEN I FIRST HEARD THE BILL -- I LIKED IT IN CONCEPT ALIKE WOULD LOOK LIKE IT SOUNDED LIKE AND THEN WE HAD THE THE LANGUAGE CAME OUT LOOKED AT THAT AND THEY WERE. YOU KNOW SOME ISSUES OBVIOUSLY THAT IT'S ALWAYS IN THE DETAILS. OF AND THOSE QUESTIONS THOSE CONCERNS EVERYONE OF THEM WAS -- WE RAISED AND WERE DRESSED IN THE CONVERSATIONS AND I I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH THERE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS I STILL HAVE. LINGERING AND ALSO THAT IN WHICH NOT IN THIS BILL BUT LOOKING FORWARD TO A SUCH A BE IN SB ONE ELEVEN WHEN WE CANNOT REMOVE SAFETY. FROM THE P. UC AND PUT IT INTO A STANDALONE OPERATION WHICH SHOULD BE I THINK MORE EFFECTIVE IN THE LONG RUN BUT QUESTION. UP IN THE THE SECTION. EIGHT OH FIVE TWO FOUR IN THAT THAT WOULD BE THE INTENT -- IN THE WATER CODE WHICH IS THE REVENUE REQUIREMENT SHALL REMAIN IN EFFECT UNTIL JANUARY OF OF TWENTY THIRTY SIX I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE. THAT THAT WILL EXPIRE AT THAT TIME IN THAT THERE'S NO INTEND TO CONTINUE THAT IN ANY FORM. SEC COULD YOU JUST SEND I DIDN'T HEAR WHICH PART TWO OF THAT MY AND A SECTION THAT WAS THE WITH THE WATER BECAUSE THE EIGHT OH FIVE EIGHT OH FIVE TWO FOR THE SECTION. RELATED TO THE EXTENSION OF THE FEE AND FOR HOW LONG THAT WILL GO FOR I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S CLARITY THAT IT WILL BE EXTENDED. SO THE EXTRA YES THE EXTENSION WOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE TIME PERIOD TO FINANCE A TEN AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS OF CONTRIBUTION FROM REPAIRS TO THE FUND AND IT WOULD EXPIRE THE SET TIME. THANK YOU. AND IN THE OTHER PART THAT I THAT I WAS CONCERNED WITH IN THAT IT'S THE SECTION -- THIRTY TWO EIGHTY TWO WHICH PROTECTS THE IN THIS GOES TO CRIMINAL. AND CIVIL LIABILITY AND THIS IS WHERE TALKS ABOUT THAT THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE OF THE FUND THAT THAT'S BEING CREATED -- WOULD BE -- KIND OF WOULD BE FREE FROM LIABILITY AND EXAM FROM ANY LIABILITY FOR CIVIL AND AND CRIMINAL -- ANY ISSUES THAT COULD ARISE AND AND I GUESS MY CONCERN IS IN. I BELIEVE THE UNDERSTANDING NOW IS IT THAT ONLY APPLIES TO STATE. EMPLOYEES ARE STATE ACTIONS STATE IF POINT IS FOR THE FOR THIS RIGHT NOT THE BANK'S NOT THE THE THOSE WHO WOULD BE LANDING THE INVESTMENT FIRMS IT WOULD BE LANDING IN LEARNING THE MONEY TO IT. EXACTLY CENTER THIS MERS A SECTION THAT APPLIES TO THE EXISTING PROGRAM ALL OF THE CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY SO THE MAYOR'S THAT SECTION FOR PURPOSES OF THE FUND ADMINISTRATOR IS EXCLUSIVELY FOR THE STATE EMPLOYEES. IT IS ALL ON RELATED AND DOES NOT AFFECT ANYTHING RELATED TO THE ISSUANCE OF THE BONDS OR TO ANYTHING ELSE THAT WOULD BE BY BANKS IT'S JUST. THE CURRENT LAW THAT APPLIES TO CA JUST BE MAKING IT CLEAR THAT PROTECTION FOR STATE EMPLOYEES EXTENDS TO THE STATE THE ROLE OF STATE EMPLOYEES IN THE CONTEXT OF A BEING A MINISTER'S ON THE FUND WE THANK YOU -- AND THEN. THE ONE CHANGE IN THE IN THE KIND OF THE LANGUAGE WAS THE THE CPUC DEFINING SERIOUS DOUBT AND AND I'D MINOR CHANGE THAT'S NOT A LEGAL STANDARD. AND HOW DOES THAT YOU DO YOU HAVE AN TEND OF WHAT IS MEANT BY SERIOUS DOUBT AND HOW WOULD THAT OF THAT APPLY THE SERIOUS DOUBT IS ESSENTIALLY THE THE LANGUAGE THAT IS INCLUDING THE FIRST DECISIONS AND IN THE FOR A STANDARD SO COMES FROM FOR DECISIONS. APPLYING IT TO STATE LAW IT IS -- IT IS -- THE LOWER YOU KNOW EVIDENTIARY STANDARD THAN SAY PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE SO IT'S LESS THAN 50% AND IT JUST MIRRORS THE FOR A STANDARD TO SAY THAT IF THERE IS SERIOUS DOUBT. THE BURDEN TO PROVE PRUDENT SEE WOULD SWITCH BACK TO THE UTILITIES OKAY. THAT AND THAT'S AS WHAT I WAS HOPING IT WOULD BE WHICH I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THAT WAS THAT. THE DEFINITION AND ANOTHER WOULD JUST THE PRUDENT SEE STANDARD. IS THAT THE SAME IN THE LIQUIDITY FUND -- AS IS IT THE SAME STANDARD THROUGH BOTH FUND IT IS NOT SO IN THE CONTEXT OF THE YOU TO OF THE LIQUIDITY FUND IF THE YOUTH IF THE IF. THE TWO UTILITIES OPT FOR THE LIQUIDITY FUND. THE THE THE STANDARD FOR PUTTING MANAGER WOULD ACTUALLY RETURNED BACK TO THE PRE SB NINE OH ONE STANDARD SO IT WOULD BE THE OLD STANDARD THAT WAS IN EFFECT WHEN THE DENTIST AND DECISION WAS ISSUED RELATIVE TO COST RECOVERY. THAT'S THE PRETTY SEE STANDARD THAT GOES ALONG WITH THE LIQUIDITY FUND THE THE STANDARD THAT IS BASED ON THE PHONE THE FIRST STANDARD BUT INCLUDES ADDITIONAL IMPORTANT CONSUMER PROTECTION SUCH AS THE ANNUAL SAFETY CERTIFICATION. THAT IS ONLY AVAILABLE IF WE ARE IN THE INSURANCE FUND COSTA CONSTRUCT OKAY THAT THAT THAT CLARIFIES THAT IDENTIFIED COULD MAKE A STATEMENT BECAUSE I IT THE END HERE MISTER CHAIR THAT. SO I WON'T HAVE TO TAKE MORE TIME LATER I YOU KNOW AS I WAS LOOKING AT THIS AND AND THE ISSUE I THINK ALL OF US FOR THE LAST YEAR BEEN TRYING TO COME TO SOME. IN OUR MIND HOW ARE WE GOING TO SOLVE THIS AND WHAT WHAT IS THE THE ISSUE THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR AND AND ONE IS THE ISSUE OF FUTURE LIABILITY. WE'RE TEMPTED TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM AND THEN PROBABLY MORE IMPORTANTLY TO TO LOOK AT THIS THROUGH A REPAIR LANDS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RATE PAYERS ARE PROTECTED THROUGHOUT AND THE IN THAT'S BEEN TAKEN MY GUIDING PHILOSOPHY THROUGHOUT -- HAS BEEN YOU KNOW UTILITY MANAGEMENT IF THEY MADE POOR DECISIONS ARE IF WE SEEN IN THE PAST AND THERE INACTION. OR THEIR DIVERSION OF OF MAINTENANCE OR DIVERSION OF FUNDS THAT THEY'VE DONE LED TO A FIRE THAN. IN THOSE MANAGERS AND SHAREHOLDERS I THINK SHOULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE CLEARLY AND THEY SHOULD PAY. BUT IF THEY DID EVERYTHING CORRECTLY THEY DID EVERYTHING ACCORDING TO WHATEVER PLAN IS DEVELOPED AND MONITORED AND AUDITED AND INSPECTED -- AS IT GOES FORWARD -- IN THINGS HAPPENED. THAT CAUSED THAT. DESTRUCTION WILD FIRES A DIVING BECAUSE WE ALL BENEFIT FROM THE UTILITIES BENEFIT FROM THOSE WIRES THAT -- THAT ARE TRAVELING THROUGH OUR STATE THAN THE THAT WE SHOULD COLLECTIVELY SHOULDER THOSE COSTS AND AND TO SHARE THAT THAT THAT SEEMS FAIR TO ME -- AND I THINK THIS BILL YOU KNOW A. B. TEN OR TEN FIFTY FOUR AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS. FOR WORKING HARD WITH THIS AND AND COMING TOGETHER ON A SOLUTION I THINK DOES THAT AND IT DOES IT IN A IN A VERY FAIR WAY IT -- TO IT BRINGS US TO A POINT WHERE THE INSURANCE FUND WILL PROTECT THE FUTURES WITH THE LIMITATION. OF THAT TEN POINT FIVE BILLION AS THE TOTAL COSTS. TO RATEPAYERS. AND WHEN YOU COMPARE THAT TO THE COST TO THE FIFTY FORTY FIFTY SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS THAT SHAREHOLDERS COULD BE RESPONSIBLE FROM THE I. O. U.'S GOING FORWARD. AND THE THE THE THE THE PART OF THE BILL THAT I THINK WAS REYES THAT THOSE SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN WILDFIRE. WILL BE COVERED THROUGH THE P. JEANNIE BANKRUPTCY IF THEY WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS FUND -- AS A LEAVE BANKRUPTCY THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE THOSE VICTIMS HOLE NOT. THE RATE PAYERS DOING SO I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF OF WHERE WE ARE AND THE DIFFICULT TASK OF GETTING THERE AND I'LL BE PUTTING I THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I TAKE A MOMENT ALSO TO SAY THANK YOU. TO INDIVIDUALS UP ON THE STYLIST CARE CENTER HERTZBERG IN SOONER. DODD FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS WAS A THANK YOU TO THREE SUMMERS WHO ARE SIT IN FRONT OF US TODAY HOLDEN MAYES THANK YOU SO MUCH. OF COURSE MADAM CHAIR BREAK GRATEFUL FOR EVERYTHING YOU ALWAYS DO AND ALSO WANTED KNOWLEDGE THE HARD WORK. BY THE ADMINISTRATION ON MONSANTO'S TO LIVE IN THIS OP FOR THE PAST. SEVERAL MONTHS. I THINK THAT WE CAN ALL COME TO TODAY SAYING THAT WE HAD CHALLENGES. OUT WITH THIS BILL. I AND ESPECIALLY WITH THE EARLIER VERSION OF THE BILL AND OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS THERE'S BEEN. A LOT OF FOCUS ON HOW TO BE OR TO BRING POSITIVE CHANGES TO THE BILL BY THE TEAM. THAT WAS JUST MENTION A AND BY MANY OTHERS. AND WHEN THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF UTILITIES TODAY. I THINK OUR FIRST PRIORITY NEEDS TO BE TALKING ABOUT THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF CALIFORNIANS. WHO LOST THEIR HOMES? A NEW CONTINUE TO REBUILD THEIR LIVES. AND UNFORTUNATELY ON THE NORTH COAST WE SEEN. TOO MUCH FIRE WE SEEN TOO MUCH FIRE FOR THE PAST. FOR FIVE YEARS. I AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS PROPOSAL INSURERS THAT SURVIVORS. OF THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WILDFIRE SIR. PAID WITH THEIR DO -- WITH FULL CONTRIBUTIONS. P. GINNY WILL PAY OUT BETWEEN TWENTY THREE AND FORTY FOUR BILLION. AND THAT'S DEPENDENT. ON THE SETTLEMENT IN FEDERAL COURT BUT WOULD BE ABOUT TWENTY THREE TO FORTY FOUR BILLION. IN TOTAL WE TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS IN FRONT OF US TODAY IT'S ABOUT THIRTY TO FIFTY BILLION FROM [inaudible] ALL UTILITIES. THIRTY TO FIFTY BILLION. WITH NO RATE INCREASES THE CALIFORNIANS. P. GENIES GONNA FORGO ONE POINT SIX BILLION IN FIFTY REQUIREMENT RATE INCREASES THAT WERE. IN THE PIPELINE. ON A AND E'S SENATOR HILL JUST MENTIONED -- IF THAT INSURANCE FUND IS ULTIMATELY UTILIZE. SHAREHOLDER FUNDS. MUST BE USE FIRST. NOT RATE PAYERS. AND THAT IS CRITICAL TO THIS DEAL. THAT SHAREHOLDERS ARE PAYING FIRST. NOT RATE PAYERS. IN THE ONLY WAY THAT A UTILITY SUCH AS P. JEANNIE WOULD BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE FUNDS WITHIN THE INSURANCE FUND. IS IF THEY PAY. SURVIVORS WHAT THEY'RE DO. AND I KNOW THAT THERE MAY BE SOME DISAGREEMENT IN THIS ROOM -- AT THE SAME TIME THOUGH. THERE IS BEEN. KNOW WHETHER DEAL IN FRONT OF THIS LEGISLATURE. I WOULD ENSURE FIRE SURVIVORS WOULD BE PAID OUT. PRIOR TO UTILITY ACCESSING ADDITIONAL FUNDS. I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE OF TRUST. AND JUST BEING HONEST ABOUT IT THERE IS AN ISSUE OF TRUST WITH P. JEANNIE AND ALL TO SPEAK FOR MYSELF. AND THAT IS WHY -- I APPRECIATE THE FOCUS ON EXECUTIVE PAY. THIS BILL WHILE IT IS NOT PERFECT MAKES SIGNIFICANT STRIDES TO HOLD. P. JEANNIE TILLY'S ACCOUNTABLE AND I TO GO THROUGH THREE POINTS NUMBER. ONE IN INEXTRICABLE STRICT LIMITS ON CASH COMPENSATION. WITH PAY LINKED TO PERFORMANCE METRICS AND NO GUARANTEE THOSE. IT WAS A GREGIS. THAT PEOPLE JUST LOST THEIR HOMES IN EXECUTIVES. THOUSANDS OF EXECUTIVES WERE. ABOUT TO SEE THEIR PAY GO UP. THIS BILL WILL PUT A LIMIT ON THAT. TO A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF COMPENSATION AND BE TIED TO LONG TERM PERFORMANCE AND VALUE. THREE THERE'D BE INCENTIVES TIED TO COMPENSATION TO SAFETY. INCLUDING TIME 1100% OF INCENTIVE COMPENSATION TO SAFETY PERFORMANCE AND DENYING ALL INCENTIVE COMPENSATION IF UTILITY CAUSES A CATASTROPHIC WHILE FIRE. WHICH RESULT IN ONE OR MORE FATALITIES. THE OTHER CHANGE THIS BILL IS SEEN OVER THE PAST. TEN DAYS IS THE BURDEN OF PROOF STANDARD IT'S FLIPPED. THE BURDEN OF PROOF STANDARD HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY AMENDED FROM WHAT WAS FIRST INCLUDED WITHIN IT AB. TEN FIFTY FOUR IT ENSURES UTILITIES HAVE THE ULTIMATE BURDEN TO SHOW THAT THEY WERE PRUDENT IF. JUST OUT TO RAISE ABOUT THEIR CONTACT SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT. IF AN INDIVIDUAL OR ADVOCACY GROUPS GO IN FRONT OF THE PC. BOTTOM LINE IN THIS AND THEY ARE ABLE. TO SHOW THE P. YOU SEE. THAT THERE IS PROOF THAT THE UTILITY COSTS A WILDFIRE OR ADVANCE SERIES DOUBTS THREE MEMBERS OF THE PC SIDES WITH THOSE RATE PAYERS ADVOCATES. AND THAT. MEANS THAT THERE. WOULD BE ENHANCE INVESTIGATION AND THAT. I UTILITIES WOULD BE HOLD ACCOUNTABLE. BACK TO TALK ABOUT SAFETY CERTIFICATION. THE REASON WHY I THINK THE STANDALONE DEPARTMENT. IS IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE WE NEED A DEPARTMENT IT IS SOLELY FOCUSED ON THE SAFETY OF OUR ELECTRICITY INFRASTRUCTURE. THE GENTLEMAN TO MY LEFT SENATOR HILL HAS DONE YEOMAN'S WORK ON ALL ISSUES ON THE GAS SIDE I THINK THIS IS. ALSO CRITICAL TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS IN TWO IMPORTANT WAYS. NUMBER. ONE IT'S GOING TO PROVIDE BOTH OVERSIGHT. FOR INVESTOR OWNED AND PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES AND IT'S ACTUALLY CAN HAVE A CLEAR MISSION A CLEAR MISSION TO FOCUS ON SAFETY STANDARDS WHEN IT COMES TO LINES. THROUGHOUT THE STATE IT WILL ALSO BE MORE NIMBLE IN THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND. TO NEW CHALLENGES THAT UTILITIES MAY FACE WHEN IT COMES TO CUSTOMER SAFETY. FINALLY MISTER CHAIR ALL ENDED HERE AND I COULD TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE. THERE ARE SOME ISSUES THAT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT TODAY THAT NEED TO BE DISCUSSED IN THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE SENIOR INSURANCE NON RENEWED -- IN THOUSANDS THOUSANDS THIS OCTOBER WILL SEE THEIR RENTAL ASSISTANCE PRIOR. IN THIS LEGISLATURE NEEDS A COME BACK TOGETHER WITH AN AGREEMENT. WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO FOCUS ON THE ISSUE OF INSURANCE AND LIKE. TO ASK MISS MONSANTO OUT WHAT HER THOUGHTS ARE ON THAT IN ADDITION. I THINK THAT WE ALSO NEED TO HAVE A FOCUS ON A INVESTMENTS IN COMMUNITIES FOR HOME HARDENING. UP FOR GREAT HARDENING IN FIRE RESILIENCE AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT SENATOR STERN HAS BEEN. VERY FOCUSED ON SENATOR WIENER AS WELL -- AND I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE CRITICAL AS WE COME BACK AND I HAVE ONE LAST ITEM WOULD LIKE TO BE TO SEE MISS MONTHS ON TO ON BEHALF AN INSPIRATION YOUR THOUGHTS. ON ISSUES OF RESILIENCE HARDENING IN INSURANCE. THOSE CENTER -- YOU WE SEE THIS AS PART OF A PACKAGE OF BILLS ON IMPORTANT INVESTMENTS INCLUDING THE BUDGET IN THE AREA OF LITIGATION -- IN THE AREA OF ADDRESSING AND REDUCING THE FREQUENCY AND THE INTENSITY OF WILDFIRES. THE ISSUE OF INSURANCE WAS -- DEFINITELY FOCUS OF THE BOTH THE STRIKEFORCE REPORT AS WELL AS A NINE A ONE REPORT AND WE SEE THAT AS AN AREA THERE ARE MANY MANY ARE. GOOD -- MEASURES WORKING THROUGH THE PROCESS AND WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU ON THE ISSUES OF INSURANCE OF WORK WITH THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER AND THE BALANCE OF THE SESSION -- SIMILARLY WE SEE LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES IN THE AREA SUPPORTING COMMUNITY RESILIENCY -- WE SEE OPPORTUNITIES BOTH AS PART OF THIS MEASURE AND HOW THE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN THE WALL FOR MITIGATION PLAN -- GETS USED TO ENSURE THAT THE RESILIENCY EFFORT FROM THE UTILITY SIDE OF THE EQUATION IS FOCUSED ON OUR ALMOST WILL DOUBLE COMMUNITIES BUT ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON LEGISLATION THAT'S GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS AS WELL AS POTENTIAL INVESTMENTS NEXT YEAR. THAT ADDRESS -- THAT DID THE BUILD ON EXISTING EFFORTS TO ADDRESS -- THIS RISK IN -- TO MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES -- MORE READY TO REDUCE THE RISK AND FREQUENCY OF WILDFIRES. I APPRECIATE IT UNDER WINNER WE'RE GONNA GO TO CENTER WINNER NOT YET JUST ONE LAST ITEM -- THE TEACHER ABSOLUTELY. YES YEAH I APPRECIATE THAT AND I I THINK THAT THERE ARE GOING TO BE SEVERAL UP PROPOSALS THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS GONNA WANT TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON COME AUGUST. BUT TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE ON THAT AND MY LAST ITEM I MISTER CHAIR AND I WILL NOT GO IN DEPTH ON THIS ALL SPEND FIFTEEN SECONDS. WE HEARD MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SPEAK ABOUT THE POTTER VALLEY PROJECT -- WHICH GINNY HAD TO WALK AWAY FROM BECAUSE OF THE BANKRUPTCY WHICH SUPPLIES WATER TO SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND FOLKS IN THE NORTH AREA AND THAT IS A CRITICAL ISSUE THAT WILL NEED TO TACKLE. AT A FURTHER DATE AGAIN SENATOR DODD CENTER HERTZBERG HER HUESO AND THE WOMAN BURKE. IN THE REMAINS TO NUMBER HOLDING THANK YOU FOR YOUR HARD WORK -- IN ALL BE AT SUPPORT OF A DECISION TODAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- I WANT TO START BY JUST THANKING -- THE AUTHORS OF AND THE GOVERNOR -- FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER -- I FIND THE THE AUTHORS SITTING HERE AS WELL AS THE ONES IN THE THERE SIR ALL VERY -- A STRAIGHTFORWARD -- PEOPLE WHO I WORKED WITH EXTENSIVELY WHO WANT TO DO RIGHT BY THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND I KNOW THE GOVERNOR FOR TWENTY YEARS BACK TO WHEN HE WAS SUPERVISOR. A NEW SOME -- AND I KNOW THAT -- HE IS ALSO ONLY INTERESTED IN MAKING THINGS BETTER FOR THE RATE PAYERS AND THE VICTIMS -- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND SO THANK YOU FOR THE INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT'S GONE INTO THIS. I'M THERE'S THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD IN THIS BILL AND IN TERMS OF THE THE HEART OF THE BILL AROUND TO FIND AND THE LIABILITY ISSUES AND THE SAFETY PLANS. THERE ARE PARTS THAT I I LIKE IN THEIR PARTS THAT I'D LIKE GLASS ON BY IN TERMS OF ANY BILL THIS NODDED TO NO ONE IS GOING TO LOVE -- EVERYTHING ABOUT THE BILL IS GOING TO BE GOOD AND AND UNLESS COULD FROM ANY PARTICULAR PERSON'S PERSPECTIVE. A AND I DO WANT TO SAY THERE THERE ARE I AND I'VE SEEN THE NARRATIVE OUT THERE AMONG SOME MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT -- THAT A P. JEANNIE SETS US TO SORT OF AND THE SHAREHOLDERS JUST EAT IT AND FIND EVERYTHING IN THERE SHOULD BE ANY IMPACT ON THE RATE PAYERS AND I MEAN WE KNOW -- THAT'S UNFORTUNATELY I WOULD LOVE IF THAT COULD BE THE CASE THAT'S NOT REALITY THERE IS GOING TO BE AN IMPACT ON THE REPAIRS NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS WE SAW FROM THE CHARTS TODAY AND THAT'S INTUITIVE WE HAVE WHAT -- BY JERRY BROWN REFERRED TO AS THE NEW ABNORMAL -- AND TRAGICALLY -- WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO ALL ABSORBED US. AND AND THAT'S JUST THE REALITY OF IT -- AND IF IF OUR IT IF THAT WERE WHAT THIS THIS BILL WERE ACTUALLY LEFT TO THE CORE OF WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO IN TERMS OF DEALING WITH SOME OF THE LIABILITY ISSUES AND AND SO FORTH -- ABOUT WOULD BE -- ONE THING -- BUT MY CONCERN. ABOUT -- THE BILL WHILE I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT TODAY WITH ALL RESPECT TO THE AUTHORS INTO THE GOVERNOR. IS THAT -- I BELIEVE THAT THE BILL IS BOTH A MISSED OPPORTUNITY IN SOME RESPECTS -- AND IN ONE PARTICULAR RESPECT -- TAKES US BACKWARDS. OUR CURRENT SYSTEM IN TERMS OUR INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES IS BROKEN. IT IS A BROKEN MODEL THAT IS NOT WORKING FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THE WILD FIRES ARE ONLY THE MOST -- ARNOLD THE MOST DRAMATIC -- MANIFESTATION OF THAT FILURE WE'VE SEEN THE FAILURE AND OTHER RISK. RESPECTS AS WELL IT'S NOT WORKING -- AND WE NEEDTO LOOK TOWARDS THE FUTURE AND WHAT THAT MEANS FOR OUR POWER SYSTEM. AND I THINK IN TERMS OF THE MISSED OPPORTUNITY THERE WERE I THINK OF A GROUP OF US IN THE SENATE WHO HAD ASKED -- THAT THERE BE -- SOME PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL TO SAY WE'RE NOT JUST GOING TO TRY -- TO FREEZE A BROKEN SYSTEM IN AMBER. TO PATCH IT UP WITH TRIAGE OF COURSE WE HAVE TO DO TRIAGE -- BUT TO SAY WE'RE NOT ONLY GOING TO DO TRIAGE FOR BROKEN SYSTEM WE'RE ALSO GOING TO PLANT SEEDS FOR THE FUTURE. OF BURKE FUTURE OF A MORE DECENTRALIZED -- OR DISTRIBUTED APPROACH TO ENERGY AND SO WE ACT GAVE SOME IDEAS ABOUT -- DIFFERENT DVR DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCE COMPONENTS THAT GO INTO THE BILL NOTHING DRAMATIC ABOUT PLANTING THOSE SEEDS IN SENDING A CLEAR SIGNAL THAT WE'RE NOT JUST PATCHING UP A BROKEN SYSTEM. THAT WE ARE LOOKING TO THE FUTURE. WE DID NOT I DID NOT GOING TO THE BILL -- AND I I UNDERSTAND ALL THE DIFFERENT OPINIONS AROUND WHETHER THAT'S A GOING TO THE BILL -- FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT'S A MISSED OPPORTUNITY NOT TO HAVE DIED IN THE BILL IN THE PLANT THE SEEDS. OTHER THAN ON TOP OF THAT -- WERE SLIDING BACK AND THAT IS IN PARTICULAR -- THE PROVISION -- IN THERE IN THIS BILL NOW IN THIS LEGISLATION NOW THAT A WOMAN WILL MAKE IT EXCEPTIONALLY HARD MUCH HARDER THAN IT IS TODAY. TO FORM A NEW MUNICIPAL OR PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITY OR FOR AN EXISTING PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITY TO EXPAND -- THE THE LANGUAGE IN HERE AROUND -- PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES IS NOT JUST ABOUT THE LABOR PROTECTIONS I AM ALL. FOR MAKING SURE THAT AS YOU TRANSITION FROM A PRIVATELY OWNED UTILITY AND ITS ASSETS GOOD PURCHASE BY A PUBLIC ENTITY THAT THERE BE PROTECTIONS FOR THE WORKERS I SUPPORT THAT A PERCENT THIS BILL GOES WELL BEYOND THAT BY CREATING MANY NEW REQUIREMENTS AND MUCH GREATER CPUC OVERSIGHT. FOR NACHOS FOR US PUBLIC ANY ACQUIRING ENTIRE I OWE YOU BUT SIMPLY PURCHASING. ASSETS FROM THAT I OWE YOU NOT JUST MAKING SURE THAT A VALUATION IS ICE OF THE SHAREHOLDERS GET THEIR VALUE. BUT BROAD CPUC OVERSIGHT. IF THIS PASSES IN ITS CURRENT FORM AND THIS WAS THE THIS PARTICULAR LANGUAGE WAS PUT INTO THIS BILL -- LATE FRIDAY AFTERNOON -- OF A HOLIDAY WEEKEND LOT OF PEOPLE OF NOT EVEN PROCESS TO YET AND THIS IS A DRAMATIC SEA CHANGE. IN TERMS OF OUR ABILITY TO TRY A NEW MODEL MODEL THAT HAS WORKED THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN TERMS OF PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES. THE GOOD MODEL THIS BILL MAKES A DRAMATICALLY HARDER AND PERHAPS IMPOSSIBLE -- SO WITH ALL THAT SAID AGAIN THANK YOU TO THE GOVERNOR AND TO MEMBERS FOR MOVING THIS FOR THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD IN THIS BILL -- BUT THERE ARE SOME ASPECTS THAT MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO SUPPORT THE BILL [inaudible] THEY'RE NOT. YES THE THANKS MISTER CHAIR OF I FIRST ALL I I APPRECIATE -- ASSEMBLY MEMBERS HOLDEN MAYES. AND FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS AND GETTING IT. TO TO US TODAY ALONG WITH THE CHAIRMAN AWAY SO IN -- SENATOR -- HERTZBERG. YOU KNOW THIS IS AND ALSO IT'S BEEN A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH I THINK WITH THE TEAM FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. THEY DESERVE A LOT OF CREDIT FOR THE COLLABORATIVE APPROACH. TO DEVELOPING THE BILL AND IN FRANKLY TACKLING. ONE OF THE BETTER THE BIGGEST -- ISSUES THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US. I IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TODAY. I KNOW PLAN IS PERFECT BUT NEITHER IS THE WILDFIRE SITUATION WE FACE IS CALIFORNIANS. CLIMATE CHANGE IS DRIVING MORE DESTRUCTIVE FIRES AT EVER AT A TIME WITH THE STATE'S LARGEST UTILITY PGD HAS SADLY DUCT ITS RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER STATE LAW. THIS BILL REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THAT SOLUTION. IT WOULD HELP COMPENSATE PAST AND PRESENT VICTIMS. I PREVENT FUTURE DISASTERS AND PROTECT UTILITY RATE PAYERS FROM SUBSTANTIAL AN UNFAIR RATE INCREASES. CLEARLY IT'S A LIFELINE. FOR UTILITY CUSTOMERS MAKE NO MISTAKE THIS IS NOT A UTILITY BAIL OUT. IT'S A RATE PAYER BAILOUT. IT REQUIRES P. GENIE IN THE STATE'S OTHER TO BE YOU UTILITIES TO PONY UP FIVE NEEDED SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS. UTILITIES WILL BE ALLOWED TO MAKE A SET OF PROFIT FROM THESE EXPENSES. THE PLAN ALSO CREATES A FUND TO HELP SHIELD CUSTOMERS FROM COSTS OF ANY FUTURE WILD FIRES. IN THE THE COST OF CAPITAL THAT COME WITH THOSE RISKS. IT ALSO MANDATES A STRICT WHEN YOUR TIME LIFE FOR P. JEANNIE TO EMERGE FROM CHAPTER. ELEVEN INSURING THAT SETTLEMENTS ARE REACH WITH ALL TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN FIRE VICTIMS. WE MUST HOLD -- THESE COMPANIES -- THE COMPANY -- ACCOUNTABLE TO THAT END THE BILL REQUIRES STATE REGULATORS TO STEP UP OVERSIGHT. AND ENFORCEMENT OF YOU TO COMPANIES LIKE P. JEANNIE INCLUDING DOING PHYSICAL AUDIT I THINK THAT'S A VERY BIG IMPORTANT PART OF THIS. DOING NOTHING IS NOT AN OPTION IF WE SIT BY UTILITY RATE IDLY BY UTILITY RATES WOULD DOUBLE UNDER THE STATUS QUO. WE TOOK IMPORTANT STEPS LAST YEAR INCLUDING STRENGTHENING OUR FIRE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE CAPABILITIES AND WE BUILT ON THAT FOUNDATION IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET WITH SIGNIFICANT NEW INVESTMENTS. BUT THERE'S STILL MUCH MORE TO DO AS PART OF THE SOLUTION I HAVE -- INTRODUCED A HALF DOZEN WILDFIRES SAFETY BILLS -- THIS YEAR IN A NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES IN BOTH THE SENATE IN THE ASSEMBLY HAVE INTRODUCED A NUMBER OF BILLS THAT WILL HELP IN THIS REGARD. AS WE HELP ROUND OUT THE SOLUTION FOR THIS YEAR. BUT OUR FOCUS MUST REMAIN ON COMPENSATING VICTIMS STOPPING NEW WILDFIRES IN PREVENTING OUTRAGEOUS COST ON REPAIRS. THERE'S NO SILVER BULLET FOR THIS PROBLEM BUT THE LEGISLATURE HAS A CHANCE. AT TO MAKE MAJOR STRIDES NOW TOWARDS THOSE AIMS. IT CAN'T COME SOON ENOUGH AND I'D JUST WILL YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY -- WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS AND THINK THAT THIS IS YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT IS JUST SO IMPORTANT PARTICULARLY RIGHT NOW. OF FOR THOSE MEMBERS THAT HAVE -- YOU KNOW -- CONSTITUENTS IN THE SERVICE TERRITORIES -- SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC -- I THINK IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT -- IN THOSE AREAS THAT -- FOR PROTECTION OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS THAT THAT WE GET A YES VOTE ON THIS AS WELL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN [inaudible] MISTER CHAIR -- MY COLLEAGUES HAVE EXPRESSED THIS BUT I THINK IT'S BEARS REPEATING THAT WE HAVE A UTILITY THAT IS FAILED TO EMBRACE SAFETY CULTURE. AND SEVERELY WE SAW WITH THE SAN BRUNO INCIDENT WE SO AND WE FIND IT WITH FIRES. AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT. BY TH WHILE I THINK THIS BILL MAKES A SOME VERY IMPORTANT STEPS TOWARDS ENSURING THAT WE HOLD OUR ARE USED TO THE HIGHEST SAFETY STANDARDS. IT'S NOT ENOUGH YET I DON'T MEAN THAT THAT'S NOT IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL IT'S JUST THAT. TO ACHIEVE THE TYPE OF SAFETY THAT WE EXPECT IN EVERY CALIFORNIAN EXPECTS [inaudible] B. -- THIS NEXT BILL THAT NOT TODAY THAT WILL BE CONSIDERING THAT ESTABLISHES THE SEPARATE COMPLETELY SEPARATE DIVISION WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT HAS THE EXPERTISE IN THE AUTHORITY THAT WILL BE NEEDED. TO REALLY ACHIEVE. THAT SAFETY CULTURE WHICH WE CAN POINT A FINGER. AT THE I. R. USE BUT WE NEED TO ALSO POINT OUR FINGERS AT OURSELVES AND OUR REGULATORY COMMISSION. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE SEE JUST POINT FINGERS IT MEANS THAT WE HAVE -- TO IN. WE HAVE TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY IMPROVE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSION ON THAT NEXT ONE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO THAT AND THERE'S MUCH IN HERE. THAT HELPS AND BUT THE THING SEEN HERE THAT HELP OUR MORE THE ISSUES OF AN IMPROVED SAFETY CERTIFICATION. AND THE ISSUES AROUND -- PUTTING THE BURDEN. ON THE SHAREHOLDERS IF THAT UTILITY IS NOT BEEN SHOWN. TO HAVE YOU IF IT WAS SHOWN TO BE NEGLIGIBLE AND ALSO AS OTHER COLLEAGUES HAVE POINTED OUT. THE PARTS ABOUT THAT CORRECTLY LIMIT THE ABILITY BY -- USED TO REWARD EXACTS OR TO REWARD THEIR SHAREHOLDERS WHEN THEY ARE NICK NEGLIGENT SO THOSE THINGS. ARE VERY IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THIS BILL AND AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN FROM WHEN WE SAW IT A WEEK AGO OUR GREAT IMPROVEMENTS IN THAT AREA SO I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT -- I THINK THAT. IN OUR QUEST TO REALLY IMPROVE THE SAFETY. AND AGAIN THAT WILL -- THERE'S NOT A LOT OF DETAIL IN HERE. BUT WE NEED TO ALSO LOOK AT TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE THE WITH THIS WITH THE FACT THAT WE ARE IN A CLIMATE. CHAOS WORLD NOW THERE'S NO BACKING AWAY FROM THAT WE MAY AVOID FARD MUCH FURTHER WORST CATASTROPHIC CLIMATE CHANGE BUT WE ARE IN A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE. AS WE KNOW ALREADY FROM THE DATA WHERE WE ARE GOING TO BE HOTTER. AND WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE THE NIGHT TIME COOLING. WE ARE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE PATTERNS THAT CREATE WILDFIRES IN THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN REMOVE THE VEGETATION OR COMPLETELY ELIMINATE THE DEVELOPMENT THAT IS OCCURRED IN OUR URBAN WILDLAND INTERFACE SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE FIRES. AND MANY OF THEM WILL BE. BECAUSE OF SPARKS FROM THIS UTILITY EQUIPMENT THE TWO HUGE STATE. SOME TECHNOLOGIES ARE AVAILABLE TO US TO GIVE US THE REAL TIME INFORMATION WHEN THOSE SPARKS OCCUR AND WE NEED TO USE MORE TO THAT BECAUSE WE DO NOT THE STATE DOES NOT ADDRESS ENOUGH OF IT BUT THAT WE CAN DEAL WITH IN THAT NEXT BILL BUT I JUST THINK. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO BRING IT UP -- BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT FOR MY COLLEAGUES HAVE BEEN -- MENTIONED THAT WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL NOT. TO MAKE THIS TO ROSY THIS BILL WILL AND I'M GLAD WE GOT TO CLARIFICATION WILL IMPROVE OVER THE GRAPHS THAT WE GOT. FROM -- FIRST REISMAN SIMILAR TO GAVE US GRAPHS THAT SHOW A PRETTY SCARY PROJECTION OF RATE INCREASES. THIS BILL WILL HELP TO NOT SO THAT WE DON'T HIT THAT SCARY PROJECTION BUT IT WILL NOT ELIMINATE ALL READING CREASES BECAUSE IF WE'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY IMPROVE SAFETY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SPEND SOME MONEY. AND FOR ACTUALLY GET A HOLD THE UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE MEANING YOU THE PROPER SAFETY CULTURE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SPEND SOME MONEY BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO INCREASE OUR OWN EXPERTISE AND THAT WILL REQUIRE HIRING SOME PEOPLE. SO. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO RATE INCREASES. BUT I THINK THIS BY TAKING THIS ACTION NOW WE ARE GOING. TO TO GIVE US SOME -- ALL OF OUR ONE EASTWARD INSURANCE BUT SOME. QUESTION FROM THAT HORRIBLE PROJECTION THAT ARE ON THOSE GRAPHS THAT YOU SHOWED US -- THE% OTHER THING I LIKE ABOUT THE BILL AS AMENDED IS THAT IT COVERS THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FIRE VICTIMS THE ORIGINAL BILL DID NOT. AND I APPRECIATE THAT SO THERE'S MUCH IN HERE THAT I THINK FOR IMPROVEMENTS AND THE ONLY THING I WOULD SPEAK TO IS. A YOU KNOW I'M NOT A FAN OF OUR CURRENT UTILITY MODEL. I DON'T THINK THAT IT ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE TYPE OF CHANGES THAT WE HAVE BEEN MAKING TO TRUST OUR WHOLE WAY OF OF GENERATING ELECTRICITY OF WHO PURCHASES PURCHASES IT OF WHO DELIVERS ENERGY SERVICES. THE FACT THAT WE HAVE EMBRACE THE ENERGY SERVICES ARE FAR MORE THAN JUST THE DELIVERY OF ENERGY. BUT I THINK THAT RIGHT NOW WE WE TO THINK ABOUT EXACTLY HOW. WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE RIGHT MODEL FOR CALIFORNIA THAT TAKES A LOT MORE TIME? AND WE'RE IN A SITUATION NOW WHERE WE HAVE FIRE YOU STRUCTURE AS IT EXISTS SO WE NEED TO ACT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE AS EXIST. UNTIL WE HAVE DONE THE PROPER TIME PROPER WORK TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT WOULD REPLACE IT. THAT DOESN'T EXIST NOW WE NEED IT TO BE DELIVERING THE SERVICE AS BEST AS POSSIBLE WITH THE SAFETY CULTURE AND WITH THE LEAST -- DAMAGE IN TERMS A RAINY CREASES TO OUR REGULAR CALIFORNIANS WILL WE SEE REPAIRS WE MEAN REGULAR CALIFORNIA. SO THAT'S WHY I LIKE THE BILL NOW BECAUSE WE'RE IN THIS IMMEDIATE CRISIS NOW. BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING ON SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE THAT MAY BE MORE DRAMATIC. THANK YOU. CENTER CHIANG FOLLOWED BY CENTER BRADFORD. MISTER CHAIR -- FIRST I'D LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR'S BILLING NOTES ON EASY ISSUE AND IT'S CRITICAL. TO TO BE ABLE TO PUT SOMETHING FORWARD -- THIS POLICY IS GOING TO BE A HUGE SHIFT ON OUR OF STATES RULES ON WILDFIRE AND UTILITIES BUT I GOTTA BE HONEST I MEAN THE BILL WAS IN PRINT FRIDAY EVENING AND I AM STILL UNABLE TO ASCERTAIN THE IMPACT ON RATE PAYERS I KNOW CENTER SKINNER. WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT AND I JUST STARTED GETTING A FLOOD OF PHONE CALLS FROM FOLKS IN MY DISTRICT -- EXPRESSING SOME CONCERNS. BUT I WILL SAY THAT. I AM OPEN MINDED AGAIN I APPLAUD THE EFFORT OF THE AUTHORS AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE BUT YEAH THERE'S A TON OF MOVING PARTS AND I STILL HAVE TO CONSIDER THE IMPACT ON RATE PAYERS AND AND I'M STILL -- NOT HAVING OF A FULL GRASP OF THAT AND SO TODAY I'M GOING TO BE LAYING OFF AND AND FURTHER STAYING THIS ISSUE BUT AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD NOT BE -- TAKING A LOOK AT IT LATER CENTER BRADFORD. THIS WILL BE VERY BRIEF FOR MY COMMENTS BUT I TWO ONE APPLAUD THE AUTHORS AND THE MEASURE THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US BECAUSE OF THE INDIVIDUAL WHO WORK FOR UTILITY COMPANY IF YOU WOULD. IF I WOULD IT YOU ASKED ME A YEAR AGO FIVE YEARS AGO TEN YEARS AGO THAT YOU WOULD TAKE. HOW THE BILL WITH THE UTILITIES TAKING SUCH? OWNERSHIP. OF LIABILITY AND YOUR SHAREHOLDERS -- PEEN LE LEVEL WHAT THEIR PAIN AND THEIR EXECUTIVES TAKING THESE COMPENSATION IT I WOULD SAY IT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN. BECAUSE THAT WAS NOT THE CULTURE OF INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES I JEERED UTILITIES IN ASSEMBLY AND WE HAD TO SAN BRUNO. HEARING AND WE FOUGHT. FOR RATE SHAREHOLDERS TO PAY THAT LIABILITY WE'RE SUCCESSFUL THERE BUT PART OF THAT -- YOU VERY RARELY GET SHAREHOLDERS EVER TAKE A HIT ON ANY OF THE LIABILITIES ACOSTA -- UTILITIES MIGHT OF COST I WOULD BE VERY CLEAR UTILITIES ARE NOT CAUSING ANY MORE FIRES TODAY THAN THEY DID TWENTY YEARS AGO. THEIR EQUIPMENT IS NOT CAUSING ANY MORE WHAT WE HAVE IS A CLIMATE CHANGE WE ALL BELIEVE IN CLIMATE CHANGE WE HAVE A DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT OUT THERE. WE HAVE. ODD TREES THAT ARE NOT BEING MANAGED I MEAN EVEN CONGRESSMAN GARAMENDI SAYS WE HAVE DONE A POOR JOB AT MANAGING OUR FORCED AND THAT'S A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR AS WELL. SO THAT'S WHY I WAS HASN'T IT AT FIRST ON TRYING TO JUST. BANG BANG BANG ON THE UTILITY AND SAY THEY HAVE A 100% LIABILITY ON THIS THING YES THEY HAVE SOME RESPONSIBILITY AND I THINK THIS MESS -- THIS BILL. HOLD HIM TO THAT MAKES HIM PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE MY CONCERN IS ALSO THOSE -- SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FIRE VICTIMS AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE PAID QUICKLY AND DO WE HAVE ANY TIME FRAME ON HOW SOON THEY WILL BE MADE WHOLE BECAUSE THE SEE IT IN THIS. BILL AND THEY STILL WAIT TWO OR THREE YEARS DOWN THE ROAD WE HAVE REALLY NOT HELP THEM IF THAT'S THE CASE. AND MY OTHER CONCERN EVEN THOUGH THIS BILL DOES NOT ADDRESS IT IS. MY FEAR OF A HEDGE FUNDS OF COMING IN AND CAL CANNIBALIZING UTILITIES WHETHER IT'S P. GINNY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON THE GAS COMPANY -- I I I I WISH WE HAD A BETTER STAY IN THE METHOD OF HOW WE FIND. THIS PAY OUT BECAUSE I AM FAVOR OF THE EQUITY CONTRIBUTION BOND BUT I UNDERSTAND THIS BILL DOES NOT ADDRESS THAT. AND THOSE ARE THE CONCERNS I HAVE GOING FOR BECAUSE IF IT WOULD LOOKED IT UP TO THE HEDGE FUNDS. I'M FEARFUL WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO NOT ONLY. PJ BUT ARE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES AS A WHOLE AND WE SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT BECAUSE SENATOR ARE HERTZBERG AND I BOTH LIVE TO THE ENERGY CRISIS HE AS THE SPEAKER AND I AS AN EMPLOYEE OF EDISON. AND THE LAST THING YOU WANT IS ANOTHER CRISIS BASED ON FUNDING AND RELIABILITY AND THE TWO THINGS THAT UTILITIES ARE CONCERNED ABOUT DESPITE WHAT YOU MIGHT READ IS SAFETY AND RELIABILITY. THOSE ARE ALWAYS THE TWO TOP PILLARS OF ANY UTILITY COMPANY SAFETY A RIB RELIABILITY PROFITS ALWAYS THIRTY MIGHT NOT COME OUT LIKE THAT BUT THEY'VE ALWAYS CHAMPION SAFETY AND RELIABILITY LEE FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON WHERE I WORKED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WANNA THANK EVERYBODY FOR THEIR COMMENTS AND WE HAVE ONE MORE CENTER [inaudible] I'M DONE. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- I ONE OF FIRST OF ALL -- THANK ALL THE THE AUTHORS SAID TO HAVE -- WORK TOGETHER TO TRY TO GET US TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY -- ASSEMBLYMAN CHAD MAYES IS -- COMMUNICATED WITH THE CENTER DOT HOUSE I HAD ABOUT AN HOUR CONVERSATION ON A PLANE WITH SENATOR HERTZBERG -- BUT I SHARE THE SAME CONCERNS THAT I DO WITH -- CENTER CHIANG OF THIS IS A LARGE DOCUMENT THIS IS A COMPLEX BILL -- I'D I THINK WE SHOULD BE DOING EVERYTHING WE POSSIBLY CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT THE VICTIMS ARE ARE PAID -- AND PAID AS PROMPTLY AS POSSIBLE I THINK IT'S A IT'S HORRIFIC THAT WE'RE WE'RE HERE TODAY. FOR FIRES THAT HAVE HAPPENED -- QUITE A FEW MINUTES AGO AND AND THESE PEOPLE ARE STILL BEING IMPACTED TODAY I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS THE SILVER BULLET TODAY THAT'S GONNA. GET THEM KIND OF FUNDING THAT THEY NEED -- POST HASTE BUT I AM STILL CONCERNED ABOUT -- THE RATE PAYERS -- BECAUSE YOU HAVE A POOL OF REPAIRS THAT ARE GOING TO BE GIVEN AN ASSESSMENT AND YOU HAVE. PEOPLE THAT HAVE MEANS THAT HAVE. PUT SOLAR PANELS ON THEIR ON THE ROOF THAT ARE NOT GOING TO BE PAYING INTO THE FUND. WE HAVE A NEW REQUIREMENT TWENTY TWENTY THAT ALL HOMES ARE GOING TO BE BUILT WITH SOLAR PANELS THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE PAYING INTO THE FUND. AND SO YOU'RE IN A SMALL UNIVERSE WHICH OF COURSE INCLUDES OUR BUSINESSES THAT ARE ALREADY SAYING THE HIGHEST UTILITY RATES PROBABLY IN THE COUNTRY. FORCING SOME OF THEM TO MAKE AS EXECUTIVE DECISIONS TO TO MOVE OUT OF THE STATE WE'VE ACTUALLY HEARD FROM MY ONE OF THE MEMBERS AND NOT IN OPPOSITION THAT THEY WERE HOPING. AFTER THIS -- FEE THAT WAS PAYING OFF BONDS WOULD BE GONE THAT THEY BE SAYING A FOUR FIVE AND THOUSAND DOLLAR -- AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IT WOULD HAVE TO EXPAND YEAR AFTER YEAR. SO -- IT'S VERY DIFFICULT WITH HER REPUBLICAN AND YOU HAVE VERY LITTLE STAFF THE BILL TO GO THROUGH AND AND COMPREHENSIVELY UNDERSTAND. ALL THE DETAILS OF THE BILL WE DID THE BEST WE POSSIBLY CAM -- BUT I STILL HAVE MANY MANY MORE QUESTIONS THAT I'M NOT SURE NOT GOING TO BRING THE COMMITTEE WITH BUT IN ITS PRESENT FORM TODAY -- WITHOUT THE EXPLICIT PROOF THAT ARE VICTIMS ARE GOING TO SEE -- SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE PAYMENTS AND BEING FAIR TO THOSE VICTIMS AND TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE RATE PAYERS THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD TOO MUCH OF A DISCUSSION WITH TODAY THAT ALREADY -- AT LEAST IN MY DISTRICT WHEN YOU HAVE A HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN DEGREES AND AND THE PALM SPRINGS AREA PEOPLE UP TO USE THEIR AIR CONDITIONING -- ESSIE IS A BIG UTILITY OUT THERE THESE THESE FOLKS MANY OF THEM THAT ARE LOW INCOME JUST CAN'T AFFORD TO SEE MORE INCREASES OF THEIR UTILITY RATES -- TO SUBSIDIZE -- PROBLEMS THAT -- ARE OUR LARGEST UTILITY HAS -- HAS DONE AND THEN YOU HAVE A COLLECTIVE FEE OF FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AT THE UTILITIES ARE GOING TO BE PUTTING TOGETHER FOR THIS FUND. AND YOU KNOW SOMEONE I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT THAT -- SDG ANNIE THIS ALREADY HARDENED OR LINES OF ALREADY COME UP WITH A COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM I WOULD CALL THE MODEL -- FOR MITIGATING THE THE IMPACTS OF WILDFIRE WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTION WHY THEY SHOULD HAVE. TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS FUND -- AFTER THEY'VE ALREADY SPENT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY -- AFTER THE MITIGATION OF THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SOME ODD MILLION DOLLARS A DAY TO PAY FOR THE THE FIRES THAT HAPPENED EARLY IN THE IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND'S. SO -- IN ITS PRESENT FORM TODAY -- I CAN'T SUPPORTED APPRECIATE THE GOOD WORK OF ALL THE THE AUTHORS -- I WISH I HAD MORE STAFF AND MORE TIME TO BETTER UNDERSTAND ALL THE IMPACTS -- TO MY CONSTITUENTS BUT YOU KNOW THE VICTIMS DID COME FIRST IN THE RATE PAYERS INTO COME SECOND. AND BOOKED UP OR ME MY PRIORITIES AS WE MOVE FORWARD THANK YOU. THERE ARE HERTZBERG. BRIEFLY ARM TO CABINET SECRETARY ON THE I I HEARD. THE EASY WITH RESPECT TO SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE THAT EDISON INDICATED THAT IT WAS SUPPORTING ARMED AND OBVIOUSLY IN THE AGREEMENT. JUDY CAN'T SPEAK FOR ITSELF BECAUSE THE SUBJECT TO THE FEDERAL COURT. BUT YOU PUT A PROVISION THAT REQUIRES AS PART OF THE CLOTHES THAT THAT MEANS PART OF THE CONCLUSION OF THE PROCEEDINGS THAT. THIS HAS TO BE THAT THEY HAVE TO AGREE TO THIS -- INSURANCE FUND MY QUESTION IS. IT HAS TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE HAS SOME BROUGHT SUPPORT BUT AGREED TO SUPPORT THIS MEASURE. BUT WE'VE WORKED WITH ALL THREE UTILITIES BOTH IN TERMS OF THE CONSTRUCT OF THE UTILITIES AS WELL AS THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE RELATIVE COST OF THINKING ABOUT THE CENTERS POINT PART OF THE BECAUSE OF THERE'S A RECOGNITION OF WORSE AND GAS ELECTRIC WHICH IS WHY THEY WOULD HAVE. THE SMALL SHARE CONTRIBUTION TO THE FUND SO WE WORK WITH ALL THREE UTILITIES AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THEY SEE THIS AS A SALUTE THERE'S A PATH FORWARD YEAH BECAUSE IT THE REALITY IS IT IN. ALLOCATING THIS RECORD YOUR ALLOCATION FORMULA IT'S ABOUT SIXTY FOUR POINT 4% FOR PER P. JEANNIE. AND MUCH SMALLER PERCENTAGES THE SMALLEST PERCENTAGE OF X. X. OR SOMETHING PERCENT. FOR FOR FOR SAMPRAS SO THAT IT TO THE EXTENT IT IS REWARDED FOR HIS GOOD BEHAVIOR. GET GIVEN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES THE LAST THING I WANT TO SAY IS THAT. THERE IS A TWO THERE'S TWO FUNDS AND THERE'S AN ELECTION ON THIS REQUIRED WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS DO YOU HAVE ANY INDICATION AS TO WHETHER AT LEAST THE TWO FINANCIALLY VIABLE ENTITIES. ADJUST INVESTOR UTILITIES OF ELECTED OR INTENT TO ELECT -- THE INSURANCE FUND -- EXPECTATIONS THEY WILL LOOK TO THE INSURANCE FUND PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT SAY THE THE PERMANENCY TEST THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN THEIR LIQUIDITY FUND WOULD BE THE PRE THE SB. NINE OH ONE SO WE THINK BASED ON BASED ON THE PRESSURES OF THEIR THAT THEY'RE EXPERIENCING RELATIVE TO STABILITY. WE THINK THE INSURANCE FUND WAS GOING TO BE THEIR CHOICE LAST POINT OBVIOUSLY GIVEN THEIR SUPPORT INDICATED THAT THE ALLOCATION FORMULA OR SOMETHING THAT THEY AGREE TO WHICH THAT AVOIDS LITIGATION GOING DOWN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU. CENTER STERN. MR. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES ALSO FOR THE DEPTH. OF ENGAGEMENT HERE I AM ONE OF THOSE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FIRE VICTIMS -- SO ARE MY BEST FRIENDS IN MY HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH TEACHER AND EVERYONE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD I GREW UP IN AND WHEN THE GOVERNOR SHOWED UP. WHEN HE FIRST TOOK OFFICE? ANY PROMISED THAT HE WAS GONNA. ADDRESS THIS CHALLENGE. I DIDN'T EXPECT IT. WOULD BE HERE TODAY. AND THE THE COMPLEXITY OF A WHAT IT MEANS TO ACT ON A CHALLENGE THIS COMPLEX IS IS OBVIOUS BUT TWENTY BILLS TONGUE WHEN THE PRESIDENT CAME TO TOWN AND DID THE RIGHT THING AND THEN PUT POLITICS INTO AN EMERGENCY. AND THEN PUT THE DILIGENCE IN WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND THE TEAM HE BROUGHT ON THE FIRST CLASS. TEAM HE BROUGHT ON TO ACTUALLY WORK ON MECHANICS HERE -- IN THE COALITION THAT YOU ALL OF BILL. I THINK. THERE'S REPEATING. TO HAVE A COALITION THAT INCLUDES VICTIMS. AND RATE PAYER ADVOCATES. AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY. ELEMENT PROGRESSING UTILITY INDUSTRY EVEN I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU YOU PULL THIS OFF TO BE HONEST MISS BONTA SANTOS -- AND NOW THIS GOVERNOR DID IT VOTE -- HE DELIVERED ON HIS PROMISE. NOW. IS THERE PROMISE FULLY MET NOT YET. WE ARE WORK TO DO -- BUT I TRUST NOW IN THIS ADMINISTRATION AT THEIR WORD IS GOOD AND THEN WHEN HE WALKED THROUGH THOSE ASHES THAT WAS. NOT A PHOTO OP -- SO I THINK THE AUTHORS FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD BECAUSE THIS IS VERY REAL FOR MANY PEOPLE. AND THE NOTION SOMEHOW THAT -- VICTIMS. ARE GOING TO BE BETTER OFF WITHOUT US MOVING A MEASURE HERE I THINK IS FALSE I KNOW IT'S AN ANXIETY PRODUCING EFFORT ACT AND I AGREE. WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO THAT THERE'S SERIOUS. CHALLENGES THAT REMAIN AND I'M FRUSTRATED AND I KNOW WHETHER IT'S A CLASSY INSURANCE MARKETS. WHETHER IT'S THE OPPORTUNITY IS NOT SEIZED IN THE ENERGY IS ATION AND USING D. E. R. RESOURCES TO GET OUT THERE AND COMMUNITIES AND ACTUALLY EMPOWER PEOPLE TO FEEL SAFE. THE STRUCTURAL ISSUES THE MOST CENTER FROM BERKELEY BROUGHT UP -- THOSE THOSE ARE REAL THAT'S REAL WORK TO DO. AND I TAKE YOU AT YOUR WORD TO SAY YOU'RE GOING TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON BUT I THINK WE'VE GOT TO RECOGNIZE HERE TODAY THAT THE COST OF INACTION IS TOO GREAT. AND THERE'S TOO MANY PEOPLE WITH THEIR LIVELIHOOD AND THEIR LIVES LOOKING AT A PILE OF DIRT. ONE OF OUR VICTIMS HERE TODAY TALK ABOUT STERN APOLOGY -- I'M SURE A LOT OF PILES OF DIRT MYSELF BACK HOME. I'M I MOVED OUT BUT MY APARTMENT NOW IS YOU KNOW. SURROUNDED IT IS WILL WE RIGHT WE WE LIVE IN THIS NEW WORLD AND PEOPLE TO KNOW WHAT THAT WORD WORD MET. BUT IT'S NOT DONE. AND THE CHALLENGES AROUND. NOT THE FORESTRY IN THE NORTH COAST NO AND AND NOT THE THE DEEP BIG TREES WHICH WE ALL KNOW WE'VE GOT TO GO TACKLE THOSE ISSUES IS RESOURCES CHAIR WE ARE TAKING A PROACTIVE STANCE AND FORCE YOU MANAGEMENT BUT THAT URBAN INTERFACE. THOSE PEOPLE LIVING IN HILLSIDE COMMUNITIES WHERE THE RISK IS TO REAL WERE INSURANCES CAN'T BEING CANCELED OR NON RENEWED -- WE'VE GOT A STEP UP SO I KNOW THERE'S WORK TO DO FOR THE REST OF THIS SESSION. WE'VE GOT TO FIND OTHER REVENUES OTHER STRUCTURES ACTUALLY HARDEN NOTCHES HOMES BUT COMMUNITIES -- AND WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE VICTIMS HAVE SOME HOPE IN THE FUTURE WHAT I SEE HERE IS. A RATE PAYER BY IN THE PALES IN COMPARISON TO A SHAREHOLDER BY IN A FRAMEWORK. THAT FAVORS VICTIMS. ARM AND SOME HOPE. MECHANICS ARE HARD. IT IS A COMPLEX BILL. BUT THAT'S WE GET PAID TO DO HERE. AND SO I'M JUST. I'M HUMBLED BY THE THE GRAVITY OF ALL THIS AND I TRUST IN THE DILIGENCE OF THAT'S BEEN DONE BY STAFF BY THE ADMINISTRATION BY THE AUTHORS. AND YOU CAN. YOU CAN BET THAT WE'RE GONNA BE KEEPING A DARN GOOD I ON THIS GOING FORWARD AT THE OVERSIGHT ON ONGOING BASEIF THINGS NEED TO BE FIXED THEY WILL BE FIXED. BUT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS MEASURE TODAY. SHE EIGHT WITH THE GOVERNOR'S DONE IN STEPPING UP AND DOING THE HARD WORK BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT. AND WE COULD JUST LET IT GO A COLLAPSING THE STATE CALIFORNIA'S ENTIRE FISCAL FRAMEWORK AND LEAVING VICTIMS ON THE LINE IS UNACCEPTABLE. THAT'S WHAT WE SUPPORT THE MEASURE TODAY. I WANT TO THANK MEMBERS FURTHER COMMENTS AND THIS IS TRULY -- CITIZENS LEGISLATURE AND THIS. THIS BODY THIS. COMMITTEE IS ACTUALLY MADE UP OF PEOPLE THAT BRING. THE SOME AMAZING -- PERSONAL OF STORIES AND BACKGROUNDS AND EXPERIENCES BOTH HAVING SEVEN SOMEBODY THAT WORKED. WITHIN INDUSTRY HAVING SOMEBODY THAT LOST THEIR HOME IN A WILDFIRE -- AND HAVING OTHER MEMBERS THAT HAVE SERVED IN DIFFERENT CAPACITIES -- WAS CENTER HILL -- THE FIGHTING FIRST CONTEST CONSTITUENTS WILD P. JEANNIE A NOR HIS. HIS HIS CRIES FOR HELP. A IT'S JUST BEEN AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND FOR ANYONE TO SUGGEST THAT THAT WERE RUSHING INTO A A LAST MINUTE ACTION HASN'T BEEN HERE. FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS. TO DEAL WITH THE THE THE NUMEROUS AMOUNT OF ISSUES THAT WE'VE BEEN JUST. AGONIZING OVER HOPING. I WISH WE HAD DONE THIS A YEAR AGO. I THINK WE NEEDED TO DO THIS A YEAR AGO I NEED WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO BRING SOME REFORM TO A PROCESS IS BROKEN. NOBODY CAN IN GOOD FAITH STAND HERE AND DEFEND THE STATUS QUO. WHEN IT'S PHILLY IN SO MANY PEOPLE'S FAILING? OF THE RATE PAYERS IT'S FAILING. THE PEOPLE THAT ARE NOW STANDING ON THE LINE ASKING FOR HELP THE VICTIMS THERE SO NUMEROUS NOW. SO IT'S IT'S HARD TO LOOK AT THIS ACTION IS THIS IS OF A MASSIVE BILL AND IT'S SURPRISING TO ME I JUST WANNA ALSO. I GIVE SOME KUDOS TO EVERYONE HERE THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE FOR YOU KNOW EVERY SINGLE LITTLE BILL NO MATTER WHAT IT DOES IS IS. IS IS GOOD AT DERIVING OPPOSITION IN SUPPORT. AND THIS BILL. DOES NOT HAVE A LONG LIST ON EITHER COLUMN WHICH TELLS ME. IT'S A PRETTY DARN GOOD MEASURE. AND AND THOSE ARE USUALLY THE GOOD LOS RIGHT THE ONES THAT THAT THE FIND IT HARD TO FOLLOW TO GET A LONG LIST OF SUPPORT. FOR AND ALONG LIST OF OPPOSITION BEFORE SO. BUT I AM LOOKING AT THIS BILL IN THE VARIOUS CODE SECTION SAYING THIS IS THINK THINGS THAT WE HAVE DISCUSSED FOR TWO YEARS. THIS IS NOTHING NEW THIS IS NOT. A NEW ID -- THERE THERE THERE WERE A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE DISCUSS OR PUT ON THE TABLE. WE SYSTEMATICALLY REMOVED SOME THINGS FROM THE TABLE CUP CAPS ON OTHERS ON THERE'S A LITTLE. BIT OF RED MEAT FOR THE MASSES IN HERE THAT I I JUST DISAGREE WITH -- IN IN THE WAY -- ESPECIALLY FOR THE UTILITY THAT I REPRESENT. BUT I FEEL HAS BEEN DOING A GOOD JOB IN IN IN HARDENING THE GREAT IN SAN DIEGO AND BECOMING MORE RESPONSIVE. AND BRING IN THE THE RIGHT TALENT. TO SERVE -- TO TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. IN SAN DIEGO THE MESSAGES. WE'RE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN REDUCE WILDFIRES OR ON OUR UTILITY IS OUR PARTNER IN THAT EFFORT AND IN HERE WE WE HAVE A PROVISION. PUNISHING THERE THE THEM AND ARE THE WAY THEY COMPENSATE. THEIR OFFICERS AND THEIR TOP LEVEL STAFF THAT'S FOR ME READ ME FOR THE MASSES PUTTING SOME AND HERE'S SHOWS THAT WERE HARD. ON THE UTILITIES WE NEED TO BE HARDER WHAT WILDFIRES. AND AND I DISAGREE WITH THAT PART OF THE BILL I THINK IT'S GOING TO HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES GOING DOWN THE LINE. ESPECIALLY FOR MY UTILITY. I CAN ARGUE PIDGIN PIDGEON A DESERVES IT. AND AND P. GINNY THAT NEED SO IT'S KIND OF CODES BECAUSE THEY HAVE THEY HAVE STRUGGLED WITH THE HAVING A SAFETY CULTURE. OF I DON'T I CAN'T SAY THAT FOR FOR SAN DIEGO AND I DON'T KNOW WHY WERE PUNISHING THEM. BUT LARGELY IF YOU READ THIS BILL. IF YOU LOOK AT THE PROVISIONS OF FAT BILL. AND IF YOU GO THROUGH THE PROVISIONS THIS IS. A BILL THAT EMPHASIZES PUTS. UP MAKES OF A VALUE STATEMENT ABOUT HOW THREATENING WILDFIRES ARE AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO THE HARD IN THE GRID. AND THE THE BILL TALKS ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO HARD IN THE GRILL. GRID. AND AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THE CHILES OF ACCOUNTABLE FOR HARD IN THE GRID. BUT MANY THE REASONS ARE GREAT IS IS IS WEEKEND IS BECAUSE OF THE UC HAS NOT AUTHORIZED. A LOT OF THOSE INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS BECAUSE THEY INCREASE RATES. AND FOR PEOPLE TO COME HERE TALKING ABOUT IT YOU KNOW OF SURE THE STRENGTHENING THE GRANT THAT COSTS MONEY AND THEY TALK ABOUT A PERFECT WORLD IN A PERFECT WORLD IT WOULD BE FREE. TO HARDEN THE GRID BUT IT'S NOT TRUE. THANK KEEPING RATES LOW I THINK HAS BEEN. THE NUMBER ONE DIRECTIVE. OF THE P. YOU SEE AND TURN AND THIS LEGISLATURE AND ALL OF ADVOCATES ARE ALWAYS FIGHTING FOR KEEP RATES LOW BECAUSE HAVING LOW RATES ARE ESSENTIAL. TO CALIFORNIANS QUALITY OF LIFE IN OUR ECONOMY AND ENSURING THAT. PEOPLE THAT CAN AFFORD TO PAY FOR POWER HAVE POWER IN THEIR HOMES BECAUSE IT'S SO. ESSENTIAL. TO PEOPLE'S HEALTH AND WELL BEING AND THE IN MY DISTRICT IF YOU DON'T HAVE AIR CONDITIONING YOU CAN DIE. AND IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD IT YOU CAN DIE. AND SO THAT'S WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT KEEPING RATES LOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAINTAINING PEOPLE'S LIVES AND SOME OF THE SOME PARTS OF THE STATE SO YOU. WE'RE MAKING A A STATEMENT HERE THAT. HAVING POWER HAVING ENERGY IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR WELL BEING IN OUR PROSPERITY IN OUR STATE'S ECONOMY AND OUR OF OUR HEALTH. AND THAT'S WHAT THE BOOK BILL IS MOSTLY ABOUT IT'S ABOUT HARDEN IN THE GREAT IT'S ABOUT MAKING IT SAFE TO ABOUT BEING-RESPONSIVE. AND IF YOU YOU CAN'T LOOK AT AT THE BILL ON ITS OWN BECAUSE WE HAVE ALSO ENACTED OTHER LAWS. SB NINE OH ONE WHICH IS -- WHICH IS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THIS BUILDING SB -- TEN TEN TWENTY EIGHT WELL. BY OUR VERY OWN CENTER HILL THAT. REQUIRES I OWE YOU ELECTRIC UTILITIES TO FILE ON YOU WHILE FIRE MITIGATION PLANS. AND A HOST OF OTHER BILLS THAT GET TO PUBLIC. SAFETY AND BE MORE RESPONSIVE AND SETTING ASIDE MONEY AT IN THE BUDGET TO MAKE OUR OUR CAL FIRE -- EQUIPPING THEM WITH THE EQUIPMENT THEY NEED TO FIGHT FIRES AND OUR OUR FORESTRY PROGRAM GIVING THEM THE RESOURCES THEY NEED. TO TO REDUCE WIRE FILED OUR FLOORS AGIAN I MEAN I COULD GO ON AND ON AND ON AND I WON'T FOR THE PURPOSES OF GETTING THROUGH THIS BUT WE HAVE MADE. NUMEROUS NEW THE TAKEN NUMEROUS EFFORTS PASSED SEVERAL BILLS THAT GET TO BECOMING MORE RESPONSIVE TO WILDFIRES REDUCING. THE INTENSITY OF OUR WILDFIRES AND HOPEFULLY. ELIMINATING WILDFIRES IF THAT'S EVEN AT ALL POSSIBLE BUT NO WE IN. THAT IN THE CASE WE'D WE DON'T DO THAT WE CAN GO OUT OF BUSINESS HERE. IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE PEOPLE WITH WILLOW TRICITY SO AND ADDED MOVE THE BILL THE PUBLIC TIMES GERMAN THANKS VERY MUCH -- CENTER HERTZBERG SO THAT'S MY THAT'S MY ARGUMENT WHY WE NEED THIS BILL. IT'S WAY LONG OVERDUE. AND I'M FINALLY I'M GLAD THAT WE HAVE. BEEN ABLE -- TO THE MOST MEMBERS OF STATE -- THAT ARE HERE HAVE. PUT IN A LOT OF TIME TO GET TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF TIME. AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS OF THIS BILL FOR STEPPING OVER THE PART OF THE SOLUTION. AND AND I KNOW THAT ALL OF YOU HAVE BEEN PART OF THE SOLUTION FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS. IN IN IN HAVING THIS DEBATE AND DIALOGUE IN RAISING THESE ISSUES AND GO THROUGH THE STEPS. AND AGAIN -- WE HAVE A MOTION AND IF DID YOU WANT TO MAKE CLOSING COMMENTS -- EACH OF IT DID EACH OF YOU ONE OF MICHAEL AND CLOSING COMMENTS OR RAISE YOUR AND YOU WANT MY CLOSING COMMENTS OKAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. I JUST -- IN IN OUR CLOTHES I-KNOW THIS IS BEEN A ROBUST -- HEARING. AND I'M HEARTENED BY IT IN FACT I WOULD SUGGEST TO YOU THAT MY FIFTH YEAR IN THE LEGISLATURE NOW -- THIS COMMITTEE HAS BEEN -- ONE AFFECTED HAS BEEN THE BEST. IT IS OBVIOUS THAT YOU ALL HAVE DONE YOUR HOMEWORK AND THIS IS SOMETHING THATHAS BEEN -- DELIBERATED ABOUT NOW. FOR SOME TIME. I ONE OF MY POLITICAL MENTORS POLICY MENTORS THAT TOLD ME CHAD WATCHER PRONOUNS. IT'S NOT I IT'S WE AND AS A YOUNG ELECTED OFFICIAL A MEMBER WAS HARD FOR ME TO GET OVER THAT SOMEWHERE TO SAY AYE AYE AYE AND THE REALITY IS IS WE WE WE WE IN THIS LEGISLATURE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY. TO BE ABLE TO ACT IN AS IT'S BEEN SAID. AT A COST OF INACTION IS GREATER. THAN THAT THAN ACTING AND WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US TODAY IF ANY ONE OF US WERE TO A CRAFT A BILL THAT WOULD LOOK DIFFERENTLY THAN THE ONE BEFORE US. BUT THIS WASN'T DONE BY ANY ONE OF US IT WAS DONE BY ALL OF US WHO WERE WILLING TO ENGAGE. I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR I WANT TO THANK US SENATOR ERTZBERG ARCTIC SENATOR DODD I WANT TO THANK A VICE CHAIR MORE LOCK FOR THE TIME THAT WE SPENT. ON THIS I KNOW THAT -- SWIMMER HOLDEN AND A SOME OF OUR BURKE WE SPENT WAY TOO MUCH TIME TOGETHER OVER THIS -- AND ALSO I A LOT OF PRAISE NEEDS TO GO OUT TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF FOR THE WORK THAT THEY HAVE DONE THEY'VE LISTENED TO ALL OF US AND THEY PRESENTED US WITH A FRAMEWORK. FOR THIS LEGISLATURE TO BE ACT ON FOR THOSE WHO SPOKE UP BUT TODAY AND SAID THAT THEY WERE NOT I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY BECAUSE THERE WAS A THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT IT THAT WASN'T RIGHT IT WAS A MISSED OPPORTUNITY OR MAYBE. THERE'S A CALM ON THE WRONG PLACE OR PERIOD IN THE WRONG PLACE OR OR MAYBE THEY JUST DON'T TRUST THE ADMINISTRATION EITHER SOMETHING IN HERE BECAUSE IT IS -- VOLUMINOUS AND THEY THEY'RE SCARED THERE'S SOMETHING IN HERE THAT COULD CAUSE THEM SOME POLITICAL TROUBLE I WOULD ASK YOU A TODAY. TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT BY THIS MEASURE I DO BELIEVE THAT -- THAT THIS IF WE DON'T FIX THIS PROBLEM IT COULD BE AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO CALIFORNIA. TODAY IT IS OUR TURN TO ACT IT IS A RESPONSIBLE THING FOR BOTH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS TO BE ABLE TO STAND UP AND ACT ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA. AND SO I URGE AN AYE VOTE. I JUST WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR IS NOT JUST THE ONES THAT HAVE FOCUSED ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE BUT AS WELL SOME OF THE OTHERS SENATOR CENTER RUBIO FOR SOME OF YOUR CONCERNS AND INSURANCE -- STERN FOR THE TIME YOU SPEND AND LOOKING AT ALL THE ISSUES SURROUNDING ISSUES -- I ALSO WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO THE VICTIMS I THINK WE WE FAILED ON ON SOME LEVEL THIS TOOK TOO LONG. ON THIS AND ALL OF THAT PREVENTION AND MITIGATION ISSUES THAT WERE GOING INTO IN INSURANCE ISSUES THAT WERE TAKEN SO LONG TO ADDRESS AND I THINK THEY DESERVE AN APOLOGY. OF FOURTEEN HUNDRED DAYS OUTSIDE OF YOUR HOME IS WAY TOO LONG PEOPLE JUST WANT TO GO HOME. THEY WANT TO MOVE BACK TO WHERE THEY RAISE THEIR FAMILIES WE MET KIDS IN PARADISE. THAT WERE AFRAID THAT THEY WOULD NEVER GO HOME. SO FOR THEM I APOLOGIZE TO ALL THE VICTIMS THAT ARE HERE TODAY AND TO THOSE THAT ARE THAT ARE NOT HERE TODAY -- BUT I THINK THIS MEASURE DOES SHOW THAT WE DO CARE NOT JUST ABOUT REPAIRS BUT ABOUT VICTIMS. AND THE UTILITY STABILITY IS NOT JUST ABOUT A UTILITIES IT'S ABOUT CALPERS CAL STIRS. OTHER TEACHERS WHO HAVE INVESTED IN THESE UTILITIES IT'S EACH ONE OF US WHO ACTUALLY HAVE TO PROTECT THE INVESTMENT OF SO MANY OF THOSE A CALIFORNIANS THAT HAVE. INVESTED IN UTILITIES AND WHETHER THAT IS THERE ARE ENVIRONMENTAL MEASURES OR WHETHER THAT IS OUR ACTUAL PAYCHECKS. THAT WE HAVE PUT BEHIND SOME OF THESE I UTILITIES WE OWE THEM. TO STAND FIRM DISTINTA CATHER. AND WITH THAT I I RESPECTFULLY ARREST REQUEST AN AYE VOTE AND I APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUES I HAVE SPENT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TIME WITH MY ASSEMBLY MEMBER COLLEAGUES AND MY CENTER COLLEAGUES ON THIS. ON THIS ISSUE AND I THINK YOU FOR YOUR BOLDNESS THIS IS NOT EASY BUT IT'S GOOD AND I ALSO WANT TO THINK THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. ON IT'S BEEN A ROCK STAR AND LISTENING TO ALL OF US IS NOT ALWAYS EASY THERE'S A LOT OF VOICES WE ARE A MIXED BAG OF NUTS -- TO SAY IT MILDLY. SO TO COME LIKE WE'VE ALL SAID TODAY TO HAVE SO MUCH SUPPORT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO US I WANT TO THANK YOU TO LISTENING TO THE VICTIMS. AND LIKE I SAID I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST UNABLE. MISTER CHAIR I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU AND I'D LIKE TO THINK OF THIS COMMITTEE. FOR A DIGGING INTO THIS ISSUE AND ALLOWING US TO PRESENT THIS BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY. AS WAS OUTLINED -- THIS IS BEEN SORT OF A CONTINUATION. OF A PROCESS OF TRYING TO ENGAGE IN A VERY DIFFICULT SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES WE STARTED LAST YEAR WITH UTILITIES. SHOWING UP BASICALLY. A SAYING HOW THEY FELT UNDER SIEGE. THE POTENTIAL IMPACT AND THE FOCUS WAS ON DOING SOMETHING TO REVERSE OR TO MODIFY INVERSE CONDEMNATION. WE WENT THROUGH A PROCESS TO NINE A ONE LED BY. A GERMAN DODD AND I THINK WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES THAT SURROUND THIS I THINK WE RECOGNIZE LAST YEAR THAT WE NEEDED TO MOVE VERY AGGRESSIVELY AND WE DID. THIS ISSUE HAS. BEEN HANDLED AND OR OR DRESSED IN A VERY. PROACTIVE WAY UNDER. THE PREVIOUS GOVERNOR. JERRY BROWN. BOB. BUT NOW AFTER CAMPFIRE AND AND A LARGE UTILITY A BANKRUPTCY. WE START. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND WE ALL DIDN'T OR HOPING THAT. SB NINE NO ONE WOULD CARE IS A LITTLE FURTHER. BUT HERE WE ARE. AND AS IT WAS POINTED OUT EARLIER. WHEN YOU HAVE A UTILITY GO INTO BANKRUPTCY? IT'S DRAGON VICTIMS RIGHT ALONG WITH IT. AND SO WE DO FEEL. OUR HEARTS BREAK. AND THE BREAKING AGAIN TODAY. WHEN VICTIMS ARE REMINDING US OF THEIR PERSONAL PAIN? AND THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY'RE DEALING WITH ON A DAILY BASIS. SO THIS IS A A STRUCTURED APPROACH. THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS STEPPED OUT ON IT HAS SHOWN LEADERSHIP. ESPECIALLY WHEN NO REAL OPTION WAS APPARENT THAT WAS GOING TO BE PERFECT THAT WOULD MAKE EVERYBODY FEEL GOOD. THAT SOMEONE WAS GOING TO WALK AWAY FROM THIS PART OF THE PROCESS AND FEEL LIKE. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DID HERE SO YOU KNOW WHAT IT DIDN'T GO AS FAR AS WE NEEDED. TO YOU KNOW IT IT'S JUST NOT PERFECT ENOUGH [inaudible] I WAS. DRAGGING MY FEET AT FIRST. I WASN'T SURE THAT WE CAN REALLY GET THROUGH A PROCESS THAT WOULD BE TRANSPARENT. AND WOULD BE OPEN AND ENGAGING TO THE PUBLIC AND THEN BE ABLE TO HAVE SOMETHING. KEYED UP. NOT THERE YET BUT TEED UP. TO GET DONE. BY THE TWELFTH OF JULY BUT WE'RE ON PATH. AND I THINK THAT THERE'S YEAH BOTTOM LINE IS WE'RE TRYIG TO FIX A CALIFORNIA PROBLEM THESE UTILITIES. R. SO ENTER GO. TO THE OPERATION OF THE STATE AND OTHER BUSINESSES THAT ARE IMPACTED AS A RESULT OF IT. AND I JUST LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE. VERY CRITICAL IMPORTANT ELEMENTS THAT TIE INTRICATELY INTO THIS THAT ARE YET IN THE IN THE FOUR CORNERS OF THIS BILL. BUT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO LAYS OUT VERY CLEAR FORWARD THINKING IDEAS AND THAT'S IMPORTANT. AND I I CAN ONLY HOPE THAT YOU'LL STILL YOU STILL SEE FIT TO SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE OF THE UTILITIES ARE DESTABILIZED. AND THEY WERE IN THE NEXT TO GO IS SOUTHERN CALFORNIA EDISON JUST ON A DOWNGRADE THE IMPACT ON THE REPAIR COSTS IS GOING TO GO UP EVEN MORE. SO AS WE TRIED AT LEAST CALM THE WATERS. AND GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE CAN GET OUR ARMS AROUND AND AND SOONER THAN LATER. TO ADDRESS THE KIND OF DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCE ROLE THAT CAN BE PLAYED DOWN THE ROLE IT'S IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. BUT RIGHT NOW THE FOCUS OF THIS BILL IS TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE TAKE CARE OF AN INDUSTRY THAT RIGHT FRANKLY. WE'VE GOT ONE QUESTIONABLE PLAYER WHO'S IN BANKRUPTCY AND I HAVE NO HERE TO PULL OUT BUT THEY WOULD CAUSE ME TO PULL IT OUT IF I HAD IT. BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS COMMITTEE -- SUPPORTING THIS BILL I RESPECTFULLY ASK HER ABOUT. WE HAVE A MOTION -- CLERK PLEASE CALL THE ROLL [inaudible] MISS CLARK [inaudible] ONE AB TEN FIFTY FOUR DE PASO PROCREATION SENATOR WAS SO. WITH SO I MORE LOCK. BRADFORD. BRADFORD AYE KING. DODD.
