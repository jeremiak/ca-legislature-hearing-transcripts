EVERYONE WANTS TO DESTROY SAN

00:18:22.868 --> 00:18:24.837
FRANCISCO ON FILM. ARE WHAT WAS

00:18:24.903 --> 00:18:26.538
FRUSTRATING UNTIL A COUPLE YEARS

00:18:26.605 --> 00:18:27.973
AGO IS THAT WHILE THEY WERE

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.241
USING WONDERFUL COMPUTER

00:18:29.308 --> 00:18:30.809
GRAPHICS TO DESTROY OUR CITY

00:18:30.876 --> 00:18:31.944
THEY WERE ACTUALLY SHOOTING

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:33.479
PORTIONS OF THAT IN.

00:18:33.545 --> 00:18:36.281
PRIMARILY VANCOUVER OR LOUISIANA

00:18:36.348 --> 00:18:38.283
OR ANY OTHER PLACE THAT WOULD

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:38.951
HAVE A MORE LUCRATIVE TAX

00:18:39.017 --> 00:18:40.519
INCENTIVE.

00:18:40.586 --> 00:18:41.453
SO WHAT THEY WOULD DO IS THEY

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.688
COME TO OUR CITY FOR ABOUT TWO

00:18:42.754 --> 00:18:44.323

TWO DAY SHOOT PLATE SHOTS

00:18:47.092 --> 00:18:48.327
BACKGROUND SHOTS AND THEN THEY

00:18:48.393 --> 00:18:49.728
WOULD SHOOT THE REST OF IT

00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:50.262
SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR THE TAX

00:18:50.329 --> 00:18:51.296
INCENTIVES WERE BETTER.

00:18:51.363 --> 00:18:52.564
NOW IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS SINCE

00:18:52.631 --> 00:18:54.099

TO OUR AREA.

00:18:57.936 --> 00:18:59.304
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE

00:18:59.371 --> 00:19:00.973

00:39:00.337 --> 00:39:01.739
IS SO IMPORTANT.

00:39:01.806 --> 00:39:02.940
SEE IT'S NOT BAD ENOUGH THAT

00:39:03.007 --> 00:39:04.108
PARENTS HAVE TO SURF THE WAVES

00:39:04.175 --> 00:39:05.643
OF GRIEF FOR THE REST OF THEIR

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:07.712
LIVES MORNING A CHILD THAT THEY

00:39:07.778 --> 00:39:09.647
WILL NEVER GET TO WATCH GROW UP.

00:39:09.714 --> 00:39:10.781
THEY ALSO HAVE TO DEAL WITH

00:39:10.848 --> 00:39:12.450
UNEXPECTED EXPENSES THAT ADD

00:39:12.516 --> 00:39:13.851
INSULT TO INJURY.

00:39:13.918 --> 00:39:16.087
FUNERAL COSTS.

00:39:16.153 --> 00:39:18.556
BURIAL OR CREMATION COSTS.

00:39:18.622 --> 00:39:20.257
WORKING AFTER SOMETHING LIKE

00:39:20.324 --> 00:39:22.026
THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE SO THERE IS A

00:39:22.093 --> 00:39:24.195
LACK OF INCOME IN SOME CASES.

00:39:24.261 --> 00:39:25.763
SOME COUPLES NEED TO LEAVE THEIR

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:27.398
HOUSE OUR TOWN FOR A BIT IN

00:39:27.465 --> 00:39:28.532
ORDER TO COLLECT THEIR THOUGHTS

00:39:28.599 --> 00:39:30.101
AND BE ALONE.

00:39:30.167 --> 00:39:31.736
THERAPY IS ESSENTIAL WHEN IT

00:39:31.802 --> 00:39:33.437
COMES TO MANAGING NOT ONLY GRIEF

00:39:33.504 --> 00:39:35.673
BUT POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS

00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:37.775
AND IT IS OFTEN NOT COVERED BY

00:39:37.842 --> 00:39:39.977
INSURANCE AND FINALLY THE MOST

00:39:40.044 --> 00:39:42.246
ROBUST MEDICAL EXPENSES.

00:39:42.313 --> 00:39:43.748
TO PAY FOR THE BIRTH OF A BABY

00:39:43.814 --> 00:39:46.250
THAT YOU NOW HAVE TO BURY.

00:39:46.317 --> 00:39:47.685

00:39:51.021 --> 00:39:52.423
HAVE NOT.

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:54.291
THEIR MYSTERIOUS AND WHAT CAUSES

00:39:54.358 --> 00:39:55.359
THEM IS A NUMBER OF HIDDEN

00:39:55.426 --> 00:39:56.894
DANGERS.

00:39:56.961 --> 00:39:58.295

00:40:03.434 --> 00:40:04.869
IT'S FAR MORE COMMON THAN PEOPLE

REALIZE AND PARENTS OF THOSE

00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:08.305
TWENTY SIX THOUSAND BORN STILL

PEOPLE WE WERE ABLE TO HANDLE

00:40:13.511 --> 00:40:15.246
ALL THOSE EXPENSES BUT WE KNOW

00:40:15.312 --> 00:40:17.114
MANY PEOPLE WHO COULDN'T. AND

00:40:17.181 --> 00:40:18.482
HAD TO CHOOSE WHICH CRUCIAL

HEALING EXPERIENCE THEY WERE

00:40:23.087 --> 00:40:24.922

MISCARRIAGE OR STILLBIRTH. SO

00:40:32.696 --> 00:40:33.597
THAT THEY CAN STILL GET THE

00:40:33.664 --> 00:40:36.066
GRIEF THERAPY THAT SO HELPFUL.

00:40:36.133 --> 00:40:37.434
MANY PARENTS LIKE I SUFFER FROM

00:40:37.501 --> 00:40:39.570
PTSD AND OTHER FORMS OF PSYCHIC

00:40:39.637 --> 00:40:40.938
TRAUMA AND MOST INSURANCE

00:40:41.005 --> 00:40:42.072
COMPANIES DON'T COVER THE

00:40:42.139 --> 00:40:42.873
COUNSELING NEEDED TO HELP WITH

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:44.441

DEALING WITH THE LOSS OF A CHILD

00:40:55.452 --> 00:40:56.987
THE WAY THAT WE HAVE BEEN SO

00:40:57.054 --> 00:40:58.789
MANY OTHERS HAVE HAD TO DO. IS

00:40:58.856 --> 00:41:00.024
THE WORST THING A PERSON CAN GO

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:01.859

PEOPLE LIKE US KNOW THAT NOTHING

FOR INITIATIVE THAT LARGELY

00:54:48.618 --> 00:54:50.220
MIRRORS THIS AND WE RECENTLY MET

00:54:50.286 --> 00:54:53.623
WITH. OF THE ALEJO AND MANY

00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:55.425
THINGS WERE REVEALED IN THAT

00:54:55.492 --> 00:54:57.027

00:54:57.093 --> 00:54:58.695

00:55:04.601 --> 00:55:07.170
OR TEXT NONE OF THAT'S INCLUDED.

00:55:07.237 --> 00:55:08.705
THEY ADMIT THAT THERE'S BE A

00:55:08.772 --> 00:55:10.473
INCREASE IN THE DEMAND FOR

THEY KEEP TALKING TO THE CONSOLE

00:55:29.693 --> 00:55:31.194

00:55:52.115 --> 00:55:53.783
REPLACING THOSE WHO THAT WAS

00:55:59.589 --> 00:56:00.890

FOOTAGE HAVE YOU DONE AN

00:56:06.730 --> 00:56:09.299

BE. IN YOUR PURVIEW.

00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:11.434
BOB NO WE'VE NOT ESTIMATED THAT

00:56:11.501 --> 00:56:12.535
IF I COULD ADDRESS AT THAT WHEN

EACH OTHER AND SO YOU KNOW YOU

00:56:25.849 --> 00:56:27.050
COULD ABOUT EACH OTHER AND SO

00:56:27.117 --> 00:56:28.017
WHEN THEY WERE LOOKING AT SOME

00:56:28.084 --> 00:56:28.818
THE OTHER COUNTIES THEY WERE

00:56:28.885 --> 00:56:30.120
LOOKING AT FORGET EXACTLY WHICH

00:56:30.186 --> 00:56:31.654
ON A POLITICAL NAY NOW SAYS.

00:56:31.721 --> 00:56:32.489
THAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT LESS

00:56:32.555 --> 00:56:33.857
THAN TWO TENTHS OF A PERCENT

00:56:33.923 --> 00:56:35.191
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT THE

00:56:35.258 --> 00:56:37.193

THEN AFTER JOINING PROP NINETY.

00:56:40.396 --> 00:56:41.598
THAT THEIR ARGUMENT ORIGINALLY

00:56:41.664 --> 00:56:43.333
WAS THAT THEY WERE ESTIMATING

00:56:43.399 --> 00:56:44.467
THAT PEOPLE WOULD WANT TO MOVE

00:56:44.534 --> 00:56:46.402
TO DESTINATION CITIES AND LIVING

00:56:46.469 --> 00:56:47.904
IN SIN MEDINA COUNTY THEY WOULD

00:56:47.971 --> 00:56:49.172
SAY OKAY A. LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD

00:56:49.239 --> 00:56:50.740
WANT TO MOVE TO MAYBE RIVERSIDE

00:56:50.807 --> 00:56:52.008
COUNTY OUT TO PALM SPRINGS ARE

00:56:52.075 --> 00:56:53.309
MOVED TO ORANGE COUNTY INTO THE

00:56:53.376 --> 00:56:54.677
BEACH AREAS AND YOU WOULD HAVE

00:56:54.744 --> 00:56:55.745
CITIES THAT YOU WOULD HAVE

00:56:55.812 --> 00:56:57.013
PROPERTY TAXES MOVED INTO THOSE

00:56:57.080 --> 00:56:58.982
COMMUNITIES. THEY DO NOT FIND

00:56:59.048 --> 00:57:00.350
THAT TO BE TRUE OR ACCURATE SO I

00:57:00.416 --> 00:57:01.351

00:57:01.417 --> 00:57:02.552

HANDFUL OF THINGS IN THE BILL

01:05:52.148 --> 01:05:53.215
THAT I WANT TO FOCUS ON HERE MY

01:05:53.282 --> 01:05:54.383
TESTIMONY IN THE FIRST ONE IS

01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:56.152
THE HOMEOWNERS EXAM.

NINETEEN SEVENTY.

01:06:00.189 --> 01:06:02.258
CALIFORNIA IS FOURTEEN THINK

AN INCREASE IN THE HOMEOWNERS

01:06:12.735 --> 01:06:14.403
EXEMPTION WHICH RIGHT NOW IS

01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:16.005
JUST SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS.

01:06:16.072 --> 01:06:18.040
WOULD GO ON WAY TO MAKE HUNDRED

01:06:18.107 --> 01:06:20.443
SHIP. MORE AFFORDABLE FOR PEOPLE

01:06:20.509 --> 01:06:22.144
AND TO THE EXTENT THAT.

01:06:22.211 --> 01:06:24.046
AN INCREASE IN EXEMPTION MAKES

01:06:24.113 --> 01:06:25.448
OWNERSHIP HOMEOWNERSHIP MORE

01:06:25.514 --> 01:06:26.549
AFFORDABLE GOVERNMENT

01:06:26.615 --> 01:06:27.750
COMPLAINING PARTNER ROLE IN

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:30.519
INCREASING HOME CAPACITY.

01:06:30.586 --> 01:06:31.721
NUMBER TWO AN INCREASE IN THE

01:06:31.787 --> 01:06:33.189
RENTER'S CREDIT IS SOMETHING WE

01:06:33.255 --> 01:06:34.390
NEED HERE IN CALIFORNIA FOR THE

01:06:34.457 --> 01:06:36.525
SAME REASON ONE THIRD OF

ON RENT ONE THIRD.

01:06:41.997 --> 01:06:43.165
IT'S LITTLE WONDER THEN THAT

01:06:43.232 --> 01:06:44.734
CALIFORNIA HAS A TWENTY PERCENT

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:46.369
POVERTY RATE NUMBER ONE IN THE

01:06:46.435 --> 01:06:47.770
NATION AND IT'S ALSO LITTLE

01:06:47.837 --> 01:06:49.405
WONDER THAT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

01:06:49.472 --> 01:06:50.973
PEOPLE LEFT THE SAN FRANCISCO

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:54.076
BAY AREA. JUST LAST YEAR MAINLY

01:06:54.143 --> 01:06:54.610

01:06:54.677 --> 01:06:56.212
HOUSING.

01:06:56.278 --> 01:06:57.513
NUMBER THREE IS INCOME TAX

01:06:57.580 --> 01:07:00.149

HIGHEST INCOME TAX IN THE NATION

01:07:02.184 --> 01:07:03.686
AND IT'S THE MOST PROGRESSIVE

01:07:03.753 --> 01:07:05.221
TAX IN THE NATION ALSO WITH NINE

01:07:05.287 --> 01:07:07.223
SEPARATE BRACKETS.

01:07:07.289 --> 01:07:08.624
RETURNING MONEY INTO THE POCKETS

01:07:08.691 --> 01:07:10.393
OF MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES IS

01:07:10.459 --> 01:07:11.494
IMPERATIVE.

01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:13.429
MISTER FUNG MENTION THAT WE DO

01:07:13.496 --> 01:07:14.697
HAVE A SIX BILLION DOLLAR

01:07:14.764 --> 01:07:16.399
SURPLUS AND I THINK THAT EXACTLY

01:07:16.465 --> 01:07:18.033
HITS ON THIS POINT.

01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:19.869
WITH HOUSING ENERGY AND CONSUMER

01:07:19.935 --> 01:07:21.470
GOODS CONTINUING TO INCREASE WE

01:07:21.537 --> 01:07:23.005
DO NEED MORE DOLLARS PUT INTO

01:07:23.072 --> 01:07:24.206
THE POCKETS OF MIDDLE CLASS

01:07:24.273 --> 01:07:27.042
TAXPAYERS. AND THIS BILL WOULD

01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:28.577
DO THAT SO ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

01:07:28.644 --> 01:07:30.179

AND WORKING FAMILIES IN THE

01:07:43.993 --> 01:07:45.895
STATE. IT'S BEEN SAID BEFORE BUT

01:07:45.961 --> 01:07:47.329
IT'S WORTH REPEATING THAT SMALL

01:07:47.396 --> 01:07:48.864
BUSINESSES ARE THE ENGINE OF THE

01:07:48.931 --> 01:07:50.299
CALIFORNIA ECONOMY BUT NINETY

EMPLOYEES ARE EMPLOYED BY SMALL

01:07:55.671 --> 01:07:57.573
BUSINESSES AND HALF OF OUR GDP

01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:00.009
IS GENERATED BY SMALL BUSINESSES.

01:08:00.075 --> 01:08:01.544
BUT WE ALSO KNOW IS THAT THE

01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:02.344
SMALL BUSINESS CLIMATE IN

01:08:02.411 --> 01:08:03.946

01:08:09.652 --> 01:08:10.853
TARGETED TAX REFORM

OF OUR MEMBERS IN THIS IS COMMON

01:08:13.656 --> 01:08:15.391
FOR MANY SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS

01:08:15.458 --> 01:08:16.158
IN GENERAL.

01:08:16.225 --> 01:08:17.827
FILE A SOLE PROPRIETORS OF THE

01:08:17.893 --> 01:08:19.128
REDUCTION IN THE INDIVIDUAL TAX

01:08:19.195 --> 01:08:19.762

01:08:19.829 --> 01:08:21.664

SO WE THINK THAT TAX POLICY

01:08:35.678 --> 01:08:36.612
SHOULD BE A REFLECTION OF OUR

01:08:36.679 --> 01:08:38.247
PRIORITIES IN THE STATE. IF WE

01:08:38.314 --> 01:08:40.182

01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:20.956
THERE ARE THOSE ON THIS

01:09:21.023 --> 01:09:22.591
COMMITTEE WHO HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:23.425

CHICAGO LAW SCHOOL. OF FOR MORE

01:16:30.018 --> 01:16:31.987
THAN A CENTURY CONGRESS IN A

01:16:32.054 --> 01:16:33.655
REFLECTION OF FEDERALISM VALUES

01:16:33.722 --> 01:16:34.957
DEEPLY ROOTED IN THE AMERICAN

01:16:35.023 --> 01:16:36.758
POLITICAL TRADITION HAS ALLOWED

01:16:36.825 --> 01:16:38.894
TAXPAYERS TO DEDUCT FROM THEIR

01:16:38.961 --> 01:16:40.729
FEDERAL FEDERAL TAXES WHAT THEY

01:16:40.796 --> 01:16:42.864
PAY IN STATE AND LOCAL INCOME

01:16:42.931 --> 01:16:45.033
AND PROPERTY TAXES.

01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:46.668
IN DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN A

01:16:46.735 --> 01:16:48.170
NARROW MAJORITY OF CONGRESS

TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR CAP ON THE

01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:53.909
STATE AND LOCAL TAX DEDUCTION.

01:16:53.976 --> 01:16:55.210
AT THE SAME TIME CONGRESS

01:16:55.277 --> 01:16:57.646
ELIMINATED PERSONAL EXEMPTIONS

01:16:57.713 --> 01:16:58.981
AND DEDUCTIONS FOR DEPENDENTS

01:16:59.047 --> 01:17:00.549
AND REPLACE THEM WITH A LARGER

01:17:00.615 --> 01:17:02.551
STANDARD DEDUCTION WHICH HAD THE

01:17:02.617 --> 01:17:15.097
EFFECT OF REDUCING THE NUMBER AFTER TAX PRICE OF

01:17:15.163 --> 01:17:17.132
SATAN UP SERVICES AND RAISES THE

01:17:17.199 --> 01:17:18.934

01:17:20.802 --> 01:17:21.970
IN THE SHORT TERM WE EXPECT

01:17:22.037 --> 01:17:23.505
CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS TO

01:17:23.572 --> 01:17:25.574

THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS NEXT

01:17:30.579 --> 01:17:32.214
YEAR. AS A RESULT OF THIS

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:33.782
FEDERAL TAX CHANGE

01:17:33.849 --> 01:17:35.083
IN THE LONG TERM WE THINK IT

01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:36.618
WILL BE HARDER FOR STATES AND

01:17:36.685 --> 01:17:38.320
LOCALITIES TO RAISE REVENUE

01:17:38.387 --> 01:17:40.522
THROUGH TAXES.

01:17:40.589 --> 01:17:41.890
WHO LOSES FROM THEIR SWELLED

01:17:41.957 --> 01:17:44.092
STUDENTS FROM THE PRE QUE TO PHD

01:17:44.159 --> 01:17:45.927
LEVEL AT BECAUSE EDUCATION IS

01:17:45.994 --> 01:17:47.829
THE NUMBER ONE SPENDING ITEM FOR

01:17:47.896 --> 01:17:48.930
STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN

01:17:48.997 --> 01:17:50.165
THE NUMBER ONE DESTINATION OF

01:17:50.232 --> 01:17:51.600
CHARITABLE GIFTS?

01:17:51.666 --> 01:17:54.136
PATIENTS IN PUBLIC AND NONPROFIT

01:17:54.202 --> 01:17:55.604
HOSPITALS WHICH RELY ON STATE

01:17:55.670 --> 01:17:57.105
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT REVENUES

01:17:57.172 --> 01:17:58.874
AND CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS.

01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:00.142
AND FAMILIES THAT ARE RELIANT

01:18:00.208 --> 01:18:02.444
UPON SOCIAL SERVICES PROVIDED BY

01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:04.112
STATES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND

01:18:04.179 --> 01:18:06.848
BY NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS.

01:18:06.915 --> 01:18:08.283
WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT? THE BIDDY

01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:09.885
MASON GOLDEN STATE CREDIT

01:18:09.951 --> 01:18:11.653
PROGRAM IS AN INNOVATIVE WAY TO

01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:13.155
ENCOURAGE CALIFORNIANS TO

01:18:13.221 --> 01:18:14.656
SUPPORT STATE AND LOCAL

01:18:14.723 --> 01:18:15.757
INSTITUTIONS AND NONPROFIT

01:18:15.824 --> 01:18:18.460
ORGANIZATIONS AT THE SAME TIME.

01:18:18.527 --> 01:18:19.761
AND IT BUILDS OFF THE FACT THAT

01:18:19.828 --> 01:18:21.730
CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS REMAIN

01:18:21.797 --> 01:18:23.532
FULLY DEDUCTIBLE FOR HOUSEHOLDS

01:18:23.598 --> 01:18:25.300
THAT CONTINUE TO ITEMIZE BUT

01:18:25.367 --> 01:18:27.035
THAT RUN UP AGAINST THE TEN

01:18:27.102 --> 01:18:28.603
THOUSAND DOLLAR SALT CAP.

01:18:28.670 --> 01:18:29.805
IT ALSO TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE

01:18:29.871 --> 01:18:31.673
FACT THAT THE IRS IS TAKING THE

01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:32.974
POSITION BUT A CHARITABLE

01:18:33.041 --> 01:18:34.743
CONTRIBUTION IS DEDUCTIBLE AS A

01:18:34.810 --> 01:18:36.511
CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTION NOT

01:18:36.578 --> 01:18:37.813
WITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT A

01:18:37.879 --> 01:18:38.914
DONOR RECEIVES A STATE TAX

01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:40.982
CREDIT.

01:18:41.049 --> 01:18:42.651
SO HOW DOES IT WORK A IMAGINE A

01:18:42.717 --> 01:18:43.418
FAMILY IN THE TWENTY FOUR

01:18:43.485 --> 01:18:45.053
PERCENT BRACKET.

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:46.254
IT MAKES A HUNDRED DOLLAR

01:18:46.321 --> 01:18:48.123
CONTRIBUTION TO A QUALIFIED

01:18:48.190 --> 01:18:49.257
ENTITIES SUCH AS A PUBLIC

01:18:49.324 --> 01:18:50.759
UNIVERSITY OR A KEY TO TWELVE

01:18:50.826 --> 01:18:52.594
SCHOOL OR A PUBLIC CHARITY LIKE

01:18:52.661 --> 01:18:54.296
THE UNITED WAY.

01:18:54.362 --> 01:18:55.897
THE QUALIFY CHARITY WILL SAY THE

01:18:55.964 --> 01:18:57.599
UNITED WAY GIVES THE FAMILY A

01:18:57.666 --> 01:18:58.733
GOLDEN STATE CREDIT WORTH EIGHTY

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:00.502
DOLLARS.

01:19:00.569 --> 01:19:01.736
THE FAMILY IS ACTUALLY FOUR

01:19:01.803 --> 01:19:02.971
DOLLARS BETTER OFF AT THE END OF

01:19:03.038 --> 01:19:04.606
THE DAY BECAUSE IT GETS AN

01:19:04.673 --> 01:19:05.941
EIGHTY DOLLAR STATE TAX CREDIT

01:19:06.007 --> 01:19:07.275
AND A TWENTY FOUR DOLLAR FEDERAL

01:19:07.342 --> 01:19:08.844
DEDUCTION SO IT'S GIVING UP A

01:19:08.910 --> 01:19:10.779
HUNDRED DOLLARS AND GETTING A

01:19:10.846 --> 01:19:11.847
HUNDRED AND FOUR DOLLARS BACK IN.

01:19:11.913 --> 01:19:13.682
TAX BENEFITS.

01:19:13.748 --> 01:19:15.650
THE UNITED WAY TRANSFERS NINETY

01:19:15.717 --> 01:19:17.385
DOLLARS TO THE STATE IN EXCHANGE

01:19:17.452 --> 01:19:18.920
FOR THE CREDIT BUT IT STILL TEN

01:19:18.987 --> 01:19:21.022
DOLLARS BETTER OFF BECAUSE IT

01:19:21.089 --> 01:19:21.656
GETS A HUNDRED DOLLARS FROM THE

01:19:21.723 --> 01:19:22.958
FAMILY.

01:19:23.024 --> 01:19:24.426
AND THE STATE IS TEN DOLLARS

01:19:24.493 --> 01:19:26.528
BETTER OFF BECAUSE IT GOT NINETY

01:19:26.595 --> 01:19:28.130
DOLLARS FROM UNITED WAY AND GAVE

01:19:28.196 --> 01:19:30.765
A TAX CREDIT OF EIGHTY DOLLARS.

01:19:30.832 --> 01:19:32.100
SO THAT'S THE ATTRACTION OF THE

01:19:32.167 --> 01:19:33.702
BIDDING MASON GOLDEN STATE

01:19:33.768 --> 01:19:35.403
CREDIT PROGRAM AT THE NEW

01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:36.872
FEDERAL TAX LAW MAKES IT HARDER

01:19:36.938 --> 01:19:38.073
FOR CALIFORNIA TO RAISE REVENUE

01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:39.241
BUT THE BIDDING MASON GOLDEN

01:19:39.307 --> 01:19:40.709
STATE CREDIT PROGRAM GIVES THE

01:19:40.775 --> 01:19:42.244
STATE IN NEW REVENUE SOURCE.

01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:43.678
THE NEW FEDERAL TAX LAW MAKES IT

01:19:43.745 --> 01:19:45.313
HARDER FOR NONPROFITS TO ATTRACT

01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:47.149
CHARTABLE CONTRIBUTIONS BUT

01:19:47.215 --> 01:19:48.817
THIS PROGRAM HELPS THEM OUT. AND

01:19:48.884 --> 01:19:50.385
THE NEW FEDERAL TAX LAW DEALS A

01:19:50.452 --> 01:19:52.087
BLOW TO CALIFORNIA FAMILIES THAT

01:19:52.154 --> 01:19:53.989
RELIED ON THE SALT DEDUCTION BUT

01:19:54.055 --> 01:19:55.790
THE PD STATE GOLDEN STATE AT THE

01:19:55.857 --> 01:19:56.758
BIDDING MASON GOLDEN STATE

01:19:56.825 --> 01:20:01.863
CREDIT PROGRAM PROVIDES THOSE

01:20:01.930 --> 01:20:02.330
FAMILIES WITH RELIEF.

01:20:02.397 --> 01:20:02.998
LASTLY I JUST WANTED TO TAKE THE

01:20:03.064 --> 01:20:03.565
CHAIRWOMAN FOR PUTTING THIS

01:20:03.632 --> 01:20:04.199
PROPOSAL FORWARD I THINK IT CAN

01:20:04.266 --> 01:20:05.600
AND WILL BE A MODEL FOR HER THE

01:20:05.667 --> 01:20:07.202
OTHER STATES.

01:20:07.269 --> 01:20:07.936
IN ADDITION WOODS

01:20:08.003 --> 01:20:09.905
SUPPORT.

01:20:09.971 --> 01:20:11.973
AND OF.

01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:13.475
I'LL JUST BOMB BRIEFLY I'M

01:20:13.542 --> 01:20:14.976
ADDRESS SOME OF THE FEDERAL TAX

01:20:15.043 --> 01:20:16.611
LAW ISSUES INVOLVING THIS

01:20:16.678 --> 01:20:18.413
PROGRAM SO.

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:19.781
HOW ONE STOP EMPHASIZING THAT

01:20:19.848 --> 01:20:21.149
THIS LAWS GROUNDED IN THE SAME

01:20:21.216 --> 01:20:22.417
TAX LAW PRINCIPLES THAT

01:20:22.484 --> 01:20:24.252
UNDERSCORE THE HUNDRED PROGRAMS

01:20:24.319 --> 01:20:25.620
AND THIRTY OTHER STATES THAT PRE

01:20:25.687 --> 01:20:27.956
EXISTED? DID CHANGES MADE IN TWO

01:20:28.023 --> 01:20:29.324
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND IN

01:20:29.391 --> 01:20:30.592
PARTICULAR THE PRINCIPLE AS

01:20:30.659 --> 01:20:33.762
DANIEL'S SAID IS THAT.

01:20:33.828 --> 01:20:36.698
FEDERAL TAX LAW DOES NOT LOOK AT

01:20:36.765 --> 01:20:39.901
HOW THE STATE. DOES NOT EVALUATE.

01:20:39.968 --> 01:20:41.336
A CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTION AT THE

01:20:41.403 --> 01:20:42.437
FEDERAL LEVEL BASED ON WHAT

01:20:42.504 --> 01:20:44.072
HAPPENS AT THE STATE LEVEL

01:20:44.139 --> 01:20:45.607
THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE PRINCIPAL

01:20:45.674 --> 01:20:47.108
AND THAT IS HOW I ON THE OTHER

01:20:47.175 --> 01:20:49.411
PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN EVALUATED.

01:20:49.477 --> 01:20:51.546
AND IT IS ALSO THE PRINCIPLE

01:20:51.613 --> 01:20:53.081
WHICH UNDERSCORES S. B. TWO TWO

01:20:53.148 --> 01:20:55.317
SEVEN. FROM THE SENATE AS WELL

01:20:55.383 --> 01:20:56.985
AS BILLS HAVE BEEN PASSED IN NEW

01:20:57.052 --> 01:20:58.353
YORK AND NEW JERSEY.

01:20:58.420 --> 01:21:01.690
I'LL ALREADY SO THE QUESTION IS.

01:21:01.756 --> 01:21:03.592
BOB. HOW SHOULD WE THINK ABOUT

01:21:03.658 --> 01:21:04.993
THIS BILL IN WHICH A IN RELATION

01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:06.294
TO THOSE PRINCIPLES AND RELATED

01:21:06.361 --> 01:21:07.829
TO THOSE OTHER BILLS?

01:21:07.896 --> 01:21:08.730
I IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE IS

01:21:08.797 --> 01:21:10.265
THAT.

01:21:10.332 --> 01:21:12.234
THIS IS THAT ALL OF THESE BILLS

01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:13.034
ARE GROUNDED IN THE SAME

01:21:13.101 --> 01:21:14.703
PRINCIPLES AND THEY SHOULD ALL

01:21:14.769 --> 01:21:16.204
BE SUPPORTED ON THE HOW ARE THEY

01:21:16.271 --> 01:21:18.640
SHOULD ALL ON.

01:21:18.707 --> 01:21:20.075
NOT BE CHALLENGED.

01:21:20.141 --> 01:21:22.677
BY THE IRS ON THE OTHER HAND

01:21:22.744 --> 01:21:24.746
IT'S NOT IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE ON

01:21:24.813 --> 01:21:26.114
THAT THEY MIGHT BE ON IN

01:21:26.181 --> 01:21:27.482
PARTICULAR COMMENTATORS HAVE

01:21:27.549 --> 01:21:29.451
SUGGESTED THAT THERE COULD BE A

01:21:29.517 --> 01:21:31.019
DISTINCTION MADE BETWEEN. THE

01:21:31.086 --> 01:21:32.587
PRE EXISTING PROGRAMS AND THESE

01:21:32.654 --> 01:21:34.923
NEW PROGRAMS BASED ON WHICH

01:21:34.990 --> 01:21:36.591
ENTITIES RECEIVE BENEFIT AND IN

01:21:36.658 --> 01:21:37.759
PARTICULAR WHETHER OR NOT THE

01:21:37.826 --> 01:21:39.561
ENTITY IS A GOVERNMENT OR SOME

01:21:39.628 --> 01:21:41.696
OTHER KIND OF NONPROFIT ENTITY

01:21:41.763 --> 01:21:43.465
OR AT LEAST NOT THE SAME AT.

01:21:43.531 --> 01:21:45.066
GOVERNMENT ENTITY. ACTUALLY

01:21:45.133 --> 01:21:46.635
GIVING OUT THE TAX CREDIT.

01:21:46.701 --> 01:21:48.470
NOW. ONE EMPHASIZE THAT THAT

01:21:48.536 --> 01:21:50.005
DISTINCTION ITSELF WOULD BE AD

01:21:50.071 --> 01:21:52.841
HOC AND NOT GROUNDED IN IN THE

01:21:52.907 --> 01:21:54.943
LAW WOULD ULTIMATELY. FELL I

01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:57.979
BELIEVE NEVERTHELESS IT IS.

01:21:58.046 --> 01:22:00.215
A PROPOSAL THAT IS OUT THERE AND

01:22:00.282 --> 01:22:01.182
ONE OF THE.

01:22:01.249 --> 01:22:03.518
REALLY APPEALING FEATURES OF AB

01:22:03.585 --> 01:22:04.853
TWO TWO ONE SEVEN IS THAT IT

01:22:04.919 --> 01:22:06.288
SIMULTANEOUSLY DOES SOMETHING

01:22:06.354 --> 01:22:07.722
EXTREMELY DESIRABLE FROM A

01:22:07.789 --> 01:22:09.891
POLICY PERSPECTIVE. NAMELY

01:22:09.958 --> 01:22:11.693
BROADEN THE TAX BENEFIT TO A

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:14.229
LARGER SWATH OF CIVIL SOCIETY.

01:22:14.296 --> 01:22:15.664
AND AT THE SAME TIME AS IT'S

01:22:15.730 --> 01:22:16.898
DOING SOMETHING THAT MAKES A LOT

01:22:16.965 --> 01:22:18.466
OF SENSE BEEN UPON POLICY

01:22:18.533 --> 01:22:20.435
GROUNDS. IT WILL ALSO BE MORE

01:22:20.502 --> 01:22:22.637
ROBUST RELATIVE TO ONE

01:22:22.704 --> 01:22:24.773
PARTICULAR KIND OF CHALLENGE.

01:22:24.839 --> 01:22:27.442
THAT IS POSSIBLE ON THAT THE IRS

01:22:27.509 --> 01:22:29.944
MIGHT HARM LEVY AGAINST THESE

01:22:30.011 --> 01:22:31.346
OTHER KINDS OF PROGRAMS PASSED

01:22:31.413 --> 01:22:35.250
BY OTHER STATE.

01:22:35.317 --> 01:22:37.719
THE COURTS QUORUM.
