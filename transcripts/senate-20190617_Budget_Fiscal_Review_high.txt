NUMBER. BY KASKI. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A QUORUM HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED COLLEAGUES I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT TODAY'S HEARING WAS SCHEDULED RATHER LAST MINUTE IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW. THAT -- THE THE PRIMARY COMPONENT TO THIS BILL WERE PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET IN ADDITION THE MAJORITY THE LANGUAGE BEFORE US TODAY HAS BEEN POSTED. ON THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES WEBSITE FOR MONTHS IN THESE ISSUES WERE DISCUSSED. IN TE SUB COMMITTEE APPROXIMATELY TWO MONTHS AGO WITH THAT WE'RE GONNA OPEN UP FOR THE MANY STATE ADMINISTRATION TO PRESENT GOOD MORNING GOOD AFTERNOON AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I'M HERE WITH MY COLLEAGUES TO CHAMBER ONE WHO'S THE HEAD OF OUR REVENUE DEPARTMENT. AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I WILL MAKE A COUPLE OF BRIEF. COMMENTS ABOUT THE BILL BEFORE YOU AND THAT WE ARE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THE FIRST QUESTION THAT I WANT TO ANSWER IS WHY PASS A CONFORMITY BILL AT ALL. AND THEY'RE BASICALLY THREE REASONS FOR THIS THE FIRST IS SIMPLICITY -- IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO DO YOUR TAXES AND IT BECOMES ESPECIALLY HARD WHEN YOU'RE CALCULATING YOUR INCOME OR DEDUCTIONS ONE WAY FOR FEDERAL TAX PURPOSES AND ANOTHER WAY FOR STATE TAX PURPOSES. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN HAVE ONE SET OF RULES RATHER THAN TWO IT MAKES SENSE TO CONSIDER SOME OF THOSE CHANGES AND THOSE ARE THE CHANGES BEFORE YOU. THE SECOND REASON IS FOR CLARITY OFTEN WHEN PEOPLE ARE FILLING OUT THEIR TAXES AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT SETS OF RULES THAT MAY MAKE ERRORS THOSE ERRORS ARE COSTLY THEY TAKE TIME TO RECTIFY OFTEN THE RESULT IN PENALTIES FROM STATE OR FEDERAL TAX AGENCIES. SO WHEN YOU CONFORM WITH THE FEDERAL TAX CODE ON CERTAIN PROVISIONS IT REDUCES THE PROBABILITY OF THOSE TYPES OF ERRORS. AND THEN THE THIRD REASON IS POLICY -- MAKING CONFIRM THE CHANGES THAT ARE PRUDENT OR LOGICAL WE DON'T GENERALLY REVISIT OUR TAX CODE EVERY YEAR BUT EVERY COUPLE OF YEARS INCLUDING WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MAKE SOME CHANGES. THAT IS OFTEN THE TIME FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR TO LOOK AT THE TAX CODE AND CLOSE ANY LOOPHOLES MAKE ANY CHANGES TO PROTECT INDIVIDUALS AND SMALL BUSINESSES. ARE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND WE BELIEVE THE BILL BEFORE YOU DOES ALL THESE THINGS. INCLUDING AN EXPANSION OF THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT WHICH WE THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT PARTICULARLY FOR WORKING FAMILIES LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA. SO WHAT WE'LL DO NOW IS -- BRIEFLY WALK THROUGH SOME OF THESE ITEMS -- AND HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT ON THEM -- THAT'S ALL SEPARATE THEM INTO TWO CATEGORIES THERE THOSE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL THAT INCREASE REVENUE FOR THE STATE ON NET. AND THOSE PROVISIONS THAT DECREASE REVENUE BUT ARE NONE THE LESS GOOD PUBLIC POLICY. TO THE PROVISIONS THAT INCREASE REVENUE ARE LIMITING THAT BUSINESS LOSSES THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN TAKE TO OFFSET THEIR OTHER INCOME I SEE NOTING A PORTENT FACT ABOUT THIS PROVISION. IT ONLY LIMITS BUSINESS LOSSES IN EXCESS OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR MARRIED COUPLES SO THIS ONLY IMPACTS YOU IF YOU HAVE OVER HALF A MILLION DOLLARS OF WAGES OR OTHER CAPITAL INCOME MORE INTERESTING COMES TO OFFSET WITH ANY BUSINESS LOSSES. WE ALSO APPLY THE SAME FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR -- CAP FOR MARRIED COUPLES TO OUR LIMITS TO LIKE KIND EXCHANGES AGAIN HERE CONFORMING WITH FEDERAL LAW THIS IS A PROVISION WHEN PEOPLE SELL A PRODUCTIVE ASSETS. AND PURCHASE ANOTHER ASSET THERE OFTEN ABLE TO DEFER TAXES RATHER THAN PAYING TAXES ON THAT GAME -- WE PROPOSE CONFORMING TO THE FEDERAL PROBATION AND NOT ALLOWING THAT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF REAL PROPERTY -- IF YOU HAVE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE IN INCOME. WE ALSO ELIMINATE THE USE OF NET OPERATING LOSS CARRY BACKS WE ENSURE THAT BANK BIG BANKS THAT ARE PAYING PREMIUMS FOR THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION FDIC. IF THEY HAVE MORE THAN FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS IN ASSETS THEY SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DEDUCT THOSE PREMIUMS AND NOT PAY TAXES ON THOSE PAYMENTS WE CLOSE THE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION WILL POLL WHICH PREVIOUSLY ALLOWED. COMPANIES THAT PAY THEIR CEOS IN EXCESS OF A MILLION DOLLARS TO DEDUCT THAT COMPENSATION BY STYLING IT AS A BONUS OR OTHER PERFORMANCE BASED COMPENSATION. AND WE CONFORM TO SOME NEW FEDERAL RULES AROUND THE TECHNICAL TERMINATION OF PARTNERSHIPS AND SECTION THREE THIRTY EIGHT ELECTIONS WHICH ARE OFTEN USED FOR MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS IN THAT CASE ALSO MAKING SURE THAT. YOU CHOOSE THE SAME ELECTION FOR STATE AND FEDERAL LAW. SO THOSE ARE THE PROVISIONS GAIN REVENUE LET ME BRIEFLY MENTION THREE OF THE PROVISIONS THAT LOSE REVENUE BUT ARE GOOD PUBLIC POLICY -- ONE OF WHICH I'LL LET MY COLLEAGUE GERRY TALK ABOUT IN DETAIL. THE FIRST IS LISTENING SOME RESTRICTIONS ON THE CONTRIBUTIONS INTO ABLE ACCOUNTS SOME F YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THESE ACCOUNTS IT STANDS FOR ACHIEVING A BETTER LIFE EXPERIENCE. IS TO HELP PEOPLE AND FAMILIES WHO HAVE SOMEONE WITH A DISABILITY PAY FOR NECESSARY EXPENSES TO THE FEDERAL TAX REFORM LAW MADE SOME GOOD CHANGES IN THIS AREA AND WE'RE PROPOSING CONFORMING TO THEM. THE SECOND IS AROUND STUDENT LOANS -- OFTENTIMES WHEN THAT PERSON WITH THE STUDENT LOAN HAS A PERMANENT DISABILITY OR IF YOU'RE SHE PASSES AWAY -- THAT STUDENT LOAN CAN STILL BE PART OF THEIR IS STATE OR PART OF THEIR OBLIGATION SO HERE WE CONFORM TO SOME CHANGES IN FEDERAL LAW MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT BEARING THAT BIRD AND WHEN THEY ALREADY HAVE A DISABILITY OR IF THEY HAVE PASSED AWAY. AND THIRD -- AND CERTAINLY NOT LEAST SOME REALLY IMPORTANT PROVISIONS AROUND PROTECTING SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND MAKING LIFE EASIER FOR THEM SO I WILL LET MY COLLEAGUE JAY BRIEFLY TALK ABOUT THAT. GOOD AFTERNOON G. CHAMBERLAIN -- SO -- SMALL BUSINESSES AS AS YOUR WHERE CAN STRUGGLE KEEPING UP WITH PAPERWORK BURDENS THEY DON'T HAVE THE SCALE THE LARGE CORPORATION WOULD HAVE TO HAVE AN ENTIRE DEPARTMENT OR EVEN A SINGLE PERSON DEDICATED. TO KEEPING UP WITH THE PAPERWORK ISSUES SO IF WE DON'T ADOPT CONFORMITY ON ON THIS ITEM WE ARE GOING TO BE REQUIRED SMALL BUSINESSES. AND FRANCHISE TAX BOARD IS ESTIMATED SYSTEM THIS IS A ROUGH OVER THERE AND CREATED A BUT THE BEST WAY TO THERE'S ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESSES THAT WOULD BE AFFECTED BY THIS CONFORMITY ITEM -- WE'LL BE REQUIRED THEM TO KEEP TWO SETS OF BOOKS ONE FOR FEDERAL TAXES AND ONE FOR STATE. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE BOOKS THAT THEY KEEP FOR THE STATE ARE GOING TO BE MORE COMPLICATED TO THEY'LL BE DOING ONE SET OF BOOKS FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FAIRLY SIMPLE STRAIGHTFORWARD AND THEN OFF TO A COMPLICATED. SET OF CALCULATIONS TO DO THEIR ATTACKS FOR CALIFORNIA. SO DOES GIVE YOU A COUPLE EXAMPLES OF THE ACCOUNTING BURDENS THAT WILL THAT WOULD BE EATING EAST BY CONFORMITY. SO FIRST OF ALL -- WHAT THIS WOULD DO AND AND WHAT IT DOESN'T GENERALLY IS IT RAISES THE THRESHOLD? FOR HOW MUCH GROCERY C. TO COMPANY CAN HAVE BEFORE IT HAS -- TO HAS TO USE MORE COMPLICATED RULES GENERALLY THE RULE RIGHT NOW IS FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF GROSS RECEIPTS -- AND THIS THIS CONFORMITY WOULD RAISE THAT THRESHOLD TO TWENTY FIVE A TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF COURSE YOUR SEATS -- SO RIGHT NOW OUR SMALL BUSINESS HAS HAS TO FIND WITH WITH FIVE MILLION DOLLARS GROSS RECEIPTS IS ALLOWED TO USE CASH ACCOUNTING. TO IS FORCED WHEN IT COMES TO ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME AND EXPENSES RATHER THAN HAVE TO LOOK AT COMPLICATED A CRUEL RULES. THEY CAN SIMPLY A CREW THE EXPENSES AND THE INCOME OR ARE THEY ARE COUNTY. EXPENSES IN THE INCOME WHEN THEY ACTUALLY OCCUR AND NOT WORRY ABOUT. YOU WOULD WAS SUBSTANTIALLY ALL MOST WORK COMPLETED IN AND IT IS A INCOME RELY -- LIKELY TO COME ALL THOSE THIS IS A VERY CRUEL RULES -- SO AND IN ADDITION OF IN ADDITION TO A CRUEL VERSUS CASH ACCOUNTING -- THERE'S THE HOW DO THE WAY THE YOU CALCULATE COST COULD SOLD -- RIGHT NOW YOU WHEN YOU -- MOST MOST BUSINESSES OR LARGE BUSINESSES HAVE TO COUNT FOR COSTS COULD SOLD. BY LOOKING AT WHAT THEY ACTUALLY PURCHASED AND THEN COMPARING THE BEGINNING AND ENDING VALUE OF THEIR OF THEIR INVENTORY NOW. TOM HOW YOU ACTUALLY DO THAT HOW YOU ACTED TO COUNT FOR THE VALUE OF YOUR INVENTORY CAN BE SO WHAT THIS DOES IS IT SIMPLY SAYS FOR FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. WHICH AGAIN WOULD BE BUSINESS WITH -- INCOME UP TO TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS YOU SIMPLY HAVE TO LOOK WHICH PURCHASES ARE. AND THEIR OTHER THING SEARCHES ALL HOW YOU TREAT LONG TERM CONTRACTS AND HOW YOU CAPITALIZE. YOU'RE THE THE COST INCLUDED IN IN IN PRODUCING PRODUCTS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SELL SO IN ALL THEIR IN THERE ARE -- THERE ARE FIVE DIFFERENT RULES OF THIS AFFECTS. THAT WILL MAKE -- MAKE BOOKKEEPING A LOT EASIER FOR SMALL TEXTURES IN ADDITION IT TENDS TO LOWER THE TAX LIABILITY WHICH IS WHY -- THIS IS COURT AS AS A REVENUE LOSS IT DID. YEAH FIVE THAT'S GREAT AND AND WE KNOW THAT A THE REASON THE BUDGET YEAR THESE PROVISIONS THAT MY COLLEAGUES SPEAKING ABOUT WILL SCORE REVENUE LOSS OF TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS SO IT'S CERTAINLY NOT CHEAP BUT WE BELIEVE AS PART OF THIS CONFORMITY PACKAGE. IN MAKES A LOT OF SENSE -- FOR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND PEOPLE WHO WORK IN SMALL BUSINESSES. I'LL COVE ONE LAST POINT -- WHICH IS A QUESTION THAT WE SOMETIMES RECEIVE WHICH IS -- THE ADMINISTRATION HAS SAID AND WE'VE HEARD FROM A NUMBER OF FOLKS THIS FEDERAL TAX BUILDER A LOT OF THINGS IN IT THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE. SO WHY CONFORM TO DISPEL IN PARTICULAR AND OUR ANSWER TO THAT IS TWO FOLD THE FIRST IS THAT THIS IS NOT A FULL CONFORMITY WITH ALL THE PROVISIONS WERE ONLY CONFORMING TO THOSE PROVISIONS. THAT MAKES THESE SO FOR EXAMPLE AS ALL OF YOU KNOW FOR THE FEDERAL TAX BILL HAD A CAP ON THE STATE AND LOCAL TAX DEDUCTION WE'RE CERTAINLY NOT DOING IN THIS CONFORMITY PACKAGE ANYTHING RELATED TO THAT IN TERMS OF THE DEDUCTIBILITY. OF LOCAL TAXES BUT WHEN IT COMES TO CLOSING LOOPHOLES THAT ALLOW PEOPLE TO USE BUSINESS LOSSES TO OFFSET KNOWING THAT DOLLARS IN INCOME AND IN SOME CASES NOT PAY ANY TAXES AT ALL WHERE AS YOU AND I ARE PAYING TAXES ON OUR WAGES. THAT'S A LOOPHOLE THAT WE FEEL COMFORTABLE CLOSING AND CONFORMING WITH THE FEDERAL ACTION. AND THEN THE SECOND IS THE USE OF THE REVENUE AND GET THE FEDERAL TAX -- LEVEL THEY CLOSED SOME THESE WILL POLLS BUT USE THE REVENUE FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSES HERE WERE PROPOSING SPECIFICALLY TO PUT THE REVENUE INTO THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT WHICH HELPS FAMILIES ALL OF WHOM HAVE SOMEONE WHO WORKS. ALL OF WHOM ARE IN INCOME UNDER THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND TO THE EXTENT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO BE VERY CAREFUL WITH OUR ESTIMATES. TO THE EXTENT THERE IS ANY ACCESS REVENUE AFTER WE FIND OUR EITC THAT WILL HELP OUR SCHOOLS UNDER PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT AND ALSO HELPS THEM REST OF THE BUNCH ARCHITECTURE AND BILL BUDGET RESILIENCY. SO THAT'S THE GENERAL PACKAGE AND HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WITH THAT MEMBERS. MISTER MOORE Là FOLLOWED BY -- SENATOR OFF CENTER MORE LOT THANK YOU MANAGER. I'M JUST CURIOUS HOW MUCH WE SPENDING CURRENTLY EACH YEAR ON THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. SO IN THE CURRENT TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT IT'S ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND THEN. WE WANT TO SPEND THEN ONE POINT SIX TO TWO BILLION THEN SO UNDER AT THIS BILL WE WOULD ESTIMATE IT WOULD GO DAY TAX CREDIT EITC WOULD GO FROM FOUR HUNDRED MILLION TO ONE BILLION. SO BASICALLY BE A TWO AND A HALF TIMES INCREASE AND THEN YOU'RE. EXPECTING TO GET. A LOT MORE THAN ONE BILLION FROM THIS PARTICULAR. CALLER TRAILER BILL -- CURRENT ESTIMATE IS IN THE BUDGET YEAR ONE POINT SIX BILLION BUT SOME OF THAT HAS TO DO SIMPLY WITH THE TIMING OF THIS PACKAGE IN MY CALL I CAN. SPEAK ABOUT THAT OVER THE LONGER TERM WERE EXPECTING ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN ONGOING REVENUE. SO THEN WHY WASN'T SIX HUNDRED MILLION TO SET ASIDE AND THE BUDGET. WHY ARE WE DOING? A TAX INCREASE TO WE WE WE COULD HAVE PAID FOR IT RIGHT OUT OF THAT. TWENTY ONE AND A HALF BILLION I'M I I'M JUST CURIOUS. TO WE FELT MOST OF THAT TWENTY ONE AND A HALF BILLION IS ONE TIME AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE EITC -- THE T. C. THAT HAS BEEN AROUND AT THE STATE LEVEL FOR SEVERAL YEARS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL FOR SEVERAL DECADES. AND WE SEE THIS AS A PROGRAM THAT NOT ONLY IS IMPORTANT GENERALLY ON GOING BUT WHEN THERE IS. SOME TYPE OF FISCAL DISASTER OF AND THAT'S WHEN PEOPLE OFTEN ARE RELYING ON THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS EVEN MORE SO WE WANT TO PUT IT ON AS SOUND A PHYSICAL BASIS AS POSSIBLE. AND THEN LAST QUESTION THE PERSONAL LIKE KIND EXCHANGE RULES. WE'RE GETTING RID OF FOUGHT TO PUSH BACK FROM AUTO MAKERS. WHO WHAT SHOULD OUR RESPONSE BE? TO BASICALLY I THINK THERE ARE A COUPLE THINGS THAT YOU COULD SAY NUMBER ONE IS THAT. VERY BROADLY THIS IS THE SAME CHANGE THAT WE ARE SEEING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL SO WE'RE SIMPLY ADOPTING THEIR RULES AND FACTS ARE RULES ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE LOOK RELAXED AND THERE IS BECAUSE WE ARE SAYING. THIS ONLY APPLIES TO YOU IF YOU HAD IN COMMON OF HALF A MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE IF YOU'RE MARRIED WHEREAS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THERE IS NO LIMIT BUT EXCEPT WITH THE EXCEPTION FOR REAL PROPERTY WHICH WE ALSO ADOPT. SOMETHING THAT'S ONE THING YOU CAN SAY I THINK THE SECOND THING IS WE DON'T SEE THIS NECESSARILY HAVING A LARGE IMPACT ON THE LEASING OR VEHICLE MARKET AND MY COLLEAGUES HAPPY TO TALK. MORE ABOUT THAT. AND THEN I THINK THE THIRD IS THAT GENERALLY THE REASON THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ADOPTED THIS ROLE AND THE REASON THAT WE ARE ADOPTING A VERSION OF IT. IS WHEN YOU TO SELL A PRODUCTIVE ASSETS TAX SHOULD BE DUE ON IT SO WHEN YOU'RE NOT PAYING TAXES ON IT THOUGH THAT'S TAX REVENUE THAT SOMEBODY ELSE HAS TO PAY SO WE THINK. THIS IS REALLY THE FAIREST POLICY HERE I SHOULD ALSO NOTE SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO AUTO MAKERS THAT WE DISCUSSED OUR CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM LAST WEEK IN COMMITTEE. AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS TOTALING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO SUPPORT. THE INDUSTRY AND THE INTRODUCTION OF CLEAN VEHICLES IN PARTICULAR. THANK YOU THANK YOU MANAGER -- CETERA. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR WITH REGARD TO THAT YOU KNOW I'M NOT AN ACCOUNTANT. NORA MY TAX LAWYER. BUT SOMEONE ASSERTED WITH RESPECT TO THIS AUTO MOTOR VEHICLE LEASING SITUATION THAT. ON THE FEDERAL SIDE WITH THE THE REQUIREMENT THAT DEPRECIATION CAPITAL GAIN LOSS BE RECOGNIZED ON THE TRANSFER OF THE OF THE FORMALLY LIKE KIND S. SENATE. ON THE FEDERAL SIDE THERE'S NOW BEEN BUILT IN AND MEETING THE MEDIA EXPENSE PROVISION THAT ALLOWS. ON THE ACQUISITION OF THE NEW S. AT THAT THE VALUE BE IMMEDIATELY EXPRESSED I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE OR NOT BUT IF THAT'S TRUE. THEN THAT CREATES A LITTLE WE'VE WE'VE TAKEN ONE SIDE OF TAX CONFORMITY BUT NOT THE OTHER SIDE IS THAT TRUE. SO I CAN SPEAK REFER TO THAT AND JAY AT YOU CAN SO SO IT IS. THE CONFORMITY PACKAGE AS I MENTIONED IS A PARTIAL CONFORMITY PACKAGE SO WE'RE NOT CONFORMING TO EVERYTHING AND I THINK. SOME PEOPLE COULD LOOK AT OUR CONFORMITY PACKAGE AND SAY HEY YOU ARE TAKING THIS ITEM BUT NOT THAT ITEM AND THAT IS. BROADLY TRUE FOR EXAMPLE THAT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE LARGE -- PART OF THEIR TAX REFORM WAS A VERY BIG CORPORATE TAX CUTS AND YOU CAN SEE IN OUR PACKAGE WE DO NOT CAUGHT THE STATE CORPORATE TAX RATE. SO WHAT WE BASICALLY DECIDED THE ADMINISTRATION THE GOVERNOR IS THAT IT MAKES SENSE TO SAY THAT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF REAL PROPERTY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY DID AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. WHEN YOU SELL AN ASSET JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE BUYING ANOTHER? ONE YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DEFER YOUR TAXES ON THAT SALE AND OFTEN THERE IS A GAME HERE BECAUSE THAT ASSET EVEN THOUGH IT HAS SIGNIFICANT VALUE HAS BEEN DEPRECIATED A LOT. UNDER EXISTING RULES OFTENTIMES OR SOMETIMES DEPENDING ON THE INDUSTRY ALL THE WAY DOWN TO ZERO SO PEOPLE ARE DEPRECIATING OR EXPENSING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL -- THEY GET THE FULL DEDUCTION AND THEN WHEN THEY SELL THE ASSET THEY WANT THE SAME LIKE KIND EXCHANGE TREATMENT AT THE STATE LEVEL WE DON'T NECESSARILY THINK THAT MAKES SENSE THE WORKERS WERE ASSUMING THAT TRANSACTION IS AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL. AS OPPOSED TO FORD MOTOR CREDIT OR GM. CREDIT AND AND I DON'T PROFESS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THOSE ARRANGEMENTS WORK. BUT IF IN FACT YOU WILL YOU FORCED DEPRECIATION GAIN AND LOSS RECOGNITION. AND YOU DO NOT ALLOW ME X. EXPENSING OF THE OF THE NEWLY ACQUIRED A SAID I COULD SEE HOW THAT MIGHT FROM A NON TAX LAWYER NOT ACCOUNT STANDPOINT. DRIVE UP THE COST OF THE LEASE PACKAGE WHICH WOULD INTENT OF WHICH WOULD IN TURN. PERHAPS BE PASSED ON TO THE CONSUMER LISTEN I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY. MY CONCERN IS WITH THAT WAS WITH ITEM TEN ON ORIGINS A LIKE KIND EXCHANGE IS AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON OUR STATE. ELECTRIC VEHICLE PROGRAMS WHICH YOU KNOW AND MY COLLEAGUES KNOW WE'VE SPENT  AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME AND ATTENTION. ON SINCE I FIRST JOINED THIS HOUSE IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN SO. AS THIS BILL. PROBABLY MOVES OUT OF HERE AND MOVES ON AND AFTER I WOULD ASK THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WORK WITH THE GLOBAL AUTO MANUFACTURERS TO SEE IF WE CAN ADDRESS. ANY POTENTIAL ADVERSE IMPACT. ON OUR STATE ELECTRIC VEHICLE. LEASING PROGRAMS BECAUSE YOU'D IF THE PRICE OF A BOLT IS GOING TO GO FROM EIGHTY NINE DOLLARS A MONTH 220-023-0020 NINE DOLLARS A MONTH TO FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH. THAT MIGHT DRIVE DOWN. THE NUMBER OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES THAT WERE ACTUALLY ABLE TO ROLL OUT OUR ROADS WHICH WOULD. BE SORT OF COUNTER TO OUR STATE POLICIES HERE I'M NOT SAYING IT'S TRUE BUT I'M ASKING THE ADMINISTRATION TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT WITH THE OTTOMAN MANUFACTURES TO SEE IF IN FACT. THE FAILURE TO INCLUDE IMMEDIATE EXPENSING IF TRUE WILL HAVE HAS AN IMPACT ON THESE LEASE ARRANGEMENTS THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU SIR SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND NOW I'M ON MY FAMILY WERE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS -- I KNOW WHO. IT'S RIVER GOING THROUGH -- OUR TAXES AND TALKING TO THE WORKING WITH ACCOUNTANTS SO FORTH. SO -- AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER I JUST WANT TO ASK -- AND WE OFTEN TAUGHT IN ANYWAYS -- WHO WOULD BE ACCURATE TO SAY THAT TO MANY OF THE PROVISIONS HERE WOULD ACTUALLY SIMPLIFY -- OUR TAXES -- THAT WOULD REDUCE POTENTIALLY EVEN SOME PERHAPS I WANT MY ACCOUNT MAY NOT BE HAPPY-TO HEAR THIS BUT ACTUALLY REDUCE SO MY COUNTY COSTS WHEN I DO MY TAXES. WOULD THAT BE AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS -- AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER. YES I WOULD SAY IT REDUCES BOTH YOUR ACCOUNTING COSTS AND YOUR ACTUAL TAX LIABILITY IN MANY CASES AND SO BASICALLY THE PROVISIONS THAT MY COLLEAGUE WAS DISCUSSING. RIGHT NOW ARE AVAILABLE FOR YOUR SMALL BUSINESS IF YOU HAVE UP TO FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE AND THIS WOULD BASICALLY TAKE THAT TO TWENTY FIVE MILLION OF COURSE FIVE MILLION SOUNDS LIKE A LOT BUT YOU KNOW YOU COULD BE RUNNING WHATEVER SMALL BUT YOU COULD HAVE A NUMBER. OF EMPLOYEES YOU'RE STILL NOT A BIG CORPORATION YOU STILL DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THE BOOKKEEPING AND INTERNAL ONE AUDITING RESOURCES THAT THEY HAD. SO THIS WOULD REDUCE THAT BURDEN IN THE COST OF GOING THROUGH ALL OF IT AND THEY WOULD LIKELY PAY LESS IN TAXES AS WELL AS A RESULT OF MOVING FROM A CRUEL TO A CASH ACCOUNTING METHOD. OKAY SO I THINK THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT POINT THE OTHER THING IS I WOULD WELL CERTAINLY THAT PARTICULAR PROVISION FOR SMALL BUSINESSES WELL -- SAY SMALL BUSINESS MONEY AND ACTUALLY AND AND AND AND DOES DECREASE AS YOU MENTIONED SOME OF THE REVENUE COMES THE STATE EVEN THE PROVISIONS THAT INCREASED REVENUE TO THE STATE -- THE FACT THAT WE NOW ARE -- I GUESS IN LINE WITH SOME OF THE CHANGES AGAINST VERY SELECTIVELY IN LINE WITH FELT THAT WITH WOULDN'T THAT ALSO REDUCE SOME OF THE BURDENS ON BUSINESSES. AND REGARDS -- TO BOTH ACCOUNTING BOOKKEEPING AND AS WELL AS TO TAX FILINGS WOULD YOU WOULD YOU WOULD THAT BE AN ACTOR TO ASK. YES THAT'S CORRECT OKAY SO IT SO I THINK AGAIN SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND THAT YOU KNOW EVEN AS WE LOOK AT SOME OF THESE PROVISIONS WHICH ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN DECIDED BY OUR FEDERAL -- PARTNERS SOME OF WHICH WE MAY AGREE OR NOT HE BY MEANS THE PARTICULAR PROVISIONS WE'VE SELECTED -- ARE WOULD EACH OF THEM -- ACTUALLY HELP -- ACTUALLY DECREASE SOME OF THE BURDEN ON BUSINESSES WHO HAVE WHO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS PARTICULAR ISSUES IS THAT CORRECT YES THAT'S CORRECT ALL RIGHT WELL I THINK THAT'S A VERY POSITIVE THING HERE I KNOW. SOME PEOPLE ARE CHALLENGE WITH THE WORD CONFORMITY -- ANYTHING MORE ACTUALLY THIS IS -- PERHAPS -- BOTH TAX SIMPLIFICATION AS WELL AS SELECTIVE ALIGNMENT -- THAT -- MEETS OUR POLICY GOALS -- AND IS CERTAINLY YOU -- WITH HER SUPPORT FOR THIS PROVISION ALONG THOSE LINES THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND SENATOR PAN THAT'S WHY OUR AGENDA REFLECTS ITS CURRENT NAME WHICH IS THE LOOPHOLE CLOSURE AND SMALL BUSINESS AND WORKING FAMILIES TAX RELIEF ACT OF TWENTY NINETEEN CONFORM HE'S NOT REFERENCE IN THERE AT ALL I THINK FOR JUST THOSE REASONS. SENATOR NIELSEN. INDEED I CAN CONCUR WITH YOUR ASSESSMENT. SURE OF THE TITLE. BUT AS TO THE OVERALL DEAL. THIS ISN'T THROUGH EXPLICIT. CONFORMITY AND SELECT OR TARGETED CONFORMITY IS IT NOT. THAT'S CORRECT AND BASED ON THE RATIONALE IS THAT YOU'VE PRESENTED HERE [inaudible] GOING [inaudible] FORWARD. IN THE SOME OF THIS MONEY WILL BE INTO THE GENERAL FUND WILL BE SPENT ON WHATEVER. IN THE GENERAL FUND. LONG TERM SAY. TO BUDGET CYCLES. WILL THIS HAVE A PLUS -- A NEGATIVE IMPACT [inaudible] ON ONGOING EXPENDITURES THE BASE. THE BASE THE CALIFORNIA BASED TAX. WE GO UP DO WE GO DOWN WE STAY NEUTRAL. SO OUR BEST ESTIMATE RIGHT NOW IS IT WILL HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT OF A COUPLE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS BUT I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT THIS WOULD BE A NEW PROGRAM SET UP PROGRAMS -- SO WE'RE GOING TO BE WATCHING THE REVENUE ESTIMATES IF THIS PASSES VERY CLOSELY AND WE WILL UPDATE ACCORDINGLY [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] BROUGH. HI MOM IN GOING THROUGH THIS. AND YOU GAVE HER THINK YOU DID. GIVE SOME AMOUNT I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON REGULAR CALIFORNIANS OUT THERE LIKE -- AND THE MAYBE IT'S BY VIRTUE OF HOW MANY. HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD BE IMPACTED OR HOW MANY BUSINESSES WOULD BE IMPACTED BUT? WHAT DO THESE BIG NUMBERS TRANSLATE INTO? AS FAR AS THE NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS THAT YOU COULD BEST. ESTIMATE WOULD BE IMPACTED I'M I'M NOT ASKING NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE BUT WOULD BE IMPACTED BY IT SO IF YOU COULD GIVE SOME AMOUNT FOR THEM SO THAT -- EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT WHAT'S THE APPROXIMATE NUMBER. ALL AFFECTED BY EITC SO WE'RE EXPECTING IF THIS BILL WERE TO PASS THAT THE NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLDS RECEIVING THE EITC WOULD GO UP BY A MILLION SO CURRENTLY IT'S TWO MILLION AND WE'RE EXPECTING YOU WOULD GO TO THREE MILLION. SO FROM ONE TO THREE MILLION TWO MILLION TO THREE MILLION I'M SORRY TWO TO THREE MILLION. WOULD BE THE IMPACT -- AND SOME OF THE USER COULD BE REALLY TO BE IN A BETTER LIFE EXPERIENCE ACCOUNTS. SO I BELIEVE THAT IS AROUND ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL -- BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THESE ACCOUNTS ARE PRETTY NEW THEY WERE ONLY AUTHORIZED BY FEDERAL LEGISLATION A COUPLE YEARS AGO SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT COULD GROW OVER TIME OKAY. THE STUDENT LOAN DEBT. THAT IS ALSO. THAT'S ALSO IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S NEW YES. OKAY -- THE IF IDEA IF THE I SEE PREMIUMS SAID THAT WE WOULD HAVE THAT -- ABOUT SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF REVENUE GAINS. AND AGAIN THAT -- IT ONLY AFFECTS BANKS WITH MORE THAN TEN BILLION DOLLARS OF ASSETS SO ONLY LARGER BANKS. THIRTY DRAWS ON THE CLEAR FIGHT WAS YOUR QUESTION HOW MANY PEOPLE IMPACTED NOT THE PRICE TAG RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT OKAY SO -- THANK YOU YES SO ON ABLE AND STUDENT LOANS WE SHOULD GET THAT WILL HAVE TO CHECK I THINKRIGHT NOW THERE'S THERE'S A THOUSAND ABLE ACCOUNTS RIGHT NOW BUT THAT AS AS MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED THAT COULD BE GROWING. SO KINDLY BUT OKAY AS FAR AS THE THE STUDENT LOAN DEBT LOAN DEBT I DON'T HAVE ANY NUMBERS IT'S IT. CAN BE FAIRLY SMALL NUMBER -- BUT I DON'T HAVE. HAVE ANY DATA ON THAT AND THE PREMIUMS. WE HAVE TO LOOK UP THE NUMBER OF BANKS YEAH I I I RECALL NUMBER% ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED OR SO MIGHT BE AFFECTED BY THIS BUT BUT LET ME LET ME GET BACK TO ON OKAY -- EXCESS EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION. SO IS THAT FOR THE FOR THAT HOWEVER YOU MIGHT MEASURE IT I JUST WANT TO GET A YEAH FOR THE CEO COMPENSATION THIS IS BASICALLY THERE ARE DISCLOSURE RULES FOR PUBLIC COMPANIES THE GENERAL DISCLOSURE FIVE HIGHEST PAID OFFICERS. AND AMONG THE TWO HUNDRED HIGHEST PAID CEOS LAST YEAR AND THAT MEDIAN CEO RECEIVED EIGHTEEN POINT SIX MILLION. DOLLARS SO BASICALLY FOR THESE COMPANIES THAT PAY THEIR CO MORE THAN A MILLION DOLLARS THEY COULD CONTINUE TO DO THAT OF COURSE THEY WOULD JUST HAVE TO PAY TAXES -- AND NOT COUNT THAT AS A BUSINESS EXPENSE ABOUT THE MILLION DOLLARS BUT WE CAN FOLLOW UP ON THE EXACT NUMBER THAT WE ESTIMATE. OKAY -- THE IN A WELL THE KERRY BACKS. SO THAT MIGHT BE HARD TO ESTIMATE RIGHT IT WOULD BE. YEAH HI I FIVE DON'T HAVE THE DATE I THINK WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET THAT YEAH. OKAY -- AND YOU MENTIONED SMALL BUSINESSES THAT'S ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT'S A ROUGH ESTIMATE YEAH ABOUT. SIXTY THOUSAND NON CORPORATE BUSINESS LOS LIMITS. THERE BASED ON THE MOST RECENT DATA -- WE ARE ESTIMATING THAT THAT WILL AFFECT AROUND TEN OR ELEVEN THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS OKAY. TECHNICAL TERMINATION OF A PARTNERSHIP. HAVE. HELLO YOU HAVE NO IDEA. LIKE KIND EXCHANGE RULES THIS IS MORE THE INCIDENT DORADO I'M LOOKING HERE -- ARE -- BUT TO STAFF DIRECTOR HAS AGREED THAT I THINK CAST SOME OF THESE NUMBERS YOU'RE LOOKING FOR OKAY AND SO WE'LL SHARE IT WITH YOU AS WELL. FOR THOSE THAT DID THAT -- FINANCE DOESN'T HAVE THE ANSWER. TO OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU FOR THE TO SKINNER FOLLOWED BY SENATOR STONE. THANK YOU I JUST WANTED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF IF WE WERE. TO ENACT. MAKE OUR RULES. COMPARABLE TO ALL OF THE FEDERAL OR TRUMP TAX ADJUSTMENTS SO FOR EXAMPLE. THERE ARE MANY CALIFORNIANS UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO OUR VERY -- HIGH COST OF HOUSING NOW THAT. HAVE BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. BY THE FACT THAT THE LAST -- DID THIS FEDERAL TAX ACT PUT A LIMIT. ON THE AMOUNT OF MORTGAGE INTEREST YOU COULD DEDUCT. SO IF WE WERE TO CONFORM WITH THAT WE WOULD BE DOUBLE WHAMMY HITTING CALIFORNIANS SO I'M VERY PLEASED THAT THE ADMINISTRATION CHOSE NOT TO RECOMMEND CONFORMING WITH THAT AS JUST ONE EXAMPLE. THANK YOU FOR INTEREST ON THANK YOU. CAN YOU -- TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES OWNS AND THIS IS OBVIOUSLY -- A VERY -- FAVORITE MODALITY RIGHT NOW FOR INVESTORS AND SEARCHING OUT OPPORTUNITIES OWNS AND I UNDERSTAND THE FEDERAL TAX BREAKS TO COME ALONG WITH THAT -- BEFORE WE ENTERTAIN THIS THIS BILL WHAT IS THE PRESENT -- TAX BENEFITS FOR CALIFORNIANS AND INVEST IN OPPORTUNITIES ON IF ONE EXISTS AND IF SO WHAT WE TAKING AWAY. YES SO THE OPTION IS OWNS OUR NEW VEHICLE THEY WERE ONLY CREATED AND THAT FEDERAL TAX BILL. SO THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS AROUND HOW CALIFORNIA CAN ADD ADDITIONAL INCENTIVES THAT ONLINE IN SOME WAYS WITH WHAT'S IN THE FEDERAL BILL. SO THOSE DISCUSSIONS BECAUSE WE HADN'T SETTLED ON ACONCLUSION YET THEY'RE NOT IN THE BILL BEFORE YOU BUT THE ADMINISTRATION IS COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND TRYING TO GET SOMETHING DONE ON THIS ISSUE BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR. OKAY SO YOU ARE LOOKING TO HAVE SOME TAX BREAKS. TAX BREAKS ALONG WITH THE OPPORTUNITIES ON FEDERAL ACT ALTHOUGH I SHOULD SAY THE ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION WOULDN'T BE A COMPLETE CONFORMITY AND THAT SIR -- BUT BUT SOME TYPE OF PROGRAM WHERE WE SEE THIS AS A AS A WAY TO HOPEFULLY ALLOW US TO ACQUIRE LAND AND PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THROUGH THIS THIS THIS MECHANISM AND I DON'T KNOW IF WE WERE GONNA BE STIFLING THAT EFFORT OR NOT SO. APPRECIATE A CLARIFICATION ON THAT. THANK YOU COLLEGE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS -- THANK YOU FOR THAT WILL OPEN UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT.
