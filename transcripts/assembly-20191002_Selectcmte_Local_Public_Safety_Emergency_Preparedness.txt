afternoon I'm sorry and and welcome everybody -- to the city Montero are regarding our hearing on first great preparedness I'm for I am assembly member Freddie Rodriguez chair of the select committee on local public safety and emergency preparedness and thank you all for being here today for this very important hearing also want to thank those during restore live video feed this afternoon thanks for joining us as well today's hearing is on the subject of evacuation plans at the local level and earthquake preparedness which stems from the recent earthquakes that rattle southern California July fourth and July fifth earthquakes that struck ridgecrest this year were measured at six point four and seven point one magnitude earthquakes and ours are stern reminders that server of quakes can happen at any time and any place and the big one is still yet to come we'll be hearing from representatives at the state county and local level whose testimony or provide insight on how our government is prepared to evacuate large masses of people in response to announce our disaster in this case the server earthquake how respond our community in a time of disaster is only as good as how well we have trained and prepare for a career in merchant services has taught me that this turn will also provide an opportunity for members of the community to listen and learn what to do in the earthquake disaster and who they must reach out to for systems and information will also put the legislature in a better position to assist local governments in preparing and responding to earthquakes and in all developing coherent evacuation plans that will help all Californians and ultimately save lives I intend to take over here today to work to ensure that it even better tomorrow by working with stakeholders a residents also want to thank those in advance for participating here today at this time I would like to welcome assembly member Medina and likes if he has a few words reform for thank you assembly member Rodriguez -- good to be here -- recently got back from Mexico City -- I chair the select committee on California Mexico and while I was in Mexico City it was the anniversary of two of their of a very serious I I was there for their -- drill happen to be there on the day that they were the whole city of Mexico drilling -- doing -- evacuation drill on that anniversary of both of those earthquakes so I know how important it is to California I thank -- assembly member Rodriguez for -- put in this hearing together and look forward to much valuable information today thank you without said there will be an opportunity for public comment at the end of the hearing thank you all for coming this afternoon and I look forward to an informative discussion and before we go for those who I want to make sure everybody who ever has cell phones make sure we silence are some phones we don't have in your options as you move forward so with that I'd like to invite our first panel -- to come up Jeff Tony who was the southern region administrator for the of the California office of emergency services Mr turning we look forward to hearing from your review of the state trump artists and preparing and responding to an earthquake disaster and how the state assist our local governments are responding to a disaster as well as the status of the California earthquake warning system and the southern California catastrophic or three plan so with that when you're ready good afternoon Mister chair and members -- again I'm Jeff Tony I am the southern regional administrator for the governor's office of emergency services here in our southern California region -- home based at Los Alameda us on the joint forces training base that's our headquarters here down south thank you again for having all of us today he timely has we know we all got a little wake up call on July fourth and July fifth with our office was a very active in that response and continues to be in the recovery as well I'd like to start off pretty basic -- kind of emergency management one oh one -- with the the number one tenant and emergency management all disasters are local they start and the end at the local level the state's here to supplement to support how we can but if the local government can take care of it fantastic and as you can see with this slide here there's the five different levels of response as we do it in the state and it's the standardized emergency management system or Sam's and this is the cornerstone of our response and recovery operations in the state again we're in the city of Ontario today if there were an earthquake and the field first responders can handle it that's great if they need additional support that's one local government would step in the city of Ontario they were perhaps open their emergency operations center provide more specific portent resources to our first responders out in the field if it's bigger than that may need additional support they would go to the county the operational area of all local jurisdictions all special districts within those county lines and if it's bigger than that that's where my office would step in and Los Alameda stats are southern California region were a big region eleven counties and if we need more support we go on up to Sacramento at the state operations center and if it's truly catastrophic then we as the state would ask federal government and FEMA been very close partners of us in the past several years and and additionally all jurisdictions must use the structure it's been not that a construct that came about after the nineteen ninety one Oakland hills fire this kind adds more structure to the chaos that use the an incident command system to manage incidents and it works really well Californian and in fact it was a it's a national model and we're proud of it so the state of California emergency plan this is our blueprint of how we do business encourage you to do it as well as the public there's a lot of fantastic information in there again it's got a few parts to it -- it defines our roles and responsibilities who does what in an emergency what state agency is responsible for what function it also spells out responsibilities for local governments -- and as well addresses specific hazards and here in California as you can -- we basically have any any hazard imaginable I mean we we run the gamut we've got volcanic hazards earthquakes pandemic agricultural disasters tsunami terrorism at cetera etcetera this plan is designed to address all hazards also in this plan you can find information on our mutual aid system in California we do it very very well in in California -- the master mutual aid agreement was signed in nineteen fifty our law enforcement agencies in our fire agencies -- do mutual aid I think better than anyone and we're we're really lucky to have that system in place we also do alert and warning communications and cover all phases of emergency management from preparedness mitigation response and recovery it also outlines how do local government requests those resources again I'll I'll take you back to that Sam slide go up that chain and when when the government the state whoever federal government we want to fill gaps we want to fill those needs use the structure it's worked very well now this is a big endeavor of ours that we're doing right now this is a rewrite of the southern California catastrophic earthquake plan we wrote this plan in two thousand eleven and I've spent the last two years -- refining this document workshops here in southern California and a litany of other working groups in meetings all throughout the state the plan covers and plans for twenty one major earthquake faults in southern California do is basically plan for the worst case scenario we plan for that big the big one the seven point eight earthquake on the southern San Andreas fault starting at the Salton sea rupturing all the way up through LA county and northwards even answer Kern affecting twelve counties this is a region wide event and the numbers themselves are pretty overwhelming -- we front statistical models and a scenario like this we could see we could see twelve thousand deaths over a hundred and seventy five thousand injuries buildings destroyed urban fires going on infrastructure down utilities down and an estimate of two hundred and thirty two billion dollars in damage we wanted to plan for the worst so we can see what contingencies we have in place locally the state level and the federal level to deal with consequences like this and we're grateful for FEMA they've been great partners bear with me on the side I know there's a lot of words but let me let me take you through it about some of our partners in contributors to the plan -- again FEMA -- department of defense department of transportation and other federal agencies were all major players in this -- the state all state agencies played a role in this -- local governments all twelve affected counties were key contributors to this plan -- tribal governments nonprofits and also the private sector this is a whole community approach we need everybody's input we all have a vested interest in this and this plan FX nineteen million people and we're all in this one together so at the end of the day we're gonna have a really good products -- were about eighty percent done with the project -- we want to socialize this plan as well as test an exercise the plan as well -- that's gonna happen this upcoming year there were two side projects that coincided with this process -- we asked all twelve counties to provide us with their fuel burn rates what are your public safety agencies use monthly for fuel and we got a lot of this information fuel they say could be the Achilles heel of this response there will be a fuel shortage knowing that information today is really really beneficial should something happen another side project is come out of this is logistical staging areas right now we've done several county is already were continuing to do more we want to hit all twelve here identifying key points of distribution where we can ship food water commodity sheltering supplies so we now can fifty three five three foot trucks get in and out of this area can we land helicopters here can we land fixed wing aircraft here so this knowledge beforehand it will be absolutely essential come come day get day a game day and I want to just also emphasize how important the process was just going through this we learn something every time we did one of these workshops and the more data we collected the stronger we we will all be -- second bullet I want to focus on I know it's tough to read but this will make or break your response the last let's say three to four years in California with our wire well wild fires debris flow mud slides said truly been catastrophic so what has helped us manage this is the multi agency coordination concept and the task force concept so I'll give you a couple examples for the wild fires there's there's key problem areas after any type of disaster I column themes you can call on tax task forces mac groups what have you so some of these commonalities especially with the fires were debris removal debris removal is a huge deal typically the most expensive component of any disasters debris removal housing task force where people gonna live watershed task force our watersheds have been decimated by these fires so we bring in geologists hydrologists engineers firefighters everybody to analyze the thread a watershed schools schools get disrupted how worst our students going to continue to learn and for the first time animal task force we stood up in -- the campfire in paradise we had to feed care for and shelter animals for months there was a big big endeavor small animals pets large animals two horses mama's you name it -- but this model has worked and so you see in in the catastrophic event you see there's a lot more of these groups and a lot more areas of focus that we will need to hit transportation access will be one of the first things that will happen you need to get to the side of the dam and she needs a clear that debris off of major freeways you need to make sure our rail lines are back up and running -- I mentioned fuels and commodities we we will immediately the state and FEMA push commodities out to these sites food water shelter supplies whether it's needed or not we want to make sure it's there mass care and shelter again housing and schools utilities electricity so what we need to do is gather the right people from the right agencies include the private sector and form subject matter expert groups to make critical decisions and the tackle these problems so this is it's worked well in the past few years this is just a hundred times bigger than what we face so far I did want to touch upon this this is the unified coordination group we call the UCG these are the decision makers all right this typically takes place at the state operations center the governor overseas this but you have a high level decision makers from from key departments agencies and groups you'll have the California National Guard be a big player the adjutant general probably general bald one would be in there my boss director dealer dude she would most likely be the state coordinating officer you have a federal court navy coordinating officer you'd have the commissioner of the highway patrol and there you have Caltrans key agencies public health department of finance department of education -- FEMA's definitely in there as well as a department of defense coordinator it should we need those military assets so you have this core group and what I do down here in the field I send my staff out on the ground to the field to county emergency operation centers and the city or city emergency operations city to get out to to centers to gather that informational awareness female will do the same National Guard will do the same so you have all levels of government shoulder to shoulder in these emergency operations center so it's right there physically feeding information and situational awareness up to this you see G. group so they can make the right decisions when you're looking at a scenario like this resources will be scarce we have to prioritize we have to be real about it and this group will ultimately make those decisions not very excited about this you've probably heard about it earthquake early warning newer technology -- that we spent -- additional monies on we did get funding in this last budget round that was that was great for testing and I didn't know this until a few years ago but there's actually to shock waves that happens with with that with the serious earthquake it's called a P. wave that comes first then there's no shaking involved with that a little burst of energy there's a gap followed by that damaging shockwaves causing the the shaking at the end and the damage and that gap is key that gap could provide needed seconds to act upon all up and down the state the state those sensors pick up that P. wave transmit it to computer systems that run the model how big was it where was it how much time you have very exciting -- we've had a partnership with the U. S. G. S. and also you -- UC Berkeley with with a new app that we're testing right now and I am one of the experimental app users at and I think it's very exciting technology -- about three weeks ago we had a four point oh earthquake in riverside county in the town of will the Mar I was sitting at my desk at Los Alameda us I got the earthquake alert on my Pham H. it showed me three point nine something it showed me will the Mar and I sat there and sure enough about four seconds later got the little jewel it worked in action I was very excited to see it work in action and four seconds is enough time I I thought it was a three point nine I did need to get under my desk but had it been bigger I would of those key seconds count we have plans to roll this out an alert people over cell phones wireless emergency alerts so if it meets a certain threshold -- entire geographic regions could get alerts -- on your cell phone and you know looking into the future I would love every California to have this on their phone the capability it has practical applications if you're having brain surgery I would really like the this the surgeon to back away -- if he gets that earthquake warning certain fire stations couldn't get their doors open because they lost power so the fire trucks could not respond there's a couple stations in Los Angeles county that are set up in and hooked up to the system they will automatically open so that's a very big public benefit slowing trains down subways that's very very valuable -- and could save lives pipelines electrical grid shutting things down pre shockwave save a lot of money and a lot of lives and there's much much more -- so we're testing it right now we're very close and -- more to come on this one and -- gentleman that's all I have is formal testimony but I'd be happy to entertain any questions you have can be in any questions are just a couple questions I have for the work you're doing out there regarding the -- the preparedness and portion of everything and -- question is how does Korea cow -- yes review and share their emergency plans with with counties and is that something that's -- dated -- yearly or every other year I was a so our our state plan is available to to anybody in California -- we assess counties with the element of their plans -- we review these county plans we recommend updating these about every three years I think that's prudent things change development happens you communities change I think three years is a good guideline crosswalk where we will we will run through the plan in its entirety and will check off if it meets certain elements does it have -- alert morning elements in it does it address all the hazards so we review it market up provide feedback if needed and and that's our review process -- working with local government and then I had another question regarding health care in part of the think -- -- this one here was enormous on before or after of light yeah healthcare transportation healthcare sorted mean by health care on that of the public health component pretty much for for -- when you have so many injuries you have to you have to exercise these medical health plans it's a another medical health side is a is a key component partner of of any disaster so that include sheltering support that includes it could be -- patient evacuation that's that's also things working with them ambulance companies working with department of defense on how to of that triage and evacuate patients that's part of the process to component partner but it's one I'm asking I know -- when I started the legislature a couple years ago I know at the time we have mobile field hospitals big one comes at you know the infrastructure alone is going to be devastating out a we get patients from -- from the point of a disastrous was pretty the impact to a hospital -- is there any may be plans in the near future regarding the use of mobile field hospital since we had about one time I know the previous administration I think what Swarts maker that we had those mobile phone hospitals now the kind out when a way out of the different that thinking now was there's no never need for that is that something you think that may be revisited in the future that would be a component -- and and we have talked about that one we do have medical caches of supplies -- strategically located -- we would lean upon the National Guard and probably department of defense they have those capabilities that they could set up for us and just one last question regarding the early warning system -- so say the earthquake is center here in Ontario how far out with that US alert would go to read just a county or or to go by jurisdiction or how how would that work I I depends on the size -- it you know and and I can't speak to the specific Al Gore them that they use -- I'll give you an example from the the Loma Prieta earthquake nine I'm dating myself -- from the epicenter she if this technology was available then -- the marina district downtown San Francisco would had about twenty seconds occur of warning -- but you know if it's that five point oh magnitude we want to we want to get it out pretty far and wide okay all right thanks a Jeff if there's one of the questions thank you overhead move with the our second pounds thank you now begin with the city of Montclair and somebody in accounting -- yes I'd like to welcome our second panel which consists of denim when when you office assistant emergency service manager for the somebody in a county office of emergency services and to represent us from city Montero Anthony Cannella fired ministry emergency manager as our next serves our presenters come to the table like to gain an overall understanding of how the city and county prepare for earthquake disaster and respond with a mass evacuation when it's warranted respectively so let's start with Mr manuals go for when you're ready good afternoon -- Daniel millions of system emergency services manager for -- salmon a Dino county office of emergency services -- chair culture -- happy to be here thank you for the opportunity to provide input hopefully what I sure would be helpful for you and for those others that will utilize information to hopefully strengthen our emergency response instead of California -- just just kind of wanna piggy back off some of the comments said -- Jeff made more or more to provide a a positive testimony to how the process here in California has worked and worked well in my experience -- we utilize a lot of the processes that Jeff talked about just a few minutes ago with our activation a response to the -- recent trona incident and still salmon a Dino county we also have our own -- emergency operations plan IT UP which is available online and it's a high level -- guide strategic guide for -- that outlines our operational area the counties approach to managing incidents and it's no secret that we rely upon the same to the Jeff mentioned so basically my job the way I explained it to folks is that emergency management our primary role is to bring organization process and protocol in time of chaos and we utilize out by talked about the standardized emergency management system -- incident command system the -- national incident management system those are all tools that we use while I don't expect the the average member of the public to be familiar with those areas I think the confidence that we can share with them and and and the committee here is that those that are involved in our discipline are familiar with those and we utilize those tactic than those processes to work well with each other and everyone a callow yes so Jeff also talked about and I'm going to kind of jump around here a little bit will this presentation -- just to kind of reinforced some points -- so our E. emergency operations plan obviously like Jeff mentioned is also in collaboration with everyone from -- government business -- you name it there are involved in the providing input -- for developing our emergency operations plan but the the thing that I wanted to kind of focus on here and utilize my time because I know Jeff did a good job of touch in a lot of these things here is that so for example when when we were in trona and we activated our emergency operations center as Jeff mentioned all incidents are handled at the lowest local level still trona is an unincorporated area of the county hence that give us those jurisdictional authority to provide immediate support to that area so part of my role at the emergency operations center was to -- coordinate and dispatch a response to help those impacted by the earthquake so as part of that response we immediately set up what we call commodity points of distribution and that's what we could provide just basic humanitarian needs to those impacted things such as water ice -- come for kids -- also -- -- behavioral health services there and that was set up -- probably within sixteen hours of the of the earthquake striking those of folks up in trona so that's our rule at the EEOC no the the other thing I wanted to to stress upon is cal -- yes is always available to assist us so as soon as we activate our emergency operations center the state hello yes dole -- activate their regional emergency operations center in support of our efforts so there's this cascading affect the folks being on stand by from the local level to the state level to the federal level if needed and and the remarkable thing about this process or why it works is because it allows us to coordinate in such a way that we don't step on each other's toes and so as a resources come in whether they come in from the highest level at the federal level they're still gonna be locally managed and coordinated at the lowest local level so I just wanted to highlight that that system does work -- and so I just want to bring that to your attention the the other thing is to in our world there there could be a little bit of a of a misconception perhaps when we talk about evacuation stern disasters well obviously evacuations play a major component to a lot of different types of incidents where there'd be a fire of flood man made event or even an earthquake but in this particular case of trono -- there was a lot of homes in infrastructure that was damaged we don't necessarily see a need for -- large scale type of -- evacuation effort the way we handle that and what I have here up on the screen right now is Sam regional counties approach to providing services to residents that are dislocated due to an emergency we have what we call a shock or a shelter operations compound into what we did up in trona is we actually activated a hybrid of the system and the reason why we did that was because the city of Rick a rich Chris was gracious enough to offer their shelter to provide shelter services to the residents of trona because of the logistics involved it was the the best approach to provide services to residents still while we handled a lot of the -- commodity points of distributions in the general trona area for folks it needed -- shelter services we transported those individuals to the city of ridgecrest about twenty twenty five miles away if if something like this were to happen in a different part of San Medina county and we did have to offer -- activate a shock then the shock would provide the county a basic one stop shop approach to providing services for those impacted which would include an election going on we can set up -- our register office of voters can set up -- -- place for folks to cast a vote of we have pretty much every single county department at our disposal including -- behavioral health department of aging chill Jim services preschool services but in addition to that the great thing about it is in collaboration with with the state is we can bring in state resources department of motor vehicles department of insurance or any other department where there's a needed gap to provide services to the residents so so that's kind of our approach for the county and a shock is is really and -- designed to accommodate anywhere between three thousand to five thousand folks that have been displaced due to an emergency so so we're really proud of that program but I think most importantly for us -- is that we've tested these plans and so there are their battle tested we realize that one no plan no approach is perfect we feel highly confident in our ability to execute -- these plans in this process is to be able to provide services to those that are impacted so that's that's sort of in a nut shell the county's role and so you know if we you pose the question of what if the city of Ontario would would face to an earthquake well our our response would be to rely on of my friends and my partners here Mister Collette on Mister Chung they would be the first ones that would coordinate resources here at the very localized level activating perhaps probably more than likely they're emergency operations center that in turn would trigger us to activate our emergency operations center and that will create the cascading event for kello yes to activate their regional emergency operations center so I I I say all this not knowing everyone's -- understanding of the processes so I take this opportunity is an advocate to just kind of share that information -- I know that there's members of the public and others who that might not be aware but that's the process that we use your and local government so with that be happy to answer any questions that's a which square had move onto city Montero so whoever like your first the afternoon and and thank you for having us today -- my intended to Tony's afternoon instead of kind of how we do like business in local government a mystery director venture -- fire department our department responsible for providing fire rescue related public safety service in the city's hundred and seventy eight thousand permit residents one thousand a hundred thousand daily visitors and commuters and fifteen thousand daily passengers to the International Airport the charges within my command is oversee a fire departments emergency management division also known as a cities office emergency management with this today's entered as emergency manager Mister Raymond Cheung is responsible for the direct oversight of the city's emergency disaster readiness in this is having the capability and capacity to stand up to extraordinary emergencies and disasters government has plans procedures equipment tools supplies and train staff to help us meet this responsibility readiness may be summed up as having the plans procedures resources to a stand respond to recover from extraordinary emergencies and disasters these plans procedures and resources are then employed or deployed by well trained equipped and capable staff a compendium of achieving readiness requires a purposeful and meaningful cycle of planning equipping training exercising evaluating and adjusting to changing the threat environment lessons learned from past disasters and changes in local emergency response in support capabilities local governments emergency planning capability building city building is centered on the specific threats and hazards to that jurisdiction these threats and hazards then analyzed and assess to quantify associated risk involved abilities to the community plans procedures capabilities and capacities are then built around those that are needed to withstand respond to recover from threats and hazards that pose the highest risk and have the highest probability of impacting our communities threaten rest each community are dependent upon many factors not limited to climate geography elevation population population density built up infrastructure and other factors each of us here today representing different jurisdictions levels of government have our own set of threats and hazards unique to our communities with this in mind or individual preparedness efforts as mentioned today -- well based on the same sound emergency management principles practices and standards will be unique uniquely premised upon our own particular needs emergency evacuation one of those emergency functions unique to each of our own communities the city of Ontario enjoys a relatively flat terrain well protected by exceptional flood control devices a measures and devoid of any significant wildland urban interface wildfire threat as such our need to conduct large scale evacuations in the face of a major flooding debris flows or wildfire is a low risk and low probability event are back you Asians are limited to small scale evacuations prompted by localized more routine events I such as structural fires has is materials releases the law enforcement operations earthquakes would be an example of a high impact event with wide scale in broad implications to all jurisdictions seated here today evacuations result of a major earthquake would likely be in response to uncontrolled fire has a natural releases untenable business or residential structures these again would more likely be limited to small sailboat decorations Senate on localize risk conducting mass scale evacuation moving large numbers of people from one affected jurisdiction to another affected neighboring jurisdiction in response to earthquake in most cases would likely not be warranted and made it virtually an impact the receiving jurisdictions I who have also likely not seen the effects of the damaging earthquake the carry out emergency functions such evacuation the local government level we rely on several established emergency management plans and systems many of these already mentioned today but these do include the California standardizing burn to management system the national emergency incident management system modeled after California system the incident command system multi agency coordination system at a local jurisdictions emergency operations plan while these plans the system the rigidly structured they allow for flexibility and now such service frameworks that can be applied to any disaster or emergency these frameworks then allow for emergency functions such as evacuations to be executed even in the absence of unique and specific functional plants as my colleagues may agree to California is local government you're a subdivisions are uniquely postured to withstand extraordinary emergencies and disasters we are well equipped trained and exercise to the size scope repetitive nature of the state's disaster portfolio I like to close with this our readiness requires purposeful and meaningful keep building capacity building disaster response recovery requires executable plans teachers and systems employed they well trained and well equipped personnel our internal capabilities any discernible gap in capacities are complemented by California's robust emergency management system of cooperation resource sharing mutual aid for the supported by flexible and expandable emergency plans and systems thank you with that will move on to a Rendon city Montero thank you thank you and good afternoon emerging manager -- so our partners of already talked about a lot of the systems and processes and procedures we have in place to manage a large scale disasters I'm a take this opportunity to talk a little bit about our specific programs at the local level because as Mister Tony mentioned -- all disasters are locally managed a summer -- kind of highlight a few of our -- programs we have in the city of Ontario -- here in Ontario we do have -- a what we call a hot or full time emergency operations center I will talk a lot lot about UC's saccharine already as we are very very fortunate to have this -- UC available that -- it would take only minutes to activate verses -- maybe several hours of for a cold EOC and call the OC is one and may not have tables or chairs a laptop Sir other equipment out unfortunately -- you know many cities do not have the resources to have a hot UC have that -- so what are you see we've got you know it it Davey system with projectors laptops out phones satellite phones communication equipment prepared -- in this facility to be able to manage a a disaster where -- mortal agencies can get together when that face the face shoulders shoulder environment where -- we really we we can come together and solve the biggest problems at hand and face to face can occasions always the the best kind of communication I in terms of how we organize in the UC if you know it's a standards management system -- dot dot it's a command systems Sims nam's -- and these concepts really are -- based out of standard business management concepts of their tried and true -- men and we use them -- every day in Amherst management any UC's led by you see director the city manager or a police chief or fire chief -- that's pretty standard throughout elected officials you know they may be what's in the it was called the policy group advising that you see director on certain -- high level policy to the community as a whole one of the programs are very very proud of here in the west end of San Diego county is what we call the regional you see academy are we all know that training is very very important in terms of you know how we prepare for that -- that big disaster -- you know there's a saying that them the more you of sweat in training the less he pleaded combat and we truly take this to heart a and one the ways we train is through this regional you see economy in the west and this does consist of the cities are on Terrio Rancho Cucamonga -- Chino Chino hills and one player -- and with this is a collaborative effort where we get together and jointly train -- the personal in our cities to our work in the UC's we take a standard set of classes offered by the state of California and these classes are used to fulfill our the a a state type three you see position credential that will allow those those basically trained basically qualified to work in any UC like I said is a collaborative effort you know all all of our cities are limited in our resources so we always want to work together in both response and the prepares phases -- of -- of immersing act and they get the job done hi this is a bi annual Academy so I you know it it's something that we we have -- ongoing I of course you know having the public repaired is also very very important you know that's why we're here as public servants we are here to serve the public -- so we spent a lot of time on ensuring that the public understands how to get prepared and the methods like that that are gonna altered a single bit but -- you know an ounce of preparedness is really worth the pound a response to get the public prepared -- as much as possible -- this we we do conduct up for merit preparedness booths at at a public events a year long preparedness expo -- once years well -- so we take as many options as you can do to you know have those touch points for the public so they cannot they understand that really we need their help and and -- preparing the community as a whole a part of that era is just something that just pass is actually a September is national preparedness month a and now all of us immerse managers go through a lot of different -- efforts to get the our public prepared during this month Ontario we conducted a few of these events including -- Skender hides -- and -- quick escape room a and a kind of a role playing disaster table top exercise I would try to make these events as fun and engaging as possible because you know disasters are not necessarily the the -- no most fine topic that do think about or discuss so we try to engage -- engage folks the the get the better prepared another way we get people prepared is through our radio on Terrio campaign -- this includes a website that we host as well this website is kind of our our one stop shop preparedness portal for folks in come in and they don't have a communications plan or business continuity plan they can go on this website and download a template to fill out also includes a different supply lists that people can go out and you know if if they need a Mrs by the don't know what to get you know we give them that list on and also a volunteer opportunities for people to if they want even more involved or learn how they can participate in the response efforts on those are listed here as well additionally even real time instant information we include a map on there -- that if we had road closures our shelter locations evacuation areas things like that that would be shared on on this website another way we share information because information we now -- during disaster is probably -- on the our most valuable resource there is or alert on Jerry was a we call it here -- in the city a -- mastication istom system and on this system includes a land line numbers -- that we purchased through the phone company as well as people who register their cell phones for us to contact them during the -- during an emergency shelters and evacuations I would we would use this system to notify the public out we also managed a cert program are too many Mercer Spahn steam on this is response focused we all know that during a big disaster are for sponsoring me extremely excellent extremely busy -- and are going to the highest priority events and -- the public you know they may not see those first responders for quite sometime if they're not that one those you know begins in locations so we trained -- these folks to be able to -- at home and in their neighborhoods be better prepared as well as what are the kind of response tactics necessary to survive those first few hours first few days of that disaster all this in training clue it's a disaster medical operations -- disaster preparedness disaster psychology US team organization and fire safety because we know that of fire following work week is probably going to be no one of the the -- big causes of damage I during that scenario all this is also a way to get in the disaster response process that as well as during the the preparedness phase so I it it's a very very well loved program and and we're happy offered here in the city of Ontario another program that -- we just kicked off actually is what we call the leaders and prepares academy of this concept is is new and growing -- throughout our region and and possibly the state of this is very very close to what the intention of service but really concentrating on the prepare his days were Sir is really looking at response this is all about preparedness -- and knowledge -- of what systems we do have in place a lot of things we're talking about here today but really how they can impact you know preparedness -- individually so -- you know at the end of the series of classes is currently nine classes about twenty hours long of a multi agency -- multi disciplined -- had a training where we have so cal gas so cal Edison our water department -- police fire -- is a nor sage called by operation hope which is about financial a disaster financial literacy no it's a collaborative effort -- and at the end of this class of each of the individual graduates makes what's called prepare his promise where they think about and they actually you know -- make this promise to do more to do something you in you their their -- place of business their school -- their neighborhood you know somewhere where they can really be be that ports of change and act as a leader within -- the -- a disaster preparedness so I we're we're very hopeful that you know this will continue on and grow and and hopefully really couple things out of weird at the local level -- is want to improve upon our alert warning so what I talked a little bit about our -- up earlier -- so we're very lucky to have a master of creation program of this the state of California recently released the learn warning guidelines recommending that all cities have us system like this unfortunate all cities have that the resources as we do this bill will have the system -- and some so something to kind of keep in mind as you -- go about thinking about how we can improve the systems in the state it is whether it makes sense for you know maybe the state level to to have a a statewide system and that really helps in terms of you know marketing the system and ensuring more people registered as a lot of times we do not have a cell phones or email addresses of for people so we rely on an opt in system County have system call alert wide system allows them that additional marketing effort -- to get those folks registered within the county so it's it's a big benefit -- and with the state having fifty eight counties forty four animations municipalities you know that kind of effort I really would go a long way to a shared how the last thing I want to touch on is you know in terms of all will populations we understand that the most vulnerable among us or the most likely to be victims and disasters we know this from every single disaster -- that we research -- you know today you know there's a state as said that forty percent of Americans cannot paid an unexpected formed all the bill I know then that's is not for us you know daily day emergencies but a massively affects how people are able to respond to recover from disasters wall odds with yelp nationwide this is an issue and especially in terms of from look at our homelessness crisis are how however you know it it again it it will impact our disaster recovery efforts to try to contain that crisis is going to do a lot more than just the day to day it's gonna extension into the -- disaster world -- and that's all Ortez might have been a happy to take any questions thank you okay thank you with that I think -- some rumor Medina had a question or two to ask I did thank you very much a lot of valuable information I especially appreciated your addressing what individual families can do to prepare something that was who represents Santa Barbara and in their -- wild fires and mud -- catastrophes that she dealt with and that she brought up legislation and the day -- would like to hear is addressing the the public who who speak very is different languages and the difficulty that Santa Barbara had in that in their communication and I believe that she introduced in and got legislation passed on just that so I prepared it art would would your cities be in being able to -- address don't understand -- English hi I can take that so -- we again we are fortunate on cherry to have a massive cation program -- and through that program we do have the ability to do -- to to have templates to have AB multiple languages -- of pre translated so and so we're able to reach the but those populations you know we are lucky I don't aye aye I don't think too many jurisdictions have that ability as well as we do to be able to that thank you I had a question regarding -- the search teams that we have here Montero office I think those are a big help for our first responders because -- pretty much be the first ones are and some of these -- areas so how many surgeons does on Tero happened with that notices cities like on terror qualifications or I should say -- getting more folks involved so we currently have you know one one on two Sir team -- you know we're what we're looking at is building additional neighborhood teams something we we wanna -- to more of in the future as as we build out -- the program for sure broke from the county side we actually manage multiple Sir -- programs -- in our unincorporated areas as well as some of the city's for example we help the -- city of Fontana upland grand terrace we also have many unincorporated areas that -- we oversee there Sir programs we receive -- -- funding specifically to support those programs in addition to that also system with communication as we also have a least those program which the emphasis is for our Spanish speaking folks of mirrors a cert program but it's for individuals that don't speak English it's for folks to speak Spanish and we're also taking a look at -- expanding that -- to other folks were -- other other languages including it's something that we we are sensitive to and -- we're real proud of our Sir programs also -- regarding -- the city Montero plans is that something on terror you update yearly every other year and it's one thing we do have the plans but is there any table top discussions are or how the plan would working case that a disaster comes because we can have all the plans we want both we don't practice those plans update those plans they're no good so just curse of of what you guys are doing regarding the plans sure I'll go ahead and dress that -- so our our mercy plans Jeff pointed out it is is there on I I don't under update cycle -- but typically is we we periodically -- completely revise rebuild that plan every three to five years every training event every post disaster -- critique and evaluation is we go back it back and just those plans because is we've are adjusted capability we are bill capacities we've applied those lessons learned and that's kind of when the important things that we do is we identify lessons learned from previous disasters but more importantly is we apply those lessons learned to enhancing or bolstering those plans and capabilities so to to kind of that the direct cancer is after each exercise each disastrous EOC activation out we update revised those plans okay and -- one of his one elaborate expel a bit more what are some remember Medina talked about the language barriers with some of these communities -- power plants not only with those folks but with the individuals disabled communities right how do we assist them in vacuum with them as well do we have plans in place for that as well I would imagine so -- yes Sir actually were required to have -- not only language there are plans but we also from a practical standpoint that that's one of the key things that we actually exercise only trying to so so really what we're talking about is the axis and functional needs community which could be anywhere up that has perhaps will we would recognize more traditionally as a perhaps a a disability in terms of maybe somebody that's bound to a wheelchair but it also includes people that may not necessarily speaker understand English those could be folks that could be identified as per potentially having an axis and functional needs -- so we're sensitive to that to those components are built into our plans but as as my colleagues have said from a practical standpoint is exercise in that so so we absolutely do and also wanted to say that from the county's perspective we're real proud of the fact that it's not just about the plants the plants just one component it I I use a sports analogy if we're not gonna practice and we must not will help plants because the plans are not going to be able to be executed unless people put in sweat equity so I'm really proud to say right now is as we speak right now votes for my department actually conducting the table top exercise with our elected officials so something that we take very seriously we're very prideful and it's something that it this committee can take back -- anything that we can get in terms of support for ongoing not only funding for exercise programs and training critical to what we do okay thank you very much for that assn in any of questions okay thank you more with that will go ahead and move on to our third and final panel with that will have -- Chris Malard risk manager from city of Pomona sergeant Caro X. from for the Los Angeles county sheriff's department and send and con associate director of response with the LA county office of emerging management so with that -- will go head start with the city of Pomona when you're ready shop good afternoon and thank you for -- inviting us to take part in this discussion -- this afternoon -- unlike of homeowners -- emergency preparedness program falls under the risk management division of the human resources department with the city -- the day to day handling of the emergency preparedness program is handled by Alex remembers who is our safety and emergency preparedness analyst -- I oversee Mister repairs and also assist in the development of our program and we both report the end to the human resources and risk management director Linda Matthews at city Pomona the city does have an emergency operations plan it's an all hazards plan doesn't concentrate just on earthquakes it -- covers should they occur -- the operations plan is posted on the city's website so it's available to -- anybody that would log on to the website and can take a look at it -- it was adopted by the promoter city council in July two thousand eleven -- we are in the process now of updating that plan process will take a look a little bit to get through mitigation plan -- to go along with that as well -- in the event of a disaster emergency large healers quick the city would -- activated its emergency operations center is manned by city personnel assigned city personnel -- if it happens during business hours -- employees assigned to the center would would -- be instructed to respond there in and soon their duties and and pass that their sign if it occurs -- in the -- -- off business hours the employees have a call in number that they can call and they'll be given instructions if you're assigned to the emergency operations center then you report there it whether it's a nation after a bi shift -- and if you're not assigned there then you're the employees are advise with the to come to work or not and maybe other duties -- will be assigned the -- emergency operations center is housed at -- Brackett field in la Verne the movement to that -- in its -- it does not I wouldn't call it a a hot emergency operations center as -- the city of Ontario ours is more of a a warm -- we do have -- -- equipment -- station that and in the the helicopter hangar within thirty minutes of of the should the need arise EOC will provide support to the field and first responder personnel -- and we will also be in contact with the Los Angeles county emergency operations with LA county through the or system -- the operational error response and recovery system -- that's -- and an online -- reporting system in the event that that is not available -- there are -- hand held radios that we can also reports -- to the county should the city of Pomona need additional assistance we can make the request through LA county -- and hopefully -- resources are available and if not then -- the county will escalate the request up up the line -- is as far as LA county -- they have divided the the county into -- a disaster management areas -- a through H. the city of Pomona is a member of area D. which is composed of approximately twenty three cities in the San Gabriel Valley management area coordinator and it's just -- coordinator who will be the liaison between the city of Pomona and LA county should the need arise as the -- event unfolds -- and -- we trying to get a handle on on the extent -- of the disaster and and keep in mind -- the first responders will will be out there to the EEOC its job is to support -- the first responders but as we we are able to get somewhat of an idea of what's going on the city will then deploy a damage assessment teams -- and we will use those to try and determine that the scope and extent of the damage that's been caused critical areas that need more assistance than others -- and the needs for additional resources -- if the -- disaster occurs during business hours in Pomona has developed -- an employee evacuation plan -- we're we will evacuate -- the employees from city facilities -- so we can get them out safely -- and once they're evacuated the proceed to assign areas where call can be taken -- so that we can account for personnel missing -- then we can advise the first responders when they arrive on scene that that either everybody is accounted for or there are missing personality was in various departments are for whatever we've also a as part of our program -- we have designated for a community centers as emergency evacuation centers Washington Park Palomar's park west month park inclination park -- and -- residents we have had discussions with foothill transit hopefully we can use public transportation to help get them there -- also potentially using an used city vehicles of if we have to roam the streets and and pick up people and and get them to the of Pomona has entered into agreements with the American red cross for shelter operations not overstretched they will come in and and run the -- shelters after they've been set up by city staff city staff have been trained -- in setting up initial running until American red cross -- comes on site the city currently uses called Mixels it's through the police department -- it's a voluntary sign up -- residents can sign up and then they'll receive -- messages -- for for various things and in the event of an emergency messages will be sent out -- we've also organizations the they are are communities and they can help get the word out as well worse we will also use these damage assessment teams and and city employees to go door to door to knock on doors need to evacuate -- and we have a -- it is four hours -- other notifications we we can also use the -- police helicopters well it's got loudspeakers and -- also police vehicles -- that can roam through the neighborhood -- Mona itself does not have a search team -- although there is a Pomona valley -- Sir team up of -- individual citizens together by cal poly Pomona individual retired there she continued on -- and maintaining that Sir program we have through Sir training -- and will pick up again -- in the future -- and that's all I have at this time okay thank you with that -- sergeant are crumbling before so we're actually getting going to myself and so on Connor -- we're gonna do this together and the reason why we're gonna do it together is in LA county -- when it comes to emergency operations emergency management by county code the sheriff is director of emergency response in our county emergency operations center and we're partnered with the office of emergency management which falls under the CEO's office and of the director of recovery so recovery begins at that starts at the beginning of any disaster so word cohabitating in the same building and we support each other and collaborate daily on -- issues within the county of Los Angeles -- just an overview of -- LA county it's over four thousand square miles -- the residential population is around ten million but giving any Monday through Friday depending on the time of day that population could -- rise to fifteen million of just with all the business in all everything going on in LA county LA county has eighty eight independent cities -- their forty seven independent law enforcement agencies twenty two independent fire agencies in over one hundred special districts so we have a lot going on in LA county planned for LA county we we call it the -- E. R. P. R. acronym for the operational area emergency response plan in in that plan that that delegates roles in a door -- authorities county -- see what the city -- sees are responsible for what the sheriff departments OEM office emergency management it just outlines roles and responsibilities in that plan it also talks about our county EOC actually has two functions it is the county emergency operations center for the eighty eight independent cities however it is the emergency operations center for unincorporated areas within the county talks about the roles and responsibilities of the special districts within the county in an example of the special districts would be our -- water districts are school districts that they all have a vital role when we had that really bad day in LA county our Marin T. operations plan or operational area emergency response plan but within that plan there are many annexes that are added to that plan and I think the topic for the days evacuation during emerging -- a major earthquake in in that plan there is an evacuation annex M. then corporates the whole operational area I would say this that with any plan it is only good until the day that bad day happens -- one of our first priorities in our county emergency operations center in out earthquake scenario is to gain situational awareness throughout the county because we do have a valuation plans but we have to validate and that that those emergency routes are still viable with the catastrophic earthquake we know that over passes are gonna be compromised and I do a lot of earthquake preparedness training for my department for my partners within the county and I challenge every class every time I teach a class especially on earthquakes like challenge the class to count the number of over passes they either have to go over or under leaving my class I I my office is in east all the city of east LA I live in the city of Long Beach it is twenty six miles for me to commute to work it took me three days to get the number right because I heard something nice on the radio and I lost count but for me to traverse twenty six miles I either have to go over or under fifty six overpasses and we know that in a catastrophic earthquake over passes are going to fail they are designed cal tech are -- cal tech and -- a Caltrans Caltrans they tell us those overpasses a section of those overpasses are designed to fail if the earthquake is big enough and the reason for that is it's cheaper and quicker to repair that overpasses if we lose the whole over pass so I challenge my students count those overpasses in that just starts the preparedness level for everybody within the county so now I'm gonna turn over to sit on so as my colleague from Pomona pointed out each city is responsible for their own emergency management cop aspects however it's very unlikely that once if in in any significant amount specially and earthquake dot one is impacted and dot shockwave absolutely stops at the boundary of that city that is never going to happen we live in a communal society where we all have to work together so even though cities hop independence there is a very strong sense of collaboration between all cities and the county across the mac areas Bob to work together okay this starts with preparedness initiatives where we all reach out to each other we all show up when one cities actually hosting a community preparedness event to share materials even development of these materials is done in a very collaborative fashion thank if you're preparing together we need to train together the last thing I want to know is the last thing I would really want and an American the county emergency operations center is meeting my counterpart for the very first time off for a major earthquake through our operational area training and exercise during committee we have created a collaborative that gives us all an opportunity to work together towards developing trainings hosting trainings or exercising whether these are table top exercises which are discussion based to actual boots on the ground scenario or even an EOC activation in terms of the operational area Bob as Jeff up Tony mentioned earlier we look at building blocks okay we follow sums all the way through so if a cities impacted the need assistance there are always going to reach out and we're always going to be there to help Bob in terms of an event where we do have a notice in advance there have been instances where -- city asset I'm sorry county assets have been pre stage to be able to assist local jurisdictions one of the biggest things is how do we get information out to the public especially when it's around evacuations Los Angeles county uses the alert LA county system tax and of course I cannot find the brochure right now what the alert LA county system actually does is any land line is automatically registered into the system so if an emergency happens and we have to push a messaging out all land lines will get that call okay individuals can also register their cell numbers their email addresses and if they have pagers pager information whether they would like to receive text messages and dot message can be pushed out by our sheriff's department the message can be in multiple languages and it also has accessibility features and with the alert LA messages it it is a very robust system and we can we can push an alert message county wide for we can be a surgical with who gets that message we can we can even draw down to I can notify the Norse out it north side of the street and not the south side I can not pinpoint one house and not their neighbor -- we use it for all emergencies and disasters -- it's extremely user friendly and -- from initiating that or making the decision that we need to push out or not -- alert message it takes about five minutes to designate the area that that messages going to type the message and hit send the system will let us know how many residents a contacted how many contacts failed and then it'll also re dial each number three times and let us know in in actually give us a report one of the drawbacks of the system depending on if we trying do a county wide message because it the algorithms in the computers doing it it's not gonna happen immediately it's gonna take hours for that system to contact ten million people however we've used it in very local emergencies of up to two hundred thousand people in the and in down messaging was completed within two hours -- so it is a very robust system and we're really fortunate to have it so moving on to -- evacuation shelters receptions up centers LA county house several most of them are out our park and rec facilities they have all been assessed for accessibility okay making sure that our facilities are inclusive is a huge priority it's usually the red cross that takes the lead in setting up the box centers our reception centers -- up immediately offer emergency but there are several county resources that have been there whether it's in an unincorporated area or a city jurisdiction dot how provided services that includes our department of public social services department of health services mental health senior services programs as well as our homeless services programs up moving on to public education there are a lot of programs that we have heavily push forward with the biggest one is our emergency survival guides these are available in multiple languages up fourteen languages and counting up the moment our push really is to get the community ready K. the last thing we want is for any resident think off okay I have received evacuation notice for any emergency up for after an earthquake my home is damage I need to relocate to a shelter what should I be taking me okay the purpose of these guides are to make sure that our residents are prepared in advance the other companion docking up booklet that we have is Stacey stand control this is specifically geared towards people with disabilities and others with rocks and functional needs to be able to conduct a self assessment on what their needs are going to be during any emergency our focus really is all hazards because some of the things that you would need for one disaster would definitely carry on to the other and then as far is situational analysis and damage assessment like our colleague said from commodity at in in LA county we use the operational area resource and recovery system the acronym is orders it is a web based system -- wars does two things for us a four eighty eight cities that incorporated areas in our special districts it is a tool that is used for situational awareness to the to the county level what what their status is -- what resources they need and and how they're faring that is one of the tools we use to gain situational awareness and to give us give me to develop a common operating picture within the county -- so what with the wars in our our partners in Amman and they have a really bad day in Pomona they can log in to orders develop a situation report county and then we could follow that up with phone calls and they get it it would give them the ability also if they need resources they can request those resources through wars and then we would follow that up with a phone call to make sure we understand the exact resource requested what exactly they need and then we would dispatch us resources your startup growth and as far so as far as drills and exercises -- I I I think everybody that's been up here on the panel has basically said we play like we practice so exercising and drills whether it's for conducting a workshop going to a table top to a functional tool for skill functional -- we were constantly doing that within the county with our our city partners are county departments we have an annual evacuation drill into paying a canyon it's one of our big concerns -- in and that's a it's a fire scenario for that particular drill but in that community there's only two one way at the north in one way out of the south and -- thousands of residents live there -- and that is an annual drill we do -- regarding earthquakes in LA county we participate in the great shakeout every year and is more elaborate than others but every year the basics of that exercise is we request that all the city's all our county departments and all our special interest rate districts log in to orders and give us a situation status report and N. during exercise it could be make believe what we are we are up and functioning or we are devastated but it it's that muscle memory of getting them to use the system to for that that situation status report to the county level in and we do that annually and we have to drill together train together exercise together up dot is that as a mantra for the entire operational area that's it if you have any other questions or the three is great to hear I'm I'm really pleased to to the information but a question for approach for both city put more LA county talked about homeowner the the community centers and LA county talk about some of the resource committee senator at some of the park something so is there already supplies there at those locations in a bit of a of a disaster okay we go there because that's the evacuation center or site clusters already stockpile of supplies there for the for the city of Pomona we have some supplies -- we are in the process of of trying to augment what we have on hand -- for the issue we have is is finding places to store those -- but we are going to argument in the and then from the county level -- as far sheltering is concerned -- American red cross is one of our main partners in that at the county level we never know exactly where that disaster is going to be so we we don't have pre stays supplies at potential shelters because we never know where the disaster is going to be in addition to that we don't know we we have lists of potential shelters but depending on the disaster that shelter may be affected the infrastructure may be compromised so we do not have pre stage supplies at shelter potential shelter locations but we do work closely with red cross and once we we need to activate a certain sheltered then we immediately dispatch -- supplies and support to that shelter when I was going out to that one of the things that we actually lead was up we work with the American red cross -- for durable medical equipment what their needs would actually be we created a list with our operational area partners we actually procured those supplies Bob and they're managed by the red cross but as my colleague from the sure sponsored the red cross is the one that actually moves those assets around up there not actually pre stage simply because we don't know where the emergency will I am done for city appoint you talked about there isn't any really active Sir or new Connor is a certain but not really so to speak it is so they're looking at maybe wrapping that up somehow to make sure we have the teams there as like on our sister city here in Ontario as of the system operating wrecked it there is there is a certain team -- based out of Pomona but it is not a city of Pomona searching -- as I said it's it's made up of independent jewels from the community that will really formed by person for cal poly Pomona -- as I said one of the things that that we would like to do we have train some city employees -- said the to the cert program -- in we would one of our plans is to get every city employee through that program as well -- and hopefully establish a city of Pomona certain in spring of promote a particular I know you made much of the beginning regarding a year the O. C. at Brackett field that's somewhat odd being outside is actually a technique city laverne so something happens in in Pomona and say infrastructure we talked about the bridges only talk about bridges right comma so many bridges obviously the main arteries I'm thinking about in the top of my head -- Whyte Avenue Gerry Avenue there's a couple the over under passes right does go down so would it be harder to get folks out to la Verne in case infrastructures down so kinda defeats the purpose we have he'll see but it's technically not in Pomona it's outside the city and we have to travel there in a case we have that catastrophic event were you know how we gonna get there because X. one G. the streets or blocked off then what we do is our backup plan the there there is -- the we do have certain vehicles -- with the police department -- ex military vehicles we have a a Humvee -- and then was known as a and M. rap that pretty much will climb over everything if worse comes to worse we can use the helicopter to -- pick people up -- the -- ill see used to be in the basement of fire station one eighty one -- on Park Avenue -- unfortunately when the -- Chino hills earthquake occurred -- quite a few years ago now -- we did activate our our EOC and everybody went down into the basement and we determined at the there's there wasn't -- very good air circulation there was only one way in and one way out through at the staircase that that made a couple of turns that was a somewhat inadequate and the -- the best location the we could come up with was the -- you sharing space with a helicopter at a practice field it's a one story a cinder block building -- should -- the power go out because of an earthquake it's an airport they will have power -- there is it run ways of emergency price mercy supplies need to be flown in by helicopter whatever they can be brought into Brackett field and then disperse from that that point -- we are right across the street from the Fairplex -- we are partnering with the Fairplex -- is they have -- -- as part of their their program that they have a lot of facilities -- showers it and what not that people could use -- and they could also be used as a an evacuation center okay and not just one last question for somebody or LA county folks being were so big and fast in the population over ten million how I mean are we really working with our local cities are eighty eight cities writing we talk about the county to make sure that everybody's on the same page so to speak when it comes to the big catastrophic event cause I know sometimes communication falls through the cracks and people don't really know everything one thing that comes to mind we sure thing was alert LA I don't even know that was here now it's like wow I've been put more in in telecom whole life and I didn't even know there was that -- after you can sign up so how are we making sure that we're getting all the information out to a regular constituents going to be hard even some areas because of disadvantaged communities and maybe not access to internet stuff how I mean do we work with our cities to try to do our best to make sure that the information is out there with everybody up absolutely that's actually a great question there are several mechanisms that we do that through up first which would be our operational or a training exercise during committee up the demon axed out of my colleague from Pomona referenced earlier are a part of this committee as well as cities that of that represent themselves of this committee this is where we plan out our training and exercise calendar over three years this is where we plan our operational area exercises up over a two year period okay -- in addition to that there are up for example on your question your comment regarding alert LA county as it turns out multiple dot cities and Alec are fiercely independent so cities you do have their own up emergency notification system case in point Pomona actually uses Nixle for load of local notifications when we actually go out for community education we carry a list with us to make sure that the resident is getting the right information so if they are resident of a city dot does not how Fuller daily county to have their own system we make sure that we direct them to the right side up at times we do take laptops with us especially when we're out senior centers to make sure direct registration is taking place and individuals are registered for the court Bob for the proper system now the systems do have crosstalk capability of our sheriff's department is actually great reaching out to partner agencies to make sure that the correct message is going out of to the right areas in addition we have of a group called one voice intercom anytime there is an incident or even if it even if they're just training to prepare for one this one weighs group actually house representation from county departments as well as external partners up throughout the operational area and we make sure we are putting out one of accepted message nobody is pushing out conflicting information when you said that and we talked about the fires here in northern California in the napa area and I think there was some of the issues because some individual cities have their own evacuation alert systems and the counties had difference in that were the conflict because nobody was really communicating they're pretty messages out someone someone were in some weren't so there's just conflicting so hopefully that we don't do things like that oversee it in this part of the state what our system that we have that maybe there's a unified plan how we everybody's on the same page right regardless of what alert system you have that when something happens that were are alerting the folks that we need to alert regardless of what system you're on yes Sir so with that said I want to thank you for bringing your information for to without the concludes our portion of our panels so now I would like to invite members of the public if there's any that would like to come forward to for a a two minutes at a time to share any information if there's anybody out there in the public I think you can come forty here to the to the from your to the the the podium in the front good question I'm gonna mark Casey from Chino from what I'm hearing from Chino when I'm hearing from there it sounds like they'll have some shelters and some resources available but they can't take in everyone so I'm assuming for the cities in the county guys would you rather we have someplace in place and we hunkered down at home a listing of our house is really in bad shape actually so that we don't flood the shelters you don't have water and food for all this right okay broach the yes the grocery of some from somebody in here that would hopefully give us some insight to that okay yes ma'am so again Daniel millions from the county of San Bernadino emergency -- office of emergency services so for your particular city you actually have -- any emergency manager and the reason I know that is because she used to work for our department she was recently hired by your city so you have a full time emergency manager and so the city of Chino has their own -- he -- shelter plans in place so we would augment that should they be needed by the city of Chino so the way our process works if there's a a van that impacts your local area -- the the city of Chino would provide services to the point where they can resources needed then they would reach out to us at the county level then we would come in and augment those services whatever they may be but my question is shouldn't high have something in place so that I can stay at my home whether it's inside or outside June I have some bad in some extra clothing some food so that you don't have to bring in extra mean if I can stay there wouldn't you rather me stay at my home rather than run to shelter yes ma'am absolutely a we encourage all of our residents to -- take preparedness efforts -- which will include not only items for yourself and your loved ones but also what we encourage is for folks to think about things like their pets -- and things of that nature anything that residents can do to be self sufficient will greatly -- the recovery response phase of thing so the less folks we have to worry about the better the response is going to be for the over arching approach I think most people think you're going to take care of them we don't need to tell me if I watched my neighborhood my family my friends my neighbors there's very few of us that have kids in place they think you're going to take care of but I think they need to learn the opposite you need to take care of yourself first and
