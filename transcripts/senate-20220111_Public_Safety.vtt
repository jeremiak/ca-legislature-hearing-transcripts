IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT FAT NAIL

AND TWENTY TWENTY MORE

00:21:06.965 --> 00:21:08.500
SPECIFICALLY THE OVERDOSES ROSE

00:21:08.567 --> 00:21:12.504
FROM TWO HUNDRED AND ONE IN

VOLUMES TO THE NEED FOR THE BILL

00:21:20.445 --> 00:21:21.713
IT CRACKS DOWN ON DRUG CARTELS

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:23.548
AND HIGH LEVEL DRUG DEALERS THAT

00:21:23.615 --> 00:21:25.183

00:21:27.686 --> 00:21:29.755
POISON THE BILL WOULD ONLY GO

00:21:29.821 --> 00:21:30.822
INTO EFFECT SOMEONE IS CAUGHT

00:21:30.889 --> 00:21:33.025

00:21:39.765 --> 00:21:41.133
THAT POSITION OF THIS AMOUNT IS

00:21:41.199 --> 00:21:43.869
SOMEWHAT RARE WHEN I FIRST

COULD REDUCE FUTURE TRAFFICKING

00:22:11.263 --> 00:22:13.565
LEVEL. THE BILL DOES NOT CHANGE

00:22:13.632 --> 00:22:15.367

STRONG WERE- OR AN EFFECTIVE

00:47:04.521 --> 00:47:07.391
STRATEGY- I THINK HAVING A LOT

00:47:07.457 --> 00:47:09.126
OF PEOPLE WOULD BE OPEN TO IT

00:47:09.193 --> 00:47:10.661
BUT WE KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE THAT

00:47:10.727 --> 00:47:12.829
IT'S NOT. AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY

00:47:12.896 --> 00:47:15.599
AND OF MR BACCHUS POINTED OUT-

00:47:15.666 --> 00:47:17.534
WE WERE INCREASING IT HAPPENS

00:47:17.601 --> 00:47:20.170
FOR OTHER DRUGS. ARE FOR MANY

00:47:20.237 --> 00:47:25.842
YEARS. AND PEOPLE ARE. STILL

00:47:25.909 --> 00:47:26.910
DYING FROM THE DRUGS AND EVEN

00:47:26.977 --> 00:47:30.714
MORE MORE SO IN THE- AND SO I.

00:47:30.781 --> 00:47:32.282
YOU KNOW WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT

00:47:32.349 --> 00:47:33.717
THIS IS A TEST AN ABSOLUTE

00:47:33.784 --> 00:47:38.222
DISASTER- BUT IT'S- ADDING AN

00:47:38.288 --> 00:47:39.756
ADDITIONAL ENHANCEMENT IS NOT

00:47:39.823 --> 00:47:43.727
GOING TO- THE TO SOLVE OR

00:47:43.794 --> 00:47:47.798
IMPROVE THIS- DISASTER- POLICE

00:47:47.864 --> 00:47:49.066
AND DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ALREADY

00:47:49.132 --> 00:47:53.270
HAVE TOOLS ON TO ADDRESS THE

00:47:53.337 --> 00:47:54.504
SOON TO SEND PEOPLE TO STAY

00:47:54.571 --> 00:47:56.306
PRESENT- FOR POSSESSING LARGE

00:47:56.373 --> 00:47:59.109
QUANTITIES OF FENTANYL. I DON'T

00:47:59.176 --> 00:48:00.777
THINK THAT INCREASING THE LENGTH

00:48:00.844 --> 00:48:04.081
OF AN INCARCERATION IS GOING TO-

00:48:04.147 --> 00:48:05.949
SOLVE THIS PROBLEM THERE ARE A

00:48:06.016 --> 00:48:07.884
LOT OF OTHER THINGS WE SHOULD BE

00:48:07.951 --> 00:48:09.553
DOING OR WORKING ON SOME OF

00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:11.154
THOSE FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH

00:48:11.221 --> 00:48:13.590
PERSPECTIVE I. AM LISTENING TO A

00:48:13.657 --> 00:48:15.392
NUMBER OF OTHER STRATEGIES FOR

00:48:15.459 --> 00:48:17.261
EXAMPLE THIS YEAR I'M FOCUSED ON

00:48:17.327 --> 00:48:18.462
TRYING TO EXPAND ACCESS TO

00:48:18.528 --> 00:48:20.264
FENTANYL TESTING STRIPS OF THE

00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:22.666
PEOPLE ON THE THESE TERRIBLE

00:48:22.733 --> 00:48:24.034
TERRIBLE TRAGEDIES OF PEOPLE

00:48:24.101 --> 00:48:26.003
TAKING UP WHAT THEY THINK OF THE

00:48:26.069 --> 00:48:29.172
PERCOCET OR OR OR OTHER- HELLO

00:48:29.239 --> 00:48:30.507
AND ENDS UP BEING LACED WITH

00:48:30.574 --> 00:48:32.209
SOMETHING ON A GUY. WE WANT

00:48:32.276 --> 00:48:33.910
PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO KNOW WHAT

00:48:33.977 --> 00:48:35.012
THEY'RE INGESTING SO THERE ARE

00:48:35.078 --> 00:48:37.381
STRATEGIES THAT I THINK- CAN

00:48:37.447 --> 00:48:40.384
HELP- BUT UGH I'M NOT GONNA BE

00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:44.187
ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY

00:48:44.254 --> 00:48:47.524
THANK YOU. SENATOR SKINNER.

00:48:47.591 --> 00:48:50.060
THANK YOU TERROR AND- THANK YOU

00:48:50.127 --> 00:48:52.162
SENATOR WIENER FOR YOUR

00:48:52.229 --> 00:48:55.532
COMMENTS- SENATOR BATES I SHARE

00:48:55.599 --> 00:48:59.770
THE HORROR AT. THE NUMBER OF

00:48:59.836 --> 00:49:01.371
PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIED AND THE

00:49:01.438 --> 00:49:02.439
NUMBER OF PEOPLE DIED ON

00:49:02.506 --> 00:49:04.474
KNOWINGLY BECAUSE THEY HAD NO

00:49:04.541 --> 00:49:06.743
IDEA THAT THERE WAS FENTANYL IN

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:09.946
THE THING THEY WERE INTERESTING

00:49:10.013 --> 00:49:11.581
FOR POTENTIALLY SHOOTING UP. AND

00:49:11.648 --> 00:49:14.851
WHILE THERE'S A LEVEL OF RISK.

00:49:14.918 --> 00:49:17.054
THAT I CERTAINLY AM NOT WILLING

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:19.156
TO TAKE IN ANY KIND OF INJECTION

00:49:19.222 --> 00:49:21.558
DRUG. WE KNOW THAT MANY OF THE

00:49:21.625 --> 00:49:23.794
FENTANYL DEATHS ARE DUE TO

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:26.930
PEOPLE TAKING WHAT THEY THINK

00:49:26.997 --> 00:49:28.298
ARE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. THE

00:49:28.365 --> 00:49:30.133
BOUGHT ILLEGALLY IN BOUGHT ON

00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:32.202
THE BLACK MARKET BUT STILL THEY

00:49:32.269 --> 00:49:34.705
THINK THAT THEY ARE RIGHT THEY

00:49:34.771 --> 00:49:36.606
ARE GETTING A PRESCRIPTION DRUG.

00:49:36.673 --> 00:49:40.110
AND FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW I.

00:49:40.177 --> 00:49:41.678
AGREE WITH THOSE FAMILIES TO

00:49:41.745 --> 00:49:43.113
DESCRIBE IT IS THESE ARE NOT

00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:46.249
OVERDOSE DEATHS. THESE ARE

00:49:46.316 --> 00:49:49.586
POISONING THESE ARE AND WHILE.

00:49:49.653 --> 00:49:52.856
WHILE THERE IS A USE FOR FAT

00:49:52.923 --> 00:49:55.726
KNOWING. SOME LEVEL OF PAIN

00:49:55.792 --> 00:49:59.363
TREATMENT. I WOULD I WOULD. I

00:49:59.429 --> 00:50:00.964
WOULDN'T TREAT THE MEDICAL

00:50:01.031 --> 00:50:03.100
COMMUNITY TO COME UP WITH

00:50:03.166 --> 00:50:04.501
ALTERNATIVES THAT WE WOULD NOT

00:50:04.568 --> 00:50:07.003
EVEN UTILIZE THAT NO IN A HEALTH

00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:09.339
STUDY THAT THERE MUST BE OTHER

00:50:09.406 --> 00:50:11.875
WAYS TO CONTROL PAIN BECAUSE OF

00:50:11.942 --> 00:50:14.044
THE TOXICITY OF THIS PARTICULAR

00:50:14.111 --> 00:50:16.413
SUBSTANCE SO IN AN INTERESTING

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:18.548
WAY I THINK WE SHOULDN'T EVEN BE

00:50:18.615 --> 00:50:21.251
DEALING WITH IT IN ANY OF OUR

00:50:21.318 --> 00:50:23.320
DRESS CODE. BECAUSE IT'S A IT'S

00:50:23.387 --> 00:50:25.389
A POISONOUS A TOXIN NOW

00:50:25.455 --> 00:50:28.258
CERTAINLY WHEN SOMEONE OVERDOSES

00:50:28.325 --> 00:50:30.894
FROM LIKE A STRICT STRICT DRUG

00:50:30.961 --> 00:50:32.562
NOT DENTAL LACE ONE COULD SAY

00:50:32.629 --> 00:50:34.765
THAT WAS POISONOUS TO BUT THAT

00:50:34.831 --> 00:50:38.468
IS A VERY DIFFERENT. THE NATURE

00:50:38.535 --> 00:50:40.670
OF IT IS VERY DIFFERENT- AND HOW

00:50:40.737 --> 00:50:43.173
WE GET AT. BOTH REDUCING

00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:46.576
PEOPLE'S USE OF THINGS THAT

00:50:46.643 --> 00:50:50.013
COULD BE FENTANYL LACED FOR THE

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:54.551
IMPORT OF ANTI. THE SELLING OF

00:50:54.618 --> 00:50:57.154
SENTINEL I THINK OUR THOSE ARE

00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:59.389
VERY THOSE ARE WORTHWHILE THINGS

00:50:59.456 --> 00:51:01.224
FOR US TO BE DEBATING AND

00:51:01.291 --> 00:51:05.395
DISCUSSING BUT I THINK OUR- WHAT

00:51:05.462 --> 00:51:07.364
HAS PROVEN IS THAT. WE HAVE

00:51:07.431 --> 00:51:11.301
SIMILAR PENALTIES FOR SAY SALE

00:51:11.368 --> 00:51:14.371
HERE ONE. SAILOR VARIOUS OTHER

00:51:14.438 --> 00:51:17.307
SUBSTANCES SUBSTANCES AND IT HAS

00:51:17.374 --> 00:51:19.242
NOT REDUCED THE SALE OF THE

00:51:19.309 --> 00:51:23.146
SUBSTANCES. AND SO WHILE I

00:51:23.213 --> 00:51:27.684
COMPLETELY I APPRECIATE THE VERY

00:51:27.751 --> 00:51:30.287
LEGITIMATE STRONG AND NATURAL

00:51:30.353 --> 00:51:33.423
DESIRE FOR ANYONE WHO HAD A

00:51:33.490 --> 00:51:36.026
LOVED ONE FRIEND ANYONE THEY

00:51:36.092 --> 00:51:38.595
WERE CLOSE TO WHO DIED FROM

00:51:38.662 --> 00:51:40.263
FENTANYL ESPECIALLY THOSE

00:51:40.330 --> 00:51:42.299
UNKNOWINGLY THAT THEY WANT

00:51:42.365 --> 00:51:45.001
ACTION. I THINK THIS ACTION

00:51:45.068 --> 00:51:46.670
ISN'T GOING TO GET US THE

00:51:46.736 --> 00:51:50.574
REDUCTION THAT WE WOULD WANT. SO

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:54.277
I AND I HAD A LONG CONVERSATION

00:51:54.344 --> 00:51:55.879
SOME EMAILS BACK AND FORTH A

00:51:55.946 --> 00:51:56.580
LONG CONVERSATION WITH STAFF

00:51:56.646 --> 00:51:59.516
ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE

00:51:59.583 --> 00:52:01.651
APPROACHES THAT COULD ACTUALLY

00:52:01.718 --> 00:52:03.954
GET. THIS STUFF OUT OF

00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:06.223
CIRCULATION. AND I THINK WE

00:52:06.289 --> 00:52:09.192
DON'T. AT LEAST WE DON'T HAVE AN

00:52:09.259 --> 00:52:13.129
ANSWER FOR THAT YET- AND WHETHER

00:52:13.196 --> 00:52:14.998
WHETHER THERE ARE STRATEGIES

00:52:15.065 --> 00:52:17.567
THAT HAVE BEEN USED.

00:52:17.634 --> 00:52:19.870
INTERESTINGLY I WAS IN PORTUGAL

00:52:19.936 --> 00:52:23.173
IN OCTOBER THE ONLY TIME I'VE

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:25.208
TRAVELED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS

00:52:25.275 --> 00:52:26.443
AND AT THE POINT I TRAVELED

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:28.345
THERE WAS AN OMICRON PRESENT AT

00:52:28.411 --> 00:52:29.679
PORTUGAL HAD THE HIGHEST

00:52:29.746 --> 00:52:31.381
VACCINATION RATES SO IT'S KIND

00:52:31.448 --> 00:52:33.517
OF LIKE I HAD A LITTLE FANTASY

00:52:33.583 --> 00:52:36.119
BLOOPERS. COVERT SAFETY BUT THE

00:52:36.186 --> 00:52:38.989
POINT BEING IS THAT IN PORTUGAL

00:52:39.055 --> 00:52:41.124
. WE MET WITH GOVERNMENT

00:52:41.191 --> 00:52:42.492
OFFICIALS PUBLIC HEALTH

00:52:42.559 --> 00:52:46.530
OFFICIALS AND- LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:52:46.596 --> 00:52:49.199
DRUG OFFICIALS IN PORTUGAL THEY

00:52:49.266 --> 00:52:52.435
HAVE LEGALIZED THERE THE OPIOID

00:52:52.502 --> 00:52:54.437
USE OR LEGALIZE IS NOT QUITE

00:52:54.504 --> 00:52:57.607
RIGHT THEY HAVEN'T CRIMINALIZED

00:52:57.674 --> 00:52:59.309
IT IN THE SAME WAY. AND WHILE

00:52:59.376 --> 00:53:00.176
THEY HAVEN'T QUITE SAID IT'S

00:53:00.243 --> 00:53:02.479
LEGAL THEY DON'T CRIMINALIZE IT

00:53:02.546 --> 00:53:05.148
AND THEY PROVIDE- ON METHADONE

00:53:05.215 --> 00:53:08.051
OR THEY PROVIDE FOR PEOPLE WHO

00:53:08.118 --> 00:53:10.287
ARE AT AND- WE ASKED THEM ABOUT

00:53:10.353 --> 00:53:12.556
THAT NO. BECAUSE CLEARLY THAT

00:53:12.622 --> 00:53:14.624
KNOWS A WORLDWIDE PROBLEM. AND

00:53:14.691 --> 00:53:16.593
THEY HAVE HAD VERY LITTLE

00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:19.095
PRESENCE OF FENTANYL IN PORTUGAL

00:53:19.162 --> 00:53:21.631
AND THERE ARE VERY FEW OVERDOSES

00:53:21.698 --> 00:53:23.066
AND BECAUSE WHAT WE CALL

00:53:23.133 --> 00:53:25.201
OVERDOSES IN MANY CASES ARE

00:53:25.268 --> 00:53:28.438
REALLY A OPIOID DOES SPEND AWAY

00:53:28.505 --> 00:53:32.208
FROM THE PERSON. DIES BECAUSE

00:53:32.275 --> 00:53:33.944
THE FEDERAL. SO I WAS VERY

00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:36.212
STRUCK THAT. NOW WHETHER WE

00:53:36.279 --> 00:53:38.548
COULD ELIMINATE FAT NO WORD

00:53:38.615 --> 00:53:41.051
MINIMIZE IT IN THAT WAY HERE IN

00:53:41.117 --> 00:53:42.819
CALIFORNIA I DON'T KNOW WHETHER

00:53:42.886 --> 00:53:44.621
WE HAVE THE APPETITE TO I DON'T

00:53:44.688 --> 00:53:46.990
KNOW BUT I WAS VERY STRUCK BY

00:53:47.057 --> 00:53:48.558
THE FACT THAT. PORTUGAL COMPARED

00:53:48.625 --> 00:53:50.794
TO EUROPEAN COUNTRIES OTHER THAN

00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:53.363
COMPARED TO US. HAS LITTLE TO NO

00:53:53.430 --> 00:54:01.137
PRESENCE OF FENTANYL- SO WHY I

00:54:01.204 --> 00:54:07.811
VERY MUCH. WHAT- GREENWAY.

00:54:07.877 --> 00:54:10.013
TRYING TO IDENTIFY APPROACHES TO

00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:11.681
GET THIS STUFF OUT OF

00:54:11.748 --> 00:54:15.185
CIRCULATION ANSYS STOCK HAVING

00:54:15.251 --> 00:54:16.987
PEOPLE POISONED AND DYING FROM

00:54:17.053 --> 00:54:19.656
THIS BUT I DON'T THINK THE

00:54:19.723 --> 00:54:20.824
APPROACH THAT'S BEING PRESENTED

00:54:20.890 --> 00:54:23.259
TO US TODAY IT'S GOING TO KEEP

00:54:23.326 --> 00:54:25.362
THE CALL. THAT YOU HAVE THAT I

00:54:25.428 --> 00:54:27.230
WOULD HAVE BEEN THAT OF COURSE

00:54:27.297 --> 00:54:29.199
THE PEOPLE WHO SUFFERED THE

00:54:29.265 --> 00:54:35.271
STRATEGIES APPLE. THANK YOU

00:54:35.338 --> 00:54:37.540
SENATOR CALM WATER THANK YOU

00:54:37.607 --> 00:54:41.111
MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO- ALIGN

00:54:41.177 --> 00:54:44.514
MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS OF. MY

00:54:44.581 --> 00:54:46.616
COLLEAGUES FROM BERKELEY AND SAN

00:54:46.683 --> 00:54:49.085
FRANCISCO I AM ACTUALLY HAVE

00:54:49.152 --> 00:54:51.454
BEEN THINKING A LOT ABOUT THEM

00:54:51.521 --> 00:54:53.623
ALL- MOSTLY BECAUSE OF ALL OF

00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:54.824
THE THINGS THAT I HAVE BEEN

00:54:54.891 --> 00:54:56.993
READING IN THE PAPERS AND SEEING

00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:58.595
ON THE NEWS ABOUT WHAT'S

00:54:58.662 --> 00:55:02.332
HAPPENING IN LOS ANGELES- UPTAKE

00:55:02.399 --> 00:55:04.701
IN DEATH. UPTICK IN YOUNG PEOPLE

00:55:04.768 --> 00:55:07.704
USING FENTANYL- YOU KNOW

00:55:07.771 --> 00:55:10.140
RECOGNIZING THAT YOU KNOW THE

00:55:10.206 --> 00:55:12.342
SUPPLY CHAIN HAS TAKEN ITS TOLL

00:55:12.409 --> 00:55:13.476
ON EVERYTHING FROM PEOPLE BEING

00:55:13.543 --> 00:55:16.513
ABLE. TO PURCHASE THE RIGHT KIND

00:55:16.579 --> 00:55:17.981
OF MATTRESSES AND PARTS FOR

00:55:18.048 --> 00:55:20.850
THEIR CARS TO DRUGS YOU KNOW.

00:55:20.917 --> 00:55:24.087
FENNEL IS CHEAP TO MANUFACTURE.

00:55:24.154 --> 00:55:25.455
A WE HAVE INCREDIBLY POROUS

00:55:25.522 --> 00:55:29.492
BORDERS- AND IT IS ENORMOUSLY

00:55:29.559 --> 00:55:33.329
PROFITABLE. WE ARE AND ON TOP OF

00:55:33.396 --> 00:55:36.533
THAT. WE HAVE A VERY

00:55:36.599 --> 00:55:38.768
SCHIZOPHRENIC APPROACH TO. HOW

00:55:38.835 --> 00:55:42.505
WE ACKNOWLEDGE. AND DEAL WITH

00:55:42.572 --> 00:55:46.443
THE DRUG CULTURE THAT IS- YOU

00:55:46.509 --> 00:55:49.579
KNOW ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. AND WE

00:55:49.646 --> 00:55:51.514
HAVEN'T EVEN QUITE FIGURED OUT

00:55:51.581 --> 00:55:53.416
HOW TO GRAPPLE WITH THE SOCIAL

00:55:53.483 --> 00:55:55.185
MEDIA PLATFORMS THATALLOW FOR

00:55:55.251 --> 00:55:58.521
THE SALE. OF DRUGS- I KNOW THAT

00:55:58.588 --> 00:56:01.391
THERE WERE HEARINGS- IN DC ABOUT

00:56:01.458 --> 00:56:04.994
THIS AND- TOOK A LITTLE AVAIL. I

00:56:05.061 --> 00:56:08.565
WAS READING UP ON THIS BILL. AND

00:56:08.631 --> 00:56:12.869
ALSO LOOKING AT CASES. A RELATED

00:56:12.936 --> 00:56:17.006
TO FEDERAL AND OTHER RELATES TO

00:56:17.073 --> 00:56:18.808
ENHANCEMENTS. THERE WAS SOMEONE

00:56:18.875 --> 00:56:20.777
WHO A GENTLEMAN WAS CHARGED WITH

00:56:20.844 --> 00:56:22.178
A TEN MILLION DOLLAR FINE AND

00:56:22.245 --> 00:56:23.847
TEND TO LIE FOR POSSESSION

00:56:23.913 --> 00:56:25.014
ANOTHER PERSON GOT THIRTY THREE

00:56:25.081 --> 00:56:26.549
YEARS FOR POSSESSION ANOTHER MAN

00:56:26.616 --> 00:56:28.718
GOT LIFE FOR TRAFFICKING. SO IT

00:56:28.785 --> 00:56:31.421
SEEMS TO ME THAT CHARGES ARE

00:56:31.488 --> 00:56:33.556
AVAILABLE AND THEY'RE USED IN

00:56:33.623 --> 00:56:36.459
PEOPLE ARE GETTING- TIME AND

00:56:36.526 --> 00:56:39.763
LOTS OF TIME. FOR EITHER THE

00:56:39.829 --> 00:56:40.830
MANUFACTURE THE SALE OF THE

00:56:40.897 --> 00:56:42.699
POSSESSION OF FENTANYL WHICH I

00:56:42.766 --> 00:56:44.400
THINK IS WHAT THIS BILL IS

00:56:44.467 --> 00:56:48.037
TRYING TO SPEAK TO SO I WONDER.

00:56:48.104 --> 00:56:50.206
THEN THEN THE FASTER THE FOR

00:56:50.273 --> 00:56:53.243
THIS. AND SUBSEQUENTLY I

00:56:53.309 --> 00:56:57.580
ACTUALLY WONDER- AND SO AS A

00:56:57.647 --> 00:56:59.149
RESULT OF THAT I DON'T KNOW IF

00:56:59.215 --> 00:57:01.151
WE NEED SOMETHING LIKE THIS

00:57:01.217 --> 00:57:02.719
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IT WILL GET

00:57:02.786 --> 00:57:04.053
TO THE HEART OF THE PROBLEM

00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:06.356
SINCE WE ALSO HAVE TOOLS THAT

00:57:06.422 --> 00:57:07.190
ARE BEING USED BY OUR

00:57:07.257 --> 00:57:08.892
PROSECUTORS WITH REGARDS TO

00:57:08.958 --> 00:57:11.227
FOLKS WHO ARE MANUFACTURING AND-

00:57:11.294 --> 00:57:13.329
SELLING FENTANYL AND THERE ARE

00:57:13.396 --> 00:57:15.431
SOME PROSECUTORS- ARE THERE SOME

00:57:15.498 --> 00:57:17.200
DA'S IN CERTAIN COUNTIES WHO ARE

00:57:17.267 --> 00:57:19.169
SAYING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO UP

00:57:19.235 --> 00:57:21.738
pDEALERS SOLD SO THAT KIND OF

00:57:21.805 --> 00:57:23.473
WORK IS ALREADY HAPPENING WITH

00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:26.476
REGARDS TO- PUNISHMENT. I'M

00:57:26.543 --> 00:57:29.012
ACTUALLY WONDERING WHAT WE CAN

00:57:29.078 --> 00:57:32.649
DO TO GET TO THE HEART OF THE

00:57:32.715 --> 00:57:34.584
ISSUE WHICH IS WHY FOLKS ARE

00:57:34.651 --> 00:57:36.219
FEELING COMPELLED TO USE IT WHY

00:57:36.286 --> 00:57:38.354
IT IS SO HOW DO WE CRACKED DOWN

00:57:38.421 --> 00:57:41.357
ON MAKING IT LESS EASILY

00:57:41.424 --> 00:57:43.560
AVAILABLE OR ATTRACTIVE- SO THAT

00:57:43.626 --> 00:57:45.495
WE CAN HOPEFULLY PAVE IT. AND BE

00:57:45.562 --> 00:57:48.198
PREPARED FOR THE NEXT WAVE OF

00:57:48.264 --> 00:57:49.666
THE NEXT NEW AND CHEAPER AND

00:57:49.732 --> 00:57:52.235
MORE DEADLY DRUGS. THAT WILL

00:57:52.302 --> 00:57:54.938
PROBABLY COME TO US- AND THEN

00:57:55.004 --> 00:57:56.773
WHAT CAN WE DO TO REALLY BUY

00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:58.608
ACTRESS OUR COMMUNITIES AGAINST

00:57:58.675 --> 00:58:01.511
THAT- AND I DON'T NECESSARILY

00:58:01.578 --> 00:58:03.513
KNOW THAT THIS IS THE BILL FOR

00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:04.714
THAT. BUT I AM WITH YOU WHEN

00:58:04.781 --> 00:58:05.849
WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE TO BE

00:58:05.915 --> 00:58:07.650
INVOLVED IN SOMETHING AS IT

00:58:07.717 --> 00:58:09.452
RELATES TO DEALING WITH THE

00:58:09.519 --> 00:58:10.086
ISSUE OF FEDERAL BECAUSE- YOU

00:58:10.153 --> 00:58:12.055
KNOW WITH. IT'S KILLING

00:58:12.121 --> 00:58:14.157
EVERYBODY YOU KNOW FOLKS WANT TO

00:58:14.224 --> 00:58:15.792
HAVE A PARTY AND GET INTO

00:58:15.859 --> 00:58:16.893
SOMETHING AND PRETEND THAT

00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:17.727
THEY'RE SINGLE AND THEY TAKE A

00:58:17.794 --> 00:58:19.529
DRUG AND IT'S GOT PHENYL AND

00:58:19.596 --> 00:58:21.464
THEN. THEY DIE AND IT'S LIKE LOU

00:58:21.531 --> 00:58:22.632
OR- YOUNG PEOPLE FEELING LIKE

00:58:22.699 --> 00:58:24.234
THEY NEED SOME KIND OF COCKTAIL

00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:25.835
AND THEY TAKE SOMETHING THAT HAS

00:58:25.902 --> 00:58:28.238
IT AND THEN YOU KNOW SOMETHING

00:58:28.304 --> 00:58:30.940
BAD HAPPENS- THE HEART OF IT IS

00:58:31.007 --> 00:58:32.675
THE CARTELS IN THE FACT THAT WE

00:58:32.742 --> 00:58:34.177
HAVE POROUS BORDERS AND THE FACT

00:58:34.244 --> 00:58:35.178
THAT IT'S REALLY CHEAP TO

00:58:35.245 --> 00:58:36.646
MANUFACTURE AND IT'S INCREDIBLY

00:58:36.713 --> 00:58:38.882
SYMPATHETIC AND SO IT'S HARD

00:58:38.948 --> 00:58:43.453
THAT. YOU KNOW SORT OF- IDENTIFY

00:58:43.519 --> 00:58:45.655
SO I WOULD BE REALLY INTERESTED

00:58:45.722 --> 00:58:47.056
IN SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT

00:58:47.123 --> 00:58:49.859
BECAUSE- PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

00:58:49.926 --> 00:58:51.527
CHARGED AND HAVE BEEN

00:58:51.594 --> 00:58:54.597
INCARCERATED FOR LIFE SENTENCES

00:58:54.664 --> 00:58:57.367
I WONDER ABOUT THE NECESSITY FOR

00:58:57.433 --> 00:59:00.470
THE ENHANCEMENT WHICH IS WHY I

00:59:00.536 --> 00:59:01.070
AM HAVING TROUBLE SUPPORTING

00:59:01.137 --> 00:59:04.741
THIS. PERIOD VERY INTERESTED IN

00:59:04.807 --> 00:59:07.176
SOMETHING THAT CAN GET TO THE

00:59:07.243 --> 00:59:09.245
HEART OF I THINK THE CONCERN

00:59:09.312 --> 00:59:11.381
THAT ALL OF US HAVE BECAUSE IT'S

00:59:11.447 --> 00:59:14.817
RAVAGING. REALLY ALL COMMUNITIES

00:59:14.884 --> 00:59:18.621
AND- VERY INTERESTED IN WHAT WE

00:59:18.688 --> 00:59:21.424
CAN DO BUT WONDERING ABOUT THE

00:59:21.491 --> 00:59:22.225
EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS

00:59:22.292 --> 00:59:26.129
PARTICULAR- IDEA AND PROPOSAL.

00:59:26.195 --> 00:59:27.163
YEAH BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S

00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:28.765
A RESPONSE MAYBE EVEN FROM THE

00:59:28.831 --> 00:59:30.400
WITNESS ABOUT THE FACT THAT

00:59:30.466 --> 00:59:31.901
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CHARGED AND

00:59:31.968 --> 00:59:34.470
INCARCERATED EVEN FOR LIFE

00:59:34.537 --> 00:59:37.473
SENTENCES FOR- THE SALE AND

00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:39.208
POSSESSION OF CRIMINAL. ENTER TO

00:59:39.275 --> 00:59:41.678
TALK TO CHARLOTTE. WELL I THINK

00:59:41.744 --> 00:59:44.080
THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING-

00:59:44.147 --> 00:59:45.815
RESEARCH THAT YOU DID ON THAT

00:59:45.882 --> 00:59:47.150
TELEPHONE INTERCOM LONGER AND

00:59:47.216 --> 00:59:48.885
I'D LIKE TO ASK OUR SHARE OF DON

00:59:48.952 --> 00:59:50.520
BARNES MIGHT RESPOND TO THAT

00:59:50.586 --> 00:59:52.155
SINCE THERE ARE THOSE WHO HAVE.

00:59:52.221 --> 00:59:53.823
GOTTEN VERY THEORY OFFENSE BEING

00:59:53.890 --> 00:59:56.225
OFF FOR INVOLVEMENT WITH THAT NO

00:59:56.292 --> 01:00:00.697
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER AND I THINK

01:00:00.763 --> 01:00:02.265
THAT YOUR. FARMS MIGHT STILL BE

01:00:02.332 --> 01:00:04.500
ON THE LINE. ARE YOU THERE. YES

01:00:04.567 --> 01:00:06.135

COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE-

01:00:08.237 --> 01:00:09.305
ALTHOUGH I DON'T AGREE WITH THE

01:00:09.372 --> 01:00:10.606
DIRECTION I THINK THAT WE

01:00:10.673 --> 01:00:12.308
SHOULDN'T BE YOU KNOW HONORED

01:00:12.375 --> 01:00:14.110
SURPRISE NEXT YEAR WHEN THE

01:00:14.177 --> 01:00:14.844
NUMBER KEEPS EDGES THAT DOUBLE

01:00:14.911 --> 01:00:17.146
IT NOTHING IS BEING DONE- THE

01:00:17.213 --> 01:00:18.414
SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION WERE

01:00:18.481 --> 01:00:20.883
FOCUSED ON END USERS NOT ON

01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:23.353
DEALERS THEY FOCUS SPECIFICALLY

01:00:23.419 --> 01:00:25.555
ON THE END USERS I'M ALL IN FOR

01:00:25.621 --> 01:00:27.223
TREATMENT BY JILL HAS BETWEEN

01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:28.958
FIVE AND FIFTEEN SEVEN TWENTY

01:00:29.025 --> 01:00:30.994
FIVE PEOPLE IN MEDICINE ASSISTED

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:31.661
TREATMENT FOR OPIATE ADDICTION.

01:00:31.728 --> 01:00:33.196
ON ANY GIVEN DAY AND WE'VE GONE

01:00:33.262 --> 01:00:34.731
ALL IN ON TREATMENT FOR THOSE

01:00:34.797 --> 01:00:35.898
WHO ARE SUFFERING ADDICTION

01:00:35.965 --> 01:00:37.000
ISSUES AND I DON'T DISAGREE WITH

01:00:37.066 --> 01:00:38.768
ANYBODY ABOUT GETTING PEOPLE

01:00:38.835 --> 01:00:40.670
BACK ON THEIR FEET APPROPRIATELY

01:00:40.737 --> 01:00:42.939
BUT THE DEFENDANT THING IS AT

01:00:43.006 --> 01:00:45.174
THE FLAWED ARGUMENT FOR EXAMPLE

01:00:45.241 --> 01:00:47.043
ONE KILO OF FENTANYL ALL ITS

01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:49.445
EQUIPMENT OF FIFTY KILOS OF

01:00:49.512 --> 01:00:51.614
OPIUM OR HEROIN. THE MAP BUT AT

01:00:51.681 --> 01:00:53.616
THEIR TRAFFIC INTO TWO KILOS OF

01:00:53.683 --> 01:00:55.318
HEROIN THAT WOULD BE IF THE

01:00:55.385 --> 01:00:56.252
TWENTY YEAR SENTENCE UNDER

01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:58.121
EXISTING LAWS IT'S CHEAP TO

01:00:58.187 --> 01:01:03.059
PRODUCE. EASTER TRAFFIC. TAKING

01:01:03.126 --> 01:01:05.228
THE DRUG OF CHOICE FOR TRAFFIC.

01:01:05.294 --> 01:01:06.396
AND THE SENECA MARKER YOU

01:01:06.462 --> 01:01:08.331
MEDICAL ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GONNA

01:01:08.398 --> 01:01:09.432
DO THAT WHEN THE NEXT TWO TO

01:01:09.499 --> 01:01:11.434
COMES WELL IT'S CALLED. IT'S ONE

01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:12.335
HUNDRED TIMES MORE POTENT

01:01:12.402 --> 01:01:13.770
FENTANYL WHICH IS FIFTY TIMES

01:01:13.836 --> 01:01:15.138
MORE POTENT. THAN MORPHINE.

01:01:15.204 --> 01:01:16.039
THEY'RE ALREADY THINKING THAT

01:01:16.105 --> 01:01:18.441
SEARCH FOR THE NEW SEARCH- OF

01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:20.777

ROCKS ON PROGRAM IT'S AN OPEN

01:01:24.213 --> 01:01:25.148
ATTACKING THIS. WITH MY

ON THOSE OVERDOSE DEATH IN ABOUT

01:01:40.463 --> 01:01:42.365
A MONTH FOR SOME AGENCIES. SO

01:01:42.432 --> 01:01:43.332
THEY COULD AFFECT THE NUMBER

01:01:43.399 --> 01:01:45.268
PROGRAM WITHIN THAT. I THINK IS

01:01:45.334 --> 01:01:47.103

CLANDESTINE PRODUCED. FENTANYL

BEING SOLD AS A PHARMACEUTICAL.

01:02:33.282 --> 01:02:35.351
THE RISK OF INCREASING YEAR TO

01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:37.353
YEAR- THIS IS NOT A- WE'RE

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:39.255
CREATING NEW DEMAND BECAUSE

01:02:39.322 --> 01:02:41.190
ACCORDING TO YOU ADDICTS. AND

01:02:41.257 --> 01:02:43.593
THE SUPPLY CHAIN IS PERFECT AND

01:02:43.659 --> 01:02:46.329
I WAS GOING THROUGH THE ROOF BUT

01:02:46.395 --> 01:02:46.963
WE DID DO SOMETHING TO DISRUPT.

01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:49.499
THE SUPPLY. AND DISCOURAGE.

01:02:49.565 --> 01:02:51.300
PEOPLE FOR TRAFFICKING FENTANYL

01:02:51.367 --> 01:02:53.069
WE SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED NEXT

NUMBERS CONTINUE TO DOUBLE.

01:02:55.771 --> 01:02:57.974
CALIFORNIANS ARE DYING AT AN

01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:59.709
EXPONENTIAL RATE THAT'S GOING

01:02:59.775 --> 01:03:09.785
THROUGH THE ROOF. AND I BELIEVE

01:03:09.852 --> 01:03:12.121
THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS TO RISK

01:03:12.188 --> 01:03:14.190
A LOT TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

01:03:14.257 --> 01:03:14.790
HALF SB SEVEN FIVE LET'S SEE

01:03:14.857 --> 01:03:16.759

HEROIN OR COCAINE YOU DO HAVE A

01:03:31.374 --> 01:03:32.542

THEIR WAY TO A LONGER YOU KNOW

01:03:41.083 --> 01:03:43.219
NOT IN CARSON. OF I THINK THE

01:03:43.286 --> 01:03:45.054
CONCERN THAT'S GROWING GROWING

01:03:45.121 --> 01:03:46.255
IS THAT THIS WAS PURE FENTANYL

01:03:46.322 --> 01:03:48.291
THAT'S COMING IN AND- YOU KNOW

01:03:48.357 --> 01:03:51.127
HUGE QUANTITIES AND OF COURSE IF

01:03:51.194 --> 01:03:52.261
THAT AVAILABLE THEN THEY'RE

01:03:52.328 --> 01:03:53.563
GOING TO LACE IT INTO THESE

01:03:53.629 --> 01:03:55.131
OTHER DRUGS THAT THEY'RE GOING

01:03:55.198 --> 01:03:56.132
LAY FINANCIAL OR USUALLY THE

01:03:56.199 --> 01:03:57.833
OPIOIDS. NOW FOR KIDS ARE

IT FROM HEROIN AND COCAINE ARE

01:04:00.836 --> 01:04:02.271
GETTING IT FROM OXYCONTIN FOR

01:04:02.338 --> 01:04:04.040
ONE OF THOSE SO THOSE ARE THE

01:04:04.106 --> 01:04:05.775
ISSUES I THINK THAT REALLY THE

01:04:05.841 --> 01:04:07.777

MENTAL HEALTH OR ADDICTION A

01:04:17.353 --> 01:04:19.255
FEDERAL ABSOLUTELY THERE BUT

01:04:19.322 --> 01:04:20.456
THERE'S A PLACE FOR SENTIMENT

DRUGS AND YOU KNOW AND- IT'S

01:04:30.499 --> 01:04:31.167

BARNES MADE A REALLY GREAT POINT

01:04:47.083 --> 01:04:49.051
AT A PANEL I PARTICIPATED IN

01:04:49.118 --> 01:04:51.420
ABOUT A MONTH AGO THAT UNTIL WE

01:04:51.487 --> 01:04:52.822
STOP THE DEMAND WE'RE NOT GOING

01:04:52.888 --> 01:04:54.590
TO STOP THE IMPORTATION OF THE

01:04:54.657 --> 01:04:56.659
PRODUCTION BECAUSE IT FULL. OF

01:04:56.726 --> 01:04:58.928
BLUE GRILL BUT IF WE START WITH

01:04:58.995 --> 01:05:01.530
SOMETHING THAT BOTH. USE YOUR

01:05:01.597 --> 01:05:03.666
BRAIN THOUGHT IN PURELY ONE KILO

01:05:03.733 --> 01:05:07.136

COMING IN A LITTLE PLASTIC BAG

01:05:11.641 --> 01:05:13.042
BECAUSE THEY'RE DISTRIBUTING ON

01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:14.076
THE STREET. SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

01:05:14.143 --> 01:05:16.812
TRYING TO REIN IN I I'M OPEN TO

01:05:16.879 --> 01:05:27.623

INTO A BIT ON THE OTHER FOR. WE

01:05:52.248 --> 01:05:53.783
HAVE LOTS OF. THOSE WHO. REALLY

01:05:53.849 --> 01:05:54.750
VERY INVOLVED IN MAKING MILLIONS

01:05:54.817 --> 01:05:56.986
AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS- BECAUSE

01:05:57.053 --> 01:05:58.454
WE DON'T HAVE A WAY TO FOCUS ON

01:05:58.521 --> 01:06:00.356
THEM AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING. AND

01:06:00.423 --> 01:06:01.924
WE KNOW THAT THEY KNOW THEY'VE

01:06:01.991 --> 01:06:03.693
GOT A FAST TRACK AN EASY STREET

01:06:03.759 --> 01:06:05.227
TO GET THAT STUFF IN HERE. AND

01:06:05.294 --> 01:06:06.929
THEN GIVE IT TO THE PEOPLE THAT

01:06:06.996 --> 01:06:08.664
PUT IT IN THESE OTHER OTHER

01:06:08.731 --> 01:06:09.799
DRUGS. SO THAT'S WHY I KEEP

01:06:09.865 --> 01:06:12.068
BRINGING IT BACK. IN I THINK WE

01:06:12.134 --> 01:06:13.469
NEED TO HAVE AN ONGOING DIFFER.

01:06:13.536 --> 01:06:14.970
AND I'D LOVE TO HAVE YOUR I.

01:06:15.037 --> 01:06:16.672
VOTE TODAY. I DON'T SEE THAT

01:06:16.739 --> 01:06:17.606
IT'S NECESSARILY THERE. BUT I

01:06:17.673 --> 01:06:18.841
KNOW THAT YOUR HEART THROUGH

01:06:18.908 --> 01:06:19.975
THERE AND I THINK YOUR

01:06:20.042 --> 01:06:21.844
COMMITMENT TO TRY TO. MAKE THIS

01:06:21.911 --> 01:06:23.279
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN BE PROUD

01:06:23.346 --> 01:06:24.914
OF IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS THAT

01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:26.849
WE RAN THE WHOLE THING YEAH. IT

01:06:26.916 --> 01:06:29.085
WOULD BE A BOON ON TO OUR STATE.

01:06:29.151 --> 01:06:30.586
MAYBE WE COULD BE THE LEADER IN

01:06:30.653 --> 01:06:31.620
THERE BECAUSE IT'S CERTAINLY

01:06:31.687 --> 01:06:36.492
SOMETHING THAT PLAGUING. OUR

01:06:36.559 --> 01:06:38.127
NATION. SO WITH THAT I ASKED

01:06:38.194 --> 01:06:39.195
YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU SOONER

01:06:39.261 --> 01:06:42.164
COMMA. THANK YOU SENATOR I DO

01:06:42.231 --> 01:06:43.466
WANTED TO RESPOND BECAUSE I

01:06:43.532 --> 01:06:44.867
PULLED THE UP THE- ACTUALLY THE

01:06:44.934 --> 01:06:46.435
PERSON WHO GOT THIRTY THREE

01:06:46.502 --> 01:06:49.105
YEAR. HELLO WAS WAS WAS WAS.

01:06:49.171 --> 01:06:50.840
THEY WERE CONVICTED BECAUSE THEY

01:06:50.906 --> 01:06:53.275
GAVE SOMEONE ONE DOES. AND THEN

01:06:53.342 --> 01:06:58.781
THE PERSON WHO GOT LIFE- HAD- A

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:02.017
LESS THAN A KILO. SO I SAY THAT

01:07:02.084 --> 01:07:03.552
BECAUSE IT'S THERE'S A LOT OF

01:07:03.619 --> 01:07:07.256
DISCREPANCY AND- VARIANCE IN HOW

01:07:07.323 --> 01:07:09.225
FOLKS ARE BEING CHARGED BUT I

01:07:09.291 --> 01:07:10.726
THINK IT DOES GO TO THE FACT

01:07:10.793 --> 01:07:12.061
THAT THERE ARE TOOLS THAT ARE

01:07:12.128 --> 01:07:13.829
OUT THERE. AND I THINK THE FOLKS

01:07:13.896 --> 01:07:15.598
WHO ARE ON THE STREET WHO ARE

01:07:15.664 --> 01:07:16.732
SELLING IN- INCONSEQUENTIAL TO

01:07:16.799 --> 01:07:18.367
THE LARGER PROBLEM WHICH ARE THE

01:07:18.434 --> 01:07:20.102
CARTELS AND JUST THE AMOUNT OF

01:07:20.169 --> 01:07:21.470
MONEY THAT CAN BE. MADE SELLING

01:07:21.537 --> 01:07:23.606
THIS AND SO HOW DO WE FIGURE OUT

01:07:23.672 --> 01:07:25.908
A WAY TO GO TO THE HEART OF IT

01:07:25.975 --> 01:07:27.209
BECAUSE IF YOU TAKE YOU KNOW A-%

01:07:27.276 --> 01:07:29.712
PERSON A OFFICE. PERSON B. OR C.

01:07:29.779 --> 01:07:32.081
OR D. ARE RIGHT AROUND THE

01:07:32.148 --> 01:07:32.681
CORNER. AS LONG AS THERE ARE

01:07:32.748 --> 01:07:36.685
ABLE TO. AS LONG AS PROFITS ARE

01:07:36.752 --> 01:07:38.521
ABLE TO BE MADE. AND IT IS CHEAP

01:07:38.587 --> 01:07:42.291
. TO PRODUCE THEN WE DON'T IT'S

01:07:42.358 --> 01:07:44.660
LIKE WHACK A MOLE AND I THINK WE

01:07:44.727 --> 01:07:46.796
OWE IT TO THE STATE AND THE

01:07:46.862 --> 01:07:48.030
FOLKS WHO ARE COMING IN CONTACT

01:07:48.097 --> 01:07:49.865
WITH THE DRUG FIGURE OUT A WAY

01:07:49.932 --> 01:07:51.967
TO GET TO THE HEART OF IT BUT IT

01:07:52.034 --> 01:07:53.402
SEEMS LIKE BECAUSE THERE ARE

01:07:53.469 --> 01:07:55.137
FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN PROSECUTED

01:07:55.204 --> 01:07:57.273
AND CHARGED AND SENTENCED. THAT

01:07:57.339 --> 01:07:58.307
PROSECUTORS ARE FINDING TOOLS

01:07:58.374 --> 01:08:00.576
TOGETHER WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

01:08:00.643 --> 01:08:02.244
ANOTHER WAY TO ATTACK THE

01:08:02.311 --> 01:08:04.947
PROBLEM- BUT I JUST WANTED TO

01:08:05.014 --> 01:08:05.848
SHARE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF

01:08:05.915 --> 01:08:07.783
DISCREPANCY WITH REGARDS TO HOW

01:08:07.850 --> 01:08:09.985
MUCH OF THE FENTANYL WAS IN THE

01:08:10.052 --> 01:08:11.821
POSSESSION OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:08:11.887 --> 01:08:13.589
CHARGED AND THEN FENTON. SO I

01:08:13.656 --> 01:08:16.792
JUST WANT TO RAISE THAT BECAUSE

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:19.195
I. AND I DON'T WANT A LOT OF

01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:20.196
BACK AND FORTH BUT I'M JUST

01:08:20.262 --> 01:08:21.964
SHARING THIS BECAUSE I WANT YOU

01:08:22.031 --> 01:08:23.866
TO KNOW. THAT THIS IS I MEAN I

01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:25.568
CARE ABOUT THIS TOO. AND I WANT

01:08:25.634 --> 01:08:27.770
TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET TO

01:08:27.837 --> 01:08:29.438
THE HEART OF WHAT THE THING IS-

01:08:29.505 --> 01:08:32.508
SO. I WE LOOK AT IT IS THAT YOU

01:08:32.575 --> 01:08:33.943
KNOW THE POISON WE HAVE RAT

01:08:34.009 --> 01:08:35.444

IMMEDIATELY JUMP TO THIS IS

01:08:39.748 --> 01:08:40.916
POISON THAT'S AFFECTING OUR

01:08:40.983 --> 01:08:42.318
PEOPLE. WE'VE GOT TO FIND AN

01:08:42.384 --> 01:08:43.652
ANSWER WE WOULDN'T HAVE ANY

01:08:43.719 --> 01:08:46.188
PROBLEM- PASSING BILLS THAT STOP

OUR PEOPLE AND I THINK WE HAVE

01:08:53.429 --> 01:08:54.797
TO LOOK AT IT THAT WAY AND- KIND

01:08:54.864 --> 01:08:56.866
OF GO DOWN THAT PATH. AND KIND

01:08:56.932 --> 01:08:59.068
OF GET IT OUT OF THE- PUBLIC

01:08:59.134 --> 01:09:00.936
SAFETY ISSUE. AND ON CUE IT IS A

01:09:01.003 --> 01:09:02.771
SUBSTANCE THAT REALLY NEEDS TO
