00:31:35.327 --> 00:31:39.030 region:rollup2
COURTS THE DISCRETION --

00:31:37.596 --> 00:31:40.665 region:rollup2
TO MAKE A DETERMINATION WHETHER

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:41.967 region:rollup2
OR NOT THIS INDIVIDUAL IS.

00:31:40.665 --> 00:31:43.368 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE FOR PLACEMENT INTO

00:31:41.967 --> 00:31:44.870 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY.

00:31:43.368 --> 00:31:46.805 region:rollup2
SO PROGRESS INCLUDE LANGUAGE

00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:47.305 region:rollup2
PROVIDING FOR VICTIM RESTITUTION

00:31:46.805 --> 00:31:48.473 region:rollup2
EVEN IF SOMEONE RECEIVES

00:31:47.305 --> 00:31:50.208 region:rollup2
DIVERSION.

00:31:48.473 --> 00:31:51.109 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT CURRENTLY WRITTEN

00:31:50.208 --> 00:31:53.512 region:rollup2
THE TRIBBLES NOT PROVIDE FOR

00:31:51.109 --> 00:31:55.447 region:rollup2
VICTIMS TUITION.

00:31:53.512 --> 00:31:57.349 region:rollup2
WHY IS THIS THIS IS A VIOLATION

00:31:55.447 --> 00:31:59.785 region:rollup2
OF MARCY'S LAW?

00:31:57.349 --> 00:32:01.653 region:rollup2
SO YOU'RE CORRECT THE THE

00:31:59.785 --> 00:32:02.387 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE DOES NOT AT INCLUDE A

00:32:01.653 --> 00:32:05.056 region:rollup2
HAM.

00:32:02.387 --> 00:32:06.124 region:rollup2
RESTITUTION BUT THE LANGUAGE IS

00:32:05.056 --> 00:32:07.592 region:rollup2
THE LANGUAGE IS CRAFTED TO BE

00:32:06.124 --> 00:32:08.660 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT WITH OTHER DIVERSION

00:32:07.592 --> 00:32:10.328 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:13.732 region:rollup2
STATUTE.

00:32:10.328 --> 00:32:15.767 region:rollup2
THE VIOLATE MARCY'S LOS --

00:32:13.732 --> 00:32:17.536 region:rollup2
I MEAN I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN

00:32:15.767 --> 00:32:19.304 region:rollup2
ANSWER THAT QUESTION AND HELP.

00:32:17.536 --> 00:32:19.938 region:rollup2
OKAY BUT THEN THE MY LAST

00:32:19.304 --> 00:32:20.405 region:rollup2
QUESTION HER COUNTIES PREPARED

00:32:19.938 --> 00:32:22.140 region:rollup2
TO BE.

00:32:20.405 --> 00:32:22.440 region:rollup2
START DOING THIS TOMORROW

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:24.576 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY.

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:27.479 region:rollup2
SO THE PROGRAM THAT WAS

00:32:24.576 --> 00:32:28.780 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED WAS --

00:32:27.479 --> 00:32:30.549 region:rollup2
TO ESSENTIALLY --

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:32.184 region:rollup2
LEVERAGE THE EXISTING PROGRAMS

00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:33.919 region:rollup2
THAT COUNTIES HAVE AVAILABLE SO

00:32:32.184 --> 00:32:35.420 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A LOT OF COUNTIES

00:32:33.919 --> 00:32:38.323 region:rollup2
COUNTIES IN WHICH THE PROGRAM

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:38.623 region:rollup2
WAS ATTENDED THIS ITEM.

00:32:38.323 --> 00:32:40.592 region:rollup2
INTENDED --

00:32:38.623 --> 00:32:42.093 region:rollup2
TO PROBLEM.

00:32:40.592 --> 00:32:43.562 region:rollup2
BE PLACED IN IS IS A LOT OF THEM

00:32:42.093 --> 00:32:45.096 region:rollup2
HAVE MISDEMEANOR PROGRAMS IN

00:32:43.562 --> 00:32:46.765 region:rollup2
PLACE SO IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING

00:32:45.096 --> 00:32:48.533 region:rollup2
THAT THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO

00:32:46.765 --> 00:32:49.901 region:rollup2
BEGIN DOING THIS --

00:32:48.533 --> 00:32:51.236 region:rollup2
BUT I WILL KNOW THAT THE FUNDING

00:32:49.901 --> 00:32:52.604 region:rollup2
THAT SPECIFIC FOR THIS PROGRAM

00:32:51.236 --> 00:32:53.738 region:rollup2
IS AVAILABLE OVER THREE YEARS TO

00:32:52.604 --> 00:32:56.074 region:rollup2
THE EXTENT THAT THEY ARE NOT

00:32:53.738 --> 00:32:57.409 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE. TO RAMP UP QUICKLY

00:32:56.074 --> 00:32:59.144 region:rollup2
THAT THEY HAVE A LONG PERIOD OF

00:32:57.409 --> 00:33:00.512 region:rollup2
TIME.

00:32:59.144 --> 00:33:01.313 region:rollup2
TO UTILIZE THESE FUNDS CREATES A

00:33:00.512 --> 00:33:03.415 region:rollup2
SCISSORS NO DELAYED

00:33:01.313 --> 00:33:05.183 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION IN THIS BILL IT

00:33:03.415 --> 00:33:06.785 region:rollup2
TAKES EFFECT ISN'T OF SIGN.

00:33:05.183 --> 00:33:07.586 region:rollup2
A SHOULD WE GIVE COLONEL JUSTICE

00:33:06.785 --> 00:33:10.055 region:rollup2
SYSTEM STAKEHOLDERS TIME TO

PREPARE FOR SUCH A MASSIVE SHIFT

00:33:10.055 --> 00:33:13.158 region:rollup2
IN HOW WE PLAY TREAT MENTALLY

00:33:11.022 --> 00:33:14.392 region:rollup2
ILL MURDERS.

00:33:13.158 --> 00:33:15.894 region:rollup2
AND RAPES IN THE COMMUNITY.

00:33:14.392 --> 00:33:17.429 region:rollup2
SO THEY WILL HAVE TIME TO

00:33:15.894 --> 00:33:17.829 region:rollup2
DEVELOP PLANS AND SUBMIT THEM TO

00:33:17.429 --> 00:33:19.130 region:rollup2
THE APARTMENT FOR

IMPLEMENTATION.

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:20.699 region:rollup2
BUT THE BILL IS SINCE THE

00:33:20.065 --> 00:33:21.833 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR SIGNED IT TAKES EFFECT

00:33:20.699 --> 00:33:23.535 region:rollup2
THOUGH.

00:33:21.833 --> 00:33:24.870 region:rollup2
SO IT MEANS NO LAG TIME SO

00:33:23.535 --> 00:33:26.838 region:rollup2

ALLOW INDEPENDENT STUDY HOURS TO

00:37:39.924 --> 00:37:43.061 region:rollup2
CURRENT STATE LAW COUNTS

BUT I'M.

00:37:46.931 --> 00:37:50.201 region:rollup2
WONDERING IF YOU HAVE ANY

00:37:48.266 --> 00:37:51.970 region:rollup2
CONCERNS THAT ALLOWING SELF

00:37:51.970 --> 00:37:54.873 region:rollup2
TO COUNT WITH NO INDEPENDENT

00:37:53.538 --> 00:37:55.874 region:rollup2
VERIFICATION MECHANISM.

00:37:54.873 --> 00:38:00.512 region:rollup2
COULD RESULT IN GREATER FRAUD

00:37:55.874 --> 00:38:01.312 region:rollup2
AND CAL WORKS.

00:38:00.512 --> 00:38:02.547 region:rollup2
YEAH AND WOOD DEPARTMENT FINANCE

00:38:01.312 --> 00:38:04.783 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE ANY DATA TO

00:38:02.547 --> 00:38:06.151 region:rollup2
SUGGEST THAT THAT WOULD OCCUR --

00:38:04.783 --> 00:38:08.119 region:rollup2
BUT MINOR SAYING THAT THIS IS

00:38:06.151 --> 00:38:09.787 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT WITH OF WHAT WAS

00:38:08.119 --> 00:38:12.123 region:rollup2
SUPPOSED TO BE WHAT WE DID COUCH

00:38:09.787 --> 00:38:16.728 region:rollup2
REFORM AND IN THE NINETIES.

00:38:12.123 --> 00:38:19.731 region:rollup2
THIS ASSAY NOT ACCOUNTED --

00:38:16.728 --> 00:38:20.298 region:rollup2
FOR BUT TO OUR KNOWLEDGE WE

00:38:19.731 --> 00:38:21.699 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK THAT THAT WOULD

00:38:20.298 --> 00:38:23.968 region:rollup2
HAPPEN.

00:38:21.699 --> 00:38:25.503 region:rollup2
OKAY SO IF A COUNTY THESE ARE

00:38:23.968 --> 00:38:26.571 region:rollup2
SELF REPORTED NUMBERS THERE'S NO

00:38:25.503 --> 00:38:27.505 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION SO FOR

00:38:26.571 --> 00:38:29.107 region:rollup2
COUNTY.

00:38:27.505 --> 00:38:30.675 region:rollup2
IN ADMINISTERING CAL WORKS

00:38:29.107 --> 00:38:31.776 region:rollup2
WANTED TO CONTEST SOMETHING THAT

00:38:30.675 --> 00:38:34.045 region:rollup2
WAS REPORTED HOW WOULD THEY GO

00:38:31.776 --> 00:38:35.947 region:rollup2
ABOUT DOING THAT.

00:38:34.045 --> 00:38:37.615 region:rollup2
MY CORPORATE GUY THE LOCALS GOOD

00:38:35.947 --> 00:38:39.450 region:rollup2
IS A BETWEEN ECOLOGY OR TO

00:38:37.615 --> 00:38:40.852 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT THOSE INFORMATIONS

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:41.419 region:rollup2
THAT PROVIDER ACCURATE.

00:38:40.852 --> 00:38:43.154 region:rollup2
I MEAN HOW WHAT THE COLLEGE

00:38:41.419 --> 00:38:44.856 region:rollup2
NOTES SELF REPORTED BY THE

00:38:43.154 --> 00:38:46.157 region:rollup2
RECIPIENT.

00:38:44.856 --> 00:38:47.759 region:rollup2
I I THINK THE KEY THING IS THAT

00:38:46.157 --> 00:38:50.128 region:rollup2
THIS IS YOU KNOW BUILT ON TRUST

00:38:47.759 --> 00:38:50.328 region:rollup2
AND THAT THE CALVET INDIVIDUALS

00:38:50.128 --> 00:38:53.231 region:rollup2
WOULD.

00:38:50.328 --> 00:38:54.732 region:rollup2
DO IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR OTHER

00:38:53.231 --> 00:38:55.867 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO ENSURE THAT YOU KNOW

00:38:54.732 --> 00:38:58.203 region:rollup2
ALL THE HOURS THAT THERE.

00:38:55.867 --> 00:38:59.871 region:rollup2
USING A STUDY.

00:38:58.203 --> 00:39:01.739 region:rollup2
SHOULD WE CAN FOR AND PLUS AT

00:38:59.871 --> 00:39:03.508 region:rollup2
BUT BUT THEN THE DAY THERE'S

00:39:01.739 --> 00:39:05.410 region:rollup2
ONLY A MAXIMUM BOWERS TO SHOULD

00:39:03.508 --> 00:39:07.011 region:rollup2
BE ACCOUNT FOR OVER THERE.

00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:07.579 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT LIKE A REFINEMENT

00:39:07.011 --> 00:39:09.981 region:rollup2
CORRECTLY IT'S A THREE HOURS

00:39:07.579 --> 00:39:11.683 region:rollup2
ONLY. FOR PER CLASSES SO IT'S

00:39:09.981 --> 00:39:13.084 region:rollup2
NOT LIKE IT'S A WIDE RANGE OF

00:39:11.683 --> 00:39:14.719 region:rollup2
HOURS THAT YOU KNOW --

00:39:13.084 --> 00:39:16.187 region:rollup2
ANYBODY COULD ACCOUNT.

00:39:14.719 --> 00:39:16.955 region:rollup2
FOR OKAY LEVEL LARGER CONCERN

00:39:16.187 --> 00:39:18.890 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS --

00:39:16.955 --> 00:39:20.391 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT PUBLIC PERCEPTION

00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:21.192 region:rollup2
OF CAL WORKS IS VERY IMPORTANT

00:39:20.391 --> 00:39:22.627 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THIS HAS THE

00:39:21.192 --> 00:39:23.995 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL TO UNDERMINE THE

00:39:22.627 --> 00:39:25.897 region:rollup2
PUBLIC'S TRUST AND CAL WORKS

00:39:23.995 --> 00:39:27.465 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO

00:39:25.897 --> 00:39:29.567 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY INCREASING FRAUD --

00:39:27.465 --> 00:39:31.135 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO VERIFY SO I

00:39:29.567 --> 00:39:32.470 region:rollup2
THAT I REAL PROBLEM WITH THAT

00:39:31.135 --> 00:39:32.770 region:rollup2
PART OF THE TRAILER BILL

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:35.340 region:rollup2

LOT OF FOLKS.

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:49.320 region:rollup2
MY QUESTION MORE SHOW IS YOU

I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT HOURS

00:41:05.029 --> 00:41:08.066 region:rollup2
THAT ARE YOU THAT COULD BE

00:41:06.764 --> 00:41:09.801 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTED FOR THIS A FINER

00:41:08.066 --> 00:41:11.836 region:rollup2
CORRECTLY IT'S NOT LIKE THAT

00:41:09.801 --> 00:41:13.771 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S ONLY THREE HOURS SO

00:41:11.836 --> 00:41:13.972 region:rollup2
FOR PER CLASSES BUT OUT THE COME

00:41:13.771 --> 00:41:15.273 region:rollup2

NOW GET YOUR STAFF THE PROPER

00:41:15.273 --> 00:41:18.676 region:rollup2
INFORMATION --

00:41:17.108 --> 00:41:20.311 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE.

00:41:18.676 --> 00:41:22.981 region:rollup2
IT'S ON AS THOUGH ANYBODY COULD

00:41:20.311 --> 00:41:24.949 region:rollup2
TO SAY THAT I'VE DONE AND OUR

00:41:22.981 --> 00:41:26.718 region:rollup2
TEN HOURS WORTH OF PER WEEK FOR

00:41:24.949 --> 00:41:28.486 region:rollup2
UPPER CLASS THERE IS THE LIMIT

00:41:26.718 --> 00:41:28.953 region:rollup2
THAT THEY COULD BE ACCOUNT

00:41:28.486 --> 00:41:29.554 region:rollup2
TOWARD.

00:41:28.953 --> 00:41:32.590 region:rollup2
THEIR WORK AROUND WHAT PLANTS

00:41:29.554 --> 00:41:33.691 region:rollup2
SO.

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:34.826 region:rollup2
BUT THEN THE DAY THERE IS A

00:41:33.691 --> 00:41:35.893 region:rollup2
LIMIT NOBODY CAN GO UP THERE AND

00:41:34.826 --> 00:41:37.395 region:rollup2
SAY THAT --

00:41:35.893 --> 00:41:39.063 region:rollup2
THIS WHOLE WEEK I SPENT YOU KNOW

00:41:37.395 --> 00:41:40.798 region:rollup2
BURKE AND STUDY JUST FOR THIS

00:41:39.063 --> 00:41:41.999 region:rollup2
CLASS AND THERE'S A MAXIMUM

00:41:40.798 --> 00:41:43.434 region:rollup2
HOURS I COULD BE COUNT WITH A

00:41:41.999 --> 00:41:44.769 region:rollup2
WORK PLAN AYE I BRING IT UP

00:41:43.434 --> 00:41:46.671 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT I MEAN THERE WE WE

00:41:44.769 --> 00:41:49.607 region:rollup2
HAVE A SOLID WAY OF COUNTING.

00:41:46.671 --> 00:41:50.608 region:rollup2
HOURS PER CREDIT IN AND HOW MUCH

00:41:49.607 --> 00:41:53.878 region:rollup2
HOMEWORK IS ASSIGNED TO THAT.

00:41:50.608 --> 00:41:54.946 region:rollup2
SO A AS A STATE IT JUST RAISES

00:41:53.878 --> 00:41:56.981 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION WHY WE ARE LOOKING

00:41:54.946 --> 00:41:58.583 region:rollup2
AT YOU KNOW IF IF A STUDENT

00:41:56.981 --> 00:42:01.085 region:rollup2
TAKING SO MANY CREDITS.

00:41:58.583 --> 00:42:02.920 region:rollup2
THOSE CREDITS WERE EQUAL TO A

00:42:01.085 --> 00:42:04.622 region:rollup2
CERTAIN NUMBER OF HOURS.

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:05.823 region:rollup2
SO WHY WOULD WE BE BASED ON A

00:42:04.622 --> 00:42:06.891 region:rollup2
SYSTEM OFF OF SOMETHING THAT WE

00:42:05.823 --> 00:42:09.327 region:rollup2
KNOW.

00:42:06.891 --> 00:42:11.896 region:rollup2
IT OUR RD HAS AN EQUATION VERSES

00:42:09.327 --> 00:42:12.830 region:rollup2
A SELF REPORTING BACK.

00:42:11.896 --> 00:42:14.432 region:rollup2
THAT WAY THERE'S CLARITY IN

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:15.566 region:rollup2
THERE THEN THERE IS A CONCERN

00:42:14.432 --> 00:42:17.268 region:rollup2
FOR FRAUD.

00:42:15.566 --> 00:42:19.370 region:rollup2
THAN WE ALREADY HAVE IT BASED

00:42:17.268 --> 00:42:19.971 region:rollup2
AND AND THAT WITH OUR STUDENTS

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:20.571 region:rollup2
ARE ACTUALLY GETTING THE FULL

00:42:19.971 --> 00:42:22.740 region:rollup2
HOURS.

00:42:20.571 --> 00:42:24.008 region:rollup2
THEY SHOULD BE GETTING OF FOR

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:25.676 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM VERSES --

00:42:24.008 --> 00:42:26.511 region:rollup2
ELIMINATES LIKE YOU SAID THREE

00:42:25.676 --> 00:42:27.712 region:rollup2
HOURS.

00:42:26.511 --> 00:42:28.780 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THREE HOURS FOR ONE

00:42:27.712 --> 00:42:31.916 region:rollup2
CLASS IS DIFFERENT THAN THREE

00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:32.917 region:rollup2
HOURS FOR ANOTHER CLASS.

00:42:31.916 --> 00:42:35.386 region:rollup2
LET ME THAT SOMETHING THAT WOULD

00:42:32.917 --> 00:42:36.854 region:rollup2
LOOK INTO AS FOR IMPLEMENTING US

00:42:35.386 --> 00:42:38.189 region:rollup2
WITH THE COUNTY AS YOU KNOW WITH

00:42:36.854 --> 00:42:39.123 region:rollup2
PARTS OF RESOURCES AND CONCERNS

00:42:38.189 --> 00:42:39.824 region:rollup2
IT'S MY AMP.

00:42:39.123 --> 00:42:41.459 region:rollup2
TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT YEAH YEAH

00:42:39.824 --> 00:42:42.727 region:rollup2
IT IS AUTOMATICALLY BRINGS OF

00:42:41.459 --> 00:42:44.796 region:rollup2
THE CONCERN THAT YOU KNOW NEXT

00:42:42.727 --> 00:42:46.097 region:rollup2
RIGHT AFTER AND CLEAN UP

00:42:44.796 --> 00:42:47.064 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE TO FIX THIS.

00:42:46.097 --> 00:42:48.332 region:rollup2
SO YOU KNOW MY AND MY OTHER

00:42:47.064 --> 00:42:51.102 region:rollup2
CONCERN TO USE EXCESSIVE MY

00:42:48.332 --> 00:42:52.970 region:rollup2
DISTRICT AND WE'RE WE'RE A 56%

00:42:51.102 --> 00:42:54.705 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:55.573 region:rollup2
ARE ALSO USING CAL WORKS OF

00:42:54.705 --> 00:42:56.407 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT TO TO GIVE AYE

00:42:55.573 --> 00:42:58.276 region:rollup2
AND BETTER THEMSELVES.

00:42:56.407 --> 00:42:59.744 region:rollup2
SO YOU KNOW TO MAKE SURE MY

00:42:58.276 --> 00:43:00.778 region:rollup2

THE DESERVE.

00:43:00.778 --> 00:43:03.114 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO YOU KNOW WE HAVE

00:43:02.814 --> 00:43:05.850 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:43:03.114 --> 00:43:06.851 region:rollup2
THAT HALF CAN.

00:43:05.850 --> 00:43:07.485 region:rollup2
FRAUD BY BASING IT OFF OF THE

00:43:06.851 --> 00:43:10.688 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

00:43:07.485 --> 00:43:12.457 region:rollup2
THE TARDY THERE.

00:43:10.688 --> 00:43:14.258 region:rollup2
I IN OF A CHARACTER'S PERMANENT

00:43:12.457 --> 00:43:15.693 region:rollup2
SUPPOSED TO HELP FOLKS BECOME

00:43:14.258 --> 00:43:17.428 region:rollup2
SELF SUFFICIENT AND AT AN

00:43:15.693 --> 00:43:18.996 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTE I'VE A LOT OF FRIENDS

00:43:17.428 --> 00:43:20.465 region:rollup2
AND FAMILY THEY'VE USED IT.

00:43:18.996 --> 00:43:22.200 region:rollup2
WHICH IS WHY MY CONCERN IN THIS

00:43:20.465 --> 00:43:23.067 region:rollup2
IS WHERE WE MAKING SURE THEY'RE

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:24.569 region:rollup2
GETTING THE HOURS THAT THEIR DO

00:43:23.067 --> 00:43:26.437 region:rollup2
VERSES.

00:43:24.569 --> 00:43:27.004 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SOME SELF REPORTING

00:43:26.437 --> 00:43:28.873 region:rollup2
MECHANISM THIS IS GONNA COST

00:43:27.004 --> 00:43:30.074 region:rollup2
TURMOIL.

00:43:28.873 --> 00:43:31.309 region:rollup2
AND LIKE THE WE COULD DEFINITELY

00:43:30.074 --> 00:43:33.077 region:rollup2
DO THAT INTO ACCOUNT AS WERE

00:43:31.309 --> 00:43:34.579 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED.

00:43:33.077 --> 00:43:36.280 region:rollup2
SEE HOW THAT GOES.

00:43:34.579 --> 00:43:39.050 region:rollup2
I I GUESS I'M.

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:40.418 region:rollup2
CONFUSED BY THE COMMITTEE

00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:41.786 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE

00:43:40.418 --> 00:43:43.554 region:rollup2
WHETHER.

00:43:41.786 --> 00:43:45.156 region:rollup2
YOU'RE ADVOCATING FOR MAKING IT

00:43:43.554 --> 00:43:47.692 region:rollup2
HARDER ARE MAKING IT.

00:43:45.156 --> 00:43:48.493 region:rollup2
EASIER SO YOUR CONSTITUENTS WITH

00:43:47.692 --> 00:43:50.361 region:rollup2
SO MISTER CHAIR I I WANNA MAKE

00:43:48.493 --> 00:43:51.229 region:rollup2
SURE IT'S EASIER BECAUSE IF IF

00:43:50.361 --> 00:43:53.531 region:rollup2
YOU'RE TAKING CREDITS THOSE

00:43:51.229 --> 00:43:55.867 region:rollup2
CREDITS.

00:43:53.531 --> 00:43:57.735 region:rollup2
COMBINED HOW MUCH CLASSROOM

00:43:55.867 --> 00:43:59.437 region:rollup2
HOURS AND HOMEWORK OUT.

00:43:57.735 --> 00:44:01.439 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS NOW

00:43:59.437 --> 00:44:03.374 region:rollup2
IT'S GONNA BE SELF REPORTING.

00:44:01.439 --> 00:44:04.675 region:rollup2
SO WHY ARE WE JUST GIVEN A

00:44:03.374 --> 00:44:06.410 region:rollup2
STUDENTS THE HOURS FOR THEIR

00:44:04.675 --> 00:44:07.445 region:rollup2
CREDITS.

00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:08.880 region:rollup2
BECAUSE SOME OF THAT GOES INTO

00:44:07.445 --> 00:44:09.914 region:rollup2
THEIR HOME.

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:12.250 region:rollup2
SO WE'REGONNA BASED OFF OF

00:44:09.914 --> 00:44:13.951 region:rollup2
THEIR HOMEWORK.

00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:15.419 region:rollup2
IT MAY BE DOCTOR WHATEVER.

00:44:13.951 --> 00:44:17.855 region:rollup2
OR FROM.

00:44:15.419 --> 00:44:19.290 region:rollup2
MR MEDINA CAN HELP WITH THIS.

00:44:17.855 --> 00:44:20.858 region:rollup2
WHY IT YOU WOULD THINK WE WOULD

00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:22.927 region:rollup2
BE SETTING UP A SYSTEM?

00:44:20.858 --> 00:44:23.494 region:rollup2
GUARANTEEING THEM THE HOURS THAT

00:44:22.927 --> 00:44:24.162 region:rollup2
THEY'RE ACTUALLY GETTING FOR

00:44:23.494 --> 00:44:26.464 region:rollup2
THEIR CREDIT [inaudible]

00:44:24.162 --> 00:44:29.333 region:rollup2
VERSES.

00:44:26.464 --> 00:44:30.902 region:rollup2
LIMITING THEM TO TO THREE HOURS

00:44:29.333 --> 00:44:32.837 region:rollup2
IS IS A WRIST HOLE GOT AND I

00:44:30.902 --> 00:44:33.437 region:rollup2
THINK I THINK WE ARM.

00:44:32.837 --> 00:44:34.472 region:rollup2
AT WHY THINK WE'VE WE TOTALLY

00:44:33.437 --> 00:44:35.173 region:rollup2
AGREE WITH THAT MINDSET AND

00:44:34.472 --> 00:44:36.908 region:rollup2
TRYING TO MAKE IT MORE

00:44:35.173 --> 00:44:37.909 region:rollup2
STREAMLINED AND EASIER I THINK

00:44:36.908 --> 00:44:39.477 region:rollup2
THIS WAS THAT.

00:44:37.909 --> 00:44:42.780 region:rollup2
THE EFFORT WAS TO TRY TO MAKE IT

00:44:39.477 --> 00:44:44.282 region:rollup2
EASIER SO PER PERHAPS YOU KNOW

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:46.517 region:rollup2
FINANCE COULD JUST DON'T DO IT

00:44:44.282 --> 00:44:48.920 region:rollup2
WITH THE SELF REPORTING IS GONNA

00:44:46.517 --> 00:44:50.021 region:rollup2
AT ANOTHER.

00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:52.356 region:rollup2
WELL IF TO IT WHERE WE ON THE

00:44:50.021 --> 00:44:53.391 region:rollup2
OLD BASED UPON CREDIT ASIAN AND

00:44:52.356 --> 00:44:54.158 region:rollup2
HOW MANY HOURS THEY'RE GETTING

00:44:53.391 --> 00:44:55.092 region:rollup2
GOTTA SEE YOUR TO SEE YOUR YOUR

00:44:54.158 --> 00:44:55.860 region:rollup2
YOUR POINT IS THAT.

00:44:55.092 --> 00:44:57.628 region:rollup2
THIS APPROACH IS AUTOMATICALLY

00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:58.596 region:rollup2
GET CREDITS WITHOUTHAVING TO

00:44:57.628 --> 00:44:59.897 region:rollup2
EVEN DO THE REPORTING IS THAT

00:44:58.596 --> 00:45:01.666 region:rollup2
WELL IF IF THEY'RE TAKING THE

00:44:59.897 --> 00:45:03.901 region:rollup2
CLASSES.

00:45:01.666 --> 00:45:08.606 region:rollup2
AND WE KNOW THAT HE HAS A CLASS

00:45:03.901 --> 00:45:10.374 region:rollup2
RESIDENTS ARE PASSING WORK.

00:45:08.606 --> 00:45:11.576 region:rollup2
CREATOR HAVING WE WE KNOW HOW

00:45:10.374 --> 00:45:13.477 region:rollup2
MUCH THOSE CREDITS ARE WORTH.

00:45:11.576 --> 00:45:14.312 region:rollup2
HOW MANY HOURS GOING TO THAT HOW

00:45:13.477 --> 00:45:15.112 region:rollup2
MANY HOME WORK HOURS GOING TO

00:45:14.312 --> 00:45:16.614 region:rollup2
THAT?

00:45:15.112 --> 00:45:19.550 region:rollup2
WOULD ONLY MAKE SENSE THAT WE

00:45:16.614 --> 00:45:20.651 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE A SOLID SYSTEM VERSES

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:22.753 region:rollup2
NOW THEY HAVE TO DO ONE MORE

00:45:20.651 --> 00:45:24.155 region:rollup2
STEP IN GOING TO SELF REPORTING.

00:45:22.753 --> 00:45:25.189 region:rollup2
ALL THE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE

00:45:24.155 --> 00:45:26.324 region:rollup2
DOING CAL WORKS ARE.

00:45:25.189 --> 00:45:27.992 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THEM ARE.

00:45:26.324 --> 00:45:29.227 region:rollup2
WORKING A PART TIME JOB THEY'RE

00:45:27.992 --> 00:45:30.194 region:rollup2
GOING TO SCHOOL THE TRANSIT CARE

00:45:29.227 --> 00:45:31.495 region:rollup2
THEIR KIDS TRYING TO BETTER

00:45:30.194 --> 00:45:32.730 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES SO NOW WE'RE GONNA

00:45:31.495 --> 00:45:34.732 region:rollup2
ONE MORE BURDEN ON THEM.

00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:36.300 region:rollup2
WHEN WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT THE

00:45:34.732 --> 00:45:37.868 region:rollup2
CREDIT ASIAN HOURS ALL?

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:39.604 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S A FAIR POINT AYE

00:45:37.868 --> 00:45:41.973 region:rollup2
AYE YEAH I THINK THIS IS AN

00:45:39.604 --> 00:45:42.740 region:rollup2
INTENT TO PLACE ANY BURNING ON

00:45:41.973 --> 00:45:43.975 region:rollup2
ANY OF THE CAPITA CHIP AND

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:44.542 region:rollup2
OVERALL WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE

00:45:43.975 --> 00:45:46.544 region:rollup2
SURE THAT.

00:45:44.542 --> 00:45:49.013 region:rollup2
NO OF THE HOURS THAT THERE ARE

00:45:46.544 --> 00:45:51.415 region:rollup2
BEING ACCOUNTED FOR AND THE PARK

00:45:49.013 --> 00:45:54.251 region:rollup2
PLAN SO THAT IT GIVES THEM MORE.

00:45:51.415 --> 00:45:55.620 region:rollup2
HOURS AND FOR PURPOSES OF YOU

00:45:54.251 --> 00:45:57.421 region:rollup2
KNOW DON'T WANT WELFARE TO WORK

00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:59.724 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES AN ACCOUNT FOR THAT

00:45:57.421 --> 00:46:01.559 region:rollup2
SO IT'S THEN INTENT BY MINOR

00:45:59.724 --> 00:46:03.461 region:rollup2
SENATE SITES KNOWNMEANS.

00:46:01.559 --> 00:46:04.729 region:rollup2
TO MAKE IT MORE COMPLICATED FOR

00:46:03.461 --> 00:46:07.865 region:rollup2
THE ACCOUNT WHICH RECIPIENT YEAH

00:46:04.729 --> 00:46:08.499 region:rollup2
THAT WILL THE CURRENT SYSTEM WE

00:46:07.865 --> 00:46:08.799 region:rollup2
COUNT THE HOURS IN THE CLASSROOM

00:46:08.499 --> 00:46:09.634 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:46:08.799 --> 00:46:11.202 region:rollup2
NOT.

00:46:09.634 --> 00:46:12.003 region:rollup2
WHAT THE PROBLEM SO WE NEEDED A

00:46:11.202 --> 00:46:12.970 region:rollup2
IS WE'RE DOING NEW SYSTEMS WE

00:46:12.003 --> 00:46:14.672 region:rollup2
NEED TO MAKE SURE?

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:17.241 region:rollup2
WE WENT AGAIN WE KNOW HOW MUCH

00:46:14.672 --> 00:46:18.676 region:rollup2
THE ACCREDITATION HOURS OR IN

00:46:17.241 --> 00:46:20.211 region:rollup2
THE HOMEWORK IS IN OURS ARE

00:46:18.676 --> 00:46:22.413 region:rollup2
INCLUDED INTO THAT ON AN

00:46:20.211 --> 00:46:24.248 region:rollup2
ACCREDITATION SITE. FOR FOR

00:46:22.413 --> 00:46:25.316 region:rollup2
COLLEGE CREDITS AND WITH CAL

00:46:24.248 --> 00:46:26.550 region:rollup2
WORKS ONLY GIVING THEM THE HOURS

00:46:25.316 --> 00:46:27.618 region:rollup2
IN THE CLASSROOM.

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:29.720 region:rollup2
WE ALREADY KNOW ON THE

00:46:27.618 --> 00:46:31.522 region:rollup2
ACCREDITATION SITE HOW MUCH

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:32.857 region:rollup2
HOMEWORK HOURS WERE INCLUDED.

00:46:31.522 --> 00:46:34.358 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE GOING TO BALANCE THAT

00:46:32.857 --> 00:46:35.459 region:rollup2
OUT ON THE CAL WORKS SIDE WHERE

00:46:34.358 --> 00:46:36.627 region:rollup2
WE JUST TAKE A NUMBER FROM THE

00:46:35.459 --> 00:46:38.996 region:rollup2
ACCREDITATION CITING GIVEN NOT

00:46:36.627 --> 00:46:39.630 region:rollup2
TO THE VERSES A SELF REPORTING

00:46:38.996 --> 00:46:41.098 region:rollup2
MECHANISM.

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:43.968 region:rollup2
IT'S GOING [inaudible]

00:46:41.098 --> 00:46:44.635 region:rollup2
TO CREATE QUESTIONS.

00:46:43.968 --> 00:46:45.303 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A LOT OF

00:46:44.635 --> 00:46:47.872 region:rollup2
WORK WE DO HERE.

00:46:45.303 --> 00:46:49.206 region:rollup2
AYE I THINK IT'S A GREAT POINT

00:46:47.872 --> 00:46:51.008 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT

00:46:49.206 --> 00:46:52.710 region:rollup2
WE WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT AND

00:46:51.008 --> 00:46:55.479 region:rollup2
SOMEONE AGAIN NEXT YEAR I THINK

00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:56.314 region:rollup2
FAIR FAIR POINT.

00:46:55.479 --> 00:47:00.117 region:rollup2
