AUTHOR FOR THIS BILL THIS. IS

00:31:13.972 --> 00:31:15.440
YOU CAN TELL FROM THE ANALYSIS

00:31:15.506 --> 00:31:17.208
I SERVED ON THIS CONSERVANCY

00:31:17.275 --> 00:31:18.676
BOARD FOR EIGHT YEARS AND THERE

00:31:18.743 --> 00:31:20.445
BEEN SOME CONTENTIOUS ISSUES

00:31:20.511 --> 00:31:22.013
AND SOME ISSUES ABOUT

ADDRESSING WITH THIS BILL. IN

00:31:26.451 --> 00:31:27.385
THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN ONE KEY

00:31:27.452 --> 00:31:28.987
THING ABOUT GOVERNMENTS FOR

00:31:29.053 --> 00:31:31.789
CONSERVANCY SWITCHES. FROM THE

00:31:31.856 --> 00:31:33.591
STATE SIDE TO TRY TO HAVE AT

00:31:33.658 --> 00:31:34.993
LEAST ONE MORE MEMBER.

00:31:35.059 --> 00:31:37.562
APPOINTED BY STATE OFFICIALS

00:31:37.629 --> 00:31:38.863
THAT LOCAL AS IT'S A STATE

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:40.698
AGENCY AT THIS BILL HONOR

00:31:40.765 --> 00:31:42.967
STATUS WITHIN THE EXPANSION SO

00:31:43.034 --> 00:31:44.902
IT'S GOOD THE ONE QUESTION I

00:31:44.969 --> 00:31:47.472
HAD IS A TRIBAL REPRESENTATIVE

00:31:47.538 --> 00:31:50.008
HE SAID BY THIS BILL THAT IS A

00:31:50.074 --> 00:31:52.677
GOOD THING AND- AS I UNDERSTAND

00:31:52.744 --> 00:31:53.478
IT THERE'S FOUR DIFFERENT

00:31:53.544 --> 00:31:55.280
TRIBES THAT MIGHT BE IN THE

00:31:55.346 --> 00:31:57.515
REGION THAT WOULD QUALIFY FOR

00:31:57.582 --> 00:31:59.217
MEMBERSHIP. AND IT JUST SAYS

00:31:59.284 --> 00:32:01.219
THE GOVERNOR WILL CHOOSE FROM A

00:32:01.286 --> 00:32:05.290
LIST. AND I'M WONDERING. HE

00:32:05.356 --> 00:32:06.391
THAT PUTS THE GOVERNOR IN A

00:32:06.457 --> 00:32:08.226
ROUGH BEHIND AND TO SOMEBODY

00:32:08.293 --> 00:32:09.527
GETS APPOINTED FROM ONE TRIBE

00:32:09.594 --> 00:32:10.995
AT THE NOT TRUCK JUST GETS TO

00:32:11.062 --> 00:32:13.364
REPRESENTATION FOR A LONG TIME

00:32:13.431 --> 00:32:15.633
AND THERE'S NO ROTATION. I

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:16.668
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER TO

00:32:16.734 --> 00:32:17.902
MY QUESTION IS BUT I'M

00:32:17.969 --> 00:32:19.203
WONDERING IF THERE IS A BETTER

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:21.873
WAY TO ENSURE A ROTATION OR- OR

00:32:21.939 --> 00:32:23.341
SOME PARTICIPATION AMONG THE

00:32:23.408 --> 00:32:24.842
DIFFERENT TRIBES AND I DON'T

00:32:24.909 --> 00:32:25.977
KNOW IF IT'S A FIXED TERM

00:32:26.044 --> 00:32:27.612
INVENTED. DEFAULTS TO SOMEBODY

00:32:27.679 --> 00:32:29.681
ELSE OR OR WHATEVER HAVE YOU

00:32:29.747 --> 00:32:32.350
GIVEN THOUGHT TO THAT ISSUE AND

00:32:32.417 --> 00:32:33.551
HOW YOU'RE DOING THIS BILL.

00:32:33.618 --> 00:32:35.019
FIRST THE THANK YOU SENATOR FOR

00:32:35.086 --> 00:32:37.021
THE QUESTION AND I DO BELIEVE

00:32:37.088 --> 00:32:39.824
IT'S- FIVE TOTAL TRIBAL BALCONY

00:32:39.891 --> 00:32:40.792
NINETY THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED

00:32:40.858 --> 00:32:42.193
BETWEEN FRESNO AND MADERA

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:44.362
COUNTY. AND DO THINK IT IS

00:32:44.429 --> 00:32:45.897
NECESSARY FOR US TO HAVE

00:32:45.963 --> 00:32:47.198
TRANSITIONS BETWEEN THE

00:32:47.265 --> 00:32:48.700
REPRESENTATIONS BETWEEN THE

00:32:48.766 --> 00:32:50.601
TRIBAL NATIONS. BUT WOULD LIKE

00:32:50.668 --> 00:32:51.803
THE ORIGINAL STEWARDS OF THE

00:32:51.869 --> 00:32:53.071
LAND STYLE ALSO HAVE AN

00:32:53.137 --> 00:32:54.639
OPPORTUNITY TO SHAPE WHAT THE

00:32:54.706 --> 00:32:57.208
RIVER LOOKS LIKE. AND WITHOUT

00:32:57.275 --> 00:32:58.943
PUTTING A SPECIFIC TERM ON IT

00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:00.278
WOULD HOPE THAT THE TRIBAL

00:33:00.345 --> 00:33:02.613
NATIONS WOULD SEE THIS. SEAT AS

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:03.981
AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE

00:33:04.048 --> 00:33:06.484
EDUCATION ABOUT. WHAT OCCURRED

00:33:06.551 --> 00:33:10.988
ON THEIR NATIVE LAND SO LONG

00:33:11.055 --> 00:33:12.924
BEFORE THE CONSERVANCY BEGAN.

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:14.859
OKAY I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE

00:33:14.926 --> 00:33:16.794
TRYING TO DO BUT- THAT JUST

00:33:16.861 --> 00:33:18.496
HAPPENED GIVE IT SOME THOUGHT

00:33:18.563 --> 00:33:20.231
BECAUSE THEN THEY'LL BE A BILL

00:33:20.298 --> 00:33:21.432
BACK IN FRONT OF THE SINCE SIX

00:33:21.499 --> 00:33:22.700
YEARS BECAUSE IT'S BEEN ONE

00:33:22.767 --> 00:33:24.369
TRIBE THE OTHERS HAVE SCREAMED.

00:33:24.435 --> 00:33:25.603
AND SCREAMED OUT EVERYBODY'S

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:27.605
CRAZED ABOUT IT AND SO JUST

00:33:27.672 --> 00:33:28.773
GIVE IT SOME THOUGHT AS YOU

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.375

RESPOND TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS

00:33:40.718 --> 00:33:43.421

ACCESS AND EQUITY IN A LOT FOR

00:33:58.836 --> 00:34:00.438
THE COMMUNITY I THINK. THAT

00:34:00.505 --> 00:34:02.540
KIND OF LOCAL VOICE EVEN IF IT

00:34:02.607 --> 00:34:04.542

TO ELEVATE HERE SO- I DON'T

00:34:13.284 --> 00:34:15.386
SEE. THAT APPOINTMENT PROCESS

00:34:15.453 --> 00:34:18.389
IS NEGATING THE LOCAL IMPACT-

00:34:18.456 --> 00:34:21.259
OR- AGENCY THAT THAT THEY WOULD

00:34:21.325 --> 00:34:22.593

AS HE CENTER LAYERED. BUT JUST

01:29:02.804 --> 01:29:06.174
A OF A COMMON QUESTION AND- THE

01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:08.676
COMMENT IS TO IT. FOR TEN YEARS

01:29:08.743 --> 01:29:10.745
MY ADVICE TO HOLD SECESSION

01:29:10.812 --> 01:29:12.380
SUCCESSION OF LEGISLATORS IS

01:29:12.447 --> 01:29:13.815
THAT THE WAY TO SUCCESSFULLY

01:29:13.881 --> 01:29:15.850
ACCOMPLISH THIS. IS TO BUY OUT

01:29:15.917 --> 01:29:17.885
DEAL WHICH FEE FUND AND THAT'S

01:29:17.952 --> 01:29:18.986
WHAT THE SEPARATE DOLLARS AND

01:29:19.053 --> 01:29:20.855
THAT. MAKES TOTAL SENSE MY

01:29:20.922 --> 01:29:23.424
QUESTION IS THAT WE PASSED OUT

01:29:23.491 --> 01:29:24.992
A BILL BY SENATOR GLAZERS

01:29:25.059 --> 01:29:26.661
EARLIER IN THE SESSION THAT WAS

01:29:26.728 --> 01:29:28.830
SIMILAR. AND THERE'S A BUDGET

01:29:28.896 --> 01:29:31.632
REQUEST FOR THIS THAT IS

01:29:31.699 --> 01:29:34.102
DIFFERENT TELL US. HOW ALL

01:29:34.168 --> 01:29:35.269
THREE OF THESE FIT TOGETHER AND

01:29:35.336 --> 01:29:37.905
WHAT THE STATUSES. YES AT MY

01:29:37.972 --> 01:29:39.173
UNDERSTANDING ALTHOUGH I DON'T

01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:39.774
LIKE TO SPEAK FOR THE

01:29:39.841 --> 01:29:40.942
LEGISLATORS THE SENATOR GLAZERS

01:29:41.008 --> 01:29:42.610
LEGISLATION IS NOT MOVING AT

01:29:42.677 --> 01:29:44.479
THIS TIME SO THIS IS THE ONLY

01:29:44.545 --> 01:29:45.113
PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT

01:29:45.179 --> 01:29:48.649
REMAINS MOVING. AND YES

01:29:48.716 --> 01:29:50.017
ALTHOUGH THE BUDGET SEEMS LIKE

01:29:50.084 --> 01:29:51.719
A PERFECTLY REASONABLE PLACE TO

01:29:51.786 --> 01:29:53.855
DO THIS EXCHANGE. WE ARE DOING

01:29:53.921 --> 01:29:54.522
IT THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE

01:29:54.589 --> 01:29:55.857
PROCESS AT THIS TIME MEDINA IS

01:29:55.923 --> 01:29:57.592

WAS I THE ASSEMBLY. BUT TO

01:30:34.662 --> 01:30:36.497
CONCERNS PARTICULARLY ON THIS

01:30:36.564 --> 01:30:38.332
BILL REGARDING THE NINE MILLION

01:30:38.399 --> 01:30:41.202
DOLLARS. ONE IS IT DIRECTS

01:30:41.269 --> 01:30:43.171
PARKS TO GET THE NINE MILLION

01:30:43.237 --> 01:30:44.939
DOLLARS BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY.

01:30:45.006 --> 01:30:47.775
PRESENT A SOLID GUARANTEE. THAT

01:30:47.842 --> 01:30:49.310
THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN SO I JUST

01:30:49.377 --> 01:30:51.479
WANT YOU COULD SPEAK TO THAT-

01:30:51.546 --> 01:30:53.881
AND THEN NINE MILLION DOLLARS

01:30:53.948 --> 01:30:54.482
IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT JUST

01:30:54.549 --> 01:30:57.151
ON. ST INFLATION IS WORTH

01:30:57.218 --> 01:30:58.319
FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS- ONE OF

01:30:58.386 --> 01:31:02.690
THE- OPPONENTS SPOKE ABOUT

01:31:02.757 --> 01:31:03.891
FIFTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS I

01:31:03.958 --> 01:31:05.893
DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT LAND

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:07.361
IS DONE AND I'M SURE IT'S GONNA

01:31:07.428 --> 01:31:09.063
WELL I KNOW IT'S KIND OF A LOT

01:31:09.130 --> 01:31:11.265
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HOW MUCH BUT

01:31:11.332 --> 01:31:13.234
IT. CERTAINLY BE TO SOMEWHERE

01:31:13.301 --> 01:31:15.469
BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND FIFTY FOUR

01:31:15.536 --> 01:31:16.871
MILLION DOLLARS IT WOULD BE THE

01:31:16.938 --> 01:31:18.706
RIGHT NUMBER SO I JUST WANT HOW

01:31:18.773 --> 01:31:21.008
YOU. YOU KNOW HI HOW YOU

01:31:21.075 --> 01:31:22.577
ARRIVED TO THE NINE MILLION

01:31:22.643 --> 01:31:25.580
DOLLARS WITHOUT. YOU KNOW I

01:31:25.646 --> 01:31:27.181
COUNTING FOR INFLATION OR

01:31:27.248 --> 01:31:29.584
GROWTH OF THE LAND VALUE YES

01:31:29.650 --> 01:31:30.952
SELAHATTIN HAVE INTEREST BOTH

01:31:31.018 --> 01:31:32.019
THOSE QUESTIONS CENTER THANK

01:31:32.086 --> 01:31:33.588
YOU SO THE FIRST ONE IS THE

01:31:33.654 --> 01:31:34.755
BILL SAYS THAT IT WILL BE

01:31:34.822 --> 01:31:35.957
PRESERVED ONCE THE MONEY IS

01:31:36.023 --> 01:31:37.358
RECEIVED SO I THINK THAT

01:31:37.425 --> 01:31:38.659
GUARANTEES THAT IF THE MONEY'S

01:31:38.726 --> 01:31:40.127
NOT RECEIVED THE LAND WILL NOT

01:31:40.194 --> 01:31:41.696
BE PRESERVED IN PERPETUITY SO

01:31:41.762 --> 01:31:42.530
HOPEFULLY THAT ADDRESSES YOUR

01:31:42.597 --> 01:31:44.098
FIRST CONCERN AS FOR YOUR

01:31:44.165 --> 01:31:46.500
SECOND CONCERN- WE ACTUALLY

01:31:46.567 --> 01:31:48.102
HAVE THE BENEFIT OF A RECENT

01:31:48.169 --> 01:31:52.139
LANDS- FOR SALE JUST SOUTH AND

01:31:52.206 --> 01:31:54.575
ADJACENT TO. THIS LAND TO THE

01:31:54.642 --> 01:31:55.643
M. THREE PROPERTY WENT ON THE

01:31:55.710 --> 01:31:57.411
MARKET AND HAS BEEN ACTUALLY

01:31:57.478 --> 01:31:59.547
JUST HAD AN OFFER PUT ON IT AND

01:31:59.614 --> 01:32:00.615
THAT LAND WHICH IS VERY SIMILAR

01:32:00.681 --> 01:32:02.350
IN NATURE SO THIS PLAN IS NOT

01:32:02.416 --> 01:32:05.653
AVAILABLE IN FACT ALAMEDA

01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:07.088
COUNTY PASSED A- PROPOSITION.

01:32:07.154 --> 01:32:08.055
SAID THAT YOU COULD NOT DEVELOP

01:32:08.122 --> 01:32:09.257
THIS LAND SO IT DOES NOT HAVE

01:32:09.323 --> 01:32:11.158
THE SAME VALUE AS YOUR TYPICAL

01:32:11.225 --> 01:32:13.694
EVEN LAND IN LIVERMORE- AND SO

01:32:13.761 --> 01:32:15.596
IT DOES NOT HAVE WHAT I THINK.

01:32:15.663 --> 01:32:16.430
THE VALUE THAT IS BEING

01:32:16.497 --> 01:32:17.665
PROPOSED BY THE OPPOSITION AND

01:32:17.732 --> 01:32:19.300
IN FACT. AND THREE WHICH WAS

01:32:19.367 --> 01:32:20.902
APPRAISED APPRAISED AT ONE

01:32:20.968 --> 01:32:22.770
THOUSAND DOLLARS AN ACRE. AND

01:32:22.837 --> 01:32:24.272
IF YOU WERE TO DO THE MATH ON

01:32:24.338 --> 01:32:25.439
THIS LAND AT THAT WOULD BE

01:32:25.506 --> 01:32:26.474
THREE MILLION DOLLARS SO IN

01:32:26.540 --> 01:32:29.043
FACT. BASED ON THAT APPRAISAL I

01:32:29.110 --> 01:32:30.711
BELIEVE THE NINE MILLION

01:32:30.778 --> 01:32:32.346
DOLLARS IS GENEROUS. BUT

01:32:32.413 --> 01:32:33.281
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT

01:32:33.347 --> 01:32:34.715
DOESN'T HAVE A FIFTY MILLION

01:32:34.782 --> 01:32:37.585
DOLLAR VALUE. ON THE END THREE.

01:32:37.652 --> 01:32:39.086
PROPERTY WHICH IS FIFTY MILLION

01:32:39.153 --> 01:32:41.222
ACRES A FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES AS

01:32:41.289 --> 01:32:42.690
OPPOSED TO THIS THREE THOUSAND.

01:32:42.757 --> 01:32:43.591
WITH THE PRICE OF FIFTY

01:32:43.658 --> 01:32:47.094
MILLION. IT'S IN THREE IS OR IT

01:32:47.161 --> 01:32:49.664
