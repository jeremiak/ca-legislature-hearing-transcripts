AT THIS TIME AND WILL PROVIDE A FEW OPENING COMMENTS BEFORE WE BEGIN. AS WITH YESTERDAY'S HEARING I'D LIKE TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY PRIORITY GOALS REGARDING THE HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS. WE'VE WORKED COLLECTIVELY EXTREMELY HARD AS THE STATE TO RESTORE INVESTED IN AND ELEVATE OUR HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS WHICH SERVE INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES FAMILIES WHO ARE LIVING IN DEEP POVERTY CHILDREN WHO ARE IN OUR FOSTER CARE PROGRAM. AND THE AGING POPULATION WITHIN OUR STATE AMONG OTHER VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. TAKING THE PERSON CENTERED AND EQUITY ANCHORED APPROACHES TO HEART WE WANT TO FOCUS ON AND IMPROVE THE CORE SAFETY NET PROGRAMS LIKE CAL WORKS CALIFORNIA FOOD BANKS THE CONTINUUM OF CARE EFFORT SS I SS P. I. HSS AND THE REGIONAL CENTER SERVICES AMONG SO MANY OTHERS. THESE PROGRAMS NEED TO BE FULLY ABLE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE WHO THEY SERVE AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY MAY BE HAMPERED I BELIEVE IT'S A BUDGETING PRIORITY TO PROVIDE THE RESOURCES TO ENSURE THEIR BASIC FUNCTIONALITY AT WORST AND THEIR EXCELLENCE AT BEST. WHILE I'M HEARTENED BY THE MANY INVESTMENTS WHICH WERE PROPOSED IN THE MAY REVISION WE ALSO WANT TO ENSURE THAT OUR CORE PROGRAMS HAVE WHAT THEY NEED. TO BE FUNCTIONAL AND O SERVE COMMUNITIES WELL DURING THIS FRAGILE TIME. THIS IS A SENSITIVE MOMENT IN THE PANDEMIC THROUGH THE INFLATIONARY WAVES OF THE ECONOMY AND INTO A FUTURE THAT. HOLDS AN ADDITIONAL PREMIUM GIVEN THE TERRIBLE EVENTS OF LATE ON THE VALUES THAT WE HAVE TOWARDS SAFETY DECENCY AND THE PEACE WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES. WE'VE COME A LONG WAY IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HUMAN SERVICES WE KNOW MORE ABOUT RACIAL DISPARITIES AND ABOUT THE NEUROTOXICITY OF POVERTY AND THE INTERVENTIONS THAT CAN BATTLE THESE CONDITIONS WE TAKE ACTION TO ENSURE EQUALITY AND OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL PEOPLE. I AM VERY OPTIMISTIC THAT WILL COME TO A PRODUCTIVE AND MEANINGFUL MEETINGS OF THE MINDS WITH THE BUDGETING DECISIONS AHEAD I LOOK FORWARD TO LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE MAY REVISION ASK SOME KEY QUESTIONS AND TO HEAR THE INPUT FROM THE PUBLIC- WE COLLECTIVELY SERVE. THE BUDGET ACT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BELONGS TO THEM AND I WANT TO LEARN HOW THEY REACT TO WHAT THEY'VE BEEN HEARING SEEING AND LEARNING ABOUT.

HELLO COMMITTEE BURMA FINANCE NO COMMENTS AT THIS TIME BUT ANSWERING QUESTIONS THANK YOU HELLO IN THE COMMENTS JACKIE BRISTOW WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE AS WAS MENTIONED IN THE OVERVIEW PRIDE BY DEPARTMENT OF AGING ONE OF THE PROPOSALS INCLUDED AND THAT THE BUDGET AND THE MAY REVISE IS TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE pDEPARTMENT OF AGING TO ADMINISTER THE CARE SUPPORTER PROGRAM. WHICH IS ONE OF THE FLAG A FEW THINGS ONE OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THIS IS JUST ONE OF THREE PROPOSALS THAT MAKE UP THE ENTIRE CARE COURT PACKAGE SO IN TOTAL- IT WITH THOSE THREE PROPOSALS COMBINED THE ACTUAL COST FOR THE CARE COURT- PROPOSAL IS SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. ANOTHER THING THAT WE WOULD FLAG IS THAT. THE FUNDING BEING REQUESTED THROUGH THE MAY REVISION- IS TO SUPPORT. A POLICY BILL CURRENTLY MAKING ITS WAY THROUGH THE PROCESS- AND THAT KIND OF LEADS INTO JUST SOME KEY EXAMPLES OF QUESTIONS- OUR OFFICE- HAS REGARDING THE BROADER CARE COURT PROPOSAL ONE IS GETTING A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF. WHAT ACTUAL COSTS- I'M IN FUNDING NEEDS WOULD BE FOR THE CARE COURT PROGRAM GIVEN THAT ON THE POLICY IS STILL MAKING ITS WAY THROUGH THE POLICY PROCESS- UNCLEAR IF ASPECTS. WOULD CHANGE. ANOTHER QUESTION THAT WE HAVE- RELATES TO THE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE VARIOUS ENTITIES THAT WOULD- BE A PART OF THE CARE COURT PROCESS FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING. WE KNOW THAT THEIR EXPERTISE IS REALLY SERVING OLDER ADULTS AND ADULTS WITH DISABILITIES BAKER CORP POPULATION- OUR UNDERSTANDING IS MAY PRESENT UNIQUE- NEEDS THAT ARE VERY DIFFERENT AND DISTINCT FROM- THE- OLDER ADULTS ADULTS WITH DISABILITIES ARE GETTING A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF. UNNECESSARY RESOURCES AND TRAINING AND TIME IT WOULD TAKE FOR DEPARTMENT OF AGING TO DEVELOP THAT EXPERTISE IF THEY DO TAKE ON THE SUPPORTER PROGRAM- OTHER QUESTIONS ALSO INCLUDE. AN BY GETTING A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF. WHETHER THE CARE PART PROGRAM ALSO PLACE ADDITIONAL- DEMAND ON EXISTING STATE AND LOCAL PROGRAMS THAT COULD BE USED TO PROVIDE SUPPORTIVE SERVICES SUCH AS HOUSING. TO GETTING A BETTER STANDING UP HOW EXISTING- RESOURCES WOULD PLUG INTO THE CAR COURT- PROCESS. ALTOGETHER THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YEAH ENDED UP IN A FROM FINANCE- JUST WOULD NOT GIVEN. THAT THIS IS ADMINISTRATION SPONSORED LEGISLATION FOR THE CARE COURT- THE MAY REVISION DOES INCLUDE RESOURCES FOR TO STATE DEPARTMENTS AND ALSO THAT. THE JUDICIAL BRANCH- AND WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO THE EXTENT ANY- THAT'S BEEN CHANGES ARE NECESSARY NEEDED. THANK YOU WITH THE NEXT COULD WE HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES SPEAKERS FOR THE DDS MAY REVISED PROPOSALS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR HER LOOK AS THE OTHER CHIEF DEPUTY RECTOR FOR DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES OF THE MAYOR VISION INCLUDES TWELVE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE OPERATIONS AND THE- SUPPORT OF THE COMMUNITY PROGRAM- THIS SUPPORTS THE PROJECTED TO FLOODING UTILIZATION FOR APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS- IN ADDITION TO SUPPORTING HISTORY REALIZATION A NUMBER OF POLICY JUDGMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE MAY REVISION. THE FIRST OF THESE NOTED IN THE LETTER IS THE WORK FOR STABILITY PROPOSAL. THIS INCLUDES FOUR COMPONENTS- TO ADDRESS THE CURRENT AND EMERGING NEED OF THE WORK FORCE- RECOGNIZING APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY THOUSAND. ADDITIONAL CONSUMERS PER YEAR WERE ANTICIPATING A PROJECTED NEED FOR DIRECT SERVICE PROFESSIONALS AS WELL AS SERVICE COORDINATORS AT REGIONAL CENTERS. SO THE FOUR COMPONENTS INCLUDE A TRAINING STIPEND FOR THE DIRECT SERVICE PROFESSIONALS SO THIS COULD BE FOR THE NEW AS WELL AS- EXISTING. THE NEXT ITEM IS FOR AN INTERNSHIP PROGRAM THAT WOULD BE TO INCLUDE A NEW AND DIRECT SERVICE PROFESSIONALS REGIONAL CENTER SUPPORT OPERATIONS AS REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAM FOR UP ARE THE BACHELOR OR MASTER'S DEGREES. AND THEN THE LAST COMPONENT IS ALSO RECOGNIZING THE DESIRE OF CONSUMERS SOME REALLY WISH TO HAVE MORE INDEPENDENCE AND CONSUMER CHOICE. THIS WOULD BE A PILOT PER PART PROGRAM TO SUPPORT TECHNOLOGY OPTIONS. THE NEXT ITEM IN THE MAYOR VISION. IS OUR SERVICE ACCESS AND EQUITY GRANTS SO RECOGNIZING THAT THERE IS STILL AN EVALUATION UNDERWAY OF THE CURRENT PROPOSALS OF THE CURRENT GRANT PROGRAM. I'M LOKING FOR A ONE YEAR ADDITIONAL OF ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE- THIS WOULD ALSO INCLUDE SOME SUPPORT FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH- THE GRANTEES. THE NEXT ITEM IS OUR EARLY START ELIGIBILITY. AND WE'RE PROPOSING TO CHANGE THE REDUCE THE THRESHOLD FOR ELIGIBILITY FROM 33% TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT- THIS IS KIND OF IN LINE WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES ALREADY. WE'RE ALSO PROPOSING TO CHANGE ELIGIBILITY M. SEPARATE THE COMMUNICATION ASSESSMENT SO BREAKING OUT RECEPTIVE AND EXPRESSIVE LANGUAGE COMMUNICATION. AND THEN HIGHLIGHTING THE THAT THE FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME AND THE RISKS THAT THAT MAY POSTED BELLMAN DELAYS- ADDITIONALLY LAST YEAR THE LET THE LEGISLATURE HEAD OFFICE ABOUT SOME OF THE COLOR FLEXIBILITY SO WHAT WE MIGHT CONTINUE. SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF ADDITIONS HERE- I'M GOING TO MAYOR VISION PROPOSES TO PAY THE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SERVICES OUTSIDE OF INDIVIDUAL BUDGETS AND SELF DETERMINATION. AND THIS WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH OF OTHER SERVICES THAT USE PURCHASE. EVAN MATHIS. OF ON THE COST SHARING PROGRAM THERE ARE TWO FEES. ALL WERE SUSPENDED DURING THE PANDEMIC- WE'RE PROPOSING TO EXTEND THAT SUSPENSION THROUGH DECEMBER TWENTY TWO- BUT THEN IN JANUARY ELEVATE THAT- FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL THRESHOLD TO SIX HUNDRED PERCENT. THIS WOULD BE KIND OF IN LINE WITH SOME OF THE OTHER SUBSIDY PROGRAMS. AND THEN FINALLY- ALTERNATIVE SERVICES WHICH HELP TO MAKE SURE INDIVIDUALS RECEIVE THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS- ADDRESS THEIR- IMMEDIATE NEEDS DURING THE PANDEMIC. BUT ALSO SUPPORT THE PROVIDER NETWORK IN SOME OF THOSE A MORE CHALLENGING INSTANCES. SO THE MAYOR VISION PROPOSES LANGUAGE TO EXTEND THAT THROUGH DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWO. BUT ALSO TO PROVIDE MORE CHOICE FOR INDIVIDUALS- AT THE TAYLOR DAY SERVICE WHICH AGAIN RIGHT INTO VISUALS MORE MORE CHOI CHOICE IN THEIR SERVICES- AND THEN TO HELP WITH PROVIDERS AND SOME OF THOSE ADDRESSING THE CHANGING SCHEDULES OF INDIVIDUALS. ELIMINATE THE HALF DAY BILLING- ADDITIONAL ITEMS INCLUDING THE MAYOR VISION. OF FUNDING TO SUPPORT THE- ON GOING PLANNING WITH THE CITY OF COSTA MESA FOR THE DISPOSITION OF FAIRVIEW- SOME ADDITIONAL EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PLANNING- BUILDING OFF OF THE INVESTMENT LAST YEAR. TO PROVIDE SOME ONGOING RESOURCES- AND THEN A NUMBER OF PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE AMENDMENTS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DIRECTION GUIDANCE- WITH SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS- FOR THE BILL ALSO ADDRESSING ADDITIONAL CHANGES. AND THEN- CAL POLY- INCREASE COSTS FOR CONSTRUCTION INDEX AS WELL AS REAPPROPRIATION. OPPONENTS OF CHRISTOPHER O'NEILL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOTHING FURTHER TO ADD MR. SUN YOU PICK THE PLO IS A THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- SONYA PADDOCK WITH THE L. A. O. OKAY WE JUST READ- OBVIOUSLY IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING ALL OF THE MAY REVISION PROPOSALS WE'RE GOING TO LIMIT OUR COMMENTS TODAY TO THE PROPOSAL FOR WORK FOR STABILITY- WE KNOW THAT. THIS PROPOSAL IS MEANT TO ADDRESS WHAT WE HEAR IS A BIG AND GROWING AND IMMEDIATE PROBLEMS IN THE DDS- SYSTEM BALL FOR REGIONAL CENTERS AS WELL AS SERVICE PROVIDERS- I GUESS OUR COMMENTS WILL. COME DOWN TO TWO MAIN POINTS HOWEVER ONE IS- ARE THESE THE RIGHT SOLUTIONS TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM IN THE NEAR TERM. AND THEN IN LIGHT OF THE STATE'S- CHALLENGES WITH THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT ARE THESE PROPOSALS REALLY READY TO GO- SO FOR EXAMPLE- THIS PROPOSAL DOES NOT HAVE ASSOCIATED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE SO IT'S HARD TO KNOW EXACTLY HOW SOME OF THE INITIATIVESWOULD WORK- ON BOTH THE TRAINING AND INTERNSHIP COMPONENTS OF THE PROPOSAL WERE NOT- CERTAIN THAT THESE PROPOSALS WOULD NECESSARILY SOLVE- THE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION PROBLEM AMONG THE- DIRECT SERVICE PROVIDER- WORK FORCE- POPULATION. AND THEN ON THE PIECE THAT CONCERNS TUITION REIMBURSEMENT FOR REGIONAL CENTER STAFF WE BELIEVE THERE ARE SOME- KEY DETAILS THAT ARE LACKING FROM THE PROPOSAL. SO FIRST- THE PROPOSAL DOES NOT SPECIFY WHAT THE REQUIRED WORK COMMITMENT WOULD BE FOLLOWING RECEIPT OF THE TUITION REIMBURSEMENT- IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THIS HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED YET M. BUT THE LEGISLATURE. OBVIOUS INTEREST IN MAKING SURE THAT IT GETS- SOME BENEFIT FROM AN INVESTMENT IN INDIVIDUALS EDUCATION- SECONDS WE'RE NOT SURE IF THIS WILL BE SORT OF AN IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGE OR NOT BUT DDS INDICATED TO OUR OFFICE THAT BECAUSE- HALF ABOUT HALF OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS ARE UNIONIZED. WHETHER THAT COULD- HAVE TO HAVE SOME KIND OF INTERACTION WITH THIS PARTICULAR PUZZLE TO REIMBURSE SOME PEOPLE'S TUITION- THAT'S JUST AN ISSUE WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO THE BOTTOM OF YET- THIRD IT'S SORT OF CLEAR WHICH REGIONAL STAFF WOULD BE ELIGIBLE WHO WOULD MAKE THIS DETERMINATION AND WHAT CRITERIA THAT WOULD BE BASED ON. AND THEN LASTLY- THERE ARE SOME OTHER JUST SMALL DETAILS THAT COULD HAVE IMPLICATIONS AND NEED TO BE IRONED OUT SO JUST FOR EXAMPLE IN THE PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE- IT SPECIFIES THAT- THIS WOULD HELP PAY FOR REGIONAL CENTER. STAFF TO PURSUE ADVANCED DEGREES BUT IT DOESN'T DEFINE WHAT AN ADVANCE ADVANCED DEGREE IS IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT TYPICALLY REFERS TO SERVE. POSTGRADUATE AND GRADUATE- DEGREES BUT I THINK- DDS WOULD LIKE THAT TO ALSO APPLY TO UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF DETAILS THAT STILL NEED TO BE WORKED OUT. IF YOU FROM THE FUNDS THAT MISTER TERRA CHRISTOPHER O'NEILL WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND JUST IN RESPONSE I THINK WITH A MINISTRATION LIKE TO SAY THAT THE REVISION IS- CONTAINING TO BUILD ON HENCE THE OVERALL WORK FORCE STRATEGY WITHIN THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES SYSTEM AND THE PROPOSAL THAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU MAYOR VISION REALLY FOCUSING ON THOSE ENTRY POINTS AND HOLDING ON TO THOSE WORKERS WHO ARE CURRENTLY IN THE SYSTEM AND- SO WE THE MINISTRATIONS SEES AS AS AS AS PART OF A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH AND YOUR FOLLOWS UP ON VESTMENTS FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT INCLUDING- DSP UNIVERSITY WHICH HAS- TRAINING. AND INTERIOR CERTIFICATION DIFFERENTIALS FOR STAFF AS WELL AS BILINGUAL PAY DIFFERENTIALS FOR STAFF SAID THANK YOU. YOU NEXT COULD WE HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENT SPEAKERS FOR THE CST MAY REVISE. PROPOSALS PLEASE COME FORWARD. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- MY NAME IS JASON WIMBERLY CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENT A PLACE TO BE HERE TODAY TO PRESENT THE DEPARTMENT'S PROPOSALS THE FOR PROPOSALS INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S MAYBE VISION. THE FIRST PROPOSAL. THE CALIFORNIA WHERE IT'S PAYMENT PROGRAM. ESTABLISHED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT- CAP DIRECTED ONE BILLION IN FEDERAL AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT FUNDING TOWARDS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE PASSED TO. ENERGY BILL BALANCES ACCRUED BY CUSTOMERS ECONOMICALLY IMPACTED BY THE COVE IN NINETEEN PANDEMIC. THE MAY REVISION INCLUDES AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT TWO BILLION IN FUNDING TO HELP ADDRESS ENERGY RICHES ACCRUED. ACCUMULATED BY CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS IMPACTED BY THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC. WELL CAP HAS MADE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON REDUCING OR ELIMINATING. A CALIFORNIA ENERGY DEBTS FOR THESE- RIGHT FOOT- HE TOLD THE CUSTOMERS. PUBLIC AND INVESTOR OWNED ENERGY UTILITIES ARE REPORTING OTHER PARISHES HAVE CONTINUE TO GROW FOR THESE CUSTOMERS. THE PROPOSAL POSITION CAP TO RELIEVE THIS BURDEN BY DRESSING AND HERE WE'RE JUST EXPERIENCE BY CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS. AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE STATE'S OUR DISASTER RESPONSE TO ADDRESS THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. THE SECONDPROPOSAL THE LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLD WATER ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM PROVIDES FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO LOW INCOME CALIFORNIA'S TO HELP MANAGE THEIR RESIDENTIAL WATER UTILITY COSTS. LIVE UP- WAS CREATED UNDER THE FEDERAL CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIATIONS ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN CALIFORNIA SHARE ONE TIME FEDERAL GRANT FUNDS IS A HUNDRED SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. THE CURRENT PROGRAM BRAND EXPENSIVE PERIOD IS TWENTY JUNE TWENTY TWENTY TWO THROUGH SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME. FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL FISCAL RECOVERY FUNDS TO SUPPLEMENT THE FEDERAL ALLOCATION FOR THIS PROGRAM IN THE ALLOW THE PROGRAM TO CONTINUE AFTER THE FEDERAL FUNDING- FUNDING EXPIRES IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY THREE- THE PROGRAM THE PROPOSED CONTINUATION OF THE PROGRAM WOULD RUN THROUGH JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY SIX. THE THIRD PROPOSAL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY WEATHERIZATION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. CST REQUESTS A ONE TIME INCREASE IN FEDERAL FUNDADOR THE OF A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE POINT THREE MILLION TO UTILIZE SUPPLEMENTAL FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM GRANT FUNDS. THIS FUNDING WAS APPROPRIATED UNDER THE FEDERAL BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE LAW. CST RECEIVES AN ANNUAL GRANT. ALLOCATION OF- WHAT WHAT IS A SIN SYSTEMS FRONTS FROM DEAL WE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS- THIS PROPOSAL APPROVED BY PRESENTS NO INCREASED COST OF THE STATE. CST HAS BEGUN THE PROCESS OF CONSULTING WITH STAKEHOLDERS SPECIFICALLY OUR LOCAL SERVICE PROVIDERS ON PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING. THE PROBABLY THE SERIES OF PUBLIC ENGAGEMENTS OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DEAL BASIC PLAN THAT'S REQUIRED FOR THIS% FUNDING. THE STATE PLANS REQUIRED TO BE SUBMITTED TO DOT FOR THEIR APPROVAL BY OCTOBER. ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO- THE FNAL PROPOSAL- IS UP. FOR RE APPROPRIATION A QUEST. FOR LOW LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WITH SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEMS AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY UPGRADES AT NO COST. ALSO THIS PROGRAMS CONSIDER WHEN THE CLASS- CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE INVESTMENTS WHICH HELPS REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY SAVING ENERGY AND GENERATING CLEAN RENEWABLE POWER. LIVE UP ALSO REDUCES- ENERGY EXPENSES FOR LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS STRENGTHENING THEIR ECONOMIC SECURITY. OVER THE COURSE OF HIS EXISTENCE THE LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM HAS BEEN FUNDED BY DIFFERENT FUNDING APPROPRIATIONS EACH WITH ITS OWN LIQUIDATION TIME FRAME. THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC IN SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES THAT IMPACT THE CONSTRUCTION TIMELINES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROPERTIES ACCESS AND LIVE WITH FUNDING PREVENTING THE COMPLETION BY JUNE THIRTIETH OF THIS YEAR. CST IS REQUESTING THE APPROPRIATION TO SECURE AN ADDITIONAL YEAR OF LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY TO FOR THESE FUNDS APPROPRIATED VIA THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THIS ADDITIONAL FOR YOUR OF LIQUIDATION AUTHORITY WILL ENABLE THE PROGRAM TO FILL FUNDING COMMITMENTS TO IMPACT THE PROJECTS NOT SURE THE COMPLETION OVER THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR. THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION AND HAPPEN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. YES TWO WILL BAKER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AT THAN THAT AT THIS TIME BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. HELLO THANK YOU ANGELES SHORT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'M JUST A BRIEF COMMENT REGARDING THE PROPOSED ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR AUGMENTATION FOR THE CALIFORNIA RICH PAYMENT PROGRAM OR CAP- WE DO ANTICIPATE RECEIVING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE- WHICH WILL BE. REVIEWING TO- SS ANY SIGNIFICANT PROPOSED IMPLEMENTATION CHANGES BUT BASED ON OUR INITIAL REVIEW WE DO BELIEVE THIS PROPOSAL HAS MERIT- AS YOU HEARD FROM THE DEPARTMENT AND AS WE'VE DISCUSSED IN PREVIOUS HEARINGS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE. THE INITIAL ONE BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE PROGRAM- WAS ALLOCATED UP QUITE QUICKLY IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND HAS PROVIDED MORE THAN ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS WITH ON DEBT RELIEF DURING THE PANDEMIC- SO WE DO SEE THE- PROPOSED AUGMENTATION AS ADDRESSING A CLEARLY ASSESSED- NEED ASSOCIATED WITH THE PANDEMIC- BUT WE WILL CERTAINLY RAISE ANY NEW CONCERNS OR ISSUES AS WE'RE ABLE TO REVIEW THE DETAILS LANGUAGE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT COULD BE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION SPEAKERS FOR THE D. O. MADE REVISED PROPOSALS. JUST DOUBLE CLICK IT SURE MEMBERS. PLEASE BEGIN DIRECTOR XAVIER WHEN YOU'RE READY GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY ON THE TWO PROPOSALS BEFORE US AND IS CERTAINLY DOUBTS AND QUESTIONS YOU HAVE- INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES- OR OLDER ADULTS WERE EITHER INSTITUTIONALIZED OR AT RISK. OF BEING INSTITUTIONALIZED. NEED THE SUPPORT EITHER TO REMAIN INDEPENDENTLY IN THEIR COMMUNITIES ARE TO TRANSITION OUT OF THE INSTITUTIONS. AND THE DISABILITY AND AGING NETWORKS NEED TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP THEIR CAPACITY TO BE ABLE TO MEET- THIS NEED OF TRANSITION. AND DIVERSION ADDITIONALLY OFTEN TIMELY WRAPAROUND SERVICES OF NEEDED TO BOTH KEEP INDIVIDUALS OUT OF INSTITUTIONS. AND TO HELP THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN JUST SITUATIONS TO TRANSITION TO THE COMMUNITY. THE FUNDS THAT WE ARE ASKING FOR THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS OVER ASKING FOR THE PROPOSAL- PROVIDE A GAP FOR INTO FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT AVAILABLE THROUGH OTHER PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THEY CAN PROVIDE IT. JUST IN TIME THOSE CAN INCLUDE THINGS SUCH AS RENT ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY AND PERSONAL ASSISTANCE. AND SERVICE FUND WOULD PRO PROVIDE A BRIDGE TO OTHER SERVICES THAT INDIVIDUALS MAY NEED SO THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY. SO IN ADDITION TO EXPANDING THAT CAPACITY IN GETTING PEOPLE OUT OF THE COMMUNITIES- WE ARE LOOKING CERTAINLY TO- ASSESS THE THIS PILOT THEY WERE PUTTING TOGETHER AND CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD TO SHARING. THE RESULTS OF THAT PART OF IT WITH POLICY THIS IS WELLS OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND LOCAL SYSTEMS. THE ELIGIBILITY FOR THIS PROGRAM OR INDIVIDUALS WHO. ARE NOT ON THAT ACCOUNT IN ORDER 3100% OR LESS OF POVERTY LEVEL. OR INTO WHOSE INCOMES A AND THEN ALSO INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY BE A MEDIC CAL- BUT DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED TO GET OUT OF THE COMMUNITY. SO THE OTHER THING THAT I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THE OTHER ITEMS THAT WE BRING FOR YOU TODAY IS- THE- ALIGNMENT OF OUR JOB COACHING RATES WITH. THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. SO THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES CONTINUE TO ADVANCE COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS OF MOST SIGNIFICANT DISABILITIES INCLUDING INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. AND JOB COACHING IS A SERVICE THAT IS THE CENTRAL BOTH TO GETTING A JOB AND TO KEEPING THAT CHILD. AND GIVEN THE D. O. R. AND THE DEPARTMENT DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES OFTEN USE THE SAME PROVIDERS TO SERVE MUTUAL CONSUMERS CONFORMING THOSE RATES- IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE THERE'S NO DISPARITY- IN THE IN THE SERVICES AND THE RIGHTS PROVIDED. AND SO ACCORDINGLY WE ARE LOOKING FOR ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS THERE TO CONFORM TO THE RATES THAT THE DDS WILL ALSO BE CHANGING- IN THERE. AND THE PROPOSED BUDGET. SO GLAD TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS- THAT YOU HAVE FOR US. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. NOTHING THAT AT THIS TIME BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS HELLO. SENATE HEADED WITH THE L. A. O.

AS A REALLY TO IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES ARE REVIVED CASELOAD AT IS SIX HUNDRED ONE THOUSAND FOUR EIGHT ZERO POINT GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. I WE ARE GLAD AN APPRECIATIVE OF WORKING WITH MANY STAKEHOLDERS RELATED TO OUR PERMANENT BACKUP PROVIDER SYSTEM.

AIM TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH SAFETY IN EDUCATION AT COMMUNITY RESIDENTS IN DEFINED AREAS. THOSE FOUR AREAS INCLUDE CHULA VISTA CORNING HAYWARD IN MISSION PROMISE NEIGHBORHOODS. AND OF COURSE WE HAVE ADDITIONAL AT CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT SUBSIDY INVESTMENTSTHAT ARE BEING HEARD IN SUB TO BUT WITH THAT WE CONCLUDE OUR OVERVIEW. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. IN PERSON% DEPARTMENT FINANCE NOTHING FURTHER TO ADD BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS HELLO CHECK THE PROCEDURE LMAO WE'RE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING ALL OF THE MAY REVISION PROPOSALS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND INCLUDED IN THAT REVIEW IS- LOOKING OVER THE CASELOAD ESTIMATES BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW CASELOAD ESTIMATES AND CAL WORK SITE JUST SAYS THIS I SUSPECT YOU DO HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR I'M PROGRAM COST- ONE THING THAT WE WOULD FLAG ON THE EXERCISES PIECE SIDE THOUGH IS- AS A WAS BROUGHT UP IN JANUARY. THE GOVERNOR HAS SIGNALED AN INTENTION TO- INCREASE S. S. P. GRANTS IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR SO BUDGET YOUR PLUS ONE- BASED OFF OF THE REVISED CASELOAD ESTIMATES IN MAY OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT SINCE CASELOAD CAYMAN- JUST SLIGHTLY HIGHER RELATIVE TO JANUARY ESTIMATES BECAUSE CASE THAT ISN'T GROW ISN'T DECLINING AS QUICKLY AS INITIALLY THOUGHT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS REVISED ITS BEST AS P. GRANT INCREASE ESTIMATE FROM ABOUT TWENTY FOUR PERCENT. TO ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT- AND AGAIN THAT S. S. P. GRADE INCREASE WOULD TAKE EFFECT JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR SO WHILE- THE ACTUAL GRANT INCREASE WON'T BE FINALIZED UNTIL NEXT YEAR IT'S JUST AN. EXAMPLE OF A WHITE. WE'RE GOING TO JUST BE LOOKING AT OF US MORE TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF NOT JUST BUDGET YOUR APPLICATIONS BY YOUR IMPLICATIONS. AND THEN WITHOUT ME TO PASS IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE ANGELA SHORT FOR COMMENTS ON THE CHILD WELFARE PROPOSALS. HUH THANK YOU ANGELES SHORT WITH YELLOW- JUST A FEW COMMENTS IN PARTICULAR REGARDING THE PROPOSALS OF THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR A CARE GIVER APPROVALS ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR- FAMILY FINDING AN ENGAGEMENT GRANTS. AND THE FOUR POINT NINE MILLION- TO CONTINUE PROVIDING EMERGENCY CARE GIVERS WITH FUNDING PRIOR TO APPROVAL BEYOND NINETY DAYS- OVERALL BASED ON OUR PRELIMINARY REVIEW WE DO FIND THAT THESE PROPOSALS ALIGNED WITH THE- OVERARCHING GOALS OF THE CHILD WELFARE CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM. AND CONCEPT WOULD REPORT CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF THE FUNCTIONING OF THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM- NAMELY ENSURING THAT SUFFICIENT NUMBERS OF RESOURCE FAMILIES CAN BE APPROVED IN A TIMELY MANNER. AND HELPING TO REACH THEIR GOAL OF PLACING FOSTER YOUTH- WITH RELATIVES AND FAMILY BASED SETTINGS TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE- IN PARTICULAR WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE AREAS OF CARE GIVER PRIVIL AND PLACEMENT PRIOR TO APPROVAL- ARE AREAS WHERE WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED POTENTIAL UP THE POTENTIAL NEED FOR AUGMENTATIONS WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO ENSURE WE FULLY UNDERSTAND HOW THEY ARRIVED AT THE- THE SPECIFIC BUDGET FIGURE. THE FIFTY MILLION FOR THE CHARACTER FOR APPROVAL- AND WE WILL FOLLOW UP AS WE LEARN MORE AND ALSO AND BE SURE TO ENGAGE WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO- TO UNDERSTAND- THE FULL NEED FOR RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL FUNDING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT IS THE CONCLUSION THE PANELISTS FOR NOW I WILL ASK YOU TO STAY JUST FOR A FEW QUESTIONS IF I CAN. I WILL LOOK TOWARDS OTHER MEMBERS I WILL KEEP IT HERE AT THE CHAIR TO BEGIN. I'M I'M GOING TO KEEP IT WITH THE CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM IF I CAN AND REALLY WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE FAMILY FINDING SUPPORT AND THE ENGAGEMENT. GRANT DID PRIOR APPROPRIATIONS FOR FAVORS INCLUDING A COUNTY MATCH. ISN'T THE ADMINISTRATION CONCERNS THAT A COUNTY MATCH COULD RESULT IN UNEQUAL TREATMENT FOR FOSTER YOUTH ACROSS COUNTIES HOPING YOU COULD COMMENT ON THAT I'LL START WITH THE SECOND MOVIE TURNS MY IT AT CALLING THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- AS IT RELATES TO THE AND EVEN IMPLEMENTATION WHAT WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE FAMILY FINDING A RESPONSIBILITY IS A RESPONSIBILITY THAT EXISTS TODAY. I WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE IS LEVERAGING THOSE FUNDS IN THOSE RESOURCES USING AGAIN WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED WORKS IN OUR EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES AT FURTHER AGAIN LEVERAGE THOSE FUNDS AND CONTINUE THAT EFFORT- WE ARE ABSOLUTELY INTENDING TO- TAKE THE LESSONS LEARNED IN THE AT BEST PRACTICES OUT OF THAT COMPONENT AND APPLY THEM UNIVERSALLY THE MATTER WHETHER OR NOT A COUNTY IS PARTICIPATING. AT SPECIFICALLY IN THIS COMPONENT OF THE PROGRAM SO THERE WILL BE A UNIVERSAL APPLICATION IN THAT IN THAT SENSE IN TERMS OF THOSE PRACTICES BUT RELATED TO PEPPERS I WILL TURN OVER TO JUST INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF FINANCING I THINK ONE THING IS CLEAR WHETHER THE THAT'S A GOOD HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FLIPPERSFUNDING. FAMILY FUN AND SO THE PAPER SPENDING WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONTINUING CARE REFORM THE IDEA WAS THAT AS A RUNS WHERE TRANSITIONING YOUTH FROM A CONGREGATE CARES INTO HOME BASED ON THE CARE SETTINGS AT A QUICK PROCESS- THE MINISTRATION AND KNOWLEDGE THAT THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WOULD NEED TO BE EXPEDITED SO THE RESULT FROM FUNDING PUT INTO A SUPPLEMENT. AS DIRECTOR JOHNSONSAID THE COUNTY RESPONSIBILITIES ALREADY THEY WERE REALIGNED FOR THEM FOR FAMILY FIND IT SO COMPARING THE TWO IS A SLIGHTLY A THINK A LITTLE MISLEADING BECAUSE OF THAT NOW WITH THE COUNTY MATCH- WE THINK THAT THAT THE IDEA THIS IS TO SUPPLEMENT AGAIN THOSE ACTIVITIES AND THIS IS A CORE FUNCTION FOR COUNTIES IN THE IDEAS TO HELP. INCENTIVIZE WOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE MAKING SURE THAT THE YOUTH ARE PUT INTO PLACE AND THAT IS FOR THEIR NEEDS SO WE DON'T SEE THAT THERE WOULD BE AN IN EQUITY THERE- BECAUSE AGAIN THESE ARE RECENT THESE ARE ACTIVITIES THAT-ALREADY COUNT SHOULD BE. DOING ANA REQUIRED TO DO THROUGH. TO ELEVEN RELY RELATE. IT FOR SOME OF US WE LIKE. AND SINCE VISITATION IT'S WHETHER CERTAIN COUNTIES WILL GET LEFT BEHIND BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT MATCHING THOSE FUNDS AND US THAT'S THE INEQUITY THAT WERE CONCERNED WITH IS A FOR LEAVING IT UP TO THE COUNTIES TO PUT THEIR PORTION NOT. I UNDERSTAND WE'RE TRYING TO LEVERAGE I JUST. AM WORRIED ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT DECISION UNTIL IT CAPITAL LEAVE THAT OPEN FOR NOW IF WE CAN. IF I'M IT JUST ONE MORE COMING ON THAT RECOGNIZING THAT THAT IT WAS A THAT WAS PART OF THE POINT OF TWO THOUSAND REALIGNMENT. COUNTIES DO YOU HAVE A LOOK AT A LOCAL CONTROL WHERE THEY CAN IDENTIFY AND PRIORITIZE WHERE THEIR FUNDING WHERE THEY WOULD LIKE TO ON THEIR SERVICES BUT RECOGNIZE THOSE COMMENTS. THANK YOU- I'LL MOVE ON TO CALFRESH ELIGIBILITY FUNDING IF I CAN. IT SEEMS THAT THERE CONTINUES TO BE A SIXTY MILLION DOLLAR DEFICIENCY IN THE MAY REVISION. FOR CALIFORNIA'S ELIGIBILITY. CAN YOU HELP US. TO TELL US ABOUT WHAT THE CLIENT IMPACTS WOULD BE OF THIS UNDER FUNDING. WHAT KINDS OF DELAYS IN PROCESSING ARE WE SEEING. HOPING TO GET AN ANSWER ON THAT IF POSSIBLE. JUSTIN FREITAS ONE OF FINANCE I WITH MY COLLEAGUES- GINNY DOCTOR WHO IS ON A JOURNEY THROUGH AN EXTRA CAN RESPOND TO. SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS. MAN MISTER ACTOR IF YOU'RE AVAILABLE. YEAH HI I. JEANINE DR DEPART. IM SERVICE SO I CAN HELP YOU OUT THERE A LITTLE BIT I AM SO WHILE THE ADMINISTRATION IS ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO EVALUATING THE CALL FRESH ELIGIBILITY FUNDING METHODOLOGY WORKING WITH YOU TO BE TODAY AND COUNTIES ARE NOT EVALUATION- AND WE HAVE REVIEWED THE SIXTY MILLION DOLLAR- BUDGET YOUR REQUEST WOULD DETECT WHICH DID COMPASS YOU WTXF. WE WE NOTE SOME CONCERNS. THAT SIXTY MILLION DOLLAR ESTIMATE USED IN THE PAST YEAR AGGREGATE DATA TO PROJECTED OVER EXPENDITURE OF SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE CURRENT YEAR DESPITE THE REQUEST BEING MADE FOR BUDGET HERE. I'M IN THE CURRENT YEAR COUNTY ELIGIBILITY ALLOCATION IS BEING HEALTH LOT INFAMY REVISION DESPITE A 5% DECREASE IN PROJECTED BRING YOUR CASELOAD COMPARED TO THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET- ENACTMENT PROJECTIONS- REVISION IS ALSO PRETTY A PER D. AND BUDGET YOUR CASELOAD COMPARED TO GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROJECTIONS WOULDN'T THAT SIXTY MILLION DOLLAR ESTIMATE WAS MADE- SO ESSENTIALLY UP. YOUR POINT OF COMPARISON ISN'T EXACTLY. PERFECT THERE ARE AND ONCE WE ARE ABLE TO ENGAGE IN GETTING COUNTY IS INSIDE EVERYDAY AND COLLECT SURVEY DATA WILL BE BETTERPOSITIONED UNDERSTANDS THE UNDERLYING CALFRESH ELIGIBILITY COSTS. MY HOPE IS THAT WE ARE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACTS TO THOSE WHO ARE RECEIVING SERVICES AND SO- IT AT SOME POINT TO- WE SEEING. CALL CENTER WAIT TIMES GOING UP ARE WE SAYING HANG UPS ARE WE SEEING TRENDS AND DISCONTINUANCE SAYS ERROR RATES. THESE OCCUR WHEN WE DON'T HAVE THE APPROPRIATE ELIGIBILITY FUNDING AND I'M HOPING TO SEE IF WE ARE NOTICING ANY TRENDS- BECAUSE OF THE DECISIONS WE MAY MAKE. SO I THINK FOR SOME OF THE STUFF AND QUESTIONS ARE UP TO DEFERRED TO- DIRECTOR JOHNSON BUT- I TO REITERATE I BELIEVE IT'S A I KNOW THE IT WAS A LITTLE DIFFICULT FOR OF THE- AUDIO THERE. BUT THE ADMINISTRATION IS COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION ON REBATES IN LOOKING THE METHODOLOGY FOR THE ADMINISTRA ADMINISTRATION COMPONENT OF THE CALIPHATE'S PROGRAM- JUST A TO ME FALLS A LITTLE BIT ON WHAT MY COLLEAGUE SAID IT'S JUST. THE SIXTY MILLION DOLLAR- PROPOSAL FROM CANADA FOR DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION WE JUST WE COULDN'T TIED TOGETHER HOW THAT WAS ASSOCIATE WHERE WHERE THE WORKLOAD WAS IT WAS BEING MESSED- SO AGAIN WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO WORK ON. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT A SINGLE PAYER ADVOCATES ARE IN AGREEMENT TO WORK ON THAT METHODOLOGY NEXT YEAR WITH THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES SO IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO. BEING ABLE TO ANSWER AND THEN ADDRESS- WITH THE LEGISLATURE NEXT YEAR IN IN IN SURE I'M HAPPY TO SHARE PROGRAMMATIC LEE APPLICATION PROCESSING TIMES HAVE NOT BEEN IMPACTED AS THE TIMELINESS OF THE THIRTY DAY PROCESSING. HAS STAYED RELATIVELY THE SAME OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS THE TIMELINESS OF EXPEDITED SERVICES- HAS DECREASED BY ROUGHLY 8% SO THAT JUST IN TERMS OF RETURN QUESTION WANTED TO PROVIDE THAT. I'M SURE WE MIGHT HEAR FROM C. W. D. EIGHT LATER ON THIS- BUT WOULD ASK EIGHT CAN ONE FINAL QUESTION S. S. BEFORE I MOVED TO DDS. AND IT'S RELATED TO THE CAL WORKS. SINGLE ALLOCATION FUNDING. A WHAT FOR. IS YOUR DEPARTMENT HEARING ABOUT THE CONSTRAINTS ON ELIGIBILITY PROCESSING. AND THE IMPACTS ON EMPLOYMENT SERVICES SPECIFICALLY. GIVEN THE FUNDING DEFICIENCY THAT WE'RE HEARING ABOUT WITHIN SINGLE ALLOCATION. WHICH CONTINUES TO BE AN ISSUE HERE AT THE MAY REVISION HOPING YOU CAN COME AND TO SHARE SIMILARLY I WOULD JUST SAY. GET RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE HAVE CONVERSATION WITH COUNTIES MAY HAVE. ADDITIONAL NEEDS THAT IT'S BEEN NOW THREE YEARS SINCE WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE AGREED UPON METHODOLOGY WHERE WE LOOKED AT THAT. FORMULA THAT WAS AROUND INCREMENTS THAT HE BELIEVES IN CHILE THE INCREMENTS BASED ON CASE LOW TO JUST MINCE WOULD HAPPEN. ONLY SO OFTEN AND- WHAT I WOULD JUST SAY IT HOLISTICALLY AS WE ARE GLAD TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS AROUND HOW FREQUENTLY- WE ACTUALLY TAKE A LOOK AT THAT METHODOLOGY- GOING FORWARD AT. IT AGAIN IT WAS- ALL OF OUR BEST THINKING AT THE TIME WE ARE APPLYING IT WE ARE HEARING FROM THE COUNTIES THAT CONCERNED- SO WE WANT TO. CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS TO ENSURE THAT AGAIN ULTIMATELY ALL THE WORKING INVESTMENT WE PUT INTO SUPPORT AT THOSE FAMILIES AT IS TRUE SO GLAD TO CONTINUE TO TALK FURTHER. INTRODUCTORY THE MONEY RESPONDED IN A BIG. THERE ALSO IS SOME CLARIFICATION AS WE PROVIDED ON HOW THE FUNDING IS SURVIVOR CAL WORKS AS WELL WITH WITH A PROPOSAL SO. CAL WORKS ADMINISTRATION FUNDING IS. BASED OFF A CASELOAD SO FOR EXAMPLE WE HAD AN ESTIMATED CASELOAD AT THE TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT FOR NOW WHICH IS CURRENT YEAR. ENDS IF WE FUNDS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE STATE PROVIDES A LEVEL FUNDING EQUAL TO WHAT WE THINK THAT CASE WILL BE WHEN WE DO OUR REVIVED THE GOVERNOR'S REVISED BUDGET. I WITH THE REVISED FORECASTED CASELOAD. CANCELED WAS A GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR CURRENT YEAR WAS M. REVISED TO BE DOWN. AND THEN IT GOVERNOR'S ADMIT REVISION HURTING A FURTHER. WELL WE WOULD REDUCE WHAT WE THINK THE CASE IT WILL BE BASED ON THE PRODUCTION WE DON'T PULL BACK THAT FUNDING ASSOCIATED. MEN AND THAT'S BEEN THE CASE SINCE- THE INITIAL PANDEMIC SO WE'VE ASSUMED ANYTHING VALLEY I WOULD AGREE ON THIS. WE ORIGINALLY- COLLECTOR I'LL TRANSFER OUT WHAT WAS GOING HAPPEN QUESO. WE FUNDED THE WERE. THAT HOW NOT A- AT THE HIGHER LAW. AND WE'VE NEVER PULL THAT BACK. SECOND AS DIRECTOR JOHNSON MENTIONED THE STATE COLLECTIVELY CAME TOGETHER AND WITH THE AGREEMENT OF THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTOR SO SHE STAKEHOLDERS CAME UP WITH THE METHODOLOGY. THEY WOULD ADDRESS BIG SWINGS IN INCREASE. OF A CASELOAD AND DECREASES SO THIS RAMP DOWN INCREMENTAL CHANGES DIRECTED JOHNSON MENTIONED. AND THEN THIRDLY HOMAGE. THERE'S NOT A CLEAR FOR A DROP OFF IN FUNDING. THE TWENTY ONE BUDGET OUT THE STATE MADE A ONE TIME AUGMENTATION- OR EXCUSE ME AUGMENTED THE BASE FUNDING LEVEL TO THAT METHODOLOGY WE AGREED TO THREE YEARS AGO BY FORTY MILLION ON GUN. WHICH ISN'T IS REFLECTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGETS. AS WELL AS A ONE TIME AUGMENTATION ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT MILLION FOR THIS CURRENT YEAR. SO I THINK WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS INTO IT WHEN WE'RE SHARING THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT THE STATE NOT PROVIDING ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR HOURS ON END. WE ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN AND THE WORKLOAD IS AN APPEARANCE BECAUSE OUR CASELOAD IS DOWN AND THAT'S THAT'S OUR POSITION ON THAT SO. HAPPY TO CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATIONS BUT- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S CLARIFIED WE DON'T THINK THAT THERE IS. A CLEAR FOR DROP OFF OUR KIND OF FUND UNITS WITHIN. THE AGREED UPON METHODOLOGY THE STATE HAS. HAS DEVELOPED- I AM HEARING YOU AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE CONVERSATIONS I THINK THE CONCERN WE HAVE IS AT THEIR TIME OF NEED FOR CUTTING. THOSE PROGRAMS AND THEIR ABILITY TO HAVE THOSE CONNECTIONS THAT'S HARMING THE PROGRAMS THAT. WE NEED TO BE SUPPORTING RIGHT NOW AND SO HOPEFULLY THAT'S NOT THE CASE SINCE FOR YOUR- BUT WITH THAT I WILL THANK THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES IN ASKED ET ASKED TO COME FORWARD PLEASE. I'M I'LL BEGIN IF I CAN WITH THE PROMOTING WORK FOR STABILITY PROPOSAL AND WE DIDN'T SEE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THUS FAR. WITH THAT PROPOSAL AND I'M HOPING TO. HEAR AN EXPLANATION WHY AND- IF YOU PLAN TO INITIATE THAT ROLL OUT IN THE BUDGET HERE DEPARTMENT GLOBAL SERVICES SO- WE DIDN'T INCLUDE FOR THE BILL BUT WE ARE PLANNING TO LEVERAGE EXISTING RESOURCES SO LOOKING AT EXISTING TRAINING- LOOKING AT OTHER PARTNERS TO PROVIDE REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEM PRO SO LET BUILDING ON WHAT EXISTS TODAY- AND I'M SORRY FORGOT THE SECOND A ROLLOUT YES THIS BUDGET YEAR THANK YOU SECOND QUESTION DID THE ADMINISTRATION CONSIDER THE- RATE STUDY ACCELERATION FOR THE MAY REVISION. AND CAN YOU PROVIDE ANY FEEDBACK ON THE PROPOSAL WHICH- STILL IS A PRIORITY FOR MANY OF US MEMBERS IN THE MAYOR VISION BUT I THINK SOME OF THE INITIAL FEEDBACK AND DISCUSSIONS AS WE WERE ALL LOOKING AT WAYS AND METHODS TO ADDRESS THE- THE CURRENT AND EMERGING WORKFORCE ISSUES. I LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE CONVERSATIONS AS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO RECTIFY THE RATE STUDY WE COMPLETED IN TWENTY NINETEEN- WITH THAT. I WILL LOOK TO SEE IF ANY AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE HAVE QUESTIONS- I WILL PRIOR TO MOVING TOWARDS PUBLIC COMMENT FOLLOW UP WITH. THE S. S. AND ASK AS THEY MENTIONED. TO CONVENE STAKEHOLDERS ON THE ITEMS WE SPOKE ABOUT TODAY IF POSSIBLE. AND WITH THAT I WILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL OF OUR SPEAKERS HERE TODAY. WE WILL NOW BEGIN PUBLIC COMMENT. WE MAY HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT AND THEREFORE I WANT TO URGE YOU. TO KEEP YOUR COMMENTS BRIEF SO THAT WE CAN HEAR FROM EVERYONE. WE WILL START WITH ANY IN PERSON PUBLIC COMMENT IN THE HEARING ROOM. PLEASE COME FORWARD TO THE MICROPHONE IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT. RIGHT HERE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS KATHY SANDERLING MADONNA WITH THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION FIRST JUST LET ME THEY WERE REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THE TIME THAT YOU SPENT THIS YEAR WORKING WITH US AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS OF THE PROGRAMS THAT IS ALWAYS THE NEEDS OF COUNTIES TO ADMINISTER THE PROGRAMS AS YOU NOTED DIRECT SERVICES INCLUDE THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE FOR OUR SOCIAL WORKERS ARE ELIGIBILITY STAFF AND SO THINKING ABOUT IMPACTS ON THOSE SERVICES ARE NOT FULLY FUNDED IS REALLY CRITICAL TO APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT TODAY. WE DO HAVE- JUST A COUPLE AREAS OF CONCERN THE FLAG I THINK YOU'VE ACTUALLY ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT BOTH OF THEM SO FAR- FIRST WITH REGARDS TO OUR ABILITY OPERATIONS IF ADOPTED AS PROPOSED MAYOR VISION WHAT IS UNITED CUT BOTH CALFRESH AND CAL WORKS ELIGIBILITY OPERATIONS AT A TIME WHEN THE CASES ARE PROJECTED TO INCREASE AND BOTH PROGRAMS AND HOW IT WORKS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS THAT THE COUNTIES WOULD BE FORCED TO SHIFT FUNDS FROM PLANET SERVICES THIS IS WOULD COME AT A TIME AND WE'RE BEING ASKED TO RE ENGAGE. PEOPLE'S CLOCKS ARE TICKING BECAUSE OF THE CHANGE TO THE- THE NUMBER OF MONTHS THAT THEY'RE AT THAT THEY ARE ELIGIBLE WE- ARE ALSO SEEING OPPORTUNITIES TO GET OUR CLIENTS INTO JOBS THAT THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN COMPETITIVE FOR IN THE PAST THE PEOPLE ARE HIRING THEY'RE PAYING WHILE THEY'RE WILLING TO TRAIN BUT WE NEED TO CONNECT THEM WITH THOSE JOBS AND PROVIDING THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED IF THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO THAT BECAUSE WE NEED TO KEEP THE FRONT DOOR OPEN OR MANDATED TO DO THIS ELIGIBILITY RELATED SERVICES. WITH THE RESPECT TO FINANCE WE ARE SPENDING THE MONEY NOW THOSE COSTS ARE BEING INCURRED BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE WOULD NOT BE SPENDING THE MONEY SO CUTTING IT WOULD BE A CUT TO OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN CALFRESH I'M IN ADDITION TO THE EXPEDITED SERVICES ISSUES THAT DIRECTOR JOHNSON NOTED WE ALSO HAVE BEEN SEEING INCREASED TURN IN A HIGHER ERROR RATE DURING THE PANDEMIC BOTH OF THOSE THINGS WE THINK CAN BE DIRECTLY CONTRIBUTED TO THE FACT THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO BE FURTHER. AND FURTHER OUT. FROM THE YEAR TWO. AND WHAT. AND THE REASON I MENTION IS. THAT IS HOW ARE. CURRENT STAFF ARE FUNDED. BY THE STATE AS IF IT IS STILL COSTING US. LIKE IT DID IN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE WE'VE NOT RECEIVED A COST OF DOING BUSINESS INCREASE. FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS. THAT'S WHY WE'RE DESPERATE FOR THAT REBASED WORKER. WE UNDERSTAND AND SUPPORT PUTTING IT OFF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO A READ A STORY A PENDANT IT'S A MESS. BUT IN THE MEANTIME WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR AS A DOWN PAYMENT. THAT'S SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS THE METHOD. FOR THE WERE. WE DO LOOK ABOUT WE'RE OVER SPEND BY WE'LL- WOULD WHAT WE WERE HAVE SEE. IF WE MORE. COUNTIES ARE ALREADY SPENDING IT NOW WE NEED THAT HELP TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE PROVIDING SERVICES. AND TRY TO HELP STOP THE HEMORRHAGING QUITE FRANKLY SO WE CAN GET TO THAT NEW METHODOLOGY FOR AREA WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE PROPOSED INVESTMENTS AS YOU HEARD FROM THE L. A. O. THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS NOT OUT. WE DO- AS WE UNDERSTAND SORT OF THE DESCRIPTION OF IN PARTICULAR THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. IT SOUNDS LIKE IT WOULD BE- FOR SOMEWHAT NARROW OF A SET OF SERVICES NOT AS BROAD AS THE FLIPPERS SERVICES THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE IN THE PAST. ALL KNOW THAT THE REASON WHY COUNTIES RECEIVE HER PURSE DURING THE CCR IS BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT. ACTUALLY BEEN REQUIRED TO DO THAT RECRUITMENT AT THE TIME OF TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT- IT WAS NOT UNTIL C. C. R. WITH AN ACTOR THAT THAT BECAME A REQUIREMENT. LOS ANGELES COUNTY IN PARTICULAR WAS NOT DOING FOSTER PARENT LICENSING UNTIL AFTER TWENTY ELEVEN IT'S NOT IN OUR BASE WE DON'T HAVE THE FUNDING FOR THAT. SO WHAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING IS THAT THE FUNDING BE PROVIDED STATEWIDE AND WITHOUT A MATCH AND TO BE PROVIDING THE SERVICES THAT WE COULD DO THROUGH PEPPERS. MORE TO COME OBVIOUSLY IS THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND- GOES FORWARD WE LOOK FORWARD IS ALWAYS TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. MISTER JEREMIH CAROL WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY- THANK YOU OF FIRST OF ALL FOR THE ACTION YOU TOOK TODAY WHICH- IN YOUR BUDGET THE LAST ITEM IN YOUR- IN YOUR- ACTIONS TODAY WAS TO ELIMINATE THE- THE PASS ON FAMILY TO COUNTIES FOR OR- ANY POTENTIAL PAN OF PENALTIES IN THE FUTURE. THIS IS AN ACTION IS LONG OVERDUE. AND FINALLY REMOVES THIS BURDEN THAT'S BEEN PLACED ON COUNTY SANTA ULTIMATELY OUR CLIENTS. FOR BEING SANCTIONED FOR BEING NOT MEETING WORK RATES WE'RE TRYING TO MOVE THIS PROGRAM FORWARD. AND THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN A MAJOR BARRIER IT'S TIME FOR US TO THINK ABOUT THE FAMILIES AND THEIR NEEDS AND NOT THE NEEDS AND THE INTERESTS OF THE STATE WHN IT COMES TO THESE PENALTIES. O I JUST REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT ACTION THAT YOU TOOK TODAY- WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO INCREASE POWER STRIP BY ELEVEN PERCENT. THAT'S OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING THAT IS A GOOD THING. BUT IT ALLS FRANKLY FAR SHORT OF THE AGREEMENT THAT WAS MADE FOUR YEARS AGO TO INCREASE OUR TRANSIT. ASSISTANCE ONE WHICH WOULD NOT KNOW CHARGE NO FOR. IN THE STATE BUT HAVE A CHILD LIVING IN DEEP POVERTY. WE STILL NEED TO GET THERE. AND I'M HOPING THAT THIS WILL BE THE YEAR THAT WE DO IT IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET- ON S. ASIDE FROM PART OF THE GRANT TO BE XCELERATED TO JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE SO THE RECIPIENTS DON'T HAVE TO WAIT AN ENTIRE YEAR WE'RE VERY DISMAYED TO HEAR THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS. A REDUCE THE SIZE OF THAT INCREASE IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE A CASELOAD INCREASE FOR YEARS WHEN CASE THOSE WERE DECLINING NONE OF THOSE GENERAL FUND SAVINGS ARE EVER PASSED ALONG TO THE TO THE RECIPIENTS IN THE FORMER BRAND INCREASES BUT NOW THE REVERSE IS HAPPENING THAT THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK THE COMMITTEE SHOULD TAKE A VERY CLOSE LOOK AT- ON CHILD SUPPORT. AGAIN WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL TO THE GOVERNOR FOR A PASSING THROUGH FORMALLY ASSISTED CASES BUT WE STILL ARE ASKING THE COMMITTEE TO PASS THROUGH ALL CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS TO THE CURRENT POWERS CASES WHICH REPRESENT THE POOREST CHILDREN IN OUR STATE AND SO WE'RE HOPING AGAIN THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD BE ABLE TO GET THAT INTO THIS YEAR'S BUDGET AND I KNOW YOU'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME TO PROBABLY PATIENTS WITH ME- OF- THE DEFENDANT. OKAY THAT'S IT I I'M DONE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR ROMULAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S BECKY DEBBIE I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FOR ADULT DAY SERVICES REPRESENTING TWO HUNDRED SEA BASS IN EIGHTY P. CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA THE BUDGET ASK THAT WE HAVE WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE MAY BUDGET REVISION WE CONTINUE TO URGE YOU TO SUPPORT OUR SIXTY ONE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLAR BRIDGE TO RECOVERY ASKED THE PROPOSAL MIRRORS A CHILD CARE FACILITY IMPROVEMENT GRANT PROGRAM THAT'S ALREADY BEEN FUNDED BY THE STATE. AND IT ALSO DIRECTLY PARALLELS SEVERAL GOALS IN THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING THAT ARE CRITICAL TO PROVIDE EQUITY AND ACCESS TO CARE FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE FRAIL AND DISABLED. FINDING IS ALSO IMPERATIVE FOR CENTERS TO PROVIDE A TRACE SAFE TRANSITION FOR BACK TO IN CENTER SERVICES IN ADDRESSES COVERT RESPONSE BY HELPING CENTERS MAKE NECESSARY FACILITY IMPROVEMENTS. EASES WORKFORCE ISSUES AND VERY HARD TRANSPORTATION ISSUES AGAIN IT KEEPS THIS VULNERABLE POPULATION SAFE AND OUT OF NURSING HOMES OVER FORTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS RELY ON OUR SERVICES. THERE IS ALSO A LITTLE BIT OF AN URGENCY RIGHT NOW POTENTIALLY JULY FIRST THERE IS AN END TO THE TEMPORARY ALTERNATIVE SERVICES THAT HAVE BEEN AUTHORIZED AND SENTENCE MUST RE OPEN FULLY AT THE END OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. I THIS FUNDING IS NOT APPROVED CENTERS MAY NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO STAY OPEN IT'S CRITICAL BECAUSE WITHOUT THIS FUNDING CENTERS WILL CLOSE AND CLIENTS WILL LOSE THE NECESSARY SERVICES AND SUPPORT THEY NEED. MAY RETURN TO NURSING HOMES OR MAY NOT BE ABLE TO STAY IN SERVICE ALSO I JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT MOST OF THE FUNDING REQUEST. THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE AND THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS BEING FINALIZED IS AGAIN EXEMPT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. THE DUCHESS YES. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DANIEL CONFESSING ON THE PUBLIC POLICY MANAGER FOR THE CALIFORNIA FOUNDATION FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS AND I WANT TO- APPLY TO ONE OF THE- BUDGET- ITEMS HERE IT IS SPECIFICALLY ITEM KNOWN ISSUE TWENTY NINE- THIS IS THE- COMMUNITY LIVING FUND TEN MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME INVESTMENT TO ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION. TO EXPAND SERVICES AND PROGRAMS THAT ASSIST OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND TRANSITIONING FROM NURSING HOMES TO- AND INTENT LIVING COMMUNITY SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL I ALSO HAVE SOME COMMENTS FROM SOME OF OUR- A SIMILAR CONSUMERS HERE THAT REALLY COULD BENEFIT FROM THIS- WHAT THIS- FUNDING MEANS FOR THE COMMUNITY LIVING- INVESTMENT. MEANS MORE TRANSITION SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS AND WITH DISABILITIES THAT WANT TO LIVE IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND JUST NEED A LITTLE EXTRA SUPPORT TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. THAT ALSO MEANS CONNECTING PEOPLE WHO WANT TO LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY WITH DISABLED- ROLE MODELS WHO CAN PROVIDE THE CENTRAL PEER SUPPORT. AT TO BE SUCCESSFUL AMIN'S INSURING THAT THOS ARE OFTEN UNABLE TO RETURN TO THEIR HOMES AFTER A STROKE OR OTHER EXPECTED MEDICAL EMERGENCY- HAVE THE FUND UNIVERSES OF TECHNOLOGY OR OTHER DISABILITIES EQUIPMENT NEEDED TO LIVE AND THRIVE SAFELY IN THEIR OWN HOMES SO I THINK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND- URGE STRONG CONSIDERATION FOR THE SUB. PROPOSAL THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM MR CHEN MEMBERS CHRIS RESPONSES. POLICY ADVOCATE THE WESTERN AND I'M ON POVERTY- OUR FIRST RECORD THE LEGISLATURE TO ADOPT THE FOOD FOOD FOR A PROPOSAL THAT WOULD EXTEND. C. FIVE BENEFITS TO ALL CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS OR THE RANGE. ADDITIONALLY WE WOULD OUR ORGANIZATION STANDS FIRMLY AGAINST POLICIES. THAT LEADS FAMILIES TO DO FAMILY SEPARATION WHEN FAMILIES ARE REFERRED TO THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. TODAY WE'RE ASKING THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE MONEY FOR EXPERIENCE NONPROFIT LEGAL SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS THAT CAN PROVIDE PRE PETITION LEGAL SERVICES TO THESE FAMILIES. PROCESS IN THE LEGISLATURE TO STOP REFRAIN. FROM THE REFERRING OF COWARDS FAMILIES THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM DUE TO FINANCIAL EXACT INSTEAD THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE THE FAMILIES. OF THE FAMILIES TELEVISION STABILIZATION PROGRAM. OF THE LEGISLATURE IS UNABLE ALLOCATE FUNDING FOR THESE TWO ITEMS THIS YEAR. GOOD ACTORS ARE THEY'LL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE REPORT NEXT FOR NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET. OUGHT. TO CONSIDER THESE TWO ITEMS THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS AMY WESTLING AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE ASSOCIATION OF REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES ARE GONNA SUBMITTED A COMPREHENSIVE BUDGET RESPONSE LETTER- I BELIEVE OVER THE WEEKEND ADD TO MEMBERS AND STAFF AND JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT AND FOREMOST WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL RELATED TO WORK FORCE WE DON'T VIEW THIS AS AN EITHER OR PROPOSAL- INVESTING IN WORKFORCE NEEDS TO HAPPEN ALL OVER THE PLACE AND IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN OUR SYSTEM IN A VARIETY OF WAYS. SO THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL BRINGS PEOPLE INTO THE FRONT DOOR HEARD ENHANCES RETENTION AND- IT ALSO DOES THE SAME ON THE REGIONAL CENTER STAFF SIDE BUT WE KNOW THAT A LONGER TERM SOLUTION IS ADDRESSING THE STAFF SALARIES THAT ARE BE BETTER ABLE TO BE PAID LONG TERM AND THAT INVOLVES FUNDAMENTALLY UPDATING THE REGIONAL CENTER CORE STAFFING FORMULA AS WELL AS IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RATE MODELS. SECOND WE APPLAUD THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL RELATED TO EARLY START IN THE EXPANSION OF THAT PROGRAM IT'S CRITICAL TO GET AS MANY CHILDREN WHO ARE AT RISK OF DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY IN DISABILITY INTO THE PROGRAM AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.
