00:22:57.309 --> 00:22:59.177
WINE EXPORTS TO CHINA FELL

00:22:59.244 --> 00:23:01.012
NEARLY 25% AFTER TAXES AND

00:23:01.079 --> 00:23:03.582
TARIFFS ON US WINE ENTERING

00:23:03.648 --> 00:23:06.785
CHINA REACHED NEARLY. 80%.

00:23:06.852 --> 00:23:09.187
DEMAND HAS QUICKLY BEEN ABSORBED

00:23:09.254 --> 00:23:12.924
INCREASED EXPORTS FROM CHILE AND

00:23:12.991 --> 00:23:13.525
AUSTRALIA THAT IT'S IN THEIR

00:23:13.592 --> 00:23:17.028
WINE EXPORTS TO CHINA SEARCH.

00:23:17.095 --> 00:23:19.030
LET ME SAY FOR THE RECORD THEIR

00:23:19.097 --> 00:23:21.366
WINE IS NOT AS GOOD AS

00:23:21.433 --> 00:23:23.101
CALIFORNIA.

00:23:23.168 --> 00:23:25.203
ONE FINALLY THESE TERRORISTS ARE

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:27.305
IMPACTING OUR ABILITY TO MEET

00:23:27.372 --> 00:23:29.141
OTHER CHALLENGES WE FACE IN THIS

00:23:29.207 --> 00:23:29.374
STATE.

00:23:29.441 --> 00:23:31.643
CALIFORNIA IS IN THE MIDST OF A

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:33.578
MAJOR HOUSING CRISIS AND THE

00:23:33.645 --> 00:23:35.247
TERRORISTS HAVE HIT THE

00:23:35.313 --> 00:23:38.784
HOMEBUILDING INDUSTRY HEART.

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:39.384
ACCORDING TO SOME ESTIMATES.

00:23:39.451 --> 00:23:42.921
ALREADY ADDED ONE BILLION

00:23:42.988 --> 00:23:45.223
DOLLARS TO THE COST OF US

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:46.892
HOUSING CONSTRUCTION.

00:23:46.958 --> 00:23:49.327
SO IN CONCLUSION.

00:23:49.394 --> 00:23:51.062
IT IS VERY POSSIBLE THAT WE WILL.

00:23:51.129 --> 00:23:53.198
SEE AN END TO THESE TRADE

00:23:53.265 --> 00:23:55.167
DISPUTES ANYTIME SOON.

00:23:55.233 --> 00:23:56.935
AND OUR STATE MUST PREPARE FOR

00:23:57.002 --> 00:23:59.037
PROLONGED IMPACTS.

00:23:59.104 --> 00:24:01.573
NOW THAT THE PROCEDURE HAS GONE

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:04.976
TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST CHINA ON

00:24:05.043 --> 00:24:06.912
THREE OH ONE VIOLATIONS.

00:24:06.978 --> 00:24:09.447
THERE WAS BIPARTISAN CONSENSUS

00:24:09.514 --> 00:24:11.283
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SHOULD

00:24:11.349 --> 00:24:13.018
NOT LEAVE THE NEGOTIATING TABLE

00:24:13.084 --> 00:24:14.886
AND TELL THERE IS MEANINGFUL

00:24:14.953 --> 00:24:17.455
RESOLUTION OF THE ORIGINAL

00:24:17.522 --> 00:24:19.257
VIOLATIONS BY CHINA.

00:24:19.324 --> 00:24:21.126
BUT EVEN LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY

00:24:21.193 --> 00:24:23.395
INVOLVED AND CHINA'S RECENT

00:24:23.461 --> 00:24:24.863
SIGNALS THAT THEY ARE NOT

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:25.430
WILLING TO BET ON SOME KEY

00:24:25.497 --> 00:24:29.201
PROVISIONS.

00:24:29.267 --> 00:24:29.801
THIS COULD TAKE A LONG TIME.

00:24:29.868 --> 00:24:31.770
AND THE TIME IT TAKES FOR THESE

00:24:31.837 --> 00:24:34.873
ISSUES TO RESOLVE MEANS MORE

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:36.875
MONEY COMING OUT OF CALIFORNIA

00:24:36.942 --> 00:24:37.142
POCKETS.

00:24:37.209 --> 00:24:39.277
A STUDY EARLIER THIS YEAR AS I

00:24:39.344 --> 00:24:41.246
MENTIONED BEFORE FOUND THAT THE

00:24:41.313 --> 00:24:43.448
IMPACT OF THE TERRORIST BUT

00:24:43.515 --> 00:24:45.250
REQUIRE A FAMILY OF FOUR TO FIND

00:24:45.317 --> 00:24:47.118

00:24:51.523 --> 00:24:53.191
THAT'S MONEY THE CALIFORNIA

00:24:53.258 --> 00:24:55.260
FAMILIES CAN BETTER SPENT

00:24:55.327 --> 00:24:55.560
ELSEWHERE.

00:24:55.627 --> 00:24:57.162
AND OF COURSE THE IMPACTS TO

00:24:57.229 --> 00:24:59.598
CALIFORNIA COMPANIES ATTEMPTING

00:24:59.664 --> 00:25:03.068
TO STAY AFLOAT AND CONTINUE TO

00:25:03.134 --> 00:25:03.468

TO INVEST IN THIS GREAT STATE --

00:46:38.862 --> 00:46:40.831
WE HAVE ACTUALLY DIVERSIFIED A

00:46:40.898 --> 00:46:43.033
LITTLE BIT KNOWING THAT -- REAL

00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:45.335

AND RAISED ON THE PRICES THAT'S

00:46:47.871 --> 00:46:50.874
ACTUALLY NOT TRUE IF YOU LOOK AT

00:46:50.941 --> 00:46:53.143
ACTUALLY THE WHO ARE PURCHASING

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:55.078
PROPERTY.

00:46:55.145 --> 00:46:56.980

I'LL MAKE A NOTE OF THAT AND LET

00:47:09.393 --> 00:47:10.861
PEOPLE KNOW.

00:47:10.928 --> 00:47:11.461
AND THEN RECENTLY THIS YEAR

00:47:11.528 --> 00:47:15.165
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT MONEY IS

00:47:15.232 --> 00:47:17.034
CALLED TO LEAVE CHINA -- WE

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:18.869
ACTUALLY BROUGHT A DELEGATION OF

00:47:18.936 --> 00:47:21.038

YEAR -- BECAUSE WE WANT IT CHINA

00:47:29.379 --> 00:47:31.281
TO SEE WHAT START UPS ARE LIGHT

00:47:31.348 --> 00:47:32.983
IN THE FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO

00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:34.885
BAY AREA -- AND WE WON AT THE

00:47:34.952 --> 00:47:35.519
LOCAL STARBUCKS TO SEE WHETHER

00:47:35.586 --> 00:47:37.387
OR NOT THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES

00:47:37.454 --> 00:47:38.989
FROM THEM IN CHINA.

00:47:39.056 --> 00:47:40.824
WHETHER IT BE OPENING A MARKET

00:47:40.891 --> 00:47:43.227
WHETHER IT BE MANUFACTURING SOME

00:47:43.293 --> 00:47:43.860
OF THE ITEMS THAT ARE PART OF

00:47:43.927 --> 00:47:46.930
THEIR PRODUCT LINE -- OR WHETHER

WHAT ARE WE FOCUSED ON -- AND

00:47:55.672 --> 00:47:57.374
WHY IS IT NECESSARY FOR WHAT WE

00:47:57.441 --> 00:47:57.941
FOCUSED ON I SHOULD SAY --

00:47:58.008 --> 00:47:59.243
MOVING FORWARD AND WHY IS IT

00:47:59.309 --> 00:48:01.111
NECESSARY TO AYE EVEN HALF

00:48:01.178 --> 00:48:03.113
CHINESE INVESTMENT BECAUSE CHINA

00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:04.815
HAS BEEN A PARTNER AND ALREADY

00:48:04.881 --> 00:48:07.184

00:48:07.851 --> 00:48:09.119
THERE'S A HUGE IMPACT.

00:48:09.186 --> 00:48:11.455
CHINESE DOLLARS HAVE BEEN HAVE

00:48:11.521 --> 00:48:13.457
BEEN IMPORTANT IN KICK STARTING.

00:48:13.523 --> 00:48:16.994
OUR ECONOMY MANY WAYS AND SOME

00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:17.561
PEOPLE DO NOT UNDERSTAND.

00:48:17.628 --> 00:48:19.263
FUNKY CAME ON BOARD AND THEY

00:48:19.329 --> 00:48:21.331

FIVE HOTELS GAVE PEOPLE JOBS.

00:48:33.043 --> 00:48:35.379
AND THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO HELP

00:48:35.445 --> 00:48:37.281
THE ECONOMY -- AND OTHER

00:48:37.347 --> 00:48:37.581
COMPANIES.

00:48:37.648 --> 00:48:39.349
SUCH AS OCEAN WIDE AND THEY WERE

00:48:39.416 --> 00:48:41.551
ABLE TO START AND BUILD AND

00:48:41.618 --> 00:48:43.220
BREAK GROUND ON TWO MILLION

00:48:43.287 --> 00:48:47.024
SQUARE FEET.

00:48:47.090 --> 00:48:48.859
IN OUR TRANSMIT TERMINAL.

00:48:48.925 --> 00:48:49.393
BEFORE THAT TIME THERE WAS

00:48:49.459 --> 00:48:49.926
REALLY NO MOVEMENT IN THE

00:48:49.993 --> 00:48:52.963
TRANSKEI AREA.

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:55.032
AND GREY EAGLE DOING BUSINESS AS

00:48:55.098 --> 00:48:57.234
SPECIFIC EAGLE IN SAN FRANCISCO

THEY'VE BEEN HERE FOR TWENTY

00:48:57.934 --> 00:48:59.569
YEARS AND ALL THEY DID WAS HOLD

00:48:59.636 --> 00:49:01.471

00:49:05.208 --> 00:49:07.144
AND THEY DID BY LAND GREENFIELD

00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:09.079
AND THEY ARE DEVELOPING.

00:49:09.146 --> 00:49:11.214
AND THEY ACTUALLY STE ARE ALMOST

00:49:11.281 --> 00:49:13.150
AND AND THEY ARE DEVELOPING

00:49:13.216 --> 00:49:15.252
ACTUALLY THREE PROJECT ONE IS

00:49:15.319 --> 00:49:17.154
ALREADY COMPLETED IN SAN

00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:18.889

00:49:18.955 --> 00:49:21.258
AND EVEN THOUGH THE VIDEO

00:49:21.325 --> 00:49:23.193
SACRAMENTO I WANTED TO ADD

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:25.195

SACRAMENTO DOWNTOWN AND THAT IS

00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:39.343
VERY IMPORTANT I THINK FOR

NEGATIVE MANNER AND WE'RE REALLY

00:59:35.338 --> 00:59:36.873

TALKING A BIT MORE ABOUT IMPORT

00:59:51.487 --> 00:59:54.991
EXPORT AS LOW TECH GOVERNOR AND

00:59:55.058 --> 00:59:55.625
ASSEMBLY MEMBER TALKED ABOUT AS

00:59:55.692 --> 00:59:55.825
WELL.

00:59:55.892 --> 00:59:56.426
THE MESSAGES BECAUSE SINCE THE

00:59:56.492 --> 00:59:58.861
STRIKE LAST YEAR -- WE ARE AGAIN

00:59:58.928 --> 00:59:59.529
THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF STRICKEN

00:59:59.595 --> 01:00:00.964
UNITED STATES WENT OVER FOUR

01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:01.564
HUNDRED THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS

01:00:01.631 --> 01:00:02.198
IN TWO WAY TRADE WITH THE REST

01:00:02.265 --> 01:00:02.765
OF THE WORLD OUR NUMBER ONE

01:00:02.832 --> 01:00:03.766
TRADING PARTNER CHINA.

01:00:03.833 --> 01:00:04.400
WITH OVER A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY

01:00:04.467 --> 01:00:05.001
BILLION DOLLARS INTO A TRADE

01:00:05.068 --> 01:00:05.601
WITH JUST WITH CHINA ALONE AND

01:00:05.668 --> 01:00:07.303
THIS IS WHAT ARE THE VARIOUS

01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:08.972
PORTS OF ENTRY AROUND THE THE

01:00:09.038 --> 01:00:10.940
STATE OF CALIFORNIA REGION.

01:00:11.007 --> 01:00:13.376
WHAT'S TWO NOTES WHAT'S REALLY

01:00:13.443 --> 01:00:15.144
IMPORTANT TO KNOW IS THAT IF YOU

01:00:15.211 --> 01:00:15.678
ADD UP THE SECOND LARGEST

01:00:15.745 --> 01:00:17.447
TRADING PARTNER JAPAN -- NUMBER

01:00:17.513 --> 01:00:19.115
THREE WHICH IS KOREA.

01:00:19.182 --> 01:00:19.716
NUMBER FOUR NUMBER FIVE NUMBER

01:00:19.782 --> 01:00:21.417
SIX NUMBER SEVENTY ADDED FROM

01:00:21.484 --> 01:00:23.052
NUMBER TWO TO NUMBER TWELVE THEN

01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:23.686
THAT NUMBER EQUALLED IT'S WHAT

01:00:23.753 --> 01:00:25.054
WE TRADE WITH CHINA THAT'S THE

01:00:25.121 --> 01:00:26.990
IMPACT OF TRADE THAT WE HAVE

01:00:27.056 --> 01:00:27.290
WITH CHINA.

01:00:27.357 --> 01:00:27.924
SO THE SPEECH THERAPIST REALLY

01:00:27.991 --> 01:00:28.524
CONCERNING TO US BECAUSE WE'RE

01:00:28.591 --> 01:00:31.461
SEEING A DROP AS THE THE WITH

01:00:31.527 --> 01:00:32.061

01:00:35.231 --> 01:00:37.100
ALREADY REPORTED AND THE FOR SIX

01:00:37.166 --> 01:00:39.302

LOS ANGELES THIS IS IMPACTING

01:00:42.138 --> 01:00:43.239
NOT TO SUPPORT OPERATION BUT

WAREHOUSE A DISTRIBUTION CENTER

01:00:45.174 --> 01:00:45.641
RAIL ASPECT AND ALSO OR

01:00:45.708 --> 01:00:47.377
WHOLESALERS SO A NUMBER OF

01:00:47.443 --> 01:00:47.677
DIFFERENT.

01:00:47.744 --> 01:00:49.579
COMPANIES ARE GOING TO BE IN AND

01:00:49.645 --> 01:00:51.347
PACKED AT NEW PLAY BY IT BY THIS

01:00:51.414 --> 01:00:51.581
CHANGE.

01:00:51.647 --> 01:00:53.516
AND I ALSO WANT TO MENTION THAT

01:00:53.583 --> 01:00:55.284
SITES WHEN WE THINK OF IMPORT

01:00:55.351 --> 01:00:57.320

AND WITH THAT WE ALSO HAVE ALL

01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:17.573
THESE DIRECT FLIGHTS ARE

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:19.475

AND WITH THAT THEY ALSO CREE

01:02:21.204 --> 01:02:21.704
ABOUT TWO POINT SIX BILLION

01:02:21.771 --> 01:02:22.872
DOLLARS OF TAX REVENUE FOR THE

TRADE COMMUNITY AND HOW THAT

01:02:26.242 --> 01:02:27.276
BRINGS EVERYBODY TOGETHER.

01:02:27.343 --> 01:02:29.479
AND WE ARE NOW WITNESSING SOME

01:02:29.545 --> 01:02:31.547
MAJOR -- ISSUES THAT ARE BEING

01:02:31.614 --> 01:02:32.915
FACED BY OUR LOCAL SMALL AND

01:02:32.982 --> 01:02:35.151
MEDIUM SIZE COMPANIES.

01:02:35.218 --> 01:02:35.785
WITHIN GOVERNMENT XIN SOMEBODY

01:02:35.852 --> 01:02:37.086
SINCE ALL COMPANIES DON'T HAVE

01:02:37.153 --> 01:02:40.890
THE RESOURCES FOR SEEING THAT

01:02:40.957 --> 01:02:43.126
ALLOWED THE MARKET.

01:02:43.192 --> 01:02:43.759
THE COMPONENT PARTS FROM CHINA

01:02:43.826 --> 01:02:44.927
THEY WERE LOOKING ANOTHER

01:02:44.994 --> 01:02:45.528
LOCATION FOR MANUFACTURING US

01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:47.463
ALTERNATIVE SOME OF THEM ARE

01:02:47.530 --> 01:02:48.097
LOOKING TO MEXICO TO NEAR SHORE

01:02:48.164 --> 01:02:49.265
UNFORTUNATELY A COUPLE WEEKS AGO

01:02:49.332 --> 01:02:51.134
WHEN THE PRESIDENT DECIDED TO

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:51.801
ANNOUNCE THAT HE MIGHT BE ADDING

01:02:51.868 --> 01:02:53.102
A 5%.

01:02:53.169 --> 01:02:55.404
TAX A TARIFF ON MEXICO PRODUCT

01:02:55.471 --> 01:02:56.873
COMING IN IT BASICALLY ALSO

01:02:56.939 --> 01:02:59.208
CREDIT RISK FOR OUR COMPANIES TO

01:02:59.275 --> 01:03:01.444
MOVE FROM CHINA TO MEXICO NOW

01:03:01.511 --> 01:03:03.246
THEIR STOCK SO THERE'S A LOT OF

01:03:03.312 --> 01:03:05.148
UNCERTAINTY THAT'S REALLY

01:03:05.214 --> 01:03:07.083
CREATING SOME -- BACKLASH

01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:07.717
BECAUSE THESE COMPANIES ARE NOW

01:03:07.783 --> 01:03:09.252
HOLDING STILL AND THEY'RE NOT

01:03:09.318 --> 01:03:09.785
MOVING FORWARD WITH THEIR

01:03:09.852 --> 01:03:11.420
MANUFACTURING OR THEIR ORDERS

01:03:11.487 --> 01:03:13.322
WHICH IS GONNA LATER ON DOWN THE

01:03:13.389 --> 01:03:15.057
LINE IMPACT OUR TRADE LOGISTICS

UP WITH ISSUES OF ONE PIECE.

01:05:39.068 --> 01:05:40.936
WHAT'S THE STUFF.

01:05:41.003 --> 01:05:41.570
THE FIRST CALL WAS FOR SOMEONE

WITH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.

01:05:59.622 --> 01:06:01.190
ALTHOUGH THE USE OF TARIFFS

01:06:01.257 --> 01:06:02.958
ISN'T A NOVEL.

01:06:03.025 --> 01:06:05.161

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:19.575
MAYBE SOME HISTORICAL

01:06:19.642 --> 01:06:20.176

WORTH THEIR WEIGHT IN GOLD.

01:07:19.301 --> 01:07:21.070
AND WHEN I LEFT BEIJING LAST

01:07:21.137 --> 01:07:22.972

I'VE BEEN.

01:07:38.921 --> 01:07:39.488
RETURNING TO OUR WTO STORY THE

01:07:57.306 --> 01:07:59.175
THAT BY DROPPING STATE RESOURCES

01:07:59.241 --> 01:07:59.842
AND LIMITING THE ACTS OF FOREIGN

DOMESTIC MARKET THE CHINESE

01:08:02.912 --> 01:08:03.446
LEADERSHIP IS UNFAIRLY TAKING

01:08:03.512 --> 01:08:05.281
ADVANTAGE OF AN OPEN GLOBAL

01:08:05.347 --> 01:08:05.915
ECONOMY WHILE READING THIS TIME

01:08:05.981 --> 01:08:06.182
AT HOME.

01:08:06.248 --> 01:08:07.183
AND IN SPECIFIC SECTORS EVEN

01:08:07.249 --> 01:08:09.118
WHEN THE U. S. HAS PREVAILED IN

01:08:09.185 --> 01:08:13.422

REMAINED CLOSE TO PART COMPANY

01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:16.892
FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE IN TWO

01:08:16.959 --> 01:08:17.526
CASES THAT THE U. S. ONE YEARS

01:08:17.593 --> 01:08:19.428

01:08:23.532 --> 01:08:25.568
ACTUALLY GETTING LICENSES TO

01:08:27.403 --> 01:08:31.006
W. RULING HAS PROVEN DEVILISHLY

01:08:31.073 --> 01:08:31.307
DIFFICULT.

01:08:31.373 --> 01:08:31.774
I ALSO HAD DIFFERENT

01:08:31.841 --> 01:08:33.476
EXPLANATIONS FOR THE LACK OF

01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:34.944

PRESIDENT XI JINPING.

01:08:41.150 --> 01:08:41.784
BUT THE RESULT HAS BEEN THAT THE

01:08:41.851 --> 01:08:42.852
VAST MAJORITY OF US COMPANIES

01:08:42.918 --> 01:08:45.087

01:30:41.235 --> 01:30:41.836
BROADER TRUMPS THE UNITED STATES

01:30:41.903 --> 01:30:43.104
IN US SOCIETY.

01:30:43.171 --> 01:30:43.704
I THINK ON THE ECONOMIC SIDE.

01:30:43.771 --> 01:30:47.208
IN THIS CURTAILING OF INVESTMENT

01:30:47.275 --> 01:30:47.842
ACROSS BOTH -- BUT ACROSS THE

01:30:47.909 --> 01:30:49.210
PACIFIC IS IS GOING TO BE WHAT

01:30:49.277 --> 01:30:51.479
FARMS -- IN SOME WAYS MAYBE EVEN

01:30:51.546 --> 01:30:52.914
MORE THAN TERRACE AND I THINK

01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:53.447
THEY'RE OTHER ODDS OF HIS

01:30:53.514 --> 01:30:54.782
CONCERNS AND I THINK THE US

01:30:54.849 --> 01:30:55.416
NEEDS TO BE ALERT TO THEM AS I

01:30:55.483 --> 01:30:56.784
SAID.

01:30:56.851 --> 01:30:57.451
BUT I THINK THE ONCE INVESTMENT

01:30:57.518 --> 01:30:59.353
PATTERNS REALLY CHANGE OVER YEAR

01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:01.155
SOME PEOPLE THINK WELL I DON'T

01:31:01.222 --> 01:31:01.823
KNOW ONE INVEST IN CALIFORNIA --

01:31:01.889 --> 01:31:02.390
EITHER ONE OF US THE UNITED

01:31:02.456 --> 01:31:03.391
STATES I'M GONNA GO TO NEW

01:31:03.457 --> 01:31:03.991
ZEALAND OR AUSTRALIA THEN I

01:31:04.058 --> 01:31:05.159
THINK ONCE THAT MIND SETS WHICH

01:31:05.226 --> 01:31:05.726
IS THAT THAT'S THAT'S QUITE

01:31:05.793 --> 01:31:07.395
DANGEROUS.

01:31:07.461 --> 01:31:08.963
YEAH THE END AND AS YOU HAD

01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:11.499
MENTIONED BEFORE.

01:31:11.566 --> 01:31:19.340
THE WHOLE THING ABOUT.

01:31:19.407 --> 01:31:19.607
WHEN IS?

01:31:19.674 --> 01:31:21.342
AND IN CHINA THAT IS STRONG NOT

01:31:21.409 --> 01:31:21.909
ONLY IS CALIFORNIA'S BRIGHT

01:31:21.976 --> 01:31:23.110
TRONG.

01:31:23.177 --> 01:31:25.112
THE BRAND OF OUR CITIES

01:31:25.179 --> 01:31:27.048
FRANCISCO CHANGED.

01:31:27.114 --> 01:31:29.150
THOSE ARE ALL SEEN AS

01:31:29.217 --> 01:31:29.650
DESTINATION PLACES FOR

01:31:29.717 --> 01:31:31.118
INVESTMENT.

01:31:31.185 --> 01:31:31.752
IN A YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT ONLY CAN

01:31:31.819 --> 01:31:33.521
THINK AGAIN THE COUNTRIES WERE

01:31:33.588 --> 01:31:35.323
COMPETING AGAINST OTHER STATES

01:31:35.389 --> 01:31:37.358
TO SOMETHING THAT IS.

01:31:37.425 --> 01:31:43.030
ALSO A CHALLENGE THAT WE ALL

01:31:43.097 --> 01:31:47.368

GOOD SIR OUR BUSINESS IS. TO

01:32:55.036 --> 01:32:56.871
PERFORM IN CALIFORNIA -- ONE

01:32:56.938 --> 01:32:59.240
THING ABOUT THE BAY AREA MOSTLY

01:32:59.307 --> 01:33:01.242
IS THAT DIFFERENT FROM LOS

01:33:01.309 --> 01:33:03.311
ANGELES AT WIMBERLEY SERVICE

01:33:03.377 --> 01:33:05.079
BASED.

01:33:05.146 --> 01:33:07.348
SO I'M WONDERING HOW THAT

01:33:07.415 --> 01:33:07.615
AFFECTS.

01:33:07.682 --> 01:33:09.116
OUR SERVICE BASED ECONOMY IN

01:33:09.183 --> 01:33:11.519
CHINA AND AROUND THE WORLD.

01:33:11.585 --> 01:33:13.020
THERE'S A SHIFTED TO DIFFERENT

01:33:13.087 --> 01:33:15.523
COUNTRIES THIS ISSUE AND AND AND

01:33:15.589 --> 01:33:16.958
WHY HEARD WAS ALARMING IS THAT.

01:33:17.024 --> 01:33:19.226
SOME COMPANIES TO STOP PRODUCING.

01:33:19.293 --> 01:33:23.064
PRODUCTS THAT ALSO INCLUDES

01:33:23.130 --> 01:33:25.399
SERVICES THANK YOU.

01:33:25.466 --> 01:33:26.834
GREAT ANYBODY WANNA.

01:33:26.901 --> 01:33:27.435
JUMP IN I COULD TRY TO TAKE A

01:33:27.501 --> 01:33:29.170
STAB AT THE TERROR OF QUICK IN --

01:33:29.236 --> 01:33:31.339
AND I THINK IT'S FOR IT IF I

01:33:31.405 --> 01:33:32.006
COULD HAVE A KIND OF TERROR FREE

01:33:32.073 --> 01:33:32.974
ZONE. ONE OF THE HALLMARKS OF

01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:35.343
THE WTO WHICH THE UNITED STATES

01:33:35.409 --> 01:33:37.244
SET UP AFTER WORLD WAR TWO FIRST

01:33:37.311 --> 01:33:37.812
IN THE GENERAL AGREEMENT ON

01:33:37.878 --> 01:33:39.313
TARIFFS AND TRADE GATT AND THE

01:33:39.380 --> 01:33:40.881
WTO WAS.

01:33:40.948 --> 01:33:42.917
THIS IDEA THAT COUNTRIES SHOULD

01:33:42.984 --> 01:33:45.052
NOT DISCRIMINATE ON TERRORISTS

01:33:45.119 --> 01:33:45.586
FROM OTHER COUNTRIES THERE

01:33:45.653 --> 01:33:47.254
SHOULD BE MOST FAVORED NATION

01:33:47.321 --> 01:33:47.855
WHICH JUST MEANS A NORMAL HER

01:33:47.922 --> 01:33:49.023
FLAVEL.

01:33:49.090 --> 01:33:50.858
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE

01:33:50.925 --> 01:33:51.459
SECTION THREE ONE TERRACE DO

01:33:51.525 --> 01:33:53.194
THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION IS ON

01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:55.096
IS AGAINST THE RULES OF THE WTO

01:33:55.162 --> 01:33:56.797
AND SO THOSE WTO RULES PROHIBIT

01:33:56.864 --> 01:33:58.833
CHINA SAYING.

01:33:58.899 --> 01:33:59.433
CALIFORNIA ALMONDS WILL HAVE

01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:01.135
ZERO TARIFF PERCENTAGE FOR YOU

01:34:01.202 --> 01:34:03.404
BUT ALMONDS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES

01:34:03.471 --> 01:34:04.905
WE'RE GONNA KEEP IT HIGH UNLESS

01:34:04.972 --> 01:34:05.573
THERE'S AN EXCEPTION FOR A FREE

01:34:05.639 --> 01:34:07.375
TRADE AGREEMENT SO THAT'S WHY

01:34:07.441 --> 01:34:09.110
CHILEAN WINE.

01:34:09.176 --> 01:34:11.078
AND AUSTRALIAN LIKE IT'S COME

01:34:11.145 --> 01:34:11.712
INTO THE FREEZER SENATE'S HIGHER

01:34:11.779 --> 01:34:12.847
FREE TRADE AGREEMENT.

01:34:12.913 --> 01:34:15.016
SO UNLESS THE US AND CHINA HAD A

01:34:15.082 --> 01:34:15.649
FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WE COULDN'T

01:34:15.716 --> 01:34:17.151
KIND OF BRING THE STARS DOWN. TO

01:34:17.218 --> 01:34:19.120
ZERO I THINK THE THE OF THE

01:34:19.186 --> 01:34:19.754
OTHER AREA THAT YOU COULD LOOK

01:34:19.820 --> 01:34:21.255
AT IS ON INVESTMENT THAT IS

01:34:21.322 --> 01:34:22.790
OFTEN TIMES A TRADE INVESTMENT

01:34:22.857 --> 01:34:23.457
KIND OF GO HAND IN HAND YOU HAVE

01:34:23.524 --> 01:34:25.292
A PROCESSING FACILITY THAT'S

01:34:25.359 --> 01:34:27.261
PROCESSING ALMONDS.

01:34:27.328 --> 01:34:29.230
AND IF YOU INVEST IN THAT THAT

01:34:29.296 --> 01:34:29.830
HELPS THE SALE OF IT AND SO.

01:34:29.897 --> 01:34:30.831
ARE.

01:34:30.898 --> 01:34:33.367
ABOUT CHANGING RESTRICTIONS ON

01:34:33.434 --> 01:34:34.001
INVESTMENT I THINK SOME OF THE

01:34:34.068 --> 01:34:34.635
CHINESE I COULD LOOK AT AND ON

01:34:34.702 --> 01:34:35.336
OUR SIDE WE DON'T REALLY HAVE

01:34:35.403 --> 01:34:36.904
RESTRICTIONS ON INVESTMENT SO IT

01:34:36.971 --> 01:34:38.973
WOULD HAVE TO BE SOMETHING MAYBE

01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:39.640
MORE SYMBOLIC ON THE CALIFORNIA

01:34:39.707 --> 01:34:41.208
SOUGHT BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:34:41.275 --> 01:34:47.348
YOU COULD LOOK AT ALL.

01:34:47.415 --> 01:34:51.052

01:38:34.808 --> 01:38:37.144
SERIOUS WAY IN NOT.

01:38:37.211 --> 01:38:39.313
YOU KNOW AND SPECIFICALLY IN

01:38:39.380 --> 01:38:41.348

NATIONAL LEVEL.

01:39:09.710 --> 01:39:10.144
I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

01:39:10.210 --> 01:39:11.145
OPPORTUNITY AS WE GO FARTHER

01:39:11.211 --> 01:39:11.712
DOWN AND HAVE THE STATE OF

01:39:11.779 --> 01:39:13.447
CALIFORNIA BEING GAUGED -- AND

01:39:13.514 --> 01:39:15.282
THEN CITY TO CITY INVOLVEMENT I

01:39:15.349 --> 01:39:16.750
THINK WE ALSO HAVE TO REMEMBER

01:39:16.817 --> 01:39:17.418
THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE PEOPLE TO

01:39:17.484 --> 01:39:19.286
PEOPLE ENGAGEMENTS ARE WE CAN'T

01:39:19.353 --> 01:39:21.155

01:39:21.221 --> 01:39:23.691
IMPORTANT HOW YOU KNOW WHERE WE

01:39:23.757 --> 01:39:25.059

FROM CHINA INTO THE US AND U. S.

01:39:33.233 --> 01:39:35.402
STUDENTS GO TO STUDY -- IN CHINA

01:39:35.469 --> 01:39:36.770

01:39:36.837 --> 01:39:37.338
DIALOGUE WE HAVE TO CONTINUE

01:39:37.404 --> 01:39:39.139
TOURISM HAS TO CONTINUE SO I

01:39:39.206 --> 01:39:41.408
THINK WE NEED TO BUILD THE BONDS

01:39:41.475 --> 01:39:43.010
OF THE PEOPLE TO PEOPLE.

01:39:43.077 --> 01:39:45.379

POSSIBLE [INAUDIBLE]

01:41:23.243 --> 01:41:25.446
SO MY SUGGESTION A PROPOSAL WILL

01:41:25.512 --> 01:41:28.816
BE BASED ON ANOTHER SIMILAR.

01:41:28.882 --> 01:41:33.253
CASE BACK TO THE YEAR.

01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:33.787
TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THE ON

01:41:33.854 --> 01:41:35.189
DECEMBER NINTH -- I WAS INVITED

01:41:39.226 --> 01:41:41.395
LIKE THIS ONE AT THAT TIME THE

01:41:41.462 --> 01:41:43.664
CASE WAS WAS MUCH SMALLER SCALE.

01:41:43.730 --> 01:41:46.867
IT WAS IN THE SOLAR PANEL --

01:41:46.934 --> 01:41:51.405
DISPUTE BACK TO THAT TIME.

01:41:51.472 --> 01:41:53.340

01:42:05.786 --> 01:42:09.289
BIG IMPACT.

01:42:09.356 --> 01:42:10.891

01:42:31.078 --> 01:42:32.913

AS FOR ALL -- ZERO ELECTRIC

01:45:09.369 --> 01:45:09.970
VEHICLES ARE -- PROCESS THE PORT

01:45:10.037 --> 01:45:11.071
LOS ANGELES ONLY THROUGH THEIR

01:45:11.138 --> 01:45:13.073
THEIR OWN TAX STRUCTURE SO FROM

01:45:13.140 --> 01:45:13.674
A LOCAL LEVEL WAY TO DO THAT

01:45:13.740 --> 01:45:14.207
SAID I THINK -- IF WE CAN

01:45:14.274 --> 01:45:15.575
PARTNER WITH THE STATE OF

01:45:17.344 --> 01:45:19.246
OF THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL BUT NOT

01:45:19.312 --> 01:45:21.048

01:45:21.114 --> 01:45:21.682

CHINESE AMERICAN -- I SHARE THE

01:46:31.384 --> 01:46:31.651
PERSPECTIVE.

THAT THE TRAIN AND ECONOMIC

01:46:33.553 --> 01:46:34.121

IMPORTANT TO OUR ECONOMY TO OUR

01:46:37.824 --> 01:46:39.459

PERSPECTIVE -- THE TRAIN.

01:46:49.436 --> 01:46:51.238
THAT WAS STARTED BY THE OCCUPANT

01:46:51.304 --> 01:46:53.140

01:53:01.808 --> 01:53:05.111
CHALLENGING -- ENDEAVOR RIGHT

AND AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE

HEADLINES DON'T NECESSARILY

01:53:19.792 --> 01:53:23.296

01:53:27.667 --> 01:53:30.904
DO WANT TO ADDRESS A COUPLE

01:53:30.970 --> 01:53:31.538
THOUGHTS -- BEGIN W. CHART --

01:53:31.604 --> 01:53:33.506
CONSUL GENERAL RAN YOU FOR

01:53:37.477 --> 01:53:41.281
BUT AGAIN -- THE GOVERNOR'S

01:53:41.347 --> 01:53:43.249
CORRECT IN THAT THIS ISSUE IS

01:53:43.316 --> 01:53:45.418
ABOUT RECIPROCITY AND AND AND

01:53:45.485 --> 01:53:47.287
CALL GENERAL YOU ARE CORRECT

01:53:47.353 --> 01:53:47.520
ABOUT.

01:53:47.587 --> 01:53:49.289
THE RELATIONSHIP IS SHIFTED MUCH

01:53:49.355 --> 01:53:50.990
MORE TO SERVICES AND AND THAT

01:53:51.057 --> 01:53:53.226
HAS -- BEEN REFLECTED IN OUR

01:53:53.293 --> 01:53:54.827
MEMBERSHIP SHIFTING FROM

01:53:54.894 --> 01:54:05.305
MANUFACTURING OVER TO SERVICES.

01:54:05.371 --> 01:54:05.872
ASIAN SHIP DOES HAVE TO BE

01:54:05.939 --> 01:54:07.373
RECIPROCAL -- I THINK THAT -- AB

01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:09.275
CPAS TAKE EXAMPLE WHILE BROUGHT

01:54:09.342 --> 01:54:12.812
FORWARD -- BY MR GREEN WAS ABOUT

01:54:12.879 --> 01:54:13.379
OF ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS IN A

01:54:13.446 --> 01:54:15.582
SPECIFIC EXAMPLE THAT REFLECTS

01:54:15.648 --> 01:54:16.249
RIGHT HERE A FORM YOUR PAYPAL.

01:54:16.316 --> 01:54:17.450
SO PAYPAL ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS

01:54:17.517 --> 01:54:19.018
AGO AFTER THE CHINA MARKET FULLY

01:54:19.085 --> 01:54:23.189
EXPECTING TO TO ENJOY BY.

01:54:23.256 --> 01:54:25.191
RAMP UP ANY COMMERCE WITH CHINA.

01:54:25.258 --> 01:54:25.825
AFTER FIFTEEN YEARS WE'RE NEVER

01:54:25.892 --> 01:54:27.660
GRANTED A DOMESTIC LICENSE TO DO

01:54:27.727 --> 01:54:33.199
ARM BE TRANSACTIONS WITHIN CHINA.

01:54:33.266 --> 01:54:35.301
OUR TWENTY NINETEEN OF ALL THE

01:54:35.368 --> 01:54:37.337
PAY WE CHECK A ARE ENTERING

01:54:37.403 --> 01:54:37.904
CALIFORNIA ENTERING UNITED

01:54:37.971 --> 01:54:39.539
STATES WE WELCOME THAT

01:54:39.606 --> 01:54:40.974
ABSOLUTELY A GOOD THING.

01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:45.144
BUT IT'S A GLARING EXAMPLE OF OF

01:54:45.211 --> 01:54:45.612
LACK OF RECIPROCITY.

01:54:45.678 --> 01:54:47.313
I THINK CHINA WOULD DO WELL. TO

01:54:47.380 --> 01:54:50.817
LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE PS

01:54:50.883 --> 01:54:51.384
EXAMPLES AND WHAT I WOULD.

01:54:51.451 --> 01:54:55.021
CONSIDER LOW HANGING FRUIT --

01:54:55.088 --> 01:54:57.056
PAYPAL TRONIC PAYMENTS VISA.

01:54:57.123 --> 01:54:59.392
THE THINGS THAT -- THEY CAN

01:54:59.459 --> 01:54:59.859
ABSOLUTELY BE DONE.

01:54:59.926 --> 01:55:03.263
BUT BUT BOTTOM LINE -- WE HAVE A

01:55:03.329 --> 01:55:05.331
LOT OF RECOMMENDATIONS -- FOR

01:55:05.398 --> 01:55:06.933
THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT IN

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:07.600
TERMS OF HOW THEY'RE MATTER IN

01:55:07.667 --> 01:55:09.502
THIS THIS TRADE CONFLICT.

01:55:09.569 --> 01:55:11.571
OF WE AGREE WITH THE

01:55:11.638 --> 01:55:15.341
ADMINISTRATION THAT IT DOES NEED

01:55:15.408 --> 01:55:15.975
A ROOT OF TO BE REBALANCED.

01:55:16.042 --> 01:55:19.145
WE DON'T AGREE WITH WITH THE WAY

01:55:19.212 --> 01:55:19.712
THAT IT'S BEING DONE -- THE

01:55:19.779 --> 01:55:20.847
TERRORISTS.

01:55:20.913 --> 01:55:24.917
THE TERRORISTS AND THE WAY THAT

01:55:24.984 --> 01:55:28.988
THE ADMINISTRATION IS HANDLING

01:55:29.055 --> 01:55:31.291
THIS THIS IS NOT PRODUCTIVE.

01:55:31.357 --> 01:55:33.259
DRAGGING THIS ON FAR TOO LONG

01:55:33.326 --> 01:55:35.561
TERRORISTS DON'T HELP YOU.

01:55:35.628 --> 01:55:37.363
ONE AND WE'RE THERE IS DANGER OF

01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:38.965
UP DAMAGING.

01:55:39.032 --> 01:55:39.499
OF PERMANENTLY DAMAGING A

01:55:39.565 --> 01:55:40.033
RELATIONSHIP THAT HAS BEEN

01:55:40.099 --> 01:55:41.701
EXTREMELY PRODUCTIVE FOR THE

01:55:41.768 --> 01:55:42.101
LAST FORTY YEARS.

01:55:42.168 --> 01:55:45.371
BOTH FOR THE STATE'S AND FOR

01:55:45.438 --> 01:55:47.206
CHINA WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A UP

01:55:47.273 --> 01:55:49.242
A QUICK RESOLUTION TO TO THE

01:55:49.309 --> 01:55:51.177
CURRENT CONFLICT THANK YOU AGAIN

01:55:51.244 --> 01:55:51.811
FOR HAVING THIS VERY PRODUCTIVE

01:55:51.878 --> 01:55:55.181
SO I DID I DID HAVE ONE QUESTION.

01:55:55.248 --> 01:55:55.715
FOR FOR FOR YOU SINCE YOU

01:55:55.782 --> 01:55:57.517
MENTIONED THE WHOLE ELECTRONIC

01:55:57.583 --> 01:55:58.151
PAYMENT ISSUE I NOTICED WHEN I

01:55:58.217 --> 01:56:05.158
WAS IN CHINA LAST TO SEE HER.

01:56:05.224 --> 01:56:07.293
AS A TOURIST HOW.

01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:11.230
HOW FEW PEOPLE ACTUALLY TO CASH?

01:56:11.297 --> 01:56:15.268
IT WAS WEIRD TO PRESCRIBE LIKE I

01:56:15.335 --> 01:56:19.305
I CAN'T GET THE PAY -- USE

01:56:19.372 --> 01:56:21.407
CHAPTER PAYS SO WE'RE FOR

01:56:21.474 --> 01:56:22.008
TOURISM HAVE YOU SEEN OR HAVE

01:56:22.075 --> 01:56:23.376
YOU HEARD COMPLAINTS FOR FOR

01:56:23.443 --> 01:56:26.913
TOURISTS.

01:56:26.979 --> 01:56:27.480
I FIGURE OUT HOW DO YOU BUY

01:56:27.547 --> 01:56:29.182
THINGS HOW DO YOU PAY FOR THINGS.

01:56:29.248 --> 01:56:29.816
YEAH WE HAVE A BE THAT THAT IS

01:56:29.882 --> 01:56:31.384
SO THAT IS A COMMON COMPLAINT TO

01:56:31.451 --> 01:56:31.784
THINK CHINA IS.

01:56:31.851 --> 01:56:33.319
IS BECOMING MUCH MORE INWARD

01:56:33.386 --> 01:56:33.920
LOOKING AT THIS IS A POLITICAL

01:56:33.986 --> 01:56:34.554
QUESTION IT'S A DOMESTIC ISSUE

01:56:34.620 --> 01:56:35.722
WITHIN CHINA THAT THAT THEY NEED

01:56:35.788 --> 01:56:36.022
TO RESOLVE.

01:56:36.089 --> 01:56:37.290
AND THEY NEED TO FIGURE OUT

01:56:37.357 --> 01:56:37.924
EXACTLY HOW TIGHTLY INTEGRATED

01:56:37.990 --> 01:56:39.058
THEY WANT TO BE.

01:56:39.125 --> 01:56:41.361
WITH THE REST OF THE GLOBAL

01:56:41.427 --> 01:56:42.829
COMMUNITY BUT YOU'RE RIGHT THAT --

01:56:42.895 --> 01:56:44.997
IT IS DIFFICULT FOR TOURISTS AND

01:56:45.064 --> 01:56:45.631
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR FOREIGN

01:56:45.698 --> 01:56:47.266
BUSINESSES OPERATING IN CHINA

01:56:47.333 --> 01:56:51.137
HAVING SAID THAT -- I WOULD ADD

01:56:51.204 --> 01:56:53.172
JUST A LITTLE BIT OF NEW WANTS

01:56:53.239 --> 01:56:53.806
TO WHAT THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR

01:56:53.873 --> 01:56:56.843
AND HER SON OF MENTIONED ABOUT

01:56:56.909 --> 01:56:59.412
ABOUT THE MOOD IN CHINA WITH

01:56:59.479 --> 01:57:01.114
RESPECT TO AMERICAN BUSINESSES

01:57:01.180 --> 01:57:01.347
THERE.

01:57:01.414 --> 01:57:03.516
OVERALL ESPECIALLY AT THE LAW

01:57:03.583 --> 01:57:04.917
SCHOOL THE MUNICIPAL LEVEL AND

01:57:04.984 --> 01:57:07.286
PROVINCIAL LEVEL THE GOVERNMENT

01:57:07.353 --> 01:57:09.255
IS ACTUALLY VERY VERY WELCOMING

01:57:09.322 --> 01:57:09.822
OF AMERICAN BUSINESSES AND

01:57:09.889 --> 01:57:10.890
AMERICAN INVESTMENT.

01:57:10.957 --> 01:57:13.126
THE CONFLICT IS REALLY AT THE

01:57:13.192 --> 01:57:15.228
BEIJING WASHINGTON LEVEL AND SO

01:57:15.294 --> 01:57:17.296
THAT'S THAT'S REALLY PROBLEMATIC

01:57:17.363 --> 01:57:20.733
SECOND -- THE MOOD VERY MUCH

01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:24.737
SHIFTED POST WHILE WAY -- THE

01:57:24.804 --> 01:57:25.371
MOOD EARLIER SO IN OTHER WORDS

01:57:25.438 --> 01:57:27.607
THIS NEGATIVE SENTIMENT THAT THE

01:57:27.673 --> 01:57:31.277
TENANT GOVERNOR MENTIONED. FOR

01:57:31.344 --> 01:57:33.413
TWO WAS -- DID NOT START AT THE

01:57:33.479 --> 01:57:35.114
BEGINNING OF THIS THE SO CALLED

01:57:35.181 --> 01:57:43.055
TRADE WAR IT STARTED.

01:57:43.122 --> 01:57:43.423
MUCH MORE POST.

01:57:43.489 --> 01:57:45.224
A TENTH AFTER THE WALK AWAY AND

01:57:45.291 --> 01:57:49.162
CERTAINLY AFTER THE RESTORATION

01:57:49.228 --> 01:57:49.729
PUT AWAY ON THE END LIST.

01:57:49.796 --> 01:57:50.797
BEFORE THAT.

01:57:50.863 --> 01:57:53.099
I WOULD SAY THAT THAT WE HAD

01:57:53.166 --> 01:57:53.599
QUITE A LOT OF SUPPORT.

01:57:53.666 --> 01:57:55.334
THE CHINESE PEOPLE FOR

01:57:55.401 --> 01:57:55.968
LEGITIMATE REFORM WITHIN CHINA

01:57:56.035 --> 01:57:59.105
THAT WAS PROMPTED BY A

01:57:59.172 --> 01:57:59.772
REBALANCING OF THE RELATIONSHIP

01:57:59.839 --> 01:58:01.441
MOST PEOPLE MIGHT MY CHINESE

01:58:01.507 --> 01:58:03.176
FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES IN PEOPLE

01:58:03.242 --> 01:58:03.643
THAT I INTERACT WITH.

01:58:03.709 --> 01:58:05.244
AND EVEN AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:58:05.311 --> 01:58:07.680
LEVEL WE'RE ACTUALLY SUPPORT OF

01:58:07.747 --> 01:58:08.881
A REBALANCING OF THE

01:58:08.948 --> 01:58:11.050
RELATIONSHIP THAT ENTIRELY

01:58:11.117 --> 01:58:13.352
SHIFTED AFTER -- WHILE WE WERE

01:58:13.419 --> 01:58:14.887
PLACED ON ENTITIES LIST.

01:58:14.954 --> 01:58:17.056
BECAUSE THERE'S A VERY DIFFERENT

01:58:17.123 --> 01:58:17.690
THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS

01:58:17.757 --> 01:58:19.192
WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHILE WAY IN

01:58:19.258 --> 01:58:20.960
THE NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE ONE

01:58:21.027 --> 01:58:21.127
IS.

01:58:21.194 --> 01:58:23.262
MAKING A LEGITIMATE NATIONAL

01:58:23.329 --> 01:58:27.099
SECURITY DECISION. TO TO

01:58:27.166 --> 01:58:29.001
RESTRICT WHAT PRODUCTS AND

01:58:29.068 --> 01:58:31.103
TECHNOLOGIES ARE EMBEDDED IN OUR

01:58:31.170 --> 01:58:31.504
TELECOMMUNICATIONS

01:58:31.571 --> 01:58:33.072
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S ONE

01:58:33.139 --> 01:58:35.007
QUESTION.

01:58:35.074 --> 01:58:35.575
THE SECOND QUESTION IS AN

01:58:35.641 --> 01:58:37.009
EXISTENTIAL QUESTION ABOUT

01:58:37.076 --> 01:58:39.378
SHOULD WE ALLOW ONE WAY TO EVEN

01:58:39.445 --> 01:58:41.180
EXIST.

01:58:41.247 --> 01:58:41.714
AND BY PLACING IT ON THE

01:58:41.781 --> 01:58:43.382
ENTITIES LIST AND DOING IT IN

01:58:43.449 --> 01:58:47.653
SUCH SUCH AN OF AN AFFRONT.

01:58:47.720 --> 01:58:49.355
IN IN SUCH A WAY THAT WAS SO

01:58:49.422 --> 01:58:51.057
ABRUPT AND FRANKLY ROUTE.

01:58:51.123 --> 01:58:53.326
IT REALLY IT IT SHOWED THE

01:58:53.392 --> 01:58:53.993
CHINESE PEOPLE THAT THE UNITED

01:58:54.060 --> 01:58:57.163
STATES GOVERNMENT WAS ACTUALLY

01:58:57.230 --> 01:58:57.797
POSITIONING ITSELF AS AN ENEMY.

01:58:57.864 --> 01:59:00.967
AND WANTED TO DESTROY.

01:59:01.033 --> 01:59:02.869
A LEGITIMATE COMPANY THAT
