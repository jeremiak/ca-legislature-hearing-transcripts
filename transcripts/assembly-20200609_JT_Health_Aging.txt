THAT I UNDERSTAND HOW HARD THE ADMINISTRATION IS WORKING. TO RESPOND TO THE KOBE NINETEEN CRISIS. HOWEVER VERY CONCERNED. LET OUR MOST VULNERABLE CITIZENS DOWN. FAR TOO MANY SKILLED NURSING FACILITY RESIDENTS HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES TO COOPER DIED NINETEEN AND I KNOW WE CAN DO BETTER. THE MOST RECENT DATA ON THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WEBSITE SHOWS THAT ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY RESIDENTS HAVE DIED. ONE IS TOO MANY. BUT THAT REMINDS US THAT EVERYONE OF THOSE DEATHS FROM REPRESENTS MORE GRIEVING FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS THAT DEVASTATING NUMBER REPRESENTS ALMOST HALF THE DEATHS IN THE STATE DO THIS PANDEMIC. THESE FRAIL SENIORS ARE IN A NURSING HOME BECAUSE THEY MUST RELY ON OTHERS FOR THEIR CARE AND SAFETY AND BECAUSE OF THEIR CLOSE LIVING CONDITIONS THEIR VULNERABILITY REQUIRES US TO MAKE SURE THESE FACILITIES ARE SAFE AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE AND AS WERE HERE TODAY. DR PLEA TO ACT IMMEDIATELY ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO TO PROTECT THEM. ASSEMBLYMEMBER ARIAN ARE AGING AND LONG TERM CARE COMMITTEE CHAIR AND I HAVE BROUGHT TOGETHER STATE REGULATORS.

OF EACH OTHER. ASSEMBLYMAN IT NEEDS AREA WOULD LIKE TO WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE SOME OPENING REMARKS. SURE. THANK YOU TO MY FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE- DOCTOR WOULD- THIS OVERSIGHT IS- THIS OVERSIGHT HEARING IS NECESSARY AND TODAY'S OUT CRIMES OUTCOMES CAN. HOPEFULLY LEAD TO- SAVING LIVES AGAIN THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUES TO JOIN ME TODAY FROM THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH AND AGING AND LONG TERM CARE COMMITTEES. THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF OUR SENIORS AND THE DISABLED ARE OF HIGH IMPORTANCE TO ALL OF US IN THIS ROOM AS COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THINK- BUDGET CHAIRS AND COLLEAGUES ASSEMBLY MEMBER STAINED. AND ARAMBULA FOR JOINING US TODAY AS WELL AS- SOME OF OUR OTHER COLLEAGUES FROM OUR- COMMITTEES. FROM THE EARLIEST DAYS OF KOBE NINETEEN WE KNEW. IT HAS THE GREATEST IMPACT ON SENIORS AND THE DISABLED. THIS WAS EVIDENT IN THE OUTBREAKS IN CHINA SPREADING TO EUROPE AND IN THE STATE'S HIT HARDEST EARLY ON IN THE US. AND YET OUR POLICIES AND RECOMMENDATIONS RELATING TO KEEPING OUR MOST VULNERABLE SENIORS SAFE. DO NOT SEEM TO USE LESSONS LEARNED. WE HAVE CONTINUED TO USE RHETORIC TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. WORDS CANNOT KEEP SENIORS IN SKILLED NURSING SAFE. INFLECTION CANNOT KEEP CARE GIVERS SAFE OR EFFECTIVELY TRAIN EXISTING STAFF TO ADDRESS THE INFECTION PROTOCOLS WE RECOMMEND. WE NEED MORE THAN SPEECHES SAYING WE CARE WE NEED ACTION. WE NEED TO DEMAND BETTER. SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES ARE FILLED WITH OUR MOTHERS AND FATHERS AND GRAND PARENTS AND SIBLINGS THESE PATIENTS HAVE FOUGHT WARS TO DEFEND OUR FREEDOMS LIVE DURING AND CAME OUT OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION AND BUILT OUR ECONOMY AND THE DESERVE BETTER. WE ARE BRINGING THIS VIRUS TO THEM WE ARE TRADING AND SHARING THIS VIRUS WITH THEIR CARE GIVERS. WE UNDERSTAND HOW THIS VIRUS SPREADS AND YET WE HAVE ISOLATED THE SENIOR SENIORS AND THEY'RE DYING ALONE BECAUSE WE ARE NOT DOING ENOUGH. PERHAPS IN REFLECTION WE CAN FINALLY ACKNOWLEDGE COVERT NINETEEN DIDN'T CAUSE THESE PROBLEMS BUT DRAMATICALLY REVEALED THE SHORTCOMINGS IN CALIFORNIA'S LONG TERM SUPPORT SERVICES SYSTEM. INCLUDING THE LONGSTANDING PERVASIVE CHALLENGES FACING CALIFORNIA'S LICENSED FACILITIES. THE FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND RESIDENTS OF SKILLED NURSING FACILITY AND RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY ARE AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE TO THE VIRUS YET WE HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT ISSUES ARISE INCLUDING LACK OF ACCESS TO PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. LACK OF CONSISTENT TESTING OF RESIDENTS AND STAFF CHALLENGES WITH INFECTION CONTROL AND LACK OF AN OVERALL STATEWIDE STRATEGY. THE BROADER ISSUE IS UNFORTUNATELY NOT A NEW ONE IT IS ROOTED IN OUR COLLECTIVE FAILURE TO MAKE IT A PRIORITY TO TRANSFORM THE SYSTEM OF CARE FOR OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. WE HAVE UNDER VALUED AND UNDER PAID THE DIRECT CARE WORK FORCE. WE HAVE PROVIDED INCONSISTENT OVERSIGHT OF OUR INSTITUTIONAL AND RESIDENTIAL CARE SETTINGS. AND WE LACK SUFFICIENT COMMUNITY BASED ALTERNATIVES FOR PEOPLE WHO WOULD PREFER TO REMAIN AT HOME. THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION'S. NINETEEN NINETY SIX REPORT ON CALIFORNIA'S LONG TERM CARE SYSTEM. CALLED OUT MANY OF THESE SAME ISSUES SOME TWENTY FOUR YEARS AGO. THE STATE'S CURRENT OVERSIGHT STRUCTURE IS TOO FRAGMENTED TO ALLOW EFFECTIVE COORDINATION AND INTEGRATION OF LONG TERM CARE SERVICES THE STATE'S POLICIES FAVOR EXPENSIVE INSTITUTIONALIZATION AT THE EXPENSE OF HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES PERFORMED A PREFERRED BY CONSUMERS CONSUMERS CONTINUE. TO TAKE ISSUE WITH THE QUALITY OF CARE AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND REGULATORY CHANGE HAS NOT KEPT PACE WITH THE CHANGING DEMANDS PLACED ON RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES. ALL SEEM TO COMMON THESE DAYS AS WELL. SO WHY HASN'T MUCH HAPPENED FOR OVER TWENTY FOUR YEARS UNFORTUNATELY OUR FAILURE TO ACT STEMS FROM A MUCH LARGER PROBLEM ROOTED IN PERVASIVE SOCIETAL AGEISM AND ABLE ISM THAT HAS NOT PRIORITIZE THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS OLDER ADULTS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND CARE GIVERS. WE SHOULD ADD TO THIS ALSO THE DRIVE OF PROFITEERING. AS A BODY WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE THESE ISSUES AND INVEST IN INNOVATION. AND WE NEED TO CHANGE THE CULTURE OF AGEISM. IF WE ARE NOT USING THIS TIME TO DEMAND CHANGE THEN WHEN. PRIOR TO COVERT NINETEEN WE DISCUSSED THE NEEDS OF THE GROWING POPULATION OF SENIORS AND WHAT THAT WILL LOOK LIKE IN TEN YEARS. BUT OUR INACTION AND WEAK FOUNDATIONS RELATING TO SENIORS AND THE DISABLED COMPOUNDED WITH COVERT NINETEEN WILL CONTINUE TO DECREASE THE NUMBERS OF SENIORS. IN OUR STATE AND NATION AT A TIME WHEN THERE'S GONNA BE HISTORICAL GROWTH OF THAT AGE POPULATION. THE MAY REVISED IS AN EXAMPLE OF AGEISM. IT ON FAIRLY BALANCED CALIFORNIA'S BUDGET ON THE SHOULDERS OF OUR FRAIL ELDERLY ELDERLY AND DISABLED. IT IS A PROPOSAL THAT IS UNJUST AND UNFAIR. I'M PROUD OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL WE WILL BE VOTING ON WITHIN A WEEK. OUR VALUES ARE CLEAR WE WILL NOT FURTHER HARM SENIORS AND THE DISABLED IT IS SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE. AS THIS OVERSIGHT HEARING CONTINUES I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM ALL OF YOU YOUR PERSPECTIVES ARE UNIQUE AND IMPORTANT TO THIS CONVERSATION WE MUST DO BETTER BECAUSE IN THE END WHO IS HARMED MOSTLY BY ALL OF THIS. WE ALL ARE THE RESIDENTS OF THESE HOMES ARE FAMILIES. AND IT'S TIME FOR A CHANGE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER IN HIS AREA AND I'D I DO WANT TO KNOW- WE HAVE DOCTOR JOAQUIN ARAMBULA HERE ARE THE BUDGET CHAIR FOR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES OR SUB COMMITTEE CHAIR- THE MYSTERY SOUTH WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ANY COMMENTS. I'M SORRY WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE A COMMON STOCK REGULAR. I'LL LET YOU GUYS DO IT OUT NOW WHAT WE'LL GO WITH HIM FIRST MY APOLOGIES THAT WAS. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULDN'T THANK YOU- MISTER NAZARIAN FOR HOSTING THIS HEARING TODAY AND FOR WRITING ME AS CHAIR OF A JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE- TO PARTICIPATE- OBVIOUSLY WITH THE NEWLY RELEASED DATA WE'VE SEEN- THAT NEARLY TWENTY SIX THOUSAND NURSING HOME RESIDENTS OF DIED FROM COVERT NINETEEN IN MORE THAN SIXTY THOUSAND OF FALLEN ILL. IN CALIFORNIA DATA FROM FROM THE PUBLIC HEALTH SURE THAT AT LEAST NINE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED NURSING HOME RESIDENTS THIS. AND STAFF OF CONTRACTED- COVERT NINETEEN AND ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVEN AT DIED- THUS FAR. BUT LET ME TELL YOU IN KERN COUNTY WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN AN OUTBREAK IN NURSING FACILITIES IN THIS KIND OF HITS VERY CLOSE TO HOME. BECAUSE OF MY UNCLE WAS ACTUALLY AT ONE OF THESE NURSING FACILITIES. BREAKS OF. LEVEL WE WERE FIRST LOOKING AT THIS- I WAS GETTING THESE FRANTIC CALLS AND TAX BECAUSE THEY WERE HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING THEIR STAFF TO EVEN SHOW UP AND THE RESPONSE FROM THE STATE'S SEEM VERY SLOW WHEN THEY WERE- PLEADING PLEADING FOR HELP BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE STAFF SHOWING UP TO EVEN HELP PEOPLE GET OUT OF BED OR TO. ASSIST THEM IN THEIR DAILY LIVES AND DAILY FUNCTIONS AND SO I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO TODAY'S HEARING- WHAT DID THE WHAT WAS THE STATE'S RESPONSE HOW WERE WE MEETING PP- WHAT WERE YOU DOING TO THE FAMILY LOOK AT YOU AS A FAMILY MEMBER WE WERE REALLY SEARCHING FOR ANSWERS AND WE REALLY SEARCHING FOR SOME GUIDELINES OF CLARITY WHAT IS BEING DONE WHAT CAN BE DONE. BUT WILL ONLY HEARING FROM IN CASE MY UNCLE WAS SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT NOBODY SHOWED UP FOR THE PAST TWELVE HOURS OR TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND IT'S NOT JUST ME THE ENTIRE FACILITY AND- THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS HEARING I'M LOOKING FOR TO SOME REAL ANSWERS IN REAL TRYING TO THEN WE WERE FROM PAST PERIODS AS WEATHER WAS WITH THINGS LIKE MERCY. WHY WE DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC GUIDELINES IN PLACE. WHY DON'T WE IS IN PLACE I WHY ARE WE FOR THESE TYPES OF INCIDENCES AND THESE OUTBREAKS IN WHAT. WERE WAS A- WHERE WAS THE HELP. IF WE KNEW SOMETHING LIKE THIS WAS COMING IN ESPECIALLY WHEN WE SEE ONE OUT OF EVERY FIVE NURSING FACILITY IS HAS HAD SOME INCIDENTS WITH THE CORONAVIRUS AND WITH KOVIN SO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE TODAY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO TODAY SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH ATTRACT ARAMBULA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- WE START BY TAKING THAT OFF IF I MAY AND MAY REMIND OUR COLLEAGUES TO PUT THEM BACK ON AFTER WE CITY AND SO- FIRST I WANT TO SPEAK FOR WHY I CARE SO MUCH ABOUT THE ELDERLY AND I'VE SHARED THIS WITH YOU BEFORE MISTER CHAIR BUT- AND IT'S NOT. INHERENTLY BECAUSE MY MOTHER BECAME ELDERLY THIS YEAR AT THE AGE OF SIXTY FIVE BUT AS A LEGAL AID LAWYER FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS SHE STOOD UP FOR THOSE WHO WERE ELDERLY AND DISABLED AND LACKING SUFFICIENT ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND SO I SHARE YOUR CONCERN MISTER CHAIR FOR THE MOST. IT'S THE REASON WHY I'VE BEEN CARING FOR THINGS LIKE THE SENIOR PENALTY AND WHAT I WANTED TO COME TO TODAY'S HEARING TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE HAD A VERY IMPORTANT DISCUSSION TODAY IN THE MOMENT ABOUT HOW WE RISE OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC STRONGER THAN WE WENT IN. BECAUSE I ALSO WANT TO AGREE WITH CHAIR IN THIS AREA AND WHEN HE SAID THAT WE HAVE NOT HAD SUFFICIENT OVERSIGHT. THAT WE LACK SUFFICIENT COMMUNITY SETTINGS FOR US TO BE ABLE TO AGE IN PLACE WITH DIGNITY. AND OUR SYSTEM IS TOO FRAGMENTED. WE HAVE TWELVE HUNDRED SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES WE HAVE ROUGHLY A HUNDRED AND NINETEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THOSE FACILITIES. I CHALLENGE US AS A LEGISLATURE TO COME UP WITH THE SYSTEM THAT WORKS FOR OUR AGING POPULATION FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN MEET THAT CHALLENGE AND THINK THAT PART OF IT MUST BE A DISCUSSION ABOUT FINANCING. I THINK WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR PRIORITIES AS A STATE ARE PUT FRONT AND CENTER AND THAT WE STAND UP FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE. FOR OUR ELDERS AND FOR THOSE WHO CANNOT BE E FIGHT ON THIS FLOOR TODAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. VERY MUCH WITH. ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF LIKE TO SPEAK THIS HAVE ANY OPENING COMMENTS BEFORE WE START. OKAY SEEMS TO SEE NO ONE THEN WHAT WE WILL DO IS WE WILL TURN TO OUR PANELISTS- WE WILL ASK EACH PANELIST IS WILL THEY WILL HAVE EACH THREE TO FOUR MINUTES FOR OPENING REMARKS ALASKAN TO SELF INTRODUCED AND WHAT I'VE MY PLAN IS TO GO THROUGH BOTH PANELS JUST STRAIGHT THROUGH. THEY WILL- ALLOW MEMBERS TO- ASKED SOME QUESTIONS BUT THIS IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT APPROACH ANY HEARING I WANT THE PANELISTS TO ASK QUESTIONS OF ONE ANOTHER AS WELL. ONCE AFTER WE HAVE SOME QUESTIONS- AND- I THINK THAT WILL BE A VERY INTERESTING DISCUSSION AND- AND HOPEFULLY A VERY FREE FLOWING DISCUSSION SO. AT THIS POINT I'D LIKE TO TURN OVER TO OUR FIRST OUR FIRST PANELIST. AND ASK THEM TO SELF INTRODUCE AND GIVE US THREE FOUR MINUTES IN YOUR OPEN REMARKS. GOOD MORNING I'M HEIDI SIDE OF HER AND THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OVER AT C. PH OVER THE CENTER FOR HEALTH CARE QUALITY. WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE BOTH FOR THE LICENSURE AND CERTIFICATION SURVEYORS- WHO ARE OVER THE OVERSIGHT OF THESE FACILITIES AS WELL AS- THE HEALTHCARE ASSOCIATED INFECTIONS- STRIKE TEAMS OF PEOPLE THEY ARE INFECTION DISEASE- SPECIALIST WHO GO INTO FACILITIES TO TRY TO MINUTE. TO MINIMIZE OUTBREAKS. OF I FIRST CAME TO THE STATE DECEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN I ACTUALLY CAME ALL THE WAY OVER FROM GERMANY. SO THAT I COULD BE PART OF A SYSTEM TO REFORM HOW CALIFORNIA DOES THEIR QUALITY AND SAFETY OVERSIGHT. I'M I'M A FIRM BELIEVER THAT WE ARE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AND THEREFORE WE SHOULD BE THINKING BIGGER AND DIFFERENTLY. ON THE ENTIRE NATION HAS BEEN HIT BY THIS PANDEMIC. THE ENTIRE NATION ALL FIFTY STATES USE THE SAME EXACT CMS MODEL. WHICH IS THAT YOU GO INTO A FACILITY ONCE A YEAR. OR IF IT'S A HOSPITAL THREE TIMES YEAR BUT IN THE CASE OF LONG TERM FACILITIES THE CMS MODEL ACROSS ALL FIFTY STATES. IF YOU DO ONE SURVEY ONCE A YEAR AND THEN OTHER THAN THAT IT'S ABOUT IN INVESTIGATIONS FOR COMPLAINTS AND- THE RIVER INSTANCE. AND I AM HERE TO SAY THAT IT'S NOT. AND I THINK IF ANYTHING THIS PANDEMIC IS HIGHLIGHTED NOT ONLY THE INEQUITIES IN OUR HEALTH CARE. ALSO THE DIVISION THAT DOES WITH THE NATIONAL HEALTH QUALITY SAFETY OVER LIKE SYSTEMS. EVERY SINGLE STATE HAS BEEN LOOKING AT PP EVERY STATE HAS FOCUSED ON STAFFING AND INFECTION CONTROL. AND WE HAVE DONE SO MUCH IN CALIFORNIA TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES HERE. WHETHER IT WAS IN ACTING OUR MEDICAL HEALTH COORDINATION CENTER ON JANUARY TWENTY FOURTH WHERE WE HAVE ALL BEEN WORKING SEVEN DAYS A WEEK- TWENTY FOUR SEVEN- FOR RESPONSE. OF EFFORTS TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE HAS THE TOOLS AND RESOURCES THEY NEED. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THEN WE START TO DO IMMEDIATE OUTREACH WITH ALL OF OUR FACILITIES JANUARY TWENTY EIGHTH WE STARTED A WEEKLY ALL FACILITIES CALL FOR ALL LETTER THOUSAND. BUILDINGS THAT WE OVERSEE FOR Q. AND TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE REAL TIME GUIDED. WE'VE ISSUED OVER SIXTY PIECES OF GUIDANCE- AND POLICIES ACROSS ALL OF OUR FACILITIES. TO JACK TO PUT MORE NORMAL YEAR YOU NORMALLY SPEND ABOUT MAYBE TWENTY TO THIRTY. WE'VE GOT SIXTY IN ABOUT THREE MONTHS- BUT WE GUYS WASN'T ENOUGH WE NEEDED ON SITE VISIT PRESENT NOT. BE PHYSICAL. IT IS STILL. TO BE ABLE INSPECTION BE ABLE TO. KIND OF THE- SO IN FEBRUARY WE WENT AHEAD AND WE READER ALL SIX OF SERVER INTO FACILITIES DID YOU SEE HIM IN FACT CONTROL. AS WELL AS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND TRY TO PREVENT- TRY TO GIVE EDUCATION THIS IS THE ARENA WHERE WE KNEW THAT THERE WAS A LACK OF EDUCATION THERE IS A HIGH TURNOVER RATE OF STAFF. AND THERE ARE A LOT A LOT OF INFORMATION LIKE DONNING AND DOFFING AND PEOPLE BEING COMFORTABLE WITH THOSE PROCESSES SO WE DID A LOT OF PREVENTION A LOT OF WEBINARS ONE OF ON ON ON SITE VISITS AT THAT TIME. WE ALSO THEN TRIPLED THE SAUCE. OR HEALTH CARE AT- ACQUIRED INFECTIONS TEAM BY REDIRECTING SOME OF OUR NURSES AND TRAINING THEM AND I KEEP PRACTICES. THAT THEY COULD BE PART OF THE STRIKE TEAMS THAT GO IN AFTER IT. THERE IS ONE CASE THAT WE CAN BE ABLE TO START TO MINIMIZE THE OUTBREAK AS FAST AS POSSIBLE BY DOING CONTACT TRACING EXPOSURES WORKING LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH FOR TESTING. BUT AGAIN AS TIME AND TIME WERE ON WE REALIZED THAT PP STAFFING EDUCATION GOING ON SITE. IT JUST SIMPLY WASN'T A NOT PEOPLE WERE STILL HAVING CASES. PEOPLE WERE STILL DYING. AND SO THAT IS WHY THE OF RELEASED- NOW A STATEWIDE SIX STRATEGY PLAN FOR CALIFORNIA. ONLY AN ACT OF THIS PLAN BACK IN MAY SOME OF THESE STRATEGIES ARE THINGS THAT WE HAD BEEN WORKING ON OVER THE LAST YEAR BUT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EXPEDITE THEM THROUGH THE EXISTING YOU KNOW PROCESS. AND SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE NEW AND BRAND NEW NOT ONLY TO CALIFORNIA BUT THERE WILL BE A BRAND NEW TO THE NATION. I A PROPOSED THESE SIX STRATEGIES TO SEE EN MASSE THEY ARE VERY INTERESTED AS WELL BECAUSE THEY ALSO RECOGNIZE. IT AS A NATION THERE IS TO DO. SO THE STRATEGY THAT I WANTED OVER FIRST AND FOR TESTING WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO KNOW WHERE IT IS AT ALL TIMES. SO WE HAVE REQUIRED ALL OF OUR FACILITIES TO DO BASELINE TESTING WHICH MEANS. ALL STAFF ALL RESIDENTS MUST BE TESTED BY JUNE THIRTIETH. AND THEY HAVE TO REPORT THOSE TESTING RESULTS TO US AND WE POST THEM ON OUR WEBSITE THEN AFTER THAT THERE IS A POSITIVE CASE JUST ONE POSITIVE CASE THE WILL DO REPEAT TESTING FOR EVERYONE THAT FACILITY EVERY WEEK. UP IF THEY HAVE ZERO POSITIVES THAN THEY WILL DO SURVEILLANCE TESTING OF ALL THE HEALTHCARE WORKERS 25% A WEEK UNTIL YOU HAVE ALL OF THE HEALTHCARE WORKERS ONCE A MONTH GETTING TESTED. UP THE SECOND STRATEGY IS REALLY ABOUT FAXING PREVENTION WORK FORCE- SO WE REALIZE THAT. MANY FACILITIES ONLY HAVE A PART TIME I KEY. IN THERE- IN THEIR SKILLED NURSING FACILITY WHICH IS NOT ENOUGH AND MANY OF THEM HAVE MULTIPLE HATS WHAT ROLES THEY HAVE TO KERRY. SO WE ALSO ISSUED AN AFL THAT STATES THAT EVERY SNAP IN CALIFORNIA MUST HAVE A FULL TIME INFECTION PREVENTION THIS. OF WHETHER THEY HAVE TWO PEOPLE TOGETHER OF THAT ARE THEN TRAINED EITHER BY OUR STAFF WE'VE OFFERED TRAINING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT TO GET THEM SOME COMPETENCY TESTING. OF BUT THAT IS A MUST. OF THE THIRD STRATEGY THAT WE ARE WORKING ON OPERATIONALLY SCENE IS JUST SHEER EDUCATION NOT ONLY RE EDUCATING ALL OF OUR SURVEYORS ON. PARTICULAR I. T. OF HIGH INFECTIOUS DISEASES BUT ALSO WORKING WITH ALL OF THE AN ACE LPN. RN OUT THERE IN THESE FACILITIES. OF FOR. IS SOMETHING THAT IS BRAND NEW TO THE NATION AND THIS IS COMPLETELY CHANGING AND REFORMING HOW WE WOULD DO QUALITY SAFETY OVERSIGHT. SO IN LIEU OF. OR IN ADDITION TO THAT ONCE A YEAR CMS CERTIFICATION. SURVEY IN ADDITION OUR STATE WHAT ALSO A SIGN TO THREE. FACILITIES TO EACH ONE OUR SERVER. THEY HAVE TO HELP. SHIFT EVERY SINGLE YEAR. SB WHEN WE- TO CHECK DALY PART OF QUALITY SAFETY OVER GROUP THE BE ABLE TO TRAIN STAFF IF TO BE ON SITE EVERY WEEK AND WE BELIEVE THAT THAT PRESENCE WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE BECAUSE ALREADY IN THIS PANDEMIC WE HAVE BEEN MORE ON SITE THAN WE EVER HAVE BEFORE IN HERE ALREADY NOTICING A BIG DIFFERENCE IN THE B. P. PLACES THAT WERE GOING AS WELL AS WERE NOTICING A DIFFERENCE THE ABILITY TO- MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF DEATH IN CASE IT. UP THE FIFTH ONE IS QUALITY AND SAFETY OVERSIGHT ACT. SO THIS IS THE STATE WHERE ALL STATES ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN DOING MOST OF THE LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION. BY PAPER AND MANUAL PROCESSES IT'S TWENTY TWENTY WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE REAL TIME DATA AS WELL AS- BE ABLE TO HAVE FACILITIES AND TRANSPARENCY TO BE ABLE EVERYONE TO BE ABLE TO SEE WHAT WERE SEEN. WHAT RECITING. WHAT THE PLANS ARE CORRECTION ARE AND ONCE WE HAVE THIS MOBILE APP WHERE TO A PORTAL SYSTEM CLOUD BASED SYSTEM THAT WE BE ABLE TO THAT. IMMEDIATELY POST THE RESULTS THE FACILITY WOULD BE ABLE TO IMMEDIATELY ENTER THEIR PLANS A CORRECTION. ALL OF THAT WOULD BE TRANSPARENT FOR OUR STAKEHOLDERS AS WELL. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS. LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION ACROSS THE NATION TENDS TO BE A VERY REACTIVE TYPE OF WORK. YOU GO AND ONCE A YEAR ON A SCHEDULE. YOU GO IN WHEN THERE IS A REACTION TO EITHER CMPLAINTS. OR INCIDENT. AND WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS CREATE MORE OF A PROACTIVE APPROACH AND SO WHAT WE STARTED TO DO IN THESE LAST COUPLE OF. MONTHS IT STARTED TO GATHER DATA. NOT ONLY DATA FROM. HIM COMPLAINTS HISTORY IN THE PAST. BUT ALSO. SELECTING DATA FROM THE DAILY REPORTING THAT WE'RE REQUIRING ALL OF THE FACILITIES TO PROVIDE AT. WE TAKE ALL THAT DATA AND COME UP WITH THE HIGH RISK LIST EVERY DAY. IF YOU'RE A FACILITY AND UP ON THE HIGH RISK LIST THEY GET AN IMMEDIATE PHONE CALL REACH OUT AND THEN WE ALSO GO ON SITE. THAT WEEK TO BE ABLE. TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON. AND SO TRYING TO LOOKING. INDICATORS AND A ESTABLISHED KIND OF A PROJECT OF. I THINK IT. MAY BE. WITH STAFF SHE- WHERE MIGHT BE A- SECTION CONTROL ISSUES THAT'S ALLOWING US TO BE WAY MORE PROACTIVE THAN ANY OTHER STATE AND SO ALL OF THIS IS BRAND NEW. IT'S DEFINITELY LEANING FORWARD. AND SO FAR WHAT I WAS HAPPY TO SEE IT AS WE STARTED TO- ROLL OUT SOME OF THESE INITIATIVES AND SOME OF THESE OTHER INITIATIVES OLD ROLL OUT THIS SUMMER AND FALL. OF WE WERE HAPPY TO SEE THAT AT LEAST TO SEE A MASK THE CMS DATA CAME OUT LAST WEEK. SHOWED THAT. DESPITE THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA HAS. MORE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AS WELL AS SKILLED NURSING SKILLED NURSING FACILITY RESIDENTS. WE HAVE TWELVE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR. HOWEVER WE ARE TWENTY THIRD IN THE AVERAGE DEATH RATE AND WE ARE BY FAR. LOWER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE AVERAGE IN EVERY KEY INDICATOR. WHETHER THAT'S CASES BUT THAT THAT STAFF. BUT THE STAFF RESIDENTS WE ARE BY FAR LOWER THAN ANY OTHER STATE. AND I THINK THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING ON SITE BECAUSE THE OTHER SET OF DATA THAT CMS RELEASED LAST WEEK. WITH THE AMOUNT OF TIME. THAT SURVEYORS HAVE PHYSICALLY BEEN ON SITE. AND YOU CAN SEE A DIRECT CORRELATION. BETWEEN CALIFORNIA WOULD BEEN ON SITE TO OLDER FACILITIES. EXCEPT FOR A FEW WHICH WE ARE ACTUALLY FINISHING UP THIS MONTH. BUT ALL OF THOSE FACILITIES DIRECTLY CORRELATES TO READ THEN YOU SEE THE CASES BY DEATH RATE. AND THEN YOU LOOK AT OTHER STATES THAT WERE ON THEIR 30% OF THE TIME 20% OF THE TIME AND YOUR SEEN A HUGE HUGE IMPACT. IN IN THEIR DEATH RIGHT AND SO WE DID. THAT ISSUES ME TO PLEASE YES I ARE NOW ALMOST AT TEN MINUTES WE HAVE FIVE MORE PANELISTS AND I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING YOU'RE SAYING BUT WE REALLY WANT TO HAVE A DISCUSSION SO IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND WOULD YOU PLEASE WRAP UP. WE CAN'T HAVE ALL RIGHT PANELISTS GO TEN MINUTES THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK FOR SO. SORRY MY APOLOGIES. NOW THAT'S FINE I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT THERE'S A CORRELATION WE SEE THAT THERE'S AN- ADD. WELCOME THAT CHANGE. AND I WANT TO BE. THIS CONVERSATION SO I APPRECIATE THAT YOU YOU PUT TOGETHER ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TODAY. SO THAT WE CAN BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS TOGETHER. THANK YOU IT WILL BE HARD TO CUT HAVE A CONVERSATION IF EVERYBODY DOES A TEN MINUTE- PRESENTATION HERE SO. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION- WILL MOVE ON NEXT TO OUR NEXT PANELIST CAME ACCORDING. GOOD MORNING. AND THANK YOU TO THE ASSEMBLY FOR FOCUSING TODAY ON CALIFORNIANS WHO LIVE IN SKILLED NURSING THEIR FRIENDS AND FAMILY WHO LOVE THEM. AND THE STAFF WHO WORK THERE. AND THANK YOU FOR INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF AGING- THIS IS A VERY VERY TOUGH TIME. FOR THE PHYSICAL HEALTH AND THE MENTAL HEALTH OF ALL RESIDENTS OF SENIOR LIVING AND WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY AND I WILL BE BRIEF. CDA HAS THREE ROLES AS REGARDS PEOPLE IN SENIOR LIVING FIRST WE HOUSE THE OFFICE OF LONG TERM CARE. LET'S WHICH IT DEPENDED ADVOCATE FOR. BY PUBLIC INFORMATION TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY AROUND AGING AND DISABILITY. AND HAVE TRIED VERY HARD TO KEEP FAMILY AND FRIENDS INFORMED. AND THIRD REALLY THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING WHICH IS HELPING CHART THE WAY FORWARD. IF WE- ALL STRATEGIES FIRST FOR THE AMBIANCE AS- A BELIEVE ASSEMBLY WELL KNOWS THE OFFICE HAS BEEN BANNED FROM ALL FACILITIES SINCE MARCH THIRTEENTH NATIONWIDE DUE TO INFECTION CONTROL. THIS HAS MEANT TO PEOPLE THAT TO WORK DOUBLE TIME TO CONNECT OVER TELEPHONE AND INTERNET AND OTHER WAYS TO TRY TO GET. COMPLAINTS AND QUESTIONS OF CALLS ANSWERED. ARE THE TOP LINE KNOW HOWEVER IS THAT WITH A 43% DECLINE IN ABUSE CALLS COMING IN. WHICH ARE DOES RAISE QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS AND WE ARE WORKING DOUBLE TIME WITH THE V. P. H. TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN STRENGTHEN THOSE CONNECTIONS AND GET. INTO FACILITIES AS SOON AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE BUT IN THE MEANTIME MAKES YOUR TELEPHONE AND INTERNET IS WORKING FOR US. SECOND WE HAVE TRIED TO ENGAGE THE PUBLIC THERE'S MORE INFORMATION ON OUR ENGAGE CA DOT ORG SITE. FAQS IN ENGLISH SPANISH MANFORD WE'VE HAD CONFERENCE CALLS WITH FAMILIES AND FRIENDS ABOUT CARE GIVING FROM AFAR ABOUT ADVANCE CARE PLANNING. ABOUT GRIEF AND LOSS. WE HAVE. EXPANDED STATEWIDE THE FRIENDSHIP LINE SO THAT ANYONE SENIOR LIVING AT HOME CAN CALL AND TALK IF YOU'RE LONELY. AND ISOLATED WE ARE WELL AWARE OF THE DESPAIR. IMPACTING TOO MANY PEOPLE I FEATURED IN A WONDERFUL ARTICLE BY DOCTOR LOUISE ERRANT'S AND THE NEW YORK TIMES YESTERDAY. I HOPE THAT FRENCH WINE TO BE ONE SMALL PART OF ADDRESSING THE DESPAIR. AND WE'RE WORKING ON DIGITAL DIVIDE STRATEGIES TO HELP OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WHO LOVE THEM STAY ONLINE GET ONLINE GO MORE ALONG. FROM HER. WITH NEW FUNDING AND PRIVATE PHILANTHROPY. APPROACH FIRST AND FOREMOST MASTER PLAN FOR EATING IS DRIVEN BY EQUITY. AND FORMED AN EQUITY WORKGROUP IN FEBRUARY IS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE RACIAL DISPARITIES THAT ARE SHOWING UP AND DEATHS. ALL ACROSS THE STATE INCLUDING SENIOR LIVING AND SOME EMERGING NEW RESEARCH ABOUT. OF THE COMPOSITION OF THE MIX OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING AT HOME AND THE CONNECTION TO RATES AND THERE'S A LOT TO DO THEIR TO UNDERSTAND AND ADDRESS THE DISPARITIES. AND AS YOU MAY WELL KNOW THE LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS SUBCOMMITTEE RELEASED THEIR REPORT THE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S ON MAY TWENTY EIGHTH. COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT ADDRESSING THE ENTIRE CONTINUUM OF CARE. REALLY UNDERSTAND HOMES TALKS ABOUT HE ISSUES SUCH AS THE WORK FORCE PUBLIC INFORMATION ON QUALITY STATE OVERSIGHT AND AGAIN STRONG ALTERNATIVES FOR HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES SO MORE OFTEN LIVE AT HOME IN THE HOMES OF OUR CHOOSE ONE TENTH OF OUR CHOICE LASTLY ARE YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THE ADMINISTRATION A PARTNERSHIP WITH US THE H. C. F. ANNOUNCED A NEW LONG TERM CARE AT HOME BENEFIT. WILL BE RECONVENING THE MASTER PLAN FOR LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS COMMITTEE SHORTLY TO BEGINNING GAUGING WITH THERE'S A POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVE OUGHT TO NURSING HOME AS PART OF THE OVERALL STRATEGY WITH THAT HOW COULD MY REMARKS AND LOOK FOR DISCUSSION PERFECT THANK YOU SO MUCH. MISTER CORNET. YES THANK YOU CHAIRMAN WOULD IN GERMAN IS THERE ANY MEMBERS MY NAME'S CRAIG CORNET ON THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH FACILITIES. I WANTED THE REASON I'M HERE TODAY IS TO AS AS THE PRESIDENT CEO OF THIS ASSOCIATION. IS TO EXPRESS TO YOU THE VERY VERY SIGNIFICANT. AND COULD CONCERN WE HAVE ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND HOW SERIOUSLY THE PROFESSION. TAKES OF IT NINETEEN AND HAS TAKEN THIS ISSUE. UP I WANT TO TELL YOU FROM THE BEGINNING RIGHT OFF THE TOP. THE MORE THE VICTIMS OF THIS PANDEMIC WE MORE THE RESIDENTS AND HAITIANS IN OUR FACILITIES WHO ARE PASSED FROM. NINETEEN WE MORE THE DEDICATED STAFF OF OUR FACILITIES. AND ALL OF THEIR FAMILIES. KOBE NINETEEN HAS BEEN DESTRUCTIVE IT HAS BEEN DESTRUCTIVE TO OUR RESIDENTS IT HAS BEEN DESTRUCTIVE. TO FAMILIES IT HAS BEEN DISTRACTED CHARACTER GIVERS ANTI THAT MINISTRY. THE ENEMY HERE HAS BEEN THIS VIRUS. NOT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THIS PROFESSION THE TWELVE HUNDRED- NURSING HOME FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT SERVER THAT SERVE ROUGHLY FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE YEAR WITH ALMOST A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. I WANTED TO GIVE YOU SIX POINTS THAT WE HAVE SEEN SO FAR. FIRST NUMBER ONE KOBE NINETEEN WAS NOTHING. NOTHING LIKE WE HAVE EVER SEEN IN TERMS OF THAT AND DAMMIT TERMS OF THE DISEASE- NOT JUST IN NURSING HOMES BUT ANYWHERE WORLDWIDE. NUMBER TWO. THE INFORMATION AND WHAT WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT THIS VIRUS CHANGED IT CHANGED A LOT IT CHANGED FREQUENTLY. JUST FOR EXAMPLE AT THE VERY BEGINNING- THERE WAS NOT THERE'S REALLY NOT CLEAR THAT A SYMPTOMATIC PEOPLE POLLUTING OUR RESIDENTS ARE VISITORS ARE CARE GIVERS. WHEN THEY WERE A SYMPTOMATIC THAT THEY COULD HAVE THE VIRUS AND COULD BE SPREADING IT WITHOUT SHOWING ANY SIGNS. THIS IS A. DEVASTATING THANK BEAT B. S. OF OPERATE. NUMBER THREE IT WAS ESSENTIALLY AT A LATEST ON THE IN A AND NOW ALSO ALL TOGETHER BY THE TIME EVERYONE ANYONE KNEW WHAT THE GOING ON IT HAD A SPREAD MANY OF THE AND MANY PARTS OF THE A CAL AND IN ORDER HOME BEFORE WE EVEN REALLY KNEW WAS GOING. NUMBER AND THIS ONE I CANNOT EMPHASIZE ENOUGH. ONE OF THE WE HAVE HAD THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE HAD SO FOR THAT'S FOR. IS THE WE HAD AN ATTIC. PERSONAL PER EQUIPMENT RPP. FOR MONTHS. SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE SHORT ON SUPPLIES. AND THOSE SUPPLIES MASK CLUBS DOWN SHE- THERE WERE AS TO. THE SPREAD OF THE DISEASE. NUMBER FIVE AND THIS ONE I THINK ALSO CANNOT EMPHASIZE ENOUGH. UNTIL FAIRLY RECENTLY THERE HAS BEEN TOTALLY INADEQUATE TEST. THIS WAS A GARGANTUAN EFFORT AND A HERCULEAN EFFORT I THINK THAT THE STATE HAS HAD TO UNDERGO. TO BRING TESTING TESTING- UP. BUT AS IF YOU KNOW ANY. HEALTH KNOWING ASSEMBLY POPULAR AND IN WITH THE- IS CRITICAL TO BE ABLE TO ACT. AND NUMBER SIX THIS ONE POINT TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT AS WELL. SKILLED NURSING WERE REALLY NOT HAPPY. BEGINNING OF THIS PAN I THINK I THINK ANYONE WHO AT THIS STORE WILL. THAT AT IT JUST TO SAVE M. THAT'S WHERE NO CAST KNOWS BIRD I DON'T BELIEVE BECAUSE I THINK. THE ENTIRE SOCIETY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STATE GOVERNMENT LOCAL GOVERNMENT EVERYONE WAS MUCH MORE FOCUSED INITIALLY ON THE HOSPITAL'S KNOWING THAT WE MIGHT BE FORTY THOUSAND HOSPITAL BIT SHORT. SNIFFS WE'RE NOT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE LINE AND SO CONSEQUENCES THAT. BEING SECONDARY I THINK I HAVE HAD TO HAVE A DEVASTATING AFFECTS. UP IN ADDITION WE'VE HAD CONFLICTING STANDARDS AND GUIDANCE THAT HAS HAMPERED OUR EFFORTS AS I SAID THE GUIDANCE IS CHANGED FROM STATE AND FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OVER TIME. WE STILL HAVE CONFLICTING GUIDANCE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. WHAT THE WHAT THE COUNTIES ARE REQUIRING THREE NOW SOME CITIES ACTUALLY INVOLVED AS WELL IT IS CONFLICTING WITH WHAT THE STATE BACK SOMETIMES TELLS. SO THOSE ISSUES OUT WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE AND THIS IS A- VERY OF I THANK YOU DIRECT SOON. YES THANK THANK YOU UP I SAY THAT THERE ARE THREE FOUR THINGS THAT WE REALLY NEED RIGHT NOW.

MAJORITY OF MEDICAL DIRECTORS OF PERSONAL THROUGHOUT THE STATE UNDER SURE THE FINAL. WE FEATURE WITH YOUR FACILITY LEADERSHIP TEAM. NEGATIVE IMPACT OF THIS HAS BEEN AMPLIFIED BY COVERT NINETY.

THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH- OUR NEXT PANELIST PAT MCGINNIS. THANK CHAIRMAN WHAT THIS AREA TO MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY AT THIS IMPORTANT HEARING. I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA HAVE A FIX FOR NURSING HOME REFORM THE NONPROFIT ADVOCACY GROUP BASED IN SAN FRANCISCO AND SERVING LONG TERM CARE CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA. THIRTY SEVEN YEARS WITH ADVOCATING FOR ADEQUATE STAFFING IN NURSING BETTER CARE FOR RESIDENTS BETTER OVERSIGHT BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND PROTECTION OF RESIDENTS FROM THE COLLECTED DATA. I THINK THE FEE FOR A NUMBER OF OUR MATERIALS INCLUDING WHAT STEPS SHOULD BE TAKEN IF WE WANT TO CHANGE THE COURSE. OF CARE FOR NURSING HOME RESIDENTS AND SOME OF THE MATERIALS REGARDING THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS IN NURSING HOMES ARE EMERGENCY PLANS WHICH WE FIRST SENT TO THE DEPARTMENT EARLY APRIL. WHAT WORKS WITH NOT MUCH FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE DECLARATION OF A STATE OF EMERGENCY. I WE WERE WELL AWARE THAT NURSING HOMES WOULD BE THE PERFECT INCUBATORS FOR THE VIRUS. AND THAT NOTHING WAS DONE MANY RESIDENTS AND STAFF WOULD BECOME THE SECOND INFECTED WOULD DIE. NOW TWO THOUSAND PLUS AND IT'S RISING EVERY DAY- THOUSANDS OF NURSING HOME STAFF TODAY WE NOTED SIXTY EIGHT NURSING HOME STAFF HAVE DIED. AND THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT WHILE OF THESE DEATHS WERE NEVER. MANY OF THEM IN THE IN. WERE PREVENTIVE. THEY DIRECT RESULT OF THE PER POLICIES THE INADEQUATE OVERSIGHT OF THE AGENCIES APPOINTED TO PROTECT NURSING HOME RESIDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. AND OF COURSE THE DIRECT RESULT OF THE IN DEPTH IN THE GLASS. OF CALIFORNIA'S NURSING YOUR- YOUR OF CALIFORNIA NURSING HER WERE AND- EVEN PRIOR THE CONDEMNED. THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC GRANTED STAFFING WEIGHBRIDGE. HUNDREDS OF NURSING HOMES THE FUTURE DELUDE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO MAKE A VERY MINIMAL STAFFING REQUIREMENTS. THEY CONTINUE TO HAVE A BACKLOG OF THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF COMPLEX. SO IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT THE NURSING HOMES WITH THE WORST RECORD TO CARE WITH PREVIOUS INFECTION CONTROL DEFICIENCIES. AT THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF DEATHS AND SUFFERING. OF THE 50% THE FISCAL AND NURSING HOMES HAD DEFICIENCIES AND AFFECTION CONTROL AND PREVENTION WITHIN THE PAST TWO YEARS. MOST THE PHILLIES DIDN'T HAVE A FULL TIME INFECTION CONTROL SPECIALIST IF THEY HAVE THEM AT ALL. AND FAILED TO TRAIN STAFF. CAROLINE CONVENTION. YOU DELETE THAT THE BISHOP PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT- IN IN TERMS OF SO THE STAFFER TOLD TO SHOW UP TO WORK TO RISK GETTING FIRED. THERE WAS NO TESTING IT ON THE FIRST COUPLE OF MONTHS AND EVEN OUT THREE PLUS MONTHS THIS CRISIS. CASTING A SPORADIC BINGE. ONE OF THE THIRD OFFICE BUILDINGS OTHER OUT BY PARK WAS TO ALL. FOR NURSING. NO FAMILY NO AND UP. NO LONGER CARE AND BURKE AND BOTH MEN AND NO NURSE THE VALUATIONS BEGINNING. I DON'T THINK ANY VALUE WAIT REMOTELY AND YET THERE WERE NO LIMITS PLACED THE NURSING STAFF THE WALK TO WORK TWO JOBS JUST TO MAKE A LIVING WAGE- OF MISCONDUCT REFERRED TO THE- ARCHITECT INFECTION CONTROL SURVEYS AND ENGAGE THEY GET DO SOME OF THOSE INFECTION CONTROL SURVEYS- WE LOOKED OVER MANY UP. HUNDREDS OF THEM ONE OF THE TARGETED OBJECTION TO TRAVEL SURVEYS TOOK PLACE IN EARLY APRIL. THE BILL YOUR REHAB AND NURSING CENTER IN RIVERSIDE THEY RECEIVED A CLEAN SURVEY WITH NO INFECTION CONTROL DEFICIENCIES. LATER LIKE. THREE DAYS LATER. EIGHTY FOUR OF ITS RESIDENTS WERE EVACUATED DUE TO ANNOUNCE ABOUT BREAK IN EXTREME STAFFING CRISIS. IN YEAH THEIR INFECTION CONTROL SURVEY DATED APRIL SEVENTH DAY BUT NO YEAH A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH. FOUND THAT TIME AND TIME AGAIN FORTY. EIGHT TWENTY NINE STAFF OR EXPECTED IT AND MANY PATIENTS THAT. THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF SURVEYS WITH NOTIFICATION BECAUSE THE SURVEYOR ONE STRUCK DID NOT TO FIGHT UNTIL THESE BUT TO COLLABORATE WITH THEM. MEANWHILE THOUSANDS OF NURSING HOME RESIDENTS. SUFFERED AND DIED ALONE. A SIMPLE THAT'S THAT EVERYONE. CHILD IT'S JUST THE WARNING BEHAVIOR. YET WE CAN. TO REWARD NOT SURE THAT THE STATE. THE SUNSET SUNSET CHAIR AND- A FULL TWO BILLION A LOT ANGELES WITH THE- RECORD THAT AND CAL. AND MANY WERE. RESIDENT HAVE DONE OF CODE OR BECAUSE IN FACT. ARE NOW DOESN'T HOPE DESIGNATED FACILITIES MEANING THEY CANNOT RECEIVE SIX TO EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS A DAY OUR CO THE PATIENT. EITHER. ONE AND TWO STAR FACILITIES FOR THE MOST PART. A CRIME DOESN'T PAY. BECAUSE THE NEED TO FILL THESE WORDS IN. ONE GRAD PARKER. THREE SIX RESIDENTS SIDE OF THE CODE NINETEEN CAUSES NEARLY A HUNDRED RESIDENTS AND STAFF WERE AFFECTED AND THEY ARE NOW OPPOSED THE DESIGNATED NURSING HOMES THANK TO REAP THE BENEFITS OF INFECTING THEIR RESIDENTS AND STAFF. HOLLYWOOD PREMIER HEALTH CARE CENTER ANOTHER OF THE DEDICATED SO THAT NINETEEN YEAH. WE'RE NINETEEN RESIDENTS DIED FROM CO THE CAUSES AND ANOTHER NINETY RESIDENTS AND STAFF WERE INFECTED. OR NOT SENATE'S READ. THE WEBSITE IS NOT. DOING AN ALTERNATIVE BUSINESS MODELS BY BECOMING THE DESIGNATED FACILITY SO THE MORE PEOPLE YOU KILL THE MORE PEOPLE YOU GET INFECTED THE MORE MONEY YOU CAN GET PER PATIENT PER DAY. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL INTENDS TO REWARD THE NURSING HOME INDUSTRY ONCE AGAIN WITH BILLIONS MORE IN THAT ACCOUNT DOLLARS WITH NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY OF THOSE FUNDS WILL GO TO IMPROVE STAFF. STAFFING RATIOS INFECTION CONTROL OR QUALITY OF CARE. WHAT HAPPENED CALIFORNIA'S NURSING HOMES IS A TRAGEDY AND SOME NOT FROM WHAT PEOPLE AVOIDABLE IF OUR GOVERNMENT AGENCY HAD THE COURAGE TO BE A CONSUMER PROTECTION AGENCY INSTEAD OF A PROVIDER PROTECTION AGENCY. MEANWHILE FAMILY MEMBERS ARE PROHIBITED FROM VISITING THEIR MOTHERS AND FATHERS THEIR BROTHERS AND SISTERS THEY REMAIN WITHOUT ANY RIGHT. BUT HAVE NO VISITORS AND NO ONE TO ENSURE THEIR SAFETY SO WE OF BEAUTY SHOPS BARS. OPEN NURSING HOME RESIDENTS AGAIN EITHER ONE DOESN'T CAN. WE HAVE SAM'S TO. AN AND TO DIE ALONE AND- KITCHEN. WE HAVE AN OF RECOMMEND. FOR I JUST TO THE COMMITTEE. WE NEED TO KEEP RESIDENTS OUT OF NURSING AND WE HAVE TO FIND REAL. YOU MAY BASED. THANK YOU TO BAN SHARED ROOMS AND- THE IDEA THANK YOU NIGHT THE LATE ONE. THANK YOU WOULD LIKE TO CHAT IT THANK YOU VERY THEIR THANK SOME WE WHAT TO GO ON OF WELL PAST THE FOUR MINUTES BUT- WE APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY AND- I THINK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR PASSION AS WELL.I'D LIKE TO MOVE ON TO OUR OUR NEXT- ARE FOR THE NEXT AND FINAL PANELIST AT LISA COLEMAN. PLEASE GO AHEAD WHEN YOU'RE READY LISA. MORNING THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBERS FOR THIS OPPORTUNITYAND THESE DEPLOYMENT AND THE SECOND DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN ASSOCIATION. I WANT TO START BY SAYING I APPRECIATE THIS TIME TO HAVE A DISCUSSION AND WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL THAT WE'RE NOT VILIFYING THIS INDUSTRY. IT IS. NONE OF US HAVE THE ABILITY TO SAY WITH ANY CERTAINTY THAT WE WILL NOT ULTIMATELY END UP IN A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY OR SOMETHING THAT WE LOVE WILL NEED THIS KIND OF CARE AND SO REFERRING TO THESE FACILITIES AS DEATH TRAPS ARE GIVING THE IMPRESSION THAT LIFE IS JUST NOT WORTH LIVING IF IT'S GONNA BE LIVED IN A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY DOESN'T HELP THE NARRATIVE IN ANY WAY. IF ANYTHING IT COME IT COMPOUNDS THE GUILT AND THE ANXIETY THAT THE RESIDENTS EXPERIENCE AND THOSE WHO LOVE THEM SO WHAT I'M HERE TODAY TO SAY IS WE NEED TO BE FLOODING THESE FACILITIES WITH RESOURCES AS WELL AS HOLDING THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE PROBLEM FOR THAT FOR CARE THAT THEY ARE MANDATED TO PROVIDE. SO UNDER THE GUISE OF RESOURCES THE FOR ONE WE NEED TO GET THE OMBUDSMAN'S BACK IN THE BUILDING- I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT WE DO THIS **** NILLY I'M SUGGESTING THAT IS DONE THOUGHTFULLY AND WITH. A PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT APPROPRIATE. I CAN ASSURE YOU. EVERY LOCAL OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM IS INTIMATELY AWARE OF THE FACILITIES THAT STRUGGLE TO PROVIDE GOOD CARE PRIOR TO THE NINETEEN. AND IT IS THOSE FACILITIES THAT OUR GREATEST RISK THAT THE OMBUDSMAN'SARE ANXIOUS TO GET BACK IN AND LOOK BEHIND THE CURTAIN. THE SECOND RESOURCE. THE STATE NEEDS TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE. SHAMEFUL PRACTICE WITH VERY FEW EXCEPTIONS. OF PAYING CNA IS A POVERTY WAGE. YEAR AFTER YEAR WE HEAR THE INDUSTRY LIMIT THAT THEY CAN'T KEEP STAFF. AND RATHER THAN ADDRESSING THE ISSUE THE NEED TO PAY A PROFESSIONAL WAGE. FACILITY UNDER SEEK THE DEPARTMENT'S PERMISSION TO UTILIZE STAFF SHORTAGE WAIVERS. I WALKED CARE STAFF BY AND LARGE ARE VERY CARING DEDICATED INDIVIDUALS WE CAN'T BE SO NAIVE AS TO THINK THAT THEY'RE WORKING SIXTY TO EIGHTY HOURS A WEEK IN MULTIPLE FACILITIES BECAUSE THEY LOVE WHAT THEY DO. THEY WORK THESE KINDS OF OURS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S REQUIRED TO COVER THE RENT. EVEN DURING A PANDEMIC BOTH INDUSTRY AND DEPARTMENT LEADERS JUSTIFIED THE CONTINUING UTILIZATION OF CARE STAFF WORKING IN MULTIPLE FACILITIES. WITH SEEMINGLY NO REGARD TO THE FACT THAT CARE STAFF WITH NO MALICE INTENT ON THEIR PART. WE'RE SPREADING OF THE NINETEENTH FROM FACILTY TO FACILITY AND ACROSS COUNTY LINES. INDUSTRY DEPARTMENT LEADERS STATED PUBLICLY THEIR FEARS THAT IF FACILITIES DIDN'T YOU STAFF THAT WORKED IN MULTIPLE FACILITIES THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO COVER THEIR BE SHIPPED. AND WHILE TARGET AND SAFE WAY. FOUND A WAY TO PAY HAS A DIFFERENTIAL THIS INDUSTRY REFUSES TO LET THE GENIE OUT OF THE BOTTLE. AND I BELIEVE IT'S BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT IF THEY DID PAY A SALARY WORTHY OF THE HARD WORKING PROFESSIONAL JOB OF CARING. FOR ELDERLY AND FRAIL RESIDENTS THEY WOULD NO LONGER BE ABLE TO POINT TO THE HIGH TURNOVER OF STAFF. FOR MANY SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES IT'S MORE THAN 60% EVERY YEAR AS THE REASON WHY TAKE CARE WHY THEY'RE CHRONICALLY OPERATE SHORT STAFFED. AND WHY THEY CAN'T GET A HANDLE ON FACILITY COMPLIANCE ISSUES LIKE INFECTION PREVENTION CONTROL. I DO HAVE A PROPOSAL FOR THE LEGISLATURE. COUNTY HEALTH LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICES OF EMERGENCY SERVICES MAILBOX ALL OF THESE TEAMS NEED A LOCAL LONG TERM CARE EXPERT ON THEIR TEAM. IDEALLY AN OMBUDSMAN. THEY NEED THE PERSON ON THE TEAM. A PERSON THAT KNOWS THE CARE NEEDS OF LONG TERM CARE RESIDENTS AND IS CONSIDERED WHEN PLANTING REGIONAL PLANNING EFFORTS. NO ONE KNOWS CARE FACILITIES BETTER THAN THE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN. IT WAS ESPECIALLY FRUSTRATING FOR THESE ADVOCATES TO LEARN OF FACILITY OUTBREAKS VIA SOCIAL MEDIA OR ON THE LOCAL NEWS. AND WHILE IT IT DOESN'T MATTER NOW. THE VERY FIRST DATA IN A SKILLED AT IN A IT'S AN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY AND NOT SOUTH SACRAMENTO OCCURRED WALL OMBUDSMAN'S WERE STILL MAKING VISITS INTO THESE FACILITIES WITHOUT PP AND DISABILITY KNEW ABOUT IT AND THE LICENSING AGENCY KNEW ABOUT IT BUT THEY HAD NOT YET THAT INFORMATION WITH THE OMBUDSMAN. THIS INDUSTRY CAN DO BETTER. THE FIST THE RESIDENTS WHO LIVE IN THESE FACILITIES NEED US TO DO THAT AND THE LOCAL LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM STAND AS WORKING PARTNERS READY TO HELP IT BE BETTER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I'D LIKE TO THIS POINT. TURN OVER TWO OF THE MEMBERS FOR QUESTIONS AND I WANT TO SAY I WANNA LET THE QUESTIONS GO TO ABOUT TEN TWENTY FIVE AND THEN WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS I'D LIKE TO ASK OUR LAST THREE PANELISTS TO PREPARE A QUESTION FOR. OUR STATE REGULATORS OR- THE FACILITIES- TO ASK FOR YOU TO ASK THEM DIRECTLY A QUESTION PUBLICLY- THAT YOU MIGHT LIKE TO HAVE ANSWERED AND WE WILL. CONTINUE IN THAT VEIN UNTIL TEN FORTY FIVE- WE HAVE WILL TAKE PART COMMON NOT SAY AGAIN THAT OUR PUBLIC COMMENT WILL BE LIMITED FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT BUT WE WILL BE WE HAVE A HARD STOP AT ELEVEN AM. AND ANY OTHER PUT A PUBLIC COMMENT WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO RECEIVE IN WRITING AND I PROMISE YOU THAT WE WILL- WE WILL READ IT AND WE WILL RESPOND SO AT THIS POINT LIKE TO OPEN AND TO MEMBERS WHO WHO HAVE QUESTIONS. ALSO LIKE TO WELCOME. WITH ROOM THE RACE HERE THE CHAIR OF OUR HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE. MISTER RAMOS- ALSO UNDER BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON HEALTH COMMITTEE TASHA BOERNER HORVATH. ARE YOU AN HAVE HUMAN SERVICES ON LONG TERM CARE THANK YOU AND THEN MR LACKEY AS WELL- LONG TERM CARE THANK YOU. SO QUESTIONS AND MISTER A DOCTOR RAMYA EXCUSE ME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- IF I MAY I FIRST WANT TO START WITH THE HEIDI STAN OCCURRED DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH JUST SO SHE CAN COME TO THE MICROPHONE. BUT I WANTED TO TALK IF I COULD BECAUSE I'VE BEEN QUITE IMPRESSED HAS YOU'VE SPOKEN ABOUT YOUR SIX STRATEGIES TO HELP IN THIS AREA. AND WANTED TO SPEAK DIRECTLY IF I COULD ABOUT THE ANALYTICS YOUR FINAL POINT THAT YOU SPOKE ABOUT HOW WE CAN BE MORE PROACTIVE VERSUS REACTIVE. AND WANTED TO ASK YOU DIRECTLY IF WE AS A STATE ARE LOOKING TOWARDS SOME OF THE BENCHMARKS THAT WERE SETTING UP FOR COUNTIES. AS WERE TRANSITIONING INTO PHASES AND WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE LOOKING AT THOSE BENCHMARKS AS AREAS IN WHICH WHERE WE CAN DIRECTOR STRIKE TEAMS. SO SPECIFICALLY. COUNTIES THAT ARE STARTING TO EXPERIENCE GREATER THAN 8% POSITIVE. RATES WITHIN. THERE ARE COUNTIES ARE WE DIRECTING STRIKE TEAMS TO THOSE COUNTIES AND THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. DUE TO THOSE HIGHER THAN. NORMAL ELEVATED RATES. GREAT QUESTION THANK YOU FOR THAT NO WE DO HAVE A COUNTING WATCH REPORT THAT COMES OUT EVERY NIGHT- SO WE HAVE THAT COUNTY WATCH REPORT WE SEND THAT OUT TO ALL OF OUR DISTRICT OFFICES IN OUR SURVEYOR SO THAT THEY'RE AWARE- IN ADDITION IN THE MORNING ANYTHING THAT SHOWS ON THAT HIGH RISK LIST WHETHER THAT IS IN ONE OF THOSE OF. THOSE HIGH RISK COUNTIES OF THOSE COUNTIES THAT ARE OPENING UP OR IF IT'S JUST A FACILITY AS- YOU KNOW I BELIEVE PATH TO GET AS HAD SAID THAT YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME FACILITIES THAT WE ARE WE'RE DEFINITELY WATCHING BECAUSE OF THAT PAST COMPLAINTS HISTORY SO BOTH CASES WHETHER IT'S ON THE COUNTY WATCH REPORT OR IF IT'S ON THE- PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS LIST. THE HIGH RISK LIST THAT WE GO AND- WE CONTACT THEM UP THAT NEXT DAY. I WOULD ASK IF I COULD HAVE SOME FOLLOW UP AS PRESIDENT COUNTY IS ONE OF THOSE COUNTIES THAT HAS RECENTLY GONE ABOVE 8% POSITIVE- TEST. PERCENTAGE AS WELL AS TULARE COUNTY WHICH IS IN THE CENTRAL BANK. MY NEXT QUESTION IS FOR CHEMICAL A WAY TO AND- YOU KNOW I WANT JUST TO START A FIGHT COULD WELL YOU'RE COMING TO THE MICROPHONE TO SAY THAT JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE A DECREASE IN TELEPHONE COMPLAINTS. DOES NOT MEAN THERE'S OT A NEED FOR US TO HAVE THE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY. TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S NOT. ABUSE OR NEGLECT OCCURRING WITHIN OUR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. AND SO THANK THAT. WE DO NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE RECTIFY THE- SITUATION WITH LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. AS THEY- HAVE BEEN OUR REPRESENTATIVES AND ADVOCATES WITHIN THESE FACILITIES AND- BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE THE EYES AND EARS THAT ARE NEEDED IN THIS MOMENTS TO ENSURE THAT- WE HAVE THAT. TRANSPARENCY THAT I WANTED TO ASK YOU IF I COULD NOW. SINCE YOU MENTIONED THE LONG TERM CARE BENEFIT. WHAT DOES THE TRANSITION LOOK LIKE. WHAT WHAT WHAT ACTUALLY DOES COMMUNITY SERVICE LOOK LIKE IN YOUR MIND GOING FORWARD AND HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT ARE FRAIL AND ELDERLY WHO RELY UPON THE SEA BASS AND ASSESS PO. ARE TAKEN CARE DURING- THESE- POTENTIAL TIMES JUST TO MAKE ASK YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. THANK YOU AND ABSOLUTELY AGREE ABOUT THE LONG TERM CARE OFF OF THAT NEED TO GET BACK IN A MEANINGFUL WAY WORKABLE ALL THE CAMPUS WILL STICK. TO FIGURE OUT THE SAFE WAY TO DO THAT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO 100% AGREE ON LONG TERM CARE AT HOME YOU KNOW IF I WOULD TAKE A PAGE FROM THE MASTER PLAN LONG TERM. SERVICES AND SUPPORTS SUBCOMMITTEE FIRST YOU HAVE THAT VISION THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE WHO WANT TO STAY HOME CAN'T STAY HOME AND HAVE THAT CHOICE WITHOUT ANY IS VERSIONS ON THE NEEDS FOR SKILLED NURSING A PART OF A CONTINUUM OF CARE. THAT CALIFORNIA'S LONG HAD A VISION FOR SUPPORTING LIVING INVOLVED WHETHER THAT DISABILITIES UP PEOPLE ENOUGH FOSTER CARE WE'VE RECENTLY MOVED FROM GROUP HOMES TO INDIVIDUAL HOMES- WE BELIEVE IN HOME LIVING AND SO WE NEED A VISION ABOUT WE NEED A DATA DRIVEN. MEASURE RAPIDLY TOWARDS THAT GOAL AND. SERVICES EVERY. THAT THINGS LIKE YOUR- THAT DOES. THINGS LIKE DAY. AT THE TIME. IN HOME HOW. THAT DOES INCLUDE TRANCE. IN IN AND OUT OF SAID. AS MAYBE THE- AND OF COURSE THAT TO BE A FOR. BUT I GOT MEDICAL OR- THAT THE ONE BACK MAKERS FOR ALL THREE. SO HOW DO WE- THAT THE IS ONE OF THE GOALS OF THE MASK PLAN. I'M EXTREMELY SHORT TERM CHALLENGES WITH THE BUDGET PICTURE BUT THERE'S ALSO CREDIBLE MEDIUM TO LONG TERM OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT WHAT THE LONG TERM CARE HOME PROPOSAL WITH RBC OF PARTNERS- AS WELL AS ALL STAKEHOLDERS. I LAND AND PASS A BACK TO YOU YOU MISTER CHAIR BUT WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE LEASE A COLEMAN WHO HAS BEEN A LONGTIME ADVOCATE AND- WAS A WONDERFUL SPEAKER ON THIS PANEL. THINK SHE- IDENTIFIED AN ISSUE THAT MANY OF US FOR. YEARS HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WHICH IS A- LACK OF ADEQUATE WORK FORCE WITHIN THIS AREA. AND I THINK YOUR IDENTIFICATION OF HAZARD PAY IS SPOT ON AS WE ARE NOW ASKING THEM. NEARLY REQUIRE IT TO THEM. NEW SKILLS IN INFECTION CONTROL AND PROTOCOLS AND BELIEVE THAT AS WE ARE INCREASING THOSE SKILLS WE SHOULD ALSO BE INCREASING THEIR PAY. AS THAT WILL HELP US TO TAKE CARE OF OUR ELDERLY OUR MOST VULNERABLE IN THESE FACILITIES. IT'S BEEN LONG OVERDUE AND I THINK WE AS A STATE SHOULD LOOK TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS IN A PRODUCTIVE WAY. SO WE CAN MEET THE CHALLENGE OF THE MOMENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- WHAT WILL GO WITH THE BACK WITHOUT A MYSTERON AND THEN. MR READ- MISTER SALAS AND THEN MISS RATES. HELP THANK. YOU COULD PROTECT THE MIKE IN THE BACK THERE. WITH THE WITH THE WITNESS MIKE. I THINK IT'S ON. TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES AND WE'RE HARD WIRED HERE TOO SO. BUT TO TRY THE CRUNCHY TRY THE MIKE IN THE IN THE- BY THE BY THE BACK THERE. IT WASN'T. IT WASN'T PLUGGED IN OKAY. THAT'S A PROBLEM. OKAY. AND I'M LOOKING AT AS FAR AS- PREVENTIVE PREVENTIVE- LONG TERM HEALTH CARE WORKERS THOSE THAT ARE PROVIDING- HEALTH CARE TO ELDERLY IN THE HOMES AND THEN BEING ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE PART OF THE DISCUSSION MOVING FORWARD WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT PPVS- EARLY ON IN OUR HEALTH COMMITTEE IN OUR SUB ONE AND BUDGET IN GENERAL BUT WE WANNA- MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NURSING HOMES THAT WERE ALSO TALKING ABOUT THE PRE PRE ACTIVE- TO MAKING SURE THAT THOSE THAT ARE ACTUALLY CARING FOR PEOPLE IN THE HOMES RIGHT LONG TERM HEALTH CARE WORKERS THE HOME. ARE ALSO PART OF THE DISCUSSION AS FAR AS MAKING SURE THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PPVS WE TALK ABOUT ADEQUATE WAGES ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WERE BRINGING THE DISCUSSION INTO THE FOR FALL I UNDERSTAND NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE NURSING HOME BUT A LOT OF THAT COULD BE YOU KNOW IF WE'RE A TO A THE THINGS THAT PERHAPS IN THE- TERM. HEALTH CARE. MORE ONE OF THAT PART OF THE A AND DISCUSSED THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER RAMOS- MR SALAS. THANK YOU RICHARD FIVE TWO QUICK QUESTIONS I KNOW INITIALLY WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT THIS AND TRYING TO GET SOME NUMBERS OF THE NUMBERS WERE ACTUALLY REPORTED AS BEING- VOLUNTARY AND THEY WERE VOLUNTARILY COMING IN SO I WAS WONDERING FROM A STATE PERSPECTIVE HOW ARE WE MAKING SURE THAT THE INFORMATION IS ACCURATE. THIS IS MY FIRST QUESTION SECONDLY I KNOW MR AROUND ONE ALLUDED TO THIS AS WELL IN TERMS OF THE WORK FORCE WITH THE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU THAT. OUR GOAL THAT THAT WAS THE BIGGEST PLEA FROM THEM AS THEY WERE HAVING ISSUES WERE ADDITIONALLY WHEN WE WERE DEALING WITH COVERED BY T. WELL THEY DON'T WANT TO COME AND- WORK. SO WHAT WAS BEING DONE AT THAT ARE THEIR GUIDELINES ARE THERE. RESOURCES FROM THE STATE WHERE THEY SEND IN STRIKE TEAMS I THINK EVENTUALLY. WE DID GET A HOLD OF THE STATE THEY DID- HELP WITH SOME ASSISTANCE WITH THAT WASN'T UNTIL MUCH LATER. SOME TRYING TO FIGURE OUT FROM THE STATE'S PERSPECTIVE ARE WE DEVELOPING GUIDELINES NOW TO DO THIS TO MEET THESE NEEDS. ANTICIPATING THESE NEEDS BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN THIS- AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE STATISTICS I MEAN AT ONE IN EVERY FIVE. NURSING FACILITY AS SOME OF CORONAVIRUS INCIDENT. SO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE STATE'S PERSPECTIVE. FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S- PERSPECTIVE PLEASE. THAT QUESTION I BELIEVE YOU HAD MENTIONED THAT- YOUR LOVED ONE WAS IN IN KERN COUNTY AND I'M I'M VERY WELL AWARE OF. THE OUTBREAKS. WE'VE HAD A KERN INTO LARRY. AND IN THOSE CASES IN IN ESPECIALLY IN KERN COUNTY REMEMBER EARLY ON. WE WOULD SEND A TEAM WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS THERE BUT THEY ARE YOU KNOW SURVEYORS WHO WERE THERE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE OUR SITE. WE ALSO HAD OR H. I. TEAM THAT WERE THERE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE INFECTION. BUT THAT DOESN'T HELP WHEN THERE IS JUST NOT EVEN STAFF RIGHT AND SO I THINK THAT WAS THE CASE IN THOSE PARTICULAR FACILITIES THERE. YOU'RE JUST NEEDING BODIES THE STAFF THAT ARE TRAINED TO BE ABLE TO COME IN AND HELP AND DO. WORK SO WE HAVE USED A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT RESOURCES. REVIEWS HEALTH CORPS. WE HAVE USED- NATIONAL GUARD IN SOME CASES- AND IF YOU SOME STEP CONTRACT AGENCY. AND SO WE'RE BUILDING. WHAT STAFFING THOSE THROUGH THEIR CAPPING. THAT BLOCKED GOES TO THE STATE. OF WHERE WE'VE BEEN- OF THE WAY NEED AN UPDATE TO THE- OF A SENSE SOME OF THOSE OUT CAME ON IN AS WE START THE MANDATORY REPORTING- AND INITIALLY THAT MANDATORY REPORTING THIS IS BRAND NEW TO ALL TWELVE HUNDRED FACILITIES TO HALF REPORT EVERY SINGLE DAY SO INITIALLY WE WERE CALLING ALL FACILITIES AND GETTING DATA EVERY DAY. AND THEN WE SWITCH TO EIGHT APPS IN EIGHT AND A LINK THEY COULD BE ABLE TO REPORT EVERY DAY AND INITIALLY THAT RECORDING WAS FAIRLY- SPORADIC IN THE SENSE THAT IT OF. THERE WAS SOME LEARNING CURVE THERE FOR ALL OF THESE FACILITIES TO KNOW HOW TO USE IT. AS WELL AS- WITH THE NEW TECHNOLOGY OF COURSE MAKING SURE THAT IT ALSO REPORTED FOR DIFFERENT MODALITIES WHETHER SOMEONE REPORTED THROUGH THEIR PHONE WHETHER THEY REPORTED THROUGH ON THEIR DESKTOPS THAT TRACK. SO NOW WE ARE AVERAGING AROUND 93% OF OUR FACILITIES ARE REPORTING EACH DAY- WE DO FOLLOW UP WITH ANYONE WHO WAS A NON REPORTER ON THAT LIST FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE. THEY THEN GET A PHONE CALL THE VERY NEXT DAY AS WELL- AND WE HAVE DONE SOME CITATIONS- FOR THAT AS WELL AS WHEN WE PULLED ALL OF THE RECENT CMS DATA IN THREE MONTHS. WE CITED AT OVER THREE HUNDRED AND- FIFTY- FACILITY ISN'T DEAD AT A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT TYPES WAS INFECTION CONTROL CITATIONS. IMMEDIATE JEOPARDY SITUATION. AS WELL AS- SOME NON REPORTING SO- A VARIETY OF WHAT WERE SEEN THOUGH IS MUCH TO WHAT YOU'RE YOU'RE SPEAKING TO IS WE'RE WORKING WITH- WITH FOLKS WHO WHO REALLY NEED SOME SOME HELP WHEN IT COMES TO EDUCATION. ON INFECTION PREVENTION PREVENT THAT FEAR RIGHT THAT FEAR OF HOW. OFTEN AND COMFORTABLE USING THIS. I'M DOUBLE THE PUTTING THEMSELVES IN THEIR IN THEIR FAMILIES AT RISK WE. DID BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. I'M STOPPING THE STATE. AS WELL AS WE- ON FREE HOTELS. FOR HOW CARE WERE IF THEY WANTED TO GO TAKE A SHOWER DECONTAMINATE. TAKE A REST STAY AT HOME STAY THERE AT THE HOTEL BEFORE GOING TO THEIR FAMILY. THAT WAS ALL PROVIDED AS WELL FOR. FOR IT AT NO COST FOR THESE HEALTH CARE WORKERS WERE TRYING TO GET CREATIVE IN TRYING TO FIND AS MANY WAYS THAT WE CAN WRAP AROUND SERVICES. AROUND AND THE STAFF WERE WORKING SO HARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS RACE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. A DEAR FRIEND THE SAID TO ME. THAT IT IS AN UTTER TRAGEDY HOW OUR SENIORS HAVE BEEN TREATED IN NURSING HOMES AND THE DISRESPECT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO CARE FOR THEM I THINK I HEAR THIS FROM ALL OF ALL ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES THAT WE DO HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT. AT SOME POINT SOME OF US MAY END UP WITH THESE NURSING HOMES AND IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER RULES THEY ABIDE BY OUR RULES THAT WE PUT ON THEM NOW. BECAUSE IN THE END IT IS OUR PARENTS IT IS OUR GRANDPARENTS IT WILL EVENTUALLY BE US. WHO WILL BE- BENEFITING FROM THE VERY RULES WE PUT TOGETHER. I DO APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM MY- MY NEIGHBOR MY COLLEAGUE FROM. SANDRA DINO WE DO HAVE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THOSE WORKERS. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT I APPRECIATE LOSE A COLEMAN'S- COMMENTS THAT IT'S RESOURCES AND ACCOUNTABILITY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE RESOURCES. ONE OF ONE OF THE SPEAKERS TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT IF YOU HAVE THE IF YOU'RE THE ONE REASON RECEIVING THESE COVERT POSITIVE CO GOOD TO PATIENTS YOU RECEIVE EXTRA PAY. THE FACILITY DOES. THERE'S NOTHING TO TELL US THAT THE WORKERS WHO WORK WITH THOSE POSITIVE COVE IT- PATIENTS ARE RECEIVING THE ADDITIONAL PAY. SO SOMEBODY'S RECEIVING THE MONEY BUT IT'S NOT THE WORKERS. AND THERE'S HIGH TURNOVER RATE HAS TO BE OF GREAT CONCERN FOR US. BECAUSE IF THEY ARE NOT BEING PAID ENOUGH IN THERE NOW HAVING TO GO FROM FACILITY TO FACILITY. IN ORDER TO PAY THE RENT AS WAS MENTIONED. THEN WHAT CAN WE THE STATE DO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HELP THAT PROCESS. THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE PAY IF WE ARE NOT PAYING THEM ENOUGH AND BEGINNING AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SIMPLE TO DO YOU KNOW SAID. WHEN THEY ARE IN THE HOME BEFORE THEY EVER GO TO THE NURSING HOME NOW IT IN ONE OF THE DOCUMENTS ALSO THAT WAS PREPARED IT TALKS ABOUT PUTTING. THE HOME IN TURNER SING HOME. THIS BE A HOME MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE ARE ARE ARE PROTECTING THOSE SENIORS WHO ARE NOW BEING PUT IN THESE NURSING HOMES. IN THE SAME VEIN THEY ALSO SAY LET'S PUT NURSING BACK INTO A NURSING HOME LET'S TAKE CARE OF THOSE SENIORS THAT ARE IN THOSE FACILITIES. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE BEING TAKEN CARE OF AT A PARTICULAR STANDARD OF CARE. THE OTHER. ALL PROMISED THAT I WANTED TO MAKE WAS. THE RACIAL DISPARITIES I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS ON PAGE FOUR PAGE NINE OF OUR DOCUMENTS THEY DO TALK ABOUT THE RACIAL DISPARITIES THE AFRICAN AMERICAN LATINOS IN THE HAWAIIAN PACIFIC ISLANDERS. BUT AFRICAN AMERICAN SPECIFICALLY ACCORDING TO THE DOCUMENT THAT WAS PROVIDED. IS THE PROPORTION OF KOBE HAD NINETEEN DEATHS IN AFRICAN AMERICANS IS APPROXIMATELY DOUBLE THE POPULATION REPRESENTATION ACROSS ALL AGE CATEGORIES. WE READ IT. WE SEE IT TALK ABOUT IT WE REALLY HAVE TO HAVE A PLAN. THE NUMBERS ARE GIVEN REGARDING LATINOS BUT WE KNOW THAT THE NUMBERS ARE SIMILAR. THERE THE AFFECT ON THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE HEALTH CARE THOSE WHO ARE LIVING IN POVERTY WHO THEN HAVE TO USE THE SERVICES. THEY ARE BEING AFFECTED DISPROPORTION THOSE WHO LIVE IN THE VERY COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY THEY DEVELOP ASTHMA COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM BAKERSFIELD AND MANY OF THE REST OF YOU. IF THEY'RE HEALTH IS BEING COMPROMISED NOW IT BELOW POVERTY LEVEL THEY'RE NOT PART OF ONE OF THE RACIAL GROUPS THERE IS BEING DISPROPORTIONATELY. AFFECTED BY COULD NINETEEN NINETY IS JUST ONE OF MANY HELP HELP IT AFFECTS. WE HAVE TO HAVE A PLAN AND I APPRECIATE THAT I SIT IN THIS HOUSE WITH SOME VERY COMMITTED VERY COMMITTED TO MEMBERS AND I THAT'S WHAT I APPRECIATE ABOUT BEING HERE IS THAT I KNOW THAT WE WILL LOOK TO SOMETHING THAT WILL HELP US IN THE FUTURE. SO MOSTLY I WANTED TO MAKE THE COMMENTS AND I WANTED TO SAY HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS RACE ALSO ONE AND JUST NOTE WE HAVE OTHER MEMBERS HAVE A RISE MISTER OVER MISTER VOEPEL- MISSILE MON- CHAIR TEEN. OUR BUDGET COMMITTEE CHAIR- WOULD IN ANY OF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT TO ASK. COOPER COMMENTS THIS POINT OKAY. OKAY WILL BRING IT BACK. MR IS AREA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. QUITE A FEW QUESTIONS- I APPRECIATE THAT SEC SEVERAL OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY BROUGHT UP THE 10% INCREASE AND I. THE TEMPORARY 10% RATE INCREASE- TO COVER COVERT NINETEEN RELATED EXPENSES AND I'M INTERESTED TO KNOW IF THE STATE. OVER SAW HOW THESE WERE EXPANDED MY COLLEAGUE JUST RAISE THE ISSUE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THAT WENT TOWARDS- THE SALARIES SO WAS THERE ANY MATRIX DID WE KEEP TABS DID WE TRY TO BE BETTER INFORMED ABOUT HOW DOES. THAT WERE BEING EXTENDED- OF. IF. IS THAT A CRICKETER RESPOND EIGHT APPRECIATED AND THEN I'D LIKE TO ALSO ASK A COUPLE OF OTHER QUESTIONS ON GENERAL OVERSIGHT AND TESTING. AND WHILE MISS THAT OCCURS COMING TO THE MICROPHONE THE MEAT AND GO AHEAD AND ASK SOMETHING ELSE- ON OVERSIGHT. YOU STARTED TALKING ABOUT STRIKE TEAMS. SO AS WE LEARN MORE ABOUT THE STRIKE TEAMS GOING INTO THE AND GET GOING INTO SNIFFS TO ASSIST WITH INFECTION PROTOCOLS WHAT IS THE TIMELINE TO KEEP OVERSIGHT AND CONTINUE TRAINING. BOARD. I AM HERE NOW THANK YOU. OF YOUR OF YOUR FIRST QUESTION ABOUT THE MONEY IS THAT THE RATE INCREASES THAT IS THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES SO I CAN'T REALLY SPEAK TO SO MUCH- SPECIFICITY AS FAR AS THE ACS AND THE FACILITIES BUT I DO BELIEVE THE CRAIG- CAPITAL. I CREDIT FROM CAP WANTED TO SPEAK ON THAT IF THAT'S OKAY BEFORE I ANSWER YOUR QUESTION OR HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO PROCEED. WELL SINCE YOU'RE HERE WHY DON'T YOU ANSWER THE SECOND QUESTION THEM. OKAY OKAY SO I'LL ANSWER THE QUESTION ABOUT STRIKE TEAM SO. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION WITH THIS RIGHT TEAMS IS THAT WHEN WE GO AND WE OFTEN IN THE CASE THAT WAS- USES AN EXAMPLE LIKE MAGNOLIA. RIGHT HAVE BEEN THERE ON THE SEVENTH TO DO AN INFECTION CONTROL INSPECTION. EVERYTHING MIGHT HAVE LOOKED- FAIRLY OKAY WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO SOME TRAINING EXCEPT TRY. AND THEN THINGS CAN CHANGE IN THE FACILITY VERY VERY QUICKLY. WHICH IS WHY IN MAY BE STARTED TO GO TO MORE PROTECTIVE ANALYTIC MODEL. BECAUSE GOING INTO A FACILITY IN TRAINING BUT WHEN IT IS SEEN IN SOME OF THESE PLACES WE'RE GOING BACK REPEAT REPEAT REPEAT AND WHAT WE REPEAT AGO BACK. WE'RE SEEING THIS IT IS THE SAME THING BUT WITH A DIFFERENT SET OF STAFF BECAUSE OF THE HIGH STAFF TURNOVER. OR SOMETIMES JUST A GENERAL LACK LEADERSHIP- IN A LACK OF JUST HAVING AN INFECTION PREVENTION OVER BY. WHICH IS WHY. WE DECIDED TO THEN IN. EARLY MAY ISSUE OUT OF FELT REQUIRING THAT ONE HAS A CLUE BUT NINE IN MITIGATION PLAN. WHICH INCLUDES THAT THEY MUST HAVE A FULL TIME IT PRESENT. BECAUSE JUST LIKE WHAT YOU WERE SPEAKING TO WE MIGHT BE THERE BUT THE NEED LEAVE. AND THAT THINGS START TO TERRY IT AGAIN I WE WERE NOTICING THAT PATTERN AND TRYING TO STOP THAT PATTERN IS. POSSIBLE AS THIS ASK THIS AND IS BUILT ON. ARE YOU. CON CHANGE. TO BE ABLE TO CORRECT THAT IT'S MORE ACTIVE. BECAUSE OF THIS AREA. SO TO KNOW ABOUT THESE THE WE'VE KNOWN OF A LOT OF THESE THE FISH AND THIS IS AS ONE OF MY ALSO MEANT RIGHT NOW THIS VIRUS IT COULD HAVE BEEN ANY OTHER CIRCA ANY FIRE JUST BIG. AND BROUGHT LIGHT A OF THE DEFICIENCIES THAT WE'VE HAD BUT AS YOUR NOW GAINING INSIGHT INTO WHATEVER'S HAPPENING EMPLOYEES ARE NOT COMING TO WORK WELL EMPLOYEES ARE NOT GOING TO COME TO WORK IF THEY FEEL THERE'S SOMETHING TO BE TO BE RISKING RISKS IF THEY'RE ALSO NOT BEING COMPENSATED SO YEP WHAT WERE SOME AS WHAT WE'RE STE THE STEPS TAKEN BY THE AGENCY TO MAINTAIN OVERSIGHT SO THAT WEEK THIRD OF DEMAND FORM WE CAN ASK FOR MORE WE CAN ASK FOR HIGHER STANDARD WITH SITE. SINCE BEING PUT INTO PLACE BE EITHER GIVEN OUT WAR OR REPRIMANDS BEING GIVEN OUT AND STAND THIS WAS ONLY OVER THREE MONTHS YOU DO WE DO HAVE INSIDE IT'S NOT AS IF WE'RE STARTING FROM SCRATCH. NO ABSOLUTELY SO IN JUST THOSE THREE MONTHS WHEN I PULLED THE CMS DATA WEHAD GIVEN OUT OVER THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY CITATIONS. TO OVER A HUNDRED AND SIXTY DIFFERENT FACILITIES AND ALL OF THOSE A HUNDRED AND I THINK THIRTEEN OF THEM IT JUST THAT WHEN I PULL THE DATA FROM MARCH FIRST TO JUNE FIRST. THOSE WERE ALL INFECTION CONTROL SO HUNDRED THIRTEEN OF A MORE INFECTION CONTROL LOAN- SO THAT WAS- AND THAT WAS THE WAY THEY WERE WE'RE CONTINUING TO PROVIDE THAT THAT SITE THAT OVERSIGHT THEY HAVE TO WHATEVER WE DO A CITATION THEY HAVE TO THAN TO SUBMIT A PLAN OF CORRECTION. WE THEN ALSO THEN GO BACK INTO THE FACILITY TO CONFIRM THAT THEY DID FIX OUR PLANET CORRECTION. I'M AND SOME PLACES RECEIVED MULTIPLE- CITATIONS BECAUSE WHEN WE KEPT GOING BACK IN AND WE FOUND MORE ISSUES. THE OTHER THING THAT WE'VE NOTICES THE TREND IS- RECENTLY IS WE MIGHT GO INTO A FACILITY THERE MIGHT BE AN INFECTION PREVENTION ISSUE. AT FIRST. WE FIX THAT BY WORKING WITH THEM TO GIVE A TRAINING WE GIVE THEM EDUCATION. BUT WHEN WE ARE STAYING THERE LONG ENOUGH THEN. TO SEE QUALITY OF CARE ISSUES THAT ARE MORE DAMAGING. AND SO THIS QUALITY OF CARE ISSUES THAT THOSE END UP BEING. OF IT'S WHERE IN AN ACT WE ARE WORKING ON A CLOSURE OF THE FACILITY THIS WEEK BECAUSE OF THE QUALITY OF CARE THAT FOUND THERE. WE WERE. SO. I AGREE THIS UP. FORWARD EVEN HOST PANDA WE DON'T WANT TO BACK TO THE RIGHT SEE MON WHERE YOU ALL GO IN A YEAR THAT'S AT YES WE WILL CONTINUE DO THE CMS PATIENTS ONCE A YEAR YOU WANT TO ADD AN AUGMENT THOUGHT WITH THE STATE PROCESS THAT'S MORE ROBUST AND MORE ON IT AND MORE SIMILAR TO WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW. WHICH IS BEING ON SITE. SO IN ORDER TO KEEP WITH I AM THANK YOU I APPRECIATE IT I WANT TO TURN OVER SO THAT MISTER WHAT DOCTOR WOULD CAN. ASK SOME OF HIS QUESTIONS BUT I THINK SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I'M GOING TO BE VERY INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT AND- CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUES HERE AS WELL AS WITH DOCTOR WOULD. IS JUST SOME OF. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT AS A BUSINESS YOU PUT INTO PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU'RE PROTECTING THE STANDARD THAT YOU'RE PROVIDING ANY COULD BE IN ANY BUSINESS- OR OR- OR OR OR- THE CARE FOR THE INDIVIDUALS THAT YOU'VE TAKEN RESPONSIBILITY ON- AND I'M NOT JUST BLAMING THE SNIFFS HERE- SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. IT'S ALSO OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT. OVERSIGHT TO HAVE TAKEN TO PARTICIPATE IN AN EFFECTIVE WAY. HAVE SET CERTAIN STANDARDS. I'M I'M STILL BAFFLED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TESTING. AND ABOUT CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE. WHEN WE KNEW EARLY ON IN OCTOBER WHEN WE SHUT DOWN THE FACILITIES FROM FAMILY AND LOVED ONES GOING IN. WE KNEW THAT WE WERE CREATING A SAFE SPACE WELL IN THAT SAFE SPACE COME CERTAIN STANDARDS TO MAKE SURE THAT EMPLOYEES WHO ARE COMING IN AND OUT. DO NOT TAKE WHAT DO NOT MIGRATE OR EXPOSE BRING IN EXPOSURE. AND THE- WHEN YOU SEE THE BALLOONING OF DEATHS IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. OF A I CAN ONLY LOOK TO WHERE WE FAILED AS GOVERNMENT TO MAKE SURE WE PUT. AND IMPOSE CERTAIN STANDARDS- AS WELL AS- AS WELL AS THE CENTERS NOT BEING AS CAUTIOUS AS NEEDED. TO MAKE SURE THAT NOTHING WAS COMING INTO THE FACILITIES. AND THESE ARE GOING TO BE CONVERSATIONS THAT I'M GONNA WANT TO CONTINUE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THE WITNESS THERE THIS THIS IS THAT RIGHT FROM THE FROM CAP I FELT PRETTY SUFFICIENT OF HEALTH FACILITIES IF I COULD JUST ADD ON TO YOUR EARLIER QUESTION. ABOUT THE 10% ADD ON I JUST WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT. A COUPLE OF THINGS UP THAT THAT TEMPORARY 10% RIGHT NOW FACILITIES MANY MANY MANY FACILITIES INCLUDING SOME I JUST HEARD FROM A FOR THIS HEARING THIS MORNING. ACROSS THE STATE ARE PAYING HAVE TO PAY NOW. THAT THAT IS HAPPENING IN REAL TIME IT WAS A LEASE EVERYWHERE IN ADDITION THOUGH THAT TEMPORARY 10% IN ADDITION TO BEING USED FOR HAVING A- IT IS ALSO BEEN USED FOR OVER TIME. FOR ADDITIONAL- WITH WITH THE SPLIT STAFF HAVE NOT BEEN IN THE BUILDING UP BECAUSE THEY TESTED POSITIVE AND MAYBE OR MAYBE QUARANTINING AT HOME FOR A PERIOD- THERE ARE TEMPORARY WORKERS THAT HAVE TO BE BROUGHT IN FREQUENTLY. IN ORDER TO HAVE. IT FACILITIES ALSO HAVE HEY A PREMIUM. TO FOR. A P. IT HAD A IN SOME CASES BEEN VERY GAPS TO TERMS OF THE COST OF THE PP. SO THAT'S WHERE ALL THAT THAT'S WHERE THAT THAT'S FOR THIS FUNDS ARE GOING BUT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT. THAT THAT MORE RESOURCES ARE GOING INTO STAFF AND- COST ALL THE TIME- THAT THAT'S NECESSARY. THE AST THING THIS TO YOUR POINT EARLIER IN THIS IS COME UP SEVERAL TIMES. I DON'T WANT TO DIMINISH THE IMPORTANCE OF INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL THAT IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL. IN FACILITIES BUT I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT YOU'RE AWARE THAT THE LATEST WHAT THE LATEST RESEARCH IS TELLING US ABOUT HOLD ITS BREAD AND FACILITIES. THE LATEST RESEARCH FROM HARVARD FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO- AND FROM BROWN. IT'S BASICALLY TELLING US THAT THAT THAT THAT THE THERE IS NOT. REALLY A LOT OF CORRELATION IN TERMS OF THE QUALITY OF THE BUILDING. AND THE QUALITY THE HISTORY OF THE BUILDING IN TERMS OF ITS STAR RATING. IT'S INFECTION PREVENTION OR ANY OF THAT. WHAT IS CORRELATED MORE TOWARD KOBE IS THE INTENSITY OF COLD IN THE COMMUNITY. THE SIZE OF THE BUILDING- AND THINGS MORE THAT NATURE. SO IF YOU SEEN THE FIRST WRESTLING AND I STATES THAT HAD TO COPE WITH DEATH. WAS A FIVE STAR FACILITY THAT HAS HAPPENED ALSO HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO. SO I THINK THAT THE AGAIN NOT TO DIMINISH THE IMPORTANCE OF THOSE ISSUES. JUST TO LET YOU KNOW EVEN IN THE BEST FACILITIES. THAT THE ADEQUATE PP ABOUT THE ADEQUATE TESTING. THEY WERE ALL PRONE TO THE SITUATION AS PER. I APPRECIATE THAT AND I DON'T WANT TO BELIEVE IT THE POINT BUT OBVIOUSLY. I WAS IN. THE TO TIM THEN THE MINUTE I AM NOT WILL. AT WHICH- IS FIVE OR- IT'S A MATTER OF HOW YOU RUN THE FIRST. AND WHAT'S THEN YOU INTO. THAT ENSURES THE SAFETY SO WITH THAT. THANK YOU EXCUSE ME CHAIR MAC MAC THIS IS LISA COLEMAN IF I COULD RESPOND TO IT ALSO I'M I THINK PART OF THIS DISCUSSION WE ARE MISSING A MAJOR COMPONENT AND THAT IS THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH A LARGE PART OF THE FRUSTRATION AND INCONSISTENCIES IN THE BEGINNING THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY WHAT A DIFFERENT POSITION I DON'T THINK ANYONE WITH CALVET ACCEPT ONLY PERSONS THAT HAD NEGATIVE TESTING EXCEPT PEOPLE WITH CUT- CITY PERSON OUT BECAUSE THEY FELL DOWN BUT REQUIRE THAT THEY STAY IN THE HOSPITAL UNTIL THEY GET TO TEST TO PROVE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE IT. IT WAS THAT WAS THE INCONSISTENCY OF MESSAGING THAT COSTS SO MUCH PROBLEM IN THE BEGINNING AND THAT GOES BACK TO MY LEGISLATIVE REQUEST THOSE LOCAL PLANNING ORGANIZATIONS NEED TO HAVE AN EXPERT IN LONG TERM CARE. LOCAL. PUBLIC HEALTH. ARE INTIMATE AWARE OF WHICH SKILLED OR THE- HISTORICALLY STRUGGLES FROM. REGULATORY IN COMPLIANCE AND SO WHEN A HOSPITAL IS JUST CHARGING A CO THAT POSITIVE PERSON TO A FACILITY. THAT THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE OF A DECISION THAT WAS MADE BY EXPERTS OF FACILITY THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE OFFICE MANAGER AT THE FACILITY RATHER THAN THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OF THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. AND ALSO ON THE FUNDING I WOULDN'T TO POINT OUT THAT THERE IS ADDITIONAL FUNDING ON TOP OF THE 10% SKILLED NURSING FACILITY INTEREST YOU'RE LOOKING AT TO GET THIS COMING BUDGET. ABC THIRTEEN TWENTY NINE IS LOOKING TO GIVE THEM AN ADDITIONAL NINETY TWO MILLION IN GENERAL FUND. FOR QUALITY CARE. AND TO MY KNOWLEDGE THERE IS NOTHING IN THAT NINETY TWO MILLION DOLLARS THAT SAYS THEY HAVE TO PAY A LIVING WAGE. I AM THRILLED TO HEAR. THAT FACILITIES ARE PAYING HAZARD PAY. IT HAS A PAY NEEDS TO BE ALL THE TIME NOT JUST PHONE CODE IS RAPID. AND THAT NINETY TWO MILLION DOLLARS I BELIEVE THE STATE HAS AN OBLIGATION TO PUT A LINK. TO STAFFING. FOR THAT ADDITIONAL MONEY. THANK YOU. I'M GONNA HAVE THREE BRIEF QUESTIONS AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO WHAT OUR CALLER LIGHTNING ROUND- WE'RE GONNA HAVE DR WASSERMAN PAT MCGINNIS AND LISA COLEMAN WE TRAVEL AND OFTEN ASK. THAT THE OTHER THE STATE PAN STATE REGULATORS AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES EACH THAT WE ONE QUESTION- I'D WE HOPE WOULD HAVE MORE TIME TO DO THAT BUT HAVE MORE QUESTIONS BUT IT LOOKS LIKE WILL WILL HAVE SHORT SHORTER. SO MY FIRST QUESTION IS GOING TO BE. TO HIGH I MISSED. AND OCCUR. AND WHILE YOU'RE WALKING UP- TO THE TO THE CHAIR THERE- I WANNA I JUST. AS W AS WE LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF DEATHS IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES WHICH ARE ACCOUNT 450% ROUGHLY OF ALL THE DESPERATE FOR COATED IN THE ENTIRE STATE- WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT- THAT TRACING- BECAUSE WE- ARE WE ARE WE PUTTING THE TRACING ASSETS. THE WORDS OF ANY PURPOSE IN A PROPORTIONAL WAY TO TRACK THESE CASES I KNOW THAT WE ARE. I KNOW THE GOAL WAS TO HAVE TEN THOUSAND TRACERS IN PLACE WHERE I THINK WORD ABOUT THREE THOUSAND- AND WE SO I THINK WE'RE LAGGING ON THAT SO HOW ARE WE TREATING THIS AND COMMUNITIES- WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF SPREAD BECAUSE OF THE WORKERS OBVIOUSLY. A MOVIE THE MULTIPLE FACILITIES BUT HOW MUCH ARE WE FOCUSING ON TRACING TO HELP WITH THESE OUTBREAKS. ONE OF THE NEW EFFORTS THE TRACING IS GONNA BE SPECIFICALLY FOCUS WAS SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES SO. AS I MENTIONED EVERY SKILLED NURSING FACILITY- THIS MONTH NEEDS TO COMPLETE THEIR BASED LIKE TESTING WHICH MEANS EVERYONE IS TESTED. I'M AT THE POINT THAT THERE IS EVEN JUST ONE PERSON. OF WAS POSITIVE. THEN THE HAVE CONTACT TRACING GOING ON WITH THAT WITH ANYONE WHO'S TESTING POSITIVE- SO THAT WE CAN NOT ONLY BE ABLE TO CO HORT APPROPRIATELY- SO YOU OF POSITIVES AND IN ONE AREA. POTENTIAL EXPOSURES IN ONE AREA EVEN IF THEY TESTED NEGATIVE ON THE FIRST TEST. AND THOSE WHO WEREN'T EXPOSED OVER NEGATIVE IN ANOTHER AREA. BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT BEEN THERE CONTACT TRACING DECEIT. WHETHER OR NOT WAS IT A HELP WORKERS WHO WORKED IN ANOTHER FACILITY BECAUSE THAT IS. THE CASE. FOCUS ON. WELL UPSET WHEN THEY DID TO AFTER A- DOES THEIR OF THEIR BAY LIKE TEN OF THE WILL THE CONTINUE TO. TESTING AND EVERYTHING TIME THERE IS THAT POSITIVE THAT WE WILL THEN IMMEDIATELY WORK WITH CONTACT TRACING WITH THAT. SO WE DO HAVE CONTACT TRACERS THAT WE ACTUALLY REDEPLOYED OR RE DIRECTED SOME OF OUR OWN. OF THE SURVEY OUR STAFF SO WE DO HAVE SOME SURVEY OR STOP ON OUR TEAM WHO ARE OVER SIXTY FIVE OR WHO CAN'T DO- ONSITE. AND FOR THOSE STAFF WE DEDICATE TO SOME OF THESE. TAX RATES IN EFFORTS. SO THAT THEY CAN BEGIN SINCE THEY ALREADY IN. A RELATIONSHIP THEY THESE DIFFERENT FACILITIES THEY CAN BE ABLE TO DO. CONTACT CRAZY JUST HAPPENED TO BE. AN INVESTIGATIVE FIRST THE TO CAN DO. OFF SITE AND SO THE ONE FOR WAY THAT WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO. NOT ONLY JUST GO TOP FROM THE YOU KNOW THE TEN THOUSAND THAT YOU HEAR THAT'S REQUIRED FOR CONTACT RAISING THE STATE. BUT TRYING TO HAVE A DEDICATED TEAM OF CONTACT TRACERS. FOR JUST OR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES FOR THIS PURPOSE. OKAY THANK YOU SO THAT IS THAT. THAT'S HAPPENING NOW OR IS THAT IN THE- IS THAT IN THE IN THE FUTURE THAT'S HAPPENING NOW AS WE'RE GETTING OUR TESTING RESULTS IN. EVERYONE WE SPENT ON A I FELT LAST WEEK REQUIRING ALL FACILITIES TO BE ABLE TO- TURN IN ALL OF THEIR TESTING RESULTS. SO THAT ONCE WE GET THOSE TESTING RESULTS THEN WE THEN ON SENT OUT TEAMS TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT CONTACT TRACY WE HAVE THE- AND WHERE ARE E IN THE PROGRESS OF TESTING- EMPLOYEES OF FACILITIES IN MY OWN COMMUNITY OF SANTA ROSA. WE HAVE- HEALTHCARE HEALTHCARE WORKERS CAN ACTUALLY GO AND GET YOU TESTED THROUGH DRIVE THROUGH- THEY CAN GO THEY CAN GO ONCE EVERY COUPLE OF WEEKS- I'VE HEARD IT A THOUSAND REFERENCES IN THE PRESS THAT WE COULDN'T POSSIBLY TEST EVERYBODY. WHO NEEDS TO BE TESTED YET WE'RE OFFERING THAT IN OUR COMMUNITY SO WHERE ARE WE IN THAT TESTING- BECAUSE THE ONCE OF THESE ARE. POINTING TAX RIGHT SO COULD GO AND GET THE NEXT WEEK N. N. ANCHOR BACK IN IN FACT IN FACT PEOPLE IN THE FACILITY SO- THAT THAT. HAS BEEN FROM THE VERY BEGINNING BECAUSE. TESTING FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS IN THESE FACILITIES. SO I DO HAVE A DOCTOR HERE EIGHTEEN HERE FROM CITY PA TO WAS ON THE- CO CHAIR OF THE TESTING TASK FORCE BUT I'LL GO AHEAD SPEAK TO A LITTLE BIT OF THIS PIECE THAT WE DO HAVE AN AGGRESSIVE- TESTING- PLAN FOR CALIFORNIA ASKING THAT THEY RETEST EVERY SEVEN DAYS THAT THEY ARE POSITIVE FOR THE OUT POPULOUS AS WELL AS THE SURVEILLANCE TESTING THIS FOCUSED ON THE HEALTH CARE WORKERS 25% OF THOSE HEALTHCARE WORKERS EVERY WEEKS THAT YOU HAVE A 100% SO IT'S CONSTANT. OF BUT WE DO HAVE THE CAPACITY TO TESTING CALIFORNIA WE HAVE SEVERAL STATE LABS WE HAVE A LINK WE HAVE PRIVATE LABS WE HAVE ACADEMIC RESEARCH HOSPITALS WE ARE RICH WITH LABS IN IN CALIFORNIA IT'S A MATTER OF MAKING SURE THAT WE HELP AND PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON HOW TO GET TESTED. I THINK THE BIGGEST- UP THERE YOU'RE THAT I SEEN IS INITIALLY IT'S NOT OVERWHELMING OF HOW DO I TEST WELL YOU KNOW TWO HUNDRED- STAFF IN MY IN MY LOCATION BECAUSE I THINK REGIONALLY PEOPLE THINKING CAP OUT LOUD WHERE THEY WERE THINKING REGIONALLY AND WE'RE TELLING NOT LOOK AT THIS WHOLE LIST HERE'S A LIST OF LABS HERE'S THE LIST OF TYPES OF ALL OF THE SERVICES THAT THEY OFFER THAT LAB. SO DO MOBILE TEAM THAT WILL GO OUT- AND- DO WITH THE ROAD MOBILE VAN WE ALSO HAVE DRIVE THROUGH SEEN WE HAVE TESTING THAT AVAILABLE- KIND OF ITS THIS TIME OUT THE SPECIMEN IS AN AND BRING THAT. RIGHT A DIFFERENT OPTION JUST ABOUT CAN SURE THAT EVERYONE HAS A TOOLS RESOURCES. NOTE TO ACCESS THEM AND KNOWS HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE THEY'RE GETTING THAT. DONE OF TESTING WAS OF THE- IN THE MID. PLAN THAT WERE REQUIRED FOR ALL OF OUR AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES TO TURN IN THEIR MEDICATION PLAN BY JUNE FIRST- WE HAVE A 100% OF ALL OF OUR NURSING- SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES TO TURN IN A MEDICARE. PLAN AND SO NOW OUR TEAMS ARE GOING THROUGH THOSE PLANS MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY ACTING ON. THE TESTING IN THE OTHER ITEMS THAT REQUIREMENTS IN THERE. BUT I DON'T OF DOCTOR JEANNIE WHAT'S THAT ACTUALLY WE'RE WE'RE IND OF SHORT ON TIME SO I MEAN IT HAS. A BABY CAN GET THAT IN WRITING OR SOURCE OF FURTHER THE CONVERSATION OFFLINE SO I APOLOGIZE DR DEAN I'M GONNA. ASK WE WANT OKAY. I DID AND THIS A COMMENT. AND THEN AND THEN AS A COMMENT FOR- CAMAGUEY WEIGHED A JUST IN GENERAL- AND I WOULD ASK THAT YOU COULD GET BACK TO US ON THIS. I NEVER DID REALLY HEAR AN ANSWER TO DOCTOR RANDY THIS QUESTION ABOUT. HOW WE'RE GOING TO TRANSITION FROM PROGRAMS LIKE M. S. S. P. AND C. BASS IF- ALTHOUGH WE HAVE. IN THE ASSEMBLY PUSH BACK ON THAT'S CUTS- BUT I NEVER HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT A TRANSITION PERIOD LOOK LIKE BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THOSE PARTIES ARE GOING TO END ON JULY ONE. WITH SENIORS TO HAVE NOTHING. AND BUT WITH THERE IS A PROGRAM THAT MIGHT GET GOING IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. BUT THERE WAS NO COMMENT THERE WAS THERE REALLY WASN'T AN ANSWER THAT SO I WOULD REALLY LIKE- AN ANSWER. TO THAT TO THE- TO THE OUR BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIR- INTO OUR OFFICE AS WELL. I WOULD SAY THIS IN GENERAL ON YOUR ON THE MASTER PLAN ON AGING AS WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT. TO EMPHASIZE FLEXIBILITY FOR COMMUNITIES- MY COMMUNITIES THAT ARE IN THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT DO NOT LOOK LIKE. LOS ANGELES- THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE- SAN FRANCISCO. THERE SMALL RURAL AND OFTEN HAVE A VERY LIMITED RESOURCES AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT AS WE- LOOK AT THAT WE HAVE ACTUALLY HAVE FLEXIBILITY- IN IN OUR IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND I I'M AND I APPRECIATE. ALSO THAT YOU REFERENCED THE IMPORT OF LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN. BUT IT WOULD OUT THAT IT WAS ALSO SUBJECT TO A MAJOR BUDGET CUTS. AND A AT A TIME WHEN I THINK WE NEED THAT THE MOST. AND THAT'S THAT'S PRETTY PRETTY DOES HEART AND SO. I DO HAVE A FINAL QUESTION AND THAT IS IN AS FOR. MR CORNET. AND MOVE ON TO WORK. WE'RE GONNA HAVE OUR- PANEL. PAMELA PAM QUESTIONS MISTER. SAID THAT YOU WE WERE HAMPERED BY A LATE START NASH. INTERNATIONALLY STATE- IF YOU'RE YOU'VE BEEN PLAGUED WITH INADEQUATE PP TESTING- I WOULD POINT OUT THAT- ABOUT 67% OF RESIDENTS OF SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES ARE ARE MEDI CAL. THEN ANOTHER 25230% ARE MEDICARE- AND SO THERE ARE THERE NOT A HUGE NUMBER OF PRIVATE PAY. SO THE VAST MAJORITY OF INCOME TO SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES IS GOVERNMENT. AND WITH THAT- SHOULD IS OVERSIGHT AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH- SO INVOLVED IN OVERSEE. I AM CONCERNED AND FRUSTRATED THE FIRST OUTBREAKS OF CODED OF SIGNIFICANCE WERE IN LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES IN WASHINGTON. EARLY EARLY. WHEN DID YOU BEGAN TO TRY TO ACQUIRE YOUR OWN PP AND I POINT THIS OUT BECAUSE THE VAST MAJORITY OF YOUR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES ARE FOR PROFIT AND THEY'RE MAKING. A LOT OF MONEY. SO WHEN DID YOU BEGIN TO CA CHOIR PP WHEN DID YOU BEGIN TO DO THE- INFECTION CONTROL PROTOCOLS. AND HOW ARE WE GOING TO GO FORWARD ON THIS BECAUSE IT IS YOU ARE FOR PROFIT ENTITIES COMING WITH YOUR HAND OUT TO US- TO TAKE CARE OF THINGS. IN IT IT APPEARS THAT YOU DID NOT IN SOME CASES DID NOT HAVE- PLANS IN PLACE DID NOT HAVE PROTOCOLS IN PLACE. DID NOT HAVE ADEQUATE STAFF- BECAUSE OF THE TURNOVER- SO WHEN DID YOU BEGIN TO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY- AND- WHAT IS YOUR PLAN GOING FORWARD. YEAH THANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I WOULD SAY THAT THE THAT THE PROFESSION TOOK IT SERIOUSLY FROM THE FROM THE GET GO WHEN- ON WHAT DATE. IT'S LIKE I CAN'T SAY THE EXACT DATE BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT I WAS ON A CALL WITH MY COUNTERPART IN THE STATE OF WASHINGTON THE SAME WEEK. THAT IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THERE WAS A AT AND I'M ON NASH CALLS WITH THE HEALTHCARE. EVERY WEEK WITH THE STATE EXECUTIVES IN ALL FIFTY STATES WE TALK ABOUT THESE ISSUES SHARE WHAT'S GOING ON AND WE WERE HEARING ABOUT THIS BILL TIME. SO THE ISSUE THOUGH WE WE'VE HEARD ABOUT WE DIDN'T KNOW AT THAT POINT THEY'LL WITH HOW THAT MUCH OUT OF HOW SPREADING- OR ANYTHING ELSE I WILL ALSO. GIVE. MARCUS HE STOCKPILE TO A DEGREE BUT THEY'LL STOP DID NOT LIE IN ADDITION THEY NOT A EVERY ALL THE NINETY FIVE MASS OF WHICH WAS THE IMPORTANT NUMBER YEAH THING I WOULD POINT IS THERE ARE TWO MAJOR SUPPLIERS TO OF PP IN CALIFORNIA BOTH OF THOSE COMPANIES THAT'S WHY THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE SUPPLIES- IT BECAUSE WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN IN TERMS OF THE PRODUCTION. THE PRODUCTION CHANGE THE STARTING IN CHINA- VERY EARLY ON THEY DIDN'T HAVE SUPPLIES AND THEN ANY OF THOSE- PROVIDERS THEY WE TALKED PROVIDE- EVERY WEEK THE WE TALKED TO THE FTP PROVIDERS EVERY WEEK THEY WERE TELLING US WELL WE CAN MAKE 50% OF THE NORMAL ORDER FOR OUR FOR OUR CUSTOMERS- THIS NEXT WEEK WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO GET BACK TO THAT BUT THAT START VERY BUT I WAS THE- SAY THAT THERE WAS JUST. A WOULD WE GOT SO HI THIS. THE P. M. AND ALL BECAUSE AGAIN BECAUSE WHETHER THINGS TO MENTIONED LACK TESTING AT. ALL AS WELL. AND THERE NOT. THIS THIS PROFESSION MORE THAN ANY OTHER PART. IT IS HEAVILY IT'S THE MOST OF MOST IN MEDI CAL LEAST IS THE MOST. A GOVERNMENT FUNDED OF ANY PART OF THE HEALTH CARE STRUCTURE. UP IN THE MEDI CAL RATES HAVE NEVER BEEN ADEQUATE THE MEDICARE RATES ARE BETTER THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. BUT AT THE SAME TIME. THE THIS CENSUS THE CENSUS WAS COMING DOWN ON THE MEDICARE POPULATION BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE NOT COMING OUT OF THE HOSPITAL- THE HOSPITALS WERE NOT DOING SURGERIES- ITSELF IS STILL THESE WERE EVEN MORE SWEET FINANCE. I'D ALSO POINT OUT TO BY THE WAY THAT EVEN HIT ANY OF FACILITIES AT THIS POINT NOT THAT'S OKAY THERE WASN'T MY QUESTION ACTUALLY IS YEAH I JUST APPRECIATEAPPRECIATE THAT SO- THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I CAN ITS ONE EMPHASIZED- AS SOON AS WE KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON I THINK PEOPLE TRY TO BE ON TOP OF AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. GET IT IS CHANGING THE. GEN WHAT WE ABOUT THE SYMPTOMS IS. WE DIDN'TIT DOESN'T TELL IT A- DEVASTATED KIRKLAND WASH. WE DO NOT KNOW INITIALLY. THAT THE A SYMPTOMATIC PEOPLE COULD BE TRANSFERRED. INTO SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES SB SPREADING THE DISEASE- WITHOUT ANY ANY ANY SYMPTOMS SHOWING AT ALL THAT WAS THAT WAS LATE INFORMATION AND THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY DEVASTATING BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE WERE TRANSFERRED FROM HOSPITALS. WHO HAD NOT BEEN TESTED ON THE THEORY THAT THEY WERE A SYMPTOMATIC. AND BY THAT POINT WAS PROBABLY TOO LATE. THANK YOU- I THINK THIS THIS ALL OF THIS WHOLE CONVERSATION BAGS THAT WILL WILL BE HAVING THIS IS ANOTHER HEARING ON THIS- BECAUSE AND I WILL BE SUBMITTING QUESTIONS IN ADVANCE OF THAT AS I AS I. SUSPECTED MISTER NAZARIAN WILL AS WELL I'D LIKE TO MOVE ON NOW- QUICKLY TO WE HAVE- EACH EACH OF OUR OTHER PANELISTS TO ASK A SINGLE QUESTION. YOU PICK WHO YOU WANT TO ASK YOU TO AND THEN- I DO WE WILL- THEY WILL MOVE ON OUR TO OUR PUBLIC COMMENT SO DR WASSERMAN YOU HAVE A QUESTION. ANY ANY OF OUR PANELISTS THERE YEAH. YES I HAVE A QUESTION FOR MR OCCURRED I DO WANT TO LET YOU KNOW OUR- MICHAEL COMMENTS WILL ADDRESS A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS. SURE MEMBERS ABOUT. AT I WOULD. SAY THE TWO WILL BE MARCH THE EXPERTS YOU JURY AFTER TO MARCH CARE BEEN. GUEST TRY TO SHARE OUR EXPERT WITH FEET AGENT. WE UNDERSTOOD SO LEADERS ON. IN MORE. WE HONOR A SIM SPREAD I ACTUALLY HAVE TO DISAGREE WITH THE COMMENTS MADE ON A SYMPTOMATIC SPREAD. THE DATA WOULD BEAR THE EXPERTS KNEW ABOUT A SYMPTOMATIC SPREAD BY MID MARCH- IN FACT WE TESTED AT THE LOS ANGELES JEWISH HOME ALL OF OUR STAFF AND RESIDENTS. BY THE END OF MARCH BASED ON THIS KNOWLEDGE. THE OTHER THING IS ON MARCH THIRTEENTH WE RECOMMENDED THAT THE GOVERNOR MANDATE FULL TIME INFECTION PREVENTION OF SO. I APPRECIATE THE MOVEMENT TO IMPROVE SERVICE PROCESS BUT I THINK IT'S CRITICAL IT'S CPA CAN GAUGE THE EXPERTS IN GERIATRICS LONG TERM CARE. AS WELL AS THE REGULAR. BUT YOU'D BE ON BUDGET AND IN. DEVELOPING THIS PROCESS. WE'LL TALK ABOUT IN A WOODED. BUT WITH ALL DUE. I AM VERY. H. CAN COME UP WITH EFFECTIVE PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS WITHOUT WERE WITH THE EXPERTS IN AFTER TO MORE TERM CARE SO WHAT I WILL TO ASK YOU IS MY ORGANIZATION. WHAT WAS APPEAR TO ORGANISE. IS WORKING TO CONVENE A OF EXPERTS TO DEVELOP RECOMMENDED ON HOW TO ACTUALLY IMPROVE THE SURVEY PROCESS WHAT I'D LIKE TO ASK MR OCCURS MISSION CONNECT TO A TRUE COLLABORATIVE PROCESS. IN THE EXPLOSION GERIATRICS AND LONG TERM CARE BENEFIT. IN NOT ONLY GIVING INPUT BUT ACTUALLY BEING PART OF THE PLANNING PROCESS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS NEW APPROACH. DR WASSERMAN AND IT'S GOOD TO HEAR YOUR VOICE AS SO WE SPEAK OFTEN- NOT ONLY JUST pON A WEEKLY BASIS BUT- OFTEN ON EVEN OF PRE PANDEMIC SO ALWAYS APPRECIATE YOUR PARTNERSHIP AND YOUR EXPERTISE PARTICULARLY YOUR TEAM AS A WHOLE. SO YES I WILL OF COURSE CAN BET TO HAVE YOU AND YOUR TEAM AS WELL AS OTHER- PARTNERS AT THE TABLE TO BE PART OF THESE PLANNING PROCESSES IN FACT- YOU'LL SEE STRAPS OF THESE- COMING YOUR WAY. SOON MUCH LIKE I'VE SHARED SO MANY OTHER ALL FACILITY LETTER- WITH YOU AND YOUR TEAM FOR YOUR INPUT. OF I ALSO WANT TO THINK DOCTOR WALKED IN AND FIFTEEN FOR BEING PART OF OUR COLLABORATIVE- AUTHORS EVERY THURSDAY YOU DO INFECTION PREVENTION CALL FOR ALL OVER SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES ALONG WITH- EIGHT STEP BACK. AND AS WELL AS WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO PULL AND OTHER PARTNERS INTO THIS BUT JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WE COMMIT. WITH US IT WILL TRY TO PROVIDE A LEADERSHIP AND DIRECTION. TO THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY CAN BE. THANK YOU YOU WELCOME. THANK YOU MISS ME GET YOU HAVE A QUESTION FOR ANY OF OUR PANELISTS. NINETY ONE CONTENT OF WHERE THIRTY SEVEN YEARS SINCE I'VE BEEN DOING THIS BUT HEARD THE NURSING HOME INDUSTRY. GIVE US MORE MONEY WILL PROVIDE BETTER CARE AND HAVEN'T HAPPENED YET HOWEVER I WANT TO HAVE TO SIGN UP FOR A COUPLE OF THINGS NUMBER ONE THOUSAND SURVEYS DONE DURING THE HEIGHT OF THE PANDEMIC- INFECTION CONTROL SURVEYS. NOTED ABSOLUTELY NO DEFICIENCIES AND SECONDLY IS THAT CAN BE CORRECTED AND SECONDLY- WE NEED TO STOP THE- STAFFING WAIVERS. AND I'M WONDERING IF THE DEPARTMENT IS LOOKING AT THAT WE KNOW THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ARE AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH THAT THE NURSING.

BUT AGAIN IN THESE FACILITIES IN ADDITION THE THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY CITATIONS THERE ARE MANY- THAT YOU WOULD NOTED THAT ALSO DIDN'T HAVE THE SLIGHTEST. BUT THAT THERE WAS NOT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEIR VALUE. I THINK THAT WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT IN ORDER TO HAVE QUALITY AND SAFETY AND THE FACILITY. IT IS A MIXTURE BETWEEN PROVIDING THE TOOLS AND RESOURCES AND EDUCATION FOR PEOPLE TO BE SUCCESSFUL. AND OTHER TIMES THERE ARE THERE ARE PLACES WHERE YES WE HAVE THE CARROT AND HAVE TO STICK. WE DO USE. DO YOU HAVE OF THE CITATIONS ON ON ON AS WELL I. OVERNIGHT WHEN WE LOOK AT STAFF. QUESTION REGARDING STAFFING I DO KNOW THAT ARE FOR THE- THAT HE HAD A RICH PUT OUT THERE TO BE ABLE TO HELP THE HOW AS MUCH LIKE TO AS POSSIBLE DURING THE PANDEMIC WE KNOW THAT THOSE WAIVERS DO EXPIRE OF APPLIED JUNE THIRTIETH- AND WE WILL BE WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND ASSESSING WHAT THE NEXT STEPS WOULD SITUATION WILL BE GOING FOR.
