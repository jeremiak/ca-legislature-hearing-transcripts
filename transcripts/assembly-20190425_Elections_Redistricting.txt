HE TO THE HURCH RECOMMENDATION TO BE BRIEF. I THINK IT'S CHAIR ABC SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FOUR WOULD ESTABLISH OPEN SOURCE -- PAPER BALANCE JUSTIN'S A PROGRAM TO AUTHORIZE THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO ADMINISTER MATCHING FUNDS TO PARTICIPATING COUNTY SO THEY COULD SPEED UP THE DEVELOPMENT CERTIFICATION. AND GOVERNANCE IN DISTRIBUTION OF OPEN SOURCE VOTING THIS IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. I AND I NOW HAVE A COUPLE WITNESSES WILL ALSO ELABORATE ON THIS POINT GREG MAJOR. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR -- COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE CURRENTLY PRESENT CALIFORNIA MONEY CAMPAIGN WERE A PROUD TO SPONSOR AT THIS BILL AND AND VERY THANKFUL TO THE LEADERSHIP OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO AS WELLS AS SOME MEMBERS CHIU AND GONZALEZ -- THIS IS THE TIME WHEN I THINK WE'VE ALL SEEN THAT ARE ELECTIONS ARE UNDER ATTACK -- AND THIS IS A TIME WHEN WE HAVE SEEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN UNFORTUNATELY THAT OUR ELECTION SYSTEMS ARE NOT SECURE. THE DEF CON THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN DEF CON SECURITY CONFERENCE THAT TESTS VOTING SYSTEMS -- FOUND A TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THAT EVERY PIECE OF EQUIPMENT THAT THEY TESTED -- WAS BREACHED IN SOME MANNER AND THEY DECLARE THAT IS A NATIONAL SECURITY RISK -- WE AND AND MANY OTHERS -- MANY OTHER COMPUTER EXPERTS BELIEVE THAT OPEN SOURCE A A PUBLICLY OWNED PAPER BALLOT VOTING SYSTEMS WOULD BE MORE SECURE IT'S A LITTLE BIT COUNTERINTUITIVE -- BECAUSE YOU THINK THAT -- THAT WHEN -- CODE IS PUBLISHED THAT THE BAD GUYS WILL BE ABLE TO SEE IT BUT THE BAD GUYS AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO HACK THE CODE ANYWAYS -- AS WE HAVE WE SEEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN. WHAT HAVING THE CODE IN PUBLIC MEANS THAT THE GOOD GUYS CAN LOOK AT THE DETAILS FIGURE OUT THE PROBLEMS POINT OUT YOU GOT A PROBLEM THERE GOT A SECURITY ISSUE -- PLEASE FIX IT SO -- THAT'S WHY OPEN SOURCE IS MORE SECURE FROM A BUDGETARY STANDPOINT WILL ALSO SAVE -- SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF MONEY THAT ARE CURRENTLY PAID TO PROPRIETARY VOTING MACHINES THAT'S WHY THERE'S A LONG LIST OF OF PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT THIS AND AND IT'S THE CHANCE FOR CALIFORNIA TO LEAD. LOS ANGELES COUNTY IN SAN FRANCISCO COUNTIES ARE IN. THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING SYSTEMS -- THE MATCHING FUNDS PROPOSED IN THIS IN THIS BILL WILL HELP THEM DEVELOP IT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE GET IT CERTIFIED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND THEN JUST AS IMPORTANTLY. SHARE IT WITH OTHER -- COUNTIES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE ONCE IT'S DEVELOPED BY THE COUNTY THAT BENEFIT FROM THIS EVERY COUNTY IN THE STATE WILL BE ABLE TO USE IT FOR FREE AND FACT EVERY COUNT THE IN THE NATION GREAT WILL BE ABLE TO USE A FREE SO THAT'S WHY WE SUPPORT THE SYNERGY -- SUPPORT THANK YOU. CHAIRMAN MEMBERS NICKEL SADDAM WAS CALIFORNIA COMMON CAUSE. IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION FOR FOR SIMILAR REASONS REALLY WHEN WE LOOK AT OPEN SOURCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN INVESTMENT IN MUCH STRONGER SECURITY. BUT HAVING MORE EYES ON THE CODE YOU'VE GOT MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO SPOT OF MALICIOUS SAID INTRUSIONS AS WELL AS SIMPLY BUGS. I'LL JUST BRIEFLY READ FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE IS OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE FAQ FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS. THE DOD STATES MAKING SOURCE CODE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC SIGNIFICANTLY AIDS -- DEFENDERS CONTINUOUS AND BROAD CARE VIEW ENABLE BY PUBLICLY AVAILABLE SOURCE CODE IMPROVE SOFTWARE RELIABILITY AND SECURITY THROUGH THE IDENTIFICATION AND ELIMINATION OF DEFECTS MIGHT OTHERWISE GOING RECOGNIZED BY THE POOR DEVELOPMENT TEAM. CONVERSELY WHEN SOURCE CODE IS HIDDEN FROM THE PUBLIC ATTACKERS CAN ATTACKED SOFTWARE ANYWAYS. IN ADDITION TO SECURITY WE'RE JUST POINT OUT THAT YES THIS REALLY IS A DOWN PAYMENT TO TO FUTURE COST SAVINGS WHEN YOU HAVE OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE. THE LOWER COUNTIES CAN USE THIS IS A REAL ABILITY TO DRIVE DOWN COSTS. JUST A FEW THE LAST YEAR WE DID A HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR MILLION AS INITIAL DOWN PAYMENT FOR NEW VOTING EQUIPMENT US WEST ESTIMATES ARE. THE NEEDS ARE IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS FOR UPDATING OUR VOTING EQUIPMENT WE THINK THIS INVESTMENT WILL PAY DIVIDENDS THE STATE'S FUTURE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

IN PREVIOUS YEARS DURING THE SENSITIVE -- ALWAYS SEEM CHALLENGES AND COUNTING IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AND OTHERS THAT ARE HARD TO REACH COMMUNITIES. ARE SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF TRUST IN THE GOVERNMENT LACK OF UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE CENSUS LANGUAGE BARRIERS TO COMPLETE THE CENSUS DISTRACTIONS FROM ABOUT THE AS COMMUNITY LEADERS. AND OTHER REASONS THAT ARE REALLY LONG TOO LONG TO LIST THIS UPCOMING THOUSAND CENSUS WE FACE ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES GIVEN THE POLITICAL CLIMATE IN THE POSSIBILITY OF A CITIZENSHIP QUESTION.

MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS BERMAN. BERMAN HI GALLAGHER GALLAGHER AYE CALDERON. CALDERON AYE LOW. LOW AYE MAYES MAYES AYE MULLIN. MULLIN AYE WHETHER. WEBER I THAT IS UNANIMOUSLY SUPPORTED SEVEN OF HAUTE -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. NEXT UP WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'VE GOT AB TWELVE SEVENTEEN MISTER MULLIN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE CONSULTED EVEN JONES FOR HIS EXTENSIVE WORK ON THIS ISSUE. AND TO INDICATE THAT I WANT TO OF STEPS EXCEPT THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS AB TWELVE SEVENTEEN SEEKS TO EXTEND THE CALIFORNIA DISCLOSE ACT. TO COVER ISSUE ADS THAT ARE INTENDED INFLUENCE LEGISLATIVE AND ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS AND ALSO CLOSE A LOOPHOLE FOR ELECTION HEARING COMMUNICATIONS THAT ATTACKER SUPPORT CANDIDATES DURING ELECTION SEASON. WITHOUT EXPRESSLY ADVOCATING FOR THEIR ELECTION OR DEFEAT. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN I AUTHORED AB TWO FOUR NINE THE CALIFORNIA DISCLOSE ACT WHICH WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. THAT IS CLOSE ACT MADE STRIDES IN ADDRESSING PREVIOUS LACKS CAMPAIGN FINANCE DISCLOSURE POLICIES THE MEASURE APPROVED THE CLARITY OF THE FORMATTING OF DISCLOSURES OF TOP FUNDERS. A BALLOT MEASURE AN INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURE ADS ON TV RADIO PRINT AND COMMON FORMS OF ELECTRONIC MEDIA. IT ALSO ESTABLISH NEW EARMARKING RULES TO IDENTIFY ORIGINAL DONORS TO COMMITTEES AND BALLOT MEASURES. LAST YEAR I AUTHORED THE FOLLOW UP LEGISLATION AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY EIGHT THE SOCIAL MEDIA DISCLOSE ACT WHICH EXTENDS TO FOUR NINES REQUIREMENTS TO COVER ADDS ON SOCIAL MEDIA. EXISTING LAW REQUIRES PERSON TO SPEND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE IN ELECTION HEARING COMMUNICATIONS WITHIN FORTY FIVE DAYS OF AN ELECTION TO REPORT THE PAYMENT. IT DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY DISCLOSURE ON SUCH ADS NO SUCH REQUIREMENT EXISTS FOR ISSUE ADVERTISING ISSUE ADVERTISEMENTS THAT ATTEMPT TO PRESSURE LEGISLATORS TO INFLUENCE LEGISLATIVE OUTCOMES. ARE A GROWING ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE LAST YEAR GROUP CALLED CAL INNOVATES PLACED OVER FOUR HUNDRED ADS ON FACEBOOK TRYING TO KILL A NET NEUTRALITY BILL. THIS YEAR THERE ARE SEVERAL ADS RUNNING ON VARIOUS FORMS OF MEDIA CLEARLY DESIGNED TO MOTIVATE PUBLIC INTERACTION WITH LEGISLATORS ON ISSUES SUCH AS POLICE USE OF FORCE. AS WELL AS LOCAL HOUSE. PARTY LOCAL HOUSING CONSTRUCTION. MOVIE CLEAR THERE IS NOTHING WRONG IN FACT I STRONGLY SUPPORT PUBLIC INTERACTION IN THE PROCESS OF LAWMAKING. MY ONLY GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PUBLIC IS INFORMED AS TO WHO IS ACTUALLY PAYING FOR THESE ADS WHO'S BEHIND THESE ADS. WHICH ARE REQUESTING THAT PARTICIPATION IF THE AT IS BEING PAID FOR BY CERTAIN INDUSTRY OR NONPROFIT GROUP THE PUBLIC MAY WANT TO CONSIDER WHETHER THE GROUP'S INTEREST OF LINE WITH THEIR INDIVIDUAL INTERESTS. THAT'S IT THAT'S THE PRINCIPLE THE BILL LAST YEAR. THE BRIGHT COALITION BLANKETED THE AIRWAVES WITH MESSAGES DEFUSING BLAME FOR WILDFIRES WITHOUT SAYING WHO PAID FOR THE ADS. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN PGA ANY SPENT OVER SIX MILLION DOLLARS ON CALL GRASSROOTS ANOTHER ADVOCACY RELATED TO STATE LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS. CLEARLY DESIGNED TO SHAPE PUBLIC OPINION. AB TWELVE SEVENTEEN DOESN'T IN ANY WAY LIMIT THAT ACT ACTIVITY YOUR THAT ABILITY. IT SIMPLY REQUIRES THAT GROUPS OR INDIVIDUALS BE CLEARLY IDENTIFIED IN THE AD AS THE TOP FUNDERS. ELECTIONEERING COMMUNICATIONS THAT TARGET CANDIDATES WITHOUT EXPRESSLY ADVOCATING FOR THEIR ELECTION OR DEFEAT ARE ALSO A GROWING PROBLEM WITH OVER TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS AND REPORTED EXPENDITURES SINCE. TWENTY TEN THEY ARE THERE IS A LOOPHOLE IN AB TWO FOUR NIGHTS REQUIREMENT THAT INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURE ADS FOR OR AGAINST CANDIDATES MUST CLEARLY SHOW THEIR TOP THREE FINDERS AND WE ARE TRYING TO CLOSE THAT LOOPHOLE. WITH THE SECOND PROVISION TWELVE SEVENTEEN AS A STRAIGHT FOR PROPOSAL IS SIMPLY EXTENDS THE SAME PRINCIPLES THIS LEGISLATURE APPROVED BY TWO THIRDS MAJORITY IN OUR LAST SESSION TO ADVERTISEMENT SEEKING TO AFFECT PUBLIC POLICY. THE SAME AS THOSE SEEKING TO IMPACT ELECTIONS I'VE BEEN WORKING EXTENSIVELY WITH LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL AS WELL AS THE COMMITTEE STAFF AS I INDICATED. TO GET THE BILL INTO ITS CURRENT STATE WHERE ENGAGE WITH THE F. PPC A LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEM AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE PROCESS TO ADDRESS. ANY TECHNICAL ISSUES WITH THAT'LL TURN IT OVER -- TO MY CHIEF SUPPORTERS AT THE TABLE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND PLEASE GIVE IT TWO MINUTES EACH THE THANK YOU A TREND LINE PRESENT THE CALIFORNIA CLEAN MONEY CAMPAIGN AGAIN A GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND AND AND MEMBERS -- WE THIS BILL OBVIOUSLY WE GREATLY APPRECIATE THE LEADERSHIP OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLIN. ON THE DISCLOSE ACT THROUGHOUT THE YEARS -- THIS BILL IS IS CLOSING IN IMPORTANT LOOPHOLE IN IN THE DISCLOSE ACT -- THE THESE. AND IT IS NARROWLY TAILORED TO TO DO SO AS HE DESCRIBED RIGHT NOW THERE IS A SPECIALLY LOOPHOLE WITH ELECTIONEERING COMMUNICATIONS WHERE THEY CAN ATTACK CANDIDATES WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OF THE GENERAL ELECTION THIRTY DAYS OF THE PRIMARY WITHOUT -- EXPRESSLY ADVOCATING FOR THEIR SUPPORTER TO FEET -- THE SUPREME COURT IN CITIZENS UNITED EIGHT OUT OF THE NINE JUSTICES -- SAID THAT THOSE WERE CONCERT IT WAS CONSTITUTIONAL -- TO REQUIRED DISCLOSURE ON THOSE TYPES OF ADS SO WE BELIEVE IT'S A STRONGLY -- THE CASE HERE AND THEN ISSUE ADVOCACY ADVERTISEMENTS VERY NARROWLY TERREL TAYLOR DOES NOT GOING. TO STOP SIERRA CLUB FROM SAYING YOU KNOW -- WE NEED TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE -- OR THE NRA FROM SAYING YOU KNOW -- WE WE WE DON'T NEED CONTROL CONTROL IT'S ONLY WHEN A ADD TARGETS A SPECIFIC PIECE OF LEGISLATION. A SPORT SPECIFIC ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION AND ASKED. THE PEOPLE TO TAKE ACTION BY COULD CONTACTING THEIR ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEGISLATOR THAT'S WE BELIEVES ARE CLEARLY POLITICAL ADS WHEN THEY DO THAT AND THOSE NARROW CIRCUMSTANCES THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN CRAFTED THIS WAY -- IT WHAT WE THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO EXTENDED THE DISCLOSE THAT REQUIREMENTS TO IT AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I MANAGER MISS FISHER WITH THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS A CALIFORNIA OF THE LEAGUE IS PLEASED TO SUPPORT AB TWELVE SEVENTEEN TO EXTEND THE CALIFORNIA DISCLOSE ACT TO COVER BOTH ELECTIONEERING COMMUNICATIONS.

EGGMAN SCISSORS THE SAME REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE AND TRANSPARENCY AS DIRECT -- CAMPAIGNER ADVERTISING. FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES ISSUE ADVERT ADVOCACY ADVERTISEMENTS ASSETS ARE DEFINED AND AB.

THANK YOU SIR. HI. WELL WE APPRECIATE IT NO NO SHOWS OF SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION DURING THE HEARING THANK. MS RICE JR [inaudible] YES SO [inaudible] I'M A YOU KNOW STRUGGLING A LITTLE BIT WITH THIS BILL IN THE SENSE THAT TIME I AM I HAVE BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF MEASURES ON TRANSPARENCY. THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED HOW THAT YOU RAN BEFORE -- DISCLOSE IN THE TOP THREE DONORS WHEN IT COMES. TO YOU KNOW. DELIBERATE POLITICAL ADS BY PACKS AND AND OTHERS -- IN THIS CASE YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE KIND OF MORE FOCUSED ON THE ISSUE HAD AREA OF THINGS. AND SO. AS I UNDERSTAND THAT. THOSE ARE LIKE. DIFFERENT GROUPS COULD BE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE COULD BE -- CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. WHERE THEY HAVE ESSENTIALLY COLLECTED MONEY FROM PEOPLE JUST TO ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF VARIOUS DIFFERENT ISSUES RIGHT -- AND SO THEY MIGHT RUN AN AD ULTIMATELY. GEARED AT ADVOCATING FOR THAT FOR FOR A SPECIFIC ISSUE -- AND YOU'RE SAYING ON THOSE ONES THEY WOULD HAVE. TO PUT THE TOP THREE DONORS RIGHT BUT THE PERSON MIGHT A DONATED RATE. JUST TO SUPPORT. THE GROUP ITSELF NOT NECESSARILY TO SAY HEY I WANT TO SUPPORT. PUTTING OUT THAT POLITICAL LAD RIGHT SUCH RIGHT FEEL LIKE IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FROM ONE MORE LIKE DONATING. TO POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEES. FOR THE SPECIFIC PURPOSES OF THAT ELECTION OF TRYING TO ADVOCATE ON THAT SAY THAT PROPOSITION OR FOR THAT CANDIDATE -- AS OPPOSED TO WEAR HEY WE'RE WE'RE KIND OF MORE GENERALLY COLLECTING CONTRIBUTIONS FROM PEOPLE TO SUPPORT. DIFFERENT YOU KNOW JUST THE PROMOTION OF IDEAS IN GENERAL RIGHT AND AND THOSE THOSE COMMITTEES MIGHT ULTIMATELY. DO OTHER THINGS OTHER THAN -- ISSUE ADVOCACY RIGHT. SO I MEAN IS THERE A DIFFERENT DISTINCTION THERE MAY BE KIND OF CAN YOU [inaudible] MAYBE JUST. RESPOND TO THAT A LITTLE BIT I JUST FEEL LIKE MAYBE THERE'S A LITTLE BIT. IT'S NOT THE SAME EXACT ANIMAL OR TELL ME WHAT IT IS YEAH. WHY APPRECIATE? THE POINT ASSEMBLY MAN I WOULD HAVE TO THINK THROUGH THAT ISSUE. A LITTLE BIT I GUESS SOB. IN ALLOWED TREND A BITE AT THAT APPLE. TO ME. NOT DIRECTLY ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION BUT IF YOU'LL ALLOW ME. TO ME THIS IS A NATURAL EXTENSION OF WHAT WE'VE DONE ON THE DISCLOSURE FRAUD THAT. YEAH WE HAVE FOCUSED ON THE CAMPAIGN SIDE. IN MY WAY OF THINKING. OF THE ISSUES THAT WE GRAPPLE WITH IN THIS BUILDING AND THE LEGISLATIVE SIDE. OF THIS EQUATION ARE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE CAMPAIGN SIDE BECAUSE ACTUAL PUBLIC BUSINESSES BEING DECIDED THIS BUILDING. I THINK WE NEED TO PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT. FOR VIEWERS OF A TELEVISION AD. WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE? AND WHAT THEIR PERSPECTIVE MIGHT BE I THINK THERE'S SO MUCH INFORMATION COMING OUT. THE AVERAGE VOTER. IF WE GET AT LEAST PROVIDE A SENSE OF WHO THE MAJOR FUNDERS ARE BEHIND THAT ORGANIZATION THESE ARE THESE ARE MAJOR FUNDERS BEHIND THAT GROUP. AND THAT GROUP HAS CHOSEN TO TRY TO INFLUENCE THIS BODIES PUBLIC WORK. IT JUST PROVIDES ADDITIONAL LAYER OF CONTEXT FOR THE PUBLIC AND BY EXTENSION THE PUBLIC INTEREST IS SERVED. YOUR POINT THOUGH ABOUT SPECIFYING THAT THAT CONTRIBUTION IS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO RUN AN ADVERTISEMENT. I CAN LOOK AT THAT ISSUE AND SEE IF THERE'S A WAY TO TIGHTEN THAT. TO DRAW THAT NEXUS I DON'T KNOW FROM A LEGAL OR EVEN A CONSTITUTIONAL STANDPOINT IF THAT GETS US INTO A DIFFICULT. UP UP POSITION FROM MEN FROM IT JUST THE AREA OF LAW BUT I WOULD ALLOW TRENT. WHO'S IMMERSED IN THESE KINDS OF ISSUES TO COMMENT ON THAT IF YOU HAVE AN ADDITIONAL COMMENT FOR MR GALLAGHER -- YEAH I I COULD CERTAINLY AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT SOMETHING MEMBER SAID THAT THE BILL DOES HAVE SOME PROVISIONS IN IT RIGHT NOW IF TO FOR INSTANCE -- ALLOW PEOPLE TO EXCLUDE THE MONEY THAT THEY GIVE UP FROM -- PURPOSES OF LOBBYING. SO THAT IF YOU SAY I WANT TO GIVE MONEY TO THE AND ARE A OR C. D. A. OR SIERRA CLUB FOR TO SUPPORT THEIR GENERAL STUFF BUT I DON'T WANT MY MONEY TO BE USED FOR LOBBYING. THAN A YOU THOSE FUNDS WOULD NOT BE ELIGIBLE TO BE USED NOR SHOW UP AS PART OF THE TOP THREE FUNDERS SIMILARLY IF THEY'RE USING ONLY SMALL DONORS -- FORT TO FUND THESE ADS THEN IT WOULD BE AGAIN THE ORGANIZATION THAT WOULD SHOW UP IN ALL CASES ORGANIZATION WHICH SHOW UP. BUT NOT ANY SPECIFIC TOP THREE FUNDERS SO THERE ARE SOME PROTECTIONS IN THERE RIGHT NOW WE BELIEVE BUT WE'RE CERTAINLY HAPPY. TO TO WORK TO TO TO MAKE ANY ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION TO MAKE THAT EXTRA CLEAR THAT PEOPLE REALLY DON'T WANT THEIR FUNDS TO BE USED FOR FOR LOBBYING ISSUE ADS OR LOBBYING THAN THAN THEY DON'T NEED TO BE TO DISCLOSE THE TOP THREE FUNDER GOOD. CAP. I NEED THIS NOT QUESTIONS COMMENTS SEEING NONE BRING BACK. TO MISS MELINDA CLOSE. WE JUST UP AGAIN THANK THE CHAIR AND AND COMMITTEE -- FOR THEIR GOOD WORK ON THIS ISSUE AND I KNOW THERE IS -- LABOR OPPOSITION ON THE MEASURE I AM COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE FOLKS THAT -- ARE OPPOSED TO THE LANGUAGE RIGHT NOW MY INTEREST IS NOT TO CREATE UNNECESSARY BURDEN SOME. REQUIREMENTS MY TEN IS A MORE INFORMED PUBLIC SO THE PUBLIC CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND WHO IS TRYING TO INFLUENCE THEM. AND INFLUENCE THIS LEGISLATURE AND I BELIEVE THE PUBLIC INTEREST WILL BE SER BY A. B. TWELVE SEVENTEEN I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR LIVE OUT. HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THANK YOU VERY MUCH HOW MUCH IS THE DISCLOSE ACT BROUGHT MUCH NEEDED TRANSPARENCY TO CAMPAIGN ADVERTISEMENTS.

MAY FIRST OFF -- I THINK -- THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING TO TRY TO ADDRESS AND ACCOMMODATE A SIMILAR THIS ISSUE. AS FORMER CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE AS WELL WE'VE ALWAYS TRIED TO INCREASE THE TYPE OF TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. WITHIN THE OUR ELECTORAL PROCESS -- THAT STILL CONTINUES TO THIS DAY AND I KNOW THAT ARE FOR A COMMITTEE MEMBERS CONTINUALLY ADVOCATE FOR THE SAME TYPE OF TRANSPARENCY THAT WE WISH TO SEE IN OUR ELECTIONS. UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE JUST THESE NOTIONS OF A CITIZENS UNITED AND THE NOTION THAT CORPORATIONS CAN SPEAK AS PEOPLE OF THAT IS SOMETHING THAT FUND MAINLY. I HAVE A DISAGREEMENT WITH AND WHAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU IS A BILL TO PREVENT CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS MADE DIRECTLY FROM BUSINESS ENTITIES AS DEFINED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS YOU MAY KNOW AND IS AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS THERE ARE TWENTY TWO STATES IN THE UNION THAT HAVE SIMILAR. TYPE OF PROPOSALS ON THE BOOKS WITH RESPECT TO RESTRICTING DIRECT CONTRIBUTIONS FROM BUSINESS ENTITIES. TO CANDIDATES FOR PUBLIC OFFICE. A SIMILAR MUST ALSO ADMIT THAT THIS IS. OF SOMEONE AWKWARD A 2% AS SUCH A A MEASURE BEING THAT SO WE ALL KNOW AS A LIKE TO OFFICIALS FOR PUBLIC OFFICE WE HAVE. TO A CAMPAIGN AND MAKE THE NECESSARY EFFORTS TO SUPPORT OUR REELECTION EFFORTS -- BUT I DO THINK THAT AS WE CONTINUE TO PLAY BY THE RULES WE MUST CONTINUALLY STRIVE. FOR THE TYPE OF THINGS THAT WE WISH TO SEE AN ENSURING THAT WE CAN GET CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS A TO REFLECT THE TYPE OF VALUES THAT WE HAVE AS PEOPLE AS THE AVERAGE CITIZEN IN OUR DEMOCRACY SO. AGAIN BEFORE YOU IT IS WILL RECOGNIZE THAT -- ARGUABLY THIS PROPOSALS ONE PROPOSAL TO GET. THE INFLUENCE OF MONEY OUT OF POLITICS BUT AS AS WELL REFLECTED IN THE ANALYSIS.

I CANNOT JUST SIT BY WITH THE STATUS QUO AND CONSUMABLE SUBMITS. TO OUR BODY FOR ADDITIONAL EFFORTS FOR CONSIDERATION WITH RESPECT TO ENCOURAGING THAT TYPE OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY IN OUR ELECTORAL PROCESS SO AGAIN. OF A FORCE IS THE PROPOSAL TO PROHIBIT CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS FROM BUSINESS ENTITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO CANDIDATES FOR STATE OFFICE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE.
