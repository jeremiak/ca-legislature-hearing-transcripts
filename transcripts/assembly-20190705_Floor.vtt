IN SUPPORT OF AB.

00:50:12.476 --> 00:50:12.943
ONE OH ONE THE PROBLEM OF

00:50:13.009 --> 00:50:14.578
HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA IS

00:50:14.644 --> 00:50:16.680
INCREDIBLY SEVERE AND PERVASIVE.

00:50:16.747 --> 00:50:18.849
DOWNED THE MEASURES OF THIS BILL

00:50:18.915 --> 00:50:20.784
WILL HELP A LITTLE.

00:50:20.851 --> 00:50:22.953
BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

00:50:23.019 --> 00:50:24.588
WE TAKE A PAUSE HERE.

00:50:24.654 --> 00:50:26.390
NOW TO HAVE A DISCUSSION AND DO

00:50:26.456 --> 00:50:27.491
SOME INTROSPECTION ABOUT THE

00:50:27.557 --> 00:50:28.592
PROBLEM OF HOMELESSNESS IN

00:50:28.658 --> 00:50:30.527
CALIFORNIA AND ARE SOLUTIONS FOR

00:50:30.594 --> 00:50:30.927
IT.

00:50:30.994 --> 00:50:32.662
AND I THINK A HEALTHY PART OF

00:50:32.729 --> 00:50:34.331
THAT DISCUSSION WOULD BE TO ASK

00:50:34.398 --> 00:50:34.898
OURSELVES SOME QUESTIONS FOR

00:50:34.965 --> 00:50:35.932
EXAMPLE.

00:50:35.999 --> 00:50:37.901
IF WE CONTINUE TO SPEND

00:50:37.968 --> 00:50:39.569
SUBSTANTIALLY MORE THAN OTHER

00:50:39.636 --> 00:50:41.037
STATES ON THIS HOMELESS PROBLEM.

00:50:41.104 --> 00:50:43.006
WHY DO WE CONTINUE O HAVE THE

00:50:43.073 --> 00:50:44.741
HIGHEST HOMELESSNESS OF ANY

00:50:44.808 --> 00:50:46.243
STATE IN THE COUNTRY?

00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:47.677
IF WE CONTINUE TO FUND THE

00:50:47.744 --> 00:50:48.478
CONSTRUCTION OF AFFORDABLE

00:50:48.545 --> 00:50:49.813
HOUSING WHY IS IT THAT WE CAN'T

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:51.381
BUILD.

00:50:51.448 --> 00:50:53.683
A ONE UNIT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:55.352
FOR LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED AND

00:50:55.419 --> 00:50:55.952
FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE

00:50:56.019 --> 00:50:57.320
STATE AND WHY IS A COST US MORE

00:50:57.387 --> 00:50:58.655
THAN HALF A MILLION DOLLARS TO

00:50:58.722 --> 00:50:59.423
BUILD UNITS OF AFFORDABLE

00:50:59.489 --> 00:51:00.724
HOUSING.

00:51:00.791 --> 00:51:02.325
IN SOME PARTS OF OUR STATE

00:51:02.392 --> 00:51:02.626
[inaudible]

00:51:02.692 --> 00:51:04.594
AND FINALLY.

00:51:04.661 --> 00:51:06.163
IF THIS S A PRIORITY FOR THE

00:51:06.229 --> 00:51:08.064
LEGISLATURE TO SOLVING FOR THE

00:51:08.131 --> 00:51:08.665
PAST FEW YEARS A CERTAINLY HAS

00:51:08.732 --> 00:51:09.800
BEEN.

00:51:09.866 --> 00:51:11.568
WHY DOES THIS PROBLEM CONTINUE

00:51:11.635 --> 00:51:12.702
TO GET WORSE?

00:51:12.769 --> 00:51:13.570
I'M SURE EVERYONE WAS PAYING

00:51:13.637 --> 00:51:15.071
ATTENTION TO OUR POINT IN TIME

00:51:15.138 --> 00:51:16.406
COUNTS IN THE LAST SEVERAL

00:51:16.473 --> 00:51:17.874
MONTHS.

00:51:17.941 --> 00:51:19.509
HOMELESSNESS IS INCREASED.

00:51:19.576 --> 00:51:21.645
BY ALMOST 20% ACROSS THE STATE

00:51:21.711 --> 00:51:23.914
OF CALIFORNIA IN THE LAST YEAR.

00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:26.016
SO I THINK IT'S KNOWS SECRET TO

00:51:26.082 --> 00:51:27.451
THE PEOPLE THIS CHAMBER BUT THE

00:51:27.517 --> 00:51:29.386
PROBLEM HOMELESS NEXT IS COMPLEX

00:51:29.453 --> 00:51:31.555
AND MULTIFACETED IT'S FAR BEYOND

00:51:31.621 --> 00:51:32.923
THE FACT THAT PEOPLE DON'T HAVE

00:51:32.989 --> 00:51:34.090
HOUSES.

00:51:34.157 --> 00:51:36.126
IT HAS ITS ROOTS AND THINGS LIKE

00:51:36.193 --> 00:51:37.461
MENTAL ILLNESS.

00:51:37.527 --> 00:51:39.062
I IN SUBSTANCE ABUSE.

00:51:39.129 --> 00:51:41.398
I HAD IN THE DECLINING FORTUNES

00:51:41.465 --> 00:51:42.799
OF THE MIDDLE CLASS.

00:51:42.866 --> 00:51:44.968
BUT TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IS

00:51:45.035 --> 00:51:46.503
GOING TO REQUIRE HOLISTIC

00:51:46.570 --> 00:51:47.804
APPROACHES TO SOLVING THE

00:51:47.871 --> 00:51:49.706
UNDERLYING PROBLEMS OF WHY

00:51:49.773 --> 00:51:52.108
PEOPLE ARE HOMELESS AND UNTIL.

00:51:52.175 --> 00:51:52.676
WE ARE WILLING TO TAKE THOSE

00:51:52.742 --> 00:51:53.376
STEPS.

00:51:53.443 --> 00:51:54.544
NEARLY THROWING MONEY AT THIS

00:51:54.611 --> 00:51:57.347
PROBLEM IS NOT GOING TO SOLVE IT.

00:51:57.414 --> 00:51:59.282
HOWEVER IF THIS IS THE BEST WE

00:51:59.349 --> 00:52:00.750
CAN DO OF THIS YEAR MY ORIGINAL

00:52:26.743 --> 00:52:28.745
INTENSE HOUSING CRISIS THAT WE

00:52:28.812 --> 00:52:29.379
HAVE EXPERIENCE IN OUR STATE'S

00:52:29.446 --> 00:52:31.214

00:53:15.058 --> 00:53:16.493
HOUSING ELEMENT COMPLIANCE

THROUGH INCENTIVES FIRST BEFORE

I'M ESPECIALLY HAPPY THE SMALL

INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM.

00:53:31.775 --> 00:53:33.009
BECAUSE RURAL AND SMALL

00:53:33.076 --> 00:53:34.144
COMMUNITIES FACE DIFFERENT

00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:35.579
CHALLENGES IN ATTRACTING AND

I ALSO APPRECIATE THE LANGUAGE

00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:52.429
THAT ALLOWS THE COURT TO

00:53:52.495 --> 00:53:53.563
CONSIDER MITIGATING

00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:55.699
CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHY A CITY OR

00:53:55.765 --> 00:53:58.902
COUNTY MAY BE OUT OF COMPLIANCE.

00:53:58.969 --> 00:54:00.537
OUR TENDENCY IS TO LUMP LOCALS

00:54:00.604 --> 00:54:01.905
WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO ATTRACT

00:54:01.972 --> 00:54:03.573

00:54:31.234 --> 00:54:32.435
IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I WANT

00:54:32.502 --> 00:54:35.305
TO NOTE SOME OF THE PROVISIONS I

00:54:35.372 --> 00:54:36.873
THINK ARE OF SPECIALLY IMPORTERS.

00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:38.308
SIGNIFICAN HERE.

00:54:38.375 --> 00:54:40.143
WE ESTABLISHED POLICY HERE SET

00:54:43.213 --> 00:54:45.115

00:54:45.181 --> 00:54:46.483
FISH THERE SHALL BE CRITERIA

00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:48.551
THAT CONSIDER THE NEEDS OF RURAL

00:54:48.618 --> 00:54:50.120
SUBURBAN URBAN JURISDICTIONS.

00:54:50.186 --> 00:54:51.421
AND THE FACT THAT THESE

00:54:51.488 --> 00:54:53.223
JURISDICTIONS MAY DIFFER.

00:54:53.289 --> 00:54:54.824
SO WE THE LEGISLATURE TELL THE

00:54:54.891 --> 00:54:56.192
ADMINISTRATION THE HOUSING

00:54:56.259 --> 00:54:59.496

00:54:59.562 --> 00:55:01.331
TO A DOLLAR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

00:55:01.398 --> 00:55:02.766
JURISDICTIONS THAT'S ACTUALLY

00:55:02.832 --> 00:55:04.367
BASIC FAIRNESS.

00:55:04.434 --> 00:55:06.603
WE DIDN'T GO ON AND GRANTS TO

00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:08.672
THIS AGENCY.

00:55:08.738 --> 00:55:10.106
THAT'S THE FRAMEWORK THE HONOR

00:55:10.173 --> 00:55:11.174
DOLLARS HE'S DIFFERENCES BUT

00:55:11.241 --> 00:55:13.143
THEN THEY CREATE THE LIST OF

00:55:13.209 --> 00:55:14.744
WHICH ARE PRO HOUSING

00:55:14.811 --> 00:55:15.879
JURISDICTIONS.

00:55:15.945 --> 00:55:16.846
SO WE SAID NO ONE HAD

00:55:16.913 --> 00:55:18.782
LEGISLATURE HAVE A BALANCED

00:55:18.848 --> 00:55:19.949
APPROACH.

00:55:20.016 --> 00:55:20.884
BUT WE DIDN'T DO GRANT THE

00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:22.085

I JUST WANT TO SAY ON BEHALF OF

THE STATE'S CITIES.

00:55:29.359 --> 00:55:30.860
THE FAIRNESS OF HOW THAT LIST

00:55:30.927 --> 00:55:32.629
GETS CREATED MAINTAINED THAT IT

00:55:32.696 --> 00:55:33.863
DOES REFLECT THIS LIFESAVING

00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:35.398
TEND TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN

00:55:35.465 --> 00:55:37.100

DETRACTORS WERE LANDING TODAY ON

01:08:16.125 --> 01:08:17.927
THE GREENHOUSE GAS.

01:08:17.993 --> 01:08:21.797
FUND -- IT'S AN OPTION FRANKLY

01:08:21.864 --> 01:08:24.934
NOT MY FIRST CHOICE.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.603
BUT IN MY OPINION GOING FORWARD.

01:08:27.670 --> 01:08:29.171
WE SHOULD BE USING THE

01:08:29.238 --> 01:08:32.508
GREENHOUSE GAS FUND.

01:08:32.575 --> 01:08:34.844
IN WAYS THAT MORE FULLY ALIGNED

01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:36.512
WITH THE GOALS OF THAT FUND AND

01:08:36.579 --> 01:08:38.047
I HOPE THAT EVENTUALLY WILL BE

01:08:38.113 --> 01:08:39.615
ABLE TO OUGHT TO FIND AN

01:08:39.682 --> 01:08:40.983
ALTERNATIVE SOURCE.

01:08:41.050 --> 01:08:43.385
BUT FOR NOW THIS IS THE BEST

01:08:43.452 --> 01:08:46.188
SOLUTION THAT WE HAVE AN SP TWO

01:08:46.255 --> 01:08:47.756
HUNDRED OFFERS US A GREAT START

01:08:47.823 --> 01:08:49.959
ON RESTORING SAFE DRINKING WATER

01:08:50.025 --> 01:08:50.726
THE WANT TO THOSE.

01:08:50.793 --> 01:08:52.628
MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO DO NOT

01:08:52.695 --> 01:08:54.463
HAVE ACCESS IT LAYS THE

01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:56.999
FOUNDATION FOR A LONG TERM

01:08:57.066 --> 01:08:58.200
EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT ALL

01:08:58.267 --> 01:09:00.302
CALIFORNIANS HAVE SAFE DRINKING

01:09:00.369 --> 01:09:02.338
WATER.

01:09:02.404 --> 01:09:03.639
SB TWO HUNDRED CREATES.

01:09:03.706 --> 01:09:05.241
THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING

01:09:05.307 --> 01:09:07.576
WATER FUNDED IT AUTHORIZES THE

01:09:07.643 --> 01:09:10.012
PURPOSES FOR THE USE OF THE FUND

01:09:10.079 --> 01:09:12.314
REQUIRES AN EXPENDITURE PLAN.

01:09:12.381 --> 01:09:13.749
BUT IT'S JUST A START.

01:09:13.816 --> 01:09:15.551
SB TWO HUNDRED PROVIDES THE

01:09:15.618 --> 01:09:18.120
FOUNDATION BUT NOT THE STRUCTURE

01:09:18.187 --> 01:09:20.589
AS THE FLOOR ANALYSIS NOTES IT

01:09:20.656 --> 01:09:22.291
DOES NOT PROVIDE THE PROGRAM AND

01:09:22.358 --> 01:09:23.759
PRIORITIES FOR HOW THE STATE

01:09:23.826 --> 01:09:25.327
WATER BOARD WILL RESTORE SAFE

01:09:25.394 --> 01:09:26.929
DRINKING WATER.

01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:28.464
AND IN THE YEAR AHEAD.

01:09:28.531 --> 01:09:29.965
WE WILL STILL NEED TO SET THOSE

01:09:30.032 --> 01:09:31.534
PRIORITIES GIVE THE BOARD

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:33.168
DIRECTION AND PROVIDE THE

01:09:33.235 --> 01:09:34.803
FRAMEWORK FOR HOW THE BOARD

01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:36.839
MOVES FORWARD TO OUR WORK IS NOT

01:09:36.906 --> 01:09:37.540
DONE.

01:09:37.606 --> 01:09:39.575
IN RECENT YEARS THE BOARD IS

01:09:39.642 --> 01:09:41.343
HIRED PRIVATE CONSULTANTS ARE

01:09:41.410 --> 01:09:43.412
NON PROFITS TO HELP INDIVIDUAL

01:09:43.479 --> 01:09:45.047
WATER SYSTEMS IN SOME RURAL

01:09:45.114 --> 01:09:46.115
COMMUNITIES.

01:09:46.181 --> 01:09:47.816
AND WHILE IT IS HAD ACCESS TO

01:09:47.883 --> 01:09:50.152
WATER BOND FUNDS FOR FUNDS FOR

01:09:50.219 --> 01:09:52.021
CAPITAL PROJECTS LIKE TREATMENT

01:09:52.087 --> 01:09:54.189
PLANTS IT IS HAD LIMITED FUNDING

01:09:54.256 --> 01:09:55.591
FOR SOFT COSTS.

01:09:55.658 --> 01:09:57.726
AND COULD ONLY DO SO MUCH SO NOW

01:09:57.793 --> 01:09:59.728
SB TWO HUNDRED IN THE STATE

01:09:59.795 --> 01:10:00.195
BUDGET.

01:10:00.262 --> 01:10:02.565
INJECTS A SUBSTANTIAL INFUSION

01:10:02.631 --> 01:10:03.899
OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION

01:10:03.966 --> 01:10:06.335
DOLLARS EACH AND EVERY YEAR.

01:10:06.402 --> 01:10:08.537
THIS BILL CHANGES THE EQUATION

01:10:08.604 --> 01:10:10.539
AND WILL DEMAND THAT THE STATE

01:10:10.606 --> 01:10:12.041
BOARD SUBSTANTIALLY RAMP UP ITS

01:10:12.107 --> 01:10:14.543
EFFORTS TO GET SAFE DRINKING

01:10:14.610 --> 01:10:16.845
WATER TO ALL CALIFORNIANS.

01:10:16.912 --> 01:10:17.479
HOW IS THE BOARD GOING TO SCALE

01:10:17.546 --> 01:10:19.315
UP WELL THE BILL DOES NOT GIVE

01:10:19.381 --> 01:10:20.950
THE BOARD NEW AUTHORITY OR

01:10:21.016 --> 01:10:22.418
DIRECTION ON HOW TO SCALE UP?

01:10:22.484 --> 01:10:23.886
AND I THINK ONE PART OF THE

01:10:23.953 --> 01:10:25.554
ANSWER IS ENGAGING ALL

01:10:25.621 --> 01:10:27.756
STAKEHOLDERS PARTICULARLY

01:10:27.823 --> 01:10:29.491
SUCCESSFUL WATER AGENCIES THAT

01:10:29.558 --> 01:10:31.927
HAVE EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE.

01:10:31.994 --> 01:10:33.963
TO SET FAILING WATER SYSTEMS ON

01:10:34.029 --> 01:10:36.332
A NEW SUSTAINABLE PATH WE NEED

01:10:36.398 --> 01:10:38.067
ALL HANDS ON DECK APPROACH. TO

01:10:38.133 --> 01:10:40.402
SAFE TO THE SAFE DRINKING WATER

01:10:40.469 --> 01:10:40.869
EMERGENCY THAT WE'RE

01:10:40.936 --> 01:10:44.406
EXPERIENCING SO NEXT YEAR AB ONE

01:10:44.473 --> 01:10:45.774
THIRTY FOUR WILL DO EXACTLY THAT

01:10:45.841 --> 01:10:47.843
AND ENGAGE ALL STAKEHOLDERS AND

01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:49.311
THE LEGISLATURE.

01:10:49.378 --> 01:10:51.280
IN HOW THE BOARD CAN DO THAT

01:10:51.347 --> 01:10:53.349
SCALING SETTING PRIORITIES AND

01:10:53.415 --> 01:10:54.516
SETTING DIRECTION AND GIVING THE

01:10:54.583 --> 01:10:56.318
BOARD AUTHORITY THE AUTHORITY

01:10:56.385 --> 01:10:57.820
THAT IT NEEDS TO SUCCEED.

01:10:57.886 --> 01:10:59.989
SO THE CALIFORNIA CAN OVERCOME

01:11:00.055 --> 01:11:01.457
IT SAFE DRINKING WATER

01:11:01.523 --> 01:11:03.759
CHALLENGES.

01:11:03.826 --> 01:11:05.494
SB TO HUNDRED IS A CRITICAL

01:11:05.561 --> 01:11:09.765
FIRST STEP I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE.

01:11:15.704 --> 01:11:17.406
THANK YOU.

01:11:17.473 --> 01:11:18.507
COLLEAGUES I RISE IN SUPPORT OF

01:11:18.574 --> 01:11:20.409
SB TWO HUNDRED ONE MILLION

01:11:20.476 --> 01:11:22.177
CALIFORNIANS ARE LIVING WITHOUT

01:11:22.244 --> 01:11:23.946
SAFE WATER THAT THEY CAN DEPEND

01:11:24.013 --> 01:11:26.715
ON IN MANY CASES THIS IS BECAUSE

01:11:26.782 --> 01:11:28.183
OF CONTAMINATION.

01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:30.352
IT IS MY CONVICTION THAT

01:11:30.419 --> 01:11:32.121
POLLUTERS MUST PAY.

01:11:32.187 --> 01:11:33.489
I AM PROUD OF CALIFORNIA'S

01:11:33.555 --> 01:11:35.190
ECONOMIC SUCCESS BUT IT IS

01:11:35.257 --> 01:11:37.059
MEANINGLESS IF IT IS ON THE

01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:38.193
BACKS OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:39.361
OF PEOPLE.

01:11:39.428 --> 01:11:40.829
LIVING IN RURAL AND URBAN

01:11:40.896 --> 01:11:42.197
COMMUNITIES WITH CONTAMINATED

01:11:42.264 --> 01:11:44.133
WATER.

01:11:44.199 --> 01:11:45.501
THOSE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE

01:11:45.567 --> 01:11:47.603
ESPECIALLY LARGE AND IMPORTANT%

01:11:47.670 --> 01:11:49.471
AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS MUST

01:11:49.538 --> 01:11:50.606
STEP UP.

01:11:50.673 --> 01:11:52.908
AND ACCEPT THAT RESPONSIBILITY.

01:11:52.975 --> 01:11:55.344
WE AS A STATE MUST ENSURE THAT

01:11:55.411 --> 01:11:56.745
THAT HAPPENS.

01:11:56.812 --> 01:11:58.180
WE WILL CONTINUE TO HOLD THEM

01:11:58.247 --> 01:11:59.048
ACCOUNTABLE BUT THAT IS NOT

01:11:59.114 --> 01:12:00.916
ENOUGH.

01:12:00.983 --> 01:12:02.685
EVEN AS WE PURSUE ACCOUNTABILITY

01:12:02.751 --> 01:12:04.553
WE MUST ENSURE THAT PEOPLE CAN

01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:06.088
TURN ON THEIR TAPS.

01:12:06.155 --> 01:12:07.756
AND NOT WORRY ABOUT THE GLASSES

01:12:07.823 --> 01:12:08.824
OF WATER THEY GET FOR THEIR

01:12:08.891 --> 01:12:10.426
CHILDREN.

01:12:10.492 --> 01:12:11.960
THIS IS WHAT WE ARE DOING TODAY

01:12:12.027 --> 01:12:13.696
WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE

01:12:13.762 --> 01:12:15.297

01:12:15.364 --> 01:12:17.132
WATER FUND.

01:12:17.199 --> 01:12:18.667
IT IS A WAY FOR CALIFORNIA TO

01:12:18.734 --> 01:12:20.636
CONTINUE TO BE A PIONEER FOR

01:12:20.703 --> 01:12:22.337
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE.

01:12:22.404 --> 01:12:24.540
IN SUCH A PROSPEROUS STATE IT IS

01:12:24.606 --> 01:12:26.341
AN EMBARRASSMENT TO HAVE PEOPLE

01:12:26.408 --> 01:12:28.377
WHO CANNOT GET CLEAN WATER.

01:12:28.444 --> 01:12:30.245
BECAUSE IT COSTS TOO MUCH.

01:12:30.312 --> 01:12:31.647
THIS IS HOW WE CAN PUT THAT

01:12:31.714 --> 01:12:33.782
EMBARRASSMENT BEHIND US.

01:12:33.849 --> 01:12:35.484
