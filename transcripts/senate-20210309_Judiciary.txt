WE HAVE TO GO AND FILE ORDER SO SENATE CABALLERO- IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT SB TWENTY FOUR THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR- HELLO MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATORS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT SB TWENTY FOUR WHICH MAKES REVISIONS TO THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER FORM TO PROTECT A CHILD'S SCHOOL MEDICAL AND DENTAL INFORMATION FROM AN ABUSIVE PARENT. THIS BILL REQUIRES THIRD PARTY INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS SCHOOLS AND OFFICES AND MEDICAL OFFICES TO DEVELOP PROTOCOLS WHEN THEY RECEIVE A COPY OF SUCH A COURT RESTRAINING ORDER I WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT I'VE AGREED TO STRIKE THE IMMUNITY PROVISIONS FROM THE BILL. I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASE THAT WAS THE CATALYST FOR SB TWENTY FOUR BEGINS WITH A YOUNG MOTHER KELLY WHO LIVED IN MAJOR WITH THEIR THREE YOUNG BOYS ALL AGED UNDER SIX KELLY LEFT HER HUSBAND IN MAY OF LAST YEAR AFTER YEARS OF PHYSICAL. BRUTAL PHYSICAL EMOTIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL ABUSE BECAUSE OF THE EMOTIONAL ABUSE HE WAS ISOLATED FROM HER FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND WAS AFRAID FOR THE SAFETY OF OUR YOUNG BOYS AND BELIEVED THAT NO ONE WOULD HELP HER. WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SUPPORT SHELTER SHE OBTAINED A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER AND WENT INTO HIDING WITH HER CHILDREN. AND CONTACTED HER FAMILY FOR HELP. AT SUCCESSFUL HIDING HER HUSBAND FOR THREE MONTHS AND GETTING HELP FOR HER AND HER BOYS. KELLY MADE AN APPOINTMENT AT A LOCAL HEALTH CLINIC. THE CLINIC CALL TO CONFIRM THE APPOINTMENT AND CALLED KELLY'S HUSBAND CELL PHONE. SO THAT HE INADVERTENTLY LEARNED AT THE TIME AND THE LOCATION OF THE IMPORT OF THE APPOINTMENT. ON JULY FOURTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY CALLIE'S ESTRANGED AND VIOLENT HUSBAND. DROVE TO THE CLINIC WAITED FOR KELLY IN THE PARKING LOT AND WHEN SHE ARRIVED. HE SHOT AND KILLED HER IN BROAD DAYLIGHT AS SHE SHIELDED THEIR THREE YOUNG CHILDREN FROM THE BULLETS. I BRING KELLY STORY TO YOUR ATTENTION BECAUSE IN THE REALM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THIS LEVEL OF CONTROL. PLANNING AND PERPETUAL VIOLENCE IS UNFORTUNATELY UNFORTUNATELY NOT AN UNCOMMON OCCURRENCE IT IS PROJECTED THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HAS RAVAGED OUR COMMUNITIES AT EVEN HIGHER RATES SINCE THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC. PARTICULARLY SINCE THE STAY AT HOME ORDER WAS ISSUED. FOR THOSE IN AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP THE RISKS THEY FEET FACE AND LEAVING THEIR PARTNER MAY BE JUST AS DANGEROUS AS THE RISK OF STAYING PUT. UP 270% SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT. OF ABUSED WOMEN WHO ARE MURDERED OR KILLED AFTER THEY LEAVE TEIR PARTNER'S. VIOLENT PERPETRATORS TO MURDER THEIR EX PARTNERS GO TO GREAT LENGTHS TO TRACK THEIR VICTIMS ONE STRATEGY UTILIZED BY ABUSIVE PARTNERS. IT'S TRUE IS TO TRACK THE LOCATION OF THE SHARED CHILDREN. THIS IS WHY A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER IS VITAL TO SURVIVORS. THESE PROTECTIVE ORDERS REQUIRED THE PERPETRATOR TO REFRAIN FROM HAVING ANY CONTACT WITH THE VICTIMS. AND THEIR CHILDREN. CURRENTLY A JUDGE CAN GRANT A MULTITUDE OF DIFFERENT PROTECTIONS FOR THE ABUSED PARTY IN A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER. INCLUDING ORDERS THAT PROTECT THE MEDICAL AND SCHOOL INFORMATION OF THE SHARED CHILDREN. HOWEVER WHILE A JUDGE HAS THIS DISCUSSION ALREADY. A JUDGE CANNOT SELECT THIS PROTECTION ON THE ACTUAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER FORM. THEREFORE WHEN A PROTECTIVE ORDER IS PRINTED AND GIVEN TO THE PARTIES INVOLVED IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY SAY. THAT SCHOOL- MEDICAL- DE AND- ABOUT THE SHARED CHILDREN BE PROTECTED FROM THE PERPETRATOR. THIS MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR A SCHOOL OR MEDICAL OFFICE TO ENFORCE IF THERE IS NO CLEAR LANGUAGE STATING OTHERWISE THEN THE THIRTY PARTY THIRD PARTY INSTITUTIONS WILL NOT DENY A PARENT THE LEGAL RIGHT TO INFORMATION ABOUT THE CHILD. SB TWENTY FOUR REQUIRES THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO EDIT THE CURRENT RESTRAINING ORDER FORM SO THAT PROTECTIVE ORDERS WILL CLEARLY STATE WHETHER OR NOT A JUDGE HAS ISSUED THIS PROTECTION. THAT WAY THIRTY THIRD PARTY INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS SCHOOLS AND MEDICAL OFFICES WILL HAVE NO LEGAL HAS ENDED C. IN COMPLYING AND SENSITIVE INFORMATION WILL NOT BE MADE AVAILABLE TO PERPETRATORS PROTECTING THE PRIVACY AND SECURITY OF THE VICTIM. AND MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO TRACK THEM. WE HAVE TO OFFER MORE PROTECTIONS FOR PEOPLE LIKE KELLY. LIKE SB TWENTY FOUR DOES. THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE WITH ME TODAY IS SERRA RODRIGUEZ KELLY'S COUSIN WHO WOULD LIKE TO SEE A FEW WORDS AND ALISON KEPT PART FROM WE'VE WHO IS HERE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS A COMMITTEE MAY HAVE.

THAT THE COLD MENTAL EMOTIONAL BEHAVIOR CALIFORNIA REACHED OUT FOR HELP. HONESTLY I THAT COURAGE CAME FROM BEING A MOM. HER VIEWS- HAVE BROKERS SO FAR BUT I THINK BEING A MOM GAVE HER JUST A LITTLE. AS THE IN TO SLEEP. WHEN WE HELPED HER ESCAPE ON MAY FIFTEENTH SHE WAS ALMOST UNRECOGNIZABLE SHE WOULD MAKE EYE CONTACT SHE WOULDN'T HARDLY SPEAK UNLESS YOU AFTER SOMETHING AND EVEN THEN SHE HAD NO OPINION AND MADE NO COMPLAINT BUDGET COLLEGE EYES FOR ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING BUT WHEN SHE INTERACTED WITH HER VOICE YOU COULD SEE HER STILL IN THERE WE STAYED WITH THEM FOR A MONTH AT A HOTEL AND JUST LISTENING TO THE HORRIFIC STORIES OF THINGS. SHE HAD HE HAD DONE AND THINGS YOU'LL ONLY SEE ON TV SHE WAS TOLD EVERY DAY HER ONLY PURPOSE BUT TO SERVE HIM BY TELLING YOU THAT WASN'T TRUE SHE KNEW HER PURPOSE WAS TO PROTECT YOUR CHILDREN KELLY SAID HER BIGGEST FEAR. AND WHAT MADE HER FINELY WAS THAT IF SHE DIDN'T HE WOULD KILL THEM ALL SHE WANTED TO END THE CYCLE OF ABUSE SHE LOVED HER CHILDREN AND DID NOT WANT. TO EVER BE A CHANCE THAT THEY WILL GROW UP TO BE ANYTHING LIKE HIM SHE WANTED HER CHILDREN TO KNOW WHEN TO LET THE FAMILY WOULD LIKE AND WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE A CAN. THE LONGER SHE WAS FREE. THE MORE SHE WAS WRECKED. AGAIN BOB JUST. BUT SHE COULD WRECK. OR SO AGAIN. SHE COULD BE. YOU CAN SEE HER FIGHTING TO BE FREE. SHE SMILED SHE LAUGHS SHE WAS PLANNING A FUTURE FOR HER AND HER KIDS WITH HER FAMILY. THE PEOPLE SHE LOVES AND THE PEOPLE WHO LOVE THEM. SHE WAS. ABLE TO FINALLY TELL HER TRUTH. IN AGING HEALING SHE WAS SO AMAZING AND FULL LIFE AGAIN. SHE WAS STAYING IN A WOMEN'S SHELTER AND FILL HIM SHE WAS EXTREMELY CAREFUL EVEN GOING TO COURT HAD TO BE DONE WITH CAUTION IN CERTAIN DAYS TO PREPARE FOR. JUST A- ON JULY FOURTEEN TWENTY TWENTY KELLY HAD AN APPOINTMENT AT YOUR ARENA HELP. WHERE AN EMPLOYEE HAD TOLD HER STRANGE HUSBAND OF HER APPOINTMENT. HE WAITED FOR HER AS SHE EXITED THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE. IN ANY AT THE SHELTERS BANNED. UNDER DOWN IN THE LAST MOMENT. WITHOUT A THOUGHT SHE PICKED UP ONE OF HER SON. YOUR HAND IN THE VAN AND USED HER BODY TO PROTECT THE LIVES OF OUR CHILDREN. MUNSTER TOOK HER FROM US JUST AS WE GOT HER BACK.

STERN I WHITE HOUSE GABILEY WHY CASKEY I WIENER. ONE NINE BILL THE BILL IS OUT NOW THE NINETEEN YEAR OLD. THE NINE ZERO IS THE VOTE WE'RE GONNA HOLD THE ROLE OPEN HERE- UNTIL THE CONCLUSION OF THE HEARING. ALL RIGHT- NEXT I'M GOING TO HAND THE VIRTUAL GAVEL OVER TO SENATOR BOARD JUST- FOR PURPOSES OF ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT MY BILL AND- DIFFERENT THAN TYPICAL PROTOCOL ON THE PRESENT FROM HERE IN THE ROSTER AND THE ROSTER. IT WOULD- MISTER CHAIR WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO ACTUALLY GET THE GAVEL. THIS VIRTUAL GALLAGHER IS NOT COOL THIS REPORT IS WILL ALLOW FOR PHOTO OPPORTUNITIES AFTERWARDS. ALL RIGHTS. WELCOME SAID ROMBERG ARE YOU ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS AS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS ON PAGE TEN COMMENT THREE YES WE ACCEPT AMENDMENTS THANK YOU SENATOR- PLEASE PRESENT YOUR BILL SB FORTY ONE THANK YOU OF MISTER CHAIR IN MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK- CHRISTIAN COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL THIS BILL IS NEARLY IDENTICAL TO A BILL THAT WAS PRESENTED LAST YEAR CONCERNING GENETIC INFORMATION AND CONSUMER PRIVACY THIS BILL WOULD STRENGTHEN CONSUMERS CONTROL OVER THEIR GENETIC MATERIAL WHEN THEY PROVIDED TO A DIRECT TO CONSUMER TESTING COMPANY- MANY OF YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH- WHEN YOU PROVIDE A SALIVA SAMPLE TO A COMPANY. THEY DO ANALYSIS IN THE REPORT BACK TO YOU FOR EXAMPLE IS TO YOUR ANCESTRY MAYBE SOME OTHER ISSUES- CONCERNING HEALTH IN THE LIKE A CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW ALLOWS CONSUMERS TO PROVIDE GENETIC SAMPLES TO DIRECT TO CONSUMER GENETIC TESTING COMPANIES TO REQUEST INFORMATION REGARDING HOW THEIR SAMPLES ARE BEING USED ALLOWS THEM TO OPT OUT THIS REQUIRES CONSUMERS TO KNOW ASK FOR THE INFORMATION AND UNDERSTAND SOMETIMES CONFUSING CONSENT FORMS. OF THIS BILL WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THIS ISSUES BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION BY A DIRECTIVE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TELLING SERVICE MEMBERS NOT TO SUBMIT THEIR SAMPLES BECAUSE THEY MIGHT BE USED FOR NEFARIOUS PURPOSES BY OTHER- OTHER ADVERSARIES OF THE UNITED STATES WHAT SB FORTY ONE REQUIRES THESE COMPANIES PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW GENETIC SAMPLES ARE COLLECTED USED AND DISCLOSED. TO EVERY CONSUMER IN A CLEAR UNDERSTANDABLE FASHION ALSO REQUIRES THE COMPANIES TO OBTAIN A CONSUMERS EXPRESS INFORMED CONSENT BEFORE COLLECTING OR USING THEIR GENETIC SAMPLES. BEFORE STORING IT AFTER TESTING THE CONSUMER AND ALSO BEFORE TRANSFERRING DISCLOSING THAT SAMPLE TO A THIRD PARTY- WE'RE WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO ENSURE THAT THIS DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH COLD IT TESTING. PUBLIC TESTING TESTS RNA NOT DNA BUT THERE WERE CONCERNS THAT THAT THERE MAY BE SOME. OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS BILL FOR PURPOSES OF. COLLECTING A COVERT NINETEEN TESTING SAMPLES WERE WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THOSE ISSUES ARE RESOLVED- THIS BILL SUPPORTED BY CONSUMER AND PRIVACY ADVOCATES RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS AND LEADERS. WITHIN THE GENETIC TESTING INDUSTRY. PASSING IT WILL CODIFY BEST PRACTICES AND GIVE CALIFORNIANS THE CONFIDENCE THAT THEY PROVIDE. WHEN THEY PROVIDE GENETIC DATA I SHOULD ADD THAT THAT MOST COMPANIES ACTUALLY ARE OPERATING IN A VERY ETHICAL WAY. SOME ARE NOT AND THUS THE NEED FOR THE BILL- TODAY I HAVE MISS MARIE MAHONEY WITH CONSUMER REPORTS. I'M HOPEFUL THAT SHE IS ON THE LINE TO TESTIFY. YEAH. MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY MY NAME IS MAUREEN MAHONEY AND I'M A POLICY ANALYST AT CONSUMER REPORTS AND WE'RE PROBABLY SUPPORTING SB FORTY ONE IT WOULD PROVIDE IMPORTANT PRIVACY PROTECTIONS FOR UNIQUELY SENSE THE GENETIC DATA THIS DATA CAN PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO WHETHER YOU OR A FAMILY MEMBER IS VULNERABLE TO CERTAIN DISEASES AND CONSUMERS STRONGLY VALUE PROTECTIONS OVER IT OVER SIXTY THOUSAND CONSUMERS HAVE SIGNED A PETITION CALLING ON LAWMAKERS TO ENSURE THAT THIS DATA IS KEPT. PRIVATE AND SECURE. MILLIONS OF CONSUMERS HAVE UC'S TEST TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL HEALTH ISSUES AND MANY LIKELY SOON THE STATE- IT'S COVERED BY HYPOCRISY MY AGE. WHICH REQUIRE CONSENT FROM A DISCLOSURE. IN CONTRAST THE DATA COLLECTED BY DIRECT TO CONSUMER TESTING COMPANIES IS PROTECTED CHIEFLY BY CITY PA WHICH PROTECTS. WHICH PLACES NEXT TO NO RESTRICTIONS ON SECONDARY USE OF DATA AND THE CCP IS RELATIVELY LIMITED ABOUT THE SALE PROVISION MEANS THAT BY DEFAULT COMPANIES COULD LEGALLY SHARE THIS DATA WITH THIRD PARTIES. BUT STILL REQUIRED CONSENT FOR THE COLLECTION SECONDARY USES AND DISCLOSURE OF THE STATE ARE AND HOW THE PROVISION TO REVOKE CONSENT AS WELL PUTTING CONSUMERS SQUARELY IN CONTROL. FOR ME IT HAS A STRONG DEFINITION OF CONSENT TO MAKE SURE THAT CONSUMERS KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GETTING INTO AND HAVE A REAL CHOICE OVER HOW THIS DATA. CAN BE USED. ALSO AT THE DATA SECURITY REQUIREMENTS HELP ENSURE. THE DATA IS PROTECTED FROM UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS. IN LIGHT OF SECURITY BREACHES AT GENETIC TESTING COMPANIES IN RECENT YEARS ALREADY STATES LIKE ILLINOIS AND MISSOURI HAVE ROBUST PROTECTIONS OVER THE STATE AT THIS TIME THE CALIFORNIANS HAVE STRONG PRIVACY PROTECTIONS AS WELL WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. YOU MARIE MAHONEY FOR THAT NOW LET'S BEGIN WITH ANY WITNESSES HERE IN THE SENATE GALLERY. SEEING NONE. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN ROOM ONE TWELVE WE SHOULD TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF S. B. FOUR ONE.

WE DO HAVE CONCERNS RELATE TO HOW THIS BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM IMPACT HELPING MAKING TESTING. SB THIRTY WILL. MAYBE TRYING TO CONSEQUENCES IT RELATES TO THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION. THE GENETIC INFORMATION AS YOU CAN SAM COOKE IN NINETEEN TASK. THEY OFTEN COMPLAIN OF THE BILL COULD INTERFERE WITH THE LABORATORIES REQUIREMENTS REPORT COVER NINETEEN FAST AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. PLEASE SHARE THIS INFORMATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THIS CAPTURE THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE IN LAST YEAR'S VERSION THE BILL THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. BUT A CRITICAL TO CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE TO THE COMPANY TO PANDEMIC AND WE CANNOT AFFORD TO UNINTENTIONALLY IMPEDE THAT AFTER. INITIALLY WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE GENETIC DATA DEFINITION THE BILL WHICH WILL PUT IN SCOPE INFORMATION. THE DEFINITION IS BROAD ENOUGH THAT IT WOULD EVEN INCLUDE AN EMPLOYEE. IT ALSO INCLUDES THE RESULTS OF THEIR AT HOME TASK CORPORATE OR OTHERWISE AND WE HAVE SPOKEN WITH DOCTORS STAFF AND WE'RE CONFIDENT THESE ISSUES WILL BE RESOLVED WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE AMENDMENTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH.

ALL RIGHTS THANK YOU TO ALL OF OUR SUPPORT OPPOSITION WITNESSES- WE'RE GONNA BRING DISCUSSION BACK TO- MEMBERS- COLLEAGUES- DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS- OUT OF THE GATE IS- CENTER HERTZBERG. VERY MUCH I WANT TO QUESTION IS THE- AUTHOR WITH RESPECT TO THIS ISSUE OF DARK PATTERNS. I WAS NOT HERE TO- EXCEPT TO QUESTION WHEN POSED YES. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN STROTHER. AS YOU WELL KNOW- THIS DEFINITION OF DARK PATTERNS IS NOT DEFINED IN CCPA BUT- IS INCLUDED I SUSPECT FROM YOUR RESEARCH THAT YOU ARE SO CHARACTERISTIC OF DOING IN PROPOSITION TWENTY FOUR. AND AS FAR AS I KNOW THERE'S NO OTHER LEGISLATION IN THE COUNTRY THAT EVEN DEALS WITH THIS ISSUE OF DARK PATTERNS START PATTERNS IS BASICALLY THE WAY THAT YOU TREAT PEOPLE TO- TO GET CONSENT WHEN THEY REALLY AREN'T ENGAGING CONSENSUS JUST WANTED TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS WITH RESPECT TO. BY THE THINKING ON THAT THIS REFERENCED IN THE IN THE ANALYSIS AND SECONDLY A WHILE LATER IN SPRING IF YOU ACCEPT THIS ALSO I KNOW SOME REFERENCE BUT I OBVIOUSLY THE GOVERNOR VETOED THIS LAST TIME. AND I WANTED TO GET YOUR INSIGHTS AS TO WHY THIS TIME YOU THINK THAT THIS MEASURE WILL BE SIGNED CERTAINLY IS OUR RIGHT AS THE LEGISLATURE TO PUT THESE MATTERS FOR THE GOVERNOR AND THE CAN BE DONE EVERY TIME THEY WANT TO THAT'S THE SEPARATION OF POWERS BUT JUST WANT TO GET YOUR INSIGHT. ON THAT SECOND QUESTION AS WELL AS TREND- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF. THEN HERTZBERG CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU ON ALL YOUR WORK ON PRIVACY- WITH RESPECT TO DARK PATTERNS IN PARTICULAR- YOU YOU ARE PROBABLY THE EXPERT HERE ON THE FLOOR WITH RESPECT TO DARK PATTERNS- AND MANY OF US HAVE EXPERIENCED WHERE YOU ARE ONLINE AND YOU SEE SOMETHING THAT IS CONFUSING ASKING FOR YOUR CONSENT TO DO SOMETHING THAT YOU MAY NOT WANT TO DO IF YOU HAD A FULL KNOWLEDGE AND THAT THAT. DEFINITION OF DARK PATTERNS IS TAKEN FROM PROPOSITION TWENTY FOUR- AND SO WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT THAT. WILL BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT IN THE INDUSTRY TO BE ABLE TO EXECUTE THE WAY THAT ELIMINATES THAT. SORT OF INTENTIONAL CONFUSION THAT'S ITEM NUMBER ONE ITEM NUMBER TWO YES THE GOVERNOR DID DID VETO THE BILL LAST YEAR- IN HIS VETO MESSAGE HE EXPRESSED CONCERNS OF SUCH AS THE FOLKS AT TECHNET EXPRESS CONCERNING. KOVIN TESTING AGAIN. IN COVERT TESTING YOU'RE LOOKING AT A DIFFERENT SEQUENCE TO LOOK AT A DIFFERENT ITEM RNA VERSUS DNA. OUT WE ARE WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T IN ANY WAY AND HAVE IT. COBIT TESTING WE THINK WE WILL SO WE WELL WE THINK WE'VE GOTTEN THERE BUT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE EXTRA MILE TO MAKE SURE GO THE EXTRA MILE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- PROVIDE THE GOVERNOR THE KIND OF ASSURANCE THAT THAT HE NEEDS SO THAT HE CAN SIGN THE BILL. PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S PRIVACY AND ALSO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO NOT INTERFERE IN ANY WAY WITH COVERT TESTING. THANK YOU. COLLEAGUES IN THE OTHER- MEMBER WISH TO SPEAK SEEING NONE I'LL TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY- I SUPPORT THIS BILL LAST YEAR. I KIND OF WANT TO REHASH SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION BEFORE- LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN YOU JUST BRIEFLY- OFFER A SUMMARY ON WHERE LAW ENFORCEMENT IS ON THIS MATTER AND WHAT TOOLS STILL REMAIN AT THEIR DISPOSAL EVEN EITHER BE A PROHIBITION ON DISCLOSURES- LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN STILL. ACCESS THIS INFORMATION- WITH FOR EXAMPLE A COURT ORDER- THE CONCERN WOULD BE THAT WHERE AN A AN ENTITY WHO COLLECTS DNA ANALYZES DNA AND TURNS OVER ITS WHOLESALE DATABASE- WITHOUT ANY SORT OF PROTECTIONS IN TERMS OF PRIVACY AS YOU'LL NOTE I'VE NOT HEARD ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT AND IN OPPOSITION- AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE PROVIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT THE NECESSARY TOOLS TO CATCH SOMEONE LIKE THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER BUT AT THE SAME TIME THAT WHEN SOMEONE SIGNS UP FOR A DIRECT TO CONSUMER DNA TESTS THE THAT THEY KNOW WHEN AND THE BODY GIVEN CONSENT UP FRONT THAT THE ENTITY CAN DISTRIBUTED TO MEMBER THEY CHOOSE. BUT THAT THEY KNOW WHERE THEIR. DNA IS BEING DELIVERED. OKAY AND I THINK- THE AGGREGATING INFORMATION WHETHER IT BE DNA OR- SUBSTANTIVE FACTUAL INFORMATION NORMALLY FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT IT'S IDENTIFYING INFORMATION THAT IS OF GRAVE CONCERN SO WITH THIS BILL CREATED A PROBLEM WHEN INDIVIDUALS OR A COMPANY COLLECTS DNA RELATED MATERIEL INFORMATION IN AN AGGREGATED FORMAT FOR OTHER MEDICAL PURPOSES. AS LONG AS THERE'S NO IDENTIFIER BY VIRTUE OF NAME OR SOCIAL SECURITY IS THAT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES STILL PRESENT WITH US THE YES US AND BRITISH YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA ONE OF OUR- GREAT RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS IN THE COUNTRY MAYBE THE WORLD. IS IN SUPPORT BECAUSE THEY WILL STILL HAVE ACCESS TO NONSO DYNAMIS I THINK THAT'S HOW I PRONOUNCE IT EVERYONE PRONOUNCES IT INFORMATION IN OTHER WORDS INFORMATION THAT IS PROVIDED AS YOU SUGGEST IN THE AGGREGATE BUT NOT IDENTIFIED TO A SPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL SO IT CAN'T BE USED FOR. PURPOSES OF DENYING HEALTH CARE PURPOSES OF EMPLOYMENT THOSE KINDS OF THINGS PERFECT IN MY LAST POINT THIS IS MORE OF A GEO POLITICAL POINT- THIS STILL KEEPS US. MOVING FORWARD IN THE REALM OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE STILL KEEPS US IN THE GAME EVEN THOUGH AS WE- ARE FIGURING OUT THE NEXT FRONTIER CERTAINLY CHINA'S LEADING IN THIS REALM. THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION IS STILL HELPFUL AS WE MOVE INTO THE REALM OF UNDERSTANDING SEQUENCING AND- AND IN VARIOUS BIOMETRIC ANALYSIS SO. THAT WAS IT THANK YOU I APPRECIATE IT- DO WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE S. HAS GOING FOR NUMBER THREE I'M GOING TO Y. CASKEY HERE. ALL RIGHTS.

ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SENATOR BORDERS FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP- NEXT- CENTER LATELY BEEN WAITING VERY PATIENTLY- SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE HEARING- SB SIXTY FOUR- FIRST ARE YOU ACCEPT THE MEMBERS AS OUTLINED IN ELSE'S ON PAGE ELEVEN I AM- AND THEN SECONDLY CENTER ATER THANK YOU FOR BEING- SO DILIGENT WITH RESPECT TO THIS ISSUE AND WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND OTHERS TO. FURTHER REFINE THE BILL THANK YOU- WITHOUT FURTHER ADO SENATORS CENTER LEYVA SB SIXTY FOR THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS I HAVE TO SAY THAT SEVEN YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS APPOINTED THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE SUBCOMMITTEE ON A MOBILE HOME MOBILE MANUFACTURED HOMES. I DID NOT KNOW THAT SEVEN YEARS LATER I WOULD STILL BE JUST AS PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS ISSUE BUT I AM AND I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DID NOT LET THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS HERE KNOW HOW MANY MOBILE HOME PARKS THEY HAVE IN THEIR DISTRICT CENTER I'M BIRD YOU HAVE EIGHTY SEVEN PARKS WITH TWELVE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN SPACES. THAT ARE BORDERS YOU HAVE THREE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE PARTS WITH TWENTY ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE SPACES THAT ARE CABALLERO YOU HAVE A HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE PARKS WITH EIGHT THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THREE SPACES. SENATOR DORADO YOU HAVE THE LEAST WITH THREE PARKS AND EIGHTY SPACES CENTER GONZALEZ SIXTY SEVEN PARKS THREE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SPACES SENATOR HERTZBERG THIRTY ONE PARKS THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SIXTY SIX SPACES. SENATOR STERN YOU HAVE FORTY TWO PARKS FIVE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE SPACES AND SENATOR WHITE HOUSE DO YOU HAVE FIFTY TWO PARKS SEVEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY SPACES. THE REASON I LIKE TO DO THAT IS BECAUSE SOMETIMES I THINK WE FORGET ABOUT OUR MOBILE HOME PARKS AND A MOBILE HOME PARK RESIDENTS. MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU PERSONALLY FOR BEING AN ADVOCATE FOR MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS AT TO THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK IN PROVIDING LANGUAGE THAT WOULD CONFORM SB SIXTY ONE WITH THE RECENTLY ENACTED SB NINETY ONE. THAT PROVIDES A VICTIM PROTECTION PROTECTIONS FOR RESIDENTS. AFFECTED BY COVERT NINETEEN. I LIKE TO BEGIN BY. ALL THE MEN AND IN THE UNFORTUNATE SITUATION THAT MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL RENTAL ASSISTANCE- REVISIT THE PROVISION REGARDING REPAYMENT OF RENT IN THIS BILL. WHAT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS SB SIXTY FOUR CREATES A PROTECTIVE PROCESS FOR MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS IMPACTED BY COVERT NINETEEN BY PREVENTING THE MANAGEMENT OF MOBILE HOME PARKS FROM TERMINATING OR ATTEMPTING TO TERMINATE THE TENANCY OF AFFECTED RESIDENTS DURING A DECLARED STATE. OR LOCAL EMERGENCY RELATED TO COVER NINETEEN AS I NOTED WE HAVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THIS COMMITTEE MIRRORING THE BILL TO CONFORM TO SB NINETY ONE'S EXISTING RENTAL PROTECTIONS FOR RESIDENTS. HOWEVER SB NINETY ONE DOES NOT COVER THE SEVEN DAY NOTICE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE UNIQUE TO MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS AND WITHOUT PROTECTIONS RESIDENTS COULD FACE UNFAIR EVICTIONS. SB SIXTY FOUR WOULD ADDRESS THE SPECIFIC GAP IN SB NINETY ONE AND ALSO PROTECT MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS FROM RETALIATORY RENT INCREASES IN CALIFORNIA AS ALSO IN THE CASE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. MOBILE HOMES ARE IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING ALTERNATIVE THAT ARE MAINLY COMPRISED OF SENIORS VETERANS IMMIGRANTS AND LOW INCOME FAMILIES CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA LAW DEFINES MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS AS BOTH OWNERS AND TENANTS. BECAUSE IN SOME CASES THE RESIDENT OWNS THE ACTUAL MOBILE HOME BUT THE PARK OWNS THE LAND UNDERNEATH THE MOBILE HOME. THE PROVISION IN THE LAW ACTUALLY GIVES MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS A GREATER POTENTIAL FOR LOSS EVERY TRADITIONAL APARTMENT. OR HOME RESIDENTS WERE EVICTED THEY CAN PACK UP AND LEAVE BUT THE MOBILE HOME RESIDENT WOULD ACTUALLY LOSE IN SOME CASES THEIR BIGGEST ASET THEIR HOME VALUED MANY TIMES THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AND EVEN HIGHER. SB SIXTY FOUR WOULD ADDRESS THE SPECIFIC GAP THAT LEAVES MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS AT RISK FOR INFECTION ULTIMATELY GIVING THEM A GREATER OPPORTUNITY TO REMAIN IN THEIR HOMES. SPEAKING IN SUPPORT TODAY SB SIXTY FOUR IS STATE MAY. HOMEOWNERS LEAGUE PRESENT. LYNDON NINE IN ON THE LINE FOR TECHNICAL QUESTIONS IS BRUCE STANTON ATTORNEY FOR G. S. M. O. L. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE MEMBERS. THANK YOU CENTROLEGAL LIMIT LET ME UNDERLINE SOMETHING YOU IT SAID THAT WE ARE OPERATING UNDER THE PRESUMPTION THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL PERMIT RENTAL ASSISTANCE BE PROVIDED FOR THOSE IN MOBILE HOME PARKS- OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A BENEFIT TO BOTH OF THOSE RESIDENTS AS WELL AS A PARK OWNERS. SHOULD THIS NOT HAPPEN THEN WE HAVE TO REVISIT THIS BILL I AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE FULLY SUPPORT OF US REVISITING THE BILL IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT HIM BUT WE HAVE NO INDICATION THAT IT IS NOT GOING TO BE COVERED. BUT WE HAVE NOT GOTTEN A CLEAR STATEMENT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THIS POINT SO- NOW TURNING SIXTY WITNESSES I BELIEVE MISS NIGHT IS ON THE PHONE- WELL- LET ME SEE IF THERE'S ANY WITNESSES IN THE GALLERY AND SUPPORT. KNOWN AS SUPPORT IN ROOM ONE TWELVE. NOT IN ROOM ONE TWELVE- NOW WILL GO TO MISS NINE. GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS LINDA NOT. FINE PRESIDENT OF CABLE SHE HAD HIM AWHILE. THANK YOU KNOW JERRY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SENIOR VETERAN IMMIGRANTS ARE LIVING IN THE STATE'S LARGEST STOCK OF MODERN AFFORDABLE HOME. THESE ARE MANUFACTURED AND MOBILE HOMES. WITH THE STATE HOUSING CRISIS AND A GLOBAL PANDEMIC WE ARE GRATEFUL TO SENATOR LEAHY NOT FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THE BILL. I WANT TO CLARIFY. MUCH OF THE UNFAIR AND UNFORTUNATE MISREPRESENTATIONS FOR THE GANDER WORK WITH AN ATTORNEY ABOUT LAST YEAR SHE DIDN'T FEEL IS NOT A HAND OUT. IT PROVIDES PEOPLE WHO ARE ON FIXED INCOMES WHO AND WHO ARE LOW INCOME OR WAIT TO SEE THEIR WAY OUT OF TODAY'S ECONOMIC AND PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. THE BILL ONLY COVERS THOSE MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS WERE DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY COVERT NINETEEN. AND IT FEELS WHAT THE GOVERNOR AND OTHERS MAY HAVE LEFT OUT. MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS ARE GOVERNED BY SPECIFIC SECTIONS CIVIL CODE SECTION. WE DO THIS BILL AND THE COMMITTEE DID MANAGE LIKE OURSELVES MODEST AND REASONABLE. THE BILL IS A SMALL GUIDING LIGHT TO HELP MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS FIND THEIR WAY TO A BRIGHTER LIGHT AT THE END OF THIS LONG DARK TUNNEL. WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU I THANK YOU MISS NINE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT CENTER LEYVA NO SIR NO ALL RIGHT AND WE'VE GONE TO THE GALLERY GOING TO ROOM ONE TWELVE SO NOW- IF WE COULD GO TO THE PHONES TO SEE IF THERE ARE OTHER WITNESSES. VETERANS SUPPORT JUST AS A REMINDER YOUR NAME YOUR ORGANIZATION- IN YOUR POSITION. MISTER MODERATOR ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES WHICH TESTIFIED TELEPHONICALLY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN FOR COMMENT IN SUPPORT PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. THAT COMMAND AGAIN. ONE SEVEN ZERO. MISTER CHAIR I SHOW NO NO ONE- WAIT A COMMON ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER MODERATE WE'RE NOT GONNA TURN THE OPPOSITION- I SEE MISTER GOVERNOR WHO IS- PATIENTLY WAITING UP IN THE GALLERY MISTER GOVERNOR. THANK YOU SHARE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ENTER GOVERNOR GOVERNMENTAL ADVOCATESON BEHALF OF W. I MAY END OF OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. THIS BILL DOES NOT AFFECT RENTAL PAYMENTS MADE BY MOBILE HOME PARK RESIDENTS YOU WILL COVER THAT THREE ZERO EIGHT EIGHT SB NINETY ONE IN AB EIGHTY ONE. THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE CERES SECTION OF LAW THAT GIVES A SEVEN DAY NOTICES FOR RULES AND REGULATION VIOLATIONS. THIS IS QUALITY OF LIFE FOR ALL MOBILE HOME PARK RESIDENTS. IT WAS A SENATOR AS THAT AS CENTER LEYVA SAID YOU WILL HAVE ALL OF THOSE RESIDENTS IN YOUR DISTRICT IF YOU VOTE FOR THIS BILL YOU MAY BE HELPING ONE RESIDENT YOU'RE ACTUALLY AFFECTING THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF EVERY RESIDENT IN A PARK. AND LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT THE TIMELINE OF A SEVEN DAY NOTICE NO ONE IS GOING TO BE MADE HOMELESS IF THEY GET A SEVEN DAY NOTICE. YOU ISSUE A SEVEN DAY NOTICE SEVEN DAYS GO BY YOU THEN ISSUE A SIXTY DAY NOTICE. YOU THEN HAVE TO ISSUE AN UNLAWFUL DETAINER AFTER THAT A JUDGE RULES YOU'RE LOOKING AT A MINIMUM OF THREE TO FOUR MONTHS BEFORE SOMEONE HAS TO ADDRESS OUR RULES AND REGULATIONS. MAYBE IT'S HAVING ONE TOO MANY DOGS MAYBE IT'S HAVING TRASH ON THE PROPERTY. WITHIN THE BILL HOPPERS A SAFE HARBOR FOR SERIOUS VIOLATIONS THE PROBLEM IS THAT'S AN ILLUSORY SAFE HARBOR BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT PAGE FOUR LINE SIXTEEN. THE JUDGE ONLY LOOKS TO SEE IF IT'S A SERIOUS VIOLATION AFTER THE U. D. HAS BEEN FILED WHICH IS AFTER A MINIMUM OF SEVENTY DAYS. WHICH MEANS THAT EVERY RESIDENT IN YOUR PARK IS LIVING NEXT TO A HAZARDOUS SITUATION A VIOLENT OFFENDER OR SOMEBODY THAT IS HARMING THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE AND AGAIN THIS IS NOT ABOUT RENT. IN ADDITION IF WE DON'T HAVE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ON DAY ONE HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO THEN ENSURE THAT RESIDENTS ARE PROTECTED. SO REALLY THIS IS AN ILLUSORY SAFE HARBOR IT AFFECTS ALL RESIDENTS IN THE PARK AND WE GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE IN CENTER DOLLARS DISTRICT IN A SENIOR PARK. AN ADULT SON. ADULT SON. WITH THEIR REQUEST FOUND IS RUNNING CAR WITH USED WE NEED. BODY RMOR. ARE IN AN- WE ISSUE A SEVENTY. FOR THAT PERSON TO VACATE. THE WOMAN KICKED HER SON OUT CAME AND THANK THE MANAGEMENT. BECAUSE WITHOUT THAT SEVENTY NOTED SHE WOULD HAVE A HARD TIME PICKING UP HER SON. WHY DOES THAT PERSON NEED A YEAR TO RECTIFY KICKING OUT HER SON WHO MIGHT BE TERRORIZING EVERYONE IN THE PARK. FOR THESE REASONS AND OTHERS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL. THANK YOU MR GOVERNOR- MISTER MODERATOR ANYONE ON THE PHONE- ON WISH TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. FOUR COMMENTS IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. IT THE CHICKEN CHAIN'S IN AKRON I APOLOGIZE FOR CONFUSING THING BUT I'M ON A SEPARATE LINE AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO OFFER MY COMMENTS NOW IF YOU'D LIKE. WE HAVE- TWO WITNESSES IF YOU HAVE. AN OPPOSITION OPPOSITION. YES SIR OKAY GO AHEAD GIVE YOU TWO MINUTES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT CHANGED AMERICA WITH I DON'T THINK YOU'LL EVER ROPES AND SPENT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MOBILE HOME PARK OWNERS ALLIANCE. BUT SIMILARLY IN OPPOSITION TO SB SIXTY FOUR UNCLES PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED TO ECHO THE COMMENTS THAT MR GOVERNOR MAINTAINED AND AGREE WITH SO. MANY ANALYSIS. FROM FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF OUR GOVERNOR'S QUALITY BILLION FIRST COMPLAINED TO PARK RULES OR TO TRY TO PROTECTION IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL. MISTER CHAIR IT'S NOT JUST IMPORTANT IN THE PENSIONS WILL BECAUSE ASISTIR GOVERNOR DESCRIBED SEVENTY NOTICE AND DON'T JUST ADDRESS. MINOR ISSUES LIKE LANDSCAPING AND MAINTENANCE THE INTEREST YOUR INSTALLATION SUCH AS THE ONE HE DESCRIBES THINGS RELATED TO REPEATING VANDALISM ARSON AND BURGLARY- AND SB SIXTY FOUR WILL TAKE THAT TO THE TABLE AND PROHIBITED ACTION FOR ANY RESIDENTS IMPACTED BY COLBERT NINETEEN BUT THAT IS VERY BROADLY DEFINED IN THIS BILL. AND AS MR GOVERNOR DESCRIBED. WELCOME THAT IS. IT'S A- NOT JUST RESIDENTS WHO HAVE BY THE BUT THE OTHER RATHER WERE AROUND THE VIOLATE- THE STATE FARM PROVISION IN THE BILL. WHAT OTHER INTENDED TO ALLOW PARKING TO IN. THEM SEVEN MILLION- IT'S AN TO LOOK AT THE LINK ITSELF WHICH- THE WHICH WOULD ALLOW FOR ENFORCEMENT OF A- TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC NEWS. IN HAZARD. ASSET FOR CAN HELP THINKING SECTION ONE EIGHT YEAR THE PROBLEM IS THAT HELP SAFETY SECTION DOESN'T THE- WHAT IMMINENT HAZARD WERE PREPARED PUBLIC NUISANCE. SO APART OWNER FOR HIMSELF A TWO. WHERE THEY BELIEVE THEIR OTHER PARK RIGHT ARE THAT YOUR- THEY'RE GOING HAVE TO GO TO COURT IN. BACK QUITE BEFORE THEY CAN PER ONE ON DETAINER WHICH PASSED THE TIME TO THE THREE TO FOUR MONTHS PRIOR WITH MISTER GOVERNOR INSCRIBED IN A- LAW ENFORCING AFFECT DAY NOTE. THAT ADDITIONAL NEEDS MORE TIME FOR RESIDENTS LIVING NEXT TO NUISANCE INCLUDING THOSE RATHER PRESIDENT. GORE ALSO IMPACTED BY COVERT NINETEEN AND SIMPLY TRYING TO GET BY THANK YOU SO FOR THESE REASONS WE RISK. WHERE SPECTACLE TECHNICALLY FOR A QUESTIONABLE ALREADY THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR- OTHERS ON THE PHONE OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR I ONE. WAITING TO. IN OPPOSITION.

THIS IS CODE RELATED A LOT OF FOLKS IS FINANCES ARE IN PERIL SO I GUESS THE IDEA IS GOING BACK TO WHAT WE LEARNED ON WAS IT SB NINETY ONE WHICH WAS THE EXTENSION OF THE LANDLORD TENANT THE TENANT ISSUE IS THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS HAD TO ATTEST UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY. FATAL LACKED THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES BECAUSE OF CODE AND PROVIDE SOME DEGREE OF DOCUMENTATION TO WHATEVER IS RELEVANT AT THE TIME DOES THIS HAVE THAT SAME LEVEL OF EXPECTATION THAT'S UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY THEY HAVE TO SHOW THAT THE REASON THAT THEY CANNOT MAKE THE BUT IS IT UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY I HONESTLY DO NOT KNOW AS IT AS A AS A I MENTIONED IS GOING TO BRING THIS UP WOULD YOU CONSIDER AS A AS AN AMENDMENT ADDING THIS- TO THE REQUIREMENT OF THE BILL AS A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT SENATE RESOLUTION SIX ON BEHALF OF SENATOR SKINNER WHICH COMMEMORATES. JANUARY TWENTY SECOND TWENTY TWENTY ONE AS THE% FORTY FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF ROE V. WADE. IT'S BEEN FORTY YEARS SINCE THE U. S. SUPREME COURT RULED IN ROE V. WADE THAT A WOMAN'S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY INCLUDES A RIGHT TO ABORTION. BEFORE ROE V. WADE AN ESTIMATED ONE POINT TWO MILLION WOMEN RESORTED TO ILLEGAL ABORTION EVERY YEAR. UNSAFE ABORTIONS BECAUSE AS MANY AS FIVE THOUSAND ANNUAL DEATHS AND WOMEN OF COLOR DISPROPORTIONATELY AT RISK. AS THEY WERE MORE LIKELY TO LACK THE FUNDS TO TRAVEL TO AN AREA OF THE COUNTRY WERE SAFE ABORTIONS WERE BEING PERFORMED. MANY OF THE ECONOMIC AND RACIAL DIVIDES PERSIST TODAY AS STATES CONTINUE TO CHIP AWAY AT WOMEN'S ACCESS TO LEGAL ABORTION. WHILE MOST STATES. ARE RESTRICTING WOMEN'S HEALTH CARE CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE FEW PASSING LEGISLATION TO EXPAND ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE AS OF NOW. THAT'S CONGRESS AND STATE LEGISLATURES ACROSS AMERICA CONSIDER POLICY IN WOMEN'S HEALTH IT'S CRITICAL TO LISTEN TO DOCTORS AND MEDICAL EXPERTS WHO KNOW THAT LEGAL ABORTION IS SAFE. AND TO VOTERS WHO WANT POLITICIANS TO STOP INTERFERING WITH THEIR PERSONAL MEDICAL DECISIONS. FOR THESE REASONS WE MUST HIGHLIGHT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF ROE V. WADE AND CONTINUE TO ACT NOW AS A STATE IN ORDER TO PROTECT. REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM AND LOOK AT POLICIES THAT PROVIDE ABORTION ACCESS TO ALL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I RESPECTFULLY ASK HER AYE VOTE ON AS FAR SIX.

AMY CONEY BARRETT'S CONFIRMATION TO THE SUPREME COURT LAST YEAR SOLIDIFIED AT COURT THAT REMAIN HOSTILE TO REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AND THAT THE PORTION ACCESS NATIONALLY AT GREAT RISK WITH EIGHTEEN CASES JUST ONE STEP AWAY FROM THE SUPREME COURT WHICH COULD A ROAD OR ELIMINATE THE PROTECTION GRANTED BY ROW. WE'RE FORTUNATE HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO HAVE LEADERS WHO STAND REPLACE PARENTHOOD AND UNDERSTAND THAT ABORTION CARE IS HEALTH CARE.
