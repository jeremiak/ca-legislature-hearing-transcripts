THOSE OF US WHO WERE INVOLVED IN

AND PROBABLY THOSE WHO WARRANT

00:19:47.486 --> 00:19:49.721
COULD AGREE THAT THE FACT THAT

00:19:49.788 --> 00:19:52.524

00:20:16.014 --> 00:20:18.784
SAID. THEY CAME OUT OF THE M. P.

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:19.718
AFTERWARDS AND ONE THING THAT I

00:20:19.785 --> 00:20:21.486
THINK IS RELATED. TO YOUR

00:20:21.553 --> 00:20:22.521
QUESTION CENTER LAYERED IS THE

00:20:22.588 --> 00:20:23.989

OF THIS MARINE STEWARDS NETWORK

00:20:34.499 --> 00:20:37.936
PILOT PROGRAM- THAT WILL ALLOW

00:20:38.003 --> 00:20:39.504
TRIBES TO BUILD CAPACITY FOR

00:20:39.571 --> 00:20:40.672

THEN FIGURING OUT HOW TO SCALE

00:20:47.546 --> 00:20:50.382
THAT UP SO. I THINK- IN TERMS OF

00:21:48.106 --> 00:21:49.541
YOU SCIENCE IS A PROCESS SO

WE'RE CONTINUALLY LEARNING NOT

DECISION MAKING THAT WE DO- I

00:22:43.795 --> 00:22:45.597
THINK. ONE OF THE FRONTIERS FOR

00:22:45.664 --> 00:22:48.333
US WITH THE MPAS. SENATOR THERE

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.068
IT IS THAT SOMETHING WE

00:22:50.135 --> 00:22:51.336
DISCUSSED A LITTLE BIT EARLIER

00:22:51.403 --> 00:22:52.437
THAT SOME OF THE SPECIES THAT

00:22:52.504 --> 00:22:54.239

00:22:54.306 --> 00:22:56.708
SAM AND THE STEEL HEAD. THAT

00:22:56.775 --> 00:22:58.543
DEPEND ON BOTH THE OCEAN AND THE

00:23:14.926 --> 00:23:16.628

SAID TO USE IT AND GET THEIR

00:29:44.349 --> 00:29:46.251
MONEY'S WORTH AND I THINK THAT

00:29:46.317 --> 00:29:48.086
THAT COULD BE A GOOD A GOOD-

00:29:48.153 --> 00:29:49.754

NECESSARILY HAVE A LOT OF ACCESS

00:30:06.337 --> 00:30:08.039
TO IT. I FEEL LIKE THERE ARE

00:30:08.106 --> 00:30:09.674
THREE PARTS TO THIS ONE IS

00:30:11.843 --> 00:30:14.445
SPACES ANOTHER IS GETTING

00:30:14.512 --> 00:30:16.214

PARENTS ALSO ADULTS- OUT INTO

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:19.984
PLACES WHERE THEY CAN HUNT AND

00:30:20.051 --> 00:30:21.819
FISH. AND THEN THE THIRD PIECE

00:30:21.886 --> 00:30:23.254
OF THIS IS ACCESS TO DECISION

00:30:23.321 --> 00:30:24.822
MAKING AND PARTICIPATION IN THIS

00:30:24.889 --> 00:30:26.824
WHOLE PROCESS YEAH JUST. MAKING

00:30:26.891 --> 00:30:28.293
IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE

00:30:28.359 --> 00:30:29.527
PARTICULARLY IN CITIES BECAUSE

00:30:29.594 --> 00:30:30.962
CALIFORNIA IS THE MOST URBAN

00:30:31.029 --> 00:30:32.430
STATE IN THE UNITED STATES THAT

00:30:32.497 --> 00:30:34.966
DOESN'T MEAN THAT- THE NON URBAN

00:30:35.033 --> 00:30:36.167
AREAS AREN'T IMPORTANT I THINK

00:30:36.234 --> 00:30:37.735
IT JUST MEANS THAT. IT'S MORE

00:30:37.802 --> 00:30:40.972
IMPORTANT WORK AND- MORE URGENT

00:30:41.039 --> 00:30:43.041
WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

00:30:43.107 --> 00:30:44.676
SERVING THOSE COMMUNITIES AND

00:30:44.742 --> 00:30:46.978
KEEPING THEM CONNECTED TO LAND

00:30:47.045 --> 00:30:50.215
WATER AND WILDLIFE SO- I WAS

00:30:50.281 --> 00:30:51.816
VERY VERY EXCITED TO SEE THE

00:30:51.883 --> 00:30:54.385
ACTORS FOR ALL. AT NEWS THAT

00:30:54.452 --> 00:30:55.787
THERE'S SO MUCH FUNDING GOING

00:30:55.853 --> 00:30:57.222
INTO CREATING MORE GREEN SPACE

00:30:57.288 --> 00:30:59.224
AND PARKS IN URBAN AREAS AND

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:01.159
PARTICULARLY WITH. REGARD TO

00:31:01.226 --> 00:31:02.360
UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES

00:31:02.427 --> 00:31:04.629
RECEIVING MORE OF THAT BENEFIT

00:31:04.696 --> 00:31:06.331
AND THEY HAVE HISTORICALLY-

00:31:06.397 --> 00:31:08.700
WILDLIFE FOLLOWS GREEN SPACE

00:31:08.766 --> 00:31:11.936
INTO CITIES AND BASS AT. YOU

00:31:12.003 --> 00:31:13.438
KNOW IT'S TRUE WHETHER WHAT

00:31:13.504 --> 00:31:14.439
YOU'RE RESTORING IS THE L. A.

00:31:14.505 --> 00:31:16.641
RIVER OR WHETHER IT'S NEW GREEN

00:31:16.708 --> 00:31:18.943
SPACE- YOU KNOW FOR ATHLETIC

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:21.379
FIELDS AND SO ON. ANOTHER PIECE

00:31:21.446 --> 00:31:24.582
OF THIS IS. WHAT COMMISSIONERATE

00:31:24.649 --> 00:31:26.050
MENTIONED I WAS JUST READING

00:31:26.117 --> 00:31:28.486
ABOUT STOCKING I THINK IT WAS OF

00:31:28.553 --> 00:31:29.954
BROOK TROUT INTO- URBAN PONDS IN

00:31:30.021 --> 00:31:31.422
SACRAMENTO THAT. WAS IN THE NEWS

00:31:31.489 --> 00:31:34.292
THIS WEEK- THAT'S HAPPENING AND

00:31:34.359 --> 00:31:35.193
THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:36.828
CAN SUPPORT. AND THEN WITH

00:31:36.894 --> 00:31:39.130
RESPECT TO IT SO WE'RE BRINGING

00:31:39.197 --> 00:31:40.231
WILDLIFE INTO THE CITY'S

00:31:40.298 --> 00:31:41.899
OPPORTUNITIES INTO CITIES AND

00:31:41.966 --> 00:31:43.067
THEN I THINK WE ALSO REALLY WANT

00:31:43.134 --> 00:31:44.602
TO WORK TO SUPPORT MORE ACCESS

00:31:44.669 --> 00:31:46.938
THROUGH EFFORTS LIKE OUR THREE-

00:31:47.005 --> 00:31:48.239
RETREAT RETAIN REACTIVATE

00:31:48.306 --> 00:31:50.508
PROGRAM. WHAT THAT OFTEN LOOKS

00:31:50.575 --> 00:31:52.777
LIKE IS. ITS PARTNERS OF THE

00:31:52.844 --> 00:31:54.646
DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE.

00:31:54.712 --> 00:31:56.080
IT IS COMMERCIAL FISHING BOAT

00:31:56.147 --> 00:31:57.482
OPERATORS VOLUNTEERING THEIR

00:31:57.548 --> 00:31:59.450
TIME AND RESOURCES TO TAKE A

00:31:59.517 --> 00:32:01.519
GROUP OF KIDS OUT SO THAT THEY

00:32:01.586 --> 00:32:03.054
CAN LEARN TO FISH IN THE OCEAN

00:32:03.121 --> 00:32:04.389
AND THAT'S THE KIND OF

00:32:04.455 --> 00:32:05.523
EXPERIENCE THAT YOU KNOW CAN

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:07.325
REALLY CHANGE THEIR LIVES AND-

00:32:07.392 --> 00:32:09.193
GET THEM HOOKED FOR LIFE. THE

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:10.628
THIRD PIECE OF THAT IS ACCESS TO

00:32:10.695 --> 00:32:12.664
DECISION MAKING AND THAT JUSTICE

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:14.999
EQUITY DIVERSITY INCLUSION PLAN.

00:32:15.066 --> 00:32:18.102
THAT WHEN I JOIN THE COMMISSION

00:32:18.169 --> 00:32:21.005

00:32:21.072 --> 00:32:23.007

INCLUSIVE- AND EFFECTIVE AT

00:32:30.348 --> 00:32:31.949
MOVING THAT FORWARD AND THAT

00:32:32.016 --> 00:32:34.485
REALLY ADDRESSES BOTH ACCESS TO

00:32:34.552 --> 00:32:36.354
NATURE AND ACCESS TO THIS WHOLE

00:32:36.421 --> 00:32:38.389
DECISION MAKING PROCESS ONE OF

00:32:38.456 --> 00:32:39.290
THE THINGS THAT HAPPEN WHEN WE

00:32:39.357 --> 00:32:40.625
WENT REMOTE BUT OUR COMMISSION

00:32:40.692 --> 00:32:42.660
MEETINGS IS THAT WE REALIZED

00:32:42.727 --> 00:32:43.895

IN A TO TRAVEL AND TAKE TIME OFF

00:32:46.998 --> 00:32:49.600
OF WORK. SO I THINK THAT'S JUST

00:32:49.667 --> 00:32:52.403
ONE OTHER WAY THAT WE ARE REALLY

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:53.805

00:37:31.515 --> 00:37:33.451
EXTENSIVE RESPONSE TO ALL OF THE

00:37:33.517 --> 00:37:34.585
QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED AND

00:37:34.652 --> 00:37:36.087
THAT MAKES OUR JOBS I THINK A

00:37:36.153 --> 00:37:37.822
LOT EASIER WHEN IT'S IN WRITING

00:37:37.888 --> 00:37:39.323
AND WE CAN GET SOME INFORMATION

00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:41.325
AND A HEAD OF TIME AND SO I DO

00:37:41.392 --> 00:37:43.060
REALLY APPRECIATE THAT I DO HAVE

00:37:43.127 --> 00:37:44.629
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS THOUGH.

00:37:44.695 --> 00:37:46.330
AND I DON'T MIND IF WE CONTINUE

00:37:46.397 --> 00:37:47.865
IN THE SAME ORDER THAT WE TOOK

00:37:47.932 --> 00:37:49.233
THE PREVIOUS QUESTIONS I'LL ASK

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:50.901
THE ONE QUESTION EACH OF YOU CAN

00:37:50.968 --> 00:37:53.137
ANSWER I HAVE THREE QUESTIONS

00:37:53.204 --> 00:37:54.572
I'M THE FIRST ONE IS WHEN

00:37:54.639 --> 00:37:56.273
SETTING HUNTING AND FISHING

00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:58.709
REGULATIONS HOW DO YOU. WAIT

00:37:58.776 --> 00:38:02.146
BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE AGAINST

00:38:02.213 --> 00:38:03.981
AND ONE IS A NON SCIENTIFIC

00:38:04.048 --> 00:38:06.384
PUBLIC IMPACT ON YOUR DECISION

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:08.519
MAKING PROCESS BECAUSE I KNOW

00:38:08.586 --> 00:38:10.955
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE

00:38:11.022 --> 00:38:13.958
OUT THERE THAT DON'T WANT S. YOU

00:38:14.025 --> 00:38:17.094
KNOW INVADING ANIMAL HABITATS I

00:38:17.161 --> 00:38:19.263
GUESS I'M IS THE BEST WAY TO

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:21.932
EXPLAIN IT. SO HOW DO YOU WEIGH

00:38:21.999 --> 00:38:24.235
AND THE DECISIONS YOU MAKE ON

00:38:24.301 --> 00:38:26.103
HUNTING AND FISHING REGULATIONS

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:30.007
BASED ON SCIENCE AND NOT. AND

00:38:30.074 --> 00:38:31.175
WHAT COMES IN FROM NON

00:38:31.242 --> 00:38:35.079
SCIENTIFIC PUBLIC MEMBERS IF

00:38:35.146 --> 00:38:35.646
THAT MAKES SENSE. THANK YOU

00:38:35.713 --> 00:38:37.748
LET'S GO TO I JACKAL HOSTILE

00:38:37.815 --> 00:38:40.484
HARMISON'S FIRST. I THANK YOU

00:38:40.551 --> 00:38:42.586
SENATOR GROWTH FOR THE QUESTION

00:38:42.653 --> 00:38:46.390
NO- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS.

00:38:46.457 --> 00:38:49.393
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO ME TO

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:50.761
LOOK AT THE BEST AVAILABLE

00:38:50.828 --> 00:38:55.299
SCIENCE TO INCORPORATE ANY ANY

00:38:55.366 --> 00:38:58.202
INFORMATION- ALSO TRADITIONAL

00:38:58.269 --> 00:39:00.571
ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE FROM THE

00:39:00.638 --> 00:39:01.706
FROM THE TRIBES OF THE CULTURAL

00:39:01.772 --> 00:39:04.875
LEADERS. BUT I REALLY ALSO LOOK

00:39:04.942 --> 00:39:07.611
AT CITIZEN SCIENCE- YOU KNOW OUR

00:39:07.678 --> 00:39:09.814
FISHERMEN OUT HERE IN NORTHERN

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:12.917
CALIFORNIA THEY'RE THE VERY BEST

00:39:12.983 --> 00:39:14.585
EFFORTS OUT THERE ON THE WATER

00:39:14.652 --> 00:39:16.620
AS TO WHAT'S HAPPENING AND THEY

00:39:16.687 --> 00:39:18.589
IN FACT TO GET INVOLVED AND

00:39:18.656 --> 00:39:20.491
COLLECT DATA FOR THE DEPARTMENT

00:39:20.558 --> 00:39:22.793
AT TIMES SO FOR ME IT'S A

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:28.232
ROBUST. OVERVIEW OF ALL ALL.

00:39:28.299 --> 00:39:31.235
PEOPLE ALSO ITEMS. THE DIFFERENT

00:39:31.302 --> 00:39:33.137
TYPES OF SCIENCE AND THEN COMING

00:39:33.204 --> 00:39:35.106
UP WITH WHAT'S BEST FOR THE

00:39:35.172 --> 00:39:37.842
RESOURCE WHAT IS BEST FOR THAT-

00:39:37.908 --> 00:39:41.712
SPECIES. SO IT IS IT'S A MULTI

00:39:41.779 --> 00:39:43.647
FACETED DECISION WITH LOTS OF

00:39:43.714 --> 00:39:47.017
RESEARCH AND- TAKING THAT THE

00:39:47.084 --> 00:39:48.652
PUBLIC INPUT IS EXTREMELY

00:39:48.719 --> 00:39:50.721
IMPORTANT A LOT OF TIMES WE

00:39:50.788 --> 00:39:53.390
RECEIVED GREAT INFORMATION THE

00:39:53.457 --> 00:39:55.493
DAY OF THE MEETING ON THAT ITEM.

00:39:55.559 --> 00:39:57.361
SO THOSE THOSE ARE THE WAYS I'D

00:39:57.428 --> 00:39:59.530
I'D BALLOTS IT AND TRY TO MAKE

00:39:59.597 --> 00:40:02.099
THE BEST AVAILABLE DECISION WITH

00:40:02.166 --> 00:40:05.102
SCIENCE BEING THAT THE

00:40:05.169 --> 00:40:07.671
FOUNDATION. THANK YOU- MISS

00:40:07.738 --> 00:40:10.174
MARIE. YES THANK YOU FOR THE

00:40:10.241 --> 00:40:13.611
QUESTION SENATOR- I WISH THAT I

00:40:13.677 --> 00:40:15.379
HAD A SORT OF COOKIE CUTTER

00:40:15.446 --> 00:40:17.081
RESPONSE THAT WE APPLY IN EVERY

00:40:17.148 --> 00:40:18.582
CASE BUT IT FOR ME I'S NOT LIKE

00:40:18.649 --> 00:40:20.785
THAT RIGHT ITS CASE BY CASE WE

00:40:20.851 --> 00:40:22.586
TAKE THE SCIENCE ARE THERE ARE

00:40:22.653 --> 00:40:24.421
DECISIONS ARE DRIVEN BY SCIENCE

00:40:24.488 --> 00:40:26.290
AND THEY MUST ABSOLUTELY BE

00:40:26.357 --> 00:40:29.460
INFORMED BY SCIENCE. AND WE ALSO

00:40:29.527 --> 00:40:30.961
CARE ABOUT COMMUNITY IS RIGHT

00:40:31.028 --> 00:40:32.496
ESPECIALLY AS W ARE BUILDING

00:40:32.563 --> 00:40:33.898
OUT THIS JUSTICE EQUITY

00:40:33.964 --> 00:40:36.100
DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION. I WORK

00:40:36.167 --> 00:40:40.171
PLAN AND POLICY AND ENVISION- WE

00:40:40.237 --> 00:40:41.305
YOU KNOW I DON'T I'LL SPEAK FOR

00:40:41.372 --> 00:40:43.040
ME PERSONALLY IT'S INCREDIBLY

00:40:43.107 --> 00:40:47.311
IMPORTANT TO REALLY. EARNESTLY

00:40:47.378 --> 00:40:48.646
BALANCE ARE DUAL

00:40:48.712 --> 00:40:50.648
RESPONSIBILITIES OF A HEALTHY

00:40:50.714 --> 00:40:51.916
BIODIVERSE AND NATURAL

00:40:51.982 --> 00:40:53.751
CALIFORNIA WHERE NATIVE FISH AND

00:40:53.818 --> 00:40:55.553
WILDLIFE THRIVE IN DYNAMIC

00:40:55.619 --> 00:40:58.122
ECOSYSTEMS WHILE ALSO INSPIRING

00:40:58.189 --> 00:40:59.790
HUMAN INTERACTION AND ENJOYMENT

00:40:59.857 --> 00:41:01.625
AND THAT INCLUDES NON

00:41:01.692 --> 00:41:03.194
CONSUMPTIVE AND CONSUMPTIVE

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:06.964
RECREATION SO THOSE ARE TWO- TWO

00:41:07.031 --> 00:41:08.999
GOALSTHAT WE HAVE THAT THAT DO

00:41:09.066 --> 00:41:11.535
NOT ALWAYS SQUARE RIGHT AND SO

00:41:11.602 --> 00:41:13.304
IT IS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO TAKE

00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:15.539
THE SCIENCE AND ACHIEVE THOSE

00:41:15.606 --> 00:41:18.375
TWO GOALS AND- THE WAY THAT WE

00:41:18.442 --> 00:41:19.910
DO IT IS WE READ THE PUBLIC

00:41:19.977 --> 00:41:21.278
COMMENTS YOU KNOW OUR BINDERS

00:41:21.345 --> 00:41:23.247
ARE SOMETIMES TWO THOUSAND PAGES

00:41:23.314 --> 00:41:24.715
GOING INTO A MEETING AND A LOT

00:41:24.782 --> 00:41:26.383
OF THAT IS IT'S STAFF MEMBERS

00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:28.719
BUT IT'S ALSO. SCIENTIFIC PAPERS

00:41:28.786 --> 00:41:30.454
AND A LOT OF IT IS PUBLIC

00:41:30.521 --> 00:41:31.355
COMMENTS AND WE READ THOSE

00:41:31.422 --> 00:41:34.024
COMMENTS WE LISTEN- DURING

00:41:34.091 --> 00:41:36.527
MEETINGS I HAVE SEEN YOU KNOW

00:41:36.594 --> 00:41:38.128
TIMES WHERE WE AS A COMMISSION

00:41:38.195 --> 00:41:39.930
ARE ALL AGAIN SPEAK FOR MYSELF I

00:41:39.997 --> 00:41:42.099
GO INTO A MEETING THINKING MAYBE

00:41:42.166 --> 00:41:43.334
THERE'S GOING TO BE ONE OUTCOME

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:44.535
AND THEN AFTER HEARING WHAT

00:41:44.602 --> 00:41:46.003
EVERYBODY SAYS IT'S A DIFFERENT

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:48.172
OUTCOME- THE OTHER THING I'LL

00:41:48.239 --> 00:41:49.874
SAY IS WE DON'T ALWAYS HAVE

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:52.176
COMPLETE DATA SETS RIGHT WE

00:41:52.243 --> 00:41:53.878
DON'T ALWAYS HAVE ALL THE DATA

00:41:53.944 --> 00:41:56.247
THAT WE WISH THAT WE HAD. AND WE

00:41:56.313 --> 00:41:57.915
STILL NEED TO MAKE ART YOU KNOW

00:41:57.982 --> 00:41:59.683
A DECISION BASED ON THE BEST

00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:00.751
AVAILABLE SCIENCE THAT WE DO

00:42:00.818 --> 00:42:03.287
HAVE AND THE INTERESTS OF

00:42:03.354 --> 00:42:05.256
STAKEHOLDERS AND THESE TWO

00:42:05.322 --> 00:42:08.058
IMPORTANT GOALS THAT WE HAVE-

00:42:08.125 --> 00:42:09.526
SOMETIMES WE GET LUCKY FOR

00:42:09.593 --> 00:42:11.128
EXAMPLE A COUPLE OF WITHIN THE

00:42:11.195 --> 00:42:12.396
LAST COUPLE YEARS THERE WAS A

00:42:12.463 --> 00:42:13.364
PACIFIC HERRING FISHERY

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:14.265
MANAGEMENT PLAN WERE

00:42:14.331 --> 00:42:16.500
STAKEHOLDERS BOTH FISHERMEN AND

00:42:16.567 --> 00:42:17.601
ENVIRONMENTAL NON GOVERNMENT

00:42:17.668 --> 00:42:19.737
ORGANIZATIONS GOT TOGETHER AND

00:42:19.803 --> 00:42:22.039
SORT OF. CREATED A DRAFT AT THEM

00:42:22.106 --> 00:42:25.142
HE LARGELY FOR US RIGHT THAT'S

00:42:25.209 --> 00:42:26.543
WHEN WE GOT REALLY LUCKY AND

00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:28.112
WERE ABLE TO GET SOMETHING THAT

00:42:28.178 --> 00:42:29.647
THEY WORKED ON TOGETHER AND WE

00:42:29.713 --> 00:42:31.482
CAN APPROVE IT UNANIMOUSLY AND

00:42:31.548 --> 00:42:33.517
THEY DO SOME OF THAT WORK FOR US

00:42:33.584 --> 00:42:34.952
AND I DO THINK WE SEE THAT MORE

00:42:35.019 --> 00:42:36.287
AND MORE I THINK THE WAY THAT

00:42:36.353 --> 00:42:38.055
NATURAL RESOURCES POLICY AND

00:42:38.122 --> 00:42:40.057
MANAGEMENT IS UNDERTAKEN HAS

00:42:40.124 --> 00:42:42.192
CHANGED A LOT JUST IN THE TWENTY

00:42:42.259 --> 00:42:43.527
YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON

00:42:43.594 --> 00:42:47.464
IT. AND SO WHEN THAT HAPPENS WE

00:42:47.531 --> 00:42:48.999
GET VERY LUCKY- WHEN OF DOZENS

00:42:49.066 --> 00:42:50.467
KNOW WE'VE DO THE THAT WE CAN

00:42:50.534 --> 00:42:52.569
TAKE IN THE SCIENCE. TWO GOALS

00:42:52.636 --> 00:42:54.939
AND LISTENING TO THE FOLKS WHO

00:42:55.005 --> 00:42:56.941
COME IN AND TALK TO US. THANK

00:42:57.007 --> 00:43:00.010
YOU DOCTORS A LOT OF A LOT OF

00:43:00.077 --> 00:43:03.280
SORRY. THANKS WELL I'M A

00:43:03.347 --> 00:43:06.216
SCIENTIST SO I LIKE SCIENCE AS I

00:43:06.283 --> 00:43:09.987
THINK EVIDENCE AS YOU KNOW IT.

00:43:10.054 --> 00:43:11.188
IT'S NECESSARY BUT IT'S NOT

00:43:11.255 --> 00:43:12.656
SUFFICIENT FOR OUR DECISIONS TO

00:43:12.723 --> 00:43:13.857
BE SUPPORTED BY EVIDENCE FOR

00:43:13.924 --> 00:43:15.259
MANY OF THE REASONS THAT

00:43:15.326 --> 00:43:18.329
MISSIONARY JUST RAISED- I THINK

00:43:18.395 --> 00:43:19.930
YOU KNOW WHAT WE SOMETIMES CAN

00:43:19.997 --> 00:43:22.099
CAN LAY SIDE OF IS THAT THE WAY

00:43:22.166 --> 00:43:23.167
THAT HUNTING AND FISHING OR

00:43:23.233 --> 00:43:25.202
SUSTAINS NOW IS THAT. YOU KNOW

00:43:25.269 --> 00:43:27.071
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE SCIENCE

00:43:27.137 --> 00:43:28.305
BASED MODERN MANAGEMENT AND

00:43:28.372 --> 00:43:29.540
THAT'S SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART OF

00:43:29.606 --> 00:43:31.175
WHAT WE DO WITH THE COMMISSION

00:43:31.241 --> 00:43:32.109
AND IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE

00:43:32.176 --> 00:43:35.045
DEPARTMENT. SO OF COURSE THE

00:43:35.112 --> 00:43:36.180
SCIENCE IS VERY IMPORTANT THE

00:43:36.246 --> 00:43:37.381
OTHER PIECE OF THAT IS THAT OUR

00:43:37.448 --> 00:43:40.451
DECISIONS BE SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE

00:43:40.517 --> 00:43:43.721
AND SOCIALLY- SUPPORTED. BUT I

00:43:43.787 --> 00:43:46.090
WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT WE HAVE

00:43:46.156 --> 00:43:47.958
THAT TO MISSION. AS A COMMISSION

00:43:48.025 --> 00:43:50.027
SO WE HAVE THIS DEAL MISSION TO

00:43:50.094 --> 00:43:51.195
PROMOTE INTO REGULATE

00:43:51.261 --> 00:43:52.963
OPPORTUNITIES TO ENJOY. THOSE

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:54.898
INCLUDE HUNTING AND FISHING- AND

00:43:54.965 --> 00:43:56.767
TO PROTECT NATIVE WILDLIFE AND

00:43:56.834 --> 00:43:58.102
IN THE LONG RUN IT'S A LITTLE

00:43:58.168 --> 00:44:00.637
BIT OF A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE

00:44:00.704 --> 00:44:03.907
MAYBE AND- AT. JUST ARTICULATED

00:44:03.974 --> 00:44:05.542
I THINK IN THE LONG TERM

00:44:05.609 --> 00:44:06.543
PROTECTING WILDLIFE REQUIRES

00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:07.311
SUSTAINING PEOPLE'S

00:44:07.378 --> 00:44:11.115
RELATIONSHIPS TO IT SO. THOSE

00:44:11.181 --> 00:44:11.982
RELATIONSHIPS HAVE ALWAYS

00:44:12.049 --> 00:44:13.817
INCLUDED HUNTING AND FISHING

00:44:13.884 --> 00:44:14.718
SOMETIMES WHEN WE HAVE

00:44:14.785 --> 00:44:16.387
INCOMPLETE INFORMATION WE HAVE

00:44:16.453 --> 00:44:18.489
TO WEIGH. THE RISKS AND THE

00:44:18.555 --> 00:44:21.125
UNCERTAINTY AROUND AT ALLOWING

00:44:21.191 --> 00:44:23.327
HARDEST AGAINST THE RISKS AND

00:44:23.394 --> 00:44:25.162
UNCERTAINTY AROUND SEVERING

00:44:25.229 --> 00:44:27.364
PEOPLE'S RELATIONSHIP TO THE

00:44:27.431 --> 00:44:29.199
WILDLIFE THAT THEY HUNT AND FISH

00:44:29.266 --> 00:44:31.402
SO WE ALWAYS A BALANCING ACT

00:44:31.468 --> 00:44:33.203
THERE BUT I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT

00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:36.173
I WOULD COME BACK TO IS THAT-

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.475
HUNTING AND FISHING ARE. CORE

00:44:38.542 --> 00:44:41.578
PARTS OF WHAT WE SUPPORT AS ACT

00:44:41.645 --> 00:44:44.148
AS A COMMISSION AND SO THOSE TWO

00:44:44.214 --> 00:44:45.182
PIECES OF OUR MISSION GO

00:44:45.249 --> 00:44:46.650
TOGETHER WE NEED HEALTHY

00:44:46.717 --> 00:44:48.185
WILDLIFE POPULATIONS TO SUSTAIN

00:44:48.252 --> 00:44:49.219
US HUNTING AND FISHING

00:44:49.286 --> 00:44:50.454
OPPORTUNITIES AND WE NEED

00:44:50.521 --> 00:44:53.424
HUNTING AND FISHING TO SUSTAIN

00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:54.958
PEOPLE'S CONNECTIONS TO WILDLIFE

00:44:55.025 --> 00:44:56.393
. THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL VERY

00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:57.728
MUCH AND THE NEXT QUESTION I

00:44:57.795 --> 00:44:59.196
HAVE IS IN YOUR OPINION SHOULD

00:44:59.263 --> 00:45:00.831
THE COMMISSION'S REGULATORY

00:45:00.898 --> 00:45:02.366
PROCESSES SUPPORT GREATER

00:45:02.433 --> 00:45:03.934
FISHING AND HUNTING

00:45:04.001 --> 00:45:06.336
OPPORTUNITIES SUCH AS- INCREASED

00:45:06.403 --> 00:45:08.172
A BAG LIMITS TAGS AND THOSE

00:45:08.238 --> 00:45:09.606
KINDS OF THINGS IF THE SCIENCE

00:45:09.673 --> 00:45:15.579
IS THERE TO. AND SUPPORT IT.

00:45:15.646 --> 00:45:17.481
MYTHOS LEARN KARMA FINALLY JUST

00:45:17.548 --> 00:45:18.715
GO AHEAD AND START WITH YOU

00:45:18.782 --> 00:45:19.716
AGAIN WILL KEEP GOING IN THIS

00:45:19.783 --> 00:45:22.052
ORDER. YOU'RE DOING WELL AT IT

00:45:22.119 --> 00:45:24.721
YOU'RE DOING SO WELL I DON'T

00:45:24.788 --> 00:45:27.658
NEED TO. SAY ANYTHING. YOU KNOW-

00:45:27.724 --> 00:45:30.461
SENATOR GROSS I REALLY BELIEVE.

00:45:30.527 --> 00:45:31.895
THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS

00:45:31.962 --> 00:45:33.764
YES I THINK THE COMMISSION

00:45:33.831 --> 00:45:36.533
SHOULD SUPPORT- INCREASED BAG

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:39.703
LIMIT. ON INCREASED OPPORTUNITY

00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:42.272
FOR OUR HUNTING AND ANGLING

00:45:42.339 --> 00:45:44.274
COMMUNITIES VERY DEFINITELY-

00:45:44.341 --> 00:45:47.411
EVERY EVERY DAY IN IN MY NORMAL

00:45:47.478 --> 00:45:49.880
DAY TO DAY JOB. I COME INTO

00:45:49.947 --> 00:45:51.582
CONTACT WITH FOLKS WHO DON'T

00:45:51.648 --> 00:45:53.550
UNDERSTAND THE REGULATION THEY

00:45:53.617 --> 00:45:55.519
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY CAN'T

00:45:55.586 --> 00:45:57.654
GO OUT. AND FISH DURING CERTAIN

00:45:57.721 --> 00:45:59.289
TIMES OR WHY THE HELL OF IT

00:45:59.356 --> 00:46:01.658
SEASON HAS BEEN. CUT OFF IN

00:46:01.725 --> 00:46:03.760
AUGUST WHEN NORMALLY IN THE PAST

00:46:03.827 --> 00:46:06.530
AND IT WAS IN OCTOBER SO I

00:46:06.597 --> 00:46:08.265
ANSWERED THOSE QUESTIONS ON A

00:46:08.332 --> 00:46:10.200
DAILY BASIS AND I THINK WHEN THE

00:46:10.267 --> 00:46:13.003
SCIENCE ALLOWS. ABSOLUTELY WE

00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:15.072
SHOULD BE. PROVIDING ANOTHER

00:46:15.139 --> 00:46:18.775
OPPORTUNITY- IF IT IS NOT THAT

00:46:18.842 --> 00:46:20.711
RISKS TO THE SPECIES I THINK

00:46:20.777 --> 00:46:22.579
THAT ECOSYSTEM BASED MANAGEMENT

00:46:22.646 --> 00:46:25.249
IS IMPERATIVE. BUT ALSO THE

00:46:25.315 --> 00:46:29.520
REGARD. FOR THE HUMAN CONNECTION

00:46:29.586 --> 00:46:32.890
. THANK YOU MMHM. YEAH THANK YOU

00:46:32.956 --> 00:46:34.458
SENATOR FOR THE QUESTION YOU

00:46:34.525 --> 00:46:36.426
KNOW FOR ME IT I SAID THIS IS A

00:46:36.493 --> 00:46:38.495
VERY LAWYER ANSWERED TO GIVE BUT

00:46:38.562 --> 00:46:42.032
I AM A LAWYER SO I HAD. PLANS

00:46:42.099 --> 00:46:44.034
RIGHT IT'S GOING TO DEPEND ON

00:46:44.101 --> 00:46:45.769
THE SPECIES THAT WE'RE TALKING

00:46:45.836 --> 00:46:48.472
ABOUT- IT'S REALLY HARD FOR ME

00:46:48.539 --> 00:46:50.007
TO ANSWER THAT JUST ACROSS THE

00:46:50.073 --> 00:46:52.776
BOARD YES ALL THE TIME YOU KNOW

00:46:52.843 --> 00:46:54.845
HIGHER BAG LIMITS MORE TAKE ON

00:46:54.912 --> 00:46:57.080
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE ARE YOU KNOW

00:46:57.147 --> 00:46:59.116
IT IS I COULDN'T AGREE MORE WITH

00:46:59.183 --> 00:47:00.984
WHAT- COMMISSIONERS OF A LOT OF

00:47:01.051 --> 00:47:03.420
SAD ABOUT THE CONNECTION

00:47:03.487 --> 00:47:06.823
BETWEEN- YOU KNOW ACCESS AND

00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:09.059
OPPORTUNITY AND HOW THAT DOES

00:47:09.126 --> 00:47:11.662
FOSTER STEWARDSHIP. AND LONG

00:47:11.728 --> 00:47:13.063
TERM CONSERVATION AND THE INTER

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:14.798
RELATEDNESS OF THOSE TWO THINGS

00:47:14.865 --> 00:47:16.934
YOU KNOW IF WE DO NOT MAKE SURE

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.303
THAT WE HAVE THRIVING WILDLIFE

00:47:19.369 --> 00:47:20.938
AND ECOSYSTEMS INTO THE INTO THE

00:47:21.004 --> 00:47:22.606
FUTURE AND THEN WE NO LONGER

00:47:22.673 --> 00:47:24.608
HAVE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES TO HUNT

00:47:24.675 --> 00:47:27.377
AND FISH FOR THE SPECIES SO THEY

00:47:27.444 --> 00:47:30.013
ARE VERY MUCH INTER RELATED- I

00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:32.149
THINK IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE

00:47:32.216 --> 00:47:34.251
CHANGE INCREASING DROUGHTS

00:47:34.318 --> 00:47:36.486
INCREASING WILDFIRES AND JUST

00:47:36.553 --> 00:47:38.689
THAT SORT OF SO MANY CHANGING

00:47:38.755 --> 00:47:41.091
SYSTEMS ALL THE TIME. I CAN SAY

00:47:41.158 --> 00:47:43.060
THAT I'M COMMITTED TO PRESERVING

00:47:43.126 --> 00:47:44.561
AND ENHANCING OPPORTUNITIES

00:47:44.628 --> 00:47:46.964
WHEREVER POSSIBLE AND AT THE

00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:49.066
SAME TIME IT'S GOING TO BE A

00:47:49.132 --> 00:47:50.534
CASE BY CASE BASIS AND IT'S VERY

00:47:50.601 --> 00:47:52.202
TRICKY TO JUST GIVE UP A BLANKET

00:47:52.269 --> 00:47:54.504
APPLICATION OF SAYING IT'S

00:47:54.571 --> 00:47:56.073
ALWAYS GOING TO BE APPROPRIATE I

00:47:56.139 --> 00:47:57.741
WILL ACKNOWLEDGE YOU KNOW WE

00:47:57.808 --> 00:48:00.577
DON'T HAVE AS MANY HUNTERS AS WE

00:48:00.644 --> 00:48:02.279
DID IN THE SEVENTIES AND

00:48:02.346 --> 00:48:03.513
EIGHTIES AND IT'S A CHALLENGE

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:05.148
AND YOU KNOW THE R. THREE

00:48:05.215 --> 00:48:06.683
EFFORTS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT

00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:07.918
BEFORE ARE REALLY AT FINDING

00:48:07.985 --> 00:48:10.854
WAYS TO ENGAGE NEW AUDIENCES

00:48:10.921 --> 00:48:13.156
INCLUDING YOUNG PEOPLE. IN

00:48:13.223 --> 00:48:14.391
HUNTING AND FISHING ACTIVITIES

00:48:14.458 --> 00:48:15.959
BECAUSE I REALLY D BELIEVE

00:48:16.026 --> 00:48:17.794
SOMEBODY WHO GREW UP FISHING YOU

00:48:17.861 --> 00:48:18.895
KNOW I SAID IN MY OPENING

00:48:18.962 --> 00:48:20.964
COMMENTS I GREW UP FISHING I'M

00:48:21.031 --> 00:48:23.667
THE SON OF A OF A OF A VERY

00:48:23.734 --> 00:48:26.036
COMMITTED HUNTER- AND I WAS JUST

00:48:26.103 --> 00:48:28.038
A YOU KNOW IT'S VERY MUCH WHY I

00:48:28.105 --> 00:48:31.475
DO WHAT I DO TODAY SO I SEE AND

00:48:31.541 --> 00:48:33.510
I VALUE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN

00:48:33.577 --> 00:48:35.012
AND GETTING OUTSIDE HUNTING

00:48:35.078 --> 00:48:36.480
FISHING CONNECTING WITH THESE

00:48:36.546 --> 00:48:39.549
RESOURCES AND WANTING TO PROTECT

00:48:39.616 --> 00:48:43.520
THEM INTO THE FUTURE- AND SO. I

00:48:43.587 --> 00:48:45.622
AM. WANT THEIR CREATE ENHANCE

00:48:45.689 --> 00:48:47.691
OPPORTUNITIES WHERE WE CAN.

00:48:47.758 --> 00:48:53.730
THANK YOU. DOCTORS OF A LETTER.

00:48:53.797 --> 00:48:55.098
YES THANK YOU FOR THAT THE

00:48:55.165 --> 00:48:57.401
QUESTION SENATOR GROVE- I THINK

00:48:57.467 --> 00:48:59.636
THERE'S A LOT PACKED INTO THAT

00:48:59.703 --> 00:49:00.504
IF THE SCIENCE SUPPORTS IT

00:49:00.570 --> 00:49:03.373
RIGHT- A LOT THERE THAT DEPENDS

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:05.142
ON THE SPECIES ON THE CONTEXT ON

00:49:05.208 --> 00:49:06.310
THE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES FACING

00:49:06.376 --> 00:49:08.111
POPULATIONS BUT IF THE SCIENCE

00:49:08.178 --> 00:49:10.514
SUPPORTS IT YES I THINK THAT

00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:12.449
THAT'S PART OF OUR MISSION AND

00:49:12.516 --> 00:49:13.350
THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE IN

00:49:13.417 --> 00:49:15.185
CALIFORNIA THAN EVER PART OF OUR

00:49:15.252 --> 00:49:17.187
GOAL IS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO

00:49:17.254 --> 00:49:17.921
HUNTING AND FISHING

00:49:17.988 --> 00:49:19.623
OPPORTUNITIES AND WE CAN'T

00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:20.957
REALLY DO THAT IF WE DON'T

00:49:21.024 --> 00:49:23.393
CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITIES SO- IF

00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:27.097
THE SCIENCE SUPPORTS THAT. AND

00:49:27.164 --> 00:49:29.099
YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE ISN'T ANY

00:49:29.166 --> 00:49:31.201
SORT OF HARM ANY RISK AND IN

00:49:31.268 --> 00:49:32.069
MOVING FORWARD I THINK THE

00:49:32.135 --> 00:49:34.037
ANSWER IS YES I JUST WANT TO SAY

00:49:34.104 --> 00:49:37.040
THAT- LAST WEEK I FACILITATED A

00:49:37.107 --> 00:49:39.643
COMMISSION WORKSHOP- ON BIG GAME

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:41.645
HUNTING AND I WAS. I WAS

00:49:41.712 --> 00:49:43.046
DELIGHTED BY THE TURN OUT

00:49:43.113 --> 00:49:44.014
THERE'S A HUGE TURNOUT FROM

00:49:44.081 --> 00:49:46.216
ACROSS THE STTE AND- I THINK

00:49:46.283 --> 00:49:47.651
WHAT I WAS STRUCK BY THAT I

00:49:47.718 --> 00:49:49.186
LEARNED SO MUCH FROM THEM AND IT

00:49:49.252 --> 00:49:51.221
WASN'T JUST ABOUT PEOPLE'S VIEWS

00:49:51.288 --> 00:49:52.489
IT WAS ALSO THERE ON THE GROUND

00:49:52.556 --> 00:49:54.958
OBSERVATIONS AND KNOWLEDGE ABOUT

00:49:55.025 --> 00:49:57.027
THE STATE OF OUR WILDLIFE AND-

00:49:57.094 --> 00:49:59.162
IN LANDS AND I THINK WE HAVE A

00:49:59.229 --> 00:50:01.498
LOT OF PARTNERS WE THINKING HARD

00:50:01.565 --> 00:50:02.966
AND CRITICALLY ABOUT HOW TO

00:50:03.033 --> 00:50:05.168
INCREASE OPPORTUNITY FOR SHIFT

00:50:05.235 --> 00:50:07.537
OPPORTUNITY- YOU KNOW IN THE

00:50:07.604 --> 00:50:09.473
NAME OF NOT JUST MORE ACCESSIBLE

00:50:09.539 --> 00:50:11.608
MORE EQUITABLE ACCESS SO WE HAVE

00:50:11.675 --> 00:50:15.011
A LOT OF PROGRESS THERE WE HAVE

00:50:15.078 --> 00:50:16.646
A LOT OF WORK TO DO THERE. THANK

YES OR NO ANSWER ON SHOULD WE-

00:52:20.904 --> 00:52:22.772
VIBE MORE OPPORTUNITY IF THE

00:52:22.839 --> 00:52:24.608
SCIENCE SUPPORTS IT ONE THING

00:52:24.674 --> 00:52:26.877
THAT I WANTED TO MAKE A POINT

00:52:26.943 --> 00:52:30.113
ABOUT IS TRIBAL PEOPLE IN THEIR

00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:32.782
IN THEIR LIFETIMES HAVE DONE

00:52:32.849 --> 00:52:36.720
MANAGEMENT. THROUGH KNOWING WHEN

ANOTHER SORT OF IDENTITY BASED

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:19.128
ORGANIZATIONS OR COMMUNITY BASED

01:03:19.195 --> 01:03:20.496
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE

LOT OF POTENTIAL- WE KNOW THAT

01:03:29.071 --> 01:03:32.375
THERE ARE BARRIERS FOR WHY

01:03:32.441 --> 01:03:33.376
PEOPLE DON'T ENGAGE IN OUR

01:03:33.442 --> 01:03:35.311
PROCESS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY

SO I CAN'T PRETEND TO GUESS WHAT

01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:46.455
SOME OF THE BARRIERS ARE BUT-

01:03:46.522 --> 01:03:48.591
CONNECTING TO NEW KINDS OF

01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:50.026

AND WHAT WE DO AND SEE WHAT IT

01:04:01.337 --> 01:04:03.773
WOULD TAKE TO IN FOR FOLKS TO

WANT TO ENGAGE WITH US A LITTLE

01:04:05.308 --> 01:04:07.243

TRY TO REACH NEW FOLKS. SO I

01:04:29.265 --> 01:04:30.266
THINK THAT THOSE ARE JUST SOME

01:04:30.333 --> 01:04:32.034
OF THE IDEAS WE THOUGHT TAKEN

01:04:32.101 --> 01:04:34.070

SCIENCE IS A PROCESS I DID A

01:05:36.532 --> 01:05:37.833
PROCESS ON A BODY OF FACTS AND

01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:39.568
SO. WHAT IS THAT PROCESS IT'S

01:05:39.635 --> 01:05:41.270
TAKING OBSERVATIONS THAT'S

OF THE BEST VERSION OF THAT AS

01:05:58.154 --> 01:05:59.889

LAYERED I ACTUALLY WANT TO TAKE

01:26:37.258 --> 01:26:40.128
THE UNUSUAL. STEP OF MAKING A

01:26:40.194 --> 01:26:44.132
COMMENT BEFORE MOTION PLAN DO

WHICH IS COMMON ABOUT THIS IS

NOT YOUR GRANDFATHER'S RULES

01:26:50.705 --> 01:26:52.874
COMMITTEE AS WELL. I THINK

01:26:52.941 --> 01:26:54.909
THAT'S RIGHT R. ONE RANDOM

01:26:54.976 --> 01:26:57.478
COMMENT FIRST JUST THE REASON

01:26:57.545 --> 01:26:58.246
THIS IS THE FISH AND GAME

01:26:58.313 --> 01:27:00.648
COMMISSION AND THE DEPARTMENT

01:27:00.715 --> 01:27:02.350
TEN YEARS AGO BECAME THE FISH

01:27:02.417 --> 01:27:04.652
AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT IS THE

01:27:04.719 --> 01:27:05.653
NAME OF THE COMMISSION IS IN THE

01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:07.956
STATE CONSTITUTION SO WE COULD

01:27:08.022 --> 01:27:09.190
CHANGE THE NAME OF THE

01:27:09.257 --> 01:27:11.092
DEPARTMENT BUT WE HAVE TO WAIT

01:27:11.159 --> 01:27:13.595
TO SOME OPPORTUNE MOMENT TO HAVE

01:27:13.661 --> 01:27:15.430
THE NAME OF THE COMMISSION FALLS

01:27:15.496 --> 01:27:17.932
SO HOPEFULLY IN THE NEXT FEW

01:27:17.999 --> 01:27:19.834
YEARS WITH THOSE OF US AROUND

01:27:19.901 --> 01:27:20.935
THIS TABLE BEING HERE WE CAN

01:27:21.002 --> 01:27:22.904
FIND A PLACE WHERE THAT CAN

01:27:22.971 --> 01:27:26.574
HAPPEN. BUT THE COMMENT I REALLY

01:27:26.641 --> 01:27:29.043
WANT TO MAKE IS THAT. ON MY VERY

01:27:29.110 --> 01:27:32.747
FIRST DAY AS RESOURCES SECRETARY

01:27:32.814 --> 01:27:34.415
I GOT A CALL FROM A STATE

01:27:34.482 --> 01:27:37.452
SENATOR. WEST BROKE. WHO CALLED

01:27:37.518 --> 01:27:38.486
AND SAID I WANT TO INTRODUCE A

01:27:38.553 --> 01:27:42.423
BILL. THAT REALLY REMOVES TRIBES

01:27:42.490 --> 01:27:44.092
FROM THE MARINE PROTECTED AREA

01:27:44.158 --> 01:27:46.661
PROCESS. AND AFTER GAUGING WITH

01:27:46.728 --> 01:27:49.831
HIM FOR A FEW DAYS I SAID I KNOW

01:27:49.897 --> 01:27:50.498
HOW ARE YOU MEANT IN THE

01:27:50.565 --> 01:27:52.333
LEGISLATURE. YOU DON'T HAVE

01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:54.002
DEMAND THE GUTS OF THE BILL AND

01:27:54.068 --> 01:27:55.970
UNTIL APRIL. WOULD YOU GIVE ME

01:27:56.037 --> 01:27:57.905
TELL APRIL TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE

01:27:57.972 --> 01:28:01.309
TRIBES AND SEE IF I CAN FIND. AN

01:28:01.376 --> 01:28:04.545
ADEQUATE SOLUTION. AND SO I DID

01:28:04.612 --> 01:28:06.447
IN THOSE NEGOTIATIONS BLUE OP

01:28:06.514 --> 01:28:08.983
ARE ONCE. BUT WE GOT TO A

01:28:09.050 --> 01:28:12.620
LANDMARK AGREEMENT THAT SAID.

01:28:12.687 --> 01:28:14.455
THAT IN MARINE PROTECTED AREAS

01:28:14.522 --> 01:28:16.557
IN THE CONSERVATION AREAS OF THE

01:28:16.624 --> 01:28:18.960
TRIBE CAN. DEMONSTRATE A

01:28:19.027 --> 01:28:21.963
HISTORIC TAKE FOR SUBSISTENCE

01:28:22.030 --> 01:28:25.166
FOR CEREMONIAL PURPOSES THEY CAN

01:28:25.233 --> 01:28:26.901
DO THAT IN THE CONSERVATION

01:28:26.968 --> 01:28:30.371
AREA. AND IT TOOK TRIBES ONCE

01:28:30.438 --> 01:28:32.306
THE COMMISSION APPROVED IT FROM

01:28:32.373 --> 01:28:34.742
OPPOSITION TO MARINE PROTECTED

01:28:34.809 --> 01:28:37.412
AREAS. TO SUPPORT AND ONE OF THE

01:28:37.478 --> 01:28:39.847
THINGS THAT CAME UP IN THAT

01:28:39.914 --> 01:28:43.518
PROCESS. WAS A TRIBAL. OF PEOPLE

01:28:43.584 --> 01:28:45.420
IN CALIFORNIA FEELING WHAT THEY

01:28:45.486 --> 01:28:46.387
WANT REPRESENTED ON THIS

01:28:46.454 --> 01:28:48.089
COMMISSION THAT THEY WERE NOT

01:28:48.156 --> 01:28:49.457
WITHIN IT AND SO ONE OF THE

01:28:49.524 --> 01:28:51.426
FIRST APPOINTMENT STUFF WAS MADE

01:28:51.492 --> 01:28:55.630
BY THE ADMINISTRATION. OF WAS

01:28:55.697 --> 01:28:57.031
JACQUI HOSLER KARMA'S. AND I

01:28:57.098 --> 01:28:59.801
THINK THAT TODAY'S TESTIMONY IS

01:28:59.867 --> 01:29:01.469
A TRIBUTE TO THE FACT THAT SHE

01:29:01.536 --> 01:29:03.538
LIVED UP TO EVERYTHING THAT WAS

01:29:03.604 --> 01:29:06.340
THE REASON THAT WE WANTED HER ON

01:29:06.407 --> 01:29:07.542
THE COMMISSION IN THE FIRST

01:29:07.608 --> 01:29:09.477
PLACE THE FACT THAT IMMEDIATELY.

01:29:09.544 --> 01:29:11.412
A TRIBAL REPRESENTATIVE OR STOP

01:29:11.479 --> 01:29:12.680
IN THE HALLWAY AND SAY HOW DO I

01:29:12.747 --> 01:29:14.949
INTERACT WITH THE SYSTEM. AND WE

01:29:15.016 --> 01:29:16.451
HAD TO FLUSH OUT THINGS OVER

01:29:16.517 --> 01:29:18.453
TIME THAT WERE IN THAT AGREEMENT

01:29:18.519 --> 01:29:19.887
SUCH AS WHAT IS SUBSISTENCE WERE

01:29:19.954 --> 01:29:22.123
NOW ON THE COMMISSION HE'S

01:29:22.190 --> 01:29:23.124
WORKING ON THE DEFINITION OF

01:29:23.191 --> 01:29:25.326
SUBSISTENCE. AND TRIBES ARE

01:29:25.393 --> 01:29:27.261
UNIQUE IN CALIFORNIA AND MANY OF

01:29:27.328 --> 01:29:29.030
THEM HAVE THEIR OWN RESOURCES I

01:29:29.097 --> 01:29:30.832
BELIEVE THAT THE TRINIDAD

01:29:30.898 --> 01:29:33.267
RANCHERIA WERE JACQUI WORKS. IS

01:29:33.334 --> 01:29:35.737
ONE THAT HAS ITS OWN FAULTS AND

01:29:35.803 --> 01:29:37.572
SO THEY WANTED TO WORK WITH THE

01:29:37.638 --> 01:29:39.207
DEPARTMENT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

01:29:39.273 --> 01:29:42.043
ENFORCE JOINT AND POWER JACKIE

01:29:42.110 --> 01:29:43.377
IS INSTRUMENTAL IN THE

01:29:43.444 --> 01:29:44.812
DISCUSSION ON A POTENTIAL

01:29:44.879 --> 01:29:46.881
AGREEMENT ON WHAT CO MANAGEMENT

01:29:46.948 --> 01:29:48.382
REALLY IS TO REPRESENT THE

01:29:48.449 --> 01:29:49.484
ASSETS THAT COME FROM THE

01:29:49.550 --> 01:29:52.720
TRIBES. AND PUT THEM WITH OF THE

01:29:52.787 --> 01:29:54.756
ASSETS OF THE STATE AND IN A

01:29:54.822 --> 01:29:56.691
COOPERATIVE WAY MOVE AHEAD ON

01:29:56.758 --> 01:29:59.861
MARINE PROTECTION. AND SO IT IS

01:29:59.927 --> 01:30:02.697
AN AMAZING THING AND SAMANTHA

01:30:02.764 --> 01:30:04.065
MARIE WAS AT ALMOST ALL THOSE

01:30:04.132 --> 01:30:07.435

01:30:11.239 --> 01:30:13.407
DEPARTMENT I DEBATED SAYING THIS

01:30:13.474 --> 01:30:14.809
BECAUSE I KNOW IT MIGHT BE

01:30:14.876 --> 01:30:15.910
CONTROVERSIAL. AMONG CERTAIN

01:30:15.977 --> 01:30:16.878
PARTIES THERE ARE MORE

01:30:16.944 --> 01:30:18.246

01:30:36.697 --> 01:30:38.032
THINGS AS THE WITNESSES WE JUST

01:30:38.099 --> 01:30:39.867

MIDDLE ON THOSE APPOINTMENTS AND

01:30:42.203 --> 01:30:44.639

ABSOLUTELY- SO WITH. AS I

01:40:27.287 --> 01:40:28.255
MENTIONED IN MY OPENING I'VE

01:40:28.322 --> 01:40:29.189
BEEN WITH THE DEPARTMENT FOR

01:40:29.256 --> 01:40:31.358
OVER TWENTY FOUR YEARS I THINK

01:40:31.425 --> 01:40:34.061
I'VE SEEN A LOT OF CHANGE- EVEN

01:40:34.128 --> 01:40:36.730
WITH THAT OUR CULTURE AS WELL- I

01:40:36.797 --> 01:40:38.665
THINK THAT WHAT COMES. WHAT

01:40:38.732 --> 01:40:41.402
REALLY IS- COMES TO MIND IS THE

01:40:41.468 --> 01:40:43.337
LEADERSHIP MAKING SURE THAT WE

01:40:43.404 --> 01:40:47.040
ARE- COMMITTED TO MAKING CHANGES

01:40:47.107 --> 01:40:48.742
OR COMMITTED TO LISTENING TO

01:40:48.809 --> 01:40:50.911
WHAT IS GOING ON. WHAT I FOUND

01:40:50.978 --> 01:40:53.046
MOST USEFUL WAS GOING OUT TO THE

01:40:53.113 --> 01:40:54.415
INSTITUTIONS MEETING WITH THE

01:40:54.481 --> 01:40:56.383
STAFF AND TALKING TO THEM AND

01:40:56.450 --> 01:40:58.619
SEEING WHAT CAN WHAT CAN WE DO

01:40:58.685 --> 01:41:00.254
TO HELP WITH THIS CHANGE. AND

01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:01.588
GAINING THE TRUST OF OUR

01:41:01.655 --> 01:41:03.824
EMPLOYEES BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S

01:41:03.891 --> 01:41:05.225
ONE THING THAT NOT ALL-

01:41:05.292 --> 01:41:07.227
EVERYBODY IS BEING LISTENED TO

01:41:07.294 --> 01:41:09.296
IN SOME REGARDS BECAUSE WE ARE

01:41:09.363 --> 01:41:10.764
MOVING SOMETIMES REALLY QUICKLY

01:41:10.831 --> 01:41:12.599
AND THAT'S NOT AN EXCUSE. BUT

01:41:12.666 --> 01:41:14.201
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO

01:41:14.268 --> 01:41:16.136
DO AS LEADERS TO ENSURE THAT THE

01:41:16.203 --> 01:41:18.338
MESSAGING. IS REACHING ALL OF

01:41:18.405 --> 01:41:20.507
OUR SUPERVISORS MANAGERS AND OUR

01:41:20.574 --> 01:41:22.376
STOP IN ENSURING THAT WE'RE

01:41:22.443 --> 01:41:25.212
EDUCATING OUR STOCK ALSO ON THE

01:41:25.279 --> 01:41:27.080
RESOURCES AVAILABLE AND WHAT

01:41:27.147 --> 01:41:28.549
AVENUES THERE ARE FOR THEM TO

01:41:28.615 --> 01:41:30.217
TAKE IF THEY FEEL. THAT THEY

01:41:30.284 --> 01:41:32.119
NEED TO- YOU TAKE IT TO THAT

01:41:32.186 --> 01:41:34.688
LEVEL BUT AGAIN I THINK THE IT

01:41:34.755 --> 01:41:36.190
GETS BACK TO THE COMMUNICATION

01:41:36.256 --> 01:41:38.358
AND THIS IS SOMETHING WE TALKED

01:41:38.425 --> 01:41:38.959
ABOUT YESTERDAY IN.

01:41:39.026 --> 01:41:40.160
COMMUNICATION WITH ALL THE

01:41:40.227 --> 01:41:41.995
PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING THE WORK

01:41:42.062 --> 01:41:43.397
EVERY DAY WE SHOULD BE MAKING

01:41:43.464 --> 01:41:44.932
THE DECISIONS JUST BASED ON

01:41:44.998 --> 01:41:46.333
SITTING IN OUR OFFICES WE SHOULD

01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:47.634
BE GETTING OUT THERE LISTENING

01:41:47.701 --> 01:41:49.870
TO WHAT'S HAPPENING. AND I KNOW

01:41:49.937 --> 01:41:50.938
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING AND

01:41:51.004 --> 01:41:52.406
THERE ARE CERTAIN THERE ARE

01:41:52.473 --> 01:41:54.475
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE HAPPENING

01:41:54.541 --> 01:41:56.477
THAT- WE DEFINITELY NEED TO

01:41:56.543 --> 01:41:58.479
ADDRESS AND WHEN WE DO NOT

01:41:58.545 --> 01:42:00.047
PEOPLE ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR

01:42:00.113 --> 01:42:02.149
THOSE ALL THOSE THINGS. WE

01:42:02.216 --> 01:42:03.951
TALKED A LOT ABOUT TRADING AS

01:42:04.017 --> 01:42:05.085
WELL. I ALWAYS USE HAVE SPENT A

01:42:05.152 --> 01:42:07.788
LOT OF MY TIME IN TRAINING AND

01:42:07.855 --> 01:42:09.089
YOU KNOW SOMETIMES WE THROW

01:42:09.156 --> 01:42:10.424
TRAINING OUT IF THERE'S AN ISSUE

01:42:10.491 --> 01:42:12.059
LET'S JUST TRAIN PEOPLE BUT

01:42:12.125 --> 01:42:14.394
THERE HAS TO BE MORE TO JUST THE

01:42:14.461 --> 01:42:16.330
TRAINING PIECE. I THINK TRAINING

01:42:16.396 --> 01:42:18.432
IS VERY CRITICAL AND ENSURING

01:42:18.499 --> 01:42:19.900
THAT PEOPLE HAVE THE RESOURCES

01:42:19.967 --> 01:42:25.305
AGAIN. AND EDUCATION OF WHAT IS

01:42:25.372 --> 01:42:26.507
GOING ON AND FOR US YOU CAN DO

01:42:26.573 --> 01:42:27.407

01:42:27.474 --> 01:42:28.609
FROM OUR POSITIONS IT AS THE

01:42:28.675 --> 01:42:30.577
LEADERS. SO I DEFINITELY THINK

01:42:30.644 --> 01:42:31.979
THAT SOMETHING WALKEN'S WE'VE I

01:42:32.045 --> 01:42:33.981
DON'T THINK SORRY. IT IS

01:42:34.047 --> 01:42:35.115
SOMETHING THAT WILL CONTINUE TO

01:42:35.182 --> 01:42:37.784
DO- AS MOVING FORWARD BUT I WILL

01:42:37.851 --> 01:42:40.654
SAY. THAT I DO SEE A LOT OF

01:42:40.721 --> 01:42:42.322
PROGRESS OVER THE YEARS THAT

01:42:42.389 --> 01:42:44.224
I'VE BEEN HERE. AND THAT GIVES

01:42:44.291 --> 01:42:46.360
ME- THANK AS WE HOPE AS WELL

01:42:46.426 --> 01:42:49.396
THAT WE WILL EVENTUALLY GET TO

01:42:49.463 --> 01:42:51.164
WHERE WE NEED TO BE. THANK YOU

01:42:51.231 --> 01:42:54.201
FOR THAT M. AND I THINK GIVEN

01:42:54.268 --> 01:42:55.802
THE FACT WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT

01:42:55.869 --> 01:42:59.339
NON CUSTODIAL STAFF RIGHT HOW WE

01:42:59.406 --> 01:43:01.642
CAN RETAIN RECRUIT AND RETAIN

01:43:01.708 --> 01:43:03.610
FOLKS YOU KNOW AS COOKS AND

01:43:03.677 --> 01:43:06.179
JANITORS AN ADMIN YOU KNOW THAT

01:43:06.246 --> 01:43:08.549
BEING ABLE TO RETAIN RECRUIT AND

01:43:08.615 --> 01:43:10.751
RETAIN THOSE POSITIONS. ARE

01:43:10.817 --> 01:43:13.854
SUCCESSFULLY WILL REQUIRE

01:43:13.921 --> 01:43:15.022
ADDITIONAL FOCUS ON THE

01:43:15.088 --> 01:43:17.357
CUSTODIAL STAFF RIGHT IN MAKING

01:43:17.424 --> 01:43:20.761
SURE THAT THEY FEEL- SUPPORTED

01:43:23.997 --> 01:43:25.432
OF GOES BOTH WAYS SO I KNOW WHAT

01:43:25.499 --> 01:43:27.134
I'M NOT GONNA ASK ABOUT THE

01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:29.670
OTHER ONE BUT- IT'S THE CYCLE OF

01:43:29.736 --> 01:43:33.840
LIFE. I'M MISS MONTGOMERY I

01:43:33.907 --> 01:43:34.975
WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON A

01:43:35.042 --> 01:43:37.911
DISCUSSION THAT WE HAD- THE

01:43:37.978 --> 01:43:39.279
OTHER DAY AS WELL I THINK I'D

01:43:39.346 --> 01:43:42.149
ASK YOU ABOUT. CBSA THE COMPUTER

01:43:42.215 --> 01:43:46.520
VOICE STRESS ANALYZER- AND SO

01:43:46.587 --> 01:43:48.255
THE CLARIFICATION THAT I GOT IS

01:43:48.322 --> 01:43:49.923
THAT CVS SAY IS INTENDED TO

01:43:49.990 --> 01:43:51.525
SUPPORT INVESTIGATIONS INTO

01:43:51.592 --> 01:43:53.493
THREAT ASSESSMENTS IN OUR

01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:57.564
INSTITUTIONS- IT'S SO IT'S BEING

01:43:57.631 --> 01:44:00.300
UTILIZED. ARM AND I KNOW YOU

01:44:00.367 --> 01:44:02.502
SAID IN YOUR INTRODUCTION THAT

01:44:02.569 --> 01:44:04.137
YOU DON'T CREATE THE POLICY BUT

01:44:04.204 --> 01:44:05.038
YOU'RE CERTAINLY IMPLEMENTING

01:44:05.105 --> 01:44:07.674
OPERATIONAL ISING IT AND I DO

01:44:07.741 --> 01:44:11.244
RECOGNIZE THE DIFFERENCE- BUT

01:44:11.311 --> 01:44:15.949
GIVEN THAT. CVS SAY- TENDS TO

01:44:16.016 --> 01:44:17.918
PRODUCE FALSE OR COMPROMISE

01:44:17.985 --> 01:44:20.287
REPORTS IT HAS AN ACCURACY RATE

01:44:20.354 --> 01:44:23.256
OF ABOUT 8% YOU KNOW I'M

01:44:23.323 --> 01:44:25.392
WONDERING YOUR THOUGHTS ON. WHY

01:44:25.459 --> 01:44:29.863
WE ARE USING THIS TECHNOLOGY-

01:44:29.930 --> 01:44:32.132
AND WHAT OTHER ALTERNATIVES

01:44:32.199 --> 01:44:35.135
THERE ARE FOR US. TO GET THE

01:44:35.202 --> 01:44:38.839
KIND OF INFORMATION WE NEED-

01:44:38.905 --> 01:44:40.307
INFORMATION THAT WILL BE MORE

01:44:40.374 --> 01:44:43.310
ACCURATE AND CAN PASSED STRESS

01:44:43.377 --> 01:44:46.713
TESTS. WHEN IT COMES TO BEING

01:44:46.780 --> 01:44:48.348
CREDIBLE. BECAUSE I THINK 8%

01:44:48.415 --> 01:44:51.752
ACCURACY IS KIND OF LOW. THANK

01:44:51.818 --> 01:44:54.888

01:44:54.955 --> 01:44:58.191
ACTUALLY- FALLS OUT OF FALLS

01:44:58.258 --> 01:44:59.626
OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF MY ROLE

01:44:59.693 --> 01:45:01.395
WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT- AND I CAN

01:45:01.461 --> 01:45:02.829
CERTAINLY PUT YOU IN TOUCH WITH

01:45:02.896 --> 01:45:04.464
THE PEOPLE THAT CAN ANSWER THAT

01:45:04.531 --> 01:45:07.200
QUESTION- IT AS A- TALK ABOUT

01:45:07.267 --> 01:45:08.435
SHOULD SHOULD THE PROGRAM NEEDS

01:45:08.502 --> 01:45:10.704
THIS TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY. BUT WE

01:45:10.771 --> 01:45:11.938
REALLY DO IS LOOK AT WITH THAT

01:45:12.005 --> 01:45:15.542
WORK WITH THE PROGRAMS TO- GET

01:45:15.609 --> 01:45:17.210
THE LOOK AT THE PROCUREMENT

01:45:17.277 --> 01:45:19.179
TRYING TO WORK WITH THEM ON

01:45:19.246 --> 01:45:20.213
IMPLEMENTING THE TECHNOLOGY

01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:21.882
BASED ON THE POLICY BASED ON THE

01:45:21.948 --> 01:45:23.517
REGULATIONS THAT YOU TALK ABOUT

01:45:23.583 --> 01:45:25.886
ANY PROCEDURES DIVIDE. DEFINED

01:45:25.952 --> 01:45:31.625
BY THEM- SO- WITH THAT- I CAN

01:45:31.692 --> 01:45:33.193
CERTAINLY PUT THEM IN TOUCH WITH

01:45:33.260 --> 01:45:34.161
SOMEBODY IN TOUCH WITH YOU TO

01:45:34.227 --> 01:45:35.595
THAT QUESTION. WELL THAT WOULD

01:45:35.662 --> 01:45:37.497
BE GREAT BUT I GUESS IF THE IDEA

01:45:37.564 --> 01:45:41.802
IS TO. BE ABLE TO. ASSESS

01:45:41.868 --> 01:45:45.572
THREATS. WHICH IS A POLICY HOW

01:45:45.639 --> 01:45:47.507
DO WE DO THIS THEN SOMEONE MADE

01:45:47.574 --> 01:45:50.644
A DECISION TO PROCURE THIS KIND

01:45:50.711 --> 01:45:52.846
OF SOFTWARE OR EQUIPMENT. AND

01:45:52.913 --> 01:45:54.781
WHO'S THE ONE WHO SAYS HEY

01:45:54.848 --> 01:45:57.084
PEOPLE. WE DON'T GET GREAT

01:45:57.150 --> 01:45:59.553
RESULTS LET'S NOT- YOU KNOW

01:45:59.619 --> 01:46:01.521
IMPLEMENT THIS I MEAN THAT'S HOW

01:46:01.588 --> 01:46:02.923
I GET OF ADS AND SO I'M NOT

01:46:02.989 --> 01:46:04.825
GOING TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT. IF

01:46:04.891 --> 01:46:06.460
THAT'S NOT YOU I GUESS WHO IS IT

01:46:06.526 --> 01:46:07.494
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THAT IT

01:46:07.561 --> 01:46:08.762
MAKES SENSE FOR US TO BE

01:46:08.829 --> 01:46:11.431
IMPLEMENTING SOFTWARE THAT COSTS

01:46:11.498 --> 01:46:12.666
A LOT THAT ISN'T PRODUCING THE

01:46:12.733 --> 01:46:14.935
KIND OF RESULTS THAT WE WANT TO

01:46:15.001 --> 01:46:17.404
GET IN ULTIMATELY THE RESULTS WE

01:46:17.471 --> 01:46:18.872
WANT TO GET. ARE ACCURATE

01:46:18.939 --> 01:46:23.610
RESULTS. YOU MIGHT MATH YES THE

01:46:23.677 --> 01:46:25.746
AND AGAIN I THINK- I WOULD LOOK

PROGRAM AREAS YOU JERK DIFFERENT

01:46:34.721 --> 01:46:36.923
TOOLS AND I THINK THAT THEY CAN

01:46:36.990 --> 01:46:37.657
THEY WOULD BE BEST TO ANSWER

01:46:37.724 --> 01:46:40.961
THE- THE OUTCOME OF THESE TOOLS

01:46:41.027 --> 01:46:42.596
AGAIN WE JUST HELP WITH MORE THE

01:46:42.662 --> 01:46:44.231
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TECHNOLOGY

01:46:44.297 --> 01:46:48.135
IN THE PROCUREMENT. THANK YOU

APPLICATIONS FOR OFFICERS HAS

01:50:10.637 --> 01:50:13.106
DROPPED SIGNIFICANTLY. I THINK

01:50:13.173 --> 01:50:15.508
40% YEAR OVER YEAR AND NOW 50%

01:50:15.575 --> 01:50:17.544
WHEN COMPARED SHOT OVER THE LAST

01:50:17.610 --> 01:50:19.145
TWO YEARS CERTAINLY CORBIN MIGHT

01:50:19.212 --> 01:50:20.847
HAVE PLAYED A ROLE IN PERHAPS A

01:50:20.914 --> 01:50:22.916
PRISON CLOSURES OR PLAYING A

01:50:27.220 --> 01:50:28.355
STEPPING FORWARD TO GET INTO

01:50:28.421 --> 01:50:29.990
THIS PROFESSION. BUT I KNOW YOU

01:50:30.056 --> 01:50:31.691
MENTIONED THAT THERE WERE FIVE

01:50:31.758 --> 01:50:33.059
WAYS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING OUT TO

01:50:33.126 --> 01:50:36.229
RECRUIT MORE OFFICERS AND ALSO

01:50:36.296 --> 01:50:38.365
ADDRESS THE DIVERSITY ISSUE AND

01:50:38.431 --> 01:50:40.100
I THINK THAT WILL SPECIFICALLY

THAT THAT'S PROBABLY DIFFICULT

01:50:46.673 --> 01:50:48.508
ESPECIALLY WITH YOU KNOW THE

01:50:48.575 --> 01:50:50.276
SITUATION THAT WE HAVE WITH THE

01:50:50.343 --> 01:50:51.678
PANDEMIC AND THE ABILITY TO

01:50:51.745 --> 01:50:53.146

01:51:00.620 --> 01:51:02.122

THIRTY THOUSAND APPLICATIONS

01:51:53.373 --> 01:51:55.942
THAT WERE IN PROCESS WE DID SEE

01:51:56.009 --> 01:51:58.611

01:53:16.956 --> 01:53:18.658
YOU KNOW THE WHOLE WORLD. AND SO

01:53:18.725 --> 01:53:21.361
TRYING TO DO VIRTUAL FARES AND-

01:53:21.427 --> 01:53:23.730
GET PEOPLE TO COME- HAS BEEN

01:53:23.796 --> 01:53:25.665
CHALLENGING BUT THEY CONTINUE TO

01:53:25.732 --> 01:53:27.800
GET MORE APPLICATIONS. AND IT'S

01:53:27.867 --> 01:53:29.302
INTERESTING BECAUSE WE TYPICALLY

01:53:29.369 --> 01:53:30.670
SEE A DECLINE AROUND THE

01:53:30.737 --> 01:53:32.772
HOLIDAYS AND THEN THE NUMBERS

01:53:32.839 --> 01:53:35.175
INCREASE- AFTER IT USUALLY IN

01:53:35.241 --> 01:53:37.744
JANUARY FEBRUARY. WE ACTUALLY

01:53:37.810 --> 01:53:39.979
SAW AN INCREASE IN DECEMBER. AND

01:53:40.046 --> 01:53:42.482
SO NOT QUITE SURE WHY BUT WE DID

01:53:42.549 --> 01:53:43.850
SEE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE ONE

01:53:43.917 --> 01:53:44.851
OF THE PROBABLY ONE OF THE

01:53:44.918 --> 01:53:46.052
BIGGEST WE'VE SEEN IN PROBABLY A

01:53:46.119 --> 01:53:48.588
YEAR AND A HALF- I WILL SAY

01:53:48.655 --> 01:53:49.789
THOUGH THE RECRUITMENT HAS BEEN

01:53:49.856 --> 01:53:51.758
VERY SUCCESSFUL AS FAR OUT AS WE

01:53:51.824 --> 01:53:55.328
HAVE. MAINTAINED THE ACADEMY- WE

01:53:55.395 --> 01:53:58.097
FILL THE ACADEMY EVERY- CHANCE

01:53:58.164 --> 01:53:59.432
THAT WE GET WE HAVE NOT HAD A

01:53:59.499 --> 01:54:01.067
TIME WHERE WE DID NOT HAVE

THE ECONOMY AND WE CONTINUE TO

01:54:05.505 --> 01:54:07.407
INCREASE OUR NUMBERS OF FEMALES.

01:54:07.473 --> 01:54:09.442
IT IS DIFFICULT AT TIMES TO GET

01:54:09.509 --> 01:54:10.443
THE EMAILS AND WE HAD REACHED

01:54:10.510 --> 01:54:12.111
OUT. TO A NUMBER OF OUR

01:54:12.178 --> 01:54:14.714
APPLICANTS AND PARTLY BECAUSE WE

01:54:14.781 --> 01:54:15.848
HAVE ONE ACADEMY THAT'S

01:54:15.915 --> 01:54:18.084
AVAILABLE AND ITS SINGLES SO IT

01:54:18.151 --> 01:54:21.454

01:54:23.022 --> 01:54:24.657
DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO BE AWAY

FROM THEIR FAMILIES FOR THIRTEEN

01:54:25.625 --> 01:54:27.894

01:54:49.849 --> 01:54:50.850

PAST IT'S CALLED THE ONE STOP

01:55:01.694 --> 01:55:04.197
HIRING. AND IN THOSE HARD TO

01:55:04.264 --> 01:55:06.065

PROCESS RIGHT THERE THAT THEY

01:55:27.487 --> 01:55:29.355
CAN ACCOMMODATE PEOPLE. BECAUSE

01:55:29.422 --> 01:55:30.823
ANOTHER CHALLENGE WE WOULD GET

01:55:30.890 --> 01:55:32.692
WAS BIG THAT PEOPLE COULDN'T

01:55:32.759 --> 01:55:34.794
TRAVEL TO CERTAIN AREAS AND- WE

01:55:34.861 --> 01:55:36.362

02:00:24.750 --> 02:00:26.485
OF YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT IF YOU

02:00:26.552 --> 02:00:28.087
HAVE THE INFORMATION I KNOW THAT

02:00:28.154 --> 02:00:30.723
IT WAS SOMETHING OF- PRETTY

02:00:30.790 --> 02:00:32.158
SIGNIFICANT CONCERN IN THE IN

02:00:32.224 --> 02:00:35.494
OUR LAST DISCUSSIONS ON ON THIS

02:00:35.561 --> 02:00:37.263
BUDGET APPROPRIATION. THANK

02:00:37.330 --> 02:00:39.332
SENATOR- YES WE HAVE JUST

02:00:39.398 --> 02:00:41.233
STARTED- WORKING ON THIS-

02:00:41.300 --> 02:00:43.903
PROJECT AND- I FIND IT VERY

02:00:43.970 --> 02:00:46.939
EXCITING- THE FIRST THING THAT

02:00:47.006 --> 02:00:49.775
WE- ARE ARE DOING IT IS REALLY

02:00:49.842 --> 02:00:51.410
LOOKING AT OUR INFRASTRUCTURE

02:00:51.477 --> 02:00:53.212
AND SO I TALK ABOUT THAT IT'S

02:00:53.279 --> 02:00:56.849
REALLY ARE- THE NETWORK. AND THE

02:00:56.916 --> 02:00:58.517
SERVERS AND EVERYTHING THAT

02:00:58.584 --> 02:01:00.453
SUPPORTS THE UNDERLYING-

02:01:00.519 --> 02:01:03.356
LAPTOPS. SO THE REASON WHY

02:01:03.422 --> 02:01:04.824
THAT'S SO IMPORTANT TO THIS ONE

02:01:04.890 --> 02:01:06.392
AS YOU- WHEN YOU ARE GOING TO

02:01:06.459 --> 02:01:07.660
GET THAT MANY LAPTOPS I YOU

02:01:07.727 --> 02:01:09.028
FIRST HAVE TO HAVE A BAND WITH

02:01:09.095 --> 02:01:10.529
BECAUSE THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO

02:01:10.596 --> 02:01:12.898
ACCESS THE INFORMATION- AND

02:01:12.965 --> 02:01:14.600
SECONDLY WE ARE LOOKING AT THE

02:01:14.667 --> 02:01:15.601
SECURITY COMPONENTS THAT YOU'RE

02:01:15.668 --> 02:01:17.670
TALKING ABOUT. THE GROUND AND IT

02:01:17.737 --> 02:01:19.271
WOULD BE SEPARATE SO THE INPUT

02:01:19.338 --> 02:01:21.273
WE CALL INCARCERATED NETWORK

02:01:21.340 --> 02:01:22.441
VERSES ARE STAFFED WITH THAT

02:01:22.508 --> 02:01:24.210
HAVE A TOTALLY SEPARATED IT SO

02:01:24.276 --> 02:01:26.112
THAT- WE MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN

02:01:26.178 --> 02:01:27.279
MONITOR IT FROM THAT STANDPOINT

02:01:27.346 --> 02:01:29.915

ARE PUTTING A LEARNING

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:49.902
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SO THAT'S

02:01:49.969 --> 02:01:51.570
REALLY HOW THEY'RE ACESSING THE

02:01:51.637 --> 02:01:53.939
