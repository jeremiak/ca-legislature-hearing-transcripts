AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS PREPARING TO MAKE A PRESENTATION THAT THERE ARE A SERIES OF AMENDMENTS THAT WERE ADDED TO THIS BILL ALL READ THEM FOR THE RECORD- FIRST OF THE TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS TO ENSURE CCA PARTICIPATION IS LIMITED. TO THE BIO MAT PROGRAM TO INSURERS FOR CPUC OVERSIGHT OF CCA PARTICIPATION AND BIO MAT INCLUDING PRUDENCE THE REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF CCA BY MATT CONTRACTS. AND THIRD STRIKING SPECIFIC CPUC DECISIONS. FROM LANGUAGE TO ALLOW CPUC IMPLEMENTATION FLEXIBILITY. IF YOU WOULD BE KIND ENOUGH TO BEGIN YOUR PRESENTATION AND LET US KNOW YOUR- POSITION ON THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS SURE. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS FIRST AND FOREMOST THANK YOU FOR THE THAT TO THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS DRAFTED. AB EIGHT FORTY THREE IS A NARROW BILL AIM TO ALLOW COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS OR CCA'S TO ACCESS ANY. EXTRA SEASON TO EXIST. AN EXISTING STATE PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES COST RECOVERY FOR RENEWABLE BIO ENERGY ELECTRICITY PROJECTS INCLUDING BIOMASS AND BIOGAS. AB EIGHT FORTY THREE DOES NOT PROPOSE ANY STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO THE EXISTING BIO ENERGY PROGRAM AND ALLOWS FOR SIMILAR REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OF THE PROGRAM WITH THE NEW APPLICANTS AS CURRENTLY ADMINISTERED. WHICH IS FURTHER CLARIFIED IN THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. ALL CCAA PROCUREMENT AND CONTRACTS INTO THE BY MATT PROGRAM WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME OVERSIGHT AND COST RECOVERY TERMS AS INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES OR I'LL USE CONTRACTS. I KNOW THIS IS I KNOW THIS IS A MAIN CONCERN OF OUR LABOR PARTNERS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE WE'VE ADDRESSED THEIR WISH FOR PARITY IN THIS AREA. THE BILL ADDRESSES P. YOU SEE OVERSIGHT EXPLICITLY REQUIRING PARALLEL PROGRAM TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT ONLY ALLOWS. PROCUREMENT OF ELIGIBLE PROJECTS. CURRENTLY ONLY I'LL USE ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THE BIO MAT PROGRAM AND THERE IS AVAILABLE CAPACITY REMAINING UNDER THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MEGAWATT CAP SET IN STATUTE. THIS BILL DOES NOT LIFT THAT CAP NOR MANDATE ADDITIONAL PROCUREMENT OF BIOENERGY. BECAUSE CCA CUSTOMERS ARE PAYING FOR THESE PROJECTS THEY SHOULD BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THEIR OWN PROCUREMENTIN A WAY THAT MAKES SENSE FOR COMMUNITIES AND THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH STATE POLICY. ADDITIONALLY THE CPUS MOST RECENT REVIEW THE BY MAIL PROGRAM ENERGY DIVISION STAFF RECOMMENDED THAT CCA'S AMONG OTHERS. HE PERMITTED TO PROCURE AND RECOVER COSTS FOR THE BY MAP PROGRAM. THE BY MAP PROGRAM WAS CREATED BY THE LEGISLATOR- PRIOR TO THE WIDESPREAD ADOPTION OF CCA'S OF THIS BILL REFLECTS THE CURRENT PROCUREMENT LANDSCAPE OF THE STATE. BY BETTER UTILIZING THE BIO MAT PROGRAM AB EIGHT FORTY THREE WILL PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR RESPONSIBLE FOREST AND AGRICULTURAL LAND MANAGEMENT. AS WELL AS PROVIDING POTENTIAL RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES FOR MICROGRID AND OTHER BACKUP ENERGY PROJECTS. WITH ME TO TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF OUR SAM CANE THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF PIONEER ENERGY AND TIM FLANAGAN THE GENERAL MANAGER OF MODERATE REGIONAL WASTE MANAGEMENT DISTRICT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION FOR MODERATOR CAN YOU- ALERT MISTER SAM KING- WITH PIONEER COMMUNITY ENERGY THAT. HE IS TO PROCEED WITH THIS TESTIMONY. BLINDED OPENED THEIR. THANK YOU A GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR HOLDEN BY CHURCH PATTERSON AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS SAM TANGO NINE TO CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER PONDERED COMMITTEE ENERGY PIONEERS A COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS SERVING ELECTRICITY CUSTOMERS IN PLASTER COUNTY AND NOW DO YOU ALL DRAW TO COUNTY TWENTY TWENTY TWO FOR A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND ACCOUNTS AND ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION MEGAWATT HOURS OF ELECTRICITY. LASSEN COUNTY HAD SEVERAL BY MASS PROJECTS IN OPERATION AND PIETERS WORKING DEVELOPERS. TO ADD MORE AS ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE. I THINK I WOULD AFTER TO BY MASS. THAT JUST COST THE SUPPLYING FOR TWO MAIN REASONS. FIRST BEING AT THE FOOTHILLS OF THE SIERRA. WILDFIRE MITIGATION THROUGH SUSTAINABLE FOREST MANAGEMENT USING BIOMASS PROJECTS. WHICH BY THE WAY CREATING BASELOAD ELECTRICITY CAPACITY. IN A SEVERELY CONSTRAINED MARKET IS CRITICAL NOT ONLY FOR PIONEER. BUT FOR ALL CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. ADDITIONALLY IN TWENTY TWENTY ALONE PLASTERED EL DORADO COUNTY CENTER SIX PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT UP YOU THAT. WITH AVERAGE DURATIONS RANGING FROM. NINETY TO FORTY THREE HOURS ALMOST TWO DAYS. USING BY MATT PROJECT PERSON HORSEMAN WITH REDUCE WILDFIRES AND HOPEFULLY ONE DAY ELIMINATE PS PSP BUT ALL TOGETHER. SECONDS THE DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL BIOMASS PROJECT WILL HELP STIMULATE THE LOCAL ECONOMY THROUGH THE CREATION OF LOCAL JOBS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED BENEFITS. THE FINAL POINT OF LIKE TO REITERATE AGAIN IS THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT CREATE ANY ADDITIONAL COST IMPACT AN EXISTING CPUC BY MATT PROGRAM. THAT DOES NOT EXPAND THE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS. ALL REPAIRS SUBDIVIDE THE BY MATT PROGRAM YEAH ALL THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES HAVE ACCESS TO THE PROGRAM. IS THAT THE STATED EIGHTY EIGHT FORTY THREE WOULD PROVIDE COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS ACCESS TO A PROGRAM THAT YOU'RE ALREADY PAYING FOR YEAH DO NOT RECEIVE ANY BENEFITS FROM. THANK YOU TERRY HOLDEN BUT YOU'RE PATTERSON CAN BE MEMBERS FOR YOUR TIME I URGE YOU TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF EIGHTY EIGHT FORTY THREE. THANK YOU WE APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY FOR MODERATOR PLEASE ALERT TIM FLANAGAN- THAT HE MAY PROCEED WITH HIS TESTIMONY. YES THE CHAIR YOUR LINE IS OPEN SIR. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON HOLDEN VICE CHAIR PATTERSON MEMBERS OF THE UTILITIES AND ENERGY COMMITTEE MY NAME'S TIM FLANAGAN I'M THE GENERAL MANAGER OF THE MONTEREY REGIONAL WASTE MANAGEMENT DISTRICT WE STRONGLY SUPPORT AB FORTY THREE. EIGHT FORTY THREE WE ARE REGIONAL- JURISDICTION SERVING RURAL COUNTIES IN MONTEREY SAN BENITO AND SANTA CRUZ. OUR DISTRICT'S MISSION IS TO CONVERT THAT WASTE INTO RESOURCES AND COST EFFECTIVE ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND MANNER. WE WERE ONE OF THE FIRST IN THE NATION TO DEVELOP LANDFILL GAS TO ENERGY SYSTEMS ALMOST FORTY YEARS AGO IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE. TEMPTATION ON SOLID WASTE AUTHORITIES LIKE OURSELVES ARE REQUIRED TO DIVERT. UP 275% OF ITS SOLID LEADS AGAIN UNTIL BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN CITIES COUNTY WELL THIS OBLIGATION TO PROCURE RECYCLE MATERIAL. RIGHT NOW THE HIGH COST OF BIOMASS CONVERSION SIGNIFICANTLY HAMPERS SOLID WASTE AUTHORITY AND SANITATION DISTRICT FROM PURSUING NEW BIOENERGY PROJECTS THAT COULD HELP DIVERT HARMFUL. OR SOLID ORGANIC WASTE WHILE PROVIDING A BASELINE POWER TO OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATOR MERELY BECAUSE THE LEGISLATION BEHIND THEIR STATES BY A MAP REPAIR. DOES NOT EXPRESSLY NAMED CCA'S OF THE BIO MAT PARTICIPANT DESPITE THE CPUC SAYING ALL RATE PAYERS PAY FOR THE COSTS OF THE PROGRAM. OUR MEMBERS IN OUR JURISDICTION THERE ARE RATE PAYERS WOULD BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT PROGRAM. IF YOU'RE APPROVED. EIGHTY EIGHT FORTY THREE. LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES AGENCIES LIKE OUR OWN BIOENERGY PROJECTS REPRESENT A PATH FORWARD TO ADDRESS THE REGULATORY AND COMMUNITY GOALS OF REDUCING SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS INCLUDING METHANE AND BLACK CARBON. THIS RENEWABLE ENERGY FURTHER PROVIDE OTHER KEY INITIATIVES SO MICROGRID FOR MEANINGFUL SOLID WASTE AND WASTEWATER FACILITY IN FACT WE ARE CALLED JOINED WITH THE WASTEWATER FACILITY NEXT DOOR TO US THIS WOULD BE THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THOSE COMBINED SO THAT WE COULD USE OUR RENEWABLE ENERGY. TO MAKE RENEWABLE WATER FOR OUR NEIGHBOR NEXT DOOR. PMR W. COMBO PROGRAM THAT HELP OUR CITY AND COUNTIES AND LIKE WHY MEET THE STATE MANDATED ORGANIC WASTE CALM. REDUCTION CON TARGETS THEY ARE ONLY ONE COMPONENT OF THE COMPLIANCE PATHWAY IN THE END PRODUCT IS NOT ALWAYS APPROPRIATE FOR OUR NEEDS OF OUR SIGNIFICANT AGRICULTURAL BATES. YEAH WE ARE AMERICANS VALIDATES AND ME AND MY- SELL AGENCY ACROSS THE RIVER ARE EXPRESSLY IN ENCOURAGED TO SEE THE PASSAGE OF THIS. LEGISLATION TO ENABLE IT STUDENT PERFORMED- SOLID WASTE TO POWER TO COMBINED HEAT AND POWER SYSTEM. WE WANT TO THANK YOU- SHAREHOLDING VICE CHAIR PATTERSON AND MEMBER OF COMMITTEES FOR YOUR TIME WE STRONGLY UGE YOU IN FAVOR OF VOTING FOR EIGHTY EIGHT FORTY THREE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WE NOW HAVE TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION PHONE MODERATOR IF YOU COULD ALERT RACHEL COSTS- THAT SHE CAN PROCEED WITH HER TESTIMONY. YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON HONORABLE COMMITTEE MEMBERS RACHEL COSTS IN BEHALF OF THE COALITION OF CALIFORNIA UTILITY EMPLOYEES WE HAD TAKEN IN OPPOSE POSITION TO EIGHT AB EIGHT FORTY THREE WHICH WILL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THERAPY FABLESS MEN ALLOW HE FEES TO RECOVER THEIR PROCUREMENT COSTS FROM NON CPA CUSTOMERS. WE WILL REVISIT OUR POSITION AFTER REVIEWING THE AMENDMENT TAKEN TODAY AND WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HER WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU- PHONE MODERATOR JAMIE **** **** IS NEXT TO PRESENT HER TESTIMONY. YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THIS IS JAMIE **** WITH LEADERSHIP COUNSEL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY WELL BASED IN THE SAN JOAQUIN AND MISTER COACH HELP COACHELLA VALLEY WE WORK ALONGSIDE THE MOST IMPACTED COMMUNITIES TO ADVOCATE FOR SOUND POLICY IRAQI INJUSTICE TO SECURE EQUAL ACCESS OPPORTUNITY REGARDLESS OF WEALTH RACE INCOME AND PLACE. WE OPPOSED TO EIGHTY EIGHT POINT THREE BECAUSE IT SUPPORTS THE CONTINUED OPERATION AND EXPANSION OF INDUSTRIAL DAIRIES THAT POLLUTE COMMUNITIES. AND APPROACH VERY NOTHING AS RENEWABLE ENERGY WHEN IT IS IN FACT A FALSE SOLUTION TO CALIFORNIA'S NEED FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY. GENERATING JERRY METHANE REQUIRES INDUSTRIAL SCALE DAIRIES WITH THOUSANDS OF HOUSE THESE INDUSTRIAL DAIRIES NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE AIR AND WATER QUALITY OF NEARBY COMMUNITIES. WHICH ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. FURTHER THESE INDUSTRIAL THERE EITHER SIGNIFICANT SOURCES OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOT INCENTIVIZE THE OPERATION AND EXPANSION OF THE SCHOOL OF THIS POLLUTING INDUSTRY ESPECIALLY AS PART OF AN EFFORT TO REDUCE EMISSIONS. USING THE WASTE MORE POLLUTING INDUSTRY I'M CALLING IT RENEWABLE IS SIMPLY PUTTING LIPSTICK ON A COW IS A FULL SOLUTION. CALIFORNIA MUST INVEST IN TRULY RENEWABLE ENERGY HOW MUCH DO SO IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT HARM LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. WE CANNOT SUPPORT INCLUSION OF POLLUTING ENERGY PRODUCTION IN A CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE FOR THOSE REASONS WE MUST OPPOSE EIGHTY EIGHT POINT THREE. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU WE APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY. I WILL NOW MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT. DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN THE BACK OF THE CHAMBER WHICH I DO NOT SEE THAT WE DO- IN SUPPORT OPPOSITION.

YEAH THANK RESEARCHER MEMBERS WAS SERVICING THAT I WILL ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TODAY AND I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL. COMPLETELY RESENT ASSEMBLY BILL THREE TWENTY TWO WHICH WILL HELP CALIFORNIA MEET ITS CLEAN ENERGY GOALS. AND HELP US MEET WHAT KARMA CALIFORNIA RESOURCES BOARD WAS CALLING FOR WHICH WAS AN INCREASE INVESTMENT IN BIO ENERGY- FACILITIES. AB THREE TWENTY TWO HAS A WIDE COALITION OF SUPPORT- EVERYBODY FROM AIR DISTRICTS. WATER AT LEAST WATER AND WASTE WATER AGENCIES THIRTY SEVEN DIFFERENT COUNTIES THE L. A. WASTE MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE THE RENEWABLE ENERGY- GROUPS AT THE CLEAN ENERGY GROUPS AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE I DO HAVE A- TO INDIVIDUALS TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT JULIA LEVINE THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE BIOENERGY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. AND CRISTIANA DARLING TEN REPRESENTATIVE OF THE NORTHERN SONOMA COUNTY AND PLASTER COUNTY FAIR DISTRICTS. THANK YOU WILL NOTE TO OUR PHONE MODERATOR IF YOU CAN CALL ANGELA LEVIN- TO PROCEED WITH HER TESTIMONY. THEY SHARED- I DO NOT SEE HER ON THE PHONE IF YOU'RE ON THE PHONE PLEASE PRESS STAR THEN ZERO. IF SHE IS NOT ON THE ON THE LINE THEN WE CAN MOVE TO CRISTINA DARLINGTON. YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON SURE HOLDEN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS CRISTIAN AT ARLINGTON AND I AM TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF THE NORTHERN SONOMA COUNTY AND PLASTER COUNTY WHICH CONTROL DISTRICT. ARE AIR DISTRICT AND OTHER SUPPORT EIGHTY THREE TO KILL BECAUSE WILDFIRE AND OPEN BURNING OF FORESTS IN ADELAIDE ARE MAJOR SOURCES OF AIR POLLUTION IN CALIFORNIA IN MANY PARTS OF THE STATE AND BIO ENERGY OFFERS AN ALTERNATIVE PATHWAY TO THAT OPEN BURNING OR TO THE DECAY WHICH CREATES METHANE. IN THE STATE TOWARD CARBON PLAN THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY AND THE RESOURCES AGENCY WORK TOGETHER TO FIND A CALIFORNIA MUCH REDUCE EMISSIONS FROM WILDFIRES CAN MEET THE STATE'S CLIMATE AIR QUALITY GOALS BOTH OF THOSEAGENCIES IN THAT PLAN CALLS FOR INCREASED BIO ENERGY TO REDUCE THE MOST HARMFUL AIR AND CLIMATE POLLUTANTS ASSOCIATED WITH WILDFIRE WHICH ARE BLACK CARBON AND METHANE. AND OF COURSE OUR CO TWO EMISSIONS EMITTED. FROM THE FIRES AS WELL. LAUGHTER COUNTY AREA. HAS CONDUCTED SEVERAL STUDIES SHOWS PM PICULET MATT. CAN BE REDUCED BY AS MUCH AS BURNING AND WOULDN'T GET CALCULATE MATTER THERE IS A LOT OF BLACK CARBON AND BLACK CARBON IS HUNDREDS OF TIMES MORE POTENT BACKLINE FORCING AGENTS AND CO TWO ALONE. FOR THESE REASONS WE SUPPORT THE USE OF BIOENERGY BIO ENERGY ALSO CUT METHANE EMISSIONS THAT COULD RESULT FROM THE DECAY OF WOOD WASTE. AND IT ALSO REDUCES TO SOME DEGREE SMOG FORMING POLLUTANTS INCLUDING KNOX. SO THESE ARE THE REASONS THAT WE SUPPORT BIO ENERGY AND THIS BILL. ON THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICT ALSO RECOGNIZES THAT THE AIRPORT ITSELF THE CALIFORNIA RESOURCES BOARD HAS FOUND THAT- BURNING BIOMASS TO ENERGY IS FAR PREFERABLE FOR AIR QUALITY AND CLIMATE THEN THE OPENPOWER BURNING A FORCE THAT WASTE. AND THAT'S DEMONSTRATED BY THE FACT THAT THEY ARE RESOURCES BOARD CONSIDERS BIO ENERGY BE ESSENTIALLY CARBON NEUTRAL WITHIN THE STATE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM BY REDUCING SEVERAL OF ITS REQUIREMENTS FOR- BIOMASS PROJECTS TO- TO REPORT AND SO ON. SO FOR THESE REASONS WE URGE YOU TO PASS EIGHTY THREE TO TWO AND SUPPORT THAT. AFFECT PROGRAM RECOGNIZING THE VALUE OF BIO ENERGY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'M AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS OF COURSE. THANK YOU APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY PHONE. MODERATOR ISRAEL ELEVEN. OF SHE IS THE AND THE LINE OF THE MA'AM. THANK YOU POLITY FOR THE EARLY CAN. GET THIS IS TO LEVINS WITH THE BIO ENERGY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. HELLO- THE BIOLOGY CITIES REPRESENTS MORE THAN EIGHTY LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES COMPANIES COMMUNITY GROUPS AND OTHERS THAT ARE WORKING TO CONVERT THE STATE'S ORGANIC WASTE TO ENERGY. CALIFORNIA GENERATES MILLIONS OF TONS OF ORGANIC WASTE ANNUALLY INCLUDING FOREST WASTE AND OTHER VEGETATION REMOVED TO REDUCE WILDFIRE RISKS AGRICULTURAL WASTE AND URBAN WOOD WASTE. MOST OF THAT WASTED OPEN BURNED OR PILED AND LEFT TO DECAY OR DISPOSED OF IN A LANDFILL ALL OF WHICH RELEASED THE MOST DAMAGING CLIMATE POLLUTANT. KNOWN AS SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS THE STATE'S SHORT OF CONCLUDING LAW SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE REQUIRES THAT 75% OF ALL. LANDFILL ORGANIC WASTE BE DIVERTED BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND ACCORDING TO LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LAB AND OTHER RESEARCHERS CONVERTING THAT BIOMASS WASTE TO ENERGY CAN PROVIDE MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF ALL THE CARBON NEGATIVE EMISSIONS THAT ARE NEEDED TO MEET THE STATE'S GOAL OF CARBON NEUTRALITY. BY ANOTHER ENERGY IMPORTANT FROM AN ENERGY STANDPOINT. NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT REDUCE WILDFIRES WHICH ARE HUGE COST AND RELIABILITY ISSUE FOR RATE PAYERS. BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT CAN PROVIDE A RENEWABLE FORM OF BASELOAD AND FLEXIBLE GENERATION POWER. THEY'RE AVAILABLE WHEN WIND AND SOLAR ARE NOT. CONVERTING BIOMASS TO RENEWABLE HYDROGEN AND OTHER FORMS OF RENEWABLE GAS. CAN ALSO PROVIDE LONG DURATION ENERGY STORAGE AND CAN REPLACE DIESEL AND BACKUP GENERATORS. AB THREE TWO TWO WILL HELP THE STATE TRANSITION TO THE CLEANEST. MOST BENEFICIAL TECHNOLOGIES TO CONVERT WOODY BIOMASS WASTE TO ENERGY. WHICH WILL HELP TO INCREASE ENERGY RELIABILITY AND PROTECT THE ERIN CONDREN. ALL THESE REASONS WE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO PASS. AB THREE TWO TWO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WE NOW HAVE ONE PRIMARY WITNESS IN OPPOSITION TESTIFYING BY PHONE PHONE MODERATOR IF YOU COULD FULLER DANIEL BORROWED WITH THE SIERRA CLUB THAT HE IS UP. YOUR LINE IS OPEN FOR. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS DANIEL BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF THEIR CLUB CALIFORNIA. JB THREE TWENTY TWO IS CURRENTLY RIGHT AND AT THAT WOULD COVER ABOUT 20% OF ETHNIC FUNDS FOR BIOENERGY PROJECT.

THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS THIS IS GLORIOUS HE MANAGED CALLING ON BEHALF OF SO CAL GAS PLEASE TO COMPORT AB THREE TWENTY TWO AND REQUEST YOUR ABOUT THANK YOU. AND AT THIS TIME IF THE CHAIR WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN Q. THANK YOU PHONE MODERATOR SO WE WILL CONCLUDE THE PUBLIC COMMENT PORTION WILL BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS. DR WORK- THANK YOU CHAIR SO A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST SPOKE ABOUT A BILL THAT NO LONGER EXISTS. WE'RE JUST BASICALLY GOING TO POLITELY ASK WHICH I'M SURE WILL NOT NEED A WHOLE LOT. MY CONCERN RIGHT NOW IS THAT THE COST OF GETTING RID OF THE FOREST BIOMASS. IS MUCH HIGHER IF YOU'RE JUST USING IT TO GENERATE ELECTRICITY IS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS AS OPPOSED TO FIFTY DOLLARS FOR SOLAR. SO IT'S FOUR TIMES AS EXPENSIVE. IF WE DON'T DO RESEARCH I MEAN WE ALREADY SAW THE PREVIOUS BELL ARE FROM- IDEA CURRY. THAT BASICALLY NOBODY'S USED NOBODY'S TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THESE FUNDS. BECAUSE IT'S SO WHAT THE PRICE IS SO HIGH OUR TO GENERATE ELECTRICITY FROM BIOMASS. THE PROBLEM I SEE IS THAT IT'S NOT JUST A MATTER OF GENERATING ELECTRICITY. THE PROBLEM HERE IS WHAT YOU DO WITH THE BIO MASS AND WHAT THE ALTERNATIVES ARE IF YOU DON'T DO THIS IT BECOMES EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE. TO SAY TAKE IT AND- COME POSTED SOMEWHERE IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. ARM OR YOU BURN IT IN THE FEELS I REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE WHEN THEY USED TO BURN BIOMASS IN THE FIELDS FROM THE FARMS-WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO AS WE MANAGE OUR FORESTS WITH ALL THAT WASTE. THAT'S WHY WE NEEDED THIS RESEARCH MONEY. AND TO CHANGE TO A SIMPLE REQUEST. WHICH WILL BE IGNORED IN MY OPINION. IS NOT A GOOD IDEA OF COURSE ALL VOTE FOR THE BILL WILL AT LEAST GET ON RECORD THAT WE REQUESTED A SPOT. ARMED WE NEED TO DO MORE THAN THIS WE NEED A- COMPLETE. STRATEGY ON HOW WE TREAT THE JYJ AMOUNTS OF BIOMASS THAT ARE GENERATED IN FARMING AND WILL BE GENERATED BY OUR FORESTS MAYBE THIS WASN'T THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT I KNOW THE COMMUNITY DOES NOT LIE. POLITICIANS CHOOSING TECHNOLOGIES I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING AND I'LL BE WORKING WITH MISTER SALAS AND OTHERS. IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO RUN INTO MAJOR CONCERNS THIS IS NOT JUST AN ENERGY ISSUE THIS IS A MUCH WIDER. ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE THANK YOU. THIS THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I'M I'D LIKE TO SO SEAT MY COMMENTS WITH THE MEMBER- WHO JUST RAISED- THE LOOK MOST OF YOU KNOW OPERATE HAWK. AND I'VE BEEN ONE SINCE- BEING VICE CHAIR HERE BUT I THINK- MY COLLEAGUE MEMBER RAISES A VERY IMPORTANT POINT. THAT THERE IS MORE TO COST AND THEN- MERELY THE CREATION OF THE ELECTRICITY- I WILL VOTE FOR THE BILL BUT SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED THAT IT IS AS WEAKENED AS IT IS. BUT MY HOPE IS THAT IT WILL BEGIN A CONVERSATION. AND I HOPE THAT- THE REGULATORY AGENCIES IS GOING TO MAKE THIS DECISION. WILL TAKE THE COMMENTS SERIOUSLY OF MEMBERS HERE- AND ALSO HAS THE REAL TOUGH QUESTION ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IF WE DON'T. THANK. STRICKER SAID TAGS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COLLEAGUES I'M A MTIVATED TO SPEAK ON THE BILL GIVEN THAT- RIVER COLLEAGUES FOR THE EAST BAY AREA PENSION- HE RECALLS WHEN. FIELD BURNING WILL TAKE PLACE WHY I CAN TELL YOU THAT- THIS SUNDAY RIGHT DRIVING THROUGH THE DISTRICT WE COULD SEE. AG BURNING HAPPENING IN OUR DISTRICT AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPLICATIONS THAT THAT HAS ON THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE. EFFORTS BEING MADE- ONE FROM THE CALIFORNIA RESOURCES BOARD THAT HAS. DECIDED TO PUSH A BAN ON AG BURNING IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AREA TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND I KNOW THAT THAT COULD BE A MODEL. THAT WILL BE APPLIED ACROSS OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT STILL UTILIZE OUR PRACTICE- BIO MASS. AT WITH NEW TECHNOLOGIES BEING EXPLORED HAS BEEN ONE OF THOSE AREAS THAT- IS BELIEVED TO HELP ADDRESS THAT ISSUE- IF WE TRULY WANT TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE. WE WILL NO LONGER SEE WHAT IS A- ANTIQUATED PROCESS AN IMPORTANT ONE- FARMERS WOULD SAY. TO THE PROCESS OF- REGENERATE YOU KNOW THE NEXT YEAR'S CROPS BUT NEVER THE LESS. A SIGNIFICANTLY HARMFUL. PRACTICE WHEN IT COMES TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THOSE AREAS I KNOW THAT COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED SB SIX ONE SEVEN COMMUNITIES SPECIFICALLY DOLLS THAT ARE WITHIN THE RURAL FARMING PARTS OF THE STATE HAVE PRIORITIZED THE BANNING OF- BURNING A FIELD AND THAT. BIOMASS NOT EVERYONE BUT SOME COMMUNITIES OF SAID THAT POTENTIALLY BIOMASS COULD BE. ONE OF THOSE SOLUTIONS SO I JUST WANTED TO. SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE BILL FOR THOSE REASONS AND- ASKED TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR TO THE BILL- BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THIS COULD BE ONE PATH WAY TO ADDRESSING THAT ISSUE THAT IS A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE AND OF COURSE THE IDEA OF DIVERSIFYING THE RENEWABLE ENERGY PORTFOLIO IS ALWAYS. A GOOD IDEA AS WELL SO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO MAKE THOSE COMMENTS THANK YOU FOR THIS COMING. SUMMER CITY. THANK YOU I- APPRECIATE THIS- DEBATE- AND- I SHARE THE CONCERNS ABOUT- YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH ALL THE. FORCED MATERIALS THAT THAT- YOU KNOW ARE ARE COMING FROM. YOU KNOW OUR EFFORTS TO MANAGE WILDFIRES- FITTING THE FORESTS AND SO FORTH- BUT I BUT I. YOU KNOW I WANT TO RAISE MY CONCERN AND PERHAPS I JUST NEED TO LEARN MORE ABOUT- WHAT. THE SIERRA CLUB AND THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY IN LEADERSHIP COUNSEL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN THEIR ORIGINAL OPPOSITION LETTER YOU KNOW THEY TALK ABOUT- HOW THE STATE NEEDS TO EXPLORE MORE NON EMITTING ALTERNATIVES SUCH AS SUSTAINABLE WOOD PRODUCTS OR INCENTIVIZING. REINCORPORATION OF WOODY BIOMASS INTO THE SOIL- AND SO YOU KNOW I HEAR IT I AND I ESPECIALLY. RESPECT- COMMENTS LIKE- MR GARCIA'S YOU KNOW WHERE HIS DISTRICT AS SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES OF OPEN BURNING. ARM AND CERTAINLY. YOU KNOW WHY- AND- FAN IN ANY WAY OF OPEN BURNING AND SO. WE'RE TRYING TO FIND- WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO BALANCE THESE CONSIDERATIONS AND FIND ALTERNATIVES- BUT I CONTINUE TO BE CONCERNED THAT. IT APPEARS THAT THE BILL EVEN THOUGH IT STRIKES THE TWENTY PERCENT. ARE MANDATE THAT THE- IT'S STILL. GIVES PREFERENCE. OR I BELIEVE THEY THEY- THEY AMENDMENT LANGUAGE IS TO. WHAT IS IT. DIRECTLY CC IN THE CPUC TO CONSIDER BIOENERGY PROJECTS. OUR WHICH ACCORDING TO THE ORIGINAL A BILL IT LOOKS LESS. SOME CARBON EMITTING ALL SOURCES AS THE AS ALTERNATIVES AND SO. I AM JUST OF A RAISING GUN MY CONCERNS AND- AND FOR THOSE REASONS I WILL BE- NOT BE VOTING FOR THE BILL TODAY. OKAY STE BARK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I'D LIKE TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM HAYWARD AND OTHERS WHO HAVE SPOKEN TO SOME OF THE IMPORTANT WORK THAT MR SALAS IS DOING IN THIS BILL I AM A DIE HARD ENVIRONMENTAL LAST AND HAVE ONE OF THE STRONGEST ENVIRONMENTAL RECORDS IN THE LEGISLATURE AND YET WE HAVE TO BE REAL ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING AND I THINK THAT IS WHAT MR MURATSUCHI JUST TOUCHED ON WHICH IS WE ARE HAVING TO CENTER FOREST BECAUSE AS WE ALL KNOW ONE OF THE LARGEST EMISSIONS SOURCES RIGHT NOW IS OUR WILDFIRES. AND THE TOXIC AIR THAT IS COMING TO ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES WHETHER YOU LIVE IN ONE OF THESE HIGH FIRE GUNS OR NOT IS POISONING OUR CHILDREN AND SO WE'RE DOING THE WORK TO PREVENT THAT AND THAT IS LEADING TO BIOMASS THERE ARE OTHER SOURCES OF BIOMASS THAT ARE OCCURRING IN OUR STATE WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO AND AN ALTERNATIVE SUCH AS THIS WHICH- ALTHOUGH YES CREATING EMISSIONS CONTAINS A LARGE PORTION OF IT ESPECIALLY AS COMPARED TO OPEN BURNING OR THE WILD FIRES IF WE DON'T DO ANYTHING. SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY POSITIVE ALTERNATIVE AND I THINK THAT'S THE WORK THAT WE NEED TO DO AND I AGREE WITH DR QUIRK THAT WE NEED TO DO THAT WORK AND WE NEED TO BE AGGRESSIVE ABOUT IT AND WE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE FIGHTING CLIMATE CHANGE WITH EVERY SINGLE TOOL IN OUR TOOLBOX AND THAT MEANS LOOKING AT WHAT IS THE ALTERNATIVE IF WE DON'T DO THAT AND THE ALTERNATIVE TO NOT DOING THIS IS WORSE FOR OUR CLIMATE AND SO THAT IS WHAT IS ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW IT'S HARD FOR ME TO STAND UP AND SAY I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT THE POSITION OF THE SIERRA CLUB HERE I THINK THIS IS A BETTER ALTERNATIVE. AND SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL AND I WISH. WE WERE DOING MORE TO MOVE THIS FORWARD THANK YOU. MEMBERS THAT WOULD LIKE TO. COMMENT I THINK THAT FIRST OF ALL IF THE STE THE AUTHOR WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND TO ANY OF THE COMMENTS WILL DIRECT THAT TO YOU IN YOUR CLOTHES IF THAT'S FINE PLEASE- AND CERTAINLY IF YOU NEED TO RELY OR LOOK FOR ANY OF YOUR WITNESSES TO ADD TO. YOUR THOUGHTS BEFORE YOU CONCLUDE WILL WILL LOOK TO THAT OF I THINK WHAT WE'RE ALSO TRUMP RECOGNIZES THIS IS ONE CHALLENGING COMMITTEE TO NAVIGATE THROUGH OF SOME VERY- PROBLEMATIC FIRST OF ALL WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE AND HOW. MUCH TO DO AND HOW. TO MANAGE THOSE EFFORTS AND ALL THE ARRAY OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT WE HAVE AND- RESOURCES THAT ARE BEING. GENERATED FOR US TO. REDUCE OUR CARBON OUTPUT. FIGHT THE WILDFIRES IN ODYSSEY OR- IMPACTING ON OUR STATE AND I THINK WERE YOU SEE IN YOUR BILL. OF MISTER SALAS IS AN EFFORT TO TRY TO BALANCE THE- THE EFFORTS AND I DON'T DISASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH ANY OF THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE OF THE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATION. AS BEST TO TRY TO THREAD A NEEDLE HERE- BUT ALSO TO RECOGNIZE YOUR GREAT EFFORTS AND TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT. THOSE ARE HIGHLIGHTED WERE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH A BILL THAT I THINK WE'LL GET US MOVING AND MAYBE EVEN. CREATING THE KIND OF ONGOING CONVERSATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN TALKED ABOUT- HERE TODAY BY THE MEMBERS SO- WITH THAT IT'S OUR PLEASURE TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD THIS BILL- AS AMENDED AND- IF YOU HAVE ANY CLOSING COMMENTS THAT YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE WILL TURN TO YOU KNOW. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FIRST LET ME THANK EACH OF- MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SPOKEN ON THIS BILL THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT A POLICY DISCUSSION THAT WE NEED TO BE HAVING AND WE CAN'T BE BLIND HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH EFFECTS OF. NOT HAVING THIS ALTERNATIVE RIGHT- MY COLLEAGUES TALKED ABOUT THESE OPEN FIELD BURNING AS I SEE THEM ON THE DAILY THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT AYE THREE CM THROUGHOUT CLIFORNIA. RIGHT WHEN YOU SEE THE KIDS THAT ARE SUFFERING FROM ASTHMA SUFFERING FOR PM TWO POINT FIVE FROM ALL OF THESE OTHER ISSUES BECAUSE THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE IS TO BURN THIS- WASTE WHETHER IT'S IN A PILE OR WHETHER IT'S CALIFORNIA'S WILDFIRES WE NEED TO HAVE THESE ALTERNATIVES TO NOT ONLY CREATE. HEALTHY FOR US WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WILDFIRES THAT'S WHY IT'S PART OF THE WILDFIRE FORCED LITIGATION PLAN THAT'S WHY THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD IS CALLING FOR MORE INVESTMENTS INTO. BIOMASS FACILITIES THAT'S WHY YOU SEE THE WIDE ARRAY OF COALITIONS COMING TOGETHER TO SUPPORT THIS AND- APPRECIATE- MISTER CORK AND OTHERS WHO SAID THAT THE SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM BECAUSE IT'S THE TRUE DISCUSSION. THAT NEEDS TO BE HAPPENING TO PUSH THIS FORWARD I KNOW- WE WERE COMPELLED TO TAKE THE AMENDMENTS TO REMOVE THE OPPOSITION FROM. I BELIEVE AN RTC AT SIERRA CLUB. WHO WHO TESTIFIED EARLIER- BUT IS AN IMPORTANT. I TO SEE YOU SEE PAYING A- TO THE LEGISLATURE AND WHERE WE WANT TO GO WE WANT TO HAVE. PRACTICAL REAL RESULTS- THAT HAVE AN IMPACT ON CALIFORNIA FAMILIES NOW AND THIS IS A GOOD ALTERNATIVE. I DON'T ONLY HELPS US MITIGATE- WILDFIRES IN THE FUTURE BUT ACTUALLY PROTECTS THE PUBLIC HEALTH OF CALIFORNIANS AND I.

TEN EIGHTY SEVEN TO THIS BAR MIDDLE JUSTICE COMMUNITY RESILIENCE HUBS PROGRAM. SURGERY ON THE FLOOR. GIVE US A FAIR LET ME FIRST START BY THANKING YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF WORKING WITH ME AND OUR COALITION ON SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL- I ACTUALLY WANT TO STATE ON ACCEPTING ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE REPORT. WHICH HOPEFULLY WILL GO A LONG WAY TO ADDRESSING CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION TO SUMMARIZE SOME OF THE KEY AMENDMENTS I'LL BE ACCEPTING REDUCING OUR REGIONAL PROPOSED ALLOCATION OF THE CLIMATE CREDIT. FROM 85% APPLY TO RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES WHICH CREATED CONCERNS FOR HOUSING ORGANIZATIONS WE'RE GONNA BE TAKING AMENDMENTS TO COMPLETELY REMOVE PROVISIONS RELATED TO RESIDENTIAL HOUSING UPGRADES AND ONLY HAVE A BILL FOCUSED ON CRITICAL COMMUNITY INSTITUTIONS. OTHER MOMENTS DIRECT THE CQC TO DEFINE KILLED ABILITY REQUIREMENTS AND ESTABLISH THAT THE PROGRAM WILL SUNSET IN TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN. I ALSO WANNA MENTION THAT I'VE AGREED TO MAKE AN ADDITIONAL MINUTE NOT REFLECTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS TO LIMIT THE BILL'S FUNDING SOURCE TO TEST THE RESIDENTIAL CLIMATE CREDIT. TO AVOID ANY IMPACTS TO THE INDUSTRIAL ASSISTANCE CREDIT AND THE SMALL BUSINESS CREDIT. I BELIEVE THESE MOMENTS ADDRESS MOST OF THE CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED I KNOW THE OPPOSITION STILL REVIEWING AMENDED LANGUAGE. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE DISCUSSION. AB TWENTY SEVEN A CUTE NEEDED AT THIS MOMENT TO ADDRESS THE MULTIPLE CRISES THAT OUR COMMUNITY FACES. THIS IS A COMMITTEE THAT KNOWS FULL WELL. THAT THE CLIMATE CRISIS- IS ESTABLISHING AN INCREDIBLE THREATS FROM CLIMATE DISASTERS. FROM WILDFIRE SMOKE POWER SHUT OFFS AND HEAT WAVES. WE DON'T KNOW DURING CLIMATE CRISIS COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY CHALLENGED. WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE SAFE SPACES AND BUILDINGS. ARE VULNERABLE RESIDENTS TO BE PROTECTED FROM EXTREME CONDITIONS. RESILIENCE CLUBS AREN'T INNOVATIVE COMMUNITY BASED SOLUTION TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES. THIS BILL WOULD BOLSTER COMMUNITY INSTITUTIONS THAT ALREADY EXIST. PUBLIC BUILDINGS LIKE SCHOOLS LIBRARIES AND HOSPITALS. COMMUNITY BUILDINGS LIKE HEALTH CLINICS COMMUNITY CENTERS HOMELESS SHELTERS SENIOR U. CENTERS FOOD BANKS PLACES OF WORK. THROUGH HOLISTICALLY ENERGY AND PUBLIC HEALTH OPERATES IT OFFER COMMUNITY SAFE SPACES TO GATHER TO ALLOW RESIDENTS TO HAVE ACCESS TO SERVICES LIKE CLEAN BACKUP POWER. REFRIGERATION FOR MEDICINE AND FOOD AND CLEAN AIR AND OTHERWISE BE PROTECTED FROM CLIMATE CRISIS. THE CURRENT PATCHWORK PROGRAM'S RESPONSES AVAILABLE HAS NOT BEEN SUFFICIENT FOR COMMUNITIES WHILE THERE ARE SOME INDEPENDENT PROGRAMS FOR. SOME ITEMS COMMUNITIES CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE MAJOR OBSTACLES IN ACCESSING THE COMPREHENSIVE SUITE OF POSSIBILITIES THAT ARE POSSIBLE THROUGH THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE LAID OUT IN THIS BILL. BY REDIRECTING A SMALL PORTION OF THE CLAIM OF CREDIT THIS BILL MAKES POSSIBLE THE POTENTIAL OF COMMUNITIES GOT BENEFITS ACROSS OUR STATE. IT POOLS THE FEW DOLLARS FROM ALL OTHER VALUE CUSTOMERS BESIDE LOW OUR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS TO MAKE DIRECT REINVESTMENTS IN COMMUNITIES THE WEATHER WAS WOULD NOT HAVE THE CAPITAL TO ACCESS COMMUNITY SCALE PROJECTS. WITH ME TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF BILL ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS ARE FROM THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ALLIANCE CLINIC CHIANG. AND FROM EIGHT TEN ON THE REBEL AND WITH THAT I WILL TURN IT OVER TO OUR MAIN WITNESSES.

THE DOT STRIKE. BELIEVES REASONS I WOULD ASK YOUR- THING YOU. THANK YOU. WELL NOW MY TO A PRIMARY WITNESS WHICH WE HAVE ONE AND OPPOSITION AND WILL BE TESTIFYING BY PHONE BY MODERATOR IS THERE ISRAEL SALAS SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC. IS AVAILABLE FOR WERE AVAILABLE TO HEAR HIS TESTIMONY. STE. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON- MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ISRAEL SALAS AND I AM WITH SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC WE HAVE AN OPPOSE POSITION TO THE BILL AND CRANK AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ARE INTENDED TO REDUCE THE- IMPACT. BUT WE HAVE TO NOTE THAT THE BILL STILL TAKES AWAY A FORMER BILL RELIEF AT A TIME WHEN. WE ARE ALL LOOKING FOR WAYS TO PROVIDE THE RELIEF TO MANY CUSTOMERS THAT CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE. IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THE CLIMATE CREDIT IT'S AN AFFORDABILITY TOOL FOR RATE PAYERS. AND RECOGNIZE THAT THE TRANSITION TO A LOW CARBON ECONOMY OUR CUSTOMERS HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE TO MAKE THROUGH A MYRIAD OF CLEAN ENERGY INVESTMENTS AND PROGRAMS. ADDITIONALLY FOR SDG AND E. CUSTOMERS- THE SEVENTY DOLLAR CLIMATE CREDIT CAN BE THE EQUIVALENT OF A MONTH'S ELECTRIC BILL AND IF YOU ARE AWARE OF THAT BEACHING YOU RATES YOU KNOW THAT THING SOMETHING. THAT WAS NOTED EARLIER THAT LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS ARE EXEMPT BUT JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THOSE CUSTOMERS THAT WOULD LOSE A PORTION OF THE CREDIT. THINK OF A FAMILY OF FOUR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS OVER THE FIFTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. THE ONLY A FOR CARE INCOME LIMIT THEY WOULD LOSE A PORTION OF THE CREDIT. WE KNOW AFFORDABILITY IS TOP OF MIND FOR REGULATORS AND LAWMAKERS AND BELIEVE THIS BILL WILL ADD TO THE ALREADY CHALLENGING LANDSCAPE FOR RAPE. A WHITE PAPER DEVELOPED BY THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IN ADVANCE OF AN ALL DAY REYES WORKSHOP IN FEBRUARY. FORECASTED THAT ELECTRIC RATES COULD GO UP AS MUCH AS FORTY SEVEN PERCENT. OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS SB JENNY BUNDLED CUSTOMERS- WE THINK THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THE COMMITTEE SHOULD CONSIDER AS WE EVALUATE DIFFERENT PROPOSALS BACK. IN ISOLATION MAY NOT CONCERNING BUT CUMULATIVELY ADD TO RATE PRESSURES ILLUSTRATE ROUGHLY THE RESULT OF. MANDATE THAT WE IMPLEMENT- IF WE THINK ABOUT THE UTILITY SECTOR C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;G&lt;/c&gt;</u> PRECIPITATING AND LEADING ON THE KLAMATH FALLS AFFORDABLE ELECTRIC RATE. WILL BECOME INCREASINGLY CRUCIAL GOING FORWARD AND THEN LASTLY I WANT TO APOLOGIZE FOR NOT DOING THIS IN OUR LETTER BUT IF THE BILL DOES CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD. WE WANT TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR TO GIVE US THE ABILITY TO OPT OUT OF ADMINISTERING ANY OF THESE PROGRAMS. I'M EXTREMELY ATTRACTED THE TPC WOULD DECIDE BETWEEN US.

AS IT RELATES TO THE AMENDMENTS BUT I WAS. SO YOU'RE CONTEMPLATING THOSE AMENDMENTS THAT MIGHT REMOVE YOUR OPPOSITION BUT WITH THE EXPECTATION OF CONTINUING TO WORK. WITH THE AUTHOR. YES WILL HAVE TO CAREFULLY REVIEW- WHAT THIS MEANS IN TERMS OF AN IMPACT THAT THE RATE PERSPECTIVES YOU NEED A FULL DEFINITELY BE IN TOUCH WITH YOU IN THE OFFICE OFFICE. A PERSON THANK YOU.

THANK YOU A PHONE MODERATOR YOU CAN CLOSE THE LINE WE WILL CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT WILL BRING IT BACK. TO THE MEMBERS IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS DR QUIRK. SO I AGREED THAT WE SHOULD BE- PROBABLY BE INSULATING THE BUILDINGS THAT WE HAVE OUR SHELTERS IN IT CETERA. BUT I FIND THIS A VERY. DIFFICULT PROCESS FIRST OF ALL THE POINT OF THIS MONEY THE 15% PLUS 5% YOU'RE TAKING AWAY FROM RATE PAYERS AND I'VE A FEELING THAT THAT'S THE CONCERN OF THE NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED DECISIVE 5% YOU'RE TAKING AWAY FROM RATE PAYERS AND THEREFORE INCREASING THEIR COSTS. I CAN DEAL WITH THAT IF I'M REALLY SURE. THAT THIS MONEY IS BEING SPENT SO WHICH WILL REALLY PROMOTE OUR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND IS BEING USED FOR ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT DON'T. REALLY AREN'T THE BEST WAY AND I KNOW THAT'S A SEPARATE FUND BUT THEY REALLY ARE THE BEST WAY TO REDUCE OUR GREENHOUSE GASES THE TRAIN BEING THE MOST OBVIOUS ONE. THEY. YOU KNOW IF. FIXING A HOMELESS SHELTER IS THE BEST USE OF MONEY TO REALLY YOU KNOW DO ENERGY CONSERVATION SAVE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY USED IN BUILDINGS I'M ALL FOR IT THAT'S THE CRITERIA I WANT WHAT YOU'VE GOT HERE IS. THESE GRANTS YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME SORT OF JYJ COMMUNITY OUTREACH WHICH IS GONNA BE VERY EXPENSIVE. AND CLEARLY IT'S IN IT'S NOT CLEAR WHO WILL EVEN DO IT. I'M PRETTY SURE THE PEOPLE WHO RUN THE HOMELESS SHELTERS IF THEY WANTED TO COULD MAKE IN A COULD MAKE AN APPEAL RIGHT NOW TO THE LOCAL UTILITY THAT THEY WANT TO DO ENERGY CONSERVATION. IF THEY WERE TO DO THAT. LIKE HOMEOWNERS THEY COULD DO IT. NOTHING IS STOPPING THESE INSTITUTION FROM ASKING FOR MONEY NOW WHY DO WE NEED THIS PROCESS. WHY DO WE NEED THIS AT ALL AGAIN. THESE ORGANIZATIONS CAN JUST ASK PG&amp;E SENDS PEOPLE OUT ALL THE TIME TO TALK TO SMALL BUSINESSES TRYING TO GET THEM TO FIX THINGS UP WHY AND I'M SURE YOU HAVE A GOOD REASON BUT I STILL DON'T KNOW THE REASON WHY WE HAVE TO DO IT THIS WAY AND I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE OVERHEAD. THE SECURITY LIKE TO RESPOND ABSOLUTELY AND- AND I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE- THE PERSPECTIVE OF OUR COLLEAGUE LET ME FIRST SAY A FEW THINGS- THIS BILL HAS BEEN AMENDED ORIGINALLY WE HAD PROPOSED TO USE 85% OF THE CLIMATE CREDIT- BUT- AT THE GOOD SUGGESTION OF THE COMMITTEE CHAIR- WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 5% OF CLIMATE CREDIT. JUST TO. TELL EVERYONE WHAT THAT MOUTH TURNS OUT TO BE IT'S ABOUT TWO DOLLARS AND SEVENTY CENTS. FOR EVERY RATE PAYER WHO'S NOT LOW INCOME SO COMES OUT TO ABOUT TWENTY TWO AND A HALF CENTS PER PER MONTH SO I JUST WANT TO. PUT THAT IN IN SCALE- CERTAINLY THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT CREATES- ANY REQUIREMENT- ON THE STATE OR THE COST AROUND COMMUNITY OUTREACH WHAT WE'RE SAYING HERE IS. DURING THIS TIME PERIOD. OF CLIMATE CRISIS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE COMMUNITY CENTERS AND COMMUNITY HOGS. THAT ARE DEFENSIBLE AGAINST CLIMATE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT YOU HAD WILDFIRES AND HAD SMOKING AND HEAT. WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH SPACES PARTICULARLY IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY IN LOW INCOME DIVERSE COMMUNITIES TO PROTECT OUR CONSTITUENTS AND SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS TO USE THAT PART OF MONEY. TO BE ABLE TO FIRST MAKE THOSE BUILDINGS ARE MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT WHICH GETS TO WHAT YOU ALLUDED TO AROUND GREENHOUSE GASES BUT ALSO TO CREATE RESILIENT COMMUNITY HUBS TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITY THAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY. WHAT THIS IS ABOUT BECAUSE THE ALTERNATIVE THAT IS THE STATUS QUO WHICH IS AGAIN SO MANY OR VULNERABLE COMMUNITY MEMBERS. ARE ARE EXPOSED TO THE ELEMENTS NOW- YOU MISTER PARKING ON YOUR TEXT IN A LITTLE BIT BEFORE- AND WE WERE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE LANGUAGE THAT YOU WOULD REFER TO ABOUT THE FACT THAT- WE HAD ENVISIONED. THAT IN THE APPLICATION TO THE SEE PICS OF SO THE PROCESS OF THIS IS THE C. P. C. WOULD PICK UP OUR PARTY MINISTER. WILL STATUS THE GUIDELINES NOW WITH THOSE GUIDELINES COULD ABSOLUTELY REFLECT WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO ABOUT. ADDRESSING GREENHOUSE GASES BUT WE ALSO DO SO IN THE BILL THAT WE WANT. COMMUNITY- SO WORK FOR THESE PROJECTS. WHETHER IT'S PART. SCHOOL THAT. HOW THAT IS THE COMMUNITY HUB AND SAY SANDRA- OR LA. FREMONT WE WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS SOME COMMUNITY INPUT ON THAT BUT THAT'S SIMPLY. WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS AS AS THE APPLICATION PROCESS. THE ADMINISTRATOR WOULD BE ABLE TO ACCEPT INFORMATION. THAT REFLECT COMMUNITY. BY AND THAT THIS PARTICULAR COMMUNITY HUB. IS THE BEST PLACE IN THIS PARTICULAR COMMUNITY TO- TO DEVOTE SOME RESOURCES SO THAT'S- THAT'S WHAT THAT LANGUAGE IS ABOUT. I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU- TO ADDRESS THAT LANGUAGE TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THE ADMINISTRATOR. WILL HAVE OBJECTIVE CRITERIA TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE ADDRESSING THE GREENHOUSE GAS CONCERNS. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BUT ALSO. MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A RESILIENT COMMUNITY HOUSE. THANK YOU. THRIFT. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR. FOR AUTHORING THIS BILL I APPRECIATE HIM DOING THAT I ALSO APPRECIATE HIS COMMITMENT TO ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES NOT BE LEFT BEHIND IN THE GREENREVOLUTION- FOCUSING CLEAN TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS IN POLLUTION BURDEN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES SHOULD ALWAYS BE AT THE FOREFRONT OF OUR CLIMATE. PROGRAM I THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL WITH THE AMENDMENTS I THINK PROVIDES GREAT RESOURCES FOR OUR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MOST IN NEED. I'M GLAD ALSO HE IS WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION TO TAKE CARE OF THE TO JUST THEIR CONCERNS AND I APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE. THAT WERE- PUT IN THROUGH THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU SO MUCH. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. SUMMATION. JUST WANTED TO SPEAK UP- BRIEFLY SET AS MANY OF YOU KNOW- I STILL HAVE- SCARS IF NOT OPEN WOUNDS ALL OVER THE WORK THAT WE DID IN REGARDS TO CAP AND TRADE JUST A FEW A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS REPUBLICAN LEADER- ONE OF THEM THE MOST THE SALIENT POINTS THAT WE MADE UP OF OUR ON OUR PRINCIPLES WAS TO TRY TO GET ALL OF THE DOLLARS BACK TO RATE PAYERS WITHIN THE FORM OF SOME SORT OF A- A CREDIT THAT WAS. EIGHT ONE OF OUR ONE OF OUR OUR TEN PRINCIPLES. IT HASN'T BEEN TEN YEARS HASN'T BEEN FIFTEEN YEARS. I HASN'T BEEN. FIVE YEARS IT'S BEEN LESS THAN FIVE YEARS WERE ALREADY CHANGING THE PROGRAM IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT- AS A MEMBER OF THIS LEGISLATURE TO SAY HEY CUT A DEAL MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT AND THEY WERE JUST GONNA CHANGE CHANGE THE RULES TO VIEW A FEW YEARS LATER I REALIZE OF THE AUTHOR HAS GONE FROM 85% 25% APPRECIATE THAT. BUT IT'S ALSO VERY DIFFICULT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE G. G. R. F. DOLLARS. WE'RE SPENDING THAT ON ALL SORTS OF THINGS. NOT REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IF YOU BELIEVE LIKE I DO. YOU LIVE LIKE I DO. BUT CLIMATE CHANGE IS A VERY REAL. EXISTENTIAL THREAT. THAT OUR GOAL SHOULD BE TAKING THOSE DOLLARS AND DOING WHATEVER WE CAN TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND BEING THE MOST EFFICIENT IN REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IT SHOULDN'T BE A REVENUE STREAM FOR OTHER PROJECTS ALBEIT NOT SUPPORTING IT TODAY JUST OUT OF PRINCIPLE. THANK YOU. BEIJING I'M NOT SURE WHAT I CAN- BUT ANYWAY WE DO APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR- LONGSTANDING COMMITMENT AND THE LEADERSHIP THAT YOU SHOWED AND A VERY IMPORTANT TIME AND I THINK CLEARLY THIS COMMITTEE RECOGNIZES THAT THE- SOME OF THE ELEMENTS OF OUTSIDE OF THIS COMMITTEE GIGI ARE A FUNDING IS HANDLED IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS BUT AS WE ARE LOOKING AT AND EVALUATING THESE TYPES OF BILLS AND SEE THE EFFORT AND THE ENERGY FOCUSING ON- AND ADMITTEDLY IT'S AN AMBITIOUS- PLAN- BUT I THINK IT'S VERY LAUDABLE THAT WERE LOOKING TO TRY TO IDENTIFY. RESILIENT C. N. COMMUNITIES- FOR ALL THE STATED REASONS THAT THE AUTHORS IDENTIFIED WITH THE INCREASE OF WILDFIRES AND CERTAINLY THE IMPACT ON OUR COMMUNITIES OUR FOOTHILL COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF- THAT ARE USUALLY OVERLOOKED- SO I DO SUPPORT THE BILL- BUT I DO WANT TO MISTER TEEN WHO HAD. A QUESTION OR COMMENT- TO BE ABLE TO WEIGH IN ON IT DID JUST A QUICK POINT OF A CLARIFICATION I KNOW MY OFFICE HAD REACHED OUT TO- ABOUT MY ARE COLLEAGUE'S OFFICE REGARDING THE- DEFINITION I KNOW THAT THERE'S A DEFINITION AROUND DISADVANTAGED COMMUITIES AND USUALLY WE'VE ASKED THE PAST TO HAVE- THE DEFINITION AROUND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AS PART OF THE- I KNOW THAT YOUR OFFICE HAD MENTIONED THAT YOU WERE USING THE DEFINITION OF VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. WITH THE IDEA THAT THEY WERE GOING TO BE- REGIONAL DISTRIBUTION BECAUSE I THINK THE CONCERN IN THE PAST WAS THAT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WOULD WOULD LEAVE OUT THE YOU KNOW THE POOR COMMUNITIES THAT OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN BERNARD DINO HAS TALKED ABOUT IN THE BAY AREA SO I JUST WANTED TO JUST ASK A POINT OF CLARIFICATION AND SEE IF THAT IN FACT WAS WAS CORRECT IN YOUR. YOUR SORT OF UNDERSTANDING THAT IT WAS MORE. BASED ON THAT BOTTOM COMMUNITIES- DEFINITION IT WAS MORE OF A REACH. YOU KNOW READ POWER OF AROUND STATE SERVICE AREA APPS. THE AT THE AT TEN OF THIS BILL. IS A KNOW ARE COMMUNITIES THE STATE I JUST HAVEN'T GOT THE RESOURCES- AND I THINK ARE CALLING FROM SAN BERNADINO KNOWS THIS VERY WELL PARTICULARLY. COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN HARDEST HIT BY CLIMATE CRISIS SO WE DO- BASED ON ALL PR'S CURRENT DEFINITION OF VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. THOSE COMMUNITIES EXPERIENCING A HEIGHTENED RISK INCREASE SENSITIVITY TO CLIMATE CHANGE THAT HAVE LESS TO PASS A FEW RESOURCES TO COPE WITH. THE DEATH TO RECOVER FROM CLIMATE IMPACTS THERE IS ALSO ANOTHER ELEMENT TO THE BILL IT REFERS TO THE IMPORTANCE OF GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF THIS FUNDS SO IT DOESN'T ALL GO. TO CERTAIN PARTS OF THE STATE SO WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO SPREAD OUT- THE FUNDING THAT WE HAVE- TO ADDRESS. THOSE NEEDS GREAT THANK YOU. YOU KNOW. ALL RIGHT SO- ISSUE WE REALLY DO APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR- YOUR EFFORTS IN THIS BILL- APPRECIATE YOU WORKING WITH THE STAFF AND- THE COMMITTEE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AS YOU GO FORWARD- WE THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT STEP THAT YOU'RE TAKING A MORE HAPPY TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY IS THERE A MOTION THAT WE CAN ENTERTAIN IT'S BEEN MOVED IS OUR SECOND.
