OF HOMEOWNERSHIP BUT- IT SAID I

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.467

THE COUNTRY AT THIS POINT I

00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:18.636

00:32:20.805 --> 00:32:21.539
CHALLENGING FOR COMMUNITIES OF

COLOR. AND IN AMERICA THIS IS

00:32:24.609 --> 00:32:25.310
HOW WE BUILD WEALTH IT'S HOW WE

00:32:34.819 --> 00:32:36.154
REAL EQUITY ISSUES HERE THAT WE

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:37.188

PRESENT ON THE DISPARITIES IN

00:33:27.205 --> 00:33:29.107
RACIAL HOMEOWNERSHIP RATES AND

00:33:29.173 --> 00:33:31.309
THEN. OUTLINED SOME POLICIES

00:33:31.376 --> 00:33:33.611
THAT ARE CAPABLE. OF PRODUCING

00:33:33.678 --> 00:33:35.012
THOSE DISPARITIES SOME TO DO

00:33:35.079 --> 00:33:36.914
THAT AND I I'VE BEEN TOLD I HAVE

00:33:36.981 --> 00:33:37.849
TWELVE MINUTES ON THIS GET.

00:33:37.915 --> 00:33:39.617
STARTED HERE. SO THIS IS A CHART

00:33:39.684 --> 00:33:40.585
THAT WAS CREATED BY THE NATIONAL

00:33:40.651 --> 00:33:42.120
COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT COALITION

00:33:42.186 --> 00:33:43.588
I'M GOING TO BREAK THIS DOWN.

00:33:43.654 --> 00:33:44.589
THAT IS CENTRALLY SHOWS

00:33:44.655 --> 00:33:46.124
DISAGGREGATED LEVELS OF

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:47.625
HOMEOWNERSHIP ACROSS THE UNITED

00:33:47.692 --> 00:33:49.594
STATES BUT REYES. WHAT THE BASIC

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:52.530
PATTERN SHOWS IS THAT AFTER THE

00:33:52.597 --> 00:33:53.531
GREAT DEPRESSION. ERIC CANS BY

00:33:53.598 --> 00:33:55.700
AND LARGE MOST AMERICANS DID NOT

00:33:55.767 --> 00:33:57.735
OWN THEIR OWN HOME AND MANY

00:33:57.802 --> 00:33:59.570
AMERICANS HAVE BEEN DISPOSSESSED

00:33:59.637 --> 00:34:01.439
FROM HOMEOWNERSHIP- AS A RESULT

00:34:01.506 --> 00:34:03.207
OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION AND SO

00:34:03.274 --> 00:34:04.642
YOU CAN SEE THE VERY LOW LEVELS

00:34:04.709 --> 00:34:06.277
OF HOME OWNERSHIP BUT IN THE

00:34:06.344 --> 00:34:07.678
POST WAR PERIOD HOMEOWNERSHIP

00:34:07.745 --> 00:34:10.047
SURGED AND SURGED WITH BOMBS AND

00:34:10.114 --> 00:34:11.649
IT WITH FITS AND STARTS IN THE

00:34:11.716 --> 00:34:12.817
IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AS

00:34:12.884 --> 00:34:14.585
WELL. BUT HERE'S WHAT I WANT TO

00:34:14.652 --> 00:34:17.155
FOCUS IN ON THIS THIS COMES FROM

00:34:17.221 --> 00:34:19.157
THE ST LOUIS FED IT SHOWS THE

00:34:19.223 --> 00:34:21.325
QUEUE FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE

00:34:21.392 --> 00:34:22.794
HOMEOWNERSHIP RATES BY RACE

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:25.296
ACROSS UNITED STATES ABOUT 66%

00:34:25.363 --> 00:34:28.299
ROUNDING UP HERE 266% OF ALL

00:34:28.366 --> 00:34:30.268
AMERICANS OWN THEIR OWN HOME-

00:34:30.334 --> 00:34:31.569
BUT WHEN YOU DISAGGREGATE BY

00:34:31.636 --> 00:34:33.871
RACE YOU SEE HUGE DISPARITIES.

00:34:33.938 --> 00:34:36.808
SO ABOUT 74% OF WHITE AMERICANS

00:34:36.874 --> 00:34:39.143
ON THEIR OWN HOME BUT ONLY 44%

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:41.412
OF BLACK AMERICANS WITH 48% OF

00:34:41.479 --> 00:34:44.615
LATINOS AND 61% OF ASIANS.

00:34:44.682 --> 00:34:45.817
HERE'S THE INTERESTING AND

00:34:45.883 --> 00:34:48.119
DISTURBING FACT. THIS DISPARITY%

00:34:48.186 --> 00:34:50.021
HAS ACTUALLY GOTTEN WORSE OVER

00:34:50.087 --> 00:34:50.788
TIME NOT BETTER. SO IF YOU LOOK

00:34:50.855 --> 00:34:53.591
AT THE RATE OF HOMEOWNERSHIP. IN

00:34:53.658 --> 00:34:54.425
NINETEEN SEVENTY WHICH IS WHEN

00:34:54.492 --> 00:34:55.159
THE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT

00:34:55.226 --> 00:34:57.195
GOES INTO EFFECT. YOU'LL SEE THE

00:34:57.261 --> 00:34:59.030
TOTAL AMOUNT OF HOMEOWNERSHIP IN

00:34:59.096 --> 00:35:02.633
NINETEEN SEVENTY IN THE COUNTRY

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:04.035
. THEN TODAY. WHITE

00:35:04.101 --> 00:35:06.304
HOMEOWNERSHIP THOUGH 66% AND

00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:08.105
BLACK HOMEOWNERSHIP IS FORTY TWO

00:35:08.172 --> 00:35:09.907
PERCENT. IN TWENTY TWENTY. BOB

00:35:09.974 --> 00:35:11.742
HUGHES IN THE QUEUE FOR DATA YOU

00:35:11.809 --> 00:35:13.211
SEE THE BLACK HOME OWNERSHIP HAS

00:35:13.277 --> 00:35:15.379
INCREASED TWO PERCENTAGE POINTS

00:35:15.446 --> 00:35:17.648
ABSOLUTE INCREASE OVER THAT

00:35:17.715 --> 00:35:19.250
FIFTY YEAR PERIOD. BUT HERE'S

00:35:19.317 --> 00:35:20.918
THE PROBLEM THE BLACK WHITE

00:35:20.985 --> 00:35:22.253
DISPARITY HAS ACTUALLY RISEN

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:25.189
FROM 24% TO THIRTY PERCENT. YOU

00:35:25.256 --> 00:35:26.324
KNOW BECAUSE OF THE DESPITE THE

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:27.792
BLACK WHITE DISPARITY. IS THE

00:35:27.859 --> 00:35:30.228
WORST IT HAS EVER BEEN LOOKING

00:35:30.294 --> 00:35:32.630
AT THE TEN YEAR SNAPSHOT SINCE

00:35:32.697 --> 00:35:35.166
NINETEEN FORTY. IT'S 30% IS THE

00:35:35.233 --> 00:35:35.967
LARGEST GAP THE REASON IS

00:35:36.033 --> 00:35:38.002
BECAUSE- BLACK HOME OWNERSHIP

00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:40.605
HAS NOT ONLY. NOT INCREASED VERY

00:35:40.671 --> 00:35:42.240
FAST BUT WHITE HOMEOWNERSHIP HAS

00:35:42.306 --> 00:35:45.209
INCREASED REMARKABLY SINCE THE

00:35:45.276 --> 00:35:46.744
POST WORLD WAR TWO. NOW I HAVE

00:35:46.811 --> 00:35:48.412
THAT I HAVE THE DATA UP FOR

00:35:48.479 --> 00:35:50.348
CALIFORNIA WHICH YOU JUST

00:35:50.414 --> 00:35:51.349
MENTIONED THE CALIFORNIA HAS A

00:35:51.415 --> 00:35:52.917
MUCH LOWER RATE OF HOMEOWNERSHIP

00:35:52.984 --> 00:35:55.119
AND INDEED IT DOES. I IN FACT

00:35:55.186 --> 00:35:56.220
THESE FINDINGS ARE THINK ARE IN

00:35:56.287 --> 00:35:57.922
MANY WAYS EVEN MORE DISTURBING.

00:35:57.989 --> 00:35:59.423
SO WE SAW THAT NATIONALLY BLACK

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:01.626
HOMEOWNERSHIP IS 44% IN

00:36:01.692 --> 00:36:04.262
CALIFORNIA THAT'S 36% THE LATEST

00:36:04.328 --> 00:36:06.130
DATA I COULD GET IS FROM THE ACS

00:36:06.197 --> 00:36:08.299
HERE. THE TWENTY TWENTY-

00:36:08.366 --> 00:36:09.433
FEDERER'S SERVE DATA IS ACTUALLY

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.469
AN ESTIMATE SO. I DIDN'T WANT TO

00:36:11.536 --> 00:36:13.204
SHARE WITH YOU AN ESTIMATE HAS

00:36:13.271 --> 00:36:14.372
TO BE CLEANED UP SO THE TWENTY

00:36:14.438 --> 00:36:16.707
NINETEEN IS THE MOST RECENT DATA

00:36:16.774 --> 00:36:18.576
FOR ITS 36% THE DISPARITY.

00:36:18.643 --> 00:36:19.911
ALMOST AS LARGE AS THE NATIONAL

00:36:19.977 --> 00:36:21.012
DISPARITY THE BLACK WHITE

00:36:21.078 --> 00:36:22.780
DISPARITY TONY SEVEN PERCENT.

00:36:22.847 --> 00:36:25.583
BUT YOU'LL SEE. THAT THE RATE

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:27.184
THE ABSOLUTE RATE IS MUCH LOWER.

00:36:27.251 --> 00:36:29.186
CLOSER TO A THIRD SO THIS IS

00:36:29.253 --> 00:36:31.722
THIS IS QUITE DISTURBING. BOB

00:36:31.789 --> 00:36:33.157
THERE ARE MANY ASPECTS OF

00:36:33.224 --> 00:36:34.625
HOUSING THAT IS RACIALIZED I

00:36:34.692 --> 00:36:35.893
COULD TALK ABOUT DISPARITIES IN

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:36.861
HOME VALUES HOME VALUE

00:36:36.928 --> 00:36:38.663
APPRECIATION HOME EQUITY IN THE

00:36:38.729 --> 00:36:40.364
FOR WEALTH. I COULD HAVE SEVERAL

00:36:40.431 --> 00:36:41.799
SLIDES MY APPENDIX ON THE RACIAL

00:36:41.866 --> 00:36:42.800
WEALTH GAP IF YOU'RE CURIOUS

00:36:42.867 --> 00:36:44.302
ABOUT THAT. I COULD TALK ABOUT

00:36:44.368 --> 00:36:45.469
DISPARITIES IN APPRAISALS

00:36:45.536 --> 00:36:47.104
DISPARITIES IN PROPERTY TAX

00:36:47.171 --> 00:36:48.139
ASSESSMENTS AND DELINQUENCIES

00:36:48.205 --> 00:36:49.707

SEGREGATION DISCRIMINATION AND

00:36:51.008 --> 00:36:53.878
STEERING AND MUCH MORE. BUT I

00:36:53.945 --> 00:36:54.912
WAS ASKED SPECIFICALLY TO TALK

00:36:54.979 --> 00:36:55.580
ABOUT HOMEOWNERSHIP. THERE ARE A

00:36:55.646 --> 00:36:57.081
BROAD RANGE OF ORGANIZATIONS

00:36:57.148 --> 00:36:58.683
THAT HAVE CALLED UPON GOVERNMENT

00:36:58.749 --> 00:37:00.151
BOTH FEDERAL STATE GOVERNMENTS.

00:37:00.217 --> 00:37:01.419
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO SUPPORT

00:37:01.485 --> 00:37:02.687
IN THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY TO

00:37:02.753 --> 00:37:04.322
SUPPORT BLACK HOMEOWNERSHIP. SO

00:37:04.388 --> 00:37:05.856
GIVE YOU A FEW EXAMPLES AND I'LL

00:37:05.923 --> 00:37:07.592
GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLE POLICIES.

00:37:07.658 --> 00:37:08.426
THE URBAN INSTITUTE IN THE

00:37:08.492 --> 00:37:09.794
NATIONAL FAIR HOUSING ALLIANCE

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:11.495
HAVE MADE IT THE CENTERPIECE OF

00:37:11.562 --> 00:37:12.363
THEIR KEYS TO UNLOCK DREAMS

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:15.333
INITIATIVE. THEY PROPOSED- THE

00:37:15.399 --> 00:37:16.467
DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE WITH THE

00:37:16.534 --> 00:37:18.302

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:24.375
EVEN MORE AGGRESSIVE GOAL. OF

00:37:24.442 --> 00:37:25.810
RAISING THAT FORTY FOUR

00:37:25.876 --> 00:37:27.311

TWENTY FORTY. SEVERAL OF

PEOPLE TO CHURCH IN THE DOUGLAS

00:37:35.252 --> 00:37:36.887
PLAN HAVE ARGUED FOR

00:37:36.954 --> 00:37:37.788
HOMEOWNERSHIP FUND THAT WOULD

00:37:37.855 --> 00:37:39.757
TARGET. FAMILIES RESIDING IN

00:37:39.824 --> 00:37:41.359
FORMALLY REDLINED NEIGHBORHOODS

00:37:41.425 --> 00:37:43.094
ELIZABETH WARREN HAD A SIMILAR

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:45.696
INITIATIVE. HOWEVER IF YOU READ

00:37:45.763 --> 00:37:47.565
THE SCHOLARSHIP NOT EVERYONE IS

00:37:47.632 --> 00:37:49.600
ENTIRELY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT

00:37:49.667 --> 00:37:52.069
BLACK HOMEOWNERSHIP OF EMORY

PHENOMENAL BOOK THE WHITENESS OF

00:37:55.706 --> 00:37:57.375
WEALTH. CLICK THAT HOMEOWNERSHIP

00:37:57.441 --> 00:37:59.043
IN AMERICA IS A BAD DEAL FOR

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:00.544
MOST BLACK AMERICANS SHE

00:38:00.611 --> 00:38:03.114
ULTIMATELY CONCLUDES THAT BOB WE

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:03.547
SHOULD PROMOTE BLACK

00:38:03.614 --> 00:38:05.182
HOMEOWNERSHIP BUT SHE SAYS BUT

00:38:05.249 --> 00:38:06.617
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CABBIE

00:38:06.684 --> 00:38:08.185
OUGHT TO THAT SPECIFICALLY AGAIN

00:38:08.252 --> 00:38:09.987
BLACK HOMEOWNERS ENJOY LESS.

00:38:10.054 --> 00:38:11.889
EQUITY APPRECIATION AND I THINK

00:38:11.956 --> 00:38:13.090
OUR BIGGEST CONCERN IS THE TO

00:38:13.157 --> 00:38:14.792
MAXIMIZE EQUITY BLACK HOMEOWNERS

00:38:14.859 --> 00:38:16.227
PROBABLY HAVE TO PURCHASE HOMES

00:38:16.293 --> 00:38:17.828
IN WHITE NEIGHBORHOODS SO.

00:38:17.895 --> 00:38:18.896
THERE'S SOME COMMITTEE TRADE

00:38:18.963 --> 00:38:20.531
OFFS THERE ON SHE HAS A

00:38:20.598 --> 00:38:22.199
PHENOMENAL BOOK ON DISPARITIES

00:38:22.266 --> 00:38:24.468
IN THE TAX CODE BUT LOOK AT-

00:38:24.535 --> 00:38:26.103
SOME OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:27.938
HOMEOWNERSHIP IN THAT REGARD AS

00:38:28.005 --> 00:38:29.774
WELL. BOB CAN ALSO OCCUR IN

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:31.108
OTHER SCHOLARS ECONOMISTS LIKE

00:38:31.175 --> 00:38:33.411
SANDY DIRTY POINT OUT EVEN IF

00:38:33.477 --> 00:38:34.512
DISPARITIES IN HOMEOWNERSHIP

00:38:34.578 --> 00:38:35.713
RATES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:37.848
REDUCED. DISPARITIES IN HOME

00:38:37.915 --> 00:38:40.151
EQUITY MEAN THAT THE RACIAL

00:38:40.217 --> 00:38:42.086
WEALTH GAP WOULD STILL REMAIN

00:38:42.153 --> 00:38:44.655
OUTSTANDINGLY LARGE. OKAY ONE

00:38:44.722 --> 00:38:46.123
MORE COPY UP BEFORE SURE SOME

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:47.958
POLICIES. SPECIFIC POLICIES ONE

00:38:48.025 --> 00:38:49.593
OF THE PROBLEMS IS THAT THERE IS

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:50.461
A BIG DIFFERENCE IN THE

00:38:50.528 --> 00:38:51.896
LITERATURE BETWEEN WHAT YOU

00:38:51.962 --> 00:38:53.698
MIGHT CALL RACE TARGETED

00:38:53.764 --> 00:38:55.132
POLICIES VERSUS THOSE THAT ARE

00:38:55.199 --> 00:38:56.667
RACE CONSCIOUS. TOOK THE MOST

00:38:56.734 --> 00:38:58.402
DIRECT ROUTE TO PROMOTING BLACK

00:38:58.469 --> 00:38:59.670
OR MINORITY HOMEOWNERSHIP WOULD

00:38:59.737 --> 00:39:01.305
BE TARGETED POLICIES TO BLACK

00:39:01.372 --> 00:39:03.841
FAMILIES THESE ARE POLICIES THAT

00:39:03.908 --> 00:39:05.342
ADDRESS STRUCTURAL RACISM BY

00:39:05.409 --> 00:39:07.078
TARGETING PEOPLE ON THE BASIS OF

00:39:07.144 --> 00:39:08.212
THEIR RACE AND PROVIDING

00:39:08.279 --> 00:39:09.914
BENEFITS ARE EXTENDING

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:10.848
PROTECTIONS ON THAT BASIS.

00:39:10.915 --> 00:39:12.817
CONTRACT RACE CONSCIOUS POLICIES

00:39:12.883 --> 00:39:14.752
ARE THOSE THAT ARE DESIGNED FOR

00:39:14.819 --> 00:39:16.754
RACIAL PURPOSE BUT ARE USUALLY

00:39:16.821 --> 00:39:18.622
RACE NEUTRAL EITHER UNIVERSALIST

00:39:18.689 --> 00:39:21.492
TECH OR CLASS BASED IN DESIGNER

00:39:21.559 --> 00:39:23.694
FORM. THE REASON THAT MANY OF

00:39:23.761 --> 00:39:24.729
THESE POLICIES ARE RACE

00:39:24.795 --> 00:39:25.930
CONSCIOUS INSTEAD OF RACE

00:39:25.996 --> 00:39:28.199
TARGETED BECAUSE FEDERAL LAW AND

00:39:28.265 --> 00:39:29.834
SOME PARTS OF STATE LAW MEETIC

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:31.302
MAKE IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO

00:39:31.368 --> 00:39:32.970
ADOPT REYES TARGETED POLICIES AS

00:39:33.037 --> 00:39:35.072
A RESULT UNIVERSALIST POLICIES

00:39:35.139 --> 00:39:36.340
OR PROXIES FOR RACE ARE MORE

00:39:36.407 --> 00:39:38.676
COMMON. PROPOSITION TWO OH TWO

00:39:38.743 --> 00:39:40.111
NINE BY THE WAY DOES NOT

00:39:40.177 --> 00:39:41.879

00:39:52.623 --> 00:39:53.958
POLICIES TO. PROMOTE

00:39:54.024 --> 00:39:54.792

00:40:10.908 --> 00:40:12.676
BEING THAT IF THEY HAVE MORE

THEM TO GO THROUGH FOR SPECIFICS

00:40:17.047 --> 00:40:19.083

TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:34.465
BUT THE ONE THING I WANT TO

00:40:34.532 --> 00:40:35.599
POINT OUT FOR YOU HERE. THEY

00:40:35.666 --> 00:40:37.034
ESTIMATE THAT IT ONE PERCENTAGE

MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND BORROWERS

00:40:46.243 --> 00:40:48.412
POTENTIALLY FIND HOMES. SO WHILE

00:40:48.479 --> 00:40:50.748

WITH THAT INTERPRETATION BUT

00:45:42.873 --> 00:45:44.241
THIS IS THE PREVAILING

00:45:44.308 --> 00:45:44.775
INTERPRETATION THE SUPREME

UNCONSTITUTIONAL UNLESS IT

00:46:09.099 --> 00:46:10.667
SCRUTINY REVIEW MEETING THAT HAS

00:46:10.734 --> 00:46:12.369
TO BE SUPPORTED BY. A COMPELLING

00:46:12.436 --> 00:46:16.273
GOVERNMENT INTEREST. A NARROWLY

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:17.307
TAILORED TO SERVE THAT INTEREST

00:46:17.374 --> 00:46:18.809
. SO HOPEFULLY I ANSWERED THE

00:46:18.876 --> 00:46:19.443
QUESTION ABOUT PROP TWO OH NINE

00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:21.145
IT DOES NOT APPLY TO HOUSING.

00:46:21.211 --> 00:46:22.646
THE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT

00:46:22.713 --> 00:46:24.882
APPRECIATED- APPRECIATE THE

00:46:24.948 --> 00:46:27.384
BACKGROUND HERE- HE TALKED TO A

00:46:27.451 --> 00:46:28.519
NUMBER OF IDEAS OF HOW WE CAN

00:46:28.585 --> 00:46:30.320
SORT OF HELP SOLVE THIS PROBLEM

00:46:30.387 --> 00:46:32.022
IF YOU COULD WAVE A MAGIC WAND

00:46:32.089 --> 00:46:32.689
WHAT YOU THINK IS THE MOST

00:46:32.756 --> 00:46:34.691
IMPORTANT THING WE CAN DO TO

00:46:34.758 --> 00:46:35.592
INCREASE HOMEOWNERSHIP FOR BROWN

00:46:35.659 --> 00:46:38.762
TO BLACK COMMUNITIES. WELL IT'S

00:46:38.829 --> 00:46:40.397
HARD FOR ME TO PICK AND CHOOSE

00:46:40.464 --> 00:46:41.431
BETWEEN THOSE LESS BUT IF THERE

00:46:41.498 --> 00:46:43.500
WAS ONE SILVER BULLET. AND THIS

00:46:43.567 --> 00:46:45.903
IS NOT GOING TO BE- IT'S NOT

00:46:45.969 --> 00:46:46.770
ACTUALLY HOMEOWNERSHIP POLICY

00:46:46.837 --> 00:46:48.005
WOULD ACTUALLY BE A REPARATIONS

00:46:48.071 --> 00:46:49.573
POLICY. AND I DON'T THINK IT'S

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:51.008
SOMETHING THE STATE COULD DO.

00:46:51.074 --> 00:46:51.575
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE TO

00:46:51.642 --> 00:46:53.510
REPARATIONS. BUT THE ONE THING

00:46:53.577 --> 00:46:54.711
THAT CAN MAKE THE BIGGEST

00:46:54.778 --> 00:46:55.712
DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF REDUCING

00:46:55.779 --> 00:46:57.314
THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP. IT WOULD

00:46:57.381 --> 00:46:59.283
BE A FEDERALREPARATIONS POLICY.

00:46:59.349 --> 00:47:00.884
BECAUSE SHE PUTTING SIGNIFICANT

00:47:00.951 --> 00:47:03.320
WEALTH INTO UP. INTO BLACK

00:47:03.387 --> 00:47:04.821
FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE AND

00:47:04.888 --> 00:47:06.857
THEREFORE IT WOULD MAKE IT MUCH

00:47:06.924 --> 00:47:07.658
EASIER FOR THEM TO AFFORD

00:47:07.724 --> 00:47:09.626
HOMEOWNERSHIP. BEYOND FEDERAL

00:47:09.693 --> 00:47:11.428
REPARATIONS POLICY WHICH ISN'T

00:47:11.495 --> 00:47:12.296
SOMETHING I REALIZE YOU HAVE THE

00:47:12.362 --> 00:47:14.031
CAPACITY TO DO. I THINK THESE

00:47:14.097 --> 00:47:15.532
POLICIES THAT I MENTIONED TERMS

00:47:15.599 --> 00:47:16.833
OF INTEREST RATE SUBSIDIES DOWN

00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:18.769
PAYMENT ASSISTANCE. CLOSING COST

00:47:18.835 --> 00:47:19.703
ASSISTANCE THOSE SORTS OF

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:21.038
SUBSIDIES. ACTUALLY HAVE

00:47:21.104 --> 00:47:22.806
SIGNIFICANT PROMISE. THE PROBLEM

00:47:22.873 --> 00:47:24.541
IS YOU CAN'T DO IT IN INDIVIDUAL

00:47:24.608 --> 00:47:26.643
LEVEL. BUT YOU CAN'T DO IT IN

00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:27.778
USING CERTAIN PROXIES LIKE

00:47:27.844 --> 00:47:31.915
INCOME. WEALTH OR UP. THE RACE

00:47:31.982 --> 00:47:32.783
THE RACIAL COMPOSITION OF THE

00:47:32.849 --> 00:47:34.651

CLARK SILVA. THANK YOU GREAT

00:47:47.431 --> 00:47:50.300
INFORMATION. ONE OF THE THINGS

00:47:50.367 --> 00:47:52.769
IS THAT YOU MENTIONED OF COURSE-

00:47:52.836 --> 00:47:54.438
BLACK INDIVIDUALS ARE LAGGING

00:47:54.504 --> 00:47:56.640
BEHIND LATINOS BUT I'M WONDERING

00:47:56.707 --> 00:47:59.309
ABOUT THE DATA. IN CALIFORNIA IN

00:47:59.376 --> 00:48:02.479
THE SENSE THAT- LATINO-

00:48:02.546 --> 00:48:04.815
INDIVIDUALS ARE FAR MORE OF

00:48:04.881 --> 00:48:07.284
THEM- A LARGER POPULATION IN THE

00:48:07.351 --> 00:48:09.186
STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO. WHAT

00:48:09.253 --> 00:48:10.988
THOSE NUMBERS ACTUALLY LOOK

00:48:11.054 --> 00:48:14.124
DIFFERENT WHEN YOU COMPARE- FOR

00:48:14.191 --> 00:48:16.860
THE NUMBER OF POPULATION IN EACH

00:48:16.927 --> 00:48:20.097
OF THOSE SUBGROUPS. MEANING THAT

00:48:20.163 --> 00:48:22.432
IT WILL IT COULD IT LOOKED TO ME

00:48:22.499 --> 00:48:25.869
AS- LATINOS ARE REALLY ACTUALLY

00:48:25.936 --> 00:48:28.805
LAGGING BEHIND- OUR BLACK

00:48:28.872 --> 00:48:32.909
BROTHERS AND SISTERS BECAUSE OF

00:48:32.976 --> 00:48:35.178
. ALMOST TRIPLE THE POPULATION.

00:48:35.245 --> 00:48:37.047
WELL LET ME BE CLEAR IMAGES

00:48:37.114 --> 00:48:39.249
SHOWED THIS SLIDE AGAIN THIS IS

00:48:39.316 --> 00:48:40.150
HOMEOWNERSHIP IN CALIFORNIA BY

00:48:40.217 --> 00:48:43.387
RACE THIS IS- THIS IS THESE ARE

00:48:43.453 --> 00:48:45.756
RATES MEANING THAT THEY ARE

00:48:45.822 --> 00:48:47.391
BASED ON THE PERCENTAGE OF EACH

00:48:47.457 --> 00:48:50.294
RACIAL GROUP ALSO ADAM SO WHAT

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:51.795
IT SHOWS HERE IS THAT IN

00:48:51.862 --> 00:48:53.163
CALIFORNIA I THINK AS MEMBER

00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:55.198
WICKS MENTIONED BEFORE THE TOTAL

00:48:55.265 --> 00:48:56.400

CALIFORNIA'S FIFTY FIVE PERCENT.

00:48:58.602 --> 00:49:01.104
THE WHITE RATE OF HOMEOWNERSHIP

00:49:01.171 --> 00:49:03.807
63% MEANING 63% OF WHITE

00:49:03.874 --> 00:49:05.542
HOUSEHOLDS OWN THEIR OWN HOME IN

00:49:05.609 --> 00:49:07.577
CALIFORNIA AND THAT RATE IS ONLY

00:49:07.644 --> 00:49:09.813
44% FOR LATINOS IN CALIFORNIA

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:12.149
MEANING THAT IT'S A SIGNIFICANT

00:49:12.215 --> 00:49:14.351
DISPARITY RIGHT IT'S ALMOST

00:49:14.418 --> 00:49:16.486
TWENTY POINTS BEHIND WHITE

00:49:16.553 --> 00:49:19.456
HOMEOWNERSHIP. NO I GET THAT

00:49:19.523 --> 00:49:20.924

THEY'RE OVER 50% OF THE

00:49:22.326 --> 00:49:24.561
POPULATION. RIGHT ABSOLUTE

00:49:24.628 --> 00:49:26.096
NUMBERS THIS IS IT THIS MEANS

00:49:26.163 --> 00:49:28.465
THAT IT'S A HUGE PERCENTAGE

00:49:28.532 --> 00:49:30.567
DISPARITY IN ABSOLUTE TERMS IT'S

00:49:30.634 --> 00:49:31.768
YES YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S PROBABLY A

00:49:31.835 --> 00:49:33.937
MUCH LARGER ABSOLUTE DISPARITY

00:49:34.004 --> 00:49:36.139
AND WHY DIDN'T WE HAVE A NUMBER

00:49:36.206 --> 00:49:37.474

DECLINE IN BLACK HOMEOWNERSHIP

01:19:08.043 --> 01:19:09.678

BLOCKS IN THE WAY. THE TAXES

01:20:06.568 --> 01:20:07.969
ALREADY MENTIONED HOMEOWNERSHIP

01:20:08.036 --> 01:20:09.938
REMAINING A PRINCIPLE WAY MOST

01:20:10.005 --> 01:20:10.739
FAMILIES BUILD WEALTH IN THIS

01:20:10.805 --> 01:20:12.908
COUNTRY- THE WIRING TO

01:20:12.974 --> 01:20:14.209
AFFORDABILITY GAP IN CALIFORNIA

01:20:14.276 --> 01:20:15.577
BETWEEN WHITES AND PEOPLE OF

01:20:15.644 --> 01:20:17.646
COLOR COMMANDS BOLD AND SWEEPING

01:20:17.712 --> 01:20:19.080
SYSTEMIC REFORMS THAT REDUCE

01:20:19.147 --> 01:20:21.349
BARRIERS TO OPPORTUNITY WEALTH

01:20:21.416 --> 01:20:23.685
CREATION SO MUCH MORE- AS

01:20:23.752 --> 01:20:24.753
ALREADY MENTIONED ALSO

01:20:24.819 --> 01:20:26.288
CALIFORNIA'S BLACK HOMEOWNERSHIP

01:20:26.354 --> 01:20:27.822
RATE HAS BEEN LOWER THAN IT WAS

01:20:27.889 --> 01:20:29.057
IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES WHEN

01:20:29.124 --> 01:20:31.993
THERE WERE. COMPLETELY WHEN IT

01:20:32.060 --> 01:20:33.628
WAS COMPLETELY LEGAL TO

01:20:33.695 --> 01:20:34.529
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST BLACK HOME

01:20:34.596 --> 01:20:36.698
BUYERS STILL MAJOR BARRIERS THAT

01:20:36.765 --> 01:20:38.233
CONTINUE TO DEPRESS BLACK

01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:39.768
HOMEOWNERSHIP INCLUDE CREDIT

01:20:39.834 --> 01:20:41.102
STUDENT LOAN DEBT LACK OF

01:20:41.169 --> 01:20:42.837
INFORMATION AND RESOURCES FOR

01:20:42.904 --> 01:20:44.839
FIRST TIME ESPECIALLY FIRST

01:20:44.906 --> 01:20:46.875
GENERATION HOME BUYERS IT CAN BE

01:20:46.942 --> 01:20:48.810
EXTREMELY DEFEATING TO BE DENIED

01:20:48.877 --> 01:20:50.378
MORTGAGE APPROVAL THEREFORE IT

01:20:50.445 --> 01:20:54.683
IS CRITICAL TO INFORM THESE

01:20:54.749 --> 01:20:55.283
INDIVIDUALS OF THEIR FINANCIAL

01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:56.484
OCT. IT'S A HELP OR THEM TAX

01:20:56.551 --> 01:20:59.054
RISK. IN AFFORDABLE HOME LENDERS

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:00.989
AND ENTERED THE HOME BUYER

01:21:01.056 --> 01:21:03.325
MARKET POST. A COUNSELING CAN

01:21:03.391 --> 01:21:04.926
ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY MITIGATE

01:21:04.993 --> 01:21:07.062
DELINQUENCY PREVENTIVE PLACEMENT

01:21:07.128 --> 01:21:09.197
AND GENTRIFICATION AND PRESERVE

01:21:09.264 --> 01:21:11.233
WEALTH. THIS IS WHY THE BLC

01:21:11.299 --> 01:21:12.867
FEELS VERY STRONGLY THAT THE

01:21:12.934 --> 01:21:14.035
LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO TAKE

01:21:14.102 --> 01:21:15.737
DELIBERATE ACTION WHICH TARGETS

01:21:15.804 --> 01:21:17.305
THIS GENERATIONAL ISSUE OF BLACK

01:21:17.372 --> 01:21:19.541
PEOPLE BEING LOCKED OUT INTO

01:21:19.608 --> 01:21:19.941
NINE HOMEOWNERSHIP

01:21:20.008 --> 01:21:22.711
OPPORTUNITIES. ULTIMATELY OPTING

01:21:22.777 --> 01:21:26.448
IN ADDRESSING THE HISTORICAL.

01:21:26.514 --> 01:21:27.882
LEGACY OF SYSTEMIC RACISM.

01:21:27.949 --> 01:21:29.618
EXCELLENT RESEARCH BY MY STANLEY

01:21:29.684 --> 01:21:31.219
EQUALIZING BLACK WHITE

01:21:31.286 --> 01:21:32.654
HOMEOWNERSHIP RATES OVER THE

01:21:32.721 --> 01:21:35.223
NEXT TEN YEARS WOULD CREATE MORE

01:21:35.290 --> 01:21:36.324
THAN FIVE MILLION MORE

01:21:36.391 --> 01:21:38.593
HOMEOWNERS OF COLOR. GENERATE

01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:40.729
NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:21:40.795 --> 01:21:43.832
NEW LONG TERM JOBS AND RAISE UP

01:21:43.898 --> 01:21:44.399
TO FOUR HUNDRED MILLION IN

01:21:44.466 --> 01:21:46.701
ADDITIONAL TAX REVENUES RELATIVE

01:21:46.768 --> 01:21:48.637
TO CURRENT TRENDS. AND WHILE

01:21:48.703 --> 01:21:49.771
SOME POLICY IMPROVEMENTS HAVE

01:21:49.838 --> 01:21:51.840
LED THE WAY TO ADDRESSING MANY

01:21:51.906 --> 01:21:53.241
DISPARITIES THAT BLACK AFRICAN

01:21:53.308 --> 01:21:55.277
AMERICAN INDIVIDUALS FACE WHILE

01:21:55.343 --> 01:21:56.711
EXPLORING ARE ACCESSING

01:21:56.778 --> 01:21:58.346
HOMEOWNERSHIP. THERE'S STILL A

01:21:58.413 --> 01:22:01.116
LONG WAY TO GO AS WE SEEK TO

01:22:01.182 --> 01:22:01.783
APPLY EQUITY AND PARITY ACROSS

01:22:01.850 --> 01:22:05.520
ALL COMMUNITIES- SO- SOME OF OUR

01:22:05.587 --> 01:22:08.456
RECOMMENDATIONS- THE FIRST COME

01:22:08.523 --> 01:22:10.558
FROM A REPORT FROM THE BROOKINGS

01:22:10.625 --> 01:22:12.661
INSTITUTE. SO THAT WOULD BE TO

01:22:12.727 --> 01:22:14.329
INCREASE SUPPORT FOR SMALL

01:22:14.396 --> 01:22:16.231
DOLLAR MORTGAGE LOAN PROGRAMS

01:22:16.298 --> 01:22:17.932
I'M IT IS A PERVASIVE MYTH THAT

01:22:17.999 --> 01:22:19.534
HOME OWNERS OF LOWER VALUE ARE

01:22:19.601 --> 01:22:21.236
RISKIER INVESTMENTS FOR

01:22:21.303 --> 01:22:22.837
MORTGAGES BUT RECENTLY IN

01:22:22.904 --> 01:22:24.339
ALICE'S FROM THE URBAN INSTITUTE

01:22:24.406 --> 01:22:26.441
SHOWS THAT. THESE BUYERS ARE

01:22:26.508 --> 01:22:27.942
COMPATIBLE CREDIT SCORES AND

01:22:28.009 --> 01:22:29.177
THEIR MORTGAGES HAVE SIMILAR

01:22:29.244 --> 01:22:31.146
LOAN TO VALUE RATIOS TO MORE

01:22:31.212 --> 01:22:33.481
VALUABLE PROPERTIES AS HOMES IN

01:22:33.548 --> 01:22:35.050
BLACK NEIGHBORHOODS ARE ALREADY

01:22:35.116 --> 01:22:37.118
DEVALUED THIS BARRIER TO ENTRY

01:22:37.185 --> 01:22:38.053
TO HOMEOWNERSHIP

01:22:38.119 --> 01:22:39.754
DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS BLACK

01:22:39.821 --> 01:22:41.589
BUYERS ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE

01:22:41.656 --> 01:22:44.125
FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS- ANOTHER

01:22:44.192 --> 01:22:45.560
RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE TO

01:22:45.627 --> 01:22:47.395
REDUCE UNEVEN COST OF MORTGAGES

01:22:47.462 --> 01:22:48.797
FOR BLACK HOMEOWNERS I'M

01:22:48.863 --> 01:22:50.598
HOMEOWNERSHIP WHILE BLACK IS

01:22:50.665 --> 01:22:52.801
EXPENSIVE. CREATING A RATE AND

01:22:52.867 --> 01:22:55.837
TERM REFINANCE OPTION WOULD HELP

01:22:55.904 --> 01:22:57.372
MORE HOUSEHOLDS REDUCE MONTHLY

01:22:57.439 --> 01:23:01.810
MORTGAGE COSTS AND LOWER. THE

01:23:01.876 --> 01:23:02.577
BARRIERS TO HOMEOWNERSHIP.

01:23:02.644 --> 01:23:04.446
EXISTE CREDIT AND DOWN IS TO

01:23:04.512 --> 01:23:05.513
BORROWERS IMPACTED Y

01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:07.315
DISCRIMINATORY HOUSING AND

01:23:07.382 --> 01:23:09.684

REDLINING RESTRICTS THE

RESTRICTIVE COVENANT STEERING.

01:23:14.422 --> 01:23:16.091
ANYMORE ARE HAVE EXTRACTED WELL

01:23:16.157 --> 01:23:18.259
FROM BLACKLEY FOR GENERATIONS

01:23:18.326 --> 01:23:20.028
AND WHILE IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO

01:23:20.095 --> 01:23:21.896
SIMPLY EXTEND CREDIT BASED ON

01:23:21.963 --> 01:23:23.798
REDLINING MAPS DRAWN IN THE NEW

01:23:23.865 --> 01:23:26.801
DEAL ERA. PAST INJUSTICES MUST

01:23:26.868 --> 01:23:28.336
BE REDRESSED BY HELPING TO

01:23:28.403 --> 01:23:31.306
DEVELOP AREAS LEFT BEHIND BY

01:23:31.373 --> 01:23:33.041
RACES POLICIES. ADULT CREDIT

01:23:33.108 --> 01:23:34.576
SCORING PRACTICES WITH LESS

01:23:34.642 --> 01:23:36.544
DISCRIMINATORY DISCRIMINATORY

01:23:36.611 --> 01:23:38.279
IMPACTS CURRENT METRICS THE

CREDIT SCORING DO NOT ACCOUNT

01:23:39.881 --> 01:23:41.383
FOR REGULAR PAYMENTS FROM RENT

01:23:41.449 --> 01:23:42.484
AND UTILITIES INSTEAD THEY

01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:44.152
PRIORITIZE LOAN AND CREDIT CARD

01:23:44.219 --> 01:23:46.087
PAYMENTS. EXPANDING THE CHINS OF

01:23:46.154 --> 01:23:47.555
CREDIT BUILDING CAN DISPEL THE

01:23:47.622 --> 01:23:49.157
MYTH THAT BLACK HOMEOWNERS ARE

01:23:49.224 --> 01:23:51.993
RISKY INVESTMENTS. INCREASE

01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:53.027

01:24:20.722 --> 01:24:23.558
MORE RECENTLY- I PERSONALLY MY

01:24:23.625 --> 01:24:25.593
PARTNER WHO'S A BLACK MALE

01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:27.562

CONCERNED ABOUT THE BIAS THAT HE

01:24:42.944 --> 01:24:43.645
WE'VE HEARD THIS FROM MANY

01:24:54.289 --> 01:24:55.356
YOU KNOW IT'S MORE THAN JUST

01:24:55.423 --> 01:24:57.125
REQUIRING A TRAINING WHICH IS A

01:24:57.192 --> 01:24:58.893
GREAT FIRST STEP BUT WE HAVE TO

01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:00.528
CONSIDER MORE ACCOUNTABILITY

01:25:00.595 --> 01:25:02.597

HOUSES FOR OVER FORTY YEARS.

01:27:57.071 --> 01:27:58.373
THERE ARE MANY REASONS FOR THIS

01:27:58.439 --> 01:27:59.907
WHICH EXISTED PRIOR TO COPE

01:27:59.974 --> 01:28:01.309

YOU IS LEGISLATORS DUE TO HELP

01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:28.536
SOLVE THE HOUSING CRISIS. NUMBER

01:28:28.603 --> 01:28:30.905
ONE DO NO HARM IT SHOULD BE

01:28:30.972 --> 01:28:32.607
PARAMOUNT THAT NO NEW

01:28:32.674 --> 01:28:35.510
LEGISLATION IS PASSED THAT MAKES

01:28:35.576 --> 01:28:37.779
IT HARDER TO SUPPLY HOUSING. A

01:28:37.845 --> 01:28:39.480
RECENT ASSEMBLY SEQUEL BILL IS

01:28:39.547 --> 01:28:41.015
AN EXAMPLE OF THAT

01:28:41.082 --> 01:28:42.417
SIMPLIFICATION CAUSES

01:28:42.483 --> 01:28:44.619
UNNECESSARY DELAYS AND ADDS TO

01:28:44.686 --> 01:28:46.921
THE COST OF HOUSING OFTEN FOR NO

01:28:46.988 --> 01:28:49.290
REAL BENEFIT. REGULATIONS

01:28:49.357 --> 01:28:51.392
CONTINUE TO BE PROMULGATED WHICH

01:28:51.459 --> 01:28:53.494
ADD TO THE COST OF HOUSING.

01:28:53.561 --> 01:28:54.696
THOSE REVISIONS TO THE WATER

01:28:54.762 --> 01:28:55.797
BOARD'S CONSTRUCTION GENERAL

01:28:55.863 --> 01:28:57.165
PERMIT INCREASED ENERGY

01:28:57.231 --> 01:28:59.167
EFFICIENCY REQUIREMENTS BY CC

01:28:59.233 --> 01:29:00.935
WILL ADD THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS

01:29:01.002 --> 01:29:03.371
PER UNIT HOUSING COSTS. WITH NO

01:29:03.438 --> 01:29:05.406
SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT. WELL WE

01:29:05.473 --> 01:29:06.441
UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:29:06.507 --> 01:29:07.909
REGULATIONS PERHAPS WE SHOULD

01:29:07.975 --> 01:29:09.343
RECONSIDER THE VALUE OF

01:29:09.410 --> 01:29:11.245
ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS DURING

01:29:11.312 --> 01:29:13.514
THIS HOUSING CRISIS. ONE

01:29:13.581 --> 01:29:15.116
POSSIBLE SOLUTION WOULD BE TO

01:29:15.183 --> 01:29:17.485
ENACT LEGISLATION WHICH DELAYS

01:29:17.552 --> 01:29:21.589
NEW REGULATIONS FOR TEN YEARS.

01:29:21.656 --> 01:29:24.992
NUMBER TWO IT'S ALL ABOUT SUPPLY

01:29:25.059 --> 01:29:26.627
RESTRICTIVE LAND USE POLICIES

01:29:26.694 --> 01:29:28.296
AND A BIAS AGAINST TRADITIONAL

01:29:28.362 --> 01:29:29.597
SUBURBAN HOUSING HAVE DRIVEN

01:29:29.664 --> 01:29:31.299
LANDED HOUSING PRICES THROUGH

01:29:31.365 --> 01:29:33.868
THE ROOF. MANY SUBURBAN

01:29:33.935 --> 01:29:35.470
COMMUNITIES RESIST GRANTING

01:29:35.536 --> 01:29:37.472
ENTITLEMENTS FOR HOUSING TO

01:29:37.538 --> 01:29:38.406
ACCOMMODATE COMPUTERS FROM

01:29:38.473 --> 01:29:39.674
JOBCENTRE COMMUNITIES WHICH ARE

01:29:39.741 --> 01:29:41.576
ALSO UNWILLING TO ALLOW ADEQUATE

01:29:41.642 --> 01:29:44.512
HOUSING. URBAN GROWTH BOUNDARIES

01:29:44.579 --> 01:29:46.247
RESTRICT LAND SUPPLY AND REYES

01:29:46.314 --> 01:29:49.083
LAND PRICES. AS WE PUSH LOCAL

01:29:49.150 --> 01:29:50.284
GOVERNMENTS TO INCLUDE MORE

01:29:50.351 --> 01:29:52.553
HOUSING WITHIN CITY LIMITS LOCAL

01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:54.789
COMMUNITIES REVOLT AND NOW WE

01:29:54.856 --> 01:29:56.224
HAVE PROPOSED BALLOT MEASURES

01:29:56.290 --> 01:29:57.658
THAT COULD ELIMINATE STATE

01:29:57.725 --> 01:30:00.394
HOUSING MANDATES. ONE SOLUTION

01:30:00.461 --> 01:30:01.496
MIGHT BE LEGISLATION THAT

01:30:01.562 --> 01:30:02.530
ELIMINATES URBAN GROWTH

01:30:02.597 --> 01:30:04.599
BOUNDARIES OR REQUIRE THEM TO BE

01:30:04.665 --> 01:30:06.834
ADJUSTED BY ANNUALLY TO MEET

01:30:06.901 --> 01:30:08.836
NEEDED HOUSING PRODUCTION. WE

01:30:08.903 --> 01:30:10.938
ALSO NEED ADULT SUPERVISION OVER

01:30:11.005 --> 01:30:13.608
LOCAL CONTROL. IF WE RELY LOCAL

01:30:13.674 --> 01:30:15.076
CITIES AND COUNTIES TO ALLOCATE

01:30:15.143 --> 01:30:16.944
LAND FOR NEEDED HOUSING THEIR

01:30:17.011 --> 01:30:19.347
SELF INTEREST WILL NEVER DELIVER

01:30:19.413 --> 01:30:20.915
SIGNIFICANT NEW SUPPLY. THERE

01:30:20.982 --> 01:30:22.817
HAS TO BE A STATE REGIONAL

01:30:22.884 --> 01:30:24.652
OVERSIGHT PROCESS WHICH ALLOWS

01:30:24.719 --> 01:30:26.187
BUILDERS AND DEVELOPERS TO

01:30:26.254 --> 01:30:29.157
OVERRIDE LOCAL LEGISLATIVE ACTS

01:30:29.223 --> 01:30:31.359
BUT WE WILL NEVER SOLVE THE

01:30:31.425 --> 01:30:33.094
HOUSING CRISIS. STATE

01:30:33.161 --> 01:30:35.296
LEGISLATION LIKE READ THE RIDEAU

01:30:35.363 --> 01:30:37.498
PROCESS SB NINE SB TEN THE WHAT

01:30:37.565 --> 01:30:39.567
WELL INTENTIONED ARE FORCING

01:30:39.634 --> 01:30:41.536
LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO ACCEPT

01:30:41.602 --> 01:30:43.838
GROWTH ALLOCATIONS. THEY ARE

01:30:43.905 --> 01:30:46.307
RELATIVELY THE MINIMA SOLUTIONS

01:30:46.374 --> 01:30:48.342
AND SUBJECT TO USE. STATE

01:30:48.409 --> 01:30:49.877
POLICIES FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING

01:30:49.944 --> 01:30:51.979
WITHIN THE URBAN FOOTPRINT

01:30:52.046 --> 01:30:54.348
IGNORE MARKET FORCES. FOR THE

01:30:54.415 --> 01:30:56.551
PANDEMIC DEMOGRAPHERS NOTED THE

01:30:56.617 --> 01:30:57.585
TRANSITION FROM URBAN TO

01:30:57.652 --> 01:30:59.053
SUBURBAN AND RURAL DESTINATIONS

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:00.788
AND THE PANDEMIC ACCELERATED

01:31:00.855 --> 01:31:03.891
THIS TREND. ONLY A SMALL PORTION

01:31:03.958 --> 01:31:05.259
OF BUYERS ARE INTERESTED IN HIGH

01:31:05.326 --> 01:31:07.495
DENSITY HOUSING AND THIS IS THE

01:31:07.562 --> 01:31:08.963
MOST EXPENSIVE TYPE OF HOUSING

01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:11.766
WE BUILT. OUR MARKET EXPERIENCE

01:31:11.833 --> 01:31:13.234
IN RESEARCH RESEARCH INDICATES

01:31:13.301 --> 01:31:14.735
THAT FAMILIES WANT SINGLE FAMILY

01:31:14.802 --> 01:31:16.470
HOMES AND THEY'RE DRIVING

01:31:16.537 --> 01:31:18.172
FURTHER TO GET THEM WE'RE

01:31:18.239 --> 01:31:20.208
LEAVING THE STATE ENTIRELY. WE

01:31:20.274 --> 01:31:21.742
CANNOT CONSERVE OUR WAY OUT OF

01:31:21.809 --> 01:31:23.477
THIS PROBLEM WE UNDERSTAND THE

01:31:23.544 --> 01:31:25.279
NEED TO PRESS LOCAL COMMUNITIES

01:31:25.346 --> 01:31:26.180
TO ACCEPT MORE DENSITY AND

01:31:26.247 --> 01:31:28.316
DIVERSITY. BUT REMEMBER WHERE

01:31:28.382 --> 01:31:30.284
EXACTLY WE ARE ASKING EXISTING

01:31:30.351 --> 01:31:32.720
COMMUNITY TO SOLVE THE HOUSING

01:31:32.787 --> 01:31:34.355
CRISIS IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS.

01:31:34.422 --> 01:31:35.823
WHAT WE REALLY NEED IS

01:31:35.890 --> 01:31:37.458
INVESTMENT IN NEW COMMUNITIES

01:31:37.525 --> 01:31:38.793
THAT PEOPLE WANT TO LIVE IN.

01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:41.028
SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES WHERE HOMES

01:31:41.095 --> 01:31:42.797
CAN BE AFFORDABLE BY DESIGN.

01:31:42.864 --> 01:31:44.131
DEVELOPERS CAN BUILD AFFORDABLE

01:31:44.198 --> 01:31:45.433
HOUSING AND LESS DENSE

01:31:45.499 --> 01:31:48.569
CONFIGURATIONS WINDSCALE LOW OUT

01:31:48.636 --> 01:31:50.571
. GIVE ME THE ENTITLEMENTS FOR

01:31:50.638 --> 01:31:51.672
ONE THOUSAND UNITS AND I WILL

01:31:51.739 --> 01:31:53.708
GIVE YOU ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY

01:31:53.774 --> 01:31:55.576
TO TWO HUNDRED AFFORDABLE HOMES

01:31:55.643 --> 01:31:56.577
. THESE NEW DEVELOPMENT

01:31:56.644 --> 01:31:58.079
OPPORTUNITIES DO NOT HAVE TO BE

01:31:58.145 --> 01:31:59.847
FAR FLUNG CONVERSELY THERE ARE

01:31:59.914 --> 01:32:01.549
MANY AREAS WHICH WOULD BE

01:32:01.616 --> 01:32:03.184
CONSIDERED INFILL. FOR

01:32:03.251 --> 01:32:04.919
SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF NEW

AND VETERANS THERE'S AN URGENT

01:33:51.625 --> 01:33:54.061
NEED FOR CALIFORNIA TO INVEST IN

01:33:54.128 --> 01:33:56.330
AFFORDABLE OWNERSHIP PRODUCTION

01:33:56.397 --> 01:33:58.065
TO INCREASE THE SUPPLY

01:33:58.132 --> 01:33:59.467
CALIFORNIA'S BEEN IGNORING THE

01:33:59.533 --> 01:34:01.302
OWNERSHIP MODEL FOR DECADES AND

01:34:01.369 --> 01:34:03.304
NOW THE FUNDING IS ACTUALLY

01:34:03.371 --> 01:34:05.673
THERE BUT THE WILL IS NOT

01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:07.008
INVESTING IN HOMEOWNERSHIP

01:34:07.074 --> 01:34:08.976
PROVIDES A PATHWAY TO STABILITY

01:34:09.043 --> 01:34:12.113
AND EQUITY. AND WE SEE THREE KEY

01:34:12.179 --> 01:34:14.682
LEADERSHIP ACTIONS FIRST TO

01:34:14.749 --> 01:34:16.083
ADDRESS THE LACK OF LEADERSHIP

01:34:16.150 --> 01:34:18.119
WELL AND INVESTED OWNERSHIP

01:34:18.185 --> 01:34:20.488
PROTECTION WE NEED TO STOP THE

01:34:20.554 --> 01:34:22.423
DECADES LONG SHORTAGE OF FUNDING

01:34:22.490 --> 01:34:23.858
THERE'S A FAILURE AND IN SOME

01:34:23.924 --> 01:34:26.093
CASES AN ACTUAL REFUSAL TO

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:27.228
RECOGNIZE THAT AFFORDABLE

01:34:27.294 --> 01:34:29.263
HOMEOWNERSHIP MODEL EFFECTIVELY

01:34:29.330 --> 01:34:30.831
AND PERMANENTLY ADDRESSES OUR

01:34:30.898 --> 01:34:33.167
HOUSING NEEDS CALIFORNIA HAS THE

01:34:33.234 --> 01:34:35.036
MONEY AND WITH THE SURPLUS AND

01:34:35.102 --> 01:34:36.537
BILLIONS OF FEDERAL FUNDS

01:34:36.604 --> 01:34:38.606
INFUSED INTO CALIFORNIA YES

01:34:38.672 --> 01:34:40.374
MEMBERSHIP PRODUCTION WAS

01:34:40.441 --> 01:34:42.143
ENTIRELY LEFT OUT OF THE STATE

01:34:42.209 --> 01:34:44.378
BUDGET AND ENTIRELY LEFT OUT OF

01:34:44.445 --> 01:34:49.183
STATE ALLOCATED ARPA. FUNDS FOR

01:34:49.250 --> 01:34:49.817
PRODUCTION. SECONDLY WE NEED TO

01:34:49.884 --> 01:34:51.485
PROMOTE THE STRONG RETURN ON

01:34:51.552 --> 01:34:52.853
INVESTMENT BENEFITS OF

01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:54.555
CALIFORNIA DOLLARS IN TAXPAYER

01:34:54.622 --> 01:34:55.923
DOLLARS WITH THE AFFORDABLE

01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:58.225
OWNERSHIP MODEL. AND THIRD WE

01:34:58.292 --> 01:35:00.061
NEED TO ENSURE A LONG TERM

01:35:00.127 --> 01:35:01.962
COMPREHENSIVE AND EQUITABLE

01:35:02.029 --> 01:35:03.364
APPROACH TO CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING

01:35:03.431 --> 01:35:04.965
SOLUTIONS WE NEED TO SOLVE FOR

01:35:05.032 --> 01:35:06.400
THE SHORT AND THE LONG TERM

01:35:06.467 --> 01:35:08.302
HOUSING NEEDS WITHIN PRODUCTS

01:35:08.369 --> 01:35:09.870
THAT INCLUDES OF COURSE

01:35:09.937 --> 01:35:11.572
TRANSITIONAL EMERGENCY HOUSING

01:35:11.639 --> 01:35:13.174
FOR THOSE WHO ARE AND HOUSE.

01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:15.910
AFFORDABLE RENTAL AND AFFORDABLE

01:35:15.976 --> 01:35:18.279
OWNERSHIP IT'S A YES AND TO MEET

01:35:18.345 --> 01:35:20.381
ALL OF OUR NEEDS NOT AN EITHER

01:35:20.448 --> 01:35:22.550
OR AND THERE'S A COST TO DOING

01:35:22.616 --> 01:35:23.717
NOTHING THE LACK OF FUNDING

01:35:23.784 --> 01:35:25.753
MEANS OWNERSHIP UNITS DO NOT GET

01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:28.122
BUILT THIS KEEPS OUR SUPPLY LOW.

01:35:28.189 --> 01:35:30.191
IT KEEPS OWNERSHIP RATES DOWN

01:35:30.257 --> 01:35:32.893
AND WE NEED TO STOP PERPETUATED

01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:34.428
THE WEALTH IN EQUITY AND THE

01:35:34.495 --> 01:35:36.297
RACIAL INEQUITY CAUSED BY

01:35:36.363 --> 01:35:37.698
DENYING THAT LOWER INCOME

01:35:37.765 --> 01:35:40.334
HOUSEHOLDS. ACCESS TO OWNERSHIP

01:35:40.401 --> 01:35:42.169
IF YOU'RE LOW INCOME YOU MIGHT

01:35:42.236 --> 01:35:44.238
GET SOME HELP WITH RENTAL BUT WE

01:35:44.305 --> 01:35:46.073
WON'T HELP YOU GET AHEAD. SO

01:35:46.140 --> 01:35:47.908
TOGETHER WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE

01:35:47.975 --> 01:35:49.176
THAT AS WE NEED TO SOLVE THE

01:35:49.243 --> 01:35:51.412
HOUSING SHORTAGE BY INCLUDING.

01:35:51.479 --> 01:35:54.482
AFFORDABLE OWNERSHIP MODELS AND

01:35:54.548 --> 01:35:56.684
I'M GONNA DO A QUICK SHARE ABOUT

01:35:56.750 --> 01:36:00.254
THE CAL HOME PROGRAM THAT WE HAD

01:36:00.321 --> 01:36:02.056
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT EARLIER.

01:36:02.123 --> 01:36:07.495
EUGENE'S. OKAY JUST CONFIRMING

01:36:07.561 --> 01:36:08.896
THAT THEY REALLY CAN SEE THIS

01:36:08.963 --> 01:36:10.898
THOUGH THE CALLUM IS V.

01:36:10.965 --> 01:36:12.399
OWNERSHIP PROGRAM MEANING IT IS

01:36:12.466 --> 01:36:15.002
THE ONLY PROGRAM THAT NONPROFITS

01:36:15.069 --> 01:36:17.471
CAN ACCESS TO GET PRE

01:36:17.538 --> 01:36:19.006
CONSTRUCTION DOLLARS AND

01:36:19.073 --> 01:36:21.275
ACTUALLY INCREASE PRODUCTION AS

01:36:21.342 --> 01:36:23.511
WE HEARD IT'S UNDERFUNDED AND

01:36:23.577 --> 01:36:25.980
OVERSUBSCRIBED AND- GOOD NEWS WE

01:36:26.046 --> 01:36:27.882
HAVE HEARD WE'VE BEEN TOLD THAT

01:36:27.948 --> 01:36:30.084
IT WAS EXPIRING AFTER THIS YEAR

01:36:30.151 --> 01:36:32.019
AND IT SOUNDS LIKE- THERE MIGHT

01:36:32.086 --> 01:36:33.454
BE FUNDING FOR ONE ADDITIONAL

01:36:33.521 --> 01:36:35.322
YEAR BUT EITHER WAY IT IS

01:36:35.389 --> 01:36:38.092
RUNNING OUT. FOR IT THE FIVE

01:36:38.159 --> 01:36:40.561
PREVIOUS YEARS FUNDING AT ALL

01:36:40.628 --> 01:36:43.097
PROP ONE FUNDS WERE DEPLETED AND

01:36:43.164 --> 01:36:44.632
THERE WAS NO OPTION FOR

01:36:44.698 --> 01:36:46.534
OWNERSHIP PRODUCTION WHATSOEVER

01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:48.936
WITH NEW PROP ONE MODEST FUNDING

01:36:49.003 --> 01:36:50.538
WE HAVE HAD SEVERAL YEARS OF

01:36:50.604 --> 01:36:52.473
FUNDING TO THE OFFICE BUT

01:36:52.540 --> 01:36:54.341
THERE'S NO REPLACEMENT FUNDING

01:36:54.408 --> 01:36:56.644
SO WE JUST HAVE A GLANCE- YOU

01:36:56.710 --> 01:36:57.978
CAN SEE THE LAST THREE YEARS OF

01:36:58.045 --> 01:37:00.948
NO FIVE THE AMOUNT THAT WAS MADE

01:37:01.015 --> 01:37:02.616
AVAILABLE SO BETWEEN FIFTY SEVEN

01:37:02.683 --> 01:37:04.485
AND SIXTY ONE MILLION THE AMOUNT

01:37:04.552 --> 01:37:07.721
REQUESTED. OUR OUR EXCEEDS THAT

01:37:07.788 --> 01:37:09.590
AND THEN IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE

01:37:09.657 --> 01:37:11.425
SHORTFALL IS OVERALL AND WE'RE

01:37:11.492 --> 01:37:12.860
LOOKING AT CLOSE TO TWO HUNDRED

01:37:12.927 --> 01:37:14.195
MILLION- AND THEN THE FOLLOWING

01:37:14.261 --> 01:37:15.529
YEAR ALMOST A HUNDRED MILLION

01:37:15.596 --> 01:37:17.231
AND THEN ALMOST SEVENTY MILLION

01:37:17.298 --> 01:37:18.966
SO THOSE ARE UNITS THAT ARE NOT

01:37:19.033 --> 01:37:20.734
BEING BUILT AND JUST SPEAKING

01:37:20.801 --> 01:37:22.636
FOR HABITAT WE HAVE A PIPELINE

01:37:22.703 --> 01:37:25.940
OF SHOVEL READY PROJECTS THAT WE

01:37:26.006 --> 01:37:30.644
WOULD BE ABLE TO DO IF. THERE

01:37:30.711 --> 01:37:41.388
WASN'T AN INVESTMENT. SO ALL AND

01:37:41.455 --> 01:37:42.756
I'LL CONTINUE CARE WITH

01:37:42.823 --> 01:37:44.725
EMPHASIZING THAT THE OWNERSHIP

01:37:44.792 --> 01:37:46.894
INVESTMENT PAYS OFF CALIFORNIA

01:37:46.961 --> 01:37:48.062
JUST JUST YOU KNOW THERE'S LIKE

01:37:48.128 --> 01:37:50.197
A GREY BOX OVER YOUR

01:37:50.264 --> 01:37:52.366
PRESENTATION FOR SOME REASON.

01:37:52.433 --> 01:37:54.902
OKAY LET ME SEE IF I OTHER YOU

01:37:54.969 --> 01:37:57.504
GO- IT IS BACK. IT MIGHT BE ON

01:37:57.571 --> 01:37:59.940
OUR SIDE I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S-

01:38:00.007 --> 01:38:02.710
THE OTHER. YEAH SOME ARE AND

01:38:02.776 --> 01:38:06.680
SOME ARE BOB UNDER OUR IT

ANYBODY IF YOU COULD EVER REALLY

01:38:07.915 --> 01:38:11.719
TALK THROUGH. WHAT YOU HEARD ME

DON'T KNOW. YES WERE WONDER YEAH

01:38:29.203 --> 01:38:31.538
I KNOW THE TEAM HAS A COPY OF IT

01:38:31.605 --> 01:38:32.973
IT MAYBE I CAN GET THE THERE TO

01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:36.977
SHARE WITH OUR- YEAH IF YOU WANT

01:38:37.044 --> 01:38:39.013

US. WE HAVE IT WE HAVE IT I

01:38:41.782 --> 01:38:43.083
APOLOGIZE. YEAH NO THAT'S OKAY

01:38:43.150 --> 01:38:49.690
THAT'S OKAY. OKAY SO DIDN'T

01:38:49.757 --> 01:38:51.759
REALLY WANT TO SHOW THIS TO L.

01:38:51.825 --> 01:38:53.727
HOW OF SUBSCRIBE AND UNDER FUND

01:38:53.794 --> 01:38:55.729
WHICH- THAT THE FEWER UNITS THAT

01:38:55.796 --> 01:39:00.701
WERE ABLE TO PRODUCE. AND THE

01:39:00.768 --> 01:39:03.003
SECOND KEY OPPONENT AT ELEMENT

01:39:03.070 --> 01:39:05.039
OF THE OWNERSHIP MODEL IS THAT

01:39:05.105 --> 01:39:06.106
IT'S A SINGLE ONE TIME

01:39:06.173 --> 01:39:08.075
INVESTMENT BY GOVERNMENT ENTITY

01:39:08.142 --> 01:39:10.778
CHEATS MULTIPLE GOALS SO. IT

01:39:10.844 --> 01:39:12.246
ALLOWS THE ABILITY TO INCREASE

01:39:12.313 --> 01:39:13.180
THE RATE OF OWNERSHIP IN

01:39:13.247 --> 01:39:14.581
CALIFORNIA WHICH WE'RE TRYING TO

01:39:14.648 --> 01:39:16.784
BOOST AND HELPS CLOSE THE RACIAL

01:39:16.850 --> 01:39:18.585
WEALTH AND OWNERSHIP GAP AND

01:39:18.652 --> 01:39:19.887
HELP ADDRESS DISCRIMINATORY

01:39:19.953 --> 01:39:22.189
PRACTICES AND IT ENABLES THE

01:39:22.256 --> 01:39:23.691
FINANCIAL STABILITY FOR

01:39:23.757 --> 01:39:26.560
GENERATIONS TO COME. AND VERY

01:39:26.627 --> 01:39:28.996
QUICKLY AND SURE AS LONG TERM

01:39:29.063 --> 01:39:30.497
PERMANENTLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:39:30.564 --> 01:39:33.000
STOCK BY INCREASING THE SUPPLY

01:39:33.067 --> 01:39:34.835
AND INCREASING HOME PRODUCTION

01:39:34.902 --> 01:39:36.437
WITH HOME CONNECTION BEING THE

01:39:36.503 --> 01:39:39.707
NUMBER ONE WAY TO COMBAT

01:39:39.773 --> 01:39:41.041
INFLATION. SO WHAT I WHAT I

01:39:41.108 --> 01:39:43.243
WANTED TO TOUCH ON IS WHAT THE

01:39:43.310 --> 01:39:44.712
HOMEOWNERSHIP FUNDING STACK WHAT

01:39:44.778 --> 01:39:47.014
THAT MODEL LOOKS LIKE IT SOUNDS

01:39:47.081 --> 01:39:50.351
LIKE YOU HAVE. YOU HAVE A HAND

01:39:50.417 --> 01:39:52.853
OUT SO- I RELUCTANTLY SHARES THE

01:39:52.920 --> 01:40:07.768
BRAIN- I COULD TRY IT. ALL RIGHT

01:40:07.835 --> 01:40:10.037
LET ME KNOW IF THAT WAS FAULTY

01:40:10.104 --> 01:40:12.239
BUT IF WE LOOK HERE THIS IS ON

01:40:12.306 --> 01:40:14.375
THE HABITAT MODEL- AGAIN THIS

01:40:14.441 --> 01:40:15.542
RANGES FOR ACTUAL COST

01:40:15.609 --> 01:40:17.511
THROUGHOUT THE STATE BUT THE

01:40:17.578 --> 01:40:20.347
HOME PRICES FOR SEVENTY FIVE.

01:40:20.414 --> 01:40:21.882
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE FUNDING

01:40:21.949 --> 01:40:23.650
SOURCES THE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT

01:40:23.717 --> 01:40:25.953
IS THE ACTUAL HOMEOWNER LOAN SO

01:40:26.019 --> 01:40:28.455
THIS IS THE LOWER INCOME

01:40:28.522 --> 01:40:30.357
HOUSEHOLDS THAT IS MAKING

01:40:30.424 --> 01:40:33.160
UNAFFORDABLE NO MORE THAN 30% OF

01:40:33.227 --> 01:40:34.895
THEIR INCOME TOWARD. AN

01:40:34.962 --> 01:40:36.897
AFFORDABLE MORTGAGE AND THEN

01:40:36.964 --> 01:40:38.399
WERE ABLE TO LEVERAGE WITH

01:40:38.465 --> 01:40:40.167
PRIVATE FUNDRAISING DOLLARS IN

01:40:40.234 --> 01:40:42.102
SOME CASES WE ARE ABLE TO USE

01:40:42.169 --> 01:40:43.470
DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE DOWN

01:40:43.537 --> 01:40:44.905
PAYMENT ASSISTANCE IS A GREAT

01:40:44.972 --> 01:40:46.407
PROGRAM BUT IT'S WORTHLESS IF WE

01:40:46.473 --> 01:40:47.841
DON'T HAVE THAT SUPPLY WE NEED

01:40:47.908 --> 01:40:49.710
THE HOMES IN CALIFORNIA TO BE

01:40:49.777 --> 01:40:51.044
ABLE TO APPLY IT. AND THEN THE

01:40:51.111 --> 01:40:53.113
GOVERNMENT FUNDING THAT MIGHT BE

01:40:53.180 --> 01:40:54.882
THE CALHOUN PROGRAM BUT AGAIN

01:40:54.948 --> 01:40:56.550
THAT'S A SEGMENT OF THIS THAT IS

01:40:56.617 --> 01:40:59.353
THE ONE TIME INVESTMENT AND THEN

01:40:59.420 --> 01:41:01.155
THE AFFORD BETTER AFFORDABILITY

01:41:01.221 --> 01:41:03.524
RESELL RESTRICTIONS APPLY MAKING

01:41:03.590 --> 01:41:07.261
SURE THAT. THE STAYS WITHIN THE

01:41:07.327 --> 01:41:13.734
AFFORDABLE COOL. FOR I YOU THIS

01:41:13.801 --> 01:41:16.203
IS MEMBER SHARON SO HAVOC ON THE

01:41:16.270 --> 01:41:19.206
THAT THAT RESALE RESTRICTIONS

01:41:19.273 --> 01:41:22.242
WHAT ARE THOSE EXACTLY AND I

01:41:22.309 --> 01:41:23.610
UNDERSTAND KEEPING THIS AND

01:41:23.677 --> 01:41:25.612
AFFORDABLE HOUSING POOL BUT HOW

01:41:25.679 --> 01:41:28.115
DOES THAT THEN WORK AS FAR AS

01:41:28.182 --> 01:41:30.551
WEALTH GENERATION FOR THE

01:41:30.617 --> 01:41:32.786
INDIVIDUAL HABITAT OWNER. YES

01:41:32.853 --> 01:41:34.588
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- SO

01:41:34.655 --> 01:41:35.856
WITH THAT HABITAT SALES

01:41:35.923 --> 01:41:37.257
AGREEMENTS WE HAVE THE FIRST

01:41:37.324 --> 01:41:39.893
RIGHT OF REFUSAL SO TYPICALLY-

01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:41.328
IDEALLY HABITAT WOULD RE

01:41:41.395 --> 01:41:42.596
PURCHASE AND THEN WE WOULD MAKE

01:41:42.663 --> 01:41:43.931
THAT AVAILABLE TO ANOTHER

01:41:43.997 --> 01:41:45.532
QUALIFIED LOWER INCOME.

01:41:45.599 --> 01:41:47.301
HOUSEHOLDS IT HABITAT FOR SOME

01:41:47.367 --> 01:41:48.802
REASON DID NOT REPURCHASE THERE

01:41:48.869 --> 01:41:51.104
STILL AN AFFORDABILITY

01:41:51.171 --> 01:41:52.806
RESTRICTION THAT ALLOWS THE

01:41:52.873 --> 01:41:54.908
ORIGINAL OWNER TO BUILD MODEST

01:41:54.975 --> 01:41:56.443
EQUITY SO THEY ARE EARNING

01:41:56.510 --> 01:41:58.445
EQUITY BUT THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO

01:41:58.512 --> 01:42:01.582
FLIP IT WITH THE EQUITY THAT.

01:42:01.648 --> 01:42:02.983
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET A

01:42:03.050 --> 01:42:05.085
WINDFALL PROFIT SO THERE'S A

01:42:05.152 --> 01:42:07.387
SHARED AGREEMENT THAT IS SPELLED

01:42:07.454 --> 01:42:09.556
OUT AT THE VERY BIG EARLY ON

01:42:09.623 --> 01:42:10.457
DURING THE QUALIFICATION

01:42:10.524 --> 01:42:11.592
THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS AND THE

01:42:11.658 --> 01:42:13.060
INTENTION LIKE I SAID IS TO

01:42:13.126 --> 01:42:14.928
BUILD MODEST EQUITY. A LOT OF

01:42:14.995 --> 01:42:17.097
HOMEOWNERS ARE THEN ABLE TO SAVE

01:42:17.164 --> 01:42:18.565
BECAUSE THEY HAVE THAT LOCKED IN

01:42:18.632 --> 01:42:22.736
MORTGAGE AND ARE ABLE TO MOVE

01:42:22.803 --> 01:42:23.537
INTO MARKET RATE HOUSING. THANK

01:42:23.604 --> 01:42:29.276

UP. OKAY HAPPY TO WRAP UP- JUST

01:42:32.246 --> 01:42:33.413
WANTED TO QUICKLY SAY THAT THE

01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:34.615
AFFORDABLE OWNERSHIP MODEL

01:42:34.681 --> 01:42:36.450
DOESN'T JUST SOUND THAT WE HAVE

01:42:36.517 --> 01:42:38.085
DECADES OF EVIDENCE- ESPECIALLY

01:42:38.151 --> 01:42:39.753
DURING THAT THE PANDEMIC THERE'S

01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:42.723
COMPELLING EVIDENCE THAT ONLY 7%

01:42:42.789 --> 01:42:44.658
OF HABITAT MORTGAGE HOLDERS WERE

01:42:44.725 --> 01:42:47.094
LAID ON THE MORTGAGE AND ZERO

01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:49.863
WERE AT RISK OF FORECLOSURE. SO

01:42:49.930 --> 01:42:51.732
WE REALLY ARE ENCOURAGING YOUR

01:42:51.798 --> 01:42:53.300
SHIP TO INVEST IN AFFORDABLE

01:42:53.367 --> 01:42:54.968
HOMEOWNERSHIP PRODUCTION MAX

01:42:55.035 --> 01:42:56.904
MIGHT STATE HOUSING INVESTMENTS

01:42:56.970 --> 01:42:59.239
AND HABITAT IS HERE AS A PARTNER

01:42:59.306 --> 01:43:00.941
WE WANT TO WORK TOGETHER TO HELP

01:43:01.008 --> 01:43:02.910
SOLVE THIS CRISIS THANK YOU FOR

01:43:02.976 --> 01:43:04.678
YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION. THANK

YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR

01:43:05.512 --> 01:43:07.447
PRESENTATION AND ROLLING WITH

01:43:07.514 --> 01:43:09.716
SOME OF THE TECH CHALLENGES

01:43:09.783 --> 01:43:11.084
THERE- NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM TOM

01:43:11.151 --> 01:43:12.819
MCCALL AND SHOP PRESIDENCY OF

01:43:12.886 --> 01:43:16.690
SELF HELP ENTERPRISES TOM EITHER

01:43:16.757 --> 01:43:18.559
. THANK YOU VERY. ABOUT YOUR

01:43:18.625 --> 01:43:22.195
WEIGHT SIX OH COMMITTEE MEMBERS

01:43:22.262 --> 01:43:23.530
- I REPRESENTED OR- THAT'S-

01:43:23.597 --> 01:43:25.966
WORKING SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY

01:43:26.033 --> 01:43:28.068
FIVE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY.

01:43:28.135 --> 01:43:28.569
TO CREATE HOMEOWNERSHIP

01:43:28.635 --> 01:43:31.905
OPPORTUNITIES- WE DO THAT IN

01:43:31.972 --> 01:43:33.807
THREE DISTINCT STRATEGIES. BOB

01:43:33.874 --> 01:43:35.809
FIRST IS WE HAVE AN ACTIVE

01:43:35.876 --> 01:43:37.511
MUTUAL SELF HELP HOUSING

01:43:37.578 --> 01:43:39.713
PROGRAM- AND THAT'S WHERE

01:43:39.780 --> 01:43:41.381
FAMILIES BUILD THEIR OWN HOMES

01:43:41.448 --> 01:43:43.584
WITH OUR HELP- THEY HELP EACH

01:43:43.650 --> 01:43:45.285
OTHER AS WELL WE BILL TEN HOMES

01:43:45.352 --> 01:43:46.553
AT A TIME AND THE WAY IT WORKS

01:43:46.620 --> 01:43:48.722
IS THAT ALL HOME START. THE SAME

01:43:48.789 --> 01:43:50.791
DAY. BUT NOBODY MOVES UNTIL A

01:43:50.857 --> 01:43:52.759
TENER DONE SO IT'S REALLY THAT

01:43:52.826 --> 01:43:54.628
SHARED LABOR. THAT MAKES THE

01:43:54.695 --> 01:43:56.563
DIFFERENCE. THE SECOND STRATEGY

01:43:56.630 --> 01:43:58.932
IS WE WORK WITH A NUMBER OF US

01:43:58.999 --> 01:43:59.833
CITIES AND COUNTIES IN THE

01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:02.069
VALLEY. TO HELP THEM OPERATE

01:44:02.135 --> 01:44:04.071
HOMEBUYER ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS

01:44:04.137 --> 01:44:06.006
THROUGH A VARIETY OF STATE AND

01:44:06.073 --> 01:44:08.709
FEDERAL- SOURCES. AND THE THIRD

01:44:08.775 --> 01:44:10.177
THING THAT WE DO IS WE PROVIDE

01:44:10.243 --> 01:44:11.845
HOMEBUYER EDUCATION CREDIT

01:44:11.912 --> 01:44:14.548
COUNSELING- AND LINKAGES TO

01:44:14.615 --> 01:44:20.487
OTHER KINDS OF SUBSIDY PROGRAMS. LIKE SOME THAT WERE MENTIONED

01:44:20.554 --> 01:44:22.522
TODAY. BOB ALL TOLD WE'VE- OVER

01:44:22.589 --> 01:44:23.924
TEN. FAMILIES THROUGH THAT-

01:44:23.991 --> 01:44:26.827
THOSE THREE STRATEGIES- ABOUT

01:44:26.893 --> 01:44:28.729
SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED OF THOSE- ART

01:44:28.795 --> 01:44:29.596
THROUGH OUR SELF HELP HOUSING

01:44:29.663 --> 01:44:32.165
PROGRAMS THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN-

01:44:32.232 --> 01:44:34.067
STABLE PERMANENT AFFORDABLE

01:44:34.134 --> 01:44:36.203
HOUSING FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES-

01:44:36.269 --> 01:44:38.338
WITH WEALTH BUILDING OUTCOMES-

01:44:38.405 --> 01:44:41.341
AND- PREDOMINATELY- BY FAR AND

01:44:41.408 --> 01:44:43.443
AWAY. OF PEOPLE OF COLOR WELL

01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:45.779
OVER 80% OF THE FAMILIES WHO

01:44:45.846 --> 01:44:47.514
PARTICIPATED IN OUR PROGRAMS

01:44:47.581 --> 01:44:49.783
HAVE BEEN CUT PEOPLE OF COLOR

01:44:49.850 --> 01:44:51.618
MOST MANY OF WHICH HAVE BEEN

01:44:51.685 --> 01:44:55.222
FARMWORKERS. OF LATINO DESCENT.

01:44:55.288 --> 01:44:57.024
WITH COSTS IN HOME ABOUT VALUES

01:44:57.090 --> 01:45:00.193
AND BY NEARLY 30% IN JUST THE

01:45:00.260 --> 01:45:02.029
PAST YEAR AND SOME OF OUR

01:45:02.095 --> 01:45:04.965
MARKETS. THE GAP. FOR FAMILIES

01:45:05.032 --> 01:45:06.667
TRYING TO ACHIEVE HOMEOWNERSHIP

01:45:06.733 --> 01:45:08.435
LOW INCOME FAMILIES IS

01:45:08.502 --> 01:45:10.904
INCREASING. UP FOR PROJECTS THAT

01:45:10.971 --> 01:45:13.073
WE HAVE THAT ARE IN PROCESS WE

01:45:13.140 --> 01:45:15.342
CAN KEEP PRICES LOWER BECAUSE WE

01:45:15.409 --> 01:45:17.511
DON'T HAVE A PROFIT MOTIVE- IT

01:45:17.577 --> 01:45:19.212
IN THE SELF HELP PROGRAM THE

01:45:19.279 --> 01:45:20.647
BULK OF THE LABOR IS PROVIDED

01:45:20.714 --> 01:45:22.282
THROUGH SWEAT EQUITY SO SOME OF

01:45:22.349 --> 01:45:24.017
THE LABOR INCREASES WE DON'T

01:45:24.084 --> 01:45:26.319
HAVE TO BEAR. UP BUT THERE ARE

01:45:26.386 --> 01:45:29.222
STILL MAJOR GAPS AND SO WITHOUT

01:45:29.289 --> 01:45:31.958
RE. REHASHING SOME OF THE THINGS

01:45:32.025 --> 01:45:34.194
THAT I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH

01:45:34.261 --> 01:45:36.430
FROM- MY HABITAT COUNTERPART I

01:45:36.496 --> 01:45:37.831
WILL MENTION A COUPLE OF A

01:45:37.898 --> 01:45:39.199
PROGRAM IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE

01:45:39.266 --> 01:45:41.301
FAIRLY SPECIFIC IN NATURE THAT

01:45:41.368 --> 01:45:43.403
WOULD REALLY HELP US DELIVER-

01:45:43.470 --> 01:45:47.974
THESE THESE PROGRAMS TO MORE.

01:45:48.041 --> 01:45:49.109
DESERVING HOMEBUYERS. FIRST CAL

01:45:49.176 --> 01:45:50.143
HOME FOR PROGRAM HAS BEEN TO

01:45:50.210 --> 01:45:51.845
ABOUT LOT. BUT IT CERTAINLY IS

01:45:51.912 --> 01:45:53.480
THE BEST TOOL THAT WE'VE EVER

01:45:53.547 --> 01:45:55.082
SEEN DEVISED BY THE STATE TO

01:45:55.148 --> 01:45:57.784
ASSIST LOW INCOME. HOMEBUYERS

01:45:57.851 --> 01:45:59.920
BOB BUT FIRST THE COMPETITION

01:45:59.986 --> 01:46:02.155
FOR FUNDS NEEDS TO USE MORE

01:46:02.222 --> 01:46:05.459
GRANULAR DATA. HAS AS A BASIC

01:46:05.525 --> 01:46:07.928
METRIC AND NOT COUNTY WHAT DATA.

01:46:07.994 --> 01:46:09.663
MAKES DIFFICULT FOR SOME SMALL

01:46:09.730 --> 01:46:13.033
CITIES AND RURAL COMMUNITIES TO

01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:15.235
COMPETE EFFECTIVELY FOR FUNDS.

01:46:15.302 --> 01:46:17.671
SECONDLY WE NEED TO MAKE A

01:46:17.738 --> 01:46:19.573
PROGRAM COMPATIBLE WITH PRIMARY

01:46:19.639 --> 01:46:22.476
MORTGAGE PROGRAMS. SUCH AS THE

01:46:22.542 --> 01:46:25.011
USDA RURAL DEVELOPMENT FIVE A TO

01:46:25.078 --> 01:46:26.813
DIRECT MORTGAGE PROGRAM WHICH WE

01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:28.381
USE EXTENSIVELY HERSELF UP

01:46:28.448 --> 01:46:31.017
HOUSING PROGRAM- THERE ARE SOME

01:46:31.084 --> 01:46:32.719
DIFFERENCES IN THE INCOME

01:46:32.786 --> 01:46:34.855
REQUIREMENTS THAT. FRANKLY THE

01:46:34.921 --> 01:46:37.357
STATE DOES NOT NEED TO APPLY

01:46:37.424 --> 01:46:40.127
THAT COULD ALLOW THE USDA- OF

01:46:40.193 --> 01:46:45.198
METRICS TO GOVERN. OUR THIRD

01:46:45.265 --> 01:46:46.299
CALLUM PRO FUNDING NEEDS TO BE

01:46:46.366 --> 01:46:49.803
MORE FLEXIBLE INCLUDING ALLOWING

01:46:49.870 --> 01:46:52.072
FOR VERTICAL CONSTRUCTION COSTS-

01:46:52.139 --> 01:46:54.441
IN RECENT- NOTICES OF FUNDING

01:46:54.508 --> 01:46:56.076
AVAILABILITY THAT HAS NOT BEEN

01:46:56.143 --> 01:46:58.779
ALLOWED WHAT IT HAS BEEN IN PAST

01:46:58.845 --> 01:47:01.882
CYCLES. AND LASTLY THERE NEEDS

01:47:01.948 --> 01:47:03.817
TO BE ONGOING FLEXIBILITY OF THE

01:47:03.884 --> 01:47:05.418
LOAN AMOUNTS THAT ARE NEEDED

01:47:05.485 --> 01:47:07.721
THAT CAN BE RESPONSIVE TO LOCAL

01:47:07.788 --> 01:47:10.290
MARKET CONDITIONS. A WORD ABOUT

01:47:10.357 --> 01:47:12.526
FEDERAL PROGRAMS THAT- ARE

01:47:12.592 --> 01:47:14.661
PASSED THROUGH THE STATE.

01:47:14.728 --> 01:47:16.363
DEPARTMENT HOUSING AND COMMUNITY

01:47:16.429 --> 01:47:18.598
DEVELOPMENT- BOB AND LOCAL

01:47:18.665 --> 01:47:19.900
GUIDELINES SHOULD SHOULD BE

01:47:19.966 --> 01:47:22.068
FLEXIBLE AS LONG AS THEY CONFORM

01:47:22.135 --> 01:47:24.070
TO THE REGULATIONS AND NOT ONE

01:47:24.137 --> 01:47:26.373
SIZE FITS ALL AND I'M MOSTLY

01:47:26.439 --> 01:47:28.642
REFERRING TO THE HOME AND CDBG

01:47:28.708 --> 01:47:30.477
PROGRAMS WHICH CAN ALSO BE.

01:47:30.544 --> 01:47:32.379
CRITICAL ASSISTANCE FOR FIRST

01:47:32.445 --> 01:47:35.916
TIME HOMEBUYERS. BOB ALSO STATE

01:47:35.982 --> 01:47:38.018
PROGRAMS SHOULD NOT DISCOURAGE

01:47:38.084 --> 01:47:40.120
SINGLE FAMILY HOMEOWNERSHIP.

01:47:40.187 --> 01:47:42.722
SIMPLY BY THE WAY THEY ARE- THEY

01:47:42.789 --> 01:47:44.724
THEY ARE ROLLED OUT. CURRENTLY

01:47:44.791 --> 01:47:46.459
BOTH THE INFILL INFRASTRUCTURE

01:47:46.526 --> 01:47:48.528

01:47:48.595 --> 01:47:50.163
HOUSING AND SUSTAINABLE

01:47:50.230 --> 01:47:51.932
COMMUNITIES PROGRAM ARE

01:47:51.998 --> 01:47:54.067
ESSENTIALLY NOT ACCESSIBLE FOR

01:47:54.134 --> 01:47:55.869
MOST HOMEOWNERSHIP PROGRAMS

01:47:55.936 --> 01:47:57.537
BECAUSE OF MINIMUM DENSITY

01:47:57.604 --> 01:47:59.172
REQUIREMENTS BUT WHILE WE

01:47:59.239 --> 01:48:00.240
UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:48:00.307 --> 01:48:02.843
DENSITY WE OURSELVES HAVE. BEEN

01:48:02.909 --> 01:48:05.912
ACTIVE- PARTICIPANTS IN IN

01:48:05.979 --> 01:48:07.948
UTILIZING DENSITY BONUSES AND

ALL OF OUR SINGLE FAMILY

01:48:08.748 --> 01:48:11.818
SUBDIVISION- IT IT IT SHOULD NOT

01:48:11.885 --> 01:48:14.988
PRECLUDE HOMEOWNERSHIP ARE

01:48:15.055 --> 01:48:17.524
PROJECTS FOR BIG TWENTY. ALSO

01:48:17.591 --> 01:48:19.759
JUST DON'T WORK TELL HFA USED TO

01:48:19.826 --> 01:48:21.194

01:48:21.261 --> 01:48:23.830
FINANCING FOR OUR SELF HELP HOME

01:48:23.897 --> 01:48:25.899
BUILDERS IN AREAS THAT WE'RE

01:48:25.966 --> 01:48:28.902
USDA FUNDING IS NOT AVAILABLE

01:48:28.969 --> 01:48:31.037
BECAUSE OF ELIGIBILITY. IF THEY

01:48:31.104 --> 01:48:33.106
DID THROUGH GREAT FORWARD-

01:48:33.173 --> 01:48:35.275
FORWARD COMMITMENT PROGRAS THAT

01:48:35.342 --> 01:48:36.610
REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF

01:48:36.676 --> 01:48:38.278
VULNERABILITY DURING THE COURSE

01:48:38.345 --> 01:48:39.346
OF CONSTRUCTION FOR HOME

01:48:39.412 --> 01:48:40.881
BUILDERS. THEY NEED TO DO THIS

01:48:40.947 --> 01:48:42.549
PROGRAM AGAIN IT HAS NOT BEEN

01:48:42.616 --> 01:48:45.585

01:48:45.652 --> 01:48:49.489
YEARS. SINCE THE RECESSION.

01:48:49.556 --> 01:48:50.757
TELOGEN PHASE ALSO MANAGED A

01:48:50.824 --> 01:48:52.926
GREAT PROGRAM IT WAS THE SCHOOL

01:48:52.993 --> 01:48:55.395
FEES REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAM- WHEN

01:48:55.462 --> 01:48:56.796
THEY GOT FUNDING THROUGH SOME

01:48:56.863 --> 01:49:00.300
EARLIER BOND ISSUE- ISSUES TO-

01:49:00.367 --> 01:49:02.035
TO OFFSET THE COSTS THAT HELP

01:49:02.102 --> 01:49:03.303
THOUSANDS OF FIRST TIME HOME

01:49:03.370 --> 01:49:05.171
BUYERS. WHICH ALSO NEEDS TO BE

01:49:05.238 --> 01:49:07.540
FUNDED AGAIN THE IRONY IS THAT

01:49:07.607 --> 01:49:09.209
THE POOREST RURAL COMMUNITIES

01:49:09.276 --> 01:49:11.278
ARE OFTEN AREAS WITH THE HIGHEST

01:49:11.344 --> 01:49:13.513
SCHOOL IMPACT FEES. WHICH

01:49:13.580 --> 01:49:15.849
BECOMES A MISMATCH FOR LOCAL

01:49:15.916 --> 01:49:18.351
HOME VALUES. MY ORGANIZATION

01:49:18.418 --> 01:49:19.886
DOES IT SHARE OF RENTAL HOUSING

01:49:19.953 --> 01:49:21.554

INCOME AND ON HOUSE RESIDENTS.

01:49:23.556 --> 01:49:24.524

01:49:24.591 --> 01:49:25.892
THOSE PROGRAMS BUT AFFORDABLE

01:49:25.959 --> 01:49:27.494
HOME OWNERSHIP NEEDS TO BE A

01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:28.361
CRITICAL PART OF OUR HOUSING

01:49:28.428 --> 01:49:30.597

01:49:45.512 --> 01:49:47.580
PERSPECTIVE HOME BUYERS LOSE OUT

TO ALL CASH OFFERS WE SEE IT ALL

01:49:49.983 --> 01:49:53.186
THE TIME- ANDERS WE HAVE FUNDS

01:49:53.253 --> 01:49:55.388

01:49:55.455 --> 01:49:57.557
PURCHASE HOMES. WITH THE HOMES

01:49:57.624 --> 01:49:58.892

THIS THE STATE PROGRAM OPERATES

01:50:52.712 --> 01:50:56.182
IS THAT. COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE

01:50:56.249 --> 01:50:59.786
NOT PASSED AND CANNOT PASS LOCAL

01:50:59.853 --> 01:51:01.721
BOND MEASURES TEND TO HAVE. THEY

01:51:01.788 --> 01:51:03.523
ALLOW THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO

01:51:03.590 --> 01:51:05.225
IMPOSE HIGHER IMPACT FEES. FOR

01:51:05.291 --> 01:51:07.594
SCHOOLS AND THAT THERE WAS A

01:51:07.660 --> 01:51:09.295
GREAT PROGRAM THAT KELLY TO PAY

01:51:09.362 --> 01:51:11.264
RAN THAT- COULD OFFSET THOSE

01:51:11.331 --> 01:51:13.333
COSTS BECAUSE WE SEE HIGHER

01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:16.836
SCHOOL IMPACT FEES IN RURAL

01:51:16.903 --> 01:51:18.938

MISTER COOPER IMPACT FEES ARE

01:51:21.574 --> 01:51:23.276
HUGE I CAME FROM A LOCAL CITY

01:51:23.343 --> 01:51:25.078
APPEAL GRILL I WAS R. FIFTEEN

01:51:25.145 --> 01:51:26.179
YEARS THE COUNCIL AND KNEW MY

01:51:26.246 --> 01:51:27.414

COUNCILS IN THE IMPACT FEES ARE

01:51:29.549 --> 01:51:31.918
A BIG SCHOOLS SEWER SO STORM

01:51:31.985 --> 01:51:33.987
DRAIN PARKS I MEAN YOU'RE

01:51:34.054 --> 01:51:35.789
TALKING THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:51:35.855 --> 01:51:37.357
IN FEES AND SOME THESE ISSUES.

01:51:37.424 --> 01:51:38.458
WHAT WE ALSO SAW WERE A LOT OF

01:51:38.525 --> 01:51:41.494
SEQUEL LAWSUIT AGAINST WORK- AND

01:51:41.561 --> 01:51:43.063
THAT REALLY HURT I MEAN IT

01:51:43.129 --> 01:51:44.931
REALLY DROVE DOWN AND-

01:51:44.998 --> 01:51:46.566
DISCOURAGE BILLS IN COMING IN

01:51:46.633 --> 01:51:48.701
THEIR BUILDING- CAN SOMEONE

01:51:48.768 --> 01:51:50.303
COMING ON THE NEED FOR SEEK

01:51:50.370 --> 01:51:51.938
REFORM IS PART OF THE SOLUTION

01:51:52.005 --> 01:51:55.408
TO INCREASE HEALTH AND SUPPLY

01:51:55.475 --> 01:51:56.443
LOWER THE COST OF HOUSING

01:51:56.509 --> 01:52:03.049
PRODUCTION. SOMEBODY ANYBODY BE

01:52:03.116 --> 01:52:07.020
WILLING TO STEP IN- SEQUEL IS-

01:52:07.087 --> 01:52:08.755
IT'LL ORIGINALLY WELL

01:52:08.822 --> 01:52:10.790
INTENTIONED LAW THAT WAS HAS

01:52:10.857 --> 01:52:13.093
REASONS TO YOU EXIST TO PROTECT

01:52:13.159 --> 01:52:15.095
THE ENVIRONMENT AND BLEEDING. WE

01:52:15.161 --> 01:52:17.263
SPEND A TON OF MONEY ON A SEQUIN

01:52:17.330 --> 01:52:19.399
HOUSES AND YARDS WHEN WE DO

01:52:19.466 --> 01:52:21.301
PROJECTS THEY HAVE TO BE VERY

01:52:21.367 --> 01:52:23.269
TIGHT BUT NOT TO GET PASSED THE

01:52:23.336 --> 01:52:25.038
SCRUTINY THE REVIEW AND APPROVAL

01:52:25.105 --> 01:52:28.374
PROCESS. BUT ANYONE CAN FILE A

01:52:28.441 --> 01:52:31.945
LAWSUIT AGAINST SUPER APPROVAL

01:52:32.011 --> 01:52:33.780
ANYONE FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER

01:52:33.847 --> 01:52:38.051
AND. MOST OF THOSE LAWSUITS ARE

01:52:38.118 --> 01:52:39.419
FILED BY. IT WAS JUST A QUESTION

01:52:39.486 --> 01:52:40.887
PARTY'S WITH QUESTIONS MOTIVES

01:52:40.954 --> 01:52:42.222
THEY'RE NOT REALLY TYPICALLY

01:52:42.288 --> 01:52:44.023
FROM NEIGHBORS WHO ARE OPPOSED

01:52:44.090 --> 01:52:45.492
TO PROJECT THEIR FILE BY PEOPLE

01:52:45.558 --> 01:52:48.328
THAT YOU HAVE. OTHER MOTIVES

01:52:48.394 --> 01:52:51.164
FRANKLY AND SO. BASICALLY THESE

01:52:51.231 --> 01:52:53.867
LAWSUITS YOU GET WORKED OUT AND

01:52:53.933 --> 01:52:55.602
SETTLED. IT COSTS MONEY TO DO

01:52:55.668 --> 01:52:58.037
THAT IN THE LOW EIGHTIES THE

01:52:58.104 --> 01:52:59.739
AVAILABILITY OF THE DELAYS THE

01:52:59.806 --> 01:53:00.907
OPPORTUNITY TO BRING THAT SUPPLY

01:53:00.974 --> 01:53:02.475
THE MARKET SO WHEN YOU RESTRICT

01:53:02.542 --> 01:53:04.844
SUPPLY IN ANY FASHION YOU'RE

01:53:04.911 --> 01:53:05.745
GOING TO REDUCE THE BELL

01:53:05.812 --> 01:53:07.380
BUILDING HOUSES AN INCREASE THE

01:53:07.447 --> 01:53:10.650
PRICE BECAUSE THERE'S DEMAND AND

01:53:10.717 --> 01:53:11.718
YOU CAN'T MEET THE DEMAND

01:53:11.784 --> 01:53:12.385
WITHOUT SUPPLY. SO THERE'S A LOT

01:53:12.452 --> 01:53:14.053
OF NEED FOR SIMPLE REFORM I

01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:15.355
THINK YOU'RE ALL AWARE OF THOSE

01:53:15.421 --> 01:53:17.357
ISSUES. SOONER OR LATER WE'RE

01:53:17.423 --> 01:53:18.825
GOING TO HAVE TO ADDRESS THEM

01:53:18.892 --> 01:53:19.792
WE'RE NOT GONNA SOLVE THIS

01:53:19.859 --> 01:53:21.995
PROBLEM. YES IT OBVIOUSLY WE

01:53:22.061 --> 01:53:23.229
HAVE SEVERAL BILLS PENDING A

01:53:23.296 --> 01:53:24.964
LEGISLATURE EXPANSE THE QUOTE.

01:53:25.031 --> 01:53:27.333
AND WE'VE HAD BILLS WERE FOLKS

01:53:27.400 --> 01:53:28.434
SOONER SEQUEL THAT DIDN'T LIVE

01:53:28.501 --> 01:53:30.336
IN THE CITY. OF THE RICH THE

01:53:30.403 --> 01:53:31.271
AFFECTED RESIDENTS I MEAN

01:53:31.337 --> 01:53:32.605
SOMEONE THAT CAME FROM HOUSE OF

01:53:32.672 --> 01:53:34.407
THE CITY IN THE SUIT. AND THAT'S

01:53:34.474 --> 01:53:36.042
THE STARTING SO SEQUELS AND

01:53:36.109 --> 01:53:40.480
POURED TOOL BUT. IT HAS BEEN

01:53:40.547 --> 01:53:42.115
RIPE FOR ABUSE THANK YOU. I HAVE

01:53:42.182 --> 01:53:43.116
A UP QUESTION I THINK YOU

01:53:43.183 --> 01:53:45.919
ANSWERED IT ASSEMBLY. COOPER BUT

01:53:45.985 --> 01:53:48.354
IN FACT IS THAT THE CASE WHICH I

01:53:48.421 --> 01:53:51.057
BELIEVE IS THAT ANYBODY CAN

01:53:51.124 --> 01:53:55.562
FILE- LAWSUIT UNDER SYKORA. THAT

01:53:55.628 --> 01:53:57.564
LIVES IN ANY PART OF THE STATE

01:53:57.630 --> 01:53:59.165
IN IT THEY DON'T HAVE TO LIVE IN

01:53:59.232 --> 01:54:03.803
THAT JURISDICTION IS THAT TRUE.

01:54:03.870 --> 01:54:08.641
ANYBODY. I'M NOT A SUPER TURNING

01:54:08.708 --> 01:54:10.043
BUT I BELIEVE THAT IS TRUE IN

01:54:10.109 --> 01:54:11.678
FACT AND THEY CAN BE FUNDED BY

01:54:11.744 --> 01:54:13.680
PEOPLE WHO DON'T EVEN LOOK AT

01:54:13.746 --> 01:54:16.549
THE STATE. RIGHT SO I'M GONNA

01:54:16.616 --> 01:54:18.284
CONTINUE NOT WHAT THE QUESTION

01:54:18.351 --> 01:54:21.888
BUT JUST A FEW COMMENTS- MMHM

01:54:21.955 --> 01:54:23.923
PLEASE INDULGE ME BUT YOU KNOW

01:54:23.990 --> 01:54:25.358
WE TRAVELED UP AND DOWN THE

01:54:25.425 --> 01:54:27.594
STATE DURING THE RECESS AS

01:54:27.660 --> 01:54:31.264
HOUSING- PARTIES OR INDIVIDUALS

01:54:31.331 --> 01:54:33.099
THAT WERE LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS

01:54:33.166 --> 01:54:35.501
TO THIS HOUSING CRISIS WE GOT A

01:54:35.568 --> 01:54:40.373
LOT OF GOOD INFORMATION- BUT AS

01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:42.575

01:54:42.642 --> 01:54:44.277
. YOU KNOW WE CAN DO MANY MANY

01:54:44.344 --> 01:54:45.878
THINGS AND WE ARE DOING THAT BUT

01:54:45.945 --> 01:54:47.780
NONE OF IT'S GOING TO SOLVE THIS

01:54:47.847 --> 01:54:50.883
HOUSING CRISIS IF WE CONTINUE

01:54:50.950 --> 01:54:53.219
NOT ONLY WITH SEEK WERE-

01:54:53.286 --> 01:54:56.322
LAWSUITS BUT CANCELS LOCAL

01:54:56.389 --> 01:54:58.891
COUNCILS AND JURISDICTIONS THAT

01:54:58.958 --> 01:55:01.127
KEEPS SAYING NO. AND WHAT WE DO

01:55:01.194 --> 01:55:03.329
AT THE STATE AND END UP IN MAN'S

01:55:03.396 --> 01:55:05.598
ESSENCE BECOMES A BANDAID TO

01:55:05.665 --> 01:55:07.066
TRYING TO FIX WHAT WE'RE NOT

01:55:07.133 --> 01:55:07.900
DOING THAT THE LOCAL

01:55:07.967 --> 01:55:11.271
JURISDICTION AND MANY MANYTIMES

IN YOUR LANE THINGS LIKE THIS

01:55:24.584 --> 01:55:26.786
BUT THEN THE RESPONSE BACK IS IF

01:55:26.853 --> 01:55:28.988
WE HAVE COUNCILS THAT GO THROUGH

01:55:29.055 --> 01:55:31.591
THE PROCESS THE PROJECT COMES TO

01:55:31.658 --> 01:55:33.693
THE PLANNING COMMISSION. GOES

01:55:33.760 --> 01:55:36.462
THROUGH THOSE PROCESSES APPROVED

01:55:36.529 --> 01:55:38.665
GET STATE COUNCIL. AND THEN THAT

01:55:38.731 --> 01:55:40.266
COUNCIL BECAUSE TWO HUNDRED

01:55:40.333 --> 01:55:41.734
PEOPLE SHOW UP SAYING NO WE

01:55:41.801 --> 01:55:43.169
DON'T WANT THIS IN OUR BACKYARD

01:55:43.236 --> 01:55:46.139
NIMBYS THEY TABLE IT PUSH IT

BASICALLY PUTTING OFF AND ELAINE

01:55:51.611 --> 01:55:53.646
AND WHAT WE ARE IN FACT DOING.

01:55:53.713 --> 01:55:56.749
IS PUSHING A PROJECTS SOMETIMES

01:55:56.816 --> 01:55:59.085
TWO YEARS BACK. AND THIS IS IN

01:55:59.152 --> 01:56:00.486
FACT ONE OF THE NUMBER ONE

01:56:00.553 --> 01:56:02.255
PROBLEMS WE HAVE SO WE CAN SAY

01:56:02.322 --> 01:56:04.490
WELL IT'S SB NINE THAT'S TOO

01:56:04.557 --> 01:56:06.893
MUCH FOR THIS BUT WE ARE NOT

SAYING YES. WE'RE NOT SAYING YES

01:56:09.362 --> 01:56:11.264
TO HOUSING AND THEN THE WHOLE

01:56:11.331 --> 01:56:13.399
OTHER IN PART IN THIS BECAUSE I

01:56:13.466 --> 01:56:15.601

01:56:15.668 --> 01:56:17.570
YOU HAVE HEARD THIS IS MY- PHONE

01:56:17.637 --> 01:56:19.472
GOING TO GO OUT IT. I TOOK A

01:56:19.539 --> 01:56:21.274
WALK AROUND THE CAPITAL THIS

01:56:21.341 --> 01:56:24.410
MORNING I COUNTED. ABOUT FIFTEEN

01:56:24.477 --> 01:56:27.613
TENS IT WAS SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE

01:56:27.680 --> 01:56:29.082
MORNING. PEOPLE ARE GETTING UP

01:56:29.148 --> 01:56:30.717
STARTING THEIR DAY AND WHAT DO

01:56:30.783 --> 01:56:32.852
PEOPLE DO WHEN THEY GET UP IN

01:56:32.919 --> 01:56:33.886
THE MORNING WHAT'S THE FIRST

01:56:33.953 --> 01:56:36.723
THING YOU DO. SORRY GUYS WE

01:56:36.789 --> 01:56:38.224
DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT BUT

01:56:38.291 --> 01:56:40.460
YOU GO TO THE BATHROOM. AND IF

01:56:40.526 --> 01:56:42.695
WE HAVE PEOPLE THOUSANDS OF

01:56:42.762 --> 01:56:43.996
PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE OF

01:56:44.063 --> 01:56:46.499
CALIFORNIA LIVING ON THE STREETS

01:56:46.566 --> 01:56:48.234
WITH NO PUBLIC BATHROOMS. WHERE

01:56:48.301 --> 01:56:50.636
ARE THEY GOING. SO THAT'S THE

01:56:50.703 --> 01:56:52.705
SANITATION ISSUE BUT THE POINT

01:56:52.772 --> 01:56:54.340
IS IT'S GOOD WE DON'T HAVE

01:56:54.407 --> 01:56:56.242
HOUSING AND WE'RE NOT SAYING

01:56:56.309 --> 01:56:59.112
YES. AND THE STATE US HERE IN

01:56:59.178 --> 01:57:01.981
THIS ROOM GET A LOT OF FLAK FOR

01:57:02.048 --> 01:57:03.015
SAYING WE'RE GOING TO MOVE

01:57:03.082 --> 01:57:05.084
FORWARD. BUT THE TRUTH IS OUR

01:57:05.151 --> 01:57:06.486
JOB IS REALLY TO STAY IN OUR

01:57:06.552 --> 01:57:08.254
LANE BUT IF LOCALS ARE GOING TO

01:57:08.321 --> 01:57:11.190
DO THEIR JOB. WE HAVE TO STEP IN

01:57:11.257 --> 01:57:13.559
I'M SORRY. WE HAVE TO SAY YES TO

01:57:13.626 --> 01:57:15.661
HOUSING AND WE HAVE TO BE ABLE

01:57:15.728 --> 01:57:17.864
TO GIVE PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY.

01:57:17.930 --> 01:57:19.899
TO BE ABLE TO LIVE IN HOMES THAT

01:57:19.966 --> 01:57:24.036
ARE AFFORDABLE. SO ALL WE CAN DO

01:57:24.103 --> 01:57:26.539
IS LISTEN TAKE THE ADVICE HERE

01:57:26.606 --> 01:57:28.307
TRY TO PUT FORWARD BILLS BUT I

01:57:28.374 --> 01:57:30.176
ASK OUR COLLEAGUES AND THOSE OF

01:57:30.243 --> 01:57:32.011

01:57:38.651 --> 01:57:40.553
SAY I AGREE YES TO HOUSING.

01:57:40.620 --> 01:57:43.389
MISTER SERRA. OKAY SO WE'RE

01:57:43.456 --> 01:57:44.524
GONNA WE GOT INTO THAT

01:57:44.590 --> 01:57:45.458
DISCUSSION WE'RE GONNA HAVE A

01:57:45.525 --> 01:57:46.826
LITTLE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE

01:57:46.893 --> 01:57:48.895
FROM THE LOCAL LEVEL- LOCAL

01:57:48.961 --> 01:57:51.197
AGENCIES HAVE NO PROBLEMS HAVE

01:57:51.264 --> 01:57:52.265
APPROVING HOUSING WHAT THEY HAVE

01:57:52.331 --> 01:57:54.467
PROBLEMS WITH. IS WHEN THEY ARE

01:57:54.534 --> 01:57:56.335
HANDED A BAG OF REGULATIONS THAT

01:57:56.402 --> 01:57:58.271
CAN TAKE UP TO TEN YEARS FOR

01:57:58.337 --> 01:57:59.705
STUDIES AND EVERYTHING ELSE TO

01:57:59.772 --> 01:58:03.075
GET THROUGH A PROCESS. AND THEY

01:58:03.142 --> 01:58:04.177
HAVE LIMITED STAFF TO BE ABLE TO

01:58:04.243 --> 01:58:08.114
DO IT- THAT STUFF COMES FROM US-AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE TALKING

01:58:08.181 --> 01:58:09.849
ABOUT WHEN THEY SAY HEY YOU KNOW

01:58:09.916 --> 01:58:11.818
WHAT. ENOUGH MANDATES ALREADY.

01:58:11.884 --> 01:58:13.152
BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE THINGS

01:58:13.219 --> 01:58:16.055
THAT. WHEN YOU DO A STUDY THAT

01:58:16.122 --> 01:58:18.291
TAKES THREE YEARS. AND THEN THE

01:58:18.357 --> 01:58:21.561
OTHER STUDIES WITH THAT YOU DID

01:58:21.627 --> 01:58:23.930
EARLIER ON BECOME OBSOLETE. ALL

01:58:23.996 --> 01:58:25.598
THOSE CITIES ARE DOING IS TRYING

01:58:25.665 --> 01:58:27.633
TO KEEP UP WITH THE REGULATIONS

01:58:27.700 --> 01:58:29.535
AND BEING ABLE TO GET A PROJECT

01:58:29.602 --> 01:58:31.537
THROUGH WITHOUT IT BEING

01:58:31.604 --> 01:58:32.705
CHALLENGED BY SEQUEL AT THE END

01:58:32.772 --> 01:58:35.174
OF THE DAY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT

01:58:35.241 --> 01:58:36.442
THAT'S WHAT THE BIG HOLD UP IS.

01:58:36.509 --> 01:58:38.110
OF A LOT OF CITIES OUR MASTER

01:58:38.177 --> 01:58:39.345
PLAN CITIES THEY WENT THROUGH A

01:58:39.412 --> 01:58:41.013
PROCESS BECAUSE AS WE ARE

01:58:41.080 --> 01:58:42.849
TALKING BUT WE HAVE GROWTH RINGS

01:58:42.915 --> 01:58:44.584
AND EACH EACH RAIN LEARNED FROM

01:58:44.650 --> 01:58:46.719
THE LAST RAIN WHAT WORKS AND

01:58:46.786 --> 01:58:48.588
WHAT DOESN'T AND HOW YOU LAY OUT

01:58:48.654 --> 01:58:50.389
A CITY. AND THOSE THOSE

01:58:50.456 --> 01:58:52.358
APPROVALS GO THROUGH EIGHT CD

01:58:52.425 --> 01:58:54.126
YOU CAN'T GET AN APPROVAL FOR

01:58:54.193 --> 01:58:56.362
YOUR HOUSING ELEMENT IF YOU

01:58:56.429 --> 01:58:57.363
DON'T HAVE CERTAIN ELEMENTS IN

01:58:57.430 --> 01:59:00.299
IT. BUT YOU CAN'T CITIES DON'T

01:59:00.366 --> 01:59:02.168
BUILD HOMES. BUILDERS BUILD

01:59:02.235 --> 01:59:04.537
HOMES. AND THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN

01:59:04.604 --> 01:59:07.306
BUILD IS IF THEY HOUSING. IS IF

01:59:07.373 --> 01:59:09.275
THEY'RE OUT DO YOU GUYS WANT ME

01:59:09.342 --> 01:59:10.910
TO STOP. OKAY BUT IT DID LOOK

01:59:10.977 --> 01:59:13.946
LIKE WE DID. SO IT'S THERE'S A

01:59:14.013 --> 01:59:15.882
COMBINATION OF PROBLEMS HERE BUT

01:59:15.948 --> 01:59:17.250
THE OTHER THING WE HAVE TO KEEP

01:59:17.316 --> 01:59:19.485
UNDER CONSIDERATION. IS AS WE GO

01:59:19.552 --> 01:59:21.053
OUT AND ALLOW HOUSING INTO THOSE

01:59:21.120 --> 01:59:23.856
GROWTH RANGE WHICH WE NEED TO

01:59:23.923 --> 01:59:25.124
DESPERATELY. WE ALSO HAVE TO

01:59:25.191 --> 01:59:26.993
HAVE A BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT THAT

01:59:27.059 --> 01:59:29.762
ENCOURAGES JOBS IN THOSE AREAS.

01:59:29.829 --> 01:59:30.329
BECAUSE OTHERWISE ALL THOSE

01:59:30.396 --> 01:59:32.031
PEOPLE CAN BE DRIVING. ALL THOSE

01:59:32.098 --> 01:59:33.599
PEOPLE HAVE 61% OF THE AREA

01:59:33.666 --> 01:59:36.168
PEOPLE IN MY REGION. COMMUTE TWO

01:59:36.235 --> 01:59:39.438
HOURS TO GO GET A JOB ATTEMPT TO

01:59:39.505 --> 01:59:40.640
WORK. THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE

01:59:40.706 --> 01:59:42.642
ENVIRONMENT. SO WE KEEP WORKING

01:59:42.708 --> 01:59:44.076
AGAINST OURSELVES BECAUSE WE

01:59:44.143 --> 01:59:47.246
LIMIT LIMIT ARE JOB CREATION. WE

01:59:47.313 --> 01:59:48.915
HAVE MORE ENVIRONMENT WITH VAMP

01:59:48.981 --> 01:59:51.017
BAYERN MENTAL RESTRICTIONS AND

01:59:51.083 --> 01:59:53.352
THERE WE WANT MORE HOUSING WHICH

01:59:53.419 --> 01:59:55.922
WE NEED DESPERATELY. AND YET WE

01:59:55.988 --> 01:59:57.456
PILE A BUNCH OF RESTRICTIONS ON

01:59:57.523 --> 01:59:59.625
THAT VERY HOUSING FOR THE CITY'S

01:59:59.692 --> 02:00:00.960
TO BE THE REFEREE AND THEN WE

02:00:01.027 --> 02:00:02.795
BLAME THE CITIES BECAUSE THEY'RE

02:00:02.862 --> 02:00:03.596
NOT DOING WHAT WE THINK THEY

02:00:03.663 --> 02:00:05.665
SHOULD BE DOING. THEY'RE TRYING

02:00:05.731 --> 02:00:07.567
THEY REALLY ARE AND IF YOU WANT

02:00:07.633 --> 02:00:08.901
TO COME DOWN TO MY REGIONAL GIVE

02:00:08.968 --> 02:00:10.369
YOU A GOOD TOUR THE CITY IS

02:00:10.436 --> 02:00:11.671
GOING TO BUILD HOUSING BUT THEY

02:00:11.737 --> 02:00:13.539
DO HAVE AN APPROVAL AND THEY

02:00:13.606 --> 02:00:15.474
HAVE THREE VOTES OUT OF FIVE TO

02:00:15.541 --> 02:00:17.109
SAY YES AND MANY OF THEM DON'T

02:00:17.176 --> 02:00:18.844
TAKE THAT AND WE HAVE THAT CAN

02:00:18.911 --> 02:00:20.379
WIN THE WORLD DOING A REMODELING

02:00:20.446 --> 02:00:22.248
WE HAVE A CHOICE. CHECK FOR

02:00:22.315 --> 02:00:23.149
TWENTY YEARS WE'RE ALSO IN A

02:00:23.215 --> 02:00:24.984
REMOTE WORKING ENVIRONMENT WHERE

02:00:25.051 --> 02:00:25.985
MORE AND MORE PEOPLE CAN WORK

02:00:26.052 --> 02:00:27.620
FROM HOME SO WE GOT TO HAVE IT

02:00:27.687 --> 02:00:30.022
AS WELL. I DON'T FEEL SORRY FOR

02:00:30.089 --> 02:00:31.390
LOW COLLECTORS WHO WON'T DO

02:00:31.457 --> 02:00:33.559
THEIR JOBS SORRY CAN WE JUST-

02:00:33.626 --> 02:00:34.594
BRING IT BACK HERE TO SEE IF

02:00:34.660 --> 02:00:35.795
THERE'S ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR

02:00:35.861 --> 02:00:41.067
THE- COMMITTEE OR THE THAT THE-

02:00:41.133 --> 02:00:42.101
FOLKS WERE TESTIFYING. ANY OTHER

02:00:42.168 --> 02:00:44.537
QUESTIONS. MISTER KALRA. BUT I

02:00:44.604 --> 02:00:48.074
YOU KNOW I. THINK THAT I JUST.

02:00:48.140 --> 02:00:49.775
R. S. TO CHIME IN AND SOME OF

02:00:49.842 --> 02:00:51.611
OUR COLLEAGUE FROM. ORANGE

02:00:51.677 --> 02:00:53.913
COUNTY I SERVED ON THE CITY

02:00:53.980 --> 02:00:54.780
COUNCIL OF A MAJOR CITY FOR

02:00:54.847 --> 02:00:56.315
EIGHT YEARS WHEN WE WERE THE

02:00:56.382 --> 02:00:58.484
ONLY ONES BUILDING ALL THE TOWNS

02:00:58.551 --> 02:00:59.819
AROUND US AND NOTHING TO DO WITH

02:00:59.885 --> 02:01:01.487
. WHAT WITH BARACK RECEIVE A

02:01:01.554 --> 02:01:02.855
REGULATION OR ANYTHING THE

02:01:02.922 --> 02:01:04.824
REALITY IS THAT THEY JUST DON'T

02:01:04.890 --> 02:01:06.759
WANNA BUILD. I WAS ON A ON A BAG

02:01:06.826 --> 02:01:08.894
. NOW THEY WERE GIVEN A- GIVEN A

02:01:08.961 --> 02:01:10.730
ON HOUSING ALL THE SMALL TOWNS

02:01:10.796 --> 02:01:11.998
GET OUT SO THEY DIDN'T CARE.

02:01:12.064 --> 02:01:12.698
BECAUSE THERE IS NO

02:01:12.765 --> 02:01:15.167
ACCOUNTABILITY- THE JOBS ARE

02:01:15.234 --> 02:01:15.768
BEING CREATED APPLE

02:01:15.835 --> 02:01:17.603
HEADQUARTERS. ONE OF THE MOST

02:01:17.670 --> 02:01:20.539
SIGNIFICANT- AND INDUSTRIAL

02:01:20.606 --> 02:01:22.141
OFFICE COMPLEXES BUILT IN THE

02:01:22.208 --> 02:01:24.844
LAST. TWO DECADES. AND THAT SAME

02:01:24.910 --> 02:01:26.746
CITY BLOCK ANY OFFICER HOUSING

02:01:26.812 --> 02:01:28.648
UNTIL SB THIRTY FIVE WAS PASSED

02:01:28.714 --> 02:01:29.982
AND WE FINALLY HAD A CHANCE. TO

02:01:30.049 --> 02:01:31.283
BUILD HOUSES HOUSING DOWN THE

02:01:31.350 --> 02:01:32.852
STREET WITH APPLE HEADQUARTERS

02:01:32.918 --> 02:01:39.025
SO- THERE THERE'S- MATH. THAT

02:01:39.091 --> 02:01:40.259
GETS REPEATED THAT THE STATE IS.

02:01:40.326 --> 02:01:41.627
YOUR MEDDLING AT A LOCAL LEVEL

02:01:41.694 --> 02:01:43.262
THE REALITIES OF THE LOCAL LEVEL

02:01:43.329 --> 02:01:43.963
THEY'VE ABDICATED THE

02:01:44.030 --> 02:01:46.132
RESPONSIBILITY. STATES FAR TOO

02:01:46.198 --> 02:01:48.467
MANY OF THE SMALL TOWNS. AND

02:01:48.534 --> 02:01:49.402
SMALL CITIES DO NOT WANT TO

02:01:49.468 --> 02:01:52.071
BUILD. AND I'VE SEEN IT YOUR

02:01:52.138 --> 02:01:53.272
WITH SILICON VALLEY IS THE

02:01:53.339 --> 02:01:55.207
ECONOMIC ENGINE OF NOT JUST THE

02:01:55.274 --> 02:01:56.742
STATE BUT THE COUNTRY. SO JOBS

02:01:56.809 --> 02:01:58.377
ARE THERE GREAT JOBS ARE THERE

02:01:58.444 --> 02:02:00.513
PEOPLE HAVE MONEY. THE PROBLEM

02:02:00.579 --> 02:02:01.280
IS THAT THERE ARE ENOUGH HOMES

02:02:01.347 --> 02:02:02.882
PEOPLE TO BUY. THAT IS BECAUSE

02:02:02.948 --> 02:02:06.185
THE SMALL SMALLER TOWNS IN

02:02:06.252 --> 02:02:07.153
JURISDICTIONS THINK IT'S JUST

02:02:07.219 --> 02:02:08.387
THE RESPONSIBILITY. OF SAN

02:02:08.454 --> 02:02:09.955
FRANCISCO THOUSAND OPEN TO BUILD

02:02:10.022 --> 02:02:11.791
AND NOBODY ELSE'S. IT DOESN'T

02:02:11.857 --> 02:02:13.259
WORK THAT WAY EVERYONE HAS TO

02:02:13.325 --> 02:02:15.528
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. AND WE MADE

02:02:15.594 --> 02:02:17.129
IT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE IN TERMS

02:02:17.196 --> 02:02:19.765
OF FACILITATING- THE HIGHER

02:02:19.832 --> 02:02:21.200
DENSITY FACILITATING TRANSIT

02:02:21.267 --> 02:02:22.968
ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT. THEY STILL

02:02:23.035 --> 02:02:24.870
DON'T WANT ANY BETTER THAN THE

02:02:24.937 --> 02:02:26.305
DAY- THEY DON'T WANT TO BE TOLD

02:02:26.372 --> 02:02:27.873
WHAT TO DO BUT THEY'RE NOT

02:02:27.940 --> 02:02:29.208
TAKING ON THE RESPONSIBILITY. OF

02:02:29.275 --> 02:02:31.477
DEALING WITH THESE WE ISSUE. AND

STATE LEVEL AND LOOK. TOWARDS

02:07:57.369 --> 02:07:59.738
MAKING FUNDING DECISIONS FOR THE

FUTURE. SHOULD STATE FUNDING

02:08:02.107 --> 02:08:04.710
FOCUS ON CREATING MORE SUPPLY OF

02:08:04.777 --> 02:08:06.645
OWNERSHIP AND IF SO AT WHAT

02:08:06.712 --> 02:08:09.648
LEVELS. AND HOW FAST DOES IT

02:08:09.715 --> 02:08:12.184
TAKE TO BUILD. IF ANYONE IN THE

02:08:12.251 --> 02:08:14.520

INVESTMENT IN HOMEOWNERSHIP IS.

02:08:30.736 --> 02:08:33.772
TINY TO NONEXISTENT SO WE NEED

02:08:33.839 --> 02:08:35.307
TO INCREASE THE SUPPLY AND THAT

02:08:35.374 --> 02:08:36.542
WILL MAKE AN ENORMOUS DIFFERENCE

02:08:36.608 --> 02:08:38.710
IN BALANCING. THE

02:08:38.777 --> 02:08:42.014
UNAFFORDABILITY. I THINK I'VE I

02:08:42.081 --> 02:08:45.551
WOULD SECOND THAT AND- ALSO SAY

02:08:45.617 --> 02:08:48.153
THAT. IF THE STATE COULD

02:08:48.220 --> 02:08:52.291

ARE VERY BENEFICIAL AND WELL

02:09:25.290 --> 02:09:27.292
DESIGNED IT NEEDS SUPPORT. IF

02:09:27.359 --> 02:09:30.062
YOU DON'T INCREASE SUPPLY. JUST

02:09:30.129 --> 02:09:31.730
POURING MORE MONEY INTO THE SAME
