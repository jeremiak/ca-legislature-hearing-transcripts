HEARD BEFORE IT'S A DISTRICT BILL AMENDED TO BE CLEAR TO CLEAR UP THE AMBIGUITY BY AUTHORIZING NOT REQUIRING THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PARKS TO SELL THE ALAMEDA TEST EXPANSIONARY OF THE CARNEGIE STATE. RECREATION AREA IF THE SALE IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC. THIS AREAS RICH IN BIOLOGICAL AND CULTURAL HISTORY AND THE SALE OF THE LAND WOULD PROVIDE PROJECT PROTECTIONS AND ALLOW ALL VISITORS TO ACCESS AND ENJOY THE LAND. AS A BILL STATES THE LAND SHALL NOT BE SOLD FOR LESS THAN WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY PAID. AND THE PROCEEDS OF THE SALE SHALL GO TO THE OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE TRUST FUND ALSO I WANT TO NOTE THAT THE BILL DOES NOT AFFECT THE CURRENT CARNEGIE. PARK IT IS IN ACTIVE USE AND WILL REMAIN ACTIVE USE DESPITE WHAT STATE PARKS DECIDES TO DO WITH THIS PLANT. THE BILL ENJOYS BROAD SUPPORT INCLUDING SIERRA CLUB COUNTY OF ALAMEDA EAST BAY WE- ARE DISTRICT THE SOCIETY OF AMERICAN INDIANS AND OTHERS. AND WILL TURN OVER SENATOR GLAZERS CONSCIOUS TO THANK ASSEMBLY WOMAN THAT FOR. HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS AND DASTARDLY CENTER Y. CASKEY. FOR HIS HELP ON THIS HAPPY ANSWER QUESTIONS. YEAH WITNESSES. GOOD MORNING BRIAN DAWSON WITH ZERO CALIFORNIA ON BEHALF OF OUR FIVE HUNDRED MILLION I MEAN FIVE SORRY HALF MILLION MEMBERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NOT FIVE ON A MILLION WE HAVE A LOT OF US HERE COULD LEADERS ARE VOLUNTEERS IN THE ALAMEDA COUNTY SINCE ABOUT THE WORKING ON THIS FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS AND WHILE BOTH THE SENATOR AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF SPOKE TO THE ECOLOGICAL VALUE THAT THIS LAND HAS I JUST WANNA KNOW THE FISCAL IMPACT THAT THIS WOULD HAVE. CURRENTLY THE LAND IS BEEN TIED UP IN LITIGATION FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS AND SINCE THE FIRST ATTEMPT IN SO THE CITY HAS BEEN PAYING THAT AND- THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW THE. IT'S SO WITH THAT I PROTECT THE ANSWER I VOTE THANK YOU. SUPPORT MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MONICA MILLER REPRESENT THE COUNTY ALAMEDA IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. MORNING MR TURN SENATORS LUCAS FRERICHS ABOUT THE NATURE CONSERVANCY IN STRONG SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING WAS ADJOURNMENT SENATORS I'LL PUT IT ON THE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA NATIVE PLANT SOCIETY AS WELL AS ON ONE CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. SOP POSITION. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. MORE THAN ONE. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE CAME SOMBART ON BEHALF OF THE BAY TO CALIFORNIA FOR RECYCLE USERS AND ACCOUNT FOR MOTORCYCLE DEALERS ASSOCIATION THIS BILL HAS BEEN A PART OF SENATE BILL TWO FORTY NINE AND ONE FIFTY NINE BY SENATOR ALAN. AND THAT WAS OF COURSE THE REASON TO CONTINUE THE OFFROAD PROGRAM ON A STATEWIDE BASIS AND THIS WAS ONE PART OF THAT BILL AND AT THE END WHEN WE ALL CAME TO HAVE A COMPROMISE WE TOOK THIS PORTION OF THE BILL OUT. BECAUSE IT WAS A LOCAL ISSUE. IT ISN'T JUST A LOCAL ISSUE MAYBE THE LAND'S LOCALLY BUT USERS FROM ALL OVER THE REGION COME IN IN USES PARK. PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COMMITTING USES PARK. SO TO CALL THE LOCAL ISSUES I THINK A LITTLE OVERSTATED I WILL SAY ON A FISCAL RACES BECAUSE THAT IS THE ARGUMENT WE'RE HERE TO FOR TODAY. IS A DECEPTION SECTION. TWO SAYS THAT THE BUSINESS SECTION TO SECTION TWO OF THE BILL AND SECTION FIFTY NINETY POINT FOUR TWO CALLS FOR THE SALE OF THE LAND TO BE AT THE PURCHASE PRICE THE PURCHASE PRICE WAS THIRTY YEARS AGO. I THAT WAS NINE MILLION DOLLARS I THINK THE WAY THAT STATE LAND IS DISPOSED OF SHOULD BE AT A FAIR MARKET APPRAISAL RATE WHY SHOULD THE OFFROAD FIND BE DENIED THE MANY VETS AT THAT'S- APPROPRIATE NINE MILLION DOLLARS MILLION DOLLARS AS AN BY THAT MUCH IN TODAY'S MARKET. REASONABLE APPRAISAL WE'VE BEEN TOLD IS BETWEEN TWENTY SEVEN AND FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. SO IF THEY'RE GOING TO. PURCHASE THIS LAND THEN THEY SHOULD BE PAYING BACK TO THE FIND OF THE OF THE CURRENT PRICE OF THE LAND THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CAPITAL INTERPRETING THE OFF ROAD VEHICLE LEGISLATIVE COALITION HEADQUARTERED IN SAN DIEGO UNFORTUNATELY WENT OVER HER TO OPPOSE THIS BILL I AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE EARLIER ABOUT THE AGREEMENT THAT WE ALL MADE AND SENATOR ALLEN'S BILL JUST A FEW YEARS AGO. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THIS IS THE STATE PARTY AND THIS IS A BAD PRECEDENT IF THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME ACCOMMODATION THEN IT NEEDS TO BE PRESENTED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. AND BY STATE PARKS AND THIS BILL HAS NO RELIEF IN IT FOR THE DRIVERS AND THE- OFF ROADERS IN THE BILL THIS IS ALSO A BILL FROM A PROCESS POINT OF VIEW THAT I FIND VERY FRUSTRATING THIS IS THE BILL. THAT MISTER. THAT WAS PUT ON SUSPEND ITS IN HOUSE AND THEN IT WAS LEFT ON SUSPENSE IN THE ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE AND NOW WE ARE FOR THE GOT AMEND. THAT TO ME IS A KIND OF GOES AROUND THE PROCESS AND IT CERTAINLY DISENFRANCHISES THE MANY MANY MANY DRIVERS WHO CAME UP. DURING THE POLICY DISCUSSIONS ON THIS BILL THIS YEAR. PRESS THIS WEEK OF LEGISLATIVE WITHOUT WEEKS VIRGIN NO VOTE AND URGED THE ADMINISTRATION AND PARKS TOM CONTINUES TO EXPLORE THIS ISSUE FOR REMEDY FOR ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE FINANCE. I WOULD NOTE THAT THE FISCAL IMPACT OF THIS BILL IS UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME AS IT IS UNCLEAR HOW MANY POTENTIAL BUYERS EXIST AND WHAT PORTION OF THE ROUGHLY THIRTY ONE HUNDRED ACRES WOULD BE PURCHASED WOULD KNOW THAT THE ALAMEDA TESLA EXPANSION AREA WAS PURCHASED THROUGH A SERIES OF TRANSACTIONS TOTALING APPROXIMATELY NINE MILLION DOLLARS WITH THE MOST RESPECT TRANSACTION CONCLUDING ROUGHLY TWENTY YEARS AGO. I'M SELLING THE PROPERTY OF THE ORIGINAL PURCHASE PRICE WOULD FEEL CAPTURE ANY INCREASE IN THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY OVER TIME WHICH WOULD RESULT IN POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT LOSS TO THE STATE AS THE BILL INCLUDES A RESTRICTION LIMITING THE SALE OF THE PROPERTY TO AGENCIES AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS FOR USE AS A PARK OR OTHER OKAY SPACE PURPOSE IT IS ALSO UNLIKELY THE TAIL PRICE OF THE PROPERTY WOULD REACH FAIR MARKET VALUE. A TO THE EXTENT PRETTY IS SOLD THE PROCEEDS LET THE PORTION USED TO REIMBURSE COSTS INCURRED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES WILL BE DEPOSITED IN THE HIGHWAY VEHICLE TRUST FUND OF LASTLY THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION ESTIMATES THE COST OF HOLDING THE SERIES OF PUBLIC THINGS. RUBBING THE BILL WOULD COST APPROXIMATELY FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM. THANK YOU. SO WHAT I'M OPPOSITION HAS ASKED ME TO LOOK AT A PAGE. TWO AND THREE PARAGRAPH OR SECTION TWO AND AS I READ IT THE LAND SHALL BE SOLD FOR NO LESS THAN THE ORIGINAL PRICE. SO THE NINE MILLION DOLLARS IS NOT DIG CEILING. IT'S THE FLOOR IS THAT THE AUTHORS UNDERSTANDING. AS THANK YOU SENATOR Y. CASKEY M. FOR THAT CLARIFICATION. THE BILL MERELY SAYS THE LAND SHOULD BE SOLD FOR NO LESS THAN THE ORIGINAL PURCHASE PRICE AS YOU POINTED OUT SO NINE MILLION IS THEM. AND THEN THEY WILL GET BUT THEY CAN ABSOLUTELY GET MORE. I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THIS IS AN EXTREMELY RURAL PART OF OUR DISTRICT THAT IS OWNED IN A WAY THAT IS NOT AMENABLE TO. DEVELOPMENT OR ANYTHING THAT WOULD BRING IT TO THE PURCHASE PRICE OF LAND ELSEWHERE IN THE BAY AREA BUT- THE BILL WOULD NOT STOP PARKS FROM SELLING FOR MORE THAN THE ORIGINAL PURCHASE. NOW ALSO I THINK YOUR OPENING YOU TALKED ABOUT THIS IS A MERE AUTHORIZATION FOR TSG TO GO AND SO THIS IS WE WOULD ANTICIPATE THAT THERE WOULD BE. NEGOTIATIONS ON THE ACTUAL SALES PRICE IS THAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THIS BILL WOULD WORK. YES AND ALSO POINT OUT THAT AND YOU KNOW THE OPPOSITE AND- LOCAL ABOUT THE AUTHORITY OF STATE PARKS IN OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND THIS BILL IS MERELY AN OPTION FOR THEM TO STOP. WE ARE NOT. MANDATING ANYTHING AND SO THEY WERE TAKING THE AUTHORITY THAT. THE OPPOSITION WOULD LIKE TO SEE EVEN IF THIS BILL PASSES. CURRENT LAW CURRENT. LAW IS A TWO DAY ALLOWS WHEN THE STATE IS DISPOSING OF EXCESS PROPERTY. TO REACH OUT TO OTHER PUBLIC AGENCIES THAT MIGHT BE. MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN IT I JUST HAPPEN IN MY DISTRICT WE- THE AGNEW STATE HOSPITAL WHICH HAD. WHICH WAS PURCHASED BY THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THE- CITY SAN JOSE FOR RECREATIONAL PURPOSES. THE STATE LAW CURRENTLY ALLOWS FOR DISCOUNT IF THE PURCHASE THAT IS GOING TO BE FOR PUBLIC USE. AND THERE'S GONNA BE A RECREATIONAL ELEMENT OR PARKS ELEMENT IS THAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE CURRENT STATE LAW ALSO. JUST YOU SENATOR AND I DON'T KNOW SENATOR GLAZER KNOWS MORE ABOUT THIS I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT PART OF A LOT BUT- I MEAN THIS WOULD NOT ALLOWED FOR. THIS WOULD NOT ALLOW FOR TO BE SOLD FOR LAST AND THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THAT DISCOUNT WOULD. THERE'S BEEN A FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLAR FIGURE OUT HERE IN A NINE MILLION DOLLAR FIGURE IN JUST SO WE'RE ALL CERTAIN THAT THE STATE LAW. ALLOWS WHEN YOU'RE SELLING TO A PUBLIC ENTITY THAT YOU CAN GIVE A DISCOUNT BECAUSE OF THE DESIRABILITY WE HAVE AN OPEN SPACE. UNFORTUNATELY IT DOES NOT ALLOW FOR THE SAME DESCRIPTORS JOB. DISTRICTS BECAUSE WHEN IN OUR- EAGERNESS TO BALANCE THE BUDGET IN TWO THOUSAND NINE WE TOOK THAT PROVISION OUT I KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BALANCE. FOR FINANCE HAVE A QUESTION MISTER CHAIR. IS THE CURRENT LITIGATIONS. TESTIMONY WAS A CURRENTLY THE CATION IS COSTING THE STATE. THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OR MONEY EACH YEAR AND THAT THE KINKS SAILOR CONCLUSION OF THE RELEASE OF THIS PROPERTY WHICH STOP THAT BLEEDING IS THAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING ALSO. ACTUALLY I WOULD HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT SENATOR WHICH IS IT GETTING BACK TO THAT WHAT THE ACTUAL AMOUNT HAS BEEN THAT WE'VE SPENT OVER LAST TWENTY YEARS IN LITIGATION OR THAT IT WOULD NOT STOP. AS THE BULLS I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH WE SPENT TO DATE ON MEDICATION AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT WAS STOP AS OF. THAT POINT THE USES OF THIS WE'RE MEASURING THE FIFTH. TO THE FIFTH. EIGHT WILL BE THAT WOULD BE A COST THAT WE WOULDN'T OCCUR ALTHOUGH. IT SEEMS REASONABLE THAT SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT THE STAFF REPORT PUTS IN FOR THIS. YOU KNOW. THE SALE OF PROPERTY WHICH WOULD BE REIMBURSABLE FROM THE VEHICLE FUND. SEEMS NORMAL YES THAT IS THAT IS THE USUAL PROCESS. THAT'S IT MISTER NOW WITH THAT MOVE IT. I HAVE A MOTION MISTER JONES HAD A QUESTION I'M GOING TO MISS BATES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I'M PUSHING MISS RIGHT COUNTY'S LAND QUESTIONI THINK THOSE WERE YOU KNOW A REALLY GOOD. BACK UP TO HAVE. I'VE SPOKE ON THIS OR JUST WANTING. LARGE AND MS LYNCH. KIND OF SUMMARIZE MY. TURNS BEFORE BUT NEW. AND MISS RIGHT COUNTY KIND OF CAMP DONALD A TWO DIMENSIONAL MORROW. MENTIONED THE YOU KNOW THE POTENTIAL SALES PRICE OF THIS. AND SO OF COURSE I'M HOPING THAT IT DOESN'T GET SOLD. BUT IF IT DOES GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS. YOU KNOW AS AN- ADVOCATE AND- YES SOME IS SUPPOSED TO THE IDEA ANYWAYS I'LL BE WATCHING VERY CLOSELY TO MAKE SURE. HOW THOSE NEGOTIATIONS GO AND- YOU KNOW WHAT THE FINAL IF IT DOES GET SOLD HOW THAT FINALLY COMES. TO BE SO THANK MITCHELL MARK FOR PUTTING THAT OUT. THIS BATES I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE COMMENT REGARDING LITIGATION SO THE LITIGATION DOESN'T GO AWAY EVEN IF THE STATE DIVEST ITSELF OF THE OWNERSHIP IS THAT CORRECT. ACTUALLY I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER THAT QUESTION HAT HAVE HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT I THINK IN TERMS OF THE FUTURE OF THE PROPERTY AND WHOMEVER WOULD ACQUIRE IT THROUGH A PURCHASE THE SECOND THING THAT TROUBLES ME OF COURSE IS THE PROCESS WHICH WAS BROUGHT OUT BECAUSE IT HASN'T ALLOWED THOSE WHO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH. THE MANNER IN WHICH IS GOING FORWARD I TO HAVE THEIR SAY SO I JUST WANT TO PUT THAT ON THE RECORD AND FINALLY ON IN OUR ANALYSIS THERE IS A CONCERN ABOUT THEM HAVING THERE'S NO REVERSION CLAUSE WHICH MEANS THAT IF IT WASN'T SOLD DATA IF IT WAS SOLD THAT THERE WOULD BE A PROHIBITION. OF FOR IT BEING SOLD FROM THAT SECOND. JUST SIR TO A SECOND PURCHASER. WHO COULD THEN USE THAT FOR YOU KNOW PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT AND IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE. YOU YOU ADDRESS THAT KIND OF BY SAYING IT SO RURAL THAT WOULD BE A VERY. FAR STRETCH. THIS IS GOING TO COME OUT THERE AND YOU KNOW BUILDING. FOUR HUNDRED UNIT. AFFORDABLE HOUSING ANYWAY. BUT TO THOSE ARE CONCERNS OF MINE SO I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT TODAY BUT I CERTAINLY I. WILL WATCH IT CLOSELY GOING FORWARD BECAUSE I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE. CONSERVATION LANDS ON THERE ARE PARTNERED WITH THOSE THAT ARE VERY ACTIVE. BY THE WAY WE HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION AND MY DISTRICT. IN THE SOUTHERLY PART OF IT WHERE WE HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME THING AND CONSERVATION. A LARGE PIECE OF PROPERTY THAT WAS CONSERVE. OUR FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PURPOSES MITIGATION PURPOSES AND ALSO PARTNERED WITH. AN AREA THAT IS FOR OFF ROADING AND WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THERE'S BEEN A DEGRADATION. OF THE CONSERVATION PART BUT THERE'S ALSO BEEN A ARE TRICKS AND- ON THE PROMISES THAT WERE MADE ON TO THOSE TWO. SO IT'S NOT AN EASY IS NOT AN EASY PARTNERSHIP. SO A LOT OF THOUGHT HAS TO GO INTO THE WAY IT'S DONE. SO WITHOUT. THANK YOU FOR YOU KNOW COMING IN. I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY BUT AGAIN I WILL BE WATCHING GOING FORWARD MISTER JOHNS AS A FOLLOW UP YES I DO THINK MISTER CHAIRMAN I THINK MISTER WHITE CASKEY AND MS BATES HAVE DUG INTO A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. ON THIS PARTICULAR MATTER ESPECIALLY WITH THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I WOULD AND IT'S IT SEEMS LIKE TO ME I'M GETTING FROM DEPARTMENT FINANCE THAT THEY WANT TO GET. TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS AND GIVE US THIS INFORMATION. I'M WONDERING IF IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR THE MOTION MAKER TO WITHDRAW AS MOTION TODAY AND WE HOLD THE BILL HERE THERE'S NO CRISIS THE- AND THERE'S NO IMPENDING EMERGENCY ON THIS WE CAN WORK ON THIS OVER THE TERM. AND MAYBE EVEN SOME OF US THERE AND DO SOME. VISITS OF THE OF THE PROPERTY AND CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WHICH I THINK WOULD LEAD TO A MORE POSITIVE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE PROPONENTS AND OPPONENTS OF THIS PARTICULAR. TOPIC. I'M I'M NOT CARE WITHDRAW MY MOTION. ALTHOUGH I THINK THE YOUR COMMENTS WOULD GO TO THE ACTUAL COSTS BECAUSE OF FINANCE WOULD GIVE AGAIN MORE ONLY AUTHORIZING DSG SO THERE'D FINANCES GET A FOLLOW UP THEY'RE GOING TO GET. THIS IN FOR THIS INFORMATION AND THAT MAY AFFECT. A DEAL POINT I'M SO I WILL NOT WITHDRAW MY MOTION MISTER CHAIR OKAY NOW I WOULD JUST COMMENT THAT. WE'RE NOT MANDATING ANYTHING OTHER THAN ALLOWING A CONVERSATION TO CONTINUE. AND SO I THINK GIVEN THAT FACT THAT THIS IS JUST. FRANKLY AUTHORIZING PEOPLE O TALK. I DON'T SEE THE NEED TO HOLD COMMITTEE BECAUSE- WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OUTCOME OF THAT CONVERSATION THAT DISUSSION. THE PRICES SAID AS A MINIMUM NOT A MAXIMUM. TGS STILL WILL APPROVE ANYTHING THAT. WOULD WOULD BE FORTHCOMING. SO I'M DOUBLE PUTTING THE PEOPLE OUT BECAUSE I THINK IT JUST ENCOURAGES A CUT ALL THE RIGHT IS A CUT. IN LIKE POST. THAT THAT WE APPROVED A FEW YEARS AGO I WAS PART OF THAT CONVERSATION THERE'S NO CONFLICTS WITH. THIS AUTHORIZATION THAT'S PROVIDED HERE THEY REASON THE BILLS HERE IS BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT SAYS THEY DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORIZATION SO. IT RESOLVES THAT THIRTY. SECONDLY FOR THE OFF ROAD ENTHUSIASTS AND WE HAVE MANY IN OUR DISTRICTS THAT ENJOY THAT ACTIVITY THERE'S A PARK RIGHT THERE NEXT DOOR THAT THEY PARTICIPATE IN AT. AND THAT NOTHING IN THIS BILL OR ANY. POTENTIAL SALE OF THE PROPERTY WOULD AFFECT. THE ABILITY FOR THOSE WHO ENJOY THAT ACTIVITY TO DO SO. IT'S ONE OF EIGHT PARKS IN THE STATE AND WE'RE PROUD TO HAVE IT HERE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A LITTLE MORE RESPONSIBLE USE PERHAPS BUT- IT'S CURRENTLY. USED ALTHOUGH THERE IS DECLINING DISSIPATION ACCORDING TO SIX. AND FINALLY THE CONTROLLING ELEMENT HERE IS THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RACK WITH ADVICE FROM THE COMMISSION OFF HIGHWAY. VEHICLE COMMISSIONERS. IN TWO YES THE SPORT INVOLVES AND ALL THAT GOES ON. WITH THAT ACTIVITY STATE SIR ON THIS PROPERTY AND THE PROPOSAL TO EXPAND PROPER. AND SO THEY CONTINUE TO BE AN TROLL SIMPLY DEALS WITH THE BLIND SPOT THAT THE DEPARTMENT THEMSELVES OF RECOGNIZE THAT THIS LITIGATION GONE ON AND ON FOR YEARS AND YEARS. THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF BEING SPENT ON SPECIAL. IN A SITUATION WHERE. WE THINK THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS THAT THEY SHOULD THAT BE A AVAIL TO IF THEY DECIDE IT'S APPROPRIATE AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM. WITH THAT APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT TODAY. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR ABBOTT ON FOR WITH THAT WILL TAKE THE ROLE. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE SENATE FLOOR PORTANTINO HI PORTANTINO I'D BATES. BRADFORD.

US WITH CHAPTER SEVEN POINT THREE OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY. WHICH ONLY APPLIES TO CERTIFICATION OF PROGRAMS RATHER THAN LICENSING AND AS SUCH IT IS UNCLEAR APARTMENT ACTIVITIES CAN BE SUPPORTED BY FEES AND ABSENT THIS HE REVENUE COSTS WOULD BE BORNE BY THE GENERAL FUND.
