FIRST OKAY THEN I GUESS ONE OF

00:16:51.443 --> 00:16:53.045
QUESTION IN TERMS OF AGAIN AND

00:16:53.112 --> 00:17:00.085
NOW I'VE IT. BUT WE DESIGNED

00:17:00.152 --> 00:17:01.086
THE SYSTEM IN A WAY THAT. FOR

00:17:01.153 --> 00:17:01.787
LET'S SAY FIVE OR YEARS FROM

00:17:01.854 --> 00:17:05.357

00:17:05.424 --> 00:17:06.191
ISN'T THE PARTNER WANT TO USE

00:17:06.258 --> 00:17:07.526
WE WATCH FOR. THAT WE'RE GONNA

00:17:07.593 --> 00:17:08.794
BE ABLE TO DO THAT OR- SIGN IN

00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:10.796
A WAY THAT SORT OF LOCKS US. A

00:17:10.863 --> 00:17:13.532
WHERE- YOU KNOW THAT'S THE POOL.

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:16.135
WE HAVE TO USE. THE GOAL IS TO

00:17:16.201 --> 00:17:18.370
HAVE OUR BUSINESS RULES AND OUR

00:17:18.437 --> 00:17:20.572
DATA- AND EIGHT WHAT'S CALLED A

00:17:20.639 --> 00:17:21.306
DATA INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

00:17:21.373 --> 00:17:23.342
SEPARATE APART FROM SALES FORCE

00:17:23.409 --> 00:17:25.344
TO ALLOW THE STATE TO HAVE THE

00:17:25.411 --> 00:17:27.112
FLEXIBILITY IN THE FUTURE WE

00:17:27.179 --> 00:17:28.447
HAVE THE OWNERSHIP OF THAT CORE

00:17:28.514 --> 00:17:30.249
INFORMATION AND SO IN THE

00:17:30.315 --> 00:17:31.617
FUTURE SHOULD WE WANT TO CHANGE

00:17:31.683 --> 00:17:35.821
PLATFORMS OR DO SOMETHING

00:17:35.888 --> 00:17:36.355
DIFFERENT. WE WOULD NOT BE

LOCKED IN. OKAY THAT'S GOING TO

00:17:38.424 --> 00:17:39.391
BE I MEAN I THINK THAT'S

00:17:39.458 --> 00:17:41.260
IMPORTANT THAT WE OWN THE DATA

00:17:41.326 --> 00:17:43.095
THAT WE CONTROL THE DATA THAT

00:17:43.162 --> 00:17:44.496
WE'RE NOT IN THAT SITUATION

00:17:44.563 --> 00:17:45.631
WHERE WE'RE LOCKED INTO A

00:17:45.697 --> 00:17:46.999

BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS BUT

00:18:06.785 --> 00:18:08.554

CONTINUOUS OVERSIGHT OF THIS

00:18:09.888 --> 00:18:11.123
PROJECT THROUGH THE MONTHLY

PROJECT COST COULD CHANGE

00:18:27.873 --> 00:18:28.740
HOWEVER AS THERE ARE SEVERAL

00:18:28.807 --> 00:18:30.008
PROCUREMENTS THAT ARE STILL

00:18:30.075 --> 00:18:32.611
UNDER WAY AND CDC IS REQUIRING

00:18:32.678 --> 00:18:34.413

PROJECT IN THE BUDGET YEAR TO

00:18:44.156 --> 00:18:46.125
TEST WHETHER THIS NEW APPROACH

00:18:46.191 --> 00:18:46.725
THAT'S ALREADY BEEN DESCRIBED

00:18:46.792 --> 00:18:48.994
AS WORKING AND TO ESTABLISH KEY

00:18:49.061 --> 00:18:50.762
PERFORMANCE INDICATORS TO SHOW

00:18:50.829 --> 00:18:52.664
WITH DATA WHETHER NEW SYSTEM

00:18:52.731 --> 00:18:54.933
FUNCTIONALITIES ARE IMPROVING-

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.568
THE SYSTEM THE STATE'S-

BUSINESS PROCESS SEES AND SO

00:18:58.303 --> 00:18:59.338
OVERSIGHT OF THE DEVELOPMENT

HAVE A STEP YET MUCH WEEK THOSE

00:19:17.122 --> 00:19:19.057
A- THAT WE BE ABLE TO CHECK THE-

00:19:19.124 --> 00:19:21.059

WILL BE ADDITIONAL TIME TO

00:19:32.037 --> 00:19:33.872
DISCUSS THIS ISSUE BECAUSE-

00:19:33.939 --> 00:19:35.374

THE PROPOSAL YOU'LL SEE THE-

00:19:37.576 --> 00:19:38.677

00:19:59.464 --> 00:20:01.300
BY I THINK AT LEAST FOR US IS

00:20:01.366 --> 00:20:03.535
LEGISLATORS- WE PROBABLY SHOULD

00:20:03.602 --> 00:20:06.338

00:20:07.439 --> 00:20:09.174
WITHIN THE BUDGETS OF THREE

00:20:09.241 --> 00:20:10.375
FIVE ELECTED TO SPEND A LITTLE

THE PRICE OF THE PROJECT HAS

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:20.252
GONE UP FOR. CLOSING IN ON A

00:20:20.319 --> 00:20:22.287
BILLION- SELLER NINE HUNDRED

00:20:22.354 --> 00:20:23.789
ELEVEN MILLION- AND I THINK

00:20:23.855 --> 00:20:24.590
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO

00:20:24.656 --> 00:20:27.559
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S- GOING ON HI.

00:20:27.626 --> 00:20:28.460
AND THEN I GUESS THE OTHER

00:20:28.527 --> 00:20:30.329
THING I ALSO WOULD JUST WANNA

00:20:30.395 --> 00:20:31.763
PUT A PEN ON IS THAT AND I'VE

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:32.898
ASKED THIS QUESTION USUALLY

00:20:32.965 --> 00:20:34.733

AND IT PROJECTS SHOULD ALSO

00:20:38.804 --> 00:20:42.207
IMPROVE OUR EFFICIENCY. SO SO

00:20:42.274 --> 00:20:42.941
OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GOING TO BE

00:20:43.008 --> 00:20:45.110
INVESTING- THAT THIS POINT OVER

00:20:45.177 --> 00:20:46.111
NINE HUNDRED MILLION IN THIS

00:20:46.178 --> 00:20:48.981

00:35:33.431 --> 00:35:35.666
FALLING DOWN AROUND RESIDENTS

00:35:35.733 --> 00:35:37.568
BECAUSE THERE'S JUST NO EXTRA

00:35:37.635 --> 00:35:40.872
MONEY TO FIX THE ROOF. TO FIX A

00:35:54.752 --> 00:35:56.854
DOLLAR A DAY INVESTMENT. WHICH

00:35:56.921 --> 00:35:59.090
ALMOST DOUBLES THE DAILY RATE

00:35:59.156 --> 00:36:00.491
AND ALLOWS THESE BUSINESS

00:36:00.558 --> 00:36:04.495
OWNERS THAT ARE SO DEDICATED.

00:36:04.562 --> 00:36:05.263

00:36:14.238 --> 00:36:15.907
ACTIVITIES FOR THESE RESIDENTS

00:36:15.973 --> 00:36:17.875
BUT THEY'RE NOT MAGICIANS AND

00:36:17.942 --> 00:36:19.744
THEY CANNOT FIND IT EMPTY BED

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:21.312
WHEN ONE OF THESE FACILITIES

00:36:21.379 --> 00:36:23.114
THAT PROVIDES FOR THIS LOWEST

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:24.515
OF THE LOW INCOME WHEN THOSE

00:36:24.582 --> 00:36:27.184
FACILITIES BECAUSE- THOMPSON'S

00:36:27.251 --> 00:36:28.686
DESK. BECAUSE THEY SAID THEY

00:36:28.753 --> 00:36:30.588
DON'T HAVE MAGIC WANDS SO WHAT

00:36:30.655 --> 00:36:32.056
HAPPENS IS THESE RESIDENTS MOVE

00:36:32.123 --> 00:36:35.026
AWAY FROM THE FAMILIES AND

00:36:35.092 --> 00:36:37.228

01:24:11.813 --> 01:24:13.348
HOUSING STABILITY OF MANY

01:24:13.415 --> 01:24:15.917

SERVED THROUGH THIS PROGRAM. I

01:24:22.991 --> 01:24:25.260
DURING DURING. AND ALSO. HE

01:24:25.326 --> 01:24:26.361
THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DO HAVE

ACTUALLY STARTED AGAIN WITH THE

01:24:31.566 --> 01:24:33.802
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE-

01:24:33.868 --> 01:24:35.136
WE DON'T HAVE ANY PARTICULAR

01:24:35.203 --> 01:24:36.805
CONCERNS WITH THE REQUESTED

01:24:36.871 --> 01:24:38.840
STAFFING RESOURCES- BUT WE DO

01:24:38.907 --> 01:24:40.241

01:24:40.308 --> 01:24:42.777
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE- COMMUNITY

01:24:42.844 --> 01:24:44.279
CARE EXPANSION PROGRAM

01:24:44.345 --> 01:24:47.348
PROPOSAL. IN PARTICULAR-

01:24:47.415 --> 01:24:49.117
WITHOUT DETAILED IMPLEMENTING

01:24:49.184 --> 01:24:51.352
LEGISLATION FOR THE PROGRAM-

01:24:51.419 --> 01:24:53.188
EXACTLY HOW THE PROGRAM WOULD

01:24:53.254 --> 01:24:55.190
BE ADMINISTERED AND OVERSEEN

01:24:55.256 --> 01:24:57.158
REMAINS UNCLEAR AT THIS TIME.

01:24:57.225 --> 01:24:58.526
SO IT'S A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO

01:24:58.593 --> 01:24:59.761
ASSESS WHETHER IT'S THE

01:24:59.828 --> 01:25:02.363
REQUESTED RESOURCE SAYS- WHAT

01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:04.499
INDEED BE SUFFICIENT FOR THE

01:25:04.566 --> 01:25:05.900
PROGRAM HOWEVER WE'RE

01:25:05.967 --> 01:25:07.168
CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE

01:25:07.235 --> 01:25:08.970

01:25:09.037 --> 01:25:10.839
DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION PLANS

01:25:10.905 --> 01:25:12.974
AS THOSE ARE DEVELOPED. IN

01:25:13.041 --> 01:25:15.577

01:25:20.949 --> 01:25:22.417
THE LEGISLATURE IS ALSO

01:25:22.484 --> 01:25:24.185
CONSIDERING FUNDING FOR A PILOT

01:25:24.252 --> 01:25:25.920

THIS PROPOSED PROGRAM LIKELY

01:25:37.999 --> 01:25:39.901

01:25:41.836 --> 01:25:42.570
COMMUNITY CARE EXPANSION

01:25:42.637 --> 01:25:44.739
PROGRAM. SO DEPENDING ON

01:25:44.806 --> 01:25:46.608
WHETHER THE LEGISLATURE CHOOSES

01:25:46.674 --> 01:25:48.343
TO MOVE FORWARD- WITH ONE OR

01:25:48.409 --> 01:25:50.111
BOTH OF THESE PROGRAMS THERE

01:25:50.178 --> 01:25:52.447

01:36:42.897 --> 01:36:45.866
VERY DIFFERENT PURPOSE BUT-

WELFARE DIRECTOR- JUST AS A

01:37:01.649 --> 01:37:03.684
DISSOCIATION IN THE IN TERMS OF

01:37:03.751 --> 01:37:06.554
THE KIND OF. IT INFRASRUCTURE

01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:07.121
WE NEED TO HELP TRY TO TRACK

01:37:07.188 --> 01:37:12.226

01:37:12.293 --> 01:37:14.662
WE DON'T HAVE ANY KIND OF A- A

01:37:14.728 --> 01:37:16.096
CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR

01:37:16.163 --> 01:37:19.099
EXAMPLE LIKE WE DO IN ORANGE

01:37:19.166 --> 01:37:20.534
