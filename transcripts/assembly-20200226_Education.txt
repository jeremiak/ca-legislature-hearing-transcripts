ASSESSMENT SYSTEM. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAS A SEAT ON THE SMARTER BALANCED EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE I JUST TOOK THAT ROLE. AS OF JANUARY. OF TWENTY TWENTY. AND WE OVERSEE THE BALLOT BUDGET SOME POLICIES OF THE CONSORTIUM THE CONSORTIUM IN CONSULTATION WITH OTHER STATE MEMBERS. SOME HAND THIS OVER TO OUR BANK IS GOING TO GET INTO A LITTLE BIT DEEPER. THANKS TOTALLY YEAH. GOOD AFTERNOON CHIU AND MEMBERS THE SOME AT COMMITTEE MY NAME TONY I'LL AND EGGS TO OF THIS ABOUT ASSESSMENT CAN. CORNERSTONE OF THE SMARTER BALANCED MISSION IS TO PROVIDE RESOURCES TO TEACHERS THAT HELP TEACHERS HELP THEIR STUDENTS LEARN MORE AS IT IS EDUCATORS WHO KNOW THEIR NEEDS BEST SMART ABOUT SAYS BROUGHT TOGETHER HUNDREDS OF EDUCATORS TO DESIGN AND BUILD AN ARRAY OF RESOURCES INCLUDING SOMEBODY OF INTERIM TESTING RESOURCES THAT SUPPORT THE FORMATIVE PROCESS FROM THE BEGINNING CALIFORNIA EDUCATE EDUCATORS HAVE CONTRIBUTED IMMENSELY TO BUILDING THIS ASSESSMENT SYSTEM THE INSTRUCTIONAL RESOURCES PROVIDED BY SPIDER BOUNCE AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ARE FREE TO TEACHERS IN CALIFORNIA. AND OUR LINE TO THE ACADEMIC STANDARDS I WILL HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THOSE RESOURCES NOW TOOLS FOR TEACHERS IS A NEW WEBSITE COMING IN JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY DESIGNED WITH SIGNIFICANT INPUT BY EDUCATORS. BASED ON FEEDBACK REGARDING THE DIGITAL LIBRARY AND THROUGH WORKSHOPS AND FOCUS% GROUPS ABOUT TOOLS FOR TEACHERS. TOOLS FOR TEACHERS IS DESIGNED TO HELP SAVE TEACHERS TIME BY PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY INSTRUCTIONAL RESOURCES AND ACTIVITIES TO HELP THEM IMPROVE STUDENT LEARNING LEARNING ALL THE RESOURCES AND TOOLS FOR TEACHERS ARE CREATED AND APPROVED BY EDUCATORS. AND TOOLS FOR TEACHERS WILL REPLACE THE CURRENT DIGITAL LIBRARY. A FEW OF THE KEY FEATURES FOR TOOL FOR TEACHERS INCLUDE IMPROVED CONNECTIONS PLAYLIST THAT GUY TEACHERS REGARDING THE NEXT STEPS THEY MAY CONSIDER BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE INTERIM. AND FOCUSED INTERIM ASSESSMENTS IMPROVED FORMATIVE RESOURCES THAT ARE ACCESSIBLE DYNAMIC IN EASY TO READ AND A SEARCH FEATURE THAT IS DESIGNED TO HELP TEACHERS QUICKLY FIND THE RESOURCES THEY NEED. IN JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY EDUCATORS WILL HAVE EARLY ACCESS TO THE SITE IN TIME FOR SUMMER TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES AND THE GRAND OPENING WILL BE IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY. SMART AMOUNTS INTERIM SEVEN IT'S IN OUR SUSSMAN. TEACHERS BY THEM PERIODICALLY CHECK WITH STUDENTS KNOW WE CAN DO. EARLY FEEDBACK FROM T. WAS A OUR OLD ENORMOUS EXPENSE YOU CHEN. AND THEN FOLLOW TWO THOUSAND. WERE RELEASED THE FIRST WAVE OF FOCUS ENORMOUS ASMAN BLOCKS WHICH PROVIDE EDUCATORS WITH MORE FIND GREAT INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR STUDENTS. EACH YEAR MORE TEACHERS IN CALIFORNIA USE THE INNERMOST ASPIN'S LAST YEAR CALIFORNIA ADMINISTERED MORE THAN ELEVEN MILLION ENORMOUS ASPENS AND THAT NUMBER IS ON TRACK TO INCREASE THIS YEAR. EACH ENORMOUS SUSSMAN BLOCK HAS A CONNECTIONS PLAY LESS THAT PROVIDES EDUCATORS WITH SUGGESTIONS REGARDING NEXT STEPS THAT THEY MAY WANT TO TAKE. BASED ON THEIR STRANGE PERFORMANCE AND AS I DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY THOSE CONNECTIONS ARE CREATED BY THEIR PEERS. BY LATE SPRING WE PLAN TO RELEASE THE ENHANCEMENT FOR TEACHERS TO PRINT ENORMOUS SAUCEPAN ITEMS AND THAT'S IN LARGE PART- PER THE REQUESTED SUGGESTION. OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL. CURRENTLY THERE ARE OVER A HUNDRED INTERNET SUSSMAN'S AVAILABLE WITH ALMOST FIFTY MORE ON THE WAY. OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. WE ALSO ARE- HAVE RECENTLY RELEASED THE SMARTER CONTENT EXPLORE- THAT WILL- WAS RELEASED IN FALL OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN- WHICH HELPS TEACHERS LEARN HOW TEST QUESTIONS ARE DESIGNED AND SCORE TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF WHAT STUDENTS KNOW WE CAN DO. TEACHERS CAN USE THE WEBSITE TO SUPPORT THEIR INSTRUCTION PLAN ACTIVITIES AND UNDERSTAND HOW SMART ABOUNDS CLAIMS AND TARGETS A LINE TO THEIR CONTENT STANDARDS WITH THE SMARTER BOUNCE COTTON EXPLORED TEACHERS CAN LEARN ABOUT TEST DEVELOPMENT WITH RESOURCES LIKE CONSTRUCT RELEVENT VOCABULARY BLUEPRINTS AND SCORING RUBRICS. THE CONTENT EXPLORE WILL BE ENHANCED IN MARCH- TO INCLUDE A DECRIPTION OF THE PROGRESSION OF KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS FOR EACH AND EVERY TARGET. THAT HELPS. EDUCATORS BETTER SCAFFOLD RESOURCES FOR STUDENTS TO HELP THEM REACH PROFICIENCY. WHAT ONE OF THE CORE MISS OF SPY BOUNCE TO MAKE THE ASSESSED ACCESSIBLE FOR ALL STUDENTS IN SPARTA BOUNCE IS AN INDUSTRY LEADER AND ACCESSIBILITY RESOURCES. SMARTER BALANCED PROVIDES UNMATCHED ACCESSIBILITY FEATURES SUCH AS BRAILLE SPANISH TRANSLATIONS AND GLOSSARIES IN MORE THAN TEN LANGUAGES AS WELL AS TRANSLATED TEST CORRECTIONS IN NINETEEN LANGUAGE LET NINETEEN LANGUAGES. THIS YEAR WE ADDED PERMISO SMALLEY TOWARD LANGUAGE CLASS RACE. THIS YEAR WE ALSO ADDED AN ILLUSTRATION GLOSSARY IN MATHEMATICS WHICH HELP STUDENTS UNDERSTAND WORDS OR PHRASES IN TEST QUESTIONS WHEN THEY MAY NOT OTHERWISE BENEFIT FROM TAX PLATE BASE GLOSSARIES OR AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE VIDEOS. BY USING PICTURES WHICH IS- NO ONE ELSE IS DOING THIS WORK- AND WE'RE GETTING REALLY POSITIVE FEEDBACK ABOUT THAT. SMART BOUNCE WORK WITH ANY. STUDENTS AND EXPERTS IN THE FIELD DESIGN AND TEST THE ASSESSMENT SYSTEM WE WORK WITH ADVISORY PANELS ON ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES TO ENSURE THAT ASSESSMENTS ARE DEVELOPED WITH- PRINCIPLES OF UNIVERSES. UNIVERSALISM AND RESEARCH BASED BEST PRACTICES WE'VE COLLABORATED WITH EDUCATORS TO DEVELOP INSTRUCTIONAL ACCESSIBILITY STRATEGIES THAT HELP EDUCATORS CONNECT CLASSROOM USE OF ACCESSIBILITY PRACTICES TO ACCESSIBILITY RESOURCES OFFERED ON THE AN ARM AND SOMEBODY'S ASSESSMENTS. AND THEN I WILL ASK MOUTH SAYING- TO CONTINUE. YES GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL AND MEMBERS OF THIS AND THE EDUCATION. MY NAME MELVIN AS MEN I AM THE DOOR FOR THE DEVELOP AND MYSTERY TO AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. AND I WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE NEWLY RELEASED SAMPLE ITEMS. SO BY WORKING WITH EDUCATORS FOR THE LAST MONTH- MULTIPLE YEARS THE CONSORTIUM HAS CREATED- QUESTION BANK THAT IS LARGE ENOUGH AT THIS TIME THEY WERE ABLE TO RELEASE- TEST MORE TEST QUESTIONS. AND WE JUST RELEASED A HUNDRED FOR SAMPLE TEST QUESTIONS FROM THE SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENTS- IN MATH AND THE LA AND ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS IN THE LAST OF. IT EARLIER THIS MONTH ACTUALLY. AN ENGINE TO USE THESE NEW SAMPLE ITEM OR CLICK TEST CA. PRETTY MUCH TO UNDERSTAND HOW SMARTER BALANCED MEASURES COLLEGE AND CAREER READY CONTENT. IT ALSO TO LEARN HOW ITEMS AND TASKS ARE SCORED. AND THEN TO INTERACT WITH THE FULL RANGE OF QUESTION TYPES AND ACCESSIBILITY RESOURCES THAT TONY MENTIONED KINDA LIKE SEE WHAT ALL THOSE ACCESSIBILITY RESOURCES LOOK LIKE IN THE SYSTEM. AND THEN ANOTHER ADDITION TO THE SAMPLE ITEMS- WEBSITE IS STUDENT WRITING SAMPLES FOR PERFORMANCE TASKS AND THOSE ARE- REALLY SAMPLES THAT INCLUDE EXPLANATIONS TO HELP. TEACHERS BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW THE PAPERS WERE SCORED SO IT'S REALLY LIKE A PROFESSIONAL LEARNING OPPORTUNITY AS WELL. THE BASE IMPART AGAIN ON ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL'S TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN LEGISLATION WE BEGAN A SERIES OF ENHANCEMENTS TO THE SAMPLE ITEMS WEBSITE- INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO PRINT THE QUESTIONS SO THAT A TEACHERS MAY USE THE SAMPLE ITEMS AS PART OF THEIR FORMATIVE PROCESS- AND THIS YEAR OR IF THEY LATE MAY EDUCATE. WILL BE ABLETO FIND ITEMS BY CONTENT STANDARDS ON THE SAMPLE- ITEMS WEBSITE. SO TO SHARE ANOTHER SYSTEM THAT WE ARE A BILL IN AND IT'S BECAUSE FOR U IT'S THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATOR REPORTING SYSTEM THIS IS AN INTER ACTIVE ON MY REPORTING WEBSITE. THAT ALLOWS TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS TO- ACT ACCESS DETAILS STUDENT PERFORMANCE INFORMATION. AND THAT MEANS THAT THE USERS OF THE SYSTEMS CAN VIEW THE-STUDENT DATA BY DISTRICT BY SCHOOL AND BY- GRADE LEVEL AND THEY MAY ALSO VIEW DOWNLOAD THE RESULTS AND- INDIVIDUAL STUDENT REPORTS FOR THE STUDENTS. THE SYSTEM WAS OVER HALL BASED ON ADVICE FROM THAT CALIFORNIA'S EDUCATORS- MAINLY AND THAT INCLUDES THAT THEY WANTED TO HAVE A SUMMARY OF PERFORMANCE FOR TESTS OF A TEACHER'S CLASS SO TEACHER GIVES A NUMBER OF TESTS AND- TO BE ABLE TO GET A SUMMARY OF HOW THE STUDENTS PUT. QUICKLY IT DRAWS TO SCORE REPORTS AS I'M IT LINKS TO IN. RESOURCES AFTER THE STUDENTS GET A CERTAIN. LEVEL WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THEM WHAT KIND OF RESOURCES CAN YOU DO HOW CAN YOU LIKE CHALLENGE THEIR LEARNING A LITTLE BIT MORE. ALSO IN FOR UP THE- THAT THE STUDENTS RESPONDING TO. SPOT RESPONDED TO INCLUDING LIKE THE CONTENTS DANDER IN MEASURES AND ACCESS TO THE STUDENT RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONS AND THE ABILITY TO LOOK AT THE INCORRECT ANSWERS THAT ARE MOST COMMONLY. OF THAT SELECTED BY THE STUDENTS SO THAT YOU COULD FOCUS ON TEACHING OR RE TEACHING. IF I WOULD NUMBER STUDENTS GOT IT WRONG BUT LONG ANSWER ONE QUESTION WRONG YOU SHOULD PROBABLY LOOK AT MAYBE WE NEED TO REACH SOMETHING. SO PRETTY MUCH O DURING THE NEXT TWO YEARS STUDENT RESULTS FROM ALL CAST. ASSESSMENTS WILL BE ADDED TO THE CALIFORNIA REPORTING SYSTEM. PROVIDING OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS A SINGLE PLATFORM TO ASK ACCESS ALL OF OUR CAST AND OTHER ASSESSMENTS RESULTS IN ONE SINGLE PLACE. THANK SO I'D LIKE TO CONCLUDE WITH SHARING A LITTLE BIT OF A AND TOTALSTORY THAT HAPPENED ABOUT FOUR WEEKS AGO I WAS ASKED TO COME IN SUPPORT OF SCHOOL DISTRICT BECAUSE I WAS A FORMER PRINCIPAL THERE AND THE NEW MY ROLE IN NEW WITH ACCESS I HAD TO. RESOURCES AND SUPPORTS ANDTHEY WERE INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT HOW THEY COULD TAKE THE REPORTS COMING FROM THE EDUCATOR PORTING SYSTEM AND REALLY UTILIZING THEM AS THE FOUNDATION FOR CONVERSATIONS AROUND PLANNING THEIR INSTRUCTION. AND PLANNING AND REALLY HELPING THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT PEDAGOGIES WOULD BE BEST PRACTICE FOR THE STUDENTS THAT THEY SERVED AND SO IT WAS A WHOLE STAFF MEETING THEY HAD PRINCIPLES FROM ALL THE OTHERS SCHOOLS JOIN US AND WE DIVED INTO HOW THEY COULD UTILIZE ALL THESE RESOURCES BECAUSE THEY WE UNDERSTAND THAT CURRICULUM INSTRUCTION AND ASSESSMENT ARE INTER DEPENDENT OF EACH OTHER. THE ASSESSMENT ELEMENTS THAT WE GET THE INFORMATION WE GET IS JUST ONE PIECE OF THE PUZZLE ABOUT HOW OUR STUDENTS ARE DOING. LOOKING AT STUDENT WORK. LOOKING AT THE FORMATIVE ASSESSMENTS LOOKING AT THE OTHER INFORMAL FORMATIVE ASSESSMENTS THAT ARE. TEACHERS CONDUCT ON A DAILY BASIS SOMETIMES. EVERY TEN MINUTES IN THE CLASSROOM HOPES THEM UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS. AND SO FROM THAT THEY FELT THAT THIS WAS EXTREMELY VALUABLE TO THEM AND FURTHER GUIDING THEIR INSTRUCTIONAL PRACTICES. AND BEING PRO ACTIVE TO MEETING THE NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS VERSUS BEING REACTIVE. AND SO THAT WAS VERY EXCITING TO BE A PART OF AND TO WATCH THOSE LIGHT BULBS GO OFF. WITH ALL OF THE TEACHERS AND PRINCIPALS THAT ARE SERVING OUR THE STUDENTS. SO OVERALL WE BELIEVE THAT A HIGH QUALITY ASSESSMENT SYSTEM SUCH A SMARTER BALANCED CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION AND TOOLS FOR TEACHERS TO IMPROVE INSTRUCTION. AND HELP STUDENTS SUCCEED REGARDLESS OF DISABILITY OR LANGUAGE NEEDS THE SMARTER BALANCED ASSESSMENT SYSTEM HAS BEEN BUILT WITH TEACHER INPUT FOR TEACHERS AND STUDENTS TO USE. TEACHERS CAN ACCESS RESOURCES INCLUDING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AS AN INSTRUCTIONAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THAT STUDENT LEARNING AS I'VE TALKED ABOUT. AND THEY CAN ALSO USE OPTIONAL FLEXIBLE INTERIM ASSESSMENTS AND SUCH AS THE INTERIM ASSESSMENT BLOCKS THAT ARE FOCUSED IN ON A DISCREET SKILL THAT THEY MADE ME MORE INFORMATION ABOUT FOR THEIR STUDENTS. AND THE STUDENTS CAN PARTICIPATE IN THE SUMMIT AT THE END OF THE YEAR TASK THE ONES THAT YOU WERE SPEAKING TO. AND IN ORDER TO MEASURE THAT ACHIEVEMENT GROW. AND IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS AND MATH AND NOW WE HAVE OUR SCIENCE ASSESSMENT THE ONLINE FORMAT IS WHAT OUR STUDENTS KNOW IT'S WHAT THEY WERE BORN INTO RIGHT THEY ARE. ARE DIGITAL NATIVES WE ARE MORE OF THE DIGITAL IMMIGRANTS AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT IT HELPS THEM UNDERSTAND HOW TO UTILIZE TECHNOLOGY AND THEIR PROBLEM SOLVING AND CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS. AND THAT THEY WILL NEED TO. NOW AND BEYOND. THE THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS ARE JUST A COUPLE QUESTIONS AND I'LL SEE IF ANY OF THE OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE ANY THOUGHTS OR OR QUESTIONS- AND THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOU'RE REFERENCING MY EFFORTS TO KINDA. YOU KNOW MOVE US ON. YOU KNOW CAN REBOOT THE TAP ALL WRITTEN SOME WAY AND BILL I PAY SUCCESS. BUT I'LL BE HONEST YOU YOU SHOULDN'T BE RESPONDING TO ME SHOULD REALLY BE SPOT RESPOND TO THE CLASSROOM. THE NEED TO THE TEACHERS AND ULTIMATELY STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA SO. HOW DOES THE CONSORTIUM HOW DO THEY CONNECT THE CLASSROOM HOW DO THEY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. IN THE CLASSROOM IS THERE TO HAVE A FORMAL PROCESS FOR THAT. I MEAN IT'S GREAT THAT YOU KNOW THIS TEST WAS PUT TOGETHER THE TEACHER STARTED GIVING IN IN THE PLATFORMS ARE RATHER CONFUSING I TOOK THE FOURTH RADIO A TEST. THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS PORTION WASN'T DIFFICULT BUT QUITE FRANKLY MATCH NAME THROUGH THE PROGRAM WAS A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT BUT I HAD A CENTER. THEN THAT'S JUST MORE OF A PROCESS ISSUE BUT HOW. YOU HEARING FROM THE- ON AND WHAT NEEDS TO BE WOULD DONE WHAT TOOLS. NEED NEW TEACHERS NEED TO BE MORE SUCCESSFUL. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER O'DONNELL BUT IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION SO- THERE ARE A COUPLE OF VENUES FOR THAT- WITH THE FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT IS THAT- WE RECEIVE THE FEEDBACK FROM THE MEMBER STATE THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SO- THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAS. MULTIPLE MEETINGS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR WHERE THEY RECEIVE FEEDBACK DIRECTLY FROM THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS RECEIVE IT FROM THE TEACHER'S SO THERE'S- INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR IN WHICH THAT. FEEDBACK IS BEING PROVIDED UP FROM THE FROM THE TEACHERS THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND THEN- THOSE- DEPARTMENTS OF EDUCATION BRING THOSE ENHANCEMENTS ENHANCEMENT REQUESTS- IN THE FORM OF PROPOSALS- AND- PROGRAM CHANGES AND- AND BUDGET SUGGESTIONS TO THE CONSORTIUM- AND THAT ALL GETS WRAPPED UP IN THE ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS THAT WE ENGAGE AND DISCUSSIONS THAT WE HAVE AS AT OUR MADE COLLABORATION CONFERENCE. WE ALSO HAVE- SOMETHING THAT'S THE PERFORMANCE AND PRACTICES COMMITTEE OF WHICH THERE ARE- SEVERAL CALIFORNIANS ON OF FOUR OF WHICH WE- IN DEEP LEARNING- WITH WITH THOSE FOLKS. IN WHICH THEY LEARN ABOUT THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THE ASSESSMENT SYSTEM- WE PARTICIPATE IN DESIGN AND DISCUSSIONS WITH A MASK THEM UP THEIR ECONOMIC OF. THIS APPROACH THIS APPROACH AND GET THEIR IF YOU. AS WE THEN PER. SOLUTIONS TO THE- THAT WE'RE THAT HEARING ABOUT THE WORK THAT WE'RE HERE ABOUT AND. AND HE- NO I THAT HAVE OUR THIS ADVOCATES GROUPS THAT ALSO TOOK INFORMATION FROM EDGE SO THERE THREE DIFFERENT THAN WHERE WE CAN THAT IN. SO THAT'S A LOT RIGHT THERE SO CAL A THAT THE FROM WE HAVE THE FOR THE LARGEST OF THE CONSOLE AT HOW HOW DOES THE VOTING I MEAN MY MIGHT WHAT I'M SEEING RIGHT ARE YOU JUST DESCRIBED ME POLITBURO IS JUST SOUNDS ME LIKE A GONNA TAKE FOR TO GET ANYTHING DONE INSIDE THE CONSORTIUM IN OF ALL FOR CALIBER THE LAW MEMBER OF THE CONSUMER WHO DO YOU GO GRAYSON YOU THE PER THAT WROTE COUNT. AND HOW THE SECOND COMMITTEE THEN START I ONCE WE SO HAVE TO VOTE SO OF ELEVEN. NO THAT'S NOT HOW THIS IS SET. FROM I AND I LEARNING ATHIS IS THE- SO WE THE EXACT. COMMITTEE THAT HAD. HOW MANY STATE TO REPRESENT ON THE EXACT COMMITTEE. ON THE- COMMITTEE THERE ARE. THIRTY TWO K. ARE THE EXACT COMMITTEE WE IS OUT AT REP. HIGHER IN. HIGHER NAY. DOES CSU AS A RED. OF OKAY SO HI HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE THE EXACT COMMITTEE. THERE ARE CURRENTLY CSUS HEATS LOTS OF IS ON FILLED WITH HAVE WE HAVE TO OF A- SO WE A- OKAY WE DON'T HAVE THEM REP GIVEN THE OF WE HAVE ONE COULD ARE. SO YEAH THAT IS ACCURATE OKAY THANK YOU AND I LISTEN I WEREN'T COVERS ALL. TO BE A STRONGER VOICE IN THAT BECAUSE I THINK WE TO MAKE CHANGE. OKAY CHANGES TO SERVE NEEDS FOR. TO THE CAN BE SUCCESSFUL THE CLASSROOM. YEAH WE'RE HERE SOME. FROM THE GROUND AND THE NEXT I DON'T KNOW HERE TO BE AS MUCH AS I READ THINK YOU NEED TO ENGAGED AND I AND YOU DON'T TO WAIT FOR A FROM MODOC. OKAY QUE HOLDEN JUST OUT OF THE OTHER I DON'T I TAKE ALL AFTERNOON HERE. OKAY SO I HAVE YOU ADDRESSING THE DIGITAL LIBRARY I MEAN I THINK YOU KNOW. JUST TO HELP ME DELIVER MY LESSONS SO I HOPE YOU'RE THINKING IN THAT. MANNER NOT JUST. RUNNING AND I AND WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE. YOU KNOW. I'VE I'VE HAD A LOT OF FOLKS FROM INDUSTRY SAY HEY LOOK AT ALL THESE LESSONS BY THE READY THE ITEM THE LESSON PLANS. WHAT I YOU KNOW THAT'S THE ART OF TEACHING I DEVELOP MY LESSON PLANS TO MEET MY NEEDS TO THE STATE HOW WE COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER. BUT I NEED RESOURCES. AND THAT'S WHY I'M GONNA JUMP TO THE FORMATIVE QUESTION. YEAH I HEARD YOU TALK ABOUT INTERIM BUT- IF WE LOOK AT THE ORIGINAL CODE SECTION AS ORIGINALLY CONTEMPLATED THE ASPECTS SYSTEM. IN CALIFORNIA STATE CODE SPEAKS TO FORMATIVE. YEAH I DON'T SEE MUCH ON THE FORMATIVE FRONT I SEE SOME INTERIM THERE'S BEEN SOME ALTERATIONS OF THAT TO MAKE IT. SO THE CLASSROOM TEACHERS LOW OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS A CLASSROOM TEACHER COULD IDENTIFY. HOW OTHER STUDENTS ARE DOING ON ON THOSE STANDARDS WOULD. WHEN CAN WE GET MORE FORMATIVE. ARE YOU GOING TO TRY ARE YOU. SO AS AS THE CONSORTIUM DEFINES THE FORMATIVE- PROCESS THE TOOLS FOR TEACHERS AYE- I AM CONFIDENT WILL BETTER ADDRESS- BOTH MY AND HOPEFULLY YOUR DEFINITION OF FORMATIVE PROCESS- I AGREE- WE DID NOT HIT THE MARK ON THE DIGITAL LIBRARY IT WAS THE RESOURCES WERE NOT- WE'RE NOT ENGAGING- THEY WERE NOT HELLO THEY WERE NOT- CONSISTENTLY ORGANIZED- THEY OVER HALF EMPHASIZE PROCESS AND THEY DIDN'T- SUFFICIENTLY ADDRESS RESOURCE- AND I THINK THERE IS A PARTICULAR. GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY TIME YOU LOOKED AT A RESOURCE YOU YOU SAW THE ENTIRE FORMATIVE PROCESS LAID OUT- SO WHAT WE REALLY FOCUSED ON WAS- BEING AND ISN'T THAT- THERE ARE GOING TO BE MASTER TEACHERS THEY'RE GONNA BE USING THAT AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE OFFICE TEACHERS. AND SO BEING ABLE TO TURN THE DIAL OFF AND LETTING PEOPLE SEE GO INTO THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED BEING ABLE TO SEE MULTIPLE STEPS THEY WANT SEE STEPS BEING. JUST THE RESOURCES THEY AND WHY IF THEY IF THEY KNOW THE MUSCLES I'M KIND OF CONFUSED WITH THE WIND I'M STARTING TO PAY OFF MULTIPLES WHEN I'M TO SEE IS I WANT. I WANT QUESTION I WANT TO SEE I WANT TO SEE WHAT THE TEST IS THE I DON'T TEACH THE- EVERY. BUT I CERTAINLY WANT TO ACCESS TO IT SO I CAN EVEN AT THE END OF THE DAY I CAN PUT UP ONE QUESTION. AND WE CAN VERBALLY GOAL OR IT'LL TAKE THREE MINUTES NO IT'S A IT'S A QUICK THING. SO THAT'S SO SOME F THE MEN ARE DOWN- THE OF THE FOR- IS SO WE WILL BE MAKING AVAILABLE FREE IN TERM ASSESSMENT ITEMS IN A POOL- WHICH WILL ALLOW- TEACHERS TO SELECT A PARTICULAR ITEM AND PRINT ABOUT AND PRESENT THEM IN AS PART OF A FORMATIVE PROCESS WHICH MAKES AN AVAILABLE- A LITTLE BIT MORE EASIER AS PART OF THE FORMATIVE- SO AS A SORT pLIBRARY IS OF MORE ABOUT- STRUCTURING AN ACTIVITY IN A LISTENINGSPECIFIC INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF- ELICITING. INFORMATION TO UNDERSTAND MISCONCEPTIONS AND- AND TO SOLIDIFY- DETERMINE PROFICIENCY- AS PART OF A FOUR MINUTE PROCESS WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO. BOTH OF THOSE TOOLS- IN AS LARGE AS PART OF THE LARGER FORMATIVE PROCESS OKAY THANK YOU WANT ONE MAYBE THIS IS JUST ON A LEAVE THIS QUESTION ON THE TABLE. BUT BEHIND ME BUT- REALLY I DON'T SEE ENOUGH EMPHASIS ON THE FORMATIVE SO I JUST WANT TO TAKE HIS BACK TO THE CONSORTIUM IF YOU COULD OKAY DESCRIPTION- IT AND REALLY FOCUS ON THE FORUM FORMATIVE ELEMENTS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THAT'S REALLY NEEDS WHAT HAPPENS. WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN BECAUSE AGAIN I. THE SUMMATIVE IS PRETTY MUCH DONE WE KNOW THAT IT'S BAKED QUE- BUT I'M REALLY NOT SEEN A LOT EMPHASIS EMPHASIS ON THE FORM GIVEN THE AND WHAT HAPPENS IS. AGAIN WHEN THE TEACHERS AT TEN. ENGINE TO A THE EDGE WHEN THEY GOT THE TEST. RIGHT AND AGAIN I SAID I DON'T WANT THEM TESTING ALL DAY BUT I WANT THEM TO HAVE THE TOOLS NECESSARY. TO MATCH. YOU KNOW WHAT THE TEST RECORD EITHER WITH TEST REQUIRES OUR STUDENTS SO JUST TAKE THAT BACK. YOU HEARD ME SAY I DON'T BELIEVE. YOU YOU- ARE REALLY BEING VERY AGGRESSIVE ON THE FORMATIVE FRONT. OKAY AND I JUST CUT A COUPLE OTHER QUESTIONS JUST QUIT CANCER THE TEST LANCASTER ANYWAY ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO SHORTEN THE TESTING AT THE SAME DATA. OR OR OR- SO WE HAVE BEEN DOING STUDIES ON THE LENGTH OF THE TESTING NO THAT WE STARTED WITHOUT WITH SCIENCE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO THE LENGTH OF THE SCIENCE AND FILAMENT MAYBE PERHAPS JUST THE ENGLISH AND MATH AND SMARTER SINCE WORK ON AYE AYE REFERRING TO JUST THE- SMARTER BALANCED. IT ENGLISH AND MATH. BECAUSE THE SCIENCES- SEPARATE YES SEPARATE. YEAH SO ENGLISH AND I JUST THINK SO ARE IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO SHORTEN THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES A TEST BECAUSE YOU KNOW SCHOOL SET ASIDE TWO THREE WEEKS OF THE YEAR OR EVERYTHING STERN SIDE DOWN BECAUSE IT'S TESTING TIME TESTING TIME. IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO ELIMINATE THAT DINO SO SOMEONE OF A DIE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE CONSTANTLY LOOKING AT THAT- WE'RE- INVESTIGATING- AS A SLIMMER DIRECTIONS SAT ON THE PERFORMANCE TASK- FOR E. LA- TO REDUCE THE VOLUME OF READING THAT A STUDENT NEEDS TO DO TO UNDERSTAND THE PERFORMANCE HAS SO- WE PLAN TO FIELD TEST THAT. THIS UPCOMING SPRING- TO REDUCE THE COMPLEXITY REDUCE LIVE READING ALOUD SO ARE WERE OPTIMISTIC THAT THAT WILL REDUCE THE- THE- READING TIME FOR THE LA TEST- IT'S REALLY THE NUMBER IT APPEARS THE NUMBER OF STIMULI THAT A STUDENT READ. OUT OF RIGHT THAT IS DOES THIS IS REALLY A IN. IN THE TOTAL TESTING SITE SO WILL ABSOLUTELY CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THAT- WILL BE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT THAT- AND IT'S- ULTIMATELY A COMPROMISE BETWEEN- THE AMOUNT OF A XIN WANTS OUT OF IT AND KIND OF TIME THAT IT TAKES ENTER SO. WILL COTINUE TO WORK WITH PART AND CAN TO TRY DRESS. THANK YOU THANK YOU- IN JUST A COUPLE OF JUST TESTING PLATFORM THERE'S BEEN AN ANSWER THAT I APPRECIATE THAT I HOPE WE CAN CONTINUE TO SLEEP. THAT TO SAMPLE SHE WOULD REST SOME OF THE HEY I THINK BLEEDS INTO MY FORM COM. TO USERS THE TEACHERS NEED. YEAH AND THAT I'M GONNA BE QUITE IF THERE ARE OTHERS WHO WISH TO SHARE ANY THOUGHTS OR HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. NOPE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO ONE OF OUR PANELISTS MAKE IT. THE NUMBER. AND WE'RE NOW GOING TO BRING UP- PANEL NUMBER TWO AND THESE ARE THE FOLKS ON THE GROUND THAT ADMINISTER THE TEST AND- OUR INNER SCHOOLS JUST ABOUT EVERY DAY IF NOT EVERY DAY WILL. FIRST BRING UP- MICHAEL FOR CHAT. IS THE MATH INSTRUCTIONAL COACH FROM JULIE AND LEAST TAG ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. AND HE'S HERE OKAY. HE'S HERE FROM THE SAME SCHOOL AS MISS HOMES WHAT NOT INTRODUCE WHO WAS FIRST ON THE LISTER. SHE IS PRINCIPLE- JULIE AND THE STAG ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN THERE IN THE SENATE FROM THE SAN MARCOS. UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND THEN WILL ALSO BRING UP- DAVID LAWLER USE THE ENGLISH TEACHER FROM KERN HIGH SCHOOL DAVID. AREAS AND CHRISTOPHER MOORE ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT FOR EDUCATIONAL SERVICES FROM THE ELDORADO. UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THANK YOU FOR GIVING US TIME OUT OF YOUR DâN INTO SOME OF YOU. TRAVEL FROM FAR FREE SHEET THAT VERY MUCH WE'RE GONNA START WITH OUR PRINCIPLE THIS ON ANDREA HOMES. THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL AND MEMBERS OF THE EDUCATIONAL COMMITTEE WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL TO BE HERE. AND AGAIN I'M ENTRY HOMES IN THE PRINCIPLE CHILLINGLY SINUSES MIKE HE'S MY MATH COACH- I WANTED TO TAKE A MINUTE TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY SCHOOL GIVE YOU SOME CONTEXT FROM THE LENS THAT WE ARE SPEAKING TO TODAY- AND- WE ARE. HEY WE ARE PART OF SAN MARCOS UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY. OUR SCHOOL HAS ROUGHLY SEVEN HUNDRED STUDENTS 80% OF OUR STUDENTS ARE AT THE POVERTY LINE 78% ARE HISPANIC. AND ABOUT 50% OF OUR STUDENTS ARE ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS ALTHOUGH WE SUSPECT THAT PERCENTAGE IS MUCH HIGHER BECAUSE IT DEPENDS ON HOW. WE STILL OUT THE LANGUAGE SERVING MOST OF OUR FAMILIES DO NOT SPEAK ENGLISH SO I AM PRACTICING MY SPANISH SO THAT I CAN COMMUNICATE MORE EFFECTIVELY WITH THEM AND I GET BETTER EVERY SINGLE DAY. I WE WERE CARD AT TO GET OUR FAMILIES ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THEIR CHILDREN'S LEARNING. IT IS OUR GREATEST CHALLENGE AND- AS A MATTER OF FACT WE HAVE THE HIGHEST- CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM OF THE ENTIRE DISTRICT SO THAT'S ONE OF OUR CHALLENGES AT OUR SITE WE WORK VERY HARD AT THIS WEEK CAN WITH HER FAMILIES WE ARE WORKSHOPS WE HAVE COFFEE CHATS WITH FAMILY DAYS EVERYTHING WE CAN DO TO GET THEM IN. BUT IT HIS- CHANGED THAT KIND OF CAPS AND HE IS A VERY LITTLE SO WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR SUPERINTENDENT TO WORK ON PROVIDING TRANSPORTATION TO OUR STUDENTS BECAUSE WE'RE THE ONLY DISTRICT OR THE ONLY SCHOOL IN OUR DISTRICT THAT HAS A UNIQUE BOUNDARY LINE AND SO IT'S AN EQUITY ISSUE FOR FAMILIES THEY HAVE TROUBLE GETTING THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL SO WE'RE WORKING ON THAT THAT'S OUR CHALLENGE. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND ONE OF OUR GREATEST SIX. IS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO CREATE A MATHEMATICS LABORATORY SCHOOL. WHY WE HAVE A MATH COACH. AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO OUR LABORATORY TO CREATE HIGH QUALITY TEACHING AND LEARNING THAT'S RESULTING IN STUDENTS WHO ARE. HIGHLY COMPETENT CONFIDENT AND HAVE A POSITIVE DISPOSITION TOWARDS MATHEMATICS AND ACTUALLY. THEY ARE OUTPERFORMING. OUR DISTRICT AVERAGE SO WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THAT. SO THAT'S A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHO WE ARE AND I WANTED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHY WE ARE HERE WE WANTED TO SHARE SOME CONCERNS WE HAVE REGARDING ASPECT HAS SIXTEEN. AS WELL AS IDEAS- FOR CHANGING FOR IMPROVEMENT. SO WELL- EXPECTS ONLINE ASSESSMENT HAS OBVIOUSLY MADE- TESTING MUCH MORE EFFICIENT THAN PREVIOUS TEST. AND IT IS A LINE TO THE STATE STANDARDS THERE ARE MANY CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE THAT IT DOESN'T TRULY ENCAPSULATE WHAT CHILDREN KNOWING OR ABLE TO DO. NOR DOES IT SUPPORT TEACHERS IN UNDERSTANDING WHAT STUDENTS KNOW FOR THE PURPOSES OF IMPACTING. THEIR INSTRUCTION OR BECOMING INTEGRAL PART OF THEIR INSTRUCTION. AND TO THAT END THE USEFULNESS OF THE INFORMATION THAT ASPECT PROVIDES COMES INTO QUESTION. UNDERSTANDABLE FOR THE IMPORTANCE AND NEED FOR SOMEBODY FROM AN ASSISTANT ASSESSMENT. HOWEVER THE PURPOSE OF ASSESSMENT SHOULD BE TO SHOW ALWAYS GUIDE INSTRUCTION. I'M WHETHER IT'S SOMEONE EVER FORMATIVE SUMMATIVE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GIVE SPECIFIC INFORMATION TO A TEACHER THAT WILL BETTER PREPARE THAT TEACHERS IMPACT HIS OR HER INSTRUCTION. EVEN IF IT'S IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR NOT WITH THE SAME STUDENTS IT DOES GIVE INFORMATION TO THE CHILD BUT THE WAY IT'S- DELIVERED NOW IS NOT VERY USEFUL TO TEACHERS. THE REPORTS THAT ARE GENERATED FROM THE RESULTS OF THIS TEST MIGHT DO NOT PROVIDE CRITICAL INFORMATION. AND FOR EXAMPLE IN THE AREA OF MATHEMATICS THE SCORES ARE BASED ON THREE BANDS THERE'S CONCEPT AND PROCEDURES THERE'S PROBLEM SOLVING MODELING AND DATA ANALYSIS AND FINALLY THERE'S COMMUNICATING REASONING. AND BECAUSE THESE BANDS ARE BROUGHT IN THEIR CONTENT QUESTIONS ARE OFTEN- MULTIPLE STANDARDS ARE INCLUDED IN ONE QUESTION AND AS A RESULT IT'S DIFFICULT FOR TEACHERS OR ADMINISTRATORS DETERMINE IF AT ALL. AND EXACTLY WHAT WHAT IS WHAT WITHIN THE BAND IS THE RELATIVE AREA OF STRENGTH OR WEAKNESS. AND THEREFORE IT'S DIFFICULT TO FOCUS FUTURE INSTRUCTION AND FOR PARENTS THAT SOME TO REPORT ONLY GIVES GENERAL INFORMATION WITH LINKS TO PRACTICE TEST. AND AGAIN NOT pAREAS OF DEFICIT THAT NEED ADDRESSING. NOT IN TERMS ASMAN VERY MIGHT BE A LITTLE STEP TOWARDS FORMATIVE- ASSESSMENT HOWEVER TEACHERS AREN'T YET ABLE TO DIRECTLY ACCESS THE RESULTS AT THIS POINT. TAKE EITHER INSTRUCTION INSTEAD THEIR RESULTS ARE GENERATED BY CLASS AND NOT BY GRADE. AND THEY'RE GENERATED TO A TESTING ADMINISTRATOR WHO THEN HAS TO SORT IT OUT. AND THEN PASS THAT INFORMATION ON TO THE TEACHERS WHO THEN HAVE TO LOOK FOR THEIR OWN STUDENTS AND THEN MAKE SENSE OF WHAT QUESTIONS THEY WERE ABLE TO- ANSWER CORRECTLY AND NOT. OR NOT AT THE FEEDBACK THAT WE RECEIVED IN OUR DISTRICT REGARDING THE IN TERMS IS FAVORABLE ONLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF PRACTICING THE TOOLS. ON THE ASPECT BUT HAS LACKED IN PROVIDING VALUABLE INFORMATION THAT IS NEEDED TO GUIDE INSTRUCTION. I TEACHERS ALSO REPORT THAT. QUESTIONS CAN BE CONFUSING AND AN EXAMPLE IN THIRD GRADE AND WHAT IS THE LEAST TOLD NUMBER THAT CAN BE ROUNDED TO FORTY. SO IT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE AT ONE OF OUR HIGHEST PERFORMING SCHOOLS IN OUR DISTRICT. HER PERCENT THE KIDS MISS THIS QUESTION. HOWEVER MULTIPLE OTHER MATTERS STUDENTS WERE SHOWING PROFICIENCY IN IT SO WE REALLY BECAME OF AT AT. A QUESTION ABOUT THE LANGUAGE OF THE TEST. SO WHAT HAPPENS IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE IS THAT WE START TEACHING TO THE TEST. AND NOT SOMETHING THAT WE WERE HOPING TO GET AWAY FROM WITH THE PREVIOUS. MORE MY THERE'S A REPORTING THAT. THE SAME QUESTION APPEAR IN THE ASP HERE AFTER YEAR WHICH I THINK I DON'T BELIEVE WAS THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE S. BACK. AND I SAID I THINK YOU MENTIONED BEFORE MAKE IT- YOU KNOW THE PURPOSE OF COMMON CORE WAS TO REALLY GET OUR KIDS TO COLLABORATE NEST RICH DEEP RICH PROBLEM SOLVING TASKS AND HAVE COMMUNICATION BUT THEN ULTIMATELY THEY'RE ASSESSED IN A DIFFERENT WAY. SO THERE'S LESS TIME ON THAT COLLABORATION AND MORE TIME ON PRACTICING FOR THAT TEST. AND FOR US CULTURAL SENSITIVITY FOR OUR STUDENTS AND TAKING THE TEST IS A HUGE CONCERN- THERE'S GROWING ATTENTION AND FRANKLY I NEED TO ENSURE THAT OUR STUDENTS HAVE. EQUITABLE ACCESS. TO EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY EQUITY DOESN'T MEAN THAT EVERYBODY IS EQUAL RATHER IT MEANS THAT STUDENTS GET WHAT THEY NEED. SO MANY OF OUR STUDENTS ARE EXPECTED TO TAKE THE ASPECT BEFORE THEY BECOME FLUENT ENGLISH SPEAKERS. AND WHICH ONLY REALLY ASSESSES THEIR LANGUAGE ACQUISITION AUTHOR UNDERSTAND THE CONTENT WE DO APPRECIATE THE ACCOMMODATIONS- THAT ARE AVAILABLE THIS TEXT TO SPEECH FOR EXAMPLE OR THE POP UP GLOSSARIES. HOWEVER THESE ARE NOT YET UNIVERSAL'S TOOLS FOR ALL STUDENTS AND THEIR YET TO BE GIVEN IN ITS ENTIRETY IN THE STUDENTS HOME LANGUAGE. ADDITIONALLY THE CONTEXT OF SOME THE QUESTIONS WHILE THEY ARE REAL WORLD AND WE DO APPRECIATE THAT AND SLEEPY. AND DATE DEPT THEY SOMETIMES FALL OUTSIDE THE EXPERIENCE OF OUR STUDENTS AND POVERTY FOR EXAMPLE IN FIFTH GRADE MATHEMATICS ASSESSMENT STUDENTS ARE ASKED TO PLAN A DAY AT THE FAIR. AND WE AGREED TO KEEP THIS QUESTION TO ASSESS PREPARE IMPRIMATUR HOWEVER MANY STUDENTS HAVE NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO A FAIR. AND THEREFORE NO ACCESS TO THE VERY PREMISE OF THE QUESTION WHICH THEN MAKES THE QUESTION IS EQUITABLE FOR ALL STUDENTS. TO ADD ON OUR IMPROPER STUDENTS ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY MAY AND MANY IF NOT MOST CASES BE GREATLY LIMITED AND THEREFORE DEPENDS ON THE FUNDING AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL OR THE SITE LEVEL. BECAUSE THE TOOLS ON ASPECT REQUIRE PRACTICE THIS ONCE AGAIN. ONCE AGAIN POSES AN EQUITY ISSUE FOR STUDENTS THIS IS ESPECIALLY THE CASE WHEN LOOKING AT A GROWING BODY OF COMPETING RESEARCH EXAM FINANCE SCREEN TIME IN THE CLASSROOM. CAN ACTUALLY BE INHIBITORY TO STUDENT LEARNING. EXCEPTIONALLY WELL WELL INTENTIONED S. BACK DOES BECOME A TEST OF STAMINA. SPECIFICALLY AT THE ELEMENTARY LEVEL WE'RE ASKING OUR EIGHT TO ELEVEN YEAR OLDS TO SPEND FOUR TO FIVE DATE IS TWO TO THREE. HOURS EACH DAY TAKING THIS TEST. RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT THE AVERAGE STUDENTS OUR STUDENTS HAVE A SUSTAINED ATTENTION SPAN. OF THREE TO FIVE MINUTES FOR EVERY YEAR THEY ARE ALIVE SO THE AVERAGE NINE YEAR OLD IN THIRD GRADE WOULD HAVE AN- ATTENTION SPAN BETWEEN TWENTY SEVEN FORTY MINUTES. IT'S NOT UNTIL SEVENTH GRADE AT A CHILD AT THE HIGHER END OF THE NORMAL RANGE WOULD HAVE ROUGHLY A SIXTY MINUTE ATTENTION SPAN. AND MAYBE ARGUE THAT ASPECT ALLOWS FOR TESTING WINDOW THAT WOULD SHORTEN TESTING ON A GIVEN DAY HOWEVER THERE ANY ARE VERY. THERE ARE MANY INHIBITORY FACTORS THAT PREVENTS THIS INCLUDING DISTRICT PASTING CALENDARS DEVICES ACCESS TO DEVICES AND THE CHALLENGE OF STOPPING RETURN ON COMPUTER ADAPTIVE PORTION OF THE ASSESSMENT. ONE LAST GOING TO SWITCH OUT HERE. ONE LAST CONCERN CONSERVING- S. BACK AND- YES THERE ARE MULTIPLE DAYS THAT THE TEST IS ADMINISTERED BUT EACH DAY IS A DIFFERENT PORTION OF THE TEST THAT CAN LAST FOR MANY ANYTIME FROM ONE TO THREE HOURS. AND FOR EACH PART PORTION STUDENTS GET ONE SHOT AT IT NOW. FOR THINGS LIKE THE ACT AND THE SAT IN THE ELSE AT. THOSE KINDS OF ASSESSMENT A HOST OF OTHER STUDENTS ARE ALLOWED TO RETAKE THE ASSESSMENT AS MANY TIMES AS THEY LIKE NOW WE'RE NOT ESPOUSING EIGHT AND ELEVEN YEAR OLDS TO TAKE FIFTEEN OUR TEST MULTIPLE TIMES BUT- THIS IS HIGH TECH HIGH STAKES TESTING. AND MUCH RIDES ON THESE RESULTS SO WOULD IT BE GREAT IF WE WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR OPTIMAL CONDITIONS TO TRULY ASSESS PROGRESS OVER TIME. AS TO WHAT STUDENTS KNOW. NOT IDEAS FOR IMPROVEMENT AS WE STATED BEFORE THERE IS ABSOLUTELY PURPOSE AN IMPORTANT IN MEASURING A STUDENT'S LEARNING OVER A YEAR'S TIME HOWEVER. THERE'S MUCH THAT CAN BE DONE TO YIELD THE MOST ACCURATE MEASURE. ADDRESSING THE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT WE JUST MENTIONED WE BELIEVE WOULD DEFINITELY WORK TOWARDS BETTER UNDERSTANDING WHAT STUDENTS ACTUALLY NO AND WHAT THEY'RE ABLE TO DO. THERE'S NO DOUBT IN OUR MINDS THAT THAT THIS HIGH TAKES THIS HIGH STAKES TEST HAS AT THE MINIMUM MADE STRIDES TOWARD TECHNOLOGY THE NEED FOR STUDENTS TO THINK DEEPLY AND CRITICALLY. BUT WE WONDER IS ARE WE REALLY ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTION HERE- TO BETTER SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS IN LEARNING AND ASSESSING WHAT THEY'VE LEARNED. THE PROGRAM OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENT ASSESSMENT WHICH IS KNOWN AS PISA. HAS PROVEN THAT WE HAVE AS A COUNTRY MADE LITTLE IMPROVEMENT PRUDENT. SINCE ITS EXCEPTION IN TO THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND. EVEN WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COMMON CORE STANDARDS IN TWO THOUSAND TEN WHICH ATTEMPTED TO BETTER PREPARE STUDENTS FOR THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND FOR THE JOBS THAT DEMANDED CRITICAL THINKING. COLLABORATION CREATIVITY AND COMMUNICATION WE STILL HAVE REMAINED STAGNANT AND FAR. FAR BEHIND DEVELOPED COUNTRIES YEAR AFTER YEAR. SO WE KNOW THE WHAT. THAT'S CLEARLY COMMUNICATED BUT WHAT WE FELT THAT IS THE HOUSE. THAT IS THE HOUSE HOW DO WE DEVELOP OUR TEACHERS AND HIGH QUALITY RESOURCES. TO SUPPORT LEARNING THE STUDENTS IN BECOMING THE CRITICAL THINKING THINKERS AND PROBLEM SOLVERS FOR THE JOBS THAT DEMAND THESE VERY SKILLS. NOW WE KNOW FROM THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SCHOOL LEADERSHIP AND FROM EXTENSIVE RESEARCH AND HOW PEOPLE LEARNED THAT THE GREATEST IMPACT ON STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT IS THROUGH EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTION AND FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT THAT'S BEEN PROVEN. ASPECT HAS MADE AN ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS THE FORMATIVE PIECE HOWEVER THIS MUCH TO BE IMPROVED TO TRULY INFORM INSTRUCTION. BUT WE'VE DONE LITTLE TO NOTHING AT THE NATIONAL OR STATE LEVEL TO ADDRESS THE INSTRUCTIONAL PIECE. IF THINK EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNTS OF MONEY THAT IT COSTS TO ADMINISTER IT TO ADMINISTER STANDARDIZED TEST. THAT FOR THE MOST PART IS SUMMATIVE COULD INSTEAD BE PUT TOWARDS FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT THAT TEACHERS CAN ACTUALLY USE AND ARE HELPFUL AND CAN BE APPLIED TO PRACTICE. IN IT AND BE PUT TOWARDS TO SUPPORTING PROFESSIONAL LEARNING AND TEACHERS WE COULD IN FACT BE MAKING A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE. IN STUDENT LEARNING. WHEN YOU THE CLIP ART TEACHERS. IN BECOMING MATHEMATICS AND LITERACY EXPERTS. WE NEED TO RAISE THEIR CONTENT AND PEDAGOGICAL KNOWLEDGE AS WELL AS OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE BEST INSTRUCTIONAL PRACTICE SO HIGH. THAT THEY CAN MAKE THE BEST INSTRUCTIONAL DECISIONS TO SUPPORT THE STUDENTS IN OBTAINING THE SKILLS. THAT THEY REQUIRED FOR THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. THAT WOULD TRULY BE A HIGH QUALITY ALIGN INSTRUCTIONAL SYSTEM. IT TOO WE ADDRESS THE HOW UNTIL WE GET BETTER AT THIS PIECE WILL NOT MOVE THE NEEDLE ON THE STATE THE NATIONAL OR THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WELL DONE. OUR NEXT PRESENTER. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL VICE CHAIRMAN KILEY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY MY NAME IS DAVID LAWLER. I TEACH IN THE KERN HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT IN BAKERSFIELD AND I'M ALSO THE CHAIRMAN OF THE ASSESSMENT TESTING COMMITTEE FOR THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. BUT TODAY I SPEAK AS AN INDIVIDUAL. WITH TWENTY SEVEN SCHOOL SITES AND FORTY THOUSAND STUDENTS THE KERN HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT IS THE LARGEST SINGLE HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE STATE. AT MY SITE GOLDEN VALLEY HIGH WE HAVE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS. 85% OF WHICH ARE HISPANIC 90% OF WHICH ARE SOCIO ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED. THEREFORE MY FRUSTRATION WITH THE S. BACK WAS WITH ITS TEACHER RESOURCES. THE ORIGINAL ROLL OUT OF THE DIGITAL LIBRARY WAS MYSTERIOUS THERE WAS GOSSIP ABOUT A FEW TEACHERS BEING ABLE TO ACCESS SOME. DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE WEBSITE DENSELY PACKED WITH LESS THAN USEFUL AND LESS THAN USER FRIENDLY MATERIAL AND THERE WAS LITTLE TRAINING A LITTLE UNDERSTANDING OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM HENCE. WE WERE FRUSTRATED THAT WE SHARED OUR CRITICISM ABOUT THE DISCONNECTED DATA AND THE UNCLEAR UNUSABLE LESSON PLANS ON THE SITE. AND I BELIEVE WE WERE HURT THE TEACHERS IN THE CLASSROOM WHO HAD TO USE THIS SYSTEM- WERE HEARD REGARDING THE DIGITAL LIBRARY WHAT WE NOW NEED FROM THE NEW SYSTEM INCLUDES. A LIST OF SPECIFIC SKILLS BEING ADDRESSED AT EACH GRADE LEVEL AND WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE ALIGNMENT TO THE COMMON CORE STANDARDS OUR TEACHERS WERE SO CONFUSED BY THE DIGITAL LIBRARY WE NEED MORE SOURCES SOLVE THE- WHIMS JENNA. ERIN LEE IN THE US BACK SO HAVE WEBSITE WE CAN HE AND NAVIGATE WITH SKILLS AND STANDARDS THAT WERE TESTED WILL HELP RESOLVE THIS FRUSTRATION. USABE INTERIM AND FORMATIVE ASSESSMENTS DIRECTLY TIED TO SKILLS AND GRADE LEVELS AS WELL AND BY USABLE I MEAN TO INFORM INSTRUCTION. OUR NINTH AND TENTH GRADE TEACHERS HAD NO DATA TO ANALYZE ONLY THE ELEVENTH GRADE TEACHERS TESTING THE US BACKED IT WITHOUT DATA ARE NINE TO TENTH GRADE TEACHERS WERE FLYING BLIND. ALSO THE OLD DATA WAS NOT HELPFUL WHEN FOR EXAMPLE READING RESULTS CAME OUT. BUT HAD NO INDICATORS FOR WHICH SPECIFIC READING SKILLS TESTED MAIN IDEA SUPPORTING DETAILS INFERENCE. WHEN THE DATA IS ALIGNED TO COMMON CORE STANDARDS IT DOES FURTHER INFORM TEACHERS TO IDENTIFY BUT ONLY WITH EACH STUDENT NEEDS. WHAT DIRECTION SCHOOLS CAN MOVE THEIR GLOBAL INSTRUCTIONAL PATTERNS IN THEIR CURRICULUM MAPS. WE ALSO NEED MORE TRAINING ON THE SYSTEM. TEACHERS USUALLY RIGHT THERE ON TEST SO THEY KNOW WHAT THE INSTRUCTIONAL AND GAME IS GOING TO BE. A TEACHER VERSION OF THE S. BACK AND MORE PRACTICE TEST WILL HELP WITH THAT AND CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL YOUR BILL AB NINE OH EIGHT ADDRESSES THIS IT IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I THANK YOU FOR IT. IN THE COMING YEARS YOU HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO THE SMARTER BALANCED SYSTEM MORE DYNAMIC WHAT SHOULD IT BE. A MULTI PURPOSE INSTRUMENT THAT CAN EMPOWER STUDENTS TO SELF MONITOR THEIR OWN LEARNING. INFORM TEACHERS TO ADJUST THEIR INSTRUCTION ALLOW DISTRICTS TO MEASURE ACCOUNTABILITY AND COMFORT LEGISLATORS TURN THE STATUTES AND COMPLIANCE BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE. THE DASHBOARD IS SUFFICIENT FOR GAUGING PUPIL ACHIEVEMENT THERE FOR INSPECTION NOT HAVE OR VAL ON THE DASHBOARD THAT DOES NOW. YEAH TNA. A THIS CALL. TUNES WITH IMMENSE DE. RIFT OVERALL IN HIGH. BUT HIRE YOU ON THE S. SINCE IT'S NOW LOST IN THE CROWD OF. GIVING MORE TIME TO FOR. ON COLLEGE CAREER OF. STOOD TAKE THE S. BACK IN THE SPRING WE GET THE RESULTS IN THE FALL WHEN STUDENTS HAVE MOVED ON TO ANOTHER GRADE AND ANOTHER TEACHER THE ASPECT RESULTS MUST BE DELIVERED IN A TIMELY MANNER. I HOPE THESE THREE IDEAS DO STICK WITH YOU THE ASPECT NEEDS NO MORE WEIGHT ON THE DASHBOARD. SINCE THE ACT AND SAT OR NOW IRRELEVANT TO THE POINT OF EXTINCTION TEACHERS COULD FOCUS ON THE EXPECT. WHICH REQUIRES HAVING ITS RESULTS DELIVERED IN A MORE TIMELY MANNER CONSEQUENTLY MEANINGFUL FORMATIVE ASSESSMENTS ARE NOW MORE URGENT AND NECESSARY AND IT ALL STARTS WITH BETTER TRAINING FOR TEACHERS SO THE SYSTEM ITSELF IS NO LONGER A BARRIER TO OUR STUDENTS. BECOMES AN INTEGRAL EMBEDDED ANCHOR PERHAPS THE GUIDE POST FOR CALIFORNIANS ENTIRE LEARNING EXPERIENCE. THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME SPEAK THANK YOU. IT'S MY A GREAT PRESIDENT TO ADDRESS- THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION FOR THIS INFORMATION HERE ON THE US BACK I'D ALSO LIKE TO PERSONALLY THANK A TERMINAL DOWN ON HIS STAFF- FOR THEIR COMMUNICATION SUPPORT I'M CHRISTOPHER MORE THE ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT OF EDUCATIONAL SERVICES FOR THE ELDORADO UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT. I'VE SERVED IN PUBLIC EDUCATION FOR OVER TWO DECADES AND I'M A GRADUATE OF THE CALIFORNIA K. THROUGH- UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. I BY THE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO TEACH IN URBAN AREAS- AGRICULTURAL AREAS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN ADDITION I'VE BEEN A SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR IN PRINCIPLE IN THE BAY AREA THAT A PLURALITY ASIAN STUDENTS I'VE ALSO. PRINCE WITH A LARGE COMPREHENSIVE HIGH SCHOOL WHOSE BOUNDARY WITH SOBRE AND RELIABLE FOR THE NINE YEAR I'D CONSUMER OF IS SERVE. I DISAGREE SIXTEEN HUNDRED STUDENTS THAT OUT FOR COMPREHENSIVE HIGH SCHOOLS WONDER WHEN DISTRICT FUNDED PREPARATORY CHARTER HIGH SCHOOL AND A CONTINUATION OF SCHOOL. THE PURPOSE OF MY OPENING STATEMENT IS TO PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE WITH MY EXPERIENCES WITH THE ASPECTS SOME JIM INFORMING ASSESSMENTS. INCLUDING THE ASPECT TOOLS TO SUPPORT AND IMPROVE INSTRUCTIONAL PRACTICES. I BELIEVE I PROVIDING UNIQUE ADMINISTRATIVE PERSPECTIVE IN THAT I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COMMON CORE STATE STANDARDS AND THE SHIFT FROM THE CALIFORNIA. STANDARDS TEST TO THE ASPECT ASSESSMENTS FROM CONCEPTION TO PRESS PRESENT AS WAS REFERENCED- EARLYIN THE OPENING STATEMENTS. I ALSO WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES AND IN I YOU'LL YOU'LL HEAR SIMILAR COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN ALREADY. BEEN EXPRESSED. THEREFORE CALIFORNIA UPDATES CONTENT STANDARDS FOR THE CHRISTIAN FRAMERS IS MY ROLE TO PROVIDE THE SUPPORT AND TRAINING AND RESOURCES NEEDED NEEDED TO ENABLE OUR TEACHERS TO IMPLEMENT THE STANDARDS AND FRAMEWORKS. TO BENEFIT STUDENTS TO IMPROVE EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES FOR ALL STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR SOCIOECONOMIC SITUATION THEIR ETHNICITY RACE GENDER IDENTITY HOME LANGUAGE OR CITIZENSHIP STATUS. OKAY I BELIEVE THAT WE ALL AGREE THAT THE CALIFORNIA ASSESSMENT SYSTEM SHOULD LEAD TO IMPROVED EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES FOR ALL STUDENTS. WITH THAT SAID I BELIEVE SOME THAT THE CHALLENGE WE'RE FACING TODAY IS THAT SOME THE TO THE SUBSTANCE BY NATURE PROVIDE TEACHERS WITH INFORMATION ON WHETHER STUDENTS HAVE CLEARED AND IDENTIFIED LEARNING BAR BUT THEY DO NOT PROVIDE CLASSROOM TEACHERS WITH INFORMATION ON HOW TO GET THE STUDENTS. OVER THE BAR SO FOR EXAMPLE IF I WERE TO PUT UP A HIGH JUMP IN HERE AND I SET THE STANDARD FOR ALL OF YOU IT'S A CLEAR FIVE FEET. I HAVE THE BAR AND IT'S NOW UP TO ME TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO TRAIN YOU GIVEN YOUR FITNESS LEVELS TO GET OVER THE BAR. THE ASSESSMENT ITSELF THE STANDARD ITSELF DOES NOT TELL ME HOW TO DO THAT. IN MY OPINION THEN THE GREATEST CHALLENGE THE US BACK SYSTEM. HAS HAS BEEN ACTUALLY THE STATE WIDE OUTCOMES. NOT SURE THIS WITH YOU BECAUSE IF WE DO WE IF THE INTENT OF OUR SYSTEM WAS TO IMPROVE EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES FOR ALL STUDENTS. THEN WHY IS IT THAT OF OUR ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS. ARE MEETING THE CALIFORNIA STANDARDS FOR MATHEMATICS WHY IS IT THAT ONLY 21% OF OUR AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS. ARE MEETING THE STANDARDS FOR MATHEMATICS THE CALIFORNIA STANDARDS. AND WHY IS IT THAT ALL THAT ONLY 20% OF OUR LET NEXT STUDENTS. ARE MEETING THE STANDARDS SO. THAT WAS THE BILL THE SYSTEM WITH THE A PETITION COME A QUARTER WAS IN CREW WAS TO CREATE MORE EQUITABLE ACT OUTCOMES. WE OUGHT TO ALL RECOGNIZE THAT WERE FALLING- WERE FALLING SHORT. ON THIS. I'M NOT BLAMING THE ASSESSMENT SYSTEM- FOR PRODUCING SUCH DISPARATE OUTCOMES BY STUDENT GROUPS. BUT WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE TO OURSELVES BUT IF THE NEW STANDARDS AND THE SYSTEM SYSTEM WAS SUPPOSED TO BE TRANSFORMATIVE. WE HAVE THE LEAST TO DATE COME UP SHORT. NOW JOHN HARDY IS ONE OF THE LEADING EDUCATIONAL RESEARCHERS IN THE PLANET TODAY. AND HE EXPLAINS THE TEACHER COLLECTIVE EFFICACY HAS THE GREATEST IMPACT ON STUDENT LEARNING. HOW THE STATE'S IT'S ESSENTIAL TO HELP EDUCATORS MAKE THE LINK BETWEEN THEIR COLLECTIVE ACTIONS. AND STUDENT OUTCOMES THEY NEED TO HEAR FROM THE STUDENTS MEAN THE TEACHERS ABOUT THE STUDENTS LEARNING THEIR PROGRESS THEIR STRUGGLES AND THEIR MOTIVATION TO KEEP LEARNING. TEACHERS NEED TO EXAMINE STUDENT ARTIFACTS SUCH AS ASSIGNMENTS TESTS PORTFOLIOS AND OTHER INDICATORS OFDAILY PROGRESS WITH ALL THESE ACTIVITIES THE KEY IS MAKING THE LINK BETWEEN THE TEACHERS ACTIONS. AND THE STUDENTS OUTCOMES EXPLICIT SO THE TEACHERS UNDERSTAND THAT THE FACTORS BEHIND STUDENT PROGRESS ARE WITHIN THEIR COLLECTIVE SPHERE OF INFLUENCE. HOW DOES RESEARCH IMPLIES THAT THIS THIS HEARING TODAY THAT IF THE ASPECT ASSESSMENTS DO NOT HELP EDUCATORS MAKE A LINK BETWEEN THEIR COLLECTIVE CLASSROOM ACTIONS. AND STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES THINK TEACHERS WILL NOT KNOW HOW TO ADJUST THEIR TEACHING PRACTICES IN A WAY THAT LEADS TO MODIFIED OR TEACHER ACTIONS TO EXPLICITLY IMPROVE STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES. WHILE SOME OF ASSESSMENTS ARE REQUIRED UNDER ASSET AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER THIS SOME ASSESSMENTS FALL SHORT OF PROVIDING TEACHERS WITH MEANINGFUL ARTIFACTS TO JUST CLASSROOM PRACTICE. NO MORE RECENTLY AS IT'S BEEN REFERENCE THE S. BACKED INTERIM ASSESSMENTS HAVE EXPANDED TO ALLOW TEACHERS MORE FOR. ASSESSMENTS AND ALLOW TEACHERS WHICH IS IMPORTANT TO YOU ITEM ANALYSIS BY STUDENT NAME. WHILE THE ASPECT INTERMENT ASSESSMENTS ARE INTENDED TO LEAD TO IMPROVE TEACHER COLLECTED ADVOCACY. ELEAZAR ARE STRUGGLING TO EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENT THE ENORMOUS ESTIMATES DO THE FACT THAT THE ASSESSMENTS AND TOOLS ON THEIR OWN ARE NOT INTUITIVE. TO HELLO. ACCESS THE ONLINE SO. VIEW STUDENTS RESULTS AND LEARNING HOW TO ANALYZE OUTCOMES USING THE ONLINE PORTABLES. WITH THESE BARRIERS THESE ARE THESE BERRIES ARE NOT INSURMOUNTABLE BUT THE REQUIRED DEDICATED STAFF PAID STAFF TO MANAGE THE ONLINE REPORTING SYSTEM IN ORDER TO GENERATE REPORTS AND REQUIRE THE TEACHERS ARE PROVIDED WITH TIME TO ANALYZE AND DISCUSS THE RESULTS. NOW BEFORE I CAME I MAY TRY SURVEYED OUR OUR TEACHERS AND THEY PROVIDED ANECDOTAL INFORMATION BOX ME THEY REALLY DO WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND AS EFERENCED EARLIER THE CALIFORNIA JOSH FOR THE HIGH SCHOOL SECOND- LEVEL. USES THAT'S BACK RESULTS IN THREE PLACES ENGLISH MATH AND ON THE CCI INDICATOR THEY REALLY WANTED TO THE RIGHT THING AND THEY'RE FEELING THAT THE PORTAL ITSELF THE ABILITY TO ACCESS AND GET REAL TIME. INFORMATION IS A CHALLENGE SO IF THE INTERIM ASSESSMENT DATA IS NOT TIMELY ACTIONABLE AND INFORMATIVE TO TEACHERS THERE WILL BE VERY LITTLE CHANGE IN CLASS FROM PRACTICES. TEACHERS NEED ACTIONABLE DATA THAT ALLOWS HIM TO BETTER ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS. DID THE STUDENTS GAIN ESSENTIAL UNDERSTANDING SKILLS HOW DO WE KNOW HOWCAN WE USE EVIDENCE OF STUDENT LEARNING TO IMPROVE CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION. PRINCE AND OTHER SCHOOL INSTRUCTIONAL MUST ALSO RECEIVED TRAINING ON PROFESSIONAL DEL DEVELOPMENT ON THE COLLECTIVE ELLAGIC EFFICACY POTENTIAL. OF THE ENORMOUS ESTIMATES TO DATE MANY ALWAYS INCLUDING MY OWN. HAVE STRUGGLED TO PROVIDE SUCH TIME THE ACTUAL FEEDBACK USING THE INTERIM ASSESSMENTS. THEREFORE THE TOOLS PROVIDED BY THE STATE pGOAL FOR OUTCOME. THE THEME OF TODAY'S HEARING THIS CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT THEREFORE THE QUESTION IS HOW CAN WE AS A CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. IMPLEMENTED ASSESSMENT MODEL THAT IS VALUED AND EMBRACED BY TEACHERS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES TEACHERS WITH DATA THAT LINK STUDENT LEARNING TO THE EXPECTED CLASSROOM LEARNING EXPECTATIONS. SOME OF THOSE SUCH AS I PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED ESTABLISH THE BAR FOR LEARNING FOR BY GRADE LEVEL BUT SUMMIT ASSESSMENTS DO NOT EXPLAIN HOW EVERY STUDENT IS EXPECTED TO CLEAR THE BAR. ASSUMING WE ALL AGREE. THAT ASKED THAT THE ASPECT ASSESSMENTS MEASURE WHAT WE WANT THE STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO KNOWING DO FOR ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS AND MATHEMATICS. I FEEL WE NEED TO SHIFT THE CONVERSATION TO HOW TEACHERS COLLECTIVELY IMPACTS STUDENT LEARNING TO MEET THE AGREED UPON LEARNING TARGETS. AS STATES TO UNDERSTAND COLLECTIVE IMPACT TEAMS OF TEACHERS NEED DETERMINE IF USING CLASSROOMS. POSITIVELY IN STOOD OUTCOMES. EXAMINING SPECIFIC EVIDENCE OF STUDENT LEARNING. OUR ASSESSMENT SYSTEM SHOULD MATTER MATTER WHAT WE WANT STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO GO INTO AND PROVIDE AN ANSWER RUNNING SO TEACHERS REFLECT THEIR TALK. TO IMPA STUDENT LEARNING. I LOOK FOR A DANCE YOUR RECKON PROVIDE GREAT SERVICE CITY AND CONCRETE EXAMPLES GREAT THE IT WAS CSUS. BUT HONESTLY I THINK YOU MISTER EITHER MISTER LAW ACTUALLY THE SAME THING HE JUST SAID IT IN DIFFERENT WAYS I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT THE YOU USED TEACHER SPEAK YEARS ADMINISTRATIVE SPEAK- BUT- I MEAN THAT THAT'S WHAT I HEARD ACTUALLY I THINK YOU GOT IT. ALLUDED TO WHAT I'M ALLUDING TO WE NEED MORE FEEDBACK ON A MORE IMMEDIATE BASIS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR NOT JUST AT THE END OF THE YEAR THAT SUMMIT TO PREVENT AGAIN- AND HOW DO WE DO THAT. RIGHT I THINK THAT'S A REAL NEXT QUESTION FOR THE S. BACK ASSESSMENT SYSTEM OR- BECAUSE I WANT TO BE AN ASSESSMENT SYSTEM NOT A TESTING SYSTEM. AS WE AS WE MENTION. BUT I THINK IT IS THE HIGHLIGHT HERE THAT IN TERMS ARE NOT FORMATIVE. IN TERM AS A CHUNK OF TIME. A FORMATIVE CAN BE ON A SPECIFIC STANDARD. THE MEASURE OF THE COMMITTEE KNOWS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THE RIGHT NOW BUT I HOPE THEY DO- BUT A BIT AGAIN FORMERS IS MORE IMMEDIATE IT'S MORE IMMEDIATE FEEDBACK. IT COULD BE ON A DAILY BASIS COULD BE I MET A TEN MINUTE BASIS RIGHT. ARE THEY ARE ARE THEY ARE THE MASTERING. THE MATERIAL AND THEN YOU TALKED ABOUT ANALYZING THE DATA THAT'S BECOME VERY DIFFICULT TO HEAR THIS YOU HAVE TO GO TO FOUR SITES APPARENTLY. IT WE NEED TO FIX THAT. HERE'S DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO TO FOUR SIDES. YOU KNOW WHAT FIVE CLASSES IN HIGH SCHOOL MAYBE MAYBE SIX CLASSES THAT'S- CLOSE TO TWO HUNDRED STUDENTS. HEY UNIFOR WEBSITES FOR STUDENTS. RIGHT NOT PRACTICAL. SO WE NEED TO FIX THAT- AND MAYBE IF SOMEONE FROM THE S. BACK COULD COME UP AT ADDRESS THAT IN A MINUTE AND A MINUTE- BUT AGAIN IT WHAT WHAT. WHAT I'VE ALSO SEEN A LAST TIME WE HAD THIS YEAR'S COUPLE YEARS AGO ACTUALLY OF NONPROFITS AND ACTUALLY FOR PROFIT COMPANIES COME UP. R THEY'VE ACTUALLY CREE. A DEVICE OUTSIDE OF THE US BACK. THAT IS MORE INTERIM OR MORE MORE FORMATIVE IN NATURE. AND THAT THAT SOME DISTRICTS WERE BUYING THAT WILL THEY HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER PRODUCT TO FIGURE OUT. HOW THEY BEST MEET THE NEEDS. ARE THERE ARE THE DEMANDS OF THE ASPECTS SYSTEM SO THAT SHOULD ALL BE BUILT INTO THE ASPECT THAT WHOLE SYSTEM SHOULD BE BUILT ON THE S. BACK. AND THAT'S A FAILURE A LITTLE BIT FROM YOU KNOW FROM SACRAMENTO. MAJOR DISCONNECT- FROM THIS DíAS AND CLASSROOM THAT'S WHY I'M GLAD YOU'RE GIVING US. THAT FEEDBACK AND I'VE- THE BILL OF THE PAST MCCARTY PUSH THIS YEAR WHAT. THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL SPECIFICALLY AND IT WAS. CONTROVERSIAL AND THAT WAS TO ALLOW THE ACT OR SAT. TO REPLACE THE US BACK AND THAT'LL EMIGRATE YOUR BUT WHY MY MAJOR SUPER DOES HAVE THEIR OWN REASONS RIGHT THEY HAVE THEIR OWN REASONS WHY THEY WANT THEY WANT MORE KIDS IN A COLLEGE SALIVA. MY MAIN REASON WAS BECAUSE IT WAS MORE OF A FORMER TO PRODUCT. HE GIVE THE PSA T. THE PAC T. AND THAT NINETY. EIGHTH SOMETIME EIGHT NINE. TENTH AND ELEVENTH GRADE NINTH TENTH. EIGHT NINETY TENTH YOU'RE SO YOU CAN IDENTIFY THE ACHIEVING GAPS THAT CLOSE AND THAT'S REALLY. WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW DO WE- CLOSE THIS ACHIEVEMENT GAPS HOW WE ENSURE. MASTERY OF STANDARDS. AGAIN I APPRECIATE THAT YOU BOTH CAME OUT OF FROM A DIFFERENT. PERSPECTIVE IT'S OBVIOUS SOMETIMES AS A AS A CLASSROOM TEACHER I'M WONDERING WHAT THEY WANT. ON THE S. BACK. WHAT DO THEY WANT. BECAUSE THE QUESTIONS THEY DON'T COME THROUGH SOME BLOOM'S TAXONOMY TYPE APPROACH FRIDAY JUST SEEM LIKE THEY'RE FROM LEFT FIELD SOMEONE WROTE IT UP THIS WAY. AND I DON'T CHEN ANY OF YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON ANYTHING I SAID. ANY ANY FURTHER THOUGHTS. WHAT I WILL I WILL TELL YOU CHAIRMAN I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH WHAT YOU'VE SAID IN TERMS OF THE FRUSTRATIONS WITH THE WITH THE ASSESSMENT AND FOR AND IN THE TRENCHES THAT QUESTION WHAT IS IT THEY WANT AND THEN WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO WITH THAT. WITH THAT INFORMATION- ARE THE TWO BIGGEST CONCERNS WE NEED TIME TO FIGURE THOSE THINGS OUT AND HOPEFULLY WITH THE NEW WEB SITES WILL BE ABLE TO I WILL SAY ONE LAST THING THOUGH WE ARE LUCKY AT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL TO HAVE STUDENTS WHO ARE SOMEWHAT MORE FLUENT WITH USING THE COMPUTER BUT THE DIGITAL NATIVES YOU HEARD OF- IN PANEL ONE- MY SON IS ONE OF THOSE HE WAS IN KINDERGARTEN THE FIRST YEAR CONCORD ROLLED OUT HE'S ELEVEN HE'S IN THE SIXTH GRADE. HE HAS FIVE SIX AND SET OF FRIENDS WHO WOULD KNOW HOW TO. USE A COMPUTER FOR A TEST LIKE THIS SO GOD BLESS YOU IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DEALING WITH. A COMPUTER IT'S ACTED WELL TOO BECAUSE A LOT OF THE IPAD IN THAT RIGHT. TO KEYBOARDS GONE FOR THE LITTLE ONES ARE AT. SOME OF THE PAST OKAY THANK YOU. AND THEN I TOOK TO OUR TO OUR PREVIOUS PANEL THANK YOU AGAIN- AND MAYBE ONE OF YOU COULD RESPOND TO THIS A FIRST OF ALL YOU STATED THAT A NINE YEAR OLD HAS A TWENTY SEVEN A FORTY FIVE MINUTE. ATTENTION SPAN IS VERY INTERESTING. MUCH LONGER THAN SOME LEGISLATORS I KNOW. BUT I WILL SAY THIS IS UNIQUE I GOT IT I GOT YOU LET ME GIVE KUDOS TO MY COLLEAGUES HERE. WHO HAVE SAT THROUGH THIS. BECAUSE I THINK IF YOU YOU KNOW MAYBE IF YOU HAVEN'T DONE THIS TOO MUCH YOU WONDER WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT. AND I UNDERSTAND THIS I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAT THROUGH THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS A- A VERY BIG CONVERSATION HAVE BECAUSE IF. YOU KNOW IT IS A HIGH STAKES TEST WHETHER WE WANT TO BE OR NOT IT IS. AND SO WE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET IT RIGHT I THINK THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT GETTING IT RIGHT- SO WITH THAT AND- WHICH YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT- SUMMARIZING THE INFORMATION YOU. I DON'T I TALK ABOUT ACCESSING FOR WEBSITES- DO YOU FIND IT. LET ME THROW QUESTION DO YOU FIND IT DIFFICULT. TO CALL THE DATA INTO ONE SPOT SO YOU CAN IDENTIFY THE IT WOULD. HOW STUDENTS ARE ACHIEVING. AND I TALK ABOUT SORTING OUT THE DATA IN THE INTERIM ACCESS DID YOU. COULD YOU LOOT ON THAT. I TOOK SIR THAT OUT WE HAVE- AGAIN HI SO DISTRICT WE'RE WE'RE FOLKSINGERS MATHEMATICS AND SO AS THE PORTALS KEEP EVOLVING AND CHANGING I GUESS WE WANT TO BE DO IF WE WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING SO WE'VE WE HAVE TO TRY TO CREATE THIS BACKWARDS MAPPING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT MODEL SO YOU'RE THE SECOND REASON OF A CONTRACT WITH THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION I HAVE TO HIRE STAFF TO COME OUT TO OUR HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT I HAVE TO TRAIN THE TEACHERS WE TRY TO DO A TRAIN THE TRAINER MODEL SO THEY CAN JUST BASICALLY UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE THE PLATFORM. THEN YOU HAVE TO TAKE THAT INFORMATION IDENTIFY I TIME WITHIN THE PROFESSIONAL YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE REALLY REALLY SOME OF YOUR PROFESSIONAL LEARNING COMMUNITIES TO THEN TRY TO UNPACK- HOW TO GET CAUGHT UP TO ANALYZE IT AND USE IT AND THEN THE PORTAL ALTHOUGH IT'S IMPROVING HAS CHANGED AND SO THEN THE TEACHERS THIS YEAR WHO HAD BEEN TRAINED IN A PARTICULAR WAY OF DOING IT HOW DID WHEN THE PROCESS OF RETRAINING THEM AND SO I JUST DON'T WANNA THERE'S- THERE ARE COSTS AND EFFORTS AROUND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TO ACCESS THIS INFORMATION AND IT'S IT IS A REAL BARRIER SO IT'LL- TRYING TO GET IN. CAUSES LOS UP OUR STUDENTS ARE NOT LEARNING NOT MEETING THE STANDARDS EVEN THOUGH THE TOOLS ARE IMPROVED I'M NOT DENYING THAT THERE ARE LINE I'VE BEEN SYSTEM WORST STRUGGLE THING OUR TEACHERS. MEETING WAIT THAT ONE TIME IN OUR- SO THEY CAN. HAVING QUESTIONS ABOUT DO WE TO. THESE ON THAT. TEACH SPENCER A WAY THAT STUDENTS ABLE TO PASS THIS EXAM WHAT. LET ME LET ME. LET ME PROJECT ON THAT SO IT'S TWENTY. SHE THE ABLE TO HIT A BUTTON. HAVE THEY INFORMATION. WELL BECAUSE THE INFORMATION AND MY OPINION A MALE THAT OTHER CONSORTIUM SPEAK TO THAT THE INFORMATION IS PROPRIETARY SO MUCH IN OUR OWN LIVES I THINK WE HAVE USERNAME AND PASSWORD FATIGUE. AND EVERYTHING THAT WE SUBSCRIBE TO. SERVE BECAUSE THIS PROPRIETARY INFORMATION YOU HAVE TO HAVE A DESIGNATED PERSON FIRST OF ALL I'D- JENNIFER WHO HAS ACCESS. TO THE INFORMATION AND AT WHAT LEVEL THAT ACCESS THE INFORMATION. THEN YOU HAVE TO HAVE STAFF PREPARED TO CREATE GROUPS BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY ONE WOULD LOOK AT GROUPS OF STUDENTS AND DO THIS ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS. YOU FIRST THEN HAVE TO ASK THE TEACHERS WHAT'S UP A GROUP THAT YOU WANT. AND THEN SOMEBODY CENTRALIZED LOCATION HOUSE AND THEN GENERATE THOSE GROUPS AND THEN ONCE THOSE GROUPS ARE CREATED YOU HAVE TO IDENTIFY TEACHER LEADER OR COULD BE A TOW SO. SHE TRANSNATIONAL SIMON TO THEN GO OUT AND FACILITATE THE DISCUSSIONS. I JUST IT'S NOT AS EASY AS WE JUST MADE IT AVAILABLE AND THEN YOU'RE ABLE TO MAKE SENSE OF THE INFORMATION. THERE'S THERE NEEDS TO BE LEADERSHIP IN ORGANIZATION ABOUT WE'RE NOT LIKE WILL SHOULD BE THAT EASY- I WOULD ARGUE THAT THAT IT THAT IT SHOULD BE THAT EASY BUT I'D- IF YOU KEEP. THE GOOD LIKE THE ONE WEEK WHY ARE WE IN A CONSORTIUM THAT WE WERE PART OF THIS. YOU KNOW BODY THIS GOVERNMENTAL BODY WHERE WERE YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER THE WIRING A CONSORTIUM WE CAN'T ACCESS THIS INFORMATION WILL NOT ONLY THAT. THERE'S A HUNDRED ANDEIGHTY AS WELL I'M HOLDING UP THIS IS THE MEASURE THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL NUMBER OF A SET IN ASSESSMENTS THAT AVAILABLE FOR MATHEMATICS AND IT'S HARD TO SEE BUT- THERE'S A HUNDRED EIGHTY SCHOOL DAYS IN A GIVEN YEAR. SO THEY ALSO BECOMES QUESTION FROM THE GO SUPPORT PEDAGOGICAL PERSPECTIVE. HOW MANY DAYS OF THE HUNDRED EIGHTY THAT WE-WE GONNA COMMIT. TO PROCTOR IN THESE. THESE EXACT. INSTEAD OF GETTING OFF SUBJECT INSTEAD OF ALLOWING THE TEACHERS. TO TEACH THE- OKAY BORDER. TOWN THE IT I DON'T. THINK WHAT WHAT IS IT THAT WE ARE. DURING WHAT IS WHICH TO CALL WHAT IS THE WE WANT STUDENTS TO WHAT. AND WE GOT TO. AND THEN. AND IF I CAN. HAVE THE- IT IS SUBSTANTIAL AND AN EX IT ALTHOUGH IS A GOOD THING IT ALLOWS TEACHERS RIGHT SPECIFIC THINGS WANT TO LOOK AT BUT IT BUT IT THERE A LOT HERE SO AND- MISS HOMES. WELL THAT REALLY. AND ABSOLUTELY I MEAN IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO USE THE INFORMATION TO ACCESS THE INFORMATION TO MAKE IT USER FRIENDLY FOR TEACHERS TO MAKE SENSE OF IT AND THIS IS THE INTERIM YES. UNDER RIGHT AND IN YOU POINTED OUT IN TERM DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN FORMATIVE A FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT SHOULD INFORM IT'S IN THE ROOT OF THE WORD IT SHOULD INFORM INSTRUCTION AND IT'S JUST NOT DOING THAT AT THIS POINT LEAST THAT'S THE FEEDBACK THAT WE'RE GETTING IN OUR DISTRICT AND FROM DIFFERENT SITES DIFFERENT TACK GRADE LEVELS THAT WHAT IS BECOMING MORE PRONOUNCED IS THAT WHEN YOU FINALLY GET TO OKAY THIS MANY KIDS MISS THIS QUESTION WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE QUESTION OR IS TO THE CHILDREN TRULY UNDERSTAND THE CONTENT OR DO THEY UNDER. NOT UNDERSTAND THE WAY THE QUESTION WAS ASKED AND THAT'S A DIFFERENT QUESTION I MEAN WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON MAKING SURE CHILDREN UNDERSTAND THE STANDARDS WE SHOULD MAKE BE MAKING SURE THAT- OUR TEACHERS ARE EMPOWERED WITH HIGH QUALITY INSTRUCTION TO ENSURE THAT THEY MEET THE STANDARDS WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THE STANDARDS IS A FLOOR NOT THIS THE CEILING. AND INSTEAD FOCUS NOW IS GOING TO THE LÏNG THE TASK IS HOW YOU TO MAKE SURE A PASS THIS QUESTION TO. AND I THINK SOMETHING THAT. WE'RE MISSING THE POINT THERE. OKAY SO SUIT HELL HELPS LEAD QUESTION HOW LONG HOW MANY DAYS A YEAR DOES IT TAKE YOU TO ADMINISTER THE TEST. WILD THAT. WE CAN IN. TWO WEEKS WE SPENT TWO WEEKS AMEND DAYS TEN SCHOOL THAT. OF THE YEAR YEAH TEN DAYS AT THE END OF THE YEAR AND THAT'S THE OTHER THING TO IMAGINE PERCENT OF YOUR YEAR WELL AND ON TOP OF YOU MENTIONED BEFORE. AT THE YOU KNOW IF IN TERMS TO THEN ADD THAT ON THAT SPENDING A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF YOUR TESTING ON TOP OF DISTRICTS THAT THEIR OWN ASSESSMENTS HEATED TO WHICH IS A PROBLEM THAT I KNOW THAT'S OUTSIDE OF THE REALM. I'VE GOT A LOADED QUESTION FOR YOU. ARE YOU'RE DISTRICTS ASSESSMENTS MORE INFORMATIVE TO YOUR TEACHERS. THEN THE ASPECT. WELL YES ABSOLUTELY. YEAH ABSOLUTELY DO THEY COMPORT WITH THE ASPECT YES MA'AM. WHAT YOU'VE DONE AND IN IT INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR SOME PRODUCT THROUGH US BACK IF HE'S CREATED YOUR OWN FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE DID PROBLEM I HAVE WITH A CHALLENGE I HAVE WITH AS THAT MEANS THERE'S ONE THOUSAND pACCOUNTING DIFFERENCE AFTER SPENDING TIME CREATING THEIR OWN ASSESSMENTS NOTHING WE SPENT ABOUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS ON THAT ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO. DOING THAT I THINK THEY WERE GOING PLAN BECAUSE THE S. AND FULLY DEVELOPED HAD GONE ONLINE AND USE IT WE'RE GETTING READY FOR IT I WAS ONE OF THEM. RIGHT ALL THEY THAT WHEN TEACHERS CREATE ON ASSESSMENTS THE LEVEL OF LEARNING FOR TEACHERS GOES WAY WAY UP. RIGHT NOW. THEY HAVE TO DECIDE HOW MUCH FAITH. THEY'RE PUTTING IN ON AS BACK AND THE ITEMS THE TEST ITEMS IN THIS BACK. WHEN TEACHERS KNOWLEDGE IS NOT THAT HIGH THEY'RE GOING TO THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT MOST TEACHERS DO THEY TEACH TO THE TEST THEY- AND SO. WHAT WE BEHOLDING TO WE'RE BEHOLDING TO THE TEST FOR SURE BUT WE'RE ALSO HOLDING TO OUR KIDS IN THE NEXT GRADE LEVEL RUSSELL BEHOLDING TO THOSE KIDS WHEN THEY GET TO MIDDLE SCHOOL. WERE ALSO THE WHOLE TO GET THESE KIDS READY FOR HIGH SCHOOL AND WE'RE ALSO HOLDING. FOR THESE KIDS TO BE ABLE TO BE ADULTS AND BE ABLE TO MOVE THROUGH A MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY. SO WHEN TEACHER KNOWLEDGE COMES UP WHEN THEY'RE CREATING THEY'VE THEY'VE THEY'VE TO PROFESSIONALS ON WE DO IS A LOT AROUND EIGHT. HOW CAN WE MEASURE. WHAT WE WANT TO GET TO KNOW NOW WEEK WE GO FROM THE STANDARDS OF COMP COMMON CORE STAND AS WE LOOK AT IT ME. WE MEASURE ALL THE TIME. THAT'S PROGRESSION OVER TIME. SO THANK YOU. ANY OTHER OF. ANY OTHER THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. DOCTOR WEBER. YES THE THANK YOU AB BOTH FOR BOTH PANELS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE INFORMATION THAT YOU'VE GIVEN US OBVIOUSLY YOU'VE DONE QUITE A BIT OF THINKING ABOUT THE SUBJECT ITSELF- I PROBABLY I THINK I WAS PROBABLY THE ONLY ONE ON THE IN THE ASSEMBLY WHEN WE DID THIS WHEN WE STARTED THIS SO SMART BALANCE AND- WE PUT IN TWO BILLION DOLLARS SO I REMEMBER- AT THE- EDUCATION OMMITTEE TO BASICALLY GET TO ADDRESS. PARTICULAR ISSUE I'M WONDERING THAT WE WAIT A TWO BILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE THE QUESTIONS THAT I'M HEARING IN THE MEN'S- DON'T SEEM LIKE WE MOVED VERY FAR- WE SEEM TO BE SAYING BUT WE WERE OF WHAT IS WAS IN TWENTY THIRTEEN- WHEN WE PUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS HE SAID IF IT FILE THE SMART OF BALANCE OR IS. COMMON CORE WAS TO BE A- IT'S GOING TO BE. SOME OUT OF THE AFTER LIMITED TRAINING. REMEMBER THE AND WE GAVE TO BILLION INTO THE BUDGET THE- YEAR CARING WHAT THIS. YEAR WE PUT IN BUT WE PUT A LOT OF MONEY. INTO OF STAFF DEVELOPMENT TRAINING THOSE KINDS OF THINGS- WE'VE BEEN MENTIONED THE NEED FOR THE- UNIVERSITIES TO- CHANGE THEIR TEACHER TRAINING. EDUCATION PROGRAM SO THAT WE WOULDN'T FOR BE FOREVER. IN THIS MODE THE WE'RE IN NOW TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THERE HOW TO. HELP KIDS TO SUCCEED. AND WHETHER NOT ARE MET THAT AND ARE THINGS THAT WE'RE USING TO ACCOMPLISH THE GOALS THAT WITH THE EYES YOU MENTION WE SET THE STATE ANOTHER QUESTION IS HOW DO WE GET THE KIDS TO THE STANDARD. AND WHICH BECOMES THE REAL CHALLENGE WHICH IS REALLY THE TEACHING THAT OCCURS MUCH MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. AND THAT HAS BECOME OBVIOUS THE SHOP AND I'M- I'M I'M I'M HAPPY THAT I'M THE FOLKS. AT YEAH THAT'S A REAL CHALLENGE IS REALLY NOT SO MUCH. A DEFINED UNDER ITS AND WHAT HAVE WE DONE AND I KNOW ONE. THING WE WHAT WE WANT EVERYONE ALL THE THINGS. HOW GET KIDS THERE AND ONE OF THE. WE NEED TO. THE STAFF THE ELEMENTARY FOR TO HELP THEM GET THE BECAUSE THEY IS A NEW WAY OF IS AN METHOD THIS A NEW THAT WOULD LOOK FOR AND OF WHAT WEEKS FROM I PEOPLE'S A PART OF THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE STAFF DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING SO I'M NOT SURE IF WE'VE DONE ENOUGH OF THAT- I'M NOT SURE WHERE OUR UNIVERSITIES ARE BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE GENERAL THINKING IS THAT THEY'RE THE ONES TRAINING OUR TEACHERS EIGHTY SOME PERCENT OF ALL OF OUR TEACHERS COME FROM THE C. ISSUE SYSTEM. SO WHETHER NOT ART TEACHER IT PROGRAMS HAVE ADAPTED TO IT I'M NOT REALLY SURE OF I KNOW WHEN I WAS AT THE UNIVERSITY I DON'T I DON'T SEE THE UNIVERSE IS RESPONDING A LOT TO OUR STUFF ME THEY DO IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY RIGHT NOT NECESSARILY IN HOW THEY HANDLED THIS TO TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT SEEM TO BE THAT. BEN FOR LAST EIGHTEEN YEARS SO THIS A REAL CHANCE AT MY OTHER FIRST RATE COMES IN THE FACT THAT. WE'VE DONE A LITTLE TO LOOK AT THE SYSTEM AND EXIST BECAUSE MOST OF OUR CHALLENGES K. TWELVE. I MEAN CASE SIX K. SEVEN. BECAUSE IF YOU GET A- FUNCTIONING AND DOING WHAT YOU WANT IN THE FIRST FIVE OR SIX YEARS. IS TO HELP YOU KNOW I'S A SLIDE DOWN HILL PRETTY MUCH BECAUSE- AT THAT POINT IS REALLY JUST A SIMPLE YOU. BASICALLY OVERLAYING THIS CONTENT OVER THE SKILLS THAT THE KIDS HAVE DEVELOPED IN TERMS OF. HOW THEY THINK AND WHAT THEY SEE. SO I BIG FAILURE LIES IN K. FIVE. YEAH AND THEN IT JUST MULTIPLIES AFTER THAT IF YOU DON'T GET IT DONE. SO I'M NOT SURE WHETHER WHAT WHAT WE'VE DONE IN TERMS OF. ENSURING THAT THAT FIRST FIVE OR SIX YEARS MAKES A DIFFERENCE AND IT SHOULD BE MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF WHAT WE SEE WHAT WE WANT. AND WHAT THE NOT DONE THE NECESSARY STAFF DEVELOPMENT. TRAINING BUT IT IS. IT IS IMPORTANT WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT WE CAN WE CAN DEVELOP WE CAN. ADAPT ALL THE STUFF THAT WE GET WE CAN CHANGE THIS THAT AND THE OTHER. BUT IF WE DON'T. YOU OUT KEY THE TERM. ON THE- KING AT KIDS WHOSE. WHO WOULD 2020% TALLER PERFORMANCE WHICH BECOMES ARE. A REAL CHALLENGE TO SEE WHETHER NOT EVERYBODY'S GETTING THIS CURRICULUM- THAT BECOMES A MAJOR CHALLENGE THAT SO THEY ARE YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU TURN THOSE KIDS ON. OW DO YOU HELP THOSE TEACHERS UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY NEED TO DO. TO RELATE TO THOSE STUDENTS. TO MOTIVATE THEM TO ACCEPT THE TO BASICALLY MEET THOSE CHALLENGES AND THAT IT THERE. AND WE CAN'T WAIT TO THE END OF THE YEAR. YEAH ON. TO YOU GO THROUGH THIS I'M HAVE BEEN IN CLASSROOMS WHERE. TEACHERS ARE VERY SUCCESSFUL IN DOING THIS AND THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT DOING AS MUCH OF THE- MENTAL AT. OF GYMNASTICS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY HAVE TO LOOK UP EVERY TEST SCHOOL WE HAVE TO FIND. THE NAME OF THE PERSON. FIND AT EVERY LITTLE. THERE THEY SOMEHOW ANOTHER FROM HOME. IN OTHER THINGS THAT ARE GETTING. IN THIS. BEGIN POST. WHETHER THE KEY IS GET. THIS OF. THINKING THAT ARE. SO I THINK. WHAT WE TO PUT. BECAUSE ALL. ALL OF. HIM TO BOOK. AND YOU BEGIN TO DO IT AND THEN YOU START QUESTIONING YOURSELF. AND EVERYTHING YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE COMPUTER. AND FIND IT IF IT'S REALLY REALLY RIGHT. IT IS TAKE YOUR LIFETIME AND YOU WON'T GET VERY FAR BECAUSE YOU BEGIN TO RELY UPON THAT RATHER THAN WHAT YOU KNOW. AND HOW TO ASSESS WHAT'S GOING ON SO. SO I YOU KNOW I BECOME FRUSTRATED BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME FOLKS WHO. WHO REALLY KNOW THIS STUFF. WHO REALLY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SOME EXAMPLES OF SOME SCHOOLS WHO REALLY ARE SUCCESSFUL. I WAS READING ONE IN SAN FRANCISCO YOU PROBABLY HEARD THE ONE IN SAN FRANCISCO WITH THESE KIDS. IN MATH I JUST BLOWING THE TOPS OFF. SO THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES. YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THEY DOING. AND WHAT WE READ IN THE COMPUTER PRINTOUT. VERSUS LOOKING AT THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SUCCESSFUL. YOU KNOW WE FIND THAT TO BE TRUE A LOT IN THE FOURTEEN SCHOOLS AROUND HERE WITH THESE KIDS IS BLOWING THE TOP OFF OF THE MAP. AND SO. LOOKING AT WHAT WHAT'S WRONG WITH THESE. NORMALLY BE FAIL BUT ARE NOT. YOU KNOW. AND FIGURE NOT BECAUSE WE SET THE STANDARD WE'VE GOT THE MATERIAL WE WANT THEM TO LEARN. BUT WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO YOU RELATE TO THE STUDENTS HOW DO YOU MOTIVATE THE STUDENTS TO LEARN. HOW DO YOU GET THE MOVIE. IN AND THAT'S THAT THAT IN ITSELF IS THE ART OF TEACHING. AND SO I DON'T WANT TO BE VALUE WHAT I. CHOOSE HAVE. AS THE DATA WELL THE TO HOPEFULLY LOOK INTO AND FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON WELL WE SEEM TO READ AMOUNT OF STUDIES. I MEAN I THINK THOSE THINGS ARE IMPORTANT IF YOU GET TO A POINT WE RUNS A WALL AND YOU JUST CAN'T. SEEM TO MOVE IT YOU WANT TO FIGURE. IT IS. BUT OFTENTIMES WEEDS SECOND GUESS OUR FOLKS ABILITY TO DO IT. AND AS A RESULT WE COMPLICATE TEACHING. SO A BIG. A BY IN SOME. AND ONE TEACHING BECOMES ROLLED. IT IS D. IS GOING TO DIP KIDS COME WITH ABILITY. MAY LOSE THIS PAST IN THIS DESIGN. AND IT'S AND IT'S A BIT KEY TO GET. ON BECAUSE KID'S. HAS COME. TO THE SUBJECT MATTER. SO I'M- HOPING THAT. THAT ALL OF THE- BILL IN THE DOT. WE SPENT WE HAVE DONE THE- THAT WOULD THAT THIS. SUPPORTED WITH. WE REALLY SUPPORTS US IN IN THE IN A WAY BUT DOES NOT TAKE AWAY. THE HUMAN ELEMENT OF TEACHING. THAT THIS IS A PASSION THAT THE THAT YOU CAN REACH THESE KIDS AND THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE. AND THAT WE BEGIN TO LOOK AROUND BECAUSE LIKE I SAY EERY NOW AND THEN I RUN ACROSS. SOMEONE WHO'S DONE IT YEAH THE WHOLE SCHOOL LIKE IN SAN FRANCISCO AND I'M DETERMINED TO GET THERE TO SEE THE SCHOOL. WHERE THEY JUST BLOWN THE STOCKS OFFER MET. IN THIS IN THIS POOR NEIGHBORHOOD OF KIDS NORMALLY. BE AND- WE TO FIGURE THAT OUT AND LET THAT MOTIVATES SOMETIMES OUR TEACHERS AND OUR PRINCIPLES TO. TO DO SOME THINGS OR SOME OF THESE INSTITUTES THAT LIKE JOE JOHNSON OTHERS ONE WHICH REALLY FOCUSON UNDERPERFORMING SCHOOLS. AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THESE FOLKS ARE DOING. AND DO THAT BECAUSE- WE'VE ALREADY SPENT WHAT IS A SIX SEVEN YEARS NOW WOULD SMARTER BALANCED AND COMMON CORE AND OTHER THAN THAT. AND BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND THAT'S OKAY I MEAN YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. STAFF DEVELOPMENT TRAINING. BUT AS I LISTEN TO THIS IT JUST SEEMS LIKE IT'S EXHAUSTING. OF YOU KNOW TO GO HOME TO GET IN THE CLASSROOM. I MEAN YOU KILL YOURSELF BRING THE STUFF ALL DAY LONG. AND THEN YOU AND THEN YOU REALIZE YOU SPENT DAYS. DOING THIS AND NOT DOING WHAT YOU KNOW SHE SHOULD. IN TERMS OF THE CLASSROOM SO. I HOPE WE COME IN. ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW BECAUSE. TEACHING IS A PASSION. YOU KNOW IN THOSE DO IT DO IT WELL. AND I'VE SEEN. WHO WANTED BECAUSE UP IN ALL THE OTHER STUFF. AND GET TO THE QUESTION OF. HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS KID PICKED UP THIS TOPIC HOW DO YOU KNOW THEY REALLY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. AND HOW AND YOUR ASSESSMENT AS A TEACHER. TO KNOW THAT THEY'VE THAT THEY'VE ACTUALLY MASTERED THIS. AND THAT YOU CAN LAYER IT AND BUILD ON SOMETHING ELSE IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT AND SELF. I DON'T KNOW I JUST GOT TIRED. OF BEING VERY EXHAUSTED AND I'VE TALKED TO FORTY YEARS AND I THOUGHT LORD BY TO DO ALL THAT. I'M NOT SURE AB ONE EVER TEACH THE CLASS. BUT WITHOUT THE PASSION. IN THE INNATE ABILITY OF A GOOD TEACHER TO FIGURE OUT WHEN THE BILL WHEN THE LIGHT GOES OFF. OKAY THANK YOU DOCTOR ROBERT I AGREE YOU CAN'T STANDARDIZED GOOD TEACHING. BECAUSE IT'S AN ART. AND EVERYBODY BRINGS YOUR SKILL SET AND THEIR PERSONALITY. TO MATCH THOSE. THAT EXIST IN ANY CLASS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE DO HAVE STANDARDIZED TEST. AND THAT'S THAT'S A CHANNEL HERE I. KNOW YOU. WE SHOULD GIVE US HOPE. THAT HER BRAG. AFTER SCHOOL AND- VERY DIVERSE SCHOOL AND IN PARTICULAR THEY ARE FOCUSED ON MATH AND IN PARTICULAR THEY DO A VERY GOOD JOB ON MASS SO GO AHEAD AND DO A TWO THREE MINUTE ADVERTISED. WE'D LIKE TO INVITE YOU TO OUR SCHOOLS COME JOIN US AND ASKING DIEGO. AND YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND THAT'S WHY A PART OF WHAT MIKE SAID WAS ARE WE ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTION. YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE DO KNOW THAT AND THE MOST IMPACTFUL- AND- MEASURE OF STUDENT SUCCESS IS THE INSTRUCTION AND HOW THE INSTRUCTIONS FORM BASED AND FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT. I KNOW THAT FROM THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SCHOOL LEADERSHIP- AND WE ARE AS A COUNTRY WE ARE EIGHT IN MATHEMATICS WHERE THIRTY SIX. THIRTY AND WE HAVE COVERAGE THERE FOR SINCE THE INCEPTION OF PIZZA. SO I WANT TO ADDRESS IS THE MATH REAL QUICK- YOU KNOW WHAT OF ONE OF MY MATH HERE SAID IT BEST. YOU KNOW. FIFTY BOB. HOW WE TEACH BUT IS COMPETE HOW WE NEED TO TEACH NOW. COMPETES WITH TWELVE SIX TWELVE YEARS OF LEARNING MATHEMATICS RIGHT AS LEARNERS OF MATHEMATICS AND AS TEACHERS HOW MANY YEARS ON TOP OF THAT WE HAVE BEEN TEACHING MATHEMATICS SO TO YOUR POINT IT DOES TAKE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND THERE WAS MONEY PUT TOWARDS PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT WHEN COMMON CORE. WAS IMPLEMENTED BUT IT WASN'T ENOUGH AND IT REALLY DOES TAKE CONTINUOUS PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ONGOING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE IT TAKES A LOT CHANGE THE WAY WE INSTRUCT I'M ALSO ACCORDING TO PEACE ABOUT 50% OF THE ADULTS COUNTRY DON'T BELIEVE THEY'RE GOOD AT MATH. AND ACTUALLY I'VE DONE THAT. CHECK THE CONSULTING FOR TO MALCOLM MY AS WELL AND WE'VE TALKED OVER THE- IN INTERNATIONALLY AS WELL. AND IN SACRAMENTO YES WE DID- AND THAT'S A TRUE STATISTICS AND IT'S OUR EXPERT IN ITS OUR EXPERIENCE AS WELL. AND WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO CHANGE THAT BUT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN THAT QUICKLY SO WANTED TO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I AM ABLE TO DO IT MY SCHOOL BECAUSE I'M A TITLE ONE SCHOOLS I DO HAVE FEDERAL MONEY AND THAT'S HOW I PAY FOR MIKE. BUT THAT'S YOU KNOW NOT EVERY SCHOOL PRIORITIZES THAT SO I'M NOT GETTING ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING I'M SEEN MY SITE FUNDS IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THAT BUT IT DOES TAKE A LOT IT TAKES A LOT OF. PERFECT DEVELOPMENT ON PRACTICE. DEVELOP TRULY UNDERSTAND WHAT KIDS KNOWING ASKING US FOR QUESTIONS WHAT DO WHAT DO THEY NEED TO LEARN. YOU KNOW HOW WE GOING TO MEASURE WHAT WE DO WHEN THEY'VE ALREADY LOOK AT WHAT WE DO WHEN THEY HAPPENED TO WE AND OUR TEACHER. NEED TO A QUICK. GIVE THEM AT SENATE BILL'S CASH. MAKE BEST INSTRUCTIONAL THE- BUT IF DON'T HAVE THE KIND AND PEDAGOGICAL KNOWLEDGE. TYPICAL TO MAKE THOSE TO. AND THEY TEND TO- DEFAULT TO WHAT EVER CURRICULUM THEY MIGHT HALF AND TRUST THAT MORE THAN TRUST THEIR ART OF TEACHING. AND THEIR AND THEIR EXPERTISE AS A TEACHER. THAT'S WHY I WANT TO HAVE EVERYONE OF OUR TEACHERS BE MATHEMATICS AND LITERACY EXPERTS. YOU KNOW THE INTERESTING THING WHEN WE DECIDED THAT- EVERYONE WAS GOING TO DO TAKE ALGEBRA IN SAN DIEGO UNIFIED WHEN I WAS ON THE SCHOOL BOARD- I HAD PARENTS. UPSET CALLING ME. BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT THE KIDS TO TAKE ALGEBRA. AND THEY ALWAYS SAY. ME YOU KNOW I MEAN I WAS NEVER GOOD AT MATH I MEAN YOU KNOW. AND I WOULD ALWAYS ASSN THE CRITICAL QUESTION DO YOU THINK IT. IS A TWO. AT SALEM. NOT AS A WITH THE DON'T. KIDS THAT. BECAUSE MOST. TO DON'T WELL IN MATH KIDS. DO WELL IN MATH BECAUSE THEY'VE ALREADY. THIS THAT IF THEY DO GIVE US OR DO YOU. OKAY BECAUSE THEY DID GET. IT WELL. SO WE DO THINK. MATH COMES. SO I. BE THAT SOME PEOPLE DO SOME PEOPLE DON'T THAT'S THEIR ADDED. SOMETHING THINK DIDN'T GET THE MATH. YEAH I GOT THERE IS NO MATTER. I THINK DOCTOR WHATEVER'S ON TO GO OVER YOUR STE IN SAM. SO I'M- YEAH FIND A STORIES AND THE COME DOWN WILL LOVE TO HAVE A WE DO ROW WITH TEACHER AND OTHERS TO ALL THE SO. RIGHT FROM WITH THAT MR MCCARTY. HAD A- DATA I'M GONNA TURN THIS OVER YOU MAY WEBER I'VE GOT A WALKING THROUGH FOR FIVE. YEAH THESE ARE JUST OVERALL. THE IN ANY OF YOU COULD. THANK IN A- THE START TEST IT WAS. IT WAS. PHASED OUT INTO THE- TWO TWENTY THIRTEEN CORRECT. YEAH AND- ONE ONE OF THE INTENTS WAS TO. WAS TO HAVE A- GREATER VIEW OF THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE STUDENTS AND NOT HAVE YOU TEACHING TO THE TEST SO. DO YOU AS A BODY THINK THAT. YOU KNOW FIVE TEN YEARS LATER THAT WE PUT YOU THAT GOAL. THE SHORT ANSWER NO HOWEVER I DON'T THINK YOU CAN ACHIEVE THAT GOAL IN FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS I THINK SEVEN TO TEN YEARS IT LEADS TO THE DESTRUCTION OF OUR SIZE IS THE TIME IT TAKES FOR ANY OF THESE- MASSIVE CHANGES LIKE SWITCHING OVER TO COMMON CORE LIKE SWITCHING OVER THE ASPECT MATTERS. AND AS A BELIEVE IT MCCARTY OF DRESSES. MISS WEBBER'S POINT WHICH IS THE REASON THOSE OTHER SCHOOLS ARE DOING SO WELL IS THOSE TEACHERS HAVE BODY INTO THOSE PROGRAMS FOR STUDENTS WHO SHOULD BE FAILING THOSE PROGRAMS. WITH CS TEASER THE START TEST WE BOUGHT IT IS BECAUSE WE KNEW IT WAS AFFECTING OUR API WHICH WAS SOMEHOW GOING TO GET A SEAT THAT BY PRINCIPLE WE KNEW WHAT THE CALIFORNIA. LEADS THE EXAM THE KIDS HAVE TO PASS SO THEY DON'T GRADUATE SO THAT SENSE OF. URGENCY CREATED A BY IN THAT THE ASPECT DOES NOT YET HAVE WITH. AND SO. IT TAKES. LONGER YOU MIGHT WANTED TO BUT I THINK MORE DEVELOPMENT AND OR RESOURCES MORE TRAINING. THAT'S THE KEY TO GET TEACHER BY AND WITHOUT TEACHER BY IN. I THINK IT HAPPENED. THEIR COSTS IN OUR OFF IS UNDER AS WE ARE IN. THE NEW SANCTIONS OUT THE PROGRAM TO IMPROVEMENT- UNDER NO CHILD LEFT BY YOU THEY'LL SEE A SIZE IS LAUNCHING THIS YEAR AND SO IF YOU'RE A SCHOOL THAT SCHOOL TO READ AND ALL OF THE DOW SPORTING CATERS BUT ONE COLORS NOT READ YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A SIZE THE YOUNGER WITH THE NEW PROGRAM APPROVED STATUS. SO THEN WHY ASK TO DO AS A SCHOOL TO YOUR SINGLE PURPOSE UNITS SHE MET AND THEN THE DAILY ACE TO RIDE INTO THEIR ALL CRAP THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO EXPLICITLY HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET OUT AND GET THE RIGHT OFFICE WE DON'T WANT STUDENTS DOT BURNING. DEALS YOU'RE GONNA GET THIS CREEP BACK OKAY WILL WHAT SORT. YOU CAN. THE TO. AND START TEACHING TO THE TEST SO YOU CAN MAKE THE ARGUMENT. BECAUSE THE TEST HAS BEEN VALIDATED. THAT IT'S AS RELIABLE AS THE S. A. T. TO PROTECT- FRESHMAN LEVEL PERFORMANCE AT THE UNIVERSITY FOR UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LEVEL. BUT WE ARE KIND OF CREEPING BACK NOW BECAUSE NOW I HAVE ONE THAT- CONTINUATION SCHOOL. A THE HEALTHY KIDS SURVEY. REGULAR SUBSTANCE ABUSE USERS- THIRTY THIRTY PERCENT- SPECIALLY POPULATION. AND NOW WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE BOOST YOU KNOW ASPECTS. RIGHT AND SO THAT. GOING ON WITH. INSTEAD WE JUST WANT TO THE RANGE BE COMMITTED TO THEM. I AM SO. THE VALUE THE TEACHERS INCOME INTO THE EDGE COUPLE FOR CONTINUATION SCHOOL. BUT IN ORDER TO GET OUT OF. THE SANCTIONS IF YOU WILL YOU'VE GOT TO DO BETTER ON THE ASSESSMENTS. SO THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF PRESSURE US TO GO BACK TO TEACHING TOWARDS THE TEST. NOW AGAIN. THE TEST HAS BEEN VALIDATED SO NOT IN THE- IT'S NOT A BAD GUY SO I SAID MY FACT. IT'S NOT A BAD GOAL TO ASPIRE TO. I WE WOULD BE REMISS IF WE DIDN'T THINK WE WERE STEPPING INTO THAT. INTO THAT ROUND SO THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOP THIS I WASN'T AS OUR TICKET THE FIRST TIME. BORDERS ARE TRYING TO SAY. WE WOULD. MUCH LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENING DOWN. IN SAN DIEGO WE WANT TO FOCUS ON THE HOW. HOW DO WE GET STUDENTS OVER THE BAR. NONE HOW DO WE- I. UNDERSTAND THE TEST QUESTIONS SO WE CAN MAKE. YOU KNOW. WE'RE JUST WE'RE WE'RE FOCUSING ON HOW DO YOU ASKED THE QUESTION VERSES THE LEARNING. THEIR WE LOST OUR WAY A LITTLE BIT OF FOR JUST TRYING TO GAME THE TEST. THAT MAKES SENSE. WANT TO THANK YOU- I'VE BEEN TOLD. BY THE CHAIR OKAY. WELL LET MORE. WHEN THEY WANT TO DO PUBLIC COMMENT OKAY OKAY THIS IS THE- THAT. BIT OF A DIFFERENT TOPIC AND I WAS HOPING- MISTER O'DONNELL IS HERE BUT- STAFF CAN REFER THIS ISSUE TEN THIS IS ABOUT. THE TESTING INDUSTRY. AS FAR AS ASSESSMENT. FOR COLLEGE AGE. SO WITH THAT TO. I WOULD NOT. DATE ON THE- ACT SAT. AND ALLOW YEAR SOME. AND MISTER DON AUTHORED A BILL WHICH I SUPPORTED WHICH SAYS THAT. YOU KNOW NO LOOK AT THIS THING AS- AND AS WELL THERE'S A HUGE INDUSTRY. CERTAIN PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO PAY A TON OF MONEY AND ON. AND A BETTER CHANCE OF COLLEGE THEN LIFE AND OTHER START ALWAYS GET STICKERS NOT PLACES HAVING SOME. ACT IN A CLASSROOM TACIT. ENTRY FRANKLY THE UC BORDER READ ME GET RID OF THE WHOLE THING IN THE FIRST PLACE WAS I THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE VIOLATING AS WELL BUT MY QUESTION TO YOU ALL IS THAT. IN SOME OF THAT STUFF THAT I'VE READ. THERE'S A POTENTIAL THAT THIS TASK COULD BE AT COLLEGE YOU READY ASSESSMENT FOR. ELEVENTH GRADE AND SO FORTH SO IS THAT A REALISTIC PERSPECTIVE% THIS POTENTIALLY- IT BE UTILIZED IN IN IN COLLEGE. APPLICATIONS AND ANALYSIS AND FOCUSED ON EVERY STUDENT HAVE THIS AND THERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY. TO GET. FOR TEST FOR US BACK BUT EVERY STUDENT HAS IT. YOU KNOW YOU KNOW THIS YOU'RE NEVER UNIVERSALLY. AVAILABLE NO I MEAN. I DO AND IF I CAN. SPEAK TO THE WAYS. AS A TEACHER AND INDIVIDUAL WITH MY EXPERIENCE. IT KIND OF IS ALREADY LEADING THAT WAY BECAUSE THE OLD EAP QUESTIONS THAT CAL STATE HAD EMBEDDED IN THE PREVIOUS TEST TO DETERMINE COLLEGE READINESS. ARE THERE NOW IN THE US BACK AND COULD BE DONE FOR THE SAME REASON. BUT AGAIN MY PERSONAL LOGICAL BRAIN SAYS WHAT ELEVENTH GRADERS READY FOR COLLEGE AND WHY ARE YOU BOTHERING WITH THEM. THE OTHER HALF THAT THAT I WEAR SAYS THAT MAKES THE S. BACK VALUABLE IN A- IN A IN A- IN A WAY THAT COULD BEING MEAN MORE THAN IT SHOULD AND SO I'LL JUST ECHO WHAT CHRIS SAID EARLIER ABOUT BECAUSE OF THE STATE. RIGHT YES. FOUR ONE COHORT IN ONE WINDOW FOR AN ENTIRE SCHOOL YEAH. SAID THAT THE ONE COSTS ABOUT ALL THAT'S- GIG SSNS CAN BE USED COLLEGE INTEREST ASSISTANCE CAN BE USED FOR DAY KEEPING THAT'S IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE RESEARCH THE DONE AROUND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM THEY HAVE MOVED TOWARDS THE TEACHERS GRADE IN A COLLEGE PREPARATORY ELECTIVE IN ENGLISH ABOUT AS BEING THE BEST PREDICTOR FOR COMMITTEE COLLEGE SUCCESS. SO HISTORICALLY WHEN YOU'RE USING SOME OF THE SENATE AS FAST AS A GATEKEEPER MECHANISM FOR- INTERESTING TO CREDIT BEARING UNIVERSITY COURSES- YOU WHAT YOU'LL SEE HISTORICALLY IS SINCE POVERTY AND UNDER REPRESENTS ARE GOING TO REPRESENT A GROUPS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE TO DO THE REMEDIATION OF THE ASSESSMENT COMMITTEE WOULD SAY WELL NO WE'RE JUST TELLING YOU THAT'S WHAT THE RESULTS SAY BUT THEN. THERE ARE HABITS OF MINE- WORK ETHIC AND OTHER FACTORS THEY'RE GOING TO PLAY DID HAVE SHOWN THAT THOSE STUDENTS WHO PERFORMED WELL GETTING A HIGH SCHOOL WHEN I GO HAVE GONE ON TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND THERE ANY GAZING IS AND YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THE STATE IT'S- PUBLIC NOTICE TO. WHAT AND ARE. EIGHT THE SHORT. OF MANY CAR TUNES WAY INTO NON. GRAD BEARING FOR. SPECIFIC MEANINGS LANGUAGE ARTS. AND IS NO LONGER THE CASE AND THE STUDENTS ARE PASSING THE COLLEGE COURSES SO. I I'M I'M NOT STE. AS LONG AS THERE IS A ASSESSMENT THAT'S REQUIRED. IT PROBABLY DOES MAKE SENSE TO ALIGN THE S. BACK. TO SEE IF YOU IN UC SYSTEM SINCE IT'S OUR SYSTEM. BUT WE ALSO JUST NEED YOU KNOW LOW CAUTIONARY TALE. IF IT'S USED AS A GATE. TO PREVENT UNDER REPRESENTED GROUPS ARE A R. L. CFF ONTO THE COULD ACCOUNT STUDENTS. FROM ACCESSING HIGHER ED- THAT WOULD BE AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE THAT I WOULD NOT LIKE TO SEE COME TO FRUITION. AND I THINK IN NO WAY. IS THE ASPECT READY TO BE A COLLEGE ENTRANCE TESTS. GIVEN THE CHALLENGES WE'VE HEARD TODAY. WE HAVE TO MASTER THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM BEFORE WE MOVE BEYOND THAT FOR SURE. SO I GET HIGH SOME SALES JUST DO THIS NOW THERE'S A LOT MORE TO IT EXACTLY THEN THAT. WOULD ARE. ANY OTHER MEMBERS WHO TO SPEAK. SEE OTHER COMMENTS BUT I MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC MAY COME TO THE MICROPHONE. I DON'T SEE ANYBODY STANDING UP. THIS IS THE FIRST NOBODY COMING UP TO COMMENT WHILE- SO WITH THAT-% ANY CLOSING COMMENTS FROM ANY AND ANY OF THE- ANY OF THE PRESENTERS HERE TODAY ANY CLOSING COMMENTS. A SINGLE FOR THE CLOSING COMMENTS- WILL CONSIDER THIS MEETING ADJOURNED THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION TODAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR INFORMATION AND LET'S WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A QUALITY ASSESSMENT SYSTEM FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THIS MEETING IS ADJOURNED.
