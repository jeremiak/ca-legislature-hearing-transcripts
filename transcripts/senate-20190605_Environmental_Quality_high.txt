THEIR WARDED UPON THE COMPLETION OF PROGRAM WORK. AND THERE ARE -- THERE THERE AWARD AS REIMBURSEMENTS -- UPON THE COMPLETION OF THESE PROJECTS AND FORCE THE SMALL ORGANIZATIONS. AREN'T ALWAYS ABLE. TO TO PUT UP THESE INITIAL COSTS OF THE PROGRAM AND ARE DETERRED FROM FROM -- APPLYING -- FOR THIS FUNDING IN THE FIRST PLACE AND SO WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IS WE GIVE CAL EPA THE AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE ADVANCE PAYMENTS. AT TWO GRANT RECIPIENTS -- AND IT WOULD THUS. PROVIDE THEM WITH THAT THESE FUNDS UP FRONT -- AND YOU KNOW THIS BILL WOULD RELIEVE THE FINANCIAL PRESSURE OF SMALLER NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AND ALLOW MORE GROUPS. TO PARTICIPATE AND UNDERTAKE THIS VERY IMPORTANT WORK IN THE SMALLER AREAS IN A LOT OF THE AREAS THAT I REPRESENTED ASSEMBLY DISTRICT. NUMBER -- EIGHTY THIRTY SORRY.

IT IS FOR SOME COMMUNITIES BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO RAISE THE FUNDS TO IMPLEMENT -- PROJECTS BEFORE THEY ARE REIMBURSED -- NOT NGOS WORKING AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES NEED EVENTS PAYMENTS BECAUSE THEY NEED FINISH OF CAPITAL TO START THEIR PROJECTS SOME ORGANIZATIONS DON'T HAVE THE LARGE.

NONPROFIT ADVOCACY GROUPS ONE THAT'S ESTABLISHED IN ONCE HAS A PROGRAM AND WANTS. TO GET OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY AND DO EDUCATION AND THE OTHER IS THE ONE THAT'S JUST BEING ESTABLISHES ORGANICALLY GETS ESTABLISH ONE PART OF THE STAFF REPORT TALKS ABOUT IT. A GROUP IN TULARE TWENTY ONE MEMBERS OF THE TASK FORCE. AND I'M I GUESS MY QUESTION IS IS THIS YOUR DOES THE ADVOCACY GROUP DO YOU HAVE A TEMPLATE THAT ASSIST THESE PEOPLE YEAH BECAUSE JUST THIS ONE NUMBER TWENTY ONE MEMBERS ARE TASK FORCE SEEMS. RATHER AND WE'LL LEAVE FOR THE FIRST TIME OUT OF THE GATE FOR NONPROFIT IS SAND JUSTIN IS THERE SOME TEMPLATE THAT YOU CAN. THAT WE'RE GONNA BE USING IT FOR ADVANCING THESE FUNDS. FOR GROUPS TO DO LESS ORGANIZING OF THE OF THE COSTS AND MORE THE COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE WITH THE PUBLIC WHICH IS WHAT I THINK WE WANT IT WITH THE SMALL GRANTS. YES AND THAT'S ALL OUTLINED IN THE GRAND GUIDELINES HE PROCEDURES THAT COUNTY PA HAS DEVELOPED FOR THE PROGRAM SO. YEAH. FOR THE QUESTIONS THAT'S FROM THE COMMITTEE. I HAVE IS THIS SOME INTERCONNECTING. I WOULD MUCH OKAY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE DECEMBER I JUST -- RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OKAY SO THE MATTER HAS BEEN MOVED BY CINEMA CASKEY AND ONCE AGAIN CENTER HILL FAILED TO GET THERE -- WHY DON'T WE -- OF THIS ACT OF ITS COLOR.

SIXTEEN TWENTY EIGHT SO HAPPY TO MISTER CHAIR -- SO. ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTY TWENTY EIGHT IS LEGISLATION RELATED TO OUR STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL. AND THE RELATIVELY NEW BUREAU OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IN SO AS MANY OF YOU KNOW LAST YEAR ATTORNEY GENERAL HOBBY ERR. THAT THIS ERA THE STAFF WAS THE BUREAU OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE WITHIN THE THE THE DOJ. AND HE DID SO TO BEST LEVERAGE THE DEPARTMENT'S ABILITY TO MAKE SURE. TO PEOPLE AND OUR COMMUNITIES -- AND PEOPLE AND TO THE COMMUNITIES IN OUR STATE THAT INDOOR A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH HAZARDS. AS AS A PREVIOUS ANALYSIS OF THIS BILL STATED TOO FREQUENTLY CALIFORNIA'S LOWER INCOME. THE COMMUNITIES AND OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR EXPERIENCE FAR GREATER IMPACTS FROM POLLUTION TOXIC. CONTAMINATION AND THE EFFECTS OF GLOBAL WARMING MORE SO THAN WEALTHIER MORE FLUENT AREAS OF OUR STATE. DOES THESE CALIFORNIANS HAVE BEEN. THE D. DENIED A KEY ROLE OR A VOICE IN THE DECISIONS THAT AFFECT THE QUALITY OF THEIR LIVES. AND SO AS A RESULT THIS BILL. AB SIXTEEN POINT THREE DOES TWO THINGS FIRST IT WOULD ADD TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE DOJ'S BUREAU VINYL JUSTICE TO THE LIST OF AGENCIES THAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. OF PLANNING RESEARCH MISS COURTNEY WITH REGARDING CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE PROGRAMS AND SECOND THE BILL WOULD STRENGTHEN THE DEFINITION OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. TO MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH THE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S [inaudible] THE THEIR THEIR DEFINITION OF I'M A JUSTICE TO SURE THAT COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. OCCURS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IT SENDS A CLEAR MESSAGE THAT IMPACTED THE COMMUNITY THAT THESE PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO BE NOTIFIED AND INCLUDED WHEN IT COMES TO LOCAL PLANNING -- THE DECISIONS -- THAT MAY AFFECT THEIR HEALTH AND THEIR LIVELIHOOD. AND SO CERTAINLY -- EXCITED OF TO TO WORK WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ON THIS ISSUE AS IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR NOT ONLY THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT BUT FOR YOU KNOW THE ENTIRE STATE. SO WITH THAT YOU KNOW WE I I I I WILL ALLOW THE AYE SPONSORS TO DO THIS. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THAT MY NAME IS JASIM JOHNSON I'M WITH PHYSICIANS FOR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY LOS ANGELES AND WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL. AS THE LAND USE AND HEALTH PROGRAM ASSOCIATE AT PS ARE AWAY I EXAMINE THE CRITICAL ROLE IN THAT LAND USE AND PLANNING PLAY IN THE HEALTH. SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF COMMUNITY RESIDENTS ARE REQUIRED COORDINATION BETWEEN OPR AS WELL AS OVERSIGHT AGENCIES AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WILL FURTHER STRENGTHEN POLICIES PUT IN PLACE. TO UPLIFTING PROTECT OVERBURDEN ENVIRONMENT JUSTICE COMMUNITIES. EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY THE BUREAU ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE WILL BE ABLE TO REMOVE THE INSTANCES OF ENVIRONMENT JUSTICE WHERE IT'S NOT BEEN PROPERLY ADDRESSED SUCH AS THE MANY INSTANCES OF INCOMPATIBLE LAND USE AND SOUTH SOUTHEAST AND EAST LOS ANGELES. ADDITIONALLY AB SIXTEEN TWENTY EIGHT BY FORMALLY ESTABLISHING THE DIS BUREAU UMBRELLA JUSTICE ENSURES THERE'S GOING TO BE A PERMANENT BODY IN PLACE IMPROVE ENFORCEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS ON BEHALF OF YOU TO COMMUNITIES. THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN PLACES WHERE THEY LITTLE RESOURCES OR LITTLE INTEREST IN LOCAL ENFORCEMENT OR EVEN REGULATORY FAILURE SUCH IS THE CASE WITH THE WITH THE BATTERY RECYCLING FACILITY IN SOUTHEAST LOS ANGELES. WHERE THOUSANDS OF HOMES ARE POISONED BY MILLIONS OF POUNDS OF LET -- LASTLY BUT OF GREAT IMPORTANCE IMPORTANCE SEES ME IS THE BILL'S EXPANSION OF THE DEFINITION OF OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE INCLUDE MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT. LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES COMMITTEES OF COLOR IN UNINCORPORATED COMMUNITIES -- ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY BEAR THE BURDEN OF POLLUTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL NEGLECT BUT THEY OFTEN LACK THE RESOURCES -- TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY TRULY ENGAGE IN THESE PROCESSES THAT WILL HELP. ADDRESS THESE ISSUES -- THESE RESIDENTS ARE ALREADY OVER BURDENED BY ALL THE OTHER SOCIAL JUST VERY DISPARITIES AND THEY HAVE TO FIGHT TO SIMPLY HAVE INPUT ON ACTUALLY HAS -- SO HE'S MOVING INTO THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS. MOREOVER IN BERLIN JUSTICE HAS STRONG ROOTS IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT YEAH IT'S BEEN CARTED OFF AND STIFLED BY HARMFUL INDUSTRIES AND OTHERS WHO HAVE LITTLE INTEREST IN THE WELL BEING OF THE COMMUNITY. COMMON IS PRECISELY THE HISTORICAL LACK OF COMMUNICATION ABOUT THIS PLACE IS COMMUNITIES IN THIS IN THESE CONDITIONS THAT THERE CONTINUES LEAN DORY. SO ESSENTIALLY ENVIRONMENT JUSTICE WITHOUT COMMUNICATION IS NOT JUSTICE. WE GREATLY APPRECIATE ASSEMBLYMEMBER RIVAS IS LEADERSHIP AND IN PRIORITIZING PROACTIVELY ADDRESSING A PRIMAL INJUSTICE AND ENSURING CLEAN SAFE AND HEALTHY NEIGHBORHOODS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. AND RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE. THANK YOU. I AM MORNING AGAIN OF US BECAUSE AGAIN WITH THE CALVARY ROOM TO SLANTS PRODUCTS ON SPONSOR THE BILL INITIAL ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED SO IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS I'M HERE TO ANSWER THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OTHER FOLKS ONE AT AND IN SUPPORT OF BILL. YEAH [inaudible] SIERRA CLUB. FOR CALLING ON BEHALF OF SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THANK YOU. CHELSEA TO THE CENTER ON RACE POVERTY AND THE ENVIRONMENT -- PRIMARILY WORKING WITH ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES IN THE SOUTHERN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. I ANYONE ELSE IN ONE ONE RAISE CONCERNS OPPOSITION. OKAY THE MATTER IS BEFORE THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS. MR TERMINUS I'M CAN I HAVE SOME CLARIFICATION ON WHAT YOU BELIEVE CONS CONSULTING IS VERSUS COORDINATING BECAUSE THE CURRENT LAW. YOUR IS A PLANNING AGENCY THEY COORDINATE WITH NATURAL RESOURCES IN THE AIRPORT WHEN THEY'RE IMPLEMENTING PLANNING A PLANNING DOCUMENT. AND WE HAVE AN AMBITIOUS PROGRAM FOR THEM AND CLIMB AN ADAPTATION AND CLIMATE -- RESILIENCY FOR THEM TO DO WHEN YOU WHEN WE'RE ASKING THEM TO CONSULT WITH AN ENFORCEMENT AGENCY WITH THE THAT THE PART EIJI NORMALLY YOU DON'T CALL DHEA UNLESS YOU'RE READY TO SUE. THERE THERE THERE ARE LAWYER SO NEW WHEN WE HAVE CONSULTING WHAT. IS THE EXPECTATION. SO IS FOR US TO IS REALLY HAVING ABILITY FOR OPR AND ALSO WHEN NATURAL RESOURCE AGENCY IN OFFICE OF A SEEK HELP YOU TO BE ABLE TO COORDINATE. ON EITHER POSSIBLE CASES ARE HAPPEN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND ALSO ASSISTING A LOT OF MORMONS JUSTICE COMMUNITIES ARE PROBABLY REALLY WORKING WITH -- PR SPECIFICALLY AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE WORKING WITH SB ONE THOUSAND FERMENTATION WHICH IS A MOMENT TO JUST AS I'M GENERAL PLAN. ELEMENT THAT'S HAPPENING SO IF THERE'S ANY -- ISSUES ARE HAPPENING LOCALLY THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BRING THEIR ENVIRONMENTS JUSTICE BUREAU INTO THE PICTURE THAN THIS IS A NATION COR NATION AND NEED TO HAPPEN. AND A LOT OF TIMES ARE A LOT OF ROOM TO STORE DISEASE STORE REALLY KNOW THAT SAID FROM SUCH AS THIS BUREAU IN THE AG'S OFFICE GIVEN THAT'S A FAIRLY NEW BRO HAS ESTABLISHED ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO. SO REALLY GETTING THAT INFORMATION OUT THERE TO COMMUNITIES GIVEN THAT WILL BE OUR HAS BEEN. REALLY MORE OF A INTENTIONAL PARTNER GIVEN THE THE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT INTERACTIONS AND DIFFERENT RESPONSIBILITIES AT THE DEPARTMENT HAS CURRENTLY HOT SO IT'S REALLY MORE FOR US IS HOW DO WE GET THE WORD OUT THERE TO A LOT OF COMMUNITIES ARE CURRENTLY WORKING. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THEIR SITTING COUNTIES ON DIFFERENT ELEMENTS BUT ALSO IS HOW DO WE GET THEM REMOVED AS UNIT TO REALLY -- IF THEY'RE SEEING SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS OP OURS WORK HOW DO THEY ACTUALLY START REALLY WORKING WITH EACH OTHER. YEAH BUT SO THAT WOULD BE A MISTAKE CHAIR SO THAT'S WHAT. A HAND OFF AS IS IF I THINK I HEARD YOU RIGHT IT WOULD BE THAT IF IF OPR IS OUT IN THE COMMUNITY THEY'RE DOING UP. OF RESILIENCY PLAN AND THEY'VE COORDINATE WITH THAT THE E. J. COMMUNITY AND IF THE THEY WILL LET THE THE BUREAU NO THAT THAT THEY'RE DOING AT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THEN IF THEY FOR HERE OF SOMETHING OTHER HERE. OF SOME POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS THAT'S NOT OURS WORK THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO THAT BUT THEY WOULD CONSULTED THE BRING -- DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN EXACTLY SO WANTED THINGS EXAMPLES SB ONE THOUSAND SO WHEN AND IMPLEMENT EIGHT AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ELEMENT IS NOT DONE. INTO THE TO THE LONG -- THERE'S NO REALLY ENFORCEMENT AGENCY OTHER THAN THE AG'S OFFICE SO THIS IS WHERE THE AG'S UNIT WILL ACTUALLY COMMENT AND PROVIDE SOME GUIDANCE IN THEIR HUSBAND RESPOND EXAMPLES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA SPECIFICALLY FRESNO-AND ON THE INLAND EMPIRE WHERE THEY ACTUALLY PROVIDING GUIDANCE TO THIS LOCAL CITY AND COUNTIES TO BE. ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THE ELEMENT -- AND ALSO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE GUIDELINES ON LIKE THIS IS HOW INTENT OF THE LAW THIS IS A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC A CITY OF HOW YOU ACTUALLY SHOULD IMPLEMENT THE ELEMENT. OF GIVEN THE WE DON'T HAVE AN ENFORCEMENT AGENCY SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS -- RIGHT WITH HER PERCY. RIGHT BUT BUT NORMALLY WE DON'T WANT LAWYERS MARKING UP THE PLANNING PROCESS I'M A LAWYER SO I CAN SAY THAT SO. NORMALLY IF YOU IF YOU SEE THAT. IF THERE'S A PROBLEM IF THERE'S A PROBLEM WHEN THEY SEE THAT THERE'S A VIOLATION OR SOMEBODY IN THE COMMUNITY COMES BEFORE THEM AND YOU KNOW BECAUSE AGAIN OPR SIGNED INTO THE ENFORCEMENT IS A WHITE. SO I GET THAT IF THAT'S THE THAT'S THE CONSULTING BUT YOU KNOW SOMETIMES I GUESS I WANT TO BE SURE THAT IT'S NOT. THEY DEVELOP A PLAN OF FOR CLIMATE RESILIENCY AND THEN THEY NEED TO CHECK OFF FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ON IT WHO KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT. RESILIENCY THEY MAY KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAW BECAUSE THEIR LAWYERS ARE SUPPOSED THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE FEELING YEAH IT'S NOT A CHECK OFFICE MORE THE THE GUIDANCE RATE IT'S IS INTERPRETING THE LAW SO IT'S NOT REALLY THAT CHECKING OFF THE BOXES REALLY HEY HOW. DO WE INTERPRET THIS LAW WHEN YOU HAVE TWO DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES LOCAL LEVELS ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH HER A LOT OF ROOM IT'S JUST WE'RE DECISIONS ARE PROBABLY BRINGING A LOT OF THE LAWSUIT. AND FOR THE REALLY NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WE NEED TO HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF WHERE THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE DOES THAT IN ANY OTHER. AREA OF THE LAW BUT THEY WOULD COME IN BEFORE NORMALLY YOU BREAK THE LAW YOU BRING IN THAT BRING AND LAWYERS RIGHT YOU DON'T BEFORE YOU'VE DONE ANYTHING AND YOU JUST PLANNING. I LOVE THE TO THE DPA NEVER HEARD OF IN THE AIRPORT YOU KNOW NORMALLY WE SAY WE SET UP THE PROGRAM WE ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY WE COME UP WITH THAT. RESILIENCY PLAN WHATEVER THAT MAY BE AT OPR TO SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND ALL THE THINGS THAT THEY'RE WORKING AT I JUST. YOU'RE ASKING FOR HIS SPECIFIC EXAMPLES FROM OTHER DPARTMENTS ARE JUST KIND OF OKAY I MEAN I SEE THAT THE AG'S ASK FOR THIS AND I THINK THAT I SEE THAT THERE'S SOME VALUE AND BRING HIM IN. I DON'T WANT IT TO BE TOO HEAVY HANDED WHERE YOU KNOW WE'RE ASKING THE AG WE'RE GOING THROUGH THE PLANNING PROCESS EVERY LITTLE THING THAT'S GOING ON SO THAT'S MY CONCERN I MEAN I'M. WILLING TO MOVE THE BILL FORWARD MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANTED. TO RAISE THOSE CONCERNS. AND UP INTO AND IF I MAY BE SURE YOU KNOW I REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS I THINK HE VALLEY CONCERNS I MEAN HAVING. JUST ESTABLISH THE BILL OF ENVIRONMENT JUST AS I BELIEVE IT WAS IMPLEMENTED IN ORDER ESTABLISHMENT FEBRUARY OF LAST YEAR OF OF OF OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN I THINK ADDING THE BUREAU NO YOU KNOW THOUGHT PROCESS IS ADDING THE BE -- TO THE LIST OF OF OF OF AGENCIES AT OPR MUST CONSULT WITH WILL HAVE A BENEFIT IN THE LONG TERM MEAN WHEN THE WEATHER IMMEDIATE ROLE IS AT THAT TABLE IN THE A CONSULTANT. YOU KNOW THE ROLE -- IS PROBABLY YET TO BE DETERMINED BUT CERTAINLY THE AGES OFFICE IS YOU KNOW ASSUME THIS RESPONSIBILITY OF TAKE A MORE ACTIVE ROLE WHEN IT COMES TO MEMEL JUSTICE ISSUES -- WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT YOU KNOW IF YOU. MISTER CHAIR I JUST UNDERLYING RIGHT NOW OPR DOESN'T CONSULT WITH ANYBODY ELSE THE COORDINATE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION NATURAL RESOURCES ON PROGRAMS TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE NOT. CONSULTED HAS. IT COULD HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT THAT WE WANT YOUR INPUT OR CAN HAVE A YOU KNOW. YOU GET TO VETO POWER OR SOMETHING LIKE ON A PLANNING DOCUMENT WHICH IS I THE REASON I'M RAISING THIS IS THAT I HOPE THAT THAT'S NOT IT THAT THAT'S THAT THAT SAID THIS IS A CHECK IN. AND IF THEY SEE THAT THERE'S A CONCERN. THE LATTER IS MY SENSE OF WHERE THE BILLS BUT THE BILL'S FRIENDS HERE IS THAT IS THAT RIGHT YEAH ABSOLUTELY IS THERE I MEAN IT WE NEED. LANGUAGE CLARITY OF THE THE ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT IT NOT ADEQUATELY. EXPRESSING THAT I THINK THE ATTORNEYS I THINK THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE HAS HEARD YOUR CONCERNS AND WHAT THE I THINK THE RIGHT BALANCE WOULD BE WITH THE OPR. IN THE IN THIS PLANNING PROCESS OKAY. BACKGROUND. DID YOU WANT TO MAKE SENATE VOTE COMMENT YEAH AND THEN -- GIVEN THE ORGAN THE SENATE JUDICIARY NEXUS IS SOMETHING YOU CAN DEFINITELY HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE CLARITY AND ARE WORKING WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND THE LANGUAGE THE WE CAN ACTUALLY CLARIFY BUT I THINK LIKE YOU MENTIONED IS A LOT -- FOR US IS REALLY IT'S NOT REALLY HAVING IT IN ANOTHER. YOU KNOW BARRIER AND IN THE PROCESS OF REALLY HAVING A BETTER SENSE OF HOW THE PROCESS CAN B FACILITATED TO INCLUDE A LOT OF COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN A SNAP SOME KIND. RIGHT OKAY -- ONCE AGAIN ONCE AGAIN JUST THE THE ONE ON THE BALL TODAY. SO THE MOVED IF YOU LIKE TO CLOSE ON AMBER -- HAVE NOTHING ELSE SO SORRY I'M SO SORRY MEADOW VICE CHAIR OF THE CASE QUESTION WE GOT UP TO I DIDN'T JERKY STARTS WITH THE PHONE. I JUST HAVE A PROBLEM THAT WE ARE BASICALLY -- CODIFYING HE AGENCY WITHIN AN AGENCY A BUREAU THAT WAS NEVER REVIEWED BY. THE LEGISLATURE AND I THINK THAT'S WHY YOU GET SOME OF THE CONFUSION ABOUT. WHO COMES FIRST IN TERMS OF THE REVIEW PROCESS IN THE DIRECTION SO I CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT I WOULD HOPE GOING FORWARD THAT THERE'D BE SOME CONSIDERATION? ABOUT A MORE DEFINITIVE THE DEFINITION OF THE MURALS RESPONSIBILITY HE SERVES ON IT. AND THE RELATIONSHIP. THE GOOD SENATOR FROM. FREMONT ABROAD OUT. BECAUSE WE ARE COMMITTING TAX DOLLARS TO A NEW AGENCY IF YOU WILL. AND IT HAS RATHER FAR REACHING ALL RESPONSIBILITIES AND AUTHORITIES OVER SOMETHING SIFTING. ACOSTA SIS THOSE ARE THINGS THAT I BELIEVE SHOULD HAVE BEEN REVIEWED BY THE LEGISLATURE. AND CODIFIED OR LIKE THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE HERE IS MY CONCERN SO -- GOING FORWARD I WON'T SUPPORT IT TODAY BUT CERTAINLY HAVE AN OPEN MIND BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IN THE WAY REVIEWING IT FROM OBVIOUSLY JUST. IS IMPORTANT. WHAT WE SHOULD THE COMMENTS WILL CERTAINLY -- WE'LL DO OUR BEST TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES CLOSE. I HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO ADD I RESPECTFULLY ASK -- FOR AND I THINK THE SENATE SO THE MATTER HAS BEEN MOVED ASSEMBLY CASKEY AS SUCH IT WAS KALRA. ITEM NUMBER ELEVEN A. B.

ME BEGIN BY SAYING THAT I I AM NOT A LAWYER HI AND I WILL BE ABLE TO ANSWER ANY OF THOSE VERY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS BUT THE TWO WITNESSES HERE WELL. YOU KNOW IT ISN'T OFTEN THAT AN AGENCY OF THE STATE ASKS FOR A DIRECTION. AS A RESULT OF A POLICY ADOPTION IN THIS CASE. THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD IS ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL DIRECTION FOR THE COMPLIANCE OFFICE IT. CAUGHT TASK FORCE -- AS THEY WILL BE CONVENING AT THE END OF THIS YEAR. SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL WILL POINT TO SEVERAL POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR NEW OPPOSITE PROTOCOLS THAT WILL COMPLY WITH THE DEFINITION. OF A DIRECT ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT TO CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL WILL ALSO POINT TWO KEY ISSUES PREVENTING CURRENT CALIFORNIA PROJECTS FROM QUALIFYING. OPPOSITE PROJECTS SPECIFICALLY THE ABILITY FOR SMALL LAND. OWNERS. TO WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THE PROJECT COST EFFECTIVE. WE THINK OF AND NETWORKING LANDS PROJECTS WE THINK OF CLIMATE SMART AG PROJECTS AS WELL AS A WEAPON IN PROJECTS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY QUALIFY. AS THE OPPOSITE -- FOR THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM UNDER THE DEFINITION OF THE 50% IN CALIFORNIA DIRECT BENEFIT. ALSO THE FOR THOSE ERE WONDERING WHAT POTENTIALLY THIS BILL MAY DO. A WITH US TODAY IS ONE OF THEM AND I KNOW WITH THE AUDUBON. AS WELL AS JUDGING AMERO FROM CAL CAN TO BE MORE SPECIFIC ON WHAT -- COULD RESULT AS FROM THIS BILL AND GIVE -- THE A RESOURCES BOARD CLEAR DIRECTION -- MOVING FORWARD AS RESULT OF AB THREE NINETY EIGHT THANK YOU. WHAT I MEAN I KNOW THANK YOU -- CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- I'M WITH THE ITEM ON CALIFORNIA HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT WITH AB TWO NINETY FOUR AB. TWO NINETY THREE OUT OF ON CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A LONGTIME ADVOCATE FOR CALIFORNIANS LAND CONSERVATION AND AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION FOR THE BENEFIT OF WILDLIFE. AND PEOPLE AUDUBON'S MISSION IS TO RESTORE AND CONSERVE NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS FOCUSING ON BIRDS AND OTHER WILDLIFE AND THEIR HABITATS. AB TWO NINETY THREE IS A SIMPLE COMMON SENSE BILL THAT REQUIRES AS ARE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA SAID. CLIMATE OFFSET PROTOCOL -- TASK FORCE TO BE APPOINTED BY THE A. R. R. A. R. D. -- TO CONSIDERED THE DEVELOPING ADDITION TO CONSIDER DEVELOPING ADDITIONAL OPPOSITE PROTOCOLS RELATED TO THE ENHANCED MANAGEMENT OR CONSERVATION OF AGRICULTURAL. IN NATURAL LANDS FOR THE ENHANCEMENT AND READ IT. ENHANCEMENT AND RESTORATION OF WETLANDS IN OTHER AREAS WE BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA'S NATURAL WORKING LANCE -- MUST BE AN EXPLICIT PART OF THE STATE'S OVERALL CLIMATE STRATEGIES NOT ONLY TO REDUCE. EMISSIONS BUT ALSO TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES AND RESOURCES FROM THE IMPACTS ALREADY IN MOTION. WHILE THE STATE HAS TAKEN SOME INITIAL STEPS ARE TO BUILD NATURAL AND WORKING LINES INTO INTO CLIMATE POLICIES SIGNIFICAN IN MORE ACTION IS NEEDED. TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S LANDS ARE. A HEALTHY CARBON SINK AND HELP YOU MAKE COMMUNITIES. AND NATURE ADOPTED THE CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE A MANY OTHER MEMBERS HERE HAVE SUPPORTED NUMBER OF NATURAL WORKING LANDS INITIATIVES AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS [inaudible] THIS POLICY. SIMPLY ALLOWS FOR CLARITY FROM THEY ARE BE. TO THE A. R. B. TO MAKE SURE THAT. AS THEY BEGIN TO IMPLEMENT -- THESE PROTOCOLS THAT WE DO IT IN SUCH A WAY THAT IS. ENHANCING THESE AREAS THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME'S JEANNIE MARYLAND WITH THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE AND AGRICULTURE NETWORK WE ARE A COALITION OF SUSTAINABLE AND ORGANIC AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATIONS -- OUR FARMERS DON'T PARTICIPATE IN THE CALIFORNIA CARBON MARKET -- WE ONLY HAVE ONE FUNCTIONAL OFFSETS PROTOCOL THAT IS WORKING FOR FARMERS AS RETIREE DIE JESTERS -- ARM OUR MEMBERS DON'T PARTICIPATE IN THAT PROGRAM SO IT'S NOT WORKING FOR THEM. SOME. IT COSTS THE TRANSACTION COSTS FOR FARMERS TO PARTICIPATE ARE TOO HIGH OR TOO FEW PROTOCOLS AND ESSENTIALLY CALIFORNIA DOES NOT HAVE FUNCTIONAL AGGREGATION OF ALL SET PROJECTS THE AGGREGATION IS THE IDEA THAT A GROUP OF FARMERS WOULD COME TOGETHER -- THAT WE SHOULD LOWER THEIR TRANSACTION COSTS AND THEN THEY CAN PARTICIPATE IN THE CARBON MARKET BUT UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S NOT HOW IT'S WORKING VERIFICATION COSTS REMAIN TOO HIGH AND AS A CONSEQUENCE. OF FARMERS -- CAN'T PARTICIPATE IN THE CARBON MARKET IT ALSO MAKES IT VERY THERE'S NOT MUCH OF AN INCENTIVE -- FOR DEVELOPERS IN CALIFORNIA TO DEVELOP NEW -- PROTOCOLS THAT ARE RELEVANT -- FOR CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE BECAUSE THEY KNOW IT'S GONNA BE REALLY TOUGH. TO GET FARMERS TO PARTICIPATE WE THINK A. B.. RAISES THE BAR A LITTLE BIT PRIORITIZE IS THE IMPORTANCE OF NATURAL WORKING LANDS -- OFFSET PROJECTS -- AND WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT -- ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF FOLKS WANT TO ADD ON GOOD MORNING CHAIR. GOOD MORNING CHEN MEMBERS THREE SEPARATE IMAGE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA COMPOST COALITION IN SUPPORT. IS -- ELEVEN SALAS WITH THE NATURE CONSERVANCY ALSO IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING NATALIE KNOCKS ON BEHALF OF MY PENCIL REGIONAL OPEN SPACE DISTRICT AND SUPPORT. MORNING MR CHAIR MARK FENSTER MAKER FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS IN SUPPORT. THE CHAIR TONY BRUNELLO REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA FORCED CARBON COALITION WHICH HAS TEN OF THE LARGEST FORCED OFFSET PROVIDERS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. OKAY -- ANYONE WANTS TO RAISE OPPOSITION CONCERNS. NO OKAY AS I WAS BEFORE THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS -- SENATE HELLO THIS RESTAURANT. OBSERVE A CASKET I HAVE I HAVE A CONCERN I APPRECIATE. THE EFFORT HERE WHAT I'M I WANT TO RAISE A POINT WITH REGARD TO THAT JOINT LETTER THAT WE SENT ITS REFERENCE IN THE REPORT -- TO THE AIRPORT ABOUT THE OFFSET PROTOCOLS IN ABOUT THE VERIFICATION OF THE OFFSETS AND I'M WONDERING HOW THE TIMING WORKS IS THAT. THE BILL WAS INTRODUCED IN FEBRUARY AND MEND IN APRIL WE SENT THE LETTER TO THE AIRPORT SAYING WE HAVE SOME SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT HOW OFFSETS ARE CALCULATED WE'VE GOT -- EITHER A AGREES TO OR AN 80% LEAKAGE WHICH IS THE CLIMATE. ACTION RESERVE SAYS AND WE GET A BLOW OFF LETTER FROM THEM. WE GET A WE GET A BLOW OFF LETTER FROM THE AIR RESOURCE BOARD SO NOW WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE WE'RE THE THE BILL. IS. ASKING FOR RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THIS COMPLIANCE OFFICE PROTOCOL TASK FORCE. THEY'RE NOT ANSWERING THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE QUESTIONS BY THE LEGISLATURE. AND I'M WONDERING IF IT SENDS THE WRONG MESSAGE TO SEND THE TIMING. I BELIEVE I SIGNED ON TO THE LETTER YOU DID YOU DID AND I ALSO SIT ON THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD OF THE EXHIBITION BOARD MEMBER AND SO. IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE FOLLOWING UP WITH THEM -- WE SEE THIS KIND OF AS AN AND PARALLEL -- THEY'VE ASKED FOR SOME. DIRECTION. AND THIS IS WHAT WE'RE KIND OF PUTTING BEFORE THEM -- I KNOW THAT THE OFFICE OF PROTOCOL TASK FORCES SET TO MEET. OUR TOWARDS THE END OF THIS YEAR. AND WE ANTICIPATE. SOME MOVEMENT I'M HOPING THAT THIS BILL WILL KIND OF STIMULATE SOME CLEAR DIRECTION AND ALSO SOME. MORE CLEAR RESPONSE -- FROM THEM. TO OUR LETTER SO -- HAPPY TO REPORT BACK TO YOU AND WORK WITH YOUR REPRESENTATIVE -- ON THE AIR RESOURCES OARD WHICH IS SENATOR -- MONEY YES -- TO ENSURE THAT WE MORE SUBSTANTIVE A RESPONSE. TO THE LETTER THAT WE SENT. TO THEM SELECT. WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT THE TASK FORCE WILL BE ABLE TO WITH CHEESE IN THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT. WAS NOT. DELINEATED IN OUR LET HER. AS FAR AS THE DIFFERENCES OF THE THAT THE DEFICIENCIES IN THE CURRENT OFFICE AND PROGRAM. WELL I THINK WE SHARE SOME OF YOUR FRUSTRATIONS -- AND ARE WANTING TO SEE -- THERE RESOURCES BOARD PRIORITIZE THE ABILITY OF SMALL LANDOWNERS FARMERS TO PART. OUR HOPE IS THAT THROUGH BY ELEVATING THESE ISSUES TO THE TASK FORCE -- THAT WILL SPUR GREATER ATTENTION AT THEIR RESOURCES BOARD FOR THESE ISSUES THERE HAVE BEEN CONVERSATIONS AT AIR BE AROUND. THE HIGH COST OF PARTICIPATION IN THE CARBON MARKET -- THERE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSIONS AROUND WAYS -- TO ALLOW FOR THE INTEGRITY OF PROJECTS BUT MORE CHEAPLY VERIFY THEM -- SO THAT GREATER ACCESS IS IS POSSIBLE WE THINK THAT THE TASK FORCE CAN SEIZE UPON SOME OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WE HOPE ELEVATE THEM. AND PRIORITIZE THEM IN A WAY THAT WE JUST SIMPLY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO SO FAR YEAH AND I'M JUST CONCERNED ABOUT THE FUNDAMENTAL INCONSISTENCIES AS WEPOINTED OUT. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FOREST LAND I MEAN THE THE THIS IS THE STATE SENATE. CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AND ANOTHER FOR MANURE MANAGEMENT RAT RATHER THAN -- GESTURES FOR YOUR CONSTITUENCY BUT WE CAN'T EVEN AGREE ON HOW YOU COUNT THE HUNDRED YEAR FOREST -- OFFSETS WITH THE IT'S IN ONE YEAR WHEN YOU CUT DOWN THE TREES OR OVER THE COURSE OF A HUNDRED YEARS AND AND I GUESS I'M SO DISSATISFIED WITH THE RESPONSE THAT I GOT THAT I'M WORRIED THAT. THAT THIS IS AN ACQUIESCENCE OF YOU KNOW GOING FOR WITH THIS BILL GIVEN HOW THEY YOU KNOW RESPONDED TO YOU AND I AND EVERYBODY ELSE WHO SIGNED THIS LETTER -- SO ONE THING YOU KNOW I I AM. COMMITTED TO IS KIND OF CONTINUING TO PUSH THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE RAISED IN. THAT LETTER -- TO THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. AS I MENTIONED IN MY OPENING COMMENTS THE TASK FORCE. pTIME -- AT THE END OF THIS YEAR. SO MANY OF THESE QUESTIONS THAT WILL BE RAISED AND HOPING THAT WERE ABLE TO GIVE SOME -- ELEVATION IT WAS MENTIONED TO SOME OF THESE ISSUES THAT WERE PRESENT IN HERE. IN THIS PARTICULAR POLICY BUT ALSO THAT WERE RAISED IN THE QUEST IN THE ACTUAL LETTER THAT WE COLLECTIVELY SIGN ON TO ARE COMMITTED TO CONVENE PUSHER AND I'M SURE THAT YOUR REPRESENTATIVE CENTER MONNING WOULD BE -- VERY HELPFUL IN THAT EFFORT AS WELL. I WILL EXPRESS TO HIM MY SENSE OF URGENCY TO MEETING THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGETS AND I'M NOTHING SHORT OF FURIOUS WITH THE AIR RESOURCE BOARD ON THIS RESPONSE AND AGAIN I JUST LATER. REESE MY CONCERNS THAT THAT. IN THE THERE MAY BE A MISINTERPRETATION OF OUR ACQUIESCENCE WITH. WITH THE WAY THAT THE BILL IN THE CURRENT STRUCTURE THAT SIN RIGHT NOW THAT IT'S NOT. MORE FORCEFUL ASSEMBLYMEMBER EGGMAN IT'S YOUR BILL IT'S YOUR BILL HI BUT BUT IT'S NOT MORE FOR SPOKE TO SAY YOU'VE GOT TO HEAR SOME BARE MINIMUMS ON ON WHAT WE THINK THAT THE PROTOCOL SHE'LL BE AND YES WE'D LIKE THE THE TASK FORCE THE ELEVATED BUT THIS IS THE FLOOR. FOR GOD SAKES AND BUT THAT OF RETURN. TO THE CHAIR. YEAH I KNOW I APPRECIATED I IM. YEAH I'M AS AS YOU KNOW THIS WHOLE BOSSA CONVERSATIONS CONTROVERSIAL AND AND THERE'S A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH ON THIS. I CERTAINLY IF IF THERE'S ANY ANTICIPATION OF SIGNIFICANT CHANGES THIS BILL WHAT WE WANT TO HAVE IT BACK HERE THIS COMMITTEE BUT TIME. HI BUT I THINK IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A REASONABLE ANSWER LEAN WITHIN LINE WITH WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO. IN THIS AREA SO -- YEAH -- YES CENTER HELL. YEAH YOU YOU YOU'VE YOU'VE BEEN VERY PATIENT -- SO -- SENATE BILL MOVES THE BILL -- WITHOUT ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THIRTY PLEASE COLOR OF ITEM NUMBER ONE AB TWO NINETY THREE THE MOTION IS TO PASS THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. ALLEN. ALLEN RIGHT BATES. BATES AYE HILL. HILL AYE SKINNER. STERN. STERN AYE STONE. STONE I LIKE KELSEY. HI. THANK YOU FOR YOUR MUCH THANK YOU AS A MEMBER I I SEE SOME MEMBER OBERNOLTE IS HERE. TO PRESENT ITEM NUMBER TWO IN YOUR PACKET THAT'S AB. THREE NINETY FOUR OTHERS LAURA FRIEDMAN HIDING IN THE BACK. WOW LOOK AT YOU. OKAY. YOUR NEXT. AS A MEMBER. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- I'M SURE EVERYONE ON THE COMMITTEE IS FAMILIAR WITH THE DEVASTATING CAMPFIRE FROM LAST YEAR WAS THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE AND DEADLY FIRE IN CALIFORNIA STATE HISTORY. IT COMPLETELY DESTROYED THE TOWN OF PARADISE BY THE POINT UNITS BERRIEN SEVERAL MONTHS AGO WITH ALONG WITH SEVERAL OF YOU OF TOURING THE DEVASTATED TOWN. LICENSING FIRSTHAND THE DESTRUCTION OF THAT FIRE HAD WROUGHT. I'LL TELL YOU SOME. A FASCINATING STATISTICS ABOUT THAT FIRE OVER HALF OF THE STRUCTURES THAT WERE BURNED BY THAT FIRE WERE BURNED WITHIN TWO HOURS OF THE FIRES IGNITION THAT'S HOW FAST THAT FIRE SPREAD. AND SOME OF THE MOST AMAZING TESTIMONY THAT WE HEARD WHEN WE WERE. IN THE TOWN OF PARADISE WAS FROM THE FIRST RESPONDING AGENCIES THEY TOLD US ABOUT COMPLETE GRIDLOCK GETTING OUT OF PARADISE THAT DAY. DICE HAS FOUR DIFFERENT EGRESS ROUTES AND ALL FOUR OF THEM WERE COMPLETELY CLOGGED WITH DISABLED VEHICLES BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE A FIRE THAT MOVES THAT QUICKLY. OBVIOUSLY WHEN PEOPLE SEE THE FLAMES ADVANCING TOWARDS THEM THEY JUST BILLION THEY LEAVE THEIR VEHICLES WHERE THEY ARE AND SO NO ONE COULD GET OUT AFTER THAT OCCURRED. AND SO WE HAD THE THE HIGHWAY PATROL AND THE SURE OF TELLING US ABOUT PEOPLE SHELTERING IN THE MIDDLE OF INTERSECTIONS IN THEIR CARS BECAUSE THAT WAS AS FAR AS THEY CAN GET AWAY FROM. OF FLAMMABLE VEGETATION OTHER OTHER PEOPLE THE TESTIFIED ABOUT GOING AND FINDING A MEADOW BUT THEY COULD SHELTER IN THE MIDDLE OF UNFORTUNATELY MOST OF THOSE PEOPLE SURVIVED IT REALLY ILLUSTRATES. THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA WITH LACK OF EGRESS TO SOME OF OUR MOST FIRE PRONE COMMUNITIES. OF THIS BILL AB THREE NINETY FOUR IS A SMALL RESPONSE TO THAT IT CRACKED CREATES A VERY NARROWLY CRAFTED EXEMPTION TO SEE WHAT FOR THE PURPOSE OF CREATING. NEW EGRESS ROUTES OUT OF OUR COMMUNITIES THE REBEL FIRE PRONE AND THE DON'T HAVE SUFFICIENT EGRESS. SO. WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT FOR OF PARADISE HAVING FOUR DIFFERENT EGRESS ROUTES MANY COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. I HAVE FEWER THAN THAT IN FACT I LIVE IN A COMMUNITY WITH ONLY THREE THERE ARE MANY COMMUNITIES WITH ONLY TWO OR ONLY SINGLE EGRESS ROUTE AND SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO STRIKE. A VERY APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN TRIED PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT AND PROVIDE PROJECTS APPROPRIATE REVIEW ON THE ONE HAND AND ALLOWING FOR THESE PROJECTS TO MOVE FORWARD IN SOLVING THIS IMPORTANT PROBLEM ON THE OTHER HAND SO I DIED RESPECTFULLY REQUEST FOR AYE VOTE ON AB. THREE NINETY FOUR THANK YOU SOME MEMBER CAN I JUST CONFIRM THAT YOU ARE TAKING IMMENSE FROM THE COMMITTEE THE MEN OF ARE THE AMENDMENTS OKAY LET'S TALK ABOUT AMENDMENTS MISTER CHAIRMAN -- HALF THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS I THINK MAKE THE BILL BETTER IT ALIGNS. THE REQUIREMENTS FOR A SEQUEL EXEMPTION FOR THIS FOR THESE EGRESS PROJECTS WITH THE EXPEDITED FOREST MANAGEMENT PROJECTS AT THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED. I THINK THEY DO MAKE THE BILL BETTER IN THEIR CORPORATE WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE THOSE HOWEVER I HAVE TO EXPRESS A LITTLE BIT OF FRUSTRATION. BECAUSE I'M A DETAIL GUY AND I WHEN I TALK ABOUT AMENDMENTS I LIKE TO SEE LANGUAGE AND SO I I UNDERSTAND THE COMMITTEE HAS SOME DRAFT LANGUAGE THAT I WASN'T ALLOWED TO SEE THEY WOULDN'T GET IT TO ME. MILEAGE RECORDS COME IN MAKE NOTES BUT HE COULDN'T TAKE A COPY AND SO I HAVEN'T READ. WHAT THE COMMITTEE HAS COME UP WITH SO I HAVE SOME THAT WE WE TAKE OUR BEST STAB AT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE COMMITTEE WAS GETTING OUT AN ACT IF IF IF YOU'D LIKE I'LL READ THEM? TO YOU WHAT WHAT WE'RE SUGGESTING WE DO WITH THE BILL [inaudible] I'M. OKAY -- I MEAN IT WILL LET ME. WITH THAT WELL LET ME ASK LET ME LET LET ME LET HIM PROCEED LET ME JUST ASK YOU ARE YOU ARE YOU CONCEPTUALLY ABSOLUTELY ON THE SAME PAGE WITHOUT ABSOLUTE THE WAS IT JUST A MATTER SHERMAN WAY WHICH IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT -- THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT WHEN WE LET YOUR WITNESS PERCENT ENEMIES HAVE A QUICK SIDEBAR STAFF ON THIS -- YES SIR. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING JOHN KENNEDY WITH THE ROLE COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA WE'RE STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BILL -- AS MR OBERNOLTE NOTED IT IS VERY NARROWLY TAILORED IT IS ONLY -- APPLICABLES AUX IN HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS AND ONLY FOR THOSE PROJECTS IDENTIFIED BY THE BOARD OF FORESTRY THE B. O. F. UNDER AB TWENTY NINE ELEVEN IS GOING TO GO OUT AND IDENTIFY PROJECTS THAT ARE NEEDED FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ONLY HAVE ONE EGRESS ROUTE. SO THIS IS EXACTLY THE TYPE OF EXPEDITED CONSTRUCTION OF THOSE PROJECTS IT FILLS A GAP WHERE EXISTING SEQUEL EXEMPTIONS JUST DON'T WORK -- EXEMPTIONS FOR ROAD SAFETY PROJECTS THAT MISTER OBERNOLTE HAD -- EXTENDED THE SUNSET DATE LAST ESSION -- THOSE EXISTING EXEMPTIONS GENERALLY ONLY APPLY TO COUNTY IS LESS THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE SO THAT EXEMPTS THE TOP THIRTY FIVE COUNTIES BY POPULATION FROM BEING ABLE TO USE THAT FOR THESE PURPOSES. AND THERE'S ALSO A PROVISION IN THERE THAT SAYS THAT IT CAN'T INCREASE CAPACITY -- WILL YOU KNOW IF YOU NEED A SECONDARY ADDRESS ROUTE WERE TO IMPROVE A SECONDARY ADDRESS ROUTE YOUR BY DEFINITION GOING TO INCREASE CAPACITY SO I THINK THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT SPECIFIC FOCUSED SEQUEL EXEMPTION. THAT WOULD REALLY BENEFIT THESE COMMUNITIES AND REALLY IMPROVE FIRE SAFETY. THANK YOU SIR I TOOK THE ONE AT ON IN SUPPORT. SB WELCOME HAVE THE COUNTY OF WHATEVER YOUR COUNTY FOR SUPERVISORS ALSO SUPPORT YOUR YOUR SINGLE PICKY WITH A CALIFORNIA FORESTRY ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT -- CHRISTMAS KAYLEE MISTER CHAIR CHRIS FOR KAYLEE ON BEHALF OF THE HUMBOLDT MENDOCINO REDWOOD COMPANIES ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. GOOD MORNING THE AS A RETURN CAL CHAMBER ALSO IN SUPPORT. THE MORNING SO YOU FROM HAVE THE CIVIL JUSTICE CESSATION CALIFORNIAN THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. YOU'RE MUCH. I ANYONE OPPOSITION TRUCKS ONEROUS CONCERNS WITH THE BILL. OKAY THE MEASURE FOR THE COMMITTEE I SEE CENTER STONE WAS AS QUESTION AND OUR STAFF SIR. PROGRAMMING ON THE LANGUAGE RELATED IMMENSE BUT THAT'S UNDERSTAND YET JUST A QUICK COMMENT MISTER CHAIR -- I REPRESENT THE THE COMMUNITY OF IDYLLWILD AND IDYLLWILD HAS ONE WAY IN AND ONE WAY OUT. AND THE CRANSTON FIRE WAS THERE AND IT WAS ONE OF TWO MAJOR FIRES -- IN MY DISTRICT AND THAT WAS CAUSED BY AN ARSONIST FORTUNATELY. IT WAS STARTED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE MOUNTAIN NOT AT THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN HAD STARTED AT THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN. WE WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT THE OF COURSE THE THE DEVASTATION HAPPENED THE PARADISE FIRE WITH ALMOST A HUNDRED ADDRESS WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT PROBABLY TWO THOUSAND US. AND SO THIS TYPE OF LEGISLATION IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR MY MOUNTAIN COMMUNITY THAT UNDER DURESS OF UNINSPIRED YOU MENTIONED WITHIN TWO HOURS HOW MANY STRUCTURES WERE. WERE WERE LOST -- THIS THIS IS GOING TO HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE ABILITY FOR ISOLATED COMMUNITIES TO QUICKLY EVACUATE. AND AND GET AROUND THESE CLOGGED CLOGGED ROADS THAT THE IN A PROVIDE LIMITED THAT ACCESS TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT. SO I APPRECIATE YOU BRING IT FORWARD IT IS VERY NARROW -- SO I THINK -- OF THOSE THAT MIGHT BE CONCERNED ABOUT IS SICK WITH EXEMPTION SO WILL UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN EMERGENCY SITUATION IN A VERY. ISOLATED -- AREAS OF THE STATE WHICH THERE AREN'T AS A AS MANY. AND SO -- I'D BE DELIGHTED TO TO MOVE YOUR BILL AND HOPE WE GET A UNANIMOUS VOTE OUT [inaudible] THANK YOU. THE QUESTION FIVE YEAH SOME ACOSTA. SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE EXECUTIVE ORDER THE GOVERNOR'S ISSUED ALLOWS FOR A SECONDARY IGRICE ANYWHERE THAT THE FIRE -- STATE FIRE MARSHAL AND THE FORCE OF THE PARTNER FOR STREET -- DETERMINES THEY NEED ONE THIS IS THAT WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT -- LAST YEAR'S ASSEMBLY WOMAN FRIEDMAN HAD A BILL THAT DIRECTED THE DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY TO IDENTIFY FIRE PRONE COMMUNITIES THAT HAD ONLY A SINGLE EGRESS ROUTE. AND WORK TOWARDS CONSTRUCTING A SECOND AND THIS IS INTENDED TO BE A FOLLOW ON BILL TO THAT -- TOO TO ALLOW THE CONSTRUCTION OF THAT SECOND ROOM RIGHT BUT BUT IT'S MORE THAN THAT BECAUSE EXECUTIVE ORDER ALSO ALLOW FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF OF EXISTING -- ROADS TO IMPROVE THE THE EGRESS AND INGRESS I GUESS ON THOSE CD WOULD AGREE WITH THAT PRIDE. I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION SETTLED THE THE LAW OR GUESS. OUR STAFF REPORT HIGHLIGHTS THE LAW IS IS THAT THE FIRE MARSHAL ALREADY HAS A SECRET EXEMPTION TO IMPROVE THE ROADS THAT EXIST IN THIS HIGH FIRE AREA THANK YOU WHAT YOU'RE SPEAKING TO THAT THEY CAN DO THAT NOW IF THERE'S YOU KNOW NARAL NESS AND LIMIT LIMITED -- MANEUVERABILITY THEY CAN DO THAT RIGHT NOW TO IMPROVE IT BECAUSE OF THE LESSONS THAT WERE LEARNED. RIGHT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IMPROVEMENT AND THIS RENTALS A LITTLE BIT BROADER THAN THAT BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE CREATION OF ADDITIONAL EGRESS RIGHT I'M I'M GETTING THERE I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KNOW THAT YOU CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW UNDER THE SEAT. THAT THE FIRE. DEPARTMENT FOR SCREEN THE FIRE MARSHAL CAN GO IN AND SAY WE WANT TO IMPROVEMENTS THAT THESE EXISTING. ROADS WE WANTED IF WE DON'T HAVE A SECONDARY EGRESS WE WANT TO WE WANT TO CREATE A SECONDARY HE CHRIS RIGHT SO THAT'S THAT'S ALREADY THERE THE GUIDANCE THAT WE'VE ADAPTED. THIS WOULD ALLOW FOR ADDITIONAL OF POTENTIALLY A THIRD FOURTH ROAD THAT BOYS THAT WOULD IMPROVE THE FIRE SAFETY. I'M NOT I'M NOT -- DETERMINED THAT BUT THAT'S THAT'S SUBJECT TO ONE PUBLIC HEARING AND THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THAT -- SUPPORTER FOR STREET AND THE FIRE MARSHAL SET YOUR UNDERSTANDING RIGHT CERTAINLY OUT IN ADDITION TO ALL OF THE OTHER RESTRICTIONS IN OVERSIGHT THAT HAS BEEN ADDED TO THE BILL -- BOTH IN THE ASSEMBLY ON HERE SO -- IT'LL BE SUBJECT ONCE WE GET DONE WITH THE AMENDMENTS WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME OVERSIGHT THAT THE FORCE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES SUPPORT. JUST THAT -- HAVE BEEN. A PROPOSED BY GOVERNMENT NEW SUMMERS SERVICES TO ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT -- THAT ONE'S CONSTITUENCY HAS IS THAT WE HAVE FIRE ROADS AND THEY'RE DESIGNED. FOR AS WITH THE STATE FIRE ROADS THE CONCERN IS THAT IF THOSE GET IMPROVE THAT THEY BECOME REGULAR -- THOROUGHFARES IN THE MOUNTAIN AREA I MEAN IF. A IT MAY IMPROVE IN THE STATE OF EMERGENCY WITH THERE'S A FIRE PEOPLE GETTING OUT THAT'S THAT'S AND BUT IT ALSO WOULD IMPROVE THE INGRESS AND EGRESS. DURING NORMAL TIMES IS IT DO YOU ANTICIPATE THAT FIRE ROADS UNDER. YOUR BILL. AND YOUR BILL WOULD BE ABLE TO MEET THAT -- IMPROVEMENT -- CRITERIA WELL I ACTUALLY HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT WAY SENATOR I'M JUST TRYING TO CREATE NEW WAYS OF GETTING PEOPLE OUT OF THESE COMMUNITIES WHEN WE HAVE THESE DEVASTATING FIRES THAT ARE SO FAST MOVING. SO RIGHT THANK YOU SO I I'M I'M TRYING TO MAKE A DETERMINED A DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN AN ADDITIONAL FIRE ROAD THAT'S MADE FOR IN THE EVENT OF A FIRE HERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO GET OUT OF THE CANYON OR UP ON THE HILL. AND IMPROVING BECAUSE AS I CAN MAYBE IT'S JUST IMPROVING THE EXISTING ACCESS ROAD THAT THERE WOULD BE A YOU KNOW PAVEMENT OF ALL HE FIRE ROADS THAT ARE THERE THAT WEREN'T REALLY DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE TO BE ON ALL THE TIME SO. I DON'T I JUST SPOTTING THE ISSUE I'M NOT REALLY SURE -- WHAT THE AMENDMENTS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT A MINUTE I'M GONNA DEFER TO MY EX GREAT? SO WITH RESPECT TO THOSE FIRE ROADS -- I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THE BOARD OF FORESTRY RECOGNIZED IS THAT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE THESE FIRE ROADS -- THEIR DIRT ROADS LEADING IN THE MIDDLE OF NO WHERE -- THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF A FOREST IN THE EVENT OF A FOREST FIRE AND SO YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE. SCARED AND THEY'RE SCARED TO USE THOSE VIRUS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT EXACTLY SURE WHERE THEY WILL LEAD THEM THERE ON IMPROVE TOWARDS ARE GOING TO BE -- CHALLENGES GETTING YOUR CAR OUT THAT FIRE ROAD THAT YOU WOULDN'T NECESSARILY HAVE WITH MAYBE. A FIRE ENGINE OR SOMETHING SO I THINK THIS BILL AND THE BOARD OF FORESTRY OR LOOKING AT WAYS TO IMPROVE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE ABILITY TO USE THOSE FIRE ROADS. THAT MIGHT BE PAVING IT MIGHT BE REALLY WHATEVER THE BOARD OF FORESTRY DETERMINES WOULD MAKE THE PUBLIC FEEL SAFER TO USE THOSE ROAD SUCCESSFULLY IN THE EVENT OF A FIRE. AIM IS CHAIRED FALLING ON THAT. IN THE EVENT OF A FIRE YOU YOU SAID. THESE WOULD ALSO BE ELIGIBLE FOR USE THOUGH NOT IN THE EVENT OF FIRE CORRECT [inaudible] HE'S ROADS. SO IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE ROADS I DO BELIEVE WOULD HAVE TO BE OPEN -- SO YEAH YOU COULDN'T HAVE CHANGE YOU COULDN'T HAVE GATES ACROSS THE ROADS BECAUSE THAT'S ANOTHER ONE OF THE THINGS THE BOARD OF FORESTRY IDENTIFIED AS BEING AN IMPEDIMENT. IF THERE'S YOU KNOW A GATE ACROSS THE ROAD IT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT. TO GET THROUGH IF THERE'S A TRAIN IT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT TO GET WORSE RIGHT. I AM YEAH WE WENT THROUGH WOLSEY -- AND WE WERE LUCKY IN THAT. SPECIFIC COAST HIGHWAY WHICH ENDED UP BECOMING. ONE OF THE MANY GRASSES -- THE FIRED AND HIT AT THE SAME TIME EVERYONE WAS STUCK ON IT. MY GRANDPARENTS FOR SEVEN HOURS SITTING THERE JUST SITTING DUCKS BUT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. COULD OF BUT THIS CANYON ROADS TO AND THAT'S HOW WE LOST PEOPLE BEEN LEASE MANY. ON LOST TO PEOPLE. SHORT TERM RESPIRATORY ANOTHER. ISSUES BUT TO YEAH THIS GOES BEYOND -- JUST SIMPLE NO SEEK WHAT POLICY IF IT'S EVER CONSIDERED SIMPLE INTO LIFE AND DEATH ISSUE SO I RECOGNIZE THE GRAVITY OF THE THE BILL -- IS STILL TRYING TO GET I WANT TO GET MY HEAD AROUND WHAT. THE MEN'S YOU'RE GONNA BE AND ALSO -- HOW THE? THE TIMBER HARVEST PIECE IS GOING TO WORK IN RESOURCES I KNOW WE'RE DOUBLE REFERRED HERE TODAY -- SO I WANT TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT ALL THAT BUT I APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATION AND I SORT OF I WANT TO JUST. GET A MORE THOROUGH LOOK AT EXACTLY THESE ARE REALLY SENSITIVE AREAS IT'S COMPLEX CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING ALSO TO JUST TO TRY TO GET A BETTER SENSE MAYBE EVEN FROM CAL FIRE IN ADVANCE BUT WHAT WHAT WHAT WE'RE EXPECTING AN ANSWER TO HOW TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE COMMUNITY ABOUT. WHAT WE CAN SEE? YOU KNOW LIKE WHAT WE'RE COULD A SECOND OR THIRD. OR FOURTH EGRESS BE NECESSARY IN PLACE LIKE TO PAYING A CANYON OR UP IN THEIR STONE'S HILLS OR WHEREVER ELSE SO. DO YOU DO YOU HAVE THAT NOW IS THAT SOMEONE WE CAN TRY TO KICK THE TIRES ON BEFORE NEXT COMMITTEE IF IT IF IT MAKES OUT TODAY JUST TO SORT OF LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM CAL FIRE ALREADY ABOUT WHERE THE S. R. A. NEEDS ARE. IT DOESN'T WE NEED TO FLESH OUT MORE YOU THINK YOU HAVE THAT DATA NOW. SO WE CAN GIVE A REASON LOW EXPECTATION LEAST THE PUBLIC. I MEAN I I GET THERE'S GONNA BE A HEARING BUT WE WANT TO SIR I WANT TO DO GOOD PUBLIC COMMUNICATION IN THE FIRES ON AND JUST LET ME KNOW WHAT THEY'RE EXPECTING SO. SURE WELL I'M HOPING THAT SOME OF THE OVERSIGHT LANGUAGE WERE HEADING TO THE BILL WILL GIVE YOU SOME COMFORT THERE BECAUSE AFTER TALKS ABOUT THINGS LIKE A BEST FORCE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND IN OVERSIGHT. THE ONLY THING THEY HAVE I'M SO UNDER THE BILL AMENDMENTS TAKEN AN ASSEMBLY NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE BASICALLY SAY THAT ANY. COMMERCIAL TIMBER THAT'S HARVESTED HAS TO COMPLY WITH THE FOREST PRACTICES ACT -- UNDER THE SANITY Q. PROPOSED AMENDMENTS OTHER PROVISIONS THAT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THE PROJECT AND THE PROJECT APPLICANT TO COMPLY WITH BEST. PRACTICES AND RAGS TO THAT WERE ADOPTED UNDER THE FOREST PRACTICES ACT -- I THINK ONE OF THE AUTHORS -- INTENSE WAS TO CLARIFY THAT THOSE PROVISIONS APPLY TO FORESTRY APPLY TO THE REMOVAL OF TREES WITH RESPECT TO SOME SORT OF WATER COURSES YOU KNOW THEIR WETLANDS PROTECTIONS BUILT INTO THE BILL ALREADY SPECIES PROTECTIONS CAN'T IMPACT. LISTED SPECIES -- SO THEIR NUMBER PROTECTIONS ALREADY BUILT IN THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS WILL STILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE NORMAL CIVIL ENGINEERING PROCESS -- YOU'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE TO OBTAIN ANY PERMIT APPROVALS OR REVIEWS THROUGH STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. FISH AND WILDLIFE. RIGHT AS FAR AS WE CAN GO THROUGH ASHA. I MEAN WITH THE SEEK REVIEW COULD GO THROUGH ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE HABITAT AREAS IN THEORY WITHOUT. ANY IMMINENT Z. BERG THE THE WORST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES DON'T REALLY COVER THOSE THOSE ENVIRONMENTS THE SAME WAY I WOULD. I WOULD HAVE TO DEFER TO REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL FORSTER ON HOW THE FORCE PRACTICES ACT DEALS WITH THOSE BY ABOUT IT I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT. THIS ISN'T NECESSARILY CHANGING ANY OF THE OTHER SUBSTANTIVE LAWS THAT ARE OUT THERE WITH RESPECT TO PROTECTION OF THOSE WATER COURSES. SO IF THERE ARE -- PROTECTIONS IN THE FISH AND GAME FISH AND WILDLIFE CODE -- THE DEAL WITH THOSE WATER COURSES -- IN THE WATER CODE YOU'RE STILL GONNA HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THOSE. TO THEN ARE YOU GONNA HIT IMPASSES THAN IN THOSE AREAS. WHERE YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY BUILD THE EGRESS THAT YOU NEED IF IT ISN'T ASHA LET'S FLESH THAT OUT I I'M I'M VERY OPEN I DON'T MEET AT I DON'T MEAN THIS IS A? AS CRITIQUE PER SE BUT MORE JUST. TO JUST TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE GETTING HERE LIKE WHO WHO'S GONNA BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS KIND LIKE WHAT KIND OF SUBDIVISION BE ELIGIBLE WHO MIGHT BE OUT -- SO. IF AND MAYBE EVEN BRINGING DID YOU GUYS HAVE ANY REPORTS INITIALLY FROM CAL FIRE ON THIS ISSUE OF THE SORT OF STARTED TO DO THE ANALYSIS OF WHAT. MIGHT BE NEEDED SO IT'S MY TO FORCE YEAH IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THE BOARD OF FORESTRY STARTING ON THE LIST OF PROCESS FOR STREET. RIGHT THE BOARD OF FORESTRY ACT HOW FAR IS STARTING ON THIS PROCESS IT'S GOING TO BE A CASE BY CASE. SCENARIO HERE BECAUSE EVERY COMMUNITIES DIFFERENT -- IT'S NOT CLEAR HOW MANY COMMUNITIES ARE OUT THERE -- THAT WOULD NEED THIS TYPE OF ASSISTANCE. RIGHT SO THEY'RE EVALUATING IT I AM NOT AWARE THAT THEY HAVE ANY SPECIFIC EXAMPLES ARE CONCRETE RECOMMENDATIONS YET OKAY AND THEN JUST LAST DECENT PAYING FOR THE INDULGENCE BUT LOCAL COUNTY FIRE COUNTY RULES THIS IS AN S. R. A FOCUS BILL HOW DO WE HOW DO. HOW DOES IT APPLY WHO DO YOU SEE THAT PLAYING ANSWER TO NINE THE SO CAL FIRE TEAR TO ITS BOTH AS OUR A AND LOCAL RESPONSIBILITY AREAS BUT IT'S ONLY THOSE AREAS IDENTIFIED AS A VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD OKAY SO WRIT LARGE THROUGH VERY HIGH FIRE SEVERITY SENSOR THEN? YOU SEE COUNTIES THEN TAKING THE LEAD ON ON THAT THIS SORT OF NON S. ALREADY VERY HIGH. BUYERS SEVERITY POTENTIALLY. AND IF YOU AIN'T WITHIN ANY YOUR COUNTIES ARE YOU ARE DO YOU HAVE PLANS ALREADY THEY WERE YOU'RE THINKING OKAY THIS IS A REALLY DANGEROUS POCKET WE'VE GOT IT I MEAN I CAN THINK OF THEM NOW RIGHT I SO. LIKE I THINK I REMEMBER COUNTIES ARE INTERESTED -- AND THE SEE THE BENEFIT OF THIS TYPE OF SEQUEL EXEMPTION AND WHERE IT TELLS THE GAPS LEFT BY OTHER SEQUEL EXEMPTIONS. AND CENTER WE ARE HAPPY. TO WORK WITH YOU AND TAKE ANY. SUGGESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE AS THIS BILL MOVES THROUGH COMMITTEE BECAUSE AS YOU POINT OUT SPEND DOUBLE REFERRED BUT YEAH ABOUT WORD WORD WE'RE TRYING TO BE VERY THOUGHTFUL AND DELIBERATE ABOUT THE PROCESSOR. APPRECIATE. OKAY -- YOUR BROTHER THE NUMBER OF GOOD ISSUES IS THIS IS THIS BILL GOING LET'S SEE SOFT. IT'S GOING TO AND THAT'S GOING TO RESOURCES ACCESO YEAH IT IS AND IF IF YOU CAN GET. I'M SURE YOU'LL HAVE THE VOTES pPROBABLY WILL HOLD OFF TODAY AND JUST SORT OF STAY OBJECTIVE AS IT COMES TO COMMITTEE BUT I'VE NO LIKE BIG. ACTIONS HERE OKAY SELL OUT WELL SO I'VE GOT A CHANCE AND IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THERE ARE TWO LITTLE DIFFERENCES -- THAT YOU THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING VERSUS OUR STAFF ONE OF THEM WE WERE WE WOULD ADD IN LANGUAGE ABOUT CONSULTING WITH THE APPROPRIATE ENVIRONMENTAL RSOURCE SPECIALS THAT'S THAT'S ABSOLUTELY FINE. I THINK THE FIRST ONE YOU'RE ASKING FOR IS A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED FOR US -- YOU KNOW I'M. I'VE I THINK THE I MY SUGGESTION AND AND THAT'S OBVIOUSLY UP TO YOU I WOULD BE THAT WE MOVE FORWARD THE BILL TODAY PASS IT OUT. AND OUR STAFFS CONTINUE TO NEGOTIATE I ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE FACT IT'S ABOUT TO GO OVER NATURI SOURCES -- AND THAT WE YOU KNOW. I MEAN I CAN ARTICULATE YOU NOW WHAT SOME OF OUR CONCERNS ARE BUT WE CAN ALSO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AFTER THE AFTER THE HEARING -- I I I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN GET. TO TO MUTUALLY AGREEABLE LANGUAGE I'M I'M NOT SURE WHERE MORE READY TO ACCEPT WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING. WITH REGARDS TO LIMITING THE THE EXEMPTION. TO ADD TO TO THOSE SUCH ARTS ARE LIMITING THAT THE CONVERSATION OF THOSE PORTIONS OF PROJECT INVOLVING TREE REMOVAL -- BUT I I I DON'T I I THINK IT I THINK YOU'RE GIVEN THE GRANTS GIVE WHAT YOU TRY TO DO HERE WE WE OUGHT TO PASS THE BILL OUT AND AND HAVE OUR STAFFS CONTINUE TO GO SHE ATE ESPECIALLY IN AN AWESOME IN COURT. EIGHT COORDINATION WITH THE FOLKS ARE NATURAL RESOURCES THAT WOULD BE MY SUGGESTION -- I THAT WE MOVE FOR WITH THE MENS IS THE COMMITTEE'S PROPOSED AND THEN CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING. TO HONE IN ON OKAY SO TO BE CLEARED. WORD OF BECAUSE I I WAS JUST AND I APOLOGIZE I I DON'T LIKE COMING HERE NEGOTIATING LANGUAGE ON THE DíAS I PREFER TO DO IT AHEAD OF TIME SO THAT. IT'S ALL DONE AND AND I WAS FRUSTRATED. YOU KNOW THAT THAT -- IN OTHER THAT I WAS NEVER ALLOWED TO READ THAT WHAT WAS THE COMMITTEE WAS COMING UP WITH -- ON THE PROCESS SO YES IS NO WAY I PREFER TO DO IT EITHER -- SO ARE YOU PROPOSING THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE ACCEPTING ONE OF THE CHANGES BUT NOT THE OTHER WAY TO CONTINUE TALKING ABOUT EXACTLY WE'RE ACCEPTING THE SECOND CHANGE THE APPROPRIATE ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCE PROFESSIONALS THAT THE FIRST ONE WE NEED TO CONTINUE TALKING ABOUT IT WILL COORDINATE WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES STAFF AND AND THAT. CAN HAPPEN YOU CAN TAKE THOSE -- MEN'S OVER THERE RIGHT THAT'S ACCEPTABLE TO ME OKAY OKAY. GREAT I AT THE BILL'S THE MOVE BY CENTER STONE -- DO YOU KNOW WHEN IT WILL GO NATURAL RESOURCES IN THE CENTER HAS BEEN SET. THE ONLY SENSE NADA OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL THERE'S TIME THIS IS EARLY IN THE THIS EARLY IN THE PROCESS. TWO WHAT WILL HAVE YOU EVER OKAY OKAY FANTASTIC TO THE BILL'S REMOVED BY CENTER STONE I'M I'M CERTAINLY YOU COMFORTABLE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL TODAY THANK ALL THAT UNDERSTANDING. THE WORK ON ON THIS DIFFICULT IMPORTANT ISSUE -- SURGICALLY CORAL. ITEM NUMBER TWO AB THREE NINETY FOUR MOTION IS DUE PASSED AS AMENDED TO SENATE NATURAL RESOURCES AND WATER COMMITTEE. ALLEN HI ALLEN I BATES. BATES I STILL. HILL AYE SKINNER [inaudible] STERN. STONE STONE I WHITE HOUSE SKI. OKAY SO WILL WILL HOLD THAT ROLE OPEN FOR OTHER MEMBERS THAT ON BUT WE DO APPRECIATE YOUR OF YOUR WORK ON THIS AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU -- AND WE'LL HAVE SOME FURTHER CONVERSATION. OKAY I SEE JUST REMEMBER MCCARTY IS HERE -- HE'S HERE TO PRESENT ITEM FIVE IN YOUR AGENDA PACKETS MEMBERS THAT'S A. B.. EIGHT TWENTY SEVEN EIGHT TWENTY SEVEN AND NECESSARY. A BILL REALLY IN A SOLID WASTE AND RECYCLING BINS ORGANIC. WASTE -- YOU MAY PROCEED. ONE YES THANK YOU. ALL GOOD STUFF AS YOU JUST OUTLINED -- SENATOR -- FIRST THAT THANKS FOR WORKING WITH US AND WE WOULD ACCEPT THE A COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. AS PROPOSED BY YEAR AFTER NO QUESTIONS NO NEGOTIATIONS. NOT TODAY I DON'T KNOW I DON'T WANT THE OBERNOLTE TREATMENT HERE. THIS IS. YEAH. YES SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT FRANKLY YOU CAN EASILY UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO STEP UP OUR RECYCLING HERE IN CALIFORNIA. OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT RECYCLES THOSE LAWS IN THE FIRST PLACE AND GETTING THEM. A PROBE WE TAKING CARE OF IT BUT ONE OF THE ISSUES IN MAKING SURE WE HAVE A MORE -- CLEAN A SOURCE RECYCLABLES FROM THE FRONT END AND THIS IS AN ISSUE WHERE YOU PROBABLY UNDERSTANDING YOUR LIGHTS GOING. TO ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE KIDS GOING TO LET'S SAY A SUBWAY BUYING A KID'S MEAL. AND A IT COMES A LITTLE BOTTLE WATER AFTER YOU EAT THE MEAL YOU GO TO THROW A EVER ALL THE ALL THE ALL THE ALL THE ALL THE SCRAPS IN THE PAPERS IN THE BOTTLES AND THAT THE AT THE FRONT. OF THE STORE THERE'S ONLY ONE BEEN. FOR TRACK AND YOU ASKED THE CLERK HEY WHERE WHERE DO WE RECYCLE. LIKE -- WE DON'T YET TO THROW THE TRASH CAN BUT MANY THESE RECYCLING THESE RESTAURANTS DO HAVE RECYCLING IN THE BACK OF THE RESTAURANT BUT NOT IN THE FROM THE RESTAURANT SO. FRANKLY SENDS A TERRIBLE MESSAGE TO CONSUMERS AND KIDS THAT YOU THROW RECYCLING YOU THROW RECYCLABLES RIGHT IN THE TRASH CANS SO. MANY RESTAURANTS ALREADY DO THIS YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN IT AT COSTCO AND MOVIE THEATERS AND CHIPOTLE. AND NEAR BRED TO THIS IS HAS SOME OF THE OTHERS -- A STEP UP AS WELL AND SO THIS WOULD CERTAINLY HELP US WITH OUR GIGI ISSUES AND RECYCLING AND FRANKLY MORE IMPORTANTLY. FOCUS ON PROPER RECYCLING IN THE FRONT IN AND TEACH THE NEXT GENERATION OUR YOUTH HOW TO DO. IT PROPERLY I WITH ME TODAY ARE CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE AND REPUBLIC SERVICES -- ME INTRODUCE MY WITNESSES THANK. GOOD MORNING CHEN COMMITTEE MEMBERS NICK OFFICE OF CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE. THIS BILL IS A FAIRLY SIMPLE POLICY WE HAVE EXISTING LAWS ON THE BOOKS THAT REQUIRE BUSINESSES TO HAVE RECYCLING AND COMPOSTING SERVICE. THE SIMPLY SAYS THAT A BUSINESS THAT IS ALREADY REQUIRED TO HAVE THE SERVICE MUST PROVIDED TO ITS CUSTOMERS. IT REALLY TACKLES TWO SEPARATE BUT REALLY IMPORTANT PROBLEMS. FIRST IS AS THIS COMMITTEES WALL WHERE WE'RE FACING A CRISIS WITH OUR RECYCLING MARKETS. THE MATERIAL THAT WE USE TO BE ABLE TO SHIP OVERSEAS WITH FAIRLY HIGH CONTAMINANTS. I THOSE COUNTRIES NO LONGER WANT AND THAT'S FORCING US TO RE LOOK AT THE ENTIRE CYCLING SYSTEM. PART OF THAT IS THE CHAIRS BILL ABOUT PRODUCT REDESIGN. AND SOURCE REDUCTION PART OF IT IS MARKET DEVELOPMENT BUT ALSO PART OF IT IS CLEANER SOURCE SEPARATION. TO GIVING. GIVING CUSTOMERS AND RESIDENTS IN AND CONSUMERS OPPORTUNITY TO PUT THINGS IN SEPARATE BINS. BEFORE THEY GET COMMINGLED SO THAT THE COMMODITIES ARE CLEANER THEY'RE EASIER TO SELL THEM MORE VALUE. THE SECOND THING THE BILL ACCOMPLISHES. IS. MOVING FORWARD WHERE FOCUS ON ORGANICS DIVERSION AND COMPOSTING. AND AGAIN THAT'S ANOTHER. ISSUE IT'S GONNA HAVE A LOT OF MULTIPLE FACETS INCLUDING. MARKET DEVELOPMENT INFRASTRUCTURE AT CETERA. BUT A PART OF THAT IS ENSURING THAT CONSUMERS HAVE ACCESS. TO ORGANICS RECYCLING. WHERE THEY WORK WHERE THEY GO OUT TO EAT WHERE THEY LIVE? AND THAT IS CONSISTENT ACROSS THE BOARD SO THAT YOU SORT F GET IN THE HABIT OF A BANANA PEEL DOESN'T GO IN THE TRASH CANS. OF ANNA KILL GOES IN THE OTHER BEEN. AND UNLESS WE HAVE THAT KIND OF CONSISTENT SYSTEM ACROSS THE BOARD. IT JUST WON'T WORK WHEN WE DROP OFF BINS OF PEOPLE'S HOUSES AND THEY HAVE NO IDEA. WHAT TO DO WITH THEM -- THAT ASSN AYE BOAT THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARKHAM PRAY OUT WITH A FRIEND THE KELLY ON BEHALF OF REPUBLIC SERVICES -- WE ARE ARE HAPPY TO SUPPORT BY THIS MEASURE AND WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS REALLY FROM TWO PERSPECTIVES. OPERATIONALLY AND COST PRESSURES. AS YOU ARE ALL WELL AWARE -- CHINA SOARED AND IT'S MUCH LOWER CONTAMINATION STANDARDS HAVE CAUSED A LOT OF SOLID WASTE THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY RECYCLED TO BE REJECTED. AND THERE AREN'T MARKETS FOR RECYCLED MATERIALS. SECONDLY IS THAT IT IS -- AS A RESULT OF THAT THERE IS A PRESSURE -- TO PROVIDE -- GREATER -- RECYCLED CONTENT INTERCLUB SKEWS ME. THERE IS A IS A GREATER PRESSURE -- TO LOOK AT PROVIDING THE LESS CONTAMINATION IN THE BILLS THAT ARE BEING SOLD. AND WITH THE ADVENT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE A NEED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OR OF ORGANIC RECYCLING -- IN TAKING THAT OUT OF LANDFILLS AS A RESULT THERE IS INCREASING PRESSURE ON SOLID WASTE OPERATORS TO SLOW THE SYSTEM WHICH RESULTS IN HIGHER COSTS. IF SOLID WASTE COULD BE A BETTER SOURCE SEPARATED THOSE -- PRESSURES WOULD NOT BE ELIMINATED BUT WOULD BE REDUCED AND SO WE'RE LOOKING AT IT FROM A STANDPOINT THAT OPERATORS HAVE A MUCH GREATER BURDEN IN TERMS OF GETTING TO A LOWER -- CONTAMINATION RATE BUT ALSO AS A RESULT OF THAT THEIR HIGHER COST PRESSURES OR COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS ON OUR RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS AND ULTIMATELY ON THE MUNICIPALITIES WHO FRANCHISE OR SOLID WASTE FOR THOSE REASONS WERE ASKING. FOR IN THE SAME ISSUES THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH ON AND OTHER LEGISLATION. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU OUR FOLKS ONE ADD ON SUPPORT. THERESA BURKE RICH ON BEHALF OF THE LOCAL DMINISTRATORS OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH IN THE CALIFORNIA COMPOST COALITION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. EVERY THINK WASTE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. FLORA COME ON BEHALF OF SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT ALL RIGHT. I ANYONE ELSE ANYONE WANTS TO RAISE CONCERNS ARE OPPOSITION. YES SIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU MISTER TURN MEMBERS MET CERTAIN THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION. DEFINITELY APPRECIATE THE SPIRIT OF THE BILL AND THE NOTION OF CAPTURING THOSE RECYCLABLE MATERIALS WHETHER THEIR FOOD WASTE OR YOU KNOW PLASTIC BOTTLES -- AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE OF WHAT WE'VE EXPRESSED FROM THE BEGINNING IS THAT WE ARE SO INCREDIBLY INVOLVED ON THE CAL RECYCLE SIDE MAJOR LEGISLATION THAT THIS HOUSE AND BOTH HOUSES IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED SB. THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE WHICH HAS A REGULATORY STRUCTURE UNDER WAY RIGHT NOW WHICH IN SHORT OUT OF INTEREST OF YOUR TIME GETS US TO THE SAME GOALS BY. TWENTY TWENTY TWO WERE INVOLVED IN THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS. IN THAT PROCESS AND IN THAT PROCESS THERE'S A LOT OF LOCAL CONTROL ELEMENTS WHICH ARE VERY HELPFUL. AND SPECIFICALLY WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FOOD WASTE AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SORT OF BLUE BEEN STUFF I GUESS WE'LL CALL IT -- IN SO BOTH OF THOSE ARE GOING TO BE REQUIRED UNDER SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE REGULATIONS AND IN THOSE REGULATIONS THERE ARE -- FLEXIBILITY AS IF NOT WAIVERS FOR SITUATIONS WHERE YOU HAVE LIMITED SPACE IN A RESTAURANTS BECAUSE KEEP IN MIND MOST OF OUR RESTAURANTS AT THE INDEPENDENT RESTAURANTS NOT THE CHAINS MENTIONED. AND WE DON'T HAVE CONTROL OF OUR PHYSICAL FOOTPRINT AND SO SOMETIMES WE CANNOT GROW AND WE HAVE THAT LIMITED BUT PRINT. AND SO THE LOCAL OF FLEXIBILITY THAT IS IN THE REGULATIONS ACCOMMODATES THAT SORT OF THING TO BE DEVELOPED AND DETERMINED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- AND IN ADDITION TO THAT -- SORRY THERE'S A DE MINIMUS WAIVER SO IF YOU HAVE A WHAT'S DEEMED AS A REALLY SMALL AMOUNT OF ORGANIC WASTE -- THAN THAT TOO CAN BE ACCOMMODATED OR WAVE BUT TRUST THE REAL BIG DEAL IS WHEN YOU HAVE THE SPACE LIMITATIONS. CAN YOU GET SOME FLEXIBILITY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO THAT WE CAN COMPLY WITH THE SPIRIT OF WHAT'S HERE. AND THE REGULATIONS OFFER A A LONGER TIME FRAME TO TO GET TO THIS POINT BY. TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO I THINK I SHORT ASK WOULD BE I IS THERE I THINK THERE'S A SWEET SPOT IN IS THERE A WAY TO HAVE THIS BILL. A LINE WITH THE REGULATIONS IN TERMS OF TIMELINE AND IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE LOCAL FLEXIBILITY THE TOP. THINK ABOUT WHAT ONE STAY FOR SECULAR. LET ANYONE ARE YOU ONE OUT ON IN OPPOSITION. CONCERNS OKAY COME ON IT IS REAL QUICK -- DOES HERE ON BEHALF OF WESTERN -- WASTE MANAGEMENT THIRTY WESTERN UP FASTER WASTE MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY WE DON'T HAVE A FOR A POSITION RIGHT NOW CURRENTLY BUT WE DO HAVE CONCERNS AT THIS MAY CONFLICT. WITH OUR CURRENT MAKES BASED SITE. AS CURRENTLY ALLOWED ONE AB THREE FORTY ONE FOR HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE AS WELL. SENT TO MAYBE GET -- TO SOME SORT OF LIKE. THREE POINT THAT WE CAN GET SOME AMENDMENTS THAT ARE CLARIFYING. THE TAKE ANY OPPOSITION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE CONCERNS. OKAY YES FOR THE COMMITTEE I LOVE -- TO BEFORE WE GET OPEN UP TO THE REST THE MEMBERS -- CAN YOU SPEAK TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT -- MISTER SUTTON AS AS REYES. I GUESS THE BOTTOM LINE IS YES WE WE ARE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION -- YOU KNOW MANY OTHER MEMBERS THIS IS AN UNNATURAL FOR THEM YOU'RE DOING IT BUT THEY DO RAISE ISSUES AT THE RESTAURANT SCENE IN CALIFORNIA. IS QUITE. AND SO -- THEY HAVE -- BOWS UNLESS AMENDED SO. WE'RE COMMITTED TO TRYING. TO CENTURY OR NAY WITH THE GOALS OF ORGANIC SO. THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE AND ON GOING PROCESS. I THINK THAT THE INTENT OF THE THE LETTER THAT WAS SUBMITTED BY MISTER SUTTON. IS CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT OF THE SPONSOR AND THE AUTHOR. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO RUN THE TRAPS ON THE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE IS EITHER ANY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES? BUT THAT REALLY THEY'LL GOAL WAS TO HAVE THE SUPPLY TO THE BUSINESSES THAT ALREADY SUBJECT. EIGHTEEN TWENTY SIX AND THREE FORTY ONE IT DOESN'T NOT INTENDED TO TOUCH THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE BUSINESSES BETTER REGULATIONS BEING DEVELOPER NOW. I'M AND ADDITIONALLY THERE ARE EXISTING EXEMPTIONS IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY SIX AND THREE FORTY ONE WE DID INTEND TO APPLY HERE. SO WE'RE HAVING ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WE DON'T DISAGREE. IN SPIRIT WITH THAT RESTAURANTS ASSOCIATIONS [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. OKAY YEAH. HOUSE DID YOU WANNA ASK QUESTIONS. I HAD A QUESTION ON THE BACK OF THE HOUSE NOT THE FRIEND PASSED ON THE COMMERCIAL. WE ALL THEM FULL SERVICE RESTAURANTS. SOME OF THOSE FULL SERVICE RESTAURANTS ARE STILL REQUIRED TO DO ORGANIC. SORTING RIGHT THE BACK IN THE BACK OF HOUSE OKAY. THIS MIGHT BE A THIRD FROM THE HOW OLD IS IS THE ONES THAT NOT TO SIT DOWN REST. ONE THREE TO GET UP AND GO. TO HAVE THOSE SAME TYPE OF EFFORT YOU HAVE IN THE BACK. THERE ARE YOU ALREADY HAVE A ON BACK ANYWAY. MY WITH BUT OKAY COME OUT AND SERVICE AND SO THE NOTION IS IT IT'S ALREADY THERE THIS IS. AWESOME. AND IF THE OBJECTION I HAVEN'T SEEN THE THE LETTER OF CAPTION IT'S STRICTLY FOR THE FROM THE HOUSE AFTER THE BACK OF HOUSE. THAT IS TO SENATOR AND AND THE THE CRUX OF THE OBJECTION IS MORE CAN WE ALIGN WITH WHAT'S BEING DONE IT CARRY CYCLE RIGHT NOW AND THE OTHER ISSUE THAT DOES COME UP. THAT I THINK WE CAN ALL RELATE TO IS THAT YOU KNOW THERE ARE AREAS OF THE STATE THAT EVEN UNDER EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS DON'T HAVE THESE ORGANIC SERVICES. AND IN THE EXISTING REGULATIONS THERE SOME FLEXIBILITY THAT WE'RE NOT. JUST BECAUSE THE LANDLORD WON'T LET US DO IT WERE BECAUSE THERE'S NOT THE ACTUAL SERVICE. SO A LOT OF THIS IS JUST TRYING TO GET. THAT DRESS PRESS THANK YOU. AND WITH THAT ISSUE WE DO KNOW THERE ARE SOME AREAS ESPECIALLY RURAL AREAS. THAT THERE IS A PROCESS FOR YOU CAN BUY [inaudible] FOR AN EXEMPTION [inaudible] SO. WE'D BE WILLING TO HAVE THAT. OKAY ALL RIGHT I THINK. WE WE CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE THIS THIS -- THIS CONTAIN DISCUSSION WE DON'T WANT TO YOU KNOW. ULTIMATELY. I WANT TO MARRY THAT EXISTING REGULATORY. PROCESS IN PLACE WITH WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO I THINK.
