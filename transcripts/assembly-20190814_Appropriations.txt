COMPARED TO THE COST OF SOMEBODY GOING TO A PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALIZATIONS WHO'S OVER A THOUSAND DOLLARS. ONLY REFERRING SOMEBODY TO A SELF HELP SUPPORT GROUP IN THE COMMUNITY THROUGH THE USE OF PEERS CUTS RE HOSPITALIZATION BY 50% AND IN RESPONSE TO THE FISCAL ANALYSIS BY THE COMMITTEE AGAIN.

MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THIS ADDRESSES. ISSUE THAT'S. COME TO OUR ATTENTION WITH THESE CHARACTER PRESIDENT FIRES THAT WE'VE HAD TO DEAL WITH. IT REQUIRES AN ELECTRICAL CORPORATION TO INCLUDE IN ITS WILDLIFE AND WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLAN. AND NOT A NOTE I CONSIDER INCLUDE WILD LIFE BECAUSE THEY ARE AFFECTED BY THESE FIRES TO. THEY WOULD HAVE TO CONSIDER UNDERGROUND ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION LINES ALSO IN THE AREAS THAT ARE OF THE HIGHEST RISK. THE PROBLEM THAT WE'VE HAD MOST OFTEN HAS BEEN ABOVE GROUND TRANSMISSION. LIGHTS SELLER THESE TOWERS. THAT HAVE STARTED THESE FIRES. AND UNDER GROUNDING IS A MORE SECURE WAY TO DO IT AND WE'RE SIMPLY ASKING THAT THEY WOULD EXAMINE. AND REPORT AND PURSUE THAT OPTION IF IT IS APPLICATIONS. THE RESIDENTS TO CALIFORNIA I THINK WOULD RATHER SEE THIS OF THE PUBLIC NOW HAS BECOME MORE ACUTELY AWARE OF THESE. ABOVE GROUND. SOURCES OF THE FIRES. AND THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT. AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT WITHOUT WOOD WHO GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT THE F. B. ELECTRICAL COMPANIES DO NEED TO HARDEN THEIR- DELIVERY SYSTEMS. THE REFERENCE CHECKS YOUR. AND THIS IS A GOOD WAY TO DO IT. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE COSTS ARE OF SOME CONSIDERATION. BUT THE COST OF THESE DEVASTATING FIRES. OUR OF MORE CONSIDERATION AND THE JEOPARDY OF LIFE'S THE PROPERTY. AND SOCIETAL COST. A GREATER. RATE PAYERS ARE ALREADY BEARING THE BURDEN OF SOME OF THE IN ATTENTION OVER THE DECADES. AND WE NEED TO TAKE STEPS TO MINIMIZE THAT IN THE FUTURE. UNDER GROUNDING IS NOT JUST AN INVESTMENT IN A RELIABLE INFRASTRUCTURE BUT IT IS INVESTMENT IN THE LIVES. AND AVOIDED COSTS WHICH IS A BIG ISSUE AND ELECTRICAL DRUG DELIVERY. WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE UTILITIES TO TAKE THESE ACTIONS THE PART OF THE ONGOING PLAN. TO HARDEN AND GREATER PROTECT US. IN OUR COMMUNITIES FROM THESE DEVASTATING FIRES I WOULD ASK AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU ARE THERE SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT. SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.
