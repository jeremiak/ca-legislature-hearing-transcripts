A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. IT'S

00:10:27.026 --> 00:10:28.894
IMPERATIVE THAT WE FULLY

THAT THE CONDITIONS NEED TO BE

00:10:47.513 --> 00:10:49.515
BETTER DEFINED IN LIGHT OF

00:10:49.582 --> 00:10:50.449
THINGS LIKE THE SHOREBIRD

00:10:50.516 --> 00:10:52.418
CONSERVATION PROGRAMS LAST

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:53.886

ACCESS WHICH WE NEED TO

00:10:55.888 --> 00:10:57.890
CONTINUE AND THESE

00:10:57.957 --> 00:10:59.125
CONVERSATIONS ARE ABOUT MUCH

00:10:59.191 --> 00:11:02.661
MORE THAN JUST ALWAYS BE AXLES.

00:11:02.728 --> 00:11:05.431
AND MAYBE TO PUT A FINER. POINT

00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:08.434
ON IT- DOES THAT BECAUSE THE

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:11.504
SAN LUIS OBISPO PAPERS ALREADY

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:13.339

SOMETHING THAT'S NOT IN THERE.

00:11:24.216 --> 00:11:25.651
BUT THEIR DIRECTION AT THIS

00:11:25.718 --> 00:11:28.621

00:11:37.997 --> 00:11:39.498
ISSUE AMONG WHICH THEY PUT

00:11:39.565 --> 00:11:43.135
FORWARD. BY DIRECTED AND IT IS

00:11:43.202 --> 00:11:44.670
CURRENTLY THE ONLY WAY TO GAIN

00:11:44.737 --> 00:11:46.572
ACCESS INTO THE OCEANIA REGIONS

00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:49.842

OPERATIONS CENTER AND SPENT THE

00:14:55.527 --> 00:14:57.062
DAY AT THE BIG BASS IN HER

00:14:57.129 --> 00:15:00.032
QUARTERS. UP WHILE THE PARK WAS

00:15:00.099 --> 00:15:04.036

THE HIGHEST. THAT THE FIRST

00:15:12.511 --> 00:15:13.846
PART OF YOUR QUESTION WHICH IS

00:15:13.912 --> 00:15:15.814
BIZARRE AXLES. WHEN THERE'S A

00:15:15.881 --> 00:15:18.617
DEVASTATING FIRE- IN A FORESTED

00:15:18.684 --> 00:15:21.220
AREA ONE OF THE FACTS IS THAT A

00:15:21.287 --> 00:15:23.656
LOT OF THOSE TREES OR WEAKENED.

00:15:23.722 --> 00:15:25.924
AND ACTUALLY. FALL IN CREATING

00:15:25.991 --> 00:15:28.694
EXTRAORDINARY HAZARD- STATE

00:15:28.761 --> 00:15:29.962
PARKS IS ALTHOUGH WE'VE ALREADY

00:15:30.029 --> 00:15:32.364
SPENT. THREE MILLION DOLLARS

00:15:32.431 --> 00:15:35.034
MOVING RECALL HAS BEEN TRIMS

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:35.968
JUST ALONG THE ROADS THROUGH

00:15:36.035 --> 00:15:38.671
THE PARK. AND WE CONTINUE TO BE

00:15:38.737 --> 00:15:41.307
LOOKING AT SAFETY HAZARDS WHICH

00:15:41.373 --> 00:15:44.076
IS OUR PRIMARY CONCERN BEFORE

00:15:44.143 --> 00:15:46.011
VISITORS CAN VISIT THE PARK.

00:15:46.078 --> 00:15:47.346
AND SO THE TIME AT WHICH THE

00:15:47.413 --> 00:15:48.547
PARK WILL BE OPEN FOR PEOPLE TO

00:15:48.614 --> 00:15:50.849
EVEN SEE THINGS ITS USE-

00:15:50.916 --> 00:15:53.218
RECENTLY- IS STILL OUT ON THE

00:15:53.285 --> 00:15:54.853
HORIZON I DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC

00:15:54.920 --> 00:16:00.959
DATE. BUT REALLY THE CLOSURE IS.

00:16:01.026 --> 00:16:01.927
DUE TO VISIT OUR SAFETY. WE

00:16:01.994 --> 00:16:04.897
IMMEDIATE ASSUME. TEAM POST

00:16:04.963 --> 00:16:05.998
FIRE TO START THINKING ABOUT.

00:16:06.065 --> 00:16:08.067
HOW DO WE READ THIS FIRST STATE

00:16:08.133 --> 00:16:11.770
PARK IT WAS JUST. AND WE PUT

00:16:11.837 --> 00:16:14.039
OUR HEADS TOGETHER AND REALLY

00:16:14.106 --> 00:16:15.507
WHAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

00:16:15.574 --> 00:16:18.377
DO IS REBUILD A STATE PARK WHAT

00:16:18.444 --> 00:16:20.346
IS FUTURE. WHAT IS A STATE PARK

00:16:20.412 --> 00:16:22.247
LOOK LIKE IN THE CENTURY WE

00:16:22.314 --> 00:16:23.816
KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO INCLUDE

00:16:23.882 --> 00:16:26.285
SUSTAINABLE THE SIGNS. ARE WE

00:16:26.352 --> 00:16:27.219
PUTTING INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE

00:16:27.286 --> 00:16:29.655
RIGHT PLACE. UTILITIES HOW CAN

00:16:29.722 --> 00:16:31.523
WE PLACE THESE TO PROTECT THE

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:33.192
RESOURCES BUT ALSO PROVIDE

00:16:33.258 --> 00:16:36.962
SERVICES. FOR THE PUBLIC THAT'S

00:16:37.029 --> 00:16:38.430
VISITING UP. WE ARE LOOKING AT

00:16:38.497 --> 00:16:40.733
OVERALL PLANNING AS WE PLAN THE

00:16:40.799 --> 00:16:42.768
PARK HAVING TO DO WITH HABITAT

00:16:42.835 --> 00:16:44.636
AND BIODIVERSITY MANAGEMENT.

00:16:44.703 --> 00:16:46.138
AND WE ALSO NEED TO BE THINKING

00:16:46.205 --> 00:16:48.140
OF A PARK THAT IS ACCESSIBLE

00:16:48.207 --> 00:16:49.541
FOR ALL AND AS WE'VE SEEN WITH

00:16:49.608 --> 00:16:51.110
KOBE WE KNOW THAT THERE'S GOING

00:16:51.176 --> 00:16:52.411
TO BE MORE VISITORS THAN THERE

00:16:52.478 --> 00:16:54.546
HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST VIRTUALLY

00:16:54.613 --> 00:16:57.750
ALL THE PARKS. SO ALL OF THOSE

00:16:57.816 --> 00:16:58.317
THINGS ARE GUIDING NATIONAL

00:16:58.384 --> 00:17:00.819
JUST. AB IS A QUICKLY AND THAT.

00:17:00.886 --> 00:17:03.122
ARE PART TEAMS HAVE ALREADY.

00:17:03.188 --> 00:17:05.657
PUT TOGETHER A BASIC. FRAMEWORK

00:17:05.724 --> 00:17:06.225
OF A PLAN I THINK OF IT IS

00:17:06.291 --> 00:17:08.060
SETTING THE TABLE. FOR WORKING

00:17:08.127 --> 00:17:09.928
WITH OUR PARTNERS AND WE'RE

00:17:09.995 --> 00:17:11.897
PREPARING TO DO A PUBLIC

00:17:11.964 --> 00:17:13.799
ENGAGEMENT PROCESS AS LITERALLY

00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:16.235
AS WE REIMAGINE. WHAT THE BIG

00:17:16.301 --> 00:17:17.770
BASS AND FOR THE NEXT CENTURY

00:17:17.836 --> 00:17:19.872
IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE. AND I

00:17:19.938 --> 00:17:22.341
HAVE TO SAY THAT I'M REALLY

00:17:22.408 --> 00:17:24.410
EXCITED ABOUT. BEING ABLE TO

00:17:24.476 --> 00:17:26.044
WORK ON THE RECOVERY OF THIS

00:17:26.111 --> 00:17:28.213
EXTRAORDINARY PLACE. AT THE

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.182
SAME TIME POTENTIALLY BE

00:17:30.249 --> 00:17:32.317
SETTING NEW STANDARDS. IN TERMS

00:17:32.384 --> 00:17:34.753
OF HOW WE LOOK. AT WHAT PARTS

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.622
NEED TO BE HELD PARTS NEED TO

00:17:36.688 --> 00:17:40.025
BE MANAGED AND TAKEN CARE OF

00:17:40.092 --> 00:17:41.627
GOING INTO THE NEXT CENTURY.

00:17:41.693 --> 00:17:42.428
WITH YOUR QUESTION REGARDING

00:17:42.494 --> 00:17:44.930

SOURCES TO HELP. ADVANCE THE

00:17:55.541 --> 00:17:56.942
WORK THAT WE'RE DOING AND I CAN

00:17:57.009 --> 00:17:59.745
ALSO SAY THAT ARE PART PARTNERS

00:17:59.812 --> 00:18:00.712
IN SEEING THE WORK THAT WE'VE

00:18:00.779 --> 00:18:02.181
ALREADY STARTED ARE ALREADY

00:18:02.247 --> 00:18:03.849
FUND RAISING TO PARK IT WAS

00:18:03.916 --> 00:18:06.618
PARKS AS WE REBUILD THIS FIRST

00:18:06.685 --> 00:18:08.921
STATE PART. OF THE FIRST BIG

00:18:08.987 --> 00:18:10.956
PART IN THE STATE PARK SYSTEM

00:18:11.023 --> 00:18:14.626
THANK YOU THAT WAS VERY HELPFUL

00:18:14.693 --> 00:18:16.094
AND THERE ARE PEOPLE. OF LOCAL

00:18:16.161 --> 00:18:17.930
YOU'RE VERY INTERESTED IN JUST

00:18:17.996 --> 00:18:20.265
GETTING IN WHEN IT IS SAFE

00:18:20.332 --> 00:18:21.934
BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY THINK THEY

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.769
CAN EVEN HELP RAISE MONEY SO

00:18:23.836 --> 00:18:26.171
THAT'S AN- IMPORTANT THING. I

00:18:26.238 --> 00:18:27.706
HAD A CUTTING EDGE I HAD A

00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:28.774
COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ON THE

00:18:28.841 --> 00:18:32.377
BUDGET A. M. ONE IS THAT. THE

00:18:32.444 --> 00:18:34.346
FIRST MAJOR SIGNIFICANT

00:18:34.413 --> 00:18:35.948
ADDITIONAL REVENUE TO THE PARK

00:18:36.014 --> 00:18:37.549
SYSTEM CAME FROM THE

00:18:37.616 --> 00:18:41.153
TRANSPORTATION PROPOSAL. AND IT

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:41.787
WAS SIXTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS

00:18:41.854 --> 00:18:44.356
A YEAR. A HAVE YOU INVESTED

00:18:44.423 --> 00:18:45.491
THAT AND THAT HASN'T BEEN

00:18:45.557 --> 00:18:47.226
OFFSET BY ANY CUT IN THE

00:18:47.292 --> 00:18:49.428
GENERAL FUND DRIVE THAT IS A

00:18:49.495 --> 00:18:52.097
SIXTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR MOVE

00:18:52.164 --> 00:18:52.664
AHEAD IN THE PARKS BUDGET.

00:18:52.731 --> 00:18:54.066
THAT'S CORRECT INITIALLY WE

00:18:54.132 --> 00:18:55.234
THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.401
EIGHTY BUT THAT WAS A MISTAKE

00:18:56.468 --> 00:18:57.803
IT IS SIXTY EIGHT MILLION AND

00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:59.738
IT IS NOT BEING UP. THERE ISN'T

00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:01.173
ANYTHING COMING OUT OF OUR BASE

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:02.774
BUDGET AS A RESULT OF THAT

00:19:02.841 --> 00:19:05.143
OPPORTUNITY. AND WHAT KINDS OF

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:06.578
THINGS ARE YOU ABLE TO DO THAT

00:19:06.645 --> 00:19:08.714
YOU WEREN'T DOING BEFORE NOW

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:10.115
THAT YOU HAVE THE FIRST BIGGEST

00:19:10.182 --> 00:19:12.084
SLUG OF ADDITIONAL MONEY IN.

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:14.520
RECENT YEARS. WELL IT'S AN

00:19:14.586 --> 00:19:16.755
EXCITING PROSPECT WHAT WE DID

00:19:16.822 --> 00:19:20.225
IS WE LOOKED IT UP- FILLING

00:19:20.292 --> 00:19:21.126
THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR

00:19:21.193 --> 00:19:22.728
ADDITIONAL POSITIONS WE'VE

00:19:22.794 --> 00:19:24.396
ALREADY FILLED TWO THIRDS OF

00:19:24.463 --> 00:19:26.265
THOSE POSITIONS. MOST OF US

00:19:26.331 --> 00:19:27.933
AREN'T MAINTENANCE AND WITH

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.101
CODE AND THE OTHER THINGS THAT

00:19:29.167 --> 00:19:30.769
HAVE HAPPENED THAT WORK IS SLOW

00:19:30.836 --> 00:19:33.305
DOWN. BUT WE ARE LOOKING TO

00:19:33.372 --> 00:19:35.107
OBLIGATE ALL OF THOSE FUNDS IN

00:19:35.173 --> 00:19:37.142
THE NEAR FUTURE. AND THAT LEADS

00:19:37.209 --> 00:19:38.443
TO THE QUESTION ON DEFERRED

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:40.078
MAINTENANCE SO WHAT'S THE

00:19:40.145 --> 00:19:44.249
BALANCE OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

00:19:44.316 --> 00:19:44.783
IN THE PARK SYSTEM AT THIS

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:46.151
POINT. WELL FOR DEFERRED

00:19:46.218 --> 00:19:49.254
MAINTENANCE WE ARE LOOKING AT-

00:19:49.321 --> 00:19:51.657
BEING ABLE TO INVEST. TWENTY

00:19:51.723 --> 00:19:53.125
MILLION DOLLARS IN IN OUR

00:19:53.191 --> 00:19:55.627
CURRENT BUDGET PASS. AND WHAT

00:19:55.694 --> 00:19:57.496
WE'VE DONE WITH REGARDS TO THE

00:19:57.563 --> 00:19:59.998
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. IS A FEW

00:20:00.065 --> 00:20:00.966
YEARS AGO WE WORK WITH THE

00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:02.901
STATE PARKS COMMISSION

00:20:02.968 --> 00:20:04.236
ESTABLISHED FRAMEWORK THE

00:20:04.303 --> 00:20:06.471
PRIORITIES OF A PRIORITY SAME

00:20:06.538 --> 00:20:09.575
PROCESS RATHER- AND THE PROJECT

00:20:09.641 --> 00:20:11.476
SELECTION CITERIA INCLUDES

00:20:11.543 --> 00:20:12.978
GLORIFIED ASPECTS OF HEALTH AND

00:20:13.045 --> 00:20:15.247
SAFETY. FEASIBILITY AND

00:20:15.314 --> 00:20:16.882
PERMITTING CRITICALITY

00:20:16.949 --> 00:20:18.417
OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES AND

00:20:18.483 --> 00:20:20.519
SAVING AND CODE COMPLIANCE AND

00:20:20.586 --> 00:20:22.187
WHEN THESE ARE EVALUATED TO GET

00:20:22.254 --> 00:20:25.557
MENTAL MERICLE SCHOOL. AND WE

00:20:25.624 --> 00:20:26.992
THOUGHT IT WAS. FOR ORDER KEEP

00:20:27.059 --> 00:20:29.328
DANCE TO LOWEST AND WE HAVE

00:20:29.394 --> 00:20:31.430
BEEN PREPARING FOR IS BEING

00:20:31.496 --> 00:20:32.965
ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

00:20:33.031 --> 00:20:35.233
FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES SO EVERY

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:36.768
TIME WE LOOK AT A PROJECT GET

00:20:36.835 --> 00:20:38.337
IT COULD THROUGH THE SCORING

00:20:38.403 --> 00:20:39.605
PROCESS AND IT'S ADDED TO THE

00:20:39.671 --> 00:20:43.008
LIST. AND OUR IDEA IS THAT

00:20:43.075 --> 00:20:45.611
SHOULD WE ARE. OPPORTUNITY

00:20:45.677 --> 00:20:47.879
ARISE THAT WE GET FUNDING FOR A

00:20:47.946 --> 00:20:49.147
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DOLLARS WE

00:20:49.214 --> 00:20:49.982
KNOW THAT WE'RE GONNA BE

00:20:50.048 --> 00:20:51.717
PREPARED WITH PROJECTS THAT ARE

00:20:51.783 --> 00:20:53.986
READY TO GO WHETHER IT'S- A

00:20:54.052 --> 00:20:56.455
SINGLE GET A SINGLE. PROJECT

00:20:56.521 --> 00:20:59.024
VALUE OF INCOME OR FUNDING

00:20:59.091 --> 00:21:01.159
RATHER FOR A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT

00:21:01.226 --> 00:21:03.996
OF INCOME OR FUNDING AND WE

00:21:04.062 --> 00:21:05.998
HAVE THESE PROJECTS GO. AND

00:21:06.064 --> 00:21:07.499
READY TO GO AND THEY DO CHANGE

00:21:07.566 --> 00:21:08.967
A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE SOMETIMES

00:21:09.034 --> 00:21:10.369
FUNDING COMES AND IT TAKES CARE

00:21:10.435 --> 00:21:12.104
OF A PROJECT UNLESS. SOMETIMES

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:13.739
A NEW PROJECT GETS EVALUATED

00:21:13.805 --> 00:21:16.575
MOST OF THE TOP OF THE LIST. SO

00:21:16.642 --> 00:21:18.510
IT'S A IT'S A MOVING TARGET BUT

00:21:18.577 --> 00:21:21.713
WE ARE. POISED I THANK YOU TAKE

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:24.182
ADVANTAGE OF STREAMS OF FUNDING

00:21:24.249 --> 00:21:25.651
THAT COULD REALLY MAKE A DENT

00:21:25.717 --> 00:21:27.519
IN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE I

00:21:27.586 --> 00:21:29.688
APPRECIATE THAT. I HAVE SOME

00:21:29.755 --> 00:21:31.590
VAGUE KNOWLEDGE OF THAT

00:21:31.657 --> 00:21:34.026
PRIORITIES ARE SETTING PROCESS

00:21:34.092 --> 00:21:36.828
FROM HERE THERE WAS A TIME WHEN

00:21:36.895 --> 00:21:37.996
THERE WERE ESTIMATES OF HOW

LEGAL FRAMEWORK UNDER STATE

00:29:13.718 --> 00:29:15.854
LAW. TO HAVE PARTNERS FOR

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.389
INDIVIDUAL PARKS BE FORMALLY

00:29:18.456 --> 00:29:21.860
RECOGNIZED AND- THAT WAS A DON

00:29:21.926 --> 00:29:26.097
AND THE M. AS IN THE- UNTIL

00:29:26.164 --> 00:29:27.232
SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS GO PARKS

00:29:27.298 --> 00:29:28.299
DIDN'T ACCOUNT FOR HOW MUCH

00:29:28.366 --> 00:29:30.235
EACH INDIVIDUAL PART COST IT

00:29:30.301 --> 00:29:31.736
WAS ONLY BY REGION AND SO YOU

00:29:31.803 --> 00:29:32.837
COULD IF YOU WANT TO HELP AN

00:29:32.904 --> 00:29:34.072
INDIVIDUAL PARK YOU COULD

00:29:34.139 --> 00:29:35.507
FIGURE IT OUT BECAUSE YOU CAN

00:29:35.573 --> 00:29:37.275
FIGURE OU. HOW MUCH IT COST.

00:29:37.342 --> 00:29:38.977
SO WHAT'S THE STATUS OF THE

00:29:39.043 --> 00:29:40.845
ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO FORM

00:29:40.912 --> 00:29:45.216
INDIVIDUAL PARK. GROUPS FOR

00:29:45.283 --> 00:29:45.717
PARK AT THIS POINT. YOU

00:29:45.783 --> 00:29:46.618
INCLUDED SEVERAL THINGS THAT

00:29:46.684 --> 00:29:47.785
QUESTION LET ME JUST SAY ONE

00:29:47.852 --> 00:29:48.953
THING BEFORE I ANSWER THE REST

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:50.522
OF IT AND THAT IS THAT- I

00:29:50.588 --> 00:29:52.123
UNDERSTAND THAT IF YOU COULDN'T

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:54.325
TELL. HOW A BUDGET WAS BEING

00:29:54.392 --> 00:29:56.661
ALLOCATED WITHIN A DISTRICT-

00:29:56.728 --> 00:29:58.029
BUT TODAY WITH SERVICE BASED

00:29:58.096 --> 00:30:00.131
BUDGETING YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE

00:30:00.198 --> 00:30:01.299
WHERE MONEY IS GOING TO A

00:30:01.366 --> 00:30:04.536
PROJECT. TO PARK TO DISTRICT SO

00:30:04.602 --> 00:30:06.137
THAT SORT OF FINANCIAL TRACKING

00:30:06.204 --> 00:30:07.438
HIS IN PLACE AND AGAIN THAT'S

00:30:07.505 --> 00:30:10.208
DUE TO SERVICE. UP SERVICE

00:30:10.275 --> 00:30:12.810
BASED BUDGETING. AND THE

00:30:12.877 --> 00:30:15.813
RELATIVE TO- PART PARTNERS. AND

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.448
PARKS THERE'S A COUPLE OF

00:30:17.515 --> 00:30:19.984
DISTINCTIONS. OF ONE OF THEM IS

00:30:20.051 --> 00:30:22.320
THAT- ANY PARK CAN HAVE A PARK

00:30:22.387 --> 00:30:25.056
PARKER. THAT RAISES MONEY FOR

00:30:25.123 --> 00:30:26.124
THE MINUTE MIGHT BE A SMALL

00:30:26.191 --> 00:30:28.126
LOCAL GROUP. OF WHICH THAT

00:30:28.193 --> 00:30:30.028
EXIST ALL OVER THE STATE WHERE

00:30:30.094 --> 00:30:31.462
IT CAN BE A RELATIVELY SMALL

00:30:31.529 --> 00:30:33.298
GROUP THAT DOES FUNDRAISERS OF

00:30:33.364 --> 00:30:35.500
SORTS. BUT IT CAN ALSO BE

00:30:35.567 --> 00:30:37.802
LARGER GROUPS THAT LIKE THE

00:30:37.869 --> 00:30:38.903
ONES THAT I MENTIONED THAT

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:40.505
MIGHT RAISE FUNDS FOR A CERTAIN

00:30:40.572 --> 00:30:42.574
TYPE OF PARKER'S CERTAIN REGION

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.409
OF PARKS. BUT I MENTIONED

00:30:44.475 --> 00:30:45.443
THERE'S TWO OTHER THINGS THAT

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:47.879
APPLY TO YOUR- QUESTION I

00:30:47.946 --> 00:30:50.982
BELIEVE IN ONE OF THEM IS THAT.

00:30:51.049 --> 00:30:52.584
PARKS PARTNERS WITH

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:54.552
MUNICIPALITIES AND PUBLIC

00:30:54.619 --> 00:30:57.188
AGENCIES TO HELP MANAGE PARKS

00:30:57.255 --> 00:30:58.256
SO FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE STATE

00:30:58.323 --> 00:30:59.791
PARKS. THEY BELIEVE THERE'S

00:30:59.857 --> 00:31:01.826
ABOUT FIFTY STATE PARKS THAT

00:31:01.893 --> 00:31:03.127
ARE MANAGED BY REGIONAL PARK

00:31:03.194 --> 00:31:06.464
SYSTEMS AND LOCAL PARK SYSTEMS

00:31:06.531 --> 00:31:08.466
IN PARTNERSHIP WITH PARKS THEY-

00:31:08.533 --> 00:31:09.801
DELIVER THE SERVICES THAT STATE%

00:31:09.867 --> 00:31:12.470
PARKS DOES NAY. THEY OFTENTIMES

00:31:12.537 --> 00:31:15.073
HAVE. SIGNAGE THAT INDICATES

00:31:15.139 --> 00:31:16.107
THAT THIS IS A CALIFORNIA STATE

00:31:16.174 --> 00:31:18.276
PARK AND THEN WE HAVE ANOTHER

00:31:18.343 --> 00:31:22.280
TYPE OF PARTNER. WHICH IS A- WE

00:31:22.347 --> 00:31:23.514
HAVE NON PROFITS THAT ARE

00:31:23.581 --> 00:31:25.316
MANAGING PARKS IN PARTNERSHIP

00:31:25.383 --> 00:31:26.851
WITH PARKS AND WITH THOSE PARKS

00:31:26.918 --> 00:31:28.119
WE HAVE CO MANAGEMENT

00:31:28.186 --> 00:31:30.355
AGREEMENTS SO FAR THAT IS WHAT

00:31:30.421 --> 00:31:32.991
WAS NOT ALLOWED CO MANAGEMENT

00:31:33.057 --> 00:31:34.525
AGREEMENTS THERE WAS NO LEGAL

00:31:34.592 --> 00:31:36.794
FRAMEWORK FORTY FOUR RIGHT NOW

00:31:36.861 --> 00:31:38.496
WE HAVE NINE OF THOSE IN PLACE

00:31:38.563 --> 00:31:40.164
AND I THINK THAT LEGISLATION

00:31:40.231 --> 00:31:42.867
ALLOWED FOR TWENTY OF THEM. AND

00:31:42.934 --> 00:31:44.802
WE DON'T REALLY MAKES ALL OF

00:31:44.869 --> 00:31:47.005
THIS TECH AND WORK WELL IS WE

00:31:47.071 --> 00:31:48.973
HAVE A NEW PARTNERSHIPS OFFICE

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:50.308
AND SO IT'S EXCITING BECAUSE

00:31:50.375 --> 00:31:54.712
EACH OF THESE- EFFORTS ARE

00:31:54.779 --> 00:31:56.014
CREATING- BASICALLY THE

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:57.582
EXPERTISE WITHIN PARKS TO BE

00:31:57.649 --> 00:32:00.418
ABLE TO WORK. WITH ALL OF THE-

00:32:00.485 --> 00:32:01.819
COMPLEXITIES OF WORKING WITH

00:32:01.886 --> 00:32:02.820
THESE NEW PARTNERS AND I SEE

00:32:02.887 --> 00:32:05.356
THAT. AS REALLY AN EXCITING

00:32:05.423 --> 00:32:07.358
PATH FOR THE FUTURE THAT

00:32:07.425 --> 00:32:09.394
INCREASES SUPPORT FOR PARKS.

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:11.529
THAT DIVERSIFIES THE MANAGEMENT

00:32:11.596 --> 00:32:13.531
OF PARKS WHILE KEEPING TO THE

00:32:13.598 --> 00:32:15.933
SPIRIT AND TO THE MISSION OF

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:16.467
THE CALIFORNIA STATE PARK

00:32:16.534 --> 00:32:18.903
SYSTEM. THE REAL STRENGTH S.

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:20.371
AND THEN OFTEN WE HAVE ONE

00:32:20.438 --> 00:32:23.007
LAST. QUESTION AND YOU WERE IT

00:32:23.074 --> 00:32:24.275
WAS INTERESTING YOU RAISED IT

00:32:24.342 --> 00:32:26.044
IN YOUR YOUR PUBLIC COMMENTS

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:27.078
YOU TALKED ABOUT PARK

00:32:27.145 --> 00:32:29.480
ACQUISITIONS. AND I KNOW THERE

00:32:29.547 --> 00:32:32.650
WAS THIS STORY NEWS STORY THAT

00:32:32.717 --> 00:32:33.885
WAS A YEAR YEAR AND A HALF AGO

00:32:33.951 --> 00:32:35.286
THAT BASICALLY SAID- STATE

00:32:35.353 --> 00:32:36.788
PARKS HAS BEEN ACQUIRED THROUGH

00:32:36.854 --> 00:32:39.090
THINGS AND- IN RECENT YEARS AND

00:32:39.157 --> 00:32:41.659
YET. THE STATE BOND MEASURES

00:32:41.726 --> 00:32:43.895
THAT HAVE PASSED FOR PARKS. RUN

00:32:43.961 --> 00:32:46.230
MONEY THROUGH THE STATE FOR

00:32:46.297 --> 00:32:48.266
LOCAL URBAN PARKS BECAUSE

00:32:48.333 --> 00:32:49.400
THAT'S WHERE THERE WERE

00:32:49.467 --> 00:32:50.335
CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF

00:32:50.401 --> 00:32:53.471
UNDERSERVED PEOPLE. AND SO AND

00:32:53.538 --> 00:32:55.306
THE PARKS FORWARD THE REFORM

00:32:55.373 --> 00:32:56.941
PROCESS SAID THERE SHOULD BE A

00:32:57.008 --> 00:32:59.110
PARK EVERY SO OFTEN. AND THEY

00:32:59.177 --> 00:33:00.912
WERE RELEASE NOT DRAWING THE

00:33:00.978 --> 00:33:02.580
DISTINCTION BETWEEN STATE PARKS

00:33:02.647 --> 00:33:04.582
AND MONEY FOR URBAN PARKS WHERE

00:33:04.649 --> 00:33:07.051
THERE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES.

00:33:07.118 --> 00:33:10.288
A AND YET YOU ALSO SAID. GOOD

NEW PARKS SO. ARE ARE YOU

CAN BE ABOUT LANDS THAT ARE

00:33:54.065 --> 00:33:55.767
UNIMPORTANT CONNECTING PEACE

00:33:55.833 --> 00:33:57.702
WITHIN AN EXISTING STATE PARK

00:33:57.769 --> 00:33:59.404
OR IT CAN BE LANDS AND ACTUALLY

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:01.172

DISCOVERED OR REALIZED THAT

00:34:55.059 --> 00:34:57.094
SINCE HE YEAR TWO THOUSAND

00:34:57.161 --> 00:34:58.796
STATE PARKS HAS DIRECTED

00:34:58.863 --> 00:35:02.266
COMMUNITY GRANTS ACROSS

FOR A LOW INCOME COMMUNITY THAT

00:35:18.683 --> 00:35:20.885
DIDN'T HAVE A POOL. I MEAN IT'S

00:35:20.952 --> 00:35:23.754
REALLY IMPORTANT- IT'S A REALLY

00:35:23.821 --> 00:35:27.558
IMPORTANT DELIVERY OF RESOURCES

00:35:27.625 --> 00:35:29.527
TO COMMUNITIES ACROSS

00:35:29.594 --> 00:35:31.395
CALIFORNIA AND- ONE OF THE

00:35:31.462 --> 00:35:33.364
THINGS THAT I REALLY WANT TO DO

00:35:33.431 --> 00:35:34.899
AND AM ALREADY STARTING TO DO

00:35:34.966 --> 00:35:37.301
IS TO PROMOTE THE FACT THAT

00:35:37.368 --> 00:35:39.270
STATE PARKS IS ALSO DIRECTING

00:35:39.337 --> 00:35:41.339
FUNDS TO COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE

00:35:41.405 --> 00:35:42.807
STATE. BECAUSE I PERSONALLY

00:35:42.874 --> 00:35:45.810
FEEL THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

00:35:45.877 --> 00:35:48.212
THAT PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA FEEL

00:35:48.279 --> 00:35:50.114
OWNERSHIP ABOUT THE PARKS AND

00:35:50.181 --> 00:35:52.383
NOTHING LIKE OWNERSHIP AROUND

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:54.218
PARKS LIKE HAVING ONE IN YOUR

00:35:54.285 --> 00:35:56.954
TOWN. WELL THE NEXT TIME PAUL

INTO STATE PARKS IN RECENT

00:36:01.993 --> 00:36:04.428
YEARS YOU START THAT STATISTIC

00:36:04.495 --> 00:36:06.097

00:39:05.309 --> 00:39:08.145
REDUCTION IN THE FUNDING. FOR

00:39:08.212 --> 00:39:10.715

IN TERMS OF VOTER REGISTRATION

00:39:58.195 --> 00:40:01.232

00:40:01.298 --> 00:40:04.268
CHANGE IN RATES CHANGE FEES.

00:40:04.335 --> 00:40:08.439
CAN BE REALLY SHOCKING- BUT WE

00:40:08.506 --> 00:40:10.307
THIS REALLY IS MAKING US LOOK

00:40:10.374 --> 00:40:13.177
AT HOW ARE THOSE FEES ASSESSED

00:40:13.244 --> 00:40:15.713
AND HOW FOR EXAMPLE HOW CAN

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:17.281
FEES PERHAPS JUST KEEP UP WITH

00:40:17.348 --> 00:40:18.549
THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX OR

00:40:18.616 --> 00:40:21.118
SOMETHING LIKE THAT- BUT IT IT

00:40:21.185 --> 00:40:24.321
I. I RECOGNIZE THE SHOCK IT'S

00:40:24.388 --> 00:40:25.556
ACTUALLY SOMETHING I'VE SEEN

00:40:25.623 --> 00:40:27.691
HAPPEN ALSO IN THE WIDER WORLD

00:40:27.758 --> 00:40:32.062

THAT IT'S TEN DOLLARS A YEAR

00:40:47.778 --> 00:40:49.280

00:40:54.618 --> 00:40:56.754
REASONABLE. THANK YOU FOR

00:43:42.119 --> 00:43:44.388
SEEN COST EFFICIENCIES- OF.

00:43:44.455 --> 00:43:46.991
THOSE BASICALLY THEY OPERATE

00:43:47.057 --> 00:43:49.426
THE PARKS AS WE WOULD. R. COSTA

00:43:49.493 --> 00:43:52.329
FAR REDUCE WE STILL ARE THEY

00:43:52.396 --> 00:43:54.365
HAVE BEEN PURCHASED IN STATE

00:43:54.431 --> 00:43:57.368
PARK PURCHASED WITH STATE PARK

ENTITIES. TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:04.808
THEY'RE MANAGED- IN THE

00:44:04.875 --> 00:44:05.909
FRAMEWORK THAT STATE PARKS

00:44:05.976 --> 00:44:08.345
MANAGES PARKS SO THAT IS A

00:44:08.412 --> 00:44:10.080
SERIOUS CONSIDERATION IN TERMS

00:44:10.147 --> 00:44:12.182
OF FUNDING WE DO LOOK. AT FACT

00:44:12.249 --> 00:44:13.650

WILL BE LOOK AT- PROPERTIES ARE

00:44:15.886 --> 00:44:17.988
LANDS WHAT IS IT GOING TO COST.

00:44:18.055 --> 00:44:19.256
WHAT IS IT GOING TO COST TO

00:44:19.323 --> 00:44:21.725
MANAGE AND OR WILL WE BE ABLE

00:44:21.792 --> 00:44:23.527
TO DO IT AND IF WE CAN'T DO IT

00:44:23.594 --> 00:44:24.495
WHAT KINDS OF PARTNERSHIPS

00:44:24.561 --> 00:44:27.164
COULD MAKE THIS WORK IF IT'S A

00:44:27.231 --> 00:44:29.633

00:44:35.539 --> 00:44:36.874
EXAMINING OUR PAST IN THE

00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:39.176
HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. I KNOW

00:44:39.243 --> 00:44:41.145
THAT- PARKS ARE NO DIFFERENT

00:44:41.211 --> 00:44:43.147

WAY DISMISSING ANY OF OUR

00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:12.409
NATION'S PASTIME I JUST THINK

00:45:12.476 --> 00:45:14.378
THAT THERE IS- THERE IS A LOT

00:45:14.445 --> 00:45:16.880
OF HISTORICAL VALUE- GOOD OR

00:45:16.947 --> 00:45:19.817
BAD. THAT ARE DRESSED IN SOME

00:45:19.883 --> 00:45:22.019
OF THE NAMES OF OUR PARKS AND

00:45:22.086 --> 00:45:22.619
SERVICE JUST CURIOUS WHAT YOUR

00:45:22.686 --> 00:45:24.254
THOUGHTS WERE ON THAT. SENATOR

00:45:24.321 --> 00:45:25.656
I'M SO GLAD YOU ASKED THAT

00:45:25.722 --> 00:45:28.292
QUESTION BECAUSE I KNOW. I KNOW

00:45:28.358 --> 00:45:30.060
WHAT THIS STORY BRINGS UP JUST

00:45:30.127 --> 00:45:31.028
IN ANY COMMUNITY THAT'S

00:45:31.095 --> 00:45:32.796
CONSIDERING NAME CHANGES. YEAH

00:45:32.863 --> 00:45:34.364
AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT WHAT WE

00:45:34.431 --> 00:45:36.633
ARE PUTTING TOGETHER. IS A

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:39.603
ROBUST PUBLIC PROCESS- AND THAT

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:42.172
INCLUDES BRINGING IN A HIGH

00:45:42.239 --> 00:45:44.174
LEVEL ADVISORY COMMITTEE. OF

00:45:44.241 --> 00:45:47.211
EXPERTS FROM UNIVERSITIES AND

00:45:47.277 --> 00:45:47.744
FROM A DIVERSITY OF

00:45:47.811 --> 00:45:52.349
PERSPECTIVES. HISTORIANS AND

00:45:52.416 --> 00:45:54.084
THEY'RE GOING TO BE WORKING. TO

00:45:54.151 --> 00:45:55.686
REVIEW NAMES A PROBLEM BEFORE

00:45:55.752 --> 00:45:58.088
THE GROUP- AND THAT WILL

00:45:58.155 --> 00:46:01.158
INCLUDE MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS

00:46:01.225 --> 00:46:01.925
FINDING OUT WHAT THE WHOLE

00:46:01.992 --> 00:46:04.161
STORY BUT REALLY THE BASIS OF

00:46:04.228 --> 00:46:05.896
WHAT WE WANT TO DO. BECAUSE

00:46:05.963 --> 00:46:08.265
PARKS ARE ABOUT NATURAL HISTORY

00:46:08.332 --> 00:46:10.534
AND CULTURAL HISTORY AND WE

00:46:10.601 --> 00:46:12.236
WANT TO BE ABLE TO TELL THE

00:46:12.302 --> 00:46:14.171
FULL STORY OF HISTORY NOT JUST

00:46:14.238 --> 00:46:16.140
HAVE NAMES THAT ARE REALLY

00:46:16.206 --> 00:46:18.876
REMAINS OR- STORIES ARE NOT

00:46:18.942 --> 00:46:20.644
TOLD THAN WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS

00:46:20.711 --> 00:46:22.079
THAT THROUGHOUT PARKS AND I CAN

00:46:22.146 --> 00:46:24.882
SEE THIS FROM MY PHONE BACK.

00:46:24.948 --> 00:46:25.983
BACKGROUND WHAT. THERE ARE

00:46:26.049 --> 00:46:28.352
NUMEROUS UNTOLD STORIES AND

00:46:28.418 --> 00:46:30.120
PARKS SO HOW DO THEY FIT

00:46:30.187 --> 00:46:32.222
TOGETHER IN TERMS OF PEOPLE'S

00:46:32.289 --> 00:46:34.091
FAMILY HISTORY IN A PARKING THE

00:46:34.158 --> 00:46:35.459
PLACES A DAY GONE AND VISITED

00:46:35.526 --> 00:46:37.494
AND COME TO KNOW AND THAT'S ONE

00:46:37.561 --> 00:46:38.495
OF THE ATTACHMENTS THAT PEOPLE

00:46:38.562 --> 00:46:42.232
HAVE. TO NAMES- BUT WE WANT TO

00:46:42.299 --> 00:46:44.701
BE NOT ONLY VERY CAREFUL IN THE

00:46:44.768 --> 00:46:46.136
NAMES THAT WE CONSIDER BUT WE

00:46:46.203 --> 00:46:48.372
WANT TO BE ABSOLUTELY TO USE

00:46:48.438 --> 00:46:50.474
THE WORD YOU USED INCLUSIVE.

00:46:50.541 --> 00:46:51.742
AND HOW WE HAVE THESE

00:46:51.808 --> 00:46:53.944
DISCUSSIONS AND IF THERE'S ANY

00:46:54.011 --> 00:46:55.112
DECISION THAT WAS GOING TO BE

00:46:55.179 --> 00:46:56.613
MADE OR THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE

00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:58.749
NAY ABOUT A NAME OR A NAME

00:46:58.815 --> 00:47:01.185
CHANGE. THAT'S GOING TO GO TO

00:47:01.251 --> 00:47:03.086
THE CALIFORNIA PARKS COMMISSION

00:47:03.153 --> 00:47:04.555
AND THERE WILL BE A PUBLIC

00:47:04.621 --> 00:47:05.923
NOTICE AND IT WOULD BE A PUBLIC

00:47:05.989 --> 00:47:07.991
HEARING IN CONVERSATION. BEFORE

00:47:08.058 --> 00:47:09.927
THERE'S ANY STARTED CHANGE

00:47:09.993 --> 00:47:12.029
RELATIVE TO A NAME AND PARKS.

00:47:12.095 --> 00:47:13.197
BUT WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT I

00:47:13.263 --> 00:47:14.798
AM SEEING. THAT WHAT'S

00:47:14.865 --> 00:47:16.934
HAPPENING IN CARSON IF YOU

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.236
AREAS WHERE BIRDS HAVE. BEEN

00:47:19.303 --> 00:47:21.872
EFFORTS YOU- BEEN MADE. THE

00:47:21.939 --> 00:47:23.507
STORIES A FULLER STORY IT'S A

00:47:23.574 --> 00:47:25.275
DEEPER STORY IT'S A IT'S A

DISAPPEARS IT JUST BECOMES A

00:47:29.046 --> 00:47:31.014
BETTER STORE A BIGGER STORY.

00:47:31.081 --> 00:47:32.950
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M

00:47:33.016 --> 00:47:35.419
EXCITED ABOUT IS THAT I REALLY

00:47:35.485 --> 00:47:38.689
BELIEVE. THAT PARKS NEED TO BE

00:47:38.755 --> 00:47:40.490
PLACES WHERE PEOPLE CAN SEE

00:47:40.557 --> 00:47:43.327
THEMSELVES WHETHER THEY'RE THE

00:47:43.393 --> 00:47:44.027

THIS WEEK. OR FIRST GENERATION

00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:49.399

OUR EFFORT. IS REALLY ABOUT

00:47:54.738 --> 00:47:55.372
INCLUSIVITY. AND I WILL JUST

00:47:55.439 --> 00:47:56.640

TO FIGURE OUT WHO YOU WERE- AND

00:49:03.206 --> 00:49:07.177
