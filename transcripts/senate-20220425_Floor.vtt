SUPPORT OF S. R. EIGHTY ONE. NOW

00:18:50.629 --> 00:18:55.200
AS I STRUGGLE TO FIND MY GLASSES

00:18:55.267 --> 00:18:57.636
- NO ONE I THINK ALL OF US KNOW

00:18:57.703 --> 00:19:01.440
THIS NO ONE INVITES HARASSMENT

00:19:01.507 --> 00:19:06.144
ABUSE ASSAULT OR RAPE. EFFORT

00:19:06.211 --> 00:19:07.946
DOESN'T MATTER WHAT OUR WARDROBE

00:19:08.013 --> 00:19:10.048
DECISIONS ARE OR OTHER

00:19:10.115 --> 00:19:13.085
ACTIVITIES WE DO NOT INVITE THAT

00:19:13.151 --> 00:19:15.521
TYPE OF ASSAULT AND THIS IS THE

00:19:15.587 --> 00:19:19.091
POINT OF DENIM DAY. WE ALL KNOW

00:19:19.157 --> 00:19:21.360
HAVE THE HIGH NUMBER OF SEXUAL

00:19:21.426 --> 00:19:23.295
ASSAULTS BUT WE MAY NOT REALIZE

00:19:23.362 --> 00:19:25.097
THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT HIGH

00:19:25.163 --> 00:19:29.535
NUMBER. ONE STATE FOUND THAT 76%

00:19:29.601 --> 00:19:31.203
OF INCARCERATED WOMEN IN THAT

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:34.973
STATE WERE SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.775
ABUSE BY THE AGE OF THIRTEEN

00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:41.613
SEVENTY. 6% WE ALSO KNOW THAT

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.982
MANY MANY RAPES AND SEXUAL

00:19:44.049 --> 00:19:47.085
ASSAULTS GO UNREPORTED. THAT THE

00:19:47.152 --> 00:19:49.521
SHAME RELATED TO THIS OR THE

00:19:49.588 --> 00:19:52.124
FEELING THAT SOMEHOW HI THE

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:53.926
PERSON WHO WAS ASSAULTED THAT

00:19:53.992 --> 00:19:55.761
SOMEHOW WE CONTRIBUTED TO IT

00:19:55.827 --> 00:19:58.230
HAPPENING IT WAS OUR FAULT WE

00:19:58.297 --> 00:20:00.365
THEN DON'T REPORT. NO THIS

00:20:00.432 --> 00:20:02.134
PREJUDICE ALSO PROVIDED LAW

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.269
ENFORCEMENT FOR A LONG TIME AND

00:20:04.336 --> 00:20:07.406
WE FOUND THAT EVEN WHEN SEXUAL

00:20:07.472 --> 00:20:09.274
ASSAULTS AND RAPES WERE REPORTED

00:20:09.341 --> 00:20:11.410
THEY WERE NOT PRIORITIZED FOR

00:20:11.476 --> 00:20:14.313
ENFORCEMENT AND THE GREAT

00:20:14.379 --> 00:20:16.114
EXAMPLE OF WHAT THAT WAS. THOSE

00:20:16.181 --> 00:20:17.883
PEOPLE WHO WERE RAPED WHO WENT

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:19.585
IN TO THE HOSPITAL AND GOT THE

00:20:19.651 --> 00:20:21.753
WHOLE KIT WHICH THE WHOLE

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:22.688
EVIDENCE WHICH IS CALLED A RAPE

00:20:22.754 --> 00:20:24.990
KIT. THOSE RAPE KITS WERE LEFT

00:20:25.057 --> 00:20:28.126
ON SHELVES EVIDENCE SHOWS FOR

00:20:28.193 --> 00:20:29.661
YEARS UNTESTED. WE'VE CHANGE

00:20:29.728 --> 00:20:31.630
THAT NOW THE LEGISLATURE IS

00:20:31.697 --> 00:20:33.865
TAKEN OUT ON WE'RE FINDING OUR

00:20:33.932 --> 00:20:34.866
POLICE DEPARTMENTS WE ARE MADE

00:20:34.933 --> 00:20:36.868
IT A PRIORITY. AND WE ARE SEEING

00:20:36.935 --> 00:20:41.707
AN INCREASE NOT ONLY IN. THE THE

00:20:41.773 --> 00:20:43.976
ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS BUT ALSO IN

00:20:44.042 --> 00:20:45.677
THE CONVICTIONS THE CATCHING

00:20:45.744 --> 00:20:48.046
EVERY PERSON THE CONVICTIONS.

00:20:48.113 --> 00:20:49.414
AND WE HAVE TO ELIMINATE THESE

00:20:49.481 --> 00:20:51.149
TYPES OF PREJUDICES IN THESE

00:20:51.216 --> 00:20:53.285
ATTITUDES IN ORDER FOR ANYONE

00:20:53.352 --> 00:20:55.320
AND EVERYONE WHO EXPERIENCES A

00:20:55.387 --> 00:20:57.322
SEXUAL ASSAULT TO FEEL NO SHAME

00:20:57.389 --> 00:20:59.091
ABOUT REPORTING IT AND REALLY

00:20:59.157 --> 00:21:01.627
THAT IS THE POINT OF DENIM DAY.

00:21:01.693 --> 00:21:04.630
SO I VERY MUCH STAND IN SUPPORT

00:21:04.696 --> 00:21:07.032

00:21:12.404 --> 00:21:13.839
MR PRESIDENT LADIES AND

00:21:13.905 --> 00:21:15.807
GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE TODAY I

00:21:15.874 --> 00:21:17.743
RISE ON BEHALF OF THE JEWISH

00:21:17.809 --> 00:21:19.678
CAUCUS IN STRONG SUPPORT FOR S.

00:21:19.745 --> 00:21:21.980
R. EIGHTY ONE. WHICH RECOGNIZES

00:21:22.047 --> 00:21:25.083
APRIL TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY TWENTY

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:26.652
TWO AS DOWN ON DAY IN CALIFORNIA

00:21:26.718 --> 00:21:28.353
. TODAY WE WERE DONE- TO SHOW

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:29.621
THAT WE STAND WITH SEXUAL

00:21:29.688 --> 00:21:31.923
ASSAULT SURVIVORS IN THE WOMEN

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:34.226
GIRLS AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHO

00:21:34.292 --> 00:21:36.461
HAVE BEEN ASSAULTED ABUSED OR

00:21:36.528 --> 00:21:39.197
HARASSED. JUDAISM TEACHES THAT

00:21:39.264 --> 00:21:41.133
ALL PEOPLE ARE SACRED BEINGS TO

00:21:41.199 --> 00:21:43.035
BE PROTECTED AND NURTURED AND

00:21:43.101 --> 00:21:45.771
THAT TO ACT AGAINST HIM AND

00:21:45.837 --> 00:21:46.905
VIOLENCE. IS TO ACT AGAINST THE

00:21:46.972 --> 00:21:49.474
DIVINE AND THE JEWISH TRADITION

00:21:49.541 --> 00:21:51.276
TO COST ANOTHER PAIN OR MORAL

00:21:51.343 --> 00:21:54.646
DEGRADATION IS A CAN TO MURDER.

00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:55.881
WHEN WE REFUSED TO CONFRONT

00:21:55.947 --> 00:21:57.249
THESE BEHAVIORS WE ARE

00:21:57.315 --> 00:22:00.419
COMPLICIT. ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE

00:22:00.485 --> 00:22:03.155
A BYSTANDER. AS STATED EARLIER

00:22:03.221 --> 00:22:05.290
THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS

00:22:05.357 --> 00:22:08.460
WAS PROUD TO SUPPORT A. B. NINE

00:22:08.527 --> 00:22:09.428
THIRTY NINE WHICH PROHIBITS THE

00:22:09.494 --> 00:22:11.563
SURVIVORS A TIRE TO BE USED AS

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:14.099
EVIDENCE OF CONSENT IN SEXUAL

00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:16.835
ASSAULT CASES. THE CHANGE WAS

00:22:16.902 --> 00:22:19.104
LONG OVERDUE AGAIN THERE IS

00:22:19.171 --> 00:22:22.140
NEVER AN EXCUSE TO BE HARASSED

00:22:22.207 --> 00:22:28.013
ABUSED ASSAULTED. OR RATE.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.648
CHANGING THE SOCIAL NORMS THAT

00:22:29.715 --> 00:22:31.917
ALLOW THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR IS

00:22:31.983 --> 00:22:34.052
IMPORTANT FOR CIVIL SOCIETY AND

00:22:34.119 --> 00:22:36.021
MAKING THIS CHANGE REQUIRES US

00:22:36.088 --> 00:22:37.856
TO CONTINUE TO WORK TO EDUCATE

00:22:37.923 --> 00:22:40.158
EVERYONE FROM CHILDREN FRIENDS

00:22:40.225 --> 00:22:42.561
FAMILIES THIS WEDNESDAY WE

00:22:42.627 --> 00:22:46.298
INVITE EVERYONE TO WEAR DENIM.

00:22:46.364 --> 00:22:48.366
IT IS A REALLY GOOD DAY TO SHOW

00:22:48.433 --> 00:22:50.402
THAT WE MUST SEND A STRONG

00:22:50.469 --> 00:22:51.970
MESSAGE THAT WE STAND WITH

00:22:52.037 --> 00:22:54.372
SURVIVORS AND VICTIMS FOR THIS

00:22:54.439 --> 00:22:56.074
REASON I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR

00:22:56.141 --> 00:22:58.176

00:23:08.653 --> 00:23:11.523
DAY. ONE OF THE STATED PURPOSES

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:14.025
OF DENIM DAY IS TO EDUCATE

00:23:14.092 --> 00:23:16.094
OTHERS ABOUT SEXUAL VIOLENCE. A

00:23:16.161 --> 00:23:18.096
LITTLE HISTORY THAT SOMETIMES

00:23:18.163 --> 00:23:18.630
GETS OVERLOOKED IN THESE

00:23:18.697 --> 00:23:20.966
DISCUSSIONS IS THAT DURING THE

00:23:21.032 --> 00:23:22.868
EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS MOST STATES

00:23:22.934 --> 00:23:25.837
EXCLUDED BLACK WOMEN BOTH FREE

00:23:25.904 --> 00:23:29.541
AND ENSLAVED FROM WORK RATE LAWS

00:23:29.608 --> 00:23:31.409
. IT WAS NOT UNTIL EIGHTEEN

00:23:31.476 --> 00:23:32.444
SIXTY ONE THAT A BLACK WOMAN

00:23:32.511 --> 00:23:34.646
COULD EVEN FILE RAPE CHARGES

00:23:34.713 --> 00:23:36.748
AGAINST A WHITE MAN. BLACK WOMEN

00:23:36.815 --> 00:23:38.250
ARE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE TO

00:23:38.316 --> 00:23:40.685
SEXUAL VIOLENCE DUE TO MULTIPLE

00:23:40.752 --> 00:23:43.288
SOURCES OF OPPRESSION. MORE THAN

00:23:43.355 --> 00:23:46.424
20% OF BLACK WOMEN ARE RAPED

00:23:46.491 --> 00:23:48.293
DURING OUR LIFETIMES. A LOT A

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.629
HIGHER SHARE THAN AMONG WOMEN

00:23:50.695 --> 00:23:53.331
OVERALL. IN THE UNITED STATES

00:23:53.398 --> 00:23:55.567
38% OF BLACK WOMEN EXPERIENCED

00:23:55.634 --> 00:23:58.804
SEXUAL VIOLENCE OTHER THAN RAPE

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:00.906
. ONE IN FOUR BLACK GIRLS WILL

00:24:00.972 --> 00:24:02.974
BE SEXUALLY ABUSED BEFORE THE

00:24:03.041 --> 00:24:05.944
AGE OF EIGHTEEN. AMONG STUDENTS

00:24:06.011 --> 00:24:08.113
11% OF BLACK GIRLS IN A NATIONAL

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:10.081
HIGH SCHOOL SAMPLE REPORTED

00:24:10.148 --> 00:24:14.052
HAVING BEEN RATE. 40% OF CONFIRM

00:24:14.119 --> 00:24:15.987
SEX TRAFFICKING SURVIVORS IN THE

00:24:16.054 --> 00:24:19.758
UNITED STATES ARE BLACK. ALL OF

00:24:19.825 --> 00:24:22.260
THESE STATISTICS ARE EVEN HIGHER

00:24:22.327 --> 00:24:24.863
FOR BLACK TRANS WOMEN AND FOR

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:27.265
OUR BLACK BOYS THEY ARE ALSO

00:24:27.332 --> 00:24:30.302
RAPED AND SEXUALLY ASSAULTED AT

00:24:30.368 --> 00:24:33.338
ALARMING RATES. BLACK BOYS FIRST

00:24:33.405 --> 00:24:36.174
SEXUAL ENCOUNTER ON AVERAGE IS

00:24:36.241 --> 00:24:39.878
AT AGE NINE OR TEN FROM AN OLDER

00:24:39.945 --> 00:24:42.280
WOMAN. AND ONE IN SIX BLACK BOYS

00:24:42.347 --> 00:24:45.617
HAVE SUFFERED SEXUAL ABUSE.

00:24:45.684 --> 00:24:48.887
THESE ACTS ARE OFTEN MINIMIZED

00:24:48.954 --> 00:24:51.289
AND IN FACT SEEN AS RITE OF

00:24:51.356 --> 00:24:55.026
PASSAGE. BUT OUR BLACK BOYS ARE

00:24:55.093 --> 00:24:57.629
VICTIMS JUST LIKE OUR BLACK

00:24:57.696 --> 00:25:00.799
GIRLS. BECAUSE OF AFRICAN

00:25:00.866 --> 00:25:02.567
AMERICANS UNIQUE HISTORY OF

00:25:02.634 --> 00:25:05.937
RACIST AND SEXIST VICTIMIZATION

00:25:06.004 --> 00:25:07.739
THE BLACK COMMUNITY HAS AN EVEN

00:25:07.806 --> 00:25:10.041
HARDER TIME THAN OTHERS DEALING

00:36:42.967 --> 00:36:44.669
THAT TRAGICALLY IS ALL TOO OFTEN

00:36:44.735 --> 00:36:46.938
EITHER IGNORED OR INTENTIONALLY

00:36:47.004 --> 00:36:49.507

OTTOMANS. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE

00:37:06.991 --> 00:37:08.759
RECOGNIZE THE GENOCIDE DO NOT

00:37:08.826 --> 00:37:11.262
JUST LIVING IN THE PAST THIS IS

00:37:11.329 --> 00:37:14.932

00:37:30.181 --> 00:37:32.149
FOR THE AGGRESSION TO CONTINUE

00:37:32.216 --> 00:37:34.418
ENABLING THOSE WHO MAY WANT TO

00:37:34.485 --> 00:37:36.954
DO THE SAME. AND THEY LOOKED TO

00:37:37.021 --> 00:37:39.323

REASON FOR WHY HIS PLAN IN

00:38:04.448 --> 00:38:05.383
EUROPE WOULD SUCCEED. WHEN WE

00:38:05.449 --> 00:38:11.555
DID. WHEN WE ENABLE THE DENIAL

00:38:11.622 --> 00:38:13.791
OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE WE

MAN. FROM THE POLITICAL DYNASTY

FROM NAPA COUNTY. IT'S NOT

00:52:06.723 --> 00:52:08.425
INCONSISTENT THAT JOHN MIGHT

PREDECESSORS IN THIS FAMILY AND

00:52:12.496 --> 00:52:15.732
BECAME A DEMOCRAT. JOHN HAD THAT

INDEPENDENT STREAK. WHEN WE RUN

SEVENTY NINE. I ADMIRED SO MUCH

00:52:25.375 --> 00:52:27.577
THAT HE HAD BEEN A LITTLE BIT

00:52:27.644 --> 00:52:30.313
OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE AREA TO BE

00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:31.147

RELATIONS ACT. THAT DISTRICT WAS

00:52:35.719 --> 00:52:38.021
VERY HEAVILY AGRICULTURAL THAT

00:52:38.088 --> 00:52:40.190
WAS NOT A POPULAR STAND TO TAKE

00:52:40.257 --> 00:52:42.392
IN THAT COUNTY. THAT DID NOT

00:52:42.459 --> 00:52:46.563
DETER JOHN DUNLAP ONE WHAT. HE

00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:48.498
CARRIED THAT. LEGISLATION

00:52:48.565 --> 00:52:52.402
PROUDLY. AND THAT LEGISLATION

00:52:52.469 --> 00:52:54.671
LIVES ON YET TODAY. THE

00:52:54.738 --> 00:52:56.039

00:52:56.106 --> 00:52:59.009
BOARD GOVERNS THAT ACT. THE DAY

00:52:59.075 --> 00:53:03.146
AUTHORED. HE ALSO CARRIED MANY

00:53:03.213 --> 00:53:04.981
ENVIRONMENTAL BILLS AS MY

00:53:05.048 --> 00:53:07.017
COLLEAGUE FROM NAPA OF THE

00:53:07.083 --> 00:53:11.621
KNOWLEDGE MAJOR BILLS. THAT WAS

00:53:11.688 --> 00:53:13.890
NOT ALSO ONE OF THE MORE POPULAR

00:53:13.957 --> 00:53:18.828
THEMES. IN THOSE DAYS. NOR WAS

00:53:18.895 --> 00:53:22.098
HIS POSITION ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE

00:53:22.165 --> 00:53:25.268
. BUT JOHN IS A MAN OF TRUE

00:53:25.335 --> 00:53:28.572
CONVICTION. AN IDEA WITH THE

00:53:28.638 --> 00:53:31.241
RECIPIENT EARLY ON OF MY CAREER

00:53:31.308 --> 00:53:33.543
OF HIS WIT. ELECTION NIGHT HE

00:53:33.610 --> 00:53:37.514
CALLED ME. AND I WAS VERY

00:53:37.581 --> 00:53:41.151
GRACIOUS. AND I RESPONDED CENTER

00:53:41.217 --> 00:53:43.353
DUNLAP I WOULD CERTAINLY LIKE TO

00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:45.221

ALL OF YOUR YEARS. ANY CAME BACK

00:53:48.525 --> 00:53:50.360
QUICKLY SAID WELL JIM YOU AND

00:53:50.427 --> 00:53:52.228
PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT I SAID

00:53:52.295 --> 00:53:54.164
ANYWAY. WELL THAT ISN'T

00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:56.099
NECESSARILY SELL BECAUSE

00:53:56.166 --> 00:53:58.501
SKIPPING FORWARD MANY YEARS I

00:53:58.568 --> 00:54:00.303
WAS DEEPLY HONORED TO RECEIVE A

00:54:00.370 --> 00:54:03.206
CALL FROM SENATOR DUNLAP.

00:54:03.273 --> 00:54:04.841
INVITING ME TO COME AND SPEAK AT

00:54:04.908 --> 00:54:06.776
HIS POLITICAL SCIENCE CLASS AT

00:54:06.843 --> 00:54:10.880
NAPA COLLEGE. AND I COULDN'T

00:54:10.947 --> 00:54:13.683
HEAP ENOUGH PRAISE ON THE MAN.

00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:16.052
WE MAY HAVE DIFFERED POLITICALLY

00:54:16.119 --> 00:54:18.221
. BUT I NEVER QUESTIONED HIS

00:54:18.288 --> 00:54:21.424
INTEGRITY NEVER QUESTION HIS

00:54:21.491 --> 00:54:24.327
COMMITMENT FEALTY TO HIS BELIEFS

00:54:24.394 --> 00:54:26.696
THOSE CORE BELIEFS THE COSTUME

00:54:26.763 --> 00:54:29.599
SOMETIMES TO BE OUT OF PART WITH

00:54:29.666 --> 00:54:32.235
OTHER PEOPLE IN HIS OWN FAMILY

00:54:32.302 --> 00:54:33.370
AND- SOMETIMES IN THE

00:54:33.436 --> 00:54:36.640
LEGISLATURE. BUT THAT WAS DONE

00:54:36.706 --> 00:54:38.675
THE WAY. HE LIVED A VERY

00:54:38.742 --> 00:54:41.177
PRODUCTIVE LIFE ALMOST IN ONE

00:54:41.244 --> 00:54:44.581
HUNDRED YEARS OLD. AND WE MADE

00:54:44.648 --> 00:54:46.549
IT A POINT TO STAY IN TOUCH FROM

00:54:46.616 --> 00:54:49.452
TIME TO TIME. AND I WOULD CALL

00:54:49.519 --> 00:54:50.720
THIS DAUGHTER AND ASK IF WOULD

00:54:50.787 --> 00:54:52.889
BE OKAY FOR ME TO CALL JOHN AND-

00:54:52.956 --> 00:54:55.091
CHAT WITH HIM. AND HE WAS ALWAYS

00:54:55.158 --> 00:54:56.292
VERY GRACIOUS WOULD TAKE THE

00:54:56.359 --> 00:55:00.797
CALL. THAT TAUGHT ME A LOT.

00:55:00.864 --> 00:55:03.199
ABOUT WHAT THE SENATE WAS ABOUT

00:55:03.266 --> 00:55:04.567
. NICER MOST OF HIS YEARS IN THE

00:55:04.634 --> 00:55:06.836

00:55:06.903 --> 00:55:08.405
FULL TERM IN THE SENATE HE KNEW

00:55:08.471 --> 00:55:10.407
WHAT THE SENATE WAS ALL ABOUT.

00:55:10.473 --> 00:55:12.876
IT WAS ABOUT BIPARTISANSHIP. THE

00:55:12.942 --> 00:55:15.045
COURTESY AND RESPECT. HE

00:55:15.111 --> 00:55:17.781
CERTAINLY CARRIED HIMSELF IN

00:55:17.847 --> 00:55:20.417
THAT MANNER IN THIS INSTITUTION

00:55:20.483 --> 00:55:22.218
. WE SHOULD BE VERY PROUD TO

00:55:22.285 --> 00:55:24.187

00:55:59.723 --> 00:56:01.691
LONGEVITY AND POLITICAL

00:56:01.758 --> 00:56:03.860

REPRESENTED VALLEJO AND SOLANO

00:56:11.301 --> 00:56:14.137
COUNTY AND HI I WAS IN HIGH

00:56:14.204 --> 00:56:16.206
SCHOOL IN VALLEJO. WHEN JOHN

DUNLAP WAS OUR ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:56:19.409 --> 00:56:21.478
AND A LOT OF US WERE. THAT'S

00:56:21.544 --> 00:56:22.746
SCHOOL STUDENTS ABOUT TO GO

00:56:22.812 --> 00:56:23.480
UNDER COLLEGE CONCERNED ABOUT A

00:56:23.546 --> 00:56:25.515
PARTICULAR FOREIGN INVOLVEMENT

00:56:25.582 --> 00:56:26.416
THE UNITED STATES HAD AT THE

00:56:26.483 --> 00:56:29.519
TIME. AND HE CAME AND MET WITH

00:56:29.586 --> 00:56:31.187
US AND HE CAME AND TALKED TO

00:56:31.254 --> 00:56:34.290
ASSIDUOUS CEREBRAL HE WAS HONEST

00:56:34.357 --> 00:56:36.526
AS WAS SAID HE WAS HUMOROUS. AND

00:56:36.593 --> 00:56:39.262
I THINK HE WAS GOING TO TALK TO

00:56:39.329 --> 00:56:40.563
ANYBODY AND TRY TO WORK THEM

00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:43.833
THROUGH THE ISSUE. N. AS WAS

00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:45.502

THE COASTAL COMMISSION. THAT ACT

00:56:47.804 --> 00:56:50.173
IS CELEBRATING FIFTY TWO YEARS

00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:51.875
AND I KNOW WHEN THERE WAS A

00:56:51.941 --> 00:56:53.276
FIFTY YEAR ANNIVERSARY HE WAS

00:56:53.343 --> 00:56:55.478
ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE THAT WAS

00:56:55.545 --> 00:56:57.413
AN AUTHOR OF THAT TO STILL BE

00:56:57.480 --> 00:56:59.849
AROUND AND I'M GLAD THAT HE HAD

00:56:59.916 --> 00:57:02.218
THE CHANCE. WHILE HE WAS ALIVE

00:57:02.285 --> 00:57:04.554
TO BE APPRECIATED FOR. AND

00:57:04.621 --> 00:57:07.557
HERE'S SOMETHING THAT WE I THINK

00:57:07.624 --> 00:57:10.860
SOMETIMES LOSE IN POLITICS.

00:57:10.927 --> 00:57:13.029
