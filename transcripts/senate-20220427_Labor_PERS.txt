STARTED WITH THE WITH THE- SO IT'S A WAY OF EXPRESSING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR COMMUNITY AND I THINK THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT MENTAL HEALTH. OF A OF A DRESS IN ALL OUR ISSUES. SO COMMUNITIES OF COLOR OF ACCESS TO CULTURE AND ARTS IS THROUGH THESE SMALL THEATERS- I'VE FOUND THAT THEY ALSO PROVIDE AN ENTRY LEVEL. EXPOSURE TO OUR YOUTH SO THEY COULD SEE THEMSELVES. GOING INTO THESE FIELDS ALL ON A PROFESSIONAL LEVEL NOT ONLY ANA ENTERTAINMENT LEVEL- YOU KNOW SO THE ARTS THESE SMALL THEATRES REALLY ARE IMPORTANT TO LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES WHO DON'T SEE THEMSELVES GOING TO THOSE BIG.

ASSEMBLE FORTINO NINE WAS TABLETS A LEGISLATIVE PROCESS TO ABOLISH THE AGRICULTURAL ABLE RE LABOR RELATIONS ACT ENCOURAGE AND PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYEES AND APPROPRIATE FUNDS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF FARMWORKER HOUSING. BY JULY FIRST TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE L. R. B. TO SUBMIT TO THE LEGISLATURE REPORT DETAILING THE PROCESS FOR ITS ABOLISHMENT. THAT INCLUDES RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SUBSEQUENT LANGUAGE LEGISLATIVE LANGUAGE TO ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVES OF THE BILL. KERN STATUE PROVIDES THE ARB WAS SPECIFIC POWERS AND RESPONSIBILITIES WITH REGARD TO AGRICULTURAL LABOR DISPUTES AND REPRESENTATION ELECTIONS. HOWEVER ACCORDING TO RECENT CALMATTERS ARTICLE THEY ARE BE OVERSEAS ANNUALLY JUST ONE OR TWO UNION ELECTIONS. WHILE OTHER AGRICULTURAL FACILITIES ARE DECERTIFYING THE UNITED FARM WORKERS UNION- INTO A TWENTY TWENTY NATIONAL EMPLOYMENT SURVEY FROM UNITED STATES PER OF LABOR STATISTICS. THE PERCENTAGE OF CALIFORNIA FARM WORKERS WHO BELONG TO A UNION IS ASSIST STATISTICALLY ZERO. WHICH MEANS THERE ARE SO FEW ACTIVE MEMBERS THEY FALL WITHIN THE MARGIN OF ERROR. US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR INDICATES THAT THE U. F. W. HAS ONLY SIXTY SIX HUNDRED ACTIVE AND RETIRED MEMBERS ACROSS MULTIPLE STATES. INTERACTIVITY IN THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR HAS DECLINED IN PART BECAUSE OF THE JUNE TWENTY TWENTY ONE DECISION BY THE US SUPREME COURT CALLED CEDAR NURSERY VERSES HAS SAID. THE DECISION OVERTURNED A CALIFORNIA LAW ALLOWING UNION ORGANIZER IS TO MEET WITH FARMWORKERS AT THEIR PLACE OF WORK DECLARING THAT IT UNCONSTITUTIONALLY APPROPRIATES PRIVATE LAND. SB FOURTEEN OH NINE WOULD CREATE A PROCESS TO ABOLISH THE BOARD AND ASK THE LEGISLATURE TO DIRECT WHAT IS CURRENTLY SPEND ON THE LRB. ON ADDITIONAL FARMWORKER HOUSING WHICH WOULD ACTUALLY BENEFIT THE WORKERS WHO HELP PUT FOOD ON ALL OF OUR TABLES. SB FOURTEEN OR NINE WOULD NOT PREVENT UNION ACTIVITY AT OUR AGRICULTURAL FACILITIES. IT WOULD SIMPLY TREAT ACT THE WORKERS LIKE EVERY OTHER WORKER IN THE STATE AND ENSURE THEY RECEIVE THE SAME ORGANIZING PROTECTIONS AS OTHER INDUSTRIES. TRUE THE LRB IS A GOVERNMENT AGENCY IN SEARCH OF A MISSION AND ITS RESPONSIBILITIES ARE DUPLICATIVE OF OTHER STATE AGENCIES. I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THIS MORNING. I HAVE TWO WITNESSES CALLING INTO THE COMMITTEE TODAY IN SUPPORT JEFF RASMUSSEN WHO IS A FARMER WHO HAS INTERACTED WITH A R. B. AND SYLVIA LOPEZ IS A WORK. DAVIS WHO REPRESENTED THE WORKERS AT THE GROWING FARMS IN THEIR EFFORT TO DECERTIFY REPRESENTATION BY THE U. F. W. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR YOU'RE ON THE LINE. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE THANK YOU WONDERFUL CHAIR IN MEMBERS FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK ON AS THE FOURTEEN OH NINE. MY NAME IS JEFF RASMUSSEN I'M NOT HERE TO RIP REPRESENT ANY SPECIFIC CURRENT COMPANY OR ORGANIZATION. BE HONEST I WAS A BIT SHOCKED AND HUMBLED WHEN CENTER STAFF. INTEGRO STAFF ASKED ME TO SPEAK AT THIS HEARING TODAY. MY UNDERSTANDING SENATOR BOTH COULD NOT BE HERE BECAUSE OF A FAMILY EMERGENCY NOPE YOU KEEP HER AND HER FAMILY MEMBER YOUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS HAVING SAID THAT I'M NOT SURE MY COMMENTS WITH THE SENATOR. AGAIN BEING ON THE COMMITTEE. I WAS SHOCKED LIKE MANY AFTER READING THIS BILL. I CAN ONLY WONDER WHAT IS A SENATOR THINKING HERE TRAINEE. ANY THOUGHTS OF GOOD IN BOTH GOOD AND BAD AND RUSHED TO MY HEAD. BEFORE MEETING THE JUDGES ON THE BILL AND SEND TO GATHER MORE BASED KNOWLEDGE ON IT ACCENT THE AGRICULTURE LABOR RELATIONS ACT AND THE HISTORY. OF THE LABOR BOARD CREATED SOME FORTY SEVEN YEARS AGO. I REFLECTED ON MY LIFE'S JOURNEY WHEN I FIRST STARTED WORKING RATE THOSE AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN. IN THE MID NINETEEN EIGHTIES. MANY OF MY LIFE MENTORS ARE OR WERE.

THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY- WILL MOVE ON TO THE SECOND LEAD SUPPORT WHEN THE SOVIET LOPEZ IF YOU THERE YOU MAY PROCEED. SO BILL LOPEZ CAN YOU HEAR ME. OKAY SO ARE ARE- OUR STAFF IS TELLING US THAT SYLVIA LOPEZ IS NOT CURRENTLY IN THE QUEUE IS BEING COMMITTEE NOT ON THE COLE I MOMENT CAN I LOOK AT HER. THANK YOU. ALL OF YOUR YOUR LINE IS OPEN. YEAH- MY NAME IS ROBIN LOPEZ- I'M FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY. I'M ONE OF THE I'M A FARM WORKERS FROM CALIFORNIA A COUPLE YEARS ABOUT A YEAR I GOT HERE SINCE I WAS FOUR YEARS OLD. ALL MY FAMILY WOULD WORK IN THE FIELD AND I'M CURRENTLY BAKER. I THINK THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION TO SHARE. IT COULD BRING IT UP IN THE MOMENT. THAT WORKING ABOUT THE L. A. B. THAT USED TO THE NIGHTMARE THAT WE HAVE GROWN FARMING COMPANY- A COUPLE YEARS AGO- WHEN ELLERBEE A PARTY LINE VOTE BY LEARN A WORD AWARE OUR RIGHTS- YEAH. WHEN THEY WERE WITH A U. S. ASSEMBLY BUT MY I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT I'M JUST THIS ONE WERE SHE NOTES UNDER TABLE THE AYLER B. AND THERE U. S. W. SEVEN I COULD AND I. DON'T CAN- DON'T HAVE NO NO WAY TO PROVE THAT I STARTED MY EYES- BUT THE L. A. B. IS JUST TO HELP THE U. S. W. AND NOT THE WORKERS. AND MY OWN EXPERIENCE AND I WERE MICHAEL WORKERS ALL THE FROM WHICH THAT I KNOW MORTGAGE THOUSAND FARMWORKERS. I BELIEVE I KNOW MORE FARMWORKERS THEN THE A LARGE B- AND- A LONG TIME AGO WE WERE PLANNING AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS WITH MY COWORKERS AND GRANDMA FARMI TO SHUT DOWN THE L. R. P. I THINK. I THINK THAT THAT'S OF MY- MAYBE CAN SO AT MAY. THAT MONEY THEY- USE IT GOOD HOW US IN THE NEXT WAY. BUT NOT NOT LEAVING ALL THAT MY WITH A ALIVE. AND ALSO. THE U. S. W. AND THE L. R. V. WHEN WE WENT THROUGH THIS BAD EXPERIENCE WITH THEM. THEY WERE ENOUGH TO SEND US BACK TO MEXICO. SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN THAT MEANS THAT THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE FARMWORKERS. AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE WORLD WAR ONE AND LIKE MANY YEARS AGO TO SHUT DOWN THE L. A. B. AND HOPEFULLY- THAT WOULD HAPPEN. AND THAT'S MY EXPERIENCE THAT I SHARE WITH YOU GUYS- I'M TALKING THIS I'M SAYING THIS BECAUSE I LEFT IT WITH WITH WITH MY COWORKER- THERE MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND WITNESS OF THIS. BETTER CHOICE AND I'M JUST GOING ON HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND I THINK THIS NEEDS TO STOP.

THERE'S NO POINT TO HAVE THE OFFICE OF THE ELLERBEE WENT SILENT SHOPPER HE'D TO US.

IS ACCEPTING ALL THE AMENDMENTS I DO APPRECIATE THAT THAT YEAR AND THE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS- YOU KNOW FOLKS YOU YOU ALL KNOW COURSE HOW MUCH THE COVER NINETEEN- PANDEMIC CREATED- SO MUCH UPHEAVAL AND PROBLEMS FOR OUR- FOR CALIFORNIANS FOR FOLKS ALL OVER THE WORLD. UNEMPLOYMENT COURSE TYPICALLY RISES STEADILY OVER THE COURSE OF RECESSION. BUT THE PANDEMIC IMMEDIATELY SHOCKED ECONOMY WITH THIS. MASSIVE SPIKE IN UNEMPLOYMENT THAT SKYROCKET TO A RECORD BREAKING 16% OVER THE COURSE OF ONE MONTH. EVERYONE REMEMBERS THAT SO MANY WHO STRUGGLE TO AFFORD NECESSITIES TURN TO THE UNEMPLOYMENT DISABILITY INSURANCE SYSTEMS FOR CRITICAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT. BUT THIS- THIS WHOLE APPROACH HIGHLIGHTED A LOT OF THE INEQUITIES IN THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET. FOR A SELF EMPLOYED WORKERS. WHO ORDINARILY ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO COLLECT UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS ACT A COURSE WHICH CREATED THE PANDEMIC ON EMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM- THAT A LOT OF OUR STOPS WERE HELPING PEOPLE. NAVIGATE DURING THE PANDEMIC GOT OF COURSE PROVIDED SELF EMPLOYED WORKERS WITH ACCESS TO UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS FOR THE FIRST TIME. AND IN THE FIRST JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE SCALE OF THE USE OF THIS IN THE FIRST FOUR MONTHS THE PANDEMIC FROM MARCH TO JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY- SOMETHING LIKE FOUR MILLION. CALIFORNIANS THAT'S 10% OF OUR TOTAL POPULATION. HI THE FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS VALUE I CLAIMS WITH THE STATE'S UNEMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT EDT ANOTHER SWAN MILLION SELF EMPLOYED CALIFORNIANS. ARE FILED P. U. A. CLAIMS. SO EDT ISSUED ABOUT A HUNDRED EIGHTY BILLION DOLLARS IN BENEFITS IN THE SINCE THE PANDEMIC BEGAN. SO NOW THESE HISTORIC INVESTMENTS IN PANDEMIC YOU'RE A PROGRAMS HAS ENDED.

THE ABILITY TO COLLECT BENEFITS ONCE IT WHEN FACING WORK SCARCITY. AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS THERE ARE SO MANY VITAL QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE ANSWERED FOR A PROGRAM LIKE THIS TO BE EFFECTIVE- THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS WILL RESHAPE THE BILL.

AND THIS CRISIS SHOWED UP OF A GAP IN OUR SYSTEM. WOULD HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A GOOD WAY TO. ADDRESS IN. THE FUTURE THEN- MISTER CHART WITH THE AMENDMENTS I WOULD MOVE TO DO. THANK YOU SENATOR LET ME JUST SOME. LET ME JUST READ. ESSENTIALLY THE LAST PARAGRAPH OF. THE BILL IT THIS IS STANDS NOW WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY THE- I THINK THE CRUX OF THE AMENDMENT. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE EDTA TO CONDUCT A FEASIBILITY STUDY S. SPECIFIED. THAT EXAMINES THE IDEA BECAUSE THEN IN TO SELF EMPLOYED INDIVIDUALS. AND REPORTS ON WHAT ACTIONS ARE NECESSARY. TO IMPLEMENT THE EXPANSION. BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE EDT TO COMPLETE. AND SUBMIT THE FEASIBILITY STUDY TO THE LEGISLATURE IN THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON LABOR PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT AND RETIREMENT. BUT DECEMBER ONE TWENTY TWENTY THREE SO THERE'S A- FINITE TIME PERIOD AND- I JUST WANTED. TO GET THAT ON THE RECORD AND- IT ALSO THANK THE AUTHOR AGAIN FOR. WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE IN PARTICULAR COMMITTEE STAFF- YOU KNOW SOMETIMES- SPEAKING LIKE I JUST READ MIGHT SOUND LIKE KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD I DON'T THINK SO- I THINK THIS IS A HUGE ISSUE. I THINK IT'S AHUGE STRUCTURAL ISSUE. IN I THINK WE'VE ASKED FOR THE MOST RAPID TURNAROUND. WE COULD REALLY TO GET A NEW STRUCTURE BEFORE US HERE IN THE COMMITTEE. SO WE KEEP MOVING FORWARD WITH THEM WITH YOUR INTENSE I WANT TO COMMEND YOU FOR THAT. AND- YOU KNOW MAKE SURE. FOLKS KNOW THAT THIS IS VERY REAL. AND- IN WE TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY THANK YOU CENTER DROSE OKAY. YEAH I'M GLAD YOU ENDED UP A WE DID- SYNDROME BECAUSE THIS. THE IS THE BIGGEST. AND THEY A LOT OF REASONS. IT JUST. SIXTEEN SORT OF EXPLODED THE WAY THAT IT DID DURING PANDEMIC OR HEART OF THIS WAS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A MASSIVE. OF ABUSE OF THE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR STATUS. AND SO. MANY I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT NUMBER BUT- MANY. OF WHO SHOULD BE EMPLOYEES IT WOULD BE COVERED WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM- WERE EITHER REQUIRED TO TAKE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR STATUS OR THEY WANTED TO TAKE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR STATUS AND THAT OF COURSE. LEFT THEM OUT OF THE EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE NOBODY WAS PUTTING IN THERE I CAN YOU PICK OUT. EVEN NOT PUTTING IN AND IF YOU FOLLOW THE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR STATUS THERE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AS MANY PEOPLE IMPACTED OVER UP BY THAT SO I THINK THERE'S A NUMBER OF CONNECTED ISSUES. OF THAT I HOPE ARE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY- WOULD BE NICE TO SORT OF GET DIFFERENT PEOPLE'S UP BEFORE YOU DO THAT BEFORE THEY DO THE STUDY IS WHAT THEY THINK SHOULD BE INCLUDED. YOU KNOW IN THAT. OF BUT I KNOW BEING SELF EMPLOYED IS REALLY DIFFERENT FROM BEING AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR WHERE IS THE MONEY GOING TO COME FROM WE JUST HAD- THE NUMBER PROPOSALS ON HOW WE HELP BUSINESSES. ON THE COST OF EDT BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC AND SO THAT'S A LOT THAT'S A LOT TO. PUT INTO IT MHM THE BOTTOM LINE IS I'M SUPPORTING BECAUSE I APPRECIATE THAT YOU PUT IT INTO THIRTY FOUR BEFORE.

FAST FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES TO BE COVERED YOU KNOW- OF THE WAY I WAS WHAT CENTER IN ITALY JUST CLARIFY FOR THE RECORD SO I DON'T MONEY IT UP THAT THE PORTION OF THE MEN'S AT THE MOMENTS THAT I READ WERE.

WILL COME LOOK TO THIS COMMITTEE OFTEN BUT I'VE HAD SOME LUCK HERE. AND I HAVE A THE BILL APPEARED SB FOURTEEN TWENTY. IT'S COMPLICATED BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE TALK ABOUT UNDER CALPERS CURRENT REGULATION. REGULATIONS MEMBERS ARE ALLOWED TO TRANSFER BETWEEN CONTRACTING AGENCIES AND RETAIN THEIR PENSIONS UNDER PUBLIC. EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT FUND. WHEN AN EMPLOYEE'S COMPENSATION IS INCREASED ACTUAL LIVE BILITY RELATED TO THEIR PENSION IS INCREASED AS WELL CURRENTLY ALL PROVISIONS. ALL PREVIOUS EMPLOYERS SHARE THE INCREASEIN ACTUALLY LIABILITY WITH THE CURRENT EMPLOYER IF AN EMPLOYEE'S COMPENSATION IS INCREASED. PREVIOUS EMPLOYERS AGENCIES MAY HAVE TO INCREASE THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO FORMER EMPLOYEES BEYOND THEIR ACTUALLY PROJECTIONS THEY MADE WHEN THEY WERE DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EMPLOYEE. FURTHER WHEN ORIGINAL EMPLOYEES LEAVE FOR THE OTHER AGENCIES AGENCIES SPEND ADDITIONAL TIME AND FUNDS HIRING AND TRAINING NEW EMPLOYEES. THEN THEY MUST INCREASE CONTRIBUTIONS WHEN EMPLOYEES A TRAINED RECEIVE RAISES AT LATER AGENCIES. OUR BILL REQUIRES ENTITIES CONTRACTED WITH CALPERS TO BARE FULL FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY ACTIONS THAT WOULD INCREASE ACTUARIES. LIABILITY FOR A MEMBER'S PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY I HAVE TWO WITNESSES FROM ELDORADO COUNTY FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT CHIEF PAUL DUIT WHO IS THE FINANCIAL AND RISK OFFICER ALONG WITH DIRECTOR PAUL GILCHRIST. WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION FIVE SO I HAVE MY WITNESSES UP. NOTHING THANK YOU SENATOR- CHIEF PAUL DUTCH IF YOU'RE AVAILABLE YOU MAY PROCEED AT THIS TIME. MORNING MY NAME IS PAUL DUTCH AMONG DIVISION CHIEF WITH THE ORANGE COUNTY FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT I'M SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL FOURTEEN TWENTY. ONE TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DESCRIBE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE HAPPENING WITH INDEPENDENTS ABOUT SPECIAL FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICTS SINCE IMPLEMENTATION OF GASPING NUMBER SIXTY EIGHT THE FIX SUMMARIZATION UNFUNDED PENSION LIABILITIES. INDEPENDENT DISTRICTS RECEIVE ROUGHLY 80% OF THE REVENUES FROM AD VALOREM TAXES. THIS LIMITED REVENUE BASIS SIMPLY NOT DESIGNED TO ABSORB INCREASING PENSION LIABILITY COSTS FOR SOME OF HIS LIFE. THE EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN COMPETITIVE SALARY SCHEDULES WITH COMPARABLE AGENCIES. AN ILLUSTRATION HIS PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS CAN BE OBSERVERS WITH THE POPULARITY AN INCLINATION FOR PUBLICATIONS IS TO LEVERAGE PENSION OBLIGATION BONDS SO THEY CAN FREE UP NEAR REVENUES FOR OPERATIONAL COSTS. THE ARGUMENT FOR MAKING CHANGES TO RECIPROCITY FILLED WITH KNOWLEDGE THROUGH FISCAL REALITIES OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN OPPOSE PROP THIRTEEN POSTS YOU ROUGH WORLD. WITH THE SMALLER FORMS OF GOVERNMENT ARE BOUND BY THE FINANCIAL AXIOMS BUT NO AVAILABLE MEANS OF REVENUE RELIEF OTHER THAN ATTEMPTING TO GET A TAX MEASURE PASSED. REQUIRING TWO THIRDS OF VOTER APPROVAL NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FEAT IN TODAY'S INFLATIONARY WORLD. FOR SYSTEM TRULY THE RECIPROCAL MUST BE RECIPROCALLY FARE AND PREDECESSOR AGENCIES HAVE THE PENSION COSTS INCREASED BY ROUGHLY FORTY PERCENT. FOR RESPECTIVE EMPLOYEE FROM SUCCESSOR AGENCY PENSION INDEXING THIS HARDLY SEEMS RECEPTACLE NOTED THAT SEEM OUT PORTABLE. IS THIS MEDICAL SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE ADJUSTED. I RESPECTFULLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONSIDER THE RAMIFICATIONS OF ALLOWING INDEPENDENT SPECIAL FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICTS REMAIN FINANCIALLY CHALLENGED BY THE SCENARIOS. THAT ANY TYPE OF RELIEF MEDICATION WITHOUT YOUR HELP IS INEVITABLE THAT THESE CONTINUE STRAINS. LEAD TO PUBLIC SAFETY SERVICE INSOLVENCY WITHIN YOUR ROLE COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE HAVE A SECOND. OF WITNESSED. OF PAUL GILCHRIST. THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THE CHAIRMAN FOR A LISTENING TEST TODAY- IT ONLY BE A MATTER OF TIME AND I'M PAUL GILCHREST I ASSUME THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR ALREADY COUNTY FIRE AND ICE ON THE FINANCE COMMITTEE THE ONLY BE A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE RURAL AGENCIES LIKE COUNTY FIRE WILL NOT BE PROVIDING FIREFIGHTING SERVICES FOR TAX REVENUE RECEIVED NEARLY ALL THE REVENUE WILL GOING TOWARDS UNFUNDED ACCRUED LIABILITIES. THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT BURDEN WITHIN ALL RULE AGENCIES AND DETRIMENTAL TO THE WELL BEING OF PUBLIC AND PUBLIC LANDS TO THE PUBLIC IN PUBLIC LANDS HOUSING AGENCIES MAINLY FROM- METROPOLITAN AND URBAN AREAS INCREASING SALES SIGNIFICANTLY BY HIRING AT HIGHER WAGES WHICH CONTRIBUTED. TO INCREASED PENSION COSTS. THERE COUNTY FIRE THE FIRE DISTRICT'S ROLE DISTRICTS DO NOT RECEIVE ANY RECIPROCAL VALUE OTHER THAN A LIABILITY THAT THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR SERVICES THAT THEY'RE NOT GAINING. INCREASE PENSION LIABILITIES BECAUSE AND- BECAUSE IMPACTED AGENCIES TO FACE UNSAFE CONDITIONS FROM OF FIREFIGHTERS AND PUBLIC. RURAL AGENCIES ARE BEING FORCED. TO REDUCE STAFFING FROM THREE OO TO EITHER TO- ARE ONE HELLO I THREE OWES AN OSHA STANDARD AND THIS MEANS THAT- BEING ABLE TO EFFECT A RESCUE IS CHALLENGING FOR THE FIREFIGHTERS AND PUTS THEM AT RISK AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC. THE IN TRAGICALLY ELDORADO COUNTY USING VARIOUS LOCAL AGENCIES REDUCE SERVICES TO STAFFING LEVELS TO- AND WHAT AND ONE OF. LEVELS THIS IS TRULY RELATED TO THE WAY I COSTS THAT ARE HAVING TO BE- YOUR FIREFIGHTER ARE ABLE TO FOCUS ON FIRE SUPPRESSION AND PREVENTION 60% OF ALL WILDFIRES. ARE OUR STAFF TO OUR RESOURCES COME FROM THESE A LOCAL AGENCIES AND SO WE'RE DIMINISHING THOSE AGENCIES ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE TO FIGHT WILDFIRES. EL DORADO COUNTY FARM MAINTAINS AN AVERAGE OF SEVENTY NINE CIVILIAN FIREFIGHTER TYPE PERSONNEL. IN OVER THE PAST FIVE TO TEN YEARS. WE HAVE HAD TURNOVER IN THE RATES OF FIFTY THREE AND HUNDRED SEVENTY PERSONNEL THAT ARE LEAVING OUR AGENCY BECAUSE THEY CAN GET PAID MORE BUT WE GAIN THE BENEFIT YET WE HAVE TO PAY THE LIABILITIES. ENCOURAGE THIS COMMITTEE TO PLEASE PASS THIS BILL AND PROVIDE SOME EQUITY FOR- FOR THE LOCAL AGENCIES SO THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO PROTECT OUR WILD LANDS IN THE PUBLIC.

RIGHT I'M I'M ALL MAKE MY OWN- COMMENTS- I'M NOT GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY- WELL UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY THE AUTHOR ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT RECIPROCITY WAS BUILT INTO OUR PUBLIC PENSION SYSTEMS TO PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY REPUBLICAN POISED TO MOVE FROM ONE PUBLIC IMPORT TO ANOTHER WITHOUT FEAR. OF ANY NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES TO THEIR PENSIONS AND ALSO FOR PUBLIC EMPLOYERS TO BENEFIT FROM BEING ABLE TO RECRUIT FROM A STATEWIDE POOL- OF EXPERIENCED PUBLIC SERVANTS WHO OTHERWISE MIGHT NEVER LEAVE THEIR EXISTING EMPLOYER. AND I'M WORRIED THAT THE BILL WILL DISRUPT THAT FLEXIBILITY PRECISELY AT A TIME WHEN MANY PUBLIC EMPLOYERS. ALREADY FACE CHALLENGES ATTRACTING STUFF TO FILL OPEN POSITIONS- I'M I'M CONCERNED THAT BY CREATING DIFFERENT TREATMENT. BY A NEW PUBLIC EMPLOYER BETWEEN JOB APPLICANTS WERE ALREADY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC RETIREMENT SYSTEM AND JOB APPLICANTS WERE NOT THE BILL KRISTOL DISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT TOWARDS. EXISTING PUBLIC EMPLOYEES. FINALLY THE BILL'S UNCLEAR HOW ONE WOULD DETERMINE WHO WOULD DETERMINE. A WINNER CAUSATIVE EMPLOYER HAD PROVIDED COMPOSITION IS ABOVE WHAT WAS REASONABLY EXPECTED. SUCH OF THE COMPOSITION WOULD TRIGGER THE EMPLOYER TO HAVE BEEN IMPACTED EMPLOYER FOR INCREASED PENSION LIABILITY- SO- JUST WANTED TO. A TO SURE WHERE I'M AT- ON THE BILL IN. TURN BACK TO THE COMMITTEE THAT CENTER WHERE. FROM EXCUSE ME THE CHAIR MADE OF MOST OF THE COMMENTS I WAS GOING TO MAKE I WANTED TO IT WE SALUTE THE OFFER FOR MAKING A RUN AT THIS OUT BECAUSE IT'S CLEAR YOU'RE RESPONDING TO YOUR DISTRICT AND IT'S CLEAR THAT THERE ARE- OUR ISSUES MERMAID ONE OF THE MAIN PRACTICAL POINTS I WAS GOING TO MAKE. THAT WAS JUST MENTIONED IS UP PROVIDING AN EMPLOYEE AN INCREASE AS THE ANALYSIS SAYS- THAT- WHEN THE LATER EMPLOYEE PROVIDES THE EMPLOYED INCREASE IN COMPENSATION BEYOND WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN REASONABLY EXPECTED AND AS I WALKED IN THE BILL ANALYSIS I NEVER SAW A CLEAR DEFINITION OF REASONABLY EXPECTED AND I'M SURE. I AM THAT WALK DEFINITION. AS SOMEBODY IN THE MID NINETEEN SEVENTIES WHOSE HARD FOR TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND THEN CLOSED OUT MARCH FIRST FORTY YEARS CREDIT WITH EIGHT YEARS AS A CABINET SECRETARY AND- A AND I'M SURE SANTA CRUZ COUNTY WAS VERY BEGRUDGING ABOUT. HAVING TO HAVE ACTUARIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT MY CABINET SECRETARY. SALARY WISE NEVER THE LAST IT'S HE HE I THINK THE INTERESTING THING TO ME WOULD BE. IS ON THE WHOLE ISSUE OF RECIPROCITY. HAS IT ONLY GONE ONE WAY. AS IT ONLY GONE FROM OF THE FIRE DISTRICT LOSING PEOPLE THAT GO TO HIGHER PAID ONES AND THEN. THE EXACT QUOTE WAS WHAT WAS ANECDOTAL WASN'T DEMONSTRATED TO ME FACT RULING BECAUSE IF IT TURNS OUT THAT THAT FACT IS AN ISSUE EVERYWHERE IN THE STATE CLEARLY DEMONSTRABLE BY THEIR FAX. MAYBE AT SOME POINT WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT IT BUT IT'S IT I FIND IT GOES BACK AND FORTH AND WE HAD TROUBLE WHEN I WAS MAYOR. OVER THE FACT THAT WE WERE A LITTLE COASTAL CITY. AND OVER THE HILL WAS SENATOR CORTESE'S JURISDICTION THAT WOULD HIRE AWAY ARE TRAINED POLICE OFFICERS FOR THIRTY OR FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE A YEAR AFTER WE STRUGGLED WITH THEM TO GET THROUGH THE POST ACADEMY SO I UNDERSTAND THAT. FORTUNATELY A LOT OF THEM WANTED TO LIVE BY THE COAST AND THAT MIGHT COUNTERBALANCE THE ECONOMIC DISADVANTAGE BUT THAT WAS A DISADVANTAGE AND IT WAS ALSO TRUE WITH OUR SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT IN THE SANTA CLARA SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. AND OTHER THINGS SO ARM I RECOGNIZE THAT THIS MAY WELL BE AN ISSUE I JUST DON'T THINK THIS BILL IS FULLY BAKED AND I THINK SOME OF THE FACTS ARE NOT FULLY IN EVIDENCE YET AND- I WOULD BE WILLING OVER THE COURSE OF TIME TO CONTINUE A CONVERSATION BUT- I'M- GOING TO VOTE NO ON THE BILL. TODAY I THINK SOONER LEARN COULD JUST. A QUICK- I REALLY AM SYMPATHETIC TO. THE CASE THAT YOU'VE MADE TODAY IN THE WITNESSES HAVE HAVE MADE TODAY. I THINK THE HARD PART FOR ME SOMEONE HAS BEEN ALLUDED TO HERE. IS THAT THERE'S A STATEWIDE SYSTEM COVERS MILLIONS OF WORKERS IN ALL KINDS OF CLASSIFICATIONS AND JOBS- AND CITIES AND COUNTIES AND DISTRICTS. AND IT'S HARD TO MAKE A DECISION THAT WILL IMPACT POTENTIALLY IMPACT THE WHOLE STATE. FOR WHAT APPEARED TO BE SOME YOU KNOW OF SITUATIONS OF UNFAIRNESS OR GREATER HARDSHIP SO I THINK THAT'S THE PROBLEM TODAY AND I THINK. THIS SHOULD BE A WAY OF ADDRESSING THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP THIS TODAY DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE RIGHT WAY TO DO THAT WHEN THERE'S ISSUE SEEMS LOPSIDED TO FIX IT IN THE WAY THAT WE'RE PROPOSING SO. OKAY SEE NO OTHER- REQUEST BE RECOGNIZE IT YES HELLO I WANT. I MAKE CLOTHES AND I WANTED PERSONAL THANK YOU FOR THE FOR THE CONVERSATION BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL REALLY NEEDS IS A LOT. MORE CONVERSATION AND- SO I MAYBE IT'S FOR THOSE OF US. WHO HAVE BEEN IN THIS LINE OF WORK FOR A LONG TIME. TWENTY FIVE YEARS FOR ME SIXTEEN YEARS ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SO I WANT TO SHARE THEIR THEIR SITUATION AND THIS THIS IS NOT JUST GERMANE TO. ELDORADO COUNTY FIRE THIS IT THIS HAS TO DO WITH COUNTY. THIS HAS TO DO WITH COUNTY JUST HAS TO DO A SPECIAL DISTRICTS- ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO. THERE MAYBE. YOU HAVE YOU'VE HIRED SOMEBODY YOU'VE TRAINED THEM AND THEY MAY WORK. TWENTY YEARS VIEW AND YOU THEIR WAY. THAT YOU'VE YOU'VE ALLOCATED TO EUROPE'S FIRST FOR YOUR AGENCY WHATEVER AGENCIES SAY THAT MAYBE MAYBE BE FIRE MAYBE COUNTY MAY BE A CITY PAYING IN A PURSE. AND THEN IF THEY LEAVE YOUR AGENCY AND THEY GO IN THIS CASE ELDORADO IS NOT VERY FAR FROM SACRAMENTO AND SACRAMENTO PAYS A HECK OF A LOT MORE THAN ELDORADO DOES SO THEY MAY WORK TWENTY YEARS. AND THEN THEY GO THE TOP TWO YEARS OF THEIR PAY THEY GO TO SACRAMENTO FIFTY THOUSAND THIS IS PICKING NUMBER TWO NINETY. OKAY SO THEY PAY SO THEN THEY WERE TWO YEARS IT'S A HARD TOP TWO YEARS OF YOUR- FIRST THAT YOU GET CREDITED FOR. BUT BUT THIS AGENCY THAT AGREED TO PAY FIFTY THOUSAND AND PUT THE MONEY IN FOR FIFTY THOUSAND. HAS TO PAY. ALL THAT TALK TO YEARS BACK FOR THE RETIREMENT OF THAT PLACE SO NOW THAT AGENCY THAT WAS PRUDENT. IN NEGOTIATING WITH THEIR EMPLOYEES IN GOOD FAITH. IS PAYING THAT EXTRA AMOUNT THAT THE ACTUALLY RETIRED OUT FROM THE OTHER AGENCY. NOW ON TOP OF THEIR PROBLEM THERE PROP TO EIGHTEEN THEY CAN'T GO OUT. WITHOUT A TWO THIRDS VOTE THEY CAN'T UP THERE. THERE ARE. ABOUT TO EVEN OFFSET THEIR- OFFSET THE INCREASES THAT THEY THAT ARE FORCED UPON THEM BY THE PERSISTENT. SO IF YOU YOU CAN'T YOUR KANNST YOU AND YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE A SERVICE AT THE SAME TIME. SO WHETHER IT'S A- COUNTY A CITY APARTMENT HE THESE GUYS CAN'T PROVIDEA SERVICE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T RAISE THEIR TAX BASE BECAUSE OF THE CAN YOU TWO THIRDS VOTE. NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO THEY CAN'T RECRUIT BECAUSE OUR COMPETING GETS AGENCIES AROUND THEM. THAT ARE PAYING A HIGHER WAGE SO. LOOK THIS IS COMPLICATED AND THIS IS TOUGH BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY. ALL THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. I HAVE SIXTEEN YEARS IN PERSON MYSELF. IN LASSEN COUNTY AS A SUPERVISOR. IF I WAS TO GO TO WORK FOR AGENCY FOR TWO YEARS LASSEN COUNTY SB ON AT A REALLY HIGH RATE I MADE LIKE THIRTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS AS A SUPERVISOR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS SOMEWHERE FOR TWO YEARS AT IT EMPATE INTO PERSON. MY COUNTY HAS TO PICK UP THAT DELTA. SO THIS IS NOT GERMANE JUST TO MY LITTLE FIRE TO SECURE CAN'T GET CAN'T RAISE THE RATE. BECAUSE OF TWO TO EIGHTEEN PROBLEMS EVENTUALLY THEY'RE GOING TO BE PAYING OUT ALL THEIR- MONEY TO THE RETIREES AND THERE'S GONNA BE NO SERVICE THERE. AND THAT'S NOT JUST UNIQUE TO ELDORADO THAT'S THEIR CASE AND THEY- ACTUALLY OF PEOPLE THAT ARE. REALLY WIDE AND LOOKING TO THE FUTURE TO SEE THAT THAT THIS DOESN'T WORK VERY WELL SO. I KNOW THIS BILL IS NOT GONNA GET OUT HERE TODAY BUT I WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO ASK FOR RECONSIDERATION AND I'D LIKE TO ME IN THE BILL. TO DO A STUDY WE SHOULD LOOK AT HOW WE LOOK AT. THE FUTURE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE IN ELDORADO FIRE DISTRICT OR YOU'RE IN. SAN DIEGO. IT'S IT THERE'S HAS TO BE SOME EQUITY HERE YOU CAN'T. FORCE UPON. AGENCY TO PAY SOMETHING THEY DIDN'T WERE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE FOR. AND YOUR SERVICE SAY THEY TO GO SHE DID IT IN MY IN MY CASE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND IF I READ ENOUGH AYE SPIKE MY RETIREMENT. BECAUSE I WORK TO YOUR SOMEWHERE THEY DIDN'T THEN THEY CAN'T. GET IN THERE STOP TENS OF THOSANDS AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS THESE OUT THERE THERE'S DRIVING. IS THAT OUR DENTIST GAMING THE SYSTEM QUITE FRANKLY THAT THE MONEY WASN'T PAID IN SO I JUST WANTED TO BE WHERE IT'S A BIG PROBLEM AND IT REALLY HURTS WHEN OUR WHEN OUR STOCK MARKET DIPS. AND R. PERS LIABILITIES ARE GONNA SKYROCKET THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN SOON AND I'VE WE'VE% TALKED ABOUT UNFUNDED PENSION LIABILITIES AND IT'S DO A DISSERVICE NOT ONLY TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPECTING THAT RETIREMENT WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS AND SEE HOW WE CAN. LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD SO WE CAN ACTUALLY KEEP PROVIDING THE SERVICES THAT WE NEED TO PROVIDE SO I JUST WANNA SHARE THAT BECAUSE THIS IS A COMPLICATED STUFF AND IT'S NOT EASY. BUT WE ARE GOING TO SEE IN RURAL AREAS- YOU KNOW. THE LOSS OF HER. HE'S HE'S GONNA. YEAH WHY DON'T THEY ALREADY HAVE YOU IS GONNA MAKE A MOTION FOR MY BILL RIGHT NOW. BUT YES SENATOR. THERE'S NO SUCH CENTER SERVICE CENTER NEW. JUST AS OPPOSED POINT OF ORDER CENTER NEW THIS IS US BE RECOGNIZED A DON'T THINK IS- THE PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE HE'S CONSIDERING YOUR REQUIRES- A MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF HIM UNDERSTAND HIS INTENTION PROPERLY SO. WE IF WE DON'T KNOW MEANS THE BILL WOULD JUST CHARGE RIGHT YEAH I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU WERE ALL WE CAN HEAR IT ON THE ON THE- POSTED ON. MAKING IT SEVENTY. RIGHT WE DON'T HAVE I THINK THE PROBLEM IS WE DON'T HAVE A LANGUAGE THAT WOULD CORRESPOND TO YOUR MOTION- YOU KNOW FOR THE COMMITTEE TO ALLOW FOR THE RECORD FOR THE COMMITTEE WOULD TO RELY UPON- SO. THEN IT IS THE ONLY OPTION THERE'S- ALSO. NO WE DON'T WE DON'T TERM SO FIRST OF ALL LET ME LET'S GET BACK TO MORE MATURE CEDAR IN AND IT JUST BEFORE I DO LET ME JUST SAY SINCE THERE WON'T BE IT THE POSSIBLE BE EMOTIONAL SUPPORT- IF. AT ALL HERE- I DO I DO JUST WANT TO SAY. IN TERMS OF THE- THE CALL FOR AWARENESS THAT- IN IT WITH RESPECT TO CENTER LARGE COMMENTS I SERVED ON. SAN JOSE THE THIRD LARGEST CITY IN THE STATE. I SERVED ON BOTH OF THEIR PENSION BOARDS- IN A CERTAIN THE POLICE AND FIRE RETIREMENT BOARD FOR EIGHT STRAIGHT YEARS YOU KNOW BY THE- END IN IT WAS A IT WAS A TRIP IT WAS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. AND WITH SAN JOSE. ON THEIR OWN INITIATIVE. DID BY REFERENDUM- WENT ABOUT TRYING TO DIVEST OTHER PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS AND OTHERS I THOUGHT THAT- BUT WHEN THEY DID THAT. ALL THOSE FOLKS WHO HAD COME IN FROM SANTA CRUZ TO SAN JOSE WENT FLEEING BACKS IT DOES GO IN THE OTHER DIRECTION- IN SALES THEY HAD TO START PICKING UP THOSE SALARIES. FOR PEOPLE THAT WE'RE GOING ALL THE BAY AREA AND ALL OVER THE STATE SO. IT IS COMPLICATED THERE'S- A DISK RIPPLE EFFECT CASCADING EFFECT I WOULD SAY WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO WORRY SIR FOR. TWENTY YEARS IF THERE ARE. ARE INTO. THAT MOVEMENT- ENTER INTO IN ORDER TO BALANCE THEIR BUDGETS IN THEIR OWN CONTRIBUTIONS. THEN THAT'S A HUGE ERROR WENT INTO MISSION ON THEIR PART YOU KNOW THIS THIS ISN'T. THIS ISN'T SURPRISING NEW COSTS THAT COME UP YEAR BY YEAR THESE ARE. THE EXTRAPOLATED OUT IN. YOU KNOW I INSULT IN THE CIRCLE AT. WE SHOULDN'T BE ENGAGING IN DEBATE HERE BUT I JUST WANT YOUKNOW I THINK I'M QUALIFIED. YOU KNOW TO ENGAGE IN A DEBATE WHERE WE DO. SO I TO DO THAT I DO LIKE YOU'RE TRYING TO GO TO CREATE. A STUDY OR SOME INTEREST IN SOME BALANCE. MAYBE MAYBE. AFTER YOU START MOVING THINGS AROUND HYPOTHETICALLY IN A STUDY REALIZE THERE'S A LITTLE BETTER WAY TO DO IT WE JUST DON'T HAVE THAT HERE AND THAT'S ALL I WAS TRYING TO SAY IN MY REMARKS WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE FRAMEWORK IN MY- HUMBLE OPINION- TO PROCEED TODAY. BUT IF I COULD JUST TO SAY SUSPENDED ALREADY I WOULD I. HAD A MOVE THIS. IF. AMENDED TO PROVIDE FOR STARTED IN TWO OF THE PURSUE. THAT POSSIBLE. SO MUCH IS THERE. WELL I FIVE EIGHT- THAT'S FINE- I JUST WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO SAY. IN INTO THINGS I LOOK I'M- I'M GONNA WORK ON THIS I THINK I. NO ONE WE NEED PARITY SOME. WOULDN'T HAVE PARITY AND WHAT THINK WE HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH OUR- EMPLOYEES THAT. THAT THERE IS A RISK. THAT THE RISK IS THAT IF THESE GUYS GO OUT OF BUSINESS. AND THEY THEY DON'T HAVE THE MEANS TO CREATE A PURSE AND IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED. IN THE LITTLE TOWN OF LOYALTON FOR THE FIRST TIME. IN HISTORY OUR STATE WE HAD THIS HAPPEN WHERE THE CITY WENT BANKRUPT. AND THE LADY THAT WAS AT WORK FOR THE CITY FOR FOREVER AND PAID INTO PERSON WAS GETTING. LIKE SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND SHE WENT TO NINETEEN THOUSAND COULD THERE JUST WAS NO MONEY SHE BASICALLY IT TURNS INTO THEIR THEIR THE DEFINED BENEFIT WENT AWAY. AND SO. THAT COULD HAPPEN IN THE END IT COULD HAPPEN REALLY FAST WHEN THE WHEN THE MARKET CHANGES IN THESE. LOCAL AGENCIES ARE REQUIRED TO PUT THE MONEY AND THERE'S NO MONEY THERE. SO LOOK THESE THIS IS REALLY COMPLICATED STUFF I GET THAT I WILL BE BACK. I APPRECIATE I JUST I'M GLAD YOU LISTEN TO THE CONVERSATION BECAUSE THIS IS NOT EASY. BUT IT ALSO IS A PROBLEM YOU THERE COULD. AND IT'S NOT JUST. THE I MEAN IT HAPPENED. REAL IT THEY THEY BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION AND BUT MOST AGENCIES ARE THINK THAT SOMEBODY ELSE IS GONNA TAKE CARE OF IT. LATER ON DOWN THE ROAD. IT'S NOT TRUE THOUGH IS THAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THESE ISSUES SO I JUST APPRECIATE THE DIALOGUE. I KNOW THAT WE GOTTA. PROBABLY SAW ME WAITING IN LINE BUT- I JUST WE'LL BE BACK WE'LL DO SOME SORT OF A STUDY OR SOMETHING THAT GIVES US SOME ACTUARIES WE CAN TALK ABOUT. WHAT'S HAPPENING THESE AGENCIES AND MAYBE COME UP WITH A SOLUTION THAT THERE'S A TIERED SYSTEM OR SOMETHING. GOING INTO IT SO THAT YOU KNOW. THAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY THAT. YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PAY THE BILL BECAUSE YOU REALLY. ALL THE YEARS YOU SERVED AT YOUR LOCAL AGENCY. THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE EXPECTING TO GET WAS WHAT THE- WHAT THE SALARY WAS THERE. NOT TO. SPIKE SALARY. FROM A DIFFERENT AGENCY. AND IT'S NOT FAIR TO THE- AGENCY THAT. THAT YOU WORK FOR BEFORE. WE HAVE TO PICK UP. AGAIN WE APPRECIATE. I THE INTENT OF LOOKING AT IT ACTUALLY I DON'T HIGHVELD. WE APPRECIATE THAT REQUEST. WE DON'T HAVE EMOTIONAL. WE DON'T EMOTIONAL DEPRIVE MAKE WHEN WE DON'T HAVE A MOTION. WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE A MOTION- ON THE BILL TO MOVE THE BILL M. AS PRESENTED- WE CAN'T- WHAT WEEK WITH A MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION IS ESSENTIALLY- INEFFECTUAL BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ANYMORE. SENATE HEARINGS FOR SENATE BILLS SO RECONSIDERING HERE- WOULD WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BE SET BASICALLY AND WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING IN PRINT. OF ALONG THE LINES OF CENTER NEWMAN'S GENEROUS OFFER- YOU KNOW TO MOVE. AN ALTERNATIVE SUCH AS A STUDY BILL AND OBVIOUSLY YOUR IS NOT AS MUCH EXCERPTED SPURTING PROCEDURE IS I AM OR BEYOND SO PERHAPS THERE'S ANOTHER VEHICLE FOR YOU TO. A TO TAKE THAT STUDY IDEA AND- AND MOVED ALONG SOME HELP BUT- THANK YOU FOR ELEVATING THE ISSUE AND WE APPRECIATE BEING HERE. THANK YOU. YES CENTER DRAWS OF. I JUST THEM MAYBE THERE IS SOME. SHORT OF LEGISLATIVE ACTION IS BOTH CENTER CORTESE'S CHAIR OF THE LABOR COMMITTEE AND MYSELF WHO CARES THE SUBPHYLUM. OVER CALPERS AND CAL STIRS- WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO BRAINSTORM A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW TO BRING IT TO THE ATTENTION. AND SEE IF THERE'S SOME WAY SHORT OF LEGISLATION THAT WE CAN. KEEP MOVING THE CONVERSATION THIS IS CERTAINLY THE POTENTIAL FOR INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS LATER IN THE YEAR- YOU KNOW IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANOTHER VEHICLE FOR BRINGING REPORT THANK YOU. OKAY WE ARE GOING TO CALL ON SENATOR LIMÓN AT THIS TIME. ON SB FOURTEEN FIFTY EIGHT CENTER WHENEVER YOUR SITUATION YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU TURN MEMBERS I WANT TO START BY THANKING THE CHAIR HIM THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR ON GOING FEEDBACK ON THIS MEASURE AS IS EVIDENCED IN THE ANALYSIS AND A COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH MY OFFICE TO ADDRESS CONCERNS AND IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES THIS IS DEFINITELY A WORK IN PROGRESS BILL. ACCORDING TO RECENT ANALYSIS OF PAY DATA CALIFORNIA WOMEN IN TWENTY TWENTY LOSS FORTY SIX BILLION DUE TO THE GENDER PAY GAP AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND THE STATE LOST SIXTY ONE BILLION DUE TO THE RACE PAY GAP. THIS DISPARITY IN WAGE GAP IS ALSO REFLECTED IN THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM WHEN THE AVERAGE WEEKLY WAGE IS CAC. FOR PURPOSES OF DISA PAYMENTS. UNDER THE CURRENT LAW THESE BENEFITS ARE BASED ON THE INDIVIDUAL WORKER SALARY. SINCE THERE IS A WELL DOCUMENTED GENDER PAY GAP WOMEN EMPLOYEES RECEIVE LOWER BENEFITS THAN THEIR WHITE MALE COUNTERPARTS. SB FIFTEEN FORTY EIGHT IS AN ATTEMPT TO NARROW THE DESPITE THE TO NARROW THE DISPARITY IN THIS AREA BY REQUIRING THE AVERAGE WEEKLY WAGE TO BE INCREASED BY THE PERCENTAGE OF DISPARITY. IN EARNINGS BETWEEN GENDER IF THE APPLICANTS AVERAGE WEEKLY WAGE IS LESS THAN THAT OF THE OPPOSITE GENDER. FOR EMPLOYERS WITH OVER A HUNDRED EMPLOYEES THIS CORRECTION COULD BE BASED ON DATA REPORTED BY THE EMPLOYER IN ITS DATA REPORT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING. IN ITS FIRST PAY DATA REPORT. THE DFB H. FOUND THAT WOMEN WERE WOEFULLY UNDER REPRESENTED IN THE LOWEST PAY BANDS. FOR EMPLOYERS THAT ARE NOT REQUIRED TO SUBMIT PAY DATA REPORTS THEN THE AVERAGE WEEKLY WAGES INCREASED BY THE PERCENTAGE OF DISPARITY AND EARNING BETWEEN GENDERS AS REPORTED. BY THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR STATISTICS. THE PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL APPLY TO INJURIES OCCURRING ON OR AFTER JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE. CORRECTING THE PAY GAP THROUGH WORKERS COMPENSATION BENEFITS IS A NECESSARY STEP TO INSURE OUR WORKERS ARE COMPENSATED APPROPRIATELY IF THEY ARE INJURED AT WORK. IN CONVERSATIONS WITH MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS OF THIS BILL IT HAS BECOME EVIDENT THAT THERE IS NO DISPUTE THAT THE PAY. GAP EXIST BUT HOW WE NAVIGATE THIS COMPLEX WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM TO ACHIEVE THE INTENDED GOAL OF HELPING INJURED WORKERS WHO ARE RECEIVING LESS WORKERS COMP BENEFITS. JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE WOMEN IS DIFFICULT. AS A RESULT RECOGNIZE THAT THIS BILL REQUIRES ADDITIONAL CONVERSATION AND ON IMPLEMENTATION THAT WILL BE FLUSHED OUT THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. OUT TODAY WE HAVE JASON MARKETS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA'S APPLICANT TOURNEY'S ASSOCIATION AND JESSE GREWAL REPRESENTING UFCW TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. RIGHT THANK YOU CENTER AND WE WILL TURN TO JASON MARCUS- IF JASON'S AVAILABLE- I BELIEVE ON THE COASTLINE YOU MAY HOPE YOU MAY GO IN PROCEEDS TIME. THANK YOU- GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AGAIN MY NAMEIS JASON MARCUS I IN THE PAST PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA APPLICANTS ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION. GROUP OF ATTORNEYS IN CALIFORNIA PROBABLY REPRESENT OUR INJURED WORKERS AND I CURRENTLY CHAIR ARE A LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE. FROM CENTER TO THE MON IT IS UNDISPUTED THAT A WAGE GAP EXISTS BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN THIS WAGE GAP EVEN MORE PRONOUNCED BETWEEN WHITE MEN AD WOMEN OF COLOR. IN ASSEMBLY MON TESTIFIED SINCE WORKERS COMPENSATION BENEFITS ARE BASED ENTIRELY ON THE INJURED WORKERS WAGES THOSE BENEFITS ARE AS A MATTER OF LAW LOWER FOR WOMEN. THAN THEY ARE FOR MEN WHAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU IS WHAT WE CONSIDER TO BE A STRAIGHTFORWARD BILL BY TAKING WASTE OF THIS CALL BY EITHER THE FEDERAL OR CALIFORNIA STATE GOVERNMENT. WE ARE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE WAGE GAP FOR LITERALLY HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF JOB CLASSIFICATIONS THIS DATA IS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ON THE WEBSITE AND IS READILY ACCESSIBLE. THE OPPOSITION TO THEY WILL TELL YOU THAT THIS BILL IS TOO COMPLICATED AND THEN IT WILL RESULT IN DELAYS IN PROCESSING CLAIMS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THIS TO BE TRUE THIS BILL DOES NOTHING TO CHANGE EXISTING LAW- THAT ALL WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS MUST BE REVIEWED AND ACCEPTED OR DENIED WITHIN NINETY DAYS OF THE FILING OF A CLAIM- THIS BILL SIMPLY ADDS ONE ADDITIONAL FACTOR TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE CALCULATION OF THE WORKERS WAGED. A CALCULATION THAT INSURANCE CARRIERS ALREADY PERFORM IN EVERY SINGLE. THE OFFICE ALSO STATED CONCERNS THAT THE BRIDE NATURE OF THE- PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED FEDERAL AND STATE. DATABASES WE DID TAKE THOSE CONCERNS TO HEART AND OFFERED AN AMENDMENT THAT WOULD- INSTEAD CREATE REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION TO THE WAGE GAP- AND THEREFORE CLOSE IT AND WORKERS COMPENSATION- THAT WOULD BE A TWELVE PERCENT. PAY BUMP FOR WOMEN BASED ON THE MOST CURRENT DATA AVAILABLE FROM THE US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. THAT SHOWS THAT WOMEN ON AVERAGE EARN 12% LESS THAN MEN ACROSS CALIFORNIA. UNFORTUNATELY RATHER THAN WORK WITH US ON THOSE AMENDMENTS WE WERE TOLD THAT THOSE MINUTES WERE NOT ACCEPTABLE AND IT'S AMENDED THE BILL WOULD BE PLACED ON THE- CHAMBER OF COMMERCE'S JOB KILLER LIST. WE FIND A LACK OF CORPORATION FRUSTRATING. WHAT WE DO BELIEVE AS A JOB KILLER IS STAGNANT PERMANENT DISABILITY BENEFITS THAT HAVE NOT KEPT UP WITH INFLATION. AND THE FACT THAT WOMEN CONTINUE TO BE PAID LESS THAN MALE THEN THERE MAY COUNTERPARTS. EVEN WHEN THEY GET INJURED THE JOB. WE RESPECT ASK FOR AND VOTE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU FOR TEST. WILL MOVE ON TO- JEFF GREW WHOSE HERE IN THE ROOM THE- MY NAME IS JESSE GRAY WHILE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR WITH THE UNITED FOOD AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS WESTERN STATE COUNCIL. HERE ON BEHALF OF A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND MEMBERS. TESTIFY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB FOURTEEN. EIGHT AND THANK SENATOR LIMÓN FOR AUTHORING THIS MPORTANT MEASURE. AS YOU HEARD FROM THE SENATOR AND THE PREVIOUS WITNESS IT IS UNDISPUTED THAT THE WAGE GAP EXISTS BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN. THIS IS OF PARTICULAR INTEREST TO UFCW BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF OUR MEMBERS ARE WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. AS A RESULT WAGE DISPARITIES THAT IMPACT WOMEN CALIFORNIA. HAVE A DISPARITY IMPACT ON OUR MEMBERSHIP. THIS BILL SEEKS TO REMEDY THE FACT THAT WOMEN RECEIVE LOWER WORKERS COMPENSATION BENEFITS. THAN THEIR MALE CO WORKERS BECAUSE OF THE INEQUALITY WAGE AS- WE KNOW FIRST HAND THAT WOMEN RECEIVE LOWER WAGES LESS FREQUENT PROMOTIONS. AND OFTEN LESS FAVORABLE CHEFS OR ASSIGNMENTS. SINCE BENEFITS ARE BASED ON WAGES IT IS POSSIBLE FOR A FEMALE WORKER TO RECEIVE LAST WORKER COMPENSATION BENEFITS. THAN A MALE CO WORKER WITH A SIMILAR POSITION TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE YOU HAS A SIMILAR WORKPLACE INJURY. WELL YOU SEE W. MEMBERS WORK THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC AS ESSENTIAL FRONTLINE WORKERS. WE BELIEVE IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT INJURED WORKERS PARTICULARLY WOMEN BE GRANTED EQUITABLE WORKERS COMPENSATION BENEFITS. IS FOR THESE REASONS AND MORE WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE ON SB FOURTEEN FIFTY EIGHT THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU- THAT CONCLUDES LEAD SUPPORT WITNESSES OR ANYONE ELSE IN THE ROOM WHO WISHES TO EXPRESS ITS SUPPORT POSITION ON SB FOURTEEN FIFTY EIGHT. MISTER CHAIRMAN VERSION DUSTIN ON BEHALF OF THE TEAMSTERS AND SUPPORT THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. ON SUPPORT IN THE ROOM SEEN NONE OF LOS MODERATOR TO CHECK THE PHONE LINES FOR SUPPORT WITNESSES ON SB FOURTEEN FIFTY EIGHT A PLEASE LET US KNOW THE NUMBER. EIGHT POSTED FAVOR OF SB ONE FOUR. EIGHT FIVE PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THE START. THOSE IN FAVOR OF SB ONE FOUR FIVE EIGHT PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND WE HAVE WHAT AT THIS TIME MISTER CHAIR COREY PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU. LIVE ONE WATCH YOUR LIFE IS OPEN. THE BOARD OF- THE L. ARE WITH THE ONLY TRACE- IT'S JUST GROWING COMPETITION LOCAL. TWENTY TWO- THANK YOU THURS- NO ONE ELSE ON THE LINE IN SUPPORT MODERATOR WILL MOVE ON. PLEASE CONTINUE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU- WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK NOW TO THE OPPOSITION SIDE. AND WE DO HAVE A COUPLE OF OPPOSITION WITNESSES SOME OF THE CALLING ASHLEY HOFFMAN FIRST TO A BLUES HERE IN PERSON. ACTUALLY PAID FOR JUST NINETY GOING FIRST I'M REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF JOINT POWERS AUTHORITIES HERE TODAY AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION OF THE BILL WELCOME JAVA IN OUR PUBLIC EMPLOYERS EMPHATICALLY AGREED WITH THE SENTIMENT OF THE QUALITY IN ALL ASPECTS OF EMPLOYMENT INCLUDING WORKERS COMPENSATION. THIS BILL IS AN ABUSE OF THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM IT WILL DRIVE AND LESS AMOUNT OF LITIGATION WHICH DIVERT LIMITED PUBLIC DOLLARS AWAY FROM THOSE WHO RELY ON ESSENTIAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES. AND IT WILL ULTIMATELY DELAY BENEFITS FOR ALL GENDERS OF WORKERS WHO DESPERATELY NEED THEM WHEN THEIR CLAIM IS LITIGATED. THIS IS AN THERE'S NOT MUCH THAT SIMPLE AND THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA BUT THE CURRENT CALCULATION FOR TEMPORARY AND PERMANENT DISABILITY IS BECAUSE IT'S BASED ON A SIMPLE FORMULA OF ACTUAL WE JUST LOST. THIS BILL WOULD RESULT IN AN EVEN MORE COMPLEX WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM THAT WOULD ESSENTIALLY AT A LAWSUIT TO EVERY CLAIM WHICH WOULD ULTIMATELY BIRD AN INJURED WORKER SEEKING QUICK RESOLUTION TO THEIR CLAIM. AND A DEMONSTRATION OF A QUALITY THE SAME FORMULAS ARE USED FOR ALL GENDERS AND THERE IS NO ADJUSTMENT. FOR RATES BASED UPON THE GENDER OF AN INJURED WORKER. SOME ADDITIONAL CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL IS THIS BILL DOES NOT SPECIFY THAT THE PROPOSED EARNING COMPARISON IS WITHIN THE SAME EMPLOYER RATHER IT REFERS TO A COLLECTION OF SOME EMPLOYERS NATIONALLY. WHO'S DATED DOES NOT CONSIDER REGIONAL RATES OF PAY OR THE EMPLOYER'S OWN PAY STRUCTURES FOR WHICH MANY PUBLIC EMPLOYERS ARE COLLECTIVELY BARGAINED OR DETERMINED BASED ON OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE CLAIMS ADMINISTRATORS KNOWLEDGE. SUCH AS LENGTH OF SERVICE CERTIFICATIONS AND EDUCATION. AUTOMATICALLY INCREASING TAX FREE WORKERS COMPENSATION BENEFITS WITHOUT ANY CHANGES TO ACTUAL WAGES WILL CREATE A DISINCENTIVE FOR WOMEN TO RETURN TO THE WORK FORCE. AND ASKING CLAIMS ADMINISTRATORS TO MAKE DETERMINATION ABOUT WHAT A WOMAN'S RATE OF PAY SHOULD BE MAY BE WELL INTENTIONED BUT IT IS INHERENTLY DISCRIMINATORY TO OTHER GENDER EXPRESSIONS AND IDENTITIES. AND WE'LL SUBJECT EMPLOYERS TO ALL MAY OF JUST. LAWSUIT SINCE THEY ARE BASING A BENEFIT ON SOMEONE'S GENDER ALTERNATELY WERE CONCERNED THAT THE BILL WILL FOSTER INCREASED AND UNNECESSARY LITIGATION WHICH DRIVE UPS CLAIMS COSTS. AND ULTIMATELY NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE INJURED WORKERS OF ALL GENDERS FOR THESE REASONS WERE STRONGLY OPPOSED YOU PLEASE RESTATE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION WE GOT OUR ORDER. YES FAITH FOR JUST THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OKAY I THOUGHT THAT WAS I THOUGHT THAT WAS IT. THANK YOU. THE CALPERS WERE TRANSITION OF JOINT POWERS AUTHORITIES GROW OKAY THANK YOU MOTIVE. A GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ACTUALLY HOFFMAN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN OPPOSITION SB FOURTEEN FIFTY EIGHT STATED PREVIOUSLY THIS BILL WOULD AUTOMATICALLY INCREASE WORKERS COMP BENEFITS BY THE AVERAGE DIFFERENCE IN EARNINGS BETWEEN GENDER EITHER AS REPORTED IN THE EMPLOYERS DEFEATS REPORT OR SECOND ACCORDING TO NATIONAL AVERAGE DATA. SET FORTH BY THE US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR STATISTICS FOR SMALLER COMPANIES OR ENTITIES WHO DO NOT FILE THESE REPORTS THIS MEANS THOSE AUTOMATIC INCREASES WOULD BE DICTATED BY NATIONAL AVERAGE DATA THAT DOES NOT HAVE ANY RELATIONSHIP TO THAT COMPANY AT ALL OR THAT PUBLIC ENTITY. FOR THOSE WHO FILED IF EACH REPORTS THIS DEFUSE REPORTS PROVIDE A BROAD SNAPSHOT OF A MOMENT IN TIME OF WHERE WORKERS FALL INTO TEN BROAD JOB CATEGORIES AND BRAD PAISLEY AND WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT AVERAGE SHOULD BE USED AS A BASIS FOR THESE AUTOMATIC INCREASES- AND I DO WANT TO TAKE A SECOND TO ADDRESS THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE ADDRESS VI&lt;c.cyan&gt; AT SUPPORT WITNESS- YES IT&lt;/c&gt; IS TRUE THAT WE DID BELIEVE THAT THOSE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS ACTUALLY WERE MORE PROBLEMATIC. AND IN THE BILL THAT WAS IN PRINT AND IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS COMMITTEE ACTUALLY AGREED WITH THAT ASSESSMENT AS WELL AND WE DID HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT AN AUTOMATIC 12% INCREASE FOR EVERY- FEMALE INJURED WORKER WOULD POTENTIALLY RUN AFOUL OF THE EQUAL PROTECTION LAW THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION- AGAIN HAD CONCERNS THAT THIS IS BASED ON A NATIONAL AVERAGE IT HAS NO TIRE RELATIONSHIP TO THE COMPANY. AND WOULD EFFECTIVELY REQUIRE THE- WORKERS COMP APPEALS BOARD- TO NOW ALSO HAVE JURISDICTION BASICALLY HAVE TO HOLD AND MANY- TRIAL. FOR EVERY SINGLE. IN ORDER TO HAVE ANY CHANCE OF PUSHING BY AGAINST PERCEPTION. I'M SO FOR THOSE WHO. I OR A NO VOTE TODAY AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. OKAY THANK YOU- WE ARE GOING TO COME BACK TO THE ROOM ITSELF FOR ANYONE ELSE SO PLEASE COME ON FORWARD. MISTER CHAIRMAN CHRISTOPHER KELLY ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CLAIMS PROFESSIONALS ALSO IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE BRIAN LITTLE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION FOR THE REASONS STATED BY THE CHAMBER THANK YOU. I THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN THE ROOM WISHING TO EXPRESS OPPOSITION SEE NO ONE ELSE COMING FORWARD A MODERATOR PLEASE QUEUE UP ANY OPPOSITION WITNESSES ON THE PHONE LINE AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION HE FOURTEENTH. EIGHT PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. WE HAVE LINE ONE TWENTY THREE PLEASE GO AHEAD. MEMBERS PREFERRED COULD OFTEN BE HAVE A PUBLIC RISK INNOVATION SOLUTIONS AND MANAGEMENT IN STRONG OPPOSITION THANK YOU. WE HAVE LINE SIXTY FIVE PLEASE GO AHEAD. THE MORNING CARE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WHENEVER YOU GO HERE ON BEHALF OF THE HEALTHIER HOSPITALS THAT THE STATE ONE OF THE COMMENTS FROM BOTH MY COLLEAGUES ASHLEY HOFFMAN IT BEFORE IT IN RESPECT POPULATION. HE. AND I HAVE NO ONE ELSE THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU MODERATOR- WE ARE GOING TO COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE- LET ME JUST START OFF AND THEN- RECOGNIZE ANY OTHERS- TO THE AUTHOR THANK YOU FOR OF KNOWLEDGE IN THAT THE BILL'S WORK IN PROGRESS IT WAS CERTAINLY- THE SENTIMENT OF. THE COMMITTEE ITSELF- I SUSPECT- PERHAPS SOME SOME MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AS WELL. BESIDES MYSELF- THAT SAID- HERE I AM NOT NECESSARILY TO ALIGN MY COMMENTS WITH THE OPPOSITION OBVIOUSLY THE OPPOSITION MADE A RAISE SOME SOME SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS THAT WE NEED TO BE ADDRESSED GOING FORWARD I THINK- BUT- IT JUST JUST STATING. ONE OF THE ISSUES IN TERMS OF FOR THE FRAME. IF NOT THE METRICS OF THE BILL- ALLOWING EMPLOYERS SOMEHOW- TO JUSTIFY DIFFERENTIALS THAT DON'T HAVE TO DO WITH WITH INOTES PAY EQUITY ISSUES AS AS AS SORT OF AS YOU PRESENTED- AND I THINK AS AS I UNDERSTAND THEM- THERE ARE CERTAINLY. SITUATIONS WHERE WE'RE DIFFERENTIALS MIGHT BE THE DRIVING FACTOR A BONA FIDE ACCEPTED STRUCTURED COULD EVEN BE STEP ORIENTED DIFFERENTIALS THAT PEOPLE ARE WORKING THROUGH IN AND SOMEHOW THERE HAS TO BE A WAY NOT TO GET CAUGHT UP IN THAT IS WHAT THAT AS AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING THAT- THAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT YOU THINK OF. A COMMITTEE STUFF IS BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT AS WELL- IN IN. WELL IF YOU DON'T IT'S GREAT TO HAVE THE IMPETUS OF- YOU KNOW THE WORKERS COMPENSATION. FOLKS ON IN ON ALL SIDES COMING FORWARD TO ELEVATE THIS ISSUE OF EQUITY- OBVIOUSLY NON WORKERS COMP ISSUES. PUT YOU INTO IT SO SIGNIFICANTLY IT'S YOU KNOW I'M STATING THE OBVIOUS- JUST WAGES BENEFITS- IN GENERAL SO SOMEHOW- I GUESS I'M NOT NECESSARILY PUTTING OUT THE CHALLENGE OF FOR ONE AUTHORED TO TRY TO DEAL WITH ALL OF THAT AT ONCE- IN TERMS OF A RE FRAMING OR RESTRUCTURING- BUT IT CERTAINLY NEEDS TO BE. ADDRESS THE WAY I LOOK AT THE BILL- SO- IT'S- SB PUTS ME IN THE POSITION REALLY OF AGAIN HEARING YOU SAY THAT YOUR RECOGNIZE- THE WORK IN PROGRESS NATURE OF THINGS TO GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY CONTINUE THE WORK IN PROGRESS- YOU KNOW I WILL EXTEND WHAT I WOULD CHARACTERIZE AS A COURTESY I BUILT MYSELF READING TO GO FURTHER ALONG- THE BILL AS IN PRINT IS NOT SOMETHING I WOULD SUPPORT LATER ON- BUT HOPEFULLY YOU CAN YOU CAN MANAGE TO WORK THROUGH SOME OF THESE ISSUES IN A IN A VERY PRODUCTIVE WAY- BE ON THIS COMMITTEE- SO WITH THAT SAID I WANT TO RECOGNIZE- OTHERS- ON. ON OUR COMMITTEE HERE CENTER DRAWS A YES- BECAUSE I KNOW HIM AND I KNOW WE WANT. EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR- JUST TO GIVE AN IS AN EXAMPLE I HAVE A BILL ON WHICH REPLENISHMENT ON PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND DISABILITY AND BECAUSE WE KNOW THATTHE LOWER INCOME ARE PRIMARILY WOMEN. AND PEOPLE OF COLOR SO TO INCREASE THAT WHICH REPLENISHMENT A WOULD DO A LOT THAT DOESN'T EXACTLY MORE DIRECTLY SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS A GENDER- PAY INEQUITIES BUT IT'S AN EXAMPLE OF I THINK WHAT WORLD TRYING TO DO TOGETHER SO I TO WILL EXTEND. AN AYE VOTE TODAY BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YOU'RE ALL ABOUT DOING THE RIGHT THING FOR WOMEN. AND- I'M TRYING TO THINK OF ALL THE- THE REASONS OF WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT TO WOMEN- WE KEEP GETTING. YOU KNOW THE SHORT END WHEN IT COMES TO RETIREMENT SICK YOU YOU NAME IT THERE'S NOT A SINGLE ISSUE IN WHICH WOMEN ARE NOT- GET THE SHORT END OF THE STICK. SO KEEP WORKING AT IT- I SUPORT YOU- AND I HOPE WE GET THERE. IN ORDER FOR THANK YOU- IT'S EASY TO ALIGN MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS OF THE OF THE TWO PREVIOUS NUMBERS BECAUSE I THINK IN PARTICULAR THE GOAL HERE IS- ONE THAT WE STRONGLY AGREE ON IT'S QUESTION OF THE BILL ALIGNING WITH THE GOAL. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT A CENTER CORTESE WAS ADDRESSING AND GIVING YOU THE CHANCE TO DO THAT TO HAVE THE CONTENTS OF THE BILL ON AND- USE THAT THROUGH ME. YESTERDAY ANOTHER COMMITTEE I THINK TWICE ASKING PEOPLE WHEN IT WAS SAID THAT IT WAS A WORK IN PROGRESS WHAT THEIR PLAN WAS THE TWO ND BEING A WORK IN PROGRESS I THOUGHT MAYBE. I WOULD ASK IT HOW DO YOU SEE GOING FROM HERE TO WORK SOME OF THESE THINGS OUR DAY IN THE HOPES THAT THAT YOU CAN ADDRESS THE ISSUE. WELL IT A THINK WE'LL CONTINUE THAT TO KIND OF LOOK WORK ONE WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE YOU KNOW HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE IF THERE'S NOT A BILL THERE'S NOT A CONVERSATION AND SO FOR DECADES AS HAS BEEN STATED WE KNOW AND RECOGNIZE THAT WHETHER IT'S BENEFITS WHETHER IT'S RETIREMENT WHETHER IT'S SALARIES. THERE'S A DISCREPANCY AND I THINK THERE'S REALLY ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE THAT HAPPENED YOU KNOW IT TO BE WOMEN IN THE LEGISLATURE SCARING THESE BILLS- TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT IF THERE'S A SYSTEMIC WAY TO CHANGE IT SO TRUTHFULLY I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE ONE COMMITTEE ONE STEP AT A TIME AND WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR THOUGHT LEADERS ARE CHAIRS ARE COMMITTEES. AT TO FIGURE OUT A PATH- WHETHER THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD TODAY- WHETHER IT MOVES FORWARD YOU KNOW BY THE END OF AUGUST THIRTY FIRST I THINK IT'S STILL NEEDS TO BE A CONVERSATION AND WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE ANALYSIS OR INPUT I AM GETTING GET NO WORK SO MY PATHWAY IS TO START HERE. AND SEE HOW FAR I CAN GET A AND I THINK THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT WHETHER IT MAKES IT OUT THIS YEAR OR YOU KNOW IN FUTURE YEARS WE WILL HAVE. A RECORD OF WHAT THE ANALYSIS AND HISTORY AND IS ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE IT I MEAN THEY THE DISCREPANCY AND THE GAPS AREN'T GOING AWAY AND I THINK THE OTHER PIECE THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE IS THAT WHILE WE TRY TO ADVANCE SOME OF THIS YOU KNOW- IN PARTICULAR WITH THE OPPOSITION WHILE THERE'S A RECOGNITION. THAT THERE'S AN ISSUE THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT OF SALUTE SINCE BEING BROUGHT THE T. AND SO I. FEEL THE RESPONSIBILITY- YOU KNOW AS A WOMAN OF COLOR IS A LOT THE NAFCU YOU KNOW IN THE STATE. YOU KNOW. STATISTICALLY LETTING US GET FORTY CENTS SOMETHING CENTS TO THE DOLLAR RIGHT TO THE MIGHT AND- TO SAY HEY. THIS SHOULD BE BROUGHT UP BECAUSE IF THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE GETTING IN THE SALARIES ARE GETTING IT. YOU KNOW IN OTHER PLACES AND SO FOR ME IT'S ABOUT BRINGING FORWARD POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS AND TRYING TO IDENTIFY WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE IT OR NOT- THIS IS ONE SO YOU KNOW ONE POSSIBLE SOLUTION. MAY NOT MAKE IT ALL THE WAY- BUT IT ALSO. I THINK CONTRIBUTES TO THE OVERALL CONVERSATION WHAT CAN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO. TO TRY TO INCH FORWARD ON SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN BROADLY RECOGNIZED. AS A FORTY FIFTY SIXTY YEAR. PROBLEM SO THAT IS MY ANSWER. RIGHT WELL AND IT'S A GOOD ONE THANK YOU FOR. YES SO THANK YOU BOTH- YES OFFERED TO MOVE THE BILL BUT WILL CONTINUE- AND THEY COME BACK TO CENTER DRAWS WITH A PLEASURE SO I'M THE ONLY ONE I. HAVE THE HIGHEST AND VERY VERY FOND- I THINK YOU'RE AN AMAZING AND BEAUTIFUL WOMAN ON SO MANY LEVELS- SO I WANT YOU TO TAKE THIS IN THE MOST- RESPECTFUL AND CORDIAL- WAY BUT- I DO HAVE. CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL AND PRINCIPLE- SB FIFTY FOURTEEN FIFTY FOR THE RECORD. UNDER THIS SPELL. TWO SIMILARLY INJURED WORKERS COULD RECEIVE DIFFERENT TREATMENT UNDER THE LAW SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THEIR GENDER. TO BASE AN INJURED WORKER'S DISABILITY PAYMENT IN HIS OR HER GENDER IS UNFAIR AND DISCRIMINATORY. IT ALSO VIOLATES THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE OF THE US CONSTITUTION. I WOULD LIKE TO ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES TO CONSIDER THE WORK OF THE LATE JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG MOST NOTABLY HER WORK REPRESENTING CHARLES MORITZ. A MAN WHO WAS CARING FOR HIS ELDERLY MOTHER THAT HAD BEEN DENIED CARE GIVING TAX DEDUCTION BECAUSE HE WAS AN UNMARRIED MAN. JUSTICE GINSBURG UNDERSTOOD THAT DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF SEX REGARDLESS ABOUT SEX HARMS EVERYONE. THREE QUALITY WILL NOT BE BORN OUT OF FURTHER INEQUALITY AND FOR THESE REASONS I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THE BILL- AT THIS TIME AND I DO URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO RECONSIDER THEIR VOTE AND VOTE NO. BUT I DO LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE BILL AS IT INVOLVED IN IS YOU WORK FOR BECAUSE I DO YOU KNOW. THAT YOUR INTENT IS ALWAYS ABOUT HAVING CONVERSATIONS AND MOVING THE NEEDLE FORWARD SO ON THAT PRINCIPLE I DO LOOK FORWARD TO SEE HOW THIS BILL INVOLVES AND WHAT YOU'RE ABLE TO DO ON THIS FRONT SO- THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS AND NO OFFENSE TAKEN AND IT'S ACTUALLY THAT EXACT SAME VALUE OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN THAT IS NOT PROTECTED WHERE WE START WITH WAGES SO THE GOOD NEWS IS I HAVE A WAGE BILL AS WELL. THAT ADDRESSES THIS DISCRIMINATION OF PEACE AND SO IT IS A PROBLEM WHEN WOMEN SO THIS IS ABOUT WORKERS COMP AND HISTORY. RATE OF WOMEN NOT. BEING PAID WHAT THEY SHOULD BE PAID THEIR FOR THEIR WORKERS COMP IS ALSO INSUFFICIENT WELL THERE IS A BILL AT TO GET MORE INFORMATION AND DATA IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT PAGE GET. THAT WAGE GAP IS IN TERMS OF SALARY AND SO THIS IS A RIPPLE EFFECT ON AND CERTAINLY TRYING TO APPROACH IT WITH A DIFFERENT LENS IS VERY DIFFICULT BUT IT REALLY IS BASED ON THAT SAME PRINCIPLE THAT IT IS ILLEGAL. TO PAY WOMEN PEOPLE OF COLOR. A DIFFERENT AMOUNT BASED ON RACE AND GENDER AND THAT IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE STILL DESPITE WHATEVER IN PERFECT BILL IS IN FRONT OF YOU. IT IS ABSOLUTELY ABOUT TRYING TO IDENTIFY HOW WE GET TO THE CORE PROBLEM THAT IN THIS STATE IN THIS COUNTRY THERE ARE STILL WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR WHO ARE BEING PAID. LESSER BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE AND GENDER AND DATA. HISTORICAL DATA SHOWING. AND WE ARE TRYING TO FIND OF LEGISLATIVE VEHICLE TO FALL FOR THAT SO I VERY MUCH RESPECT YOUR- OPINIONS AND YOUR COMMENTS. TO SEE NO ONE ELSE WISHING TO BE RECOGNIZED- YOU CAN YOU KNOW JUST OF. I'M GONNA COME BACK TO CLOSE- THE CENTER BUT- YOU KNOW AGAIN JUST JUST FOR THE RECORD I KNOW YOU'VE KNOWLEDGE AT- BUT WE CERTAINLY HAVE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF DID- OFFERED ATTEMPT TO OFFER- AMENDMENTS ON THE BILL AND- IN AGAIN THAT'S WHY- YOU. CERTAINLY YOU KNOW THERE'S AN ARGUMENT THAT YOU GET TIMED OUT AT SOME POINT WE'VE BEEN MOVING PRETTY QUICKLY THROUGH. THROUGH COMMITTEES AND GETTING THE BILL'S HEARD- BUT- THAT SAID- AGAIN IT'S APPRECIATED TO HEAR THAT- AS YOU GO FORWARD AND SENATOR BECAUSE DRAWS- AND- IN OTHER SELF- I. HAVE SPOKEN TO- VERY VERY IMPORTANT YOU KNOW. THIS COMMITTEE STUFF IS CERTAINLY ALWAYS A RESOURCE BUT THE CONTINUE AS YOU SAID- WORKING WITH THOSE COMMITTEE SELF AS OPPOSED TO JUST USING IT AS A VEHICLE FOR DISCUSSION AND- AGAIN YOU SAID THAT I AM JUST. TO INSPECT LISTENING HERE IN A KNOWLEDGE IN THAT- BUT BUT THAT'S THE BASIS- YOU KNOW FOR THE SPORT OF THINK THAT YOU WILL GET TO GET IT OUT TODAY- YOU MAY CLOSE IN AND ADDRESS ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU LIKE TO ADDRESS THERE I'M GONNA LEAVE MY FINAL THOSE LAST COMMENTS AS MY CLOSING SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU- CONSULTANTS- WE HAVE CENTER DRAWS OR ON THE RECORD WITH THE MOTION. THE MOTION IS TO PASS THE FIRST REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS COURTESY HI COURTESY I- CHAU VOGUE FOR TROUBLED NO WRESTLE. THE REST SO I LAYERED HI THERE I NEWMAN. THAT HAS. THREE ONE WITH ONE NOT TWENTY OKAY SO THREE ONE- WITH WITH ONE ABSTAINING ESSENTIALLY SO- THE BILL'S OUT- THAT BRINGS US TO. TWO BILLS SET TO BILLS AND I'M HOPING TO. RESENT IF ALLOWED IN I'M GOING TO TURN THE GAVEL OVER TO. OUR VICE CHAIR. AT THIS TIME. SURE. ONE OKAY TWENTY SIX OF THE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- WELCOME SENATOR CORTESE ARE YOU WILL BE PRESENTING SB ELEVEN TWENTY SIX. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH DURING COLLEAGUES ON THE. IT IS STILL MORNING SOMEHOW IT SEEMS LIKE MID AFTERNOON ALREADY- SO GOOD MORNING AND- OFFICIALLY I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT SB ELEVEN TWENTY SIX SPONSORED BY THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE WITH SUPPORT FROM THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION SMALL BUSINESS CALIFORNIA IN MANY OTHERS SB ELEVEN TWENTY SIX WILL EXPAND ELIGIBILITY TO KELSEY WAS RETIREMENT PROGRAM THROUGH EMPLOYERS WITH AT LEAST ONE EMPLOYEE INSURING INSURING THAT NEARLY EVERY WORKING CALIFORNIANS AS ACCESS TO A WORKPLACE RETIREMENT SAVINGS PROGRAM THE KELSEY RICH RETIREMENT SAVINGS PROGRAM WAS CREATED. BY SENATE BILL TWELVE THIRTY FOUR ASCENDER DELEON TWENTY SIXTEEN WHICH ESTABLISHED A MANDATE FOR CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS TO PARTICIPATE CAL SAVERS THAT THEY HAVE AT LEAST FIVE EMPLOYEES THEY DO NOT SPONSOR A RETIREMENT PLAN KELSEY WAS IS AN AUTOMATIC ENROLLMENT I ALREADY AVAILABLE TO EMPLOYEES IRA I SHOULD SAY WITH NO EMPLOYER OR FUTURE LIABILITY. UNDER EXISTING LAW ONLY EMPLOYERS WITH FIVE OR MORE EMPLOYEES AS THEY JUST SAID- ARE CURRENTLY ELIGIBLE FOR THE KELSEY WAS PROGRAM THIS RESULTS IN THE PROGRAM BE UNAVAILABLE TO THREE QUARTERS OF A MILLION CALIFORNIA WORKERS REPRESENTING ROUGHLY 10% OF THE UNCUT VERSION SB ELEVEN TWENTY SIX WILL CLOSE THAT GAP BY ALLOWING EVEN THE SMALLEST EMPLOYERS FULL ACCESS TO THE PROGRAM. EXPANDING- ELIGIBILITY WELL ALSO REDUCE CA THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYERS HAVE AN AVERAGE AND ABOVE AVERAGE EMPLOYEE COUNT SUPPORT YOU WITH A BOMB BLEW THE CURRENT FIVE EMPLOYEE THRESHOLD FROM YEAR TO YEAR. THIS RESULTS IN EMPLOYERS HAVING TO ADJUST CERTAIN MISTER PRACTICES ACCORDING TO THEIR CURRENT SIZE IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE MANDATE- WE WANT TO CORRECT THAT. FAILURE TO PROPERLY COMPLY WITH THE MANDATE YEARLY COULD RESULT IN PENALTIES OR OTHER ISSUES FOR EMPLOYERS. S. B. ELEVEN TWENTY SIX WOULD CLARIFY AND SIMPLIFY COMPLIANCE FOR ALL EMPLOYEES. BUT WITH US TODAY'S CASEY O'CONNOR REPRESENTED FROM THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU OWN A RESPECTFULLY AS RIVAL TIME THANK YOU SO MUCH AND GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND CENTERS ON THE COMMITTEE I AM CASEY O'CONNOR'S OF LET'S SAY DIRECTOR FOR TREASURE FIONA MASHI IS THE SPONSOR OF THIS AND HER. PROXY AS THE CHAIR OF THE CALIBER OF THE CALCIUM RICH RETIREMENT BOARD I WANT TO THANK YOUR CORTESE FOR LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. AS ONE OF THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICERS OF THE STATE OUR OFFICE IS DEDICATED TO HELPING ALL CALIFORNIANS. ACHIEVE FINANCIAL SECURITY AND ENSURING SMALL BUSINESSES AND THEIR EMPLOYEES HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO THRIVE. AS THE CHAIR OF THE CAL SAVERS BOARD THE TREASURE IS COMMITTED TO THE BOARD'S MISSION TO ENSURE ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE A PATHWAY TO SAVE FINANCIAL SECURITY IN RETIREMENT FOR THEIR FUTURE. PRIVATE RETIREMENT PLANS ARE IMPORTANT BUT COST COMPLEXITY AND LIABILITY ARE OFTEN CITED AS THE TOP REASON EMPLOYERS DO NOT SPONSOR RETIREMENT PLANS. HEALTH SAVERS PROVIDES EMPLOYERS A NO FEE SIMPLE WAY TO HELP THEIR EMPLOYEES SAVE FOR RETIREMENT. AS A SENATOR NOTED DURING THE PANDEMIC WE SAW A LOT OF BUSINESSES FLUCTUATE IN SIZE THEREFORE MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR OUR SMALLEST BUSINESSES WHO FELL BELOW FIVE EMPLOYEES TO KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE STILL IN COMPLIANCE ARE ELIGIBLE FOR CAL SAVERS. WE'VE ALSO HAD TO DENY REQUESTS FROM OUR SMALLEST BUSINESSES WHO TRIED TO JOIN CAL SAVERS MERELY BECAUSE IN THE STATUTE IT SAYS FOR FIVE EMPLOYEES OR MORE WE WANT TO MAKE IT UNDER EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND MORE EQUITABLE FOR ALSO THE SIMPLE BILL IS SHE- TO INCLUDE. ELIGIBLE TO EMPLOYERS WHO HAVE Y. OR MORE EMPLOYEE. EXCLUDING SOLE PROPRIETORS AND I THINK WITH THAT WE ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE IS JUST A SIMPLE CLEAN UP TO MAKE SURE. THAT THIS BILL DOES WHAT IT'S INTENDED TO DO AND OFFER THE SAVINGS PROGRAM TO ALL. AND AS A CENTER NOTED- CAL SAVERS IN ROMAN ON IT IS AUTOMATIC- BUT THESE ACCOUNTS ARE PORTABLE MEANING THAT SAVERS CAN KEEP THEM IF THEY MOVE FROM JOB TO JOB. AND INVESTMENTS ARE EASY AND IS OPT OUT FOR OUR EMPLOYEES SO WITH THAT I WOULD ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND IF ANYONE DOES HAVE QUESTIONS. HE SELASKY IS HERE WHO'S OUR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIBERS.
