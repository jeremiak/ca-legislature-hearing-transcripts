01:24:50.051 --> 01:24:52.153
THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS

01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:53.922
OVER THE LAST DECADE.

01:24:53.988 --> 01:24:55.723
A DECADE AND MAYBE TWELVE YEARS

01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:56.891
DOZEN YEARS.

01:24:56.958 --> 01:25:00.395
HAS ESSENTIALLY GONE FROM HAVING.

01:25:00.462 --> 01:25:01.496
ACTUALLY NO INFORMATION

01:25:01.563 --> 01:25:03.531
TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS SUPPORTING

01:25:03.598 --> 01:25:04.833
ITS OPERATIONS.

01:25:04.899 --> 01:25:06.734
VERY RUDIMENTARY SYSTEMS ON

01:25:06.801 --> 01:25:08.670
CUSTODY SIDE AND NOT ON HEALTH

01:25:08.736 --> 01:25:11.172
CARE. TO HAVING SOME OF THE BEST

01:25:11.239 --> 01:25:13.708
IT SYSTEMS WITHIN THE EXECUTIVE

01:25:13.775 --> 01:25:15.143
BRANCH.

01:25:15.210 --> 01:25:16.444
IT IS NOT THE CASE THAT EVERY

01:25:16.511 --> 01:25:19.280
LARGE I. T. PROGRAM IN THE STATE.

01:25:19.347 --> 01:25:23.084
OF FLOUNDERS OF CDC ARE ACTUALLY

01:25:23.151 --> 01:25:24.819
IS A A PRETTY GOOD EXAMPLE OF A

01:25:24.886 --> 01:25:26.354
DEPARTMENT THAT HAS SUCCESSFULLY

01:25:26.421 --> 01:25:29.157
TRANSITIONED FROM PAPER TO A

MY SECOND.

01:25:33.595 --> 01:25:34.329
INITIATIVE BUT I WANT TO

01:25:34.395 --> 01:25:36.197
HIGHLIGHT -- IS THAT AFTER

01:25:36.264 --> 01:25:38.166
SUBSTANTIAL INTERNAL OPERATION

01:25:38.233 --> 01:25:39.334
LAST YEAR I JOIN WITH

DEVELOP A MEDICATION ASSISTED A

01:25:45.707 --> 01:25:47.876
TREATMENT PROGRAM. TO ADDRESS

01:25:47.942 --> 01:25:49.077
THE SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF

01:25:49.143 --> 01:25:51.880
PATIENTS WITHIN CDC ARE WHO HAVE

01:25:51.946 --> 01:25:54.849
SUBSTANCE AND OR OPIOID USE

01:25:54.916 --> 01:25:56.251
DISORDERS.

01:25:56.317 --> 01:25:57.986
INITIALLY WE WILL BE FOCUSING ON

01:25:58.052 --> 01:25:59.120
THOSE PATIENTS WHO ARE AT THE

01:25:59.187 --> 01:26:02.524
HIGHEST RISK FOR OVERDOSE.

01:26:02.590 --> 01:26:03.291
AS THE MEMBERS OF THIS

01:26:03.358 --> 01:26:05.159
SUBCOMMITTEE NO SUBSTANCE USE

01:26:05.226 --> 01:26:06.261
DISORDER.

01:26:06.327 --> 01:26:08.263
IS A COMPLEX CHRONIC HEALTH

01:26:08.329 --> 01:26:11.199
CONDITION -- IT INVOLVES

01:26:11.266 --> 01:26:12.967
DOPAMINE DYSREGULATION IN THE

01:26:13.034 --> 01:26:15.003
BRAIN THAT CONTROLS REWARD AND

01:26:15.069 --> 01:26:16.304
MOTIVATION.

01:26:16.371 --> 01:26:18.139
IT CAN LEAD TO UNCONTROLLABLE

01:26:18.206 --> 01:26:21.376
CRAVINGS CONTINUED SUBSTANCE USE.

01:26:21.442 --> 01:26:23.745
AND OTHER ABBERTON BEHAVIORS --

01:26:23.811 --> 01:26:24.846
WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO PERMANENT

01:26:24.913 --> 01:26:27.315
DISABILITY PREMATURE DEATH.

01:26:27.382 --> 01:26:29.450
AND OTHER ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES

01:26:29.517 --> 01:26:31.920
FOR AFFLICTED INDIVIDUALS

01:26:31.986 --> 01:26:33.755
FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES.

01:26:33.821 --> 01:26:35.623
IN RECENT YEARS OPIOID USE

01:26:35.690 --> 01:26:37.792
DISORDER IS THE PRIMARY

01:26:37.859 --> 01:26:39.160
SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER

01:26:39.227 --> 01:26:40.728
ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASES IN

01:26:40.795 --> 01:26:43.498
FATAL AND NONFATAL OVERDOSES

01:26:43.565 --> 01:26:44.666
NATIONALLY.

01:26:44.732 --> 01:26:46.834

TAMBIéN CDC ARE.

01:26:49.137 --> 01:26:50.338
IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THE

01:26:50.405 --> 01:26:51.606
PREVALENCE OF SUBSTANCE USE

01:26:51.673 --> 01:26:53.207
DISORDER AMONG THE CDC OUR

01:26:53.274 --> 01:26:57.478

01:26:57.545 --> 01:26:59.080
BUT A FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND

INMATES.

01:26:59.914 --> 01:27:02.517
AND THAT AT LEAST 26%.

01:27:02.584 --> 01:27:04.886
OF PATIENTS WITH SUBSTANCE USE

01:27:04.953 --> 01:27:07.088
DISORDER HAVE AN OPIOID USE

ALTHOUGH MOST OF THE BEHAVIORAL

01:27:21.002 --> 01:27:22.971
THERAPY SERVICES ARE BASED ON

01:27:23.037 --> 01:27:24.272
MODELS THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO

01:27:35.850 --> 01:27:37.218
UNKNOWN.

01:27:37.285 --> 01:27:38.920
THE DATA JUST HASN'T BEEN

01:27:38.987 --> 01:27:40.388
COLLECTED AND ANALYZED.

01:27:40.455 --> 01:27:41.856
ADDITIONALLY THE CURRENT S. U.

IS NOT BASED ON A MEDICAL

01:27:47.362 --> 01:27:49.230
CHRONIC CARE MODEL.

01:27:49.297 --> 01:27:50.932
INSTEAD THE TREATMENT DURATION

01:27:50.999 --> 01:27:53.067
IS ONLY FIVE MONTHS.

01:27:53.134 --> 01:27:54.502
AND CURRENT AVAILABLE TREATMENT

01:27:54.569 --> 01:27:57.171
CAPACITY IS LESS THAN TWELVE

01:27:57.238 --> 01:28:00.441
THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS PER YEAR.

01:28:00.508 --> 01:28:03.244
WE WILL BE PROPOSING -- LATER

THERAPY WITH MEDICATION AND

01:28:13.521 --> 01:28:15.023
BEHAVIOR INTERVENTIONS.

01:28:15.089 --> 01:28:17.091
THAT ARE BEST DELIVERED IN AN

01:28:17.158 --> 01:28:18.626
INTEGRATED HEALTH CARE SETTING.

01:28:18.693 --> 01:28:20.828
USING INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAMS

01:28:20.895 --> 01:28:21.629
WHO WILL TAKE CARE OF THEIR

01:28:21.696 --> 01:28:23.398

CONTINUUM OF CARE.

01:28:25.967 --> 01:28:27.435
THIS APPROACH WILL PROVIDE A

01:28:27.502 --> 01:28:29.404
GREATER OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE

TREATMENTS.

01:28:36.310 --> 01:28:37.879
AND THAT IN TURN WILL ALLOW

01:28:37.945 --> 01:28:39.847
BETTER COST CONTROL AND TO

01:28:39.914 --> 01:28:42.150
PROMOTE BETTER POSITIVE OUTCOMES

CUSTODY.

01:29:04.038 --> 01:29:04.605
AND THAT WILL REQUIRE

ANALYST'S OFFICE -- REVIEWING

01:33:11.152 --> 01:33:12.153
THIS PROPOSAL WE IDENTIFIED A

01:33:12.219 --> 01:33:13.454
FEW QUESTIONS WHICH MADE IT

01:33:13.521 --> 01:33:14.722
DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE LEVEL

01:33:14.789 --> 01:33:19.694
FUNDING NECESSARY IN -- TWENTY

01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:20.261
NINETEEN NAMELY IT'S UNCLEAR

01:33:20.328 --> 01:33:22.563
WHAT THE VACANCIES ARE IN THREE

01:33:22.630 --> 01:33:25.199
D. C. R. I. AND HEALTHCARE

01:33:25.266 --> 01:33:25.933
SYSTEM FOR HOME VISITORS

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.302
ESPECIALLY AROUND THE PRIMARY

01:33:28.369 --> 01:33:29.804
CARE PHYSICIANS -- AND THE

01:33:29.870 --> 01:33:30.905
PROPOSAL THEY SAY THAT THAT I'VE

01:33:30.972 --> 01:33:31.973
STOPPED THIRTY POINT THREE

01:33:32.039 --> 01:33:33.908
POSITIONS OVER THE AUTHORIZED

01:33:33.975 --> 01:33:35.009
AMOUNT.

01:33:35.076 --> 01:33:36.043
OF ON THE SAME PROPOSAL AS A

01:33:36.110 --> 01:33:37.979
FOOTNOTE SAYING THAT THE 10%

01:33:38.045 --> 01:33:39.480
COMMISSION BUT THEY CAN SEE.

01:33:39.547 --> 01:33:41.482
AND A SEPARATE PROPOSAL IN

01:33:41.549 --> 01:33:43.084
JANUARY THEY MENTION AND 18%

01:33:43.150 --> 01:33:45.753
VACANCY RATE FOR THE PRIMARY

01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:47.621
CARE PHYSICIANS.

01:33:47.688 --> 01:33:48.456
SO IT'S UNCLEAR IF THAT'S

01:33:48.522 --> 01:33:49.090
POTENTIAL SALARY SAVINGS THAT

01:33:49.156 --> 01:33:50.358
CAN BE APPLIED TOWARDS THIS IN

01:33:50.424 --> 01:33:52.026
THE UPCOMING BUDGET YOUR IN

01:33:52.093 --> 01:33:53.861
ADDITION IT'S NOT CLEAR WHY DOES

01:33:53.928 --> 01:33:55.863
NOT INCREASE AND THE FEDERAL

01:33:55.930 --> 01:33:57.398
REIMBURSEMENT RATE THAT WOULD BE

01:33:57.465 --> 01:33:59.567
AUTHORIZED -- LARGE AMOUNT OF

01:33:59.633 --> 01:34:00.868
THE INCREASE COSTS OF RELATED TO

01:34:00.935 --> 01:34:03.471
INPATIENT -- KELLER.

01:34:03.537 --> 01:34:05.072
AND THAT WOULD BE ATTENTION TO

01:34:05.139 --> 01:34:06.340
BE ELIGIBLE.

01:34:06.407 --> 01:34:12.780
FOR MEDICAID COVERAGE OKAY THANK.

01:34:12.847 --> 01:34:14.448
I'M INTERNET YES THE ON STAFF.

01:34:14.515 --> 01:34:15.649
AND MEDICARE -- THIS IS A VERY

01:34:15.716 --> 01:34:16.484
MUCH DOWN IN THE WEEDS HOW DO

01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:17.485
YOU COUNT VARIOUS NUMBERS -- WE

01:34:17.551 --> 01:34:18.753
GOT INFORMATION TO THE

01:34:18.819 --> 01:34:20.521
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE A LITTLE

01:34:20.588 --> 01:34:22.523
LATE IN THE PROCESS I AND I

01:34:22.590 --> 01:34:24.058
THINK -- LET'S FROM ANALYST'S

01:34:24.125 --> 01:34:25.926
OFFICE DID NOT HAVE SOME OF OUR

01:34:25.993 --> 01:34:28.496
MOST RECENT INFORMATION THAT

01:34:28.562 --> 01:34:31.599
MORE CLEARLY EXPLAINS THE ISSUES

01:34:31.665 --> 01:34:33.901
THAT LA -- HAS IDENTIFIED -- I

01:34:33.968 --> 01:34:35.336
BELIEVE WE HAVE NOW SUPPLY THAT

01:34:35.403 --> 01:34:37.138
INFORMATION TO FINANCE AND THEY

01:34:37.204 --> 01:34:39.407
HAVE SUPPLY AND NEW INFORMATION

01:34:39.473 --> 01:34:40.875
THE LA -- HAVE THAT YET.

01:34:40.941 --> 01:34:43.110
OKAY THEY HAVE I WOULD SUGGEST

01:34:43.177 --> 01:34:44.111
DUBBED BEFORE WE TAKE THE

01:34:44.178 --> 01:34:45.679
COMMITTEE'S TIME UNLESS YOU

01:34:45.746 --> 01:34:47.248
REALLY WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THE

01:34:47.314 --> 01:34:49.116
DETAILS OF THESE NUMBERS -- THE

01:34:49.183 --> 01:34:52.820
PERHAPS WE LET STAFF.

01:34:52.887 --> 01:34:53.587
I HAVE ANOTHER CONVERSATION

01:34:53.654 --> 01:34:55.723
WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN RESOLVE THE

01:34:55.790 --> 01:34:57.258
APPARENT DISCREPANCIES I'M NOT

01:34:57.324 --> 01:34:58.893
DENYING THERE WERE DISCREPANCIES

01:34:58.959 --> 01:34:59.460
THAT.

01:34:59.527 --> 01:35:00.928
YOU WOULD RALLY -- WAS

01:35:00.995 --> 01:35:02.763
IDENTIFIED I JUST THINK THAT --

01:35:02.830 --> 01:35:03.998
IT IT REALLY IS A STAFF

01:35:04.065 --> 01:35:05.433
DISCUSSION THAT WE CAN RESULT

01:35:05.499 --> 01:35:07.401
YOU JUST GOT RESCUED BUT THAT'S

01:35:07.468 --> 01:35:09.737
OKAY.

01:35:09.804 --> 01:35:10.304
OTHERWISE WE'RE GOING TO WE

01:35:10.371 --> 01:35:12.173
DISCUSSION.

01:35:12.239 --> 01:35:13.641
JUST A QUICK QUESTION YOU DID

01:35:13.707 --> 01:35:15.376
GET THE OF NEW INFORMATION WE WE

01:35:15.443 --> 01:35:17.344
RECEIVED INFORMATION ON THAT

01:35:17.411 --> 01:35:18.913
HALF IN LEVEL THERE IS A

01:35:18.979 --> 01:35:20.481
COMPONENT OF THE FUNDING THAT

01:35:20.548 --> 01:35:22.016
DIDN'T MATCH UP WITH THE AMOUNT

01:35:22.083 --> 01:35:23.651
OF THE BUDGET -- WE DID RECEIVE

01:35:23.717 --> 01:35:24.885
INFORMATION ON WHAT THOSE

01:35:24.952 --> 01:35:26.620
ADDITIONAL COSTS FOR AND THAT

01:35:26.687 --> 01:35:27.888
HAS BEEN CLARIFIED BUT I STILL

01:35:27.955 --> 01:35:29.957
QUESTIONS IN TERMS OF THAT

01:35:30.024 --> 01:35:31.759
VACANCY RATES FOR THE PRIMARY

01:35:31.826 --> 01:35:33.727
CARE PHYSICIANS AND WHY FEDERAL

01:35:33.794 --> 01:35:34.795
REIMBURSEMENTS AREN'T BEING

01:35:34.862 --> 01:35:35.096
INCREASED.

01:35:35.162 --> 01:35:37.898
OKAY SO YOU UNDERSTAND OKAY YES

01:35:37.965 --> 01:35:39.600
WITH THE VACANCY RATES -- BUT WE

01:35:39.667 --> 01:35:41.635
DID THE PROPOSAL FOR THE BCP FOR

01:35:41.702 --> 01:35:43.337
THE APP WOULDN'T INCLUDE THE

01:35:43.404 --> 01:35:46.474
TELEMEDICINE PCP POSITIONS AND

01:35:46.540 --> 01:35:47.942
THAT INCREASED INFLATED OUR

01:35:48.008 --> 01:35:49.710
VACANCY RATE -- BECAUSE WE

01:35:49.777 --> 01:35:51.879
HADN'T INCLUDED THOSE -- WHEN WE

01:35:51.946 --> 01:35:53.447
DID THE CURRENT PROPOSAL WE

01:35:53.514 --> 01:35:55.149
DIDN'T INCLUDE THE THE

01:35:55.216 --> 01:35:56.016
TELEMEDICINE WHICH BROADER

01:35:56.083 --> 01:35:57.284
VACANCY RATE DOWN WHICH IS

01:35:57.351 --> 01:36:00.888
CURRENTLY AT FOUR POINT 6% -- SO

01:36:00.955 --> 01:36:03.057
VERY MINIMAL -- IN VERY MINIMAL

01:36:03.124 --> 01:36:05.092
SAVINGS THERE -- AS FAR AS THE

01:36:05.159 --> 01:36:06.727
REIMBURSEMENT -- WE'RE ALWAYS

01:36:06.794 --> 01:36:08.229
LOOKING AT WAYS TO GET MORE

01:36:08.295 --> 01:36:10.564
REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE FEDS --

01:36:10.631 --> 01:36:12.700
UNFORTUNATELY IT'S OF IT'S A

01:36:12.766 --> 01:36:14.368
LENGTHY PROCESS TO GET THAT

01:36:14.435 --> 01:36:16.370
REIMBURSEMENT IT TAKES SOMETIMES

01:36:16.437 --> 01:36:17.638
UP TO TWO YEARS.

01:36:17.705 --> 01:36:19.673
AND SO WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE

01:36:19.740 --> 01:36:22.209
INCREASES IN OUR REIMBURSEMENT

01:36:22.276 --> 01:36:23.644
TO TO DRIVE US TO GO AND ASK FOR

01:36:23.711 --> 01:36:25.779
ADDITIONAL REIMBURSEMENT -- AS

01:36:25.846 --> 01:36:27.481
WE GET CAUGHT UP IN WE SEE THOSE

01:36:27.548 --> 01:36:29.650
INCREASES WILL COME BACK AND AN

01:36:29.717 --> 01:36:31.519
INCREASE THAT IF POSSIBLE -- BUT

01:36:31.585 --> 01:36:34.255
RIGHT NOW WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE

01:36:34.321 --> 01:36:35.222
OPTICS.

01:36:35.289 --> 01:36:37.958
NOT EVERY IN MAY QUALIFIES FOR

01:36:38.025 --> 01:36:40.227
MEDI CAL -- WHICH IS ONE ISSUE

01:36:40.294 --> 01:36:41.862
WE ONLY GET REIMBURSED FOR

01:36:41.929 --> 01:36:44.131
CERTAIN SERVICES AND THEY'RE

01:36:44.198 --> 01:36:46.167
SLOWLY -- REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF

01:36:46.233 --> 01:36:47.501
REIMBURSEMENT RATE THEY STARTED

01:36:47.568 --> 01:36:49.670
A 100% AND I BELIEVE IT'S DOWN

01:36:49.737 --> 01:36:51.906
CLOSER TO ABOUT 93%.

01:36:51.972 --> 01:36:54.108
AND NEXT YEAR WILL BE GOING 290%

01:36:54.175 --> 01:36:56.977
SO THOSE FACTORS HAVE MADE IT

01:36:57.044 --> 01:36:58.812
DIFFICULT FOR US TO TO COME

01:36:58.879 --> 01:37:00.848
FORWARD AND MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT

01:37:00.915 --> 01:37:06.187

01:52:35.915 --> 01:52:38.251
ARENAS ADDITIONALLY I THINK

01:52:38.318 --> 01:52:42.589
THERE'S A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY

01:52:42.655 --> 01:52:44.324

THROUGHOUT OUR STATE IN OUR

01:52:52.899 --> 01:52:55.135
COUNTIES IN OTHER CITIES. TO TO

01:52:55.201 --> 01:52:56.936
REALLY BE CALM RECEIVING CENTERS

FOR THOSE YOUTH WITH A WITH A

01:52:58.738 --> 01:53:00.773
REALLY STRONG PLAN FOR ACTION

01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:02.809
THAT FOCUSES ON THAT COMMUNITY

01:53:02.876 --> 01:53:05.512
REINTEGRATION AND RESTORATION --

01:53:05.578 --> 01:53:07.113
THERE'S A REAL CHANCE TO DO THIS

01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:09.449
IN AN INCREDIBLE WAY TO NOT ONLY

01:53:09.516 --> 01:53:11.384
CATCH UP WITH OTHER PLACES ARE

01:53:11.451 --> 01:53:13.153
ARE ACROSS THE COUNTRY BUT TO

REALLY BECOME A LEADER IN THIS

01:53:15.255 --> 01:53:19.025
AREA -- I WAS I WAS IMPRESSED BY --

01:53:19.092 --> 01:53:21.327
THE YOUTH SAID I HAD A CHANCE TO

FIGURING OUT WHICH OPPORTUNITIES

01:53:27.901 --> 01:53:30.136
WERE AVAILABLE AND I THINK WE

01:53:30.203 --> 01:53:33.139
HAVE THE THE THE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:53:33.206 --> 01:53:34.541
TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND HEALTH

01:53:34.607 --> 01:53:35.575

A VERY SUCCESSFUL AND SEAMLESS

01:53:45.885 --> 01:53:48.588
WAY AND SUPPORT THE STAFF TO

01:53:48.655 --> 01:53:50.290
BUILD ON SUCCESS IS THAT THEY

01:53:50.356 --> 01:53:51.524
ALREADY HAVE.

01:53:51.591 --> 01:53:53.860
I LOOK FORWARD TO TO MAKING THAT

01:53:53.927 --> 01:53:56.663
HAPPEN AND SUPPORTING -- THIS

01:53:56.729 --> 01:53:59.299
TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY.

01:53:59.365 --> 01:54:03.102
MOVE CALIFORNIA FORWARD IN A

01:54:03.169 --> 01:54:05.338

01:54:14.781 --> 01:54:17.717
SINCE OUR FOUNDING IN NINETEEN

01:54:17.784 --> 01:54:19.619
EIGHTY FIVE CJ CJ HAS WORKED

01:54:19.686 --> 01:54:21.621
WITH YOUNG PEOPLE BOUND FOR THE

STATE YOUTH CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM.

01:54:24.524 --> 01:54:26.359
AND WE'VE CLOSELY MONITORED

01:54:26.426 --> 01:54:28.428
CONDITIONS IN THE FACILITIES

01:54:28.494 --> 01:54:31.331
IN FEBRUARY WE RELEASED A REPORT

01:54:31.397 --> 01:54:31.931
WHICH I BELIEVE YOU HAVE IN

01:54:31.998 --> 01:54:32.832
FRONT OF YOU.

01:54:32.899 --> 01:54:34.801
DETAILING HOW EVERYDAY LIFE HAS

01:54:34.867 --> 01:54:36.903
CHANGED FOR YOU SINCE THE STATE

01:54:36.970 --> 01:54:38.304
WAS RELEASED.

01:54:38.371 --> 01:54:40.073
FROM A YEARS LONG CONDITIONS

01:54:40.139 --> 01:54:43.977
LAWSUIT CALLED THE FERAL LAWSUIT.

01:54:44.043 --> 01:54:45.545
FERRELL BEGAN IN THE EARLY TWO

01:54:45.612 --> 01:54:48.081
THOUSANDS IN RESPONSE TO

01:54:48.147 --> 01:54:49.949
HORRIFIC ABUSES IN THE

01:54:50.016 --> 01:54:51.851
INSTITUTIONS AND IT LASTED FOR

01:54:51.918 --> 01:54:53.653
MORE THAN A DECADE.

01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:56.189
HOWEVER SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN THE

01:54:56.256 --> 01:54:57.957
DJJ FACILITIES HAVE SEEN AN

01:54:58.024 --> 01:55:00.660
ABRUPT END. TO THE REPORTING

01:55:00.727 --> 01:55:03.463
INSPECTIONS AND ACCOUNTABILITY

01:55:03.529 --> 01:55:05.231
REQUIRED UNDER FERAL

01:55:05.298 --> 01:55:05.531
[inaudible]

01:55:05.598 --> 01:55:07.934
NOW NO SINGLE OVERSIGHT BODY

01:55:08.001 --> 01:55:11.137
EXISTS TO ENSURE THE DJJ IS

01:55:11.204 --> 01:55:14.007
FULFILLING ITS BASIC OBLIGATION.

01:55:14.073 --> 01:55:15.441
TO KEEP YOU SAFE.

01:55:15.508 --> 01:55:17.143
AND TO PREPARE THEM TO RETURN

01:55:17.210 --> 01:55:19.012
HOME.

01:55:19.078 --> 01:55:20.980
OUR RESEARCH EVALUATED ALL

01:55:21.047 --> 01:55:23.349
ASPECTS OF LIFE AT DJJ.

01:55:23.416 --> 01:55:25.985
FROM INTAKE TO RE ENTRY.

01:55:26.052 --> 01:55:29.922
AND A FEW KEY THEMES EMERGED.

01:55:29.989 --> 01:55:32.125
ONE BUT THE DJJ INSTITUTIONS

01:55:32.191 --> 01:55:35.628
REMAIN DOMINATED BY A CULTURE OF

01:55:35.695 --> 01:55:38.531
VIOLENCE AND FEAR. TWO THAT

01:55:38.598 --> 01:55:40.933
YOUTH ARE ROUTINELY ISOLATED.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:42.235
BOTH FROM HEALTHY SOCIAL

01:55:42.302 --> 01:55:43.936
INTERACTIONS AND FROM THEIR

01:55:44.003 --> 01:55:47.307
FAMILIES BACK ON AND THREE THE

01:55:47.373 --> 01:55:50.243
DJJ IS INHERENTLY NON

01:55:50.310 --> 01:55:53.880
REHABILITATIVE. FOR YOUTH IN DJJ

01:55:53.946 --> 01:55:55.648
VIOLENCE IS A PART OF THEIR

01:55:55.715 --> 01:55:56.816
DAILY LIVES.

01:55:56.883 --> 01:55:59.686
ON AVERAGE THIRTY THREE YOUTH

01:55:59.752 --> 01:56:01.554
PER HUNDRED IN THE FACILITIES

01:56:01.621 --> 01:56:04.257
ARE INVOLVED IN FIGHTS BEATINGS

01:56:04.324 --> 01:56:06.459
OR RIGHTS EACH MONTH.

01:56:06.526 --> 01:56:08.227
AND THERE'S ALSO BEEN A DRAMATIC

01:56:08.294 --> 01:56:11.564
SPIKE IN USE OF FORCE BY STAFF.

01:56:11.631 --> 01:56:13.199
WITH THE RATE THAT'S INCREASED

01:56:13.266 --> 01:56:14.767
NEARLY THREE FOLD SINCE THE END

01:56:14.834 --> 01:56:17.670
OF FERAL [inaudible]

01:56:17.737 --> 01:56:19.238
DJJ.

01:56:19.305 --> 01:56:21.007
FRANKLY IS DOMINATED BY CULTURE

01:56:21.074 --> 01:56:23.209
OF FEAR THE PLACE IS YOUTH ON

01:56:23.276 --> 01:56:25.445
HIGH ALERT AND EXACTS.

01:56:25.511 --> 01:56:28.915
A SIGNIFICANT PSYCHOLOGICAL TOLL.

01:56:28.981 --> 01:56:31.117
AND STAFF OFTEN RESPOND TO THIS

01:56:31.184 --> 01:56:33.353
VIOLENCE BY ISOLATING YOUTH.

01:56:33.419 --> 01:56:35.455
AND DEPRIVING THEM OF HEALTHY

01:56:35.521 --> 01:56:37.724
SOCIAL INTERACTIONS.

01:56:37.790 --> 01:56:39.425
IN THE MOST EXTREME EXAMPLE OF

01:56:39.492 --> 01:56:41.994
THIS IS THE BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT

01:56:42.061 --> 01:56:43.496
PROGRAM BTP.

01:56:43.563 --> 01:56:45.164
WHICH PLACES YOUTH IN RELATIVE

01:56:45.231 --> 01:56:48.134
ISOLATION FOR WEEKS MONTHS AND

01:56:48.201 --> 01:56:50.036
SOMETIMES EVEN YEARS ON AND

01:56:50.103 --> 01:56:51.537
PROFOUNDLY AFFECTING THEIR

01:56:51.604 --> 01:56:54.674
HEALTH AND WELL BEING.

01:56:54.741 --> 01:56:56.843
AND BECAUSE DJJ IS REMOTELY

01:56:56.909 --> 01:56:58.444
LOCATED.

01:56:58.511 --> 01:57:00.413
MANY YOUTH ARE ALSO ISOLATED

01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:01.547
FROM THEIR FAMILIES AND

01:57:01.614 --> 01:57:03.316
COMMUNITIES BACK CALL.

01:57:03.383 --> 01:57:04.851
APPROXIMATELY HALF OF YOU THE

01:57:04.917 --> 01:57:07.420
DJJ ARE PLACED MORE THAN A

01:57:07.487 --> 01:57:09.155
HUNDRED MILES FROM THEIR HOME

01:57:09.222 --> 01:57:10.423
COUNTIES WHICH MAKES IT

01:57:10.490 --> 01:57:12.725
DIFFICULT FOR THEM. TO MAINTAIN

01:57:12.792 --> 01:57:14.427
A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH LOVED

01:57:14.494 --> 01:57:16.429
ONES DURING THIS CRITICAL PERIOD

01:57:16.496 --> 01:57:19.332
IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT.

01:57:19.399 --> 01:57:21.267
SO BOTH THE ISOLATION AND

01:57:21.334 --> 01:57:23.970
VIOLENCE YOUTH EXPERIENCE AT DJJ

01:57:24.036 --> 01:57:26.239
DIRECTLY UNDERMINES ITS

01:57:26.305 --> 01:57:27.974
REHABILITATIVE AIMS.

01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:31.511
AND THE RESULT IS POOR OUTCOMES.

01:57:31.577 --> 01:57:33.112
SO THREE QUARTERS OF YOUTH ARE

01:57:33.179 --> 01:57:36.182
RE ARRESTED MORE THAN HALF A RE

01:57:36.249 --> 01:57:38.217
CONVICTED AND MORE THAN A THIRD

01:57:38.284 --> 01:57:40.953
RETURN TO STATE CUSTODY WITHIN

01:57:41.020 --> 01:57:43.256
THREE YEARS OF RELEASE FROM DJJ.

01:57:43.322 --> 01:57:44.457
AND OUR SURVEY FOUND THAT

01:57:44.524 --> 01:57:47.026
APPROXIMATELY 60% OF YOUTH ARE

01:57:47.093 --> 01:57:49.529
NEITHER EMPLOYED NOR ENGAGE IN

01:57:49.595 --> 01:57:51.664
AN EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM WHEN THEY

01:57:51.731 --> 01:57:54.834
RETURN TO THEIR COMMUNITIES.

01:57:54.901 --> 01:57:57.637
YOUTH LEAVE DJJ WITH DEEP TRAUMA

01:57:57.703 --> 01:57:59.372
AND INSTITUTIONALIZATION.

01:57:59.439 --> 01:58:01.374
UPON RETURNING HOME MANY USE

01:58:01.441 --> 01:58:03.309
TALK ABOUT THE CHALLENGE OF JUST

01:58:03.376 --> 01:58:04.911
SLEEPING THROUGH THE NIGHT.

01:58:04.977 --> 01:58:06.579
AND HOW IT FELT TO TRY TO SHED

01:58:06.646 --> 01:58:08.181
THE HYPER VIGILANCE THAT THEY

01:58:08.247 --> 01:58:09.449
NEEDED JUST TO SURVIVE IN THE

01:58:09.515 --> 01:58:11.784
FACILITIES.

01:58:11.851 --> 01:58:14.353
AND UNFORTUNATELY OUR DECADES OF

01:58:14.420 --> 01:58:16.722
RESEARCH HAVE FOUND THAT THESE

01:58:16.789 --> 01:58:19.325
CONDITIONS ARE ENDEMIC TO LARGE

01:58:19.392 --> 01:58:22.528
CONGER GET REMOTE INSTITUTIONS

01:58:22.595 --> 01:58:23.963
LIKE DJJ.

01:58:24.030 --> 01:58:25.932
AND NO AMOUNT OF SUPERFICIAL

01:58:25.998 --> 01:58:29.602
REFORM OR FACILITY UPGRADES WILL

01:58:29.669 --> 01:58:31.003
BRING THE CURRENT INSTITUTIONS.

WE RECOMMEND BUDGET ALLOCATIONS

02:02:54.867 --> 02:02:56.235
TO CREATE A COMMISSIONER TASK

02:02:56.302 --> 02:02:58.237

ENFORCEABLE.

02:04:25.758 --> 02:04:27.493
THE STATE DOES NOT PROVIDE

02:07:13.625 --> 02:07:14.960
CALIFORNIA TO STOP RELYING ON

02:07:20.232 --> 02:07:21.233
IF THEY CAN DO THIS BY RE

DIRECTING EXISTING FUNDING

02:07:22.868 --> 02:07:24.436

DESCRIBED ON PAGE.

02:07:26.071 --> 02:07:27.006
SIX THE BUDGET STEPS WOULD

02:07:27.072 --> 02:07:29.074
INCLUDE SENDING BENCHMARKS FOR

02:07:29.141 --> 02:07:29.541

INCARCERATION.

02:07:34.413 --> 02:07:35.547
FINALLY WE RECOMMEND THAT THE

02:07:35.614 --> 02:07:37.383
STATE START THE PROCESS OF RE

02:07:37.449 --> 02:07:39.985
DRAFTING ITS YOUTH JUSTICE COLD.

IT HAS BEEN NEARLY SIXTY YEARS

02:07:41.186 --> 02:07:42.388
SINCE CALIFORNIA LAST OVER ALL

02:07:42.454 --> 02:07:45.424
THE COLD. TO PUT THIS IN CONTEXT

02:07:45.491 --> 02:07:46.492
THE LAWS THAT GOVERN WHAT

02:07:46.558 --> 02:07:47.226
HAPPENED TERM WAS ONE WHAT

02:07:47.292 --> 02:07:48.660
CHILDREN WERE FIRST WRITTEN

02:07:48.727 --> 02:07:50.095
AROUND THE SAME TIME.

02:07:50.162 --> 02:07:51.530
THE LEGISLATIVE OFFICE BUILDING

02:07:51.597 --> 02:07:53.966
WAS ERECTED IF THEY HAD THE TERM

02:07:54.033 --> 02:07:54.533
AT THE BILL IN THIS OLD AND

02:07:54.600 --> 02:07:55.901

02:07:55.968 --> 02:07:57.036
PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE

02:07:57.102 --> 02:07:58.337
NEEDS TO BE LEVELED.

02:07:58.404 --> 02:07:59.638
AND BUILT A NEW.

02:07:59.705 --> 02:08:00.773
THE SAME IS TRUE FOR YOUTH

02:08:00.839 --> 02:08:01.974
JUSTICE LAWS THE LAWS ARE

02:08:02.041 --> 02:08:03.108
WRITTEN WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF

02:08:03.175 --> 02:08:04.810
DECADES OF RESEARCH ON EFFECTIVE

02:08:04.877 --> 02:08:06.178
RESPONSES TO YOUTHFUL MISS

02:08:06.245 --> 02:08:06.845

02:08:06.912 --> 02:08:08.380
AND ADOLESCENT BRAIN DEVELOPMENT

02:08:08.447 --> 02:08:09.615
AND PRINCIPLES OF POSITIVE YOUTH

02:08:09.681 --> 02:08:10.716
JUSTICE.

02:08:10.783 --> 02:08:12.084
MOREOVER THE LAWS WERE WRITTEN

02:08:12.151 --> 02:08:14.453
WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE OF STRUCTURAL

02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:15.621
AND SYSTEMATIC BIAS.

02:08:15.687 --> 02:08:16.555
THAT HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT AND

02:08:16.622 --> 02:08:18.057
DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON YOUTH

02:08:18.123 --> 02:08:19.858
OF COLOR.

02:08:19.925 --> 02:08:21.593
OUR RECOMMENDATION IS THAT.

02:08:21.660 --> 02:08:22.628
AS A FIRST STEP IN THAT

02:08:22.694 --> 02:08:24.396
DIRECTION A NEW PURPOSE CLAUSE

02:08:24.463 --> 02:08:25.697
BE ENACTED FOR THE WEEK COLD.

02:08:25.764 --> 02:08:26.932
KEEP IN MIND THAT THE PURPOSE

I WHILE WE SUPPORT THIS PROPOSED

02:08:34.339 --> 02:08:35.674

ONLY TO STATE FACILITIES AS A

02:08:39.078 --> 02:08:39.511
LITTLE BIT AS ELIZABETH

02:08:39.578 --> 02:08:41.747

02:08:41.814 --> 02:08:43.348
OF YOUTH WHO TOUCH OUR JUSTICE

02:08:43.415 --> 02:08:44.216

WE PROPOSES START WITH THE NEW

02:08:46.018 --> 02:08:46.885

STATE WE HAVE A WE HAVE A

02:08:48.854 --> 02:08:50.355
PROPOSED PURPOSE BECAUSE THIS IS

02:08:50.422 --> 02:08:51.523
GREATER ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.

02:08:51.590 --> 02:08:53.058
THAT HARMS OF JUSTICE SYSTEM

02:08:53.125 --> 02:08:54.927
INVOLVEMENT FALL MOST HEAVILY ON

02:08:54.993 --> 02:08:56.428
YOUTH OF COLOR AND REFORMS.

02:08:56.495 --> 02:08:57.162
MUST.

02:08:57.229 --> 02:08:59.164
PRIORITIZE ANY RACIAL

02:08:59.231 --> 02:09:00.299
DISPARITIES.

02:09:00.365 --> 02:09:01.333
BUT THEIR SELF SO MUCH MORE TO

02:09:01.400 --> 02:09:02.835
DO MY EXPERIENCE AS A MEMBER OF

02:09:02.901 --> 02:09:04.269
THE TARA FIFTEEN WORK GROUP.

02:09:04.336 --> 02:09:05.304
THAT WORKED ON TARA FIFTY

02:09:05.370 --> 02:09:07.239
REVISIONS MADE CLEAR THAT UNTIL

02:09:07.306 --> 02:09:08.607
THE STATE MAKES CONCRETE CHANGES

02:09:08.674 --> 02:09:10.142
IN THE SYSTEM OF OVERSIGHT AND

02:09:10.209 --> 02:09:11.376
ENFORCEMENT.

02:09:11.443 --> 02:09:12.978
OUR EFFORTS WILL BE USELESS MANY

02:09:13.045 --> 02:09:14.546
THOUGHTFUL POWERFUL CHANGES WERE

02:09:14.613 --> 02:09:15.514
MADE TO THE TARA FIFTEEN

02:09:15.581 --> 02:09:18.283
REGULATIONS BUT THE STATE HAS NO

02:09:18.350 --> 02:09:19.751
WAY TO ENFORCE THEM.

02:09:19.818 --> 02:09:20.919
I KNOW VERY WELL HOW IMPORTANT

02:09:20.986 --> 02:09:22.554
THIS IS MY FIRST CONTACT WITH

02:09:24.022 --> 02:09:25.491
GRADE FOR AN ALTERCATION.

02:09:25.557 --> 02:09:26.592
I CONTINUE TO ESCALATE FROM

MY PROBLEM EVER QUESTION NO WAY

02:09:38.203 --> 02:09:39.505

INSTEAD THE SYSTEM BECAME PART

02:09:42.908 --> 02:09:44.076
OF MY HISTORY OF TRAUMA.

02:09:44.143 --> 02:09:45.410
I NEVER EVEN HEARD THE WORD TROM

02:09:45.477 --> 02:09:47.012
OR HAD ANY IDEA WHAT IT MEANT

02:09:47.079 --> 02:09:48.614
UNTIL I WAS OUT AND INVOLVED

02:09:48.680 --> 02:09:49.715
WITH THE COMMUNITY BASED

02:09:49.781 --> 02:09:51.583

LUCAS MORE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE

ANALYST'S OFFICE AND CONSIDERING

02:11:42.661 --> 02:11:43.962
THIS PROPOSAL WE IDENTIFIED A

02:11:44.029 --> 02:11:45.297
FEW KEY QUESTIONS FOR THE

02:11:45.364 --> 02:11:46.932
LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER.

02:11:46.999 --> 02:11:48.600
THE FIRST OF WHICH IS DOES DJ

02:11:48.667 --> 02:11:50.569
NEED TO BE REORGANIZED TO

02:11:50.636 --> 02:11:53.005
IMPROVEREHABILITATION -- WE

02:11:53.071 --> 02:11:53.705
NOTE THAT.

02:11:53.772 --> 02:11:55.240
IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT SPECIFIC

02:11:55.307 --> 02:11:57.476
BARRIERS EXIST TO REHABILITATION

02:11:57.542 --> 02:11:58.910
WITHIN THE CURRENT STRUCTURE.

02:11:58.977 --> 02:12:00.512
AND IN ADDITION IT'S NOT CLEAR

02:12:00.579 --> 02:12:02.047
HOW THE COURT SYSTEM IS

02:12:02.114 --> 02:12:03.949
PERFORMING THE MOST RECENT DATA

02:12:04.016 --> 02:12:05.317
ON RECIDIVISM.

02:12:05.384 --> 02:12:07.319
IS FUN THE COHORT WITH WHO IS

02:12:07.386 --> 02:12:10.889
RELEASED AND 200-011-2000 --

02:12:10.956 --> 02:12:12.624
TWELVE THAT WAS WHILE THE FELLOW

02:12:12.691 --> 02:12:13.258
AUSSIE WAS STILL UNDER

02:12:13.325 --> 02:12:14.593
LITIGATION.

02:12:14.660 --> 02:12:15.627
IT'S NOT CLEAR HOW THE COURT

02:12:15.694 --> 02:12:18.630
SYSTEM AS A PERFORMING NOW THAT

02:12:18.697 --> 02:12:19.197
ADDITIONAL CHANGES HAVE BEEN

02:12:19.264 --> 02:12:20.899
MADE -- AND IN ADDITION WHILE

02:12:20.966 --> 02:12:22.234
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS

02:12:22.301 --> 02:12:23.535
IDENTIFIED SUB WILL BENEFIT

02:12:23.602 --> 02:12:26.038
STONE THIS CONVERSATION -- IT'S

02:12:26.104 --> 02:12:30.475
NOT GO WHAT POTENTIAL

02:12:30.542 --> 02:12:32.077
CONSEQUENCES THIS REORGANIZATION

02:12:32.144 --> 02:12:34.646
COULD HAVE -- FOR INSTANCE IT

02:12:34.713 --> 02:12:35.947
COULD COMPLICATE THE

02:12:36.014 --> 02:12:37.449
COORDINATION OF SO RECESS

02:12:37.516 --> 02:12:41.086
BETWEEN DEPARTMENTS -- AND THEN.

02:12:41.153 --> 02:12:44.556
WE ALSO -- OF WHAT ALL THE

02:12:44.623 --> 02:12:46.191
ALTERNATIVE ORGANIZATIONS ARE

02:12:46.258 --> 02:12:47.626
POSSIBLE TO IMPROVE

02:12:47.693 --> 02:12:49.061
REHABILITATION IF THAT IS

02:12:49.127 --> 02:12:52.230
DESIRED APPROACH TO TAKE -- FOR

02:12:52.297 --> 02:12:54.333
INSTANCE WE COULD POTENTIALLY

02:12:54.399 --> 02:12:55.867
REALIGNED THE JUVENILE JUSTICE

02:12:55.934 --> 02:12:57.502
SYSTEM TO THE COUNTIES OTHER

02:12:57.569 --> 02:12:59.004
THAN HAVING A SEPARATE STATE AND

02:12:59.071 --> 02:13:00.906
COUNTY SYSTEM THIS IS.

02:13:00.972 --> 02:13:01.473
OUR RECOMMENDATION THAT OUR

02:13:01.540 --> 02:13:04.042
OFFICE HAS -- PUT FORWARD IN THE

02:13:04.109 --> 02:13:06.178
PAST -- ANOTHER APPROACH WOULD

02:13:06.244 --> 02:13:07.512
BE TO CONTINUE THE CURRENT

02:13:07.579 --> 02:13:09.047
ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURAL BUT

02:13:09.114 --> 02:13:11.216
MAKE CHANGES WITHIN IT -- OR

02:13:11.283 --> 02:13:12.451
POTENTIALLY INCREASE THIRD PARTY

02:13:12.517 --> 02:13:14.386
OVERSIGHT.

02:13:14.453 --> 02:13:17.089
AND THEN FINALLY -- WE RAISE THE

02:13:17.155 --> 02:13:18.090
QUESTION OF WHETHER THEY SHOULD

02:13:18.156 --> 02:13:19.558
GO THROUGH TRAILER BILL

02:13:19.624 --> 02:13:22.361
LEGISLATION --NOTING THAT THE

02:13:22.427 --> 02:13:23.495
PREVIOUS REALIZATIONS OF THE

02:13:23.562 --> 02:13:24.963
STATE'S JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM

02:13:25.030 --> 02:13:26.898
HAVE GONE THROUGH THE EXECUTIVE

02:13:26.965 --> 02:13:28.367
BRANCH REORGANIZATION PROCESS

02:13:28.433 --> 02:13:30.068
THAT ESTABLISHMENT STATUTE.

02:13:30.135 --> 02:13:32.437
AND IT'S NOT MADE CLEAR WHY THIS

02:13:32.504 --> 02:13:35.073
PARTICULAR PROPOSAL SHOULD GO

02:13:35.140 --> 02:13:35.707
THROUGH TRAILER BILL LEGISLATION

02:13:35.774 --> 02:13:36.942
INSTEAD [inaudible]

02:13:37.008 --> 02:13:38.276
THANK YOU.

02:13:38.343 --> 02:13:39.511

02:13:39.578 --> 02:13:41.813
SYSTEM [inaudible]

STUBBLE LICENSE YOU AGAIN I SEE

THE BOTH OF YOU HERE.

02:13:50.589 --> 02:13:52.257
I THINK FOR THIS DISCUSSION.

02:13:52.324 --> 02:13:54.793
WE NEED TO RE FRAME.

02:13:54.860 --> 02:13:56.595
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN

02:13:56.661 --> 02:13:57.996
MISTER SUPPLE YOU TALKED ABOUT?

02:13:58.063 --> 02:13:59.765
KIDS WHO HURT PEOPLE AND TO

02:13:59.831 --> 02:14:01.933
THEMSELVES OF BEEN HURT LET'S

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:02.567
REFRAME THAT KIDS WHO HAVE BEEN

02:14:02.634 --> 02:14:03.502
HURT.

02:14:03.568 --> 02:14:04.836
BECAUSE IF WE'RE IF THIS IS A

02:14:04.903 --> 02:14:06.037
STEP [inaudible]

02:14:06.104 --> 02:14:07.973
THAT.

02:14:08.039 --> 02:14:09.174
THAT I THINK WE NEED TO BE

02:14:09.241 --> 02:14:10.909
TAKING AND IS WHAT I SAW THIS

02:14:10.976 --> 02:14:12.677
PROPOSED I WAS VERY EXCITED

02:14:12.744 --> 02:14:13.578
ABOUT IT.

02:14:13.645 --> 02:14:16.615
BUT IF ALL WE DO IS REMOVE DJJ

02:14:16.681 --> 02:14:19.217
INTO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

02:14:19.284 --> 02:14:20.819
AND JUST MOVE THIS INCARCERATION

02:14:20.886 --> 02:14:22.187
PEAS AND HEALTH AND HUMAN

02:14:22.254 --> 02:14:23.388
SERVICES.

02:14:23.455 --> 02:14:25.123
I THINK WE'VE MISSED A REAL

02:14:25.190 --> 02:14:26.358
OPPORTUNITY HERE.

02:14:26.425 --> 02:14:29.294
AND THAT IS TO RE.

02:14:29.361 --> 02:14:31.263
HOW WE ADDRESS KIDS AND I'M

02:14:31.329 --> 02:14:32.597
GOING TO CONTINUE TO SAY KIDS AT

02:14:32.664 --> 02:14:34.466
RISK EVEN THOUGH MY GOOD FRIEND

02:14:34.533 --> 02:14:37.469
HERE WILL ALWAYS CHANGE?

02:14:37.536 --> 02:14:39.905
KIDS TOOK TOUGH TALK ABOUT KIDS

02:14:39.971 --> 02:14:41.440
ARE PROMISE.

02:14:41.506 --> 02:14:42.307
I KNOW THAT'S OF THIS CAN BE A

02:14:42.374 --> 02:14:42.841
HARD ONE FOR ME TO ALWAYS

02:14:42.908 --> 02:14:43.241
REMEMBER.

02:14:43.308 --> 02:14:46.378
BECAUSE THESE KIDS ARE KIDS WHO

02:14:46.445 --> 02:14:48.547
HAVE STRUGGLED AND SUFFERED

02:14:48.613 --> 02:14:51.850
THEIR THEIR ORIGINS THERE.

02:14:51.917 --> 02:14:53.652
CHALLENGES ARE NO DIFFERENT THAN

02:14:53.718 --> 02:14:54.886
THOSE KIDS TO GET REMOVED FROM

02:14:54.953 --> 02:14:56.188
THEIR FAMILIES AND THE CHILD

02:14:56.254 --> 02:14:57.589
WELFARE SYSTEM.

02:14:57.656 --> 02:15:00.192
ULTIMATELY SO IF WE RE THINK THE

02:15:00.258 --> 02:15:02.761
SYSTEM THAT'S FOR CHILDREN

02:15:02.828 --> 02:15:04.396
ACROSS THE BOARD.

02:15:04.463 --> 02:15:07.299
THAT HAVE CHALLENGES AND WHO WE

02:15:07.365 --> 02:15:08.800
NEED TO HELP ED WHO DESERVE OUR

02:15:08.867 --> 02:15:10.335
HELP.

02:15:10.402 --> 02:15:11.937
ESSENTIALLY NO WRONG DOOR FOR

02:15:12.003 --> 02:15:13.939
ANY CHILD NOW I THINK WE'RE WE

02:15:14.005 --> 02:15:15.173
HAVE SOMETHING.

02:15:15.240 --> 02:15:17.108
KIDS WHO BUT OF ALL THE JUSTICE

02:15:17.175 --> 02:15:18.710
SYSTEM MAY HAVE.

02:15:18.777 --> 02:15:20.912
AND SOME ISSUES THAT AND THAT

02:15:20.979 --> 02:15:22.047
NEED TO BE DEALT WITH A LITTLE

02:15:22.113 --> 02:15:22.647
BIT DIFFERENTLY THAT AT THAT

02:15:22.714 --> 02:15:24.115
OTHER KIDS DON'T NEED BECAUSE

02:15:24.182 --> 02:15:26.017
THEY'RE NOT INVOLVED IN IN THE

02:15:26.084 --> 02:15:27.752
JUSTICE SYSTEM BUT THAT'S THERE

02:15:27.819 --> 02:15:29.988
SOMETIMES FINE LINES THERE THAT

02:15:30.055 --> 02:15:30.422
THAT.

02:15:30.489 --> 02:15:31.690
WE NEED TO ADDRESS.

02:15:31.756 --> 02:15:33.558
BUT ULTIMATELY ADDRESSING THE

02:15:33.625 --> 02:15:35.227
ISSUES FOR ALL KIDS.

02:15:35.293 --> 02:15:36.761
AND THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR

02:15:36.828 --> 02:15:38.063
COMMUNITIES.

02:15:38.129 --> 02:15:40.131
ULTIMATELY MAKE THE NEED FOR A

02:15:40.198 --> 02:15:43.435
JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM.

02:15:43.502 --> 02:15:44.469
DOWN THE LIGHT.

02:15:44.536 --> 02:15:46.805
HOPEFULLY IDEAL -- THAT'S I

02:15:46.872 --> 02:15:48.440
THINK THE SYSTEM WE CAN STRIVE.

02:15:48.507 --> 02:15:50.375
FOR SO IF WE THINK ABOUT THIS

02:15:50.442 --> 02:15:52.511
AGENCY AS BEING ONE THAT HAS THE

02:15:52.577 --> 02:15:54.746
ABILITY TO COMBINE A NUMBER OF

02:15:54.813 --> 02:15:56.948
THESE COMPONENTS WHERE WE SERVE

02:15:57.015 --> 02:15:57.148
KIDS.

02:15:57.215 --> 02:15:58.717
IN CALIFORNIA.

02:15:58.783 --> 02:15:59.851
WHETHER THEY'RE HOMELESS WHETHER

02:15:59.918 --> 02:16:01.353
THEY'RE JUSTICE INVOLVED WHETHER

02:16:01.419 --> 02:16:03.688
THEY'RE IN THE CHILD WELFARE

02:16:03.755 --> 02:16:04.623
SYSTEM WAR.

02:16:04.689 --> 02:16:06.658
POTENTIALLY IS TO BE REMOVED

02:16:06.725 --> 02:16:08.193
FROM HOMES A NUMBER OF COUNTIES

02:16:08.260 --> 02:16:09.594
HAVE IMPLEMENTED DIFFERENCE

02:16:09.661 --> 02:16:11.263
RESPONSE SYSTEMS WHERE THEY'RE

02:16:11.329 --> 02:16:12.564
GIVING SERVICES TO FAMILIES

02:16:12.631 --> 02:16:14.766
BEFORE THAT CHILD NEEDS TO BE

02:16:14.833 --> 02:16:15.467
REMOVED.

02:16:15.534 --> 02:16:16.501
THOSE CASES ARE ALSO DEALING

02:16:16.568 --> 02:16:17.903
WITH.

02:16:17.969 --> 02:16:19.337
ISSUES IN THOSE FAMILIES THAT

02:16:19.404 --> 02:16:20.906
MIGHT PREVENT A CHILD THEN FROM

02:16:20.972 --> 02:16:22.107
BEING JUSTICE INVOLVED.

02:16:22.173 --> 02:16:23.742
BECAUSE THOSE FAMILIES ARE

02:16:23.808 --> 02:16:25.176
GETTING THE HELP THAT THEY NEED.

02:16:25.243 --> 02:16:26.378
SO WE CAN BRING WELL HEALTH

02:16:26.444 --> 02:16:27.479
COMPONENTS INTO THIS WE CAN

02:16:27.546 --> 02:16:29.781
BRING.

02:16:29.848 --> 02:16:31.349
HEALTH COMPONENTS INTO THIS.

02:16:31.416 --> 02:16:34.252
CULTURAL ISSUES FAMILY ISSUES

02:16:34.319 --> 02:16:36.121
ADVERTISE THAT EXPERIENCES INTO

02:16:36.187 --> 02:16:37.556
A SYSTEM TO ADDRESS A LOT OF

02:16:37.622 --> 02:16:40.792
THOSE THEN WE DON'T NEED.

02:16:40.859 --> 02:16:42.160
WHAT HAS DEVELOPED INTO THIS

02:16:42.227 --> 02:16:44.029
PUNITIVE SYSTEM AND I KNOW WE'RE

02:16:44.095 --> 02:16:45.997
STRUGGLING LOOKING AT THE ENTIRE

02:16:46.064 --> 02:16:47.365
PRISON SYSTEM WHICH IS BUILT ON

02:16:47.432 --> 02:16:48.533
PUNISHMENT RATHER THAN

02:16:48.600 --> 02:16:49.668
REHABILITATION?

02:16:49.734 --> 02:16:51.069
THAT'S WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE SO

02:16:51.136 --> 02:16:52.671
AGAIN IF WE THINK.

02:16:52.737 --> 02:16:55.373
JUST IN THAT NARROW CONTEXT OF

02:16:55.440 --> 02:16:58.043
MOVING DJJ INTO HEALTH AND HUMAN

02:16:58.109 --> 02:16:59.044
SERVICES.

02:16:59.110 --> 02:17:01.146
I WE REALLY MISS SOMETHING IF WE

02:17:01.212 --> 02:17:04.115
RE THANK WHAT THE BROADER SYSTEM

02:17:04.182 --> 02:17:05.750
IS AND THIS IS WHERE.

02:17:05.817 --> 02:17:07.152
I KNOW THE LA -- DEPARTMENT

02:17:07.218 --> 02:17:08.587
FINANCE LOOKING AT PUTTING SOME

02:17:08.653 --> 02:17:09.955
MONEY AND I THINK THIS IS.

02:17:10.021 --> 02:17:11.056
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT THIS

02:17:11.122 --> 02:17:12.824
TRAILER BILL THIS OPPORTUNITY TO

02:17:12.891 --> 02:17:15.026
PUT SOME MONEY INTO THE SYSTEM.

02:17:15.093 --> 02:17:16.795
TO TO REDESIGN HOW ALL OF THOSE

02:17:16.861 --> 02:17:18.597
COMPONENTS WORK TOGETHER WE CAN

02:17:18.663 --> 02:17:20.599
ADDRESS AND COVER A LOT MORE

02:17:20.665 --> 02:17:21.466
GROUND.

02:17:21.533 --> 02:17:23.635
AND THAT IT SHOULD BE DRIVEN BY

02:17:23.702 --> 02:17:25.537
THE JUSTICE SIDE OF THINGS FOR

02:17:25.604 --> 02:17:27.839
KIDS WHO HAVE MADE A MISTAKE BUT

02:17:27.906 --> 02:17:30.208
DRIVEN BY THE THE NEED THAT OUR

02:17:30.275 --> 02:17:30.842
FAMILIES HAVE IN OUR CHILDREN

02:17:30.909 --> 02:17:31.676
HAVE.

02:17:31.743 --> 02:17:33.178
SO THAT THEY DON'T END UP JUST

02:17:33.244 --> 02:17:34.646
AS ABOUT THAT THEY DON'T END UP

02:17:34.713 --> 02:17:36.548
REMOVED FROM THEIR FAMILIES THEY

02:17:36.615 --> 02:17:38.049
DON'T END UP WITH THESE

02:17:38.116 --> 02:17:39.217
ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS IN THE

02:17:39.284 --> 02:17:40.652
SITUATIONS THAT THEY HAVE.

02:17:40.719 --> 02:17:41.720
AND THEN WE CAN DEAL WITH EACH

02:17:41.786 --> 02:17:44.189
KID AS THEIR NEED AS THEY AS

02:17:44.255 --> 02:17:45.023
THEY GO.

02:17:45.090 --> 02:17:46.791
THAT'S TO ME WAS WHAT WAS

02:17:46.858 --> 02:17:48.093
EXCITED ABOUT THE PROPOSAL

02:17:48.159 --> 02:17:49.394
THAT'S THE STEP I THINK WE CAN

02:17:49.461 --> 02:17:50.128
TAKE.

02:17:50.195 --> 02:17:52.297
IF WE DO THAT BUT IF WE IF WE

02:17:52.364 --> 02:17:53.098
ALL WE'RE GONNA DO IS LIMIT

02:17:53.164 --> 02:17:57.736
OURSELVES MOVING DJJ AND HEALTH

02:17:57.802 --> 02:17:59.237
AND HUMAN SERVICES WE MISS THAT.

02:17:59.304 --> 02:17:59.871
SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS THINK

02:17:59.938 --> 02:18:01.373
THIS THROUGH A LITTLE BIT AND

02:18:01.439 --> 02:18:03.141
MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE CEDING.

02:18:03.208 --> 02:18:05.076
THAT WE ARE INVESTING IN A

02:18:05.143 --> 02:18:06.978
SIGNIFICANT SYSTEMS CHANGE WITH

02:18:07.045 --> 02:18:08.747
THE SYSTEM TO CHANGE ISN'T JUST

02:18:08.813 --> 02:18:11.016
DJJ THE SYSTEM TO CHANGE

02:18:11.082 --> 02:18:12.517
SERVICES FOR KIDS.

02:18:12.584 --> 02:18:14.219
AND THEN THERE IS A COMPONENT OF

02:18:14.286 --> 02:18:16.287
IT WHERE WE MAY NEED TO DEAL

02:18:16.354 --> 02:18:18.456
WITH THE REHABILITATIVE AND WITH

02:18:18.523 --> 02:18:20.058
THAT THE THE MISTAKE IT THAT A

02:18:20.125 --> 02:18:21.092
KID HAS MADE.

02:18:21.159 --> 02:18:22.394
SOLVE THAT HELP SOLVE THAT

02:18:22.460 --> 02:18:23.795
PROBLEM FOR THEM AND FOR THAT

02:18:23.862 --> 02:18:25.930
COMMUNITY VENN WHETHER THEY'VE

02:18:25.997 --> 02:18:27.399
BAD REMOVED FROM A FAMILY

02:18:27.465 --> 02:18:28.600
WHETHER THEY'VE BEEN HOMELESS

02:18:28.667 --> 02:18:30.568
WHETHER THEY'VE BAD TRAFFIC.

02:18:30.635 --> 02:18:31.136
WHETHER THEY'VE BEEN JUSTICE

02:18:31.202 --> 02:18:31.903
INVOLVED.

02:18:31.970 --> 02:18:33.605
FIND WAYS TO GET THEM BACK INTO

02:18:33.672 --> 02:18:34.706
THEIR COMMUNITIES IN A

02:18:34.773 --> 02:18:36.508
PRODUCTIVE HEALTHY WAY THAT THAT

02:18:36.574 --> 02:18:38.877
HELPS THEM BREAK THE CYCLES THAT

02:18:38.943 --> 02:18:40.378
HAVE LED THEM TO WHERE THEY ARE.

02:18:40.445 --> 02:18:41.913
SO LET'S.

02:18:41.980 --> 02:18:45.050
AIM HIGH LET'S REALLY LOOK AT

02:18:45.116 --> 02:18:47.952
ALL THE SYSTEMS THAT WE USE TO

02:18:48.019 --> 02:18:50.188
SUPPORT KIDS WHICH I KNOW

02:18:50.255 --> 02:18:50.822
UNFORTUNATE GOES A LITTLE BIT.

02:18:50.889 --> 02:18:52.190
ON THIS COMMITTEE BECAUSE THE

02:18:52.257 --> 02:18:53.491
WAY WE HAVE BROKEN UP.

02:18:53.558 --> 02:18:55.160
BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE THAT'S GOING

02:18:55.226 --> 02:18:56.294
TO BE.

02:18:56.361 --> 02:18:58.329
INTERESTING BUT I THINK WE CAN

02:18:58.396 --> 02:19:00.999
DO THAT AND WITH WITH A WOMAN

02:19:01.066 --> 02:19:02.867
GOVERNOR AND WITH.

02:19:02.934 --> 02:19:04.269
OUTSIDE I KNOW THIS COVER WILL

02:19:04.335 --> 02:19:06.171
TAPE IT EIGHT YEARS AHEAD OF US.

02:19:06.237 --> 02:19:09.674
TO REALLY BE ABLE TO LOOK HARD

02:19:09.741 --> 02:19:10.308
AT THE SYSTEM.

02:19:10.375 --> 02:19:10.942
WE COULD DO SOMETHING EVEN MORE

02:19:11.009 --> 02:19:12.343
AND THAT'S WHAT I HOPE WE CAN

02:19:12.410 --> 02:19:14.412
ULTIMATELY GET TO SO AS WE HAVE

02:19:14.479 --> 02:19:15.580
THE NEXT FEW CONVERSATIONS

02:19:15.647 --> 02:19:16.514
AROUND.

02:19:16.581 --> 02:19:18.416
THIS PROPOSAL THIS SPECIFIC

02:19:18.483 --> 02:19:20.118
BUDGET TRAILER LANGUAGE TO DO

02:19:20.185 --> 02:19:21.319
SOMETHING HERE BUT WORKING

02:19:21.386 --> 02:19:22.654
CLOSELY WITH THE ADMINISTRATION

02:19:22.721 --> 02:19:24.189
WITH YOUR DEPARTMENTS.

02:19:24.255 --> 02:19:26.091
AND THINK A LITTLE BIT MORE

02:19:26.157 --> 02:19:27.325
BROADLY WITH ALL OF THE

02:19:27.392 --> 02:19:28.593
RESOURCES THAT HEALTH AND HUMAN

02:19:28.660 --> 02:19:30.528
SERVICES CAN BRING. TO BEAR

02:19:30.595 --> 02:19:31.563
WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH THE

02:19:31.629 --> 02:19:33.264
MENTAL HEALTH HE'S BRINGING THAT

02:19:33.331 --> 02:19:34.332
INTO THE CONTINUUM OF CARE

02:19:34.399 --> 02:19:36.534
REFORM AND OTHER PIECES THAT.

02:19:36.601 --> 02:19:37.068
THAT NEED TO WORK BETTER

02:19:37.135 --> 02:19:38.169
TOGETHER.

02:19:38.236 --> 02:19:39.571
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ON THE CUSP OF

02:19:39.637 --> 02:19:41.139
THAT'S WHAT SHOULD BE REALLY

02:19:41.206 --> 02:19:43.308
EXCITING AND GIVE US A MUCH

02:19:43.375 --> 02:19:45.376
BETTER OPPORTUNITY TO TO ADDRESS

02:19:45.443 --> 02:19:46.478
ISSUES FOR OUR KIDS AND OUR

02:19:46.544 --> 02:19:47.812
FAMILIES AND OUR COMMUNITY SO

02:19:47.879 --> 02:19:49.047
THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK THAT'S

02:19:49.114 --> 02:19:51.449
WORTHY OF ALL OF US WORKING

02:19:51.516 --> 02:19:53.084
TOGETHER ON MAKING SURE WE GET.

02:19:53.151 --> 02:19:54.619
THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO TABLE GET

02:19:54.686 --> 02:19:57.055
THE RIGHT DECISIONS MADE AND

02:19:57.122 --> 02:19:59.691
KIND OF BREAK DOWN THE THE THE

02:19:59.758 --> 02:20:02.026
SILOS THE BARRIERS TO BEING ABLE

02:20:02.093 --> 02:20:04.429
TO WORK ACROSS DISCIPLINES WHICH

02:20:04.496 --> 02:20:06.097
WE'RE NOT OFFICE AT GOOD DOING

02:20:06.164 --> 02:20:07.866
BUT IF WE CAN DO THAT.

02:20:07.932 --> 02:20:08.867
THEN WE CAN SERVE KIDS MUCH

02:20:08.933 --> 02:20:11.336
BETTER AND I THINK THAT'S THAT

02:20:11.402 --> 02:20:13.872
THAT'S THE THE LIGHT AT THE END

02:20:13.938 --> 02:20:16.207
OF THE TUNNEL FOR ALL OF US A

02:20:16.274 --> 02:20:17.509
REALLY HAPPY TO SEE YOU HERE.

02:20:17.575 --> 02:20:18.843

REALLY START OFFICE CONVERSATION

02:20:20.278 --> 02:20:21.412
BUT WE COULD BE.

02:20:21.479 --> 02:20:23.248
WE COULD BE ON SOMETHING HERE

02:20:23.314 --> 02:20:24.282
THAT REALLY IMPROVES OUR

02:20:24.349 --> 02:20:27.152
COMMUNITIES IN A BIG WAY.

02:20:27.218 --> 02:20:29.454
MRS JONES SAWYER.

02:20:30.688 --> 02:20:34.192
BUT I WAS ALSO VERY EXCITED --

02:20:34.259 --> 02:20:36.327
ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL.

02:20:36.394 --> 02:20:36.861
BECAUSE WE ACT WE CAN'T

02:20:36.928 --> 02:20:39.264
CONTINUES TO SAME THING OVER AND

02:20:39.330 --> 02:20:40.031
OVER AGAIN AND EXPECTING

02:20:40.098 --> 02:20:40.298
DIFFERENT.

02:20:40.365 --> 02:20:41.399

BUT ALSO LIKE TO SEE A VISION.

02:20:45.637 --> 02:20:46.938
NOT JUST MOVED CHAIRS ON THE

02:20:47.005 --> 02:20:48.506
TITANIC.

02:20:48.573 --> 02:20:50.008
THAT WE ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT WE'RE

02:20:50.074 --> 02:20:50.909
DOING.

02:20:50.975 --> 02:20:53.511
AND THAT -- I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR

02:20:53.578 --> 02:20:55.480
THE GOVERNOR'S VISION ON HOW YOU

02:20:55.547 --> 02:20:56.781
WANT.

02:20:56.848 --> 02:20:59.117
THIS TO LOOK ULTIMATELY -- RIGHT

02:20:59.184 --> 02:21:01.085
NOW THEY'RE OUT THERE.

02:21:01.152 --> 02:21:03.988
THE WAY THE SYSTEM IS -- BUT

02:21:04.055 --> 02:21:05.223
BASICALLY TRAINING THE YOUNG

02:21:05.290 --> 02:21:06.991
PEOPLE IN THESE ANY GLADIATOR

02:21:07.058 --> 02:21:08.726
CAMPS BECOME BETTER CRIMINALS

02:21:08.793 --> 02:21:10.128
WILL BECOME BETTER.

02:21:10.195 --> 02:21:11.963
PERSONS TO GO ON TO PRESENTS AND

02:21:12.030 --> 02:21:13.531
BECOME BETTER PRISONERS AND AND

02:21:13.598 --> 02:21:14.732
BE INCARCERATED FOR THE REST OF

02:21:14.799 --> 02:21:16.034
YOUR LIFE.

02:21:16.100 --> 02:21:17.335
AND WE HAVE NOT DONE A VERY GOOD

02:21:17.402 --> 02:21:18.169
JOB.

02:21:18.236 --> 02:21:21.439
IN THE EXISTING SYSTEM RIGHT NOW --

02:21:21.506 --> 02:21:23.107
PART OF THAT IS A CULTURAL THING.

02:21:23.174 --> 02:21:24.375
THAT WHAT YOU'RE ALL IN THAT

02:21:24.442 --> 02:21:26.211
SAME SILO BECAUSE YOU KNOW

02:21:26.277 --> 02:21:27.912

GOVERNMENT WHAT YOU'RE IN THAT

02:21:29.247 --> 02:21:30.415
SILO.

02:21:30.481 --> 02:21:32.083
YOU IS REALLY HARD TO GET OUT OF

02:21:32.150 --> 02:21:33.818
IT IN NEW ALL BECOME KIND OF THE

02:21:33.885 --> 02:21:34.519
SAME [inaudible]

02:21:34.586 --> 02:21:37.455
AND ALMOST LIKE A SCHOOL SYSTEM

02:21:37.522 --> 02:21:38.656
YOU.

02:21:38.723 --> 02:21:40.458
YOU GO FROM ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TO

02:21:40.525 --> 02:21:41.593
THE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL YOU'RE IN

02:21:41.659 --> 02:21:42.594
THE SAME NEIGHBORHOOD TO THE

02:21:42.660 --> 02:21:43.127
HIGH SCHOOL IN THE SAME

02:21:43.194 --> 02:21:44.495
NEIGHBORHOOD.

02:21:44.562 --> 02:21:46.831
AND YOU REALLY NEVER GET OUT OF

02:21:46.898 --> 02:21:48.833
OF WHERE WHAT YOU USED.

02:21:48.900 --> 02:21:51.169
TO AND SO -- I WANT IS I WANT TO

02:21:51.236 --> 02:21:52.937
HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT

02:21:53.004 --> 02:21:53.238
[inaudible]

02:21:53.304 --> 02:21:55.173
WHAT?

02:21:55.240 --> 02:21:56.875
THE DIVISION IS FOR THIS AND IF

THAT INCLUDES HAVING US HERE

02:21:59.577 --> 02:22:01.512
HELP YOU WITH THAT VISION.

02:22:01.579 --> 02:22:03.581
WE SHOULD OTHERWISE I I THINK

02:22:03.648 --> 02:22:07.352
BOTH FINANCE AND AND AND LA --

02:22:07.418 --> 02:22:09.554
URBAN CONSTANTLY BE FRUSTRATED

02:22:09.621 --> 02:22:10.955
ABOUT COME OUT WITH A NUMBER.

02:22:11.022 --> 02:22:12.357
DON'T KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING YOU

02:22:12.423 --> 02:22:13.658
KNOW WE START ORGANIZATIONS WE

02:22:13.725 --> 02:22:15.326
ASK FOR MISSION STATEMENT AND

02:22:15.393 --> 02:22:16.928
ALL OF THAT BUT WE HAVE AN ASK

02:22:16.995 --> 02:22:18.229
FOR MISSION STATEMENT HERE WE

02:22:18.296 --> 02:22:19.631
HAVE ASKED FOR WHAT IS OUR

02:22:19.697 --> 02:22:21.366
ULTIMATE VISION WE HAVE NOBODY'S

02:22:21.432 --> 02:22:22.467
GIVEN US.

02:22:22.533 --> 02:22:24.569
ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT THIS LOOKS

02:22:24.636 --> 02:22:26.304
LIKE WE JUST SAID.

02:22:26.371 --> 02:22:27.505
MOVE CHAIRS OVER HERE.

02:22:27.572 --> 02:22:29.107
AND HOPE FOR A BETTER RESULT --

02:22:29.173 --> 02:22:31.009
I ALSO.

02:22:31.075 --> 02:22:33.211
HAVE BEEN USING.

02:22:33.278 --> 02:22:35.213
THE TERM AT PROMISE.

02:22:35.280 --> 02:22:37.415
BECAUSE AGAIN WE'VE GOT TO LOOK

02:22:37.482 --> 02:22:40.985
AT THE KIDS DIFFERENTLY -- IF WE

02:22:41.052 --> 02:22:43.721
KEEP CALLING -- JUVENILES

02:22:43.788 --> 02:22:45.256
JUVENILE DELINQUENCY CALLING HIM

02:22:45.323 --> 02:22:46.591
AT RISK WE KEEP CALLING NAMES

02:22:46.658 --> 02:22:48.793
LIKE THAT.

02:22:48.860 --> 02:22:49.928
THEN THEY WILL ACT APPROPRIATELY.

02:22:49.994 --> 02:22:51.029
IF YOU TELL THEM THERE'S A

02:22:51.095 --> 02:22:53.031
FUTURE FOR THEM THAT'S A PROMISE

02:22:53.097 --> 02:22:55.033
TO THEM THEY WILL GET BETTER.

02:22:55.099 --> 02:22:57.135
AND WHEN I MEET PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:22:57.201 --> 02:22:58.937
IN DJJ.

02:22:59.003 --> 02:23:01.172

02:23:05.677 --> 02:23:07.278
ABOUT.

02:23:07.345 --> 02:23:10.348
THEIR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO USE --

02:23:10.415 --> 02:23:13.985
PEPPER SPRAY BECAUSE YOU KNOW.

02:23:14.052 --> 02:23:15.887
THOSE KIDS ARE REALLY REALLY BAD.

02:23:15.954 --> 02:23:17.922
AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT WE GO

02:23:17.989 --> 02:23:19.857
THROUGH BUT THERE'S SOMETHING.

02:23:19.924 --> 02:23:22.026
WRONG WHEN THE STAFF

02:23:22.093 --> 02:23:22.327
[inaudible]

02:23:22.393 --> 02:23:24.495
ITSELF.

02:23:24.562 --> 02:23:26.731
IS KIND OF CRIMINALIZING

02:23:26.798 --> 02:23:28.199
CRIMINALIZING THE YOUNG PEOPLE.

02:23:28.266 --> 02:23:30.535
AND SO I I WOULD ALSO TELL YOU

02:23:30.601 --> 02:23:32.036
IF YOU CAN A BILL THAT SHE GOT A

02:23:32.103 --> 02:23:32.603
BILL THAT FROM HER.

02:23:32.670 --> 02:23:34.906
GROUND UP I BELIEVE YOU CAN

02:23:34.973 --> 02:23:36.541
BUILD IT WITH THE EXISTING STAFF

02:23:36.607 --> 02:23:38.343
BUT THOSE THAT DON'T SHARE THE

02:23:38.409 --> 02:23:42.647
VALUES THE VISION -- ABOUT WHO

02:23:42.714 --> 02:23:43.214
YOU MIGHT BE TIME FOR THEM

02:23:43.281 --> 02:23:43.614
RETIRE.

02:23:43.681 --> 02:23:47.452
IT MIGHT BE TIME FOR THEM TO TO

02:23:47.518 --> 02:23:48.686
TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS NEW

02:23:48.753 --> 02:23:50.555
SYSTEM WE'RE BUILDING IS GOING

02:23:50.621 --> 02:23:51.689
IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION.

02:23:51.756 --> 02:23:54.225
BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY

02:23:54.292 --> 02:23:55.626
THE STAFF IS THE ONE THAT WOULD

02:23:55.693 --> 02:23:57.095
FIT IN ONCE IT WILL IMPLEMENT

02:23:57.161 --> 02:23:58.663
THIS.

02:23:58.730 --> 02:24:00.198
IF YOU DON'T HAVE THEM ON BOARD.

02:24:00.264 --> 02:24:01.332
IF YOU DON'T HAVE THEM FULLY

02:24:01.399 --> 02:24:03.668
BEHIND YOU ALL ORDERS ROWING AT

02:24:03.735 --> 02:24:05.236
THE SAME TIME.

02:24:05.303 --> 02:24:06.971
YOU WILL REPLACE THIS WITH THE

02:24:07.038 --> 02:24:09.674
SAME D. J. J. THAT YOU HAVE NOW

02:24:09.741 --> 02:24:11.609
ONLY IT'S IN HEALTH AND HUMAN

02:24:11.676 --> 02:24:12.343
SERVICES.

02:24:12.410 --> 02:24:15.346
YOU JUST MOVED THE CHAIRS WHEN

02:24:15.413 --> 02:24:16.447
YOU DECIDED TO TENT.

02:24:16.514 --> 02:24:18.449
AND SO I WOULD URGE YOU TO SIT

02:24:18.516 --> 02:24:20.852
DOWN WITH THE INDIVIDUALS THAT

02:24:20.918 --> 02:24:22.153
YOU WANT TO WORK IN THESE

02:24:22.220 --> 02:24:23.254
FACILITIES.

02:24:23.321 --> 02:24:25.056
NOW TO GET BY IN THE GET THEIR

02:24:25.123 --> 02:24:26.758
INPUT HOW.

02:24:26.824 --> 02:24:28.626
YOUR YOUR VISION IS.

02:24:28.693 --> 02:24:30.194
SO THAT YOU HAVE THE SOLDIERS

02:24:30.261 --> 02:24:32.697
WITH YOU -- TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

02:24:32.764 --> 02:24:35.633
AND AND THEN FINALLY -- WHAT TWO

02:24:35.700 --> 02:24:37.435
THINGS?

02:24:37.502 --> 02:24:38.836
ONE WORKING WITH THE JUVENILE

02:24:38.903 --> 02:24:39.704
COURTS.

02:24:39.771 --> 02:24:41.139
HOPEFULLY WE HAVE AN

02:24:41.205 --> 02:24:42.640
UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THEY PLAY A

02:24:42.707 --> 02:24:44.642
SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THIS THE

02:24:44.709 --> 02:24:45.943
NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE -- MAKE

02:24:46.010 --> 02:24:47.211
MAYBE COMING YOUR WAY ARE NOT

02:24:47.278 --> 02:24:49.113
COMING YOUR WAY DO WE DO IT IN

02:24:49.180 --> 02:24:51.649
THE TO DO IT AND COMMUNITY.

02:24:51.716 --> 02:24:53.284
DO YOU BRING THEM.

02:24:53.351 --> 02:24:55.053
INTO THIS SETTING OF THE

02:24:55.119 --> 02:24:57.588
JUVENILE COURTS ARE THE THE

02:24:57.655 --> 02:24:58.956
OTHER ONES ARE GOING TO GUIDE A

02:24:59.023 --> 02:25:00.058
LOT OF THIS AND SO WE NEED TO

02:25:00.124 --> 02:25:01.692
HAVE A US A SERIOUS CONVERSATION

02:25:01.759 --> 02:25:02.960
ABOUT THAT AND LOOK AT THE DATA

02:25:03.027 --> 02:25:03.928
WE HAVE.

02:25:03.995 --> 02:25:05.196
AN ULTIMATE OVERSIGHT OF ALL OF

02:25:05.263 --> 02:25:06.531
THAT.

02:25:06.597 --> 02:25:07.665
AND FINALLY THIS WORD CALLED

02:25:07.732 --> 02:25:09.367
FROM.

02:25:09.434 --> 02:25:10.768
TRUMP IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT

02:25:10.835 --> 02:25:13.471
AS I'VE GOT DUPES SEVERAL UP

02:25:13.538 --> 02:25:15.640
PRISONS -- MEETING WITH ADULT

02:25:15.706 --> 02:25:17.575
PRISONERS YOU DON'T KNOW HOW

02:25:17.642 --> 02:25:18.743
MANY OF THEM HAVE TOLD ME.

02:25:18.810 --> 02:25:20.378
SOME REALLY HORRIFIC THINGS THAT

02:25:20.445 --> 02:25:22.447
THEY'VE EXPERIENCE OF CHILDHOOD

02:25:22.513 --> 02:25:23.414
TRAUMA.

02:25:23.481 --> 02:25:25.183
THAT -- I CALL PUSH BACKSTREET

02:25:25.249 --> 02:25:26.918
DISORDER BECAUSE WHAT GOES ON

02:25:26.984 --> 02:25:28.486
THE STREETS SOMETIME MUCH WORSE

02:25:28.553 --> 02:25:30.088
TOMATOES ON IN WAR.

02:25:30.154 --> 02:25:32.824
AND THESE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE

02:25:32.890 --> 02:25:35.259
SPRING SOME THINGS THAT YOU AND

02:25:35.326 --> 02:25:37.128
I IF IT HAPPENED TO US.

02:25:37.195 --> 02:25:39.063
WE HAVE TO SEE SEEK MENTAL

02:25:39.130 --> 02:25:41.099
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS -- TO BE

02:25:41.165 --> 02:25:42.200
ABLE TO GET THROUGH IT AND

02:25:42.266 --> 02:25:43.935
SNEEZE AT LIKE FIVE YEAR OLD

02:25:44.001 --> 02:25:45.703
SECURE -- SEVEN YEAR OLD AND

02:25:45.770 --> 02:25:48.306
THEN WE EXPECT THEM. TO GROW OUT

02:25:48.372 --> 02:25:49.607
OF IT OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME.

02:25:49.674 --> 02:25:53.911
AND SO -- IT MADE ME MORE MONEY

02:25:53.978 --> 02:25:54.212
[inaudible]

02:25:54.278 --> 02:25:55.780
DâN.

02:25:55.847 --> 02:25:57.281
SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES ON THE

02:25:57.348 --> 02:25:58.916
OTHER SIDE.

02:25:58.983 --> 02:26:00.518
OF THE TABLE MAY BE LOOKING AT

02:26:00.585 --> 02:26:02.687
BECAUSE IT'S A WHOLE SYSTEM OF

02:26:02.753 --> 02:26:03.688
CARE.

02:26:03.754 --> 02:26:05.556
THAT WE MAY BE LOOKING AT AND

02:26:05.623 --> 02:26:07.558
NOT JUST -- WHERE CAN WE PUT

02:26:07.625 --> 02:26:08.626
THEM?

02:26:08.693 --> 02:26:10.661
UNTIL THEY GET BETTER.

02:26:10.728 --> 02:26:12.563
NOW WHERE CAN WE PUT THEM SO

02:26:12.630 --> 02:26:14.632
THEY CAN RECEIVE THE SERVICES

02:26:14.699 --> 02:26:16.367
AND A THE HELP THAT THEY NEED TO

02:26:16.434 --> 02:26:17.468
MOVE FORWARD.

02:26:17.535 --> 02:26:20.304
AND AGAIN I I THINK PART OF THE

02:26:20.371 --> 02:26:22.073
THE FUNDING PROBLEM IN THE

02:26:22.140 --> 02:26:24.142
PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE HAVING HERE.

02:26:24.208 --> 02:26:25.776
IS WHAT WE DON'T HAVE THAT

02:26:25.843 --> 02:26:26.410
VISION.

02:26:26.477 --> 02:26:27.612
AND SO.

02:26:27.678 --> 02:26:28.779
THEY LIKE I APOLOGIZE CAME A

02:26:28.846 --> 02:26:31.015
LITTLE LATE MAYBE YOU DID SHARE

02:26:31.082 --> 02:26:33.684
YOUR VISION OF WHAT THIS LOOKS

02:26:33.751 --> 02:26:34.719
LIKE.

02:26:34.785 --> 02:26:35.386
I KNOW SUMMERTIME IS IS REALLY

02:26:35.453 --> 02:26:37.755
MACRO BUT I LIKE TO GET IN TWO

02:26:37.822 --> 02:26:40.291
WEEKS -- OF WHAT.

02:26:40.358 --> 02:26:43.161
TYPE OF A PERSON WILL BE.

02:26:43.227 --> 02:26:44.762
TAKING CARE TO YOUNG PEOPLE WITH

02:26:44.829 --> 02:26:46.230
DIFFERENT TYPE OF PROFESSIONS

02:26:46.297 --> 02:26:48.032
WOULD DEPRIVE SKILL SETS WITH

02:26:48.099 --> 02:26:49.967
THE WHAT DO WE NEED. TO MAKE

02:26:50.034 --> 02:26:50.468
THIS HAPPEN NOT JUST THE

02:26:50.535 --> 02:26:52.069
PHYSICAL.

02:26:52.136 --> 02:26:53.571
BECAUSE I THINK WE CAN BILL LET

02:26:53.638 --> 02:26:57.175
pIMPORTANT THING WHAT GOES ON

02:26:57.241 --> 02:26:57.708
INSIDE.

02:26:57.775 --> 02:26:59.777
SO I AM A I'M I'M HOPING THAT I

02:26:59.844 --> 02:27:01.612
CAN GET.

02:27:01.679 --> 02:27:02.880
OR WITH THIS COMMITTEE AT LEAST

02:27:02.947 --> 02:27:04.649
CAN GET SOME SOME UNDERSTANDING

02:27:04.715 --> 02:27:06.651
OF OF WHERE WE'RE GOING WITH

02:27:06.717 --> 02:27:09.120
THIS SO THAT WHEN WE DO VOTE.

02:27:09.187 --> 02:27:11.455
AND WE DO PUT MONEY TOWARDS THIS

02:27:11.522 --> 02:27:12.757
IS GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION

02:27:12.823 --> 02:27:14.292
WE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE A WHOLE

02:27:14.358 --> 02:27:15.760
OTHER JUST MONTHS LATER

02:27:15.826 --> 02:27:17.028
THANK YOU.

02:27:17.094 --> 02:27:19.063
I WANT TO THANK THOSE WHO CAME

02:27:19.130 --> 02:27:20.765
TODAY THANKS SO THOSE OF YOU WHO

02:27:20.831 --> 02:27:23.134
PARTICIPATE IN THE CONVERSATION --

02:27:23.201 --> 02:27:24.669
I THINK WHEN WE ALL HEARD THAT

02:27:24.735 --> 02:27:26.237
OF THIS RECOMMENDATION AND THE

02:27:26.304 --> 02:27:27.471
EARLY PART OF THE YEAR WE WERE

02:27:27.538 --> 02:27:30.341
CONCERNED THAT THERE WAS NOT --

02:27:30.408 --> 02:27:31.475
THE WE HAD NOT DO NOT HAVE SI A

02:27:31.542 --> 02:27:32.476
PLAN.

02:27:32.543 --> 02:27:33.544
BUT WHAT WE SAW WAS JUST A

02:27:33.611 --> 02:27:35.413
STATEMENT THAT THIS IS GOING TO

02:27:35.479 --> 02:27:37.181
HAPPEN WITHOUT ANY REAL.

02:27:37.248 --> 02:27:38.816
IDEA OF HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE

02:27:38.883 --> 02:27:39.817
WHETHER THEY BE A THOROUGH

02:27:39.884 --> 02:27:42.920
PROCESS ALL THOUGHTFUL PROCESS

02:27:42.987 --> 02:27:45.122
IN DOING THIS AND OF OF WE JUST

02:27:45.189 --> 02:27:46.757
GOT THE RECOMMENDATION LAST

02:27:46.824 --> 02:27:47.358
FRIDAY.

02:27:47.425 --> 02:27:49.026
SO WE HAVEN'T EVEN HAD A CHANCE

02:27:49.093 --> 02:27:50.394
TO REALLY THAT THAT BECAUSE WE

02:27:50.461 --> 02:27:52.296
WERE ON BREAK. FOR THE LAST WEEK

02:27:52.363 --> 02:27:54.232
SO WE'VE HAD NOT HAD A CHANCE TO

02:27:54.298 --> 02:27:55.900
REALLY THOROUGHLY LOOK AT THE

02:27:55.967 --> 02:27:57.368
PROPOSAL WHICH WE WILL DO.

02:27:57.435 --> 02:27:59.003
AND LOOK AT WITH REGARDS TO WHAT

02:27:59.070 --> 02:28:00.371
NEEDS TO HAPPEN.

02:28:00.438 --> 02:28:01.806
MOST OF OUR CONCERNS LEASE MY

02:28:01.872 --> 02:28:04.408
CONCERN INITIALLY WAS AS MANY OF

02:28:04.475 --> 02:28:05.943
THE MEMBERS HAVE SAID ALREADY.

02:28:06.010 --> 02:28:07.411
THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE JUST A

02:28:07.478 --> 02:28:09.213
SIMPLE PLACEMENT OF ONE

02:28:09.280 --> 02:28:11.983
INSTITUTION INTO A OF UNDER THE

02:28:12.049 --> 02:28:14.118
OFF UP UNDER THE CONTROL OF

02:28:14.185 --> 02:28:16.420
ANOTHER INSTITUTION -- THAT NOT

02:28:16.487 --> 02:28:17.955
THAT THAT OF THE INSTITUTION IS

02:28:18.022 --> 02:28:19.523
ALL THAT GREAT YOU KNOW I MEAN

02:28:19.590 --> 02:28:21.125
SO AS A RESULT IT YOU KNOW THE

02:28:21.192 --> 02:28:23.761
IMPLICATION OBVIOUSLY WAS THAT

02:28:23.828 --> 02:28:25.229
THIS SHOULD BE A CHANGE IN.

02:28:25.296 --> 02:28:27.298
PHILOSOPHY OF HOW WE OPERATE AND

02:28:27.365 --> 02:28:28.866
WHAT WE HANDLE AND HOW WE DEAL

02:28:28.933 --> 02:28:30.501
WITH IT IN HOW WE VIEW.

02:28:30.568 --> 02:28:32.403
THE THE ACTIVITIES OF YOUNG

02:28:32.470 --> 02:28:34.572
PEOPLE IN IN CALIFORNIA AND AND

02:28:34.639 --> 02:28:36.407
AND THAT'S AND SEE AN RESULTS I

02:28:36.474 --> 02:28:37.575
A I A PROBLEMS.

02:28:37.642 --> 02:28:40.978
WITH WITH ALL OF THE THE

02:28:41.045 --> 02:28:42.647
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE -- IN

02:28:42.713 --> 02:28:44.448
TERMS OF HOW WE OPERATE PERIOD

02:28:44.515 --> 02:28:46.117
I'D YOU KNOW AND WHEN YOU TELL

02:28:46.183 --> 02:28:47.785
ME THAT IT'S AN ATMOSPHERE OF

02:28:47.852 --> 02:28:49.854
FEAR AND INTIMIDATION AND

02:28:49.920 --> 02:28:52.089
VIOLENCE -- IT'S NOT ONLY IN

02:28:52.156 --> 02:28:53.357
THERE BUT IT'S THROUGHOUT OUR

02:28:53.424 --> 02:28:55.860
OTHER SYSTEMS AS WELL I FIND IT

02:28:55.926 --> 02:28:57.128
APPALLING.

02:28:57.194 --> 02:28:59.664
OF THAT WE TOLERATE THE LEVEL OF

02:28:59.730 --> 02:29:05.436
VIOLENCE IN OUR SYSTEMS AND THAT

02:29:05.503 --> 02:29:07.038
WE BRAG ABOUT IT.

02:29:07.104 --> 02:29:07.872
AND I SAY WHEN I SAY BRAG ABOUT

02:29:07.938 --> 02:29:09.006
IT I MEAN THE SEXUAL ASSAULT --

02:29:09.073 --> 02:29:10.074
ON EACH OTHER THE PHYSICAL

02:29:10.141 --> 02:29:10.675
ASSAULT ON EACH OTHER IN IN

02:29:10.741 --> 02:29:12.443
WITHIN THE INSTITUTIONS YOU KNOW

02:29:12.510 --> 02:29:13.978
SOMEONE GOING ANSWERS ALL YOU'RE

02:29:14.045 --> 02:29:15.179
GOING TO BE SO AND SO'S

02:29:15.246 --> 02:29:16.714
GIRLFRIEND WHEN YOU GET THERE.

02:29:16.781 --> 02:29:18.182
THAT'S A STATEMENT ABOUT SEXUAL

02:29:18.249 --> 02:29:20.318
ASSAULT THAT EVEN IF WE MAKE

02:29:20.384 --> 02:29:21.719
THAT STATEMENT EITHER IN COURT

02:29:21.786 --> 02:29:23.054
OR IN IN IN IN THE POLICE

02:29:23.120 --> 02:29:24.555
DEPARTMENT THIS IS WE TOLERATE

02:29:24.622 --> 02:29:26.290
THIS WE TOLERATE THIS LEVEL OF

02:29:26.357 --> 02:29:27.024
VIOLENCE.

02:29:27.091 --> 02:29:29.694
THAT OCCURS AND IT BOTHERS ME

02:29:29.760 --> 02:29:31.095
BECAUSE THESE ARE HUMAN BEINGS

02:29:31.162 --> 02:29:32.163
AND THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO

02:29:32.229 --> 02:29:33.698
WANT TO REHABILITATE WILL BRING

02:29:33.764 --> 02:29:35.199
THEM BACK INTO SOCIETY THE LAST

02:29:35.266 --> 02:29:36.300
THING YOU WANT TO DO IS TAKE A

02:29:36.367 --> 02:29:37.501
MENTAL PLACE IS GOING TO MAKE

02:29:37.568 --> 02:29:38.769
THEM EVEN MORE VICTIMS.

02:29:38.836 --> 02:29:40.671
MORE DEFENSIVE AND FIGHT MORE SO

02:29:40.738 --> 02:29:41.972
I MEAN SO THIS IS I THINK WE

02:29:42.039 --> 02:29:45.076
HAVE A A WAYS TO GO IN TERMS OF

02:29:45.142 --> 02:29:46.277
THE THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IN

02:29:46.344 --> 02:29:47.478
CALIFORNIA AND IN THIS NATION

02:29:47.545 --> 02:29:49.213
PERIOD IS THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE

02:29:49.280 --> 02:29:49.914
SYSTEM.

02:29:49.980 --> 02:29:51.415
THAT IS BASICALLY PUNITIVE AND

02:29:51.482 --> 02:29:53.184
PEOPLE INTEREST AND BECOME WORSE

02:29:53.250 --> 02:29:54.919
RATHER THAN BETTER AND MOST MOST

02:29:54.985 --> 02:29:56.721
OF THEM UNLESS THEY HAVE A VERY

02:29:56.787 --> 02:29:58.856
STRONG FAMILY THAT INTERVENES

02:29:58.923 --> 02:30:00.391
THE ONES I'VE SEEN HAVE COME OUT.

02:30:00.458 --> 02:30:01.959
A VERY VERY STRONG FAMILIES AND

02:30:02.026 --> 02:30:03.961
OF INTERVENE AND AND AND TRIED

02:30:04.028 --> 02:30:05.096
TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THAT

02:30:05.162 --> 02:30:06.664
PERSON'S LIFE WHICH IS NOT

02:30:06.731 --> 02:30:08.065
ALWAYS THE CASE THAT YOUNG

02:30:08.132 --> 02:30:09.734
PEOPLE HAVE AVAILABLE TO THEM.

02:30:09.800 --> 02:30:11.402
BUT IF IT RELIES UPON THE SYSTEM

02:30:11.469 --> 02:30:13.037
TO REHABILITATE THEM THEN IT

02:30:13.104 --> 02:30:16.974
GENTLY DOESN'T HAPPEN IT DOESN'T

02:30:17.041 --> 02:30:18.476
HAPPEN -- I WAS IN ANY EVENT

02:30:18.542 --> 02:30:21.045
YESTERDAY AND IN LOS ANGELES --

02:30:21.112 --> 02:30:22.847
VISITING WITH FAMILY SAID IN A

02:30:22.913 --> 02:30:24.482
DINNER AND I HAD JUST INQUIRED

02:30:24.548 --> 02:30:26.083
OF SOME YOUNG PEOPLE AND I THINK

02:30:26.150 --> 02:30:27.151
ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE BUT THEY'RE

02:30:27.218 --> 02:30:28.119
MY EAST NOW.

02:30:28.185 --> 02:30:29.587
BUT THE LITTLE BIT YOUNGER AS TO

02:30:29.653 --> 02:30:31.155
WHERE ARE THEY AND THESE ARE

02:30:31.222 --> 02:30:33.424
KIDS WHO HAD -- OF FRIENDS SOME

02:30:33.491 --> 02:30:34.525
FAMILY MEMBERS AND OTHERS WHO

02:30:34.592 --> 02:30:36.427
HAD OFTEN BEEN INVOLVED IN THE

02:30:36.494 --> 02:30:38.496
JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND I

02:30:38.562 --> 02:30:39.630
WANT TO KNOW WHERE THEY WORK.

02:30:39.697 --> 02:30:41.599
WHAT WERE THEY DOING I WASN'T

02:30:41.665 --> 02:30:42.133
THINKING ABOUT COMING ITS

02:30:42.199 --> 02:30:43.834
MEETING I JUST WAS CONCERNED

02:30:43.901 --> 02:30:44.435
BECAUSE I HADN'T SEEN HIM IN

02:30:44.502 --> 02:30:45.136
AWHILE?

02:30:45.202 --> 02:30:47.772
AND NOT A ONE OF THEM WAS DOING

02:30:47.838 --> 02:30:48.239
WELL.

02:30:48.305 --> 02:30:50.341
NOT A ONE OF THOSE WHO WEREN'T

02:30:50.408 --> 02:30:52.810
INCARCERATED WERE IN SEVERE PAIN

02:30:52.877 --> 02:30:54.178
HEALTH ISSUES.

02:30:54.245 --> 02:30:56.514
OF WHERE THEY WERE -- YOU KNOW

02:30:56.580 --> 02:30:57.982
IN THEIR LATE FORTIES EARLY

02:30:58.048 --> 02:30:59.683
FIFTIES AND YET IN WITH AND

02:30:59.750 --> 02:31:00.885
CONVALESCENT HOMES.

02:31:00.951 --> 02:31:02.453
I HAVE WERE VICTIMS OBVIOUSLY A

02:31:02.520 --> 02:31:04.088
CONSTANT SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND AS

02:31:04.155 --> 02:31:05.289
A RESULT IT HAD DESTROYED MUCH

02:31:05.356 --> 02:31:06.991
OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEMS AS WELL AS

02:31:07.057 --> 02:31:08.292
A HOST OF OTHER THINGS.

02:31:08.359 --> 02:31:11.629
SO NOT A PERSON NOT A ONCE IT

02:31:11.695 --> 02:31:13.264
THIS PERSON IS DOING REALLY WELL.

02:31:13.330 --> 02:31:14.632
EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM HAD SOME

02:31:14.698 --> 02:31:15.800
PROBLEMS OF MENTAL HEALTH

02:31:15.866 --> 02:31:17.134
PROBLEMS AND PHYSICAL HEALTH

02:31:17.201 --> 02:31:17.902
PROBLEM.

02:31:17.968 --> 02:31:20.671
AND IT WAS REALLY QUITE SAD THAT

02:31:20.738 --> 02:31:22.339
I REMEMBER THEM AS CHILDREN --

02:31:22.406 --> 02:31:23.908
GETTING INVOLVED IN LITTLE

02:31:23.974 --> 02:31:24.575
ACTIVITIES AND DOING THINGS THAT

02:31:24.642 --> 02:31:27.044
WERE WRONG -- AND NOW AS I LOOK

02:31:27.111 --> 02:31:29.747
AT THEIR LIVES AT THE AFTER

02:31:29.814 --> 02:31:30.481
FORTY FIFTY YEARS.

02:31:30.548 --> 02:31:32.416
AND WHATEVER HAPPENED IN THE

02:31:32.483 --> 02:31:35.019
PROCESS OF ALL THESE ACTIVITIES

02:31:35.085 --> 02:31:36.387
NOTHING TURNED OUT GOOD.

02:31:36.454 --> 02:31:38.789
NOTHING NOT A PERSON SAID TO ME

02:31:38.856 --> 02:31:40.357
ABOUT ANY OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE

02:31:40.424 --> 02:31:41.292
THAT I KNOW.

02:31:41.358 --> 02:31:42.960
OF THERE WAS SOME RELATIVES AND

02:31:43.027 --> 02:31:44.695
SOME FRIENDS THAT THEIR LIVES

02:31:44.762 --> 02:31:46.096
ARE BETTER.

02:31:46.163 --> 02:31:47.131
THAT THEY JUST LIVING A NORMAL

02:31:47.198 --> 02:31:49.567
LIFE EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM WAS

02:31:49.633 --> 02:31:51.702
UNDER THE CARE OF SOMEONE ELSE

02:31:51.769 --> 02:31:53.103
FOR SOME HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH.

02:31:53.170 --> 02:31:55.573
OR MENTAL HEALTH SITUATION AND

02:31:55.639 --> 02:31:56.907
ONE WAS INCARCERATED.

02:31:56.974 --> 02:31:58.642
AND IT WAS ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN

02:31:58.709 --> 02:31:59.977
THAT WE TALKED ABOUT AND I WE

02:32:00.044 --> 02:32:02.847
WAS SO SAD -- TO REMEMBER THESE

02:32:02.913 --> 02:32:04.782
THE THIS THESE YOUNG PEOPLE AND

02:32:04.849 --> 02:32:06.417
TO KNOW THE NOT A ONE HEADED

02:32:06.484 --> 02:32:07.885
GOOD OUTCOME.

02:32:07.952 --> 02:32:09.587
AS A RESULT OF BEING IN THE

02:32:09.653 --> 02:32:11.956
SYSTEMS THEIR WHOLE LIVES AND SO

02:32:12.022 --> 02:32:13.357
IT'S REALLY QUITE SAD FOR ME I

02:32:13.424 --> 02:32:15.159
MEAN I LEFT THAT EVENT JUST

02:32:15.226 --> 02:32:16.894
REALLY DEPRESSED.

02:32:16.961 --> 02:32:17.728
AND IT YET THOUGH A LOT OF OLD

02:32:17.795 --> 02:32:19.396
FOLKS ABOUT WAS DOING EXTREMELY

02:32:19.463 --> 02:32:19.997
WELL.

02:32:20.064 --> 02:32:21.966
BUT THOSE OF THAT I REMEMBER WHO

02:32:22.032 --> 02:32:23.701
WERE VICTIMS OF A WHOLE LOT OF

02:32:23.767 --> 02:32:25.636
DRAMA IN THEIR LIVES -- WITH

02:32:25.703 --> 02:32:27.238
THIS FROM THE FAMILIES OF REAL

02:32:27.304 --> 02:32:29.240
IS WHATEVER IT WAS A SCHOOL OF

02:32:29.306 --> 02:32:30.708
MANY OF THEM WERE COSTLY TAUNTED

02:32:30.774 --> 02:32:32.476
AT SCHOOL AND KICKED OUT ALL THE

02:32:32.543 --> 02:32:33.677
TIME AND NOT UNDERSTOOD THAT

02:32:33.744 --> 02:32:34.812
THEY AT ISSUES.

02:32:34.879 --> 02:32:36.881
NOTHING GOOD CAME FROM THEM NONE

02:32:36.947 --> 02:32:37.448
OF THEM EVER FINISHED HIGH

02:32:37.515 --> 02:32:38.315
SCHOOL.

02:32:38.382 --> 02:32:41.151
AND THEY ALL HAD SEVERE MENTAL

02:32:41.218 --> 02:32:43.020
OR PHYSICAL PROBLEMS AND IT

02:32:43.087 --> 02:32:44.889
BOTHERED ME SO THAT I TOLD MY

02:32:44.955 --> 02:32:46.423
SISTER I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GO

02:32:46.490 --> 02:32:48.259
VISIT THEM WHEN I GO BACK TO LA.

02:32:48.325 --> 02:32:50.027
AND JUST SEE IF IS THIS LATE IN

02:32:50.094 --> 02:32:50.961
LIFE IF I COULD TAKE A LUNCH OR

02:32:51.028 --> 02:32:52.162
DINNER OR SOMETHING I MEAN.

02:32:52.229 --> 02:32:53.631
IT WAS VERY VERY TRAUMATIC FOR

02:32:53.697 --> 02:32:55.399
ME TO UNDERSTAND THAT AND I

02:32:55.466 --> 02:32:57.067
REALIZE THAT THIS IS THE PRODUCT.

02:32:57.134 --> 02:32:58.736
OF THE SYSTEM THAT I THINK

02:32:58.802 --> 02:33:01.038
CLINTON SAID LONG TIME AGO

02:33:01.105 --> 02:33:02.306
SYSTEMS CANNOT RAISE CHILDREN.

02:33:02.373 --> 02:33:03.974
FAMILIES RAISE CHILDREN.

02:33:04.041 --> 02:33:06.043
AND WE SAID THAT WHEN CLINTON

02:33:06.110 --> 02:33:07.545
WAS PRESIDENT AND WE STILL ARE

02:33:07.611 --> 02:33:09.179
TRYING TO LET SYSTEMS RAISE

02:33:09.246 --> 02:33:11.315
CHILDREN OR SOMEONE SAID TO ME

02:33:11.382 --> 02:33:12.616
ONCE WHEN WE WERE TALKING THEY

02:33:12.683 --> 02:33:14.184
SAID ALL THE KIDS ARE WE HAVING

02:33:14.251 --> 02:33:14.985
PROBLEMS WITH.

02:33:15.052 --> 02:33:16.086
OUR WERE ONCE ARE THE

02:33:16.153 --> 02:33:18.055
RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE COUNTIES

02:33:18.122 --> 02:33:19.623
OF OF THE STATE BECAUSE ALL OF

02:33:19.690 --> 02:33:21.559
THEM HAVE SOME KIND OF SOCIAL

02:33:21.625 --> 02:33:23.661
SERVICE AGENCY INVOLVED IN THEIR

02:33:23.727 --> 02:33:24.862
LIVES.

02:33:24.929 --> 02:33:26.063
AND SO IN SO WE HAVE SOME

02:33:26.130 --> 02:33:32.336
RESPONSIBILITY HERE I I WENT TO

02:33:32.403 --> 02:33:33.904
I WAS IN GHANA ONCE FOR PROGRAM

02:33:33.971 --> 02:33:35.873
JUST TO VISIT AND I WHEN I GO I

02:33:35.940 --> 02:33:36.974
KNOW ME TRIED TO SOME GOOD ONE

02:33:37.041 --> 02:33:37.241
ON THERE.

02:33:37.308 --> 02:33:37.775
AND THEN JUST VACATION.

02:33:37.841 --> 02:33:39.243
AND I WENT TO A JUVENILE JUSTICE

02:33:39.310 --> 02:33:40.177
SYSTEM A PROGRAM.

02:33:40.244 --> 02:33:41.312
AND YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW IT

02:33:41.378 --> 02:33:42.413
DRIVING DOWN THE STREET IT WAS

02:33:42.479 --> 02:33:45.015
LIKE A BIG HOUSE SEVERAL HOUSES.

02:33:45.082 --> 02:33:47.084
ON IN THIS BLOCK AND THERE WAS

02:33:47.151 --> 02:33:49.086
NO GATE NOBODY LOCKED UP SO FOR

02:33:49.153 --> 02:33:49.720
THE SOMEONE.

02:33:49.787 --> 02:33:51.155
AND THEY WERE NUMBER OF YOUNG

02:33:51.221 --> 02:33:52.523
LADIES IN THIS IN THIS FACILITY

02:33:52.590 --> 02:33:54.758
AND THEIR PHILOSOPHY WAS THAT

02:33:54.825 --> 02:33:55.859
THESE KIDS HAVE DONE SOMETHING

02:33:55.926 --> 02:33:57.061
WRONG.

02:33:57.127 --> 02:33:59.163
BECAUSE THEIR FAMILIES AND THE

02:33:59.229 --> 02:34:00.497
SOCIETY HAVE FAILED THEM.

02:34:00.564 --> 02:34:02.266
AND SO THEIR TASK WAS TO TRY TO

02:34:02.333 --> 02:34:03.334
RE BILL.

02:34:03.400 --> 02:34:05.336
THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE

02:34:05.402 --> 02:34:06.637
CHILDREN AND THE FAMILIES.

02:34:06.704 --> 02:34:08.505
THEIR ANSWER UNCLES AND COUSINS

02:34:08.572 --> 02:34:10.174
OF WHATEVER AND TO REBUILD THE

02:34:10.240 --> 02:34:11.542
SOME PEOPLE TO THE STRUCTURE OF

02:34:11.609 --> 02:34:12.743
THE FAMILY.

02:34:12.810 --> 02:34:13.944
AND THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE DOING

02:34:14.011 --> 02:34:15.846
OF THE THE KIDS WERE TAKING

02:34:15.913 --> 02:34:17.181
CLASSES THEY WERE LEARNING.

02:34:17.247 --> 02:34:18.415
TO SO WHEN I WENT TO WINS

02:34:18.482 --> 02:34:19.416
WOMEN'S THING THEY WERE LEARNING

02:34:19.483 --> 02:34:21.418
IS A SKILLED IN A TRADE TO SO.

02:34:21.485 --> 02:34:22.653
THEY HAD SOME COUNSELORS THEIR

02:34:22.720 --> 02:34:23.954
THEIR FAMILIES VISITED THEM

02:34:24.021 --> 02:34:25.456
OFTEN.

02:34:25.522 --> 02:34:26.290
YOU KNOW AND THAT WAS COUNSELING

02:34:26.357 --> 02:34:27.925
FOR FAMILIES TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

02:34:27.992 --> 02:34:29.126
IT WHAT IT WHAT WAS THERE

02:34:29.193 --> 02:34:30.894
BECAUSE THEIR PHILOSOPHY WAS.

02:34:30.961 --> 02:34:32.062
IN THIS SOCIETY THE GOOD NAY

02:34:32.129 --> 02:34:34.031
INSISTS THAT IT THAT IS THE

02:34:34.098 --> 02:34:35.599
FAMILY THAT'S THE CENTER.

02:34:35.666 --> 02:34:37.534
OF EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS AND

02:34:37.601 --> 02:34:39.203
AND YOU STRENGTH IN THAT FAMILY

02:34:39.269 --> 02:34:40.504
AND THOSE RELATIVES IN THE

02:34:40.571 --> 02:34:41.972
CONNECTION THAT'S THERE AND THAT

02:34:42.039 --> 02:34:43.607
THE FAMILY HAS A RESPONSIBILITY

02:34:43.674 --> 02:34:44.608
FOR CHILDREN.

02:34:44.675 --> 02:34:45.809
AND WHEN WHEN THINGS GO AWRY

02:34:45.876 --> 02:34:47.511
THEY DO THEIR BEST TO TRY TO

02:34:47.578 --> 02:34:49.179
REBUILD THOSE FAMILIES.

02:34:49.246 --> 02:34:50.247
AND SO I WENT TO A WOMEN'S

02:34:50.314 --> 02:34:52.249
FACILITY AND THEN I WENT TO ONE

02:34:52.316 --> 02:34:53.117
I SHOULDN'T SAY A FACILITY

02:34:53.183 --> 02:34:55.319
BECAUSE REALLY WASN'T AND THEN I

02:34:55.386 --> 02:34:55.919
WENT TO ONE OF WITH THE HEAD

02:34:55.986 --> 02:34:56.320
MALES.

02:34:56.387 --> 02:34:58.455
TOTALLY DIFFERENT VIEW OF HOW

02:34:58.522 --> 02:35:00.090
YOU DEAL WITH WITH YOUNG PEOPLE

02:35:00.157 --> 02:35:01.725
WHO HAVE MADE MISTAKES.

02:35:01.792 --> 02:35:04.261
AND SO I THOUGHT I'D I LEFT THE

02:35:04.328 --> 02:35:06.030
THINK IN WOW YOU KNOW THIS IS A

02:35:06.096 --> 02:35:07.865
WORLD AWAY FROM US YEAH THIS IS

02:35:07.931 --> 02:35:09.066
WOULD BE CONSIDERED A THIRD

02:35:09.133 --> 02:35:10.267
WORLD COUNTRY.

02:35:10.334 --> 02:35:11.902
DEALING WITH ITS OWN CHILDREN

02:35:11.969 --> 02:35:13.203
AND WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO TRY

02:35:13.270 --> 02:35:14.471
TO REBUILD THOSE LIVES FOR THOSE

02:35:14.538 --> 02:35:16.073
YOUNG PEOPLE AND THE FAMILIES

02:35:16.140 --> 02:35:17.474
THAT ARE CENTRAL TO THAT.

02:35:17.541 --> 02:35:19.143
SO WE HAVE GOT I I I AGREE WITH

02:35:19.209 --> 02:35:20.878
MY STAFF WE NEED TO HAVE A

02:35:20.944 --> 02:35:21.612
PHILOSOPHY ABOUT WHAT WE'RE

02:35:21.679 --> 02:35:23.647
GOING TO DO -- I WHAT I AM STILL

02:35:23.714 --> 02:35:24.815
CONCERNED THAT WOULD THERE HAVE

02:35:24.882 --> 02:35:25.816
THERE HAS NOT BEEN ENOUGH

02:35:25.883 --> 02:35:32.823
ONGOING CONVERSATION WITH THE

02:35:32.890 --> 02:35:33.657
LEGISLATURE.

02:35:33.724 --> 02:35:34.825
AND THE VARIOUS ENTITIES AND THE

02:35:34.892 --> 02:35:35.359
FINANCES AS TO WHAT WE'RE

02:35:35.426 --> 02:35:35.993
LOOKING TALKING ABOUT BUILDING

02:35:36.060 --> 02:35:37.227
IT'S ONE THING TO SAY WE'RE

02:35:37.294 --> 02:35:37.661
GOING TO MOVE IT.

02:35:37.728 --> 02:35:38.662
IT'S ANOTHER THING TO TALK ABOUT

02:35:38.729 --> 02:35:39.630
WHERE YOU WILL MOVE IT TO WHERE

02:35:39.697 --> 02:35:40.597
THEY NEED TO BE SOMETHING

02:35:40.664 --> 02:35:41.932
DIFFERENT THAT YOU MOVE IT TO

02:35:41.999 --> 02:35:42.966
WHETHER THIS IS A JOINT

02:35:43.033 --> 02:35:44.334
RESPONSIBILITY.

02:35:44.401 --> 02:35:45.803
OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AT

02:35:45.869 --> 02:35:47.237
SOME POINT A PUBLIC SAFETY

02:35:47.304 --> 02:35:48.572
WHETHER THEY'D RATHER THAN JUST

02:35:48.639 --> 02:35:49.707
SHIFTING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER

02:35:49.773 --> 02:35:50.607
THAN DISCOVERING THAT WOULD

02:35:50.674 --> 02:35:52.309
TOTALLY INADEQUATE BECAUSE WE

02:35:52.376 --> 02:35:53.711
DIDN'T HAVE SOME SERVICES WE HAD

02:35:53.777 --> 02:35:54.011
OVER HERE.

02:35:54.078 --> 02:35:56.447
THAT WE NEED OVER THERE AND SO I

02:35:56.513 --> 02:35:58.382
I I'M HOPING AND AND CONFIDENT

02:35:58.449 --> 02:35:59.783
THAT THERE'S GONNA BE SOME IN

02:35:59.850 --> 02:36:02.119
DEPTH CONVERSATION -- I DON'T

02:36:02.186 --> 02:36:03.520
PLAN DOUBLE FOR A MOVE OF

02:36:03.587 --> 02:36:05.289
ANYTHING THAT IS NOT US SO I

02:36:05.355 --> 02:36:06.290
THINK THAT IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE

02:36:06.356 --> 02:36:07.791
SOME TIME OR US TO TALK ABOUT

02:36:07.858 --> 02:36:08.959
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

02:36:09.026 --> 02:36:10.761
WITH THE ADVOCATES AS WELL AS

02:36:10.828 --> 02:36:12.029
WITH THOSE IN FINANCE I'M MORE

02:36:12.096 --> 02:36:12.963
CONCERNED ABOUT EVER BECAUSE AND

02:36:13.030 --> 02:36:14.665
FINANCE BECAUSE I FIGURED IF WE

02:36:14.732 --> 02:36:16.100
LIKE IT AND WE LOVE IT WILL FUND

02:36:16.166 --> 02:36:17.134
YOU KNOW IT'S ALMOST KIND OF

02:36:17.201 --> 02:36:17.768
THING SO.

02:36:17.835 --> 02:36:19.636
I'M NOT IS IS CONCERNED ABOUT

02:36:19.703 --> 02:36:21.004
THE FINANCIAL PIECE I GUESS YOU

02:36:21.071 --> 02:36:22.206
GUYS WILL TELL US WHAT IT COST

02:36:22.272 --> 02:36:23.373
US AND SO FORTH AND SO ON BIGGER

02:36:23.440 --> 02:36:25.342
BUT BECAUSE MY BELIEF IS THAT IF

02:36:25.409 --> 02:36:26.577
WE DO IT AND WOOD RIGHT.

02:36:26.643 --> 02:36:27.811
EVEN IF IT COSTS US MORE IN THE

02:36:27.878 --> 02:36:32.049
FRONT AND IT WILL COST US LESS

02:36:32.116 --> 02:36:32.382
ON THE BACK.

02:36:32.449 --> 02:36:33.484
AND SO THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY

02:36:33.550 --> 02:36:34.518
IMPORTANT THAT WE DID NOT TRYING

02:36:34.585 --> 02:36:35.719
TO MAKE PERMANENT CRIMINALS AND

02:36:35.786 --> 02:36:36.920
A PERMANENT COST.

02:36:36.987 --> 02:36:38.522
OF THIS THERE'S STILL THAT EVEN

02:36:38.589 --> 02:36:40.190
IF IT'S IF IT'S IF IT COSTS US

02:36:40.257 --> 02:36:42.059
MORE IN THE IN THE BENEFITS THAT

02:36:42.126 --> 02:36:43.827
WE REAP TO HAVING.

02:36:43.894 --> 02:36:46.563
ACTIVE PRODUCTIVE OF RESPONSIBLE

02:36:46.630 --> 02:36:48.098
CITIZENS CONTRIBUTING TO THE

02:36:48.165 --> 02:36:50.734
LIFE OF CALIFORNIA IS FAR BETTER

02:36:50.801 --> 02:36:52.136
THAN HAVING A PIPELINE TO THE

02:36:52.202 --> 02:36:53.637
BIGGEST PRISON THAT WE CAN FIND

02:36:53.704 --> 02:36:55.539
FOR THEM -- IN TERMS OF THE COST

02:36:55.606 --> 02:36:56.740
THAT'S THERE AND SO FORTH AS

02:36:56.807 --> 02:36:58.108
WELL AS A SPENDING A FORTUNE

02:36:58.175 --> 02:36:58.976
RIGHT NOW.

02:36:59.042 --> 02:37:01.378
ON JUVENILE JUSTICE AND AND YOU

02:37:01.445 --> 02:37:02.379
KNOW THE MOUNT PEOPLE TELL ME WE

02:37:02.446 --> 02:37:04.248
SPEND I COULD TAKE A FAMILY

02:37:04.314 --> 02:37:05.849
GIVEN AND MONEY THEY GET A HOUSE.

02:37:05.916 --> 02:37:07.951
AND LIVE GOOD EATEN AND MAYBE

02:37:08.018 --> 02:37:09.153
TAKE EVERYBODY YOU KNOW THAT

02:37:09.219 --> 02:37:10.888
KIND OF STUFF I MEAN REALITY IS

02:37:10.954 --> 02:37:12.289
WHAT WE'VE BEEN A ONE THESE KIDS

02:37:12.356 --> 02:37:13.757
THEIR FAMILIES DON'T MAKE.

02:37:13.824 --> 02:37:16.293
IT AS AS INCOME AND SO THAT IN

02:37:16.360 --> 02:37:19.663
ITSELF IS FRIGHTENING -- TO YEAH

02:37:19.730 --> 02:37:20.764
YOU KNOW THEIR FAMILIES -- MAKE

02:37:20.831 --> 02:37:21.799
TO A FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A

02:37:21.865 --> 02:37:24.201
YEAR AND AND SO AS A RESULT WE

02:37:24.268 --> 02:37:25.302
COULD PROBABLY A WHOLE LOT

02:37:25.369 --> 02:37:27.070
BETTER TO REBUILD FAMILIES AND

02:37:27.137 --> 02:37:29.573
LIVES -- WITH THIS RATHER THAN

02:37:29.640 --> 02:37:30.908
WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING BUT

02:37:30.974 --> 02:37:32.576
BUT I'M OPTIMISTIC I'M GOING TO

02:37:32.643 --> 02:37:33.177
BE THE OPTIMIST IN THE ROOM

02:37:33.243 --> 02:37:33.944
ALWAYS.

02:37:34.011 --> 02:37:35.445
THAT IF WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING

02:37:35.512 --> 02:37:38.081
DO IT RIGHT WELL IT TAKES TIME --

02:37:38.148 --> 02:37:40.050
IT TAKES COMMITMENT WE HAVE A

02:37:40.117 --> 02:37:41.385
LOT OF FOLKS IN LINE WHO GOES

02:37:46.256 --> 02:37:47.925

02:37:47.991 --> 02:37:49.259
HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR A

02:37:49.326 --> 02:37:50.527
LONG TIME.

02:37:50.594 --> 02:37:53.096
SOMETIMES BY THEMSELVES AGAINST

02:37:53.163 --> 02:37:53.864
THE INSTITUTIONS THAT WE'VE

02:37:53.931 --> 02:37:56.366
DEVELOPED -- BUT I THINK WE ARE

02:37:56.433 --> 02:37:58.268
HEADED IN THE GOOD DIRECTION AND

02:37:58.335 --> 02:37:59.837
I THINK AS LONG AS WITH BIT. TO

02:37:59.903 --> 02:38:01.905
MAKING SURE THAT -- THAT WE

02:38:01.972 --> 02:38:03.574

HOW SMART THEY ARE AND AND AND --

02:38:16.453 --> 02:38:18.088

THEY THEY ARE BECAUSE THEY'RE SO

02:38:18.989 --> 02:38:25.395

BUT WE BELIEVE IT IS CRITICAL

02:43:41.378 --> 02:43:42.112

02:54:14.811 --> 02:54:16.212
THOSE WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THIS

02:54:16.279 --> 02:54:17.847
OP PROCESS WILL BE LOOKING AT

02:54:17.914 --> 02:54:19.081
THE PROPOSAL THAT IS COME

02:54:19.148 --> 02:54:21.384
FORWARD THAT WE SEE -- WE'RE NOT

02:54:21.450 --> 02:54:22.852
INTERESTED AS WANTED OUT IN

02:54:22.919 --> 02:54:24.821
COSMETIC CHANGES BUT REAL STRONG

02:54:24.887 --> 02:54:26.989
SYSTEMIC CHANGE THAT WOULD UP

02:54:27.056 --> 02:54:28.391
PRODUCE FOR US -- OF THE

02:54:28.457 --> 02:54:29.525
DIFFERENT RESULTS SO WE THINK

02:54:29.592 --> 02:54:31.127
IT'S IMPORTANT AS WELL AS KIND

02:54:31.194 --> 02:54:34.564
OF SYSTEM THAT SHOULD BE MUCH

02:54:34.630 --> 02:54:36.199
MORE SUPPORTIVE OF YOUNG PEOPLE

02:54:36.265 --> 02:54:37.834
THEN CURRENTLY THE SYSTEM THAT

02:54:37.900 --> 02:54:40.336
WE DO HAVE -- IT IS IMPORTANT

02:54:40.403 --> 02:54:41.504
FOR THOSE WHO ARE ENVISIONING

02:54:41.571 --> 02:54:43.639
AND THINKING OF THIS THAT WOULD

02:54:43.706 --> 02:54:44.974
NOT LOCK OURSELVES INTO BEING

02:54:45.041 --> 02:54:46.409
COMMITTED TO THE CURRENT

02:54:46.475 --> 02:54:47.743
STRUCTURE.

02:54:47.810 --> 02:54:49.312
YOU KNOW I HEAR THIS OFTEN WHERE

02:54:49.378 --> 02:54:50.513
ANY TIME A GOOD WAY TO MAKE

02:54:50.580 --> 02:54:51.747
CHANGE EVERYBODY THINKS

02:54:51.814 --> 02:54:53.149
EVERYBODY WHO'S EMPLOYED.

02:54:53.216 --> 02:54:54.250
IN A SYSTEM HAS TO ALSO MOVE

02:54:54.317 --> 02:54:57.019
WITH THE NEW SYSTEM AND THAT.

02:54:57.086 --> 02:54:58.521
IN THE EFFORT TO TRY TO DO THAT

02:54:58.588 --> 02:55:00.022
YOU LIMIT YOUR VISION.

02:55:00.089 --> 02:55:01.290
AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN PEOPLE WHO

02:55:01.357 --> 02:55:02.391
WORKED IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM

02:55:02.458 --> 02:55:03.793
WILL BE EMPLOYED IN THE CURRENT

02:55:03.860 --> 02:55:05.862
SYSTEM BUT IF IT IF I TASK IS TO

02:55:05.928 --> 02:55:07.263
TAKE ALL THE FOLKS WHO WORK.

02:55:07.330 --> 02:55:08.865
IN A CERTAIN SYSTEM AND PUT THEM

02:55:08.931 --> 02:55:10.566
BACK INTO THE NEW SYSTEM WE WILL

02:55:10.633 --> 02:55:12.068
END UP WITH THE SAME SYSTEM AND

02:55:12.134 --> 02:55:13.169
THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE REAL

02:55:13.236 --> 02:55:14.136
CHALLENGE.

02:55:14.203 --> 02:55:15.738
IS HOW DO WE ENVISION SOMETHING

02:55:15.805 --> 02:55:17.306
WITHOUT NECESSARILY HAVING A

02:55:17.373 --> 02:55:19.108
FACTORY IN THAT ELEMENT KNOWING

02:55:19.175 --> 02:55:20.409
THAT THOSE THINGS WILL WILL WORK

02:55:20.476 --> 02:55:21.911
THEIR WAY OUT AND WILL

02:55:21.978 --> 02:55:23.279
EVENTUALLY COME TO BE BUT IF

02:55:23.346 --> 02:55:25.848
THEY BECOME THE FOUNDATION. FOR

02:55:25.915 --> 02:55:27.083
THE STRUCTURE.

02:55:27.149 --> 02:55:28.684
YOU KNOW IF IF EVERYONE WHO'S

02:55:28.751 --> 02:55:31.187
EMPLOYED CURRENTLY WITH DJJ IS

02:55:31.254 --> 02:55:36.959
THE FOUNDATION OF THE STRUCTURE

02:55:37.026 --> 02:55:37.593
YOU'RE GONNA LIMIT WHAT IT LOOKS

02:55:37.660 --> 02:55:38.461
LIKE.

02:55:38.527 --> 02:55:39.095
BECAUSE THAT'S A DIFFICULT THING

02:55:39.161 --> 02:55:39.328
TO DO.

02:55:39.395 --> 02:55:39.896
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE TRYING TO

02:55:39.962 --> 02:55:40.563
BUILD SOMETHING THAT'S ROUND AND

02:55:40.630 --> 02:55:41.197
YOU'VE GOT A SQUARE PEG IT MAY

02:55:41.264 --> 02:55:41.831
NOT FIT IN.

02:55:41.898 --> 02:55:43.633
YOU KNOW IT JUST MAY NOT AND SO

02:55:43.699 --> 02:55:44.901
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR

02:55:44.967 --> 02:55:47.003
GOALS ARE CLEAR.

02:55:47.069 --> 02:55:48.371
OF WHAT WE WANT TO ACCOMPLISH.

02:55:48.437 --> 02:55:49.605
HAVE THE CREATIVITY IN THE

02:55:49.672 --> 02:55:51.207
VISION AND THE RESOURCES TO MAKE

02:55:51.274 --> 02:55:53.109
THAT HAPPEN AND THEN OBVIOUSLY

02:55:53.175 --> 02:55:54.777
YOU TALK ABOUT PERSONNEL.

02:55:54.844 --> 02:55:56.913
BUT OFTENTIMES IN THIS PLACE WE

02:55:56.979 --> 02:55:58.281
TALK ABOUT PERSONAL FIRST.

02:55:58.347 --> 02:55:59.282
AND THEN WE TALK ABOUT OTHER

02:55:59.348 --> 02:56:00.650
STUFF AND TRY TO MAKE IT WORK

02:56:00.716 --> 02:56:02.785
AND IT NEVER SEEMS TO WORK I RUN

02:56:02.852 --> 02:56:03.386
INTO THIS ALL THE TIME WITH

02:56:03.452 --> 02:56:04.453
SCHOOLS.

02:56:04.520 --> 02:56:06.022
YOU KNOW WHAT WE GOTTA WORK BUT

02:56:06.088 --> 02:56:07.757
MAKE SURE EVERYBODY'S THERE AND

02:56:07.823 --> 02:56:09.158
THEN AS A RESULT THE KIDS DON'T

02:56:09.225 --> 02:56:10.293
GET WHAT THEY NEED.

02:56:10.359 --> 02:56:12.194
SO WE WANT TO BASICALLY RELEASE

02:56:12.261 --> 02:56:13.763
OURSELVES FROM THAT ****.

02:56:13.829 --> 02:56:14.764
AND REALIZE THAT WHAT WE'RE

02:56:14.830 --> 02:56:16.332
LOOKING AT IS CREATING A VISION

02:56:16.399 --> 02:56:18.267
OF WHAT KIND OF SYSTEM SHOULD

02:56:18.334 --> 02:56:19.201
EXIST.

02:56:19.268 --> 02:56:21.237
AND IT AS A RESULT OF THAT HOW

02:56:21.304 --> 02:56:23.339
WHAT IS A PERSONAL NECESSARY TO

02:56:23.406 --> 02:56:24.740
SUPPORT AND DRIVE THAT SYSTEM

02:56:24.807 --> 02:56:26.008
AND I HOPE THAT'S THE VISION

02:56:26.075 --> 02:56:26.642
THAT WOULD GO AWAY.

02:56:26.709 --> 02:56:28.077

ANALYST'S OFFICE WE DO HAVE TWO

03:01:20.469 --> 03:01:21.270
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOU ON THIS

03:01:21.337 --> 03:01:21.937
ISSUE.

03:01:22.004 --> 03:01:24.273
THE FIRST IS THAT THIS PROPOSAL

03:01:24.340 --> 03:01:26.041
REPRESENTS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT

03:01:26.108 --> 03:01:27.676
INCREASE AND ONGOING LEVEL

03:01:27.743 --> 03:01:29.178
FUNDING IS OVER 60%.

03:01:29.245 --> 03:01:30.312
AND TO REALLY IT WE THINK THAT

03:01:30.379 --> 03:01:31.780
THE LEGISLATURE FOR SHOULD FOCUS

03:01:31.847 --> 03:01:33.749
ON ENSURING THAT WHATEVER

03:01:33.816 --> 03:01:35.517
FUNDING IS PROVIDED CONSISTENT

03:01:35.584 --> 03:01:36.819
WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES AND

03:01:36.885 --> 03:01:39.321
IT REFLECTS -- THEIR THOUGHTS.

03:01:39.388 --> 03:01:41.090
THE PLAN THAT'S BEEN LAID OUT

03:01:41.156 --> 03:01:43.325
AND AND DISCUSSED IS ONE WAY.

03:01:43.392 --> 03:01:44.159
OF USING THE DOLLARS IT'S A

03:01:44.226 --> 03:01:46.495
THOUGHTFUL WAY POST REALLY REAL

03:01:46.562 --> 03:01:48.163
VALUE IN THE PROGRAMS ETCETERA.

03:01:48.230 --> 03:01:49.531
BUT THE LEGISLATURE HAS IN PRIOR

03:01:49.598 --> 03:01:51.166
YEARS INDICATED ALTERNATIVE WAYS

03:01:51.233 --> 03:01:52.368
THEY WANTED TO DEDICATE FUNDING

03:01:52.434 --> 03:01:54.503
FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES AND THAT'S

03:01:54.570 --> 03:01:55.838
AN EQUALLY ACCEPTABLE WAY OF

03:01:55.904 --> 03:01:57.172
USING THE DOLLARS.

03:01:57.239 --> 03:01:58.707
SO OUR SECOND RECOMMENDATION IS

03:01:58.774 --> 03:01:59.942
THAT REGARDLESS OF WHATEVER

03:02:00.009 --> 03:02:01.377
FINDINGS PROVIDED WE DO

03:02:01.443 --> 03:02:02.378
RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE

03:02:02.444 --> 03:02:04.079
ADOPTED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE

03:02:04.146 --> 03:02:05.614
REQUIRING ANNUAL REPORTING.

03:02:05.681 --> 03:02:06.649
ON SPECIFIC OUTCOME IN

03:02:06.715 --> 03:02:07.950
PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT ARE

03:02:08.017 --> 03:02:09.218
TIED TO ANY NEW FUNDING THAT'S

03:02:09.285 --> 03:02:10.119
PROVIDED.

03:02:10.185 --> 03:02:11.920
AND SO THIS WILL REALLY HELP THE

03:02:11.987 --> 03:02:13.822
LEGISLATURE MONITOR THAT THE

03:02:13.889 --> 03:02:15.391
