AND NOW ONTO TODAY'S HEARING STATE COORDINATION AND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND UTILITIES CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE CONTROL SYSTEMS. THIS TOPIC IS NOT A NEW ONE AS A COMMITTEE FIRST BEGAN DISCUSSIONS ON CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WITH THE HEARING WHERE WE HEARD FROM BOTH GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY EXPERTS. WITH STORIES OF A SUCCESSFUL ATTACKS ON CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE BECOMING MORE AND MORE FREQUENT AND DESTRUCTIVE ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. AND ESPECIALLY IN CALIFORNIA. THE NEED FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO RECEIVE AN UPDATED ASSESSMENT HAS BECOME APPARENT. MY HOPE IS THAT THIS HEARING WILL PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE WITH A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE RISKS POSED TO OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND UTILITIES. WHAT IS ALREADY BEING DONE TO PROTECT THESE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS AND HOW THE STATE IS- SUPPORTING THESE ENTITIES. CALIFORNIA'S RAPID RECOVERY HE IS PRECARIOUSLY BUILT UPON A VIBRANT AND FUNCTIONING CIVIC INFRASTRUCTURE OF ELECTORS ELECTRICITY GAS AND WATER. THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO BE READY TO FILL GAPS WHERE THEY MAY EXIST PROVIDE SUPPORT. WHERE THERE IS NOT ENOUGH AND REMOVE BARRIERS TO COORDINATION WHERE THEY DO NOT EXIST THE PAELISTS TODAY. ARE FROM ACROSS THE STATE AND AROUND THE COUNTRY TO PROVIDE US WITH THE KNOWLEDGE TO DO JUST THAT. AND I AM VERY EXCITED TO GET RIGHT TO THEIR TESTIMONY. SO FOR OUR FIRST PANEL WE HAVE TO READ THE LANDSCAPE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND UTILITIES. WE HAVE JOINING US TODAY. VERY IMPRESSIVE A GROUP OF FOLKS RANDY ROSE A SENIOR DIRECTOR AT THE CYBER THREAT INTELLIGENCE FROM THE MULTI STATE ISAC WHICH IS THE INFORMATION SHARING AND ANALYSIS CENTER. MANY CANCEL AS SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT NORTH AMERICAN ELECTRIC RELIABILITY CORPORATION AND ALSO WITH THE C. E. O. OF THE ELECTRICITY ISAC. RYAN COBRAR A DISTINGUISHED SECURITY STRATEGIST FROM SPLUNK. AND RON BUSHER THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND GOVERNMENT CTO AT FIRESIDE THANK YOU FOR JOINING US GENTLEMEN WE WILL LISTEN TO YOUR PRAMERICA PREPARED REMARKS AND- AND WE WILL FOLLOW WITH A FEW QUESTIONS IF THERE'S TIME SO WHY DON'T WE START WITH. RANDY. SURE MARYLAND- EVERY THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY- TO THIS HEARING MY NAME IS RANDY ROSE- AND I SERVE AS THE SENIOR DIRECTOR OF CYBER THREAT INTELLIGENCE THE NONPROFIT CENTER FOR INTERNET SECURITY INK OR CIS- I PERSONALLY DIRECTLY SUPPORT THE MULTI STATE ISAC INFORMATION SHARING AND ANALYSIS CENTER THE MS ISAC DIVISION OF CIS WHICH SERVES AS THE FOCAL POINT FOR CYBER THREAT PREVENTION PROTECTION AND RESPONSE FOR THE NATION'S SLT TWO GOVERNMENTS THAT STATE LOCAL TRIBAL AND TERRITORIAL GOVERNMENTS. I SPEND MOST MY CAREER IN THAT- TO THE GOVERNMENT STATE FEDERAL LEVELS AND FIFTY YEARS OF THE DEPARTMENT DEPENDS I HAVE SOME EXPENSIVE EXPERIENCE WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UTILITIES UP TO WORK WITH THE NEW YORK STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE. HELPED DEVELOP THE FIRST CYBER SECURITY. AUDIT AND ASSESSMENT PROGRAM FOR MUNICIPAL OPERATE UTILITIES. I REALLY APPRECIATE THE TIME TO OUT TO SPEAK WITH YOUR TODAY HOW QUICKLY- INTRODUCED BY ORGANIZATIONS YEAH YES AND THEN- TALK ABOUT THE THREATS FACING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND UTILITIES THAT WE SEE. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE AND RESPECTFULLY MAKE FOUR RECOMMENDATIONS. YEAH YES WAS. IN TWO THOUSAND AS A INDEPENDENT NOT FOR PROFIT ORGANIZATION. WITH THE MISSION TO ADVANCE CYBERSECURITY READINESS AND RESPONSE. WE PROVIDE CYBER EXPERTISE IN IN THREE MAIN AREAS THE FIRST IS THE CIS BENCHMARKS. THE BENCHMARKS PROVIDE HIGHLY DETAILED SECURITY SETTING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HARDENED IMAGES ACROSS A LARGE NUMBER. OF COMMERCIAL I. T. PRODUCTS SUCH AS OPERATING SYSTEMS NETWORK DEVICES. THE SECOND IS THAT CRITICAL SECURITY CONTROLS THOSE ARE THE SORT OF INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED EXPERT DEVELOP PRIORITIZE ACTIONS THAT REALLY FORM THE FOUNDATION OF BASIC CYBER HYGIENE AND HELP BUILD DEFENDABLE NETWORKS. THOSE ARE AVAILABLE FOR FREE TO THE PUBLIC AND THEY HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED BY A NUMBER OF THE GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE SECTOR ORGANIZATIONS AROUND THE WORLD INCLUDING CALIFORNIA. AND A TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA'S DATA BREACH REPORT PUBLISHED BY THEN ATTORNEY GENERAL KAMALA HARRIS. WHICH WARNS THAT FAILING TO IMPLEMENT RELEVANT CONTROLS IN CALIFORNIA QUOTE CONSTITUTES A LACK OF REASONABLE SECURITY. THAT REPORT ACTIVELY CONSTITUTES THE WORLD'S FIRST MINIMUM LEVEL OF INFORMATION SECURITY ENTRY CAN BE APPLIED TO CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE TODAY. AND WE ALSO RUN TO ICE AXE THE MULTI STATE ISAC WHICH WE MENTIONED AND MORE RECENTLY THE ELECTIONS INFRASTRUCTURE I SAT. ABOUT THE STATE ISAC IS ACTUALLY THE LARGEST ICE PACK IN THE WORLD WITH MEMBERS ACROSS ALL FIFTY SIX STATES AND TERRITORIES AND MORE THAN ELEVEN THOUSAND OTHER LTT GOVERNMENT ENTITIES IN THE U. S. INCLUDING CITIES COUNTIES. SCHOOLS PUBLIC HOSPITALS. PUBLIC SAFETY ORGANIZATIONS AND. MUNICIPAL RUN IN PUBLIC ON UTILITIES. WE RUN A TWENTY FOUR BY SEVEN TWO OPERATIONS CENTER. AND THAT PROVIDE THE NUMBER OF SERVICES INCLUDING CHARACTER SECURITY MONITORING. AND INCIDENT RESPONSE SUPPORT ALL AT NO COST TO SLT TEAM MEMBERS. AND THEN SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE HAVE ALSO DONE THE SAME FOR ELECTIONS- THE- THE STATE'S I'M SORRY THE COUNTRY ELECTIONS COMMITTEE. AND THAT ORGANIZATION IS NOW IDEA ASPECTS NOT THREE THOUSAND MEMBERS. INCLUDING ALL FIFTY STATES. SO ON THE SCOPE OF CYBER THREATS YOU HAVE TAX ON ON CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE HAD BEEN MUCH LESS COMMON HISTORICALLY. BEEN ATTACKS ON STANDARD BUSINESS NETWORKS IS DIFFICULT WITH THE DATA THAT WE HAVE AT THE END OF SIZE ACTED CONFIDENTLY STATE. THAT THERE IS AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF TARGETED ATTACKS. BUT NONETHELESS A RECENT EXAMPLES HAVE BECOME MAJOR NEWS STORIES TO THEIR WIDESPREAD IMPACT. INTO MOST OBVIOUS EXAMPLES ARE THE COLONIAL PIPELINE IN JBS FOODS NEITHER OF WHICH ARE THOUGHT HE T. RUN BUT THE THIRD SECOND THIRD ORDER EFFECTS OF THOSE. I DID IMPACTOF. STATE LOCAL TRIBAL TERRITORIAL GOVERNMENTS. GOOD NEWS IS THAT YOU. FOR TO OR SOME. ENOUGH TO ADD. IMPACT THE OPERATE TECH ITSELF. THE BAD NEWS IS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO TARGET THAT TECHNOLOGY ITSELF- TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT CAN POTENTIALLY COMPROMISE THE INTEGRITY OF THE INDUSTRIAL ENVIRONMENT. AND THERE ARE CERTAINLY CASES WHERE THE OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IS THE TARGET OF AN ATTACK SUCH AS WHAT HAPPENED IN OLD BALTIMORE FLORIDA. IN FEBRUARY THIS YEAR WHEN THE PACKER TEMPTED TO POISON THE WATER SUPPLY. AND WHILE IT'S CERTAINLY FRIGHTENING AND THEN WE SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. MOST OF THE INSTANCES OF ATTACKS ON CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE NOT THIS WAY FOR. IN BOTH THE COLONIAL PIPELINE IN JBS FOODS ATTACKS. AS WELL AS A TACK ON HONDA IN TWENTY TWENTY. NORSK HYDRO TWENTY NINETEEN THE SYSTEMS AFFECTED WERE NOT CONTROL SYSTEMS BUT STANDARD BUSINESS SYSTEMS ARE SYSTEMS USUALLY BUSINESS OPERATIONS. LIKEWISE ALL THESE ATTACKS WERE CONDUCTED BY CRIMINAL ACTORS. LOOKING FOR A BIG PAYDAY. ALL FOUR OF THOSE ATTACKS INVOLVED RANSOMWARE WHICH IS ARGUABLY THE FASTEST GROWING TRUCK ACROSS ALL SECTORS TODAY AND CERTAINLY WHAT WE SEE THE MOST OF AT THE NSIC. MY CURRENT SELF ESTEEM ALONG WITH DHS'S INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS RECENTLY COMPLETED A JOINT ASSESSMENT IRAN'S MORE TRENDS. BASED ON GLOBAL CONDITIONS AND WHAT WERE THE DATA THAT WE'RE COLLECTING. FOR THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT WE ASSESS THAT RANSOMWARE ATTACKS TARGETING US NETWORKS. ARE LIKELY TO INCREASE IN THE NEAR AND LONG TERM. BECAUSE CYBER CRIMINALS HAVE DEVELOPED EFFECTIVE BUSINESS MODELS. INCREASE THEIR FINANCIAL GAIN. LIKELY HAD PROPER RACIAL SUCCESS. AND ANONYMITY. ANOTHER NUMBER OF FACTORS AT PLAY IN HERE. ACCORDING LARGELY UNREGULATED CRYPTOCURRENCY MARKET AND ESPECIALLY THE WILLINGNESS OF VICTIMS TO PAY RANSOMS. DESPITE SOME GROUPS CLAIMING THEY WILL NOT TARGET CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE NETWORKS CONTINUE TO BE ATTRACTIVE TARGETS WE SHOULD BE OF GREAT CONCERN TO THOSE DEFENDING SLT P. OWNED AND OPERATED CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. FOR A FEW REASONS THE FIRST. IS THAT YOUR AIR GAPPING A CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IS NO LONGER PRACTICAL. FOR A SECOND THAT RANSOMWARE ON THESE NETWORKS WILL DENY ACCESS TO SYSTEMS THAT COULD BE ESSENTIAL AND MONITORING ADMINISTERING AND CONTROLLING. OR AT LEAST TRANSLATING BETWEEN STANDARD TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY. CRITICALITY THE SYSTEM'S PUTS PRESSURE ON CHECK DOWNS TO PAY THE RANSOM GENDER PAY THEM QUICKLY AND DUE TO THE EVOLUTION OF THE RANSOMWARE BUSINESS MODEL. HANG AROUND SOME DOES NOT NECESSARILY CONSTITUTE APRIL DEPARTURE OF CRIMINAL ACTORS FROM THE VICTIM ENVIRONMENT WITH REGARD TO CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURES SPECIFICALLY IN RANSOMWARE WE EXPECT TO SEE MORE TARGETING OF THE TOP CRITICAL NETWORKS AND OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY AS A GOAL BECAUSE THE GOAL OF THESE ACTORS IS A QUICK PAYDAY. IF YOU ORGANIZATIONS HAVE THE UPTIME REQUIREMENTS. FOR THOSE WHO OPERATE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. WE'RE THINKING BEYOND RANSOMWARE THERE ARE NATION STATE ACTORS AND OTHER CRIMINAL ACTORS WHO HAVE SPECIFIC INTERESTING CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. IN OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS THAT CAN INCLUDE ESPIONAGE DESTRUCTION. AWAY AND EVEN INFLUENCE OPERATIONS. BUT NO MATTER THE REASON IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO RECOGNIZE THAT MALICIOUS CYBER ACTORS WILL INCREASINGLY TARGET NETWORKS THAT. ARE SPECIFIC INTEREST TO US GOVERNMENT ENTITIES AT THE FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL ESPECIALLY THOSE NETWORKS DEEMED AS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT ALLOWS ME TO GAIN AN ECONOMIC OR FINANCIAL POLITICAL SOCIAL OR EVEN MILITARY ADVANTAGE. BECAUSE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET OR RELIANT UPON INTERNET CONNECTED DEVICES- WE SHOULD EXPECT TO SEE AN INCREASE IN SUCCESSFUL TAX AND WITH THAT. I WOULD LIKE TO RECOMMEND FOR- GET RIGHT FOR RECORD. IMPORTANT TO YOUR LIFE AND I SUBSTATIONS RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE STATE THAT NEARLY A QUARTER OF ALL NON DEFENSE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE U. S. IS OWNED AND OPERATED BY SLT PIECE. SO THERE'S WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE HERE AND THE FOLLOWING RECOMMENDATIONS ARE DESIGNED TO BE IMPLEMENTED. WITH NO ADDITIONAL COSTS USING THE PEOPLE CAPABILITIES ALREADY AVAILABLE. THE FIRST IS FOR CALIFORNIA TO RECOMMEND THAT ALL S. O. T. T. IS WITHIN THE STATE. R. L. A. SHE TO LD HE'S IN THE STATE- ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT OWN AND OPERATE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE JOINING MS ISAC. IT'S NO COST. MEMBERSHIP IS ENTIRELY FREE AND MEMBERS GAIN ACCESS TO A PLETHORA OF BENEFITS INCLUDING THAT AROUND THE CLOCK MONITORING SERVICE I MENTIONED. GEORGIANS ARE SPONSOR PORT. AND A NUMBER. OF PREVENTIVE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE. BUT SEE I HAVE CONTROL IN ALL. OF THAT WORKS. BUYER TO CRITICAL NEED FOR. OUR ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT AND THE CAN. HELLO WITH NO OTHER ACTIONS MITIGATES APPROXIMATELY 83% OF ALL TARGETED. ATTACK TECHNIQUES FOUND IN INDUSTRY STANDARD MITRE ATTACK FRAMEWORK. THE THIRD IS TO DEPLOY HARDENED IMAGES SUCH AS THE SEA ICE BENCHMARKS ALTHOUGH THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS AND ALL APPLICABLE SYSTEMS THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT IMPLEMENTING BENCHMARK SYSTEMS ARE HARDENED SYSTEMS ENSURES THAT SECURITY IS BAKED INTO THE DEPLOYMENT OF THOSE SYSTEMS. AND NOT TACKED ON AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT. AND FINALLY WE RECOMMEND THE SLT TEAMS CONDUCT REGULAR AUDITS OF OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY CAN CONTROL SYSTEMS. TO ENSURE THAT CONTROLS THAT ARE PUT IN PLACE ARE NOT BEING BY PASSED. AND THAT SYSTEM USAGE IS IN LINE WITH EXPECTATIONS. SHARES FROM EXISTING STATE LOCAL AGENCIES CAN BE TRAINED IN WHAT NORMAL LOOKS LIKE ON THE SYSTEMS. AND THEY CAN QUICKLY FIND DEVIATIONS FROM THE NORM. WITH US FOR RECOMMENDATIONS I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY FOR LYING YEAH YES THEY OPPORTUNITY TO TEST BY TODAY. AFTER CONSIDERING OUR RECOMMENDATIONS WERE SECURING CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR ROSE AND NEXT WE HAVE- MANDY COUNCIL UP. MORNING EVERYBODY AND- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO- TO TESTIFY THIS MORNING ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT SUPPORT THE TOPIC AND ARE SIMILAR TO MR ROSE WILL GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON THE ICE BACKGROUND CHECKS OUT WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR. AND ALSO PROVIDE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS AS WELL- SO FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT MAY NOT BE FAMILIAR WITH THE E. ISAC- THE ELECTRICITY INFORMATION SHARING AND ANALYSIS CENTER- IT WAS ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE- WE ARE ESSENTIALLY AN INFORMATION CLEARINGHOUSE SECURITY CLEARINGHOUSE FOR- CORRECT INFORMATION. AND INTELLIGENCE TO THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR ALL ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA- WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY TWELVE HUNDRED DONE ALMOST THIRTEEN HUNDRED MEMBERS THAT ARE PART OF THE I. SHAC. AND THAT REPRESENTS ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE AND CUSTOMERS IN THE UNITED STATES HERE. ALL YOU. REALLY ARE FOCUSED ON BEING A CLEARING HOUSE YOU KNOW SO WHILE WE ARE FOCUSED ON PROVIDING TIMELY AND ACTIONABLE INFORMATION TO THE SECTOR SO WE CAN MAINTAIN SITUATIONAL AWARENESS- WE ALSO PROVIDE CURATED ANALYSIS ON BOTH PHYSICAL AND CYBER SECURITY THREATS- AND WORK WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS AS WELL. I'M TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING VALUE IN THOSE AREAS. THE OTHER THING THAT WE DO IS WE ACT AS A CONDUIT TO THE FEDERAL pSPECIFIC AGENCY THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY. BUT ALSO WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND OTHER ON A CRITICAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES TO HELP ADVANCE THEIR PROGRAMS- ELECTRICITY SECTOR AS WELL. AND SO THAT IS A BIG PART OF WHAT WE DO. ALL WE ARE HEADQUARTERED IN WASHINGTON DC WE HAVE RESOURCES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES THAT. PROVIDE OUR SERVICES AND SIMILAR TO THE OTHER SIDE SACK AND I SHOULD SAY WE ACTUALLY WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE MS ISACAND- VERY HAPPY- WITH THE RELATIONSHIP A COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIP THAT WE HAVE WITH THEM- WE OPERATED TWENTY FOUR BY SEVEN SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER- THAT. PUSHES. OUT INFORMATION ON A DAILY BASIS. SO I'LL- TO WHAT WERE SEEING A THE STAR AND LIKE- ALL CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURES. SECTORS AND IS MISTER ROSE POINTED OUT- THIS IS CLEARLY AN UNPRECEDENTED PERIOD YOU KNOW THE VOLUME VELOCITY AND COMPLEXITY. OF THE THREAT THAT WE'RE SEEING ARE UNPRECEDENTED- AND IF YOU YOU KNOW GO BACK TO SOME SOURCES SO THE- THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE- WORLDWIDE THREAT ASSESSMENT. AGAIN HAS CONFIRMED. AND STATED THAT OUR SOPHISTICATED NATION STATE ADVERSARIES ABSOLUTELY HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO DISRUPT CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. ALSO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO MONITOR FOR AND ALSO THAT ORGANIZED CRIME WILL CONTINUE TO TRY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US RIGHT AND DISRUPT. BOB PUT THEIR OWN MONETARY GAINS- AND- ACTUALLY THESE TAXES WHILE- AND TO THE POINT OF- VELOCITY AND VOLUME. YOU KNOW MICROSOFT IN THEIR ANNUAL- THREAT- BOULDER ABILITY REPORT. CITED A 48% INCREASE IN VULNERABILITIES FROM TWENTY NINETEEN. TO TWENTY TWENTY- SO THAT IS A STEP CHANGE IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT OF- BALL THE BILL THESE THAT COMPANIES NEED TO DEAL WITH- AND WHETHER IT'S UTILITY OR ANY OTHER CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTOR- BUT IT'S- YOU KNOW. THAT ALSO GET SAMPLE FIVE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT OTHER SOFTWARE PROVIDERS AND OTHER- QUICKENING PROVIDERS RIGHT AND SO CLEARLY THE NUMBER AND THE PACEOF THE VULNERABILITIES- REALLY IS WE ARE CONTINUING TO THE CLIPS YOU KNOW ANY PRIOR- PATTERNS THAT WE'VE HAD BEFORE- CERTAINLY WE SEEN ENOUGH. INCREASE IN RATES. AND SORTS USE THIS IN THE TO- SO THE ATTACK ON CALL- AS WE AS J. ASPECT THERE ARE BEEN RAN. ATTACKS IN THE SECTOR IS- AGAIN SO WITH END WE ARE ABSOLUTE SENIOR INCREASE- IN IN THAT ACTIVITY. I'M GOING FORWARD THE SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS YOU KNOW STARTING WITH THE SOLE WINDSOR COMPROMISE IN DECEMBER- AND THEN CONTINUING TO OTHER YOU KNOW ENTERPRISE CLASS SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS SUCH AS THE MICROSOFT EXCHANGE SERVER TAX. HEALTH CONNECTS WITH YOUR AND EVEN MORE RECENTLY LAST WEEK TO SAY- BSA ATTACKED- ALL DEMONSTRATE THE SOPHISTICATION THAT OUR ADVERSARIES HAVE THEY ARE PERSISTENT. THEY ARE- HIGHLY COMPETENT AND TECHNICAL NAY OUR PATIENTS THEIR WILLING TO WAIT AND YOU KNOW- CONDUCT IN OUR SYSTEM DO SURVEILLANCE. AND LEARN WHAT THEY CAN LEARN AND YOU KNOW TRAVERSE LATERALLY ACROSS NETWORKS. FOR THEIR GAIN AND WHETHER IT'S FOR- SURVEILLANCE ESPIONAGE. WHAT MAY BE THE DISRUPTOR IS GOING TO STRUCTURE IT AGAIN UNDERSCORES THE NEED TO REMAIN. VIGILANT ON THIS- SO AGAIN YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO YOU KNOW MAKE SURE THE SECT AWAY- THE STATE- WE PUSH OUT INDICATOR OF COMP- WE SHARE INFORMATION REGARDING THE IMPACT HOW TO ASSESS THE IMPACT AND ALSO HELP MITIGATE- THE STRETCHES WE GO FORWARD. DONALD GUARDING- THE- THE QUESTION OF SEGMENTATION WHICH IS YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU PROTECT THESE ENVIRONMENTS PARTICULARLY OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY ENVIRONMENTS- YOU KNOW WE STILL BELIEVE THAT NETWORKS SHOULD BE SEGMENTED STILL OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY NETWORKS SHOULD BE SEGMENTED FROM CORPORATE NETWORKS. BUT MR ROSE POINTED OUT THAT IS NOT THE ONLY CONTROL AND AGAIN THEY HAVE TO BE ON THE CONTROLS IN PLACE- TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE NETWORKS ARE NOT COMPROMISED AND SO THAT INCLUDES BASIC CYBER HYGIENE YOU KNOW- THINGS LIKE. STRONG PASSWORD POLICIES THE USE OF MULTI FACTOR AUTHENTICATION AS YOU TRAVERSE ACROSS NETWORKS- IMPLEMENTATION OF- TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS- USER BEHAVIOR ANALYTICS AS WELL AS ENDPOINT DETECTION AND PROTECTION AND DETECTION ENDPOINT DETECTION PROTECTION EXCUSE ME TECHNOLOGIES THAT REALLY HELP YOU TO NOW- IF SOMETHING ELSE IS GOING ON IN YOUR NETWORK. YOU KNOW ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY THAT WE TRY TO REINFORCE IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT ATTACHED LIKE SO WHEN AND ALSO THE REASON TO SAY ATTACK TOOK ADVANTAGE JOB WAS ADMINISTRATIVE PRIVILEGES IN NETWORK AND AGAIN ENTERPRISE CLASS TOOLS LIKE THAT REQUIRED THOSE PRIVILEGES. BUT IT ALSO PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT HOW WE IMPLEMENT THOSE TECHNOLOGIES GOING FORWARD AND IDEALLY REDUCE THE- THE NUMBER OF- IN THE MINISTRY OF PRIVILEGE ACCOUNTS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR ENVIRONMENTS YOUR. ADVERSARIES CAN'T TAKE- VANTAGE OF THE- I. THE OTHER THING IS TO YOU KNOW WHEN- MISTER ROWE BELIEVE TO THIS IS WELL AS THE CONTINUE TO BE PREPARED TO DRILL- YOU KNOW WHAT AN ATTACK IN RESPONSE LOOKS LIKE ARE YOU DON'T WANT TO FIGURE OUT- HOW TO RESPOND TO A RANSOMWARE ATTACK WHEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY EXPERIENCING IT SO THINKING ABOUT HOW YOU WOULD GO ABOUT- DEALING WITH AN ATTACK MAKING SURE THAT YOU KNOW WHO TO NOTIFY INCLUDING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND REGULATORY. COMMISSIONS- AS WELL AS- THINKING ABOUT WILL YOU PAY THE RANSOM WHAT CONDITIONS WOULD MAKE YOU THINK ABOUT PAYING THE RANSOM AND AGAIN WE'RE NOT ADVOCATE THAT PAYING THE RANSOM BUT THE REALITY IS THAT YOU KNOW YOU MAY NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT. AND ALSO IF YOU NEED TO GET AN ACQUIRER CRYPTO CURRENCY- AGAIN YOU DON'T ACTUALLY WANT TO HAVE TO DO THAT WHILE YOU'RE DOING BECAUSE- YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A- SITUATION LIKE THAT- LAST WEEK PREPARING TO RECOVER YOU KNOW SO MAKING SURE THAT YOU CAN PREPARE FROM BACKUPS- DRILLING THAT. AND MAKING SURE THAT YOUR CRITICAL SYSTEMS THAT COULD AFFECT YOUR OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS ARE UP AND RUNNING AS WELL- ASSEMBLY TO MISTER ROSE YOU KNOW- IN TERMS OF RECOMMENDATIONS- WE WOULD STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO JOIN THE- WE ARE SHOCKED- IF YOU HAVEN'T. IT IS LSO FREE- AND AGAIN IT HELPS OF THE SECTOR AS WELL AS OTHER CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS MAINTAIN. OUR SITUATIONAL AWARENESS- YOU KNOW WE ARE SUPPORTER OF THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL- INCLUDING BE- BY DIDN'T MINISTRATIONS RECENT HUNDRED DAY PLAN. WHICH THE I. TECH IS ACTIVELY INVOLVED AND THIS IS REALLY TALKS TO THE DEPLOYMENT OF SENSOR TECHNOLOGIES. IN OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY NETWORKS SO WE CAN HAVE INCREASED VISIBILITY. INTO THOSE NETWORKS- AND THEN DO A BETTER JOB OF THINKING ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO TO FURTHER MITIGATE OR PROTECT AGAINST THESE RAPS. ON SELECT INCLUDES. MY- INITIAL TESTIMONY. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MAY. AT COUNCIL AND- WE HAVE RYAN KHOBAR NEXT. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TODAY TO APPEAR BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE DISCUSSED CYBER SECURITY AND RISK TO CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SUCH AS UTILITIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. I THERE'S A LOT OF MATERIAL TO COVER AND MANY MY PREVIOUS SPEAKERS VERY HIT ON MAY THE HIGH NOTES WHICH I MOSTLY AGREE WITH SOMEONE TO TRY TO KEEP THIS SHORT AND SWEET. MY NAME IS FRANCO BARNETT SERVICES THING WITH CYBERSECURITY STRATEGIST OF SPOCK GLOBAL SOFTWARE COMPANY BASED IN SAN FRANCISCO I HAVE OVER TWENTY YEARS OF CYBERSECURITY EXPERIENCE ACROSS BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS GLOBALLY. THANK AS A TRUSTED. TO MORE THAN NINETY OF THE FORTUNE ONE HUNDRED AND WE ARE PROUD TO COUNT MANY LEADING GOVERNMENTS AND EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND NONPROFITS AS CUSTOMERS. SUBQUERY THREATS ARE GROWING BOTH THE NUMBER AND COMPLEXITY HIGH PROFILE ATTACKS SUCH AS COLONIAL PIPELINE SOLAR WINDS AND ATTACKS ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SUCH AS ATLANTA AND BALTIMORE. JOIN THE GROWING LIST IN FRONT PAGE START SECURITY COMPROMISES TO OR NOT TIONAL IN CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. A COMBINATION OF ACCELERATING TECHNOLOGY TRENDS HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED CYBERSECURITY TAX SERVICES TO ORGANIZATIONS CYBERSECURITY TEAMS ARE TASKED WITH DEFENDING. THE CYBER INCIDENTS WE SEE TODAY RANGE FROM BASIC CONFIDENCE GAMES TO MASSIVE DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACKS TO SOPHISTICATED INTRUSIONS IN THE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS THE IMPACT CAN BE A MEDIA SUCH AS A THEFT OF MONEY DISRUPTION OR CRITICAL SERVICES WORK MORE LONG TERM IT CAN RUIN AN ORGANIZATION'S REPUTATION AND FINANCES YOU CAN IMPACT CITIZENS TRUST IN THEIR GOVERNMENT'S ABILITY TO GIVE OUT THOSE INDUSTRIES AND UTILITIES. IN SOME CASES CYBER ATTACKS EVEN CAUSE PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO OUR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS JEOPARDIZING SAFETY AND SECURITY OF OUR CITIZENS. ATTACKER FROM THE GAMUT OF HIGHLY ORGANIZED CRIMINAL ENTERPRISES TO DISGRUNTLED EMPLOYEES FROM SO CALLED HACKTIVISTS TO WELL RESOURCE STATE SPONSORED GROUPS. THE MOTIVATION CAN VARY FROM PURELY FINANCIAL GAME TO POLITICAL CAUSES TO EVEN ASK YOU NOT. ITALY'S THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BASIS INSIDER THREATS BUT THE LARGEST PRIVATE SECTOR TO SECTOR COMPANIES IN THE WORLD ARE FACING BUT WITH LIMITED RESOURCES TO DEFEND THEMSELVES. THEY'RE NOT CURRENTLY PREPARED TO DEAL WITH THE ATTACKS BY RANSOMWARE CRIMINAL GANGS ARE TARGETING THEIR ORGANIZATIONS FOR QUICK FINANCIAL PAYOUTS. NOR ARE THEY READY TO DEFEND AGAINST THE GROWING TREND OF STATE SPONSORED ADVERSARIES WHO UTILITIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS LEGITIMATE POLITICAL TARGETS. A RECENT REPORT FROM THE STARSKY FROM DRACO SAID LICENSES SPECIALIZES IN ICS DATA SHOWS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CYBERATTACKS OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. SOME COULD ARGUE THAT THIS IS ONLY BECAUSE WE ARE NOW LOOKING FOR THEIR THREATS BUT I WOULD DISAGREE. I THINK THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY MORE INTEREST IN ATTACKING THE FABRIC OF OUR NATION BOTH FROM CYBER WARFARE OR POLITICAL EMBARRASSMENT PERSPECTIVE. AND ALSO AS A WAY TO CAUSE IMMEDIATE PAIN FOR FINANCIAL REWARD. I BELIEVE THE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE ATTACKS SUCH AS THE ONES AGAINST COLONIAL PIPELINE AND THE RECENT ATTACK AGAINST A FLORIDA WATER TREATMENT PLANT ARE MORE COMMON THAN POPULARLY KNOWN. AND ARE UNDERFUNDED REPORTED. IN MY EXPERIENCE DIRECTORS HAVE. BREACHED THE TRADITIONAL IT SYSTEMS OF THE STATE OF THESE UTILITIES USUALLY DO NOT MAKE THE MEDIA HOP TO THE INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS. BUT I OFTEN DO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY BUT I'M SURE THIS COMMITTEE IS AWARE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER CONDUCTED A PENETRATION TEST. TO DETERMINE THEIR SUSCEPTIBILITY TO BEING ATTACKED IS PUBLICLY REPORTED THAT ONLY TOOK SIX HOURS FOR THE EVALUATOR SUCCESSFULLY BREACHED THE NETWORK. BUT THERE IS CLEAR AND. PRESENT YOUR UTILITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY. AND WHILE UTILITIES AT ERICA SKATER JUST BEFORE. THE TWO THOUSAND TEN SPREAD OF STUXNET WHICH SUCCESSFULLY TARGETED IRANIAN CENTRIFUGES PROOF THE AIR GOT NETWORKS ARE NOT INFALLIBLE. THEY DEVELOPER PREVENT MANY NORMAL TAX. FOR SOMEONE AT SOME POINT WE'LL PLUG THEIR LAPTOP INTO BOTH NETWORKS TO DO THEIR JOBS OR THEY'LL TRANSFER THREAT B. R. U. S. B. ROCK. WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED FOR THIS TO HAPPEN BECAUSE THAT HAS HAPPENED AND IT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN. WITHOUT THREAT ACTORS ARE TARGETING THEIR ATTACKS WE'RE SEEING BOTH. TRULY TARGETED ATTACKS AND MORE COMMONLY TARGETS OF OPPORTUNITY. I BELIEVE THE MAJORITY OF ATTACKS SO WE SEE ON U. S. UTILITIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE THE SECOND VARIETY TARGETS OF OPPORTUNITY. BY USING INTERNET SCANNING TOOLS SUCH A SHOWDOWN ATTACKERS COMBINED VULNERABILITIES EXPOSED TO THE INTERNET. AND A TIME TO VARIETY OF DIFFERENT LOGGINS USING COMMONLY KNOWN PASSWORDS. OTHER TIMES CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE TARGETS ARE JUST PART OF A MUCH LARGER CAMPAIGN TO IN FACT ANYONE WHO COLLECTS. THE COLONIAL PIPELINE ATTACK MAYBE SUCH AN EXAMPLE BASED ON PUBLICLY VAILABLE INTELLIGENCE IF POSSIBLE THE DARKSIDE RANSOM GANG AFFILIATE THEY'RE NOT PURPOSELY TARGET THE COLONIAL PIPELINE. AS IT HAS APPARENTLY EXPOSED HIM TO UNWANTED. FOCUS FROM THE LAW ENFORCEMENT. WITH SAID SOMETIME THESE ARE. TALK TAX O'CONNOR. TO AND WHEN ADVERSARIES DO A TACTICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IT REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO OUR SAFETY AND NATIONAL SECURITY. STARTED OUR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE COMPONENTS I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU BILL THESE ADOPTING THE US ICS SEARCH LIST AFFECT PROCESS BEST PRACTICES. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SHOULD CONSIDER ADOPTING MISSED I ASKED TO USE RISK BASED CYBERSECURITY FRAMEWORK. IF ORGANIZATIONS FALL THESE PROTOCOLS AND CUSTOMER CONTROLS ON A REGULAR BASIS. EVER IN THE COUNTRY WOULD ACTUALLY BE MUCH MORE SAFE AS A RESULT. IN CONCLUSION UTILITIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE UNDENIABLY FACING A RISE IN THE RATE AND SEVERITY OF CYBER SECURITY TAX. AS A NETWORK DEFENDER WHO REGULARLY WORKS WITH UTILITIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD. I'M ALWAYS ASTOUNDED BY THE DEDICATION AND PROFESSIONALISM OF THE PEOPLE ATTENDING THESE ORGANIZATIONS. THEY'RE HAMPERED BY LOW BUDGETS STAFFING CHALLENGES AND STATES THAT ARE EXTREMELY HIGH. THEY NEED IMPROVE SUPPORT MORE RESOURCES AND MODERN IT INSIDE SCRITTI TOOLS TO MEET THEIR EVER EVOLVING CYBERSECURITY THREATS THAT THEY FACE THAT'S THE THRUST THE WORLD. THANK YOU AND. I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COKER AND A- WEEK OF THE FIRST PANEL. RON BOUCHARD. Q- OF. COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY- FROM BUT CERTAIN- CTO FOR INSTALLATIONS THAT ARE OUR GLOBAL SO SERVICE FIRM THAT SPECIALIZES. IN RESPONDING TO. AFTER IS- IN BOTH LOCAL AND GOVERNMENT SECTOR ALL IS MISSION CRITICAL AND CRITICAL STRUCTURE AROUND THE WORLD I EIGHT ECHO A NUMBER OF THE POINTS THAT I MIGHT ANALYSTS HAVE MADE A READY IN TERMS OF BOTH RISKS AND EXPOSURES THAT WERE OBSERVING- CROSSED A CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. YOUR LETTERS AND FEDERAL AND WE WORK CLOSE BUT I'M ASIDE ACT III SKIN AND MANY OTHER BROKERS- IN RECENT NATIONAL ELECTIONS BEGAN TO DURING CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AGAINST- INTERFERENCE AN INTRUSION AND OF COURSE WE'RE CONTINUING TO SEE EFFECTIVE OTHER TYPES OF ATTACKS IMPACTING BOAT. OKAY LET ME STRUCTURE AS BOTH OPEN. BESIDES THIS OP IN THE COUNTRY WELL IT'S. IN THAT LIST IS SOME. BACK ON YOUR NEARLY ARE A GLOBAL IS THERE IS THIS ONE KEY FACTOR WE ARE MISTER BUSH HOW ARE YOU- DO YOU CAN THAT- YOUR BOTTOM LINE. WE DON'T HAVE SIGNAL YOU TURN OFF YOUR VIDEO. SEE IF THAT HELPS BECAUSE WE CAN'T HEAR YOU THAT CLEARLY. HOW DOES IT- BEING EIGHT OR- THE ACT OF RANBIR STATED BY SEVERAL OF THE PANELISTS CITY IN A ONE YEAR. IN NINETEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY RESULT IS 11% INCREASE FROM. TWO FULL QUARTER OF ARTISTIC AGENTS INVOLVED RANSOMWARE TWENTY TWENTY WE ANTICIPATE ANOTHER DOUBLE TO INCREASE OF MASOCHISTIC IN TWENTY ONE EIGHT IT IS CERTAINLY A TREND THAT WE'RE SEEING ON BOTH AT A- LEVEL BUT ALSO FRANKLY DEPORTED BY. YES BY STATE SPONSORED. COURT IF HE'S OUT FOR ITS IT KEEPS. ALIGHT COMMITTEE. I THAT HAVE TO REACT TO THESE TYPES OF TYPICALLY IN A NORMAL. ALL US CYBER INTRUSION AND DEFENDER. IF SERVER WHICH BERKELEY WORKING ORDERED UNC RESPOND TO THESE SORTS OF INCH. RIGHT TO WEAR. AVERAGE ARE GLOBAL AT. EVERY JOB IS A TIME FOR ACTIVE DEPARTMENT THE TIME THAT THE- LLOYD IS AROUND IT AT LEAST VERY LOW. BYE TO RESPOND AND REACT TO THE FOR THE ACT. MOTIONS STATION I LOOKED I SAW PANELLISTS THERE'S OTHER REASONS ANTAGONISMS AT PLAY HERE. WE FIVE PEOPLE GAIN ENTRY AND NOT AND STATE SPONSORED INTERFERENCE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THEFT- AND JUST OPPORTUNISTIC ADVANTAGE OF VULNERABILITIES THAT THAT ARE BEING FOUNDED INCREASING RATE- BY- ADVERSARIES AND SHARED FRANKLY ON THE BLACK MARKET IN IN IN DARK. REFORMS AROUND THE WORLD WHICH ALSO INCREASES BOTH THE APERTURE AND- IMPACT OF THESE SORTS OF ATTACKS ON ORGANIZATIONS WORLDWIDE THE TOP THE TOP INDUSTRIES THAT WE ARE OBSERVING THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNDER ATTACK CERTAINLY DO INCLUDE GOVERNMENT. I DON'T ALIGN ORGANISE BAKED I WOULD HIGHLIGHT A FEW OTHER SECTORS SECTORS THAT MAYBE HAVEN'T ABOUT THROUGH TALK ABOUT IT TODAY- INCLUDING HEALTHCARE WE SAW A MASSIVE INCREASE THE FOCUS ON THE- HEALTHCARE SECTOR ESPECIALLY DURING THE COLD ATTACK THAT MAKE. AGAIN BOTH AN OPPORTUNISTIC AS WELL AS A VITAL OPPORTUNITY FOR MANY- ORGANIZATIONS ARE CRIMINAL- ALIGNED ORGANIZATIONS AND THEN I WOULD ALSO HIGHLIGHT A DECENT BUSINESS A PROFESSIONAL SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS THAT SUPPORT- MANY OF THESE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PARTNERS. THAT ARE ALSO AN AVENUE FOR ACCESS AND ATTACKED BY THREAT ACTORS AROUND THE WORLD. WE DO ANTICIPATE AND- IT CONCUR WITH THE TREND LINES THAT WE'RE SEEING IN TERMS OF BOTH THE FOCUS THAT IT ATTACKS AND IF FREQUENCY AND IMPACT OF THESE SORTS OF- EACH. REASONS BOTH- AND IN. STRUCTURE IN STATE OF THE MONTHS AND YEARS TO COME I UNDERSTAND MAYBE MIGHT CONNECTION IS ABOUT SO I'LL SEE IF I CONTACT THEM AND GET IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT- THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND I JUST WANT TO- WELCOME BOTH ASSEMBLY MEMBER AT CHAO AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF THE APPROVED WIDE TO THE HEARING- DO EITHER OF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AFTER THE FIRST A PANEL. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAD THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MADAM CHAIR OF LET ME START OFF BY THANKING YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS TOPIC- I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS. FOR A LONG TIME SO I TRULY APPRECIATE HI YOU KNOW YOUR EFFORT AND YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS TOPIC AND NOT HAVING TO SATURDAY'S MEET MEETING SOMETHING SO WE GOT THE LET ME ALSO THANK ALL THE PRESENTERS FOR SHARING YOUR INSIGHTS AND- AND I ALL WALKED IN A LITTLE BIT LATE SO I APOLOGIZE IF MY QUESTIONS. HAVE ALREADY BEEN ANSWERED I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- I MADE A MANAGER OF FIRST QUESTION- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT- A LOT OF THE CRITICAL. INFRASTRUCTURE ASSETS. OR OTHERWISE AND MY QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT- HI YOU KNOW THAT PRESENTS A PROBLEM WHEN IT COMES TO NOTIFICATION OR WORKING WITH THE STATE OR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- BECAUSE SOMETIMES PRIVATE SECTORS OFF ARE UNCOMFORTABLE SHARING CERTAIN INFORMATION- PARTICULARLY UP ABOUT CYBER SECURITY BREACHES AND THE LIKE. AND YET WHETHER OR NOT- YOU KNOW THAT FACT I EAT- YOU KNOW THESE ASSETS ARE BEING- OWN PRIVATELY- WOULD PRESENT- ANY CHALLENGES IN AND IF SO WHAT ARE SOME OF THE- POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS- TO ADDRESS THAT- WHY DON'T WE START WITH MISTER A- CANCEL. AND THEN IF ANYBODY ELSE HAS ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD AND- SURE AND THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- SO- I. PERSONALLY DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE PRESENTATION- YOU KNOW IN HERE THAT'S- ON THE SHARING YOU KNOW THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR HAS A LONG TRACK RECORD OF TAKING CYBERSECURITY RISK OR- SECURITY RISK IN GENERAL VERY SERIOUSLY- AND ACTUALLY HAS BEEN SHARING- ON FOR. WELL OVER TWO DECADES YOU KNOW INFORMATION ABOUT THIS RATIONALE AND THAT CONTINUES TO INCREASE THAT BEING SAID THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE SHARING AND MAINTAINING SITUATIONAL AWARENESS. EXISTS AND SO WE TRY TO DO THAT BY DEMONSTRATING THE VALUE OF INFORMATION SHARING WHICH IS REALLY MAINTAINING SITUATIONAL AWARENESS RIGHT. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS TO ONE OF US COULD HAPPEN TO ANOTHER ONE OF OUR MEMBERS- AND THAT IS REALLY WHAT THE ISAC FOCUSES ON IN TERMS OF GETTING INFORMATION. OUT TO THAT THAT BEING SAID- YES THAT THERE IS YOU KNOW OCCASIONALLY SOMEONE LOCKED THEMSELVES THE PRICKLY WHERE THERE'S CONCERNS ABOUT ATTRIBUTION. OR PENALTY OR OR- OTHER LIABILITIES THAT MADE HER AND I THINK THAT'S THE OPPORTUNITY IN FRONT OF US THAT WE HAVE TO YOU KNOW GIVEN THE SOPHISTICATION OF THE STRAP. WE ACTING CAN ENCOURAGE. ALL THE PARTIES IN THIS ECOSYSTEM TO CONTINUE TO SHARE- OUR WITH AND WITHOUT FEAR- ATTRIBUTION OR PENALTY- AND REALLY TRY TO FACILITATE THAT. SO ONE OF THINGS WE DO TO THAT END OF THE E. ISAC IS OUR MEMBERS CAN ACTUALLY SHARE ANONYMOUSLY THEY CAN POST INFORMATION ON OUR PORTAL. AND THEY CAN ACTUALLY CHOOSE WHO GETS SHARED WELL RIGHT AND WE THINK THAT'S A POWERFUL WAY OF AGAIN- GETTING INFORMATION AND THEN ALLOWING US TO- SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THE SECTOR. AND EVEN WITH OUR GOVERNMENT PARTNERS AS WELL. HE HAD COME YES YOU- NEXT QUESTION I DEALS WITH BRANDS. AND I THINK AS THE PANELISTS SO HAVE POINTED OUT IN THE YOU KNOW THAT THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF THESE RANSOMWARE ATTACK SO- ON ON ON THE RICE- EXPONENTIALLY IN FACT. AND I NOTICED ALSO THAT- A LOT OF THESE RANSOMWARE SITUATIONS INVOLVE. THE USE OF A CRYPTOCURRENCY CAL THEY'RE BEING T. PAY BY BITCOIN AND THE LIKE. AND SO I'M WONDERING IN ADDITION TO ALL THE SUGGESTIONS THAT'S BEEN MADE OF FOR EXAMPLE- HAVING- BEST PRACTICES AND THE LIKE. BUT IN HAVING BACKUP SO OBVIOUSLY. I'M WONDERING WHETHER ONE OF THE- POSSIBLE AVENUES TO PURSUE WOULD BE TO LOOK AT THE YOU KNOW THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE CRYPTOCURRENCY- INFRASTRUCTURE BASICALLY. AND YOUR DO SOMETHING VERY IT YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE WHATEVER THE CASE MAYBE IT. WOULD BE DISCLOSURE OR OTHERWISE SO IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT AS. WELL EITHER THE STATE OR THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AT AN- LET'S SEE- THAT PERHAPS A- MISTER CLARK MANY. YEAH. REGARDING THE DESTRUCTION OF THE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE I WOULD SAY FROM A RANSOMWARE POINTED TO DO YOU'RE YOU'RE CERTAINLY CORRECT YOUR PERSON THAT THE- OR SORRY A SIMPLE PERSON. THAT THE- RANSOMWARE PAYMENTS ARE CURRENTLY BEING PAID SIGNIFICANTLY WITH CRYPTO COIN THE BERRIES VARIETIES HOWEVER I CAN'T SAY THAT I'M EXPERT ENOUGH TO COMMENT UPON THE ABILITY DISRUPT THOSE MARKET PLACES. ARE SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE SOME OF THE CRYPTOCOIN MARKETS ARE DESIGNED TO SPECIFICALLY AVOID GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND EVERYTHING ALONG THOSE LINES SO IT BECOMES DIFFICULT. BECAUSE THERE ARE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF CRYPTO COINS THAT ARE USED ARE THE MOST COMMON OF COURSE HAS BEEN BIG POINT. WHICH WE CAN SEE FROM THE- RECENT COLONIAL PIPELINE AND THE DARK SIDE TAKE DOWN BY THE US GOVERNMENT THAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY ABLE TO RECOVER SOME OF THAT- IT APPEARS THAT MANY RANSOMWARE OPERATORS ARE BEGINNING TO MOVE AWAY FROM BITCOIN AS PRIMARY PAYMENT METHOD BECAUSE OF THAT DISRUPTION SO- THAT'S MOST PARK ON COMFORTABLE GOING INTO DETAILS BUT I CAN'T SAY FOR SIGNIFICANT DIFFICULTIES WITH DISRUPTING THAT MARKHAM. AS OF MAYBE MR BOUCHARD HAS SOMETHING TO ADD ON THAT. YES I MEAN FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD SEVERAL DISCUSSIONS- WITH CITY COUNCIL AS WELL AS- YOUR CONGRESS ON THIS TOPIC AND THERE IS. A GROWING THOUGHT PROCESS THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME SORT OF- BUT YOUR REGULATED OR NO DISCLOSURE NOTIFICATION OF PAYMENT THERE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED. SINS OF THE OF BANNING FORMER IN SOMEWAY OUTLAWING SOME PAYMENTS IN ORDER TO CUT OFF THE FINANCE BOB DOLE THAT SPENDING. CREASING EXPONENTIAL WE- TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THAT OF COURSE PUTS A LOT OF VICTIMS IN JEOPARDY WHEN IT COMES TO RECOVERY OF. THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR SYSTEMS UNFORTUNATELY SO THIS IS INTELLIGENT THE PROBLEM I DON'T KNOW THAT- REGULATION OF THE CRYPTO MARKET WILL NESSA'S DEARLY BEAR FRUIT ESPECIALLY IN THE TIME FRAME THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAYBE THAT'S A- A LONGER TERM ADDRESSABLE. PROBLEM SAID I THINK IN THE SHORT TERM SOME SORT OF POTENTIAL- LIABILITY PROTECTION OR SHIELDING ALONG WITH DISCLOSURE- EITHER PRIOR TO OR IMMEDIATELY AFTER A RANSOM PAYMENT IN ORDER TO ENABLE LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BETTER TRACK. AND PROSECUTE THESE SORTS OF PAYMENTS MAY BE A MIDDLE GROUND THAT- THAT MAKES SENSE INTO TO STEM THE TIDE. HE DOES THAT THE AND THE FUNDING THAT'S FLOWING IN AND FRANKLY ENABLING- THE INCREASING AMOUNT OF CYBER- YOU KNOW OPERATIONS. THAT WERE SEEN AGAINST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND ONE FINAL QUESTION AND I THINK ONE OF THE PANELISTS- TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SEGMENTATION SO FOR CLARIFICATION PURPOSES I'M JUST WONDERING IF DOT CONCEPT REALLY. UP ENCOMPASSES OR- SIMPLY MEANS THAT WE ARE SECOND SEGMENTING VARIOUS PARTS OF THIS OF THE NETWORK SO THAT. A ONE IF INFECTED SEGMENT WOULD NOT. AFFECT OTHER SEGMENTS OF YOU KNOW OF THE OF THE SYSTEM- WITHIN THE INFRASTRUCTURE JUST A- CONVOCATION QUESTION. MAYBE MR CANCEL ON THAT ONE. SURE- SO- SEGMENTATION- IS AS YOU POINT OUT IS CERTAINLY A- A METHOD TO PREVENT FURTHER INFECTIONS- YOU KNOW TO KEEP INFECTIONS YOU KNOW WELL LOCATED WHERE IT STARTED AND NOT NECESSARILY TRAVERSING LATTERLY WHEN YOU'RE ON THE OTHER- Q. VANTAGE THE SEGMENTATION IS REALLY RESTRICT ACCESS RIGHT AND SO AGAIN IN THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR THERE'S BEEN A LONG TIME PRACTICE OF SEGMENTING THE ENERGY DELIVERY NETWORKS OF THE CONTROL THAT WORKS. FROM THE ENTERPRISE NETWORKS I'M SO THAT REMAINS A BEST PRACTICE RIGHT ALL THE CHALLENGED AREAS SO IT'S OUR ADVERSARIES HAVE PROVEN IS THAT THEY CAN GET BACK- GET PAST THAT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID THEY GET THROUGH MISCONFIGURED SYSTEMS SO THEY AKE ADVANTAGE OF VULNERABILITIES. THAT EXIST IN THOSE PLATFORM SO THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN SOFTWARE CURRENCY AND PATCH SYSTEMS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE- AND THAT'S WHAT ENABLED THEM TO GET ACCESS THE OTHER THING AND WE SAW THIS IN THE COLONIAL PIPELINE ATTACK WHERE AGAIN BE OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS WERE NOT COMPROMISED BY THE RANSOMWARE BUT KEY ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS THAT WERE YOU KNOW CRITICAL TO THE OPERATION. OF THOSE SYSTEMS WERE COMPROMISED SO YOU KNOW WE WOULD ENCOURAGE ENTERPRISES TO REALLY TAKE A LOOK AT THEIR INVENTORY OF APPLICATIONS IN THE SASH WHICH APPLICATIONS ON THE CORPORATE NETWORK OR ENTERPRISE NETWORKS ARE CRITICAL TO THE OPERATION. OF THE OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY NETWORKS. THANK YOU GERMAN I YOU MANAGER ALL RIGHT AND I WANT TO ALL OUR PANELISTS FROM. THE FIRST PANEL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR US- TO AND FOR YOUR PATIENCE BECAUSE OF COURSE WE'RE INTO A DIFFERENT TIME- SO WE ARE GOING TO MOVE ON TO THE PANEL TO. AND WE HAVE. A LOT OF GREAT SPEAKERS HERE AND I WILL ASK YOU SINCE WE DO HAVE US SIX PANELISTS SAID EVERYBODY MAKE SURE TO. KEEP THEIR REMARKS TWO OF FIVE MINUTES WE HAVE TO FROM THE WATER SECTOR TO FROM- THE ELECTRICITY AND GAS ONE FROM ELECTRICITY AND ONE FROM GAS AND- THAT WILL BE- NICK SANTA LOW FROM CALIFORNIA AMERICAN WATER DAVE PATTERSON THE GENERAL MANAGER OF THE LAS VIRGENES MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT- MARTIN STRASBOURG OR A SENIOR DIRECTOR OF CYBER SECURITY AT PG&amp;E. MISTER LAST MUELLER THE DIRECTOR OF CYBER SECURITY AND COMPLIANCE AT SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC KEVIN GRANT THE A PRINCIPAL MANAGER OF CYBERSECURITY AT SOCAL EDISON. AND JORGE SILVA THE OPERATIONS MANAGER FOR THE CITY OF PALO ALTO- THE GAS DEPARTMENT AND- YOU GUYS ARE AT THE FOREFRONT SO WE'RE VERY INTERESTED IN HEARING WHAT YOU HAVE TO- SAY AND WHY DON'T WE START WITH MR SENTHIL UP. THANKS OKAY THAT IS YOUR CHANCE ISN'T HERE YET I DO HAVE MISTER PATTERSON. OKAY WHY DON'T WE START WITH MR PATTERSON. GOOD MORNING CHAIRWOMAN AND NOT MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HI MY NAME IS DAVID PETERSON I'M THE GENERAL MANAGER OF LAS VIRGENES MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT AND ALSO CHAIR OF THE AQUA ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES. OUR WATER MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE- I REPRESENT A WHAT WOULD BE CALLED THE SMALL TO MEDIUM SIZED OUR WATER AND WASTEWATER UTILITY WE ARE PROVIDE SERVICE AT THE RETAIL LEVEL AND SERVE THE WESTERNMOST PORTION OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY. OUR PUBLIC AGENCY AND COVERED BY A FIVE MEMBER ELECTED BOARD% OF DIRECTORS. WHAT I'LL DO IT IN A VERY BRIEF WAY IF YOU HAVE- GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THREE MAJOR TRENDS THAT I SEE HI IN TERMS OF OUR CYBER SECURITY POSTURE OF WATER AND WASTEWATER UTILITIES ARE SIMILAR TO MINE. HI AND- THAT MAY BE HELPFUL IN FURTHERING THE DISCUSSION. THE FIRST TREND THAT I WANTED TO POINT OUT WHICH I WOULD SAY IS A VERY POSITIVE ONE IS THAT- I AM SEEING A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN FOCUS AMONG LEADERS AND ELECTED OFFICIALS RESPONSIBLE FOR WATER AND WASTEWATER UTILITIES ON. CYBER THREAT AND THE IMPORTANCE OF INVESTMENT IN CYBER SECURITY AND THAT'S REALLY EIGHT OF OUR USUAL THING AND A HELPFUL THING- AND I THINK THIS COMES IN TWO FORMS ONE IN TERMS OF LITERACY AND SO MYSELF I AM NOT AN I. T. PROFESSIONAL- WATER AGENCY MANAGER. BUT I SEE AN INCREASE LITERACY AMONG MY COLLEAGUES AND ALSO OUR ELECTED BOARD. ON CYBER SECURITY. BOB THE DAYS ARE CYPRUS. ARE BEING I. T. FOR ARE ARE LONG. AND CYPRUS NOW IS AN IMPORTANT STRATEGIC PRIORITY OF ANY UTILITY INCLUDING MY OWN- FOR MY UTILITY WE CONSIDER. ARE PREPARING AND RESPONDING FOR THE THREAT OF CYBER ATTACK AS RISING TO BE ON PAR WITH THOSE FROM NATURAL DISASTER AND THOSE WOULD BE FIRE EARTHQUAKE AND FLOOD. AND I OPERATE IN AN AREA OF THE STATE WHERE OP FIRES A SIGNIFICANT THREAT. THERE'S REALLY TWO DRIVERS ONE IS THAT WERE SEEN AN INCREASED FREQUENCY AND- THE CROWD. AND IT'S REALLY AN OCCURRENCE THAT'S ALMOST DAILY- DALY MAYBE ON A SMALLER SCALE OF FISHING AND THAT TYPE OF THING BUT THESE ARE THREATS THAT ARE ROUTINE NOW- AND RELATED TO- BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY. AND ALSO WE'VE SEEN INCREASED OUR FOCUS- AT THE LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY LEVEL ON ENSURING THAT UTILITIES ARE I'M DOING A GOOD JOB IN TERMS OF PREPARING BOB THAT HAS HAPPENED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL- BEGINNING FOLLOWING THE NINE ELEVEN ATTACKS AND THAT WAS THE TWO THOUSAND AND TWO. BIOTERRORISM ACT AND I WOULD SAY IN THE TEN YEARS THAT FOLLOWED THAT THERE WASN'T A BIG FOCUS ON THE PHYSICAL SECURITY. OF MORE RECENTLY CONGRESS PASSED THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN AMERICA'S WATER INFRASTRUCTURE ACT. AND THAT HAS REALLY. BROADENED THAT THE FOCUS OF THE BIOTERRORISM ACT TO INCLUDE- IN MORE EARNEST CYBER SECURITY AND- WATER AGENCIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE NOW. INCORPORATED RISK ASSESSMENTS AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES IN ORDER TO RESPOND TO THOSE THREATS. SO THE SECOND TREND- THAT I WANTED TO MENTION IS A TREND OF MOVING. TOWARDS INCREASED RELIANCE IN WATER WASTEWATER UTILITIES ON AUTOMATION. MORE SOPHISTICATED INDUSTRIAL CONTROL. SYSTEMS ARE CLOUDBASE AS COMPUTING AND THEN MOST RECENTLY ARTISTS AND MACHINE LEARNING. AND SO THIS COMES WITH TWO PARTS IT COMES IN NOT THE FORM OF NEW RISK. IN THAT HOT ALL OF THESE SYSTEMS PRESENT NEW POINTS OF ENTRY POTENTIALLY TO- OUR SYSTEMS AND CAN PRESENT NEW THREATS. BUT ALSO PRESENTS OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK WITH COMPANIES WHO ARE INDUSTRY LEADERS AND WHO EMPLOY MORE SOPHISTICATED SECURITY SYSTEMS THEN WHAT WE WOULD. NORMALLY BE ABLE TO IN OUR OWN UTILITIES SO- IT COMES WITH- BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE- IT ALSO REALLY ELEVATES THE IMPORTANCE OF SELECTING PARTNERS AND CONSIDERING OUR SECURITY. AND THE CAPABILITY OF YOUR PARTNERS IN PROVIDING SECURITY FOR BOTH YOUR OPERATIONS AND YOUR SYSTEMS. AND THEN I JUST WANTED TO ADD THE THIRD MAJOR TREND- WHICH IS A CHALLENGE IS THAT WE ARE FACING IN THE INDUSTRY AND INCREASED. INCREASING COST ACROSS THE BOARD AND AT THE SAME TIME AND INCREASED FOCUS ON PROVIDING AFFORDABLE SERVICE AND SO INVESTMENTS IN CYBERSECURITY DO COME WITH THAT CHALLENGE IN THE CONTEXT OF RISING COSTS. TO PROVIDE YOU TO UTILITY SERVICES IN GENERAL. AND TRYING TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE SERVICE AND SO WHAT I'M FINDING IS THAT- FREQUENTLY UTILITIES LIKE MINE- WHEN WE DO CONDUCT A RISK ASSESSMENT. WE NEED TO EMPLOY AN EMPLOYMENT THE RESPONSE MEASURES AND IMPROVEMENTS TO SECURITY OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. AND SOMETIMES THOSE CAN BE COSTLY I PARTICULARLY IN TERMS OF HIRING- THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXPERTISE IN THESE AREAS- AND- IN THE CASE OF A SMALLER AGENCY LIKE MINE THAT I CAN BE. A CHALLENGE SO I THANK YOU FOR- OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY AND LOOK FORWARD. TO QUESTIONS THAT MAY FALL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE WILL ON TO OF MY STRASBOURG- YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MARTIN STRASBOURG HERE I AM A SENIOR DIRECTOR AT PACIFIC GAS ELECTRIC COMPANY. IN IT GIGI NEED FOR TEN YEARS AND THE LAST YOU I'VE BEEN. RUNNING OUR CYBER SECURITY TEAM PRIOR TO THAT IRAN OR SECURITY INTELLIGENCE AND OPERATIONS CENTER- SO. BEEN ABLE TO OBSERVE THAT EVOLUTION OF CYBER THREATS TO OUR SECTOR. OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS AND I WILL SPEND A LITTLE TIME HERE MAKING SOME- COMMENTS AND I THINK IT ALL DRESSED SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I'VE I'VE ALREADY HEARD. OFTEN THE FOLKS THERE- FIRST OFF- RIGHT RIGHT KNOW I SPEAK FOR THE ENTIRE- UTILITY SECTOR IN MY PEERS WHEN I SAY THAT- WE ABSOLUTELY TAKE CYBERTHREATS TO. GAS ELECTRIC GENERATION ARE VERY SERIOUSLY- YES INDEED THAT THAT THREAT HAS BEEN INCREASING- OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS ATTY EVERY DAY YOU LOOK IN THE PAPER YOU SEE ANOTHER NUMBER REPORT TEST SOMETHING SOMETHING HAPPENING AND WE ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS RECORD SERIOUSLY I KNOW LEADERSHIP AT OUR COMPANY- INSURERS THAT WE HAVE APPROPRIATE RESOURCES BUDGET- FOCUS AT THE BOARD LEVEL TO YOU TO DO THE THINGS WE NEED TO DO TO PROTECT- REALLY ARE THE SAFETY AND RELIABILITY OF GAS ELECTRIC SERVICE IN THE- IN THE STATE SO. WE TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY SO WHAT ARE THE COUPLE KEY POINTS THAT I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT- FOUNDATION AB- WE HAVE ADOPTED ACT STUPID GAS ELECTRIC THE NIST'S CYBERSECURITY FRAMEWORK. I KNOW A LOT OF YOUR UTILITIES AS WELL AS GOVERNMENT ENTITIES USE THE NECESSARY SECURITY FRAMEWORK SO STANDARDISATION ANA COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK THAT HELPS YOU ENSURE YOU'VE GOT AA- OB BROAD COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM COVERING. ALL THE ASPECTS THAT YOU'D BE EXPECTED CHUJ POWER IN THE CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM YES IT'S VERY IMPORTANT JOB I'VE BEEN HAPPY TO SEE OUR ADOPTION THAT FRAMEWORK OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS- WE ALSO HAVE BEEN- SPURRED ALONG BY. A REGULATION COMING FROM THE FEDERAL LEVEL YOUR ACCEPT REGULATION IS BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME AND- WHILE ANY REGULATORY SCHEME- YOU KNOW TAKES TIME AND EFFORT TO COMPLY WITH THAT. THE REAL INTENT BEHIND THAT NURSE IF REGULATIONS ARE VERY IMPORTANT. FOCUS ON YOUR MOST CRITICAL SYSTEMS IN THIS CASE ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION AND POWER YOUR YOUR YOUR BEST SECURITY CONTROLS FOCUSED ON PROTECTING THOSE SYSTEMS WE'VE RECENTLY SEEN- REALLY ON THE HEELS OF THE COLONIAL PIPELINE INCIDENT THAT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT TODAY- THAT DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY- PUBLISHING. PIPELINE OUR SECURITY DIRECTIVES TO WE HAVE THE FIRST HI PLAN SECURITY DIRECTIVE COME OUT AT THE BEGINNING OF. JUNE I AND WE UNDERSTAND AND HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE IT DROPPED OUT MORE STRINGENT- REGULATIONS. THAT ARE COMING OUT SO- IT'S A GOOD THING REASONABLE REGULAR. THAT ARE REAL HELPED. OUT SICK ORGANISED. NOW GAS PI- VERY GOOD IDEA WE WILL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO CHEW UP- MEET THOSE STANDARDS- COUPLE MORE ITEMS- WE HEAVILY RELY ON- OUR PARTNERS ARE VENDORS THAT THAT COMPANIES THAT MANUFACTURE IN OUR CASE TRANSFORMERS ELECTRONIC RELAYS ARM SOFTWARE TO MANAGE OUR ENVIRONMENT SO- IT'S NOT JUST US UTILITIES ARE WHO REALLY NEED TO STEP UP TO THE CHALLENGE IT'S- IT'S OUR OUR PARTNERS ARE VENDORS THAT. NEED TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE VERY STRINGENT SUPPLY CHAIN SECURITY CONTROLS SO THAT WHEN WE DO PURCHASE FOR EXAMPLE A NETWORK MONITORING SOLUTION- WE HAVE A HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE THAT THAT THAT SOFTWARE IS GOING TO MAINTAIN ITS INTEGRITY- UNFORTUNATELY WHAT SOLAR WINDS AND WITH THAT THE RECENT APPETITE ASSET TAX- THIS ISN'T ANYTHING NEW BUT IT MADE IT VERY. VERY OBVIOUS HOW IMPORTANT SUPPLY CHAIN SECURITY IS- AT THAT THE LEVEL I DO KNOW THERE ARE A VARIETY OF ACTIVITIES GOING ON RELATED TO SUPPLY CHAIN SECURITY BUT- I KNOW P. JEANNIE. DEFINITELY SUPPORT SAT CONTINUED FOCUS ON SUPPLY CHAIN SECURITY IN ENSURING- THAT WE CAN TRUST THAT THAT EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE THAT THAT WE GET- I'M- TRYING WE ALL SAY YOU KNOW- AGAIN HEY THANKS FOR INVITING US TO THIS OUR PANEL. WHAT WHAT THE STATE COULD YOU TO HELP US BE SUCCESSFUL- IS PLEASE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ACROSS THE STATE EVEN STARTING IN HIGH SCHOOL BUT DEFINITELY IN OUR UNIVERSITIES AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES- SERVICE FUERTE PROGRAMS THAT PRODUCE- FOLKS WHO ARE READY TO STEP INTO COMPANIES LIKE PG&amp;E AND **** ENTRY LEVEL CYBERSECURITY ROLES THAT CAN TURN INTO. OUTSTANDING PANELISTS AND THEN EVEN THE NEXT SET OF LEADERS- IT'S VERY IMPORTANT- WE NEED IN DETAIL SECTOR CAN'T PAY WELL AS GOOGLE FACEBOOK NETFLIX XCERRA- SO WE ARE COMPETING FOR THE BEST TALENT AND THE MORE TALENT IT IS- BROUGHT UP THROUGH THE RANKS OF OUR OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. THE BETTER POSITION MORE AND SO I THINK THAT'S YOU KNOW MY FIVE MINUTES SOME KEY POINTS THERE. THANKS FOR HAVING ME AND WILL PASS IT ON TO THE NEXT ANALYST. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR STRASBOURG OR AND WE WILL MOVE ON TO. LANCE MUELLER. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING APPRECIATE THAT- MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY SO MY NAME IS MATTHEW ARE UP ON THE DIRECTOR OF CYBERSECURITY FOR SOCAL GAS AS WELL AS ESTY GENIE WE- SERVICE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILLION CONSUMERS IN THE GAS AND ELECTRIC- OF ENERGY DELIVERY- YOU KNOW MOST OF THE PANELISTS IT I AGREE WITH. ALL OF WHAT THEY'VE HAD YOU KNOW WAS MARTIN DESCRIBED CYBER SECURITY IS- IT SPECIALLY IN WITH OUR ORGANIZATION IS TREATED AT THE SAME LEVEL AS SAFETY RIGHT WHICH IS A TOP HURRY AROUND KEEPING OUR OUR CUSTOMERS IN OUR IN OUR EMPLOYEES SAFE- AND INTEGRITY HAS THAT SAME LEVEL OF IMPORTANCE. AND THAT REALLY STARTS AT THE TOP OF THEIR EXECUTOR YOU KNOW LEADERSHIP AND US SPONSORSHIP AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT- YOU KNOW BUDGET RESOURCES AND A COMMITMENT AND WE CERTAINLY DO. SO TO ECHO A LITTLE BIT AROUND WHAT MARTIN- DESCRIBED YOU KNOW A LOT OF UTILITIES ARE SIMILAR IN IN THE FRAMEWORKS- THAT WE THAT WE A DOCTOR THAT WE USE AND NEST- SPECIFICALLY EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY THREE IS A VERY SPECIFIC NEST FRAMEWORK ALONG WITH THE NEW CYBERSECURITY FRAMEWORK. ARE ARE VERY COMMON TOOLS USED IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN A LOT OF ENTITIES IN THE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE ENERGY DELIVERY. USE THOSE FRAMEWORKS- TO GUIDE US- AROUND THE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING AND MORE IMPORTANTLY HOW TO TEST OURSELVES RIGHT HOW TO BENCHMARK OURSELVES IN SO. YOU KNOW PART OF THAT IS DOING ROUTINE MATURITY ASSESSMENTS OF OURSELVES I MEAN BRINGING IN THIRD PARTIES TO DO THAT FOR US TO YOU KNOW BENCH MARKETS AGAINST THOSE STANDARDS IN AND THAT HELPS US. IDENTIFY WAYS TO IMPROVE OUR CAPABILITIES- AND THEN YOU KNOW THE PREVIOUS PANEL I THINK THE ONGOING INFORMATION SHARING IS ABSOLUTELY KEY I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH. HOW MANY TIMES WE HAVE HER THIRD THING THREE THAT IN. SHARE THAT HAS HELPED US KIND OF UP OUR SHIELDS. IMPROPER FOR SOMETHING BECAUSE ANOTHER UTILITY OR ENERGY COMPANY SAW IT. AND IT ALLOWS US TO QUICKLY REACTING AND YOU KNOW BENEFIT FROM KIND OF THAT CROWD SOURCING OF INFORMATION- AS FAR AS OUR SECURITY ASSESSMENTS WEEK WE ARE. ENGAGE A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT SERVICES WE USE A EXTERNAL BUG BOUNTY PROGRAM THAT IS OPERATIONAL TWENTY FOUR SEVEN. WE USE OUR QUARTERLY ADVERSARY EMULATIONS TO TEST OUR SYSTEMS- AND THEN WE ALSO ENGAGE WITH. FEDERAL PARTIES LIKE DHS AND TSA TO COME IN AND DO ASSESSMENTS WITHIN OUR THOSE MUCH LIKE THE FRAMEWORK- MATURITY ASSESSMENT THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER TO ASSESS OUR CAPABILITIES WHERE WE ALL ARE IN THE MATURITY LEVEL AND HOW DO WE GET TO THE NEXT LEVEL RIGHT NOW WITH. WHAT WE NEED TO DO NEXT TO GO UP FROM THERE- MARTIN DESCRIBED YOU KNOW SOME OF THE REGULATORY THINGS THAT WE FOLLOW NEW YORK SEPT ON THE ELECTRIC SIDE IS CLEARLY YOU KNOW THE- THE OVER ARCHING- REGULATORY BODY. THAT GOVERNS OUR GENERATION. IN IN TRANSMISSION AND IN SOME PARTS OF DISTRIBUTION. ANYTHING ASIDE FROM THAT WE ALSO HAVE THE NEXT FRAMEWORK AGAIN IT'S NOT REGULATORY HOWEVER IT'S FOLLOWED LIKE IT IS REGULATORY. AND WE HAVE SARBANES OXLEY AND THEN- YOU KNOW TSA DIRECTIVE IT JUST CAME OUT THAT MARTIN- FLEW TO WE CLEARLY FOLLOW THAT. AND THEN THE PREVIOUS PANEL MENTIONED CIS BENCHMARKS AND THEN THERE'S OTHERS LIKE THE AUSTRALIAN ESSENTIAL EIGHT WHICH ARE. ESSENTIALLY RECOMMENDATIONS WRITING BEST PRACTICES IN SO WE CONSTANTLY LOOK AT ALL OF THOSE RIGHT WE WE'RE WE DON'T FOCUS ON ONE IT'S KIND OF LIKE A DEFENSE IN AT ALL OF THOSE BEST PRACTICES AND THEN TRY TO ADOPT. YOU KNOW DOES. THAT MAKE SENSE FOR US AS A BUSINESS. THIS AS YOU KNOW WHAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST YEAR OR TWO CERTAINLY FROM THE PANDEMIC AS MANY PEOPLE WHAT REMOTE. WE DIDN'T SEE A HUGE INCREASE IN THREATS AGAINST OUR USERS WE SAW A CHANGE IN THE THREATS AGAINST OUR USERS. BECAUSE PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC WE WERE SEEING LOTS OF SPAM MALWARE THAT WAS COMING THROUGH EMAIL IN CERTAINLY SINCE THE PANDEMIC IN THE LAST YEAR WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF THAT SHIFT INTO CREDENTIAL HARVESTING RIGHT WHERE. FISHING IN A TRYING TO GET CREDENTIALS SO THAT THEY CAN GAIN REMOTE ACCESS INTO SOME OF OUR ENVIRONMENTS. AND IN IN THE POTENTIALLY DO FURTHER HARM FROM THEIR FROM THEIR- ADDITIONAL YOU KNOW THE THINGS THAT WE'VE SEEN IS YOU KNOW ATTACKERS QUICKLY LEVERAGING. VULNERABILITIES AS THEY ARE DISCLOSED RIGHT THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PRACTICE HOWEVER IN THE LAST YEAR OR TWO WE CLEARLY SEEN VULNERABILITIES THAT HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED MEANING. THE PRODUCT MANUFACTURERS COME OUT AND SAID YOU KNOW THIS PRODUCT HAS A VULNERABILITY WITHIN THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR TO THIRTY SIX HOURS. THERE IS A HUGE INCREASE IN ATTACKER ACTIVITY TRYING TO FIND COMPANIES WITH THAT PARTICULAR OWN ABILITY TO TRY TO GET THEIR FOOT IN THE DOOR. BEFORE THAT ORGANIZATION PATCHES THAT VULNERABILITY AND THAT IS THAT IS WHAT LET HAS LED TO SEVERAL MAJOR COMPROMISES IN THE LAST. BOB YOU KNOW SIX MONTHS WITH MANY ORGANIZATIONS- MARTIN ALSO DESCRIBED YOU KNOW. CYBER THIRD PARTY SUPPLY CHAIN RISK HAS BEEN A HUGE INCREASE ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF DUE TO THEIR RANSOMWARE ATTACK. YOU KNOW AS MANY OF YOUR WHERE YOU KNOW RANSOMWARE TYPICALLY INVOLVES AN EXTORTION TACTIC WHERE THEY STEAL DATA AND EVEN THOUGH YOU MIGHT HAVE THE ABILITY TO RECOVER. THEY WILL THEY WILL PUBLICLY DISCLOSE THAT DATA. AND SO SUDDENLY NOW WE HAVE TO PROTECT OURSELVES BUT ALSO OUR VENDORS AND OUR THIRD PARTIES WHO MIGHT GET TO BE A VICTIM OF A OF A RANSOMWARE ATTACK. THEY MIGHT HAVE SOME OF OUR DATA AND THAT DATA GET STOLEN. AND THEN THAT DATA BECOMES PART OF YOU DISTORTION PACKED. SO SHE INCREASE IN THIRD. SUPPLY CHAIN RISK- AND THEN THE LAST ONE I MENTION ABOUT IT IN INCREASES IT IS THE DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACKS OVER THE LAST YEAR OR SO WE'VE SEEN A HUGE INCREASE ACROSS UTILITIES AS WELL AS OTHER SECTORS LIKE FINANCIAL. HEALTH CARE IT CONTINUES TO BE A PROBLEM IN FACT THERE WAS ONE TODAY AGAINST ANOTHER UTILITY- AND IT'S ALL FOR MONEY IT'S AN EXTORTION RANSOM TYPE OF THING TO TRY TO KNOCK- YOU KNOW- THE COMPANY OFFLINE FOR DATES AND GET SOME SORT OF PAYMENTS- AND THEN FINALLY I'LL JUST WRAP UP WITH. YOU KNOW- WOULD MARTIN DESCRIBED AROUND YOU KNOW EDUCATION I WOULD EVEN GO AS FAR TO SAY DOWN INTO THE MIDDLE SCHOOL IS WHERE WE REALLY NEED TO BE. YOU KNOW PROVIDING SOME LEVEL OF CYBER SECURITY AWARENESS AND EDUCATION SO AS THEY MOVE UP INTO. HIGH SCHOOL AND THEN UNIVERSITY RIGHT IT BECOMES SECOND NATURE AND THEN WE ARE ABLE TO INCREASE THAT RESORT POOL BECAUSE THERE'S A HUGE SHORTAGE THERE AND THE MORE THAT WE CAN HELP BUILD THAT THE BETTER THAT WE WILL HAVE. SO WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT BACK OVER IN THE FOURTEEN QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MR MUELLER AND FINALLY. WE HAVE- CAL GRANT. TRYING TO GET A MINUTE HERE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN CHAIRWOMAN OR WOMEN MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY SELECT COMMITTEE ON CYBER SECURITY MY NAME IS KEVIN GRANT AND I'M THE PRINCIPAL MANAGER SERVICE CRITICS ON CALIFORNIA'S. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TO YOU TODAY. I THINK A LOT OF SOME COMMON THEMES AMONGST WHAT WE HAVE R. AS YOU HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUES. THE ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR IN THE UNITED STATES HAS A LONG HISTORY OF FACING THREATS TO INFRASTRUCTURE WHETHER THEY'RE NATURAL AND MAN MADE. POSSIBLE THREATS ARE INDEED MUCH MORE COMPLEX PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT SOME OF ARTS I REPRESENTATION ENGINE STATES. INDUSTRIES A STRONG FOUNDATION OF PREPAREDNESS RESILIENCE AND RESPONSE. SO MUCH PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE CAPABILITY OF CYBER ADVERSARIES CONTINUES TO EVOLVE AT A RAPID PACE. NOW REQUIRES A MORE STRATEGIC APPROACH TO THIS THREAT. I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE THREE COLORS A CREEK FUNDACION FOR STRONG SECURITY CULTURE. FIRST WE DID QUITE MULTI LAYERED DEFENSE IN DEPTH STRATEGY FOR DETECTION AND REMEDIATION AND RESPONSE. THIS IS VALIDATED BY CONDUCTING REGULAR PENETRATION TESTS AND EXERCISING OUR INCIDENT RESPONSE CAPABILITIES BOTH COMPANYWIDE. AND PARTICIPATING IN INDUSTRY WIDE EXERCISES SUCH AS BRICKS. IN ADDITION THE ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR HAS MANDATORY REGULAR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR CYBERSECURITY WHICH ENSURE A CONSISTENT SET OF STANDARDS REQUIREMENTS ACROSS THE INDUSTRY. HOWEVER WE APPRECIATE THE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS ONLY AT BASELINE AND THEREFORE MANY OF US LEVERAGE TOOLS SUCH AS- THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY CYBERSECURITY FRAMEWORK WHICH IS BEEN MENTIONS. AND MATURITY MODEL MODELS SUCH AS THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY CYBERSECURITY CAPABILITY MATURITY MODEL. TO CONTINUALLY IMPROVE OUR EFFORTS ACROSS THE BOARD. SECOND OUR PARTNERSHIPS PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN MITIGATING ONGOING CYBER THREATS PROGRESS. THE KEY TO OUR SUCCESS IN STRONG INDUSTRY GOVERNMENT COORDINATION BECAUSE INCREASING INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED CYBER THREATS FROM NATION STATES THESE PARTNERSHIPS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER. S. C. WE ARE CONTINUALLY FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING PARTNERSHIPS THE FEDERAL LEVEL AS WELL AS AT THE LOCAL REGIONAL AND STATE LEVELS INCLUDING ENGAGEMENT WITH CALIFORNIA CYBERSECURITY TASK FORCE AND THE FBI CYBER WHO WATCHES. OUR GOAL IS TO ALWAYS HAVE THE TOOLS AND RESOURCES IN PLACE BEFORE MAJOR CYBER ATTACKERS SO IF AND WHEN IT DOES WE CAN FOCUS ON RESPONSE. CUSTOMER PROTECTIONS AND GREATER SECURITY RATHER THAN DEVELOPING THIS PROCESS IS A REAL TIME. TO BE AFFECTED HOWEVER OUR WORK ON THE STRATEGY MUST CONTINUE TO EVOLVE AT A PACE FASTER THAN THE THREATS WE'RE FACING NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE. LASTLY WE MANAGE THE HUMAN SIDE OF RISK BY INVENTING SECURITY DOOR PLEASE STAND. CONSIDERING 80% OF BREACHES ARE CAUSED BY FISHING OR HUMAN ERROR ALL THE TOOLS IN THE WORLD WILL NOT STOP COMPROMISED OR STAFF IS NOT YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO IF THEY RECEIVE A SUSPICIOUS EMAIL. EDISON WE BELIEVE MUST BE INSTINCTIVE AND SECOND NATURE SO WE HAVE A ROBUST AWARENESS PROGRAMS SUPPORT THIS GOAL. FINALLY I WANT TO CLOSE BY STATING THE CONCEPT OF CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT IS THE BEDROCK OF THE CHILI SECTOR BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THE TREMENDOUS RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE ELECTRIC POWER HOMES BUSINESSES. AND OTHER CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THIS IS WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE PARTNER CLOSELY WITH FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES RECOGNIZING ORCHID POWER. IS AN INSTRUMENT OF NATIONAL AND ECONOMIC SECURITY AND THEREFORE WE MUST DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROTECT AGAINST CYBER ADVERSARIES THAT WE WERE SCHOLAR IN WISCONSIN ARE. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU TODAY. I'M A BILL QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR GRANT IT APPEARS THAT WE DON'T HAVE MR SENTHIL LOW OR MR SILVA ON THE LINE SO- JUST WANTED TO MAKE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS I THINK MOST OF YOU EXPRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF- INFORMATION SHARING. AND OF DOING FIX THINGS LIKE SECURITY AND- ASSESSMENTS CERTAINLY WE HAVE A BIG FOCUS IN THE LEGISLATURE ON EDUCATION AND I THINK THAT THAT'S PROBABLY. OUR BIGGEST ROLE- AS A MATTER OF FACT THERE IS MONEY AND THE- BUDGET RIGHT NOW HOPEFULLY THE GOVERNOR WILL BE SIGNING FOR A AND DIGITAL UPSKILLING AND I APPRECIATE- THE IDEA THAT WE REALLY NEED TO START IN THE MIDDLE SCHOOLS. OF WITH- CYBER AWARENESS BUT CERTAINLY- THERE ARE A LOT OF VERY CAPABLE PEOPLE AND OTHER SECTORS THAT MIGHT BENEFIT FROM UPSKILLING PROGRAMMES SO- WILL CONTINUE WE WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THAT BUT I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION FOR- ANYBODY THAT WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER DO YOU AND I THINK THE ANSWER IS PROBABLY NO BUT- DO YOU THINK THAT THERE IS ANY ROLE FOR US. LEGISLATION HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO MAKE SURE THAT UTILITIES ARE AT THE BEST OF CYBER STANCE THAT THEY COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE AT AND LYFT I SEE MISTER GRANT IS- YOU ARE STILL ON THE SCREEN SO MAYBE- MAYBE YOU WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION AND ANYBODY ELSE THAT MIGHT. LIKE TO JUMP IN AFTER THAT. I IT'S IMPORTANT THAT- ANY LEGISLATION STAYS ALIGNED WITH THE FEDERAL LEGISLATION AND- THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE'LL BE LOOKING AT I DON'T I DON'T. THINK THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THEY STILL LACKED RIGHT THAT'S OTHERWISE WITH WE'RE GONNA START TO CREATE MORE NATIONAL BARRIERS. RIGHT THANK IT IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE THAT HAS A COMMENT ON THAT. I WOULD AGREE WITH THIS IS LANCE- I WOULD AGREE WITH WHAT KEVIN DESCRIBED IN JUST MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S YOU KNOW THE ALIGNMENT WITH FEDERAL REGULATIONS STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES JUST TO NOT MAKE IT DUPLICATE IT AND DIFFERENCE. AND THEN THE OTHER THING I WOULD HIGHLIGHT IS THAT YOU KNOW AS THESE THREATS IN IN CYBER RISK HAS INCREASED AS WE'VE ALL DESCRIBED WE BECOME A LOT MORE PROTECTIVE OF OUR DATA AND I THINK I HEARD OF. ME MEMBER CHILD MENTIONED YOU KNOW COMPANIES BEING LEERY ABOUT SHARING DATA. I DON'T THINK IT'S IT WAS NOT IN OUR CASE I DON'T THINK FOR A THE OTHER PANELISTS IT'S THAT WE DON'T WANT TO HEAR THE DATA IT'S WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE DOES THAT DATA GO BECAUSE WE GO TO GREAT LENGTHS TO PROTECT THE INSIDE OF OUR ORGANIZATION. AND SO SUIT WHEN WE'RE ASKED TO SHARE THAT WHICH IS VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE CONTROLS THAT ARE PUT ON THAT DATA ONCE IT LEAVES OUR POSSESSION BECAUSE SOME OF THE DATA IS VERY VERY SENSITIVE FROM AN ATTACKER PERSPECTIVE. AND SO THE QUESTION AROUND WHAT CAN THE STATE LEGISLATIVE- YOU KNOW BODY DO YOU HAVE TO HELP THERE IS YOU KNOW TO MAYBE TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND HELP GUIDE THAT IN IN YOU KNOW- ENGAGING AND YOU KNOW CONTINUING THE ARE THE COLLABORATION PARTNERSHIPS LIKE TIS ONE. TO TALK THROUGH ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO DO THAT TO GET THE INFORMATION TO THE ORGANIZATIONS THE STATE ORGANIZATIONS WITHOUT. WITHOUT HAVING TO NECESSARILY SEND THAT DATA INTO ENVIRONMENTS THAT WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE SECURITY CONTROLS. ARE PROTECTING THAT DATA. THANK YOU IS THERE ARE THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE PANEL BEFORE WE MOVE ON ON THE ON THAT. LEGISLATIVE QUESTION. ALL RIGHT WELL REALLY APPRECIATE ALL OF YOU JOINING US- THIS AFTERNOON AND WE WILL GO ON GO ON AND MOVED TO THE OUR THIRD AND FINAL PANEL. WHICH IS A STATE RESOURCES FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND UTILITIES- WE HAVE JOINING US TODAY TOM OSBORNE WHO IS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF HOMELAND SECURITY WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. JONATHAN NUNEZ THE COMMANDER OF THE CALIFORNIA CYBER. INTEGRATION CENTER. THE TOLLY OF PANACHE. OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE CHIEF INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER VITALI SORRY ABOUT THAT I SHOULD KNOW HOW TO PRONOUNCE YOUR LAST NAME AND RACHEL PETERSON THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE C. P. WANNA THANK ALL OF YOU FOR. JOINING US AND AGAIN WE WILL LISTEN TO YOUR- PREPARED REMARKS AND THEN SEE IF WE HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS SO WHY DON'T WE START WITH MR OSBORNE. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS TOM OSBORNE THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF HOMELAND SECURITY HERE AND BUT ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. ONLY CHEERY DIVISION INCLUDES BOTH THE CALIFORNIA CENTER SECURITY INTEGRATION CENTER OR OUR REFER TO IT AS THE CAL SICK OR THAT THE KELSEY SICK. AS WELL AS OUR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION BRANCH SO THOSE TWO ENTITIES ARE REALLY HELP US ONLINE AND PROTECTING THE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE WHIMS IN CALIFORNIA. AND CERTAINLY THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE IS BIG BRIEFLY TODAY ON THE IMPORTANT WORK THAT A COW SICK IS DOING IN THE FUTURE CHALLENGES THAT WE COLLECTIVELY FACE AND PROTECTING THE STATE'S CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. FROM CYBER INCIDENTS THE CYBER ATTACKS THAT ARE COMING FROM ORGANIZED CRIME GROUPS AS WELL AS STATE SPONSORED- INTRODUCED BY WAY OF BACKGROUND IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. GOVERNOR CALIFORNIA SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER WHICH BASICALLY. CAL SICK IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY EIGHT TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT THIRTEEN. AUTHORED BY NOW CHAIR WHICH CODIFIED IN THE PUT IN THE LAW THAT THE CAL SICK. FROM SUPPORTING CALIFORNIA'S STATEWIDE CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY AND THEN MOST RECENTLY IN FISCAL YEARS TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE GOVERNOR OF THE LEGISLATURE SOMEONE WILL FIND THE CAL SICK BY ALLOCATING ELEVEN POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS OF GENERAL FUND DOLLARS TO FURTHER. ENHANCE OUR SERVERS EFFORTS- HERE IN. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE HEALTH ARE AS A ONE STOP. OF STATE GOT CYBER. ACTIVE IN COURTNEY STARTED IN THIS. RESPONSE AS WELL- I YEAH CRITICAL SERVER TELL WITH STATE LOCAL FEDERAL TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS AS WELL AS OUR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PARTNERS- ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER NON GOVERNMENTAL. AGENCIES SO WHAT I WANT TO TURN OVER TO JONATHAN NUNEZ WHO SERVES AS OUR COMMANDER OF THE CELTIC TO REALLY TALK ABOUT THE THINGS THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY DOING. IT PROTECTING CALIFORNIA'S CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND SOME FUTURE PLANS AND SO JOHNSON. WHICH YOU THANK YOU TOM AND GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON MANAGER AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY. TO SHOW HOW CALIFORNIA- MUST CONSTANTLY ADAPT TO THE EMERGING THREATS IN THE EMERGING CYBERTHREAT LANDSCAPE- AS IT IS INCREASING AT A RAPID PACE HOUSING HERE. WE REALLY DO IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT. CHP THE FBI. AND THE CYBER SECURITY- INFRASTRUCTURE. AND SECURITY NEEDS YOUR SETS UP. BEING REASONABLE RANSOMWARE ATTACK BY SEVERAL. SPREAD OUT- ARE JUST GROWING INCREASE. COMPLEX AND REALLY DEVASTATING OUR COMMUNITIES IF WE LOOK AT YOU KNOW WHAT'S BEEN RECENTLY MENTIONED HERE BY THE PANELISTS. THE COLONIAL PIPELINE IN- JBS- OF THE HOLDS MORE WATER PLAN YOU KNOW HE'S A REALLY IMPACTFUL. TO OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR ECONOMIES. HELLO TO BE ARE NOT AWARE ON MAY EIGHTH COLONIAL ANALYSIS UP RENTS ATTACK. DISCONNECTING IT'S I. T. SYSTEMS- TEMPORARILY STOPPING ALL PIPELINE OPERATIONS THE OUTAGE RESULTED IN ICREASED GAS PRICES ON THE EAST COAST HOWEVER HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE DID NOT SEE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT. TO ADDRESS THIS IN ALL OF THE OTHER INCREASING INCIDENCE OF HOUSING CONTINUES TO WORK. TO ENROLL A HUNDRED AND TWENTY A HUNDRED TWENTY CROSS SECTOR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE ENTITIES WITHIN THE STATE. TO BOLSTER CYBERSECURITY RESILIENCY. OUR SERVICES ARE AIMED AT PRACTICALLY REDUCING IMMINENT CYBER RISK AS WELL AS ADDRESSING SPREAD AWARENESS THROUGH INTELLIGENCE SHARING. AND BY PROVIDING EARLY WARNINGS. DIFICIL TAPE AS THEY CALVET WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH MULTIPLE ENERGY SECTOR PROVIDERS INCLUDING INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES SUCH AS P. G. AND EAT IN FACT ACCOUNTS BECAUSE THEY CAN CAUSE DON'T IN SHIP OF AN OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY LAB OR ELECTRICAL SWITCHING INDUSTRIAL CONTROLS SYSTEM- FROM P. JEANNIE. THE LAB WILL SERVE AS THE FOUNDATION OF A STATEWIDE. ICS INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEM SECURITY ANALYTICS PROGRAM WHICH WOULD GENERATE ICS UP RELATED TRANSFORMATION IN NEAR. REAL TIME TO CRITICAL STAKEHOLDERS. TO SUPPORT THIS IMPROVE WE MADE A COUPLE OF OCT KEY INVESTMENTS TOOLS. ASSEMBLY TO SUPPORT THIS FIRST IS REQUIRED IN INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEM THREAT INTELLIGENCE- DATA SOURCE WHICH WILL INCREASE ACTION ABILITY OF THE INTELLIGENCE WORSENING DOWNS ICS OPERATORS IN THE STATE- HELPING THEM MAKE BETTER FASTER MORE ACCURATE DECISIONS WHEN IT COMES TO CYBER ATTACK IN THE WRITING IS THERE- THE SECOND IS. REAL ESTABLISHED IN A TAX SERVICE MANAGEMENT CAPABILITY WHEREBY WE'RE LOOKING TO NARROW THE APERTURE FOR THOSE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE ALL PARTNERS FOR ATTACKERS LOOKING AT THEIR NO REPORT TO EXPLOIT THEIR NETWORK SO EFFECTIVELY WE WOULD BE BOARD OF FLYING- OUR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PARTNERS AND OR SERVICES IN ADVANCE OF. A SUCCESSFUL INTRUSION ATTEMPTS. SIMILARLY THE HOUSING IS DROPPING A CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENT FOR THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY SECTOR THAT'S NATURAL GAS THAT SPOILED AND THAT'S L. TRICITY. THIS CMA OVER SOME JOURNEY ASSESSMENT WILL OUTLINE THE INDUSTRIES RIGHT AS LINE. AS WELL AS PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS TO COMBAT THOSE VERY SAME CYBER. SOMEONE WILL SAY WILL DRIVE FACTOR HOLDS WITH THE GOAL DRIVING. RISK DOWN IS RISK. UP. ADDITIONALLY THE CAL CONTINUES SIX OUR REACH AID FOR WITH STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENT HELP MINIMIZE IMPACTS AS A RESULT OF CYBERATTACK. THESE MUTUAL AID AGREEMENTS FOR THE COUNTY GIVE NOBODY TO RAPIDLY DEPLOY CYBER RESOURCES WHEREVER IN THE STATE TO AFFECTED ENTITIES. OR THREAT IDENTIFICATION AND DETECTION. LASTLY AS A PROACTIVE MEASURE WE ALSO CONDUCT CONTINUOUS THREAT HUNTING OPERATIONS BASED ON OUR- GLOBAL THREAT INTELLIGENCE AND SPECIALIZED PASSIVE NETWORK TELEMETRY. ARE FRAGMENTING OPERATIONS. ARE AIMED AT IDENTIFYING ADVANCED PERSISTENT THREATS ATTEMPED TO EXPLOIT DISRUPT AND ORGANIX STORE. OUR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PARTNERS AND GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUSINESS OUR WE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THIS A PANEL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND ON TO THE NEXT WE HAVE THE TOLLY PUNISH. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING US TESTIFIED BEFORE YOU GUYS TODAY. MY NAME IS VITALI PENICHE AND I'M THE STATE CHIEF INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER OVERSEEING THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH CONSISTS OF APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED THIRTY PLUS DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS REPORTING TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. SO MY OFFICE. IMPLEMENTS AND FACILITATES SECURITY RISK MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE FOR OUR EXECUTIVE BRANCH PARTNERS WE ARE A WE ARE A DISTRIBUTED DECENTRALIZED ORGANIZATION SO IT'S VITAL AND IMPORTANT TO SET CONSISTENT. STANDARDS GOVERNANCE PRACTICES AND CAPABILITIES OUT OF MY OFFICE. ANOTHER PIECE OF MY OFFICE IS WE IMPLEMENT SECURITY OPERATIONS- PRACTICES SO WE RUN A TWENTY FOUR BY SEVEN SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER. ALONG WITH THAT WE IMPLEMENT AUTOMATION AND NETWORK SECURITY MONITORING FOR OUR ON EXECUTIVE BRANCH ORGANIZATIONS. WITH THE COLLABORATION AND INTEGRATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA CYBER SECURITY INTEGRATION CENTER CALSONIC WILL ALSO EXCHANGE AND COOPERATE WITH THREAT INTELLIGENCE AND INCIDENT RESPONSE. FOR EXAMPLE AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER BY TOM OSBORNE ADMINISTRATION ALONG WITH THE LEGISLATIVE SUPPORT AS FUNDED THE CAL SICK WITH OVER ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS AND THIRTY. THIRTY POSITIONS THIRTY POSITIONS CONSISTING OF OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES STAFF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY A SECURITY ANALYST MILITARY DEPARTMENT AND THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL. SO IT'S A- FEDERATED BUT JOINT- INCIDENT RESPONSE TEAM TO HELP ANALYZE CYBER THREAT INTELLIGENCE PREPARE FOR RESPOND TO AND MITIGATE THREATS TO THE CALIFORNIA CYBER INFRASTRUCTURE. SO WE USE THIS OPPORTUNITY IN THIS TEAM TO HELP SCALE AND HELP SUPPORT THE LTTE'S OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WITH WITHIN OUR STATE. TO DATE WE HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED AS JONATHAN UNIONS MENTIONED TO VARIOUS HUNT TEAM EXERCISES RESPONSE TO RANSOMWARE EVENTS AS WELL AS- HELPING ORGANIZATIONS RECOUP OVER FROM FROM RANSOMWARE THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. SO THAT HAS BEEN A HIGHLY VITAL SUCCESS AND HOW WE MODEL INVESTMENT TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH WHICH WE WILL WHICH WE WHO WE ARE RECOMMENDING TO SCALE AND HELP PREVAIL THESE TYPES OF EFFORTS GOING FORWARD. ADDITIONALLY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY. ALONG WITH THE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES WE FACILITATE- LEVERAGE PROCUREMENTS AND CONTRACTS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH ARE ALSO AVAILABLE TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. INCLUDING MINT MUNICIPAL DISTRICT. SO WE HAVE THE SOFTWARE LICENSING PROGRAM WE HAVE FACILITATED CLOUD CONTRACT SPECIFICALLY CLOUD SECURITY SERVICES AND TOOLS UNDERNEATH OUR OUR STATE PROCUREMENT VEHICLES. WE ALSO FACILITATE INDEPENDENT SECURITY ASSESSMENTS WITH THE PARK PARTNERSHIP OF THE CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT THEN THAT IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE WHICH I WOULD RECOMMEND TO SCALE AND EXTENT TO THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. SO WE LEVERAGE THE INDEPENDENT SECURITY ASSESSMENTS VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS AND PENETRATION TEST. THAT THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT PROVIDES FOR OUR STATE DEPARTMENT SO THAT KINDA SUCKS THAT'S US IN OBJECTIVE. STANCE THAT WE COULD THAT WE COULD MEASURE THE MATURITY OF OUR STATE ORGANIZATIONS AND THEN MAP MAP IT TO THE NEXT CASF IN THIS STATE HUNDRED SERIES FRAMEWORKS SO THAT'S KIND OF THE ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM TO A BASELINE THAT WE LEVERAGE. ALSO UNDERNEATH OUR STATE PROCUREMENT CONTRACTING NOW WE HAVE APPLICATION SERVICES TESTING BE ONBOARDED IN POINT PROTECTION PLATFORMS AND EDR ENDPOINT DETECTION AND RESPONSE. AWARENESS OF SWEETS AND ANTI PHISHING TRAINING SERVICES AS PART OF OUR CONTRACTING VEHICLES THOSE ARE I MIGHT ADD AGAIN HAND EMPHASIZED THAT THEY THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO OUR LOCAL SECTOR PARTNERS AS WELL. SO WE WILL CONTINUE DOING WORK IN NYC ON THE CONTRACTUAL VEHICLE SIDE AS WELL. DURING THE MONTH OF OCTOBER THIS EDTA ALONG WITH THE PARTNERSHIP WITH CELTIC WE HOST THE ANNUAL CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION SUMMIT WHICH IS ALSO OPEN TO THE ACADEMIC SECTOR INCLUDING MIDDLE SCHOOLS AND HIGH SCHOOLS. IT'S ALSO OPEN TO PRIVATE PRIVATE SECTOR AS WELL SO WE USED AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO FACILITATE AN INDUSTRY CONVENING IF YOU WELL SIMILAR TO THE NATURE OF THIS CONVENING SO THIS IS ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY THAT I WOULD ENCOURAGE LOCAL STILL HEAVILY PARTICIPATE AND- AS I MENTIONED- MY OFFICE OFFICE OF INFORMATION SECURITY WE- WE SIT WITHIN THE STATE WIDE DATA CENTER. BABY THE STATE BY DATA CENTER RUNS AND MAINTAINS. THE CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT ENTERPRISE NETWORK WHICH PROVIDES. CONNECTIVITY TO OUR A LOOK TO OUR STATE LEVEL ORGANIZATIONS BUT ALSO WE DO SERVE ASK CUSTOMERS TO. VARIOUS LOCAL COUNTIES AND CITIES AND MISS MUNICIPALITIES. THREE THROUGH THE C. CHEN THE CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT ENTERPRISE NETWORK THIS IS WHERE WE IN BED ARE TWENTY FOUR BY SEVEN SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER PRACTICE. SO LEVERAGING SUCH DATA CENTER SERVICES WILL AID AND BENEFIT THE- SECURITY MINUTE MITIGATION PRACTICES OR SECURITY MITIGATIONS FOR OUR L. LTT PARTNERS AS WELL. I MIGHT ADD TO THAT WE DO LEVERAGE AND INTEGRATE THAT STATEWIDE DATA CENTERS WELL AS THE NETWORK WITH THE MS ISAC AS MENTIONED BY RANDY ROSE EARLIER. THROUGHOUT FOCAL POINT WE EXCHANGE THREAT INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION WITH THE DENNIS I SECOND BENEFIT FROM FROM A LOT OF REALLY GREAT SERVICES THERE AS WELL. SO DEFINITELY WOULD ENCOURAGE THE LTTE COMMUNITY TO PARK PARTNER WITH CDT ON ON THAT FRONT AS IT IS A CONDUIT AND FOCAL POINT. TO THE WONDERFUL SERVICES MS ISAC PROVIDES. AS I MENTIONED. WE DO CREATE A POLICY AND GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK AVAILABLE TO OUR STATE ORGANIZATIONS. WE PROVIDE PACKAGED AND- CONCISE SECURITY STANDARDS PROCEDURES AND POLICIES. FOR OUR CUSTOMER BASE AND THAT IS SOMETHING WE ARE WILLING AND ABLE TO SHARE- PRIMARILY THROUGH OUR OUTREACH WITH THE CALIFORNIA COUNTIES. INFORMATION SERVICES DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND MUNICIPAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS. CALIFORNIA WHICH WE HAVE DONE OUTREACH THROUGH ON IN THROUGHOUT THE COURSE. COURSE OF THE LAST YEAR SO I WOULD DEFINITELY ENCOURAGE AND RECOMMEND TO REACH OUT. TO MY OFFICE AND CAL SICK THE TO EXPLORE FURTHER- COLLABORATION EFFORTS ON THESE FRONTS. AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THIS PANEL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THEN FOR OUR LAST SPEAKER ON THE LAST PANEL WE HAVE RACHEL UP PETERSON. GOOD AFTERNOON- CHAIR OR WON AN HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY NAME IS RACHEL PETERSON. I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. FIFTY PC REGULATES THE PRIVATELY OWNED ELECTRIC GAS WATER TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPORTATION UTILITIES IN CALIFORNIA. WITH THE AIM OF ENSURING THAT THEY DELIVER SAFE RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE SERVICES OF DAILY LIFE HE CALIFORNIANS. THIS INCLUDES ENSURING THAT THE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE OPERATED BY THE UTILITY. IS PROTECTED FROM CYBER SECURITY THREATS. THANK YOU FOR INVITING THE C. P. C. TO JOIN THE PANEL I'M VERY GLAD TO BE HERE WITH MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY- ALL THROUGHOUT THE PANELS TODAY YOU. I FELT THAT THE PALETTE AND REALLY LAID OUT WELL THE CYBER SECURITY THREATS THAT THE WORLD FACES TODAY. WHICH OF COURSE ARE ONLY GROWING IN COMPLEXITY AND SCALE. ON THE BASIS OF OBSERVING THOSE EXPERIENCES I AT THE TPC WE ARE ACUTELY AWARE OF THE IMPACT. THAT A CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE CYBER ATTACKS CAN HAVE ON PEOPLE DAVID BY. TODAY I WANT TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW WE USE THE PC HAVE BEEN WORKING ON CYBERSECURITY AS AN EMERGING THREAT FOR UTILITIES. FOR ABOUT A DECADE. AND TOUCH ON THE FRAMING QUESTIONS THAT YOU POSE TO OUR PANEL. OVERALL WE PURSUED A THREE PRONGED APPROACH CHURCH THAT FOSTERING POLICY EXPERTISE. SECOND USING THAT POLICY EXPERTISE TO BUILD OUR UTILITY REGULATORY FRAMEWORK AND THIRD SERVING IN A SUPPORTING AND PARTNER ROLE TO CAL- YES AND TO WORK WITH YOUR AGENCIES DURING CYBER INCIDENT AND DURING STEADY STATE OPERATION. FIRST AS TO FOSTERING POLICY EXPERTISE IN TWENTY TWELVE THE CPUC PUBLISHED A POLICY PAPER THAT RECOGNIZED SORRY SIDE WITH THE KERRY AT THE THEORY OF THE EMERGING THREATS FOR UTILITIES. THE PAPER ADDRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STANDARDS FOR CYBERSECURITY REGULATIONS SPECIFICALLY THE NORTH AMERICAN ELECTRIC A LOT RELIABILITY CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND- CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION REQUIREMENT OR NURKIC. OF INTEREST I THINK TO THIS COMMITTEE IN OUR PAPER WE NOTICED WE NOTED THAT NURKIC SHIP REQUIREMENTS ARE PRIMARILY A COMPLIANCE BASED POLICY COMPLIANCE IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF ADDRESSING CYBERSECURITY BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH AS YOU HEARD FROM OTHER PANELISTS TODAY TO ENSURE THAT THE RAPIDLY EVOLVING CYBER RISKS ARE ADEQUATELY CONSIDERED AND ACTED UPON EFFECTIVELY. THEREFORE WE RECOMMENDED A RISK MANAGEMENT AND RISK ASSESSMENT BEACH BASED APPROACH FOR UTILITIES AND REALLY WERE LOOKING TO SERVE TWO PURPOSES FIRST MAXIMIZE THE RESPONSIVENESS TO CHANGING THREATS AND SECOND WORK OVERALL TOWARD A CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEM THAT IS DESIGNED TO BE RESILIENT. FOLLOWING THAT PAPER. AND. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE BBC INSTITUTED A RISK ASSESSMENT AND RISK MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR ELECTRIC AND GAS UTILITIES AND THE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THEY OPERATE. IT'S GOING TO ONE OF YOUR TRAINING QUESTIONS ABOUT INCENTIVIZING ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE NEED FOR PRIVATE UTILITY TREND THAT THE INTEGRITY CARRIED THE TO MAINTAIN RELIABLE SERVICES. THE ANSWER IS VERY MUCH YET. BEFORE EACH UTILITY BEGAN ITS BUDGET KATIE CORA WHICH THEY BRING TO US EVERY FOUR YEARS THOSE ARE CALLED THE GENERAL RATE CASES AND WE ACTUALLY REQUIRE THEM TO PRESENT A RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION SAY TO US STARTING WELL IN ADVANCE OF THEIR- PRIMARY BUDGET KATE. DURING THAT PHASE THE UTILITY MUST IDENTIFY RISK ESTIMATE PROBABLY PROBABILITIES AND CONSEQUENCES OF THOSE TRIPS. AND PROPOSED FUNDING FOR THE PACIFIC MEDICATION. THIS INCLUDES CYBERSECURITY BRETT. OUR TEAM THEN EITHER ARE YOU WAIT THE UTILITIES RISK ASSESSMENT AND PROPOSED MITIGATION. AND THOSE THAT EVALUATION FORMS PART OF THE PROCESS OF DELIBERATING ON THE UTILITIES PROPOSAL IN THEIR PROJECTS. NEXT I'LL TURN TO OUR GOVERNMENT PARTNERSHIPS AND OUR UTILITY REGULATORY FRAMEWORK BEYOND THAT BUDGET CASE. IN OUR GOVERNMENT PARTNERSHIPS WE ARE IN ACTIVE COMMUNICATION AND COORDINATION WITH CAL- YEAH. FIFTY P. THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY'S OFFICE OF CYBERSECURITY ENERGY SECURITY AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE. AS WELL AS THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REGULATORY COMMISSIONS ARE NEIGHBORS AND OTHER STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES. WE EQUALLY VIEW THAT LEVEL OF COORDINATION AND PARTNERSHIP- EXCEEDINGLY IMPORTANT IN THE THREE NOT AT- MY CO PANELISTS POINTED OUT. THEN WITH RESPECT TO THE UTILITIES THAT ARE UNDER OUR JURISDICTION WE ARE MONITORING- THEIR CYBERSECURITY SAFEGUARDS AND BOLSTERING THEIR OVERALL RESILIENCY TO CYBER ATTACKS. SOME OF THE PRIMARY AREAS OF CONCERN THAT WE HAVE GOT- RIGHT NOW INCLUDE HUMAN ERRORS THAT YOU COURAGE AS WELL AS THE GROWING ATTACK SURFACE WHICH IS A RISK THAT IS EXPANDED AS WE- HAVE CONTINUE TO DEPLOY NETWORK AND FIBER ENABLED AND OPERATED DISTRIBUTED ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES. ANOTHER EMERGING CONCERN ARE THE CYBER PHYSICAL SYSTEMS THAT HAVE BLURRED THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN PHYSICAL SECURITY AND CYBERSECURITY. SO THIS ALSO GO TO ONE OF YOUR FRAMING QUESTIONS ABOUT RESOURCES BEING OFFERED TO UTILITIES- THAT PROVIDE THESE ESSENTIAL SERVICES TO CALIFORNIA. DURING CYBER INCIDENTS THE- AND THAT TYPE WITH THE KERRY TEAM WITHIN THE CPC ACTIVELY COORDINATES AND COLLABORATES WITH CAL- OH YESS CAL THANK. YOU SERVE IN A SUPPORT ROLE THERE AND TO THAT END WE ARE CREDENTIALED CYBER SECURITY STAFF PROVIDE DIRECT SUPPORT AS REQUESTED BY CELTIC- WE LOOK TO PROVIDE INDUSTRY SPECIFIC INSIGHT AND ENSURE THAT CELTIC RECEIVES THE NECESSARY INFORMATION. FROM THE UTILITIES UNDER OUR REGULATION TO ADDRESS THAT FIBER INCIDENTS. WE PLAYED THAT THE COURT WELL RECENTLY DURING SOLAR WHEN THE MICROSOFT EXCHANGE ATTACK AND. THE COLONIAL PIPELINE. AND ANOTHER YOUR PRINTING QUESTION YES OUR DO OTHER ALL FIVE MINUTES FRAMEWORK FUNCTION IDENTIFY PROTECT DETECT RESPOND AND RECOVER. AGAIN THE UTILITIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSESSING THEIR RISK IN THOSE FIVE AREAS AND PRIORITIZING ACTIONS TO MITIGATE THOSE RISKS. BUT WE USE THAT SAME FRAMEWORK IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THEIR CAPABILITY. INCLUDING THE CITY STATE IS HERE TO WORK AT PARTNERED WITH CALORIE S. B. E. T. THIS COMMITTEE THE LEGISLATURE TO ADDRESS THE KEY CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE FACING- BOTH AS STATE REGULATORS OF ESSENTIAL SERVICES. AND THAT'S PARTNER STATE PARTNERS AND IT'S IMPORTANT AFTER THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN FOR THE CHANCE TO APPEAR AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISS PETERSON AND- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HEARD FROM THE- UTILITIES AND ESPECIALLY THE SMALL WATER DISTRICT IS- THE LACK OF FUNDING AND SO I WAS WONDERING WHETHER YOU COULD ANSWER OR- ANY OF OUR OTHER THREE PANELISTS MAYBE TALK ABOUT- APPLICABLES GRANTS OR FUNDING STREAMS TO SHARE WITH. A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OR UTILITIES FOR CYBER SECURITY PURPOSES AND I ASSUME THAT THAT WOULD REALLY BE. TOM. I WAS SET UP THEIR FIRST SECOND YEAH THERE'S DIFFERENT DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES TO THAT HOME IS PRETTY GRANT PROGRAM WE DON'T INCREASING CYBERSECURITY AND RESILIENCE OP THAT MONEY SLOW DOWN THROUGH THE FENCE AND SO TO THAT END- DIFFERENT GRANTS CAN BE MADE AVAILABLE TO HELP. AND LOCAL STATE GOVERNMENT SOCKET IS THERE IS ONE AVENUE AS WELL AS IN ROLLING. INTO VARIOUS DIFFERENT PLATFORMS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE- TODAY THAT IS THAT LITTLE CHU CHU NO COST SO MUCH- IS A SIMPLE AS REACHING OUT TO US AND WE CAN WORK- WHATEVER AGENCY YOU MAY WANT YOU OUT PARTNER UP WITH US. ARE ARE YOU DOING ANY OF A PROACTIVE REACHING OUT TO THESE SMALLER UTILITIES TO LET THEM KNOW OR OR DO THEY REALLY NEED TO- TAKE THE INITIATIVE ON THAT. BOTH TO BE HONEST IS THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU ARE CRITICAL OF THE STRUCTURE- PROTECTION PROGRAM THEY MAINTAINING YOU KNOW THE RELATIONSHIPS THERE YOU KNOW ON THE GROUND. I'M FROM A PHYSICAL ASPECT AND NOW I'M SEEING NOW WITH THE SAME SECURITY ASPECTS SO THAT IS ONE- AVENUE. OF APPROACH AND IN DIALOGUE EXISTS THERE IF YOU ARE GRANT FUNDING GROUP WHO HAVE- CONTACTS WITH THE COUNTIES- IS ANOTHER WAY ANOTHER AVENUE FOR RICH PEOPLE CAN CONNECT. IN THAT REGARD SO IT REALLY IS IN BOTH WAYS. OKAY AND THEN THE- I'M I'M NOT SURE I ASSUME YOU CAN ANSWER THIS TO WHAT IT WHAT COORDINATION OR OR- ONE OF THE STATE FOLKS. WHAT IS THE- YOUR WHAT IS YOUR COORDINATION LEVEL WITH THE CYBERSECURITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE. SECURITY AGENCY. YEAH I'LL START. YOU KNOW JOHN THINKING ADD OR EVEN MENTALITY BUT THIS MOST RECENTLY- WE NOW HAVE BEEN IN BAD WITH US SINCE OUR STATE TIME ANALYST SO. THIS PERSON- IS BASICALLY SITTING WITH US TO BETTER CONNECTS- WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS ON CYBER THREAT INTELLIGENCE INCIDENT RESPONSE AND ALL THE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN BRING TO. HELP MITIGATE THE SPREAD SO GREAT STRIDES IN SYSTEM AND ADDING THE- RESOURCES TO. BE EMBEDDED WITH WHAT THE CAL SIX. DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER. COMMENTS ON THAT ISSUE. NO NO I GO WHAT WHAT TIME IS MENTIONED I WILL EXPLORE THAT WE AREN'T EARLY CONVERSATIONS WITH SYSTEM AROUND ESTABLISHING INCIDENT RESPONSE SUPPORT. SIMPLY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO WE CONTINUE THAT DIALOGUE AS WELL. THANK YOU AND I REALLY WANT TO THINK OF IF EVERYBODY THAT JOINED US TODAY ON ALL THREE OF THE PANELS AND UP.
