THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND LET ME FIRST EXCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS LISTED IN COMMENT FIVE A OF THE ANALYSIS. A BE. FIFTEEN FORTY SEVEN MODIFIES THE DEFINITION OF SMALL BUSINESSES UNDER THE CALIFORNIA AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT SMALL BUSINESS CAPITAL ACCESS LOAN. PROGRAM FOR THE PURPOSE OF INCREASING THE NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS AND I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE WORD INCREASE ENOUGH WE IN NO WAY WANT TO CHANGE IT TO. TOO HIGH HAVE LESS PARTICIPATION THIS IS TO ADD THE PARTICIPATION AND TWENTY FIFTEEN THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED AND PROVIDED TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR A NEW LOSS RESERVE PROGRAM TO ASSIST SMALL BUSINESSES. AND ACCESSING CAPITAL TO MAKE THE NECESSARY CHANGES TO ME ES DE A REQUIREMENTS AND AS WE KNOW MANY OF US FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THIS HAS BEEN QUITE. DIFFICULT FOR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS TIED TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE CREATING SPACES FOR. ADA. CONFORMITY. UNFORTUNATELY TODAY NO LOANS HAVE RESULTED FROM THE PROGRAM THE STAFF OF THE CALIFORNIA POLLUTION. CONTROL FINANCING AUTHORITY HAVE RECOMMENDED THE CHANGES IN THIS BILL WITH ME TODAY IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR I AT FROM THE FINANCING AUTHORITY AND I'M GONNA LET HER GO AHEAD AND INTRODUCE YOURSELF TO MAKE SOME SHORT COMMENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRK SILVA HAPPY TO BE HERE TODAY IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. OF CDC FAA WINNINGS WERE NAY WEBSTER HAWKINS. WE HAVE BEEN OPERATING A CAL CAP PROGRAM WHICH IS A LOAN LOSS RESERVE A CREDIT ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM FOR SMALL BUSINESSES SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR. PRIOR TO THAT WE'VE ALSO BEEN PROVIDING. LOWER COST TO ACCESS TO CAPITAL THROUGH OUR BOND PROGRAM FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. SO WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY IN UNDERSTANDING ON BOTH WHAT SMALL BUSINESSES NEED. TO ACCESS CAPITAL BUT AS WELL. EQUALLY IMPORTANT WHAT LENDERS NEED. TED TO HELP THEM MAKING THOSE LOANS ESPECIALLY IN. UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC TIMES OR WITH UNCERTAIN. AT BUSINESS ACTIVITIES ARE PROPOSED TO BE SUPPORTED BY THE LOANS WE WERE THRILLED. ED TO TO SUPPORT ASSEMBLYMEMBER GOMEZ'S VISION OF A SPECIAL PROGRAM TO USE ASSIST SMALL BUSINESSES TO INCREASE THEIR ACCESS. TO AYE DISABLED CALIFORNIANS. A IT YOU'RE PROBABLY AWARE THAT THAT CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON DISABILITY ACCESS. AGGREGATES. A LOT OF DATA ABOUT THE ACCESSIBILITY OF BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA AND THE LACK THERE OF TWO OR CALIFORNIANS WITH DISABILITIES AND A LOT OF TIMES IT HAS TO DO WITH. MINOR IMPROVEMENTS TO PARKING. TWO ENTRANCES AND EXITS. AND OTHER. OUT ASPECTS OF THEIR SMALL BUSINESS. AND SO THIS PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED WITH. THAT DIVISION OF MAKING IT EASIER FOR THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES TO TO OPEN THEIR DOORS. BOTH FIGURATIVELY AND PHYSICALLY TO DO IT CALIFORNIANS WITH DISABILITIES I'M RECOGNIZING THAT THERE IS A LOT OF. INCOME THAT THOSE HAVE BUSINESSES COULD BE GENERATING IF IF THEY BOTH. IF THERE WERE MORE ACCESSIBLE. AS THE ASSEMBLYMEMBER. AND CHAIR NOTED WE HAVE CURRENTLY NOT TO YET. YET YET TO MAKE ANY LOANS UNDER THE PROGRAM WE HAVE BEEN. WE. DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED THE REGULATIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM WE'VE BEEN WORKING ACTIVELY AND OUTREACH THROUGHOUT THE STATE ALSO TOGETHER WITH GOBIZ. ATTENDING A REGION'S FAR AND WIDE IN ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS AND AND TALKING WITH BUSINESSES WITH ADVOCATES AND WITH LOCAL PLANNERS AND BUILDING OFFICIALS. AND. AND WHAT WHAT REMAINS TRUE IS THAT THIS PROGRAM. BEAN ORIGINALLY HAVE FOCUSED ON THE TRUE MICRO BUSINESSES. OUT MAY HAVE BEEN CAST A TOO NARROW WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT OUR EXPERTISE AND EXPERIENCE IN ADMINISTERING THE REGULAR CAL CAP PROGRAMS THERE THE-DEFINITION OF SMALL BUSINESS ALIGNS WITH THE FEDERAL DEFINITION WHICH IS FIVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES OR LESS. AND MOST OF OUR LOANS ARE TO MICRO BUSINESSES AND AND THE SAME IS TRUE IN ANOTHER PROGRAM WE RUN ON BEHALF OF A ARE BE FOR. FOR HEAVY DUTY TRUCK UPGRADES AND. AND SO WE BELIEVE THROUGH THIS AMENDMENT. THAT WE CAN. INCREASE THE NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE BUSINESSES. MAKE THE LENDERS MORE COMFORTABLE BY BEING ABLE TO HAVE A MORE DIVERSE PORTFOLIO WITH A FEW LARGER BUSINESSES BUT STILL TRULY TARGET THE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE MOST IN NEED OF THIS PROGRAM SO. THAT WE. AS AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR I'M I'M VERY HAPPY ABOUT THESE AMENDMENTS TO AB FIFTEEN FORTY SEVEN I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO CONVENE MY MULTI MEMBER BOARD YET SINCE THE MEMBER AMENDMENTS WERE INTRODUCED. ON BUT I'M GONNA BE RECOMMENDING THAT THEY FULLY SUPPORT OF THIS LANGUAGE AND HAPPY TO WORK WITH ALL OF YOU TO TO MAKE THIS PROGRAM SUCCESS. THINK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. EVELYN I WILL HASN'T WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA WERE ACROSS DISABILITY ORGANIZATION WE REALLY THINK THAT THIS IS A BILL THAT'S GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

AND THANK YOU MEMBER SAYS AB NINE SIX TWO ITEM TO. THE BILL I'M ESTABLISHES A PROCESS BY WHICH HARBOR AGENCIES WHICH A PREDOMINATELY R. EXCLUSIVELY PUBLIC ENTITIES. THAT THEY CAN HELP TO MONETIZE THE VALUE. OF THE AYE AND NEW FACILITY NEW EQUIPMENT OR A PROCESS. SO THAT. PREMISE OF THIS IS THAT OUR PORTS HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB. THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND OTHERS HAVE SAID THEY'VE DONE A GOOD JOB AND. REDUCING THEIR EMISSIONS AND ADOPTING. IMPORTANT UP. AROUND CLIMATE CHANGE HOWEVER THOSE POLICIES HAVE COST. AND THEREFORE THE PORTS ARE NOT CURRENTLY IN THE POSITION TO GO AND DO FURTHER. EXPENDITURES. UNDER THIS PROCESS IT WOULD ALLOW THE STATE. TO REVIEW WHAT FACILITY OR EQUIPMENT. PURCHASE WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. THEY WOULD EVALUATE THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THAT TO THE STATE THEY'D BE LOOKING AT JOBS SALES TAX BY BOTH STATE AND LOCAL. LOS WE LOOKING AT HEALTH BENEFITS. THESE ANALYSES HAVE TO BE DONE UNDER SOUND ECONOMIC PRINCIPLES REVIEWED UNDER A THIRD PARTY. AND THAT. COST BENEFIT TO THE STATE OVER OVER TIME WILL THAT INFORMATION BE PRESENTED TO THE CALIFORNIA INFRASTRUCTURE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BANK. THE BANQUET REVIEW THAT CONFIRM THAT THE WORK WAS DONE PROPERLY. AND UNDER THE AMENDMENTS AT THE COMMITTEE I'M IS BEING ASKED TO ADOPT THAT THEY WOULD THEN ADOPT A RESOLUTION THAT WOULD EITHER BE. THE LESSER OF. SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE FUTURE VALUE OF DOING THE NEW WEEK INSTALLING THE NEW EQUIPMENT. OR FIFTY PERCENT OF THE COST OF THE EQUIPMENT. THE I. BANK WOULD THEN SUBMIT THAT INFORMATION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHO WOULD INCLUDE THAT AS A PROPOSED APPROPRIATION. WITH THE N. EITHER THE GOVERNOR'S. PROPOSED BUDGET OR UNDER BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL THAT WOULD ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO ALSO WAY AND AND I'VE WE WOULD OF COURSE ALSO BE LOOKING AT THE SAME INFORMATION. ALRIGHT WE HAVE OUR AUTHOR JOINING US HOPE YOUR BILL WAS JUST VERY ELOQUENTLY DESCRIBED BY A CONSULTANT SO IF YOU HAVE ANY. OTHER REMARKS THAT YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD MORNING I'M HERE SAID EIGHTY NINE SIXTY TWO WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO DIVERSIFY THE FINANCING PORTFOLIO FOR CALIFORNIA'S PORTS. FIRST MR BY THANKING THE CHAIRWOMAN ENTER STAFF FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THIS BILL ARE NOT JUST THIS YEAR BUT TO AS WE'VE BEEN MOVING FORWARD. I'M TAKING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WE'VE WORKED ON THE PAST COUPLE WEEKS. SO INTERNATIONAL TRADE IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF OUR NATION'S ECONOMY AND CALIFORNIA'S PORTS PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN SERVING OUR NATION'S TRADE NEEDS. FORTY PERCENT OF THE TOTAL CONTAINERIZED CARGO ENTERING THE UNITED STATES ARRIVED CALIFORNIA PORTS AND WAS THIRTY PERCENT OF THE NATION'S EXPORTS FLOW THROUGH CALIFORNIA'S WELL. TRADE IS A MAJOR DRIVER CALIFORNIA CONTRIBUTE NO WAS TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF OUR STATE'S ECONOMY. PORT ACTIVITIES ALSO EMPLOY MORE THAN HALF A MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA AND GENERATE AN ESTIMATED NINE BILLION DOLLARS IN STATE AND LOCAL REVENUE. ANNUALLY IS NOT TO MENTION ALL THE ECONOMIC EFFECT ALL OF THESE JOBS. CALIFORNIA'S HOME TO ONE OF THE MOST PRODUCTIVE SYSTEMS OF PORTS IN THE NATION INCLUDING THREE OF AMERICA'S LARGE CONTAINER PORTS. AND A DIVERSE SYSTEM OF SMALLER PORTS AS WELL. SO WITH THAT EIGHTY NINE SIXTY TWO IS AN INNOVATIVE WAY FOR CALIFORNIA TO SUPPORTER HERE INTERNATIONAL TRADE ECONOMY. AND TO ENSURE THAT OUR PORCH REMAIN COMPETITIVE WITH OTHER PORTS NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY. I THE WAKE OF THE ELIMINATION OF REDEVELOPMENT AND OTHER ECONOMIC TOÃºN TOOLS IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. I CALIFORNIA HAD REVAMPED ITS PUBLIC FINANCING TOOLS PROVIDE FOR ENHANCE INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICTS ALSO KNOWN AS E. AYE FTC'S. AND ON THE HEELS OF THE SUCCESSFUL EFFORT OF AB SIXTY THREE BY SENATOR ISIDORE HALL IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. I WHICH ALSO CREE NEITHER FOR REPORT FINANCING OPPORTUNITIES. SO IN SHORT EIGHTY NINE SIX TWO IS GOING TO CREATE A NEW PUBLIC FINANCING PROGRAM TO ENCOURAGE FUTURE INVESTMENTS IN OUR POOR INFRASTRUCTURE. FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA TO BE MISTREAT ADMINISTRATED BY STATE INFRASTRUCTURE BANK AD I BELIEVE IT ANDREW. ADD TO IT WITH THE. PMSA IS ALREADY SPOKEN SO WITH THAT NO ANDREAS NOT ALWAYS NOT. WE MY CONSULTANT WHERE XANDER. XANDER HERE. A MEASURE OR GET OUT YOUR JUST WAITING TO SPEAK BUT YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN. WILL I STAND CORRECTED TOYS ALREADY THIS MORNING SO I HAVE AND YOU'RE WITH THE FOR PMSA. AND HE WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU EVEN MORE. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER ALLEN I DON'T HAVE MUCH TO ADD KNOWS BEEN WELL LAID OUT I JUST WANT TO. POINT TO THE FACT THAT* A PROG A BROUGHT THIS PROPOSAL FOR IT AND TWENTY SIXTEEN WE THINK IT'S A EXCELLENT IDEA WE ARE PUTTING SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CHECKS AND BALANCES. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE VALUATION WHICH REALLY SETS THE AMOUNT OF THE APPROPRIATION AS GOVERNED BY THE COMMITTEE'S AMENDMENT. AND WE'RE HAPPY TO DISCUSS THE AMENDMENT IN THIS COMMITTEE BUT A WAIT UNTIL ADOPTION AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE. GIVEN THE. DEADLINES THAT WERE FACING FOR THIS BILL TO MOVE THROUGH WITH. IN THE LEGISLATIVE CALENDAR. WE THINK THAT THE STATE HAS SAID SOME VERY AGGRESSIVE GOALS WHEN IT COMES TO GRAINY EQUIPMENT AT THE PORTS. BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PRESERVE COMPETITIVENESS. WE ARE SEEING OTHER STATES ACTUALLY INVEST IN THE REPORTED FOR STRUCTURE. WITH THE WITHOUT THE LEVEL OF CLEANLINESS THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IN THAT WE SHOULD BE HAVING ON PORT EQUIPMENT IN THE STATE. AND SO HAVING A WAY TO DEVELOP A WIN WIN. AND PRESERVE THE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES AND THE JOBS THESE ARE GOOD PAYING JOBS FAMILY SUPPORTING THE NECESSARILY NEED A COLLEGE DEGREE. AND THIS IS THE LAST BIG SECTOR IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA STATEWIDE WHETHER BE AGRICULTURE A RETAIL. AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE SUPPORT. THE COMMITTEES SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS ON THE BILL AND WE ASK FOR GUY VOTE. THANK YOU UP MEMBERS ANY COMMENTS. AND GUY MOTION MOVE. SECOND AND DO WE HAVE ANY SUPPORT COMMENTS FROM OUR GUESTS. ANY OPPOSITION. ANY CLOSING REMARKS VERY SIMPLY CALIFORNIA'S PORTS ARE THE BEST IN THE NATION ABOUT WHAT THIS WILL ALLOW US TO DO IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MAKING THE NEED TO INVEST IN THESE PORTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE REMAIN COMPETITIVE. BUSINESS THAT IS NOT GOING CALIFORNIA IT'S VERY EASY FOR TO OTHER STATES THE NORTH OF US THREE Z. FOR MEXICO TO TAKE IT TO THE SOUTH OF US. AND THEN WE'RE ALSO SEEING ENHANCED ACTIVITY FROM THE EASTERN SEABOARD PORTS. THERE'S A LOT OF OPTIONS IN TODAY'S GLOBAL ECONOMY CALIFORNIA HOUSE TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR PORCH MEAN COMPETITIVE THIS WILL ALLOW THEM THE FINANCING THEY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS THIS IS ABSOLUTELY. IS VITAL FOR OUR STATE'S ECONOMY IT'S VITAL FOR THE THIS THE ECONOMY OF THE UNITED STATES BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF THIS BUSINESS COMES TO CALIFORNIA'S LET'S MAKE THE NEED INVESTMENT AND LET'S GET THIS. THANK YOU I'M JUST GONNA ASK YOU TO KIND OF GIVE A SCENARIO OR AN EXAMPLE TO SOME OF OUR VIEWERS WHO MAY NOT BE AS INVOLVED WITH. I BANK AND FINANCING WHAT WOULD THIS LOOK LIKE FOR. OF BUSINESS SOMEBODY WANTING TO DO BUSINESS AT OUR PORTS JUST GIVE US AN EXAMPLE OF ABSOLUTE ONE VENDOR IF YOU WANT TO TAKE YOU OUT OF CHAIR STRESSED AS. A MARINE TERMINAL OPERATOR THE PORTS ARE THEIR LANDLORDS. BUT THE ACTUAL. MOVEMENT OF THE CARGO ARE HANDLED BY PRIVATE. COMPANIES THAT ARE THE LEASE TENETS OF THE PORCH SO FOR LEASE TENANTS SAY SSA MARINE. I WANTED TO COME FORWARD AND BILL. OR INSTALL A PIECE OF INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE OF A CARGO HANDLER EQUIPMENT OR QUITE A CRANE THAT CURRENTLY OPERATES UNDER DIESEL. AND WANTED TO MOVE TO SAY AND ELECTRIFIED CREE. BUT THE COST OF THAT. WAS MORE THAN THE POOR COULD JUSTIFY AND THE TENANT BASED ON THE CURRENT ECONOMICS OF THE PRICE OF MOVING CARGO AND THE TARIFF RATES THAT THEY CURRENTLY CHARGE. BUT THEY WANTED TO DO IT THERE WAS A GOAL SET BY THE STATE AND FRANKLY THAT THE PORT AND THE REGIONAL AIR DISTRICT. BUT THAT DIESEL CRANE COULD WORK FOR YEARS. AND HAD ALREADY BEEN PAID FOR IN THE ECONOMIC MODEL THAT EXISTED. THIS WOULD ALLOW THE PORT TO COME FORWARD GET EVALUATION HAVE THE EVALUATION VERIFIED BY THE INFRASTRUCTURE BANK. HAVE AN INDEPENDENT CONSULTANT REVIEW IT. HAVE THE PORT MAKE A RESOLUTION AND A FINDING THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE HIDE LANDS ACT. AND THEN BASED ON A FUTURE APPROPRIATION BY THE LEGISLATURE. AS CONFIRMED BY THE CURRENT FINANCE. THE WAR ERA AND APPROPRIATIONS BASED ON EVALUATION. SO THERE'S YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A SEVERAL CHECKS IN THE PROCESS. I JUST ASKED THAT QUESTION BECAUSE IN THIS COMMITTEE WE HEAR LOTS OF TERMINOLOGY AND I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT OUR VIEWERS BECAUSE I KNOW WE HAVE SO MANY OUT THERE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ARE FOLLOWING ALONG WITH US AND. UNDERSTANDING HOW THESE INVESTMENTS. I CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE NOT ONLY IN OUR ENVIRONMENT BUT ALSO IN OUR AND BECAUSE THEY ARE IN OUR ECONOMY. YEAH SO IT MANAGER RIGHT I BUT THAT INTO PLAIN ENGLISH TO FRAME IT HAPPENS TO BE VIEWING OR ANY MEDIA THAT'S COVERING US. VERY SIMPLY OUR PORTS PAIN CONSTANT INVESTMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE BEST PORTS IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY THIS IS NOT JUST FOR ENVIRONMENT IS ALSO FOR MOVING CARGO. BUT IT ALL RELATES TO CALIFORNIA'S PORTS BEING THE MOST COMPETITIVE PORTS IN THE NATION AND MOST HELIPORTS IN THE WORLD. THIS ALLOWS OUR PORTS TO MAKE THE CORRECT ECONOMIC DECISIONS TO ENSURE THAT OUR REPORTS REMAIN THE MOST COMPETITIVE BECAUSE IN TODAY'S GLOBALIZED ECONOMY IT'S VERY SIMPLE FOR BUSINESS TO GO ELSEWHERE. IN EITHER NORTH OF US THE SOUTH OF US OR AROUND THE COUNTRY FROM US AND THEY CAN BYPASS CALIFORNIA ENTIRELY. THIS SIMPLY GIVES OUR PORTS AWAY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN GET THE NET THE NECESSARY FUNDING TO MIX WITH THE MOST COMPETITIVE THE MOST ENERGY EFFICIENT. ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY. SIMPLY PUT THE PASSPORTS FOR PEOPLE TO USE THIS SUPPORT EVERYBODY THAT WORKS OUR PORTS THE SUPPORTS OUR ENTIRE STATE'S ECONOMY. ALLOWS CALIFORNIA MAINTAIN ITS POSITION AS AN ECONOMIC POWERHOUSE IT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY AND IN THIS BILL YET WE WE'VE SEEN OTHER. LEGISLATORS WORK TOWARDS. THE SCENE CONCEPTS THIS BILL IS YET ANOTHER STEP AND IT'S ANOTHER POSITIVE IMPACT THE LEGISLATURE CAN MAKE IN THE THE OVERALL ECONOMIC PARRIS OF CALIFORNIA. AND MAKING SURE REALLY WERE PROTECTING NOT JUST CALIFORNIA'S JOBS BUT OUR ECONOMY BECAUSE THIS REALLY IS A THIS IS ONE OF OUR KEY GEOGRAPHIC IN STRATEGIC ADVANTAGES THAT WE HAVE THE SPORTS SO FRESTON NEGLECT THEM AND NOT ALLOW THEM THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO STATE. THE MOST COMPETITIVE I WOULD BE DOING A DISSERVICE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS AND THIS BILL WOULD CORRECT THAT. THANK YOU AND NOT SAY WE HAVE ALL THIS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT WE AGREE WITH THAT RIGHT MEMBERS. ALRIGHT WITH THAT WE HAVE A A. THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACCEPTING AMENDMENTS MISTER SECRETARY WE CALL THE ROLL.
