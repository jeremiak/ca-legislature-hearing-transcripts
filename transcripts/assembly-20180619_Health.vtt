WE'RE NOT ARGUING THAT STUDENTS

00:40:53.284 --> 00:40:54.385
HEALTH SERVICES.

00:40:54.451 --> 00:40:55.886
WE'RE STILL UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND

00:40:55.953 --> 00:40:57.721
WHY THERE WOULD BE A PRIORITY ON

00:40:57.788 --> 00:40:59.390
THEM OVER YOUTH WERE NOT ABLE TO

00:40:59.456 --> 00:41:00.691

AND HAVE ACCESS TO PROGRAMS?

00:41:39.396 --> 00:41:41.732
WHY WE FAVOR THOSE IN COLLEGE

00:41:41.799 --> 00:41:42.566
WHEN MANY OF THOSE YOUTH ARE

00:41:42.633 --> 00:41:43.734
PRIVILEGED AND THEIR MENTAL

00:41:43.801 --> 00:41:46.170

00:41:46.237 --> 00:41:47.271
AREN'T THOSE YOUTH?

00:41:47.338 --> 00:41:48.973
AS EVER DESERVING OF THOSE WHO

00:41:49.039 --> 00:41:50.140
WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE

00:41:50.207 --> 00:41:51.709
GOING TO COLLEGE.

00:41:51.775 --> 00:41:52.676
I WISH I COULD SAY THAT THERE

00:41:52.743 --> 00:41:53.544

PREVENTION PROGRAMS.

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:57.648
AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND

00:41:57.715 --> 00:41:58.682
NEIGHBORHOODS WERE GRAYSON AT

00:41:58.749 --> 00:42:00.184
THE COMMUNITY EXISTS.

00:42:00.251 --> 00:42:03.721
BUT WE KNOW THIS IS NOT THE CASE.

00:42:03.787 --> 00:42:05.256
YOU THERE YOU IT WOULD BE EASY

00:42:05.322 --> 00:42:06.390
TO REMOVE THE PREFERENCE FOR

00:42:06.457 --> 00:42:09.226
COLLEGE PROGRAMS.

00:42:09.293 --> 00:42:10.828

00:43:01.879 --> 00:43:11.555
THINK.

00:43:11.622 --> 00:43:12.856
JANET FRANK --

00:43:12.923 --> 00:43:14.325
I'M A FACULTY MEMBER AT UCLA

00:43:14.391 --> 00:43:14.825
CENTER FOR HEALTH POLICY

00:43:14.892 --> 00:43:18.062
RESEARCH AND I AM THE DIRECTOR

00:43:18.128 --> 00:43:20.064
OF THE ONE AND ONLY STUDY THAT'S

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:21.265
BEEN DONE ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH

00:43:21.332 --> 00:43:23.400
SERVICE ACT AND OLDER ADULTS.

00:43:23.467 --> 00:43:24.568
SOMEBODY TO SHARE SOME

00:43:24.635 --> 00:43:26.337
INFORMATION ABOUT MY STUDY.

00:43:26.403 --> 00:43:28.906
AND ASK FOR ADDITIONAL

00:43:28.973 --> 00:43:30.407
AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL.

00:43:30.474 --> 00:43:32.977
IN RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANCE

00:43:33.043 --> 00:43:34.845
OF PREVENTION AND EARLIER VAN

00:43:34.912 --> 00:43:36.380
AND EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAMS

00:43:36.447 --> 00:43:39.850
FOR OLDER ADULTS --

00:43:39.917 --> 00:43:41.352
I HAVE SEVERAL CONCERNS ABOUT

00:43:41.418 --> 00:43:45.522
THE BILL. ONE IS THE ENTIRE --

00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:47.091
ISSUE OF THE COMMISSION --

00:43:47.157 --> 00:43:48.192
SETTING THE PRIORITIES RATHER

00:43:48.258 --> 00:43:49.760
THAN.

00:43:49.827 --> 00:43:51.996
THE ARE A HALLMARK REALLY OF THE

00:43:52.062 --> 00:43:53.697
MHSAA WHICH WAS --

00:43:53.764 --> 00:43:55.265
WHICH IS A ROBUST LOCAL

00:43:55.332 --> 00:43:58.235
STAKEHOLDER.

00:43:58.302 --> 00:43:58.836
SO I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT

00:43:58.902 --> 00:43:59.970
NOT.

00:44:00.037 --> 00:44:02.673
I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE FACT

00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:05.709
THAT THERE WAS A I BELIEVE IN

00:44:05.776 --> 00:44:07.644
AMENDED PORTION PUT INTO THE

00:44:07.711 --> 00:44:10.914
BILL THAT IF COUNTIES. ONE AND

00:44:10.981 --> 00:44:12.349
TWO IDENTIFY PROGRAMS THAT WERE

00:44:12.416 --> 00:44:14.385
OUTSIDE THE PRIORITIES OF THE

00:44:14.451 --> 00:44:17.788
YOUTH AND TRANSITIONAL AGE YOUTH --

00:44:17.855 --> 00:44:19.957
THAT THEY WOULD NEED TO DO

00:44:20.024 --> 00:44:21.992
ADDITIONAL WORK AND SO THIS OF

00:44:22.059 --> 00:44:24.128
COURSE IS A DISINCENTIVE. FOR

00:44:24.194 --> 00:44:27.297
COUNTIES TO ARM. TO PROMOTE

00:44:27.364 --> 00:44:29.400
PROGRAMS THAT HAVE --

00:44:29.466 --> 00:44:30.868
OTHER PRIORITIES SUCH AS THOSE

00:44:30.934 --> 00:44:33.203
FOR ADULTS AND OLDER ADULTS.

00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:34.538
THAT THIS CREATES A DOUBLE

00:44:34.605 --> 00:44:35.639
STANDARD.

00:44:35.706 --> 00:44:36.974
AND I BELIEVE THAT ALL THE

00:44:37.041 --> 00:44:38.142
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS SHOULD BE

00:44:38.208 --> 00:44:39.510
HELD TO THE SAME STANDARD IF IF

00:44:39.576 --> 00:44:42.246
THEY GO FORWARD.

00:44:42.312 --> 00:44:44.114
MY PRIMARY CONCERN IS REALLY HOW

00:44:44.181 --> 00:44:46.583
THE DID DEFINITION IN THE BILL.

00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:47.951
IS AROUND OUTREACH AND

00:44:48.018 --> 00:44:49.253
ENGAGEMENT WHICH IS QUITE

00:44:49.319 --> 00:44:51.388
LIMITED AND FOCUSED AS I QUOTE

00:44:51.455 --> 00:44:52.856
HERE.

00:44:52.923 --> 00:44:54.691
ON A SECONDARY SCHOOL IN

00:44:54.758 --> 00:44:55.859
TRANSITION AGE YOUTH WHAT THE

00:44:55.926 --> 00:44:56.894
PRIORITY ON PARTNERING WITH

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.896
COLLEGES --

00:44:58.962 --> 00:45:00.631
I AGREE THAT MENTAL HEALTH

00:45:00.697 --> 00:45:01.665
SERVICES FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS

00:45:01.732 --> 00:45:03.300
ARE IMPORTANT.

00:45:03.367 --> 00:45:05.569
BUT CURRENTLY --

00:45:05.636 --> 00:45:07.938
THERE IS QUITE A DISPARITY IN

00:45:08.005 --> 00:45:10.107
THE TYPES OF SERVICES THAT ARE

00:45:10.174 --> 00:45:12.042
BEING GIVEN TO PEOPLE ACROSS THE

00:45:12.109 --> 00:45:13.811
LIFESPAN.

00:45:13.877 --> 00:45:15.846
AND A MENTAL HEALTH --

00:45:15.913 --> 00:45:18.282
COMMISSION STUDY.

00:45:18.348 --> 00:45:20.451
I ACTUALLY SHOWED THAT CURRENTLY

00:45:20.517 --> 00:45:23.020
AROUND 80%.

00:45:23.087 --> 00:45:25.355
OF FUNDING OF FUNDING FOR

00:45:25.422 --> 00:45:27.424
PREVENTION PROGRAMS IS GOING TO

00:45:27.491 --> 00:45:29.359
CHILDREN AND YOUTH.

00:45:29.426 --> 00:45:32.663
ABOUT 19% TO ADULTS AND ONE

00:45:32.729 --> 00:45:35.999
POINT 5% TO OLDER ADULTS.

00:45:36.066 --> 00:45:37.835
THIS BILL WILL LASSEN AN

00:45:37.901 --> 00:45:38.902
INCREASE THAT DISPARITY EVEN

00:45:38.969 --> 00:45:40.304
FURTHER.

00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:42.439
SO I BELIEVE THAT OLDER ADULTS

00:45:42.506 --> 00:45:43.674
SHOULD ACTUALLY BE OUR PRIORITY

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:46.643
POPULATION. FOR THIS BILL

00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:47.978
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A NUMBER OF

00:45:48.045 --> 00:45:49.213
MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS AND I JUST

00:45:49.279 --> 00:45:50.414
WANTED TO QUICKLY REVIEW SOME OF

00:45:50.481 --> 00:45:52.382
THOSE.

00:45:52.449 --> 00:45:54.618
THEY HAVE SIGNIFICANT RISK OF

00:45:54.685 --> 00:45:56.854
MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS DO TO

00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:59.523
FAILING HEALTH ISOLATION

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:00.991
ECONOMIC AND SECURITY.

00:46:01.058 --> 00:46:01.925
AND VULNERABILITY TO

00:46:01.992 --> 00:46:04.061
EXPLOITATION.

00:46:04.128 --> 00:46:06.897
OLDER ADULTS ARE THE LARGEST OUR

00:46:06.964 --> 00:46:08.699
FASTEST GROWING AGE COHORT IN

00:46:08.765 --> 00:46:09.633
THE NATION AND ALSO IN

00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:11.535
CALIFORNIA.

THE TENSION NEVER SEEN HERE HAS

00:49:48.618 --> 00:49:51.221

GROW MORE --

00:50:08.238 --> 00:50:09.473

00:50:09.539 --> 00:50:12.075
AMOUNT OF FUNDING A TO GO AROUND

00:50:12.142 --> 00:50:13.310

OCCURS ACROSS.

00:51:01.258 --> 00:51:03.260
THE LIFESPAN WHEN YOU LOOK AT

00:51:03.326 --> 00:51:05.862

00:51:42.699 --> 00:51:45.035

00:51:54.544 --> 00:51:56.112

00:51:56.179 --> 00:51:58.648
TAKE A LOT OF WORK. TO TRY TO

00:51:58.715 --> 00:52:03.487

OF THOSE PROGRAMS IS TO BE

00:52:27.310 --> 00:52:28.545
MEASURED AND THAT'S THE WAY THAT

00:52:28.612 --> 00:52:30.080
IN ADDITION TO THE BROAD

00:52:30.146 --> 00:52:30.580
FLEXIBILITY IN THE FIVE

00:52:30.647 --> 00:52:32.249

WANT TO SPEND THE MONEY A LITTLE

00:52:37.187 --> 00:52:39.022

00:52:47.998 --> 00:52:48.999
WITH --

00:52:49.065 --> 00:52:50.500
DAMAGE TO SAY.

00:52:50.567 --> 00:52:52.002
IS WE HAVE COUNTIES THAT THERE'S

02:22:47.558 --> 02:22:49.727
LEGISLATION. TO INFORM PATIENTS

02:22:49.794 --> 02:22:51.829
ABOUT THEIR BREAST DENSITY.

02:22:51.896 --> 02:22:53.531
AND A LOT HAS CHANGED SINCE THEN

02:22:53.598 --> 02:22:54.632
BUT ONE THING THAT HASN'T

02:22:54.699 --> 02:22:56.567
CHANGED I MY PARALYZING FEAR OF

02:22:56.634 --> 02:22:58.169
PUBLIC SPEAKING.

02:22:58.236 --> 02:23:00.305
SO PLEASE BEAR WITH ME AS READ

02:23:00.371 --> 02:23:04.842
MY STATEMENT ON UP BACK IN TWO

02:23:04.909 --> 02:23:05.610
THOUSAND ELEVEN I HAD RECENTLY

02:23:05.677 --> 02:23:07.111
RECOVERED FROM A BRUTAL BATTLE

02:23:07.178 --> 02:23:08.479
WITH ADVANCED STAGE BREAST

02:23:08.546 --> 02:23:09.881
CANCER.

02:23:09.948 --> 02:23:11.516
PRIOR TO MY DIAGNOSIS I HAD

02:23:11.582 --> 02:23:12.517
FAITHFULLY FOLLOWED THE

02:23:12.583 --> 02:23:14.485
GUIDELINES FOR SCREENINGS BUT

02:23:14.552 --> 02:23:15.954
UNBEKNOWNST TO ME I HAD DENSE

02:23:16.020 --> 02:23:17.722
BREAST TISSUE.

02:23:17.789 --> 02:23:19.824
THIS MEANT THAT MY MAMMOGRAM

02:23:19.891 --> 02:23:21.259
RESULTS WERE MUCH LESS ACCURATE

02:23:21.326 --> 02:23:23.061
AND I WAS AT AN INCREASED RISK

02:23:23.127 --> 02:23:24.796
FOR DEVELOPING BREAST CANCER.

02:23:24.862 --> 02:23:25.830
HAD I BEEN GIVEN THIS

02:23:25.897 --> 02:23:27.198
INFORMATION THERE IS A GREAT

02:23:27.265 --> 02:23:28.900
LIKELIHOOD THAT MY DIAGNOSIS

02:23:28.967 --> 02:23:30.435
WOULD HAVE COME EARLIER

02:23:30.501 --> 02:23:31.736
RESULTING IN A MORE FAVORABLE

02:23:31.803 --> 02:23:33.371
PROGNOSIS AND SPARING ME A GREAT

02:23:33.438 --> 02:23:35.406
DEAL OF SUFFERING.

02:23:35.473 --> 02:23:37.275
THE MOMENT I LEARNED THIS WAS

02:23:37.342 --> 02:23:39.110
THE MOMENT WHEN I DECIDED THAT

02:23:39.177 --> 02:23:41.045
NO OTHER WOMAN SHOULD EVER HAVE

02:23:41.112 --> 02:23:42.513
TO SUFFER A DELAYED BREAST

02:23:42.580 --> 02:23:43.781
CANCER DIAGNOSIS.

02:23:43.848 --> 02:23:46.150
UNNECESSARILY.

02:23:46.217 --> 02:23:48.319
THE INTENT OF SB TEN THIRTY FOUR

02:23:48.386 --> 02:23:49.620
IS TO EDUCATE AND RAISE

02:23:49.687 --> 02:23:51.589
AWARENESS SO THAT ALL PATIENTS

02:23:51.656 --> 02:23:52.790
HAVE THE GREATEST CHANCE FOR

02:23:52.857 --> 02:23:54.892
EARLY DETECTION.

02:23:54.959 --> 02:23:56.194
EVERY PATIENT SHOULD HAVE THE

02:23:56.260 --> 02:23:57.996
INFORMATION SHE NEEDS TO HAVE AN

02:23:58.062 --> 02:23:59.263
INFORMED DISCUSSION WITH HER

02:23:59.330 --> 02:24:01.666
PHYSICIAN ABOUT HER PERSONAL SET

02:24:01.733 --> 02:24:03.434
OF RISK FACTORS AND THE BEST

02:24:03.501 --> 02:24:05.036
PLAN OF SCREENING.

02:24:05.103 --> 02:24:07.305
BASED ON HER RISK FACTORS.

02:24:07.372 --> 02:24:09.640
IF THE LAW IS ALLOWED TO EXPIRE

02:24:09.707 --> 02:24:11.075
WE WILL GO BACK TO A TIME WHEN

02:24:11.142 --> 02:24:12.910
MANY WOMEN RECEIVED NEGATIVE

02:24:12.977 --> 02:24:14.412
MAMMOGRAM RESULTS.

02:24:14.479 --> 02:24:15.780
WHEN IN FACT THEY DID HAVE

02:24:15.847 --> 02:24:17.882
INVASIVE CANCER?

02:24:17.949 --> 02:24:18.883
THERE HAVE BEEN NO ADVERSE

02:24:18.950 --> 02:24:19.751
RESULTS SINCE THE LAW WENT INTO

02:24:19.817 --> 02:24:21.319
EFFECT.

02:24:21.386 --> 02:24:22.620
DESPITE THE CONCERNS OF

02:24:22.687 --> 02:24:24.956
OPPONENTS IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE

02:24:25.023 --> 02:24:26.691
WOMEN HAVE NOT PANICKED AND HAVE

02:24:26.758 --> 02:24:28.026
PROVED THEY CAN HANDLE THIS

02:24:28.092 --> 02:24:30.561
INFORMATION QUITE WELL.

02:24:30.628 --> 02:24:31.896
A SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT

02:24:31.963 --> 02:24:33.364
RESULTING FROM THE WIDESPREAD

02:24:33.431 --> 02:24:34.966
BREAST DENSITY LAWS ACROSS THE

02:24:35.033 --> 02:24:36.801
NATION IS THAT MEDICAL AND

02:24:36.868 --> 02:24:39.337
CANCER ORGANIZATIONS NOW REGARD

02:24:39.404 --> 02:24:40.838
DENSE BREAST TISSUE AS THE MOST

02:24:40.905 --> 02:24:43.374
PREVALENT AND COMMON RISK FACTOR.

02:24:43.441 --> 02:24:46.377
ECLIPSING EVEN FAMILY HISTORY.

02:24:46.444 --> 02:24:47.545
THIS MAKES THE CASE FOR

02:24:47.612 --> 02:24:49.247
PROVIDING WOMEN INFORMATION

02:24:49.313 --> 02:24:50.648
ABOUT THEIR BREAST DENSITY EVEN

02:24:50.715 --> 02:24:53.618
MORE CRITICAL. TO GO BACKWARDS

02:24:53.684 --> 02:24:54.852
WOULD NOT ONLY BE A GREAT

02:24:54.919 --> 02:24:56.587
DISSERVICE BUT POTENTIALLY FATAL

02:24:56.654 --> 02:24:58.923
FOR SOME.

02:24:58.990 --> 02:25:01.192
WHEN CANCERS DETECTED EARLY IT

02:25:01.259 --> 02:25:03.194
IS MORE SURVIVABLE TREATMENT IS

02:25:03.261 --> 02:25:04.495
LESS BRUTAL AND IT IS LESS

02:25:04.562 --> 02:25:07.765
COSTLY? FIVE YEARS AGO THE

02:25:07.832 --> 02:25:09.367
LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR

02:25:09.434 --> 02:25:10.668
REALIZE THE VALUE OF DENSITY

02:25:10.735 --> 02:25:12.770
NOTIFICATION.

02:25:12.837 --> 02:25:14.072

EARLIEST OF THE THIRTY FIVE

02:25:15.940 --> 02:25:17.809

02:25:19.110 --> 02:25:21.646

THIS YEAR BY TWO BURKE.

02:31:43.861 --> 02:31:45.396
THE LIT REVIEW ASK QUESTIONS

02:31:45.463 --> 02:31:46.630
BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THE LANGUAGE

02:31:46.697 --> 02:31:47.932
IN OUR BILL.

02:31:47.998 --> 02:31:49.333
BUT ULTIMATELY ONE OF THE KEY

02:31:49.400 --> 02:31:51.068
FINDINGS WAS.

02:31:51.135 --> 02:31:52.069
YOU BURKE CONCLUDES THAT THERE

02:31:52.136 --> 02:31:53.471
IS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE

02:31:53.537 --> 02:31:54.538
REGARDING THE EFFECTS OF THE

02:31:54.605 --> 02:31:56.440

02:31:56.507 --> 02:31:57.441
OF PERSONAL BRENT YESTERDAY

02:31:57.508 --> 02:31:58.742
DENSITY.

02:31:58.809 --> 02:32:00.478
INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE IS NOT

02:32:00.544 --> 02:32:02.880
QUOTE EVIDENCE OF NO EFFECT IT

02:32:02.947 --> 02:32:05.115
IS POSSIBLE THAT IT IMPACT COULD

02:32:05.182 --> 02:32:06.750
RESULT FROM THESE LAWS BUT

02:32:06.817 --> 02:32:08.018
CURRENT EVIDENCE IS INSUFFICIENT

02:32:08.085 --> 02:32:09.954
TO INFORM AN ESTIMATE.

02:32:10.020 --> 02:32:13.958
SO MY ARGUMENT IS SIMPLY THAT.

02:32:14.024 --> 02:32:15.092
WOMEN HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW ABOUT

02:32:15.159 --> 02:32:17.161

THE SUNSET --

02:32:30.274 --> 02:32:32.243
IF THE EXPECTATION ON THE SUNSET

02:32:32.309 --> 02:32:33.844
IS THAT THE RESEARCH MAY

02:32:33.911 --> 02:32:34.645
ULTIMATELY COME UP WITH A

02:32:34.712 --> 02:32:36.080

02:32:37.448 --> 02:32:38.315
FRANKLY.

02:32:38.382 --> 02:32:39.517
BECAUSE FRANKLY WERE ASKING THE

02:32:39.583 --> 02:32:41.852

ARE EMPOWERED WITH INFORMATION

02:32:46.190 --> 02:32:47.625

TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH

02:32:51.095 --> 02:32:51.562
THEIR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER

02:32:51.629 --> 02:32:52.596
THAT'S A GOOD THING.

02:32:52.663 --> 02:32:53.697

BEFORE IT DOES A PLAN CORRECTION?

03:02:47.790 --> 03:02:49.792
IF THAT DEFICIENCY REACHES A

03:02:49.858 --> 03:02:51.493
LEVEL WHERE A PATIENT HAS HARMED

03:02:51.560 --> 03:02:53.429
BECAUSE OF IT OR THERE'S THE

03:02:53.495 --> 03:02:54.730
POTENTIAL FOR HARM.

03:02:54.797 --> 03:02:56.198
THAT'S WHERE THE ADMINISTRATIVE

03:02:56.265 --> 03:02:57.633
PENALTY REGULATION I'M COMES

03:02:57.700 --> 03:03:00.769
INTO EFFECT AND HERE'S A LITTLE

03:03:00.836 --> 03:03:02.838
STAFFING UP A LITTLE.

03:03:02.905 --> 03:03:04.173
MIX OF HOW THEY LOOK AT THE

03:03:04.239 --> 03:03:05.708
COUNTIES AND ONE OF THE THINGS

03:03:05.774 --> 03:03:07.109
THEY LOOK AT IS THE SCOPE AND

03:03:07.176 --> 03:03:10.346
SEVERITY OF THE DEFICIENCY IS

03:03:10.412 --> 03:03:12.781
THIS A ONE TIME INCIDENT BECAUSE

03:03:12.848 --> 03:03:14.350
SOMEONE CALLED AND COOK SICK AND

03:03:14.416 --> 03:03:15.317
THEY COULDN'T GET STAFFING FOR

03:03:15.384 --> 03:03:15.851
THE DAY.

03:03:15.918 --> 03:03:18.520
OR IS THIS WHOLE WIDESPREAD --

03:03:18.587 --> 03:03:21.824
EVENT THE US RELATIONS REQUIRE

03:03:21.890 --> 03:03:23.425
THE DEPARTMENT TO LOOK AT ALL OF

03:03:23.492 --> 03:03:25.160
THE FACTORS THAT RELATE TO THAT

03:03:25.227 --> 03:03:27.830
DEFICIENCY NOT JUST BEING OUT OF

03:03:27.896 --> 03:03:28.831
COMPLIANCE.

03:03:28.897 --> 03:03:30.666
DIDN'T HARM THE PATIENT TO THE

03:03:30.733 --> 03:03:32.835
HOSPITAL IDENTIFY IT IN ADVANCE

03:03:32.901 --> 03:03:34.303
IT'S A FILL FACILITY HAVE A

03:03:34.370 --> 03:03:36.572
HISTORY OF OUT OF COMPLIANCE

03:03:36.638 --> 03:03:39.041
WITH THIS SORT OF VIOLATION.

03:03:39.108 --> 03:03:40.843
SO WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE

03:03:40.909 --> 03:03:43.245
SUFFICIENT MECHANISMS IN PLACE

03:03:43.312 --> 03:03:44.513
THAT IF.

03:03:44.580 --> 03:03:45.881
A VIOLATION OF THE STAFFING

03:03:45.948 --> 03:03:47.850
RATIOS REACHES A LEVEL OF

03:03:47.916 --> 03:03:49.118
PATIENT HARM A POTENTIAL PATIENT

03:03:49.184 --> 03:03:50.185
HARM THAT THESE REGULATIONS

03:03:50.252 --> 03:03:55.324
WOULD KICK IN.

03:03:55.391 --> 03:03:57.359
ANYONE ELSE OPPOSITION.

03:03:57.426 --> 03:03:58.260

03:04:01.196 --> 03:04:02.898
OPPOSITION'S FOR THE REASONS

[inaudible]

03:04:04.700 --> 03:04:07.169

LEADERSHIP FORUM IS ALSO IN

03:04:09.471 --> 03:04:11.673

IT'S RODRIGUEZ.

03:04:18.347 --> 03:04:19.915
I DON'T THINK THAT'S SENATOR FOR

03:04:19.982 --> 03:04:20.949
BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD

03:04:21.016 --> 03:04:22.818
SOMETHING --

03:04:22.885 --> 03:04:24.686
THAT I CAN ATTEST TO THAT I'VE

03:04:24.753 --> 03:04:25.687
NOTICED IN MANY YEARS WORKING

03:04:27.222 --> 03:04:29.091
BEING A MANY HOSPITALS AND

03:04:29.158 --> 03:04:29.691
PRIMARILY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

03:04:29.758 --> 03:04:30.859

03:04:30.926 --> 03:04:33.562

MANUALS AND POLICIES THAT ARE

03:04:56.585 --> 03:04:59.388
GIVEN BUT UNFORTUNATELY --

03:04:59.455 --> 03:05:00.856
A LOT OF FOLKS DON'T FALL BY IT

03:05:00.923 --> 03:05:03.192

03:05:15.604 --> 03:05:16.738
QUANTUM.

03:05:46.869 --> 03:05:47.970
SIMPLY NOT ACCURATE.

OR TALK ABOUT I'VE SEEN FIRST

03:18:14.983 --> 03:18:16.451
HAND AYE ANDERSON WHO TRAINS

PHARMACISTS DO THIS KIND OF WORK

03:18:18.319 --> 03:18:20.588
MEDICATION MANAGEMENT SWEAT TO

03:18:20.655 --> 03:18:21.522
CLARIFY THREE POINTS.

03:18:21.589 --> 03:18:22.323
THE FIRST SAYS THIS BILL

03:18:22.390 --> 03:18:24.158
PROPOSES THAT ONLY DOCTORAL

03:18:24.225 --> 03:18:26.728
LEVEL PHARMACISTS WITH THE

03:18:26.794 --> 03:18:28.162
ADVANCED TRAINING AND EXPERTISE

03:18:28.229 --> 03:18:29.931
IN HYPERTENSION MANAGEMENT ARE

03:18:29.998 --> 03:18:31.699
ALLOWED TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES.

03:18:31.766 --> 03:18:33.301
AND THEN BE PAID FOR THEM --

03:18:33.368 --> 03:18:35.136
THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE CURRENTLY

03:18:35.203 --> 03:18:36.904
AND CALIFORNIA STATE LAW ALREADY

03:18:36.971 --> 03:18:38.906
SUPPORTS ALL OF THE SERVICES

03:18:38.973 --> 03:18:40.875
BEING DESCRIBED IN THIS BILL.

03:18:40.942 --> 03:18:43.378
AS A LAW DESCRIBES A MAKE HUGE

03:18:43.444 --> 03:18:44.145
MESS Y. PHARMACISTS IS NOT

03:18:44.212 --> 03:18:45.413
INDEPENDENT SERVICE IT'S A

03:18:45.480 --> 03:18:47.615
COLLABORATION BETWEEN PATIENT

03:18:47.682 --> 03:18:49.450
PHYSICIAN PHARMACIST UNDER A

03:18:49.517 --> 03:18:50.752
CLOUD WERE PRACTICES GOING OR

03:18:50.818 --> 03:18:51.686
PROTOCOL.

03:18:51.753 --> 03:18:53.488
THAT'S AUTHORIZED AND SIGNED BY

03:18:53.554 --> 03:18:55.456
PHYSICIANS BY MEDICAL GROUPS FOR

03:18:55.523 --> 03:18:55.923
THE HEALTH SYSTEM --

03:18:55.990 --> 03:18:58.493
THIS IS. TWO THREE OF ITS AT

03:18:58.559 --> 03:19:00.028
THEIR CONSTANT COMMUNICATION IS

03:19:00.094 --> 03:19:00.895
REQUIRED BY STATE LAW --

03:19:00.962 --> 03:19:02.363
THOUGH THERE'S NO FRAGMENTATION

03:19:02.430 --> 03:19:03.965
OF CARE THE CURLERS THROUGH THIS

03:19:04.032 --> 03:19:05.767
PROGRAM AND I CAN SEE THAT WITH

03:19:05.833 --> 03:19:07.068
COMPAS BECAUSE MY THIRD POINT.

03:19:07.135 --> 03:19:08.603
IS THIS PRACTICE OF HAVING

03:19:08.670 --> 03:19:10.238
QUALIFIED PHARMACISTS MANAGE

03:19:10.305 --> 03:19:11.773
MEDICATIONS FOR CHRONIC DISEASES

03:19:11.839 --> 03:19:13.241
LIKE HYPERTENSION HAS BEEN IN

03:19:13.308 --> 03:19:15.143
EFFECT IN CALIFORNIA FOR FIVE

03:19:15.209 --> 03:19:16.711
DECADES IN THE VA HEALTH SYSTEM

03:19:16.778 --> 03:19:17.912
AND KAISER --

03:19:17.979 --> 03:19:19.280
THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THIS

03:19:19.347 --> 03:19:21.149
BILLS PROPOSING MEDICAL PAYMENT

03:19:21.215 --> 03:19:23.051
FOR THE SERVICES TO ALLOW THE

03:19:23.117 --> 03:19:24.552
SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED MORE

03:19:24.619 --> 03:19:25.987
WIDELY A CENTER STONE HAS IS AS

03:19:26.054 --> 03:19:27.689
DESCRIBED IN NO PUBLIC PLACES

03:19:27.755 --> 03:19:29.957
LIKE BARBER SHOPS AND PHARMACIES.

03:19:30.024 --> 03:19:31.759
OUT WE RECENTLY COMPLETED A

03:19:31.826 --> 03:19:32.660
THREE YEAR GRANT FROM THE CENTER

03:19:32.727 --> 03:19:34.362
FOR MEDICARE MEDICAID INNOVATION

03:19:34.429 --> 03:19:35.897
IN RULING SIX THOUSAND LETS YOU

03:19:35.963 --> 03:19:36.731
KNOW MEDI CAL PATIENTS

03:19:36.798 --> 03:19:38.366
HYPERTENSION WAS ONE OF THE TOP

03:19:38.433 --> 03:19:39.600
CONDITIONS AND WE DEMONSTRATED

03:19:39.667 --> 03:19:39.801
THAT.

03:19:39.867 --> 03:19:41.469
HAVING PHARMACIST MANAGE

03:19:41.536 --> 03:19:43.604
HYPERTENSION [inaudible]

03:19:43.671 --> 03:19:46.040
CARE.

03:19:46.107 --> 03:19:47.642
I'M I TO TURN THIS OVER SNOUT

03:19:47.709 --> 03:19:48.643
WHO DUCKED AROUND VICTOR.

03:19:48.710 --> 03:19:49.977
WILL TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE

03:19:50.044 --> 03:19:51.446
AND VALUE OF THIS BILL SWAN ALSO

03:19:51.512 --> 03:19:53.548
CLARIFY THAT DOCTOR VICTOR HAS

03:19:53.614 --> 03:19:55.049
WRITTEN THE BOOK ON HYPERTENSION

03:19:55.116 --> 03:19:56.484
HE IS THE AUTHOR OF THE

03:19:56.551 --> 03:19:58.119
HYPERTENSION TEXTBOOK.

03:19:58.186 --> 03:19:59.354
THAT THE MEDICAL WORLD READS TO

03:19:59.420 --> 03:20:00.922
LEARN ABOUT HYPERTENSION AND THE

03:20:00.988 --> 03:20:02.256
AUTHORS THE CHAPTERS I

03:20:02.323 --> 03:20:03.925
CARDIOLOGISTS READ TO LEARN

03:20:03.991 --> 03:20:04.492
ABOUT MANAGING HYPERTENSION

03:20:04.559 --> 03:20:05.827
AFTER [inaudible]

03:20:05.893 --> 03:20:07.195
STEVE.

03:20:07.261 --> 03:20:08.229
SO HYPERTENSION HIGH BLOOD

03:20:08.296 --> 03:20:09.831
PRESSURE.

03:20:09.897 --> 03:20:10.832
BECAUSE HIS HALF OF ALL HEART

03:20:10.898 --> 03:20:13.067
ATTACKS. THREE QUARTERS OF ALL

03:20:13.134 --> 03:20:14.202
STROKES [inaudible]

03:20:14.268 --> 03:20:16.137
I'M.

03:20:16.204 --> 03:20:18.139
WE WE HAVE WE CAN'T CURE MOST

03:20:18.206 --> 03:20:19.841
CASES OF HYPERTENSION BUT WE CAN

03:20:19.907 --> 03:20:21.476
CONTROL MOST OF THEM.

03:20:21.542 --> 03:20:22.744
WITH REALLY EXCELLENT

03:20:22.810 --> 03:20:23.878
MEDICATIONS THERE NOW GENERIC

03:20:23.945 --> 03:20:25.880
AND LOW COST.

03:20:25.947 --> 03:20:28.449
AND BUT IN THE REAL WORLD.

03:20:28.516 --> 03:20:31.085
ON ITS HERE TO STONE POINTED OUT

03:20:31.152 --> 03:20:32.987
I'D MAJORITY OF OF FOLKS

03:20:33.054 --> 03:20:34.155
EFFECTIVE WITH HIGH BLOOD

03:20:34.222 --> 03:20:34.722
PRESSURE.

03:20:34.789 --> 03:20:36.391
DON'T ACHIEVE A SAFE BLOOD

03:20:36.457 --> 03:20:38.292
PRESSURE LEVEL TODAY.

03:20:38.359 --> 03:20:39.627
SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM MULLIN

03:20:39.694 --> 03:20:41.028
PART DOCTORS YOU'RE SO BUSY

03:20:41.095 --> 03:20:42.463
GETTING PRESSURED TO SEE MORE

03:20:42.530 --> 03:20:44.165
AND MORE PATIENTS.

03:20:44.232 --> 03:20:46.667
THE TIME THAT DOCTOR PATIENT

03:20:46.734 --> 03:20:47.535
VISIT IS IS WAY TOO SHORT AND

03:20:47.602 --> 03:20:49.270
WE'D LIKE.

03:20:49.337 --> 03:20:50.538
AND CONDITION PENSIONS CAN PUSH

03:20:50.605 --> 03:20:52.874
BACK AND SOMETIMES I DON'T

03:20:52.940 --> 03:20:54.742
COMPLY WITH ALL BE ALL THE AS

03:20:54.809 --> 03:20:56.477
PRESCRIBED.

03:20:56.544 --> 03:20:57.845
THERE HAVE BEEN --

03:20:57.912 --> 03:20:59.046
OVER FORTY TRIALS AND HELP

03:20:59.113 --> 03:21:00.815
PUBLISHED THEY PROVIDE

03:21:00.882 --> 03:21:02.817
OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE.

03:21:02.884 --> 03:21:04.819
AND THAT THE BEST WAY TO CONTROL

03:21:04.886 --> 03:21:06.821
HYPERTENSION IN PRACTICE IS WITH

03:21:06.888 --> 03:21:08.956
THE PHARMACIST PHYSICIAN TEAM

03:21:09.023 --> 03:21:09.690
APPROACH TO HYPERTENSION

03:21:09.757 --> 03:21:12.160
MANAGEMENT.

03:21:12.226 --> 03:21:13.694
NOW IN MY OWN STUDY WHICH IS

03:21:13.761 --> 03:21:15.396
RECENTLY PUBLISHED.

03:21:15.463 --> 03:21:17.365
ITEM DOCTORATE LEVEL PHARMACISTS

03:21:17.432 --> 03:21:19.400
MADE HOUSE CALLS TO AFRICAN

03:21:19.467 --> 03:21:21.769
AMERICAN OWNED BARBERSHOPS.

03:21:21.836 --> 03:21:23.237
SO THERE THEY MET THE THE

03:21:23.304 --> 03:21:25.306
PATRONS ITEM THEY WERE THEY I

03:21:25.373 --> 03:21:27.475
RECONCILED THE MEDICATIONS THAT

03:21:27.542 --> 03:21:28.876
MEASURE BLOOD PRESSURE.

03:21:28.943 --> 03:21:30.678
I THINK CHECK LABORATORY RESULTS

03:21:30.745 --> 03:21:32.213
RIGHT THERE IN THE BARBER SHOP.

03:21:32.280 --> 03:21:33.848
AND THEY PRESCRIBE MEDICATIONS

03:22:09.851 --> 03:22:11.419
IN MY OPINION THIS BILL.

03:22:11.486 --> 03:22:16.691

THE PHARMACIST LED PROGRAM HAD

03:22:33.241 --> 03:22:34.575
NO EFFECT ON THE FREQUENCY OF

03:22:34.642 --> 03:22:36.110
DOCTOR VISITS.

03:22:36.177 --> 03:22:37.645

PHARMACISTS AND THAT'S ACTUALLY

03:24:31.325 --> 03:24:32.226

DOCTORAL DEGREE THAT'S ALSO

03:24:37.598 --> 03:24:38.699

SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BILL

03:24:40.134 --> 03:24:42.236

03:25:02.490 --> 03:25:03.157
BUT IT IS --

03:25:03.224 --> 03:25:04.825
APPLE TO A BROADER GROUP OF

03:25:04.892 --> 03:25:06.727
FARMS IS THEY DO NOT HAVE THE

03:25:06.794 --> 03:25:08.596
ADVANCED LEVEL OF TRAINING

03:25:08.663 --> 03:25:10.331

TO FOR A FEW MOMENTS TO PRESENT

03:25:23.544 --> 03:25:24.679
OUR VIEWS OF THE CALIFORNIA

03:25:24.745 --> 03:25:25.713
CHAPTER AMERICAN COLLEGE OF

03:25:25.780 --> 03:25:28.015
CARDIOLOGY.

03:25:28.082 --> 03:25:29.316
MY UNDERSTANDING IS HISTORICALLY

03:25:29.383 --> 03:25:30.851
THE PURPOSES BILL WAS REALLY TO

03:25:30.918 --> 03:25:33.154
PROVIDE IMPROVED ACCESS --

03:25:33.220 --> 03:25:34.355
TO MEDICAL CARE TO THOSE WHO ARE

03:25:34.422 --> 03:25:35.356
IN NEED --

03:25:35.423 --> 03:25:37.191
I'M NOT AN EXPERT AT THE ENGLISH

03:25:37.258 --> 03:25:38.826
SHE'S THAT THESE BILLS ARE --

03:25:38.893 --> 03:25:41.262
WRITTEN AND HOWEVER I REALLY AM

03:25:41.328 --> 03:25:42.963
HARD PRESSED TO FIND REALLY HOW --

03:25:43.030 --> 03:25:45.232
THIS SEEMS TO BE --

03:25:45.299 --> 03:25:45.800
THE CASE THERE'S NO QUESTION

03:25:45.866 --> 03:25:47.468
THAT THE EXCELLENT WORK UP

03:25:47.535 --> 03:25:50.938
PRESENTED.

03:25:51.005 --> 03:25:53.407
REALLY CREATES A CLOSED LOOP.

03:25:53.474 --> 03:25:56.377
EFFICIENT MODEL WITHIN A CLOSELY

03:25:56.444 --> 03:25:58.612
WATCHED CLINICAL PROTOCOL.

03:25:58.679 --> 03:26:00.681
WHERE THERE IS?

03:26:00.748 --> 03:26:02.249
CONTINUOUS COLLABORATION WITH

03:26:02.316 --> 03:26:04.318
PHYSICIANS THERE'S CONTINUOUS

03:26:04.385 --> 03:26:06.020
COLLABORATION IN TERMS OF THE

03:26:06.087 --> 03:26:07.555
MOVEMENT OF INFORMATION.

03:26:07.621 --> 03:26:10.057
AND I THINK THAT THAT HOWEVER IS

03:26:10.124 --> 03:26:12.660
NOT NECESSARILY HOW THIS PROGRAM

03:26:12.727 --> 03:26:13.861
IS GOING TO RUN WITH THIS

03:26:13.928 --> 03:26:15.830
LEGISLATION.

03:26:15.896 --> 03:26:17.765
THERE REALLY ARE NO CAB YACHTS.

03:26:17.832 --> 03:26:19.400
THE WITHOUT REGARD TO EDUCATION

03:26:19.467 --> 03:26:20.868
EVEN FURNISHING TRAVEL MEDICINE

03:26:20.935 --> 03:26:22.303
FALLS PROTOCOLS FURNISHING THE

03:26:22.369 --> 03:26:23.738
LOCKS SOUND.

03:26:23.804 --> 03:26:24.739
HAS PARTICULAR PROTOCOLS

03:26:24.805 --> 03:26:26.307
ADMINISTRATION HORMONAL

03:26:26.373 --> 03:26:28.209
CONTRACEPTIVES IN CONSULTATION

03:26:28.275 --> 03:26:29.443
WITH THE AMERICAN CONGRESS OF

03:26:29.510 --> 03:26:32.146
OBGYN IMMUNIZATIONS REALLY --

03:26:32.213 --> 03:26:34.448
FOLLOW PROTOCOL FROM THE CBC YET

03:26:34.515 --> 03:26:35.583
HOWEVER THERE REALLY ARE NO

03:26:35.649 --> 03:26:36.650
PROTOCOLS THERE'S NO

03:26:36.717 --> 03:26:38.119
CERTIFICATION AND THERE IS NO

03:26:38.185 --> 03:26:39.220
TRAINING.

03:26:39.286 --> 03:26:40.287
AND BLOOD PRESSURE IS MUCH MORE

03:26:40.354 --> 03:26:42.690
THAN A NUMBER.

03:26:42.757 --> 03:26:44.024
THIS IS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PAGES.

03:26:44.091 --> 03:26:45.025
OF THE GUIDELINES FOR THE

03:26:45.092 --> 03:26:46.427
AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY

03:26:46.494 --> 03:26:47.828
AND AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION

03:26:47.895 --> 03:26:49.063
LIKE THE PAST THIS PERHAPS

03:26:49.130 --> 03:26:51.599
AROUND TO THE ARE LEGISLATORS

03:26:51.665 --> 03:26:52.166
HERE.

03:26:52.233 --> 03:26:53.534
IT REALLY GOES TO SHOW REALLY

03:26:53.601 --> 03:26:54.835
THE COMPLEXITY WITH WHICH

03:26:54.902 --> 03:26:57.138
HYPERTENS CAMP CAN BE --

03:26:57.204 --> 03:26:59.840
EFFECT THAT AND MY CONCERN IS

03:26:59.907 --> 03:27:00.841
THAT THE TREATMENT OF

03:27:00.908 --> 03:27:02.810
HYPERTENSION UNDER THE PROPOSED

03:27:02.877 --> 03:27:05.246
DOES NOT ALLOW FOR THE EFFICIENT

03:27:05.312 --> 03:27:07.481
COLLABORATION THE MOVEMENT OF

03:27:07.548 --> 03:27:09.383
INFORMATION FROM THE PHARMACY TO

03:27:09.450 --> 03:27:10.151
MY OFFICE.

03:27:10.217 --> 03:27:11.318
I'M OUT THIS PATIENT IS NOW

03:27:11.385 --> 03:27:12.720
GOING TO BE TREATED IN A VERY

03:27:12.787 --> 03:27:15.122
DISJOINTED WAY BY THE PHARMACIST

03:27:15.189 --> 03:27:16.290
BY THE INTERNET BY THE

03:27:16.357 --> 03:27:17.858
CARDIOLOGISTS UNLESS THERE

03:27:17.925 --> 03:27:20.327
REALLY IS EFFORTS TO ENHANCE THE

03:27:20.394 --> 03:27:22.396
LEVEL OF COMMUNICATION AGAIN.

03:27:22.463 --> 03:27:23.931
MY CONCERN IS THE LACK OF

03:27:23.998 --> 03:27:24.765
TRAINING THE LACK OF

03:27:24.832 --> 03:27:27.034
CERTIFICATION IN TERMS OF THIS

03:27:27.101 --> 03:27:29.170
PROCESS ALSO I'M A BIT CONCERNED

03:27:29.236 --> 03:27:30.905
PARTICULARLY IF THERE'S BETH

03:27:30.971 --> 03:27:31.472
PHARMACISTS ARE GOING TO BE

03:27:31.539 --> 03:27:32.640
WORKING IN.

03:27:32.706 --> 03:27:33.641
IN -- IN

03:27:33.707 --> 03:27:36.310
THERE RETAIL FAR LEARN ABOUT THE

03:27:36.377 --> 03:27:38.345
CONFLICT OF INTEREST RIGHT NOW

03:27:38.412 --> 03:27:40.047
WE WE REALLY HAVE ISSUES IN

03:27:40.114 --> 03:27:41.415
TERMS OF WHAT I PRESCRIBE IN

03:27:41.482 --> 03:27:42.983
TERMS OF THE MEDICATION.

03:27:43.050 --> 03:27:44.518
AND WHAT THE PATIENT ULTIMATELY

03:27:44.585 --> 03:27:46.387
IS PRESCRIBED IT'S EITHER DONE

03:27:46.453 --> 03:27:47.888
BY VIRTUE OF DEALS THAT ARE MADE

03:27:47.955 --> 03:27:49.857
WITH THE WITH THE PHARMACY OR

03:27:49.924 --> 03:27:51.258
THE PBM.

03:27:51.325 --> 03:27:52.293
OR WHAT HAVE YOU BUT I'M ALREADY

03:27:52.359 --> 03:27:53.928
HAVING ISSUES AND PATIENTS

03:27:53.994 --> 03:27:55.963
ALREADY VERY CONFUSED I GET MY

03:27:56.030 --> 03:27:57.398
PRESCRIPTION FOR MEDICATION.

03:27:57.464 --> 03:27:59.300
DELETE WITH WHAT WITH A AND

03:27:59.366 --> 03:28:00.501
ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE.

03:28:00.568 --> 03:28:02.336
AND I THINK THAT AND I THINK THE
