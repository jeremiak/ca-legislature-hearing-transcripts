FOR MANY DECADES IN THE STATE

00:48:14.791 --> 00:48:17.694
OF CALIFORNIA. THE POLICY WAS

00:48:17.761 --> 00:48:20.264
INFORMED AS FAR AS FORCING

00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:22.633

IT'S BEEN A GROWTH OF FUEL

00:48:29.273 --> 00:48:32.809
FILLER ENORMOUS. BUT NOW WITH

00:48:32.876 --> 00:48:33.910
THE GUN TO HAVE THESE LAST

00:48:33.977 --> 00:48:37.648
SEVERAL YEARS CATACLYSMIC FIRES.

00:48:37.714 --> 00:48:41.485
AS SUCH MAGNITUDE. LITTLE TOWN

00:48:41.551 --> 00:48:42.919

PEOPLE DIED. IN A FIRE IN NO

SMALL MEASURE BECAUSE OF

00:48:49.326 --> 00:48:50.494
POLICIES OF THE STATE OF

00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:51.695
CALIFORNIA AND THE FEDERAL

00:48:51.762 --> 00:48:55.732
GOVERNMENT. THE DID NOT ALLOW.

00:48:55.799 --> 00:48:58.302
THE MANAGER OF THOSE FORESTS

00:48:58.368 --> 00:49:00.904
AND WILDLANDS. SOME OF THAT

00:49:00.971 --> 00:49:03.140
NEEDS REMOVING TREES REMOVING

00:49:03.206 --> 00:49:06.310
BRUSH. AND ENHANCING THE

00:49:06.376 --> 00:49:09.279
HABITAT ONE THING THAT NOBODY

00:49:09.346 --> 00:49:11.448
EVER TALKS ABOUT RELATED TO

00:49:11.515 --> 00:49:14.718
THESE CATACLYSMIC FIRES. IS ITS

00:49:14.785 --> 00:49:17.954
IMPACT ON WILDLIFE. PROTECTING

00:49:18.021 --> 00:49:19.523
THOSE WHO OF STOOD SO STRONGLY

00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:22.259
AGAINST DOING ANYTHING THAT ARE

00:49:22.326 --> 00:49:24.861
FORCED IN WILDLANDS. THEY SEEM

00:49:24.928 --> 00:49:26.530
TO DISREGARD ALL OF THE

00:49:26.596 --> 00:49:28.732
CRITTERS THE ANIMALS. THERE IN

00:49:28.799 --> 00:49:32.035
THE FOURTH. BANISHED FIGURE

00:49:32.102 --> 00:49:33.503
LITTLE BLOOD HERE BECAUSE THIS

00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:35.906
DEEP IN MY HEART TWO YEARS AGO

00:49:35.972 --> 00:49:38.742
I TOOK SOME OF US TO TOUR THE

00:49:38.809 --> 00:49:42.612
PARADISE. TALKED ABOUT HOW THE

00:49:42.679 --> 00:49:46.583
FIRE DEVASTATED THAT COMMUNITY.

00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:47.984
AND ONE OF THE BACK ROADS WE

00:49:48.051 --> 00:49:52.155
CAME UPON A LARGE BORE. THERE

00:49:52.222 --> 00:49:52.689
ARE MANY UP THERE IN THOSE

00:49:52.756 --> 00:49:57.527
HEELS. HE BEEN BARBECUED. BUT

00:49:57.594 --> 00:49:59.062
NOT ON THE SPENT ON THAT

00:49:59.129 --> 00:50:02.265
TERRIBLE FIRE. NOW THAT'S KIND

00:50:02.332 --> 00:50:05.001
OF A HORROR STRICKEN THAT LOOK

00:50:05.068 --> 00:50:05.535
AT SUCH DEVASTATION OF AN

00:50:05.602 --> 00:50:08.271
ANIMAL. BUT IT'S APPROPRIATE

00:50:08.338 --> 00:50:10.974
BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS.

00:50:11.041 --> 00:50:13.210
TO OUR WILDLIFE AND THEN OUR

00:50:13.276 --> 00:50:17.414
FISH AS A DEVASTATED SOILS. A

00:50:17.481 --> 00:50:19.549
ROAD INTO OUR RIVERS AND OUR

00:50:19.616 --> 00:50:23.120
STREAMS. THIS IS A VERY

00:50:23.186 --> 00:50:25.956
POSITIVE STEP FORWARD. A VERY

00:50:26.022 --> 00:50:28.992
SIGNIFICANT STEP FOR MORE SAFE

00:50:29.059 --> 00:50:31.428
AND SANE FUTURE. AND IT'S GOING

00:50:31.495 --> 00:50:33.864
TO HELP URBAN AREAS TO URBAN

00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:35.165
LEGISLATORS MUCH DIDN'T PAY

00:50:35.232 --> 00:50:37.167
ATTENTION TO THIS OVER THE

00:50:37.234 --> 00:50:37.734
DECADES EITHER BECAUSE THEY

00:50:37.801 --> 00:50:40.303
WERE NOT AFFECTED. BUT NOW THEY

00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:41.772
ARE THESE FIRES HAVE BEEN

00:50:41.838 --> 00:50:44.241
CROUCHED ON OUR URBAN

00:50:44.307 --> 00:50:44.875
COMMUNITIES MARCHING RIGHT INTO

00:50:44.941 --> 00:50:47.511
THEM. ONE THAT I USED TO

00:50:47.577 --> 00:50:51.281
REPRESENT AND- SANTA ROSA.

00:50:51.348 --> 00:50:52.983
NEVER HAD FIRES LIKE THIS RIDE

00:50:53.049 --> 00:50:57.654
INTO TOWN. GOT A FIRE IN RED

00:50:57.721 --> 00:50:58.255
BLUFF RIGHT TO VERY NEAR WHERE

00:50:58.321 --> 00:51:04.294
WE LIVE. INTOWN IT IS TIME. AND

00:51:04.361 --> 00:51:06.897
I SALUTE THE TIME. AND I SALUTE

00:51:06.963 --> 00:51:10.400
TO CHANGE AND WE WILL BE BETTER

00:51:10.467 --> 00:51:12.469
IF WE ARE SAFER FROM THESE

00:51:12.536 --> 00:51:14.938
CATACLYSMIC FIRES WITH THE

00:51:15.005 --> 00:51:16.673
MANAGEMENT OF THESE FOR SOME

00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:18.408
WHILE LANCE AND THEY WILL OUR

00:51:18.475 --> 00:51:21.611
LANDS AND OUR ANIMALS AND OUR

00:51:21.678 --> 00:51:25.782
HUMANS. AND OUR HABITAT IN OUR

00:51:25.849 --> 00:51:27.384
RESOURCES. WILL BE MORE

00:51:27.451 --> 00:51:29.753
PRODUCTIVE. AND MORE HEALTHY

00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:32.956
AND MORE SAFE. THANK YOU CENTER

YOU VERY MUCH- HE DOES SENATOR-

00:51:48.171 --> 00:51:50.140
FROM READING IS SAID TO HIM

00:51:50.207 --> 00:51:53.343
THAT IS CORRECT. OF BECAUSE FOR

00:51:53.410 --> 00:51:54.511
A HUNDRED YEARS FIRE

00:51:54.578 --> 00:51:56.313
SUPPRESSION HAS BEEN THE ORDER

00:51:56.379 --> 00:51:58.415
OF THE DAY IN OUR STATE OF

00:51:58.482 --> 00:52:00.283
PEOPLE URBAN AND RURAL OF ALL

00:52:00.350 --> 00:52:02.285
PARTIES EVERYONE THAT WAS THE

00:52:02.352 --> 00:52:04.354
OPERATING THEORY. AND IT HAS

00:52:04.421 --> 00:52:06.189
BUTTED UP AGAINST CLIMATE

00:52:06.256 --> 00:52:08.425
CHANGE BECAUSE THE OTHER PART

00:52:08.492 --> 00:52:10.460
OF THE PARADISE STORY IS THE

00:52:10.527 --> 00:52:12.596
FACT THAT THAT FAR REMOVED AT

00:52:12.662 --> 00:52:15.098
SIXTY ACRES A MINUTE SIXTY

00:52:15.165 --> 00:52:17.200
ACRES A MINUTE. PEOPLE COULD

00:52:17.267 --> 00:52:19.169
NOT OUTRUN THAT FIRE AND I WAS

00:52:19.236 --> 00:52:20.770
THERE THREE DAYS AND SIX DAYS

00:52:20.837 --> 00:52:22.672
IN NINE DAYS AFTER THAT FIRE I

00:52:22.739 --> 00:52:26.009
SAW. THE DEMONSTRATION AND THE

00:52:26.076 --> 00:52:28.245
SIGNIFICANT THING ABOUT WHAT'S

00:52:28.311 --> 00:52:30.447
IN FRONT OF US IS THIS DOES

00:52:30.514 --> 00:52:34.217
EVERYTHING TAKES THE FIRST

00:52:34.284 --> 00:52:34.818
STEPS OF EVERYTHING WE NEED TO

00:52:34.885 --> 00:52:36.653
DO. OUR WHETHER IT'S HEARTENING

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:39.556
OF BUILDINGS. WHETHER IT'S A

00:52:39.623 --> 00:52:41.424
PRESCRIBED FIRE WEATHER RICH

00:52:41.491 --> 00:52:43.260
FUELS MANAGEMENT WHETHER IT'S

00:52:43.326 --> 00:52:46.096
RECOVERING- AND MORE

00:52:46.162 --> 00:52:47.531
IMPORTANTLY WHETHER IT'S

00:52:47.597 --> 00:52:48.999
WHETHER WE HAVE ENOUGH

00:52:49.065 --> 00:52:51.067
RESOURCES TO FIGHT THE FIRE.

00:52:51.134 --> 00:52:53.069
BECAUSE LAST AUGUST WELL ALL OF

00:52:53.136 --> 00:52:55.205
YOU WERE HERE STRUGGLING WITH

00:52:55.272 --> 00:52:57.107
THE END OF SESSION. I WAS AT

00:52:57.173 --> 00:52:59.009
HOME WITH A FIRE THAT BROKE OUT

00:52:59.075 --> 00:53:01.945
IN MY AREA THAT BURNED WITHIN

00:53:02.012 --> 00:53:04.114
TWO MILES OF MY HOUSE. IN A

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:07.484
COASTAL USUALLY FOGGY SEASIDE

00:53:07.551 --> 00:53:10.387
CITY WHERE THE RESOURCES WERE

00:53:10.453 --> 00:53:12.689
SO STRESSED IN THE STRAIGHT IN

00:53:12.756 --> 00:53:14.558
THE STATE THAT THAT FIRE WAS

00:53:14.624 --> 00:53:16.526
BURNING THROUGH RURAL

00:53:16.593 --> 00:53:19.496
RESIDENTIAL AREAS ON FOUGHT FOR

00:53:19.563 --> 00:53:21.231
THREE OR FOUR DAYS. IT GOT TO

00:53:21.298 --> 00:53:22.499
WITHIN TWO MILES OF THE CITY

00:53:22.566 --> 00:53:23.733
LIMITS AND WE JUST HAD THE CITY

00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:25.035
FIRE DEPARTMENT AT THE CITY

00:53:25.101 --> 00:53:27.537
LIMITS ONE BIG WIND AND IT WAS

00:53:27.604 --> 00:53:30.840
IN. A IN SO THE BIG QUESTION TO

00:53:30.907 --> 00:53:31.942
IS ONE THAT IS ADDRESSED BY

00:53:32.008 --> 00:53:33.510
THIS BOND IS HOW DO WE MAKE

00:53:33.577 --> 00:53:35.312
SURE WE HAVE THE RESOURCES SO

00:53:35.378 --> 00:53:37.480
WE ARE NOT STRETCHED THAT WAY

00:53:37.547 --> 00:53:39.883
AGAIN. AND ALL THESE THINGS ARE

00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:41.351
GOING TO BE THINGS THAT THIS IS

00:53:41.418 --> 00:53:43.620
THE FIRST STEP OFF. THIS IS THE

00:53:43.687 --> 00:53:46.122
NEWER NEWER NORMAL AND WE ARE

00:53:46.189 --> 00:53:47.490
GOING TO HAVE TO DO FUELS

00:53:47.557 --> 00:53:50.427
MANAGEMENT AND FORCE TREATMENT

00:53:50.493 --> 00:53:52.996
AND BUILDING HARDENING AND HAVE

00:53:53.063 --> 00:53:55.565
ENOUGH RESOURCES. TO DEAL WITH

00:53:55.632 --> 00:53:57.000
THE FIRE INSURANCE PROBLEM

00:53:57.067 --> 00:53:59.736
BECAUSE THEY WERE SEVENTY SEVEN

00:53:59.803 --> 00:54:00.337
THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE COUNTY

00:54:00.403 --> 00:54:02.472
OF TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY

00:54:02.539 --> 00:54:03.039
THIRTY THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE

00:54:03.106 --> 00:54:04.741
WERE EVACUATED. AND WHEN THAT

00:54:04.808 --> 00:54:06.610
HAPPENED MANY OF RETURN HOME TO

FRESNO'S REMARKS ABOUT BEING.

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:25.041
COMMENSURATE WITH THE SCALE OF

01:02:25.108 --> 01:02:26.209
THE CHALLENGE WE HEARD

01:02:26.275 --> 01:02:28.111
TESTIMONY EARLIER THIS YEAR

01:02:28.177 --> 01:02:30.113
THAT THE LIABILITY TO THE STATE

01:02:30.179 --> 01:02:31.747
OF CALIFORNIA FOR THE TWO

01:02:31.814 --> 01:02:33.950
MILLION PEOPLE LIVING. DIRECTLY

01:02:34.016 --> 01:02:36.319
IN THE WILD FIRE ZONES COULD BE

01:02:36.385 --> 01:02:38.488
OVER A TRILLION DOLLARS. THAT'S

01:02:38.554 --> 01:02:41.190
WITH A T. TODAY WERE PASSING A

01:02:41.257 --> 01:02:43.693
MEASURE THAT WILL PUT FORWARD

01:02:43.759 --> 01:02:45.728
ALMOST HALF A BILLION DOLLARS

01:02:45.795 --> 01:02:47.497
AND IS THE PRO TEM IS RIGHTLY

01:02:47.563 --> 01:02:49.265
POINTED OUT FOR EVERY DOLLAR WE

01:02:49.332 --> 01:02:51.934
SPEND ON THESE EFFORTS WE SAVE

01:02:52.001 --> 01:02:52.935
SIXTY SEVEN DOLLARS ON THE BACK

01:02:53.002 --> 01:02:55.238
AND- SO WITH THIS ACT TODAY I

01:02:55.304 --> 01:02:56.472
THINK WE'LL BE SAVING. THE

01:02:56.539 --> 01:02:58.708
STATE OF CALIFORNIA SOMEWHERE

01:02:58.774 --> 01:03:00.576
AROUND THREE BILLION DOLLARS

01:03:00.643 --> 01:03:02.378
OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS WHICH

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:06.349
IS A HUGE HUGE COST SAVINGS NOT

01:03:06.415 --> 01:03:06.983
JUST FINANCIALLY BUT FOR

01:03:07.049 --> 01:03:10.086
PEOPLE'S LIVES. BUT I WANT TO I

01:03:10.153 --> 01:03:11.988
WANT TO STATE TO YOU ALL THAT

01:03:12.054 --> 01:03:14.657
THIS IS GOING TO. CAN CAN YOU

01:03:14.724 --> 01:03:16.626
TO REQUIRE SUSTAINED INVESTMENT

01:03:16.692 --> 01:03:18.127
AT A SCALE THAT I DON'T THINK

01:03:18.194 --> 01:03:19.462
WE CAN QUITE IMAGINE AT THIS

01:03:19.529 --> 01:03:22.899
POINT- A TRILLION DOLLAR

01:03:22.965 --> 01:03:24.267
LIABILITY NOT JUST FOR

01:03:24.333 --> 01:03:26.903
HOMEOWNERS LIVING. IN CANYONS

01:03:26.969 --> 01:03:29.438
AND HILLSIDES IN RURAL AREAS

01:03:29.505 --> 01:03:30.273
THAT THAT YOU MAY NOT

01:03:30.339 --> 01:03:32.375
REPRESENT. BUT THE WILDFIRE

01:03:32.441 --> 01:03:34.777
SMOKE IN THE IMPACT OF THESE

01:03:34.844 --> 01:03:38.981
EVENTS ON PREMATURE BIRTHS ON

01:03:39.048 --> 01:03:41.951
SEVERE ASTHMA. ON EXTREME

01:03:42.018 --> 01:03:44.220
RESPIRATORY ILLNESS AND EVEN

01:03:44.287 --> 01:03:45.588
NOW ACCORDING TO A NEW STUDY BY

01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:48.024
STANFORD LAST MONTH. THE WILD

01:03:48.090 --> 01:03:49.725
FIRES WE HAD LAST WINTER WILL

01:03:49.792 --> 01:03:51.527
PERMANENTLY AFFECT THE GENETICS

01:03:51.594 --> 01:03:52.962
OF NEWBORN BABIES BORN

01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:54.363
EVERYWHERE THROUGHOUT

01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:56.098
CALIFORNIA THAT WAS EXPOSED TO

01:03:56.165 --> 01:03:58.301
WILDFIRE SMOKE THE MOST TOXIC

01:03:58.367 --> 01:04:00.303
SORT. SO THIS IS NOT JUST A

01:04:00.369 --> 01:04:02.371
WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE ISSUE

01:04:02.438 --> 01:04:03.406
THIS IS AN ISSUE FOR ALL

01:04:03.472 --> 01:04:05.308
CALIFORNIANS WHICH IS WHY THIS

01:04:05.374 --> 01:04:06.576
MEASURE I BELIEVE IS SO

01:04:06.642 --> 01:04:09.045
IMPORTANT HERE TODAY- BUT IT IS

01:04:09.111 --> 01:04:11.681
JUST THE FIRST STEP TRULY. THE

01:04:11.747 --> 01:04:12.782
TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR

01:04:12.848 --> 01:04:14.750
EXAMPLE FOR HOME HARDENING WILL

01:04:14.817 --> 01:04:16.219
COVER ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND

01:04:16.285 --> 01:04:18.087
HOMES THAT'S LESS THAN 1% OF

01:04:18.154 --> 01:04:19.989
THE TOTAL PROBLEM. SO WE HAVE

01:04:20.056 --> 01:04:21.691
OUR WORK CUT OUT FOR US HERE

01:04:21.757 --> 01:04:23.459
BUT- WE'RE STARTING TO HONE IN

01:04:23.526 --> 01:04:25.828
ON THE ISSUE AND THE FACT THAT

01:04:25.895 --> 01:04:26.829
WE'VE NOW REALIZED THAT

01:04:26.896 --> 01:04:28.464
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAS UNIQUE

01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:30.333

WERE ONE SPARK CAN BURN A HOLE

01:04:37.106 --> 01:04:38.641
COMMUNITY DOWN. IT IT'S ABOUT
