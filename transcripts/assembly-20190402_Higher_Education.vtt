00:48:46.657 --> 00:48:47.658
A SMALL.

00:48:47.724 --> 00:48:51.261

MOST LIKELY BUT I HAVE A CURIOUS --

00:49:25.662 --> 00:49:26.897
QUESTION I I KNOW THIS IS A

00:49:26.963 --> 00:49:28.532
COMMON PRACTICE ABOUT THE

00:49:28.598 --> 00:49:31.368
REQUIRING HUNDRED SIGNATURES SO

00:49:31.435 --> 00:49:33.170
WHEN NOT REQUIRING.

00:49:33.236 --> 00:49:34.404
WHAT DIFFERENCES HAVE DOES A

00:49:34.471 --> 00:49:36.740
MAKE UP I NóI -- THEY

00:49:36.807 --> 00:49:38.108
EXPERIENCE A CANDIDATE THE

00:49:38.175 --> 00:49:40.143
COLLECTING THE SIGNATURES IS

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:41.011
ADJUSTABLE.

00:49:41.078 --> 00:49:44.014
PAIN IN ALL BUT THAT DOESN'T

00:49:44.081 --> 00:49:46.550
DETER -- FROM THAT SERIOUS A

00:49:46.616 --> 00:49:48.151
CANDIDATE TO COLLECT THEM BUT

00:49:48.218 --> 00:49:49.953
WHAT THE ANY ON SIRIUS PEOPLE

00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:51.521
BECAUSE OF WHAT THIS --

00:49:51.588 --> 00:49:54.257
REQUIREMENT -- THE THE NEVER

00:49:54.324 --> 00:49:55.759
FILED OUT WHAT WHAT IS A STACK

00:49:55.826 --> 00:49:58.528
THE PURPOSE OF REQUIRING THIS A

00:49:58.595 --> 00:50:05.202
SIGNATURE SAID NOW SO.

00:50:05.268 --> 00:50:06.970
IN ALL MY QUESTION.

00:50:07.037 --> 00:50:08.438
THIS IS TO SHOW THAT THAT --

00:50:08.505 --> 00:50:09.239
POTENTIAL CANDIDATE ACTUALLY

00:50:09.306 --> 00:50:10.340
HAVE SUPPORT SUPPORT IN THE AREA

00:50:10.407 --> 00:50:12.142
TO LOOKING TO REPRESENT -- IT'S

00:50:12.209 --> 00:50:12.743
NOT AND DO BURDEN WE HAVE TO

THE LEGISLATIVE SEATS -- BUT IT

00:50:16.513 --> 00:50:17.581
IS A SENSE OF MAKING SURE THAT

00:50:17.647 --> 00:50:19.082
THESE ARE NOT FOLKS -- TO TO

00:50:19.149 --> 00:50:20.450
SORT OF JUMP IN -- TO RACE BUT

00:50:20.517 --> 00:50:21.985
THEY HAVE SOME DEMONSTRATED

00:50:22.052 --> 00:50:23.153
ABILITY TO TELL AT LEAST A

FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible]

00:50:45.742 --> 00:50:46.877
HAVING BEEN A COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:50:46.943 --> 00:50:49.746
CHRISTY MYSELF I THINK THAT ONE

00:50:49.813 --> 00:50:51.314
HUNDRED SIGNATURES IS A VERY

00:50:51.381 --> 00:50:52.449
GOOD IDEA.

00:50:52.516 --> 00:50:55.419
I'VE SEEN IN MY OWN DISTRICT --

00:50:55.485 --> 00:50:57.187

AND SO -- HUNDRED SIGNATURES I

00:51:08.031 --> 00:51:09.666

00:51:09.733 --> 00:51:11.134
KIND OF THINGS FROM HAPPENING.

00:51:11.201 --> 00:51:13.403

HOUSING AND FOOD AND SECURITY

00:52:39.055 --> 00:52:40.390
AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS ALSO

00:52:40.457 --> 00:52:41.625
KNOWN AS BASIC NEEDS AND

00:52:41.691 --> 00:52:42.592
SECURITY.

00:52:42.659 --> 00:52:44.227
IS FINALLY GETTING THE ATTENTION

00:52:44.294 --> 00:52:45.262
IT DESERVES.

00:52:45.328 --> 00:52:46.630
STUDENTS OF COLOR FIRST

00:52:46.696 --> 00:52:47.864
GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS

00:52:47.931 --> 00:52:49.566
FINANCIAL AID RECIPIENTS AND

00:52:49.633 --> 00:52:51.201
FORMER FOSTER YOUTH ARE AT MUCH

00:52:51.268 --> 00:52:53.169
HIGHER RISK OF EXPERIENCING

00:52:53.236 --> 00:52:54.704
BASIC NEEDS AND SECURITY.

00:52:54.771 --> 00:52:56.406
THE MOST EXTREME FORM OF HOUSING

00:52:56.473 --> 00:52:57.774
AND SECURITY IS HOMELESSNESS

00:52:57.841 --> 00:53:00.911
THEN AT IT HAS A DIRECT IMPACT

00:53:00.977 --> 00:53:01.444
ON THE STUDENT'S ACADEMIC

00:53:01.511 --> 00:53:02.012
SUCCESS.

00:53:02.078 --> 00:53:03.179
A RECENT REPORT RELEASED BY THE

00:53:03.246 --> 00:53:04.614
CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES

00:53:04.681 --> 00:53:06.283
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IN THE HOPE

00:53:06.349 --> 00:53:07.984
CENTER FOR COLLEGE COMMUNITY AND

00:53:08.051 --> 00:53:09.052
JUSTICE.

00:53:09.119 --> 00:53:10.587
WHICH SURVEYED NEARLY FORTY

00:53:10.654 --> 00:53:12.188
THOUSAND STUDENTS AT FIFTY SEVEN

00:53:12.255 --> 00:53:14.224
COMMUNITY COLLEGES FOUND THAT

00:53:14.291 --> 00:53:16.226
19% OF RESPONDENTS EXPERIENCED

00:53:16.293 --> 00:53:19.429
HOMELESSNESS IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

00:53:19.496 --> 00:53:20.463
IF YOU EXTRAPOLATE THAT TO

00:53:20.530 --> 00:53:21.698
CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:53:21.765 --> 00:53:23.366
POPULATION OF TWO POINT ONE

00:53:23.433 --> 00:53:24.634
MILLION STUDENTS.

00:53:24.701 --> 00:53:27.037
THIS MEANS THAT BARELY LESS THAN

00:53:27.103 --> 00:53:27.637
FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS

00:53:27.704 --> 00:53:29.806
STATEWIDE HAVE EXPERIENCE

00:53:29.873 --> 00:53:31.274
HOMELESSNESS IN THE LAST YEAR.

00:53:31.341 --> 00:53:32.576
THIS NUMBER IS NOT ONLY SHOCKING

00:53:32.642 --> 00:53:34.844
AN ALARMING AND TRAGIC BUT IT'S

00:53:34.911 --> 00:53:36.146
A CALL TO ACTION.

00:53:36.212 --> 00:53:38.448
THIS IS WHY I INTRODUCED AB

00:53:38.515 --> 00:53:39.082
THREE OH TWO WHICH WOULD REQUIRE

00:53:39.149 --> 00:53:40.517
COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO GRANT

00:53:40.584 --> 00:53:42.018
OVERNIGHT ACCESS TO THE PARKING

00:53:42.085 --> 00:53:44.387
FACILITIES FOR HOMELESS STUDENTS

00:53:44.454 --> 00:53:45.855
TO SLEEP IN THEIR VEHICLES.

00:53:45.922 --> 00:53:47.324
EXISTING LAW ALREADY REQUIRES

00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:48.792
COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO GRANT

00:53:48.858 --> 00:53:50.627
HOMELESS STUDENTS ACCESS TO

00:53:50.694 --> 00:53:52.162
CAMPUS SHOWER FACILITIES.

00:53:52.228 --> 00:53:53.496
THIS BILL IS THE NEXT LOGICAL

00:53:53.563 --> 00:53:55.198
STEP IN HELPING OUR HOMELESS

00:53:55.265 --> 00:53:56.499
STUDENTS.

00:53:56.566 --> 00:53:58.034
UNDER AB THREE OR TWO EACH

00:53:58.101 --> 00:53:59.703
COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT WILL

00:53:59.769 --> 00:54:01.438
BE PROVIDED BROAD FLEXIBILITY TO

00:54:01.504 --> 00:54:02.706
DEVELOPING AN IMPLEMENTATION

00:54:02.772 --> 00:54:04.541
PLAN THAT MEETS THE LOCAL NEEDS

00:54:04.608 --> 00:54:05.842
AND CIRCUMSTANCES.

00:54:05.909 --> 00:54:07.510
AB THREE OH TWO ALSO IMPORTANTLY

00:54:07.577 --> 00:54:09.112
SPECIFIES THAT IT IS THE INTENT

00:54:09.179 --> 00:54:11.014
OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT HOMELESS

00:54:11.081 --> 00:54:12.082
STUDENTS TO USE THE OVERNIGHT

00:54:12.148 --> 00:54:14.084
PARKING FACILITIES THE CONNECTED

00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:15.418
TO AVAILABLE STATE.

00:54:15.485 --> 00:54:17.253
COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:18.888

00:54:21.491 --> 00:54:22.692
ASSISTANCE RESOURCES.

00:54:22.759 --> 00:54:24.361
THE GOAL ISN'T TO TO HAVE

00:54:24.427 --> 00:54:25.729
COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS OR

00:54:25.795 --> 00:54:27.230
REALLY ANYBODY SLEEP IN THEIR

00:54:27.297 --> 00:54:28.398
VEHICLES.

00:54:28.465 --> 00:54:29.299
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE

01:09:39.341 --> 01:09:41.110
WAY TO DEAL WITH THAT.

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:42.177

MEMBER BERMAN -- FOR BRINGING

01:10:22.985 --> 01:10:24.086
THIS BILL I THINK IT ADDRESSES A

01:10:24.153 --> 01:10:26.589
VERY -- IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT WE

01:10:26.655 --> 01:10:28.223
HAVEN'T.

01:10:28.290 --> 01:10:30.960
SPENT ENOUGH TIME -- THINKING

01:10:31.026 --> 01:10:32.995
THROUGH -- I SHARE A LOT OF THE

01:10:33.062 --> 01:10:35.130
CONCERNS OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER --

01:10:35.197 --> 01:10:36.999
WHEN -- I'M GONNA REACH A

01:10:37.066 --> 01:10:39.335
DIFFERENT RESULT HERE TODAY AND

01:10:39.401 --> 01:10:42.071
RESERVE -- MY THINKING ON THE

01:10:42.137 --> 01:10:45.407
BILL UNTIL -- IT COMES TO THE

01:10:45.474 --> 01:10:48.611
FLOOR -- A SEWER -- TAKING A

01:10:48.677 --> 01:10:49.945
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT APPROACH BUT

01:10:50.012 --> 01:10:53.349
I THINK THAT MY CONCERNS ARE

01:10:53.415 --> 01:10:54.683
VERY MUCH REFLECTED IN THE

01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:55.884
LETTER THAT YOU RECEIVED.

01:10:55.951 --> 01:10:57.686
FROM SANTA MONICA COLLEGE RIGHT

01:10:57.753 --> 01:10:59.455
I DO BELIEVE THAT -- WE SHOULD

01:10:59.521 --> 01:11:00.589
START THIS PROGRAM AS A

01:11:00.656 --> 01:11:03.392
PERMISSIVE PROGRAM NOT AS A

01:11:03.459 --> 01:11:05.194
MANDATE -- I THINK THAT THERE

01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:07.529
ARE SOME -- OTHER CONCERNS THAT

01:11:07.596 --> 01:11:10.466
ARE IN IN THE LETTER BUT

01:11:10.532 --> 01:11:12.234
STARTING SOMETHING IS A AS A

01:11:12.301 --> 01:11:13.869
PILOT WITH A SUNSET SO THAT WE

01:11:13.936 --> 01:11:15.270
CAN LOOK BACK SEE HOW IT'S

01:11:15.337 --> 01:11:17.473
WORKING TO ME SEEMS SO.

01:11:17.539 --> 01:11:19.775
REALLY IMPORTANT HERE.

01:11:19.842 --> 01:11:23.879
THIS IS SOMETHING OF A YEAR --

01:11:23.946 --> 01:11:25.247
YOU'RE KIND OF ASKING TOOK UP

01:11:25.314 --> 01:11:28.283
PUT A SQUARE PEG IN A ROUND HOLE --

01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:31.020
THIS IS NOT THE HOUSING STUDENTS

01:11:31.086 --> 01:11:33.622
IS NOT A CORE FUNCTION OF OF OUR

01:11:33.689 --> 01:11:35.924
COMMUNITY COLLEGES I THINK IT

01:11:35.991 --> 01:11:37.459
SHOULD BE FRANKLY I THINK THAT

01:11:37.526 --> 01:11:39.028
COMMUNITY COLLEGES SHOULD BE.

01:11:39.094 --> 01:11:42.698
PROVIDING HOUSING -- BUT I HAVE

01:11:42.765 --> 01:11:45.534
TO SAY -- THIS ALSO ISN'T REALLY

01:11:45.601 --> 01:11:49.271
HOUSING -- WERE PROVIDING -- UP

01:11:49.338 --> 01:11:52.875
A PLACE TO PARK A VEHICLE OF I

01:11:52.941 --> 01:11:56.245
GET VERY UNEASY.

01:11:56.311 --> 01:11:59.581
WITH PROGRAMS LIKE THIS -- AND

01:11:59.648 --> 01:12:01.150
THE REASON I GET UNEASY IS

01:12:01.216 --> 01:12:05.954
BECAUSE A AN AUTOMOBILE -- IS A

01:12:06.021 --> 01:12:09.558
SUB STANDARD PLACE TO LIVE --

01:12:09.625 --> 01:12:13.228
AND WHEN GOVERNMENT -- STEPS IN

01:12:13.295 --> 01:12:16.331
AND SAYS IT'S OKAY -- UNDER

01:12:16.398 --> 01:12:18.133
THESE CIRCUMSTANCES AND WILL

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:20.335
PROVIDE A PLACE -- BECAUSE THE

01:12:20.402 --> 01:12:23.305
CRISIS IS SO BAD -- WE BEGIN TO

01:12:23.372 --> 01:12:26.875
NORMALIZE THAT AND I THINK IT

01:12:26.942 --> 01:12:29.478
JUST HAS -- IN IN MY EXPERIENCE

01:12:29.545 --> 01:12:30.846
IN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE LIKE

01:12:30.913 --> 01:12:33.215
YOU FOR A LONG TIME FOR ME IT'S

01:12:33.282 --> 01:12:36.585
WELL IN EXCESS OF THIRTY YEARS

01:12:36.652 --> 01:12:39.388
NOW A LITTLE LONGER THAN I HAVE --

01:12:39.455 --> 01:12:41.924
IT GET -- TO I I I I'VE JUST

01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:43.525
I'VE I'VE BEEN DISTRESSED TO

01:12:43.592 --> 01:12:46.095
FIND THE HOMELESSNESS HAS GOTTEN

01:12:46.161 --> 01:12:48.430
WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE -- AS

01:12:48.497 --> 01:12:51.600
WE'VE ALLOWED -- THROUGH CONSENT

01:12:51.667 --> 01:12:53.836
DECREES AND OTHER MEANS --

01:12:53.902 --> 01:12:55.404
PEOPLE TO SET UP TENTS AND LIVE

01:12:55.471 --> 01:12:58.107
ON SIDEWALKS -- I BELIEVE WE'VE

01:12:58.173 --> 01:12:59.942
NORMALIZE THAT BEHAVIOR AND

01:13:00.008 --> 01:13:02.811
WE'VE BECOME MORE INURED TO IT

01:13:02.878 --> 01:13:06.115
AND TO AND THAT'S NOT GOOD NOW I

01:13:06.181 --> 01:13:08.684
SEE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISSUE --

01:13:08.751 --> 01:13:10.419
TOO WHICH IS THAT WE HAVE A

01:13:10.486 --> 01:13:14.623
GROWING HOMELESS POPULATION AND

01:13:14.690 --> 01:13:16.291
EVEN THOUGH WE'RE HOUSING MORE

01:13:16.358 --> 01:13:17.893
PEOPLE THAN WE EVER HAVE BEFORE

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:19.228
LARGELY BECAUSE OF THE HOUSING

01:13:19.294 --> 01:13:21.330
CRISIS IN BECAUSE OF RISING

01:13:21.396 --> 01:13:23.599
SUBSTANCE ABUSE FIRST FOR THE

01:13:23.665 --> 01:13:25.400
WITH SOME A VERY VERY DANGEROUS

01:13:25.467 --> 01:13:29.638
CHEMICALS -- AND AND BECAUSE OF

01:13:29.705 --> 01:13:31.406
INCREASING MENTAL ILLNESS WE SEE

01:13:31.473 --> 01:13:33.842
THE POPULATION NOT BEING EVEN TO

01:13:33.909 --> 01:13:36.211
ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH OUR STRIDES

01:13:36.278 --> 01:13:37.946
IN PROVIDING HOUSING SO THERE

01:13:38.013 --> 01:13:39.314
THERE'S THERE'S DEFINITELY

01:13:39.381 --> 01:13:41.850
MULTIPLE SITES TO THIS BUT I I

01:13:41.917 --> 01:13:42.751

01:13:44.853 --> 01:13:45.053
WE SHOULD.

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:48.490
NEVER -- THINK ABOUT A PROGRAM

LIKE THIS AS PROVIDING OF ANY

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:53.428
KIND OF A LONG TERM SOLUTION

01:13:53.495 --> 01:13:54.997
WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT

01:13:55.063 --> 01:13:56.231
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE A

01:13:56.298 --> 01:13:58.767
SUNSET WE START SOMETHING LIKE

01:13:58.834 --> 01:14:02.004

WITH OUR HOMELESS COMMUNITY

01:15:32.728 --> 01:15:34.630
COLLEGE STUDENTS -- I THINK IT'S

01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:41.536
THE BILL DOES SAY THAT IT'S

01:15:41.603 --> 01:15:43.138
INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT

01:15:43.205 --> 01:15:44.740

SUBSTANCE ABUSE -- GONNA ISN'T

01:16:05.894 --> 01:16:07.429
SIGNIFICANT ISSUE AND I ALSO

01:16:07.496 --> 01:16:12.334
WOULD WOULD POINT OUT -- THAT --

01:16:12.401 --> 01:16:14.403
USED TO AGE TWENTY FIVE THAT IS

01:16:14.469 --> 01:16:16.405
THE PERIOD OF TIME -- WHEN YOUNG

01:16:16.471 --> 01:16:18.440
PEOPLE FREQUENTLY HAVE THEIR

01:16:18.507 --> 01:16:21.910
FIRST PSYCHOLOGICAL BREAKING --

01:16:21.977 --> 01:16:24.579
AND END UP IN CRISIS SO -- THOSE

01:16:24.646 --> 01:16:27.849
KIND OF SERVICES ARE -- NOT --

01:16:27.916 --> 01:16:29.751
MINOR THINGS IN MY OPINION THERE

01:16:29.818 --> 01:16:32.120
CRITICAL ABSOLUTELY I TOTALLY

01:16:32.187 --> 01:16:33.488
AGREE AND I DON'T KNOW IF.

01:16:33.555 --> 01:16:35.624
THEY'RE OR ANTHONY IF EITHER YOU

01:16:35.691 --> 01:16:37.059
YOU WANTED YEAH I'D LIKE TO

01:16:37.125 --> 01:16:45.067
ADDRESS THAT -- SO ONE OF THE

01:16:45.133 --> 01:16:47.402
THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO SAY JUST

01:16:47.469 --> 01:16:49.071
IN GENERAL -- TO MISTER WHEN MR

01:16:49.137 --> 01:16:49.905
BLOOM BUT WHEN WE RAISE SOME OF

01:16:49.972 --> 01:16:50.906
THE ISSUES AS FAR AS THE SAFETY

01:16:50.973 --> 01:16:51.573
YOU KNOW THE DRUG ABUSE ISSUES

01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:52.507
THAT THAT COULD BE PRESENT IN

01:16:52.574 --> 01:16:53.141
THE COMMUNITY.

01:16:53.208 --> 01:16:54.042
I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WERE

01:16:54.109 --> 01:16:54.710
FOR THIS IS A STUDENT CENTRIC --

01:16:54.776 --> 01:16:55.544
BILL WE LOOK AT THE STUDENT

01:16:55.610 --> 01:16:56.745
POPULATION THEY'VE MADE THAT

01:16:56.812 --> 01:16:57.813
INITIAL STEP TO TRY TO GET

01:16:57.879 --> 01:16:59.348
THEMSELVES IN HIGHER EDUCATION

01:16:59.414 --> 01:17:00.782
TO TRY TO GET THEMSELVES IN.

01:17:00.849 --> 01:17:01.984
OUT OF THE SITUATION AND TO

01:17:02.050 --> 01:17:03.485
BETTER THEIR LIVES.

01:17:03.552 --> 01:17:07.155
FROM THE MOST PART AND YOU KNOW

01:17:07.222 --> 01:17:08.323
I'VE INTERACTED WITH.

01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:09.124
IT COUNTLESS STUDENTS WHO HAVE

01:17:09.191 --> 01:17:10.459
BEEN IN THESE SITUATIONS.

01:17:10.525 --> 01:17:12.894
AND I WOULD SAY THAT DRUG ABUSE.

01:17:12.961 --> 01:17:14.162
I DON'T KNOW THAT IT IS AN ISSUE

01:17:14.229 --> 01:17:14.997
AND I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW WHEN

01:17:15.063 --> 01:17:16.164
YOU LOOK AT THE COLLEGE STUDENT

01:17:16.231 --> 01:17:17.632
COMMUNITY YEAH I MEAN WHEN YOU

01:17:17.699 --> 01:17:18.934
LOOK AT THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:17:19.001 --> 01:17:19.935
MOST VULNERABLE.

01:17:20.002 --> 01:17:21.403
MORE OFTEN THAN NOT IT IS THE

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:22.838
COST OF LIVING IT IS BEING ON

01:17:22.904 --> 01:17:24.239
THEIR OWN FOR THE FIRST TIME

01:17:24.306 --> 01:17:24.840
IT'S TRANSFERRING TO A SCHOOL

01:17:24.906 --> 01:17:26.008
OUT OF STATE.

01:17:26.074 --> 01:17:27.342
THAT LEADS THEM TO THE SITUATION

01:17:27.409 --> 01:17:28.643
WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT THE GENERAL

01:17:28.710 --> 01:17:30.245
HOMELESS POPULATION DRUG ABUSE

01:17:30.312 --> 01:17:31.313
ALCOHOL ABUSE MENTAL HEALTH

01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:32.347
ISSUES THOSE MIGHT BE THE MORE

01:17:32.414 --> 01:17:33.915
PREVALENT ISSUES WE TALK ABOUT

01:17:33.982 --> 01:17:35.250
THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY WHEN YOU

01:17:35.317 --> 01:17:36.551
TALK ABOUT THE STUDENT CENTRIC.

01:17:36.618 --> 01:17:37.953
MOST OF THE STUDENTS THEY MIGHT

01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:38.453
BE SUFFERING WITH MENTAL

01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:40.389
INSTABILITY SOME CERTAIN ISSUES

01:17:40.455 --> 01:17:41.323
BUT IT'S GONNA BE TO A FAR LESS

01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:41.957
EXTENT.

01:17:42.024 --> 01:17:43.125
AND WE CAN SAY THAT BECAUSE WHEN

01:17:43.191 --> 01:17:44.359
YOU LOOK AT THE STUDENTS THEY'RE

01:17:44.426 --> 01:17:45.794
GOING TO CLASSES IT'S INDICATIVE

01:17:45.861 --> 01:17:46.795
I'M NOT GONNA SIGN UP FOR

01:17:46.862 --> 01:17:48.563
CLASSES IF I'M YOU KNOW HAVING

01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:49.798
ALL THESE MENTAL ISSUES I'M

01:17:49.865 --> 01:17:52.034
PROBABLY NOT GONNA BE AS APT. TO

01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:53.001
ROLL INTO COLLEGE I'M HAVING A

01:17:53.068 --> 01:17:54.503
COULD BE AS APT TO YOU KNOW BE

01:17:54.569 --> 01:17:55.737
IN THAT SITUATION WHERE I'M

01:17:55.804 --> 01:17:56.671
TRYING TO BETTER MYSELF SO WE

01:17:56.738 --> 01:17:57.906
LOOK AT THOSE SITUATIONS I WOULD

01:17:57.973 --> 01:17:58.240
SAY.

01:17:58.306 --> 01:18:00.242
MOST OF THEM ARE JUST POOR

01:18:00.308 --> 01:18:02.411
CHOICES OR BEING OUT YOUNG AND

01:18:02.477 --> 01:18:05.213
ON THEIR OWN FOR THE FIRST TIME --

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:06.181
BUT THE STATE'S NOT SAYING YOU

01:18:06.248 --> 01:18:07.149
KNOW AS YOU SAID MR BLOOM IT'S

01:18:07.215 --> 01:18:08.850
NOT SAYING THAT IT'S OKAY TO BE

01:18:08.917 --> 01:18:10.352
HOMELESS I MEAN IT'S NOT

01:18:10.419 --> 01:18:11.887
NORMALIZING I WOULD SAY IT'S DE

01:18:11.953 --> 01:18:13.321
STIGMATIZING AND IF I WOULD HAVE

01:18:13.388 --> 01:18:14.156
KNOWN.

01:18:14.222 --> 01:18:15.157
THAT I COULD HAVE PARKED IN MY

01:18:15.223 --> 01:18:16.825
COLLEGE CAMPUS OVERNIGHT.

01:18:16.892 --> 01:18:19.394
I MEAN I I NEVER ONCE USED DRUGS --

01:18:19.461 --> 01:18:21.430
YOU KNOW THE ENTIRE TIME I WAS

01:18:21.496 --> 01:18:23.165
LIVING IN MY CAR I NEVER MET --

01:18:23.231 --> 01:18:24.633
ONE NEVER MET SOMEBODY.

01:18:24.699 --> 01:18:25.767
WHO IS IN A SIMILAR SITUATION WE

01:18:25.834 --> 01:18:27.235
ENDED UP IN A SITUATION BECAUSE

01:18:27.302 --> 01:18:28.837
OF DRUGS OR ALCOHOL OF TIMES?

01:18:28.904 --> 01:18:30.505
THE PEOPLE USE THEM ONCE YOU'RE

01:18:30.572 --> 01:18:31.106
IN THAT SITUATION TO NUMB THE

01:18:31.173 --> 01:18:31.706
PAIN.

01:18:31.773 --> 01:18:32.941
IT'S A PAINFUL SITUATION BEING

01:18:33.008 --> 01:18:34.543
HOMELESS BE AFRAID AT NIGHT KNOW

01:18:34.609 --> 01:18:35.777
THEM TO BE HARASSED I CAN

01:18:35.844 --> 01:18:36.778
UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW WANTED TO BE

01:18:36.845 --> 01:18:38.280
ABLE TO JUST GET A FEW HOURS OF

01:18:38.346 --> 01:18:39.181
SLEEP SO I YOU KNOW I MAYBE A

01:18:39.247 --> 01:18:40.015
DRINK WHAT ABOUT RIGHT TAKES

01:18:40.082 --> 01:18:40.282
MEDICINE.

01:18:40.348 --> 01:18:41.783
TRY TO GET YOU KNOW GET OUT OF

01:18:41.850 --> 01:18:43.518
THAT THAT FEELING OF DESPERATION

01:18:43.585 --> 01:18:44.419
THAT I HAVE BUT I WOULD SAY

01:18:44.486 --> 01:18:45.520
THAT'S NOT THE LEADING CAUSE OF

01:18:45.587 --> 01:18:46.655
THAT'S PROBABLY THAT'S MORE

01:18:46.721 --> 01:18:48.390
OFTEN THAT THE FACTOR THAT

01:18:48.457 --> 01:18:49.157
CONTRIBUTES TO BILLS PEOPLE

01:18:49.224 --> 01:18:50.192
USING THOSE.

01:18:50.258 --> 01:18:51.960
WERE ABUSING THE SUBSTANCES SO I

01:18:52.027 --> 01:18:53.728
WOULD SAY THAT THE STATE'S NOT

01:18:53.795 --> 01:18:58.300
REALLY SAYING THAT IT'S OKAY

01:18:58.366 --> 01:18:58.633
YOUR FOR YOU.

01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:00.635
YOU KNOW THIS IF THE ISSUE IS

01:19:00.702 --> 01:19:01.436
GOING TO GO AWAY.

01:19:01.503 --> 01:19:03.572
WHETHER WE PASS THIS BILL OR NOT

01:19:03.638 --> 01:19:04.973
COSTUMES ARE GONNA BE HOMELESS

01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:06.141
WE PASSED THE BILL QUESTIONS

01:19:06.208 --> 01:19:06.708
WILL CONTINUE TO BE HOMELESS

01:19:06.775 --> 01:19:07.642
WHAT THIS DOES IS IT PUTS

01:19:07.709 --> 01:19:08.176
SUPPORT IN PLACE FOR THE

01:19:08.243 --> 01:19:09.945
STUDENTS. TO WHO ARE STRUGGLING

01:19:10.011 --> 01:19:11.413
WHO DON'T KNOW WHERE TO TURN TO

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:12.013
BE ABLE TO SAY HEY WE HAVE AN

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:14.316
ACCESS FOR YOU TO GET YOU OUT OF

01:19:14.382 --> 01:19:15.417
THE SITUATION IT'S DEFINITELY

01:19:15.484 --> 01:19:16.918
DON'T WANT TO BE A PERMANENT

01:19:16.985 --> 01:19:18.220
SITUATION SOME PEOPLE ABUSE THAT

01:19:18.286 --> 01:19:19.321
THOSE LIVING APART RENT FREE

01:19:19.387 --> 01:19:20.255
IT'S CALIFORNIA IT'S EXPENSIVE.

01:19:20.322 --> 01:19:21.056
I DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND THAT

01:19:21.123 --> 01:19:21.957
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE STUDENTS

01:19:22.023 --> 01:19:23.725
FOR THE MOST PART THEY JUST WANT

01:19:23.792 --> 01:19:24.559
TO GET OUT OF THAT SITUATION.

01:19:24.626 --> 01:19:29.431
IF WE DON'T PUT A PROGRAM IN

01:19:29.498 --> 01:19:30.031
PLACE AND WHAT ARE WE OFFERING

01:19:30.098 --> 01:19:31.666
STUDENTS.

01:19:31.733 --> 01:19:32.667
YEAH IF I COULD HAVE A QUICK

01:19:32.734 --> 01:19:34.236
RESPONSE -- TO YOU KNOW I THINK

01:19:34.302 --> 01:19:35.003
THAT WORKING ON SIMULTANEOUSLY

01:19:35.070 --> 01:19:35.504
ON LONGER TERM HOUSING

01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:36.071
STRATEGIES WHILE EMPLOYING A

01:19:36.138 --> 01:19:38.907
HARM REDUCTION STRATEGY -- IS

01:19:38.974 --> 01:19:40.675
NOT A MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE GOAL I

01:19:40.742 --> 01:19:41.743
THINK WE CAN DO BOTH AT THE SAME

01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:42.744
TIME SO IT'S NOT SORT OF EITHER

01:19:42.811 --> 01:19:44.012
OR I DON'T THINK IT UNDERCUTS

01:19:44.079 --> 01:19:45.680
EFFORTS TO PROVIDE LONGER TERM

01:19:45.747 --> 01:19:46.848
HOUSING STRATEGIES.

01:19:46.915 --> 01:19:48.216
AND AT THIS BILL DOESN'T ALLOW

01:19:48.283 --> 01:19:49.117
STUDENTS TO SLEEP IN THEIR

01:19:49.184 --> 01:19:50.952
CARSTENS ARE ALREADY SLEEPING IN

01:19:51.019 --> 01:19:51.820
THEIR CARS IT ALLOWS AN OF A

01:19:51.887 --> 01:19:53.889
SAFE PLACE TO PARK AND I KNOW

01:19:53.955 --> 01:19:55.056
THAT JUST YOUR CONVERSATIONS

01:19:55.123 --> 01:19:56.291
WITH BOTH OF THE STUDENTS HERE.

01:19:56.358 --> 01:19:57.159
THEY TALKED ABOUT KIND OF

01:19:57.225 --> 01:19:59.161
NEGATIVE RAMIFICATIONS FROM THE

01:19:59.227 --> 01:20:00.762
COMMUNITY WHEN THEY DIDN'T HAVE

01:20:00.829 --> 01:20:01.997
A SAFE PLACE TO PARK AND FROM

01:20:02.063 --> 01:20:03.398
LAW ENFORCEMENT.

01:20:03.465 --> 01:20:04.533
AND SO THAT MADE IT YOU KNOW ODD

01:20:04.599 --> 01:20:05.800
A DIFFICULT SITUATION EVEN

01:20:05.867 --> 01:20:07.636
HARDER IT SORT OF ADDING INSULT

01:20:07.702 --> 01:20:09.304
TO INJURY WHEN NOT ONLY ARE THEY

01:20:09.371 --> 01:20:10.305
IN A SITUATION THEY HAVE TO BE

01:20:10.372 --> 01:20:11.106
SLEEPING THEIR CARBON THEY'RE

01:20:11.173 --> 01:20:12.207
ALSO EXPERIENCING.

01:20:12.274 --> 01:20:14.142
YOU KNOW THE KIND OF STIGMA AND

01:20:14.209 --> 01:20:15.644
TO BE IS -- FROM THE COMMUNITY

01:20:15.710 --> 01:20:17.946
ABOUT HAVING TO DO THAT SO I

01:20:18.013 --> 01:20:18.647
THINK WHILE WE WORK ON LONG TERM

01:20:18.713 --> 01:20:19.381
STRATEGIES.

01:20:19.447 --> 01:20:21.983
RECOGNIZING THAT THIS IS A

01:20:22.050 --> 01:20:23.685

LOWEST PAYING FOR THAT WE CAN

01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:31.593
POSSIBLY THINK OF AS IMMEDIATELY

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:33.695
AS POSSIBLE.

01:25:48.309 --> 01:25:50.111

THIS FORWARD YOU KNOW I DON'T.

01:26:06.027 --> 01:26:06.561
I DON'T THINK ANY OF US WOULD

01:26:06.628 --> 01:26:08.530
HAVE THOUGHT. SIX YEARS AGO NOW

01:26:08.596 --> 01:26:09.631
WHEN WE STARTED THE CAMPUS

01:26:09.697 --> 01:26:10.999
CLIMATE COMMITTEE THAT WE WOULD

01:26:11.065 --> 01:26:12.667
BE IN A POSITION OF DEALING WITH

01:26:12.734 --> 01:26:13.935
THESE KINDS OF ISSUES AS WELL AS

01:26:14.002 --> 01:26:15.470
THE OTHER ISSUES.

01:26:15.537 --> 01:26:17.338
BASED ON CAMPUSES -- BUT AS

01:26:17.405 --> 01:26:18.606
CHAIR THAT COMMITTEE BECAME VERY

01:26:18.673 --> 01:26:20.375
CLEAR THAT WE HAD NOT ONLY

01:26:20.441 --> 01:26:21.943
ISSUES OF RACE AND GENDER BUT

01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:23.444
ISSUES OF ECONOMIC ON OUR

01:26:23.511 --> 01:26:24.112
CAMPUSES.

01:26:24.178 --> 01:26:25.947
THAT HAD A THE ABILITY TO REALLY

01:26:26.014 --> 01:26:27.448
CHANGE THE CULTURE OF CAMPUSES

01:26:27.515 --> 01:26:29.017
AND MAKE THEM VERY DIFFERENT

01:26:29.083 --> 01:26:30.285
PLACES AND WE HAD ENVISIONED.

01:26:30.351 --> 01:26:32.153
BOB I'M VERY PROUD OF THE FACT

01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:33.421
THAT SO MANY OF OUR CAMPUSES OF

01:26:33.488 --> 01:26:35.156
TAKEN THE CHALLENGE OF TRYING TO

01:26:35.223 --> 01:26:36.090
MEET THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS IN

01:26:36.157 --> 01:26:38.393
TERMS OF ECONOMICS -- FOOD IN

01:26:38.459 --> 01:26:40.862
SECURITY HOUSING AND SECURITY

01:26:40.929 --> 01:26:42.630
YOU KNOW -- TAKING THE STIGMA

01:26:42.697 --> 01:26:44.098
OUT OF THE SO CALLED COUCH

01:26:44.165 --> 01:26:46.134
SURFING CULTURE AND WHICH WAS A

01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:48.636
JOKE THAT IS A REALITY FOR SO

01:26:48.703 --> 01:26:50.638
MANY STUDENTS AS THEIR THIS IS

01:26:50.705 --> 01:26:51.973
NOT A PERFECT SOLUTION BUT WE

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:53.608
CAN IGNORE THE PROBLEM AND IF SO

01:26:53.675 --> 01:26:55.410
WE WILL HAVE EVEN MORE PROBLEMS

01:26:55.476 --> 01:26:57.078
THAN BEFORE -- WE SAW THAT IN

01:26:57.145 --> 01:26:58.813
SAN DIEGO WHEN WE TRIED TO

01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:00.782
IGNORE THE HOMELESS POPULATION

01:27:00.848 --> 01:27:02.350
AND ENDED UP WITH THIS HELP.

01:27:02.417 --> 01:27:03.484
EIGHT UP WE DIDN'T WANT TO

01:27:03.551 --> 01:27:05.086
PROVIDE RESTROOMS IN WANT TO

01:27:05.153 --> 01:27:06.487
PROVIDE WATER WE DIDN'T WANT TO

01:27:06.554 --> 01:27:07.255
PROVIDE CERTAIN THINGS

01:27:07.322 --> 01:27:08.623
INDIVIDUAL THINKING THAT THAT

01:27:08.690 --> 01:27:09.824
WOULD HELP THAT WOULD JUST GO

01:27:09.891 --> 01:27:11.159
AWAY THAT IF WE HAD.

01:27:11.225 --> 01:27:12.527
RESTROOMS AND WATER IN THOSE

01:27:12.594 --> 01:27:13.795
KINDS OF THINGS THAT SOMEONE OF

01:27:13.861 --> 01:27:14.228
THAT WOULD ENCOURAGE

01:27:14.295 --> 01:27:15.863
HOMELESSNESS AND KNOW WHAT IT

01:27:15.930 --> 01:27:17.432
DID WAS MAKE PEOPLE DO WHAT THEY

01:27:17.498 --> 01:27:19.000
HAD TO DO ALL OF THE CITY IN

01:27:19.067 --> 01:27:20.702
FACT EVERYBODY IN HAD PEOPLE

01:27:20.768 --> 01:27:22.036
DIED FROM HIP IT.

01:27:22.103 --> 01:27:23.605
AND SO WE REALIZED AT LEAST WE

01:27:23.671 --> 01:27:24.639
SHOULD HAVE THAT YOU CAN'T

01:27:24.706 --> 01:27:25.707
IGNORE THE PROBLEMS YOU HAVE

01:27:25.773 --> 01:27:27.475
PROGRESSIVELY FACE THEM THE BEST

01:27:27.542 --> 01:27:29.143
WAY YOU CAN AND THEN WORK TO

01:27:29.210 --> 01:27:29.777
MAKE SURE THOSE PROBLEMS DON'T

01:27:29.844 --> 01:27:30.478
COME BACK.

01:27:30.545 --> 01:27:31.613
WE HAVE A MAJOR PROBLEM

01:27:31.679 --> 01:27:32.580
OBVIOUSLY KNOCKED ME TO CALL

01:27:32.647 --> 01:27:33.848
JUST BECAUSE WE DON'T ADEQUATELY

01:27:33.915 --> 01:27:35.516
FUND STUDENTS TO GO TO COMMUNITY

01:27:35.583 --> 01:27:36.651
COLLEGE.

01:27:36.718 --> 01:27:37.552
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT AS THOUGH THE

01:27:37.619 --> 01:27:39.153
HOMELESS POPULATIONS WHICH

01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:40.655
GREATER THERE THAN IT IS AT SEA

01:27:40.722 --> 01:27:42.256
ISSUE AND YOU SEE BECAUSE THEY

01:27:42.323 --> 01:27:44.258
GET LARGER GRANTS TO PAY FOR

01:27:44.325 --> 01:27:46.494
HOUSING -- WE GIVE OUR COMMUNITY

01:27:46.561 --> 01:27:47.962
COLLEGE STUDENTS JUST THE MONEY

01:27:48.029 --> 01:27:49.631
FOR CLASSES AND BOOKS BUT WE

01:27:49.697 --> 01:27:52.000
DON'T WE DON'T FUND HOUSING --

01:27:52.066 --> 01:27:53.434
AND AND BECAUSE I SOME XIN IS

01:27:53.501 --> 01:27:54.702
THAT THESE ARE.

01:27:54.769 --> 01:27:55.903
A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN A HIGH

01:27:55.970 --> 01:27:56.738
SCHOOL GROUP OF FOLKS AND THEY

01:27:56.804 --> 01:27:57.805
STILL LIVING AT HOME WITH MOM

01:27:57.872 --> 01:27:58.940
AND DAD AND THE WORLD HAS

01:27:59.007 --> 01:28:00.274
CHANGED IN TERMS OF COMMUNITY

01:28:00.341 --> 01:28:01.175
COLLEGES.

01:28:01.242 --> 01:28:02.610
AND AS A RESULT WE HAVE MORE AND

01:28:02.677 --> 01:28:09.384
MORE STUDENTS AND OUR COMMUNITY

01:28:09.450 --> 01:28:11.552
IS A HIGHER PERCENTAGE THEN IT

01:28:11.619 --> 01:28:13.154
THEN AT C. ISSUE AND YOU SEE WHO

01:28:13.221 --> 01:28:13.755
ARE PRUDENT SECURE IN WHO ARE

01:28:13.821 --> 01:28:14.989
HOMELESS -- AND AND IT GOES BACK

01:28:15.056 --> 01:28:15.990
TO OUR OWN VISION OF WHAT WAS

01:28:16.057 --> 01:28:16.524
SUPPOSED TO BE DOING SO.

01:28:16.591 --> 01:28:18.059
I'M HOPING THAT IN THE PROCESS

01:28:18.126 --> 01:28:19.327
OF THIS.

01:28:19.394 --> 01:28:20.161
WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE IN AND

01:28:20.228 --> 01:28:20.895
AND IT'S POINTED OUT SAN DIEGO

01:28:20.962 --> 01:28:21.863
HAS THESE PLACES WHERE PEOPLE

01:28:21.929 --> 01:28:22.463
PART BECAUSE?

01:28:22.530 --> 01:28:23.531
WE DISCOVERED THAT THERE WERE

01:28:23.598 --> 01:28:24.732
PEOPLE WITH A MOBILE HOME PARK

01:28:24.799 --> 01:28:26.801
IN ALL OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS.

01:28:26.868 --> 01:28:27.835
YEAH YOU COME OUT IS A BIT MORE

01:28:27.902 --> 01:28:28.436
HOMELESS BEEN SIGNIFICANT RE

01:28:28.503 --> 01:28:30.338
DAYS BECAUSE THEY FIND THE CUL

01:28:30.405 --> 01:28:32.306
DE SAC THAT'S EMPTY AND IF IT IS

01:28:32.373 --> 01:28:33.741
ACTUALLY PEOPLE WHO WAS SLEEPING

01:28:33.808 --> 01:28:35.009
THERE THERE THAT THEY'VE.

01:28:35.076 --> 01:28:36.477
THEIR CAMPING THERE SO SAN DIEGO

01:28:36.544 --> 01:28:37.412
HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND

01:28:37.478 --> 01:28:38.880
WE CREATED THESE PLACES IN SOME

01:28:38.946 --> 01:28:39.947
CHURCHES HAVE PLACES WHERE

01:28:40.014 --> 01:28:41.082
PEOPLE PART.

01:28:41.149 --> 01:28:42.316
AND THEY PROVIDE SECURITY WE

01:28:42.383 --> 01:28:43.451
HAVEN'T HAD AN INCIDENT IN SO

01:28:43.518 --> 01:28:45.019
YOU CAN SOMETIMES SEE THAT AND

01:28:45.086 --> 01:28:46.320
IT'S A STOP GAP MEASURE WHERE

01:28:46.387 --> 01:28:47.255
YOU CAN AT LEAST PUT PEOPLE

01:28:47.321 --> 01:28:48.956
TOGETHER AND TRY TO WORK WITH

01:28:49.023 --> 01:28:49.891
THEM TO GET THE RESOURCES THEY

01:28:49.957 --> 01:28:52.026
NEED. TO GET THEM OUT OF THAT

01:28:52.093 --> 01:28:52.660
POSITION AND GET THEM BACK IN

01:28:52.727 --> 01:28:54.495
THE HOUSING VERY FEW PEOPLE WANT

01:28:54.562 --> 01:28:55.963
TO BE HOMELESS.

01:28:56.030 --> 01:28:57.131
AND YOU KNOW VERY FEW THERE ARE

01:28:57.198 --> 01:28:58.132
FEW WHO WHO WHO AS YOU PULL OUT

01:28:58.199 --> 01:29:00.301
BUT MOST FOLKS DON'T WANT THAT

01:29:00.368 --> 01:29:01.703
THEY WANT TO BE SECURE SO.

01:29:01.769 --> 01:29:02.970

ISSUES THAT OUR CAMPUSES HAVE --

01:29:06.074 --> 01:29:07.742
MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S SOME OF

01:29:07.809 --> 01:29:08.643
SAFETY IN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS

01:29:08.710 --> 01:29:12.513
BUT IF WE DON'T PASS THIS BILL.

01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:13.581
THEY WILL STILL BE HOMELESS.

01:29:13.648 --> 01:29:14.982
AND THEY WILL STILL BE TRYING TO

01:29:15.049 --> 01:29:16.284
FIGURE OUT HOW TO PARK THE CAR

01:29:16.350 --> 01:29:17.285
AND WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO AT

01:29:17.351 --> 01:29:18.653

01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:19.220
THEM IN ONE PLACE SO WE CAN

01:29:19.287 --> 01:29:20.121
BEGIN.

01:29:20.188 --> 01:29:21.389
TO TARGET THEM AND GET THE

01:29:21.456 --> 01:29:22.757

BECAUSE I I HAVE THEM IN THE

01:29:44.145 --> 01:29:44.912
AUTHOR I'VE TALKED IN THE PAST

01:29:44.979 --> 01:29:47.048

02:48:41.778 --> 02:48:43.513
WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IS

ESSENTIALLY REMOVE WAGES FROM

THEN THAT WOULD HAVE A VERY

02:48:51.321 --> 02:48:53.790
SERIOUS NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE

02:52:35.545 --> 02:52:37.714
OF A GREAT UNIVERSITY.

02:52:37.780 --> 02:52:39.248
THAT WOULD HAVE SUPPORT STAFF

02:52:39.315 --> 02:52:40.550
LIVING THE WAY THEY DO.

02:52:40.616 --> 02:52:42.351

ON THE FLOOR I'M GONNA PROBABLY

02:52:53.362 --> 02:52:55.064
AT LEAST KEEP TO THE FIRST

02:52:55.131 --> 02:52:56.132
PATTERN OF VOTING KNOWING

02:52:56.199 --> 02:52:58.334
COMMITTEE AT THIS POINT -- I

02:52:58.401 --> 02:53:00.737
APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND

02:53:00.803 --> 02:53:02.739
I WOULD LOVE TO HAND OUT RAISES

02:53:02.805 --> 02:53:04.474
THAT WOULD BE A FUN DAY EVERY

02:53:04.540 --> 02:53:07.043
DAY IN THIS JOB -- BUT THAT IS

02:53:07.110 --> 02:53:08.945
NOT WHAT WE DO YOU GUYS ENGAGE

02:53:09.011 --> 02:53:09.579
IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING I WOULD

02:53:09.645 --> 02:53:10.613
NEVER.

02:53:10.680 --> 02:53:12.348
TAKE SOMETHING AWAY THAT YOU

02:53:12.415 --> 02:53:13.649
GAIN IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING --

02:53:13.716 --> 02:53:15.218
OR TAKE SOMETHING AWAY FROM THE

02:53:15.284 --> 02:53:16.385
CSU THAT THEY HAD.

02:53:16.452 --> 02:53:18.254
DIED HAD RECEIVED IN COLLECTIVE

02:53:18.321 --> 02:53:19.589
BARGAINING SO IT'S IT'S AN

02:53:19.655 --> 02:53:21.591
AWKWARD SITUATION FOR US TO BE

02:53:21.657 --> 02:53:24.060
IN. TO T. PLACE IN THIS.

02:53:24.127 --> 02:53:25.595
SHOULD THERE BE.

02:53:25.661 --> 02:53:27.597
ECONOMIC MOBILITY FOR EMPLOYEES

02:53:27.663 --> 02:53:29.665
AND I I FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE

02:53:29.732 --> 02:53:30.967
THAT THERE SHOULD BE JUST AS WE

02:53:31.033 --> 02:53:32.201
HOPE THAT THERE IS ECONOMIC

02:53:32.268 --> 02:53:33.302
MOBILITY FOR STUDENTS IN THIS

02:53:33.369 --> 02:53:34.904
ISSUE I THINK FOR THE WORK FORCE

02:53:34.971 --> 02:53:36.272
THERE SHOULD BE AS WELL.

02:53:36.339 --> 02:53:37.540
SO I THINK WHAT I WOULD JUST ASK

02:53:37.607 --> 02:53:40.276
OF THE CSU IS TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:53:40.343 --> 02:53:41.077
I HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE

02:53:41.144 --> 02:53:42.545
INFORMATION AS THIS BILL MOVES

02:53:42.612 --> 02:53:44.313
FORWARD IF IT MOVES FORWARD --

02:53:44.380 --> 02:53:46.115
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAS BEEN

02:53:46.182 --> 02:53:47.383
GAINED AND LOST IN THE

02:53:47.450 --> 02:53:50.586
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS SO

02:53:50.653 --> 02:53:51.420
YOU KNOW WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT

02:53:51.487 --> 02:53:53.022
THIS IS HAPPENING WELL IF WE'RE

02:53:53.089 --> 02:53:54.257
GONNA BE ASKED TO REFEREE THIS.

02:53:54.323 --> 02:53:55.191
I JUST WANT TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT

02:53:55.258 --> 02:53:56.492
MORE INFORMATION BEFORE THIS

02:53:56.559 --> 02:53:58.027

ESPECIALLY THE POOREST PEOPLE

02:54:03.666 --> 02:54:04.600

INSTITUTION LIKE THIS YES YOU

WITH DIGNITY.

02:54:07.837 --> 02:54:12.508
AND AND SO I APPRECIATE THE THE

02:54:12.575 --> 02:54:14.443
EFFORT THAT YOU'RE PUTTING

02:54:14.510 --> 02:54:14.744
[inaudible]

02:54:14.811 --> 02:54:16.946
FOR DR JOY.

02:54:17.013 --> 02:54:18.247
I THOUGHT I'D GIVE THEM A CHANCE

02:54:18.314 --> 02:54:21.884

PAY INEQUITY I HEAR THE PROBLEM

02:54:32.528 --> 02:54:35.431
AND THE HOW WE CAN ADDRESS OF

02:54:35.498 --> 02:54:36.666
INTO US WHAT YOUR BILL IS ARE

02:54:36.732 --> 02:54:39.502
TRYING -- TO MAKE UP BUT TWO

02:54:39.569 --> 02:54:43.606
QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE IS THAT --

02:54:43.673 --> 02:54:44.907
HOW YOU GONNA MAKE UP BUT THE

02:54:44.974 --> 02:54:48.010
CURRENT -- INEQUITY SITUATION.

02:54:48.077 --> 02:54:50.746
FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE -- BUT

02:54:50.813 --> 02:54:53.549
LESS PAID THE WITH THE LONGER OR

02:54:53.616 --> 02:54:57.587
LONGEVITY.

02:54:57.653 --> 02:55:01.224
OF WHEN YOUR EMPLOYEES SAW.

02:55:01.290 --> 02:55:03.059
WITH THERE BE A CATCH UP A

02:55:03.125 --> 02:55:05.695
SPECIAL FUND.

02:55:05.761 --> 02:55:06.429
AND HOW MUCH OF THAT WOULD BE

02:55:06.495 --> 02:55:08.531
OUR FOR THE TWENTY THREE

02:55:08.598 --> 02:55:11.500
CAMPUSES SO CH CSU SYSTEM.

02:55:11.567 --> 02:55:15.438
NUMBER. TWO QUESTION IS THAT THE

02:55:15.504 --> 02:55:17.206
WHY IT IS SO OFTEN I MEAN I HAS

02:55:17.273 --> 02:55:20.309
HAPPENED IF THIS WAS THAT

02:55:20.376 --> 02:55:22.945
THROUGH THE OF COLLECTIVE

02:55:23.012 --> 02:55:28.050
BARGAINING -- NEGOTIATIONS.

02:55:28.117 --> 02:55:30.686
I'M I'M SURE THE I UNION GIVEN

02:55:30.753 --> 02:55:31.921
CERTAIN PERCENTAGE IF THERE'S A

02:55:31.988 --> 02:55:34.223
5% THE HOW THAT WOULD BE.

02:55:34.290 --> 02:55:37.760
ACTIVELY DISTRIBUTED.

02:55:37.827 --> 02:55:38.694
OUR AND THEN.

02:55:38.761 --> 02:55:40.963
THAT THE PEOPLE WHO.

02:55:41.030 --> 02:55:42.531
I HAVE BEEN WORKING THERE LONGER

02:55:42.598 --> 02:55:44.834
PERIOD.

02:55:44.901 --> 02:55:45.835
I SHOULD BEEN TAKEN CARE OF HOW

02:55:45.902 --> 02:55:47.904
WOULD.

02:55:47.970 --> 02:55:50.206
JUST A DISTRICT IN EQUITY HAS

02:55:50.273 --> 02:55:56.712
HAPPENED -- LET ME LET ME SAY

02:55:56.779 --> 02:55:58.080
FIRST OF ALL OF THEM.

02:55:58.147 --> 02:55:59.982
THE INVERSION ISSUE IS AN ISSUE

02:56:00.049 --> 02:56:01.217
THAT'S BEING ADDRESSED ANOTHER

02:56:01.284 --> 02:56:02.919
WAY IN PEOPLE'S MENTION HERE BUT

02:56:02.985 --> 02:56:05.054
THIS BILL IS NOT THE SOLUTION TO

02:56:05.121 --> 02:56:06.422
THE INVERSION FIRST OF ALL THAT

02:56:06.489 --> 02:56:08.224
WAS JUST MENTIONED SHOW YOU HOW

02:56:08.291 --> 02:56:09.392
BAD THINGS GOT.

02:56:09.458 --> 02:56:11.327
THIS BILL IS ABOUT RESTORING THE

02:56:11.394 --> 02:56:13.729
MERIT INCREASES OF THAT CAN

02:56:13.796 --> 02:56:16.232
HAPPEN FOR AN INDIVIDUAL -- AND

02:56:16.299 --> 02:56:17.533
IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND

02:56:17.600 --> 02:56:19.568
THAT WHILE WE GIVE PAY HOMMAGE

02:56:19.635 --> 02:56:21.003
TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING.

02:56:21.070 --> 02:56:23.139
AND I WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WAY

02:56:23.205 --> 02:56:24.607
BACK IN THE DAY WITH YOU P. C.

02:56:24.674 --> 02:56:26.475
AND THEN CFA THAT ACTUALLY GOT

02:56:26.542 --> 02:56:27.476
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IF THIS IF

02:56:27.543 --> 02:56:29.912
THIS ISSUE SYSTEM THAT WAS ONE

02:56:29.979 --> 02:56:30.780
OF THE THINGS I DID IN THE

02:56:30.846 --> 02:56:33.015
SEVENTIES -- BUT THIS WAS DONE

02:56:33.082 --> 02:56:34.650
OUTSIDE OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

02:56:34.717 --> 02:56:35.518
AND THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT

02:56:35.584 --> 02:56:36.852
UNDERSTAND IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT

02:56:36.919 --> 02:56:38.054
IF THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT HAVE

02:56:38.120 --> 02:56:39.488
BEEN COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN.

02:56:39.555 --> 02:56:41.524
NOW THE SYSTEM PAYS HOMMAGE TO

02:56:41.590 --> 02:56:43.025
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WHEN IT'S

02:56:43.092 --> 02:56:44.427
TO THEIR ADVANTAGE.

02:56:44.493 --> 02:56:46.162
BUT WHEN IS NOT TO THEIR

02:56:46.228 --> 02:56:46.829
ADVANTAGE THEY DO WHAT THEY WANT

02:56:46.896 --> 02:56:47.396
TO DO.

02:56:47.463 --> 02:56:48.664
AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN THE

02:56:48.731 --> 02:56:50.099
SITUATION AND IT NOT ONLY

02:56:50.166 --> 02:56:51.734
HAPPENED TO THESE FOLKS BUT IT

02:56:51.801 --> 02:56:54.003
HAPPENED AB ALMOST EVERYBODY IN

02:56:54.070 --> 02:56:54.870
SYSTEM.

02:56:54.937 --> 02:56:55.504
AND SO WHAT HAPPENED WAS THEY

02:56:55.571 --> 02:56:57.840
DECIDED TO ELIMINATE STEP

02:56:57.907 --> 02:56:59.075
INCREASES THE MERIT STEP

02:56:59.141 --> 02:57:00.609
INCREASES.

02:57:00.676 --> 02:57:02.044
NOT SINCE THEN THE OTHERS HAVE

02:57:02.111 --> 02:57:03.846
GONE BACK AND GOTTEN MERIT STEP

02:57:03.913 --> 02:57:05.648
INCREASES THE VARIOUS FORMS THEY

02:57:05.715 --> 02:57:07.249
HAVE REFUSED TO BARK TO GET TO

02:57:07.316 --> 02:57:09.151
GET THIS THIS PARTICULAR GROUP

02:57:09.218 --> 02:57:10.386
THE STEP INCREASES SO THEY'RE

02:57:10.453 --> 02:57:11.821
THE ONLY ONES NOW.

02:57:11.887 --> 02:57:14.023
WITHOUT THE 5% MERIT INCREASE

02:57:14.090 --> 02:57:15.725
POSSIBILITY THAT THAT DOESN'T

02:57:15.791 --> 02:57:17.193
MEAN YOU GET EVERY YEAR.

02:57:17.259 --> 02:57:18.294
AND IT'S NOT LIKE GETTING A

02:57:18.361 --> 02:57:20.129
RAISE WHEN YOU GET A RAISE AT

02:57:20.196 --> 02:57:21.697
THE SYSTEM WE GIVE THREE POINT

02:57:21.764 --> 02:57:23.199
FOUR TWO POINT WHATEVER RAISES.

02:57:23.265 --> 02:57:24.767
EVERYBODY GETS A RAISE OKAY WE

02:57:24.834 --> 02:57:25.868
UNDERSTAND THAT APPEAR BECAUSE

02:57:25.935 --> 02:57:27.269
THAT HAPPENS OCCASIONALLY WHERE

02:57:27.336 --> 02:57:28.404
EVERYBODY GETS A RAISE.

02:57:28.471 --> 02:57:29.472
BUT THEN WHEN YOU CAN DO

02:57:29.538 --> 02:57:31.307
ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATE YOUR

02:57:31.374 --> 02:57:34.410
FACULTY OR YOUR STAFF YOU CAN

02:57:34.477 --> 02:57:35.044
YOU CAN INCREASE THOSE WAYS THAT

02:57:35.111 --> 02:57:35.511
YOU CAN DO.

02:57:35.578 --> 02:57:36.579
THERE'S MERIT KINDS OF RACES

02:57:36.645 --> 02:57:38.247
THAT ARE THERE THIS IS A SYSTEM

02:57:38.314 --> 02:57:39.148
OF MAD WHEN I CAME INTO THIS

02:57:39.215 --> 02:57:41.283
ISSUE EVERYBODY HAD THE

02:57:41.350 --> 02:57:42.752
POSSIBILITY 5%.

02:57:42.818 --> 02:57:43.419
INCREASES.

02:57:43.486 --> 02:57:44.987
THEN THEY TOOK IT AWAY WITHOUT

02:57:45.054 --> 02:57:46.956
BARGAINING AND IT SHOULD HAVE

02:57:47.023 --> 02:57:48.391
BEEN BARGAIN BUT IT WAS NOT.

02:57:48.457 --> 02:57:49.692
SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS

02:57:49.759 --> 02:57:51.127
CORRECT SOMETHING THAT WAS DONE

02:57:51.193 --> 02:57:53.062
OUTSIDE OF THE BARGAINING THAT

02:57:53.129 --> 02:57:54.830
WAS REALLY UNFAIR AND UNJUST.

02:57:54.897 --> 02:57:55.931
AND EVERYBODY'S COAST TALK ABOUT

02:57:55.998 --> 02:57:57.933
BARGAINING WHEN THIS WAS TAKEN

02:57:58.000 --> 02:57:59.535
AWAY WITHOUT BARGAINING WHAT WAS

02:57:59.602 --> 02:58:01.203
SIMPLY TRYING TO DO IS PUT THIS

02:58:01.270 --> 02:58:02.738
PARTICULAR GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS

02:58:02.805 --> 02:58:05.408
BACK INTO THE SAME STRUCTURE AS

02:58:05.474 --> 02:58:07.043
EVERYONE ELSE AT THE UNIVERSITY.

02:58:07.109 --> 02:58:09.178
THAT ALLOWS THEM TO BASICALLY

02:58:09.245 --> 02:58:10.913
GET MERIT INCREASES THAT OF THE

02:58:10.980 --> 02:58:12.882
YEAR NOW THE INVERSION PIECE HAS

02:58:12.948 --> 02:58:14.517
OCCURRED BECAUSE OF ALL THE

02:58:14.583 --> 02:58:15.284
STUFF THAT HAPPENS AT THE

02:58:15.351 --> 02:58:16.118
UNIVERSITY.

02:58:16.185 --> 02:58:17.353
AND I CAN TESTIFY TO THE HOW

02:58:17.420 --> 02:58:19.755
HORRIBLE AND HOW DEMORALIZING

02:58:19.822 --> 02:58:21.457
INVERSION ME IS BECAUSE AS I

02:58:21.524 --> 02:58:22.324
WORK AT THE UNIVERSAL FORTY

02:58:22.391 --> 02:58:24.593
YEARS AFTER ABOUT TWENTY FIVE

02:58:24.660 --> 02:58:29.432
YEARS I HAD PEOPLE I WAS HIRING

02:58:29.498 --> 02:58:30.599
MAKING MORE MONEY THAN I WAS.

02:58:30.666 --> 02:58:31.467
AND IT TOOK A MAJOR ACT BY THE

02:58:31.534 --> 02:58:32.034
PRESIDENT OF THE CAMPUS TO

02:58:32.101 --> 02:58:33.235
INCREASE MY SALARY BECAUSE I HAD

02:58:33.302 --> 02:58:34.103
BEEN SUPERVISING PEOPLE MAKING

02:58:34.170 --> 02:58:35.237
MORE THAN I WAS BECAUSE OF THAT

02:58:35.304 --> 02:58:36.572
NEGOTIATIONS.

02:58:36.639 --> 02:58:37.807
AND ALL THE INVERSION STUFF THAT

02:58:37.873 --> 02:58:39.275
HAPPENED IT WAS STOLEN JUST.

02:58:39.341 --> 02:58:40.443
AND IS STILL A LOT OF THIS IN

02:58:40.509 --> 02:58:41.877
THE SYSTEM THAT NEEDS TO BE

02:58:41.944 --> 02:58:43.913
CLEANED OUT AND CLARIFIED AND

02:58:43.979 --> 02:58:44.447
IT'S ME.

02:58:44.513 --> 02:58:45.915
IN ITS EVEN MORE DEMORALIZING

02:58:45.981 --> 02:58:48.517
WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT -- YOU

02:58:48.584 --> 02:58:50.386
KNOW WE WE GIVE AS WHAT WAS

02:58:50.453 --> 02:58:52.288
HAPPENING MINISTERS ARE GETTING

02:58:52.354 --> 02:58:53.989
MAJOR INCREASES.

02:58:54.056 --> 02:58:55.891
SUPPOSEDLY MERIT INCREASES

02:58:55.958 --> 02:58:57.893
WITHOUT ANY PERFORMANCE.

02:58:57.960 --> 02:58:59.562
NOW AS A A CHAIR OF A DEPARTMENT

02:58:59.628 --> 02:59:03.566
I HAD TO EVALUATE MY FACULTY

02:59:03.632 --> 02:59:04.667
EVERY YEAR.

02:59:04.733 --> 02:59:05.234
I HAD TO GIVE THEM GOALS AND

02:59:05.301 --> 02:59:05.868
OBJECTIVES AND SO FORTH AND SO

02:59:05.935 --> 02:59:07.103
ON BUT I HAD NO ABILITY AT ALL

02:59:07.169 --> 02:59:08.637
AT THAT POINT. TO SAY AND AS A

02:59:08.704 --> 02:59:10.039
RESULT THIS PROB GOING TO

02:59:10.106 --> 02:59:11.373
RECOMMEND THIS PERSON FOR ME ARE

02:59:11.440 --> 02:59:12.608
THE CHESTNUT.

02:59:12.675 --> 02:59:15.077
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE IT.

02:59:15.144 --> 02:59:16.545
AS THEY HAD IN OTHER AREAS.

02:59:16.612 --> 02:59:18.547
AND SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS

02:59:18.614 --> 02:59:20.216
AN INJUSTICE THAT OCCURRED.

02:59:20.282 --> 02:59:21.851
WHEN THEY DECIDED THE

02:59:21.917 --> 02:59:23.619
ADMINISTRATION TOOK THE MERIT

02:59:23.686 --> 02:59:25.421
OUT OF THE MERIT STEPPED OUT OF

02:59:25.488 --> 02:59:27.022
OUT OF THE ABILITY OF THESE

02:59:27.089 --> 02:59:27.990
FOLKS WHO WORK THERE?

02:59:28.057 --> 02:59:28.924
AND THEY HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING

02:59:28.991 --> 02:59:30.159
EVER SINCE TO BRING BACK BUT IT

02:59:30.226 --> 02:59:32.061
WAS NOT TAKEN IN THE NORMAL

02:59:32.128 --> 02:59:34.563
PROCESS WHICH WOULD BEEN TO

02:59:34.630 --> 02:59:35.831
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING.

02:59:35.898 --> 02:59:36.866
MAY I DON'T WANT PEOPLE CAN

02:59:36.932 --> 02:59:38.234
UNDERSTAND THE STRUCTURE THAT

02:59:38.300 --> 02:59:39.668
HAS HAPPENED AND WHY THIS IS

02:59:39.735 --> 02:59:41.137
BEING BROUGHT HERE I WOULD NOT

02:59:41.203 --> 02:59:42.905
HAVE BROUGHT IT IF IT HAD BEEN

02:59:42.972 --> 02:59:45.174
NEGOTIATED NAY LOST THE GHOST

02:59:45.241 --> 02:59:46.208
ASIANS OF THIS DATA THAT.

02:59:46.275 --> 02:59:49.078
THEY TOOK IT WITHOUT

02:59:49.145 --> 02:59:51.780
NEGOTIATIONS.

02:59:51.847 --> 02:59:53.849
BEFORE I GO TO VOTE BOTH OF THE

02:59:53.916 --> 02:59:55.184
LIKE WHATEVER'S BUT I I HAVE

02:59:55.251 --> 02:59:56.252
MEMBERS WHO SURE -- I THINK

02:59:56.318 --> 02:59:58.287
STILL HAVE QUESTIONS SO WHAT ARE

02:59:58.354 --> 02:59:59.788
THE MEMBERS FIRST.

02:59:59.855 --> 03:00:03.459
MY QUESTION GOES TO THE YES.

03:00:03.526 --> 03:00:06.595
GO AHEAD MR ROOM ON THE UHHUH.

03:00:06.662 --> 03:00:07.730
FIRST I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE --

03:00:07.796 --> 03:00:09.832
ARE A A FRIEND FROM FRESNO IN

03:00:09.899 --> 03:00:11.967
THIS FLIGHT OF FANCY ABOUT WHAT

03:00:12.034 --> 03:00:15.004
MIGHT.

03:00:15.070 --> 03:00:17.406
WHEN YOU SEE LA SHOWS UP -- BUT

03:00:17.473 --> 03:00:19.208
BUT I WANT TO HEAR YOUR RESPONSE

03:00:19.275 --> 03:00:21.377
TO THE OF THE ISSUE THAT --

03:00:21.443 --> 03:00:23.879
DOCTOR WEBER I JUST REYES BUT I

03:00:23.946 --> 03:00:24.947
AM I HAVE TO SAY I'M A BIT

03:00:25.014 --> 03:00:27.449
CONFUSED NOW WHETHER.

03:00:27.516 --> 03:00:29.618
THE THE ISSUE IS THE MERIT

03:00:29.685 --> 03:00:32.354
INCREASE OR THE INVERSION OR

03:00:32.421 --> 03:00:33.822
WHETHER OR AND THAT'S THE INTER

03:00:33.889 --> 03:00:36.659
CONNECTED TO THE OF THE TWO BUT

03:00:36.725 --> 03:00:38.627
MAYBE ALL OF THIS IS WHY THIS IS

03:00:38.694 --> 03:00:40.696
A SUBJECT THAT'S FRANKLY I THINK

03:00:40.763 --> 03:00:41.530
BETTER.

03:00:41.597 --> 03:00:44.533
BETTER DEALT WITH OUTSIDE OF

03:00:44.600 --> 03:00:45.734
AREA.

03:00:45.801 --> 03:00:47.369
A HEARING LIKE THIS BUT WE'RE

03:00:47.436 --> 03:00:50.306
HERE I VOTED FOR THIS LAST TIME --

03:00:50.372 --> 03:00:52.107
I'M NOT SURE WHERE I WANT TO GO

03:00:52.174 --> 03:00:52.741
BUT I DO WANT TO HEAR FROM BOTH

03:00:52.808 --> 03:00:53.442
SIDES.

03:00:53.509 --> 03:00:54.977
ON WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED

03:00:55.044 --> 03:01:01.050
BECAUSE WE HEARD THAT CSU --

03:01:01.116 --> 03:01:02.985
ELIMINATED -- THIS BENEFIT

03:01:03.052 --> 03:01:04.353
OUTSIDE OF BARGAINING -- AND NOW

03:01:04.420 --> 03:01:05.421
EVERYBODY ELSE HAS IT.

03:01:05.487 --> 03:01:06.889
ON SO IF THAT'S ALL THE CASE

03:01:06.956 --> 03:01:08.190
THEN THE QUESTION IS IT SEEMS TO

03:01:08.257 --> 03:01:09.959
ME THAT THERE'S IF IFIT'S

03:01:10.025 --> 03:01:11.360
ACCURATE THERE'S AN AND JUSTICE

03:01:11.427 --> 03:01:13.062
THAT'S HAPPENING AND YOU'VE HAD

03:01:13.128 --> 03:01:16.165
A YEAR NOW. TO THINK ABOUT THIS

03:01:16.232 --> 03:01:18.033
ISSUE -- I THINK IT'S BEEN A

03:01:18.100 --> 03:01:20.402
YEAR SINCE WE HEARD IT LAST AND

03:01:20.469 --> 03:01:22.004
I WOULD JUST THINK YOU WOULD

03:01:22.071 --> 03:01:24.206
HAVE SPENT SOME TIME ON IT SO

03:01:24.273 --> 03:01:25.441
YOU COULD LIKE.

03:01:25.507 --> 03:01:28.711
A JOKE ADDRESS -- COLLECTIVELY

03:01:28.777 --> 03:01:30.546
ALL THOSE ISSUES ARE.

03:01:30.613 --> 03:01:31.680
I'D VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE

03:01:31.747 --> 03:01:33.549
OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO -- WITH THE

03:01:33.616 --> 03:01:34.383
GREATEST OF RESPECT -- THERE WAS

03:01:34.450 --> 03:01:36.352
NOTHING WHICH WAS JUST TOLD TO

03:01:36.418 --> 03:01:37.119
THIS COMMITTEE WHICH JACKIE'S

03:01:37.186 --> 03:01:38.754
AYE THE STOCK HISTORICALLY

03:01:38.821 --> 03:01:40.122
ACCURATE OR IS CURRENTLY

03:01:40.189 --> 03:01:42.157
REFLECTS THE SITUATION IN THE C.

03:01:42.224 --> 03:01:42.758
ISSUE.

03:01:42.825 --> 03:01:43.325
I'VE MAIN BARGAINING THESE

03:01:43.392 --> 03:01:45.728
CONTRACTS SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX

03:01:45.794 --> 03:01:46.795
I'VE BEEN THE CHIEF NEGOTIATOR

03:01:46.862 --> 03:01:49.698
OF MULTIPLE CYCLES OF BARGAINING.

03:01:49.765 --> 03:01:52.835
HISTORICALLY WHAT HAPPENED WAS

03:01:52.901 --> 03:01:54.370
THAT.

03:01:54.436 --> 03:01:55.004
IN THE MID NINETEEN NINETY IS.

03:01:55.070 --> 03:01:56.005
THE STATE DECIDED TO CHANGE THE

03:01:56.071 --> 03:01:58.040
WAY THAT FUNDS WERE APPROPRIATED

03:01:58.107 --> 03:01:59.141
TO THE CSU.

03:01:59.208 --> 03:02:02.177
PREVIOUSLY THE STATE PROVIDED

03:02:02.244 --> 03:02:03.345
MONEY.

03:02:03.412 --> 03:02:04.980
FOR ARTS STEPPING INCREASES AND

03:02:05.047 --> 03:02:06.415
THAT WAS PART OF THE C. ISSUES

03:02:06.482 --> 03:02:07.683
BUDGET.

03:02:07.750 --> 03:02:09.018
THE STATE MOVED AWAY AND GAVE US

03:02:09.084 --> 03:02:11.086
A BLOCK AMOUNTS OF MONEY AND

03:02:11.153 --> 03:02:13.055
SAID YOU CSU NOW DECIDE HOW YOU

03:02:13.122 --> 03:02:14.623
SPEND THAT MONEY.

03:02:14.690 --> 03:02:17.159
SO WE NEGOTIATED WITH ALL UNIONS

03:02:17.226 --> 03:02:19.228
TO MOVE AWAY FROM.

03:02:19.295 --> 03:02:20.529
WHAT GENERALLY COULD BE COLD

03:02:20.596 --> 03:02:21.930
STEP SYSTEM EVEN THOUGH IT WILL

03:02:21.997 --> 03:02:23.299
HE DIDN'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE

03:02:23.365 --> 03:02:24.500
STATE CIVIL SERVICE?

03:02:24.566 --> 03:02:27.569
TOWARDS A SYSTEM OF OPEN RANGES.

03:02:27.636 --> 03:02:28.537
NOW.

03:02:28.604 --> 03:02:31.440
THERE WAS ONE UNION CSU A YOU.

03:02:31.507 --> 03:02:33.909
WHO DIDN'T NEGOTIATE?

03:02:33.976 --> 03:02:36.278
OPEN RANGES AND WE WENT THROUGH

03:02:36.345 --> 03:02:37.680
THE STATURE TREAT IMPASSE

03:02:37.746 --> 03:02:40.249
PROCEDURE UNDER HERE.

03:02:40.316 --> 03:02:41.483
AND UNDER HERE AT THE

03:02:41.550 --> 03:02:43.619
ADMINISTRATION HAS THE ABILITY

03:02:43.686 --> 03:02:46.288
TO IMPOSE ITS LAST OFFER.

03:02:46.355 --> 03:02:46.822
FOR THE LAST OFFER WITHIN

03:02:46.889 --> 03:02:48.090
REASONABLE CONTEMPLATION OF THE

03:02:48.157 --> 03:02:49.925
PARTS SO TO SAY THAT IT WAS DONE

03:02:49.992 --> 03:02:52.361
OUTSIDE OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

03:02:52.428 --> 03:02:55.331
IS TO COMPLETELY IGNORE HERO.

03:02:55.397 --> 03:02:57.566
AND THE TERMS WHICH UNDER WHICH

03:02:57.633 --> 03:02:58.067
WE OPERATE AS COLLECTIVE

03:02:58.133 --> 03:02:58.967
BARGAINING.

03:02:59.034 --> 03:03:00.436
SO SINCE THE AND ONE OF THE

03:03:00.502 --> 03:03:01.503
REASONS WHY THE HASN'T BEEN

03:03:01.570 --> 03:03:03.238
RANGE MOVEMENT WHICH IS WHAT

03:03:03.305 --> 03:03:04.540
THIS REALLY AMOUNTS.

03:03:04.606 --> 03:03:06.208
TO IS THE EVERY TIME WE HAVE

03:03:06.275 --> 03:03:06.942
GIVEN.

03:03:07.009 --> 03:03:09.611
SALARY INCREASES BY WAY OF

03:03:09.678 --> 03:03:11.580
GENERAL SALARY INCREASES.

03:03:11.647 --> 03:03:13.282
THE UNIONS HAVE PASSED.

03:03:13.349 --> 03:03:14.750
AND DEMANDED THAT THE MINIMUM

03:03:14.817 --> 03:03:16.118
AND A MAXIMUM OF THE RANGE IS

03:03:16.185 --> 03:03:18.320
INCREASED BY THE SAME PERCENTAGE

03:03:18.387 --> 03:03:19.421
OF THE G. SI.

03:03:19.488 --> 03:03:21.023
SO WE CAN PUT HUNDREDS OF

03:03:21.090 --> 03:03:22.391
MILLIONS OF WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF

03:03:22.458 --> 03:03:24.760
MILLIONS IN TWENTY PLAY SALARIES.

03:03:24.827 --> 03:03:25.994
AND THE POSITIONING RANGE HASN'T

03:03:26.061 --> 03:03:27.963
NECESSARILY CHANGED BECAUSE THE

03:03:28.030 --> 03:03:29.164
MINIMUM AND A MAXIMUM THROUGH

03:03:29.231 --> 03:03:30.899
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING TO BE

03:03:30.966 --> 03:03:32.901
INCREASED BY THE SAME PERCENTAGE.

03:03:32.968 --> 03:03:34.503
HE WAS A A SEPARATE MECHANISM

03:03:34.570 --> 03:03:36.438
CALLED IN RANGE PROGRESSION TO

03:03:36.505 --> 03:03:38.407
DO INDIVIDUAL INCREASES.

03:03:38.474 --> 03:03:40.476
AND THAT'S SOMETHING WHICH THE

03:03:40.542 --> 03:03:41.910
CAMPUS IS DIRECTLY FUND.

03:03:41.977 --> 03:03:43.245
SO THE SECOND PART OF THIS IS

03:03:43.312 --> 03:03:45.314
EVERYBODY ELSE GETS MERIT SALARY

03:03:45.381 --> 03:03:46.582
INCREASES THAT'S NOT A TIME

03:03:46.648 --> 03:03:49.184
WHICH WE USE INCIDENT IN THE CSU.

03:03:49.251 --> 03:03:50.386
AS FAR AS YOU THE STAFF UNITS

03:03:50.452 --> 03:03:56.892
ARE CONCERNED THEY ALSO USE THE

03:03:56.959 --> 03:03:58.894
IN RANGE PROGRESSION MECHANISM

03:03:58.961 --> 03:03:59.862
IN ORDER TO DO EQUITY

03:03:59.928 --> 03:04:01.196
ADJUSTMENTS DEAL WITH LONGEVITY.

03:04:01.263 --> 03:04:03.332
AND DEAL WITH -- ISSUES AROUND

03:04:03.399 --> 03:04:04.700
INVASION AND COMPRESSION -- THE

03:04:04.767 --> 03:04:06.101
ONLY.

03:04:06.168 --> 03:04:06.735
SALARY INCREASE WHICH IS LINKED

03:04:06.802 --> 03:04:08.337
TO ME AND MERITS IS ACTUALLY FOR

03:04:08.404 --> 03:04:09.571
THE M. P. P.'S WHERE THERE IS A

03:04:09.638 --> 03:04:10.906
REQUIREMENT OF SATISFACTORY

03:04:10.973 --> 03:04:12.441
SERVICE TO GET ANY TYPE OF

03:04:12.508 --> 03:04:13.542
INCREASE A TOLL.

03:04:13.609 --> 03:04:15.978
IN A YEAR BUT FOR THE OTHER

03:04:16.044 --> 03:04:18.180
BARGAINING UNITS -- SALARIES ARE

03:04:18.247 --> 03:04:19.815
GIVEN SO SALARY INCREASES ARE

03:04:19.882 --> 03:04:21.483
GIVEN TO EVERYBODY WHO'S IN PAY

03:04:21.550 --> 03:04:22.751
STATUS AT THE DATE THAT THE

03:04:22.818 --> 03:04:24.153
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT

03:04:24.219 --> 03:04:26.789
IS RATIFIED WAR RETROACTIVELY

03:04:26.855 --> 03:04:28.157
FAST NEGOTIATED AT THE TABLE.

03:04:28.223 --> 03:04:29.625
SO ALL OF THIS IS SUBJECT TO

03:04:29.691 --> 03:04:32.861
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ALL OF

03:04:32.928 --> 03:04:34.129
THIS IS BEING DEALT WITH.

03:04:34.196 --> 03:04:35.764
MANY MANY TIMES OVER MULTIPLE

03:04:35.831 --> 03:04:37.099
DAYS OVER MULTIPLE YEARS.

03:04:37.166 --> 03:04:39.034
I'M NOT STILL REMAINS THE BEST

03:04:39.101 --> 03:04:41.003
AND ONLY MECHANISM TO MAKE ANY

03:04:41.069 --> 03:04:42.337
MEANINGFUL PROGRESS.

03:04:42.404 --> 03:04:44.339
IN RELATION TO THESE SERIOUS

03:04:44.406 --> 03:04:47.042
ISSUES WHICH WE ARE BOTH TRIED

03:04:47.109 --> 03:04:50.279
TO FACE -- UNION AND MANAGEMENT

03:04:50.345 --> 03:04:53.615
TO LIGHT.

03:04:53.682 --> 03:04:54.483
THE OTHER ISSUE IS OF SOME

03:04:54.550 --> 03:04:56.852
UNIONS HAVE NEGOTIATED A THERE'S

03:04:56.919 --> 03:04:59.054
A USUALLY A POOL OF MONEY THAT

03:04:59.121 --> 03:05:00.689
WE PUT INTO COMPENSATION.

03:05:00.756 --> 03:05:02.224
AND THE UNION.

03:05:02.291 --> 03:05:03.826
OF SOME UNIONS HAVE CHOSEN TO

03:05:03.892 --> 03:05:05.961
SPLIT THAT UP SO THAT LOWER PAID

03:05:06.028 --> 03:05:08.197
EMPLOYEES LECTURERS ARE A FACTOR

03:05:08.263 --> 03:05:10.332
OF FACULTY.

03:05:10.399 --> 03:05:11.767
CAN'T GET COMPETITION.

03:05:11.834 --> 03:05:12.568
THIS IS QUESTION ABOUT

03:05:12.634 --> 03:05:14.002
DISTRIBUTION WE KNOW TO GET WE

03:05:14.069 --> 03:05:15.904
WE BARGAINED ESSENTIALLY THE

03:05:15.971 --> 03:05:17.339
SIZE OF THE POOL IN DOLLAR TERMS

03:05:17.406 --> 03:05:18.707
OR IN PERCENTAGE TERMS.

03:05:18.774 --> 03:05:20.209
AND THEN HOW IT'S DISTRIBUTED

03:05:20.275 --> 03:05:22.444
AMONGST THE THE DIFFERENT

03:05:22.511 --> 03:05:24.146
EMPLOYEE GROUPS.

03:05:24.213 --> 03:05:25.547
SOME OF OUR UNIONS PARTICULARLY

03:05:25.614 --> 03:05:28.717
THE CFA THE FACULTY HAVE BEING.

03:05:28.784 --> 03:05:30.085
HAVE WILLING TO WORK WITH THOSE

03:05:30.152 --> 03:05:31.787
AND COME UP WITH DIFFERENTIAL

03:05:31.854 --> 03:05:33.489
DISTRIBUTION MECHANISMS.

03:05:33.555 --> 03:05:35.557
AS FAR AS I STAFF UNITS IN

03:05:35.624 --> 03:05:37.025
PARTICULAR THE CSU YOU.

03:05:37.092 --> 03:05:38.694
EVEN THOUGH WE'VE PRESENTED THEM

03:05:38.760 --> 03:05:40.362
WITH PROPOSALS WHICH WOULD

03:05:40.429 --> 03:05:41.563
ADDRESS EQUITY ISSUES WHICH

03:05:41.630 --> 03:05:42.698
WOULD AGGRESSIVE RECRUITMENT AND

03:05:42.764 --> 03:05:44.333
RETENTION ON EACH AND EVERY

03:05:44.399 --> 03:05:46.168
OCCASION THE UNION HAS DEMANDED

03:05:46.235 --> 03:05:48.537
THAT THE MONEY BE DISTRIBUTED BY

03:05:48.604 --> 03:05:49.905
WAY OF GENERAL SALARY INCREASE.

03:05:49.972 --> 03:05:51.874
SO WE DO BARGAIN THESE THINGS

03:05:51.940 --> 03:05:53.208
BUT ULTIMATELY IT'S BEEN THE

03:05:53.275 --> 03:05:54.843
UNION THAT DEMANDED THE

03:05:54.910 --> 03:05:56.178
EVERYBODY GETS THE SAME

03:05:56.245 --> 03:05:57.546
PERCENTAGE BECAUSE THAT'S

03:05:57.613 --> 03:05:59.081
POLITICALLY.

03:05:59.147 --> 03:06:01.149
WHAT THEY CAN GET RATIFIED SO TO

03:06:01.216 --> 03:06:02.818
HEAR THAT THE CSU IS NOT BEEN

03:06:02.885 --> 03:06:07.055
SEEKING TO DO THIS IS AN

03:06:07.122 --> 03:06:08.957
ABSOLUTE -- FAILURE TO RECOGNIZE

03:06:09.024 --> 03:06:09.491
WHAT WE HAVE DONE ON THE

03:06:09.558 --> 03:06:11.393
PROPOSALS WHICH WE HAVE MADE IN

03:06:11.460 --> 03:06:12.728
WHICH WE CONTINUE TO MAKE.

03:06:12.794 --> 03:06:14.263
BOTH OUTSIDE OF BARGAINING WHICH

03:06:14.329 --> 03:06:15.998
WILL MAKE IN THE NEXT BARGAINING

03:06:16.064 --> 03:06:16.865
CYCLE.

03:06:16.932 --> 03:06:18.867
I MAY I THINK HE DID HIGHLIGHTED

03:06:18.934 --> 03:06:20.903
A POINT WHICH IS HERE UP HERE A

03:06:20.969 --> 03:06:22.237
IS GEARED TOWARDS THE EMPLOYER

03:06:22.304 --> 03:06:23.839
IT PUTS US US THE EMPLOYEES AT A

03:06:23.906 --> 03:06:25.374
DISADVANTAGE BECAUSE WE ARE

03:06:25.440 --> 03:06:27.009
REQUIRED TO TAKE.

03:06:27.075 --> 03:06:28.977
THE LAST BEST AND FINAL AND IN

03:06:29.044 --> 03:06:30.145
THIS CASE IT UNILATERALLY WE SAY

03:06:30.212 --> 03:06:31.813
IT UNILATERALLY BECAUSE WE DID

03:06:31.880 --> 03:06:33.382
NOT AGREE TO IT WAS A LAST BEST

03:06:33.448 --> 03:06:34.583
AND FINAL WHEN WE WERE STUCK

03:06:34.650 --> 03:06:36.184
WITH THE STEPS REMOVED.

03:06:36.251 --> 03:06:37.853
FROM OUR MEMBERS NOW SINCE THEN

03:06:37.920 --> 03:06:39.354
THEY'VE NEGOTIATED VARIOUS OTHER

03:06:39.421 --> 03:06:40.856
FORMS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN

03:06:40.923 --> 03:06:42.157
SUCCESSFUL IN ARE NOT TO THE

03:06:42.224 --> 03:06:43.859
SAME CALIBER AND THAT'S

03:06:43.926 --> 03:06:45.227
PROBLEMATIC IN PART WHEN THE

03:06:45.294 --> 03:06:46.328
SALARY STEPS ARE.

03:06:46.395 --> 03:06:48.030
INCREASING REFLECTING COLA BUT

03:06:48.096 --> 03:06:49.898
WE HAVE A MEMBER THAT'S WORK FOR

03:06:49.965 --> 03:06:50.465
FIFTY THREE YEARS IS ONLY

03:06:50.532 --> 03:06:52.167
HALFWAY THROUGH THE SALARY RANGE

03:06:52.234 --> 03:06:53.735
I DON'T KNOW IF WORKING MORE

03:06:53.802 --> 03:06:54.903
THAN HALF A CENTURY.

03:06:54.970 --> 03:06:56.338
SHOULDN'T YOU TOWARDS THE MAX

03:06:56.405 --> 03:06:57.472
RANGE BUT I THINK THAT'S HIGHLY

03:06:57.539 --> 03:06:58.907
PROBLEMATIC TO REFLECT ON

03:06:58.974 --> 03:07:01.843
ACTUALLY SIX SIX OF OUR SIXTEEN

03:07:01.910 --> 03:07:03.045
THOUSAND MEMBERS ARE IN THE HIGH

03:07:03.111 --> 03:07:04.079
END OF THE RANGE.

03:07:04.146 --> 03:07:05.380
THERE'S NO CONVERSATION THAT

03:07:05.447 --> 03:07:06.648
HAPPENS AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE

03:07:06.715 --> 03:07:08.917
I ACTUALLY HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF

03:07:08.984 --> 03:07:09.985
MEETING YOU WHEN I WAS AN INTERN

03:07:10.052 --> 03:07:11.520
DURING NEGOTIATED AND HE IS VERY

03:07:11.587 --> 03:07:12.688
TOUGH.

03:07:12.754 --> 03:07:13.622
BUT HE WAS NOT NEGOTIATED ON

03:07:13.689 --> 03:07:15.757
THIS SO I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT

03:07:15.824 --> 03:07:17.059
THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE

03:07:17.125 --> 03:07:17.993
UP WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT

03:07:18.060 --> 03:07:18.660
TRADITIONAL COLLECTIVE

03:07:18.727 --> 03:07:20.095
BARGAINING IT IS A LITTLE BIT OF

03:07:20.162 --> 03:07:22.264
A BIASED -- ARGUMENT THAT WE

03:07:22.331 --> 03:07:23.231
HAVE TO TALK ABOUT CLICK THE

03:07:23.298 --> 03:07:28.870
BARGAINING WERE UNDER A

03:07:28.937 --> 03:07:31.573
DIFFERENT SYSTEM.

03:07:31.640 --> 03:07:33.008
I JUST WANT BY FINAL PARTS OF

03:07:33.075 --> 03:07:35.377
STEP TO THE CHAIR NOT MAKE

03:07:35.444 --> 03:07:38.680
MISTER CHAIR OF TWENTY SECOND.

03:07:38.747 --> 03:07:39.281
I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO LOOK

03:07:39.348 --> 03:07:40.515
TOWARDS THE MEMBERS OF THE

03:07:40.582 --> 03:07:41.883
MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS YEAH I I

03:07:41.950 --> 03:07:42.918
DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS IN THE

03:07:42.985 --> 03:07:44.453
COMMENT BUT IF I GO THIS IS

03:07:44.519 --> 03:07:44.920
HELPFUL FOR ME OKAY.

03:07:44.987 --> 03:07:46.888
QUESTION YEAH BUT IF YOU IF YOU

03:07:46.955 --> 03:07:48.690
WANNA RESPOND GO AHEAD CERTAINLY

03:07:48.757 --> 03:07:49.524
AND AND THIS THIS GOES. TO

03:07:49.591 --> 03:07:50.959
REMEMBER THIS -- POINTS ABOUT

03:07:51.026 --> 03:07:51.860
THE THE TYPES OF EMPLOYEES HERE

03:07:51.927 --> 03:07:53.395
IF YOU EXCLUDE MP PAYS THE

03:07:53.462 --> 03:07:54.062
MANAGERS AND THE FACULTY.

03:07:54.129 --> 03:07:54.596
I WAS JUST CHECKING WE'RE

03:07:54.663 --> 03:07:56.365
LOOKING AT A RANGE OF EMPLOYEES

03:07:56.431 --> 03:07:58.066
WHO AT A MINIMUM -- THE MINIMUM

03:07:58.133 --> 03:08:00.268
THE SALARY RANGE WILL BE TWO

03:08:00.335 --> 03:08:00.902
THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS PER

03:08:00.969 --> 03:08:01.536
MONTH.

03:08:01.603 --> 03:08:02.604
AND THEN THE MAXIMUM OF THE

03:08:02.671 --> 03:08:05.073
HIGHEST RANGE WILL BE TWENTY ONE

03:08:05.140 --> 03:08:05.674
THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS

03:08:05.741 --> 03:08:05.974
PER MONTH.

03:08:06.041 --> 03:08:07.009
SO WE'RE NOT JUST LOOKING AT

03:08:07.075 --> 03:08:08.977
PEOPLE AT THE BOTTOM AND WE HAVE

03:08:09.044 --> 03:08:11.046

BARKING UNITS HAVE BEEN PAID

03:08:13.882 --> 03:08:15.183
VERY GOOD SIX FIGURE SALARIES.

03:08:15.250 --> 03:08:16.885
AND THIS BILL WOULD GIVE THEM

03:08:16.952 --> 03:08:18.754
50% INCREASE FOR TEN YEARS JUST

03:08:18.820 --> 03:08:20.722
THE SAME AS THE GROUNDS KEEPERS

IN THE CUSTODIANS IN THE FOOD

03:08:21.857 --> 03:08:23.058
SERVICE WORKERS.

IT'S A BLUNT INSTRUMENT IT

03:08:25.293 --> 03:08:32.300
DOESN'T DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM IT

03:08:32.367 --> 03:08:35.771
JUST MAKES IT WORSE.

03:08:35.837 --> 03:08:36.972

I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND MY

03:09:14.076 --> 03:09:15.010
THINKING ABOUT THE MANDATE THAT

03:09:15.077 --> 03:09:17.179
CSU MUCH USE EXISTING RESOURCES

03:09:17.245 --> 03:09:20.982
TO PAY FOR THE ON GOING 5% OF

03:09:21.049 --> 03:09:24.152
WHAT THE THINKING IS BEHIND THAT.

03:09:24.219 --> 03:09:26.321
SURE SO -- MR GABRIEL GREAT

03:09:26.388 --> 03:09:28.790
QUESTION -- WE SOLVE THIS FUND

03:09:28.857 --> 03:09:31.226
OF MONEY -- AS MUCH AS A MISSED

03:09:31.293 --> 03:09:33.528
MARTINEZ WANTS TO CLAIM THAT IT

03:09:33.595 --> 03:09:36.031
IS EARMARKED MONEY -- AND

03:09:36.098 --> 03:09:37.599
ACTUALLY THAT HAS TRANSITIONED

03:09:37.666 --> 03:09:39.301
OVER TIME TO LAST YEAR IT

03:09:39.367 --> 03:09:40.902

MAY ABOUT THE PARKING PROGRAM

03:09:50.045 --> 03:09:51.513
BUT THAT'S THE INTENT.

03:09:51.580 --> 03:09:52.948
IF YOU LOOK AT THE DOCUMENT

03:09:53.014 --> 03:09:54.750

APPELLATE COURT RULED FOUR YEARS

03:11:08.557 --> 03:11:10.525

IMPOSED AND TOOK OUT STEPS.

03:11:31.446 --> 03:11:32.681
SO WHEN THE COURT.

03:11:34.115 --> 03:11:35.817
DECEMBER OF NINETEEN NINETY SIX

03:11:35.884 --> 03:11:37.152
WE COULDN'T APPLY IT TO THE

03:11:37.219 --> 03:11:38.386
ACTION.

03:11:38.453 --> 03:11:39.821
OF REMOVING STEP BECAUSE IT ONLY

03:11:39.888 --> 03:11:42.791
APPLIED TO THE PRIOR ACTION OF

03:11:42.858 --> 03:11:44.359
NOT PAYING FOR STEPS.

03:11:44.426 --> 03:11:46.094
AND COMPENSATING OUR EMPLOYEES

03:11:46.161 --> 03:11:47.596
THROUGH.

03:11:47.662 --> 03:11:49.197
NINETEEN NINETY SIX SO THEY'VE

03:11:49.264 --> 03:11:50.799
BEEN PLAYING GAMES WITH THIS.

03:11:50.866 --> 03:11:53.568
WITH THESE EMPLOYEES -- I DON'T

03:11:53.635 --> 03:11:55.904
KNOW ANY STATE AGENCY THAT HAS A

03:11:55.971 --> 03:11:57.706
MULTI BILLION DOLLAR FUND.

03:11:57.772 --> 03:11:59.007
AGAIN THEY START OUT BY SAYING

03:11:59.074 --> 03:12:00.508
IF YOU'RE MARKED LESS THAN HALF

03:12:00.575 --> 03:12:01.977
OF THAT MONEY THEN THEY SAID IT

03:12:02.043 --> 03:12:04.579
WAS ONE TIME MONEY MR GABRIEL.

03:12:04.646 --> 03:12:06.147
SO WE WENT TO THE BOARD OF

03:12:06.214 --> 03:12:08.049
TRUSTEES WITH THIS DOCUMENT.

03:12:08.116 --> 03:12:09.251

WHITE ON FILM IS SHAKING HIS

03:12:13.989 --> 03:12:16.925
HEAD LIKE THIS.

03:12:16.992 --> 03:12:18.260

03:12:18.894 --> 03:12:22.163
FUND HE'S.

03:12:22.230 --> 03:12:23.198
SO THEY COME BACK AND TELL ME I

03:12:23.265 --> 03:12:24.266

SO WE DID. FOUR DAYS LATER MR

03:12:31.273 --> 03:12:32.974
GABRIEL FOUR DAYS LATER.

03:12:33.041 --> 03:12:34.309
CHANCE FOR WHITE COMES OUT IN

03:12:34.376 --> 03:12:36.177
THE PRESENCE AS WE ARE NOT GOING

03:12:36.244 --> 03:12:38.580
TO PURSUE A STUDENT TUITION

03:12:38.647 --> 03:12:39.748
INCREASE THIS YEAR.

03:12:39.814 --> 03:12:42.117
WHY BECAUSE WE HAVE A MULTI

03:12:42.183 --> 03:12:45.954
BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS?

03:12:46.021 --> 03:12:47.122
HE'S NOT GOING TO SEE THAT

03:12:47.188 --> 03:12:47.722
THAT'S ONE TIME ON YOUR YOUR

03:12:47.789 --> 03:12:49.891
MARK MONEY THAT IS MONEY AS

03:12:49.958 --> 03:12:51.493
DISCRETIONARY ONGOING FIND AT

OF THE DISCRETIONARY MONEY.

03:13:01.636 --> 03:13:02.871

03:13:47.716 --> 03:13:48.516
COUNTIES CLEARANCE TRANSPARENT

03:13:48.583 --> 03:13:49.784
AS WELL AS THE THIS THE REASONS

03:13:49.851 --> 03:13:50.618
WHY IT'S KEPT IN THE SOURCES OF

03:13:50.685 --> 03:13:51.720
MONEY FROM WHERE IT COMES IN THE

03:13:51.786 --> 03:13:53.555
REASONS WHY WE NEED THOSE MONIES

03:13:53.621 --> 03:13:56.725
IN VISITS.

03:13:56.791 --> 03:13:58.126
THANK YOU FOR THAT NIGHT JUST

03:13:58.193 --> 03:13:58.960
ONE OTHER QUESTION FOR THE

03:13:59.027 --> 03:14:00.662
AUTHOR WHICH IS -- JUST AT THE

03:14:00.729 --> 03:14:02.230
ABOUT THE 5% NUMBER HOW YOU

03:14:02.297 --> 03:14:03.465
ARRIVED AT THAT.

03:14:03.531 --> 03:14:04.466
THAT'S BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE

03:14:04.532 --> 03:14:06.234
NORMAL STEP WAS I MEAN THERE WAS

03:14:06.301 --> 03:14:08.903
A 5% STEP INCREASE BETWEEN THE

03:14:08.970 --> 03:14:10.705
VARIOUS LEVELS OF EMPLOYMENT IF

03:14:10.772 --> 03:14:11.873
YOU CAME IN A CERTAIN LEVEL THE

03:14:11.940 --> 03:14:13.742
NEXT STEP WAS 5% 5% DEPENDING

03:14:13.808 --> 03:14:15.443
UPON YOUR EVALUATIONS NOT DONE

03:14:15.510 --> 03:14:16.344
EVERY YEAR.

03:14:16.411 --> 03:14:17.312
AND DEPENDING UPON WHAT THE

03:14:17.379 --> 03:14:19.547
MONIES AVAILABLE AND ALSO WITH

03:14:19.614 --> 03:14:21.116
THE NOT TO GET A RECOMMENDATION.

03:14:21.182 --> 03:14:22.751
SO IT'S NOT AN AUTOMATIC THING

03:14:22.817 --> 03:14:24.085
THAT HAPPENS IS ONE OF THE FEW

03:14:24.152 --> 03:14:25.987
THINGS THAT REALLY IS AMERICA

03:14:26.054 --> 03:14:26.821
JUST WENT WITH IT HAS TO BE

03:14:26.888 --> 03:14:28.723

03:14:28.790 --> 03:14:29.591
INDIVIDUAL.

03:14:29.657 --> 03:14:33.528
BUT THAT WAS STANDARD AT THE

03:14:33.595 --> 03:14:36.197

IT.

03:15:08.396 --> 03:15:10.331
OKAY BUT FROM THIS POINT ON WE

03:15:10.398 --> 03:15:11.332
WANT TO BE MADE WHOLE.

03:15:11.399 --> 03:15:12.534
GET US TO WHERE WE WERE AND THEY

03:15:12.600 --> 03:15:13.768
WERE HAPPY TO SIT DOWN AND DO

03:15:13.835 --> 03:15:15.804
NEGOTIATIONS COLLECTIVE BARGAIN

03:15:15.870 --> 03:15:17.038
THE WAY IT WAS INTENDED TO BE.

03:15:17.105 --> 03:15:18.039
THIS WAS NOT DONE THROUGH

03:15:18.106 --> 03:15:19.340
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IT WAS

03:15:19.407 --> 03:15:20.642
SUBVERTED.

03:15:20.708 --> 03:15:22.110
AND WE WERE IN THIS POSITION

03:15:22.177 --> 03:15:23.244
THAT WE WOULD NOT BE COMING TO

03:15:23.311 --> 03:15:24.279
YOU IF THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT

03:15:24.345 --> 03:15:26.181
WE HAD NEGOTIATED OR JUST MADE A

03:15:26.247 --> 03:15:27.749
BAD DECISION.

03:15:27.816 --> 03:15:30.518
MR SANTIAGO START TONIGHT I

03:15:30.585 --> 03:15:32.153
MISSED MR CHECK I MAKE A FEW

THANK YOU FOR THAT I I AM A THAT

03:15:37.492 --> 03:15:38.093
THE REASON I'M STRUGGLING THIS

03:15:38.159 --> 03:15:38.693
IS I'M.

03:15:38.760 --> 03:15:40.161
HAVE A A PRINCIPLE OUT THERE

03:15:40.228 --> 03:15:41.896
THAT I THINK -- YOU THINK THE

03:15:41.963 --> 03:15:43.064
THE THE AUTHORS ACKNOWLEDGED

03:15:43.131 --> 03:15:44.065
WHICH IS THAT I THINK IT'S

03:15:44.132 --> 03:15:45.166
IMPORTANT THINGS THAT OUGHT TO

03:15:45.233 --> 03:15:45.834
BE PART OF THE COLLECTIVE

03:15:45.900 --> 03:15:47.268
BARGAINING PROCESS ARE PART OF

03:15:47.335 --> 03:15:47.802
THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

03:15:47.869 --> 03:15:48.937
PROCESS I THINK IT'S REALLY

03:15:49.003 --> 03:15:50.238
REALLY IMPORTANT WE DON'T CREATE

03:15:50.305 --> 03:15:51.439
A PRECEDENT.

03:15:51.506 --> 03:15:52.474
THAT WOULD FOLKS DON'T GET WHAT

03:15:52.540 --> 03:15:53.641
THEY WANT IN THE PROCESS EITHER

03:15:53.708 --> 03:15:54.876
ON EITHER SIDE THAT THEY COME TO

03:15:54.943 --> 03:15:55.977
LEGISLATURE BECAUSE WE ARE NOT

03:15:56.044 --> 03:15:57.078
SUITED TO REFEREE THOSE

03:15:57.145 --> 03:15:57.979
DISCUSSIONS.

03:15:58.046 --> 03:15:59.180
THOSE ARE BEST LEFT TO THE

03:15:59.247 --> 03:16:00.482
BARGAINING UNITS TO THE

03:16:00.548 --> 03:16:01.616
UNIVERSITY TO HAVE THOSE

03:16:01.683 --> 03:16:03.084
CONVERSATIONS AND I I'M GLAD TO

03:16:03.151 --> 03:16:04.085
HEAR YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT DOCTOR

03:16:04.152 --> 03:16:04.919
EVER I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING

03:16:04.986 --> 03:16:05.553
THAT.

03:16:05.620 --> 03:16:06.187
HAVE YOU THAT I SURE I THINK I

03:16:06.254 --> 03:16:07.489
HEARD MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA

03:16:07.555 --> 03:16:08.723
MONICA SAY THAT AS WELL SO I

03:16:08.790 --> 03:16:10.358
THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT.

03:16:10.425 --> 03:16:11.126
THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT IS IT

03:16:11.192 --> 03:16:12.760
SEEMS TO ME FROM WHAT I CAN

03:16:12.827 --> 03:16:13.394
GATHER HERE THERE DOESN'T EVEN

03:16:13.461 --> 03:16:13.928
SEEM TO BE.

03:16:13.995 --> 03:16:15.296
A BASIC AGREEMENT ON THE FACTS

03:16:15.363 --> 03:16:16.798
BUT FROM WHAT I GATHER THERE'S A

03:16:16.865 --> 03:16:18.266
REAL AND SIGNIFICANT INJUSTICE

03:16:18.333 --> 03:16:19.968
YEAR IT SEEMS TOUGH PERSISTED

03:16:20.034 --> 03:16:20.802

03:17:37.345 --> 03:17:37.912
BIPARTISAN ISSUE THAT FOLKS ARE

THERE'S A REFUSAL TO NEGOTIATE

03:17:44.719 --> 03:17:45.620
WE END UP IN THESE.

03:17:45.687 --> 03:17:47.155
THESE TYPE OF SITUATIONS SO

03:17:47.222 --> 03:17:48.856

THOSE BILLS WERE THAT YOU WISH A

03:17:57.298 --> 03:17:58.132
ONE AWAY BECAUSE THERE'S NO NEED

03:17:58.199 --> 03:17:59.567
FOR IT BECAUSE IT WAS ALL TAKEN

03:17:59.634 --> 03:18:01.236
CARE OF THE CONTRACT.

03:18:01.302 --> 03:18:03.638
NEGOTIATION TABLES AND I WAS

OF FEEL CONFLICTED COMPLETED IN

03:18:09.110 --> 03:18:10.311
THE SENSE THAT.

03:18:10.378 --> 03:18:11.713
DOING CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS HERE

03:18:11.779 --> 03:18:13.381
IT IS IS A BIT OF A CHALLENGE

03:18:13.448 --> 03:18:15.250
HOWEVER HOWEVER WHEN CONTRACT

03:18:15.316 --> 03:18:16.884
NEGOTIATIONS BREAKS DOWN THIS IS

03:18:16.951 --> 03:18:18.453
THE POINT WHERE WE TRY TO

03:18:18.519 --> 03:18:19.520
ENCOURAGE AND PUSH IT.

03:18:19.587 --> 03:18:21.256
THE END WE HOPE THAT SOMETHING

03:18:21.322 --> 03:18:22.991
FAIR WOULD COME I DON'T THINK

03:18:23.057 --> 03:18:23.558
IT'S A IT'S A GOOD PRESENCE

03:18:23.625 --> 03:18:25.193
BECAUSE YOU CAN GIVE A THING YOU

03:18:25.260 --> 03:18:26.227
CAN TAKE IT.

03:18:26.294 --> 03:18:27.395
AND THAT THAT IS ALSO A

03:18:27.462 --> 03:18:30.331
CHALLENGING SITUATION I'M TO GET

03:18:30.398 --> 03:18:31.299
A BETTER UNDERSTANDING.

03:18:31.366 --> 03:18:33.468
OF WHAT ACTUALLY IS THE ISSUE

03:18:33.534 --> 03:18:34.969
NOW AND AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE I

03:18:35.036 --> 03:18:35.536
HAVEN'T BEEN ON A COMMUNITY

03:18:35.603 --> 03:18:37.005
COLLEGE FOR THE PAST WE WENT

03:18:37.071 --> 03:18:37.572
THROUGH SOME OF THE SIMILAR

03:18:37.639 --> 03:18:38.740
CONVERSATIONS RIGHT WHERE YOU

03:18:38.806 --> 03:18:39.841
HAVE AN EMPLOYEE WHO HAS BEEN

03:18:39.907 --> 03:18:41.542
THERE TWENTY FIVE YEARS --

03:18:41.609 --> 03:18:43.311
BECAUSE RACES WERE HELD BACK OR

03:18:43.378 --> 03:18:45.146
OR NOT HAPPENING IN A CERTAIN

03:18:45.213 --> 03:18:46.214
PERIOD IN TIME INSURGENTS MAY BE

03:18:46.281 --> 03:18:47.448
A LITTLE BIT A LITTLE BIT LONGER

03:18:47.515 --> 03:18:48.983
THAN THEN YOU'D WHICH FOR BUT

03:18:49.050 --> 03:18:52.287
YOU GIVE ME FULLER DATA.

03:18:52.353 --> 03:18:52.787
GO BACK AND FORTH THAT I

03:18:52.854 --> 03:18:53.688
APPRECIATE THAT BUT SO YOU MAY

03:18:53.755 --> 03:18:54.289
HAVE EMPLOYEES BUT TWENTY FIVE

03:18:54.355 --> 03:18:57.025
YEARS TEN YEARS -- WAGED AN

03:18:57.091 --> 03:18:57.692
INCREASE FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD OF

03:18:57.759 --> 03:19:00.128
TIME -- DOING MARKET THE OR

03:19:00.194 --> 03:19:01.596
SALARY SURVEYS APPOINT TIME WAIT

03:19:01.663 --> 03:19:03.498
JUST COME UP ON THE USUALLY MADE

03:19:03.564 --> 03:19:05.833
OF WITH SOME COMPARABLE SORT OF

03:19:05.900 --> 03:19:07.068
WORK FORCE AND EXPERIENCE AND

03:19:07.135 --> 03:19:08.503
AND TIME RIGHT.

03:19:08.569 --> 03:19:09.570
AND SO YOU GET EMPLOYEES TO COME

03:19:09.637 --> 03:19:15.310
IN AND MAKE A HIGHER WAGE -- IN

03:19:15.376 --> 03:19:15.910
MY MY QUESTION IS ASSEMBLY IN

03:19:15.977 --> 03:19:16.110
TIME.

03:19:16.177 --> 03:19:18.313
WHAT PREVENTS IT WHAT WHAT'S

03:19:18.379 --> 03:19:19.781
PREVENTING YOUR SIDE FROM

03:19:19.847 --> 03:19:22.817
ACTUALLY GETTING TO ACE A

03:19:22.884 --> 03:19:25.386
STELLAR THE SALARY STEP -- A

03:19:25.453 --> 03:19:27.522
PROPOSAL THAT ADDRESSES SOME OF

03:19:27.588 --> 03:19:28.623
THOSE ISSUES COULD.

03:19:28.690 --> 03:19:30.291
THAT DOES BECOME A PROBLEM NOW

03:19:30.358 --> 03:19:31.459
VERY DIFFERENT THIS YES YOU

03:19:31.526 --> 03:19:33.728
COULD DON'T HAVE A CSU NEXT DOOR

03:19:33.795 --> 03:19:34.562
THAT COMPETES TO YOU.

03:19:34.629 --> 03:19:36.631
UP IT'S PROBABLY THE COMMUNITY

03:19:36.698 --> 03:19:37.932
COLLEGES PREVALENT THAN A AND

03:19:37.999 --> 03:19:39.200
ANY PUBLIC AGENCY WILL BE LAW

03:19:39.267 --> 03:19:40.702
ENFORCEMENT OR WHAT HAVE YOU BUT

03:19:40.768 --> 03:19:41.969
THIS SEEMS TO BE A AN

03:19:42.036 --> 03:19:43.237
OVERWHELMING PROBLEM.

03:19:43.304 --> 03:19:44.939
AND CURES LIKE WHAT IS REALLY AT

03:19:45.006 --> 03:19:49.410
THE CRUX OF THE U. PREVENTING

03:19:49.477 --> 03:19:53.381
FROM DOING SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

03:19:53.448 --> 03:19:54.782
SATCHER I'LL TRY AND BE SIMPLE --

03:19:54.849 --> 03:19:55.750
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS

03:19:55.817 --> 03:19:57.518
WHICH YOU CAN ONLY MAKE SO

03:19:57.585 --> 03:19:58.553
SIMPLE.

03:19:58.619 --> 03:20:00.321
BUT ESSENTIALLY IT'S LIKE TRYING

03:20:00.388 --> 03:20:01.589
TO BOLT ON A PIECE FROM THE FORD

03:20:01.656 --> 03:20:03.424
ON TWO CHEVY AND EXPECTING IT TO

03:20:03.491 --> 03:20:04.359
WORK.

03:20:04.425 --> 03:20:07.695
WE HAVE AN OPEN RANGE SYSTEM.

03:20:07.762 --> 03:20:09.597
WE WOULD HAVE TO COMPLETELY RE

03:20:09.664 --> 03:20:12.066
ENGINEER ALL THE CLASSIFICATIONS

03:20:12.133 --> 03:20:13.835
AND THEN PLACE EVERY SINGLE

03:20:13.901 --> 03:20:15.403
EMPLOYEE.

03:20:15.470 --> 03:20:17.472
IN A NEWS AGNEW RANGE FOR THAT

03:20:17.538 --> 03:20:19.140
CLASSIFICATION TO GET SOMETHING

03:20:19.207 --> 03:20:21.042
SIMILAR. TO WHAT HAPPENS IN

03:20:21.109 --> 03:20:22.410
STATE CIVIL SERVICE.

03:20:22.477 --> 03:20:23.945
THEY HAVE SOME VERY NARROW

03:20:24.011 --> 03:20:27.248
RANGES WE HAVE RANGES WHICH GO I

03:20:27.315 --> 03:20:28.616
DIDN'T 50% OF THE MINIMUM.

03:20:28.683 --> 03:20:30.852
EMPLOYEES OBVIOUSLY WOULD WANT

03:20:30.918 --> 03:20:32.053
NOT TO BE.

03:20:32.120 --> 03:20:34.822
PUT DOWN TO BE PLACED ON A STEP

03:20:34.889 --> 03:20:36.924
THEY DON'T WANT TO PLACE THE

03:20:36.991 --> 03:20:37.825
FASTEST THE NATURAL RESPONSE.

03:20:37.892 --> 03:20:38.459
THE INITIAL COST TO DOING THAT

03:20:38.526 --> 03:20:41.095
WOULD BE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE.

03:20:41.162 --> 03:20:42.463
THIS ISSUE IS IS RANGE MOVEMENT

03:20:42.530 --> 03:20:43.831
AND AND NO AND I UNDERSTAND YOU

03:20:43.898 --> 03:20:45.333
WOULD IF YOU HIRED SOMEBODY

03:20:45.400 --> 03:20:47.402
LET'S SAY TEN BUT I'M GONNA USE

03:20:47.468 --> 03:20:48.503
NUMBERS THAT DON'T REALLY EXIST

03:20:48.569 --> 03:20:51.272
RIGHT BUT AT TEN BUCKS A YEAR.

03:20:51.339 --> 03:20:52.740
THAT ARE COMING IN AND PEOPLE

03:20:52.807 --> 03:20:54.675
WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING THERE FOR

03:20:54.742 --> 03:20:55.610
THIRTY YEARS AT AT TWO BOOKS

03:20:55.676 --> 03:20:57.245
YEARS CERTAINLY WOULD EXPECT

03:20:57.311 --> 03:20:58.713
THOSE AT TEN YEAR AND INSTEAD OF

03:20:58.780 --> 03:20:59.947
SAYING AT TEN YEARS.

03:21:00.014 --> 03:21:01.382
WHEN YOU DO A SATELLITE I'D

03:21:01.449 --> 03:21:03.317
RESURFACE A SUPPLE THE SAUDIS GO

03:21:03.384 --> 03:21:04.318
YOU WOULD EXPECT THE NEW HIRES

03:21:04.385 --> 03:21:05.787
TO COME BACK DOWN THEY HAVE TO

03:21:05.853 --> 03:21:06.788
STAY WHERE THEY'RE AT?

03:21:06.854 --> 03:21:08.055
BUT BUT I THINK THERE IS A THERE

03:21:08.122 --> 03:21:10.458
IS A WAY TO CONTACT NEGOTIATIONS

03:21:10.525 --> 03:21:11.292
TO BEGIN.

03:21:11.359 --> 03:21:12.894
THAT PROCESS WHEN WE DID IT WE

03:21:12.960 --> 03:21:14.362
CALL THE BUDGET ALLOCATION MODEL

03:21:14.429 --> 03:21:15.663
AND IT WAS GIVEN OVER A CERTAIN

03:21:15.730 --> 03:21:18.366
AMOUNT OF YEARS WHERE WE ALIGNED --

03:21:18.433 --> 03:21:20.134
A PRESIDENT TO A CAMPUS TO A

03:21:20.201 --> 03:21:21.269
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DEAN'S TO

03:21:21.335 --> 03:21:22.703
POPULATION AND START

03:21:22.770 --> 03:21:24.439
STANDARDIZING THAT FORMAT ALONG

03:21:24.505 --> 03:21:26.007
THE ROAD WHEN WE WERE DOING THAT

03:21:26.073 --> 03:21:27.208
WE WERE ALSO TAKE A LOOK AT

03:21:27.275 --> 03:21:29.644
SALARY SURVEYS -- WITHIN THE

03:21:29.710 --> 03:21:31.979
REGION TO TAKE TO TO ACCOUNT NO

03:21:32.046 --> 03:21:32.847
YOU CAN'T DO THIS OVERNIGHT I

03:21:32.914 --> 03:21:35.016
GET THAT AND AND EVEN IF WE

03:21:35.082 --> 03:21:36.551
WANTED TO TAKE CARE OF ALL THOSE

03:21:36.617 --> 03:21:37.051
THINGS THAT THE CONTRACT

03:21:37.118 --> 03:21:37.952
NEGOTIATION TABLE.

03:21:38.019 --> 03:21:39.153
IT WOULD ALMOST BE IMPOSSIBLE TO

03:21:39.220 --> 03:21:40.388
TAKE CARE OF THAT ONE PARTICULAR

03:21:40.455 --> 03:21:42.089
ISSUE AT ONE TIME.

03:21:42.156 --> 03:21:44.025
BUT BUT THERE CAN BE EVEN IF

03:21:44.091 --> 03:21:45.927
EVEN IF YOU WERE TO SAY LOOK WE

03:21:45.993 --> 03:21:47.195
CAN'T DO IT NOW.

03:21:47.261 --> 03:21:48.830
IS THERE STEPS OVER A CERTAIN

03:21:48.896 --> 03:21:50.264
AMOUNT OF YEARS THEY GET YOU TO

03:21:50.331 --> 03:21:52.333
A POINT SO YOU'RE NOT FACING

03:21:52.400 --> 03:22:00.541
THIS THIRTY YEARS TONIGHT I FACE

03:22:00.608 --> 03:22:01.409
IN THIS TEN YEARS FROM NOW.

03:22:01.476 --> 03:22:02.043
THAT WOULD BE A REASONABLE STEP

BARGAINING TO USE THE IN RANGE

03:22:43.918 --> 03:22:45.319
PROGRESSION.

03:22:47.188 --> 03:22:49.123
GOALS AND OBJECTIVES AND OVER

03:22:49.190 --> 03:22:50.458
THE LAST THREE TO FOUR YEARS

03:22:50.525 --> 03:22:51.959
WE'VE SAME AND BOTH THE NUMBER

03:22:52.026 --> 03:22:53.094
AND AMOUNTS OF THOSE IN RANGE

03:22:53.160 --> 03:22:55.162
PROGRESSIONS SUBSTANTIALLY

03:22:55.229 --> 03:22:58.599
INCREASE IT IS THAT WE HAVE BEEN

03:22:58.666 --> 03:22:58.933
ADDRESSING IT.

03:22:59.000 --> 03:22:59.667
MISTER CHAIR.

03:22:59.734 --> 03:23:01.869
IS THERE AN ESTIMATED TIME IN

03:23:01.936 --> 03:23:03.437
YOUR IN YOUR WORLD YOUR POINT OF

03:23:03.504 --> 03:23:04.906
VIEW IS AN ESTIMATED TIME WHERE

03:23:04.972 --> 03:23:07.542
THIS WOULD BE ADDRESSED RIGHT BE

03:23:07.608 --> 03:23:08.609
TEN YEARS LIKE WHAT WE DID IT WE

03:23:08.676 --> 03:23:10.044
KNEW THAT THERE WAS THREE PHASE.

03:23:10.111 --> 03:23:11.579
THREE PHASES WHAT HAPPENED OVER

03:23:11.646 --> 03:23:13.514
FIVE YEARS IN IN IF NOT THAT

03:23:13.581 --> 03:23:14.682
WOULD BE GIVEN AN EXTRA YEAR TO

03:23:14.749 --> 03:23:17.051
WRITE.

03:23:17.118 --> 03:23:19.220
SO IT IF IT THE I ASSUME YOU

03:23:19.287 --> 03:23:20.555
WANT TO DO IT AT THE CSU LEVEL

03:23:20.621 --> 03:23:21.122
NOT AFFECT NOT AT THE CAMPUS

03:23:21.188 --> 03:23:22.890
LEVEL BUT IT BUT HAVING SAID

03:23:22.957 --> 03:23:26.327
THAT -- WHAT RANGY YEARS?

03:23:26.394 --> 03:23:27.828
IN YOUR WORLD VIEW DO YOU THINK

03:23:27.895 --> 03:23:28.763
THAT THOSE.

03:23:28.829 --> 03:23:30.631
THAT THAT THOSE EQUITY ISSUES

03:23:30.698 --> 03:23:32.099
WOULD BE BECOME ADDRESSED AND

03:23:32.166 --> 03:23:32.934
THEN I WANT TO ASK YOU THE OTHER

03:23:33.000 --> 03:23:35.236
SIDE TOO BUT I'M CURIOUS AS TO

03:23:35.303 --> 03:23:36.203
WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THAT.

03:23:36.270 --> 03:23:38.039
IF SIR I MENTIONED WE'VE HAD

03:23:38.105 --> 03:23:39.540
WE'VE GOT A MEETING OF A THE

03:23:39.607 --> 03:23:41.709
UNION AND ADMINISTRATION TO TALK

03:23:41.776 --> 03:23:43.044
ABOUT SALARY STRUCTURE.

03:23:43.110 --> 03:23:44.545
THE PROPOSAL IS OVER THE COURSE

03:23:44.612 --> 03:23:46.247
OF THE NEXT YEAR WE'LL COME UP

03:23:46.314 --> 03:23:47.648
WITH SOME JOINT RECOMMENDATIONS

03:23:47.715 --> 03:23:48.749
AND TAKE THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS

03:23:48.816 --> 03:23:50.284
INTO BARGAINING.

03:23:50.351 --> 03:23:51.786
SO THE IDEA THAT WE'RE NOT.

03:23:51.852 --> 03:23:54.055
ONLY WILLING TO TALK ABOUT THIS

03:23:54.121 --> 03:23:55.590
IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING BUT

03:23:55.656 --> 03:23:56.657
ALSO THE FACT THAT WE'RE TALKING

03:23:56.724 --> 03:23:58.125
THIS OFF CYCLE BECAUSE WE

03:23:58.192 --> 03:24:00.361
RECOGNIZE THIS IS A NOW ISSUE.

03:24:00.428 --> 03:24:02.597
RATHER THAN PUTTING OFF I THINK

03:24:02.663 --> 03:24:04.031
YOU SHOULD GIVE THIS COMMITTEE

03:24:04.098 --> 03:24:04.999
SOME REASSURANCE OF THE SEA

03:24:05.066 --> 03:24:07.068
ISSUE IS TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS.

03:24:07.134 --> 03:24:09.904
IT WILL TAKE MULTIPLE YEARS.

03:24:09.971 --> 03:24:11.939
IF THE OBJECTIVE IS TO GET

03:24:12.006 --> 03:24:15.743
EVERYBODY EQUAL OR DIFFERENTIAL

03:24:15.810 --> 03:24:17.945
BUT AS YOU POINTED OUT WE WE ARE

03:24:18.012 --> 03:24:19.480
DRIVEN BY MARKET FORCES.

03:24:19.547 --> 03:24:21.749
WHEN WE HIRE PEOPLE SAN DIEGO

03:24:21.816 --> 03:24:23.985
SAN JOSE SAN FRANCISCO IN A

03:24:24.051 --> 03:24:26.053
BOOMING ECONOMY WE HAVE TO PAY

03:24:26.120 --> 03:24:27.622
MARKET SALARIES?

03:24:27.688 --> 03:24:29.056
AND THEN WHAT WE ENCOURAGE ALL

03:24:29.123 --> 03:24:30.658
OUR CAMPUSES TO DO ALL THEIR

03:24:30.725 --> 03:24:32.126
HATE SHODDY POINT MINUTES IS

03:24:32.193 --> 03:24:33.027
LOOK AT THE SORRY OF THAT NEW

03:24:33.094 --> 03:24:35.463
HIRE LOOK AT THE CLASSIFICATION.

03:24:35.529 --> 03:24:36.564
AND USE THE IN RANGE PROGRESSION

03:24:36.631 --> 03:24:38.532
MECHANISM TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:24:38.599 --> 03:24:39.166
THERE ARE NO IT.

03:24:39.233 --> 03:24:41.469
OR THE INEQUITIES A MITIGATED OR

03:24:41.535 --> 03:24:47.041
READY KATE.

03:24:47.108 --> 03:24:48.042
SO ALL OF THESE.

03:24:48.109 --> 03:24:50.645
PROCESSES IN RANGE PROGRESSION

03:24:50.711 --> 03:24:52.346
CAMPUS EQUITY PROGRAMS I WILL BE

03:24:52.413 --> 03:24:53.814
AN EMPLOYEE NOW. TO ADDRESS

03:24:53.881 --> 03:24:56.917
THESE ISSUES.

03:24:56.984 --> 03:24:59.320
IN THE FUTURE OF A NIGHT.

03:24:59.387 --> 03:25:01.222
WRAP IT UP YES.

03:25:01.288 --> 03:25:02.423
BUT IT ON ON BEING ON YOUR SIDE

03:25:02.490 --> 03:25:03.491
OF AT ONE POINT IN TIME WE ALSO

03:25:03.557 --> 03:25:04.925
KNEW THAT OVER A CERTAIN AMOUNT

03:25:04.992 --> 03:25:05.726
OF YEARS.

03:25:05.793 --> 03:25:06.761
BY DEFAULT THE AGE AND LONGEVITY

03:25:06.827 --> 03:25:07.395
THROUGH THE DISTRICT THERE'D BE

03:25:07.461 --> 03:25:08.062
A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT

03:25:08.129 --> 03:25:09.096
WOULD NO LONGER BE THERE BY THE

03:25:09.163 --> 03:25:10.865
TIME WE GOT THE LAST PHASE SO WE

03:25:10.931 --> 03:25:12.199
ALWAYS KNEW THAT THERE BE A

03:25:12.266 --> 03:25:13.868
CERTAIN SAVINGS A DOLLARS.

03:25:13.934 --> 03:25:15.670
IF WE PUT A SALARY.

03:25:15.736 --> 03:25:18.105
A SKILL TOGETHER BECAUSE THE BY

03:25:18.172 --> 03:25:19.674
THE TIME WE GOT THERE ARE SOME

03:25:19.740 --> 03:25:20.775
OF THOSE PEOPLE WOULD NEVER MAKE

03:25:20.841 --> 03:25:23.911
IT TO TO A CERTAIN SCALE.

03:25:23.978 --> 03:25:25.046
BUT BECAUSE RETIREMENT ISSUES.

03:25:25.112 --> 03:25:26.380
SO SO THOSE NUMBERS AREN'T

03:25:26.447 --> 03:25:28.182
REALLY APPLE THE APPLE NUMBERS

03:25:28.249 --> 03:25:29.016
RIGHT BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE

03:25:29.083 --> 03:25:30.685
DAY THERE'S SOME POPULATION THAT

03:25:30.751 --> 03:25:32.019
YOU KNOW OVER.

03:25:32.086 --> 03:25:34.088
TIME IS GONNA MAKE IT TO THE HOW

03:25:34.155 --> 03:25:35.556
TO THE HEIGHTS OURS SCALE ANYHOW.

03:25:35.623 --> 03:25:37.692
THE END ON TALK ABOUT THOSE

03:25:37.758 --> 03:25:38.325
EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN THERE FOR A

03:25:38.392 --> 03:25:39.393
LONG PERIOD OF TIME.

03:25:39.460 --> 03:25:41.362
NO ONE ASKED IF I WANT ONE MORE

03:25:41.429 --> 03:25:42.530
QUESTION I KNOW ONE DUDE.

03:25:42.596 --> 03:25:43.597
THE OTHER SIDE.

03:25:43.664 --> 03:25:44.265
WHY ARE THEY NOT SEEING THE SAME

03:25:44.331 --> 03:25:46.600
WHAT WOULD THEY DO NOT SEE THE

03:25:46.667 --> 03:25:53.607
SAME THING?

03:25:53.674 --> 03:25:54.375
HI I AGREE WITH SOME OF THE

03:25:54.442 --> 03:25:54.975
COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE

03:25:55.042 --> 03:25:55.976
HERE THAT THIS IS NOT THE BEST

03:25:56.043 --> 03:25:57.478
PLACE FOR NEGOTIATION.

03:25:57.545 --> 03:25:59.180
AND THIS IS SHOULDN'T BE

03:25:59.246 --> 03:26:04.485
NEGOTIATION -- SO. FOR THE LIMIT

03:26:04.552 --> 03:26:07.388
OF FOR FOR THE FOR TIMES SAY.

03:26:07.455 --> 03:26:08.355
BECAUSE I THINK WE COULD SIT

03:26:08.422 --> 03:26:10.458
HERE AND AND BE HERE ALL NIGHT

03:26:10.524 --> 03:26:11.992
DISCUSSING THESE THINGS.

03:26:12.059 --> 03:26:14.095
I I THINK THERE'S BEEN VERY GOOD

03:26:14.161 --> 03:26:15.596
DISCUSSION POINTS WELL TAKEN

03:26:15.663 --> 03:26:18.032
FROM BOTH SIDES OF POINTS TO BE

03:26:18.099 --> 03:26:19.633
NOTED BY BOTH SIDES.

03:26:19.700 --> 03:26:21.669
AND AND I WOULD IF PERMISSION

03:26:21.736 --> 03:26:24.438
WITH THE COMMITTEE -- FOR FOR

03:26:24.505 --> 03:26:26.040
TIME'S SAKE WE STILL HAVE A

03:26:26.107 --> 03:26:28.909
BELIEVE TEN MORE BILLS TO HEAR --

03:26:28.976 --> 03:26:30.344
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT SO I

03:26:30.411 --> 03:26:31.345
APOLOGIZE MISTER JONES GOING TO

03:26:31.412 --> 03:26:31.812
ASK.

03:26:31.879 --> 03:26:33.147
I WAS GONNA ASK THE PROPONENTS

03:26:33.214 --> 03:26:34.448
OF THE BILL IS HERE'S A QUESTION

03:26:34.515 --> 03:26:35.316
SO I APOLOGIZE AGAIN.

03:26:35.382 --> 03:26:37.651
SO WHAT WITH THAT IF IF THE

03:26:37.718 --> 03:26:38.819
COMMITTEE PERMITS I'M GOING TO

03:26:38.886 --> 03:26:44.391
ASK THE AUTHOR TO CLUBS THANK

03:26:44.458 --> 03:26:46.327
YOU VERY MUCH -- LET ME GO BACK

03:26:46.393 --> 03:26:47.595
TO WHERE WE STARTED.

03:26:47.661 --> 03:26:48.395
IS WHERE WE WANT IT WHERE THEY

03:26:48.462 --> 03:26:49.296
WERE GOING TO GO THERE A LOT OF

03:26:49.363 --> 03:26:49.864
ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED

03:26:49.930 --> 03:26:50.498
THAT ARE NOT WITHIN THE PURVIEW

03:26:50.564 --> 03:26:52.032
OF THIS BILL FIRST OF ALL.

03:26:52.099 --> 03:26:53.567
I MEAN THE WHOLE ISSUE OF TRYING

03:26:53.634 --> 03:26:55.603
TO RE DESIGN THE ENTIRE SYSTEM

03:26:55.669 --> 03:26:56.704
TO DEAL WITH IT.

03:26:56.771 --> 03:26:58.038
EQUITY IN SALARIES AND PEOPLE

03:26:58.105 --> 03:26:59.740
BEING HIRED AND ADMINISTRATORS

03:26:59.807 --> 03:27:00.307
AND ALL THIS KIND OF THING

03:27:00.374 --> 03:27:01.842
THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS

03:27:01.909 --> 03:27:04.145
ABOUT WE KNOW THAT -- THIS BILL

03:27:04.211 --> 03:27:06.013
IS ABOUT EIGHT EIGHT A GROUP OF

03:27:06.080 --> 03:27:08.415
OF EMPLOYEES AT THE CSU SYSTEM.

03:27:08.482 --> 03:27:13.120
WHO HAD A A 5% OF STEP PROGRAM

03:27:13.187 --> 03:27:15.489
TAKEN AWAY NOT BECAUSE THEY

03:27:15.556 --> 03:27:16.924
BARGAINED FOR BUT WAS TAKEN AWAY?

03:27:16.991 --> 03:27:18.459
AND NOW THE QUESTION BECOMES DO

03:27:18.526 --> 03:27:20.394
WE GO BACK AND BARGAIN TO GET IT

03:27:20.461 --> 03:27:21.262
BACK WHEN IT WAS GIVEN TO BEEN

03:27:21.328 --> 03:27:23.063
WAS THERE'S IN THE FIRST PLACE.

03:27:23.130 --> 03:27:24.265
IT IS NICE TO HEAR ALL OF THE

03:27:24.331 --> 03:27:25.800
CONVERSATION ABOUT EVERYBODY

03:27:25.866 --> 03:27:27.067
AROUND BUT THIS IS REALLY ABOUT

03:27:27.134 --> 03:27:28.636
A SPECIFIC GROUP OF PEOPLE.

03:27:28.702 --> 03:27:30.371
WHO WANT TO TALK ABOUT HAVING A

03:27:30.437 --> 03:27:32.339
MERIT SALARY SYSTEM PLACE BACK

03:27:32.406 --> 03:27:33.941
IN THE OTHER SYSTEMS OTHER

03:27:34.008 --> 03:27:35.142
EMPLOYEES HAVE IN THE STATE OF

03:27:35.209 --> 03:27:36.877
CALIFORNIA AND OTHER EMPLOYEES

03:27:36.944 --> 03:27:38.179
HAVE A TO SEE ISSUE SYSTEM?

03:27:38.245 --> 03:27:41.115
THAT WAS IN PLACE AND BOB EVEN

03:27:41.182 --> 03:27:42.550
WITH THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE

03:27:42.616 --> 03:27:43.584
GOVERNOR LAST YEAR THERE'S BEEN

03:27:43.651 --> 03:27:44.718
NO EFFORT TO GO BACK AND HAVE

03:27:44.785 --> 03:27:45.753
THIS CONVERSATION.

03:27:45.820 --> 03:27:47.087
AND THE GOVERNOR WAS HESITANT

03:27:47.154 --> 03:27:47.988
BECAUSE HE SAID THIS SHOULD BE

03:27:48.055 --> 03:27:49.223
DONE WITHIN COLLECTIVE

03:27:49.290 --> 03:27:50.090
BARGAINING AND MOST OF US FEEL

03:27:50.157 --> 03:27:50.925
THAT WAY.

03:27:50.991 --> 03:27:51.859
BUT THEY HAVE TRIED AND TRIED

03:27:51.926 --> 03:27:52.860
AND TRIED AND SO WHEN THE

03:27:52.927 --> 03:27:53.794
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING SYSTEM

03:27:53.861 --> 03:27:55.696
DOESN'T COME BACK TO NEGOTIATE

03:27:55.763 --> 03:27:57.865
THIS WHAT DO YOU DO YOU JUST SAY

03:27:57.932 --> 03:27:59.166
WHATEVER AT SOME OF THE PEOPLE

03:27:59.233 --> 03:28:00.401
HAVE SAID IT RETIRED AND MOVED

03:28:00.467 --> 03:28:02.169
ON AND JUST SAY THE SYSTEM.

03:28:02.236 --> 03:28:03.637
IS NOT GONNA WORK FOR ME OR DO

03:42:06.246 --> 03:42:08.882
WITH ONE EMPLOYER AND ARE

03:42:08.948 --> 03:42:09.716
STARTING WITH ANOTHER.

03:42:09.783 --> 03:42:10.917
SO WE DID GET THAT BILL PASSED

03:42:10.984 --> 03:42:12.652
WE GOT A THREE YEAR WE'RE HOPING

03:42:12.719 --> 03:42:14.087
FOR A FIVE YEAR BUT A THREE YEAR

03:42:14.154 --> 03:42:15.121
PERIOD.

03:42:15.188 --> 03:42:16.423
THINK WE ONE OF THE FIVE BECAUSE

03:42:16.489 --> 03:42:18.058
WE THOUGHT THAN ANY REEMPLOYMENT

03:42:18.124 --> 03:42:19.626
RIGHTS THEY MIGHT HAVE A PART

03:42:19.693 --> 03:42:20.960
TIME FACULTY MEMBER THOSE WOULD

03:42:21.027 --> 03:42:22.262
HAVE EXPIRED AND THAT WOULD HAVE

03:42:22.328 --> 03:42:23.363
BEEN OKAY.

03:42:23.430 --> 03:42:24.831
BUT THE REALITY IS THAT PEOPLE

03:42:24.898 --> 03:42:26.633
DON'T THINK ABOUT THIS ISSUE

03:42:26.700 --> 03:42:28.134
UNTIL THEY GET TO RETIREMENT.

03:42:28.201 --> 03:42:29.436
AND A LOT OF TIME MAY HAVE

03:42:29.502 --> 03:42:31.271
PASSED BETWEEN ASSIGNMENTS AND

03:42:31.337 --> 03:42:32.305
OTHER DISTRICTS.

03:42:32.372 --> 03:42:33.907
IT'S DIFFICULT EVEN FOR FULL

03:42:33.973 --> 03:42:35.175
TIMERS BUT IT'S JUST.

03:42:35.241 --> 03:42:37.577
IMPOSSIBLE FOR PART TIMERS TO

03:42:37.644 --> 03:42:39.813
KNOW THAT THEY SHOULD TRANSFER

03:42:39.879 --> 03:42:40.513
THEIR SICK LEAVE.

03:42:40.580 --> 03:42:42.248
SO ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS BACK

03:42:42.315 --> 03:42:43.049
THEN WHEN WE WERE DOING THAT

03:42:43.116 --> 03:42:45.151
OTHER BILL WAS THE DISTRICTS

03:42:45.218 --> 03:42:47.353
SAID -- WE DON'T KEEP THOSE

03:42:47.420 --> 03:42:49.489
RECORDS WELL THEY DO KEEP THOSE

03:42:49.556 --> 03:42:51.324
RECORDS AND I'VE JUST RETIRED A

03:42:51.391 --> 03:42:52.625
LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO.

03:42:52.692 --> 03:42:54.160
I GOT INFORMATION BACK FROM

03:42:54.227 --> 03:42:55.829
LAUSD WHERE I STARTED AT

03:42:55.895 --> 03:42:57.831
CRENSHAW HIGH SCHOOL TAUGHT FOR

03:42:57.897 --> 03:43:01.067
FOUR YEARS.

03:43:01.134 --> 03:43:01.668

03:43:02.669 --> 03:43:05.205
BUT THEY FOUND MY UNUSED SICK

03:43:05.271 --> 03:43:06.740
LEAVE THAT I COULD TRANSFER NEWS

03:43:06.806 --> 03:43:07.474
FOR RETIREMENT.

03:43:07.540 --> 03:43:09.542
SO THIS IS THIS CAN BE DONE IT

03:43:09.609 --> 03:43:11.478
SHOULD BE DONE -- WHEN I WORKED

03:43:11.544 --> 03:43:13.113

04:11:34.646 --> 04:11:35.647
TO SEE AN ADVOCATE SEE WHEN YOU

04:11:35.713 --> 04:11:38.049
COMPARE IT TO THE CSU AND YOU

04:11:38.116 --> 04:11:39.417
SEE SYSTEM.

04:11:39.484 --> 04:11:42.020
WHO RECEIVES A TIME FROM A TON

04:11:42.086 --> 04:11:42.587
OF MORE MONEY THAN WE DO?

04:11:42.654 --> 04:11:43.588
AND THEY'RE ABLE TO DO SO MUCH

04:11:43.655 --> 04:11:45.490
MORE AND IN COMPARISON TO THAT

04:11:45.557 --> 04:11:47.192
WE'RE JUST STRUGGLING.

04:11:47.258 --> 04:11:48.927
TO REALLY HAVE A VOICE IS SET UP

04:11:48.993 --> 04:11:50.695
TO THE CAPITOL IN SACRAMENTO --

04:11:50.762 --> 04:11:52.063
OCCASIONALLY WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO

04:11:52.130 --> 04:11:54.032
GO TO WASHINGTON DC AND SO YOU

04:11:54.098 --> 04:11:55.200
SEE THE DISPARITY WHEN YOU

04:11:55.266 --> 04:11:57.769
COMPARE THOSE. THREE SYSTEMS --

04:11:57.836 --> 04:11:59.437
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU BREAK IT

04:11:59.504 --> 04:12:02.006
DOWN TO THE REGIONAL LEVEL --

04:12:02.073 --> 04:12:03.575
AND SO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

04:12:03.641 --> 04:12:05.810

04:12:05.877 --> 04:12:08.112
ASIA SAID ON AYE AYSHA OF

04:12:08.179 --> 04:12:10.081
OVERSEAS EVERYTHING IN BUT WHEN

04:12:10.148 --> 04:12:11.883
IT COMES TO THE REGIONS --

04:12:11.950 --> 04:12:13.952
MYSELF REPRESENTING VISION FOR

04:12:14.018 --> 04:12:15.787
AS THE REGIONAL AFFAIRS DR -- WE

04:12:15.854 --> 04:12:18.089
HAVE OUR OWN INDIVIDUAL BUDGET

04:12:18.156 --> 04:12:20.024
AND THAT BUDGET IS VERY VERY

04:12:20.091 --> 04:12:22.393
SMALL AND WE MAKE THE BEST WITH

04:12:22.460 --> 04:12:23.528
WHAT WE HAVE.

04:12:23.595 --> 04:12:24.762
BUT THAT ALSO LIMITS OUR

04:12:24.829 --> 04:12:27.398
CAPABILITY AND HOSTING EVENTS --

04:12:27.465 --> 04:12:29.234
GOING TO CONFERENCES --

04:12:29.300 --> 04:12:31.002
ATTENDING DIFFERENT CONFERENCES

04:12:31.069 --> 04:12:32.370
THAT MAY BE TOO FAR AWAY AND

04:12:32.437 --> 04:12:34.873
REQUIRE EXTENSIVE TRAVEL AND WE

04:12:34.939 --> 04:12:37.442

FOR THIS BILL OF PASSES SO THAT

04:14:39.497 --> 04:14:40.298
WILL.

04:14:40.365 --> 04:14:41.633
ELIMINATE THE REQUIREMENT OF

04:14:41.699 --> 04:14:44.235
DESTROYING THE SENATE TO VOTE

04:14:44.302 --> 04:14:45.203
THAT THE THROUGH THE ELECTION

04:14:45.269 --> 04:14:47.205
NIGHT FOR ANY ASSESSMENT FEES

04:14:52.744 --> 04:14:54.512
MORE ON THAT.

04:14:54.579 --> 04:14:56.581
NO SO WHAT THIS. TO DO SO

04:14:56.648 --> 04:14:57.849
CURRENTLY IN ED COAT THE WAY

04:14:57.915 --> 04:14:59.317
THAT THE FEES IMPLEMENTED ON

04:14:59.384 --> 04:15:01.352
CAMPUS IS THAT EACH A HUNDRED

04:15:01.419 --> 04:15:02.420
AND FOURTEEN ASSOC.

04:15:02.487 --> 04:15:04.622
BUT STUDENT BODIES HAVE TO VOTE

04:15:04.689 --> 04:15:05.690
ON IT IN.

04:15:05.757 --> 04:15:07.225
IT'S IT'S LIKE STRENUOUSLY LIKE

04:15:07.291 --> 04:15:09.427
DOESN'T WORK SO THIS WOULD

04:15:09.494 --> 04:15:10.995
IMPLEMENT THE FEE AS I OPT OUT

04:15:11.062 --> 04:15:12.330
SO STUDENTS STILL HAVE THE

04:15:12.397 --> 04:15:16.501
ABILITY TO OPT OUT FROM THE FEE.

04:15:16.567 --> 04:15:17.969
OKAY I WONDER IF INDIVIDUAL

04:15:18.036 --> 04:15:19.370
STUDENTS.

04:15:19.437 --> 04:15:22.573
INDIVIDUALS.

04:15:22.640 --> 04:15:23.675
TO THIS ELECTION IS SO WHAT THE

04:15:23.741 --> 04:15:28.713
CAMPUS BASED -- ARE SYSTEM WIDE.

04:15:28.780 --> 04:15:30.381
THE SPACE CAMPUS BASED.

04:15:30.448 --> 04:15:32.850
MONA STERN SENATE MEMBERS MIGHT

04:15:32.917 --> 04:15:34.385
KNOW THE WHOLE STUDENT BODY

04:15:34.452 --> 04:15:35.920
HOLSTER ON BODY I SEE.

04:15:35.987 --> 04:15:38.856
SO IT HAS -- GIVEN YOU --

04:15:38.923 --> 04:15:42.226
DIFFICULTY TO ROUTE TO CHARGE

04:15:42.293 --> 04:15:49.534
TWO DOLLARS.

04:15:49.600 --> 04:15:50.401
YEAH IF I MAY.

04:15:50.468 --> 04:15:52.236
RESPOND MOST RECENTLY.

04:15:52.303 --> 04:15:53.504
AS A ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY AND

04:15:53.571 --> 04:15:56.307
I HAVE BEEN WORKING AND SUB ONE

04:15:56.374 --> 04:15:59.177
ON ON TRYING TO REFORM OF THE

04:15:59.243 --> 04:16:01.979
CAL GRANT -- PROGRAM -- WE'VE

04:16:02.046 --> 04:16:05.817
SEEN STUDENTS COME FROM UC CSU.

04:16:05.883 --> 04:16:07.318
IN LARGE NUMBERS.

04:16:07.385 --> 04:16:08.653
AND I THINK THEY COME IN LARGE

04:16:08.720 --> 04:16:10.455
NUMBERS BECAUSE THEY HAVE A

04:16:10.521 --> 04:16:12.523
SYSTEM IN PLACE FOR STUDENT

04:16:12.590 --> 04:16:14.058
REPRESENTATION THEIR STUDENT

04:16:14.125 --> 04:16:16.060
ORGANIZATIONS THAT REPRESENT

04:16:16.127 --> 04:16:17.295
THEM.

04:16:17.361 --> 04:16:19.130
A MOBILIZE THE STUDENTS AT BOTH

04:16:19.197 --> 04:16:21.499
OF THOSE SYSTEMS AND WHEN WE HAD

04:16:21.566 --> 04:16:23.334
TWO DIFFERENT DAYS ONE FOR CSU

04:16:23.401 --> 04:16:24.802
STUDENTS.

04:16:24.869 --> 04:16:26.370
AND ONE FOR UC'S STUDENTS AND

04:16:26.437 --> 04:16:31.442
THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF STUDENTS.

04:16:31.509 --> 04:16:34.479
FROM EACH OF THOSE -- IT SYSTEMS

04:16:34.545 --> 04:16:34.846
ON THOSE DAYS.

04:16:34.912 --> 04:16:36.547
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO TRYING TO

04:16:36.614 --> 04:16:39.117
GET COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS

04:16:39.183 --> 04:16:42.453
HERE -- TOO ALSO LOBBY ON ON

04:16:42.520 --> 04:16:44.388
ISSUES THAT ARE MOST AFFECTING

04:16:44.455 --> 04:16:46.891
THEM IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET

04:16:46.958 --> 04:16:48.626
STUDENTS TO COME HERE.

04:16:48.693 --> 04:16:49.961
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE

04:16:50.027 --> 04:16:52.663
EQUIVALENT KIND OF ORGANIZATIONS

04:16:52.730 --> 04:16:54.599
BECAUSE IT IS SO DIFFICULT FOR

04:16:54.665 --> 04:16:56.000
THEM TO IMPOSE.

04:16:56.067 --> 04:16:58.069
THIS TO DOLLAR FEES THAT WOULD

04:16:58.136 --> 04:16:59.504
HELP THEM ORGANIZE.

04:16:59.570 --> 04:17:02.840
SO I I I I SEE THAT AS A THE

04:17:02.907 --> 04:17:03.975
REASON WHY THIS BILL IS IS

04:17:04.041 --> 04:17:05.777
NEEDED.

04:17:05.843 --> 04:17:08.813
YEAH I UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR

04:17:08.880 --> 04:17:10.882
THE FUND FOR THE SPIRIT.

04:17:10.948 --> 04:17:13.951
STUDENT REPRESENTATIVES OF TOTAL

04:17:14.018 --> 04:17:15.386
WATER LAPPING WORK.

04:17:15.453 --> 04:17:22.627
AND WORK WITH THE CAPITAL APPEAR

04:17:22.693 --> 04:17:24.862
A WEAVER.

04:17:24.929 --> 04:17:26.063
I AM A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED

04:17:26.130 --> 04:17:28.566
ABOUT THE ELIMINATING THE

04:17:28.633 --> 04:17:30.134
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.

04:17:30.201 --> 04:17:31.669
AND THE GOVERNMENT IS SUCH

04:17:31.736 --> 04:17:33.905
TRYING TO IMPOSE.

04:17:33.971 --> 04:17:34.806
YOU YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO VOTE

04:17:34.872 --> 04:17:37.775
THE DETERMINE THAT YOU OR YOUR

04:17:37.842 --> 04:17:39.944
OWN SHE SAID IN THE WE MANDATING

04:17:40.011 --> 04:17:41.078
THEM.

04:17:41.145 --> 04:17:43.114
JUST THE TWO CHARGES ANY STORE

04:17:43.181 --> 04:17:44.849
IN TWO DOLLARS EVEN THOUGH

04:17:44.916 --> 04:17:47.051
THAT'S A SMALL AMOUNT.

04:17:47.118 --> 04:17:48.686
AND THEN A THAT'S MY FEELING AND

04:17:48.753 --> 04:17:49.687
THE SECOND SECOND QUESTION IS

04:17:49.754 --> 04:17:51.823
THAT THE US YES YOU AND DO YOU

04:17:51.889 --> 04:17:54.659
SEE IT -- STUDENTS SO DO THEY

04:17:54.725 --> 04:17:56.961
DETERMINE THE FEES SO ARE HAVE

04:17:57.028 --> 04:17:59.130
WE DECIDED THEIR FEES I I I

04:17:59.197 --> 04:18:00.832
DON'T KNOW FOR SURE DOCTOR CHOI

04:18:00.898 --> 04:18:02.300
BUT I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF

04:18:02.366 --> 04:18:03.401
THE STUDENTS.

04:18:03.467 --> 04:18:04.836
DON'T DETERMINE THE FEE

04:18:04.902 --> 04:18:07.238
THEMSELVES BUT I I I DON'T KNOW

04:18:07.305 --> 04:18:10.942
ABSOLUTELY -- THIS IS STUDENTS

04:18:11.008 --> 04:18:12.543
AND THE STUDENT ORGANIZATION.

04:18:12.610 --> 04:18:15.246
I THINK THAT SPEAK ON BEHALF OF

04:18:15.313 --> 04:18:17.248
STUDENTS -- TRYING TO MAKE IT

04:18:17.315 --> 04:18:25.223
EASIER -- FOR THEM TO HAVE

04:18:25.289 --> 04:18:30.428
BETTER REPRESENTATION HE I YEAH

04:18:30.494 --> 04:18:32.063
I HEARD THEM -- BUT THE THIS IS

04:18:32.129 --> 04:18:33.564
SO IN THE SPIRIT OF WHAT A

04:18:33.631 --> 04:18:34.198
DEMOCRACY.

04:18:34.265 --> 04:18:35.867
IS A SELF GOVERNING AND THE HERE

04:18:35.933 --> 04:18:36.968
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS A STATE

04:18:37.034 --> 04:18:38.669
LEGISLATURE TRIED TO TELL THEM

04:18:38.736 --> 04:18:41.072
MICHAEL MANAGING STUDENTS --

04:18:41.138 --> 04:18:44.141
DECISION ON FEES RIGHT AND AN

04:18:44.208 --> 04:18:45.676
END TO THAT I I WOULD.

04:18:45.743 --> 04:18:47.979
JUST SAY THIS THIS WAS NOT A

04:18:48.045 --> 04:18:52.383
BILL THAT I THOUGHT UP THIS WAS

04:18:52.450 --> 04:18:52.683
NOT A BILL.

04:18:52.750 --> 04:18:52.884
THAT.

04:18:52.950 --> 04:18:55.453
I THOUGHT OF THE STUDENTS CAME

04:18:55.519 --> 04:18:56.787
TO ME.

04:18:56.854 --> 04:18:58.522
AND ASKS ME.

04:18:58.589 --> 04:18:59.957
I THINK FOR THE REASONS THAT

04:19:00.024 --> 04:19:01.425
DAVE EXPRESS.

04:19:01.492 --> 04:19:02.693
IF I WOULD.
