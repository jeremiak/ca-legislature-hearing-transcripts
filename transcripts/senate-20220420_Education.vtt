00:15:13.846 --> 00:15:15.948
SIGNIFICANT POLICY CHANGE. THAT

WAYS TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL AND

00:15:38.804 --> 00:15:39.638
THOSE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED

00:15:39.705 --> 00:15:41.206

00:22:26.611 --> 00:22:29.247
KNOW WHY FROM HONESTLY FROM THE

00:22:29.314 --> 00:22:30.749
DAY ONE WHEN I SAW THE BILL IN

00:22:30.816 --> 00:22:33.819
PRINT- FILTER A COMPELLING NEED

00:22:33.885 --> 00:22:36.021
TO SUPPORT IT. SO THANK YOU

00:22:36.088 --> 00:22:38.890
THANK YOU CENTER CORTESE CENTER

00:22:38.957 --> 00:22:41.193
GLAZER. AS CHAIR- THIS IS A- YOU

00:22:41.259 --> 00:22:42.828
KNOW ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

00:22:42.894 --> 00:22:44.863
BILLS THAT I THINK THAT I HAVE

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:45.564
FACED IN MY TIME ON THE

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:47.632
EDUCATION COMMITTEE AND I KNOW-

00:22:47.699 --> 00:22:48.533
IN APPRECIATION TO THE AUTHOR

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.636
FOR- DIGGING DOWN INTO THE SPACE

00:22:51.703 --> 00:22:53.638
AND- SALON COMFORTABLE BECAUSE-

00:22:53.705 --> 00:22:55.540
CONSEQUENCES THERE. ARE BIG ON

00:22:55.607 --> 00:22:57.442
IT AS- MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE SAN

00:22:57.509 --> 00:22:59.578
JOSE AREA. HAS SAID THAT THE

00:22:59.644 --> 00:23:01.680
PERFECT SHOULDN'T BE GOOD TO THE

00:23:01.747 --> 00:23:03.415
PERFECT SHOULD NOT GET IN THE

00:23:03.482 --> 00:23:05.383
WAY OF THE GOOD. AND I THINK

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:06.251
THAT- ARE THERE STILL SOME

00:23:06.318 --> 00:23:07.452
QUESTIONS HERE OF COURSE THERE

00:23:07.519 --> 00:23:10.655
ARE AND- SOME. ANXIETY ABOUT

00:23:10.722 --> 00:23:12.257
THIS CHANGE IN UNDERSTANDING ALL

00:23:12.324 --> 00:23:13.391
THE CONSEQUENCES OF COURSE.

00:23:13.458 --> 00:23:16.528
THERE ARE- HI- BUT I WOULD SAY

00:23:16.595 --> 00:23:18.563
THIS THAT- IF THIS BILL MOVES

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:21.366
FORWARD TODAY I'M GOING TO

00:23:21.433 --> 00:23:22.367
SUPPORT IT MOVING FORWARD TODAY.

00:23:22.434 --> 00:23:24.069
THAT THIS COMMITTEE- HAS THE

00:23:24.136 --> 00:23:26.004
ABILITY TO COULD TO LOOK MORE

00:23:26.071 --> 00:23:27.038
DEEPLY IN THIS AREA HAVE MORE

00:23:27.105 --> 00:23:28.607
HEARINGS. I THINK ONE OF THE

00:23:28.673 --> 00:23:30.475
THINGS THAT WE- DON'T DO ENOUGH

00:23:30.542 --> 00:23:32.744
AROUND HERE IS SLOW THINGS DOWN

00:23:32.811 --> 00:23:34.846
AND HAVE THAT FURTHER STUDY. NOW

00:23:34.913 --> 00:23:36.047
I THINK THAT COULD HAPPEN THIS

00:23:36.114 --> 00:23:37.549
YEAR. I DON'T THINK IT MEANS

00:23:37.616 --> 00:23:39.551
THAT WE STOP. A BILL THAT I

00:23:39.618 --> 00:23:41.653
THINK IS IT IN GOOD ENOUGH SHAPE

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.522
FOR MOVING FOR BUT I THINK THAT

00:23:43.588 --> 00:23:44.723
WE CAN. HAVE MORE HEARINGS AND I

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:46.525
WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT. TO

00:23:46.591 --> 00:23:47.058
UNDERSTAND THIS ISSUE MORE

00:23:47.125 --> 00:23:48.693
DEEPLY THANK AND THAT AND

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:49.861
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IF THERE

00:23:49.928 --> 00:23:52.097
ARE ANY MORE DEEPLY WE CAN STILL

00:23:52.164 --> 00:23:52.697
DO THAT. AS THIS BILL MOVES

00:23:52.764 --> 00:23:54.599
FORWARD AND THAT WOULD. MY

00:23:54.666 --> 00:23:55.801
CONSTRUCTIVE SUGGESTION IN

00:23:55.867 --> 00:23:57.402
REGARD TO SOME OF THE ANGST

00:23:57.469 --> 00:23:59.337
ABOUT THIS CHANGE. I DID HAVE

00:23:59.404 --> 00:24:01.873
THE OPPORTUNITY TO. SEND A NOTE

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:03.208
TO ALL MY SCHOOL DISTRICTS MORE

00:24:03.275 --> 00:24:05.043
THAN A DOZEN IN MY DISTRICT ON

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:06.978
THIS BILL. AND GOT FEEDBACK FROM

00:24:07.045 --> 00:24:08.980
ABOUT TEN. THAT I'VE REVIEWED

00:24:09.047 --> 00:24:10.582
AGAIN YESTERDAY. AND FOR THE

00:24:10.649 --> 00:24:12.350
MOST PART THEY FEEL THAT THAT

00:24:12.417 --> 00:24:14.386
THIS IS GOING TO SERVE THEM

00:24:14.452 --> 00:24:15.987
WHILE. A FEW SAID THAT NOT SO

00:24:16.054 --> 00:24:17.422
SURE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GET

00:24:17.489 --> 00:24:19.691
ANY BENEFIT OUT OF IT BUT THEY

00:24:19.758 --> 00:24:20.725
DIDN'T SEE THE NEGATIVE- MOST OF

00:24:20.792 --> 00:24:22.093
THEM FELT THIS. POSITIVE STEP

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.662
FORWARD IN THAT WAS COMPELLING

00:24:23.728 --> 00:24:25.163
TESTIMONY TO MAKE. THEIR LIVES

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:25.831
FOR THE BILL TODAY WOULD BE

00:24:25.897 --> 00:24:27.499
HAPPY TO MOVE IT. THANK YOU

00:24:27.566 --> 00:24:29.201
CENTER GLAZER. GOOD ALL RIGHT

00:24:29.267 --> 00:24:31.203
THANK YOU I HAD A COUPLE

00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:32.771
COMMENTS. UP I ORIGINALLY WANTED

00:24:32.838 --> 00:24:34.472
TO DO A BILL ON ENROLLMENT BASED

00:24:34.539 --> 00:24:36.708
FUNDING. BUT AFTER WE DUG IN A

00:24:36.775 --> 00:24:39.511
LITTLE FURTHER- I DID SEE SOME

00:24:39.578 --> 00:24:40.478
ISSUES THAT I THOUGHT WERE

00:24:40.545 --> 00:24:43.315
PROBLEMATIC. AND I AM VERY MUCH

00:24:43.381 --> 00:24:45.417
IN SUPPORT. OF MORE EQUITABLE

00:24:45.483 --> 00:24:46.818
FUNDING FOR OUR SCHOOLS.

00:24:46.885 --> 00:24:48.687
PARTICULARLY WITHIN THE LOCAL

00:24:48.753 --> 00:24:50.388
CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA- I'VE

00:24:50.455 --> 00:24:51.556
NOW IS A GREAT TIME TO HAVE

00:24:51.623 --> 00:24:53.859
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE ISSUES. OF

00:24:53.925 --> 00:24:54.960
THAT WERE NOT ADDRESSED TO WIN

00:24:55.026 --> 00:24:55.994
THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING

00:24:56.061 --> 00:24:58.697
FORMULA WAS FIRST ADOPTED IN TWO

00:24:58.763 --> 00:24:59.564
THOUSAND THIRTEEN JUST BEFORE I

00:24:59.631 --> 00:25:00.832
WAS ELECTED. HOW WE COUNT

00:25:00.899 --> 00:25:02.534
STUDENTS HOW WE FUND SPECIAL

00:25:02.601 --> 00:25:04.870
EDUCATION. SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION

00:25:04.936 --> 00:25:06.905
C. T. E. AND MORE. AND THIS BILL

00:25:06.972 --> 00:25:09.541
FURTHERS THOSE DISCUSSIONS.

00:25:09.608 --> 00:25:11.209
HOWEVER AS IT RELATES TO FIVE.

00:25:11.276 --> 00:25:13.378
STUDENTS ROMAN SAID A PENDANT.

00:25:13.445 --> 00:25:15.480
BELIEVE IT. WITH CAREFUL EXAM

00:25:15.547 --> 00:25:17.949
ALL OF THIS. AND LONG TERM

00:25:18.016 --> 00:25:18.416
FISCAL. PROGRAMMATIC

00:25:18.483 --> 00:25:20.218
ADMINISTRATIVE IMPACTS. TO LOCAL

00:25:20.285 --> 00:25:22.220
EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. AND

00:25:22.287 --> 00:25:24.890
STUDENTS. SUCH AS ARE WE AWARE

00:25:24.956 --> 00:25:26.992
OF WHAT THE IMPACT OF NOBLE. AND

00:25:27.058 --> 00:25:29.394
DEVISING STUDENT ATTENDANCE. OF

00:25:29.461 --> 00:25:32.764
ALL CHIEF. WITH THIS BILL.

00:25:32.831 --> 00:25:34.466
WINNERS AND LOSERS I KNOW THE

00:25:34.532 --> 00:25:35.600
AUTHOR IT WOULD. I DON'T KNOW

00:25:35.667 --> 00:25:37.502
THAT I FEEL THAT WAY. ARE THERE

00:25:37.569 --> 00:25:38.503
ALTERNATIVES THAT INCREASED

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:39.304
EQUITY WITHOUT NEGATIVELY

00:25:39.371 --> 00:25:40.939
IMPACTING ENGAGEMENT WOULD

00:25:41.006 --> 00:25:43.008
BUILDING UPON THE EQUITY PROMISE

00:25:43.074 --> 00:25:44.776
ALREADY BUILT INTO THE L. C. F.

00:25:44.843 --> 00:25:47.212
F. B. R. HIGHER SUPPLEMENTAL AND

00:25:47.279 --> 00:25:49.114
CONCENTRATION CAMPS. ACHIEVE THE

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:51.349
SAME GOAL. THE RECENT REPORT BY

00:25:51.416 --> 00:25:52.951
THE POLICY ANALYSIS FOR

00:25:53.018 --> 00:25:54.586
CALIFORNIA EDUCATION PACE.

00:25:54.653 --> 00:25:56.688
OBSERVES THAT CHANGING THE LCF

00:25:56.755 --> 00:25:58.456
STUDENT COUNT METHODOLOGY

00:25:58.523 --> 00:26:00.625
CREATES TRADE OFFS AND SHOULD BE

00:26:00.692 --> 00:26:02.193
ANALYZED AND OTHER ALTERNATIVES

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:04.095
FOR INCREASING FUNDING EQUITY.

00:26:04.162 --> 00:26:05.463
SOMETHING THAT WE ALSO DON'T

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:07.432
THINK ABOUT IS IF WE GO TO

00:26:07.499 --> 00:26:08.566
ENROLLMENT BASED FUNDING AND

00:26:08.633 --> 00:26:10.502
ROMANS ARE DECREASING SO MY

00:26:10.568 --> 00:26:12.671
WORRY ALSO IS THAT THIS IS A

00:26:12.737 --> 00:26:14.506
SHORT TERM FIX. THE REPORT ALSO

00:26:14.572 --> 00:26:16.408
CONCLUDES THAT CHANGING THE LCF

00:26:16.474 --> 00:26:18.276
STUDENT COUNT METHODOLOGY WOULD

00:26:18.343 --> 00:26:19.978
REQUIRE. THE STATE TO FIND OTHER

00:26:20.045 --> 00:26:22.847
WAYS TO DRIVE POSITIVE PRACTICE.

00:26:22.914 --> 00:26:24.082
PRACTICES RELATED TO STUDENT

00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:26.184
ATTENDANCE AND ENGAGEMENT. I DO

00:26:26.251 --> 00:26:27.552
NOT SEE A MEANINGFUL ATTEMPT TO

00:26:27.619 --> 00:26:29.054
DRIVE THOSE PRACTICES IN THIS

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:31.089
BILL. I ALSO DO NOT SEE HOW THIS

00:26:31.156 --> 00:26:32.824
BILL FITS WITHIN THE BROADER

00:26:32.891 --> 00:26:34.192
EDUCATION FUNDING LANDSCAPE.

00:26:34.259 --> 00:26:36.061
GIVEN THAT ATTENDANCE WAS STILL

00:26:36.127 --> 00:26:37.929
BE USED TO CALCULATE PROPOSITION

00:26:37.996 --> 00:26:39.764
NINETY EIGHT. SPECIAL EDUCATION

00:26:39.831 --> 00:26:40.865
FUNDING LOTTERY ALL ACTIONS AND

00:26:40.932 --> 00:26:43.435
MORE. FOR ALL THESE REASONS THE

00:26:43.501 --> 00:26:44.269
COMMITTEE REMEMBRANCE WHAT

00:26:44.336 --> 00:26:46.638
ESTABLISH. A PRE IMPLEMENTATION

00:26:46.705 --> 00:26:49.507
STUDY TO JANUARY ONE TWENTY

00:26:49.574 --> 00:26:51.476
TWENTY FOUR SO WE CAN CONTINUE

00:26:51.543 --> 00:26:52.477
WITH THESE DISCUSSIONS. AND MAKE

00:26:52.544 --> 00:26:54.346
A MORE INFORMED DECISION. WILL

00:26:54.412 --> 00:26:57.048
BE VOTING NO ON THE BILL. THE

00:26:57.115 --> 00:26:59.117
BILL HAS HOWEVER BEEN MOVED

00:26:59.184 --> 00:27:00.352
CENTER PORTANTINO. WOULD YOU

00:27:00.418 --> 00:27:02.187
LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU ARE

00:27:02.253 --> 00:27:03.888
MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS AND THANK

00:27:03.955 --> 00:27:07.425
YOU FOR ALL THOSE FOLKS WHO

00:27:07.492 --> 00:27:11.029
SPOKE. FOR THE BILL. OF CERTAIN

00:27:11.096 --> 00:27:12.230
. COMMENTS FROM MY- I APPRECIATE

00:27:12.297 --> 00:27:13.932
- THE DEEP CUTS. ABOUT THIS

00:27:13.999 --> 00:27:16.601
CHANGE IS HARD. WHENEVER YOU

00:27:16.668 --> 00:27:18.837
LOOK AND CONTEMPLATE MAKING A

00:27:18.903 --> 00:27:20.138
CHANGE AND IN THIS CASE

00:27:20.205 --> 00:27:21.339
SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING

00:27:21.406 --> 00:27:23.041
FOR FIVE DECADES- IT'S A

00:27:23.108 --> 00:27:25.076
DIFFICULT CONVERSATION- THIS IS

00:27:25.143 --> 00:27:26.311
NOT A NEW CONVERSATION THOUGH-

00:27:26.378 --> 00:27:28.079
MY DISTRICT IN PARTICULAR

00:27:28.146 --> 00:27:30.048
PASADENA UNIFIED. HAS BEEN ME

00:27:30.115 --> 00:27:32.417
ASKING ME TO LOOK AT THIS CHANGE

00:27:32.484 --> 00:27:34.819
FOR A DECADE- AND WHEN YOU HAVE

00:27:34.886 --> 00:27:37.088
A SURPLUS TO THE SIZE OF THE

00:27:37.155 --> 00:27:38.990
STATE IS. A GRAPPLING WITH THIS

00:27:39.057 --> 00:27:41.526
YEAR I BELIEVE OUR STUDENTS OUR

00:27:41.593 --> 00:27:43.695
CHILDREN SHOULD SHARE IN THAT

00:27:43.762 --> 00:27:44.763
BENEFIT THAT SHOULD BE A TOP

00:27:44.829 --> 00:27:48.133
PRIORITY AND- ARE ANALYSIS SHOWS

00:27:48.199 --> 00:27:50.568
THAT- THREE AND A HALF BILLION

00:27:50.635 --> 00:27:52.170
DOLLARS OF EXTRA FUNDING OR

00:27:52.237 --> 00:27:53.671
ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO K. TWELVE

00:27:53.738 --> 00:27:55.106
EDUCATION WILL RESULT FROM THIS

00:27:55.173 --> 00:27:57.175
BILL- AND EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT.

00:27:57.242 --> 00:27:59.978
WOULD SEE A BENEFIT- AND SO THIS

00:28:00.045 --> 00:28:01.746
IS THE TIME TO MAKE THAT

00:28:01.813 --> 00:28:03.481
STRUCTURAL CHANGE I THINK. MY

00:28:03.548 --> 00:28:04.249
COLLEAGUE FROM NORTHERN

00:28:04.315 --> 00:28:06.418
CALIFORNIA'S COMMENTS OF HIS

00:28:06.484 --> 00:28:08.353
FRUSTRATION THROUGHOUT THE YEARS

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:09.921
YOU KNOW GRAPPLING WITH. TRYING

00:28:09.988 --> 00:28:10.922
TO GET ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR

00:28:10.989 --> 00:28:12.757
EDUCATION BRINGING PEOPLE HERE

00:28:12.824 --> 00:28:14.359
HIGHLIGHTING THE NEED THIS IS

00:28:14.426 --> 00:28:16.327
THE TIME TO MAKE THAT TO MAKE

00:28:16.394 --> 00:28:17.996
THAT TRUCKS WILL CHANGE. THE

00:28:18.063 --> 00:28:19.731
SHIFT TO A MORE EQUITABLE WAY OF

00:28:19.798 --> 00:28:22.333
FUNDING EDUCATION WE KNOW THIS

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.502
IS WORKING ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

00:28:24.569 --> 00:28:26.071
WE KNOW THAT MOST PROGRESSIVE

00:28:26.137 --> 00:28:28.406
STATE OF FUND EDUCATION BASED ON

00:28:28.473 --> 00:28:30.442
ENROLLMENT WE KNOW THAT IT DOES

00:28:30.508 --> 00:28:31.409
NOT NEGATIVELY IMPACT

00:28:31.476 --> 00:28:34.646
ATTENDANCE- WE HAVE. WE HAVE ALL

00:28:34.712 --> 00:28:36.047
OF THE PILOT PROGRAMS WE NEED

00:28:36.114 --> 00:28:37.615
BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL OF THOSE

00:28:37.682 --> 00:28:38.983
STATES THAT ARE DOING THIS

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:40.518
EFFECTIVELY AND SELF. MY CLOSES

00:28:40.585 --> 00:28:42.587
THIS TIME TO EMBRACE CHANGE

00:28:42.654 --> 00:28:44.189
OBVIOUS I'LL CONTINUE TO WORK

00:28:44.255 --> 00:28:45.390
WITH THOSE WHO HAVE EXPRESSED

00:28:45.457 --> 00:28:48.026
CONCERNS- MAKING SURE THAT THEY

00:28:48.093 --> 00:28:48.626
UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE TALKING

00:28:48.693 --> 00:28:50.328
ABOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDING NOT.

00:28:50.395 --> 00:28:52.130
JUST REALLOCATING PROP NINETY

00:28:52.197 --> 00:28:53.731
EIGHT BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS AN

00:28:53.798 --> 00:28:55.266
IMPORTANT POINT TO KEEP MAKING

00:28:55.333 --> 00:28:57.102
SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK

REMAINS VERY BROAD GOING FAR

00:38:21.632 --> 00:38:23.300
BEYOND BEHAVIORS THAT INDICATE

REASONS. A LOT OF GOOD CAN COME

OUT OF THAT WORK THAT YOU'RE

01:04:23.059 --> 01:04:25.061
PROPOSING TO DO IN THE BILL-

01:04:25.127 --> 01:04:26.729
THE- SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT

01:04:26.796 --> 01:04:28.464
I AM. STRUGGLING WITH IN REGARD

01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:29.799
TO THE BILL IS THE NARROWNESS OF

01:04:29.865 --> 01:04:34.003
IT- JUST FOCUSING ON THAT. SPACE

01:04:34.070 --> 01:04:35.471
THERE'S LANGUAGE IN THE BILL

01:04:35.538 --> 01:04:37.840
THAT AT THAT TO EXCLUDE TO KIND

01:04:37.907 --> 01:04:40.276
OF REVIEW AND RESEARCH. ON

01:04:40.343 --> 01:04:42.478
FOSSIL FUELS. AND HOW THAT COULD

01:04:42.545 --> 01:04:45.381
BE PART OF THE SOLUTION- THERE'S

01:04:45.448 --> 01:04:47.783
A RECOGNITION. OF THE AT LEAST

01:04:47.850 --> 01:04:49.719
IN THE ANALYSIS OF THE

01:04:49.785 --> 01:04:50.586
PREVENTING PROBLEMS THAT- THAT

01:04:50.653 --> 01:04:54.457
WE SEE. IN THE ANY KIND OF

01:04:54.523 --> 01:04:55.458
APPLICATION. WITH DELAYS OF

01:04:55.524 --> 01:04:58.227
FIVE. TO BE ABLE TO. TRY TO TAKE

01:04:58.294 --> 01:05:00.563
ADVANTAGE OF CARBON CAPTURE AND

01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:05.334
THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT THAT HAS-

01:05:05.401 --> 01:05:08.037
I HAVE TO SAY THAT WHEN I LOOK

01:05:08.104 --> 01:05:08.704
AT. THE CRITERIA THAT HAVE BEEN

01:05:08.771 --> 01:05:10.673
SET UP IN THE BILL. IT IT

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:14.510
REMINDS ME OF OUR HOUSING CRISIS

01:05:14.577 --> 01:05:16.078
. WHY IS WHY IS THAT BECAUSE WE

01:05:16.145 --> 01:05:17.880
SAY WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS IN

01:05:17.947 --> 01:05:19.882
THE STATE AND THEN WE CREATE ALL

01:05:19.949 --> 01:05:21.884
THESE CRITERIA AND ALL THESE

01:05:21.951 --> 01:05:23.853
GOOD VALUES THAT WE HAVE. THAT

01:05:23.919 --> 01:05:25.788
HAVE TO BE IN PLACE FOR US TO

01:05:25.855 --> 01:05:27.390
SOLVE THE HOUSING CRISIS AND

01:05:27.456 --> 01:05:29.358
THEN AT THE END OF THE DAY GOOD

01:05:29.425 --> 01:05:31.627
PLUS GOOD PLUS GOOD EQUALS BAD

01:05:31.694 --> 01:05:32.762
WE DIDN'T REALLY GET THE

01:05:32.828 --> 01:05:34.497
PROBLEM. AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT

01:05:34.563 --> 01:05:36.599
THIS ISSUE OF CARBON CAPTURE AND

01:05:36.666 --> 01:05:37.967
THE POTENTIAL THE POTENTIAL THAT

01:05:38.034 --> 01:05:40.503
IT AS I SEE THE START OF THAT IN

01:05:40.569 --> 01:05:43.406
IN THIS BILL. THERE'S PARK

01:05:43.472 --> 01:05:45.541
MENSEN PRIORITIES THAT ARE SET

01:05:45.608 --> 01:05:48.411
THAT HAVE GOOD VALUES AND

01:05:48.477 --> 01:05:51.981
REASONS FOR THEM BUT THE END OF

01:05:52.048 --> 01:05:53.949
THE DAY ARE THE GONNA LET US

01:05:54.016 --> 01:05:58.154
THIS PROBLEM. THE SOLVE. AND THE

01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:01.824
WAY IN BECAUSE WE KEEP PILING ON

01:06:01.891 --> 01:06:04.226
A THE GOOD THAT WE WANT SEE AND

01:06:04.293 --> 01:06:05.828
HOW IT'S DONE IN THEN WE DON'T

01:06:05.895 --> 01:06:07.463
REALLY SUB. AND SO THOSE ARE THE

01:06:07.530 --> 01:06:09.165
CHALLENGES THAT ARE BEING WITH

01:06:09.231 --> 01:06:11.334
THE BILL THAT I KNOW COMES A

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:12.501
GOOD PLACE THE NARROWNESS OF IT

01:06:12.568 --> 01:06:15.171
AND- HIS IS. PART OF IT THAT.

01:06:15.237 --> 01:06:16.939

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:47.336
AUTHORIZE ANY PILOTS. AND THERE

01:06:47.403 --> 01:06:49.472
IS. FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES

01:06:49.538 --> 01:06:51.741
THERE'S NOT REALLY ANY VIABLE

01:06:51.807 --> 01:06:52.441
COMMERCIAL CARBON CAPTURE IN

01:06:52.508 --> 01:06:55.511
CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW. FIND ONLY

01:06:55.578 --> 01:06:58.080
WORLDWIDE IN A FEW PLACES. SO

01:06:58.147 --> 01:07:01.817
PERSONALLY I AM VERY SUPPORTIVE

01:07:01.884 --> 01:07:02.985
OF CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE I

01:07:03.052 --> 01:07:05.054
WANT TO SEE IT. BUT I ALSO KNOW

01:07:05.121 --> 01:07:07.289
THAT THERE'S LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE

01:07:07.356 --> 01:07:08.424
CONCERNED ABOUT IT THERE WE TAKE

01:07:08.491 --> 01:07:10.860
THE GEO SEQUESTRATION WE KNOW

01:07:10.926 --> 01:07:13.562
FOR EXAMPLE ONLY SO CANYON WAS

01:07:13.629 --> 01:07:18.000
IN EFFECT- A- GEOLOGIC CAP-

01:07:18.067 --> 01:07:21.070
PLEASE HOLD. BUT CERTAIN GASES

01:07:21.137 --> 01:07:23.105
RATE IN THE ESCAPED AND IT

01:07:23.172 --> 01:07:25.040
CAUSED PROBLEMS NOW CARBON

01:07:25.107 --> 01:07:27.376
ESCAPING WOULD NOT BECAUSE THAT

01:07:27.443 --> 01:07:29.879
TYPE OF- PERCEIVE NEW AIR

01:07:29.945 --> 01:07:32.114
POLLUTION BECAUSE CARBON ME YES

01:07:32.181 --> 01:07:32.915
IT'S BAD FOR THE CLIMATE BUT

01:07:32.982 --> 01:07:36.485
IT'S NOT TOXIC PER SE BUT THE-

01:07:36.552 --> 01:07:38.587
BEING IS THAT. WE BOTH DO NOT

01:07:38.654 --> 01:07:40.356
HAVE THE GROUP WILL. YOU KNOW

01:07:40.423 --> 01:07:41.724
PUT IT'S NOT ALREADY

01:07:41.791 --> 01:07:43.225
COMMERCIALLY VIABLE WE HAVEN'T

01:07:43.292 --> 01:07:46.996
HAD. SO THE PURPOSE OF MY BILL

01:07:47.062 --> 01:07:48.798
IS TO GET US TO START THAT. IN

01:07:48.864 --> 01:07:51.801
ITS NARROW. TO YOU KNOW HAVE

01:07:51.867 --> 01:07:53.369
HOPEFULLY A SUCCESSFUL

01:07:53.436 --> 01:07:55.838
EXPERIENCE THAT WE CAN THEN

01:07:55.905 --> 01:07:58.474
BUILD ON. WHILE THE TECHNOLOGIES

01:07:58.541 --> 01:07:59.942
ARE DEVELOPING WORLD MARKETS

01:08:00.009 --> 01:08:03.045
DEVELOPING BEYOND WHILE

01:08:03.112 --> 01:08:05.681
CONFIRMING THAT SENATOR COPIERS

01:08:05.748 --> 01:08:07.650

01:08:07.716 --> 01:08:10.519
ALSO DEVELOPS RULES OR- OR

01:08:10.586 --> 01:08:15.224
PRIORITIES FOR MUCH LARGER. SO I

01:08:15.291 --> 01:08:18.394
UNDERSTAND THE- OPPOSITION WOULD

01:08:18.461 --> 01:08:20.830
LIKE MY BILL DO EVERYTHING BUT A

01:08:20.896 --> 01:08:22.798
SINGLE BILL CAN'T DO EVERYTHING

01:08:22.865 --> 01:08:25.234
AND IT IS GETTING US AT LEAST

01:08:25.301 --> 01:08:26.235
GETTING CALIFORNIA THE

01:08:26.302 --> 01:08:28.871
EXPERIENCE OF CAPTURING SOME

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:30.873
CARBON AND STORING IT WHICH WE

01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:33.876
DON'T HAVE YET SO THAT POINT OF

01:08:33.943 --> 01:08:35.911
VIEW I THINK IT'S A IT'S A GOOD

01:08:35.978 --> 01:08:37.746
MOVE FORWARD IMPORTANT MOVE

01:08:37.813 --> 01:08:41.150
FORWARD. AND IT ALLOWS US THEN

01:08:41.217 --> 01:08:45.287
TO HELP US WAY SOME OF THE FEARS

01:08:45.354 --> 01:08:48.357
ABOUT THIS TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE

01:08:48.424 --> 01:08:50.092
I'M OPTIMISTIC WILL PROVE THAT

01:08:50.159 --> 01:08:52.461
IT WORKED IT DIDN'T HURT THAT WE

01:08:52.528 --> 01:08:55.264
WERE ABLE TO STORAGE

01:08:55.331 --> 01:08:56.866
GEOLOGICALLY. GO AHEAD CENTER

01:08:56.932 --> 01:08:59.001
GLAZER WHAT THANK YOU THANK YOU

FOR THAT EXPLANATION AND I DID

01:09:00.703 --> 01:09:02.905
WATCH THE HEARING THIS MORNING.

DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW WE- COM.

01:09:12.615 --> 01:09:16.318
BROADER AND FACE- AND I THINK

01:09:16.385 --> 01:09:18.687
THAT HELPS ME TODAY BECAUSE IT

01:09:18.754 --> 01:09:21.657
THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM WHO

01:09:21.724 --> 01:09:23.125
IS HERE IN ISOLATION I WOULDN'T

BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT GOING

01:09:24.527 --> 01:09:26.295

BELIEVE ME YOU KNOW THEY OF.

01:33:54.795 --> 01:33:57.732
BECAUSE THEY A FULL I'M CLASSIC

01:33:57.798 --> 01:33:59.834

. THAT'S NOT ARE ALL ABOUT-

01:34:09.877 --> 01:34:12.747
SOUL. WE AGREED TO THESE

01:34:12.813 --> 01:34:15.583
AMENDMENTS THAT REALLY NARROWED

01:34:15.649 --> 01:34:18.452
IT DOWN TO JUST A FEW OF THE

01:34:18.519 --> 01:34:21.088

JUST LIFE SO I BELIEVE THAT WITH

01:34:48.315 --> 01:34:51.085
THIS WE'VE CAPTURED BASED ON THE

01:34:51.152 --> 01:34:54.121

THEY HAVE TO BE DEPENDENT- HAVE

01:34:57.691 --> 01:34:59.860
DEPENDENT VISAS THAT. IT'S A

01:34:59.927 --> 01:35:01.695
REASONABLE IT'S A GOOD THING TO

01:35:01.762 --> 01:35:03.964
DO AND IT'S NOT OPENING IT UP TO

01:35:04.031 --> 01:35:06.333

IMPLEMENT SOMETHING OF THIS SORT

01:58:17.123 --> 01:58:21.794
HEARING IN CALIFORNIA. MANAGER

01:58:21.861 --> 01:58:22.895
WOULD YOU PER WHAT WOULD YOU

01:58:22.962 --> 01:58:25.331
ALLOW. ME TO ENTER THIS WINTER

01:58:25.398 --> 01:58:28.701
OKAY SO THE- THE SH THE SHOP. IN

01:58:28.768 --> 01:58:30.703
REGARDS TO THE SHOP LOCAL FOR

01:58:30.770 --> 01:58:33.406
THE PURCHASE BY AMERICAN OR OR

01:58:33.473 --> 01:58:34.941
BY BY CALIFORNIAN IT'S A BUY

01:58:35.007 --> 01:58:37.443
AMERICAN SO IT'S ANY ANYWHERE IN

01:58:37.510 --> 01:58:38.845
THE UNITED STATES. BUT OBVIOUSLY

01:58:38.911 --> 01:58:40.413
WE PAY SO MUCH OF IT THAT IT

01:58:40.480 --> 01:58:41.981
WOULD HELP OUR FARMERS NO

01:58:42.048 --> 01:58:44.350
QUESTION ABOUT IT IS- IT WOULD

01:58:44.417 --> 01:58:46.018
NOT AFFECT ANY OF OUR TRADE

01:58:46.085 --> 01:58:47.753
AGREEMENTS AND WE HAVE A TRADE

01:58:47.820 --> 01:58:50.189
AGREEMENTS WITH. ALL OF THE-

01:58:50.256 --> 01:58:51.657
FACT IT OR TRADE AGREE AND

01:58:51.724 --> 01:58:53.826
THAT'S REALLY THE LEGAL- ISSUE

01:58:53.893 --> 01:58:56.596
THAT- THAT- YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:58:56.662 --> 01:58:59.632
WHICH IS. WHICH IS ON. IT'S

01:58:59.699 --> 01:59:01.133
IMPORTANT BUT IT DOESN'T AFFECT

01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:03.169
THAT THE 25% BASICALLY WAS

01:59:03.236 --> 01:59:06.772
ARRIVED AT BY- BY A- TAKING A

01:59:06.839 --> 01:59:08.140
LOOK AT WHAT ARE THE

01:59:08.207 --> 01:59:09.408
REQUIREMENTS THAT WE PUT ON OUR

01:59:09.475 --> 01:59:11.544
FARMERS- THE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:59:11.611 --> 01:59:13.946
REQUIREMENTS THE- LABOR

01:59:14.013 --> 01:59:17.483
REQUIREMENTS THE- SAFETY

01:59:17.550 --> 01:59:19.886
STANDARDS THAT BET THE REQUIRED

01:59:19.952 --> 01:59:21.888
THE RIDICULOUS TORY FRAMEWORK.

01:59:21.954 --> 01:59:24.924
AND THAT NUMBER WAS- WAS A

01:59:24.991 --> 01:59:27.226
NUMBER THAT WE DECIDED WAS

01:59:27.293 --> 01:59:30.897
SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH SO THAT YOU.

01:59:30.963 --> 01:59:36.168
ARE ARE- LOCAL. AG COMPANIES

01:59:36.235 --> 01:59:37.937
COULD COMPETE ON THE WORLD

01:59:38.004 --> 01:59:40.540
MARKET- AGAINST OTHER COUNTRIES

01:59:40.606 --> 01:59:42.141
THAT DON'T HAVE ANY OF THE

01:59:42.208 --> 01:59:44.310
PROTECTIONS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS

01:59:44.377 --> 01:59:46.479
THE REASON THAT THEY'RE SO.

01:59:46.546 --> 01:59:48.548
INEXPENSIVE TO BUY IS THAT THE

01:59:48.614 --> 01:59:51.417
QUALITY IS NOT S HIGH- AND

01:59:51.484 --> 01:59:53.486
THAT'S- THAT'S JUST THE FACT OF

01:59:53.553 --> 01:59:55.421
THE MATTER IS THAT WE HAVE THE

01:59:55.488 --> 01:59:58.424
HIGHEST QUALITY PRODUCE- FRUITS

01:59:58.491 --> 02:00:01.360
AND NUTS INCLUDED OF ANYWHERE IN

02:00:01.427 --> 02:00:03.329
THE WORLD BUT THERE'S A COST

02:00:03.396 --> 02:00:04.997
THAT COMES WITH IN THEIR ALSO A

02:00:05.064 --> 02:00:07.567
FOOD. AT THE HIT THE- BECAUSE

02:00:07.633 --> 02:00:09.769
JUST DOESN'T MEET THE QUALITY

02:00:09.835 --> 02:00:12.738
THAT WE EXPECT IN ORDER FOR IT

02:00:12.805 --> 02:00:14.774
TO GET TO THE MARK- AND SO.

02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:16.108
THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT WE FIVE

02:00:16.175 --> 02:00:18.678
CAME 25% CAME FROM IS THAT- IT

02:00:18.744 --> 02:00:21.747
IT IT PUT SET UP. IT IT PUT THAT

02:00:21.814 --> 02:00:22.949
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BY

02:00:23.015 --> 02:00:24.350
AMERICAN PRIDE OF PRODUCTS

02:00:24.417 --> 02:00:26.118
DOESN'T HAVE ANY NUMBER AT ALL

02:00:26.185 --> 02:00:29.155
THEY JUST BASICALLY SAY-

02:00:29.221 --> 02:00:31.724
REASONABLE- AND WE- PICKED UP A

02:00:31.791 --> 02:00:33.659
NUMBER SO THAT WAY WE COULD.

02:00:33.726 --> 02:00:38.064
MORE ACCURATELY ON TO- THAT WHAT

02:00:38.130 --> 02:00:39.498
IT IS THAT ON THE DATE BUT

02:00:39.565 --> 02:00:42.134
PRODUCT MIGHT. THAT NUMBER THAT

02:00:42.201 --> 02:00:43.869
THAT WE WANT PEOPLE DO IT AT

02:00:43.936 --> 02:00:46.305
THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ACHIEVE

02:00:46.372 --> 02:00:47.540
IS THAT WE WANT THEM TO BUY

02:00:47.607 --> 02:00:51.010
LOCALLY OR NATIONALLY PRODUCED

02:00:51.077 --> 02:00:54.347
FRUITS VEGETABLES AND NUTS- AS

02:00:54.413 --> 02:00:56.682
LONG AS THE MARGIN IS NOT MORE

02:00:56.749 --> 02:01:00.720
THAN 25% LESS- THE MARCH. TWENTY

02:01:00.786 --> 02:01:02.622
MORE. FULLER QUESTION TO THE

KEITH IS RALPH. IN AND ONE OF

02:01:26.846 --> 02:01:28.314
THE COMMENTS THAT STRUCK ME ON

02:01:28.381 --> 02:01:30.650
HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL WAS

02:01:30.716 --> 02:01:33.486
THAT- WE WEREN'T TAPPING ALL OF

02:01:33.552 --> 02:01:37.590
THE FEDERAL FUNDS- THAT WERE AB

02:01:37.657 --> 02:01:41.527
THAT CALIFORNIA WAS ENTITLED TO-

02:01:41.594 --> 02:01:44.163
WHEN HE CAME TO THE MEAL. WE

02:01:44.230 --> 02:01:46.432
JUST HAVE. THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS

02:01:46.499 --> 02:01:49.001
. USING IT UP FOR OR UTILIZING

02:01:49.068 --> 02:01:51.203
AND THAT'S WHY SHE'S SORT OF A

02:01:51.270 --> 02:01:52.938
MADE THAT POINT WITH IN SUPPORT

02:01:53.005 --> 02:01:54.573
OF HER BILL I END UP SUPPORTING

02:01:54.640 --> 02:01:55.775
THE BILL BECAUSE I THOUGHT WELL

02:01:55.841 --> 02:01:58.344
IF WE ARE NOT TALKING A LITTLE

02:01:58.411 --> 02:01:59.245
SPECIAL FUNDS THEN PERHAPS WE

02:01:59.311 --> 02:02:01.881

WE CAN GET THOSE HANDS WITH THIS

02:02:05.718 --> 02:02:09.655
WITH THIS SPELL. IF WE WERE TO

02:02:09.722 --> 02:02:11.691
NOT SURE WHERE THAT BELLE IS IF

02:02:11.757 --> 02:02:13.359

BUDGET. SENATOR HOWEVER THE-

02:02:29.475 --> 02:02:30.743
THERE THERE ARE A COUPLE OF

02:02:30.810 --> 02:02:32.878
THINGS ONE IS THAT WE GET MONEY

02:02:32.945 --> 02:02:33.879
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE

02:02:33.946 --> 02:02:35.948
ALSO GET FOOD SUBSIDIES FROM THE

02:02:36.015 --> 02:02:37.750
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND THEN.

02:02:37.817 --> 02:02:39.652
ALSO TRIBUTE TO ITIN TERMS OF

02:02:39.719 --> 02:02:41.220
THE FOOD PROGRAM THE FEDERAL

02:02:41.287 --> 02:02:43.823
GOVERNMENT HAS A U. S. D. A.

02:02:43.889 --> 02:02:45.991
PURCHASING AGREEMENT AS WELL AND

02:02:46.058 --> 02:02:48.861
THEY SEND A FOOD TO THE SCHOOL

02:02:48.928 --> 02:02:51.697
DISTRICTS AS I UNDERSTAND- AT

02:02:51.764 --> 02:02:54.100
AND SO WE'VE EXCLUDED THAT FROM

02:02:54.166 --> 02:02:56.368
THIS DISCUSSION BECAUSE WE DON'T

02:02:56.435 --> 02:02:57.870
WANT SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO

02:02:57.937 --> 02:02:58.871
RESPONSIBLE FOR SOMETHING THE

02:02:58.938 --> 02:03:02.608
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS TAKING

02:03:02.675 --> 02:03:04.076
CARE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

02:03:04.143 --> 02:03:06.746
DOESN'T DESERVE YOU. THEY'RE NOT

02:03:06.812 --> 02:03:07.880
WE DIDN'T FEEL IT WAS

02:03:07.947 --> 02:03:08.981
APPROPRIATE FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS

02:03:09.048 --> 02:03:13.085
TO WORRY ABOUT THAT- SO- THIS

02:03:13.152 --> 02:03:15.421
THIS PROGRAM WOULD BE PAID FOR

02:03:15.488 --> 02:03:17.490
WITH FEDERAL FUNDS AS WELL AS

02:03:17.556 --> 02:03:18.591
STATE FUNDS THAT'S WHERE THEY

02:03:18.657 --> 02:03:20.459
GET THEIR MONEY FOR THE FOOD.

THAT DO NOT GENERATE ANY REVENUE

02:25:52.210 --> 02:25:53.778
THIS BILL WOULD DIVERT CRITICAL

02:25:53.845 --> 02:25:56.314
RESOURCES FOR ALL STUDENTS TO

IT'S ABOVE AND BEYOND THOSE.

02:26:17.802 --> 02:26:19.670
COSTS THAT WOULD GO INTO THE

02:26:19.737 --> 02:26:21.672
FUNDS SO IF YOUR SOCCER TEAM IS

02:26:21.739 --> 02:26:23.040
GETTING A HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:26:23.107 --> 02:26:23.841

02:26:23.908 --> 02:26:25.543
CONTINUE TO GET A HUNDRED

02:26:25.610 --> 02:26:26.777

HONESTLY I'VE HAD A LOT OF

02:26:42.660 --> 02:26:44.028
TROUBLE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

02:26:44.095 --> 02:26:45.897
EXACTLY HOW THIS BILL IS GOING

02:26:45.963 --> 02:26:46.497

02:26:54.539 --> 02:26:56.574
BILL APPLIES TO BOTH PRIVATE AND

02:26:56.641 --> 02:26:57.642
PUBLIC CULTURES RIGHT IN

02:26:57.708 --> 02:26:59.510
CALIFORNIA. OKAY BECAUSE- YOU

02:26:59.577 --> 02:27:01.746
KNOW I KNOW OF FOR EXAMPLE THE

02:27:01.812 --> 02:27:02.647
STATE UNIVERSITIES HAVE A LOT OF

02:27:02.713 --> 02:27:04.815
FAMILIARITY WITH THE STATE

02:27:04.882 --> 02:27:05.416
UNIVERSITY- SO MAYBE WE CAN

02:27:05.483 --> 02:27:06.851
START IN THAT SPACE BECAUSE I

02:27:06.918 --> 02:27:08.686
CERTAINLY THINK. EFFORTS TO GO

02:27:08.753 --> 02:27:11.722
AFTER HE LEADS. EXCEPTIONAL

02:27:11.789 --> 02:27:13.758
INSTITUTIONS THAT EXPLOIT.

02:27:13.824 --> 02:27:15.326
THAT'S LIKE OVER HERE. BUT THE

02:27:15.393 --> 02:27:16.727
BROAD SWATH OF WHERE THIS BILL

02:27:16.794 --> 02:27:18.729
APPLIES WHAT I'M REALLY TRYING

02:27:18.796 --> 02:27:20.464
TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER. THAT THAT

02:27:20.531 --> 02:27:22.567
IT SHOULD BE APPLICABLE IN THAT

02:27:22.633 --> 02:27:23.501
SPACE SO- WE HAVE TWENTY THREE

02:27:23.568 --> 02:27:27.138
CSU CAMPUSES. I CAME FROM SAN

02:27:27.205 --> 02:27:29.340
DIEGO STATE AS YOU. BELIEVES THE

02:27:29.407 --> 02:27:31.375
- THEY IT'S THAT LED TO IN A

02:27:31.442 --> 02:27:33.344
POSITIVE WAY- ONE OF THE

02:27:33.411 --> 02:27:35.580
OUTSTANDING MOST OUTSTANDING OF

02:27:35.646 --> 02:27:39.584
THE STATE UNIVERSITIES- AND I

02:27:39.650 --> 02:27:41.385
DID HAVE TO USE IN EUROPE ONE OF

02:27:41.452 --> 02:27:42.386
THE LEAGUE'S. I DID HAVE

02:27:42.453 --> 02:27:43.421
FAMILIARITY WITH THEIR ATHLETIC

02:27:43.487 --> 02:27:44.789
BUDGET BECAUSE IT WAS VERY

02:27:44.855 --> 02:27:46.691
INVOLVED IN THE FUNDING OF TITLE

02:27:46.757 --> 02:27:47.592
NINE AND- WOMEN'S ATHLETICS WHEN

02:27:47.658 --> 02:27:49.594
I WAS ON THE CAMPUS. AND AT THAT

02:27:49.660 --> 02:27:51.362
POINT IN TIME AND I DON'T KNOW

02:27:51.429 --> 02:27:53.331
IF IT HAS CHANGED- BUT BUT-

02:27:53.397 --> 02:27:54.498
THERE WERE ONLY TWO SPORTS THE

02:27:54.565 --> 02:27:56.434
GENERATED ANY REVENUE. THAT WAS

02:27:56.500 --> 02:27:58.269
FOOTBALL AND MEN'S BASKETBALL.

02:27:58.336 --> 02:27:59.570
AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS

02:27:59.637 --> 02:28:01.706
CHANGED SINCE OUR YEARS. HAVE

02:28:01.772 --> 02:28:03.274
GONE BY AND I DON'T IMAGINE

02:28:03.341 --> 02:28:04.609
THERE ANY DIFFERENT THAN ANY OF

02:28:04.675 --> 02:28:06.277
THE STATE UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES.

02:28:06.344 --> 02:28:08.312
SO IF PART OF THE CRITERIA IS

02:28:08.379 --> 02:28:10.581
THAT YOU'RE ELIGIBLE. THAT IS

02:28:10.648 --> 02:28:12.516
THAT YOU GET YOU HAVE A SPORT

02:28:12.583 --> 02:28:14.285
THAT GENERATES REVENUE WILL MOST

02:28:14.352 --> 02:28:15.820
SPORTS. DON'T GENERATE ANY

02:28:15.886 --> 02:28:20.291
REVENUE- AND SO WE REALLY JUST

02:28:20.358 --> 02:28:21.859
TALKING ABOUT THE EXPLOITATION

02:28:21.926 --> 02:28:24.462
AND COMPENSATION OF BASKETBALL

02:28:24.528 --> 02:28:26.364

02:28:27.732 --> 02:28:31.035
IS APPLIED IT SEEMS LIKE THAT'S

02:28:31.102 --> 02:28:32.336
WHAT THAT'S THE HEART OF IT IS

02:28:32.403 --> 02:28:35.072
THE IS THAT THAT SPACE MIGHT

02:28:35.139 --> 02:28:36.140
NOT. THEY ARE THE LARGEST

02:28:36.207 --> 02:28:37.608
GENERATOR BUT THIS IS TO BE

02:28:37.675 --> 02:28:39.577
APPLIED UPLIFT POLITICALLY

02:28:39.644 --> 02:28:42.313
ACROSS THE BOARD TO ALL SPORTS

02:28:42.380 --> 02:28:43.614

TO PAY SOMEBODY IF THE REVENUE

02:28:56.260 --> 02:28:58.329

02:29:18.949 --> 02:29:20.685
WHO CAN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT

02:29:20.751 --> 02:29:22.586
AND IT BEATS THE SYSTEM THAT OUT

02:29:22.653 --> 02:29:27.024
RIGHT NOW I CAN'T EVEN AND- IF

02:29:27.091 --> 02:29:28.559
YOU- COLLEGES. YOU HAVE. COACHES

02:29:28.626 --> 02:29:31.162
MAKING. WERE SIX FIGURES ME- OF

02:29:31.228 --> 02:29:34.265
pATHLETIC DIRECTORS WHO WERE

02:29:34.332 --> 02:29:35.633
MAKING HALF A MILLION DOLLARS

02:29:35.700 --> 02:29:37.768
PLUS SO- THERE'S REVENUE FOR

02:29:37.835 --> 02:29:39.837
THEM SO WE'RE JUST SAYING. RIGHT

02:29:39.904 --> 02:29:41.405
AND I KNOW WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE

02:29:41.472 --> 02:29:43.341
AND I THINK THAT IS AN

02:29:43.407 --> 02:29:45.276
INTERESTING. CONVERSATION ABOUT-

02:29:45.343 --> 02:29:46.544
COLLEGE SPORTS CENTER CAMPUSES

02:29:46.610 --> 02:29:49.313
IN HOW WE PAY COACHES AND

02:29:49.380 --> 02:29:50.548
ATHLETIC DIRECTORS I THINK

02:29:50.614 --> 02:29:52.416
YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT. AND I

02:29:52.483 --> 02:29:53.751
THINK THAT'S A WORD. VERSION OF

02:29:53.818 --> 02:29:56.420
BECAUSE AS- INTAKE GRADE HISTORY

02:29:56.487 --> 02:29:57.855
TEACHER A GREAT IN TEACHER

02:29:57.922 --> 02:30:00.224
CLAIMED RESEARCHER. MANY

02:30:00.291 --> 02:30:02.360
PUBLICATIONS AND THEY'RE JUST

02:30:02.426 --> 02:30:04.195
GETTING BY AND WE HAVE COACHES

02:30:04.261 --> 02:30:05.930
THE TACKETT GET ME IN THE

02:30:05.996 --> 02:30:08.499
MILLIONS SO I HEAR YOU THERE-

02:30:08.566 --> 02:30:09.834
BUT I'M NOT SO SURE THAT'S AN

02:30:09.900 --> 02:30:11.268
ISSUE OF THE ATHLETES BEING

02:30:11.335 --> 02:30:13.437
EXPLOITED. AND THAT WE NEED TO

02:30:13.504 --> 02:30:15.740
FIND A WAY TO CREATE THIS

02:30:15.806 --> 02:30:16.674
REVENUE GENERATOR WHICH YOU'RE

02:30:16.741 --> 02:30:19.210
TRYING TO DO HERE I DO THINK

02:30:19.276 --> 02:30:19.877
THAT ONE OF THE COMPONENTS THAT

02:30:19.944 --> 02:30:21.712
I LIKE ABOUT THIS BILL IS THAT

02:30:21.779 --> 02:30:23.748
IT FOCUSES ON GRADUATION.

02:30:23.814 --> 02:30:25.049
BECAUSE THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF

02:30:25.116 --> 02:30:27.118
EXPLOITATION OUR SYSTEM WHERE WE

02:30:27.184 --> 02:30:30.020
GET THE KIDS TO GET AT YOU KNOW.

02:30:30.087 --> 02:30:32.223
STUDY HARD GET INTO UNIVERSITY

02:30:32.289 --> 02:30:34.458
BOB. AND WHATEVER THEY NEED.

02:30:34.525 --> 02:30:36.694
FIVE GET THAT. I DO TO GET TAE

02:30:36.761 --> 02:30:38.863
THOSE CLASSES AND THEN BY MOST

02:30:38.929 --> 02:30:40.531
OF MANY OF THEM DON'T GET A

02:30:40.598 --> 02:30:41.699
DEGREE. AND THEY HAVE DEBT AND

02:30:41.766 --> 02:30:43.734
HAVE NOTHING THAT'S A BROADER

02:30:43.801 --> 02:30:45.369
ISSUE THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON

02:30:45.436 --> 02:30:46.804
AS YOU MAY KNOW IN THAT SPACE

02:30:46.871 --> 02:30:48.839
YOU'RE- IN THE SENATE PRIOR TO

02:30:48.906 --> 02:30:50.040
THAT THE- AT THE BOARD OF

02:30:50.107 --> 02:30:52.777
TRUSTEES. LEVEL SO I SEE THAT AS

02:30:52.843 --> 02:30:54.378
A GENERAL PROBLEM BUT YOU'RE A

02:30:54.445 --> 02:30:55.980
IT SEEMS LIKE IN THIS BILL. YOU

02:30:56.046 --> 02:30:58.215
FOCUS ON THAT GRADUATION ELEMENT

02:30:58.282 --> 02:31:00.718
THAT THAT EVEN. AFTER IS NOT

02:31:00.785 --> 02:31:02.286
ELIGIBLE FOR ANY MONEY OR A PART

02:31:02.353 --> 02:31:04.321
OF THIS MONEY AND LESS ACTUALLY

02:31:04.388 --> 02:31:06.123
GRADUATE IN SIX YEARS RESERVE

02:31:06.190 --> 02:31:07.892
THEY'RE NOT. ELIGIBLE UNLISTED

02:31:07.958 --> 02:31:09.794
GRADUATED SIX YEARS THAT THE COP

02:31:09.860 --> 02:31:12.430
IT ALL THE WAY. BASED ON THE

02:31:12.496 --> 02:31:14.432
FACTOR OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND.

02:31:14.498 --> 02:31:16.867
PER SEMESTER BUT THE RESERVE

02:31:16.934 --> 02:31:18.903
THAT'S PUT INTO GRADUATION POOL

02:31:18.969 --> 02:31:19.804
THEY CAN'T TOUCH THAT UNLESS

02:31:19.870 --> 02:31:21.071
THEY GRADUATE THEY HAVE TO

02:31:21.138 --> 02:31:22.239

ABOUT THIS BILL THAT I THAT I

02:31:27.578 --> 02:31:29.480
THINK IS GOING IN THE RIGHT

02:31:29.547 --> 02:31:31.182
DIRECTION I WOULD REALLY I THINK

02:31:31.248 --> 02:31:31.816
WE WOULD BENEFIT. FROM HAVING

02:31:31.882 --> 02:31:33.517
THESE REAL PRACTICAL EXAMPLES OF

02:31:33.584 --> 02:31:34.418
THE UNIVERSITY A HERE'S HOW IT

02:31:34.485 --> 02:31:36.153
WOULD WORK. UNIVERSITY BE HERE'S

02:31:36.220 --> 02:31:39.056

HELP ME AND I YOU KNOW THIS IS A

02:31:40.458 --> 02:31:42.526

TOUGH TIME GET MY HANDS AROUND

02:31:45.996 --> 02:31:47.264
TO KNOW EVERYTHING HERE BUT- WE

02:31:47.331 --> 02:31:48.866
DON'T I DON'T. AND I JUST RUBBLE

02:31:48.933 --> 02:31:50.234
WITH THIS ONE BECAUSE I KNOW

02:31:50.301 --> 02:31:51.569
YOUR HEARTS IN THAT DIRECTION

02:31:51.635 --> 02:31:52.837
ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO

02:31:52.903 --> 02:31:55.072
BUT I. I STILL STRUGGLING TO SEE

LEADS- BUT AT THIS BILL IS GONNA

THAT. THAT THE HEART IS IN THE

02:36:01.785 --> 02:36:03.420
RIGHT PLACE AND I THINK WITHOUT

HAVING A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL

02:36:05.289 --> 02:36:07.157
ABOUT EXACTLY HOW THIS WOULD

02:36:07.224 --> 02:36:08.325
WORK IN PRACTICE- THE SPONSOR

02:36:08.392 --> 02:36:10.227

02:42:36.913 --> 02:42:38.882
ATTENTION AWAY FROM EACH CHILD

02:42:38.949 --> 02:42:41.051
WHO SOMETIMES NEEDS SO MUCH

02:42:41.118 --> 02:42:42.786
ATTENTION AND THEY DESERVE

02:42:42.853 --> 02:42:45.422
CALIFORNIA IS BEHIND THE NATION

02:42:45.489 --> 02:42:47.958
WHEN IT COMES TO THE NUMBER OF

02:42:48.024 --> 02:42:48.525
STUDENTS PER TEACHER. SOME

02:42:48.592 --> 02:42:50.293
CLASSES ARE OVER THIRTY STUDENTS

02:42:50.360 --> 02:42:51.761
AND YET CALIFORNIA STATE

02:42:51.828 --> 02:42:54.464
STUDENTS HIGHER THAN THE

02:42:54.531 --> 02:42:56.233
NATIONAL AVERAGE EVERY CHILD IS

02:42:56.299 --> 02:42:58.401
DEFINITELY AND SMALLER CLASS

02:42:58.468 --> 02:42:59.836
SIZES ALLOW THE TEACHER TO GIVE

02:42:59.903 --> 02:43:01.404
THAT PERSONAL INSTRUCT

02:43:01.471 --> 02:43:02.706
PERSONALIZED INSTRUCTION TO

02:43:02.772 --> 02:43:03.974
STUDENTS TO INCREASE THEIR

02:43:04.040 --> 02:43:05.609
ACADEMIC AND PERSONAL

02:43:05.675 --> 02:43:07.377
ACHIEVEMENTS MEMBERS I

02:43:07.444 --> 02:43:10.480
PERSONALLY KNOW BECAUSE I'VE HAD

02:43:10.547 --> 02:43:13.216
CLASSES OF OVER THIRTY STUDENTS

02:43:13.283 --> 02:43:15.519
. IT MEANS IT DOES MEAN LAST. UP

02:43:15.585 --> 02:43:18.255
ATTENTION FOR EACH STUDENT YOU

02:43:18.321 --> 02:43:19.990
CANNOT GIVE THEM THAT INDIVIDUAL

02:43:20.056 --> 02:43:22.826
ICE- ATTENTION LAST TIME TO

02:43:22.893 --> 02:43:23.793
TUTOR AND CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT

02:43:23.860 --> 02:43:25.829
GAP. BUT ALSO MORE IMPORTANTLY

02:43:25.896 --> 02:43:27.264
LESS TIME TO COMMUNICATE WITH

02:43:27.330 --> 02:43:29.366
PARENTS AND CREATE THE NECESSARY

02:43:29.432 --> 02:43:30.734
PARTNERSHIPS AND RELATIONSHIPS

02:43:30.800 --> 02:43:34.070
THAT WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE

02:43:34.137 --> 02:43:35.272
STUDENTS SUCCEED. AND STUDIES

02:43:35.338 --> 02:43:36.506
HAVE SHOWN THAT STUDENTS WHO

02:43:36.573 --> 02:43:38.575
PARTICIPATE IN CALIFORNIA AS A

02:43:38.642 --> 02:43:40.343
CLASS SIZE REDUCTION PROGRAM

02:43:40.410 --> 02:43:42.345
PERFORM BETTER THAN STUDENTS

02:43:42.412 --> 02:43:44.147
REMAIN IN LARGER CLASSES

02:43:44.214 --> 02:43:45.715
ESPECIALLY AMONG LOWER INCOME

02:43:45.782 --> 02:43:47.684
AND STUDENTS OF COLOR. STUDIES

02:43:47.751 --> 02:43:49.286
ALSO SHOW THAT TEACHERS FEEL

02:43:49.352 --> 02:43:51.621
MORE POSITIVE AND THEIR ABILITY

02:43:51.688 --> 02:43:53.290
TO ASSESS AND MEET THE THEIR

02:43:53.356 --> 02:43:55.559
SPECIAL NEEDS I CAN SHARE FOR

02:43:55.625 --> 02:43:56.593
AGAIN FROM MY PERSONAL

02:43:56.660 --> 02:43:59.563
EXPERIENCE TEACHING. THAT I HAD

02:43:59.629 --> 02:44:01.565
TWENTY STUDENTS THE AVERAGE

02:44:01.631 --> 02:44:02.666
EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY STUDENTS IN

02:44:02.732 --> 02:44:05.202
MY CLASS AND AFTER THE CRISIS IN

02:44:05.268 --> 02:44:05.835
TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TWO THOUSAND

02:44:05.902 --> 02:44:07.637
EIGHT. MY CLASS WHO WENT UP TO

02:44:07.704 --> 02:44:09.105
UP TO THIRTY FOUR STUDENTS WHICH

02:44:09.172 --> 02:44:11.975
REALLY IMPACTED THE WAY I WAS

02:44:12.042 --> 02:44:13.743
ABLE TO INSTRUCT MY CLASS I

02:44:13.810 --> 02:44:16.146
DEDICATED PRIOR TO THE CRISIS I

02:44:16.213 --> 02:44:17.414
DEDICATED MOST OF MY TIME TO

02:44:17.480 --> 02:44:18.548
TUTORING BEFORE SCHOOL DURING

02:44:18.615 --> 02:44:20.951
RECESS LUNCH AFTER SCHOOL. THAT

02:44:21.017 --> 02:44:23.853
WAS ABLE TO REALLY CLOSE THE

02:44:23.920 --> 02:44:24.654
TREATMENT GAP SOMETIMES UP TO

02:44:24.721 --> 02:44:26.756
TWO GREAT LEVELS AFTER MY CLASS

02:44:26.823 --> 02:44:29.359
WENT UP TO THIRTY TWO THIRTY

02:44:29.426 --> 02:44:31.461
FOUR STUDENTS AND REALLY MY TIME

02:44:31.528 --> 02:44:33.196
WAS SPENT. GRADING MORE PAPERS

02:44:33.263 --> 02:44:37.000
SIDE. HOW TO SOME PLANS REALLY

02:44:37.067 --> 02:44:38.969
INDIVIDUALIZED INSTRUCTIONAL

02:44:39.035 --> 02:44:41.037
INSTRUCTION FOR ABOUT THREE TO

02:44:41.104 --> 02:44:42.672
FOUR LEVELS THAT WE HAD IN OUR

02:44:42.739 --> 02:44:43.640
CLASSROOMS AND SO I THINK IT'S

02:44:43.707 --> 02:44:46.109
SO IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT

02:44:46.176 --> 02:44:47.277
THE TIME THAT TEACHERS FAMILIES

02:44:47.344 --> 02:44:49.713
STUDENTS IS CRITICAL THE ONE ON

02:44:49.779 --> 02:44:51.681
ONE TIME TO JUST SEE WHERE

02:44:51.748 --> 02:44:53.750
THEY'RE AT AND REALLY GIVE THAT

02:44:53.817 --> 02:44:55.685
PERSONAL TIME IS VITAL BUT AGAIN

02:44:55.752 --> 02:44:57.854
AFTER THE TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY

02:44:57.921 --> 02:44:59.689
EIGHT CRISIS THAT PERSONAL TIME

02:44:59.756 --> 02:45:02.459
AND ABILITY FOR US TO- CLOSE THE

02:45:02.525 --> 02:45:05.729
TREATMENT GAP REALLY DID THAT

02:45:05.795 --> 02:45:07.197
INITIALLY. AND SO TODAY WE ARE

02:45:07.264 --> 02:45:08.898
HAVE TO CONSIDER HOW DO WE

02:45:08.965 --> 02:45:11.234
PRICES STATE SURPLUS LEAVE THAT

02:45:11.301 --> 02:45:12.602
THIS INVESTMENT IN OUR CHILDREN

02:45:12.669 --> 02:45:15.538
IS CRITICAL AND I THINK THAT-

02:45:15.605 --> 02:45:17.407
THE FOUNDATION S. AS BUILDS FROM

02:45:17.474 --> 02:45:19.242
KEIICHI THROUGH THREE AND IF WE

02:45:19.309 --> 02:45:20.577
MAKE SURE THAT OUR CHILDREN

02:45:20.644 --> 02:45:23.346
LEAVE K. THROUGH THREE BOB WITH

02:45:23.413 --> 02:45:24.948
A STRONG FOUNDATION AND MAKES IT

02:45:25.015 --> 02:45:27.384
EASIER FOR THEM TO MOVE THROUGH

02:45:27.450 --> 02:45:29.219
THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AND BE.

02:45:29.286 --> 02:45:31.721
OR LIKE. CAN ONLY HELP THE

02:45:31.788 --> 02:45:33.056
CHILDREN BUT IT ALSO HELPS THE

02:45:33.123 --> 02:45:34.991
TEACHERS THAT ARE STRUGGLING

02:45:35.058 --> 02:45:36.526
ESPECIALLY WITH THIS PANDEMIC

02:45:36.593 --> 02:45:38.528
WILL WITH SUCH. A LEARNING LOSS

02:45:38.595 --> 02:45:40.697
THAT WE'RE SEEING AND SO AGAIN

02:45:40.764 --> 02:45:42.532
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TWO GREAT

02:45:42.599 --> 02:45:44.034
ADVANTAGES WHEN IT COMES TO THIS

02:45:44.100 --> 02:45:45.568
BILL NUMBER ONE IS THAT CLASS

02:45:45.635 --> 02:45:47.971
SIZE REDUCTION HAS BEEN

02:45:48.038 --> 02:45:49.506
IMPLEMENTED BEFORE. SO THERE IS

02:45:49.572 --> 02:45:51.107
A MODEL WE KNOW HOW. SECOND WE

02:45:51.174 --> 02:45:53.877
DO. BUDGET SURPLUS TOOK TO IT

02:45:53.943 --> 02:45:56.513
ACHIEVE THIS. SO FURTHERMORE I

02:45:56.579 --> 02:45:58.415
YOU KNOW I ALSO AM WORKING ON

02:45:58.481 --> 02:46:00.083
COMPLEMENTARY LEGISLATION THAT I

02:46:00.150 --> 02:46:02.252
KNOW- HAVE BEEN RAISED AS

02:46:02.319 --> 02:46:04.254
CONCERNS AND- AND THAT IS

02:46:04.321 --> 02:46:05.622
REMOVING BARRIERS FOR. OUR

02:46:05.689 --> 02:46:07.157
TEACHER CANDIDATES TO WANT TO

02:46:07.223 --> 02:46:08.425
COME INTO THE PROFESSION AND

02:46:08.491 --> 02:46:09.726
ALSO PRETTY WORKING ON

02:46:09.793 --> 02:46:11.494
ADDRESSING THE TEACHER SHORTAGE.

02:46:11.561 --> 02:46:13.430
BUT AT THE ACADEMIC OF PROGRESS

02:46:13.496 --> 02:46:15.165
AND SUCCESS OF OUR STUDENTS IS

02:46:15.231 --> 02:46:17.233
REALLY CRITICAL TO ESSAY

02:46:17.300 --> 02:46:19.069
REQUIRES TO FOR US TO DO THAT.

02:46:19.135 --> 02:46:20.870
THE WORK INTO IT TO GET IT DONE

02:46:20.937 --> 02:46:23.273
AND SO- NOT ONLY FOR THE FUTURE

02:46:23.340 --> 02:46:25.475
OF THE STATE BUT I THINK IT'S

02:46:25.542 --> 02:46:26.710
ALSO OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO GET

02:46:26.776 --> 02:46:28.044
OUR CHILDREN WHERE THEY NEED TO

02:46:28.111 --> 02:46:31.214
BE. SB EIGHT FOURTEEN THIRTY ONE

02:46:31.281 --> 02:46:31.881

02:46:31.948 --> 02:46:33.383
FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER

02:46:33.450 --> 02:46:34.217
SCHOOLS. SO THEY CAN RECEIVE

02:46:34.284 --> 02:46:35.752
ADDITIONAL FUNDING BUT I REALLY

02:46:35.819 --> 02:46:37.787
WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THIS IS

02:46:37.854 --> 02:46:40.757
VOLUNTARY NOT MANDATORY. SO THAT

02:46:40.824 --> 02:46:42.726
THIS IS FOR- SCHOOL DISTRICTS

02:46:42.792 --> 02:46:44.694
THAT THEY WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE

02:46:44.761 --> 02:46:48.031

IN EDUCATION IN THE CLASSROOM

02:47:31.541 --> 02:47:33.109
FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS AND

02:47:33.176 --> 02:47:34.244
THAT CAN HELP CRITICAL SMALLER

02:47:34.310 --> 02:47:35.745
CLASS SIZES ARE NEEDED TO HELP

02:47:35.812 --> 02:47:38.681
ADVANCE THE ACADEMIC SUCCESS AND

02:47:38.748 --> 02:47:40.583
WELL BEING OF OUR STUDENTS. IT

02:47:40.650 --> 02:47:41.418
IS EXTREMELY DIVERSE. STUDENTS

02:47:41.484 --> 02:47:43.386
WITH DIFFERENT. WITH DIFFERENT

02:47:43.453 --> 02:47:44.654
ACADEMIC LEVELS IN OVERSIGHT

02:47:44.721 --> 02:47:46.589
CLASSROOMS. NO MATTER HOW MUCH

02:47:46.656 --> 02:47:48.391
YOU ALL TO YOUR LESSON PLANS IT

02:47:48.458 --> 02:47:49.659
IS IMPOSSIBLE TO MEET THE NEEDS

02:47:49.726 --> 02:47:51.861
OF ALL OF YOUR STUDENTS. I HAVE

02:47:51.928 --> 02:47:53.296
SEEN STUDENTS GET LOST IN THE

02:47:53.363 --> 02:47:53.930
SHUFFLE WITH OVERSIGHT

02:47:53.997 --> 02:47:55.598
CLASSROOMS STUDENTS LEARN HOW TO

02:47:55.665 --> 02:47:57.100
FADE INTO THE BACKGROUND AND DO

02:47:57.167 --> 02:47:58.535
NOT RECEIVE THE ATTENTION AND

02:47:58.601 --> 02:48:00.537
THE FOCUS THEY SO DESPERATELY

02:48:00.603 --> 02:48:01.671
NEED. THIS CAUSES LOW SELF

02:48:01.738 --> 02:48:03.473
ESTEEM AND STUDENTS AND IN MANY

02:48:03.540 --> 02:48:07.544
CASES STUDENTS AND GIVE UP

02:48:07.610 --> 02:48:08.578
BECAUSE THEY HAVE FALLEN BEHIND.

02:48:08.645 --> 02:48:10.613
AS A TEACHER I STRIVE TO MAKE

02:48:10.680 --> 02:48:12.248
SURE MY STUDENTS ARE. THE

02:48:12.315 --> 02:48:13.583
SUCCESSFUL BUT BECAUSE OF THE

02:48:13.650 --> 02:48:14.584
AMOUNT OF STUDENTS IN MY CLASS

02:48:14.651 --> 02:48:15.952
LIST THIS IS DIFFICULT TO

02:48:16.019 --> 02:48:17.921
ACHIEVE. THERE ARE SO MANY.

02:48:17.987 --> 02:48:19.022
MINUTES I HAVE TO READ

02:48:19.088 --> 02:48:20.657
EVERYTHING FOR EACH SUBJECT.

02:48:20.723 --> 02:48:21.658
ACCORDING TO PROVIDE ALL

02:48:21.724 --> 02:48:22.525
STUDENTS WITH AN EQUAL

02:48:22.592 --> 02:48:24.794
OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN TO RECEIVE

02:48:24.861 --> 02:48:26.229
SPECIALIZED ATTENTION AND TO

02:48:26.296 --> 02:48:27.797
PROVIDE EVERYONE WITH THE

02:48:27.864 --> 02:48:29.399
SUPPORT THEY NEED. INTO THE

02:48:29.466 --> 02:48:31.134
STUDY IN THE JOURNAL OF POLICY

02:48:31.201 --> 02:48:33.236
ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT. STATES

02:48:33.303 --> 02:48:35.171
THAT ATTENDING SMALL CONCRETE AS

02:48:35.238 --> 02:48:36.539
THE PROBABILITY OF EARNING A

02:48:36.606 --> 02:48:38.541
COLLEGE DEGREE AND TEACHES

02:48:38.608 --> 02:48:40.243
STUDENTS TOWARD EARNING DEGREES

02:48:40.310 --> 02:48:42.011
AND HIGH EARNING FIELDS SUCH AS

02:48:42.078 --> 02:48:44.547
SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY ENGINEERING

02:48:44.614 --> 02:48:46.749
AND MATHEMATICS BUSINESS AND

02:48:46.816 --> 02:48:49.652
ECONOMICS. WE TEACHERS DO OUR

02:48:49.719 --> 02:48:50.854
BEST ALREADY NOW BUT IT IS

02:48:50.920 --> 02:48:52.355
DIFFICULT WHEN THERE IS A

02:48:52.422 --> 02:48:53.923
LIMITED TIME BECAUSE WE HAVE SO

02:48:53.990 --> 02:48:55.525
MANY STUDENTS WE NEED TO ATTEND

02:48:55.592 --> 02:48:57.594
TO. BECAUSE WE ARE STILL COMING

02:48:57.660 --> 02:48:58.928
UP. TEACHERS NEED TO BE

02:48:58.995 --> 02:48:59.829
COGNIZANT THAT PROVIDE STUDENTS

02:48:59.896 --> 02:49:00.997
WITH NOT JUST THE ACADEMIC

02:49:01.064 --> 02:49:03.233
SUPPORT BUT ALSO THE SOCIAL

02:49:03.299 --> 02:49:05.101
SOCIAL EMOTIONAL SUPPORT TO

02:49:05.168 --> 02:49:06.169
ESTABLISH NURTURING

02:49:06.236 --> 02:49:09.606
RELATIONSHIPS AND HELP THEM

02:49:09.672 --> 02:49:11.441
SUCCEED LATER ON IN SCHOOL. SB

02:49:11.508 --> 02:49:12.442
FORTY THIRTY ONE WHAT DO THAT.

02:49:12.509 --> 02:49:13.643
IT WILL ALLOW STUDENTS TO

02:49:13.710 --> 02:49:15.645
RECEIVE CRITICAL INDIVIDUALIZED

02:49:15.712 --> 02:49:16.646
ATTENTION AND INTERACTION WITH

02:49:16.713 --> 02:49:18.348
TEACHERS. I INTERRUPTED BY THE

02:49:18.414 --> 02:49:20.617
LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCY TO LOWER

TO COLLECT QUANTITATIVE DATA

03:05:45.200 --> 03:05:46.702

NOT VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE AD

03:06:52.568 --> 03:06:54.803

GUESS IS I LOOK AT THIS BILL I

03:07:15.791 --> 03:07:17.659
THINK THAT IN SOME WAYS ARE KIND

03:07:17.726 --> 03:07:19.061
OF REAP FIGHTING AN EXISTING

03:07:19.127 --> 03:07:21.063
AGREEMENT THE- PATTERNS FOR HOW.

03:07:21.129 --> 03:07:22.431
PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS WERE TO

03:07:22.497 --> 03:07:23.599
CONDUCT THEMSELVES INCLUDING IN

03:07:23.665 --> 03:07:25.400
REGARD TO BUT THE RETIREMENT.

03:07:25.467 --> 03:07:27.202
CIRCUMSTANCES SOMETHING THAT.

03:07:27.269 --> 03:07:29.638
WERE VISITING IN THIS BILL AND

03:07:29.705 --> 03:07:31.039
LET ME JUST SAY THAT I. I

03:07:31.106 --> 03:07:33.642
SUPPORT- YOU KNOW A I WANT A

03:07:33.709 --> 03:07:37.279
ROBUST. THE RETIREMENT SYSTEM

03:07:37.346 --> 03:07:39.247
FOR ALL OF OUR- SCHOOL TO. AND

03:07:39.314 --> 03:07:41.216
WHEREVER THEY ARE WHETHER IT'S

03:07:41.283 --> 03:07:42.818
IN THE CHARTER SCHOOL COMMUNITY

03:07:42.884 --> 03:07:46.688
WHETHER IT'S ENOUGH SCHOOL. THE

03:07:46.755 --> 03:07:51.627
BILL EITHER. PUBLIC THAT. THE

03:07:51.693 --> 03:07:54.062
METAL TAG WE'RE ALL. EIGHT GUARD

03:07:54.129 --> 03:07:56.465
. ARTIST THE STAFF PUSH ONE OF

03:07:56.531 --> 03:07:58.967
THE SCHOOL. I CHARGE AT LEAST

03:07:59.034 --> 03:07:59.668
THAT THEY PER. AND ALTER EVERY

03:07:59.735 --> 03:08:01.036
BENEFIT AND THEY HAVE CHOICES

03:08:01.103 --> 03:08:02.404
AND THAT COULD BE SOCIAL

03:08:02.471 --> 03:08:04.239
SECURITY. AND YOU KNOW THERE'S

03:08:04.306 --> 03:08:06.108
SOME ISSUES OF SOCIAL SECURITY

03:08:06.174 --> 03:08:08.010
BUT WE WON'T GET INTO THOSE HERE

03:08:08.076 --> 03:08:10.245
TODAY. AS WELL AS A- A FOUR OH

03:08:10.312 --> 03:08:12.748
ONE K. PROGRAM- AS WELL AS AS

03:08:12.814 --> 03:08:14.850
CASTERS SO IT SEEMS LIKE AND

03:08:14.916 --> 03:08:17.285
LESS THOSE ARE FLAWED SYSTEMS.

03:08:17.352 --> 03:08:18.820
THAT THOSE CHOICES ARE

03:08:18.887 --> 03:08:21.490
LEGITIMATE CHOICES HAPPENED- IT

03:08:21.556 --> 03:08:23.025
RAISES QUESTIONS AS TO WHY WOULD

03:08:23.091 --> 03:08:26.328
WE REVISIT THAT CHOICE YOUR DAY

03:08:26.395 --> 03:08:27.729
AND THE ONLY THING THAT I CAN

03:08:27.796 --> 03:08:29.464
SEE ON THE RECORD. ABOUT THE

03:08:29.531 --> 03:08:31.266
REASON TO PUT IT OUT SEVEN

03:08:31.333 --> 03:08:32.734
ANECDOTE ABOUT OF A CHARTER

03:08:32.801 --> 03:08:34.503
SCHOOL FAILING IS THAT. SOMEHOW

03:08:34.569 --> 03:08:36.638
IT'S IT SUPPORTS THE SYSTEM THE

03:08:36.705 --> 03:08:39.408
RETIREMENT SYSTEM. I DON'T THINK

03:08:39.474 --> 03:08:40.642
THERE ARE ENOUGH CHARTER SCHOOLS

03:08:40.709 --> 03:08:42.177
GOING FORWARD BECAUSE AS YOU

03:08:42.244 --> 03:08:45.547
**** WILL BE PROSPECTIVE SO I

03:08:45.614 --> 03:08:47.215
DON'T THINK WE AND OF CHARTER

03:08:47.282 --> 03:08:50.052
SCHOOLS OPEN. PRESS IT BUILD UP

03:08:50.118 --> 03:08:52.287
THIS WHICH THE SYSTEM FOR ME

03:08:52.354 --> 03:08:54.256
THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT

03:08:54.322 --> 03:08:56.124
PEOPLE HAVE A DEFINED BENEFIT

03:08:56.191 --> 03:08:59.594
PENSION THAT TIRE IN DIG UP THE

03:08:59.661 --> 03:09:01.129
BIGGEST GROUP OF PEOPLE LIVING

03:09:01.196 --> 03:09:03.832
IN POVERTY TODAY ARE WOMEN OVER

03:09:03.899 --> 03:09:04.966
SIXTY FIVE MOST OF OUR TEACHERS

03:09:05.033 --> 03:09:07.602
IN ANY SCHOOL SETTING OUR LIMITS

03:09:07.669 --> 03:09:08.904
SO THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE

03:09:08.970 --> 03:09:11.807
THAT WOMEN AND TEACHERS OF UP TO

03:09:11.873 --> 03:09:14.176
HAVE A SECURE RETIREMENT I WOULD

03:09:14.242 --> 03:09:17.079
SAY THAT I DON'T LOOK AT A FOUR

03:09:17.145 --> 03:09:18.413
ONE K. AS A GREAT RETIREMENT

03:09:18.480 --> 03:09:20.515
FROM THE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY AT

03:09:20.582 --> 03:09:22.918
THE- RECEIPT OF THE- MARKET. THE

03:09:22.984 --> 03:09:24.619
TO. PUT PENSION YOU KNOW WHAT

03:09:24.686 --> 03:09:25.754
YOU'RE GOING TO RECEIVE EVERY

03:09:25.821 --> 03:09:27.656
SINGLE MONTH AND YOU CAN PLAN

03:09:27.723 --> 03:09:29.624
YOUR LIFE AROUND US SO FOR ME

03:09:29.691 --> 03:09:31.059
THIS IS A- BILL THAT IS ABOUT

03:09:31.126 --> 03:09:32.594
THE SECURITY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

03:09:32.661 --> 03:09:34.062
WORKING AND MAKING SURE WHEN

03:09:34.129 --> 03:09:35.630
THEY RETIRE. THEY CAN BE SECURE

03:09:35.697 --> 03:09:39.501
IN THE RETIREMENT. IT IS NOT

03:09:39.568 --> 03:09:41.236
GOING TO PROP UP CAL STIRS ARE

03:09:41.303 --> 03:09:42.537
CALPERS AT. THAT ALTHOUGH THERE

03:09:42.604 --> 03:09:44.606
WAS A- IN THE IN HOUSE TO TALK

03:09:44.673 --> 03:09:45.741
ABOUT HOW. A NEW FOLKS COME IN

03:09:45.807 --> 03:09:47.642
THE SYSTEM WOULD PROVIDE GREATER

03:09:47.709 --> 03:09:49.511
CAPITAL THAT WOULD. IMPROVE THE

03:09:49.578 --> 03:09:51.079
THAT THE STABILITY IS CERTAINLY

03:09:51.146 --> 03:09:52.247
PUT MORE MONEY INTO SOMETHING

03:09:52.314 --> 03:09:53.882
IT'S GOING TO IT'S GOING TO HELP

03:09:53.949 --> 03:09:55.650
BUT IT WILL NOT IT WOULD NOT

03:09:55.717 --> 03:09:57.486
PROP UP THE SYSTEM THERE'S JUST

03:09:57.552 --> 03:09:59.554
NOT ENOUGH MONEY. THERE WOULD

03:09:59.621 --> 03:10:00.789
NOT BE ENOUGH PEOPLE

03:10:00.856 --> 03:10:03.191
PROSPECTIVELY TO DO THAT. THINGS

03:10:03.258 --> 03:10:04.659
IT'S PRETTY COOL. THAT OUR

03:10:04.726 --> 03:10:06.228
ATTENTION SYSTEMS BOTH CALPERS

03:10:06.294 --> 03:10:07.996
AND CAL STIRS HAVE BEEN UNDER

03:10:08.063 --> 03:10:10.398
WATER FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND-

03:10:10.465 --> 03:10:11.700
AND THEY'RE SUBJECT TO THE STOCK

MARKET TO. IN TERMS OF THE GOING

03:10:13.468 --> 03:10:15.871
UP AND GOING IN A VERY DIFFERENT

03:10:15.937 --> 03:10:16.738
WAY I WILL NOT A PENSION FUND

DEALING WITH THAT TYPE OF A

03:10:33.155 --> 03:10:34.756
CRISIS THAT IS CORRECT AND- BUT

03:10:34.823 --> 03:10:36.691
IN IN THE CASE OF OUR PUBLIC

03:10:36.758 --> 03:10:38.894

YOU CAN MAKE SOME CHOICES IN

03:10:55.610 --> 03:10:56.812

SOMETHING THAT. I DON'T. KNOW

03:11:10.492 --> 03:11:11.693
THAT WE REALLY NEED TO RE FIGHT

03:11:11.760 --> 03:11:13.628
THERE'S NO CLEAR EVIDENCE ON THE

03:11:13.695 --> 03:11:15.964
RECORD THAT WE HAVE A REAL

03:11:16.031 --> 03:11:16.898
PROBLEM OUT THERE. THAT WE'RE

03:11:16.965 --> 03:11:19.234

SOLUTION. THE PUBLIC CHARTERS IS

03:12:06.915 --> 03:12:08.683

03:12:19.060 --> 03:12:21.162
I WANT TO ECHO THE CONCERNS THAT

03:12:21.229 --> 03:12:22.764
SENATOR GLAZER WE SEEN THIS IN

03:12:22.831 --> 03:12:25.433

THE EVENINGS AND I THINK ABOUT

03:12:31.506 --> 03:12:33.275
MY VOTED I THINK ABOUT THAT A

03:12:33.341 --> 03:12:34.609
LITTLE FURTHER TO TRY TO. SEE

03:12:34.676 --> 03:12:36.878
WHETHER OR NOT I WAS ON THE

03:12:36.945 --> 03:12:37.612
RIGHT TRACK OR NOT RIGHT TRACK

03:12:37.679 --> 03:12:40.482
OR WHAT WE COULD DO BETTER ON

03:12:40.548 --> 03:12:41.116
THAT I'M ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT

03:12:41.182 --> 03:12:42.584
HOW TO YOU KNOW CREATE GOOD

03:12:42.651 --> 03:12:45.487

KNOW I AM A- I'M AN ADVOCATE FOR

03:12:55.096 --> 03:12:56.331
INSTRUCTION BECAUSE I THINK THAT

03:12:56.398 --> 03:12:57.799
IS CONCEPTUALLY THROUGH THE

03:12:57.866 --> 03:12:58.667
STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT IT'S

03:12:58.733 --> 03:13:00.568
OUR DUTY TO DO THAT AND MAKING

03:13:00.635 --> 03:13:02.370
SURE YOU KNOW THEY HAVE WHAT

03:13:02.437 --> 03:13:04.339
THEY NEED IN ORDER TO DO THAT.

03:13:04.406 --> 03:13:06.141
THE CONCERN CARE- ARE BUT

SENATOR LEISURE HAS ALSO HAS

03:13:08.510 --> 03:13:10.312
CONCERNS BUT ALSO IN ADDITION TO

03:13:10.378 --> 03:13:13.415
THAT IS THAT WHEN IT COMES TO

03:13:13.481 --> 03:13:18.887
THE RETIREMENT IN THE CHOICES-

03:13:18.954 --> 03:13:20.689

THROUGHOUT MAKING TEACH AT A

03:13:25.160 --> 03:13:27.462
PUBLIC SCHOOL THEY CAN. TEACH AT

03:13:27.529 --> 03:13:30.098
A CHARTER SCHOOL. ANALYZING HOW

03:13:30.165 --> 03:13:31.433
MUCH THE PAY WILL BE THE

03:13:31.499 --> 03:13:33.101
FLEXIBILITY THE SUBJECT MATTER

03:13:33.168 --> 03:13:36.137
HOW MANY STUDENTS- RETIREMENT

03:13:36.204 --> 03:13:38.073
BENEFITS THEY ALL TAKE THAT INTO

03:13:38.139 --> 03:13:39.741
CONSIDERATION AS FAR AS THE

03:13:39.808 --> 03:13:42.344
PACKAGES GO TO DECIDE THIS IS

03:13:42.410 --> 03:13:45.447
THE BEST A SITE OUT FOR ME OR

THE BEST PACKAGE FOR ME SO THEY

03:13:47.816 --> 03:13:50.652

03:13:50.719 --> 03:13:53.355
WITH THE CHARTER SCHOOLS IN WILK

03:13:53.421 --> 03:13:55.790

CHOOSE FROM WHAT BEST SUITS THEM

03:14:02.464 --> 03:14:06.334
I THINK THAT IS WHAT IS SO- IT'S

03:14:06.401 --> 03:14:08.036
VERY MUCH AN AMERICAN IDEAL TO

03:14:08.103 --> 03:14:10.205
HAVE CHOICE. FOR THE STATE

03:14:10.271 --> 03:14:11.573
LEADERS OF THE LEGISLATURE TO

03:14:11.639 --> 03:14:14.109
SAY THIS IS HOW OUR TEACHERS ARE

03:14:14.175 --> 03:14:17.779
GOING TO- CONTINUE OR ARE HAPPY

03:14:17.846 --> 03:14:21.649
THIS RETIREMENT- WITH THE- IN

SECURITIES THAT WE MAY HAVE

03:14:23.351 --> 03:14:25.220
THERE IS NO SECURE SYSTEM IN IN

03:14:25.286 --> 03:14:26.621
THE RETIREMENT SYSTEM BECAUSE

03:14:26.688 --> 03:14:28.189
AS- MY COLLEAGUE STATED. THEY

03:14:28.256 --> 03:14:31.559
ARE DEPENDENT ON ON ON THE

03:14:31.626 --> 03:14:33.395
CHOICES THAT WE MAKE INVESTMENTS

03:14:33.461 --> 03:14:37.632
CASTERS ANSWERS SO I. SO I AM.

03:14:37.699 --> 03:14:40.535
AYE AYE A- I WAS GRAPPLING WITH

03:14:40.602 --> 03:14:42.804
THIS BUT I BUT I WANNA JUST MAKE

03:14:42.871 --> 03:14:44.239
SURE THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT.

03:14:44.305 --> 03:14:45.707
CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE THERE TO

03:14:45.774 --> 03:14:48.443
PROVIDE OPTIONS AND CHOICES THE

03:14:48.510 --> 03:14:50.845
STATE COMING IN AND TELLING THEM

03:14:50.912 --> 03:14:52.347
THIS IS HOW YOU'RE GOING TO DO

03:14:52.414 --> 03:14:54.716
IT. LIMITS THE CHOICES FOR BOTH

03:14:54.783 --> 03:14:59.220
pTHAT CHOOSE TO FOLLOW AND I

03:14:59.287 --> 03:15:02.857
PACKED UP ON THAT MATTER AND-

03:15:02.924 --> 03:15:04.259
SLEEVE THERE WAS ONE OTHER POINT

03:15:04.325 --> 03:15:06.194
THAT OUT TO MAKE- AND THAT'S

03:15:06.261 --> 03:15:08.863
WITH REGARDS TO- SOME OF THE

03:15:08.930 --> 03:15:10.365
THINGS THAT I'VE SEEN THIS PAST

03:15:10.432 --> 03:15:12.567
YEAR SINCE BEEN ELECTED. IS THAT

03:15:12.634 --> 03:15:14.102
OUR SCHOOLS ARE CHARTER SCHOOLS

03:15:14.169 --> 03:15:16.871
ARE SOMETIMES EXCLUDED FROM

03:15:16.938 --> 03:15:19.307
CERTAIN FINDINGS- THAT ARE

03:15:19.374 --> 03:15:21.643
AVAILABLE TO OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS-

03:15:21.709 --> 03:15:23.411
DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF CHARTER

03:15:23.478 --> 03:15:24.846
SCHOOL THAT THEY HAVE SO THEY

03:15:24.913 --> 03:15:27.649
HAVE TO GRAPPLE. IN MY IN MY

03:15:27.715 --> 03:15:31.419
PERSPECTIVE THIS PAST YEAR- IS A

03:15:31.486 --> 03:15:32.487
LITTLE BIT OVER A YEAR THAT.

03:15:32.554 --> 03:15:34.289
THEY HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL

03:15:34.355 --> 03:15:36.524
CHALLENGES TO OVERCOME BECAUSE

03:15:36.591 --> 03:15:38.093
OF THE POLICIES THAT THE STATE

03:15:38.159 --> 03:15:40.095
LEGISLATURE LEGISLATURE CHOOSES

03:15:40.161 --> 03:15:41.830
TO PURSUE WITH REGARDS TO

03:15:41.896 --> 03:15:44.432
CHARTER SCHOOLS SO. BY LIMITING

03:15:44.499 --> 03:15:46.301
THEM AND HAVING CERTAIN

03:15:46.367 --> 03:15:49.637
PARAMETERS AS TO YOU KNOW WHAT

03:15:49.704 --> 03:15:50.538
FUNDING THEY CAN AND CANNOT

03:15:50.605 --> 03:15:52.407
RECEIVE UNLIKE OUR PUBLIC

03:15:52.474 --> 03:15:54.476
SCHOOLS AND THEN TO COME IN AND

03:15:54.542 --> 03:15:55.844
SAID THIS IS THE- THIS IS YOUR

03:15:55.910 --> 03:15:57.579
PATH. TO WITH THEIR RETIREMENT

03:15:57.645 --> 03:16:00.181
SYSTEMS YOU YOU YOU HAVE TO TAKE

03:16:00.248 --> 03:16:02.484
I THINK IT'S A BIT UNFAIR. TO

03:16:02.550 --> 03:16:05.186
OUR CHARTER SCHOOLS AND- THAT'S

03:16:05.253 --> 03:16:06.888
THE LAWSUIT HI. THAT'S ALL I

03:16:06.955 --> 03:16:09.023
HAVE TO SAY A BIG THANK YOU

03:16:09.090 --> 03:16:10.258
SENATOR TOBER WHEN DID YOU FIRST

03:16:10.325 --> 03:16:11.459

FORTY NINE FORTY NINE SO WHEN

03:16:17.765 --> 03:16:19.601
YOU TALK ABOUT FORTY EIGHT OKAY

03:16:19.667 --> 03:16:21.369
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT TEACHERS

03:16:21.436 --> 03:16:22.871
COMING IN AND HAVING THESE

03:16:22.937 --> 03:16:24.439
CHOICES AND HAVING A MENU OF.

03:16:24.506 --> 03:16:25.573
MAKING THAT DECISION OF WHAT

03:16:25.640 --> 03:16:27.809
THEY WANT TO DO- IF YOU JUST

03:16:27.876 --> 03:16:29.410
LEARNED ABOUT WHAT IT FIND

03:16:29.477 --> 03:16:31.079
BENEFIT PENSION BUYS AT FORTY

03:16:31.146 --> 03:16:32.013
NINE YEARS OLD IF I'M

GRADUATING. FROM COLLEGE AND I'M

03:16:35.049 --> 03:16:37.252
GONNA BE TEACHING AND I'M TWENTY

03:16:37.318 --> 03:16:38.186
FOUR TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD I

03:16:38.253 --> 03:16:39.454
PROBABLY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT

03:16:39.521 --> 03:16:40.755
DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AS- IS

03:16:40.822 --> 03:16:42.824
REALLY BY CHOICE THERE FOR MAYBE

03:16:42.891 --> 03:16:43.958
I DON'T KNOW HOW. MANY PEOPLE

03:16:44.025 --> 03:16:46.094
ARE VERY ENAMORED WITH FOR ONE

03:16:46.161 --> 03:16:48.129
CASE WHEN I WAS IN THE- WHEN I

03:16:48.196 --> 03:16:53.034
REMEMBER ONE OF. MY MEN PERCENT

03:16:53.101 --> 03:16:55.270
. HI D. KNOW THAT ONE OF FRIENDS

03:16:55.336 --> 03:16:56.371
IS RE. FOR MERVYN'S AND SHE HAS

03:16:56.437 --> 03:16:58.473
A THOUSAND. FOUR ONE K. WHY

03:16:58.540 --> 03:16:59.607
DON'T I HAVE THAT. I SAID

03:16:59.674 --> 03:17:01.543
BECAUSE WHAT YOU HAVE IS YOU

03:17:01.609 --> 03:17:02.143
HAVE A DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION

03:17:02.210 --> 03:17:03.711
THAT MEANS YOU WILL COLLECT. THE

03:17:03.778 --> 03:17:04.646
SAME AMOUNT WHATEVER DOES DEPEND

03:17:04.712 --> 03:17:06.548
ON THE AMOUNT OF YEARS YOU

03:17:06.614 --> 03:17:08.716
WORKED FOR THE REST OF YOUR

03:17:08.783 --> 03:17:09.817
LIFE. WHEN YOU HAVE A FOUR ONE

03:17:09.884 --> 03:17:10.718
K. THEORETICALLY YOU'RE SUPPOSED

03:17:10.785 --> 03:17:12.353
TO LIVE OFF THE INTEREST OF

03:17:12.420 --> 03:17:13.655
THAT. SO LET'S SAY THAT YOU CAN

03:17:13.721 --> 03:17:15.590
GET A 10% RETURN WHICH IS

03:17:15.657 --> 03:17:17.692
UNHEARD OF NO ONE'S GOING TO GET

03:17:17.759 --> 03:17:19.527
A 10% RETURN. ON THEIR

03:17:19.594 --> 03:17:20.962
INVESTMENT THAT WOULD MEAN YOU

03:17:21.029 --> 03:17:23.264
TO. TEN THOUSAND. A YEAR IF YOU.

03:17:23.331 --> 03:17:23.831
HAVE ON THAT TEN THOUSAND

03:17:23.898 --> 03:17:25.466
DOLLARS A YEAR BECAUSE YOU FOUND

03:17:25.533 --> 03:17:26.301
THAT 10% RETURN. THAT YOU

03:17:26.367 --> 03:17:27.735
WEREN'T PULLING AWAY AT YOUR

03:17:27.802 --> 03:17:29.103
NEST EGG AND IT'S GETTING

03:17:29.170 --> 03:17:30.939
SMALLER AND SMALLER EVERY YEAR.

03:17:31.005 --> 03:17:33.174
SO MY POINT IS YOU DIDN'T KNOW

03:17:33.241 --> 03:17:34.509
WHAT IT DEFINED BENEFIT WAS INTO

03:17:34.576 --> 03:17:37.612
YOUR- A LITTLE BIT OLDER IN

03:17:37.679 --> 03:17:39.047
LIFE. WE'RE ASKING YOU'RE A

03:17:39.113 --> 03:17:40.515
THREE YEAR FOR EXAMPLE WERE

03:17:40.582 --> 03:17:41.916
TELLING THESE YOUNG PEOPLE MAKE

03:17:41.983 --> 03:17:43.518
A DECISION MAKE A CHOICE. THEY

03:17:43.585 --> 03:17:45.086
DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY'RE

03:17:45.153 --> 03:17:47.355
CHOOSING SO MANY OF US WANT TO

03:17:47.422 --> 03:17:50.792
HELP THEM. TO MAKE A CHOICE THAT

03:17:50.858 --> 03:17:52.594
WILL HELP THEM IN SECURE TO BE

03:17:52.660 --> 03:17:55.630
SECURE IN THEIR RETIREMENT. BUT

03:17:55.697 --> 03:17:57.565
YOU'RE SO CENTER GLAZE I THINK

03:17:57.632 --> 03:17:58.633
WE JUST HAVE SOME. FUNDAMENTAL

03:17:58.700 --> 03:18:00.001
DIFFERENCES AND AGAIN. THIS IS

03:18:00.068 --> 03:18:01.903
ABOUT MAKING SURE. PEOPLE CAN

03:18:01.970 --> 03:18:05.073
RETIREMENT RETIRE. AND BE ABLE

03:18:05.139 --> 03:18:06.441
TO PAY THEIR BILLS WHEN I TALK

03:18:06.507 --> 03:18:08.810
TO YOUNG PEOPLE- I WAS SAID TO

03:18:08.876 --> 03:18:10.278
THEM. WHO KNOWS WHAT RETIREMENT

03:18:10.345 --> 03:18:12.614
IS WHO KNOWS WHAT IT IS TO HAVE

03:18:12.680 --> 03:18:13.982
A PENSION. MOST OF THEM DON'T

03:18:14.048 --> 03:18:16.451
KNOW. WHAT I TELL THEM IS WHEN

03:18:16.517 --> 03:18:17.552
YOU RETIRE YOU WANT TO BE ABLE

03:18:17.619 --> 03:18:20.121
TO EAT. SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE

03:18:20.188 --> 03:18:21.489
YOU HAVE A JOB. THAT HAS A

03:18:21.556 --> 03:18:23.157
PENSION. MAKING SURE. TEACHERS

03:18:23.224 --> 03:18:24.692
WHO ARE TEACHING OUR FUTURE

03:18:24.759 --> 03:18:25.727
LEADERS HAVE A SECURE

03:18:25.793 --> 03:18:27.629
RETIREMENT. I PERSONALLY THINK

03:18:27.695 --> 03:18:29.330
THAT THAT IS A LAUDABLE GOAL AND

03:18:29.397 --> 03:18:30.832
SOMETHING EACH AND EVERYONE OF

03:18:30.898 --> 03:18:32.600
US. SHOULD BE PASSIONATE ABOUT

03:18:32.667 --> 03:18:34.302
BECAUSE- WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

03:18:34.369 --> 03:18:35.403
PEOPLE CAN'T PAY THEIR BILLS

03:18:35.470 --> 03:18:36.771
WHEN THEY'RE OLDER. THAN THEY GO

03:18:36.838 --> 03:18:38.640
ON THE END UP ON THE STREETS OR

03:18:38.706 --> 03:18:41.009
THE END UP LIVING WITH FAMILY.

03:18:41.075 --> 03:18:42.010
IT'S ABOUT DIGNITY IT'S ABOUT

03:18:42.076 --> 03:18:43.177
RESPECT IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE

03:18:43.244 --> 03:18:44.612
PEOPLE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

03:18:44.679 --> 03:18:47.782
TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES AND

03:18:47.849 --> 03:18:48.416

STATE OR SCHOOL BOARD OR ARE IN

03:19:25.553 --> 03:19:28.256
SCHOOL OR- LOCAL DISTRICT AND IT

03:19:28.323 --> 03:19:30.291
IS ALL BASED OFF OF. IF THAT

03:19:30.358 --> 03:19:32.327
DEFINED BENEFIT GOES UPSIDE DOWN

03:19:32.393 --> 03:19:34.095
ON THE INVESTMENTS. THE

03:19:34.162 --> 03:19:35.897
TAXPAYERS ON THE HOOK FOR THE

03:19:35.963 --> 03:19:37.865

RIGHT NOW AND A LOT AND THEN THE

03:19:52.080 --> 03:19:53.948
OTHER WE ALL OVER THE STATE

03:19:54.015 --> 03:19:55.850
BECAUSE EVERY YOU KNOW EVERY-

03:19:55.917 --> 03:19:57.752
MUNICIPALITY HAS A DIFFERENT

03:19:57.819 --> 03:20:01.222
SYSTEM SO. TRUST ME WHEN THE

03:20:01.289 --> 03:20:02.724

THOSE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE IT

03:20:06.694 --> 03:20:08.396
BECAUSE IN MY DISTRICT WAS THE

03:20:08.463 --> 03:20:10.298
FIRST COMMUNITY THAT WE SAW. A

03:20:10.365 --> 03:20:12.300

03:20:16.537 --> 03:20:17.438
YEAR AND WENT TO NINETEEN

03:20:17.505 --> 03:20:19.307
BECAUSE IT'S REALLY BASED OFF OF

03:20:19.374 --> 03:20:21.175
WHAT'S IN THE FUND. AND SO.

03:20:21.242 --> 03:20:24.112
REMIND YOU. YOU CAN TALK ABOUT

03:20:24.178 --> 03:20:25.680
IT BUT IT IS TIED TO THE STOCK

03:20:25.747 --> 03:20:26.981
MARKET AND THE COMPANY WORK FOR

03:20:27.048 --> 03:20:28.716
IS THE STATE OR THE CITY OR

03:20:28.783 --> 03:20:29.650
COUNTY WHATEVER IT IS. AND

03:20:29.717 --> 03:20:32.320

03:20:35.957 --> 03:20:36.524

DEPEND ON THE STOCK MARKET YES

03:20:49.737 --> 03:20:52.407
THEY ARE BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS

03:20:52.473 --> 03:20:54.575
ONE IS MUCH BIGGER AND CAN TAKE

03:20:54.642 --> 03:20:56.711
LOSSES. CAN TAKE KIDS. IF I HAD

03:20:56.778 --> 03:20:58.413

03:21:03.184 --> 03:21:04.986
TIME FOR WHEN I RETIRE. THAT'S

03:21:05.052 --> 03:21:06.487
STILL A CHOICE THAT SOMEBODY CAN

03:21:06.554 --> 03:21:09.190
MAKE. LIFE IS FULL OF CHOICES

03:21:09.257 --> 03:21:11.793
