THIS UP TO EVERYONE ON THE

00:40:05.803 --> 00:40:06.871
FUNDING WOULD BE SLIGHTLY

00:40:06.937 --> 00:40:08.372
DIFFERENT IF WE WERE OPENING IT

00:40:08.439 --> 00:40:10.174
UP I THINK THE TARGET --

00:40:10.241 --> 00:40:12.376
HERE HAS TO DO WITH THOSE THAT

00:40:12.443 --> 00:40:14.378
ARE MOST DISADVANTAGED ON THAT

00:40:14.445 --> 00:40:15.813
DOESN'T MEAN THAT THERE'S NOT

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.281
OTHERS WHO ARE DISADVANTAGED IN

00:40:17.348 --> 00:40:20.117
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE STOP.

00:40:20.184 --> 00:40:21.886
ENSURING THAT WE WORK TO HELP

00:40:21.952 --> 00:40:25.422

00:40:25.489 --> 00:40:27.091
IT IS LIMITED IN SCOPE --

00:40:27.158 --> 00:40:28.492
IT ALSO MEANS IT'S LIMITED IN

00:40:28.559 --> 00:40:30.628
FUNDING BUT CERTAINLY IF THERE

00:40:30.694 --> 00:40:32.663
WERE WAYS IN TERMS OF INCREASING

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:33.831
ACCESS --

00:40:33.898 --> 00:40:35.466
GENERALLY THOSE WOULD.

00:40:35.533 --> 00:40:37.434
BE IDEAS THAT I WOULD BE VERY

00:40:37.501 --> 00:40:39.637
OPEN TO AT THIS BILL DID GET OUT

00:40:39.703 --> 00:40:40.971
WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT LAST

00:40:41.038 --> 00:40:42.640
YEAR AND WE INCLUDED AN

00:40:42.706 --> 00:40:43.841
AMENDMENT IN THE BILL.

00:40:43.908 --> 00:40:46.777
ABOUT A ACCESS TO THE OUTDOORS --

00:40:46.844 --> 00:40:48.846
THAT WAS NOT LIMITED TO ANY ONE

00:40:48.913 --> 00:40:50.314
PARTICULAR GROUP IS VERY FOCUSED

00:40:50.381 --> 00:40:52.316
ON MY VERY SPECIFIC AREA AND SO

00:40:52.383 --> 00:40:52.917
THAT THE BILL ENDED UP BEING

00:40:52.983 --> 00:40:53.884
VETOED --

00:40:53.951 --> 00:40:56.353

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:58.622
TO DO ON ENSURING THAT EVERYONE

00:40:58.689 --> 00:41:00.424

00:41:02.092 --> 00:41:04.328
CONFLICT IS FOR ME THE BEING

00:41:04.395 --> 00:41:06.363

00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:07.832

MAINTAINED ITSELF AS A LEADER IN

00:56:26.082 --> 00:56:27.884

ON WILDLIFE.

00:56:28.985 --> 00:56:30.587

STRONG ON THE ANIMAL SIDE.

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:41.431

AROUND.

00:56:46.503 --> 00:56:48.772
TRAPPING IS HORRENDOUSLY CRUEL

00:56:48.838 --> 00:56:50.306
AS CONSUMERS ARE LEARNING VIA

00:56:50.373 --> 00:56:51.975
SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS SHOWING

00:56:52.041 --> 00:56:54.244
TERRIFIED ANIMALS CROUCHING IN

ESCAPE THEIR IMMINENT FATE.

00:56:58.381 --> 00:57:00.150
TRAPS DO NOT DISCRIMINATE SO IT

00:57:00.216 --> 00:57:02.318

TRAPPERS CALL THESE ANIMALS

00:57:09.859 --> 00:57:12.362
TRASH KILLS BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO

00:57:12.428 --> 00:57:14.464
ECONOMIC VALUE TO THEM.

00:57:14.531 --> 00:57:15.265

METHOD OF KILLING THEM WITHOUT

00:57:31.347 --> 00:57:32.649
DAMAGING THEIR FERVOR IS

00:57:32.715 --> 00:57:33.783
TYPICALLY BY WAY OF

01:12:51.934 --> 01:12:54.069
IT'S DIFFICULT.

01:12:54.136 --> 01:12:54.670
I THINK YOU HEARD SOME OF THE

01:12:54.737 --> 01:12:56.171
CONTENTS.

01:12:56.238 --> 01:12:58.207
THAT THAT ARE GENUINE I THINK

01:12:58.273 --> 01:12:59.541
THERE IS SOME.

01:12:59.608 --> 01:13:01.343
SOME GENUINE IS HERE TO WANTING

01:13:01.410 --> 01:13:02.945
THIS TO SAVE.

01:13:03.011 --> 01:13:04.546
THE BOBCATS THE COYOTES AND

01:13:04.613 --> 01:13:05.948
EVERYTHING BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO

01:13:06.014 --> 01:13:07.416
RECOGNIZE THERE ARE CERTAIN

01:13:07.483 --> 01:13:10.586
FACTS THAT WE CAN'T IGNORE.

01:13:10.652 --> 01:13:12.554
THESE ARE ALSO PREDATORS.

01:13:12.621 --> 01:13:15.557
AND THEY DO FEED ON THE WILDLIFE.

01:13:15.624 --> 01:13:17.159
AND THEY DO FEED.

01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:18.660
ON THE BABY CALVES AND THE BABY

01:13:18.727 --> 01:13:20.963
SHE I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU A

01:13:21.029 --> 01:13:23.065
LITTLE STORY.

01:13:23.132 --> 01:13:25.200
OF A FEW YEARS BACK WHEN.

01:13:25.267 --> 01:13:26.969
MY KIDS WERE IN FOR H. AND

01:13:27.035 --> 01:13:27.936
SHOWING --

01:13:28.003 --> 01:13:29.738
ANIMALS AND THEY HAD.

01:13:29.805 --> 01:13:31.874
MY SON HAD.

01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:33.108
CHEAP THAT WERE BEING SHOWN ALL

01:13:33.175 --> 01:13:34.443
OVER THE COUNTRY [inaudible]

01:13:34.510 --> 01:13:39.715
AND ONE NIGHT.

01:13:39.782 --> 01:13:41.617
AN ATTACK OF COYOTES DECIMATED

01:13:41.683 --> 01:13:44.019
HIS FLOCK.

01:13:44.086 --> 01:13:45.621
I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU JUST WHAT

01:13:45.687 --> 01:13:47.222
OCCURRED ON THAT NIGHT

01:13:47.289 --> 01:13:47.523
[inaudible]

01:13:47.589 --> 01:13:49.424
A FEMALE.

01:13:49.491 --> 01:13:50.559
SINGULARLY.

01:13:50.626 --> 01:13:53.495
CAME IN AND TOOK DOWN.

01:13:53.562 --> 01:13:56.331
NINETEEN DAVEY LAMBS. FIVE

01:13:56.398 --> 01:13:58.801
MOTHER USE.

01:13:58.867 --> 01:14:00.269
WHEN I CAME OUT TO FEED AT SIX

01:14:00.335 --> 01:14:01.637
AM IN THE MORNING?

01:14:01.703 --> 01:14:02.971
I FOUND THE DEAD CARCASSES OF

01:14:03.038 --> 01:14:04.473
MOST.

01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:06.575
MANY OF THOSE BABY LAMBS.

01:14:06.642 --> 01:14:07.643
THEIR ENTIRE FROM THE CENTER

01:14:07.709 --> 01:14:08.977
THEIR SPINE ALL THE WAY DOWN TO

01:14:09.044 --> 01:14:10.045
THEIR SIDE.

01:14:10.112 --> 01:14:12.114
THEIR ENTIRE HIDE WAS DRAGGING

01:14:12.181 --> 01:14:14.817
ON THE GROUND AND ALL YOU COULD

01:14:14.883 --> 01:14:16.485
SEE WHERE THEIR RIBS.

01:14:16.552 --> 01:14:18.020
THE MOTHER IS BALLING FOR THEIR

01:14:18.086 --> 01:14:20.989
BABIES.

01:14:21.056 --> 01:14:23.025
IT WAS VERY SURREAL AND

01:14:23.091 --> 01:14:25.160
DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH.

01:14:25.227 --> 01:14:26.428
BUT BEING SOMEONE WHO LIVES IN

01:14:26.495 --> 01:14:27.629
AG.

01:14:27.696 --> 01:14:29.364
HAD TO DO WHAT HAD TO BE DONE.

01:14:29.431 --> 01:14:32.134
AND NOT EUTHANIZE THOSE ANIMALS

01:14:32.201 --> 01:14:32.434
[inaudible]

01:14:32.501 --> 01:14:35.704
THESE ANIMALS [inaudible]

01:14:35.771 --> 01:14:37.406
WERE UNCHANGED.

01:14:37.472 --> 01:14:39.374
AND WHAT THEY WERE DOING.

01:14:39.441 --> 01:14:41.643
WAS REPRODUCING AT AN ESCALATED

01:14:41.710 --> 01:14:45.214
SEPARATES.

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:47.683
IT'S HARD IF YOU ARE DON'T HAVE

01:14:47.749 --> 01:14:49.151
THE TOOLS AVAILABLE TO YOU. TO

01:14:49.218 --> 01:14:50.652
KEEP THE POPULATION GROWTH IN

01:14:50.719 --> 01:14:52.888
CHECK.

01:14:52.955 --> 01:14:54.289
I DON'T ADVOCATE FOR THE

01:14:54.356 --> 01:14:56.024
ERADICATION OR THE ELIMINATION

01:14:56.091 --> 01:14:56.625
OF ALL.

01:14:56.692 --> 01:14:57.726
BECAUSE EACH HAS THEIR OWN

01:14:57.793 --> 01:14:59.394
PURPOSE IN THE WORLD AS

01:14:59.461 --> 01:15:01.363
PREDATORS TO KEEP OTHER THINGS

01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:02.965
IN CHECK.

01:15:03.031 --> 01:15:03.999
BUT YOU HEARD WHAT WAS HAPPENING

01:15:04.066 --> 01:15:05.234
AROUND THE GREAT LAKES YOU'VE

01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:07.002
HEARD IN OTHER AREAS WE HAVE IT

01:15:07.069 --> 01:15:08.737
IN THIS STATE ARE GREAT YOU

01:15:08.804 --> 01:15:10.105
GRATZ.

01:15:10.172 --> 01:15:11.573
BOTH BLUE AND WHITE.

01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:13.809
COME COMPROMISED AROUND STOCK

01:15:13.876 --> 01:15:15.777
FUNDS WATER PONDS WATERWAYS

01:15:15.844 --> 01:15:17.246
WHERE THEY NEST.

01:15:17.312 --> 01:15:19.348
BY THESE VERY CREATURES THAT

01:15:19.414 --> 01:15:20.949
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:15:21.016 --> 01:15:24.286
AND TAKING AWAY ALL THE TOOLS.

01:15:24.353 --> 01:15:25.554
WILL MAKE IT INCREASINGLY MORE

01:15:25.621 --> 01:15:28.223
DIFFICULT AND COSTLY FOR US AS A

01:15:28.290 --> 01:15:29.558
STATE.

01:15:29.625 --> 01:15:31.360
I THINK THERE HAS TO BE ANOTHER

01:15:31.426 --> 01:15:34.663
WAY. FOR US TO WORK TOGETHER.

01:15:34.730 --> 01:15:37.065
AND SOLVING THIS MAJOR PROBLEM I

01:15:37.132 --> 01:15:38.367
DO UNDERSTAND.

01:15:38.433 --> 01:15:39.001
THE FOR ISSUE.

01:15:39.067 --> 01:15:42.704
THINGS CHANGED.

01:15:42.771 --> 01:15:43.872
BUT THERE HAS TO BE A WAY FOR US

01:15:43.939 --> 01:15:45.374
TO WORK WITHOUT COMPLETELY

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:47.042
BANNING OR TAKING THE TOOL OFF

01:15:47.109 --> 01:15:49.111
THE TABLE I DO APPRECIATE THE

01:15:49.177 --> 01:15:50.579
AUTHORS RECOGNITION.

01:15:50.646 --> 01:15:53.615
OF THE DEPREDATION COMPONENT.

01:15:53.682 --> 01:15:54.650
WITH AN S..

01:15:54.716 --> 01:15:56.685
BUT IT STILL IS GOING TO MAKE IT

01:15:56.752 --> 01:15:58.153
MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE A LOT OF

01:15:58.220 --> 01:15:59.221
THE LANDOWNERS.

01:15:59.288 --> 01:16:01.290
CAN'T GET ACCESS TO THE STATE OR

01:16:01.356 --> 01:16:02.491
FEDERAL TRAPPER.

01:16:02.557 --> 01:16:04.259
PROGRAMS AND THAT'S GOING TO

01:16:04.326 --> 01:16:05.761
MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE

01:16:05.827 --> 01:16:06.662
RIGHT NOW.

01:16:06.728 --> 01:16:08.730
FISH AND WILDLIFE DOESN'T HAVE

01:16:08.797 --> 01:16:10.666
ENOUGH TRAPPERS LEFT IN THE

01:16:10.732 --> 01:16:13.001
STATE TO GO OUT AND DO THE JOB

01:16:13.068 --> 01:16:15.304
FOR EXAMPLE A TRAPPER THAT I USE.

01:16:15.370 --> 01:16:16.305
IT'S COMING FROM MENDOCINO

01:16:16.371 --> 01:16:17.806
COUNTY AND HE'S ONLY THERE ON

01:16:17.873 --> 01:16:18.941
CERTAIN DAYS.

01:16:19.007 --> 01:16:20.442
SO IF IT'S MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE

01:16:20.509 --> 01:16:21.877
FOR ME TO LIVE WITH SOMEBODY WHO

01:16:21.944 --> 01:16:23.245
CAN'T CHECK THEIR TRAPS EVERYDAY

01:16:23.312 --> 01:16:25.347
AND HUMANELY ADJUST. FOR WHAT'S

01:16:25.414 --> 01:16:26.882
OCCURRING.

01:16:26.949 --> 01:16:29.318
SO I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK

01:16:29.384 --> 01:16:30.852
AT THIS.

01:16:30.919 --> 01:16:32.955
MAYBE A LITTLE BROADER.

01:16:33.021 --> 01:16:34.856
AND MAYBE WORK ON IT SO MAYBE.

01:16:34.923 --> 01:16:36.825
AGAIN I'M NOT FOR LIKE A

01:16:36.892 --> 01:16:37.859
DIFFERENT HERE AND THERE.

01:16:37.926 --> 01:16:39.428
WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON THIS

01:16:39.494 --> 01:16:40.762
BECAUSE WE DO GET ALONG.

01:16:40.829 --> 01:16:42.664
AND TRY TO FIND A WAY THAT WE

01:16:42.731 --> 01:16:44.099
CAN RESOLVE THIS.

01:16:44.166 --> 01:16:45.834
BOTH FOR THE FARMERS AND

01:16:45.901 --> 01:16:47.336
RANCHERS.

01:16:47.402 --> 01:16:48.937
AND THE PEOPLE ARE IN THE

01:16:49.004 --> 01:16:50.005
INDUSTRY BECAUSE SOME OF THOSE

01:16:50.072 --> 01:16:51.740
FOLKS.

01:16:51.807 --> 01:16:53.308
I'M GONNA RECOGNIZE ARE BAD

01:16:53.375 --> 01:16:55.010
ACTORS AND WE NEED [inaudible]

01:16:55.077 --> 01:16:56.912
TO PURGE THAT.

01:16:56.979 --> 01:16:57.879
BUT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE ARE

01:16:57.946 --> 01:16:59.581
VERY HUMANE AND DO THESE THINGS

01:16:59.648 --> 01:17:00.515
AND THE RIGHTEOUS WAYS.

01:17:00.582 --> 01:17:02.517
WE NEED TO USE ALL THE TOOLS

01:17:02.584 --> 01:17:04.152
AVAILABLE TO US. FOR THE

01:17:04.219 --> 01:17:06.955
ENVIRONMENT FOR THE ANIMALS AND

01:17:07.022 --> 01:17:07.589
AND FOR THE ACTIONS THAT WE HAVE

01:17:07.656 --> 01:17:08.557
TO SAY.

01:17:08.623 --> 01:17:09.858
SO I WANT TO BE CLEAR I THANK

01:17:09.925 --> 01:17:11.293
YOU AND I'D BE HAPPY TO WORK

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:12.427
WITH YOU WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT

01:17:12.494 --> 01:17:13.829
THIS IS --

01:17:13.895 --> 01:17:15.597
THE BANNING OF FOR FOR

01:17:15.664 --> 01:17:16.498
COMMERCIAL --

01:17:16.565 --> 01:17:18.266
USING RECREATIONAL AND DOES NOT

01:17:18.333 --> 01:17:19.735
STOP OBVIOUSLY YOU IS A LAND

01:17:19.801 --> 01:17:21.136
OPENER YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO

01:17:21.203 --> 01:17:22.604
HAVE A TRAPPING PERMIT TO TO

01:17:22.671 --> 01:17:23.839
PROTECT YOUR OWN PROPERTY ON

01:17:23.905 --> 01:17:24.973
YOUR LAND --

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:27.976
AND AND SO I KNOW I KNOW RIGHT

01:17:28.043 --> 01:17:30.312
NOW I UNDERSTAND THE ARGUMENT IS --

01:17:30.379 --> 01:17:32.014
ALLOWING PEOPLE ON YOUR LAND TO

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:33.515
TO DO IT FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES

01:17:33.582 --> 01:17:34.616
SOMETIMES ALLOWS YOU TO ALSO

01:17:34.683 --> 01:17:36.251
PROTECT YOUR PROPERTY BUT THAT

01:17:36.318 --> 01:17:37.953
IS ALSO THE STATE SUBSIDIZING

01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:41.723
THEN -- THIS

01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:43.658
CONTROL KIND OF SITUATION AND I

01:17:43.725 --> 01:17:44.793
THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THOSE

01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:46.328
WHO ARE BENEFITING FROM THAT TO

01:17:46.395 --> 01:17:48.296
PAY FOR NOT FOR THE STATE --

01:17:48.363 --> 01:17:49.865
BASICALLY WILDLIFE.

01:17:49.931 --> 01:17:51.466
FUND TO BE TO BE PAYING FOR

01:17:51.533 --> 01:17:53.001
RIGHT AND THAT THAT THAT'S WHERE

01:17:53.068 --> 01:17:54.669
WE REALLY NEED WE CAN TALK MORE

01:17:54.736 --> 01:17:55.937
ON THAT WE CAN WORK DEFINITELY

01:17:56.004 --> 01:17:58.206
APPROPRIATIONS HM I I GET THAT

01:17:58.273 --> 01:18:01.109
PART ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE.

01:18:01.176 --> 01:18:03.278
BUT WHAT I WOULD ALSO RECOGNIZE

01:18:03.345 --> 01:18:05.280
IT AS THESE CREATURES ARE GIVING

01:18:05.347 --> 01:18:09.518
THEIR LIVES MAYBE WE CAN USE.

01:18:09.584 --> 01:18:10.919
IN SOME WAY.

01:18:10.986 --> 01:18:13.055
THE VALUE.

01:18:13.121 --> 01:18:15.223
OF THAT LIFE BEING GIVEN.

01:18:15.290 --> 01:18:17.259
EVERYTHING HAS A SANCTITY.

01:18:17.325 --> 01:18:18.860
I'VE I AGREED.

01:18:18.927 --> 01:18:20.562
I RECOGNIZE THAT SOME PEOPLE

01:18:20.629 --> 01:18:21.997
DON'T ALWAYS AGREE WITH THAT.

01:18:22.064 --> 01:18:23.098
BUT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY

01:18:23.165 --> 01:18:24.499
TO WORK WITH.

01:18:24.566 --> 01:18:26.268
ALL OF THE PARTS WE DON'T JUST

01:18:26.334 --> 01:18:28.170
TRASH EVERYTHING.

01:18:28.236 --> 01:18:29.571
THANK YOU.

01:18:29.638 --> 01:18:30.772
WE HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION FROM

PREVENT THE SAME PERSON TO ADD

01:20:10.372 --> 01:20:13.041
MAKE MONEY BEING A PEST CONTROL.

01:20:13.108 --> 01:20:14.776
TRAPPER IN YOUR AREA THEY COULD

01:20:14.843 --> 01:20:16.344
HAVE A DIFFERENT LICENSE SO YOU

NECESSARILY MAYBE CREATES A NEW

01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:20.849
MARKET FOR FOR NEW JOBS --

01:20:20.916 --> 01:20:22.250
THAT ARE IN LINE AND AND ARE

01:20:22.317 --> 01:20:24.052
LESS LIKELY TO HAVE THINGS LIKE

01:20:24.119 --> 01:20:25.954
INCIDENTAL TAKEN YOU KNOW.

01:20:26.021 --> 01:20:27.722

FOR TRAPPING FOR RECREATION XIN

01:20:31.193 --> 01:20:33.128
FOR PROTECTION OF PUBLIC --

01:20:33.195 --> 01:20:35.330
INFRASTRUCTURE SO FOR EXAMPLE.

01:20:35.397 --> 01:20:37.132
IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE HAVE

01:20:37.199 --> 01:20:39.401
THE NUTRIA RAT THAT IS THE NEW

01:20:39.467 --> 01:20:40.035
TALK ABOUT A LOT OF THAT A LOT

01:20:40.101 --> 01:20:41.069
RIGHT.

01:20:41.136 --> 01:20:43.138
IT'S AN INVASIVE SPECIES RIGHT

01:20:43.205 --> 01:20:44.739
SO WOULD WE BE ABLE TO TRAP AND

01:20:44.806 --> 01:20:46.608
I MEAN AND ULTIMATELY IN MANY

01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:48.810
CASES KILL THAT ANIMAL I

01:20:48.877 --> 01:20:49.778
UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S PART

01:20:49.844 --> 01:20:51.513
WHILE LIKE MANAGEMENT THAT'S NOT

01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:52.314
PREVENTED IN THIS BILL

01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:52.614
[inaudible]

01:20:52.681 --> 01:20:54.316
OKAY.

01:20:54.382 --> 01:20:56.017
YOU CAN'T THEN GO SELL THE FOR

01:20:56.084 --> 01:20:57.085
OF THE NUTRIA I DON'T THINK

01:20:57.152 --> 01:20:58.920
THERE'S A MARKET FOR IT ALL

01:20:58.987 --> 01:20:59.788
RIGHT YOU KNOW.

01:20:59.854 --> 01:21:01.289
THAT THAT'S WHAT THIS PREVENTS

01:21:01.356 --> 01:21:03.391
BUT I MEAN MAYBE THERE'S MARKET

01:21:03.458 --> 01:21:04.693
SOMEWHERE THAT CAN BE CONSIDERED

01:21:04.759 --> 01:21:05.794
RECREATION.

01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:06.861
THAT'S NOT RECREATIONAL THAT'S

01:21:06.928 --> 01:21:08.263
WILDLIFE PROTECTION PROPERTY

01:21:08.330 --> 01:21:09.664
PROTECTION ALL THESE THINGS HAVE

01:21:09.731 --> 01:21:11.866

SPACE OF PROTECTING WHAT LATEST

01:21:17.539 --> 01:21:18.873
WOULD YOU SPEAK TO THAT.

01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:20.108
WELL JUST TO CLARIFY WE ARE NOT

01:21:20.175 --> 01:21:22.577
COVERED UNDER THE AGRICULTURE OR

01:21:22.644 --> 01:21:24.779
PRIVATE PROPERTY.

01:21:24.846 --> 01:21:26.781
EXEMPTION IN ALL CASES --

01:21:26.848 --> 01:21:28.450
AND THEN WHEN WE HAVE TO DEAL

01:21:28.516 --> 01:21:30.051
WITH PREDATORS OF WILDLIFE YOU

01:21:30.118 --> 01:21:32.687
KNOW THAT IS A WHOLE SEPARATE

01:21:32.754 --> 01:21:33.455
ISSUE.

01:21:33.521 --> 01:21:34.756
BY YOU THEN TAKING TOOLS THAT WE

01:21:34.823 --> 01:21:36.858
HAVE BEEN USING THESE LOCAL

01:21:36.925 --> 01:21:38.393
TRAPPERS TO TRAP.

01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:39.961
EITHER FOR THE FOR OR

01:21:40.028 --> 01:21:42.097
RECREATIONALLY TAKE THAT TO AWAY

01:21:42.163 --> 01:21:44.165
FROM US THEN IT'S GONNA BE

01:21:44.232 --> 01:21:45.667
HARDER FOR US THAN.

01:21:45.734 --> 01:21:46.568
TO ACCOMPLISH OUR WILDLIFE

01:21:46.635 --> 01:21:48.169
MANAGEMENT GOALS AND SO THAT'S

01:21:48.236 --> 01:21:49.871
THE ISSUE FOR US SURE I I THINK

01:21:49.938 --> 01:21:51.339
YOU NEED TO ADDRESS TO THE

01:21:51.406 --> 01:21:53.074

01:21:53.141 --> 01:21:56.811
THAT THAT OFFER IS AN OUTLINE IT

01:21:56.878 --> 01:21:58.280
SO I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THAT

01:21:58.346 --> 01:21:59.314
NOTHING IN THIS BILL.

01:21:59.381 --> 01:22:00.915
PREVENTS THAT FROM HAPPENING WE

01:22:00.982 --> 01:22:02.117
CAN HAVE A SEPARATE AND FULLER

01:22:02.183 --> 01:22:03.585
DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT THE WHAT

01:22:03.652 --> 01:22:05.420
THE COST BECOMES AND THEN IT'S

01:22:05.487 --> 01:22:06.955
REALLY JUST A TRANSFER COSTS IN

01:22:07.022 --> 01:22:08.156
AND NOT SOMETHING I THINK IT'S

01:22:08.223 --> 01:22:09.324
AN APPROPRIATE DISCUSSION AS AS

01:22:09.391 --> 01:22:10.725
TERM VICE CHAIR PREPARATIONS WE

01:22:10.792 --> 01:22:11.359
CAN HAVE IT.

01:22:11.426 --> 01:22:12.494
IS WHERE'S THE COST BECAUSE

01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:13.561
RIGHT NOW WE'RE SUBSIDIZING

01:22:13.628 --> 01:22:16.197
THESE THESE PERMITS AND SO.

01:22:16.264 --> 01:22:18.333
AT I UNDERSTAND THIS BILL DOES

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:19.734
NOT OUTLAW.

01:22:19.801 --> 01:22:21.036
AT THAT THAT TAKING THAT

01:22:21.102 --> 01:22:23.505
TRAPPING OF OF INVASIVE SPECIES

01:22:23.571 --> 01:22:24.673
WHAT ABOUT THE PUBLIC HAVE

THIS I I'LL TO SOMEONE I MEAN I

01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:32.881
I THINK WITH THIS HIGHLIGHTS IS

01:22:32.947 --> 01:22:34.516
THAT THERE ARE STILL ISSUES AND

01:22:34.582 --> 01:22:35.517
I APPRECIATE YOUR SAYING HEY

01:22:35.583 --> 01:22:37.752
LOOK WE BEEN OBVIOUSLY MYSELF

01:22:37.819 --> 01:22:38.386
THE MEASURE BIGELOW I THINK IT

01:22:38.453 --> 01:22:40.355
WORK ON COMING FROM A RURAL AREA

01:22:40.422 --> 01:22:42.123
UNDERSTANDING THE AGRICULTURAL.

01:22:42.190 --> 01:22:43.758
IMPACTS AND YOU KNOW FOR THE

01:22:43.825 --> 01:22:45.694
WILD AND HABITAT THAT IS IN A

01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:47.829
LOT OF OUR DISTRICTS --

01:22:47.896 --> 01:22:50.198
WOULD APPRECIATE WORKING THROUGH

01:22:50.265 --> 01:22:51.132
SOME OF THESE ISSUES I THINK ARE

01:22:51.199 --> 01:22:53.268
A ARE POTENTIAL CONFLICT AND

01:22:53.335 --> 01:22:54.469
MAKING HARDER.

01:22:54.536 --> 01:22:57.906
SOMETIMES DOES MAKE IT ALMOST

01:22:57.972 --> 01:22:59.007
IMPOSSIBLE RAY AND THAT'S I

01:22:59.074 --> 01:23:00.141
THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE CONCERNS

01:23:00.208 --> 01:23:01.576
IS THAT IF WE'RE NOT ABLE TO

01:23:01.643 --> 01:23:03.878
CARRY OUT WHAT OUR ROUTINE.

01:23:03.945 --> 01:23:05.480
PROTECTION YOU KNOW PART OF THE

01:23:05.547 --> 01:23:06.915
ROUTINE AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES

ON MANY.

FARMS AND RANCHES THROUGHOUT THE

01:23:09.317 --> 01:23:10.719
STATE THAT COULD BE PROBLEMATIC

01:23:10.785 --> 01:23:11.953
SO THAT'S JUST THAT'S WHERE I'M

01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:13.221
COMING FROM AND I CAN'T SUPPORT

01:23:13.288 --> 01:23:14.622

01:56:09.295 --> 01:56:10.897
IN GENDER OUGHT OF EMOTION --

01:56:10.963 --> 01:56:12.532
BUT I FOR ME THIS IS SIMPLY A

01:56:12.598 --> 01:56:14.334
QUESTION OF DOING RIGHT OR WRONG --

01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:14.901
I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE

01:56:14.967 --> 01:56:16.035
ALTERNATIVES --

01:56:16.102 --> 01:56:18.004
THAT WORK A DIMENSION OF

01:56:18.071 --> 01:56:19.706
OPPORTUNITY OF REGIME --

01:56:19.772 --> 01:56:20.340

CALIFORNIA WANTS TO DO WE WANT

AND BY LEADING THAT IS BY

01:56:24.377 --> 01:56:27.146
BANNING THIS BUT THE HUMANE --

01:56:27.213 --> 01:56:28.781
AND NOT AND NOT WITH A TWENTY

01:56:28.848 --> 01:56:30.283

[inaudible]

01:56:37.390 --> 01:56:38.257
TO BIGELOW [inaudible]

THANK.

01:56:39.459 --> 01:56:40.727
THANK YOU MISS FRIEDMAN I

01:56:40.793 --> 01:56:43.162
APPRECIATE YOUR GOAL HERE TO TRY

01:56:43.229 --> 01:56:45.631
TO BE HUMANE AND ADDRESS THOSE

01:56:45.698 --> 01:56:47.633
CONCERNS THAT YOU'VE RAISED HERE --

01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:49.769
THERE ARE SOME ALTERNATIVES AND

01:56:49.836 --> 01:56:51.871
SOME INDUSTRY STANDARDS THAT ARE.

01:56:51.938 --> 01:56:52.672
CHANGING AND I THINK WE HEARD

01:56:52.739 --> 01:56:53.339
THEM.

01:56:53.406 --> 01:56:55.141
ARE YOU GONNA BE ABLE TO WORK

01:56:55.208 --> 01:56:57.944
WITH SOME OF THOSE --

01:56:58.010 --> 01:56:59.412
IDEAS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED

01:56:59.479 --> 01:57:01.581
HERE LISTEN TO ON AND AND SEE

01:57:01.647 --> 01:57:03.783
HOW THEY CAN BE INCORPORATED.

01:57:03.850 --> 01:57:04.417
THAT WOULD BE MY FIRST QUESTION

01:57:04.484 --> 01:57:05.385
TO YOU.

01:57:05.451 --> 01:57:06.319
I DON'T COMPOUND QUESTION HERE

01:57:06.386 --> 01:57:07.620
ALL I WOULD JUST SAY THAT I

01:57:07.687 --> 01:57:09.355
THINK THAT THAT'S AN ADMIRABLE

01:57:09.422 --> 01:57:10.690
CERTAINLY BUT THERE ARE

01:57:10.757 --> 01:57:11.991
THOUSANDS IN PROBABLY HUNDREDS

01:57:12.058 --> 01:57:13.426
OF THOUSANDS OF FOR OPERATIONS

01:57:13.493 --> 01:57:14.794
ALL AROUND THE WORLD.

01:57:14.861 --> 01:57:16.696
AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SOAR

01:57:16.763 --> 01:57:18.498
FAT SOURCE ANY PRODUCT.

01:57:18.564 --> 01:57:19.966
AND TO SAY THAT IF WE SET THE

01:57:20.032 --> 01:57:21.234
STANDARD THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN

01:57:21.300 --> 01:57:22.201
EVERY SINGLE FOR THAT SOLD IN

01:57:22.268 --> 01:57:24.237
CALIFORNIA WOULD BE HUMANELY

01:57:24.303 --> 01:57:25.705
SOURCED --

01:57:25.772 --> 01:57:26.973
YOU COULD NEVER SAY THAT WITH

01:57:27.039 --> 01:57:28.307
THE AMOUNT OF GARMENTS THAT COME

01:57:28.374 --> 01:57:29.609
INTO THE STATE SO THERE BE

01:57:29.675 --> 01:57:31.210
REALLY NO WAY FOR RETAILERS TO

01:57:31.277 --> 01:57:31.811
KNOW IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO

01:57:31.878 --> 01:57:33.212
SOURCES IT IS WE'VE HEARD

01:57:33.279 --> 01:57:35.882
REPORTS OF RETAILERS --

01:57:35.948 --> 01:57:36.516
A YOU KNOW OFTEN OF REACH EVEN

01:57:36.582 --> 01:57:38.918
MAJOR REACH IN THE MORE OTHER

01:57:38.985 --> 01:57:40.520
PRODUCTS SO THIS THE REALLY THE

01:57:40.586 --> 01:57:41.854
IF YOU CARE ABOUT THE COMPASSION

01:57:41.921 --> 01:57:43.089
YOU JUST HAVE TO SAY.

01:57:43.156 --> 01:57:45.124
WE'RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW THIS

01:57:45.191 --> 01:57:46.192
PRODUCT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT

01:57:46.259 --> 01:57:47.326
AROUND THE WORLD THERE ARE SO

01:57:47.393 --> 01:57:48.961
MANY IN HUMANE PRACTICES AND YOU

01:57:49.028 --> 01:57:49.862
REALLY SOME OF THE ONES THAT

01:57:49.929 --> 01:57:51.030
WERE CITED HERE.

01:57:51.097 --> 01:57:51.964
ARE PROBABLY SOME OF THE BEST

01:57:52.031 --> 01:57:53.166
DOCTORS BUT YOU KNOW THERE ARE A

01:57:53.232 --> 01:57:54.033
LOT OF COUNTRIES WHERE THERE'S

01:57:54.100 --> 01:57:55.735
NO STANDARDS AT ALL FOR HOW

01:57:55.802 --> 01:57:56.636
ANIMALS ARE RAISED AND

01:57:56.702 --> 01:57:57.703
SLAUGHTERED IN A LOT OF THOSE

01:57:57.770 --> 01:58:00.006
END UP IN THE CALIFORNIA MARKET.

01:58:00.072 --> 01:58:01.340
SO THAT WOULD BE MY RESPONSE TO

01:58:01.407 --> 01:58:02.742
THAT SO GIVEN THAT SAID THAT

01:58:02.809 --> 01:58:04.076
OPENS THE DOOR SINCE WE CAN'T

01:58:04.143 --> 01:58:05.711
REGULATE THE WORLD WE CAN'T

01:58:05.778 --> 01:58:06.412
REGULATE OUTSIDE OUR OWN

01:58:06.479 --> 01:58:07.513
BOUNDARIES.

01:58:07.580 --> 01:58:09.415
BUT WE CAN REGULATE WITH DAN SO

01:58:09.482 --> 01:58:11.184
LOOKING AT THE LOGIC THAT MAYBE

THE STATE LICENSED --

01:59:36.669 --> 01:59:38.871
TAG PER TAKE UNIT YEAH THAT'S

01:59:38.938 --> 01:59:40.172
THE FIRST AMENDMENT THAT THE

01:59:40.239 --> 01:59:42.375

DEALING WITH LICENSE TIME TO

THAT WAS THE FIRST AMENDMENT

01:59:50.449 --> 01:59:51.851
FROM THE COMMITTEE OKAY WELL AS

01:59:51.918 --> 01:59:52.952
LONG AS YOU HAVE A A HUNTING

01:59:53.019 --> 01:59:54.654
LICENCES LONG AS IT WAS TAKEN

01:59:54.720 --> 01:59:55.221

CALIFORNIA HUNTING LICENCES

01:59:56.622 --> 01:59:58.691
THINK THERE WAS SOME CONFUSION

01:59:58.758 --> 01:59:59.659
ON WHETHER THAT.

01:59:59.725 --> 02:00:00.459
YEAH THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE

02:00:00.526 --> 02:00:01.460
LANGUAGE RIGHT NOW BUT THAT WAS

02:00:01.527 --> 02:00:02.461
CERTAINLY THE INTENT OF THE

02:00:10.169 --> 02:00:11.904
HUNTING LICENSE OR IF IT'S AN

02:00:11.971 --> 02:00:13.072
ANIMAL THAT IS BEING.

IN CALIFORNIA --

02:00:16.609 --> 02:00:18.077
THE AND WE HAD A LOT OF

02:00:18.144 --> 02:00:18.678
DISCUSSION WE ACTUALLY DIDN'T

02:00:18.744 --> 02:00:19.979
THINK ABOUT GROWTH SO I WAS GLAD

02:00:20.046 --> 02:00:21.113
THAT IT WAS BROUGHT UP BY MR

WITH THE REASON THAT THE THAT WE

02:00:25.451 --> 02:00:26.619
DIDN'T ALLOW ALL RABBIT IS

02:00:26.686 --> 02:00:27.954

REYES JUST FOR FOR AND YOU KNOW

02:00:29.488 --> 02:00:30.590
IN A LOT OF PLACES BUT FOR THE

02:00:30.656 --> 02:00:32.258
ANIMALS THAT ARE RAISED.

02:00:32.325 --> 02:00:33.759
FOR ME I DO BELIEVE THAT THEY

02:00:33.826 --> 02:00:34.860

02:01:26.412 --> 02:01:27.713
OF CONSCIOUSNESS --

02:01:27.780 --> 02:01:30.016
OF HOW OUR ACTIONS.

02:01:30.082 --> 02:01:31.350
HAVE IMPACTS OF WEATHER STOCK MY

02:01:31.417 --> 02:01:33.452
GLOBAL WARMING WHAT HAVE YOU OR

02:01:33.519 --> 02:01:36.022

02:01:36.088 --> 02:01:38.591

PART OF THAT MOVEMENT --

02:01:44.130 --> 02:01:45.531
OF CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THAT WE'RE

02:01:45.598 --> 02:01:47.233
REALIZING THAT.

02:01:47.299 --> 02:01:48.634
WE HAVE CHOICES AND OUR CHOICES

02:01:48.701 --> 02:01:50.202
HAVE AN IMPACT.

02:01:50.269 --> 02:01:51.337
AND YOU KNOW BUT THERE'S

02:01:51.404 --> 02:01:53.072
PROHIBITS FASHION VERSES FOR OR

02:01:53.139 --> 02:01:54.473
FIRST PERSONAL PREFERENCE VERSUS

02:01:54.540 --> 02:01:57.410
THE PAIN CAUSED BY THE CHOICES.

02:01:57.476 --> 02:02:00.379
THAT PEOPLE MAKE BUT I THINK THE

02:02:00.446 --> 02:02:02.048
THE STATE DOES HAVE A ROLE --

02:02:02.114 --> 02:02:04.016
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S NOT

02:02:04.083 --> 02:02:07.186
SOMETHING THAT IS NECESSARY. FOR

02:02:07.253 --> 02:02:08.454
US.

02:02:08.521 --> 02:02:09.655
TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT OURSELVES

02:02:09.722 --> 02:02:10.823
OUR FAMILIES --

02:02:10.890 --> 02:02:14.694
AND IF IT'S JUST A KIND OF AND I

02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:16.062
I LIKE THAT THERE'S A HASHTAG

02:02:16.128 --> 02:02:17.396
THAT WAS ALREADY MADE.

02:02:17.463 --> 02:02:20.733
MAKE COMPASSION THE FASHION

02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:24.003
SOMEONE SAID SOME OF THE VERY

02:02:24.070 --> 02:02:25.871
THAT I'VE ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED.

02:02:25.938 --> 02:02:28.708
BUT REALLY JUST FASHION I THINK

02:02:28.774 --> 02:02:30.242
YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN THE FASHION

02:02:30.309 --> 02:02:31.410
TRENDS MOVING IN A POSITIVE

02:02:31.477 --> 02:02:32.611
DIRECTION.

02:02:32.678 --> 02:02:34.413
AND I THINK THAT THE THE THE

02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:36.048
TIMING IS GREAT FOR CALIFORNIA

02:02:36.115 --> 02:02:37.383
TAKE THE LEAD ON THIS AND I

02:02:37.450 --> 02:02:39.185
THINK IT WILL HELP TO LEAD THE

02:02:39.251 --> 02:02:41.987
REST OF THE NATION AND I

02:02:42.054 --> 02:02:43.355
CERTAINLY APPLAUD THE INDUSTRY

02:02:43.422 --> 02:02:45.124
BECAUSE YOU KNOW AGAIN THIS IS

02:02:45.191 --> 02:02:46.358
JUST ONE STATE.

02:02:46.425 --> 02:02:48.094
OF UPPERS SOLD AROUND THE WORLD

02:02:48.160 --> 02:02:48.728
IF THE INDUSTRY IS GOING TO DO

02:02:48.794 --> 02:02:49.895
THINGS -- TO

02:02:49.962 --> 02:02:52.431
IMPROVE THEIR PRACTICES THAT'S

02:02:52.498 --> 02:02:53.432
THAT'S TO BE APPLAUDED AND WE

02:02:53.499 --> 02:02:53.699
GOT THEM.

02:02:53.766 --> 02:02:55.067
IN OF OTHER CERTAINLY DISCOURAGE

02:02:55.134 --> 02:02:56.335
THAT BUT I THINK.

02:02:56.402 --> 02:02:57.870
THIS IS AN ISSUE WHERE IT'S IT'S

02:02:57.937 --> 02:03:00.139
PRETTY BLACK AND WHITE AS TO

02:03:00.206 --> 02:03:01.974
WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND I THINK

02:03:02.041 --> 02:03:03.442
THIS IS A TIME FOR US. TO MAKE

02:03:03.509 --> 02:03:04.744
IT VERY CLEAR.

02:03:04.810 --> 02:03:06.946
THAT FOR IS NOT NECESSARY AND

02:03:07.012 --> 02:03:08.614
THAT WE DON'T NEED TO HARM

02:03:08.681 --> 02:03:11.350
ANIMALS IN ORDER TO EITHER.

02:03:11.417 --> 02:03:13.486
CLOSE OURSELVES INTO AUTO.

02:03:13.552 --> 02:03:16.122

WHERE WHERE WE ARE TODAY AND AND

02:03:32.071 --> 02:03:33.172

NATIVE AMERICANS WHO STILL

AROUND TO SEVERAL COMMITTEES

02:05:10.669 --> 02:05:11.737
THIS MORNING --

02:05:11.804 --> 02:05:13.505
MAY WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT

02:05:13.572 --> 02:05:15.808
COMMITTEE SCHEDULING --

02:05:15.875 --> 02:05:17.643
BUT YOU KNOW.

02:05:17.710 --> 02:05:18.644
AND WE KIND OF GOT IN THIS IN

02:05:18.711 --> 02:05:22.748
THEAND IN THE PREVIOUS BILL --

02:05:22.815 --> 02:05:24.316
LOOK I JUST THINK THE BETTER WAY

02:05:24.383 --> 02:05:26.252
TO DEAL WITH THIS IN A DEMOCRACY

02:05:26.318 --> 02:05:30.122
AND IN A FREE MARKET ECONOMY IS

02:05:30.189 --> 02:05:32.191
THAT CONSUMERS YOU KNOW CAN

02:05:32.258 --> 02:05:34.727
DEMAND THAT PRACTICES CHANGE BY

02:05:34.793 --> 02:05:36.395
THE BY THE WAY THEY ACT.

02:05:36.462 --> 02:05:37.329
AND BY THE PRODUCTS THAT THEY

02:05:37.396 --> 02:05:38.731
DECIDE TO PURCHASE OR NOT

02:05:38.797 --> 02:05:39.732
PURCHASE.

02:05:39.798 --> 02:05:41.600
AND IN THIS FEAR THAT'S ALREADY

02:05:41.667 --> 02:05:43.402
HAPPENING YOU KNOW AS AS A

02:05:43.469 --> 02:05:45.137
MEMBER KALRA POINTED OUT.

02:05:45.204 --> 02:05:46.739
WHICH AGAIN BRINGS YOU BACK TO

02:05:46.805 --> 02:05:48.340
WHAT'S THE POINT OF THIS BILL.

02:05:48.407 --> 02:05:49.608
I DON'T THINK IT'S REALLY OUR

02:05:49.675 --> 02:05:51.744
ROLE TO DECIDE WHO NEEDS FOR AND

02:05:51.810 --> 02:05:53.078
WHO DOESN'T.

02:05:53.145 --> 02:05:54.680
AND TO MAKE THOSE KIND OF

02:05:54.747 --> 02:05:55.714
JUDGMENTS.

02:05:55.781 --> 02:05:57.583
JUST BECAUSE YOU PERHAPS THINK

02:05:57.650 --> 02:05:58.851
THAT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A MORAL

02:05:58.918 --> 02:06:00.185
OBJECTION TO IT.

02:06:00.252 --> 02:06:02.087
DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU KNOW

02:06:02.154 --> 02:06:03.689
EVERYBODY IN SOCIETY SHOULD.

02:06:03.756 --> 02:06:04.990
OR THAT WE SHOULD USE THE POWER

02:06:05.057 --> 02:06:07.393
OF GOVERNMENT TO ENFORCE THAT

02:06:07.459 --> 02:06:09.361
IMPOSE THAT ON EVERYBODY ELSE --

02:06:09.428 --> 02:06:11.897
CAN ACT.

02:06:11.964 --> 02:06:13.565
IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY WITH

02:06:13.632 --> 02:06:14.767
THEIR FEET AND WITH THEIR

02:06:14.833 --> 02:06:16.068
PURCHASES.

02:06:16.135 --> 02:06:17.403
AND SO I MEAN I THINK THAT'S

02:06:17.469 --> 02:06:18.637
WHAT THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE HERE

02:06:18.704 --> 02:06:20.839
IS AND THE ARGUMENT THAT WE JUST

02:06:20.906 --> 02:06:22.741
WELL WE DON'T REALLY NEED FOR

02:06:22.808 --> 02:06:25.010
ANYMORE OR ON THE SHOULDN'T YOU

02:06:25.077 --> 02:06:25.911
KNOW YOU SHOULDN'T DO THIS AND

02:06:25.978 --> 02:06:28.514
THAT IN THIS CONTEXT CAN EASILY

02:06:28.580 --> 02:06:30.282
BE APPLIED.

02:06:30.349 --> 02:06:32.418
TO IT VERY EASILY THE SAME EXACT

02:06:32.484 --> 02:06:34.453
LINE OF ARGUMENT BEEF A LINE TO

02:06:34.520 --> 02:06:35.688
SAY HEY WE SHOULDN'T.

02:06:35.754 --> 02:06:39.291
RAISE CATTLE. FOR FOOD.

02:06:39.358 --> 02:06:41.026
YOU KNOW THAT THAT WE SHOULDN'T.

02:06:41.093 --> 02:06:42.061
YOU KNOW I MEAN EVERY EVERY YEAR

02:06:42.127 --> 02:06:44.863
I BUY A HARVESTER RICE CROP.

02:06:44.930 --> 02:06:45.931
I KILL A PLANT IN ORDER TO

02:06:45.998 --> 02:06:47.866
PROVIDE THAT RICE THAT FEEDS

02:06:47.933 --> 02:06:50.135
PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

02:06:50.202 --> 02:06:52.204
IF WE'RE GONNA ARGUE THAT HEY

02:06:52.271 --> 02:06:53.872
YOU SHOULDN'T KILL LIVING THING.

02:06:53.939 --> 02:06:56.041
YOUR PLANTS ARE ARE ALSO LIVING

02:06:56.108 --> 02:06:57.142
NEAR DISS.

SO I MEAN.

02:06:57.609 --> 02:07:01.013
THE WHOLE CAN GO TO A CRAZY

02:07:01.080 --> 02:07:02.881
CONCLUSION.

02:07:02.948 --> 02:07:04.850
ESSENTIALLY AND SO YOU KNOW IF

02:07:04.917 --> 02:07:06.785
IT'S NOT OKAY IN THIS CONTEXT

02:07:06.852 --> 02:07:08.454
AGAIN LET'S ALLOW THE FREE

02:07:08.520 --> 02:07:10.589
MARKET TO DECIDE WHAT PRODUCTS

02:07:10.656 --> 02:07:11.890
PEOPLE WANT AND WHAT WHAT

02:07:11.957 --> 02:07:13.225
MARKETS ARE ACTUALLY

02:07:13.292 --> 02:07:15.561
COMMERCIALLY VIABLE.

02:07:15.627 --> 02:07:17.830
AND NOT DO SO BY.

02:07:17.896 --> 02:07:18.197
OF THE AUDIENCE.

RIGHT I MEAN IS THIS IS YOU KNOW.

I THINK THIS IS A A LEGITIMATE

02:07:29.775 --> 02:07:30.943
PRACTICE I DON'T THINK THERE'S

02:07:31.010 --> 02:07:32.911
ANY MORAL OBJECTION TO THOSE WHO

02:07:32.978 --> 02:07:37.216

WHERE YOU COME FROM YOU KNOW AND

IN YOUR IN YOUR OWN DEMOCRATIC

02:08:39.711 --> 02:08:40.979
WAY OF DOING THAT WE DON'T NEED

PEOPLE VIEW THE WORLD LITTLE BIT

02:09:10.409 --> 02:09:11.777
DIFFERENTLY.

02:09:11.844 --> 02:09:12.845
THEN YOU ND MAYBE PEOPLE ARE

02:09:12.911 --> 02:09:14.179

AND WE SHOULDN'T GO DOWN THIS

02:09:23.889 --> 02:09:25.390
ROAD --

02:09:25.457 --> 02:09:26.725
BECAUSE TOMORROW MIGHT BE

02:09:26.792 --> 02:09:28.160
SOMETHING ELSE IT THAT YOU

OR LIVES MATTERS SO --

02:11:22.674 --> 02:11:27.012
BUT THE SOME ANIMALS.

THAT WE CONSUME US SUCH AS A

02:11:29.181 --> 02:11:31.216
LAMB.

02:11:31.283 --> 02:11:32.584
WE CAN KILL THEM AND EAT THEM

02:11:32.651 --> 02:11:34.019
DOES.

02:11:34.086 --> 02:11:35.787
NOT IN IN KHOMEYN BUT THE

02:11:35.854 --> 02:11:37.823
SOMEWHAT THE PRODUCTS --

THAT THE WE CAN USE. FOR HUMAN

02:11:42.327 --> 02:11:47.633
CONSUMPTION OF FOR OUR NECESSITY

02:11:47.699 --> 02:11:48.767
AS SUCH AS THOSE ARE NOT THE

02:11:48.834 --> 02:11:52.738
HUMANE HOW DO YOU REALLY DEFINE.

02:11:52.804 --> 02:11:54.006
OF THOSE KIND OF A DEFINITION

02:11:54.072 --> 02:11:59.244
SOME ON A DIFFERENT ANIMALS.

02:11:59.311 --> 02:12:01.213
THANK YOU I'M.

02:12:01.280 --> 02:12:02.214
I WOULD LIKE TO JUST TRIED OUT

02:12:02.281 --> 02:12:03.548
QUICKLY ANSWER THE QUESTIONS IN

02:12:03.615 --> 02:12:05.584
TERMS OF ECONOMIC IMPACT I CAN'T

02:12:05.651 --> 02:12:06.852
GIVE YOU ANY EXACT FIGURES BUT

02:12:06.918 --> 02:12:08.654
WE THE BILL STILL DOES ALLOW THE

02:12:08.720 --> 02:12:09.955
SALE OF SOME OF CERTAIN FOR

02:12:10.022 --> 02:12:11.256
PRODUCTS.

02:12:11.323 --> 02:12:12.624
CAO SHEEP.

02:12:12.691 --> 02:12:14.993
LEATHER SO IF THEY ARE A

02:12:15.060 --> 02:12:16.028
BUSINESSES THAT ARE SELLING

02:12:16.094 --> 02:12:17.462
THOSE KINDS OF PRODUCTS.

02:12:17.529 --> 02:12:18.730
THEY WOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO SELL

02:12:18.797 --> 02:12:20.098
A MAIN CORE FOX BUT THEY WOULD

02:12:20.165 --> 02:12:21.366
BE ABLE TO SELL THOSE OTHER

02:12:21.433 --> 02:12:22.768
TYPES OF FURS AS WELL AS

02:12:22.834 --> 02:12:23.869
SYNTHETIC FIRST.

02:12:23.935 --> 02:12:27.739
SO YOU COULD STILL HAVE A STORE

02:12:27.806 --> 02:12:28.540
JUST BE SELLING A DIFFERENT TYPE

02:12:28.607 --> 02:12:30.175
REFER -- IN

02:12:30.242 --> 02:12:32.144
THEN ABOUT YOUR QUESTION ABOUT

02:12:32.210 --> 02:12:34.179
BUYING ELSEWHERE THAT IS TRUE

02:12:34.246 --> 02:12:35.714
YOU COULD BUY THE FOR ELSEWHERE.

02:12:35.781 --> 02:12:37.916
BUT US IN CALIFORNIA ACTING DOES

02:12:37.983 --> 02:12:39.418
SEND A VERY STRONG MARKET SIGNAL

02:12:39.484 --> 02:12:40.952
IT WOULD CHANGE OUR PRODUCT

02:12:41.019 --> 02:12:43.155
STREAMS FROM MAJOR MANUFACTURERS

02:12:43.221 --> 02:12:44.489
AS WE'VE SEEN WITH OUR FUEL

02:12:44.556 --> 02:12:46.091
VEHICLE STANDARDS FOR INSTANCE

02:12:46.158 --> 02:12:47.459
WHERE THEY DON'T JUST MAKE.

02:12:47.526 --> 02:12:49.528
THOSE HIGHER STANDARD VEHICLES

02:12:49.594 --> 02:12:50.362
FOR CALIFORNIA THEY MAKE THEM

02:12:50.429 --> 02:12:51.997
FOR THE REST OF THE NATION SO WE

02:12:52.064 --> 02:12:53.598
EXPECT THAT TO HAVE AN IMPACT

02:12:53.665 --> 02:12:55.100
BUT YES YOU COULD CERTAINLY BY

02:12:55.167 --> 02:12:56.401
FOR SOME OTHER PLACES.

02:12:56.468 --> 02:12:57.869
AS YOU CAN MANY PRODUCTS THAT WE

02:12:57.936 --> 02:12:59.338
DON'T ALLOW HERE FULL GRAW AND

02:12:59.404 --> 02:13:01.406
YOU KNOW OTHER THINGS --

02:13:01.473 --> 02:13:02.674
AND I WOULD JUST ARMED.

02:13:02.741 --> 02:13:04.509
SAY TELL MISTER GALLAGHER I DO --

02:13:04.576 --> 02:13:05.711
HERE YOUR ARGUMENT AND I

02:13:05.777 --> 02:13:07.546
UNDERSTAND IT AND I YOU KNOW AND

02:13:07.612 --> 02:13:09.414
I APPRECIATE IT AND I THINK THAT

02:13:09.481 --> 02:13:11.350
IT'S THE CORRECT QUESTION TO ASK --

02:13:11.416 --> 02:13:12.517
BUT I WILL SAY THAT FOR THIS

02:13:12.584 --> 02:13:14.286
PARTICULAR PRODUCT I DON'T

02:13:14.353 --> 02:13:15.587
BELIEVE THAT THE TYPES OF FOR

02:13:15.654 --> 02:13:18.990
THAT WE'RE ATTEMPTING TO IMPACT.

02:13:19.057 --> 02:13:21.026
ON OUR HUMANE I DON'T THINK THAT

02:13:21.093 --> 02:13:22.461
THEY'RE HUMANELY RAISED I DON'T

02:13:22.527 --> 02:13:23.362
THINK THAT YOU CAN TAKE AN

02:13:23.428 --> 02:13:23.829
ANIMAL THAT IS NOT A

02:13:23.895 --> 02:13:25.731
DOMESTICATED ANIMAL BUT A WILD

02:13:25.797 --> 02:13:27.399
ANIMAL LIKE A FOX SOME INK.

02:13:27.466 --> 02:13:28.700
AND REASON IN A VERY SMALL CAGE

02:13:28.767 --> 02:13:30.135
ANY HUMANE WAY IT'S JUST NOT

02:13:30.202 --> 02:13:32.037
POSSIBLE THESE ARE ANIMALS THAT

02:13:32.104 --> 02:13:33.672
WANT TO ROMAN BE FREE.

02:13:33.739 --> 02:13:36.074
AND WE KNOW FROM NUMEROUS

02:13:36.141 --> 02:13:37.676
NUMEROUS EXPOSES HAVE BEEN DONE

02:13:37.743 --> 02:13:39.411
ABOUT THE FUR INDUSTRY AROUND

02:13:39.478 --> 02:13:40.412
THE WORLD THAT WHILE THERE MIGHT

02:13:40.479 --> 02:13:43.415
BE SOME.

02:13:43.482 --> 02:13:43.982
SOME YOU KNOW.

02:13:44.049 --> 02:13:44.649
A GOOD ACTORS IN THE SPACE THERE

02:13:44.716 --> 02:13:46.718
ARE A LOT OF BAD ACTORS IN TERMS

02:13:46.785 --> 02:13:48.420
OF HOW THE ANIMALS ARE

02:13:48.487 --> 02:13:50.055
SLAUGHTERED AND TRAPPED.

02:13:50.122 --> 02:13:51.390
AND SO I DO THINK THAT WE HAVE A

02:13:51.456 --> 02:13:53.058
RESPONSIBILITY AS A STATE TO

02:13:53.125 --> 02:13:55.060
MAKE SURE THAT OUR PRODUCTS ARE

02:13:55.127 --> 02:13:56.495
CAUSING MISERY AROUND THE WORLD.

02:13:56.561 --> 02:13:57.963
AND THIS IS A PRODUCT THAT BY

02:13:58.029 --> 02:14:00.098
ITS NATURE IS NOT ONLY

02:14:00.165 --> 02:14:01.633
UNSUSTAINABLE BECAUSE EVEN

02:14:01.700 --> 02:14:02.267
THOUGH THEY'RE SOME BY PRODUCTS

02:14:02.334 --> 02:14:03.402
THAT ARE USED THESE ANIMALS

02:14:03.468 --> 02:14:04.836
WOULD NOT BE RAISED.

02:14:04.903 --> 02:14:05.937
THEY DID THESE WOULDN'T EXIST IF

02:14:06.004 --> 02:14:07.005
IT WASN'T FOR FOR A THERE AND

02:14:07.072 --> 02:14:08.240
IT'S NOT A BY PRODUCT OF SOME

02:14:08.306 --> 02:14:10.308
OTHER USE THEIR THERE FOR ONLY

02:14:10.375 --> 02:14:11.943
ANIMALS THAT ARE BEING TRAPPED.

02:14:12.010 --> 02:14:13.612
AND REYES AND THAT IS IN ITSELF

02:14:13.678 --> 02:14:16.581
NOT SUSTAINABLE FOR IS EASILY

02:14:16.648 --> 02:14:17.516
REPLACEABLE SO IT'S NOT A GOOD

02:14:17.582 --> 02:14:19.184
USE FOR YOUR SUIT GOOD USE OF

02:14:19.251 --> 02:14:20.552
RESOURCES --

02:14:20.619 --> 02:14:22.421
WHEN THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES LIKE

02:14:22.487 --> 02:14:23.422
ANIMALS THAT ARE YOU KNOW WITH

02:14:23.488 --> 02:14:25.157
THE THE FOR IS A BY PRODUCT OF

02:14:25.223 --> 02:14:26.792
FOOD PRODUCTION SO I THINK IN

02:14:26.858 --> 02:14:27.626
ITS VERY NATURE IT'S

02:14:27.692 --> 02:14:29.394
UNSUSTAINABLE I BELIEVE IN ITS

02:14:29.461 --> 02:14:30.695
VERY NATURE IT'S IN HUMANE?

02:14:30.762 --> 02:14:32.063
AND I DO THINK THAT CALIFORNIA

02:14:32.130 --> 02:14:33.765
HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT

02:14:33.832 --> 02:14:34.966
THOSE WHO CAN'T SPEAK FOR

02:14:35.033 --> 02:14:36.902
THEMSELVES AND LASTLY I'D SAY

02:14:36.968 --> 02:14:38.069
BUT FOR DOES NOT IN BODY

02:14:38.136 --> 02:14:39.838
CALIFORNIA'S VALUES.

02:14:39.905 --> 02:14:41.706
OUR VALUES ARE OF COMPASSION AND

02:14:41.773 --> 02:14:42.908
SO I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR

02:14:42.974 --> 02:14:44.409
THE STATE TO SAY.

02:14:44.476 --> 02:14:45.777
THIS IS A A PRODUCT THAT WE

02:14:45.844 --> 02:14:47.612
BELIEVE DOES NOT IT DOES NOT

02:14:47.679 --> 02:14:49.548
FULFILL THOSE VALUES IT'S NOT

02:14:49.614 --> 02:14:51.149
WHAT WE WANT TO SEE IN OUR STATE --

02:14:51.216 --> 02:14:52.751
GIVEN ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT

02:14:52.818 --> 02:14:54.886
PROBLEMATIC ELEMENTS AND BY

02:14:54.953 --> 02:14:56.254
ACTING WE DO.

02:14:56.321 --> 02:14:57.422
SEND A SIGNAL SAY ONE OTHER

02:14:57.489 --> 02:14:58.723
THING I REPRESENT HOLLYWOOD I

02:14:58.790 --> 02:14:59.658
HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN MY

02:14:59.724 --> 02:15:01.059
DISTRICT TO DO WERE FOR SOMEONE

02:15:01.126 --> 02:15:02.260
I'VE SPOKEN TO THOSE PEOPLE THEY

02:15:02.327 --> 02:15:03.395
DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT FOR COMES

02:15:03.462 --> 02:15:04.296
FROM THEY DON'T KNOW HOW IT WAS

02:15:04.362 --> 02:15:05.497
RAISED I DON'T KNOW WHAT COUNTRY

02:15:05.564 --> 02:15:06.631
CAME FROM.

02:15:06.698 --> 02:15:07.632
WHEN YOU TELL THEM A LOT OF THEM

02:15:07.699 --> 02:15:09.100
ARE KIND OF HORRIFIED SO IT'S

02:15:09.167 --> 02:15:10.702
NOT THE CASE THE CONSUMERS ARE

02:15:10.769 --> 02:15:13.972
ALWAYS MAKING AN EDUCATED --

02:15:14.039 --> 02:15:14.940
DECISION AND I THINK THAT THIS

02:15:15.006 --> 02:15:18.076
ALSO SENDS A SIGNAL TO THEM THAT --

02:15:18.143 --> 02:15:19.077
THAT MAYBE THERE'S YOU KNOW

02:15:19.144 --> 02:15:20.178
RATHER THAN GOING OUT OF STATE

02:15:20.245 --> 02:15:21.780
