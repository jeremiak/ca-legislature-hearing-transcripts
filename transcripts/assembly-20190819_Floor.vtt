DOWN IN SETTING THE TWO THIRDS

01:11:40.362 --> 01:11:42.931
MAJORITY VOTE THOUGHT FOR TAXES

01:12:16.899 --> 01:12:19.001
THE VOTING THRESHOLD FOR LOCAL

01:12:19.068 --> 01:12:20.436
GOVERNMENTS TO INCUR BONDED

01:12:20.502 --> 01:12:22.204
INDEBTEDNESS FROM THE TWO

01:12:22.271 --> 01:12:26.008
THIRDS REQUIRED IN PROP 13255%

01:12:26.075 --> 01:12:28.077
THE TWO THIRDS REQUIRED. OF

01:12:28.143 --> 01:12:29.144
MAKING THESE GOVERNMENTAL

01:12:29.211 --> 01:12:31.547
DECISIONS IS A VERY APPROPRIATE

01:12:31.613 --> 01:12:32.881
VOTE THRESHOLD AND THAT'S

01:12:32.948 --> 01:12:34.516
BECAUSE THE DECISION TO ENTER

01:12:34.583 --> 01:12:36.652
INDEBTEDNESS IS AMONG THE MOST

01:12:36.719 --> 01:12:37.986
SERIOUS DECISIONS THAT OUR

01:12:38.053 --> 01:12:39.888
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MAKE. WE'RE

01:12:39.955 --> 01:12:41.190
NOT TALKING ABOUT AN

01:12:41.256 --> 01:12:42.558
EXPENDITURE THE JUST OCCURS

01:12:42.624 --> 01:12:44.093
THIS YEAR OR NEXT YEAR WE'RE

01:12:44.159 --> 01:12:46.361
TALKING ABOUT IN MOST CASES

01:12:46.428 --> 01:12:48.063
GOING INTO DEBT FOR TWENTY

01:12:48.130 --> 01:12:49.865
YEARS. WHEN YOU CHOOSE TO

01:12:49.932 --> 01:12:53.035
BORROW MONEY. THAT MEANS YOU'RE

01:12:53.102 --> 01:12:53.669
CHOOSING TO REPAIR IT OVER TIME

01:12:53.736 --> 01:12:55.337
WITH INTEREST SO EVERY DOLLAR

01:12:55.404 --> 01:12:58.173
THAT WE BORROW TODAY. TO FUND

01:12:58.240 --> 01:12:58.707
AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR ROAD

01:12:58.774 --> 01:13:01.910
REPAIR WE COULD DO TWICE AS

01:13:01.977 --> 01:13:02.978
MUCH AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR

01:13:03.045 --> 01:13:05.514
REPAIR TWICE AS MANY ROADS IF

01:13:05.581 --> 01:13:07.082
WE CHOSE TO PAY AS WE GO

01:13:07.149 --> 01:13:08.217
INSTEAD OF GOING INTO DEBT. SO

01:13:08.283 --> 01:13:10.419
THE DECISION TO IT BONDED DEBT

01:13:10.486 --> 01:13:12.221
THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS ONE.

01:13:12.287 --> 01:13:13.021
THAT IS APPROPRIATELY A

01:13:13.088 --> 01:13:13.555
REQUIRES A TWO THIRDS VOTE

01:13:13.622 --> 01:13:16.425
THRESHOLD. BUT I'VE A FURTHER

01:13:16.492 --> 01:13:17.626
CONCERN ABOUT THIS BILL AND

01:13:17.693 --> 01:13:19.928
THAT IS BECAUSE THE BONDS THAT

01:13:19.995 --> 01:13:22.264
ARE FINANCED BY THESE TAXES ARE

01:13:22.331 --> 01:13:23.899
PAID BY PROPERTY TAXES WHICH

01:13:23.966 --> 01:13:25.567
WILL INVARIABLY INCREASE THE

01:13:25.634 --> 01:13:27.169
COST OF HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA

01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:30.005
AND WE ALL KNOW. DIRE PROBLEM

01:13:30.072 --> 01:13:31.206
THAT WE HAVE WITH THE COST OF

01:13:31.273 --> 01:13:34.009
HOUSING HERE ALREADY WE HAVE

01:13:34.076 --> 01:13:36.411
THE HIGHEST POVERTY OF ANY

01:13:36.478 --> 01:13:36.979
STATE IN THE COUNTRY WE HAVE

01:13:37.045 --> 01:13:38.480
THE HIGHEST HOMELESSNESS OF ANY

01:13:38.547 --> 01:13:41.049
STATE IN THE COUNTRY. THIS BILL

01:13:41.116 --> 01:13:43.051
WILL MAKE THAT SITUATION MORE.

01:13:43.118 --> 01:13:46.488
BUT COLLEAGUES. YOU CAN ARGUE.

01:13:46.555 --> 01:13:48.056
OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE NOT

01:13:48.123 --> 01:13:48.590
HURTING. WE'VE GOT SCHOOL

01:13:48.657 --> 01:13:49.191
DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE.

01:13:49.258 --> 01:13:49.691
THAT ARE FLIRTING WITH

01:13:49.758 --> 01:13:50.959
BANKRUPTCY I HAVE ONE OF THE

01:13:51.026 --> 01:13:52.628
CITIES IN MY DISTRICT. IS

01:13:52.694 --> 01:13:53.629
TALKING ABOUT DISSING

01:13:53.695 --> 01:13:56.431
CORPORATION BECAUSE THEY DON'T

01:13:56.498 --> 01:13:57.032
HAVE A ENOUGH REVENUE TO MEET

01:13:57.099 --> 01:13:59.935
THEIR OBLIGATIONS. BUT HOW DO

01:14:00.002 --> 01:14:00.669
YOU RECONCILE THAT WITH THE

01:14:00.736 --> 01:14:03.672
FACT THAT WE GET A TWENTY ONE

01:14:03.739 --> 01:14:04.273
BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET SURPLUS

01:14:04.339 --> 01:14:06.108
AT THE STATE LEVEL THIS YEAR.

01:14:06.175 --> 01:14:08.243
COLLEAGUES WHAT WE HEAR IS NOT

01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:09.545
A REVENUE PROBLEM IT IS A

01:14:09.611 --> 01:14:12.414
REVENUE ALLOCATION PROBLEM.

01:14:12.481 --> 01:14:16.985
LASTLY. I WOULD ARGUE THAT THIS

01:14:17.052 --> 01:14:20.455
BILL IS COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY.

01:14:20.522 --> 01:14:21.590
IF YOU LOOK AT THE LAST

01:14:21.657 --> 01:14:22.991
ELECTION CYCLE AND YOU LOOK AT

01:14:23.058 --> 01:14:25.060
THE VOTE THRESHOLD THERE WAS

01:14:25.127 --> 01:14:27.229
REQUIRED THEIR OF TWO THIRDS

01:14:27.296 --> 01:14:28.597
AND YOU TALLY ALL OF THE BONDS

01:14:28.664 --> 01:14:31.099
THAT PASSED DID YOU KNOW THAT

01:14:31.166 --> 01:14:34.203
OVER 80% OF THE BONDS ON THE

01:14:34.269 --> 01:14:36.338
BALLOT LAST CYCLE PASSED OVER

01:14:36.405 --> 01:14:38.907
EIGHTY PERCENT. SO THE QUESTION

01:14:38.974 --> 01:14:39.508
IS WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD BE

01:14:39.575 --> 01:14:41.410
AN APPROPRIATE VOTE THRESHOLD.

01:14:41.476 --> 01:14:45.414
WHAT DO YOU THINK. MESSAGE RATE

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:45.981
WE WANT MORE THAN 80% OF THE

01:14:46.048 --> 01:14:47.783
VOTE THESE BONDS TO PASS.

01:14:47.850 --> 01:14:49.051
COLLEAGUES THIS BILL IS BAD FOR

01:14:49.117 --> 01:14:51.019
CALIFORNIA IT MORTGAGES OUR

01:14:51.086 --> 01:14:52.554
CHILDREN'S FUTURE FOR THE SAKE

01:14:52.621 --> 01:14:54.156

WORST HOUSING AFFORDABILITY

01:15:16.278 --> 01:15:19.047
CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY.

01:15:19.114 --> 01:15:19.882
RIGHT NOW UNFORTUNATELY THE

01:15:19.948 --> 01:15:20.482
CURRENT THRESHOLD FOR LOCAL.

01:15:20.549 --> 01:15:22.618
MEASURES TIED THE HANDS OF OUR

LOCAL COMMUNITIES THIS ACA'S

01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:26.154
CRITICAL TO ALLOW LOCAL

JURISDICTIONS TO INVEST LOCAL

01:15:27.623 --> 01:15:28.991
DOLLARS BACK IN A HOUSING

01:15:29.057 --> 01:15:31.026
PROJECT INTO AFFORDABLE HOUSING

WIDE. AND AFFORDABLE HOW ONE

01:15:40.369 --> 01:15:42.437
PROPOSITION ONE ONLY NEEDED A

SIMPLE MAJORITY TO PASS IT DID

01:15:44.806 --> 01:15:46.675
IF IT HAD BEEN LOCAL PARK SURE

01:15:46.742 --> 01:15:47.142
IT WOULD HAVE FAILED.

01:15:47.209 --> 01:15:48.577
REQUIREMENTS TOO MANY

01:15:48.644 --> 01:15:49.144
COMMUNITIES HAVE HAD LOCAL

01:15:49.211 --> 01:15:50.445
MEASURES FAIL UNDER THIS

01:15:50.512 --> 01:15:51.680
BURDENSOME REQUIREMENTS EVEN

01:15:51.747 --> 01:15:53.515
THOUGH THEY GOT WELL OVER A

01:15:53.582 --> 01:15:55.984
MAJORITY OF VOTES WE ARE

01:15:56.051 --> 01:15:59.421

OPPOSITION. I WANT US TO THINK

01:16:30.252 --> 01:16:30.686
VERY SERIOUSLY ABOUT THE

01:16:30.752 --> 01:16:32.988
CONSEQUENCES. OF REDUCING A

01:16:33.055 --> 01:16:34.890
THRESHOLD FOR PASSAGE. WITH

01:16:34.957 --> 01:16:36.792
REDUCING ACCOUNTABILITY AND

01:16:36.858 --> 01:16:41.496
REDUCING. THE PROMISES MADE AND

PROMISES KEPT TO THE VOTERS

01:16:44.433 --> 01:16:46.268
THAT WE PRESENT THESE BONDS AND

THRESHOLD HAS HISTORICALLY

01:16:54.810 --> 01:16:56.545
REQUIRED THE PROPONENTS OF THE

DEATH. TO BE VERY CLEAR ON WHAT

01:17:01.149 --> 01:17:05.120
IT'S GOING TO GO FOR. WE HAVE

01:17:05.187 --> 01:17:07.022
SCHOOL BOARDS FOR EXAMPLE THAT

01:17:07.089 --> 01:17:10.559
I'VE SUPPORTED. BOND INCREASES

01:17:10.625 --> 01:17:12.728
FOR VERY GOOD REASONS WHY

01:17:12.794 --> 01:17:14.763
BECAUSE WHEN THEY WENT TO THE

01:17:14.830 --> 01:17:15.664
BALLOT BOX AND HAD TO GET THE

01:17:15.731 --> 01:17:17.766
TWO THIRDS THRESHOLD THEY WERE

01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:29.411
PROMISE. THAT NUMBER TWO I COME

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:30.746
FROM A SELF HELP COUNTY. ONE OF

01:17:30.812 --> 01:17:35.317
THE VERY FIRST POLITICAL. I

01:17:35.384 --> 01:17:37.552
INVOLVEMENTS WAS WITH MEASURES

01:17:37.619 --> 01:17:40.589
SEEK WHICH IS A TRANSPORTATION.

01:17:40.655 --> 01:17:44.593
TAX IT REQUIRES THE TWO THIRDS.

01:17:44.659 --> 01:17:47.763
IT HAS DONE WONDERS FOR OUR

01:17:47.829 --> 01:17:49.297
COMMUNITY IN FACT YOU CAN DRIVE

01:17:49.364 --> 01:17:51.066
AROUND THE FIFTH LARGEST CITY

01:17:51.133 --> 01:17:53.001
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE

01:17:53.068 --> 01:17:53.902
HAVE ABOUT A TWENTY OR TWENTY

01:17:53.969 --> 01:17:55.137
FIVE MINUTE DRIVE TIME IN THE

01:17:55.203 --> 01:17:57.839
WORST. TRAFFIC LOCATIONS IT HAS

01:17:57.906 --> 01:18:01.410
BEEN OUT NOT ONLY PASSED BUT

01:18:01.476 --> 01:18:05.013
HAS BEEN PASSED AGAIN. WHY

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:05.614
BECAUSE IN ORDER TO GET TO THE

01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:08.383
TWO THIRDS THRESHOLD. IT

01:18:08.450 --> 01:18:09.885
REQUIRED US TO BE VERY VERY

01:18:09.951 --> 01:18:13.121
CLEAR. ON WHAT WE WERE GOING TO

01:18:13.188 --> 01:18:16.792
DO WITH THE MONEY. I KNOW THAT

01:18:16.858 --> 01:18:17.926
THERE IS A LANGUAGE WITH

01:18:17.993 --> 01:18:20.362
RESPECT TO WELL THERE'S GOING

01:18:20.429 --> 01:18:21.863
TO BE OVERSIGHT AND OTHER KINDS

01:18:21.930 --> 01:18:25.100
OF THINGS. MY POINT IS THAT AS

01:18:25.167 --> 01:18:27.736
YOU REDUCE THE VOTE THRESHOLD

01:18:27.803 --> 01:18:29.071
YOU INHERENTLY REDUCE THE

01:18:29.137 --> 01:18:33.475
OVERSIGHT. IT BECOMES MORE AND

01:18:33.542 --> 01:18:36.578
MORE ON NECESSARY TO BE VERY

01:18:36.645 --> 01:18:38.313
VERY SPECIFIC AND TO DEAL WITH

01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:43.485
THE THOSE WHO WOULD SAY I LIKE

01:18:43.552 --> 01:18:45.787
THE IDEA OF BEING A SELF HELP

01:18:45.854 --> 01:18:48.356
COUNTY BUT I WANT TO HAVE MORE.

01:18:48.423 --> 01:18:51.393
RESPONSIBILITY WITH MY VOTE TO

01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:53.628
BE ABLE TO REQUIRE THAT A

01:18:53.695 --> 01:18:56.465
PARTICULAR PROJECT BE

01:18:56.531 --> 01:18:58.967

PROPERTY OWNERS AND WILL BE

01:19:10.345 --> 01:19:13.014
SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECTED BY IT.

01:19:13.081 --> 01:19:15.717
ALL THE OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN

01:19:15.784 --> 01:19:17.385
BUT IT ALSO REQUIRES THE

01:19:17.452 --> 01:19:18.687
PROPONENTS AND I'VE BEEN ON

01:19:18.753 --> 01:19:21.356
THIS SIDE OF BEING A PROPONENT

01:19:21.423 --> 01:19:23.125
AND HAVING TO COME TO A TWO

01:19:23.191 --> 01:19:25.327
THIRDS VOTE AND TO BE ABLE TO

01:19:25.393 --> 01:19:28.163
GO TO THE VOTERS. AND SAY THIS

AND CLEAR OUT WE HAVE BEEN. AND

01:19:39.708 --> 01:19:42.544
SO I WARN YOU AGAINST THE

01:19:42.611 --> 01:19:44.146
PRESUMPTION HERE THAT IF YOU

01:19:44.212 --> 01:19:45.680
RAISE YOUR REDUCE THE-

01:19:45.747 --> 01:19:49.417
THRESHOLD THAT YOU GET BETTER

01:19:49.484 --> 01:19:51.419
BOND EXPENDITURE I DON'T THINK

01:19:51.486 --> 01:19:53.255
YOU DO I THINK THE HIGHER THE

01:19:53.321 --> 01:19:55.924
THRESHOLD THE MORE SPECIFIC AND

01:19:55.991 --> 01:19:58.727
DIRECT A COMMITMENT. WE MUST

01:19:58.793 --> 01:20:00.862
MAKE IN ORDER TO GET IT PASSED

01:20:00.929 --> 01:20:03.465
IT IS NOT MERELY A PROTECTION

01:20:03.532 --> 01:20:05.367
FOR THOSE WHO WILL BEAR THE

01:20:05.433 --> 01:20:07.469
MOST BURDEN OF SPUR EXAMPLE

01:20:07.536 --> 01:20:10.205
PROPERTY TAX INCREASE. BUT IT

01:20:10.272 --> 01:20:13.241
IS A IT REALLY IS A GUARANTEE.

01:20:13.308 --> 01:20:14.910
THAT IF YOU ARE AS CLEAR AS

01:20:14.976 --> 01:20:16.978
POSSIBLE AND YOU PUT UP SIGNS

01:20:17.045 --> 01:20:18.813
ALL ACROSS YOUR SCHOOL BOARD

01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:20.315
LOCATIONS IN SCHOOLS A SAID

01:20:20.382 --> 01:20:21.750
THIS GETS A CAFETERIA THIS ONE

01:20:21.816 --> 01:20:25.086
GETS A- GYMNASIUM. THESE ARE

01:20:25.153 --> 01:20:25.654
THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT I

01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:27.656
THINK THE THRESHOLD. UP

01:20:27.722 --> 01:20:30.492
REQUIRES THE PROPONENTS TO DO.

01:20:30.559 --> 01:20:31.359
AND INSTEAD OF RUNNING AWAY

01:20:31.426 --> 01:20:32.627
FROM A THRESHOLD OF

01:20:32.694 --> 01:20:34.062
ACCOUNTABILITY I THINK WE

01:20:34.129 --> 01:20:36.231
SHOULD BE EMBRACING A THRESHOLD

01:20:36.298 --> 01:20:40.202
ACCOUNTABILITY WE GET THOSE

01:20:40.268 --> 01:20:42.003
PASSED 80% OF THEM HAVE BEEN

01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:42.771
PASSED. I BELIEVE IT'S BECAUSE

01:20:42.837 --> 01:20:44.039
TOLD US HIGH AND SO THE

01:20:44.105 --> 01:20:45.473
RESPONSIBILITY TO BE

01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:46.975
TRANSPARENT AND RESPONSIBILITY

01:20:47.042 --> 01:20:48.577
TO MAKE PROMISES AND THEN KEEP

01:20:48.643 --> 01:20:51.947
THEM IS ALSO A HIGH THRESHOLD.

01:20:52.013 --> 01:20:52.480
FOR THOSE REASONS I WOULD

01:20:52.547 --> 01:20:56.418
SUGGEST A NO VOTE. DOCTOR

01:20:56.484 --> 01:20:57.852
WOULD. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

01:20:57.919 --> 01:20:59.020
THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND

01:20:59.087 --> 01:21:00.989
MEMBERS I'D I APPRECIATE THE

01:21:01.056 --> 01:21:02.157
DEBATE HERE AT I WOULD POINT

01:21:02.224 --> 01:21:03.425
OUT I BELIEVE IF I'M NOT

01:21:03.491 --> 01:21:05.794
MISTAKEN THAT. SCHOOL BOND

01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:07.963
MEASURES ARE AT 55% CURRENTLY.

01:21:08.029 --> 01:21:12.567
SO 55% IS THE NUMBER THAT I

01:21:12.634 --> 01:21:14.002
UNDERSTAND I ALSO POINT OUT

01:21:14.069 --> 01:21:15.770
THAT WE ARE NOT THIS IS PAT

01:21:15.837 --> 01:21:17.572
VOTING TODAY DOES NOT PASS THIS

01:21:17.639 --> 01:21:18.740
THIS IS A MEASURE THAT GOES

01:21:18.807 --> 01:21:20.508
BEFORE THE VOTERS TO LET THE

01:21:20.575 --> 01:21:22.510
VOTERS DECIDE WHETHER THEY WANT

01:21:22.577 --> 01:21:24.012
TO CHANGE THE THRESHOLD OR NOT

01:21:24.079 --> 01:21:26.114
SO I RISE TO IT TODAY AS A CO

01:21:26.181 --> 01:21:27.349
AUTHOR TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF

01:21:27.415 --> 01:21:29.251
THIS VERY IMPORTANT MEASURE AND

01:21:29.317 --> 01:21:30.252
THE POSITIVE IMPACT IT COULD

01:21:30.318 --> 01:21:31.987
HAVE ON MY RURAL DISTRICT.

01:21:32.053 --> 01:21:33.488
COMMUNITIES IN RURAL CALIFORNIA

01:21:33.555 --> 01:21:35.123
DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO MANY OF

THE RESOURCES PUBLIC PRIVATE

01:21:37.525 --> 01:21:38.793
PARTNERSHIPS THAT PROVIDE

01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:39.928
CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IT THAT

01:21:39.995 --> 01:21:41.630
URBAN COMMUNITIES DO FOR

AREAS FOR TOP OF LIKE LIKE I

01:22:02.350 --> 01:22:03.485
WOULD LIKE TO SEE. IT IS MY

01:22:03.551 --> 01:22:04.619
COMMUNITIES THAT WANT TO RAISE

01:22:04.686 --> 01:22:05.720

CHALLENGES. EDUCATING VOTERS IN

ADVOCATING FOR BALLOT MEASURES

01:22:09.391 --> 01:22:10.125
IN COMMUNITIES THAT CAN SPREAD

01:22:10.191 --> 01:22:12.127
OUT OVER HUNDREDS OF MILES CAN

01:22:12.193 --> 01:22:14.129
PROVE IMPOSSIBLE FOR SMALL

01:22:14.195 --> 01:22:14.729
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ALREADY

STRAPPEDFOR RESOURCES. MEMBERS

01:22:16.931 --> 01:22:18.300

COLLEAGUES FAVOR THIS I

01:22:37.619 --> 01:22:41.523
ACTUALLY STRONGLY OPPOSE IT.

01:22:41.589 --> 01:22:42.157
AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO SPEAK

01:22:42.223 --> 01:22:44.626
TO I THINK THE DISCIPLINE. OF

01:22:44.693 --> 01:22:46.361
ANY IN A COMMUNITY IN A TWO

01:22:46.428 --> 01:22:50.632
THIRDS CONVERSATION. IT ONLY A

01:22:50.699 --> 01:22:52.400
DISCIPLINE IN A DEMOCRACY THAT

01:22:52.467 --> 01:22:54.035
BROADENS PARTICIPATION SHARED

01:22:54.102 --> 01:22:55.837
COMMUNITY VALUES. CONFRONTS

01:22:55.904 --> 01:22:59.541
POLARIZATION. IT IS A SALVATORI

01:22:59.607 --> 01:23:02.677
EXPERIENCE TO HAVE TO SPEAK TO

01:23:02.744 --> 01:23:05.680
A LARGER COMMUNITY. WHEN A LONG

01:23:05.747 --> 01:23:06.281
TERM FINANCIAL GROUP IS BEING

01:23:06.348 --> 01:23:08.950
MADE. IN MY CAREER I

01:23:09.017 --> 01:23:13.221
PARTICIPATED IN NUMEROUS.

01:23:13.288 --> 01:23:15.023
BALLOT FIGHTS INVOLVED A TWO

01:23:15.090 --> 01:23:17.492
THIRDS VOTE AND ACTUALLY FEEL

01:23:17.559 --> 01:23:18.860
IT IS A WHOLESOME JUST WANTED

01:23:18.927 --> 01:23:20.962
DEMOCRACY TO HAVE TO REACH OUT

01:23:21.029 --> 01:23:24.099
TO BROAD LINES. I ACTUALLY.

01:23:24.165 --> 01:23:26.000
HAVE AN ISSUE SOME WITH THE

01:23:26.067 --> 01:23:27.869
INFRASTRUCTURE ASPECTS OF THIS

01:23:27.936 --> 01:23:29.170
BILL THE TAX PIECES OF THE ONES

01:23:29.237 --> 01:23:33.908
A BOTHER ME WHEN I STARTED THIS

01:23:33.975 --> 01:23:34.442
BILL IN SO LONG AGO IT WAS

01:23:34.509 --> 01:23:35.009
BEFORE PROP THIRTEEN. NOW I

01:23:35.076 --> 01:23:38.780
REMEMBER THE MOST OF TAXATION

01:23:38.847 --> 01:23:41.182
GOING TO THE ROOF. AND IMPEDED

01:23:41.249 --> 01:23:43.718
MY ABILITY TO BUY A HOME.

01:23:43.785 --> 01:23:44.319
BECAUSE I WAS A RUNNER WHEN I

01:23:44.386 --> 01:23:47.422
STARTED HERE. IN THE CURRENT

01:23:47.489 --> 01:23:49.124
CLIMATE I KNOW YOUNG YOUNG

01:23:49.190 --> 01:23:50.759
COUPLES OUTSTANDING COUPLES

01:23:50.825 --> 01:23:53.428
CELLPHONE EMPLOYED COUPLES WITH

01:23:53.495 --> 01:23:55.029
WITH GOOD JOBS WORD ABOUT.

01:23:55.096 --> 01:23:58.166
BUYING A HOME IN CALIFORNIA. I

01:23:58.233 --> 01:23:59.968
KNOW YOUNG COUPLES ARE THINKING

01:24:00.034 --> 01:24:01.669
GEE MAYBE WE SHOULD UNDERTAKE

01:24:01.736 --> 01:24:03.671
TO GET OUT OF READING. FIND A

01:24:03.738 --> 01:24:07.008
WAY TO RUN A MOTOR HOME. AND

01:24:07.075 --> 01:24:07.976
LIVE THROUGH YOUR STARTED I

01:24:08.042 --> 01:24:09.544
TENER WAY TO SET ASIDE FUNDS SO

01:24:09.611 --> 01:24:11.212
THEY CAN SOLVE A CONUNDRUM OF

01:24:11.279 --> 01:24:14.516
HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA. SO I'M

01:24:14.582 --> 01:24:15.116
ACTUALLY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

01:24:15.183 --> 01:24:17.819
THE TAXATION PIECE OF THIS. I

01:24:17.886 --> 01:24:20.755
DON'T BELIEVE IT IS IT'S SUCH A

01:24:20.822 --> 01:24:21.356
BIG ARTICLE BECAUSE THIS IS A

01:24:21.423 --> 01:24:24.626
DEMOCRACY. THE GLOBE NEEDS

01:24:24.692 --> 01:24:26.861
EXAMPLES OF DEMOCRACIES THAT

01:24:26.928 --> 01:24:30.565
LISTEN EVERYBODY. THE PUBLIC

01:24:30.632 --> 01:24:32.133
POLICY DEBATE ACTUALLY RECKONS

01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:33.501
WITH THE VIEWS OF PEOPLE

01:24:33.568 --> 01:24:34.068
THEY'RE DIFFERENT TO BE. AND

01:24:34.135 --> 01:24:37.639
MOVE THE STATE FORWARD. I THINK

01:24:37.705 --> 01:24:38.106
THAT IS IMPORTANT FOR

01:24:38.173 --> 01:24:38.706
CALIFORNIA THINGS IMPORTANT IN

01:24:38.773 --> 01:24:43.344
THE GLOBAL. SO I ACTUALLY FEEL

01:24:43.411 --> 01:24:44.646
AS I SAY GOOD WITH

01:24:44.712 --> 01:24:46.614
INFRASTRUCTURE PRIESTS I THINK

01:24:46.681 --> 01:24:48.950
THE TAXATION PIECES BAD I DON'T

01:24:49.017 --> 01:24:51.152
ACTUALLY BELIEVE THE BURDEN.

01:24:51.219 --> 01:24:53.922
THE CHALLENGER GET INTO TWO

01:24:53.988 --> 01:24:54.522
THIRDS I THINK THAT REQUIRES A

01:24:54.589 --> 01:24:57.525
DIFFERENT TYPE OF SKILL SET. SO

01:24:57.592 --> 01:24:59.427
THE CAMPAIGN I LOGS OF THE

01:24:59.494 --> 01:24:59.961
DEATH BUT ENGAGING PEOPLE

01:25:00.028 --> 01:25:02.297
LISTENING AND WORKING TO GROW

01:25:02.363 --> 01:25:04.933
CONSENSUS AROUND A FUTURE.

01:25:04.999 --> 01:25:08.036
WHETHER IT'S OF WHATEVER TYPE.

01:25:08.102 --> 01:25:09.571
WE'RE BASE OF THE CAMPAIGN IS

01:25:09.637 --> 01:25:11.806
ABOUT WHAT IS EXIST IN THE

01:25:11.873 --> 01:25:12.407
STATUS QUO IS INIMICAL TO THE

01:25:12.474 --> 01:25:14.976
WELL BEING OF PEOPLE. AND

01:25:15.043 --> 01:25:15.543
THEREFORE THEY WILL SERVE BY

01:25:15.610 --> 01:25:17.979
GOING TO DIFFERENT DIRECTION.

01:25:18.046 --> 01:25:19.781
WHICH CAN INCLUDE UNDERTAKING

01:25:19.848 --> 01:25:22.150
OF FINANCIAL OBJECTIVES YEAH IN

01:25:22.217 --> 01:25:23.485
MY OWN COUNTY I WAS VERY

01:25:23.551 --> 01:25:26.221
INVOLVED IN MEASURE REIN IN TWO

01:25:26.287 --> 01:25:26.754
THOUSAND FOR MY FIRST NINE

MONTHS IS ELECTED OFFICIALS.

01:25:29.591 --> 01:25:31.392

VOTE IN SECOND COUNTY AS A SELF

01:25:32.093 --> 01:25:35.463
HELP COUNTY. BUT THE IN EVENTS

01:25:35.530 --> 01:25:37.131
SO I LOOK AT THIS I ACTUALLY

01:25:37.198 --> 01:25:37.599
FEEL THERE'S IMPORTANT

01:25:37.665 --> 01:25:39.267
DEMOCRATIC VALUES IMPLICIT IN

01:25:39.334 --> 01:25:40.869
THIS I DON'T THINK THE TWO

01:25:40.935 --> 01:25:42.904
THIRDS IS AN INSUPERABLE

01:25:42.971 --> 01:25:44.739
BARRIER INDEED I THINK IT.

01:25:44.806 --> 01:25:48.142

LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE UNDER

01:26:06.761 --> 01:26:08.329
ENORMOUS PRESSURE TO MAINTAIN

01:26:08.396 --> 01:26:10.965
OUR EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE IN

01:26:11.032 --> 01:26:12.834
THAT REALITIES COMPOUNDING ARE

THROUGH THE COST ALL OVER AGAIN

01:35:10.938 --> 01:35:12.273
TO PLACE IT BACK AND GET IT

01:35:12.339 --> 01:35:14.008
PASSED THE SECOND TIME AND THAT

01:35:14.075 --> 01:35:15.709

01:35:15.776 --> 01:35:17.745
HIGHEST OBLIGATION WHEN IT

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER THERE

01:35:32.726 --> 01:35:34.228
SEEMS TO BE A GREAT MYSTERY

01:35:34.295 --> 01:35:36.764
TODAY AS TO WHY WE CAN'T GET

01:35:36.831 --> 01:35:37.698
SOME OF THESE BOND MEASURES

01:35:37.765 --> 01:35:39.400
PASSED WITH A TWO THIRDS VOTE

01:35:39.467 --> 01:35:42.937
SO LET ME HELP SOLVE IT FOR YOU

01:35:43.003 --> 01:35:43.471
IT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE CAN'T

01:35:43.537 --> 01:35:44.071
AFFORD IT. BECAUSE THEY DON'T

01:35:44.138 --> 01:35:46.140
WANT IT. IF YOU CAN'T GET THE

01:35:46.207 --> 01:35:46.774
THRESHOLD THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN

01:35:46.841 --> 01:35:49.977
SET. BY LAW THAT MEANS PEOPLE

01:35:50.044 --> 01:35:51.912
DON'T WANT TO. YOU MIGHT WANT

01:35:51.979 --> 01:35:55.416

WANT THAT INVOICE. THERE'S NO

01:36:05.493 --> 01:36:08.329
REASON TO CHANGE IT I THINK THE

01:36:08.395 --> 01:36:10.965
VOTERS HAVE SPOKEN IF SOME OF

01:36:11.031 --> 01:36:12.233
THESE BOND MEASURES HAVE FAILED

01:36:12.299 --> 01:36:14.668
THAT'S WERE GOOD REASON BECAUSE

01:36:14.735 --> 01:36:15.236
THEY DON'T WANT TO BUY WHAT
