ARE CONCERNED THREE THE STATE
THE WAR CITY IT COULD BE

00:11:29.289 --> 00:11:34.794
APPLIED THAT ALREADY HAS TURNED
SO IT'S GREAT TO STEP DOWN

00:11:35.662 --> 00:11:43.069
QUESTIONS ABOUT CHARTER THINGS
THAT CREATES THAT CREATES E.

00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:51.144
PLEASE SAME AS AND THREE
WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SEE THAT'S

00:11:51.611 --> 00:11:58.518

00:11:58.518 --> 00:12:02.822
CURRENT RESEARCH GREENHOUSE
GAS POOLS CERTAINLY DAYS ON

00:12:05.758 --> 00:12:12.265
AND OUR PEOPLE ISNT TREATS LIKE
YOUR VEHICLES LIKE CONVENTIONAL

00:12:13.132 --> 00:12:14.634
AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS

00:12:17.604 --> 00:12:19.439
CAROLINE ALL HUNCHED OVER
HALF OF THE IN W.

00:12:19.439 --> 00:12:23.943
NORTH AMERICA WE ARE ALSO
PROPOSING THAT WE HAVE

00:12:24.444 --> 00:12:27.680
THE FACT ELECTION WITH A
MANDATE TO SELL CARS AND

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:33.052
THIS COST TABLE RIVER FOUGHT
AT ACCEPTED AN OFFER WITH

00:12:33.052 --> 00:12:38.057
RESPECT TO TIME IS THE NEXT
THING THAT HAPPENED BACK

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:51.938
JOHN BECAUSE OF THE HALF AWAKE
HUNDREDS WHO WERE TALK ABOUT WE

00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:55.875
DO SECOND SECOND WAIT A SECOND
ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM

00:12:55.875 --> 00:13:00.013
COMMITTEE MEMBERS MITCHELL
ORTEGA'S CHAIR MISTER TING

00:13:00.046 --> 00:13:03.516
SO THE WHOLE REASON WHY THIS
COMMITTEE EXERCISES OVERSIGHT

00:13:03.516 --> 00:13:07.353
OVER CONVEYANCE IN THE STATE
IS TO SET STATEWIDE REGULATION

00:13:07.353 --> 00:13:09.822
AND AVOID THE PATCHWORK OF
DIFFERENT LOCAL REGULATIONS

00:13:09.822 --> 00:13:13.826
IN DIFFERENT AREAS NOT DISPEL
APPLIES ONLY TO A SINGLE CITY

00:13:13.826 --> 00:13:17.664
AND SEEMS TO BE A SIGNIFICANT
DEPARTURE FROM THE PAST CUSTOM

00:13:17.664 --> 00:13:20.867
AND PRACTICE OF THE REGULATION
OF THIS INDUSTRY SO AND EXPLAIN

00:13:20.867 --> 00:13:23.936
WHY IT'S NECESSARY JUST FOR
THIS ONE CITY TO TAKE THIS

00:13:23.936 --> 00:13:30.443
ACTION THIS CD ON MY THINGS
WHERE HE'S TO HOWEVER START

00:13:30.443 --> 00:13:34.480
CRYSTAL HEADQUARTERS GARCIA
AND THIS TECHNOLOGY THESE

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:38.284
COMPANIES ARE REALLY STARTED
IN SAN FRANCISCO SINCE WE

00:13:38.284 --> 00:13:42.789
HAVE ON REALLY -- FOR THE
BROAD AND GROWING DISPENSED

00:13:42.789 --> 00:13:45.525
SIGNIFICANT GROWING PAINS OF
OUR RELATIONSHIP CITY POINT

00:13:45.525 --> 00:13:49.362
OF VIEW AT LEAST TWO COMPANIES
SO WHAT I WOULD SAY THIS IS

00:13:49.362 --> 00:13:53.866
A VERY HISTORIC AGREEMENT AT
TIMES AND AT THE TIME GRACIOUS

00:13:53.866 --> 00:13:57.337
GOOD PUNCHES AND CONTENTIOUS
THIS REALLY UNCONSCIONABLE

00:13:57.337 --> 00:14:01.507
CHAPTER IN THAT RELATIONSHIP
WHERE THE COMPANIES ARE COMING

00:14:01.507 --> 00:14:02.642
TOGETHER POINT B.

00:14:02.642 --> 00:14:06.045
PART OF THE SOLUTION MONEY
WERE REASONABLE GO INTO TRANSIT

00:14:06.045 --> 00:14:09.415
AS WELL AS PEDESTRIAN BICYCLE
SAFETY I KNOW MISTER MOORE HAD

00:14:09.415 --> 00:14:12.185
MENTIONED HIS CONCERN FOR ON
THE SIDES OF THE PARENTS JUST

00:14:12.185 --> 00:14:16.022
FOR EXAMPLE BASED ON WHO RATES
I SUPPOSE IN LEGISLATION YOU

00:14:16.022 --> 00:14:20.727
A TWENTY DOLLAR MY IF YOU WERE
AN INDIVIDUAL I WOULD GET SICK

00:14:20.727 --> 00:14:24.497
FIVE CENTS AND IF YOU ARE IN
THE RIGHT SHARE SITUATION YOU

00:14:24.497 --> 00:14:28.534
CAN POINT OWNERSHIP YOUR FEE
HIS THIRTIES SO I CAN ONLY

00:14:28.534 --> 00:14:32.205
THINK THIS FEE IS MANY OF
US BUT YEAH I WILL GIVE YOU

00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:36.209
WOULD MEAN SIGNIFICANTLY LESS
ABOUT THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:41.948
WE DON'T BELIEVE IT WILL
HAPPEN ON ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE

00:14:41.948 --> 00:14:45.985
INDUSTRY OBVIOUSLY AS A CITY
WE ARE FILTER EXTRAORDINARILY

00:14:45.985 --> 00:14:50.423
BIỂU BONTA FUNDAMENTALLY
WATCHING COURAGE MORE LIES YOUR

00:14:50.423 --> 00:14:52.925
MISSION CRITICAL FUNCTION AND
NOTHING LIKE MAJOR PRIORITY

00:14:52.925 --> 00:14:58.998
FOR CODIFIED IN THE LEGISLATURE
ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES MAY BE

00:14:58.998 --> 00:15:01.934
CHARGED LAST I THINK THAT WAS
PART OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT

00:15:01.934 --> 00:15:06.773
THE AGREEMENT WAS PURPOSELY
LEFT THE LEGISLATION LITTLE

00:15:08.207 --> 00:15:12.712
I UNDERSTAND YOU MORE BECAUSE

MAKING CODIFYING INDIVIDUAL

00:15:42.708 --> 00:15:45.611
REGULATIONS FOR INDIVIDUAL
CITIES I DON'T THINK THAT'S

00:15:45.611 --> 00:15:50.116
THE PURPOSE OF THIS COMMITTEE
SO POPULARIZED BY PROPOSITION

00:15:51.551 --> 00:15:54.053
