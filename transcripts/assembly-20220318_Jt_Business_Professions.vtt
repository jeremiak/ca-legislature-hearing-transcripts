MAN. AT LEAST REGIONALLY NURSING

00:11:05.197 --> 00:11:08.501
SHORTAGES AND I THINK ONE OF THE

00:11:08.567 --> 00:11:09.769
IMPEDIMENTS TO GETTING. THE

00:11:09.835 --> 00:11:13.506
NURSES OUT INTO PRACTICE IS- THE

00:11:13.572 --> 00:11:16.509
LACK OF CLINICAL SLOTS AND SO-

00:11:16.575 --> 00:11:19.645
PRIOR TO A. B. A TWENTY TWO

00:11:19.712 --> 00:11:21.680
EIGHTY EIGHT. I WAS WHICH I WAS

00:11:21.747 --> 00:11:24.116
A CO AUTHOR OF. OF BEER AND

00:11:24.183 --> 00:11:26.485
REGULATIONS ONLY ALLOWED. A

00:11:26.552 --> 00:11:29.321
NURSING SCHOOLS TO UTILIZE 25%

00:11:29.388 --> 00:11:31.524
OF- CLINICAL SIMULATION AS A

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:34.160
SUBSTITUTE FOR- FOR CLINICAL

00:11:34.226 --> 00:11:37.163
HOURS SO CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY

00:11:37.229 --> 00:11:39.465
THIS IS THE CASE AND- ARE YOU

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:41.233
TAKING STEPS TO CONSIDER MOVING

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:46.038
UP TO. A 50% LIKE MANY OTHER

00:11:46.105 --> 00:11:51.744
STATES THAT. THANK YOU. THANK

00:11:51.811 --> 00:11:53.946
YOU THIS IS- LORENA FOR

00:11:54.013 --> 00:11:55.514
EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND I'D LIKE

00:11:55.581 --> 00:11:56.982
TO ANSWER THAT THANK YOU FOR

00:11:57.049 --> 00:11:58.484
ASKING THAT ASSEMBLYMEMBER

00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:00.653
IRWIN- WE ARE DOING A LOT OF

00:12:00.719 --> 00:12:02.354
DIFFERENT THINGS AND WE ACTUALLY

00:12:02.421 --> 00:12:04.056
STARTED WITH READING LOOKING AT

00:12:04.123 --> 00:12:07.126
OUR REGULATION BACK REGULATION

00:12:07.193 --> 00:12:10.563
IN ALIGNMENT- FIGHT SELF IS NOT

00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:13.365
AFFECTED AND- I'M THE FIRST ONE

00:12:13.432 --> 00:12:15.568
TO ACTUALLY SAY THAT. SO WHEN

00:12:15.634 --> 00:12:16.669
YOU LOOK AT THAT REGULATION

00:12:16.735 --> 00:12:20.072
WHICH IS FOURTEEN SIXTY THREE

00:12:20.139 --> 00:12:21.874
SIXTEEN C. C. R. FOURTEEN TWENTY

00:12:21.941 --> 00:12:23.042
SIX STARTED WITH A NURSE RIGHT

00:12:23.109 --> 00:12:25.044
HERE AT THE BEGINNING BUT ALL

00:12:25.111 --> 00:12:26.679
WORK THROUGH THOSE- IT SAYS THAT

00:12:26.745 --> 00:12:29.315
YOU NEED EIGHTEEN SEMESTER UNITS

00:12:29.381 --> 00:12:32.952
IN NURSING CLINICAL- AND THEN

00:12:33.018 --> 00:12:34.954
THOSE SEMESTER UNITS ARE BASED

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:37.656
ON THE WEEK AND SO THERE'S NOT A

00:12:37.723 --> 00:12:40.926
STANDARD OUR NUMBER SO SOME

00:12:40.993 --> 00:12:43.596
SCHOOLS CHOOSE THREE OUT OF

00:12:43.662 --> 00:12:46.165
THREE UNIX IN PEDIATRICS SO 50%

00:12:46.232 --> 00:12:48.100
OF THAT WOULD BE A GOOD AND A

00:12:48.167 --> 00:12:49.135
HALF SOME SCHOOLS HAVE UNIT

00:12:49.201 --> 00:12:50.803
HAPPEN PEDIATRICS AND STUPID YOU

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.705
PERCENT OF THAT WOULD BE A POINT

00:12:52.771 --> 00:12:55.107
SEVEN FIVE CREDIT. SO WE DON'T

00:12:55.174 --> 00:12:57.643
HAVE A BASELINE SO WHEN YOU LOOK

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.578
AT THE END C-SPAN SIMULATION

00:12:59.645 --> 00:13:00.713
STUDY THAT WE'VE THEY'VE BEEN

00:13:00.779 --> 00:13:03.315
KIND OF PUSHING OUT FOR PROBABLY

00:13:03.382 --> 00:13:05.251
TEN YEARS NOW THE FIRST THING IT

00:13:05.317 --> 00:13:07.119
SAYS IS TO ESTABLISH A DIRECT

00:13:07.186 --> 00:13:08.120
PATIENT CARE CLINICAL

00:13:08.187 --> 00:13:09.955
REQUIREMENTS THAT'S WHAT OUR

00:13:10.022 --> 00:13:12.525
BOARD VOTED IN NOVEMBER TO DO SO

00:13:12.591 --> 00:13:18.631
IN NOVEMBER IN. A BOARD MEETING

00:13:18.697 --> 00:13:20.332
I EXPLAINED. IS THAT WE HAVE

00:13:20.399 --> 00:13:24.470
WITH. WITH THAT MINIMUM DIRECT

00:13:24.537 --> 00:13:26.805
PATIENT CARE THAT ALLOWS FOR THE

00:13:26.872 --> 00:13:29.742
SCHOOLS TO DO AS MUCH SIMULATION

00:13:29.808 --> 00:13:31.610
AS THEY CAN SUPPORT. IF THEY

00:13:31.677 --> 00:13:33.846
HAVE THE RESOURCES TO SUPPORT IT

00:13:33.913 --> 00:13:35.814
IF THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO

00:13:35.881 --> 00:13:37.416
SUPPORT THE FACULTY TO TEACH IT.

00:13:37.483 --> 00:13:39.685
THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO DO AS

00:13:39.752 --> 00:13:41.620
MUCH STIMULATION AS THEY WANT AS

00:13:41.687 --> 00:13:43.289
LONG AS THEY MEET THE MINIMUM

00:13:43.355 --> 00:13:45.524
DIRECT PATIENT CARE REQUIREMENTS

00:13:45.591 --> 00:13:48.027
. CALIFORNIA PLANS TO ALIGN WITH

00:13:48.093 --> 00:13:49.962
STATES LIKE WASHINGTON OREGON

00:13:50.029 --> 00:13:51.964
AND WASHINGTON. AND OTHERS WERE

00:13:52.031 --> 00:13:54.166
THEY HAVE MOVED AWAY FROM A

00:13:54.233 --> 00:13:56.869
SIMULATION PERCENTAGE AND

00:13:56.936 --> 00:13:59.104
LAUGHTER THAT TO THEIR DEANS AND

00:13:59.171 --> 00:14:00.606
DIRECTORS TO ESTABLISH WHAT

00:14:00.673 --> 00:14:02.741
WORKS BEST FOR THEM ACCORDING TO

00:14:02.808 --> 00:14:03.943
THEIR DEMOGRAPHIC THAT THEY

00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:06.245
SERVE. AND THE RESOURCES THAT

00:14:06.312 --> 00:14:09.481
THEY HAVE SO CALIFORNIA. UNTIL

00:14:09.548 --> 00:14:11.817
WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT AB

00:14:11.884 --> 00:14:12.418
TWENTY TWO EIGHTY EIGHT I'VE

00:14:12.484 --> 00:14:13.752
NEVER HAD ANYTHING IN THEIR

00:14:13.819 --> 00:14:15.120
STATUTE REGARDING SIMULATION OR

00:14:15.187 --> 00:14:16.355
EVEN IN THE REGULATIONS

00:14:16.422 --> 00:14:18.457
REGARDING SIMULATION. WE HAD

00:14:18.524 --> 00:14:20.059
NEVER HAD ANY AUTHORITY OVER

00:14:20.125 --> 00:14:22.461
THAT- WE ONLY HAD A BIRDIE THAT

00:14:22.528 --> 00:14:24.263
TALK TO THE DIRECT PATIENT CARE

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:25.731
REQUIREMENTS. SO WE WILL

00:14:25.798 --> 00:14:27.366
CONTINUE THAT PROCESS WE WILL

00:14:27.433 --> 00:14:30.169
SET A STANDARD DRINK. MINIMUM

00:14:30.236 --> 00:14:32.671
POWER REQUIREMENTS THIS YEAR IN

00:14:32.738 --> 00:14:34.340
REGULATION UNLESS YOU GUYS WANT

00:14:34.406 --> 00:14:35.908
TO ADD THAT AS PART OF OUR

00:14:35.975 --> 00:14:37.977
SUNSET BILL- AND WE WILL FOLLOW

00:14:38.043 --> 00:14:39.745
THAT AND ALLOW OUR DEANS AND

00:14:39.812 --> 00:14:41.647
DIRECTORS TO HAVE CARTE BLANCHE

00:14:41.714 --> 00:14:43.983
WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT THEY WANT

00:14:44.049 --> 00:14:44.583
TO DO WITH STIMULATION. WHAT

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:46.051
KIND OF RESOURCES THEY HAVE TO

00:14:46.118 --> 00:14:47.620
SUPPORT THAT AND WAS LONG AS A

00:14:47.686 --> 00:14:49.255
SERVICE TO DEMOGRAPHIC THE

00:14:49.321 --> 00:14:51.190
CABBIE OUGHT TO THAT IS WE DO

00:14:51.257 --> 00:14:53.259
APPROVE THE CURRICULUM. SO WE DO

00:14:53.325 --> 00:14:54.460
KNOW WHAT THE CLINICAL

00:14:54.526 --> 00:14:56.428
OBJECTIVES ARE IN PART OF OUR

00:14:56.495 --> 00:14:58.130
OVERSIGHT IS TO ENSURE THAT

00:14:58.197 --> 00:14:59.565
WHATEVER THEY DO OUTSIDE OF THE

00:14:59.632 --> 00:15:02.034
DIRECT PATIENT CARE. MANAGES TO

00:15:02.101 --> 00:15:03.369
PREPARE THOSE STUDENTS TO BE

00:15:03.435 --> 00:15:05.137
SAFE AND COMPETENT NURSES AFTER

00:15:05.204 --> 00:15:11.076
GRADUATION AND. MEETS THOSE

00:15:11.143 --> 00:15:11.710
CLINICAL PROJECT. OKAY YOU THAT

00:15:11.777 --> 00:15:13.712
SIR. SO WITH THE MINIMUM AND-

00:15:13.779 --> 00:15:16.081
DIRECT PATIENT CARE HOURS- THAT

00:15:16.148 --> 00:15:17.816
YOUR THAT YOU WERE LOOKING AT-

00:15:17.883 --> 00:15:20.619
THIS YEAR DO YOU THINK THAT

00:15:20.686 --> 00:15:21.720
THERE'S GOING TO BE AN INCREASE

00:15:21.787 --> 00:15:23.088
IN THE USE OF SIMULATION AND I

00:15:23.155 --> 00:15:24.423
JUST WANT TO SAY WE'VE- WE'VE-

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:28.527
LOOKED AT DATA. AND THAT THERE

00:15:28.594 --> 00:15:31.864
IS. A CLINICAL SIMULATION HAS

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:33.532
COME A REALLY LONG WAY AND IT

00:15:33.599 --> 00:15:35.167
SHOWED THE DATA SHOWS THAT IT

00:15:35.234 --> 00:15:36.669
INCREASES CRITICAL THINKING AND

00:15:36.735 --> 00:15:39.104
DECISION MAKING. AND AIDS IN A

00:15:39.171 --> 00:15:41.106
CROSS CULTURAL CARE SO DO YOU

00:15:41.173 --> 00:15:43.309
SEE IT YOU KNOW IT'S HARD FOR ME

00:15:43.375 --> 00:15:45.911
WHEN YOU SAY WE'VE TO SET OUR

00:15:45.978 --> 00:15:46.545
SETTING A MINIMUM STANDARD FOR

00:15:46.612 --> 00:15:48.781
DIRECT PATIENT CARE. DOES THAT

00:15:48.847 --> 00:15:52.318
MEAN DO YOU SEE. A AN INCREASE

00:15:52.384 --> 00:15:55.954
IN SIMULATION. I MEAN IS THAT

00:15:56.021 --> 00:15:56.555
ALL THE CABBIE OUTS THAT YOU

00:15:56.622 --> 00:15:59.658
HAVE PUT FORWARD. YEAH THERE ARE

00:15:59.725 --> 00:16:01.794
SCHOOLS THAT DO SIMULATION

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:02.895
REALLY WELL THEY HAVE THE

00:16:02.961 --> 00:16:04.630
RESOURCES THEY HAVE THE STAFF

00:16:04.697 --> 00:16:06.732
THEY HAVE THE FACILITIES THEY

00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:08.934
HAVE ACCESS TO EVERYTHING THOSE

00:16:09.001 --> 00:16:10.769
SCHOOLS WILL INCREASE IN

00:16:10.836 --> 00:16:12.571
SIMULATION BUT THE OTHER THING

00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:14.807
THAT THIS DOES WHICH IS KIND OF

00:16:14.873 --> 00:16:15.874
AN INTENSIVE UNINTENDED

00:16:15.941 --> 00:16:17.743
CONSEQUENCES WHICH IS ACTUALLY

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:19.812
NOT A CONSEQUENCE AT ALL. IS

00:16:19.878 --> 00:16:21.580
BECAUSE IT ESTABLISHES A MINIMUM

00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:23.882
DIRECT PATIENT CARE AND THE

00:16:23.949 --> 00:16:25.851
SCHOOLS DO NOT HAVE LIKE ONE OF

00:16:25.918 --> 00:16:27.720
THE EXAMPLES WE USED IS WE HAD A

00:16:27.786 --> 00:16:29.888
SCHOOL THAT HAD TWENTY FOUR

00:16:29.955 --> 00:16:31.690
UNITS THAT THEY WANTED TO USE IN

00:16:31.757 --> 00:16:33.158
CLINIC- SINCE THE EIGHTEEN UNITS

00:16:33.225 --> 00:16:34.860
THAT WERE REQUIRED. WHAT SIX

00:16:34.927 --> 00:16:36.528
ADDITIONAL UNITS OUT IN THE

00:16:36.595 --> 00:16:38.731
COMMUNITY BUT EACH ONE OF THEIR

00:16:38.797 --> 00:16:40.532
STUDENTS NEEDED TO OBTAIN IN

00:16:40.599 --> 00:16:42.434
ORDER TO GRADUATE THAT MEANT A

00:16:42.501 --> 00:16:44.236
LARGER STUDENT LOAN DEBT AND

00:16:44.303 --> 00:16:45.604
THAT MEANT MORE CLINICAL IN

00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:47.673
ACTION. SO WHEN WE SET THIS

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.041
MINIMUM STANDARD IT'S BEEN A

00:16:49.108 --> 00:16:50.943
WHOLE STUDENTS OUT OF THAT

00:16:51.009 --> 00:16:53.512
COMMUNITY DECREASE THE CLINICAL

00:16:53.579 --> 00:16:56.448
IMPACTION AND ALLOW FOR SCHOOLS

00:16:56.515 --> 00:16:58.016
TO HAVE AS MUCH CLINICAL-

00:16:58.083 --> 00:17:00.853
STIMULATION THAT THEY CHOOSE TO

00:17:00.919 --> 00:17:02.354
HAVE. YOUR REGARDLESS OF THE B.

00:17:02.421 --> 00:17:05.457
R. N. SO THAT THEY CAN EIGHTEEN

00:17:05.524 --> 00:17:07.626
FACULTY LOADS THEY CAN INCREASE

00:17:07.693 --> 00:17:09.962
THEIR SIMULATION THAT WILL BE UP

00:17:10.028 --> 00:17:11.697
TO THEM BECAUSE THERE IS A VAST

00:17:11.764 --> 00:17:13.632
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SIMULATIONS

00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:14.900
WE HAVE SOME. THAT ARE

00:17:14.967 --> 00:17:17.770
COMPUTERIZED HIM THERE ARE SOME

00:17:17.836 --> 00:17:19.738
THAT ARE HIGH FIDELITY STEM

00:17:19.805 --> 00:17:20.539
SUMMER EVEN DOING VIRTUAL

00:17:20.606 --> 00:17:22.908
REALITY SO AS LONG AS THEY MEET

00:17:22.975 --> 00:17:24.543
THE GRADUATE OUTCOMES IN THE

00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:26.745
CLINICAL OUTCOMES I THINK OUR

00:17:26.812 --> 00:17:28.614
PROGRAMS WERE ABSOLUTELY STEP UP

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.416
AND USE THAT AND IT WILL

00:17:30.482 --> 00:17:32.017
ACTUALLY WORK TO. EFFECTIVELY

00:17:32.084 --> 00:17:34.520
DECREASING CLINICAL IMPACTION

00:17:34.586 --> 00:17:36.922
AND YOU'RE RIGHT- HI WHEN I WAS

00:17:36.989 --> 00:17:38.557
IN MY DOCTOR'S PREPAY ONLY

00:17:38.624 --> 00:17:39.925
COMPLETED ONE YEAR HAVEN'T

00:17:39.992 --> 00:17:41.860
PLAYED IT YET ONE OF MY

00:17:41.927 --> 00:17:44.463
ORIGINAL- POINTS OF LOOKING AT

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:45.831
WAS SIMULATION AND I ACTUALLY

00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:48.834
SERVED- UNDER KT WAXMAN IN BY

00:17:48.901 --> 00:17:50.569
JUST GOING TO ALL OF OUR CLASSES

00:17:50.636 --> 00:17:52.037
HE WAS. REALLY ON THE FOREFRONT

00:17:52.104 --> 00:17:53.806
OF DEVELOPING SIMULATION SO I

00:17:53.872 --> 00:17:56.141
HAVE A HUGE TRUST OF SIMULATION

00:17:56.208 --> 00:18:02.381
AND I. TRULY BELIEVE THAT IT IS

00:18:02.448 --> 00:18:04.650
A GREAT ADS TO THE PATIENT. SO

00:18:04.716 --> 00:18:06.118
WE ARE NEED KIND OF STAY THERE

00:18:06.185 --> 00:18:07.286
THEIR OWN BROWN WE SET THE SCENE

00:18:07.352 --> 00:18:09.054
FOR MEN DIRECT. CARE AND LET THE

00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:10.489
SCHOOLS WITH THEIR DEANS AND

00:18:10.556 --> 00:18:11.290
DIRECTORS PARTNERING WITH THEIR

00:18:11.356 --> 00:18:13.859
SIMULATION EXPERTS DEVELOP

00:18:13.926 --> 00:18:15.894
WHAT'S BEST FOR THEM. THANK YOU

00:18:15.961 --> 00:18:17.729
AND THEN- ONE OTHER THING ON THE

00:18:17.796 --> 00:18:20.632
NOTE OF FLEXIBILITY RIGHT. B. R.

00:18:20.699 --> 00:18:22.000
AND REGULATIONS REQUIRE

00:18:22.067 --> 00:18:24.937
CONCURRENCE BETWEEN- THEORY AND

00:18:25.003 --> 00:18:27.172
CLINICALS. AND HAS THERE BEEN

00:18:27.239 --> 00:18:30.342
SOME THOUGHT ABOUT ALLOWING- THE

00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:34.179
THEORY TO BE TAKEN FIRST BEFORE

00:18:34.246 --> 00:18:35.347
YOU DO CLINICALS JUST. SO YOU

00:18:35.414 --> 00:18:39.117
DON'T DEAL WITH- BOTTLENECKS IN-

00:18:39.184 --> 00:18:42.754
AND- PUTTING PATIENTS OUT ART OR

00:18:42.821 --> 00:18:45.257
A PUTTING IT AHEAD. MOVING

00:18:45.324 --> 00:18:47.793
THROUGH THE SYSTEM I SHOULD SAY

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:49.294
. SO I GUESS I'LL ANSWER THAT IN

00:18:49.361 --> 00:18:51.196
A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS THOUGH

00:18:51.263 --> 00:18:53.632
SO THE FIRST ONE IS THEY HAVE

00:18:53.699 --> 00:18:55.601
COMPLETE AUTONOMY WITHIN THEIR

00:18:55.667 --> 00:18:59.171
CURRENT SEMESTER RIGHT NOW TO DO

00:18:59.238 --> 00:19:00.772
THAT CLINICAL INFERI SCHEDULING.

00:19:00.839 --> 00:19:02.140
SO IF THEY HAVE A SIXTEEN WEEK

00:19:02.207 --> 00:19:04.209
SEMESTER AND THEY WANT TO FOCUS

00:19:04.276 --> 00:19:05.744
THE FIRST EIGHT WEEKS ON THIRD.

00:19:05.811 --> 00:19:07.246
AND THEN GO THE FINAL EIGHT

00:19:07.312 --> 00:19:08.881
WEEKS INTO SIMULATION THAT'S

00:19:08.947 --> 00:19:11.083
ABSOLUTELY ACCEPTABLE CURRENTLY

00:19:11.149 --> 00:19:12.751
WITHIN OUR REGULATIONS AND

00:19:12.818 --> 00:19:14.086
SOMETHING THAT WE ENCOURAGE WHEN

00:19:14.152 --> 00:19:14.953
YOU'RE DEALING WITH SCHEDULING

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:16.655
DIFFICULTIES THERE ARE SOME

00:19:16.722 --> 00:19:18.857
PROGRAMS THAT ACTUALLY DO A TWO

00:19:18.924 --> 00:19:20.959
DAY INTENSIVE BOOT CAMP THE

00:19:21.026 --> 00:19:21.660
FIRST COUPLE DAYS OF THE

00:19:21.727 --> 00:19:24.296
SEMESTER AND THEN THEY GO INTO

00:19:24.363 --> 00:19:26.231
CLINICALS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT

00:19:26.298 --> 00:19:28.634
AND ROTATE PEOPLE THROUGH ON A

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.870
GROUP LIKE BASIS. WE ARE IN

00:19:31.937 --> 00:19:33.105
COMPLETE SUPPORT WITH THAT SO

00:19:33.171 --> 00:19:35.874
THAT FLEXIBILITY IS THERE AND IS

00:19:35.941 --> 00:19:38.777
ENCOURAGED WE ALSO HAVE- A KEY

00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:40.345
GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT ARE WE AND

00:19:40.412 --> 00:19:42.080
RICHER AND HE SEES THAT WORK

00:19:42.147 --> 00:19:43.982
WITH THESE PROGRAMS SPECIFICALLY

00:19:44.049 --> 00:19:45.584
AND IF THEY DO COME ACROSS A

00:19:45.651 --> 00:19:47.185
TIME WHERE THEY SAY HEY I HAVE

00:19:47.252 --> 00:19:48.887
FIVE STUDENTS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN

00:19:48.954 --> 00:19:49.988
ABLE TO FINISH THEIR CLINICALS

00:19:50.055 --> 00:19:51.857
WITHIN THE SEMESTER. WE'RE GOING

00:19:51.924 --> 00:19:53.725
TO HAVE TO WORK WITH THEM TO

00:19:53.792 --> 00:19:55.294
WRAP THAT UP THE NEC'S WORK WITH

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.728
THEM THE PROGRAM GIVES THEM AN

00:19:56.795 --> 00:19:58.363
INCOMPLETE THAT ALLOW SOME

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:00.098
FOURTEEN ADDITIONAL DAYS POST

00:20:00.165 --> 00:20:01.466
THIS SEMESTER TO CLEAR UP THOSE

00:20:01.533 --> 00:20:03.335
HOURS THEY CLEAR THOSE HOURS

00:20:03.402 --> 00:20:08.507
AFTER THEY MOVE ON TO THE NEXT

00:20:08.574 --> 00:20:09.741
SEMESTER. THE THING IS THE OLD.

00:20:09.808 --> 00:20:11.843
WHICH TO ME. THOSE HOURS INTO

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:14.446
THE NEXT THE MASTER THAT I

00:20:14.513 --> 00:20:16.114
TALKED ABOUT IN OUR SENSE OF

00:20:16.181 --> 00:20:17.749
HEARING NUMBER TWO LAST YEAR IN

00:20:17.816 --> 00:20:21.019
MAY. THAT IS TRULY AN ALLERGY I

00:20:21.086 --> 00:20:23.255
USED AT THAT POINT THE BAD PAID

00:20:23.322 --> 00:20:24.923
A MONTH BECAUSE YOU HAVE

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:26.758
CLINICAL HOURS YOU HAVE TO BE IN

00:20:26.825 --> 00:20:27.392
THAT NEXT SEMESTER. SO YOU END

00:20:27.459 --> 00:20:29.428
UP BEHIND THE EIGHT BALL GOING

00:20:29.494 --> 00:20:31.663
INTO THAT NEXT SEMESTER.

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:33.031
INUNDATING THE CLINICAL SITES

00:20:33.098 --> 00:20:34.333
THAT YOU'RE ALREADY USING FOR

00:20:34.399 --> 00:20:35.968
THAT NEXT SEMESTER TO SCHEDULE

00:20:36.034 --> 00:20:37.769
YOUR CLINICALS ARE NEEDED BAD.

00:20:37.836 --> 00:20:39.638
AND JUST LIKE TRYING TO MAKE UP

00:20:39.705 --> 00:20:41.406
THE REMAINING CLINICAL HOURS

00:20:41.473 --> 00:20:43.609
FROM THE SEMESTER BEFORE. THAT

00:20:43.675 --> 00:20:45.944
YOU WEREN'T ABLE TO COMPLETE. SO

00:20:46.011 --> 00:20:48.847
THAT FROM A SCHEDULING BASIS AND

00:20:48.914 --> 00:20:50.983
IT IMPACTED THE COMMUNITY IS

00:20:51.049 --> 00:20:54.886
REALLY NOT AN EFFECTIVE PROCESS

00:20:54.953 --> 00:20:57.889
. WHY WE ALSO HAVE EVIDENCE AS

00:20:57.956 --> 00:20:59.958
TO WHY IT IS IMPERATIVE TO DO

00:21:00.025 --> 00:21:01.793
THEORY AND CLINICAL CONCURRENT

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.762
WHEN YOU'RE I THE CLASSROOM AND

00:21:03.829 --> 00:21:04.796
YOU'RE TEACHING A SUBJECT CAN

00:21:04.863 --> 00:21:07.733
YOU TALK ABOUT- HOLD PERSON

00:21:07.799 --> 00:21:09.835
STEPPED AWAY ARE YOU TALK ABOUT-

00:21:09.901 --> 00:21:12.838
TWO TROLLEY OF HELLO AND YOU

00:21:12.904 --> 00:21:13.939
DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO SEE

00:21:14.006 --> 00:21:15.741
THAT IN THE CLINICAL SETTING OR

00:21:15.807 --> 00:21:18.710
PRACTICE THAT IN A SIMULATION-

00:21:18.777 --> 00:21:21.046
YOU KIND YOU KIND OF LOSE IT AND

00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:23.081
SO YOU NEED TO HAVE THAT THEORY

00:21:23.148 --> 00:21:24.916
WHERE THEY TALK ABOUT WHAT'S

00:21:24.983 --> 00:21:26.918
GOING ON GO TO THE CLINICAL

00:21:26.985 --> 00:21:27.853
SETTING. LET YOUR CLINICAL

00:21:27.919 --> 00:21:29.821
PARTNER SAY HEY MY STUDENTS ARE

00:21:29.888 --> 00:21:31.923
LEARNING ABOUT CARDIAC RIGHT NOW

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:33.425
CAN YOU GIVE ME ANY CARDIAC

00:21:33.492 --> 00:21:36.928
PATIENTS WE WANT OBSERVE WE WANT

00:21:36.995 --> 00:21:37.963
TO PARTICIPATE THEY SEE THINGS

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:40.232
IN REAL LIFE BECAUSE AS WE KNOW

00:21:40.298 --> 00:21:42.501
EVERY PERSON IS DIFFERENT BIG

00:21:42.567 --> 00:21:44.169
OUR EXPERIENCE THAT THEY BRING

00:21:44.236 --> 00:21:45.504
THOSE QUESTIONS BACK TO THE

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:46.538
THEORY INSTRUCT THE NEXT WEEK

00:21:46.605 --> 00:21:48.507
AND SAY THIS IS WHAT I SAW ON

00:21:48.573 --> 00:21:50.075
CLINICAL THAT'S NOT WHAT I HEARD

00:21:50.142 --> 00:21:51.309
IN THEORY MAKE HAT MAKES SENSE

00:21:51.376 --> 00:21:53.545
FOR ME AND THEY USE THAT ON A

00:21:53.612 --> 00:21:55.147
SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP FOR

00:21:55.213 --> 00:21:57.716
FEEDBACK AND SO IT IS

00:21:57.783 --> 00:22:00.052
IMPERATIVE. THAT THEY HAVE THOSE

00:22:00.118 --> 00:22:01.953
REALLY CLOSE TOGETHER AND THAT

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:03.522
IS WHY WE HAVE THIS CONCURRENCY

00:22:03.588 --> 00:22:05.190
REQUIREMENTS IT'S REALLY TO AID

00:22:05.257 --> 00:22:07.325
AND THEN BEING ABLE TO LEARN

00:22:07.392 --> 00:22:09.861
THAT CONTACT CONTACT SEE IT IN

00:22:09.928 --> 00:22:12.431
ACTION BRING QUESTIONS BACK AND

00:22:12.497 --> 00:22:13.932
REALLY HAVE THAT EMBEDDED IN

00:22:13.999 --> 00:22:15.934
THEIR KNOWLEDGE THEIR NOT HAVING

00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:17.135
TO GUESS WHEN THEY'RE TAKING

00:22:17.202 --> 00:22:19.071
CARE OF A PATIENT LATER ON THAT

00:22:19.137 --> 00:22:23.809
THEY MIGHT NOT. HAVE SEEN IT

00:22:23.875 --> 00:22:25.610
EXPOSED TO. SO I GUESS I'D HAVE

00:22:25.677 --> 00:22:26.912
ONE WAY QUESTION ALONG THOSE

00:22:26.978 --> 00:22:28.246
HAVE YOU SEEN DATA THAT IT'S

00:22:28.313 --> 00:22:29.281
MORE EFFECTIVE TO DO THAT WAY.

00:22:29.347 --> 00:22:31.616
TO DO IT THAT WAY BECAUSE

00:22:31.683 --> 00:22:32.284
CERTAINLY THERE ARE OTHER

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:34.119
HEALING ARTS LIKE A MEDICINE AND

00:22:34.186 --> 00:22:35.954
PHYSICAL THERAPY WHICH REQUIRE-

00:22:36.021 --> 00:22:38.023
THE THEORY BE TAUGHT. BEFORE THE

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:41.026
CLINICAL. YEAH THERE IS DATA

00:22:41.093 --> 00:22:44.763
THAT THERE IS THERE'S- THERE'S-

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:47.466
A LOT OF DATA RIGHT BEFORE- THE

00:22:47.532 --> 00:22:49.000
COLD OUTBREAK THAT REALLY KIND

00:22:49.067 --> 00:22:50.235
OF TALKED ABOUT THE THEORY

00:22:50.302 --> 00:22:52.237
PRACTICE GAP AND THEY TALKED

00:22:52.304 --> 00:22:55.006
ABOUT HOW EDUCATION AKADEMI ARE

00:22:55.073 --> 00:22:56.108
PREPARING THE STUDENTS FOR

00:22:56.174 --> 00:22:57.976
PRACTICE YET WHEN THE PRACTICE

00:22:58.043 --> 00:23:00.512
SETTING REACHES THEM OUR HIRES

00:23:00.579 --> 00:23:02.314
THEM THEY'RE NOT READY. AND SO

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.549
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT-

00:23:04.616 --> 00:23:07.819
INCREASINGNEW GRAD PROGRAMS WAY

00:23:07.886 --> 00:23:09.454
BACK WAY WAY BACK WHEN I BECAME

00:23:09.521 --> 00:23:11.590
A NURSE TWENTY SOME YEARS AGO WE

00:23:11.656 --> 00:23:15.193
WERE DOING SIX WEEK- NEW GRAD

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:16.995
PROGRAMS. BAND WHEN I WAS A

00:23:17.062 --> 00:23:18.964
CLINICAL EDUCATOR AT THE BEDSIDE

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:20.031
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT INCREASING

00:23:20.098 --> 00:23:22.534
THE SIX MONTHS ENDING MAYBE EVEN

00:23:22.601 --> 00:23:24.503
A YEAR TO REALLY GET OUR NURSES

00:23:24.569 --> 00:23:26.138
SUPPORTED BECAUSE THERE'S SO

00:23:26.204 --> 00:23:27.639
MUCH TO JUST STICKS OUT THERE.

00:23:27.706 --> 00:23:29.975
THAT TALK ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF

00:23:30.041 --> 00:23:31.676
ACCIDENTS THAT WE HAVE OF NURSES

00:23:31.743 --> 00:23:33.979
ENTER PRACTICE WITHIN TWO YEARS

00:23:34.045 --> 00:23:35.213
SO WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.314
WORK FORCE SHORTAGE YOU'RE

00:23:36.381 --> 00:23:38.617
LOOKING AT THE HIGH POINT OF

00:23:38.683 --> 00:23:39.684
NURSES. IT'S MORE THAN JUST

00:23:39.751 --> 00:23:41.620
PUTTING THEM THROUGH SCHOOL AND

00:23:41.686 --> 00:23:42.687
GETTING THEM TO PASS THE AND

00:23:42.754 --> 00:23:44.055
PLAQUES IT'S PUTTING THEM

00:23:44.122 --> 00:23:45.657
THROUGH SCHOOL GETTING THE PASS

00:23:45.724 --> 00:23:47.659
AND PLAQUE. AND COLLECTS MAKING

00:23:47.726 --> 00:23:49.561
SURE THEY'RE SUPPORTED SO THAT

00:23:49.628 --> 00:23:51.863
WHEN THEY'RE TWO YEARS DOWN THE

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:52.430
ROAD YOU DECIDE TO STAY IN

00:23:52.497 --> 00:23:55.033
NURSING. THEY DECIDED TO STAY

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:56.835
AND TAKE CARE OF THE REASONS

00:23:56.902 --> 00:23:58.470
THAT THEY WERE PREPARED TO DO

00:23:58.537 --> 00:24:00.105
THE WORST JUST SERVICE THAT WE

00:24:00.172 --> 00:24:02.240
DO IS PREPARE THESE STUDENTS IN

00:24:02.307 --> 00:24:04.209
ADEQUATELY. PUT THEM INTO THE

00:24:04.276 --> 00:24:06.645
WORK FORCE DO NOT SUPPORT THEM

00:24:06.711 --> 00:24:08.947
AND WITH THEIR JOB ASPIRATION IS

00:24:09.014 --> 00:24:11.082
BAD WITH THEIR LIFE GOALS BAND

00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:12.350
FOR ALL OF THEIR YEARS THEY

00:24:12.417 --> 00:24:14.553
DECIDEYOU KNOW WHAT NO THIS IS

00:24:14.619 --> 00:24:16.054
NOT RIGHT FOR ME. AND THAT'S

00:24:16.121 --> 00:24:17.255
WHERE WE REALLY NEED TO TAKE A

00:24:17.322 --> 00:24:19.424
LOOK AT THAT SO YEAH THERE'S

00:24:19.491 --> 00:24:20.892
ABSOLUTELY EVIDENCE THAT SHOWS

00:24:20.959 --> 00:24:23.762
THAT TIS WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE

00:24:23.829 --> 00:24:25.764
IT STARTED WAY WAY WAY BACK WHEN

00:24:25.831 --> 00:24:27.332
WE WERE DOING DIPLOMA PROGRAMS

00:24:27.399 --> 00:24:28.567
AND THEY WOULD GO TO SCHOOL IN

00:24:28.633 --> 00:24:30.735
THE MORNING. AND THEY WOULD GO

00:24:30.802 --> 00:24:31.703
INTO THE CLINICAL PRACTICE THAT

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:33.872
EVENING AND BY THE TIME THEY

00:24:33.939 --> 00:24:34.439
GRADUATED SCHOOL THEY WERE

00:24:34.506 --> 00:24:35.574
RUNNING THE NURSING FLOOR

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.742
BECAUSE THEY WERE EACH SEEING

00:24:37.809 --> 00:24:38.610
EVERYTHING PARTICIPATING IN

00:24:38.677 --> 00:24:40.011
EVERYTHING. IN THE NURSING

00:24:40.078 --> 00:24:42.647
STUDENTS KNOW THAT WITHIN THAT

00:24:42.714 --> 00:24:44.649
FIRST YEAR THEY'RE DOING A TON

00:24:44.716 --> 00:24:46.384
OF ON THE JOB TRAINING BECAUSE

00:24:46.451 --> 00:24:48.153
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS THEY

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:50.055
NEEDED TO SEE IT IN PRACTICE.

00:24:50.121 --> 00:24:51.623
THEY NEEDED TO BE HANDS ON THEY

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:53.491
NEEDED TO TOUCH THE PATIENT THEY

00:24:53.558 --> 00:24:54.125
NEED TO DISPEL PATIENTS SEE THE

00:24:54.192 --> 00:24:56.728
PATIENT WATCH THE BLANKS BE ABLE

00:24:56.795 --> 00:25:03.702
TO USE. ALL OF THEIR ASSESSMENT

00:25:03.768 --> 00:25:04.336
ABILITIES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:25:04.402 --> 00:25:05.237
THANK YOU. IRWIN MAYBE I COULD

00:25:05.303 --> 00:25:07.973
JUST- ASK CLARIFY QUESTION

00:25:08.039 --> 00:25:08.607
BEFORE I GO TO. THE DOCTOR PAN

00:25:08.673 --> 00:25:10.475
EXCELLENT QUESTIONS- MA'AM YOU

00:25:10.542 --> 00:25:12.711
USE THE NUMBER- OR THE PHRASE

00:25:12.777 --> 00:25:14.012
MINIMUM DIRECT PATIENT CARE WHAT

00:25:14.079 --> 00:25:16.481
IS THE NUMBER THAT'S ATTACHED TO

00:25:16.548 --> 00:25:21.353
THAT. THANK YOU SO WE HAVE A NEW

00:25:21.419 --> 00:25:23.955
ACTIVITY WE DID IT RELYING ON

00:25:24.022 --> 00:25:26.024
THEM THIS LAST NOVEMBER AND

00:25:26.091 --> 00:25:27.058
THEY'RE PLANNING ON HAVING THEIR

00:25:27.125 --> 00:25:29.094
FIRST MEETING THIS APRIL TO

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:31.763
REALLY LOOK AT THAT DATA. BUT

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:34.866
OREGON AT WASHINGTON DC THEY'RE

00:25:34.933 --> 00:25:36.301
GIVING US A RANGE FROM AND

00:25:36.368 --> 00:25:38.670
C-SPAN THEY SAID ANYWHERE FROM

00:25:38.737 --> 00:25:40.538
FIVE HUNDRED AND ONE TO SEVEN

00:25:40.605 --> 00:25:42.674
HUNDRED AND FIFTY WE LOOKED AT

00:25:42.741 --> 00:25:44.042
HAWAII'S DATA HAWAII STATUS AS

00:25:44.109 --> 00:25:46.578
ONE THOUSAND- HOWEVER WHEN YOU

00:25:46.645 --> 00:25:48.146
LOOK AT THE SIMULATION REPORT

00:25:48.213 --> 00:25:50.849
THAT NCS. PUT OUT BASS SAID

00:25:50.916 --> 00:25:53.385
MINIMUM DIRECT PATIENT CARE OF

00:25:53.451 --> 00:25:56.221
SIX HUNDRED. AND SO WHEN WE'RE

00:25:56.288 --> 00:25:58.123
LOOKING AT THE NATIONAL COUNCIL

00:25:58.189 --> 00:25:59.658
ST BERNARD'S STATUS. A

00:25:59.724 --> 00:26:00.959
SIMULATION STUDY THAT THEY'D

00:26:01.026 --> 00:26:03.061
STARTED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN REACT

00:26:03.128 --> 00:26:05.263
AGAIN IN TWENTY NINETEEN THEY'RE

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:07.198
RECOMMENDING SIX HUNDRED HOURS

00:26:07.265 --> 00:26:09.868
AS B. DIRECT PATIENT CARE THAT

00:26:09.935 --> 00:26:13.071
IS AFFECTED YOU 550% UP. SO WE

00:26:13.138 --> 00:26:15.874
CAN LOOK ANYWHERE BETWEEN THREE

00:26:15.941 --> 00:26:17.242
HUNDRED AND FIVE HUNDRED INDIAN

00:26:17.309 --> 00:26:19.077
ALIGNMENT WITH ALL THE OTHER

00:26:19.144 --> 00:26:20.245
WORDS VERSES THAT ARE GOING IN

00:26:20.312 --> 00:26:21.947
THIS DIRECTION. AND WHAT DOES

00:26:22.013 --> 00:26:23.181
WHAT DOES THAT REPRESENT IN

00:26:23.248 --> 00:26:29.020
TERMS OF THE TYPE. OF ISSUE OR

00:26:29.087 --> 00:26:30.588
TWO ABOUT HOURS RIGHT. YEAH WE

00:26:30.655 --> 00:26:32.123
ARE TALK ABOUT OURS AND I HE IS

00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:33.258
AN EXAM. CURRENT CURRENTLY WHEN

00:26:33.325 --> 00:26:35.760
WE DO 75% IF IT'S AN EIGHTEEN

00:26:35.827 --> 00:26:37.829
UNIT THE MASTER PORTAL CLINICALS

00:26:37.896 --> 00:26:40.532
AND IT LASTS FOR EIGHTY SIXTEEN

00:26:40.598 --> 00:26:42.033
WEEKS BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S THE

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:43.935
BACK CALCULATION THAT'S IN OUR

00:26:44.002 --> 00:26:44.569
REGULATIONS AND I'M TELLING YOU

00:26:44.636 --> 00:26:47.839
IT'S A PROBLEM- BASED ON THE

00:26:47.906 --> 00:26:49.407
WEEKS OF THE SEMESTER SO IF YOU

00:26:49.474 --> 00:26:50.342
HAVE AN- EIGHTEEN WEEK SEMESTER.

00:26:50.408 --> 00:26:52.444
YOU HAVE MORE HOURS AND SIXTEEN

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:53.478
WEEK SEMESTER YOU HAVE LESS

00:26:53.545 --> 00:26:55.814
HOURS AND SO BASED ON AN

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:56.748
EIGHTEEN YEAR NEXT SEMESTER

00:26:56.815 --> 00:26:58.984
CALCULATION BACK IS SIXTEEN

00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:01.319
WEEKS WHICH IS THE TYPICAL BILL

00:27:01.386 --> 00:27:02.954
THAT. YOU'RE LOOKING AT SIX

00:27:03.021 --> 00:27:04.556
HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR HOURS AND

00:27:04.622 --> 00:27:06.591
THAT'S WITH THE SEVENTY FIVE

00:27:06.658 --> 00:27:09.361
PERCENT. WE THEN IT GOES LOWER

00:27:09.427 --> 00:27:11.029
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FIRST

00:27:11.096 --> 00:27:12.864
NURSING COURSE THAT IS TEACHING

00:27:12.931 --> 00:27:15.800
BASIC SKILLS WE ALLOW 1100% TO

00:27:15.867 --> 00:27:18.536
BE DONE IN A SIMULATION LAB. SO

00:27:18.603 --> 00:27:21.573
WE'RE RIGHT THERE- AND I THINK

00:27:21.639 --> 00:27:23.908
THAT WE CAN MOVE THAT. THAT

00:27:23.975 --> 00:27:26.411
EASILY SAID BETWEEN THREE

00:27:26.478 --> 00:27:27.679
HUNDRED AND FIVE HUNDRED BASED

00:27:27.746 --> 00:27:30.348
ON THE DATA AND I EXPECT THAT I

00:27:30.415 --> 00:27:32.050
CAN EITHER PULL THAT FOR YOU

00:27:32.117 --> 00:27:33.084
GUYS IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT

00:27:33.151 --> 00:27:34.686
GETTING THAT INTO THE SUNSET

00:27:34.753 --> 00:27:36.454
REPORT WHICH I WOULD SUPPORT

00:27:36.521 --> 00:27:37.355
GREATLY BECAUSE THAT WOULD.

00:27:37.422 --> 00:27:38.590
ALLOW US TO IMPLEMENT

00:27:38.656 --> 00:27:40.792
IMMEDIATELY BURST IS GOING TO

00:27:40.859 --> 00:27:42.060
READ TO YOUR PROCESS TO UPDATE

00:27:42.127 --> 00:27:44.095
OUR REGULATIONS WHICH WE WOULD

00:27:44.162 --> 00:27:46.498
GET TO BUT IT WOULD HAVE A

00:27:46.564 --> 00:27:47.599
DELAYED EFFECT SO THAT'S

00:27:47.665 --> 00:27:49.267
SOMETHING THAT I CAN HOLD A-

00:27:49.334 --> 00:27:51.102
EVIDENCE FOR AND GIVE THAT TO

00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:53.238
YOU AND PROVIDE THAT TO YOU I'D

00:27:53.304 --> 00:27:54.372
BE HAPPY TO DO THAT. WELL I'M

00:27:54.439 --> 00:27:57.008
JUST WHEN YOU SAY SCHOOLS ARE

00:27:57.075 --> 00:28:01.579
FREE TO DO AS MUCH CLINICAL.

00:28:01.646 --> 00:28:03.114
SIMULATION AS THEY- C. FIT TO DO

00:28:03.181 --> 00:28:04.616
. CAN HANDLE OR TO DO I'M JUST

00:28:04.682 --> 00:28:06.184
TRY TO FIGURE OUT. THE VAL OF

00:28:06.251 --> 00:28:08.753
THAT DEPENDS ON. WHAT PERCENTAGE

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:10.822
MINIMUM DIRECT PATIENT CARE IS

00:28:10.889 --> 00:28:11.956
OF THE TOTAL HOURS IN THE

00:28:12.023 --> 00:28:15.493
PROGRAM SO. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:15.994
SIX HUNDRED HOURS WHAT

00:28:16.061 --> 00:28:18.730
PERCENTAGE. DOES THAT REPRESENT

00:28:18.797 --> 00:28:20.965
OF THE TOTAL TEACHING HOURS IN

00:28:21.032 --> 00:28:24.803
THE NURSING PROGRAM. IS THAT A

00:28:24.869 --> 00:28:26.805
FAIR QUESTION IF. IS ALL RIGHT

00:28:26.871 --> 00:28:29.307
WELL LET ME LET ME JUST SO IS IT

00:28:29.374 --> 00:28:30.909
SIX HUNDRED HOURS OUT OF A

00:28:30.975 --> 00:28:32.143
THOUSAND WHICH ALLOWS THE

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:34.045
TRAINING PROGRAM TO. UTILIZE

00:28:34.112 --> 00:28:36.614
CLINICAL SIMULATION FOR FOUR

00:28:36.681 --> 00:28:38.817
HUNDRED HOURS IS IT SIX HUNDRED

00:28:38.883 --> 00:28:40.318
HOURS YEAH. SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLAR

00:28:40.385 --> 00:28:42.153
PROGRAM WHICH ALLOWS FOR ONE

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:43.221
HUNDRED HOURS OF CLINICAL

00:28:43.288 --> 00:28:45.023
SIMULATION I WAS TRYING TO GET A

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:46.291
FEEL FOR WHAT WE'RE TALKING

00:28:46.357 --> 00:28:47.859
ABOUT HERE AND- YOU REMEMBER

00:28:47.926 --> 00:28:49.561
YOUR DATE DEALING WITH THE

00:28:49.627 --> 00:28:51.262
GERIATRIC SET WHEN YOU DEAL WITH

00:28:51.329 --> 00:28:53.998
ME SO. WELL THAT'S GREAT BECAUSE

00:28:54.065 --> 00:28:55.333
I'M TRAINED IN GERIATRICS AS

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:57.102
WELL SO WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO

00:28:57.168 --> 00:29:00.004
THIS. SO CENTER OUT THAT'S A

00:29:00.071 --> 00:29:02.207
GREAT QUESTION WHAT THE NCS AND

00:29:02.273 --> 00:29:03.441
THE NATIONAL COUNCIL STATE

00:29:03.508 --> 00:29:06.411
BOARDS OF NURSING STUDY SHOWS IS

00:29:06.478 --> 00:29:07.312
SIX HUNDRED IS THAT DIRECT

00:29:07.378 --> 00:29:09.180
PATIENT CARE ANYTHING TO FIFTY

00:29:09.247 --> 00:29:11.316
PERCENT. AND STILL BE EVIDENCE

00:29:11.382 --> 00:29:13.918
SAYS THE MINIMUM STANDARD WOULD

00:29:13.985 --> 00:29:16.588
BE THREE HUNDRED HOURS AND THEN

00:29:16.654 --> 00:29:18.990
PROGRAMS CAN DO IT. JUST NOT

00:29:19.057 --> 00:29:20.291
THREE HUNDRED ON TOP OF THAT.

00:29:20.358 --> 00:29:22.660
AND THAT WOULD BE ADEQUATELY

00:29:22.727 --> 00:29:27.031
PREPARED NURSING STUDENT FOUR B.

00:29:27.098 --> 00:29:30.969
THE FIELD. SO FOR THAT I SHOW

00:29:31.035 --> 00:29:32.637
THAT 50% CAN BE MAYBE CLINICAL

00:29:32.704 --> 00:29:34.139
SIMULATION IF YOU'RE ABLE TO DO

00:29:34.205 --> 00:29:36.674
IT. IT COULD BE SIMULATION BUT

00:29:36.741 --> 00:29:37.475
REMEMBER OUR REGULATIONS RIGHT

00:29:37.542 --> 00:29:39.944
NOW ONLY SPEAK TO THE DIRECT

00:29:40.011 --> 00:29:42.647
PATIENT CARE IT SAYS WITH THE

00:29:42.714 --> 00:29:43.815
EXCEPTION OF THE FIRST COURSE

00:29:43.882 --> 00:29:46.050
THAT CAN BE A HUNDRED PERCENT.

00:29:46.117 --> 00:29:47.785
THE REMAINING COURSES MUST HAVE

00:29:47.852 --> 00:29:49.087
MISSED MUCH IN DIRECT PATIENT

00:29:49.154 --> 00:29:52.056
CARE THAT ALLOWS THE SCHOOL TO

00:29:52.123 --> 00:29:55.960
DO OBSERVATION. CASE STUDIES-

00:29:56.027 --> 00:29:58.696
VOLUNTEER WORK AND ADD TO IT

00:29:58.763 --> 00:30:00.398
INCLUDING SIMULATION IF THEY

00:30:00.465 --> 00:30:03.001
HAVE THE MEANS TO DO THAT. TO

00:30:03.067 --> 00:30:04.736
REALLY HAVE THOSE STUDENTS BE

00:30:04.802 --> 00:30:07.138
ABLE TO MEET. EIGHT CLINICAL

00:30:07.205 --> 00:30:10.742
OUTCOMES SO PULLING AWAY FROM A

00:30:10.808 --> 00:30:13.645
PERCENTAGE IS REALLY THE- THE

00:30:13.711 --> 00:30:15.947
RIGHT WAY TO GO IN THE WAY THAT

00:30:16.014 --> 00:30:17.115
OUR BOARD VOTED. TO GO AT THE

00:30:17.182 --> 00:30:18.950
END OF NOVEMBER THIS LAST YEAR

00:30:19.017 --> 00:30:20.285
IS TO ESTABLISH THAT DIRECT

00:30:20.351 --> 00:30:23.154
PATIENT CARE AND STAY SILENT

00:30:23.221 --> 00:30:25.490
LIKE WE ALWAYS HAVE. ON HOW THEY

00:30:25.557 --> 00:30:27.325
MEET THE REST OF THE CLINICAL

00:30:27.392 --> 00:30:29.227
OBJECTIVES WITH THE ABILITY THAT

00:30:29.294 --> 00:30:30.228
THEY HAVE THAT IS SCHOOL

00:30:30.295 --> 00:30:32.897
SPECIFIC. AND I KNOW THIS IS NOT

00:30:32.964 --> 00:30:34.299
WHAT YOU GUYS HAVE HEARD FOR THE

00:30:34.365 --> 00:30:35.200
PAST TEN YEARS YOU'VE HEARD THE

00:30:35.266 --> 00:30:37.135
FIGHT 450% FIFTY PERCENT. BUT

00:30:37.202 --> 00:30:39.103
WHEN YOU LOOK AT ANY RESEARCH

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:40.872
DATA RESEARCH DRIVEN DATA. YOU

00:30:40.939 --> 00:30:42.807
HAVE TO HAVE A BASELINE BEFORE

00:30:42.874 --> 00:30:45.476
YOU CAN GO 250% YET THE BASELINE

00:30:45.543 --> 00:30:46.811
. BUT OUR PERCENTAGE THE

00:30:46.878 --> 00:30:48.046
CALIFORNIA BOARD OF REGISTERED

00:30:48.112 --> 00:30:50.315
NURSING IS NEVER ESTABLISH A

00:30:50.381 --> 00:30:57.155
BASELINE. SO WE NEED TO U. S.

00:30:57.222 --> 00:30:59.524
STOCK THAT BASELINE AND THEN OUR

00:30:59.591 --> 00:31:00.925
SCHOOL CAN THEIR- IS RUN. IT

00:31:00.992 --> 00:31:02.427
FIFTY SO PRE LIFE NURSING FROM

00:31:02.493 --> 00:31:03.795
THAT WE A- THROUGHOUT THE STATE

00:31:03.861 --> 00:31:06.097
. AND INDEED APPROVED CURRICULA

00:31:06.164 --> 00:31:07.265
. AND IT'S SPECIFIC TO THE

00:31:07.332 --> 00:31:09.234
DEMOGRAPHIC THAT THE SERVER AND

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:10.969
THE RESOURCES THAT THEY HAVE.

00:31:11.035 --> 00:31:12.537
THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO OFFER THIS

00:31:12.604 --> 00:31:16.140
IS THEIR SCHOOL WELL YOU KNOW.

00:31:16.207 --> 00:31:17.342
WE'LL GET TO THAT I'M SURE

00:31:17.408 --> 00:31:19.210
LATER. LET ME- I'LL LEAVE THE

00:31:19.277 --> 00:31:21.145
FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS ON THE-

00:31:21.212 --> 00:31:23.681
SIMULATION TO MY COLLEAGUE HERE

00:31:23.748 --> 00:31:25.049
ON THE FLOOR WHO IS CERTAINLY

00:31:25.116 --> 00:31:26.184
MORE MORE EXPERIENCED IN THE

00:31:26.251 --> 00:31:29.020
CLINICAL SIDE THAN I AM LET ME

00:31:29.087 --> 00:31:30.188
MOVE QUICKLY TO ONE CLARIFYING.

00:31:30.255 --> 00:31:32.957
QUESTION ON THE SUBJECT OF

00:31:33.024 --> 00:31:34.559
CONCURRENCY THEORY VERSUS

00:31:34.626 --> 00:31:38.863
CLINICAL. AND I UNDERSTAND THE

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:41.833
ADVANTAGES OF HAVING CONCURRENT

00:31:41.899 --> 00:31:44.202
I THINK I DO THEORY AND CLINICAL

00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:46.738
EXPERIENCE THE QUESTION IS

00:31:46.804 --> 00:31:50.375
SHOULD THE SHOULD THE PROGRAM SO

00:31:50.441 --> 00:31:53.611
TO SPEAK ALLOW FOR FLEXIBILITY

00:31:53.678 --> 00:31:55.847
AT THE SCHOOL LEVEL TO DEAL WITH

00:31:55.913 --> 00:31:58.216
INDIVIDUAL. SITUATIONS AND I WAS

00:31:58.283 --> 00:32:00.685
TAKEN IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER-

00:32:00.752 --> 00:32:04.088
WITH THE COMMENT. FROM THE

00:32:04.155 --> 00:32:05.723
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AT THE

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:06.291
CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY

00:32:06.357 --> 00:32:08.626
WHICH IS BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S

00:32:08.693 --> 00:32:10.194
STILL MY UNDERSTANDING LARGEST.

00:32:10.261 --> 00:32:11.129
THAT CASE HIGHER EDUCATIONAL

00:32:11.195 --> 00:32:13.831
SYSTEM IN THE US. AND THE

00:32:13.898 --> 00:32:16.200
COMMENT POINTED OUT. WHAT MY

00:32:16.267 --> 00:32:18.036
COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLYMEMBER IRWIN

00:32:18.102 --> 00:32:19.704
NOTED THAT IN THE CASE OF

00:32:19.771 --> 00:32:21.039
PHYSICIANS AND PHYSICAL

00:32:21.105 --> 00:32:23.708
THERAPISTS AND- PHYSICIANS

00:32:23.775 --> 00:32:25.009
ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS WHICH

00:32:25.076 --> 00:32:26.444
PROGRAM DO NOT NECESSARILY

00:32:26.511 --> 00:32:28.680
REQUIRED EVERY INSTANCE

00:32:28.746 --> 00:32:31.082
CONCURRENCY. AND THE QUOTE IN

00:32:31.149 --> 00:32:33.351
THE BACKGROUND REPORT IS

00:32:33.418 --> 00:32:34.986
FLEXIBILITY IN THE REQUIREMENT

00:32:35.053 --> 00:32:36.988
COULD ALLOW PROGRAMS TO MAXIMIZE

00:32:37.055 --> 00:32:38.523
THE USE OF AVAILABLE PLACEMENTS

00:32:38.589 --> 00:32:41.025
BY FRONT LOADING THEORY CONTENT

00:32:41.092 --> 00:32:42.760
AND IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING WITH

00:32:42.827 --> 00:32:44.529
CORRESPONDING CLINICAL.

00:32:44.595 --> 00:32:47.899
PRACTICUM AND MY QUESTION IS

00:32:47.965 --> 00:32:51.536
SHOULDN'T WE- CONTINUE TO EXPAND

00:32:51.602 --> 00:32:53.438
FLEXIBILITY IN THIS AREA GIVEN

00:32:53.504 --> 00:32:56.174
THE- EVER INCREASING NEED FOR

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.508
HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND THE

00:32:57.575 --> 00:32:59.911
LIKELIHOOD THAT OUR- EXPANSION

00:32:59.977 --> 00:33:01.879
OF CLINICAL FACILITIES AND

00:33:01.946 --> 00:33:03.548
TRAINING SLOTS IS PROBABLY NOT

00:33:03.614 --> 00:33:05.149
GOING TO KEEP UP. WHETHER

00:33:05.216 --> 00:33:06.918
BECAUSE OF ECONOMICS- BECAUSE

00:33:06.984 --> 00:33:09.887
FRANKLY OF. THE CHANGING WAY WE

00:33:09.954 --> 00:33:12.156
DELIVER HEALTHCARE SERVICES IN

00:33:12.223 --> 00:33:19.230
THIS COUNTRY. I'M TRYING TO COME

00:33:19.297 --> 00:33:21.799
OFF MUTE HERE MYSELF THANK YOU-

00:33:21.866 --> 00:33:23.034
SO A COUPLE DIFFERENT THINGS

00:33:23.101 --> 00:33:25.036
THAT WE KIND OF HAVE TO LOOK AT

00:33:25.103 --> 00:33:26.904
IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS WORK ONE

00:33:26.971 --> 00:33:28.539
D. AS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

00:33:28.606 --> 00:33:29.874
PHYSICIAN'S ASSISTANTS YOU LOOK

00:33:29.941 --> 00:33:31.275
AT THE MEDICAL PROGRAMS THEY

00:33:31.342 --> 00:33:33.211
HAVE A ONE YEAR INTERNSHIP AND

00:33:33.277 --> 00:33:35.847
EXPRESSED. EXTERNSHIP INTERNSHIP

00:33:35.913 --> 00:33:38.716
SORRY AND A RESIDENCY AFTER

00:33:38.783 --> 00:33:40.318
THEIR COMPLETE THEIR PROGRAM

00:33:40.385 --> 00:33:42.687
WHERE THEY ARE AT THE FACILITY

00:33:42.754 --> 00:33:46.023
THAT THEY'RE DOING TRAINING. AND

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:47.592
THERE WE HAVE A MENTOR THERE ARE

00:33:47.658 --> 00:33:49.360
SIGNS YOU AT PHYSICIAN NETWORKS

00:33:49.427 --> 00:33:52.463
WITH THEM THE ENTIRE TIME AS- A

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:54.031
ONE YEAR FIRST YEAR RESIDENCY IS

00:33:54.098 --> 00:33:56.300
SECOND YEAR RESIDENCY THEY DO

00:33:56.367 --> 00:33:58.569
THIS AS AFTER THEY'VE COMPLETED

00:33:58.636 --> 00:34:00.805
THE CORE PART OF THEIR

00:34:00.872 --> 00:34:02.607
CURRICULUM. AND THAT'S NOT THE

00:34:02.673 --> 00:34:04.075
WAY THAT NURSING EDUCATION IS

00:34:04.142 --> 00:34:06.043
SET UP WE DON'T HAVE THAT WHEN

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:09.614
NURSES GRADUATE THEY GO INTO A

00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:10.782
TRANSITION PROGRAM LIKE I SAID

00:34:10.848 --> 00:34:12.550
WAS ABOUT SIX WEEKS WHEN YOU

00:34:12.617 --> 00:34:14.018
LOOK AT THE IMPACT THAT'S ON OUR

00:34:14.085 --> 00:34:16.087
HEALTHCARE FACILITIES RIGHT NOW.

00:34:16.154 --> 00:34:18.823
THEY WHEN COLEMAN HIT AND THEY

00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:20.024
LOST THEIR EDUCATORS THE BOULDER

00:34:20.091 --> 00:34:22.160
EDUCATORS IN THE STAFF THOSE

00:34:22.226 --> 00:34:23.394
EDUCATORS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE

00:34:23.461 --> 00:34:25.663
RESPONSIBLE FOR- NEW GRADUATE

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:27.532
PROGRAMS. THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT

00:34:27.598 --> 00:34:29.700
THERE TO SERVE THEM ANYMORE IT'S

00:34:29.767 --> 00:34:31.536
SO YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT

00:34:31.602 --> 00:34:32.904
THERE IS AN INNATE DIFFERENCES

00:34:32.970 --> 00:34:35.106
BETWEEN THE MEDICAL EDUCATION

00:34:35.173 --> 00:34:37.275
AND THE NURSING EDUCATION BUT

00:34:37.341 --> 00:34:39.076
THEY'RE NOT SET UP TO BE

00:34:39.143 --> 00:34:42.447
SIMILAR. NOW WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT

00:34:42.513 --> 00:34:43.080
THE FLEXIBILITY TO THE NURSING

00:34:43.147 --> 00:34:46.951
PROGRAMS IF WE DROP BACK TO A

00:34:47.018 --> 00:34:48.486
DIRECT PATIENT CARE MINIMUM

00:34:48.553 --> 00:34:50.922
REQUIREMENT WHAT HAPPENS IS IT

00:34:50.988 --> 00:34:53.524
MAKES IT LESS HOURS THAT HAVE TO

00:34:53.591 --> 00:34:55.259
BE COMPLETE COMPLETED ON A

00:34:55.326 --> 00:34:57.662
SEMESTER BASIS. SO BAD EVEN

00:34:57.728 --> 00:35:00.131
AFFECTS THAT SCHEDULING FIASCO

00:35:00.198 --> 00:35:01.833
BECAUSE THEY WON'T HAVE AN

00:35:01.899 --> 00:35:04.735
EXCESSIVE NUMBER OF HOURS TO DO

00:35:04.802 --> 00:35:07.205
ON A SEMESTER SEMESTER BASIS

00:35:07.271 --> 00:35:09.774
WHICH THEN DOESN'T REQUIRED TO

00:35:09.841 --> 00:35:11.409
HAVE THAT ABILITY TO PULL THEM

00:35:11.476 --> 00:35:18.950
INTO NEXT SEMESTER BECAUSE. IN

00:35:19.016 --> 00:35:20.051
FACT WE DECREASED THAT. WOULD

00:35:20.117 --> 00:35:22.820
THEN ACTS IF. AT ADDRESS. THE

00:35:22.887 --> 00:35:23.988
CLINICAL IMPACT ATTACKING THAT

00:35:24.055 --> 00:35:26.991
AREA SO IF WE- THREE. OF A

00:35:27.058 --> 00:35:30.728
CLINICAL. THAT'S A HUNDRED AND

00:35:30.795 --> 00:35:32.730
FORTY FOUR HOURS BAG IS A

00:35:32.797 --> 00:35:36.467
REQUIREMENT FOR A SIXTEEN WEEK

00:35:36.534 --> 00:35:38.269
SEMESTER. IN ORDER FOR THAT

00:35:38.336 --> 00:35:40.938
STUDENT TO DO IT AND THAT'S WHAT

00:35:41.005 --> 00:35:42.306
THEIR CURRENT REGULATIONS RIGHT

00:35:42.373 --> 00:35:44.775
BUT SEE WE HAVE A SCHOOL THAT

00:35:44.842 --> 00:35:46.711
SAYS YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN THREE

00:35:46.777 --> 00:35:48.446
THREE UNITS IS GOOD BUT I THINK

00:35:48.513 --> 00:35:50.748
I SHOULD DO FOUR AND A HALF

00:35:50.815 --> 00:35:52.083
UNITS. WELL WHEN THEY DECIDE

00:35:52.149 --> 00:35:54.252
THAT APPARENTLY AND DO THAT ON

00:35:54.318 --> 00:35:57.421
THEIR OWN THEY NOW ARE REQUIRING

00:35:57.488 --> 00:35:59.991
THEIR STUDENTS WITH OUR B. R.

00:36:00.057 --> 00:36:02.393
AND DIRECTION THE COMPLETE TWO

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:04.896
HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN HOURS IN A

00:36:04.962 --> 00:36:07.498
CLINICAL SETTING WHICH AND

00:36:07.565 --> 00:36:09.066
THAT'S SEVENTY TWO MORE HOURS IN

00:36:09.133 --> 00:36:11.602
THE BORDERS REQUIRING. SO IF WE

00:36:11.669 --> 00:36:14.272
SET A MINIMUM DIRECT PATIENT

00:36:14.338 --> 00:36:15.640
CARE THEY DON'T HAVE THOSE

00:36:15.706 --> 00:36:16.974
MINIMUM DIRECT PATIENT CARE

00:36:17.041 --> 00:36:18.943
HOURS TO HAVE TO HAVE THAT

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:20.811
CONCURRENCY FLEXIBILITY TO GO

00:36:20.878 --> 00:36:22.847
INTO THE NEXT SEMESTER ND

00:36:22.914 --> 00:36:24.215
THEY'RE NOT INTO IT IT'S BEEN

00:36:24.282 --> 00:36:26.217
STACKING THE DECK AGAINST THEM

00:36:26.284 --> 00:36:28.753
BECAUSE IF YOU CARRY OVER

00:36:28.819 --> 00:36:30.054
SEVENTY TWO HOURS FROM THE NEXT

00:36:30.121 --> 00:36:31.789
FROM THE PREVIOUS SEMESTER OF

00:36:31.856 --> 00:36:34.058
DIRECT PATIENT CARE HOURS. THAT

00:36:34.125 --> 00:36:35.192
NEEDED TO BE COMPLETED IN THE

00:36:35.259 --> 00:36:37.161
NEXT SEMESTER ANYWAY ADD THAT ON

00:36:37.228 --> 00:36:41.265
TOP OF THEIR. HUNDRED AND FORTY

00:36:41.332 --> 00:36:42.199
FOUR HOURS. WELL NOW YOU HAVE TO

00:36:42.266 --> 00:36:43.267
ENTER SIXTEEN HAVE BEEN AND

00:36:43.334 --> 00:36:45.202
THAT'S- WHAT. YOU'RE NOT EVEN

00:36:45.269 --> 00:36:47.004
GONNA BE ABLE TO DO THAT SO THE

00:36:47.071 --> 00:36:48.639
NEXT SEMESTER GONNA DUMP IN

00:36:48.706 --> 00:36:49.540
PROBABLY EIGHTY SIX MORE HOURS

00:36:49.607 --> 00:36:51.342
INTO THAT SEMESTER AND COMPILE

00:36:51.409 --> 00:36:53.110
THAT ON TO THE NEXT ONE. SO I

00:36:53.177 --> 00:36:55.746
UNDERSTAND THEIR NEED I TRULY DO

00:36:55.813 --> 00:36:57.815
I WAS A PROGRAM DIRECTOR FOR

00:36:57.882 --> 00:36:58.950
YEARS I HAD A DIFFICULT TIME

00:36:59.016 --> 00:37:00.518
SCHEDULING MY STUDENTS I WAS

00:37:00.585 --> 00:37:01.719
EVEN THE CLINICAL PLACEMENT

00:37:01.786 --> 00:37:03.087
COORDINATOR CAUGHT MY SCHOOL

00:37:03.154 --> 00:37:04.889
BEFORE IT BECAME THE PROGRAM

00:37:04.956 --> 00:37:06.457
DIRECTOR. CLINICALS ARE HARD AND

00:37:06.524 --> 00:37:08.793
THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO LOOK AT

00:37:08.859 --> 00:37:10.094
SOLVING THIS A DIFFERENT ROUTE

00:37:10.161 --> 00:37:12.997
AND THAT IS WHERE WE STAB US IN

00:37:13.064 --> 00:37:13.798
MINIMUM. DIRECT PATIENT CARE

00:37:13.864 --> 00:37:15.299
REQUIREMENTS WE ALREADY HAVE

00:37:15.366 --> 00:37:16.767
THAT IN OUR REGULATIONS RIGHT

00:37:16.834 --> 00:37:19.737
NOW IN SIXTEEN C. C. R. FOURTEEN

00:37:19.804 --> 00:37:20.938
EIGHTY FOUR FOR NURSE

00:37:21.005 --> 00:37:21.606
PRACTITIONERS. THAT IS IN

00:37:21.672 --> 00:37:23.574
ALIGNMENT WITH THE NATIONAL

00:37:23.641 --> 00:37:24.008
STANDARDS FOR NURSE

00:37:24.075 --> 00:37:25.109
PRACTITIONERS THAT SAY YOU HAVE

00:37:25.176 --> 00:37:26.677
TO COMPLETE. FIVE HUNDRED HOURS

00:37:26.744 --> 00:37:28.713
OF SUPERVISED DIRECT PATIENT

00:37:28.779 --> 00:37:30.548
CARE AND THEN OUR NURSE

00:37:30.615 --> 00:37:31.849
PRACTITIONER PROGRAMS ARE ABLE

00:37:31.916 --> 00:37:33.884
TO DO STANDARDIZED PATIENTS OR

00:37:33.951 --> 00:37:36.787
ABOVE. WHAT AND SIMULATIONS OVER

00:37:36.854 --> 00:37:37.955
TO BOB WHAT OUR MINIMUM

00:37:38.022 --> 00:37:40.024
REQUIREMENT IS TO PREPARE THEIR

00:37:40.091 --> 00:37:42.426
STUDENTS THIS PUTS US INTO A

00:37:42.493 --> 00:37:43.861
LINE MET WITH THOSE NATIONAL

00:37:43.928 --> 00:37:45.296
STANDARDS BEING ABLE TO DO THAT

00:37:45.363 --> 00:37:47.365
SIMILARLY TO WHAT WE ALREADY DO

00:37:47.431 --> 00:37:50.034
FOR AND KEEP PROGRAMS. SO IT

00:37:50.101 --> 00:37:52.770
TRULY ADDRESSES ALL OF THOSE

00:37:52.837 --> 00:37:54.005
AREAS THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT UP

00:37:54.071 --> 00:37:55.906
AS A CONCERN BECAUSE THOSE ARE

00:37:55.973 --> 00:37:57.942
CONCERNS AS WELL. WELL LISTEN

00:37:58.009 --> 00:37:59.143
THE CHANGES THAT THE BOARD IS

00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:01.879
PUT IN PLACE MAY VERY WELL DEAL

00:38:01.946 --> 00:38:03.180
WITH THIS I GUESS MY QUESTION

00:38:03.247 --> 00:38:04.148
IS. YOU KNOW MY CONCERN IS THE

00:38:04.215 --> 00:38:06.717
STUDENTS THAT HAVE TO DROP OUT

00:38:06.784 --> 00:38:07.652
OF NURSING PROGRAMS BECAUSE OF

00:38:07.718 --> 00:38:09.320
THE CONCURRENCY REQUIREMENT. FOR

00:38:09.387 --> 00:38:11.222
ONE REASON OR ANOTHER SO. THE

00:38:11.288 --> 00:38:12.757
QUESTION IS DOES THE BOARD

00:38:12.823 --> 00:38:14.425
MONITOR THE NUMBER OF DRUG

00:38:14.492 --> 00:38:16.494
PROGRAM DROPOUTS ASSOCIATED WITH

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:21.632
THE CONCURRENCY. REQUIREMENTS

00:38:21.699 --> 00:38:23.534
WHICH I HOPE THE ANSWER IS YES.

00:38:23.601 --> 00:38:25.069
AND IF IT NOT I HOPE YOU WILL BE

00:38:25.136 --> 00:38:26.437
BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO SEE HELLO

00:38:26.504 --> 00:38:28.906
AND SEE THE EFFECT OF THE

00:38:28.973 --> 00:38:30.408
CHANGES THAT YOU PUT IN PLACE.

00:38:30.474 --> 00:38:31.542
ON THE ISSUES THAT THE SCHOOLS

00:38:31.609 --> 00:38:32.877
SEEM TO BE COMPLAINING ABOUT

00:38:32.943 --> 00:38:33.811
THOSE THAT COMPLAIN ABOUT THE

00:38:33.878 --> 00:38:34.345
CONCURRENCY REQUIREMENTS.

00:38:34.412 --> 00:38:34.979
APPARENTLY INCLUDING. THE

00:38:35.046 --> 00:38:36.313
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE OF THE

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:38.349
CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SO.

00:38:38.416 --> 00:38:40.151
SOMEBODY SEES A PROBLEM I'M

00:38:40.217 --> 00:38:41.819
HOPING THAT YOUR CHANGES HAVE

00:38:41.886 --> 00:38:43.821
ADDRESSED IT BUT IF NOT I'D LIKE

00:38:43.888 --> 00:38:45.756
SOME STATISTICS SO WE KNOW. THE

00:38:45.823 --> 00:38:47.925
SCOPE OF THE REMAINING PRO PRO-

00:38:47.992 --> 00:38:49.760
PROBLEM. THE NEXT TIME WE GATHER

00:38:49.827 --> 00:38:51.529
AT THE RIVER TO HAVE THIS

00:38:51.595 --> 00:38:53.097
CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT. DELAY

00:38:53.164 --> 00:38:54.965
LOVE THAT IDEA DO YOU KEEP

00:38:55.032 --> 00:38:56.901
STATISTICS ON THE NUMBER OF

00:38:56.967 --> 00:38:58.736
PROGRAMMATIC DROPOUTS THAT OCCUR

00:38:58.803 --> 00:39:00.104
BECAUSE OF THE- CONCERT

00:39:00.171 --> 00:39:03.040
CONCURRENCY REQUIREMENTS AT THE

00:39:03.107 --> 00:39:04.775
SCHOOL LEVEL. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY

00:39:04.842 --> 00:39:06.777
REGULATORY AUTHORITY OVER

00:39:06.844 --> 00:39:10.047
ATTRITION. RATES AT ALL- WITH

00:39:10.114 --> 00:39:11.148
THE NATIONAL COUNCIL STATE

00:39:11.215 --> 00:39:13.084
BOARDS OF NURSING AID ASK US TO

00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:15.219
MONITOR ATTRITION WE DO AND IT

00:39:15.286 --> 00:39:17.254
IS SHARED ON OUR BOARD'S WEBSITE

00:39:17.321 --> 00:39:18.923
WHAT THAT IS. THE DIFFERENCE

00:39:18.989 --> 00:39:20.291
THAT WE DO THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN

00:39:20.357 --> 00:39:21.926
TITLE FOR FUNDING WHICH IS THE

00:39:21.992 --> 00:39:23.027
NATIONAL LEVELS THEY DO TIME AND

00:39:23.094 --> 00:39:25.029
A HALF FOR COMPLETION SO GIVE IT

00:39:25.096 --> 00:39:26.697
TO YOUR PROGRAM. THEIR TUITION

00:39:26.764 --> 00:39:28.899
NUMBERS FOR FUNDING IS BASED ON

00:39:28.966 --> 00:39:30.801
A TIME AND A HALF SO THEY ALLOW

00:39:30.868 --> 00:39:32.136
FOR THREE YEARS TO COMPLETE IT.

00:39:32.203 --> 00:39:33.637
THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING

00:39:33.704 --> 00:39:35.306
GOES ABOVE THAT AND WHAT WE DO

00:39:35.372 --> 00:39:37.341
IS WE TRACK ON TIME COMPLETION

00:39:37.408 --> 00:39:38.242
SO IF YOU HAVE A TWO YEAR

00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:40.377
PROGRAM. WE WANT TO NOTE THAT

00:39:40.444 --> 00:39:42.947
STUDENT ABYAN SEE SIGNED UP HERE

00:39:43.013 --> 00:39:45.616
THEY COMPLETED TWO YEARS LATER

00:39:45.683 --> 00:39:47.218
100% ON TIME WHICH IS WHAT THAT

00:39:47.284 --> 00:39:51.522
ATTRITION NUMBER YES. WE

00:39:51.589 --> 00:39:52.123
COLLECTED THAT DATA. IT IS ON

00:39:52.189 --> 00:39:55.392
OUR- IN ORDER TO GET DATA THAT

00:39:55.459 --> 00:39:56.327
SAYS WHY. DOES SCHOOLS WOULD

00:39:56.393 --> 00:39:58.996
HAVE TO DO AN EXIT INTERVIEW

00:39:59.063 --> 00:40:00.731
WITH EACH ONE OF THOSE STUDENTS.

00:40:00.798 --> 00:40:03.134
TO FIND OUT WHY THE TRULY

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:04.702
DROPPED OUT WHEN. I CAN'T

00:40:04.769 --> 00:40:06.303
POSSIBLY BE THE CASE BECAUSE YOU

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:07.938
HAVE. CLINICAL PLACEMENT

00:40:08.005 --> 00:40:10.107
MONITORS IN NURSING SCHOOLS AND

00:40:10.174 --> 00:40:11.242
BECAUSE OF THE CONCURRENCY

00:40:11.308 --> 00:40:13.177
REQUIREMENTS. THOSE PLACEMENT

00:40:13.244 --> 00:40:14.211
DIRECTORS WOULD KNOW WHETHER OR

00:40:14.278 --> 00:40:15.012
NOT

00:40:15.079 --> 00:40:16.914
AVAILABLE. AND WHETHER THE

00:40:16.981 --> 00:40:18.883
STUDENT CAN. PARTICIPATE IN A

00:40:18.949 --> 00:40:20.618
CLINICAL SLOT. CONCURRENT WITH

00:40:20.684 --> 00:40:22.219
THE PARTICULAR PROGRAM AND IF

00:40:22.286 --> 00:40:23.854
THE STUDENT CAN'T THEN THE

00:40:23.921 --> 00:40:25.022
STUDENT. CAN'T COMPLETE THAT

00:40:25.089 --> 00:40:28.759
COURSE SO THERE MUST BE DATA.

00:40:28.826 --> 00:40:32.029
SOMEWHERE HE ASKED. CAN AND I

00:40:32.096 --> 00:40:34.899
HEAR YOU ON THAT I YOU ON AND I

00:40:34.965 --> 00:40:36.667
WOULD LOVE TO SAY ABSOLUTELY YES

00:40:36.734 --> 00:40:38.936
. IF IT IS A SCHEDULING ISSUE IF

00:40:39.003 --> 00:40:41.071
IT IS TRULY JUST BECAUSE THEY

00:40:41.138 --> 00:40:44.108
WEREN'T ABLE TO PROGRESS. BAD

00:40:44.175 --> 00:40:46.177
DATA WAS ONLY AVAILABLE DURING

00:40:46.243 --> 00:40:48.412
KOBE. WE'RE NOW NOT IN THE MIDST

00:40:48.479 --> 00:40:50.047
OF KOBE HAT DATA WAS NOT

00:40:50.114 --> 00:40:51.682
COLLECTED BEFORE BY THE PROGRAMS

00:40:51.749 --> 00:40:53.684
IT WAS NOT REPORTED. WE DO HAVE

00:40:53.751 --> 00:40:57.721
SOME DATA WITHIN OUR OUR- UCSF

00:40:57.788 --> 00:41:00.791
CONTRACT REPORT AND IF THEY DO

00:41:00.858 --> 00:41:02.993
SAY THAT THEY ARE DIFFICULT TIME

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:04.728
GETTING CLINICAL SPACES. THEY

00:41:04.795 --> 00:41:06.263
ALSO HAVE THE SAME DATA THAT

00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:08.833
SAYS EVEN WITH THE 25% THAT THEY

00:41:08.899 --> 00:41:10.668
CAN USE IN SIMULATION. THEY'RE

00:41:10.734 --> 00:41:13.537
NOT USING IT THEY'RE USING 15%

00:41:13.604 --> 00:41:16.707
ARE USING 18% SO IT'S A MUCH

00:41:16.774 --> 00:41:18.108
MORE COMPLEX ISSUE THAN JUST A

00:41:18.175 --> 00:41:20.644
CUT AND DRY ANSWER. SO IF A

00:41:20.711 --> 00:41:23.214
STUDENT IS NOT ABLE TO PROGRESS

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:25.616
SPECIFICALLY JUST FOR CLINICAL

00:41:25.683 --> 00:41:28.752
REASONS THEN THAT IS DATA THAT

00:41:28.819 --> 00:41:30.287
THE SCHOOL HOUSE TO TELLER AND

00:41:30.354 --> 00:41:32.756
HE SEES. AND WHEN THEY COME INTO

00:41:32.823 --> 00:41:34.625
ANY ISSUE LIKE THAT PRIOR TO

00:41:34.692 --> 00:41:36.994
KOBE THEY REACHED OUT TO THE

00:41:37.061 --> 00:41:38.395
NEC'S THE NEC'S MADE A PLAN WITH

00:41:38.462 --> 00:41:40.865
THEM AND THEY GOT THEM TO

00:41:40.931 --> 00:41:43.033
CONTINUE. WHAT TYPICALLY WE SEE

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:45.135
IS THAT IT'S A PERSONAL ISSUE

00:41:45.202 --> 00:41:49.406
IT'S- MONETARY HARDSHIP- IT'S-

00:41:49.473 --> 00:41:51.242
PREGNANCY YOU'RE A MEDICAL LEAVE

00:41:51.308 --> 00:41:53.944
OF ABSENCE- THERE SOME OTHER

00:41:54.011 --> 00:41:56.513
REASON THAT REQUIRES STUDENTS

00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:58.682
NOT TO CONTINUE. AND IT'S NOT

00:41:58.749 --> 00:42:00.217
NECESSARILY THAT THEY COULDN'T

00:42:00.284 --> 00:42:02.887
GET SCHEDULE OUR DIRECTORS ARE

00:42:02.953 --> 00:42:05.556
AMAZINGLY AND THAT. AND THEY

00:42:05.623 --> 00:42:08.092
WILL FIND PLACEMENTS THEY CALL

00:42:08.158 --> 00:42:09.960
UP THEIR FRIENDS THEY CALL US WE

00:42:10.027 --> 00:42:11.662
START LOOKING FOR THEM REACHING

00:42:11.729 --> 00:42:13.597
OUT TO AREA HOSPITALS AREA

00:42:13.664 --> 00:42:15.165
CLINICS AND SAYING HEY. CAN YOU

00:42:15.232 --> 00:42:16.867
GET THE STUDENT AND THEY HAVE

00:42:16.934 --> 00:42:19.203
TWELVE HOURS LEFT TO DO. BUT

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:21.772
THAT AGAIN IS IMPORTANT TO US

00:42:21.839 --> 00:42:22.973
AND THAT'S WHY WE STARTED

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:24.341
LOOKING AT THESE AND I BROUGHT

00:42:24.408 --> 00:42:26.510
IT FORWARD TO OUR BOARD IN

00:42:26.577 --> 00:42:27.745
NOVEMBER. WAS DAMAGED IN MINIMUM

00:42:27.811 --> 00:42:29.246
PRACTICE YOU CARE BECAUSE IT

00:42:29.313 --> 00:42:31.649
DECREASES THE AMOUNT OF TIME

00:42:31.715 --> 00:42:34.985
THAT THAT STUDENT HAS TO BE IN A

00:42:35.052 --> 00:42:39.924
CLINICAL OVER AND ABOVE. WHAT WE

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:41.258
REQUIRE WHEN WE HAVE A OVER IN

00:42:41.325 --> 00:42:43.193
THAT SAYS. I WANT TO GO ABOVE TO

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:45.396
BE IS FOR. A REQUIRED FOUR. IN

00:42:45.462 --> 00:42:46.697
A- CLINICAL SETTING AND WE WERE

00:42:46.764 --> 00:42:49.099
ONLY REQUIRED EIGHTEEN WHEN YOU

00:42:49.166 --> 00:42:51.335
HAVE EIGHTEEN UNITS WHICH IS OUR

00:42:51.402 --> 00:42:53.637
MINIMUM STANDARD TODAY AT EIGHT

00:42:53.704 --> 00:42:54.772
HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR HOURS.

00:42:54.838 --> 00:42:56.941
WHEN THE SCHOOL SAYS I THINK

00:42:57.007 --> 00:42:57.808
TWENTY FOUR UNITS IS BETTER

00:42:57.875 --> 00:43:00.778
THAT'S ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED

00:43:00.844 --> 00:43:01.979
FIFTY TWO HOURS SO IF WE DO A

00:43:02.046 --> 00:43:03.247
MINIMUM DIRECT PATIENT CARE THEY

00:43:03.314 --> 00:43:05.683
CAN KEEP THE ONE THOUSAND ONE

00:43:05.749 --> 00:43:07.251
HUNDRED FIFTY TWO HOURS THAT

00:43:07.318 --> 00:43:08.886
THEY THINK IS BETTER. BUT THAT

00:43:08.953 --> 00:43:10.387
MEANS ONLY FIVE HUNDRED AND THAT

00:43:10.454 --> 00:43:11.956
IF THEY HAVE TWENTY FOUR UNITS

00:43:12.022 --> 00:43:13.190
IS IN DIRECT PATIENT CARE OR

00:43:13.257 --> 00:43:14.124
FIVE HUNDRED THAT'D BE IT

00:43:14.191 --> 00:43:15.693
EIGHTEEN UNITS IS IN DIRECT

00:43:15.759 --> 00:43:17.594
PATIENT CARE. AND THAT ALLOWS

00:43:17.661 --> 00:43:18.862
FOR ALL OF THOSE ADDITIONAL

00:43:18.929 --> 00:43:20.764
UNITS THE INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL SAYS

00:43:20.831 --> 00:43:22.833
I THINK IS BETTER. CAN BE DONE

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:26.036
IN A CERTAIN WAY. AND BACKED.

00:43:26.103 --> 00:43:27.805
YOU RAISE. ALMOST A HUNDRED

00:43:27.871 --> 00:43:29.807
PERCENT. AND CONCURRENCY ISSUE

00:43:29.873 --> 00:43:31.942
THAT CLINICAL IMPACTION ISSUE.

00:43:32.009 --> 00:43:35.245
AND TRULY. PUTS LESS OF A BURDEN

00:43:35.312 --> 00:43:36.714
ON THE COMMUNITY IN THE AREA

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:39.216
SCHOOLS AROUND THE WORLD SO IT'S

00:43:39.283 --> 00:43:40.651
QUITE POSSIBLE THAT THE CHANGES

00:43:40.718 --> 00:43:42.786
YOU PUT IN PLACE OF. ELIMINATED

00:43:42.853 --> 00:43:44.755
THE ISSUE OR PERHAPS I JUST

00:43:44.822 --> 00:43:45.990
MISUNDERSTOOD WHAT PEOPLE WERE

00:45:05.702 --> 00:45:07.171
NOT HAVE CLINICAL SLOTS THAT YOU

00:45:07.237 --> 00:45:09.106
DON'T GO HUNTING AROUND FOR THEM

00:45:09.173 --> 00:45:11.842
AFTER THEY SIGN UP YOU HAVE TO

00:45:11.909 --> 00:45:12.476
ALREADY HAVE THE GRIEVANCE IN

00:45:12.543 --> 00:45:13.944
PLACE THE EMMA USE AND SO FORTH.

00:45:14.011 --> 00:45:15.879
IS THAT DIFFERENT NURSING I MEAN

00:45:15.946 --> 00:45:17.848
SO WE CAN START A NURSING SCHOOL

00:45:17.915 --> 00:45:20.717
AND THEN DIED NOT PEOPLE BUT I

00:45:20.784 --> 00:45:23.020
GUESS- NOT BE ASSURED THEY HAVE

00:45:23.087 --> 00:45:24.188
THE CLINICAL SLOTS THEY NEED TO

00:45:24.254 --> 00:45:25.355
BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THEIR

00:45:25.422 --> 00:45:28.358
EDUCATION THE SCHOOL HAS A RATE

00:45:28.425 --> 00:45:30.394
RANGE FOR THAT IN ADVANCE. SO

00:45:30.461 --> 00:45:31.662
ALL OF US AN EXAMPLE WHAT

00:45:31.728 --> 00:45:33.730
HAPPENED WITH KOBE. WE HAVE AS

00:45:33.797 --> 00:45:34.631
THE BEER AND WE HAVEN'T ALREADY

00:45:34.698 --> 00:45:36.767
OVER ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS WE

00:45:36.834 --> 00:45:38.735
DON'T HAVE ANY OF YOUR- OVER OUR

00:45:38.802 --> 00:45:41.138
HEALTH. FACILITIES SO THEY WILL

00:45:41.205 --> 00:45:43.107
HAVE CONTRACTS IN PLACE MOST OF

00:45:43.173 --> 00:45:44.608
OUR SCHOOLS HAVE SEVERAL

00:45:44.675 --> 00:45:46.043
CONTRACTS IN PLACE. FOR MALL

00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:47.945
RIGHT. AND THEN SOMETHING

00:45:48.011 --> 00:45:49.913
HAPPENS AND THEY'RE REMOVED FROM

00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:51.915
THAT CLINICAL SITE JUST LIKE

00:45:51.982 --> 00:45:53.150
THEY HAPPEN WITH COLEMAN OKAY

00:45:53.217 --> 00:45:54.685
SOMETHING HAPPENED. THEY WERE

00:45:54.751 --> 00:45:56.820
REMOVED FROM THAT SITE. AND SO

00:45:56.887 --> 00:45:58.388
IF THE JOINT COMMISSION COMES

00:45:58.455 --> 00:45:59.590
THROUGH THEY'LL CALL UP THE

00:45:59.656 --> 00:46:01.191
SCHOOL EIGHT I CAN'T HAVE

00:46:01.258 --> 00:46:02.826
STUDENTS THIS WEEK. AND OR

00:46:02.893 --> 00:46:05.896
THEY'LL SAY- WERE REMODELING.

00:46:05.963 --> 00:46:07.664
THAT MAKE LABOR AND DELIVERY

00:46:07.731 --> 00:46:09.166
UNIT WE CAN'T HAVE STUDENTS IN

00:46:09.233 --> 00:46:10.400
PLACE WILL HAVE AN EIGHT MONTH

00:46:10.467 --> 00:46:12.035
PROJECT. AND WE'LL HAVE YOU GUYS

00:46:12.102 --> 00:46:13.403
BACK NEXT YEAR AFTER EIGHT

00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:15.672
MONTHS AND SO THERE WILL BE A

00:46:15.739 --> 00:46:17.040
SEMESTER. THAT THERE THAT

00:46:17.107 --> 00:46:18.809
CLINICAL FACILITY THAT THEY USED

00:46:18.876 --> 00:46:20.844
TO USE IS NOW NOT THERE OKAY BUT

00:46:20.911 --> 00:46:22.546
STILL. WE DO- ADEQUATELY

00:46:22.613 --> 00:46:23.914
CLINICAL RESEARCH CLINICAL

00:46:23.981 --> 00:46:25.883
ADEQUATE CLINICAL FACILITIES.

00:46:25.949 --> 00:46:27.718
FOR EACH OF OUR PROGRAMS. BUT WE

00:46:27.784 --> 00:46:29.186
CAN'T GUARANTEE THEY'RE GOING TO

00:46:29.253 --> 00:46:33.390
BE THERE OKAY. TIRED TIME. EIGHT

00:46:33.457 --> 00:46:35.125
SECONDS OKAY WELL I DON'T IT IN

00:46:35.192 --> 00:46:36.326
THE LOCKER AND ASK ABOUT THIS

00:46:36.393 --> 00:46:38.095
BUT- IT I THINK IT'S HELPFUL TO

00:46:38.162 --> 00:46:40.664
KNOW. NO WE YOU KNOW WE DON'T

00:46:40.731 --> 00:46:41.665
SEE ANY IT'S ALSO IT'S LIKE.

00:46:41.732 --> 00:46:44.334
OBVIOUSLY OBVIOUSLY- WELL WE

00:46:44.401 --> 00:46:46.470
EXPECT THE WELL THOSE OF US IN

00:46:46.537 --> 00:46:47.938
INTO MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH

00:46:48.005 --> 00:46:49.206
KNEW THAT PANDEMICS COMING WE

00:46:49.273 --> 00:46:50.707
CAN SAY EXACTLY WHEN SO

00:46:50.774 --> 00:46:52.075
OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW AND COVERED

00:46:52.142 --> 00:46:53.177
HEAD IT WAS QUOTE UNQUOTE

00:46:53.243 --> 00:46:55.112
UNEXPECTED IN A WAY OF LIKE WE'D

00:46:55.179 --> 00:46:57.080
INSTANTLY SCHEDULE THAT- I

00:46:57.147 --> 00:46:59.683
THINK. SOMEONE REMODELING THEIR

00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:00.884
L. AND D. DELIVERY THEY SHOULD

00:47:00.951 --> 00:47:02.853
KNOW IN ADVANCE AND SO THAT

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:04.121
SHOULD HOPEFULLY BE BUILT INTO A

00:47:04.188 --> 00:47:05.656
CONTRACT THAT THEY'RE CERTAIN

00:47:05.722 --> 00:47:08.492
NOTIFICATIONS SO FORTH SO THAT

00:47:08.559 --> 00:47:09.660
SCHOOL CAN PLAN. AND FOR SCHOOL

00:47:09.726 --> 00:47:11.695
AND AGAIN IN IN IN MEDICINE TOO

00:47:11.762 --> 00:47:12.496
RIGHT WE HAVE MEDICAL SCHOOLS

00:47:12.563 --> 00:47:14.431
AND RESIDENCY PROGRAMS THERE'S A

00:47:14.498 --> 00:47:15.799
RESPONSIBLE INSTITUTION AND THEY

00:47:15.866 --> 00:47:17.534
HAVE CONTRACTS AND THE USE WITH

00:47:17.601 --> 00:47:19.069
OTHER ONES. RIGHT THAT SURE THAT

00:47:19.136 --> 00:47:20.671
THEY HAVE THIS CLINICAL

00:47:20.737 --> 00:47:21.838
POSITIONS AVAILABLE SO THAT YOU

00:47:21.905 --> 00:47:23.540
DON'T HAVE TRAINEES GOING AROUND

00:47:23.607 --> 00:47:25.108
TRYING TO HUNT AROUND FOR THAT.

00:47:25.175 --> 00:47:27.611
REALIZING THAT BECAUSE OF IT YOU

00:47:27.678 --> 00:47:28.912
DON'T CHANGE A LOT OF THINGS- I

00:47:28.979 --> 00:47:32.049
ATE SO. BACK I DO THINK THAT-

00:47:32.115 --> 00:47:33.383
AND I REALIZE THAT MAYBE YOU

00:47:33.450 --> 00:47:35.118
CAN'T TRACK DIRECTLY BUT YOU DO

00:47:35.185 --> 00:47:36.386
HAVE REGULATORY AUTHORITY ARE

00:47:36.453 --> 00:47:37.354
YOU HAVE SOME OVERSIGHT

00:47:37.421 --> 00:47:38.889
AUTHORITY OVER THE INSTITUTIONS

00:47:38.956 --> 00:47:41.692
I THINK IS- THE CHAIR HAD SAID-

00:47:41.758 --> 00:47:43.493
MAYBE THOSE INSTITUTIONS SHOULD

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:45.862
BE ABLE TO PROVIDING- SOME.

00:47:45.929 --> 00:47:48.065
INFORMATION ABOUT THE PIPELINE

00:47:48.131 --> 00:47:49.233
THROUGH THE SCHOOLS HOW YOU

00:47:49.299 --> 00:47:51.168
START HOW MAY COMING OUT AND THE

00:47:51.235 --> 00:47:52.269
REASONS PEOPLE DROP OUT IN THE

00:47:52.336 --> 00:47:55.205
PROCESS. RIGHT SO IS IT BECAUSE-

00:47:55.272 --> 00:47:56.340
THEY COULDN'T FIND A CLINICAL

00:47:56.406 --> 00:47:58.542
SLOT VERSES THEY HAD MANY OF THE

00:47:58.609 --> 00:47:59.676
OTHER ISSUES YOU HAVE OUTLINED

00:47:59.743 --> 00:48:01.678
SO HOPEFULLY THAT IS DATA THE

00:48:01.745 --> 00:48:02.679
BOARD CAN GET THROUGH THE

00:48:02.746 --> 00:48:04.648
INSTITUTIONS THAT YOU ACTUALLY

00:48:04.715 --> 00:48:07.184
HAVE. IN SOME WAYS- DIRECT

00:48:07.251 --> 00:48:09.152
AUTHORITY OVER IN TERMS OF THEIR

00:48:09.219 --> 00:48:10.954
APPROVAL SO. HOPEFULLY THAT'S

00:48:11.021 --> 00:48:12.689
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN TRACK- I

00:48:12.756 --> 00:48:14.224
REALIZE THAT THE DATA PERHAPS

00:48:14.291 --> 00:48:15.058
WASN'T BEING CHECKED BEFORE

00:48:15.125 --> 00:48:16.793
CODED BUT- PERHAPS THAT'S

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:18.762
SOMETHING THE FORD. AND I I'LL I

00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:20.530
ALSO APPRECIATE THAT. CLINICAL

00:48:20.597 --> 00:48:22.933
SITES- CHALLENGER TRAGICAL SITES

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.167
IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S ISOLATED

00:48:24.234 --> 00:48:26.003
NURSING PROFESSION ALONE I KNOW

00:48:26.069 --> 00:48:27.304
IT'S A ISSUE IN THE MEDICINE

00:48:27.371 --> 00:48:29.172
SIDE UP FOR MEDICAL STUDENTS.

00:48:29.239 --> 00:48:35.679
RESIDENTS. ITSELF FOR OTHER

00:48:35.746 --> 00:48:37.581
HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS AS SO

00:48:37.648 --> 00:48:38.315
THE THIS IS A THERE A LARGE

00:48:38.382 --> 00:48:40.217
TOWN. THAT WE NEED TO THINK. IN

00:48:40.284 --> 00:48:42.686
TERMS OF THE- OBLIGATION AND-

00:48:42.753 --> 00:48:44.054
AND WHAT WE EXPECT OF OUR

00:48:44.121 --> 00:48:44.688
HEALTHCARE INSTITUTIONS PROVIDE

00:48:44.755 --> 00:48:45.322
CLINICAL TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES

00:48:45.389 --> 00:48:46.490
FOR TRAINEES- AS WELL SELVES-

00:48:46.556 --> 00:48:50.027
JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT- AND ALSO

00:48:50.093 --> 00:48:51.828
PREVIEWED THE DISCUSSION ABOUT-

00:48:51.895 --> 00:48:52.596
SIMULATION I WILL I WILL JUST

00:48:52.663 --> 00:48:53.997
MAKE ME WANT CALM ABOUT

00:48:54.064 --> 00:48:56.033
SIMULATION. WE HAVE SOME REALLY

00:48:56.099 --> 00:48:59.036
AMAZING SIMULATIONS NOW. BUT

00:48:59.102 --> 00:49:01.638
WELL YES IT CAN TO A CERTAIN

00:49:01.705 --> 00:49:02.539
EXTENT IT'S NOT LIKE FLYING A

00:49:02.606 --> 00:49:05.509
PLANE AND ACTUALLY HAVING ACTUAL

00:49:05.575 --> 00:49:06.576
INTERACTIONS WITH PATIENTS EVEN

00:49:06.643 --> 00:49:08.178
WITH VERY LITTLE REALISTIC

00:49:08.245 --> 00:49:10.614
SIMULATIONS. YOU DO NEED TO HAVE

00:49:10.681 --> 00:49:12.449
DIRECT PATIENT INTERACTION- IT

00:49:12.516 --> 00:49:14.217
DUFFY SUBSTITUTES FOR THAT SO

00:49:14.284 --> 00:49:16.019
I'M NOT OPPOSED TO SIMULATION

00:49:16.086 --> 00:49:17.888
HAVING MORE SIMULATION BUT THERE

00:49:17.954 --> 00:49:18.789
ARE LIMITS TO HOW FAR

00:49:18.855 --> 00:49:20.657
STIMULATION CAN GO. ESPECIALLY

00:49:20.724 --> 00:49:23.160
WHEN IT COMES TO YOU KNOW THAT

00:49:23.226 --> 00:49:24.528
PERSONAL INTERACTION OF SOCIAL

00:49:24.594 --> 00:49:25.162
INTERACTION. RIGHT YOU CAN LEARN

00:49:25.228 --> 00:49:26.296
THE PHYSIOLOGY ALL THAT OTHER

00:49:26.363 --> 00:49:28.565
STUFF ON A ON A SIMULATOR BUT

00:49:28.632 --> 00:49:30.600
IT'S- IT. SIMULATOR

00:49:30.667 --> 00:49:32.269
UNFORTUNATELY CAN'T TELL YOU A

00:49:32.336 --> 00:49:33.837
REAL LIFE STORY ABOUT SOMEONE'S

00:49:33.904 --> 00:49:35.339
LIFE AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS

00:49:35.405 --> 00:49:38.141
AFFECTED THEM THAT. TAKING CARE

00:49:38.208 --> 00:49:39.976
OF AN ACTUAL PATIENTS ACCOUNT SO

00:49:40.043 --> 00:49:41.778
I'M JUST GONNA PUT THAT OUT

00:49:41.845 --> 00:49:43.814
THERE- I ABSOLUTELY AGREE

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:45.749
THAT'S- HUGE YOU. KNOW AS PART

00:49:45.816 --> 00:49:47.417
OF YOUR ASSESSMENT AND THAT'S

00:49:47.484 --> 00:49:48.985
KIND OF A DISGUSTING TOPIC. BUT

00:49:49.052 --> 00:49:51.822
IT JUST GOES ON HANDS ON IT

00:49:51.888 --> 00:49:52.889
GETTING THAT SENSE WHEN YOU WALK

00:49:52.956 --> 00:49:54.424
IN THE ROOM HE WATCHED. THEM

00:49:54.491 --> 00:49:57.961
GUARD YOU KNOW ALL OF THAT. YOU

00:49:58.028 --> 00:49:58.995
GET THAT MESSAGE. OKAY ALL RIGHT

00:49:59.062 --> 00:50:01.698
SO- SO I'M GONNA GET TO SOME

00:50:01.765 --> 00:50:03.600
QUESTIONS. OTHER QUESTIONS- SO

00:50:03.667 --> 00:50:08.505
FIRST OF ALL- IN. OUR IN OUR

00:50:08.572 --> 00:50:10.073
BACKGROUND PAPER- DON'T. AND

00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:11.942
AGAIN YOUR- ABOUT PROGRESS THE-

00:50:12.008 --> 00:50:13.844
B. R. AND HAS MADE- I DID WANT

00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:15.879
TO FOLLOW UP ON A COUPLE OF

00:50:15.946 --> 00:50:16.446
ISSUES THAT ARE RELATED TO

00:50:16.513 --> 00:50:18.482
AUDITS SO- ISSUE NUMBER SIX

00:50:18.548 --> 00:50:20.751
THERE'S A WHISTLE BLOWER ON IT.

00:50:20.817 --> 00:50:21.785
IT WAS NOT IN THE BACKGROUND

00:50:21.852 --> 00:50:24.187
PAPER RECOMMENDATION THREE I WAS

00:50:24.254 --> 00:50:25.689
KIND OF STILL FLOATING OUT THERE

00:50:25.756 --> 00:50:27.457
AND THINK THE BEER AND CLAIMS

00:50:27.524 --> 00:50:28.024
THE FINISH THEY FULLY

00:50:28.091 --> 00:50:29.259
IMPLEMENTED THERE'S SOME BACK

00:50:29.326 --> 00:50:31.862
AND FORTH WITH THE- IDEA OF THE-

00:50:31.928 --> 00:50:33.563
AUDITOR WHETHER IT ACTUALLY IT'S

00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:35.132
BEEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED- CAN YOU

00:50:35.198 --> 00:50:37.601
JUST STATE. WHAT IS WHAT'S THE

00:50:37.667 --> 00:50:38.802
CURRENT SITUATION WITH

00:50:38.869 --> 00:50:40.837
IMPLEMENTATION OF RECOMMENDATION

00:50:40.904 --> 00:50:42.305
THREE RELATED TO THE WHISTLE

00:50:42.372 --> 00:50:45.942
BLOWER ON IT OF I THINK TWENTY

00:50:46.009 --> 00:50:47.110
SIXTEEN. SO THAT'S THAT TWO

00:50:47.177 --> 00:50:49.279
SEPARATE- THINGS THERE SO I

00:50:49.346 --> 00:50:50.414
EXPLAINED THAT. ON THE WHISTLE

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:51.948
BLOWER ON IT THERE WAS THREE

00:50:52.015 --> 00:50:53.750
RECOMMENDATIONS THOSE THREE

00:50:53.817 --> 00:50:54.751
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE FULLY

00:50:54.818 --> 00:50:56.787
IMPLEMENTED AND IT IS REFLECTED

00:50:56.853 --> 00:50:58.288
ON THE CSA WEBSITE.

00:50:58.355 --> 00:51:00.891
RECOMMENDATION THREE YEP MANSION

00:51:00.957 --> 00:51:03.226
BACK. TO THE AUDIT THAT OCCURRED

00:51:03.293 --> 00:51:04.361
IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND-

00:51:04.428 --> 00:51:06.129
SPECIFICALLY TALKING ABOUT

00:51:06.196 --> 00:51:09.499
NUMBER SEVEN. B. WILL NOT. SHOW

00:51:09.566 --> 00:51:10.767
THAT IS FULLY IMPLEMENTED

00:51:10.834 --> 00:51:12.068
BECAUSE OF THE FRAUD THAT WAS

00:51:12.135 --> 00:51:13.570
COMPLETED. SO WE'RE

00:51:13.637 --> 00:51:15.138
UNDERSTANDING THAT EVEN THOUGH

00:51:15.205 --> 00:51:17.174
WE FULLY IMPLEMENTED ALL THREE

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:18.141
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE

00:51:18.208 --> 00:51:20.710
WHISTLEBLOWER AUDIT. THAT CSA

00:51:20.777 --> 00:51:23.246
WILL NOT UPDATE NUMBER SEVEN TO

00:51:23.313 --> 00:51:25.148
SHOW THAT THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED

00:51:25.215 --> 00:51:29.186
UNTIL THEY DO AN ADDITIONAL. ON

00:51:29.252 --> 00:51:31.555
IT OKAY AND THERE'S ON. DO YOU

00:51:31.621 --> 00:51:33.723
KNOW THAT ON GO RIGHT NOW OR

AN ASSISTANT INSTRUCTOR THEY DO

00:56:29.018 --> 00:56:30.954

00:56:41.064 --> 00:56:42.932
ALIGNMENT WITH THAT. WEIGHT IS

00:56:42.999 --> 00:56:45.001
DIFFERENT AND WHAT THE CREDITORS

00:56:45.068 --> 00:56:46.269

TEACH WHATEVER YOU WANT. WELL

00:56:51.074 --> 00:56:53.309
NCSP AND THE NATIONAL COUNCIL

STATE WORD NURSING HAS RESEARCH

HAVING RECENCY AND SUBJECT

00:56:58.481 --> 00:57:00.383

NURSE TO TEACH OBSTETRICS. BABY

00:57:05.655 --> 00:57:07.157
WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TEACH THAT

00:57:07.223 --> 00:57:09.859
CONTENT LIKEWISE YOU WOULD NOT

00:57:09.926 --> 00:57:11.494
WANT SOMEBODY THAT IS A

YOU NEED TO HAVE THOSE CONTENT

00:57:16.399 --> 00:57:19.135
AREAS THAT THEY ARE RECENT AND

00:57:19.202 --> 00:57:21.304
EQUIVALENT TO THAT OF A BEDSIDE

00:57:21.371 --> 00:57:22.939
NURSE. SO WE DO THAT APPROVAL

00:57:23.006 --> 00:57:24.674
PROCESS. ADDITIONALLY

00:57:24.741 --> 00:57:27.010
ACCREDITORS REQUIRE A MASTER'S

00:57:27.076 --> 00:57:29.779

00:57:29.846 --> 00:57:31.981

A MASTERS AND GET THAT

00:57:38.154 --> 00:57:40.023
EXPERIENCE REALLY HELPED THAT

00:57:40.089 --> 00:57:41.891
PIPELINE. BUT TEACHERS WE HAVE A

00:57:41.958 --> 00:57:51.000
FACULTY SHORTAGE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:57:51.067 --> 00:57:52.168
WHAT OUR BOARD DOES IS WE ARE

00:57:52.235 --> 00:57:54.404
ALLOW FOR SO DEGREE COMPARED. TO

00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:56.072

HELP DRESSING CHANGES. WE HAVE A

00:57:59.175 --> 00:58:00.143
CALL BACK MEMBER PRESS. WE ALSO

00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:02.011
THE ABILITY WHERE THEY CAN ENTER

ASSISTANT INSTRUCTOR THEY CAN DO

00:58:04.547 --> 00:58:06.182
A COMPLETE CLINICAL ROTATION

00:58:06.249 --> 00:58:08.017
THAT'S WHAT THEIR EXPERTISE IS

00:58:08.084 --> 00:58:09.853
THAT THE BAD SIDE. AND THEY

00:58:09.919 --> 00:58:11.087
REPORT BACK TO YOU A FACULTY

00:58:11.154 --> 00:58:12.655

NURSE. AND THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE

00:58:16.626 --> 00:58:18.127
THAT MANAGING ON THAT COURSE

00:58:18.194 --> 00:58:20.163
THEY GET THE GRADES THEY MAKE

00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:21.998
THAT CURRICULUM PLAN. THEY MAKE

00:58:22.065 --> 00:58:23.800
SURE THAT IT MEETS THE GRADUATE

00:58:23.867 --> 00:58:26.436
OBJECTIVES ETCETERA SO THE BOARD

00:58:26.502 --> 00:58:29.038
ACTUALLY HAS MORE ENTRY POINTS

00:58:29.105 --> 00:58:30.540
INTO BEING A FACULTY MEMBER TO

00:58:30.607 --> 00:58:32.442
ADDRESS THE FACULTY SHORTAGE.

00:58:32.508 --> 00:58:34.844
THEN THE ACCREDITOR AGENCY DOES

AND WE ARE IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE

00:58:36.846 --> 00:58:38.314

01:00:36.332 --> 01:00:37.834
HEALTH RIGHT NOW THEY'RE NOT

01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:39.168
GOING TO DO THE DANCE STUFF AND

01:00:39.235 --> 01:00:43.306
YOU NEED TO. SO I. WE'RE TRYING

01:00:43.373 --> 01:00:45.775
TO BE OUT HOW TO BUILD BROAD

01:00:45.842 --> 01:00:46.809
PIPELINE. IN IF ONE OF THE-

01:00:46.876 --> 01:00:48.277
NARROW CHOKE POINTS AS WE CAN'T

01:00:48.344 --> 01:00:50.480
GET ENOUGH FACULTY YURI HAVE

01:00:50.546 --> 01:00:51.147
CHALLENGES WITH NO PAY AND OTHER

01:00:51.214 --> 01:00:52.382
TYPES OF THINGS. I WAS ON THE

01:00:52.448 --> 01:00:54.317
SHOW WERE NOT PUT IN REGULATIONS

01:00:54.384 --> 01:00:55.785
OR STANDARDS IN PLACE THAT-

01:00:55.852 --> 01:00:59.055
WOULD. RESTRICT THE CAPACITY OF

01:00:59.122 --> 01:01:00.056
SCHOOLS WHILE STILL MAINTAINING

01:01:00.123 --> 01:01:01.124
OF COURSE CERTAINLY THE HIGH

01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:02.592
QUALITY EDUCATION WE DON'T WANT

01:01:02.658 --> 01:01:04.761
TO COMPROMISE THAT. BUT- SO I

01:01:04.827 --> 01:01:05.995
JUST GONNA PUT THAT OUT THERE.

01:01:06.062 --> 01:01:08.097
CERTAINLY THAT'S AN ISSUE BUT I

01:01:08.164 --> 01:01:09.999
THINK HOPEFULLY AND AGAIN.

01:01:10.066 --> 01:01:11.000
YOU'RE WORKING WITH THE

01:01:11.067 --> 01:01:14.437
GRADATION BODIES AS WELL- BILL

01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:15.138
TO THINK ABOUT WHAT

01:01:15.204 --> 01:01:16.539
FLEXIBILITIES IN MY BUILDING AND

01:01:16.606 --> 01:01:18.141
WHAT THE TRUE IMPACT WOULD HAVE

01:01:18.207 --> 01:01:19.208
I'M SURE YOU DO. IT WOULD

01:01:19.275 --> 01:01:21.177
ACTUALLY HAVE ON THEIR EDUCATION

01:01:21.244 --> 01:01:22.879
RIGHT AND SO I JUST WANNA TO YOU

01:01:22.945 --> 01:01:24.981
KNOW. HAVE A THINK ABOUT THAT.

01:01:25.048 --> 01:01:26.382
YEAH ONE OTHER THING THAT WE

01:01:26.449 --> 01:01:28.117
ACTUALLY JUST DID WERE MOVING

01:01:28.184 --> 01:01:29.886
TOWARDS IT THIS MONTH IS

01:01:29.952 --> 01:01:31.554
SUPPOSED TO BE IMPLEMENTED SO.

01:01:31.621 --> 01:01:34.023
I'M GONNA PUT MY CARD FOR THE X.

01:01:34.090 --> 01:01:36.659
WE ARE DOING A ONE TIME FACULTY

01:01:36.726 --> 01:01:39.962
APPROVAL. THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN

01:01:40.029 --> 01:01:40.596
WHAT WE'VE DONE ASKED AND THAT

01:01:40.663 --> 01:01:42.031
WAS BASED ON FEEDBACK FROM OUR

01:01:42.098 --> 01:01:43.766
DIRECTORS. SO WHAT HAPPENED IN

01:01:43.833 --> 01:01:48.871
THE PAST IF YOU TAUGHT. AT-

01:01:48.938 --> 01:01:49.906
GETTING A STATE UNIV. YOU WERE.

01:01:49.972 --> 01:01:51.174
BUT THEY IF YOU WANT TO. STATE

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:53.576
UNIV. YOU WOULD HAVE TO GET

01:01:53.643 --> 01:01:54.277
ANOTHER WE ARE ABLE WE'RE

01:01:54.343 --> 01:01:55.745
ELIMINATING. AND IT'S A- ONE

01:01:55.812 --> 01:01:57.080
TIME APPROVAL AND THAT WILL

01:01:57.146 --> 01:01:59.415
ACTUALLY BE ADDED TO OUR BREEZE

01:01:59.482 --> 01:02:01.150
LICENSE LOOK UP. SAME IS EXACTLY

01:02:01.217 --> 01:02:02.518
CORRECTLY. BY THE END OF THIS

01:02:02.585 --> 01:02:03.986
MONTH AND EVERYTHING GOES

01:02:04.053 --> 01:02:06.022
SMOOTHLY. SO THAT WILL HELP TO

01:02:06.089 --> 01:02:08.124
DECREASE THAT BUREAUCRACY OKAY

01:02:08.191 --> 01:02:10.226
THAT'S WONDERFUL WONDERFUL HERE-

01:02:10.293 --> 01:02:11.994
ANOTHER PART OF EDUCATION I

01:02:12.061 --> 01:02:12.728
ALWAYS ASK MY CONTINUING

01:02:12.795 --> 01:02:15.665
EDUCATION- NOW I UNDERSTAND.

01:02:15.731 --> 01:02:16.399
YOU'RE FROM MY READ THE

01:02:16.466 --> 01:02:18.034
BACKGROUND PAPER YOU'RE ONLY

01:02:18.101 --> 01:02:19.368
DOING C. AUDITED THERE'S

01:02:19.435 --> 01:02:20.937
COMPLAINTS WHICH IS DIFFERENT

01:02:21.003 --> 01:02:22.505
THAN OTHER BOARDS WHICH

01:02:22.572 --> 01:02:24.273
ACTUALLY. DID DOES A C. E. YOU

01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:27.577
KNOW THEY DO A SAMPLE TO REVIEW-

01:02:27.643 --> 01:02:29.412
AND- AND OF COURSE THERE'S NO

01:02:29.479 --> 01:02:31.647
REPORT ON COMPLIANCE RATE SO I

01:02:31.714 --> 01:02:36.619
MEAN- SO. I MEAN. SO I GUESS MY

01:02:36.686 --> 01:02:37.186
QUESTION IS THAT WHY ARE WE

01:02:37.253 --> 01:02:40.022
DOING TO MONITOR C. E. AND THEN

01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:41.791
ALSO IN ADDITION. BECAUSE

01:02:41.858 --> 01:02:43.793
THEY'RE BORED OVER ALSO PROVES

01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:45.261
THE C. E. ITSELF- AND I THINK

01:02:45.328 --> 01:02:47.497
THERE HAVE BEEN ISSUES IN THE

01:02:47.563 --> 01:02:48.531
PAST ABOUT. SOME OF THE YOU

01:02:48.598 --> 01:02:50.299
KNOW. QUALITY OF THE C. E. R. X.

01:02:50.366 --> 01:02:53.102
A CALL IS NOT THE RIGHT WORD

01:02:53.169 --> 01:02:54.470
BUT- I GUESS. AND I'VE ASKED IN

01:02:54.537 --> 01:02:55.571
THE PAST- DO YOU HAVE STANDARDS

01:02:55.638 --> 01:02:57.573
FOR CONFLICT OF INTEREST WHEN IT

01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:59.175
COMES TO TEACHING C. COURSES BE

01:02:59.242 --> 01:03:00.009
SURE THERE'S A CONFLICT OF

01:03:00.076 --> 01:03:01.777
INTEREST OF THE PERSON WHO'S

01:03:01.844 --> 01:03:02.411
TEACHING ARE SPONSORING THE C.

E. IN TERMS OF PROVIDING EARLY.

01:03:06.015 --> 01:03:07.517
DISCLOSURE OF POTENTIAL

01:03:07.583 --> 01:03:09.519
CONFLICTS AS WELL SO- FIRST OF

01:03:09.585 --> 01:03:11.888
ALL C. E. AUDITS. AND ALSO-

01:03:11.954 --> 01:03:14.824
COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS

01:03:14.891 --> 01:03:15.458
CONTINUE EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS

01:03:15.525 --> 01:03:17.193
AND THEN. S. GIVING APPROVAL

ROLE- CONFLICT OF INTEREST.

01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:21.797
REGARDING CONTINUING EDUCATION.

01:03:21.864 --> 01:03:24.133
OKAY I THINK I GOT ALL THAT. THE

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:27.670
FIRST ONE IS. I'MNOT SURE IF IT

01:03:27.737 --> 01:03:29.238
WAS NOT CLEAR IN OUR SUNSET

01:03:29.305 --> 01:03:31.941
BACKGROUND- PAPER BUT WE DO.

01:03:32.008 --> 01:03:34.076
RANDOM AUDITS WE ABSOLUTELY DO

01:03:34.143 --> 01:03:42.251

01:03:42.318 --> 01:03:44.086

FROM THERE SEE YEARS. THAT'S NOT

01:04:20.389 --> 01:04:22.725
A HARD STOP BECAUSE WE DON'T

THEY'RE FOCUSED ON SOMETHING

01:05:04.867 --> 01:05:06.435
DIFFERENT. WHAT THAT ALSO DOES

01:05:06.502 --> 01:05:08.204
FOR US IT ALLOWS US TO JUST DO A

01:05:08.271 --> 01:05:09.805
RANDOM MY AUDIT BY PULLING THE

01:05:09.872 --> 01:05:12.341

01:09:06.876 --> 01:09:10.045
IN THIS PARTICULAR SETTING

01:09:10.112 --> 01:09:11.180
CALIFORNIA UNIQUE IN THAT REGARD

01:09:11.247 --> 01:09:12.681
. WHAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT NURSING

01:09:12.748 --> 01:09:16.352
EDUCATION. THAT REQUIRES THE

01:09:16.418 --> 01:09:19.321

A NATIONAL COUNCIL STATE BOARD

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:35.671

01:09:35.738 --> 01:09:39.141
EVERYTHING NATIONWIDE- AND

01:09:39.208 --> 01:09:41.110
WORLDWIDE SO THEY HAD EVIDENCE

AUSTRALIA END OF OURS IN SO

01:09:48.984 --> 01:09:50.553
BASED ON THAT OVERWHELMING

01:09:50.619 --> 01:09:52.555
WEALTH AND EVIDENCE THEY ARE

01:09:52.621 --> 01:09:54.223
ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT THE

01:09:54.290 --> 01:09:56.525
SUCCESS OF A PROGRAM REALLY LIES

01:09:56.592 --> 01:09:58.761
WITH THE FACULTY AND THE ABILITY

01:09:58.827 --> 01:10:01.330
OF THE FACULTY TO BE FULL TIME.

01:10:01.397 --> 01:10:03.332
THEY HAVE A LOW TURNOVER RATE

01:10:03.399 --> 01:10:05.467
HAVE A LOW TURNOVER RATE AT THE-

01:10:05.534 --> 01:10:07.803

01:10:10.306 --> 01:10:12.341
THE CONTENT THAT THEY TEACH SO

01:10:12.408 --> 01:10:15.110
BASED ON THAT THE FACULTY IS

01:10:15.177 --> 01:10:17.913
WHAT SETS UP THE SUCCESS FOR THE

01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:22.151

OTHER HEALTH COVERAGE AND- IS

01:10:25.087 --> 01:10:26.221
IT. AND ISN'T THAT SOMETHING

01:10:26.288 --> 01:10:27.556
THAT THESE NURSING PROGRAMS ARE

01:10:27.623 --> 01:10:30.259
ROUTINELY. AND FACTOR REQUIRED

01:10:30.326 --> 01:10:31.727
TO BE ACCREDITED SO ISN'T THAT

01:10:31.794 --> 01:10:32.995
SOMETHING THAT AN ACCREDITING

01:10:33.062 --> 01:10:35.631

RENEWAL OF ACCREDITATION. A

01:10:43.706 --> 01:10:45.908

THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED TO BE

01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:48.611
ACCREDITED AND IN FACT THE

01:10:48.677 --> 01:10:51.080
STATISTICS THAT NCS COLLECTED

01:10:59.755 --> 01:11:01.223
THAT'S WITH US WE DO NOT HAVE A

01:11:01.290 --> 01:11:05.461

01:12:40.422 --> 01:12:41.423
AN EIGHT YEAR CYCLE FOR

01:12:41.490 --> 01:12:43.092
CONTINUING APPROVAL VISIT OR A

01:12:43.158 --> 01:12:45.194
TEN YEAR CYCLE. WE HAVE MOVED TO

01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:47.329
THE EIGHT AND TEN YEAR CYCLE FOR

01:12:47.396 --> 01:12:48.430
THOSE PROGRAMS. THE ONES THAT

01:12:48.497 --> 01:12:50.566
ARE NOT ACCREDITED WE CONTINUED

01:12:50.632 --> 01:12:51.433
WITH OUR FIVE YEAR CYCLE OF

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:53.368
REVIEW. I MEAN MASS MARKET WE'RE

01:12:53.435 --> 01:12:56.338
TALKING ABOUT FACULTY APPROVAL

01:12:56.405 --> 01:12:57.840
HERE. BACK T. APPROVALS ARE PART

01:12:57.906 --> 01:13:00.008
OF THAT AND I'M NOT SURE IF YOU

01:13:00.075 --> 01:13:01.610
KIND OF PROBABLY SPOKE TOO FAST

01:13:01.677 --> 01:13:03.712
AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT- WHEN I

01:13:03.779 --> 01:13:06.381
WAS TALKING TO DOCTOR CAN. I

01:13:06.448 --> 01:13:08.050
MENTIONED THAT WE ARE

01:13:08.117 --> 01:13:10.152
IMPLEMENTING A ONE TIME FACULTY

01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:13.021
APPROVAL THAT'S A HUGE HUGE

01:13:13.088 --> 01:13:14.490
CHANGE FROM WHAT WE'VE DONE IN

01:13:14.556 --> 01:13:16.492
THE PAST IN THE PAST WE USED TO

01:13:16.558 --> 01:13:18.327
DO THAT FOR EVERY SCHOOL. AND

01:13:18.393 --> 01:13:19.328
NOW WE'RE IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE

01:13:19.394 --> 01:13:20.963
TEACHING CREDENTIAL BOARD AND

01:13:21.029 --> 01:13:21.630
JUST LIKE THE TEACHING

01:13:21.697 --> 01:13:22.998
CREDENTIAL BOARD AS A SINGLE

01:13:23.065 --> 01:13:25.834
SUBJECT OR MULTIPLE SUBJECTS. WE

01:13:25.901 --> 01:13:27.636
ARE IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE FACTS

01:13:27.703 --> 01:13:29.638
AND SO. WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT

01:13:29.705 --> 01:13:32.074
THE OTHER SCHOOLS AND IN THOSE-

01:13:32.141 --> 01:13:34.109
AREAS THAT HAVE ACCREDITATION.

01:13:34.176 --> 01:13:35.911
AND THE OTHER BOARDS IN GIRLS

01:13:35.978 --> 01:13:37.312
THEY PARTNER WITH THE TEACHING

01:13:37.379 --> 01:13:39.081
CREDENTIALING BOARD AS WELL SO

01:13:39.148 --> 01:13:40.315
THAT THEY ALREADY HAVE

01:13:40.382 --> 01:13:42.050
CREDENTIALED TEACHERS. WE DON'T

01:13:42.117 --> 01:13:43.352
DO THAT WE ARE THE TEACHING

01:13:43.418 --> 01:13:45.020
CREDENTIALING BOARD FOR THE FOR

01:13:45.087 --> 01:13:46.155
THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING

01:13:46.221 --> 01:13:48.257
FOR THAT. SO THAT'S WHY WE HAVE

01:13:48.323 --> 01:13:49.324
THAT DUAL ROLE WE DON'T HAVE

01:13:49.391 --> 01:13:50.325
ANOTHER BOARD THAT IS

01:13:50.392 --> 01:13:52.427
POTENTIALLY OUR TEACHERS WE DO

01:13:52.494 --> 01:13:54.263
THAT SO HOPEFULLY THAT KIND OF

01:13:54.329 --> 01:13:55.731
CLEARS THAT UP A LITTLE BIT. AND

01:13:55.798 --> 01:13:57.099
WITH THE APPROVAL VISITS THE

01:13:57.166 --> 01:13:59.067
APPROVAL VISITS DON'T ARE SORRY

01:13:59.134 --> 01:14:00.736
FOR ANY PATIENT VISITS DON'T

01:14:00.803 --> 01:14:03.739
OCCUR PRIOR TO PROGRAM. WE DO A

01:14:03.806 --> 01:14:08.977
PROGRAM APPROVAL. IT CREDIT EACH

01:14:09.044 --> 01:14:11.313
. I HEAR LATER. WE THREE YEARS

01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:13.682
LATER TENURE LATER SO WE THE

01:14:13.749 --> 01:14:14.917
MEAN THERE NOT ACCREDITED THEY

01:14:14.983 --> 01:14:16.185
ARE APPROVED THEY NEED TO HAVE

01:14:16.251 --> 01:14:19.121
SOME SORT OF FACULTY APPROVAL TO

01:14:19.188 --> 01:14:20.923
MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO

01:14:20.989 --> 01:14:22.224
TEACH OUR STUDENTS AND SO IT'S

01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:23.792
VERY COMPLEX THE USED TO RETREAT

01:14:23.859 --> 01:14:26.061
DO YOU STILL READ DOES THE BOARD

01:14:26.128 --> 01:14:27.830
STILL RETAIN APPROVAL AUTHORITY.

01:14:27.896 --> 01:14:31.633
OVER NURSING PROGRAM DIRECTOR

01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:32.968
HIRES AT INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS-

01:14:33.035 --> 01:14:34.469
NURSING PROGRAMS YES WE DO IS

01:14:34.536 --> 01:14:35.971
SIMILAR TO THE TEACHING

01:14:36.038 --> 01:14:38.073
CREDENTIALING BOARD RIGHT-

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:41.043
INSULT MY QUESTION MY QUESTION.

01:14:41.109 --> 01:14:43.779
MY QUESTION IS THIS AND YOU CAN

01:14:43.846 --> 01:14:46.048
TELL I'M NOT PARTICULARLY- A

01:14:46.114 --> 01:14:47.883
SUPPORTER OF THIS PIECE OF

01:14:47.950 --> 01:14:52.287
REPARATION I AGREE WHEN YOU HAVE

01:14:52.354 --> 01:14:53.956
. A PUBLIC SCHOOL FOR EXAMPLE

01:14:54.022 --> 01:14:55.123
BECAUSE YOU DON'T DIFFERENTIATE

01:14:55.190 --> 01:14:57.159
BETWEEN PUBLIC SCHOOLS BETWEEN

01:14:57.226 --> 01:14:58.827
THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY

01:14:58.894 --> 01:15:00.863
PROGRAMS BETWEEN OUR COMMUNITY

01:15:00.929 --> 01:15:03.165
COLLEGE PROGRAMS AND- SOME OTHER

01:15:03.232 --> 01:15:04.299
PROGRAM THAT'S ON A STREET

01:15:04.366 --> 01:15:05.534
CORNER SOMEWHERE THAT'S TURNING

01:15:05.601 --> 01:15:07.936
OUT QUALITY NURSES. SO WHEN YOU

01:15:08.003 --> 01:15:09.371
HAVE A PROGRAM IN A PUBLIC

01:15:09.438 --> 01:15:11.206
SCHOOL WITH THE WITH THE CUT

01:15:11.273 --> 01:15:13.208
COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT

01:15:13.275 --> 01:15:14.710
WITH THE DEAN OF A MEDICAL

01:15:14.776 --> 01:15:16.678
SCHOOL ALL APPROPRIATE

01:15:16.745 --> 01:15:17.946
APPROPRIATELY CREDENTIALED

01:15:18.013 --> 01:15:18.814
BECAUSE THE YOUR THE

01:15:18.881 --> 01:15:20.449
INSTITUTIONAL ACCREDITATION

01:15:20.515 --> 01:15:24.019
REQUIRES THAT. FOR PROGRAMMATIC

01:15:24.086 --> 01:15:25.087
ACCREDITATION IF THE SCHOOL HAS

01:15:25.153 --> 01:15:27.890
THAT. AND YOU HAVE A FACULTY

01:15:27.956 --> 01:15:29.625
ASSOCIATION AND IN MANY CASES.

01:15:29.691 --> 01:15:32.594
FRANKLY LABOR REPRESENTATIVES

01:15:32.661 --> 01:15:35.430
FOR THE TEACHING FACULTY. WHY IS

01:15:35.497 --> 01:15:37.099
IT IS CRITICAL THAT THE NURSING

01:15:37.165 --> 01:15:39.635
BOARD APPROVED NURSING PROGRAM

01:15:39.701 --> 01:15:41.904
DIRECTORS IN EACH OF THESE

01:15:41.970 --> 01:15:44.306
SCHOOLS APPROVE THE HIRING. AS

01:15:44.373 --> 01:15:46.208
PART OF THE HIRING PROCESS I

01:15:46.275 --> 01:15:50.746
DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT. C. H.

01:15:50.812 --> 01:15:55.384
AGAIN IT GOESBACK TO IN RTP

01:15:55.450 --> 01:15:57.920
WITH TEACHERS THEY HAVE A

01:15:57.986 --> 01:16:00.555
APPROVAL PROCESS THEY WORK HARD

01:16:00.622 --> 01:16:01.590
THROUGH EDUCATION AND

01:16:01.657 --> 01:16:03.358
PREPARATION TO GET A PRELIMINARY

01:16:03.425 --> 01:16:05.127
TEACHING CREDENTIALS THEY DO THE

01:16:05.193 --> 01:16:06.695
SAME THING THEN GET A PERMANENT

01:16:06.762 --> 01:16:07.996
TEACHING CREDENTIAL YOU CAN ONLY

01:16:08.063 --> 01:16:09.364
HAVE THE PRELIMINARY ONE FOR

01:16:09.431 --> 01:16:11.033
THREE YEARS AND THEN YOU CAN

01:16:11.099 --> 01:16:12.267
HAVE A TEACHING CREDENTIAL AND

01:16:12.334 --> 01:16:13.468
THAT NEEDS TO BE RENEWED EVERY

01:16:13.535 --> 01:16:15.337
FIVE YEARS IT'S IDENTICAL SQUARE

01:16:15.404 --> 01:16:16.772
RECENCY PROCESS. THEY ALSO AS

01:16:16.838 --> 01:16:18.674
THE TEACHER BOARD THEY

01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:21.176
CREDENTIAL BEAR PRINCIPLES BUT

01:16:21.243 --> 01:16:22.444
THE SAME THING AS OUR DIRECTOR

01:16:22.511 --> 01:16:24.813
OF NURSING WHEN YOU LOOK AT

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:26.448
WHERE THEY ARE IN A STRANGE AND

01:16:26.515 --> 01:16:28.150
ALREADY WITH AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE

01:16:28.216 --> 01:16:30.218
IS NOT TRAINED IN A LOT OF

01:16:30.285 --> 01:16:31.219
THEORETICAL BACKGROUND AND

01:16:31.286 --> 01:16:32.854
THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY NOT TRAINED

01:16:32.921 --> 01:16:35.357
IN CURRICULAR DESIGN SO WHEN YOU

01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:37.059
GET A BACHELOR'S PREPARED NURSE

01:16:37.125 --> 01:16:38.894
YOU HAVE THEM AND THEY ARE GREAT

01:16:38.961 --> 01:16:41.263
THEY ARE TRAINED IN THEORETICAL-

01:16:41.330 --> 01:16:42.965
NURSING KNOWLEDGE BUT THEN WHEN

01:16:43.031 --> 01:16:44.466
YOU GET TO THE MASTER'S DEGREE.

01:16:44.533 --> 01:16:46.601
THAT MASTER'S DEGREE PERSON DOES

01:16:46.668 --> 01:16:49.404
HAVE CURRICULAR- INSIGHT THEY DO

01:16:49.471 --> 01:16:51.773
HAVE CLASSES AROUND THAT AND

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:54.910
THEY THEY THEN EARN BAD BILITY

01:16:54.977 --> 01:16:55.677
BUT THEY ALSO HAVE

01:16:55.744 --> 01:16:57.612
SPECIALIZATIONS IF YOU'RE GONNA

01:16:57.679 --> 01:16:59.448
HAVE A PERSON THAT WANTS TO

01:16:59.514 --> 01:17:02.250
SPECIALIZE AND DO A MASTERS IN

01:17:02.317 --> 01:17:04.252
NURSING BUT HAVE A FOCUS IN I.

01:17:04.319 --> 01:17:06.588
T. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE

01:17:06.655 --> 01:17:07.923
CURRICULAR DESIGN SO IT'S NOT

01:17:07.990 --> 01:17:10.025
JUST DEGREE SPECIFIC SO IT DOES

01:17:10.092 --> 01:17:13.362
REQUIRE REVIEW PROCESS. AND WE

01:17:13.428 --> 01:17:15.630
ARE IN ALIGNMENT WITH THAT EIGHT

01:17:15.697 --> 01:17:17.966
I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE LOOKING

01:17:18.033 --> 01:17:20.202
FOR EFFICIENCIES WE ARE AS WELL

01:17:20.268 --> 01:17:22.371
I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WANT TO

01:17:22.437 --> 01:17:23.171
DECREASE THE BURDEN ON OUR

01:17:23.238 --> 01:17:24.639
NURSING PROGRAM DIRECTORS I HEAR

01:17:24.706 --> 01:17:26.208
YOU ON THAT I WANT TO DO THE

01:17:26.274 --> 01:17:28.410
SAME THING AND SO DOES OUR FORD

01:17:28.477 --> 01:17:29.578
WE'VE HAD THESE CONVERSATIONS

01:17:29.644 --> 01:17:32.047
AND WE VOTED ON THESE WITHIN-

01:17:32.114 --> 01:17:34.649
OUR BOARD MEETINGS TO MAKE THESE

01:17:34.716 --> 01:17:36.718
THINGS AND ADDRESS THEM. SO

01:17:36.785 --> 01:17:37.753
WE'RE LOOKING AT THE

01:17:37.819 --> 01:17:38.920
EFFICIENCIES FOR TRYING TO

01:17:38.987 --> 01:17:40.489
DECREASE THAT BURDEN THE

01:17:40.555 --> 01:17:42.224
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN APPROVAL AND

01:17:42.290 --> 01:17:43.992
ACCREDITATION THAT ACCREDITORS

01:17:44.059 --> 01:17:53.568
VISITS AFTER THE APPROVAL IT CAN. BE YOURS IT IS NOT MANDATED

01:17:53.635 --> 01:17:55.237
FOR ANY OF OUR PRO TAB APPROVAL

01:17:55.303 --> 01:17:56.938
HEALTH. IN EVEN IF THEY BECOME

01:17:57.005 --> 01:17:58.807
AN APPROVED PROGRA. IT'S AN APT

01:17:58.874 --> 01:17:59.608
SITE DOES A CREDIT PROGRAMS

01:17:59.674 --> 01:18:01.309
REQUIRE THEM TO BE A ONE TIME

01:18:01.376 --> 01:18:03.278
APPROVAL FOR AN INSTRUCTOR AND

01:18:03.345 --> 01:18:04.913
LIKE I SHARED BEFORE YOU DON'T

01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:07.783
WANT. PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT

01:18:07.849 --> 01:18:10.252
CONTENT SPECIFIC CONTENT EXPERTS

01:18:10.318 --> 01:18:12.821
TO TEACH THE NEXT BREED AT THE

01:18:12.888 --> 01:18:15.123
NEXT- BATCH OF NURSES. COMING

01:18:15.190 --> 01:18:17.125
THROUGH THE PIPELINE. IF THEY'RE

01:18:17.192 --> 01:18:18.560
NOT ADEQUATELY PREPARED

01:18:18.627 --> 01:18:20.295
THEMSELVES AND THAT'S WHERE THAT

01:18:20.362 --> 01:18:23.665
PATIENT PROTECTION COMES FROM

01:18:23.732 --> 01:18:26.768
WELL UNDER HIS. I WILL WANT. MY

01:18:26.835 --> 01:18:28.370
WORDS USE ME I DON'T I WILL TELL

01:18:28.437 --> 01:18:30.639
YOU THIS IT APPEARS TO ME THAT

01:18:30.705 --> 01:18:32.474
THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING.

01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:34.676
HAS SORT OF AN IRON FISTED

01:18:34.743 --> 01:18:38.346
CONTROL OVER NURSING EDUCATION

01:18:38.413 --> 01:18:39.781
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND-

01:18:39.848 --> 01:18:41.750
MAYBE THAT'S OKAY IF THE SCHOOLS

01:18:41.817 --> 01:18:43.418
ACCEPTED I THINK YOU KNOW WHEN

01:18:43.485 --> 01:18:44.553
YOU'RE DEALING WITH THE

01:18:44.619 --> 01:18:45.854
CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY IN

01:18:45.921 --> 01:18:46.588
THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY

01:18:46.655 --> 01:18:49.357
COLLEGES. ALL OF THEM THOSE THAT

01:18:49.424 --> 01:18:51.660
HAVE NURSING PROGRAMS- I'M NOT

01:18:51.726 --> 01:18:53.495
SURE THAT THE THAT SORT OF

01:18:53.562 --> 01:18:55.597
CONTROL WELL THAT MIGHT HAVE

01:18:55.664 --> 01:18:56.431
BEEN APPROPRIATE TWENTY OR

01:18:56.498 --> 01:18:57.399
THIRTY YEARS AGO OR MAYBE LONGER

01:18:57.466 --> 01:18:59.167
I DON'T KNOW THE HISTORY. I'M

01:18:59.234 --> 01:19:00.335
NOT SURE THAT IT'S NECESSARILY

01:19:00.402 --> 01:19:01.670
APPROPRIATE TODAY AND IT'S

01:19:01.736 --> 01:19:03.538
CERTAINLY RESTRICTS FLEXIBILITY

01:19:03.605 --> 01:19:05.607
IT CERTAINLY AFFECTS THE TIMING

01:19:05.674 --> 01:19:07.909
OF DECISIONS- AND I'M NOT

01:19:07.976 --> 01:19:09.277
NECESSARILY SURE THAT THE BOARD

01:19:09.344 --> 01:19:11.480
OF REGISTERED NURSING. MAYBE WE

01:19:11.546 --> 01:19:12.614
SHOULD EXPLORE THIS HAS THE

01:19:12.681 --> 01:19:15.417
EXPERTISE NECESSARY TO DO THE

01:19:15.484 --> 01:19:17.252
KIND OF REVIEW THAT YOU'VE BEEN

01:19:17.319 --> 01:19:18.954
TALKING ABOUT TODAY PARTICULARLY

01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:22.057
GIVEN YOUR- NURSING EDUCATION

01:19:22.124 --> 01:19:24.226
COORDINATOR VACANCY RATE- AND

01:19:24.292 --> 01:19:26.394
PERHAPS SOME ADJUSTMENT TO SOME

01:19:26.461 --> 01:19:28.096
OF THE PROGRAMS WE'VE BEEN

01:19:28.163 --> 01:19:29.998
TALKING ABOUT WHAT EFFECT THAT

01:19:30.065 --> 01:19:31.433
NEC. VACANCY RATE AND THE NEED

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:33.168
FOR THE NUMBER OF ANY SEES THAT

01:19:33.235 --> 01:19:35.270
THE BOARD IS. HAS HAD TO CARRY

01:19:35.337 --> 01:19:36.972
ON THE ON THE BOOKS- IN YEARS

01:19:37.038 --> 01:19:38.607
PAST BUT LET ME JUMP AHEAD I

01:19:38.673 --> 01:19:40.442
DON'T MEAN TO BE DISRESPECTFUL.

01:19:40.509 --> 01:19:41.810
I'M JUST TRYING TO MOVE ALONG

01:19:41.877 --> 01:19:43.578
AND I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS.

01:19:43.645 --> 01:19:45.013
WITH RESPECT TO THE EDUCATION

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:47.382
PROGRAM APPROVAL I'VE ASKED THIS

01:19:47.449 --> 01:19:49.317
QUESTION BEFORE AND YOU YOU'VE

01:19:49.384 --> 01:19:52.487
MENTIONED THAT. NURSING PROGRAMS

01:19:52.554 --> 01:19:54.156
I GUESS THEY HAVE DIFFERENT.

01:19:54.222 --> 01:19:56.124
CURRICULA FROM PROGRAM TO

01:19:56.191 --> 01:19:59.561
PROGRAM AND- GIVEN THE IRON

01:19:59.628 --> 01:20:01.897
FISTED CONTROL THAT I PERCEIVE

01:20:01.963 --> 01:20:02.931
THE BOARD HAS OVER THESE

01:20:02.998 --> 01:20:05.467
PROGRAMS. WHY IN THE WORLD HAS

01:20:05.534 --> 01:20:07.602
THE BOARD NOT PUT OUT. THE

01:20:07.669 --> 01:20:09.104
COMMON CURRICULUM FOR NURSING

01:20:09.171 --> 01:20:11.206
EDUCATION. A COMMON CORE

01:20:11.273 --> 01:20:13.675
CURRICULUM ONE THAT LITTLE THAT

01:20:13.742 --> 01:20:14.843
IF SCHOOLS ADOPTED WOULD

01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:16.611
RESTRICT THIS SOME OF THE

01:20:16.678 --> 01:20:18.580
OVERSIGHT THAT THE BOARD-

01:20:18.647 --> 01:20:20.315
EXERCISES WITH RESPECT TO THE

01:20:20.382 --> 01:20:21.883
NURSING PROGRAMS. ENTER THE

01:20:21.950 --> 01:20:23.552
EXPRESS THE EXTENT THAT YOU NEED

01:20:23.618 --> 01:20:25.253
TO INSPECT AND APPROVE WHICH IS

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:27.622
I GUESS A LANGUAGE THAT WE ALL

01:20:27.689 --> 01:20:28.490
USE HERE. YOU WOULD ONLY NEED TO

01:20:28.557 --> 01:20:30.192
INSPECT AND APPROVE ONE TO MAKE

01:20:30.258 --> 01:20:32.761
SURE THAT THERE'S THE CORE

01:20:32.827 --> 01:20:34.262
CURRICULUM IN PLACE. AND TO THAT

01:20:34.329 --> 01:20:35.730
YOU WOULD INSPECTED APPROVED AND

01:20:35.797 --> 01:20:38.266
DETAIL ANY ADD ONS TO THE CORE

01:20:38.333 --> 01:20:43.939
CURRICULUM. IS THERE A REASON.

01:20:44.005 --> 01:20:46.675
CALIFORNIA DID PUT OUT A COMMENT

01:20:46.741 --> 01:20:49.511
CURRICULUM BACK AT THE TWO

01:20:49.578 --> 01:20:51.112
THOUSAND NINE WE DO HAVE SOME OF

01:20:51.179 --> 01:20:52.480
OUR STUDENTS SCHOOLS THAT ARE

01:20:52.547 --> 01:20:54.316
STILL UTILIZING THAT CURRICULUM-

01:20:54.382 --> 01:20:56.284
HOWEVER WE IT WAS FOUND TO NOT

01:20:56.351 --> 01:20:58.220
BE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL. THE

01:20:58.286 --> 01:20:59.554
BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSE

01:20:59.621 --> 01:21:02.224
NURSING DOES NOT HAVE CONTROL

01:21:02.290 --> 01:21:04.459
OVER CURRICULUM WHEN IT COMES

01:21:04.526 --> 01:21:06.294
2 DEGREES GRANTING WE ONLY HAVE

01:21:06.361 --> 01:21:08.196
A LICENSING REQUIREMENTS SO I

01:21:08.263 --> 01:21:09.397
THINK THAT MIGHT BE A

01:21:09.464 --> 01:21:11.266
MISUNDERSTANDING AS WELL. WE

01:21:11.333 --> 01:21:13.335
ONLY APPROVE THE CONTENT THAT IS

01:21:13.401 --> 01:21:15.670
REQUIRED FOR LICENSING ALL OTHER

01:21:15.737 --> 01:21:17.172
CONTENT IS SPECIFIC TO THAT

01:21:17.239 --> 01:21:18.740
SCHOOL AND SPECIFIC TO PREDICT

01:21:18.807 --> 01:21:21.042
GREASE. CALIFORNIA BEING A

01:21:21.109 --> 01:21:23.678
LEADER ALLOWS FOR MULTIPLE

01:21:23.745 --> 01:21:26.581
DIRECTIONS INTO THE PROFESSION

01:21:26.648 --> 01:21:28.550
WE HAVE AN ENTRY LEVEL MASTER'S

01:21:28.617 --> 01:21:30.151
WE HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE WE

01:21:30.218 --> 01:21:31.686
HAVE AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE WE HAVE

01:21:31.753 --> 01:21:33.555
THE THIRTY UNITS LV ENDS ARE AN

01:21:33.622 --> 01:21:35.991
OPTION. SO WITH THAT THERE'S NO

01:21:36.057 --> 01:21:37.325
DEGREE REQUIREMENT WITHIN

01:21:37.392 --> 01:21:39.060
CALIFORNIA WE ONLY HAVE

01:21:39.127 --> 01:21:40.395
LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS

01:21:40.462 --> 01:21:42.364
ADDITIONALLY THAT AFFECTS THE

01:21:42.430 --> 01:21:44.399
RECIPROCITY IN THE INTEREST OF

01:21:44.466 --> 01:21:46.067
OTHER NURSES FROM OUT OF STATE

01:21:46.134 --> 01:21:47.769
COMING INTO CALIFORNIA. IF WE

01:21:47.836 --> 01:21:50.572
HAD AN IRONCLAD YES THAT SAID

01:21:50.639 --> 01:21:52.974
THIS CURRICULUM MUST BE THIS

01:21:53.041 --> 01:21:54.509
THEN WE WOULD DECREASE THE

01:21:54.576 --> 01:21:56.645
AMOUNT OF NURSES THAT WOULD MEET

01:21:56.711 --> 01:21:57.979
THAT REQUIREMENT. FROM OUT OF

01:21:58.046 --> 01:21:59.581
STATE COMING INTO CALIFORNIA

01:21:59.648 --> 01:22:00.749
THAT'S ANOTHER THAT'S ANOTHER

01:22:00.815 --> 01:22:02.450
SUBJECT THAT I HAVE A QUESTION

01:22:02.517 --> 01:22:04.152
ON WHICH IS WHY YOU EVEN IF YOU

01:22:04.219 --> 01:22:06.788
HAVE A TEN YEAR NURSE. COMING IN

01:22:06.855 --> 01:22:07.489
FROM THE STATE OF GEORGIA WHY

01:22:07.555 --> 01:22:09.491
YOU DO A COMPLETE PRE LICENSURE

01:22:09.557 --> 01:22:11.159
REVIEW OF THE EDUCATIONAL

01:22:11.226 --> 01:22:12.794
BACKGROUND OF THE TEN YEAR NURSE

01:22:12.861 --> 01:22:18.566
BUT LET. ME FOCUS ON THE

01:22:18.633 --> 01:22:19.801
QUESTION AT HAND. YOU APPROVED

01:22:19.868 --> 01:22:20.435
FOR. YOU APPROVE NURSING. BUT

01:22:20.502 --> 01:22:22.237
YOU DON'T. YOU DON'T PUT OUT AND

01:22:22.304 --> 01:22:23.705
REQUIRE A CORE NURSING

01:22:23.772 --> 01:22:26.374
CURRICULA. WHICH MAKES NO SENSE

01:22:26.441 --> 01:22:28.910
TO ME AND IT CREATES A PROBLEM.

01:22:28.977 --> 01:22:31.913
FRANKLY IN THE PIPELINE BETWEEN

01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:33.748
THE ADN PROGRAMS AND A

01:22:33.815 --> 01:22:34.749
BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN NURSING

01:22:34.816 --> 01:22:37.152
PROGRAMS WHERE THE CURRICULA DO

01:22:37.218 --> 01:22:39.220
NOT ALIGN. AND IT WOULD SEEM TO

01:22:39.287 --> 01:22:40.689
ME THAT THE BOARD OF REGISTERED

01:22:40.755 --> 01:22:42.424
NURSING HAS THE TIME TO SPEND ON

01:22:42.490 --> 01:22:44.192
SOME OF THESE ACTIVITIES ONE OF

01:22:44.259 --> 01:22:45.460
THE THINGS THAT SHOULD MOVE TO

01:22:45.527 --> 01:22:47.896
THE TOP OF THE LIST. IS TO TRY

01:22:47.962 --> 01:22:49.431
TO ARRIVE AT A CORE CURRICULUM

01:22:49.497 --> 01:22:50.465
WHICH YOU CERTAINLY HAVE THE

01:22:50.532 --> 01:22:52.167
AUTHORITY TO DICTATE EITHER

01:22:52.233 --> 01:22:54.569
IT'S- EITHER. IN YOUR CHARTER IS

01:22:54.636 --> 01:22:56.604
A BOARD OR THROUGH THE

01:22:56.671 --> 01:22:59.174
CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE.

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:01.176
AND SO MY QUESTION IS WHY NOT.

01:23:01.242 --> 01:23:04.312
YEAH AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE IT IN

01:23:04.379 --> 01:23:05.847
OUR PROFESSIONS CODE WHERE WE

01:23:05.914 --> 01:23:07.982
WORK WITH OUR SCHOOLS AND MAKE

01:23:08.049 --> 01:23:11.186
IT BACK ONLINE WHAT WE FOUND WAS

01:23:11.252 --> 01:23:13.188
A LOT OF OUR SCHOOLS HAVE AN

01:23:13.254 --> 01:23:17.659
UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY ARE-

01:23:17.726 --> 01:23:19.194
THAT THEY HAVE THE BEST WAY

01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:21.830
FORWARD AND SO THEY HAVE THEIR

01:23:21.896 --> 01:23:24.165
INDIVIDUAL CURRICULA AND

01:23:24.232 --> 01:23:26.234
SOMETIMES WITH THE CSU SYSTEM

01:23:26.301 --> 01:23:28.269
THEY ONLY ACCEPT SIXTY UNIT

01:23:28.336 --> 01:23:29.904
TRANSFER WE HAD SOME NURSING

01:23:29.971 --> 01:23:32.207
PROGRAMS THAT WERE WELL OVER

01:23:32.273 --> 01:23:33.341
EIGHTY SO THEY'VE HAD TO

01:23:33.408 --> 01:23:35.076
DECREASE THAT YOU ALSO GET INTO

01:23:35.143 --> 01:23:39.414
COMPETITION WITH YOUR SCIENCE-

01:23:39.481 --> 01:23:40.949
INSTRUCTORS AT THE COLLEGE WHERE

01:23:41.015 --> 01:23:43.385
THEY BELIEVE. WE ONLY HAVE A

01:23:43.451 --> 01:23:44.619
REQUIREMENT FOR AT LEAST SIXTEEN

01:23:44.686 --> 01:23:47.188
UNITS OF SCIENCES AND THEY SAY-

01:23:47.255 --> 01:23:49.124
OR NINETEEN SORRY AND THEY SAY

01:23:49.190 --> 01:23:51.092
NO I NEED TWENTY FOUR UNITS ARE

01:23:51.159 --> 01:23:52.894
NOT GOING TO DROP MY REQUIREMENT

01:23:52.961 --> 01:23:55.263
OF MICROBIOLOGY SO THERE'S A LOT

01:23:55.330 --> 01:23:57.265
OF ISSUES THAT HAPPEN. IN THE

01:23:57.332 --> 01:23:59.067
DIVERSE ACADEMIC SETTING WITHIN

01:23:59.134 --> 01:24:01.870
CALIFORNIA WE HAVE MINIMUM

01:24:01.936 --> 01:24:03.705
STANDARDS WE DON'T HAVE MAXIMUM

01:24:03.772 --> 01:24:05.707
STANDARDS I WOULD THINK THAT IF

01:24:05.774 --> 01:24:07.609
WE PULL CORD MAXIMUM OR MINIMUM

01:24:07.675 --> 01:24:11.613
OR JUST A BLANK STANDARD- I

01:24:11.679 --> 01:24:13.281
THINK THAT WOULD. CHANGE THE WAY

01:24:13.348 --> 01:24:15.049
THAT NURSING EDUCATION YES

01:24:15.116 --> 01:24:16.217
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT OUR

01:24:16.284 --> 01:24:18.119
BOARD IS LOOKED AT YET I'D BE

01:24:18.186 --> 01:24:19.287
HAPPY TO BRING THAT IN FRONT OF

01:24:19.354 --> 01:24:21.656
THEM TO HAVE THEM CONSIDER THAT-

01:24:21.723 --> 01:24:24.159
BUT- ARE ARE I THINK WE HEAR A

01:24:24.225 --> 01:24:26.261
LOT OF FLASHBACK FROM RDG

01:24:26.327 --> 01:24:27.328
DIRECTORS BECAUSE THEY TRULY DO

01:24:27.395 --> 01:24:28.530
BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE THE

01:24:28.596 --> 01:24:30.298
CURRICULUM THAT FITS THEIR

01:24:30.365 --> 01:24:31.933
DEMOGRAPHIC IN THEIR COMMUNITY-

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.068
AND SO WE'VE- ONLY EVER SAID IF

01:24:34.135 --> 01:24:36.471
WE ARE IN. A MINIMUM LICENSE

01:24:36.538 --> 01:24:39.441
REQUIREMENTS- AS IT PERTAINS TO

01:24:39.507 --> 01:24:41.709
CURRICULUM AND NOT A SET

01:24:41.776 --> 01:24:44.379
STANDARD- BUT I CAN SEE THAT THE

01:24:44.446 --> 01:24:45.680
STATE STANDARD COULD HAVE SOME

01:24:45.747 --> 01:24:48.082
BENEFITS IT MAY ALSO HAVE SOME-

01:24:48.149 --> 01:24:50.151
COLLINS AND WE WOULD HAVE TO

01:24:50.218 --> 01:24:52.153
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND REVIEW

01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:54.189
ALL OF THAT. THE GREAT THING IS

01:24:54.255 --> 01:24:55.323
WE DO HAVE THE NURSING EDUCATION

01:24:55.390 --> 01:24:56.324
WORKFORCE- ADVISORY COMMITTEE

01:24:56.391 --> 01:24:59.194
NEED BACK AND- WE REALIGN THEM

01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:00.895
BACK IN NOVEMBER WE WERE BORED

01:25:00.962 --> 01:25:02.497
AND THEY WILL BE MEETING COME

01:25:02.564 --> 01:25:04.599
AGAIN IN APRIL AND THAT'S

01:25:04.666 --> 01:25:06.334
EXACTLY THE STUFF THAT THEY'RE

01:25:06.401 --> 01:25:08.269
TASKED TO LOOK AT. SO I WOULD BE

01:25:08.336 --> 01:25:10.038
HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR

01:25:10.104 --> 01:25:11.639
RECOMMENDATION- CENTER ROCK AND

01:25:11.706 --> 01:25:13.274
BRING IT FORWARD TO THEM AND SEE

01:25:13.341 --> 01:25:14.609
WHAT THEY CAN COME UP WITH I

01:25:14.676 --> 01:25:16.211
COULD SEE THAT THESE ARE SOME OF

01:25:16.277 --> 01:25:18.012
THE COMPLAINTS THAT WE RECEIVED

01:25:18.079 --> 01:25:20.615
I HEAR YOU WANT THEM AND I THINK

01:25:20.682 --> 01:25:21.249
THAT'S ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT

01:25:21.316 --> 01:25:22.951
WE CAN LOOK AT. WHAT HAPPENED IN

01:25:23.017 --> 01:25:24.185
THE PAST BECAUSE WE'VE ONLY SET

01:25:24.252 --> 01:25:25.954
MINIMUM STANDARDS YOU AND YOUR

01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:27.755
YOUR BOARD TEAM TELL ME THAT

01:25:27.822 --> 01:25:29.524
SOMEONE WHO GRADUATES FROM A TWO

01:25:29.591 --> 01:25:31.192
OR THREE YEAR PROGRAM WHETHER

01:25:31.259 --> 01:25:32.327
IT'S A COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR SOME

01:25:32.393 --> 01:25:34.262
OTHER PROGRAM OF THE- THAT

01:25:34.329 --> 01:25:36.598
QUALIFIES FOR THE EXAM AND FOR

01:25:36.664 --> 01:25:39.133
THE REGISTERED NURSING. LICENSE

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:40.468
CAN TAKE THAT EDUCATIONAL

01:25:40.535 --> 01:25:43.505
BACKGROUND AND MOVE IT ENTIRELY

01:25:43.571 --> 01:25:44.239
TO A CALIFORNIA STATE

01:25:44.305 --> 01:25:46.474
UNIVERSITY. SCHOOL OF NURSING OR

01:25:46.541 --> 01:25:47.775
SOME OTHER SCHOOL OF NURSING

01:25:47.842 --> 01:25:49.110
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I CALL THE

01:25:49.177 --> 01:25:51.246
CORE CURRICULUM. AN INMATE ALL

01:25:51.312 --> 01:25:53.381
OF ALL THE BASIC REBEL THE BASIC

01:25:53.448 --> 01:25:54.349
NURSING REQUIREMENTS WITHOUT

01:25:54.415 --> 01:25:56.217
HAVING TO RETAKE ANY CLINICAL

01:25:56.284 --> 01:25:58.186
NURSING COURSES AND INSTEAD

01:25:58.253 --> 01:25:59.687
CONCENTRATE ON THE LIBERAL ARTS

01:25:59.754 --> 01:26:01.289
COURSES AND- THE MANAGEMENT

01:26:01.356 --> 01:26:02.657
COURSES THAT MAKE THE DIFFERENCE

01:26:02.724 --> 01:26:04.158
BETWEEN THE ATM AND THE B. S.

01:26:04.225 --> 01:26:05.927
AND- THEN I'M SATISFIED BUT I

01:26:05.994 --> 01:26:07.562
SUSPECT. THE ANSWER TO MY

01:26:07.629 --> 01:26:13.701
QUESTION IS THAT DOESN'T. EXIST

01:26:13.768 --> 01:26:14.502
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:26:14.569 --> 01:26:16.437
TODAY. IT SAY. EXITING DOES THAT

01:26:16.504 --> 01:26:18.806
WELL I KNOW I WAS. WAS OF THAT

01:26:18.873 --> 01:26:20.508
PROBE IS YOU KNOW. STATE YEAH.

01:26:20.575 --> 01:26:22.343
IT THE FIRST. JUST TAKES MONTHS

01:26:22.410 --> 01:26:25.446
LATER BUT A REGIONAL. CURRICULUM

01:26:25.513 --> 01:26:27.582
BROKE GROUP THAT IS LOOKING AT

01:26:27.649 --> 01:26:28.783
THAT THEY'RE MAKING

01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:30.485
RECOMMENDATIONS ON IT IT IS MADE

01:26:30.552 --> 01:26:32.153
UP OF OUR DEANS AND DIRECTORS

01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:33.388
AND THEY WILL BE PUTTING THAT

01:26:33.454 --> 01:26:35.390
OUT AND THAT WOULD BE PERFECT IF

01:26:35.456 --> 01:26:36.591
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN.

01:26:36.658 --> 01:26:38.793
GATHER INCLUDING THE EVIDENCE

01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:40.395
AND SUBMIT APPROVAL I GUESS MY

01:26:40.461 --> 01:26:42.363
QUESTION IS WHY DOES THAT TAKE A

01:26:42.430 --> 01:26:43.932
CALIFORNIA STATE SENATOR SITTING

01:26:43.998 --> 01:26:44.933
IN HIS DISTRICT OFFICE

01:26:44.999 --> 01:26:47.135
CONVENING. LOCAL NURSING PROGRAM

01:26:47.201 --> 01:26:48.903
DIRECTORS DEANS AND COLLEGE

01:26:48.970 --> 01:26:51.005
PRESIDENTS AND PROVOSTS. TO DO

01:26:51.072 --> 01:26:52.640
THAT IS THAT NOT A FUNCTION OF

01:26:52.707 --> 01:26:54.542
THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING.

01:26:54.609 --> 01:26:57.045
BECAUSE BECAUSE IF YOU DID IT IT

01:26:57.111 --> 01:26:58.246
WOULD BE TRUE THROUGHOUT THE

01:26:58.313 --> 01:27:00.181
STATE AND WE WOULD NEED AND

01:27:00.248 --> 01:27:03.685
DEPEND ON REGIONAL.

01:27:03.751 --> 01:27:04.686
PARTICIPATION TO MAKE THAT

01:27:04.752 --> 01:27:06.654
HAPPEN RIGHT- THAT'S NOT. THAT

01:27:06.721 --> 01:27:08.089
THE BOARD HAS GONE BEFORE

01:27:08.156 --> 01:27:09.557
BECAUSE WE REALLY DO LIKE TO

01:27:09.624 --> 01:27:11.259
LEVERAGE THE EXPERTISE OF OUR

01:27:11.326 --> 01:27:13.595
DEANS AND DIRECTORS WHO KNOWS

01:27:13.661 --> 01:27:15.330
WHAT KIND OF FACULTY THEY HAVE

01:27:15.396 --> 01:27:16.898
NO THE DEMOGRAPHIC THAT THEY

01:27:16.965 --> 01:27:18.800
SERVE. IN REALLY THE NEEDS OF

01:27:18.866 --> 01:27:20.668
THAT COMMUNITY AND BASED ON

01:27:20.735 --> 01:27:22.770
THEIR INPUT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT

01:27:22.837 --> 01:27:24.405
CALIFORNIA'S VAST WHICH YOU HAVE

01:27:24.472 --> 01:27:26.007
IN IMPERIAL VALLEY DOWN HERE

01:27:26.074 --> 01:27:28.376
NEXT TO THE BORDER. IS VASTLY

01:27:28.443 --> 01:27:29.644
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU HAVE ND

01:27:29.711 --> 01:27:32.513
WHY RICA OR BUY SELL YEAH OR

01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:35.416
EVEN LA AND SO YOU WANT TO HAVE

01:27:35.483 --> 01:27:37.552
THOSE SCHOOLS TO SERVE THEIR

01:27:37.619 --> 01:27:39.520
SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES. AND OUR

01:27:39.587 --> 01:27:41.422
DEANS AND DIRECTORS HAVE THAT

01:27:41.489 --> 01:27:43.291
INNATE INFORMATION THAT THEY CAN

01:27:43.358 --> 01:27:45.460
LEVERAGE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE

01:27:45.526 --> 01:27:47.362
THAT INPUT IT'S GREAT TO GET

01:27:47.428 --> 01:27:49.030
THAT INPUT. I THINK THAT'S

01:27:49.097 --> 01:27:51.065
SOMETHING THAT OUR NEW ACTOR

01:27:51.132 --> 01:27:53.034
THAT NURSING EDUCATION WORKFORCE

01:27:53.101 --> 01:27:54.969
ADVISORY COMMITTEE CAN LOOK AT

01:27:55.036 --> 01:27:56.371
AND WE CAN PUT SOMETHING FORWARD

01:27:56.437 --> 01:27:58.539
THAT'S EVIDENCE BASE AS YOU KNOW

01:27:58.606 --> 01:27:59.674
IN ORDER TO GET ANYTHING

01:27:59.741 --> 01:28:01.309
DEREGULATION IN ANYTHING IN THE

01:28:01.376 --> 01:28:03.144
STATUTE EVERYTHING HAS TO BE

01:28:03.211 --> 01:28:05.446
EVIDENCE BASED. AND SO WHEN WE

01:28:05.513 --> 01:28:06.981
DO OUR REGULATORY CHANGE WHICH

01:28:07.048 --> 01:28:09.217
WE DIDN'T VOTE- AS A WARD IN

01:28:09.283 --> 01:28:11.486
NOVEMBER TO UPDATE SIXTEEN CC

01:28:11.552 --> 01:28:13.187
ARE FOURTEEN TWENTY SIX WHICH IS

01:28:13.254 --> 01:28:14.856
THE REQUIRED CURRICULUM. THAT

01:28:14.922 --> 01:28:16.891
WILL BE ABLE TO UPDATE THAT AND

01:28:16.958 --> 01:28:18.292
I THINK WE CAN GIVE YOU WHAT

01:28:18.359 --> 01:28:19.694
YOU'RE ASKING FOR SENATOR ROCKS

01:28:19.761 --> 01:28:21.796
I THINK IT IS TIME AND THAT'S

01:28:21.863 --> 01:28:23.297
WHAT OUR NATIONAL COUNCIL STATE

01:28:23.364 --> 01:28:24.932
BOARDS OF NURSING AGREEING TO.

01:28:24.999 --> 01:28:26.901
IT'S TIME TO DO A REVAMP OF

01:28:26.968 --> 01:28:28.503
NURSING EDUCATION AND SEE WHAT

01:28:28.569 --> 01:28:34.742
WE CAN ALIGN AND DO TOGETHER.

01:28:34.809 --> 01:28:36.544
WELL I'LL SAY THIS I MEAN IF. I

01:28:36.611 --> 01:28:37.245

01:28:39.547 --> 01:28:41.516
CADRE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:28:41.582 --> 01:28:42.617
IF THERE THAT MANY DIFFERENCES

01:28:42.684 --> 01:28:44.352
IN THE NURSING CURRICULA FROM

01:28:44.419 --> 01:28:46.421
THE TOP OF THE STATE TO THE

01:28:46.487 --> 01:28:47.789
BOTTOM OF THE STATE BUT FOR THE

01:28:47.855 --> 01:28:49.724
NATIONAL EXAM WHICH MUST BE THE

01:28:49.791 --> 01:28:51.426
LEVELING FORCE HERE TO MAKE

TRAINED AT HUMBOLDT OR SOME

01:28:54.362 --> 01:28:56.097
OTHER OR COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN

01:28:56.164 --> 01:28:58.066
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CAN MIGRATE

01:28:58.132 --> 01:28:59.600
TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIAN PERFORM

01:28:59.667 --> 01:29:01.869
EFFECTIVELY IN THE WORKPLACE BUT

01:29:01.936 --> 01:29:02.670
THANK YOU FOR THOSE RESPONSES I

01:29:02.737 --> 01:29:04.739
JUST HAVE. A COUPLE OTHER

01:29:04.806 --> 01:29:06.174
QUESTIONS AND I WANT TO TALK A

01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:07.375
LITTLE BIT ABOUT WORK FORCE

01:29:07.442 --> 01:29:09.310
MANAGEMENT SCHOOL APPROVALS THIS

01:29:09.377 --> 01:29:11.379
IS AN ISSUE FOR ME AND I KNOW

01:29:11.446 --> 01:29:12.947
THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING

01:29:13.014 --> 01:29:14.015
UTILIZES ECONOMICS AND WORK

01:29:14.082 --> 01:29:17.151
FORCE OF. A DATA IN ITS DECISION

01:29:17.218 --> 01:29:19.153
MAKING PROCESS BUT I DON'T KNOW

01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:21.322
TO WHAT EXTENT SO. I GUESS THE

01:29:21.389 --> 01:29:22.890
FIRST QUESTION IS WHAT FACTORS

01:29:22.957 --> 01:29:24.826
ARE UTILIZED TO DETERMINE

01:29:24.892 --> 01:29:26.461
WHETHER AN EXISTING PROGRAM.

01:29:26.527 --> 01:29:27.962

01:29:28.029 --> 01:29:31.999

DIRECTOR'S HAND BUT WITHIN THAT

01:29:37.472 --> 01:29:39.040
DIRECTORS HELM BUT IT ALLOWS THE

01:29:39.107 --> 01:29:40.641
PROCESS AND WHAT THEY CAN DO TO

01:29:40.708 --> 01:29:43.044
SEE CONGRESS OF STANHOPE CHANGE.

INCORPORATE ENROLLMENT INCREASES

01:36:03.224 --> 01:36:04.458
ASK A PRELIMINARY QUESTION MY R.

01:36:04.525 --> 01:36:06.427
BACKGROUND PAPER SAYS THAT WE

01:36:06.494 --> 01:36:08.028
HAVE FORTIN 580-001-0060 FIVE

01:36:08.095 --> 01:36:09.930
ACTIVELY LICENSED REGISTERED

NURSES IN THE STATE OF

01:36:11.065 --> 01:36:11.966
CALIFORNIA. I ASSUME THAT'S

01:36:12.032 --> 01:36:15.870
CORRECT SO DOES THE BOARD NO OR

01:36:15.936 --> 01:36:18.472
DOES YOUR STUDY REFLECT HOW MANY

01:36:18.539 --> 01:36:20.808
OF THOSE FOUR HUNDRED AND

01:36:20.875 --> 01:36:22.209
580-001-0060 FIVE ACTIVELY

01:36:22.276 --> 01:36:24.578
LICENSED NURSES ARE STILL IN

01:36:24.645 --> 01:36:27.214

OF NURSING OR HOW MANY HAVE.

01:36:29.049 --> 01:36:32.019
RETIRED OR DECIDED TO STAY HOME

01:36:32.086 --> 01:36:33.854
OR HAVE FOUND JOBS IN OTHER

01:36:33.921 --> 01:36:36.390
FIELDS OUTSIDE OF THE FIELD OF

01:36:36.457 --> 01:36:38.726
NURSING YET HAVE MAINTAINED AN

01:36:38.792 --> 01:36:41.829
ACTIVE LICENSE. SO THE GREAT

01:36:41.896 --> 01:36:43.364
THING IS WE WON THEM ALL OF THAT

01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:45.232
DATA REALLY SOON THAT

01:36:45.299 --> 01:36:47.735
LEGISLATORS PASSED A BILL LAST

01:36:47.801 --> 01:36:49.303
YEAR THAT GAVE THAT INFORMATION

01:36:49.370 --> 01:36:51.372
OVER THROUGH DC AIRPORTS ACROSS

01:36:51.438 --> 01:36:53.240
TO H. HIGH. AND SO H. KAISE

01:36:53.307 --> 01:36:55.910
DEVELOPING THAT ANY NURSE ANY

01:36:55.976 --> 01:36:57.778
HEALING ART TOWARD ANY RENEWAL

01:36:57.845 --> 01:36:59.880
OF THE LICENSE TO COLLECT THAT

01:36:59.947 --> 01:37:01.348
DATA TO FIND OUT ARE YOU

01:37:01.415 --> 01:37:03.751
GAINFULLY EMPLOYED ARE YOU

01:37:03.817 --> 01:37:06.020
DECIDING TO. RETIRE AND SO THAT

01:37:06.086 --> 01:37:07.855
WAS JUST PASSED IN JANUARY OF

01:37:07.922 --> 01:37:10.191
THIS LAST YEAR AND GIVEN TO H.

01:37:10.257 --> 01:37:12.359
FIVE AND H. FIVE WILL BE GIVING

01:37:12.426 --> 01:37:13.427

THE DCA WHITE BOARDS AND GIRLS

01:37:14.528 --> 01:37:16.830
ARE AFFECTED BY THAT WELL THEN I

01:37:16.897 --> 01:37:18.232
ASSUME THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO

01:37:18.299 --> 01:37:19.200
BE USING FORECASTED SUPPLY OF

01:37:19.266 --> 01:37:21.802

IS THEY BASE THAT ON THE REPORTS

ECONOMIC FACTORS VACANCY

01:38:55.129 --> 01:38:57.131
ANALYSIS IN DETERMINING WHETHER

OTHER- THE OTHER OCCUPATION I

01:39:06.173 --> 01:39:08.409
MENTIONED. AND SO I GUESS I'M

01:39:08.475 --> 01:39:09.310
WONDERING WHAT'S UNIQUE ABOUT

01:39:09.376 --> 01:39:11.111
THE NURSING PROFESSION THAT

01:39:11.178 --> 01:39:13.380
CAUSES YOU TO WANT TO DO THAT AS

01:39:13.447 --> 01:39:15.215
A AS A FIELD YOU BEING THE

01:39:15.282 --> 01:39:20.621
BOARD. NUMBER ONE- CAN THE

01:39:20.688 --> 01:39:22.756
FOLLOW UP QUESTION IS WHY NOT

01:39:22.823 --> 01:39:24.758
WHAT ECONOMIC FACTORS IN THE

01:39:24.825 --> 01:39:27.828
MARKET PLACE DICTATE THE SIZE

01:39:27.895 --> 01:39:30.297
AND SUCCESS OF NURSING TRAINING

01:39:30.364 --> 01:39:33.167
PROGRAMS WHAT GIVES THE BORDER

01:39:33.233 --> 01:39:34.735
THE STATE. THE RIGHT THE

01:39:34.802 --> 01:39:36.837
ENTITLEMENT TO REACH DOWN AND

01:39:36.904 --> 01:39:39.473
TELL ENTITIES THAT WANT TO TRAIN

01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:42.142
NURSES THAT THEY CAN'T DO IT

01:39:42.209 --> 01:39:44.445
BECAUSE OUR STUDY INDICATES WE

01:39:44.511 --> 01:39:48.048
DON'T NEED ANY MORE NURSES. SO

01:39:48.115 --> 01:39:49.316
I'LL TRY TO CLARIFY THAT A

01:39:49.383 --> 01:39:52.353
LITTLE BIT- FOR YOU THERE WE

01:39:52.419 --> 01:39:54.755
DON'T SAY THAT BECAUSE THE WORK

01:39:54.822 --> 01:39:58.258
FORCE NEEDED IS NOT NEEDED IN LA

01:39:58.325 --> 01:40:00.060
THAT WE MORE GROUP WHEN THEY

01:40:00.127 --> 01:40:01.729
BRING INFORMATION TO US OUR

01:40:01.795 --> 01:40:03.330
BOARD LOOKS AT THAT INFORMATION

01:40:03.397 --> 01:40:05.432
AND IN FACT WE'VE APPROVED

01:40:05.499 --> 01:40:06.767
SEVERAL SCHOOLS JUST THIS LAST

01:40:06.834 --> 01:40:09.636
YEAR. FOR LA IN ORANGE COUNTY I

01:40:09.703 --> 01:40:11.305
HAVE THREE SCHOOLS RIGHT OFF THE

01:40:11.372 --> 01:40:13.374
TOP OF MY HEAD THAT I CAN THINK

01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:15.376
OF THAT A LADY IN A INCREASE IN

01:40:15.442 --> 01:40:16.610
ORANGE COUNTY INCREASED ACTUALLY

01:40:16.677 --> 01:40:19.012
BY SCHOOLS IN LA. AND SO WITH

01:40:19.079 --> 01:40:22.082
THAT YOU IT'S NOT BASED SOLELY

01:40:22.149 --> 01:40:24.618
ON WORKFORCE NEED- BUT THERE ARE

01:40:24.685 --> 01:40:26.487
STATISTICS OUT THERE THAT SHOW

01:40:26.553 --> 01:40:27.521
THAT A PERSON THAT GOES TO

01:40:27.588 --> 01:40:29.423
SCHOOL REALLY WANTS TO BE

01:40:29.490 --> 01:40:30.424
EMPLOYED WITHIN FIFTY MILES OF

01:40:30.491 --> 01:40:31.225
WHERE THEY WENT TO SCHOOL AND

01:40:31.291 --> 01:40:32.393
STAYED WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITY

01:40:32.459 --> 01:40:34.428
AND SERVE THAT COMMUNITY. WHAT

01:40:34.495 --> 01:40:35.662
HAPPENED WHEN THE RECESSION HIT

01:40:35.729 --> 01:40:38.031
IN TWO THOUSAND NINE IS NURSING

01:40:38.098 --> 01:40:39.900
STUDENTS WERE GRADUATING AND

01:40:39.967 --> 01:40:40.701
THEY WERE HAVING TO MOVE TO

01:40:40.768 --> 01:40:42.169
ALASKA TO GET JOBS OUT OF

01:40:42.236 --> 01:40:43.103
CALIFORNIA NEVER MOVED TO

01:40:43.170 --> 01:40:45.272
KENTUCKY TO GET JUST. GIVE ME

01:40:45.339 --> 01:40:47.441
JOBS OUT OF CALIFORNIA WHAT YOU

01:40:47.508 --> 01:40:49.543
DON'T WANT TO SEE IS THAT YOU

01:40:49.610 --> 01:40:52.780
GOT NURSES GRADUATING SCHOOL

01:40:52.846 --> 01:40:54.581
PASSING IT COLLECTS AND THEY

01:40:54.648 --> 01:40:56.517
CANNOT GET EMPLOYEE SO THAT IS

01:40:56.583 --> 01:40:58.218
SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS ALWAYS

01:40:58.285 --> 01:41:00.154
KIND OF IN THE BACK BURNER THAT

01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:01.155
YOU WILL TAKE INTO

01:41:01.221 --> 01:41:02.923
CONSIDERATION. KNOWING THAT THE

01:41:02.990 --> 01:41:04.992
DATA SUPPORTS OF THE STATEMENT

01:41:05.058 --> 01:41:07.428
FIFTY MILES OF WHERE THEY GO TO

01:41:07.494 --> 01:41:08.695
SCHOOL BUT ADDITIONALLY YOU WANT

01:41:08.762 --> 01:41:10.197
TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS THE

01:41:10.264 --> 01:41:13.200
CLINICAL IMPACTION THAT'S TRULY

01:41:13.267 --> 01:41:14.735
THE NUMBER ONE INDICATOR AND

01:41:14.802 --> 01:41:20.874
ALSO LET ME DIRECT I DON'T. I

01:41:20.941 --> 01:41:21.708
DON'T. I DON'T. PLEASE I DON'T

01:41:21.775 --> 01:41:23.243
DISAGREE THAT CLINICAL PLAY. ARE

01:41:23.310 --> 01:41:24.445
FACTOR DIDN'T SAY THAT. LET'S

01:41:24.511 --> 01:41:26.947
MICHAEL. IS WHY DO YOU CONSIDER

01:41:27.014 --> 01:41:29.183
A WORK FORCE ANALYSIS. AND

01:41:29.249 --> 01:41:31.118
SUPPLY OF NURSES OR NOT IN

01:41:31.185 --> 01:41:33.287
MAKING THESE DECISIONS WHEN NO

01:41:33.353 --> 01:41:35.055
OTHER OCCUPATION APPEARS TO BE

01:41:35.122 --> 01:41:37.658
DOING THAT. AND FRANKLY IF WE

01:41:37.724 --> 01:41:38.859
APPLIED YOUR STANDARD TO THE

01:41:38.926 --> 01:41:40.160
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND THE

01:41:40.227 --> 01:41:42.396
CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY.

01:41:42.463 --> 01:41:43.831
THAT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING

01:41:43.897 --> 01:41:45.632
OUTCOME TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY

01:41:45.699 --> 01:41:47.668
CAN ONLY AND ROLL THOSE PEOPLE.

01:41:47.734 --> 01:41:49.169
WHO WERE WORKING OR TRAINING FOR

01:41:49.236 --> 01:41:52.506
JOBS WHERE JOBS EXISTED WITHIN

01:41:52.573 --> 01:41:53.674
FIFTY MILES OF THEIR PLACE OF

01:41:53.740 --> 01:41:55.108
RESIDENCE. SO THAT'S NOT A

01:41:55.175 --> 01:41:57.344
REQUIREMENT THAT'S THE EVIDENCE

01:41:57.411 --> 01:41:59.313
THAT SAYS WHY THIS IS SOMETHING

01:41:59.379 --> 01:42:02.082
WE SHOULD CONSIDER THERE'S NOT A

01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:03.717
ONE AND DONE ANSWER FOR THIS IT

01:42:03.784 --> 01:42:06.620
IS A MUCH MORE ROBUST. AND VERY

01:42:06.687 --> 01:42:09.189
DIFFICULT. TACTIC TO EVEN LOOK

01:42:09.256 --> 01:42:13.060
AT WHICH IS WHY I BELIEVE AB TEN

01:42:13.126 --> 01:42:15.195
FIFTEEN WAS ASKED FOR YOU GUYS

01:42:15.262 --> 01:42:16.063
THIS LAST YEAR THEY GAVE THE

01:42:16.129 --> 01:42:17.431
BOARD THE SPECIFIC DIRECTION IN

01:42:17.498 --> 01:42:20.534
BPC TWENTY. SEVENTEEN SO LOOK AT

01:42:20.601 --> 01:42:22.436
THIS TO FIND CLINICAL PLACEMENTS

01:42:22.503 --> 01:42:25.639
TO FIND. ANSWER FOR ALL OF THIS

01:42:25.706 --> 01:42:28.175
SO THAT WE CAN HAVE OUR SCHOOLS

01:42:28.242 --> 01:42:30.711
EXPAND AS NEEDED TO SERVE THE

01:42:30.777 --> 01:42:32.846
NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA. BUT WE ALSO

01:42:32.913 --> 01:42:34.281
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT JUST LIKE

01:42:34.348 --> 01:42:36.817
WE DO WITH- PRIVATE COLLEGES ARE

01:42:36.884 --> 01:42:38.051
LOOKED OUT WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING

01:42:38.118 --> 01:42:39.453
AT THEIR CREDIT EACH AND THEY'RE

01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:40.954
LOOKING AT THEIR FUNDING.

01:42:41.021 --> 01:42:41.722
COMMUNITY COLLEGE- LOOKED AT

01:42:41.788 --> 01:42:43.991
EXACTLY THE SAME WAY YOU CAN

01:42:44.057 --> 01:42:46.226
GRADUATE SCHOOL STUDENTS BUT ARE

01:42:46.293 --> 01:42:48.462
THOSE STUDENTS ABLE TO BE

01:42:48.529 --> 01:42:50.330
GAINFULLY EMPLOYED AFTERWARDS

01:42:50.397 --> 01:42:52.332
AND THAT'S THE KEY YOU DON'T

01:42:52.399 --> 01:42:54.101
WANT PEOPLE WALKING AROUND WITH

01:42:54.167 --> 01:42:56.370
THE STUDENT LOAN DEBT AND A

01:42:56.436 --> 01:42:57.538
DEGREE. I CAN'T GET A JOB SO YOU

01:42:57.604 --> 01:42:59.673
HAVE TO TAKE IN ALL OF THESE

01:42:59.740 --> 01:43:01.975
THINGS INTO CONSIDERATION TO SEE

01:43:02.042 --> 01:43:03.243
WHETHER OR NOT YOU WERE TRULY

01:43:03.310 --> 01:43:05.812
ABLE TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC. AND

01:43:05.879 --> 01:43:07.681
OUR STUDENTS ARE PUBLIC AS WELL

01:43:07.748 --> 01:43:10.183
AND SO YOU WANT THEM TO BE ABLE

01:43:10.250 --> 01:43:11.718
TO BE GAINFULLY EMPLOYED

01:43:11.785 --> 01:43:13.453
AFTERWARDS SO THAT IS ONLY A

01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:15.355
PARTIAL CONSIDERATION THERE ARE

01:43:15.422 --> 01:43:17.124
SO MANY OTHER THINGS THAT ARE

MAJOR VERSUS MINOR MEANS. YEAH

01:45:21.348 --> 01:45:22.516
WE HAVE THAT IT'S CALLED THE

DIRECTOR'S HANDBOOK. WE SHARED

01:45:24.317 --> 01:45:25.986
THAT AN UPDATE BACK ANNUALLY FOR

THEM IT IS BASED ON OUR

01:45:27.387 --> 01:45:29.523
REGULATIONS WE DO HAVE A CURRENT

01:45:29.589 --> 01:45:31.124
REGULATORY PACKAGE THAT IS THE

ACT AWAY ALL. THAT WE RECEIVE

01:45:32.793 --> 01:45:34.261
SOME PUBLIC COMMENT ON THAT WILL

BE ADDRESSING. AND THAT

01:45:35.562 --> 01:45:37.431
ADDRESSES THE TWO REGULATIONS

01:45:37.497 --> 01:45:39.166
THAT WE UPDATED THAT PROVIDED

01:45:39.232 --> 01:45:40.434
ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION ON

ALIGNMENT BALL THOSE LAWS. AND

01:46:17.671 --> 01:46:18.705
SO WE'RE UPDATING OUR

01:46:18.772 --> 01:46:20.607
REGULATIONS TO BE MORE CLEAR.

01:46:20.674 --> 01:46:22.476

HAVE TO BE A MAJOR CURRICULUM

01:46:44.498 --> 01:46:45.999
VISIONS AND THE MAJORITY OF TIME

01:46:46.066 --> 01:46:48.201
IT'S MINOR. AND SO THEY DO NOT

01:46:48.268 --> 01:46:49.336
HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING THAT'S

01:46:49.402 --> 01:46:51.471

IT'S A GREAT PROCESS THAT WE

01:47:01.281 --> 01:47:02.482
HAVE IN PLACE AND WE CAN

01:47:02.549 --> 01:47:03.750
DEFINITELY IF THERE'S ANY

01:47:03.817 --> 01:47:05.252
SPECIFIC PROGRAM DIRECTORS ARE

01:47:05.318 --> 01:47:07.254
HAVING SOME PROBLEMS WITH THIS.

01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:08.555
OR ANY SEES CAN REACH OUT TO

01:47:08.622 --> 01:47:09.556
THEM AND HAVE THOSE

01:47:09.623 --> 01:47:11.124

THOUGHTS ON ON LOWERING THAT

01:47:21.401 --> 01:47:22.435
MINIMUM- IF THAT'S SOMETHING

01:47:22.502 --> 01:47:24.905

BRIEFS- BUT I THINK I'M UNIQUELY

02:12:32.044 --> 02:12:33.178
QUALIFIED TO TALK ABOUT THE

02:12:33.245 --> 02:12:34.646
SUBJECT MATTER JUST A QUICK

02:12:34.713 --> 02:12:37.482

COVER. INFILTRATING HUMAN

02:12:53.699 --> 02:12:55.567
TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATION THAT

02:12:55.634 --> 02:12:57.436
RESULTED IN THE TAKE DOWN OF

02:12:57.502 --> 02:12:58.770
SEVERAL MONTHS SOLID COLORS THAT

02:12:58.837 --> 02:13:01.139
WERE ACTING ILLEGALLY. I'M ALSO

02:13:01.206 --> 02:13:02.974
UNIQUELY QUALIFIED TO TALK ABOUT

02:13:03.041 --> 02:13:04.343
THE SUBJECT MATTER BECAUSE AS A

02:13:04.409 --> 02:13:07.179
DEPUTY CHIEF I STOOD IN THE

02:13:07.245 --> 02:13:08.780
HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE CHAMBERS.

02:13:08.847 --> 02:13:11.583
ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO LEGISLATOR

02:13:11.650 --> 02:13:13.518
INSTITUTING THE C. A. M. P. C.

02:13:13.585 --> 02:13:14.986
AND I WAS REPRESENTING CAL

02:13:15.053 --> 02:13:17.356
CHIEFS AT THAT TIME. I AM HERE

02:13:17.422 --> 02:13:19.591
TO TELL YOU. I WAS WRONG. IN ALL

02:13:19.658 --> 02:13:22.694
OF YOU. RIGHT CERTAINLY YOUR

02:13:22.761 --> 02:13:24.329
PREDECESSORS WERE RIGHT ON THIS-

02:13:24.396 --> 02:13:27.265
IT WAS INGENIOUS- TO CREATE A

02:13:27.332 --> 02:13:29.234
NEW STRUCTURE THAT WAS MINIMAL

02:13:29.301 --> 02:13:31.370
YOU CAN FACE UNIQUE CHALLENGES

02:13:31.436 --> 02:13:32.437
FACING WITH THE MASSAGE

02:13:32.504 --> 02:13:34.272
INDUSTRY. THAT HAD LITERALLY

02:13:34.339 --> 02:13:42.180
BEEN BY CRIMINALS THAT CREATED.

02:13:42.247 --> 02:13:43.248
A PIPELINE FOR HUMAN

02:13:43.315 --> 02:13:44.316
TRAFFICKING. I GOT TO WITNESS

02:13:44.383 --> 02:13:46.084
HIS FIRST UP. IN A TELL YOU IT

02:13:46.151 --> 02:13:47.652
WAS SEEM LESS. THAN TRAGIC. BY

02:13:47.719 --> 02:13:50.789
CREATING THE C. A. ANTI CD- YOU

02:13:50.856 --> 02:13:52.257
ALL CREATED IN A NIBBLE LEAD

02:13:52.324 --> 02:13:54.459
ORGANIZATION THANK YOU GO TO THE

02:13:54.526 --> 02:13:56.161
VERY HEART OF THE PROBLEM IN A

02:13:56.228 --> 02:13:59.631
WAY THAT NO STATE BOARD NO CITY

02:13:59.698 --> 02:14:01.199
IN NO COUNTY COULD EVER DO. AND

02:14:01.266 --> 02:14:03.034
I SAY THE CREATION OF THE C. M.

02:14:03.101 --> 02:14:05.337
D. C. WAS INGENIOUS. BECAUSE HE

02:14:05.404 --> 02:14:07.172
CREATED A FLEXIBLE STRUCTURE

02:14:07.239 --> 02:14:09.374
THAT FINALLY FINALLY ALLOWED THE

02:14:09.441 --> 02:14:11.009
STATE TO ADDRESS THE CRIMINAL

02:14:11.076 --> 02:14:13.145
ELEMENT THAT HAD INFILTRATED.

02:14:13.211 --> 02:14:15.147
THE MASSAGE INDUSTRY IN IT

02:14:15.213 --> 02:14:17.149
ALLOWED US TO DO IT IN A

02:14:17.215 --> 02:14:18.550
COORDINATED AND COMPREHENSIVE

02:14:18.617 --> 02:14:21.753
WAY. THE PROCESS IN PLACE NOW-

02:14:21.820 --> 02:14:23.922
THE D. C. M. D. C. OUR HOUSE

02:14:23.989 --> 02:14:26.858
ALLOWS FOR DENIALS IN DISCIPLINE

02:14:26.925 --> 02:14:28.827
A BAD ACTORS IN A QUICK FASHION

02:14:28.894 --> 02:14:30.562
AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY KEY.

02:14:30.629 --> 02:14:32.731
BECAUSE WHITES ARE AT STAKE. IN

02:14:32.798 --> 02:14:34.466
FINANCIAL GAME FOR CRIMINALS IS

02:14:34.533 --> 02:14:36.134
JUST TOO GREAT WITHOUT THAT

02:14:36.201 --> 02:14:39.237
SWEPT IN DECISIVE ACTION. IN

02:14:39.304 --> 02:14:40.305
FACT I'M A MEMBER OF THE STATE

02:14:40.372 --> 02:14:44.042
BAR. AND- I HAVE LOOKED AT MANY

02:14:44.109 --> 02:14:46.278
OTHER- LICENSURE ASSOCIATIONS.

02:14:46.344 --> 02:14:48.713
AND WHAT TAKES THEM YEARS TO DO

02:14:48.780 --> 02:14:51.249
IN THE AREA OF DISCIPLINE YEARS

02:14:51.316 --> 02:14:54.052
WE CNT SEE USUALLY DOES AN

02:14:54.119 --> 02:14:57.756
AVERAGE OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY

02:14:57.823 --> 02:15:00.358
THREE DAYS. THIS ALSO US DCA MP

02:15:00.425 --> 02:15:02.594
C. TO GO OUT THE TRAFFICKING

02:15:02.661 --> 02:15:04.362
PIPELINE. THESE WERE THE SHAM

02:15:04.429 --> 02:15:07.265
SCHOOLS IN THE DIPLOMA MILLS

02:15:07.332 --> 02:15:09.835
WERE LOCATED. IT WAS INCREDIBLE

02:15:09.901 --> 02:15:12.604
THE AMOUNT OF- WORK IT TOOK TO

02:15:12.671 --> 02:15:14.606
ROUTE THOSE OUT AND- IT

02:15:14.673 --> 02:15:17.209
CERTAINLY. WAS WAS SOMETHING

02:15:17.275 --> 02:15:18.710
THAT WAS VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO

02:15:18.777 --> 02:15:20.178
STOPPING HUMAN TRAFFICKING

02:15:20.245 --> 02:15:23.448
PIPELINE. BUT THE PROCESS OF

02:15:23.515 --> 02:15:24.349
DEALING WITH THE SAME SCHOOLS

02:15:24.416 --> 02:15:26.751
AND THE ORGANIZATIONS COULD NOT

02:15:26.818 --> 02:15:28.954
BE REPLICATED BY CITIES COUNTIES

02:15:29.020 --> 02:15:30.922
OR STATE BOARDS. IN THERE IT

02:15:30.989 --> 02:15:33.358
REALLY HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST

02:15:33.425 --> 02:15:34.759
IMPACTFUL THINGS THAT WE'VE

02:15:34.826 --> 02:15:37.229
DONE- IN IN- IN OUR TEN YEAR TO

02:15:37.295 --> 02:15:40.432
ELIMINATE THAT PIPELINE OF HUMAN

02:15:40.499 --> 02:15:42.501
TRAFFICKING. SO AFTER COUCHES

02:15:42.567 --> 02:15:43.401
FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS

02:15:43.468 --> 02:15:44.769
UNION G. C. WHICH WE LOST

02:15:44.836 --> 02:15:46.571
TONIGHT AND I WAS EDUCATED THANK

02:15:46.638 --> 02:15:48.273
GOODNESS WE DID LOSE AT THAT

02:15:48.340 --> 02:15:50.075
TIME. THE LEAGUE OF CITIES PUT

02:15:50.141 --> 02:15:52.477
ME ON THE C. A. M. P. C. BOARD

02:15:52.544 --> 02:15:54.379
AS THEIR REPRESENTATIVE- I MEAN

02:15:54.446 --> 02:15:56.515
I WAS TRULY THERE TO WAGE A WAR

02:15:56.581 --> 02:15:58.717
AGAINST THE C. A. M. P. C.

02:15:58.783 --> 02:15:59.951
BECAUSE- CERTAINLY DIDN'T

02:16:00.018 --> 02:16:00.552
BELIEVE THAT I COULD DO WHAT

02:16:00.619 --> 02:16:03.822
REPORTED TO DO. AND AND I WAS

02:16:03.889 --> 02:16:06.057
WRONG AGAIN- I GOTTA TELL YOU

02:16:06.124 --> 02:16:08.760
THAT- I WAS SO PROUD TO FIND OUT

02:16:08.827 --> 02:16:11.062
THE DATE- REPRESENTED MY

02:16:11.129 --> 02:16:12.497
GREATEST DESIRE AND THAT WAS

02:16:12.564 --> 02:16:14.132
PUBLIC SAFETY AND WE WORK

02:16:14.199 --> 02:16:15.433
TOGETHER TO BRING ABOUT THE

02:16:15.500 --> 02:16:16.768
RULES AND REGULATIONS. THAT

02:16:16.835 --> 02:16:18.737
WOULD PROMOTE THIS PUBLIC SAFETY

02:16:18.803 --> 02:16:20.138
SO I QUICKLY REALIZED THAT THE

02:16:20.205 --> 02:16:22.941
CMT C. WAS EMBARKING DOWN THE

02:16:23.008 --> 02:16:25.277
PATH THAT CITIES AND LICENSING

02:16:25.343 --> 02:16:27.245
BOARDS IN COUNTIES COULD NEVER

02:16:27.312 --> 02:16:29.247
ACCOMPLISH. AND THAT WAS TO

02:16:29.314 --> 02:16:30.382
BRING ABOUT COORDINATION

02:16:30.448 --> 02:16:32.684
COLLABORATION ENFORCEMENT OF

02:16:32.751 --> 02:16:34.953
STATEWIDE RULES TO THE HEALING

02:16:35.020 --> 02:16:37.556
ART PROFESSION. AS I MENTIONED-

02:16:37.622 --> 02:16:39.658
THAT WAS A GREAT THING THAT THE

02:16:39.724 --> 02:16:41.660
LEGISLATOR DID AND NOW IT LOOKS

02:16:41.726 --> 02:16:43.728
LIKE WE ARE LOOKING FOR A

02:16:43.795 --> 02:16:45.263
SOLUTION IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM

02:16:45.330 --> 02:16:47.866
IN THERE IS NO PROBLEM. I CAN

02:16:47.933 --> 02:16:49.568
GUARANTEE YOU THIS IS THE BEST

02:16:49.634 --> 02:16:50.602
AFTER FORTY YEARS IN THIS

02:16:50.669 --> 02:16:52.304
BUSINESS THIS IS THE BEST

02:16:52.370 --> 02:16:57.275
POSSIBLE. SOLUTION AND YOU ARE

02:16:57.342 --> 02:16:59.110
CREATED- SO I TELL YOU THAT I.

02:16:59.177 --> 02:17:01.279
SO MY IN FAVOR OF THIS AND I'M

02:17:01.346 --> 02:17:02.881
PROUD OF WHAT THIS LEGISLATOR

02:17:02.948 --> 02:17:04.683
DID IN CREATING THE C. M. D. C.

02:17:04.749 --> 02:17:06.384
AND I'M PROUD TO BE ON THE

02:17:06.451 --> 02:17:08.253
DIVERSE SPORT. NOW REPRESENTING

02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:11.289
C. SACK- THIS BOARD IS PROVIDING

02:17:11.356 --> 02:17:13.291
DEGREE OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND

02:17:13.358 --> 02:17:14.826
BORDER THAT IS REALLY

02:17:14.893 --> 02:17:16.528
UNPARALLELED. THE C. M. D. C.

02:17:16.595 --> 02:17:17.963
BOARD MEANS ARE TRANSPARENT

02:17:18.029 --> 02:17:19.264
OPEN. WE HAVE A VIGOROUS

02:17:19.331 --> 02:17:20.865
DISCUSSIONS WE HAVE PERFORMANCE

02:17:20.932 --> 02:17:24.069
METRICS IN PLACE- WE ARE FOCUSED

02:17:24.135 --> 02:17:25.437
ON CUSTOMER SERVICE AND I THINK

02:17:25.503 --> 02:17:27.372
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY KEY BECAUSE

02:17:27.439 --> 02:17:29.441
OUR CUSTOMERS. ARE VERY VERY

02:17:29.507 --> 02:17:31.643
IMPORTANT. AND IN FACT WE HAVE

02:17:31.710 --> 02:17:34.012
CUSTOMER SERVICE AGENTS ON. LINE

02:17:34.079 --> 02:17:35.947
READY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. IN

02:17:36.014 --> 02:17:37.782
SECONDS THAT I KNOW OF NO OTHER

02:17:37.849 --> 02:17:39.718
AGENCY THAT DOES THAT. WE ARE

02:17:39.784 --> 02:17:41.186
SOLVENT WITH THAT AS MENTIONED

02:17:41.252 --> 02:17:43.355
BEFORE SIX MONTHS OF RESERVES IN

02:17:43.421 --> 02:17:45.323
A BALANCED BUDGET- IN IT I CAN

02:17:45.390 --> 02:17:47.092
TELL YOU WOULD BE VERY VERY

02:17:47.158 --> 02:17:48.693
DIFFICULT FOR ANY LICENSING

02:17:48.760 --> 02:17:50.862
BOARD. TO ACHIEVE THAT WITH OUR-

02:17:50.929 --> 02:17:52.330
INCREDIBLE BUT WITHOUT AN

02:17:52.397 --> 02:17:54.099
INCREDIBLE INCREASE IN

02:17:54.165 --> 02:17:56.001
INTERVIEWS. AND WE LISTEN AND

02:17:56.067 --> 02:17:57.202
CERTAINLY WE'RE NOT PERFECT BUT

02:17:57.268 --> 02:17:58.770
WE'RE WILLING TO LISTEN IN ORDER

02:17:58.837 --> 02:18:00.205
TO GET BETTER I THINK THAT'S THE

02:18:00.271 --> 02:18:03.341
KEY MARKET ANY. AGENCY SO RIGHT

02:18:03.408 --> 02:18:05.143
NOW EVERYONE IS ROWING IN THE

02:18:05.210 --> 02:18:10.081
SAME DIRECTION. WE ARE THERE. WE

02:18:10.148 --> 02:18:12.117
THERE USED TO BE TO SEE. AND

02:18:12.183 --> 02:18:13.485
DOUG- IN THE WORK. WE'RE GONNA

02:18:13.551 --> 02:18:14.786
IN GREAT CHAOS IN THE

02:18:14.853 --> 02:18:16.521
ENFORCEMENT WHICH I. WORKED ON

02:18:16.588 --> 02:18:18.790
FIRST HAND THERE IS NOW EXTREME

02:18:18.857 --> 02:18:21.359
COOPERATION AND COORDINATION AND

02:18:21.426 --> 02:18:23.094
COLLABORATION. AND THERE YOU

02:18:23.161 --> 02:18:24.663
WILL HAVE OTHER SPEAK AGAINST-

02:18:24.729 --> 02:18:26.665
THE C. M. D. C. I'M SURE. BUT I

02:18:26.731 --> 02:18:29.034
WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU TO LOOK AT

02:18:29.100 --> 02:18:30.068
THEIR MOTIVATION THAT IS KEY

02:18:30.135 --> 02:18:31.169
BECAUSE OUR MOTIVATION CAN'T BE

02:18:31.236 --> 02:18:32.771
ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY WHICH I

02:18:32.837 --> 02:18:34.139
THINK IS PARAMOUNT FOR THE

02:18:34.205 --> 02:18:38.209
CONSUMERS AND THE THERAPIST. WHO

02:18:38.276 --> 02:18:39.344
WANT TO OPERATE IN GENERAL

02:18:39.411 --> 02:18:40.412
BUSINESS. IN MY OPINION CHANGED

02:18:40.478 --> 02:18:42.213
THE MODEL THAT YOU ALL CREATED

02:18:42.280 --> 02:18:44.082
WOULD SEND US BACK TWENTY PLUS

02:18:44.149 --> 02:18:45.717
YEARS TOOK PLACE WE NEVER WANT

02:18:45.784 --> 02:18:47.185
TO GO BACK TO. AND THOUGH- I'VE

BE HEARD. ROSS THIS IS VERY

02:32:34.578 --> 02:32:36.113
SIMILAR TO WHAT THE CITIES AND

02:32:36.180 --> 02:32:38.516

02:33:08.245 --> 02:33:09.713

INDIVIDUALS WHERE ENGLISH IS

CLEARLY IDENTIFIES DATES AND

02:33:22.660 --> 02:33:24.428
DEADLINES. SO IT NOTIFIES

02:33:24.495 --> 02:33:26.196
INDIVIDUALS WHEN THEY MIGHT MAY

02:33:26.263 --> 02:33:27.498

THERE'S ALSO A DEDICATED EMAIL

02:33:45.015 --> 02:33:46.750
ADDRESS IN THE LETTERS AND THAT

02:33:46.817 --> 02:33:48.118
GIVES THE INDIVIDUAL POINT OF

02:33:48.185 --> 02:33:50.387
CONTACT THAT THEY CAN TALK TO-

02:33:50.454 --> 02:33:53.924
BY EMAIL IF THEY HAVE QUESTIONS

02:33:53.991 --> 02:33:55.092
ABOUT PROCESS AND HOW TO ACCESS

02:33:55.159 --> 02:33:56.994
IT- INDIVIDUALS CAN REQUEST. AN

02:33:57.061 --> 02:33:59.063
ORAL TELEPHONIC HEARING FOR

02:33:59.129 --> 02:34:00.064
CONSIDERATION OF A WRITTEN

02:34:00.130 --> 02:34:02.833

WHEN KOBE CAME ABOUT THERE WAS A

02:34:10.441 --> 02:34:11.475
NEED TO CHANGE THE PROCESS

02:34:11.542 --> 02:34:13.243
BECAUSE INDIVIDUALS. COULD

02:34:13.310 --> 02:34:16.780
ALREADY ACCESS IT- SO THAT THAT

02:34:16.847 --> 02:34:18.215
REALLY CREATES A NICE EASE OF

02:34:18.282 --> 02:34:19.950
USE FOR PEOPLE AND IT DECREASES

02:34:20.017 --> 02:34:21.318
THEIR COSTS BECAUSE THEY DON'T

02:34:21.385 --> 02:34:23.153
HAVE TO TRAVEL TO A LOCATION.

02:34:23.220 --> 02:34:25.889
AND MISS WORK FOR THE TIME TO DO

02:34:25.956 --> 02:34:27.324

02:34:45.576 --> 02:34:46.677
AND CHALLENGE THAT BEFORE THAT

02:34:46.744 --> 02:34:48.512

I ASK YOU WHO HERE'S THE ISSUE

02:35:37.861 --> 02:35:39.296
THE ISSUES ARE HEARD BY

DEDICATED HEARING OFFICERS. SO

02:35:42.132 --> 02:35:44.068
THAT'S WHO DECIDES THE MATTERS

02:35:44.134 --> 02:35:45.569
HE TALKED ON THIS GUY STARTED IT

02:35:45.636 --> 02:35:47.337

LAW ENFORCEMENT OR IN MASSAGE.

02:36:05.489 --> 02:36:06.657
SO GENERALLY HEARING OFFICERS

02:36:06.724 --> 02:36:08.592
ARE INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE LAW

02:36:08.659 --> 02:36:10.160

02:36:39.623 --> 02:36:41.658
MUCH LIKE A STAFF COUNCIL MIGHT.

02:36:41.725 --> 02:36:43.594
PROVIDE OPINIONS AND ANALYSIS TO

02:36:43.660 --> 02:36:45.662
A CITY CITY COUNCIL STAFF

02:36:45.729 --> 02:36:48.432
COUNCIL PROVIDES THEM WITH-

02:36:48.499 --> 02:36:51.168

THE PROCEDURES- ADDRESSING LEGAL

02:36:59.376 --> 02:37:01.211
ARGUMENTS THAT MIGHT GET ME IS

02:37:01.278 --> 02:37:02.980
MADE IN BRIEFS. IT'S ALWAYS

02:37:03.046 --> 02:37:04.648
ENSURED THAT THE HEARING

02:37:04.715 --> 02:37:06.450
OFFICERS HAVE NO CONFLICT OF

02:37:06.517 --> 02:37:08.018
INTEREST. SO THEY HAVE NO

02:37:08.085 --> 02:37:09.620
PECUNIARY INTEREST IN THE

02:37:09.686 --> 02:37:11.688
MATTERS BEFORE THEM. THERE'S NO

02:37:11.755 --> 02:37:14.291
RELATIONSHIP OF ANY KIND WITH

02:37:14.358 --> 02:37:16.160
THE INDIVIDUALS BEFORE THEM. ARE

02:37:16.226 --> 02:37:17.761
THERE NOT TO MENTION MATTERS

02:37:17.828 --> 02:37:19.329
WITH THE INDIVIDUAL THEY'VE NOT

02:37:19.396 --> 02:37:20.864
BEEN TARGETS OF ABUSE BY THE

02:37:20.931 --> 02:37:22.432
INDIVIDUAL WE'RE NOT FRIENDS OR

02:37:22.499 --> 02:37:24.701
RELATIVES OF THE INDIVIDUAL. AND

02:37:24.768 --> 02:37:27.070
REALLY MORE IMPORTANTLY. THEY

02:37:27.137 --> 02:37:28.906
ONLY HEAR THE MATTER AT THE END

02:37:28.972 --> 02:37:31.074
SO THEY ARE NOT INVOLVED AS AN

02:37:31.141 --> 02:37:33.143
INVESTIGATOR A FACT FINDER

02:37:33.210 --> 02:37:34.912
FINDER WARRANT INITIAL DECISION

02:37:34.978 --> 02:37:37.581
MAKER. IN THE PROCESS THAT LEADS

02:37:37.648 --> 02:37:39.149
UP TO THE INDIVIDUAL GETTING A

02:37:39.216 --> 02:37:41.051
LETTER PROPOSING TO DENY OR

02:37:41.118 --> 02:37:42.719
DISCIPLINE THEM THINGS SENSUALLY

02:37:42.786 --> 02:37:44.488
HEARING OFFICERS COME INTO A

02:37:44.555 --> 02:37:47.124
COLD. I ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT

02:37:47.191 --> 02:37:48.725
THAT THE HEARING OFFICERS. IT IS

02:37:48.792 --> 02:37:50.727
NOT A DECISION MADE BY AN

02:37:50.794 --> 02:37:52.896
INDIVIDUAL IT'S A DECISION MADE

02:37:52.963 --> 02:37:58.402
BY A BODY. SO THERE HAS TO BE A

02:37:58.468 --> 02:38:00.270
MINIMUM LOOK TO HEARING OFFICER

02:38:00.337 --> 02:38:01.305
THAT HERE EVERY. GENERALLY WE

02:38:01.371 --> 02:38:02.606
HAVE THREE FOUR AND IT'S A

02:38:02.673 --> 02:38:04.208
MATURE RULE. SO WE HAVE TO

02:38:04.274 --> 02:38:05.876
HEARING ON. THEY HAVE TO DECIDE

02:38:05.943 --> 02:38:08.111
UNANIMOUSLY- AND- I CAN'T

02:38:08.178 --> 02:38:09.880
REMEMBER WHILE IT'S NOT REQUIRED

02:38:09.947 --> 02:38:11.315
IF THERE'S THREE OR FOUR HEARING

02:38:11.381 --> 02:38:13.317
OFFICERS ON A ON A MATTER. I

02:38:13.383 --> 02:38:14.551
CANNOT REMEMBER THE LAST TIME A

02:38:14.618 --> 02:38:16.053
DECISION WAS DECIDED THAT WAS

02:38:16.119 --> 02:38:19.256
NOT UNANIMOUS GREAT AND AGAIN

02:38:19.323 --> 02:38:20.858
HEARING OFFICERS AS A BODY

02:38:20.924 --> 02:38:22.960
THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES WITH THE

02:38:23.026 --> 02:38:24.628
AUTHORITY TO MAKE A FINAL

02:38:24.695 --> 02:38:25.596
DECISION. IN THAT DECISION

02:38:25.662 --> 02:38:28.131
CANNOT BE MADE BY THE BOARD- CAN

02:38:28.198 --> 02:38:29.666
BE MADE BY STAFF OR STAFF

02:38:29.733 --> 02:38:31.568
ATTORNEYS- SO THEY'RE

02:38:31.635 --> 02:38:33.537
INDEPENDENT AND THEY THEY MAKE

02:38:33.604 --> 02:38:36.340
THESE DECISIONS- VERY WELL I

02:38:36.406 --> 02:38:37.374
HAVE TO SAY I'M ALWAYS

OFFICERS- THERE REALLY DILIGENT-

02:38:42.012 --> 02:38:43.547
THEY SPEND THEIR TIME REALLY

02:38:43.614 --> 02:38:45.916
DEBATING ISSUES. AND CONSIDERING

02:38:45.983 --> 02:38:47.084

THE CORNERSTONE OF THIS POGRAM

02:41:31.648 --> 02:41:34.384
IS THE REQUIREMENTS TO HAVE THE

02:41:34.451 --> 02:41:37.120

02:41:37.187 --> 02:41:39.723

02:41:49.666 --> 02:41:52.202
REALLY A DECISION THAT IT'S BEST

02:41:52.269 --> 02:41:54.371
LEFT FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO

02:41:54.438 --> 02:41:57.507
DECIDE BECAUSE THE BEAUTY OF THE

02:41:57.574 --> 02:41:59.876
STATE LAW THAT THE CREATION OF

02:41:59.943 --> 02:42:01.611
STATEWIDE CERTIFICATION PROGRAM

02:42:01.678 --> 02:42:03.246
MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR LOCAL

02:42:03.313 --> 02:42:05.916
COMMUNITY TO A DOCTOR- THIS

02:42:05.982 --> 02:42:07.284
PROGRAM AND TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

02:42:07.350 --> 02:42:09.986
IT BUT IN SOME LOCAL COMMUNITIES

02:42:10.053 --> 02:42:11.788
MAYBE IT MAKES SENSE FOR THEM

02:42:11.855 --> 02:42:13.523
NOT TO REQUIRE IT FOR EXAMPLE.

02:42:13.590 --> 02:42:15.892
THE MANY THERAPISTS IN OUR

02:42:15.959 --> 02:42:17.494
INDUSTRY REFERRED TO THEM AS

02:42:17.561 --> 02:42:19.229

THERAPISTS WILL BE AROUND FOR

02:42:22.566 --> 02:42:23.333
TWENTY THIRTY FORTY YEARS HARD

CORN REQUIREMENT IN STATE LAW

02:42:30.207 --> 02:42:32.576
THE EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS SO

02:42:32.642 --> 02:42:34.978
IF A LOCAL COMMUNITY HAS THIS

02:42:35.045 --> 02:42:37.647
ISSUE THEY CAN ALLOW THESE

02:42:37.714 --> 02:42:40.117
INDIVIDUALS TO WORK AND TO SERVE

02:42:40.183 --> 02:42:42.219
THE COMMUNITY EVEN THOUGH THEY

02:42:42.285 --> 02:42:44.254
DON'T NEED THIS THE HIGHER

02:42:44.321 --> 02:42:46.990
REQUIREMENTS. ISN'T THAT WE HAVE

02:42:47.057 --> 02:42:49.226
RIGHT NOW IN THE STATE LAW SO WE

02:42:49.292 --> 02:42:55.098
BELIEVE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING.

02:42:55.165 --> 02:42:56.366

EMULATED WHAT WE HAVE I DONE

02:44:22.252 --> 02:44:24.888
HERE BUT THIS IS THE KEY AND

02:44:24.955 --> 02:44:26.489
HAVING WORKED IN THIS INDUSTRY

02:44:26.556 --> 02:44:28.491
AND TAKING DOWN MANY OF THESE

02:44:28.558 --> 02:44:30.427
ILLEGAL MASSAGE PARLORS. IN MY

THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVE OUT OF

02:44:34.431 --> 02:44:36.433
THAT- FOR THESE OPERATORS IF

02:44:36.499 --> 02:44:38.335
THEY BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE

02:44:38.401 --> 02:44:39.836
CAPITAL INVESTMENT WILL BE IN

02:44:39.903 --> 02:44:41.171
JEOPARDY IN THE FIRST WEEK IN

02:44:41.238 --> 02:44:43.106
THE FIRST MONTH. THERE ARE A LOT

02:44:43.173 --> 02:44:44.374
LESS LIKELY TO OPEN UP THE

02:44:44.441 --> 02:44:46.610
ILLEGAL CYCLE OR IN THAT.

02:44:46.676 --> 02:44:48.745
JURISDICTION SO THAT'S WHY MANY

02:44:48.812 --> 02:44:52.115
HAVE GOLF BALL IT QUITE FRANKLY-

02:44:52.182 --> 02:44:53.984

02:44:59.723 --> 02:45:01.157
OPERATION FOR A YEAR INSIDE I

02:45:01.224 --> 02:45:03.260
GOTTA LOOK INTO THIS THAT. WAS

02:45:03.326 --> 02:45:05.629
UNBELIEVABLE. BUT MANY OF THEM

02:45:05.695 --> 02:45:07.097
ARE FORCED INTO THAT IN BELIEVE

02:45:07.163 --> 02:45:09.599
ME- THEY ARE WAY BETTER OFF OUT

02:45:09.666 --> 02:45:17.374
OF IT. IN IN MOST OF THEM ARE

02:45:17.440 --> 02:45:19.809
NOT CERTIFIED. THE YOU- I THINK

02:45:19.876 --> 02:45:20.343

DISCIPLINARY IS PROCESS OF.

02:45:29.753 --> 02:45:31.888
HE'LL OF DENIAL OF PROCESS IN

02:45:31.955 --> 02:45:33.990
THE CONVERSATION ABOUT HEARING

02:45:34.057 --> 02:45:36.026
OFFICERS EMBEDDED IN THE COUNCIL

02:45:36.092 --> 02:45:37.327
. YOU KNOW IT OCCURS TO ME THAT

02:45:37.394 --> 02:45:39.462
IT DOESN'T REQUIRE LICENSURE OR

02:45:39.529 --> 02:45:41.798
THE CREATION OF A STATE BOARD TO

02:45:41.865 --> 02:45:43.500
DEAL WITH POTENTIAL ACTUAL OR

02:45:43.566 --> 02:45:46.503
PERCEIVED- DUE PROCESS ISSUES.

02:45:46.569 --> 02:45:49.139
SO MY QUESTION IS THIS- TO THE

02:45:49.205 --> 02:45:51.007
COUNCIL AND THE MEMBERS HERE.

02:45:51.074 --> 02:45:52.075
HAVE YOU HAVE YOU CONSIDER

INDEPENDENT ARBITRATOR OR A

02:45:57.480 --> 02:46:00.016
JUDGE ON THESE CASES WHERE.

02:46:00.083 --> 02:46:01.418
THESE ARE FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT

02:46:01.484 --> 02:46:02.819
ISSUES APPROVAL DENIAL

02:46:02.886 --> 02:46:04.988
DISCIPLINE NOT. USING THE

02:46:05.055 --> 02:46:06.156
SERVICES OF AN INDEPENDENT

02:46:06.222 --> 02:46:08.391
ARBITRATOR OR A JUDGE FOR

02:46:08.458 --> 02:46:11.227
EXAMPLE RETIRED JUDGE TO LISTEN

02:46:11.294 --> 02:46:13.630
AND ULTIMATELY- MAKE FINDINGS OF

02:46:13.697 --> 02:46:15.198
FACT AND RECOMMENDATIONS

02:46:15.265 --> 02:46:16.299
REGARDING THE DECISION TO THE

02:46:16.366 --> 02:46:18.968
BOARD ITSELF- FOR THE ULTIMATE

02:46:19.035 --> 02:46:24.341
DECISION. YES CHAIRMAN ROB I

02:46:24.407 --> 02:46:25.542
THINK I'LL ADDRESS THAT ISSUE

02:46:25.608 --> 02:46:28.178
THAT'S OKAY SO TO MY KNOWLEDGE

02:46:28.244 --> 02:46:29.479
SEEM TO SEE HASN'T LOOKED AT

02:46:29.546 --> 02:46:31.214
THAT BUT I WILL SAY THAT THAT

02:46:31.281 --> 02:46:33.016
KIND OF A PROCESS IS INCREDIBLY

02:46:33.083 --> 02:46:34.684
EXPENSIVE IF ANYONE'S BEEN

02:46:34.751 --> 02:46:36.586
INVOLVED IN ARBITRATION IT'S NOT

02:46:36.653 --> 02:46:38.088
UNUSUAL THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE TO

02:46:38.154 --> 02:46:40.390
PAY AN ARBITRATOR. IN PAST CASES

02:46:40.457 --> 02:46:41.858
I'VE HAD LITIGATION MATTERS

02:46:41.925 --> 02:46:43.526
WE'RE PAYING ARBITRATORS YOU

02:46:43.593 --> 02:46:45.662
KNOW THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS A DAY

02:46:45.729 --> 02:46:47.297
TO ARBITRATE THE MATTERS AND GET

02:46:47.364 --> 02:46:49.833
GOOD ARBITRATORS HERE SEEM TO

02:46:49.899 --> 02:46:51.134
SEIZE PROCESS IS A VERY

02:46:51.201 --> 02:46:53.837
INDEPENDENT PROCESS- AND I WANT

02:46:53.903 --> 02:46:55.238
TO SAY YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME

02:46:55.305 --> 02:46:57.741
SIMILARITIES TO WHAT WE SEEM TO

02:46:57.807 --> 02:46:59.442
SEE OPERATES WITHIN ITS HEARING

02:46:59.509 --> 02:47:03.046
OFFICERS. THE WAY THAT ALE JAY'S

02:47:03.113 --> 02:47:03.847
WORK BUT YEAH I THINK SEEM

02:47:03.913 --> 02:47:05.382
DISEASE PROCESS IS MORE

02:47:05.448 --> 02:47:07.217
INDEPENDENT THAN THE WAY ALE

02:47:07.283 --> 02:47:09.552
JAY'S WORK FIRST IN OUR STATE

02:47:09.619 --> 02:47:13.990
LICENSURE MATTERS LOWER JUST.

02:47:14.057 --> 02:47:15.125
SAY THAT THE ALE JAY'S

02:47:15.191 --> 02:47:16.960
TYPICALLY. I COULD BE WRONG WORK

02:47:17.026 --> 02:47:18.161
FOR THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE

02:47:18.228 --> 02:47:19.496
LAW. AT LEAST IN MANY CASES AND

02:47:19.562 --> 02:47:20.797
THAT'S SEPARATE FROM WORKING

02:47:20.864 --> 02:47:23.133
DIRECTLY FOR. THE STATE BORDER

02:47:23.199 --> 02:47:26.736
BUREAU OR A OR A STATE AGENCY.

02:47:26.803 --> 02:47:28.538
AND I'M NOT SAYING THERE'S AN

02:47:28.605 --> 02:47:30.106
ISSUE I'M JUST. ASKING THE

02:47:30.173 --> 02:47:31.574
QUESTION BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY

02:47:31.641 --> 02:47:33.243
THERE'S A PERCEIVED ISSUE OR IT

02:47:33.309 --> 02:47:35.945
WOULDN'T BE REFLECTED. IN OUR

02:47:36.012 --> 02:47:39.549
BACKGROUND PAPER AND- I'M NOT

02:47:39.616 --> 02:47:42.419
SURE FIRST OF ALL IF YOU CHARGE

02:47:42.485 --> 02:47:44.421
FOR A VARIETY OF THINGS AND

02:47:44.487 --> 02:47:46.156
CERTAINLY OUR BOARDS AND BUREAUS

02:47:46.222 --> 02:47:47.157
TOO YOU CAN CERTAINLY ASSESS A

02:47:47.223 --> 02:47:50.293
FEE FOR THE USE OF A OF AN

02:47:50.360 --> 02:47:53.396
ARBITRATOR OR A RETIRED JUDGE.

02:47:53.463 --> 02:47:55.365
NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO YOU

02:47:55.432 --> 02:47:57.567
COULD ALSO TRIAGE THE CASES IN

02:47:57.634 --> 02:47:59.803
WHICH THE PROCESS SUPPLIES AND

02:47:59.869 --> 02:48:01.371
RESTRICTED TO ONLY THE MOST

02:48:01.438 --> 02:48:03.506
SERIOUS WHERE SOMEONE'S ABILITY

02:48:03.573 --> 02:48:06.109
TO IN ESSENCE EVEN THOUGH THIS

02:48:06.176 --> 02:48:08.111
IS A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM. WORK IS

02:48:08.178 --> 02:48:10.680
IN JEOPARDY OR- SCHOOLS ABILITY

02:48:10.747 --> 02:48:13.516
TO FUNCTION. IS IN JEOPARDY SO

02:48:13.583 --> 02:48:15.785
THAT'S WHY I ASKED THE QUESTION

02:48:15.852 --> 02:48:17.153
. SURE AND I UNDERSTAND THE

02:48:17.220 --> 02:48:18.321
QUESTION BUT I WOULD JUST LIKE

02:48:18.388 --> 02:48:20.857
TO POINT OUT THAT IN A MINUTE

02:48:20.924 --> 02:48:22.625
RIGHT IT MINISTRY OF LAW JUDGES.

02:48:22.692 --> 02:48:24.961
THE WORK THAT THEY DO IS PAID

02:48:25.028 --> 02:48:26.463
FOR BY THE AGENCIES THAT THEY

02:48:26.529 --> 02:48:28.731
PROVIDE THE WORKFORCE SO IT'S A

02:48:28.798 --> 02:48:29.599
VERY ANALOGOUS IT'S REALLY NOT

02:48:29.666 --> 02:48:31.334
THAT DIFFERENT. THE OTHER THING

02:48:31.401 --> 02:48:32.902
ABOUT ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES

02:48:32.969 --> 02:48:35.905
WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENS FOR- IF

02:48:35.972 --> 02:48:37.640
SOMEONE HAS A STATE LICENSE. AN

02:48:37.707 --> 02:48:40.009
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE ISSUES

02:48:40.076 --> 02:48:42.445
A PROPOSED DECISION THEY DO NOT

02:48:42.512 --> 02:48:44.747
ISSUE A FINAL DECISION. AND THEN

02:48:44.814 --> 02:48:47.083
THE BOARD ITSELF DECIDES WHAT TO

02:48:47.150 --> 02:48:49.018
DO WITH THAT PROPOSED DECISION.

02:48:49.085 --> 02:48:51.454
AND THIS IS A GOVERNMENT CODE

02:48:51.521 --> 02:48:53.389
SECTION ELEVEN FIVE ONE SEVEN.

02:48:53.456 --> 02:48:57.093
C. ONE. SO THE BOARD CAN DO

02:48:57.160 --> 02:48:58.495
NOTHING AND JUST ADOPT THE

02:48:58.561 --> 02:49:00.430
DECISION- IF THAT'S HOW THEY

02:49:00.497 --> 02:49:02.899
LIKE TO ADDRESS IT. THE US THEY

02:49:02.966 --> 02:49:04.868
CAN DOCTOR IN THEIR ENTIRETY.

02:49:04.934 --> 02:49:06.836
THEY CAN REJECT THE DECISION AND

02:49:06.903 --> 02:49:08.438
REFERRED BACK TO NAIL J. THEY

02:49:08.505 --> 02:49:09.672
CAN MAKE CHANGES TO THE

02:49:09.739 --> 02:49:11.674
DECISION. AND THEY CAN REJECT

02:49:11.741 --> 02:49:12.942
THE DECISION AND DECIDE THE

02:49:13.009 --> 02:49:16.112
MATTER FOR THEMSELVES. SO I

02:49:16.179 --> 02:49:17.547
UNDERSTAND THESE ISSUES ARE

02:49:17.614 --> 02:49:20.383
RAISED AND- YOU KNOW WE'RE HERE

02:49:20.450 --> 02:49:22.085
TO ADDRESS THEM. BUT I THINK THE

02:49:22.151 --> 02:49:23.353
PROCESS IS APPROPRIATE

02:49:23.419 --> 02:49:24.687
COMPLIANCE WITH THE FAIR

02:49:24.754 --> 02:49:26.956
PROCEDURE DOCTOR IN COMMON LAW-

02:49:27.023 --> 02:49:28.725
THERE ARE NO CONFLICTS OF

02:49:28.791 --> 02:49:29.559
INTEREST AND THE HEARING

02:49:29.626 --> 02:49:31.728
OFFICER. OFFICERS ARE VERY WELL

02:49:31.794 --> 02:49:34.531
THAT IT. AND I THINK YOU HAVE TO

02:49:34.597 --> 02:49:36.199
BE CAREFUL ABOUT WANTING TO. PUT

02:49:36.266 --> 02:49:38.201
IN A VERY EXPENSIVE PROCESS ON

02:49:38.268 --> 02:49:40.203
INDIVIDUALS. WHO DON'T

02:49:40.270 --> 02:49:42.272
NECESSARILY HAVE THE RESOURCES

02:49:42.338 --> 02:49:46.943
AND FINANCES TO AFFORD IT- SO

02:49:47.010 --> 02:49:47.510
THAT'S ALWAYS A CONCERN YOU

02:49:47.577 --> 02:49:49.145
KNOW. IN ST. I DON'T USUALLY

02:49:49.212 --> 02:49:51.714
GIVE THEM A CHOICE. BUT IN IN

02:49:51.781 --> 02:49:53.116
SITUATIONS I'VE SEEN AND STATE

02:49:53.182 --> 02:49:54.350
BOARDS FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE

02:49:54.417 --> 02:49:56.152
BOARD OF THE COUNTY THERE MIGHT

02:49:56.219 --> 02:49:57.620
BE AN ACTION AND THEN THEY GET

02:49:57.687 --> 02:49:59.155
THAT MONEY BACK THAT THEY PAY

02:49:59.222 --> 02:50:01.257
FOR THAT TO PROCESS THE- A

02:50:01.324 --> 02:50:02.625
COUNTY BOARD FOR EXAMPLE CAN

02:50:02.692 --> 02:50:06.930
REQUEST THAT MONEY BACK- AND- IN

02:50:06.996 --> 02:50:08.498
THOSE INDUSTRIES THERE'S ENOUGH

02:50:08.565 --> 02:50:10.433
MONEY WHERE INDIVIDUALS. WILL

02:50:10.500 --> 02:50:12.435
PAY YOU TO BE LICENSED AGAIN

02:50:12.502 --> 02:50:13.703
BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE FINANCES

02:50:13.770 --> 02:50:15.438
TO DO IT YOU KNOW MIGHT BE

02:50:15.505 --> 02:50:16.639
TWENTY OR THIRTY THOUSAND

02:50:16.706 --> 02:50:17.974
DOLLARS FOR INACTION HERE ARE

02:50:18.041 --> 02:50:19.208
YOU TALKING ABOUT INDIVIDUALS

02:50:19.275 --> 02:50:20.877
THAT ARE MAKING A MUCH LOWER

02:50:20.944 --> 02:50:23.246
AMOUNT OF MONEY PER HOUR. AND

02:50:23.313 --> 02:50:25.448
DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE AT

02:50:25.515 --> 02:50:28.585
THE FINANCES TO PAY FOR THAT

02:50:28.651 --> 02:50:30.353
TYPE OF DUE PROCESS WITH ELEVEN

02:50:30.420 --> 02:50:31.821
YEARS AGO GOOD THE SLIGHTLY

02:50:31.888 --> 02:50:37.093
DIFFERENT QUESTION SURE IF COST

02:50:37.160 --> 02:50:38.728
ISN'T AS A FACTOR AND- THE

02:50:38.795 --> 02:50:39.362
DETERMINATION IS MADE TO KEEP

02:50:39.429 --> 02:50:40.897
THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS

02:50:40.964 --> 02:50:43.232
INTERNAL TO THE COUNCIL. WHY

02:50:43.299 --> 02:50:45.001
WOULD THE COUNCIL BOARD DELEGATE

02:50:45.068 --> 02:50:46.936
FINAL AUTHORITY TO HEARING

02:50:47.003 --> 02:50:49.372
OFFICER EMPLOYEES. AND NOT

02:50:49.439 --> 02:50:51.474
PROVIDE AN AVENUE FOR APPEAL TO

02:50:51.541 --> 02:50:53.610
THE COUNCIL. IF THE INDIVIDUALS

02:50:53.676 --> 02:50:56.012
OR THE ENTITIES IMPACTED

02:50:56.079 --> 02:50:57.013
DISAGREE WITH THE HEARING

02:50:57.080 --> 02:51:00.516
OFFICER'S DECISION. WELL SO. IF

02:51:00.583 --> 02:51:01.618
YOU'RE ASKING WHETHER THERE IS

02:51:01.684 --> 02:51:03.152
AN APPEAL I'M I WANT TO MAKE

02:51:03.219 --> 02:51:04.954
SURE I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION

02:51:05.021 --> 02:51:07.190
ARE YOU ASKING WHETHER THERE IS

02:51:07.256 --> 02:51:07.757
AN APPEAL PROCESS WELL I'M

02:51:07.824 --> 02:51:09.025
LOOKING AT THE BACK ROOM OF

02:51:09.092 --> 02:51:10.059
TALKING ABOUT DENIED SCHOOLS

02:51:10.126 --> 02:51:11.861
RIGHT HERE. OKAY WELL SCHOOLS

02:51:11.928 --> 02:51:13.896
ARE A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT

02:51:13.963 --> 02:51:15.798
PROCESS SO- I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS

02:51:15.865 --> 02:51:17.133
SCHOOLS BUT SCHOOLS HAVE A VERY

02:51:17.200 --> 02:51:17.967
DIFFERENT PROCESS THAN

02:51:18.034 --> 02:51:19.969
INDIVIDUALS AND THERE'S TWO

02:51:20.036 --> 02:51:21.204
DIFFERENT REASONS BUT ONE OF THE

02:51:21.270 --> 02:51:23.139
REASONS HAS A COOL COOL STILL

02:51:23.206 --> 02:51:24.841
USE A HEARING OFFICER CONCEPT

02:51:24.907 --> 02:51:28.478
TO. PAGE THIRTY FIVE THIRTY FIVE

02:51:28.544 --> 02:51:30.213
OF OUR BACKGROUND PAPER. AND

02:51:30.279 --> 02:51:32.115
MAYBE IT'S A DIFFERENT CERTAINLY

02:51:32.181 --> 02:51:32.615
A DIFFERENT. CERTAINLY A

02:51:32.682 --> 02:51:36.119
DIFFERENT SUBJECT. BUT MY

02:51:36.185 --> 02:51:37.954
QUESTION IS- IT RELATES TO THIS

02:51:38.021 --> 02:51:39.622
STATEMENT A DENIED SCHOOLS SUCH

02:51:39.689 --> 02:51:41.691
AS THE ONE IN THE RECENT CASE

02:51:41.758 --> 02:51:42.458
HAS NO OPTION FOR APPEALING A

02:51:42.525 --> 02:51:45.328
CA. CA MTC DECISION. EXCEPT TO

02:51:45.395 --> 02:51:47.096
DIFFERENT SEGMENTS OF THE CMT C.

02:51:47.163 --> 02:51:49.499
ITSELF I EITHER TO HEARING

02:51:49.565 --> 02:51:52.568
OFFICERS. WHAT SORRY I'M SORRY

02:51:52.635 --> 02:51:54.170
CENTER OFF THAT IS NOT FACTUALLY

02:51:54.237 --> 02:51:57.674
CORRECT SO FOR SCHOOL PROCEDURE

02:51:57.740 --> 02:51:59.575
UP SCHOOLS FIRST OF ALL HAVE THE

02:51:59.642 --> 02:52:01.544
RIGHT TO FULL PROCEDURE THE

02:52:01.611 --> 02:52:03.479
PROCESS IS VERY FAIR OPEN AND

02:52:03.546 --> 02:52:05.481
TRANSPARENT THEY'RE PROVIDED

02:52:05.548 --> 02:52:07.316
WITH ALL THE EVIDENCE AGAIN WITH

02:52:07.383 --> 02:52:09.018
THE PROPOSED DECISION LONGER

02:52:09.085 --> 02:52:11.354
TIME FRAMES FOR SCHOOLS SCHOOLS

02:52:11.421 --> 02:52:13.556
MATTERS ARE HEARD- AGAIN BY A

02:52:13.623 --> 02:52:15.458
MINIMUM OF TWO HEARING FFICERS

02:52:15.525 --> 02:52:17.860
BUT GENERALLY THREE AND THEN IF

02:52:17.927 --> 02:52:19.395
SCHOOLS AREN'T HAPPY WITH THAT

02:52:19.462 --> 02:52:20.196
DECISION THEY DO YOU HAVE THE

02:52:20.263 --> 02:52:22.899
RIGHT TO APPEAL IT TO THE FULL

02:52:22.965 --> 02:52:25.301
BOARD- AND THEY HAVE I CAN SEE

02:52:25.368 --> 02:52:26.636
WHERE MEMBER COUNTY SHAKING HIS

02:52:26.703 --> 02:52:29.005
HEAD BECAUSE HE'S BEEN HE'S

02:52:29.072 --> 02:52:30.106
HEARD THOSE APPEALS WILL

02:52:30.173 --> 02:52:32.041
CONTINUE TO GO TO THE FULL BOARD

02:52:32.108 --> 02:52:37.814
AND THEY KIND OF KILL IT OR NOT. A LABOR IT'S NOT TO BELABOR IT

02:52:37.880 --> 02:52:39.315
THEN. OUR BACKGROUND PAPER ON

02:52:39.382 --> 02:52:40.883
PAGE THIRTY FIVE IN THE LITTLE

02:52:40.950 --> 02:52:41.451
PAGE IS INCORRECT AND LET'S

02:52:41.517 --> 02:52:43.219
FOCUS ON THE DISCIPLINE CASES TO

02:52:43.286 --> 02:52:45.354
DISCIPLINE CASES IN THE CASE OF

02:52:45.421 --> 02:52:47.056
A DISCIPLINE CASES AN INDIVIDUAL

02:52:47.123 --> 02:52:49.659
BEING DISCIPLINED WHO HAS HIS

02:52:49.726 --> 02:52:53.229
HER OR THEIR- CASE HEARD BY THE

02:52:53.296 --> 02:52:55.965
TWO OR THREE HEARING OFFICERS I

02:52:56.032 --> 02:52:56.699
THINK YOU MENTIONED TWO DOES

02:52:56.766 --> 02:52:57.667
THAT INDIVIDUAL HAVE THE

02:52:57.734 --> 02:52:59.268
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THAT

02:52:59.335 --> 02:53:01.571
DISCIPLINARY DECISION APPEALED

02:53:01.637 --> 02:53:03.940
TO THE FULL BOARD. THEY DO NOT

02:53:04.006 --> 02:53:05.942
SO INDIVIDUAL CERTIFICATION

02:53:06.008 --> 02:53:09.512
MATTERS- AGAIN REQUIRED TO VAST

02:53:09.579 --> 02:53:11.147
MAJORITY WE HAVE THREE OR FOUR

02:53:11.214 --> 02:53:12.548
HEARINGS I'M SORRY HEARING

02:53:12.615 --> 02:53:14.517
OFFICERS ON THE HEARING SO HE'S

02:53:14.584 --> 02:53:16.152
A MINIMUM CASE SOMEONE GETS SICK

02:53:16.219 --> 02:53:17.653
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. BUT THE

02:53:17.720 --> 02:53:19.322
WAY THAT- THE WAY THAT IT'S RUN

02:53:19.388 --> 02:53:21.257
IT'S ALMOST ALWAYS THREE HEARING

02:53:21.324 --> 02:53:23.559
OFFICERS. THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO

02:53:23.626 --> 02:53:25.795
BRING AN ACTION SUPERIOR COURT

02:53:25.862 --> 02:53:27.864
SO THEY WOULD BRING A PETITION

02:53:27.930 --> 02:53:28.798
FOR WRIT OF MANDATE CHALLENGING

02:53:28.865 --> 02:53:31.067
THE DECISION. AND THAT IS THEIR

02:53:31.134 --> 02:53:33.803
LEVEL OF APPEAL WHICH IS

02:53:33.870 --> 02:53:34.837
PROBABLY MORE EXPENSIVE THAN

02:53:34.904 --> 02:53:36.539
HAVING A THIRD JUDGE YOUR

02:53:36.606 --> 02:53:37.640

GIVEN TO. ALLOWING INDIVIDUALS.

02:53:45.414 --> 02:53:47.483
WHO FOR EXAMPLE ARE SUBJECT TO

02:53:47.550 --> 02:53:50.553
HAVING THEIR OR HAVE. HAD THEIR

02:53:50.620 --> 02:53:53.890
CERTIFICATION WITHDRAWN THAT'S

02:53:53.956 --> 02:53:57.059
THE PROPER TERM. BE ABLE TO TAKE

02:53:57.126 --> 02:54:00.496
THAT DECISION TO THE FULL BOARD

02:54:00.563 --> 02:54:04.000
GIVEN THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON

02:54:04.066 --> 02:54:06.169
THEIR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO

02:54:06.235 --> 02:54:09.839
WORK. AND AGAIN SENATOR ALSO TO

02:54:09.906 --> 02:54:11.440
MY KNOWLEDGE IT HAS NOT AND THAT

02:54:11.507 --> 02:54:13.376
HAS TO DO WITH IT'S A VOLUME

02:54:13.442 --> 02:54:15.511
ISSUE C. N. T. AND THE TIMING

02:54:15.578 --> 02:54:17.847

INSTITUTED WITH IN THE BOARD.

02:54:26.189 --> 02:54:27.890
THEN I THINK THAT THAT THAT

02:54:27.957 --> 02:54:29.125
WOULD BE MEETINGS EVERY WEEK

02:54:29.192 --> 02:54:30.726
POTENTIALLY I MEAN IT WOULD BE A

02:54:30.793 --> 02:54:32.662
SIGNIFICANT BURDEN ON VOLUNTEER

03:04:24.086 --> 03:04:26.054
COUNTY IS TO ENSURE PUBLIC

03:04:26.121 --> 03:04:27.623
SAFETY THROUGH THE PREVENTION

03:04:27.689 --> 03:04:29.992
AND PROSECUTION OF CRIME HUMAN

03:04:30.058 --> 03:04:32.461
TRAFFICKING IS A VERY COMPLEX

03:04:32.528 --> 03:04:34.329
CRIME AND THERE CAN BE MANY

03:04:34.396 --> 03:04:36.532
VARIANCES IN THE FORM THAT IT

03:04:36.598 --> 03:04:38.400
TAKES AND THE MOTIVATING FACTORS

03:04:38.467 --> 03:04:40.969
OF THE PARTIES INVOLVED. IT IS

03:04:41.036 --> 03:04:44.039
ALSO A CRIME THAT HIDES IN PLAIN

03:04:44.106 --> 03:04:47.342
SIGHT. ITS INSIDIOUSNESS OFTEN

03:04:47.409 --> 03:04:50.412
WEARS A MASK OF RESPECTABILITY

03:04:50.479 --> 03:04:53.081
OR HARMLESSNESS. THE AMERICAN

03:04:53.148 --> 03:04:55.050
MASSAGE THERAPY ASSOCIATION

03:04:55.117 --> 03:04:56.819
CLAIMS THAT HUMAN TRAFFICKING

03:04:56.885 --> 03:04:59.955
AND PROSTITUTION IS THE PROVINCE

03:05:00.022 --> 03:05:03.025
OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THIS IS

03:05:03.091 --> 03:05:05.494
REALLY A VERY SHORT SIGHTED

03:05:05.561 --> 03:05:08.297
STATEMENTS WHILE POLICE WERE

03:05:08.363 --> 03:05:10.766
ABLE TO INTERVENE WHEN THEY SEE

03:05:10.833 --> 03:05:12.234
SOMETHING OR WHEN SOMEONE

03:05:12.301 --> 03:05:13.802
REACHES OUT TO THEM USUALLY BY

03:05:13.869 --> 03:05:16.205
CALLING NINE ONE ONE. THE

03:05:16.271 --> 03:05:18.173
REALITY IS THAT THIS CRIME

03:05:18.240 --> 03:05:21.243
OCCURS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS

03:05:21.310 --> 03:05:23.912
MAKING IT NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TASK

03:05:23.979 --> 03:05:26.582
FOR POLICE TO OBSERVE AND

03:05:26.648 --> 03:05:28.717
INTERVENE. THE VICTIMS OF THIS

03:05:28.784 --> 03:05:31.353
CRIME ARE OFTEN OUR MOST

03:05:31.420 --> 03:05:32.888
VULNERABLE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN

03:05:32.955 --> 03:05:34.890
MANIPULATED AND CONTROLLED

03:05:34.957 --> 03:05:36.925
ENERGY SIMPLY UNACCUSTOMED TO

03:05:36.992 --> 03:05:39.728
HAVING A WEIGHT. LET ALONE

03:05:39.795 --> 03:05:41.930
MAKING A NINE ONE ONE CALL. IT

03:05:41.997 --> 03:05:44.933
IS A CRIME UNLIKE SO MANY OTHER

03:05:45.000 --> 03:05:47.870
CRIMES WHICH REQUIRES A MULTI

03:05:47.936 --> 03:05:50.372
PRONGED APPROACH WITH MANY

03:05:50.439 --> 03:05:53.575
DIFFERENT PARTNERS. C. M. T. C.

03:05:53.642 --> 03:05:56.278
HAS BEEN A TERRIFIC RESOURCE IN

03:05:56.345 --> 03:05:57.646
THE FIGHT AGAINST HUMAN

03:05:57.713 --> 03:06:01.149
TRAFFICKING THE C. A. MTC IS

03:06:01.216 --> 03:06:03.652
PART OF THE SOLUTION. IT

03:06:03.719 --> 03:06:05.687
PROVIDES SPECIAL ATTENTION WITH

03:06:05.754 --> 03:06:07.656
CONSISTENT MEASURES THAT DO NOT

03:06:07.723 --> 03:06:10.893
EXIST IN CALIFORNIA'S CONSUMER

03:06:10.959 --> 03:06:12.628
PROTECTION BUREAUCRACY. THE

03:06:12.694 --> 03:06:16.098
COLLABORATIVE NATURE OF CMT C.

03:06:16.164 --> 03:06:18.400
IS WHAT SEPARATES THEM FROM

03:06:18.467 --> 03:06:21.570
LICENSING BOARDS. SANTA CLARA

03:06:21.637 --> 03:06:24.673

THERE IS NO MEANINGFUL

03:07:21.897 --> 03:07:25.767
COLLABORATION BECAUSE EVERYONE

03:07:25.834 --> 03:07:27.769
IS IN THEIR OWN SILO. WHEN THERE

03:07:27.836 --> 03:07:30.372

03:07:40.749 --> 03:07:43.151
AND COLLABORATION AS PART OF THE

03:07:43.218 --> 03:07:46.555
SOLUTION. YOUR SHIFT WAS C. A.

03:07:46.622 --> 03:07:50.459

03:08:00.902 --> 03:08:03.639
IF THE C. M. D. C. WERE BROKEN

03:08:03.705 --> 03:08:07.676

03:08:10.512 --> 03:08:12.748

FIX IT AND THIS IS STILL TRUE

03:08:22.624 --> 03:08:25.394

BUSINESSES THAT MAKE UP MOST OF

03:09:27.322 --> 03:09:29.191
OUR INDUSTRY. I WANT TO GIVE

03:09:29.257 --> 03:09:30.592
THIS LITTLE CONTEXT IN WHICH

03:09:30.659 --> 03:09:32.294
THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT WHETHER

AND THOSE ARE NOT MY MEMBERS

03:09:48.410 --> 03:09:50.545
COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN FOR SEVEN

03:09:50.612 --> 03:09:51.980
TO ELEVEN MONTHS- DRAMATICALLY

03:09:52.047 --> 03:09:53.415
REDUCED INCOMING CUSTOMER

03:09:53.482 --> 03:09:55.250
TRAFFIC AFTER REOPENING

03:09:55.317 --> 03:09:59.387
THERAPISTS- EXITING THE INDUSTRY

03:09:59.454 --> 03:10:00.655
IN DROVES AND OF COURSE

03:10:00.722 --> 03:10:02.224
THERAPISTS ARE THE THING THAT

03:10:02.290 --> 03:10:05.026
MAKES OUR BUSINESSES WORK- IT

03:10:05.093 --> 03:10:07.129
WAS AWFUL- IT WAS TERRIBLE WE'RE

03:10:07.195 --> 03:10:08.964
JUST TRYING TO CATCH YOUR BREATH

03:10:09.030 --> 03:10:10.565
AND STABILIZE AND WE'RE TRYING

03:10:10.632 --> 03:10:11.800
TO DO THAT IN. A VERY

03:10:11.867 --> 03:10:13.935
CHALLENGING TIMES WITH EXTREME.

03:10:14.002 --> 03:10:15.570
INFLATION AND THAT SORT OF THING

03:10:15.637 --> 03:10:17.672
SO I OFTEN GET ASKED OFTEN IN

03:10:17.739 --> 03:10:19.174
DIFFERENT ROLES YOU KNOW WHAT

03:10:19.241 --> 03:10:20.842
CAN WE DO WHAT CAN THIS

03:10:20.909 --> 03:10:22.210
LEGISLATURE DUE TO HELP SMALL

03:10:22.277 --> 03:10:23.378
BUSINESS CENTER IN THIS

03:10:23.445 --> 03:10:26.281
PARTICULAR CASE- YOU CAN YOU CAN

03:10:26.348 --> 03:10:28.283
HELP SMALL BUSINESS BY NOT

03:10:28.350 --> 03:10:29.751
PLACING ANY ADDITIONAL BURDENS

03:10:29.818 --> 03:10:31.553
ON US AND WE NEED. REGULATORY

03:10:31.620 --> 03:10:33.555
CERTAINTY AND PREDICTABILITY I

03:10:33.622 --> 03:10:35.357
WE DON'T NEED ANY NEW EXPENSES

03:10:35.423 --> 03:10:36.458
AND WE DON'T NEED REGULATORY

03:10:36.525 --> 03:10:39.895
COMPLEX- SO THAT'S POINT ONE

03:10:39.961 --> 03:10:41.296
ALSO I WANNA MAKE THIS A QUICK

03:10:41.363 --> 03:10:42.764
OBSERVATION ABOUT THIS

03:10:42.831 --> 03:10:45.400
CONVERSATION AND SEEING TO SEE-

03:10:45.467 --> 03:10:47.335
YOU'LL SEE HIM TO SEE IS A

03:10:47.402 --> 03:10:48.637
SUCCESS- IT REFLECTS KIND OF THE

03:10:48.703 --> 03:10:49.604
GENIUS OF THE LEGISLATIVE

03:10:49.671 --> 03:10:51.206
PROCESS DECIDE YOU KNOW WHAT HOW

03:10:51.273 --> 03:10:53.108
ARE WE GOING TO DO THIS. AND

03:10:53.175 --> 03:10:57.512
WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT

03:10:57.579 --> 03:10:59.181
AND THEY GET IT IN A WAY THAT.

03:10:59.247 --> 03:11:00.949
YEAH I THINK WE HAVE TO MINUTES

03:11:01.016 --> 03:11:03.084
NOT. BUT ITS WORK AND AS SOMEONE

03:11:03.151 --> 03:11:04.119
WHO IS- BEEN DOING THIS FOR A

03:11:04.186 --> 03:11:06.054
WHILE IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME

03:11:06.121 --> 03:11:07.956
SINCE I'VE SEEN THIS BREATH. OF

03:11:08.023 --> 03:11:09.891
GROUP COMING TO THE SUPPORT OF

03:11:09.958 --> 03:11:11.393
ANYTHING THAT LOOKS LIKE A

03:11:11.459 --> 03:11:12.594
REGULATED THERE IS WIDESPREAD

03:11:12.661 --> 03:11:14.596
SUPPORT MEANS DEEP- IT'S

03:11:14.663 --> 03:11:16.198
ACTUALLY PRETTY PRETTY PASSION

03:11:16.264 --> 03:11:18.800
AS WELL- AND IF YOU LOOK AT THAT

03:11:18.867 --> 03:11:20.569
THAT'S GOT TO GIVE ONE PAUSE

03:11:20.635 --> 03:11:22.037
ABOUT. A TINKERING WITH WITH

03:11:22.103 --> 03:11:25.140
THAT MODEL- AND ONE MUST THINK

03:11:25.207 --> 03:11:26.675
ABOUT KIND OF THE VALUE THAT IT

03:11:26.741 --> 03:11:28.743
THAT IT BRINGS. SO LET'S TALK

03:11:28.810 --> 03:11:30.445
ABOUT THE SPECIFICS OF LICENSING

03:11:30.512 --> 03:11:31.246
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THIS

03:11:31.313 --> 03:11:33.615
CONVERSATION IN MY MIND IS THAT

03:11:33.682 --> 03:11:34.649
THE LICENSING IS KIND OF BEING

03:11:34.716 --> 03:11:37.118
TALKED ABOUT- UP HERE IS SOME

03:11:37.185 --> 03:11:40.188
KIND OF UNREALIZED GOLD AND- YOU

03:11:40.255 --> 03:11:42.090
KNOW THOUGHT. PROCESS THAT

03:11:42.157 --> 03:11:43.592
DOESN'T REALLY REFLECT WHAT

03:11:43.658 --> 03:11:45.193
HAPPENS IN CALIFORNIA AND WHAT

03:11:45.260 --> 03:11:47.395
HAPPENS IN THE WORLD- I'M VERY

03:11:47.462 --> 03:11:49.364
CONFIDENT THAT THAT THIS WILL

03:11:49.431 --> 03:11:51.766
CREATE HIGHER COSTS- THAT

03:11:51.833 --> 03:11:54.135
INCREASE THE COST OF THE TEST-

03:11:54.202 --> 03:11:55.971
BOTH THE ACTUAL OPPORTUNITY

03:11:56.037 --> 03:11:56.838
BECAUSE THERE WILL BE ADDITIONAL

03:11:56.905 --> 03:11:58.139
BARRIERS TO ENTRY. THERE ARE

03:11:58.206 --> 03:11:59.241
SUGGESTIONS THAT WE'RE GONNA

03:11:59.307 --> 03:12:01.877
NEED C. L. E. WHICH IS ALSO

03:12:01.943 --> 03:12:03.011
GOING TO CREATE COSTS FOR THE

03:12:03.078 --> 03:12:04.412
THERAPIST- MEAL THERE WAS

03:12:04.479 --> 03:12:06.314
REFERENCE TO THE STUDY I MEAN A-

03:12:06.381 --> 03:12:08.717
VERY QUALIFIED. ENTITY THAT

03:12:08.783 --> 03:12:10.352
REGULARLY DOES STUDIES ON THE

03:12:10.418 --> 03:12:13.922
COSTS RELATIVE TO DCA BOARDS AND

03:12:13.989 --> 03:12:15.557
COMMISSIONS- AS IS DONE VERY

03:12:15.624 --> 03:12:17.325
THOROUGH STUDY ON KIND OF WHAT

03:12:17.392 --> 03:12:19.527
IT WILL COST AND IT'S A FIVE

03:12:19.594 --> 03:12:23.565
FOLD INCREASE. IT'S A THOUSAND

03:12:23.632 --> 03:12:25.200
DOLLARS WHATEVER. I'M IT'S NOT

03:12:25.267 --> 03:12:26.534
GONNA BE IN LIKE. WHAT MAYBE

03:12:26.601 --> 03:12:27.535
MAYBE IN MISSISSIPPI- I OR

03:12:27.602 --> 03:12:29.337
ANYTHING LIKE THAT IT WOULD BE A

03:12:29.404 --> 03:12:30.639
CALIFORNIA LICENSE. IN

03:12:30.705 --> 03:12:31.640
CALIFORNIA WHERE THE REGULATORS

03:12:31.706 --> 03:12:32.741
HAVE A STATE OF FORTY MILLION

03:12:32.807 --> 03:12:34.976
PEOPLE. AND IN A VERY DIFFICULT

03:12:35.043 --> 03:12:36.811
TASK AND SO WE SHOULD BE VERY

03:12:36.878 --> 03:12:38.980
CLEAR ABOUT THAT WE SHOULDN'T-

03:12:39.047 --> 03:12:40.415
TRY TO PRETEND THAT THAT'S NOT

03:12:40.482 --> 03:12:43.351
THE CASE- ALSO IF YOU LOOK AT

03:12:43.418 --> 03:12:45.287
IT- YOU KNOW ONE OF THEIR MAJOR

03:12:45.353 --> 03:12:46.321
PROBLEMS FOR WHY WE NEED

03:12:46.388 --> 03:12:48.390
LICENSING IS SO THAT. LAW

03:12:48.456 --> 03:12:49.424
ENFORCEMENT CAN DO ITS JOB

03:12:49.491 --> 03:12:51.393
IRONICALLY TO MEET IS

03:12:51.459 --> 03:12:53.261
UNANIMOUSLY AND WILL SEPARATELY

03:12:53.328 --> 03:12:54.663
LAW ENFORCEMENT IS ON THE OTHER

03:12:54.729 --> 03:12:56.631
SIDE THING THEN AND NOW. WE HAVE

03:12:56.698 --> 03:12:58.533
WHAT WE NEED TO SEE HIM TO SEE

03:12:58.600 --> 03:13:00.268
IS A VERY GOOD PARTNER. AND C.

03:13:00.335 --> 03:13:02.203
M. D. C. ONE OF THE KNOCKS ON US

03:13:02.270 --> 03:13:04.272
YET TO SEE IS THAT IT FOCUSES

03:13:04.339 --> 03:13:06.841
TOO MUCH ON. TRAFFICKING I FIND

03:13:06.908 --> 03:13:08.443
THAT KIND OF AN ASTONISHING

03:13:08.510 --> 03:13:10.779
ASSERTION- THAT IS ONE OF THE

03:13:10.845 --> 03:13:12.314
ISSUES OF THE DAY WHICH REALLY

03:13:12.380 --> 03:13:13.548
NEEDS TO BE. YOU KNOW GOT

03:13:13.615 --> 03:13:18.086
MASTER. AND PARTICULARLY. IN THE

03:13:18.153 --> 03:13:18.887
SENATE DISTRICT- EIGHT YOU KNOW

03:13:18.954 --> 03:13:20.322
. ONE OF THE PRIMARY. I GUESS

03:13:20.388 --> 03:13:22.223
OBJECTIONS TO SEE AND DO YOU SEE

03:13:22.290 --> 03:13:23.725
IS THAT WELL THE DEFICIT THE

03:13:23.792 --> 03:13:25.193
DEFECT IN THE C. M. D. C. MODEL

03:13:25.260 --> 03:13:27.529
IS THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH. OF

03:13:27.595 --> 03:13:28.997
THE C. M. D. C. THERE'S SOME

03:13:29.064 --> 03:13:30.332
THERE'S SOME FOLKS OUT THERE

03:13:30.398 --> 03:13:31.366
OPERATING THAT AREN'T SUBJECT TO

03:13:31.433 --> 03:13:34.602
THE CFTC CERTIFICATION- THE

03:13:34.669 --> 03:13:36.137
ASSUMPTION IS THAT IF THERE'S A

03:13:36.204 --> 03:13:37.539
LICENSING REGIME. EVERYBODY WILL

03:13:37.605 --> 03:13:39.107
GET LICENSE EVERYONE WILL COMPLY

03:13:39.174 --> 03:13:40.508
AND THAT'S JUST. NOT THE

03:13:40.575 --> 03:13:42.377
EXPERIENCE HERE IN CALIFORNIA

03:13:42.444 --> 03:13:44.879
IT'S NOT TRUE- EVERYBODY

03:13:44.946 --> 03:13:46.281
SUPPOSED TO HAVE CAR INSURANCE

03:13:46.348 --> 03:13:47.382
AND THERE'S A DRAMATIC NUMBER OF

03:13:47.449 --> 03:13:49.117
PEOPLE. WHO DON'T HAVE SO IT'S

03:13:49.184 --> 03:13:50.251
NOT REALLY ACTUALLY GONNA SOLVE

03:13:50.318 --> 03:13:53.888
THAT PROBLEM NECESSARILY- SO A

03:13:53.955 --> 03:13:54.489
COUPLE THINGS SPECIFICALLY THE

03:13:54.556 --> 03:13:57.325
FINANCING- THE KIND OF THE BACK

03:13:57.392 --> 03:13:59.527
OF THE ENVELOPE APPROACH THAT I

03:13:59.594 --> 03:14:00.428
SAW WAS SUGGESTED. ONE OF THE

03:14:00.495 --> 03:14:02.630
WAYS THEY'RE GONNA PAY FOR IT IS

03:14:02.697 --> 03:14:05.166
SWEET CMT C. SPOTS. DOES NOT.

03:14:05.233 --> 03:14:06.301
IT'S NOT LEGAL IT WOULD BE A

03:14:06.368 --> 03:14:09.537
TAKE. ON THE REPORT WHICH IS

03:14:09.604 --> 03:14:11.439
LONG I JUST SIXTY PAGES. DOESN'T

03:14:11.506 --> 03:14:13.208
ACTUALLY HAVE A LOT OF REAL DATA

03:14:13.274 --> 03:14:15.643
DATA ABOUT. WHAT'S WRONG WITH C.

03:14:15.710 --> 03:14:17.612
M. D. C. AS IT RELATES TO

03:14:17.679 --> 03:14:19.848
CONSUMERS. AND LICENSEE. I'M NOT

03:14:19.914 --> 03:14:21.516
EVEN ACTUALLY A LOT OF GREAT

03:14:21.583 --> 03:14:23.118
ANECDOTES ABOUT THE GREAT ARM.

03:14:23.184 --> 03:14:24.352
THAT'S HAPPENING THE CALIFORNIAN

03:14:24.419 --> 03:14:26.821
I DON'T HAPPEN TO BELIEVE. THAT

03:14:26.888 --> 03:14:27.922
YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT CONSUMERS

03:14:27.989 --> 03:14:30.458
THINK. IS A GOOD RATIONALE FOR

03:14:30.525 --> 03:14:32.060
TRYING TO GET IN THERE AND DO

03:14:32.127 --> 03:14:33.561
THE KIND OF THIS DRAMATIC

03:14:33.628 --> 03:14:36.097
OVERHAUL OF THE LICENSING OF. A

03:14:36.164 --> 03:14:38.199
GIGANTIC INDUSTRY NOW. IF

03:14:38.266 --> 03:14:39.667
CONSUMERS ARE BEING HARMED IN

03:14:39.734 --> 03:14:44.105
THAT CAN BE SHOWN THAT'S A WHOLE

03:14:44.172 --> 03:14:44.672
DIFFERENT CONVERSATION. THE

03:14:44.739 --> 03:14:46.207
OTHER THING IS- IT IT YOU KNOW

03:14:46.274 --> 03:14:50.245
YOU'RE- DID THEY REPORT ASSUMES

03:14:50.311 --> 03:14:52.147
THAT GOING TO A LICENSING WILL

03:14:52.213 --> 03:14:54.682
ESSENTIALLY CREATE STATEWIDE

03:14:54.749 --> 03:14:55.283
PREEMPTION OF WHAT CITIES AND

03:14:55.350 --> 03:14:57.052
COUNTIES ARE DOING- AND SOMEHOW

03:14:57.118 --> 03:14:59.054
THAT WILL SAVE MONEY FOR THE

03:14:59.120 --> 03:15:00.221
ENTITIES THAT INTERACT IN

03:15:00.288 --> 03:15:01.623
MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS AND THAT

03:15:01.689 --> 03:15:02.991
KIND OF THING THAT HASN'T BEEN

03:15:03.058 --> 03:15:04.459
MY EXPERIENCE THEY ARE NOT GOING

03:15:04.526 --> 03:15:06.661
TO PREEMPT. LOCAL AUTHORITY OVER

03:15:06.728 --> 03:15:08.029
SOME OF THESE ESTABLISHMENTS IF

03:15:08.096 --> 03:15:09.631
WE LEARNED ANYTHING DURING THE

03:15:09.697 --> 03:15:11.266
PANDEMIC WE LEARN THAT YOU KNOW

03:15:11.332 --> 03:15:12.801
LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND PARTICULAR

03:15:12.867 --> 03:15:14.202
HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE AN

03:15:14.269 --> 03:15:16.504
EXTRARDINARY AMOUNT OF CONTROL

03:15:16.571 --> 03:15:18.773
AND THAT'S APPROPRIATE AND

03:15:18.840 --> 03:15:22.043
THAT'S RIGHT- SO. FOR US WHO ARE

03:15:22.110 --> 03:15:23.845
DEEPLY STEEPED IN THE INDUSTRY

03:15:23.912 --> 03:15:26.014
AND WHAT WORKS WE SUPPORT C. M.

03:15:26.081 --> 03:15:28.316
D. C. FROM A COUPLE OTHER THINGS

03:15:28.383 --> 03:15:30.652
IS BRINGING BACK THE EXAM SHOULD

03:15:30.718 --> 03:15:33.588
NOT BE SOMETHING THAT'S- LIFE-

03:15:33.655 --> 03:15:36.558
30% FAIL RATE. CURRENTLY THE

03:15:36.624 --> 03:15:38.293
THERAPIST PROFESSION IS VERY

03:15:38.359 --> 03:15:40.061
ACCESSIBLE IT'S INCREDIBLY

03:15:40.128 --> 03:15:42.730
DIVERSE IT'S NINETY PLUS PERCENT

03:15:42.797 --> 03:15:46.034
WOMEN AND AN EXAM IF NOT DONE

03:15:46.101 --> 03:15:48.570
PROPERLY AND THEY HAVE A

03:15:48.636 --> 03:15:49.604
SPECIFIC EXAMINE MY- UP EITHER

03:15:49.671 --> 03:15:51.573
OWNED. BY THEIR OWN DOCUMENT

03:15:51.639 --> 03:15:53.408
SAYS THEY'LL BE 30% PEOPLE

03:15:53.475 --> 03:15:54.542
THAT'LL BE WASHED OUT OF THE

03:15:54.609 --> 03:15:56.377
INDUSTRY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PASS

03:15:56.444 --> 03:15:57.946
THAT EXAM. THIS BODY HAS BEEN

03:15:58.012 --> 03:15:59.414
VERY CONCERNED OVER THE LAST FEW

03:15:59.481 --> 03:16:01.549
YEARS WHAT AN EXAM DOES FOR

03:16:01.616 --> 03:16:03.318
DIVERSITY INCLUSION AND THAT

03:16:03.384 --> 03:16:05.019
SORT OF THING AND THAT SHOULD BE

03:16:05.086 --> 03:16:06.888
LOOKED AT VERY CAREFULLY. THE

03:16:06.955 --> 03:16:09.524
OTHER THINGS THAT I NOTICE IS-

03:16:09.591 --> 03:16:10.692
THE TIME FRAMES ARE ASTONISHING

03:16:10.758 --> 03:16:12.927
NINETY- DENTISTS TO PACE THE

03:16:12.994 --> 03:16:14.796
IMPOSITION OF A SCOPE OF

03:16:14.863 --> 03:16:16.631
PRACTICE WITHOUT DELAY OR DRUNK.

03:16:16.698 --> 03:16:17.699
ANYBODY WHO'S BEEN INVOLVED

03:16:17.765 --> 03:16:19.067
THERE'S NO PRACTICE CONVERSATION

03:16:19.134 --> 03:16:21.102
IN CALIFORNIA KNOWS THAT'S GOING

03:16:21.169 --> 03:16:25.773
TO BE A MULTI YEAR SLOG AT BEST-

03:16:25.840 --> 03:16:27.242
THOSE. THIS ONE DEFINITELY GOT

03:16:27.308 --> 03:16:28.309
MY ATTENTION THAT THERE WILL BE

03:16:28.376 --> 03:16:29.844
MONITORING SAVINGS FROM

03:16:29.911 --> 03:16:32.747
IMPLEMENTING A NEW IT SYSTEM FOR

03:16:32.814 --> 03:16:35.917
A PUBLIC ENTITY- I'LL LET THAT

03:16:35.984 --> 03:16:37.886
SINK IN FOR JUST A SECOND I

03:16:37.952 --> 03:16:39.621
ASSUME THE CFTC WILL HAND OVER

03:16:39.687 --> 03:16:41.489
ITS DATABASE. OF COURSE THERE'S

03:16:41.556 --> 03:16:43.057
A LOT OF PRIVACY ISSUES ELATED

03:16:43.124 --> 03:16:44.726
TO THAT ONE OF THE WAYS THAT

03:16:44.792 --> 03:16:45.693
THEY'LL DO GRANDFATHERING IS

03:16:45.760 --> 03:16:48.029
ALLOW OR WILL REQUIRE- SOME OF

03:16:48.096 --> 03:16:50.064
THE LEGACY FOLKS. TO HAND OVER

03:16:50.131 --> 03:16:51.299
THEIR TAX RETURNS SO THAT THEY

03:16:51.366 --> 03:16:53.801
CAN PROVE HIMSELF I THINK THIS

03:16:53.868 --> 03:16:56.337
THIS. THIS IDEA. SURFACED A

03:16:56.404 --> 03:16:57.872
COUPLE OF DAYS BEFORE A WINNER

03:16:57.939 --> 03:16:59.774
HEARING WAS ORIGINALLY-

03:16:59.841 --> 03:17:01.743
ORIGINALLY SCHEDULED IT HASN'T

03:17:01.809 --> 03:17:03.611
GOTTEN REALLY ANY KIND OF

03:17:03.678 --> 03:17:05.613
THOROUGH REVIEW AND I WAS REALLY

03:17:05.680 --> 03:17:06.347
DELIGHTED TO HEAR THE CHAIRS

03:17:06.414 --> 03:17:08.783
ASKING SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT

03:17:08.850 --> 03:17:10.518
WHAT'S GOING ON AT THE END YOU

03:17:10.585 --> 03:17:11.686
SEE BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT'S%

03:17:11.753 --> 03:17:13.454
THE PROPER APPROACH AND LET'S

03:17:13.521 --> 03:17:15.557
LET'S DIVE IN LET'S ROLL UP OUR

03:17:15.623 --> 03:17:16.791
SLEEVES. LET'S SEE WHERE THERE

03:17:16.858 --> 03:17:19.928
ARE SOME. CHALLENGES OR ISSUES

03:17:19.994 --> 03:17:21.229
ALWAYS SEEM TO SEE WHERE WE CAN

03:17:21.296 --> 03:17:24.332
IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR THERAPISTS

03:17:24.399 --> 03:17:26.367
FOR THOSE CONSUMERS UP TO THE

03:17:26.434 --> 03:17:28.036
VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING MAYBE

03:17:28.102 --> 03:17:30.071
GIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT MORE TOOLS-

03:17:30.138 --> 03:17:33.341
THAT KIND OF THING- LICENSING AS

03:17:33.408 --> 03:17:34.342
ENVISIONED IN THIS REPORT

03:17:34.409 --> 03:17:36.578
DOESN'T EXIST. IN CALIFORNIA IT

03:17:36.644 --> 03:17:37.979
WILL BE VERY COMPLICATED IT

03:17:38.046 --> 03:17:40.081
WOULD BE VERY EXPENSIVE- AND IT

03:17:40.148 --> 03:17:42.483
WILL BE LAID ON AN INDUSTRY THAT

03:17:42.550 --> 03:17:46.754
IS STRUGGLING- MILE SO I THINK

03:17:46.821 --> 03:17:48.323
FOR US THE ENERGY SPENT TALKING

03:17:48.389 --> 03:17:49.724
ABOUT LICENSING WOULD BE BETTER

03:17:49.791 --> 03:17:52.227
SPENT LOOKING AT. IT BECAUSE WE

03:17:52.293 --> 03:17:53.928
HAVE AN EXISTING INSTANCE YOU

03:17:53.995 --> 03:17:56.064
THAT'S VERY SUCCESSFUL VERY

03:17:56.130 --> 03:17:58.032
ESTABLISHED TO USE KIND OF A

03:17:58.099 --> 03:18:04.105
METAPHOR. THAT BEEN GOING ON IN

03:18:04.172 --> 03:18:06.274
MY HOUSE AT THE- IF THE KITCHEN

03:18:06.341 --> 03:18:07.242
NEEDS REMODEL THAT'S YEAH.

03:18:07.308 --> 03:18:08.209
THAT'S FINE LET'S NOT THIS MAN

03:18:08.276 --> 03:18:10.411
IT AND PRETEND THAT WE CAN BUILD

03:18:10.478 --> 03:18:11.446
SOMETHING BETTER FROM SCRATCH

03:18:11.512 --> 03:18:12.513
OVER HERE IN ANOTHER LOCATION.

03:18:12.580 --> 03:18:14.082
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE

03:18:14.148 --> 03:18:15.883
OPPORTUNITY- HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

03:18:15.950 --> 03:18:16.517
QUESTIONS I'M HAPPY TO- RESPOND

03:18:16.584 --> 03:18:17.885
ANY OTHER THINGS THAT THE

03:18:17.952 --> 03:18:19.354
COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND.

03:18:19.420 --> 03:18:21.489
THANK YOU BYE AND BEFORE WE MOVE

03:18:21.556 --> 03:18:23.024
TO QUESTIONS OF MEMBERS THAT AT

03:18:23.091 --> 03:18:25.260
THE RISK OF OPENING UP. THE

03:18:25.326 --> 03:18:26.794
WHOLE PURPOSE FOR HAVING PANELS

03:18:26.861 --> 03:18:28.162
WHICH IS SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL FOR

03:18:28.229 --> 03:18:30.331
THIS COMMITTEE IS TO MAKE SURE

03:18:30.398 --> 03:18:31.633
THAT WE HAVE A FULL AND- FAIR

03:18:31.699 --> 03:18:34.702
AND OPEN CONVERSATION ABOUT

03:18:34.769 --> 03:18:37.372
THESE ISSUES SO THAT. WELL WE

03:18:37.438 --> 03:18:38.740
HAVE NO PRECONCEIVED NOTION AS

03:18:38.806 --> 03:18:41.175
TO HOW THIS. ENDS UP. WE WANT TO

03:18:41.242 --> 03:18:43.111
MAKE SURE WE DO HAVE THE

03:18:43.177 --> 03:18:44.979
INFORMATION THAT WE NEED TO HAVE

03:18:45.046 --> 03:18:46.748
ON THE RECORD SO THAT WE CAN

03:18:46.814 --> 03:18:47.415
MAKE AN APPROPRIATE DECISION. AT

03:18:47.482 --> 03:18:49.417
THE APPROPRIATE TIME SO HAVING

03:18:49.484 --> 03:18:50.618
SAID THAT I'M GOING TO START AT

03:18:50.685 --> 03:18:52.687
THE TOP. AND GIVE EACH ONE OF

03:18:52.754 --> 03:18:55.323
THE PANELISTS ON THIS PARTICULAR

03:18:55.390 --> 03:18:58.993
PANEL. TWO MINUTES- TO OFFER ANY

03:18:59.060 --> 03:19:00.495
POINT COUNTERPOINT TO WHAT'S

03:19:00.561 --> 03:19:02.030
BEEN SAID BY ANY OF THEM
