SOMETHING RUN BY NINE PEOPLE-

00:32:15.066 --> 00:32:16.567
THAT'S A BIG MAJOR CHANGE IN

00:32:16.634 --> 00:32:18.703
THIS BILL ON ITS IN ITS TAX AND

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:20.371
I'VE LOOKED THROUGH ALL OF IT IT

00:32:20.438 --> 00:32:21.706
DOES NOT TELL YOU WHAT TAX

00:32:21.773 --> 00:32:23.641
INCREASES OR SET OF TAX

00:32:23.708 --> 00:32:26.644
INCREASES ARE GOING TO FIND THIS

00:32:26.711 --> 00:32:28.713
VERY VERY EXPENSIVE PROGRAM. IT

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:31.049
SHOULD BE HELD AND NOT REFERRED

00:32:31.115 --> 00:32:32.984

00:32:34.585 --> 00:32:36.721
THAT HAVE THIS INFIRMITY FOR

00:32:36.788 --> 00:32:38.256
FIVE PLUS YEARS THAT'S POINT ONE

00:32:38.323 --> 00:32:40.992
POINT TWO THIS BILL IS MY

00:32:41.059 --> 00:32:41.993
UNDERSTANDING SINGLE REFERRED TO

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:42.694
HEALTH COMMITTEE. ALL THE

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.796
RESPECT TO THE CHAIR THE HEALTH

00:32:44.862 --> 00:32:46.964
COMMITTEE IS HERE TODAY- SITTING

00:32:47.031 --> 00:32:49.033
FOR ABSENT MEMBER- I KNOW THE

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:50.134
HEALTH CARE COMMITTEE THE HEALTH

00:32:50.201 --> 00:32:51.903
COMMITTEE IS QUITE COMPETENT TO

00:32:51.969 --> 00:32:53.338
REVIEW. THE HEALTH PROVISIONS OF

00:32:53.404 --> 00:32:54.706
THIS THIS BILL BUT THIS BILL

00:32:54.772 --> 00:32:56.174
SHOULD BE DOUBLE REFER TO READ

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:59.010
AND TAX AT A MINIMUM. IF NOT

00:32:59.077 --> 00:32:59.944
ALSO REFERRED TO BUSINESS

00:33:00.011 --> 00:33:01.412
PROFESSIONS. CENTER WOULD PUT AN

00:33:01.479 --> 00:33:03.281
ENORMOUS NUMBER OF PEOPLE OUT OF

00:33:03.348 --> 00:33:05.783
WORK OR PUT THEM. TO WORK IN

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:06.884
VERY DIFFERENT MANNER THAN THEY

00:33:06.951 --> 00:33:08.686
WORK TODAY- SO THE SINGLE

00:33:08.753 --> 00:33:10.388
REFERRAL TO HEALTH I BELIEVE IS

00:33:10.455 --> 00:33:13.691
ALSO- INAPPROPRIATE ON POLICY

00:33:13.758 --> 00:33:15.326

00:33:15.393 --> 00:33:17.061
SHOULD GO TO BOTH HEALTH. AND

00:33:17.128 --> 00:33:18.730
REVAN TAX. BECAUSE THERE'S NO

00:33:18.796 --> 00:33:20.932

00:33:20.998 --> 00:33:22.133
THIS THAT THIS BILL PROPORCIONAN

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:24.068
WHICH- WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT

00:33:24.135 --> 00:33:26.304
CHANGES IN THE WAY. THE STATE

00:33:26.371 --> 00:33:28.206
COLLECTS REVENUE FROM CITIZENS.

00:33:28.272 --> 00:33:30.575
IMPOSSIBLE AND WE ALL KNOW THAT.

00:33:30.641 --> 00:33:32.910
WITH LET'S NOT MAKE IT. ANY

00:33:32.977 --> 00:33:34.645
THERE'S NO DEBATE ABOUT THAT.

00:33:34.712 --> 00:33:37.782
THIS BILL HOWEVER IT IS GOING TO

00:33:37.849 --> 00:33:40.184
BE FUNDED. WILL POP BAND AND

00:33:40.251 --> 00:33:42.086
RESTRUCTURE. THE STATE'S REVENUE

00:33:42.153 --> 00:33:45.022
AND TAXATION FROM IT IT HAS PROP

00:33:45.089 --> 00:33:46.224

ARE BIG BIG CHANGES AND THEY

00:33:53.331 --> 00:33:55.366

THAT SUBJECT MATTER NOT A SINGLE

00:34:01.839 --> 00:34:04.742
COMMITTEE. IT ALSO HAS THE

00:34:04.809 --> 00:34:06.878
PROBLEM WHERE IT DOESN'T

00:36:08.666 --> 00:36:10.167
PROPERLY THROUGH EDT BUT WE'RE

00:36:10.234 --> 00:36:11.903
GONNA MAKE ALL OF THAT A STATE

00:36:11.969 --> 00:36:14.939
AGENCY AND IT'S GOING TO CONTROL

00:36:15.006 --> 00:36:15.606
EVERY ASPECT OF YOUR HEALTH CARE

00:36:15.673 --> 00:36:17.408
BEFORE WE CAN SAY HEY WE THAT'S

00:36:17.475 --> 00:36:19.310
A GOOD IDEA WE WANT TO DO THAT.

00:36:19.377 --> 00:36:21.145
WE AT LEAST NEED TO KNOW AND WE

00:36:21.212 --> 00:36:23.281
HAVE A DUTY TO FIND OUT AND HAVE

00:36:23.347 --> 00:36:25.783
THE L. A- FIND OUT HOW MUCH IT'S

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:26.851
GONNA COST. THAT'S A MINIMUM. I

00:36:26.918 --> 00:36:28.486
FURTHER MOVED THAT THIS BILL BE

00:36:28.553 --> 00:36:30.655
A. B. FOURTEEN HUNDRED BE HELD

00:36:30.721 --> 00:36:31.556
IN THIS COMMITTEE UNTIL WE

RECEIVE. THE COST IMPACT REPORT

00:36:34.225 --> 00:36:36.460
BACK FROM THE L. L. I THINK

00:36:36.527 --> 00:36:37.328
THAT'S A VERY REASONABLE THING

00:36:37.395 --> 00:36:38.896
TO DO I THINK. TAKING THAT

00:36:38.963 --> 00:36:40.765
COURSE OF ACTION RATHER THAN A

00:36:40.831 --> 00:36:41.632
SINGLE REFER TO HEALTH. SINGLE

00:36:41.699 --> 00:36:43.701
REFERRAL TO HEALTH CARE. WILL

00:36:43.768 --> 00:36:44.335
GIVE US THE INFORMATION THAT WE

00:36:44.402 --> 00:36:46.070
NEED SO WE CAN LOOK OUR

00:36:46.137 --> 00:36:47.171
CONSTITUENTS IN THE EYE. AND

00:36:47.238 --> 00:36:48.406
TELL THEM THAT WE ARE BEING

00:36:48.472 --> 00:36:50.641
RESPONSIBLE AS LEGISLATORS. SO

00:36:50.708 --> 00:37:00.918
THAT IS MY MOTION. WHAT WERE.

00:37:00.985 --> 00:37:03.788
LET ME THERE THERE IS A MOTION

00:37:03.854 --> 00:37:10.294
ON THE TABLE- UNDER JOINT RULE

00:37:10.361 --> 00:37:11.462
THIRTY SEVEN POINT ONE A LETTER

00:37:11.529 --> 00:37:13.230
CAN BE SUBMITTED RULES

00:37:13.297 --> 00:37:15.466
REQUESTING SUCH A STUDY. I

00:37:15.533 --> 00:37:17.802
ACTUALLY THINK THE TIME WILL BE

00:37:17.868 --> 00:37:21.772
RIPE. TO MAKE SUCH A REQUEST.

00:37:21.839 --> 00:37:23.674
ONE OF THE ISSUES HERE IS THAT

00:37:23.741 --> 00:37:25.810
UNDER LEGISLATION PASSED IN

00:37:25.876 --> 00:37:28.279
TWENTY NINETEEN. ARE SENATE

CALIFORNIA COMMISSION WHICH HAS

BEEN DOING EXAMINATIONS OF THE

00:37:39.423 --> 00:37:40.524
GENERAL TOPIC OF HEALTH CARE.

00:37:40.591 --> 00:37:42.493

ASSESSMENT OF FINANCING ISSUES

00:37:46.831 --> 00:37:49.066
ASSOCIATED WITH BROAD AND HEALTH

00:37:49.133 --> 00:37:53.671
CARE COVERAGE. THE ISSUE I HAVE

00:37:53.738 --> 00:37:55.506
IS IT IS THE HEALTH COMMITTEE

00:37:55.573 --> 00:37:58.042
WHICH IN APRIL LAST YEAR-

00:37:58.109 --> 00:37:59.677
REACHED OUT TO THE APPROPRIATE

00:37:59.744 --> 00:38:01.646
STATE AGENCY OF PROGRAM REVIEW

00:38:01.712 --> 00:38:03.714
TO GET A HIGH LEVEL INITIAL VIEW

00:38:03.781 --> 00:38:05.716
OF AB FOURTEEN HUNDRED. WHICH

00:38:05.783 --> 00:38:07.718
WAS BECAUSE OF OUR CHAIR HE

00:38:07.785 --> 00:38:10.054
SOUGHT THAT OUT. HE HAS BEEN

00:38:10.121 --> 00:38:12.923
SERVING ON THIS PANEL WHICH IS

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:14.792
CLOSING IN ON AN UPDATED

00:38:14.859 --> 00:38:16.894
EVALUATION. WHEN THAT REPORT

00:38:16.961 --> 00:38:18.629
COMES OUT IT WILL ACTUALLY

00:38:18.696 --> 00:38:20.698
POSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY. WITH

00:38:20.765 --> 00:38:22.767
RESPECT TO THIS BILL OR ANY

00:38:22.833 --> 00:38:25.136
SIMILAR BILL BECAUSE THE

00:38:25.202 --> 00:38:26.203
COMMISSION'S FOCUS ON BROADER

00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:29.373
ISSUES. WHAT IS KNOWN. AND WHAT

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:31.409
IS NOT KNOWN THAT WE MIGHT

00:38:31.475 --> 00:38:33.544
ELUCIDATE BY FURTHER STUDY I

00:38:33.611 --> 00:38:35.312
SORT OF THINK THE TIME TO ASK

00:38:35.379 --> 00:38:37.782
THE L. A. O. TO WEIGH IN IS WHEN

00:38:37.848 --> 00:38:39.316
WE'VE HAD AN EVALUATION OF

00:38:39.383 --> 00:38:41.786
SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THAT REMAIN

00:38:41.852 --> 00:38:45.389
OPEN. AFTER THIS LONG PROCESS.

00:38:45.456 --> 00:38:48.793
OF SO I ACTUALLY. PERSONALLY DO

00:38:48.859 --> 00:38:49.760
NOT FAVOR REFERRAL OTHER

00:38:49.827 --> 00:38:51.629
COMMITTEE AT THIS TIME. UNDER

00:38:51.696 --> 00:38:53.297

THEM HAVE SAID WE DON'T ACTUALLY

00:39:01.072 --> 00:39:09.180
NEED TO SEE IT. ON. I ALSO THINK

00:39:09.246 --> 00:39:12.316
THAT ON BEHALF OF THE ASSEMBLY.

00:39:12.383 --> 00:39:15.720
THERE IS A ONE LEGISLATOR. WHO

00:39:15.786 --> 00:39:17.488
HAS THE TIME AND THE INTEREST

00:39:17.555 --> 00:39:19.190
AND HAS DISPLAYED THE TIME OF

00:39:19.256 --> 00:39:20.858
THE AT FIRST AND THAT'S THE

00:39:20.925 --> 00:39:22.359

THIS WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH

00:39:45.783 --> 00:39:47.718
THE- WORK OF THE ASSEMBLY

00:39:47.785 --> 00:39:50.454

THAT SAYS TO BE ABLE TO MOVE

00:42:29.546 --> 00:42:31.615
PIECE OF LEGISLATION FORWARD ON

ABOUT THROUGHOUT THE PIECE OF

LEGISLATION- WHY WHY AREN'T WE

00:42:51.502 --> 00:42:53.737
SENDING THAT TO- TAX AND REV

00:42:53.804 --> 00:42:57.107
ALSO AT THIS TIME. IS THERE-

00:42:57.174 --> 00:42:58.575
SOME INFORMATION THAT WE SHOULD

00:42:58.642 --> 00:43:02.279

00:44:14.084 --> 00:44:16.053
I THINK THAT IS A RIPE SUBJECT

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:16.653
FOR THE HEALTH COMMITTEE TO

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:18.722
BRING TO THE FULL BODY TO WALK

00:44:18.789 --> 00:44:20.791
TO THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THAT IT

00:44:20.858 --> 00:44:23.227
WILL BUILD UPON THE STUDY THAT

00:44:23.293 --> 00:44:24.428
ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD ALREADY

00:44:24.495 --> 00:44:27.531
INITIATED- IN APRIL OF LAST YEAR

FURTHER EXAMINATION AND THAT

00:44:30.501 --> 00:44:32.870

CLEAR THAT. I HEARD THAT THERE

00:44:41.445 --> 00:44:43.480
IS GOING TO BE AN ACA THAT WOULD

00:44:43.547 --> 00:44:45.082
BE THE A MECHANISM TO- HAVE THE

00:44:45.149 --> 00:44:46.116
DISCUSSION AROUND THE REVENUE

00:44:46.183 --> 00:44:47.484
STREAM OF THIS THIS PROGRAM

MISTER CHAIR- AND TO MY CALL

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:07.905
ALMOST QUESTION ABOUT THE FUND

00:45:07.971 --> 00:45:08.872
SOURCE WHICH ACTUALLY WHAT I

00:45:08.939 --> 00:45:10.674
WANT TO TALK. ABOUT TO. FOR JUST

00:45:10.741 --> 00:45:12.209
A BRIEF MOMENT- IN THAT ACA. IT

00:45:12.276 --> 00:45:13.377
EXPLICITLY STATES THAT THIS MAY

00:45:13.444 --> 00:45:15.012
WOULDN'T AN EXCISE TAX. THE

00:45:15.079 --> 00:45:15.679
PAYROLL. PERSONAL IN HEALTHCARE

00:45:15.746 --> 00:45:18.248
TAX. AND ONE OF THE PARTS OF IN

00:45:18.315 --> 00:45:19.883
MIND. IS THAT THE MEASURE WOULD

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:21.518
AUTHORIZE THE LEGISLATURE PART

00:45:21.585 --> 00:45:23.420
AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS DETERMINED

00:45:23.487 --> 00:45:24.621
IN SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS TO FUND

00:45:24.688 --> 00:45:27.991
THESE PURPOSES TO INCREASE ANY.

00:45:28.058 --> 00:45:31.328
OR ALL TAXES. BY STATUTE PASSED

00:45:31.395 --> 00:45:33.864
WITH A SIMPLE MAJORITY. WHAT

00:45:33.931 --> 00:45:36.700
WE'RE SAYING IS. THE ROUGH COSTS

00:45:36.767 --> 00:45:39.136
THAT IMPRINT IS ONE HUNDRED AND

00:45:39.203 --> 00:45:40.904
SIXTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS.

00:45:40.971 --> 00:45:42.573
THAT'S THE NUMBER THAT WE'RE

00:45:42.639 --> 00:45:43.674
HERE THAT'S WHAT THESE TAXES-

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:45.576
TRIED TO WERE ALREADY ADMITTED

00:45:45.642 --> 00:45:48.979
IN THIS THAT WE DON'T THINK IT'S

00:45:49.046 --> 00:45:50.180
GOING TO BE ENOUGH MONEY. SO

00:45:50.247 --> 00:45:51.281
GOING TO HAVE TO COME BACK AND

00:45:51.348 --> 00:45:53.450
RAISE TAXES AGAIN. ONCE AGAIN

00:45:53.517 --> 00:45:55.853
BREAKING FROM THE PRACTICE THAT

00:45:55.919 --> 00:45:57.721
THAT TWO THIRDS VOTE. IF THIS

00:45:57.788 --> 00:46:00.023
GOES THROUGH IF THIS ACA. DOES

00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:02.292
NOT GET FIXED THIS FUNDING

00:46:02.359 --> 00:46:03.227
SOURCE DOES NOT GET SHAKEN OUT

00:46:03.293 --> 00:46:05.996
PROPERLY. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A

00:46:06.063 --> 00:46:07.931
SIMPLE MAJORITY. WHO HAS THE

00:46:07.998 --> 00:46:09.833
ABILITY TO RAISE TAXES ON EVERY

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:11.668
ASPECT OF OUR LIVES. WITH A

00:46:11.735 --> 00:46:13.637
SIMPLE MAJORITY VOTE. I THINK

00:46:13.704 --> 00:46:15.739
THAT IS DEVASTATING. I THINK

00:46:15.806 --> 00:46:17.107
THAT IS INCREDIBLY

00:46:17.174 --> 00:46:19.176
UNCONSTITUTIONAL. AND I THINK

00:46:19.243 --> 00:46:20.644
IT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD TAKE

00:46:20.711 --> 00:46:23.247
INCREDIBLY SERIOUS. WE'RE NOT

00:46:23.313 --> 00:46:26.483
JUST ASKING A TAX ON THE RICH.

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:28.418
MIKE IN THE IN THE LANGUAGE THAT

00:46:28.485 --> 00:46:29.887
TALKS ABOUT ANYBODY MAKING OVER

00:46:29.953 --> 00:46:31.588
FORTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS. IS

00:46:31.655 --> 00:46:34.424
GONNA GET A TAX. IT GOES UP FROM

00:46:34.491 --> 00:46:37.094
THERE. THAT IS LOW INCOME MIDDLE

00:46:37.161 --> 00:46:38.795
INCOME FOLKS IN MY DISTRICT THE

00:46:38.862 --> 00:46:40.797
MEN AND WOMEN THAT COLLECTIVELY

00:46:40.864 --> 00:46:42.833
BARGAIN WITH THEIR LABOR GROUPS

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:44.468
AND HAVE HEALTH CARE PLANS. WE

00:46:44.535 --> 00:46:46.904
THROW IT OUT. IT WAS PUT

00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:48.172
SOMETHING NEW IN THEIR PLACE.

00:46:48.238 --> 00:46:50.641
COLLEAGUES ARM. OUR HEALTHCARE

00:46:50.707 --> 00:46:52.809
SYSTEM IS BROKEN WE ALL THE

00:46:52.876 --> 00:46:53.810
KNOWLEDGE THAT IT NEEDS TO BE

00:46:53.877 --> 00:46:56.747
FIXED. BUT TO JAM OF THIS DOWN

00:46:56.813 --> 00:46:59.116
THIS BODIES GROW. WITH VERY

00:46:59.183 --> 00:47:02.452
LITTLE. INPUT AND THE FACT THAT

00:47:02.519 --> 00:47:03.587
THERE'S ALREADY A CA IMPRINT BUT

00:47:03.654 --> 00:47:04.855
WE'RE STILL ONLY TALKING ABOUT

00:47:04.922 --> 00:47:06.156
SINGLE REFERRED TO UNDERSTAND

00:47:06.223 --> 00:47:07.925
CODE I GET ALL OF THAT. BUT WE

00:47:07.991 --> 00:47:09.960
HAVE THE LARGEST TAX IN TH

00:47:10.027 --> 00:47:12.029
COUNTRY'S HISTORY. STARING US IN

00:47:12.095 --> 00:47:15.599
THE FACE. AND WE'RE NOT JUST IN

00:47:15.666 --> 00:47:18.602
A DRIVEN TAX. THANK YOU MISTER

00:47:18.669 --> 00:47:24.374
FOR ARM. I GUESS THE ISSUE I

00:47:24.441 --> 00:47:32.950
WOULD SAY. OUR. THE ONLY BODY.

00:47:33.016 --> 00:47:33.617
THAT HAS CONSTITUTIONAL STANDING

00:47:33.684 --> 00:47:35.619
REALLY TO GRAPPLE WITH ISSUES OF

00:47:35.686 --> 00:47:37.621
THIS CHARACTER IS A LEGISLATIVE

00:47:37.688 --> 00:47:42.759
BODY. I AM STRONGLY IN FAVOR. OF

00:47:42.826 --> 00:47:43.994
KEEPING THIS CONVERSATION

00:47:44.061 --> 00:47:46.697
ANALYSTS SAY BODY. IT'S NOT GOOD

00:47:46.763 --> 00:47:48.966
ENOUGH TO LET THE EXECUTIVE

00:47:49.032 --> 00:47:50.400
BRANCH RUN A CONVERSATION. AT

00:47:50.467 --> 00:47:51.802
THE END WHEN A LAWMAKER ASKED

00:47:51.868 --> 00:47:54.671
FOR ADVICE THEY SAY WE CAN'T

00:47:54.738 --> 00:47:57.975
GIVE IT TO YOU. WE HAVEN'T GOT A

00:47:58.041 --> 00:47:58.909
SIGN OFF FROM THE GOVERNOR. THAT

00:47:58.976 --> 00:48:00.844
IS AN AFFRONT TO THE DIGNITY OF

00:48:00.911 --> 00:48:02.179
THIS INSTITUTION. WE HAVE A

00:48:02.246 --> 00:48:08.085
CHAIRMAN. WHO HAS A RECORD OF A

00:48:08.151 --> 00:48:09.653
COMFY MIGHTY THINGS TO A BI

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:11.255
PARTISAN EFFORT THAT IS FACT

00:48:11.321 --> 00:48:12.522
BASED ON SPEAKING OUT MEDICAL

00:48:12.589 --> 00:48:14.625
MARIJUANA MR LACKEY MR BONTA

00:48:14.691 --> 00:48:15.726
MYSELF BECAUSE A REGISTERED

SAWYER REQUIREMENTS FOR LARA. WE

00:48:21.365 --> 00:48:24.501
HAVE SIX MONTHS I THINK BEFORE

00:48:24.568 --> 00:48:26.303
THE SENATE REALLY ENGAGES ON

00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:32.709
THIS BILL. SO I FEEL IT IS TIME

00:48:32.776 --> 00:48:35.579
. FOR US TO PULL THIS ISSUE INTO

00:48:35.646 --> 00:48:37.848
OUR LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WHICH TO

WHOEVER THEY WANT AS A PART OF

00:48:44.821 --> 00:48:46.790
JOINT HEARING. BUT I THINK THERE

00:48:46.857 --> 00:48:49.459
IS THERE IS A MEMBER IN THIS

00:48:49.526 --> 00:48:51.995
