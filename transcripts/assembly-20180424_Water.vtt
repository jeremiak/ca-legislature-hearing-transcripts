00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:10.034 region:rollup2
COULD BE COMPLETELY RUINED BY

00:46:08.065 --> 00:46:11.535 region:rollup2
THE APPROACH OF A FEW TO TO

00:46:10.034 --> 00:46:12.903 region:rollup2
BENEFIT.

00:46:11.535 --> 00:46:14.405 region:rollup2
TWO THIRDS OF THE POPULATION

00:46:12.903 --> 00:46:16.207 region:rollup2
STATE BUT DAMAGE THE ECONOMY OF

00:46:14.405 --> 00:46:18.509 region:rollup2
A THIRD WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT

00:46:16.207 --> 00:46:21.012 region:rollup2
ALSO. IS THAT THIS ISN'T ABOUT

00:46:18.509 --> 00:46:22.647 region:rollup2
WATER. SPECIFIC THIS IS ABOUT

00:46:21.012 --> 00:46:24.715 region:rollup2
ENDANGERED SPECIES ALSO.

00:46:22.647 --> 00:46:26.450 region:rollup2
THERE'S THERE'S FISH AND FAUNA

00:46:24.715 --> 00:46:28.319 region:rollup2
THAT ARE AFFECTED BY THIS

00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:30.154 region:rollup2
DECISION MAKING PROCESS.

00:46:28.319 --> 00:46:31.689 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE DIDN'T BUILD THIS

00:46:30.154 --> 00:46:31.922 region:rollup2
PROJECT IN IN.

00:46:31.689 --> 00:46:34.058 region:rollup2
IN THE.

00:46:31.922 --> 00:46:37.028 region:rollup2
.

00:46:34.058 --> 00:46:39.664 region:rollup2
A COURT OF.

00:46:37.028 --> 00:46:41.666 region:rollup2
AREA OF WHERE IT'S BUILT ARE IN

00:46:39.664 --> 00:46:43.434 region:rollup2
NEAR TRACY CALIFORNIA. A TO

00:46:41.666 --> 00:46:44.902 region:rollup2
PROVIDE A COLD THE SACK OF

00:46:43.434 --> 00:46:46.537 region:rollup2
PULLING WATER IN FROM THE DELTA

00:46:44.902 --> 00:46:48.939 region:rollup2
REVERSING THE FLOW OF THE DELTA

00:46:46.537 --> 00:46:50.608 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE WATER TO. OF SOUTHERN

00:46:48.939 --> 00:46:52.643 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA OF SO WHAT WE'RE

00:46:50.608 --> 00:46:54.445 region:rollup2
SAYING IS THAT THERE MAY BE MORE

00:46:52.643 --> 00:46:55.846 region:rollup2
REASONABLE APPROACHES BUT WE

00:46:54.445 --> 00:46:57.481 region:rollup2
NEED A NON BIASED LOOK.

00:46:55.846 --> 00:46:59.083 region:rollup2
AGAIN ALL OF THE OPPONENTS ARE

00:46:57.481 --> 00:47:01.018 region:rollup2
BENEFACTORS.

00:46:59.083 --> 00:47:02.653 region:rollup2
TO THIS PROJECT

00:47:01.018 --> 00:47:04.422 region:rollup2
AND SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS

00:47:02.653 --> 00:47:06.323 region:rollup2
A MORE FAIR BALANCED.

00:47:04.422 --> 00:47:08.793 region:rollup2
UNBIASED APPROACH THAT TAKING

00:47:06.323 --> 00:47:10.528 region:rollup2
OTHER FACTORS INTO CONSIDERATION

00:47:08.793 --> 00:47:11.929 region:rollup2
THIS ONCE WAS THE BT CP

00:47:10.528 --> 00:47:13.531 region:rollup2
WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN HUNDREDS

00:47:11.929 --> 00:47:14.899 region:rollup2
OF THOUSANDS OF ACRES HUNDREDS

00:47:13.531 --> 00:47:17.301 region:rollup2
OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND MAKERS

00:47:14.899 --> 00:47:18.436 region:rollup2
OF MITIGATION FOR CONSERVATION.

00:47:17.301 --> 00:47:19.937 region:rollup2
TO ENHANCE IN IN THE.

00:47:18.436 --> 00:47:20.738 region:rollup2
DELTA

00:47:19.937 --> 00:47:22.440 region:rollup2
THAT'S BEEN THROWN BY THE

00:47:20.738 --> 00:47:24.442 region:rollup2
WAYSIDE FIRST IT WAS ABOUT A

00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:25.509 region:rollup2
MAKING THE DELTA BETTER.

00:47:24.442 --> 00:47:27.778 region:rollup2
NOT JUST BECOME ABOUT WATER

00:47:25.509 --> 00:47:29.146 region:rollup2
WHO AND.

00:47:27.778 --> 00:47:30.214 region:rollup2
WE ARE SAYING THAT SPECIES ARE

00:47:29.146 --> 00:47:31.749 region:rollup2
INVOLVED IN AN ECONOMY IS

00:47:30.214 --> 00:47:33.250 region:rollup2
INVOLVED.

00:47:31.749 --> 00:47:34.985 region:rollup2
DRINKING WATER IN OUR AREAS

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:37.388 region:rollup2
INVOLVED A LOT OF THOSE FACTORS

00:47:34.985 --> 00:47:40.958 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IN A FAIR

00:47:37.388 --> 00:47:42.026 region:rollup2
AND REASONABLE FASHION.

00:47:40.958 --> 00:47:44.261 region:rollup2
OKAY I THINK OF THOSE A

00:47:42.026 --> 00:47:45.896 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE OF OPINION NOW FROM.

00:47:44.261 --> 00:47:47.598 region:rollup2
MY OPINION.

00:47:45.896 --> 00:47:51.836 region:rollup2
IT IS A VERY.

00:47:47.598 --> 00:47:53.571 region:rollup2
AND UNBALANCED.

00:47:51.836 --> 00:47:57.775 region:rollup2
MAKE UP AND DOWN A TRYING TO

00:47:53.571 --> 00:47:57.775 region:rollup2
CREATE. A DELAY SIGN THE

00:47:57.842 --> 00:48:02.880 region:rollup2
IDEA PROPOSED A DATA PROTECTION

00:48:01.178 --> 00:48:04.982 region:rollup2
THE OF COMMISSION AND WHEN YOU

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:06.817 region:rollup2
SPEAK ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL

00:48:04.982 --> 00:48:09.754 region:rollup2
ISSUES AND OFFICIIS YOU

00:48:06.817 --> 00:48:10.688 region:rollup2
ATTENDING JETTA. ó AND ONE

00:48:09.754 --> 00:48:11.489 region:rollup2
ISSUES.

00:48:10.688 --> 00:48:13.324 region:rollup2
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT TELL ABOUT

00:48:11.489 --> 00:48:16.026 region:rollup2
THE HUMAN RIGHTS.

00:48:13.324 --> 00:48:19.096 region:rollup2
WITH A NO WATER INSTANT A SEVEN

00:48:16.026 --> 00:48:21.866 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. A WE WISH TO HUMAN.

00:48:19.096 --> 00:48:25.136 region:rollup2
OUR LIFE SO OR FOR.

00:48:21.866 --> 00:48:27.905 region:rollup2
A ENDANGERED SPECIES. ó AND DO

00:48:25.136 --> 00:48:30.975 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IF OUR WATER FLOWS TOWN

00:48:27.905 --> 00:48:31.742 region:rollup2
VIA IS SEE ENDANGERED SPECIES OF

00:48:30.975 --> 00:48:33.878 region:rollup2
FISH USE THAT YOU'RE TALKING

00:48:31.742 --> 00:48:35.880 region:rollup2
ABOUT THOUGH. IN ORDER WOULD BE

00:48:33.878 --> 00:48:38.215 region:rollup2
VIRTUALLY YA COME HOME FREELY

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:40.184 region:rollup2
AFFECTED I THINK THAT HAS BEEN

00:48:38.215 --> 00:48:42.153 region:rollup2
ALL CONSIDER AT THE END UP AND

00:48:40.184 --> 00:48:44.488 region:rollup2
MOST OF PROPOSED AND HAS BEEN. A

00:48:42.153 --> 00:48:45.823 region:rollup2
SUBMITTED AND THAT WORKED OUT

00:48:44.488 --> 00:48:48.893 region:rollup2
THE WIKIPEDIA OR REGIONAL

00:48:45.823 --> 00:48:49.360 region:rollup2
CONTESTS TO SHIP COMES OF THAT'S

00:48:48.893 --> 00:48:50.728 region:rollup2
MY OPINION.

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:52.797 region:rollup2
AND YOU SERVE VERY MUCH ENTITLED

00:48:50.728 --> 00:48:55.299 region:rollup2
TO THAT I'VE LIVED IN THE DELTA

00:48:52.797 --> 00:48:57.601 region:rollup2
REGION FOR TWENTY THREE YEARS.

00:48:55.299 --> 00:48:59.837 region:rollup2
AND UNDERSTAND THE IMPACTS THAT

00:48:57.601 --> 00:49:02.339 region:rollup2
WE DO HAVE DROUGHT AND WATER

00:48:59.837 --> 00:49:04.141 region:rollup2
CANNOT FLOW IN ANY PROJECT

00:49:02.339 --> 00:49:05.576 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF LOW FLOWS.

00:49:04.141 --> 00:49:06.844 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THERE'S A PROTECTION

00:49:05.576 --> 00:49:08.579 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED TO TAKE ABOUT YOUR

00:49:06.844 --> 00:49:09.280 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS ALSO THAT IF WATER

00:49:08.579 --> 00:49:11.182 region:rollup2
IS NOT FLOWING THROUGH THIS

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:11.549 region:rollup2
PROJECT. THAT THAT THAT THAT WE

00:49:11.182 --> 00:49:12.950 region:rollup2
FEEL THAT THIS.

00:49:11.549 --> 00:49:14.418 region:rollup2
.

00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:16.620 region:rollup2
S. COUNCILS TRYING TO PROMOTE.

00:49:14.418 --> 00:49:17.421 region:rollup2
THAT YOUR RATES ARE GOING TO GO

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:18.422 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE THROUGH THE SKY AND

00:49:17.421 --> 00:49:20.858 region:rollup2
THE TAXPAYERS ARE GOING TO BE

00:49:18.422 --> 00:49:22.993 region:rollup2
AFFECTED DRAMATICALLY. IF WE

00:49:20.858 --> 00:49:25.896 region:rollup2
HAVE A DECADE LOUD RHODEN A.

00:49:22.993 --> 00:49:27.565 region:rollup2
DECADE LONG DROUGHT A.

00:49:25.896 --> 00:49:29.600 region:rollup2
THAT PROJECT IS IS NOT

00:49:27.565 --> 00:49:32.203 region:rollup2
NONEXISTENT OR THEY'LL BE

00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:33.971 region:rollup2
EFFORTS TO A. TAKE.

00:49:32.203 --> 00:49:35.706 region:rollup2
A SPECIES INSTEAD OF BANQUET

00:49:33.971 --> 00:49:37.508 region:rollup2
SPEECH OF FEET PEOPLE AND

00:49:35.706 --> 00:49:39.310 region:rollup2
PROFITS BEFORE SPECIES AND

00:49:37.508 --> 00:49:41.078 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT I'M AFRAID OF ALSO.

00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:43.280 region:rollup2
A THIS THIS PROJECT DOES IT.

00:49:41.078 --> 00:49:44.215 region:rollup2
ALLOW FOR ONE ADDITIONAL DROP OF

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:46.584 region:rollup2
WATER IT CIRCUMVENTS THE

00:49:44.215 --> 00:49:48.285 region:rollup2
PLUMBING ON THE DELTA INCREASES

00:49:46.584 --> 00:49:50.855 region:rollup2
THE SALINITY LEVELS COMING UP

00:49:48.285 --> 00:49:52.957 region:rollup2
FORWARD. AND SO I I I BEG TO

00:49:50.855 --> 00:49:53.791 region:rollup2
DIFFER AND AGAIN I APPRECIATE

00:49:52.957 --> 00:49:56.260 region:rollup2
YOUR OPINION.

00:49:53.791 --> 00:49:58.429 region:rollup2
AND WE WILL HAVE THAT NORTH

00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:59.263 region:rollup2
SOUTH KIND OF A.

00:49:58.429 --> 00:50:01.465 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THINGS BUT THE.

00:49:59.263 --> 00:50:03.968 region:rollup2
AGAIN.

00:50:01.465 --> 00:50:05.736 region:rollup2
I AM AFRAID OF WHAT THIS PROJECT

00:50:03.968 --> 00:50:08.706 region:rollup2
IN THIS COUNCIL HAS OF THE

00:50:05.736 --> 00:50:11.175 region:rollup2
APPROACH TO DUE. TO DAMAGE MY

00:50:08.706 --> 00:50:13.110 region:rollup2
FARMERS MY RECREATION MY

00:50:11.175 --> 00:50:13.711 region:rollup2
DRINKING WATER YOU'RE WORRIED

00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:16.447 region:rollup2
ABOUT YOUR DRINKING WATER. SO

00:50:13.711 --> 00:50:19.016 region:rollup2
MY.

00:50:16.447 --> 00:50:21.185 region:rollup2
SO MY AND WE HAVE MANY PEOPLE

00:50:19.016 --> 00:50:23.320 region:rollup2
THAT ARE RELIANT ON THAT. TOOK

00:50:21.185 --> 00:50:25.356 region:rollup2
TO LIVE AND SO.

00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:26.590 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THE INITIAL PROJECT WAS

00:50:25.356 --> 00:50:28.559 region:rollup2
BUILT.

00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:30.261 region:rollup2
IT DIDN'T WORK.

00:50:28.559 --> 00:50:32.696 region:rollup2
IT IS A IT'S AN AFFECT ON THE

00:50:30.261 --> 00:50:34.298 region:rollup2
SPECIES OF THE OF THE DELTA.

00:50:32.696 --> 00:50:35.466 region:rollup2
AND WE THINK THERE MIGHT BE SOME

00:50:34.298 --> 00:50:37.201 region:rollup2
MORE REASONABLE APPROACHES THAT

00:50:35.466 --> 00:50:39.770 region:rollup2
COULD BE TAKEN.

00:50:37.201 --> 00:50:41.772 region:rollup2
A BEFORE WE ARE HAVE A PROJECT

00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:43.140 region:rollup2
THAT WILL SIPHON OFF.

00:50:41.772 --> 00:50:44.642 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS OF CUBIC FEET PER

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:45.943 region:rollup2
MINUTE OF WATER.

00:50:44.642 --> 00:50:48.579 region:rollup2
I THAT WOULD NORMALLY GIVE A

00:50:45.943 --> 00:50:50.014 region:rollup2
FLUSH TO THE CALIFORNIA DELTA.

00:50:48.579 --> 00:50:52.283 region:rollup2
AND KEEP THE SALINITY LEVELS

00:50:50.014 --> 00:50:55.219 region:rollup2
DOWN. OF WHERE THEY REMAIN NOW

00:50:52.283 --> 00:50:57.221 region:rollup2
AND NO CONSIDERATION OF OF OF

00:50:55.219 --> 00:50:58.322 region:rollup2
SEA LEVEL RISES BEEN IN IN MY

00:50:57.221 --> 00:51:00.024 region:rollup2
OPINION HAS BEEN FACTORED IN

00:50:58.322 --> 00:51:01.692 region:rollup2
ALSO ON HOW THIS CAN AFFECT THE

00:51:00.024 --> 00:51:04.194 region:rollup2
SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES IN MY

00:51:01.692 --> 00:51:05.596 region:rollup2
AREA SO AGAIN. MARK TWAIN SAID.

00:51:04.194 --> 00:51:08.599 region:rollup2
IT WHISKEYS FOR DRINKING WATERS

00:51:05.596 --> 00:51:10.801 region:rollup2
HER FIGHT.

00:51:08.599 --> 00:51:14.838 region:rollup2
QUESTION FROM A SUMMER MATHIS.

00:51:10.801 --> 00:51:15.439 region:rollup2
I'M.

00:51:14.838 --> 00:51:16.373 region:rollup2
QUIT QUITE FRANKLY I THINK WE

00:51:15.439 --> 00:51:18.042 region:rollup2
NEEDED.

00:51:16.373 --> 00:51:19.443 region:rollup2
STAR LOOKING OUTSIDE OF THE BOX

00:51:18.042 --> 00:51:22.046 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN SO FOCUSED ON

00:51:19.443 --> 00:51:23.914 region:rollup2
THE DELTA. BEING THE ONLY SOURCE

00:51:22.046 --> 00:51:26.050 region:rollup2
TO GET WATER SOUTH.

00:51:23.914 --> 00:51:27.685 region:rollup2
THEY I REALLY WISH WE DON'T

00:51:26.050 --> 00:51:29.987 region:rollup2
TAKE A STEP BACK AND LOOK AT

00:51:27.685 --> 00:51:31.221 region:rollup2
OTHER OPTIONS ON.

00:51:29.987 --> 00:51:33.991 region:rollup2
DO YOU CELLS A HUGE OPTION.

00:51:31.221 --> 00:51:36.260 region:rollup2
.

00:51:33.991 --> 00:51:37.094 region:rollup2
QUITE FRANKLY THAT THE LAST FOUR

00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:37.294 region:rollup2
YEARS SINCE WE'VE ALL BEEN UP

00:51:37.094 --> 00:51:38.963 region:rollup2
HERE.

00:51:37.294 --> 00:51:41.098 region:rollup2
.

00:51:38.963 --> 00:51:42.866 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE PUSHING FOR

00:51:41.098 --> 00:51:44.768 region:rollup2
RENEWABLE ENERGY GOALS WERE

00:51:42.866 --> 00:51:47.237 region:rollup2
PUSHING FOR WATER GOALS.

00:51:44.768 --> 00:51:48.572 region:rollup2
ON THE OTHER STATE IN IN THIS IS

00:51:47.237 --> 00:51:49.707 region:rollup2
NOTHING ON YOU MISTER FREIGHTER.

00:51:48.572 --> 00:51:51.675 region:rollup2
THAT THE STATE'S LOOKING AT

00:51:49.707 --> 00:51:53.210 region:rollup2
SHUTTING DOWN DIABLO GRANDET.

00:51:51.675 --> 00:51:54.712 region:rollup2
OUR LAST NUCLEAR REACTOR

00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:56.080 region:rollup2
THEY'VE STATED OVER AND OVER

00:51:54.712 --> 00:51:58.248 region:rollup2
AGAIN THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO

00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:59.750 region:rollup2
DO DE SALLE.

00:51:58.248 --> 00:52:01.185 region:rollup2
JUST BY DOING AN INCREASE IN

00:51:59.750 --> 00:52:04.188 region:rollup2
THEIR INTAKE PIE.

00:52:01.185 --> 00:52:05.689 region:rollup2
AND WE ALL KNOW THE DELTA WATER.

00:52:04.188 --> 00:52:07.157 region:rollup2
ITS NEXT STOP WHERE GETS HELD IN

00:52:05.689 --> 00:52:09.460 region:rollup2
THE STATE WATER PROJECTS IS THE

00:52:07.157 --> 00:52:10.894 region:rollup2
SOUND THOSE THREADS WAR.

00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:12.663 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO POP

00:52:10.894 --> 00:52:14.298 region:rollup2
DESALINATED WATER INTO THE ST

00:52:12.663 --> 00:52:16.433 region:rollup2
LOUIS RESERVOIR AND REFILL IT ON

00:52:14.298 --> 00:52:17.468 region:rollup2
A CONTINUAL BASIS.

00:52:16.433 --> 00:52:18.535 region:rollup2
STATING THIS TODAY BECAUSE I

00:52:17.468 --> 00:52:19.169 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK THERE'S ENOUGH

00:52:18.535 --> 00:52:20.771 region:rollup2
PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT REAL LIFE

00:52:19.169 --> 00:52:22.706 region:rollup2
THIS.

00:52:20.771 --> 00:52:24.708 region:rollup2
AND QUITE FRANKLY THIS IS A

00:52:22.706 --> 00:52:25.609 region:rollup2
VIABLE OPTION AND.

00:52:24.708 --> 00:52:27.945 region:rollup2
AND IT LEAVES THE DELTA

00:52:25.609 --> 00:52:29.346 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY INTACT OR NOT MESSING

00:52:27.945 --> 00:52:29.980 region:rollup2
WITH THAT NAM MESSING WITH THE

00:52:29.346 --> 00:52:31.982 region:rollup2
SPECIES ON MESSING WITH ANY OF

00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:33.550 region:rollup2
THAT. AND SIMPLY TAKING

00:52:31.982 --> 00:52:35.452 region:rollup2
DESALINATED WATER.

00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:36.987 region:rollup2
FEELING THAT.

00:52:35.452 --> 00:52:38.922 region:rollup2
REST OF WAR WHERE WE MOVE ALL

00:52:36.987 --> 00:52:40.758 region:rollup2
THE DOUBTS WATER ANYWAY.

00:52:38.922 --> 00:52:42.192 region:rollup2
ON A REGULAR BASIS WHICH IS A

00:52:40.758 --> 00:52:44.261 region:rollup2
LOT MORE WATER THAN IT'S GETTING

00:52:42.192 --> 00:52:46.230 region:rollup2
FROM THE DELTA ANYWAY.

00:52:44.261 --> 00:52:47.898 region:rollup2
SO I'M MAKING THAT COMMENT TODAY

00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:49.133 region:rollup2
BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY I'M SICK

00:52:47.898 --> 00:52:50.801 region:rollup2
OF HEARING THAT OUR ONLY OPTION

00:52:49.133 --> 00:52:52.403 region:rollup2
IS THE DELTA. AND WHEN YOU LOOK

00:52:50.801 --> 00:52:54.204 region:rollup2
AT SEVENTEEN BILLION DOLLAR

00:52:52.403 --> 00:52:55.939 region:rollup2
PRICE TAX.

00:52:54.204 --> 00:52:58.676 region:rollup2
THAT STRAIGHT ACTUAR DOLLARS

00:52:55.939 --> 00:53:00.344 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU HAVE THE ABILITY FOR A

00:52:58.676 --> 00:53:01.879 region:rollup2
PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP.

00:53:00.344 --> 00:53:03.914 region:rollup2
THAT HAS A BETTER RELIABLE

00:53:01.879 --> 00:53:05.849 region:rollup2
SOURCE THAT'S NOT GOING BE

00:53:03.914 --> 00:53:06.884 region:rollup2
DEPENDENT UPON CLIMB IT.

00:53:05.849 --> 00:53:08.519 region:rollup2
I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT OTHER

00:53:06.884 --> 00:53:10.054 region:rollup2
OPTIONS.

00:53:08.519 --> 00:53:11.188 region:rollup2
ON I'M NOT GONNA BE VOTING ON

00:53:10.054 --> 00:53:13.090 region:rollup2
YOUR BILL TODAY.

00:53:11.188 --> 00:53:15.693 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK WE AS A STATE NEED

00:53:13.090 --> 00:53:17.227 region:rollup2
TO WALK AT OTHER WAYS AND OTHER

00:53:15.693 --> 00:53:19.697 region:rollup2
OPTIONS THAT ARE MUCH MUCH MORE

00:53:17.227 --> 00:53:21.298 region:rollup2
VIABLE. ON AND ARE GONNA COSTS

00:53:19.697 --> 00:53:23.400 region:rollup2
ARE TAXPAYERS LESS MONEY.

00:53:21.298 --> 00:53:27.638 region:rollup2
ON IT AND GET OUT OF THIS BOX

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:28.839 region:rollup2
THAT WE SEEM TRAPPED.

00:53:27.638 --> 00:53:30.441 region:rollup2
MR MATHESON I'D I APPRECIATE

00:53:28.839 --> 00:53:31.642 region:rollup2
YOUR CANDOR OF. ONE OF THE

00:53:30.441 --> 00:53:33.977 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT.

00:53:31.642 --> 00:53:35.112 region:rollup2
TROUBLES ME AS THE CHAIRMAN THE

00:53:33.977 --> 00:53:36.880 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE AND

00:53:35.112 --> 00:53:38.782 region:rollup2
WE'VE SEEN MEGA PROJECTS IN

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:41.051 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA LIKE THE BAY BRIDGE.

00:53:38.782 --> 00:53:41.618 region:rollup2
AND NOW HIGH SPEED RAY RAIL.

00:53:41.051 --> 00:53:43.020 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC HAS BEEN TOLD ONE

00:53:41.618 --> 00:53:44.521 region:rollup2
THING.

00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:46.090 region:rollup2
AND ANOTHER THING OCCURS THEY

00:53:44.521 --> 00:53:48.225 region:rollup2
GET INVOLVED IN THE PROJECT AND

00:53:46.090 --> 00:53:49.927 region:rollup2
THEN IT BECOMES A LARGER THAN

00:53:48.225 --> 00:53:50.727 region:rollup2
LIFE.

00:53:49.927 --> 00:53:52.296 region:rollup2
ISSUE THAT.

00:53:50.727 --> 00:53:53.330 region:rollup2
.

00:53:52.296 --> 00:53:55.432 region:rollup2
NOW WE HAVE TO TELL YOU ABOUT

00:53:53.330 --> 00:53:57.000 region:rollup2
THIS.

00:53:55.432 --> 00:53:58.535 region:rollup2
THIS IS WHAT I'M AFRAID OF ALSO

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.604 region:rollup2
IN THIS PROJECT THE RATEPAYERS

00:53:58.535 --> 00:54:03.373 region:rollup2
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AGAIN

00:54:00.604 --> 00:54:05.175 region:rollup2
WILL BE. OF SOLD A BILL OF GOODS

00:54:03.373 --> 00:54:06.643 region:rollup2
NO PUN INTENDED. AND IN THE

00:54:05.175 --> 00:54:08.979 region:rollup2
PROJECT BE DRAMATICALLY MORE

00:54:06.643 --> 00:54:09.480 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE.

00:54:08.979 --> 00:54:11.415 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT'S JUST WHAT

00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:13.484 region:rollup2
HAPPENS.

00:54:11.415 --> 00:54:15.319 region:rollup2
AND SO A AS YOU'VE MENTIONED

00:54:13.484 --> 00:54:17.755 region:rollup2
ALSO IN.

00:54:15.319 --> 00:54:19.156 region:rollup2
MY AREA IT PITTSBURG IN ANTIOCH

00:54:17.755 --> 00:54:21.091 region:rollup2
WE HAVE DECOMMISSIONED POWER

00:54:19.156 --> 00:54:22.593 region:rollup2
PLANTS THAT HAVE THE ABILITY TO

00:54:21.091 --> 00:54:23.293 region:rollup2
DISTILL WATER. IN THIS BRACKISH

00:54:22.593 --> 00:54:25.496 region:rollup2
WATER.

00:54:23.293 --> 00:54:27.164 region:rollup2
AREAS.

00:54:25.496 --> 00:54:28.799 region:rollup2
NEVER BEEN FACTORED IN AS AN

00:54:27.164 --> 00:54:31.168 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE AND AND AND AS FAR

00:54:28.799 --> 00:54:32.536 region:rollup2
AS I KNOW BUT AGAIN WITH IF IT'S

00:54:31.168 --> 00:54:34.071 region:rollup2
A SEVENTEEN BILLION DOLLAR

00:54:32.536 --> 00:54:35.973 region:rollup2
PROJECTED PROJECT.

00:54:34.071 --> 00:54:37.774 region:rollup2
THAT'S ABOUT SIXTEEN D. SELL

00:54:35.973 --> 00:54:39.076 region:rollup2
PLANTS.

00:54:37.774 --> 00:54:42.846 region:rollup2
THAT COULD PRODUCE ABOUT A

00:54:39.076 --> 00:54:45.249 region:rollup2
BILLION GALLONS OF WATER A DAY.

00:54:42.846 --> 00:54:47.317 region:rollup2
NEW WATER.

00:54:45.249 --> 00:54:49.486 region:rollup2
THIS PROJECT DOES NOT.

00:54:47.317 --> 00:54:50.521 region:rollup2
BUILD ONE DROP OF ADDITIONAL

00:54:49.486 --> 00:54:52.122 region:rollup2
WATER COMING THROUGH THOSE

00:54:50.521 --> 00:54:54.458 region:rollup2
TUNNELS.

00:54:52.122 --> 00:54:56.326 region:rollup2
AND SO I'M LOOKING FOR A FAIR

00:54:54.458 --> 00:54:58.529 region:rollup2
AND UNBIASED OPINION ABOUT HOW

00:54:56.326 --> 00:54:58.996 region:rollup2
WE CAN FROM MOVE FURTHER AND

00:54:58.529 --> 00:55:00.063 region:rollup2
PROTECT THE PEOPLE OF

00:54:58.996 --> 00:55:02.366 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:55:00.063 --> 00:55:05.002 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO PROVIDE A NOT SO

00:55:02.366 --> 00:55:07.271 region:rollup2
NECESSARY.

00:55:05.002 --> 00:55:08.906 region:rollup2
WATER OF PRODUCTS FOR THEM AYE

00:55:07.271 --> 00:55:10.340 region:rollup2
NEWMAN BAREST WHAT THE NEW

00:55:08.906 --> 00:55:12.276 region:rollup2
SCORING'S OF THE WATER BOARD

00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:14.645 region:rollup2
THEY CAME OUT RECENTLY IN THAT

00:55:12.276 --> 00:55:16.413 region:rollup2
ARE STORAGES. BEEN OF SCORED SO

00:55:14.645 --> 00:55:18.115 region:rollup2
LOW THAT THERE ARE WATER BOND

00:55:16.413 --> 00:55:21.885 region:rollup2
WILL BE INEFFECTIVE.

00:55:18.115 --> 00:55:23.086 region:rollup2
BASED ON A WHAT I VOTED ON.

00:55:21.885 --> 00:55:25.055 region:rollup2
AND SO YOU KNOW I'M. I'M

00:55:23.086 --> 00:55:27.491 region:rollup2
DISAPPOINTED THAT CALIFORNIA'S

00:55:25.055 --> 00:55:27.991 region:rollup2
NOT TAKING A LEAD IN SERVICING

00:55:27.491 --> 00:55:30.093 region:rollup2

AWAY TOO TO ACCOMMODATE FUTURE

00:55:31.962 --> 00:55:35.566 region:rollup2
GROWTH.

00:55:33.664 --> 00:55:37.401 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO.

00:58:15.625 --> 00:58:18.362 region:rollup2
THERE WE'VE GOT YOU YOUR GUARDS

00:58:16.526 --> 00:58:19.963 region:rollup2
OUT THERE. AND THERE BEEN MORE

00:58:18.362 --> 00:58:21.598 region:rollup2
SHARK SIGHTINGS THEY'VE HAD BEEN

00:58:19.963 --> 00:58:22.232 region:rollup2
PULLED PULLED THEY'VE HAD TO BE

00:58:21.598 --> 00:58:23.133 region:rollup2
IN A BAND BE PULLED OUT OF THE

00:58:22.232 --> 00:58:24.801 region:rollup2
WATER.

00:58:23.133 --> 00:58:27.104 region:rollup2
MANY TIMES DURING THE SUMMER

00:58:24.801 --> 00:58:27.738 region:rollup2
MONTHS BECAUSE THAT THE THE

00:58:27.104 --> 00:58:28.605 region:rollup2
INTERACTIONS WITH SHARKS OR THAT

00:58:27.738 --> 00:58:30.107 region:rollup2
THE.

00:58:28.605 --> 00:58:31.074 region:rollup2
THE PROXIMITY TO TO THE SHARKS

00:58:30.107 --> 00:58:33.310 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO GET IT CAN BETTER

00:58:31.074 --> 00:58:34.544 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT.

00:58:33.310 --> 00:58:35.946 region:rollup2
WELL THIS INCREASE IS A GREAT

00:58:34.544 --> 00:58:37.414 region:rollup2
SIGN FOR THE MARINE ECOSYSTEM

00:58:35.946 --> 00:58:39.383 region:rollup2
THIS INCREASED ACTIVITY MAKES

00:58:37.414 --> 00:58:41.118 region:rollup2
HUMAN SHARK INTERACTIONS MORE

00:58:39.383 --> 00:58:42.519 region:rollup2
LIGHTLY LIKELY FOR SURE.

00:58:41.118 --> 00:58:43.687 region:rollup2
WHEN THESE INTERACTIONS GO WRONG

00:58:42.519 --> 00:58:45.422 region:rollup2
THEY STOKE FEARS AND

00:58:43.687 --> 00:58:46.990 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S BEACH GOERS AND CAN

00:58:45.422 --> 00:58:48.425 region:rollup2
EVEN END IN TRAGEDY THERE'S

00:58:46.990 --> 00:58:50.093 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES AS WELL

00:58:48.425 --> 00:58:50.961 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

00:58:50.093 --> 00:58:51.962 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S A SHARK SIGHTINGS

00:58:50.961 --> 00:58:53.463 region:rollup2
THAT WE IN THE NEWSPAPER AND

00:58:51.962 --> 00:58:55.098 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WILL NOT GO TO VISIT

00:58:53.463 --> 00:58:56.900 region:rollup2
CERTAIN AREAS OF OUR STATE.

00:58:55.098 --> 00:58:58.301 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY'VE HEARD YOU KNOW

00:58:56.900 --> 00:58:59.836 region:rollup2
THAT'S BEEN SHARK ACTIVITY.

00:58:58.301 --> 00:59:01.805 region:rollup2
THANK THANKFULLY COOPERATIVE

00:58:59.836 --> 00:59:03.673 region:rollup2
EFFORTS EFFORTS BY RESEARCHERS

00:59:01.805 --> 00:59:05.308 region:rollup2
LIKE THOSE WITH THE SHARK LAB.

00:59:03.673 --> 00:59:06.943 region:rollup2
AT CSU LONG BEACH HAVE PARTNER

00:59:05.308 --> 00:59:09.046 region:rollup2
WITH LOCAL AGENCIES AND NON

00:59:06.943 --> 00:59:10.147 region:rollup2
PROFITS TO MONITOR SHARKS STUDY

00:59:09.046 --> 00:59:11.948 region:rollup2
THEIR BEHAVIORS AND EDUCATE. THE

00:59:10.147 --> 00:59:13.283 region:rollup2
PUBLIC.

00:59:11.948 --> 00:59:14.985 region:rollup2
THESE EFFORTS HELP PREVENT

00:59:13.283 --> 00:59:16.319 region:rollup2
INCIDENTS QUELL UNJUSTIFIED

00:59:14.985 --> 00:59:18.055 region:rollup2
FEARS AND PROVIDE THE DATA

00:59:16.319 --> 00:59:20.757 region:rollup2
NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND AND

00:59:18.055 --> 00:59:22.559 region:rollup2
PRESERVE OUR MARINE ECOSYSTEM.

00:59:20.757 --> 00:59:23.627 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THESE EFFORTS CAN ONLY

00:59:22.559 --> 00:59:25.095 region:rollup2
BE SUCCESSFUL WHEN THEY HAVE THE

00:59:23.627 --> 00:59:27.564 region:rollup2
RESOURCES NEEDED TO COMPLETE

00:59:25.095 --> 00:59:29.099 region:rollup2
THEIR WORK.

00:59:27.564 --> 00:59:29.933 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE NUMBER

00:59:29.099 --> 00:59:31.334 region:rollup2
OF SHARKS AT OUR BEACHES WAS SO

00:59:29.933 --> 00:59:33.503 region:rollup2
HIGH.

00:59:31.334 --> 00:59:35.906 region:rollup2
RESEARCHERS AT THAT CSU AT THAT

00:59:33.503 --> 00:59:37.574 region:rollup2
CSU LONG BEACH SHARK LAB RAT OUT

00:59:35.906 --> 00:59:38.542 region:rollup2
OF TRACKING TAGS TO PUT ON

00:59:37.574 --> 00:59:40.210 region:rollup2
SHARKS PART WAY THROUGH THE

00:59:38.542 --> 00:59:41.478 region:rollup2
SEASON.

00:59:40.210 --> 00:59:42.546 region:rollup2
IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT ARE

00:59:41.478 --> 00:59:44.281 region:rollup2
EFFORTS TO UNDERSTAND THESE

00:59:42.546 --> 00:59:45.882 region:rollup2
CREATURES PROTECT BEACH GOERS

00:59:44.281 --> 00:59:47.551 region:rollup2
ENSURE TOURISTS AREN'T SCARED

00:59:45.882 --> 00:59:49.219 region:rollup2
OFF FROM CALIFORNIA BEACHES WE

00:59:47.551 --> 00:59:50.620 region:rollup2
MUST BE WILLING TO INVEST IN

00:59:49.219 --> 00:59:52.222 region:rollup2
THOSE. WHO ARE IN OUR WATERS

00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:54.157 region:rollup2
DOING THE WORK?

00:59:52.222 --> 00:59:55.725 region:rollup2
AB TWENTY ONE NINETY ONE MAKES

00:59:54.157 --> 00:59:57.294 region:rollup2
THIS INVESTMENT BY CREATING A

00:59:55.725 --> 00:59:58.962 region:rollup2
GRANT PROGRAM FOR ACADEMIC

00:59:57.294 --> 01:00:00.697 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS PUBLIC AGENCIES AND

00:59:58.962 --> 01:00:02.499 region:rollup2
NON PROFITS EXPERIENCE CAN

01:00:00.697 --> 01:00:03.467 region:rollup2
ENGAGE IN SHARK RESEARCH.

01:00:02.499 --> 01:00:04.734 region:rollup2
A AND B. AND OUR BEACH SAFETY

01:00:03.467 --> 01:00:06.136 region:rollup2
EFFORTS.

01:00:04.734 --> 01:00:07.404 region:rollup2
THIS IS A HUMAN ISSUE THE ZEN

01:00:06.136 --> 01:00:09.072 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE BUT AGAIN I

01:00:07.404 --> 01:00:10.207 region:rollup2
I AS I SAID STATE EARLY IT'S

01:00:09.072 --> 01:00:11.374 region:rollup2
ALSO AN ECONOMIC ISSUE

01:00:10.207 --> 01:00:13.143 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WHAT WE WANT PEOPLE TO

01:00:11.374 --> 01:00:14.744 region:rollup2
COME TO OUR CALIFORNIA.

01:00:13.143 --> 01:00:15.979 region:rollup2
A WITH ME HERE TODAY A TO

01:00:14.744 --> 01:00:17.247 region:rollup2
PROVIDE TESTIMONY AS DOCTOR

01:00:15.979 --> 01:00:19.783 region:rollup2
CHRIS LOW HE'S DIRECTOR OF THE

01:00:17.247 --> 01:00:21.451 region:rollup2
SHARK LAB AT CSU LONG BEACH AND

01:00:19.783 --> 01:00:23.019 region:rollup2
ALICE KESSLER FROM THE YEAR. THE

01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:24.354 region:rollup2
CITY OF LONG BEACH AND YOU MAY

01:00:23.019 --> 01:00:26.323 region:rollup2
KNOW DOCTOR LOW IF YOU WATCH

01:00:24.354 --> 01:00:28.558 region:rollup2
SHARK WEEK YOU'VE SEEN HIM HE'S

01:00:26.323 --> 01:00:29.993 region:rollup2
THE SHARK WEEK GUY. HE IS

01:00:28.558 --> 01:00:32.629 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY ONE OF THE FOREMOST

01:00:29.993 --> 01:00:35.999 region:rollup2
WORLD EXPERTS ON SHARK BEHAVIOR

01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:36.800 region:rollup2
AND US I TURN IT OVER TO THEM.

01:00:35.999 --> 01:00:39.469 region:rollup2
THANK YOU SO.

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:40.704 region:rollup2
WE'VE KNOWN THAT PRIVATE LAST

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:41.972 region:rollup2
TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS FLETCHER

01:00:40.704 --> 01:00:43.540 region:rollup2
POPULATION SEEMS TO BE

01:00:41.972 --> 01:00:44.774 region:rollup2
INCREASING AND THE REASON FOR

01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:46.076 region:rollup2
THAT IS REALLY SIMPLE WE

01:00:44.774 --> 01:00:47.410 region:rollup2
PROTECTED WHITE SHARKS HERE

01:00:46.076 --> 01:00:48.512 region:rollup2
INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA BACK IN

01:00:47.410 --> 01:00:49.613 region:rollup2
NINETEEN NINETY FOUR.

01:00:48.512 --> 01:00:51.181 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT THE WHICH

01:00:49.613 --> 01:00:52.649 region:rollup2
OUR POPULATIONS BEEN AFFECTED

01:00:51.181 --> 01:00:54.818 region:rollup2
FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS BECAUSE

01:00:52.649 --> 01:00:56.186 region:rollup2
A LOSS OF MARINE MAMMALS.

01:00:54.818 --> 01:00:57.721 region:rollup2
IF YOU DO IT HER AND ALSO

01:00:56.186 --> 01:00:59.322 region:rollup2
PROTECTION.

01:00:57.721 --> 01:01:00.857 region:rollup2
SO THE GOOD NEWS IS WHAT CHURCH

01:00:59.322 --> 01:01:01.491 region:rollup2
COMING BACK BECAUSE OF THE

01:01:00.857 --> 01:01:03.393 region:rollup2
EFFORTS THAT WE PUT IN PLACE TO

01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:05.028 region:rollup2
PROTECT THEM.

01:01:03.393 --> 01:01:06.162 region:rollup2
THE TRICKY PART IS WE'VE LACK

01:01:05.028 --> 01:01:07.631 region:rollup2
THE TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO

01:01:06.162 --> 01:01:09.032 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY STUDY WHITE CHURCH

01:01:07.631 --> 01:01:10.367 region:rollup2
AND NOW THAT THERE POPULATIONS

01:01:09.032 --> 01:01:11.434 region:rollup2
COMING BACK WITH ONE'S REALLY

01:01:10.367 --> 01:01:12.869 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THINGS LIKE SOUTHERN

01:01:11.434 --> 01:01:14.070 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IS THE NURSERY FOR

01:01:12.869 --> 01:01:14.237 region:rollup2
WHITE SHARKS.

01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:17.173 region:rollup2
IN.

01:01:14.237 --> 01:01:18.742 region:rollup2
IN THAT NORTHEAST PACIFIC SIR

01:01:17.173 --> 01:01:19.843 region:rollup2
WHAT THAT MEANS IS CHARTER

01:01:18.742 --> 01:01:21.378 region:rollup2
COMING IN AND THEY'RE USING

01:01:19.843 --> 01:01:22.145 region:rollup2
THEIR BEACH HABITATS

01:01:21.378 --> 01:01:23.513 region:rollup2
SAME HABITATS AT SURFERS AND

01:01:22.145 --> 01:01:25.048 region:rollup2
SWIMMERS HE'S.

01:01:23.513 --> 01:01:26.683 region:rollup2
THAT HABITAT APPEARS TO BE VERY

01:01:25.048 --> 01:01:27.918 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT FOR THE SHARKS AND OF

01:01:26.683 --> 01:01:29.486 region:rollup2
COURSE ONCE THEY MATURE THEY

01:01:27.918 --> 01:01:30.887 region:rollup2
MOVED EITHER FURTHER NORTH TO

01:01:29.486 --> 01:01:32.355 region:rollup2
THAT CHANNEL ISLANDS OR THEY

01:01:30.887 --> 01:01:33.223 region:rollup2
MOVED TO THE FAIR LINES. WHERE

01:01:32.355 --> 01:01:34.191 region:rollup2
THEY'RE FEEDING PRIMARILY ON

01:01:33.223 --> 01:01:35.859 region:rollup2
MARINE MAMMALS IN THAT

01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:37.594 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS OF THOSE POPULATIONS

01:01:35.859 --> 01:01:39.162 region:rollup2
HAVE RECOVERED FAIRLY WELL SUSIE

01:01:37.594 --> 01:01:39.829 region:rollup2
COULD FEATURES?

01:01:39.162 --> 01:01:41.364 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S THE ONLY THE YEAR IN

01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:42.933 region:rollup2
THE JUVENILES HERRING VERY CLOSE

01:01:41.364 --> 01:01:43.533 region:rollup2
TO WHERE PEOPLE ARE AND THAT'S

01:01:42.933 --> 01:01:44.668 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN STUDYING

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:46.303 region:rollup2
FOR LAST.

01:01:44.668 --> 01:01:46.836 region:rollup2
TEN YEARS NOW WITH FUNDING FOR A

01:01:46.303 --> 01:01:48.138 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT OF FUNDING FROM

01:01:46.836 --> 01:01:49.506 region:rollup2
MONTEREY BAY AQUARIUM.

01:01:48.138 --> 01:01:50.607 region:rollup2
WE NOW HAVE ALL THIS NEW

01:01:49.506 --> 01:01:52.108 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY THAT'S LITERALLY

01:01:50.607 --> 01:01:53.376 region:rollup2
DEVELOP LAST FIVE YEARS THAT

01:01:52.108 --> 01:01:54.978 region:rollup2
WILL ENABLE US TO ANSWER ALL THE

01:01:53.376 --> 01:01:56.513 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT QUESTIONS.

01:01:54.978 --> 01:01:58.081 region:rollup2
THAT MANY THE THE WATER SAFETY

01:01:56.513 --> 01:01:59.849 region:rollup2
PERSONNEL NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO

01:01:58.081 --> 01:02:01.351 region:rollup2
KEEP PEOPLE SAFE.

01:01:59.849 --> 01:02:02.819 region:rollup2
MORE IMPORTANTLY IT'S THAT

01:02:01.351 --> 01:02:04.521 region:rollup2
SCIENCE THAT CAN BE USED TO

01:02:02.819 --> 01:02:06.523 region:rollup2
EDUCATE THE PUBLIC AND ALSO

01:02:04.521 --> 01:02:07.591 region:rollup2
WATER SAFETY PERSONNEL. SO THEY

01:02:06.523 --> 01:02:09.326 region:rollup2
CAN EFFECTIVELY DO THEIR JOB IN

01:02:07.591 --> 01:02:10.827 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC OF SAFER BUT USING

01:02:09.326 --> 01:02:13.296 region:rollup2
SOME CALIFORNIA WATERS.

01:02:10.827 --> 01:02:14.497 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:02:13.296 --> 01:02:16.199 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND

REPRESENTING THE CITY OF LONG

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:21.104 region:rollup2
BEACH UP WE STRONGLY SUPPORT

01:02:18.902 --> 01:02:23.373 region:rollup2
THIS LEGISLATION. THE POPULATION

01:02:21.104 --> 01:02:25.175 region:rollup2
GROWTH OF GREAT WHITE SHARKS HAS

01:02:23.373 --> 01:02:26.076 region:rollup2
IMPACTED LONG BEACH IN MULTIPLE

01:02:25.175 --> 01:02:28.245 region:rollup2
WAYS.

01:02:26.076 --> 01:02:29.813 region:rollup2
THREE THINGS I WANT TO

01:02:28.245 --> 01:02:31.915 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHT FIRST OF.

01:02:29.813 --> 01:02:34.084 region:rollup2
THE CITY AS OUR AUTHOR MENTION

01:02:31.915 --> 01:02:35.952 region:rollup2
DOES PROVIDE MULTIPLE MARINE

01:02:34.084 --> 01:02:36.820 region:rollup2
RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES.

01:02:35.952 --> 01:02:39.089 region:rollup2
AND.

01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:41.157 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN ALONE THERE

01:02:39.089 --> 01:02:43.627 region:rollup2
WERE TEN GREAT WHITE SIGHTINGS

01:02:41.157 --> 01:02:45.161 region:rollup2
AND IT IT DOES AS WAS MENTIONED.

01:02:43.627 --> 01:02:46.796 region:rollup2
STRIKE FEAR AND.

01:02:45.161 --> 01:02:48.398 region:rollup2
THOSE THAT ARE SEEKING TO WRECK

01:02:46.796 --> 01:02:50.300 region:rollup2
RATE ON OUR BEACHES SO IT'S

01:02:48.398 --> 01:02:52.135 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE TO

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:53.670 region:rollup2
HAVE THE RESOURCES TO PURSUE THE

01:02:52.135 --> 01:02:55.071 region:rollup2
POLICY SOLUTIONS THAT WILL MAKE

01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:57.507 region:rollup2
PEOPLE FEEL SAFE.

01:02:55.071 --> 01:02:58.541 region:rollup2
SECOND. LONG BEACH DOZEN JOY A

01:02:57.507 --> 01:02:59.209 region:rollup2
UNIQUE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE

01:02:58.541 --> 01:03:01.611 region:rollup2
SHARK LAB.

01:02:59.209 --> 01:03:02.579 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY IS IT SITUATED AND IN

01:03:01.611 --> 01:03:04.247 region:rollup2
LONG BEACH BUT.

01:03:02.579 --> 01:03:05.548 region:rollup2
IT COLLABORATES CLOSELY WITH

01:03:04.247 --> 01:03:08.118 region:rollup2
OUR LOCAL PUBLIC SAFETY

01:03:05.548 --> 01:03:10.020 region:rollup2
OFFICIALS TO ADDRESS THE IMPACT

01:03:08.118 --> 01:03:11.054 region:rollup2
OF THE POPULATION GROWTH.

01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:12.789 region:rollup2
IN THE SHARK LAB WOULD BE ABLE

01:03:11.054 --> 01:03:13.957 region:rollup2
TO TO APPLY FOR GRANTS UNDER

01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:15.959 region:rollup2
THIS PROGRAM.

01:03:13.957 --> 01:03:17.894 region:rollup2
TO SUPPORT ITS WORK TO REDUCE

01:03:15.959 --> 01:03:19.596 region:rollup2
SHARK ATTACKS ON BY USING THESE

01:09:34.804 --> 01:09:37.940 region:rollup2
BUT WE WERE ABLE THAT WE WERE

01:09:36.272 --> 01:09:39.709 region:rollup2
ABLE TO THAT RECHARGE UP TO

01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:41.844 region:rollup2
FORTY FIVE HUNDRED ACRE FEET OF

01:09:39.709 --> 01:09:46.049 region:rollup2
FLOODWATER THAT YEAR.

01:09:41.844 --> 01:09:46.382 region:rollup2
AND WE DIDN'T KILLER VINEYARD.

01:09:46.049 --> 01:09:48.484 region:rollup2
TWENTY ELEVEN.

01:09:46.382 --> 01:09:50.053 region:rollup2
KIND OF.

01:09:48.484 --> 01:09:51.954 region:rollup2
I EARNED THE NICKNAME OF THE

FATHER OF GROUNDWATER RECHARGE

01:09:51.954 --> 01:09:55.458 region:rollup2
OR PROBABLY MORE APTLY.

01:09:53.556 --> 01:09:59.462 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE GRANDFATHER GRANTHA

01:09:55.458 --> 01:10:01.030 region:rollup2
FOR. SOME GROUNDWATER RECHARGE.

01:09:59.462 --> 01:10:02.598 region:rollup2
BUT WE ALSO CAPTURED THE WE

01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:03.566 region:rollup2
FLIPPED IT FEEL PART OF PLANNING

01:10:02.598 --> 01:10:06.235 region:rollup2
A CROP PROVING THAT WE COULD

01:10:03.566 --> 01:10:07.970 region:rollup2
TERM FARMLAND INTO US LARGE

01:10:06.235 --> 01:10:09.839 region:rollup2
RECHARGE AREAS.

01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:10.907 region:rollup2
TO CAPTURE THE FLOODWATER WHILE

01:10:09.839 --> 01:10:13.309 region:rollup2
IMPROVING GROUNDWATER CONDITIONS

01:10:10.907 --> 01:10:15.244 region:rollup2
AT THE SAME TIME.

01:10:13.309 --> 01:10:16.813 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN

01:10:15.244 --> 01:10:18.114 region:rollup2
SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRE FEET

01:10:16.813 --> 01:10:19.248 region:rollup2
LEFT THE BASE AND DID FLOOD

01:10:18.114 --> 01:10:22.351 region:rollup2
RELEASE THAT WERE LOST TO THE

01:10:19.248 --> 01:10:24.220 region:rollup2
OCEAN.

01:10:22.351 --> 01:10:26.556 region:rollup2

PROJECT TO IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN

01:10:26.556 --> 01:10:29.692 region:rollup2
WE BEGAN FLOODING WALLETS.

SPECIALS AN OLIVE WITH.

01:10:32.261 --> 01:10:35.098 region:rollup2
PUSHING IT TO THE LIMIT.

01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:37.200 region:rollup2
FOR THE PURPOSE OF GROUNDWATER

01:10:35.098 --> 01:10:38.167 region:rollup2
RECHARGE.

01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:42.872 region:rollup2
WE DID THIS DURING THE PERIOD

01:10:38.167 --> 01:10:44.207 region:rollup2
FROM NOW FEBRUARY THROUGH JULY.

01:10:42.872 --> 01:10:46.142 region:rollup2
IT'S THE BIT WITH PRETTY

01:10:44.207 --> 01:10:47.910 region:rollup2
UNPRECEDENTED.

01:10:46.142 --> 01:10:49.345 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A VINEYARD ONE VINEYARD

01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:50.646 region:rollup2
THAT LAST YEAR WE PUT THIRTEEN

01:10:49.345 --> 01:10:54.050 region:rollup2
ACRE FEET OF WATER ON FOR

01:10:50.646 --> 01:10:56.152 region:rollup2
GROUNDWATER RECHARGE.

01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:58.020 region:rollup2
WE EXPANDED OUR PROJECT DEATH

01:10:56.152 --> 01:10:59.322 region:rollup2
CLICK SAY TO TO OVER.

01:10:58.020 --> 01:11:02.925 region:rollup2
FIVE THOUSAND ACRES.

01:10:59.322 --> 01:11:03.860 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN.

01:11:02.925 --> 01:11:05.428 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY DOES THIS WATER

01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:07.663 region:rollup2
REPLENISH OUR AQUIFER BUT IT

01:11:05.428 --> 01:11:09.232 region:rollup2
PROVIDES HABITAT FOR WILDLIFE.

01:11:07.663 --> 01:11:11.601 region:rollup2
PRIMARILY SHOREBIRDS AND

01:11:09.232 --> 01:11:13.469 region:rollup2
WATERFOWL WE HAD ALL TYPES OF

01:11:11.601 --> 01:11:14.670 region:rollup2
BIRDS COMING INTO OUR REGION

01:11:13.469 --> 01:11:16.606 region:rollup2
JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE APPLIED THE

01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:18.541 region:rollup2
WATER TO OUR FIELDS.

01:11:16.606 --> 01:11:20.476 region:rollup2
WE EVEN HAD SENATOR FEINSTEIN

01:11:18.541 --> 01:11:24.714 region:rollup2
VISITOR PROJECT TO AND OFFER HER

01:11:20.476 --> 01:11:26.182 region:rollup2
SUPPORT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL.

01:11:24.714 --> 01:11:27.884 region:rollup2
THE FLOODWATER BECAUSE LEVY

01:11:26.182 --> 01:11:30.052 region:rollup2
BREAKS AND FLOODING DOWNSTREAM

01:11:27.884 --> 01:11:31.354 region:rollup2
TO THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

01:11:30.052 --> 01:11:32.822 region:rollup2
AND OTHER FARM LAND ON ITS WAY

01:11:31.354 --> 01:11:34.557 region:rollup2
TO THE OCEAN.

01:11:32.822 --> 01:11:36.225 region:rollup2
THE TERRANOVA WERE EXPANDING OUR

01:11:34.557 --> 01:11:37.793 region:rollup2
RECHARGE EFFORTS WERE BUILDING

01:11:36.225 --> 01:11:39.428 region:rollup2
MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WILL

01:11:37.793 --> 01:11:41.230 region:rollup2
ENABLE US TO CAPTURE. UP TO

01:11:39.428 --> 01:11:43.232 region:rollup2
THIRTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET PER

01:11:41.230 --> 01:11:44.867 region:rollup2
MONTH WHEN FLOODWATERS AVAILABLE

01:11:43.232 --> 01:11:47.069 region:rollup2
TO SPREAD ON UP TO EIGHTEEN

01:11:44.867 --> 01:11:51.174 region:rollup2
THOUSAND ACRES OF. OUR FARM AND

01:11:47.069 --> 01:11:52.775 region:rollup2
OUR NEIGHBORS FARMS.

01:11:51.174 --> 01:11:53.276 region:rollup2
BY RECHARGING IN OUR AREA WERE

01:11:52.775 --> 01:11:56.112 region:rollup2
STARTING TO. REBUILD THE

AQUIFER.

01:11:56.112 --> 01:12:01.417 region:rollup2
TO CORRECT NOT ONLY OUR BASIN.

01:11:59.382 --> 01:12:02.585 region:rollup2
SURROUNDING BASINS TO THE WEST

01:12:01.417 --> 01:12:04.820 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WATER

01:12:02.585 --> 01:12:06.322 region:rollup2
DOESN'T REMAIN IN ONE PLACE IT

01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:09.258 region:rollup2
DEFTLY MOVES FROM ONE AREA TO

01:12:06.322 --> 01:12:10.793 region:rollup2
ANOTHER.

01:12:09.258 --> 01:12:12.228 region:rollup2
AB TWENTY SIX FORTY NINE IS

01:12:10.793 --> 01:12:13.663 region:rollup2
NEEDED EVEN MORE WITH CLIMATE

01:12:12.228 --> 01:12:15.898 region:rollup2
CHANGE.

01:12:13.663 --> 01:12:17.667 region:rollup2
WE EXPECT A THREE.

01:12:15.898 --> 01:12:19.836 region:rollup2
INCREASING WATER FLOWS FOR

01:12:17.667 --> 01:12:21.637 region:rollup2
INFLOWS HIGHER. HIGHER SNOW

01:12:19.836 --> 01:12:23.873 region:rollup2
LEVELS TO WHERE NORMALLY WE READ

01:12:21.637 --> 01:12:25.808 region:rollup2
WE CAN HOLD OUR WATER IN THE.

01:12:23.873 --> 01:12:27.543 region:rollup2
STERN ABOUT A.

01:12:25.808 --> 01:12:29.579 region:rollup2
THIS A GOOD OR A REAL GAME

01:12:27.543 --> 01:12:31.547 region:rollup2
CHANGER FOR US THEN.

01:12:29.579 --> 01:12:33.249 region:rollup2
IT CAN ALLOW GROWERS THEMSELVES

01:12:31.547 --> 01:12:35.051 region:rollup2
TO REBUILD THE UNDERGROUND WATER

01:12:33.249 --> 01:12:37.019 region:rollup2

SUSTAIN CONSERVATION HAS BEEN

01:13:09.919 --> 01:13:12.989 region:rollup2
ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN ADVANCING

01:13:11.487 --> 01:13:14.523 region:rollup2
GROUNDWATER RECHARGE SINCE

01:13:12.989 --> 01:13:16.559 region:rollup2
TWENTY ELEVEN WORKING VERY

01:13:14.523 --> 01:13:18.661 region:rollup2
CLOSELY WITH DON CAMERON.

01:13:16.559 --> 01:13:21.430 region:rollup2
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING PRIMARILY

01:13:18.661 --> 01:13:24.033 region:rollup2
THE NOT EXCLUSIVELY ON ON FARM.

01:13:21.430 --> 01:13:25.334 region:rollup2
Y. RECHARGE.

01:13:24.033 --> 01:13:27.270 region:rollup2
WE UNDERSTOOD OBVIOUSLY WE

01:13:25.334 --> 01:13:29.171 region:rollup2
UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:31.107 region:rollup2
RECHARGE BEFORE SIGMA BUT THE

01:13:29.171 --> 01:13:32.842 region:rollup2
PASSAGE OF THAT ACT MADE OUR

01:13:31.107 --> 01:13:34.076 region:rollup2
AWARENESS AND A RECOGNITION OF

01:13:32.842 --> 01:13:36.379 region:rollup2
THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS OF

WE ARE.

01:13:38.547 --> 01:13:41.918 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT RECHARGE WILL BE

01:13:39.715 --> 01:13:44.387 region:rollup2
VITAL TO IMPLEMENTING SIGMA IN A

01:13:41.918 --> 01:13:46.489 region:rollup2
WAY THAT MITIGATES ITS IMPACT BY

01:13:44.387 --> 01:13:47.623 region:rollup2
ENHANCING SUPPLY.

01:13:46.489 --> 01:13:49.425 region:rollup2

AND ENVIRONMENTAL USES.

01:13:55.731 --> 01:13:59.936 region:rollup2
ALL WE KNOW THAT THE BENEFICIAL

USE ISSUE IS HIGHLY CONTENTIOUS.

01:13:59.936 --> 01:14:02.939 region:rollup2
ARE WE BELIEVE THAT WATER

01:14:00.970 --> 01:14:04.307 region:rollup2
MANAGERS DEEP UNCERTAINTY ABOUT

01:14:02.939 --> 01:14:07.243 region:rollup2
HOW TO PROCEED WITH RECHARGE

01:14:04.307 --> 01:14:09.378 region:rollup2
PRAGUE PROJECTS WITHOUT. RISKING

01:14:07.243 --> 01:14:11.180 region:rollup2
REGULATORY ACTION HAS BEEN BOTH

01:14:09.378 --> 01:14:12.682 region:rollup2
THE CAUSE AND RESULT OF A GREAT

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:14.517 region:rollup2
DEAL OF THAT CONTENTION.

01:14:12.682 --> 01:14:16.986 region:rollup2
THAT UNCERTAINTY NEEDS TO BE

01:14:14.517 --> 01:14:18.354 region:rollup2
REMOVED SO THAT GSA'S AND OTHERS

01:14:16.986 --> 01:14:20.156 region:rollup2
CAN UTILIZE RECHARGE TO THE

01:14:18.354 --> 01:14:21.524 region:rollup2
MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE.

01:14:20.156 --> 01:14:23.225 region:rollup2
A WE BELIEVE THAT THE AMENDMENTS

SUPPORT THEM WHOLEHEARTEDLY.

01:14:28.297 --> 01:14:31.367 region:rollup2
BUT WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT IT'S

01:14:29.732 --> 01:14:32.802 region:rollup2
NECESSARY TO MAKE PROGRESS TO OF

01:14:31.367 --> 01:14:34.236 region:rollup2
MAKE THE PROCESS FOR OBTAINING

01:21:35.190 --> 01:21:37.559 region:rollup2
SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS AND I'M I

01:21:36.992 --> 01:21:38.427 region:rollup2
DO THINK THE COMMITTEE STAFF

01:21:37.559 --> 01:21:39.261 region:rollup2
DID.

01:21:38.427 --> 01:21:40.863 region:rollup2
GREAT WORK TRYING TO FIND

01:21:39.261 --> 01:21:41.130 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE THAT THAT IS MORE

01:21:40.863 --> 01:21:42.798 region:rollup2
WORKABLE.

01:21:41.130 --> 01:21:44.099 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK WE STILL HAVE

01:21:42.798 --> 01:21:45.868 region:rollup2
CONCERNS WITH THIS APPROACH AND

01:21:44.099 --> 01:21:47.770 region:rollup2
OUR. PARTICULAR BEEN SAYING THAT

01:21:45.868 --> 01:21:48.470 region:rollup2
SOMEONE HAS A BENEFICIAL USE TO

01:21:47.770 --> 01:21:49.171 region:rollup2
A PORTION OF A GROUND WATER BASE

01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:50.372 region:rollup2
AND.

01:21:49.171 --> 01:21:51.840 region:rollup2
WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE

01:21:50.372 --> 01:21:53.409 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL FOR PRIVATIZATION OF

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:55.377 region:rollup2
GROUNDWATER BASIN SAYING THAT

01:21:53.409 --> 01:21:56.645 region:rollup2
PEOPLE HAVE SPECIFIC ACCESS TO

01:21:55.377 --> 01:21:58.881 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC PARTS OF THAT AQUIFER

01:21:56.645 --> 01:21:59.181 region:rollup2
WHEN IN REALITY THESE ARE PUBLIC

01:21:59.181 --> 01:22:01.150 region:rollup2
.

01:22:00.215 --> 01:22:02.618 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY WE'RE CONCERNED

01:22:01.150 --> 01:22:02.918 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE USE OF SEQUEL

01:22:02.618 --> 01:22:04.186 region:rollup2
EXEMPTIONS.

01:22:02.918 --> 01:22:05.854 region:rollup2
.

01:22:04.186 --> 01:22:07.289 region:rollup2
OUT NGUYEN CHANGING A WATER

01:22:05.854 --> 01:22:09.124 region:rollup2
RIGHT THE WATER BOARD TESTIFYING

01:22:07.289 --> 01:22:11.026 region:rollup2

USER OF WATERS INJURED OR

01:22:11.026 --> 01:22:13.595 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO UNREASONABLE FACTS

01:22:12.461 --> 01:22:15.197 region:rollup2
OFFICIAL WILDLIFE AND WHILE MOST

01:22:13.595 --> 01:22:17.065 region:rollup2
OF THESE PROJECTS. WON'T HAVE

01:22:15.197 --> 01:22:18.033 region:rollup2
THOSE ISSUES SOME CODE AND THE

01:22:17.065 --> 01:22:19.568 region:rollup2
SEQUEL PROCESS IS HELPFUL FOR

01:22:18.033 --> 01:22:20.903 region:rollup2
DETERMINING IMPACTS THAT CAN

01:22:19.568 --> 01:22:23.539 region:rollup2

FISH AND WILDLIFE.

01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:27.009 region:rollup2
AND SO WE THINK THAT THERE'S

01:22:26.108 --> 01:22:28.577 region:rollup2
THERE COULD BE ANOTHER APPROACH

01:22:27.009 --> 01:22:29.645 region:rollup2
FORWARD ON THIS ISSUE I AM AND

01:22:28.577 --> 01:22:30.979 region:rollup2

CAN WE DETERMINE AT WHAT

01:22:34.049 --> 01:22:37.753 region:rollup2

DOCTOR ARAMBULA. YOU KNOW I

01:24:10.646 --> 01:24:13.115 region:rollup2
DEFINITELY WITH THE CONCEPT AND

01:24:12.581 --> 01:24:14.583 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I THINK THIS IS

01:24:13.115 --> 01:24:15.817 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD. TRY

01:24:14.583 --> 01:24:18.353 region:rollup2
AND FIND A WAY ON TO BE ABLE TO

01:24:15.817 --> 01:24:19.888 region:rollup2
USE THIS WATER FOR RECHARGE.

01:24:18.353 --> 01:24:21.390 region:rollup2
.

01:24:19.888 --> 01:24:23.425 region:rollup2

AND THIS BILL IS BEFORE US LAST.

01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:30.933 region:rollup2
THAT LAST YEAR I THINK AS WELL.

01:24:28.130 --> 01:24:31.500 region:rollup2
AND AND THE THE CONCERN HERE IS

01:24:30.933 --> 01:24:32.467 region:rollup2
NOT THAT WE DON'T THINK THAT

01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:34.636 region:rollup2
WOULD BE.

01:24:32.467 --> 01:24:36.338 region:rollup2
YA BENEFICIAL USE TO TO

01:24:34.636 --> 01:24:38.340 region:rollup2
RECHARGE JOB OFFERS AND HAVE

01:24:36.338 --> 01:24:39.007 region:rollup2
THAT WATER BUT RATHER.

01:24:38.340 --> 01:24:41.109 region:rollup2
WHAT'S THE IMPACT TO DEATH IN A

01:24:39.007 --> 01:24:42.678 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY OTHER WATER USERS

01:24:41.109 --> 01:24:44.646 region:rollup2
AND IS THAT WATER THAT'S BEING

01:24:42.678 --> 01:24:46.882 region:rollup2
TAKEN THAT. MIGHT OTHERWISE GO

01:24:44.646 --> 01:24:48.250 region:rollup2
TO OTHERS AND THEN THERE'S ALSO.

01:24:46.882 --> 01:24:50.252 region:rollup2
YOUR POTENTIAL ECOLOGICAL

01:24:48.250 --> 01:24:51.353 region:rollup2
CONCERNS AS WELL.

01:24:50.252 --> 01:24:52.554 region:rollup2
SO.

01:24:51.353 --> 01:24:54.156 region:rollup2
AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE HAS

01:24:52.554 --> 01:24:55.190 region:rollup2
BEEN A STAKEHOLDER GROUP WORKING

01:24:54.156 --> 01:24:56.091 region:rollup2
ON THIS ISSUE THAT THEY'RE

01:24:55.190 --> 01:24:57.893 region:rollup2
GETTING PRETTY CLOSE TO

01:24:56.091 --> 01:24:58.460 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT TO A CONCEPT THAT

01:24:57.893 --> 01:24:59.728 region:rollup2
COULD WORK THAT WOULD ALLOW

01:24:58.460 --> 01:25:01.096 region:rollup2
THIS.

01:24:59.728 --> 01:25:02.664 region:rollup2
SO I GUESS MAYBE TWO PARTS IS

01:25:01.096 --> 01:25:03.265 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW HOW.

01:25:02.664 --> 01:25:04.1000 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT YOU'RE

01:25:03.265 --> 01:25:07.102 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW ADDRESS

01:25:04.1000 --> 01:25:08.670 region:rollup2
ADDRESSES THAT MAYBE I'M MISSING

01:25:07.102 --> 01:25:10.672 region:rollup2
SOMETHING AND THEN.

01:25:08.670 --> 01:25:12.174 region:rollup2
SECONDLY. WHY NOT ALLOW THAT

01:25:10.672 --> 01:25:13.976 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDER PROCESS TO KIND OF

01:25:12.174 --> 01:25:15.444 region:rollup2
PHOENICIAN AND MAYBE GET TO A

01:25:13.976 --> 01:25:16.945 region:rollup2
PLACE WHERE WE BUT WE WILL BE

01:25:15.444 --> 01:25:18.180 region:rollup2
ABLE TO USE WATER IN A WAY

01:25:16.945 --> 01:25:19.014 region:rollup2
THAT'S FOR?

01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:20.849 region:rollup2
GROUNDWATER RECHARGE

01:25:19.014 --> 01:25:22.517 region:rollup2
THANK YOU AND.

01:25:20.849 --> 01:25:24.353 region:rollup2
I APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS AND

01:25:22.517 --> 01:25:26.188 region:rollup2
FRANKLY THE CONVERSATION THAT

01:25:24.353 --> 01:25:27.356 region:rollup2
WE'RE HAVING HERE TODAY.

01:25:26.188 --> 01:25:29.591 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR OUR

01:25:27.356 --> 01:25:31.560 region:rollup2
STATES TO HAVE THE SUBSTANTIVE.

01:25:29.591 --> 01:25:32.127 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS BUT ALL ADDRESSED

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:33.562 region:rollup2
YOUR QUESTION DIRECTLY IF I

01:25:32.127 --> 01:25:35.130 region:rollup2
CAN'T.

01:25:33.562 --> 01:25:36.965 region:rollup2
THERE'S AN URGENCY TO THIS

01:25:35.130 --> 01:25:38.367 region:rollup2
MATTER WHICH IS THIS GOVERNOR IS

01:25:36.965 --> 01:25:39.868 region:rollup2
LEAVING AT THE END OF THE YEAR.

01:25:38.367 --> 01:25:40.402 region:rollup2
AND IF WE DON'T CODIFY HIS

01:25:39.868 --> 01:25:42.371 region:rollup2
EXECUTIVE ORDER BEFORE HE

01:25:40.402 --> 01:25:44.773 region:rollup2
LEAVES.

01:25:42.371 --> 01:25:46.341 region:rollup2
WE'RE STARTING ON THE FIRST DAY

01:25:44.773 --> 01:25:47.776 region:rollup2
OF THE NEW ADMINISTRATION TO

01:25:46.341 --> 01:25:50.012 region:rollup2
CONVINCE THEM OF WHAT WE HAVE

01:25:47.776 --> 01:25:51.313 region:rollup2
ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED SO FAR.

01:25:50.012 --> 01:25:52.648 region:rollup2
TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION ABOUT

01:25:51.313 --> 01:25:54.016 region:rollup2
THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS

01:25:52.648 --> 01:25:55.684 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOING ON.

01:25:54.016 --> 01:25:57.686 region:rollup2
I'VE HAD SOME PRELIMINARY

01:25:55.684 --> 01:25:58.787 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS WITH DOCTOR EGGMAN

01:25:57.686 --> 01:26:01.089 region:rollup2
AND WOULD BE WILLING TO

01:25:58.787 --> 01:26:04.192 region:rollup2
COLLABORATE AND WORK WITH HER.

01:26:01.089 --> 01:26:05.761 region:rollup2
TO JOIN OUR PROCESS CITIES SO

01:26:04.192 --> 01:26:08.330 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN DO THIS FOR THE

01:26:05.761 --> 01:26:10.232 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT IT IS A

01:26:08.330 --> 01:26:12.434 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT NEEDLE TO THREAD AND

01:26:10.232 --> 01:26:13.902 region:rollup2
ONE THAT WILL REQUIRE A LOT OF

01:26:12.434 --> 01:26:15.570 region:rollup2
US TO COLLABORATE AND WORK

01:26:13.902 --> 01:26:18.240 region:rollup2
TOGETHER. I DON'T PRETEND TO

01:26:15.570 --> 01:26:18.907 region:rollup2
HAVE THE ANSWERS AND REALLY HAVE

01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:20.575 region:rollup2
BEEN PLEASED TO WORK WITH THIS

01:26:18.907 --> 01:26:21.977 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE AND AND THE STAFF AS

01:26:20.575 --> 01:26:24.579 region:rollup2
WELL AS WANTING TO CONTINUE TO

01:26:21.977 --> 01:26:25.047 region:rollup2
WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. TO

01:26:24.579 --> 01:26:27.082 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT WHAT WE CAN

01:26:25.047 --> 01:26:27.682 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISH.

01:26:27.082 --> 01:26:29.551 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I WAS MOVED A BIT BY

01:26:27.682 --> 01:26:31.386 region:rollup2
WHAT A SIERRA SAID THAT.

01:26:29.551 --> 01:26:32.654 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT'S POURING AND NOW

01:26:31.386 --> 01:26:34.289 region:rollup2
WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE A PLANNED

01:26:32.654 --> 01:26:35.590 region:rollup2
WELL I'M TRYING TO HAVE THOSE

01:26:34.289 --> 01:26:36.658 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS NOW.

01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:38.827 region:rollup2
SO THAT THE NEXT TIME IT'S

01:26:36.658 --> 01:26:40.262 region:rollup2
RAINING INSTEAD OF THIS EXCESS

01:26:38.827 --> 01:26:42.397 region:rollup2
UNUSED WATER GOING OUT TO THE

01:26:40.262 --> 01:26:43.765 region:rollup2
OCEAN. WE HAVE THE ABILITY WE

01:26:42.397 --> 01:26:45.700 region:rollup2
HAVE A PLAN FOR THE STATE OF

01:26:43.765 --> 01:26:47.803 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA TO DO THE DESIGN

01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:49.671 region:rollup2
GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AS WE SEE

01:26:47.803 --> 01:26:51.173 region:rollup2
FIT AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY. BUT I

01:27:54.970 --> 01:27:57.372 region:rollup2
WELL IN TERMS OF YOUR.

01:27:56.338 --> 01:27:58.473 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PLANNING

01:27:57.372 --> 01:28:00.008 region:rollup2
FOR THE FUTURE AND HOW WE'RE

01:27:58.473 --> 01:28:01.610 region:rollup2
COLLECTING GROUND WATER AND THE

01:28:00.008 --> 01:28:03.578 region:rollup2
CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF THAT.

01:28:01.610 --> 01:28:05.080 region:rollup2
WELL WE DON'T HAVE THE RAIN SO

YOU FORESEE WOULD BE AWAY THAT

01:28:06.381 --> 01:28:10.118 region:rollup2
THIS BILL WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED

01:28:08.283 --> 01:28:12.154 region:rollup2
OR CAN BE HELPFUL TO THE STATE

01:28:10.118 --> 01:28:14.222 region:rollup2
IN THE DRY YEARS I ANTICIPATE

01:28:12.154 --> 01:28:16.892 region:rollup2
THIS BILL HAS NO EFFECT THAT?

01:28:14.222 --> 01:28:18.493 region:rollup2
IF A SENIOR RIGHT STIFF JUNIOR

01:28:16.892 --> 01:28:21.129 region:rollup2

HAVE NOT BEEN MET THIS BILL HAS

01:28:21.129 --> 01:28:24.399 region:rollup2
NO. USE AT ALL.

01:28:22.764 --> 01:28:26.201 region:rollup2
IT'S ONLY IN THOSE ONCE IN A

01:28:24.399 --> 01:28:27.636 region:rollup2
DECADE.

01:28:26.201 --> 01:28:29.938 region:rollup2
TYPES OF SITUATIONS LIKE WE HAD

01:28:27.636 --> 01:28:32.340 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR. WHERE THERE'S ACCESS

01:28:29.938 --> 01:28:34.676 region:rollup2
ON USED WATER THAT'S ACTUALLY

01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:36.745 region:rollup2
PRESENTING A HARM TO OUR STATE?

01:28:34.676 --> 01:28:38.313 region:rollup2
THE RISK TOO DOWNSTREAM IS THE

01:28:36.745 --> 01:28:40.916 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL FLOODING THAT CAN

01:28:38.313 --> 01:28:42.417 region:rollup2
OCCUR WITH THAT MUCH WATER. IT'S

01:28:40.916 --> 01:28:44.419 region:rollup2
IN THOSE OPPORTUNITIES THAT I

01:28:42.417 --> 01:28:47.589 region:rollup2
REALLY WANT OUR STATE TOOK CRAFT

01:28:44.419 --> 01:28:49.124 region:rollup2
A PLAN. TO HELP US TO DEAL WITH

01:28:47.589 --> 01:28:50.425 region:rollup2
AN OVER DRAFTING PROBLEM AS WELL

01:28:49.124 --> 01:28:51.126 region:rollup2
AS SICK.

01:28:50.425 --> 01:28:53.495 region:rollup2
AND.

01:28:51.126 --> 01:28:54.229 region:rollup2
IF I CAN SOAPBOX JUST FOR HALF

01:28:53.495 --> 01:28:56.064 region:rollup2
A SECOND.

01:28:54.229 --> 01:28:57.499 region:rollup2
WORKING IN THE ER I SAW THE

01:28:56.064 --> 01:28:59.834 region:rollup2
EFFECT OF OUR DROUGHT ON MY

COMMUNITY ON MY PEOPLE AND

01:28:59.834 --> 01:29:03.705 region:rollup2

01:29:01.469 --> 01:29:06.408 region:rollup2
LAWS LIKE THIS DOING GROUNDWATER

01:29:03.705 --> 01:29:08.243 region:rollup2
RECHARGE. TO HELP MY COMMUNITY

01:29:06.408 --> 01:29:09.845 region:rollup2
TO HAVE SUSTAINABILITY AND

01:29:08.243 --> 01:29:11.713 region:rollup2
BELIEVES THAT.

01:29:09.845 --> 01:29:13.815 region:rollup2
HAVING SOMETHING IN PLACE FOR

01:29:11.713 --> 01:29:17.619 region:rollup2
THOSE FUTURE WHAT YEARS WILL

01:29:13.815 --> 01:29:18.820 region:rollup2
ALLOW OUR COMMUNITIES TO THRIVE.

01:29:17.619 --> 01:29:20.689 region:rollup2
MY OF MISTER SALAS FOLLOWED BY

01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:22.357 region:rollup2

THANK YOU THAT THANK YOU DOCTOR

EVELYN FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE

01:29:23.658 --> 01:29:25.927 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

01:29:23.892 --> 01:29:26.995 region:rollup2
TO STICK.

01:29:25.927 --> 01:29:28.496 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE WAY I SEE THIS BILL

01:29:26.995 --> 01:29:30.232 region:rollup2
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG IS

01:29:28.496 --> 01:29:32.133 region:rollup2
YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO USE EXCESS

01:29:30.232 --> 01:29:33.902 region:rollup2
WATER LIKE WE HAD.

01:29:32.133 --> 01:29:36.204 region:rollup2
PREVIOUSLY AND ACTUALLY PUT

01:29:33.902 --> 01:29:38.139 region:rollup2
THAT TO GOOD USE WHICH IS.

01:29:36.204 --> 01:29:39.608 region:rollup2
I GROUND BANKING OR HELPING.

01:29:38.139 --> 01:29:42.143 region:rollup2
HELPING MUNICIPALITY OUR WATER

01:29:39.608 --> 01:29:43.912 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS WITH THEIR RECHARGE.

01:29:42.143 --> 01:29:44.679 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S NOT JUST ONLY IN THE

01:29:43.912 --> 01:29:45.881 region:rollup2
VALLEY BUT THAT'S EVEN THE

01:29:44.679 --> 01:29:46.982 region:rollup2
CENTRAL COAST WHERE THEY HAVE

01:29:45.881 --> 01:29:49.985 region:rollup2
THESE ISSUES.

01:29:46.982 --> 01:29:52.954 region:rollup2
ALONG THE BORDER AND EVEN THAT.

01:29:49.985 --> 01:29:53.154 region:rollup2
TOWARDS THE NEVADA BORDER AS

01:29:52.954 --> 01:29:54.890 region:rollup2
WELL.

01:29:53.154 --> 01:29:56.758 region:rollup2
.

01:29:54.890 --> 01:29:59.794 region:rollup2
SO.

01:29:56.758 --> 01:30:00.896 region:rollup2
MY FIRST OFF IS THAT.

01:29:59.794 --> 01:30:02.397 region:rollup2
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE AIMED AT

01:30:00.896 --> 01:30:03.398 region:rollup2
DOING.

01:30:02.397 --> 01:30:05.433 region:rollup2
WITH THIS LEGISLATION BECAUSE

01:30:03.398 --> 01:30:07.802 region:rollup2
ANOTHER WAS AMENDMENTS AND.

01:30:05.433 --> 01:30:08.603 region:rollup2
OUR UNDERSTANDING IS ANY MEDIUM

01:30:07.802 --> 01:30:12.474 region:rollup2
OR HIGH.

01:30:08.603 --> 01:30:14.075 region:rollup2
A OVER DRAFTED. THAT GSA WILL

01:30:12.474 --> 01:30:15.577 region:rollup2
HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BENEFIT

01:30:14.075 --> 01:30:15.977 region:rollup2
FROM THIS IN THOSE.

01:30:15.577 --> 01:30:18.546 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS OF HIGH

01:30:15.977 --> 01:30:20.849 region:rollup2
PRECIPITATION.

01:30:18.546 --> 01:30:23.018 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S ANY OVER DRAFTED OR

01:30:20.849 --> 01:30:24.653 region:rollup2
MEDIUM OVER DRAFTED THAT.

01:30:23.018 --> 01:30:25.820 region:rollup2
GSA THAT WOULD HAVE THE

01:30:24.653 --> 01:30:27.489 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL TO BE ABLE TO APPLY

01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:28.089 region:rollup2
FOR THE SENATE AND THAT'LL HELP

01:30:27.489 --> 01:30:28.923 region:rollup2
THEM MEET THEIR SINGLES THAT'S

01:30:28.089 --> 01:30:29.491 region:rollup2
GREAT.

01:30:28.923 --> 01:30:31.693 region:rollup2
OKAY.

01:30:29.491 --> 01:30:34.729 region:rollup2
I SEE THIS IS A GOOD MEASURE

01:30:31.693 --> 01:30:36.464 region:rollup2
I'LL HOME OF THE BILL.

01:30:34.729 --> 01:30:37.799 region:rollup2
IF WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND

01:30:36.464 --> 01:30:37.966 region:rollup2
WE DO HAVE. COLLEAGUE.

01:30:37.799 --> 01:30:39.901 region:rollup2
HI.

01:30:37.966 --> 01:30:41.336 region:rollup2
.

01:30:39.901 --> 01:30:42.404 region:rollup2
DEFINITELY I APPRECIATE WHAT

01:30:41.336 --> 01:30:43.905 region:rollup2
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AND IT MAKES

01:30:42.404 --> 01:30:45.874 region:rollup2
SENSE.

01:30:43.905 --> 01:30:47.208 region:rollup2
BUT UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITIES

01:30:45.874 --> 01:30:48.376 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WORKING

01:30:47.208 --> 01:30:50.211 region:rollup2
WITH EVERYONE BECAUSE THE WATER

01:30:48.376 --> 01:30:51.379 region:rollup2
IS FLOWING SOMEWHERE ELSE AND

01:30:50.211 --> 01:30:53.114 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES THOSE SOMEWHERE ELSE

01:30:51.379 --> 01:30:55.583 region:rollup2
PEOPLE. WANT ACCESS.

01:30:53.114 --> 01:30:57.319 region:rollup2
AND MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS THE

01:30:55.583 --> 01:30:59.554 region:rollup2
SEQUEL EXCEPTION.

01:30:57.319 --> 01:31:00.221 region:rollup2
GIVEN THAT THIS COULD.

01:30:59.554 --> 01:31:01.489 region:rollup2
DEPENDING ON WHERE THE WATER IS

01:31:00.221 --> 01:31:04.192 region:rollup2
FLOWING AND WHERE IT'S BEING

01:31:01.489 --> 01:31:06.928 region:rollup2
USED CONCERN ONLY IMPACT.

01:31:04.192 --> 01:31:08.563 region:rollup2
SOME OF OUR NATURAL AREAS AND

01:31:06.928 --> 01:31:09.731 region:rollup2
THEIR ABILITY TO HAVE WATER.

01:31:08.563 --> 01:31:10.231 region:rollup2
IN ECO SYSTEMS THAT ARE

01:31:09.731 --> 01:31:12.067 region:rollup2
DESIGNED FOR OCCASIONAL

01:31:10.231 --> 01:31:12.834 region:rollup2
FLOODING.

01:31:12.067 --> 01:31:14.636 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW OF COURSE WE

01:31:12.834 --> 01:31:16.438 region:rollup2
RESTRICT THAT.

01:31:14.636 --> 01:31:18.606 region:rollup2
THEN THAT CAN DISTURB THOSE ECO

01:31:16.438 --> 01:31:20.775 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS AND I'M WONDERING IF HOW

01:31:18.606 --> 01:31:23.311 region:rollup2
A AND ONE OF THE ARM. A.

01:31:20.775 --> 01:31:24.646 region:rollup2
GENTLEMAN WHO SPOKE ARM ALLUDED

01:31:23.311 --> 01:31:26.147 region:rollup2
TO THIS IF THERE ARE WAYS OF

01:31:24.646 --> 01:31:27.182 region:rollup2
DOING SECRET EXEMPTIONS IN

01:31:26.147 --> 01:31:28.984 region:rollup2
ADVANCE FOR SOME OF THE MORE

01:31:27.182 --> 01:31:31.019 region:rollup2
SENSITIVE AREAS AND AREAS THAT

01:31:28.984 --> 01:31:32.787 region:rollup2
WE KNOW ARE SUBJECT TO PERIODIC

01:31:31.019 --> 01:31:34.756 region:rollup2
FLOODING. SO THAT YOU HAVE THOSE

01:31:32.787 --> 01:31:36.691 region:rollup2
SEQUEL OUT DOCUMENTS ARE KIND OF

01:31:34.756 --> 01:31:38.727 region:rollup2
AT THE READY WHEN THAT TIME

01:31:36.691 --> 01:31:40.362 region:rollup2
COMES OR EVEN THE APPROVAL STEIN

01:31:38.727 --> 01:31:41.563 region:rollup2
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE

01:31:40.362 --> 01:31:43.698 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED WITH YOUR AMENDMENTS.

01:31:41.563 --> 01:31:45.266 region:rollup2
I'M HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO

01:31:43.698 --> 01:31:47.035 region:rollup2
CONSIDER THINGS AS WORK GOING

01:31:45.266 --> 01:31:49.003 region:rollup2
FORWARD BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS

01:31:47.035 --> 01:31:50.839 region:rollup2
THAT THE TEMPORARY PERMITS GIVEN

01:31:49.003 --> 01:31:52.841 region:rollup2
BY THAT STATE WATER.

01:31:50.839 --> 01:31:54.843 region:rollup2
RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD CAN BE

01:31:52.841 --> 01:31:56.911 region:rollup2
THAT MECHANISM TO ENSURE THAT

01:31:54.843 --> 01:31:58.713 region:rollup2
WERE SENDING WATERS TO AREAS

01:31:56.911 --> 01:32:00.749 region:rollup2
THAT ARE MORE. ENVIRONMENTALLY

01:31:58.713 --> 01:32:02.984 region:rollup2
READY TO RECEIVE THEM

01:32:00.749 --> 01:32:05.220 region:rollup2
MY STRUGGLE THUS FAR GOING

01:32:02.984 --> 01:32:07.522 region:rollup2
FORWARD HAS BEEN THAT SEQUEL BY

01:32:05.220 --> 01:32:10.158 region:rollup2
ITS NATURE MAY PRO. THE PERIOD

01:32:07.522 --> 01:32:12.260 region:rollup2
BEFORE WE CAN APPLY THESE WATERS

01:32:10.158 --> 01:32:13.461 region:rollup2
AND WE MAY MISS OUR WINDOW OF

01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:14.529 region:rollup2
HAVING ACCESS ON USED WATER

01:32:13.461 --> 01:32:15.930 region:rollup2
RIGHT THAT'S WHY I'M WONDERING

01:32:14.529 --> 01:32:17.499 region:rollup2
WHETHER THOSE THOSE AREN'T

01:32:15.930 --> 01:32:20.201 region:rollup2
EVALUATIONS CAN BE DONE IN

01:32:17.499 --> 01:32:20.969 region:rollup2
ADVANCE OF THE. FLOOD EVENT SO

01:32:20.201 --> 01:32:22.737 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:32:20.969 --> 01:32:24.272 region:rollup2
WHEN CERTAIN FLOODING HAPPENS

01:32:22.737 --> 01:32:25.874 region:rollup2
IN CERTAIN AREAS YOU PRETTY MUCH

01:32:24.272 --> 01:32:27.075 region:rollup2
KNOW I WOULD THINK BY NOW WHERE

01:32:25.874 --> 01:32:28.443 region:rollup2
MOST OF THE WHERE A LOT OF THE

01:32:27.075 --> 01:32:29.778 region:rollup2
WATER'S GOING WOULD HAVE GONE.

01:32:28.443 --> 01:32:31.179 region:rollup2
AND WHERE THE FLOODING IS MORE

01:32:29.778 --> 01:32:33.348 region:rollup2
LIKELY TO HAPPEN BECAUSE YOU'VE

01:32:31.179 --> 01:32:34.783 region:rollup2
HAD SO MANY PAST EVENTS OF DOING

01:32:33.348 --> 01:32:37.385 region:rollup2
THE SEQUENT ALICE'S IN ADVANCE

01:32:34.783 --> 01:32:38.953 region:rollup2
AND LOOKING AT WHAT DIFFERENT.

01:32:37.385 --> 01:32:40.288 region:rollup2
KIND OF TAKES OF THAT WATER ON

01:32:38.953 --> 01:32:41.723 region:rollup2
WHAT KIND OF AN IMPACT THEY

01:32:40.288 --> 01:32:42.791 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE RATHER THAN TRY TO DO

01:32:41.723 --> 01:32:44.726 region:rollup2
THEM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOD

01:32:42.791 --> 01:32:46.261 region:rollup2
EVENT I AGREE.

01:32:44.726 --> 01:32:47.495 region:rollup2
THOSE TEMPORARY ORDERS

01:32:46.261 --> 01:32:48.696 region:rollup2
DID THEY HAVE SOME SORT OF

01:32:47.495 --> 01:32:49.931 region:rollup2
SEQUEL ANALYSIS IN THEM OR WHERE

01:32:48.696 --> 01:32:51.533 region:rollup2
THAT WAS PART OF THE ORDER TO

01:32:49.931 --> 01:32:52.934 region:rollup2
SAY WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO A

01:32:51.533 --> 01:32:53.935 region:rollup2
SEQUEL ANALYSIS BECAUSE WE'RE.

01:32:52.934 --> 01:32:56.371 region:rollup2
ARE IN THIS EXTRAORDINARY.

01:32:53.935 --> 01:32:59.441 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCE.

01:32:56.371 --> 01:33:01.943 region:rollup2
THE ONLY EVIDENCE THAT.

01:32:59.441 --> 01:33:03.511 region:rollup2
OUR OUR PROJECT.

01:33:01.943 --> 01:33:03.912 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON A

01:33:03.511 --> 01:33:05.580 region:rollup2
LARGE PROJECT ANY?

01:33:03.912 --> 01:33:07.015 region:rollup2
?

01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:08.817 region:rollup2
WE WE RECEIVED A FIVE MILLION

01:33:07.015 --> 01:33:10.418 region:rollup2
DOLLAR GRANT FROM IDW AND WHEN I

01:33:08.817 --> 01:33:11.152 region:rollup2
SAY WE.

01:33:10.418 --> 01:33:13.555 region:rollup2
THE KINGS RIVER CONSERVATION

01:33:11.152 --> 01:33:16.391 region:rollup2
DISTRICT.

01:33:13.555 --> 01:33:18.026 region:rollup2
WE HAVE WE HAVE SPENT AND

01:33:16.391 --> 01:33:18.593 region:rollup2
I'M GODLY AMOUNT OF TIME.

01:33:18.026 --> 01:33:20.795 region:rollup2
DOING AGREEMENTS DOING SEEK

01:33:18.593 --> 01:33:22.864 region:rollup2
WERE.

01:33:20.795 --> 01:33:25.166 region:rollup2
FOR OUR PROJECT OUR PROJECT IT

01:33:22.864 --> 01:33:26.334 region:rollup2
WAS A FLOOD WATER CORDER PROJECT

01:33:25.166 --> 01:33:28.736 region:rollup2
THAT WE TURNED INTO A GROUND

01:33:26.334 --> 01:33:30.672 region:rollup2
WATER RECHARGE PROJECT.

01:33:28.736 --> 01:33:31.806 region:rollup2
IT'S BEING FUNDED TO PREVENT

01:33:30.672 --> 01:33:33.341 region:rollup2
FLOODING DOWNSTREAM.

01:33:31.806 --> 01:33:35.009 region:rollup2
.

01:33:33.341 --> 01:33:35.810 region:rollup2
I KNOW THAT I'VE TALKED TO OTHER

01:33:35.009 --> 01:33:38.346 region:rollup2
GSA'S.

01:33:35.810 --> 01:33:40.048 region:rollup2
I'M THE CHAIRMAN FOR THE GSA IN

01:33:38.346 --> 01:33:42.250 region:rollup2
THE REGION I FARM.

01:33:40.048 --> 01:33:44.853 region:rollup2
AND POPULAR TALK OF POSSIBLY

01:33:42.250 --> 01:33:45.420 region:rollup2
DOING A. PAPER EITHER BASIN Y.

01:33:44.853 --> 01:33:49.257 region:rollup2
GSA PARA SEQUEL DOCUMENT ORI

01:33:45.420 --> 01:33:51.826 region:rollup2
GSA.

01:33:49.257 --> 01:33:52.427 region:rollup2
SECRET DOCUMENT.

01:33:51.826 --> 01:33:54.295 region:rollup2
SO WE DON'T HAVE THESE ISSUES

01:33:52.427 --> 01:33:55.730 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:33:54.295 --> 01:33:57.932 region:rollup2
I'M NOT SURE IF THE IN THE

01:33:55.730 --> 01:33:59.834 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY OF PERMITTING IF THERE

01:33:57.932 --> 01:34:02.437 region:rollup2
WAS IF THE QUOTE WAS PART OF

01:33:59.834 --> 01:34:03.505 region:rollup2
THAT ITEM. THAT'S NOT IT TO.

01:34:02.437 --> 01:34:05.106 region:rollup2
FIGHT THE IN THE GOVERNOR'S

01:34:03.505 --> 01:34:06.174 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY DECLARATIONS SEEK

01:34:05.106 --> 01:34:08.676 region:rollup2
THERE WAS AN EXEMPTION FROM

01:34:06.174 --> 01:34:10.945 region:rollup2
SEQUEL SO WHERE DID THOSE THOSE

01:34:08.676 --> 01:34:12.514 region:rollup2
TWO. PA TEMPORARY RIGHTS PERMITS

01:34:10.945 --> 01:34:14.482 region:rollup2
THAT WERE GRANTED SO FAR AT

01:34:12.514 --> 01:34:18.153 region:rollup2
LEAST UNDER THAT PROVISION BOTH

01:34:14.482 --> 01:34:18.786 region:rollup2
WERE. EXEMPTED FROM SEQUEL.

01:34:18.153 --> 01:34:20.188 region:rollup2
US SO THAT'S BUT THAT'S THE WAY

01:34:18.786 --> 01:34:21.723 region:rollup2
THAT IT CURRENTLY STANDS IN THE

01:34:20.188 --> 01:34:23.892 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE.

01:34:21.723 --> 01:34:26.261 region:rollup2
BUT LIKE I SAID BEFORE HIGH I

01:34:23.892 --> 01:34:26.694 region:rollup2
MEAN OUR ORGANIZATION AT LEAST

01:34:26.261 --> 01:34:27.629 region:rollup2
BELIEVES THAT THAT.

01:34:26.694 --> 01:34:28.763 region:rollup2
.

01:34:27.629 --> 01:34:30.131 region:rollup2
WE OUR ENVIRONMENTAL

01:34:28.763 --> 01:34:31.666 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION I MEAN THAT'S

01:34:30.131 --> 01:34:33.101 region:rollup2
THAT'S OUR CONCERNS SO WE

01:34:31.666 --> 01:34:34.602 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO SEE

01:34:33.101 --> 01:34:35.570 region:rollup2
THESE PROJECTS GO FORWARD DE PUT

01:34:34.602 --> 01:34:37.438 region:rollup2
TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE

01:34:35.570 --> 01:34:39.440 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT BUT. SOME KIND OF A

01:34:37.438 --> 01:34:40.608 region:rollup2
PROGRAMMATIC DOCUMENT OR SOME

01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:42.043 region:rollup2
OTHER APPROACH TO SEEK WITH THAT

01:34:40.608 --> 01:34:43.745 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO WHAT YOU'RE

01:34:42.043 --> 01:34:47.615 region:rollup2
YOU'RE SUGGESTING. TERMS OF

01:34:43.745 --> 01:34:50.618 region:rollup2
CREATE ADVANCE ANALYSIS SO THAT.

01:34:47.615 --> 01:34:52.220 region:rollup2
WHEN THE ACTUAL OF EVENTS OCCUR

01:34:50.618 --> 01:34:54.556 region:rollup2
YOU CAN JUST MOVE ON THE THAT

01:34:52.220 --> 01:34:55.823 region:rollup2
WOULD BE MY STRONG SUGGESTION

01:34:54.556 --> 01:34:58.092 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I'M NOT COMFORTABLE.

01:34:55.823 --> 01:34:59.827 region:rollup2
A VOTING ON DOING.

01:34:58.092 --> 01:35:01.396 region:rollup2
SEQUEL EXEMPTION SORT OF A QUID

01:34:59.827 --> 01:35:03.064 region:rollup2
UNIFORMLY ACROSS THE BOARD IN

01:35:01.396 --> 01:35:04.465 region:rollup2
MANY DIFFERENT LOCATIONS WHERE

01:35:03.064 --> 01:35:05.033 region:rollup2
PEOPLE MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE DONE

01:35:04.465 --> 01:35:06.200 region:rollup2
THIS KIND OF ANALYSIS IN THE

01:35:05.033 --> 01:35:07.669 region:rollup2
PAST.

01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:11.005 region:rollup2
AND IT SEEMS REASONABLE.

01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:13.775 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE HIGH PROPENSITY FOR

01:35:11.005 --> 01:35:13.775 region:rollup2
FLOODING IN CERTAIN AREAS WHICH

01:35:13.841 --> 01:35:17.178 region:rollup2
MANY WILL BE KNOWN. SO YOU COULD

01:35:15.910 --> 01:35:18.713 region:rollup2
DO THOSE SORTS OF PROGRAMMATIC

01:35:17.178 --> 01:35:20.315 region:rollup2
HERE OURS IN THE DIFFERENT AREAS

01:35:18.713 --> 01:35:22.217 region:rollup2
THAT I INTEND TO. MAKE

01:35:20.315 --> 01:35:22.483 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES.

01:35:22.217 --> 01:35:23.585 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

01:35:22.483 --> 01:35:24.886 region:rollup2
.

01:35:23.585 --> 01:35:26.120 region:rollup2
THEY'LL THEMSELVES OF THE

01:35:24.886 --> 01:35:28.022 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION SO THAT WOULD BE MY

01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:30.592 region:rollup2
SUGGESTION AND I'M HAPPY TO

01:35:28.022 --> 01:35:32.894 region:rollup2
CONSIDER. ANY POTENTIAL THINGS

01:35:30.592 --> 01:35:34.963 region:rollup2
AS WE GO FORWARD. OUR ATTEMPT

01:35:32.894 --> 01:35:37.165 region:rollup2
WAS REALLY TO PROVIDE AN URGENCY

01:35:34.963 --> 01:35:38.633 region:rollup2
TO THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE

01:35:37.165 --> 01:35:40.969 region:rollup2
ORDER AND TO TRY TO CODIFY. AND

01:35:38.633 --> 01:35:42.637 region:rollup2
SO WE STARTED WITH WHAT HE HAD

01:35:40.969 --> 01:35:44.572 region:rollup2
DONE RIGHT TO MOVE THIS

01:35:42.637 --> 01:35:45.306 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION BUT I'M HAPPY TO

01:35:44.572 --> 01:35:46.874 region:rollup2
ENGAGE AS I WAS PROCESS

01:35:45.306 --> 01:35:47.976 region:rollup2
CONTINUES RIGHT I UNDERSTAND I

01:35:46.874 --> 01:35:49.277 region:rollup2
MEAN HE WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF AN

01:35:47.976 --> 01:35:50.078 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY AND HE WAS RESPONDING

01:35:49.277 --> 01:35:51.879 region:rollup2
BUT WE'RE NOT THE MIDDLE OF

01:35:50.078 --> 01:35:53.414 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY NOW SO WE. HAVE TIME

01:35:51.879 --> 01:35:55.717 region:rollup2
TO ASK THE AGENCIES TO START

01:35:53.414 --> 01:35:56.918 region:rollup2
DOING SOME OF THIS WORK GOING

01:35:55.717 --> 01:35:59.153 region:rollup2
FORWARD I WOULD THINK.

01:35:56.918 --> 01:36:00.455 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT YOU WOULD GET A

01:35:59.153 --> 01:36:02.257 region:rollup2
LOT MORE SUPPORT FROM THE

01:36:00.455 --> 01:36:03.891 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY IF THAT

01:36:02.257 --> 01:36:06.060 region:rollup2
IF AT LEAST THAT SAFETY MEASURE.

01:36:03.891 --> 01:36:06.361 region:rollup2
WAS ANTICIPATED AND HAVE PUT

01:36:06.060 --> 01:36:07.729 region:rollup2
INTO PLACE.

01:36:06.361 --> 01:36:10.131 region:rollup2
IN ADVANCE

01:36:07.729 --> 01:36:11.599 region:rollup2
SO. I WILL SUPPORT THIS TODAY

01:36:10.131 --> 01:36:13.167 region:rollup2
BUT I RESERVE THE RIGHT YOU KNOW

01:36:11.599 --> 01:36:14.102 region:rollup2
IS I SEE I I'M VERY GLAD TO SEE

01:36:13.167 --> 01:36:15.136 region:rollup2
THAT YOU ARE WORKING WITH ALL

01:36:14.102 --> 01:36:16.738 region:rollup2
THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS AND

01:36:15.136 --> 01:36:18.539 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY THE DOWN HOLD. WATER

01:36:16.738 --> 01:36:19.607 region:rollup2
WATER RATES YOU KNOW AND THEIR

01:36:18.539 --> 01:36:20.508 region:rollup2
CONCERNS AND I.

01:36:19.607 --> 01:36:21.643 region:rollup2
JUST WANTED TO PUT IT IN YOUR

01:36:20.508 --> 01:36:23.611 region:rollup2
BRAIN THAT THIS WAS MY

01:36:21.643 --> 01:36:24.879 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR CONCERN AND SO WHEN

01:36:23.611 --> 01:36:25.780 region:rollup2
IT COMES TO A VOTE ON THE FLOOR

01:36:24.879 --> 01:36:27.348 region:rollup2
I'LL CERTAINLY BE LOOKING TO SEE

01:36:25.780 --> 01:36:28.616 region:rollup2
WHAT WORK WAS DONE IN THIS AREA.

01:36:27.348 --> 01:36:30.551 region:rollup2
THINK IT THANK YOU THINKING WE

01:36:28.616 --> 01:36:31.886 region:rollup2
HAVE A QUESTION FROM MISTER

01:36:30.551 --> 01:36:33.721 region:rollup2
BIGELOW FOLLOWED BY MISTER

01:36:31.886 --> 01:36:33.988 region:rollup2
AGAINST YOU.

01:36:33.721 --> 01:36:36.391 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:36:33.988 --> 01:36:37.759 region:rollup2
TO THE AUTHOR.

01:36:36.391 --> 01:36:39.827 region:rollup2
WHEN WE LOOK BACK AT LAST YEAR

01:36:37.759 --> 01:36:40.695 region:rollup2
NGUYEN NON.

01:36:39.827 --> 01:36:40.928 region:rollup2
IT'S FORTY SEVEN BILL WENT

01:36:40.695 --> 01:36:42.830 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

01:36:40.928 --> 01:36:44.532 region:rollup2
.

01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:46.234 region:rollup2
I ACTUALLY TOOK A POSITION OF OF

01:36:44.532 --> 01:36:48.369 region:rollup2
A NOT VOTING ON THAT. TO GIVE AN

01:36:46.234 --> 01:36:50.271 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE ON

01:36:48.369 --> 01:36:50.972 region:rollup2
WITHOUT WEIGHING AND WITH YASSER

01:36:50.271 --> 01:36:52.040 region:rollup2
NOW.

01:36:50.972 --> 01:36:54.475 region:rollup2
ONE OF THAT.

01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:55.443 region:rollup2
GOOD PARTS OF HER BILL WHICH IS

01:36:54.475 --> 01:36:56.044 region:rollup2
THE PART THAT

01:36:55.443 --> 01:36:57.211 region:rollup2
I HAVEN'T SEEN IN YOUR BILL AT

01:36:56.044 --> 01:36:59.681 region:rollup2
THIS.

01:36:57.211 --> 01:37:00.948 region:rollup2
TIME WAS THE ABILITY TO PROTECT.

01:36:59.681 --> 01:37:02.517 region:rollup2
THE DOWNSTREAM USERS AND THE

01:37:00.948 --> 01:37:05.586 region:rollup2
WATER RIGHTS.

01:37:02.517 --> 01:37:07.388 region:rollup2
OF FOLKS WHO WERE. ESSENTIALLY

01:37:05.586 --> 01:37:09.490 region:rollup2
PROTECTED.

01:37:07.388 --> 01:37:11.159 region:rollup2
ARE YOU HAVING HEARD A LITTLE

01:37:09.490 --> 01:37:12.193 region:rollup2
BIT OF YOUR DISCUSSION TODAY YOU

01:37:11.159 --> 01:37:14.162 region:rollup2
SPOKE DIRECTLY ABOUT.

01:37:12.193 --> 01:37:15.663 region:rollup2
THE FLOOD FLOWS.

01:37:14.162 --> 01:37:17.832 region:rollup2
AND SO THERE'S A DISTINGUISHING

01:37:15.663 --> 01:37:18.733 region:rollup2
COMPONENT BETWEEN PROTECTING THE

01:37:17.832 --> 01:37:19.701 region:rollup2
SENIOR WATER RIGHTS IN THE

01:37:18.733 --> 01:37:21.002 region:rollup2
JUNIOR WATER RIGHTS AND THE

01:37:19.701 --> 01:37:22.437 region:rollup2
FOLKS.

01:37:21.002 --> 01:37:24.072 region:rollup2
WHO WERE BASICALLY TRYING TO

01:37:22.437 --> 01:37:25.940 region:rollup2
UTILIZE?

01:37:24.072 --> 01:37:28.710 region:rollup2
NOT APPROPRIATE NOT.

01:37:25.940 --> 01:37:30.044 region:rollup2
RECEIVE OUR ADJUDICATE ANYWAY

01:37:28.710 --> 01:37:31.779 region:rollup2
BUT TO UTILIZE FLOOD FLOOD

01:37:30.044 --> 01:37:34.215 region:rollup2
WATERS.

01:37:31.779 --> 01:37:36.184 region:rollup2
IS YOUR BILL SINGULAR.

01:37:34.215 --> 01:37:37.485 region:rollup2
IN THAT IS ONLY TALKING TO.

01:37:36.184 --> 01:37:39.887 region:rollup2
THE.

01:37:37.485 --> 01:37:41.656 region:rollup2
FLOOD FLOWS.

01:37:39.887 --> 01:37:42.790 region:rollup2
AND WOULD YOUR BILL AND AS IT

01:37:41.656 --> 01:37:43.925 region:rollup2
MOVES FORWARD WOULD YOU BE

01:37:42.790 --> 01:37:45.793 region:rollup2
AGREEABLE TO OUTLINING

01:37:43.925 --> 01:37:47.895 region:rollup2
PROTECTION.

01:37:45.793 --> 01:37:48.763 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC FOR THOSE SENIOR AND

01:37:47.895 --> 01:37:51.165 region:rollup2
JUNIOR WATER RIGHT HOLDERS.

01:37:48.763 --> 01:37:53.434 region:rollup2
YES.

01:37:51.165 --> 01:37:55.103 region:rollup2
SO I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO

01:37:53.434 --> 01:37:56.904 region:rollup2

THE FILTRATION SYSTEM IN A MORE

01:41:00.087 --> 01:41:02.857 region:rollup2
NATURAL BALLISTIC Y..

01:41:02.256 --> 01:41:03.925 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OBJECTION TIME TO GET

01:41:02.857 --> 01:41:05.893 region:rollup2

THAT ARE SIMILAR TO OURS HAVE NO

01:41:33.354 --> 01:41:37.825 region:rollup2

01:41:47.902 --> 01:41:52.540 region:rollup2
SO THAT THE REAL PROBLEM AND.

01:41:49.637 --> 01:41:54.909 region:rollup2

SO.

01:42:05.886 --> 01:42:10.491 region:rollup2
THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE FACED

01:42:06.454 --> 01:42:11.292 region:rollup2

UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR DISTRICT

01:42:15.529 --> 01:42:19.200 region:rollup2
BUT LET ME BEG THE QUESTION.

01:42:17.365 --> 01:42:20.768 region:rollup2
HOW DO YOU RECHARGE WHERE YOU

01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:22.336 region:rollup2

CHANNELER MOVE OTHER THAN

01:42:22.336 --> 01:42:25.773 region:rollup2
RAINFALL AND THAT'S A NATURAL

01:42:23.771 --> 01:42:27.775 region:rollup2
OCCURRENCE KNOW IF IF YOU HAVE

01:42:25.773 --> 01:42:28.876 region:rollup2
NO? SOURCE OF WATER IF YOU'RE

YOU'RE RIGHT YEAH YOU'RE ONLY.

01:42:31.412 --> 01:42:33.447 region:rollup2
THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GONNA BE

01:42:32.046 --> 01:42:35.282 region:rollup2
COMPLYING IS TO HAVE SOMEONE

01:42:33.447 --> 01:42:36.751 region:rollup2

ARE LINKED TOGETHER.

01:42:53.401 --> 01:42:56.270 region:rollup2
BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE ONE FILLED

01:42:54.435 --> 01:42:58.239 region:rollup2
BEFORE YOU CAN FILL THE OTHER.

01:42:56.270 --> 01:43:00.374 region:rollup2

UNDERSTANDING.

01:54:12.813 --> 01:54:16.450 region:rollup2
OUR INTENT WAS TO WORK THROUGH

01:54:14.781 --> 01:54:18.852 region:rollup2
THE COMMITTEE AND FIGURE OUT HOW

01:54:16.450 --> 01:54:20.954 region:rollup2
WE CAN RETURN A PARK IN ANY.

01:54:18.852 --> 01:54:22.556 region:rollup2
FASHION WE COULDN'T HONESTLY I

01:54:20.954 --> 01:54:24.191 region:rollup2
WAS QUITE PLEASED WITH THE

01:54:22.556 --> 01:54:25.125 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS AND HOW IT HAS BEEN

01:54:24.191 --> 01:54:27.094 region:rollup2
ABLE TO.

01:54:25.125 --> 01:54:29.496 region:rollup2
BRING EVERYONE INTO A SUPPORT

01:54:27.094 --> 01:54:29.696 region:rollup2
POSITION AND WILL CONTINUE TO

01:54:29.496 --> 01:54:32.199 region:rollup2
WORK.

01:54:29.696 --> 01:54:34.000 region:rollup2
IN THAT WAY AND AND AS THIS

01:54:32.199 --> 01:54:37.037 region:rollup2
MOVES FORWARD THE REQUEST OF THE

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:38.638 region:rollup2
BILL REALLY. IT KIND OF.

01:54:37.037 --> 01:54:40.373 region:rollup2
IT IT GETS US TO THE POINT WHERE

01:54:38.638 --> 01:54:41.441 region:rollup2
PEOPLE CAN TALK.

01:54:40.373 --> 01:54:43.977 region:rollup2
BUT THE REAL TALK REALLY

01:54:41.441 --> 01:54:45.946 region:rollup2
REVOLVES AROUND MONEY.

01:54:43.977 --> 01:54:47.881 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS HOLLOW AT THIS

01:54:45.946 --> 01:54:51.017 region:rollup2
MOMENT IT HAS NO MONEY.

01:54:47.881 --> 01:54:52.419 region:rollup2
AND IT HAS NO. OUR ABILITY TO

01:54:51.017 --> 01:54:54.221 region:rollup2
PUT THE TOOLS TOGETHER UNTIL WE

01:54:52.419 --> 01:54:56.156 region:rollup2
GET FUNDING.

01:54:54.221 --> 01:54:56.656 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT'S GONNA BE THE ART

01:54:56.156 --> 01:54:57.991 region:rollup2
OF THIS BILL AS IT MOVES

01:54:56.656 --> 01:54:59.426 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

01:54:57.991 --> 01:55:01.261 region:rollup2
WHERE'S THE FUNDING GONNA COME

01:54:59.426 --> 01:55:03.029 region:rollup2
FROM.

01:55:01.261 --> 01:55:04.097 region:rollup2
WHILE I SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY

01:55:03.029 --> 01:55:04.965 region:rollup2
AND WHEN ENCOURAGE EVERY MEMBER

01:55:04.097 --> 01:55:07.200 region:rollup2
AROUND THIS TABLE.

01:55:04.965 --> 01:55:08.502 region:rollup2
DISAPPOINTED.

01:55:07.200 --> 01:55:10.237 region:rollup2
I WOULD ALSO ASK EVERY MEMBER TO

01:55:08.502 --> 01:55:12.239 region:rollup2
STAND IN OPPOSITION IF IT'S

01:55:10.237 --> 01:55:14.875 region:rollup2
GONNA TAKE A DIME. OUT OF OUR

01:55:12.239 --> 01:55:16.443 region:rollup2
EXISTING STATE PARKS BUDGET.

01:55:14.875 --> 01:55:18.678 region:rollup2
ANDERSON BECAUSE THAT'S NOT A

01:55:16.443 --> 01:55:20.614 region:rollup2
GOOD PLACE FOR US TO BE. WE NEED

01:55:18.678 --> 01:55:21.748 region:rollup2
TO FIND NEW FUNDING.

01:55:20.614 --> 01:55:23.216 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S FUNDING

01:55:21.748 --> 01:55:24.684 region:rollup2
THAT'S CLEAN FUNDING THAT

01:55:23.216 --> 01:55:26.386 region:rollup2
DOESN'T GET TAKEN FROM ANY OTHER

01:55:24.684 --> 01:55:27.554 region:rollup2
SOURCES.

01:55:26.386 --> 01:55:29.156 region:rollup2
TO HELP FACILITATE MAKING THIS

01:55:27.554 --> 01:55:31.358 region:rollup2
HAPPEN.

01:55:29.156 --> 01:55:32.726 region:rollup2
WITH THAT SAID.

01:55:31.358 --> 01:55:34.194 region:rollup2
SURE I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE

SUCCESSFUL.

01:55:39.065 --> 01:55:41.034 region:rollup2
AND FOR THE PEOPLE AT THE LOCAL

01:55:39.699 --> 01:55:41.601 region:rollup2
LEVEL.

01:55:41.034 --> 01:55:43.036 region:rollup2
THIS IS GOING TO BE ANOTHER

01:55:41.601 --> 01:55:44.171 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE.

01:55:43.036 --> 01:55:46.173 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGE BETWEEN TWO

01:55:44.171 --> 01:55:48.141 region:rollup2
COUNTIES.

01:55:46.173 --> 01:55:49.376 region:rollup2
AND AND A CITY WHO HAS

01:55:48.141 --> 01:55:50.911 region:rollup2
GOVERNANCE CONTROLS.

01:55:49.376 --> 01:55:53.146 region:rollup2
OVER THE LAND

01:55:50.911 --> 01:55:53.980 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE PARKWAY.

01:55:53.146 --> 01:55:55.582 region:rollup2
THERE ARE CERTAIN TOOLS THAT

01:55:53.980 --> 01:55:56.750 region:rollup2
PRECLUDE THEM.

01:55:55.582 --> 01:55:58.485 region:rollup2
IN PARTICULAR IN NINETEEN NINETY

01:55:56.750 --> 01:55:59.986 region:rollup2
FOUR AGREEMENT THAT DOESN'T

01:55:58.485 --> 01:56:01.254 region:rollup2
ALLOW THEM TO DEVELOP.

01:55:59.986 --> 01:56:02.856 region:rollup2
THE PARKWAY FULLY UNTIL EVERY

01:56:01.254 --> 01:56:04.858 region:rollup2

01:56:02.856 --> 01:56:05.926 region:rollup2
ENVISIONED IS PURCHASED.

01:56:04.858 --> 01:56:07.594 region:rollup2
IT'S THE FIFTY NINE HUNDRED ACRE

01:56:05.926 --> 01:56:08.528 region:rollup2
TOTAL.

01:56:07.594 --> 01:56:09.963 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SEE THAT

01:56:08.528 --> 01:56:11.031 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:56:09.963 --> 01:56:12.299 region:rollup2
COMPONENT IS REMOVED AS A

01:56:11.031 --> 01:56:14.935 region:rollup2
BARRIER.

01:56:12.299 --> 01:56:16.870 region:rollup2
AND ALLOW THE PEOPLE.

01:56:14.935 --> 01:56:18.472 region:rollup2
IN THESE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THE

01:56:16.870 --> 01:56:20.740 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO NOW CONSTRUCT.

01:56:18.472 --> 01:56:21.875 region:rollup2
AN OPEN.

01:56:20.740 --> 01:56:23.543 region:rollup2
THE DOOR FOR PEOPLE TO GO OUT

01:56:21.875 --> 01:56:25.312 region:rollup2
NEUTRALIZE IT.

01:56:23.543 --> 01:56:27.747 region:rollup2
I KNOW MISS WEAVER.

01:56:25.312 --> 01:56:28.281 region:rollup2
A NO IS IT'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE

01:56:27.747 --> 01:56:30.951 region:rollup2
IT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR.

01:56:28.281 --> 01:56:32.452 region:rollup2
SINCE.

01:56:30.951 --> 01:56:34.521 region:rollup2

01:56:32.452 --> 01:56:36.523 region:rollup2
EARLY NINETIES.

01:56:34.521 --> 01:56:38.458 region:rollup2
THAT THIS WHOLE PROCESS BEGAN.

01:56:36.523 --> 01:56:39.493 region:rollup2
SO I WOULD STRONGLY ENCOURAGE

01:56:38.458 --> 01:56:41.561 region:rollup2
THOSE LOCALS TO GO BACK AND

01:56:39.493 --> 01:56:43.530 region:rollup2
REVIEW THOSE POLICIES.

01:56:41.561 --> 01:56:45.365 region:rollup2
AND WORK FORWARD.

01:56:43.530 --> 01:56:46.900 region:rollup2
IN DEVELOPING A MEANINGFUL TRAIL

01:56:45.365 --> 01:56:48.768 region:rollup2

01:56:46.900 --> 01:56:50.737 region:rollup2

FROM ONE TO THREE MILES AWAY.

01:56:50.737 --> 01:56:54.007 region:rollup2
TAKING YOUR LITTLE CHILD AND

01:56:52.305 --> 01:56:55.408 region:rollup2
SAYING A LOOK OVER THERE IS THE

01:56:54.007 --> 01:56:56.209 region:rollup2
SAN JOAQUIN RIVER.

01:56:55.408 --> 01:56:58.545 region:rollup2

01:57:02.983 --> 01:57:05.552 region:rollup2
EXIST ALONG THIS PARKWAY.

01:57:05.085 --> 01:57:07.320 region:rollup2
WOULD BE A MEANINGFUL

01:57:05.552 --> 01:57:08.855 region:rollup2

THEY'VE DONE TO THIS POINT.

01:57:13.226 --> 01:57:17.230 region:rollup2

ONE IS THAT.

02:05:45.138 --> 02:05:49.075 region:rollup2
THE.

02:05:46.939 --> 02:05:51.110 region:rollup2
PURPOSE OF THE PRESLEY PROGRAM

THE PROPERTIES.

02:06:13.099 --> 02:06:15.701 region:rollup2
OF THE OTHER PROBLEM WERE

02:06:14.700 --> 02:06:17.103 region:rollup2
CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE

02:06:15.701 --> 02:06:19.705 region:rollup2

THIS ACCOUNT.

02:06:34.687 --> 02:06:38.491 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD SEPARATE THE.

02:06:36.122 --> 02:06:40.593 region:rollup2
.

02:06:38.491 --> 02:06:41.727 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT PROGRAM FROM A

02:06:40.593 --> 02:06:43.463 region:rollup2

02:06:41.727 --> 02:06:46.132 region:rollup2
THAT MIGHT BE A POSSIBLE

02:06:43.463 --> 02:06:46.499 region:rollup2
SOLUTION. OF THE OTHER WOULD BE

02:06:46.132 --> 02:06:47.433 region:rollup2
TO SEEK ANOTHER.

02:06:46.499 --> 02:06:48.000 region:rollup2

THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS FLAG ONE

02:07:31.177 --> 02:07:34.080 region:rollup2
ISSUE WHICH IS.

02:07:32.812 --> 02:07:36.149 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY THE WELL THE WAY THE

02:07:34.080 --> 02:07:37.717 region:rollup2
BILL'S DRAFTED IS THAT IT WOULD

02:07:36.149 --> 02:07:39.185 region:rollup2
ALLOW FOR LANCE TACTIC

02:07:37.717 --> 02:07:40.520 region:rollup2
CHARACTERIZES LANDS THAT IT

02:07:39.185 --> 02:07:41.087 region:rollup2
WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS

02:07:40.520 --> 02:07:43.189 region:rollup2
FUNDING WOULD BE LAND THAT

02:07:41.087 --> 02:07:45.057 region:rollup2
INFALLIBLE. THAT'S MEANING NOT

02:07:43.189 --> 02:07:46.926 region:rollup2
PLANTED THAT YEAR WHEN IT'S THAN

02:07:45.057 --> 02:07:47.960 region:rollup2
BEING FLOODED UP THE CONCERN

02:07:46.926 --> 02:07:49.896 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE IS THAT.

02:07:47.960 --> 02:07:51.464 region:rollup2
THESE DOLLARS ARE VERY SCARCE

02:07:49.896 --> 02:07:52.999 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF

02:07:51.464 --> 02:07:54.200 region:rollup2
THE DOLLARS LANDS THAT HAVE NOT

02:07:52.999 --> 02:07:55.568 region:rollup2
BEEN PLANTED IN THAT HAVE BEEN

02:07:54.200 --> 02:07:56.936 region:rollup2
FOLLOWED AND THEN FLOODED.

02:07:55.568 --> 02:07:58.905 region:rollup2
REALLY PROVIDE VERY LITTLE

02:07:56.936 --> 02:08:00.506 region:rollup2
HABITAT VALUE IT IS THE VALUE OF

02:07:58.905 --> 02:08:01.240 region:rollup2
THE RICE THAT HAD BEEN PLANTED

02:08:00.506 --> 02:08:03.242 region:rollup2
THERE.

02:08:01.240 --> 02:08:04.610 region:rollup2
THAT REALLY PROVIDES AND THEN

02:08:03.242 --> 02:08:05.845 region:rollup2
THAT WHATEVER'S LEFT OVER THEN

02:08:04.610 --> 02:08:07.713 region:rollup2
FLOODED OUT THAT PROVIDES THE

02:08:05.845 --> 02:08:09.782 region:rollup2
REAL FOOD VALUE. AND SO WE WOULD

02:08:07.713 --> 02:08:11.717 region:rollup2
JUST URGE THAT IN THE PROCESS OF

02:08:09.782 --> 02:08:13.419 region:rollup2

PROGRAM WE FIND THAT TO BE A

02:08:38.311 --> 02:08:41.213 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAM.

02:08:39.645 --> 02:08:43.249 region:rollup2
AND EVER AGREED WITH THE

02:08:45.418 --> 02:08:49.822 region:rollup2
DRAFTING

02:08:47.653 --> 02:08:50.456 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE THAT CREATES THAT SOUND

02:08:49.822 --> 02:08:52.191 region:rollup2
FOR FIREWALL.

02:08:50.456 --> 02:08:54.627 region:rollup2
BETWEEN.

02:08:52.191 --> 02:08:56.229 region:rollup2

CONSERVATION THAT SUPPORT WINNER

02:09:02.001 --> 02:09:05.605 region:rollup2
FLOODED RICE. THAT THE MORE OF

02:09:04.036 --> 02:09:07.573 region:rollup2
US ASKING FOR MONIES FOR THESE

02:09:05.605 --> 02:09:09.308 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS PROBABLY THE BETTER FOR

02:09:07.573 --> 02:09:11.510 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM IN THE LONG RUN. AND

LEVEL HIGH AS WELL AS IN IN

02:09:14.146 --> 02:09:17.216 region:rollup2
OTHER AIR AREAS TO GET FUNDING

02:09:15.648 --> 02:09:18.651 region:rollup2
THAT WE BELIEVE THAT ULTIMATELY

02:09:17.216 --> 02:09:20.886 region:rollup2
WE CAN ENHANCE THE PRESLEY

02:09:18.651 --> 02:09:22.088 region:rollup2
PROGRAM OVERALL WITH

02:09:20.886 --> 02:09:23.389 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE FUNDING.

02:09:22.088 --> 02:09:24.924 region:rollup2
ON THE ISSUE OF THE FALLOW

02:09:23.389 --> 02:09:27.460 region:rollup2
GROUNDS

02:09:24.924 --> 02:09:29.161 region:rollup2
THE REASON WE'VE ADDED THIS IN

02:09:27.460 --> 02:09:30.062 region:rollup2
HERE IS FOR BOMB OUR FARMERS IN

02:09:29.161 --> 02:09:31.564 region:rollup2
THE INDUSTRY THAT GROW ORGANIC

02:09:30.062 --> 02:09:33.699 region:rollup2
RICE.

02:09:31.564 --> 02:09:35.468 region:rollup2
I THEY HAVE A CROP ROTATION IN

02:09:33.699 --> 02:09:37.903 region:rollup2
ABOUT EVERY THIRD YEAR THEY

02:09:35.468 --> 02:09:39.472 region:rollup2
LEAVE THEIR PROPERTY FALLOW FOR

02:09:37.903 --> 02:09:41.140 region:rollup2
THE PER THAT FOR THOSE PURPOSES

02:09:39.472 --> 02:09:42.975 region:rollup2
OF GROWING ORGANIC RICE TO

02:09:41.140 --> 02:09:44.510 region:rollup2
REGENERATE THE SOIL. AND SO WE

02:09:42.975 --> 02:09:46.112 region:rollup2
DID NOT WANT TO ELIMINATE THEM

02:09:44.510 --> 02:09:48.247 region:rollup2
FROM THE OPPORTUNITY WE KNOW

02:09:46.112 --> 02:09:49.582 region:rollup2
THAT THAT. THAT'S THOSE FIELDS

02:09:48.247 --> 02:09:51.884 region:rollup2
THAT DON'T HAVE A CURRENT

02:09:49.582 --> 02:09:53.953 region:rollup2
OUTCROP OF RICE ON IT ARE NOT AS

02:09:51.884 --> 02:09:55.254 region:rollup2
BENEFICIAL TO THE WATERFOWL. BUT

02:09:53.953 --> 02:09:56.188 region:rollup2
AGAIN WE DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE

02:09:55.254 --> 02:09:57.590 region:rollup2
OUR.

02:09:56.188 --> 02:09:59.058 region:rollup2
FARMERS OUT THERE THAT ARE

02:09:57.590 --> 02:09:59.925 region:rollup2
GROWING ORGANIC RICE OUT OF THIS

02:09:59.058 --> 02:10:01.827 region:rollup2
PROGRAM SO THAT'S THE ONLY

02:09:59.925 --> 02:10:02.395 region:rollup2
REASON THAT WE'VE ALLOWED FOR

02:10:01.827 --> 02:10:04.096 region:rollup2
THAT OPPORTUNITY.

02:18:58.430 --> 02:19:01.099 region:rollup2
WITH THE COMMITTEE WITH THE

02:18:59.565 --> 02:19:02.801 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS WHICH TO MAKE SOME

02:19:01.099 --> 02:19:03.035 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS TO THE BILL.

02:19:02.801 --> 02:19:04.102 region:rollup2
HOWEVER.

02:19:03.035 --> 02:19:05.604 region:rollup2
.

02:19:04.102 --> 02:19:07.139 region:rollup2
EVEN WITH THOSE AMENDMENTS WE

02:19:05.604 --> 02:19:08.507 region:rollup2
STILL ARE VERY CONCERNED WITH

02:19:07.139 --> 02:19:11.109 region:rollup2
WHAT THE BILL DOES.

02:19:08.507 --> 02:19:12.578 region:rollup2
FIRST THE BILL I BELIEVE IT'S

02:19:11.109 --> 02:19:14.446 region:rollup2
REALLY DIRECTED AT KIND OF

02:19:12.578 --> 02:19:16.849 region:rollup2
ADDRESS UNCERTAINTIES.

02:19:14.446 --> 02:19:19.051 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINTIES WITH THE PROCESS.

02:19:16.849 --> 02:19:20.385 region:rollup2
IN TRYING TO DETERMINE WHAT IS

02:19:19.051 --> 02:19:23.322 region:rollup2
A STREAM OR RIVER.

02:19:20.385 --> 02:19:25.023 region:rollup2
HYDRO GEO MORPHOLOGY IS A VERY

02:19:23.322 --> 02:19:26.992 region:rollup2
HE COMPLICATED SCIENCE

02:19:25.023 --> 02:19:28.660 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO

02:19:26.992 --> 02:19:30.329 region:rollup2
DO IS SORT OF PUT IN BLACK AND

02:19:28.660 --> 02:19:31.597 region:rollup2
WHITE TERMS HOW YOU DEFINE THE

02:19:30.329 --> 02:19:33.198 region:rollup2
STREET WHEN A RIVER. THAT'S

02:19:31.597 --> 02:19:34.733 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO TO.

02:19:33.198 --> 02:19:36.635 region:rollup2
IN PARTICULAR.

02:19:34.733 --> 02:19:38.403 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO DEFINITION THAT'S

02:19:36.635 --> 02:19:39.938 region:rollup2
BEING PRO PROVIDED BY THE NEW.

02:19:38.403 --> 02:19:41.907 region:rollup2
.

02:19:39.938 --> 02:19:42.708 region:rollup2
A DEFINITION ABOUT MAKING SURE

02:19:41.907 --> 02:19:44.343 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S A DEFINITE CHANNEL

02:19:42.708 --> 02:19:46.445 region:rollup2
OR QUARTERS

02:19:44.343 --> 02:19:48.046 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO DEFINITION OF WHAT IS

02:19:46.445 --> 02:19:49.781 region:rollup2
A NATURALLY OCCURRING BAD BANKER

02:19:48.046 --> 02:19:51.149 region:rollup2
CHANNEL. THERE'S NO DEFINITION

02:19:49.781 --> 02:19:53.085 region:rollup2
OF WHAT IS CONSIDERED A PRE

02:19:51.149 --> 02:19:54.353 region:rollup2
EXISTING RIVER SO I BELIEVE

02:19:53.085 --> 02:19:55.888 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY THAT THIS BILL WOULD

02:19:54.353 --> 02:19:56.989 region:rollup2
PROBABLY CREATE EVEN MORE

02:19:55.888 --> 02:19:58.790 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINTY.

02:19:56.989 --> 02:19:59.558 region:rollup2
WITH TO APARTMENT EFFICIENT Y.

02:19:58.790 --> 02:20:00.492 region:rollup2
LIFE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW

02:19:59.558 --> 02:20:02.160 region:rollup2
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE

02:20:00.492 --> 02:20:03.795 region:rollup2
ADMINISTERING THIS PROGRAM. THE

02:20:02.160 --> 02:20:06.031 region:rollup2
OTHER ISSUE I RAY I AM CONCERNED

02:20:03.795 --> 02:20:08.133 region:rollup2
ABOUT IS THAT A MY ORGANIZATION

02:20:06.031 --> 02:20:09.334 region:rollup2
A PARTICULAR WORKS IN THE DESERT

02:20:08.133 --> 02:20:11.870 region:rollup2
AND IN THE ARID.

02:20:09.334 --> 02:20:13.372 region:rollup2
LANDSCAPE OF A LOT OF TIMES

02:20:11.870 --> 02:20:15.107 region:rollup2
WHAT MAY THINK WHAT WHAT YOU

02:20:13.372 --> 02:20:16.675 region:rollup2
MIGHT THINK IS A RIVER THAT BY

02:20:15.107 --> 02:20:17.876 region:rollup2
DEFINITION OF A RIVER MAYBE UP

02:20:16.675 --> 02:20:19.077 region:rollup2
IN THE NORTH NORTHERN PART OF

02:20:17.876 --> 02:20:20.646 region:rollup2
THE STATE IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN

02:20:19.077 --> 02:20:22.281 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT IN THE

02:20:20.646 --> 02:20:23.282 region:rollup2
DRY. AIRED SYSTEM WHERE

02:20:22.281 --> 02:20:24.716 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES IF YOU'RE WALKING

02:20:23.282 --> 02:20:26.785 region:rollup2
ACROSS THAT AREA YOU DON'T EVEN

02:20:24.716 --> 02:20:29.121 region:rollup2
REALIZE YOU'RE WALKING THROUGH

02:20:26.785 --> 02:20:30.155 region:rollup2
WHAT IS A DRY DESERT WASH. UNTIL

02:20:29.121 --> 02:20:31.323 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW A YEAR OR TWO LATER

02:20:30.155 --> 02:20:31.857 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU ACTUALLY OF RAIN YOU

02:20:31.323 --> 02:20:33.025 region:rollup2
HAVE WATER RUNNING THROUGH

02:20:31.857 --> 02:20:34.726 region:rollup2
THERE.

02:20:33.025 --> 02:20:37.396 region:rollup2
TO REQUIRE A DEFINITE BANK WOULD

02:20:34.726 --> 02:20:38.897 region:rollup2
PERHAPS LEAVE OUT HUGE PORTIONS

02:20:37.396 --> 02:20:40.299 region:rollup2
OF WHAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED A

02:20:38.897 --> 02:20:41.900 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD BE NORMALLY COVERED

02:20:40.299 --> 02:20:42.868 region:rollup2
UNDER THE STREAM THAT ALTERATION

02:20:41.900 --> 02:20:44.269 region:rollup2
JURISDICTION.

02:20:42.868 --> 02:20:46.204 region:rollup2
AND I'D I DON'T KNOW IF THAT

02:20:44.269 --> 02:20:47.572 region:rollup2
WAS AN INTENDED PART OF HOW THIS

02:20:46.204 --> 02:20:49.007 region:rollup2
DEFINITION WAS PUT TOGETHER BUT

02:20:47.572 --> 02:20:51.476 region:rollup2
THAT IS VERY MUCH LIKELY WILL BE

02:20:49.007 --> 02:20:54.980 region:rollup2
THE RESULT. MOVING FORWARD.

02:20:51.476 --> 02:20:58.050 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK MY SUGGESTION AS

02:20:54.980 --> 02:20:59.818 region:rollup2
THIS BILL. MOVES FORWARD IS THAT

02:20:58.050 --> 02:21:00.819 region:rollup2
FRANKLY THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT

02:20:59.818 --> 02:21:03.455 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE ADDRESSED THROUGH A

02:21:00.819 --> 02:21:04.022 region:rollup2
STE THE REGULATORY PROCESS BY

02:21:03.455 --> 02:21:05.924 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND

02:21:04.022 --> 02:21:07.759 region:rollup2
WILDLIFE. BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE

02:21:05.924 --> 02:21:09.628 region:rollup2
SOMETHING AS COMPLICATED AS

02:21:07.759 --> 02:21:11.897 region:rollup2
TRYING TO DEFINE USING THE

02:21:09.628 --> 02:21:13.432 region:rollup2
SCIENCE OF HYDROGEN MORPHOLOGY

02:21:11.897 --> 02:21:15.067 region:rollup2
AND ALL OF THE VARIATIONS WITHIN

02:21:13.432 --> 02:21:17.169 region:rollup2
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OF WHAT

02:21:15.067 --> 02:21:18.136 region:rollup2
IS A RIVER STREAM. THAT INS

02:21:17.169 --> 02:21:19.905 region:rollup2
ISN'T SOMETHING REALLY WITH THE

02:21:18.136 --> 02:21:21.573 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE IS SUPPOSED TO BE

02:21:19.905 --> 02:21:23.141 region:rollup2
CRAFTING THAT'S VERY DIFFICULT

02:21:21.573 --> 02:21:24.209 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT AND COMPLICATED A

02:21:23.141 --> 02:21:25.177 region:rollup2
DEFINITIONS IT SHOULD BE

02:21:24.209 --> 02:21:26.345 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT IS CONDUCTED

02:21:25.177 --> 02:21:27.946 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH

02:21:26.345 --> 02:21:29.481 region:rollup2
AND WILDLIFE IN THE REGULATORY

02:21:27.946 --> 02:21:31.316 region:rollup2
PROCESS. AND PERHAPS BECAUSE

02:21:29.481 --> 02:21:32.784 region:rollup2
THEY'VE NOT BEEN MOVING FORWARD

02:21:31.316 --> 02:21:34.186 region:rollup2
WITH REGULATIONS ON THIS ISSUE

02:21:32.784 --> 02:21:35.721 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS WHY WE FIND

02:21:34.186 --> 02:21:37.923 region:rollup2
OURSELVES IN HAVING THIS A

02:21:35.721 --> 02:21:39.691 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION. WITH THAT BEING SAID

02:21:37.923 --> 02:21:41.093 region:rollup2
I KNOW I WOULD URGE THAT THAT BE

02:21:39.691 --> 02:21:42.894 region:rollup2
MAYBE THE APPROACH TAKEN WITH

02:21:41.093 --> 02:21:44.062 region:rollup2
THE SPELL ON BUT AT THE VERY

02:21:42.894 --> 02:21:45.297 region:rollup2
MINIMUM WE LOOK FORWARD TO

02:21:44.062 --> 02:21:46.465 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OFFER

02:21:45.297 --> 02:21:48.500 region:rollup2
IN TRYING TO ADDRESS THESE

02:21:46.465 --> 02:21:50.302 region:rollup2
ISSUES. BECAUSE AGAIN THE POINT

02:21:48.500 --> 02:21:52.671 region:rollup2
OF THE STREAMBED ALTERATION

02:21:50.302 --> 02:21:53.271 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IS TO PROTECT FISH AND

02:21:52.671 --> 02:21:54.306 region:rollup2
WILDLIFE THAT IS THE POINT OF

02:21:53.271 --> 02:21:56.375 region:rollup2
IT.

02:21:54.306 --> 02:21:59.277 region:rollup2
IF THERE ARE PROJECTS THAT IMP

02:21:56.375 --> 02:22:01.480 region:rollup2
IN A. DIVERT OR IMPACT FLOW THE

02:21:59.277 --> 02:22:03.181 region:rollup2
AMOUNT QUALITY QUANTITY TIMING

02:22:01.480 --> 02:22:04.316 region:rollup2
OF WHEN WATER IS DELIVERED. IN

02:22:03.181 --> 02:22:05.617 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS THAT IS HAVING A

02:22:04.316 --> 02:22:07.886 region:rollup2
PROFOUND IMPACT ON THE FISH AND

02:22:05.617 --> 02:22:09.488 region:rollup2
WILDLIFE AND IT IS NOT A A

02:22:07.886 --> 02:22:10.889 region:rollup2
PROGRAM THAT IS JUST SIMPLY

02:22:09.488 --> 02:22:12.657 region:rollup2
THERE TO MAKE UP PROJECTS

02:22:10.889 --> 02:22:12.924 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED IS THERE TO SERVE A

02:22:12.657 --> 02:22:14.159 region:rollup2
PURPOSE.

02:22:12.924 --> 02:22:16.061 region:rollup2
SO WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE

02:22:14.159 --> 02:22:17.696 region:rollup2
THAT IN MOVING THIS BILL FORWARD

02:22:16.061 --> 02:22:19.064 region:rollup2
THAT IT ACTUALLY GETS OUT.

02:22:17.696 --> 02:22:20.298 region:rollup2
TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

02:22:19.064 --> 02:22:21.666 region:rollup2
PROTECTING THE FISH AND WILDLIFE

02:22:20.298 --> 02:22:25.137 region:rollup2

OF THE OPPOSITION.

02:22:58.403 --> 02:23:00.138 region:rollup2
YEAH I THINK GO A WAS GOING TO

02:22:59.438 --> 02:23:02.240 region:rollup2

02:23:00.138 --> 02:23:03.475 region:rollup2
THE CLOSE IF IT IF YOU WANT ME

02:23:02.240 --> 02:23:05.644 region:rollup2
TO DO IT NOW I CAN.

02:23:03.475 --> 02:23:08.046 region:rollup2
.

SO I THINK I CAN APPRECIATE THAT

02:23:08.046 --> 02:23:11.249 region:rollup2
WERE OPPOSITION IS COMING FROM

02:23:11.249 --> 02:23:13.718 region:rollup2
ON THURSDAY.

02:23:12.484 --> 02:23:15.153 region:rollup2
AND THEN THERE WAS A COMMITTEE

02:23:13.718 --> 02:23:15.787 region:rollup2
AMENDMENT THAT ADDRESSED

02:23:15.153 --> 02:23:18.457 region:rollup2
WILDLIFE.

02:23:15.787 --> 02:23:19.291 region:rollup2
WHICH I BELIEVE ADDRESSES A LOT

02:23:18.457 --> 02:23:21.393 region:rollup2
OF THE CONCERNS FROM OPPOSITION.

02:23:19.291 --> 02:23:23.095 region:rollup2
.

02:23:21.393 --> 02:23:24.362 region:rollup2
I I APPRECIATE WHAT'S BEING

02:23:23.095 --> 02:23:25.397 region:rollup2
BROUGHT UP ABOUT THERE IS A

02:23:24.362 --> 02:23:26.798 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT HAPPENS

02:23:25.397 --> 02:23:28.767 region:rollup2
ON THE DESERT AND WHAT HAPPENS

02:23:26.798 --> 02:23:30.102 region:rollup2
UP HERE IN THE NORTH ONE OF THE

02:23:28.767 --> 02:23:32.504 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS IN THE REASON FOR THIS

02:23:30.102 --> 02:23:34.039 region:rollup2
BILL. IS THAT A STUDY THAT WAS

02:23:32.504 --> 02:23:35.774 region:rollup2
CONDUCTED RELIEVED LARGELY

02:23:34.039 --> 02:23:38.643 region:rollup2
FOCUSED ON THE DESERT COMMUNITY

02:23:35.774 --> 02:23:39.711 region:rollup2
IS BEING YOU. HAS BEEN USED

02:23:38.643 --> 02:23:41.012 region:rollup2
UP HERE IN THE NORTH AND SO

02:23:39.711 --> 02:23:42.848 region:rollup2
THERE IS THIS UNCERTAINTY

02:23:41.012 --> 02:23:44.115 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE AREN'T MAKING THAT

02:23:42.848 --> 02:23:46.118 region:rollup2
DISTINCTION BETWEEN. SOME OF

02:23:44.115 --> 02:23:46.852 region:rollup2
THESE DIFFERENT AREAS.

02:23:46.118 --> 02:23:49.221 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE I WOULD VERY

02:23:46.852 --> 02:23:50.222 region:rollup2
RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE IS A AND I

02:23:49.221 --> 02:23:51.723 region:rollup2
THINK THIS IS SOMETHING FOR US

02:23:50.222 --> 02:23:53.692 region:rollup2
OF THE LEGISLATURE.

02:23:51.723 --> 02:23:55.494 region:rollup2
IS NO WE DON'T JUST LEAVE THIS

02:23:53.692 --> 02:23:57.129 region:rollup2
TO THE REGULATORY PROCESS

02:23:55.494 --> 02:23:57.629 region:rollup2
IT'S OUR JOB TO PASS LAW IT'S

02:23:57.129 --> 02:23:59.564 region:rollup2
OUR JOB TO ESTABLISH THE

02:23:57.629 --> 02:24:00.832 region:rollup2
STATUTE.

02:23:59.564 --> 02:24:01.867 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE AGENCY WILL

02:24:00.832 --> 02:24:03.135 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO DO SOME

02:24:01.867 --> 02:24:04.870 region:rollup2
FURTHER DEFINITION IN THEIR IN

02:24:03.135 --> 02:24:06.471 region:rollup2
THEIR REGULATIONS.

02:24:04.870 --> 02:24:08.373 region:rollup2
BUT WITHIN THE CONFINES OF WHAT

02:24:06.471 --> 02:24:10.675 region:rollup2
WE ESTABLISH.

02:24:08.373 --> 02:24:11.676 region:rollup2
IS THE LAW AND SO WE NEED TO

02:24:10.675 --> 02:24:13.445 region:rollup2
START DOING THAT AS A

02:24:11.676 --> 02:24:15.247 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE AGAIN INSANE WE ARE

02:24:13.445 --> 02:24:16.114 region:rollup2
THE ONES THAT ESTABLISH THAT.

02:24:15.247 --> 02:24:17.282 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE AGENCIES THAT YOU

02:24:16.114 --> 02:24:18.550 region:rollup2
KNOW DOESN'T THAT'S BACKWARD

02:24:17.282 --> 02:24:19.284 region:rollup2
PROCESS TO ME.

02:24:18.550 --> 02:24:21.019 region:rollup2
THAT WE SAID NO WE DON'T

02:24:19.284 --> 02:24:23.288 region:rollup2
LEGISLATE WE DISALLOW THE

02:24:21.019 --> 02:24:24.890 region:rollup2
REGULATORS TO PASS LAN IN AND

02:24:23.288 --> 02:24:27.492 region:rollup2
DEFINED THIS NO WE SHOULD.

02:24:24.890 --> 02:24:28.860 region:rollup2
DEFINE THOSE PARAMETERS BROADLY.

02:24:27.492 --> 02:24:30.829 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE REGULATORY

02:24:28.860 --> 02:24:32.230 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY DOES ITS JOB I WILL

02:24:30.829 --> 02:24:32.864 region:rollup2
SAY WE ARE WORKING WITH

02:24:32.230 --> 02:24:35.333 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE

02:24:32.864 --> 02:24:36.902 region:rollup2
HAVE ALREADY BEEN IN MEETINGS.

02:24:35.333 --> 02:24:39.104 region:rollup2
WITH THE DIRECTOR I WOULD VERY

02:24:36.902 --> 02:24:40.972 region:rollup2
MUCH OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS A MINT

02:24:39.104 --> 02:24:42.741 region:rollup2
ON LANGUAGE FROM THEM. I DON'T

02:24:40.972 --> 02:24:43.341 region:rollup2
THINK THIS IS THE FINAL PRODUCT

02:24:42.741 --> 02:24:45.477 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE

02:24:43.341 --> 02:24:47.746 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH A OPPOSITION ALL

02:24:45.477 --> 02:24:50.015 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED WITH THIS.

02:24:47.746 --> 02:24:52.083 region:rollup2
BUT IT IS NEEDED AND I THINK WE

02:24:50.015 --> 02:24:54.352 region:rollup2
NEED TO START HERE'S LEGISLATURE

02:24:52.083 --> 02:24:55.053 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHING NODE WHAT THE RULES

02:24:54.352 --> 02:24:56.955 region:rollup2
ARE SO THAT PEOPLE HAVE

02:24:55.053 --> 02:24:59.090 region:rollup2
CERTAINTY. AND SO I WOULD ASK

02:24:56.955 --> 02:25:00.692 region:rollup2
FOR YOUR SUPPORT. NOT YOU KNOW

02:24:59.090 --> 02:25:02.727 region:rollup2
THIS LEGISLATION MOVING FOR.

02:25:00.692 --> 02:25:05.363 region:rollup2
QUESTION FROM.

02:25:02.727 --> 02:25:07.332 region:rollup2
OKAY IT PLEASE.

02:25:05.363 --> 02:25:09.434 region:rollup2
I'M

02:25:07.332 --> 02:25:10.035 region:rollup2
I A. A DEFINITE APPRECIATE WHAT

02:25:09.434 --> 02:25:11.469 region:rollup2
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AND I CAN

02:25:10.035 --> 02:25:13.104 region:rollup2
SEE WHERE FOUND THE LACK OF

02:25:11.469 --> 02:25:14.973 region:rollup2
DEFINITION IS CAUSING A PROBLEM

02:25:13.104 --> 02:25:16.374 region:rollup2
FOR PEOPLE IN YOUR AREA. A BUT

02:25:14.973 --> 02:25:18.043 region:rollup2
TO ME THIS IS A BIT OF A ONE

02:25:16.374 --> 02:25:19.311 region:rollup2
SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH THAT

02:25:18.043 --> 02:25:21.012 region:rollup2
REALLY RUNS INTO PROLEMS ACROSS

02:25:19.311 --> 02:25:23.114 region:rollup2
THE STATE. AND I THINK THAT

02:25:21.012 --> 02:25:24.583 region:rollup2
WHERE AGENCIES TO DO A GOOD JOB

02:25:23.114 --> 02:25:25.150 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THE ROLE IS AND

02:25:24.583 --> 02:25:26.785 region:rollup2
YOU'RE RIGHT THAT WE CAN'T

02:25:25.150 --> 02:25:28.220 region:rollup2
DEFAULT TO THEM BUT WE ALSO CAN

02:25:26.785 --> 02:25:28.987 region:rollup2
GIVE THEM STRONG INSTRUCTION.

02:25:28.220 --> 02:25:30.755 region:rollup2
AND THE ONE THING THAT A

02:25:28.987 --> 02:25:33.024 region:rollup2
REGULATORY AGENCY HAS THE

02:25:30.755 --> 02:25:34.326 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY TO. HAVE DIFFERENT

02:25:33.024 --> 02:25:35.961 region:rollup2
TYPES OF SOLUTIONS

02:25:34.326 --> 02:25:36.595 region:rollup2
ARE FOR DIFFERENT AREAS AND TO

02:25:35.961 --> 02:25:38.129 region:rollup2
TREAT DIFFERENT AREAS

02:25:36.595 --> 02:25:39.731 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTLY SO I CAN'T SUPPORT A

02:25:38.129 --> 02:25:41.733 region:rollup2
ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH THAT

02:25:39.731 --> 02:25:44.703 region:rollup2
REDEFINES.

02:25:41.733 --> 02:25:46.204 region:rollup2
THINGS REALLY TO SUIT ONE AREA

02:25:44.703 --> 02:25:47.639 region:rollup2
WHERE IT CAN BE YOU KNOW I THINK

02:25:46.204 --> 02:25:49.874 region:rollup2
A REAL REAL PROBLEM IN OTHER

02:25:47.639 --> 02:25:51.543 region:rollup2

THE CENTRAL VALLEY JOINT VENTURE

02:27:49.661 --> 02:27:52.964 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN OF WHICH THE

02:27:51.763 --> 02:27:54.299 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE

02:27:52.964 --> 02:27:56.101 region:rollup2

SIGNATORIES TO.

02:27:57.702 --> 02:28:00.939 region:rollup2
I'M IT WOULD ESSENTIALLY DO TWO

02:27:59.871 --> 02:28:02.674 region:rollup2
THINGS IT WOULD STRENGTHEN A

02:28:00.939 --> 02:28:03.975 region:rollup2

IN THE WATER CODE.

02:28:03.975 --> 02:28:08.246 region:rollup2

BEEN MET.

02:28:16.821 --> 02:28:20.258 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS

02:28:18.256 --> 02:28:22.560 region:rollup2
NECESSARY BECAUSE THE EXISTING

02:28:20.258 --> 02:28:23.828 region:rollup2
LAW. HAS NOT WORKED WE HAD A

02:28:22.560 --> 02:28:25.363 region:rollup2

AS WAS ALSO MENTIONED ALSO

02:28:34.606 --> 02:28:38.309 region:rollup2
CREATES AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM THE

02:28:36.141 --> 02:28:39.844 region:rollup2
INCENTIVE PROGRAM IS BASED ON

02:28:38.309 --> 02:28:41.413 region:rollup2
THE CONSERVATION RESERVE PROGRAM

02:28:39.844 --> 02:28:42.981 region:rollup2
WHICH IS A FARM BILL PROGRAM

02:28:41.413 --> 02:28:45.150 region:rollup2
THAT HAS DONE WONDERFUL THINGS

02:28:42.981 --> 02:28:46.718 region:rollup2
FOR WATERFOWL AND OTHER BIRDS IN

02:28:45.150 --> 02:28:48.386 region:rollup2

02:31:59.944 --> 02:32:03.047 region:rollup2
UP OVER THE YEARS MANY THE

02:32:01.646 --> 02:32:04.682 region:rollup2
SIGNATORIES OF TO THE LETTER

02:32:03.047 --> 02:32:05.683 region:rollup2
HAVE IMPLEMENTED WATER TRANSFERS

02:32:04.682 --> 02:32:07.819 region:rollup2
IN CLOSE COORDINATION WITH THE

02:32:05.683 --> 02:32:09.253 region:rollup2
PURE ON GW ARE. AND HISTORICALLY

02:32:07.819 --> 02:32:10.588 region:rollup2
THOSE TWO AGENCIES HAVE NOT

02:32:09.253 --> 02:32:11.956 region:rollup2
ALLOWED ANY VEGETATION LANDS

02:32:10.588 --> 02:32:13.725 region:rollup2
FOLLOW TO PRODUCE WATER FOR

02:32:11.956 --> 02:32:15.360 region:rollup2
WATER TRANSFERS.

02:32:13.725 --> 02:32:16.761 region:rollup2
THE REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY IN

02:32:15.360 --> 02:32:18.529 region:rollup2
STILL IMPORT TODAY IT ACCURATE

02:32:16.761 --> 02:32:19.497 region:rollup2
ACCURATELY DETERMINE THE AMOUNT

02:32:18.529 --> 02:32:20.798 region:rollup2
OF WATER THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN

02:32:19.497 --> 02:32:22.133 region:rollup2
CONSUMED BY THE FOREGOING

02:32:20.798 --> 02:32:23.701 region:rollup2
FOREGONE CROP ABSENT THE WATER

02:32:22.133 --> 02:32:25.637 region:rollup2
TRANSFER.

02:32:23.701 --> 02:32:27.171 region:rollup2
LET ME EMPHASIZE HERE WE BELIEVE

02:32:25.637 --> 02:32:29.307 region:rollup2
THAT MAINTAINING USEFUL WATER

02:32:27.171 --> 02:32:31.042 region:rollup2
HAVE WILDLIFE HABITAT DOES NOT

02:32:29.307 --> 02:32:32.644 region:rollup2
HAVE TO BE. A INCOMPATIBLE WITH

02:32:31.042 --> 02:32:34.612 region:rollup2
WATER TRANSFERS.

02:32:32.644 --> 02:32:36.347 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THERE'S GOT TO BE AN

02:32:34.612 --> 02:32:37.915 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENT MADE UP

02:32:36.347 --> 02:32:39.083 region:rollup2
TO THE AMOUNT OF WATER ELIGIBLE

02:32:37.915 --> 02:32:41.052 region:rollup2
FOR THE TRANSFER TO ACCOUNT FOR

02:32:39.083 --> 02:32:43.521 region:rollup2
CONSUMPTIVE USE IS NECESSARY TO

02:32:41.052 --> 02:32:44.922 region:rollup2
MAIN HABITAT OR IDLE FARMLAND.

02:32:43.521 --> 02:32:46.491 region:rollup2
THE DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT

02:32:44.922 --> 02:32:48.326 region:rollup2
OF WATER ELIGIBLE FOR THE

02:32:46.491 --> 02:32:49.827 region:rollup2
TRANSFER MUST BE TRANSPARENT.

02:32:48.326 --> 02:32:50.895 region:rollup2
AND IT'S GOING TO PROBABLY BE A

02:32:49.827 --> 02:32:52.530 region:rollup2
COSTS FOR COMPLETING THE WATER

02:32:50.895 --> 02:32:54.632 region:rollup2
TRANSFER UNLESS OTHER FUNDS ARE

02:32:52.530 --> 02:32:56.501 region:rollup2
MADE AVAILABLE FOR THAT PURPOSE.

02:32:54.632 --> 02:32:58.970 region:rollup2
SO SINCE THE PASSAGE OF SB SEVEN

02:32:56.501 --> 02:33:00.805 region:rollup2
FORTY NINE BY SENATOR A LOS WALK

02:32:58.970 --> 02:33:02.740 region:rollup2
BACK IN TWENTY THIRTEEN. D. W.

02:33:00.805 --> 02:33:04.275 region:rollup2
R. HAS ALLOWED NON IRRIGATED

02:33:02.740 --> 02:33:06.444 region:rollup2
VEGETATION REMAIN ON THE FALLOW

02:33:04.275 --> 02:33:08.346 region:rollup2
LANDS IF THE LANDOWNER CAN

02:33:06.444 --> 02:33:10.014 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATESUCH VEGETATIONS NOT

02:33:08.346 --> 02:33:12.050 region:rollup2
CONSUMING TRANSFERRED WATER.

02:33:10.014 --> 02:33:13.518 region:rollup2
THIS APPROACH ALLOWS DWI TO

02:33:12.050 --> 02:33:15.520 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT LEGAL WATER USERS

02:33:13.518 --> 02:33:17.288 region:rollup2
ARE NOT NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY

02:33:15.520 --> 02:33:19.490 region:rollup2
ANY VEGETATION CONSUMING WATER

02:33:17.288 --> 02:33:20.758 region:rollup2
ON THAT FELLOW PLAN.

02:33:19.490 --> 02:33:22.326 region:rollup2
I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT UNDER

02:33:20.758 --> 02:33:24.362 region:rollup2
THE BILL OF FARMERS COULD BE

02:33:22.326 --> 02:33:26.397 region:rollup2
PAID BOTH TO ALLOW VEGETATION

02:33:24.362 --> 02:33:28.032 region:rollup2
REMAIN ON AYE THE LANDS AS WELL

02:33:26.397 --> 02:33:29.133 region:rollup2
AS REMOVING VEGETATION FROM AYE

02:33:28.032 --> 02:33:30.702 region:rollup2
THE LANCE REPLIED WATER TRANSFER

02:33:29.133 --> 02:33:31.869 region:rollup2
SUPPLIES.

02:33:30.702 --> 02:33:33.438 region:rollup2
THIS COULD VERY MUCH MAKE IT

02:33:31.869 --> 02:33:35.139 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT FOR D. W. ART AND

02:33:33.438 --> 02:33:36.874 region:rollup2
FORCES WATER TRANSFER RULES

02:33:35.139 --> 02:33:39.110 region:rollup2
SINCE A FARMER WANNA MAXIMIZE

02:33:36.874 --> 02:33:40.545 region:rollup2
BOTH FUNDING STREAMS. BY ARGUING

02:33:39.110 --> 02:33:41.079 region:rollup2
THAT ANY VEGETATION LEFT ON AYE

02:33:40.545 --> 02:33:43.381 region:rollup2
THE LANCE IS NOT CONSUMING

02:33:41.079 --> 02:33:44.849 region:rollup2
WATER.

02:33:43.381 --> 02:33:46.517 region:rollup2
SO WE BELIEVE THE EXISTING LAW

02:33:44.849 --> 02:33:47.885 region:rollup2
ALREADY STRIKES A BALANCE WHICH

02:33:46.517 --> 02:33:49.353 region:rollup2
IS IMPORTANT FOR ENCOURAGING

02:33:47.885 --> 02:33:50.955 region:rollup2
COVER CROPS AS WELL AS

02:33:49.353 --> 02:33:52.256 region:rollup2
PROTECTING WATER TRANSFERS. AND

02:33:50.955 --> 02:33:53.391 region:rollup2
THAT WAS THE COMPROMISE THAT WE

02:33:52.256 --> 02:33:54.926 region:rollup2
STRUCK ALONG WITH OTHER

02:33:53.391 --> 02:33:55.727 region:rollup2

THIRTEEN.

02:33:57.361 --> 02:34:00.665 region:rollup2
SADDAM MINIMUM WE WOULD ASK THAT

02:33:58.830 --> 02:34:02.433 region:rollup2
THE BILL BE REVISED TO ELIMINATE

02:34:00.665 --> 02:34:04.469 region:rollup2
ANY NEW REQUIREMENTS TO MAKE IT

02:34:02.433 --> 02:34:05.002 region:rollup2
MORE DIFFICULT TO FORGET OF YARD

02:34:04.469 --> 02:34:05.369 region:rollup2
FROM FORCES WATER TRANSFER

02:34:05.002 --> 02:34:07.839 region:rollup2

02:35:51.075 --> 02:35:54.078 region:rollup2
WHERE THERE WAS A TRANSFER.

02:35:52.677 --> 02:35:56.147 region:rollup2
AND OR TO KEEP THE VEGETATION

02:35:54.078 --> 02:35:57.648 region:rollup2
OFF YOU HAVE TO DO AERIAL SPRAYS

02:35:56.147 --> 02:35:59.617 region:rollup2
IN AN AERIAL SPRAY WAS DONE IN

02:35:57.648 --> 02:36:01.185 region:rollup2
WHICH ALL THE IT IS ACTUALLY THE

02:35:59.617 --> 02:36:02.887 region:rollup2
DELTA WINDS PICKED UP AND

02:36:01.185 --> 02:36:05.022 region:rollup2
CARRIED IT OVER ALL BUNCH OF.

02:36:02.887 --> 02:36:06.457 region:rollup2
OTHER CROPLAND AND SO THE AND

02:36:05.022 --> 02:36:08.159 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A HUGE LAWSUIT OVER

02:36:06.457 --> 02:36:09.760 region:rollup2
AND LIABILITIES SO.

02:36:08.159 --> 02:36:10.828 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

02:36:09.760 --> 02:36:12.096 region:rollup2
IT'S DIFFICULT TO KEEP THEM

02:36:10.828 --> 02:36:13.431 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY CLEAN IN THE FIRST

02:36:12.096 --> 02:36:15.099 region:rollup2
PLACE AND THERE'S SOME LIABILITY

02:36:13.431 --> 02:36:16.133 region:rollup2
CONCERNS.

02:36:15.099 --> 02:36:17.735 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO I THINK EVERYBODY

02:36:16.133 --> 02:36:19.837 region:rollup2
AGREES AND EVEN THE OPPOSITION

02:36:17.735 --> 02:36:21.205 region:rollup2
SAID WE WANT TO HAVE ACTUALLY IF

02:36:19.837 --> 02:36:22.907 region:rollup2
WE CAN DO NON IRRIGATED COVER

02:36:21.205 --> 02:36:24.275 region:rollup2
CROP ON THIS THAT'S ACTUALLY

02:36:22.907 --> 02:36:25.843 region:rollup2
BETTER FOR WILDLIFE.

02:36:24.275 --> 02:36:26.878 region:rollup2
THEN OBVIOUSLY THAT'S KIND OF

02:36:25.843 --> 02:36:28.646 region:rollup2
THE GOAL WE'RE TRYING TO GET AT

02:36:26.878 --> 02:36:30.348 region:rollup2
IS TO ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN HAVE

02:36:28.646 --> 02:36:31.649 region:rollup2
AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM IN PLACE.

02:36:30.348 --> 02:36:33.517 region:rollup2
SO THE LANDOWNERS DO THAT SO

02:36:31.649 --> 02:36:34.552 region:rollup2
EVEN MORE DROUGHT.

02:36:33.517 --> 02:36:36.354 region:rollup2
OR WERE HAVING TO DO WATER

02:36:34.552 --> 02:36:37.955 region:rollup2
TRANSFERS WE'RE STILL GONNA HAVE

02:36:36.354 --> 02:36:39.023 region:rollup2
THAT HABITAT THAT IS NEEDED BY

02:36:37.955 --> 02:36:40.891 region:rollup2
MIGRATORY.

02:36:39.023 --> 02:36:42.360 region:rollup2
WATER FELL AND I THINK THERE'S

02:36:40.891 --> 02:36:42.927 region:rollup2
A HAPPY BALANCE TO DO THAT I

02:36:42.360 --> 02:36:44.996 region:rollup2
THINK WHAT THEY'RE CONCERNED

02:36:42.927 --> 02:36:46.697 region:rollup2
ABOUT IS HOUSE THAT ACCOUNTED

02:36:44.996 --> 02:36:48.065 region:rollup2
FOR IF THERE'S ANY WATER LOST.

02:36:46.697 --> 02:36:49.467 region:rollup2
AN ARM AND I THINK I THINK WE

02:36:48.065 --> 02:36:51.903 region:rollup2
CAN DO THAT AND THAT'S WHAT WE

02:36:49.467 --> 02:36:53.271 region:rollup2
ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING. TO

02:36:51.903 --> 02:36:55.006 region:rollup2
THAT ISSUE AGAIN I'M NOT.

02:36:53.271 --> 02:36:55.940 region:rollup2
TOTALLY TIED TO JUSTICE LANGUAGE

02:36:55.006 --> 02:36:56.941 region:rollup2
AND I'LL BE WORKING WITH THEM

02:36:55.940 --> 02:36:58.776 region:rollup2
FEEL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE

02:36:56.941 --> 02:36:59.777 region:rollup2
WATER AGENCY YES AND MAKE SURE

02:36:58.776 --> 02:37:01.779 region:rollup2
THAT THEIR CONCERNS ARE

02:36:59.777 --> 02:37:03.180 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED AND. THEN I'LL BE ABLE

02:37:01.779 --> 02:37:04.415 region:rollup2
TO VOTE ON IT ON THE FLOOR AS

02:37:03.180 --> 02:37:06.517 region:rollup2
WELL SO.

02:37:04.415 --> 02:37:07.285 region:rollup2

02:38:13.250 --> 02:38:16.187 region:rollup2
FEEL WHEN I INITIALLY INTRODUCED

02:38:14.452 --> 02:38:17.922 region:rollup2
THIS BILL IS TRYING TO GET OUT.

02:38:16.187 --> 02:38:19.523 region:rollup2
A PROBLEM THAT THAT IT REALLY

02:38:17.922 --> 02:38:22.226 region:rollup2
WAS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE AFTERMATH

02:38:19.523 --> 02:38:23.728 region:rollup2
OF THE OROVILLE CRISIS.

02:38:22.226 --> 02:38:26.397 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS ESSENTIALLY THE.

02:38:23.728 --> 02:38:28.032 region:rollup2
THE SAME AGENCY RIGHT NOW THAT.

02:38:26.397 --> 02:38:29.333 region:rollup2
OPERATES AND MAINTAINS THE STATE

02:38:28.032 --> 02:38:30.968 region:rollup2
WATER PROJECT INCLUDING OROVILLE

02:38:29.333 --> 02:38:32.937 region:rollup2
DAM.

02:38:30.968 --> 02:38:34.939 region:rollup2
IS ALSO THE SAME AGENCY THAT

02:38:32.937 --> 02:38:36.974 region:rollup2
PROVIDES THE REGULATORY

02:38:34.939 --> 02:38:39.076 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT. OF PROVIDES

02:38:36.974 --> 02:38:41.612 region:rollup2
INSPECTIONS AND PROVIDES THE

02:38:39.076 --> 02:38:43.047 region:rollup2
FEEDBACK AND REGULATES.

02:38:41.612 --> 02:38:43.914 region:rollup2
THE ENTITY THAT'S OPERATING

02:38:43.047 --> 02:38:45.649 region:rollup2
THAT'S DEPARTMENT OF WATER

02:38:43.914 --> 02:38:47.618 region:rollup2
RESOURCES DEPARTMENT OF WATER

02:38:45.649 --> 02:38:49.687 region:rollup2
RESOURCES OPERATES.

02:38:47.618 --> 02:38:51.655 region:rollup2
A THE DAMS A MAINTAINS THEM AND

02:38:49.687 --> 02:38:54.625 region:rollup2
IN THEIR DIVISION OF DAM SAFETY

02:38:51.655 --> 02:38:56.861 region:rollup2
IS TASKED WITH THEN REGULATING.

02:38:54.625 --> 02:38:58.929 region:rollup2
HOW THAT OPERATION TO MAINTAIN

02:38:56.861 --> 02:39:00.164 region:rollup2
MAINTENANCE IS TAKING PLACE SO?

02:38:58.929 --> 02:39:01.599 region:rollup2
THE ORIGINAL INTENT HERE WAS TO

02:39:00.164 --> 02:39:03.768 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY TAKE DIVISION A DAM

02:39:01.599 --> 02:39:04.034 region:rollup2
SAFETY OUT OF THE W. ARE AND

02:39:03.768 --> 02:39:06.537 region:rollup2
MAKE IT.

02:39:04.034 --> 02:39:08.406 region:rollup2
AND PUTIT SEPARATED FROM

02:39:06.537 --> 02:39:09.140 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES.

02:39:08.406 --> 02:39:11.041 region:rollup2
AND BUT THE COMMITTEES

02:39:09.140 --> 02:39:12.743 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS.

02:39:11.041 --> 02:39:15.079 region:rollup2
WHICH HAVE BEEN PROPOSED I THINK

02:39:12.743 --> 02:39:17.481 region:rollup2
WOULD DO THE THE SAME THING.

02:39:15.079 --> 02:39:19.617 region:rollup2
AND I'M I ACTUALLY ACTUALLY IN

02:39:17.481 --> 02:39:20.751 region:rollup2
AND LOOKING AT THEM.

02:39:19.617 --> 02:39:22.052 region:rollup2
I THINK IT OPENS UP A

02:39:20.751 --> 02:39:24.121 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION A REALLY NEED TO

02:39:22.052 --> 02:39:26.023 region:rollup2
HAVE ESPECIALLY IN THE AFTERMATH

02:39:24.121 --> 02:39:27.525 region:rollup2
OF WAR BILL WHICH IS. SHOULD WE

02:39:26.023 --> 02:39:29.193 region:rollup2
HAVE A DIFFERENT. AND MORE

02:39:27.525 --> 02:39:30.394 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT OF THE

02:39:29.193 --> 02:39:31.929 region:rollup2
STATE WATER PROJECT ITSELF.

02:39:30.394 --> 02:39:34.465 region:rollup2
AND.

02:39:31.929 --> 02:39:35.433 region:rollup2
SO WHAT.

02:39:34.465 --> 02:39:37.435 region:rollup2
I AM GOING TO ACCEPT THE

02:39:35.433 --> 02:39:38.469 region:rollup2
COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS.

02:39:37.435 --> 02:39:40.037 region:rollup2
AND THEN WHAT THAT WOULD DO

02:39:38.469 --> 02:39:41.806 region:rollup2
INSTEAD IS ACTUALLY CREATE AN

02:39:40.037 --> 02:39:42.706 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT STATE WATER PROJECT

02:39:41.806 --> 02:39:44.675 region:rollup2
COMMISSION NINE MEMBER

02:39:42.706 --> 02:39:45.276 region:rollup2
COMMISSION.

02:39:44.675 --> 02:39:46.877 region:rollup2
I THAT WOULD OVERSEE THE STATE

02:39:45.276 --> 02:39:48.245 region:rollup2
WATER PROJECT.

02:39:46.877 --> 02:39:50.114 region:rollup2
INSISTS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS

02:39:48.245 --> 02:39:51.082 region:rollup2
BEEN PROPOSED PREVIOUSLY BY THE

02:39:50.114 --> 02:39:53.150 region:rollup2
LETTER LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION.

02:39:51.082 --> 02:39:54.385 region:rollup2
AND I'M.

02:39:53.150 --> 02:39:55.753 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IN THE AFTERMATH OF

02:39:54.385 --> 02:39:58.088 region:rollup2
OROVILLE.

02:39:55.753 --> 02:39:59.924 region:rollup2
THAT MANY OF YOU HAVE HAD.

02:39:58.088 --> 02:40:01.659 region:rollup2
HEARD OF AN OBSCENE THE FORENSIC

02:39:59.924 --> 02:40:03.794 region:rollup2
REPORT WHICH HIGHLIGHTED.

02:40:01.659 --> 02:40:05.463 region:rollup2
AND THERE WERE SOME.

02:40:03.794 --> 02:40:06.897 region:rollup2
MAJOR ISSUES THERE WITHOUT THE

02:40:05.463 --> 02:40:08.933 region:rollup2
W. ARE OPERATED AND MAINTAINED

02:40:06.897 --> 02:40:10.668 region:rollup2
OROVILLE DAM. FOR EXAMPLE IT

02:40:08.933 --> 02:40:12.603 region:rollup2
FOUND ORGANIZATIONAL FACTORS IN

02:40:10.668 --> 02:40:14.405 region:rollup2
HUMAN FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTED

02:40:12.603 --> 02:40:16.106 region:rollup2
TO THAT. THAT THERE WAS A

02:40:14.405 --> 02:40:18.776 region:rollup2
CULTURAL.

02:40:16.106 --> 02:40:19.577 region:rollup2
A OVERCONFIDENCE IDW ARE ABOUT

02:40:18.776 --> 02:40:20.544 region:rollup2
THE INTEGRITY OF THE STATE WATER

02:40:19.577 --> 02:40:22.513 region:rollup2
PROJECT.

02:40:20.544 --> 02:40:24.081 region:rollup2
AND.

02:40:22.513 --> 02:40:25.249 region:rollup2
A REACTIVE VERSUS PROACTIVE

02:40:24.081 --> 02:40:27.051 region:rollup2
APPROACH TO PROJECT MAY

02:40:25.249 --> 02:40:28.018 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT.

02:40:27.051 --> 02:40:29.753 region:rollup2
THERE WERE BASIC DESIGN AND

02:40:28.018 --> 02:40:31.822 region:rollup2
MAINTENANCE

02:40:29.753 --> 02:40:32.690 region:rollup2
FLAWS THAT WERE.

02:40:31.822 --> 02:40:34.458 region:rollup2
BUT NOT ADDRESS DIMMER

02:40:32.690 --> 02:40:36.594 region:rollup2
OVERLOOKED.

02:40:34.458 --> 02:40:37.862 region:rollup2
AND AND THERE WERE COST CONTROL

02:40:36.594 --> 02:40:39.396 region:rollup2
PRESSURES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED

02:40:37.862 --> 02:40:41.131 region:rollup2
IN THE.

02:40:39.396 --> 02:40:43.067 region:rollup2
OF THE REPORT IS WELL THAT THAT

02:40:41.131 --> 02:40:45.202 region:rollup2
LED TO THE CRISIS.

02:40:43.067 --> 02:40:46.570 region:rollup2
AND SO WHAT THIS WHAT THE

02:40:45.202 --> 02:40:47.638 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE MEMBERS WOULD DO IS

02:40:46.570 --> 02:40:48.706 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY CREATE A NEW COMMISSION

02:40:47.638 --> 02:40:50.574 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD PROVIDE THAT

02:40:48.706 --> 02:40:51.041 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT TO THE STATE WATER

02:40:50.574 --> 02:40:52.476 region:rollup2
PROJECT AN INDEPENDENT

02:40:51.041 --> 02:40:53.744 region:rollup2
COMMISSION.

02:40:52.476 --> 02:40:55.312 region:rollup2
AS WE HAVE IN MANY OTHER

02:40:53.744 --> 02:40:55.880 region:rollup2
INSTANCES AND I ACTUALLY AS WE

02:40:55.312 --> 02:40:57.548 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAVE IN MANY OTHER

02:40:55.880 --> 02:40:59.049 region:rollup2
STATES.

02:40:57.548 --> 02:41:00.050 region:rollup2
WERE ACTUALLY KIND OF A VERY

02:40:59.049 --> 02:41:01.685 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT CALIFORNIAN THAT WE

02:41:00.050 --> 02:41:03.053 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE.

02:41:01.685 --> 02:41:04.288 region:rollup2
A AN INDEPENDENT BODY

02:41:03.053 --> 02:41:05.456 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT COMMISSION PROVIDING

02:41:04.288 --> 02:41:07.658 region:rollup2
THAT OVERSIGHT.

02:41:05.456 --> 02:41:08.792 region:rollup2
AND.

02:41:07.658 --> 02:41:10.394 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THIS IS VERY MUCH

02:41:08.792 --> 02:41:11.695 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO.

02:41:10.394 --> 02:41:13.397 region:rollup2
DISCUSS A MOVE FOR OBVIOUS

02:41:11.695 --> 02:41:14.932 region:rollup2
CAESAR COMMITTEE MEMBERS BEING

02:41:13.397 --> 02:41:15.499 region:rollup2
PROPOSED A DAY AND THERE NEEDS

02:41:14.932 --> 02:41:16.433 region:rollup2
TO BE MORE DISCUSSION MOVING

02:41:15.499 --> 02:41:18.836 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

02:41:16.433 --> 02:41:19.970 region:rollup2
BUT I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS VERY

02:41:18.836 --> 02:41:20.871 region:rollup2
MUCH A DISCUSSION WE NEED TO

02:41:19.970 --> 02:41:23.073 region:rollup2
HAVE IN A DIRECTION WE NEED TO

02:41:20.871 --> 02:41:23.574 region:rollup2
MOVE IN.

02:41:23.073 --> 02:41:25.242 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THINK THAT THE

02:41:23.574 --> 02:41:26.443 region:rollup2
COMMISSION WOULD DO.

02:41:25.242 --> 02:41:27.177 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THIS IS VERY

02:41:26.443 --> 02:41:28.979 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT AS PROVIDE

02:41:27.177 --> 02:41:30.681 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY.

02:41:28.979 --> 02:41:32.516 region:rollup2
THE COMMISSION WOULD BE

02:41:30.681 --> 02:41:34.985 region:rollup2
GOVERNED BY BAGLEY KEENE.

02:41:32.516 --> 02:41:36.720 region:rollup2
THAT SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY

02:41:34.985 --> 02:41:38.289 region:rollup2
NOT QUITE THE CASE WITH

02:41:36.720 --> 02:41:40.090 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES

02:41:38.289 --> 02:41:41.025 region:rollup2
RESOURCES RIGHT NOW WHEN IT

02:41:40.090 --> 02:41:42.526 region:rollup2
COMES TO HOW THE STATE WATER

02:41:41.025 --> 02:41:44.662 region:rollup2
PROJECT.

02:41:42.526 --> 02:41:45.930 region:rollup2
IS OF MAINTAINED WE DON'T HAVE

02:41:44.662 --> 02:41:47.731 region:rollup2
THAT ANSWER HAVE THE SAME

02:41:45.930 --> 02:41:49.567 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY AND ACCESS.

02:41:47.731 --> 02:41:52.136 region:rollup2
TWO RECORDS THAT WE WOULD HAVE

02:41:49.567 --> 02:41:52.770 region:rollup2
UNDER BAGLEY KEENE. PASSABLY

02:41:52.136 --> 02:41:54.805 region:rollup2
THAT'S ANOTHER IMPORTANT MEASURE

02:41:52.770 --> 02:41:55.873 region:rollup2
SO. THAT I WOULD ACCEPT THE

02:41:54.805 --> 02:41:56.307 region:rollup2
COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND I

02:41:55.873 --> 02:41:57.575 region:rollup2
WOULD ASK.

02:41:56.307 --> 02:41:58.742 region:rollup2
FOR THIS COMMITTEE SUPPORT AS

02:41:57.575 --> 02:42:01.545 region:rollup2

AND CONTINUED MUCH NEED REFORM.

02:42:01.545 --> 02:42:04.215 region:rollup2

COME FORWARD AND.

02:42:16.427 --> 02:42:21.031 region:rollup2
I JUST FIND SUPPORT A BILL.

CALIFORNIA WERE SUPPORTIVE AT

02:42:29.907 --> 02:42:32.376 region:rollup2
THE INITIAL CONCEPT THE BILL

02:42:31.008 --> 02:42:33.010 region:rollup2
I'VE JUST HAVEN'T HAD ANY CHANCE

02:42:32.376 --> 02:42:34.745 region:rollup2
TO WAY AND.

02:42:33.010 --> 02:42:36.113 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY BUT WE ARE

02:42:34.745 --> 02:42:37.514 region:rollup2
LOOKING FOR TWO WAYS TO PUT MORE

02:42:36.113 --> 02:42:39.149 region:rollup2
EMPHASIS ON MAINTENANCE OF

02:42:37.514 --> 02:42:40.618 region:rollup2
EXISTING DAMS IN THE STATE BAD

02:42:39.149 --> 02:42:41.685 region:rollup2
DOING SO WHICH COULD INCREASE

02:42:40.618 --> 02:42:43.587 region:rollup2
WATER SUPPLY.

02:42:41.685 --> 02:42:44.588 region:rollup2
WHILE STAYING WITHIN THE

02:42:43.587 --> 02:42:45.756 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF

02:42:44.588 --> 02:42:46.991 region:rollup2
EXISTING STRUCTURES AND MAKE

02:42:45.756 --> 02:42:48.425 region:rollup2
THOSE OVERALL SAFER.

02:42:46.991 --> 02:42:48.993 region:rollup2
WE WILL LOOK AT THE MOMENT SAID

02:42:48.425 --> 02:42:50.594 region:rollup2
AND WEIGH IN ON THOSE IN THE

02:42:48.993 --> 02:42:51.629 region:rollup2
FUTURE.

02:42:50.594 --> 02:42:53.264 region:rollup2
THANK YOU YOU ELSE WISHING TO

DESPITE OPPOSITION.

02:43:07.611 --> 02:43:10.180 region:rollup2
MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS.

02:43:08.712 --> 02:43:11.582 region:rollup2
ED MANNING ON BEHALF THE MOJAVE

02:43:10.180 --> 02:43:13.250 region:rollup2
WATER AGENCIES STATE WATER

02:43:11.582 --> 02:43:15.052 region:rollup2
PROJECT CONTRACTOR.

02:43:13.250 --> 02:43:15.886 region:rollup2
WE DID NOT HAVE A POSITION ON

02:43:15.052 --> 02:43:18.355 region:rollup2
THIS BILL.

02:43:15.886 --> 02:43:20.357 region:rollup2
UNTIL NOW.

02:43:18.355 --> 02:43:22.493 region:rollup2
AND THE REASON WE DIDN'T IS

02:43:20.357 --> 02:43:24.228 region:rollup2
MISTER GALLAGHER'S BILLATTEMPT

02:43:22.493 --> 02:43:25.796 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS AN ISSUE. THAT

02:43:24.228 --> 02:43:28.265 region:rollup2
IMPACTED HIS DISTRICT DIRECTLY

02:43:25.796 --> 02:43:29.233 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THE ISSUE DAM SAFETY.

02:43:28.265 --> 02:43:31.535 region:rollup2
AND THE QUESTION OF THE ROLE

02:43:29.233 --> 02:43:33.370 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES IN

02:43:31.535 --> 02:43:35.072 region:rollup2
INSPECTING AROUND FACILITIES

02:43:33.370 --> 02:43:37.041 region:rollup2
WHICH IS A LEGITIMATE.

02:43:35.072 --> 02:43:39.043 region:rollup2
ISSUE FOR DEBATE AND SO WE HELD

02:43:37.041 --> 02:43:42.279 region:rollup2
OFF.

02:43:39.043 --> 02:43:44.815 region:rollup2
BUT THIS IS NOW A RADICAL BILL

02:43:42.279 --> 02:43:46.550 region:rollup2
THIS BILL REVERSES FIFTY YEARS

02:43:44.815 --> 02:43:49.353 region:rollup2
OF HISTORY THE BURNS PORTER AT.

02:43:46.550 --> 02:43:51.989 region:rollup2
AND IN A COMMITTEE AMENDMENT.

02:43:49.353 --> 02:43:53.957 region:rollup2
SUGGESTS THAT WE SHOULD TAKE.

02:43:51.989 --> 02:43:55.292 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES.

02:43:53.957 --> 02:43:56.527 region:rollup2
AND TAKE AWAY THE STATE WATER

02:43:55.292 --> 02:43:58.796 region:rollup2
PROJECT AND JUST PUT IT IN

02:43:56.527 --> 02:44:00.364 region:rollup2
ANOTHER AGENCY.

02:43:58.796 --> 02:44:02.032 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU GONNA CHANGE FIFTY

02:44:00.364 --> 02:44:04.068 region:rollup2
YEARS OF CALIFORNIA WATER

02:44:02.032 --> 02:44:06.070 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE HISTORY GOVERNANCE.

02:44:04.068 --> 02:44:07.137 region:rollup2
PERHAPS.

02:44:06.070 --> 02:44:08.706 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO AN INTERIM

02:44:07.137 --> 02:44:10.140 region:rollup2
STUDY.

02:44:08.706 --> 02:44:11.775 region:rollup2
PERHAPS THE COMMITTEE SHOULD

02:44:10.140 --> 02:44:13.877 region:rollup2
HAVE NUMEROUS INFORMATIONAL

02:44:11.775 --> 02:44:15.746 region:rollup2
HEARINGS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE

02:44:13.877 --> 02:44:16.313 region:rollup2
WATER BONDS ARE STRUCTURED.

02:44:15.746 --> 02:44:17.715 region:rollup2
THE ROLE OF THE STATE WATER

02:44:16.313 --> 02:44:18.716 region:rollup2
PROJECT.

02:44:17.715 --> 02:44:20.984 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT THE STATE WATER

02:44:18.716 --> 02:44:22.586 region:rollup2
PROJECT CONTRACTORS RATE PAYERS

02:44:20.984 --> 02:44:24.054 region:rollup2
ARE THE ONES WHO PAY AND. IN

02:44:22.586 --> 02:44:25.689 region:rollup2
MANY OTHER STATES ACTUALLY THE

02:44:24.054 --> 02:44:27.157 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE IS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO

02:44:25.689 --> 02:44:28.659 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY PAY THE RATES LIKE

02:44:27.157 --> 02:44:30.260 region:rollup2
MOJAVE WATER AGENCY RATEPAYERS

02:44:28.659 --> 02:44:31.428 region:rollup2
ARE METROPOLITAN.

02:44:30.260 --> 02:44:33.430 region:rollup2
HAVE DIRECT GOVERNANCE OVER THE

02:44:31.428 --> 02:44:35.132 region:rollup2
PROJECT.

02:44:33.430 --> 02:44:36.433 region:rollup2
SO WE CAME HERE TODAY NOT

02:44:35.132 --> 02:44:38.335 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATING BEING IN THIS

02:44:36.433 --> 02:44:40.537 region:rollup2
POSITION. BUT THIS BILL NOW

02:44:38.335 --> 02:44:41.672 region:rollup2
DRAMATICALLY CHANGES

02:44:40.537 --> 02:44:43.474 region:rollup2
THE STRUCTURE OF CALIFORNIA

02:44:41.672 --> 02:44:45.642 region:rollup2
WATER POLICY.

02:44:43.474 --> 02:44:47.344 region:rollup2
AND WE WOULD ARGUE THAT PERHAPS

02:44:45.642 --> 02:44:49.680 region:rollup2
IT WOULD BE BETTER DONE NOT IN

02:44:47.344 --> 02:44:51.849 region:rollup2
THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT. BUT IN

02:44:49.680 --> 02:44:53.717 region:rollup2
A FULL FLEDGED DISCUSSION ON AN

02:44:51.849 --> 02:44:55.252 region:rollup2
ISSUE THAT REALLY MERITS FAR

02:44:53.717 --> 02:44:55.886 region:rollup2
MORE.

02:44:55.252 --> 02:44:59.389 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION AND THOUGHT THAN THIS

02:44:55.886 --> 02:45:00.691 region:rollup2

DISTRICT ON JUST TO BUILD SOME

02:45:04.795 --> 02:45:07.865 region:rollup2
OF MY COLLEAGUES SAID ON.

02:45:05.896 --> 02:45:09.800 region:rollup2
HOLIDAYS FOR THE LATE OPPOSE.

02:45:07.865 --> 02:45:12.102 region:rollup2
WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE BILL

02:45:09.800 --> 02:45:14.204 region:rollup2
THIS IS A VERY COMPLEX

02:45:12.102 --> 02:45:15.939 region:rollup2
SITUATION OTHERS FINANCIAL

02:45:14.204 --> 02:45:17.908 region:rollup2
IMPLICATIONS I DON'T BELIEVE

02:45:15.939 --> 02:45:19.943 region:rollup2
IT'S READY FOR PRIMETIME YET

02:45:17.908 --> 02:45:21.545 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVELY. WE SHOULD DUST

02:45:19.943 --> 02:45:23.247 region:rollup2
OFF THAT TWENTY TEN LITTLE

02:45:21.545 --> 02:45:24.415 region:rollup2
HOOVER COMMISSION ANALYSIS.

02:45:23.247 --> 02:45:26.316 region:rollup2
MAYBE COME UP WITH SOME

02:45:24.415 --> 02:45:27.551 region:rollup2
HEARINGS AND DEVELOP A PLAN

02:45:26.316 --> 02:45:29.219 region:rollup2
THAT'S FULLY DEVELOPED WITH

02:45:27.551 --> 02:45:32.055 region:rollup2
INPUT FROM STAKE HOLDERS.

02:45:29.219 --> 02:45:34.425 region:rollup2
NOT ALL OPTIONS OF GOVERNANCE.

02:45:32.055 --> 02:45:35.459 region:rollup2
AND OVERSIGHT TRANSPARENCY HAVE

02:45:34.425 --> 02:45:37.161 region:rollup2
BEEN EXPLORED UNDER THE BILL AS

02:45:35.459 --> 02:45:38.929 region:rollup2
PROPOSED.

02:45:37.161 --> 02:45:41.165 region:rollup2
WATER RIGHTS DEBT SERVICE

02:45:38.929 --> 02:45:42.032 region:rollup2
OBLIGATIONS BONDS THIS IS A HUGE

02:45:41.165 --> 02:45:43.567 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

02:45:42.032 --> 02:45:44.601 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD JUST URGE THE

02:45:43.567 --> 02:45:46.236 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER THAT IT'S

02:45:44.601 --> 02:45:48.038 region:rollup2
NOT REALLY PRIME TIME YET FOR

02:45:46.236 --> 02:45:48.572 region:rollup2
THIS AND MORE ADVANCED WORK IS

02:45:48.038 --> 02:45:48.772 region:rollup2
NECESSARY THANK YOU MISTER

ON THE BILL WE ASSOCIATE ARE.

02:45:59.149 --> 02:46:03.287 region:rollup2
CONCERN WITH ABOUT FIVE

02:46:01.084 --> 02:46:04.555 region:rollup2
EXCLAMATION POINTS A.

02:46:03.287 --> 02:46:06.457 region:rollup2

FIVE.

02:46:08.358 --> 02:46:13.630 region:rollup2
ANYWHERE ELSE.

02:46:11.962 --> 02:46:18.502 region:rollup2
LORENA BRING IT BACK TO ANY

02:46:13.630 --> 02:46:20.437 region:rollup2

02:46:20.437 --> 02:46:22.806 region:rollup2
LET'S WANT TO GIVE US GALLAGHER

02:46:21.572 --> 02:46:24.908 region:rollup2
CHANCE TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE

02:46:22.806 --> 02:46:26.844 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION AND HAVE WE LOOKED AT

02:46:24.908 --> 02:46:27.778 region:rollup2
DOING ANY INTERIM HEARINGS OR

02:46:26.844 --> 02:46:28.979 region:rollup2
ANYTHING ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE

02:46:27.778 --> 02:46:30.614 region:rollup2
SUM WITH THIS WOULD ACTUALLY

02:46:28.979 --> 02:46:33.283 region:rollup2
INTEL AND THE UNINTENDED

02:46:30.614 --> 02:46:35.052 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH ACTION.

02:46:33.283 --> 02:46:36.420 region:rollup2
SO FIRST THEY WERE COMMITTEE

02:46:35.052 --> 02:46:36.653 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS THAT WERE BROUGHT

02:46:36.420 --> 02:46:38.989 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

02:46:36.653 --> 02:46:41.091 region:rollup2
.

02:46:38.989 --> 02:46:43.360 region:rollup2
BUT IT REALLY GOT THE HEART OF

02:46:41.091 --> 02:46:44.928 region:rollup2
WHAT I WAS TRYING TO DO AND SO.

02:46:43.360 --> 02:46:46.763 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY THE

02:46:44.928 --> 02:46:48.298 region:rollup2
INVERSE OF WHAT I WAS TRYING TO

02:46:46.763 --> 02:46:49.967 region:rollup2
DO RIGHT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

02:46:48.298 --> 02:46:51.668 region:rollup2
IS PULL DIVISION A DAM SAFETY.

02:46:49.967 --> 02:46:52.135 region:rollup2
OUT OF DEPARTMENT OF WATER

02:46:51.668 --> 02:46:53.470 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AND MAKE IT

02:46:52.135 --> 02:46:55.172 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT.

02:46:53.470 --> 02:46:56.373 region:rollup2
BUT ACTUALLY THE CONFLICT GOES

02:46:55.172 --> 02:46:58.942 region:rollup2
AWAY IF YOU JUST TAKE THE STATE

02:46:56.373 --> 02:47:00.477 region:rollup2
WATER PROJECT OUT OF VW ARE.

02:46:58.942 --> 02:47:02.246 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE W. ARE WILL SERVE

02:47:00.477 --> 02:47:04.181 region:rollup2
ITS REGULATORY FUNCTION. OF

02:47:02.246 --> 02:47:05.582 region:rollup2
INSPECTING DAMS ACROSS THE STATE

SO ID IT ACCOMPLISHES THE SAME

02:47:07.117 --> 02:47:10.888 region:rollup2
PURPOSE.

AND WE NEED TO START HAVING THE

02:47:22.332 --> 02:47:24.268 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION.

02:47:22.666 --> 02:47:26.003 region:rollup2
.

BUT THAT'S FIFTY PLUS YEARS OF

02:47:27.671 --> 02:47:30.307 region:rollup2
WHAT THIS FORENSIC REPORTER

02:47:28.805 --> 02:47:31.742 region:rollup2
SHOWN WAS.

02:47:30.307 --> 02:47:33.977 region:rollup2
A NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO A

02:47:31.742 --> 02:47:35.646 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL DESIGN FLAW IN THE

02:47:33.977 --> 02:47:36.914 region:rollup2
SPILLWAY AT THE AT ORVILLE. AND

02:47:35.646 --> 02:47:38.115 region:rollup2

EIGHTY THOUSAND OF MY

02:47:41.485 --> 02:47:45.589 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS.

02:47:42.953 --> 02:47:46.623 region:rollup2
AND AT RISK IT'S NOT NOT PAID

02:47:45.589 --> 02:47:48.825 region:rollup2
ATTENTION TO VERY CLEAR

02:47:46.623 --> 02:47:50.527 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL FLAWS CRACKS THAT

02:47:48.825 --> 02:47:52.429 region:rollup2
WERE FORMING IN THAT SPILLWAY

02:47:50.527 --> 02:47:54.932 region:rollup2
THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN. THAT.

02:47:52.429 --> 02:47:55.933 region:rollup2
NOT ME THAT THE FORENSIC TEAM.

02:47:54.932 --> 02:47:57.467 region:rollup2
TOTALLY INDEPENDENT GROUP OF OF

02:47:55.933 --> 02:47:58.835 region:rollup2
EXPERTS

02:47:57.467 --> 02:48:00.604 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT AND SAID THAT SHOULD

02:47:58.835 --> 02:48:01.638 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN. A SOMETHING THAT THEY

02:48:00.604 --> 02:48:02.673 region:rollup2
SHOULD HAVE PAID ATTENTION TO

02:48:01.638 --> 02:48:04.141 region:rollup2
AND UNDERSTOOD THAT THAT WAS A

02:48:02.673 --> 02:48:06.043 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL FLAW.

02:48:04.141 --> 02:48:07.644 region:rollup2
AND IT'S YEARS OF OF DEFERRED

02:48:06.043 --> 02:48:09.479 region:rollup2
MAINTENANCE.

02:48:07.644 --> 02:48:11.081 region:rollup2
OF ISSUES NOT BEING ADDRESSED OF

02:48:09.479 --> 02:48:12.282 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONAL FLAWS A CULTURE

02:48:11.081 --> 02:48:14.318 region:rollup2
THAT THE INDEPENDENT.

02:48:12.282 --> 02:48:15.652 region:rollup2
FORENSIC TEAM.

02:48:14.318 --> 02:48:17.654 region:rollup2
SAID A CULTURE WHERE THEY

02:48:15.652 --> 02:48:19.523 region:rollup2
CREATED A MYTHOLOGY.

02:48:17.654 --> 02:48:21.224 region:rollup2
A MYTHOLOGY QUOTE UNQUOTE OF

02:48:19.523 --> 02:48:23.060 region:rollup2
WHAT OF THE INTEGRITY OF OF THE

02:48:21.224 --> 02:48:24.861 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE UP THERE.

02:48:23.060 --> 02:48:26.997 region:rollup2
THAT CAN'T BE IGNORED THAT

02:48:24.861 --> 02:48:28.832 region:rollup2
FIFTY PLUS YEARS.

02:48:26.997 --> 02:48:30.133 region:rollup2
OF WHAT I WOULD CALL.

02:48:28.832 --> 02:48:31.835 region:rollup2
NOT VERY GOOD ORGANIZATION NOT

02:48:30.133 --> 02:48:33.537 region:rollup2
GET MAINTENANCE

02:48:31.835 --> 02:48:35.205 region:rollup2
ANNA AND NOT TAKING CARE OF THE

02:48:33.537 --> 02:48:37.240 region:rollup2
STATE WATER PROJECT THAT DOESN'T

02:48:35.205 --> 02:48:39.142 region:rollup2
JUST AFFECT MY DISTRICT RIGHT.

02:48:37.240 --> 02:48:41.712 region:rollup2
IT AFFECTS THE ENTIRE STATE.

02:48:39.142 --> 02:48:43.480 region:rollup2
SENSE THAT THAT FIFTY YEARS OF

02:48:41.712 --> 02:48:45.182 region:rollup2
POOR MANAGEMENT HAS BEEN NOW

02:48:43.480 --> 02:48:46.216 region:rollup2
REVEALED FOR THE WORLD. I THINK

02:48:45.182 --> 02:48:47.818 region:rollup2
IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT WE HAVE

02:48:46.216 --> 02:48:49.286 region:rollup2
THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT HAVING AN

02:48:47.818 --> 02:48:51.455 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT COMMISSION AS WE'VE

02:48:49.286 --> 02:48:52.723 region:rollup2
DONE IN MANY OTHER AREAS.

02:48:51.455 --> 02:48:54.725 region:rollup2
TAKE OVER CONTROL THE STATE

02:48:52.723 --> 02:48:55.258 region:rollup2
WATER PROJECT IN ENSURE.

02:48:54.725 --> 02:48:56.793 region:rollup2
THAT THOSE THINGS ARE DONE

02:48:55.258 --> 02:48:58.996 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

02:48:56.793 --> 02:48:59.630 region:rollup2
ANNA AND I WOULD REMIND ACTUALLY

02:48:58.996 --> 02:49:00.731 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW PEOPLE FROM OTHER PARTS

02:48:59.630 --> 02:49:01.031 region:rollup2
OF THE STATE.

02:49:00.731 --> 02:49:03.233 region:rollup2
NOW THAT.

02:49:01.031 --> 02:49:04.835 region:rollup2
YOU CAN'T HOLD AS MUCH WATER IN

02:49:03.233 --> 02:49:05.369 region:rollup2
OROVILLE DAM.

02:49:04.835 --> 02:49:07.904 region:rollup2
AFTER THE WETTEST YEAR ON

02:49:05.369 --> 02:49:09.673 region:rollup2
RECORD.

02:49:07.904 --> 02:49:11.508 region:rollup2
MANY WATER DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT

02:49:09.673 --> 02:49:12.976 region:rollup2
THE STATE ARE GOING TO BE FACING

02:49:11.508 --> 02:49:14.411 region:rollup2
WATER SHORTAGE SHORTAGES AND

02:49:12.976 --> 02:49:15.679 region:rollup2
WE'RE BASIC GONNA BE POTENTIALLY

02:49:14.411 --> 02:49:17.080 region:rollup2
BACK IN A DROUGHT.

02:49:15.679 --> 02:49:18.515 region:rollup2
SITUATION BECAUSE OF THAT SAME

02:49:17.080 --> 02:49:19.583 region:rollup2
MISMANAGEMENT.

02:49:18.515 --> 02:49:22.552 region:rollup2
AND SO REGARDLESS OF WHERE

02:49:19.583 --> 02:49:24.287 region:rollup2
YOU'RE FROM. IN CALIFORNIA. AND

02:49:22.552 --> 02:49:26.590 region:rollup2
YOU SHOULD WANT.

02:49:24.287 --> 02:49:27.057 region:rollup2
BETTER OVERSIGHT AND MANAGEMENT

02:49:26.590 --> 02:49:28.625 region:rollup2
YOU SHOULD WANT BETTER

02:49:27.057 --> 02:49:29.526 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY.

02:49:28.625 --> 02:49:31.294 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE OTHER THING ABOUT THE

02:49:29.526 --> 02:49:33.430 region:rollup2
COMMISSION WE SHOULD WANT BETTER

02:49:31.294 --> 02:49:35.198 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY. ABOUT HOW THESE

02:49:33.430 --> 02:49:36.500 region:rollup2
DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT.

02:49:35.198 --> 02:49:38.268 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO HOW THESE

02:49:36.500 --> 02:49:40.671 region:rollup2
ISSUES ARE BEING ADDRESSED AND I

02:49:38.268 --> 02:49:41.338 region:rollup2
THINK WE YOU KNOW WE CAN ARGUE

02:49:40.671 --> 02:49:43.173 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT THAT COMMISSION LOOKS

02:49:41.338 --> 02:49:44.608 region:rollup2
LIKE? I WANT TO HAVE CONTINUE

02:49:43.173 --> 02:49:45.976 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION ON THAT I'M GONNA

02:49:44.608 --> 02:49:48.211 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO DISCUSS.

02:49:45.976 --> 02:49:50.380 region:rollup2
AND HAVE OPEN DIALOGUE WITH THE

02:49:48.211 --> 02:49:51.281 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION I'M NOT GOING AWAY I

02:49:50.380 --> 02:49:52.883 region:rollup2
TO REMIND PEOPLE I AM A

02:49:51.281 --> 02:49:53.850 region:rollup2
REPUBLICAN.

02:49:52.883 --> 02:49:56.253 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOTHING THAT I CAN

02:49:53.850 --> 02:49:56.420 region:rollup2
STEAMROLL THROUGH THIS PROCESS

02:49:56.253 --> 02:49:57.487 region:rollup2
BUT.

02:49:56.420 --> 02:49:58.488 region:rollup2
BE OTHERS KNOW WHERE I CAN

02:49:57.487 --> 02:49:59.856 region:rollup2
STEAMROLL ANYTHING THROUGH THIS

02:49:58.488 --> 02:50:00.424 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

02:49:59.856 --> 02:50:03.460 region:rollup2
AND AND I I THINK THIS IS A

02:50:00.424 --> 02:50:04.628 region:rollup2
GOOD.

02:50:03.460 --> 02:50:05.762 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S NEW

02:50:04.628 --> 02:50:07.264 region:rollup2
THIS WAS BROUGHT UP BY THE

02:50:05.762 --> 02:50:08.865 region:rollup2
LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION. SNOT

02:50:07.264 --> 02:50:10.500 region:rollup2
THIS NEW CONCEPT IT'S BEEN BEING

02:50:08.865 --> 02:50:12.069 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED AND TALKED ABOUT EYES

02:50:10.500 --> 02:50:13.670 region:rollup2
ONE OPEN UP THE DISCUSSION AND

02:50:12.069 --> 02:50:15.172 region:rollup2
CONTINUE IT AND SO THAT'S WHY I

02:50:13.670 --> 02:50:16.940 region:rollup2
WOULD ASK. FOR THE COMMITTEE

02:50:15.172 --> 02:50:18.408 region:rollup2
SUPPORT TODAY A TO MOVE THIS

02:50:16.940 --> 02:50:20.077 region:rollup2
MEASURE FOR.

02:50:18.408 --> 02:50:21.578 region:rollup2
SO IN HEAR DISCUSSIONS AND YOUR

02:50:20.077 --> 02:50:22.679 region:rollup2
RESEARCH ORDER JUST FOLLOW UP

02:50:21.578 --> 02:50:23.980 region:rollup2
AND YOU'VE MENTIONED THE LITTLE

02:50:22.679 --> 02:50:24.548 region:rollup2
HOOVER COMMISSION BUT THERE IS

02:50:23.980 --> 02:50:24.915 region:rollup2
THERE ANYTHING IN THE LITTLE

02:50:24.548 --> 02:50:26.183 region:rollup2
WHO.

02:50:24.915 --> 02:50:28.051 region:rollup2
HOOVER COMMISSION REPORT THAT'S

02:50:26.183 --> 02:50:29.753 region:rollup2
REFLECTED IN THE LEGISLATION OR

02:50:28.051 --> 02:50:31.922 region:rollup2
IN THE BILL CURRENTLY.

02:50:29.753 --> 02:50:33.023 region:rollup2
THE YES IT IT BASICALLY TAKES

02:50:31.922 --> 02:50:35.058 region:rollup2
THE WILL HOOVER COMMISSION'S

02:50:33.023 --> 02:50:37.394 region:rollup2
IDEA OF CREATING A NINE MEMBER

02:50:35.058 --> 02:50:40.497 region:rollup2
COMMISSION THAT WOULD OVERSEE.

02:50:37.394 --> 02:50:44.301 region:rollup2
DE AT THE STATE WATER PROJECT

02:50:40.497 --> 02:50:45.469 region:rollup2

YOU KNOW THERE ARE. YOU KNOW

02:50:45.469 --> 02:50:49.139 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES BUT

02:50:47.337 --> 02:50:50.307 region:rollup2
LARGELY IT'S THE SAME IDEA AND

02:50:49.139 --> 02:50:52.509 region:rollup2
CONCEPT THAT WAS PUSHED BY THE

02:50:50.307 --> 02:50:53.710 region:rollup2
LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION.

02:50:52.509 --> 02:50:56.113 region:rollup2
OKAY UPSTART BECAUSE I THOUGHT

02:50:53.710 --> 02:50:57.347 region:rollup2
THE LANGUAGE WAS TO. BASICALLY

02:50:56.113 --> 02:50:59.416 region:rollup2
JUST HANDED OVER TO THE NATURAL

02:50:57.347 --> 02:51:01.885 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AGENCY THAT'S WHAT THE

02:50:59.416 --> 02:51:03.353 region:rollup2
BILL DID ORIGINALLY WAS I WOULD.

02:51:01.885 --> 02:51:03.887 region:rollup2
ORIGINALLY THE BILL WOULD OF

02:51:03.353 --> 02:51:06.123 region:rollup2
TAKEN THE DIVISION OF DAM

02:51:03.887 --> 02:51:08.091 region:rollup2
SAFETY.

02:51:06.123 --> 02:51:10.761 region:rollup2
OUT OF THE W. R. AND PUT IT

02:51:08.091 --> 02:51:11.628 region:rollup2
UNDER NATURAL RESOURCES.

02:51:10.761 --> 02:51:14.097 region:rollup2
NOW WITH THE COMMITTEE

02:51:11.628 --> 02:51:15.765 region:rollup2

02:51:14.097 --> 02:51:16.800 region:rollup2
MEMBER COMMISSION.

02:51:15.765 --> 02:51:19.002 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE TASKED WITH

02:51:16.800 --> 02:51:20.771 region:rollup2
OVERSEEN THE STATE WATER PROJECT

02:51:19.002 --> 02:51:22.139 region:rollup2
IN BASE WE WOULD TAKE STATE. THE

02:51:20.771 --> 02:51:24.407 region:rollup2
STATE WATER PROJECT OUT OF THE

02:51:22.139 --> 02:51:26.276 region:rollup2

WHEN WE AGREED TO A FIVE YEAR

03:07:45.788 --> 03:07:49.058 region:rollup2
PHASE OUT OF AMMUNITION WE'VE

03:07:47.723 --> 03:07:50.593 region:rollup2
FRANKLY BELOW BELIEVE HAT THAT

03:07:49.058 --> 03:07:51.861 region:rollup2
WAS ACTUALLY GIVING THEM A LOT

03:07:50.593 --> 03:07:53.562 region:rollup2
OF TIME BECAUSE THERE WAS A TWO

03:07:51.861 --> 03:07:55.664 region:rollup2
THOUSAND FOURTEEN STUDY. THAT

03:07:53.562 --> 03:07:57.500 region:rollup2
SHOWED. THAT SPECIFICALLY IN

03:07:55.664 --> 03:07:59.101 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SEVENTY SEVEN PERCENT

03:07:57.500 --> 03:08:00.469 region:rollup2

03:07:59.101 --> 03:08:02.271 region:rollup2
ALREADY WERE STOCKING NON LEAD

03:08:00.469 --> 03:08:03.739 region:rollup2
AMMUNITION AND THAT THE STATE

03:08:02.271 --> 03:08:05.407 region:rollup2
CONCLUDED THERE WERE NO

03:08:03.739 --> 03:08:06.976 region:rollup2
REASONABLE VARIES IN CALIFORNIA.

03:08:05.407 --> 03:08:08.444 region:rollup2
REGULATING THE USE OF NON LEAD

03:08:06.976 --> 03:08:09.779 region:rollup2
AMMUNITION ON ALL STATE

03:08:08.444 --> 03:08:10.346 region:rollup2
PREVALENCE BY TWENTY FIFTEEN

03:08:09.779 --> 03:08:11.514 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN BUT WITH THAT BEING

03:08:10.346 --> 03:08:13.082 region:rollup2
SAID.

03:08:11.514 --> 03:08:14.150 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVED THAT IN THE

03:08:13.082 --> 03:08:15.784 region:rollup2
INTERESTS OF WORKING WITH THE

03:08:14.150 --> 03:08:17.553 region:rollup2
BRIT THE HONEYED COMMUNITY WE

03:08:15.784 --> 03:08:18.154 region:rollup2
WOULD GIVE A LONGER PHASE OUT.

03:08:17.553 --> 03:08:19.622 region:rollup2
ALLOW THE COMMISSION TO WORK

03:08:18.154 --> 03:08:21.624 region:rollup2
THROUGH IT AND THE COMMISSION

03:08:19.622 --> 03:08:23.826 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN A VERY

03:08:21.624 --> 03:08:25.094 region:rollup2
DETAILED AND EXTENSIVE PROCESS.

03:08:23.826 --> 03:08:27.129 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY HAVE ACTUALLY PUSHED

03:08:25.094 --> 03:08:28.697 region:rollup2
OUT THE MAJORITY OF THE LEAD TO

03:08:27.129 --> 03:08:30.199 region:rollup2
PHASE OUT TO JULY TWENTY

03:08:28.697 --> 03:08:32.535 region:rollup2
NINETEEN?

03:08:30.199 --> 03:08:34.470 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO HAVE A FIXED DATE FOR

03:08:32.535 --> 03:08:35.838 region:rollup2
PHASE OUT AND IT WAS IMPORTANT

03:08:34.470 --> 03:08:37.006 region:rollup2
BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE WHEN

03:08:35.838 --> 03:08:38.741 region:rollup2
THE FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE

03:08:37.006 --> 03:08:41.010 region:rollup2
WAS PHASING OUT THE USE OF SHOT

03:08:38.741 --> 03:08:42.745 region:rollup2
FOR A WATER MIGRATORY WATERFOWL.

03:08:41.010 --> 03:08:44.880 region:rollup2
IT IS IMPORTANT NOW BECAUSE YOU

03:08:42.745 --> 03:08:46.482 region:rollup2
NEED TO DRIVE YOU NEED CERTAINTY

03:08:44.880 --> 03:08:48.217 region:rollup2
TO DRIVE MARKET DEMAND.

03:08:46.482 --> 03:08:50.219 region:rollup2
CREATING UNCERTAINTY BY CREATING

03:08:48.217 --> 03:08:51.287 region:rollup2
A PROCESS THAT THIS BILL CREATES

03:08:50.219 --> 03:08:53.689 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD ALLOW DIFFERENT

03:08:51.287 --> 03:08:55.257 region:rollup2
CALIBERS TO TO POTENTIALLYPAID

03:08:53.689 --> 03:08:56.225 region:rollup2
OUT AT RANDOM TIMES WHEN WE

03:08:55.257 --> 03:08:57.693 region:rollup2
DON'T EVEN KNOW WHICH CALPERS

03:08:56.225 --> 03:08:59.929 region:rollup2
THEY MIGHT BE.

03:08:57.693 --> 03:09:01.997 region:rollup2
CREATE A MOVING TARGET.

03:08:59.929 --> 03:09:03.432 region:rollup2
AND AND FRANKLY IT'S UNFAIR TO

03:09:01.997 --> 03:09:05.201 region:rollup2
THOSE WHO'VE ALREADY RESPONSIBLY

03:09:03.432 --> 03:09:07.136 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATED AND RESPONDED TO THE

03:09:05.201 --> 03:09:08.470 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE AND MORE

03:09:07.136 --> 03:09:09.838 region:rollup2
IMPORTANTLY ALLOWS FOR CONTINUE

03:09:08.470 --> 03:09:11.874 region:rollup2
TO LEASE OF TOXIC LEAD

03:09:09.838 --> 03:09:14.443 region:rollup2
AMMUNITION ENVIRONMENT.

03:09:11.874 --> 03:09:16.212 region:rollup2
FURTHER IF THE AVAILABILITY OF

03:09:14.443 --> 03:09:18.347 region:rollup2
NON LIVE AMMUNITION WAS TRULY A

03:09:16.212 --> 03:09:20.382 region:rollup2
PROBLEM FOR HUNTING THEN WHY WAS

03:09:18.347 --> 03:09:21.317 region:rollup2
IT REPORTED JUST LAST WEEK IN

03:09:20.382 --> 03:09:23.419 region:rollup2
THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN

03:09:21.317 --> 03:09:24.920 region:rollup2

WILDLIFE SERVICES

03:09:26.522 --> 03:09:30.559 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THE FEDERAL ENTITY IN

03:09:28.757 --> 03:09:33.562 region:rollup2
CHARGE OF.

03:09:30.559 --> 03:09:34.964 region:rollup2
KILLING A AT NUISANCE ANIMALS

03:09:33.562 --> 03:09:36.432 region:rollup2
AND ALL DIFFERENT KINDS.

03:09:34.964 --> 03:09:37.499 region:rollup2
SO THEY'LL BE USING ALL

03:09:36.432 --> 03:09:39.468 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT KINDS OF AMMUNITION BY

03:09:37.499 --> 03:09:41.470 region:rollup2
THE WAY WHY WAS IT REPORTED THAT

03:09:39.468 --> 03:09:42.872 region:rollup2
THEY ARE GOING TO CONVERT TO ALL

03:09:41.470 --> 03:09:44.673 region:rollup2
NON LEADING AMMUNITION IN THEIR

03:09:42.872 --> 03:09:45.941 region:rollup2
FIELD SERVICES. A BECOME THE

03:09:44.673 --> 03:09:47.343 region:rollup2
NUMBER ONE CONSUMER OF NON LEAD

03:09:45.941 --> 03:09:48.444 region:rollup2

03:09:47.343 --> 03:09:50.980 region:rollup2
WHILE IT SERVICES KILLED FOREIGN

03:09:48.444 --> 03:09:52.748 region:rollup2
HALF MILLION ANIMALS A YEAR.

03:09:50.980 --> 03:09:54.216 region:rollup2
SO FRANKLY THAT'S A HECK OF A

03:09:52.748 --> 03:09:55.551 region:rollup2
MARKET MOVER AND I THINK WE'LL

03:09:54.216 --> 03:09:57.620 region:rollup2
BE PUSHING THE MARKET EVEN

03:09:55.551 --> 03:09:59.154 region:rollup2

AN AUTHORIZED RETAILER.

03:19:21.183 --> 03:19:25.587 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS IS ALSO VERY COSTLY.

03:19:24.519 --> 03:19:27.556 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY SOME CALIFORNIA

TWENTY NINETEEN NEXT YEAR DEMAND

TO TEMPORARILY SUSPEND THIS IS

03:19:56.718 --> 03:19:59.454 region:rollup2
ONLY A TEMPORARY SUSPENSION.

03:19:57.452 --> 03:20:03.191 region:rollup2

THE USE OF LEAD AMMUNITION FOR

03:20:06.061 --> 03:20:09.598 region:rollup2
THOSE CALIBERS THAT MAY BE

03:20:07.629 --> 03:20:10.165 region:rollup2
REASONABLE A.

03:20:09.598 --> 03:20:12.167 region:rollup2
UNAVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIA'S

RATHER WE WANT TO HIGHLIGHT

03:20:22.978 --> 03:20:25.680 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:20:23.879 --> 03:20:28.016 region:rollup2
SOLUTION.

03:20:25.680 --> 03:20:29.751 region:rollup2
THESE THREE PREVIOUS MEASURES

03:20:28.016 --> 03:20:31.286 region:rollup2
HAVE PLACED WITHIN THE HUNTING

03:20:29.751 --> 03:20:33.321 region:rollup2

ANOTHER PROBLEM WHAT DO YOU DO

03:20:42.964 --> 03:20:46.034 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU RUN OUT OF AMMUNITION

03:20:43.965 --> 03:20:49.170 region:rollup2
FOR HUNTING.

03:20:46.034 --> 03:20:50.238 region:rollup2
THIS IS A SEVERE PROBLEM.

03:20:49.170 --> 03:20:54.042 region:rollup2
THE AN ABILITY TO PURCHASE

03:20:50.238 --> 03:20:54.042 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR LOADS WILL RESULT IN

03:20:54.109 --> 03:20:58.446 region:rollup2
DEPRAVATION.

03:20:56.845 --> 03:21:00.148 region:rollup2

GAME COMES FROM THE CELL OF TAX.

03:21:09.124 --> 03:21:11.459 region:rollup2
IF MONSTER OUT HUNDREDS ARE VERY

03:24:10.205 --> 03:24:12.407 region:rollup2
THOUSAND AND IN PART OF THE

03:24:11.106 --> 03:24:14.209 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

03:24:12.407 --> 03:24:16.010 region:rollup2
IS THEY.

03:24:14.209 --> 03:24:17.612 region:rollup2
THE HABITAT OF THE MONARCHS NEED

03:24:16.010 --> 03:24:18.747 region:rollup2
TO TO BREED AND A LOT OF IT'S IN

03:24:17.612 --> 03:24:20.748 region:rollup2
THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN A LOT OF

03:24:18.747 --> 03:24:23.551 region:rollup2
IT HAS BEEN SUBJECTED TO

03:24:20.748 --> 03:24:25.420 region:rollup2
AGRICULTURAL AND OTHER. TYPES OF

03:24:23.551 --> 03:24:27.222 region:rollup2
USES BUT THERE'S AT THERE'S A

03:24:25.420 --> 03:24:28.456 region:rollup2
CHANCE TO BE ABLE TO RECOVER A

03:24:27.222 --> 03:24:29.991 region:rollup2
LOT OF THIS HABITAT. INTO THIS

03:24:28.456 --> 03:24:31.392 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WOULD DO WOULD BE TO PUT

03:24:29.991 --> 03:24:32.360 region:rollup2
SOME MONEY TO WORK WITH

03:24:31.392 --> 03:24:35.096 region:rollup2
LANDOWNERS THROUGHOUT THE

03:24:32.360 --> 03:24:37.265 region:rollup2
CENTRAL VALLEY. TO FACILITATE.

03:24:35.096 --> 03:24:39.300 region:rollup2
MONARCH HABITAT.

03:24:37.265 --> 03:24:41.002 region:rollup2
THIS IS CALLED THE.

MONARCH AND POLLINATOR RESCUE

03:24:41.002 --> 03:24:44.305 region:rollup2
PROGRAM HOW TO MAKE IT CLEAR

03:24:43.138 --> 03:24:45.173 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME CONFUSION

03:24:44.305 --> 03:24:46.941 region:rollup2
MONARCHS ARE NOT GREAT

03:24:45.173 --> 03:24:48.109 region:rollup2
POLLINATORS BUT IT DOES TURN OUT

03:24:46.941 --> 03:24:49.644 region:rollup2
THAT THE HABITAT THAT THEY USE

03:24:48.109 --> 03:24:51.112 region:rollup2
DOES.

03:24:49.644 --> 03:24:52.247 region:rollup2
FACILITATE THEY A NUMBER OF

03:24:51.112 --> 03:24:54.048 region:rollup2
SPECIES THAT ARE IN FACT

03:24:52.247 --> 03:24:55.450 region:rollup2
POLLINATORS.

03:24:54.048 --> 03:24:57.619 region:rollup2
THESE ARE ICONIC SPECIES THE

03:24:55.450 --> 03:24:59.521 region:rollup2
MONARCHS ALONG THE CENTRAL COAST

03:24:57.619 --> 03:25:01.222 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY COLLECT IN CYPRUS AND

03:24:59.521 --> 03:25:03.858 region:rollup2
THEY COLLECTED PINES THEY ALSO

03:25:01.222 --> 03:25:05.760 region:rollup2

EUCALYPTUS TREES THAT ARE

03:25:05.760 --> 03:25:08.696 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT MY DISTRICT BUT

03:25:07.262 --> 03:25:10.732 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE'RE SEEING SUCH

03:25:08.696 --> 03:25:12.467 region:rollup2
SUCH DECLINES IN POPULATIONS I

03:25:10.732 --> 03:25:13.902 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S VERY WORTH CREATING A

03:25:12.467 --> 03:25:16.104 region:rollup2

THE CENTRAL COAST WHERE THEY

03:26:08.690 --> 03:26:11.926 region:rollup2
SPEND THE WINTER. IN THE SPRING

03:26:10.191 --> 03:26:13.061 region:rollup2

BUT AS OUR BREEDING HABITAT IS

03:26:17.732 --> 03:26:20.301 region:rollup2
DECLINE THE NUMBERS FOR THE

03:26:18.900 --> 03:26:21.803 region:rollup2
WESTERN POPULATION HAVE DECLINED

03:26:20.301 --> 03:26:23.404 region:rollup2

THEY'RE DOWN TO TWO HUNDRED

03:26:28.977 --> 03:26:31.379 region:rollup2
THOUSAND WHICH IS ACTUALLY

03:26:29.878 --> 03:26:33.281 region:rollup2
DECLINE OF THIRTY PERCENT FROM

LAST YEAR.

03:26:33.281 --> 03:26:35.483 region:rollup2

PRIVATE PLANS BE IMPACTED.

03:36:49.930 --> 03:36:53.267 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I DON'T SEE WHERE THE

03:36:51.565 --> 03:36:56.971 region:rollup2
OTHER COMPONENT OF THIS IS THAT.

03:36:53.267 --> 03:36:58.339 region:rollup2
I'M WITH YOU HAVING ALSO.

03:36:56.971 --> 03:36:59.807 region:rollup2
ALSO BEING ONE OF THOSE WHO

03:37:12.086 --> 03:37:14.722 region:rollup2
I THINK WHAT WHAT THAT DID

03:37:13.354 --> 03:37:16.190 region:rollup2
DISTINCTION I'M TRYING TO MAKE

03:37:14.722 --> 03:37:18.792 region:rollup2
HERE IS THAT.

03:37:16.190 --> 03:37:20.561 region:rollup2
THE PRIVATE LANDOWNER CAN.

03:37:18.792 --> 03:37:21.495 region:rollup2
KEEP AN EYE ON THEIR OWN LAND

03:37:20.561 --> 03:37:21.996 region:rollup2
THEY CAN MONITOR THEIR LAND

03:37:21.495 --> 03:37:23.998 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT MORE.

03:37:21.996 --> 03:37:25.566 region:rollup2
THEN.

03:37:23.998 --> 03:37:27.701 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC LANDS WE NEED SOMEONE

03:37:25.566 --> 03:37:29.303 region:rollup2
TO ACTIVELY SURVEYED THE PUBLIC

03:37:27.701 --> 03:37:31.205 region:rollup2
LANDS TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON OUT

03:37:29.303 --> 03:37:34.008 region:rollup2
THERE. BECAUSE THEY'RE PUBLIC

03:37:31.205 --> 03:37:34.008 region:rollup2
LANDS AND THEY AND THEIR OWN BY

03:37:34.074 --> 03:37:37.511 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT. BUT WE DON'T HAVE

03:37:36.377 --> 03:37:39.647 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AT LIKE IT'S AT YOUR

03:37:42.750 --> 03:37:45.519 region:rollup2
MAKE REPORTS IN THE CAN BEFORE

03:37:44.718 --> 03:37:46.954 region:rollup2
THAT BUT THERE'S NO ONE

03:37:45.519 --> 03:37:48.522 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY TO AT THERE'S NO

03:37:46.954 --> 03:37:50.157 region:rollup2
MECHANISM. TO MAKE SURE WE

AND THAT'S WHAT I'M AFTER. OKAY

03:37:51.759 --> 03:37:55.930 region:rollup2
SO MAYBE THAT THE COMPROMISE

03:37:53.560 --> 03:37:57.498 region:rollup2
HERE IS MAYBE THE COMMITTEE

03:46:05.352 --> 03:46:08.522 region:rollup2
SO I JUST WANT TO FOCUS A LITTLE

03:46:06.386 --> 03:46:10.023 region:rollup2
BIT ON THE FACT THAT WE KNOW THE

03:46:08.522 --> 03:46:11.792 region:rollup2
MIGRATORY BIRDS ARE IN DECLINE

03:46:10.023 --> 03:46:12.426 region:rollup2
WILSON OF THE PROTECTIONS WORK.

03:46:11.792 --> 03:46:14.428 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE WANT TO DO THROUGH

03:46:12.426 --> 03:46:15.829 region:rollup2
THIS BILL IS INCENTIVIZE

03:46:14.428 --> 03:46:17.497 region:rollup2
PROTECTIONS TO BE PUT IN PLACE

03:46:15.829 --> 03:46:19.166 region:rollup2
AND TO CONTINUE.

03:46:17.497 --> 03:46:21.601 region:rollup2
TO BE CLEAR CURRENT CALIFORNIA

03:46:19.166 --> 03:46:23.637 region:rollup2
LAW PROHIBITS THE TAKING OF NON

03:46:21.601 --> 03:46:25.105 region:rollup2
GAME MIGRATORY BIRDS BUT LACKS

03:46:23.637 --> 03:46:26.907 region:rollup2
AWAY FOR INDUSTRY IT COULD OTHER

03:46:25.105 --> 03:46:28.442 region:rollup2
ENTITIES TO COMPLY.

03:46:26.907 --> 03:46:31.778 region:rollup2
AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN WOULD

03:46:28.442 --> 03:46:33.180 region:rollup2
PROVIDE THAT PATH FORWARD.

03:46:31.778 --> 03:46:35.048 region:rollup2
AS YOU SOME REMEMBER INDICATED

03:46:33.180 --> 03:46:36.450 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA MUST NOW STEP UP AS

03:46:35.048 --> 03:46:37.684 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL BILL REAL FEDERAL

03:46:36.450 --> 03:46:39.286 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT HAS ROLLED BACK IT'S

03:46:37.684 --> 03:46:40.387 region:rollup2
PROTECTIONS OF THE MBTA AND

03:46:39.286 --> 03:46:42.722 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY GOT AT THAT.

03:46:40.387 --> 03:46:44.057 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAS LAWS ON THE BOOKS

03:46:42.722 --> 03:46:46.560 region:rollup2
BUT IT NEEDS TO KNOW HOW TO MOVE

03:46:44.057 --> 03:46:48.128 region:rollup2
FORWARD IN AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY

03:46:46.560 --> 03:46:49.162 region:rollup2
SEVEN PROVIDES A PATH FORWARD.

03:46:48.128 --> 03:46:50.430 region:rollup2
A COUPLE MORE POINTS I JUST

03:46:49.162 --> 03:46:51.731 region:rollup2
WANNA MAKE ON IT IS ONE THAT AB

03:46:50.430 --> 03:46:52.699 region:rollup2
TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN DOES NOT

03:46:51.731 --> 03:46:54.434 region:rollup2
CREATE ANY NEW LEGAL

03:46:52.699 --> 03:46:56.369 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS.

03:46:54.434 --> 03:46:57.704 region:rollup2
RATHER IT PROVIDES A PATHWAY FOR

03:46:56.369 --> 03:46:59.739 region:rollup2
ENTITIES TO COMPLY WITH EXISTING

03:46:57.704 --> 03:47:01.274 region:rollup2
LAW.

03:46:59.739 --> 03:47:02.709 region:rollup2
AND IF THEY WANT TO THE NAY WILL

03:47:01.274 --> 03:47:05.178 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT THOSE BMPS HAVE BEEN

03:47:02.709 --> 03:47:06.413 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED BY DFW AND IT WELL

03:47:05.178 --> 03:47:08.615 region:rollup2
SELF CERTIFY THAT IT'S WITHIN

03:47:06.413 --> 03:47:09.649 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE.

03:47:08.615 --> 03:47:11.885 region:rollup2
WE WROTE THIS TO MINIMIZE THE

03:47:09.649 --> 03:47:13.787 region:rollup2
BURDEN TO DFW AND TO MIMIC A

03:47:11.885 --> 03:47:14.754 region:rollup2
PROCESS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL

03:47:13.787 --> 03:47:15.388 region:rollup2
WHICH SOUGHT A GENERAL PERMIT

03:47:14.754 --> 03:47:18.058 region:rollup2
UNDER THE MIGRATORY BIRD TREATY

03:47:15.388 --> 03:47:19.526 region:rollup2
ACT.

03:47:18.058 --> 03:47:20.827 region:rollup2
WITH THAT I'D WANT TO WRAP UP BY

03:47:19.526 --> 03:47:22.095 region:rollup2
JUST SAYING THAT WE HAVE BEEN IN

03:47:20.827 --> 03:47:23.263 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS WITH INDUSTRY TO TRY

03:47:22.095 --> 03:47:24.698 region:rollup2
TO IMPROVE THE LANGUAGE AND

03:47:23.263 --> 03:47:26.333 region:rollup2
ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS. WE WILL

03:47:24.698 --> 03:47:26.566 region:rollup2
CONTINUE THAT PROCESS GOING

03:47:26.333 --> 03:47:27.868 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

03:47:26.566 --> 03:47:29.136 region:rollup2
.

03:47:27.868 --> 03:47:30.670 region:rollup2
WE'RE ADDRESSING ISSUES FOR

03:47:29.136 --> 03:47:32.973 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE RELATED TO THE SCALE OF

03:47:30.670 --> 03:47:34.541 region:rollup2
THE IMPACTS SOUGHT TO US OR TO

03:47:32.973 --> 03:47:35.542 region:rollup2
BE REGULATED BY THE BMPS. THE

03:47:37.177 --> 03:47:41.715 region:rollup2
WITH THAT I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE

03:47:38.178 --> 03:47:43.817 region:rollup2

03:47:41.715 --> 03:47:44.584 region:rollup2
GOOD AFTERNOON A KIM DELFINO

03:47:43.817 --> 03:47:46.353 region:rollup2
WITH DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE.

03:47:44.584 --> 03:47:48.388 region:rollup2
I'LL JUST MAKE THIS QUICK

03:47:46.353 --> 03:47:49.856 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I THINK MIKE UP COVERED

03:47:48.388 --> 03:47:50.824 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THE POINTS I THINK THE

03:47:49.856 --> 03:47:51.858 region:rollup2
OF WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO

03:47:50.824 --> 03:47:53.693 region:rollup2
EMPHASIZE IS THAT WHEN THE

03:47:51.858 --> 03:47:55.128 region:rollup2
MIGRATORY BIRD TREATY ACT. WAS

03:47:53.693 --> 03:47:57.164 region:rollup2
INTERPRETED BY THE FISH FISH

03:47:55.128 --> 03:47:59.099 region:rollup2
WILDLIFE SERVICE AS PROHIBITING

03:47:57.164 --> 03:48:01.301 region:rollup2
INCIDENTAL TAKE IT REALLY TRUE

03:47:59.099 --> 03:48:02.502 region:rollup2
DROVE A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS AT

03:48:01.301 --> 03:48:04.037 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL LEVEL WHERE

03:48:02.502 --> 03:48:06.139 region:rollup2
INDUSTRIES WORKED WITH THE

03:48:04.037 --> 03:48:08.175 region:rollup2
SERVICE AND OTHERS TO COME UP

03:48:06.139 --> 03:48:09.943 region:rollup2
WITH VARIOUS GUIDELINES. FOR

03:48:08.175 --> 03:48:10.377 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE THE NGUYEN GUIDELINES

03:48:09.943 --> 03:48:12.412 region:rollup2
THE.

03:48:10.377 --> 03:48:14.948 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATION TOWER SITING

03:48:12.412 --> 03:48:15.849 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES AND THE AVIAN

03:48:14.948 --> 03:48:17.918 region:rollup2
POWERLINE GUIDELINES

03:48:15.849 --> 03:48:20.687 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY DID THIS BECAUSE THEY

03:48:17.918 --> 03:48:23.089 region:rollup2
KNEW THAT THEY. WERE RISKING A

03:48:20.687 --> 03:48:24.324 region:rollup2
BY NOT A PRO ACTIVELY WORKING

03:48:23.089 --> 03:48:25.292 region:rollup2
WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

03:48:24.324 --> 03:48:27.527 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL.

03:48:25.292 --> 03:48:28.895 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS FOR

03:48:27.527 --> 03:48:30.797 region:rollup2
PROJECTS THAT WERE RESULTING IN

03:48:28.895 --> 03:48:32.532 region:rollup2
INCIDENT TAKE WITH THE FEDERAL

03:48:30.797 --> 03:48:33.099 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT STEPPING BACK NOW AND

03:48:32.532 --> 03:48:35.068 region:rollup2
REVERSING A HUNDRED YEARS OF

03:48:33.099 --> 03:48:36.670 region:rollup2
LAW.

03:48:35.068 --> 03:48:37.938 region:rollup2
AND SAY NO LONGER DOES THE

03:48:36.670 --> 03:48:39.506 region:rollup2
MIGRATORY BIRD TREATY ACT

03:48:37.938 --> 03:48:41.775 region:rollup2
PROHIBIT INCIDENTAL TAKE THEY

03:48:39.506 --> 03:48:43.043 region:rollup2
HAVE NOW REMOVED ANY INCENTIVE

03:48:41.775 --> 03:48:44.678 region:rollup2
TO CONTINUE THAT COLLABORATIVE

03:48:43.043 --> 03:48:46.413 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

03:48:44.678 --> 03:48:49.382 region:rollup2
I'M AS MR LINES ALREADY POINTED

03:48:46.413 --> 03:48:50.850 region:rollup2
OUT. THE CALIFORNIA CODE ALREADY

03:48:49.382 --> 03:48:53.019 region:rollup2
CONTAINS A PROHIBITION ON

03:48:50.850 --> 03:48:54.955 region:rollup2
INCIDENTAL TAKE OF MIGRATORY

03:48:53.019 --> 03:48:56.957 region:rollup2
BIRDS BUT IT DIDN'T DO ANY MORE

03:48:54.955 --> 03:48:58.058 region:rollup2
THAN THAT. AND FOR MANY YEARS

03:48:56.957 --> 03:48:59.960 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WILDLIFE

03:48:58.058 --> 03:49:00.994 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY DEFERRED TO THE US

03:48:59.960 --> 03:49:01.995 region:rollup2
FISH WILDLIFE SERVICE IN THE

03:49:00.994 --> 03:49:03.830 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO TO

03:49:01.995 --> 03:49:05.932 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY TAKE CARE OF THE

03:49:03.830 --> 03:49:07.100 region:rollup2
MIGRATORY BIRDS IN THAT SETTING.

03:49:05.932 --> 03:49:08.235 region:rollup2
BUT NOW THAT THE CALIFORNIA

03:49:07.100 --> 03:49:09.936 region:rollup2
PARTNER FISHING WHILE IT DOES

03:49:08.235 --> 03:49:11.304 region:rollup2
HAVE TO SET UP AND THEN STAND P

03:49:09.936 --> 03:49:13.106 region:rollup2
AND THAT THIS PRACTICE BILLS SET

03:49:11.304 --> 03:49:15.742 region:rollup2
UP A PROCESS. THAT CONTINUES

03:49:13.106 --> 03:49:17.277 region:rollup2
THAT COLLABORATIVE DROPPED

03:49:15.742 --> 03:49:19.813 region:rollup2
COLLABORATIVE EFFORT.

03:49:17.277 --> 03:49:21.648 region:rollup2
UP PROCESS BY ALLOWING FOR SELF

03:49:19.813 --> 03:49:23.383 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATION AND THE

03:49:21.648 --> 03:49:24.718 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT OF ADDITIONAL.

03:49:23.383 --> 03:49:26.419 region:rollup2
BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE

03:49:24.718 --> 03:49:28.255 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES AND SO IT ACTUALLY

03:49:26.419 --> 03:49:29.956 region:rollup2
GIVES A PLACE FOR BOTH THE

03:49:28.255 --> 03:49:31.257 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT AND INDUSTRY AND

03:49:29.956 --> 03:49:32.959 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS TO WORK THROUGH

03:49:31.257 --> 03:49:34.828 region:rollup2
THESE ISSUES AGAIN IN A

03:49:32.959 --> 03:49:36.796 region:rollup2
COLLABORATIVE MANNER. AND SO FOR

03:49:34.828 --> 03:49:38.798 region:rollup2
THAT REASON WE BELIEVE THIS IS A

03:49:36.796 --> 03:49:40.567 region:rollup2
COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO DEALING

03:49:38.798 --> 03:49:42.068 region:rollup2
WITH AN UNFORTUNATE PROBLEM THAT

03:49:40.567 --> 03:49:43.903 region:rollup2
HAS NOW BEEN PLACED AT THE FEET

03:49:42.068 --> 03:49:46.239 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA THROUGH A FEDERAL

03:49:43.903 --> 03:49:49.142 region:rollup2
ROLE BACK. ON AND AGAIN WE LOOK

03:49:46.239 --> 03:49:49.142 region:rollup2
FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE

03:49:49.209 --> 03:49:52.612 region:rollup2
MOVES FORWARD TO ADDRESS WHAT OF

03:49:51.111 --> 03:49:53.913 region:rollup2
THEIR ADDITIONAL CONCERNS ARE

03:49:52.612 --> 03:49:55.715 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S A VERY

03:49:53.913 --> 03:49:57.183 region:rollup2
WORKABLE. A PROCESS I THINK

03:49:55.715 --> 03:49:58.885 region:rollup2
THERE'S GONNA BE CONCERNS RAISED

03:49:57.183 --> 03:50:00.020 region:rollup2
ABOUT DEPREDATION PERMITS I

03:49:58.885 --> 03:50:02.222 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK THAT WE ARE A

03:50:00.020 --> 03:50:04.057 region:rollup2
INTENDED MAKING IT HARD. TO GET

03:50:02.222 --> 03:50:05.892 region:rollup2
DEPREDATION PERMITS AT ALL ON

03:50:04.057 --> 03:50:07.827 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK THESE ARE THINGS

03:50:05.892 --> 03:50:09.296 region:rollup2
THAT ARE VERY EASILY ADDRESSED

03:50:07.827 --> 03:50:10.563 region:rollup2
SO FOR THAT REASON WE WOULD URGE

03:50:09.296 --> 03:50:12.732 region:rollup2
HER AYE VOTE. THANK YOU.

03:55:16.669 --> 03:55:18.838 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT TOO FAR.

03:55:17.136 --> 03:55:20.173 region:rollup2
THE PENDULUM IS SWINGING

03:55:18.838 --> 03:55:20.873 region:rollup2

03:55:35.922 --> 03:55:38.691 region:rollup2

ALL OF OUR PROJECTS CERTAINLY

03:55:50.003 --> 03:55:53.506 region:rollup2
