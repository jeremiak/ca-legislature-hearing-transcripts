TONY THURMOND STATE SUPERINTENDENT. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU. NOW THE BUDGET- I LIKE TO FIRST START BY ACKNOWLEDGING OUR STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES THEIR EDUCATORS FOR THEIR RESILIENCE THIS IS CERTAINLY MY ESTIMATION THE TOUGHEST EXPERIENCE THE MOST EXPERIENCE IN OUR LIFETIME I DON'T EAT UNTIL YOU HEAR FROM YOUR CONSTITUENTS IT MOST OF OUR SCHOOLS FIND THEMSELVES STILL IN DISTANCE LEARNING STRUGGLING TO KEEP STUDENTS SAFE. STRUGGLING TO DEAL WITH MANY OF THE CHALLENGES OF THE PANDEMIC- FIRES UNFORTUNATELY NOW MUDSLIDES POWER SAFETY SHUT OFF IN MANY CHALLENGES THAT OUR STUDENTS. IT'S I KNEW TO ACKNOWLEDGE- YOUR WORDS OF THIS BUDGET AND WHAT THIS OPPORTUNITY CAN MEAN FOR OUR SCHOOLS THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN OPEN ARE STRUGGLING TO STAY OPEN THOSE THAT WANT TO BE OPEN NEED RESOURCES IN THIS BUDGET PROPOSES RESOURCES THAT CAN BE IMPORTANT TO THEM- I COULD BE TESTING. IN PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR EFFORTS PROVIDE TO FIVE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS TO OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN LEARNING LOSS MITIGATION FUNDS THAT THEY'VE USED TO PURCHASE COMPUTERS IN THE THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS. IN THE MONTHS SINCE PANDEMIC ARE ARE OFFICE WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT CITY ADDRESS MANY CHALLENGES. LIKE CLOSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE WE WILL COVER THAT- IN THIS PANDEMIC THAT A MILLION STUDENTS LACK ACCESS TO HIGH SPEED INTERNET. ESPECIALLY IN A RULE COMMUNITIES. WHERE THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR INTERNET AND BROADBAND DOESN'T EXIST- BUT ALSO IN MANY OF OUR DISTRICTS. WHICH HAS EXACERBATED CONNECTION FOR STUDENTS LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS WHO HAVE NOT CHECKED IN- WE SEEN CHALLENGES IN ATTENDANCE OUR OFFICE HAS WORKED WITH MANY OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO IDENTIFY THE STUDENTS. TO TRY TO PROVIDE THEM SUPPORT MANY OF THESE FAMILIES WE KNOW WE'RE DEALING WITH FOOD INSECURITY- HOUSING INSTABILITY AND OTHER CHALLENGES AS LOVED ONES MAY HAVE LOST IT YEAH. AND SADLY MAYBE EVEN LOST SOMEONE TO COVERT BUT WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT OUR DISTRICTS IN THIS WAY IN THIS TIME OF. DO YOU PROVIDE RESOURCE AND WOMEN. LITERALLY- OVER A HUNDRED. ON EVERY TOPIC THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE. INCLUDING HOW TO DELIVER SOCIAL EMOTIONAL. RESOURCESTO OUR STUDENTS AND CONNECTING DISTRICTS WITH PROVIDERS WHO CAN PROVIDE DIRECT MENTAL HEALTH AND SPORTS. YOUR STUDENTS WE KNOW THAT DURING THE PANDEMIC. DEPRESSION HAS BEEN ON THE RISE YEAH WE KNOW THAT OUR STUDENTS NEED AS MUCH SUPPORT AS WE CAN PROVIDE THEM. SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME TALKING ABOUT HOW TO STRENGTHEN DISTANCE LEARNING. YOU KNOW AGAIN COMMENDING OUR EDUCATORS FOR ALL THEIR EFFORTS TO LEAD IN. BUT IS AN UNAVOIDABLE FACT THAT FOR MANY OF OUR STUDENTS THEY HAVE EXPERIENCE LEARNING GAPS MANY OF THESE ARE THE SEVEN STUDENTS FOR WHOM WE WERE TRYING TO CLOSE. LEARNING GAPS EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC THOSE LEARNING GAP NOW EXACERBATED BY THE PANDEMIC AND SO WE'VE PROVIDED GREAT RESOURCES TO OUR SCHOOLS AND WEBINARS AS RECENT AS LAST WEEK WITH A THOUSAND EDUCATORS. SHOWING THEM WAYS TO MAKE DISTANCE LEARNING BETTER- BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT UNTIL WE CAN OPEN ALL OF OUR SCHOOLS THAT THAT IS THE KEY THAT WE'VE GOT TO. FIGURE OUT WAYS TO IMPROVE LET'S FACE IT EDUCATION WAS NOT BUILT TO DELIVER EDUCATION BY REMOTE. OUR SYSTEMS WERE BUILT THAT WAY SO WE'VE GOT PROVIDE MORE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR EDUCATORS SUPPORT FOR FAMILIES IN THE DEEPEST LEVELS OF FAMILY ENGAGEMENT THAT WE CAN. SO FAMILIES ARE CONNECTED TO OUR SCHOOLS AND IN THAT WAY WE CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THESE WEBINARS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING CONVERSATIONS. ABOUT ADDITIONAL STEPS THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN TAKE TO ACCELERATE LEARNING AND TO HELP TO CLOSE LEARNING GAPS THAT HAVE BEEN EXACERBATED DURING THIS CONDEMNED. WE ADDRESS THE ISSUES AROUND HATE. S. RACES THAT MANY OUR STUDENTS THAT WITNESS WE WORKED. TO PROVIDE GRANT RIGHT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ADDRESS EQUITY GAS. AND TO PROVIDE WHAT WE CALL EDUCATION. AND HATE ADDRESSING THINGS LIKE ANTI SEMITISM AND RACISM- AND PROVIDING WAYS TO USE EDUCATION AS AN IMPORTANT. TOOL AND HATE I WANT TO QUICKLY KNOWLEDGE SOME OF THE KEY INVESTMENTS. IN THIS BUDGET. WE APPRECIATE THAT IT HAS SOME OF THE HIGHEST INVESTMENT THAT WE HAVE SEEN EVER. FOR K. TWELVE EDUCATION INCLUDING THE EIGHTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. IN PROP NINETY EIGHT SPENDING. FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT OUR EDUCATOR WORK FORCE- A COLD TO SUPPORT. THE RISING OF EDUCATION AND TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. I CANNOT UNDERSCORE MORE FOR YOU AS YOU DISCUSS AND DEBATE AND ULTIMATELY BOTH. ON SOME OF THE ITEMS THAT ARE IN THE BUDGET INCLUDING SOME OF THE EARLY ACTION ITEMS. HOW MUCH SUPPORT OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS STILL MEET. THEY NEED ACCESS TO CORPORATE TESTING IN PP SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE THE CONDITIONS TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO REOPEN FOR THE SCHOOLS THAT ARE OPEN TO STAY OPEN. I KNOW THAT THERE ARE THINGS IN THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT MANY OF YOUR QUESTION SOME OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT QUESTION. BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT UNTIL WE GET THE VACCINE. THERE'S NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT THAN PROVIDING OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT WITH THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED TO PROVIDE US COBIT TESTING. TO PUT IT IN CONTEXT WE HAVE SCHOOLS THAT ARE OPEN ARE SERVING STUDENTS THAT ARE SEEING HIGH NUMBERS OF STUDENTS RETURN TO SCHOOL OFTEN A CINEMATIC. IMPALA DIFFICULT IN ORDER FOR US TO PROTECT OUR STUDENTS IN THEIR EDUCATORS AND THEIR FAMILIES OUR SCHOOLS WILL NEED TO HAVE THOSE RESOURCES THAT ARE IN THIS PROPOSED BUDGET FOR EARLY ACTION. FOR COVERT TESTING AND I WOULD JUST ECHO THE IMPORTANCE OF DOWN IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS TO COME HOPE YOU'LL JOIN US. WE ARE CONTINUING OUR WEB IN OUR SERIES. ON HOW TO STRENGTHEN DISTANCE LEARNING. WE ARE. HAVING A HEARING. ON CLOSING DIGITAL DIVIDE WE CAN. A NUMBER HAVE SOLUTIONS. FOR CLOSING THE BROAD GAP. IN WILL BE WORKING WITH ALL THE EQUITY ADVOCATES LIKE A TRUST WEST. IN WOMEN ARE ON A DRESSING EQUITY GAPS GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF WHAT'S IN THIS BUDGET THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK CLOSELY WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF. ON HOW WE SUPPORT OUR THOUSAND DISTRICTS. CONCLUDE MY REMARKS HERE AND SUBMIT MYSELF FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SUPERINTENDENT SO YOU DO HAVE TIME FOR SOME QUESTIONS THAT WE WERE TOLD YOU HAD TO LEAVE I KNOW I HAVE A COUPLE AND SOME OTHER MEMBERS DO AS WELL DO YOU HAVE TIME. MISTER THURMAN. YES SIR OKAY- LET ME FOCUS ON YOU KNOW THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM IN THE SCHOOL THE QUESTION ACROSS CALIFORNIA THAT'S- REOPENING OUR SCHOOLS. AND SO CERTAINLY. WE SOUGHT YEAH GOOD NEWS THIS WEEK THE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED THAT HE'S LIFTING THE STAY AT HOME ORDER- MANY COUNTIES HAVE GONE- YOU KNOW. ARE ARE STILL IN THE PURPLE BUT OUR CAR HEADING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND YOU KNOW. THAT I KNOW MR GALLAGHER ASKED THAT QUESTION YESTERDAY IS LIKE A WE HAVE RESTAURANTS OPEN AND- PEOPLE CAN GO OUTSIDE BUT- WE CAN'T GO BACK TO SCHOOL- SO. I THAT I THINK WE'RE WORKING ON THAT SO. MISTER SUPERINTENDENT WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE THE IMMEDIATE. NECESSARY STEPS- TO. TO GET OUR KIDS. AND EDUCATORS SAFELY. BACK TO SCHOOL WHETHER IT'S FALLING IN PERSON A HYBRID SMALL COHORTS WHAT HAVE YOU. THIS YEAR I THINK THAT THAT ACCESS TO ROBUST COVERT TESTING. IS KEY OBVIOUSLY THE VACCINE IS THE GAME CHANGER AND IF WE HAD ENOUGH DOSES TO VACCINATE OUR EDUCATORS THAT WOULD BE THE MOST. IMPORTANT EFFECTIVE WAY TO GET OUR SCHOOLS OKAY WE ALL KNOW THAT WE JUST DON'T HAVE THOSE DOSES AND UNTIL THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN PROCURE THEM FOR US- ROBERT S. COLEMAN NINETEEN TESTING IN CONTACT TRACING. IS CERTAINLY THE MOST IMPORTANT. OKAY I KNOW THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE DISCUSSION OF THE GOVERNOR'S RE OPENING PROPOSAL IN THAT IT CONTAINS A PROVISION FOR TWO BILLION DOLLARS. FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO BE TO GET THE CO PROTECTING I WOULD SUBMIT THAT THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING I'M EITHER MANY ELEMENTS WHEN YOU DISCUSS. HOW WE CAN YOU KNOW ADDRESS OFFSETTING LEARNING GAPS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE BUT TO YOUR QUESTION I THINK THE ACCESS TO KOBE TESTING IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENT THE STAR. OKAY I'M- FURTHER QUESTIONS. MISTER MEDINA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OUR STATE SUPERINTENDENT I AM I CORRECT IN UNDERSTANDING THAT THE STATE'S ALLOCATION TO. FOOD OR NUTRITION- EXPIRED. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SCHOOL YEAR. THE WE WORK WITH OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS PROVIDE MEALS IT. HUNDREDS OF SITES ALL ACROSS THE STATE- AND WE CONTINUE TO DO THAT- WE ALSO HAVE- WORK CLOSELY WITH OTHER DEPARTMENTS FOR WHAT'S CALLED- THE PANDEMIC EBT WHICH PROVIDES MORE BENEFITS TO FAMILIES- TO THE EBT PROGRAM- I'M NOT SURE SPECIFICALLY WHICH ASPECT OF NUTRITION FUNDING. THAT YOU REFERRED TO THAT MAY HAVE EXPIRED BUT IF YOU PUT ME IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I WOULD BE HAPPY TO GET THAT INFORMATION TO PROVIDE THAT FOR YOU I HAVE HERE IN FRONT OF ME THAT THERE IS NO OF. PROPOSED FOR NUTRITION PROGRAMS BY THE STATE- IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. AND IF THAT IS THE CASE. I WOULD HOPE THAT THE STATE WOULD WOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT ABOUT THAT AS WE ALL UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF FOOD AND NUTRITION TO THE KIDS TO THE CHILDREN OF DURING THIS PANDEMIC. BUT I APPRECIATE YOU GETTING BACK TO ME- HERE MY STAFF HAS ALREADY SENT ME A RESPONSE THAT THERE'S A HUNDRED THIRTEEN MILLION IN THE BUDGET FOR NUTRITION. THERE HAD BEEN. A REIMBURSEMENT THAT EXPIRED BACK IN AUGUST- A NEW HUNDRED THIRTEEN MILLION IS IN THE BUDGET FOR NUTRITION RIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YES QUESTION FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER VIA THAT IS. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND- GET YOUR AND RECOMMENDATION AND MEETINGS HAVE. NEW HERE. I'M TO GET THAT THE YOU MISTER TO GET TO YOUR AND RECOMMENDED OF TESTING IS THERE A SCHOOL OR A DISTRICT THAT IS CURRENTLY OPEN IN UTILIZING A COMPREHENSIVE TESTING PROGRAM THAT'S WORKING IN FACT HAS PROVEN TO MITIGATE TRANSMISSION IN SCHOOLS. THE QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER I WOULD SAY THAT- PROBABLY LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS THE MOST ROBUST TESTING PROGRAM. EVEN WITH THAT TESTING PROGRAM THEY'VE ACTUALLY GONE OUT AND CONTRACTED WITH THE VENDOR. THAT CAN PROVIDE CO THE TESTING I EVEN WITH THAT PROGRAM THEY PROJECT THAT ONE IN THREE STUDENTS HAVE COME TO THEIR SCHOOL- HOW ARE PONDERED FOR COVERT. BUT A SYMPTOMATIC IN SO THE REALLY SPEAKS TO THE NEED FOR KOBE TESTING TO REALLY ENABLE SCHOOLS TO BE OPEN NOW I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE MANY COUNTIES. WHERE SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN OPEN SINCE THE FALL IN I WOULD SAY IN THEIR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN MAKE SOME. I WOULD SAY LET OKAY- NAPA COUNTY MARIN COUNTY. THEY CERTAINLY TALK ABOUT. THERE EXT. BM STAY OPENS THE FALL MINIMAL ARE INCREASING GREAT EXCEPTION- OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN PLACES LIKE SACRAMENTO COUNTY WE'VE HEARD STORIES OF. SCHOOLS OPENING AND THEN HAPPEN TO CLOSE BECAUSE THEY'VE SEEN AN INCREASE IN A COVERT TESTING. THE RESEARCH THAT WE LOOKED AT THE NATION AND REALLY THROUGHOUT THE WORLD- SUGGESTS THERE AGAIN IT'S THE RESULTS ARE MIXED SOME COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAINTAIN. SMALL OR MINIMIZE THE SPRING- WHEN SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN OPENED OTHERS HAVE NOT. BY MOST ACCOUNTS WHAT WE SEE IS OUR BEST EFFORT DISTINCT OPEN SCHOOLS IN PERSON IN SMALLER GRADES K. THROUGH SIX. IN THAT. IT RELATES TO MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL OTHER THAT CAN BE HIGHER RATES OF TRANSMISSION AGAIN AND THIS IS ALL BASED ON RESEARCH I'M NOT AN EPIDEMIOLOGIST BUT WE'VE BEEN IN CONVERSATION WITH MANY OF THEM- IN THIS IS WHAT THE RESEARCH HAS TOLD US. IN THIS IS WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM MANY PARK DISTRICTS WHEN THEY SAID MORE THAN ANYTHING IS THEY WANT HELP THEY NEED DOLLARS TO GET ACCESS TO CORRECT I THINK. THEY WANT ACCESS TO INFORMATION FROM% HEALTH EXPERTS ON WHAT THE TESTING INTERVAL SHOULD BE AND HOW TO GO ABOUT TESTING IN. CONTEXT RACING TO KEEP EVERYONE SAFE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF DONALD- YES AND I THINK YOU MISTER SUPERINTENDENT IF ANYONE WANTS TO LOOK AT A TESTING PROGRAM LOOK AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL. THE TWO BILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL HE PUT ON JANUARY THIRTY THAT ACTUALLY DOES HAVE A TESTING PROGRAM. THE CADENCE IS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR COLOR. RATHER THAN- CASES CASE RATES ETCETERA. IN YOUR IN YOUR COUNTY SO THAT THEY THAT IS A PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE TESTING PROGRAM THAT HE LAID OUT. IN HIS IN HIS PROPOSAL BACK IN JANUARY AND- PEOPLE ARE BEATING THE WHOLE PROPOSAL UP. FOR VERY REASONS BUT THERE'S A LOT OF TESTING IN THERE. IT'S IN THERE AND AGAIN IT'S ASSOCIATED. WITH THE COLOR YOUR COUNTY MAY BE AN- AND THERE'S MONEY TO- PROBABLY NOT ENOUGH IF YOU'RE IN THE PURPLE PROBABLY. MAYBE EVEN TOO MUCH OF YOUR IN THE L. QUITE FRANKLY BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE THAT TEST REQUIREMENT TO. PERFORM THE TESTING CANES. AND YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT TESTING YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT DATA TRANSPARENCY WITH REGARD TO COVER CASES. WHICH ARE BOTH TALKED IN. TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. IN A PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE MANNER THANK YOU. THANK WOULD AGREE WITH THIS MEMBER. TO WOULD ALLOW FOR MANY DISTRICTS TO ENGAGE IN A WEEKLY CALL THE TESTING- WE ALSO APPRECIATE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IN ADDITION TO THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS CREATES REQUIREMENT FOR REPORTING- THAT DOESN'T CURRENTLY EXIST AND IT'S SAD TO SAY THAT IN A STATE WITH THE THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE ALL RUN LOCALLY WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE KIND OF SYSTEMS THAT ALLOW US. TO HAVE REAL TIME DATA FROM SCHOOL DISTRICTS WE LITERALLY ARE SURVEYING THROUGH COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS WHO THEN GO TO THEIR INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS BUT WE WOULD AGREE- THAT EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT SOME OF THE DETAILS OF THE RE OPENING PROPOSAL WE THINK THAT BY AND LARGE. THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPONENTS THAT WE HOPE YOU WILL SUPPORT IS THE TWO BILLION DOLLAR. PROJECT THANK YOU AT WORK WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM AND A MOMENT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ABOUT THAT BUT MAYBE YOU CAN. YOU CAN A PINE ON THE FEEDBACK WE'RE GETTING FROM DISTRICTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA AS ABOUT THIS TWO BILLION PROPOSAL AND- AND WHETHER IT'S WORKABLE OR NOT AND SOME LARGER DISTRICTS HAVE HAVE OUTLINED. SOME FLAWS IN THAT DID NEVER BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THAT SO DO YOU HAVE A RESPONSE TO THAT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN WE WE'VE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THOSE DISTRICTS THAT RAISE CONCERN- IN THE CONCERNS HAVE RANGED FROM- FEELING THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH FUNDING- WELL YOU KNOW WHAT WHICH IS LEGITIMATE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS AND STAFF THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- BUT- I DON'T SEE THAT AS A REASON TO NOT SUPPORT THE TO THE- BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT. AND IT'S A GOOD START AND IN MANY WAYS. IT'S A GREAT H. TO MARCH AND WE ARE STATEREASON I SAY BRIDGE TOMORROW JUST BECAUSE WE KNOW WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS ALREADY ESTABLISHED- A HUNDRED DAY TIMELINE. TO GET SHOOLS OPEN HAS TALKED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF MOVING FROM A HUNDRED MILLION VACCINATIONS. A DAY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY. NO MILLION TAX ASIANS. SO WE THANK THAT- WHY THEIR CONCERNS THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS. AND WE THINK THAT THIS IS A BRING. TO WHEN I'M TAXING DOSES. ARE TASA. THERE ARE QUESTIONS THAT SOME HAVE RAISED ABOUT THE TESTING INTERVAL- I THINK ALSO TIED.TO FUNDING. BUT BY MOST ACCOUNTS TESTING WEEKLY OR EVEN EVERY OTHER WEEK. GIVES US THE INFORMATION TO ENSURE THAT OUR STUDENTS AND STAFF WILL BE STAY. WHEN THEY RETURN TO SCHOOL A MESSAGE I BELIEVE THAT THE CONCERN THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED CAN BE ADDRESSED. IN WE ARE PERSONALLY BEEN INVOLVED IN CONVERSATION BETWEEN SOME OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE CAMPS OFFICE AND MANY OF YOU. TO TRY TO FIND WAYS TO ADDRESS. SOME OF THE DETAILS. AND I THINK WE CAN WORK THROUGH THE DAY. OF BUT I THINK THAT THE PROPOSAL- BY AND LARGE- HAS A SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT TO OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND I THINK THAT THE FEEDBACK WE'RE GETTING FROM OUR DISTRICTS IS- THEY'RE HELPING TO SHAPE. AND WE SHOULD LISTEN TO THEM TO SHAPING US THAT WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY MEETS THEIR NEEDS GOING FOR. MR TANG. MR TO PROTECT A GOOD TO SEE YOU- JUST THE FULL QUESTION SO- YOUR WITH A LETTER FROM THE SEVEN LARGEST DISTRICTS IN THE STATE SAYING THAT THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS WOULDN'T ALLOW THEM TO OPEN DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF- GIVE A SENSE OF WHAT HOW MANY DISTRICTS WOULD ACTUALLY BE OPEN FOR ME IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO APPROPRIATE THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS AND THEN NOT SEE CHILDREN GOING BACK TO SCHOOL. AND THEN WE IN REGARDS TO THE SEVEN LARGEST DISTRICTS DO A SENSE OF WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO- MOVE THOSE DISTRICTS OR WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO ASSIST THOSE DISTRICTS TO OPEN UP. FIFTY TWO THE STATE A CERTAIN. AS I UNDER IT THOSE DISTRICTS HAVE INDICATED A DESIRE. FOR MORE STATE STANDARDS CAN BE ARTICULATED. DOWN OPENING NOW I SUSPECT THAT THERE'S SOME A BIT OF A GAP BETWEEN WHAT THE DISTRICTS ARE ASKING FOR WHAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED BECAUSE THE PROPOSALDOES CREATE SOME STANDARDS IT IT TALKS ABOUT THAT TESTING INTERVALS THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT- TO BE MAY I STILL THINK THAT THERE'S ROOM FOR ADDITIONAL CONVERSATION I BELIEVE THAT MOST DISTRICTS WOULD AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THE FUNDING BUT SOME HAVE SAID. THAT THE MONEY WOULDN'T BE ENOUGH WHERE THEY HAD ISSUES WITH SOME OF THE TIMELINE DISTRICTS HAVE RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT SOME RECENT GUIDANCE THAT HAS BEEN PUT OUT BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THAT CHANGES WHAT IT WOULD TAKE FOUR DIFFERENT THAT'S NOT OPEN TO OPEN BUT AS I UNDERSTAND IT FROM THE GOVERNOR AND GOVERNOR STAFF THAT THEY'RE. WORKING TO ADJUST THOSE. ASPECTS OF THE- BECAUSE THEY WANT MORE IMPORTANTLY WANT WITH ANYONE SEE OUR SCHOOLS BE OPEN SO. ASSEMBLY MEETING I THINK THAT IT IS POSSIBLE- TO WORK THROUGH SOME OF THESE CONCERNS I KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HAS BEEN IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH A NUMBER OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT RAISE CONCERN- AND I THINK THAT ALTERNATELY THE PROPOSAL SHOULD BE SUPPORTED- BUT SOME. REVISIONS GET MADE TO BEST MEET THE NEEDS OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THANK YOU MISTER SUPPORTER I THINK THAT'S WHAT NOT THIS COMMITTEES BEEN SAYING FOR. FOR QUITE A WHILE THE FACT WE HAD A HEARING ON IN THE FALL. WITH THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH AND JUST REITERATING. HOW CRITICAL THOSE GUIDELINES WERE IN JUST HEARING FROM. MANY OF OUR OUR SCHOOLS ON OUR PERCENT WHEN THE LARGE SCHOOL DISTRICTS- STATING HOW THERE NEED TO BE CLEARER MORE SPECIFIC MORE DIRECTIVE AND GUIDANCE FROM DPH AND- I THINK WILDER MOST RECENT GUIDANCE WAS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION- IT'S STILL NOT. QUITE ALL THE WAY THERE ARE SOME I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE CONTINUES TO BE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE- WITH THE DISTRICTS TO. REALLY FIND A VERY CLEAR- DIRECTIVE PATH FORWARD SO THAT DISTRICTS. CAN CAN KNOW WHAT DIRECTION TO FOLLOW I THINK THAT'S ALL THEY'RE LOOKING FOR THEY'RE LOOKING FOR GUIDANCE. FROM PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS AS YOU KNOW YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS ON YOUR STAFF. DISTRICTS DON'T HAVE THE- RESOURCES TO A PUBLIC OFFICIAL HELP PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS ON THEIR STAFF THAT THEY REALLY. ARE LOOKING TO THE STATE AND ALL THE DIFFERENT COUNTY ALL COUNTY PUBLIC. HEALTH OFFICES FOR GUIDANCE THANK YOU. THANK YOU I AB TWO AGREE SO MEMBER TO AND I THINK. THAT WHAT WHAT THE- FROM OUR LARGEST DISTRICTS IS TELLING US IS THAT. REALLY NOONE REALLY KNOWS HOW TO DO THIS THIS IS A MOMENT THAT NONE OF US HAVE BEEN IN BEFORE. IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IS PUTTING OUT GUIDANCE THEY WILL ALSO OFFERED THAT THEY WILL PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. TO ANY DISTRICT IT NEEDS MORE HELP- THEY'VE OPENED UP THE VALENCIA LAB WHICH HAS WORKED WITH. MANY OF OUR COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS TO. OUTLINE THE PROCESS FOR HOW TO GET TESTING IN PLACE ACTUALLY TO HELP IN PROCESSING COBA TESTING. IN SO IT'S BUMPY BUT I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN GET THERE AS LONG AS WE CONTINUE THE COMMUNICATION AND- APPRECIATE THE FEEDBACK FROM YOU AND- MANY OTHERS IN THE SPOT. YEAH THANK YOU BEFORE I GET O AYE MR FONG I JUST WANTED TO JUMP ON THAT SO WE HEAR HER I HEARD YOU TALKING ABOUT- GUIDANCE TESTING VACCINES ARE VACCINES IS OF COURSE OUT OF OUR CONTROL A LITTLE BIT. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DISTRIBUTION AND THE MANUFACTURERS YOU KNOW POPPING OUT ENOUGH. THAT THAT GUIDANCE CERTAINLY WE'RE WORKING ON THE TESTING IS A THING THAT I THINK IS INTERESTING BECAUSE WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A MONEY PROBLEM WE HAVE A- INFUSION OF CASH RIGHT NOW PROP NINETY EIGHT. IT COULD EVEN GET MORE THIS NEW FEDERAL- PACKAGE IF IT GOES THROUGH WHO KNOWS IF THEY'RE GONNA. ADOPT WENT PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS PROPOSED BUT THAT'S LIKE. THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS WHAT SO. AND IT'S TO ME THAT THE TWO. YOU CAN. GET THE OF THEIR- WITH WE RESOURCE AND SO WELL I HAVE HEARD ABOUT CATHOLIC SCHOOLS HERE IN SACRAMENTO WHO HAVE DONE THIS. AMAZING TESTING PROGRAM IS EXPENSIVE SO. IT IF WE HAD THAT RESOURCES TO DO THAT DID THAT WOULD THAT BE ENOUGH. TO GET GOING SOONER. IN YOUR OPINION. YOU KNOW THIS IS YOUR I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT THE- INABILITY TO ACCESS TESTING IT'S ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF THE BIGGEST BARRIERS TO OUR SCHOOLS OPENING EVEN GOING BACK TO THE FALL. IN IN SO WE'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT TESTING WAS NEEDED UNFORTUNATELY THE SURGE HAS. SO AS YOU SAY VACCINES BE GAMES- BUT UNTIL WE HAVE IT COVERT TESTING IS THE WAY TO GO OUT THERE ARE A LOT OF THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS HAVE FOR THEIR OWN TASK. LARGER DISTRICTS HAVE PAID FOR THEIR OWN CONTRACTS SMALLER DISTRICTS IN OTHER DISHES JUST DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO SO THEY NEED SUPPORT- AND I BELIEVE THAT THE REQUESTED THEY BE OPENING PROPOSAL IS A WARRANTY. ONE TO HELP. BITING THAT TESTING YEAH. THIS O'DONNELL'S A QUICK FOLLOW UP TO THIS THEY'RE GONNA GO TO SOME MEMBER FONG YEAH I JUST I REALLY PROBABLY A COMMENT OR NOW. MORE ANYTHING ELSE BUT I'D I WOULD YOU MISTER TO. WOULD BE. PUSHING LOW COUNTY HEALTH OFF. TO ENSURE TEACHER ARE KEPT IN THE- TO. SO WILL GIVE US. L. A. COUNTY OR LOOKS THEY'RE GOING JUMP OVER TEACHERS. AND MAYBE PUSH SOME OF THEM OF ONE B. ONE. AND VERY PROBLEM THAT'S GOING TO HINDER ABILITY TO GET SCHOOLS RE OPEN. HER CHILDREN. CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE. SO I HOPE THAT YOU WOULD TAKE A ROLE IN THAT I KNOW I BEEN PUSHING ON THE L. A. COUNTY- HELTER. FOR I THIS VERY ISSUE. BECAUSE IT APPEARS SHE'S GOING TO PUSH TEACHERS. FROM THE ONE THE ONE SCHEDULE THAT. IS TO BE DISASTROUS IS GOING TO. VERY MUCH HAMPER OUR EFFORTS FOR SCHOOLS THAT'S IT THAT'S POSSIBLE TO HAVE ACROSS STATE IS WELL. SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE YOU'RE AWARE THAT NUMBER I HOPE YOU WOULD PUT ON- LOCAL DIRECTORS OF HEALTH. ACROSS THE STATE TO ENSURE THE DO NOT. DO THAT THANK YOU. CIRCLE BACK WITH YOU SENATE. OF THE NEST. AS YOU WE'VE ALWAYS SAID TEACHERS HAVE BE AT THE FRONT THE LINE ORDER FOR US HAVE IT YOU TO GET OUR OKAY. YOU KNOW AND COUNT WERE SEEN THAT EDUCATE ARE RECEIVED THE BACKS IT SHOULD IT'S. I THINK IT WAS A VERY GOOD MORNING THIS IS SUPERINTENDENT- JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON- WHAT MR DONALD I JUST MENTIONED- IN TERMS OF THE EDUCATORS AND THE CLARITY OF THE ELIGIBILITY FOR VACCINATIONS- WHAT ROLE DO YOU HAVE IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS KIND OF A UNIFORM STANDARD I THINK THE GOVERNOR OUTLINED YESTERDAY IN HIS PRESS CONFERENCE THAT. IT WOULD BE ONE A SIXTY FIVE AND UP AND THEN ONCE THAT WAS COMPLETED THEN IT WOULD BE EDUCATORS AND ONE B. IS THAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING OR- THE BABY FROM PLANTS PROVIDE SOME CLARITY FOR US. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING ASSEMBLYMEMBER FONG IT'S ALSO MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE GOVERNOR MADE ANNOUNCEMENTS THIS WEEK THAT WOULD AGAIN- PUT TEACHERS IN PLACE TO BE ACCELERATED IN THE PRIORITY- ROTATION FOR WHEN. BACK SCENES CAN. BE PROVIDED FOR THEM IN SOME COUNTIES THAT IS ALREADY THE CASE. BUT THAT IS REALLY DICTATED BY MY AND MY UNDERSTANDING THAT'S DICTATED BY. THE AVAILABILITY OF SUPPLY AND OF SOME HAVE SAID NO- WHO ARE ELIGIBLE AND THEN COUNTIES CAN USE IT. EITHER FOR THOSE WHO ARE SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER OR FOR OTHER PRIORITY GROUPS AND THAT THAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING. IN SOME COUNTIES AND SO THE GOVERNOR'S. ANNOUNCEMENT THIS WEEK AGAIN PUSH TEACHERS UP EVEN FURTHER. IN THE PRIORITY A LINE. AND IF ANYONE HAS ANY EXAMPLES OF PLACES. WHERE TEACHERS AREN'T BEING SUPPORTED IN GETTING ACCESS TO THE VACCINE WE LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU. TO RESOLVE THOSE ISSUES- I THOUGHT I THAT CINEMA BECAUSE I CERTAINLY MISTER ON A AND JUST THAT WE NEED TO GET A RATES- ACCESS THE BACK. AND ONE LAST I MAYBE ON A GOOD. JUMPING TO A TO TOPIC A TERMS OF- THE DEFINITION OF WHAT AND ALL. SCHOOL IS IT SEEMS THAT- AT IT APPEARS ARE SOME. INCONSISTENCIES AND IN TERMS OF THE APPLICATION THE GUIDANCE OF SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE. WERE FOLLOWING THE GUIDANCE BY CDPH TO MOVE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS BACK TO CAMPUS- YOU KNOW THE- YEAH STUDENTS THAT WERE HOMELESS FOSTER CHILDREN- THE END OF THE CHILDREN OF OUR SYSTEM. THAT DOES A SPECIAL NEEDS BUT THEN IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A NEW DEFINITION THAT'S COMING UP WHERE A REAL OPEN SCHOOL IS HAS TO BE A FULL CLASS ACROSS ALL STUDENTS OF CAN YOU PROVIDE SOME CLARITY IN TERMS OF. WHAT IS IT WHAT WOULD BE THE DEFINITION OF AN OPEN SCHOOL- FOR ELIGIBILITY OF WHATEVER THE LEGISLATURE ACTS ON. FONG I KNOW THAT THIS- RELATES TO GUIDANCE THAT WAS PROVIDED MAYBE TWO WEEKS AGO. BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THAT INADVERTENTLY- BLOXHAM EFFORTS OF SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS. OPEN MORE SCHOOLS THAT ESSENTIALLY SAID THAT- IF YOU ALREADY OPEN YOU CAN STAY OPEN BUT IF YOU WERE NOT OPEN AND YOU COULDN'T MEET CERTAIN CONDITIONS THAT YOU WOULDN'T OPEN WE HELD A MEETING IN. MY OFFICE ALL THE MEETING WITH A FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND-DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH IN THIS CAME UP AS  TOP CONCERN- I CAN TELL YOU THAT I KNOW THAT- THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH. ARE WORKING FOR WAYS TO ADJUST THAT THEY DON'T WANT THERE TO BE ANY BARRIER TO SCHOOL BEING ABLE TO OPEN I BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO KEEP- CLARITY AROUND KEEPING SMALL COHORTS IN KEEPING PEOPLE SAFE. AND THEY ARE AWARE OF THIS CONCERN AND- WE BROUGHT TO THEIR ATTENTION DIRECTLY. BECAUSE WE'VE HEARD IT FROM MY COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS IN I BELIEVE. THAT THEY'RE WORKING TO SOLVE IT. I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT THAT'S A- THAT THAT'S ONLY WELCOME NEWS I A LOT OF- SCHOOL THIS AT LEAST AND IN IN MY COUNTY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. WE'RE TRYIG TO FOLLOW THE GUIDANCE AND NOW- ARE. WOULD BE PUNISHED IF IT WAS A NEW DEFINITION SO I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOU LOOK INTO THIS MATTER. THANK YOU. SIMON FONG AND WE TALKED OFTEN THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC THANK YOU FOR YOUR ADVOCACY FOR YOUR SCHOOLS IN YOUR FAMILIES. IF THERE ARE SPECIFIC DISTRICTS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED IN THIS WAY PLEASE LET'S. SHARE THAT WITH ME WE'RE HAPPY TO. RAISE THAT CAN LIFT IT UP THE MORE EXAMPLES WE HAVE AND THE MORE CONTEXT WE HAVE. I THINK THE BETTER THAT THAT ADJUSTMENTS TO THE GUIDANCE CAN BE MADE. SO AS YOU SAY THERE WON'T BE ANY BARRIERS TO THEIR OPENING. I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT NOW TAKE YOU UP ON THE OFFER THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER MEDINA. YEAH I JUST GOT INTO THE CONVERSATION HERE- JUST. SOME EXPERIENCE FROM MY DISTRICT- MY HOME SCHOOL DISTRICT IS STILL CLOSED- YOU KNOW- IT'S COMPLETELY ON DISTANCE LEARNING- BUT I HAVE MANY PUBLIC SCHOOLS ACTUALLY THAT HAVE OPENED IN THE DISTRICT- AND HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO SO SAFELY AND- AND- THERE'S BEEN VERY LIMITED. CASES- A MARKS SCHOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN OPEN THEY'VE BEEN OPEN VERY SUCCESSFULLY EVEN WITHOUT A ROBUST CADENCE I MEAN I DON'T I GUESS WE NEED TO DEFINE WHAT THAT TERM IS- BUT AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY. STATED THERE IS TESTING AVAILABLE AND SCHOOLS ARE TESTING- YOU KNOW IT AS PART OF THEIR PROGRAM WHAT THEY CAN DO AND WHAT'S FEASIBLE- AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT YOUR VERY SUCCESSFULLY THUS FAR- I'M REALLY AWARE OF ONLY ONE. OUTBREAK AT A LOCAL SCHOOL IT DID NOT BECOME SOME KIND OF LARGE SPREADING EVENT IT WAS CONTAINED IN THE AND THEY YOU KNOW. WERE ABLE TO GET THE KIDS BACK INTO SCHOOL WITHOUT WITHOUT ANY ISSUES SO I THINK TO SOME EXTENT YOU KNOW THE YES WE'D HAVE TESTING BUT IT'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS FEASIBLE FOR THE SCHOOL TO BE ABLE TO DO- I HEAR A LOT OF IF IT'S A WEEKLY TESTING REQUIREMENT THERE'S MANY SCHOOLS ARE JUST NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT- FEASIBLY- SO I MEAN NOTE I THINK WE JUST NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT WHAT HAS BEEN THE EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW HOW. HAVE WE BEEN ABLE TO DO THIS SAFELY ALREADY I THINK THE ANSWER IS ACTUALLY YES- AS FAR AS VACCINES AND HAS BEEN POINTED OUT THERE IS A DISPARITY RIGHT NOW SOME SCHOOLS SOME COUNTIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MOVE FOR WITH VACCINES- SCHOOL STAFF AND TEACHERS. WHEREAS OTHERS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO AND JUST TO SHED A LITTLE BIT MORE LIGHT ON THIS BECAUSE THIS NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT TO LIGHT. IS TEACHERS AND EDUCATION. STAFF WERE ALWAYS IN ONE B. I SINCE THIS. VACCINATION ROLLOUT WAS ESTABLISHED THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ONE B. THAT HAS NOT CHANGE WHAT CHANGE WAS LAST WEEK THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WAS TELLING LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS. THAT THEY NEEDED TO DO SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER FIRST AS A PRIORITY BEFORE YOU MOVED INTO ONE B. AND THEY WERE IN FACT SAYING THAT AND SO PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS STARTED TELLING EDUCATORS. AND EDUCATION STAFF AND TEACHERS THAT HEY WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO VACCINATE TO. UNTIL WE DO SIXTY FIVE PLUS THAT'S A FACT. AND THEN YESTERDAY THE GOVERNOR REVERSE COURSE AND STARTED SAYING NO THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT TRUE- YOU CAN DO THEM BOTH AT THE SAME TIME- BUT HIS PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT WAS TELLING. PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS LAST WEEK THEY COULD NOT DO THAT. THAT HAD THE EFFECT OF DELAYING IT AND NOW SOME PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS. ARE STICKING TO THAT POLICY AND SAYING THEY WILL NOT MOVE INT ONE B. UNTIL THEY HAVE COMPLETED THE SIXTY FIVE PLUS. CATEGORY AND THAT GOES TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL'S POINT WHICH IS WE NEED TO BE PUSHING OUR- PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS SAY HEY YOU CAN DO BOTH GROUPS. AND THAT WE SHOULD ACTUALLY MAKE EDUCATION A PRIORITY. AS THESE ARE FRONT LINE WORKERS EDUCATION IS ESSENTIAL. AND THEY SHOULD BE PART OF THAT SO. THESE ARE THE KIND OF ISSUES THAT WERE HAVING TO WORK THROUGH YOU KNOW AGAIN IT'S A KIND OF A MIXED MESSAGE COMING OUT OF THE ADMINISTRATION- AND NOW THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME COUNTIES. BEING ABLE TO VACCINATE THEIR IS- SCHOOL STAFF. WHILE OTHERS ARE NOT ABLE TO AND THAT'S GOING TO CREATE A FURTHER DISPARITY IN EDUCATION. BECAUSE THOSE THOSE COUNTIES WILL BE ABLE TO MOVE FOR WITH IN PERSON EDUCATION WHILE OTHERS. MAY BE FURTHER DELAYED AND THAT TO ME THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO. REALLY ADDRESS. VERY QUICKLY AND IMMEDIATELY. THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER GO I'M SURE THAT THE REPRESENTATIVES FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WILL WANT TO AMPLIFY. THAT WHEN IT COMES TO THE VACCINE I THINK THE DISPARITY HAS TO DO WITH EACH COUNTY. HAS RECEIVED A DOSE IS DIRECTLY- FROM THE FEDERAL FROM THE CC IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOT FROM THE STATE EACH COUNTY. HAS MADE DECISIONS ABOUT HOW TO USE SURPLUS IF THEY HAVE INDIVIDUALS INCLUDING HEALTHCARE WORKERS WHO FOR WHATEVER REASON CHOOSE NOT TO USE THE VACCINE AND SO THE GOVERNOR HAS PROVIDED FLEXIBILITY- TO. AND ALLOW EDUCATORS TO RECEIVE THAT VACCINE IT HAS ALSO ALLOWED FLEXIBILITY TO PROVIDE THOSE WERE SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER TO GET THE VACCINE S. AS THEY SHOULD GIVEN THAT THOSE WERE SOME OF THE HIGHEST CASES OF COINFECTION- TAKE PLACE- IN IN MOST SERIOUS CONDITIONS. AND SO WE AGREE WITH YOU WE MUST PRIORITIZE EDUCATORS THEY ARE AT THE FRONT OF THE LINE THERE AND THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN ONE B. AS YOU SAID- BUT EVERY COUNTY HAS. ITS OWN WAY OF DISSEMINATING THE VACCINE AND THEN A GUY SAYS CHANGE IN SO THERE ARE THOSE WHO NEED SOME HELP UNDERSTANDING THAT EDUCATORS STILL ARE- AT THE TOP OF THE LINE FOR AVAILABLE DOSES WE ARE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU. AND OTHERS IN THIS BODY- TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE AWARE OF THAT. THANK YOU OUT LET'S MOVE ON BECAUSE I KNOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE GOVERNOR'S TEAM WE CAN ENGAGE THEM ON THIS ON THIS TOPIC AS WELL- SO WITH THAT THANK YOU SUPERINTENDENT AND WE'LL SEE YOU SOON HOPEFULLY IN PERSON- AND IN THE FUTURE HOLD ON. ME YES MR GONNA START. THANK YOU- MISTER SUPER AND- AS A FORMER TEACHER. AND FORMER SCHOOL BOARD- VERY MUCH WANT TO SEE YOU KNOW SCHOOLS GO BACK. IN PERSON. BUT MY QUESTION TO YOU IS. WHERE DOES THE ULTIMATE AUTHORITY. TO MAKE THE DECISIONS FOR STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE FOR SCHOOLS TO REOPEN. ALLY WHO WILL MAKE THAT DECISION WHO HAS THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE THAT DECISION. THANK YOU SOME REMEMBER DINA YOU KNOW AS A FORMER SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER- I'M A FORMER SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER THAT ALTERNATELY THE AUTHORITY FOR OPENING DECISIONS SLICE WITH THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT WE HAVE OVER ONE THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS EACH WITH THEIR OWN SCHOOL BOARD WHICH IS THEIR OVERNING BODY TO MAKE THEIR DECISIONS. NOTHING ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE STATE HAS TAKEN AWAY THE DECISION MAKING OF LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS. EVERY LEVEL OUR OFFICE THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH WE TRY TO PROVIDE RESOURCES AND GUIDANCE TO HELP GUIDE THAT. LIKE THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE TO HELP DISTRIBUTE THE P. P. ACROSS. OUR STATE WE WORKED WORTH FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS TO HELP THEM DISSEMINATE THAT BUT WE WILL TELL THEM HOW TO DISSEMINATE THAT. WE DON'T TELL THEM WHEN THEY OPEN- AND SO AGAIN THAT POWER ALWAYS HAS RESTED WITH THE LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS- TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS- BUT OUR OFFICE THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE DEPARTMENT FINANCE DOES EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN. LET RESOURCES AND GUIDANCE AND SUPPORT TO HELP THEM IN MAKING THOSE DECISIONS. THANK YOU FOR. THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU NOW LET'S MOVE ON AND WE'LL GET TO OUR OUR FIRST- PRESENTATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WE HAVE I THINK WE SAW JESSICA HOLMES SHE HAD TO RUN WITH THE GOVERNOR AND IT AT A MEETING IF NOT WE'LL HAVE SOMEBODY ELSE FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE STEP IN. THAT CORRECT. CORRECT I'M GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JUST GO HOME DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I WON'T GO TOO DEEPLY INTO DETAIL ON OUR PROPOSAL AROUND- IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AS IT YOU KNOW IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT YOU'LL HAVE AN EXCELLENT UNDERSTANDING OF IT- BUT JUST TO REITERATE AND THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT INCLUDED SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS MORE THAN SIX POINT SEVEN BILLION TO ENABLE QUICK TO MITIGATE CODED NINETEEN PANDEMIC IMPACTS. ON STUDENTS AND STAFF AND PROVIDED SCHOOLS WITH GUIDANCE AND RESOURCES- TO MAXIMIZE STATE AND PERSONAL SERVICES TO STUDENTS. HOWEVER AT THE PANDEMIC PROGRESSES IN AT THE SCIENCE CENTER STANDING UP CODE NINETEEN INCREASES- WE UNDERSTAND IT MUST BE ADAPTABLE TO OUR CIRCUMSTANCES AND GIVEN OPPORTUNITIES TO STEM THE IMPACT. OF THE PANDEMIC ON OUR CHILDREN. AND TO THAT END THE IN. IS AT THE IT POPPED SAFETY GUY FOR PERSON. AND RECOGNITION THAT MASKING SOCIAL DISTANCING CO COURTING. AND OTHER KEY MEASURES ARE EXCELLENT SAFEGUARDS TO MINIMIZE VIRUS SPREAD AND CAN OFFER PATHWAYS TO SCHOOLREOPENING EVEN IN COMMUNITIES WHERE RATES OF COMMUNITY SPREAD ARE HIGH- WE ARE. IMPROVING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT SCHOOLS. IN PUTTING HEALTH SAFEGUARDS INTO PLACE. MAKING IT EASIER FOR EDUCATION MINISTRY URGED TO GET ONE ON ONE GUIDANCE FROM PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS. AN ACCESS CODE IN NINETEEN TESTING. AND MAKING IT EASIER FOR SCHOOL STAFF AND COMMUNITY TO OLDER PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS BUT HEALTH CONDITIONS AT SCHOOL CONCERNED THEM- WE KNOW THAT FURTHER FORWARD PROGRESS REQUIRES ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND TO THAT END THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO BILLION FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION GRANT. ANY GRANTS ARE INTENDED TO BUILD ON THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT INVESTMENTS AS WELL AS SIX BILLION IN FEDERAL ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL EMERGENCY RELIEF FUNDS THAT WILL SOON BE MADE AVAILABLE TO SCHOOLS. THE GRANT FROM TWENTY FIVE AND FUND TAKE THE OPENING FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN IN THE STATE INCLUDING CHILDREN EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE SINCE DISABILITIES IN THE STATE'S YOUNGEST LEARNERS. BRICOLAGE OCCASIONAL AGENCIES ARE ELEAZAR RELATIVELY LOW COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION RATE THAT PLANS IN PLACE FOR STATE THINKFREE OPENING WE'LL GET RISKY PROPORTIONALLY. LARGER GRANT NOW. UNDER THIRTEEN PLANNING TIME TO STILL APPLY AND RECEIVE FUNDING AS NO LOWER BUT SIGNIFICANT RATE. ALIANT AT HIGHER TREND RATE ALSO FOR GRAN ON EITHER. AND RECEIVED GRANTS AND BUT ARE NOT REQUIRED REOPEN INCREASED INSTRUCTION UNTIL COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION RATES DECLINE. I'M I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE- OBVIOUSLY MR THURMAN- WHO HAS DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB IN IN DESCRIBING AND THEN AFTER A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU. YOU POSED TO HIM AND JUST WANT TO THANK HIM FOR ON THE EXCELLENT WORKING THE STOCK FOR DEALING TO SUPPORT- YES SHOULDN'T GETTING BACK INTO SCHOOL AND AN IMPROVING DISTANCE LEARNING- ED THAT'S HAPPENING FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T COME BACK. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. YES I. SO DO YOU HAVE TO LEAVE MISS HOLMES- PLEASE STAND BY TEN THIRTY. YEAH OKAY GOOD SO- I KNOW WE TALKED A LOT WITH MR THURMAN ABOUT THIS BUT YOU OF COURSE HAVE THE GOVERNOR'S VOICE HERE. AND THIS IS OUR FIRST TIME THAT TALKING ABOUT THIS BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS OUR OUR COUNTERPARTS IN THE SENATE. HAD A ROBUST HEARING LAST WEEK AND DOG REALLY INTO THIS ISSUE AND THERE WAS SOME INDICATION THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE. A REVISED- PLAN WITH THIS TWO BILLION TO ADDRESS. SOME OF THE IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES SOME OF THE SCHOOL CONCERNS AND OF COURSE WILL BE VOTING ON THAT IN THE FULL BUDGET COMMITTEE. SOON BUT YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE A CHIP I WAS A TEST OF THAT SO DO YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO. EXPAND ON WHAT ELEMENTS YOU'RE LOOKING AT TWEAKING WITH THAT PLOT PROPOSAL. ABSOLUTELY AMBER SPEAKING WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH AND BOTH YOUR STAFF AND STAFF FROM THE SENATE. I'M TO ADDRESS CONCERNS AROUND- TIMELINE OBVIOUSLY THE FEBRUARY FIRST TIME LINE IS COMING UP VERY QUICKLY HERE SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT THAT. MAY NEED TO BE ADDRESSED- AS WELL AS CONCERNS ABOUT THE FEASIBILITY- AROUND THAT CASTING CADENCES- ALTHOUGH ALSO RECOGNIZING THAT WE NEED TO HAVE THAT MINIMUM CASTING IN THERE TO ENSURE HEALTH AND SAFETY- AND THEN. ADDITIONAL CONCERNS RUN IMPLEMENTATION- AND HOW THAT COULD BE IMPACTING SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT HAVE ALREADY. OPENED AND WHO HAVE SHOWN A TRACK RECORD OF- YOU KNOW TRANSMISSION SO AND YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE- WE'VE HEARD FROM MANY MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS- AS WELL AS CHARTER SCHOOLS. YEAH VEGETATION AND THEN AS WELL THE CONCERN OF MEMBERS AND WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO WORK HARD WITH YOUR STAFF TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE. THE WORKABLE- SOLUTION THAT REALLY PRIORITIZE BRING. CAN ACT IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. YEAH AND I DO OPEN RIGHT HERE WE'RE HEAR FROM LA- BUT- MAYBE YOU CAN JUST READ RISK. YOU KNOW YOU LOOK LOOK AT. DOT BALL AT THE NAY THAT PROPOSED AND- TO IN PER INSTRUCTION SO HOW DO YOU ADDRESS WHAT THE L. A. O. HAS BROUGHT UP. GIVEN THE LACK OF A DETAIL ON THAT IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT TO RESPOND TO HOWEVER- I WOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW IN THE CONVERSATION THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING WITH DOZENS UPON DOZENS OF ELEAZAR- WE'RE WE'RE DEFINITELY MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE BETTER UNDERSTANDING THEIR SPECIFIC BARRIERS AND CHALLENGES. SO THAT WE CAN TWEAK OUR PROPOSAL TO MAKE SURE THAT IT ALIGNS- TO WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE- AND- YOU KNOW I WOULD JUST POINT TO THE FACT THAT ALTHOUGH MANY MANY FOLKS HAS HAS QUESTIONED WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET. OF OUR PROPOSAL ARE FEASIBLE. THERE ARE AT LEAST IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHO ARE DOING THE THINGS THAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING NOW AND REALLY WHAT WE HAVE IN OUR GUIDANCE OUR- BEST PRACTICES THAT THAT'S FINE AND THAT FOLKS WHO ARE HAVE BEEN IN THE FIELD DOING THIS WORK. AND SHOWING THAT IT WORKS AND HOW TO HAS HAS PUT FORTH AN IMPALA SO. I DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE THAT THAT IT'S UNLIKELY TO RESULT INQUIRY OPENING OBVIOUSLY RECOGNIZE THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME CHANGES. ON SOME OF THE DETAILS OF THE PLAN TO MAKE IT MORE FEASIBLE- BUT WE BELIEVE THAT IF BOTH CAN AND WILL RESULT IN INCREASING FOCUS SAFETY OF IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. AVAILABILITY IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. YEAH AND THEN. THIS IS THE VACCINES AS I SAID EARLIER ARE OUT OF OUR CONTROL BASED UPON WHAT WE'RE GETTING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN THE MANUFACTURERS BUT ONE THING. I THINK WE COULD ADDRESSES THAT IS THE TESTING. AND I'VE HEARD FROM LOCAL AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER SCHOOLS HERE IN SACRAMENTO PRIVATE SCHOOLS AND HOW MUCH THEY ARE SPENDING ON TESTING BUT MONEY IS NOT THE PROBLEM WE HAVE. INFUSION OF ONE TIME I IN THIS BUDGET FOR REVENUES COMING IN THE FIRST FEDERAL PACKAGE THE SECOND ONE. SO WHAT COULD WE DO TO NOT LESSER AND I USED TO PROVIDE CASH OR THE PROMISE TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS RIGHT NOW I MEAN. LAST YEAR OF THE DIESS WE HAVE TO BUY. OR NOT WE HAVE TO BUY BUT THEY HAD TO BUY THESE TESTS THAT WE. TAKE THE INSTANT TEST WHATEVER THERE ARE THINK THEY'RE THIRTY BUCKS A TE WOULD HAVE YOU- BUT- WHY WE HAVE ENOUGH MONEY IT'S- AND- MORE COMING IN. TO JUST FRONT AND ALLOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO PURCHASE THESE. IS THAT AT ALL IN THIS SCENARIO BECAUSE IT WOULD BE A SHAME. TO GET THE FEDERAL MONEY IN A FEW WEEKS WE'RE HERE IN MARCH BUT- WE FINALLY HAVE THE MONEY FEDERAL MONEY WE'RE GONNA PUT OUT TO DISTRICTS IN MAY AND THEN THE SCHOOL YEAR IS OVER. SO YOU KNOW WHAT CAN WE DO TO ADDRESS THIS NOW. THAT'S A GREAT POINT AND- I'M JUST IT JUST CAN'T BUILD ON WHAT YOU YOU SAID MR MCCARTY AND- WE DO HAS. AT LEAST WE HAD AT APPROVED BOTH THE ADMINISTRATION LEGISLATURE HAVE APPROVED- THE ALLOCATION AT SIX BILLION OF THE SIX POINT SEVEN BILLION ALLOCATED TASK GROUPS. ON THE SECONDS. THAT CARED BACK. I THINK IT'S THE C. R. R. ESSAY. ON THE FEDERAL RELIEF BILL THAT JUST CAME OUT- AND THAT WE HAD JUST SENT THAT. OVER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SO THEY CAN GET STARTED. ON ALLOCATING THOSE FUNDS DIRECTLY TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS OF THE FUND SHOULD BE COMING RIGHT AWAY- I THINK IN TERMS OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING THAT'S WHERE YOU ALSO SEE SPENT. ON URGENCY AROUND THIS TWO BILLION PROPOSAL TO INFUSE MORE FUNDS INTO THE SYSTEM- BUT IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL PATENT FILED. IT'S INTERESTING I THINK THE INITIAL REACTION OF MANY FOLKS- FROM ELEAZAR COULD NOT PARTICIPATED IN TESTING YET- AND ACTUALLY THERE ARE QUITE A FEW THAT HAPPENING. YOU KNOW WE TALKED TO THE SEVEN LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND- YOU KNOW A LOT OF THEM SAID YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE GOT TESTING PROGRAMS IN PLACE ALREADY- SO A LOT OF. A LOT OF AT LEAST HAVE BEEN PARTICIPATING- BUT IT FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T BEEN IT SEEMS VERY OVERWHELMING HOWEVER WHEN WE HAD INDIVIDUAL CONVERSATIONS WITH THOSE ELEAZAR. AND WALK THEM THROUGH THE PROCESS AS A WORKING WITH THE VALENCIA LAB- IT BECOMES VERY CLEAR VERY QUICKLY THAT IT'S ACTUALLY MUCH MORE DOABLE- BUT A LOT OF. A LOT OF AT LEAST THINK IT IS THAT WE REALLY RECOMMEND AND ENCOURAGE FOLKS. TO REACH OUT THROUGH OUR SAFE SCHOOLS. AND WEBSITE- AND- AN AFTER QUESTIONS AND GET CONNECT UP WITH THE- JULY BECAUSE- AND IT'S REALLY BEEN SO UP TO BE. SCHOOL THIS. AND TRY SCHOOLS- CAN REALLY PROVE ACTUAL OPTIONS. FOR WHO NEED TO GET STARTED ON THEIR TESTING. NOW OKAY THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER REST. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. WE KNOW THAT THE JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL ASSUMES IN PERSON LEARNING FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SCHOOL YEAR AND IT DOESN'T INCLUDE ANY EXTENSIONS. OF WHAT IS CURRENTLY IN THE DISTANCE LEARNING EDUCATION CODE WHICH IS SET TO EXPIRE IN JULY. WHAT HAPPENS IF WE NEED TO CONTINUE WITH DISTANCE LEARNING IN THE FALL BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WHAT ARE. OUR CONTINGENCY PLANS AND HOW WILL THE ADMINISTRATION ENGAGE WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO DEVELOP A FRAMEWORK OF ACTION FOR THIS SCENARIO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THE PHONE NUMBER IS FOR THAT QUESTION AND IT'S AN EXCELLENT ONE WE'VE ALREADY HEARD FROM ELEAZAR WHO HAVE BEEN- TALKING TO THEIR FAMILIES ABOUT OPTIONS FOR SCHOOL IN THE FALL AND THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN THAT- THERE WON'T IT WON'T BE AMONG FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES THAT IT WON'T BE SAFE TO RETURNED IN PERSON INSTRUCTION OF PAUL AND I THINK OUR RESPONSES IS TWO FOLD. THE WINE- YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND WE- NEED TO HAVE A CONTINGENCY PLAN IN PLACE FOR THE FALL- AND YOU KNOW. WE'RE WE'RE WORKING ON GETTING STUDENTS BACK AS EARLY AS WE CAN NOW THAT WE INTEND TO START HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH I'M LEGISLATIVE STAFF MEMBERS HAD COMMUNITY GROUPS ELEAZAR- IN IN THE COMING WEEKS VERY SOON CARE- BUT THE SECOND PIECE IS. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WERE HELPING COMMUNITIES UNDERSTAND THAT TO BE A SAFETY PROTOCOLS I THINK THE GUIDANCE THAT WE HAVE- RECENTLY PUT OUT WILL KEEP FAMILIES AND TEACHERS STATE. FARM IN THE CLASSROOMS FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AND CAN'T AND CAN BE DONE IN A SAFE MANNER AND I THINK THAT. THAT BUILDING THAT TRUST AND IS A REALLY KEY PIECE- SO HOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD AT THE STATE- IN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM BUT I THINK BOTH OF YOUR YOUR POINT SIR ARE ARE WELL TAKEN AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO WORK ON AND. WE HAVE PLANS TO DO SO IN THE COMING WEEKS. THANK YOU WE HAVE ASSEMBLY FOR. GAL AND THEN- DON- I THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR THANK YOU SO TOPPING UP. I GUESS- IN MY QUESTION IS THE WHAT THE SAME QUESTION I POSED- TO SUPERJET THURMAN WHICH IS THIS. REDEFINITION OF THE INCONSISTENCIES IN WHAT IS- WHAT IS DEFINED AS A RE OPENED SCHOOL WHETHER THE SCHOOL NEEDS TO SERVE THE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS OR WHETHER A SCHOOL- HAS TO RE OPEN A FULL CLASS SIZE ACROSS ALL STUDENTS HAD TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES COULD YOU PROVIDE SOME CLARITY OF FROM FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE- REPEATING THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF WHAT. IS OCCURRING WHAT IS THE GOVERNOR'S PERSPECTIVE IS ON THAT AND HOW WE MOVE FORWARD. CERTAINLY SO I THINK WHAT YOU WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO IS THAT THE CURRENT PROPOSAL CURRENT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WE'VE PUT OUT- SAID THAT IN ORDER TO RECEIVE FUNDS YOU MUST BE OPENED BY A CERTAIN DATE. I MEAN YOU MUST RE OPEN Q. AND PACIFIED YOU KNOW VULNERABLE GROUPS AS WELL AS- CAPE GROUP FIVE OR SIX DEPENDING ON WHERE YOUR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL GRADES AND- AND- AND SO THAT'S THE CURRENT PROPOSAL WE HAVE HEARD FROM A LOT OF- ELEAZAR ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT HAVE ALREADY OPENED OR ALREADY HAD PLANS IN PLACE. FOR A TIERED REOPENING ON THIRTIETH SOME DISTRICTS MAY HAS- PLAN THAT BY FEBRUARY FIRST. AND THEY'RE GOING TO HAS YET SHE CAME IN FIRST GRADE IN PLACE AND THEN. YOU KNOW BY BY APRIL THEY'LL HAVE YOU KNOW GRADES TWO THREE FOUR AND FIVE INCH SO IT'S NOT EXACTLY THE SAME AS AS THE PLAN THAT. WE PUT OUT AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH A LOT OF EARLY AGE. TRYING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND- WHAT THE INDIVIDUAL SITUATIONS ARE CERTAINLY NOT OUR INTENT. TO CLOSE SCHOOLS MORE- OBVIOUSLY UNLESS THERE'S YOU KNOW AN OUTBREAK OR OR STURGEON INFECTIONS- AND SO IT BUT IT DIFFICULT RIGHT. ACROSS AN ENTIRE STATE WITH MORE THAN A THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO CREATE A SINGLE POLICY- THAT ADDRESSES EVERY POTENTIAL- SITUATION SO WE'RE WE'RE WORKING RIGHT NOW WE'RE TALKING WITH. AND STAFF FROM BOTH HOUSES AND AS WELL AS ELLIE EIGHT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT THE NEEDS ARE SO THAT WE CAN- PUT OUT A POLICY THAT MAKES SENSE FOR EVERYONE AND ENSURES YOU KNOW KIDS CAN STILL REMAIN IN SCHOOL AND IT'S SAFE- ENCIRCLED. SIXTEEN FORD WITH THIRTEEN THE CLAIMS AT THE HOUSE SURE. I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT AND I WOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE OF COURSE- TO ALLOW SOME FLEXIBILITY AND OF COURSE ALLOW LOCALS TO DICTATE THOSE DECISIONS SO I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE- YOU ARE A RESPONSE. AND LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU. THANK YOU SOME MEMBER GALA. YEAH AN IMMEDIATE I THAT THAT THE KINDA AVOIDED WHICH IS- LAST YEAR YOU GOT. YOUR PROJECT ON. WERE OFF AND THAT WAS THE BASIS FOR DOING DEFERRALS. WHY ARE WE NOT- PAIN DOWN DEFERRALS WITH THEIR ONE TIME MONEY RIGHT NOW THAT SCHOOLS NEED RIGHT NOW. YEAH THAT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION AND ONE OF YOU'VE GOTTEN SEVERAL TIMES ALREADY THANK YOU NUMBER ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER AND SO THERE'S A COUPLE OF ISSUES AROUND DIFFER ALSO WON THE FIRST PIECES- WE HAVE NOT FINALIZED REVENUES FOR IT BUT THE CURRENT YEAR AND THE BUDGET YEAR- THERE'S STILL QUITE A BIT AS- A FLEXIBILITY IN THE AFFECTED BY POSSIBLY. THERE COULD STILL BE QUITE A BIT OF VOLATILITY IN THOSE AND WE'RE NOT A 100% LOCKED DOWN ON WHAT THAT COULD BE I'M LOOKING FORWARD SO IT YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A PROPOSAL AND THAT WE JUST DON'T KNOW AT WHAT OUR FINAL REVENUES ARE GOING TO BE. STEP ONE PIECES THE UNCERTAINTY THE SECOND PIECE IS THAT AND FOR THOSE ELEAZAR WHO HAS- GONE OUT FOR TRANS WHICH ARE SHORT TERM CASH LOAN AND THAT THEY OFTEN. TAKE ON DURING THAT TIME THE DEFERRAL- IT EAT EARLY PAYOFF COULD RESULT IN PENALTIES- AND OR TAX IMPLICATIONS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND I WOULD HAVE TO DEFER FOR SPECIFICS. ON CUE SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAVE MORE INFORMATION AROUND THAT BUT ESSENTIALLY- ELLIE A IS NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE OUT A TREND THAT IS BEYOND WHAT- IT'S ACTUAL NEED IS SO IT COULD CREATE COMPLICATIONS IN THE FIELD TO THE EXTENT THAT WE- TRY TO PAY OFF- DEFERRALS. BEFORE WE ACTUALLY DEFERRED THEN. AND SO. THAT'S ANOTHER P. AND THEN THE FINAL P. ISSUES AROUND CASH DEPENDS FOR THIS- THAT CASH FLOW WITH SOME. THAT YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT AND NATURE THAT WE CAN DO IN OUR SPA. WAY SO THERE ARE OTHER COMPLICATIONS AROUND THAT AND THAT YOU KNOW AT THIS POINT IN TIME WHERE WE ARE IN THIS WHOLE PROCESS- IT DOES NOT SEEM WIDE. TO PAY THOSE OFF EARLY. OKAY WELL WITH A FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLAR WINDFALL AND SIX BILLION COMING IN FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I THINK WE CAN MAKE OUR SCHOOLS HOLE ON TO PAYMENTS I'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT I'LL GO INTO A- YEAH YOU WANT TO MORE SPECIFICS I THINK WHY THE L. A. O. IS SAYING THAT YOUR RE OPENING PLAN AN INCENTIVE GRANT IS ON WORKABLE. IS BECAUSE OF A FEW THINGS AND ALL THIS LIST SOME OF THEM ONE IS YOU HAVE A FEBRUARY ONE FILE DATE WE HAVEN'T EVEN COMPLETED THIS EARLY ACTION ITEM SO HOW ARE THEY GONNA APPLY FOR MONEY NEXT WEEK. AND THEN THEY HAVE TO BE OPEN BY MID. FEBRUARY YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S GOT A BLUEPRINT IN PLACE THAT SAYS IF YOU DIDN'T REOPEN YOUR SCHOOL IN THE FALL YOU CAN'T REOPEN UNTIL YOU GET OUT OF PURPLE TEAR. UNLIKELY THAT MANY OF THESE COUNTIES ARE GOING TO BE IN RED DEER BY THAT TIME HOW ARE THEY GOING TO RE OPEN- SO I MEAN THAT THAT'S ONE THING THAT'S KIND OF A MAJOR BLOCKADE- ANOTHER ONE. IS THE TESTING CADENCE MANY DISTRICTS AS YOU KNOW. I'VE BEEN SAYING THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO A WEEKLY TESTING CADENCE WHICH AS I UNDERSTAND IT WOULD BE- THE CADENCE REQUIRED TO GET INCENTIVE GRANT MONIES. ANOTHER BARRIER. FOR DISTRICTS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS MONEY- AND THEN YOU HAVE BEEN HERE A REQUIREMENT THAT. THE- TEACHERS LOCAL TEACHERS UNION HAS TO SUPPORT. OR APPROVE ACT. RE OPENING PLANNED FOR THAT SCHOOL I HAVE SCHOOLS THAT ARE GETTING CEASE AND DESIST LETTERS FROM THE DAY AS WE SPEAK- AND THERE YOU AND THEY'RE GOING TO USE THIS PROVISION ESSENTIALLY TO KEEP SCHOOL SHUT DOWN SO THERE'S SOME MAJOR. PROBLEMS WITH YOUR RE OPENING PRO AND I JUST GIVE YOU A FEW- HOW DO YOU GUYS INTEND TO ADDRESS THAT BECAUSE OTHERWISE I THINK YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET A LOT OF DISTRICTS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS INCENTIVE MONEY. CERTAINLY AND FIX IT TO TACKLE A BUT AT THE BEGINNING OF MY REMARKS. AND WE ARE AWARE THAT THEIR CONCERNS AROUND TIMELINE DETECTING CADENCES AND THEN CONCERNED ABOUT. SCHOOLS THAT ARE ALREADY OPEN- AND WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO ENSURE THAT KIDS ARE NOT YOU. WILL NOT CLOSE AND SHORT OF AND AT STURGEON FACTION. I'M FOR THE OTHER ISSUES THAT WE ARE DEFINITELY WORKING ON- AGAIN YOU KNOW OUR OUR ANTICIPATION WITH THAT- YEAH WE MIGHT HAVE IT AT A FASTER- MOVE ON THIS ITEM THAT HAD HAPPENED AND SO CERTAINLY NEED TO LOOK AT THAT FEBRUARY ONE DATE AS I MENTIONED. I'M THE ONE THING I DO I DO WANT TO JUST CLARIFY- ON DECLINING ISSUE IS THAT- THE LANGUAGE IN THE EVEN IN THE. CURRENT ITERATION OF THE TRAILER BILL. DEFIES THAT ELEAZAR ARE- YOU KNOW ABOUT TWENTY. TO EIGHT AND- IT'S IT WILL BE CHANGED FIVE. ABOUT THE I. TWENTY FIVE HER HUNTER THOUSAND- THAT AD THEY DON'T HAVE TO RE OPEN- BY THE DATE SPECIFIED THEY ONLY HAVE TO REOPEN LINDA THANK YOU DO YOU FELT WHEN THEY'RE WHEN THEY'RE- THERE COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION RATES DROP. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WAS CLEAR THAT WE'RE NOT HOLDING ANYONE WHO IS- IN A DEEP. PURPLE CONTUSION PEOPLE ARE CALLING IT COULD REALLY. AND TO REOPEN BEFORE IT IS SAFE TO DO. WE HAVE MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE OPEN RIGHT NOW IN PURPLE TEAR- THEY ALREADY RE OPEN IN THE FALL AND THEY STAYED OPEN AND THEY ARE NOT HAVING PROBLEMS SO. I GUESS I UNDERSTAND THAT I MEAN SHOULD THERE BE A CHANGE TO THE BLUEPRINT. FRAMEWORK I MEAN THE GOVERNOR CHANGES PLANNED OVERNIGHT LAST NIGHT- I'M SUPPOSING YOU COULD PROBABLY CHANGE THE BLUEPRINT TODAY TOO IF YOU WANTED TO. I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO IS A DEFINITE CHANGE IN THE FINE OVERNIGHT LAST NIGHT HOWEVER AND- I WOULD MENTION THAT MORE- THE REGIONAL STAY AT HOME WATER THAT HE LIFTED. NOT CONSISTENT WITH HIS PREVIOUS CRITERIA AND NONE OF US WERE TOLD ABOUT AHEAD OF TIME THAT CHANGE. THAT'S WHY I CAN'T I CAN'T THINK THAT OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT MY AREA OF EXPERTISE BUT- WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WE ARE LOOKING AT WAYS THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT. ON SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE ALREADY OPEN AND THAT HAVE NOT HAD SEARCHES OR OUTBREAKS OF INFECTION I'M CAN ALSO BENEFIT FROM THIS PROGRAM IS FILE AND NOT HAVE TO BE CLOSED SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW I'M TRYING TO FIND SOME SOLUTIONS FOR. OKAY. SAID MR GALLAGHER YES I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT I FULLY SUPPORT THE FIRST THING THAT MR GALLAGHER BROUGHT UP AS FAR AS THE DEFERRALS FOR K. TWELVE AND FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES- NOT TO MENTION THAT WE'RE ANTICIPATING GETTING MORE MONEY IN MAY FROM INCREASE REVENUES JUST FROM THE ECONOMY ARE TAX RECEIPTS PLUS WE HAVE THIS INFUSION OF FEDERAL MONEY COMING UPGRADE IT'S ONLY ONE TIME BUT- WE'RE- LOOKING AT POTENTIALLY. THIRTEEN BILLION ON TOP OF THE SIX WE ALREADY GOT SO. I THINK THAT WE OWE IT TO OUR SCHOOLS- TO MAKE THEM HOLD ITS IS SMART BUDGETARY PRACTICE SO I WITH THAT NEXT WE HAVE SOME MEMBER OF DONALD ON THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BY ADONIS. I THANK YOU MISTER TURNER IS GOING TO BRING UP DEFERRALS AS WELL BUT IT'S BEEN ALREADY DISCUSSED SO I JUST WANT TO KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT ISSUE- I HAVE A QUESTION WITH REGARD AT THE BUDGET- YEAH THE PERSON STIRS PAY DOWN. A FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IS VERY IMPORTANT TO PAY THESE FUNDS DOWN PAY THIS LONG TERM DEBT DOWN. BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH MONEY COMMITTED TO THEM IN THE PAST- SO. ARE YOU INCREASING THE STANDARD PAYMENT. IN PERSON STIRS THIS YEAR OR IS IT JUST THE STANDARD PAYMENT. I SEE EIGHT HUNDRED AND- TWENTY MILLION FIRSTERS. THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION FOR PERS ARE THOSE THAT OTHERS THE STANDARD. PAYMENTS ARE THOSE AN INCREASE. IN IN THE STANDARD PATTERN. YES THANK YOU SO MEMBER O'DONNELL AND THOSE TWO PAYMENTS ARE AND INCREASED ABOVE WHAT WE WOULD NORMALLY BE PAYING AND THOSE AND PAYMENTS WERE SCHEDULED AS PART AS- THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT AN AGREEMENT THAT WE HAD WE HAD AT PLANNED FOR THOSE THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT- BUT THEY ARE ADDITIONAL PAYMENT. OVER OUR NORMAL PAYMENT HE SAID THAT WOULD BE EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION ALONE TO STIRS ABOVE THE. REQUIRED OR STANDARD PAYMENT IS THAT ACCURATE. IS ACCURATE YES OKAY THE IN ONE YEAR. IS THAT IN OUR TWENTY THAT'S A HUNDRED TWENTY ONE ONE YOU'RE CORRECT. IN ONE YEAR YES TO PAY DOWN THE EMPLOYEE EMPLOYER. GREAT SO- HOW MANY OR DO YOU YEAH I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE THIS INFORMATION WAS THERE IT WAS THERE ARE MULTI YEAR COMMITMENT MADE. TO PAY DOWN. THAT DEBT YES SO THERE WAS I IS IT IS IT AND THIS YEAR DOESN'T NEED TO CONTINUE AFTER THIS YOUR ORDERED OR DOES IT WHERE'S WHERE'S THAT DISCUSSION. THE MULTI YEAR DEAL WAS TO PAY DOWN THE EMPLOYER SHARE OF COSTS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AS WELL AS MAKE- PAYMENTS INTO THE LONG TERM AGAINST THE LONG TERM LIABILITY- HOWEVER DEBT PAY DOWN OF THE EMPLOYER RATE IS NOT CURRENTLY SCHEDULED IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE OR BEYOND. OKAY SO WE WOULD HAVE TO RE UP THAT EFFORT. GOING FORWARD CORRECT. AND I THINK THAT THAT THAT'S ERY IMPORTANT IS THE ULTIMATE IMPACT IS THAT. IT TABS DOWN THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH STORES IN PERSON THE OUT YEARS FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. SO ISEE IT DROPPING FROM 18% ROUGHLY TWO. FIFTY THE HIGH END OF 15% AND THAT'S A GOOD THING SO THIS PAYDOWNS ARE VERY IMPORTANT- I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT- THEN ALSO SHE FIFTEEN MILLION. FOR THE CRADLE TO GRAVE DATA SYSTEM- I GUESS I'LL JUST ISSUE AN OPINION- I JUST SEE A DISASTER COMING I DON'T KNOW WHY WE NEED THIS THING- AND- WE HAVEN'T HAD TREMENDOUS SUCCESS IN THE STATE WITH OUR DATA SYSTEMS ESPECIALLY DURING CREATE A NEW ONE. I JUST HOPE WE'RE VERY THOUGHTFUL ON WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS REALLY NECESSARY AND IF THESE DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT IN AN EFFECTIVE MANNER. AND WITHOUT IT I AM VERY I DON'T NEED COMMENT BACK FROM YOU. BUT- THERE IS THE YOU. OKAY THANK YOU. NUMBER SO MY QUESTION IS AROUND THE BILLION DOLLARS AND BE OUT OR THE BILLION BEING ALLOCATED FOR THEM WITH THE RE FOR RE OPENING- IN MY DISTRICT MY AND THE THIRTIETH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT- HALF OF MY SCHOOLS ARE OPEN IN VENTURA COUNTY AND THEN MY LOS ANGELES- PORTION OF THE DISTRICT AND THE SCHOOLS ARE CLOSED AND THERE ARE SOME SERIOUS CONCERN- OVER THE COST OF TESTING OVER THE LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE- FOR TESTING- THE RESPONSIBILITY AND REALLY MY DISTRICTS ARE ALREADY THINKING IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO FIND SUBSTITUTES. YET ALONE I'M PERSONALITY HELP- WITH THE TESTING- CADENCE UNDER THE GUIDELINES- BUT REALLY- THE N. AND CHAIRMAN- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THE TEST THAT WE'RE TAKING NOW IF YOU LOOK THEM UP ONLINE THEIR UPWARDS OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE DOLLARS AND I'VE HEARD A COUPLE HUNDRED DOLLARS SO A LOT OF MY DISTRICT ARE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN HELP AND THEY'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO APPLY AND WHETHER THEY SHOULD APPLY FOR THESE GRANTS. BUT REALLY- WHEN I LOOK AT THIS TWO BILLION DOLLARS BEING ALLOCATED FROM PROP NINETY EIGHT I'M DOLLARS MY QUESTION IS THERE AN EXISTING PRECEDENT IN WHICH PROP NINETY EIGHT DOLLARS ARE USED TO FUND A HEALTH CARE PROGRAM OR STRATEGY- IMPLEMENTED BY DISTRICTS TO THE TUNE OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF YOU KNOW BILLION DOLLARS OR EVEN. A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. AND I HAVE SOME UPS WELL. CERTAINLY AND SO I'LL IT SHOULD THE FIRST POINT YOU MADE ABOUT THE COST OF THE TASK. UNTIL I JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT TO THE EXTENSION LEN PARTICIPATE IN THE VALENCIA ALLOWED PROGRAM ON THE CURRENT COST PROTEST THERE IS FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS PER CAST- AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT ONE- ONE PARTICIPATION INCREASES BEYOND A CERTAIN POINT. THAT WILL DROP TO THIRTY EIGHT DOLLARS PER CAST AND WE ARE ALSO LOOKING AT OPTIONS AROUND APPROVING- TO REDUCE COSTS EVEN FURTHER. SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEING WORKED ON- WE ARE A WAY FROM THE FEDERAL. RUN MEDICARE HELP TO ENSURE THAT THE COST OF TESTING. FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE ALL ITS COVERAGE ABOUT PROGRAMS THAT ARE TWO PIECES. ON YOUR ON YOUR QUESTION ABOUT PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT THE APPROPRIATENESS OF USING IT- SO I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT CURRENTLY SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE USING- THANK YOU TO FIND A TESTING- AND IN THE END IN OUR NORMAL. IN A NORMAL. SCHOOL YEAR. AND USE THAT FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY CLASSES WELL- GIVEN THE HEALTH AND SAFETY IS AN IMPORTANT PIECES PROVIDING AND- IN ADDITION YOU KNOW WE HAVE. WE HAVE. FUNDING FOR SCHOOL YOU KNOW THE LVF ANYTHING USED FOR SCHOOL NURSES- THERE ARE MANY MEDICAL COSTS FOR. US STUDENTS MEET BECAUSE THE SOLICITATION OR OTHER- NEEDS THAT ARE COVERED- WITH PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT AND- SO I JUST. YOU KNOW THOSE ARE SOME IN INSTANCES WHEN NINETY EIGHT HUNDRED USED FOR PURPOSES. LIKE I'M SO AS A FOLLOW UP- MY QUESTION KNOW I HAVE SOME SMALL DISTRICTS IN THE THIRTY THE- TO. AND IS THERE DISCUSS. AROUND AUGMENTING THE BASE RATE FOR SMALLER DISTRICTS WITHIN OF IT BUT- TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED OR THREE THOUSAND EIGHTY EIGHT. ON THAT REALLY DON'T HAVE A LARGE ENOUGH FINANCIAL ABILITY- APPARATUS. TO EXECUTE THIS CD PH REQUIREMENTS. YEAH YOU KNOW I THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND- I WILL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT ONE AND ALSO I NEED TO CHECK WITH MY PUBLIC HEALTH FOLKS ABOUT HOW THEY ARE. AND HOW THEY'RE WORKING WITH THEIR SMALLER DISTRICTS I CAN SAY THAT GENERALLY SPEAKING TO THE EXTENT THAT SMALLER DISTRICTS HAVE ISSUES AROUND INFRASTRUCTURE THEY GENERALLY WORK FOR THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION TO HELP. THREE EIGHT- YOU KNOW IT- AT. STATE YET EFFICIENT THE ABOUT AND LARGER NUMBERS AS A STUDENT INTERFERE LARGE NUMBERS OF TESTING IN PROVIDED THAT I HAVE TO DOUBLE CHECK ON YOU ON THAT QUESTION FOR YOU- WITH MY PUBLIC HEALTH FOLKS AND WHAT THEIR GUIDANCE ARE GETTING TO THE SMALLER DISTRICTS. GREAT M. AND MY LAST QUESTION- IS AROUND A FOR ALSO ON THE INTERNET REITERATE MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SUGGESTED AND THAT IT IT I THINK IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE OUR DISTRICTS HOLE BUT I JUST DO HAVE A QUESTION IN REGARDS TO ONE OF THE LAST TIME THAT THE STATE REQUIRED DISTRICT DEFERRALS FOR WHAT AMOUNT OR WHAT WAS THAT TOTAL. I'M WANT TO THE STATE PAY BACK THE DEFERRALS AND DOES THE STATE PAY INTEREST. ON DEFERRALS THAT COLLECT INTEREST. SO V. AND DELVED INTO. RECESSION WE- I THINK THE TOTAL NUMBER OF DEFERRAL THAT WE BUILT THAT TOO WAS JUST SHY OF ELEVEN BILLION CREDIT RUN ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS- AND THAT WAS DONE OVER A PERIOD OF MANY YEARS. AND THEN THOSE DEFERRALS WERE PAID OFF I THINK THE LAST DEFERRAL. WEDNESDAY WAS- WAS PUT INTO PLACE FOR INCREASED- I WANT TO SAY WAS ELEVEN TWELVE- I THINK MY COLLEAGUES WHO MIGHT BE IN ONE OF THE AT THE OTHER PANEL CAN- CAN VERIFY THAT NUMBER- AND THEN WE PAY IT OFF OVER SEVERAL YEARS. AND I THINK OUR FINAL PAYMENT I WANT TO STAY WITHIN FOURTEEN FIFTEEN- AGAIN I MIGHT MY COLLEAGUE ERIN HAD IDEA CAN. ANSWER THAT QUESTION PROBABLY BETTER THAN I CAN. AND IN TERMS OF- INTERESTS NO THE STATE OF NEW PAY. FOR INTEREST. WITH THE FOR. AND ONE THING TO FOR HONORABLY BIT COMP- BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I YOU CAN NOTICE THAT GENERALLY SPEAKING- ATTACHED LETTER GIRLS LIKE THE ONES ARE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW- ARE SHORT TERM CASH FLOW LOANS THAT ARE PAID OFF. IN A MATTER OF MONTHS- IT IT APPEARS AS THOUGH THEY CONTINUE OVER SEVERAL YEARS. BUT WHAT WE ACTUALLY DO WITH THE PAY OFF THE LOAN IMMEDIATELY AND THEN IN THE FOLLOWING FISCAL YEAR- AND THEN TAKE OUT NEW DEFERRALS ESSENTIALLY- AT THE END OF THE NEXT FISCAL YEARS NOW ACTUALLY. EXTEND OVER MULTIPLE YEAR PERIOD THEY ARE- SHORT TERM CASH BALANCE JUST IN THEIR NATURE- YEAH I WOULD I WOULD JUST BURN FROM THE SPECIFICS TO MY COLLEAGUE AND ONE OF THE FUTURE PANELS BUT- BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING THAT IS. THAT. IS THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SOMEONE TAKE. THANK YOU MISS JUST THIRTY TO GO BACK TO OF THE- COMMENTS FROM THE STATE SUPREME- YOU KNOW IN A LETTER. THE GOVERNOR AT THE SEVEN DISTRICTS. SEVEN LARGEST DISTRICTS HAVE CONCERNS OVER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WE VERY MUCH. APPRECIATE THE PROPOSAL AND WANT TO WORK VERY CLOSELY SO THAT WE ALL HAVE THE SAME GOALS. TO SAFELY FIND A PATH TO OPEN UP SCHOOLS. CAN CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE HOW THOSE DISCUSSIONS ARE GOING WITH THE- SEVEN LARGE DISTRICTS AND I KNOW THAT- YOU REFERRED TO MEETINGS WITH YOUR- THE HEALTH TEAM IN. TRY TO GET GREATER CLARITY OVER- WHAT YOU COULD DO TO YOU KNOW PROVIDE. LATER GUIDANCE TO HELP THEM. SO WE'VE BEEN MEETING WITH WITH MANY ELEAZAR ANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS INCLUDING- REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE SEVEN LARGEST- AND THEIR NEEDS REALLY ARE DIFFERENCE DEPENDING ON THE L. E. A. AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW MANY TO MENTION THAT YOU HAVE TESTING PLANS IN PLACE FOR OUR TEACHERS AND FOR SOME OF THEM IN THE TESTING AS STUDENTS THAT IS A CONCERNS- AT THE OTHER PIECE IS AND THAT WE HEAR QUITE A BIT AND THEN INTO CONCERNS AROUND THE TIGHTENING AND HOW MUCH TIME THEY WILL HAVE. TO RENEGOTIATE WITH- WITH THEIR AT THEIR HOUSE BY TEACHERS UNIONS- AS WELL AS AND TRY TO GET THERE YOU KNOW COMMUNITIES ON BOARD- I THINK THE LAST BLAST YOUR CONSISTENT- FEEDBACK THAT WE'VE GOTTEN. FROM FOLKS AND IS AROUND. AND THE CONCERN TOOK HAS THAT THE- CONCERN FAMILIES A TEN TO CHILDREN- YOU KNOW WHILE WILD. RATES ARE HIGH AND YOU KNOW CONCERNED ABOUT SAFETY- AND THEN ALSO VACCINATIONS AND HAD TO HAVE DEFINITELY BEEN PART OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS- AS WELL AS CONCERNED ABOUT- AS- PERSONNEL RESOURCES SO. WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE ENOUGH. TEACHERS ARE CLASSIFIED STAFF. TO SUPPORT THOSE PROGRAMS THOSE ARE ALL ISSUES THAT WERE I'M DISCUSSING I LOOK AT LEAST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND BETTER SO THAT WE CAN. AND MAKE THE CHANGES PROPOSAL TO MAKE IT MORE AFFORDABLE FOR THOSE FOLKS. GREAT THANK YOU. DO YOU GET A SENSE THAT WILL DPH P. DESTROYING A REVISED GUIDELINES. THEN BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE THEM. THE REAL OF THE ISSUE WE'VE BEEN ABOUT THIS SEEM. BASED ON THE THEME IN THIS THAT I'VE HAD WITH AND IT'S OF LIKE. MONEY BEEN THAT MAIN HURDLE IT'S- THEIR SENSE OF. NEEDING CLEAR GUIDANCE AND CLEAR DIRECTION. YEAH I CERTAINLY CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THEY WILL SAY THAT THE GUIDANCE THAT DATE THEY PUT OUT I KNOW IT FEELS LIKE THEY'RE CONSTANTLY KIND BEING RELEASED BUT- REALLY THE ONLY APPEALING TO PEOPLE TO KIND OF PUT OUT HAVE BEEN IN AUGUST AND IN THE THREE POINT LINE AND- THEY WORK REALLY HARD TO ENSURE THAT. WHAT THEY DO PUT OUT IS BASED ON THE BEST SCIENCE THAT THEY HAVE AT THE TIME BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE DEFINITELY GET KIDS BACK INT SCHOOL THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S DONE SAFELY IN DOESN'T EXACERBATE THE CURRENT SITUATION WHICH WE FIND OURSELVES. I'M HOWEVER I THINK THAT WHERE THE INTERSECTION OF THE GUIDANCE AND THE GRANT ARE CONCERNED I THINK THAT'S DEFINITELY AN AREA WHERE. WE'RE LOOKING AT YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IS GOING TO BE- REQUIRED AND TO PARTICIPATE IN THE GRANT AS IT CONNECTS TO THE GUIDANCE SO. I THINK THAT I THINK THAT'S A REALLY KEY AREA. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. GRADING DON'T THINK WE WOULD. WE WOULD CONCUR AS WELL AS A NEW. I DON'T THINK YOU WERE AT OUR HEARING AND I THINK IT WAS. OCTOBER OR NOVEMBER- THAT WE WE'VE BEEN. WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR. QUITE A WHILE FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE TO COME OUT- THEN GOT GOING TO THE DISTRICTS OUTSIDE OF THE- LARGE SEVEN DISTRICTS HAVE YOU GOTTEN FEEDBACK. IN TERMS OF- WITH THIS PROPOSAL BE ENOUGH FOR THEM TO. OPEN UP OR FOR. THEM TO SAY THE MAJORITY OF THEM TO MOVE FORWARD OPEN UP. YEAH YOU KNOW IT OBVIOUSLY AS YOU WELL KNOW AND THERE IS SUCH A DIVERSE CITY AND SITUATIONS ACROSS THE STATE- AND SOME DISTRICTS ARE- ARE IN A PLACE WHERE THEIR INFECTION RATES ARE SO HIGH- THAT IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THEY'LL BE ABLE TO OPEN UP ANY TIME SOON- AND- I. IT WHAT WHAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO ENCOURAGE FOR THOSE DISTRICTS IS OBVIOUSLY NOT AT THE OPEN IF THEY'RE INFECTION RATES ARE INCREDIBLY HIGH THAT. THAT THEY'RE PLANNING FOR WHEN WE OPENING AS POSSIBLE AND I THINK THAT WE DO BELIEVE THAT OUR PROPOSAL WILL ENCOURAGE- AT LEAST TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE PLANS IN PLACE AND I THINK THAT'S A REALLY CRUCIAL POINT THAT EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT IN THE PLACE WHERE YOU CAN OPEN RIGHT NOW. THAT YOU ARE READY TO GO WHEN YOUR INFECTION RATES DROPPED LOW ENOUGH TO MAKE IT SAFE- BECAUSE I THINK BUT ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE IS THAT. WE'RE NOT CAUGHT FLAT FOOTED- AS AS YOU WELL KNOW AND AS I MENTIONED IN THE LAST HEARING YOU KNOW I THINK WE ALL THOUGHT BACK AT LAST MARCH THAT. WILL CLOSURES WERE GONNA LAST YOU FOR A EW WEEKS AND THEN WE GO BACK IN AND THEN THEY CAN CHANGES PRESS ON AND THEN YOU KNOW WE- FINISH THE SCHOOL YEAR AND DISTANCE LEARNING AND YOU KNOW IT IS DONE SO ON AND SO FORTH AND SO I THINK OUR- ONE OF OUR MAIN HE'S- AND GOLD WITH THIS GRANT. IS NOT ONLY TO GET AS MANY PEOPLE BACK IN PERSON AS WE CAN. I'M IN A SAFE MANNER WHERE IT IS SAFE TO DO SO BUT ALSO TO MAKE SURE THAT. THOSE ELEAZAR THAT ARE. IN HIGH TRANSMISSION AREAS ARE READY TO GO AS SOON AS A DISTINCT IDENTITY THEFT. THE HOME SOME WITH ALL DUE RESPECT WE. WE DID THAT IN THE- IN THE JULY BUDGET. WE GAVE ELEAZAR FIVE BILL. DOLLARS ON. I THINK WE'LL ALL. OF PAST OUT BUDGET. IN IN THE SUMMER THIS OPTION WAS EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID THAT THEY WERE GOING TO BE READY THEY WERE GONNA DO THEIR TAKE A SUMMER WE GAVE THEM FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. TO GET READY TO OPEN IN THE FALL AND WHAT WE SAW IS. ON HOW DO YOU KNOW AUGUST HIT. AND TRANSMISSION LEVELS WERE WERE LOW MUCH MUCH LOWER THAN THEY ARE TODAY. AND YET- YOU KNOW I WOULD I WOULD DISAGREE DO YOU ARE YOU MAKE YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU SEE. YOU KNOW ELLIE IS ALL OVER THE PLACE ACTUALLY- HE'S ACTING VERY CONSISTENTLY I THINK OVER YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT THE SITUATION MAY BE DIFFERENT. THEIR BEHAVIOR IS VERY CONSISTENT JUST LIKE A YEAR AGO THEY WERE ALL PRETTY CONSISTENT THEY WERE ALL OPEN. SO AGAIN THERE IS. YOU KNOW WE- I DON'T WANT TO REPEAT WHAT WE DID IN. IN JUNE WHEN WE PASSED A BUDGET. GAVE SCHOOLS WHAT WE BELIEVED WERE ADEQUATE RESOURCES WHAT WE SAW IS. NOT NOT ONLY DID THIS DISTRICTS NOT UTILIZE THOSE RESOURCES IN THE SUMMER. THEY DIDN'T EVEN REALLY UTILIZE THE RESOURCES UNTIL THE FALL YOU DIDN'T EVEN SEE. MOST RESOURCES BEING PULLED DOWN UNTIL DECEMBER WHEN THE DEADLINE WAS COMING. IN SO- YOU KNOW I WANT TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. WE ALL HAVE THE SAME GOALS WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SCHOOLS. BE REOPENED IN THE SAFEST MANNER. PASSABLE pTO REPEAT THE SAME. MISTAKE THAT WE'VE MADE IN THIS LAST BUDGET WERE BECAME DISTRICTS- RESOURCES TO OPEN UP AND WE DID NOT. SEE THAT HAPPEN. IS SO- YOU YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU YOU FEEL THAT THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS COULD BE SPENT TO PREPARE. DISTRICTS TO OPEN UP WHICH WOULD. DID YOU MEAN TO PREPARE THEM TO OPEN UP THIS YEAR OR YOU'RE TALKING IN THE FALL BECAUSE IF WE'RE TALKING IN THE FALL I DON'T I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO DO IN THE- EARLY ACTION WE CAN JUST TAKE ACTION IN. IN JUNE. SO THAT'S A GREAT POINT AND ATKINS. YEAH SO THE DIFFERENCE I THINK ONE OF THE BIG ONE THE MAIN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN WHAT WE DID IN THIS IN THE SUMMER AND IN THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT AND WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING NOW- IS REALLY AROUND- YOU KNOW. THE ACCOUNTABILITY PIECE AND WE GET A FIVE POINT THREE BILLION OUT TO ALL L. YATES REGARDLESS- OF- WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE PLANNING ON OPENING FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AND WE DIDN'T REQUIRE THEM TO OPEN FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION OR TO RECEIVE THOSE FUNDS. WE ALSO TOLD THEM THEY COULD BE USED FOR LEARNING LOSS MITIGATION- DEFENDER VERY TARGETED TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AND BUT WE DECIDED THAT- TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU RECEIVE THE FUNDING YOU DON'T REOPEN WHEN ITS- THE DOSE FUNDS WILL BE TAKEN AWAY THAT THAT YOU WILL SEE IT THREE YOUR ANNUAL AUDIT YOU WILL RECEIVE AN ON A PENALTY IN THE FUNDS WILL BE TAKEN AWAY- SO TO YOUR QUESTION I THINK THERE THERE IS A DIFFERENCE. IN WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING NOW AND WE PROPOSED THIS SUMMER I THINK ALSO YES TO ANSWER YOUR LAST QUESTION ABSOLUTELY- WE WANT PEOPLE TO OPEN UP YOU KNOW EVEN IF IT'S FOR THREE WEEKS BECAUSE THAT YOU KNOW WHEN THEIR RATES GO DOWN LONG ENOUGH. FOR THEM TO REOPEN YES WE WANT THEM TO OPEN THIS YEAR THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT THIS FALL HOWEVER I WAS NOTING EARLIER. ANOTHER BENEFIT IS THAT. I YOU KNOW. LOCAL TO BE READY MORE READY. FOR INSTRUCTIONS WHENEVER THEY RE OPEN- YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT A FULL THIS. TO SAY KNOW- WE ONLY FOUR WEEKS IN THE SCHOOL. THE SCHOOL YEAR YEAH I KNOW IT A FRESH OPEN RIGHT- BUT WE'RE JUST NOT GONNA GET WE'RE JUST GONNA WAIT FOR THE FALL THE ONE. THOSE FOLKS TO TAKE THOSE FOR WEEKS INTO THE MOST OF NOTHING. CAN FOR THE- OF THEIR- AND IS FOR. IN PART OF THE PROPOSAL. THANK YOU THANK YOU AND THAT'S- OF THE LOOK AT. WE WERE- YOU KNOW I PERSONALLY. OTHER ON- PUTTING THIS FORWARD A PUTTING THIS PROPOSAL FORWARD. I THINK IT'S STILL. NEEDS TO. BE DISCUSSED FURTHER BUT WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT AND WE REALLY HOPE THAT WE CAN FIND. FIND A PATH THAT WE CAN. ACHIEVE THE GOAL THAT WE ALL SHARE WHICH IS TO TRY TO GET. SCHOOLS OPENED UP AS SAFELY AS POSSIBLE AND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I'M WE DID KIND OF. CHANGE THAT SCHEDULES MORNING A BIT BECAUSE- WE WANTED TO ACCOMMODATE- THE- JESSICA HOMES AND APARTMENT OF FINANCE- BUT- WE DO HAVE THIS OTHER BUDGET. WITH WITH TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN THIS. BUDGET YEAR PROPOSAL THAT WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT AS WELL BUT- THIS IS PRIORITY RIGHT NOW WE'RE GONNA BE RUNNING ON THIS IN A COUPLE WEEKS. IN THE FULL COMMITTEE SO WE WANTED TO. TALK A BIT ABOUT THIS WHICH WE DID. SO NOW I WANT TO GO BACK AND LET THE L. I KNOW LMAO. IS HERE WITH US. AND IF YOU CAN GIVE US RUN THROUGH. ANY MAYBE OUGHT TO GET THE WHOLE PIECE BUT ANY. PIECES YOU THINK ARE IMPORTANT FOR US TO CONSIDER. ON THE IN PERSON INSTRUCTION GRANT PROPOSAL. AND THEN IF ELLIE- CAN GO OVER YOUR- ANALYSIS OF THE- OVERALL. PROP NINETY EIGHT BY PROPOSALS FOR THE. TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET. PRETTY MEMBERS THIS IS A WE WILL THE LARGEST ANALYST'S OFFICE. I AM SO THINK IT WORTHWHILE PRIVILEGE. TO EXPLORE WAYS TO ENCOURAGE SCHOOLS TO REOPEN ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNGER CHILDREN AND HIGH NEED STUDENTS. HOWEVER AS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS CURRENTLY CRAFTING IT WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT HOW EFFECTIVE THE COUPLES WILL BE. ANNOUNCEMENT WE GETTING SCHOOLS REOPENED EARLIER.AND WE HAVE A FEW ISSUES FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER AS WELL AS OPTIONS TO SUPPORT SCHOOL RE OPENING. AND MEMBERS HAVE ALREADY RAISED MOST OF THESE ISSUES AND IT SOUNDS LIKE DISCUSSIONS ARE UNDER WAY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE CONCERNS. SO I'LL JUST SHARE MY POINTS RATHER BRIEFLY- SIX TO COMPLETE THE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. TO MEET THE FEBRUARY ONE DEADLINE WHICH IS AGAIN NEXT MONDAY. DISTRICTS WOULD HAVE VERY LITTLE TIME TO UPDATE THEIR SCHOOL REOPENING PLANS ARRANGE FOR ROUTINE TESTING. AND AGO SHEET WITH OUR LABOR UNIONS. SECONDLY WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE CAPACITY OF THE STATE AGENCIES AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR SCHOOL REOPENING. FOR INSTANCE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES NO AUGMENTATION TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. OR THE LOCAL COUNTY BUDGETS TO SUPPORT THIS ADDITIONAL WORK- LASTLY WE KNOW THAT THE PROPOSAL AS CURRENTLY STRUCTURED IS UNLIKELY TO BE TO EARLIER IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. AND AGAIN ON THEIR TWO REASONS FOR THIS. FIRST THE ROUTINE THERE ARE. FOR ROUTINE A SYMPTOMATIC TESTING AS OFTEN. EVERY WEEK FOR ALL STUDENTS AND STAFF. ADDS MORE COMPLEX WITH JUST A GOAL CHALLENGES TO SCHOOL REOPENING WHICH ALSO ALREADY RATHER. COMP ENDEAVOR IS- SECOND COPE NINETEEN SPRAYED ARE HIGH. THIS CURRENT YOU GREAT THAN A HUNDRED. PER HUNDRED PEOPLE. AS A JUNIOR NINETEEN. ONLY COUNTY POSSIBLE. THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PER. THAT WOULD BE ALLOW ONLY TWO SCHOOLS TO REOPEN. CAN WORDS. RIGHT NOW WE THINK. NOT ACTUALLY. IN MUCH INTEREST INSTRUCTION INSTEAD. NOW THE LEGISLATURE A FEW OPTIONS CONSIDER AND MOSTLY BECAUSE I. ARE GEARED TO ADDRESS THE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE- FIRST AND I JUST COULD. THE PROPOSAL TO PUT SCHOOL TO OPT IN PER AND- TO ALL HIDING TO. A MONTH BEFORE THE OTHER L. GRADES THIS ALLOWS AND TIME TO RAMP UP THEIR TESTING. AND OTHER ABLE. CHALLENGES A SMALL GROUP STUDENTS AND STAFF FIRST WHILE STILL. IN PERSON. TO STUDENTS WITH LARGE BETTER FROM IT. SECONDLY AND I JUST COULD CAN IT. SOME FOR. IS ON THE EAST. TO REQUIRE. I GET AND- AS MEMBERS ARE READY MENTIONED. THAT OF THE- MOST LIKELY TO DAMPEN SCHOOL. THE LEGISLATURE COULD PROVIDE JUST WITHIN OUR TO DEVELOPING ALTERNATE TESTING KIT AND MOTHER LABOR PARTNERS. OR ALLOW DISTRICTS TEST ALL STAFF. BUT RANDOM SAMPLED STUDENTS. THIS APPROACH JUST LIKE. THAT GINGRICH AREN'T LOWER OF TRANCE CODED. WHILE MAKING IT WOULD. TESTING MORE. LAST APART FROM THE PROPOSAL THE- COULD ALSO AT WAYS TO INCREASE STATE TESTING. AND IN FOR. THAT ALLOW SCHOOLS TO MORE EASE ACCESS ROUTINES. ALL THAT MANY HAS. SCHOOLS ACCESS TO STATE'S BILL BROWN LAB IT UP MARK REALLY FAST AND THE TESTING CAPACITIES ASIDE FOR SCHOOLS. NUMBER KEY POINTSAND OPTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS IF THERE ARE ANY THANK YOU ALL. OKAY. HEARING NONE RIGHT NOW WE WANT TO ALLOW. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION'S REPRESENTATIVE TO ENGAGE ON THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET PROPOSAL AS WELL. NOW THEY'RE GONE. OKAY YEAH SORRY ABOUT THAT SO. L. A. L. CAN YOU ALSO DO YOUR SECOND PRESENTATION. I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR I THINK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MIGHT HAVE SOME OPENING COMMENTS ON THE GUARANTEE IN THEIR PROPOSALS AND IF- WE MAY I'D LIKE TO- BUT THEM I TAKE GO AHEAD AND START WITH THAT. YOUR. RIGHT HI GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ARENARIA DEPARTMENT FINANCE I'M GONNA TRY TO KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF BUT AS MANY OF YOU HAVE MENTIONED THROUGHOUT THE MORNING SO FAR THERE ARE A LOT OF DYNAMICS AT PLAY MOST NOTABLY- THE REVENUE INCREASE OF COURSE BEEN MENTIONED SEVERAL TIMES SO- HERE WE GO COMPARED TO- THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT THE FIGURE OUR REVENUE TARGET MENTIONED EVERY BALLOT BY ON PRESIDENT AMOUNT ALMOST SEVENTY BILL DOLLARS OVER THE THREE YEAR PERIOD COMPARED TO- THE PROJECTIONS. AT BUDGET ACT- MOST ABOUT DUE TO. THE CORRECT THE ARRESTED TAX FOR IN CALIFORNIA I- I'M FORCING HEALTH OF THE STOCK CAPITAL GAINS WILL AGAIN TO THE ORIGINAL PER. ABA TEST ONE BEING OFFERED IT THE YEAR- THE GUARANTEE WILL CALL FOR ABOUT THIRTY EIGHT ON THE DOLLAR EVERY NEW- DOLLAR THAT THAT WE RECEIVED ABOUT PROJECT- I'M NOT SURE. IN ANYTHING. AND THAT I CAN TRY FISCALLY. YEAH UP TO TOTAL OF ABOUT NINE AND A HALF BILLION. A ONE POINT BILLION INCREASE OVER THE AFTER INTO BY JACKSON JUNE. TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE MINIMUM GUARANTEED UP ABOUT A POINT NINE A BILLION DOLLARS YOU CAN MAKE UP THE INACTIVE. FOR A FOR A TOTAL INTO TWENTY ONE OF EIGHTY POINT EIGHT BILLION. AND THE INCREASE IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. OVER THE TOP TWENTY TWENTY ONE LEVEL AT THE STATE BUDGET ACT I IS ABOUT FOURTEEN POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS AND I KNOW THE SUMMER PEOPLE OUTSIDE THAT NUMBER AS WELL- AND NOT THE- TOTAL- MINIMUM GUARANTEED CALCULATION. EIGHTY FIVE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS TO TWENTY ONE TWENTY. FIVE NOW AT THE BUDGET ACT IN RECOGNITION OF THIS EXTREME DROP IN REVENUE THAT WAS ORIGINALLY PART. AND IMPACT WITH THE DIRECT IMPACT I WAS GONNA HAVE TO KEEP FORTY FUNDING THE GUARANTEE AT THE TIME. I TRAILER BILL LESLIE WITHIN IN A TO REQUIRE. SUPPLEMENTARY PAIN TO BE MADE ON AN ANNUAL FOR YEARS IN ACCESS THE POP NINE EIGHT MINIMUM. CAL NOW WITH TO BEGIN IN TWO ONE TO TWO AND THE WOULD BE TO ONE A HALF. OF TOTAL SOUND GENERAL FUND REVENUES- AS WELL THERE WAS THEY TEST ONE SHARE OF GENERAL FUND REVENUES LEAD BENCH THAT WAS PROPOSED WITHIN THEIR- WHICH WOULD TAKE BE PERMANENT ONGOING SHARE OF THE GENERAL FUND REVENUES FROM FORTY PERCENT- ON AN ONGOING BASIS. NOW WITH THE- REVENUE AGAINST ME RECOVER- BACK MORE CLOSELY IN LINE THE KIND OF. FREAK PROJECT. THOUGH STILL NO QUITE HEALTHY AS WE HAD ORIGINALLY THOUGHT- THE- LOS. WE'RE TO BY TO ELIMINATE PAYMENTS IN TWO TWO TO THREE AND JUST A WANT. TWENTY ONE TO TWO YEAR. OF POINT THREE BILLION OR EQUAL TO ONE OF PERCENT OF TOLD SO CHEN. GENERAL FUND REVENUES AT THE GOVERNOR'S. THAT BRINGS THE TOTAL PROPOSED PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT HUNDRED LOVE. IN THE BUT TO EIGHTY POINT ONE BILLION. WHICH AN INCREASE OF NOW SEVENTY POINT BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE- TWENTY TWO ONE LEVEL. OF YEAR. AFTERNOON TO PROBABLY TWO WELL WHICH FABULOUS THE PROPOSITION NINETY PER- THE GOVERNOR'S BUT SB THAT THE- WILL BE WERE. INTERNET INVOLVED TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY ONE TWO CLEAR IN THE AMOUNT OF SEVEN FORTY SEVEN TO DOLLARS AND TWO POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS RESPECTIVELY. AS A RESULT OF MANY OF YOU HAVE ALREADY LIKELY HEARD THAT 3% RESERVE BALANCE. WOULD BE MET IN THIS CASE. I WHICH WOULD REQUIRES DISTRICTS OUR CAP TO GOING TO A- BEGINNING IN TWO TWENTY THREE I'M HAPPY TO CHECK MORE ABOUT THAT LATER BUT MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO I KNOW THAT WE AND MAKES COMMENTS THERE AS WELL- TO BUY. ACT INCLUDE. ELEVEN EXCUSE ME THE BUDGET INCLUDE HELLO BILLION DOLLAR IN NOT CASE ALL THE PORTS BEFORE. ABOUT TWELVE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLAR IN TOTAL K. WE CAN COLLEGE SUPPORT OF PEARLS AFFECTING MONTHS SEGUE THROUGH JUNE OF TWO TWENTY- THE GOVERNOR BUDGET PROPOSED FOR. RETIRE BILLS TO ALL THIS MENTIONED HERE LET'S HEARING- THROUGH BY JULY JOURNAL SO BASICALLY PAYING BACK IN THE ORIGINALLY OP IN- REPAYMENT MONTHS. AND THEN WE'RE ALSO ADDITIONAL DEFERRAL THREE POINT SEVEN BILL DOLLARS HE TWELVE SIDE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLAR ON THE- COLLEGE SIDE- SHOULD BE DEFERRED FROM TWO ONE TWENTY TWO IN TWENTY. TWENTY FOR A THAT BUT CALL OF ABOUT SEVEN THREE DOLLAR US. WITH K. TWELVE BUDGET FOR ALL P. DOWN IN ONE TWENTY TWO- AS WELL AS AS WE'VE ALREADY. TALKED ABOUT- EARLIER THE- BUDGET ALSO PROVIDES EFFORT TO. PROVIDE A LIAISE WITH RESOURCES TO TAKE OPEN. WHEN APPROPRIATE ME AND ALSO DIRECT RESOURCES JUNE MOST OF. IMPACTED BY THE- WE'RE PROPOSING SIX SIX GOING DOLLARS IN ONE TIME AND ARE YAK OLD. SEVERAL OTHER ADDITIONAL SPENDING PROPOSAL THAT WE CAN GET INTO ON THIS PANEL AS WELL AS IN A- LATER PENALTY TODAY'S HEARING- WITH THAT I'LL ON MY COMMENTS FOR THE MOMENT AND- DALY- SPEAKING HAPPY TO. ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. ON THIS OKAY THANK YOU L. A. M. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CAN COUPON WITH THE ANALYST OFFICE. I THINK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE GIVE YOU A GOOD OVERVIEW OF WHAT'S IN THIS BUDGET SO ALL AT JUST A FEW DETAILS AND THEN TURN TO OUR COMMENTS. WE ALSO HAND OUT WITH THIS INFORMATION THAT'S AVAILABLE ONLINE AT OUR WEBSITE ELADIO DOT CA DOT GOV. SO STARTING WITH THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE. ELEVEN POINT NINE BILLION INCREASE IN THE GUARANTEE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE REALLY AS A MARKETABLE- THAT IS A 17% INCREASE COMPARED WITH THE- ESTIMATES FROM- JUNE FROM LAST JUNE- BY A WIDE MARGIN THAT'S THE LARGEST INCREASE IN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THE MEASURE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT. AGAIN IT'S ALMOST ENTIRELY A STORY ABOUT GENERAL FUND REVENUE. I REVENUE STARTED TO REBOUND. QUICKLY LAST FALL AND TODAY THEY'RE NEARLY BACK TO PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS MOST OF THE NEW SPENDING ON THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ACTUALLY IS RELATED TO MEETING. IS ONE TIME SPENDING RELATED TO MEETING THAT HIGHER GUARANTEED IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THAT CONTINUE AND WHEN ONE TWENTY. THE GUARANTEED ANOTHER THREE BILLION. OVER THE REVISED TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE LEVEL- BOTH HIGHER GENERAL FUND REVENUE AND HIGHER PROPERTY TAX REVENUE CONTRIBUTE TO THAT. AND ANOTHER TWO POINT THREE BILLION IS PAID ON TOP OF THAT BECAUSE OF THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT- SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS. THE GOVERNOR DR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MENTIONED AT THE THREE BILLION DEPOSITS IN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT RESERVE AND THE FACT THAT THAT FIGURES FOR THE FIRST TIME A CAP ON SCHOOL DISTRICT RESERVES- THAT CAP IS EQUAL ANNUAL EXPENDITURES. MOST DISTRICTS ARE EXEMPT FROM THAT CAMP CAP AUTOMATICALLY IF A DISTRICT HAS TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED OR FEWER STUDENTS IT'S NOT SUBJECT TO THAT CAP- BASED ON THE LATEST DATA THAT WE HAVE A WE ESTIMATE THAT ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MEDIUM LARGE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. I CURRENTLY MAINTAIN RESERVES ABOVE 10% OF THEIR EXPENDITURES. I DISTRICTS COULD RESPOND TO THAT CAP IN A VARIETY OF WAYS THEY COULD BE CLASSIFIED THEIR RESERVES- TO AVOID THE CAP THEY COULD ALSO ASK THE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION TO APPROVE AN EXEMPTION. WE THINK ONE OR TWO OF THOSE APPROACHES ARE THE MOST LIKELY WAY THAT DISTRICTS WOULD RESPOND TO IT- BUT ALTERNATIVELY THEY COULD ALSO RESPOND BY SPENDING DOWN THOSE RESERVES- INTERIM. OF THE GUARANTEE WE THINK THE AT AT THE MOMENTA FINANCES PUT FORWARD A GOOD STARTING POINT FOR THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. OTHER ESTIMATES ARE VERY CLOSE TO OUR IS BOTH IN TERMS OF GENERAL FUND REVENUE AND LOCAL PROPERTY TAX REVENUE. OVER THE THREE YEAR BUDGET PERIOD TWENTY TWO- THEIR ESTIMATES ARE JUST FOUR HUNDRED MILLION ABOVE OURS OVER THAT PERIOD SO REALLY- VERY CLOSE STARTING POINT- THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE WOULD CHANGE ABOUT. FORTY SOMETHING A DOLLAR FOR EACH DOLLAR OF HIGHER LOWER STATE REVENUE. AND GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY THE STATE CASES RIGHT NOW WE THINK SOME CHANGES ARE LIKELY BY MAY- BUT SURPRISINGLY THOSE CHANGES MIGHT NOT MEAN MORE OR LESS FUNDING IS AVAILABLE FOR SCHOOL PROGRAMS. I TO THE EXTENT THAT THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE IS HIGHER THE STATE WOULD LIKELY HAVE TO DEPOSIT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THAT INTO THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT RESERVE. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THE GUARANTEE IS LOWER THE STATE WOULD PROBABLY NEED TO MAKE A SMALLER DEPOSIT. YOU HEARD THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO REVISIT THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS. AND WE THINK THAT'S A REASONABLE IDEA- UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE HAS RECOVERED THE GROUND THAT THE STATE WAS EXPECTING IT TO LOSE BACK IN JUNE- BARRING ANOTHER RECESSION A MINIMUM GUARANTEE LOOKS LIKE WOULD BE ABLE TO SUPPORT- BOTH THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT AS WELL AS OTHER AUGMENTATIONS OVER THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS. ANOTHER CONSIDERATION WHICH IS AN ISSUE FOR THE FULL BUDGET COMMITTEE AS WELL. THAT THE STATE STATE IS FACING A GROWING OPERATING DEFICIT ON THE NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT SIDE OF THE BUDGET- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO MODIFY THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS DOESN'T ELIMINATE THAT OPERATING DEFICIT. BUT IT DOES MAKE IT A LITTLE AT LEAST A LITTLE BIT EASIER TO DEAL WITH. I THINK YOU'VE GOT A GOOD OVERVIEW OKAY ALREADY OF THE SPECIFIC SPENDING PROPOSALS IN THIS BUDGET AGAIN THAT'S NINETEEN NINETEEN POINT ONE BILLION- A NEW PROPOSALS. BUT SIXTEEN POINT FIVE BILLION FOR ONE TIME ACTIVITIES TWO POINT SIX BILLION ONGOING- I'LL ADD JUST A LITTLE BIT OF DETAIL. ON ONE AREA THAT'S IN YOUR GENDER. WHICH IS PENSIONS- SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES BOTH HAVE EXPERIENCED LARGE. INCREASES IN PENSION COSTS OVER THE PAST COUPLE YEARS- THE JUNE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET PLAN PROVIDED TWO POINT THREE BILLION FOR A ONE TIME COST RELIEF. I SPREAD ABOUT EVENLY OVER TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO THE STATE ESSENTIALLY BOUHT DOWN COSTA DISTRICTS WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE PAID OUT OF THE LOCAL OPERATING BUDGETS. EVEN WITH THAT RELEASE KIND OF LOOKING AHEAD TO TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO DISTRICTS ARE STILL LOOKING AT COST INCREASES AT LEAST A COUPLE HUNDRED MILLION POTENTIALLY AS LARGE AS HALF A BILLION. BUT A MUCH LARGER INCREASE- LOOKS LIKELY FOR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE- CURRENT PROJECTIONS ARE THAT. AS THAT ONE TIME RELEASED EXPIRES IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE DISTRICTS MIGHT BE LOOKING AT AN INCREASE. OF AROUND ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS. TURNING TO SOME OF OUR COMMENTS I THINK ONE KEY ASPECT OF THE OF THIS YEAR'S UDGET IS THAT IT CONTAINS A LARGE ONE TIME QUESTION. OF THE FUNDING THAT SPECIFICALLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO A LITTLE OVER FIVE BILLION HISTORY ONE TIME ACTIVITIES AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT FEATURE OF THIS BUDGET BECAUSE THAT HELPS QUESTION THE BUDGET AGAINST SOME OF THE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES- THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. I REDUCING THE LIKELIHOOD OF CUTS TO ONGOING PROGRAM IS- IF REVENUE DOESN'T COME IN AS STRONG AS WE EXPECT EITHER BY NAY OR POTENTIALLY A YEAR FROM NOW. ON THE ECONOMIC SUPPORT PROPOSAL I WON'T GO INTO THAT TOO MUCH YOU'VE ALREADY TALKED TO QUITE A BIT ABOUT THAT- WE WOULD SUGGEST THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT SMALLER AND MORE TARGETED IN THE FOUR POINT SIX BILLION THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PUT FORWARD- AS- AS THE CHAIR AND OTHER MEMBERS MENTIONED ARE. ALREADY DISTRICTS RECEIVED MORE THAN SEVEN BILLION AND ONE TIME FLEXIBLE FUNDS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE- THE LATEST. FEDERAL ACTION DECEMBER IT WILL PROVIDE ROUGHLY ANOTHER SIX BILLION ANYONE TWENTY TWO. AND SO RATHER THAN A THIRD ROUND OF A BROAD PROBABLY FLEXIBLE FUNDING. WE THINK YOU COULD MAKE PROVIDE A SMALLER AUGMENTATION AND MAYBE MAKE SOME MORE PROGRESS AND SOME OF THE KEY PRIORITIES THAT YOU'VE ARTICULATED. AROUND WE OPENING AND MAKING UP FOR FUNDING LOS. UP WE ALSO THINK YOU COULD CONSIDER. A FUNDING A FEW LESS- IF YOU'RE A NEW INITIATIVES- THIS BUDGET HAS AROUND A DOZEN- NEW PROPOSALS ACROSS CHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AROUND HALF I ONE TIME AFTER I'M GOING. AND WE DO THINK SOME OF THOSE PROPOSALS ARE REASONABLE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. BUT THIS IS A LOT TO PUT FORWARD- IN THE MID IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC RIGHT NOW WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT SO MANY NEW PROPOSALS- WITH THAT LARGE NUMBER OF ACTIVITIES THE THEIR INDIVIDUAL IMPACT MIGHT BE DILUTED A LITTLE BIT. AND IT COULD SHIFT ATTENTION AWAY FROM SOME OF THE CORE PROGRAMS AND PRIORITIES THAT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER. AND THEN LASTLY WE RECOMMEND- ALLOCATING MORE FUNDING FOR BOTH PAYING DOWN DEFERRALS AND ADJUSTING PENSION COSTS. UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET A LITTLE OVER FOUR BILLION WOULD REMAIN DEFERRED AT THE END OF TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. WE THINK YOU COULD MAKE MORE PROGRESS ON THAT THAT WOULD GET THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT BUDGET BACK IN BALANCE. I RELY ON GOING- PROGRAM COSTS WITH THE FUNDING THAT'S AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR THOSE PROGRAMS WE THINK THAT MAKES SENSE- WE ALSO THANK YOU COULD- SET ASIDE SOME FUNDING NOW TO DEAL WITH THE LARGE PENSION COST INCREASES THAT'S- LIES AHEAD IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU SET ASIDE EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION YOU COULD PROVIDE A MUCH SMOOTHER- STEP UP FROM. TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE TO TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. WOULD MAKE THOSE COSTS MUCH EASIER FOR DISTRICTS TO DEAL WITH- D. SOME LOCAL BUDGET PRESSURE. AND POTENTIALLY MAKE A DISTRICT PROGRAMS AND OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT THEY'RE PUTTING IN PLACE NOW. EASIER JUST TO SUSTAIN A LONG TERM BASIS. SO I THINK THAT- AND IT CONCLUDES OUR COMMENTS BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ABOUT ARE NOT ANALYSIS OR OTHER PARTS OF THE BUDGET. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER O'DONNELL. YES THANK YOU JUST ONE UNDERSTAND THE NUMBERS CORRECTLY AND I DON'T KNOW THIS QUESTION FOR DEPARTMENT FINANCER WHOEVER THIRTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS TOTAL- I GUESS SURPLUS OR ONE TIME FUNDS FOURTEEN POINT NINE BILLION GOING TO SCHOOLS PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FOURTEEN POINT NINE SO OUT OF THAT FOURTEEN POINT NINE BILLION HOW MUCH THAT IS ONE TIME AND HOW MUCH IS. OF THAT IS ON. THE SOMEONE HAVE THAT INFORMATION. ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL SO I CAN JUST SPEAK TO THE- THAT THE REVENUE NUMBER YOU MENTIONED IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INCREASES IN THE GUARANTEED. AND THEN WITHIN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT WITHIN THAT GROWTH IN THE GUARANTEED ACROSS ALL THREE YEAR IS NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO- THERE'S A TOTAL OF NINETEEN POINT ONE BILLION IN YOUR PROPOSALS. SIXTEEN POINT FIVE BILLION OF THAT IS FOR ONE TIME ACTIVITIES AND TWO POINT SIX BILLION IS FOR ONGOING AUGMENTATIONS MAINLY COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS TO TWO POINT SIX IS COMMENDED OR THERE'S TWO POINT. TWO POINT SIX MILLION. FOR ON GOING. TWO POINT SIX BILLION IN NEW ONGOING PROPOSALS PROPOSALS OKAY RIGHT MAINLY AND REALLY IT'S NOT REALLY NEW ACTIVITIES- IT'S MORE CUTS IT'S CALL YEP IT'S MAINLY THE L. C. F. COLLECT OKAY SO HOW HOW MANAGED IN THE SENATE AND BEEN TRYING TO THINK MY QUESTION HERE IS A- HOW I HOW I OPPOSE IT. BUT SO USE YOU SAYS NO POINT ONE. TOTAL ADDITION TO PROP NINETY EIGHT CORRECT THAT'S THE TOTAL NEW SPENDING ACROSS ALL THREE YEARS RIGHT BUT ONLY TWO POINT SIX BILLION IS COMMENDED ON GOING. THAT'S CORRECT WE WOULD NOTE THAT- MUCH OF THAT ISN'T REALLY AVAILABLE FOR ON GOING MOST OF THAT NINETEEN POINT ONE BILLION IS. A ONE TIME PAYMENT WERE MAKING TO SETTLE UP TO THE HIGHER GUARANTEE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE- BUT IN TERMS OF THE TOTAL THREE YEARS- THE NUMBERS YOU JUST MENTIONED ARE CORRECT TWO POINT SIX BILLION I'M GOING SIXTEEN POINT FIVE BILLION ONE TIME. OKAY AND WITH REGARD TO THE PERSON STIRS YOUR COMMENTS ON PERSONS STIRS- YOU BASICALLY MENTIONED THAT. INDIA NOT YEARS OUT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACTUALLY MAYBE EVEN THIS YEAR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE GOING IT IS- EXPERIENCE AND INCREASE THEIR PERSON STIRS COSTS YEAH WE'RE WE'RE PAYING IT DOWN WE HAVEN'T HAVE HOLES WE FORCED TO DO THAT DO WE NEED TO MAKE A STRONGER COMMITMENT TO DO THAT A LARGER COMMITMENT. I THINK OUR CONCERN IS THAT THE DEFERRALS THE PENSION COST INCREASES IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO C. MANAGEABLE TO US. WITH THAT THE COAL- THE THREE POINT 84% FOR LCS SELF. I THINK DISTRICTS CAN COVER ALL OF THOSE COST INCREASES THEY'RE FACING IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. BUT THE INCREASES IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE ARE. MUCH LARGER ONE POINT SIX BILLION THAT'S POTENTIALLY EVEN LARGER THAN THE COLA DISTRICTS MIGHT EXPECT RECEIVE NEXT YEAR. AND SO WE THINK YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT TO BE IN A POSITION WHERE IN A YEAR FROM NOW. DISTRICTS. ARE FACING VERY DIFFICULT INCREASE- THERE BUT HAVING TO MOVE. PEDAL AND SOME OF THE- OF MY IMPLEMENT. SO WE THINK USING SOME OF THE ONE TIME FUNDING THAT'S AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW IN THIS YEAR- COULD MAKE FOR A MUCH. EASIER A LESS DIFFICULT BUDGET CONVERSATION A YEAR FROM NOW. THIS IS A DO YOU HAVE A NUMBER. SURE SO ONE REASONABLE ONE KIND OF NUMBER TO PUT OUT THERE WOULD BE EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION- THAT WOULD BUY DOWN HALF OF THE ONE POINT SIX BILLION INCREASE IN COSTS AND WOULD CREATE MORE OF A FAST MOVING SUBJECT TO REVIEW FROM THIS YEAR- THROUGH THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. SO TO. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION. CORRECT AND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS ANOTHER EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION AND IS THAT IN A MILLION ON THE STREET SIDE OF THE PER SIDE OR WAS THAT A COMBINATION OF. THAT WOULD BE A COMBINATION THE END OF THE A COMBINATION OF BOTH MOST OF THAT IS RELATED TO STORIES JUST BECAUSE DISTRICTS HAVE MORE OF THEIR PAYROLL- FOR TEACHERS ON CERTIFICATED EMPLOYEES- AND THAT WOULD BE AT THE- THE NUMBERS THAT- DEPARTMENT FINANCE MENTIONED EARLIER WITH THE- I BELIEVE THAT WERE APPROVED IN THE TWENTY. TWENTY BUDGET PLAN- SO THAT EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION YOU ARE CORRECT WOULD BE ON TOP OF THAT RELEASED THE STATE HAS ALREADY PROVIDED. THE DIFFERENCE WOULD BE THAT IT WOULD BE A DISTRICTS WOULD RECEIVE IT IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. WHEREAS THE PREVIOUS ALLOCATION OF OVER TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. SO YOU'RE THERE YOU'RE THINKING ANOTHER EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION- DOES THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAVE A COMMENT ON THAT IS THERE. DO DO DO THEY HAVE A CONCERN THAT THE OUT YEARS THAT THE PERSON'S RESPONSE ARE GOING TO. BE A SIGNIFICANT BURDEN ON DISTRICTS AND- MAYBE WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT. ADDRESSING THAT UP FRONT. I SEE THIS YEAR. AGAIN ORDER TO FINANCE- MISTER CLINTON MEMBERS ARE PRECINCT- THE QUESTION AND CERTAINLY VALIDATE THINK WE- WE VALUE YOU KNOW THE ON GOING. COST RESEARCH I WANT TO SAY RESTRICTION BUT- THAT ELEAZAR FACING- STARS COURSE COST BEING ONE OF THE MANY AND WHILE WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL STANCE ON YOU KNOW THE L. A. O. SMITH IT'S NOT AN OFFICIAL PROPOSAL- IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE ARE AWARE OF AND- LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING PART OF THE CONVERSATION. OVER THE COMING MONTHS- I THINK FOR US IN TERMS OF THE PUBLISHING NINETY GUARANTEE I JUST WOULD REMIND FOLKS THAT DID PREVIOUS PAYMENTS ARE THE ONES MENTIONED FROM BEST TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT OF EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION THAT'S GOING OUT. ARE CURRENTLY IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO TALK THAT RATE IN THIS COMING YEAR- THAT WAS NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND AND SO THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE SOME CONVERSATION AROUND- APPROPRIATE USE THEIR OF WHETHER TO BE REAL GENERAL FUND OR PERHAPS JUST NINETY EIGHT- CERTAINLY NOT A- UPRIGHT JOB SCHOOL BUT- A BIG PART OF THE CONVERSATION I WOULD NEED TO BE CONSIDERED. OF I'LL LEAVE MY COMMENTS ABOUT. THANK YOU RIGHT NOW JUST FOR. THAT YOU OPEN THE CAR. RECOGNIZE THE ISSUE YOU. OKAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER AYE IT OUT AS- SO I HEAR AN REGULARLY FROM MY SPECIAL NEEDS PARENTS- AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS- WHO HAVE FELT THAT FOR SINCE THE LAST RECESSION- THEY HAVEN'T BEEN MADE WHOLE AND THE LACK OF RESOURCES ALLOCATED TO EXECUTE IT PEAS. BOMB IS DIFFICULT- FOR DISTRICTS AND FOR PARENTS- WHO ARE REALLY LOOKING FOR SUPPORT ON THIS IS ONLY GONNA BE EXACERBATED BY- THE LEARNING LAWSON REGRESSION THAT ARE SPECIAL NEEDS CHILDREN ARE FACING AT THIS VERY MOMENT. AND SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS ARE SIGNIFICANT COST FACTORS FOR SCHOOLS AND CONTRIBUTE TO BUDGET IMBALANCES INSTRUCTIONAL DEFICITS THE STATE SHOULD ENSURE CONTINUE PROGRESS IN ADDRESSING SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS PURSUING ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS AND BUILDING THE BASE GRANTS INCENTIVES INCREASE INCREASES PROVIDED- IN LAST YEAR SO MY QUESTIONS I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS. WHY DON'T COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION SPECIAL EDUCATION AND OTHER CATEGORICAL CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS GET THE BENEFIT OF THE COMPOUNDED THREE POINT 84% COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT OR COLA- PROPOSED BY LC A PATH WHY ARE WE DELAYING THE COLAC AT ALL. WHY NOT PROVIDE. TWO POINT 31% IN THE CURRENT YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND ONE POINT 5% IN THE BUDGET YEAR. FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AND I'VE ONE FOLLOW UP QUESTION AS WELL OR TO SEPARATE QUESTION. SURE AGAIN ERIN PUBLIC FINANCE APPRECIATE THE QUESTION- UP FOR THE MINISTRATION I THINK NOW WE HAVE THE UNENVIABLE TASK TASK AS SO DO ALL OF YOU ON THE SUBCOMMITTEE OF TRYING TO BALANCE THE BUDGET. AND WE FELT THAT WITH THE RESOURCES WE HAVE- GIVEN ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTIES I THINK- PAYING BACK THE PEARLS AS WELL- CERTAINLY COMPLICATES MATTERS EVEN MORE BECAUSE THE DAILY- POINTED OUT YOU HAVE THAT. THIS ONE TIME SURGE WHAT CAN FEEL LIKE A ONE TIME SURGERY OR BALLOON TO THE GUARANTEED- IS LARGELY TAKEN UP WITH JUST GETTING US BACK TO WHERE WE WERE. AND THAT WAS A HUGE PART OF A CALCULUS PROBLEM WE WERE CONTEMPLATING HOW TO APPLY THE COLA I WOULD NOTE- THAT COUNTY ALSO THE VEGETATION WE ARE ACTUALLY PROPOSING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TO. APPLY THAT COMPOUNDED COLA OF TO THEM AS WELL AT LEAST FOR THOSE THAT ARE THAT ARE FUNDED AT THEIR TARGET LEVEL SO I WOULD I WOULD MAKE THAT- THAT QUICK NOTE AND OTHER THAN THAT- WE FELT THAT THIS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET I PROPOSE MAKES- THE MOST KIND OF APPROPRIATE MIX OF BONDS WITH AND EVERYTHING ELSE BETWEEN ALL THE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT RECEIVE A COLA- DO MEDIA ACTION IN THE EARLY ACTION PROPOSALS- AND TO TRY TO HAVE THE BEST MIX OF ON GOING WELL BETWEEN ONE TIME AND ONGOING COSTS MOVING FORWARD SO THAT WAS REALLY. THE ONE THAT WE WERE TRYING TO LOOK THROUGH AND BY WE APPROACH IT- IN THE WAY THAT WE DID I WOULD NOTE THAT WE IT AT A PANEL WE'RE GONNA GET TO LATER TODAY WOULD BE TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT COMPENSATION FOR- SPECIAL AT SPECIAL EDUCATION A THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND WE'LL GET INTO. MORE DETAIL AROUND WHAT ENOUGH PROPOSAL BUT I DID WANT TO KNOW THAT THERE ARE TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES PROPOSE STILL MAKING I'M SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS AND SPECIAL EDUCATION YOU KNOW THROUGH OTHER WAYS IF NOT. THROUGH THE AT THE COMPOUND OF COURSE WAS THE QUICKLY. AND THAT'S A PERFECT- SEGUE INTO MY NEXT QUESTION WHICH IS- WHO WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION PROPOSED. FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION EARLY AND- OF THE SPECIAL EDUCATION EARLY INTERVENTION GRANT WILL BE LIMITED TO SCHOOL. DISTRICTS OR CHARTER SCHOOLS AND HOW OFFICES OF EDUCATION. THAT SERVED. AGE CHILDREN WITH EXCEPTION NEEDS. BE L. I AM NOT A 100% SURE ISN'T THAT IT'S NOT MY PERSONAL AREA OF EXPERTISE- AND I'M NOT SURE THAT ONE OF MY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE COLLEAGUES WAS ABLE TO BE ON THE CALL TODAY- IF THEY ARE THEY CAN SPEAK UP OR OR PERHAPS THE L. A. MAY- WHO WORKS ON THAT ISSUE MUST BE MIGHT BE ABLE TO TRY MAN. I APOLOGIZE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND LISTEN I WOULD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I COVER SPECIAL EDUCATION. SO FOR THAT THREE HUNDRED MILLION ELEAZAR- THAT. HOUSE PRESCHOOL AGE CHILDREN THAT ARE IDENTIFIED FOR. SPECIAL EDUCATION WILL RECEIVE A FUNDING AND THE REASON WHY WE SPECIFIED IT FOR ELLIE AS IS BECAUSE ONLY A HOP ON THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR SERVING THREE TO FIVE YEAR OLDS SO CHARTER SCHOOLS AND COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION WHO DO SERVE WILL NOT BE ELIGIBLE. CORRECT THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THOSE SERVICES DO Y. WITH A WE AS AND SO IF. THERE ARE- I GUESS PURCHASE DO NOT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BASED ON WHO IS RESPONSIBLE AND WHO WILL FUND THE SERVICES. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU THIS OF COURSE IS THE- THE PROBLEM AND THE EIGHT PIECE WE'RE GOING TO GO NEXT THE FEDERAL POLICE IN THE INTEREST OF TIME WE HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DALY GARDNER AVAILABLE- I THINK WE HAD A GOOD PRESENTATION FROM TWENTY THURMOND EARLIER IF WE HAVE. RATIONS FOR HER AND C. E. SHE'S AVAILABLE. BUT WE WENT TO- TO MOVE AHEAD NOW. TO THE NEXT SECOND SECTION WHICH I ABOUT- FEDERAL FUNDS FOR THE CURRENT YEAR IN BUDGET YEAR. START WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THEN L. L. THANK THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MELISSA AND WHAT APARTMENT OF FINANCE- I'LL JUST START OFF BY GIVING A QUICK OVERVIEW OF THE THOROUGHLY FUNDING PROVIDED IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT AND I'LL PASS IT OVER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO COPE WITH EXPENDITURES IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND HOW THE FUNDING HAS BEEN USED. THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ALLOCATED SIX POINT FOUR BILLION AND ONE TIME FEDERAL CORONAVIRUS AID RELIEF AND ECONOMIC SECURITY ACT COURTS CARE ACT FUNDING FOR K. TWELVE EDUCATION THIS INCLUDED FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION FROM THE CORONAVIRUS RELIEF FUND FIRST THEY ARE ASKED DURING A JAN FIFTY FIVE POINT TWO MILLION FROM THE GOVERNOR'S EMERGENCY EDUCATIONALLY FUND OR GEAR. AT ONE POINT SIX BILLION FROM THE ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EMERGENCY. RELIEF FUND ARE ASKED THEIR- THE PUBLIC BILLION IN SIERRA ALONG THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE TWO. FROM HERE ALONG WITH BY HUNDRED FORTY MILLION. IN OPPOSITION EIGHT COMBINE IT TOGETHER A TOTAL OF FIVE POINT THREE BILLION FOR LEARNING LOSS MITIGATION- THIS FUNDING WAS. TO ADDRESS VARIOUS ISSUES IN RESPONSE THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND ALLOW FOR BROAD USE OF EXPANDING LEARNING SUPPORTS INCREASING INSTRUCTIONAL TIME AS WELL AS DEVICES IN CONNECTIVE ITTY FOR DISTANCE LEARNING. AND INTEGRATED STUDENT SUPPORTS JEFF OTHER BARRIERS INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND ACCESS TO SCHOOL MEALS. I ALSO WANTED TO NOTE THAT THE SPENDING DEADLINE FOR THE FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION FOR THE C. R. AFT WAS ORIGINALLY DECEMBER THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY. BUT HAS BEEN EXTENDED WITH THE SECOND THOROUGHLY PACKAGE TO DECEMBER THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE PROPOSED A TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE RELATED TO THIS FUNDING TO EXTEND THE EXPENDITURE DEADLINE THROUGH MAY THIRTY FIRST. AND THIS WILL ALLOW AT LEAST A REPORT ANY UNSPENT BALANCE TO THE DEPARTMENT BY JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN ORDER TO ALLOW TIME TO RECOVER AND REALLOCATE FUNDS IF NEEDED. WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT ILLEGAL. THEIR ALLOCATION BUT HAVING COULD THIS LANGUAGE AT THE CONTINGENCY TO ENSURE THAT WE ACTUALLY. FIND SOMEONE THAT THE RETURN APPOINTMENT FUNDING TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IN ADDITION TO THE FUNDS PROVIDED FOR LEARNING LOSS MITIGATION ONE POINT SIX BILLION WORTH PROVIDER FROM AFTER FOR THE CORPORATE NOT PREVENTING PREPARING FOR AND RESPONDING TO COPE AT NINETEEN. WHICH INCLUDED A BROAD RANGE OF ALLOWABLE USES FROM ADDRESSING LEARNING LOSS TO THE PARENTS SCHOOL STORY OPENING. 90% OF THIS FUNDING OR ONE POINT FIVE BILLION WAS TO BE ALLOCATED ELLIE EIGHT BASED ON THE PROPORTION OF TOTAL ONE PART EIGHT ALLOCATION. WHICH IS BASED ON HOW. LOW INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN. THE REMAINING 10% OF THE FUNDING WAS PROVIDED FOR AN INCREASE THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR SCHOOL MEALS. A GRANT PROGRAM FOR IMPLEMENTING THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS MODEL AND FOR THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. FOR ALLOCATING AND OVERSEEING THE CARE THAT FUNDING. SIMILARLY THE MOST RECENT FEDERAL AID FROM THE CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE AND RELIEF SUPPLEMENTAL A COOPER APPROPRIATIONS ACT SIGNED INTO LAW LATE DECEMBER. PROVIDED SIX POINT SEVEN BILLION FROM THE ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY REALLY FIND WHICH WE CALL OUR ANSWER TO. THIS FUNDING WAS SIMILAR- REQUIREMENT THAT'S AFTER ONE IN THAT 90% OF THE FUNDING OR SIX BILLION A BE PROVIDED TO AT LEAST BASED ON THE PROPORTION STYLE ONE ALLOCATION. THE STATE DOES NOT HAVE DISCRETION ON HOW THE FUNDING IS ALLOCATED OR THE USE OF THE FUNDS THIS IS A SPECIFIED IN FEDERAL LAW. THE NEW FUNDING FACT. WILL BE PLAYING ON IN FOR THE BY THE L. A. L. BY WANT TO KNOW THAT WE RECEIVED APPROVAL FROM THE JAIL BE SPEECH PROCESS AND ALLOCATE THE SIX BILLION AS REQUIRED TO GO OUT TO AN EARLY AGE. THE THUNDER TELL ONE ALLOCATIONS. AND THIS FUNDING WILL ASSESS GOLDEN ADDRESSING IMMEDIATE NEEDS RELATED TO CONNECTIVITY MENTAL HEALTH NUTRITION AND OTHER AREAS TO HELP FACILITATE SCHOOL RE OPENING AND MITIGATE LEARNING LOST. THIS FUNDING IS ALSO AVAILABLE TO COVER COSTS DATING BACK TO MARCH. THIRTEEN TWENTY TWENTY AT THE BEGINNING THANK. AND LAST UGLY FIFTEEN. WAS PROVIDED THROUGH THE CHILD CARE DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT OR CDBG. PHYSICAL CHILD CARE COSTS RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC. THIS INCLUDED ALLOCATION FOR EMERGENCY VOUCHERS STIPENDS PAYMENTS FOR NON OPERATIONAL DAYS DUE TO HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERNS AND FAMILY FEE WAIVERS- IN LATE OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY AN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED TEN MILLION FROM THE C. R. S. WHAT MADE AVAILABLE TO OFFSET. THE CDBG CAR. AND THE FUNDING WILL REIMBURSE PROVIDERS FOR WAVE FAMILY FEES THROUGH JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND PROVIDED ADDITIONAL EMERGENCY. ALTERNATE. PAYMENT SPOT- I THINK WITH MIKE. I AM HAPPY TO HAVE BEEN ABLE THAT THE PANEL. BUT WILL NOW PASS WITH A TO THE DEPARTMENT OF. TO GO OVER THE EXPENSE RELATED THE RELIEF. FOR BY TODAY. OKAY. AS YOU HAVE JUST MENTIONED ELOISE RECEIVED FEDERAL FUNDING FOR A NUMBER OF KERR'S ACT SOURCES THESE INCLUDE THE FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION IN CORONAVIRUS REALLY FUNDS R. C. R. I. FUNDS AND THE STATE ALLOCATED THOSE TO EDUCATION WHICH WAS COMBINED WITH THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILLION IN FEDERAL GOVERNOR'S EMERGENCY EDUCATION REALLY CARE FUNDS AND FIVE HUNDRED FORTY MILLION IN GENERAL FUND TO CREATE A FIVE POINT THREE BILLION IN THE LEARNING LOSS MITIGATION FUNDING. THE L. ON MAP DOLLARS AS THEY WERE CALLED. I HAD TO BE USED FOR ACTIVITIES THAT DIRECTLY SUPPORT PEOPLE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AND MITIGATE LEARNING LAST RELATED TO CODE NINETEEN SCHOOL CLOSURES. IN ADDITION ELOISE RECEIVED ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IN ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL EMERGENCY RELIEF OR AFTER FUNDS. WHICH WERE ALLOCATED BASED ON THE ALLEY IS SERRA TITLE ONE. THE C. COMPLETED ITS THIRD REPORTING CYCLE IN JANUARY FOR THE FEDERAL FUNDS WHICH CAPTURED EXPENDITURES FROM MARCH FIRST. TO DECEMBER THIRTIETH OF TWENTY TWENTY. POLICE HAVE REPORTED HAVING EXPENDED OR OBLIGATED 99% OF C. R. FUNDS. AND SEE OUR FUNDS MAKE UP ABOUT 83% OF THE TOTAL FUNDING FOR ALUMASC. FURTHERMORE THE DATA REFLECTED THAT THE MAJORITY OF C. R. FUNDS ABOUT 59% WERE USED FOR DISTANCE LEARNING WHICH INCLUDED BUT ISN'T LIMITED TO. TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS SUCH AS INCREASING BROADBAND CAPACITY SOFTWARE PURCHASES THAT ENABLE DISTANCE LEARNING HARDWARE PURCHASES FOR STUDENTS AND THEIR TEACHERS SUCH AS LAPTOPS OR TABLETS. INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS NECESSARY FOR DISTANCE LEARNING STAFF TRAINING AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE QUALITY DISTANCE LEARNING. THERE IS A LARGE PORTION OF UNEXPECTED FUNDS IN DEAR ESTHER AND GENERAL FUND. THIS RANGES FROM A LOW OF 73% OF THE GENERAL FUND REMAINING TO A HIGH OF 89% OF YOUR REMAINING. HOWEVER I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS ALIGNS WITH CITY EASE EXPECTATIONS ALLEYS WERE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO SPEND THEIR C. R. FUND ALLOCATIONS FIRST GIVEN THAT THE ORIGINAL DEADLINES. FOR USING VR FUNDS WAS DECEMBER THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY FOR CONTEXT THE GENERAL FUND DOES NOT EXPIRE UNTIL JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND YOUR DOESN'T EXPIRE UNTIL SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY TWO. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF COLLECTING DATA FOR THE FIRST FEDERALLY REQUIRED ANNUAL REPORT FOR AFTER AND YOUR EXPENDITURES. AND THAT COVERS THE TIMELINE OF MARCH THIRTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY THREE SEPTEMBER THIRTY TWENTY TWENTY. BASED UPON THE FEDERAL FISCAL YEAR. WE WILL HAVE MORE DATA THIS YEAR ON THOSE FUNDS ONCE WE COMPLETE. THE REPORTING CYCLE IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS. THAT INCLUDES OUR COMMENTS ON THE FEDERAL FUNDS THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU- I HAVE. A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS HERE. ONE IS FOR THE L. A. ON ONE'S FOR CD FIRST LET'S WE HAVE CD RIGHT HERE- WHAT TO RAISE THE ISSUE ABOUT THE MONEY WE PUT IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET FOR THAT. POSITIVE TRIGGER FOR FUNDS FOR CHILD CARE WHICH WOULD GO TO ADDRESS. FAMILY FOR FAMILY FEES- INCREASE LOTS AND THE RATE STIPEND- THE PHARMACY ENDING IS THAT. FEDERAL MONEY IS COMING STE- SHORTLY. AND SO DO WE HAVE A DO WE HAVE A TIME WHEN GET THESE MONIES OUT THE DOOR. TO UTILIZE FOR OUR WITH. FOR OUR FRAGILE AND DESPERATELY NEEDED CHILD CARE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. ONE IN. EXACTLY THAT QUESTION IS FOR IS PRECEDED IT IF IT'S NOT IF WE DON'T HAVE ANY ANSWER I GUESS THE REQUEST FOR ME AND THE LEGISLATURE IS THAT WAS THE IT THE INDICATION THAT WE ADOPTED THIS IN JULY. IT'S OUR EXPECTATION THAT THE MONEY GETS OUT- RIGHT AWAY. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND GETTING THOSE DOLLARS OUT THE PROCESS HAS BEEN MORE DIFFICULT THAN ANTICIPATED AND WE WILL KEEP YOU UPDATED ON THAT TIMELINE. OKAY THANK YOU AND THEN THAT MIGHT NEXT QUESTION IS FOR THE L. A. O. FIRST OF ALL GOING BACK TO LAST SECTION I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA TO USE SOME OF THE ONE TIME MONEY TO DEAL WITH THAT PERSON STARES AS MR O'DONNELL WHAT WAS MENTIONING. CERTAINLY WILL BE ABLE TO HELP SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND SO IF WE DO GET THIS POTENTIAL THIRTEEN BILLION IN ADDITIONAL FEDERAL MONEY- WHAT COULD THOSE MONIES BE USED FOR I KNOW THAT. CONGRESS HASN'T PASSED IT IS STILL QUESTIONABLE THAT'S GONNA BE THAT THAT THE AMOUNT BUT IS SWIMMING THAT THERE IS. THIS NEXT ROUND OF- OF SUPPORT GOING OUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHAT COULD WHAT COULD WE EXPECT AS FAR AS THE UTILIZATION. OF THAT. THAT PART OF MONEY. THIS IS FOR LA UP. I HAVE A GROUP OF ALL OF THE OHIO CAN YOU HEAR ME YES. GREAT I'M JUST RESPONDING I THINK IT GENERAL. YOUR AVAILABLE TO LOOK ALONG THE EXTRA. BUT IF THE FUNDING LOOKS LIKE PREVIOUS ROUNDS OF FUNDING THE FIRST YEAR. EARLY SOURCES OF THAT COULD BE USED FOR. A VARIETY OF ACTIVITIES THAT ARE REALLY TO COMPANY. AND NOT ALLOW- DISTRICTS PROVIDES A FOR. ADDRESSING HUNTING LAWSUIT MECHANISM PARTY I THINK WE HAVE A SEEN ANY REALLY ANY TALK THAT. THE DEATH NOT ARE OVER EXPECTATIONS FOR ONE OF THE KEY. BUT BECAUSE I WAS OF MY COLLEAGUES PROPONENT EARLIER SPEAKING ABOUT THE SORT OF- ALL OF THE THINGS THE- ACTIONS CONCERT WITH YOUR- YOUR TO BRING. RIGHT NOW- OUT WHAT WHAT IT WOULD WAYS TO THE STATE BE ABLE TO YOU. THAT FUNDING ONE CONCERN I WAS THAT WE HAVE AND WE ARE- IN THE NEXT. YOU WILL MORE DO. COMMITTEE ON THE PROPOSALS BUT- I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WE CONCERNED A LITTLE BIT IS A THE AMENDED OF ONE FUNDING MIGHT BECOME TO SCHOOL. IT THIS COMING. BUT- THE SECOND ROW OF FEDERAL TO STATES- IS RECEIVING A GIFT SIX DOLLAR. GOVERNMENT IS FOR POINTS BILL DOLLARS ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR. ACADEMICS OF. BOTH OF THOSE ARE SOME WE NEED TO BE SPENT BY OUR BY PUTTING THAT OF THE- FISCAL YEAR I THINK. IN OF THE FEDERAL LANGUAGE LAWS SO SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWO AND THAT IS A LOT OF THIS ONE TIME FUNDING DISTRICTS MEET SUPPLY IF THEY ARE SPEND. THOSE DOLLARS COULD BE UTILIZED THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. IN THIS CASE I THINK YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE FACT THAT THESE ARE ALSO MANY HAVE TENDED TO HAVE A TEMPER SOME STATES OUTSIDE RECEIVED SOME DISCUSSION AROUND USE THE FUNDING AS OPPOSED TO JUST DISTURBING THE FUNDING TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS. WILL VARY FROM- WITH THE STATE HAS SOME FLEXIBILITY WITH TO DO WE THINK I HAVE A PART OF IT WILL BE TO DEPEND ON THE OVERALL ARM COMPLEMENT OF WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON IN THE REST OF YOUR BUDGET. FOR EXAMPLE SOME SOMEBODY YOU COULD CONSIDER IF OR OR WHERE THERE IS A GREAT BEST PLACES TO I'M INCREASE DISTRICTS TO PROVIDE MORE- SERVICES OR PROVIDE MORE SUPPORT FOR MANY LOS ONE EXAMPLE BE TRYING TO DO TO ENCOURAGE SCHOOL PROGRAM OR SUMMER ACTIVITIES- OPTION FOR EXAMPLE WE DO THINK SCHOOLS ARE COMING BACK WE THINK SOMETHING IS AMISS HERE SOME OF THE COMING BE USED TO COVER COSTS OF TESTING. THERE WILL BE. IF THE FUNDING COMES FROM THE- POSSIBILITY TUESDAY MAKES ON HOW TO DO THAT THE STATE ALSO WITHOUT TEMPERATURE PATTERSON YOU CAN BE USING IT. RATHER THAN FINDING ANYTHING IF DISTRICT- WE COULD STATE ARE WOULD HELP AND ALL ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE MORE PROMISING IS A. FULL OKAY. QUESTION MR O'DONNELL AND MAYBE THIS WAS DISCUSSED- BUT I DO GET THAT QUESTION A CAME INTO MY OFFICE ABOUT THE GEAR FUNDING OF THIS WOULD BE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION. DID YOU BROACH THAT YET. ARE YOU APPLYING FOR A THREE HUNDRED MILLION APPARENTLY. WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO CURRENTLY I THINK THE DEADLINE IS FEBRUARY EIGHTH- WE'RE STILL EVALUATING THE GUIDANCE THAT WAS RELEASED RECENTLY ON SECURE FUNDING AT THIS TIME. THANK IS THERE IS THERE A REASON YOU WOULD NOT APPLY FOR THE. I DON'T THINK THERE'S A REASON WHY WE WOULD NOT APPLY IT'S JUST THAT WE'RE STILL EVALUATING THE GUIDANCE- WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO MAKE DECISIONS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE. IN OUR CLINIC UPCOMING WEEKS ON THIS MONEY. AN IMMEDIATE ISSUE THANK YOU. OKAY FURTHER QUESTIONS FOR THIS PANEL ISSUE NUMBER.TWO PASSING AND WHAT WILL THAT PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE END OF THE HEARING I THANK YOU ISSUE NUMBER- ISSUE NUMBER THREE WE'RE GONNA THIS IS A MAJOR ONGOING PROP NINETY EIGHT PROPOSALS WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE L. A. AND THEN- CD E. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. HELLO AGAIN YES AND HER IDEA BARBARA FINANCE GOING TOGETHER- PRETTY OVERVIEW OF SEVERAL OF THE- SEVERAL OF THE- GOVERNOR'S. SPENDING THAT HELP YOU HAVE PROBABLY BEEN THE MOST NOTABLE WANTED TO BUILD AND WE'VE ALREADY TOUCHED ON UP TO THIS POINT SO I'LL KEEP MY COMMENTS. PRETTY GREAT- THE PROPOSED INCREASE FOR LTFS IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A COMPOUNDED COLA OF THREE POINT 84% REPRESENTING THAT THE SPENDING COLA IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AS WELL AS THE- ADDITIONAL CALL IN. TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO OF ONE POINT 5% OCT TWO BILLION UP AND- IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO OVER THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE ESTIMATED. LEVEL WITH COUNTY OFFICER THAT MADE IT TO RECEIVE. OPTIMALLY TEN MILLION DOLLARS OF THAT WELL. THIS BRINGS TOTAL FUNDING FOR THE HEALTH EFFECTS FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS TO APPROXIMATELY SIXTY FOUR POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. ALL THE OTHER KEIKO PROGRAMS NORMALLY RECEIVING A COLA WILL RECEIVE ONE- AND EQUAL TO ONE POINT 5% IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO- PRESENTING ONGOING INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY SIX. MILLION DOLLARS NOT FOR K. TWELVE PROGRAMS AGAIN- ADDITIONALLY AS I MENTIONED BRIEFLY EARLIER IN THE BUDGET DOES PROPOSE AN AUGMENTATION OF THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN ONGOING PROPOSITIONNINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. FOR THE SPECIAL EDUCATION EARLY INTERVENTION PRESCHOOLGRANT THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET ACT. THE PURPOSE OF THESE GRANTS TO INCREASE AVAILABILITY OF EVIDENCE BASED SERVICES THAT DIRECTLY SUPPORTS WILL GRADING INFANT TODDLERS. AND PRESCHOOLERS- WE ALSO HAVE SEVERAL OTHER SMALL PROPOSALS- BUT I WILL LET- MY COMMENT AND THERE AND I HAVE A COLLEAGUE ON THE LINE I WOULD BE HAPPY TO. SPEAK IN MORE DETAIL TO ANYTHING I'VE MENTIONED SO FAR OR- ANY OTHER PROPOSALS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE QUESTIONS ALL THANK YOU. GREAT I L. L. GOOD MORNING MR CHAMBERS MICHAEL PEREZ WITH THE NEXT YEAR ANALYSTS ALL THINGS JUST A FEW COMMENTS REGARDING THAT COLOR FOR LCS SEVEN KIND OF LOCAL PROGRAMS. FIRST WE THINK THERE FINANCES ESTIMATE OF A ONE POINT 5% COLDER FOR THE BUDGET YEAR GET REASONABLE. WITH STATE WILL HAVE THE FINAL NUMBER IN APRIL BUT WE DO NOT HAVE ANY TECHNICAL ISSUES THE ESTIMATED THAT EVERY BUDGET. I'M PROVIDING THE ADDITIONAL TWO POINT 3% 21% COLOR JUST UNTIL SEE IF THAT WAS NOT PROVIDING THE CURRENT YEAR. WE THINK TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE WANT TO PROVIDE MORE I'M GOING FUNDING TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS. BRING MY MONEY NOW SEE IF THAT WAS GOING TO DO THAT AS A BENEFITS ALL DISTRICTS. FIVE SISTERS FLEXIBILITY AND PROVIDES MORE FUNDING FOR DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS. UNLESS THING. TO THE EXTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN PROVIDING THE ADDITIONAL TWO POINT 31% COLLECT THE KIND OF. CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS TO RECEIVE DOUBLE EVERYTHING COLOR. WE WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT THIS WOULD COST ROUGHLY A HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION MORE THAN THE AMOUNT INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNMENT'S BUDGET. ON THE NET OUR COM BUT I HAVE A CHANCE ANY QUESTIONS THANK. AND DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. WHILE WE ARE PLEASED TO SEE THE THREE POINT EIGHT FOUR CALL IN LC AT THAT WOULD ASK ADMINISTRATION ALLEGED LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER PROVIDING THE LEVEL OF QUALITY PROGRAMS OUTSIDE OF IT CNS AT THE END YEAH I NOTED THERE WILL BE A TREMENDOUS INCREASE IN COSTS FOR SCHOOLS. TO SAFELY REOPEN IN THE- AND IT'S PROBABLY. ANY PROGRAMS OUTSIDE OF THE EVENT WOULD BENEFIT FROM THIS ADDITIONAL SUPPORT AS WELL. THAT CONCLUDES OUR COMMENTS AND WE ARE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS. ANY QUESTION. GREAT AND- HAVING NO QUESTIONS. GET A MOVE ON TO. GREAT AND I HAVE. TO THE SEVEN. SO I'M THE FISCAL CRISIS AND MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE TEAM THAT- F. C. M. A. T. IS CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC RESOURCE TO MONITOR AND GUIDE LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCY FISCAL HEALTH THIS HEARING WILL PROVIDE- THE FC MATC ANNUAL ADDRESS TO UPDATE THE ASSEMBLY ON THE STATE OF SCHOOL FISCAL HEALTH. SO ARE A SPEAKER ON THIS IS MICHAEL FINE OF FISCAL CRISIS MANAGEMENT ASSISTANT TEAM. SHE THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR- AND- MEMBERS ALONE. SURE TO BE WITH YOU THIS MORNING. GO AHEAD GO AHEAD MR FINE. THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIR BOB MY PLEASURE TO JOIN YOU THIS MORNING- I THINK- AS YOU ALL APPRECIATE THROUGH YOUR- THROUGH YOUR QUESTIONS IN THE PRESENTATIONS THAT ARE PRECEDED ME THAT THAT- IN THE CURRENT YEAR THERE'S- LESS OF A BUDGET CRISIS ARE AMONG OUR K. TWELVE SCHOOLS IN AND REALLY BECAUSE OF APPORTIONMENT DEFERRALS HAS BEEN MORE OF A FOCUS TO MANAGE OTHER CASH RESOURCES- AS OPPOSED TO THEIR BUDGETRESOURCES. ON ADDITIONALLY AS AS WELL FINANCING ON. THE L. A. O. ABILITY TO THERE'S BEEN TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF ONE TIME RESOURCES PROVIDED TO SCHOOLS AND SO THE BALLOT HAS BEEN CERTAINLY OCCUPIED A SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF THEIR FINANCIAL PLANNING AND CHALLENGES THAT THEY'VE EXPERIENCED THIS YEAR AND THAT IS TO EFFECTIVELY AND APPROPRIATELY SPEND THOSE DOLLARS- I WILL. ARE AS AS WE LOOK AT THE MOST RECENT FISCAL ACCOUNTABILITY ARE REPORTING- WE NOTE THAT AT FIRST INTERIM REPORT WHICH WAS A DECEMBER TIME FRAME ARE WE HAVE ONE DISTRICT AMONG THE STATE I'M SORRY I WANT TO BACK UP EARLIER IN THE YEAR WHEN COUNTY OFFICES HAVE THE TASK OF APPROVING A SCHOOL DISTRICT BUDGETS ARE FOR THE YEAR WE HAD ONE DISTRICT IN THE STATE THAT HAVE DISAPPROVED BUDGET OUT OF THE ELEVEN HUNDRED PLUS SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COUNTY OFFICES- AND SO THAT'S A- IT. IS SAKE OF THEIR THIRD CONSECUTIVE DISAPPROVAL- AND A DISTRICT THAT- OF BOTH THE COUNTY OFFICE AND OTHERS CONTINUE TO BE ENGAGED WITH. AT FIRST IN REPORTING OF THE MOST RECENT REPORTING PERIOD THAT WE'VE HAD WHICH WAS MID DECEMBER AND THIS IS ALL PLANETARY DATA BASED ON SELF CERTIFICATIONS. AND REVIEWS BY COUNTY OFFICES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IN ALL CASES OF NOT COMPLETED ALL OF THEIR REVIEWS YET THEY STILL HAVE SOME TIME. TO DO THAT I WE HAVE FIFTY ONE. DISTRICTS SELF CERTIFYING THIS QUALIFIED- FIFTY OF THOSE FIFTY ONE HAVE THREE OR MORE CONSECUTIVE QUALIFIED. OUR CERTIFICATIONS IN THREE. HAVE SEVEN OR MORE QUALIFIED SURE. THE QUALIFY CERTIFICATE THAT THEY ARE THAT THEY'RE CERTIFYING AMONG THIS GROUP- THIS FALL ARE THERE ARE NO DOWNGRADES BY COUNTY OFFICE OR BY C. D. E. F. MEANING THAT ALL THE DATA REPORTING AGAIN THIS SELF CERTIFY DATA WE ARE NOT AT THIS MOMENT INTO SEPARATING THAT ANY COUNTY OFFICE OR CVE WOULD BE DOWNGRADING THE DISTRICT FROM WHAT THEY SELF CERTIFIED. BUT SOME OF THOSE REVIEWS ARE STILL ONGOING WE HAVE THREE NEGATIVE DISTRICTSARE TO HAVE BEEN ONGOING- OF THOSE TOO- IS SET UP FOR LACTATION- THIS AT THE END OF THE CURRENT SCHOOL YEAR IN WILL BE ABSORBED BY A NEIGHBORING SCHOOL DISTRICT AND I OVERSAW ALL. OF THEIR THEIR NEGATIVE CERTIFICATION WE HAVE ONE NOW ARE A NATIVE CERTIFICATION IT'S A LARGE SCHOOL DISTRICT- BELKHIR OF UNIFIED- HAS- CAUGHT BOTH COUNTY OFFICE IN. THE REST OF US THAT MARIN THESE MATTERS A LITTLE BIT BY SURPRISE IN THAT THEY HAVE BEEN POSITIVE- HAVE A LONG HISTORY ACTUALLY OF A VERY STRONG FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT. OF THEIR OWN NEGATIVE CERTIFICATION WE BELIEVE IS VERY SHORT TERM- THEY ARE A DISTRICT THAT- IS FAIRLY CONSERVATIVE IN HOW THEY APPROACH THINGS IN THE- MOVED TO THE NEGATIVE CERTIFICATION WILLIAMS FULL DISCLOSURE. THAT. THEY SAW- JERRY IS J. COMING THEIR WAY ON THE THIRD YEAR OUT SO IT'S NOT IN IMMEDIATE ISSUE- THIS CURRENT YEAR OR NEXT YEAR BUT THE THIRD ISSUE A THIRTY YEAR OUT. AND WE ALREADY KNOW FROM WORK THAT WE'VE DONE WITH THE DISTRICT- IN THE DISK INPUT THE DISTRICT HAS GIVEN US THAT IF THEY WERE TO APPLY THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL COLA. OF THREE POINT EIGHT. NINE IN THE ONE NEXT YEAR. ARE IN IN THE SUBSEQUENT CALLS AFTER THAT- THAT THEY WILL BE- IN A POSITIVE CONDITION. IN SO LITTLE LESS CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR NEGATIVE CERTIFICATION- THAN OTHERS. CURRENTLY IN IT IN THIS YEAR WE HAVE FOR LACK OF GOING CONCERN DISTRICTS THESE ARE SIMILAR IN NATURE TO A NEGATIVE- CERTIFICATION BY DISTRICT BUT THEY DON'T GO HAND IN HAND WITH EITHER THE FIRST OR THE SECOND IN A REPORT. OTHERS FOR LACK OF GOING CONCERN DISTRICTS WERE ALL DESIGNATED BY THEIR COUNTY OFFICES EARLIER IN THE FALL ONE IS UR UNIFIED IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY BELLFLOWER UNIFIED IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY MONTEBELLO UNIFIED IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. NORMAL CITY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT IN BUTTE COUNTY WE ARE ENGAGED HAVE BEEN ENGAGED- WITH THREE OF THOSE FOUR ON DISTRICTS. AT THIS CURRENT TIME WE HAVE ONE COUNTY OFFICE THE SOFT CERTIFIED QUALIFIED ALL OTHERS OF CERTIFIED POSITIVE THAT ONE DISTRICT OR THAT ONE COUNTY OFFICE IS A SAN FRANCISCO. WELL I COUNTY OFFICE OF THAT AND BY THE WAY THEY ARE A SINGLE. SINGLE SINGLE COUNTY. USED SINGLE DISC ARE WITHIN THE K. SAN FRANCISCO. STAFFERS COUNTY OF IN BOTH ENTITIES CERTIFIED SELF CERTIFIED AS QUALIFIED. AS NOTED THAT USING A CHROME IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE JANUARY'S THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IN JANUARY WHILE WILL LIKELY CHANGE A NUMBER OF THE CERTIFICATIONS ALTHOUGH THE QUALIFIED CERTIFICATIONS THAT SECOND ROOM. AND HAVE A POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON AT LEAST PROBABLY TEN TO FIFTEEN OF THOSE DISTRICTS IN S. NOTED WITH ELK GROVE PROBABLY ONE. I WOULD POSITIVELY ON ONE NEGATIVE- CERTIFICATION. BY THE WAY IT ALL WILL HAVE A POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON ALL LEDS ARE SPECIFICALLY CHANGING A CERTIFICATION FROM FIRST GENERAL WELL I WOULD EXPECT THAT TO HAPPEN. S. SECOND INTERVIEW FOR THOSE NUMBERS I JUST GAVE YOU OVER THE LAST TWO AND A HALF YEARS- JEFF MATT. DIRECTLY ENGAGED WITH THIRTY TWO DISTRICTS. OVER OF FISCAL. STABILITY ISSUES SPECIFICALLY ARM. WHEN WE HAVE COMPLETED THOSE ENGAGEMENTS THAT 65% OF THOSE DISTRICTS WE DETERMINED THAT WERE AT HIGH RISK. OF INSTABILITY 26% OF MODERATE RISK AND 9% LOW RISK. ARE AMONG THOSE THIRTY TWO DISTRICTS WE HAVE FOUR ON THAT WERE JUST TRIGGERED- IN THE DECEMBER REPORTING IN SO WE'RE JUST STARTING TO ENGAGE. WITH THOSE FOUR DISTRICTS THOSE WOULD INCLUDE- DIXON INSISTS A UNIFIED IN SOLANO OF BILL GROSS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT LOST HILLS UNION ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT IN KERN. AND WEST CONTRA COSTA UNIFIED IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. THIRTY MY ATTENTION FROM THE ROUTINE AB TWELVE HUNDRED- CERTIFICATION AND REPORTING PROCESS THAT HAPPENS SO BASICALLY THREE TIMES YOUR BUDGET ADOPTION INTO EACH OF THE IN REPORTS IN THE LACK OF GOING CONCERN IN THE ONGOING DURING THE YEAR I TURNED MY ATTENTION NOW TO ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHTEEN FORTY. REVIEWS OF THIS IS SPECIFIC TO DISTRICTS INGLEWOOD UNIFIED IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND OAKLAND UNIFIED IN ALAMEDA. AT FIRST IN A ROOM ON EAGLE WOULD- REPORTED A POSITIVE CERTIFICATION AND THEY'RE PROJECTING NO CURRENT YEAR OR OUT YEAR DEFICIT FOR THE BUDGET YEAR. THIS WOULD BE THEIR THEIR FIRST NON DEFICIT REPORTING- WE CURRENTLY HAVE STAFF IN INGLEWOOD A VALUE WAITING THAT A REPORT IN THE METRICS THAT GO INTO THAT DATA ON A TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN PER WITHOUT OR NOT. FOR OAKLAND THEY REPORTED A FIRST INTERIM QUALIFIED REPORT THERE AMONG THE FIFTY ONE THAT WERE QUALIFIED. THEY ARE REPORTING A CURRENT YEAR DEFICIT FIRST AN ARM OF ROUGHLY THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS BUT THEY HAVE YET TO ACCOUNT FOR THE ROUGHLY SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS CITY BE EIGHTEEN FORTY IS PROVIDING THEM IN THE CURRENT YEAR. SO ONCE THE ACCOUNT FOR THAT- THAT THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT. IS SHOT- WOULD BE WIPED- CLEAN FOR THE CURRENT YEAR DO YOU STILL HAVE OUT HERE ON. THE CONCERN WHICH- ON DISTRICTS ARE ON THE HER- I MENTIONED- BOLT IN- I ALSO MET LOS HILLS. HOWEVER THAT WE THIS POINT INTENDED MONITOR AS OPPOSED TO ENGAGE WITH- SHANDON JOINT UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT- IN- MONTEREY COUNTY. WHICH SERVES MONTEREY AND SAN LUIS OBISPO- COMMITTEES ARE WE ARE ALSO MONITORING THEIR VERY SMALL DISTRICT BUT IF BEING. ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY SOME PROPERTY TAX ASSESSMENTS. DATA CLINTON WAS CONTRA UNIFIED- A LARGE DISTRICT ARE IN THE BAY AREA WHILE THE WE BELIEVE IT'S TIME TO FULLY ENGAGE WITH THEIR- WITH RESPECT TO SOLVENCY TRENDS THE TRENDS THAT WE SEE IMPACT INSOLVENCY. ARM WELL THE FIRST AND FOREMOST AS THE L. A. O. HAS DONE A GREAT JOB OF REPORTING PERIODICALLY OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF MONTHS RESERVES ARE GENERALLY HIGHER IN OUR K. TWELVE DISTRICTS RIGHT NOW THAN THEY WERE A DECADE AGO DURING pTHEY ENTERED. THE PANDEMIC PERIOD WITH HIGHER RESERVES AND THEY HAVE NOT BEEN NEARLY AS IMPACTED. AS YOUR OWN VERY FAMILIAR WITH DURING THE PANDEMIC AS WAS ONCE ARE. ARE PROJECTED TO BE. MULTI YEAR PROJECTIONS CAN DO SHOW SOME DEFICIT TRENDS. BUT AS NOTED THE GOVERNOR'S- ARE. BUDGET PROPOSAL WITH THE COMPOUNDED- TO YOUR COLA- WILL- CHANGED OUT FOR- PROBABLY 2230% OF THE QUALIFY DISTRICTS IN THE ONE NEGATIVE DISTRICT. S. FREQUENT CONDITION. AMONG THE QUALIFIED OUR CERTIFICATIONS IS DECLINING ENROLLMENT I'M MORE THAN 60% OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE DECLINING IN THEIR ENROLLMENT IN AS YOU APPRECIATE THAT HAS A- VERY DIRECT FINANCIAL IMPACT. ADDITIONALLY TRENDS INDICATE THAT SPECIAL ED COSTS- CONTINUE TO OUTPACE THE REVENUE GROWTH LEADING TO HIGHER LEVELS OF LOCAL CONTRIBUTIONS. AND THEN AS DISCUSSED MULTIPLE TIMES BY THE COMMITTEE THIS MORNING OUR EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION RATES TO CASTERS IN CALPERS WILL BE INCREASING AGAIN IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE- SPEAKING OF THAT TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE IS A CONCERN THAT WE HAVE- IT IS THE THIRD YEAR OUT IN THE PROJECTIONS. ARE CURRENTLY- BUT IT IS DEFINITELY ONE OF THE YEARS THAT WE ARE WATCHING CAREFULLY NOT ONLY IMPACTED BY THE CAL STIRS IN CALPERS EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION RATES BUT ALSO BY ENROLLMENT DECLINES BECAUSE OF THE SPECIAL. EIGHTY EIGHT CALLED HARMLESS IT WAS IN PLACE AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC PLUS THE TRADITIONAL EIGHTY A HOLD HARMLESS SO YOU IN PLACE IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO MOST DECLINING SCHOOL DISTRICTS WILL NOT FEEL THE IMPACT. OF THEIR DECLINE UNTIL TWO OF THEIR MULTI YEAR DECLINES IN TEL TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND SO THAT WILL NOT THAT FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE LOOKING OUT. IS GOING TO HAVE WELL. LARA IS SOMETHING WE WANT TO PAY CLOSER TO. AS ARE THE ONLY- JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO- SPOKE TO THE MAGNITUDE A ONE TIME DOLLARS- WHILE WELCOMED A CERTAINLY PROVIDE SOME. DIFFERENT CHALLENGES FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAN WHAT THEY'RE ACCUSTOMED TO DOING BY USING THOSE FUNDS THAT HAVE A LONG TERM IMPACT ON. OTHER STUDENTS ARE POSITIVE IMPACT ON THEIR STUDENTS. BEING SMART ABOUT HOW THOSE ARE USED TO DEAL WITH BOTH IMMEDIATE NEEDS AND LONG TERM. NEEDS AROUND STUDENT SAFETY STUDENT EMOTIONAL SOCIAL EMOTIONAL HEALTH- INSTANTLY STUDENTS LOS. ANY ANY LEARNING LOSS WILL BE IMPORTANT. SWITCHING ARE TOPICS- VERY QUICKLY- SPEAK TO EXTRAORDINARY AUDIT CIVIC MATT'S CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN OUR ACTIVITIES DOWN SLIGHTLY- FROM NORMAL WE CURRENTLY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR STAFF CONTINUING OF AN EXTRAORDINARY AUDIT REQUEST BY EIGHT I COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS TO LOOK AT THE INSPIRED CHARTER SCHOOLS NETWORK- WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT ALL OF THE CHARTERS- IN THAT NETWORK BUT ONLY EIGHT OF THEM HAT WERE IDENTIFIED BY. THE SPECIFIC COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS IN THE IMAC REQUEST A WERE WERE WELL UNDERWAY WITHOUT AUDIT PROCESS WE'RE STILL MONTHS AWAY FROM COMPLETION. ALSO SWITCHING GEARS WHILE THE FOCUS HERE IS ON K.

IS ALWAYS AN IMPORTANT TOPIC THAT. THIS HELPED OF OURS ALLOW FEW YEARS WE'VE HAD. OTHER FOR ISSUES AND NOW WE A WHOLE- YOU KNOW SO. ON ON TOP. SO I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT A FEW QUESTIONS AND SO. IT'S INTERESTING- YOU KNOW YOU UNITED SPOKE AT LENGTH ABOUT THE FISCAL HEALTH OF OUR DISTRICTS FOCUSING RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO MY SCHOOL DISTRICT AT SAC CITY. AND OF COURSE THERE IS THIS THERE IS DAHLE THING HAPPENING WE HAVE- THE DECLINING ENROLLMENT BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC BUT THE SAME TIME. WE'RE SEEING A SURGE IN ONE TIME REVENUE SO. IT'S YOU KNOW IT YOU KNOW- THE FALSE NEGATIVE IF YOU LOOK AT LIKE SOME TYPE OF A TEST- YOU KNOW- ANALYSIS AS FAR AS WHAT'S HAPPENING BUT IT'S REALLY KIND OF A STAY AS FAR AS WHAT THE PAIN IS. IS DOWN THE ROAD. A PLUS THE FACT THAT SOME OF THE SCHOOLS AREN'T DON'T HAVE TO UTILIZE MONEY FOR UTILITIES AND HEATING AND AIR AND- BOOKS AND SUPPLIES AND- FIELD TRIPS AND SO FOR TRANSPORTATION SO. IT JUST. REALLY HAS A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE HOW WE LOOK AT OUR SCHOOL SOMEONE IF YOU COULD KIND OF. LOOK AT THAT AND I WAS INTRIGUED YOU MENTIONED. ELK GROVE AS THE EXAMPLE AND THEY'VE BEEN ONE OF THOSE STABLE DISTRICTS IN OUR REGION HERE FOR A LONG TIME. SO WE GET A REPORT OF THEIR- NEGATIVE CERTIFICATION DUE TO THEIR ENROLLMENT LOSS AND THE IMPACT ON THEIR MULTI YEAR BUDGETS. MAYBE YOU COULD TALK ABOUT DISTRESSED DISTRICT AS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT THOUSAND WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. AND HOW THE STATE. SHOULD CONSIDER. THESE ENROLLMENT CLASS- AS WE AS WE LOOK AT THIS FROM A BUDGET PERSPECTIVE AS WELL AS A AS A POLICY PERSPECTIVE. SURE- THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION MISTER CHAIRED US SPECIFICALLY TO ELK GROVE BAND AND- NOW GROUPS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN MOST OF OUR THEIR DISTRICTS AND THEY'L GROW FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS HAS CONTINUED TO BE A GROWTH DISTRICT BY WAY OF ENROLLMENT THEY FORECASTED GROWTH AGAIN THIS YEAR IN FACT THEY GAVE- A LOT OF DATA IN INPUT TO THE CONVERSATIONS- THAT THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE LEGISLATURE HOW IN THE SUMMER IN SB EIGHT TWENTY N. ARE ALLOWING FOR SOME FUNDING FOR GROWTH DISTRICTS. IN THOSE IN THOSE AMENDMENTS TO SENATE BILL NINETY EIGHT FROM JUNE IN EIGHT TWENTY ARM AS IS IN IN- IN HELP GROSS PARTICULAR CASE ARE WHILE THEY PROJECTED. FOR- OF JUST OVER HUNDRED. THEY'VE ENDED UP WITH THE CLIP YEAR OVER YEAR DECLINE OF JUST OVER FOUR HUNDRED STUDENTS TO ALMOST A SEVEN HUNDRED STUDENT. WELCOME CHANGE FROM WHERE THEY ANTICIPATED THEY WOULD BE SO FROM A BUDGET STANDPOINT FROM AN EXPENDITURE STANDPOINT. THE BUDGET FOR THE HIGHER NUMBER OF STUDENTS SO THAT THEY WERE PREPARED TO SERVE THEM- KERR AND NOW. IS ONGOING AND THEY DON'T HAVE THESE ANSWERS YET YEAH. BUT AS TO THE REASONS WHY THEY CAN CERTAINLY HAVE THEY THEY CERTAINLY KNOW THE ANSWERS TO THE DAY ARE CAN LOOK AT THE DATA. FOR SOME ANSWERS ABOUT FOR ALL GROWTH IS IN TKA TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN AND KINDERGARTEN ARM THAT IS A TREND THAT WE ARE SEEING WHEN WE LOOK AT INDIVIDUAL DISTRICTS DATA WE DON'T HAVE STATEWIDE DATA YET BY GRADE. SPAN BUT IF YOU LOOK AT INDIVIDUAL DATE DISTRICTS AND WE ENGAGE WITH THEM. THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS- THAT'S A VERY FREQUENT- CITATION IS THAT A SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF THEIR- IN ROMAN DECLINE IS IN THOSE VERY EARLY GRADES. AS YOU APPRECIATE THAT CAN BE VERY FRIGHTENING BECAUSE IF THOSE STUDENTS ARE ACTUALLY GONE- THEN WE WASHED UP FOR THE NEXT THIRTEEN FOURTEEN YEARS- BERMAN ROMAN STANDPOINT. WHAT WE SUSPECT IS THAT THOSE PARTICULAR GRADES ARE MORE HEAVILY IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC THAN OTHER GRADES BECAUSE MANY PARENTS. CHOSE CHOSEN TO LEAD THEIR- KID- AT HOME AND NOT IN THEM IN DISTANCE LEARNING OR VIRTUAL EDUCATION AND SO WHAT WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR DISTRICT LIKE ALL GROVE AND FRANKLY ALL DISTRICTS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING A DECLINE IS TO ENGAGE WITH THEIR COMMUNITY ON A DEEPER BASIS TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THOSE KIDS ARE THEY NEED TO REACH OUT TO THOSE SO IF THEY HAVE PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS AND THOSE KIDS DIDN'T SHOW UP IN TKA- THIS PAST YEAR THEY'VE GOT THEY KNOW THOSE PARENTS ARE IN THOSE FAMILIES ARE THEY CAN REACH OUT TO. THEIR KINDERGARTEN KIDS IT DIDN'T SHOW UP BUT THEY WERE THERE IN TJ THIS PAST YEAR THEY KNOW WHO THEY ARE- THIS WILL BE IMPORTANT IN THEIR ANALYSIS GOING FORWARD BUT IT WILL ALSO BE IMPORTANT AND HOW THE- STRUCTURED THEIR INTERVENTIONS AN INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAM UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED EXPANDED TIME AND LEARNING- GRANT WITH RESPECTIVE YOU KNOW IT. ATTENTIONAL SUMMER SCHOOL OR SUMMER LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES I WANT TO BE VERY SPECIFIC IN SUPPORTING GOES BEYOND THOSE YOUNGER. KIDS- THIS ARTICLE LEVEL ARE IN DEVELOP A PRO LEADING INTO NEXT YEAR- SO. THAT WOULD BE USING ACRONIS OCCURS IN EXAMPLE BUT AGAIN I WOULD I WOULD APPLY THAT NO MATTER WHERE YOU'RE- WHERE YOU'RE DECLINING IS ACROSS THE STATE. IN WHETHER YOU'RE A THAT HAVE BEEN A DECLINING DISTRICT OR LIKE L. GROVER GROWING DISTRICT AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IS EXPERIENCING DECLINING- THAT CAREFUL ANALYSIS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL NEEDS TO BE DONE AS YOU PREPARE. YOUR PLANNING FOR IT- FOR THIS COMING SEASON. OKAY THANK YOU AT ONE MORE QUESTION. LAST YEAR IN THE IN THE PRIOR YEARS- WE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT FISCAL OVERSIGHT FOR DISTRICTS AS FAR AS THE THICK MAT PROCESS WE PUT SOME PIECES IN LAST YEAR'S- BUDGET IN THE BUDGET TRAILER BILLS. IN YOUR PERSPECTIVE ARE THERE OTHER OUTSTANDING ISSUES THAT THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- SO THIS THIS PAST YEAR OBVIOUSLY- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS OF THE BUDGET GOT INTERRUPTED BY THE PANDEMIC ARM AND SO WE DID PROPOSE- FOR THE TWENTY. TWENTY ONE BUDGET AND NUMBER OF A TRAILER BILL PROVISIONS- THAT- WE BELIEVED WOULD STRENGTHEN- FISCAL OVERSIGHT REALLY IN MOST CASES BY JUST DOING SOME FINE pCHANGING THE COR- A BODY OF LAW AND REGULATION YES- BUT SOME FINE TUNING THOSE THOSE DISCUSSIONS GOT STARTED IN JANUARY AND FEBRUARY- IT WITH THE RELEASE OF LAST YEAR'S JANUARY. OF GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- HOWEVER THEY THEY REALLY GOT- APPROPRIATELY FRANKLY PUT ON THE BACKBURNER. WHEN THE PANDEMIC YET AND SO WHAT YOU SAW IN. THE FINAL BUDGET ACT IS WHAT. HI AGREE ON WE- ANY IN DEPTH CONVERSATION- WE DID NOT BRING THOSE BACK UP BECAUSE WE'RE STILL IN THE PANDEMIC I WOULD HOPE THEY'LL BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO. BRING SOME OF THOSE BACK UP AND HAVE MORE IN DEPTH DISCUSSION- IN THE FUTURE BUT I PROBABLY WOULD GROUP THE PENDING ITEMS- IN THREE CATEGORIES. ONE IS- STRENGTHENING THE REPORTING OUT OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS AND- LABOR AGREEMENTS OR OR OR SHOWER AGREEMENTS IN BENEFIT AGREEMENTS AROUND. UNLESS UNREPRESENTED EMPLOYEES SHOULD NOT EVEN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING BUT ON REPRESENT IT WELL WE DID GET A GOOD CONVERSATION ON THAT STARTED LAST YEAR BUT BUT SIMPLY WITH THE PANDEMIC. INTERRUPTED FRUITFUL CONVERSATION THE SECOND CATEGORY- IS I THINK WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT- WHAT. WHAT THE BENEFIT IS SERVED BY OUR CURRENT PROVISIONS FOR FISCAL INDEPENDENCE IN FISCAL ACCOUNTABILITY. ARE YOU DO NOT SEE THAT IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL LAST JANUARY BECAUSE WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF WORKING ON DATA AND BACKGROUND FOR THAT. BUT THAT DISCUSSION I THINK OUR- NEEDS WITH SOME POINT TO SURFACE- IN AB AND HAVE A- IN DEPTH CONVERSATION ABOUT THOSE CATEGORIES OF DISTRICTS AND WHAT THE REAL BENEFIT IS TO THOSE- THOSE CLASSIFICATIONS. AND THEN THE THIRD WOULD BE- OPTIONS. ARE SPECIFICALLY IN MY MIND FOR THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT TO STRENGTHEN THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT'S ROLE WHEN THE DISTRICT IS NOT PROPERTIES- OUR CURRENT OVERSIGHT SYSTEM IS BUILT ON A PROMISE OF COOPERATION BETWEEN THE DISTRICT. AND THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT IT'S BUILT ON A PREMISE BACK IN YOU KNOW THE NINETEEN NINETIES WITH AB TWELVE HUNDRED- IT'S BUILT ON THIS PREMISE THAT. ARE BOTH PARTIES RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM- BAND THAT THEY WANT TO IMPROVE OVER THAT PROBLEM IN MAKE AND TAKE APPROPRIATE CORRECTIVE ACTION IN JOINTLY TOGETHER MOVE DOWN THE PATH. WHEN WE HAVE A DISTRICT THAT IS NOT ON BOARD AND WE HAVE A NUMBER OF THOSE EXAMPLES ARE THEN THEY'RE FISCAL RECOVERY IS DELAYED SIGNIFICANTLY- AND THE CHALLENGE FOR THE ARE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS I'M INCREASES EVEN MORE. AND SO LOOKING AT SOME OPTIONS FOR EXAMPLE WHEN THE DISTRICT DOES NOT- TIMELY- DOCTOR FISCAL STABILIZATION PLAN- FOR COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT TO POTENTIALLY A DOCTOR POTENTIALLY TO PREPARE. AND IMPOSE IT ON A DISTRICT ISN'T AS ONE EXAMPLE- SO THOSE WOULD BE THE THREE CATEGORIES I WOULD IDENTIFY SAWYER WITH RESPECT TO- POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE CONVERSATION. OKAY THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER VIA THAT S. THANK YOU I'M- STILL IN- ASSEMBLY DISTRICT THIRTY EIGHT ARE DISTRICTS ARE SMALLER AND WE HAVE BEEN- EXPERIENCING DECLINE ENROLLMENT THAT IS A CONCERN- AND I. ACTUALLY THINK THERE'S ADDITIONAL CONCERN WHEN IT COMES TO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ARE SEVEN THROUGH THE TWELVE- PARTICULARLY THIS YEAR AS IT'S NOW GOING ON A YEAR AS OF STUDENTS BEING OUT OF SCHOOL- PARTICULAR ATHLETES WHO ARE I AM AWARE ARE PLAYING OUT OF STATE. AND PARENTS ARE DECIDING THAT IF THEIR CHILDREN ARE REALLY GOING TO BE ENGAGED IN ATHLETICS AND ANOTHER STATE MAY BE- A PLACE FOR THEM TO DO THAT- THEY'RE DOING THAT NOW. WOULD IT BE YOUR RECOMMENDATION THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER YOU KNOW EXTENDING AN EXTENSION OF THE HOLD HARMLESS FOR THE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE YEAR. AND THEN MY SECOND QUESTION- WHAT WOULD BE THE ADVANTAGES OF ELEAZAR IF THE STATE REVERSED OR PAY DOWN THE DEFERRALS MORE QUICKLY. OKAY ON THE FIRST TOPIC OF THE I. OF THE SPECIAL EIGHTY A HOLD HARMLESS IN PLACE DUE TO THE PANDEMIC- IF TRULY WE SEE THE LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL AS THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT. IN HIS COMMENTS EARLIER THIS MORNING ALLUDED TO AND I THINK MANY OF US ARE VERY HOPEFUL FOR- AND WE'RE LEFT WITH SIMPLY EXCEPTIONS NEXT YEAR AS OPPOSED TO THE NORM. OF THE DISTANCE LEARNING IS THE EXCEPTION- THEN NOW I DON'T SEE ANY REASON TO CONTINUE AT A DISTRICTS THAT ARE DECLINING WILL REVERT BACK TO THEIR TRADITIONAL EIGHTY A HOLD HARMLESS IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS STILL BE FOR FUNDING PURPOSES BE USING AGAIN THERE NINETEEN TWENTY DATA AS THEY ARE DOING THIS YEAR BECAUSE IT. YOU'RE YOU'RE ENTITLED TO. BE FUNDED ON CURRENT THE HIGHER CURRENT YEAR OR PRIOR YEAR. IN NEXT IN THE BUDGET YEAR PRIOR YEAR WILL BE NINETEEN TWENTY BECAUSE WE'RE NOT CURRENTLY COLLECTING I'M AT ANY DATA IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SO THEY'LL HAVE A WHOLE ANOTHER YEAR IF YOU WILL AND HOLD HARMLESS- WITH RESPECT TO THEIR FUNDING BEFORE THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH THEIR DECLINE. ULTIMATELY DISTRICTS HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE DECLINE THEY HAVETO ADJUST- STAFFING IN PROGRAMS AND SERVICES A TO GO HAND IN HAND WITH THE SIZE OF THE OF THE POPULATION THEY'RE SERVING- AND SO- I BELIEVE THAT. THE HOLD HARMLESS FOR THE PANDEMIC- HAS SERVED EVERYBODY. HAS SERVED ITS PURPOSE INSTANCE SERVICE WHILE ON IN AND THEN MOVING FORWARD THAT WOULD GO BACK TO THE NORM- WITH RESPECT TO- OPTIONS FOR DISTRICTS IT MAY HAVE TO CLOSE ON A TEMPORARY BASIS- NEXT YEAR I THINK- JUST GOT HOME. OF DEPART FINANCE ADDRESS IN THE GOVERNOR'S- THEY ARE LOOKING TO. CREATE AN OPTION FOR THOSE DISTRICTS. TO AGAIN DEAL WITH THAT EXCEPTION MAY BE CREATED BY A LOCAL HEALTH- RESTRICTIONS OUR DECISION TO CLOSE- IN PERSON INSTRUCTION EITHER TEMPORARILY OR EVEN A LONGER TERM- IN THE NEXT YEAR AS PART OF THIS IS VERY FLUID. OBVIOUSLY AS AS WE SEE IMPROVEMENT- AND GO THROUGH THE SEARCHES AND I THINK EVERYBODY'S PROBABLY ON THE SAME PAGE IN THAT WE WE'VE GOT TO CONTINUE TO BE SOMEWHAT FLEXIBLE HERE. WITH RESPECT TO YOUR SECOND QUESTION ON DEFERRALS ON CASH DEFERRALS ARE- NOT A POPULAR THING IN THE FIELD WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND SMALLER SCHOOL DISTRICTS THIS YEAR WITH THE TWO- ARE. OUR KINSTON SOMETIMES BE HIT HARDER- BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY HAVE FEWER RESOURCES TO BALANCE- I THINK DISTRICTS OVERALL FOR THIS YEAR I GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE DEFERRALS IN THE COMPLEXITIES AROUND IT. ARE MANAGING OUT VERY WELL NOW THAT YES THEY HAVE YET TO BE A REALLY IMPACTED BECAUSE THEY GO INTO PLACE. IN JUST A COUPLE WEEKS IN FEBRUARY BUT THEY'VE ALL DONE THEY'RE PLANNING TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT- THEY DID THAT IN THE FALL. MOST OF MARIN TRAINS POOLS OF TAX AND REVENUE ANTICIPATION NOTE RULES IF YOU THEIR COUNTIES ARE THROUGH STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION THE STATE TREASURER DIFFERENT THAN THE GREAT RECESSION STEPPED UP AND CREATED A TRANSPORT. THIS YEAR AND WE- THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IN SUPPORT- MADE THAT AVAILABLE- TO ALL TYPES OF DISTRICTS AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER PROGRAM- THROUGH THE TREASURER'S OFFICE TO SUPPORT. CHARTER SCHOOLS- SHE CAN ADDRESSES BUT THERE WASN'T. PROCESS ALSO FOR DISTRICTS THAT DIDN'T LEAVE THEY CAN. MANAGE THEIR DEFERRALS AND WOULD MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA WELL THERE WAS AN APPLICATION PROCESS FOR. EXEMPTIONS FROM THE DEFERRALS AND CD IS BEEN THE ONE ON MANAGING OUT ALONG WITH FINANCING AND IN CAN SPEAK TO THAT. MY SENSE OVERALLS DISTRICTS HAVE MANAGED IT VERY VERY WELL- IS THERE A BENEFIT NOT TO HAVE DEFERRALS YES THERE'S A BENEFIT NOT TO HAVE DEFERRALS- I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION- CERTAINLY THEIR BUDGET PROPOSAL ACKNOWLEDGES THAT BY PAYING OFF. A SIGNIFICANT PIECE MORE THAN 70% OF THE EXISTING TO FOR ALSO- NOT THE PAIN I'M ALL OFF BUT THEN NOT CONTINUING- ONE SMALL ONE PIECE- THE DEFERRALS ARE COMPLICATED BY A SERIES. OF- A PROVISIONS ARE EVEN. THAN THEY WERE TO THE GREAT. WE NOW HAVE EDUCATION PROTECTION ACT WHICH CAME ABOUT AS WE EXITED THE GREAT RECESSION THAT OVERLAYS THIS AND COMPLICATES THINGS. ARM AND SO IT'S NOT BEEN THE EASIEST OF TOPICS CERTAINLY BUT AGAIN DISTRICTS OF MANAGE VERY WELL WE HAVE NO DISTRICTS THAT ARE IN DISTRESS RIGHT NOW. AS A RESULT OF- THE DEFERRALS. IN IN THE CURRENT YEAR. THANK YOU. J. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTIONS PROFESSING NONE THANK YOU MISTER FINE AND WE WILL CERTAINLY REVISIT THIS ISSUE- IN THE FUTURE.
