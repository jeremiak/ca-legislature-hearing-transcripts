YEAR- THIS IS BEEN AN ISSUE THAT

00:22:13.999 --> 00:22:15.934
I'VE BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH FOR

00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:18.603
MANY YEARS- WHEN I WAS AT THE

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:20.072
ALLEY FEDERATION OF LABOR I

00:22:20.138 --> 00:22:22.074
REMEMBER. THAT WE HAD TO GET

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:23.442
PAST THE PERCEPTION THAT ANY

00:22:23.508 --> 00:22:25.877
KIND OF A TAX CREDIT WAS ONLY

00:22:25.944 --> 00:22:28.113
GOING TO BENEFIT THE VERY

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:32.718
WEALTHY STUDIO- EXECUTIVES- AND

00:22:34.119 --> 00:22:35.954
PAINTED SO THERE WAS NO

00:22:36.021 --> 00:22:38.056
DESERVING OF ANY TAX CREDIT

00:22:38.123 --> 00:22:39.458
BECAUSE IT WAS ONLY GOING TO

00:22:39.524 --> 00:22:40.692
SERVE IT WAS ONLY GOING TO

00:22:40.759 --> 00:22:42.427
SUPPORT THESE VERY HANDFUL OF

00:22:42.494 --> 00:22:44.029
VERY WEALTHY PEOPLE WE HAD TO

00:22:44.096 --> 00:22:45.664
GET THROUGH THAT AND IT TOOK A

00:22:45.731 --> 00:22:47.833
LOT OF WORK TO SAY WAIT A

00:22:47.899 --> 00:22:48.834
MINUTE. THIS INDUSTRY IS MADE UP

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:50.602
OF FAR MORE WORKING MEN AND

00:22:50.669 --> 00:22:52.370
WOMEN BOTH IN FRONT OF CAMERA

00:22:52.437 --> 00:22:56.475

TAX CREDITS AND WE'RE MOVING

00:23:09.654 --> 00:23:13.391

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:26.938
HAPPENED TO ANY NOTICEABLE

00:23:27.005 --> 00:23:30.609

DEEPER COMMITMENT HASN'T

00:23:36.148 --> 00:23:38.650
RESULTED IN THE CHANGE THAT WE

SEVEN ONE IS- IT'S A- AN

00:30:17.582 --> 00:30:19.751
EXPANSION. OF A BILL THAT I

00:30:19.817 --> 00:30:21.953
AUTHORED AND WAS SIGNED INTO LAW

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:23.454
A FEW YEARS AGO SP FIVE NINETY

00:30:23.521 --> 00:30:26.958
TWO. ARE YOU MAY RECALL- THE S.

00:30:27.025 --> 00:30:28.459
P. FIVE EIGHT TWO. IT HAS TO DO

00:30:28.526 --> 00:30:30.695
WITH- HOW WE DEFINE OUR JURY

00:30:30.762 --> 00:30:33.798
POOL- THE PRACTICE IN CALIFORNIA

00:30:33.865 --> 00:30:34.933
AND BOTH STATE COURTS AND

00:30:34.999 --> 00:30:36.401
FEDERAL COURTS. HAVE BEEN THE

00:30:36.467 --> 00:30:38.770
SUMMONS JURY POOLS. USING THE

00:30:38.836 --> 00:30:45.577
VOTER ROLLS. AND DMV FILES. AND

00:30:45.643 --> 00:30:47.312
THAT IS- NOT EXPAND AND- IT

00:30:47.378 --> 00:30:49.414
LEAVES A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT OF

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:50.982
SOMEONE DOESN'T HAVE A DRIVER'S

00:30:51.049 --> 00:30:51.516
LICENSE. IF SOMEONE IS A

00:30:51.583 --> 00:30:53.351
REGISTERED TO VOTE THEY WON'T

00:30:53.418 --> 00:30:55.286
GET CALLED FOR JURY DUTY. AND SO

00:30:55.353 --> 00:30:57.455
IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC DIVERSITY

00:30:57.522 --> 00:31:00.458
AND RACIAL DIVRSITY- IT REALLY

00:31:00.525 --> 00:31:01.593
MEANS THAT WE HAVE JURY POOLS

00:31:01.659 --> 00:31:03.428
THAT ARE NOT. FULLY REFLECTIVE

00:31:03.494 --> 00:31:06.598
OF THE COMMUNITY- AND SO WHEN WE

00:31:06.664 --> 00:31:10.001
PASSED SB FIVE NINETY TWO- WE-

00:31:10.068 --> 00:31:12.570
AUTHORIZED. THE FRANCHISE TAX

00:31:12.637 --> 00:31:14.639
BOARD TO PROVIDE. TAXPAYER

00:31:14.706 --> 00:31:18.409
FILES- TO OUR COUNTY JURY

00:31:18.476 --> 00:31:20.878
COMMISSIONERS. SO THAT THE JURY

00:31:20.945 --> 00:31:22.580
POOL WILL INCLUDE THE ENTIRE

00:31:22.647 --> 00:31:24.716
TAXPAYER. DATABASE AND THAT'S

00:31:24.782 --> 00:31:26.718
HOW IT'S JUST A MUCH BROADER-

00:31:26.784 --> 00:31:28.253
CROSS SECTION OF THE COMMUNITY

00:31:28.319 --> 00:31:30.555
AND SO THAT WAS PASSED- AND

00:31:30.622 --> 00:31:33.424
THEN- LAST YEAR- THE FEDERAL

00:31:33.491 --> 00:31:35.827
COURTS CAME TO US AND SAID. WE

00:31:35.893 --> 00:31:37.562
WOULD LIKE TO ALSO EXPAND OUR

00:31:37.629 --> 00:31:39.931
JURY POOLS BYE ARE THE FRANCHISE

00:31:39.998 --> 00:31:40.932
TAX BOARD TELLS US THE

00:31:40.999 --> 00:31:43.167
LEGISLATION IS REQUIRED. TO

00:31:43.234 --> 00:31:45.670
AUTHORIZE THE TRANSFER OF THAT

00:31:45.737 --> 00:31:47.739
DATA TO THE FEDERAL COURTS. AND

00:31:47.805 --> 00:31:49.607
SO THAT'S ONE OF THE TWO SEVENTY

00:31:49.674 --> 00:31:52.610
ONE IS IT SIMPLY EXPANDS SP FIVE

00:31:52.677 --> 00:31:54.112
NINETY TWO ALSO AUTHORIZED

00:31:54.178 --> 00:31:55.847

PROTECTIVE MEASURES. I TO THE

00:32:02.854 --> 00:32:05.323
FEDERAL COURTS- AND SO THAT'S

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:07.859
THE GIST OF THIS- BILL LIKE IF

00:32:07.925 --> 00:32:08.693

THE PURPOSE OF DOING I SHOULD

TIME PERIOD. CAN SOMETIMES BE

00:44:08.045 --> 00:44:10.180
WEEKS OR EVEN MONTHS AND

00:44:10.247 --> 00:44:11.648
SOMETIMES THE SYSTEM IS

00:44:11.715 --> 00:44:13.884
INSTALLED IT SO SIMPLE SYSTEM-

00:44:13.951 --> 00:44:15.586
THAT WILL BE PERMITTED BUT IT

00:44:15.652 --> 00:44:17.221
CAN'T BE TURNED ON FOR AN

00:44:17.287 --> 00:44:19.523
EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME IT'S-

00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:21.525
IT'S REALLY UNNECESSARY. A

00:44:21.592 --> 00:44:25.562
BARRIER- SO AUTOMATED- SOLAR

00:44:25.629 --> 00:44:27.398
PERMITTING IT'S SOMETHING I HAVE

00:44:27.464 --> 00:44:28.999
BEEN PIONEERED FRANKLY BY THE

00:44:29.066 --> 00:44:30.000
UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF

00:44:30.067 --> 00:44:32.202

00:44:32.269 --> 00:44:34.505
HOME HAS BEEN A REAL CHAMPION

00:44:34.571 --> 00:44:37.107
FOR THIS- THE U. THE- DEPARTMENT

00:44:37.174 --> 00:44:40.077
OF ENERGY- CREATED. SOMETHING

00:44:40.144 --> 00:44:42.813
CALLED SOUL SOLAR OUT PLUS WHICH

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:44.948
WAS CREATED AS PART OF A VERY

00:44:45.015 --> 00:44:47.484
BROAD STAKEHOLDER PROCESS- AT

00:44:47.551 --> 00:44:49.453
THE FEDERAL LEVEL ON THIS BILL

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:51.188
DOESN'T REQUIRE THE USE THAT

00:44:51.255 --> 00:44:54.291
CITIES ADOPT. SOLAR APP PLUS YOU

00:44:54.358 --> 00:44:56.627
CAN BE AT ANY KIND OF SIMILAR-

00:44:56.693 --> 00:44:58.328
BUT WE EXPECTED SOLAR PLUS WILL

00:44:58.395 --> 00:45:01.131
BE THE ONE THAT CITIES WILL USE

00:45:01.198 --> 00:45:02.833
BECAUSE IT'S A- WAS. PUT

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:04.735
TOGETHER IN A VERY THOUGHTFUL-

00:45:04.802 --> 00:45:08.705
AND SOLID WAY- AND THIS WILL-

00:45:08.772 --> 00:45:11.308
ALLOW FOR FASTER A PERMITTING WE

00:45:11.375 --> 00:45:13.577
KNOW THE LOS ANGELES. AND SAN

00:45:13.644 --> 00:45:16.713

00:45:21.518 --> 00:45:24.721
ONLINE SOLAR PERMITTING- AND

00:45:24.788 --> 00:45:26.356
THIS WILL EXPAND THAT TO THE

00:45:26.423 --> 00:45:28.659
REST OF THE STATE EXEMPTING OUT

00:45:28.725 --> 00:45:34.698
THE SMALLER CITIES AND COUNTIES.

00:45:34.765 --> 00:45:35.966

FREE AND IT'S OPEN SOURCE IT'S

00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:47.578
EASY TO IMPLEMENT- THIS IS

00:45:47.644 --> 00:45:50.514
REALLY A VERY POSITIVE STEP IN

00:45:50.581 --> 00:45:52.716

KNOW. BUT CAN YOU TAKE A MINUTE

00:58:56.799 --> 00:58:58.568
AND IF IT TAKES LONGER TAN THAT

00:58:58.635 --> 00:59:00.236
WE CAN DO IT OFFLINE- JUST TO.

00:59:00.303 --> 00:59:03.072
EXPLAIN WHAT WOULD BE THE

00:59:03.139 --> 00:59:07.210
DIFFERENCE FOR THE ACTUAL.

00:59:07.277 --> 00:59:09.646
HOMEOWNER RESIDENT. THE CHANGE

00:59:09.712 --> 00:59:12.282
TO THIS. YEAH THE SYSTEM UP YOU

00:59:12.348 --> 00:59:14.250
KNOW AS CONSUMERS WHAT DO THEY

00:59:14.317 --> 00:59:17.420
LOOK FORWARD TO. PRICE CHANGES.

00:59:17.487 --> 00:59:20.223
IT'LL IT'LL JUST BE. FASTER THE

00:59:20.290 --> 00:59:23.293
RIGHT NOW. IF YOU- YOU'RE

00:59:23.359 --> 00:59:24.727
WORKING WITH A VENDOR AND THEY

00:59:24.794 --> 00:59:28.264
COME AND INSTALL. THE SYSTEM-

00:59:28.331 --> 00:59:31.901
THE- RIGHT NOW THEY CAN TAKE. IF

00:59:31.968 --> 00:59:32.468
YOU'RE LUCKY IT TAKES A FEW

00:59:32.535 --> 00:59:36.239
DAYS. TO GET A PERMIT- IT MIGHT

00:59:36.306 --> 00:59:37.373
TAKE WEEKS OR MONTHS

00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:39.208
UNFORTUNATELY I MEAN YOU'RE JUST

00:59:39.275 --> 00:59:40.410
SITTING THERE WITH THE SYSTEM

00:59:40.476 --> 00:59:41.744
BUT YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED. TO TURN

00:59:41.811 --> 00:59:43.346
ON IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING FOR THE

00:59:43.413 --> 00:59:47.550
CONSUMER- AND IN FACT- THE WE

00:59:47.617 --> 00:59:49.485
WERE TOLD THAT. THERE ARE PEOPLE

00:59:49.552 --> 00:59:51.321
WHO WALKED AWAY FROM EVEN DOING

00:59:51.387 --> 00:59:53.056
IT IF THEY THINK IT'S GOING TO

00:59:53.122 --> 00:59:54.057
TAKE A LONG TIME. THIS WILL

00:59:54.123 --> 00:59:56.192
ALLOW IT TO BE ESSENTIALLY

00:59:56.259 --> 00:59:56.926
INSTANTANEOUS UNLESS THERE'S

00:59:56.993 --> 00:59:59.929
SOME ISSUE. THAT CAUSES THE CITY

00:59:59.996 --> 01:00:02.398
TO WANT TO DO AN INSPECTION- BUT

01:00:02.465 --> 01:00:03.933
IT WILL BE EFFECTIVELY

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.802
INSTANTANEOUS ARE ON THE SAME

01:00:05.868 --> 01:00:07.503
DAY. SO FOR THE CONSUMER TO MUCH

01:00:07.570 --> 01:00:10.340
THAT'S FRUSTRATING- PROCESS-

01:00:10.406 --> 01:00:11.407
THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES LIKE

01:00:11.474 --> 01:00:15.945
SOMETIMES GETTING THE- PG&amp;E

01:00:16.012 --> 01:00:18.815
ERROR I CAN ONLY SPEAK TO PG&amp;E.

01:00:18.881 --> 01:00:21.985
TO ACTUALLY- DO THE

01:00:22.051 --> 01:00:23.853
INTERCONNECTION CAN ALSO TAKE.

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.755
TIME BUT THIS IS THIS WILL

01:00:25.822 --> 01:00:27.557
REMOVE TIME FOR THE PERMITTING

01:00:27.623 --> 01:00:29.492
AND ELIMINATE THAT. SOURCE OF

01:00:29.559 --> 01:00:30.994
THE LION FRUSTRATION FOR THE

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:35.098
SIMPLE. SOLAR AND STORAGE

01:00:35.164 --> 01:00:36.099
SYSTEMS. RIGHT AND THAT'S

01:00:36.165 --> 01:00:37.600
BECAUSE THEY WILL BE. RIGHT

01:00:37.667 --> 01:00:40.069
REMOTELY OR BY VIDEOTAPE THERE

01:00:40.136 --> 01:00:41.904
IS NO EVIDENCE THAT A HOMEOWNER

01:00:41.971 --> 01:00:44.640
WILL BE. YOU CAN JUST EXPLAIN

01:00:44.707 --> 01:00:46.642
THAT PART OF THE S. OF A THE

01:00:46.709 --> 01:00:47.377
CONTRACTOR WOULD BE THE ONE TO

01:00:47.443 --> 01:00:50.179
DO IT WOULD BE ABLE TO GO TEST

01:00:50.246 --> 01:00:52.215
ONLINE AND JUST GET THE PERMIT-

01:00:52.281 --> 01:00:54.717
ONLINE- INSTEAD OF HAVING TO

01:00:54.784 --> 01:00:56.185
AUTOMATICALLY GO THROUGH THE

01:00:56.252 --> 01:00:57.687
PROCESS AGAIN CITY STILL HAVE

01:00:57.754 --> 01:00:59.589
SOME FLEXIBILITY. IF THEY THINK

01:00:59.655 --> 01:01:01.257
THAT THERE'S A PARTICULAR ISSUE

01:01:01.324 --> 01:01:02.658
THAT THEY NEED TO DO AN

01:01:02.725 --> 01:01:04.560
INSPECTION- THEY CAN DO THAT BUT

01:01:04.627 --> 01:01:06.429
IT WON'T BE AN AUTOMATIC THING

01:01:06.496 --> 01:01:09.766
THAT HAPPENS- EVERY EVERY TIME.

01:01:09.832 --> 01:01:11.534
AND ANY OTHER AND THE RATIONALE

01:01:11.601 --> 01:01:12.502
IS THAT FOR THE VERY SIMPLE

01:01:12.568 --> 01:01:14.470
SYSTEMS IT'S SORT OF LIKE IF YOU

01:01:14.537 --> 01:01:16.939
THINK BACK IN THE DAY WHEN

01:01:17.006 --> 01:01:18.875
DISHWASHERS WERE FIRST INVENTED-

01:01:18.941 --> 01:01:19.742
THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOME

01:01:19.809 --> 01:01:21.244
QUESTIONS ABOUT OKAY WE'RE WE'RE

01:01:21.310 --> 01:01:22.678
WE'RE PLUGGING IT INTO THE

01:01:22.745 --> 01:01:23.780
PLUMBING SYSTEM OR WHAT I CREATE

01:01:23.846 --> 01:01:25.848
ISSUES. OBVIOUSLY TODAY WE DON'T

01:01:25.915 --> 01:01:27.784
REQUIRE EVEN REQUIRE A PERMIT

01:01:27.850 --> 01:01:29.318
FOR DOING THAT SO OVER TIME FOR

01:01:29.385 --> 01:01:31.421
THE SIMPLE SYSTEMS IT'S SUCH A

01:01:31.487 --> 01:01:33.689
ROUTINE THING AND IS THERE

01:01:33.756 --> 01:01:35.058
AREN'T SORT OF UNEXPECTED

01:01:35.124 --> 01:01:36.893
SURPRISES TYPICALLY PRETTY

01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:40.763
LIMITED ONLY TO RESIDENTIAL

01:01:40.830 --> 01:01:43.299
SMALL SIMPLE SYSTEM- AND SO THE

01:01:43.366 --> 01:01:44.801
AUTOMATION AUTOMATED PROGRAM

01:01:44.867 --> 01:01:49.739
