WHICH WOULD INCREASED ACCESS TO PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES BY PROVIDING AN INCENTIVE FOR CURRENTLY LICENSED MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL TO GAIN MEDICAL TRAINING USING EXISTING TRAINING PROGRAMS. FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO SAY I AM HAPPY TO TAKE THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS REMOVING THE COLLECTION OF FEES FROM MPS MPAS FOR THE LOAN PROGRAM. CALIFORNIA IS FACING IT'S A SHORTAGE OF MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHO CAN WRITE ASK ACCESS TO PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES THERE SIMPLY AREN'T ENOUGH GRADUATING PSYCHIATRISTS TO MEET CURRENT DEMAND. ONE IN FOUR PSYCHIATRISTS POSITIONS IN COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM STATEWIDE OUR BACON AT ANY ONE TIME. SOME ESTIMATES IT INDICATE THAT DURING ANY ONE YEAR TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE POPULATION WILL BENEFIT FROM MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND FIFTY PERCENT OF OUR POPULATION OVER THEIR LIFETIME WILL REQUIRE THE SERVICES IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE ADDRESS THE CURRENT AND FUTURE NEEDS OF OUR CITIZENS PARTICULARLY IN UNDERSERVED AREA. AB TWENTY ONE FORTY THREE AMEND STATUTES FOR EXISTING STATE PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE MENTAL HEALTH LOAN ASSUMPTION PROGRAM. TO ALLOW DUAL STATUS TRAINEES MEETING CERTAIN CRITERIA TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENTS IF THEY'RE WILLING TO WORK IN UNDERSERVED OR RURAL COMMUNITIES. INCREASING OPPORTUNITIES FOR LICENSED PSYCHOTHERAPIST TO GAIL TO GAIN DUAL LICENSURE AS PHYSICIANS ASSISTANTS OR PSYCHIATRIC MENTAL HEALTH NURSE PRACTITIONERS WILL HELP. FIND AND TO ATTRACT THEM TO UNDERSERVED AND RURAL COMMUNITIES GROWING THE PSYCHIATRIC WORKFORCE WILL EXPAND PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES TO THOSE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS.

MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE RENTAL HAGER FOR THE PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION ON WE ARE THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL.

OUR ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT OF THEM ARE APPROACHING THE AGE OF SIXTY FIVE ON SOME OF THE OBVIOUS SOLUTIONS. TO CREATING MORE PSYCHIATRIC ACCESS ARE REALLY NOT FEASIBLE AT THIS POINT IN TIME FOR INSTANCE CREATING NEW RESIDENCY TRAINING PROGRAMS. THEY ARE DEPENDENT IN LARGE PART ON. FEDERAL MONIES. BUT THERE ARE LONG TIME CONSUMING PROCESS IS SET UP SO WE WHAT WE HAVE HERE TODAY IS IS. I AN ALTERNATIVE WHICH I THINK IS AN INNOVATIVE. IDEA OF THE LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAMS IN OUR STATE ARE TESTED. PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT AND NURSE PRACTITIONER PROGRAMS ARE WELL ESTABLISHED. THE MENTAL HEALTH LOAN PROFESSIONAL REPAYMENT PROGRAM ALREADY EXISTS SO WE ARE TAKING WHAT WE HOPE IS THE NEXT STEP TOWARDS OFFERING OPPORTUNITIES FOR. ALREADY CURRENTLY TRAINED PSYCHOTHERAPIST TO DENVER GONE BECOME. MEDICALLY TRAINED IN IN EITHER OF THOSE TWO DISCIPLINES IT'S MORE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH IT'S IT'S A.

OF ATTACKS ON CAMPUSES WHETHER THEY BE OF GUN RELATED THE STUDENTS DON'T ALWAYS HAVE A PLACE TO A REALLY GET THE NECESSARY INTERACTION THAT THEY NEED THIS WOULD BE A BEGINNING% OF. LOOKING FOR GUIDELINES FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS TO START TO INTRODUCE TELL AUTHORITY AND THIS ACTUALLY CAME OUT OF ME VISITING A SPEECH THERAPY CLINIC IN ORANGE COUNTY WHERE THEY ARE NOW SERVICE SEEN ON MANY MANY UNDERSERVED YOUTH AT A COMMUNITY CENTER USING TELESAT P.. SO WITH THAT OF OUR HOPE IS THAT WE WILL BEGIN TO LAY THE FOUNDATION SO THAT OUR STUDENTS WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO TELESERYE P.. PARTICULARLY WITH COUNSELORS AND SO FORTH AND.

AND MY OFFICE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF ON THE CRITERIA THAT WAS OUTLINED. IN YOUR OTHER SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS AS WE MOVE FORWARD. AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE ON CHAIR AND HIS STAFF FOR YOUR CONTINUE TO. ON THE SUBJECT. CALIFORNIA HAS NEARLY EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE WITH CRIMINAL RECORDS. THAT'S ONE IN EVERY FIVE CALIFORNIANS. IT'S BEEN SHOWN THAT THE BEST MEASURE AGAINST RECIDIVISM. IS GETTING A JOB TO SUPPORT YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILY. APPROXIMATELY THIRTY PERCENT OF ALL JOBS IN OUR STATE REQUIRE AN OCCUPATIONAL LICENSE. MANY OF THESE LICENSES HAVE REGULATIONS WHICH IMMEDIATELY DISQUALIFY ANYONE WITH A PRIOR CONVICTION REGARDLESS OF THE DEGREE HOW LONG AGO THE CONVICTION WAS. OR ANY TYPE OF REHABILITATION COMPLETED. AB TUNE TWO TWO NINE THREE ADDRESSES THE LICENSING FOR EMTS AND SIX TO PROVIDE THE PATH REMEMBER OVER CONSERVATION CAMPS. WERE APPROXIMATELY FORTY FIVE HUNDRED INMATES AROUND THE STATE HAVE VOLUNTEERED TO BATTLE FIRES. TO DO WORK TOWARDS THEIR CONSERVATION. AND DO WORK TOWARD SCHOOL OUR CONSERVATION EFFORTS BUT ARE BARRED FROM GETTING THE REQUIRED LICENSES TO USE THE SKILLS THEY HAVE LEARNED. ONCE THEY'RE NO LONGER INCARCERATED. IN A NORMAL YEAR THESE INMATES MAKE UP. UP TO THIRTY PERCENT OF OUR FOREST FIRE FIGHTERS. THEY CONTRIBUTE OVER THREE MILLION HOURS RESPONDING TO FIRES. AND OVER SEVEN. IN OVER SEVEN BILLION HOURS AND COMMUNITY SERVICE PROJECTS. THEY ALSO HELP A STATE SAVE APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. THAT'S IN A NORMAL YEAR. LAST YEAR WAS THE LARGEST AND MOST DEVASTATING FIRE SEASON IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY. AND THEIR EFFORTS ALL AROUND THE STATE WERE NO LESS EXTRAORDINARY. I'M SORRY TO SAY THAT CONSERVATION CAMP MEMBERS HAVE EVEN PERISHED. DURING TRAINING AND ON THE FRONT LINES BATTLING OR FIRES FOR OUR STATE. THESE PEOPLE OUR TRUSTED AND SKILLED ENOUGH TO RISK THEIR LIVES WHILE THEY'RE INCARCERATED. WHEN RELEASED THEY WANT TO USE THE SKILLS THEY'VE LEARNED AND PUT THEM TOWARDS EARNING A LIVING AND CONTRIBUTING TO THEIR COMMUNITIES. UNFORTUNATELY OUR STATE'S RESTRICTIVE LICENSING SYSTEM IN THIS AREA BARS THEM FROM DOING SO. AB TWENTY TWO NINETY THREE SIX TO REMEDY. IT'S TO REMEDY THAT WHILE ALSO LOOKED TAKING PUBLIC SAFETY INTO ACCOUNT. HERE TO SPEAK ON THE BILL ARE JAIL. MYRICK FROM THE EAST BAY COMMUNITY LAW CENTER AND DEVOTED TO LAYER FROM LEGAL SERVICES FOR PRISONERS WITH CHILDREN. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M EVER TELL AIR WITH LEGAL SERVICES FOR PRISONERS WITH CHILDREN. AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER JUST SAID THIRTY PERCENT OF OUR CURRENT FOREST FIRES ARE CURRENTLY INCARCERATED THAT'S FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE AND THEY GET PAID TWO DOLLARS AN HOUR. CDC ARE SELECT TO THOSE PEOPLE CAN BE AND AUTOMATICALLY EXCLUDES PEOPLE WITH CONVICTIONS FOR SEX OFFENSES ARSONOR ESCAPE. FIREFIGHTING IS A GROWTH INDUSTRY FOR WHICH WE HAVE SEEN THE STARK NEED FOR PEOPLE IN THESE ROLES LAST YEAR ACROSS THE STATE WITH COMMUNITIES AND HOMES DECIMATED THE PRISON SYSTEM IS TRAINING PEOPLE TO FILL THESE POSITIONS BUT THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS INCLUDING CAL FIRE REQUIRE EMT CERTIFICATION FOR THESE JOBS. OUR COMMUNITIES DESERVE SKILLED AND EXPERIENCED FIREFIGHTERS OUR SOCIETY DESERVES A LICENSING PROCESS THAT DOESN'T DUPLICATE AND REINFORCE UNINTENTIONAL RACIAL DISCRIMINATION. AND THESE MEN AND WOMEN ARE DOING THIS WORK WELL INCARCERATED THEY DESERVE A FAIR CHANCE FOR A LIVING WAGE TO DO THIS AFTER INCARCERATION. I WANT OF FURTHER EMPHASIZED THAT THIS BILL GOES BEYOND JUST THE CONSERVATION CAMP WORKERS. EIGHT MILLION CALIFORNIANS HAVE CONVICTION HISTORIES. THIS BUT AND THAT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN THE FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE IN THESE CAMPS THIS BILL PROVIDES A PATH FOR PEOPLE WITH NON CONVICTIONS. SO ARRESTS. WITH CONVICTIONS THAT WERE NOT SERIOUS ENOUGH TO WARRANT PRISON TIME AND THEREFORE WEREN'T ELIGIBLE FOR CONSERVATION CAMP BECAUSE IT'S A CDC OUR PROGRAM. AND ALSO FOR THOSE WITH CERTAIN CONVICTIONS THAT HAVE SHOWN REHABILITATION AND ARE OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES. AND THANK YOU MY NAME IS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JAIL MYRICK AND I'M WITH THE EAST BAY CAN BE LAW CENTER AND JUST BRIEFLY I WANT TO READ PORTIONS OF TWO LETTERS WE WORK WITH CLIENTS ON A REGULAR BASIS WERE TRYING TO GET THEIR LIVES BACK ON TRACK AND. WANT TO READ FROM TWO OF THEM ONE. I'M WRITING THIS LETTER TO INFORM YOU WHO I AM A AND HOW BEING CONVICTED OF A FELONY OVER TWENTY SEVEN YEARS AGO IS STILL AFFECTING ME. I'VE BEEN A FIREFIGHTER IN THE BAY AREA FOR TWENTY YEARS NOW AND THE LONGSHOREMEN THE PAST FIVE. I HAVE TWO WONDERFUL CAREERS IN A LOVING FAMILY WITH A WIFE AND FOUR SONS RANGING FROM NINE TO TWENTY FOUR YEARS OF AGE. I WANT TO PROMOTE TO THE POSITION OF FIRE INVESTIGATOR WITHIN MY DEPARTMENT BUT IN ORDER TO DO SO I HAVE TO TAKE A FIRE ARMS AND LAWS. OF OF OVER REST CLASS I HAD TO SUBMIT MY FINGERPRINTS TO THE DOJ AND OF COURSE I WAS UNABLE TO BE CLEARED FOR THE CLASSES BECAUSE OF MY CONVICTION. BECAUSE I CANNOT TAKE THESE CLASSES I CANNOT BE PROMOTED DESPITE HAVING WORKED HARD AS A FIREFIGHTER FOR TWENTY YEARS I HAVE BEEN A LAW ABIDING CITIZEN THAT GOES TO WORK EVERY DAY WITH TWO JOBS. RAISING A FAMILY OF FOUR SCIENCE AND THIS HAS COME BACK TO HURT ME TIME AND AGAIN AND THEN THE OTHER LETTERS FROM A WOMAN. WELL WHO IS ACTUALLY A FIREFIGHT BUT REGISTER AS EMT IN ANOTHER STATE IN AUGUST THE TWENTY FOURTEEN I WAS CONVICTED OF ONE MISDEMEANOR DUE TO BEING AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP. A FEW MONTHS. POST CONVICTION I WAS ABLE TO END THE RELATIONSHIP AND START ANEW I STARTED AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIAN PROGRAM AFTER DECIDING THAT I WANT TO BE A FIRST RESPONDER WITH ASPIRATIONS OF BEING A FIREFIGHTER PARAMEDIC. I MOVED TO NEW YORK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN FOR A CHANGE OF ENVIRONMENT DURING THAT TIME I OBTAINED MY NATIONAL REGISTRY.

THAT I'M CURRENTLY UNABLE TO PROBE PROGRESS CAREER WISE. BOTH AT AMERICAN MEDICAL RESPONSE AND IN THE FIRE SERVICE THANK YOU. YOU VERY MUCH DESERVED OTHER OTHERS IN SUPPORT. BETTER THAN I WITH THE EAST BAY COMMUNITY LAW CENTER ON BEHALF OF A COALITION OF OVER FIFTEEN ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ABOVE SUBMITTED LETTERS OF SUPPORT. WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTY THIRTY NINE. HELLO SABRINA CHRIS SAID HE WITH ALL OF US ARE NONE IN STRONG SUPPORT. ERICA TING GOING ON BEHALF OF POLICY LINK IN THE ALLIANCE FOR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR IN STRONG SUPPORT THINK YOU. THREE ONE IN OPPOSITION. WHEN IT WAS RECORDED A LOT LIKE TO SUPPORT ALSO ON THE SPEAKING MAYBE HALF A LOT OF THE FANS THAT ARE OUT THERE THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU SORRY. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MY NAME IS DAVID MAGNETO AND THE ADMINISTRATOR FOR THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICE AGENCY. AND ON BEHALF OF THE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICE. ADMINISTRATORS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA I AM CURRENTLY A PARAMEDIC LICENSE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS AND AN EMT THAT'S BEEN CENTER CERTIFIED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OF FOR OVER THIRTY FIVE YEARS TWELVE THIRTY OF THOSE YEARS BEING WITH THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL. I'M FOR BEFORE YOU TODAY. TO EXPRESS M. SACKS CONCERN REGARDING THIS BILL. FIRST WE BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT TO HOLD PARAMEDICS AND IAN TV'S. TO A HIGHER STANDARD. DUE TO THE NATURE OF THEIR WORK. MANY OF THEIR PATIENTS ARE. ELDERLY. THE INFIRM AND ALONE. THEY HAVE VERY LIMITED DIRECT SUPERVISION Y. THERE ON A CALL. IN THEIR ACCESS TO PATIENTS IDENTITIES VALUABLES AND MEDICATIONS ARE WIDELY OPEN. LOCAL EMS AGENCIES ROUTINELY CERTIFY. EMTS WITH PAST CONVICTIONS. THESE INDIVIDUALS MUST COMPLETE THEIR PROBATION. ALL COURT ORDERED REQUIREMENTS. AND CURRENTLY LOCAL YOU MISS AGENCIES USE THE EXISTING LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK TO GUIDE US IN OUR DECISION MAKING. PROCESS. WHEN A PERSON IS REHABILITATED. SUCH AS IF THEY'VE COMPLETED ALL THE COURT REQUIREMENTS. THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR CERTIFICATION. BOTH THEIR ONLY A FEW EXCEPTIONS SUCH AS PENAL CODE TO NINETY CONVICTIONS AND MURDER. AND CURRENTLY AS AN ADMINISTRATOR I HAVE FOUR NEW. EMT APPLIQUE APPLICANTS. WHO HAVE SUBMITTED ALL THEIR DOCUMENTS? I'M WAITING FOR THE COURT DOCUMENTS. TO REVIEW ALL OF THEM HAVING PRIOR CONVICTIONS. AND SHOWING TRENDS. BUT AS I LOOK AT THEIR BASIC PEOPLE WORK RIGHT NOW. EVEN WITH THEIR CONVICTIONS THOSE FOUR WILL PROBABLY MOVE ON TO BE CERTIFIED. WE UNDERSTAND AND EMPATHIZE WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER RACES OBJECTIVES HOWEVER. WE'D LIKE TO NOTE THAT FIREFIGHTERS ARE NOT CURRENTLY. REQUIRED BY STATUTE TO HOLD AN EMT OR PARAMEDIC CREDENTIAL. BASIC PUBLIC SAFETY FOR STATE IS ALL THAT IS REQUIRED. UNDER STATUTE. AND CAL FIRE WIDELY WILDLAND FIREFIGHTERS ARE TRAINED. TO BE FOR STATE CERTIFY STANDARD. AB TWO TWENTY TWO NINETY THREE RESTRICTS THE CONSIDERATIONS OF VIOLATIONS TO ONLY. DODD ON DUTY BEHAVIOR HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THAT THESE OFF DUTY VIOLATIONS THAT WORK CONSIDERATIONS SUCH AS DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE. DIRECTLY RELATES TO ONE'S ABILITY TO QUARK. A FORM SAFELY WHILE ON DUTY. IT'S THEIR PERSONAL CHOICES AND A BILLY TO BE RESPONSIBLE. FOR ONE'S ACTIONS THAT NEED TO BE MONITORED AND HELD ACCOUNTABLE ONCE THEY ARE CERTIFIED AS A. EMT. THE OLD THE EMS ADMINISTRATORS ARE WILLING TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND EMS AUTHORITY TO EVALUATE OUR EXISTING REGULATIONS AND GUIDELINES TO DETERMINE. THE UNNECESSARY BOUNDARIES TO LICENSE YOUR THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON STRUCTURE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S KEVIN BACK HIM A BOARD CERTIFIED EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN I'M ALSO THE CURRENT PRESIDENT. OF EMERGENCY MEDICAL DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS REPRESENTING THE THIRTY THREE MEDICAL DIRECTORS. THAT OVER THAT STATUTORY AUTHORITY OVER THE FIFTY COUNTIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I'VE SERVED AS MEDICAL DIRECTOR ONE THE CMS AGENCIES FOR TEN YEARS. AND ARE I I CAN KNOWLEDGE THE AUTHOR'S INTENT TO EXPAND THAT CALIFORNIA'S FIREFIGHTING CAPACITY. HOWEVER I'M GONNA TAKE A BRIEF MOMENT SPUN YOU WHY THIS BILL IS BOTH UNNECESSARY WINE FORTUNATELY I HAVE TO OPPOSE IT. THE LOCAL A MESS AGENCIES WITH THEIR MEDICAL DIRECTORS ARE CHARGED. THE CERTIFICATION OF EMTS THIS IS AN AWESOME RESPONSIBILITY. BECAUSE THESE MEN AND WOMEN RESPONDED TO THE HOMES OF OUR OF OUR LOVED ONES IN OUR FAMILY MEMBERS IN ADDITION IS MR BANG KNOW POINTED OUT. ARE INVALID INFIRMED AND PEOPLE AT RISK. THIS IS THERE'S VERY LITTLE DIRECT SUPERVISION OF THE CMT'S WALL THEY'RE CHARGING THEIR EMERGENCY CARE I'D EMPHASIZE DIRECT THAT'S VISUAL ON SITE. WHICH IS WHY LOCAL AMOS AGENCIES HOLD THESE INDIVIDUALS TO A VERY HIGH STANDARD. WE HAVE CURRENT EXISTING OPERATIONAL LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK THAT THE MESSAGES HE'S WORK UNDER TO GUIDE US. WHEN A PERSON HAS PARTY LEGAL TROUBLES. AND WE DO CERTIFY THOSE. ARE WITH PRIOR CONVICTIONS SO LONG AS IF COMPLETED OF THEIR COURT IMPOSED REQUIREMENTS HOWEVER WE ALSO RIGHTFULLY DISALLOW CERTIFICATION FOR THOSE WHO'VE COMMITTED SEVERE PENALTIES LA SUCH AS. A PENAL CODE TO NINETY IN VIOLENT FELONIES IN ADDITION AB TWENTY TWO NINETY THREE A ROADS ARE EXISTING AUTHORITY TO MAINTAIN ACCOUNTABILITY. FOR THOSE WHO HAVE PARDEE YOU WISE OFF DUTY ACTS AND THE MONITOR FITNESS TO PERFORM LIFE SAVING TASKS. FIREFIGHTERS PARTICULARLY CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY FIREFIGHTERS ARE ALLOWED TO BUT ARE NOT REQUIRED TO BECOME EMTS. CDF WILDLAND FIREFIGHTERS ARE TRAINED BASIC FIRST DAY. WHILE I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE AUTHOR FOR THE INTENT HERE IS MEDICAL DIRECTOR THAT SIGNED THE CERTIFICATION CARDS OF HUNDREDS OF EMTS AND PARAMEDICS. I'M CERTAIN WE CAN ACCOMPLISH HER OBJECTIVE BY WORKING WITH THE STATE EMS OF FORTY AND STAKEHOLDERS UNDER CURRENT LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK. TO EVALUATE AND ADDRESS ANY UNNECESSARY BARRIERS TO LICENSE FROM CERTIFICATION FOR THESE REASONS THE EMERGENCY MEDICAL DIRECTOR ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. MUST REGRETFULLY OPPOSE AB TWENTY TWO NINETY THREE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. BUT AND OTHER OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NO MORE BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MISTER FLOOR. AND THE PACIFIC THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS UP AROUND. I DO APOLOGIZE I'M HAVE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THIS PARTICULAR BILL. THERE WAS A LOT SAID TODAY ABOUT HELLFIRE IN THE FIRE SERVICE IN. AS YOU MAY KNOW THAT THAT IS ACTUALLY WHERE I COME FROM I WORK FOR CAL FIRE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. AND IN THEIR MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS IT'S EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD. PERIOD. SO THERE IS NO THIS CORRELATION BETWEEN THE FIRE SERVICE AND AN EMT TRAINING. SPACES RELEASED A CAL FIRE IS NOT EXACTLY ACCURATE. BECAUSE IT IN THEIR OWN HOME. QUALIFICATIONS SO JUST MAKE A NOTE OF THAT BECAUSE I AM CONCERNED. AS AN EMT MYSELF AS A PARENT I WENT TO PARAMEDIC SCHOOL IN SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY. WHEN WE GO INTO THESE HOMES. THESE ARE TYPICALLY THE WORST DAY THAT THESE PEOPLE NEVER HAD. AND WHEN WE WALK INTO THEM THEY HAVE TO HAVE THE UTMOST TRUST. THAT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE THERE TO HELP THEM. ARE NOT GONNA DO SOMETHING. TO HARM THEM AND I FEEL BAD TO SPEAK OPPOSITION THIS BILL BECAUSE I'VE WORKED WITH EX CONS AT CAL FIRE. TWO THE GUYS I WORK WITH THE SAN ANDREAS WERE FORMALLY INCARCERATED AND SOME OF THE BEST GUYS I'VE EVER MET MY LIFE. AND THEY'RE INCREDIBLE HUMAN BEINGS AND THEY HAVE A PATH TO BECOME INCREDIBLE AND SUCCESSFUL MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY WHICH IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. BUT IF YOU'RE A RECOVERING ALCOHOLIC YOU PROBABLY SHOULD WORK IN A BAR. IF YOUR BANK ROBBER YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T WORK AT A BANK TELLER. AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THESE FOLKS WHEN WE TAKE A PATIENT IN THE HOSPITAL WE LOADED UP INTO THE BACK OF AN AMBULANCE. A LOT OF TIMES THEY DON'T HAVE A MEDALIST. BUT THIS HAS A BAG OF PILLS. AND WE TAKE HIM TO THE ER WITH US AND THE DOCTOR GOES THROUGH THOSE OR THE MEDIC ON THE CALL SO WE CAN TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THIS PATIENT WHAT SUMMERS PREVIOUS MEDICAL HISTORY MAY BE. IT BE VERY VERY EASY TO TEMPT SOMEBODY INTO. SOME OF THE BEHAVIOR THAT THEY MAY OR MAY NOT OF HAD IN THE PAST AND OTHERS MY CONCERN IS. WE WANT TO HELP THESE FOLKS OUT WE WANT TO GET THEM TO BECOME SUCCESSFUL. BUT IF THEY HAVE ISSUES WITH SOME OF THESE THINGS IN THE PAST TO TEMPT THEM WITH THAT I THINK IT COULD BE PROBLEMATIC FOR THEIR OWN SUCCESS. SAYS MY CONCERN TO THIS BILL AYE I DO FILLED APOLOGIZE FOR BEING IN OPPOSITION TO IT. BUT I DO THINK THE EM THE FIREFIGHTER CALIFORNIA I'M. ANALOGY IS IS IS A GREAT ANALOGY BECAUSE THAT'S A VERY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM. BUT IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY RELATE TO THE INDIAN THE LICENSURE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL THANK YOU VERSION. TO BIGELOW. CHYNA. KIND OF PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE. LIKE MY COLLEAGUE NEXT TO ME OVER HERE HE GIVES A REALLY GOOD SET OF REASONS. KIND OF PUTTING IT IN PERSPECTIVE FOR YOU. MY LICENSE NUMBER IS ZERO ZERO ZERO THREE. ONE AND TWO NO LONGER WITH US TODAY SO MY HISTORY IN THE. INDUSTRY IS PRETTY LENGTHY. AND I UNDERSTAND. HOW IT WORKS VERY WELL AND AND AND LIKE? THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER JUST SAID. CALIPARI IF YOU'RE EIGHTEEN AND BREATHING THEY WELCOME YOU AND. YOU DON'T NEED US TO BE AN EMT TO WORK THERE JUST HAVE THE BASIC SKILLS IT IN BASIC FIRST AID. I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE HERE. AND AS THE ART DIRECTOR SPOKE A MOMENT AGO. THE REAL THRUSTING ISSUE FOR US IS. THE SANCTITY OF CONFIDENCE WITH THE PATIENT. CRITICAL THAT WE HAVE. THAT KIND OF CONFIDENCE IN THE PEOPLE WHO WERE TREATING. AS OUTLINED PREVIOUSLY WITH THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER SO I'M NOT QUITE SURE. HOW THIS RESOLVES ANY OF THAT? AND IN ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE FOLKS WHO OUTSIDE THE WORK PARAMETER SOMETIMES STUMBLE IN LIVE. AND ARE UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO PRACTICE. OR UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO PRACTICE BECAUSE THEY'VE. MAYBE THEY'VE GOT A DUI ARREST FOR SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T ALLOW THEM TO HIM OUTSIDE THE WORKPLACE. TO CONTINUE ON FORTY CONTINUE RECEIVING. ARE CONTINUING AT. SUCH AS BOTH OF US. I MEAN FOR MAY I EVER FOR THREE MONTHS OUT OF EVERY YEAR EVERY THURSDAY I GO HOME. AND TAKE A A CONTINUING ED COURSE JUST KEEP CURRENT. AND SO I KIND OF. PERPLEXED HERE SOME ASK YOU TRY TO HELP GIVE US SOME. GUIDANCE AND AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT YOU'RE REALLY TRYING TO ACHIEVE HERE BECAUSE IF I LOOK AT THE FIRST PART OF THIS PRESENTATION. IT DOESN'T CORRELATE WITH THIS LATTER PART. DEALING WITH THE BROADER SCOPE OF FIRE. WHAT HE REALLY TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH? THERE ARE THE TWO AREAS AND IN A MOMENT I'LL LET OUR. ORDER THEM. SPEAKERS ALSO ADDRESS IT. WELL LOOK AT EMTS JUST IN GENERAL WERE LOOKING FIREFIGHTERS. AND IF WE DO KNOW THAT. THIRTY PERCENT AND THIS IS JUST ONE OF THE ONE OF THE GROUPS THAT NEEDS TO HAVE A LICENSE. THIRTY PERCENT OF ALL JOBS REQUIRE LICENSE AND IT IT'S BEEN SAID BY SOME OF THE SPEAKERS THAT. YOU YOU PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES. YOU MAKE A MISTAKE AND YOU HAVE A SOMETIMES AND YOU COMPLETE YOUR SENTENCE FOR SOME OF THEM IT BECOMES A LIFE SENTENCE. ESPECIALLY FOR PARTICULAR JOBS. WE HAVE SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDED ANY VIOLENT CRIME. FROM FROM THE BILL. SO WHEN ANY CONCERN THAT A PERSON WOULD HAVE HAVING AN EMT OR HAVING A FIREFIGHTER COME INTO THEIR HOME I THINK IT WOULD BE THE SAME CONCERN NO MATTER WHAT. YOU HAVING STRANGER WALK INTO YOUR INTO YOUR INTO YOUR HOME. BUT CLEARLY. BEFORE YOU GET THE EMPTY BEFORE YOU GET THE JOB YOU HAVE TO BE THAT IT. YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS YOU'RE NOT GUARANTEED A JOB JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE AN EMT LICENSE. STILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS AND THE EMPLOYER WILL STILL JUST DECIDE WHO THEY'RE GOING TO EMPLOY. BUT MR CHURKIN I HAVE. CAN I HAVE FOR THE RESPONSE PROVIDED. YEAH I WOULD ALSO ADD A IN RESPONSE TO A NUMBER OF THE QUESTIONS BOMBER RELATING TO ISSUES THAT ARE NOT IN THIS BILL OF AND WHAT I MEAN IS. EARLY ON THE MEMBER MENTIONED THAT. SHE'S AGREEING TO THE A DISCIPLINARY QUESTION SO QUESTIONS IN TERMS OF WHETHER SOMEONE FALLS OFF THE WAGON OR GETS INTO TROUBLE WHILE THEY'RE ON THE JOB WOULD NOT BE. BE AN ISSUE HERE BECAUSE THIS THE DISCIPLINARY PIECE WOULD REMAIN THE SAME. ALSO AS THE MEMBER STATED WERE NOT INCLUDING. VIOLENT. FELONS UNDER SIX SIX POINTS THAT. SIX SIX SEVEN POINT FIVE WERE ALSO NOT. CHANGING WITH. DRAMATICALLY THERE ARE. TO NINETY SO. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT SORT OF SEXUAL OFFENSES THAT WOULDN'T BE IMPACTED HERE AS WELL ARM AND THEN THE OTHER THING THAT I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE UNDERSTAND. IS THAT. WHILE THERE MAY NOT BE A REQUIREMENT FOR FIREFIGHTERS AT CAL FIRE TO HAVE THE MT. MOST. OF THE LOCAL AGENCIES. DO REQUIRE IT AND AS A PRACTICAL MATTER IF YOU DON'T HAVE EMT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A VERY HARD TIME GETTING A JOB AS A FIREFIGHTER AND THAT'S OUR EXPERIENCE AND SO. THOSE ISSUES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO TO SOFT. YEAH I WOULD JUST. MAYBE MY EXPERIENCE IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE I WORK WITH A MOMENT DAILY BASIS. AND I SEE WHO GETS HIRED WHO DOESN'T GET HIRED. BUTTON TO MY KNOWLEDGE. ANYWAY IT SHOWS UP AND FILLED OUT THE APPLICATION. FOR THE MOST PART. GETS ACCEPTED. RIGHT AWAY AND THEN THEY'RE PUT INTO THROUGH A FORTY HOUR BASIC. OPS. PROGRAM WHERE THEY GET THEIR BASIC TRAINING. AND FROM THERE THEY CAN EXPAND GO ON TO THE NEXT LEVEL AND DO THEIR HUNDRED SIXTY HOUR TRAINING WHERE THEY'LL GET THEIR DRIVER OPERATOR. AND ADDITIONAL TRAININGS FOR WILDLAND AND STRUCTURED TRAINING THAT GOES ON FROM THERE DIDN'T LOOK MODE MOVES ON OUT THOSE THAT WANT TO GO ON TO GET DIFFERENT TWENTY OUR. TRAINING TO BECOME A A NATIONALIZED. EMT CERTAINLY CAN DO SO AND THOSE THAT WANT TO JUST TAKE THE STATE TRAINING WHICH I FORGET WHAT THE HOURS ARE NOW. ON THAT IS WHEN SIXTY SO YEAH. AND. THANKS FOR A GREAT GIFT. SO THANK YOU FORGET. THERE'S ZERO ZERO ZERO THREE THAT'S WHY. SOMETIMES. I'M GETTING BORED ALONE. THAT WAS NICELY DONE NICELY DONE BAD HUMOR BAD HUMOR. BUT. IF YOU LOOK AT IT. IN THAT NOW I DAY IT WAS A HUNDRED TWENTY HOURS. WE GOING TO HUNDRED SIXTY HOURS. WHAT WAS REQUIRED DAN IS ALMOST A MIRROR OF WHAT WE HAVE TODAY THOUGH? AND AND. THE CHALLENGES THOUGH WE'VE NOW CAN GO ON AND GET THE THE NATIONALIZED LEVEL WHERE WE CAN PRACTICE IN ANY STATE WHICH I HAVE DONE. THAT TAKES A GREAT DEAL OF CONCENTRATION AND AND STUDY BUT BACK HERE POINT. FOLKS AT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. THAT ONE GOING TO BE A COMMON EMT THAT'S ON THEIR TIME. AND IN SOME FIRE DEPARTMENTS YOU ACTUALLY PAY FOR YOU IF YOU WANT ONE BUT THEY DON'T HOLD YOU BACK. LEAST EVERY FOUR DIFFERENT I WORKED WITH IN HIS STATE SO I I'M JUST A LITTLE PERPLEXED AND MAYBE IN IS NOT ABLE TO GET ACROSS THE LINE TODAY. AND WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO ENCOURAGE ANY OTHER MEMBER APPEARED TO RECOGNIZE THE VALUE OF THIS BILL AT THIS TIME. BUT I APPRECIATE YOU PERCENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR INPUT. ESTIMATES. SO WHAT WHEN I FIRST THE. LOOK AT THIS AND STAFF RECOMMENDATION WAS AN OPPOSE AND AS I BEGAN TO DIG INTO IT A LITTLE BIT MORE. I BECAME BEST SYMPATHETIC TO THE CAUSE. IT BECAUSE I THINK IN OUR SOCIETY WE'VE GONE TOO FAR WHEN YOU START TO THINK ABOUT PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES. COMING FROM PREACHER'S KID BOMB I WOULD SAY SEN HAPPENS. AND. WHEN WHAT WHEN IT WHEN IT HAPPENS. IT SEEMS AS THOUGH WE DON'T JUST PUNISH YOUR AND THEN AFTER PUNISHMENT THERE'S FORGIVENESS IN THERE'S REDEMPTION IT SAYS IF YOU NOW HAVE TO. BE FORGIVEN OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND THEN AT THE PUNISHMENT AND THAT BEING THE BECOMING A GREATER THAN WHAT WHAT WAS ACTUALLY OF SHOULD HAVE BEEN. AND THEN SOME AS I'M LISTENING I'M ALSO SYMPATHETIC TO HEARING THESE GUYS TO MY LEFT. BUT WHO HAVE BEEN IN THE SERVICE AND UNDERSTAND IT BETTER THAN A BETTER THAN I DO. BUT THEN IT SEEMS AS THOUGH MAYBE THERE'S. AT SOME MIDDLE GROUND A THAT THAT'S THAT'S HERE. BECAUSE ALSO THEY JUST PUBLIC LIABILITY FOR SOME THESE AGENCIES AS WELL SO IS THERE IS THERE IT IS THERE SOME MIDDLE GROUND THAT YOU GUYS CAN FIND. UNDERSTANDING WHAT MISS RACES IS TRYING TO DO HERE IS THERE SOME WAY OF BEING ABLE TO. ADD TO TO THE TO TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. AND MAYBE FIND SOME AMENDMENTS TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. ABSOLUTELY SIR THERE IS MIDDLE GROUND I BELIEVE. IS AYE IS WE MENTIONED WE WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS. HAY THAT THIS BILL HAS OPPORTUNITIES ARM BUT THE IMPORTANT POINT IS THE FACT WARY HAVE A PROCESS IN PLACE. IS MR MAGNETO POINT OUT HE REVIEWS THESE ALREADY I DO AS MEDICAL DIRECTOR SO THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT'S NOT CURRENTLY HAPPENING ALREADY NEMS AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WHAT'S THE PROCESS FOR YOU GUYS WHEN. BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THIS IS FOR EXISTING LICENSE HOLDERS AS WELL IF SOMEBODY DOES SOMETHING. NOT IN THE LINE OF WORK. IF SOMEBODY GOT IT DO YOU LIE THAT IS THEIR LICENSE GET PULLED IT RIGHT AWAY WHAT PROCESS DO YOU HAVE WHAT KIND OF DISCRETION DO YOU HAVE. AND THEN WHAT KIND OF. A JUDGMENT DO YOU USE TO BUILD A SAY YEP THIS GUYS OR GALS GOOD IN THIS ONE IS NOT GOOD. BOOK BECAUSE AGAIN I'M VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THIS BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S SOME GOOD PEOPLE THAT MIGHT BE LEFT OUT BECAUSE THEY'VE DONE SOMETHING WRONG. FIVE YEARS AGO TEN YEARS AGO FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. AND THERE'S NO THREAT. OF OF ANY IF ANY HARM IN DOING THE WORK SO WHAT. IT WHETTED MY IDEAS COME UP WITH THAT. THERE IS THAT THE PROCESS IS IS WHEN WE GET A. REPORT BACK FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THAT AN EMT ADD THAT WE HAVE CERTIFIED FOR INSTANCE. HAS BEEN ARRESTED. IT STARTS THE PROCESS SO ONCE THEY'RE DONE WITH THEIR COURT CASE. WE'D START LOOKING WE REQUEST THE COURT DOCUMENTS WHAT DID THEY. WHAT WAS THERE CONVICTION HOW LONG AGO AND IT'S BOTH FOR NEW APPLICANTS AND? RE CERTIFYING A EMTS ALSO WE USE THE SAME PROCESS. SO ONCE WE GET ALL THE DOCUMENTS AND WE FIND OUT. WHAT THEIR CONVICTION WAS WHAT THE COURT ORDERED DID THEY COMPLETE THE COURT REQUIREMENTS? HOW LONG AGO THE THE CONVICTION MAY HAVE BEEN? WE PUT WE LOOK AT IT ALL AND DOES IT MEET THE MODEL DISCOVERY GUIDELINES THAT PART ESTABLISHED. BY THE STATE WHICH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS HAD IT APART AND BACK INTO THE EARLY TWO THOUSAND TEN. THEN THE ADMINISTRATOR WILL MAKE A RECOMMENDATION TO OUR MEDICAL DIRECTOR YES THIS PERSON FOR INSTANCE HAD FIRST TIME THE U. WHY. THEY ARE CURRENTLY EMPLOYED BY THEIR EMPLOYER. AND THEY'VE DONE ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS THAT THE COURT REQUESTED THEM. WE FEEL THAT THIS PERSON IS EIGHTEEN YOU WITH THEIR RECERTIFICATION OR THEIR NEW CERTIFICATION. IN THE FOUR YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN THE ADMINISTRATOR AT SACRAMENTO COUNTY I'VE APPROVED. PROBABLY CLOSE TO TWO THOUSAND NEW AND RECERTIFY AND. EMTS AND I'VE I'VE ONLY HAD ONE WHERE I'VE HAD RECOMMENDED DENIAL. INTO REVOCATION OF THAT EMT CERTIFICATION BECAUSE HE WAS UNDER THE INFLUENCE. WHILE ON DUTY. SO WE HAVE THOSE PROCESSES IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY IS NOT ONE OF THE LARGEST AGENCIES BUT WHERE LIKE SIXTEEN. IN NUMBERS BUT I ALSO HAVE TO CERTIFY ALL THE STATE. AGENCIES SUCH AS CAL FIRE CHP. PARK AND REC IF THEY HAVE AN E. N. T.. THEY HAVE TO BECAUSE THEY'RE HEADQUARTERED HERE IN SACRAMENTO THE WAY THE STATUTE TO WRITTEN. MY AGENCY OR THE WHAT IS THE ONE THAT. REVIEWS SOME AND APPROVES THEM AND. KEEP SOME CERTIFIED SO I HAVE NOT JUST. THE EMTS WITHIN THE COUNTY. I HAVE BETWEEN ALL MY PROBABLY WITH THE STATE AGENCIES I'M LOOKING AT PROBABLY CLOSE TO TEN THOUSAND EMTS IN THAT I CERTIFY. REGULARLY SO THE PROCESS WORKS AND IT WORKS IN ALL AGENCIES OF ALL THIRTY THREE OF US. MISTER RODRIGUEZ. I THANK THE MEMBER FROM ARE BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. ANOTHER TORN AS I I SEE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IT AND I THINK I ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE TOOK THE WORDS OUT OF MY MOUTH WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT. YOU NOT AS AS AN EMT IF YOU'RE WORKING OUT THERE. REALLY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF SUPERVISION WAS JUST YOU AND YOUR PARTNER IN IN DEALING WITH WITH PATIENTS AT THE WORST. IN DEALING WITH PERSONAL BELONGINGS AS WELL. BUT ONE THING I MUST SAY YOU NOT. NOT BEING A FIREFIGHTER MYSELF BUT BEING. DISPATCHED TO WILDFIRES WITH. FIRE PERSONNEL I CAN TELL YOU THAT. THOSE CAMP CREWS ARE IMMIGRANTS HOW PEOPLE REFER THEM TO ONE OF THE HARDEST WORKING GUYS OUT THERE I THINK. OUR COLLEAGUES ARE HERE CAN CAN. CAN. AGREE WITH ME ON THAT THE OTHER THE HARDEST WORKING GUYS NOTHING ON THE FIRE LINE. I'VE SEEN THEM I I'VE TING CARE SOME OF THEM IF THEY GOT HURT. BUT THEN OPPOSED IT PUTS ME AT AN AWKWARD SITUATION ON ON THE OTHER END OF IT. AS AN EMT AND AND. AND I THINK MOTHER KALI TALKED ABOUT IT. NOT EVERY DEPARTMENT REQUIRES A INTO LICENSE. I'M SOME OF SOME DO AND SOME DON'T SO I GUESS IN A SENSE IT LIMITS. YOUR AVAILABILITY RIGHT THAT YOU CAN ONLY APPLY FOR CERTAIN DEPARTMENTS AND I THINK MAYBE AS. TIME CHANGES MORE DEPARTMENTS WILL START REQUIRING THAT. BUT RIGHT NOW THEIR LIMITED BECAUSE OF THAT NATURE. SO WITH THAT SAID IT IS I'M TORN BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING TO DO GIVE THEM A CHANCE I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT COUPLE PENAL CODES ABOUT THE SECTIONS ABOUT. THE TYPES OF CRIMES I DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE ARE SO MAYBE. IF SOMEBODY OR THE MEMBER CONSENT TO THE LIST OF WHAT WHAT KIND OF CRIMES THAT WOULD BE. FALL UNDER. AND. SECOND LOOK AT A LITTLE BIT MORE. I IN ON THE OTHER HAND TO. WE TALK ABOUT WHEN OFFICE WHEN INDIVIDUALS. GET A ARE CAUGHT RIGHT OR THIS THE DRUNK DRIVER AND WHATEVER WE TALKED ABOUT THE PROCESS. IT IS THERE A TIME LIMIT ON THAT PROCESS WHETHER IT'S SIX MONTHS A YEAR OR. IF SOMEBODY GETS ARRESTED FOR THE DRUNK DRIVING IS GOING TAKE FOR FIVE YEARS OR OR OR DO WE LOOK AT. GIVEN THIS PERSON THAT MAY HAVE HAD AN ISSUE TOOK CORRECTED AND COME BACK IS IS THERE ANY TALK ABOUT. THAT TIME FRAME OF MISS. THE OTHER CURRENT STATUTE DOESN'T. STATE A TIME LINE FOR THEY PROCESS TO GO THROUGH. AS I SAID BEFORE WE WE TRY TO WAIT INTELL. THEIR CONVICTION IS DONE IN THE COURT. AND UNFORTUNATELY SOMETIMES THAT TAKES A LOT. AWHILE AGO MOST OF THE AGENCIES THAT I DEAL WITH HERE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY. A THEY WILL CONTINUE TO ALLOW THEIR EMPLOYEE TO WORK WHETHER GOING THROUGH THE COURT PROCESS. BECAUSE THEY'RE LIGHT THEIR CERTIFICATION IS STILL GOOD UNTIL MY AGENCY TAKE SOME TYPE OF ACTION ON IT. WITH IT. AGAIN FIRST TIME DI Y. FIRST TIME. STAFF BASED ON WHAT IT IS. WILL WILL WILL MAKE THE RECOMMENDATION OF JUST DOING A PROBATIONARY TYPE. CERTIFICATION WHERE THEY CAN CONTINUE TO WORK. BUT THEY HAVE TO CHECK IN WITH MY AGENCY AND DO CERTAIN THINGS. DURING THAT PROBATION BUT MOST OF THE TIME THAT'S NOT UNTIL AFTER THEIR COURT CASES. THEN I JUST ONE MORE QUESTION COMES TO MIND. SO SAY IF. THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD IT GETS SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. AND WE GIVE THESE INDIVIDUALS AT THE SECOND CHANCE AT LIFE SO TO SPEAK TO GET THEIR EMPTY LICENSE. SO I'M THINKING ABOUT. SO IF I CAN GET MY EMT LICENSE EVEN THOUGH I MAY HAVE HAD A PASSPORT WE'VE YOU KNOW TO CARE THAT. BUT SOME OF THESE FIRE DEPARTMENTS MAY HAVE AN ISSUE IF YOU'RE LOOKING THE APPLY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. NOW THEY HAVE THEIR OWN SETS OF EMPLOYMENT QUALIFICATIONS OR SPEAK. SUTTER OF THAT'S GOING TO POSE A CHALLENGE FROM SO HERE I WANT TO GET THEIR HOPES UP. I GOT INTO LICENSE TODAY IN AND THE YEAR I WANT TO GET HARD BY THIS DEPARTMENT OF THAT DEPARTMENT BUT THEN AS THEY DO APPLY GO THROUGH THE PROCESS. GUESS WHAT. YOU HAVE THE SENIOR RECORD FROM FIVE YEARS AGO OR TEN YEARS AGO SO IT'S GONNA BE ANOTHER ROADBLOCK FROM THEM I DON'T KNOW IF WE'VE LOOKED AT THAT WOULD IT WOULD HE THINK. WILL HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THAT AND I DO WANT TO JUST FOR YOU ASKED ABOUT THE THING VIOLENT CRIMES. WE HAVE INCLUDED LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT ALLOWS THE REGULATING AUTHORITIES. STILL DENY LICENSE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING. DIRECTLY IN ADVERSELY RELATED CONVICTIONS WITH OF THE PRECEDING FIVE YEARS. VIOLENT FELONIES AS DEFINED IN THE PENAL CODE WE'RE NOT CHANGING WHAT A VIOLENT CRIME IS. A VIOLENT FELONY IS ALREADY DEFINED THEIR TWENTY THREE THEIR DEFINED IN THE PENAL CODE. THIS BILL DOES NOT. READ TO FIND THAT THEY'RE ALREADY DEFINED. PLUS ANY FELONIES THAT WOULD PLACE SOMEONE ON THE SEX OFFENSE REGISTRY THEY'RE EXCLUDED FROM THIS. THE. WE THERE'S TALK ABOUT CAL FIRE AND. COURSE WE'RE TALKING TO AN EXPERT TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER FLORA. THAT IS HIS PROFESSION. BUT THEY THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS HAVE YOU IN OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM THEY HAVE TOLD US IT IS OFTEN A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT IN MUNICIPAL FIRE DEPARTMENTS. THAT THEY THAT THE APPLICANT BE HAVE AN E. EMMAUS. BUT OUR EMT LICENSE. WE HAVE WORKED WITH THE HEALTH COMMITTEE HERE WITH THE STAFF TRIED TO COME UP WITH. RESPOND TO MANY OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN VOICED HERE TODAY. AND WE DO WELCOME THE M. EMSA EMSA NEWS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS INPUT. BECAUSE WE WANT TO WORK DILIGENTLY TOWARDS A RESOLUTION THAT ADDRESSES THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN VOICED HERE AND UP BY THE BY MY MEMBERS. WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THIS OPPORTUNITY. IT'S JUST OPENING A DOOR WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT THEY WILL AUTOMATICALLY NOW BE HIRED AS AN EMT OR THAT THEY WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE. HIRED AS A IS. AS A FIREFIGHTER. WELL WERE NOT PRECLUDING THEM FROM MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION. THEY'VE ALREADY DONE THAT TYPE OF SERVICE WITH THE CONSERVATION CAMP. THERE WERE GOOD ENOUGH TO DO WITH THEIR. AND WE NOW WANT TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT EVEN TO BE TO BE QUALIFIED THROUGH THE CONSERVATION CAMP THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH QUITE A PROCEDURE. TO BE ACCEPTED TO BE PUT ON THE FRONT LINES. TO BE FIRE FIGHTING OUT TO TO TO TO JOIN WITH THE FIRE FIGHTING. SO THAT THERE IS AN ENTIRE PROCESS THAT HAPPENS BEFORE THEY CAN DO THAT. THEN OUR SAYING. WOULD LIKE TO APPLY FOR THESE JOBS BUT MANY OF THE JOBS WE WANT TO APPLY FOR DO REQUIRED THIS WE'RE JUST SAYING LET'S OPEN THE DOOR SO THEY CAN APPLY. AND IT ISN'T A NO AT THE MOMENT THEY APPLY. THEY NOW WERE GIVEN THAT OPPORTUNITY THERE NO GUARANTEES THERE NO GUARANTEES FOR ANY OF US WHEN WE TO OBTAIN A LICENSE BUT DOORS ARE SHUT WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE THE LICENSE. AND WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM. WELL THANK YOU SO I I'M I'M LOOKING TO SUPPORT IT BUT I'M GONNA AND RESERVE MY RIGHT SEE HOW THINGS COME UP FOR GETS TO THE FLOOR. BUT WE CONTINUE WORK WITH OPPOSITION AND. REDEFINING SOME OF THESE THINGS AND AND MOVED AROUND LUGGAGE PROCESS OF ONE THANK FOR BRING UP FOR AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS THANK YOU. CARILLO. Q.. THANK THE AUTHOR FOR PRE. YOU ARE A TEN. COMMITTEE AND. LIKELY AYE TO POINT OUT THAT WHEN YOU'RE SUPPORTERS IS AN ORGANIZATION CALLED HOMEBOY INDUSTRIES. WHICH IS IN THE FIFTY FIRST ASSEMBLY DISTRICT STARTED BY FATHER GREG BOYLE. IN THE COMMUNITY THAT I GREW UP IN. OFTENTIMES WE TALK ABOUT AND THEIR MOTTO IS JOBS NOT JAILS NOTHING STOPS A BULLET LIKE A JOB. WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT THE NEED FOR MORE FIREFIGHTERS MAUREEN TEASE VARIOUS OTHER PROFESSIONS ACROSS OUR STATE. I ALSO SAID ON PUBLIC SAFETY. TODAY WE DISCUSSED A SIMILAR PUMP WE HAD A SIMILAR CONVERSATION IN TERMS OF. HOW CALIFORNIA ANOTHE DEFIER DEPARTMENTS ARE? ARE NOT ABLE TO HIRE THE FIRE. THE FIREFIGHTERS THAT THEY WOULD LIKE BECAUSE OF CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS. WE HAVE HAD SO THE STATE HAS HAD SEVERAL. FIRES ACROSS OUR STATE THAT HAVE USED PRISON LABOR TO PUT THOSE OUT. OFTENTIMES VISA. MEN AND WOMEN WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE DOING THE WORK THAT THEY HAVE BEEN TRAINED FOR. CENTER NOT ALLOWED BECAUSE OF THE RESTRICTIONS THAT WE HAVE ACROSS OUR STATE. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS ALSO DONE INCREDIBLE WORK ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. THAT HAS OPENED UP THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MEN AND WOMEN ACROSS OUR STATE TO BE ABLE TO LEAVE PRISON. AND BE REUNITED WITH THEIR FAMILIES. WE FACE A HOUSING CRISIS WE FACE A HOMELESSNESS POPULATION INCREASE. WE FACE ALL KINDS OF DOCUMENTS THAT. THESE MEN AND WOMEN ARE FACING WHEN THEY RETURN HOME AND MY COMMUNITY WERE ALSO FACING GENTRIFICATION. IT'S DONE FOLKS COMING BACK GETTING OUT OF PRISON FIND IN THEIR COMMUNITY NOT BEING THE WAY THAT IT USED TO BE. THERE'S A LACK OF JOBS THERE'S A LACK OF OPPORTUNITY THERE'S A LACK OF RESOURCES. THIS IS THE AN IDEA I THINK IT'S A. IT'S IT'S A MEASURE IN WAYS THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY. BRING MORE PEOPLE IN. IF YOU HAVE. SERVED YOUR TIME. IF YOU ARE WILLING TO DO THE WORK IF YOU DO NOT FALL WITHIN THE GUIDELINES THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY LAID OUT IN TERMS OF YOU ARE NOT. GOING TO ENDANGER THE LIVES OF THOSE THAT YOU. WOULD WANT TO SERVE. THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION FOR STATE. AND SO I AM MORE THAN COMMITTED TO TO WORKING WITH YOUR WITH YOUR OFFICE AND WITH THOSE THAT HAVE CONCERNS IN TERMS OF. HOW DO WE AT THE END OF THE DAY MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE JOBS? THE PEOPLE HAVE OPPORTUNITY THAT IF THEY WANT TO SERVE AND DO THIS WORK WHICH IS NOT EASY. AS MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE KNOW THAT YOU DO THIS YOU'VE DONE THIS IN THE PAST. THAT WOULD PROVIDE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES AND THEN WE SET THE EXAMPLE THAT CALIFORNIA IS A STATE. WERE YOU CAN. YOU IF YOU COMMIT A CRIME AND YOU PAYER IF YOU PAID WITH THEIR TIME. THE YOU WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET A JOB AND START OVER AND LIVE A LIFE AND LIVE AND NOT ONLY SURVIVE BUT THRIVE. AND BE GOOD AT WHAT YOU DO. SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS TO OUR ATTENTION THANK YOU FOR TO THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE MADE THE DIALOGUE. WHAT IT IS NOW?

CERTAIN CRIMES ARE ALREADY EXCLUDED WHAT. I WANT THE SAFETY OF OF ANYBODY WHO'S EVER SERVED BY IAN MANY EMPTY OR FIREFIGHTER I WANT THAT JUST AS MUCH AS ANYBODY ELSE WOULD WANT THAT. I'M NOT TRYING TO PUT SOMEONE IS GOING TO CAUSE HARM. ODE TO AND NOT TRY TO PUT THEM IT IN THE HOME SOMEBODY WHO'S VULNERABLE. BUT I ABSOLUTELY WANT TO PROVIDE THAT SECOND CHANCE TO SOMEONE WHO IS PAID THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY SIMPLY TO OPEN THE DOORS THEY STILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS AS ANYBODY ELSE WOULD. I GIVE THEM THAT OPPORTUNITY AND I DO MAKE A COMMITMENT TO. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS TO TRY TO FIND A WAY THAT WE WILL ALL BE ABLE TO WORK.

DOCTOR ARAMBULA YOU HAVE BEFORE US. ITEM NUMBER SEVENTEEN AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY FOUR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BEFORE I BEGAN I WANT TO SAY THAT I'M GOING TO BE ACCEPTING THAT COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THANK YOU. CALIFORNIA LIKE THE REST OF THE NATION IS GRAPPLING WITH A SERIOUS HEALTH CARE DILEMMA. HOW TO USE OPIOID MEDICATION TO RELIEVE PAIN SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY WHILE AT THE SAME TIME REDUCING THE RISK OF PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION MISUSE? ADDICTION AND OVERDOSE. AS AN EMERGENCY ROOM PHYSICIAN I SAW THE IMPACT THAT OPIOID ABUSE HAVE ON FAMILIES FIRST HAND. I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO ENSURE WE ARE USING OPIOIDS EFFECTIVELY AND DO OUR BEST TO TREAT SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY FOUR WILL CONTINUE TO ADVANCE CALIFORNIA IN THE DIRECTION OF RECOVERY. AS IT REMOVES BARRIERS TWO SOME% OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND INNOVATIVE TREATMENT OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS AND MEDICATION ASSISTED THERAPY. COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS AN A. T.. MIT AS THE USE OF MEDICATIONS IN COMBINATION WITH COUNSELING AND BEHAVIORAL THERAPIES. TO PROVIDE A WHOLE PATIENT APPROACH TO THE TREATMENT OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT. A COMBINATION OF MEDICATION AND COUNSELLING THERAPY CAN SUCCESSFULLY TREAT THESE DISORDERS AND FOR SOME PEOPLE STRUGGLING WITH ADDICTION. ME T. CAN HELP AND SUSTAIN RECOVERY. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH BENEFITS REVIEW PROGRAM ANALYSIS OF THIS BILL. THERE IS A CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT MEDICATIONS USED TO TREAT ME T. FOR OPIOID USE DISORDER ARE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN PLACEBO OR NO TREATMENT FOR RETENTION OF PATIENTS. AND TREATMENT ABSTINENCE FROM OPIOIDS AND BIRTH OUTCOMES. THIS ANALYSIS ALSO PROJECTS THAT IN THE FIRST YEAR POST MANDATE OF THIS BILL. WE WOULD DECREASE ILLICIT DRUG USE DECREASE OPIOID OVERDOSE DECREASE OVERDOSE RELATED MORTALITY. A DECREASE POOR MATERNAL AND FETAL OUTCOMES AND TO ALSO DECREASE HIV AND HEPATITIS C. TRANSMISSION AMONG ABOUT TEN THOUSAND NEW CALIFORNIAN ME TWO USERS. MEDICATION USED AN MA T. ARE APPROVED BY THE FEDERAL DRUG ADMINISTRATION AN EMMY T. PROGRAMS ARE CLINICALLY TRICK. DRIVEN AND TAILORED TO MEET EACH PATIENT'S NEEDS. CALIFORNIA IS LEADING THE COUNTRY AND MULTI YEAR REDUCTION OF OVERDOSE DEATHS FROM PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS. AND NOW WE HAVE A CHANCE TO LEAD AND PROVIDING CRITICAL RECOVERY SERVICES AS WELL. AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY FOUR WILL HAVE A DIRECT AFFECT IN REMOVING BARRIERS TO ACCESSING HIGH QUALITY EVIDENCE BASED CARE. WITH THESE MEASURES I HOPE WE ARE ABLE TO REDUCE THE MISUSE OF OPIOIDS WHILE ALSO EFFECTIVELY RELIEVING PAIN. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS MEGHAN ALLRED FROM THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS MAKE IT ALRIGHT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. SPONSORS OF AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY FOUR. IT'S ONE OF THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BEING WILLING TO TAKE THIS ON WE OF REALLY HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON SHIFTING THE CONVERSATION TO. PREVENTION AND TREATMENT NOW THAT WE HAVE TAKEN A LOT OF THE. PRESCRIPTIONS OFF THE MARKET WE NEED TO. GIVE THAT. GIVE OPTIONS FOR TREATMENT TO THOSE WHO NEED IT. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN MORE THAN TWO POINT ONE MILLION PEOPLE AGED TWELVE AND ORDER LAST YEAR MET THE DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR AN OPIOID USE DISORDER. TREATMENT OF OPIOID USE DISORDER WITH MEDICATION ASSISTANT TREATMENT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE COST EFFECTIVE. SAFE AND SUCCESSFUL WHEN USED APPROPRIATELY FURTHER OPIOID MAINTENANCE THERAPIES HAVE NOT ONLY BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE ABSENCE FROM ILLICIT OPIOIDS. BUT ALSO BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE MORTALITY FROM OVERDOSE WITH EVEN A FRIEND HAVING COME COMPARABLE MORTALITY REDUCTIONS COMPARED TO METHADONE. I. WHEN PHARMACOTHERAPY IS RANDOMIZED AND NOT SELF SELECTED BY THE PATIENT DESPITE THIS EVIDENCE ONLY TEN PERCENT OF AMERICANS SEEKING MAC WERE ABLE TO ACCESS THAT WITH INSURANCE UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT POLICIES. POSING A SIGNIFICANT OBSTACLE. MANY HEALTH PLANS USE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REAUTHORIZATION FAIL FIRST CRITERIA. AND PLACE ANNUAL OR LIFETIME MEDICATION LIMITS AS A MEANS OF REDUCING EXPENDITURES BUT IN DOING SO RESTRICT ACCESS TO THESE TREATMENT SERVICES. WELL THESE POLICIES HAVE THE INTENTION OF REDUCING AN APPROPRIATE CARE THEY ALSO INTERRUPT PATIENT CARE DURING A TIME IN WHICH ONE DAY OR LAST CAN MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE. NOT TO MENTION DIVERTING POSITION RESOURCES AWAY FROM DIRECT PATIENT CARE. I TWENTY SEVENTEEN CALIFORNIA'S SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE SURVEY. SURVEY OUR SURVEY OF ITS POSITION MEMBERSHIP INDICATED THAT FIFTY SIX PERCENT OF RESPONDENTS FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO ACCESS MAP FOR PATIENTS NEW TO TREATMENT DUE TO INSURANCE CARRIERS. WITH FORTY ONE PERCENT EXPERIENCING SITUATIONS WHERE PATIENTS WENT WITHOUT TREATMENT. AND JUST TO QUOTE THE. I'M DOCTOR DAVID KAHN PRESIDENT OF. CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE. I WE DON'T REQUIRE DIABETICS TO PROVE THEY ARE ATTENDING NUTRITION VISITS FOR THEIR INSURANCE TO COVER INSULIN A MEDICINE THAT IS DEADLY AN OVERDOSE. HOWEVER INSURANCE COMPANIES FREQUENTLY CUT PATIENTS OFF TREATMENT IF WE DON'T SUBMIT DETAILED CLINICAL RECORDS PROVING ATTENDANCE AT COUNSELING AND DRUG SCREENS SHOWING PERFECT COMPLIANCE SOMETHING WE DON'T SEE OR EXPECT IN ANY OTHER CHRONIC DISEASE. WITH THAT WE ASK YOUR SUPPORT. OTHER SUPPORT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN WAS YES OUT TOM RENT FREE WITH THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION.

MISTER CHAIR TOM RILEY WITH THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS AND STRONG SUPPORT. YEAH I MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS NICK LOUISE US ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS THAT WERE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. I MISS TERM MEMBERS WE TOTALLY AGREE THAT YOU IF YOU'RE CRISIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE. ON INDEED CONCERNS ABOUT OPIOID MIS USE ADDICTION AND OVERDOSES OF WHAT HEALTH PLANS IN CALIFORNIA AND NATIONALLY TO TAKE A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THIS AREA. FOR EXAMPLE OUR SISTER TRADE ASSOCIATION YOU AMERICA'S ASSOCIATES AMERICA'S HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS RECENTLY LAUNCHED ITS SAFE TRANSPARENT OPIOID PRESCRIBING INITIATIVE OR THE STOP INITIATIVE. WHICH IS DESIGNED TO SUPPORT WIDESPREAD WIDESPREAD ADOPTION OF CLINICAL GUIDELINES FOR PAIN CARE IN OPIOID PRESCRIBING. HEALTH PLANS HAVE CONSISTENTLY SUPPORTED THE CDC'S OPIOID GUIDELINES TO PROMOTE EVIDENCE BASED. PAIN CARE AND REDUCE UNNECESSARY OPIOID PRESCRIBING. MANY HEALTH PLANS HAVE ALREADY INSTITUTED NEW PROGRAMS THAT ARE HELPING TO DRAMATICALLY REDUCE HOW MUCH AND HOW OFTEN. OPIOIDS ARE PRESCRIBED. AND IN ADDITION TO THAT ENSURING THE AVAILABILITY OF MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENTS FOR ADDICTION WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS BILL IS SOMETHING THAT'S WIDELY SUPPORTED BY PLANS. ON IN MAY BE MOVING TO ENCOURAGE A MORE USE OF THESE DRUGS. WELL WE DON'T OBJECT TO THE OVERALL GOAL OF REDUCING OPIOID USE IN CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL IS VERY VERY BROAD FROM OUR OF. PERSPECTIVE HOW WE VIEW THIS IS KIND OF A SUPER DRUG MANDATE THAT CONTAINS ALL THE GREATEST HITS THAT WE'VE SEEN BEFORE IN DRUG MANDATE BILLS. IT REQUIRES ANY AND EVERY FDA APPROVED DRUG TO BE COVERED BY HEALTH PLAN EVEN FUTURE DRUGS THAT WE OBVIOUSLY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT THIS POINT IN TIME. AND MAY NOT BE ANY BETTER THAN WHAT CURRENTLY EXISTS ON THE MARKET WHETHER IT'S IN GENERIC FORM AND OR OR ANY MORE COST EFFICIENT FORM. SOME ALL FDA APPROVED DRUGS UNDER THIS BILL. WOULD BE COVERED WITHOUT CONSIDERATION MEDICAL NECESSITY WE DON'T VIEW THAT THE AMENDMENT. THAT IS TAKING TODAY IS TOTALLY FIXING THAT ISSUE AND WE OF COURSE DO NOT COVER ANY DRUGS THAT ARE. MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY. ABSOLUTELY NO UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT LIKE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION TO STEP THERAPY WOULD BE ALLOWED FOR ANY OF THESE DRUGS I'M EVEN DRUGS IT WOULD BE APPROVED BY THE FDA IN THE FUTURE. EVEN IF THERE ARE. CLINICAL ARE COSTING SERRATIONS IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS A PART OF A PLANS COVERAGE GUIDELINES. IN ADDITION. THERE'S A VERY I TROUBLING. LATEST AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL ON A PLAN IN ITS COVERAGE POLICIES CANNOT REQUIRE THAT THE DRUG BE TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY. A REGIMEN. NO UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT AND CANNOT REQUIRE THE PERSON TO ALSO BE IN ANY KIND OF THERAPY OR PEER SUPPORT RECOVERY PROGRAM. WE DON'T BELIEVE THIS BE CONSISTENT WITH FEDERAL OR MEDICAL COMMUNITY RECOGNIZE DEFINITIONS. A FOR INSTANCE THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION DEFINES MEDICAL A MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENTS AS. THE USEOF FDA APPROVED MEDICATIONS IN COMBINATION WITH COUNSELING A BEHAVIORAL THERAPIES. TO PROVIDE A WHOLE PATIENT APPROACH TO THE TREATMENT OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS. THE ADMINISTRATION'S ALSO WEBSITE ALSO STATES THAT UNDER FEDERAL LAW MATT PATIENTS MUST RECEIVE COUNSELING. WHICH COULD INCLUDE DIFFERENT FORMS OF BEHAVIORAL THERAPY. I'M ALSO FROM OTHER WEBSITE IN ORDER TO RECEIVE HER MAINTAIN A WAIVER TO ACTUALLY DELIVER THE DRUGS A PHYSICIAN MUST BE CAPABLE OF REFERRING A PATIENT COUNSELING OR OTHER SERVICES. MEMBERS EITHER MEDICAL MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENTS NAM MEDICATION ONLY TREATMENTS. THIS IS A VERY BROAD BILL THAT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE SETS OF A NUMBER OF TROUBLING PRECEDENCE. AND. THERE FOR WE ASK YOU TO VOTE NO ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN HE REPRESENT CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. I CAN'T CHAMBER POSES AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY FOUR CENTS THAT WOULD AMONG OTHER THINGS MANDATE COVERAGE FOR ALL MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS. AND WOULD ELIMINATE QUALITY CONTROL AND COST CONTAINMENT MECHANISMS FOR THE TREATMENT BOTH OF WHICH WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE HEALTHCARE COSTS. CHIPPER BEST MATES THAT IF AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY FOUR TO BECOME LAW. ANNUAL HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES IN CALIFORNIA WOULD INCREASE BY TWENTY FOUR POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS HOWEVER THE ANALYSIS ALSO STATES THAT THE COST PROJECTED COULD BE EXPONENTIALLY HIGHER IF LEGAL INTERPRETATIONS OF THE BILL DIFFER FROM THE ASSUMPTIONS IN THEIR ANALYSIS. WELL WELL INTENTIONED EMPLOYERS AND INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN FACING SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. THE INCREASE IN PREMIUMS AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY FOUR RESULTS AND WILL FOLLOW ON INDIVIDUALS AND SMALL TO MEDIUM SIZED EMPLOYERS WHICH WILL HELP TO DRIVE HEALTHY PEOPLE OUT OF THE MARKETPLACE. THEREBY LEAVING FEWER PEOPLE TO PAY FOR THIS MANDATE. FOR THESE REASONS CHAMBER COMMERCE AS OPPOSED THE BILL THANK YOU. THREE MUCH OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. STEPHANIE LICHENS ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES OPPOSED. AT THE MOST PREFERRED LOCAL HEALTH PLANS A CALIFORNIA ALSO POST. JOHN WINGER ON BEHALF AMERICA'S HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS BUT. PRE BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS IN THE QUESTIONS. SEE NOTES LIKE CLOSE DOCTOR ARAMBULA YES. I WANTED TO TOUCH ON SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE SAID TODAY AND THERE IS A GREAT PROBLEM WHICH IS FACING OUR GREAT STATE. AND THAT IS OPIOID USE DISORDERS. AND TO COMBAT IT WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE ALL TOOLS AVAILABLE FOR US. AND TO DO THAT I BELIEVE THIS BILL HELPS US TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION. FOR US TO BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY TREAT OPIOID USE DISORDERS WE HAVE TO FOLLOW EVIDENCE BASED MEDICINE AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL HELPS TO MOVE US FURTHER IN THAT CONVERSATION. THERE ARE TEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS WHO WOULD BENEFIT FROM THIS BILL. THERE ARE TEN THOUSAND OF OUR NEIGHBORS WHO ARE GONNA BE ABLE TO ACCESS SERVICES THAT COULD NOT HAVE ACCESS WITHOUT THIS BILL. I HUMBLY REQUEST AND I'VE. THANKS VERY MUCH DOCTOR ARAMBULA. THANK YOU FOR THE BRING THIS BILL FOR IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY NECESSARY. BUT WHO WE BELIEVE MEDICAID MEDICATED MEDICATIONS ASSISTANCE TREATMENT IS PROVEN TO BE CLINICALLY EFFECTIVE. AND TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE NEED FOR INPATIENT DETOXIFICATION SERVICES. THE BILL ENJOYS A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION ALAS MADAME SECRETARY TO PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. WE NEED A MOTION THAT I'M SORRY. QATAR AND MOTION. AND A SECOND MOST MEMBERS HAVE YOUR CURRY SECOND I MISS CARILLO MOTION IS DO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS MEN SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL WHAT. I WHAT I MAYES MAYES NO ANCHOR CURRY.

IT'S IT'S A SIX THREE SO WE'LL LEAVE THAT ON CALL AND YOU AND I WILL PRESENT THE NEXT BILL AND THEN. THE VERY PATIENT NEVER PRESENT MR MAIENSCHEIN WILL BE FOLLOWING US DOCTOR WOOD MISTER ARAMBULA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS INLAND AND ONCE AGAIN. APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY REARRANGE THINGS HERE. CHRIS PAUL I'D LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS. HEALTHCARE IS A RIGHT. AND YET NOT EVERYONE HAS IT. SOME HAVE GREAT HEALTH CARE. SOME HAVE INSURANCE BUT IT'S EXPENSIVE SOME BUYING FIND COVERAGE ON AFFORDABLE. SOME HAVE MEDI CAL. A STRUGGLE TO FIND CARE. AS SOME HAVE NOTHING. WE ALL KNOW HOW COMPLEX OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS. BUT I DO NOT SEE A SILVER BULLET ON THE HORIZON ASPIRATIONAL YES. REALISTICALLY NO. SO WHAT'S TO BE DONE. IT'S GOING TO BE A JOURNEY. WE NEED TO KNOW HOW TO PLOT OUR COURSE. THAT'S WHY I AND MY COLLEAGUE DR ARAMBULA HAVE A BILL THAT CREATES A PROCESS. TO BUILD A ROAD MAP. THE GOAL UNIVERSALLY PUBLIC FUNDED HEALTH CARE. THE BILL CREATES SEE ADVISORY PANEL ON HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS AND UNIVERSAL COVERAGE WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. AN INDEPENDENT PANEL THAT WILL DEVELOP A PLAN THAT CLUED INCLUDES A TIMELINE OF THE BENCHMARKS AND STEPS NECESSARY TO REACH THE GOAL. S. CO CHAIRS OF THE ASSEMBLY SELECT COMMITTEE ON HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS AND UNIVERSAL COVERAGE WE CAN MEAN A NUMBER OF HEARINGS BEGINNING LAST FALL MORE THAN THIRTY HOURS WORTH. TO HEAR FROM MANY WALRUS RESPECTED EXPERTS ABOUT WHERE WE ARE NOW. WHERE WE NEED TO GO AND HOW TO GET THERE? AS WE DUG DEEP INTO THIS COMPLEX POLICY ISSUE WE RECOGNIZE THAT TO BE SUCCESSFUL YOU MUST DIVINE OF DEFINED A PATHWAY THAT ADDRESSES A NUMBER OF ISSUES. INCLUDING CHALLENGES RELATED TO STATE AND FEDERAL LAW. MEDICARE'S FUNDED THROUGH PROTECTED MEDICARE TRUST FUND AND FEDERAL LAWS STAB WHICH IS THE RULES FOR HOW THAT MONEY CAN BE SPENT. ACCESSING THOSE FUNDS WOULD REQUIRE CONGRESSIONAL ACTION. PROP NINETY EIGHT AMENDED THE CONSTITUTION TO REQUIRE FORTY PERCENT OF STATE GENERAL FUND REVENUES GO TO K. THREE FOURTEEN EDUCATION. HOW WILL PROP NINETY EIGHT AFFECT NEW BUT REVENUES BROUGHT INTO HEALTHCARE? BEGAN LIMITS. FROM PROPOSITION THIRTEEN IN FOR. AMENDED THE CONSTITUTION TO IMPOSED SPENDING LIMITS ON THE STATE TO ENSURE THAT REVENUE IN EXCESS OF THOSE LIMITS WOULD BE RETURNED. TO THE TAXPAYERS. WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT THAT? CURRENTLY THREE POINT THREE MILLION CALIFORNIANS GET COVERAGE THROUGH SELF INSURED OR SELF FUNDED PLANS THEY'RE SUBJECT TO RISA. ADMINISTERED BY THE US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. THEY ARE EXEMPT FROM STATE SPECIFIC HEALTH INSURANCE REGULATIONS AND THEREFORE COULD NOT BE COMBINED INTO A SINGLE SYSTEM. IN ADDITION TO FEDERAL AND STATE STATUTORY CHAMP CHALLENGES ANY MEANINGFUL CHANGES TO THE CURRENT SYSTEM MUST HAVE BEEN THAT MECHANISM TO PREDICT AND MANAGE SEVERAL THINGS INCLUDING. THE EXTRA ORDINARY RISE IN HEALTHCARE COSTS. THE EXISTING AND PREDICTED SHORTAGE AND PHYSICIANS AND ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. FINALLY WE NEED. A MULTI YEAR FINANCIAL MODEL THAT INCLUDE STATE BUDGET IMPLICATIONS ASSESSMENT OF OPTIONS FOR RAISING REVENUES IN MANAGING COSTS. IDENTIFICATION OF THE SIZE OF POTENTIAL REVENUE SOURCES FOR PRUDENT RESERVE. STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND ANALYTICAL PROCESS TO DEVELOP COVERED BENEFITS ELIGIBILITY SERVICE DEVELOPED DELIVERY PROVIDER PAYMENTS. QUALITY IMPROVEMENT. WE NEED TO ESTABLISH A DATA COLLECTION REPORTING SYSTEM TO SUPPORT MANAGEMENT EVALUATION TRANSPORTATION TRANSPARENCY AND PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY. RECOMMEND WE NEED RECOMMENDATIONS TO BUILD AN IT SYSTEM AND A FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM CAPABLE OF ADMINISTERING A UNIVERSAL AND UNIFIED PUBLICLY FINANCED HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. WE NEED A FEASIBLE FINANCING SYSTEM AN ANALYSIS OF THE NEED FOR A VOTER APPROVAL OF ANY FUNDING MECHANISM. THIS BILL PROVIDES THE ROADMAP. THAT THE MAP AND THE PATH WE NEED. TO MOVE FORWARD AND I'M ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT MOVE THE BILL. AND WHAT ABOUT AT THIS POINT TO TURN THIS OVER TO DOCTOR ARAMBULA. I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT HEALTHCARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT. IT IS BECAUSE OF THAT BELIEF THAT I BECAME A DOCTOR. THE CARE FOR THE RESIDENTS ALL OF THE RESIDENTS OF THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. I ALSO SAW MANY OF THE LIMITATIONS OF OUR CURRENT HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. PARTICULARLY TO THOSE WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD ITERATED OUR HEARINGS IN THE ASSEMBLY SELECT COMMITTEE ON HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS AND UNIVERSAL. COVERAGE HELPED US UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND THE CHALLENGES WE MUST OVERCOME IN ORDER TO GET TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. AB TWENTY FIVE SEVENTEEN AIMS TO CREATE A ROADMAP TO HELP US ENVISIONED THE PATH FORWARD TOWARDS A UNIVERSAL. PUBLICLY FUNDED HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND GET US THERE STEP BY STEP. THROUGH THIS BILL WE WILL START OF COURSE TO SUCCESSFULLY ADDRESS. STATE AND FEDERAL LAW CHALLENGES INCLUDING FEDERAL WAIVERS AND STATUTORY CHANGES. AND STATE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS. WE AS A LEGISLATURE SHOULD ADDRESS THE HIGH COST OF HEALTHCARE SO WE CAN ACHIEVE MORE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO QUALITY HEALTHCARE. WE SHOULD WORK TOWARD MITIGATING EXCESSIVE HEALTH INSURER PROFITS AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS SO THAT MORE MONEY IS SPENT ON DIRECT CARE TO PATIENTS. WE SHOULD PROVIDE ALL CALIFORNIANS WITH HIGH QUALITY HEALTHCARE REGARDLESS OF AGE. INCOME RACE ETHNICITY IMMIGRATION STATUS GENDER SEXUAL ORIENTATION GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION HEALTH STATUS OR ABILITY. AND WE SHOULD TRAIN IN EMPLOYER HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE THAT CAN MEET THE HEALTHCARE NEEDS OF OUR GREAT STATE. MEMBERS ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD AN I WHOLE HEARTEDLY INTEND TO DO THIS I AM PROUD TO JOIN WE AUTHOR THIS MEASURE WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD. AND I HOPE WE CAN COUNT ON YOUR SUPPORT. THE DOCTOR ARAMBULA ANYMORE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MARRIED IF MANAGING FORESTS ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA WE HERE TO SUPPORT AB TWENTY FIVE SEVENTEEN. THE BILL ESTABLISHES AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO DEVELOP A ROADMAP TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE SYSTEM THAT INCLUDES A TIMELINE. AND THE RECOGNITION OF THE BEARS TO VARIOUS REFORMS LIKE THE STATE CONSTITUTION AND FEDERAL LAW. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE BILL'S GOAL OF GUARANTEED ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE THAT IMPROVES HEALTH OUTCOMES LOWERS HEALTHCARE COSTS AND REDUCES HEALTH DISPARITIES FORD THESE REASONS WE ASK ARRIVAL. ANYMORE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. LINDA WAIT. LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN SUPPORT. DALE FOUNTAIN CONNECTING EVER SO HEALTH CARE FOR CALIFORNIA. REPRESENTING HUNDRED EIGHT THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS SINGLE PAYER SUPPORTERS IN FULL SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ANGELA WILLIAMS CALIFORNIA LIKE ALFA NETWORK IN STRONG SUPPORT. GENTLEMAN JEFF TOWARD A KIA. I'M NOT IN STRONG SUPPORT BECAUSE LIKE OTHER LEGISLATION. THERE ARE GONNA BE UNINTENTIONAL CONSEQUENCES OF THIS. AND THE BIGGEST CONCERNS GOING TO BE IN ANY CAPACITY OF ADVISORY. IS EXACTLY WHO IS INFLUENCING THIS. SO ACCOUNTABILITY NEEDS TO BE HIGHLY IN THERE SIR ANYONE SO CONCERT I AM THAT NORMALLY SUPPORTING IT. ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. I ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE WILL COME BACK. TO MEMBER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. MISS WALDRON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M. WHO WERE HOW DO YOU FORESEE THE ADVISORY PANEL? YOU KNOW BEING SET UP AS FAR AS THE MEMBERSHIP. ON THE PANEL AND THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SERVICES SECRETARY WOULD APPOINT THE MEMBERS. NO CAN SO IS NO. CRITERIA LIKE THE. YOU KNOW HAVE TO BE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF HEALTH PROVIDERS OF. HEALTH PLANS OR STAKEHOLDERS OR. IS HAVE THEY HAVE GOTTEN UP FOR ME. STILL HAVEN'T GOTTEN IT SO. YEAH. THE ROADMAP WITH MAYBE A PIECE MISSING AT THIS POINT OKAY. SO JUST A COMMENT YOU KNOW HAVING SERVED WITH THE TWO DOCTORS ON THE UNIVERSAL CARE SELECT COMMITTEE. SO MUCH INFORMATION CAME OUT IS. ALMOST SEEMS LIKE IT WAS. IT JUST ENDED TOO SOON IN A WAY EVEN THOUGH WE HAD SEVERAL HEARINGS. THERE'S JUST SO MUCH INFORMATION. YOU KNOW. THE GOAL OF UNIVERSAL CARE IS SOMETHING. I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SUPPORT. BUT HOW YOU GET THERE OR THE ROADBLOCKS IN AND WE CAME UP WITH. HAVING TO GET WAIVERS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. YOU KNOW. WHAT THAT WOULD INVOLVE I MEAN THERE WERE SO MANY ISSUES AND COSTS AND THE SURPRISING I KNOW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT? LOOKING AT IF THERE'S ANY WAY TO REDUCE COSTS AND THAT JUST DIDN'T SEEM TO ME HE. WAS OTHER. STATES OR NATIONS WAS FACING AND YOU KNOW IF WE WANNA. WILL MOVE AHEAD AND REALLY ANALYZE THAT. IT'S ALMOST LIKE WE KEEP OUR SELECT COMMITTEE GOING WELL WE TASK OTHERS TO CONTINUE THE WORK TO GET BACK SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU. TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. Y. THINK I THINK IT'S ON THIS IS SUCH A COMPLEX TOPIC IN EACH ONE OF THOSE. ISSUES THAT YOU BROUGHT UP REALLY DESERVES A REALLY REALLY DEEP DIVE TO REALLY COME UP WITH. WITH HOW WE COULD HOW WE COULD MOVE PAST THOSE AND SO IT'S KIND OF BEYOND THE PURVIEW OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE IN MY OPINION BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AS YOU SAY. OUT O WE. THAT TO THAT THE GOAL IS THAT. AS WE AS WE MOVE YOU KNOW THROUGH THESE. THROUGH THESE CHALLENGES THAT WE GET THE INFORMATION WE NEED TO ALLOW US TO CONTINUE OUR DOWN THE ROAD. THIS I DON'T. DISAGREE COMMENT. I WANT TO THANK YOU BOTH FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AS WELL AS ALL THE WORK YOU DID FOR THE SELECT COMMITTEE WE WOULDN'T BE WHERE WE ARE TODAY AND WITH AN AUDIENCE LIKE WE HAVE TODAY BECAUSE OF. THE CHANGES AND THINGS THAT WE WANT TO CHIP AWAY AT. FIRST WHAT YOU LISTEN TO THIS IN THE PUBLIC. YOU ARE FOLLOWING UP. BUT THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IT'S A TOUGH ROAD NOW I AM CONFIDENT THAT. YOU'LL HELP US LEAD US DOWN THAT WAY WITH AND. COMMITTEE THAT IS SPOT ON SO. AS THE GENTLEMAN SAID THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AS WE WENT THROUGH OTHER BILLS IN THE PAST ON UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE. AND BOYS FEAR WHO WOULD BE LEFT BEHIND AND HOPEFULLY BY THIS ADVISORY COMMITTEE WE WILL LEAVE ANYONE BEHIND. DOCTORS WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. I JUST LIKE TO SAY. FOR SMALL THANK YOU CAPTAIN PRESENT THE BILL IN THIS THIS WILL NOT AS SOME MAY CLAIM. THE ROAD TO NOWHERE. IT'S NOT A DELAY TACTIC. WHAT IT IS IS WHAT WE BELIEVE IS THE RESPONSIBLE AND THOUGHTFUL WAY TO ADDRESS A MULTIFACETED SYSTEM? THAT HAS MANY MOVING PARTS. AND ONE THAT HOLDS A HEALTH CARE OF ALL CALIFORNIANS IN ITS HANDS. SUCCESS IN THE END WILL BE THE CREATION OF A SUSTAINABLE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES QUALITY. AND AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE TO EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA. I RISK WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.

ALTHOUGH I DO WANT TO SAY JUST FOR THE RECORD WE DID LOSE A NUMBER OF WITNESSES WHO ARE HERE TODAY AND I DO WANT REFLECT THAT FOR THE. FOR THE REQUISITE NUMBER OF MOMS WHO ARE HERE WHO DID END UP HAVING TO LEAVE SO I FOR THE RECORD I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THING. IT'S NOTED THAT THEY WERE THERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL FISHING. I BEFORE I BEGIN I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS REFLECTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN A STAFF OF FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THIS BILL I LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION. TO ADDRESS ANY REMAINING CONCERNS MATERNAL DEPRESSION IS THE MOST COMPLICATED MOST COMMON COMPLICATION OF PREGNANCY IN THE UNITED STATES SURPASSING SURPASSING JUST ADDITIONAL DIABETES AND PREECLAMPSIA COMBINED. MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS INCLUDING DEPRESSION ANXIETY AND THE MUCH MORE RARE BUT VERY SERIOUS POSTPARTUM PSYCHOSIS AFFECT ONE IN FIVE WOMEN. DURING PREGNANCY OR THE FIRST YEAR FOLLOWING CHILDBIRTH. IT PRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT EARLY RASTA PROPER CHILD DEVELOPMENT THE MOTHER INFANT MONT AND THE FAMILY. ADDITIONALLY MATERNAL DEPRESSION HAS BEEN CONSISTENTLY LINKED WITH CHILDREN'S PARK COGNITIVE OUTCOME. A RECENT STUDY BY UC SAN DIEGO INDICATED THAT HIGHLY DEPRESSED MOTHERS PROVIDE LESS EMOTIONAL SUPPORT TO THEIR CHILDREN ACROSS ALL AGES WHICH RELATED TO CHILDREN'S LOWER AYE CUES. SCREENING AND TREATMENT FOR MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO PROTECT CHILDREN FROM THE POTENTIAL ADVERSE PHYSICAL. AND DEVELOPMENTAL EFFECTS OF THESE CONDITIONS AB TWENTY ONE NINETY THREE WILL REQUIRE OBGYN IS TO SCREEN PREGNANT PATIENTS FROM ETERNAL MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS. AND DURING THE PERINATAL PERIOD SOME MAY ARGUE THAT SCREENING TAKES TOO MUCH TIME AND WE'VE HEARD WE'VE EVEN HEARD THAT IT'S. IF A MOM IS ASKED ABOUT HER FEELINGS SHE COULD BE IN TEARS TOO LONG. FOR THAT THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES ARE NOT ENOUGH BUT HOW CAN THIS BE A JUSTIFICATION TO A FATHER LIKE RUDY CORONADO WHO YOU WILL HEAR FROM SHORTLY. MISTER CORONADO LOST THREE DAUGHTERS UNDER THREE YEARS OLD WHEN HIS WIFE TOOK THE LIVES OF THEIR CHILDREN AFTER SUFFERING AN UNDIAGNOSED CASE OF POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION AND PSYCHOSIS. ADD PAGET IS ANOTHER FATHER THE MUST HIS GRANDSON SHANE AND HIS DAUGHTER CHARLENE WHO WAS NOT SCREENED FOR MATERNAL DEPRESSION HER CONDITION WAS DISCOVERED BY HER HUSBAND AND MOTHER A LITTLE TOO LATE. CHARLIE TOOK HER OWN LIFE AND THE LIFE OF HER SON SHANNON A FEW DAYS PRIOR TO AN APPOINTMENT HER FAMILY SOUGHT FOR HER FIGHT PSYCHIATRIST. ALTHOUGH MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS FORM THE MOST COMMON COMPLICATION OF PREGNANCY IMPACTING ROUGHLY A HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIA WOMEN AND FAMILIES EACH YEAR. THEY ARE ALSO THE MOST UNDER DIAGNOSED COMPLICATION IN AMERICA ADDITIONALLY CALIFORNIA HAS RECENTLY EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT UPWARD TREND IN HOSPITALIZATION OF PREGNANT WOMEN WHAT THE MENTAL HEALTH. HEALTH DIAGNOSES ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS SCREENING MOTHERS FROM ETERNAL DEPRESSION IS A PAST PRACTICE FOR PRIMARY CARE PEDIATRICIANS IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE AMERICAN CONGRESS OF OBSTETRICIANS AND GYNECOLOGISTS. A COG RECOMMENDED THAT CLINICIANS SCREEN PATIENTS AT LEAST ONCE DURING THAT PERINATAL PERIOD. THE UNITED STATES PREVENTIVE TASK FORCE ALSO RECOMMENDS DEPRESSION SCREENING FOR PREGNANT AND POSTPARTUM WOMEN. THE CALIFORNIA TASK FORCE ON MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH IN WHICH A CAUSE AND THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS PARTICIPATED PRESENTED REPORT TO THE. CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE THAT SET A GOAL TO REACH AND EIGHTY PERCENT SCREENING RIGHT BY ABSTRACT. ABSTRACT PROVIDERS BY THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE THIS BILL WILL AID IN ACHIEVING THAT GOAL. AB TWENTY ONE NINETY THREE WILL ADDRESS THESE PREVENTABLE AND TREATABLE DISORDERS THAT ARE SIMPLY FOLLOWING. FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS WITH ME TO TESTIFY TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. OUR VENDOR RARE ANY TO SAY OBGYN AND RUDY CORONADO A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT WHO LOST HIS FAMILY DUE TO MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION KELLY O'CONNOR QUE REPRESENTING THE CO SPONSORS TWENTY TWENTY MOM AND MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH NOW. IS ALSO AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. PLEASE GO AHEAD FOR SWEETNESS. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME I'M HERE TODAY TO SHARE AS A BOARD CERTIFIED OBGYN AND MATERNAL FETAL. MEDICINE SPECIALIST THAT IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DETECT AND ENSURE TREATMENT FOR MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH DISORDER SUCH AS POST PARTUM DEPRESSION. AB TWENTY ONE NINETY THREE WILL ENSURE THAT MY COLLEAGUES PRIORITIZE THIS URGENT MATTER. AND HAVE A SYSTEM OF SUPPORT TO DO SO. THE BILL COMES OUT OF THE CALIFORNIA TASK FORCE ON MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH THE TASK FORCE WAS FORMED AT THE URGING OF THE LEGISLATOR THROUGH ACR ONE FORTY EIGHT. MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS PARTICIPATED INTO INCLUDING THREE OBGYN THIS AND THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS. THE REPORT NOTES THAT IN CALIFORNIA TWENTY PERCENT OF WOMEN WILL SUFFER FROM A MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS SUCH AS POST PARTUM DEPRESSION. AND ROUGHLY FIFTY PERCENT OF LOW INCOME MOTHERS WILL SUFFER JUST DUE TO INCREASE STRESSORS. THINK ABOUT THOSE NUMBERS JUST FOR A MINUTE. RESEARCH UNFORTUNATELY SHOWS THAT THESE DISORDERS. ARE NOT BEING DETECTED AND TREATED. DETECTION STARTS WITH HAVING PATIENTS COMPLETE A QUICK SURVEY. THAT HAS BEEN CONFIRMED OTHER VALIDATED SCREENING TOOL BY RESEARCHERS. THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF STUDIES SHOWING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SCREENING TO DETECT THESE DISORDERS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF EARLY AND EFFECTIVE TREATMENT. YET THE SCREENING RATES REMAIN LOW. AND I BELIEVE THAT ONE OF THE REASONS THESE ARE LOW NUMBERS COMES FROM A LACK OF APPROPRIATE REFERRAL. THAT WE HAVE TO REFER TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SPECIALIST ONCE WE SUSPECT THAT THERE IS A MENTAL HEALTH DISORDER. RESEARCHERS LONG CONFIRMED UNTREATED MATERNAL DEPRESSION LEADS TO TREATMENT RESISTANT DEPRESSION AND IMPACTS FAMILY STABILITY. AS I TELL ALL MY PATIENTS IF MOMS ARE IN A GOOD PLACE THE FAMILY ISN'T IN A GOOD PLACE. IT'S ALSO CRITICAL BUT YOU KNOW THAT HUNDREDS OF STUDIES CONFIRM NEGATIVE CHILD OUTCOMES WHEN THESE DISORDERS ARE LEFT UNTREATED ONE ENTRY TO DURING PREGNANCY THERE'S A HIGHER RISK OF ADVERSE PREGNANCY OUTCOMES INCLUDING LOW BIRTH WEIGHT INFANTS. AND PRETERM BIRTH. THE WORST FAMILY OUTCOME IS STUFF IN THOSE SUICIDE IS RARE IT IS KNOWN TO BE THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IN THE PERINATAL PERIOD. IN THE CASE OF PSYCHOSIS A STATE WHEN A MOTHER HAS A BREAK IN REALITY SHE ALSO HAS A HIGHER RISK OF HARMING HER CHILD. AB TWENTY ONE NINETY THREE REQUIRES WILL BE PROVIDERS TO SCREEN AND FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES TO PROVIDE US WITH SUPPORT BY DEVELOPING A QUALITY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. THE HEALTH CRISIS IS NEGATIVELY IMPACTING MY PATIENTS CALIFORNIA'S FAMILIES AND OUR SOCIETY. SIR. DIFFICULT MA'AM EXITING SIR. I THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY OF SPEAKING TO USE POWERFUL PEOPLE. WHEN I WAS RUDY CORONADO. I LOST MY FAMILY TO THIS HORRIBLE DISEASE. BY WIFE WAS A GOOD WOMAN.

WITH THE BILL RIGHT SPENCER WITH THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY. NINE. WE HAD A OF POSITION HERE PRESENT BUT YOU HAVE HAD A CALLED UNEXPECTEDLY SO. I WILL TRY DO MY BEST ARTICULATE HIS WORDS. I'VE. WE I REGRET WE HAVE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL. THE FIRST LIKE TO THANK MR MANGE I'VE TAKEN ON THIS ISSUE. A IT'S A IT'S A BIG ONE AND A LOT OF A ONE. IN I COULDN'T SAY I SAY THAT WITH CERTAINTY THAT A COG AGREES WITH. HIS AND THE WITNESSES VIEWS TOWARD SCREENING. A COG. IS THE STANDARD OF CARE FOR OPG Y. HANDS TO SCREEN THEIR PATIENTS. A CUT GUIDELINES SUGGEST AT LEAST ONCE DURING PERINATAL PERIOD FOR DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS THERE SHOULD BE A SCREENING. MOST OBGYN SCREEN OF EVEN MORE I'M ONCE BEFORE ONCE AFTER. AND THAT'S JUST THE MINIMUM OF WHAT THEY DO I THINK WHERE THE PROBLEM WE HAVE AND FRANKLY THE ONLY PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE WITH THIS BILL. NOT THE TEN AND ALL IS THE FACT THAT IT'S A MANDATE ON ONE SCREEN. WHEN YOU OF MANDATE MEDICAL GUIDELINES IN STATUTE BECOME STATIC AND THAT'S HOW MEDICAL GUIDELINES SHOULD OPERATE. MEDICAL GUIDELINES ARE FLUID ON YOU STUDY YOU EMPLOYMENT AND THEN YOU GO FROM THERE AND THEN YOU STUDY YOU UP WHEN YOU GO FROM THERE. AYE YEAH I WILL ADMIT EVEN THE. SCREENING THAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT HERE THAT IS A CALL GUIDELINES ON THE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE MAY HOLD AND SO. THAT IS THE PREMISE OF OUR POSITION ON THIS BILL. AND WE DO LOOK FOR TO WORK WITH MR MAIENSCHEIN ON THIS ISSUE AND HELP TO TRY TO IMPROVE THE RESOURCES FOR THESE PATIENTS BUT THEY NEED AN APPROPRIATE TREATMENT. BUT UNTIL THEN AND AS LONG AS A MANDATE IS IN THE BILL AYE WE REGRETTABLY HAVE TO OPPOSE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M JENNIFER WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS AND WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. ON THIS BILL CREATES A CONDITION SPECIFIC CARVE OUT UNDER EXISTING AT COVERAGE FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. HEALTH PLANS STRONGLY AGREE WITH A CRITICAL VALUE OF DELIVERY HEALTH SERVICES FOR POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION. AND CURRENTLY COVER MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. I INCLUDING POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION. THE TO BURP ACCOUNT FOR ANY HEALTH BENEFITS REVIEW HALF PROGRAM REPORT INDICATES THAT A HUNDRED PERCENT OF HEALTH PLAN IN ROWLEY'S HAVE COVERAGE TO MENTAL HEALTH SCREENINGS. DURING THE PRENATAL AND POSTPARTUM PERIODS. HOWEVER THIS BILL GOES MUCH FURTHER THAN THAT. AND IT THAT REQUIRE MUCH OPPOSE GOES MUCH FURTHER THAN CURRENT PRACTICE BY REQUIRING HEALTH PLANS TO PROVIDE AND CASE MANAGEMENT AND OR QUALITY REPORTING THAT'S MENTIONED IN THE AMENDMENTS. REGARDING POSTPARTUM CARE. DEVELOPING AN ENTIRE NEW MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR ONE CATEGORY OF SERVICE. WILL COULD NOT CONSTITUTE AN EXTREME BURDEN AND INCREASED COSTS FOR HEALTH PLANS. WHICH UNFORTUNATELY IS FACTORED INTO PREMIUMS ON IN THIS JUST ISN'T A YEAR. THAT WE WANT TO SEE PREMIUM INCREASES OCCURRING. I'M IN OR ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT. ACCESS TO THE NETWORK REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE OUR SPECIFIC REFERENCE TO PROVIDER TYPES WITHIN THE BILL. SO I APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS OF A REAL ISSUE THAT EXIST WITHIN OUR STATE. WERE VERY I'M SENSITIVE TO THE IMPACT OF HIS DISEASES HAVE ON. A WOMEN IN THAT WITNESSES THAT WE'VE HEARD PROVIDING TESTIMONY TODAY. WE'VE HAD NUMEROUS CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE IN THE SPONSORS AND WE APPRECIATE. THAT THOSE. CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAVE AND WHAT FOR CONTINUING THEM. I DO KNOW THAT NEXT MONTH THOSE MENTAL HEALTH HELP HEALTH AWARENESS MONTH. WE'VE HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS ABOUT EDUCATING IN REDUCING THE STIGMA FOR POST PART OF TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR WOMEN TO ACCESS THE CARE THAT'S CURRENTLY. THEY HAVE COVERAGE FOR THROUGH THEIR HEALTH PLAN PREMIUMS. WELL WE'RE JUST NOT SURE THAT THIS IS THE A NEW BENEFIT MANDATES IS EXACTLY. OF THE APPROPRIATE WAY TO GO. FOR SPECIFIC DISEASE CARVE OUT SINCE WE COVER ALL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION STEPHANIE LICHENS ON THE OF THIS ISSUE XIN CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE. BE SUPPOSED. IF. MICHELLE BACO THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WE ARE IN OPPOSE MUST AMENDED THANK YOU. SHERRI MCCUE REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE ARE OPPOSING THE CEMENTED LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHORED ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS WITH THE COST OF THIS BILL COULD ADD TO THE SYSTEM THANK YOU. MARIN HIGGINS REPRESENTING AMERICA'S HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS IN OPPOSITION. JERRY HICKS REPRESENTING THAT CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS WE ARE OPPOSE MUST AMENDED AND I WOULD ASSOCIATE MCOT COMMENTS WITH. RIGHT SPENCER'S. CONCERNS THEY ARE THE SAME THANK YOU. PREFECTURE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. WALDRON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF. I. SUPPORT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THIS BILL THAT I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS. MAYBE I COULD START WITH THE OPPOSITION JUST FOR CLARIFICATION. SOME OF THE ISSUES INVOLVED. YEAH THE MOM HAS ONE TYPE OF INSURANCE THE CHILD MIGHT BE COVERED UNDER ANOTHER. THIS DIFFERENT KINDS OF. YOU KNOW COVERAGES. HOW WOULD THIS BILL AFFECT? THAT. AS FAR AS NAVIGATING YOU KNOW RECOVERED. THAT'S VERY QUESTION I THINK THAT THE COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS WOULD DEPEND ON WHO'S DOING THE SCREEN SPECIFICALLY IF THE SPELL WAS. AND ACTED AND THE PEDIATRICIAN AND PROVIDED THE SCREEN AND I DURING THE PEDIATRIC VISIT FOR THE CHILD AND IDENTIFIED THAT THE MOTHER WAS SUFFERING FROM POSTPARTUM. IF THE MOTHER OF THE CHILD WERE UNDER DIFFERENT INSURANCE PERHAPS THE FATHER OR ANOTHER PARENT. PROVIDED THE CHILD'S INSURANCE AND THE MOTHER WAS ON HER OWN. THAT HOW THE CASE MANAGEMENT WOULD GO BETWEEN A PEDIATRICIAN WHO TO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CARE OF THE MOTHER AND FOR THE TREATING MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER IN TWO DIFFERENT SYSTEMS I'M NOT SURE HOW THOSE WOULD INTERACT. I DO KNOW THAT THE HEALTH PLAN WITH THE CHILD'S INSURANCE WILL BE COVERING. YOU NO THE PEDIATRIC ISIT AND THE MOTHER'S HEALTH INSURANCE WOULD BE COVERING THE MOTHER'S MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. BUT HOW THOSE TWO WOULD BE MANAGED IF YOU HAD TWO DIFFERENT PROVIDERS NOT NECESSARILY WITH ONE INSURANCE COMPANY. HOW THE CASE MANAGEMENT COORDINATION WOULD WORK IS A QUESTION THAT WE WE HAVE AS WELL? SO DOES THE BILL REQUIRE THE OBGYN TO DO THE INITIAL POST PARTUM. SCREENING. OKAY. BUT THEN LATER THEY ALWAYS GO FOR THE WELL BABY. SO. DOES A COVER THAT TOO I MEAN BECAUSE THERE'S A PROGRESSION. YOU KNOW I I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF SORT OF. MAYBE THIS IS ALL ABOUT APPLES AND ORANGES THAT YOU'RE I THINK YOU'RE ASKED ABOUT INSURANCE COVERAGE ISSUE AND THIS ISN'T THIS IS NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS THIS IS A SCREENING AND SHE'LL. BE OBG. DOWN THE ROAD WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IN TERMS OF TREATMENT. YEAH THAT'S ABOUT IT IS THAT THAT AS A PROBLEM BUT THAT'S AN ONGOING PROBLEM THAT WOULD BE SEPARATE FROM MY DEL THERE ISN'T ENOUGH TREATMENT WE GOING TO THAT AND WE WE HAVE. BUT THIS IS THIS IS SIMPLY ABOUT THE SCREEN. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW. THE NUMBER I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BECAUSE HONEST I WANT ONE I'M TRYING TO GET TO THESE QUESTIONS SO THAT MAYBE WE COULD WORK SOMETHING OUT AS THIS GOES. IN UP TO BURBS SAYING THAT HUNDRED PERCENT OF ENROLLEES WITH HEALTH INSURANCE RIGHT NOW. HAVE COVERAGE FOR MENTAL HEALTH SCREENINGS DURING PRENATAL POST PARTUM PERIOD. SO. BUT YOU KNOW A PART OF THE. THE ISSUE IS. YOU KNOW YOU GO FOR WELL BABY VISIT NOW YOU'RE NOT WITH AN OBGYN IT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT SCENARIO. YOU DON'T WANT TO. MISS THAT COVERAGE IS I MEAN THAT HAS TO BE WORKED OUT I THINK IS. THAT SORT OF JUST YEAH IT AT TEN MS WHAT WE'VE WE HAVE WORKED IN AYE I THINK AS MR SPENCE AND OTHERS WOULD ATTEST WE HAVE WE HAVE HAD COUNTLESS MEETINGS ON THIS AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT'S I THINK. MOST OF YOUR QUESTIONS WILL BE ABLE TO GET ANSWERED I WOULD SAY THOUGH IT I THINK THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COVERAGE ISSUE. AND SCREEN THIS THIS STILL REFERS TO SCREEN. SO AS AS COVERAGE MAY PROGRESS IN TERMS OF TREATMENT OF A MAMA WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE BABY THAT. THAT'S NOT WHAT'S ENTAILED WITHIN THE PARAMETERS OF THIS BILL THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK THIS COMMITTEE SHOULD ADDRESS. BUT IT'S NOT THAT'S GOING TO BE ADDRESSED WAY THROUGH THIS VEHICLE ONE. OF THE OTHER THING I HAD WAS FOURTEEN STATES HAVE ALREADY PASSED LAWS RELATING. SIMILAR. BUT THERE'S DIFFERENT WON SOME OF THEM EDUCATION MANDATE. SCREENING MANDATES. POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS WITH JUST VERY CRITICAL. HAS TO BE IN THE TASK FORCE WAS TO LOOK AT. SO. WE'RE LOOKING AT THE SCREENING MANDATES. AND. WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN AS FAR AS OTHER STATES THAT HAVE DONE SCREENING MANDATES HOW THAT HAS WORK OR NOT WORK? JOY BURKHARD I WAS WITH THE MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH TASK FORCE THAT ISSUED THE REPORT. THAT I THINK EACH OF OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE RECEIVED A COPY OF LAST YEAR A IT IS THE TASK FORCE FUNCTION MUCH LIKE A BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION. IT WAS A CALLED FOR BY ACR ONE FORTY EIGHT THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS. SPONSORED THAT RESOLUTION THE REPORT WAS ISSUED LAST YEAR AND HERE AT THE LEGISLATURE AND. IT DOCUMENT SOME OF THE WORK THAT OTHER STATES HAVE DONE. THIS WORK HERE IN CALIFORNIA I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT EVERYONE KNOWS OF HAS BEEN IN THE WORKS FOR ROUGHLY TEN YEARS. RESOLUTIONS AWARENESS RESOLUTIONS CAMP AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS ALL THOSE THINGS HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED NOT PUBLICLY FUNDED YET. AND THERE IS ANOTHER BILL THAT. THAT A BRAIN MAIENSCHEIN IS ALSO ADDRESSING THE PUBLIC HEALTH. A FUNDING BILL FEDERAL FUNDS BILL WHICH WE HOPE WILL ADDRESS A PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN AS WELL. ON THE REPORT CALLS FOR THE URGENT NEED TO SCREEN. SCREEN WOMEN SO THESE STORIES DON'T KEEP HAPPENING IT'S A STARTING PLACE WE KNOW IT'S A. VERY COMPLEX PROBLEM THAT THERE'S MULTIPLE PLAYERS THAT CAN AND TAKE A ROLL. THE REPORT ACKNOWLEDGES THE CRITICAL ROLE OF THE OBGYN IN SCREENING FOR THESE DISORDERS BECAUSE THEY CAN OCCUR AS FREQUENTLY DURING PREGNANCY. NOT JUST IN THE POST PARTUM WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT OFTEN WE ALSO KNOW A LOT OF WOMEN WILL SUFFER FROM A DEPRESSION OR ANXIETY. BEFORE THEY GET PREGNANT THESE DISORDERS WHEN LEFT UNTREATED CAN LEAD TO PRETERM BIRTH WHICH WE NO COST THE STATE. THOUSAND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON AND IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT OBGYN SERVICE THE HOME BASE. NO OTHER DOCTOR SHOULD NOT ON SCREEN SO DOCTOR SHOULD SCREEN OTHER SHOULD AS WELL BUT O. BITCOINS MUST BE THE HOME BASE AND THAT'S OF KNOWLEDGE IN THIS REPORT. STILL MY LAST QUESTION IS THERE A BEST PRACTICE PROTOCOL. CURRENTLY ON WELL CHILD VISITS. IS THAT PART OF WHAT. A PEDIATRICIAN IS LOOKING AT. YEAH AND IF I COULD. BRIAN IF WE COULD MENTION ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE LOOKING OUT ITS TO HAVE OBGYN SCREEN AND PERHAPS DROP THE SCREENING MANDATE ON OTHER PROVIDERS WE WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE. THAT FIRST TIME. SO AT YOUR QUESTION ABOUT PEDIATRICIANS. MCMURRAY. PEDIATRICIANS BUT VERY VERY ST ASSOCIATIONS HAVE COME OUT WITH POSITIONS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF SCREENING PEDIATRICIANS ARE VERY INTERESTED IN THIS. THIS I'M WORK BECAUSE UNTREATED DEPRESSION NEGATIVELY IMPACTS AS YOU HAVE HEARD CHILD DEVELOPMENT. SEWED PEDIATRICIANS ARE INTERESTED THERE NOT THE MOTHERS DR WHICH IS WHY OBGYN SO CALLED OUT AS BEING CRITICALLY IMPORTANT OBGYN SCAN PRESCRIBE CREATE. TREATMENT. PATHWAYS SIX CETERA THAT'S NOT THE ROLE OF THE PEDIATRICIAN AT THE DOCTOR OF THE BABY OR THE INFANT NOT THE THE MOTHER. DOES I HOPE. RIGHT. SO THEY HAVE A BEST PRACTICE PROTOCOL THAT THEY YEAH AND SO DOES A COG THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF OBSTETRICS AND GOING GYNECOLOGY AND TOOLS ARE BEING ISSUED BY A CAUGHT. UP AS WE SPEAK. LEADER THE SURE THEY'LL BE MULTIPLE TOOLS THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE THROUGH AN EXPERT WORKGROUP WHICH ON SEVERAL OF US RUN THE TASK FORCE HAVE A PRIVILEGE TO SIT ON. THANK YOU I I'M. YOU KNOW LOOKING FORWARD TO SEE HOW THIS EVOLVES BECAUSE. THE WAY THE HEALTH PLANS. WORK ON THAT NOW. IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN HOW YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IT AND I'M. CURIOUS TO SEE HOW THIS COMES TOGETHER. ON BECAUSE THEY MAY BE. AWAY TO DO WHAT YOU WANNA DO. THAT MAYBE COULD BE WORKABLE AND I DON'T KNOW BUT. THAT LIST. WHY WAS SAYING THAT ON THE RECORD? OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEN MUCH SEEN OBJECT CLOSENESS BUT MAY I WOULD. JUST A COUPLE JUST A COUPLE QUICK RESPONSES ON. THE TASK FORCE. THAT. ACT ACTUALLY THAT THE. SOME OPPONENTS PARTICIPATED AND DECLARED. THAT OBSTETRIC PROVIDERS OF THE HOME BASE FOR SCREENING AND TREATMENT AND RECOMMENDED THAT WOMEN ARE SCREEN THROUGHOUT THE PREGNANCY IN THE IMMEDIATE POST PARTUM. PERIOD AND IT ALSO URGED HEALTH INSURERS TO ASSIST OBG Y. ANTS WITH ONGOING PATIENT CARE OVERSIGHT MANAGEMENT THAT WAS PRESENTED. PARTICIPATE IN AND PRESENTED TO THIS LEGISLATURE AS PART OF A SOLUTION TO POST PARTUM DEPRESSION. I WOULD ALSO SAY TO YOU IN TERMS OF THE STANDARD OF CARE. THIS IS THE STANDARD. SCREEN IS. THAT IS HOW YOU GET OUT THE STANDARD OF CARE. AND SO WELL IN SOME SENSE I UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS SAID ABOUT THEIR NOT FLUID. HOW ARE THEY ARE THEY ARE FLUID WHERE I WOULD DISAGREE AS TO ASK ARE NOT FLUID IN THE SENSE THAT THEY'RE ON AN AD? BASIS. DATE WE SET THINGS AND LAW. AND THEN IF THIS AS THE STATE OF SCIENCE ADVANCES IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE MASSES THAT LONG MAY CHANGE BUT WE DON'T JUST HAVE ADHOC. EVERYBODY DO WHAT THEY WANT THAT'S ACCORDING TO THEIR VERSION OF REALITY SO WITH THIS I MEAN I THINK YOU SAW FROM THE TESTS MY HERE TODAY AND FOR THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE HERE MANY MORE WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE HERE THIS IS. THIS IS A REALLY SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM WE TALK ABOUT ADDRESSING MENTAL HEALTH MANY TIMES IN THIS LEGISLATURE THIS IS A LARGE COME. OF. AND I WOULD STRONGLY. URGE AND AYE VOTE AND REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. I FROM THIS COMMITTEE THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU MR MAIENSCHEIN AND I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND APPRECIATE YOUR WITNESSES AND. AND THE TESTIMONY AND THANK YOU FOR. COMING INTO THAT WAS VERY% DIFFICULT AND. I'D VERY MUCH APPRECIATE WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. THE BILL DOES ENJOY A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS. I'M NOT THRILLED ABOUT THEM. IN THE AND MANDATING THINGS ON PROVIDERS. HOWEVER I THINK. I THINK WE NEED TO MESSAGE OUT THERE AND CLEARLY. IT'S NOT HAPPENING TO A CERTAIN TO A CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PEOPLE OUT THERE AND. THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES FOR THAT AND WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT AND SO I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THAT NO FORWARD. AND AS I SAID IT DOES ENJOY DO PASS RECOMMENDATION AND AND I KNOW YOU WILL BE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK ON THIS SO ASK MADAM SECRETARY. PLEASE CALL THE ROSES DO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS. AND I. CARE MEMBER WHO MADE MOTIONS BUT THEY WERE GREAT MOTIONS. AND DON'T HAVE THIS AGUIAR-CURRY AND. AND MISS PERFECT SO THANK YOU. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. WOULD I WOULD I MAYES. MAYES BOMBARDING AGUIAR-CURRY. BIGELOW. BIGELOW NOT VOTING WANT. SIR. TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES. YOU COULD YOU CAN ACCEPT MR MAIENSCHEIN.

GET THE PAPER GET THE DOOR CLOSED THEREIN OKAY WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD GET STARS TO LOOK DIFFERENT THAN OUR NORMAL COMMITTEE PRESENTATION WE ALLOW EACH EACH SIDE TO PERCENT FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES TOTAL. SO EVERYONE SPLIT UP. SO. AND THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE YOU MISTER KALRA. I REGRET I REGRET THAT FOR THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS BUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO START OFF BY THANKING THE CHAIR IN HIS PERSONAL AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR TIRELESS. EFFORTS ON THIS BILL. AND WORKING WITH ME. I APPRECIATE THE WORK AND EFFORT I'M GRATEFUL FOR ALL THE TIME YOU PUT INTO THIS MEASURE AND ALSO LIKE TO COMMEND THE WORK OF THIS COMMITTEE AND MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE. WHICH ARE NUMEROUS HEARINGS THROUGHOUT THE STATE HEARING FROM EXPERTS STAKEHOLDERS AND THE PUBLIC ON THE IMPORTANT DISCUSSION. ON HOW TO EXPAND ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE WHILE CONTROLLING COSTS. THOSE HEARINGS ARE CRITICAL TO GETTING A. B. THIRTY EIGHTY SEVEN TO WHERE WE ARE NOW AND I TRULY APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP. SECONDLY I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THEIR STAFF FOR THEIR TIME QUESTION ASKS. AND CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED. THE AMENDMENTS WE HAVE MADE AND THOSE PROPOSED AS AUTHOR AMENDMENTS IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS ARE REFLECTIVE OF HOW WE HAVE WORKED TO RESPOND TO AN ADDRESSES MANY OF THE QUESTIONS. AND CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED TO DATE. BOPPING IS HEADED OUT A MATRIX WHICH HAS. TWELVE SUBSTANCE OR BLEVINS SUBSTANTIVE AMENDMENTS WE'VE TAKEN PLUS FOR COMMERCE OF COMMITTEE POLICY COMMENTS THAT WERE ALSO GOING TO BE. INCORPORATING AS AMENDMENTS AS THIS BILL IT WERE TO MOVE FORWARD. WOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE BILL AS WELL SO FIFTEEN TOTAL SUBSTANTIVE AMENDMENTS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE PROCESS OF WORKING ON AN IMPROVING THE BILL. OF WITH THAT. WELL GLAD I'LL GLADLY ACCEPT AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS ALL THE POLICY COMMENTS AS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. AND A MOCK UP IN TABLE SUMMARY AS MENTION IS BEING DISTRIBUTED FOR OF ALL OF YOU TO REVIEW. OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS CALIFORNIA HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES IN INCREASING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE WHY ARE UNINSURED POPULATIONS DROPPED. BY NEARLY HALF. HOWEVER. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE MADE TREMENDOUS STRIDES IN INCREASING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE MANY CONTINUE TO FOREGO NEEDED MEDICAL TREATMENT BECAUSE OF THE CONTINUED YOUR BY YOUR INCREASES AND HEALTHCARE COSTS. HEALTHCARE HAS BECOME FAR TOO EXPENSES AND IF IT CONTINUES WILL BECOME UNSUSTAINABLE NOT JUST FOR THOSE WITHOUT INSURANCE. BUT ALSO FOR THOSE WITH IT. NOT ONLY DOES IT IMPACT THE STATE'S ABILITY TO FUND IMPORTANT PRIORITIES SUCH AS EDUCATION TRANSPORTATION. AND IS HAVING A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE ABILITY OF CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES TO AFFORD. AN OFFER HEALTHCARE BENEFITS TO THEIR EMPLOYEES. IN FACT OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS STATE BUDGET EXPENDITURES ON HEALTH CARE HAVE INCREASED BY EIGHT PERCENT YEAR OVER. YEAR THE PAST TEN YEARS AND CALIFORNIA'S BUSINESSES ARE INCREASINGLY FOR DON OFFERING THEIR EMPLOYEES HEALTHCARE INSURANCE WERE ONLY FIFTY FIVE PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA COMPANIES. HAVE REPORTED PROVIDING HEALTHCARE INSURANCE TO EMPLOYEES TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WHICH IS DOWN FROM SIXTY NINE PERCENT IN TWO THOUSAND. MOST IMPORTANTLY WE'RE SEEING PEOPLE MAKE SERIOUS AND POTENTIALLY DEBILITATING HELD DECISIONS DUE. TO THE COST OF HEALTHCARE. IN A RECENT REPORT BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO WAS FOUND UP FORTY PERCENT OF AMERICANS SKIPPED A RECOMMENDED MEDICAL TESTS OR TREATMENT. DUE TO COST. WHAT ALL THIS INFORMATION DEMONSTRATES THAT THE CURRENT TRAJECTORY OF HEALTHCARE COSTS IS UNSUSTAINABLE? IT BEGAN TEN YEARS TO GO ON UNADDRESSED IN THAT COULD WELL ACCESS TO CARE WILL WORSEN. HEALTHCARE DISPARITIES WILL INCREASE AND THE DISPROPORTIONATE USE OF MEDICAL CARE BETWEEN THOSE WHO CAN AND CANNOT AFFORD THEIR HEALTHCARE WILL EXPAND. THIS IS WHY I HAVE OP AUTHORED AB THIRTY EIGHTY SEVEN THE HEALTH CARE PRICE RELIEF ACT WHICH WILL ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT HEALTH CARE COST. QUALITY AND EQUITY COMMISSION TO SET REASONABLE BASED AMOUNTS HOSPITALS DOCTORS AND OTHER PROVIDERS OF HEALTHCARE SERVICE CAN COLLECT FROM PARIS. THE ELEVEN MEMBER COMMISSION WOULD BUILD OFF OF WOULD BUILD OFF OF MEDICARE REYES NOT LOWER. THAN A HUNDRED PERCENT DETERMINE PROVIDER BASE AMOUNTS AND I JUST MEDICARE ADVANTAGE REYES TO ESTABLISH A CAPITATED AMOUNT THAT HEALTH PLANS MUST USE AS A BASIS FOR PREMIUMS. BY BUILDING UPON EXISTING MODELS WE CAN ESTABLISH A TRANSPARENT PROCESS BY WHICH INCREASES IN HEALTHCARE COSTS CAN BE KEPT REASONABLE. CONTINUE TO EXPAND ACCESS TO CARE AND PROVIDE OUR HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY WITH THE ABILITY TO RECEIVE A FAIR RETURN ON INVESTMENT. IN DOING SO WE CAN HELP ADDRESS THE LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM BY DRESSING UNREASONABLE AND EGREGIOUS RATES WHILE MAINTAINING ACCESS TO QUALITY CARE FOR ALL. I WANTED ALSO ADDRESS SOME OF THE QUESTIONS WE HAVE REGULARLY HEARD ABOUT THE BILL. SIDE LEGAL HELP TO CLARIFY WHERE CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF GOT LOST IN TRANSLATION OR MISINFORMATION IS ADDED TO THE CONFUSION ABOUT THE BILL. A FREE CONCERNED THAT THERE'S BEEN REYES IS THAT THIS BILL WOULD LET LEAD TO RATIONING OF CARE AND COST POSITIONS TO FLEE THE STATE AND HOSPITALS CLOSE OUR DOORS. THIS IS NOT TRUE RATHER A. B. THIRTY EIGHTY SEVEN WHAT COUNTER WHAT WE ARE ALREADY SEEING IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM TODAY THE RATION OF HEALTHCARE BY THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT. THE MOST AYE DO THE COST OF CARE MANY ARE REGULARLY CHOOSING TO FORGO A NETIQUETTE I NAY A NEEDED MEDICAL. TREATMENT OR TO PAY THE RENT. THE FOOD ON THE TABLE OR PAY THEIR UTILITY BILL. THIS BILL WOULD ENSURE THAT RATES ARE REFLECTIVE OF THE NEED TO MAINTAIN AND EXPAND ACCESS TO NOT JUST QUALITY MEDICAL CARE BUT AFFORDABLE MEDICAL CARE. REGARDING PHYSICIANS AND HOSPITALS WE ARE ALREADY EXPERIENCING A SHORTAGE OF PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS WHO ARE ON THE FRONTLINE OF OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND WATCHING US HOSPITAL'S CONSOLIDATE. AND SHUDDER HEALTHCARE FACILITIES IN THE PROCESS. AS OPPOSED TO OUR CURRENT REALITY ASSAULT RATION HEALTHCARE DUE TO COST AB THIRTY EIGHTY SEVEN WOULD ENSURE THAT PROVIDER RATES ARE TIED TO IMPROVING HEALTH OUTCOMES AND REDUCING HEALTH DISPARITIES. FURTHER AB THIRTY EIGHTY SEVEN ALSO TAKES INTO ACCOUNT WHAT IS NEEDED TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN A QUALIFIED HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE. AND THAT THERE'S A FAIR AND REASONABLE RETURN ON INVESTMENT FOR PROVIDERS. ANOTHER CONCERN WE HAVE HEARD IS THAT THIS BILL DOES NOTHING TO ADDRESS INADEQUATE MEDICAL RATES WHICH ARE A DRIVER OF COST SHIFTING BETWEEN COMMERCIAL AND MEDI CAL RATES. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT RESEARCH THAT DEMONSTRATES THAT COST SHIFTING FROM A MORE CONSERVATIVE VIEWPOINT HAS OCCURRED. ABOUT USUALLY AT A RELATIVELY LOW RATE THE BILL DOES INCLUDE LANGUAGE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE NUMBER OF. NUMBER OF MEDI CAL PATIENTS PROVIDERS SERVE THE FISCAL IMPACT ASSOCIATED AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE RATE AS NECESSARY. LASTLY CONCERN WE HAVE HEARD REGULARLY THIS BILL AS A VEILED ATTEMPT AND MEANT MEDICARE FOR ALL OR TO KEEP RATES AT AT OR NEAR MEDICARE AMOUNTS. THIS IS UNTRUE AND AS AN ARGUMENT THAT I BELIEVE IS MISLEADING A MISREPRESENTATION OF EFFORTS MY OFFICE MADE TO HELP STAKEHOLDERS READ THROUGH THE BILL LANGUAGE. SPECIFICALLY IN ONE OF THE DOCUMENTS WE USED TO HELP STAKEHOLDERS UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENT PROVISIONS WE INCLUDED AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THE MEDICARE RATE CAN BE USED TO DETERMINE PROVIDER MAYES. FOR EXAMPLE WOULD READ THAT RATES COULD BE UNDER TWENTY FIVE PERCENT HUNDRED PERCENT MEDICARE OR HIGHER. HOWEVER SOME MISREPRESENTED THIS AFTER TO STATE THAT THE BILL WOULD SET RATES AT A HUNDRED PERCENT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT MEDICARE AND RESULT IN AN ESTIMATED EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN LOST REVENUE FOR THE OVER. FOREIGNER HOSPITALS IN CALIFORNIA THAT PAYMENT REDUCTIONS WILL NEED AN ESTIMATE A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND. OF HEALTH CARE WORKERS LOSING THEIR JOBS. THAT'S OF OF A HYPOTHETICAL DOES NOT BASED IN FACT AND IT'S INCORRECT AND MISLEADING. RATHER AS MANY OF YOU KNOW MEDICARE RATES ARE OFTEN USED BY POSITIONS HOSPITALS INSURERS TO NEGOTIATE THEIR CONTRACT AND A CONTRACT RAISE. IT IS USED AS THE FOUNDATION UPON WHICH POSITIONS MEDICAL GROUPS HOSPITALS CLINICS HEALTHCARE PLANS AND INSURERS NEGOTIATE THEIR RATES. THIS IS THE SAME APPROACH USED FOR A. B. THIRTY EIGHTY SEVEN ONE THAT DOES NOT SET A PROVIDER RATE CEILING JUST THE OPPOSITE THAT SETS A FLOOR USING EXISTING. MEDICARE RATES I'M NOT LOOKING TO GO BACK AND SET RATES WHERE THEY WERE TWENTY YEARS AGO THIS IS THE PROSPECT OF BILL WHEREBY THE COMMISSION WILL BE LOOKING AT TODAY. AND GOING INTO THE FUTURE. THE NOTION OF THIS ONLY GONNA LEAD TO CUTS IN CURRENT RATES ARE SIMPLY NOT TRUE. AS THE COMMISSION IS REQUIRED TO SET REYES A FAIR MARKET VALUE. AND FOSTER A MORE ACTIVE WILL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS SIMPLY PUT SHARON MEMBERS THE STATUS QUO IS UNACCEPTABLE. AND IF WE MAINTAIN THIS IS THE WAY THE SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY SET UP WE'RE GONNA SEE MORE CALIFORNIANS MORE SMALL BUSINESSES NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD HEALTHCARE AND FRANKLY. BUT THE PROVIDERS THE HOSPITALS THE DOCTORS GOING INTO THE FUTURE THEY WON'T NEED AND DESERVE A SUSTAINABLE SYSTEM TO. AND SO THE THIS BILL SEEKS TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE CAN COME TO THE TABLE AND PROVIDE INPUT TO ENSURE THAT THE RATES THAT ARE SET ARE ONES THAT ARE FAIR TO EVERYONE. BUT THAT DON'T HAVE THESE UNEXPECTED INCREASES THAT REALLY MAKE IT AN UNSUSTAINABLE SYSTEM FOR ALL. WITH THAT I HAVE WITH ME ARE CO SPONSORS FOR A. B. THIRTY EIGHTY SEVEN WILL BE TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. ARE PLASTIC SECRETARY TREASURER FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. CHRIS ROCK PRESIDENT OF UNITE HERE LOCAL FORTY NINE AND TAM MA WITH HEALTH ACCESS THINK RESEARCHER. GERMAN. MEMBERS MY NAME IS ART PULASKI. I'M THE EXECUTIVE SECRETARY TREASURER OF THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. THANK YOU DOCTOR WORD FOR ALL THAT YOU DO. YOU DON'T SEE ME. YOU DON'T OFFICE HE ME HERE GIVING TESTIMONY. BUT HEALTHCARE IS AN ISSUE THAT TOUCHES. ALL OF OUR MEMBERS TWO MILLION OF THEM. AND ALMOST ALL CALIFORNIANS. SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWO. PREMIUMS FOR JOB BASED INSURANCE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE RISEN BY TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR PERCENT. SOMETHING IS VERY WRONG. THIS IS BEFORE THEN LONG BEFORE THEN WE HAVE WORKED HARD EVERY ASPECT OF HEALTH CARE FOR CONSUMERS. TWO THOUSAND THREE. BECAUSE WE SPONSORED ESPY TO THE JOHN BURTON BILL. THAT WOULD CALLED ON ALL EMPLOYERS ALMOST ALL EMPLOYERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO GIVE OUR HEALTH INSURANCE TO THEIR EMPLOYEES. WHO WORKED ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT? HE'S TAKEN ON INSURANCE COMPANIES HEALTH PLANS AND BIG PHARMA. OUR TRUST FUND SAID NEGOTIATE COVERAGE FOR TWO MILLION FAMILIES. CONTINUOUS GREAT FOR WAYS TO CUT COSTS. THROUGH ALL THIS AND MORE WE HAVE LEARNED THE ONLY WAY TO CONTAIN COSTS. IS TO ADDRESS HIGHER PRICES. ACROSS THE BOARD THROUGH THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY. ARE FEDERATION IS A STRONG SUPPORTER OF SINGLE PAYER. S. B. FIVE SIX TWO. AND TO ACHIEVE SINGLE PAYER. WE MUST REDUCE THE COSTS OF MEDICAL CARE. AB THIRTY EIGHTY SEVEN. IS ABOUT SETTING A FAIR AND TRANSPARENT PROCESS FOR HEALTH CARE RATES. RIGHT NOW THOSE PRICES ARE LARGELY CONTROLLED BY MEDICAL MONOPOLIES. ESSENTIALLY THEY CHARGE WHATEVER THEY CAN. WHENEVER THEY CAN. SUTTER HEALTH HERE IN SACRAMENTO IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF THAT. WE HAVE LEARNED THAT THE FREE MARKET SYSTEM. FOR ALL OTHER ESSENTIAL SERVICES. DOES NOT WORK. WE IS CONTROLLED BY MY NOT MONOPOLISTIC PRICE CITY. OF COURSE IT DOESN'T WORK FOR HEALTH CARE EITHER. THOSE PRICES ARE PUSHING HEALTHCARE SYSTEM TO THE BRINK. PUSHING FAMILIES EMPLOYERS ALIKE OVER THE EDGE. EVERY MOMENT WE WAIT MORE FAMILIES WILL BE HEARD. THEY NEED URGENT ATTENTION WE ARE JUNE VOTE YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN WOULD AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS CHRIS RACKING ON THE PRESIDENT OF UNITE HERE LOCAL FORTY NINE. A UNION OF THIRTY SIX HUNDRED HOTEL RESTAURANT A CASINO WORKERS BASED HERE IN SACRAMENTO. OUR MEMBERS ARE THE HOUSEKEEPER'S IN THE BARTENDERS WHO WAIT ON YOU AT THE SHERATON GRAND SACRAMENTO AND TO CITIZEN HOTEL. IS THE COOKS IN THE BOUNCERS WHO SERVE YOU AT THUNDER VALLEY IN CAST CREEK CASINOS. WE ARE UNION OF LOW WAGE WORKERS TO GENERATE PROFITS FOR CORPORATIONS THAT MAKE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR. I'M HERE TODAY REPRESENTING UNITE HERE AND INTERNATIONAL UNION OF TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND HOSPITALITY WORKERS ACROSS THE U. S. AND CANADA. ALONG WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION AS YOU ARE YOU CALIFORNIA THE TEAMSTERS AND HEALTH ACCESS WE ARE CO SPONSORS OF AB THIRTY EIGHTY SEVEN BECAUSE THE INCREASING COST OF HEALTHCARE HAS CREATED A CRISIS THAT THREATENS THE ABILITY. OF MILLIONS OF WORKERS BOTH ARE MEMBERS IN THOSE WITHOUT UNIONS HAVE A SHOT AT MIDDLE CLASS LAUGHS. WE RESET CRISIS POINT AND THINGS CANNOT CONTINUE AS THEY ARE. I'VE BEEN IN SACRAMENTO SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE IN A NEGOTIATED DOZENS OF CONTRACTS WITH HOTEL COMPANIES CORPORATE CAFETERIA FRANCHISEES IN TRIBAL GAMING OPERATORS. REPRESENTING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN WAGES PENSIONS AND HEALTH CARE CONTRIBUTIONS. IN THAT TIME I'VE HAD LIED TO MANY HARD UGLY MEETINGS WITH COURAGEOUS GROUPS OF WORKERS WHO ARE FORCED TO MAKE AN IMPOSSIBLE CHOICE AT THE END OF TOUGH CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS. THEY STRUGGLE TO WIN NINETY CENTS FOR A BUCK FROM THE COMPANY BUT THEY HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO PUT THAT MONEY INTO RAISES OR HEALTH CARE CONTRIBUTIONS. WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO SUPPORT YOUR FAMILY ON TWELVE OR THIRTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR AND PAY FOR HOUSING AND LIVING EXPENSES IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S A REALLY PAINFUL CHOICE. WORKERS ARE FORCED TO PUT LOTS OF THE MONEY THEY WIN IN BARGAINING OFTEN THE MAJORITY OF IT INTO PROTECTING THEIR HEALTH CARE. THIS IS HAPPENING EVERYWHERE IN SAN FRANCISCO HOTELS NOW PAY MORE THAN THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE JUST TO FUND THEIR HOUSEKEEPERS HEALTH CARE. EACH YEAR INSURANCE COMPANIES DEMAND MORE MONEY FOR THE SAME BENEFITS FROM OUR HEALTH CARE TRUST FUNDS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT OUR MEMBERS WENT TO THE HOSPITAL MORE LESS OFTEN IN THE LAST YEAR. INSTEAD OF PUTTING DESPERATELY NEEDED MONEY INTO THE POCKETS OF LOW WAGE WORKERS IF IT OFTEN FEELS LIKE WE'RE TRANSFERRING TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM ONE MULTIBILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY. THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY TO ANOTHER THE MEDICAL INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX AND ALL OF THIS AT THE EXPENSE OF WORKING FAMILIES. AND WHY DOES THE COST OF HEALTH CARE KEEP INCREASING SEVERAL AB THIRTY EIGHTY SEVEN BILL SPONSORS HAVE SPONSORED PREVIOUS LEGISLATION TO MAKE HEALTH CARE COSTS MORE TRANSPARENT. INFORMATION FROM THOSE BILL SHOW THAT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN PREMIUM DOLLAR IS PROJECTED TO GO TO DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS. AND EIGHTY THREE PERCENT OF MEDICAL COST INCREASES LAST YEAR RESULTED FROM PRICE INFLATION. THIS CONFIRMS A CONSENSUS IN THE EXPERT LITERATURE THAT THE CORE PROBLEM WITH HEALTHCARE COSTS IN OUR COUNTRY AND IN CALIFORNIA IS HIGH PRICES. AB THIRTY EIGHTY SEVEN ESTOPPEL PUBLIC POLICY THAT GETS TO THE HEART OF THIS ISSUE WE'RE URGING WHAT MOVIE FOR WITHOUT DELAY THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM TAM MA AND ON THE LEGAL AND POLICY DIRECTOR WITH HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA THE STATE HEALTHCARE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION. WE ARE PROUD TO CO SPONSOR AB THIRTY EIGHTY SEVEN. THE BILL IS CAREFULLY CRAFTED TO ENSURE THE INDUSTRY GETS A FAIR RATE FOR THE SERVICES THEY PROVIDE. THE COMMISSION AND THE BILL WOULD DO THREE THINGS FIRST IT WOULD SET THE BASE RATE. SECOND WOULD HEAR APPEALS AND THIRD SET A GLOBAL BUDGETS. FIRST THE COMMISSION WITHOUT THE BASE RATE FOR DOCTORS HOSPITALS AND HEALTH PLANS USING MEDICARE AS A BENCHMARK. WE CHOSE MEDICARE BECAUSE IT IS A TRIED AND TRUE PROCESS FOR SETTING FARE RATES THAT ARE TRANSPARENT TO EVERYONE. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY MEDICARE DOES NOT ALLOW THE RELATIVE MARKET POWER OF MAJOR HEALTH CARE PLAYERS TO DICTATE PRICES. FOR STATE LICENSED HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS SELLING TO EMPLOYERS AND INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS. THE BILL WOULD USE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE AS THE BASIS FOR PREMIUMS. MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS ARE PRIVATE MEDICARE PLANS LIKE THE ONES OFFERED BY KAISER AND HEALTH NUTS. AB THIRTY EIGHTY SEVEN DOES NOT A DO MANAGED CARE OR VALUE BASED PURCHASING. HEALTH PLANS AND PROVIDERS WOULD CONTINUE TO NEGOTIATE A CONTRACT WITH ONE ANOTHER AND HEALTH PLANS WOULD STILL BE REQUIRED TO HAVE ENOUGH DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS AND THEIR NETWORKS TO GUARANTEE TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE. LAW AS THEY DO TODAY. THE RATE PAID TO HEALTH PLANS WOULD BE ADJUSTED BY AGE. RISK LEX AND OTHER PERMISSIBLE RATING FACTORS BECAUSE PEOPLE IN THEIR THIRTIES USE LESS HEALTH CARE THAT PEOPLE IN THEIR SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES. FOR DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS TO PROVIDE CARE OUTSIDE OF THE CONTRACT WITH THE STATE LICENSE HEALTH PLAN THE BASE RATE WILL BE BASED ON WHAT MEDICARE PAYS PROVIDER WITH ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF MEDICARE AS THE FLOOR. THIS WOULD APPLY TO OUT OF NETWORK CAREAS WELL AS THE CARE THAT SIX MILLION CALIFORNIANS GET FROM THEIR EMPLOYER OR YOU TRUST UP BUT OR YOU TRUST FUND. OFFERING A SELF INSURED PLAN. THE AUTHORS AMENDMENTS TAKEN TODAY ALLOW SUCH PLANS TO OPT IN TO USING THE BASE RATE. USING THE MEDICARE RIGHT BILLS AND A NUMBER OF ADJUSTMENTS FOR GEOGRAPHIC REGION AND PARTICULAR SPECIALTIES. IT ALSO INCORPORATES DIFFERENCES AND LABOR AND ALL OTHER OPERATING COSTS. THE COMMISSION MUST REVEAL ADJUST THE BASE RATES EACH YEAR FOR THE RATES REFLECT CURRENT COSTS AND NEEDS. AND WHAT SETTINGS. THE RACE EACH YEAR THE COMMISSION MUST CONSIDER FACTORS THAT ARE CRITICAL TO ENSURING CALIFORNIA'S CAN ACCESS CARE. SUCH AS MAINTAINING AN ADEQUATE WORKFORCE OF PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTHCARE WORKERS. MAKING SURE PEOPLE IN RURAL AREAS AND UNDERSERVED URBAN AREAS CAN GET CARE. AND CERTAIN THE PROVIDERS ARE GETTING A FAIR RETURN ON INVESTMENT AND CAN STAY FINANCIALLY SOLVENT. AND MAKING SURE THAT THE BASE RATE IS ADJUSTED TO TACKLE EXISTING FUNDING INEQUITIES FOR PROVIDERS THAT RELY ON MEDI CAL. THE SECOND RESPONSIBILITIES THE COMMISSION IS TO CONSIDER APPEALS FROM DOCTORS HOSPITALS AND HEALTH PLANS FOR AMOUNTS HIGHER THAN THE BASE RATE. THEY WOULD NEED TO JUSTIFY WHY A HIGHER RATE AS APPROPRIATE TO ENSURE ACCESS. SUCH AS BUT ANTICIPATED COSTS RESULTING FROM NATURAL DISASTERS OUTBREAKS OF DISEASE AND CHANGES IN LABOR AND CAPITAL COSTS. FINALLY THE THIRD THING THE COMMISSION IS CHARGED WITH DOING IS ESTABLISHING A GLOBAL CAP EACH YEAR SO INCREASES IN OUR OVERALL HEALTH CARE SPENDING TO NOT RISE FASTER THAN INFLATION. THIS IS ALSO WITH THE COMMISSION CAN MONITOR I ANY INCREASES IN VOLUME SPIKES IN SPENDING OR OTHER ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE REMEDIED SO PROVIDERS TO ECONOMIZE. IN WAYS THAT HURT PATIENTS. AB THIRTY EIGHTY SEVEN TACKLES THE PROBLEMS WE SEE IN HEALTH CARE PRICING TODAY WHERE PROVIDER IN HOSPITAL MONOPOLIES CHARGE WHATEVER THEY WANT WITH VERY LITTLE OVERSIGHT. AS CONSUMER ADVOCATES WE WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE MEANINGFUL ASKS US TO CARE AND A LARGE PART OF THAT EQUATION IS LOWERING OVERALL COSTS SO WE CAN SUSTAIN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND MAKE IT WORK FOR EVERYONE. ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS I RESPECTFULLY ASK ME AYE VOTES ON A. B. THIRTY EIGHTY SEVEN. YOU VERY MUCH THIS POINT WILL LAST FOR OTHERS IN SUPPORT. IT WOULD JUST BE HER NAME AND POSITION ONLY. LOOK YOU HAVE TO RUN ITS OKAY. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MICHELLE CABINET I WITH THIS YEAH YOU CALIFORNIA WE ARE PROUD CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL THINK YOU.

BELIEVE I DON'T KNOW IF THE TIME THERE'S STILL A FEW MINUTES OBSERVERS AWARENESS WHICH OUT SOME OF THE WITNESSES WE COULD NOW LAW BOTHER COMING UP OKAY PLEASE WHEN YOU'RE VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM CARMELLA OIL. THE PRESIDENCY OF THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION HERE IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO AB THIRTY EIGHTY SEVEN. WHICH IS A BIG BAD BILL FOR THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIANS. THE PROPONENTS ARGUE THAT THIS BILL WOULD MAKE HEALTHCARE MORE AFFORDABLE AND THEREFORE MORE ACCESSIBLE IN CALIFORNIA. IT DOES NOT AND UNFORTUNATELY THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE. THE BILL AMOUNTS TO HUGE CUTS FOR DOCTORS HOSPITALS DENTISTS AND OTHERS. AND LOST ACCESS TO CARE FOR EVERYONE. BUT THIS BILL DOES NOTHING TO REDUCE THE ACTUAL UNDERLYING COST OF CARE. WHAT I MEAN WHAT DOES THIS BILL DO? IT'S LIKE WALKING INTO A RESTAURANT. HAVING DINNER. GETTING A CHECK FOR TWENTY DOLLARS AND LEADING A TEN DOLLAR BILL ON THE TABLE. THAT TEN DOLLAR BILL PAYING LESS THAN THE CHECK. DOESN'T CHANGE THE COST OF THE MEAL. DOESN'T CHANGE THE WAGES PAID TO THE WAITRESS OR TO THE CHEF. DOESN'T CHANGE THE EXPENSES OCCURRED BY THAT RESTAURANT OWNER. HE SIMPLY IS LEFT WITH HALF THE AMOUNT. THIS BILL CREATES A PROCESS THE ONLY CAPS THE PRICES PAID. TO DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS AND PHYSICIANS AND DENTISTS AND OTHERS AND HEALTH PLANS. IT'S SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T DONE IN THE UNITED STATES SINCE THE NIXON WAGE AND PRICE CONTROLS OF THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES. AND FOR THOSE WHO THINK THIS PROPOSAL. IS ANYTHING LIKE THE RATE SETTING SYSTEM IN MARYLAND HAVING SERVED NINE YEARS AS THE PRESIDENT CEO OF THE MARYLAND HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THAT IS NOT AT ALL THE CASE NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH. THIS BILL DOES NOTHING TO ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING DRIVERS OF HEALTH CARE COSTS NOR DOES IT ACKNOWLEDGED. AND SEPARATE HEALTHCARE SPENDING INCREASES SOME OF THE HEALTHCARE SPENDING INCREASES THAT WE ARE INCURRING. ARE GOOD IT'S THE RESULT OF HAVING COVERED MILLIONS MORE CALIFORNIANS UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT HEALTH CARE SPENDING SOME IS REALLY IMPORTANT REALLY GOOD AND WE SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. THE IMPACT OF THIS BILL. IT IS UNPRECEDENTED. FOR HOSPITALS THAT WOULD RESULT IN A KIND OF EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. SIXTY PERCENT OF HOSPITALS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WOULD BE OPERATING IN THE RED AT A LOSS. THAT IS DOUBLE THE NUMBER TODAY. AND AS A RESULT HOSPITALS WILL CLOSE. AND I WOULD LIKE TO SAY SINCERELY I'VE SPENT THIRTY YEARS IN THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION. AREA OF WORK. I HAVE NEVER. THREATEN HOSPITAL CLOSURES I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THIS ORDER OF MAGNITUDE WOULD RESULT IN HOSPITAL CLOSURES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN ADDITION AND MORE IMPORTANT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND JOBS LOST. THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT TO HAPPEN WHY IS THAT. ON WE DID BRING A CHART TO HELP EXPLAIN. IT IS BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE IN THAT CHART MEDICARE TODAY PROVIDING CARE FOR PEOPLE OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY FIVE. PAYS LESS THAN THE COST OF CARING FOR A SENIOR. MEDICARE PAYS TWENTY THREE PERCENT LESS THAN THE COST OF CARING FOR A SENIOR IN THE HOSPITAL MEDI CAL PAYS THIRTY TWO PERCENT LESS THAN THE COST. TREATING A MEDI CAL PATIENT IN THE HOSPITAL. AND YES THOSE COSTS PURPOSELY SHIFTED BY GOVERNMENT UNDER FUNDING ON TO PRIVATELY INSURED INDIVIDUALS. MEANING THE PRICES THE PRIVATELY INSURED INDIVIDUALS PAY ARE HIGHER WHAT WOULD THIS BILL DO. IT DOES NOT FILL THE EMPTY BUCKET OF MEDICARE IT DOES NOT FILL THE EMPTY BUCKET OF MEDICAID ALL IT DOES IS TAKE THAT PRIVATE INSURED AMOUNT AND BRING IT DOWN. YES WHAT THIS RED LINE SHOWS YOU IS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF RATES WERE SET AT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF MEDICARE. IT COULD BE MORE IT COULD BE LESS IT IS SIMPLY UNCLEAR IN THE BILL WE USED A FIGURE THAT WAS BEING DISCUSSED AS THE BILL WAS INTRODUCED AT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF MEDICARE. THAT IS A RECIPE FOR DISASTER. IT'S IS ALSO A PROBLEM BECAUSE HOSPITALS STILL HAVE TO PAY THE EXPLODING COSTS OF CARE LABOR. DRUGS SURGICAL SUPPLIES EMERALD EYES OTHER IMAGING EQUIPMENT I. T. SYSTEMS AND THE ENORMOUS COST OF BEING SEISMICALLY PREPARED HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THIS STATE. THAT DOESN'T GO AWAY IF WE SIMPLY PAY LOWER PRICES HOSPITALS HAD TWO CHOICES SHORT CHANGE PATIENT CARE. THAT IS. THERE LARGEST CHANGEABLE COST IS NEXT. AND THAT MEANS LAYING OFF WORKERS. OUR WORKERS COMPRISE MORE THAN SIXTY PERCENT OF A TYPICAL HOSPITAL'S COST IT IS THE ONLY CHOICE THAT THIS PRICE CAPPING BILL ALLOWS. AND UNDER THIS BILL PATIENTS WILL STILL BE STRAPPED WITH OUT OF POCKET DRUG COSTS AND OTHER COMMON OUT OF POCKET MEDICAL EXPENSES. NO MANY SAY THERE IS WIDESPREAD AGREEMENT. THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF THE AFFORDABILITY OF HEALTH CARE IT'S GOT TO BE ADDRESSED AND THE SOLUTIONS WE SHOULD LOOK TO SHOULD NOT COMPROMISE EITHER THE QUALITY OR AVAILABILITY. OF CARE IN CALIFORNIA. AB THIRTY EIGHTY SEVEN IS A FLAWED APPROACH FOR TRYING TO DEAL WITH THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. I WILL SAY THAT THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION STANDS READY. PLAY A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT MAKING CARE MORE AFFORDABLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND HELPING US ALL TO SCRUTINIZE WHAT IS A VERY COMPLEX PROBLEM. IDENTIFY SOLUTIONS AND MOVE WITH ALACRITY IN THAT DIRECTION WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE CARE FOR MILLIONS. WITH THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN WE URGE A NO VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I CAN GO VERY SHORT AND SAY WHAT SHE SAID. FOR PHYSICIANS. I'M DOCTOR TED MAYES OF THE CURRENT PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. I'M A FULL TIME EAR NOSE AND THROAT HEAD AND NECK SURGEON IN SAN DIEGO IN SOLO PRIVATE PRACTICE IT'S NOT DEAD YET. MY PRACTICE INCLUDES MEDICARE MANAGED CARE. MEDICARE DUAL ELIGIBLES PP OWES H. M. O.'S AND UNINSURED INDIVIDUALS. I PRACTICE CLINICAL MEDICINE. BUT I'M ALSO AN EMPLOYER. THE BUSINESS ADMINISTRATOR. PRIOR AUTHORIZATION APPEALS EXPERT UNWILLINGLY. AND MORE AND MORE A DATA ENTRY SPECIALIST COMPLYING WITH MYRIAD COSTLY RULES AND REGULATIONS AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OFTEN DUE TO LEGISLATION. JUST TO GET REIMBURSED FOR MY CLINICAL SERVICES. I'M HERE TODAY TO VOICE CMA'S CONCERNS WITH A. B. THIRTY EIGHTY SEVEN. AND THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS IT WILL HAVE ON OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. WE HAVE SERIOUS FEARS ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANT UNINTENDED QUANT CONSEQUENCES SHOULD THIS BILL BECOME LAW. IT WOULD MAKE CALIFORNIA THE ONLY STATE IN THE NATION. A FIXED POSITION PAYMENTS AND COMMERCIAL MARKETS. ANY PROPOSED SOLUTION TO OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT FAILS TO ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S UNREASONABLY LOW MEDICARE RATES. IS NO SOLUTION TO HEALTHCARE CRISIS AND ALL. MEDI CAL THE COUNTRY'S LARGEST MEDICAID PROGRAM PROVIDES HEALTHCARE TO ALMOST FOURTEEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS ONE THIRD OF THE STATE'S POPULATION. WELL RECENT COVERAGE GAINES SHOULD BE CELEBRATED. CALIFORNIA PERSISTS IN BEING AMONGST THE WORST STATES WHEN WHEN IT COMES TO MEDI CAL PROVIDER RATES. PAYING RATES WELL BELOW THE COST OF PROVIDING SERVICES AND PHYSICIANS OFFICE AS WELL CONSUMING DISPROPORTIONATELY MORE ADMINISTRATIVE TIME THAN MOST OTHER PAYERS. THIS RESULTS IN MANY PHYSICIANS CHOOSING NOT TO SEE MANY. OR IN FACT ANY MEDI CAL PATIENTS. AND THE STATE SHIFTING COSTS FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ON TO THE PURCHASERS OF COMMERCIAL INSURANCE PRODUCTS. AB THIRTY EIGHTY SEVEN WILL EXACERBATE ACCESS PROBLEMS THAT DOES NOTHING TO CORRECT THE UNFAIR LOW FEE SCHEDULE FOR MEDI CAL SERVICES. WHICH REMAINS NEARLY UNCHANGED IN THE THIRTY YEARS I'VE PRACTICED. BY RATE SETTING ONLY COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS AB THIRTY EIGHTY SEVEN WILL MAKE IT EVEN HARDER FOR THOSE STILL WANTING TO SEE MEDI CAL PATIENTS. TO KEEP THEIR PRACTICES VIABLE. NOTHING IN THIS BILL MEANING FULLY ADDRESSES THE PROBLEMS OF MEDI CAL RATHER. IGNORING THE MEDI CAL ISSUES WHILE IMPOSING COMMERCIAL RATE CUTS BASED ON MEDICARE WILL MAKE ALREADY POOR ACCESS TO SPECIALTY AND EVEN PRIMARY CARE FOR MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES. EVEN WORSE. IT IS OUR STRONG BELIEF THAT PASSAGE OF AB THIRTY EIGHTY SEVEN WILL LEAD TO REDUCED WORKFORCE OF PHYSICIANS. CALIFORNIA HAS MUCH TO OFFER IN TERMS OF CLIMATE AND ACTIVITIES. BUT NOT AT THE COST OF BEING UNABLE TO PAY BACK LOANS PURCHASE NEEDED EQUIPMENT. AND REMAIN FINANCIALLY VIABLE IN PRACTICE. THIS WILL IMPACT POSITIONS IN ALL SIZES A PRACTICE. PROPONENTS SAY THAT U. S. POSITIONS GET PAID MORE THAN THEIR EUROPEAN COUNTERPARTS. BUT THEY FAILED TO POINT OUT THE PUBLIC POLICY REGION REASONS FOR THAT BEING SELF. CALIFORNIA EXPECTS POSITIONS TO SELF FINANCE THEIR COLLEGE IN MEDICAL EDUCATION. LEAVING MEDICAL SCHOOL GRADUATES TO GRADUATE WITH HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF PERSONAL DEBT. PHYSICIANS UNLIKE IN THE EUROPEAN NO FAULT SYSTEM MUST SELF FINANCE THEIR LIABILITY COSTS WITH PREMIUMS IN THIS STATE TOPPING FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY. ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ARE NEARLY DOUBLE THAT OF EUROPEAN SYSTEMS. AND PHYSICIANS NOW SPENT TWENTY FIVE TO FIFTY PERCENT OF THEIR TIME DOING UNREIMBURSED ADMINISTRATIVE TASKS. CALIFORNIA IN FACT HAS THE HIGHEST COST TO PRACTICE MEDICINE IN THE ENTIRE NATION. AB THIRTY EIGHTY SEVEN DOES NOTHING TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS INFECTED FAILS TO EVEN ADDRESS THE ACTUAL RISING COST TO POSITIONS IN ORDER TO DELIVER CARE. AND SIMPLY LIMITS PAYMENTS. CALIFORNIA POSITIONS ARE ALREADY LEAN AND EFFICIENT. OVER THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS THE GROWTH FOR PER CAPITA SPENDING A POSITION SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA. HAS RISEN ONLY THREE POINT FIVE PERCENT PER YEAR THE LOWEST IN THE ENTIRE NATION. IT IS NOT HYPERBOLE TO SAY THAT MANY PHYSICIANS WOULD POTENTIALLY LEAVE THE STATE. OR RETIRE EARLY. AND WE WOULD CLEARLY STRUGGLE TO RECRUIT THE NEXT GENERATION OF POSSESSIONS TO COMMON PRACTICE HERE. FINALLY WE DO NOT HAVE FAITH THAT ELEVEN POLITICAL APPOINTEES WILL BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY DETERMINE THE RATES OF OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND POSITIONS. IN A WAY THAT WOULD ENSURE OUR PRACTICES WOULD REMAIN VIABLE. POTENTIAL FOR DISASTER HERE IS IMMENSE. THERE ARE MANY MORE CONCERNS AND I'D BE HAPPY TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH ANY ONE OF YOU AND GOING TO GREATER DETAIL. SHOULD THIS POORLY CONCEIVED PRICE FIXING PROPOSAL UNFORTUNATELY MOVE FORWARD AFTER TODAY'S HEARING. THIS BODY RECENTLY COMMISSION THE UCSF REPORT THROUGH THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON HEALTH CARE DELIVERY AND UNIVERSAL ACCESS. WHICH RECOMMENDED TO POLICIES THAT THE LEGISLATURE OUGHT TO BE TACKLING. ONE RAISING MEDI CAL PROVIDER RATES. TO ENSURING THAT THE STATE HAS A SUFFICIENT POSITION WORKFORCE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF A GROWING POPULATION. AB THIRTY EIGHTY SEVEN FLIES IN THE FACE OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS BY GUARANTEEING THAT CALIFORNIA WILL BE ONE OF THE WORST STATES IN WHICH TO PRACTICE MEDICINE. YES THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH AFFORDABLE ACCESS TO CARE. AND WE ARE TRYING TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION FOR UNIVERSAL ACCESS. BUT AB THIRTY EIGHTY SEVEN IS CLEARLY NOT THE ANSWER WE URGE A NO VOTE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON SHARON MCKEE REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THERE'S NO DISAGREEMENT THE HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE RISING AND MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES TO FOR QUALITY ACCESSIBLE CARE. HENCE MY TESTIMONY ON A FEW OTHER BILLS THIS AFTERNOON. THE PROPONENTS OF AB THIRTY EIGHTY SEVEN ARGUED THAT THEIR APPROACH WILL CONTROL HEALTHCARE COSTS BUT IN PRACTICE THE PROPOSAL MAY IN FACT RESULT IN LESS ACCESS TO CARE IN THE SHORT TERM. AND ACCELERATE COST INCREASES IN THE LONG TERM. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE BILL WILL INTERFERE WITH AN EMPLOYER'S ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE FOR BENEFIT DESIGNS AND COSTS FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES. AB THIRTY EIGHTY SEVEN EMPOWERS THE COMMISSION IN ADDITION TO SETTING RATES TO PROVIDERS AND INSURERS TO DECIDE THE LEVEL OF CO PAYS DEDUCTIBLES COINSURANCE AND ANY OTHER SHARE OF COSTS FOR SERVICES. EMPLOYERS LIKE COVER CALIFORNIA ARE ACTIVE PURCHASERS ACTIVE PURCHASERS NEGOTIATE WITH HEALTH PLANS ON PRICES NETWORKS AND QUALITY MEASURES. THE ULTIMATE PRICE PLAYS A KEY ROLE AND OTHER FACETS OF HEALTH OF A HEALTH PLAN SUCH AS THE NUMBER OF DOCTORS OFFERED TO PATIENTS OR COST SHARING. THE BILL WOULD ALSO REDUCE ACCESS TO CARE MANY ECONOMISTS BELIEVE PRICE CONTROLS KEEP PRICES ARTIFICIALLY LOW AND SUPPLY DOES NOT KEEP UP WITH DEMAND. IN THE CASE OF HEALTH CARE THE LACK OF SUPPLY WOULD MEAN FEWER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. WITHOUT AN ADEQUATE SIX SUPPLY OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS CONSUMERS MAY PAY LESS BUT THEY MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE CARE THEY NEED. SO EMPLOYEES MAY BE INSURED BUT THEY MAY NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO SEE THEIR PROVIDER. AB THIRTY EIGHTY SEVEN FAILED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE MAJOR CAUSES OF WRITING MEDICAL CARE COSTS. SIMPLY CAPPING RATES WILL NOT MAKE COSTS IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM DISAPPEAR. IT WILL LIMIT CHOICES NEGATIVELY IMPACT ACCESS AND IN THE LONG TERM INCREASED COSTS FOR EMPLOYERS AND THEIR EMPLOYEES FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL.

HOW MUCH? WE HAVE FIVE MINUTES. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SURE. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS SARAH FLOCKS IN THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATIONS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. THE OPPOSITION IS DEFENDING A SYSTEM THAT WE KNOW IS BROKEN. IT IS BROKEN FOR WORKERS FOR EMPLOYERS FOR GOVERNMENT AND FOR PATIENTS IN CALIFORNIA. MOST OF ALL IT'S BROKEN FOR COMMUNITIES THAT ALREADY HAVE A SHORTAGE OF PROVIDERS WHO HAVE A LACK OF ACCESS FOR RURAL AREAS. AND IT IS BROKEN FOR MEDI CAL PATIENTS AND MEDI CAL PROVIDERS. THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT PUNISHING PROVIDERS AT ITS CORE IT IS ABOUT ACCESS AND IT'S ABOUT ADDRESSING THE INEQUITIES IN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM THAT LEAD TO A LACK OF ACCESS. THAT'S WHY THE NAME OF THE COMMISSION IS THAT COMMISSION ON HEALTH CARE COST QUALITY IN EQUITY YOU CANNOT SEPARATE THEM. I WANT TO START OFF BY ADDRESSING THE. CHART THE MATH DOESN'T ADD UP. WHICH TIES INTO THE ISSUE OF MEDI CAL REIMBURSEMENT AND ACCESS. A SUBSTANTIAL BODY OF EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT PROVIDERS THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY SERVE LOW INCOME AND ELDERLY POPULATIONS THE MEDI CAL AND MEDICARE POPULATIONS. CHARGE LOWER PRICES TO PRIVATE PAYERS IN FACT A TWENTY SIXTEEN STUDY THAT FOUND THAT FOR EVERY PERCENT INCREASE. IN THE MEDICAID POPULATION SO THE MEDI CAL POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA THE AVERAGE HOSPITAL CHARGE TO PRIVATE PAYERS DECREASED BY ONE POINT TWO PERCENT WHICH IS A DROP OF ELEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS. NOT INCREASE DECREASE. AND WHY. BECAUSE PROVIDERS WITH HIGH MEDI CAL AND MEDICARE POPULATIONS ARE MORE EFFICIENT AND COST EFFECTIVE. IN OTHER WORDS THEY DO MORE WITH LESS COSTS ARE NOT IMMUTABLE. IN FACT MED PAC WHICH IS THE MEDICARE PAYMENT ADVISORY COMMISSION WHICH ADVISES CONGRESS ON MEDICARE. SAYS THAT IN A QUOTE WHEN A HOSPITAL RECEIVES HIGHER PAYMENTS FROM COMMERCIAL PAYERS THE FINANCIAL PRESSURE ON THE HOSPITAL'S LOWER. IT THEREFORE HAS LESS INCENTIVE KEEP ITS COSTS LOW. ON THE FLIPSIDE MED PAC HAS ALSO SHOWN THE PROVIDERS UNDER FINANCIAL PRESSURE WHO RESEARCH RECEIVE LOWER COMMERCIAL RE EMBRACE REIMBURSEMENTS ARE ABLE TO RESTRAIN THEIR COSTS. HI COMMERCIAL PRICES. ARE NOT CORRELATED WITH SERVING LARGE POPULATIONS OF MEDI CAL ARE MEDICARE THEY ARE CORRELATED WITH HAVING MONOPOLY POWER. IF YOU ARE IN IN AN AREA WHERE YOU CAN COMMAND HIGHER PRICES THEN YOU WILL. YOU WILL HAVE HIGHER COMMERCIAL PRICES REGARDLESS OF YOU SERVE A SINGLE MEDI CAL IN RELIEF OR NOT. AND WHY. BECAUSE WE LET THEM BECAUSE THE COMMERCIAL MARKET IS FRAGMENTED OPAQUE AND DRIVEN BY PROFIT. AB THIRTY EIGHTY SEVEN SIX TO REMEDY THE INEQUITIES THAT WE HAVE IN OUR EXISTING BROKEN SYSTEM BY TAKING IN ACCOUNT PROVIDERS THAT SERVE MEDI CAL POPULATIONS THAT ARE IN RURAL AREAS THAT ARE IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. WHERE THERE ARE IT IS A LACK OF ACCESS WHEN THEY SAT BASE RATES? THAT WILL CREATE A LINK A REASONABLE LINK BETWEEN MEDI CAL AND COMMERCIAL RATES THIS IS A LINK THAT DOES NOT EXIST RIGHT NOW. THIS BILL WILL BRING TRANSPARENCY AND FAIRNESS TO ARE CURTAINS CURRENT SYSTEM OUR CURRENT SYSTEM THAT REWARDS MONOPOLIES AND DEVALUES THE PROVIDERS THAT MAKE UP OUR SAFETY NET AND PROVIDE CARE. TO THE IN THE IN THE ARE MOST RURAL AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. CHAIR AND MEMBERS MITCHELL HAVE DATA WITH SEIU CALIFORNIA WE ARE ONE OF THE CO SPONSORS OF THIS BILL. I'M I WANT TO SPEAK TO A FEW OF THE POINTS AND PARTICULARLY THE POINT SPACEY HA THAT THIS BILL WOULD LEAD TO BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN CUTS AND A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND JOBS LOST IN. HOSPITAL SECTORS WE REPRESENT HOSPITAL WORKERS WE SEE THIS AS A THINLY VEILED THREAT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THE COMMISSION IS REQUIRED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHEN SETTING. THE BASE RATE A FAIR RETURN ON INVESTMENT REASONABLE LABOR COSTS INCLUDING THE COSTS OF BARGAINING AGREEMENTS CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND CHANGES IN THE DELIVERY OF CARE. THERE ALSO WITH AMENDMENT SEEKING IN THIS COMMITTEE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE AMOUNT OF. MEDI CAL PURPOSE POPULATION SERVED AND SO ALL OF THAT IS BUILT INTO THE BASE RATE WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS MAKING COST SHIFTING. REAL ACTUALLY REWARDING THOSE PROVIDERS THAT ARE DOING MORE IN THE PUBLIC PROGRAMS RATHER THAN LETTING ARBITRARY MARKET FORCES DECIDE THAT. DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SHOULD GET PAID THIRTY FIVE TO SEVENTY PERCENT HIGHER THAN DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS IN LOS ANGELES AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WITH RESPECT TO THE PHYSICIAN POPULATION DOCTORS ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE CONSOLIDATED OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS OR LESS ACTUALLY. WE'VE MOVED TO HALF OF ALL PHYSICIANS IN HOSPITAL OWNED PHYSICIAN GROUPS AND WE PUT AN AMENDMENT IN THAT SAYS NO DOCTORS WITHOUT DATA ABSENT THE DATA THE COMMISSION CANNOT MOVE TO SET RATES FOR HOSPITALS AND DOCTORS. THANK YOU. SO YOU HAD TWO MINUTES LEFT ON ON THE OPPOSITION SO THEY'RE GOING TO GET A CHANCE TO. AND WILL SHARE THIS QUICKLY. WE DO HOPE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO UNPACK FOR YOU THE CONFUSION THAT SEEMS TO EXIST BETWEEN PRICES. COSTS AND DOING STUDIES AND ALL THE REST TO COUPLE POINTS PLEASE DID YOU KNOW. THAT IN CALIFORNIA. HOSPITAL COSTS ARE SIX AND A HALF PERCENT BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE DID YOU KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA'S HOSPITAL COSTS ARE IN THE BOTTOM QUARTILE THE BOTTOM TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. OF COSTS NATIONALLY WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT VARIATION DID YOU KNOW THAT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA HAS THE TOP TWELVE CITIES IN TERMS OF WAGES IN THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES. WE WELCOME CONVERSATION TO TALK MORE ABOUT THE UNDERLYING DRIVERS BUT PLEASE DO NOT BE FOOLED BY NUMBERS AND DATA THAT ARE BEING THROWN AT YOU THERE ARE REAL REASONS AN IMPORTANT REASONS FOR VARIATIONS IN COST. AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COSTS AND PRICES. THANK YOU I'LL TRY TO DO THIS QUICKLY. IT IS A BROKEN SYSTEM FOR PROVIDERS AS WELL WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE WANT TO SEE IT FIXED BUT WE WANT TO SEE A FIX RESPONSIBLY. WE ARE FOR TRANSPARENCY BUT WE ARE NOT FOR PRICE FIXING THAT DOESN'T DEAL WITH ACTUAL COSTS. THE FACT THAT THIS BILL CONTAINS GLOBAL CAPS BELIES ANY ARGUMENT THAT IT WOULD KEEP UP WITH THE ACTUAL COST OF CARE. IF CAPS HAVE TO BE REDUCED BECAUSE WE OVER EXPENDED. ON NEEDED MEDICAL SERVICES WHY PUNISH THE PROVIDERS ON THE BACK AND. AND MAY I REMIND THE LEGISLATURE THAT THIS LEGISLATURE HAS HAD SIMILAR LANGUAGE ABOUT PERCENTAGE OF MEDICARE IN THE PAST. THIS BILL DOES NOT DEFINE WHAT THAT PERCENT YES BUT THIS LEGISLATURE HAS PLAYED WITH A HUNDRED PERCENT IN S. B. FIVE IN AB FIVE THIRTY THREE. AND A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE PERCENT IN AB SEVENTY TWO FOR NON CONTRACT PROVIDERS GIVING THE BULK OF CARE IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM WHEN THERE ARE NO CONTRACTED PROVIDERS AVAILABLE. WHY DO WE BELIEVE THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD NOT LOOK AT A HUNDRED TO A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE PERCENT WHICH IS WELL BELOW THE COST OF CARE? ONE LAST COMMENT MEDICARE IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS HAS FALLEN WAY BELOW THE ACTUAL INFLATION RATE. IN WHAT IT PAYS POSITIONS IN THIS STATE AND NATION WIDE IT IS NOT A GOOD. MARKER. OKAY. NOW QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SO STERN BANKS I THINK AS CHAIR. I WAS KALRA WHAT BOB AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE EFFORT IN TEND TO THIS BILL. TO ADDRESS. ON AFFORDABILITY IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND HOWEVER SICK COME AS NO SURPRISE THAT I'M I DON'T SUPPORT THIS PARTICULAR APPROACH IS TO COST CONTAINMENT. I DON'T THINK THAT GOVERNMENT PRICE SETTING IS THE BEST THE BEST APPROACH AND WE'VE HEARD SOME OF THAT IN. AMONGST THE WITNESSES TODAY DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. A FOR YOU IF THAT'S OKAY. BUT IT IS WELL KNOWN AS A SOME THE WITNESSES TALKED ABOUT ABOUT COST SHIFTING IN HEALTH CARE AS A RESULT OF LOW REIMBURSEMENT RATES IN IN MEDI CAL. A FOR HOSPITALS THAT HAVE A LARGE SHARE OF MEDI CAL PATIENTS AND I CAN THINK OF A HANDFUL OF THEM BOUT WITH IN THE INLAND EMPIRE WHERE I REPRESENT. I'M HOW WOULD THEY MAKE ENDS MEET IF THEY FURTHER SQUEEZE PAYMENTS FROM PRIVATE PAY PATIENTS. IT SEEMS TO BE UNWORKABLE. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND THE REALITY IS FIRST OF ALL THERE'S A. A FALSE PRESUMPTION THAT'S BEEN PUT FORTH THAT THOSE THAT ARE TAKING ON MORE MEDI CAL AND MEDICARE PATIENTS ARE BARB DOING IT SIMPLY BY. INCREASING COMMERCIAL RATES THE REALITY IS THAT THE FACTS DON'T DICTATE THAT THE FACTS ACCEDED TO THAT THOSE THAT TAKE MORE MEDI CAL. AND MEDICARE PATIENTS ACTUALLY GET A LOWER COMMERCIAL RATE WHAT IS DRIVING THE COMMERCIAL RATES IS NOT THAT THEY'RE ALL TAKING CARE. OF THOSE THAT ARE ON MEDI CAL BUT I WILL TELL YOU THIS THAT IN THIS BILL WE DO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. AND IT'S INCLUDED NOT ONLY. IN THE ORIGINAL. BUT DROPPED IN THE AMENDED DRAFT BUT ALSO IN. IN MY ACCEPTING THE POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE CHAIR AND THE STAFF AND THE STAFF. TO ACTUALLY FIND WAYS TO MAKE UP FOR THOSE CLINICS HOSPITALS DOCTORS THAT TAKE. MORE MEDI CAL PATIENTS AND WE DO THAT BY JUST IN THE COMMERCIAL RATE IN A WAY THAT REWARDS THEM. REWARDS THEM FOR TAKING CARE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR STATE AND REWARDS THEM. FOR ACTUALLY DOING A PUBLIC SERVICE THE REALITY IS IF IT WERE TRUE IF IT WERE TRUE THAT THOSE THAT TOOK ON MORE MEDI CAL PATIENTS WERE BEING COMPENSATED APPROPRIATELY BY COMMERCIAL RATES AND WE DON'T WANT TO MESS WITH THE COMMERCIALLY BECAUSE OF IT. THEN IN SO MANY RULE COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY HAVE AN EXCESS OF MEDICAL RATES THEN THEY WOULDN'T HAVE DOCTORS BEING PAID LESS THAN DOCTORS AND OTHER COMMUNITIES ON THE COMMERCIAL RATES AND IN FACT. IN MANY RURAL COMMUNITIES DOCTORS OF GETTING COMMERCIAL RATES EVEN BELOW MEDICARE RIGHT NOW AND WHY IS THAT. THE DOCTORS HAVE NO LEVERAGE THEY HAVE NO BARGAINING POWER WITH THESE CONSOLIDATED SYSTEMS WITH THESE MONOPOLISTIC MONOPOLISTIC HOSPITALS AND AND. THE DEAD TAPES SUGGEST THAT THEY DO IS JUST NOT TRUE. AND SO MY AND MY MY ANSWER TO YOU THE SHORT ANSWER IS MEDI CAL. IT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT ONLY INCLUDED IN THIS IS GONNA BE A MAJOR PART OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON IN THE WEEKS AHEAD HOW DO WE ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT. WE HAVE SO MANY MEDI CAL. PATIENTS IN OUR STATE AND HOW THE WE INCENTIVIZE DOCTORS TO NOT ONLY TAKE MEDI CAL PATIENTS AND MEDICARE PATIENTS BUT FOR DOCTORS TO GOING TO RURAL COMMUNITIES UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY DON'T GO RIGHT NOW. AND THEY DON'T GO THERE BECAUSE THE COMMERCIAL RATES DON'T INCENTIVIZE AND. THING I REPRESENT A RURAL AREA AND. LIKE I GET SOME SOME CONTRADICTORY NAM. ARGUMENTS FROM I'M SO MY LOCAL UP LOCAL DOCKS IN HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. THAT I'M HAPPY TO TALK TO THEM IT IT I GOT A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS A COUPLE MORE IF. IF THIS BILL SUPPOSED TO REIN IN COSTS A WHITE AS A SOLELY FOCUS ON GOVERNMENT PRICE FIXING HAS THIS. WHAT ABOUT UTILIZATION IN THE COST OF LABOR FOR EXAMPLE WHICH ARE ALSO MAJOR COST DRIVERS? WELL THAT'S PART OF THE REASON THE AND I'M GLAD YOU MENTIONED UTILIZATION BECAUSE THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. UP WITH WITH THE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WE HAVE SEEN INCREASED ACCESS TO PEOPLE HAVE UPPER HEALTH INSURANCE CARD YOU SEE HEALTHCARE COSTS GO UP BUT UTILIZATION HAS GONE DOWN. SO THAT TELLS US THAT PEOPLE ARE ARE ARE RATIONING THEIR HEALTHCARE BECAUSE COSTS ARE GOING UP AND SO THAT IT'S. THE THE. EUROPEAN QUESTIONING AND. THAT POINT ENTITIES RELIGIOUSLY UTILIZATION IN THE COST OF LABOR WHY ARE WE LOOKING AT ALL THOSE COSTS ARE ALL THOSE COSTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR. AND THE README AND ONE OF THE THE COMMENTS MADE BY OPPOSITION WHICH ACTUALLY IS AS IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF. I COUNTING FOR ALL THOSE INCREASED COSTS AND IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT CAN BE ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE BASED AT BASE COSTS AND ADJUSTMENTS IT IS INCREASED LABOR COSTS. IT IS. THE. ENOUGH YOU HAVE MAINTENANCE OR IF YOU HAVE NEW FACILITIES ARE BUILDING. AND SO THE IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE GLOBAL CAP WHICH WAS REFERRED TO IS TO ENSURE YES IF WE DO SET RATES FOR BUT SERVICES WE DON'T WANT TO SEE HAPPEN IS WHAT WE SAW HAPPEN IN MARYLAND IS THAT PEOPLE JUST STARTED. INCREASING NUMBER THE SERVICES THEY DID TO MAKE MORE MONEY AND IT WAS NASA CONNECTED TO CARE. AND AND WHAT WAS NEEDED SO THAT MARYLAND A FEW YEARS AGO RECOGNIZING THAT SORT OF PUTTING GLOBAL CAPSULAR DEFERRED OR A S. YEAH YOU REPRESENTATIVE IN TERMS OF LABOR COSTS. BUT I MENTION THE GLOBAL CLOCK CAP BECAUSE THAT IS A WAY TO ENSURE THAT COST ON TO SPIRAL OUT OF CONTROL. ON LABOR SIDE WHAT HAVE YOU AND THEN THE HOSPITAL OR THE DOCTOR'S AT THE DEAL WITH THAT BECAUSE THEY ARE GETTING LESS ON THE POLL ON THE. RIGHT SIDE. THANK YOU OF VICE CHAIR MAYES. IN OUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS WITH HOSPITALS LABOR COST INCREASES HAVE BEEN STEADY AT AROUND TWO PERCENT WE ACCOUNT FOR MAYBE ONE TO TWO PERCENT OF OVERALL COST INCREASES IN THE HOSPITAL SECTOR. WHICH. HAS BEEN OUT PIECING PRESCRIPTION DRUG CROSS COSTS AS THE NUMBER ONE FASTEST GROWING. PRICE INCREASE IN HEALTH CARE SO. LET ME REPHRASE THAT HOSPITAL COSTS HAVE BEEN GOING UP FASTER THAN PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS AND. WE CAN PROVIDE A CITATION ON THAT BUT CLEARLY IF WERE ONE PERCENT TWO PERCENT OF THE OVERALL PRICE INCREASES OVER TIME AND HOLDING STEADY. WE'RE NOT REALLY THE DRIVER OF THAT HIGH. PRICE. WELL IT AND IT JUST ONE MORE QUESTION BECAUSE IT ACTION WHAT'S GOING TO GET TO THAT TO THAT POINT I MEAN IN READING THIS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS IT SEEMED LIKE THE ECONOMICS IN THE POLITICS OF THIS. A SEEM LITTLE OFF A BECAUSE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT. YEAH I DON'T I GUESS I'M I'M. THE QUESTION I HAVE IS HOW WILL. HELP ME UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN HAVE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IN UNREGULATED PAY RAISES AND BENEFIT INCREASES FOR CERTAIN GROUPS OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS LIKE NURSES AND. I AM ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHAT THE SAME TIME COMPLETELY CONSTRAINING THE RATES AND CHARGES OF THE PEOPLE THE HOSPITAL'S OPPOSITION GROUPS. WHO HAVE TO PAY THOSE WORKERS IT IN ECONOMIC SENSE IN IT AND FROM AN ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVE IT JUST DOESN'T DOESN'T MAKE SENSE HOW DO WE? HOW DO WE? JUSTIFY THOSE TO. THOSE PAY RATE INCREASES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AND HOW THE RATES ARE JUST. SO IF THERE IS OF A BARGAINING UNIT HOSPITAL AND THEY AGREED TO GIVE THE NURSES A TWO PERCENT PAY RAISE WELL IN THE AND NUMBER THERE'S AN ANNUAL. REVIEW SO THAT OTHER. AS THAT OCCURS RATES CAN BE ADJUSTED BY THAT SAME PERCENTAGE ACCOUNT FOR THAT. IN FACT THE COMMISSION IS REQUIRED TO FACTOR LABOR COSTS INTO THE BASE RATE SO NOT. NOT THE YOU KNOW YOU CAN COME BACK HIM GONNA APPEAL IT THE BASE RATE NEEDS TO FACTOR IN YOUR THE COST OF LABOR THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS. PLUS A REASONABLE RATE OF RETURN. AND IN ADDITION ON TOP OF THAT ACT AREAS WHERE THERE ACCESS PROBLEMS ALL OF THAT IS IN THE BASE ANYTHING ABOVE THAT YOU CAN APPEAL FOR BUT ALL OF THAT SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE BAIT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A SORT OF ONE. A HOMOGENEOUS ACROSS THE BOARD RATE IT'S ACTUALLY BASED ON MEDICARE WHICH DOES HAVE VARIATION WITHIN IT BY REGION AND BY. PROVIDERS SERVICE. OKAY KIND OF THE OPPOSITION THAT. MISTER CHAIRMAN RESTORE TALK ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION I JUST BRIEFLY WANT RESPOND TO SOME OF THOSE COMMENTS I THINK THE FIRST ONE WOULD BE. THAT WE HAVE GREAT CONCERN THAT AN ELEVEN MEMBER COMMISSION IS GOING TO ACCURATELY SEPARATES FOR BEFORE UNDER HOSPITALS OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND PHYSICIANS. IN A MANNER THAT ECONOMICALLY VIABLE I KNOW THAT THE LANGUAGE THAT THE PEOPLE TAKE THESE FACTORS INTO ACCOUNT. BUT IF THEY GET IT WRONG. THE RAT THE RAMIFICATIONS FOR THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY IS. QUITE SEVERE AND SECONDLY THE STATISTICS THAT ARE CITED BOTH IN THE ATTACK LANGUAGE AND THAT THE PROPONENTS CONTINUE SITE ARE BASED ON NATIONAL A STATISTICS AND SO I THINK WE WANT TO POINT OUT IN CALIFORNIA. AGAIN THE POSITION GROWTH WITH OVER THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS IS BASED ON MEDICARE DATA ACROSS ALL PAYERS IS THREE POINT SIX PERCENT THE NATIONAL AVERAGE IS FOUR POINT FIVE AT WE ARE THE LOWEST AS FAR AS WAS USED IN SERVICE AS HAS BEEN THE LOWEST GROWTH. OF ANY STATE I'M SO THE FACT THAT NOW AS A RESULT OF THAT WE HAVE TO PUT FAITH IN ELEVEN MEMBER COMMISSION THAT'S SUPPOSED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL THESE FACTORS. QUICKLY IS REALLY UNREALISTIC AND AS FAR AS THE WORLD ACCESS. MOST OF YOUR RURAL MEMBERS TO RURAL HOSPITALS ARE SEEN PATIENTS ON MEDI CAL AND MEDICARE. THIS BILL ALTHOUGH IT SPEAKS TO MEDI CAL MEDICARE DOES NOTHING IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY. TO RAISE THOSE RATES WERE INCREASED ACCESS IF IF THEY WANT TO PUT IN AN INCREASE IN MEDICAL RATES UP TO MEDICARE I THINK THAT'S A CONVERSATION WE COULD HAVE. BREWING TALK ABOUT THIRD OF THE MARKET AND AGAIN MEDI CAL ON POSITION SERVICES BATES ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT. OF OF MEDICARE AND IT'S OFTEN BELOW COST. IF I MAY I'D LIKE TO UNDERSCORE. HONESTLY ON WORKABILITY OF APPEALS SYSTEM. HAVING SPENT MANY YEARS IN MARILYN THIS IS NOT AT ALL HOW THE SYSTEM IN MARYLAND WORKS IT WAS A SYSTEM THAT WORKED SUCCESSFULLY FOR FORTY YEARS AND THEN. THE STATE. TOOK A WHOLE NEW APPROACH. BUT THERE THE RATES ARE SET BASED ON THE UNDERLYING COSTS EXPERIENCED BY A HOSPITAL. HAS A VERY OFTEN HIGHER IN AN URBAN AREA AND THEY ARE IN A RURAL AREA. THEIR HIGHER FOR A TEACHING HOSPITAL THAN A NON TEACHING HOSPITAL THEY HAVE TO REFLECT THE CHALLENGE ENVIRONMENT THAT HOSPITALS TREATING LARGE NUMBERS OF MEDICARE AND MEDICAID WITH SIGNIFICANT. UNDER FUNDING NEED TO STAY AFLOAT IT IS NOT AN APPEALS PROCESS IS A VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE GROUP OF PEOPLE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE HOSPITAL'S CIRCUMSTANCE SETTING DIFFERENTIAL RATES THERE IS NO TIME. TO MEDICARE. AND BY THE WAY. FOR A COUNTRY THAT IS JUST INCREASED OUR FEDERAL DEFICIT BY ONE AND A HALF TRILLION DOLLARS. WHAT HAPPENS TO FEDERAL MEDICARE PAYMENTS HAS MORE TO DO WITH WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE FEDERAL DEFICIT AND DEBT THAN IT DOES WITH ANY HEALTHCARE POLICY? WHY WOULD WE IN CALIFORNIA ONE A TETHER OURSELVES TO A RATE THAT'S BEING DRIVEN? BY DEFICITS AND DEBT. MISS MISTER CHAIR BY GOOD REVIEW IF I COULD RESPOND TO THAT YOU KNOW ALL ALL. ALL OF THOSE FACTORS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN THIS BILL IN THE BASE ADJUSTMENTS AND WOULDN'T EVEN REQUIRED APPEAL OF COURSE THE APPEAL PROCESS AND STILL AVAILABLE. SO WHETHER IT'S A TEACHING HOSPITAL A RESEARCH FACILITY IN A RULE COMMUNITY IN URBAN COMMUNITY HIGHER COST LIVING LOWER COST LIVING THAT'S ALL CAUGHT ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE ADJUSTED BASE RATE. AND WILL BE ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE FACT THAT. THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT AND RURAL COMMUNITIES THEY ONLY TAKE MEDI CAL ON MEDICARE PATIENTS IS A PROBLEM. THE FACT THEY DON'T HAVE SPECIALIST THOSE COMMUNITIES AS A PROBLEM. AND I THINK THAT A WE ACTUALLY HAVE ACCOUNT FOR THOSE COMMERCIAL RATES AND GIVE CREDIT. TO THOSE DOCTORS IN THOSE PROVIDERS THAT ARE. SOLELY TAKING CARE OF LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS THE WE CANNOT YOU JUST COMMERCIAL RATES ACCORDINGLY BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THEY DON'T HAVE THE LEVERAGE TO DO THAT. IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT. JERRY JUST FIVE IF I CAN CLOSE BY JUST SAYING. AGAIN MISTER KALRA UNDERSTAND OF THE PROBLEM I'M I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ALL NEED TO TO WORK OUT WORK ON. I LOOK FORWARD TO IN THE NEXT. COMING MONTHS WORKING WITH THE CHAIR LAMP OTHER MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE AND STAKEHOLDERS AMONG WORKING SOMETHING WORK BUT I'M WORKING ON SOMETHING THAT WE CAN ALL. THEM THOUGH BUT. WORK ON TOGETHER A TO TRY TO LOWER THE COST IN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM I JUST THINK THIS THE THE WRONG APPROACH THE BODY NOT. IF THERE. THANK YOU SO CHAIR ON THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR IN TO ALL THE PRESENTERS. SIR SOME AMERICANA. I'LL GET YOU ADDRESS OR OR YOU WITNESSES ADDRESS ONE OF THE ASSERTIONS THAT WAS MADE THAT THIS BILL. WOULD LEAD OPPOSITION SECESSION LEAD THE STATE AND ON. BEALL. WELL I I HAD A BUNCH MEETINGS. RECENTLY ON THIS ISSUE AND THAT WAS THE NUMBER ONE CONCERN THAT WAS PRESENTED THAT. POSITIONS WOULD. BASICALLY BE IN A POSITION WHERE THEY COULDN'T. EARN ENOUGH IN THEIR PRACTICE IN TO PAY OFF LOANS AND THAT IT WOULD NOT BE SUCH A TREAT AN ACCESS PROBLEM WHICH YOU KNOW UPS YOU WANT CONTROL COSTS BUT WE DON'T CREATE NEXUS PROBLEM. COULD SPEAK TO THAT PLEASE SURE OF AND UNDER OUR IS ISSUES WITH ACCESS TO POSITIONS IN MANY PARTS OF OUR STATE RIGHT NOW. AND A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE THAT THE DIFFERENTIAL AND HOW THEY'RE COMPENSATED AND THEIR ABILITY. TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A PRACTICE. OR FOR HOSPITALS. THAT THAT CLOSE IN THEIR COMMUNITY HOT BILL TO PROVIDE DOCTORS THAT COMMUNITY AYE AND THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT I MEAN AS INDICATED. IN OUT OF THE. RIGHT NOW WHAT HE IN TERMS JUST TAKING MEDICARE PATIENTS LONGER SENIOR FINE DOCTOR TAKING MORE AND MORE. MEDICARE PATIENTS. AND SO AND AND HAS REFERRED TO. CERTAIN COMMUNITIES WHERE DOCTORS ARE ONLY TAKING MEDICARE AND MEDICAL PATIENTS AND PRESUMABLY THIS WOULD NOT IMPACT THEM BUT THIS WOULD IT WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO IS ACTUALLY. BOOSTTHE PAPER SOME DOCTORS IN COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY'RE NOT GETTING COMPENSATED ENOUGH IT'S NOT A. SALARY OR A PAY CUT. TO THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY. AND. FURTHERMORE IN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT TYPICALLY THE CHAIRS GREAT INTEREST IN AND CONCERN UP WHICH IS WHAT YOU'VE ECHOED RIGHT NOW WITH WITH THE DOCTORS AND HOW DIFFICULT IT IS FOR DOCTORS. COMING OUT OF MEDICAL SCHOOL WITH A LOT OF DEBT. DE. AFFRONT FIRST OF ALL DOCTORS ARE NOT BE INCORPORATING THIS INTO THEIR DATA AND THAT AND THAT WILL BE TAKE AT LEAST THREE YEARS TO GET DATA. OF REAL INFORMATION SECONDLY WE BELIEVE THAT WITH THIS IN PLACE YOU'LL HAVE A SAVINGS AND PUBLIC PLANS. WITH THOSE SAVINGS NOT ONLY TO BE SEEK TO HELP IMPROVE MEDI CAL REIMBURSEMENT RATES BUT WE ALSO WANT TO AB FUND AT A MUCH HIGHER LEVEL PROGRAMS THAT RIGHT NOW. ARE AVAILABLE TO DOCTORS THERE JUST UNDER FUNDED THEY'RE WEIGHTLESS FOR THEM DOCTORS GOING INTO RESIDENTS HE'S PUT UP LONG REPAYMENT PROGRAMS. WE WANNA WORK OF REDUCE LOAN DEBT FRY DOCTORS COMING OUT OF MEDICAL SCHOOL AND WE THINK THAT WE CAN DO THAT WITH COST SAVINGS ON THIS BILL. WITH COSTS AND THE COSTUMES WOULD BE A REDUCTION IN THE EXPECTED RISE IN HEALTHCARE COSTS IN THE DO WHAT ONE OR TWO DECADES AHEAD WITHOUT ALONE WE EXPECT THAT WE CAN HAVE IN PUBLIC PLANS ALONE. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SAVINGS YOU MENTION MEDICARE RATES IS GOING ON A MISSION MEDICARE RESA OUT YOU KNOW A LOT OF US HAVE WORKED ON THIS FOR A LONG TIME CONCERNED ABOUT HOW LOW MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT RATES ARE. UP WOULD SHOOT WHICH YOU STATE WHAT YOU WERE SAYING A MINUTE AGO ABOUT. YOU'RE CREATING MORE OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE AS I UNDERSTAND IT SOME OF THE DOCTORS WHO ACCEPT PRIVATE PAY AND MEDI CAL ESSENTIALLY USE A PRIVATE PAY PATIENTS TO HELP IN A WAY. UP MAKE UP FOR THE FACT THAT THE MEDICARE RATES REALLY LOW AND AND YOU'RE SAYING THAT THERE'S ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY THAT. THAT THOUGHT THANK YOU MET THE I THINK IN A STATEMENT THAT'S THE ARGUMENT THAT SOMETHING REALITY. AND IN FACT. THIS COMMISSION CAN SET THAT AS A REALITY THAT THOSE DOCTORS ARE TAKING MORE MEDI CAL PATIENTS MEDICARE BUT PATIENTS WOULD GET A HIGHER REIMBURSEMENT THE COMMERCIAL RATE. THE REALITY IS THAT'S NOT THE COST DRIVER OF THE COST WEBER IS NOT BECAUSE DOCTORS ARE TAKING MORE MEDI CAL MEDICARE PATIENTS DESPISES IS IT'S SIMPLY NOT TRUE. AND MANY OF THE HOSPITALS OF YOU SEEN DRAMATIC INCREASE IN RATES IS NOT BECAUSE THOSE HOSPITALS HAVE THE DISPROPORTION NUMBER MEDI CAL OR MEDICARE PATIENTS COMPARED TO OTHER HOSPITALS THAT DON'T SEE. THAT KIND OF INCH INCREASING RATES AND SO THIS COMMISSION WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY. I BELIEVE A LEAD TO THAT LEAD TO THE RECOGNITION OF THOSE DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS ARE ACTUALLY TAKING PATIENTS THAT ARE ANNIE TAKING MEDICARE AND TAKING MEDI CAL PATIENTS. AND TO COMPENSATE THEM INCENTIVIZE THEM FOR DOING THAT PARTICULARLY IN RURAL COMMUNITIES. AS INDICATED IF AND RURAL COMMUNITIES OF THEIR SEEM ALSO MEDI CAL MEDICARE PATIENTS AND THERE'S A LOT OF SPECIALISTS AND ANOTHER THAT WILL GO A FAMILY PRACTITIONERS OTHERS ARE GOING TO RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE. HEAVILY UNDERSERVED RIGHT NOW WELL IF THEY'RE ABLE TO GET MORE ON THE COMMERCIAL RATES GUESS WHAT YOU CAN HAVE A GREATER INCENTIVE FOR DOCTORS TO GO INTO THOSE RULE COMMUNITIES. AND THOSE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES IN OUR STATE. I I'M SECURE AS WELL AS QUESTION I'M SURE THE OPPOSITION WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM BUT I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS THIS FINAL QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR AND HIS TEAM. IT'S ABOUT DRUG COSTS NOT INCLUDED HERE SINCE THAT'S REALLY ONE OF THE THINGS ONE OF THE OTHER COSTS THAT CONSUMERS OFTEN FEEL THE PINCH. ON WHY THEY'RE NOT INCLUDED AND THEN JUST ABOUT THE. THIS IS A QUESTION DO YOU AND TO THE OPPOSITION ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF THE COMMISSION ITSELF. MUCH HAS BEEN SAID THAT THIS COMMISSION CAN NOT PROPERLY SET RATES. IN A WAY THAT KEEPS THE PACE WITH THIS INDUSTRY I WOULD LIKE YOU TO ADDRESS THAT AND IF THE OPPOSITION WOULD ADDRESS THAT I'M SURE YOU CAN ADDRESS THE PIECE ABOUT. UP MEDI CAL RATES AS IT RELATES TO. A PRIVATE PRACTICE THANK YOU. THEM IN SO. THE OTHER CHALLENGES I THINK IT AND MANY IN THE LEGISLATURE HAVE FACED A BECAUSE I KNOW. MANY OF THE LEGISLATURE. HAVE GRAPPLED WITH THE ISSUE OF. PERCEPTION DRUGS. AND PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS. SO THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF THE COMMERCE CLAUSE OF OF WHAT WE CAN DO BUT I DO BELIEVE THROUGH THIS BILL WE CAN DO MORE THAN WE'VE EVER DONE BEFORE. AND SOME OF THE POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT. MOVED FROM THE CHAIR AND HIS STAFF THAT WE ARE ACCEPTING A DOES EVEN FURTHER THAN THE LANGUAGE BEING CLUED IN TERMS OF JUST DOING A REPORT. ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS BUT I ACTUALLY FINDING WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN DETERMINE METHODS OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY CAN ACT ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. SO ONE OF THE KEY THINGS ABOUT THIS COMMISSION THE OPPORTUNITY PROVIDES RATHER THAN HAVING US AS MUCH AS I BUT I BELIEVE IN ALL OF US HERE. DECIDE HOW MUCH WEIGHT SHOULD BE AND DECIDE WHAT THE COSTS RIDERS ARE IS TO GET EXPERTS AND GET A COMMISSION HAVE A EXPERTS ON THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE ADVICE COMMISSION HAD EXPERTS STAFFS. STOP THAT IS WHAT'S GOING TO HELP US DETERMINE WHAT THE HEALTH OF THE DRIVERS OF HEALTH COSTS ARE AND AND CONTAIN THEM NOT CUT THEM NOT SLASH THEM CONTAINED THEM. AND IT'S GONNA. UP AND IT'S GOING UP I'M. ALLOW US TO IDENTIFY AND SHINE A LIGHT ON THOSE AREAS THAT WHETHER WE HAVE CONTROL OVER AND NOT. EXPOSE THEM UNSELFISHLY THE PHARMACEUTICALS AND SHOULD YOUR DRUGS WILL BE DID SB SEVEN TWO LAST YEAR IS A GREAT START. BUT THROUGH THIS COMMISSION WE CAN FURTHER EXPOSED THAT'S THE THOUGH TRUE COST DRIVER. AND IT'S NOT THE DOCTORS IN THIS OP HOSPITALS THAN GREAT YOU KNOW WHAT THE RATES ARE GONNA CHANGE THE DOCTORS A HOSPITAL SO MUCH. AND WE CAN THEN TURN OUR ATTENTION AND FOCUS ON THAT BUT WHICH DOES AFFECT THE RATES. AS TO. AND THE FIRST QUESTION WAS POSED A QUESTION ABOUT ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF THE KID AND I COMMISSION I THINK A LOT'S BEEN SAID THAT THIS COMMISSION CAN'T PROPERLY SET RATES ARE THAT WILL FALL BEHIND OUR THAT APPEALS WILL BE. SORT OF UNREAL THE. SURE THIS NINE MEMBER COMMISSION. IF YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT SURE IT'S IDEA BEHIND THIS IS THAT IT WOULD BE A LIVING WAGE. AND BEFORE WE EVEN GOT TO RATES WE DO TAKE A LEAST THREE YEARS. OF A IN GETTING DATA. AND AND GETTING REAL DATA THAT WE CAN USE TO HELP TO ESTABLISH THE RATES ONCE RATES ARE SET THE REEVALUATED EVERY YEAR THEY ARE JUST OF EVERY YEAR COST LIVING GO DIG INTO GENERAL COST OF LIVING INCREASES. THINKING TO RATES OF THE UNCERTAIN SYSTEMS I JUST DID A LABOR AGREEMENT AND COST ONE UPPER ONE AT ONE SEGMENT OF THE LABOR FORCE. AND SO IT'S A LIVING COMMISSION. THAT'S NOT A COMMISSION IS GOING TO LOOK AT EVERY FIVE YEARS IT'S AN ANNUAL REVIEW AT AND THEN ANNUAL ADJUSTMENT OF RATES. I'M DEFICIT OBSERVED. MISTER MISTER BY MAY. SO EAT DE. THE CASSETTE COMMISSION GOVERNANCE WAS VERY MUCH BASED ON SUCCESSFUL MODELS THAT COVER CALIFORNIA. SO WHICH IS INDEPENDENT. HAS STRONG CONFLICT OF OF INTEREST STANDARDS. AND IS MADE UP OF EXPERTS EXPERTS IN HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND HEALTH CARE ECONOMICS IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT AREAS AND ACTUALLY BASED ON SOME OF THE EXPERIENCE IN MARYLAND OF HAVING. AN INDEPENDENT BOY THAT HAS BUILT FLEXIBILITY INDEPENDENCE AND AUTHORITY TO REACT THE CHANGES IN THE MARKET. AND TO SET RATES. WITH THE GUIDANCE THAT THE LEGISLATURE SETS OUT IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY WANT TO SEE ADJUSTMENTS FOR. BUT HAS THAT EXPERTISE AND INDEPENDENCE THE OTHER THING IS IS THAT THERE IS AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE. WHICH IS REQUIRED TO ME AND GIVE ADVICE AND INPUT TO THAT COMMISSION THAT IS MADE UP OF MEMBERS OF THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY THEIR VOICES ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT IN SETTING THESE RATES. AND THE AUTHOR IS ACCEPTING AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD ADD EVEN. MORE PROVIDERS LIKE SPECIFY PROVIDERS SUCH AS PRIMARY CARE DOCTORS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH I'M A SOLO PRACTITIONER. BECAUSE THAT IS AN IMPORTANT VOICE SO ALL OF THAT WILL BE PART OF THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE EXPERTS ON THE COMMISSION. AND IN SETTING THE PACE AMOUNTS THE COMMISSION WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT WRITTEN TESTIMONY THERE WILL BE A PROCESS WHERE THE STAKEHOLDERS GO IN AND TALK ABOUT. WHY CERTAIN RATES NEED TO BE A CERTAIN WAY SO ALL OF THAT IS IS BAKED INTO THE PROCESS? AND THERE'S GUIDANCE INTO WHAT WHAT THEY NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT SO IT HAS INDEPENDENCE BUT HAS GUARD RAILS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS. AFFECTED UPS AND THEN ALSO WITH THE GLOBAL CAP THAT IS BASICALLY AWAY FOR THE COMMISSION TO KIND OF TRACK ARE THEIR SPIKES IN PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ARE THEIR SPIKES IN. VOLUME ARE THERE OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE GOING ON THAT THIS COMMISSION NEEDS TO LOOK AT THAT WOULD CAUSE THERE TO BE AN ADJUSTMENT IN THE BASE AMOUNT. AND SO THAT'S THE IDEA BEHIND THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE. THANK YOU KNOW THROUGH THE CHAIR IF IF THE OPPOSITION TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE MEDI CAL STUFF. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MRS THURMAN APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY RESPOND. FIRST OF ALL THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF INTERESTING IDEAS PUT OUT ABOUT HOW TO INCREASE MEDI CAL THROUGH THIS BUT THEY'RE NOT IN THE BILL. THEY'RE JUST SIMPLY NOT IN THE BILL. AS FAR AS THE. WHETHER OR NOT COMMERCIAL RATES REALLY OFFSET LOSSES. COME TO MY OFFICE COME TO THE DOCTORS AROUND ME. THE ONLY REASON I CAN SEE MEDI CAL PATIENTS IS BECAUSE I TAKE COMMERCIAL RATES. I WOULD BE OUT OF BUSINESS AND IN FACT. TWO THOUSAND SEVEN I SHUT MY DOOR TO THE FEE FOR SERVICE MEDICARE PROGRAM. BECAUSE I WAS ONE OF THE LAST THE ANTI PHYSICIANS IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY STILL SEEING THOSE FOLKS. AND THEY WERE BANKRUPTING MAY BECAUSE I COULDN'T SEE COMMERCIAL PATIENTS TO OFFSET MY LOSSES. SO IT IS SIMPLY TRUE. THAT THERE IS AN OFFSET THAT THE STATE IS PUTTING ON THE COMMERCIAL RATES. WE CAN GIVE YOU THE DATE I'M SURE. AS FAR AS COMMENTS HERE ABOUT THE CONSOLIDATION DRIVING UP COSTS. THIS BILL WOULD INCREASE CONSOLIDATION DOCTORS LIKE MYSELF IN THE LATTER PART OF OUR PRACTICES AND I WILL TELL YOU I WILL BE ONE OF THOSE DOCTORS WILL LOOK TO AN EARLY RETIREMENT. I PRACTICE THIRTY YEARS I COULD PROBABLY PRACTICE ANOTHER FIVE TO TEN. AS A SOLO PRACTITIONER MY ONLY OPTIONS UNDER THIS BILL ASSUMING THAT WE SEE THE SAME BEHAVIORS BY THE LEGISLATURE SETTING RIGHT OR THIS. THIS WITH A PANEL SETTING RIGHTS. WOULD BE TO JOIN A LARGER ORGANIZATION FURTHER INCREASING CONSOLIDATION. OR CLOSE MY PRACTICE CONSOLIDATION DRIVES UP PRICES. THAT IS NOT WHERE WE WANT TO PUSH PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. IN TERMS OF HOW THIS COMMISSION WOULD WORK TO WATCH AND MAKE SURE THESE ARE REASONABLE RATES DEALING WITH INCREASED LABOR COSTS AND INCREASE INFLATION. LET ME REMIND EVERYBODY IN THE ROOM ABOUT SOMETHING CALLED THE SG ARE. AND THE DOC FIX THAT WE HAD TO GO AFTER EVERY YEAR FOR A DECADE. BECAUSE MEDICARE WAS ALSO GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THOSE THINGS AND NEVER DID. FORTUNATELY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAD A LITTLE BIT MORE SPARE CASH THEN THE STATE HAS NEVER COME UP WITH. TO MAKE UP FOR THOSE LOSSES YEAR AFTER YEAR AND KEEP DOCTORS OFFICE OPEN. FOR MEDICARE AND I WILL REMIND ALSO THAT THERE ARE COUNTIES IN THIS STATE. THAT COULD NOT HAVE THAT THERE WAS NO PATIENT ENTERING MEDICARE. THAT COULD FIND OPPOSITION ACCEPTING THEM PARTICULARLY IN SPECIALTIES LIKE ORTHOPEDICS BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY DIDN'T COVER THE COSTS OF CARE THE DOCTORS WERE NOT WILLING TO SEE MEDICARE LET ALONE MEDIC CALATHUS RATES. IN TERMS OF GLOBAL BUDGETING. IF WE DON'T INCLUDE PHARMA. IN ANY PART OF THIS BILL. HOW DO U. GLOBALLY BUDGET AND NOT END UP CUTTING PAYMENT? TO PHYSICIANS HOSPITALS DENTISTS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WHEN FORMA INCREASES ARE STILL OUT OF CONTROL. FINALLY THE IDEA OF AN APPEALS PROCESS. MANY OF YOU ARE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH INDEPENDENT DISPUTE RESOLUTION THAT'S COME UP MANY TIMES BEFORE. IT IS A FAILED PROCESS IN MANY WAYS BECAUSE INDIVIDUAL PRACTITIONERS OR EVEN SMALL GROUPS OF PRACTITIONERS SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE TIME AND THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO GO AFTER HEALTH PLANS CURRENTLY. THAT ARE UNDER PAYING CLAIMS OR REFUSING TO PAY REASONABLE CLAIMS FOR MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE. THERE IS NO EXPECTATION THAT SMALLER PRACTICES AND EVEN MEDIUM SIZED PRACTICES ARE GONNA HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL TO GO UP AGAINST THE COMMISSION. THAT HAS AT THIS TIME ORIGINALLY OUT OF NINE MEMBERS KNOW PHYSICIANS. AND NOW MAYBE ONE PHYSICIAN ON A PANEL OF ELEVEN. THERE'S MUCH TO BE DONE BEFORE THIS BILL HAS ANY SENSE TO IT. THANK YOU. AND IF I MAY ADD ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY THE FUNDAMENTAL FLAW HERE IS THAT THIS BILL THIS APPROACH. ATTACKS ONLY ONE ASPECT. SPENDING IN PRICING DOES ADDRESS MEDICARE DOESN'T ADDRESS MEDICAID. WE ARE NOW ON A RACE TO THE BOTTOM. IT ALSO DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. FROM A HOSPITAL ORGANIZATIONS PERSPECTIVE THE PLANNING THAT IS NEEDED. TO OPERATE A SIGNIFICANT ORGANIZATION ONE WHY MEAN BY THAT. IN MARYLAND THE RATE SETTING COMMISSION FOCUSED ON RATES OF INCREASE. THIS PROPOSES TO READ BASS THE RATES AT WHICH HOSPITAL'S PHYSICIANS AND OTHERS ARE SET. FOR AN ORGANIZATION THAT EMPLOYS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS. THAT HAS TO PLAN NOT ONLY FOR THE CARE THEY'RE PROVIDING TODAY BUT THE CARE THEY'RE GOING TO BE PROVIDING IN FIVE TO TEN YEARS WITH BOARDS OF TRUSTEES FROM THE COMMUNITY WHO GOVERN THOSE DECISIONS. THEY CAN'T WAIT TO NO THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS AT A TIME. WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE PAID FOR THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED TO PROVIDE SO THIS SYSTEM IS NOT ONLY NOT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE UNDERLYING COSTS OF CARE? LABOR DRUGS AND ALL THE REST THE DEGREE OF SUBSIDY THAT'S NEEDED. AND AS THE PROPONENTS HAVE ARGUED IF YOU'RE A HOSPITAL TREATING THE LARGE NUMBERS OF MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PATIENTS. THEY HAVE NO PATIENCE TO SHIFT THOSE UNFUNDED COSTS TO AND THEIR WORKING DAY BY DAY TO MAKE ENDS MEET BUT THE SYSTEM CERTAINLY DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE PLANNING. THAT'S NEEDED TO TAKE CARE DELIVERY WHERE WE NEED IT TO BE. IN MARYLAND ONE OF THE FLAWS OF THE RATE SETTING SYSTEM IS THAT MARYLAND HAD AN OLDER. SET OF CAPITAL OLDER HOSPITALS OLDER FACILITIES BECAUSE IT WASN'T UNTIL THE RATE SETTING COMMISSION RELEASED FUNDS. THAT HOSPITALS COULD THEN PLANET TEN YEAR CYCLE. OF REPLACING THAT PHYSICAL PLANT SO THERE IS MUCH TO BE LEARNED I BELIEVE FROM THE SYSTEMS THAT ARE OUT THERE THIS BILL DOES NOT DO. MAKES YOU WON'T ANSWER MY QUESTIONS WAS INTERESTING ABOUT COUNT. LABOR COSTS DRUG COSTS IN OTHER COSTS BUT THE AUTHOR DID SAY THAT THE STRUCTURE CREATES A WAY TO ADDRESS POTENTIAL DRUG COSTS IN THE STATE. AND HAS BUILT IN A WAY TO ADDRESS WITH LABOR COSTS AND SO I THINK WHAT'S CHALLENGING IS THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM TWO SIDES ON THE SAME ISSUES AND THEY'RE CITING DIFFERENCE THAT'S DATA. BUT A BUT THE AUTHOR DID ADDRESS THAT THERE'S A WAY TO ADDRESS LABOR COSTS IN DRUG COSTS AND SO. CLEARLY THERE'S SOME CHALLENGES HERE BUT I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING CREATIVE TO WORK WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT WHEN I THINK BOTH SIDES THREE QUESTIONS YOU CREATIVELY. TO BIGELOW. THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR. I FIND IT. LIKE MANY MEMBERS HERE A KIND OF. IF USING SCENARIO HERE. AND WHEN I TRIED TO LOOK AT THIS AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PROVIDERS. BOTH INDIVIDUAL AND HOSPITALS. THAT ARE GOING TO BE. THAT'S GONNA BE A STAGGERING NUMBER WHO ALL HAVE INDIVIDUAL SOCIO ECONOMIC. CHALLENGES. DOES YOUR. I'LL CONTEMPLATE. A SEPARATELY. PAYMENT PROGRAM FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL DOCTOR AND HEALTH PLAN. YEAH DOT NODDED FOR EVERY INDIVIDUAL DOCTOR. THEN HOW WILL THEY BE ABLE HOW WILL ANY SUCCESS COME FROM THIS IF YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. THE LABOR COSTS THE AND THE PATIENT LOAD. WHAT WE DO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT? ITALIAN HOW IN THE* SO. AS MENTIONED A COUPLE TIMES LABOR COSTS ARE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE ADJUSTED IN THE BASE ADJUSTMENT NOT EVEN AN APPEAL. BUT ACTUALLY A BASS ADJUSTMENT AND THEIR. IS A LARGE SCALE OPERATION HAS A LOT OF LABOR WHERE THEY DO THEY HAVE A BARGAINING UNIT. AND THE CONTRACTS WE APPLAUD THAT CAN BE FACTORED IN TO A RATE INCREASE OF THAT INDIVIDUAL BUT. BUT IT'S JUST LIKE RIGHT NOW IF I CAN BUY DIFFER ON HOW MEDICARE WORKS HOW MEDICARE RATES ARE SET ALREADY HAS NOT LET EVERY DOCTOR HAS INDIVIDUAL MEDICARE WAIT THEY GET. IT'S ALSO BASE OUR REGION SPACE ON COST ADJUSTMENT OR WHAT HAVE YOU RIGHT BEFORE YOU RESPOND THAT CLEARLY IT'S A ONE ONE SIZE FITS ALL. CURRENTLY AND WHAT YOU'RE OPENING THE DOOR TO IS A TENS OF THOUSANDS SOLUTION FOR A PLAN. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE CONFLICT BUILT INTO THIS AND. AND I KNOW YOU WANT RESPOND TO THAT BUT WITH ONLY NINE MEMBERS INCREASING GET ELEVEN. IS A REALLY GOING TO BE ENOUGH. ABILITY FOR THIS COMMISSION TO ADDRESS THAT MAGNITUDE OF AN ISSUE A CHALLENGE. IT'S IS A MAJOR ENDEAVOR AND THAT'S WHY IT WILL BE UP OF FUNDED COMMISSION TO ALLOW STAFF STARTUP TO THAT ADVISORY COMMITTEE. TO HELP PROVIDE INFORMATION ALLOW FOR A PROCESS IS SET BOTH BASE RATES ADJUSTED RATES AND ALLOW FOR AN APPEALS PROCESS AS WELL. AYE IF THERE'S. A PARTICULAR NEED IT IS A DOCTOR. BUT A COUNTRY TO STOP THE NEEDS THAT THEY HAVE UP FACILITIES ISSUES BUT THEY HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR. THOSE ARE ALL THINGS ARE VERY INDIVIDUALIZED THAT FRANKLY RIGHT NOW. IT'LL GET COMPENSATED FOR THAT THE TAKE THAT OUT OF THEIR OWN GENERAL FUND OF THEIR ALL OF THEIR OPERATIONS. AND SO AND THEIR DOCTORS SUCH AS THE OUR OUR GOOD DOT HERE THE RIGHT TESTIFIED SAYING. YOU KNOW THE COMMERCIAL RATES. HELP ME TO OFFSET OUR MEDICARE MEDICAL MEDICARE MEDICAL RATES WELL THEN WHO THE ACTOR THAT CAN. BE ANNOUNCED SO IF THAT'S THE CASE IN THE REGION HE PRACTICES. THEN THAT COULD VERY WELL BE WHAT COMMERCIAL RATES ARE SET THAT THIS IS NOT ABOUT. CUTTING AYE I KNOW THAT. THERE THERE WAS A SUGGEST THAT WE'RE GONNA RE BASS. BUT THE RATES ARE THE REALITY IS WE BATES IS NOT EQUAL REDUCE. AND SO ON UP TO A DEFERRED TO THIS AREA HERE ON THE POINT OF HOW YOU ACCOUNT FOR INDIVIDUAL INDIVIDUAL ICONS GIVEN THE FACT THAT MEDICARE DOESN'T DO THAT. BUT HOW WITH THIS ACCOUNT FOR LOCALIZED DIFFERENCES IN CLASS. IT'S A BIGELOW THAT'S AND AN EXCELLENT QUESTION AND I THINK WHEN WE. AND WE'RE CONTEMPLATING WHAT THE AUTHOR THE STRUCTURE OF THIS BILL WE REALIZE THAT THERE IS A TRIED AND TRUE FORMULA OUT THERE WHICH IS THE WORKHORSE OF MEDICARE. WE REALIZED WE DID NOT NEED A COMMISSION TO REINVENT THE WHEEL AND SAT AS YOU SAID TEN THOUSAND DIFFERENT. RATES FOR ALL THE PROVIDERS IN THE STATE ESPECIALLY A STATE AS LARGE AS AS CALIFORNIA. THE MEDICARE SYSTEM DOES THE WORK FOR US AND THAT'S WHY MEDICARE IS USED AS THE BENCHMARK IN THE BASIS FOR THE COMMISSION TO SET RATES. MEDICARE TAKES INTO ACCOUNT COST THE COST OF CARE LABOR COSTS IT DOES ADJUSTMENTS FOR REGIONAL WAGE DIFFERENCES IT LOOKS THAT IF A FACILITY DOES MEDICAL EDUCATION. IF THEY ALL HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF MEDICAID OUT OR LOW INCOME BENEFICIARIES AND EVEN DOES AN ADDITIONAL PAYMENT IF THERE'S AN OUT LIAR CASE IF THERE HAPPENS TO BE A CASE WHERE. IT IS VERY VERY EXPENSIVE. EVEN DEALS WITH CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITALS THOSE ARE HOSPITALS I BELIEVE THERE'S THIRTY FOUR IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT ARE IN. RURAL AREAS AND THEIR SMALL HOSPITALS THAT REALLY ARE THE ONLY SOURCE OF CARE FOR MEDICARE ENROLLEES AND SO A LOT OF THAT WORK IS DONE. AND SO MEDICAID PROVIDERS WHO ACCEPT MEDICARE. KNOWWHAT THAT IS AND THE COMMISSION IS GOING TO USE THAT AS THE BASIS. TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAKE SENSE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND FOR THE VARIOUS THINGS THAT ARE BUILT INTO. THE BELL I MEAN. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE RATES ALLOW FOR STATE LAW REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS TIMELY ACCESS LANGUAGE ACCESS AND NETWORK ADULTS ADEQUACY. THOSE ARE ALL EXISTING STATE LAWS THAT ARE NOT GOING TO DISAPPEAR THE BASE RATES HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE. THE OTHER THING IS IS THAT IN CALIFORNIA FORTY PERCENT OF MEDICARE ENROLLEES ARE IN MEDICARE ADVANTAGE. THE REASON THAT'S SO IMPORTANT IS THAT IN CALIFORNIA WE DO HAVE A VERY UNIQUE. DELEGATED MODEL. WE HAVE INTEGRATED SYSTEMS LIKE KAISER THAT HAVE DONE INCREDIBLE WORK. AND REALLY DO SOME VALUE BASED CARE. THE INTENT OF AB THIRTY EIGHTY SEVEN IS NOT TO DISRUPT THAT MODEL. WE DID NOT WANT TO DISRUPT THE WORK THAT CALIFORNIA HAS DONE TO GET TO VALUE BASED CARE. AND SO THE BILL VERY CLEARLY USES MEDICARE ADVANTAGE. AND A PERCENTAGE OF MEDICARE ADVANTAGE RISK ADJUSTED OF COURSE FOR THE TO HER POPULATION TO BE ABLE TO SET THE CAPITATED PAYMENTS TO HEALTH PLANS. IT DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH THE CONTRACTS RELATIONSHIPS THAT HEALTH PLANS HAVE WITH CONTRACTED PROVIDERS IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO US ESPECIALLY WITH THE LABOR MOVEMENT HAVING SIXTY FIVE PERCENT ENROLLMENT IN KAISER PLANS. BUT THAT WOULDN'T DISRUPT THIS MODEL AND SO JUST TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION A LOT OF THE WORK IS DONE BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND THE COMMISSION WILL ADJUST FOR THE REALITIES TO CALIFORNIA. SO WHEN WHEN I HEAR THAT. I'M I'M. ALMOST HEARING IS STILL A ONE SIZE FITS ALL. PLATFORM. AND WHAT'S WRITTEN IN THE BILL. WHICH WAS TO GIVE. MOST PEOPLE IN UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME. OFF RAMPS FOR UNDERSTANDING HOW TO APPEAL THAT'S ALMOST OFF THE TABLE BECAUSE WE'RE A GONNA BE PREDETERMINED. SO I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED MAYBE THE OPPOSITION. SINCE YOU COMMENTED A MAYBE YOU CAN MAYBE ADDRESS THAT. IF YOU'RE ME YES PLEASE THANK YOU SOME WOMEN UP THE BILL DOES CONTEMPLATE SETTING DIFFERENT RATES FOR DIFFERENT HOSPITALS AND DIFFERENT PHYSICIAN GROUPS IT'S RIGHT THERE IN THE BILL AT THE COMMISSION DOES HAVE THE POWER TO SET. DIFFERENT RATES FOR DISINFORMATION GROUPS IN THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC AREA OF THE FACT THAT WE'RE SAYING THAT MEDICARE RT TAKE THIS INTO ACCOUNT FOR ONE. OF THERE'S A LOT OF PROBLEMS AND MEDICARE ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT WHEN THEY WOULD ZONE DIFFERENT COUNTIES AS URBAN OR OR RURAL. IT AS A MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WE'VE WE'VE HAD A LOT OF TROUBLE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. MAKING SURE THAT THAT MEDICARE RATES ARE SET AT ESTABLISHED LEVEL BUT TO YOUR QUESTION OF WHETHER THIS IS THE ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH TO TO US THERE'S JUST A FULL DELEGATION THE COMMISSION THE COMMISSION COULD SET ONE WAY IF THEY WANTED TO. OR THEY COULD SAID DIFFERENT RATE FOR EVERY POSITION A POSITION GROUP IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO THERE REALLY IS NO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION BECAUSE IT'S ALL DELEGATED TO THE COMMISSION AND THE COMMISSION SHALL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THESE DIFFERENT ITEMS BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY. WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY GET IT WRONG A ACCESS TO CARE THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM REALLY GETS HURT AND SO? I THINK FOR FOR OUR ASSOCIATION THE THE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE IS NO EASY ANSWERS ARE NO THESE QUESTIONS CAN BE ANSWERED. IN FACT THEY LEAVE THE ANSWERS TO THE COMMISSION AND AGAIN AT ELEVEN PEOPLE WE HAVE ONE POSITION ON THERE UP MOST OF IT WOULD SAY IS IS. TILTED TOWARD PURCHASERS THERE'S A REPRESENT OF LABOR UNIONS IN THERE'S ACTUALLY EVEN INTERVENOR FEES OR SOME PROPONENT OF BILL CASTIGATE WITNESS AN ADVOCACY FEES TO. LOBBYING FROM THE COMMISSION SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONFIDENCE THAT ELEVEN PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY SET THE RATE FOR ALL THE PROVIDERS IN THE HOSPITAL IN OUR IN OUR STATE. SO HELP ME. HAVING HEARD THAT MAYBE SOMEONE CAN ADDRESS THAT THERE IS A SECTION IN THE BILL. AND IN FACT IT'S ONE ZERO ZERO SIX POINT I'M SIX ONE ZERO POINT. A. THAT WOULD ALLOW THE COMMISSION TO WORK MONEY TO ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS. WHAT ORGANIZATIONS AND FOR WHAT PURPOSES? MAYBE YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT YEAH AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE AGREED TO TAKE ON THE. SUGGESTION UP FROM THE CHAIR. BUT TO CAP HOW MUCH TO BE SPENT ON THAT OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR. AND SO. THAT'S. THE PPP. SO ANNA. THE MATRIX THE ITS THE. PURCHASE A PARTICIPATION PROGRAMS SOME OF THE NEW COMPANY POLICY COMIC JUST SAYS SIMPLY PPP. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE STAFF REPORT UNDER PAGE TWENTY FIVE THEIR SUGGESTION. TO BOTH SUNSET. THE TO SUNSET THE PROGRAM AND TO HAVE A CAP AS TO HOW MUCH CAN BE SPENT. EVERY YEAR ON THAT THOSE SUGGESTION I KNOW THERE'S BEEN I'VE SEEN SOME OPPOSITION LETTERS OR SUGGEST MILLIONS TO CAN GO TO SO I'LL GREG. GROUP A YEAR TO LOBBY RIGHT. EXPLICITLY OF SEEKING TO LIMIT THAT FOR A THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND A SON SENATE PROVIDE YEARS THE REASON WHY IS THAT IS THOSE EARLY YEARS THAT. WE. WOULD REQUIRE INPUT AND SOME OF THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. IS JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THEIR PROPERTY BUT FOR SOME THE THE. THINK TANKS AND OTHERS THAT CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION IS NOT UNIQUE THEIR OTHER COMMISSIONS IN THE SAME THING. IN FACT AN EXCUSE ME IF I MAY DONE IT'S MODELED OFF OF THE INTERVENOR PROGRAM FOR FOR EXAMPLE THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE WHERE GROUPS LIKE HEALTH ACCESS. THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORKING CONSUMERS UNION. DO GET FEES FOR. AT PETITIONING ON ON ISSUES SUCH AS TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE ON BEHALF OF CONSUMERS AND SO THE INTENTION HERE IS TO REPLICATE SUCCESSFUL SYSTEM THAT WE'VE SEEN IN OTHER AREAS OF POLICY MAKING. HOMELESS ALWAYS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER AND. AND UNDERSTOOD BUT THERE'S ALWAYS. THE STORIES THAT WE WERE TOLD AND TAUGHT. IF YOU ONLY HEAR ONE SIDE. YOU DON'T HAVE A FIRM BALANCED. APPROACH TO MAKE IT AN INFORMED DECISION. SO SHOULDN'T THERE BE AN ABILITY TO HAVE BOTH SIDES PRESENTED. AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO PRESENT ONE SIDE WITH THE ABILITY WITH FUNDING XIN THE OTHER SIDE GET THE SAME LEVEL. OF ATTENTION AND ABILITY WELL THERE'S AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND I'M I'M HAPPY TO HAVE OUR. SPONSORS HERE SPEAK ABOUT THERE'S AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT'S CHOCK FULL OF EXPERTS FROM ALL CROSS INDUSTRY. I CLUED IN FROM SMALLER PRACTICES AND EVEN ADDING IN THE RURAL COMMUNITIES AS WELL. AND SO THERE'S GONNA BE A PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY FOR FEEDBACK THE REASON WHY. THAT PARTICULAR. THE BOTTOM IS IN THERE IS THAT. THE AVERAGE CONSUMER. DOESN'T HAVE EXPERTS TO COME IN X. IF IT WERE NOT FOR THESE NONPROFITS TO COME IN AND SPEAK ON THEIR BEHALF OF WHILE OTHER ASPECTS OF THE INDUSTRY INCLUDING LABOR INCLUDING. THE DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS THEY HAD ADVOCACY THEY HAVE LOBBYING THEY HAVE ABA EXPERTS THAT CAN PROVIDE DATA TO THE. COMMISSION IS SO IT'S IT'S JUST TO PROVIDE THE CONSUMER PERSPECTIVE THAT OTHERWISE WOULD NOT BE THERE. OR MAYBE. BOTH SCIENCE STILL AREN'T BEING RESENTED. WITH A PERSPECTIVE FROM TWO DIFFERENT. DECISION. AND. BECAUSE YOU GOT EXPERTS ON THIS SITE. DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT ALL EXPERTS ARE PRESENT. TO PUT GIVE THE INFORMATION THAT THERE'S A THERE'S A ROBUST ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT'S FULL OF TONS OF FOLKS FROM ACROSS INDUSTRY I'M HAPPY TO GO THROUGH EACH ONE IS LISTED IN. A IN THERE'S LAWS WITH THE AMENDMENTS BUT THERE THERE'S PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY FOR EXPERTISE FROM INDUSTRY TO PROVIDE INPUT THOSE LAWS A HOSPITAL AND A DOCTOR REPRESENTATIVE ON THE COMMISSION. THAT'S NOT REFORM THE INTERVENOR PORTION LET ME LET ME MOVE ON A BECAUSE I DON'T THINK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR BEING SO INDULGENT. ON MAY BE. MAYBE SOMEONE CAN ADDRESS THIS. I UNDERSTAND THAT. ANOTHER STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA HAS HAD A SIMILAR. SET OF RATE SETTING LAWS OF THE COMMERCIAL INSURANCE. BUT IT WAS RECENTLY. REPEAL. MAYBE YOU CAN ADDRESS THAT. WHY? CAN SOMEONE UP THERE IS AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO AND JUST THAT HISTORY HERE. RATE SETTING. WAS EXPERIMENTED WITH STARTING ABOUT FORTY YEARS AGO THERE WERE ORIGINALLY FIVE STATES THAT HAD RATE SETTING PROGRAMS. WEST VIRGINIA WAS DIFFERENT BECAUSE WEST VIRGINIA ORIGINALLY ONLY HAD RATE SETTING FOR THE PRIVATE INSURANCE SIDE THEY WERE UNABLE. TO GET THE WAIVERS NECESSARY TO DO RATE SETTING ON THE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SIDE OF THE EQUATION. ALL OF THE OTHER STATES LET RATE SETTING GO BY THE WAYSIDE AND THE REASON THAT WEST VIRGINIA. HAS NOW BEEN BATTLING FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND WAS SUCCESSFUL IN UP REMOVING RATE SETTING IS BECAUSE OF THOSE OTHER TWO BARS. SO THEY'RE EXPERIENCING EXACTLY THE CHALLENGE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT IS WHEN THEY MOVED TO RATE SETTING MEDICARE AND MEDICAID. REIMBURSING IT COST AS MEDICARE AND MEDICAID AND FEDERAL AND STATE BUDGET PRESSURES ABOUT GREW. AS THOSE RATES WENT BELOW COST THEY COULDN'T JUST SET RATES FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR IT RESULTED IN LOSSES. AND THAT'S WHEN THE HOSPITAL COMMUNITY IN PARTICULAR IN THE STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA MOUNTED AN EFFORT TO HAVE IT REPEAL THE MORE SUCCESS. SO AS WE SEE THIS STORY INTO A FACT WE CAN START TO SEE HOW WHAT'S BEING PRESENTED HERE. IT IS COMING BACK TO A ONE SIZE FITS. ALL WITH LITTLE OPPORTUNITY FOR INJECTION. AND WE ALREADY KNOW THAT MANY OF THE PEOPLE. THAT ARE TRYING TO PROVIDE HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO EVERYONE. THAT DEBT THAT ARE IN NEED AND I REPRESENT THAT RULE AREA THAT YOU. SPEAK ABOUT AND I KNOW IT VERY DEARLY WHEN MOST MY DOCTORS. OR A CLOTHES SHOP BECAUSE THEY CAN'T. STAND BUSINESS IT'S BEEN VERY CHALLENGING. BUT. I FIND IT JUST PERPLEXING HERE THAT THERE'S SO MANY OPEN ENDED QUESTIONS. THAT WERE TRYING TO PUSH A BILL FORWARD. WHEN IS STILL NEEDS MORE TIME TO BE. ADDRESSED. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I STILL THINK THAT ARE OF CONCERN TO THIS. IS WHEN WE LOOK AT SOME OF THE. SOME OF THESE PLANS. ARE FROM OUT OF STATE AND BY OTHER STATES ARE NOT GOING TO BE MANDATED. UNDER THE SAME TERMS AND CONDITIONS AS THE ONES WITHIN THE STATE HOW COULD YOU ADDRESS THAT FOREST TODAY. MISTER BIGELOW IS YOUR QUESTION AROUND HEALTH PLANS THAT ARE OUT OF STATE HEALTH PLANS YEAH. THE REASON THAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON. REGULATING DOCTORS HOSPITALS AND HEALTH PLANS. AND HAVE. COMMISSION IS DIRECTED TO LOOK AT PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IS BECAUSE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE CAN REGULATE HEALTH PLANS DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS. WE CANNOT. PRESCRIPTIONDRUGS BECAUSE THERE'S FEDERAL PREEMPTION AND THERE'S THE COMMERCE CLAUSE AND LOTS OF. LEGAL ISSUES. AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE REASON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ARE OUT BUT. THE STATE HAS THE POWER TO REGULATE HEALTH PLANS AND SO THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO. DO IF THEY ARE SELLING IN CALIFORNIA THAN THEY ARE REGULATED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. CAN. SO WE CAN'T WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT OUR STATE ENTITIES BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE CERTAIN THINGS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND NOT BE REGULATED. AND GET A DIFFERENT VALUE. ON RETURN. NO THE PLANTS THAT ARE PROVIDE AIR IN CALIFORNIA ARE REGULATED EVERITT THERE HAVE CALIFORNIA ENROLLEES ARE REGULATED BY THE STATE WHEN ASKING A DIFFERENT WAY ARE FEDERAL CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS AS STRONG AS CALIFORNIA BECAUSE. AND WHAT THE CALIPHATE FOR PLANTS THAT ARE REGULATED IN HEALTH PLANS REGULATE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE SUBJECT TO THE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS CALIFORNIA. ARE. OUR PATIENTS PROTECTED FROM A BALANCED BILLING. AB SEVENTY TO WHICH THERE IS CO AUTHORS HERE. PROTECTS CONSUMERS FROM SURPRISE MEDICAL BILLS SO WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A CONFLICT BETWEEN FEDERAL. LAWS AND CALIFORNIA'S. MAYBE YOU GUYS CAN MAYBE IT GOT YOU'RE REFERRING TO ADDRESS A PLAN. I CANNOT I CAN REFER TO IT AS A RESULT YEAH I WANT TO NAME ANY. IS THAT WE DON'T GET IT TO COME. YEAH THERE'S A LOT OF A LOT OF AND EMPLOYERS HAVE ARE SELF INSURED A LOT OF UNIONS HAVE LABOR MANAGEMENT TRUST FUNDS. THOSE ARE SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS A RISK APPLY ANSWER TAPPED PARTIES OR SELF INSURED PLANS. THOSE ARE REGULATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR UNDER SOMETHING CALLED THE RISA. AND ARISTA PLANS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE BUT THE WAY THAT THIS BILL IS CRAFTED IS THAT RISA PLANS CAN OPT IN TO HAVING THE RATES THAT ARE AT THE BASE AMOUNTS THAT ARE SET BY THE COMMISSION. BUT IT DOES NOT IN ANY WAY IMPOSE UPON OR REGULATE SELF INSURED AGGRESSIVE PLANS BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE PREEMPTED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU COULD YOU MAYBE ADDRESS THAT  <u><c.green>ES DE ANOTHER</c></u> CONCERN THAT WE HAVE THERE'S ABOUT SIX MILLION LIVES CURRENTLY AT THAT ARE ON A RESERVE PLANS OVER SUPPLANTED NOT REGULATED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT MEANS I'M NOT KEEN PROTECTIONS DON'T APPLY TO THEM SO YES THEY COULD. HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF OF BENEFITS STRUCTURE. OF POOR BELOW WHAT CALIFORNIA OFFERS A INDEED THE RESUPPLY ENDS ACTUALLY CAN CAN AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THE RATE SET BY THIS COMMISSION WITHOUT IT HEARING TWENTY THE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THAT AND THAT'S JUST A FACT. OKAY READ MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR GIVING ME A LITTLE EXTRA TIME. WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA MOVE ALONG AND ASK THAT IN FUTURE QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE ONE MEMBER OF THE. UP SUPPORT ONE MEMBER FROM OPPOSITION RESPOND TO THE QUESTION NOT ALL THREE AND SO WE CAN GET WE GOT WE WE NEED TO WE NEED TO GET THROUGH. A LOT MORE BILLS AT TODAY TO AND WE'RE ALMOST TWO HOURS AND OUR DISCUSSION I DO NOT WANT TO LIMIT THE DISCUSSION I THINK THESE ARE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS BUT. QUESTIONS BEEN ANSWERED PLEASE DON'T ASK IT AGAIN. SO THE NEXT PERSON TO ASK GO WILL BE MISSED BURKE AND ON DECK IS MISTER BONTA WON'T. PEOPLE KNOW WHERE THEY ARE IN THE QUEUE SO. SO I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS THERE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME QUESTIONS I ASKED THE SPONSORS WHEN THEY CAME TO MY OFFICE AND THEN I HAVE A COUPLE COMMENTS FOR OPPOSITION I'M MAKING QUESTION STILL CONTINUES TO BE WHAT IS YOUR PROJECTED SAVINGS WITH THIS. PROGRAM AND THEN OR WITH THIS. GROUP AND THEN MY OTHER QUESTION WHICH IS STILL PRAYER THE SAME QUESTION IS EITHER I DO HAVE SOME CONCERN NOT TOO DIFFERENT FROM MR BIGELOW IS THAT THERE'S THIS I'M GETTING THE SENSE AND ACTUALLY MISTER CHAIRMAN AS WELL. IS I'M GETTING THE SENSE THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN A REAL STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AND AND WHAT CONCERNS ME NOW IS THAT. DO YOU HAVE ANY MODELING ON WHAT THE EFFECT THIS WILL HAVE ON HOSPITALS CAN YOU SHOW US. THE ACTUAL BALANCE SHEET OR HOW YOU PROJECT THIS WILL WORK WITH THE FOUR HUNDRED DIFFERENT KINDS OF HOSPITALS THAT WE HAVE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THEN MY NEXT QUESTION IS YOU SAY THIS IS GOING TO ALLOW MORE ACCESS FOR URBAN AND RURAL COMMUNITIES HOWEVER YET I SEE NONE OF THEM HERE SUPPORTING YOU. AND THAT GIVES ME GREAT PAUSE. SO THOSE ARE MY QUESTIONS. FOR THE SUPPORTERS AND THEN I AM A FEW QUESTIONS FOR THE. SO ON THE OVERALL PROJECTED SAVINGS. AND MODELING QUESTION. WE WERE PURPOSEFUL IN NOT SETTING THIS AS A CAP BILL. THERE'S NOT A A SPECIFIC TARGETED MEDICARE RATE THAT WE SET MAY RATES THAT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE APPROACH THERE IS NOT ONE OVERALL SORT OF. SAVINGS NUMBER THAT WE'RE AIMING FOR HERE BECAUSE WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT IS PRUDENT. TO CUT FOR THE SAKE OF CUTTING THERE IS A REASON THAT THIS IS ABOUT BOTH IMPROVING ACCESS AND QUALITY IN HEALTH CARE WHILE ALSO CONSTRAINING UNREASONABLE. PRICE INCREASES THEY'RE NOT TIED TO OUTCOMES THAT ARE NOT TIED TO QUALITY THAT ARE TIED TO UTILIZATION. WE DON'T PRESUME TO KNOW WHAT THAT IS IN A COMPLEX HEALTHCARE MARKET RATHER THE BILL IS VERY MARYLAND INSPIRED. BUT THE BILL SORT OF REVISITS MARILYN'S EXPERIENCE THEY STARTED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE WHEN THE HEALTH CARE ENVIRONMENT WAS QUITE DIFFERENT. AND WE ASK OURSELVES WHAT WOULD MARILYN DO IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE HAVE A SENSE OF THAT THEY ARE LOOKING TO PULL WITHIN THEIR COMMISSION. PHYSICIAN COSTS PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY FEDERAL LAW. AND OUTPATIENT COSTS AND SERVICES INCLUDING OF A GLOBAL CAP. IN MARILYN'S EXPERIENCE THE DID NOT START WITH ALL PEERS THE LAW WAS PASSED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE. AND IT TOOK UNTIL NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN FOR THEM TO GET THE NECESSARY WAIVERS TO PULL IN THE PUBLIC PROGRAMS BUT IT PRECEDED ANYWAY WITH SETTING RATES. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE COST DRIVERS AND HEALTH CARE ARE A FUNCTION OF MUCH MORE THAN HOSPITAL COSTS IN A VACUUM. YOU DO HAVE TO FACTOR IN OTHER COMPONENTS SO THE PART OF THE REASON WHY WE DID THE THE REVIEW OF LITERATURE IN THE OUTCOMES IN THE SUCCESSES AND WHAT WORKED AND WHAT DIDN'T. OVER THE COURSE OF FORTY YEARS AGO. YOU KNOW EXPERIMENT WITH. REGULATING THE INDUSTRY THE REGULATION WORKED ACTUALLY AND IN MARYLAND IT WORKED PARTICULARLY WELL DUE TO THE FLEXIBILITY BECAUSE IT WAS NOT OVERLY PRESCRIPTIVE. BECAUSE IT ALLOWED FOR THE COMMISSION TO SHIFT OVER TIME. THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT WAS FOCUSED SOLELY ON HOSPITALS AND NOT ON THE BROADER HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WHICH THEY ARE NOW TRYING TO FIX. AND SO THE SHORT ANSWER IS IT'S HARD TO GIVE YOU AN ANSWER BECAUSE PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE HERE IS PRECISELY THE OPPOSITE OF ONE SIZE FITS ALL. WE COULD HAVE GONE THAT ROUTE WE DIDN'T WE'RE TRYING TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT ENSURING THAT THIS REALLY IS ABOUT ENSURING ACCESS. AND CORRECTING FOR MARKET FAILURES IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WHICH ARE EVIDENT IN. UNNECESSARY HOSPITAL CLOSURES BECAUSE A PROVIDER CAN'T COMPETE BECAUSE THEY'RE IN A REGION THAT IS TOO POOR. TO ATTRACT PHYSICIANS AND COMMERCIAL PAYMENTS TO IT. SO I DON'T KNOW THAT ANSWER THE QUESTION. HONESTLY I THINK. AND THIS IS A HUGE HIT WITH THE RECORD OF WHAT YOU ARE ASKING FOR IS IS. MONUMENTAL. AND TO NOT HAVE HAD A PROCESS I DON'T THINK YOU DO RESPONDED TO THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS EITHER TO HAVE A PROCESS IN WHICH YOU HAVE NOT INCLUDED STAKEHOLDERS OF WHICH YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED HOSPITALS. AND WORK TOGETHER TO GET TO WHAT ARE THE REALISTIC THERE ARE I MEAN A BALANCE SHEET IS NOT CONJECTURED THAT IS NUMBERS THAT YOU HAVE TO ADD TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT THE RIGHT. TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE MEMBERS ARE PAID WHAT THEY DESERVE TO BE PAID WHICH I BELIEVE IT. SO IT GIVES ME GREAT PAUSE THAT THAT PROCESS HAS NOT HAPPENED IT'S AN IMPORTANT PROCESS WAS AND I DO AT NO ONE LIKES DOING IT IT'S HARD WORK IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME. AND YES IT DOES NOT FALL ALWAYS IN OUR DEADLINES TO DO THINGS IN THIS YEAR BUT WITH SOMETHING THIS BIG IT SHOULD BE WRITTEN IRRESPONSIBILITY. SO THAT IS NOT ONE THAT'S THE FIRST THING I AT GALLAGHER HAD. IF I COULD JUST RESPOND TO THAT THE TWO QUESTIONS WHAT ONE IS ON HOW MUCH YOU EXPECT TO SAY WELL. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE THAT WE WERE ACTUALLY SETTING RATES RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW I CAN TELL YOU WE'RE GONNA SAVE X. BILLIONS X. MILLIONS. AND AND WE'RE GONNA GIVE THIS MUCH ACCESS. THAT IS UP. A FALSEHOOD COULD CHART BUT THERE CHOOSING A NUMBER ENDING THAT WE'RE NOT DOING THAT. IF WE DID THAT ARM THE BILL TO GIVE YOU THOSE ARE THOSE NUMBERS TO BE OUT AS WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT WE THAT'S IDEA OF GETTING EXPERTS. TO ACTUALLY SET THE RATES SET THE BASEMENTS OF THE JUST AMAZED ALLOW THE FLEXIBILITY AT THE END OF THE DAY MAY BE COSTLY FLAT WHERE THEY ARE. AND THEY WON'T GO UP TEN PERCENT A YEAR THE MIKE WHAT THREE PERCENT A YEAR WHICH YOU'RE SUGGESTING IT'S COSTING TOO. YOU'RE SELLING IT AS COST CONTAINMENT AND THAT IS COST CONTAINMENT SO MIKE MINE CURIOUS I GUESS FURTHER AGAIN IS NOT THE QUESTION IS IF IN FACT THIS IS COST CONTAINMENT IN THAN FACT THIS WILL GIVE. MORE ACCESS TO URBAN AND RURAL COMMUNITIES HAVE YOU I MEAN THERE SHOULD BE ONE HOSPITAL THERE SHOULD BE ONE THAT WOULD BE WILLING TO GO THROUGH WITH YOU AND AND AND SEE WHAT THIS ACTUAL PROCESS WOULD LOOK LIKE WITH YOUR EXPERTS. BEFORE WE MOVE THIS BILL INTO ACTION WHAT I'M NOT SURE WHY WE WOULD WHY WE WOULD DO THIS WITHOUT ANY DATA OR ANY ACTUAL ACTUAL NUMBERS AT THIS IS THAT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY. AND WHEN A HOSPITAL IT'S GOING TO GOING TO THE RED BOOK FOR A FIRST OF ALL THERE ARE NUMBER HAAS WAS IN THE BED THEIR NUMBER OF HOSTELS THAT ARE CLOSE INCLUDING MY OWN BACKYARD. ENDS AND SO THAT'S ALREADY HAPPENING BUT I WILL SAY THIS CLUB IS THE TOLL OF THE JIMMY CONCERN. ONE IS A REASON WHY WE PUT INTO PLACE THAT OF THE BILL AND THEN I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR WHO REALLY HARD ON THIS. STRINGENT DATA COLLECTION. AND THAT DATA CLUTCH IS GOING TO HAPPEN WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS IS GOING TO HAPPEN BEFORE WE SET RATES FOR PHYSICIANS. SECONDLY THERE'S A ROBUST ADVISER COMMITTEE THIRD THIS BILL STILL HAS A WAY TO GO AT MY DOOR HAS BEEN OPEN FROM DAY ONE. I'M AND I'M LOOKING AT THE. DOZENS OF LETTERS FROM OPPOSITE LOOK WE WERE GETTING CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OPPOSITION EVEN THOUGH. HAVING SOME COST TEN IT IS GOING TO BE GOOD FOR ALMOST EVERY EMPLOYER IN OUR STATE BUT WE KNOW THAT HOSPITAL'S A LARGE CHRISTIAN GROUPS ARE MEMBERS OF THOSE CHAMBERS. UNLESS WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT WHO'S GOING TO COME TO THE TABLE RIGHT NOW MIGHT DOORS BEEN OPEN IT'S GOING TO BE OPEN TOMORROW JUST AS IT HAS BEEN YESTERDAY. AND I YOU KNOW THAT IF. I WANNA SIT DOWN AND TALK A WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS ON ALL THESE DETAILS IN THE MEANTIME WE'RE TALKING WITH WEBER WILL TALK TO US I'VE TALKED TO PLENTY OF DOCTORS WHO ARE THOUGH UNDER NOT UNDER THE GUISE. OF ORGANIZATIONS WILL CONTACT US OBVIOUSLY THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND PLENTY OF OTHER STAKEHOLDERS THERE YOU WERE PART OF THE OF THE YOUR LONG OF THE OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE HEARINGS WHICH. DID IDENTIFY COST CONTAINMENT. AS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO THIS IS COST CONTAINMENT NOT COST CUTTING. IT'S COST CONTAINMENT SO THAT WE CAN CONTROL THE RATE OF GROWTH IN THE OUT YEARS SO THAT WE CAN HAVE SOME SORT EXPECTATIONS BUT THERE'S NO COST CONTAINMENT. OR ANYTHING THAT WILL GO ON PLACE UNTIL ALL THE DATA IS THERE WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS AT THE TABLE IT REQUIRES IT IN THE BILL. THE BILL ACTUALLY DETAILS WHO NEEDS TO BE AT THE TABLE AND UP WITH THE AMENDMENTS SEVERAL GOING TO BE ADDING ALSO INCLUDES THE DATA PEACE REQUIRES A LEAST THREE YEARS. OF DATA BEFORE WE TOUCH OF ANY POSITION. SO IS THERE A WAY TO COLLECT BACK TO YOU KNOW. BEFORE WE PUT THIS COMMISSION INTO PLAY. THE I MEAN ISN'T THAT SORT OF THE RESPONSIBLE THING TO DO IS TO COLLECT THE DATA FIRST AND THEN MOVE FORWARD WITH THE COMMISSION AND NO WITHOUT COMMISSION REALLY SHOULD LOOK LIKE IMPACT. THE ON THE PHYSICIAN ADD DATA BE IT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALREADY COLLECTS OF ROBUST DATA ON HOSPITALS THROUGH THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING AND AND DEVELOPMENT POSH BUT. SO WE HAVE A LOT THERE ALREADY WE ALSO HAVE A LOT OF DATA THANKS TO THE GOOD WORK OF THE LEAPER FED AND HEALTH ACCESS ON. IT INSURANCE RATE FILINGS IN THE COMMERCIAL MARKET WHAT WE ARE MISSING RIGHT NOW IS PHYSICIAN DATA AND THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN IN THIS COMMITTEE. REQUIRE THAT WE NOT MOVE ON DOING ANYTHING TO SET RATES FOR PHYSICIANS UNTIL THE COMMISSION HAS THAT DATA. SO THAT IT'S ALREADY. NOW IN THE BILL. I AND ONE LAST COMMENT THAT I HAVE QUESTIONS FOR THE OPPOSITION I PROMISE I'LL BE REALLY FAST THINK. AGAIN AGAIN I WOULDN'T I WOULD ASK I WOULD FEEL MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE IF WE WERE COLLECTING THAT DATA BEFORE WE PUT THE COMMISSION INTO PLACE THAT'S JUST A STATEMENT. NOW OUT TO THE OPPOSITION I WILL SAY THE SAME THING I SAID TO YOU IN MY OFFICE WHICH IS THIS IS KIND OF WHAT YOU GET. THIS IS KIND OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU. LEAVE THINGS STATUS QUO WHEN YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. I'M I KNOW YOU MADE A COMMENT THAT YOU'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THIS BUT YOU HAD YEARS TO WORK ON COST CONTAINMENT AND YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT. AND NOW HERE WE ALL IN THIS POSITION DO I LIKE THIS BILL NO. BUT. IS COST CONTAINMENT A SERIOUS ISSUE THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED YES AND THEY DON'T THINK YOU WOULD BE AT THIS TABLE AND I DON'T THINK YOU WOULD ADDRESS IT IF THIS BILL OR SOME OF THE OTHER. ONES WERE HERE. SO I HAVE TO TELL YOU AS MUCH AS I DON'T LIKE THIS. I AM GLAD WE'RE HAVING A CONVERSATION IT'S AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AND IF THIS PUT YOUR FEET TO THE FIRE TO FINALLY DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. THEN I'M HAPPY IT'S HERE AND THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY ON THE MATTER. IF I'VE NAY PERHAPS WE COULD. SHARE THIS QUICKLY. I AM NEW TO THIS POSITION I UNDERSTAND OUR ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN HERE FOR A LONG TIME I HAVE BEEN HERE FOR FIVE MONTHS. AS I HAVE EXPRESSED TO THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL WE DON'T NEED TO BE FORCED TO THE TABLE ON THIS DISCUSSION THERE'S NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT. EVERYONE NOT ONLY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE UNITED STATES TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY THERE ARE WAYS TO ADDRESS AFFORDABILITY I WAS PLEASED TO BE PART OF THAT EFFORT IN MARYLAND. BY THE WAY MARYLAND LET RATE SETTING GO FIVE YEARS AGO NOW. ONTO NEW THINGS WE SHOULD BE AT THAT LEADING EDGE OF POLICY DEVELOPMENT HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE SHOULD BE ADDRESSING AFFORDABILITY I AM PLEASED NOT ONLY TO PLAY A ROLE IN TERMS OF OUR ASSOCIATION. BUT TO PLAY A LEADING ROLE IN THAT CONVERSATION. I THINK YOU'RE JUST LIKE I SAID JUST ONE. ONE PER PERSON SO BOB MISS. MISTER BONTA AND THEN MISS CARILLO POPPED OUT BUT AFTER IT BURKE MISSED CREEL NOT BACK THEN MISS LAMONT SO PLEASE AND WE'LL TRY TO KEEP. IT OFF OPEN THIS WILL BE SHORT MA'AM THANK YOU MISTER KALRA UP FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND. THANK YOU TO ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS ON ON BOTH SIDES FOR FOR THIS DISCUSSION I THINK WE'VE. EMBARK ON A REALLY IMPORTANT DISCUSSION AND AND AND AND THAT'S SORT OF MY OF MY FIRST POINT I THINK IS PERHAPS ONE OF MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES YOU CAN DISCUSS WE CAN BE DISCUSSING AND HEALTH CARE THE UNSUSTAINABLE RISING COST OF HEALTHCARE WE'VE HAD. JOINT COMMITTEE HEARINGS ON IT IT COMES UP AND ANIMATES ALMOST EVERY DISCUSSION IN HEALTH CARE ANYWHERE YOU TALK ABOUT IT SO. I I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT WILLINGNESS TO TAKE THIS ISSUE. HEAD ON I THINK PROBABLY IN THIS ROOM THERE IS WIDE AGREEMENT ON WHAT THE PROBLEM IS I DON'T THINK ANYONE WILL DENY THAT RISING COSTS ARE PROBLEM. I THINK FOR SURE THERE'S WIDE DISAGREEMENT AND I WHAT THE APPROPRIATE SOLUTION AS I AM I WILL SAY THAT. IF THIS WERE A PROBLEM THAT WERE EASY TO SOLVE AND WERE AMENABLE TO THAT A QUICK AND EASY SOLUTION WOULD HAVE A BY NOW WE DON'T. BECAUSE IT'S HARD AND IT'S TRICKY AND IT'S DIFFICULT SO I'M ALSO NOT SHOCKED THAT WE DON'T HAVE. AGREEMENT IN THE FIRST COMMITTEE THE FIRST HOUSE THAT WE HAVE THIS THINGS WRAPPED UP IN A BOW AND AND AND AND READY TO GO. SO M.. I APPRECIATE YOU DESIRE TO TAKE THIS ON. I HAVE REAL CONCERNS THAT A SIGNIFICANT ABOUT THIS BILL I SHARE THEM WITH YOU WHEN AND AND OTHERS IN THIS ROOM. LOT OF THEM HAVE BEEN NAMED ALREADY TODAY I JUST KIND OF GO THROUGH IT REAL QUICKLY I I YOU KNOW WE. AS AS DEMOCRATS AS AS AS HUMANS CARE DEEPLY ABOUT ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY HEALTHCARE THAT THAT REALLY DRIVES OUR COMMITMENT TO THE HEALTH CARE. I WONDER IF IT'S GONNA BE UNDERMINED AS AS AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF POINTS OF THIS BILL. AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT REWARDING IN RECOGNIZING THOSE THAT TAKE ON MORE MEDI CAL. I ALSO HEAR REGULARLY FROM PROVIDERS WERE TALKING ABOUT THEIR OWN PRACTICE THAT. YOU KNOW THAT MIX OF THE COMMERCIAL PAYER THAT THAT AND MEDICARE PAYERS AND MEDICAL PAIRS COMBINED HELP THEM. HAVE A HAVE A BUSINESS THAT'S SUSTAINABLE ON THAT THE COMMERCIAL RATES SUBSIDIZE ESSENTIALLY THE MEDICARE RIGHT I THINK A MEDIC COUNTIES HAVE TO GET HIGHER THEY JUST DO. SO I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOU THINK THIS IS THE ONLY SOLUTION I AM I THINK WE CAN STILL PURSUE SOME OF THE OTHER SOLUTIONS THAT WE HAVE TO BIG BILLS THE LOT OF US SUPPORTED TO RAISE MEDICARE RATES LIKE THAT SHOULD BE PUT BY THE WAYSIDE. AS BEEF CONTINUE TO EXPLORE THIS ISSUE OF IF THAT'S WHAT THE THE WILL THIS BODY HAS. A WAY ABOUT THE PROVIDER SHORTAGE WE'VE WE'VE THAT IN AND WHETHER THIS WILL EXACERBATE IT. IF THIS IS THE ONLY STATE THAT HAS A. AT COMMISSION THAT SETTING RATES AND OTHER STATE DOES. AND IT'S ALREADY HARD TO TO TO TO LIVE HERE AND WORK HERE AS A PROVIDER BECAUSE OF OF STUDENT DAD AND AND. WHAT WE NEED TO DO MORE ON A GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION THE WHAT WILL THAT DO THAT'S BEEN REYES I AND I I I KNOW YOU'VE ADDRESSED IT TO TO SOME EXTENT BUT I STILL THINK THAT'S A CONCERN THAT WE HAVE TO? GET OUR ARMS AROUND. YOU KNOW THIS BILL TAKES ON. SOME COST DRIVERS BUT NOT ALL. WE NEED TO HAVE A GLOBAL A UNIVERSAL THAT APPROACH AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVE LIMITS WE HAVE RISA THAT WE HAVE THE COMMERCE CLUB HAS. YOU KNOW I GET THE FEDERAL INTERPLAY WITH STATE LAW WE CAN'T DO IT ALL. BUT I THINK WE NEED TO TRY OUT TO THE EXTENT WE CAN ADDRESS ALL COST DRIVERS. AT A HIGH PRICE SPECIALTY DRUGS ARE A COST DRIVER. I. T. SEISMIC. EQUIPMENT. GENERAL WASTE INEFFICIENCY IS INEFFICIENCY ARE COST RIDERS YOU KNOW. MAYBE  <u><c.green>WILL LEAVE THAT. IT</c></u> COMMERCIAL RATES ACCOMPA SOME OF THOSE ARE ALL OF THOSE ME MAYBE YOU DON'T BUT I THINK THOSE ARE THOSE ARE REAL. AND THEN FINALLY YOU KNOW THIS ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED BY MY MISS BURKE. AND AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT I. DEEPLY BELIEVE AND IS IS IS HOW WE GET THERE IS IMPORTANT. BUT THE PROCESS. THIS IMPACTS ALL OF US. PROVIDER COMMUNITY FOR SURE THAT. AND I THINK ALL VOICES NEED TO BE IN THE ROOM AT ALL WHILE I'M. SEEKING TO BE TAKEN OFF THE TABLE AS WE DISCUSS THIS I I KNOW YOU HAVE A WILLINGNESS TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. AYE AYE I ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT WILLINGNESS ENCOURAGE THOSE WHO HAVEN'T HAD THEIR VOICES IN THE ROOM TO TO GO TO THAT ROOM. AND EXPRESS THEM TO PUT THE BEST IDEAS ON THE TABLE AND HAVE THEM COMPETE AND IN IN THE. YOU KNOW IT IN THE INTELLECTUAL DEBATE OVER IDEA TO SEE WHICH ONES PREVAIL AND ANTI TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THIS NEED WILL FIND. AS I'VE AS I'VE SEEN THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND OTHER TIMES THAT THERE'S. SOME OPPORTUNITIES TO ITS OF TO FIND COMMON GROUND YOU CAN'T GET THERE IF YOU DON'T SEEK IT. AND SO I JUST WANNA COURAGE YOU TO SORT OF DO WHAT YOU CAN TO CULTIVATE A PROCESS FOR ALL STAKEHOLDERS AT THE TABLE SO. I'LL JUST SAY I DON'T THINK WITH BILLS READY TODAY. BUT I DON'T THINK IT HAS TO BE READY TODAY AND IN THE FIRST HOUSE IN THE IN IN THE I AM THE FIRST COMMITTEE. I AM. I WILL BE LOOKING AT A VERY CLOSELY AS A PROCEEDS TO SEE HOW YOU ADDRESS THESE MAJOR CONCERNS THAT I AND OTHERS HAVE RAISED. AND I RESERVE MY RIGHT TO A VOTE DIFFERENTLY IN THE FUTURE BUT TODAY I'M GONNA VOTE AYE AND APPRECIATE TAKING ON THIS VERY TOUGH ISSUE. I KNOW IT'S NOT EASY AND I URGE ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO HOT TO TRY TO FIND COMMON GROUND TO GET TO SOLUTION THAT CAN WORK THANK YOU. CARILLO. YES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. WHO THINK IT TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS TO OUR ATTENTION I WOULD SAY THAT? ALL GREAT SOCIETIES ARE DEFINED BY THE COURAGE OF OUR CONVICTIONS TO BE BOLD AND COURAGEOUS IN ADDRESSING ISSUES THAT ARE. HARD. TO DO HARD CONVERSATIONS TO HAVE. I MET WITH YOURSELF WHEN SUPPORTERS WITH OPPOSITION. WANTED TO HEAR ALL PERSPECTIVES. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I TOOK AWAY FROM WAS A YOUNG MAN WHO IS A DOCTOR WHO IS STUDYING TO BECOME A DOCTOR ACTUALLY ON HIS LAST YEAR OF RESIDENCY WHO SAID HE'S GOING TO BE GRADUATING WITH TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN DEBT. AND THAT YOU KNOW IS IS A REAL ISSUE ACROSS THE BOARD NOT ONLY FOR STATE BUT FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. AND TO THINK ABOUT HIM BECOMING A DOCTOR AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE TO PRACTICE YOU DON'T GO INTO THE FIELD OF MEDICINE OR IN THE FIELD OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. OR ANY OTHER FIELD BECAUSE YOU'RE IN A FOR YOURSELF YOU DO IT BECAUSE YOU WANT HELP PEOPLE. AND I THINK THAT WE'RE IN A SITUATION RIGHT NOW WHERE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE COST OF HEALTH CARE. IS NOT AFFORDABLE EVEN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS NOT AFFORDABLE AS GOOD AS IT IS. MANY PEOPLE JUST CAN'T BEFORE TO BE HONEST THE TO YOUR POINT VERY EARLY ON. IN THE DISCUSSION ABOUT RATIONING OF HEALTHCARE. THAT IS A VERY REAL THING. I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO HAVE A BROADER LARGER CONVERSATION ASIDE FROM THIS COMMITTEE WHICH IS CLEARLY NOT ENOUGH TIME WITH ALL THE MANY QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS AND COMMENTS THAT. MEMBERS HAVE BEEN AND I'M SURE THE PUBLIC HAS AS WELL AND STAKEHOLDERS HAVE. TO COME TO A FINAL CONCLUSION AS TO WHAT THIS IS WHAT I DO APPRECIATE. OF IT. IS THAT IT SETS THE TONE FOR WHAT THE COMMISSION COULD POTENTIALLY BE LIKE. AND THAT IF WE CAN HAVE THIS CONVERSATION HERE. ELEVEN PEOPLE WHILE IT MAY SEEM A SMALL NUMBER IS CERTAINLY MORE THAN WHAT WE HAVE NOW WHICH IS NONE. AND SO TO EVEN COME TO THE TABLE WITH DIFFERENT VIEWPOINTS DIFFERENT IDEAS DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS WHICH IS WHAT WE ALL WANT TO HEAR I MEAN WE CAN HEAR ABOUT ALL THE PROBLEMS ALL DAY LONG. BUT WE WANT TO COME TO A CONCLUSION AS TO WHAT WE DO TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE. NOT ONLY HAVE AXIS BUT CAN USE. THE HEALTH CARE SO THAT THEY'RE NOT LANDING IN EMERGENCY ROOMS SO THAT THEY'RE NOT WITHOUT CARE. SO THAT IT IS AFFORDABLE AND THE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO PRACTICE MEDICINE OUR STATE CANNOT. AND SO I COMMEND THE HOSPITALS FOR BEING AT THE FOREFRONT. OF THAT CONVERSATION FOR PROVIDING CARE AS WELL AS THE SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL ISN'T. AND IN INTRODUCING IDEAS AND THE THOUGHT PROCESS US TO WHAT WE CAN DO TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE THAT CALLS CALIFORNIA HOME CAN HAVE ACCESS TO QUALITY HEALTHCARE. I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE ALL WANT TO GET OUT I MEAN WE'VE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MEDICARE AND IDEA THAT. SOME OPPOSED EVEN THE BEGINNING OF THAT SEVERAL DECADES AGO AND NOW HAS PROVIDED. COVERAGE TO MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE NEVER EASY. AND CLEARLY WE'RE NOT GOING TO COME TO A SOLUTION RIGHT NOW. BUT I HOPE THAT ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS WHETHER THEY'VE BEEN A PART OF THE CONVERSATION BEFORE. OR WHETHER. THEY'RE INCLINED TO DO SO NOW CAN HELP THAT AND AGAIN LIKE I WANT TO BE PART OF THE DIALOGUE BECAUSE I BELIEVE. THAT WE CAN COME TO A SOLUTION I DON'T BELIEVE ANYBODY AT THE TABLE-RIGHT NOW. IS SAYING WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE A SOLUTION. THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE GET THERE. SO I COMMEND YOU FOR BRINGING THIS TO TO. THIS COMMITTEE IT'S NOT EASY TO BE IN MANY WAYS A FIRING SQUAD. WITHIN A ALL OF OUR QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS. AND IN DOING SO IN A WAY THAT BRINGS DIGNITY TO THE ISSUE. AND TO THE PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SERVE. AND SO I WILL BE VOTING YES ON YOUR ON YOUR BILL. AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE THE REST OF THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER VOTING YES AS WELL SO THAT WE CAN BEGIN THE CONVERSATION. AND BRING EVERYONE THAT HAS AN OPINION A THOUGHT PROCESS AND HOW WE CAN ENSURE ACCESS TO QUALITY HEALTHCARE TO EVERY CALIFORNIA AND THAT INCLUDES WHETHER YOU OPPOSE OR SUPPORT OR IN BETWEEN. TO MAKE SURE THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY WERE DOING WHAT WE CAN. TWO. TRY TO SOLVE A PROBLEM THAT IS NOT GONNA BE SOLVED OVERNIGHT BUT THAT REQUIRES THAT WE. BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT IT AND BEGIN TO HAVE SOME ACTION ON IT. MORE THAN JUST THE OUTSIDE CONVERSATION SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK AND THANK YOU TO BOTH SIDES. FOR BRINGING ALL OF YOUR DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE TO THE TABLE BECAUSE ARE IMPORTANT. AND CERTAINLY CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE NEED. SO MISS LIMON WE HAVE FIVE MEMBERS WAITING TO SPEAK SO IRATE SO I WILL BUILD UP WITH WALDRON A THINK A LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SHARED SOME OF THE CONCERNS I'M GONNA TRY TO LIMIT IT TO ONE QUESTION FOR EACH SIDE. UP FOR THE SUPPORTERS MY FIRST QUESTION IS. WHAT IF THIS DOESN'T WORK WHAT HAPPENS THEN? WE DEFAULT TO THE CURRENT SYSTEM WHICH IS ALSO NOT WORKING. AND IS DRIVEN BY. PURE MARKET CONSIDERATIONS AND MONOPOLISTIC TAKEOVERS OF OUR HEALTH CARE I MEAN THIS THE CURRENT. REALITY IS. SUPER NOT GREAT AND I THINK THAT WE DO HAVE MODELS THAT. WE CAN DRAW FROM THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM AND APPLY. AND REALLY CALIFORNIA HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEAVE HERE SO. IT IT IS YOU KNOW WE'RE TAKING ON SOMETHING THAT IS CHALLENGING WERE TAKING ON SOMETHING THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES FACING OUR STATE TODAY. AND. YOU KNOW OVER TIME WE WILL GET TO REALIZE. YOU DON'T MAKE ADJUSTMENTS IF WE'RE NOT. OVERLY PRESCRIPTIVE AND I THINK THAT IS THE BIG TAKEAWAY FROM MARYLAND IS WE NEED TO. ALLOW FOR ADJUSTMENTS TO BE MADE OVER TIME ONE MORE THING ALL SAY ON THAT. THERE IS A TON OF EXPERIMENTATION THAT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME AND HEALTHCARE POLICY. PAYMENT REFORM IS ONE BIG EXPERIMENT IN ONE BIG IDEA. THE IDEA OF VALUE VERSUS VOLUME THAT YOU CAN PULL THE MONETARY LEVERS AND MAKE OUTCOMES BE DIFFERENT BASED ON THAT. THAT IS BEING DRIVEN BY BOTH THE PUBLIC SECTOR AS WELL AS THE PRIVATE SECTOR THEY'RE EASY TON OF EXPERIMENTATION THAT'S HAPPENING. AND GUESS WHAT. IN THAT PROCESS. THEIR HAVE BEEN NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES. AND WE KEEP GOING BECAUSE TRYING FOR BETTER IS IMPORTANT. BUT THAT IS THE TRUTH ABOUT OUR CURRENT REALITY. AND THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU'RE USING IS THAT MARILYN OR WHAT EVIDENCE ARE YOU USING. THAT THIS HAS A CHANCE OF WORKING. YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT DATA BUT DATA IS NOT EVIDENCE WHAT'S THE EVIDENCE YOU'RE USING THAT THIS IS GOING TO HELP GET YOU THERE. WELL IT'S THE THE GRAND EXPERIMENT WITH MEDICARE IT'S THE GRAND EXPERIMENT WITH MARYLAND IT IS THE GRAND EXPERIMENT IN MASSACHUSETTS. YOU KNOW THE COUNTRIES OF FRANCE GERMANY THE NETHERLANDS HAVE ALL USE OUR MEDICARE PAYMENT SYSTEM TO MODEL THEIR OWN. IN FACT I WILL SAY BECAUSE IT HASN'T BEEN SAID TO ME THAT WHEN THEY THAT SELECT COMMITTEE LOOKED AT WHAT IS EVERYBODY ELSE DOING THAT WE'RE NOT DOING THAT'S MAKING THEIR SYSTEMS BOTH CHEAPER AND HIGHER QUALITY. HAVE. COSTS ARE LOWER BUT THEY'RE GETTING BETTER OUTCOMES FROM THEIR SYSTEMS THE ONE THING THEY ALL HAD IN COMMON WAS THAT THEY REGULATED. PRICES. AND SO THAT THAT IS ESSENTIALLY THE STARTING POINT FOR THIS CONVERSATION THE ONE THING THAT ALL INDUSTRIALIZED WEALTHY NATIONS TO IN THEIR HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS IS THEY REGULATE PRICES. IN HEALTHCARE. SO I GUESS FOR ME IS A LISTEN TO THIS THE CONCERN I HAVE IS THAT. YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THAT EXPERIMENTATION IS NEEDED BY ALSO. YOU KNOW THE ANSWER THAT WELL WE'LL JUST FAILED LIKE THE SYSTEM IS FAILING NOW IS REALLY HARD. IT IT'S JUST A HARD ANSWER TO KIND OF GRAPPLE WITH BECAUSE IF THE SYSTEM FAILS. OUR COMMUNITY FEELS WITH IT. SO YOU KNOW THIS ARE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE'RE ASKING OURSELVES NUMBER ONLY ASKING OURSELVES THESE QUESTIONS BECAUSE WE CARE AND BECAUSE WERE INVESTED IN TRYING TO SEE WHAT THE SOLUTION WOULD BE. AT FOUR IN THE OPPOSITION YOU TALKED ABOUT AND WANTING TO BE AT THE TABLE TO ADDRESS HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW TO ADDRESS HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY. AND WHAT HAVE YOU PUT ON THE TABLE. WE HAVE BEEN AT THE TABLE ALL ALONG TRYING TO FIND SOME ANSWERS IT IS AS WE'VE HEARD OTHERS IN THE NATION SAY COMPLEX. WHAT PART OF CMA RIGHT NOW IS PART OF THE CARE FOR ALL CALIFORNIA COALITION THAT HAS PUT FORWARD OTHER IDEAS ON HOW TO DEAL WITH THE COST? WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE SUPPORTING THAT COALITION AND SOME OF THE SOME OF THE BILLS THAT ARE BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE NOW. I WILL TELL YOU FROM CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION STANDPOINT WE HAVE AN ANNUAL SESSION. THIS IS BEEN AN ONGOING DISCUSSION AT THE ANNUAL SESSION OF OUR HOUSE OF DELEGATES REPRESENTING PHYSICIANS IN ALMOST A PRACTICE ALL OVER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS NOW WE'RE GETTING OUR AGENDA FOR NEXT YEAR WHY NOT NEXT YEAR THIS COMING OCTOBER. AND WELL WE USUALLY TACKLE FOR FIVE MAJOR ISSUES AT THAT MEETING. THE RECOMMENDATION FROM OUR GROUP THAT PUTS TOGETHER THAT AGENDA AND IS NOW GOING TO OUR BOARD. IS AN ALL SESSION ON COST CONTAINMENT COST IN AFFORDABLE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. WE'RE NOT BLIND TO IT WE ACCEPT THE CHALLENGE WE WANT TO BE PART OF THAT SOLUTION TO THE ISSUE. AND WE CONTINUE TO BE THERE WHAT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT OUR DRACONIAN BACKWARD LOOKING WAYS OF TRYING TO FIX THE SYSTEM. AND I APPRECIATE THAT THERE'S A CONVERSATION HAPPENING BUT I ALSO THINK THAT THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING MORE CONCRETE PUTS A TABLE WE'VE HAD A YEARS OF KNOWING THAT OUR SYSTEM THAT NEEDED FIXING. I'M AND I SPENT YOU KNOW MORE THAN TWO HOURS ACTUALLY WITH LOCAL CMA REPRESENTATIVES TALKING ABOUT THIS. AND WHAT CAME OUT AFTER A TWO HOUR CONVERSATION IS THEIR REGRET THAT THEY HAVEN'T BROUGHT A CONCRETE SOLUTION TO THE TABLE. AND THAT'S A PROBLEM AND SO I THINK A LESSON FOR EVERYBODY OUT THERE IS UNLESS WE'RE BRINGING SOLUTIONS TO THE TABLE. THIS IS GOING TO KEEP HAPPENING UP AYE ICY THIS BILL AS A CONVERSATION AND THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN I'VE SAID IF THERE'S NOT A BILL THERE'S NOT A CONVERSATION. UGH BUT I HAVE GREAT CONCERNS I HAVE GREAT CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL BECAUSE. YET WHAT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT IS URBAN AND RURAL WELL AS THE SIXTH LARGEST ECONOMY THERE'S A WHOLE LOT IN BETWEEN. AND IN A COMMUNITY THAT HAS A HIGH COST OF LIVING WHERE I MYSELF CAN ONLY GO SEE A PROVIDER ON A FRIDAY OR SATURDAY. AND THAT ALONE IS REALLY DIFFICULT TO FIND. I I I THINK BACK TO THIS IDEA WILL THIS IS GREAT. IF YOU. IF YOU END UP AYE CAPPING RATES. THAT'S GONNA HELP FOLKS BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF THE RATES ARE CAPPED AND I CAN'T FIND A HOSPITAL OR DOCTOR IT DOES ME AND MY COMMUNITY NO GOOD. TO CAP RATES IF THERE'S NOT A DOCTOR TO SEE AND HOSPITAL TO GO TO AND I THINK THAT THIS IS PART OF THE GREATER CONVERSATION. AND THIS IS PART OF THE CONCERN UP THAT I HAVE. I AM GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY I HAVE A LOT OF RESERVATIONS ABOUT THIS BECAUSE AS BEEN SAID THERE'S A LOT AT TO CONSIDER AND I DON'T WANT A REPEAT A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK. COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID. BUT I WANT US TO THINK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IN SOME COMMUNITIES THAT IS REALLY. THE FEAR AND WERE NOT DRIVEN ON FEAR THAT FEAR IS REAL I TALKED TO HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY THAT STRUGGLE TO FIGURE OUT WHERE TO GO PEOPLE SAY WILL GO TO A KAISER GUESS WHAT I DON'T HAVE BEEN WHERE YOU LIVE. AND SO I THINK THAT THAT'S. SOMETHING DATA I WILL BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION AND AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD I WILL CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO SUPPORT IT. BUT I DEFINITELY AT I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S REASON TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AND I HOPE THAT WE WILL SEE A DIFFERENT EFFORT AN EFFORT. THAT REALLY STARTS TO MAKE COMPROMISES AROUND WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN TO MOVE THIS FORWARD. GUIDE AND UP WE HAVE FIVE FOUR FOUR MEMBERS PLUS ME WOULD LIKE TO SPEAKS UP WE COULD. MOVING HERE WE'VE GOT WE ALSO HAVE UP. THIRTY OTHER BILLS. TODAY. WE'VE ONLY PROOF WE'VE ONLY VOTED ON ONE BILL. SO JUST JUST JUST SAY HAVE. PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OKAY. I'LL TRY THOSE FRANCESTHE CAN HEAR CHRISTMAS SO MANY THOUGHTS OF JUST ERASED HALF MY QUESTIONS SLOW. OKAY SO THE PURPOSE THE RESERVES RIGHT IN THE BILL. YOU KNOW. SECTION ONE HUNDRED SIX OH THREE IT TALKS ABOUT. SETTING THE AMOUNTS ACCEPTED. PAYMENT. DETERMINE METHODS FOR STATE GOVERNMENT TO REDUCE THE COSTS OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND MEDICAL DEVICES PAID FOR BY PRIVATE PURCHASERS. CONTROL IN STATE CARE COST IN A MANNER INTENDED TO IMPROVE HEALTH CARE QUALITY. IMPROVE OUTCOMES AND REDUCE HEALTH DISPARITIES FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS SO ANNA TALK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT. WAS TOUCHED UPON BUT NOT REALLY TALKED ABOUT THAT'S PATIENTS. IN ONE OF MY BIGGEST DRIVERS BEING ON HEALTH COMMITTEE HAS ALWAYS BEEN PATIENTS PATIENT CARE. PATIENT ACCESS SO. IF THIS COMMISSION WILL FORMED AN IN THEM AND PICK SOMETHING UP RIGHT OUT. RARE DISEASE PATIENTS. FACE CHRONIC LIFE THREATENING DISEASES ON SOME OF THE COUNTRY'S HIGHEST TREATMENT COST. DISEASES. SUCH AS THOSE COVERED UNDER THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S SERVICES CCS PROGRAM. AND LATER THE GENETICALLY HANDICAPPED PERSONS PROGRAM G. HPP. REQUIRE ACCESS TO SPECIALIZED EXPENSIVE CARE AND THERAPIES FOR LIFE. SO YOU KNOW TAKE HEMOPHILIA THE AVERAGE COST OF IN THE DOLE. IN FOR YEARS THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. HOW WOULD THIS ISSUE BE ADDRESSED BY THE COMMITTEE? WHO'S LOOKING TO REDUCE COSTS. OF CARE. AND I GUESS WHAT I'M ASKING FOR IS A COMMITMENT THAT. THESE PATIENTS WILL BE FUNDED. SO I'M SORRY. MISS WALDRON. THAT MANY OF THE PROGRAMS THAT YOU MENTIONED ARE PUBLIC PROGRAMS M. CCS FOR EXAMPLE IS A MEDI CAL PROGRAM. WHOSE REACH GOES FAR BEYOND THE MEDI CAL ELIGIBLE POPULATIONS IF YOU HAVE A VERY SICK CHILD WHOSE HEALTH CARE EXPENSES WOULD EXCEED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF THE FAMILY'S INCOME. THAT FAMILY CAN QUALIFY FOR CCS EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT MEDI CAL ELIGIBLE WE HAVE MEDICARE WHICH ALSO SERVES PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. AND SO MANY OF OF THE HIGH NEEDS POPULATIONS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE ALREADY COVERED. UNDER PUBLIC PROGRAMS. THIS BILL IS SPECIFICALLY DIRECTED TO LOOK AT THE COMMERCIAL MARKET TO THE EXTENT THAT WE DO HAVE INDIVIDUALS WITH. VERY S. SIGNIFICANT HEALTH CARE MEDICARE PAYMENT SYSTEM IS ALREADY. PERFECTLY SORT OF SET UP TO DEAL WITH THOSE I'M REIMBURSEMENTS BECAUSE THEY DO COVER I'M VERY SICK POPULATIONS ALREADY. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH RARE DISEASE AND GENETIC INVOLVED DISEASE IS THAT. IT CAN TAKE UP TO EIGHT YEARS BEFORE PEOPLE EVEN DIAGNOSED. AND AT THAT POINT THERE PROBABLY COULD BE IN A COMMERCIAL PLAN. NOT IN THE MEDICARE PLAN. SO YOU HAVE PROVIDERS THAT ARE DOING TESTING THIS GENETIC TESTING ALL THOSE THINGS I I JUST BRINGING THIS OUT OF THE RECORD BECAUSE. IT'S AN ISSUE THAT COULD FALL BY THE WAYSIDE. YOU KNOW WHICH WAS A DISCUSSION WE HAD IN OUR UNIVERSAL SINGLE PAYER COMMITTEES TO THAT. NO THERE'S SOME UNIQUE CASES THAT WE WANT TO BE SURE THOSE PATIENTS STILL HAVE CARE. THANK YOU FOR SPEAKING OUT ON BEHALF OF THOSE PATIENTS WITH THOSE UNIQUE SITUATIONS AND CERTAINLY THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WILL BE COUNTY FOUR AS INDICATED ME THOSE PROGRAMS ALREADY PUBLIC PROGRAMS FUNDED BY MEDICARE. BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE SITUATIONS THAT'S NOT THE CASE ABSOLUTELY THAT THOSE WOULD BE PEOPLE THAT WILL BE OUT OF THE CONVERSATION AS TO. HOW WE SET UP BY THE ENSURE QUALITY OUTCOMES OCCUR? ON IT IN A SMALL MARKET REFERRAL SPAWNED A IS SO MY COMMENTS WERE COMPARING CALIFORNIA TO DIFFERENT EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. YOU KNOW OUR CONCERN HERE IS NOT OR DOCTORS GOING TO CANADA TO OUR DOCTORS GOING TO OREGON SO FOR THOSE PROGRAMS IT WOULD BE. NOT THAT THEY'RE NOT FUNDED BY BETTER CAL BUT THERE'S JUST NO SPECIALIST ACTUALLY PROVIDE THE SERVICE. AND SO THAT WE ARE CONCERNED THERE. OKAY. YEAH I WANT I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT MEDICAL NECESSITY HOPE THAT THE COMMITTEE THE COMMISSION WITH THE FIND THAT. SO REGARDING FOREIGN MILITARIES. AND WE KNOW THAT'S ALWAYS AN ISSUE THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN AN ISSUE FOR ME TRYING TO GET PATIENTS ACCESS. THE. TREATMENT THAT THE PHYSICIAN WANTS. THE PATIENT I HAVE. WILL ACCEPTING TREATMENTS REMAIN UNCHANGED TO WORSEN UNDER THIS COMMISSION. THE HOPE THAT IT THAT THE THE GREATER ACCESS MEANING YOU CRANK THAT'S THE OF THE HOPE OF THE COMMISSION WERE CERTAINLY NOT LOOKING TO CHANGE ACCESS. OR REDUCE THE ABILITY FOR DOCTORS OR HOSPITALS BUILT RETREAT PATIENTS. INSULT THE IT COULD INCREASE ACCESS BY BOB IN IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES WHERE THERE MAY NOT BE ACCESS RIGHT NOW IF YOU HAVE THE ABILITY FOR A DOCTOR TO BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THEMSELVES. UP BECAUSE THEY COULD GET HIGHER COMMERCIAL RACING THEY CURRENTLY GET THAN YOU COULD ACTUALLY INCREASE ACCESS BUT ABSOLUTELY NOT NOT INTENDING ON REDUCING ACCESS AT ALL IN ANY WAY. SO THE FORMULA AREAS THAN WITH THOUGHT BECAUSE. THE FORMALLY ORDERS AS THEY STAND NOW WITH. REMAIN NO CHANGES TO CLINICAL PRACTICE WOULD BE MADE UNDER THE SPELL. OKAY BECAUSE PART OF THEIR. DRIVING IS TO LOOK AT REDUCING THE COST OF DRUGS AND MEDICAL DEVICES. AND. CONTROL HER IN STATE HEALTH CARE COSTS OF ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT CAME OUT IN THE SINGLE PAYER COMMITTEE WAS. FORMULARIES AND DRUGS AND TRYING TO MATCH THEM UP TO. YOU KNOW THE THE VETERANS AFFAIRS AND THEN. THEREFORE MILLER SO I'M JUST CONCERNED BECAUSE I WANT TO INCREASE THE FOR MILLER ACCESS NOT RESTRICTED FURTHER. OKAY. SO THE BILL ADDRESSES HEALTH PLAN PREMIUMS. ALL THE DIFFERENT PLANS A DIFFERENT THOUGH THAN DESIGNED DIFFERENTLY. I'M. HOW DOES THE BILL DO ANYTHING TO? PREVENT THE CALLS FROM FROM SIMPLY BEING PASSED THOUGHT THAT THOUGH COST OF THE PREMIUMS COPAYS BECAUSE NOW THEY. PREMIUMS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE REDUCED BUT SOMEWHERE THAT COSTS US A GOES LIKE SQUEEZING A TO. TOOTH PASTE STIR IT GOES ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER THE COSTS ARE NOT GOING TO GO AWAY. SO. WHAT'S GOING TO PREVENT THAT FROM BEING PUSHED ONTO HIGHER DEDUCTIBLES OR CO PAYS. THROUGH THE CHAIR BY MAY AND MISS WALDRON TO GREAT QUESTION AND. ALL OF THE STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS RELATING TO UP CAPPING AND PREVENT AND AND WENT MANAGING OUT OF POCKET COSTS ARE STILL IN PLACE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT HAS LIMITS. ON WHAT INDIVIDUALS CAN PAY OUT OF POCKET AND YEARLY THERE ARE LIMITS ON DEDUCTIBLES THAT CURRENTLY AT SEVEN THOUSAND ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND FOR AN INDIVIDUAL. ALL OF THAT IS IN PLACE THERE'S ALSO LIMITS ON. PREVENTING HEALTH PLANS FROM BEING ABLE TO HAVE A LIMIT ON HOW MUCH CARE THEY PAY FOR ANNUALLY OR OVER A LIFETIME SO THAT YOU SEE GOT RID OF LIFETIME LIMITS. IN THEIR STATE PROTECTIONS IN TERMS OF NETWORK OUT TO SEA ADEQUACY TIMELY. AND ACCESS TO CARE AND LANGUAGE PROTECTIONS ALL THE PROTECTIONS AROUND. TAPPING OUT OF POCKET COSTS ARE THEY ALL STAY IN PLACE UNDER THIS LAW. SO WHERE WITH THE COSTS AGO WOMEN HOW THAT THE COVERS. THE IDEA IS THAT OF THIS BILL IS TO REALLY GET AT PRICES. UTILIZATION HAS GONE DOWN IN THIS COUNTRY AND PRICES HAVE SKYROCKETED. AND SO THE IDEA IS TO GUIDE OF GET A HANDLE ON THE PRICES THAT ARE CHARGED. BECAUSE THAT'S AND WE'VE SEEN WE DID S. B. FIVE WAS SPONSORED S. B. FIVE FORTY SIX. COUPLE YEARS AGO WHICH BROUGHT TRANSPARENCY TO THE WAY HEALTH PLAN SET PREMIUMS AND FOR THE LARGE GROUP. AND WE HAVE NOW TWO YEARS OF ROBUST DATA THERE'S BEEN TWO PUBLIC MEETINGS. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY SHOWED IS THAT A BIG DRIVER ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ARE REALLY DRIVING INCREASES IN PREMIUMS AND WHAT CONSUMERS ARE SPENDING OUT OF POCKET. IS DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS. PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IS A PIECE OF GUIDANCE ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING. PARTS DRIVER COST DRIVERS IN OUR SYSTEM BUT DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS ARE THE BIGGEST CHUNK OF WHAT WE ARE SPENDING OUR PREMIUM DOLLARS ON. JUST BRIEFLY DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS ARE THE MAIN PART OF ANY MEDICAL SERVICE SO THAT ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE. OKAY A I THINK WE WE WANT CEMEX VERY QUICKLY. OKAY SO AS FAR AS. HOW MANY HOSPITALS ARE IN MARYLAND? FORTY HOSPITALS IN THE STATE OF MARYLAND. SO FORTY AND THEY WERE ABLE TO. LOOK AT THOSE ON THE COMMITTEE THEY HAD AT THE TIME THEY HAD RATES SETTINGS BUT. I WAS JUST DOING SIMPLE MATH IF YOU SUBTRACT. CHRISTMAS WEEK AND. NEW YEAR'S WEEK THAT'S FIFTY WEEKS IN THE YEAR FOUR HUNDRED HOSPITALS THAT'S EIGHT WEEKS THIS COMMITTEE WOULD HAVE TO BE WORKED ON NOT EVEN TO MENTION THE HUNDRED THOUSAND. OR SO PROVIDERS. WITH ACTUAR EARLY ACTUARIAL IS A RETURN ON INVESTMENT ALL OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE TO LOOK AT. WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A HUGE STAFF. LET'S JUST. COMMENTS. IF I MAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND IN THE STATE OF MARYLAND REMEMBER THE RATE SETTING SYSTEM WAS ALL ABOUT LOOKING AT THE RATE OF INCREASE. IT DID NOT LOOK AT WHAT THIS BILL IS PROPOSING IN THAT IS TO SET. INDIVIDUAL RATES AT SOME BASE FOR ALL PHYSICIANS AND DENTISTS AND HOSPITALS FORTY HOSPITALS ONLY AND WAS TO CONTROL THE RATE OF INCREASE OVER TIME. OKAY JUST VERY QUICKLY COMMENTS ON THEM. OKAY SO. SO PLAYERS YOU KNOW SEEM TO BE MOVING TO COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF TREATMENT AND SERVICES IN ORDER TO DECIDE. WHAT TO PAY FOR A MONTH NOT TO PAY FOR? BUT FOR PATIENTS WITH RARE DISEASES AND OTHER CHRONIC DISEASES YOU KNOW. ARE EXPENSIVE TO TREAT THE REAL CONCERN IS THAT. A NEW PAYER LIKE AN OLD PAIR OF CAPT BECAUSE FOCUSES ON COMPARATIVE COST EFFECTIVENESS RATHER THAN CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS. TREATMENTS AND SERVICES SO. PHILIP WE'RE GONNA BE LOSIN QUALITY OF CARE TO. MAKE UP FOR THAT ON THE OTHER END. IN IN OUR UNIVERSAL CARE. COMMITTEE WE LOOK AT OTHER COUNTRIES AND OTHER STATES AND WE'RE GOVERNMENT SET RATES AND REGULATED PRICES BUT ALL THE COSTS ROSE NO ONE WAS ABLE TO GET A HANDLE ON REDUCING COSTS BECAUSE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN SOMETHING WE ALL WOULD'VE REALLY. LOOK THAT CLOSER. IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY BUT. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE OTHER. HIGH INTENSITY CHRONIC DISEASES RARE DISEASES IN EXETER. YOU KNOW AND MY CONCERN FOR ACCESS FOR THE UNDER SERVED WITH THE QUALITY CARE NOT JUST THE BASE CARE HOW DO WE GET NEW INNOVATIONS. IN LIFE SCIENCE TO FOLKS IF EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE CAPPED. WHERE'S THE INCENTIVE FOR AN INVASION INNOVATION IN OUR STATE. PERSONALIZE MEDICINE IS SOMETHING WE'RE TRYING TO LOOK AT SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY IN THE LONG TERM REDUCE COSTS IF WE TREAT THE PATIENT THE RIGHT WAY. AND MISS BURKE AND I HAVE A BILL TALK UP BAKA GENETIC TESTING I MEAN IF WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH IT'S CHEAPER TO TREAT. BUT INSTEAD OF BRINGING THE META CHO UP WHICH A FEW OF US HAVE TALKED ABOUT WE NEED TO IMPROVE MEDI CAL. AND THE RATE. I FEEL THIS BILL IS BRINGING. A COMMERCIAL CARE NOW. SO THAT'S MY CLOSING STATEMENT. STERN MISSOURIAN FOLLOWED BY MR MCCARTY AND SO WILL KEEP MOVING ALONG HERE GUYS PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND MISTER CHAIR I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE AND YOUR. CALM TONE AND HOW WE'RE CARRYING ON THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MY PLEASURE MISTER THIS AREA. UP AT I I GOTTA MAKE AN OBSERVATION AND THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE COMMITTEE BUT. I REMEMBER SITTING IN THIS COMMITTEE ROOM FOR ABOUT FIVE OR SIX HOURS. WHEN MISTER BONTA WAS CHAIR. AND WE DISCUSSED THE VACCINATION BILL. A. I WISH WE GAVE THAT PERIOD OF A TIME TO THIS BILL THIS'S WHISPERED TALKING ABOUT CHANGING AND AGAIN THIS IS NO REFLECTION TO THE CHAIR OF COURSE THIS IS JUST. A COMMENTARY ON THE WAY WE PROCESS THINGS HERE. WITH THIRTY FOUR BILLS IN ONE NIGHT WHEN ONE OF THEM MAKES SUCH A. DRASTIC CHANGE IMPACT AND AND AND AND INDUSTRY. I THINK ONCE ITS OWN TIME. RATHER THAN BEING FOCUS THAT WITH A THIRTY THREE OTHERS. SO. COUPLE OF BASIC QUESTIONS AND THEN A THIRD QUESTION OF SOMETHING THAT I HAVEN'T REALLY HEARD BEING RAISED ABOUT. A AND MAYBE I'M WRONG ON THIS BUT FIRST OF ALL. EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLAR ISSUE WITH THE OF THE LOSS FROM HOSPITALS CAN YOU. PLEASE. OFFER SOME LEVEL OF DETAIL GIVEN. THE TIME CRUNCH WE HAVE OF WHERE DO YOU GET THAT I KEEP ON HEARING THAT BUT I HAVEN'T. WOULD BE HAPPY TWO AND IT'S VERY SIMPLE IF I MAY USE THIS CHART TO EXPLAIN. BASICALLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS TAKING THAT GRAYBAR PRIVATE INSURANCE THE EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IS THE IMPACT IF THE RATES WERE SET AT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. OF MEDICARE SO IT'S VERY THIS IS ALL STATE DATA IT'S VERY EASY FOR US TO MODEL. ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE MEDICARE RATES TODAY WOULD BRING IT TO THAT RED LINE SHOT SLIGHTLY ABOVE COST BECAUSE MEDICARE. PAYS TWENTY THREE PERCENT BELOW COST TODAY THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF MEDICARE IT'S BARELY BREAKING EVEN THAT'S THE EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS. IF THEY WERE SET AT MEDICARE RATES THE LOSSES WOULD BE FAR GREATER. IF THEY WERE SET AT HIGHER THAN A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF MEDICARE THE LOSSES WOULD BE LESS. BUT IT BEGS THE QUESTION WHETHER THERE IS ANY COST CONTAINMENT ANY PRICE SAVINGS. GET. I'D LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU. THAT OF MISTER COLOCAR KALRA BUT JUSTANSWER THEN THEN THAT GOES BACK TO THE ASSUMPTION OF THE. IN THE FIRST EXAMPLE YOU GAVE OF THE RESTAURANT WHERE YOU. WE PAY A BILL AND THEN YOU RECEIVE A BILL AND THEN YOU MAKE A PAYMENT THAT'S NOT HAVE TO SIGH HEFTY AMOUNT OF THE BILL. WELL. THAT ALL DUE RESPECT THAT EXAMPLE DOESN'T REALLY APPLY HERE BECAUSE. THAT. SUGGESTS THAT THE PLAYERS DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE WALKING INTO. THE REALITY IS THE WHOLE IDEA IS THAT THE. THE FACTORS INVOLVED IN THE COST OF WHAT THE RESTAURANT IS GONNA CHARGE IS ALREADY GONNA HAVE ASSUMED THE LOWER PRICES. SO YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR PAIN. THAT THAT THAT KIND OF THEN ERODES THE ARGUMENT ON THIS DOESN'T. MATTER YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. COSTS IF I MAY OFFER A ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE A TO THE QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED. BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER WALDRON. ON THE COST OF CARE WHETHER THAT'S FOR A VERY EXPENSIVE PEDIATRIC CASE. FOR AN INDIVIDUAL WITH CANCER. FOR SOMEONE NAME BUT YOU KNOW THOUSAND OTHER CONDITIONS THE ACTUAL COST OF THAT CARE DOESN'T CHANGE AT ALL. WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS SIMPLY SAY WE'RE GONNA DETERMINE HOW MUCH WE'RE GONNA PAY YOU FOR THAT SERVICE? SO THE DOCTORS AND THE NURSES AND THE SURGERY AND CHEMOTHERAPY AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT'S A PART OF THAT VISIT. IS STILL THERE THE DRUGS ARE STILL GOING UP A TEN POINT SIX PERCENT A YEAR. ALL OF THE CLUSTER THERE WERE SIMPLY SETTING HOW MUCH WOULD BE PAID FOR THAT VISIT THAT'S WHERE THE CHALLENGE AND THE LOSSES AND THE CONCERN ABOUT PHYSICIANS LEAVING THE STATE. AND HOSPITAL CLOSURES COMMIT. AND THE IDEA BEHIND THE COMMISSION IS A SET. SET THE COST. SET THE PAYMENT BASED ON WHAT THE COSTS ACTUALLY ARE. I IN SO BY PUTTING. SOMEBODY A FICTITIOUS CHART UP THERE AS TO WHAT BUT EVEN THOUGH WE'VE SAID. WE'VE SAID TIME AND AGAIN THERE'S A ME FLEXIBILITY WITH COMMISSION WHAT I MEAN BY PETITIONS OF NO ONE OF SADNESS AT HOW TO DRIVE SENT ACROSS THE BOARD. DOES ALLOW THIS REPEATED EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS HUNDREDS OF YOU BY THE HOUSE TO BE USED TIME AND AGAIN I'VE SEEN DOZENS OF LETTERS WITH THAT CLEARLY THE FOLKS ABOUT THOSE LETTERS AND ACTUALLY THE BILL. BECAUSE IF THEY HAD A REALIZE NO ONE IS SUGGESTING SETTING RATES AT HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE PERCENT AND IT ALSO DOESN'T ACCOUNT FOR ALL THE DIFFERENT. ADJUSTMENTS THAT CAN BE MADE THAT HOSPITALS AND AND. PROVIDERS ACTUALLY SEE CLINTON IN REAL TIME. AND SO. THAT'S WHY IT'S NOT VERY HELPFUL TO HAVE A CHART ALTHOUGH I DO. UNDERSTAND WHY BUT IN THOSE NUMBERS OUT THERE AYE IS EASIER. BUT THEN ACTUALLY. LOOKING AT WHAT THE BILL DOES AND DOES NOT. IF I MAY THOUGH ASSEMBLY MEMBER IF THE BILL SPECIFIED THE NUMBER WE COULD GIVE YOU AN EXACT. NUMBER. YOU NEED EARLY OFFERING OF THE BILL HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PERCENT MEDICARE IS WHAT WAS BEING DISCUSSED THAT'S WHY WE MODELED IT. IF THE BILL SPECIFICALLY TELLS US WHAT PERCENT OF MEDICARE WE COULD MODEL THAT. AS WELL WOULD BE HAPPY THAT IS NOT WHAT WAS DISCUSSED IN THE BILL WAS SIMPLY AS AN EFFORT TO. DEMONSTRATE TO STAKEHOLDERS WHAT THE WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THE COMMISSION IS AND SAID HONEY TWENTY FIVE COM HUNDRED KEEPER SENT DOT DOT DOT. THEY TOOK HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE US WERE SAYING WAS GONNA HAPPEN IT'S FALSE. I UNDERSTAND WHY THEY'RE BEING SOME DESIRE FOR FOR. THE CONFUSION CREATED HERE OFTENTIMES IS INTENTIONAL. ARM THAT IS NOT WHAT WE EVER SUGGESTED AND SO THAT'S WHY I'M SAYING IT'S NOT HELPFUL. THE CONVERSATION AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE A NUMBER BECAUSE WE'RE NOT THIS BILL DOES NOT SET A NUMBER. IF WE DID IDIOT WHOLLY DIFFERENT CONVERSATION AND I THINK TO BE SOME MERIT DARDEN'S ME MADE OPPOSITION IF THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL ACTUALLY DID IT'S JUST THAT HAVE US IS THAT IS THAT IS THAT A NUMBER. VOTER RESPECT NOT A COUNTERPOINT COUNTERPOINT HERE IT'S NOT SIXTY MINUTES TODAY. BUT BUT JUST PLEASE ADDRESS THE QUESTION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I IDEA LIKE. HAVEN'T HEARD FROM KAISER PERMANENTE ON THIS. I KNOW THEY HAD SOME CONCERNS I DON'T OF PAIRS OF REPRESENTATIVE WOULD LIKE TO. AT LEAST SPEAK TO SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS. IF MISTER CHAIR YOU. A COMFORTABLE IN ALLOWING SOMETIMES. COUPLE MINUTES HERE. AND AND NO PRESSURE TERESA. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER IS THERE AND. WE DID SEND IN AN OPPOSE LETTER. WE DO HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH THE BILL FRANKLY FOR. ALL THE REASONS YOU YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT TODAY. JUST IN TERMS OF THE IMPACT ON OUR OUR DELIVERY SYSTEM. TO THE EXTENT. AND AGAIN IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT THEY THE IMPACT WOULD BE IN TERMS OF MONEY BEING REMOVED FROM THE SYSTEM BUT. WE HAVE THIRTY SIX HOSPITALS IN CALIFORNIA AND. FOUR HUNDRED MEDICAL OFFICE BUILDINGS AND WE I WORK WITH OUR MEDICAL GROUPS TWELVE THOUSAND POSITIONS AND SO IT WOULD HAVE. SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO RUN OUR INTEGRATED DELIVERY SYSTEM SOUP MORE SPECIFICALLY SINCE YOU ARE AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM. CAN YOU ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY THE IMPACT WOULD BE BECAUSE I THINK THERE WERE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN TO CLARIFY THAT THE BILL IS NOT INTENDED TO IMPACT CONTRACTED RATES. SO THE CAPITATED RATE THAT WE PAY ARE DELEGATED MEDICAL GROUP THIS SPONSORS ARE. NODDING BUT. THE HEALTH PLAN WOULD BE SET WOULD BE PAID ARRAY BASED ON MEDICARE ADVANTAGE. SO. WE WOULD STILL BE EXPECTED TO RUN OUR DELIVERY SYSTEM. WITH A RATE THAT WOULD BE VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE GET TODAY. SO WHILE THEY'RE NOT INTENDING TO IMPACT THE CONTRACTED RATES. WHICH MAKES SENSE BECAUSE THAT. REALLY IS SORT OF RATE SETTING IT'S AGREED TO BETWEEN THE PAIR IN THE PROVIDER AND THAT'S HOW YOU GET TO VALUE. AND. YOU KNOW OUTCOMES PERFORMANCE SPACE CARE WHICH IS WHAT WE ALL WANT TO ACHIEVE. BUT IF YOU. THEORETICALLY LOWER WHAT WE'RE GETTING DIDN'T AS THE PAIR. THEN THAT'S LESS MONEY IN THE SYSTEM FOR EVERYTHING ELSE. THANK. OKAY. BUT ONCE OF. LIKE YOUR CONVERSATION BUT I. WE GOT THAT WERE SHAKING HER HEAD TO GET WELL GIVEN WHAT I'M HEARING THOUGH IT FOR FIRST OF ALL IF IF YOU DON'T TRY TO TAKE A CERTAIN STEP AND. IN IN IN ADDRESSING AN ISSUE YOU'RE NEVER GONNA MOVE. AND PART OF THE CHALLENGE OF WHAT I'M HEARING RIGHT NOW AND WHAT WE USUALLY HERE. IS JUST THE NEGATIVES OF WHAT'S SOMETHING. OF OF HOW SOMETHING IS NOT GOING TO WORK. INSTEAD OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN MAKE SOMETHING WORK. I'M NOT WILLING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY BECAUSE. OF AND I DON'T WANT TO ELABORATE ON JUST THE NEGATIVES. I THINK IF IF THERE IS A BODY THAT'S COMMISSION TO LOOK AT SOMETHING FULL TIME. IT'S NOT. FAR OUT OF REACH THAT IT CAN POTENTIALLY TRIED TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES. AND IT CAN'T BE MORE CHALLENGING THAN WHAT WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH RIGHT NOW WHEN. SOME OF THE A LOT OF THE SOLUTIONS ARE. COMPROMISED TO THE POINT WHERE IT BECOMES. RELATIVELY INEFFECTIVE OR. ALICE MARGINAL OF IMPACT. BUT WILL ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT WAS MORE OF JUST THE ACCOUNTABILITY. OF OF THIS COMMISSION. AT WHAT WHEN YOU ESTABLISH IT. YOU'RE NOT VOTING FOR THESE PEOPLE THESE ARE SELECTED INDIVIDUALS. SO. WHAT ARE THE PRESSURES THAT WILL FORCE UP? FORCE UPON THIS BODY. TELL. HOW IT MAKES DECISIONS AND HOW IT MANEUVERS AND HOW? A IT RESPONDS MOST. IMPORTANTLY. VIDEO IS THIS SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE BETTER SERVED IF IT WAS UNDER THE. INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS. A DEPARTMENT SO THAT THERE IS A POLITICAL ENTITY WHO GETS ELECTED STATEWIDE WHO THEN. IS MORE ACCOUNTABLE LIKE. THAT I'M. I HAVEN'T THOUGHT THIS THROUGH I JUST WANTED TO SUGGEST THAT ONLY BECAUSE I FELT THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY ON THIS BODY. SURE YEAH AND MISS SHARE OF A GOOD I I APPRECIATE THAT CONCERNED I THINK THAT THE KEY IS TO MAKE AS TO THAT MUCH INDEPENDENT. I DO NOT HAVE SIMPLY HAVE ELECTED OFFICIALS ON IT BECAUSE WE SEE WHAT'S HAPPENED IN OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM AND AND. IT IN HOW ELECTIONS ARE WON AND LOST IF YOU HAVE A JUST UNDER THE INSURANCE COMMISSION THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE ELECTED INDIVIDUAL. THAT WOULD HAVE ALL THAT POWER. AND THAT'S WHY THE THOUGH THE APPOINTEES ARE SELECTED FROM THREE DIFFERENT. OF MOVIE THE GUBERNATORIAL SENATE ASSEMBLY OF WHICH ALLOWS FOR THE CROSS SECTION ALSO. OF IT IF IT DETAILS THE KINDS OF PEOPLE WE WANT ON IT. BICU ONE FOLKS I DO HAVE. CERTAIN AGREES EXPERTISE OTHER TERM LIMITED AS WELL. OF A EN AND SO. THERE THERE'S ALWAYS GONNA BE A QUESTION AS TO WHAT THE PEOPLE DO THE RIGHT THING I THINK WHAT YOU DO IS GREAT INDEPENDENT SYSTEM. THAT HAS COMPLEMENT JUST RULES IN PLACE THAT HAD BEEN HAS SOME TRANSPARENCY OPEN MEETINGS AND THEN YOU ALLOW THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE WHICH IS MADE UP OF A WIDE RANGE OF FOLKS WHO INDUSTRY. THAT ADVISE THEM AGAIN IN A VERY OPEN AND TRANSPARENT MANNER AND YOU GET THE MOST OUT OF ACTION CAN MONEY CAN DO THE DETAILS TO THE RESEARCH. DO THE STUDY AND DO THE HOMEWORK I IS THERE A FULL PROOF WAY. I DON'T KNOW IF WE FOUND ONE YET BUT IT IS FULL PROOF IS IT CAN GET IT'S NOT DIFFERENT THAN OTHER COMMISSIONS OF THE STATE IS EMPLOYED AND I THINK THAT. THIS COMMUNE OPPORTUNITY GET INDEPENDENT FOLKS ARE FOCUSING ON THE DATA AND INFORMATION NOT ON THE POLITICS. AND MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY I I JUST. THANK YOU FOR THE ANSWER I I DON'T THINK THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR ONLY BECAUSE IT'S. WE'RE CHANGING THERE'S A SYSTEM HERE. ADAM AND AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO JUST PLACE INDIVIDUALS WHO. UP WILL NOT HAVE CERTAIN PRESSURES ON THEM TO PERFORM. AND TO BE ACCOUNTABLE SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO. BE MINDFUL OF AND WORK THROUGH. SO ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS ABSOLUTELY I THINK. MR MCCARTY. AND THEN MISTER SANTIAGO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR PATRICK MISTER KALRA. I. WON'T ASK YOU ONE ONE QUESTION. LOT OF QUESTIONS ASKED I COULD ASK PLENTY MORE BUT. IT'S IN LATE BUT BEFORE THAT I AM GOING TO VOTE FOR THE BILL. AN IMPERFECT SOLUTION SOMEWHAT UNEASY. BUT I DO THINK AS MR BONTA SAID WE HAVE. UNSUSTAINABLE ESCALATING COSTS THAT WE'RE NOT ADDRESSING AND THE CURRENT SITUATION. IS IS NOT GOING TO WORK. SOME NOT SO MY QUESTION IS THIS. IN THE NECK WITH A LITTLE OF THIS WILL HAPPEN TO ME IN THE NEXT. FEW DAYS OR WEEKS I'LL BE WALKING AROUND MY NEIGHBORHOOD WITH MY DOG. AND I WON'T RUN INTO A NO OFFENSE A HOSPITAL. EXECUTIVE I WON'T RUN INTO AN HMO EXECUTIVE BUT I WILL RUN INTO A DOCTOR. PROBABLY A FAMILY DOCTOR AND THEY'LL BE UNEASY ABOUT THE SQUEEZE. SO WHAT WOULD YOU TELL. POSITIONS OUT THERE. WITH THAT. YOU KNOW THEY MAY NOT BE SPECIALISTS NAY MAIM NAY MAYBE APPETITE AS SOON THAT MAYBE THEY DON'T PUTS BUT THEY'RE GOING TO FEEL THAT THIS WILL SQUEEZE. THE AVERAGE DOCTOR IN CALIFORNIA. WHAT WOULD YOU TELL THEM? TO. TO ATTEMPT TO SATISFY THEIR KIDS. WHY WAS START BY SAYING THAT? THAT THIS BILL IS NOT INTENDED TO SQUEEZE. DAM. BUT THE BALLY PRACTITIONERS ARE ANY DOCTOR FOR THAT MATTER BUT YOU'RE YOU'RE RAISING THE ISSUE SPECIFICALLY AND I UNDERSTAND WHY FAMILY PRACTITIONERS SOLO PRACTITIONERS. OTHER ALREADY FEELING SQUEEZE RIGHT NOW WITH GRINS. AND UP IN MANY CASES THEY'RE UNDERPAID. AND I THINK THAT THIS BILL WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY PAY THEM WHAT THEY DESERVE. ALLOW THE COMMERCIAL RATES THEY DON'T RESPECT US ALL PRACTITIONERS WHAT LEVERAGE THEY HAVE RIGHT NOW. TO INCREASE THE RACE THEY GET. VERY LITTLE. THIS WILL ACTUALLY GIVE THEM THE OPTION TO HAVE SOME LEVERAGE AND HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY. NUMBER CONTINUE UP TO WORK AS A FAMILY PRACTITIONER OR PEDIATRICIAN. IN IN THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH THEY LIVE. AND W. DO HAPPEN DISHES IN THERE THAT INCLUDE CONSIDERATION A WORKFORCE NEEDS ROGAN A BE PUTTING OF RESOURCES INTO FUNDS THAT RIGHT NOW ARE SEVERELY UNDERFUNDED. TO HELP WITH THE MEDICAL SCHOOL DEBT AND TRAINING FOR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS. IN ORDER TO BUILD A PIPELINE BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY THAT. TO ANY INDIVIDUAL DOCTOR NOT FRANKLY SAID THIS TO A NUMBER OF THEM THAT HAVE CALLED ME PERSONALLY AND TALKING ABOUT THIS BILL TALKED MY STAFF ABOUT THIS BILL. EYES OTHERS DOES NOT ABOUT TARGETING DOCTORS THERE'S AND AND THAT WE WANT DOCTORS OTHER DOCTORS AND HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS I DO MOST SERVICE. I TO GET PAID. IN AND TO GET THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO CONTINUE IN PRACTICE. THERE'S A YOUNG DOCTOR. THEY NOT ONLY HAVE TO CONSIDER. THEIR PRACTICE FOR THE NEXT FOUR FIVE YEARS BUT THAT IT THE NEXT HOPEFULLY THIRTY FORTY PLUS YEARS. AND SO THE SYSTEMS UNSUSTAINABLE DOES A BENEFIT THEM AND THE WAY THAT THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN GOING AS WE EVEN HEARD FROM MISTER BIGELOW LOT OF PRACTICE ARE CLOSING DOWN BUT THE CURRENT SYSTEM. SO WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO CREATE A SYSTEM THAT SUSTAINABLE AND THAT INCLUDES ENSURING IT SUSTAINABLE FOR DOCTORS. AND MISTER. MCCARTY IF I MAY AT SEIU REPRESENTS. THE COMMITTEE OF. INTERNS AND RESIDENTS. WHO ARE AN AMAZING GROUP OF US STUDENT PHYSICIANS WHO ALSO DEDICATE THEIR TIME TO THE UNION? AND THERE IS A A BIT OF GOOD NEWS IN THIS PICTURE. CALIFORNIA RANKS FIRST IN THE NATION FOR PERCENTAGES OF BOTH MEDICAL STUDENTS AND RESIDENTS WHO CHOOSE TO REMAIN IN THE STATE. AND. OUR GOAL CERTAINLY IS NOT TO SEE THEM OF LEAVE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WILL POINT OUT YOU TO IS KIND OF AT A POINT IN HISTORY WHEN. UP PRIOR LEGISLATURE PASSED NURSE STAFFING RATIOS CALIFORNIA WAS UNDER A TERRIBLE NURSE AS NURSING SHORTAGE. AND THE RATIOS HELPED TO. COMPEL. DOES THE GOVERNOR GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS AND SUBSEQUENTLY GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER TO INVEST NINETY MILLION DOLLARS INTO A NURSE TRAINING AND EDUCATION. WE HAVE ERASE THE NURSING SHORTAGE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS A RESULT AND I DO THINK THAT ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE CAN GET TO ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING ON PHYSICIAN RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION AND LOAN REIMBURSEMENT. IS BY. CREATING A SIGNIFICANT POLICY CHANGE BECAUSE ITIT'S BEEN FAR TOO LONG SINCE WE'VE SEEN A REAL DECENT INVESTMENT IN LOW REIMBURSEMENT FOR PHYSICIANS HOUSES. A FOLLOW UP LOS YOU KALRA I KNOW THAT THAT. CHANGES HARD TO THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING IN THE GET CHANGES PRODUCT TO CANCEL. ONE CAN'T IS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT CERTAIN OF THE DEVICE. TERRIBLE THINGS CAN HAPPEN. THE OTHER CAMP IS CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC. ON THE UPSIDE IT'S MY CHANGES SO HARD. SO ARE YOU ARE YOU. ARGUING THAT. THE THAT'S THAT THAT YOU COULD MAKE A STRAIGHT FACE THAT A GREAT NUMBER OF DOCTORS WOULD BUT HAVE THEIR SITUATIONS. ARE INCREASE AS FAR AS THAT THAT THAT THE FINANCIAL WHEREWITHAL AND THAT. THAT BY. MAKING SOME ADJUSTMENTS AT THE ENDS THAT THAT WHOLE OVER ALL THAT MANY THAT MORE THAN. FIFTY PERCENT ARE CERTAIN POTENTIALLY BETTER OFF. WELL. CERTAINLY UP WHO AGREE NUMBER THEM WOULD I CAN CERTAINLY SAY THAT AND I CAN THAT'S OUR GOAL. OUR GOAL IS TO DO THAT BECAUSE WE DO KNOW THAT THEIR PLENTY. OF SOLO PRACTITIONERS WHETHER THEY'RE IN URBAN AREAS WITH THEIR MIDDLE CLASS NEIGHBORHOODS OR RULE COMMUNITIES OTHER STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW. AND OUR GOAL IS TO. MAKE THEIR PRACTICES SUSTAINABLE. AS AS MUCH AS IT IS TO MAKE. HEALTHCARE COSTS FOR BUSINESSES AND PROFOUNDLY SUSTAINABLE AS WELL. SANTIAGO NAY MISSING HERE. MISTER KALRA GOD BLESS YOU FOR TAKING UP THIS ISSUE. LOOK I'M NOT I'M NOT IN LOVE WITH THIS BILL. FOR SHARON IN UNITED HAD SOME CONVERSATIONS. BUT I WILL SAY THAT I'M HEAD OVER HEELS AND SWEPT OFF MY FEET ON THE ABILITY TO CONTAIN COSTS. AND THAT MOTIVATES ME. ABOUT THE WANT TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TO GET OUT DRIVE TO GET AMERICAN CONVERSATION. I DO UNDERSTAND AND AGREE WITH THE FACT THAT HEALTHCARE IS RISING AND WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO CONTAIN A. REDUCE ITS COST. AND SURE THAT EVERYBODY HAS QUALITY HEALTHCARE. MONTH I I AM SYMPATHETIC. TOWARDS THOSE AT THE BARGAINING TABLE. CONTINUING TO HAVE TO FIGHT OVER THIS ISSUE OVER AND OVER AND OVER. AND. WHAT WHAT I HAD A CHALLENGE WITH IT AND ALL SAY IT? OUT LOUD ALTHOUGH UNITED TALKED IN AND SPONSORS OF TALK. IT IS. YOU KNOW I CHALLENGE WITH TARGETING PEOPLE. AND YOU KNOW MY DOCTOR PERSON TOO OBVIOUS. AND IN FACT I LOVE MY DOCTOR AND MOST OF YOU KNOW I'VE RECENTLY HAD SURGERY AND. HAD SURGERY HE CALL THE NEXT MORNING CONTINUE TO CALL THE ONCE EVERY COUPLE WEEKS. AND I KINDA LIKE THE FACT THAT YOUMAY BE IN THE SYSTEM FOR SOME TIME I KINDA LIKE THE FACT THAT HE MAY HAVE MADE. A LOT OF MONEY BECAUSE IT MOTIVATES THEM TO DO BETTER. AND IT MOTIVATED THEM TO GIVE ME THE BEST QUALITY OF CARE. AND. IN MY CHALLENGE WITH THE BILL ORIGINALLY. IT IS THAT. ALTHOUGH I HERE NOW CLEARLY IT'S NOT TARGETING PROVIDERS WHEN I REDID IT DID LOOK LIKE IT'S TARGETING PROVIDERS. AND AND. AND. I WAS IN A PHILOSOPHICAL. SAME REASON THAT I WANT TO PROTECT THE NURSE. NURSES WAIT FOR THE SAME REASON I WANT PROTECT A JANITOR'S WHAT WAGE INCREASE AND FOR THE SAME REASONS THAT I WANT. A CONSTRUCTION TRADES. EMPLOYED TO INCREASE HIS OR HER WAGE IS THE SAME REASON NOW PHILOSOPHIC THAT I HAVE TO BE CHALLENGED TO. ALLOW SOMEBODY TO DO THE BEST THEY POSSIBLY CAN. IN THE MARKETPLACE. I DO ACKNOWLEDGE. THAT THERE ARE SOME. BUT I WOULD CALLS THROUGH SOME. EXAGGERATED COST OR OR REAL HIGH COST. I MEAN CERTAINLY EARNED IS CERTAINLY IN THE SPECIALTIES. SPECIAL SPECIAL PROCEDURES CERTAINLY AN UNPLANNED PROCEDURES. I KNOW WHICH BUT THIS IS THE DILEMMA THAT I MEAN. I WAS ALSO LITTLE BIT HARD PRESSED. COULD BECAUSE SEVERAL YEARS AGO I POSED A BILL THAT HAD A SIMILAR PARADISE. AND I THINK IT'S A BUT A BILL THAT MISTER BONTA CARRIED. I HOPE I GET THE NUMBER RIGHT. AB THREE FIVE FIVE. BECAUSE IT DID CITY FLOOR IN THE DID TALK ABOUT GOING TO A PANEL. AND IDEA AT THAT POINT AT THAT POINT HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT. THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS FEASIBLE. MEANING SETTING A FLOOR AND DOCTORS EARLIER BOTH OF THIS PANEL TO. TO PROTEST THE INCOME I MEAN THE THE. PROCEDURE PRICE OR WHAT THEY BRING IN SORRY. AND I'M HOPING THAT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE WORKED ON I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PERFECT SOLUTION IS AND AND ALL THE. ALL THAT I'VE SAID. BUT I AM COMFORTABLE WITH UNDERSTANDING WHERE YOU'RE TRYING TO GET IN THAT SOMETHING THAT I WANT TO SUPPORT AND I WOULD URGE. ALL TO SUPPORT. UNFORTUNATELY RAN OUT OF TIME AND WE'VE GOT TO GET THIS. SIDE I THINK CONVERSATION CONTINUE. LOOK I'M STILL SKEPTIC ON THE COMMISSION. I I'VE SEVEN NUMBER OF TIMES RIGHT AYE. AYE A LIST OWNER I'M WITH YOU KNOW IT SHOULD BE STATE DEPARTMENT HOW LIKE THE IDEAS WITH ON OUR ULTIMATELY YOU WILL MAKE THE DECISION AS TO WHAT THE. THE FAIREST APPROACH. MIGHT BE. AT BOTH. BUDDHA CONSULTING WITH THEIR SPONSORS AND HOPEFULLY CONSULTING WITH THE OPPOSITION. AND HOW LIKE A A I JUST FINE HARD IN SOME CASES TO BELIEVE. THAT IT DIDN'T A BILL WE CREATE A FAIR SYSTEM. BUT BUT I'M HOPEFUL THAT IF ANYONE CAN DO IT. HEY I IT'S GOING TO BE YOU KNOW I'M HOPEFUL ALSO THAT YOU PUT SOME SORT OF. STAKEHOLDER PROCESS TOGETHER AND THAT YOU WILL AND THAT YOU WILL TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION. WITH THE OPPOSITION SAYS I THINK THAT THAT'S MERITED AYE IT'S HARD TO FORESEE A COMMISSION. DESIGNING A RATES THAT ARE GOING INCLUDE FACILITY UPGRADES ARE THEY'RE GONNA INCLUDE. IT. ANY NATURAL BECAUSE I ME WHAT HAPPENS IF THE FACILITY UPGRADE HAPPENS IMMEDIATELY OR A NEW FACILITY HAS TO COME ON LIVES EVERYBODY'S. PRICES SPIKE UP FOR ONE YEAR AND THEN GO DOWN FOR ANOTHER YEAR LEGAL QUESTIONS ARE HARD. TO ANSWER. BUT I RECOGNIZE ROLL THIS TOGETHER. BUT I DO HAVE HE CHALLENGED. ORIGINALLY WHEN I READ THE BILL AND FELT LIKE IT TARGETED SPECIFIC GROUP OF PEOPLE AND I HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF IT. I AND I'M CONFIDENT THE DOOR CONVERSATIONS THAT YOU'LL ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS IT'S HIM FOR I WILL FACE. A. GOOD GOD RESERVE MY RIGHT THE TAKE A LOOK AT IT AGAIN ON THE FLOOR. AYE BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT CONVERSATION HAD AND. GOD BLESS YOU FOR DOING IT. I CAN THINK OF ANYBODY BETTER THAT WOULD TAKE UP THE CHALLENGE. I AND THE HUSTLE OF DOING THIS THANK YOU. THE SECULAR CURRY. THANK YOU SO MEMBER CARL FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND ADDRESSING ALL THE QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. I'VE SAID TIME AND TIME AGAIN WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE HEALTH CARE FOR ALL ON WHAT YOU NEED. ME THROUGH A FOLLICLE. BE RESPECTFUL. AND NOT LEAVE ANYBODY OUT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAME UP TODAY THAT AND WE DON'T NEED GOING TO DETAIL NOW BECAUSE BEEN A LONG TIME AND I MEAN MISTER WHEN I STEPPED OUT BUT. MAJOR DRIVER FOR THE HEALTH CARE. WE RECOGNIZES LOW MEDI CAL REIMBURSEMENT RATES INS NOT ADDRESSED IN THE BILL THAT I CAN SEE. THE OTHER THING I WOULD WANT TO COME BACK AND TALK TO YOU ABOUT IS. HECK WE COMPASS THIS BILL DOES SEEKING INCREASED MEDI CAL RATES AS WELL. SO THOSE A COUPLE THINGS BUT RECURSOS FIVE BEEN ANSWERED BUT I AM VERY CONCERNED I'M A REAL COMMUNITY WE HAVE FORTY PERCENT FORTY SIX PERCENT ON MEDI CAL. I I APPRECIATE YOU SAYING RURAL SO MUCH BUT WHEN YOU SAY RURAL I WANT YOU TO REALIZE RURAL NORTH TO SACRAMENTO. BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE OUR DISTRICT IT'S LEFT OUT A LOT AND I WOULD LIKE YOU I WOULD LIKE THEM SO I'M HOPING I CAN GET YOUR COMMITMENT TODAY. THAT WE WILL HAVE SOMEONE ON YOUR COMMISSION FROM A RURAL AREA THAT OBVIOUSLY HAS THAT IS THE QUALIFICATIONS. AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE SOME REPRESENTATION IN OUR AREA. AMID A VOTE FOR YOUR BILL TODAY. BECAUSE I WANT TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION I SAID YESTERDAY IN A. BILL OF RUNNING SPLIT TOUGHEST AS IF NOT NOW WHEN. NEW. I KNOW I WON DYING TO WORK WITH I DIDN'T CATCH YOUR NAME IS ON THE OPPOSITION TO YOUR BRAND NEW. I AM JUST REALLY INTRIGUED WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF GREEN TO THE TABLE AND THAT YOUR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH EVERYONE. AND I CAN'T WAIT TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS BILL FURTHER. SO I'M ASKING ALL OF YOU. SPONSORS OF THE OPPONENTS. TO WORK TOGETHER. BECAUSE YOU KNOW IS NOT AN ANSWER. AND. I MEAN VOTE FREE TODAY BUT I WANT TO MAKE IT REALLY CLEAR SO THERE'S NO MISTAKE WHEN IT COMES TO THE FLOOR. IF I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH IT THEN AND THEY'VE ALL WORKED TOGETHER TO. HAVE SOME KIND OF COLLABORATION AND. RESPECT FOR THE WHOLE SYSTEM. I'M NOT I MEA I CAN AFFORD SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH LONG GUIDE YOU CAUGHT ME AS SAYING RULE OUT. AS. AND I ALSO EXCITED ABOUT WORKING WITH CAMILLA CLEARLY SOMEONE THAT BRINGS A LOT OF EXPERTISE. OKAY I THINK EVERYBODY HAS SPOKEN EXCEPT FOR ME. AND I GOT A LOT OF NOTES AND I'M NOT GONNA BELIEVE FOR A LOT OF POINTS BUT IT THERE ARE SOME. MYTHS I'M A PUT SOME THINGS OUT THERE THAT I THINK ARE IMPORTANT THAT THAT DIDN'T COME UP POSSIBLY. OR DICK CAME UP THAT I MAY MAY NOT AGREE WITH. NOBODY TALKED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN MEDICARE RATES GO DOWN THAT ONE POINT THREE TRILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT INCREASE IS GOING TO CAUSE MEDICARE RATES TO GO DOWN. THAT'S ALSO CAN AFFECT MEDICAID. THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE GOING FORWARD. AND ALTHOUGH SAVINGS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAY EVAPORATE. WITH THOSE DECREASE IN MEDICARE RATES. THIS IS MORE COMMENTARY NOT ASKING TO CONTENT JUMP JUSTICES COMMENTARY. TALKED ABOUT HOSPITALS BEING A DRIVER IN THE COST AND THEY ARE THE LEADING COST OF I BELIEVE THAT CAME FROM. MICHELLE CREEK CABRERA ABOUT THEIR THAT THE LEADING COST ABOUT THE FASTEST GROWING COST. THAT MAY BE TRUE. BUT. DRUG PRICES ARE ONE OF THE REASONS THAT HOSPITALS ARE. COSTS ARE GOING UP AND SURGERY CENTERS AND THOSE ARE SIGNIFICANT SO WE LEARNED THAT LAST YEAR WE TALKED ABOUT DRUG PRICES. YES DRUG PRICES MAY BE ON DRUGS MAY ONLY BE THIRTEEN PERCENT BUT WHEN YOU FACTOR IN HOSPITALS AND SURGERY CENTERS THAT NUMBER GOES UP TO OVER TWENTY. SO SO. JUST PUTTING THE INFORMATION PRINT IT MAY INFORMATION OUT THERE. I AM CONCERNED WE HEARD A BILL TODAY WE HAVE TWENTY HOSPITALS WE WE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT SEISMIC EXTENSION ON SEISMIC. HUNDRED AND TEN BILLION DOLLARS. WHAT WHAT HAPPENS IN THE FUTURE OUR ABILITY TO REBUILD HOSPITALS LOMA LINDA IS TEARING DOWN A HOSPITAL IN BUILDING A MILLION SQUARE FEET I CAN'T EVEN COMPREHEND A MILLION SQUARE FEET? I CANNOT COMPREHEND MILLION ANYTHING. BUT THAT IS A HUGE HUGE COST HUGE COST AND THAT'S THAT'S SIGNIFICANT. STUDENT DEBT I WISH IT WAS TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR FOR RESIDENTS GET NOW SCHOOL BUT THAT NUMBER IS. FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IS WAY HIGHER THAN THAT. AND WHILE YOU DID SO SOMEONE DID SAY THAT YEAH THERE WE'VE WE HAVE NIPPED THE BOTTOM ON NURSING SHORTAGES NOT MY DISTRICT. HUMBOLDT COUNTY. NURSING SHORTAGE CRISIS. AND SO WHILE I APPRECIATE THE NUMBER OF TIMES YOU SAID RURAL. YOU OUGHT TO COME TO MY DISTRICT. YOU DON'T KNOW RURAL INTO YOU'VE ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED IT COME TO MISS AGUIAR-CURRY. FLORA. PARTS MISTER MAYES MISTER BIGELOW. CHALLENGES ARE DIFFERENT. THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT AND EVEN WITH INCREASE MEDICARE RATES. I DON'T SEE HOW WE GET DOCTORS WHERE WE NEED THEM TO GET BECAUSEWE HAVE TO PAY DOCTORS WERE THAT WE HAVE TO HELP THEIR EDUCATION AND SO. YOU TALKED ABOUT INST PEOPLE SOMEONE TALK BUT IN THE INDUSTRIAL KIND EYES COUNTRIES AND HOW THEY HAVE. THE ONE THING THAT THEY'VE ALL DONE TO IT TO MAKE HEALTHCARE MORE AFFORDABLE IS IS FIX PRICES. THERE'S TWO THINGS. OTHER THING THEY'VE DONE IS SUBSIDIZED MEDICAL EDUCATION FOR ALL PROVIDERS NOT JUST DOCTORS. BUT NURSES AND EVERYONE ELSE. SO WE NEED TO GET THAT OUT THAT THAT'S A BIG BIG COMPONENT FOR US GOING FORWARD. I COULD GO ON. AND I I I DO GET CONCERNED ABOUT. WHEN REVENUES GO DOWN BUT THIS AT MEAN TO THE WORK FORCE. AND. AND I I DO HAVE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT DOT SO. A LOT A LOT HERE. BUT I WANT TO SAY YOU KNOW. I KNOW THE COST IN AFFORDABILITY IS IS A REAL PROBLEM ONCE A PERSONAL STRUGGLE FOR SO MANY PEOPLE SO MANY PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT. AND I'M GOING THROUGH. AT FAMILY ISSUE NOW WITH. RELATIVES BEEN HOSPITAL FOR ALMOST FOUR WEEKS. I SHUDDER TO THINK WHAT THAT'S GOING TO COST IN THE AND. I DON'T HOW OR HOW MANY DOCTORS WHO HAVE SEEN. SCENE. SEEN THIS PERSON. AND IT'S A IT'S YOU CHALLENGES AND FAMILIES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY ARE STRUGGLING WITH THIS SO COST IS A REAL REAL ISSUE. IN OUR CAPITAL DISTRICT OFFICES WE'VE GOT HUNDREDS OF CALLS IT'S NOT AN EXAGGERATION HUNDREDS OF CALLS. WE KNOW THAT THEIR FEARS ARE REAL AND SOME OF THESE FEARS ARE GENERATED FROM THAT CHALLENGES E'RE FACING WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WHO'S LOOKING FOR WAYS TO TO TO MAKE OUR LIVES HARDER HERE. AS HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AS AS HOSPITALS OR WHATEVER TO PROVIDE CARE PEOPLE THAT REALLY NEED IT. I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS BECAUSE OF THEIR DEDICATION TO TRY TO TIP FOR HAVING THIS DISCUSSION. TRYING TO MAKE UP ABOUT HEALTHCARE MORE AFFORDABLE. I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE COURAGE. TO BRING UP A REAL DIFFICULT CONTROVERSIAL SUBJECT. AND YOUR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH ME IN MY STAFF TO ADDRESS SOME TO SOME ISSUES I TELL PEOPLE OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THAT. I'M AYE AYE. AYE ASK HARD QUESTIONS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO HAVE THE ANSWERS AND IT IS NOT IT IS NOT IN THE SPIRIT OF TRYING TO. SQUASH AND ISSUE IT'S IN THE SPIRIT OF TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AND BRING THOSE ISSUES OUT SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT THEM. I THINK YOU'VE WITNESSED TODAY. THAT MANY MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE HAVE QUITE FEW CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL AND WHETHER IT'S THE RIGHT APPROACH. I THINK EVERYONE ON THIS COMMITTEE WANTS TO ADDRESS COST CONTAINMENT. BUT THEY'RE NOT REALLY CONFIDENT THAT RATE REGULATIONS THE RIGHT RIGHT DIRECTION. I THINK IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS THE BILL'S GOING WITHOUT A COMMITTEE TODAY. AND. AS IT CONTINUES TO THE MOVE THROUGH THE PROCESS I HOPE TO BE OPEN TO FURTHER DISCUSSIONS YOU'VE HEARD MANY PEOPLE TALK ABOUT OF A ROBUST STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT IS POSSIBLE. I'D LIKE TO SEE THE A JUST FOR IT THE AT ISSUES ADDRESSED IN A WAY THAT INCENTIVIZE IS. COST CONTAINMENT. WHILE MINIMIZING THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS THAT THAT IT COULD HAVE. VERY DIFFERENT CARROT A CARROT. NOT NECESSARILY A STEP. AFTER THOSE TWO ARGUING AGAINST. AB THIRTY EIGHTY SEVEN. THANK YOU REALIZED YOU SHOULD REALIZE A COST CONTAINMENT ISN'T GOING AWAY. MAKERS TO HEAR THAT CMA AS ACCIDENT VOTE THEIR ENTIRE HOUSE OF DELEGATES TO THIS ISSUE. AS WE TALKED WITH. FORMA. THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS NO IS NOT. AN ADEQUATE ANSWER. RATING POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS TO THE TABLE WORK WITH US. IF THIS BILL IS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN THE LONG RUN A BILL WILL COME BACK. WE NEED TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY TO SOLVE THIS THIS IS A HUGE HUGE ISSUE FOR PEOPLE. AND. YOU KNOW. JUST. WE'VE GOT TO COME TOGETHER AND NOT NO NO CANNOT BE THE ANSWER. THAT THAT THERE'S TOO MUCH AT STAKE FOR CALIFORNIANS WE CANNOT CONTINUE DOWN THIS PATH. AND. I HOPE THAT IN THE SPIRIT OF THAT THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE CAN CONTINUE TO CONTINUE THESE DISCUSSIONS. WITH THAT. IS THE CHAIR LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL SO I CAN. YOU NO CLEARLY BILLS NOT PERFECT BUT I THINK THE AUTHOR IS DEMONSTRATED A FRAMEWORK. THAT CAN ADDRESS ALL THE ISSUES THAT CAME UP TODAY AND I WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR. FOR FIELDING ALL THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE COME UP TODAY. IN PARTICULAR THE CONCERNS THAT I HEARD ABOUT. ABOUT DOCTORS AND. FOR TAKING IT SINCERELY BECAUSE THERE WERE SERIOUS CONCERNS AND YOU'VE ADDRESSED THEM. I THINK THAT THIS BILL IS TAKING WHAT'S BEST ABOUT MARILYN. IT'S SAYING THAT WE CAN EXPAND ON IT. IN A CALIFORNIA KIND WAY. I REALLY APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUES WHO. REALLY BEEN DIRECT AND FORTHRIGHT ABOUT. WHAT THE LIKE WHAT THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT A I THINK THE CONVERSATIONS BEEN VERY ROBUST? AND IT CREATES A PATHWAY FOR HOW TO STRENGTHEN THE BILL. I APPRECIATE. THE UNIQUE. OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE MORE MEDI CAL ACCESS BY GIVING INCENTIVES TO THOSE POSITIONS WHO WILL SERVE THOSE. WHO ARE MEDI CAL I THINK IS A VERY? UNIQUE INTERESTING PROVISION IN THE BILL. AND I HOPE THAT ALL MY COLLEAGUES HERE WILL SUPPORT IT TODAY EVEN IF YOU HAVE CONCERNS AND GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH THE PROCESS. AND STAKEHOLDER PROCESS TO MOVE BEFORE I MOVE THE BILL FOR. SO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE HOPEFULLY BRIEFLY. THANK. THANK YOU MISS SUDDENLY HOT BUT ADEQUATELY. I PERCENT THINKING AS CHAIR AND YOU KNOW THE AMENDMENTS ARE MUCH OF WHICH WERE IN. INCLUDED BASED UPON STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK AS WELL AS FEEDBACK FROM THE CHAIR AND OTHER MEMBERS. OF OUR NINE AND THE JUST THE BEGINNING. TO THE CONVERSATION THAT IS REQUIRED GOING FORWARD IT THIS IS A OF OF UNFORTUNATE ABOUT THIS FILM WITH THIS COMMITTEE. AND AS INDICATED THAT DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. OR AS THE POP SYNDICATE IS TAKING ACCOUNT THE MAJOR DRIVERS HEALTH BECAUSE I BELIEVE THIS COMMISSION DOES HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO JUST THAT. TO THE GREATEST EXTENT WE POSSIBLY CAN THAT'S WHY INCLUDES PACIFIC CONCERNS REGARDING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS OF THE EDI CAL OF THE ISSUE. DOCTOR SHORTAGE IN ON ON. WHAT WE'RE DOING IS TRYING TO PUT IN PLACE SOME KIND OF COST AND WHAT WE'RE NOT DOING IS HAVING THE LEGISLATURE SET RATES AN ADHOC FASHION THAT? THAT ARE FIXED THAT ARE GOING TO A BOOTH THAT WOULD SOMEHOW. CRIPPLE THE ABILITY FOR DOCTORS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES WHAT HAPPENED A DOESN'T WORK WE'RE NOT TAKING OVER THE ACTUAL DELIVERY SYSTEM. TO GO BACK TO THE STATUS QUO. I AND I JUST WANTED. CLOSE BY TWO THINGS WHO BY COULD MISTER CHAIR OF A ONE IS THAT I UNDERSTAND HOW. POLITICS WORKS AND HOW ABOUT HIS USUAL WORKS IN THIS BUILDING IN MANY STATE HOUSES AROUND THE NATION. AND I WOULD JUST SAY THE STATUS QUO UP AN INITIAL LIKE THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. I'D THIS BILL MAKES OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE I RESPECTFULLY URGE OPPOSITION TO UP ó ABANDONED POLITICS AS USUAL PLEASE COME JOIN ME ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUES. SPONSORS OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. GIVE US SUGGESTIONS AND I PROBABLY WON A CLOSE BY THANKING THE CHAIR FOR HIS EXTRAORDINARY DEDICATION NOT JUST INVENTING THIS BILL. BUT DURING HIS ENTIRE TIME THE LEGISLATURE PARTICULARLY THE LAST YEAR AS THE ASSEMBLY IN THE SLOT COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF WORKED IDENTIFY CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE OUR HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. IS YOUR WORK ALONG WITH THE WORK MY COLLEAGUES THAT HAVE INSPIRED ME TO TAKE THIS PAST WAS MEANINGFUL COST CONTAINMENT OF AN INDUSTRY SO VITAL TO THE PEOPLE WE REPRESENT. I BELIEVE THAT HEALTHCARE IS A RIGHT. AND AS LEGISLATORS OF THIS GREAT STATE IF WE ABDICATE OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE IS AVAILABLE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. THEN WE'RE IGNORING WHEN THE GREATEST THREATS TO SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY. AND THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF FUTURE GENERATIONS. THE STATUS QUO ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME THE STATUS QUO ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR CALIFORNIANS I KNOW. THE STATUS QUO ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK ME I DON'T. THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN MISTER KALRA THANK YOU TO EVERYONE. SPONSORS OPPOSITION WITNESSES APPRECIATE APPRECIATE THE DIALOGUE MEMBERS. THEM SECRETARY. WE DO HAVE A MOTION SORRY WEBER MOTION TO HAVE A SISTER. THE MOTION OF THE MOTION IS BY MR THURMAN THE SECOND IS BY MISTER SANTIAGO THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS. AND SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL WOULD I THINK WOULD AYE MAYES. MAYES NO ANGER CURRY. AGAR CURRY I BIGELOW. BIGELOW NOW BONTA. BONTA AYE BURKE. CARILLO YES CARILLO AYE FLORA. FLORA NOVA MON. MCCARTY. MCCARTY AYE NAZARIAN AYE NAZARIAN AYE RODRIGUEZ. SANTIAGO AYE AYE SANTIAGO AYE THURMAN. THURMOND AYE WALDRON. WILDER NO. THE BILL IS OUT DATA FOR WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR OTHERS TO ADD ON THANK YOU MISTER KALRA THINK HEROES. WE'RE GONNA MOST MR MCCARTY FOR ONE BILL. AND HE'S GOING TO. WELL WELL. WELL YOU GET THE ONE FIRST. I WANTED TIME MISTER MISTER MCCARTY AND WRITTEN DIFFERENCE YOUR WITNESS THE FOLLOWED BY MR KILEY OKAY THIS RECORD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND. MEMBERS AND THANK YOU FOR COMMENTING. OUR WITNESS HERE. I HAVE BEFORE US SEVENTEEN FORTY FOUR. WHICH WOULD MAKE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA ELIGIBLE FOR FUNDING FROM PROP SIXTY FOR THE ADULT USE OF MARIJUANA ACTED FIRST I. WANT TO THANK OUR COMMITTEE OR STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US AS WE KNOW CALIFORNIA VOTERS PASSED THIS MEASURE UP TO BILLION DOLLARS WILL BE. BEFORE US TO DECIDE SIMILAR TO OUR CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM WILL HAVE A LOT OF GOOD IDEAS. LA DEBATE ON HOW TO SPEND THOSE MONIES I JUST WHAT DID WANT TO NOTE THAT WHEN THIS WAS BEFORE THE VOTERS IN THE BALLOT STATEMENT. IT PROMISE THAT THIS WOULD RAISE BILLIONS FOR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS TO HELP KIDS STAY IN SCHOOL. AND THERE WERE TV ADS THAT FOCUSED ON JUST THIS. PROP FIFTY FOUR FUNDS AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM SO THAT SAID THE MESSAGE IS VERY SIMPLE. WE SHOULD KEEP THAT PROMISE I MADE TO THE VOTERS AND FOCUS ON AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM TO SERVE ABOUT A HALF A MILLION KIDS. DEALING CALIFORNIA UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES DO A WORLD A GOOD KEEPING KID SAFE OUT OF TROUBLE AND THAT WITH ME TODAY. OUR I REPRESENT FOR A SACRAMENTO pCAPTAIN KATHY LESTER WHO HAVE KNOWN A LONG TIME WORKING HERE IN SACRAMENTO. AND THE CALIFORNIA AFTER SCHOOL ADVOCACY ALLIANCE. GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS KATHY LESTER A CAPTAIN WITH SACRAMENTO POLICE DEPARTMENT I'VE BEEN THERE FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS CURRENTLY AYE OVERSEAS DIVISION OF OUT REACHING ENGAGEMENT WHICH ENCOMPASSES ALL OF OUR SCHOOL PROGRAMS. AND OVERSEAS ABOUT FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND AYE CHILDREN SACRAMENTO CITY SCHOOLS I AM PLEASED TO REPRESENT SACRAMENTO POLICE CHIEF DANIEL HAHN. AND TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE FOUR HUNDRED MEMBERS OF FIGHT CRIME INVEST IN KIDS THIS IS AN ORGANIZATION OF POLICE CHIEFS SHERIFF'S DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND CRIME VICTIMS. AND CHIEF HAN HAS BEEN A LONG TIME MEMBER OF FIGHT CRIME INVEST IN KIDS. WE SUPPORT AB SEVENTEEN FORTY FOUR BECAUSE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS ARE CRITICAL TO EFFECTIVE CRIME FIGHTING EFFORTS. I UNDERSTAND THE MANY BENEFITS OF AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS NOT ONLY AS A WORKING PARENT OF THREE CHILDREN BUT ALSO FROM MY EXPERIENCES AS A POLICE OFFICER. WE KNOW THAT AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS KEEP KIDS ENGAGED THEY PREVENT CRIME AND THEY TEACH VALUABLE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL SKILLS WHICH HELP THEM BE SUCCESSFUL LATER IN LIFE. AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS HELPED CUT CRIME IMMEDIATELY BY KEEPING KIDS OFF THE STREETS AWAY FROM GANGS AND DRUGS DURING THE CRITICAL TIME OF THREE PM TO SIX PM. AND THEN THE LONG TERM THE IT ALSO HELPED CUT CRIME BY KEEPING KIDS ENGAGED IN SCHOOL. IMPROVING ATTENDANCE ON HELPING THEM DEVELOP STRONG RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ADULTS AND KEEPING KIDS ON TRACK TO GRADUATE. UCLA DID A STUDY RECENTLY. OF THE. OF AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THEY FOUND. WHILE TRACKING CHILDREN BETWEEN ELEMENTARY AND HIGH SCHOOL THAT KIDSTHAT PARTICIPATE IN AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS HAD A TWENTY PERCENT LESS CHANCE OF BEING A DROP OUT THERE WERE THIRTY PERCENT LESS LIKELY. TO ENGAGE IN CRIME. SO CALIFORNIA HAS MADE SOME GREAT INVESTMENTS IN AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. THEY AND SUPPORTING PROGRAMS OVER FOUR THOUSAND SCHOOLS DALY MORE FUNDING IS NEEDED TO SUSTAIN EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT STRUGGLE WITH LOW REIMBURSEMENT RATES. AND TO ESTABLISH NEW PROGRAMS INCLUDING I'M IN NEARLY THREE THOUSAND LOW INCOME SCHOOLS THAT RECEIVE A LITTLE OR NO STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING. INVESTING IMPROPER IS AIR INVESTING PROP A SIXTY FOUR FUNDS IN AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS MAKES COMMON SENSE AND THE CONNECTION IS REALLY VERY CLEAR. NOT ONLY DOES DRUG USE LIKE OTHER COMPLECTED BE PEAK AFTER SCHOOL RESEARCH SAYS THAT PARTICIPATING IN AFTER SCHOOL NOT ONLY REDUCES DECIDE DRUG USE BUT ALSO PROVIDES FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. AS WELL AS A PRODUCTIVE AND HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT FOR CALIFORNIA'S KIDS AND FOR THIS REASON LAW ENFORCEMENT LEADERS ACROSS THE STATE SUPPORT EIGHTY FORTY. AB SEVENTEEN FORTY FOUR THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE PERSPECTIVE. THE THINGS I THINK. YEAH. THIS. GOOD EVENING JENNIFER DIETRICH ON BEHALF OF THE PARTNERSHIP FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH AND THE CALIFORNIA AFTER SCHOOL ADVOCACY ALLIANCE WHERE. COALITION OF TWENTY MORE THAN TWENTY AFTER SCHOOLPROGRAMS AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS CALIFORNIA THAT SERB HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS. EACH DAY. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT AB SEVENTEEN FORTY FOUR TO HELP ENSURE THAT THE PROMISE OF PROP SIXTYFORCE CAT. SO THAT A PORTION OF THE TAX REVENUE WOULD GO TO AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA'S MOST UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY HAS ARTICULATED PROP SIXTY FOUR CAMPAIGN ADVERTISEMENTS PROMINENTLY FEATURED AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AS A. PRINT AS A PRIME BENEFICIARY. PROP SIXTY FOUR TAX REVENUE. BUT THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES THAT AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS WILL SEE A DIME. SO THAT'S WHY AB SEVENTEEN FORTY FOUR IS NEED AT. AND. IN ADDITION TO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY ASPECTS OF OF AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS THEY ALSO HELP TO PROVIDE HUNDREDS OF ADDITIONAL ACADEMIC HOURS AN ENRICHMENT ACTIVITIES FOR THE STUDENTS. WHO NEED THEM MOST? AFTERSCHOOL PROGRAMS FUNDED BY THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS. EIGHTY PERCENT OF THEM ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FREE AND REDUCED PRICE MEALS. BUT WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THESE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS ARE AT RISK OF SHUTTING DOWN PUBLIC FUNDING HASN'T KEPT PACE WITH THE RISING COSTS OF PROVIDING A QUALITY PROGRAM. IN DECEMBER WE DID A SURVEY OF AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS REPRESENTING MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. NINETY EIGHT PERCENT. OF STATE FUNDED AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS SAID THAT THEY WOULD BE NEGATIVELY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED IF THEY DON'T RECEIVE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM THE STATE. IMPACTS LIKE DIFFICULTY ATTRACTING AND RETAINING QUALITY. STAFF HAVING TO REDUCE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR STAFF HAVING TO REDUCE ACADEMIC SUPPORT AND ENRICHMENT ACTIVITIES FOR STUDENTS. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE AND THE SUPPORT THAT BILL THOSE PROTECTIVE AND RESILIENCY FACTORS THAT HELP PREVENT SUBSTANCE USE. KEEPS KIDS IN SCHOOL AND BOOST THEIR ACADEMIC SUCCESS AND WELL BEING. UNDER FUNDING ALSO REDUCES THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS SERVED IN OUR SURVEY NEARLY A FOURTH OF STATE PROGRAMS ARE VERY LIKELY TO CLOSE THEIR DOORS WITHIN THE NEXT TWO YEARS WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDING. AND AS IT IS OVER TWENTY NINE HUNDRED LOW INCOME SCHOOLS DON'T RECEIVE STATE OR FEDERAL FUNDING FOR THE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS SO FOR EXAMPLE ONE IN FOUR PROGRAMS THAT APPLIED FOR FEDERAL FUNDING LAST YEAR. DIDN'T RECEIVE ANY SO THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF DEMAND BUT THERE'S A SHORTAGE OF FUNDING SO WE PLEASE ASK THAT THE COMMITTEE VOTE I AND AB SEVENTEEN FORTY FOUR TO KEEP THE PROMISE. VOTERS THAT TAX REVENUE FROM PROP SIXTY FOUR GOES TO PROGRAMS THAT EFFECTIVELY SUPPORTS CHILDREN AND YOUTH AND PREVENT REDUCE SUBSTANCE USE IN COMMITTEES THAT BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY THE WAR ON CRIME.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN RESIDE IT'S BEEN A LONG HEARING AND SAID IT IS NOT THAT CLOSE TO TO BEING OVER SO I'M GONNA SKIP OVER OUR REMARKS I. I WAS GOING TO GIVE ABOUT. THE. THAT THE MAGNITUDE OF MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS IN CALIFORNIA THE GAPS THAT EXISTS IN ACCESS TO TREATMENT IN THE AYE REPORTS BY THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION THE STATE AUDITOR THAT HAVE. I HAVE DOCUMENTED A LOT OF THIS OF COURSE OF THEIR QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT WE CAN NOT CERTAINLY I I DELVE INTO ANY OF THOSE TOPICS NOT AS QUICKLY SUMMARIZE FOR YOU AT THIS BILL DOES TO ADDRESS THAT. ARE THE ISSUE I'M IN THIS BILL WOULD ADDRESS THESE ISSUES BY REQUIRING THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION TO DO THREE THINGS. FIRST DEVELOP A FISCAL PROGRAMMATIC AND HOW COME TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY STRATEGY FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT MENTAL HEALTH. I ASKED SECOND DEVELOP A FISCAL PROGRAMMATIC AN OUTCOME TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY STRATEGY FOR STATE GOVERNMENT MENTAL HEALTH. THIRD ASSESS THE ADEQUACY OF EXISTING STATUTORY AND REGULATORY DATA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS STRATEGIES AND PRACTICES AND THIS INCLUDES MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE FOR STREAMLINING AND STRAIGHTEN THOSE STRATEGIES. TO REDUCE COSTS AND IMPROVE THE USE OF INFORMATION TO GUIDE PROGRAM FISCAL AND RELATED DECISIONS I THE BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE. THE COMMISSION TO REPORT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE NO LATER THAN TWENTY TWENTY WHEN UPDATE ON THE PROGRESS OF THE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY STRATEGY. I RESPECT RESPECTFULLY ASK WE ARE AYE VOTE AND WITH ME TODAY TO OFFER THE DISCUSS THESE ISSUES IS TOBY EWING. WHO IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY? GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS TOBY DOING I'M THE EXECUTRIX OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION THE BILL WOULD GIVE THE COMMISSION EXPLICIT AUTHORITY TO TO BUILD THE STRATEGY. TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM IS TRANSPARENT AND ACCOUNTABLE IN TERMS OF THE DOLLARS THAT COUNTIES RECEIVE TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO FOLKS IN NEED THE TYPES OF SERVICES THAT ARE THERE. INCLUDING ENSURING THAT WE ADDRESS THAT THE RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES THAT ARE CHALLENGING ACROSS THE STATE. AND THEN THE THIRD PIECE IS THE OUTCOMES. THE THAT THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR TO CRAFT THIS ALTHOUGH THE COMMISSION MEETS THURSDAY TO TALK ABOUT THE BILL AND DOES NOT HAVE AN EXPLICIT SUPPORT POSITION WE'D APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR. TO STRENGTHEN THIS AND MAKE SURE IT'S ALIGNED WITH THAT THE BROAD GOALS THAT THE COMMISSION HAS IN OUR ABILITY TO ACTUALLY SUPPORT PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY IN TERMS THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. HAPPY TO RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. SEE NO IS THERE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. GOOD EVENING I'M MARRIED THERE WITH COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION THANK YOU FOR HEARING OUR COMMENTS TONIGHT WE HAVE IN OPPOSED POSITION ON THIS BILL. WE BELIEVE. IT'S DUPLICATIVE AND UNNECESSARY NUMEROUS OF THE DATA POINTS HAVE BEEN OUTLINED IN THIS STATUTE ARE CURRENTLY COLLECTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AND THE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. SO WE FEEL THE STATUTE DOESN'T REFLECT ALL THE GREAT WORK THAT IS BEING DONE. IN THE DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS AREA AND IN FACT WE HAVE A SEPARATE PROPOSAL TO EVALUATE THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT TO LEVERAGE ALL THAT DATA THAT IS CURRENTLY. COLLECTED IN FOR THESE REASONS WE OPPOSE THE SPELL. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITE. WE KNOW AND BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS. BEEN MOVED I. SUBS ARE WE HAVE. A MOTION AND A SECOND. I DO I DO YOU HAVE. SOME COMMENTS AND THEN I'LL ALLOW YOU TO CLOSE A SAID. YOU KNOW THE BILL WOULD SUBSTANTIALLY AMENDED AT THE LAST MINUTE. THE PREVIOUS VERSION THE BILL ESTABLISHED AN ENTIRELY NEW DEPARTMENT. FOUR OF THE OVERSIGHT OF MENTAL HEALTH FUNDS LAST WEEK AS AMENDED TO IN TWO INSTEAD ESTABLISH A STATUTE. O. INSTEAD YOU NUMEROUS NEW REQUIREMENTS ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN THE SPIRIT OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY SOMETHING THAT I FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT. BUT I WOULD I WOULD SAY THIS IS IT THIS WAS LAST WEEK A HUGE REWRITE OF THE BILL. WHILE THE COMMISSION IS ALREADY DOING MOST OF WHAT THE WORK AT THAT OF THAT THAT THIS BILL REQUIRES WE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ADEQUATE TIME TO HAVE THE STAKEHOLDER DISCUSSIONS. DE ACTUALLY SPEAK WITH THE STATE BECAUSE IT WOULD BE AFFECTED BY THE BILL. THAT'S THE REASON I DON'T HAVE A RECOMMENDATION ON THE ON THE BILL AT THIS POINT SO I'M LIKE. COMMITTEE MAY YOU KNOW HOWEVER THEY HAVEN'T USED TO VOTE THAT THAT'S. THAT'S THAT'S MY CONCERN. WITHOUT ALL OF THE WHAT YOU GO AHEAD AND CLOSE IF YOU LIKE MR KILEY. YES THINK MISTER CHAIR AND I APPRECIATE THAT I I WILL TELL YOU THAT THIS IS BEEN A TWO YEAR EFFORT FOR US I. IN TRYING TO. MOVE THE BALL FORWARD AYE WHEN IT COMES TO AN ISSUE THAT I THINK WE ALL I RECOGNIZE IN THAT'S BEEN RECOGNIZED WITH A LITTLE WHO HOOVER COMMISSION. I AND SEVERAL TIMES BY THE STATE AUDITOR INCLUDING AGAIN JUST A A COUPLE MONTHS AGO AND I IT'S TRUE THAT. WHEN WE FIRST SET OUT WE WERE DOING SOMETHING BROADER. BUT WE'VE BEEN MEETING WITH STAKEHOLDERS. OF OF ALL KINDS AYE THROUGHOUT THE LAST TWO YEARS AND OF REALLY I THINK CHISELED OUT AND AN AREA OF SOME CONSENSUS AND I UNDERSTAND THEIR CONCERNS AYE THAT I'LL I'LL GET TO THAT IN JUST A SECOND BUT I'M. WE ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION THAT PERHAPS THE BEST STEP WE COULD TAKE. WHEN IT COMES TO OUR BEING ABLE TO MORE EFFECTIVELY DELIVER MENTAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES WAS TO GET THE DATA AYE THAT TOBY AND HIS COMMISSION AND OUR LOCAL I. HEALTHCARE LEADERS NEED. IN ORDER TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS WORKING SO THAT WE CAN DO MORE OF IT SO THAT WE CAN REACH MORE PEOPLE. THAT WE CAN SAVE MORE LIVES IN TURN AROUND MORE LIVES AND I THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER AYE MEASURES GOING ON IN THE LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW THAT ARE IMPORTANT AND ARE SEEKING TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM AS WELL. I THINK THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT STEP. I'M AND WE'RE VERY MUCH I YOU KNOW I. OPEN AND WILLING TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS I WILL SAY THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS A CONCERN ABOUT. THEY'RE ALREADY BEING EXISTING REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ACTUALLY PART OF OUR BILL THIS IS IN. SUBSECTION SEE IS TO SUPPORT ENHANCE TRANSPARENCY OUTCOME ACCOUNTABILITY THE COMMISSION SO ASSESS THE ADEQUACY OF EXISTING STATUTORY REGULATORY DATA REPORTING REQUIREMENT STRATEGIES AND PRACTICES AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE FOR STREAMLINING. AND STRENGTHENING THOSE STRATEGIES TO REDUCE COSTS AND IMPROVE THE USE OF INFORMATION TO GUIDE PROGRAM FISCAL AND RELATED DECISIONS I THINK THE IMPACT OF THIS WON'T BE TO INCREASE ANY BURDENS ARE ON YOUR AND BUT RATHER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE AT THE DATA THAT WE'RE GETTING. IS IS WHAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS GOING FORWARD AYE SO I THANK VERY MUCH THE COMMITTEE FOR ITS COOPERATION AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR ABOUT. SO WE HAVE A MOTION.

SOME OF OUR WITNESSES HAD TO LEAVE TODAY BECAUSE A PET PLANE FLIGHT SO WE WILL BE A LOT BRIEFER THAN WE INTENDED TO BE. AB THIRTY THIRTY TWO WOULD REQUIRE HOSPITALS WITH A PRENATAL UNIT TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A QUALITY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM RELATING TO MATERIAL. OF MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH WHICH ALSO INCLUDES POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION. THIS BILL IS A MODEST STEP TOWARD ADDRESSING THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF OUR MOTHERS AND OUR CHILDREN. AB THIRTY THIRTY TWO AUGMENTS THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA'S OF MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH TASK FORCE. ONE IN FIVE OF NEW OR EXPECTANT MOTHERS WILL EXPERIENCING A MENTAL HEALTH DISORDER. DURING A PREGNANCY OR THE FIRST YEAR FOLLOWING CHILDBIRTH. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE BREAK THE STIGMA ATTACHED TO MH DISORDERS AND ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF NEW MOTHERS. FAR TO OFTEN NEW MOTHERS EXPERIENCING SEVERE DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY FEEL ASHAMED INADEQUATE. OR SCARED AND DO NOT SEEK THE CLINICAL ASSESSMENT TREATMENT THEY DESPERATELY NEED. MATERNAL DEPRESSION IS AN ECONOMIC BURDEN. ON THE UNITED STATES. THE COST OF UNTREATED DEPRESSION INCLUDE LOSS OF PRODUCTIVITY AND MEDICAL COSTS AND ALSO. UNTREATED MATERNAL MENTAL DEPRESSION NEGATIVELY IMPACTS EMPLOYMENT HOUSEHOLD INCOME BURNING THE PUBLIC ASSIST ASSISTANCE SYSTEM. AND THE WORST CASE MOTHERS AND FAMILY SUFFER THE MOST SIGNIFICANT COST. SUICIDE. MEMBERS I UNDERSTAND UNLESS YOU MOVE THERE ARE CONCERNS WITH THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM. HOWEVER I INTEND TO WORK CLOSELY WITH CH A. HE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS MEDICAL STAFF AND STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THAT THIS BILL PROVIDES ALL ENTITIES. WITH THE NECESSARY TOOLS TO SUPPORT NEW MOTHER STRUGGLING FROM MH DISORDERS. WITH ME TODAY'S CHOI BURKHART WITH TWENTY TWENTY MONTHS.

AND AND BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR DEVELOPING PROGRAMS FOR THESE WOMEN. AND I HAVE. ALL KINDS OF EXAMPLES OF HOW WOMEN FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS IN OUR OUTPATIENT MENTAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES MAKING THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE HOSPITAL'S CRITICAL TO REACH THESE WOMEN.

A BILL WHICH WOULD AUTHORIZE THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO APPROVE THE REQUIRED SIXTY HOURS OF CLASSROOM TRAINING. FOR CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANTS TO BE OFFERED THROUGH ONLINE OR DISTANCE LEARNING CLASSES. CALIFORNIA SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES ARE FACING A WORKFORCE SHORTAGE THROUGHOUT THE STATE WITH OVER FOURTEEN MILLION PEOPLE ON MEDI CAL AND ELEVEN HUNDRED CALIFORNIANS TURNING SIXTY FIVE. YEARS OLD EVERY DAY THEY MUST BE AND THAT. THERE MUST BE AN ATTRACTIVE AND SUSTAINABLE WORKFORCE SOMEPLACE. IN ORDER TO CARE FOR AGING POPULATION THIS BILL WILL HELP ADDRESS CALIFORNIA SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES WORKFORCE SHORTAGE BY MODERNIZING THE CLASSROOM TRAINING REQUIREMENT TO BECOME A CNA. I GIVEN THAT THAT. THE CONVENIENCE OF IT AND EFFICIENCY OF ONLINE COURSEWORK ALLOWING POTENTIAL CMA'S THE OPTION OF PURSUING THIS PORTION OF THEIR CERTIFICATION ONLINE IS A COMMON SENSE APPROACH. TOWARDS MODERNIZING THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS AND ENCOURAGING MORE PEOPLE TO GET INTO THE FIELD. WITH ME TODAY I HAVE JENNIFER SNYDER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH OF FACILITIES THE SPONSOR OF THIS LEGISLATION. JENNIFER CIDER ON BEHALF RECOVERY ASSOCIATION HOPE FACILITIES WE APPRECIATE THAT SOME OF HER RUBIO AND HANDLING THIS ARE BUILT THIS BILL FOR US THIS YEAR. WE AS MANY OF YOU KNOW.

AND WE ESTIMATE THAT AT LEAST TO A SEVENTEEN HUNDRED NEW CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANTS WILL BE REQUIRED TO SUPPLY AND THAT NEED TO BE AND. OUR FACILITIES ARE EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT WHERE THOSE SEE AN AIDS ARE GOING TO COME FROM OF THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY ONE WAY FOR MANY OF OUR FACILITIES TO GET A LITTLE BIT MORE CREATIVE WITH THEIR TRAINING PROGRAMS. AND PROVIDE BETTER ACCESS TO INDIVIDUALS FOR ONLINE AND DISTANCE LEARNING. TO GET THEIR TRAINING DONE THROUGH. DIFFERENTMEANS AND THERE ARE MANY OTHER STATES THAT PROVIDE ONLINE TRAINING FOR CNN IS THERE ARE ALSO MANY OTHER HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS THAT USE ONLINE OR DISTANCE LEARNING. ARE RIGHT NOW THAT PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH DOES NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO THIS AT LEAST NOW THEY WILL HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO APPROVE I'M SOME OF OUR TRAINING PROGRAMS.

AND JUST BRIEFLY ONE I THINK ASSEMBLYMEMBERS BURKE AND LODGING FOR AUTHORING THIS IMPORTANT DEL. OVARIAN CANCER IS ONE OF THE DEADLIEST OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCERS THAT CAN HAPPEN TO ANYONE AT ANY AGE AND PART OF THE REASON FOR THE HIGH MORTALITY RATES IS THAT DETECTION OFTEN COMES TOO LATE. THE CITY OF LA WAS INSPIRED TO SPONSOR THIS BILL BY THE OVARIAN CANCER CIRCLE AND THE STORY OF ROBIN BABY WHO LOST HER FIGHT WITH OVARIAN CANCER AT ONLY TWENTY YEARS OLD. MADE BY ROBIN STORY THE LOS ANGELES CITY COUNCIL HELD A SPECIAL PRESENTATION IN SEPTEMBER FOR OVARIAN CANCER AWARENESS MONTH.

TWELVE ZERO YOUR BILL IS OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR WHEN. AS IRWIN YOU HAVE AB TWENTY SIX FORTY THREE. AB TWENTY SIX FORTY THREE EXPANDS HEALTH CARE COVERAGE OF GENERAL ANESTHESIA TO THE DENTAL OFFICE SETTING FOR CERTAIN POPULATIONS CHILDREN UNDER SEVEN. PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. WHEN ANESTHESIA IS MEDICALLY NECESSARY FOR DENTAL SERVICES THE BILL ALSO AMENDS REQUIRED INFORMATION INFORMED CONSENT TO INCLUDE A REFERENCE TO NON SURGICAL TREATMENT OPTIONS. I DENTAL CAVITIES ARE THE MOST CHRONIC. CHILDHOOD DISEASE AFFECTING NEARLY TWO THIRDS OF AMERICAN CHILDREN BY. GRADE THREE PAIN AND INFECTION RELATED TO CABBIES RESULTS IN A LOSS OF FIFTY ONE MILLION SCHOOL HOURS EACH YEAR. WHEN TREATMENT IS NEEDED TO ADDRESS CAVITIES IN YOUNG CHILDREN OF PEOPLE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS THOSE UNABLE TO. COOPERATE WITH TRADITIONAL DENTAL TREATMENT GENERAL ANESTHESIA IS OFTEN THE ONLY OPTION FOR. SITE I HAD THE PROVISION OF THE CARE. OF ONE THIS IS THE CASE DENNIS HAVE THREE OPTIONS HOSPITAL AMBULATORY SURGERY CENTER AND THE DENTAL OFFICE AND RIGHT NOW INSURANCE IS NOT COVER THAT OUR OFFICE SO. I WOULD LAST A FEW OF OUR WITNESSES BUT I'M SURE YOU'RE VERY HAPPY ABOUT THAT. GOOD GOOD EVENING CHAIR MEMBERS. BREANNA PITTMAN SPONSOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION I AM PLEASED TO BE THE CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. DOCTOR POWERS ORDER. GRIZZARD OF PEDIATRIC DENNIS WHOSE ARE A CO SPONSOR WAS HERE AND JUST HAD TO LEAVE TO CATCH FLIGHT. SO EGGS AT EXISTING LAW REQUIRES THAT MEDICAL PLANS COVER THE COST OF GENERAL ANESTHESIA. IN SPECIFIC VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WHICH WERE JUST DESCRIBED. BUT IT REQUIRES OF THE STREET IN THE CAR AND HOSPITAL OR SURGERIES CENTER. THIS COVERAGE OR CRIME AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE REASON FOR ANESTHESIA IS NOT THE DEVIL TREATMENT ITSELF BUT IS. TO UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION OR AGE OF THE PATIENT A HEALTHY AND ADULT FOR EXAMPLE WOULD BE ABLE TO SIT THROUGH A DENTAL TREATMENT TO RECEIVE MULTIPLE FILLINGS OR CROWNS WALL SOME OF THESE POPULATIONS JUST AREN'T ABLE TO. REMOVING THE SETTING RESTRICTION ON EXISTING COVERAGE WILL REMOVE THE COST BARRIERS FOR SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS ENSURING TIMELY ACCESS CAN BE PROVIDED IN THE LEAST DRAMATIC SETTING. AND WHAT THE LOWEST COST BURDEN FOR FAMILIES. I'M CDA IS TRYING TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO DENTAL SEDATION ANASTASIA BORE ALSO COMMITTED TO DECREASING THE NEED WHEREVER POSSIBLE. AND THE CHANGE IN THE INFORMED CONSENT THAT WAS MENTIONED. IS REALLY INTENDED TO MAKE SURE THAT FAMILIES OF MINORS ARE. INFORMED OF THE ALTERNATIVES AND IT'S REALLY JUST CONTINUATION OF OUR EFFORTS THERE SOBRE DIVING FLUORIDE IS A NEW TREATMENT THAT'S AVAILABLE IT CAN ACTUALLY IT'S A MEDIC IN THE DOCUMENT THE PONTIFF CAN. SLOW OR STOP. THE DEVELOPMENT OF CAVITIES AND SO CAN BE A REALLY GOOD ALTERNATIVE FOR SOME OF THESE POPULATIONS TO INSTEAD OF HAVING THEM UNDERGO ANESTHESIA JUST FOR SIMPLE CLEANING OR SOME THINGS. TO REALLY TRY TO PROMOTE THAT AND WE THINK THAT THE INFORMED CONSENT IS A SMALL PIECE ABOUT SO. THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME TALK ON AN URGENT AYE VOTE. OTHERS IN SUPPORT HOW MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS BREAK STOCKARD IN BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF ANESTHESIOLOGISTS AND. DELIGHTED TO FINALLY BE ABLE TO SUPPORT A CDA SPONSORED PEDIATRIC DENTAL HONESTY SHOULDN'T THANKS VERY MUCH. IF. OTHERS IN SUPPORT OF ANYONE ELSE. ANGELA LANTERN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION ANDERSON ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT. YOU VERY MUCH. IS THERE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION ROOM WELL HELLO AGAIN JENNIFER OUT WITH CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS IDEA WE REPRESENT FORTY EIGHT PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS THAT COLLECT. COLLECTIVELY PROVIDE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE TWENTY SIX MILLION CALIFORNIA. WE OPPOSE AB TWENTY SIX FORTY THREE A BILL THAT CREATES A COSTLY NEW MANDATE. A REQUIRED HEALTH PLANS TO COVER ANASTASIA SERVICES AND AN OFFICE. ASK THE PROPONENTS OF ALREADY STATED HEALTH PLANS CURRENTLY COVER ANASTASIA FOR DENTAL SERVICES WHAT IS PROVIDED IN A HOSPITAL OR OUTPATIENT SETTING. AND IT SOME OF THOSE OF COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS IS THAT THAT FACILITY BEING CONTRACT WITH THE HEALTH PLAN. AND SO WHAT THIS MANDATE DOES IT MOVES IT'S OUTSIDE OF. HEALTH INJURED CONTRACTED ENTITIES AND MOVES INTO OUR NETWORK NON CONTRACTED DENTAL OFFICES WHICH MAY CREATE REIMBURSEMENT ISSUES ON THE BACK END FOR THIS BILL. YOU KNOW WE'VE HEAD A LOT ABOUT HEALTHCARE COSTS RIGHT THIS IS AN EXPENSIVE MANDATE ITS MOST EXPENSIVE MANDATE THAT WE FOR ABOUT. IN THE COMMITTEE TODAY. NO PREMIUM INCREASE IN THE TO BURKE RECORD A SEVENTY FIVE MILLION OVERALL TOTAL COSTS THE SYSTEM IS A UPPER TO FORTY MILLION SAVED IN THE ANNOUNCERS. AND THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY. YOU KNOW MY MEMBERS REALLY TRY TO KEEP PREMIUMS AFFORDABLE TO ENSURE THE VIBRANT SUCCESS THAT WE HAVE. WITH NINETY THREE PERCENT OF OF CALIFORNIANS CURRENTLY COVERED BY HEALTH INSURANCE IN ITS MANDATES LIKE THIS. TO JEOPARDIZE OUR ABILITY TO KEEP. HEALTH PREMIUMS AFFORDABLE. THANK YOU. CHAIR MEMBERS KATHY MOSSBERG RIPS INTO LOCAL HEALTH PLANS CALIFORNIA THE SIXTEEN NOT FOR PROFIT MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS OUR CONCERNS ARE SIMILAR BUT JUST TO BE CLEAR THE ISSUE OF NON CONTRACTING PROVIDERS IS A BIG ONE FOR US. WHEN THERE IS A CONTRACTING PROVIDER WE CREDENTIALED AND WE LOOK AT QUALIFICATIONS WOULD LOOK AT FACILITIES AND CHECK THEM FOR SAFETY. THAT WOULD BECAUSE THESE ARE NOT CONTRACTING WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO THAT ARE HAPPY DOING THAT SO WE DO A LOT OF CONCERNS FOR THIS AS AS. AS WE SEE THIS IN PLAY SO UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE POSED THIS TIME. OPPOSITE. YEAH I JOHN LINGER ON BEHALF AMERICA'S HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS WE LINE OUR COMMENTS OF VILLAGE PC AND CAP. ANYONE ELSE. IT'S YOU KNOW AND I'M OF COURSE ISN'T A RUNAWAY PLEASE YOU DON'T MIND. NO YOU YEP KNOW EITHER ONE OF YOU DOESN'T MATTER. OH MAYBE BOTH OF YOU. DOES ANYBODY ELSE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. MR RESTRAINTS. YEAH I'M NOT SURE I CAN SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY BUT I LIKE IT. AND THE REASON I LIKE IT IS BECAUSE. I DO THINK THERE'S GOTTA BE MORE IN A. DENTISTRY AND AND MEDICINE. THIS FALL. I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY ABLE TO HEAR ABOUT WHAT MINNESOTA'S DOING AND HEARING ABOUT HOW THEY'RE ACTUALLY LOWERING COSTS. A BECAUSE OF. THEIR INTEGRATED NAM. SERVICE BETWEEN BED DENTISTRY IN MEDICINE AND I THINK THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I DON'T LIKE THE COSTUMES THAT WOULD NOT THE WAY THE SYSTEM. IS SET UP BUT I LIKE THE DIRECTIONS. AND IF YOU WANTED TO. YOU KNOW. TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT BUT AND MARK OR NOT WAS TO QUESTIONS MORE A STATEMENT BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE INTEGRATION. WELL I THINK THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS INTEGRATED RIGHT BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO THE HOSPITAL THEY'RE GOING TO THE OUT PATIENT SURGERY THEY'RE GOING TO A MEDICAL FACILITY FOR THIS TREATMENT AND WHAT THIS DOES KIND OF. FROM WHAT I HEARD YOUR COMMENTS IS THIS KIND D. INTEGRATES IT RIGHT IT'S POINTED OUT OF THE HEALTH AND MOVING ITS WHOLLY INTO THE DENTAL. BUT IT'S A LATE HOUR I'M SURE AND ARTICULATE VERY WELL. WILL COME BACK AND HAVE SOME MORE CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS ABOUT THAT. TO ANYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD QUESTION. YES MY QUESTION MY QUESTION IS. AS A DENTIST AND AND. IT'S ALREADY ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET GENERAL ANESTHESIA COVERAGE FOR A CHILD IN THE HOSPITAL SETTING. IT JUST ISN'T APPROVED VERY OFTEN. THAT IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE SETTING. TO PROVIDE CARE. ABSOLUTE MOST EXPENSIVE SO THE DENTAL OFFICE. IN THE RIGHT SET YOU UP WITH THE RIGHT SUPERVISION WITH THE RIGHT. PRECAUTIONS IS THE LEAST EXPENSIVE SETTING. SO YOU'RE YOU'RE YOUR YOUR CONTENTION ABOUT NOT WANTING THIS BILL IS BECAUSE IT WAS BECAUSE OF. NOT NON CONTRACTING PROVIDERS. WHY WOULDN'T YOU WANT A CONTRACT WHAT COULD YOU WHICH PROHIBIT YOU FROM CONTRACTING WITH PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE THIS SERVICE? TO HELP THESE KIDS AND TO HELP THESE PEOPLE IN VULNERABLE POPULATIONS TO GET THE CARE THEY NEED. IN A VERY INEXPENSIVE SETTING CHUCK JUST I WOULD JUST SPEAK TO THE MEDI CAL SYSTEM IN MEDI CAL AT THE DENTAL IS GENERALLY A CARVED OUT. A CARVED OUT ISSUE SO. WE CERTAINLY HAVE PLANS LOOKING AT TRYING TO LOOK AT A CARVIN SITUATION WHERE I THINK THAT WOULD SOLVE IT BUT I THINK THAT'S OUR ISSUE. WHEN YOU DO IT IN THOSE FACILITIES WE DO COVER IT AND SO WE HAVE CREDENTIALS FACILITIES AND LOOKED AT IT BUT I THINK THE MEDI CAL ISSUES BECAUSE IT'S CARVED OUT. AND THE AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR. PRIVATE SECTOR NOT ALL OF OUR OUR COMMERCIAL PLANTS CURRENTLY YOU DON'T. INCLUDE A DENTAL BENEFIT SOME DO SOME DON'T SOME HAVE EMBEDDED AND SOME DO NOT. AND SO. YOU KNOW WHEN WE CONTRACT WITH A PROVIDED PROVIDER IS MISS MUSBURGER STATED THERE IS A CREDENTIALING PROCESS THAT THEY GO THROUGH AND SO. TO JUST HAVE A BLANKET BENEFIT THAT SAYS YOU DON'T OWE YOU CAN HAVE IT IN IN THE DENTAL OFFICE IN YOUR HEALTH PLANS GOING TO COVER THAT. THAT'S THAT'S AN ONE IN INCREASED COSTS FOR US BECAUSE WE THINK UTILIZATION IS GONNA GO OUT. BUT TO WE DON'T. WE MAY NOT HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THOSE PROVIDERS. AND SO THEN THAT PUTS PRESSURE YOU KNOW ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ON THE PLANS OF WE HAVE TO GO OUT AND AND CONTRACT WITH A SLEW OF NEW PROVIDERS TO COVER THIS MANDATE. THAT IT'S GONNA BUMP UP ON OUR NETWORK ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS THAT WE HAVE WITH OUR REGULATORS. SO YOU DO YOU YOU YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO CONTRACT WITH ADDITIONAL PROVIDERS. DO I DON'T THINK IT'S A MATTER THAT WE DON'T WANT TO I MEAN IT'S JUST. YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S GOOD WE WERE COMPLETELY HAVE THERE'S THE POTENTIAL THAT WILL HAVE TO COMPLETELY RETOOL RE TUNE THE RETOOL A RETURNON THE EXISTING. NETWORK TO ENSURE THAT THESE PROVIDERS ARE CONTRACTED WHEN WERE ALREADY COVERING THE SERVICE IN A DIFFERENT SETTING THE MOST EXPENSIVE SETTING YOU COULD POSSIBLY COVERED AND. THAT AND THAT'S MY POINT AND THAT'S AND I APPRECIATE MR MAZES OF COMMENT TO ABOUT. HOW CAN WE GET TO A POINT WE CAN INTEGRATE A DENTISTRY IN MEDICINE MORE FOR SITUATIONS JUST LIKE THIS BECAUSE I APPRECIATE? YOU DO HAVE A SETTINGS YOU CAN DO IT BUT IT IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE WAY TO DO IT. AND HERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE AND YES OR MAYBE ADDITIONAL COSTS BUT. FOR THE PEOPLE THE NEEDS OF THIS POPULATION. THE SEDATION IS NOT A DENTAL ISSUE IT'S A MEDICAL ISSUE THEY CANNOT HAVE THE CARE WITHOUT SOME MEDICAL INTERVENTION. THAT'S THE ISSUE HERE AND SO THAT'S WHERE THE INTEGRATION IS MISSING. AND IT IS A LEUPOLD SALUTE POLYGONAL WHERE FOR THIRTY YEARS AND I WISH YOU WOULD CHANGE BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY WAS A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT GETTING THE CARE THEY NEED. WHICH LEADS TO OTHER KINDS OF PROBLEMS DOWN THE ROAD AND. I JUST WISH. WE COULD BE WORKING TOWARDS SOLUTION INSTEAD OF JUST SAYING NOW IT'S JUST ANOTHER MANDATE. SO ANYWAY. IT'S LAKE. THIS SHORT SOAPBOX BUT YOU KNOW IT IS AN ISSUE THAT I'VE WATCHED FOR THIRTY YEARS AND. AND PEOPLE DON'T GET THE CARE THEY NEED BECAUSE OF THIS. THIS WHOLE RIGHT HERE. AND YET YOU'RE WILLING TO PAY FOR IN THE MOST EXPENSIVE SETTING OCCASIONALLY. NOT VERY OFF IT'S VERY RARE THAT I ACTUALLY HEAR ABOUT THESE CASES ACTUALLY BECAUSE NUMBER ONE. THERE AREN'T THE FACILITIES AVAILABLE. AND HOSPITALS DON'T WANT TO GIVE UP THEIR OR SWEETS IN GENERAL FOR FOR THESE PROCEDURES BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT. VERY. PROFITABLE. AND AND THERE'S JUST A LOT THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUE THE LOT OF ISSUES HERE SO IT IS EASIER TO IS TO NOT CONTRACT IT OR TO NOT. COVER IT AND AND MEANWHILE. PEOPLE DON'T GET THE SERVICES THEY NEED THE CARE THEY NEED. ANYWAY. WHICH I COULDN'T BUT I THINK WE JUST CLOSE FOR ME. BUT. I I WOULD SAY IT'S NOT ONLY THAT THAT AND AND OFFICE CAN PROVIDED AT A MUCH LOWER COST BUT IT'S ALSO A MUCH LESS DRAMATIC SETTING FOR THESE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS SO. WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR DISTRIBUTOR AMENDMENTS. I'M SORRY DID YOU TO FURTHER DOWN. THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT SO WE HAVE A MOTION BY MISTER THURMOND A SECOND BY MISS LIMON.

SHE BOB VERY VERY HARD WHILE WORKING FULL TIME IN HELPING MY FATHER RAISED MY BROTHER AND I. MY MOM WENT IN APRIL TWO THOUSAND TWELVE HER FIVE YEAR. HER FIFTH YEAR IN REMISSION THAT THE CANCER HAD RECURRED. LUCKILY SHE WAS ABLE TO SEE THE BONE ACTION. IT'S LIKELY SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE THE BILL PASSED BUT SHE WAS UNABLE TO EXPERIENCE AND SEE THE BONE ACTION. SHE PASSED AWAY EARLY TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. I NEVER REALIZED TALKS WITH MY MOM'S TREATMENTS ACTUALLY WHERE UNTIL SHE PASS. OF COURSE MY PARENTS NEVER TALKED ABOUT FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS MY BROTHER AND I WE WERE YOUNG. MY PARENTS ALWAYS MADE SURE WE HAD CLOTHES ON OUR BACK WE HAD THE FOOD WE HAD A ROOF OVER OUR HEADS. BUT I NEVER REALIZED THE MAGNITUDE OF BILLS THAT WERE PILING UP IN THE FINANCIAL HARDSHIP YOU'RE ACTUALLY IN. A LOT OF PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY WOULD BRING MEALS FOR US EVERY WEEK YOU'D GET ANONYMOUS SPONSORS SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE ON OUR EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES. I WE THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE MY MOM WAS SICK WHICH IT WAS BUT IT WAS ALSO BECAUSE WE'RE IN SUCH A FINANCIAL HARDSHIP. THIS MEDICATION THAT POTENTIALLY COULD SAVE MY MOM'S LIFE WAS BREAKING MY PANTS POCKETS. I REMEMBER MY FATHER SHOWING ONE OF HER ORAL CHEMOTHERAPY MEDICATIONS THE SMALL BOTTLE CONTAINING ONLY THIRTY PILLS BECAUSE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE DOLLARS AND FORTY TWO CENTS. ALL THESE DIFFERENT MEDICATIONS WERE CAUSING MY PANTS THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. ONE DAY I WAS HOPING MY FATHER SORT THROUGH ALL THE BILLS. WE LEARNED THAT MY MOM WAS SIGNING UP FOR EVERY CREDIT CARD SHE RECEIVED IN THE MAIL. JUST SO SHE COULD PAY FOR THESE MEDICATIONS. MY DAD TOLD ME THERE WERE TIMES THAT THEY STRUGGLE TO PAY FOR HOME AND THEN MY MOM'S PARENTS WOULD HELP OUT WITH THE MORTGAGE FROM TIME TO TIME. THESE MEDICATIONS WERE SO EXPENSIVE TO CONTINUE AND AFTER FIGHTING FOR SEVEN YEARS MY MOM DECIDED SHE WAS TOO TIRED.

AND ALSO THE FINANCIAL ASPECT OF IT. NO ONE DESERVES THE HARDSHIPS OCCURS ALONG WITH THAT MENTALLY PHYSICALLY AND FINANCIALLY. I HOPE YOU WILL COME SOONER AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY EVER SUCH U. HAS PAST I CAN'T HELP BUT WHAT THE. BUT WHAT IF ONE OF THESE MEDICATIONS THAT WE CANNOT AFFORD SAVED HER LIFE.

PLEASE WELL I FOR AB EATEN SIXTEEN. THANK YOU. UP MOST OF YOU HAVE HEARD. SOME ON BEING CALLED A BREAST CANCER SURVIVOR AYE I PERSONALLY CALL MYSELF A CANCER LIFE FOR SOMEONE THAT LIVES WOULD AND FIGHTS CANCER ON A DAILY BASIS. MY NAME IS A DIVA BARNEY AND THIS IS A VERY SHORT SHORT SHORT VERSION OF MY STORY. A TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE I WAS TWENTY SEVEN YEARS OLD. AND I WAS CLIMBING THE LADDER MY CAREER IN SWEDEN. HAPPILY MARRIED AND WAS JUST ABOUT TO HAVE A CHILD. OUT WHEN WE FOUND A LUMP IN MY LEFT BREAST. A LUMP THAT TURNED OUT TO BE STAGE ONE CANCER. STAGE ONE WAS FINE I GOT TREATED AND LIFE WAS GOING ON JUST A FEW MONTHS OF TREATMENTS AND I WAS. I WAS LIVING LIFE AGAIN. TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT HOURS NOW THIRTY YEARS OLD DIVORCED WITH NO KIDS. AND SO I DECIDED I WILL FACILITATE REAM OF MINE TO GO AND WORK IN THE U. S.. THAT IT'S BEEN ON MY BUCKET LIST. UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE TO DO A OR THAT WAS FORTUNATE BECAUSE I HAD% TO DO A FULL BODY HEALTH CHECK FOR THE INSURANCE. I AND THAT'S WHEN THEY FOUND TWO NEW TUMORS AYE IN MY BROTHER AND MY PREVIOUSLY TREATED BREAST. SO MY BREAST CANCER HAD COME BACK BUT STILL STAGE ONE HOWEVER I HAVE TO DO THE TOUGHEST TREATMENTS OUT WHICH INCLUDED IV CHEMO CARE. I BECAME A CARE WAS REALLY HORRIFIC AND. ANYTHING YOU CAN IMAGINE AND SIDE EFFECTS I HAD. WHILE I WAS STE A DEALING WITH THE SIDE EFFECTS I ACTUALLY PUT TOGETHER MY SECOND COMPANY AND THAT WAS THE COMPANY THAT TOOK ME LATER ON IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN TO THE AND UNITED STATES. OUGHT TO SILICON VALLEY TO FULFILL MY DREAM. FAST FORWARD TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN HOURS NOW A THIRTY SEVEN YEAR OLD BAD A CEO. AND HAPPILY MARRIED FOR TWO YEARS WITH A WONDERFUL MAN NAMED CHRIS. AGAIN I WANTTO START A FAMILY AN IVF WAS MY ONLY OPTION. THE FERTILITY CLINIC WANTED TO DO A MAMMOGRAM. YES AGAIN TURNED OUT I HAD BREAST CANCER AGAIN HOWEVER IN MY OTHER BREAST. AND THAT WAS OKAY BECAUSE IT WAS SUPER EARLY STAGE SO MASTECTOMY AND IT WOULD BE ALL GONE. HOWEVER WHEN I RECOVERED FROM THEM MY SURGERY I HAD A CT SCAN AS AN ANTI E. R. VISIT AND TURNED OUT THAT MY PREVIOUS BREAST CANCER HAS SPREAD THROUGHOUT MY BODY AND IT WAS IN SEVERAL SPOTS IN MY SPINE. MY LIFE CHANGED FOREVER AGAIN BUT THIS TIME I WAS FACED WITH MORTALITY I SUDDENLY HAD A BREAST CANCER DIAGNOSIS THAT WILL EVENTUALLY KILL ME. THEY GAVE ME THREE TO FIVE YEARS THAT WAS THREE YEARS AGO. AND I HAVE TO BE IN TREATMENT FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. THEY PUT ME ON SEVERAL DIFFERENT TREATMENTS BUT THEY ENDED UP NOT WORKING LONG TERM AND MY CANCER HAD NOW ALSO SPREAD TO MY LUNGS. I ALSO HAD A NEW TYPE OF RADIOSURGERY OUT THAT BLASTED THE BIGGEST HUMOR'S I HAD IN MY SPINE BUT PUT ME IN A WHEELCHAIR. WHERE I WAS FOR ABOUT A YEAR? I HAD TO FIGHT MY BACK TO MOVEMENT AGAIN. IN THE SUMMER OF TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SOMETHING WONDERFUL HAPPENED. I WAS PUT ON IN U. ORAL CHEMO TREATMENTS. A TREATMENT THAT HAS BEEN WORKING FLAWLESSLY FOR TWENTY NINE MONTHS I'M WALKING AGAIN I HAVE A GREAT LIFE. TREATMENT THAT MADE ME TO MORE FREE. I NOW HAVE A TEN TO FIFTEEN YEAR LIFE PROGNOSIS. AND SOMEWHAT GOOD QUALITY OF LIFE. SPIKE LIVING WITH CANCER IN ITS SIDE EFFECTS I HAVE AN ABSOLUTELY GREAT LIFE I TRAVEL A LOT ENJOY FOR. TIME WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS CHALLENGE MYSELF WITH A LOT OF NEW THINGS EVERY NEW YEAR. I AM I ALSO TAKE ON BOARD RULES AND.

ME AND MY HUSBAND DECIDED TO FULFILL OUR DREAM OF HAVING A FAMILY SO ARE. WE HAD DECIDED TO USE A SURROGATE OUR SURROGATE IS TODAY THIRTEEN TODAY ACTUALLY THIRTEEN WEEKS PREGNANT WITH OUR SON SO WE ARE OVER THE MOON. SO WHY AM I TELLING YOU ALL THIS WELL I AM ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES I GOT THE BEST TREATMENT YOU CAN IMAGINE. I GOT THE NEW GROUNDBREAKING ORAL CHEMO TREATMENT THAT WAS OUT IN THE MARKET HOLD NEAR TREATMENTS I TAKE ONE PILL. EVERY DAY FOR TWENTY ONE DAYS AND HAVE A SEVEN DAY BREAK AND THEN I'M ON IT AGAIN. ONE OF THESE PILLS COST FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT'S TEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. IF MY INSURANCE DIDN'T COVER IT I WOULD BE OUT ON THE STREET. NOT EVERYONE IS AS LUCKY AS I AM I PERSONALLY KNOW TWO YOUNG WOMEN IN MY SUPPORT GROUP. THAT ARE. ALSO SUPPOSED TO BE ON THE SCRUB GROUNDBREAKING TREATMENT THEY HAVE THE EXACT SAME TYPE OF A CANCER IN TUMOR TYPES THAT I HAD. BUT THEY'RE UNDER INSURERS INSURED AND CAN THEREFORE NOT AFFORD IT. THEY STILL TRY TO TAKE IT THOUGH EVERY TIME WE MEET. SCRAMBLE ALL THE PILLS THAT THE OTHER PATIENTS THE OTHERS MET SISTERS IN THE GROUP HAVE LAUGHED. SO SOMETIMES THEY TAKE FIVE PILLS A MONTH AND THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. SO UNFORTUNATELY THEIR CANCER HOSPITAL GRASSED. AND NOW THEY HAVE TO BE ON MORE TOXIC TREATMENTS WED LESS EFFECTIVE AT TREATMENTS WITH MORE TOXIC. AND THEY ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES PATIENTS ARE DYING BECAUSE THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO NEW LIFE CHANGING ORAL TREATMENTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TODAY. WE REALLY NEED BILL A. B. EIGHTEEN SIXTY.

KIMBERLY BEARDEN I'M A BREAST CANCER SURVIVOR AND A DEAR FRIEND OF BRENDA. FLOWERS. I AM IN FULL SUPPORT. OVERALL GREAT CALIFORNIA LIFE SCIENCES ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. WHERE TOP ON BEHALF OF VIACOM IN SUPPORT? ANNOUNCES IT ANYONE ENOUGH POSITION. PLUS I'M JENNIFER HOLLYWOOD CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS. YOU KNOW WE HAVE A OPPOSE POSITION ON AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY. ON WE DON'T WISH Y. CLARIFY HEALTH PLANS CURRENTLY COVER OR ORDERLY ADMINISTRATED. FORMERLY ADMINISTRATOR SO TIRED ANTI CANCER DRUGS BECAUSE THEY ARE IMPORTANT TOOLS. TO FIGHT AGAINST CANCER. OVER WE OPPOSE THIS BILL. BECAUSE IT LEGISLATIVELY SETS THE. PER PRESCRIPTION COPAYMENT OF FOR THESE EXPENSIVE DRUGS AT TWO HUNDRED WHICH IS LESS THAN THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLAR PRICE CAP FOR ALL OTHER OUTPATIENT DRUGS. I'M JUST LITTLE HISTORY THIS CAP WAS SEVEN WAS THE FIRST. PRESCRIPTION DRUG CAP THAT WAS SET INTO TO THE LEGISLATURE INTO STATUTE AND SINCE THEN THERE'S BEEN A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLAR PER PRESCRIPTION COST CAP. FOR ALL OTHER OUTPATIENT DRUGS AND SO WE WOULD LIKE. YOU KNOW THE SHERIFF COST FOR AN OF THESE TYPE OF MEDICATIONS TO FIT THE RUBRIC THAT ALL OTHER DRUG OUTPATIENT DRUGS I ADHERE TO. YOU KNOW WE UNDER. YOU NO UNDER CURRENT LAW HEALTH PLANS YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO. IMPLEMENT THAT COST CARE CAP FOR ANTI CANCER DRUGS WAS DIFFERENT FROM ALL OTHER OUTPATIENT PRINT PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IN THIS IS ADMINISTRATIVELY BURDENSOME. WHEN THEIR PRESCRIPTION DRUG CAPS IN PLACE NOT IN STATUTE. YOU KNOW KIND OF INSULATES THE CONSUMER FROM THE ACTUAL COST OF THOSE DRUGS AND HELPS THEM ACCESS THEM WITH THE SAME TIME THE HEALTH PLANS HAVE TO ABSORB THE. EXTREMELY HIGH COSTS FOR ALL THESE DRUGS WHICH GET SOCIALIZED OUT ON THE PREMIUM AND THAT'S THE DIRECTION OF THE APPROACH THAT WE'VE CHOSEN TO TAKE. WHO WERE SAYING AS WE'D LIKE THIS DRUG TO FALL UNDER THE RUBRIC WITH ALL THE RAP DISTRICTS THINK? ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. CNN WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ANYONE. MISS KOREA THINK YOU KNOW I LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS TO OTHERS COMMITTEE. I AM THE KNEES OF OF. MY AUNT WHO HAD A DOUBLE MASTECTOMY AND DIED OF BREAST CANCER. TO MY AUNTS HAVE HAD ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENTS UPSWINGS. AND LIKELY THERE. THEIR HEALTH IS OKAY. AND I THINK THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY CRITICAL CRITICAL. MEASURE TO THINK ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE HEALTH. AND WELFARE OF CALIFORNIANS ACROSS OUR STATES I THINK YOU. ANYONE ELSE ESTIMATES. DID A MUCH OF I HEARD YOU CORRECTLY WAS A ROOM. FOR. FTA HEALTH PLANS FOR AN AMENDMENT THAT WOULD GET YOU HAS THIRTY TWO TO BE SUPPORTIVE FOR NOW. SOME SOME OF THE OTHER HEALTH PLANS SO SHE ASIANS HAVE AN OPPOSING WAS A MINUTE POSITION ON IT AND THEY'VE LIKE THAT I BELIEVE THERE ASK IS THAT THE COST. DESCRIPTION COST CAP HE SAID IT TO FIFTY SO MIR'S WHAT'S IN PLACE FOR ALL OTHER OUTPATIENT DRUGS. BIGELOW. SO IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S SOME ROOM FOR AGREEMENT HERE. AND MOVEMENT. THERE'S TWO COURSES. THE PLANS CAN MOVE TO THE TWO FIFTY. AND MAYBE WORK WITH YOU AND HAVE. SOME SOLIDARITY ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. LAKE SECOND COURSES. WE REDUCE EVERYTHING TO TWO HUNDRED. AND MAKE IT ACROSS THE BOARD. WHAT CHOICE? OF THOSE TWO WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE. AS AN OPPORTUNITY SO I A ACTUALLY WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY THAT THERE IS A PRICE INDEX INCLUDED IN THIS AND SO. I'M GONNA HAVE. WITH. A LOT OF THE TO THIS PLACE. I THINK IT SO WHEN THIS BILL WAS PASSED FIVE YEARS AGO. IT WAS A HARD NEGOTIATION AND WE DID AND OF HAVING A CPI INDEX ADDED TO THE BILL. AND IT HAS NOT BEEN UTILIZED BY THE HEALTH PLANS. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CPI FOR THE. MEDICAL PRICE INDEX UNDER THAT COMES IN THE E. CATEGORIES. AND YOU AVERAGE A COSTS THEY COULD OF BEEN IT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY DOLLARS AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE OVER THE YEARS AS THE PRICE INDEX GOES UP SO THEY CAN UTILIZE IT OR NOT UTILIZE IT AS THEY SEE FIT AND IF NOT. SAU. HAVING HEARD THAT. YOU'RE STILL AT GROUND ZERO. AND YOU'RE ALSO ASKING FOR THE SUNSET TO BE REMOVED. SO WHY NOT TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO NEGOTIATE A REALLY GOOD DEAL HERE. IN ONE WAY BRING. EVERYONE TO PARITY AT THE TWO FIFTY AND LET THEM USE THE CPI INDEXING. OR REDUCE EVERYBODY DOWN TO THE TWO HUNDRED AND LET THEM CAPTURE THE CPI AT THAT LEVEL SEEMS LIKE YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WIN. AND GET EVERYBODY WHAT THEY WANT. WE HAVE AT TWO HUNDRED PLUS CPI RIGHT NOW AND IF SOMEONE BRINGS US CONSIDERATIONS AND AMENDMENTS WILL CONSIDER THAT WE'VE. YET TO SEE IT SO I'M I'M SUGGESTING THAT RIGHT NOW APES FAVORITE YEAH I APPRECIATE THE SUGGESTIONS I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT THIS MOMENT BUT I APPRECIATE IT. AND I THINK WE'LL CONTINUE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION. BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S AT TWO HUNDRED PLUS CPA I'M I DON'T THINK I'M. TOTALLY ARTICULATING SINCE EVERYBODY IS ALREADY AT. A TWO FIFTY ARE ALL THE OTHER PRODUCTS OR TWO FIFTY. AND YOU'RE ASKING THESE TO BE SEPARATE AT TWO HUNDRED. WOULD THAT NOT BE GOOD FOR YOU TO HAVE EVERYBODY AT THE TWO FIFTY WHERE THEY'RE ALL. AT PARITY OR WOULD IT BE EASIER FOR YOU TO REDUCE EVERYBODY. FROM TWO FIFTY DOWN TO TWO HUNDRED AND HAVE EVERYBODY AT PARITY AND STILL ENJOY THE. THE GROWTH OF CPI. YEAH COULD IT GOOD BUSINESS AND INTERVENE AS THE AS THE CHAIR PROPITIATE WHY ARE YOU DOING MISTER CHAIR I APPRECIATE WE'RE GOING OUT OF THAT. THE BILL DOESN'T CALL TO REDUCE EVERYTHING TO TWO HUNDRED AND IT TOTALLY NOT I'M TALKING AS AN OPTION. AND I'M SURE THEAUTHOR WOULD. CONSIDER. FURTHER DISCUSSIONS WITH BOTH SIDES ON ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. BUT SHE IS ASKING FOR THE REMOVAL OF A SUNSET. PRE EXISTING BILL BUT WAS IT WORTH IT WAS SET AT TWO HUNDRED. SO OF THAT IS THAT'S WHAT'S BEFORE US WITH THE CP I. THAT HASN'T BEEN UTILIZED. SO. I'M SURE THAT THE AUTHOR WOULD BE HAPPY CONSIDER CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS MOVING FORWARD AS IF THE BILL MOST OUR COMMITTEE BUT I APPRECIATE THE SPIRIT WHICH YOU'RE PRESENTING THAT. AND. I'M I'M SURE THAT SHE WILL TAKE THAT CONSIDERATION. IF ANYONE ELSE. SAME SCENE NO ONE TO TO HAVE MUCH. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE MISMA I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.
