THREE SEVENTY NINE THREE EIGHTY AND THREE EIGHTY ONE WHICH ARE THE GOVERNMENT FINANCE COMMITTEE. OF BILLS. OKAY WITH THAT -- I'D LIKE TO WELCOME UP. A SENATOR GLACIER ITEM NUMBER TEN SB FIVE THIRTY ONE IN WELCOME MISTER BLASIER SENATOR GLAZERS THIS WEEK. THANK YOU THANK YOU -- MADAM CHAIR FOR SHOULD THE TIME THIS MORNING THIS AFTERNOON -- THE BILL IN FRONT OF YOU -- SEEKS TO STOP A PERVERSE INCENTIVE IN OUR TAX CODE. THAT HAS LED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO GIVE AWAY. BILLIONS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TAX REVENUE TO PRIVATE COMPANIES. THESE DEALS TAKE MONEY FROM EVERY CITY IN THE STATE. AND THEY GIVE IT TO SOME OF THE RICHEST CORPORATIONS IN THE WORLD AND IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT. UNDER THE BRADLEY BURNS UNIFORM LOCAL SALES TAX LOST SALES TAX REVENUE IS ALLOCATED TO THE POINT OF SALE. NOW FOR BRICK AND MORTAR STORES THIS MEANS ALLOCATING THE REVENUE TO THE JURISDICTION IN WHICH THE STORES LOCATED PRETTY CLEAR. BUT ONLINE RETAILERS AND WE ALL KNOW HOW. MORE AND MORE THAT -- FOLKS REASON ONLINE HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE WHERE THEY ALLOCATE SALES TAX REVENUE. THAT COULD BE A WAREHOUSE IT COULD BE A DISTRIBUTION CENTER IT COULD EVEN BE A SALES OFFICE. THIS ALLOWS COMPANIES TO DIRECT REVENUE TO A SINGLE JURISDICTION IN THE STATE. NOW COMPANIES USE THIS AS LEVERAGE WHEN NEGOTIATING WITH THE LOCATE AND A CERTAIN PLACE IN THE STATE. AND THE RESULT OF THAT MY FRIENDS IS IS BEEN A RIG PROCESS -- DRIVING CITIES TO ACCEPT INCREASINGLY. ONEROUS TAX SHARING AGREEMENTS IN EXCANGE FOR ONLINE RETAILERS BUILDING. OR RELOCATING IN THEIR JURISDICTION. UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS. I THE COMPANY'S PROFIT BOTH FROM THEIR ONLINE SALES AND FROM THE SALES TAX REBATES. OFTEN CITIES WILL GIVE THESE COMPANIES MORE THAN HALF OF THE SALES TAX REVENUE. ALLOCATED TO THEIR JURISDICTION. HE'S COMPANIES BENEFIT AT THE EXPENSE OF THE PUBLIC. AT A TIME WHEN CITIES ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND PUBLIC PROGRAMS COMPANIES ARE SAFELY SIPHONING BILLIONS IN TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO THESE AGREEMENTS. FURTHER WHILE THESE DEALS ARE OFTEN TOUTED FOR CREATING JOBS AND HAVING SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC BENEFITS. IN MY VIEW THESE CLAIMS ARE DUBIOUS. SOME OF THESE AGREEMENTS DO NOT REQUIRE THAT THE PROMISED JOBS OR EVEN CREATED AND EVEN WHEN THEY DO. HIS JOBS CAN BE AN AND WAREHOUSE FACILITIES WHAT WHERE THE WORK IS GRUELING LOW WAGE AND LACK BENEFITS. SO THESE CITIES AT THAT DO THESE DEALS THEY DO NEED REAL JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR WORKING FAMILIES BUT WE DON'T NEED A RACE TO THE BOTTOM WHICH IS THE CURRENT SITUATION. FOR THOSE REASONS THE MEASURE THAT'S BEFORE YOU WOULD PROHIBIT ANY FUTURE SALES TAX SHARING AGREEMENTS. BETWEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND PRIVATE COMPANIES IT HAS NO EFFECT ON ANY EXISTING. AGREEMENTS. IT TAKES NO MONEY FROM ANY CITY. UNDER THIS BILL. BUT IT IS NOT AT AND IT DOES NOT REDUCE THE SALES TAX REVENUE TO ANY CITY CAN RECEIVE IN THE FUTURE. THEBILL HAS BROAD SUPPORT FROM -- WIDE RANGE OF FOLKS FROM THE LEAGUE OF CITIES WHICH WE HEAR IT FROM THE JUST A MOMENT. THE LABOR FEDERATION AND A VARIETY OF OTHER CITIES WHEN YOU DIG DOWN DEEP ON THIS ISSUE FIND THAT -- IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF MAKING THESE DEALS AND 95%. CITIES RICH AND POOR COASTAL IN LINE EVERYBODY ELSE HAS BEEN A LOSER. AT ALL WE'RE SAYING IN THIS BILL IS LET'S NOT MAKE IT WORSE WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE TAX CODE AND HOW THESE THINGS ARE HANDLED. BUT LET'S STOP THE BLEEDING -- IN THIS RACE TO THE BOTTOM WITH THAT HAPPY TO INTRODUCE DÃ¢N KERA REPRESENTING THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES THANK YOU BOTH THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- BIRDS -- DECKER COULD BE HELPFUL YOU CALIFORNIA CITIES OF THE LEAGUE TARTED TALKING ABOUT THIS THIS ISSUE IN TERMS OF THE EFFECTS OF YOU COMMERCE ON WERE ON LOCAL REVENUES INCLUDING SALES TAXES GOING BACK ALL THE WAY TO A TWENTY FIFTEEN HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF INTERNAL WORKING GROUPS AND OTHER. OTHER THINGS -- THIS THIS BILL IS SOMETHING IS POLICY THAT THAT -- THIS THIS RECOMMENDATION NUMBERS FROM THAT PROCESS. WE ARE AS MOST OF THE FOLKS IN THE ROOM NO ARE STAUNCH DEFENDER OF LOCAL AUTHORITY INCLUDING THE AUTHORITY OF OUR COMMUNITIES TO ENGAGE IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND WE COULD CONTINUE TO DO SO. THE CHALLENGE HERE WITH THIS ISSUE AND THE REASON THE LEGAL SUPPORTING IT IS SOME OF THESE AGREEMENTS REALLY HAVE THE EFFECT OF OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT REALLY REBUILDING ITS OWN REVENUE AS PART OF A ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT -- INCENTIVE IT'S REPEATING EVERYBODY ELSE'S REVENUE AND THAT'S KIND OF WERE FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT. WE WE THINK THAT THAT IT'S GOOD POLICY TO TO LIMIT THESE -- AND PROHIBIT THESE DEALS GOING FORWARD -- BUT AS THE AS THE SENATOR SAID IT DOESN'T AFFECT ANY EXISTING AGREEMENTS IT DOESN'T UNDERMINE THE ABILITY OF A LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO USE THEIR OWN RESOURCES TO TO GIVE ECONOMIC INCENTIVES. AND JOB WE WE THINK IT'S GOOD POLICY GOING FORWARD ESPECIALLY IN THE EVER EXPANDING -- ECONOMY IF HE COMMERCE -- AND WE WOULD URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR OTHER OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THEIR FLOCKS CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU MANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE -- ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME'S ANGIE MINETTI HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF FRESNO RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE. ALTHOUGH SB FIVE THIRTY ONE DOES GRANDFATHER IN EXISTING INCENTIVE AGREEMENTS -- ELIMINATING THE PROSPECT OF LEE REMAINS THE VERY VITAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TOOL THAT HAS BEEN PIVOTAL IN GRAB JOB CREATION LOCALLY. I FRESNO FEELS VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THIS MEASURE I'M WITH THE INCENTIVE AGREEMENTS THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO STRIKE WE'VE ATTRACTED BUSINESS AWAY FROM ARIZONA WITH ONE OF OUR IN -- DISTRIBUTION CENTERS ALSO HAVE SECURED THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED JOBS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY I'M WITH HUNDREDS MORE INDIRECT JOBS -- STEMMING FROM THESE INCENTIVE AGREEMENTS -- YOU KNOW DE THE INCENTIVES ARE ALL JOB CREATION BASED THE IF THE JOBS ARE CREATED THE INCENTIVES ARE NOT THERE FOR THE RETAILER AND SAY IT YOU KNOW FROM A TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY PERSPECTIVE WE BELIEVE THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE IN THESE AGREEMENTS WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE. YOU KNOW FULL DISCLOSURE FULL HEARINGS ON THESE TOPICS -- YOU KNOW WE ARE. AS AS A CENTER HAD MENTIONED THIS IS GETTING OUT THE SITE IS OF A SITE IS ALLOCATION ISSUE AND MEMBERS IF YOU'LL INDULGE ME FOR A MOMENT -- IF MY PINEAPPLE BLAZER THAT I'M WEARING RIGHT NOW IS NOT AVAILABLE IN THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO AND I GO TO SAN FRANCISCO TO PURCHASE IT. SACRAMENTO ISN'T GOING AFTER SAN FRANCISCO FOR THAT RAVENEL. ALL OF THAT REVENUE IS GOING TO SAN FRANCISCO WHERE THOSE JOBS ARE WHERE THE POINT OF SALE WAS WHERE THAT WORK WAS DONE WE WOULD DISPUTE THE SAME. FOR FRESNO IF THERE ARE ORDERS FILLED AND PACKAGES ARE FULFILLED IN OUR DISTRICT AND JOBS ARE THERE AND THAT'S WHERE THE WORKERS ARE PUTTING IN THE LABOR. AND THE WORK WE WOULD DISPUTE THAT THAT'S WHERE THE REVENUE SHOULD -- SHOULD GO NOW AGAIN WE BELIEVE THIS WARRANTS A MUCH LARGER CONVERSATION AND RIGHT NOW THIS BILL IS TAKING ONE ASPECT OF OUR TAX LAW. AND TAKING AWAY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TOOL THAT IS FREQUENTLY USED BY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. I'M THIS BILL SIMON'S OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE FRESNO OUT OF POVERTY AND CAN AND AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE OPPOSED THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU SO MUCH MUCH AUDIBLE GOV ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF PARIS. NOT SURE OF ANY OF YOU KNOW WHERE THE CITY OF PARIS'S IT'S A VERY THANK YOU IT'S A VERY FLAT DUSTY LITTLE LAND THERE'S NOT A LOT OF RESOURCES THERE. AND I LOVE IT I MEAN I PEOPLE LIVE THERE RIGHT AND SO THE IT SO HOME TO A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT IT'S NOT -- COASTAL IT'S NOT YOU KNOW IT'S JUST IT HAS THE RESOURCES THAT HAS IN THOSE ARE VERY LIMITED AT THIS POINT. THEY'VE HAD GENERATIONAL POVERTY AND THESE TAX TURN AGREEMENTS HAVE ALLOWED THEM TO SLOWLY CRAWL OUT OF THAT. JUST A QUICK STOP FROM THE CITY OF PARIS IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WAS 16%. DIRECTLY RELATED TO THESE TAX AND AGREEMENTS THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS DROPPED TO SIX POINT 7% AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE JOBS I KNOW PEOPLE ARE SAYING THESE ARE. POOR PAYING JOBS IN THE CITY OF PARIS AND I CAN ONLY SPEAK FOR OUR COMMUNITY AND FOR OUR TEXTURE IN AGREEMENTS THE WAGES THAT ARE WORKERS ARE PAID ARE UP. TO BETWEEN FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR TO TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR FOR NON MANAGEMENT POSITIONS AND IF YOU HAVE A MANAGEMENT POSITION YOU HAVE SIXTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR WHICH IS. A HUGE INCREASE FOR THE MEDIAN INCOME IN THE CITY OF PARIS I THINK THE AND I I DO BELIEVE THAT YOU THE THE AUTHOR IS TRYING TO HAVE A VERY. THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATION HOWEVER I THINK THERE ARE BIG PIECES OF THIS THAT ARE MISSING THE CITY OF PARIS DOES NOT HAVE ANY OTHER IT WOULD HAVE TRIED IT HAS TRIED. IT HAS BEEN TRYING TO GET AN IN AND OUT TO COME INTO THE CITY FOR FOUR YEARS WE HAVE FINE DINING THE CONSIST OF DENNY'S. I HOP SIZZLER IN PORKY'S I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT WAS UNTIL I WENT TO PARIS. IT IT THESE TEXTURED AGREEMENTS HAVE ALLOWED AN INCREMENTAL INCREASE IN THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THESE PEOPLE THAT THEN ALLOWS THEM TO HAVE DISCRETIONARY INCOME BECAUSE BEFORE THEY HAD NONE THEY WERE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK. AND THAT'SWHEN RETAILERS WANT TO COME INTO YOUR TOWN WHEN THEY SEE THAT YOU HAVE AN INCREASE IN YOUR MEDIUM CUP WHEN YOU SEE THAT YOUR RESIDENTS. CAN. PAY THE TEN DOLLARS FOR HAMBURGER IN AND OUT OTHER THAN THAT THERE HAS BEEN. A DEARTH OF CORPORATIONS AND RETAILERS AND SERVICES THAT WANT TO COME INTO THE CITY OF PARIS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE. ANY OTHER ECONOMIC TOOL TO INCENTIVIZE THEM TO COME THIS IS. LITERALLY ONE OF THEIR SINGULAR TOLD AND I APPRECIATE THAT THERE'S BEEN A CONVERSATION IN THIS BUILDING PARTICULAR ABOUT POSSIBLY HAVING REDEVELOPMENT. RESURFACE WHICH WOULD BE AMAZING WE WOULD SUPPORT THAT WE DO SUPPORT THAT BUT IF ANYONE READS THE PAPER IF ANYONE TRACKS GOVERNOR SOME COMMENTS. HE'S NOT FOR THAT AT LEAST NOT RIGHT NOW AND SO TO OFFER A SPECULATIVE TOOL FOR THEM. AND TAKING AWAY A LEGITIMATE TOOL. WE REALLY WOULD WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A MORE THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATION ABOUT LET'S LOOK AT EVERYTHING BUT THIS TOOL RIGHT NOW. TO BE REMOVED WITHOUT BACK FILLING IN SOME WAY. IS GOING TO HURT. THE RESIDENTS OF PARIS. EVEN KEEPING THEIR CURRENT AGREEMENTS BECAUSE YOU'VE JUST PUT A CEILING OVER US AND YOU'VE JUST SAID. GREAT WE'RE GRABBED THE YOU HAD EXCELLENT GROWTH DON'T EXPECT TO GROW ANYMORE. AND FOR THAT WE WOULD ASK THAT YOU OPPOSE AB S. I'M SORRY SB. FIVE THIRTY ONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE OTHERS IN OPPOSITION OF THE BILL. SEEING NONE OTHER ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE ON BEFORE. YES. BUT THAT IS ME SOMEONE VOEPEL. A QUESTION AND ALSO A COMMENT. QUESTION FIRST. I'D. IN OPPOSITION TO THIS. MAINLY BECAUSE I WAS MAYOR OF A CITY OF SIXTY THOUSAND AND WE MADE AN AGREEMENT WITH A MAJOR -- HOTEL SUPPLIER. THEY HAD A WAREHOUSE OF ONE PARTY CALIFORNIA BUT THEY WANTED TO CALL CENTER IN OUR CITY. OKAY SO THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT THIS BILL. I'M NOT SEEING HOW IT WOULD HELP. THE CITY LIKE. NINE THE CALL CENTER. IS IN OUR ZIP CODE. AND WE GET ALL THAT SALES TAX. EVEN THOUGH THE WAREHOUSES IN ANOTHER PART OF THE STATE SO. THAT'S A INTERESTING DICHOTOMY THERE -- MY QUESTION IS WOULD THE AUTHOR BE WILLING. TO AMEND. THIS TO CITIES. A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND POPULATION ARE HIGHER. THAT WAY THE YOUNGER SMALLER CITIES HAVE A CHANCE TO COMPETE. FOR CALL CENTERS WHERE HOUSES EXCEPT A BECAUSE THEY NEED TO WAVE MORE THAN SAN FRANCISCO LA OR SAN DIEGO [inaudible] SO. THAT'S MY QUESTION. WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO PUT A LIMIT POPULATION LIMIT. ON THE BILL. OF THROUGH THE CHAIR -- WELL THANK YOU FOR YOUR THOUGHTFUL QUESTION AND I THINK THAT -- THIS IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE YOU GET ON HERE WHEN YOU START TO PICK WINNERS OR LOSERS OR ADVANCED ONE GROUP AT COMMUNITY VERSUS ANOTHER I THINK IF THE OVERRIDING STATE GOAL IS FAIRNESS. IN OUR TAX SYSTEM FAIRNESS. WHERE EVERYBODY HAS THE SAME PLAYFIELD PLAYING FIELD IN WHICH? TO DEAL I THINK THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE STRIVING FOR HERE AND THAT I I RECOGNIZE THAT COMMUNITIES. AND THIS HAPPENS AND LOTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS. I IT COULD BECAUSE YOU HAVE -- MOUNTAINS ARE YOU HAVE A LAKE OR YOUR NEXT TO THE BECAUSE THERE'S ALL KINDS OF THINGS THAT MAKE. LIFE AND COMMUNITIES LIVE IT IS FAIR ENOUGH FAIR OR UNFAIR AND SO. I THINK THAT WENT ONCE YOU START CREATING THESE CARVE OUTS. LET'S JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR MANIPULATED BY OTHERS. OTHER WORDS IT YOU START CREATING THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE IT SPECIALIZE WILL THAT'S THE THAT'S THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM THEY'RE GOING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MANIPULATE THAT -- AND I ALL I CAN SAY IS IS THAT WELL I AM VERY SYMPATHETIC TO YOUR SITUATION THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH YOU COME FROM AS WELL AS THE OTHERS THAT HAVE SPOKEN TO HER TODAY -- THIS IS NOT A FOR IT WE SHOULD USE OUR TAX CODE TO DO THAT WHEN IT CAN BE SO MANIPULATED BY OTHERS -- TO THE DISADVANTAGE PUBLIC THE PUT THE PUBLIC GOOD AND THE PUBLIC GOOD IS A FAIR TAX SYSTEM WHERE THE IMPACTS. OF THOSE -- THAT COME FROM THOSE ENTERPRISES ARE ARE COVERED IN SOME FASHION. AND SO WHILE YOU TALK ABOUT THE CALL CENTER GETTING THE REVENUE BECAUSE IS DESIGNATED AT THE POINT OF SALE. THAT DISTRIBUTION FACILITY OR THAT MANUFACTURING FACILITY THAT HAS ALL THE TRUCK TRAFFIC AND MAYBE EVEN THE POLLUTION THEY'RE VERY IN ALL THE BIRDS. THE MANIPULATION IS THAT YOU HAVE THE AT THAT CITY YOU RECOGNIZE GETS THE BENEFIT BECAUSE THEY GET THE CALL CENTER THEIR DESIGNATING AS POINT OF SALE. THAT'S A MANIPULATION OF THE COAT IT'S NOT ABOUT WHERE IMPACTS HAPPEN AND YES IT DOES -- IT CAN'T HURT SMALLER COMMUNITIES BUT YOU COULD ALSO ARGUE THAT. THOSE ARE THE TYPE OF COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE THE LOWER TAX BASE -- THAT HAVE A MORE RESPONSIVE SAID. A COMMUNITY LESS REGULATION. SO THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS TO TRY. TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO MAKE THOSE CHOICES CITIES CAN AND ENGAGE IN THE WAY THEY THINK THEY CAN MAKE THEM COMPETITIVE BUT HERE'S THE THING. THEY CAN. CREATE INCENTIVES. THEY CAN USE THE BRADLEY BURNS SALES TAX EVEN UNDER THIS MEASURE TO CREATE INCENTIVES BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS THEY HAVE TO USE THEIR BRADLEY BIRDS. NOT EVERYBODY ELSE'S CITIES BRADLEY BURNS WHICH IS THE MANIPULATION TODAY SO THEY CAN. PUT THAT WELCOME THAT OUT IN pUSING THE TAX CODE THAT THEY THE MONEY THEY GET BUT IT'S THE MINUTE ELATION THAT I'M TRYING TO DO WITH THE IN THE BILL. RESPECTFULLY WERE LESS COMMON. ONE LAST COMMENT ON NOW -- AND THEN I'LL BE QUIET. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COMMAND CONTROL [inaudible] AND SUPPRESSING. COMMERCE. AND FREE ENTERPRISE AND PEOPLE THAT ARE WILLING. TO ACCEPT LESS TAXES FROM AN ENTITY IN ORDER TO GET. AN INCREMENT OF THE TAXES. SO WHAT I WOULD SAY IS. IF I'M IN A SMALL CITY THAT'S WILLING TO GIVE UP HALF THE SALES TAX. TO GET THAT ENTITY. WELL THEN WHERE EVER THEY WERE TO BEGIN WITH HAD BETTER CUT A DEAL TO THAT'S CALLED COMPETITION THAT HELPS KEEP PRICES LOW THAT HELPS THE JOBS. IT IS CALLED FREE ENTERPRISE WHO CAN MAKE THE BEST DEAL. THAT'S NOT COMMAND CONTROL SOCIALISTIC TYPE OF BUSINESS VENEZUELA HAS COMMAND CONTROL. I LIKE TO SEE HEALTHY COMPETITION I'M DONE. YES -- ASSEMBLYMEMBER BURNER HARLOT -- THINGS THAT ARE -- ACTUALLY MI SIX GREAT BUT IT LIKE THAT [inaudible] SO -- SORRY -- SO I DID MY SIX GRAY FUNDAY BACK AND LIKE PARIS BACK IN THE DAY I GREW UP IN THE INLAND EMPIRE AND THERE ARE COMMUNITIES. IN OUR STATE -- THAT DON'T HAVE RESOURCES SO COULD YOU ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS BROUGHT UP BY THE OPPOSITION IN TERMS OF COMMITTEES THAT DON'T HAVE RESOURCES LIKE THE CITY OF PARIS. IF THIS WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM WHAT OTHER OPTIONS DO YOU ENVISION OR DO WE HAVE AVAILABLE -- IF THIS WERE REMOVED. THROUGH THE CHAIR -- SO AT THIS MEASURE ONLY STOPS NEW DEALS FROM HAPPENING OKAY IT DOESN'T CHANGE ANY OF THE EXISTING DEALS THAT HAVE BEEN IN PLACE FOR TEN OR TWENTY YEARS. SO THE THE PUBLIC ENTITIES ARE LOSING ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS FROM THESE FEELS YEARLY. OKAY ACCORDING TO A FINANCIAL ANALYSIS THIS IS SAYS WE SHOULDN'T ALLOW IT TO CONTINUE TO HAPPEN. I IN THE WAY IT'S HAPPENING. THE THE DIFFICULTY IS THAT -- SHOULD WE BE USING THIS PART OF THE TAX CODE TO TAKE MONEY FROM THE 95% OF THE OTHER CITIES TO HELP. THAT THE A WHAT WOULD MAY BE VIEWED AS DISADVANTAGED CITIES THAT'S REALLY THE QUESTION AND AND FOR ME THE ANSWER IS NO. THAT THAT THIS PART OF THE TAX CODE SHOULD NOT WE SHOULD NOT ALLOW IT TO BE MANIPULATED BECAUSE WHILE YOU MAY FEEL IT'S HELPING THIS ONE DISADVANTAGED CITY. IT'S ONLY TAKING MONEY FROM 95% OF THE OTHER CITIES. IT'S ALLOWING THAT CORPORATION TO GET THE MONEY BACK TO THEM IN SOME CASES THESE DEALS GET A BACK TO THE COMPANY. AND THEY SAY WE'RE DOING THAT BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING THE JOBS THESE -- THESE THAT THESE GREAT WAREHOUSE JOBS -- SO LOOK I I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE THERE ARE FOLKS THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF IT AND WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO THAT UNDER UNDER THIS BILL IF IT WERE TO BECOME LAW BUT WE'RE NOT ON WINDING ANY DEALS. AND THEY STILL CAN USE THEIR THEIR THEIR TAX SYSTEM INCLUDING BRADLEY BURNS. TO PROVIDE INCENTIVES -- FOR THOSE COMPANIES TO LOCATE THERE THAT DOESN'T NOT NOTHING HERE TAKES THAT AWAY -- BUT I I I HAVE NO GREAT SOLUTION TO A PRIVILEGE THAT YOU KNOW AS A CITIES THAT ARE THAT ARE STRUGGLING I I DON'T THERE'S NO MAGIC BULLET OUT THERE ANYWHERE. AND CERTAINLY NOT IN THIS BILL IT JUST SAYS YOU CAN'T MAKE ANYMORE NEW DEALS TO TAKE THE MONEY FROM 95% OF THE OTHER CITIES. THANK YOU YES AS SOME RIVAS -- SO THANK YOU -- FOR THAT CLARIFICATION -- YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE HEARING THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT GONNA EXIST THOSE T WON'T AFFECT THOSE EXISTING CONTRACTS -- OR THOSE AGREEMENTS BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORT I THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW THIS THIS CERTAINLY ISN'T AN ISSUE. AND AND AND EASY ISSUE TO TACKLE IT WAS VERY COMPLICATED. BUT I THINK THAT THIS IS A VERY VERY GOOD BILL AND I THINK THAT -- IT CLEARLY ADDRESSES A PROBLEM -- AND THE PROVIDE THE NECESSARY REFORMS TO PREVENT THIS RACE TO THE BOTTOM IS IS IS IS IS IS WHAT WE'RE CONFRONTED WITH YOU KNOW EVEN OUR DISADVANTAGED -- OUR COMMUNITIES ARE BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF AT THE EXPENSE OF EVERYONE ELSE SO I APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORT I THINK IS A VERY GOOD BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE. OKAY BEFORE YOU MOVE ON IF YOU DON'T MIND OR WHAT IS STILL WAS A QUORUM SO WE CAN MOVE THIS ALONG -- SECRETARY.

OTHER REJECTED CLOSE THANK YOU FOR SOME MAY THINK THAT YOU MADAM CHAIR AND YOUR STAFF FOR WORK I REALLY READING A GREAT EXCELLENT ANALYSIS AND MEMBERS IN THE ANALYSIS IT POINTS OUT THAT THIS ISSUE'S BEEN LOOKED AT BY OUR STATE AUDITOR -- IT AS WELL AS THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S TO EXAMINE THIS ISSUE IN A NUMBER OF THE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED HERE ON THE COMMITTEE TODAY AND AND AND THE LA -- MADE IT CLEAR IN THERE THEN THEIR STATE AND THEY SAID THAT THESE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES DOES NOT RESULT IN ANY NET BENEFIT. TO OUR BROADER ECONOMIC REGION WITHIN OUR STATE. THAT THAT WITH YOU LOCATED NO CATION A OR B. OR C.. THAT IF THAT IS A THAT IF THE IF THE COMPANIES HAVE THE ABILITY TO MANIPULATE IT NO ONE WINS THERE EXCEPT WE LOSE THOSE TAX DOLLARS ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS. A YEAR SO I I I APPRECIATE THAT THOUGHTFUL CONSIDERATION THIS BILL'S GOTTEN BIPARTISAN SUPPORT ALL THE WAY THROUGH -- IT'S NOT MEANT TO BE IN OUR A. D. ISSUE IT'S IT'S GOT SUPPORT FROM FROM LABOR WHO RECOGNIZES THE LOSS OF TAX DOLLARS THAT -- WE'RE SUFFERING BY -- AND IT DOESN'T DEAL WITH THE BIG PROBLEM BUT IT SAYS LET'S STOP THE BLEEDING AND THE LEAGUE OF CITIES THAT CAN WORK ON THIS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND IT. AND WE'RE TOGETHER ON THIS WEEK THIS IS A A SAFE SPACE TO SAY LET'S NOT MAKE IT WORSE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL THE CITY'S -- EVEN THE DISADVANTAGE WANTS TO TRY TO FIND A BETTER PATH FORWARD BUT AT LEAST FOR NOW LET'S NOT MAKE IT WORSE WHAT WE HAVE MORE TO UNRAVEL IF THERE'S ANY UNRAVELING TO BE DONE. WITH THAT RESPECTFULLY ASTRONAUT.

ASTLEY CITY COUNCIL ELECIONS WERE HELD IN ODD NUMBER YEARS AND THE AUTHORITY BOARD ELECTIONS ARE HELD OR EVEN NUMBER YEARS HOWEVER RECENT CHANGES. HAVE COST THE CITY AND MY DISTRICT NOW TO HOLD THEIR ELECTIONS IN EVEN NUMBERED YEARS EXCUSE ME. THIS MAY CREATE A PROBLEM WITH THE CANDIDATES SIMULTANEOUSLY WRITING FOR THE CITY COUNCIL.

I WOULD LIKE. TO PRESENT TO YOU SB NINETY NINE TODAY AND I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US AND WE WILL ACCEPT THE AMENDMENT SUGGESTED. AND I WOULD CERTAINLY LIKE TO ADD THE CHAIR AS A PRINCE CO AUTHOR OF THAT. BE SUITABLE TO HER THE HONOR TO BE A PRINCIPAL FOR A GOOD TEAM ON THIS [inaudible] ONE THIS. LEGISLATION WILL ASSURE THAT AREAS. COUNTIES THAT HAVE THESE SEVERE FIRE. LIKELY AREAS AND MANY OF OUR ROLE DISTRICTS ARE SO PRO. ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES IS OFTEN. THE INGRESS AND EGRESS. TO GET FIRE FIGHTING EQUIPMENT IN TO THE AREA. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY TO GET PEOPLE OUT. AND WHATEVER THE DISASTER IS AND IT'S NOT JUST FIRES OF COURSE. ONE OF THE AREAS THAT I'VE REPRESENTED FOR A LONG TIME PARADISE. BUT MOST OF THE HISTORY ONLY HAD ONE WROTE. COMING DOWN THAT RIDGE. OUT. THE SECONDARY ROADS THEN FINALLY WAS. EFFECTED BUT THERE WAS DEFICIENT. THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS PROBLEM. WHEN THAT FIRE HIT? YEAR AND A HALF PRIOR. WHEN THE ORAL DAM SPILLWAY FAILED? NOT WITHSTANDING. BROUGHT MORE ROADS AVAILABILITY. EVACUATING THE HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE. THROUGH THREE COUNTIES. WAS QUITE A PROBLEM. SO WHAT THIS LEGISLATION DOES IS CREATE. AN ALTERNATIVE THAT FOR THESE AFFECTED AREAS. THERE MUST BE TO EVACUATION WROTE [inaudible] SECURED [inaudible] AVAILABLE. AND COMMUNICATED TO THE PUBLIC. SO THEY KNOW [inaudible] WHERE THIS [inaudible] WILL BE. AND THAT THEY CAN BE IN AN ORDERLY MANNER. MANY COUNTIES SINCE THESE DISASTERS HAVE STEPPED UP THEIR EVACUATION PLANTS. THE CENTERS WHERE THEY WILL ACCUMULATE PEOPLE AND SORT OUT. CARS AND TRAFFIC. BUT WE STILL ABSOLUTELY HAVE GOT TO HAVE. THE EXIT ROUTES. AND THIS WILL SET FORTH. A PLAN FOR THAT [inaudible] ONE VERY PERSONAL EXAMPLE OF THIS. THE FELLOW WHO IS A FRIEND OF MINE AND USED TO WORK FOR ME WAS THE CEO OF BUTTE COUNTY FOR MANY YEARS LIVED UP IN THE GAME. AND I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH HIM. HIS WIFE WAS EVACUATED HE WAS DOWN IN THE VALLEY AND SHE WAS AT THEIR HOME. TRYING TO GET OUT. SHE WAS USING. THE SKY WAY WHICH IS THE MAIN ROUTE AND SHE SAID OH MY GOD THERE'S FIRE. TO MY RIGHT. COMING RIGHT UP THE ROAD NOW THERE IS THE SECOND EXIT ROUTE THAT HAS JUST BEEN RE ESTABLISH A FEW YEARS AGO. HE SAID TURN AROUND HONEY AND GO THE OTHER WAY. WHICH SHE DID. SHE HAD NO MORE THAN TURNED AROUND AND SHE SAID WELL I GOT THE FIRES ON BOTH SIDES OF ME NOW. WELL SHE AND QUITE A FEW OTHERS GOT OUT. BUT WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN AT THAT SECONDARY ROUTE NOT BEEN AVAILABLE. NOR HAD THE SKY WAY BEEN IMPROVED. SO THAT MORE PEOPLE COULD ACTION. AND THAT VERY CONGESTED AREA AGAIN THESE ARE. PROBLEMS THAT WE FACE ALL OVER. AND SUCH CATASTROPHES WE'RE GOING TO GO GET TO DATE WILL CONTINUE TO HAPPEN. WE MUST BE READY AND THIS LEGISLATION GIVES. AN ALTERNATE ROUTE. THAT WOULD SAY BLACKS I WOULD. ASKYOUR INDULGENCE. AND YOUR AYE BOAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER OTHERS IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. AS LONG AS A SAY HOW DARE YOU IF YOU POSE. ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE. OKAY I NEED A MOTION ON THE TABLE. OKAY -- MOTION. FROM A ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY A SECOND BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER RIVAS -- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I WOULD ASK AN AYE VOTE RESPECTFULLY AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THE BILL -- WELL OBVIOUSLY I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BUT YOU KNOW AFTER YOU HAD THIS BILL WAY AND WATCHING THE TRAFFIC ON TELEVISION TRYING TO GET OUT OF THERE -- SCARED THE HECK OUT OF ME AND NOT LESS THOSE OF US WHO LIVE IN THOSE RURAL AREAS WE KIND OF KNOW WHERE THIS MIGHT BE SOME SIDE COUNTY ROADS BUT NOT EVERYBODY KNOWS THOSE. NO AND THE SAME OF PARADISE YOU KNOW THE WAY ON THE SKY WAY I'VE BEEN UP THERE NUMEROUS TIMES BUT I DON'T I DON'T KNOW THAT I KNEW THE SECOND. ROUTE TO GET OUT OF THERE IF I WAS STUCK IN THAT. SO I THINK THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS BILL IS THAT WE ARE SENDING OUT A MESSAGE TO EVERYBODY THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. YOU KNOW I'VE LIVED THROUGH THIS YES AND UNTIL YOU LIVE THROUGH IT YOU DON'T REALLY GET IT SOMETIMES AND SO I APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING THIS FORWARD IN A YOU KNOW I WANT TO BE A CO AUTHOR AS IT IS SAID BEFORE BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BRING THIS FORD.
