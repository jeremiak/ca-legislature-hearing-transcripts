JOINING ME TODAY ARE STEVEN MORAL VICE PRESIDENT. KAREN FISHER EXECUTIVE OFFICER. SHARE WALLACE ASSISTANT EXECUTIVE OFFICER. AND CARLOS ALVAREZ. AB ENFORCEMENT CHIEF. I WILL BEGIN WITH A BRIEF PRESENTATION. AND AN OVERVIEW OF THE BOARD AND THEN WE WILL -- ADDRESS THE ISSUES I PATH. THE GENERAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA WAS CREATED BY THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE IN. EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FIVE TO REGULATE DENTISTS. ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR YEARS LATER. THE BOARD REMAINS IN EXISTENCE AND REGULATES THE PRACTICE OF APPROXIMATELY NINETY THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED LICENSED DENTAL PROFESSIONALS. INCLUDING FORTY THREE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED NINE DENTISTS. FORTY FIVE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX REGISTERED DENTAL ASSISTANTS RDAS. AND ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE REGISTERED DENTAL ASSISTANT IN EXTENDED FUNCTIONS. IN ADDITION THE BOARD IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SETTING THE DUTIES. AND FUNCTIONS OF APPROXIMATELY. FIFTY THOUSAND ON LICENSE DENTAL ASSISTANTS. OUR BOARD IS COMPRISED OF FIFTEEN MEMBERS. A PRACTICING DENTIST. ONE REGISTERED DENTAL HYGIENIST. ONE DENTAL ASSISTANT. BY PUBLIC MEMBERS WHO ACCOUNT FOR ONE THIRD OF THE MEMBERSHIP. THE GOVERNOR APPOINTS THE DENTISTS. THE R. A. D. H. D. RDA AND THREE PUBLIC MEMBERS THE ASSEMBLY. THE SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE RULES COMMITTEE EACH AT A POINT ONE PERSON. I AM THE PUBLIC MEMBER. APPOINTED BY THE SENATE. OF THE EIGHT PRACTICING DENTIST ONE MUST BE A MEMBER. OF A FACULTY OF ANY CALIFORNIA DENTAL SCHOOL. VICE PRESIDENT MORAL CURRENTLY FAILS THAT POSITION. ADDITIONALLY ONE MEMBER IS REQUIRED TO BE A DENTIST PRACTICING IN A NON PROFIT COMMUNITY CLINIC. THERE IS CURRENTLY ONE PUBLIC -- VACANCY. THE MISSION OF THE BOARD IS TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC. AND PROMOTE THE ORAL HEALTH AND SAFETY OF CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. BY ENSURING QUALITY DENTAL HEALTHCARE IN CALIFORNIA. IN ORDER TO FULFILL ITS MISSION. THE BOARD IMPLEMENTS REGULATORY PROGRAMS. AND PERFORMS A VARIETY OF FUNCTIONS SUCH AS SETTING LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS. IN ISSUING AND RENEWING LICENSES. INCLUDING A VARIETY OF PERMITS AND CERTIFICATIONS. THE BOARD ALSO HAS ITS OWN ENFORCEMENT DIVISION. WITH SWORN AND NON SWORN STAFF. WHICH IS TASKED WITH INVESTIGATING BOTH CRIMINAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE VIOLATIONS OF THE DENTAL PRACTICE ACT. AND OTHER LAWS. AS PART OF THE DISCIPLINARY FUNCTION AT THE BOARD. IT ALSO MONITORS DENTISTS. AND R. D. A.'S WHO MAY BE ON PROBATION. AND MANAGES A DIVERSION PROGRAM FOR LICENSEES WHO PRACTICE PRACTICE MAY BE. IMPAIRED DUE TO ABUSE DANGEROUS OUT. THE GENERAL BOARD IS A SELF SUPPORTING SPECIAL FINE. THE TWO STAINS. THAT OBTAINS ITS REVENUE FROM LICENSING AND PERMIT. VISA DENTISTS REGISTERED DENTAL. AND REGISTERED DENTAL ASSISTANTS AND EXTENDED FUNCTIONS. WE RECEIVE NO MONEY FROM THE GENERAL FUND. THE REVENUES ARE DEPOSITED IN MAINTAINED IN TWO SEPARATE ACCOUNTS. WHICH ARE NOT CO MINGLED THE DENTISTRY FIND. HAS AN APPROPRIATION OF APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. AND THE DENTAL ASSISTING FINE AND APPROPRIATIONS OBJECTS UNDER TWO POINT FIVE MILLION. THE BOARD SUPPORTS A STAFF OF SEVENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES WHO WORK IN VARIOUS UNITS SUCH AS ADMINISTRATION. COMPLAINT IN COMPLIANCE DISCIPLINE COORDINATION INVESTIGATION AND ANALYSIS. ENFORCEMENT EXAMINATION AND LICENSING. WE MAINTAIN TWO OFFICES ONE HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND ONE AND THEN OF COURSE WHEN OFFICE. IN ORANGE COUNTY. THIS CONCLUDES MY REMARKS. AND IF THERE ARE NO QUESTIONS. WE WILL BEGIN ADDRESSING THE ISSUES THAT ARE OUTLINED IN TODAY'S AGENDA [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] FOR MORE. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS SERRA WALLACE. THE BOARD HAS BEEN ASKED TO SPEAK TO WHETHER IT IS RECEIVED ANY COMPLAINTS RELATING TO REGISTER DENTAL ASSISTANCE. OTHERWISE KNOWN AS RDAS THAT HAVE NOT PASSED THE SUSPENDED PRACTICAL EXAMINATION WHETHER IT BELIEVES A PRACTICAL EXAMINATION AS ESSENTIAL TO MEASURING COMPETENCY OF RDAS. AND WHETHER IT BELIEVES THE PRACTICAL EXAMINATION SHOULD BE REVIVED EFFECTIVE JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY OR IF ITS CURRENT SUSPENSION SHOULD BE MADE PERMANENT. DURING THE BOARDS LAST SUNSET REVIEW IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN CONCERNS WERE RAISED RELATING TO THE PASSING RATE OF THE BOARD RDA PRACTICAL EXAMINATION. DISCUSSION SURROUNDING THESE CONCERNS RESULTED IN THE PASSAGE OF ASSEMBLY BILL. ONE SEVENTY NINE AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONEY M. THAT AUTHORIZED THE BOARD TO SUSPEND THE PRACTICAL EXAMINATION. IF FOR A VIEW OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CAN THE PROFESSIONAL EXAMINATION SERVICES. OTHERWISE KNOWN AS P. E. S. CONCLUDED THE PRACTICAL EXAMINATION WAS UNNECESSARY OR DID NOT ACCURATELY MEASURE THE COMPETENCY OF RDAS IN CALIFORNIA. THE BOARD ALONG WITH THE DENTAL ASSISTING COUNSEL DETERMINED THAT AN OCCUPATIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE RT PROFESSION MUST BE CONDUCTED TO DEVELOP A DESCRIPTION OF CURRENT PRACTICE IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL JOB TASKS THAT ENTRY LEVEL LICENSEES. MUST BE ABLE TO PERFORM SAFELY AND COMPETENTLY. O. P. S. CONDUCTED THE OCCUPATIONAL ANALYSIS IS REQUESTED AND THE RESULTS OF THE PROJECT WERE ALSO USED TO ENSURE THE CONTENT OF WRITTEN PRACTICAL AND LAWN ETHICS LICENSING EXAMINATIONS. REFLECTED THE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS THAT ARE CRITICAL FOR PUBLIC PROTECTION. IN ADDITION TO THE OCCUPATIONAL ANALYSIS OPS CONDUCTED A REVIEW OF THE RDA PRACTICAL EXAMINATION. AND RECOMMENDED THE BOARD IMMEDIATELY SUSPEND THE ADMINISTRATION OF IT. FURTHER OPS CONCLUDED THERE WAS A RELATIVELY LOW RISK OF HARM TO THE PUBLIC FROM THE SUSPENSION OF THE EXAMINATION. BECAUSE OF OTHER MEASURES IN PLACE SUCH AS THE REQUIREMENT FOR APPLICANTS TO PASS A WRITTEN EXAMINATION AND THE FACT THAT RDAS. ARE REQUIRED TO BE UNDER THE GENERAL OR DIRECT SUPERVISION OF A LICENSED DENTIST. ON APRIL SIXTH TWO STOP. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE BOARD VOTED TO SUSPEND THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE PRACTICAL EXAMINATION. AT ITS AUGUST TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN MEETING THE BOARD AND THE DENTAL ASSISTING COUNSEL CONSIDERED ALTERNATIVES PRESENTED BY OPS RELATING TO ASSESSING THE COMPETENCY OF RDA CANDIDATES. TO BE TO PERFORM THE CLINICAL PROCEDURES NECESSARY FOR LICENSURE. THE BOARD APPOINTED A SUBCOMMITTEE TO EVALUATE -- THAN A PRACTICAL EXAMINATION TO BRING BACK TO THE BOARD AND THE DENTAL ASSISTING COUNCIL FOR CONSIDERATION AT A FUTURE MEETING. AFTER CONSIDERING FEEDBACK RECEIVED DURING A STAKEHOLDER WORKSHOP THE SUBCOMMITTEE RECOMMENDED ALTERNATIVES AT THE NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN BOARD MEETING. CONSIDERATION WAS GIVEN NOT ONLY TO PUBLIC PROTECTION BUT TO WHETHER THE NEW ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS WOULD ELIMINATE OVERLY RESTRICTIVE ELIGIBILITY STANDARDS. OR STANDARDS OF PRACTICE THAT UNDULY LIMIT COMPETITION BETWEEN PROFESSIONALS OR PLACE UNDUE BURDENS ON THOSE WHO WANT TO ENTER THE PROFESSION. ULTIMATELY THE BOARD AND THE DENTAL ASSISTING COUNCIL VOTED TO ADOPT AN ALTERNATIVE. TO THE PRACTICAL EXAM WHICH REQUIRES ELIGIBILITY FOR RT LICENSURE BE BASED ON COMPLETION OF THE CURRENT APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS. AS ESTABLISHED BY CURRENT LAW AND REGULATION. AND SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION AND PASSING OF THE ALREADY A WRITTEN EXAMINATION AND THE RDA LAW AND ETHICS WRITTEN EXAMINATION. THE BOARD IN THE DENTAL ASSISTING COUNSEL BELIEVE THAT THIS OPTION WAS THE MOST REASONABLE AN OPTIMAL IT WILL NOT INTRODUCE ADDITIONAL BARRIERS TO RT LICENSURE. THE DECISION IS SUPPORTED BY THE FACT THE CANDIDATES ARE REQUIRED TO TAKE AND PASS A WRITTEN EXAMINATION. AND ONCE LICENSED THE DUTIES ARE SUPERVISED BY THE DENTIST THEREFORE THE PUBLIC IS THAT LITTLE RISK OF HARM. I PRACTICAL EXAMINATION WOULD NOT PROVIDE ADDITIONAL PUBLIC PROTECTION WE ARE NOT CONFERRED BY SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF AN EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM FOR WRITTEN EXAMINATION. SINCE THE SUSPENSION OF THE PRACTICAL EXAMINATION IN APRIL TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE BOARD IS ISSUED APPROXIMATELY FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED LICENSES TO RDAS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE BOARD HAS NOT RECEIVED COMPLAINTS RELATING TO RDAS LICENSE WITHOUT HAVING TAKEN A PRACTICAL EXAM. THE BOARD DOES NOT BELIEVE A PRACTICAL EXAMINATION IS ESSENTIAL TO MEASURING COMPETENCY OF RDAS TO BECOME INITIALLY LICENSED IN CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE PROFICIENCY IN PERFORMING THEIR LICENSURE AND IS RELATED TO THE RDA GAINING FURTHER PRACTICE AND EXPERIENCE IN DENTAL OFFICES UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THEIR EMPLOYER DENTISTS. ADDITIONALLY THE SUPERVISING DENTIST IS THE ULTIMATE JUDGE AN ARBITER OF THE X.. OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE RTA DEMONSTRATE SUFFICIENT PROFICIENCY TO PERFORM THE RTA DUTIES IN THE DENTIST'S OFFICE. CURRENTLY THE SUSPENSION OF THE PRACTICAL EXAMINATION IS ONLY AUTHORIZED IN STATUTE UNTIL JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THE CURRENT SUSPENSION OF THE RDA PRACTICAL EXAMINATION BE MADE PERMANENT. AND THAT THE ELIGIBILITY FOR RT LICENSURE BE BASED ON THE COMPLETION CURRENT APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS. I WISH I CURRENT LAW AND REGULATION AND SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF PASSING OF THE ALREADY WRITTEN EXAMINATION AND RDA WANT AFFECTS WRITTEN EXAMINATION. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS KAREN FISHER AND I'M GOING TO BE ADDRESSING ISSUE NUMBER SIX RELATING TO THE PORTFOLIO EXAMINATION. THE BOARD HAS BEEN ASKED TO CHARACTERIZE THE SUCCESS OF LICENSURE BY PORTFOLIO EXAMINATION. AND TO PROVIDE INFORMATION REGARDING ANY ISSUES RELATING TO HOW THIS PATHWAY TO DENTAL PROFESSION IMPACTS STUDENTS. SEEKING TO PRACTICE DENTISTRY WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE PORTFOLIO PATHWAY TO LICENSURE IN CALIFORNIA IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INNOVATIVE METHODS OF DENTAL LICENSURE. THE CONCEPT OF THE BOARDS PORTFOLIO CURRICULUM INTEGRATED CLINICAL EXAMINATION WAS BORN FROM THE IDEA THAT NO MORE HUMAN SUBJECTS WOULD BE USED FOR POST GRADUATION CLINICAL LICENSURE EXAMINATIONS. UPON THIS PREMISE THE BOARD MOVE FORWARD WITH THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A CURRICULUM INTEGRATED CLINICAL LICENSURE EXAMINATION. FOR STUDENTS GRADUATING FROM DENTAL SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA. THE PORTFOLIO PATHWAY TO LICENSURE ALLOWS STUDENTS TO BUILD A PORTFOLIO OF COMPLETED CLINICAL EXPERIENCES AND CLINICAL COMPETENCY EXAMINATIONS. IN SIX SUBJECT AREAS OVER THE COURSE CODE COURSE OF THEIR CLINICAL TRAINING IN DENTAL SCHOOL. INSTEAD OF TAKING A SET SINGLE EXAMINATION ON A LIFE PATIENT. OVER THE COURSE OF THE WEEKEND. THE PORTFOLIO PROCESS OFFERS MULTIPLE BENEFITS TO STUDENTS AND PATIENCE INCLUDING LETTING STUDENTS EXTEND TREATMENT OVER MULTIPLE PATIENT VISITS WHICH REDUCES THE STRESS OF A ONE TIME TESTING EVENT. AND MORE CLOSELY SIMULATES REAL WORLD PATIENT CARE. THE PATHWAY PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PATIENTS TO RECEIVE FOLLOW UP TREATMENT IS NEEDED AND PROVIDES A METHOD BY WHICH STUDENTS ARE READY FOR LICENSURE UPON GRADUATION. THIS PATHWAY TO LICENSURE HAS THE FULL SUPPORT OF THE SIX DENTAL SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA. HOWEVER OF STUDENT PARTICIPATION HAS DROPPED. SOME HAVE SPECULATED THAT STUDENTS ARE CONCERNED WITH PORTABILITY BETWEEN STATES FOR EXAMPLE I A STUDENT IS LICENSED BY THE PORTFOLIO PATHWAY IN CALIFORNIA. WITH THIS LICENSE BE ACCEPTED IN ANOTHER STATE. THE BOARD CONTINUES TO WORK WITH SCHOOLS AND STUDENTS TO RESPOND TO CHALLENGES PRESENTED BY THIS PATHWAY TO LICENSURE IN CALIFORNIA. DURING THE PAST FOUR YEARS THE BOARD HAS RESPONDED TO INQUIRIES FROM OTHER STATES EXPRESSING AN INTEREST IN THE CALIFORNIA PORTFOLIO MODEL. THE BOARD HAS MADE ALL MATERIAL DEVELOPED FROM INCEPTION TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PORTFOLIO PATHWAY TO LICENSURE. AVAILABLE ON THE BOARD'S WEBSITE INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE INITIAL LEGISLATION. THE CONSULTANT PSYCHOMETRIC EXAM AND IT'S THE REGULATIONS AS WELL AS THE CANDIDATE AN EXAMINER HANDBOOKS. FOR IMPLEMENTATION. OTHER STATES HAVE NOW HAVE THE ROADMAP TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT IMPLEMENT CALIFORNIA'S CURRICULUM INTEGRATED CLINICAL EXAMINATION SHOULD THEY CHOOSE TO DO SO. A NATIONAL MOVEMENT HAS BEGUN. TO CONSIDER USING CALIFORNIA'S HYBRID PORTFOLIO EXAMINATION AS THE CLINICAL EXAMINATION THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE BY THE AMERICAN DENTAL ASSOCIATION THE AMERICAN DENTAL EDUCATORS ASSOCIATION AND THE AMERICAN STUDENT DENTAL ASSOCIATION. TO PROMOTE A COMPENDIUM OF CLINICAL COMPETENCIES BASED ON CALIFORNIA'S PROGRAM THIS IS A MEASURE I JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT TO THE FIVE MINUTES REMAINING FOR THE FULL PRESENTATION OF AFFORD ITSELF SO IF YOU WISH TO RENT AND THIS THIS CONCLUDES MY REMARKS. PERFECT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND JUST AS A REMINDER THAT THE BOARD WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE. A WRITTEN RESPONSES TO ANY MEMBERS OF THIS JOINT COMMITTEE SHOULD THERE BE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS SO I CAN WRITTEN RESPONSES CAN BE PROVIDED. IN ADDITION TO THE TEST MONEY MADE HERE TODAY SO -- ANY REMAINING A PRESENTATIONS REMAIN COMMENTS OR ANY ITEMS THAT WISHING TO BE ADDRESSED. YEAH. MORNING MY NAME IS DOCTOR STEPHEN MARLEY. DURING PRIOR SUNSET REVIEW THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE DISCUSSED FOREIGN DENTAL SCHOOL APPROVALS AND ONE OF THE CURRENT PROCESS FOR APPROVING FOREIGN DENTAL SCHOOL TO SUFFICIENT. OR WHETHER THE BOARD SHOULD CONSIDER HIM ACCREDITING ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE COMMISSION ON DENTAL ACCREDITATION COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS CODA. FOR FOREIGN DENTAL SCHOOL APPROVALS THE LEGISLATURE RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO ENSURE THAT GRADUATES OF FOREIGN DENTAL SCHOOL TO HAVE RECEIVED AN EDUCATION. THAT IS EQUIVALENT TO THAT OF ACCREDITED INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND THAT ADEQUATE REPAIRS THEIR STUDENTS. FOR THE PRACTICE OF DENTISTRY SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS IN CALIFORNIA. AS A GRADUATE OF APPROVED AT ALL SCHOOLS. THE BOARD'S AUTHORITY TO APPROVE FOR IN DENTAL SCHOOL TO SOUNDED IN BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE SECTION SIXTEEN THIRTY SIX POINT. FOR THE INSTITUTIONAL STANDARDS UPON WHICH THE BOARD EVALUATES FORMED ALL SCHOOLS WERE INITIALLY ESTABLISHED BASED UPON THE COMMISSION ON DENTAL ACCREDITATION. STANDARDS USED FOR DENTAL EDUCATION AT THAT TIME. IN THE UNITED STATES. WHAT AT THE TIME THAT THIS THAT YOU WENT INTO EFFECT COATED DID NOT HAVE A PROGRAM TO EVALUATE INTERNATIONAL SCHOOLS? WELL THROUGHOUT THE YEARS CODA HAS CONTINUED TO REVIEW AND REVISE ITS STANDARDS. THE BOARD HAS NOT KEPT PACE WITH THESE CHANGES BY UPDATING REGULATIONS. THE BOARD ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE CALIFORNIA STANDARD SHOULD BE UPDATED AND REFLECT CODA STANDARDS HOWEVER. COMPLETING THIS UPDATE THROUGH THE REGULATORY PROCESS HAS PROVEN VERY ARDUOUS. THE PROCESS BY WHICH REGULATIONS ARE UPDATED TAKES ANYWHERE FROM NINE TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO BECOME EFFECTIVE. CODE IMPLEMENTS REVISIONS ON A REGULAR BASIS AS AN EXAMPLE BETWEEN JANUARY ONE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND JANUARY. ONE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN CODY IMPLEMENTED REVISIONS TO THREE EVENTS ACCREDITATION STANDARDS. IF THE BOARD BEGIN THE PROCESS OF BRINGING ITS EDUCATIONAL STANDARDS IN LINE WITH COTA. IT IS LIKELY THAT BY THE TIME THE PROCESS IS FINISH THOSE STANDARDS. AGAIN WILL HAVE BEEN REVISED BY KOTA REALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE BOARD TO KEEP CURRENT WITH CODE IS STANDARDS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT THERE ARE OVER OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS -- THERE HAVE BEEN ONLY THREE DAHLE SCHOOL FOR IN THOSE SCHOOLS OUT OF APPLIED. FOR APPROVAL TO THE BOARD TO HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND ONE DID NOT COMPLETE THE PROCESS. STATUTES IMPORTANT PART ALSO STATE THE FOLLOWING THE LEGISLATURE HEREBY URGES ALL DENTAL SCHOOLS. IN THE STATE TO PROVIDE IN THEIR CURRICULUM A TWO YEAR COURSE OF STUDY THAT MAY BE UTILIZED BY GRADUATES OF FOREIGN DENTAL SCHOOLS. TO ATTAIN THE PREREQUISITES FOR LICENSURE IN CALIFORNIA. SINCE INCEPTION OF THIS STATUTE FIVE OF THE CURRENTLY SIX DENTAL SCHOOLS IN CAL I HOPE CALIFORNIA HAVE ESTABLISHED THAT INTERNATIONAL PROGRAM. ADVANCES HAVE BEEN MADE IT COATED WITH REGARD TO INTERNATIONAL DENTAL SCHOOL ACCREDITATION. IN NOVEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE AMERICAN DENTAL ASSOCIATION SUPPORTED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CODE IS STANDARD COMMITTEE ON INTERNATIONAL ACCREDITATION. GO TO HAS NOW A RIGOROUS AND COMPREHENSIVE INTERNATIONAL ACCREDITATION PROGRAM FOR PRE DOCTORAL DENTAL EDUCATION CURRENTLY THERE ARE A NUMBER OF INTERNATIONAL DAHLE SCHOOLS UTILIZING THE CODA CUMULATIVE SERVICES AND ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF THE APPROVAL PROCESS OF THE BILL BOARD BELIEVES THAT THE BEST WAY TO MEET THE LEGISLATURE'S NEED. TO ENSURE THAT GRADUATES OF FOREIGN DENTAL SCHOOLS I RECEIVE AN EDUCATION THAT IS EQUIVALENT. TO THAT OF ACCREDITED INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES IS TO REQUIRE FOREIGN DENTAL SCHOOLS TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE. THE CODA INTERNATIONAL CONSUL ASIAN PROCESS THAT IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO ALL FOREIGN DENTAL SCHOOLS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY FINAL. REMARKS BY THE BY THE BOARD AT THIS TIME. OKAY AS SEEN IN ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS I SEE A NUMBER OF COLLEAGUES AND FIRST UP WITH START WITH SENATOR HILL FOLLOWED BY SENATOR. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR IN TO THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION IT WAS -- QUITE ENLIGHTENING AND I APPRECIATE THE GREAT WORK THAT THE THAT THE BOARD DOES. OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS RELEASED IN THE PREVIOUS SESSION WE HAD QUITE A NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS AND LEGISLATION ON PEDIATRIC ANESTHESIA ANASTASIA SDGS -- AND AND THANKFULLY -- CHAIR GLAZERS BILL -- IS NOW A HAS THERE BEEN ANY THOUGHT OF AND I'VE HEARD THIS FROM SOME OTHERS OF HAVING A AND OF A A STATUTORILY REQUIRED POSITION OF AN ORAL SURGEON ON THE BOARD. IS THAT BEEN CONTEMPLATED AT ALL OR DO YOU DO YOU SEE THE BENEFIT OF THAT -- IN THE CONTEMPLATION AND DISCUSSION. WE'VE HAD THE ADVANTAGE AS WE WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS. OF HAVING SOMEONE WHO FEEL THAT POSITION AND WE ARE WILL WELL WELL AWARE OF THE FACT THAT IF WE DON'T. WHEN WHEN HE TERMS OFF OF THE BOARD? IT'S IT'S GOING TO BE IT SEVERE LOSS -- I CAN'T SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD. BUT I THINK THAT WE ALL HAVE SEEN THIS SAYS CITY OF HAVING SOME DEDICATED PERSON FOR THAT POSITION. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR ARCHULETA FOLLOWED BY SOME MEMBER OBERNOLTE YES THANK YOU LADIES AND JOHN FOR COMING BEFORE US. AND MY QUESTION ALMOST THE SAME AS SENATOR HILL IN A MINUTE. A LITTLE HIGHER ON THIS QUESTION -- THE ORAL BOARD -- THAT YOU YOU CONDUCT EVERY SINGLE YEAR I'M SURE TO GET PEOPLE IN AND SO ON THE THE QUESTION ABOUT THE ORAL SURGEON IT IS SO VERY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF OR AND HOPEFULLY THAT ONE DAY THAT THERE WILL BE SOMEONE -- ON THE BOARD OF THE COMPLETE THE THE A PRACTICING DENTIST BUT ALSO THE EDUCATION STANDARDS IT MUST ALSO BE MET BY THE REGISTERED DENTAL ASSISTANT ASSISTING THAT DR. SO WE NEED TO SEE WHERE THAT EDUCATION IS GOING TO MATCH. THE THE PRACTICE OF FOR SURGERY. AND WITH TRANSPLANTS AND THINGS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE. AND I WOULD IMAGINE THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS THAT WE'VE HEARD -- BECAUSE WHEN YOU YOU'RE WATCHING A TV COMMERCIAL THAT SAID YOU WALKED IN ON MONDAY AND BY MONDAY AFTERNOON YOU WALK OUT WITH A COMPLETE SET OF TEETH. AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT AN ORAL SURGEON THE THE PRACTICING DENNIS WILL ALWAYS TELL YOU IT'S A LONG PROCESS -- SO I'M WANTING HOW YOU'RE DRESSED IN THAT ISSUE OF THAT ADVERTISEMENT THAT IS IN SOME CASES MISLEADING. BECAUSE IF YOUR BODY DOESN'T ADJUST THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN OVERNIGHT. I'LL START TO TAKE A STAB AT THIS ONE SO I'M MY NAME IS KAREN FISHER AND THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER THE DOWN BOARD. WHEN WE SEE QUESTIONABLE PRACTICES GOING ON WE DO START INVESTIGATIONS AND WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THERE HAVE BEEN ANY VIOLATIONS OF THE DENTAL PRACTICE ACT? SO WE DO ACT PROACTIVELY IN THAT RESPECT -- BUT WE ALSO OUR COMPLAINT DRIVEN STEVE COMPLAINTS FROM CONSUMERS ABOUT TREATMENT PROVIDED BY ANY KIND OF A DENTIST WHETHER IT'S A PROCESS HONEST OR AN ORTHODONTIST OR AN ORAL SURGEON WE DO INVESTIGATE THOSE COMPLAINTS FULL FULLY. AND UTILIZE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS TO ASSIST US IN THAT EFFORT. SO TEN FIFTEEN YEARS AGO WE WOULDN'T BE ASKING THIS QUESTION BUT WITH THE TECHNOLOGY AND AND INTERNET. TELEVISION ADVERTISING AND SO ON AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THERE DOING THAT -- MY CONCERNED IT WOULD GET TO KEEP A GOOD EYE ON THAT ABSOLUTELY AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RDAS ARE ARE IN TUNE WITH THAT TYPE OF PRACTICE AND AS WE LEARN AND AND TO FIND NEW WAYS. TO TREAT THE PATIENT THAT THE RDAS ARE ALSO GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY EDUCATE THEMSELVES. TO MATCH SHOULD MEET AND THE PROCEDURES THAT ARE WILL WILL E FOLLOW. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENT. I JUST. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLYMEMBER OLD ABILITY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- I DON'T HAVE A QUESTION AS MUCH AS A COMMENT I THINK QUITE OFTEN WHEN WE HAVE THESE OVERSIGHT HEARINGS. THE TENDENCY IS TO FOCUS ON ALL THE PROBLEM ISSUES AND WE COME ACROSS THIS KIND OF CRITICAL AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO PAUSE AND GIVE YOU COMPLIMENTS WHEN YOU DESERVE A COMPLIMENT. AND I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT OUR FIRST THING IT IS TO SEE HOW WILLING TO INNOVATE YOU ARE BECAUSE I THINK WHEN WE'RE IN OUR REGULATORY ROLE SOMETIMES WE JUST STICK TO ORTHODOXY AND WE'RE NOT WILLING TO TAKE RISKS. AND OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH THE ELIMINATION FOR THE DENTAL ASSISTANTS I THINK IT'S REALLY REFRESHING I CAN COUNT ON ONE HAND. THE NUMBER OF TIMES THAT WE'VE HAD TO ABORT COME IN HERE AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT WE DECIDED THERE'S NO PUBLIC BENEFIT. IN HAVING MORE OVERSIGHT AND SO WE WANT TO SCALE IT BACK WHEN THE STATISTICS AND THE DATA BACK US UP -- SO THANKS FOR STICKING TO YOUR GUNS ON THAT -- AND ALSO THE LICENSURE BY PORTFOLIO I THINK IS A REALLY GREAT THING TO SEE WHERE YOU'RE WILLING TO SAY WE HAVEN'T WE THINK THAT'S A BETTER WAY OF DOING IT. AND WE'RE GONNA BUILD A SYSTEM THAT COULD BE THE MODEL FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY IN THE ENTIRE WORLD SO. THANKS FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING THERE AND TO KEEP IT UP DOCTOR PAT. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH AND THE DOWNWARD BEING HERE AND THE WORK THAT YOU DO -- I DID WANT TO ASK ABOUT CONTINUING EDUCATION I SHOULD VERY FRAME IT BY ESPECIALLY ESPECIALLY FOR THIS YEAR IS THAT THIS YEAR THE ONLY HEALTH PROFESSION BOARD THAT WE'RE VIEWING TODAY -- IT'S THE GENERAL USER QUESTIONS I ASK. ALMOST ALL THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS BOARDS -- SO WHAT COMES TO CONTINUING EDUCATION FIRST OF ALL I DO MAKE NOTE AND I THINK YOU HAD A BIT OF RESPONSE IN TERMS OF THE ACTUALLY THE FREQUENCY IN WHICH PEOPLE DON'T COMPLETE THEIR CONTINUED EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS -- SO I NEED AT THAT EIGHTEEN PER POINT 5% OF DDS -- LICENSEES AND 45% OF THE RDA LICENSEES FIELD AUDITS AND SENSE OF DIED SO -- CERTAINLY THAT'S VERY CONCERNING -- CAN YOU PERHAPS SPEAK TO HOW YOU PLAN TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE SEEMS TO BE A RATHER HIGH PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE THAT COMPLAIN OF CONTINUING EDUCATION. UL ATTEMPT THIS ONE TOO SO -- IT THE AUDITS OF THE REGISTERED DENTAL ASSISTANTS ARE RELATIVELY NEW. AND SO UNFORTUNATELY OUR RESPONSES THAT IF THEY HAVE ESSENTIALLY -- SIGN THE AFFIDAVIT UPON LICENSE RENEWAL THAT THEY HAVE THEIR UNITS ARE REQUIRED UNITS WE ISSUE A CITATION SAYING IN ESSENCE THAT THEY HAVE NOT. EXPRESSED A TRUTHFUL ANSWER IN THAT RESPECT. SO WE'RE WE'RE BEGINNING THE PROCESS OF MONITORING AND AND THE STAFF IS ALSO LOOKING AT TRANS TO FIND OUT WHERE THE PROBLEMS LIE IF PEOPLE ARE TAKING CONTINUING EDUCATION THAT THEY DON'T REALIZE IS NOT BOARD APPROVED -- THEN WE'LL GO AHEAD AND TRY TO DEVELOP -- ESSENTIALLY PERHAPS OF NOTICES ARE ADVISORIES THAT SAY WE'RE FINDING THIS TREND HAPPENING BUT WE ARE CONDUCTING THE THE CONTINUING EDUCATION WE'RE FINDING THAT A LOT OF DOGS EAT THESE CERTIFICATES USE. AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO BE -- TO EDUCATE PEOPLE AS WE GO ALONG BUT WE DO ISSUE CITATIONS FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT COMPLY WELL CERTAINLY IS A LICENSED HEALTH PROFESSIONAL THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE CHALLENGES OF TRACKING YOUR CD -- THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS IS THAT AND AND NOW SINCE IT MAKES NOTE THAT -- AND IT'S MY CLEAR FIGHT THE THE THE BOARD. ACTUALLY REVIEWS AND APPROVES SEE COURSES OR NOT I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T DO YOU DO YOU DO THAT YOURSELF OR DO YOU DIFFER TO USE AN ACCREDITATION AGENCY. WHO BASICALLY -- DECIDES. WHICH SEE IS VALID OR NOT -- FOR PURPOSES OF THE DENTAL BOARD FOR THE PURPOSE OF GENERAL CONTINUING EDUCATION THE BOARD APPROVES PROVIDERS BUT NOT THE INDIVIDUAL COURSES OKAY DO YOU HAVE TO MANDATORY COURSES CURRENTLY FOR THE BOARD ADD TO OUR INFECTION CONTROL AND THE DENTAL PRACTICE ACT COURSE. THOSE PARTICULAR COURSE CONTENT OUTLINES ARE REVIEWED AND APPROVED INDIVIDUALLY BY THE BOARD AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION IS IS THAT IS THERE SOME ENTITY THAT REVIEWS -- STE C. E. FOR WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO SEE PROGRAM THAT'S ACTUALLY CONTINUE EDUCATION IT'S NOT MARKETING SESSION TO SELL SOME KIND OF PRODUCTS -- THAT THEY WANT THEM PROFESSIONAL. TO THEN -- PASS ON TO THEIR PATIENTS. SO IS THERE SOME SORT OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY THE THROUGH THE BOARD ITSELF OR THROUGH SOME OTHER ENTITIES THAT -- YOU DEPEND ON TO SURE THAT THAT'S THAT THE SEEDS APPROPRIATE IF THE BOARDS MADE AWARE OF IN THE SITUATION IT ISSUE WITH THE PROVIDER THAT WE DO THE ANIMAL CONTACT THE PROVIDER AND DISCUSS THAT WITH THEM AND RUN AN INVESTIGATION OF SORTS -- THE PROVIDERS ARE ALSO REQUIREDTO PROVIDE A LIST OF THE COURSES THAT THEY PROVIDED OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS AND I WAS ARE AUDITED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. OKAY AND SO JUST TO CLARIFY SO BASICALLY IS THE BOARD DIRECTLY THAT HAS TO REVIEW WHETHER TO MY TO CONFLICT OF INTEREST ISSUES. AND GONNA TO ASK BECAUSE KNOWING HOW MANY BUT PERCENT OF PEOPLE YOU THOUGHT IT FOR YOU SEE EASE WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE PROVIDERS THEN DO YOU -- I THOUGHT IT TOO SURE THAT THEIR ARMED CONFLICT OF INTEREST PAN FOR THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS I'D SAY THAT IT'S VERY LOW -- BUT EVERY SINGLE PROVIDER IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE COURSE INFORMATION THAT THEY OKAY ARE YOU DEPEND ON OUR PLANES ARE YOU PRACTICALLY AUDITING TO BE SURE A SAMPLE TO BE SURE THAT THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM IN THE SEA. AND THE PROFESSION IT'S A COMBINATION OF BOTH. OKAY SO I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT PERCENTAGE THAT YOU ACTUALLY PRO ACTIVELY AUDIT -- I THINK THAT I WELL I DON'T THINK THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM IN THE DENTAL WORLD HAVING SOME FAMILIARITY WITH IT -- A A A NOTE THAT SOME OF THE OTHER. SPORTS HAVE COME BEFORE US -- DOES DOES SEEM TO BE A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM WHERE THERE'S AN ADEQUATE REVIEW IF THE CONTINUING EDUCATION AND TO ENSURE THE MAIN AND SOME BOARDS ACTUALLY DO HAVE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY WHEN IT COMES TO PROVIDING SEE [inaudible] YES NOW. WE DO NOT HAVE A CAR OKAY I I WOULD URGE THAT THE BOARD CONSIDER THAT -- I THINK IT -- WE NEED TO BE SURE TO THE C. E. THAT WERE REQUIRING MORE MANDATING ON HER VARIOUS PROFESSIONALS ACTUALLY IS ABOUT CONTINUING EDUCATION AND THAT'S NOT. THAT -- THE COURSES THAT THEY TAKE ARE NOT ONES THAT ARE ACTUALLY MORE DESIGNED -- TO MARKET -- FOR THE INTEREST OF THE PERSON WHO'S PRODUCT AND SO FORTH -- SO THIS IS SOMETHING. SO I THINK -- FOR EXAMPLE THE TRADITION COUNCIL ON CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATION -- THAT THE CREDITS -- LICENSING L. A C. -- FOR CME FOR AND IN THE MEDICAL PROFESSION HAS CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICIES I THINK SOME BOARDS DO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT. OF WORDS WHEN IT COMES TO CONTINUE EDUCATION TO HAVE CONFLICT INTEREST POLICIES TO ENSURE THAT THE REQUIRED EDUCATION IS NOT IS ACTUALLY IN THE INTERESTS OF THE PATIENTS. AND AND PATIENTS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF AND NOT IN INTEREST OF THE PERSON WHO'S TEACHING COURSE FOR THEIR FINANCIAL BENEFITS. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN MAY WE CONTACT YOU TO DISCUSS THIS FURTHER BECAUSE THERE REALLY HAS NOT BEEN HONORED READER WE DO ACCEPT -- CONTINUING EDUCATION FROM ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS PACE AND SO WILL LOOK AND TO SEE WHETHER THEY HAVE CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICIES THEMSELVES TO BECAUSE WE DO ACCEPT THEM. BUT THIS IS THE FIRST WE REALLY HAD THIS IF YOU'RE OPEN TO SHARING YOUR INFORMATION WITH WE WE APPRECIATE THEM OF COURSE AND I THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. AT THIS TIME ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON. THANK YOU CHAIR. AS BY THE WAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION IT -- AND THIS COMES THIS IS ALONG THE LINES OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS WHERE IT APPEARS LIKE -- FOLKS THAT ARE PROMOTING OR SPEAKERS THAT ARE PROMOTING COSMETIC PROCEDURES SUCH AS BOTOX OR OR DHARMA FILLERS. ARE ALLOWED TO COME IN BUT OF COURSE DENTIST ON ALLOWED TO DO THE PROCEDURE -- IF I IF I UNDERSTAND THAT CORRECTLY IT APPEARS LIKE THERE'S A BIT OF A DOUBLE STANDARD -- HOW DOES THE BOARD APPROACH THAT AND -- BUT I WOULD IMAGINE THERE PROBABLY ARE SOME DENNIS THAT ARE DOING THAT WHAT'S THE ENFORCEMENT. ON THAT OKAY -- SO THERE ARE DENTISTS THAT IF THEY HAVE AN ELECTED FACIAL COSMETIC SURGERY PERMIT ARE ALLOWED TO PERFORM PROCEDURES RELATING TO CUTS MEDIC USE OF BOTOX. BOTOX IS -- ALLOWED ESSENTIALLY IN THE USE OF GENERAL DENTISTRY. AS LONG AS THE DENTIST DOCUMENTS IN THE DONALD. RECORD ESSENTIALLY WHAT THE USE IS STRICTLY FOR A DENTAL PROCEDURE -- WITH REGARD TO PEOPLE COMING TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TEACHING THE COURSE. THE COURSES ARE OPEN. TO ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO PAY THE FEE AND TAKE THE CLASS. MANY OF THEM ARE ATTENDED BY MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS WHO. IN THEIR OWN RIGHT CAN PERFORM -- CAN USE BOTOX FOR COSMETIC PURPOSES ALSO -- ANY ORAL SURGEONS THAT ARE LICENSED BY THE MEDICAL BOARD AND HAVE A MAN MEDICAL BOARD LICENSE. ARE ABLE TO USE BOTOX IN THE IN THE WAY THAT IN THE SAME WAY THAT BECAUSE THEY ARE CONSIDERED A PHYSICIAN -- AND SURGEON. DOES THAT ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION ALSO WITH THE PROPER STERN GROVE PROPER PERMIT A CERTIFICATION AND NEXUS TO DENTAL PROCEDURES RIGHT THAT PUT THAT CAN BE -- THE PROCEDURES CAN BE DONE YES OKAY THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION AND THEN JUST ONE OTHER QUESTION WHAT IS THE BOARD. BEEN ABLE TO DO TO BE ABLE TO DECREASE -- THE TIME OF INVESTIGATIONS -- ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT ARE THAT ARE -- LAUNCHED AGAINST A DENTIST. OKAY WELL WE ARE WORKING DILIGENTLY ALWAYS TO REVIEW OUR PROCESS IS TO IS TO MAKE SURE THERE IS SUFFICIENT AS WE CAN MAKE THEM WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF IT OF HAVING AN INTERNAL AUDIT THAT WE'RE DOING AMONG OURSELVES TO BE TRACKING. THE TIME FRAMES THAT IT TAKES WE'VE BEEN ALSO WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IN DECREASING OUR TIME LINES FROM THE TIME THAT OUR COMPLAINT INVESTIGATION. GOES TO TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND WE SEE AN IMPROVEMENT IN THAT AREA SO. OUR NUMBERS HAVE COME DOWN SINCE OUR LAST TEST SENSOR REVIEW NOT AS QUICKLY AS WE ALL WOULD HOPE BUT WE CERTAINLY ARE WORKING DILIGENTLY. IN THAT EFFORT -- TO TRY TO RESPOND TO CONSUMERS AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND IF THERE'S MORE AS FAR AS QUESTIONS CONCERNS ALL REACH OUT. THANK YOU SOMEONE THREE THANK YOU VERY MUCH A DIGITAL QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME FROM ANY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE.

IN THE PORTFOLIO EXAMINATION AND AND IF I COULD JUST SAY A COUPLE WORDS ABOUT THAT. OF CALIFORNIA WAS THE FIRST TO INTRODUCE. A NON. SINGLE EVENT PATIENT RELATED LICENSING EXAMINATION FOR DENTISTRY IN THE UNITED STATES. I WAS -- ABOUT EIGHT YEARS AGO. THAT HAS STARTED A MOVEMENT ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN IN SEPTEMBER OF LAST YEAR A JOINT. TASK FORCE COMPOSED OF MEMBERS OF THE AMERICAN DENTAL ASSOCIATION THE AMERICAN DENTAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION AND AMERICAN STUDENT ASSOCIATION. ISSUED A TASK FORCE REPORT. IN SUMMARY THAT TASK FORCE REPORT RECOMMENDED NUMBER ONE DOING AWAY WITH THAT THE SINGLE ENCOUNTER. PATIENT OF BASED EXAMINATION POST GRADUATION. IN ITS PLACE. TO IMPLEMENT A CURRICULUM IN CALIFORNIA PORTFOLIO AS AN EXAMPLE. AS TO WHAT THAT IS WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN. COUNTRYWIDE THE THIRD RECOMMENDATION WAS TO INCREASE THE PORTABILITY OF LICENSES BETWEEN STATES. THAT'S ONE OF THE MAJOR CONCERNS AT THIS POINT WITH THE PORTFOLIO EXAMINATION IS. THAT AT THE PRESENT TIME. IN ADDITION TO CALIFORNIA THERE ARE TEN STATES. THAT EXCEPT TO THE RESULTS OF THAT LICENSING EXAMINATION. THE OTHERS DO NOT. SO ONE OF THE MAJOR PROBLEMS AND CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE. IN MODERNIZING THE LICENSE YOUR INITIAL LICENSURE AS WELL AS PORTABILITY IS TO GET STATE BOARDS IN LINE WITH GETTING OFFERS THEIR TRADITION. OF THE PATIENT BASED CLINICAL EXAMINATION WHICH IS BEEN THE STANDARD FOR YEARS AND THE MODERNIZE THAT PROCESS. THAT EXAMINATION. HAS NOT DEMONSTRATED VALIDITY OR RELIABILITY TO ANY SUCCESSFUL EXTENT.

WE REQUIRE EIGHT YEARS OF TRAINING AND EDUCATION EXPERIENCE IN ARCHITECTURAL WORK. WHICH INCLUDES THE STRUCTURE TRAINING. EXPERIENCE PROGRAM CONSISTING OF NEARLY FOUR THOUSAND HOURS ACROSS SIX PRACTICE AREAS. CANDIDATES MUST ALSO PASS A SIX DIVISIONAL A SIX DIVISION NATIONAL EXAM. FINALLY IN RECOGNITION OF CALIFORNIA'S UNIQUE SEISMIC ENERGY ACCESSIBILITY FAR PREVENTION AND LEGAL STANDARDS. WITH MINISTER CALIFORNIA'S SUPPLEMENTAL WHICH WE CALL CST. TO ASSESS A CANDIDATE'S ABILITY TO SAFELY PRACTICE AND OUR UNIQUE AND DYNAMIC CONTEXT. ONE COMPONENT OF OUR STANDARDS IS THAT WE ARE VERY PROUD OF IS OUR MULTIPLE PATHWAYS INTO THE PROFESSION.

FOR EDUCATION OR EXPERIENCE OR A COMBINATION THEREOF. THE BOARD'S INVOKED THE ENFORCER PROGRAM WORKS WHAT POTENTIALLY WITH BUILDING DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT. THE BOARDS BUILDING OFFICIAL CONT -- CONTRACT PROGRAM IN ADDITION TO CONSUMER EDUCATION. THE BOARD WORKS CLOSELY WITH PROFESSIONAL GROUPS TO ENSURE THAT ARCHITECTS UNDERSTAND CHANGES IN LAWS CODES AND STANDARDS. ALL THESE INITIATIVES UNDERSCORE THE BORE THE BOARD'S FIRM BELIEF THAT IT MUST BE BOTH. STRATEGIC AN AGGRESSIVE.

MOST SOME DO NOT PASSED THE FIRST TIME -- IT JUST THE WAY IT IS THEY NEED TO RETAKE THE CALIFORNIA SUPPLEMENTAL EXAM FROM HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS. TO NINETY DAYS AND THAT'S WAS RESPONSE TO A LOT OF REQUESTS FOR THAT TO HAPPEN. AND THEN WE RECENTLY BEGAN TO ACCEPT ONLINE CREDIT CARD PAYMENTS FOR LICENSE RENEWALS FINALLY. WE ARE IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND WE FINALLY DID IT. SO WITH THAT I'M GOING TO INTRODUCE MR TRUSCOTT TO PROVIDE THE OVERVIEW FOR THE LA T. C.. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS MARK TRUSCOTT AND I'M CHAIRMAN OF THE LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTS TECHNICAL COMMITTEE. AND I'VE SERVED ON THE COMMITTEES SINCE SEPTEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE LA T. C. IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EXAMINATION LICENSURE AND ENFORCEMENT PROGRAMS CONCERNING LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTS. LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTS ARE THE DESIGN PROFESSIONALS WHO SHAPE THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT FOR PRESERVATION AND HUMAN YEARS. IN A MANNER WHICH PROTECTS THE HEALTH SAFETY [inaudible] AND WELFARE. THE ONLY TO SEE IS A FIVE MEMBER TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD. CONSISTING OF LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTS. THE BOARD OF LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTS I'M SORRY THE BOARD OF LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTS WAS CREATED. BY THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE IN. NINETEEN FIFTY THREE AND THE LA T. C. WAS LATER ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN TO REPLACE THE BOARD OF LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTS. IN THE LAST REPORT THE LA T. C. EXPANDED PATHWAYS TO LICENSURE BY ALLOWING EDUCATION CREDIT FOR AN ARCHITECTURE DEGREE. PARTIAL COMPLETION OF A LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE DEGREE AND PARTIAL COMPLETION OF A EXTENT AN EXTENSION CERTIFICATE AND LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE. SINCE THEN THE LA TO SEE CONTINUE TO REDUCE BARRIERS TO LICENSURE. AND APPROVED ALLOWING CREDIT FOR RELATED DEGREES BOTTLE OR IT AND ASSOCIATE. NON RELATED DEGREES BOTTLER IT AN ASSOCIATE. AND AN EXPERIENCE ONLY PATHWAY. WE LICENSE APPROXIMATELY. THREE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTS HAVE A BUDGET OF ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS AND A DEDICATED STAFF OF FIVE WE ALSO HAVE EXTERNAL CONTRACTS WITH TO LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTS CONSULTANTS FOR OUR ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM TO ASSIST WITH THE TECHNICAL REVIEW. OF CASES INVOLVING A PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE ISSUES. LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTS OFFER IN A SOCIAL ESSENTIAL ARRAY OF TALENT AND EXPERTISE TO DEVELOP THE AND IMPLEMENT SOLUTIONS FOR THE BILL TO NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. HAS WITH THE BOARD THE LA T. C. HAS FOUND THAT ACTING PREVENTED TO FLEE. AND PROACTIVELY IS THE BEST USE OF ITS RESOURCES. TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS ARE LIGHT IT'S REQUIRED TOTAL OF SIX YEARS OF EXPERIENCE. AND OR EDUCATION. IN ADDITION CANDIDATES MUST PASS A FOR SECTION NATIONAL EXAM ALONG WITH THE CALIFORNIA SUPPLEMENTAL EXAMINATION. TO ASSESS THE CANDIDATE'S ABILITY. TO SAFELY PRACTICE IN OUR DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT. WHAT'S CHANGED SINCE THE LAST REVIEW. IN ADDITION TO EXPANDING PATHWAYS THE LA T. C. HAS REVAMPED ITS WEBSITE INCLUDING INCORPORATING THE DCA SEARCH TOOL THAT ENABLES CONSUMERS TO SEARCH FOR ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. IN REAL TIME AND IS IN THE PROCESS OF LAUNCHING ONLINE CREDIT. RENEWAL PAYMENTS IN MAY WHICH WERE VERY EXCITED ABOUT ALSO. NOW MRS INDIGO WILL PRESENT THEIR RESPONSES TO THE ISSUES AND QUESTIONS FOR THE BOARD AND LA T. C.. THANK YOU WERE AT WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO THOSE RESPONSES JUST A NOTE THAT IF USED UP A LOT OF YOUR TIME JUST IN THE OVERVIEW SEE OF ABOUT SIX MINUTES TO GO TO THE ISSUE SO PLEASE. BE CONCISE THE MORNING GLORIES IN A EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR THE BOARD ON THE FIRST ISSUE EVEN ASKED ADDRESS IS NUMBER THREE ON FINGERPRINTING. THE COMMITTEE NOTES THAT CURRENTLY OUR LICENSEES ARE ONLY REQUIRED TO SELF DISCLOSE HOW CAN THE BOARD BE CERTAIN THEY'RE NOT MISSING ANY INFORMATION. APPLICANTS ARE REQUIRED TO SIGN THE APPLICATION -- PENALTY OF PERJURY -- BUT WE WE CERTAINLY CAN BE CERTAIN THAT WE'RE NOT MISSING ANY INFORMATION SO WE'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND ALL OF THAT -- COMMITTEES DIRECTION ON WHETHER OR NOT YOU WOULD LIKE THE BOARD TO BEGIN FINGERPRINT APPLICANTS -- ISSUE NUMBER FOUR IS INFORMAL LICENSE CONFERENCES -- THE COMMITTEE PROPOSES TO ALLOW AT THE EXACT OPPOSITE TO DELEGATE THIS AUTHORITY CURRENTLY THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER CAN HOLD AN INFORMAL CONFERENCE WITH THAT LICENSEES RECEIVED A CITATION WHICH HAPPENS FREQUENTLY -- WE'RE ASKING FOR THE ABILITY FOR THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER TO BE ABLE TO DELEGATE THIS TO THE MOST LIKELY WOULD BE OUR SYSTEM EXECUTIVE OFFICER. AND IT WOULD JUST BE AM IN THE INSTANCE WHEN THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER IS UNAVAILABLE OR IF THERE'S A CONFLICT OF INTEREST IF THE EXACT OFFICER NEW EITHER THE PARTIES THAT WERE PARTICIPATING IN THE CONFERENCE. SO WE WOULD -- WE ARE THE BOARD HAS DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES -- AND ARE REGULATIONS THAT THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER MUST FOLLOW AND HOLDING THE CONFERENCE AND WHOEVER AT THE AUTHORITY IS DELEGATED TO WHAT FOLLOW THOSE SAME REQUIREMENTS -- THE THIRD ISSUE -- WE'VE BEEN ASKED ADDRESSES NUMBER SIX THE WRITTEN CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS THE BOARD PROPOSING TO MAKE A FEW MODIFICATIONS TO OUR EXISTING WRITTEN CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS -- THE COMMITTEE ASKED HOW LONG WITHOUT THEIR CONTRACTS -- FOR CHANGES SO -- WE DO THINK IT MIGHT BE ADVISABLETO DELAY IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW REQUIREMENTS UNTIL JULY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY TO GIVE. ADEQUATE TIME TO NOTIFY LICENSEES -- WE WOULD BEGIN EDUCATING THEM AS SOON AS THEY REQUIREMENTS ARE ADOPTED WE DO -- AT EMAIL LISTSERVS WERE LICENSEES AND WE ALSO PARTNER WITH OUR ASSOCIATION TO DO ADDITIONAL OUTREACH TO ENSURE THAT THEY WERE AWARE OF THE NEW REQUIREMENTS. I'M GOING TO MOVE INTO THE ISSUES FOR THE LA T. C. -- THE FIRST ISSUE IS ALSO IS SIMILAR IT'S ISSUE NUMBER TWO FOR WRITTEN CONTRACTS -- THE LA TO SEE IS GOING TO USE -- UNDERTAKE AND LATER THIS YEAR OCCUPATIONAL ANALYSIS FOR THERE ARE CALIFORNIA SUPPLEMENTAL EXAM AS PART OF THAT THEY DO OUT REACH ALL OF THEIR LICENSEES TO SURVEY THEM SO WE WOULD INCLUDE. NOTIFICATION THE REQUIREMENTS AS PART OF THAT SURVEY BUT WOULD ALSO AGAIN SUGGEST THAT WE CAN CONSIDER DELAYING IMPLEMENTATION UNTIL JULY ONE FOR IT TO ALLOW ADEQUATE TIME FOR OUTREACH. AND THEN THE LAST QUESTION FOR ELLIE T. C. IS ISSUE NUMBER THREE THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER DUTIES -- THE BOARD AND I LIKE TO SEE YOU TRY -- TO HAVE SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS AND PROCEDURES IN PLACE -- AND SO WE NOTED THAT THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER IS NOT ALLOWED TO APPROVE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS FOR REVOCATION OR SURRENDER OF A LICENSE. FOR THE LAT SEAT WHILE THE DETECT OFFICER THAT HAPPEN VERY OFTEN IN THE PAST THREE YEARS THE LEDS TIAS HAD ONE REVOCATION AND ONE SURRENDER -- BUT JUST KNOW THAT THIS WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRY -- TO MAKE THE REQUIREMENTS SIMILAR TO THE BOARDS AND WOULD ALLOW THE PROCESS TO MOVE A LITTLE LITTLE BIT MORE QUICKLY THERE'S NOT A LONG DELAY -- BUT IT DOES HAVE TO WAIT FOR A QUARTERLY BOARD MEETING FOR ACTION CURRENTLY [inaudible] THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH LOOKING TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT THEY MAY HAVE. A CENTER ARCHULETA. GOOD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MATTER PRESIDENT IF I MAY. SAY THANK YOU TO YOUR YOURSELF WHEN YOU'RE BORED WITH SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT CONSUMERS OBVIOUSLY HAVE IN TODAY'S WORLD THE UNLICENSED PRACTICING. OF PEOPLE WHO PROFESS TO BE ARCHITECTS THAT'S AN ISSUE OUT THERE THE AS THE ACTIVITY INCREASED OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS -- IN ALSO THE FACT THAT -- HOW DO WE HANDLE THOSE COMPLAINTS AND -- RECTIFY AND WITH THAT WITH THAT CONSUMER. AND THEN I'M GOING TO ADD ONE OTHER CRITICS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN -- TO ENCOURAGE EVERY CITY TO GO OUT AND START LOOKING TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND CONSTRUCTION OF LARGE PROJECTS. SHOULD ONE OF THE FIVE ARCHITECTS BE AN EXPERT IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF SUCH PROJECTS. MAY I ASK FOR ANSWER THE SECOND PART AND THEN I WILL ASK NATO. TO ADDRESS THE FIRST PART -- YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING -- I HAPPEN TO BE. AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. OUR PROTECTIVE AMONGST OTHER THINGS BUT YOU'RE RIGHT IT HAPPENS [inaudible] TO BE COINCIDENTAL. AND NOW WITH THE EMPHASIS ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING I THINK IT IT'S NOT A BAD IDEA AT ALL -- IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD CHECK IN WITH THE APPOINTMENTS OFFICE. TO SAY HERE THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF ARCHITECTS THAT WE KNOW AROUND THE STATE THAT HAVE THE SIX EXPERTISE. AND THEREFORE MAYBE THEY SHOULD COME TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE STATE IN ORDER -- TO PROMOTE. THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- AND AND DEAL WITH THE CRISIS BECAUSE I'M SURE EVERY CITY MUNICIPALITIES OUT THERE IT'S LIKE TO WORK WITH THE ARCHITECT THAT HAVE THE EDUCATION THE FEEL OF THE EXPERIENCE. IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SO THAT'S IMPORTANT AND IF YOU WILL GO ON TO THE NEXT QUESTION ABOUT. THE THE UNLICENSED AND I BELIEVE THAT OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS THAT WE'VE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN LIGHT OF MY SELECTIVITY BUT IT IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE MAIN -- COMPLAINTS THAT WE GET IT IS IN REGARDS ON LICENSE ACTIVITY -- SO WE DO TRY TO DO OUTREACH TO CONSUMERS SO THEY'RE AWARE OF THE REQUIREMENTS AND THERE IS AN EXEMPTION THE LAW. FOR A SINGLE FAMILY HOUSING BUT WE TRY TO EDUCATE CONSUMERS AS TO WHEN AN ARCHITECT IS REQUIRED BUT THEY SHOULD LOOK FOR IN CHOOSING AN ARCHITECT -- AND SOMETHING WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON AND DO ADDITIONAL OUTREACH. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT -- GREAT -- APPRECIATE YOUR WORK AND WHAT YOU DO FOR THE COMMUNITY AS FAR AS ARCHITECTS AND LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTS. AN ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN PROBABLY AND AT LEAST MY DISTRICT. ARE EIGHTY A ISSUES. AND ISSUES WHERE PLANS HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED THE BUILDER -- HAS RECEIVED THE PERMIT THE PLANTS BEEN APPROVED. THE WORK HAS BEEN DONE ACCORDING TO SPEC TO FIND OUT THAT. A WHETHER IT BE MONTHS OR YEARS LATER A LAWSUIT IS FILED BECAUSE OF EIGHTY EIGHT VIOLATIONS. AND I KNOW IT IS ADDRESSED -- IN THE MATERIAL HERE WHAT IS -- WHAT IS THE ANSWER WHAT CAN YOU DO TO HELP -- AFFECTED LEE -- BRING AWARENESS TO THE ARCHITECTS AS FAR AS ADA. COMPLIANCE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PLANS ARE ACCURATE. AND THE BUILDERS AND THOSE THAT ARE BENEFITING FROM THAT PERMIT AND IN THEIR PROJECT ARE NOT IN VIOLATION. AND DON'T GET SUED. I WAS MARK TRUSCELLO AGAINST LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT DAY IN THE PROFESSIONAL WORLD ENGINEERS LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTS ARCHITECTS ALL LOOK AT EIGHTY A ISSUES SO WHAT IT'S ACTUALLY I I THINK THAT -- IT'S GETTING A LOT BETTER THAN I WAS SAY THIRTY YEARS AGO IN TERMS OF ACCESSIBILITY. I WOULD STATE TO THE AND SILICON. FOLLOW UP ON THIS BUT THE ARCHITECTS THEMSELVES GO TO A VERY RIGOROUS CAST -- TRAINING SCENARIO WHERE THEY HAVE. TO BE CERTIFIED RIGHT AND YOU CAN PICK UP ON NOT THAT'S RIGHT WELL FIRST OF ALL WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET A BUILDING PERMIT. UNLESS ALL THE ADA ISSUES ARE ADDRESSED. SO THAT'S THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE. AND MARK MARK IS REFERRING TO IS THE CAST CERTIFICATION WHICH IS A VERY HIGH LEVEL SPECIALIZED -- CERTIFICATION FOR ARCHITECTS WHO ARE -- EXPERTS REAL EXPERTS BUT I WOULD I WOULD REALLY. PUT MY STICK MY NECK OUT HERE AND SAY THAT WE CAN'T GET A PERMIT -- I ACTUALLY HAD AN INCIDENT MIGHT ONE PROJECT IN MIND WHERE WE WERE OFF ONE INCH. IN HEIGHT AND THE BUILDING INSPECTOR ACTUALLY MANAGED TO REDO THE FLOORING SO THAT IT LINED ONE INCH. SO -- I THINK THAT WITH KALBA WHICH IS THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF BUILDING OFFICIALS WE ARE VERY COOPERATIVE IS SOMETIMES CONTENTIOUS RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE THEY DO WATCH EVERY INCH. YEAH SO I'M NOT TOO WORRIED ABOUT THAT -- IN IN THE SENSE OF OUR APPROVALS PROCEDURES THAT HAPPENS. I THINK PRETTY RIGOROUSLY. OKAY AND I I APPRECIATE THAT. I ALSO HAVE ONE THING TO THAT. FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS -- ARCHITECTS OF HAD CANOEING EDUCATION IN ACCESS -- REQUIREMENTS AND EIGHTY EIGHT AND SO WE WOULD CONTINUE TO SEE I THINK IMPROVEMENTS WITH -- THE REQUIREMENTS SIMPLY FEEL RIGHT I THINK THAT WAS THE ANSWER I WAS LOOKING -- FOR NOT NO WORRIES BECAUSE OF A BUILDER INSPECTORS INVOLVED THAT MEANS A PERMIT WAS ISSUED. AT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT -- SO AS FAR AS THE CONTINUING EDUCATION BECAUSE THERE ARE LAWS THAT CHANGE DIFFERENT THINGS HAPPEN. AND SO THERE IS PURSUE THEY HAVE -- TO EVERY TWO YEARS NEED TO COMPLETE FIVE HOURS AND DISABILITY ACCESS REQUIREMENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANSWERS WELL I APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU SELLING THE GRAYSON -- CENTER PAN. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH AT THE FIRST OF ALL I AGREE WITH YOUR DECISION NOT TO FINGERPRINT EVERYONE APPLIES I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT HELPS -- THE I DID DEVON BRIEF QUESTION -- REGARDING BREEZE -- EX I UNDERSTAND THAT -- IS THAT -- YOU'RE NOT ON BREEZE -- FOR LOTS OF GOOD REASONS AND BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO PAY FOR IT -- SO -- MAYBE YOU CAN TELL ME DID YOU EVER HAVE TO HAVE TO RAISE FEES TO COVER THIS THING -- THIS -- EXPENSE OR DID YOU BECAUSE YOU SPEND MONEY HAD TO PROVIDE MONEY FOR THIS -- PROGRAMS THAT -- SYSTEM THAT YOU. DO NOT MEET YOUR NEEDS. ARE WE HAVE NOT HAD TO RAISE FEES TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS TO PAPER BREEZE UP FOR EITHER PROGRAM -- I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANYTHING THAT WE HAD TO FORGO DOING I'VE ONLY BEEN WITH THE BOARD SINCE LAST YEAR AS INDICATED -- SO I'M NOT AWARE THAT THERE'S ANY LARGE PROJECT THAT WE HAD TO FORGO AT THIS POINT -- SO WE ARE AT ONE OF THE PHASE THREE PROGRAM SO WE'RE CURRENTLY UNDERGOING OUR BUSINESS MODERNIZATION PROCESS AND COMPLETING OUR MAPPING TO DETERMINE WHAT MIGHT COME FORWARD. SO WE DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE COSTS WILL BE FOR A NEW SYSTEM IF WE WOULD NEED A FEE INCREASE OR ANY -- BCP NO I I APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER MY CONCERN ABOUT BREEZES AND BOTH ON BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE HEARS A MEMBER IAN T.. AS IS THAT. IT. THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES BOB IS VERY PROBLEMATIC AND UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE THE COST OF THIS PROBLEM. IS BASICALLY JUST PASSED ON TO LICENSEES. NOT THE GENERAL FUND -- BASICALLY PEOPLE AND YEAH MAYBE IT'S NOT SUCH A BIG DEAL BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHY. WE'VE -- WASTED TAXPAYER MONEY EXCEPT I WOULD SAY THAT PEOPLE PAY FEES FOR LICENSES WHEN THEY'RE PAYING FOR THINGS THAT DON'T WORK -- THAT'S A FORM OF A TWO YEAR TAX AND I THINK WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THANK YOU.

AND WE WILL PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS TO PROVIDE SOME. COMMENTS. AFTER YOUR PRESENTATION PLEASE PRESENT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. GOOD MORNING HONORABLE CHAIRS MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND STAFF. MY NAME IS MOHAMMAD QURESHI I'M A PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER AND THE CURRENT PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD. WITH ME TODAY ARE RICK MORE THE BOARDS THAT COULD'VE OFFICER NANCY EYES ALERT THE ASSISTANT EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND ANDREW HAMILTON PUBLIC MEMBER OF THE BOARD. WE APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE TO THE COMMITTEE ON OUR BOARD. DURING THE LAST FOUR YEARS AS WELL AS PRESENT OUR PLANS FOR THE FUTURE. LICENSING OF LAND SURVEYORS BEGAN IN EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE STATE'S SURVEYOR GENERAL. LICENSING OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND THE REGULATION OF THE PRACTICE OF CIVIL ENGINEERING BEGAN IN. NINETEEN TWENTY NINE WITH THE CREATION OF THE BOARD OF REGISTRATION FOR CIVIL ENGINEERS. FOLLOWING THE FAILURE OF THE STAIN FRANCIS DAM. EVEN IF IT IS KILEY GET INTO YOUR OF YOUR THE BOARD -- HAS SUBMITTED THIS INFORMATION TO TO US AND SO -- WE FORGET DIRECTLY INTO THE ISSUES THAT WE CAN BE EXPEDITIOUS OURS BUT I HEART THAT I WILL TURN IT OVER TO THE IS IT. ASSISTANT AT THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER IN THE SYSTEM THANK YOU FOR THE LONG TERM FUND COMMISSION. THE BOARDS EXPENDITURES HAVE INCREASED OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS BY AN AVERAGE ABOUT 8% PER YEAR. THIS IS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF STAFF GENERAL INCREASES AND SALARY AND BENEFITS FOR ALL STAFF. AWFULLY EXPENDITURE EXPENDITURES RELATING TO EXAMINATION DEVELOPMENT AND PRO RATHER. WHICH IN ITSELF HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY INCREASES EMPLOYEE STAFFS AND BENEFITS. THE BOARD RECOGNIZES THAT IF THE FISCAL STRUCTURE REMAINS UNCHANGED IT WILL ENCOUNTER A DEFICIT BEGINNING FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY TWENTY ONE ADDITIONALLY SINCE THE MERGER OF THE GEOLOGISTS GEOPHYSICISTS COUNT WITH THE BOARD THE ENGINEERS A SERVER IS FUN THE BOARD HAS RECOGNIZED THE FEES CHARGED TO THE DIFFERENT PROFESSIONS. ARE REQUIRES SO A LITTLE BIT MORE STANDARDIZATION. THE BOARD DIRECTED STAFF TO CONDUCT A REVIEW OF SERVICES PROVIDED -- SUCH AS LICENSE YOUR APPLICATION PROCESS EXAM DEVELOPMENT FORSMAN NEW A PROCESSING. AND TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE FEES IT SHOULD BE CHARGE FOR THESE SERVICES TO SUPPORT OVERALL OPERATIONS. AT THE NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN MEETING THE BOARD APPROVED STAFF'S PROPOSED THREE REVISIONS TO REGULATIONS. THAT SPECIFIED EXACT FEES TO BE PAID TO THE BOARD FOR THE SERVICES. STAFF IS PREPARING THE TO INITIATE THAT RULE MAKING PROCESS TO AMEND OF FEES WHAT THE GOAL TO DO FEES WILL BE IMPLEMENTED BY JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY THE BOARD EXPECTS TO REVIEW THE FEE STRUCTURE WITHIN THREE YEARS BEYOND THAT EFFECTIVE DATE -- SO AS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ANY NEW EFFICIENCIES EXPECTED THERE WAS AS A RESULT OF OUR BUSINESS MODERNIZATION EFFORTS. ISSUE TWO LICENSE PROCESS TIME LINES -- THERE'S FOUR MAJOR MILESTONES. THAT LICENSEES ARE CANDIDATES FOR LICENSURE MUST REACH OUR MUST SATISFY TO COME LICENSES ENGINEER SURVEYOR OR GEOLOGIST IN CALIFORNIA. TYPICALLY THOSE ARE TWO ACQUIRED RECKLESS AND EDUCATION EXPERIENCE PASS UP TO TWO NATIONAL EXAMS APPLY FOR LICENSURE WITH THE BOARD AND PASS AN APPLET APPLICABLE STATE EXAMS. SINCE THE LAST SUNSET REVIEW THE BOARD HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN SEPARATING THE REQUIRED EXAMINATION CRITERIA FROM THE LICENSE YOUR APPLICATION PROCESS. NOW A POTENTIAL CANDIDATE FOR LICENSURE ONLY APPLIES TO THE BOARD ONCE THE EVER ALREADY ACQUIRED EXPERIENCE AND EDUCATION AND AFTER THEY'VE PASSED THE APPROPRIATE NATIONAL EXAMS. FURTHERMORE THAT WE WILL THE BOARD BELIEVES THAT THIS ALLOWS THE APPLICANT. TO FEAR WILL PREPARE TO TAKE THE NATIONAL EXAM NGUYEN THERE ARE WHEN THEY WANT TO WHEN THEY BELIEVE THEY'RE READY AND THEY NO LONGER MUST WAIT FOR THE BOARDS APPLICATION PROCESS TO THIS CHANGE THE BOARD ONLY. ONLY DIRECTLY INFLUENCES TO IN A MAJOR MILESTONES MENTIONED. THOSE RARE PRUE OF AN APPLICANT FOR LICENSURE UPON RECEIPT OF A COMPLETE APPLICATION AND THEN OFFERING THE STATE EXAM SO WHERE THOSE ARE REQUIRE. THE BOARD DOES HAVE THEM PUT ON THERE ARE FOR THE NATIONAL EXAMS BUT DOES NOT DIRECTLY INFLUENCE WINNER HOW OFTEN THEY ARE OFFERED. FOR ENGINEERS AND SURVEYORS APPROXIMATELY ONE THIRD OF THE NATIONAL EXAMS ARE CURRENTLY OFFERED VIA. COMPUTER BASED TESTING. EXAM THAT HIGH DEMAND HI POPULATIONS. ARE OR WILL BE OFFERED ON A YEAR ROUND BASIS WHILE EXAMS WITH LESS OF A DEMAND WILL CONTINUE TO BE OFFERED ON SELECT DATES NATIONWIDE. ALL EXAMS FOR ENGINEERS LANCERS NATIONAL EXAMS ARE EXPECTED BE CONVERTED TO COMPUTER BASED TESTING MY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR GEOLOGIST EXAMS ARE STILL PRIMARILY OFFER TWICE A YEAR ON PAPER. THE BOARD IS ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN LEADERSHIP LEVEL WITH AS BOG THE NATIONAL SO ORGANIZATION THAT DEVELOPS THE NATIONAL GEOLOGY EXAMINATIONS. TO DEVELOP -- IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR TRANSITION OF THESE NATIONAL EXAMS TO COMPUTER BASED TESTING. IN TERMS OF THE APPLICATION PROCESS WITH THE PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED CHANGES THE BOARD HAS ESTABLISHMENT TERRIBLE TOWARDS NOTIFYING APPLICANT OF ACCEPTABILITY OR INCOMPLETE. WITHIN A THIRTY DAYTIME FRAME AFTER RECEIPT OF THE APPLICATION. CURRENTLY THIS CHANGES IN THE PROCESS IS RESULTING IN A TIME FRAME OF BETWEEN THIRTY TO SIXTY DAYS ON AVERAGE AND IS HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY THE BOARDS RELIANCE ON OUTDATED APPLICATION LICENSING DATABASE SYSTEM. IN ADDITION THE BOARD REGULARLY CONDUCTS NEVER GET OUT REACHING A NEW PROCESS AS WELL AS HELPING OUT KANSEN SURE APPLICATIONS ARE COMPLETE. WHEN IT INCOMPLETE APPLICATION IS RECEIVED BOARD WORKS DIRECTLY WITH THE APPLICANT TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY INFORMATION SO THAT THEY CAN COMPLETE THE APPLICATION? THROUGH THE EVENTUAL ACCUSATION ACQUISITION OF A NEW COMPREHENSIVE APPLICATION LICENSE AND SYSTEM THAT IS CURRENTLY UNDER REVIEW BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY. AND BY REGULAR PROCESS VERIFICATION OR IMPROVEMENT VALIDATION THE MORE THAN TWO SO BATES ABILITY TO ACHIEVE ITS -- INTERNAL TIME FRAME GOALS. UPON APPLICATION REVIEW REVIEW APPROVAL SOME APPLICANTS MAY BE REQUIRED TO PASS THE STATE SPECIFIC EXAM UNIQUE CALIFORNIA PRACTICE. CURRENTLY ALL STATE SPECIFIC EXAMS DEVELOP BY TOWARD OUR OFFER BY COMPUTER BASED TESTING HAVE BEEN SINCE. TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THIS PROJECT PROVIDES A CANDY WOULD FLEXIBILITY AND CONVENIENCE OF SCHEDULING EXAMINE A TIME LOCATION OF THEIR CHOOSING WHILE ALSO ENSURING THAT SECURITY IN EXAMINATION OUR STANDARDIZATION EXAMS ARE SECURE. THOSE HIGHER DEMAND EXAMS ARE OFFERED YEAR ROUND WHILE THE REMAINING ONES ARE AGAIN OFFER ONCE OR TWICE A YEAR TO PUT ON SPECIFIC DATES AND LEVELS OF DEMAND. FOR MANY OF THE BOARD'S APPLICANTS SEEKING A LICENSE THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE STATE EXAMINATION COMPONENT. THE APPLICATION PROCESS IS NOW THE FINAL STEP IN MY CENTER. THESE CHANGES MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY RESULTED IN LICENSES NOW BE AN ISSUE BY THE BOARD UP TO TWICE A MONTH RATHER THAN TWICE A YEAR AND A PASSED. CONSEQUENTLY THE BOARD FEELS THAT IS TAKEN SIGNIFICANT MEASURES TO THE STREAMLINED THE STEPS TO ACHIEVE LICENSURE. THERE ARE UNDER ITS CONTROL AND INFLUENCE. OF AND WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO NANCY EYES RESISTING SECOND OFFICER TO ADDRESS ISSUE FOR NINETY FIVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- ISSUE NUMBER FOUR RELATES TO ENFORCEMENT TIME LINES AND WE WILL PROVIDE. COMPLETE DETAILED RESPONSE IN A WRITTEN RESPONSE REGARDING ALL OF THE AREAS OF OUR ENFORCEMENT PROCESS BUT TODAY I WANT TO FOCUS ON THE BOARDS COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS DIVISION OF INVESTIGATION. FOR DO BY ON THE CASES THAT WE REFER TO THEM FOR INVESTIGATION. AND THE OVERALL H. AVERAGE AGE OF THE BOARD'S INVESTIGATIONS HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY DISSED DECREASED SINCE LAST SUNSET REVIEW. AND THE TIME LINES HAVE REMAINED FAIRLY CONSTANT OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT ALL CASES ARE INVESTIGATED BY THE BOARD'S ENFORCEMENT UNIT STAFF WHO ARE ANALYSTS AND NOT FIELD INVESTIGATORS. ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF THOSE CASES ARE REFERRED TO DFI TO ASSIST THE BOARD STAFF WITH THE INVESTIGATION. HOWEVER THE CASES THAT ARE REFERRED TO DE OF I'D SCALE OF OUR OVERALL CASES. TYPICALLY THE CASES THAT ARE REFERRED TO DEVALUE Và OF ALLEGATIONS RELATING TO UNLICENSED ACTIVITY. SUCH AS ON LICENSE INDIVIDUALS OPERATING BUSINESSES WITHOUT AN APPROPRIATELY LICENSED PERSON AND RESPONSIBLE CHARGE OF THE BUSINESS OPERATIONS. AS WELL AS MORE SERIOUS CASES WHERE I LICENSE PEOPLE ARE POSING AS LICENSEES. DID OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE BOARDS LAWS REGARDING HIM MAY OFFER PROFESSIONAL SERVICES EXACTLY WHAT SERVICES REQUIRE LICENSURE AND HOW BUSINESSES MUST BE STRUCTURED. THERE ARE NUANCES THAT MAYBE OVERLOOKED BY INVESTIGATORS WHO ARE NOT FULLY VERSED ON OUR LAWS. OTHER CASES REFERRED TO THE OF AYE INVOLVE THOSE REPORTS STAFF LACKS SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO LOCATE INDIVIDUALS AND OBTAIN DOCUMENTS. GIVE AYE HAS THESE RESOURCES TO LOCATE THE INDIVIDUALS AND CONDUCT IN PERSON RATE INTERVIEWS. AS WELL AS OBTAINING DOCUMENTS FROM INDIVIDUALS PRIVATE BUSINESSES AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. BECAUSE OF THE TECHNICAL NATURE OF OUR PROFESSIONS LAY PEOPLE INCLUDING TRAINED INVESTIGATORS. MAY NOT BE FAMILIAR WITH THE TERMINOLOGY IS FOR THE TYPES OF DOCUMENTS PRODUCED. THESE ISSUES WHILE UNDERSTANDABLE CAN LEAD TO PROLONGED INVESTIGATIONS DUE TO THE NEED FOR CLARIFICATION AND FOLLOW AT IN DISCUSSIONS WITH T. OF MY STAFF IT WAS AGREED THAT IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO THEIR INVESTIGATORS. FOR BOARD STAFF TO PROVIDE TRAINING REGARDING SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF OUR LAWS AND THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF OUR PROFESSIONS. SO THAT THE INVESTIGATORS WOULD HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THESE ISSUES BEFORE BEGINNING THEIR INVESTIGATION. BOARD STAFF IS WORKING WITH DIVIDE TO DEVELOP THE TRAINING WITH THE GOAL OF PRESENTING IT TO THE INVESTIGATORS IN THE LATE SPRING OR EARLY SUMMER OF THIS YEAR. NOW I WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FIVE REGARDING ENFORCEMENT AGAINST UNLICENSED ACTIVITY AGAIN WE WILL PROVIDE A MUCH MORE DETAILED WRITTEN RESPONSE BUT TODAY I WANT TO FOCUS ON THE BOARDS OUTREACH EFFORTS REGARDING UNLICENSED ACTIVITY. UNLICENSED ACTIVITY IS OF GREAT CONCERN TO THE BORDER. PARTICULARLY WITH THE RAPID GROWTH OF TECHNOLOGY RANGING FROM WIDESPREAD USE OF THE INTERNET TO CONDUCT BUSINESS. TO THE ACTUAL TOOLS USED TO PERFORM PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING LAND SURVEYING GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS. COMPANIES NOT PROPERLY OVERSEEN BY LICENSEES ARE CONDUCTING BUSINESSES THROUGH WEBSITES AND COMMUNICATING VIA CELLPHONE AN ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION. THIS CAUSES DIFFICULTY IN LOCATING THE RESPONSIBLE INDIVIDUALS AS THERE IS OFTEN NO PHYSICAL ADDRESS INCLUDED IN THE CONTACT INFORMATION ON THE WEBSITE. FURTHERMORE THE BOARD HAS NO AUTHORITY TO SHUT DOWN WEBSITES AND CELL PHONES. ONE OF THE MOST COMMON FORMS OF UNLICENSED ACTIVITY THAT IS BROUGHT TO THE BOARD'S INTENTION INVOLVES LICENSE CONTRACTORS WHO MAY BE UNKNOWINGLY EXCEEDING THEIR LICENSE AUTHORITY. BY PERFORMING PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING LAND SURVEYING GEOLOGY SERVICES ON PROJECTS. PARTICULARLY IN THE USE OF TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED TOOLS. WE HAVE WORKED WITH THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD IN THE PAST TO PUBLICIZE THE LIMITATIONS OF LICENSE CONTRACTORS AN OFFER EDUCATION. REGARDING THE RESTRICTIONS OF THE USE OF PARTICULAR TOOLS SUCH AS GPS DRONES. AND GROUND PENETRATING RADAR ALSO OUR AND THE LIMITATIONS AND EXEMPTIONS PROVIDED BY THE BOARD STATUTES. ONE OF THE METHODS THAT THE BOARD USES TO DISCOURAGE UNLICENSED ACTIVITY INCLUDES OUTRAGE TO BOTH LICENSED AND UNLICENSED INDIVIDUALS. AS WELL AS TO THE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES THAT DEAL WITH THE PROFESSIONS THE BOARD REGULATES. WE DO THIS TO EDUCATE THEM REGARDING POTENTIAL AREAS OF UNLICENSED ACTIVITY INCLUDING THE UNKNOWING PRACTICE BY LICENSED INDIVIDUALS. DURING MEETINGS AN OUTREACH EVENTS WITH VARIOUS PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS SPORTS STAFF OF FOCUSED ON IDENTIFYING FOR INDUSTRY PROFESSIONALS. WAYS IN WHICH THEY CAN PARTICIPATE IN THE BOARD'S EFFORTS TO CURTAIL UNLICENSED ACTIVITY. LICENSEES WHO DISCOVER SUCH ACTIVITY ARE ENCOURAGED TO FILE FORMAL COMPLAINTS AND INCLUDE DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE RATHER THAN PASSING ALONG UNSUBSTANTIATED ALLEGATIONS AND INFORMAL CONVERSATIONAL SETTING OR CORRESPONDENT. SELECT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME FROM ANY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ASSEMBLYMEMBER KRISTIN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION I WAS IN HERE FOR THE LATTER PART OF IT -- BUT MOSTLY INTERESTED IN THE COMMENTS THAT WERE JUST MADE ABOUT -- ABOUT UNLICENSED ACTIVITY. HAS A HAS THE BOARD CONSIDERED I KNOW YOU REACHED OUT -- TO SEAL -- THE YOU KNOW THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD -- HAVE YOU ALSO REACHED OUT TO LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES WHERE PERMITS ARE BEING ISSUED AND EDUCATED PLANNING -- DIVISIONS WITH AND LOCAL MEANS WHEN PLANS COME FORWARD THIS MAY NOT CATCH THOSE THAT ARE UNLICENSED THAT ARE UNSCRUPULOUS AND THEY AREN'T EVEN GOING TO GET A PERMIT BUT FOR YOU MENTIONED THERE ARE SOME CONTRACTORS THAT MAY BE. OVER REACHING THEIR THE BOUNDARIES OF THEIR LICENSE. AND SO PLANS ARE ARE PUT IN FOR A PERMIT. AND YOU KNOW IT'S POSSIBLE THAT STAFFS COULD RECOGNIZE AREAS IF THEY WERE EDUCATED TO BE ABLE TO KNOW. THIS NEEDS TO HAVE AN ENGINEER LOOK AT IT OR A YOU KNOW SOME SOME TYPE OF STAMP -- HAS THAT EVER GOING FORTH TO HELP EDUCATE PLANNING STAFFS THAT LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES -- YES WE WE HAVE WORKED -- MORE RIGOROUSLY IN THE PAST AND ARE LOOKING INTO DOING IT AGAIN WORKING WITH -- LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES REGARDING -- WHEN I LICENSES NEEDED -- THEY ARE THE BUILDING DEPARTMENTS ARE VERY GOOD ABOUT KNOWING. WHEN AND PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS LICENSES NEEDED ON -- BUILDING DESIGN PLANS -- THEY OFTEN ARE THE ONES WHO WILL ALERT US WHEN IT APPEARS AN UNLICENSED PERSON. MAYBE UNLAWFULLY USING A LICENSEE STAM OR THAT. A LICENSEE MAY BE WORKING WITH AN UNLICENSED PERSON. AND SIMPLY STAMPING THE PLANS WITHOUT REVIEW. TO MEET THE RESPONSIBLE CHARGE LAWS WE'VE HAD CASES WHERE. WE'VE DISCOVERED THAT LICENSEES WOULD SIGN AND SAIL PLANS. FOR A BOTTLE OF SCOTCH SO WE WE HAVE WORKED WITH THE BUILDING DEPARTMENTS ON THOSE TYPES OF CASES -- I THINK. WITH REGARD TO LIKE THE LICENSE CONTRACTORS -- IT'S THE WORK THEY'RE DOING ON THEIR CONSTRUCTION SITES. BASED ON THE NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT'S AVAILABLE AND THEY DON'T REALIZE THAT THEY ARE GOING TO FALL ARE AND HOW THEY USE SOME OF THAT EQUIPMENT. TO DO THEIR WORK THAT THEY'VE NOW CROSSED OVER INTO SUCH THINGS AS THE PROFESSION OF LAND SURVEYING. AND SO THAT IS WHERE WE HAVE TRIED. TO IT WE HAVE WORKED IN THE PAST A WE'RE HOPING TO WORK AGAIN WITH THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD -- TO HAVE. THEM HELP US REACH OUT TO THEIR LICENSEES -- THROUGH THEIR ENFORCEMENT AND OUTREACH EFFORTS WOULD YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW WHEN THE LAST TIME WAS THAT YOU DID AN OUTREACH EFFORT EDUCATING GENERAL CONCORD. ALL CONTRACTORS. ON THAT -- I WOULD SAY THAT MY DIRECT. DIRECTLY WITH -- LICENSE CONTRACTORS IT'S BUT IT'S PRIDE IN A FEW YEARS BY -- THIS LAST YEAR THE LAST COUPLE YEARS ACTUALLY LOCAL AGENCIES BECAUSE OF THEIR CONTRACTING METHODOLOGIES YES WE HAVE CONTRACTORS ENGINEERS AND SURVEYORS TO TRY TO HELP THEM RECOGNIZE WHERE THE LIMITATIONS OF ALL THE PRACTICES AREN'T ARE TRYING TO HELP THEM. NOT PUT ANY LICENSE MEMBER WHICHEVER BOARD IT IS INTO A COMPROMISING POSITION WOULD RATHER TRY TO AVOID THAT AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT I I PERSONALLY APPRECIATE THOSE NOTICES WHEN THEY COME IN THE MAIL.

WE DID AN EXHAUSTIVE SEARCH FOR A NEW BUREAU CHIEF INCLUDING SENDING THE JOB POSTING TO THE INDUSTRY. STAKEHOLDERS AND TO COLLEGES IN THIS AREA. WE ALTERNATELY FOUND THE BEST CANDIDATE RIGHT HERE AT THE DEPARTMENT CONSUMER AFFAIRS JANICE ON CHEST. MOST RECENTLY THE LICENSING CHIEF AT THE BOARD OF ACCOUNTANCY. ALSO LIKE TO MENTION THAT SHE STARTED MAIL ROOM IN THE DEPARTMENT. I WANT TO THANK THE VERY PEOPLE STAFF OF THE BUREAU ESPECIALLY SANDRA PATTERSON WHO STEPPED IN TO KEEP THE BUREAU RUNNING FOR TWO MONTHS DURING OUR TREATMENT. WITH THAT I WILL TURN IT OVER TO T. SUCH AS THANK YOU DEAN CONGRADULATIONS GINA. IS THIS ONE OKAY. MY NAME IS GINA SANCHEZ THE NEWLY APPOINTED CHIEF OF THE CEMETERY AND FUNERAL BUREAU I WAS APPOINTED ON FEBRUARY TWENTIETH AND I'M HONORED TO REPRESENT THE BEER ON THE CONSUMERS WE SERVE. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK DIRECTOR FEEL FOR BEING HERE SUPPORTING THE RIO TODAY. THE CALIFORNIA STATE BOARD OF FUNERAL DIRECTORS AND PALMER'S WAS ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN THIRTY NINE AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE CEMETERY BOARD IN. NINETEEN FORTY NINE IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES LEGISLATIVE DISCUSSION REGARDING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TWO SEPARATE BOARDS LED TO THE CREATING OF THE CEMETERY AND FUNERAL BUREAU. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AS A RESULT OF THE BUREAU'S LAST SENSE THAT BILL ASSEMBLY BILL ONE EIGHTY MERGE THE BEER AS TWO SEPARATE PRACTICE TAX. INTO THE CEMETERY AND FUNERAL ACT AND ALSO MERGE THE BUREAU'S TWO SEPARATE FUNDS INTO ONE FINE NOW KNOWN AS A CEMETERY AND FUNERAL FINDS. IF YOU'RE CURRENTLY HAS TWENTY THREE POINT FIVE AUTHORIZED POSITIONS CONSISTING OF NINE FULL TIME STAFF LOCATED THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AND FOURTEEN POINT FIVE OFFICE STAFF LOCATED IN SACRAMENTO. TODAY THE BUREAU LICENSES REGULATES AND INVESTIGATES COMPLAINTS AGAINST THIRTEEN DIFFERENT LICENSING CATEGORIES IN CALIFORNIA. TOTALING APPROXIMATELY THIRTEEN THOUSAND LICENSEES. THE LICENSING CATEGORIES INCLUDE FUNERAL ESTABLISHMENTS FUNERAL DIRECTORS PRIVATELY OWNED CEMETERIES AND CREMATORIUMS CEMETERY AND CREMATORIUM MANAGERS ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL LICENSES WITHIN THE INDUSTRY. EACH YEAR THERE ARE OVER TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND DEATHS IN CALIFORNIA THAT REQUIRE THE SERVICES OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR LICENSEES. THE BUREAU REGULATES NEARLY EVERY ASPECT OF THE LICENSE CEMETERY AND FUNERAL INDUSTRIES. SPECIFIC TO EXPEDITIONARY OVERSIGHT -- MONITORS THE PRE NEED FUNERAL TRUST FUNDS CEMETERY IN DOWN MEDICARE TRUST FUNDS AND CEMETERY SPECIAL CARE TRUST FUNDS TOTALING MORE THAN TWO BILLION DOLLARS. BUREAU STAFF REVIEW ANNUAL REPORTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND PERFORM SITE VISITS AND EXAMINATIONS TO ENSURE THESE TRUST FUNDS ARE ADMINISTERED APPROPRIATELY AND IN THE BEST INTEREST OF CALIFORNIA'S CONSUMERS. THE BUREAU HAS STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE THE LICENSING AND PRACTICE ACT IN THE BUSINESS PROFESSIONS CODE RELATING TO THE FUNERAL CEMETERY AND CREMATORY INDUSTRIES. THE BEER ALSO HAS JURISDICTION OVER SPECIFIED SECTIONS OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE DEALING WITH HUMAN REMAINS CEMETERY AND CREMATORY PROVISIONS. YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA GET TO THE ISSUES RIGHT WE WANT TO MAKE DO YOU WANT ME TO GET STRAIGHT. SO I SORRY I MISUNDERSTOOD I OWE EVERYTHING HAVING TO DO WE HAVE THE HAVE YOU A LITTLE THE GOOD WORK THAT -- THAT YOU GUYS. TO I DO LIKE TO PRACTICE SO I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN WITH ISSUE NUMBER TWO RELATED TO THE IN DOWN THE CARE FUNDS WHICH I WAS JUST SPEAKING ABOUT -- ASSEMBLY BILL ONE EIGHTY DIRECTOR THE BUREAU TO CONDUCT A STUDY IN ORDER TO DETERMINE IF IN DOWN THE CARE LEVELS AND EACH LICENSE CEMETERY ARE SUFFICIENT TO COVER. THE COST OF FUTURE MAINTENANCE IN DOWN THE CARE CEMETERIES DEPOSIT FUNDS INTO AN ENDEMIC CARE TRUST. FOR EACH GRAVER OTHER INTERMENT SPACE THEY SELL. THE DEPOSITS MAKE UP THE CORE PRINCIPLE OF THE TRUST AND STATE LAW REQUIRES THE TRUSTEE TO INVEST THIS PRINCIPLE. THE LONG RUN INTENT IS TO BUILD ENOUGH PRINCIPLE TO ENSURE INCOME GENERATED FROM THE INVESTMENTS. PAYS FOR CEMETERY MAINTENANCE AFTER THE CEMETERIES OF SOLD ALL OF THEIR INTERMENT SPACES. OF THE ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY CEMETERY. TWENTY ONE EARN ENOUGH INCOME FROM PRINCIPLE INVESTMENTS AND WILL REQUIRE ONLY MINIMAL IN DOWN THE CARE FUND GROWTH TO ENSURE LONGER INSUFFICIENCY. HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN DO NOT EARN ENOUGH INCOME FROM PRINCIPLE INVESTMENTS AND LONGER INSUFFICIENCY REQUIRE MORE SIGNIFICANT TRUSTS GROWTH. AND FORTY TWO DO NOT EARN ENOUGH INCOME FROM INVESTMENTS AND MEAN TAKE TO MAINTAIN THE SPACES THEY HAVE ALREADY SOLD. ALONG WITH SUFFICIENCY IS NOT LIKELY IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED HOWEVER THAT THIRTY FOUR OF THESE FORTY TWO WERE ESTABLISHED BEFORE IN DOWN THE CARE TRUSTS WERE REQUIRED. SO MANY HAVE SOLD SPACES PRIOR TO THAT BEING ESTABLISHED. THE BEER IS COMMITTED TO PARTNERING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND OUR STAKEHOLDERS TO BEGIN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT RAISING THE IN DOWN THE CARE DEPOSIT RATES ADDITIONALLY. IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO CONDUCT A FOLLOW UP STUDY AS A FUTURE STUDY MAY BE BETTER INFORMED IF THE BUREAU IS ABLE TO GATHER ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. FROM LICENSEES AND STAKEHOLDERS. THIS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WILL NOT ONLY PROVIDE A FULL REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE. BUT WILL ALSO ASSIST THE BUREAU IN ITS OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITIES ENSURING THE SUSTAINABILITY OF IN DOWN THE CARE TRUSTS. I STATED IN THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE THIS IS A MATTER OF PUBLIC PROTECTION TO PRESERVE AND KEEP CEMETERIES FROM BECOMING I'M CAPT. AND PLACES OF REPROACH AND DESOLATION IN THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY ARE SITUATED. NEXT I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE REGARDING THE RECENT COST ANALYSIS OF THE BUREAU'S LICENSING FEES. IN TWO THOUSAND LEGISLATION CREATED WHAT IS TODAY THE CEMETERY AND FUNERAL RURAL. AT THAT TIME THE STATUTORY FEET AUTHORITY WAS ALSO TRANSFERRED TO THE BUREAU HOWEVER THE PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED BE CAPS REMAIN THE SAME. SINCE ITS ESTABLISHMENT IN TWO THOUSAND THE BUREAU HAS NOT HAD ANY FEE INCREASES AND ACCORDING TO THE US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR WEBSITE DURING THIS TIME THE CONSUMER PRICE INSTEAD INDEX. HAS INCREASED BY GOODS AND SERVICES 49%. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE BUREAU CONTRACTED WITH AN OUTSIDE VENDOR TO CONDUCT THE FEES STUDY TO ENSURE THE BUREAU WAS FULLY ACCOUNTING FOR ALL COSTS. AND RECOVERING ADEQUATE REVENUES TO BE REIMBURSED FOR ITS EXPENSIVE THIS EXPENSES THIS ACTION WAS INITIATED IN RESPONSE TO CONCERN THAT THE BUREAU'S EXPENDITURES RECEIPT EXCEEDED ITS REVENUE. CAUSING THE BUREAU TO BE STRUCTURALLY IN BALANCE IT WAS PROJECTED TO BECOME PHYSICALLY INSOLVENT AND BUDGET YOUR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO THE REPORT ESTABLISH A PRICING SCENARIO THAT BETTER REFLECTED THE TRUE CROSS TO FREEZE. UP FEES TO PERFORM THE BUREAU'S FUNCTION AND HELP ENSURE SUSTAINABLE REGULATORY PROGRAM. THE FINDINGS IN THE REPORT CONCLUDED THAT THE BUREAU WAS NOT ACCOUNTING FOR AND RECOVERING ADEQUATE REVENUE TO FULLY FUND THE BUREAU'S COST. THE BUREAU HAS A HISTORY OF FINANCIAL OF CONSERVATIVE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND CONTINUES TO OPERATE AS SUCH THIS IS A LOT OF THE BUREAU TO REMAIN SOLVENT BUT DOES NOT RESOLVE THE STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE. AND CONTINUED DECLINE IN THE BUREAU SPINE CONDITION MONTHS IN RESERVE. IF THE BUREAU IS GRETA IS GRANTED THE STATURE RATE INCREASE OF THE FEE CAP. STAFF WILL PREPARE A REGULATORY RULEMAKING FILE AS NECESSARY TO PURSUE INCREMENTAL INCREASES TO THE BUREAU'S FEE SCHEDULE. MOVING ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FOUR IN REGARDS TO BREEZE. AS REPORTED IN THE BUREAU'S LAST AND SAID BETWEEN THE TWO SEPARATE SPECIAL FUNDS THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH BREEZE CAME TO APPROXIMATELY NINETY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS. AS A FISCAL YEAR. THIRTEEN FOURTEEN THE ORIGINAL TOTAL PROJECTED COSTS FOR BREEZE WAS 200-580-00700 SEVENTY EIGHT DOLLARS. AND THE TOTAL COST MEANT BY THE BUREAU TO DATE IS. 200-610-00500 EIGHTY THREE DOLLARS WE WILL NOT BE RECUPERATED FOR THESE COSTS AS THIS MONEY REPRESENTS AN INVESTMENT MADE BY THE BUREAU THAT IS INFORMING OUR WORK AS WE MOVE FORWARD. TO A FUTURE IT SYSTEM. WAS NO LONGER CONTRIBUTING TO ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PRES AND DO NOT ANTICIPATE ANY FUTURE COSTS. UNLESS THE BUREAU IS INTEGRATED INTO BREEZE AS PART OF THE DEPARTMENT'S BUSINESS MODERNIZATION PLAN. THE CURRENT STRUCTURE OF THE BUREAU REQUIRE STAFF TO USE TO LEGACY SYSTEMS DATABASES TO PERFORM THEIR DUTIES. THE CURRENT SYSTEMS DO NOT MEET THE NEEDS OF THE BUREAU IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND A MODERN SYSTEM WOULD BETTER SERVE OUR LICENSEES AND STAFF. AS PART OF THE BUSINESS MODERNIZATION PLAN THE BEER WAS ALREADY DEVELOPED A PROJECT CHARTER. HI AND A REPORT TO IDENTIFIES BUSINESS PROCESSES PRIOR TO THE END OF LAST YEAR. THE BUREAU IN COLLABORATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT BEGAN PROCESS MAPPING ENFORCEMENT HAS ITS FIRST STEP. SINCE MY APPOINTMENT AS OF FEBRUARY TWENTIETH I'VE ALREADY MET WITH THE DEPARTMENT'S INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TEAM. AND OF SCHEDULED MY FIRST MEETING WITH THE BUSINESS MODERNIZATION PLAN TEAM. THE CALL FOR COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION IS TWENTY TWENTY TWO HOWEVER I DO ANTICIPATE THE BUREAU IMPLEMENT TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS PRIOR TO THAT. SUCH AS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CREDIT CARD PAY. I AM REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS PROCESS IN SECURING AN UPDATED I. T. SYSTEM CAPABLE OF PROVIDING OUR LICENSEES AND EASY AND SEAMLESS APPLICATION RENEWAL PROCESS. AS A BETTER WAY TO SUPPORT THEM AS THEY ASSIST CALIFORNIA'S CONSUMER. SORRY JUST JUST A CLASS. NEXT MOVING ON ISSUE NUMBER FIVE REGARDING THE REGULATION OF PET CREMATORIUM. THIS IS A NEW ISSUE RAISED BY CONSTITUENTS TO THE VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD IN REGARDS TO THE CREMATION OVER TO PASS. WE SYMPATHIZE WITH THE CONSTITUENT FOR A LOSS AND ANY HARDSHIP SHE EXPERIENCE WHEN THE PETS WERE CREMATED. CURRENTLY PRAC CREMATIONS ARE NOT REGULATED IN CALIFORNIA AND THE BEER WAS NOT RECEIVED ANY COMPLAINTS TO WE KNOW OF ANY OTHER CONCERNS IN THIS AREA TO DATE. IF YOU'RE A LICENCES CREMATORY IS THAT ARE CONTRACTED BY FUNERAL ESTABLISHMENTS TO PROVIDE SERVICES FOR HUMAN REMAINS. THE CONSUMER PAYS THE FUNERAL ESTABLISHMENT DIRECTLY FOR THESE SERVICES. FROM WHAT THE BROKEN TELL IT APPEARS CRAP HIM CREMATIONS WORK IN THE SAME WAY AND SERVICES CAN BE CONTRACTOR THAT NERI OFFICE. THAT BEING SAID THE BUREAU IN COLLABORATION WITH THE VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD IS REQUESTING TIME TO RESEARCH AND PERFORM A DEEPER DIVE INTO THIS AREA PRIOR TO ANY LEGISLATIVE CHANGES. THE BUREAU AND THE BATTERY MEDICAL BOARD HAVE ALREADY CONVENE ONE MEETING ON THIS AND WE PLAN TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION. WE APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION ON THIS ISSUE WE LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD. AND WILL REPORT BACK TO THE COMMITTEES WITHIN A YEAR ON THIS ISSUE. LASTLY MOVING ON TO ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN THE MAINTENANCE OF CEMETERIES. THE CEMETERY PRESENTS ITS OWN UNIQUE CHALLENGES RELATING TO PROPERTY MAINTENANCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH EXISTING LAW THE BUREAU CONDUCTS ANNUAL UNANNOUNCED INSPECTIONS OF EACH LICENSE CEMETERY. AND WE ARE CONSISTENT IN MEETING THIS MANDATE. I SPECIFIED IN REGULATION THE CARE AND MAINTENANCE OF EACH CEMETERY MAY VARY DEPENDING ON THE CEMETERY SIZE LOCATION TOPOGRAPHY AND TYPE OF INTERMENTS. SPECIFICALLY RELATING TO PIERCE BROTHERS PAHALA MEMORIAL PARK WHICH I WILL REFER TO HIS PEERS BROTHERS. THIS PROPERTY IS OVER ONE HUNDRED EIGHT OF GRAVES AND HEADSTONES AND MARKERS. WHEN THE BUREAU RECIEVE THE INITIAL COMPLAINT REFERENCE IN THE ISSUE THE PROPERTY WAS ISSUED A WARNING LETTER WHICH IS NOT A GAME THE GATE A FINER PENALTY? FOR FAILURE TO PERFORM MAINTENANCE I'VE IT CEMETERY. AS THE COMPLAINT WAS AND SATISFIED WITH THE OUTCOME THE BUREAU RE OPEN THIS COMPLAINT AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE CEMETERY WAS TAKING NECESSARY STEPS TO COMPLY WITH THE CEMETERY MAINTENANCE STANDARDS AND NO ADDITIONAL ACTION WAS TAKEN. THE FILE WAS CLOSED FOR A SECOND TIME ON JUNE IN JUNE OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IN ADDITIONAL TO NORMAL MAINTENANCE THERE ARE OUTSIDE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS LIKE THE RECENT YEARS LONG DROUGHT. AND THAT HAS MADE SOIL AT SOME TENTS CEMETERIES HOSPITABLE TO THE RUN POPULATION. EVEN WITH INCREASED EFFORTS PIERCE BROTHERS HAS AN ONGOING STRUGGLE TO CONTROL BERMAN PROBLEMS AND KEEP THE DIRT FROM BURNING RODENTS OFF MARKERS. AS MUCH OF THE IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDING AREAS PRIVATE RESIDENCES. THE PEST CONTROL COMPANY IS LIMITED ON TREATMENT OPTIONS DUE TO THE REGULATION OF CHEMICAL USE NEAR HOUSING. HERE'S BROTHER IS CURRENTLY ASSIGNING A GROUNDS CREW TO COMB THE ONE HUNDRED ACRE PROPERTY IN AN EFFORT TO REMOVE GO FOR DIRT PILES AND REPAIR MARKERS AND HAD STONE'S. THEY ALSO PROVIDE VISITING FAMILIES WITH A MONTHLY NEWSLETTER MOWING SCHEDULE MEMORIAL TRIMMING SCHEDULE AND A FLOWER PLACEMENT CALENDAR. THE BUREAU IS DILIGENTLY MONITORING THESE EFFORTS AND WILL INITIATE HEIGHTENED DISCIPLINE SHOULD PIERCE BROTHERS FAILED TO FOLLOW THE LAW. THE BILL CONTINUES TO WORK WITH ALL LICENSE CEMETERIES TO ENSURE THEY ARE HEARING TO ME THAT STANDARDS ALL THE WHILE CONTINUING TO MAINTAIN OVERSIGHT OF THE LICENSEES. THE BUREAU MUST REMAIN COGNIZANT OF THE FACT THAT EXTREME MEASURES OF REVOCATION. OF A LICENCE FOR CEMETERY WOULD REMOVE YOUR OVERSIGHT. THAT IS WHY BUREAU STAFF WORKED DILIGENTLY WITH THE LICENSEE AND PRACTICE OF PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE MODEL IN ORDER TO BRING THEM INTO COMPLIANCE. THAT CONCLUDES MY TESTIMONY TODAY I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME BEFORE THIS BODY AND PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO THE IMPORTANT WORK THE BUREAU DOES TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS. ESPECIALLY IN THEIR TIME OF THE MOST CRITICAL NEED. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEES AND HUMBLY ASK THAT YOU EXTEND THE BUREAU SENSE THAT FOR ANOTHER FOUR YEARS. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISS AN REVIEW OF MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS. SENATOR ARCHULETA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARENTS YOUR TODAY -- ONE OF THE CONCERNS I HAVE IS FOR MILITARY. WIN -- THE FAMILY REQUESTS CREMATION AND OUT AT SEA. THE ISSUE THERE IS -- HOW DO WE ARE SURE OF THE FAMILY WHAT IS THE PROCESS YOU THAT THERE IS A MIXTURE -- IN THE PROCESS AND SO ON AND WHAT REGULATIONS DO YOU HAVE IN PLACE. THAT IN EFFECT THAT IF. IF THE DEPARTURE -- VIOLATED ANY PURSE. I CAN SAY THAT ARE YOU JUST WHEN YOU SPOKE OF MAKE SURE MAKE SURE OF HUMAN REMAINS BETWEEN THOSE TWO TWO PEOPLE -- SPECIFIC TO THE PREVENTATIVE MEASURES TAKEN BY THE BOARD IT IS REQUIRED THAT LICENSE CEMETERY MUST MAINTAIN RECORDS. OF INTERMENTS OWNERSHIP OF ALL PLOT SOLD ACCURATE PLOT MAX AND THE ARE AND AND A LIST OF THOSE WHO ARE CREMATED -- KEEPING A LOT OF THOSE WHICH ARE SUBMITTED AN ANNUAL REPORTS TO THE BUREAU -- IF AT ANY TIME THE BUREAU IS MADE AWARE OF A COMPLAINT WHETHER IT'S THROUGH AN INSPECTION OF ONE OF OUR BUREAU STAFF FOR COMPLETE FROM THE PUBLIC. I INVESTIGATION IS OPENED AND A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION IS TO DOWN TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY. VIOLATIONS OF LAW AT THAT TIME AS I SAID WE DO -- PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE MODEL WHERE WE TRY TO WORK WITH THE LICENSEE AND MEDIATE WITH THE CONSUMER -- DEPENDING ON THE AGREE JUST MISS OF THE VIOLATION OF COURSE THAT WOULD DETERMINAR SPECIFIC ACTION AND IS A COMMON PRACTICE THAT ONE OF THE STAFF MEMBERS FROM THE CEMETERY. WITH A COMPANY THE FAMILY OUT TO SEE -- AND DEPOSITING THE THE REMAINS THE ASHES OUT THERE. I'M I'M CERTAIN OF OF THAT RELATION I COULD LOOK INTO THAT AND GIVE THAT TO YOU IN A WRITTEN RESPONSE. MAKE SURE IT'S DONE PROPERLY WITH HONOR AND DIGNITY. QUESTION. THANK THANK YOU SENATOR ARCHULETA CENTER LEYVA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD MORNING. REGARDING THE MAINTENANCE OF CEMETERIES HOW OFTEN DOES THE BUREAU ACTUALLY INSPECT THE GROUNDS OF CEMETERIES -- ONCE A YEAR OUR BUREAU STAFF VISIT EACH LICENSE CEMETERY AND WE ARE A CURRENT IN THAT MANDATE VERY GOOD DO YOU THINK IT SHOULD BE MORE OFTEN. IF THERE IS REASON FOR IT TO BE MORE OFTEN THERE HAS IN THE PAST EVEN AS MUCH AS THE PURE PREVIOUS BURJI MISS MORE WOULD VISIT -- SPECIFIC CEMETERIES MORE OFTEN TO ENSURE THOSE MEAN AND STANDARDS ARE BEING MET VERY GOOD THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER LEYVA SENATOR GALGIANI. WELL FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR FOR INCLUDING YOUR BOARD AT THIS HEARING. WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY WE HAD AN ISSUE WITH A CEMETERY THAT WAS NOT FINANCIALLY SOLVENT AND WE HAD TO ADDRESS MANY ISSUES? I ENDED UP DOING LEGISLATION AND DISCOVERED THAT THE STATUTE WAS QUITE OLD GIVEN THAT NOT VERY MUCH ATTENTION WAS NORMALLY GIVEN BY LEGISLATORS -- TO THE CEMETERY BOARD CELL I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT -- SECONDLY DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT PROCESS FOR INSURING THAT -- IS THAT CEMETERIES ARE SOLVENT. IS SUFFICIENT OR ARE THERE CHANGES OR UPDATES THAT WE SHOULD BE CONSIDERING FOR THAT PROCESS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR RECENT STUDY ON IN DOWN THE CARE FIND SPECIFIC TO CEMETERIES WITHIN DOWN THE CARE FUNDS TO ENSURE. THE LONG RUN MAINTENANCE OF THAT CEMETERY I BELIEVE THAT -- WE SHOULD LOOK AT THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THAT REPORT WHICH AS IT GIVES A RECOMMENDATION EITHER 10% OF THE NET PRICE. TO BE REYES FOR THOSE -- FEES FOR ENDEMIC CARE BEANS -- OR THEY GIVE A CERTAIN DOLLAR AMOUNT DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF INTERNMENT -- I DO RECOMMEND THAT WE LOOK AT THOSE VERY CLOSELY AND WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE'S INCREASING THOSE FEES. ARE YOU AWARE OF WHETHER THERE IS ANY PLAN TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT THOSE FEES. THROUGH ANY COMMITTEE OF THE LEGISLATURE OR OTHERWISE. I AM I KNOW WHERE -- BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT'S NOT HAPPENING BEING THAT THIS IS JUST MY SECOND WEEKEND SO I I'LL BE OUT THERE I THINK THINK COMMITTEE STAFF WILL WORK WITH THEM. ON THIS ISSUE IN PARTICULAR WAS RAISED IN THE STAFF REPORT AND WE'LL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON TRYING TO CALIBRATE THAT IN THE CORRECT WAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU. YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE PANEL MEMBERS WELL LET ME JUST SAY -- THAT I APPRECIATE THE SENSITIVITY OF CENTER TO LAY THAT THAT SHE'S REYES REGARDED MAINTENANCE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S AND IT'S IT'S VERY HARD TO HEAR THAT. THE PIERCE BROTHERS -- REVIEW AND PROBLEMS THERE AND IT CERTAINLY GETS ALL OF US CONCERNED THAT. THIS ISN'T JUST A ONE OFF THIS COULD BE HAPPENING IN MANY OTHER PLACES AND WE WANT TO RESPECT. THOSE WHO HAVE PASSED AND THAT MEANS RESPECTING THE PLACE WHERE THEY ARE VERY DO WE ASK YOU TO CONTINUE YOUR VIGILANCE THERE. TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IT'S DONE CORRECTLY TO SAY THAT THERE IS SENSITIVITY BY THIS CHAIR AND MAYBE OTHERS -- ABOUT THAT CIRCUMSTANCE WITH THE PET CREMATION. THAT OCCURRED AND WITH A COURAGE THAT TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WITH THE VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD AT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. I WAS CONSIDERING -- INTRODUCING LEGISLATION ON THIS YEAR NOT HELD OFF THE MOMENT. I'D LOVE TO SEE YOU GUYS COME TOGETHER IN A SENSIBLE. PLAN TO MAKE SURE THESE TYPES OF THINGS DON'T HAPPEN AND AND HOW WE CAN A MONITOR THAT AND REGULATED -- WOULD BE SOMETHING I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR INPUT ON OKAY. SO WITH THAT I WON IT BY ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC TO COME UP AND SHARE THEIR THOUGHTS ON THE SUNSET REVIEW. BEFORE WE CONCLUDE THIS SITE THIS PART OF THE HEARING. WELCOME TO YOU SAY YOUR NAME FOR THE RECORD. SURE MEMBERS JERRY DOES MEN ON BEHALF OF THE CEMETERY AND MORTUARY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA C. MAC WANTED THANK -- DEAN GARFIELD DIRECTOR FEEL LOW AND WELCOME ALONG WITH THE COMMITTEE THE NEW BUREAU CHIEF FOR REALLY PLEASED TO HAVE. OF AN APPOINTMENT OF A DIRECTOR WHO WILL ã PROVIDE LEADERSHIP AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION THAT WE THINK ARE VITAL -- AND SO THEREFORE ALSO ENCOURAGED OF IMPORTANT CONSUMER PROTECTION MECHANISMS AND LIKE TO JUST ADDRESS THREE OF THE ISSUES BRIEFLY THAT BROUGHT UP IN THE COMMITTEE -- IN THE COMMITTEE BACKGROUND PAPER STARTING WITH THE INTEL MAKER FUNDS. YOU KNOW AND OF PICKING UP ON THE CENTER GALGIANI A PROPERLY IT MENTIONED AND THAT IS PROVIDING FOR THE FUTURE OF CEMETERIES IN THEIR ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR THE MAINTENANCE CARE THE CEMETERY SPECIALLY AFTER. THERE'S NO MORE ROOM OF WE PARTICIPATED AS THE PUBLIC IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ATOMIC CARE FUND RECOMMENDATIONS AND REPORT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE AND SUPPORT THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS IN THAT REPORT. SO IF THERE WERE TO BE LEGISLATION THAT COMES OUT OF THIS PROCESS THAT WOULD INCREASE THE MINIMUM OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO AND DOWN OCCUR FUNDS TO EITHER. BASICALLY DOUBLE THE MINIMUM CONTRIBUTION FOR A 10% OF THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE PRICE THE FOR FOR THE PRICE. OF THAT IT APPLAUDED SOLD A WE WOULD SUPPORT THAT LEGISLATION THINK IT WOULD HELP PROVIDE FOR THE FUTURE OF VIABILITY OF ATOMIC HER FUNDS AND ALSO NOTE THAT. LEGISLATION THAT WAS ENACTED JUST -- TWO YEARS AGO EIGHTY NINE TWENTY SIX BY SOME MEMBERS IRWIN ALSO PROVIDES A UNIT TRUST A DISTRIBUTION METHOD FOR INTEL MAKER FUNDS. OF THAT WILL ALSO HELP FOR THE FUTURE VIABILITY ODOMETER FUNDS AND WE KNOW THE PAYROLL -- PREPARING REGULATIONS ON THAT APART TO ENACTMENT NEXT YEAR. SECONDLY IN TERMS OF THE MAINTENANCE STANDARDS YOU KNOW OUR ASSOCIATION INDUSTRY ALSO PARTICIPATED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MEAT AND STANDARDS AS REQUIRED BY LAW. IN THE PUBLIC ABOVE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AND SUPPORT THE MEAT AND STANDARDS AND COMPLIANCE WITH THOSE MAINTENANCE STANDARDS OF WE KNOW THAT THE PROPERTY THAT'S BEEN MENTIONED IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER IS A MEMBER OF OUR ASSOCIATION. AND WE'VE CONFERRED WITH THEM ABOUT THEIR CONTINUED EFFORTS TO COMPLY WITH THE STANDARDS AS MANDATED BY THE LAW AND WE BELIEVE THAT THEY WILL MAKE THEIR THE BEST THE GOOD FAITH EFFORTS. WE ALSO SUPPORT THE THE STEP UP COMPLIANCE MODEL THAT -- INFORMED FOR SMITH THE BUREAU IN THE DEPARTMENT AT KERRY DEPARTMENT WIDE IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT CONSUMER PROTECTION WE THINK THIS MODEL OF SHOE IS BEING PURSUED HERE WE SUPPORT THAT. THEN FINALLY ON THE PET CREMATORIUMS AND WE ARE ALSO SENSITIVE TO THE SITUATION IN THE CONSUMER THAT IS -- HAD THE ISSUE WITH THE PRESS OF PET CREMATORIUMS WE WERE JUST EMPHASIZES DISCUSSIONS BEFORE THAT YOU THE ENTIRE CEMETERY FUNERAL BUREAU THE FUNDING OF THE BUREAU THE FOCUS OF THE BUREAU OF THE GREAT BODIES OF LAWS THAT ARE OUT THERE ARE. FOR THE INTERNET HUMAN REMAINS AND THAT THE AND THE FEES THAT ARE PAID BY THE INDUSTRY TO SUPPORT THE BEER ARE FOR HUMAN REMAINS. AND SO WE THINK THE APPROPRIATE LEAD IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS MIGHT BE MORE APPROPRIATE LIKE THE VET MED BOARD MORE THAN THE CEMETERY BUREAU BUT OF COURSE THEY HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE IN TERMS OF LICENSING THE CREMATORY ISN'T CREMATORY STANDARDS BUT WE'RE VERY SENSITIVE TO THIS. IDEA OF PETS AND HUMANS EVERYONE'S WELL THERE'S A DISCUSSION OF HAVING THEM IN THE SAME CEMETERY AND THERE'S A REAL SENSIBILITY TO THE INDIVIDUALS HAVE THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR FOR A HUNDRED YEARS OF THEIR EXPECTATIONS. SO WE REALLY SEE -- A LINE THERE A BIT THAT WE WANT TO BE IF YOU'RE CAREFUL ABOUT AS WE IS IN THEIR BLOOD RIGHT VERY GOOD THANK FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. MISTER CHAIRMAN TERRY ASSOCIATES REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA FUNERAL DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. MR CHEAP CALL THIS LAST NIGHT ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. AND I WAS CAUGHT OFF GUARD BY JUST HOW BIG. OF AN INDUSTRY THIS HAS BECOME IN TERMS OF TAKING CARE OF PETS AT THIS AT THE END OF LIFE WE HAD A LITTLE KITTY THE HEADS SELECT ON MY SON'S BED ALL OF HIS LIFE AND WHEN HE WE PUT THAT CáC A VERY SECOND WE PUT HER TO SLEEP. THE VETERINARIAN VETERINARY HOSPITAL OFFERED US THE CHOICE OF EITHER WE CREMATE THE CAT INDIVIDUALLY WE CREMATED IN A GROUP. AND SO WE CHOSE INDIVIDUALLY AND THEY GIVE YOU A LITTLE. YOU KNOW THEY SEND THE ASHES BACK AND I THOUGHT IT WAS A NICE THING TO DO WHAT I DIDN'T REALIZE IS THAT THIS IS A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR BUSINESS. AND WE SHARED WITH MISTER CHIEF. OF THIS MORNING THE CATALOG. FOR CREMATORY DEVICES AND THAT FOR HUMAN BEINGS WAS TWO PAGES. FOR PETS IT IS FOUR PAGES SO IT IS SOMETHING WORTH LOOKING AT AND WORTH TALKING ABOUT.

ONE FUNDED COMPLETELY FROM COURT REPORTER LICENSE FEES THE T. R. F. WAS SET UP TO ASSIST QUALIFIED INDIGENT LITIGANTS WITH TRANSCRIPT COSTS. THE FUN IS TO PROGRAMS THE MAIN FUND SET UP IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE REQUIRES INDIGENT LITIGANTS TO HAVE A PRO BONO ATTORNEY HANDLING THE CASE. AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN A TWO YEAR PILOT PROJECT WAS DEVELOPED TO ALLOW PROPER LITIGANTS. LIVING IT'S REPRESENTING THEMSELVES ACCESS TO THE FUN. BB CODE EIGHTY THIRTY POINT TWO AUTHORIZES THE BOARD TO TRANSFER FUNDS TO THE TRF IN INCREMENTS OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR A TOTAL OF THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ANNUALLY. DURING THE BOARDS LAST SUNSET REVIEW THE CAPITA PRO PER PROGRAM WHICH RATES FROM. THIRTY THOUSAND TO SEVENTY FIVE THIS BECAME EFFECTIVE JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THE WAR WAS ABLE TO PROCESS TWICE THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS AS IN PRIOR YEARS. THE PRO BONO PROGRAM RECEIVES TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FROM THE TOTAL AMOUNT TRANSFERRED. ANOTHER CHANGE AS A RESULT OF THE LATEST -- SUNSET REVIEW WAS THE EXCLUSION STATIUS LITIGANTS FROM THE T. R. TWENTY SEVENTEEN AS OF THAT CHANGE THIRTY SIX APPLICATIONS WERE RETURNED ALLOWING APPROXIMATELY NINE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED TO BE DISTRIBUTED TO TWENTY FIVE NON VEXATIOUS CLAIMANTS. BB CODE EIGHTY THIRTY POINT TO A PROVIDES THAT A TRANSFER THAT TO THE TRF IN EXCESS OF THE FUND BALANCE ESTABLISHED AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH FISCAL YEAR. SHALL NOT BE MADE IF THE BOARD -- BY THE BOARD IF THE TRANSFER WILL RESULT IN THE REDUCTION OF THE BALANCE OF THE COURT PORTER SPINE. TO AN AMOUNT LESS THAN SIX MONTHS OPERATING BUDGET. DESPITE TIGHTENING OUR BELTS WITH YOUR MEETINGS PURSUING A FEW INCREASING PACE OF RETIRING LICENSEES. KEEPING A SMALL BUT MIGHTY STAFF WITH RISING LABOR COSTS THE BOARD WAS UNABLE TO TRANSFER FUNDS TO THE TRF. BEGINNING IN FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY SEVENTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE BOARD WAS ABLE TO PROCESS APPLICATIONS RECEIVED THROUGH JULY SIXTH TWENTY SEVENTEEN WITH THE REMAINING FUNDS -- AND THE TIARA. AND AT THE TIME THE T. R. AFFLECK FUNDS THE BOARDS FREE INCREASED REGULATION PACKAGE WAS STILL UNDER DEPARTMENT -- AND AGENCY REVIEW AND HAD NOT BEEN SUBMITTED TO OIL FOR REVIEW. THEREFORE WAS DEEMED PRUDENT -- TO SEND THURMOND ON HOW TO RESET MET WHEN THE FUND RE OPENED. THE LICENSE FEE INCREASE PORTION OTHER REGULATIONS PACKAGE WAS APPROVED AND BECAME EFFECTIVE JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY NINETEEN AND THE LATEST REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE PROJECTIONS INDICATE THAT A TRANSFER CAN BE MADE AND JULY. TWENTY TWENTY THE PLAN IS TO TRANSFER A HUNDRED THOUSAND AS SOON AS A BOARD IS ABLE TO DO SO WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE REQUIRED SIX MONTHS OPERATING EXPENSE RESERVES. OUR ELIZABETH ASCENDS GUILTY SPEAKING TO ISSUE NUMBER. TWO SHOULD CERTIFIED SHORTHAND REPORTER IS BE ALLOWED TO USE VOICE WRITING SYSTEMS. ADDED TO JULY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN MEETING THE BOARD WAS ABLE TO VIEW A DEMONSTRATION OF VOICE WRITING REAL TIME TECHNOLOGY. IT BECAME APPARENT TO THE BOARD THE VOICE WRITING AND STONE A WRITING OR THE SAME SKILL BUT USING DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES TO CAPTURE THEIR SHORT AND WITH STAND ARE WRITING WORDS ARE TAKEN DOWN ENOUGH PHONE ADDICT. BASED SHORTHAND USING SYMBOLS BASED ON LETTERS OF THE ALPHABET. THE STENO WRITER USES A COMPUTER PROGRAM TO BUILD A DICTIONARY THAT RECOGNIZES COMBINATIONS OF LETTERS AND TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH. VOICE WRITERS USE VOICE RECOGNITION SOFTWARE ENOUGH. SIMILAR FASHION THEY PROGRAM THE SOFTWARE TO TRANSLATE THEIR SPOKEN SHORTHAND INTO ENGLISH BECAUSE OF THE SIMILARITY. VOICE WRITERS WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE THE EXACT SAME EXAMINATION IN ORDER TO BECOME CERTIFIED. THE BOARD ORIGINALLY PROPOSED TESTING CURRENT LICENSEES WHO WANT TO SWITCH FROM STUNT ALL WRITING. TO VOICE WRITING BUT DISCOVERED IT DOES NOT HAVE A LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY TO DO SO. LEGISLATIVE STAFF RECOMMENDS DEMONSTRATING COMPETENCY IN EITHER OR BOTH METHODS. GRANDFATHERING IN ALL CURRENT LICENSEES AS STENO WRITER'S A LEGISLATIVE CHANGE WILL BE NEEDED TO AFFIRM THAT CURRENT CERTIFICATE HOLDERS WILL HAVE TO RETEST THE SKILLS PORTION. OF THE EXAM IF THEY WISH TO CHANGE REPORTING METHODOLOGIES% THE BOARD IS HAPPY TO PLACE THE LEGISLATIVE. STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE NECK DURATION. I WILL ALSO BE SPEAKING TO ISSUE NUMBER. THREE SHOULD THE BOARD REQUIRE CERTIFIED SHORTHAND REPORTERS TO MEET NEW CONTINUING EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS. THE CONTINUING EDUCATION REQUIREMENT OF THIRTY HOURS OVER THREE OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD. WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THE REQUIREMENTS TO MAINTAIN NATIONAL CERTIFICATION IS THE BOARD'S RECOMMENDATION. ADDITIONALLY TON OF THOSE HOURS SHOULD BE ETHICS COURSES. THE BOARD SUGGEST A MANDATE FROM THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRING PROOF OF COMPLETION TO BE SENT TO THE BOARD AS A CONDITION OF LICENSE RENEWAL. THE BOARD WILL TRACK TO CONTINUING EDUCATION WITH EXISTING STUFF. BECAUSE THERE IS ALREADY A REQUIREMENT FOR CONTINUING EDUCATION FOR NATIONAL CERTIFICATION AS WELL AS FOR OFFICIAL COURT REPORTERS IN CALIFORNIA. THERE ARE MANY COMPANIES PROVIDING CLASSES OFFERED FOR CONTINUING EDUCATION CREDIT. INCLUDING ONLINE SEMINARS. IT COSTS FOR CONCERNING EDUCATION COURSES VERY STRONG CONFERENCE SEMINAR REGISTRATION FOR STATE AND OR NATIONALLY EVENTS TO FREE TASK GIVEN ON MATERIAL. PROVIDED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION. IN ADDITION TO ALLOWING FOR DISCRETIONARY HARDSHIP WAIVER THE BOARD WOULD WORK WITH SOLID. WHICH IS D. C. A.'S TRAINING UNIT TO DEVELOP TESTING MATERIALS ON BOARD PUBLICATIONS SAYS THAT SUCH AS THEIR NEWSLETTER OR WEBSITE. THE BORED KIDS THAT'S WEBSITE UPDATED WITH ALL CHANGES TO LAWS AND REGULATIONS. AS WELL AS PUBLISHING A NEWSLETTER TWICE A YEAR WITH SUCH CHANGES. THE BOARD ALSO DISTRIBUTES NEW LAW LAWS AND REGULATION CHANGES BY ITS EMAIL SUBSCRIPTION LIST. ALL OF THESE ALTERNATE METHODS OF EDUCATION ARE VOLUNTARY AND ALREADY IN PLACE SUGGESTING THE MANDATORY THING COMPONENT BUT THE NECESSARY TO ENSURE ALL LICENSEES ARE UP TO DATE. I WILL SPEAK TO ISSUE NUMBER SIX IS THE BOARD ABLE TO ENFORCE -- COURT REPORTING STATUTES AGAINST FOREIGN COURT REPORTING CORPORATIONS. THE BOARD HAS HAD A LONG JOURNEY -- IN ITS QUEST TO ENSURE ALL COMPANIES OFFERING COURT REPORTING SERVICES OBEY THE SAME LAWS AND REGULATIONS. GOVERNING COURT REPORTING. STARTING WITH CONVENING A TASK FORCE TO EXPLORE THESE ISSUES AND TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE THE BOARD SUPPORTED AB FOURTEEN SIXTY ONE WHICH ULTIMATELY FELL PASSAGE. HOWEVER IN TWENTY TEN THE BOARD RECEIVED A COMPLAINT AGAINST A U. S. LEGAL FOR VIOLATION OF GIFT GIVING PROVISIONS. AFTER AN INVESTIGATION A CITATION OF FINE WAS ISSUED BUT U. S. LEGAL DENIED THE BOARD'S JURISDICTION. IN TWENTY ELEVEN THE BOARD BROUGHT SUIT AGAINST YOU AS COURT IN THAT MATTER FOUND THAT ALTHOUGH U. S. LEGAL WAS RENDERING COURT REPORTING SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA. AND WAS INDEED IN VIOLATION OF THE GIFT GIVING REGULATIONS -- WHICH I WOULD SAY IS CREATED TO PROTECT CONSUMER EXPLICIT OR EXPRESS AUTHORITY STATUTES. AUTHORIZING THE BOARD TO IMPOSE CITATIONS ARE FINES AGAINST A FOREIGN CORPORATION. THE HEART OF THIS PROBLEM IS WITH THE BOARD'S JURISDICTION OVER THESE NON LICENSEE OWNED OUT OF STATE CORPORATIONS. CORPORATION CO THIRTEEN FOR TEN A REQUIRES PROFESSIONAL CORPORATIONS DEFINED AS THOSE. THAT PROVIDE SERVICES FOR WHICH A LICENSE IS REQUIRED BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME RULES AND REGULATIONS AS LICENSEES. SO WELL BY OF BOTH THE CORPORATION'S CODE AND THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE -- CLEAR THAT LICENSEES AND PROFESSIONAL CORPORATIONS MUST BE HELD TO ALL THE RULES AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO THE PRACTICE OF COURT REPORTING. THE CORPORATIONS IN QUESTION CLAIMED THAT THEY ARE MERELY ARRANGING FOR COURT REPORTING SERVICES AND ARE NOT PROVIDING THEM. THEREFORE THEY ARE EXEMPT FROM ANY LAWS APPLICABLE TO LICENSEES. THIS WOULD MEAN PURSUING AN OBJECTION AGAINST EACH CORPORATION INDIVIDUALLY AND THE COURT WOULD NEED TO DETERMINE ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS AND THAT CORPORATION WE'RE PROVIDING COURT REPORTING SERVICES. CLEARLY A DECISION OF THIS FINANCIAL MAGNITUDE WE NEED TO BE ANALYZED CAREFULLY AND CONJUNCTION WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. THE BOARD WITH THE HELP OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA PURSUED FIRM REGISTRATION AS A SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN IN THE FORM OF AB. SIXTEEN SIXTY THE BILL WAS VETOED BY THEN GOVERNOR BROWN AND A NEW APPROACH WAS TAKEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN AB TWENTY EIGHTY FOUR AGAIN ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA. CHIPPED AWAY AT THIS PROBLEM WITH TARGETING THE MOST EGREGIOUS COMPLAINTS RELATING TO THE INTEGRITY OF THE TRANSCRIPT. THIS SUCCESSFUL SIGNING INTO LAW OF AB -- TWENTY EIGHTY FOUR BY KALRA EFFECTIVELY -- JANUARY FIRST TWENTY NINETEEN WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE BOARD TWO ONE FOUR SPECIFIC STATUTES. AS OUTLAWED OUTLINED IN THE NEW LAW. SPECIFICALLY NO ONE INCLUDING NON LICENSEE OWNED FIRMS MAY CHARGE FOR TRANSCRIPT THAT IS FORMATTED IN VIOLATION OF THE MINIMUM TRANSCRIPT FORMAT STANDARDS WHICH ARE DEFINED IN REGULATION. NORMA THEY CHARGE FEES FOR COURT TRANSCRIPTS THAT ARE NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH FEES SET OUT IN THE GOVERNMENT CODE. ADDITIONALLY ALL TRANSCRIPTS MUST BE MADE AVAILABLE TO ALL PARTIES AT THE SAME TIME AND ALL PARTIES MUST BE NOTIFIED OF A REQUEST FOR PREPARATION OF ALL OR ANY PORTION OF TRANSCRIPT. INCLUDING AT CERTS AND EXPEDITES. WHICH IS EQUITY. WHILE THE RIP REMEDY OF OF FOR THESE VIOLATIONS OF CIVIL LITIGATION RATHER THAN IT AND ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION DIRECTLY FROM THE BOARD. IT IS NOW CLEAR THAT THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS DO APPLY TO THE OUT OF STATE CORPORATIONS AND THERE'S A REMEDY FOR VIOLATION. IT IS SPEND US LEGALS ASSERTION THAT THE SCOPE OF COURT REPORTING IS LIMITED TO BUSINESS PROFESSIONS CODE EIGHT ZERO ONE SEVEN THE MAKING OF SYMBOLS ON A MACHINE. THE REST OF THAT CODE INCLUDES AND THE TRANSCRIPTION THEY'RE OFF MAKING IT CLEAR THAT THE TRANSCRIPT IS IN THE CENTRAL PART OF COURT REPORTING DUTIES. NOT ONLY SUPERIOR COURT AND COURT REPORTERS BOARD VERSUS US LEGAL BUT ALSO THE APPELLATE COURT AND MOOSE VERSUS US LEGAL FOUND. THAT US LEGAL IS OFFERING COURT REPORTING SERVICES. WELL THIS WOULD BE SUPPORT FOR AN ARGUMENT OF THE BOARD'S JURISDICTION UNDER MOSCONI KNOCKS IT SHOULD BE POINTED OUT THAT THE MOOSE DECISION ISN'T ON PUBLISHED DECISION. AND MAY NOT BE RELIED UPON BY THE COURT. WE ARE INVESTED IN FIGURING THIS OUT. THE BOARD HAS RECEIVED COMPLAINTS FROM COURT REPORTERS WHO ALLEGE THE BUSINESS PRACTICES OF THE FOREIGN CORPORATIONS ARE PUTTING THEM OUT OF BUSINESS. EACH COMPLAINT IS INVESTIGATED ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS. BUT IF THE BOARD WERE TO PURSUE SOME TYPE OF IN JUNCTION IT SEEMS TWO THINGS MAY HAPPEN. FIRSTTHE COURT HEARING THE CASE COULD NARROWLY INTERPRET THE DEFINITION OF COURT REPORTING SET OUT AND BE P.. EIGHTY SEVEN TEN IN WHICH CASE THE FOREIGN CORPORATIONS ARE NOT PROVIDING SERVICES AND THERE'S NO BASIS UPON WHICH TO REQUIRE LICENSING. SHOULD THE COURT FIND THAT THEY ARE PROVIDING COURT REPORTING SERVICES THE BOARD WOULD THEN HAVE JURISDICTION ARE UNDER MOSCONI KNOCKS. CERTAINLY NO REAL GAIN TO CONSUMERS COMES FROM EITHER RESULTS. THE BOARD FILL SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE WITH THE PASSAGE OF AB. TWENTY EIGHTY FOUR AND WILL CLOSELY MONITOR ON ANY AND ALL VIOLATIONS. THE BOARD EMBRACES ITS CONSUMER PROTECTION MISSION AND HAS WORKED HARD TO PARLAY SCARCE AND LIMITED RESOURCES. INTO THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT OPERATION POSSIBLE. THE BOARD CONCURS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE STAFFS ASSERTION THAT THE HEALTH SAFETY AND WELFARE OF THE PUBLIC ARE BETTER PROTECTED BY WELL REGULATED COURT REPORTING PROFESSION. THE BOARD IS COMMITTED TO THE MISSION IS GIVEN BY THE LEGISLATURE SIXTY FIVE YEARS AGO. AND LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING WITH LEGISLATIVE ANY CONCERNS MAY FIND ARISING OUT OF THIS REVIEW. WE'RE OPEN FOR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME FOR MANY MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. SEE NO QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THIS TIME WITH ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC WISH TO SPEAK. AT THIS TIME PLEASE FEEL FREE TO COME UP TO THE MICROPHONE. AND NAME AND AFFILIATION IF YOU WISH TO PROVIDE IT. MISTER CHAIRMAN. MEMBERS THE MORNING. MY NAME IS KELLY SHANE LINE. I AM A FREELANCE COURT REPORTER AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE DEPOSITION REPORTERS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. THE LARGEST INFERS ORGANIZATION IN THE NATION DEVOTED SOLELY TO FREELANCE COR PORTERS AND FREELANCE OWN SMALL BUSINESSES. MEMBERS WE SUPPORT THE EXTENSION OF THE BOARD AND THANK THE BOARD FOR ITS HARD WORK. HOWEVER THE LAWS THAT PROTECT MY PROFESSIONAL ETHICS FROM BEING COMPROMISED BY A CORPORATION'S DUTY TO MAXIMIZE SHAREHOLDER VALUE. ARE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THE LAWS THAT PROTECT LAWYERS CPA'S AND DOCTORS AND EVERY OTHER PROFESSION UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS. JESSE THE AMAZON OR A VENTURE CAPITAL FUND CANNOT LEGALLY OWN A CORPORATION THAT PROVIDES FOR LEGAL SERVICES FROM LAWYERS ARE MEDICAL SERVICES FROM DOCTORS. THE LAW IS CLEAR THAT CORPORATIONS NOT OWNED BY LICENSEES CANNOT RENDER MY SERVICES EITHER. BUT THEY ARE EVERYWHERE DOING IT ALL THE TIME. OUT IN THE OPEN FROM STATES FAR AWAY ILLEGALLY. MOST IMPORTANTLY IT IS HARMING CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. THE RESULT CORPORATIONS NOT LICENSEES ARE UNLAWFULLY COMPETING AGAINST AND DRIVING OUT OF BUSINESS LICENSEE OWNED FIRMS. OWNED BY OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT OBEY THE LAWS YOU RIGHT OR RISK LOSING THEIR LICENSE. THE CORPORATIONS HIGHER SLICK COMMISSION SALES PEOPLE WHO OFFER ILLEGAL KICKBACKS THAT IF I OFFERED WOULD GET MY LICENSE REVOKED. AND MOST RECENTLY THEY'RE PUSHING SUBPAR DIGITAL RECORDING THAT IS UNRELIABLE AND INADMISSIBLE IN COURT WHEREAS WHAT I DO IS PRODUCE THE OFFICIAL RECORD. MEMBERS THIS IS AN EGREGIOUS MISS REPRESENTATION AND RESTAURANT. IN CONCLUSION PLEASE HELP US AND PLEASE REMEMBER JUST HAVING CORPORATIONS REGISTER A PIECE OF PAPER IS NOT ENOUGH. THERE WILL NEVER EVER BE A FAIR AND EQUAL INCENTIVE TO OBEY THE LAWS YOU RIGHT BETWEEN LICENSEE OWNED FIRMS AND A CORPORATION UNLESS THERE IS A REAL LIFE PERSON IN THE CORPORATION. LIKE ME WHO COULD LOSE THEIR LICENSE AND LIVELIHOOD JUST LIKE I COULD IF I VIOLATE THE LAW. THAT IS THE WAY LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE OTHER PROFESSION YOU OVERSEE DOES IT MEMBERS RESPECTFULLY WHY SHOULD IT BE ANY DIFFERENT FOR ME. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. GOOD MORNING I'M SELLING A COUPLE AN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE LEGAL AID ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE HERE TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE EXTENSION OF THE SUNSET. ON A SPEAK VERY BRIEFLY ON ISSUES ONE AND TWO SO MY ORGANIZATION REPRESENTS ROUGHLY ONE HUNDRED LEGAL AID ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MANY IN YOUR AREA SO YOU KNOW THEM -- AND THEY ACTUALLY SERVE OVER ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS EVERY YEAR PROVIDING FREE LEGAL SERVICES ON ISSUES RANGING FROM -- IMMIGRATION ISSUES TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DISPUTES TO HELPING PEOPLE MAINTAIN THEIR HOUSING -- AND WE HAVE ALWAYS SUPPORTED EFFORTS IN THE PAST TO PROTECT AND EXPAND THE TRANSCRIPT REIMBURSEMENT FUND IT'S ISSUE.

ON OVER DOESN'T LEGAL AID ORGANIZATION SUBMITTED LETTERS TO SUPPORT THE FUND AND ORGANIZATIONS HAVE SHARED WITH ME THAT THEY HAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN UNREIMBURSED EXPENSES WHILE THE PHONE IS ON HOLD. I'M SOME HAVE OVER TO YOUR TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND UP TO A HUNDRED THOUSAND AND UNREIMBURSED EXPENSES. I'M GONNA LEGALLY PROGRAM DOES NOT HAVE TO SPEND IT SCARCE RESOURCES ON EXPENSIVE COURT TRANSCRIPTS IT FREES UP THOSE FUNDS TO SERVE PEOPLE IN NEED SO WE ARE. I'M IN SUPPORT OF THE THE SUNSET EXTEND THE SUNSETFOR THAT REASON THE BRIEFLY ON ISSUE. TOO I THINK IT'S COMMON SENSE TO ADAPT TO NEW TECHNOLOGY IS ESPECIALLY THE CASE OF ALLOWING THE VOICE. TRANSCRIPT BECAUSE THAT EXPANDS ACCESS TO JUSTICE WITH A SHORTAGE OF COURT REPORTERS THROUGHOUT OUR STATE THIS ACTUALLY WOULD EXPAND THE BODY PEOPLE WHO ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE A WRITTEN RECORD. A VERBATIM RECORD OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE COURT WHICH IS WHAT YOU NEED TO APPEAL A LOWER COURT HOLDING. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WE ACT AS A SUPPORT CENTER FOR MANY OF THE DIFFERENT LEGAL AID ORGANIZATIONS AND WOULD LIKE TO ALIGN OUR COMMENTS.

OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE LAW OFFICES A CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE INCORPORATED IS A STATE WIDE LEGAL SERVICES PROGRAM PROVIDING VITAL. NEEDED LEGAL SERVICES TO LOW INCOME RESIDENTS IMMIGRANTS AND FARMWORKERS THROUGHOUT THE RURAL COUNTIES FROM EL CENTRO AND THE SOUTH UP TO YUBA CITY. NORTH HE IS A MODESTLY FUNDED LEGAL SERVICES PROGRAM. AND YET THEY ARE SERVING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN NEED OF LOW INCOME SERVICES. IN THESE -- DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. WITHOUT THE TRANSCRIPT REIMBURSEMENT FUND CRLA WILL BE DISADVANTAGED FROM PROVIDING QUALITY LEGAL SERVICES TO ITS CLIENTS. THESE CLIENTS FARMWORKERS IMMIGRANTS POOR PEOPLE. NEED THE SERVICES SO THEY CAN GET EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE. CURRENTLY FAIRLY INCORPORATED HAS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN UNMET NEED.

MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SHANE GUSMAN ON BEHALF OF THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERAL FEDERATION OF PROFESSIONAL AND TECHNICAL ENGINEERS -- THIS IS A UNION THAT REPRESENTS COURT REPORTERS -- IN SAN FRANCISCO EMPLOYED BY THE COURT WE STRONGLY SUPPORT EXTENDING THE SUNSET OF THE WE DO WANT TO RAISE ONE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE ON THE VOICE WRITING ISSUE -- WE WE HAVE A CONCERN THAT THAT THAT WAS REYES TODAY -- BY THE BOARD ITSELF ABOUT STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO GO FORWARD WE BELIEVE THAT THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY NEEDS TO BE GRANTED AND WE NEED TO HAVE A SLOWER PROCESS SO THAT WE CAN DEVELOP THE RIGHT PROGRAM THAT PROTECTS CONSUMERS. THE WAY IT'S MOVING FORWARD RIGHT NOW. WE THINK HAS SOME ISSUES WITH IT SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE BOARD. THE COMMITTEE AND DEPARTMENT AS WE MOVE FORWARD THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MEMBER MEMBERS MY NAME IS RACHEL BAR KIßM I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA COURT REPORTERS ASSOCIATION ALSO KNOWN AS THE CRA. AS HE'S VERY SUPPORTS THE EXTENSION OF THE SUNSET FOR THIS YEAR BE HOWEVER THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AS YOU HAVE DISCUSSED TODAY. HE'S VERY STRONGLY SUPPORTS% MANDATING IS CONTINUING EDUCATION WE KNOW FIRST HAND THAT LICENSEES ARE VERY INTERESTED IN ENSURING THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF PROFESSIONAL COMPETENCE. AND WE HOLD REGULAR CONTINUING EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES FOR STATE FOR AT CALIFORNIA'S CERTIFIED SHORTHAND REPORTERS. AS HE ALSO BELIEVES IT IS TIME TO FORMALLY LICENSE CART CAPTION OURS IN CALIFORNIA. THIS YEAR BE AS LONG TERM PLAN INCLUDES THIS ISSUE BUT HAS NOT YET HAPPENED. CART CAPTION OR SERVE AS CRITICAL BRIDGES BETWEEN CALIFORNIA'S DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING COMMUNITY AND COURT PROCEEDINGS EDUCATIONAL AND OTHER SERVICES. LICENSE COURT REPORTERS OFTEN PROVIDE THESE SERVICES AND SEIZE YOUR A AS AN ASSOCIATION PROVIDES TRAINING AND TESTING BUT THE CRB DOES NOT. WE URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN KLAY ENVOYS WRITERS CAESAR ASKS THAT YOU MOVED AS SWIFTLY FOR COURT FOR CART CAPTION EARNS. I WE ALSO AGREE WITH THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION TO MAKE NECESSARY STATUTORY CHANGES TO INCORPORATE VOICE WRITERS AND THE NEED FOR A SPECIALIZED TEST BEFORE A LICENSEE IS PERMITTED TO UTILIZE THIS TECHNOLOGY. WE ALSO BELIEVE THE CRB NEEDS TO CLARIFY THIS REQUIREMENT FOR CURRENT LICENSEES TO ENSURE THAT SOMEONE CAN OPERATE AS A VOICE WRITER ONLY AFTER SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETING A SPECIFIC SKILLS TEST THANK YOU SO MUCH. BUT YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE HERNANDEZ ALSO BEHALF OF CCRI -- JUST A COUPLE THINGS ON THE TRANSCRIPT REIMBURSEMENT FUND -- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE CALIFORNIA CORPORATE SOCIO ASIANS VERY STRONG SUPPORT OF OF AND WE BELIEVE NOT ONLY THAT THE FUNDING SHOULD BE RESTORED. BUT THE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR STATUTORY LEVEL SHOULD BE INCREASED TO FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND IS REALLY -- DISAPPOINTING AND TROUBLESOME THAT WE HAVE SO MANY LOW INCOME LITIGANTS IN CALIFORNIA HER UNABLE TO GET ACCESS TO TRANSCRIPTS OR CAN AFFORD TRANSCRIPTS. ON OVER THE LAST YEAR TO THEY'VE BEEN UNABLE TO DO THAT WE MADE EFFORTS LAST YEAR TO GET SOME MONEY IN THE BUDGET. TO SUPPLEMENT -- THE TERROR HALF OF THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN -- UNFORTUNATELY NOW THAT THE ON ALL LICENSEES -- THE FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS SHOULD BE PUTTING MONEY INTO THE T. R. HALF PERIOD BEFORE ANY EXPANSION ON ANYTHING ELSE OTHER SERVICES. THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN NEEDS TO HAPPEN AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND LOOK AT ANY OTHER WAY TO PUT TO PUT SOME FUNDING INTO THE TRF -- I THINK AS SOMEONE SAID EARLIER THE JAMISON DECISION UNDERSCORES THE IMPORTANCE OF PROVIDING ALL THE RESOURCES TO LOW INCOME THAT AGAINST CALIFORNIA -- AND SO THIS IS QUITE VERY VERY CRITICAL NEED TO BE DONE -- AS FAR AS THE OUT OF STATE OF FIRMS ARE OPERATING WE CONCUR WITH THE BOARD'S COMMENTS -- THAT YOU SOME GOOD STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN WE WERE WITH THE BOARD ON THE CALIBER BILLS WE SPONSOR OWN BILLS AS WELL. AND ANYTHING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO FURTHER STRENGTHEN WE WANT TO BE A PART OF IT WE NEED TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION SO ANYTHING MORE THAN NEEDS TO BE DONE.

GOOD MORNING MICHELLE CAST OF THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION WE REPRESENT COURT REPORTERS AND THIRTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND I'M ETERNALLY ONE ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS MADE BY. MISTER HERNANDEZ -- C. C. RATE AND MISTER GLASSMAN. I JUST WANNA MAKE ONE COMMENT -- REGARDING RECEIVE SHORTAGE OF COURT REPORTERS -- I THINK THAT THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY -- SIX THOUSAND LICENSE COURT REPORTERS IN CALIFORNIA AND SOMEONE THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF I THINK WHAT -- FOURTEEN HUNDRED JUDGES IN CALIFORNIA. AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING IN SEEING IN EACH TRIAL COURT THAT HAS HAD OPENINGS FOR COURT REPORTERS THERE'S A MULTITUDE OF APPLICANTS FOR EXAMPLE. I READ IN THE REPORT JUST THIS MORNING FOR ONE OPEN POSITION IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY SIXTY NINE APPLICANTS APPLIED FOR THAT JOB COURTS ARE HIRING COURT REPORTERS -- SO WE DON'T THINK THAT THERE IS A SHORTAGE NOW THERE IS A PERCEPTION OF A SHORTAGE BECAUSE SOME COUNTIES HAVE A HARD TIME RECRUITING COURT REPORTERS. BECAUSE THE WAGES ARE LOW THE COMMUTES FAR OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT BUT GENERAL I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT WE SUPPORT THE EXTENSION OF THE CENTER FOR THE C. R. PORT THANK YOU. THIS RETURN MEMBERS UP MIKE BILLOWED ON BEHALF OF A COALITION OF COURT REPORTING ENTITIES -- YOU KNOW FIRST SUCH SHOULD DISCRETE AREA OF COMMERCE COURT REPORTING RAISES AN AMAZING ARRAY OF ISSUES. THAT ARE A CHALLENGE FOR THE LEGISLATURE IN A TECHNOLOGY IS ONE OF THEM AND YOU'VE HEARD. IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT VIEWS OF TECHNOLOGY IS THERE A SHORTAGE -- WELL YOU YOU MAY TALK ABOUT OFFICIAL REPORTERS IN COURTS BUT WE'RE TOLD THERE'S SOMETHING OF A SHORTAGE IN THE DEPOSITION WORLD IN THE FREELANCERS -- YOU HAVE A VERY VERY LOW PASS RATE FOR PEOPLE ATTEMPTING TO BECOME COURT REPORTERS AND THAT OUGHT TO BE LOOKED AT THE QUESTION OF OUT OF STATEI REPRESENT AS MS HURT NOTED -- THE MOOSE DECISION WHICH IS ON APPEAL -- IS A NON PUBLISHED CASE AND WE WILL PLEDGE TO WORK WITH THE BOARD AND WITH THE STAKEHOLDER GROUPS TO ARRIVE AT A SATISFACTORY OUTCOME. THAT CAN NOT EXACERBATE THE SHORTAGE CONTINUE TO ALLOW LAWYERS TO HIRE A FREELANCE COURT REPORTERS TO HANDLE DEPOSITIONS IN A WAY THAT PROTECTS THE PUBLIC -- AND WE'VE TALKED TO YOUR STAFF ABOUT IT WE THINK THERE'S A PATH AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO FINDING THAT PATH TOGETHER THANK YOU.

I KNOW THAT WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE DIALOGUE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR COMMITTEE STAFF THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE ORDER OF OUR BEING HERE WE LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THEN OF THE FINALLY ITEM NUMBER SIX WHICH IS THE A REVIEW OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS -- WE HAVE OUR DIRECTOR OF DCA HERE IN EUROPE. AND IN THE INTEREST OF TIME DIRECTOR CALL FEEL OPPRESSED YOU CAN JUST GET INTO SOME OF THESE ISSUES AS YOU SEE FIT -- THE CALL COX'S ARE GONNA BE -- CONVENING HERE SH VERY SHORTLY -- SO BE AS BRIEF AS WE SHOULD BE ISSUES. ABSOLUTELY -- SENSITIVE OF OFFICE THE NEED FOR MEMBERS TO BE CAUCUS AND I'LL JUMP RIGHT INTO THE ISSUE. FIRST THE COMMITTEE HAS ASKED THE CA TO COMMENT ON ITS EFFORTS RELATED TO DYNAMICS THE DYNAMICS DECISION ESTABLISHING NEW TEST FOR DETERMINING. WHETHER A WORKER. IS AN EMPLOYEE OR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR FOR PURPOSES OF CALIFORNIA WAGE ORDERS. WE DON'T ANTICIPATE THAT THE DYNAMICS DECISION WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT PROFESSIONAL LICENSEES SUCH AS DOCTORS DENTISTS AND OF TOM TRYST. BUT IT COULD IMPACT OTHER OCCUPATIONAL LICENSEES UNDER THE DEPARTMENT. BECAUSE TIME EXCISION WITH GENERAL EFECTO CERTAIN OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING LICENSEES STRUCTURES AND OR AN ORGANIZER BUSINESSES AND EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIPS. RATHER THAN HOW THE BOARDS REGULATE THE LICENSEES MOST AFFECTED BORE MOST AFFECTED BOARDS ARE TAKING A WAIT AND SEE APPROACH. DISCOVER THE DYNAMIC DIED DYNAMICS DECISION IS STILL BEING REFINED BY THE COURTS AND THE DEPARTMENT WILL BE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE APPROPRIATE GLACIER LABOR AGENCIES. TO DETERMINE THE APPLICATION OF THE DECISION AND THE POSSIBLE IMPACT OF LICENSEES UNDER THE DEPARTMENT. THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL NATIONS HAS A MORE DIRECT ROLE IN INTERPRETING AND PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON THESE BUSINESS AND EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIPS. HOWEVER THE DEPARTMENT HAS RESPONDED TO QUESTIONS FROM BOARDS ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS ON THE MEANING AND POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF THE DECISION. THE DEPARTMENT CONFERRED WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE ON THE IMPACTS OF THE DECISION TO THE CONTRACTOR STATE LICENSING BOARD. THEY JUST THE DECISION WAS ALSO DISCUSSED EXTENSIVELY BY THE BORDER BARBERINI COSMETOLOGY. AND THE DEPARTMENT PROVIDED GUIDANCE TO THE BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY REGARDING POTENTIAL IMPACTS. THE DEPARTMENT IS CLOSELY TRACKING LEGISLATION THIS YEAR ON THE ISSUE AND RIVER AND WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE TO PROGRAMS HAS NEED. THE SECOND ISSUE LIKE TO ADDRESS FOCUS THAT FOCUSES ON PUBLIC ACCESS TO MEETINGS FOR OUR VARIOUS PROGRAMS. THE DEPARTMENT IS PROUD OF THE COLLABORATION WITH OUR PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE HUNDREDS OF OPEN MEETINGS EACH YEAR. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ALONE OUR PROGRAMS HELP THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX MEETINGS AND ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY MEETINGS WERE AVAILABLE VIA WEBCAST. THESE MEETINGS WERE HELD UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN VARIOUS REGIONS INCLUDING THE BAY AREA. SACRAMENTO THE CENTRAL VALLEY LOS ANGELES AND SAN DIEGO. IN AN EFFORT TO INCREASE ACCESS SOME PRO MEETINGS ON ON THE WEEKEND SUCH AS THE DENTAL HYGIENE. DENTAL HYGIENE BOARD OF CALIFORNIA AND THE BOARD OF BARBARY IN COSMETOLOGY. DO YOU SEE A MEETING WEBCASTS ARE AVAILABLE ON A SINGLE SITE. ALONG WITH A LINK TO THE BOARD OF BOARD OR BUREAU AND VICE WE COMMITTEES AGENDA. THESE WEBCASTS ARE ALSO PROMOTED ON DO YOU SEE A SOCIAL MEDIA PAGES AND THE WEB CASTS ARE ARCHIVED ON PCA'S YOUTUBE CHANNEL. WELL WE SEEK TO BROADCAST AS MANY MEETINGS AS POSSIBLE DUE TO THE HIGH VOLUME OF MEETINGS FROM OUR DEPARTMENT. WE ARE ABLE TO DO SO FOR EVERY MEAL EASY FOR EVERY MEETING AS IT WOULD PREVENT IT WOULD PRESENT A RESOURCE AND BUDGETARY CHALLENGE FOR THE DEPARTMENT AND ITS PROGRAMS. DC CONTINUES TO BE OPEN TO DISCUSSIONS REGARDING EXPANDING WHAT CASTING OR OTHER TECHNOLOGIES TO ALLOW GREATER PUBLIC ASK ACCESS. TO BOARD MEETS. MY GOAL IS TO ENSURE THAT CONSUMERS AND INTERESTED STAKEHOLDERS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE IN PERSON VIA WEBCAST BY TELECONFERENCE. OR OTHER METHODS THAT ACHIEVE. INCREASED ACCESS. I'M INTERESTED IN BROUGHT IN OUR REACH TO ENSURE ALL CONSUMERS CAN PARTICIPATE IN DECISIONS THAT ARE PARAMOUNT TO CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. THE NEXT ISSUE LIKE TO DISCUSSES DCA SOCIAL MEDIA MANAGEMENT POLICY. AND HOW THE DEPARTMENT SUPPORTS OUR MONITORS THE BUREAU'S SOCIAL MEDIA PAGES. DCA DOES HAVE SOCIAL MEDIA GUIDELINES THAT UP HELLO THAT CALL GIRLS FOLLOW. IN OUR BOARDS ARE ENCOURAGED TO ADOPT THESE GUIDELINES IS NEEDED TO SERVE THEIR PARTICULAR NEEDS. OUR GUIDELINES ADDRESS ISSUES RELATED TO ACCOUNTABILITY. ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT. CONTENT IN SUPPORT FOR ADMINISTRATORS AND PUBLISHERS. ADDITIONALLY DC HAS GUIDELINES IN PLACE RELATED TO CONTENT THAT MAY BE DEEMED INAPPROPRIATE VULGAR OR INFLAMMATORY. WITHIN THE LAST YEAR THE DEPARTMENT IS HIRED AN INFORMATION OFFICER. TO DEDICATE MORE TIME TO THE DEPARTMENTS AND PROGRAMS SOCIAL MEDIA STRATEGY. THE INFORMATION OFFICER MONITORS AND REVIEWS ANALYTICS TO DETERMINE WHAT TYPE OF POST GET THE BEST ENGAGEMENT. AND HELPS THE OTHER INFORMATION OFFICERS INTENT FOR THEIR CLIENTS. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN DC'S INFORMATION OFFICERS GROUP CREATED NEARLY ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SIXTY SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS DIRECTLY BENEFITING OUR CLIENTS. THAT ARE POSTED ON PCA'S SOCIAL MEDIA SITES. THE BOARDS IN DERECHOS OWN THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA PRESENCES AND IN SOME RARE CASES. WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT THAT THE DEPARTMENT'S INFORMATION OFFICERS ARE ALLOWED TO POST ON THEIR BEHALF. DISEASE INFORMATION OFFICERS MONITOR SOCIAL MEDIA PAGES REGULARLY. THEY WERE CLOSELY WITH THE BOYS IN BUREAU SAID ABOUT CONTENT AND REGULARLY PROVIDE SUGGESTED POSTS. DCA WAS RECENTLY MADE AWARE OF POSTS ON BSI **** FACEBOOK PAGE THAT ARE DISTASTEFUL AND CONVEYED THAT THE PAGE MAY NOT BE MONITORED BY THE BUREAU. AS SOON AS WE WERE NOTIFIED THE DCA COMMUNICATIONS DIVISION CONNECTED WITH THE B. S. I. S. TO CREATE A PLAN TO ESTABLISH HIS SOCIAL MEDIA PLAN MOVING FORWARD. NEXT I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO THE EFFORTS DCA IS DOING TO IMPLEMENT AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY EIGHT AUTHORED BY SOME IN WHICH YOU ENSURE LOW.

THE CITY IS LEGAL AND LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS DIVISIONS HAVE CONVENE VARIOUS MEETINGS WITH BOARD EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AMPERE CHIEFS. TO IDENTIFY MAJOR CHALLENGES AND ASSIST IN IMPLEMENTATION. DO YOU SEE A HAS PROVIDED GUIDANCE ON POTENTIAL REGULATORY PASS AND MODEL LANGUAGE TO ASSIST IN DEVELOPING REGULATIONS.

BASED ON BOARD MEETING SCHEDULES. THE DEPARTMENT IS TRACKING THE IMPLEMENTATION BY ITS BOARD AND GROW SO WE STAY ON TARGET. DO YOU SEE A ESTIMATED A. B. C. P. TO CREATE A DEDICATED. REGULATIONS UNIT THAT WOULD BE SOLELY FOCUSED ON REGULATIONS. AND PARTICULARLY FOCUSED ON AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY EIGHT BERMAN TATIAN. DC ANTICIPATES WORKING ON A AT LEAST FORTY REGULATORY PACKAGES AS A RESULT OF AB. TWENTY ONE THIRTY EIGHT WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT EVERY BOARD IMPAIR WAS WORKING TOWARDS DEVELOPING REGULATIONS IN TIME TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY JULY. ONE TWENTY TWENTY FINALLY I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS INCLUDING BREEZE AND HIGHLIGHTING OUR WORK ON BUSINESS MODERNIZATION. TWENTY OF DC'S BOARDS AND BUREAUS ARE A BREEZE. 92% OF ONLINE OR NEW APPLICATIONS FOR THE BOARDS IN BUREAUS ARE PROCESS THE SAME DAY. WITHOUT STAFF IN YOUR BED WITHOUT STAFF INTERVENTION. THAT IS A HUGE WIN. SEVENTEEN BOARDS IN BUREAUS ARE NOT EMBRACE. MORE THAN TWO YEARS AGO DCA MADE THE DECISION NOT TO FORCE THESE PROGRAMS ON TO REDUCE. INSTEAD EACH PROGRAM IS GOING THROUGH CALIFORNIA APARTMENT TECHNOLOGIES PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE. EACH PROGRAM IS DEVELOPING INDIVIDUAL PLANS TO MODERNIZE THEIR BUSINESS LANDSCAPE WITH A CAR WITH A COMBINATION OF PROCESS RE ENGINEERING. AND TECHNICAL LOGICAL VAST ADVANCEMENTS. THE INDIVIDUAL PLANS WERE DELIVERED TO A LEGISLATURE IN DECEMBER. TWENTY SEVENTEEN STATUS UPDATES FOR PROVIDED IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN FOR PROGRAMS HAVE COMPLETED STAGE. TWO AND TWO PROGRAMS HAVE COMPLETED STAGE ONE THESE PROGRAMS ENTHUSIASTICALLY SUPPORT THE CURRENT BUSINESS MODERNIZATION PLANS. I'M CONFIDENT WE ARE NOW ON THE RIGHT TRACK.
