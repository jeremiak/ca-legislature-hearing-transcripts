00:23:59.971 --> 00:24:01.139
IS TO TARGET THE COURTS THAT ARE

00:24:01.206 --> 00:24:02.407
BELOW THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE

00:24:02.474 --> 00:24:04.042
WHICH IS THE WAY THAT WE

00:24:04.109 --> 00:24:05.210
APPROACH IT IN TWO THOUSAND

00:24:05.277 --> 00:24:06.344
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. BUT ANOTHER

00:24:06.411 --> 00:24:08.647
WAY IS ALSO TO BRING- ALL COURTS

00:24:08.713 --> 00:24:15.253
UP TO A MINIMUM. KNESSET LEVEL.

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:16.454
IN ADDITION TO THIS ALSO THAT

00:24:16.521 --> 00:24:17.222
THERE ARE OTHER PRIOR THAT COULD

00:24:17.289 --> 00:24:20.025
BECOMES. SHE WE ARE. YOU KNOW AT

00:24:20.091 --> 00:24:21.960
X. SOME OF THE- WERE TO THE

00:24:22.027 --> 00:24:23.528
PANDEMIC'S RELATED TO BACKLOG

00:24:23.595 --> 00:24:25.530
AND DELAYS IN COURT PROCEEDINGS

00:24:25.597 --> 00:24:26.498
AND SO THAT COULD BE AN AREA

00:24:26.565 --> 00:24:28.633
WHERE WE MIGHT WANT. TO MINIMIZE

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:30.569
IMPACTS ON COURT COURT USERS AND

00:24:30.635 --> 00:24:31.837
THAT'S ADDRESSING EQUITY IN

00:24:31.903 --> 00:24:32.971
DIFFERENT WAY YOU KNOW EQUITY IN

00:24:33.038 --> 00:24:34.306
TERMS OF PUBLIC ACCESS AND HOW

00:24:34.372 --> 00:24:35.941
QUICKLY EACH CASE CAN BE

00:24:36.007 --> 00:24:38.677
RESOLVED. SO IN LINE WITH THIS

00:24:38.743 --> 00:24:40.145
ONE OPTION THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:24:40.212 --> 00:24:42.047
COULD CONSIDER IS TO PROVIDE

00:24:42.113 --> 00:24:43.882
SOME OR ALL OF THE REQUESTED

00:24:43.949 --> 00:24:46.084
FUNDING IN THE BUDGET YEAR. TO

00:24:46.151 --> 00:24:47.886
ADDRESS PANDEMIC RELATED IMPACTS

00:24:47.953 --> 00:24:48.787
AND TO KIND OF HELP WITH THAT

00:24:48.854 --> 00:24:50.155
THE LEGISLATURE COULD ASK THE

00:24:50.222 --> 00:24:51.990
JUDICIAL BRANCH TO REPORT IN THE

00:24:52.057 --> 00:24:53.859
SPRING. TO BASICALLY IDENTIFY

00:24:53.925 --> 00:24:55.427
WHERE THE GREATEST NEEDS ARE AND

00:24:55.493 --> 00:24:57.629
THEN AFTER THE BUDGET YEAR THE

00:24:57.696 --> 00:24:59.464
FUNDS CAN BE ALLOCATED- YOU KNOW

00:24:59.531 --> 00:25:00.699
FOR EXAMPLE TO BRING ALL OF THE

00:25:00.765 --> 00:25:03.368
COURTS. TO AT LEAST EIGHTY FOUR

00:25:03.435 --> 00:25:05.370
POINT FIVE PERCENT. OF THE NEED

00:25:05.437 --> 00:25:07.072
WHICH IS WHAT YOU KNOW A HUNDRED

00:25:07.138 --> 00:25:08.406
MILLION DOLLARS POTENTIALLY

00:25:08.473 --> 00:25:10.008
COULD BRING THEM YEAH. SO WITH

00:25:10.075 --> 00:25:14.179
THAT WE'RE. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

00:25:14.246 --> 00:25:15.814
QUESTIONS THANK YOUNG. THANK YOU

PHYSICIST PARTIBLE- LARGER-

00:25:37.235 --> 00:25:39.471

ADJUSTMENTS ACROSS DEPARTMENTS

00:25:41.139 --> 00:25:43.742

00:25:47.879 --> 00:25:49.681
TAKEN UP CITIES CDCR

00:25:49.748 --> 00:25:51.816
TRANSPORTATION OTHER THINGS SO

00:25:51.883 --> 00:25:54.085

00:26:01.226 --> 00:26:04.896
SOMETHING UNIQUE TO- THE

00:26:04.963 --> 00:26:06.598

SPECIFIC TOOK THE INITIAL

00:26:14.973 --> 00:26:17.475
COUNSEL ACCOUNT- ED CAN SPIT IT

00:26:17.542 --> 00:26:19.210
CERTAINLY NOT PART OF A BROADER

00:26:19.277 --> 00:26:22.380
STATEWIDE ADJUSTMENT- I'M NOT TO

00:26:22.447 --> 00:26:23.782
SAY THAT THERE THERE THERE CAN'T

00:26:23.848 --> 00:26:26.318

00:26:26.384 --> 00:26:30.188
SPECIFICALLY FOR THE REPORTS.

00:26:30.255 --> 00:26:34.326

MAYBE CURTI IS A BETTER WORD- IT

00:26:40.065 --> 00:26:42.233
AND ALSO KIND OF A ME TOO

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:44.035
ATTITUDE I DON'T KNOW WHY IF

00:26:44.102 --> 00:26:45.870
IT'S IF IT'S TRULY AN

00:26:45.937 --> 00:26:48.974
INFLATIONARY ADJUSTMENT-

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:50.141
NOBODY'S FAULT OTHER THAN THE

00:26:50.208 --> 00:26:52.410
FACT THAT WE HAVE INFLATION IN A

00:26:52.477 --> 00:26:53.244
THREE POINT 8% IS AN ACCURATE

00:26:53.311 --> 00:26:56.014
NUMBER. WHY WOULDN'T THAT APPLY

00:26:56.081 --> 00:26:59.050
TO THE COST OF BREAD FOR A

00:26:59.117 --> 00:27:00.986
PRISON INMATES SOME- HERE

00:27:01.052 --> 00:27:03.488
TRANSPORTATION PROJECT COSTS AND

00:27:03.555 --> 00:27:05.090
ALL KINDS OF OTHER THINGS SO.

00:27:05.156 --> 00:27:06.992
I'M I DON'T KNOW IF THE ILLEGAL

00:27:07.058 --> 00:27:08.526
HAS A COMMENT ON THAT BUT IF IT

00:27:08.593 --> 00:27:11.363
WAS THAT RAISED AT ALL IN THE

00:27:11.429 --> 00:27:12.030
ALEJO'S OFFICE SAID. BUT PERHAPS

00:27:12.097 --> 00:27:14.466
THERE SHOULD BE SOME CONCERN

00:27:14.532 --> 00:27:17.335
ABOUT THE PRESIDENT OF A UNIQUE

00:27:17.402 --> 00:27:19.004
INFLATIONARY ADJUSTMENT FOR ONE

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:22.340
PARTICULAR- PIECE OF THE BUDGET

. THE OVERALL BUDGET. SO ARE

00:27:28.446 --> 00:27:30.582
UNDER ISSUE ON THIS ISSUE- THE

00:27:30.648 --> 00:27:32.617
JUDICIAL BRANCH IS A LITTLE BIT

00:27:32.684 --> 00:27:34.152
DIFFERENT FROM SOME OF THE OTHER

00:27:34.219 --> 00:27:36.488
DEPARTMENTS SO WHEN YOU CONSIDER

00:27:36.554 --> 00:27:38.423
DEPARTMENTS LIKE CITY C. R. THE

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:40.625
LEGISLATURE DOES APPROVED- AND

00:27:40.692 --> 00:27:42.360
WILL USE AGREEMENTS RELATED TO

00:27:42.427 --> 00:27:44.329
SALARIES- AND THEIR OTHER

00:27:44.396 --> 00:27:45.463
DISCUSSIONS RELATED TO THAT TO

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:48.099
THEIR BUDGET. ON THE COURT SIDE-

00:27:48.166 --> 00:27:50.168
WHILE THERE WAS A TRIAL COURT

00:27:50.235 --> 00:27:51.703
REALIGNMENT- SHIFTING

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:53.538
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COURTS TO

00:27:53.605 --> 00:27:57.075
THE STATE- COURT EMPLOYEES OR

00:27:57.142 --> 00:27:58.109
COURT EMPLOYEES THERE AND

00:27:58.176 --> 00:28:00.678
THEY'RE NOT- WE DON'T THAT THE

00:28:00.745 --> 00:28:02.480
LEGISLATURE DOES NOT APPROVE

00:28:02.547 --> 00:28:04.516
ADULT ADULT USE IN THE SAME WAY

00:28:04.582 --> 00:28:07.419
AND SO- AS PART OF THE BUDGET

00:28:07.485 --> 00:28:09.554
SOMETIMES BUT DEPARTMENT FINANCE

00:28:09.621 --> 00:28:11.423
WILL PROVIDE AN UNALLOCATED

00:28:11.489 --> 00:28:13.691
AUGMENTATION- AND THEN SOMETIMES

00:28:13.758 --> 00:28:15.293
LIKE IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET THEY

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:16.928
WILL PROVIDE A SPECIFIC

00:28:16.995 --> 00:28:18.830
PERCENTAGE AMOUNTS AND SO THAT'S

00:28:18.897 --> 00:28:20.198
WHAT YOU SEE BEFORE YOU I DON'T

00:28:20.265 --> 00:28:21.299
KNOW IF THAT PROVIDE HELPFUL

00:28:21.366 --> 00:28:24.135
CONTEXT. WILL IT IT DOES IT

00:28:24.202 --> 00:28:24.869
RAISES THE QUESTION ARE YOU

00:28:24.936 --> 00:28:25.837
SAYING THAT THESE

00:28:25.904 --> 00:28:28.573
DISINFLATIONARY JUST MINUTES FOR

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:34.045
PERSONNEL COSTS. A PAYROLL

00:28:34.112 --> 00:28:37.582
BENEFITS- PERS OR I DON'T

00:28:37.649 --> 00:28:38.450

00:28:42.053 --> 00:28:44.889
BUT I MY OWN COUNTY- THE NEWS

00:28:44.956 --> 00:28:46.291

00:29:00.338 --> 00:29:01.773
INFLATIONARY PRESSURES. BEYOND

SOME FUTURE DATE DEGREE IT DID

00:40:50.181 --> 00:40:51.415
AT SOME POINT WHERE WE MAY NOT

00:40:51.482 --> 00:40:52.883
HAVE THE LUXURY OF A SURPLUS. BY

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:57.321

FUNDING IS JUST OVER 80% OF WHAT

00:41:19.643 --> 00:41:21.212
THE PROPOSED FUNDING OUR OUR-

00:41:21.278 --> 00:41:23.314
STATEWIDE AVERAGE WITH JUMP TO

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:25.916
EIGHTY EIGHT PERCENT- WHICH IS.

00:41:25.983 --> 00:41:29.220
A SIGNIFICANT. INCREASE AND WITH

00:41:29.286 --> 00:41:31.322
THAT I THINK THAT YOU CERTAINLY

00:41:31.388 --> 00:41:32.690

AFFECT THE JUDICIARY- THERE WILL

00:41:49.707 --> 00:41:51.442
LIKELY BE AN EROSION AT SOME

00:41:51.508 --> 00:41:54.278
POINT WHERE WE MAY NEED TO COME

00:41:54.345 --> 00:41:56.380
BACK TO YOU BUT I CAN SAY NOW

00:41:56.447 --> 00:41:59.984
THAT- AS PROPOSED. THIS MAKES A

00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:03.454
SIGNIFICANT- IMPROVEMENT TO THE

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:06.090
JUDICIARY- IN OUR CAPACITY TO

00:42:06.156 --> 00:42:08.792

00:42:11.095 --> 00:42:12.963
ROUGHLY. HOW MUCH TIME DOES IS

00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:15.266
BY YOU RIGHT I'M I'M TRYING TO

00:42:15.332 --> 00:42:16.066
GET A SENSE OF AS WE LOOK INTO

00:42:16.133 --> 00:42:18.802
THE FUTURE. AND WE SHOULD BE AS

00:42:18.869 --> 00:42:20.237
POLICY MAKERS THINK ABOUT A

00:42:20.304 --> 00:42:21.705
SMARTER. AND MORE ACCURATE WAY

00:42:21.772 --> 00:42:23.440
TO FIND THE JUSTICE SYSTEM YOU

00:42:23.507 --> 00:42:24.742

MINIMUM LIKE WE SHOULD BE

00:42:28.979 --> 00:42:34.718
THINKING ABOUT THE NEXT PHASE.

00:42:34.785 --> 00:42:35.786
TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN I WAS

00:42:35.853 --> 00:42:38.055
RESEARCHING A- ALL AT TO THAT IS

00:42:38.122 --> 00:42:39.089
A VERY. QUESTION IN THAT- I

00:42:39.156 --> 00:42:41.091
CAN'T FOR SEE WHAT THE

00:42:41.158 --> 00:42:42.893
INFLATIONARY FACTORS WILL BE IN

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:44.929
THE NEXT FEW YEARS I WOULD THINK

00:42:44.995 --> 00:42:46.563
THAT FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:48.599
THOUGH THAT- THAT SHOULD THINGS

00:42:48.666 --> 00:42:51.302
REMAIN STABLE THAT THE JUDICIARY

00:42:51.368 --> 00:42:53.971

IT'S CLEAR IF WE PURSUE SOME OF

00:43:08.452 --> 00:43:12.623
THE OTHER- DESIST SUBJECT AREAS

00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:13.757
WE TALKED ABOUT PARTICULARLY.

00:43:13.824 --> 00:43:16.160

00:43:37.481 --> 00:43:39.817

OFFICE AGAIN SH SO I THINK THE

01:56:46.566 --> 01:56:49.135
WE THINK THE OVERALL CONCEPT AS

01:56:49.202 --> 01:56:51.971
FOCUSING ON OFFICER WELLNESS HAS

01:56:52.038 --> 01:56:54.941
MERIT- OFFICER WELLNESS IS

01:56:55.007 --> 01:56:56.509
IMPORTANT AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

01:56:56.576 --> 01:56:57.643
OFFICERS TO BE ABLE TO

01:56:57.710 --> 01:56:59.479
EFFECTIVELY. ADMINISTER THEIR

01:56:59.545 --> 01:57:01.948
DUTIES AND DE ESCALATE DANGEROUS

01:57:02.014 --> 01:57:03.483
SITUATION SENSE OF THE OVERALL

01:57:03.549 --> 01:57:06.052
CONCEPT HAS NEAR H. AND HOWEVER

01:57:06.119 --> 01:57:08.221
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND THAT

01:57:08.287 --> 01:57:09.455
DOESN'T INCLUDE SOME OF THE

01:57:09.522 --> 01:57:11.591
DETAILS THAT WE WOULD AYE THAT

01:57:11.657 --> 01:57:13.926
TYPICALLY I LIKE TO SEE IT FOR A

01:57:13.993 --> 01:57:15.595
PROPOSAL THAT COULD REALLY

01:57:15.661 --> 01:57:17.029
DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE

01:57:17.096 --> 01:57:19.065
PROPOSED PROGRAM WOULD ACTUALLY

01:57:19.132 --> 01:57:21.534
IMPROVE OFFICER WELLNESS. AND IN

01:57:21.601 --> 01:57:22.935
PARTICULAR WE FIND THAT THERE'S

01:57:23.002 --> 01:57:24.771
A NUMBER OF UNANSWERED QUESTIONS

01:57:24.837 --> 01:57:27.106
REGARDING THE PROPOSAL. AND AS

01:57:27.173 --> 01:57:29.442
WAS MENTIONED THERE IS A VARIETY

01:57:29.509 --> 01:57:30.877
OF ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD BE

01:57:30.943 --> 01:57:32.578

WOULD BE ALLOCATED TO THE

01:57:36.649 --> 01:57:39.385
DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES- NEED

01:57:39.452 --> 01:57:40.987
SPECIFIC PRIMARY GOALS OF THE

01:57:41.053 --> 01:57:42.655
PROGRAM ARE NOT IDENTIFIED AS

01:57:42.722 --> 01:57:45.825
WAS ALLUDED TO THERE IS A HIGH

01:57:45.892 --> 01:57:47.193

ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND EVEN

01:57:55.268 --> 01:57:57.437
I'M IMPROVING I'M COMMUNITY

01:57:57.503 --> 01:57:59.138
WHILE LAST OUT WITH REGARDS TO

01:57:59.205 --> 01:58:01.340
LAW ENFORCEMENT- AND WHILE ALL

01:58:01.407 --> 01:58:04.510
OF THOSE ARE IMPORTANT. AND THAT

01:58:04.577 --> 01:58:06.813
WITHOUT A SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT

01:58:06.879 --> 01:58:11.350
OF. WHAT GOALS WOULD BE TARGETED

01:58:11.417 --> 01:58:13.019
WITH THE SCIENCES DIFFICULT FOR

01:58:13.085 --> 01:58:15.221
THE LEGISLATURE TO EVALUATE THE

01:58:15.288 --> 01:58:17.490
MERITS OF THE PROGRAM- IN

01:58:17.557 --> 01:58:19.292
ADDITION WE FIND THAT

01:58:19.358 --> 01:58:20.193
ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT ANSWERED

01:58:20.259 --> 01:58:21.828
THE QUESTION- SPECIFICALLY IN

01:58:21.894 --> 01:58:23.596
TERMS OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WOULD

01:58:23.663 --> 01:58:27.133
BE SOLVED. WITH THESE FINE SIDE

01:58:27.200 --> 01:58:28.768
THERE HAS NOT BEEN AN ASSESSMENT

01:58:28.835 --> 01:58:32.071
OF SPECIFIC GAPS OR WEAKNESSES

01:58:32.138 --> 01:58:34.340
IN EXISTING LINE FIRST MEANT

01:58:34.407 --> 01:58:36.442
WELLNESS PROGRAMS- AND WHAT

01:58:36.509 --> 01:58:45.918
SHOULD BE IMPORTANT. FOR THE

01:58:45.985 --> 01:58:46.986
LEGISLATURE TO NOW IN TERMS OF

01:58:47.053 --> 01:58:48.521
HOW THESE WERE ACT. MAYBE

01:58:48.588 --> 01:58:49.422
ALLOCATED TO SPECIFIC ACTIVE AND

01:58:49.489 --> 01:58:50.990
WHETHER THE DUST ACT- OR THE

01:58:51.057 --> 01:58:53.759
MOST AFFECT ONES CHU I THE- AND

01:58:53.826 --> 01:58:58.764
- RIGHT- AGAIN I ALSO DOES NOT

01:58:58.831 --> 01:58:59.899
IDENTIFY THIS ACTIVITIES THAT

01:58:59.966 --> 01:59:00.967
WOULD BE FUNDED AND WE CAN

01:59:01.033 --> 01:59:02.602
SUPPORT FOR THE LEAD. TO KNOW

01:59:02.668 --> 01:59:04.837
APPROVING ANY FOR I AND ITS

01:59:04.904 --> 01:59:07.540
BANKS WHAT WOULD BE EXPECTED

01:59:07.607 --> 01:59:10.476
WITH THE SPARTANS I'M SUCH AS A

01:59:10.543 --> 01:59:12.078
MEASURABLE METRICS ON

01:59:12.144 --> 01:59:13.880
IMPROVEMENT IN OFFICER WELLNESS

01:59:13.946 --> 01:59:15.781
OR EVEN THE NUMBER OF OFFICERS

01:59:15.848 --> 01:59:17.416
THAT WOULD BE SERVICE THROUGH

01:59:17.483 --> 01:59:20.386
THESE PROGRAMS- I THINK IT'S

01:59:20.453 --> 01:59:21.921
IMPORTANT TO KNOW HOW THE

01:59:21.988 --> 01:59:23.556
ADMINISTRATION HAS INDICATED

01:59:23.623 --> 01:59:26.259
THAT- WELL THE PROPOSAL DOESN'T

01:59:26.325 --> 01:59:28.528
SAY IT'S LIKELY THAT POST WHICH

01:59:28.594 --> 01:59:30.530
USED TO PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT

01:59:30.596 --> 01:59:32.498
AMOUNT OF THE SPENDING INTO THE

01:59:32.565 --> 01:59:34.734
OFFICER WELLNESS WORKSHOPS THAT

01:59:34.800 --> 01:59:37.436
IT PLANS TO DEMOLISH. I OUR

01:59:37.503 --> 01:59:39.238
OFFICE IS BEEN TOLD THAT I HAD

01:59:39.305 --> 01:59:41.007
THIS LEVEL OF FUNDING COULD

01:59:41.073 --> 01:59:43.342
SUPPORT ROUGHLY THIRTY FIVE OF

01:59:43.409 --> 01:59:45.444
THESE OFFICER WELLNESS WORKSHOPS

01:59:45.511 --> 01:59:47.113
AT THIRTY FIVE ONE PERSON

01:59:47.179 --> 01:59:50.583
AGENCIES WITH OVER SIX HUNDRED A

01:59:50.650 --> 01:59:51.717
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN THE

01:59:51.784 --> 01:59:54.487
STATE- UNDERSTANDING THOSE

01:59:54.554 --> 01:59:56.122
OUTCOMES AND HOW FUNDS WILL BE

01:59:56.188 --> 01:59:58.157
ALLOCATED IS IMPORTANT SINCE

01:59:58.224 --> 01:59:59.792
OBVIOUSLY THIS WOULD NOT PROVIDE

01:59:59.859 --> 02:00:01.727
ENOUGH FUNDING FOR THIRTY FIVE

02:00:01.794 --> 02:00:04.463
WORKSHOPS TO COVER ALL SIX

02:00:04.530 --> 02:00:05.064
HUNDRED. LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:00:05.131 --> 02:00:08.200
AGENCIES IN THE STATE- AND TO

02:00:08.267 --> 02:00:09.635
THE EXTENT HOUSE HAS A PLAN TO

02:00:09.702 --> 02:00:10.970
DO THAT UNDERSTANDING THE

02:00:11.037 --> 02:00:12.638
DETAILS OF THAT WOULD BE

02:00:12.705 --> 02:00:14.507
IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

02:00:14.574 --> 02:00:16.242
GET A SENSE AS TO HOW MANY

02:00:16.309 --> 02:00:18.044
OFFICERS WOULD BE SERVED THROUGH

02:00:18.110 --> 02:00:26.319

02:00:26.385 --> 02:00:28.487
THIS. THIS PER WE HAVE BEEN THAT

02:00:28.554 --> 02:00:30.489
COSTA IT WILL TAKE ROUGHLY A- TO

02:00:30.556 --> 02:00:32.491
DEVOUR THE- OF THIS CAR. AND PER

02:00:32.558 --> 02:00:33.960
I HAD TO TAPES OF THE THAT WE

02:00:34.026 --> 02:00:36.762
THINK LEGISLATURE I WOULD WANT

02:00:36.829 --> 02:00:38.030
TO KNOW BEFORE APPROVING

02:00:38.097 --> 02:00:41.033
SPENDING- AND IF. IF IT WOULD

02:00:41.100 --> 02:00:43.169
TAKE THAT LONG TO DEVELOP THE

02:00:43.235 --> 02:00:44.837
PROGRAM SHE DOES RAISE A

02:00:44.904 --> 02:00:47.707
QUESTION ABOUT TO WHAT EXTENT

02:00:47.773 --> 02:00:49.308
SHOULD HAVE HOST COULD HANDLE

02:00:49.375 --> 02:00:51.444
DEVELOPING THIS NEW PROGRAM AT

02:00:51.510 --> 02:00:52.612
THE SAME TIME THAT THEY ARE

02:00:52.678 --> 02:00:54.513
ROLLING OUT THE VERY SIGNIFICANT

02:00:54.580 --> 02:00:57.817
EFFORTS TO. IMPLEMENT SB TO

02:00:57.883 --> 02:00:59.819
WHICH AS WHAT IS SPOKEN TO

02:00:59.885 --> 02:01:01.654
EARLIER OR MIGHT IT MINISTRATION

02:01:01.721 --> 02:01:03.656
IS REQUIRING REDIRECTING SOME OF

02:01:03.723 --> 02:01:05.958
THE EXISTING STOCK OF OTHER AN
