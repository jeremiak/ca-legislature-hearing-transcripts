THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND SPECIAL THINGS FOR THE INCREDIBLE WORK YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF DID TO HELP US WITH THE BILL AND THE AMENDMENTS. I WILL TAKE ALL OF THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS. AB FIVE SEVENTY OFFERS A CRITICAL OPPORTUNITY TO BRIDGE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN RURAL AND URBAN CALIFORNIA. BY REFORMING THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCED SERVICES FUND PROGRAM. AND EXTENDING AND ADJUSTING AN EXISTING FUNDING STREAM. AS WE'VE ALL OF UNFORTUNATELY SEEN THE ON GOING PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS HAS MADE IT PAINFULLY CLEAR TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD THE WE HAVE WHAT WE HAVE KNOWN FOR YEARS. OUR WORK TO DIGITALLY CONNECT ALL CALIFORNIANS IS VIRTUALLY IMPORTANT NOW MORE THAN EVER. AB FIVE SEVENTY PRIORITIZE THE DEPLOYMENT OF BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE. UNSERVED AND UNDERSERVED. RURAL AND URBAN AREAS WELL OPENING THE DOOR FOR A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND TRIED TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS TO PROVIDE CONNECTIVITY IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES. MY PROPOSAL OFFERS A RESPONSIBLE PATHWAY TO RELIABLE FUTURE PROOF BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY FOR THE ONE IN EIGHT CALIFORNIA HOME TO STILL DO NOT HAVE INTERNET ACCESS AND THE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHO FACE EVEN HIGHER NUMBERS OF STUDENTS AND FAMILIES REMAIN DISCONNECTED. AB FIVE SEVENTY REJECTS THE STATUS QUO THAT IS A FAR TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS AND THEIR FAMILIES THE BOTH RURAL AND URBAN PARTS OF OUR STATE WITHOUT INTERNET ACCESS. NECESSARY TO CONNECT TO GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT. ONE IS THE LIFESAVING TECHNOLOGY FOR TELEMEDICINE DEMOCRATIZE THE DISTANCE LEARNING. ENABLE PRECISION AGRICULTURE AND SUSTAIN SMALL BUSINESSES OVER HALF OF WHOM WORK FROM HOME. MY BILL ENSURES GRANTS ADMINISTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION ARE AWARDED TO APPLICANTS WHO ARE WILLING AND ABLE TO QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY CONNECT HOUSEHOLDS. COMMUNITY ANCHOR INSTITUTIONS SMALL BUSINESSES AND EMPLOYERS BY BUILDING FIBER MIDDLE MILE THAT WILL PROVIDE HIGHER SPEEDS AND ACCESS TO CONNECTIVITY TO ALL THOSE WHO ARE UNSERVED ALONG THE PATHWAY OF DEPLOYMENT. WITH THE REQUIREMENT OF FIBER MIDDLE MILE THOSE PROJECTS WILL PROVIDE TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL ADAPT TO HIGHER SPEEDS BEYOND THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OF TWENTY FIVE THREE IN AB FIVE SEVENTY AND EVOLVING TECHNOLOGY. DO NOT SENATORS ALLOW OTHERS TO MISCAST THE ISSUE OF ELIGIBILITY FOR UNSERVED AND UNDERSERVED HOUSEHOLDS WITH THE GOAL FOR TECHNOLOGY WE WANT PROJECTS TO PROVIDE IN THE PROGRAM. BY AMENDING THE DE OF UNSERVED TWENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE WE HAVE MADE MORE THAN HALF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM. WITHOUT EXTENDING FUNDING. LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN WITHOUT EXTENDING FUNDINGTO MATCH A PORTION OF THAT NEED WITH THE AMENDMENTS I ACCEPT TODAY. NEITHER URBAN OR RURAL CONSTITUENTS FORGET WHAT THIS COMMITTEE APPROVED EARLIER THIS YEAR. AND RURAL COMMUNITIES WILL BE LAST. AB FIVE SEVENTY HOLDS INCUMBENT PROVIDERS ACCOUNTABLE BY ALLOWING THE CPUC TOWARD GRANTS TO THOSE ARE WHO ARE WILLING AND ALE TO BUILD OUT BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE OR EXISTING PROVIDERS HAVE FAILED TO DO SO. RELIABLE INTERNET CONNECTIVITY WILL REMAIN AN OVER DO NECESSITY LONG AFTERTHIS PANDEMIC HAS SUBSIDED AND THIS PIVOTAL MOMENT IN OUR GLOBAL HISTORY OFFERS US A TRUE OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD BY INVESTING IN THE FUTURE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. AND CHOOSING TO PRIORITIZE OF THOSE WE HAVE BEEN LEFT IN THE DARK. WE WILL NOT LEAVE ANYONE BEHIND IN CALIFORNIA MUST EMBRACE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO LEVERAGE FEDERAL FUNDS IN COORDINATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCED SERVICES FUND. DOLLARS BY INVESTING IN OPEN ACCESS FIBER MIDDLE MILE CONNECTIVITY FOR ALL. OUR COLLEAGUE SENATOR GONZALEZ IS OFFERING SB ELEVEN THIRTY. A PROPOSAL THAT OFFERS NO ADDITIONAL FUNDING WHILE INCREASING ELIGIBILITY FOR CALIFORNIA ADVANCED SERVICES FUND GRANTS. WITHOUT A COMPLIMENTARY EFFORT TO ADOPT A FUNDING COMPONENT THE LEGITIMATE INTERESTS OF OUR COLLEAGUE RAISES FOR INCREASED SPEEDS ENSURING URBAN CONNECTIVITY DOES THERE'S OFFER EMPTY ELIGIBILITY. I HAVE OFFERED COLLABORATION A MEETING EACH OF OUR GOALS AND I BELIEVE WE ARE BOTH IN BOTH COMMITTED TO COLLABORATING TO REACH OUR MUTUAL GOAL. SB FIVE SEVENTY IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR STATE'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND PROVIDES A MEASURED AND MEANINGFUL PATHWAY TO ACHIEVE A BRIGHTER FUTURE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. WITH YOUR SUPPORT. WE CAN BRIDGE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE BETWEEN THOSE WITH INTERNET CONNECTIVITY AND THOSE WHO DEPEND ON FAST AND RELIABLE INTERNET ACCESS AS A NORMAL PART OF THE DAILY LIVES. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR BIBLE.

YES WHAT IS YOUR NAME BUT INTERESTED BUCKLE AND THEN I GOING PROCEED HONEST HERE. YES PLEASE PROCEED. OKAY THANK YOU HI MISTER SHARON AND MEMBERS MY NAME'S ARE AT THE TOP OWN I'M THE SENIOR LET'S SAY COUNSEL FOR THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION I A I BRING WITH ME FIFTEEN YEARS OF TELECOMMUNICATION POLICY EXPERIENCE INCLUDING SERVING ON THE FEDERAL LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE TO DRAFT OF THE FIRST BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM A FELLOWSHIP IT'LL FIBER FELLOWSHIP WITH GOVERNOR BROWN ALL THE PLANNING AND RESEARCH TO DEVELOP THE STATE'S FIRST TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICIES FOR THE GENERAL PLAN GUIDELINE. EFF IN MAJORITY THE OPPOSITION THIS BILL SPACING IT IS NOT BECAUSE IT FUND'S. PROFIT INFRASTRUCTURE WE SUPPORT THAT. IT'S BILL WAS TO PROVIDE A SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON THE PURE ACT POPULAR WE WOULD SUPPORT THAT TO. OUR CONCERN IS THAT HIGH OF INFRASTRUCTURE THIS BILL IS SEEKING TO FINANCIAL STATE MONEY. WITH A NEW PRIORITY COST EFFECTIVE TWENTY FIGHT THE METRIC THIS METRIC WILL NOT PUSH FIBER OPTICS INTO ON SIR COMMUNITIES. FIBER BEING THE COURT INFRASTRUCTURE BUT LITERALLY% ALL MODERN NETWORK TODAY ARE USING TO ENABLE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY ACCESS. AND THAT'S BECAUSE FIBER IS NOT A TWENTY FOUR YOU CONNECTION IT IS A TRANSFORMATIVE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT PROVIDE HIGH CAPACITY ACCESS. A PRIOR TWENTY FIVE THREE COST EFFECTIVE STANDARD ESSENTIALLY REPRESENTS TWO TYPES OF NETWORK DEPLOYMENT. THE FIRST IS UPGRADING COPPER LINES FROM THE OLD TELEPHONE SYSTEM CALLED DSL. DOES KIND ASSISTANCE AND THEY ARE BEING ABANDONED BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR TODAY IN FAVOR OF FIBER OPTICS IN A SCENE VETERAN AND UPGRADING THOSE NETWORKS. WHICH WOULD BE A COMPLETE AND TOTAL WASTE THE- IS OPERATING CELLPHONE. BY CONNECTING WITH FIBER AND AS TO THIRTY MILES OUTSIDE OF THESE COMMUNITIES. WHICH IS ALREADY MANDATED UNDER TEAM MOBILE'S MURDER- CONDITIONS WITH SPRINT. WHICH MEANS PRIVATE DOLLARS WITHOUT GOVERNMENT SUPPORT OR BUILDING OUT THIS NETWORK IN THE FEDERAL LAW. PUSHING FIBER ENTITIES COMMUNITIES SHOULD BE THE PARTY OF ANY GOVERNMENT INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM AND EVERY DOLLAR SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON BUILDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT WE NEED TO END THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. THE BEST WAY FOR ME TO HELP EXPLAIN KIND OF THE CONSEQUENCE OF DIFFERENT TO THESE APPROACHES. IS THE POINT TO THE STORY ABOUT OF THE TINY TOWN OF DILLON BEACH CALIFORNIA. THEIR FATHER CHILD NEED INTERNET MUCH LIKE ANY REAL COMMUNITY IN ORDER TO OUR SCHOOL WORK. HE DECIDED THAT HE WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO IS GET A FIBRE LINE CONNECTED TO HIS GARAGE FROM A CELL TOWER OF EIGHTEEN HE OWNED. A TOWER THAT WAS A FRACTION AWAY FROM HOME. FOR TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO CONNECTED IT HOUSE AND THEN REALIZE THAT SINGLE FIBER LINE ONE LINE. GIVE THEM SO MUCH BANDWIDTH. BUT HE WAS ABLE TO START A GARAGE BASED ICE T. FOR COMMUNITY HAD NO INTERNET. WITH OFF THE SHELF HARDWARE. THAT WAS THREE YEARS AGO AND TODAY IN THAT. COUNTY BEFORE TO PEOPLE. PEOPLE HAVE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MEGABIT DOWNLOAD ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MEGABIT UPLOAD WIRELESS BROADBAND. OR FIFTY DOLLARS A MONTH. GET A TRAVEL. MILES OUT TO DRAW THAT FIBER AND AB FIVE SEVENTY LEAD OUT ITS INFRASTRUCTURE POLICY. IT COSTS WOULD EXCEED A MILLION DOLLARS MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE SERVICE COMMUNITY. THIS BILL IS RENDON NOT MAKE A DOWN PAYMENT TOWARDS THE FUTURE THAT WE NEED. IT DIVERTS FROM AN UNNECESSARILY AND IT FEELS NONE OF THE PROPOSED BENEFIT THAT ARE BEING ASSERTIVE ARTICLES. I KNOW SOME SUPPORTING THAT LEGISLATION ARE WILL ARGUE THAT THE NUMBERS DON'T MEAN ANYTHING BUT THAT THAT IS CATEGORICALLY WRONG. THE NUMBERS IN THE BILL DICTATE YOUR EXPECT YOUR POLICY. AND THE STATE AGES ARE VIEWING THIS EFFORT MUCH LIKE WE DO THE ROADS. ARE CONNECTING POUNDS OF THE ROAD ENABLE COMMERCE AND SELF SUFFICIENCY. AND EVERY DOLLAR SHOULD BE DIRECTED TOWARDS BUILDING THE. ROAD AND THAT ROAD TODAY IS FIBER. SHOULD SB FIVE. TO AROUND PUSH JUST EVEN A- PIPELINE TO. RULE UNSERVED TOWN WITH ZERO AXIS WE WOULD SUPPORT IT AND PUT MANY WHO OPPOSE THE UNLIMITED RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE A MASSIVE STEP TOWARD.ALL COME RESOLUTIONS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. WE HAVE WORKED IN PLACE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR HAND FOR NOW WE ARE POSTING ONCE AMENDED. WE WANT TO SUPPORT THIS BILL WE WANT TO SUPPORT AT ELEVEN THIRTY BOTH OF THESE CAN BE DONE TOGETHER- BUT A AND B. FOCUS ON CONNECTING THE ANSWER TO THE FUTURE. THANK YOU.

RAISED YES. PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I THANK YOU SIMPLY MEMBER FOR. DAHLE YOUR WORK NOT JUST THIS YEAR BUT OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS TRYING TO CONQUER THIS DIGITAL DIVIDE I I'M JUST I'M WONDERING IF YOU COULD COMMENT ON- THIS QUESTION WAS RAISED ABOUT THE- TWENTY FIVE THREE SPLIT BEING INADEQUATE AND- I KNOW IT'S A BIG DEAL. OUT IN YOUR NECK OF THE WOODS IN RURAL AREAS AND WE HAVE IT IN BOTH RURAL AND URBAN AREAS AND- WITH PEOPLE ALSO TRYING TO. CALL IN FOR SCHOOL NOW AND ALL THE TELECOMMUTING THAT HAS TO HAPPEN BUT ESPECIALLY FOR. PHARMACY SB A PERSPECTIVE I'M JUST CURIOUS- HOW WE DEAL WITH. IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE YOU'RE IN A SPOT WHERE YOU'RE TRYING TO DO WHAT'S- FEASIBLE IN THE NEAR TERM BUT MAYBE NOT ASPIRATIONAL ENOUGH TO REALLY CLOSE THAT DIVIDES SO- YOU MIGHT RISING COMMENTS ARE YOU OR YOUR YOUR SPONSORS ESPECIALLY WITH THE SCHOOL BOARD'S FOLKS. SURE I'LL LET MY SPONSOR- IS USING MY SPEAKER EITHER TRISH FOR DISTURBANCE SPEAK BEFORE THEY DO THAT IS THAT. COMING UP WITH THE SPEED IS NOT ME IS NOT THE TO TIRE FOLK THIS. WE TO RE IS THAT IT REALLY HAVE LOT TO DO WITH THE FUNDING. IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY YOU CAN'T. BILLS AND SO. IT'S ALREADY IN. FOR FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ON MILLION DOLLARS THE PEOPLE OF APPLIED TO MOVE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS ALONG BUT THE FUND ONLY HAS LIKE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY WILL NEVER WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SO IT'S NOT GOING TO GET EVERYBODY COVERED. AND I ALWAYS LOOK AT THESE THINGS IS THAT- WE NEED TO LOOK AT- GIVING THE BEST AND I THINK FARMERS A WAY TO DO THAT IT'S GOING TO HELP US TO THE FUTURE- OF RIGHT NOW I WON SAID TWENTY FIVE THREE GREAT- BUT WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE ANY SERVICE AT ALL RIGHT NOW THE IMPORTANT TO THIS BILL IS TO MAKE SURE WE GET PEOPLE THAT ARE. NOT SERVED GET THEM SERVE AND I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE ANYONE BEHIND SO THAT'S WHAT WE I'M GOING WITH THIS IS THAT ITS IMPORTANCE IS THE SPEED IMPORTANT ABSOLUTELY- BUT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER IS THAT. BELIEVE SOMEBODY BUT- IT EVERYBODY GETS A LOT OF A BAND WITH WE'RE GONNA LEAVE SOME OF. THE MOST OF THE RURAL AREAS IN EVEN URBAN AREAS BEHIND. SO ALL THE- MISS A- KELLY- GONZALEZ REPEAT ISN'T AS WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLYMEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY. THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THAT THE REASON CALIFORNIA ADVANCED SERVICES FUND PROJECTS APPROVED BY THE P. YOU SEE. I HAVE ALL ALMOST ALL BEEN FIRED WITH PROJECT SO WITH THAT IT'S RATHER A MOOT POINT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE THAT'S. THE PROJECT THAT WE'RE WORKING ON IN THE REGION TO GET BY THE- ENABLING BOB HERTZBERG MIDDLE MILE. PER IT'S ALSO GOING TO HELP THE DRAWING EACH REACH THE GOAL WE ARE. VERY PACKED ABOUT TRYING TO OUR COVER IN OUR MANY MANY UNSERVED AND UNDERSERVED AREAS BUT ALSO WE ARE ASPIRATIONAL WE WANT THE BEST FOR OUR COMMUNITY AND WE'RE TRYING TO PROMOTE. NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT ELLA TO BREAK THE ISSUE SELECT COMMITTEE SO. I THINK IT'S OUR IT'S OUR- MISSTATED TO SAY THAT THE BILL BRING. BACK IT BRING THAT FORWARD. AND IT PROVIDES THE FUNDING RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT SO. THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE BEING DEPLOYED NOW ARE. ALMOST BY THE GREAT THE PROJECT THAT THE CATHOLIC THE FUNDING. THANK YOU. OKAY VERY SERVICE CENTERS. ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT YEAH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANKS FOR THAT THE- RESPONSE I GUESS MY STRUGGLE WITH WITH THE LEGISLATION IS THAT I LOVE THE FUNDING PORTION AND I THINK YOU GUYS HAVE DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB OF BUILDING A FRAMEWORK THAT ERROR I JUST. TAKE A MINUTE NAP IS THERE ANY OPENNESS TO GOING BEYOND THE TWENTY FIVE THREE AND HAVING SOMETHING MORE ASPIRATIONAL PERHAPS IN LINE WITH WHAT WE PASSED THROUGH THE SENATE- ANY OF VERSION TO TRYING TO SORT OF HAVE. GREEN WITH ALL YOUR PURPOSES HERE JUST CURIOUS AND- I'LL SEE MY REMARKS AFTER THAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OKAY VERY WELL. THE ASPIRATIONS IS TO GET AS FAST AS WE CAN WE'RE NOT. DOING NOW SAW OUT OF OUR HOUSE- THE FACT THE MATTER IS IT TWENTY FIVE THREE IS REASONABLE TO FEDERAL STANDARDS. WE CAN GO FROM MORE THAN THAT BUT WE NEED TO BE A REALISTIC AS YOU MOVE FORWARD. MY GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE FASTER SPEEDS. FOR FAMILIES CAN. USE THE INTERNET AT HOME OR TELL HEALTH OR WHATEVER BUT WE DO NEED TO HAVE A FASTER. OUR OLD SPEEDS WERE JUST TOO SLOW. BUT STILL DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING TO MY DISTRICT THEY THEY'RE STILL UNDERSERVED OR NOT SERVED. BUT VERY AND OTHER MY OF THE THAT'S OSCAR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANTED TO- THANK YOU AND THE COMMITTEE-STAFF FOR THE WORK ON THE BILL BECAUSE I THINK THE AMENDMENTS TO IMPROVE IT. AND I GUESS I WOULD. ASK AGAIN I- AS MY COLLEAGUE- SENATOR STERN- I. ARE TOTALLY APPRECIATE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER THE. AND APPRECIATE ANY. THAT WE HAVE SO MANY AREAS IT THAT- JUST DON'T EVEN HAVE SERVICE SO THE FEDERAL SPEED AT WAY YOU KNOW WHAT OF COURSE. THAT'S OF COURSE WHAT WE WANT AT MINIMUM BUT GIVEN THAT HE ASKED ABOUT THE ASPIRATIONAL GOAL MAN I THINK THAT IF WE ARE GOING TO BE. INVESTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE THE GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCE FOR FACING NOW AND GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT KIDS NEEDS FOR. ONLINE LEARNING IN THE REST THAT. WE SHOULD BE DOING OUR VERY BEST TO GET THAT HIGH SPEED AND SO AGAIN I WANT TO ASK ABOUT THAT OPENNESS BECAUSE THERE'RE- BEEN THROUGH WAS VERY CHANGES TO THE BILL BUT THERE POTENTIALLY.

OF THAT IS. HE BOBBI IS PRESENT I COULD JUST INTERRUPT YOU HE BEGAN IS PRETTY PRESENTATION ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT A LOT OF BY MY COMMENTS- MORE CONCERNED PRIMARILY. WAS ACTING BILL AS DRAFTED. WOULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY COMING FROM RIGHT THERE'S A LITTLE ACCOUNTABILITY AT A TIME WHEN REALLY RATE CARES CAN'T AFFORD IT- ARE CONCERNED THAT THERE THAT THERE WERE PENDING PROCEEDINGS THAT NEEDED TO BE DEALT WITHOUT THE CPUC AND NOT. OVERRIDE THAT PROCESS TO DICTATE THE OUTCOME IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY THESE AMENDMENTS WOULD. REMOVE THOSE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL WHICH THOSE OF BILL THAT COULD IN FACT CHANGE THE POSITION OF TAR SO I WILL LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THOSE AMENDMENTS IN PRINT- BUT WE WOULD SAY THAT IF IT DOES NOT CHANGE THAT OR WE FEEL FOR K. WE WANT. ENSURE THAT WE PART THE COMMISSION PROCESS. SO THAT ALL STAKEHOLDERS CAN PARTICIPATE IN THEIR OUTCOMES THAT'LL DETERMINE YOUR COLLABORATIVE PROCESS AS OPPOSED TO THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. OUR CONCERN IS THAT IN THEFUTURE IF THERE ARE HEAVILY DEBATED. ITEMS THAT THE COMMISSION WE WOULD NOT WANT SOMEONE COMING TO THE LEGISLATURE TO OVERRIDE THE COMMISSION- WHEN SOMETHING IS IN THE PROCESS. AND EVEN AS THE BILL AS DRAFTED THERE IS AN APPLICATION THAT WOULD BE APPROVED. BEFORE HIT IT HAS EVEN BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE COMMISSION SO WE WILL LOOK AT THOSE AMENDMENTS VERY CLOSELY WE DO APPRECIATE AND LIKE THE AMENDMENTS SUGGESTED. BY THE CANADIAN DOLLAR SYSTEM BY THE COMMITTEE SO WE DO APPRECIATE THAT MISTER CHAIR I WILL LOOK FORWARD TO LOOKING AT THOSE AMENDMENTS WHILE THEY'RE- AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION BASED ON THE- AND TO BE FAIR TO YOU. SIR I'D LIKE TO READ THE AMENDMENT OTHER THERE QUITE MOUTHFUL. BUT IF IT'S OKAY WITH YOU I'M GONNA READ THEM. AND THIS WOULD BE FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL THE SPEAKERS AT WILL BE SPEAKING IN OPPOSITION TO THE MEASURE.

MAYBE ANOTHER MINUTE FOR YOU TO COMMENT ON WHAT I'M ABOUT TO READ IT MIGHT NOT BE ENOUGH. FOR YOU TO FULLY UNDERSTAND BUT YOU MIGHT- SO I JUST WANT TO READ THEM TO YOU. BECAUSE THESE ARE ARE. THESE AMENDMENTS WERE- WERE PREPARED OVER THE WEEKEND AND I KNOW THIS PROCESS IS VERY DIFFICULT. AND HARD FOR PEOPLE TO- WAY AND UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES BUT- I WILL READ THE AMENDMENTS NOW THE FIRST AMENDMENT. TO DRESS THE SPEED OF RESOLVING THE PENDING APPLICATIONS. THIS BILL TO REQUIRE THE CPUC. THERESA THE TO PAY APPLICATIONS BY THE DATE PROPOSED IN THIS BILL MARCH FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND AFFORD THE CPU SO. THE ABILITY TO PROVE MODIFY TONIGHT THE APPLICATION. THE SECOND AMENDMENT. IS IN WHICH IS BILL FOR ST REFERENCE IN THE FUTURE. NOT FILED. APPLICATION AND IT- IN PARENTHESES PGA ANY APPLICATION. THE THIRD AMENDMENT IS TO ENSURE ADEQUATE TRACKING OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH TV CHARGING APPLICATIONS. NUMBER ONE DIRECT THE CPC TO REQUIRE SUFFICIENT TRACKING AND REPORTING OF TOTAL COSTS TO RATEPAYERS. AND TO ALLOW THE CPU CEDAR JUSTICE POLICY WITHOUT THE NEED. FOR LEGISLATIVE ACTION. ONLY AFTER THE UTILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THIS POLICY WITHIN A GENERAL RATE CASE CYCLE. NUMBER FOUR AMENDMENT IS DELETE LANGUAGE REQUIRING THE CVC TWO PROGRAMS IN THE ABSENCE OF PROGRAMMER GALATIANS OUR GUIDELINES AND INSTEAD. REQUIRE THE CVC TO PROVE GRANTS UPON ADOPTION OF PROGRAM REGULATIONS AND GUIDELINES. THE FIFTH AMENDMENT AMENDMENT NUMBER FIVE REQUIRE THE CVC TO NOTIFY APPROPRIATE STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE. THAT A DIVERSE GROUP OF QUALIFIED CRIME CONTRACTORS ARE AWARE OF FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES AMENDMENT NUMBER SIX CLARIFY THAT FUNDING ALLOCATIONS FOR THIS BILL ONLY APPLIED TO ENERGY INFILL. I'LL REPEAT CLARIFY THAT FUNDING ALLOCATIONS FOR THIS BILL ONLY APPLY TO ENERGY EFFICIENCY INCENTIVES FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY THREE PROGRAM YEARS AND AUTHORIZES CVC TO SET APPLICATION IN INCOME BIRDS DEADLINES TO ENSURE THAT ALL WORK INITIATE UNDER UNDER THE PROGRAM WILL BE COMPLETED BY APRIL FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SO I WILL GO BACK.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND YOUR PARTICIPATION TODAY WILL MOVE NOW TO COREY BOLAS WITH THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE COALITION ASSOCIATION IS A MISTER BULLISH ON THE LINE. WELL HE'S HERE IN THE CALORIE OKAY MISTER BLISS WELCOME. YOU MAY PROCEED WITH YOUR COMMENTS. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CORBELS ON BEHALF OF ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING ASSOCIATION WHICH IS COMPRISED OF TWELVE COMPANIES IN THE EEVEE CHARGING INDUSTRY. WE ARE REGRETFULLY OPPOSED TO AB EIGHT FOUR ONE BECAUSE OF THE E. D. I. T. P. CERTIFICATION MANDATE AS IT AS IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SLOW CHARGING STATION DEPLOYMENT WITHOUT PROVIDING A CLEAR SAFETY BENEFITS. WE DON'T TAKETHIS OPPOSITION LIGHTLY AS WE RECOGNIZE MISTER TING AS A LEADER IN CLEAN ENERGY POLICY. HOWEVER REQUIRING EVEY A. T. P. CERTIFICATION- TO ACCESS THESE CHARGING STATION INCENTIVES DOESN'T PROVIDE A SAFETY BENEFIT ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT THE STATE. AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE ALREADY REQUIRING. THE PC AND THE C. E. C. OR D. REQUIRE- PEOPLE TO HAVE A SEAT TEN- ELECTRICIANS LICENSE. WHICH IS RIGOROUS TO OBTAIN AN RECALL AND ENTAILS THOUSANDS OF HOURS OF. ON THE JOB EXPERIENCE THESE LICENSES TOGETHER WITH PRODUCT CERTIFICATION AND LOCAL BUILDING CODE REQUIREMENTS OR MORE THAN SUFFICIENT TO ENSURE ELECTRIC SHINS OR INSTALLING EVEN CHARGING STATIONS SAY FOR YOU AND TO RESPOND TO ONE OF THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE SUPPORTERS OF THIS LEGISLATION. WHILE THE PC DOES HAVE THIS AS PART OF ITS SAFETY CHECKLIST IT HAS NOT MANDATED THIS AS PART OF. ALL EVEY CHARGING STATION PROJECTS FOR APPLICATIONS AND EVEN IN ONE CASE DECIDED TO DECLINE ADOPTING THIS REQUIREMENT FOR ONE OF THE TV CHARGING STATION PROJECTS. HAS WRITTEN THIS PROVISION WOULD CUT OUT VIABLE CHARGING PROJECTS AND IN THE SHORT TERM RESTRICT THE LABOR POOL AND DRIVE UP COSTS AS THE INDUSTRY GRAPPLES WITH RECESSION. FURTHERMORE THIS GIVES YOU THE I. T. P. MONOPOLY ON TRAINING CURRICULUM. AT FOR CHARGING INSTALLATION WITH NO OVERSIGHT FROM THE STATE ON CURRICULUM COSTS FOR THE ABILITY TO ENSURE THERE'S ENOUGH TRAINING INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE. FOR AN INFLUX OF WHAT WILL BE THOUSANDS OF ELECTRICIANS LOOKING TO GET THE CERTIFICATION. CALIFORNIA ONLY HAS FORTY CERTIFIED TRAINERS CURRENTLY LOCATED MOSTLY IN COASTAL URBAN AREAS AND AS LATE AS LAST YEAR WITH NINE NORTH OF SACRAMENTO. AS RECOMMENDED BY THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS GIVEN THAT THE PC AND THE CDC OR ALREADY IN THE PROCESS PROCESS OF CONSIDERING REQUIRING THE V. I. T. P. THOSE PROCESS HE SHOULD PLAY OUT WERE EVEY ATP CAN BE VETTED MORE THOROUGHLY. THANK YOU. VERY WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW WILL MOVE TO SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AGAIN I WANT TO STRESS THE SAME POINT THAT WE HAVE IN MISTER TING HERE WITH AS THE AUTHOR OF THIS MEASURE THIS IS PART OF A LARGER ARCHITECTURE OF DISCUSSION. TO GET PEOPLE BACK TO WORK. FOR THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY PLAN THAT THE BILL BE YOU'LL STILL SEE SOME FURTHER AMENDMENTS I WOULD SUSPECT IS IN ALL OF THESE MEASURES. AS THE PACKAGES COME TOGETHER. BETWEEN THE WE'VE ALREADY HAVE THIS IS PART OF A TO US DEAL YOU WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR BUT- IN ANY EVENT I WANTED MEMBERS TO UNDERSTAND THIS IS PART OF THE LARGER FRAMEWORK OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR THE LAST NUMBER OF MONTHS. ASK YOU SUPPORT. VERY WELL CENTER MORE LUCK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND REVIEWING THIS BILL WHICH IS RATHER COMPLEX AND HAS ARTS TWO MAJOR COMPONENTS- IT JUST SEEMS AS IF THE CPUC FAILED AND PROVIDING ADEQUATE SUPERVISION FOR A REBATE PROGRAM AND- I JUST BELIEVE THIS MIGHT BE THE WRONG SOLUTION BECAUSE IT DOES AND WILL INCREASE RATES FOR ALL TAXPAYERS AND WE ARE. GOING TO BE HURTING THE POOR IT'S A REGRESSIVE. OPPRESSIVE REQUIREMENTS ON ON THOSE THAT CAN AFFORD IT THE LEAST IT'S A BIGGER PORTION OF THEIR OVERALL PERSONAL BUDGET SIDE I HOPE AS WE LOOK FOR WAYS TO IMPROVE THE ECONOMY WERE NOT TONE DEAF ON WHO'S GONNA BE UNDERWRITING OF THESE EFFORTS- WE ARE IN AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN AND I'LL BE OPPOSED THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU CENTER MORE LOG. CENTER BRADFORD. THANK YOU MISTER CHILL AND- I STAND HERE. CAUTIOUSLY SUPPORTING THIS MEASURE TODAY ARE NOT EXPRESSED SOME MY SAME CONCERNS THAT I DID WHEN I WAS IN ASSEMBLY WHEN GOVERNOR BROWN NEGOTIATED THE CELL SETTLEMENT WITH ENERGY AFTER THE ENERGY CRISIS WITH THE INSTALLATION OF CHARGING STATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND MY CONCERN VAN AS IT IS NOW THAT VERY FEW IF ANY MINORITY CONTRACTORS GOT ANY OF THIS WORK. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY NONE OF THESE CHARGING STATIONS WANTED TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. THE MAJORITY OF THEM WENT INTO SAN DIEGO SACRAMENTO LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO PHIL INDIANA WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE. WORKING PEOPLE TO GO TO ELECTRICAL VEHICLES WE MUST PROVIDE THE INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY IN ORDER FOR THEM TO CHARGE THESE VEHICLES I'M !NG TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING THE AMENDMENT THAT SPEAKS TO ONE I THE GERMANS LEADERSHIP AND- ASKING FOR DIVERSE CONTRACTORS SHOULD BE ADDED BUT I THINK THE LANGUAGE COULD BE. STRENGTHENED TO BE AS IT DOESN'T FALL UNDER GENERAL ORDER ONE FIFTY SIX LIKE A UTILITY. THOUGHT I WOULD ASK THAT. WE NOT JUST GIVE NOTIFICATION TO. MINORITY CONTRACTORS BUT WE MAKE A DIRECT EFFORT TO CONTACT THEM BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY MAKE A DIRECT EFFORT TO USE MINORITY PRINT AND DIGITAL OUTREACH THE CONTACT. NOT ONLY CONTRACTORS BUT A DIVERSE WORKFORCE AS WELL. AND MY QUESTION RADAR AS IT RELATES TO THE H. H. BACK. WITHIN SCHOOLS. ALSO INCLUDES. ON THE PORTABLE BUILDING FACILITIES AS WELL. THANK YOU SIR REFER SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I ALSO LEE- WANNA CONSCIOUSLY SUPPORT THIS BILL I HAVE MANY MANY CONCERNS BUT I WILL START BY AND CLEAN THE COMMENTS OF THE GREAT SENATOR FROM GUARDINO AS IT PERTAINS TO A DIVERSE CONTRACTORS AND HE ALSO STATED WHICH I BELIEVE THAT USUALLY THESE DON'T END UP AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES YOU KNOW WHICH I HAPPEN TO REPRESENT AND SO. ON THERE'S SO MANY ISSUES EMBEDDED IN THIS BILL THAT I USUALLY I'M NOT COMFORTABLE I'M REALLY THAT THEY SHOULD BE SEPARATE BILLS WITH SEPARATE ISSUES- BUT I ALSO JUST HEARD SENATOR HURTS PERSON JUST. ABOUT AMENDMENT MEANING CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS AND I HOPE THAT HE DOES I'M NOT REALLY HAPPY ABOUT THE C. P. C.'S LOCK OF RESPONSIVENESS IN THIS ISSUE AND I THINK THAT THAT'S ALSO AN ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO TACKLE I IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THEY DO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO- AND I'LL JUST. SAY THAT- I HOPE TO SEE THE CEMENT BUT I WILL BEGIN CAUTIOUSLY SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY THANK YOU. VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE SOME SURVEYING THE ROOM- CENTERS SKINNER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THE- ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS IT IS A SUNSET ON THE PORTION THAT WILL USE THE EFFICIENCY FUNDS FOR SCHOOLS CORRECT. A REFERENCE SEEN THE AMENDMENTS YEAH CONSULTANT IS NOT IT'S AT THE ONES THAT ARE READ DIRECT. YES YES- I. IF THIS WERE A PERMANENT CHANGE HI WOULD LIKELY NOT BE SUPPORTED EVEN THOUGH I THINK THE NEED IN OUR SCHOOLS IS ESSENTIAL BUT I THINK RIGHT NOW ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE COVERT PANDEMIC. AND OUR KNOWLEDGE THAT BAD INDOOR AIR QUALITY BAD CIRCULATION OF AIR IN IN INDOORS CAN FURTHER THE PANDEMIC BUT ADDITIONALLY WE KNOW THAT. IT IS UNHEALTHY BANDS THAT OUR SCHOOLS UNFORTUNATELY HAVE FOR WHATEVER REASON THE- EITHER THE DESIGN OR THE H. BACK SYSTEMS IN THEM WHAT HAVE YOU THE INDOOR AIR QUALITY LEVELS ARE BELOW ARE FOR ARE NOT. HEALTHY IN OUR SPEND MOST OF OUR CLASSROOM AND IT AFFECTS THE STUDENT'S ABILITY LEARN EFFECT SO MUCH EFFECTS ANYWAY SO I. GIVEN THAT INTERESTING WHEN I WAS DRIVING TO SACRAMENTO I HEARD ON THE RADIO SOME THAT THAT- CONSTRUCTION THAT STARTS WERE DOWN THE NEW CONSTRUCTION JOBS WERE- DOWN DUE TO PANDEMIC INDUCED ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. AND THIS IS EXACTLY THE TYPE OF WORK THAT IS. IT NEEDED WILL BENEFIT ARE SO. COULD HELP OFFSET SOME OF THAT OTHER DROPPED IN CONSTRUCTION SO WITH THAT I THINK IT'S VERY THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT AT BILL IN VERY IMPORTANT COMPONENTS NOW ON THE TV PART. I WOULD PREFER THAT THERE NOT BE A STRICT REQUIREMENT AROUND THE- P. V. I. T. P. AND MAYBE THAT'S STILL SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DISCUSSED BUT I AM. VERY WILLING TO SUPPORT THE BILL NOW THANK YOU. VERY WELL ANY OTHER SPEAKERS. DO WE HAVE A MOTION ON THIS BILL NOW. CENTER HERTZBERG MOVES THE BILL AND- ASSEMBLY MEMBER TEN WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE SOMECLOSING COMMENTS JUST VERY QUICKLY TO MISTER MAJESTIC PICTURE AND ALL THE SENATORS FOR THEIR DISCUSSION- I WOULD DOES ALSO TO ADDRESS THE SENATORS WORRIED ABOUT DIVERSITY HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO HAVE GREATER DISCUSSION TO ENSURE THAT ON MY- ON MY CELL SHARE YOUR CONCERN AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE. THIS GREEN ECONOMY TEACHES SICK EVERY PART OF THE STATE NOT JUST SOME PARTS OF THE STATE SO. ON THAT'S ALSO ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE- WERE TRYING TO GET THE P. YOU SEE TO MAKE A DECISION AGAIN. NONE OF SAY WHAT THE DECISION SHOULD BE. WE ASK THAT A DATE CERTAIN BE MADE A DECISION FOR THESE ARE EVEY PROPOSALS THAT HAVE BEEN LANGUISHING THERE FOR NUMBER YEARS NOW. ALSO IN TERMS OF THE CONCERNS FROM MY GOOD FRIEND TO TURN AS WELL AS- SENATOR FROM ORANGE COUNTY REGARDING OUR REPAIR COSTS. AGAIN THERE IS A CURRENT PART OF MY THAT IS SITTING THERE I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT HAS NOT BEEN SPENT- THIS IS MONEY THAT I'VE TRIED TO REPURPOSE IN THE PAST FOR. A CORNER STORES FOR DURATION IT'S OUR MONEY IT'S OUR REPAIR MONEY THAT. HAS BEEN. WAITING THERE AND- WAITING FOR THIS TO BE CLAIMED. IT HASN'T BEEN CLAIMED IT I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU IT'S A FAILURE UPON THE CPU SEES PART. TO ACTUALLY MAKE SURE THE RATE PAYER MONEY GETS BACK TO THE RATE PAYERS DOESN'T ALONG THE CPUC ACCOUNTABLE ôNG IN ORDER. AND SO ALL I UNDERSTAND PEOPLE HAVE. ABOUT THE PROPOSAL. ON THE AGAIN WE THINK THIS A GOOD TIME TO BE USING OUR MONEY. IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS FOR OUR JOBS. AND HAPPY TO HAVE A DEBATE ABOUT WHAT ARE THE PROPOSAL SHOULD BE OUT THERE. BUT I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE SITTING IN THE CPUC BANK ACCOUNT. THAT'S WHY I DON'T THINK. IN THE LASTLY IN TERMS OF TV. D. V. I. T. P. I'M I'M IN THIS VERY- WEIRD POSITION OF HAVING OPPOSITION FROM MY GOOD FRIENDS IN THE CHARGING COMMUNITY WERE USUALLY WORKING VERY VERY CLOSELY. I WOULD JUST HOPE THAT THE TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THIS PROGRAM IT'S A IT'S A TWO DAY TRAINING PROGRAM. IN OFFERED A COMMUNITY COLLEGES AS WELL THAT MANY. MANY PRESSURE PROGRAMS- WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE OF ADEQUATE TRAINING WHO DO THIS KIND OF WORK. AND WE THINK THAT WE DO ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY TO REALLY. BE UTILIZING THESE PROGRAMS ALL AROUND THE STATE AND WITH THAT. TO SPEAK USE VERY MUCH FOR THE- HARDWARE FROM THE COMMITTEE AND JUST RESPECT FOR US RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I JUST WANT TO ADD. WE HAD AN INCIDENT IN SAN DIEGO WHERE WE HAD AN UNTRAINED ELECTRICIAN- THAT WAS INVOLVED IN BUILDING IN A BUS STOP. AND BECAUSE THEY THE ELECTRICAL INSTALLATION IMPROPERLY SOMEBODY SAT AT THE BUS STATION ONCE ELECTROCUTED TO DEATH THE REQUIREMENT THAT YU HAVE FOR TRAINEES VERY REASONABLE THE CONSEQUENCES COULD BE DEADLY ESPECIALLY WILL ELECTRICAL DEALING WITH ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT- ADDITION TO THE BILL AND- I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE GOING TO BE HANDLED IN. ELECTRICAL DEVICES THAT WE REALLY HAVE HIGHLY TRAINED PEOPLE DOING THAT THIS IS A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH IN MANY INSTANCES SO THIS IS NOT ONLY A SAFETY BILL THIS IS A ALSO A BIT BUT DEALS WITH JOB CREATION MANY OTHER THINGS AND THIS IS A WONDERFUL BILL ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANKS FOR MOVING FORWARD. WE HAVE A MOTION AND NOW UP PAST THE CLERK TO CALL THE ROLL ON THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS FOR AB EIGHT FORTY ONE.

THANK YOU MISTER SHEARER AND MEMBERS AND I'M HERE TO PRESENT AV SIXTEEN FIFTY SEVEN ON BEHALF OF THE GREAT ASSEMBLYMAN EDUARDO GARCIA THIS BILL CREATES A BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION TO STUDY AND REPORT. HOW TO DEVELOP A LITHIUM INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA. GLOBAL DEMAND FOR LITHIUM IS EXPECTED TO GROW BY A FACTOR OF TEN IN THE NEXT DECADE. BUT VIRTUALLY MATTER OF THIS PRODUCT IS PRODUCED. IN UNITED STATES AND WE SHOULD ALL BE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. THE SALTON SEA GERALD BERMAN RESEARCH AREA HOUSE OF SUFFICIENT LOOK BEYOND DEPOSITS IF UTILIZE PRODUCTION COULD BE SUBSTANTIAL. DEVELOPING A LITHIUM INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA WILL ALSO LIVE ECONOMY IN AREAS LIKE THE SALTON SEA. THE LEMONADE SOME OF THE EXPLOITATION THAT'S HAPPENING IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES WITH A LOT OF MINERS MINING FOR THOSE MATERIALS. KILL BERMAN ENERGY IS ALSO PART OF A BALANCED LIKE TRICITY GREER. AND WE'RE LUCKY THAT CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIANS GERALD BOARMAN RESEARCHES CAN ALSO BE USED TO ATTRACT LITHIUM. AB SIXTY FIFTY SEVEN WILL MOVE THE BALL FOR ON THE CAN PRODUCTIONS IN THIS STATE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS TIM KELLY.

TO LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR WHAT COULD BE A VERY VERY IMPORTANT PART OF CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC FUTURE THE ABILITY TO EXTRACT LITHIUM FOR THERMAL BRIAN. CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A WIN WIN SO THE CALIFORNIA CAN CREATE ITS OWN SO BECAUSE OF HIM THAT WILL BE NEEDED FOR BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND OTHER PURPOSES WHILE ALSO CREATING ANOTHER REVENUE SOURCE TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT CHIU THIRD ENERGY WHICH IS CENTER BRADFORD MENTIONED. IMPORT PART OF. BUT US FOR NOT. WE ALSO HAVE TO KELLY REPRESENT IN IMPAIR VALLEY CAN TO CORP HE ON THE- IS MISTER ON THE LINE. I AM ON THE- WELCOME I AM ON THE- THANK YOU. WITHIN CALDWELL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION CURRENTLY THE APPROACH AND PRODUCES OVER FIVE HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF CLEAN CLEAN RELIABLE BASELOAD POWER TO THE GRID THE FOLLOWING THREE HUNDRED ON A RESOURCE THERE HAS POTENTIAL FOR TO DO.

ON WELCOME NOT IN IT IN SOME A CHALLENGE OF THE CALL THE TO PAUSE FROM OTHER STATES. THE FIRST BENEFITS. BUT AFTER IN ENERGY NEED. TO POWER THE EXTRACTION. THE PHARMACY BECAUSE THERE ARE A GOOD FOR THE GREATEST OPPORTUNITY FOR LET. EXTRACTION IS LOCATED. IT IT THROUGH MULTIPLE STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATORS. ALTHOUGH THE PROCESS IS NOT THE PROBLEM IT'S THE TIME FRAME IT TAKES TO DO IT. GENERAL ENERGY DOES NOT BENEFIT FROM THE PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT BECAUSE IT TAKES MORE THAN ONE YEAR TO. TO EXPLORE CONSTRUCT. A GENERAL PLAN. WE NEED PROGRAMS THAT WILL DO YOU READ THESE ENDEAVORS EVERY YEAR FOR ALL ENERGY COMPANY IN THE PRO CAN USE PLANNING IN THE EXPANDING AND MOST ARE EXPLORING THE POSSIBILITIES OF MINERAL LITHIUM EXTRACTION. ENERGY GENERATION AND LET THEM EXTRACTION IS ONLY HALF THE OPPORTUNITY. IF WE COULD ALSO TRACTOR SUPPLY CHAIN AND MANUFACTURE COMPONENTS AND FINISHED PRODUCTS.
