WE'VE HEARD FROM MANY LOW GOVERNMENTS TO PUBLIC OFFICIALS AS WELL AS COMMUNITY MEMBERS. ABOUT THE NEED FOR CLARITY ON WHAT AUTHORITY LEGISLATIVE CAN EXERCISE WITH REGARD TO REMOVING. INDIVIDUALS WHO IS WHO ARE DISRUPTING A PUBLIC MEETING. DUE IN PART TO THE WIDE RANGE OF DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS OF BY VARIOUS COUNCILS AND ATTORNEYS WHAT BUT ACROSS THE STATE. AS WE'V BEEN SEEN MANY TROUBLING INCIDENTS ACROSS THE STATE INCLUDING THOSE INVOLVING HARASSMENT THREATS OF VIOLENCE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE NEED TO PROTECT SAFETY AND PUBLIC MEETINGS.

ON WITHOUT HIM IMPACTING OF THE CONTENT OF THE SPEECH THAT THAT INDIVIDUALS WOULD OTHERWISE PROVIDE- DURING A MEETING- IT IT GIVES IS ESSENTIALLY- CLEARER DEFINITION TO COUNTY COUNCILS IN IN CITY- ATTORNEYS IN TOWN. ATTORNEYS LIKE IN THE TOWN OF LOS GATOS OF MY DISTRICT WHERE. THEY WORK CLEAR EVEN THOUGH A SCUFFLE WAS GOING ON- AS TO.

AND YOU KNOW THAT THE RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE TO BOARD MEMBERS TO COUNCIL MEMBERS TO HAVE SOMEONE REMOVED FROM THE MEETING IF THEY ARE BEING EXCESSIVELY DESTRUCTIVE IF A SCUFFLE IS BREAKING OUT MOST CERTAINLY. LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN INTERVENE AND HAVE THOSE PEOPLE REMOVED AND CERTAINLY IS WITHIN THEIR PURVIEW TO RECESSED THE MEETING UNTIL THEY CAN GET IT UNDER CONTROL IN RE CAN MEET SO THAT IS ALREADY ESTABLISHED STATE LAW WITH THIS BILL- I WORRY DOES IS SENDS A MESSAGE. TO SCHOOL BOARDS AND CITY COUNCILS AND FORTY SUPERVISORS MEMBERS THAT IF ANYONE COMES FORWARD IN DISAGREES WITH THE POSITION OF THE BOARD MEMBERS OR HAS- AND YOU KNOW SOME GRAPE THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO AIR IN PUBLIC.

SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NINETY SIX BY SENATOR MEN RELATIVE TO ANNIVERSARY OF LOS ANGELES RIOTS CENTERMAN THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I TODAY I RISE TO SENT CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NINETY SIX WHICH RECOGNIZES THE THIRTIETH ANNIVERSARY THE LOS ANGELES RIOTS AND UPRISINGS WHOSE MEMORY STILL LINGERS ON PARTICULARLY IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THE LOS AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AREA. I'LL A SOPHOMORE IN HIGH SCHOOL IN A CALIFORNIA SUBURB WHEN THIS- RIGHT OCCURRED I REMEMBER WATCHING THE VERDICT COME DOWN AND BEING SHOCKED BY THIS WATCHING THE RIOTS BREAK OUT. AND I THINK FOR ME AS A KOREAN AMERICAN. I WAS THE FIRST TIME I REALLY STARTED UNDERSTAND THE RADIATION FRUSTRATION HELD BY OUR- BLACK COMMUNITIES OVER CENTURIES OF HISTORY IN THIS COUNTRY OF SUBJUGATION. AND SYSTEMIC RACISM. I AND I THINK I'LL ALSO. RELEASED START TO CONNECT THE DOTS ON ON HOW- THE GREEN COMMUNITY. NEEDED TO BE ENGAGED IN I THINK IS A LESSEN THE MANY KOREAN AMERICANS TOOK AWAY FROM THESE RIGHTS THAT. WE COULDN'T JUST KEEP OUR HEADS DOWN AND- FOCUS ON THE SUCCESS OUR BUSINESSES ARE OUR OWN DEALINGS THAT WE HAD TO PROACTIVELY ENGAGE GET INVOLVED IN POLITICS. AND BUILD COALITIONS WITH OUR NEIGHBORS WITH OTHER COMMUNITIES- AND THAT- I THINK WAS A LESSON THAT EVERYONE TOOK AWAY AT THE RIGHTS OF COURSE BECAUSE- UNTOLD DAMAGE THAT WAS CONCENTRATED IN KOREATOWN. AN ESTIMATED TWENTY THREE HUNDRED KOREAN RUN BUSINESSES WERE DESTROYED- MANY ENTREPRENEURS LOST THEIR LIVELIHOODS ALL TOLD THAT LOSS OF PROPERTY WAS ONE BILLION DOLLARS- BUT THE STORY THE UPRISING OF COURSE WASN'T JUST ABOUT DAMAGES ARE LOOTING- IT WAS- I THINK IT THE SEEDS OF A DIALOGUE THAT HAS CONTINUED TO THIS DAY BETWEEN. THE BLACK AND KOREAN AMERICAN COMMUNITIES IN LOS ANGELES AND AROUND THE COUNTRY- AND I WAS PLEASED LONG SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE IN THIS ROOM AND IN THE OTHER CHAMBER. TO ATTEND A NUMBER OF EVENTS WHERE WE REKINDLE THOSE CONVERSATIONS. AND I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO THINK ABOUT HAVING TODAY AS WELL AT A TIME WHEN ANTI ASIAN HATE IS- SOMETHING THAT DOMINATES OUR HEADLINES. WHEN WE SEE WITH THE GEORGE FLOYD IN SO MANY OTHER INSTANCES OF SYSTEMIC ANTI BLACK RACISM- I DID THIS PROBLEM CONTINUES TO BE SYSTEMIC AND ENDEMIC IN OUR SOCIETY- WE NEED TO BUILD THOSE COALITIONS WE NEED TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS MEMORIALIZES THE PAIN AND HURT- AS AS WELL AS THE CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE THAT WE NEED TO HAVE. I THINK THIRTY YEARS LATER I THINK MOST OF US WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE WE'VE MADE PROGRESS BUT THERE IS STILL SIGNIFICANT WORK LEFT TO BE DONE. AND I'M HOPING THAT THIS RESOLUTION WILL SEND A SIGNAL THAT. HATE I'M SO- A SIGNAL THAT- THAT THAT WE TO HAVE THOSE DIALOGUES- SIGNALED HOPE IN REUKA. THAT WE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CONTINUE CAN CONTINUE TO REPAIR THE SCARS. LEFT BEHIND BY RACIAL ANIMOSITIES- THAT HAVE DIVIDED OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND CONTINUE TO DO SO TODAY ONLY BY WORKING TOGETHER IN UNITY WILL WE BE ABLE TO OVERCOME. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR MEN MEMBERS DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. CENTER BRADFORD. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND I'M GOING TO RISE TO AN WHEN MY VOICE TO RECOGNIZING THIS IMPORTANT RESOLUTION AND I REMEMBER VIVIDLY- WATCHING THAT GRAINY VIDEOTAPE. OF RODNEY KING BEING BEATEN WITHIN AN INCH OF HIS LIFE AND THE ARGUMENT ARE THE RESPONSE WAS HE WAS RESISTING. WELL IF A MAN ON THE GROUND LAMB PROSTATE BEING BEAT BY FOUR WOULD BELIEVE RESERVE THAT I'M AFRAID OF WHAT THEY DESCRIBED MOSIS THAT I DO EVERY DAY BECAUSE- THIS MAN- IT WAS. IF IT DID NOT FOR THE FACT. THAT IT WAS INDIVIDUAL WITH A VIDEO CAMERA ON HIS BALCONY AND HAPPEN TO CATCH THIS GRAINY PHOTO- VIDEO I SHOULD SAY OF THIS. THEY WOULD THE OFFICE WOULD TOTALLY LIVE. EVEN THOUGH WE HAD THE VIDEO THEY LIVE. AND WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS SPENDING AND STORE GO PROCTOR'S SPECIALLY IN THE MINORITY COMMUNITY WHEN IT COMES OUT AFTER AMERICANS. AND THE DATE THAT THE VERDICT CAME THROUGH. I REMEMBER I WAS CALLED TO FOR CME CHURCH IN LA ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT AFRICAN AMERICAN CHURCHES WERE. UNITY LEADERS LIKE DAVID- JOHN MACK OF THE URBAN LEAGUE MAYOR TOM BRADLEY VARIOUS OTHER ELECTED OFFICIALS ASSEMBLED THERE THAT NIGHT. TO DISCUSS HOW WE SHOULD REACT TO WHAT CLEARLY WAS AN INJUSTICE BY THE JURY. AND I REMEMBER LEAVING THAT CHURCH THAT NIGHT IN CHOOSING THE TAKE CRENSHAW BOULEVARD HOME FROM LEAVING THE CHURCH TO THE TIME I MADE IT BACK TO GUARDIAN- I LOST TRACK OF THE NUMBER OF FIRES THAT I WITNESSED THE NUMBER OF LOOTING AND RIOTING AND- AS- ALL RIGHT DESTRUCTION AND- BUYERS THAT WERE SO HIGH EVEN THOUGH MY WINDOWS WERE UP I FELT THE HEAT AS I DROVE DOWN FRENCH ALL BOULEVARD IN MY VEHICLE. BUT IT WAS NOT JUST THAT IT WAS ALL THE PENT UP ANGER THAT HAS EXISTED IN THE COMMUNITY ALLEN PRESHEAF MINE COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY FOR. MENTIONING THE UNITY THAT WE NEED TO COME TOGETHER TODAY BUT PART OF THAT ALSO WAS THE KILLING OF A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD AFTER AFTER AN AMERICAN- GIRL LATASHA HARLINS JUST MONTHS BEFORE.

AND BUSH SHOOTER WAS ALSO ACQUITTED WAS GIVEN PROBATION THAT WAS PART OF THE PENT UP ANGER IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND EVEN TODAY MANY OF THOSE PROPERTIES THAT WERE DESTROYED THE STEEL SAID VACANT TODAY SO I STAND HERE TODAY AND HOPING THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM OUR MISTAKES OF THE PAST AND UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S STILL MUCH WORK TO BE DONE.

CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE FORCIBLY STERILIZED LATINOS AS LATE AS THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES IN DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONS AND STERILIZATIONS OF LATINOS IN OUR STATE PRISONS TOOK PLACE EVEN INTO THE TWO THOUSANDS IT WASN'T UNTIL TWENTY FOURTEEN THAT WE BANNED THAT PRACTICE. PANDEMIC IS ANOTHER CASE IN POINT. IN THE FIRST YEAR THE PANDEMIC LATINOS WERE THE BIGGEST DROP IN OUR LABOR WORK FORCE OF ANY DEMOGRAPHIC. MANY OF THEM LEFT THE WORK FORCE NOT ONLY BECAUSE THEIR JOBS WORK SHUT DOWN BUT ALSO BECAUSE THEY HAD RESPONSIBILITY TO TAKE CARE OF FAMILY MEMBERS WHO NO LONGER HAD THAT PLACE TO GO BECAUSE THEY'RE FACILITIES WERE SHUT DOWN. IN FROM AUGUST TO SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND THE TEAM HAS DROPPED OUT OF OUR LABOR FORCE. MANY WHO'VE NOT YET RETURNED. AND OF COURSE UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE SO MANY OF THEM ARE AMONGST OUR LOW WAGE WORKERS THAT HAS BEEN A SERIOUS SERIOUS IMPACT FINANCIALLY ON THEIR FAMILIES. THAT'S WHY I AM VERY PROUD. THAT WE IN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR SIGNED INTO LAW PROTECTIONS FOR HOSPITALITY WORKERS LAST YEAR. AND I AM PROUD THAT THE SENATE HAS ALWAYS PRIORITIZED THE RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS FOR OUR WORK FORCE ESPECIALLY LOW WAGE WORKERS WHICH AS I. JUST MENTIONED REMAINS DOMINATED UNFORTUNATELY BY THE TINA'S IN OUR SERVICE AND OUR CARE SECTORS. BUT SINGLE TOMORROW IS A DAY OF CELEBRATION SAW AND ON A HIGH NOTE THAT THAT IT CERTAINLY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE STRENGTH AND THE FIGHT IN THE SPIRIT THE LATINOS BRING TO OUR STATE AND WITHOUT I ASK YOUR AYE VOTE.
