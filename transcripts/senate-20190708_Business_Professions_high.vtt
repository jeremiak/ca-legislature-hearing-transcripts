PROFESSIONAL VALUES THIS MEANS

00:12:45.564 --> 00:12:46.799
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A GROUP OF

00:12:46.866 --> 00:12:48.868
BAD PROVIDERS THAT ARE

RESPONSIBLE FOR HEALTH

00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:50.336
DISPARITIES.

00:12:50.402 --> 00:12:51.904
RATHER IT IS LIKELY THAT IT'S A

00:12:51.971 --> 00:12:53.739
COLLECTIVE ISSUE THAT INCLUDES

STANDARDIZE CARE.

00:13:01.514 --> 00:13:02.515
THIS IS MOST LIKELY TO HAPPEN

00:13:02.581 --> 00:13:04.717
WHEN PROVIDERS ARE TIRED ON

00:13:04.783 --> 00:13:06.652
CERTAIN OVER BURDENED OR HAD

THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF

FIRST ARTICLES ON HEALTH

00:13:57.102 --> 00:13:58.237
INEQUITY.

00:13:58.304 --> 00:13:59.838
POINTING OUT THAT BLACK PATIENTS

00:13:59.905 --> 00:14:00.639
ESPECIALLY BLACK WOMEN

00:14:00.706 --> 00:14:01.106
[inaudible]

00:14:01.173 --> 00:14:02.775
WENT.

00:14:02.841 --> 00:14:04.476
WHEN TREAT IT MOSTLY BY WHITE

00:14:04.543 --> 00:14:07.146
PHYSICIANS RECEIVE LESS THAN

00:14:07.213 --> 00:14:09.081
THERAPEUTIC CARE?

00:14:09.148 --> 00:14:12.117
NOW AT THAT TIME THE AUTHORS OF

00:14:12.184 --> 00:14:13.686
THE ARTICLE WERE PUZZLED AS TO

00:14:13.752 --> 00:14:15.988
WHY THIS OCCURRED.

00:14:16.055 --> 00:14:18.457
BECAUSE THE PATIENTS WERE ARE

00:14:18.524 --> 00:14:21.160
ACTUALLY PAID ACTORS AND

00:14:21.227 --> 00:14:22.962
EVERYBODY HAD THE SAME THING

00:14:23.028 --> 00:14:23.896
EXCEPT FOR RACE.

00:14:23.963 --> 00:14:25.965
AND GENDER.

00:14:26.031 --> 00:14:27.566
HOWEVER WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF

00:14:27.633 --> 00:14:29.735
THE HEART THE IMPLICIT BIAS

00:14:29.802 --> 00:14:31.303
TESTS STUDIES BEGIN TO MEASURE

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:33.105
THESE PARAMETERS WITHIN OF

00:14:33.172 --> 00:14:33.772
PHYSICIANS.

00:14:33.839 --> 00:14:36.208
IN A TWO THOUSAND AND NINE

00:14:36.275 --> 00:14:38.043
ANOTHER STUDY WAS PUBLISHED.

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:40.346
LOOKING AT OVER TWENTY FIVE

00:14:40.412 --> 00:14:41.947
HUNDRED OF PHYSICIANS AND

00:14:42.014 --> 00:14:43.148
BASICALLY WHAT IT SHOWED WAS

00:14:43.215 --> 00:14:45.818
THAT THESE PHYSICIANS HAD A HIGH

00:14:45.884 --> 00:14:48.354
ANTI BLACK IMPLICIT BIAS.

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.322
IN WHEN THEY LOOKED AT THE THIS

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:53.125
RESULT IN HE DECISION MAKING IT

00:14:53.192 --> 00:14:54.994
SHOW THAT THESE PHYSICIANS MADE

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:58.063
MORE NEGATIVE DECISIONS FOR THE

00:14:58.130 --> 00:14:59.331
OF OUR BLACK PATIENTS RATHER

00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:01.000
THAN WHITES [inaudible]

00:15:01.066 --> 00:15:03.068
SO.

00:15:03.135 --> 00:15:05.604
THIS RAISES THE QUESTION.

00:15:05.671 --> 00:15:06.872
WILL PROVIDE IS BIASES

00:15:06.939 --> 00:15:09.275
INFLUENCED ERASURE DECISIONS.

00:15:09.341 --> 00:15:11.076
I BELIEVE IT IS CLEAR THAT

00:15:11.143 --> 00:15:13.178
PROVIDE A BIASES IMPLICIT OR

00:15:13.245 --> 00:15:15.514
OTHERWISE CONTRIBUTE TO MANY OF

00:15:15.581 --> 00:15:17.516
THE HEALTH INEQUITIES SOME OF

00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:18.083
WHICH HAVE BEEN HIGHLIGHTED

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:21.387
ALREADY.

00:15:21.453 --> 00:15:23.989
AS A FIRST STEP TO RESOLVE THESE

00:15:24.056 --> 00:15:25.958
DISPARITIES INEFFECTIVE

00:15:26.025 --> 00:15:27.126
DIVERSITY A CULTURAL COMPETENCY

00:15:27.192 --> 00:15:30.062
TRAINING MUST INCLUDE IMPLICIT

00:15:30.129 --> 00:15:32.398
BIAS EDUCATION AND TRAINING.

00:15:32.464 --> 00:15:35.067
I CURRENTLY SERVE AS CHAIR OF

00:15:35.134 --> 00:15:36.869
THE SAN DIEGO GANG COMMISSION

00:15:36.935 --> 00:15:38.971
FOR PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION.

00:15:39.038 --> 00:15:39.505
AND WORK CLOSELY WITH LAW

00:15:39.571 --> 00:15:41.940
ENFORCEMENT.

00:15:42.007 --> 00:15:43.409
IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING HAS BEEN

00:15:43.475 --> 00:15:45.444
COOPERATING INTO THEIR TRAINING

00:15:45.511 --> 00:15:47.579
IN SAN DIEGO.

00:15:47.646 --> 00:15:48.180
BUT THE QUESTION IS DOES THIS

00:15:48.247 --> 00:15:50.683
WORK.

00:15:50.749 --> 00:15:52.518
NATIONAL DATA SHOWS IMPLICIT

00:15:52.584 --> 00:15:53.018
BIAS TRAINING CAN MAKE A

00:15:53.085 --> 00:15:54.820
DIFFERENCE.

00:15:54.887 --> 00:15:55.921
BUT THE POSITIVE RESULTS CAN BE

00:15:55.988 --> 00:15:59.124
SHORTLY OF IT MUST BE SUSTAINED

00:15:59.191 --> 00:16:00.025
AND REINFORCE WITH REPETITIVE

00:16:00.092 --> 00:16:02.361
TRAINING.

00:16:02.428 --> 00:16:04.296
THIS SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE BECAUSE

00:16:04.363 --> 00:16:06.565
WE KNOW THAT THE LIFE LONG LEARN

00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:10.069
SOCIALIZE STEREO TYPING TRIGGERS.

00:16:10.135 --> 00:16:11.537
THAT LEAD TO BIASES ARE

00:16:11.603 --> 00:16:13.872
REPEATEDLY IMPRINTED INTO A SUB

00:16:13.939 --> 00:16:15.374
CONSCIENCE.

00:16:15.441 --> 00:16:17.543
THROUGHOUT OUR LIFE IN CAN ONLY

00:16:17.609 --> 00:16:18.777
BE REMEDIED.

00:16:18.844 --> 00:16:21.447
WITH REPEATED ATTEMPTS AT RE

00:16:21.513 --> 00:16:23.349
SOCIALIZING UP FRONT.

00:16:23.415 --> 00:16:25.617
SO I BELIEVE A. B. TWO FORTY ONE

00:16:25.684 --> 00:16:27.953
WILL SERVE AS A NECESSARY FIRST

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:29.922
STEP TO ADDRESSING CRUCIAL

00:16:29.988 --> 00:16:30.289

HOWEVER AFTER CONVERSATIONS WITH

NUMEROUS STAKEHOLDERS IT HAS

00:24:47.285 --> 00:24:48.520
BECOME CLEAR THAT PATIENTS AND
