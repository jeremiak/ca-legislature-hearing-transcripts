THE SENATE'S RULES- IN TERMS OF

BE RIGHT NOW BUT AT SOME POINT

01:33:08.683 --> 01:33:11.052
I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL-

01:33:11.118 --> 01:33:12.987
GIVEN THE PASSION ON BOTH

01:33:13.054 --> 01:33:15.489

FOR THE RULING AT THIS SO- BUT

01:33:29.670 --> 01:33:31.305
THAT'S ONE PROCEDURAL POINT I'M

01:33:31.372 --> 01:33:32.673
HOPING WE CAN GET SOME CLARITY

01:33:32.740 --> 01:33:35.676
ON- IT IS SUBSTANTIVE LEVEL

01:33:35.743 --> 01:33:40.848
HERE ON THIS LEGISLATION. I

01:33:40.915 --> 01:33:43.951
THINK THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT TO

01:33:44.018 --> 01:33:46.854
BE HEARD RIGHT NOW AT THIS

01:33:46.921 --> 01:33:50.257
MOMENT. DESPITE THE CODE CRISIS

01:33:50.324 --> 01:33:52.660
GOING ON AND ACTUALLY BECAUSE

01:33:52.727 --> 01:33:55.096
OF IT THE ADMINISTRATION IS

01:33:55.162 --> 01:33:58.933
CURRENTLY UNDERTAKING ACTION.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.001
IN THIS SPACE AND THE

01:34:00.067 --> 01:34:02.336
OPPOSITION OF THE PETROLEUM

01:34:02.403 --> 01:34:03.938
ASSOCIATION IS CORRECT THAT

01:34:04.005 --> 01:34:04.405
THERE ALREADY IS AN

01:34:04.472 --> 01:34:06.941
ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING UNDER

01:34:07.008 --> 01:34:09.543
WAY AND SO SOME OF YOU MAY ASK

01:34:09.610 --> 01:34:11.212
THEN WHY IS THIS NECESSARY I

01:34:11.278 --> 01:34:13.614
THINK TO THE LEGISLATURE HAVING

01:34:13.681 --> 01:34:15.216

01:34:35.803 --> 01:34:37.538
REAL RIGHT NOW IN THE CLIMATE

01:34:37.605 --> 01:34:41.142
CRISIS IS VERY MUCH HERE RIGHT

01:34:41.208 --> 01:34:43.511
NOW. THIS IS NOT SO. I THINK WE

01:34:43.577 --> 01:34:45.079
SHOULD BE. TO IT. TO PROCEED

01:34:45.146 --> 01:34:47.381
WITH A AND ALL DUE RESPECT

01:34:47.448 --> 01:34:50.718
BECAUSE I SINCERELY ADMIRE- THE

01:34:50.785 --> 01:34:52.319
GOVERNOR'S INITIATIVE ON THIS

01:34:52.386 --> 01:34:54.321
AS WELL AS OUR LEADERSHIP AT

01:34:54.388 --> 01:34:57.391
BOTH CALLIE PA AND THE NATURAL

01:34:57.458 --> 01:34:58.959
RESOURCES AGENCY I THINK

01:34:59.026 --> 01:35:00.828
THEY'VE LAID OUT A- AN EVIDENCE

01:35:00.895 --> 01:35:02.630
BASED FRAMEWORK. I DON'T THINK

01:35:02.696 --> 01:35:05.099
THIS BILL CONTRAVENES THAT I DO

01:35:05.166 --> 01:35:07.201
THINK THERE MAY BE A DIFFERENT

01:35:07.268 --> 01:35:08.636
OPINIONS AND ALTERNATIVE

01:35:08.702 --> 01:35:10.971
APPROACHES. TO ADDRESSING THIS

01:35:11.038 --> 01:35:12.506
ISSUE AND I WELCOME THAT DEBATE

01:35:12.573 --> 01:35:13.774
AMONG THE MEMBERS I THINK

01:35:13.841 --> 01:35:14.442
THAT'S A VERY HEALTHY

01:35:14.508 --> 01:35:16.010
CONVERSATION TO HAVE IN TERMS

01:35:16.077 --> 01:35:19.213
OF- YOU KNOW HOW HOW YOU LAY

01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:22.083
OUT A FRAMEWORK. DO YOU TO

01:35:22.149 --> 01:35:23.684
MANDATE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF

01:35:23.751 --> 01:35:25.719
FOOTAGE FOR SET BACK DO YOU

01:35:25.786 --> 01:35:27.721
REQUIRE SET BACK AT ALL- IS

01:35:27.788 --> 01:35:30.391
THERE A BETTER WAY. TO REGULATE

01:35:30.458 --> 01:35:31.592
OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS ON

01:35:31.659 --> 01:35:33.894
STRICT HEALTH AND SAFETY BASIS

01:35:33.961 --> 01:35:37.198
I THINK THERE ARE- VALLEY VIEW

01:35:37.264 --> 01:35:39.733
POINTS- ON BOTH ON ALL SIDES OF

01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:42.369
THAT ISSUE I TAKE. THE AUTHORS

01:35:42.436 --> 01:35:44.505
LEGISLATION TO HEW VERY CLOSELY

01:35:44.572 --> 01:35:45.773
TO THE PENNY ADMINISTRATIVE

01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:48.442
ACTION- IF YOU'LL NOTICE A LOT

01:35:48.509 --> 01:35:50.010
OF THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL IS

01:35:50.077 --> 01:35:53.380
SHALL QUE PETER. SO THE TWENTY

01:35:53.447 --> 01:35:56.884
FIVE HUNDRED THAT I KNOW IS.

01:35:56.951 --> 01:35:59.453
CONCERT TWO. MANY OF OUR

01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:00.054
CALLERS IN MANY OF THE STATE

01:36:00.121 --> 01:36:02.656
CALL HERE I UNDERSTAND THAT TO

01:36:02.723 --> 01:36:06.560
BE- NOT A MANDATORY US AMOUNT

01:36:06.627 --> 01:36:10.264
OF SET BACK BUT THE AMOUNT THAT

01:36:10.331 --> 01:36:10.831
SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN THE

01:36:10.898 --> 01:36:13.567
PRECEDING I THINK THAT'S A

01:36:13.634 --> 01:36:15.269
THAT'S A HEALTHY AN IMPORTANT

01:36:15.336 --> 01:36:17.771
METRIC TO UNDERTAKE IS A

01:36:17.838 --> 01:36:20.141
CONSIDERATION BUT I WOULD NOTE

01:36:20.207 --> 01:36:21.675
THAT THIS LEGISLATION DOESN'T

01:36:21.742 --> 01:36:26.147
MANDATE THAT- I ALSO DON' SEE

01:36:26.213 --> 01:36:29.950
ANYTHING IN CURRENT LAW THAT

01:36:30.017 --> 01:36:32.686
WOULD STATE THAT. IS NURSES

01:36:32.753 --> 01:36:34.155
EARLIER TAKING AND I THINK

01:36:34.221 --> 01:36:36.757
PRESIDENT THEY SHOWN THAT IN.

01:36:36.824 --> 01:36:37.758

THIS COUNTRY THAT HAVE SUCH

01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:42.163

COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS- RECOGNIZE

01:36:45.166 --> 01:36:47.134
THE IMPORTANCE OF ZONING AND

01:36:47.201 --> 01:36:50.504
LOCAL. ADMINISTRATORS IN

01:36:50.571 --> 01:36:52.339
ADDRESSING SOME OF THESE LAND

01:36:52.406 --> 01:36:54.008

01:58:44.884 --> 01:58:46.185
CHILDREN IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND

01:58:46.252 --> 01:58:49.121
I THINK SET AS I AM IN MY

01:58:49.188 --> 01:58:50.957
PREVIOUS COOPER ON THE OF

01:58:51.023 --> 01:58:54.927
SUPERVISORS IN A FIRE CON. AT

01:58:54.994 --> 01:58:59.632
BELIEVE THAT. LOOKING AT EIGHT

01:58:59.699 --> 01:59:01.868
UNDER. THIS OF ORACLE. IN THIS

01:59:01.934 --> 01:59:04.637
ED EXPERIENCE. NOW WE'RE

01:59:04.704 --> 01:59:08.274
TALKING ABOUT WELLS AND

01:59:08.341 --> 01:59:09.542
EXTRACTION SITES BEING SHUT

01:59:09.609 --> 01:59:14.580
DOWN TO THE TUNE OF I THINK ONE

01:59:14.647 --> 01:59:21.320
BEST WAS 60% 66% THE OIL AND

01:59:21.387 --> 01:59:24.323
GAS WELLS IN LEE COUNTY ALL.

01:59:24.390 --> 01:59:28.227
DOWN MY BRAIN IDEA THAT WE'RE

01:59:28.294 --> 01:59:29.395
SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING AFTER

01:59:29.462 --> 01:59:31.497
THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELFARE

01:59:31.564 --> 01:59:33.733
IN A COVERT CONTEXT. YET

01:59:33.799 --> 01:59:35.635
SIMULTANEOUSLY BEING PREPARED

01:59:35.701 --> 01:59:37.737
TO SHED THOUSANDS OF JOBS WHEN

01:59:37.803 --> 01:59:40.640
UNEMPLOYMENT. HAS SKYROCKETED

01:59:40.706 --> 01:59:42.675
EDT HAS NOT BEEN PERFORMING AT

01:59:42.742 --> 01:59:45.311
A LEVEL THAT IS MAKING OUR

01:59:45.378 --> 01:59:47.747
COMMUNITIES- RELATIVELY

01:59:47.813 --> 01:59:51.150
FUNCTION. MY LAST POINT ON THIS.

01:59:51.217 --> 01:59:54.487
WHAT DOES A GLORIA

01:59:54.554 --> 01:59:57.823
REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAM TO HELP

01:59:57.890 --> 01:59:59.358
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE GROUPS

01:59:59.425 --> 02:00:01.727
MEANINGFULLY PARTICIPATE IN

02:00:01.794 --> 02:00:06.065
AGENCY REGULATORY PROCESSES.

02:00:06.132 --> 02:00:07.700
I'VE BEEN AROUND GOVERNMENT

02:00:07.767 --> 02:00:09.235
LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT WHEN

02:00:09.302 --> 02:00:10.570
YOU HAVE LANGUAGE LIKE THAT

02:00:10.636 --> 02:00:14.941
INCORPORATED INTO. BILL I

02:00:15.007 --> 02:00:19.178
BECOME SUSPICIOUS. IF IT'S TRUE

02:00:19.245 --> 02:00:21.013
TRULY ABOUT HEALTH AND WELFARE.

02:00:21.080 --> 02:00:22.815
ABOUT MAKING CERTAIN THAT

02:00:22.882 --> 02:00:24.116
THERE'S A SETBACK BETWEEN

02:00:24.183 --> 02:00:27.086
EXTRACTION SITES IN SCHOOLS

02:00:27.153 --> 02:00:28.554
EXTRACTION SITES AND HOSPITALS.

02:00:28.621 --> 02:00:30.022
THAT GIVING MONEY TO

02:00:30.089 --> 02:00:32.825
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE GROUPS TO

02:00:32.892 --> 02:00:36.162
BECOME ADVOCATES ARE IN IT IN

02:00:36.228 --> 02:00:40.666
ADVANCE. A POLITICAL AGENDA I'M

02:00:40.733 --> 02:00:41.801
NOT SO CERTAIN IS THE USE OF

02:00:41.867 --> 02:00:43.302
TAXPAYER MONEY. SO WHEN YOU ADD

02:00:43.369 --> 02:00:45.471
IT ALL UP THIS IS COVE IN

02:00:45.538 --> 02:00:47.640
NINETEEN RELATED. THIS IS GOING

02:00:47.707 --> 02:00:49.575
TO SHED JOBS AT THE WORST TIME

02:00:49.642 --> 02:00:53.112
POSSIBLE IT'S GIVING MONEY AWAY

02:00:53.179 --> 02:00:54.847
TO ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS TO

02:00:54.914 --> 02:00:58.884
PURSUE A- LEGISLATIVE SET OF.

02:00:58.951 --> 02:01:00.519
ORDERS I THINK SHOULD

02:01:00.586 --> 02:01:03.456
DEFINITELY BE WITHDRAWN IN

02:01:03.522 --> 02:01:05.958
BROUGHT BACK IN JANUARY AND ON

02:01:08.494 --> 02:01:10.096
COST ESTIMATE THAT IF ALL THESE

02:01:10.162 --> 02:01:12.765
EXTRACTION SITES WERE SHUT DOWN.

02:01:12.832 --> 02:01:13.933
WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN TO OUR

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:18.371
ECONOMY TO OUR EMPLOYEES INTO

02:01:18.437 --> 02:01:18.971

THIS DEBATE UNNECESSARILY TODAY

02:01:34.420 --> 02:01:36.422
I THINK THE POINT WAS MADE BY

02:01:36.489 --> 02:01:37.990
SENATOR HERTZBERG THAT WE

02:01:38.057 --> 02:01:41.160
ALREADY HAVE ASSIST UNDER

02:01:41.227 --> 02:01:43.663
THAT'S MUCH MORE DETAIL THAN

02:01:43.729 --> 02:01:44.864
THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL THAT

02:01:44.930 --> 02:01:46.966
WILL MORE THAN IN THIS BILL

02:01:47.033 --> 02:01:49.402
WILL PLUS. ONLY THE THAT

02:01:49.468 --> 02:01:51.737
PROCESS WHICH I DON'T SUPPORT.

02:01:51.804 --> 02:01:54.840
BUT I DO WANT TO SPY I THINK I

02:01:54.907 --> 02:01:57.043
CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION OF WHY

02:01:57.109 --> 02:01:58.344
WE'RE HERE IN AND OUT IT'S NOT

02:01:58.411 --> 02:01:59.712
A IT'S NOT A GOOD ANSWER

02:01:59.779 --> 02:02:01.480
UNFORTUNATELY I'M NOT NOT TO

PLEASE WILL LIVE. HERE THIS IS

02:02:05.051 --> 02:02:07.253
ACTUALLY A WASTE OF EVERYBODY'S

02:02:07.319 --> 02:02:08.721
TIME UNFORTUNATELY. AND I WANT

02:02:08.788 --> 02:02:10.222
TO APOLOGIZE TO EVERYBODY THAT

02:02:10.289 --> 02:02:12.224
HAD CALLED IN TODAY I. WANNA

02:02:12.291 --> 02:02:14.927
APOLOGIZE FOR EVERYONE IN THE

02:02:14.994 --> 02:02:16.862
PUBLIC FOR THIS. THIS THIS

02:02:16.929 --> 02:02:18.597
EXERCISE IT REALLY WILL NOT

02:02:18.664 --> 02:02:20.533
REALLY ACHIEVE. ANYTHING AT ALL

02:02:20.599 --> 02:02:22.501
WHEN YOU WERE HERE. BUT TO WORK

02:02:22.568 --> 02:02:23.669
WITH THE GOVERNMENT GOVERNORS

02:02:23.736 --> 02:02:26.005
ARE TAKING. AND HOW DETAILED IT

02:02:26.072 --> 02:02:29.341

OF THE GOVERNOR AND I THINK

02:02:36.882 --> 02:02:38.150
IT'S MORE DETAILED AND I THINK

02:02:38.217 --> 02:02:43.255
IT'S A- HOME THE WORK OF THE

02:02:43.322 --> 02:02:44.557

THIS LADIES AND GENTLEMAN IS

02:03:03.342 --> 02:03:06.545
