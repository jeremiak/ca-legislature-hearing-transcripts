AS WE ALL KNOW CLIMATE CHANGE IS ALREADY HAVING STAGGERING IMPACTS ALL ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DROUGHTS WILDFIRES HEAT WAVES CATASTROPHIC WEATHER EVENTS OF INCREASING SEVERITY. THESE IMPACTS ARE ONLY EXPECTED TO INTENSIFY POSING A SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO CALIFORNIA. IF CALIFORNIA HOPES TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE STATE LEADERS WILL NEED TO DEPLOY THE FULL RANGE OF TECHNOLOGIES AVAILABLE TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THIS INCLUDES CARBON CAPTURE WHICH LEADING EXPERTS IDENTIFIED AS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF A SUCCESSFUL STRATEGY TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND ALL AROUND THE WORLD. UNDER CURRENT LAW THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE ON CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES WITH AN ANNUAL REPORT ON EMISSIONS OF GREENHOUSE GASES CRITERIA POLLUTANTS AND TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS. GIVEN THAT EXPERTS HAVE IDENTIFIED CARBON CAPTURE IS A KEY COMPONENT OF OUR FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE. IT IS APPROPRIATE TO INCLUDE AN UPDATE ON HOW CARBON CAPTURE IS CONTRIBUTING TO THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS. THIS INFORMATION WILL BE VALUABLE IN INFORMING FUTURE DECISIONS ABOUT HOW CARBON CAPTURE TECHNOLOGIES CAN BE DEPLOYED AS A PART OF OUR STRATEGY TO COMBAT THE CLIMATE CRISIS.

THANK YOU. THAT I SAW DOCTOR RAMBLE IN THE BACK. DR ARAMBULA PRESENTING AB. TWENTY FIVE FIFTY. THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I AM THE GREAT I AM GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FIVE FIFTY. I APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S GUIDANCE AND I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS FOCUSED ON THE SANJOAQUIN VALLEY AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT. CALIFORNIA'S TOP LEADERS ARE COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING OUR STATE SEVERE ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES AB TWENTY FIVE FIFTY IS FOCUSED ON THE URGENT NEED TO IMPROVE THE AIR QUALITY IN THE EIGHT COUNTIES THAT MAKE UP THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. IT IS THE FACT THAT FRESNO COUNTY HAS THE WORST AIR FOR PARTICLE POLLUTION IN THE UNITED STATES. ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION. AND KERN COUNTY RANKS SECOND. IN FRESNO COUNTY ALONE THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION ESTIMATES THERE ARE NEARLY TWENTY THOUSAND CASES OF PEDIATRIC ASTHMA AND OVER SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND CASES OF ADULT ASTHMA. THIS CRISIS IS PARTICULARLY HARMFUL FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WHERE ARE BAD AIR QUALITY COMPOUNDS ADVERSE EVENTS ON CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT. IN MISSED DAYS AT WORK AND IMMEDIATE HEALTH L. AILMENTS AS WELL AS LONG TERM CHRONIC CONDITIONS. AND AT ITS WORST WE KNOW THAT BAD AIR CONTRIBUTES TO PREMATURE DEATHS UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY ESTABLISHED AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS TO ADDRESS THE GRAVE HEALTH IMPACTS OF AIR POLLUTION. TWENTY FIVE YEARS LATER THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT STILL HASN'T MET THOSE STANDARDS LET ALONE MORE RECENT ONES. THE STATUS QUO IS NOT ACCEPTABLE IN THE FACE OF DECADES LONG HEALTH CRISIS THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD MUST ENGAGE MORE STRONGLY ON THIS BOTH ON MOBILE HOME AND STATIONARY SOURCES. ULTIMATELY IT IS THE STATE'S RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE INCLUDING OUR PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY CAN BREATHE CLEANER AIR AND NOT SUFFER FROM THE IMPACTS OF POLLUTION. AB TWENTY FIVE FIFTY SIX ONLY TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL INVOLVEMENT BY THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD IN AN EFFORT VALLEYS AIR QUALITY. THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE VALLEY RESIDENTS CANNOT WAIT ANY LONGER DOCTOR CATHERINE GROUP UP WHITE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY AIR COALITION AND GLORIA ALONSO CRUZ PROJECT COORDINATOR FOR LITTLE MANILA RISING. GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MEMBERS DR CATHERINE GROUP A WHITE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY AIR QUALITY COALITION WORKING TO RESTORE CLEAN AIR TO THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY ON UNSEEDED YOUR COULD SEND ME WHAT PLANS WE ARE THE MOST POLLUTED AIR BASIN FOR FINE PARTICLES AND ONE OF THE MOST POLLUTED FOR OZONE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FIVE FIFTY AIR POLLUTION CONTRIBUTES TO NUMEROUS NEGATIVE HEALTH IMPACTS ECONOMIC IMPACT AND OUR ROADS QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. ROUGHLY ONE IN FIVE CHILDREN IN THE VALLEY HAVE ASTHMA MORE PEOPLE IN OUR REGION DIE EACH YEAR FROM FINE PARTICLE POLLUTION THAN CAR ACCIDENTS THE WILD FIRES AND- EXTREME HEAT WHICH ARE ACCELERATING CLIMATE IMPACTS COUPLED WITH ISSUES LIKE THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC ARE WORSENING THIS ALREADY DIRE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. THE STATIONARY AN AREA WIDE SOURCES UNDER THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY OR DISTRICTS CONTROL OUR WHERE ENFORCEMENT AND REDUCTIONS ARE MOST NEED MEET OUR CLEAN AIR GOALS GIVEN THE DISTRICT'S LONG HISTORY OF FAVORING INDUSTRY AT THE EXPENSE OF PUBLIC HEALTH WE CONTINUE TO BLOW THROUGH DEADLINES TO MEET STANDARDS THAT ARE SO OLD THEY CAN NO LONGER BE CONSIDERED BE CONSIDERED HEALTH PROTECTIVE. THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY HAS NOT MET THE NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE OZONE STANDARD OR THE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN STANDARD FOR FINE PARTICLES. AB TWENTY FIVE FIFTY CREATES A MIDDLE PATH BETWEEN A COMPLETE TAKEOVER OF THE AIR DISTRICT OR THE CURRENT HANDS OFF REVIEW. BY REQUIRING A COLLABORATIVE PLANNING PROCESS THAT ENSURES INCLUSION OF COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD IS WELL POSITIONED TO ASSIST WITH ADDITIONAL ENFORCEMENT MEASURES AND STRATEGIES. NEED TO NEEDED TO MEET CLEAN AIR GOALS IN THE VALLEY GIVEN THEIR STRONG COMMITMENTS ON ELECTRIFYING MOBILE SOURCES. THEIR HIGH COMPLIANCE RATES WITH EXISTING REGULATIONS AND RECENT SUCCESSES LIKE THE COLLABORATIVE EFFORT TO PHASE OUT OPEN AGRICULTURAL BURNING IN OUR REGION. TO HELP RESTORE CLEANER AND IMPROVE HEALTH EQUITY IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY PLEASE VOTE YES ON AB TWENTY FIVE FIFTY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM OUR OUR SECOND WITNESS VICE CHAIRS ON THE PHONE GLORIA ALONSO CRUZ AS A BRILLIANT POINT THANK YOU WILL GO TO THE PHONE LINE FOR THE SECOND WITNESS. WELL CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY MY NAME IS CLAUDIA ALONSO GROUP FAMILY COMMUNITY COMMUNITY MEMBER FROM STOCKTON AND A FORMER US ADVOCATE OR WHAT I'M GONNA WRITE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FIVE FIFTY. I AM HERE TO URGE YOU TO VOTE YES. ON THE BILL BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE SOMEONE WHO HAS WITNESSED THAT THE TRUMP AFFECT OF AIR POLLUTION IN MY COMMUNITY I BELIEVE THIS WILL ADVANCE THE STANDARDS REQUIRED TO ENSURE THAT COMMUNITIES ACROSS WITHOUT LOOKING VALLEY. BIKES PARKED IN THE ONE THAT I GREW UP IN ARE ON TRACK TO MITIGATE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM. STATIONARY SOURCES. THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY ITS POSITION IN A MULTI LET YOUR AREA OR INADEQUATE REGULATION OF STATIONARY SOURCES HAS BEEN NEGLECTED FOR YEARS FOR YEARS. AND AS A RESULT IT CONTINUES TO COMPROMISE THE HEALTH OF MANY ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES. FOR INSTANCE REGIONAL RESOURCES LIKE THE BIOMASS PLANT IN BOSTON EMIT AIR POLLUTANTS. THAT HARM OUR HEALTH AS PART OF A RESEARCH PROJECT WILL LET HIM KNOW WHAT RISING IN TWENTY TWENTY I LEARNED A POINT RECEIVED TRUCKLOADS OF WOODY WASTE AND IT BURNS SAID THE FARMS JUST LIKE MANY. OTHERS ACROSS WITHOUT LOOKING VALLEY OPERATES TWENTY HOURS. SEVEN DAYS A WEEK AND PRODUCES POLLUTANTS THAT AFFECT LOW INCOME RESIDENTIAL AREA. SCHOOLS PARKS AMONG OTHER RESOURCES THAT WERE SEVERELY AFFECTED DURING THE PANDEMIC AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE AFFECTED DUE TO. CLIMATE CHANGE AND RISING TEMPERATURES. YOU THINK THAT CARP MY TOOL HELPS IDENTIFY THAT THEY AREA IN SOUTH BOSTON. PRODUCES THE HIGHEST GREENHOUSE GAS. OUT RIGHT AND BOB. THIS POLLUTION IS A IN THE LIVES OF OUR CAN. A WAITING FOR THE CALL AIR RESOURCE BOARD PM TWO POINT FIVE TWO ONE FIVE IT'S CLOSE IS FOR ABOUT ONE TWO HUNDRED. OF DEATH IN THE FAMILY CAME ALL THE EACH YEAR MIGHT HELP AND THE HELP OF FOUR POINT THREE. FOUR POINT THREE MILLION SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY BREED THERE IS IMMENSE ACTION. THAT IMPACTS OF AIR POLLUTION COST OUR REGION MORE THAN SIX BILLION EACH YEAR. FOR THIS REASON I ASK YOU TO VOTE YES ON AB TWENTY FIVE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND SORRY ABOUT THAT MISS CRUZ THAT WILL GO TO THE TESTIMONY IN THE BUILDING. NAME AN ORGANIZATION PLEASE FOR SUPPORT. MELISSA ROMERO CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL VOTERS IN SUPPORT. KILLER ROBINSON ON BEHALF OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL ACTION FUND IN SUPPORT THANK YOU FOR BILL MCGOVERN COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE'S SUPPORT. SCENE NINE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S TOM JORDAN I'M WITH THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT. THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB TWENTY FIVE FIFTY AS IT WILL NOT PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL BENEFIT. DOES NOT RECOGNIZE CARBS EXISTING OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY FOR THE COLLABORATIVE PROCESS THAT ARE YOUR CURSE BETWEEN LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS AND CAR. ADDITIONALLY THE BILL DOESN'T PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO ADDRESS MOBILE SOURCE EMISSIONS WHICH ARE THE SINGLE LARGEST CONTRIBUTOR TO THE STATE'S AIR QUALITY CHALLENGES. WE AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR THAT THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY FACES ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT AIR QUALITY CHALLENGES IN THE COUNTRY. I DO TO OUR TOPOGRAPHY CLIMATE GEOGRAPHY IN THE PRESENCE OF TWO MAJOR TRANSPORTATION CORRIDORS THAT TRAVERSE OUR REGION. THE DISTRICT IN CARP HAVE A LONG SUCCESSFUL HISTORY OF WORKING TOGETHER TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT PLANS TO BRING THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THE STATE AND FEDERAL AIR-QUALITY STANDARDS. TO IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH HE'S ACT ACTIVITIES HAVE BROUGHT THE VALLEY INTO ATTAINMENT OF THE FEDERAL STANDARDS FOR ONE HOUR OZONE. PARTICULATE MATTER UNDER TEN MICRONS IN SIZE. THE SIXTY FIVE MICROGRAMS TWENTY FOUR HOUR PORTION OF THE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN PM TWO POINT FIVE STANDARD BIT THE VALLEY AND CARPET JOINTLY DEVELOPED- WE ARE ON TRACK TO RETAINING THE REMAINING AIR QUALITY STANDARDS THAT WERE NON ATTAINMENT FOR. AND DEVELOPING THESE PLANS THE AIR TO LOCAL LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS AND CAR CURRENTLY WORK OINTLY ON DEVELOPING. THE TECHNICAL ELEMENTS OF THESE IMPLANTS THESE PLANS INCLUDING AIR QUALITY MÀ MODELING THE DEVELOPMENT OF EMISSIONS INVENTORIES. AND AIR QUALITY MONITORING THROUGHOUT THE THROUGHOUT THE BUT THE VALLEY. THESE PLANS GO THROUGH A LOCAL PROCESS PUBLIC PROCESS THAT INCLUDES ALL STAKEHOLDERS THEIR TOP AT A LOCAL PUBLIC HEARING THEY THEN GO TO THE STATE THE STATE GO THROUGH A PUBLIC PROCESS IN A PUBLIC HEARING. SUBMITS THOSE PLANS EPA THEY GO THROUGH A PUBLIC PROCESS AND PUBLIC HEARING THERE AS WELL IS IT HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE INVOLVES ALL THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THE ISSUE- AND- WE THINK TWENTY FIVE FIFTY WILL ACTUALLY KIND OF IN P. THAT PROCESS BY MANDATING A SPECIFIC PROCESS THAT WE MUST GO TO. IN CONTROLLING AIR POLLUTION IN CALIFORNIA LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS ARE GIVEN THE AUTHORITY TO DEVELOP RULES AND REGULATIONS OVER STATIONARY SOURCES. CARBS PRIMARY AUTHORITIES THE REGULATION OF MOBILE SOURCES. AND THE AIR DISTRICTS THAT HAVE REDUCED OVER DECADES HAVE DEVELOPED RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT WERE BE REDUCE STATIONARY SOURCE EMISSIONS BY 90% AT THIS STAGE STATIONARY SOURCES MAKE UP ABOUT 15% OF THE NITROGEN OXIDE EMISSIONS AND MOBILE SOURCES ARE ABOUT 85% OF OUR OF OUR ISSUE. WE THINK THAT THE BEST WAY TO BRING CLEANER AIR- TO THE VALLEY AND THE REST OF THE REGION FOR THE STATE IS TO FOCUS ON ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO REDUCE MOBILE SOURCES. THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICT WILL NOT STOP ITS ACTIVITIES TO LOOK AT STATIONARY SOURCES AND LOOK FOR ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. BUT THE BIGGEST OPPORTUNITY IS THE CONTROLLED MOBILE SOURCES. AND WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO. CRACKED UP INTO IT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA AIR POLLUTION CONTROL OFFICERS ASSOCIATION- WE WOULD ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE AND- REALLY IF WE COULD BE FOCUSING OUR EFFORTS ON WAYS TO ACTUALLY GET EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS AND WE THINK THAT THE THAT THIS BILL REALLY DOESN'T PROVIDE MORE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT SO WE WOULD ENCOURAGE FOCUSING MORE BY WILL LOOK FOR YOU KNOW REGULATORY OPPORTUNITIES TO BUT ENCOURAGE. MORE RESOURCES FOR INCENTIVE PROGRAMS SO WE CAN ACCELERATE REDUCTIONS AND IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH FASTER THANK YOU SO MUCH ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM. CENA MOVED TO THE PHONE LINES ANYONE IN SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION ON THE PHONE LINES. YOU'RE IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO ON YOUR PHONE. IN WILL CUT THE LINE NUMBER TWELVE PLEASE CONTACT. DANIEL BROWN ON BEHALF OF SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA AT IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE NETWORK IN COURT THANK YOU. THANK YOU HAVE A CLIMB NUMBER FORTY Q. PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU THIS IS MARK FENSTER BAKER ON BEHALF OF- CHAPTERS IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE. THANK YOU MY NUMBER FORTY PLEASE GO AHEAD. HELLO THE PROCESSING OF THE LEADERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR JUST THE BANK ACCOUNTABILITY CALLING THE SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FIVE FIFTY AND TO INSIST THAT THE BILL REASONABLY BE AMENDED TO INCLUDE THE FALCONS DISTRICT IN OTHER AIR BASE AND THE LISTING MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATION. RELEASE ONLY A SUPPORT POSITION. THANK YOU FOR THE RECORD MY NUMBER THIRTY FIVE. I NUMBER THIRTY FIVE YEAR OPEN. YEAH THIS IS BETTER THAN THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRAL AIR QUALITY CUSHION CONTRIBUTION SUPPORT FOR THE CLIMATE CENTER THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE'RE ABOUT TO LINE NUMBER TWENTY SIX. HELLO THIS IS MARK ROWE'S WITH NATIONAL PARKS CONSERVATION ASSOCIATION CALLING IN SUPPORT. HEY WE DO NOT HAVE ANY MARKET UP IN THE SEARCH CARE THANK YOU ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. AS A MESSAGE THANK YOU- SO- MISTER AMALEK AND COULD YOU. YOU KNOW MY UNDERSTANDING HAS ALWAYS BEEN THAT. LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS FOCUSED ON THE- STATIONARY SOURCES AND THE ARB IS MORE FOCUSED ON THE MOBILE SOURCES. SO HOW IS THE AIR BE BRINGING THAT UP AND BRING IN THEIR B. TO INTERVENE MORE GOING TO HELP- WITH. YOUR YOUR- YOUR ISSUES. I BELIEVE WE HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE FACT THAT AFTER TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF FOR STILL STRUGGLING TO GET INTO ATTAINMENT WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE THE RIGHT REGULATORY AUTHORITY AND- ORGANIZATION WHO'S OVERSEEING IT WITH THE APPROPRIATE URGENCY. FOR THOSE OF US WHO LIVE IN THE VALLEY AND AS YOU HEARD FROM THOSE WHO ARE CALLING AND SUPPORT TODAY OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR HAVE FELT THE IMPACT OF THIS. BAD AIR POLLUTION FOR FAR TOO LONG AND BELIEVE THAT ULTIMATELY THE STATE BEARS RESPONSIBILITY AND WHAT WAS LEFT OUT OF THE OPPOSITION'S COMMENTARY IS. A LOCAL LAWSUIT WHICH IS BEING PLACED AGAINST THE EPA FOR NOT MEETING AND ALLOWING US TO REACH OUR STANDARDS. ULTIMATELY THERE'S SOME- RESPONSIBILITY THAT WE MAY HAVE TO FACE VIA SANCTIONS AS A STATE IF WE DO NOT MEET THAT RESPONSIBILITY AND BELIEVE IT NEEDS TO BE MORE PROACTIVE FROM OUR- AIR RESOURCES BOARD SO THAT WE CAN- AFFECT THE CHANGE WE KNOW NEEDS TO HAPPEN. BY THE WAY THEY COMMITTEE AND ELSE THIS INDICATES A- AN AMENDMENT DID YOU SAY THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE ACCEPTING COMMITTEE OKAY. ALL RIGHT THANK. GOODNESS THANK YOU MISTER ADDED LIKE THE AIRPORT TO RESPOND AS WELL. SO ASSEMBLY MEMBER RANDY LEE MENTIONED A RECENT LAWSUIT ON OUR OUR PM TWO POINT FIVE PLAN THAT WAS SUBMITTED TO EPA AND THERE WERE A NUMBER OF ELEMENTS TO THAT LAWSUIT- EPA FOUND IN FAVOR OF. CARP AND THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS PORTIONS OF THE PLAN AND ALL AREAS BUT ONE. THEY FOUND THAT ON THE STATIONARY SOURCE SIDE WE MET THE REQUIREMENT OF HAVING MOST TRENCHANT MEASURES WHICH MEANS BASICALLY OUR RULES ARE MORE STRINGENT THAN ANY ROLE. ANYWHERE ELSE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. THE ONE AREA THAT THEY FOUND OUR PLAN FELL SHORT. WAS A SHORTFALL IN INCENTIVE FUNDS THAT WERE COMMITTED TO IN THE PLAN TO REDUCE EMISSIONS FROM MOBILE SOURCES- THAT WAS THE ONLY PROVISION OF THE LAWSUIT THAT WE WEREN'T MARC SUCCESSFUL IN DEFENDING. AND AND WE ARE IN NO WAY SAYING OUR WORK HERE IS DONE WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT AT AT THOSE AREAS WHERE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET MORE MATURE REDUCTIONS- BUT WE DO FEEL THAT WERE THE MOST QUALIFIED TO DO THAT. IN OUR REGION. ADAM OR MR VICE CHAIR IF I CAN PULL AND DR CATHERINE GROUP OF WHITE THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AIR COALITION AS WELL TO RESPOND ACCOMPLICE. DR THANK YOU- SO FIRST I WOULD SAY THAT THE RECENT DECISION ON THE LAWSUIT SHOWS THAT WE HAVE A HISTORY OF OVER RELYING ON INCENTIVE DOLLARS AND WE CAN'T JUST KEEP THROWING MONEY IN A BLACK HOLE AND ASSUME THAT IT'S GOING TO GET US THERE. BY OUR OWN ANALYSIS EVEN IF WE WERE ABLE TO OBTAIN THAT ITS INCENTIVE FUNDING WE PROBABLY COULDN'T SPEND IT FAST ENOUGH OR FIND ENOUGH SOURCES TO CLEAN UP. IN ORDER TO MEET THE STANDARDS AND TIME. TO OTHER ELEMENTS OF THIS BILL THAT I THINK ARE REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE IN THE CONVERSATION IS- IT'S ONE THING TO HAVE THE STRONGEST RULES IT'S ANOTHER THING TO ACTUALLY GO OUT AND ENFORCE THEM. WHICH THEIR DISTRICT HAS BEEN LACSON- AND THERE'S DISAGREEMENT WHETHER THERE'S BEST AVAILABLE CONTROL TECHNOLOGY OR BEST AVAILABLE RETROFIT CONTROL TECHNOLOGY AT SOME OF OUR LARGEST AND OLDEST STATIONARY SOURCES. AND THE LAST POINT THAT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT'S WHAT UNIQUE ABOUT THIS BILL. IS IN TRAINING THE INCLUSION OF COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT PREVIOUSLY HAVE BEEN MARGINALIZED IN THE PROCESS OTHER QUESTIONS YES. THIS RACE. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS I THINK SOMETIMES WHEN WE THINK THAT- BECAUSE SOMEBODY HAS THE AUTHORITY TO TAKE CARE OF AN ISSUE IF WE FIND THAT IT'S NOT BEING TAKEN CARE OF. THEN TO FIND SOME OTHER CREATIVE WAYS SO THAT IS TAKEN CARE OF BECAUSE IN THE END JUST AS WAS NOTED IN TH ANALYSIS OF TO MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE SUFFERING FROM THIS THEIR POLLUTION. AND WHATEVER WE HAVE BEEN DOING AND I DON'T THINK IT IS NECESSARILY SAYING SOMETHING BAD ABOUT THE BOARD IS JUST SAYING WE'VE GOT TO FIND SOMETHING ELSE THEY'RE SAYING. IT AS I UNDERSTAND IT A NEW PROGRAM CAN BE PUT TOGETHER AND THAT WILL BE ENFORCED AND IF IT'S IF IT. ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH THEN. SOMETHING ELSE IS GOING TO BE PUT IN BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WE HAVE TO PROTECT. PEOPLE'S LAWNS. ESPECIALLY OUR CHILDREN AND OUR SENIORS- SO WITH THAT I WOULD MOVE THE BILL IF WE HAVE QUORUM. WE WILL JUST A MINUTE WE LOST ONE TO OFFICIALLY BACKS IN- THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. DR EMMET WOULD LIKE CLOSE THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR EXTREME AIR POLLUTION IS AN ISSUE THAT HAS PERSISTED FOR DECADES AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AFTER PASSING FEDERALLY MANDATED DEADLINES IT IS TIME FOR THE STATE TO ENGAGE ON ALL SOURCES OF POLLUTION IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY.

SIX ONE SEVEN PROGRAM BUT AT THE SAME TIME- FORCING US TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE ACTUAL APPROACH THAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO TAKE WHEN IT COMES TO FUNDING. THIS PROGRAM IN A SUSTAINABLE MANNER SO I WANTED JUST TO HIGHLIGHT THAT- WE HAVE PREPARED SOME. AMENDMENTS IN RESPONSE TO THOSE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED AS IT RELATES TO THE SUSTAINABILITY OF JUJHAR FUNDS BEING PUT FORWARD BUT OKAY I WON'T GO INTO A WHOLE LOT OF THESE SO JUST SAY THAT THIS IS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND PROGRAM. SILVER COMPOSITE OVERLOOKED ESTABLISH A CORPORATE CLICK. RIVAS FLOOR FLOOR HERE BOERNER HORVATH HERE FOR A PURPOSE HERE FRIEDMAN GARCIA MATHIS YOUR MATHIS HERE MCCARTY WRONG ROLL CALL- REYES REYES HERE SEYARTO STONE WOULD WOULD HERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF A QUORUM ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK YOU FOR THAT THANK YOU. THE PROPER PROGRAM ESTABLISHES A SUSTAINABLE FUNDING MECHANISM FOR AB SIX ONE SEVEN A PROGRAM THAT IS A FIRST OF ITS KIND IN THE NATION THAT FOCUSES ON A COMMUNITY BASED EFFORT TO FOCUS ON AIR POLLUTION THAT'S IMPACTING. YOU KNOW THE SAME PEOPLE THAT THAT WERE TRYING TO PROTECT IN THE PRIOR BILL RIGHT- RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT HI THIS IS A WILL IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS WE DO HAVE TO INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE CALLING IN. THE FIRST PERSON IS RIVERSIDE COUNTY SUPERVISOR IN SOUTH CLOSER QUALITY BOARD MEMBER THE MANY PER AS FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER WHO WILL BE TESTIFYING VIA PHONE.

I AM ON THE CELL CULTURE QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT AS A BOARD MEMBER. AND NOW CURRENTLY THE SUPERVISOR FOR THE PORT DISTRICT I'M READY AND AS WAS MENTIONED AS WELL I HAD THE PLEASURE AND HONOR AS YOU DO TODAY TO ANSWER OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE. BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. AND I'M CALLING BECAUSE I AM IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY ONE FORTY ONE PEACH TO SERVE AS A SPONSOR OF THE BILL. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW THE PORCHES BUILDERS TO NOT ONLY MY COUNTY. AND THE SOUTH COAST REGION. BUT ALSO TO ALL OF THIS IS THAT IS COMMITTEE STATEWIDE ANDERSON AND THAT I THINK ASSEMBLY WOMAN INTEREST RATES MIGHT HAVE THE SIX SEVENTEEN COMMUNITY. AS WELL MAYBE SOME OF YOU- AND YOUR DISTRICTS. EIGHTY SIX SEVENTY TO THREE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THERE DISTRICTS WERE CLOSELY WITH THE CONDUCT EXTENSIVE OUTREACH TO LOCAL LEADERS NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO FORM AND MAINTAIN THREE THIRTY COMMITTEES ALSO KNOWN AS CSCS. THE REPRESENTATIVE OF EACH DESIGNATED USE YOUR- THE MONITORING PLANS ALSO KNOWN AS CAMPS. EMISSION REDUCTION. HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE TO BE DEVELOPED FOR PROFIT LED BY THE GSES FOR THE COMMITTEES DURING COMMITTEE. AND THAT IS A COLLABORATION WITH THEIR DISTRICTS. THAT ARE REFLECTIVE OF THE ACTUAL LOCAL AIR QUALITY NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. THE PLAN CONTAINERIZED STRATEGIES. INCLUDING COMMITMENTS TO DEVELOP NEW REGULATIONS. AND SENSE THAT SUCKS BETTER RATED OPTION A CLEANER TECHNOLOGIES. FOCUSED FORTUNATE AND COLLABORATION BETWEEN STAKEHOLDERS AND OTHER AGENCIES. KANSEN COMPASS A WIDE RANGE OF AIR MONITORING PROJECT OKAY NOT A CSC THIRTY COMMITTEES PARTIES A LOCAL ISSUES SUCH AS MOBILE AIR MONITORING AND DEPLOYMENT OF SENSORS AND PORTALS TO PROVIDE NEAR REAL TIME AIR QUALITY INFORMATION. HIGHER FUNDING MUST BE PURSUED EVERY YEAR. AND THE AMOUNT THEIR DISTRICTS HAVE RECEIVED IN THE PAST FOR AB SIX SEVENTEEN OF IMITATION IS NOTABLY LESS THAN THEIR DISTRICTS ACTUAL COST. IN FACT- THE NUMBER OF AB SIX SEVENTEEN COMMITTEES HAS DOUBLED. STATE FUNDING HAS REMAINED FLAT OR DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN OF THE LAST FEW YEARS. IT DECREASED SB SIX SEVENTEEN LONG TERM FOCUS CENTER POLLUTION REDUCTION AND IMPROVED COMMITTEE HELP REQUIRED DEDICATED EQUIPMENT RESOURCES AND STATIC. SB SIX EFFORTS LEAST SIX. THE VISION ONGOING STATE PART IN THIS. UNSERVED UNCERTAINTY SURROUND FUNNY MIX OF TO PLAN AND- THE SEARCHES WERE AS THE CAPITAL INSURANCE THAT NEED. STAFFING THE QUICK. AND RESOURCES IN PLACE NOW WHAT AGAIN THOSE OF THE MONITOR PLAN WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDING THERE DISTRICT STATE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ADD ADDITIONAL DISADVANTAGED COMMITTEES TO THE PROGRAM. INSTEAD OF FUNDING IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND EXPEDITIOUS WAY TO BRING EMISSION REDUCTION THE PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS OF THE DISADVANTAGED AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. ESPECIALLY THOSE BURDENED BY MOBILE SOURCE POLLUTION SECOND HEAVY DUTY DIESEL TRUCKS LOCOMOTIVES AND OTHER EQUIPMENT. HARPAL EMISSIONS CAN CAUSE OR WORSEN HEALTH PROBLEMS INCLUDING ASTHMA ATTACKS HEART DISEASE CERTAIN TYPES OF CANCERS AND PREMATURE DEATH. THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR THE STATEWIDE FUNDING AND FOR IT TO BE ONGOING ANNUALLY. WE ARE SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY ONE FORTY ONE TO PROVIDE THIS VITAL IMPLEMENTATION AND SENATE FUNNY FORTY SIX SEVENTEEN. IF THE PROGRAM IS ALL THE TO BETTER MATCH ACTUAL COSTS. AND HELP MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE TO IMPROVE PUBLIC UP THE DISADVANTAGED UNITS NOT THE STATE. AND I BELIEVE THAT- DEREK BEHALF OF EACH OF THE IT WILL TAKE BUT BUT SINCE. THERE TECHNICAL MATTER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THANK YOU MOULANA BACK CHRISTIAN TORRES. EXACTLY HEARD YES SIR TWO MINUTES.

SEEING NONE CLOSE OUT JUST CLOSE BY SAYING THAT YOU KNOW THE LACK OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING WE'VE HAD COMMUNITIES I DECLINE THE PARTICIPATING IN THIS- ONE OF A KIND PROGRAM D. TO SUMMARIZE THE GOAL OF THE BILL IS TO HAVE A CONTINUOUS SOURCE OF FUNDING SO THAT THESE COMMUNITIES CAN IMPLEMENT THEIR PLANS AND FUTURE COMMUNITIES- CAN BEGIN DEVELOPING- THOSE PLANS- AND BE IMPLEMENTED EFFECTIVELY WE TAKE AWAY FROM THE ANALYSIS THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO. LOOK AT OTHER FUNDING SOURCES THAT WILL ALLOW US TO HAVE A MUCH MORE SUSTAINABLE PROGRAM WE AGREE WITH THAT- ANALYSIS AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE AND OTHERS AS WE MOVE FORWARD I THINK ONE THING WE ALL AGREE ON IS THAT THERE HAS TO BE A FUNDING MECHANISM THAT IS SUSTAINABLE IN ORDER FOR THESE PROGRAMS TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MOTIONS DO PASSED APPROPRIATIONS MAPS ACTIVE LEGAL JERRY THIS FLORA NO THE FLOOR NOPE. BOERNER HORVATH. THREE HUNDRED FIVE. OR HER BY FRIEDMAN. GARCIA MATHIS.

TWENTY THIRTY SIX. I HAVE A DIFFERENT- TWENTY THREE EIGHTY SEVEN YES SIR SORRY BOUT THAT TWENTY THREE EIGHTY SEVEN IS THAT APARTMENT UPON A MEAN TO INVEST SEVEN POINT FOUR THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN ORDER TO RESPOND TO THE WIDE ARRAY OF CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN OUR STATE MANY OF YOU MAY BE WONDERING. WHY IS THERE BOND OF THIS MAGNITUDE IN FRONT OF US GIVEN THE STATE'S SURPLUS AND I WOULD JUST RESPOND BY SAYING THAT YOU KNOW THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS FAR MORE EXPENSIVE THAN SEVEN POINT FOUR. THREE BILLION AND- THIRTY FOUR BILLION OR WHAT THE NUMBER MIGHT BE PROJECTED FOR A SURPLUS. WHAT THIS ALLOWS US TO DO IS TO. HAVE OUR BODY IN THE ASSEMBLY SET SOME PRIORITIES WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE INVESTMENTS. AND HAS- THAT WAS VERY HELPFUL LAST YEAR. IT ALLOWED US TO ENTER INTO BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS TO PRIORITIZE- CERTAIN ITEMS. THAT WE WANT TO PUT FORWARD FIRST. THAT WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING THESE LARGE INVESTMENTS ON THE CLIMATE IMPACTS THAT WERE SEEN. AT THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE. M. WISHFUL THINKING WOULD BE THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO MOVE THIS POLICY. AND THESE INVESTMENTS AND PUT IT BEFORE THE VOTERS BUT WE RECOGNIZE ALSO- THE EIGHT- ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE'RE- FACING. AND THE BUDGET SURPLUS THAT'S BEFORE US SO HOPEFUL THAT. THIS WILL ALLOW US TO INFORM THE BUDGETARY PROCESS IT WILL ALSO ALLOW US TO OR TIES WHAT'S IMPORTANT- TO CALIFORNIANS.

THANK YOU BACK IN HIS CHAIR FOR THE ACCOMMODATION I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY ONE FORTY WHICH SEEKS TO SHUT DOWN THE COSTA ONCE THROUGH COOLING POWER PLANTS- ONCE AND FOR ALL IN A RESPONSIBLE MANNER. THE STATE ADOPTED MORE THAN TEN YEARS AGO THE POLICY TO PHASE OUT THE USE OF THE COASTAL ONCE THROUGH COOLING. NATURAL GAS POWER PLANTS. IN TWENTY TEN THE STATE WATER BOARD ADOPTED A REGULATIONS TO PHASE OUT THE USE OF ONCE THROUGH COOLING- PLANTS HOWEVER WINDOWS TEN YEARS CAME IN TWENTY TWENTY. THE STATE WATER BOARD WORKING WITH OUR POWER AGENCIES THE P. YOU SEE THAT THEIR- CC AND CAL AYE SO. DETERMINED THAT FOR THE SAKE OF GRID RELIABILITY THAT THEY NEEDED TO EXTEND IT FOR AN ADDITIONAL YEAR. WE AGREED TO THAT AT THIS SCHOOL YEAR. ON THE THOMAS THAT THAT WAS IT WAS NOT GOING TO BE EXTENDED ANY FURTHER ONE. THE STATE WATER BARD- IN RESPONSE TO THE- PUBLIC SAFETY OF POWER SHUT OFFS THAT WE EXPERIENCED IN- THAT SUMMER. ONCE AGAIN EXTENDED THE OPERATION OF THE ONCE THROUGH COOLING POWER PLANTS SO WE ARE HERE. TO PRESENT AB TWENTY ONE FORTY. TO ENSURE THAT THERE WILL BE NO FURTHER EXTENSIONS OF THE ONCE THROUGH COOLING POWER PLANTS-IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY WE INCLUDED AN AMENDMENT- IN CONSULTATION WITH THIS COMMITTEE THESE ONCE THROUGH COOLING PLANTS ONLY IF SACRIS THE ADVISORY AGENCY THAT INCLUDES THE CDC THE PC HI SO AND THE STATE WATER BOARD. FINDS THAT NO FURTHER EXTENSION IS GOING TO BE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO ENSURE GRID RELIABILITY. THE PC TESTIFIED IN FRONT OF THIS COMMITTEE THAT THEY DO NOT FORESEE ANY NEED FOR ANY FURTHER EXTENSIONS AND IN FACT THE SACK WAS MARCH TWENTY TWO TWENTY TWO REPORT CONCLUDED THAT CURRENTLY SACK WAS DOES NOT RECOMMEND ANY. CHANGES TO THE COMPLIANCE SCHEDULES INCLUDING THE CURRENT- EXTENSION OF FOR THE AND THE CURRENT DEADLINE FOR THE SHUTTING DOWN OF THE POWER PLANTS BUT WITH ME HERE TODAY IS MAYOR BILL BRAND OF THE CITY OF REDONDO BEACH WHICH IS THE LOCATION OF A ONE OF THE- COASTAL ONCE THROUGH COOLING POWER PLANTS IN OPERATION AFFECTED BY THESE DECISIONS. AND THEN WILL HAVE SEAN BOTHWELL EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE K. CALIFORNIA COAST KEEPERS ALLIANCE- TO ALSO TEST FOR IN SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND GIVEN TWO MINUTES PURPOSE PLEASE. SUBMIT AFTER NOON COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION I FLEW UP HERE FROM REDONDO BEACH THEY'RE WORKING ON THIS FOR FIFTEEN YEARS PRESHOW YOU TAKING YOUR TIME. MY NAME'S BILL BRAND OF THE MAYOR DOWN A BEACH FOR FIVE YEARS WAS COUNCIL MEMBER IN THE DISTRICT FOR EIGHT YEARS PRIOR. I WAS FIRST INVOLVED COMMENTING ON THIS ONCE THROUGH COOLING LEGISLATION WAY BACK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. I USED TO BE A CHEMICAL ENGINEER SOME VERY COMFORTABLE DISCUSSING THESE VARIOUS TECHNOLOGIES. WE'VE HAD A LARGE POWER PLANT OWNER COAST IN REDONDO BEACH FOR OVER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY YEARS. BELIEVE IT OR NOT THIS PARTICULAR PLANT IS NOW ALMOST SEVENTY YEARS OLD. NINETEEN POWER PLANTS RECITED ON THE COAST CALIFORNIA TWENTIETH CENTURY TO USE OCEAN WATER. TO COOL THEIR OPERATIONS CAUSING TREMENDOUS DAMAGE TO THE LOCAL MARINE ENVIRONMENTS. EVERY LIVING ORGANISM THAT JUST SUCKED INTO THESE MASSIVE INTAKES FOURTEEN FEET IN DIAMETER. IN THE CASE OF REDONDO BEACH DIES. PARTICULARLY THE PLANKTON AND OTHER BUILDING BLOCKS OF A HEALTHY MARINE ENVIRONMENT. THEY CANNOT BE SCREENED UP. OUR STATE WATER BOARD PASSED WHAT IS KNOWN AS ONE THROUGH C GULATIONS WAY BACK IN TWENTY TEN TO PHASE OUT THE USE OF OCEAN WATER TO COOL THE PLANTS THEY WORK CLOSELY WITH THE STATE ENERGY AGENCIES AND POWER COMPANIES TO ESTABLISH DATES. WHERE THEY WOULD EITHER RETOOL OR PERMANENT RETIRE WITHOUT THE LIGHTS GOING OUT THE STATE'S WORST AMBUSH TWELVE YEARS AGO. AND THESE DATES WERE EXTENDED FOR FOUR POWER PLANTS BY THREE YEARS AFTER A POWER SHORTAGE BACK IN TWENTY TWENTY. THAT IS SINCE BEEN ADDRESSED. BUT NO ONE CURRENTLY SERVING ON THE WATER BOARD WAS AROUND WHEN THIS LEGISLATION WAS CRAFTED AND IMPLEMENTED SO THEY CONTINUE TO EXTEND THESE DEADLINES AS COMPANIES LIKE. A. S. REDONDO TAKEN FORTY MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR JUST TO BE ON THE READY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THERE ARE CALLED UPON TO OPERATE OR NOT. CITY CURRENTLY LOST A FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR GRANT FROM THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY TO RESTORE THE WETLANDS HERE BECAUSE OF THESE EXTENSIONS. IS LONG ESTABLISHED RETIREMENT DATES HAVE TO MEAN SOMETHING. AND IT'S CLEAR TO ME AFTER ATTENDING EVERY HEARING THAT ONLY LEGISLATIVE ACTION IS GOING TO PREVENT THESE PLANTS. FROM CONTINUING TO OPERATE. LEGISLATION IS WELL THOUGHT OUT IT ALLOWS THESE OLD POWER PLANTS TO CONTINUE OPERATING. IF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY ACCEPTS IT AND SACRIS AGREES. SIR DO TO SUPPORT AB TWENTY ONE FORTY TODAY THE ENERGY AGENCIES AND PARA COMPANIES WILL MEET THE CHALLENGE. BUT ONLY IF YOU PUT A STOP TO THE IDEA OF SIMPLY EXTENDING. THE OPERATION OF SEVENTY YEAR OLD POWER PLANTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR MAYOR GOING TO THE PHONE LINES A MISTER BOTTLE. THANK YOU CHAIRING COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME SEAN BOTTLE IN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT. OF MY RELATION WITH THE LEADING GOVERNMENTAL GROUP TO GO SHOOTING THE ONE WHO CALLED THE- PROMISE THAT A DECADE UP UNTIL. IT WAS ADOPTED IN TWO THOUSAND TEN. THOUSAND OPTION I PERSONALLY BEEN THE MAIN IN IN PROBABLY ONE OF THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT REALLY DIDN'T WATCH **** BILLION HIGHER IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ONE BECOMING POLICY OVER THE LAST TWELVE YEARS. TO ABOUT BACKGROUND I JUST WANTED TO HELP ME BECAUSE KEEPER AND ARE HELPING WATER KEEPERS ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY ONE FORTY- I'M I'M GOING TO JUST BE CLEAR THAT WE DON'T TAKE POSITIONS ON LEGISLATION REGARDING THAT. THAT'S ONE TO COLLECT POLICY VERY LIKELY- GIVEN OUR LONG HISTORY OF COMING TO COMPROMISES WITH THE STATE WATER BOARD ON THE WHAT. WE CALL THE WE DON'T USUALLY TAKE POSITIONS WE DON'T PICK IT IS LAW QUICKLY THAT DIFFER FROM THE INTENT OF THE WHAT THE COOLEY ALL. BUT IN THIS CASE WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION BECAUSE THE INTENT OF THE BILL ALIGNS PERFECTLY WITH THE INTENT OF THE ONE WHO CALLED ME UP. AND I'LL JUST SECOND THE PERSON SPOKE BEFORE THE KNOWLEDGE ON THOSE WATER BOARD HAS CHANGED DRASTICALLY- WHERE WE REALLY DO NEED THIS LEGISLATION. AB TWENTY ONE FORTY IS CRITICAL TO ACHIEVING THE GOAL. OF THE WANT TO COMPULSORY PURCHASE THE PHASE OUT THE DESTRUCTIVE AN AWFULLY PRACTICE OF WITHDRAWING MILLIONS OF GALLONS OF WATER DAILY. KILLING ALL THE MARINE LIFE ALONG WITH IT. WANT TO COULD POSSIBLY MAKE A CLEAR DETERMINATION ALL POWER PLANTS SHOULD HAVE PHASED OUT WHEN THE GOING BY. OCTOBER FIRST TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. AND ALL FUTURE CARPET BUT HAVE A COMMON COMPLAINT BYTHAN ARE REQUIRED TO PAY MITIGATION FEE. BUT THAT APPLICATION FEE OF NOT ACTED AS A DETERRENT FOR POWERPOINT THE COMPLY WITH THE POLICY. OVER THE YEARS WE'VE SEEN DELAY AFTER UNNECESSARY DELAY AND THIS BILL THIS BILL WILL PUT US BACK ON- ATTRACT. ME OUR COMPLIANCE DEADLINES WITHOUT A PULLED WITH WITHHOLDING THE COMMITMENT OF ENSURING WE STILL MEET OUR GRID RELIABILITY. FOR THOSE REASONS I ANSWER I KNOW THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH BRING. BACK THE COMMITTEE ROOM ANYONE ELSE'S SUPPORT. OF AB TWENTY ONE. SEEN NONE. BRING UP THE OPPOSITION. WE A- JOHNSON JONES MR WHY MISTER MEMBERS GOT WET ON BEHALF CAL STATE BY TRADES CAL THE WES STATES OF SHEEP WORKERS CALIFORNIA COALITION TOLD EMPLOYEES STATUS ELECTRICAL WORKERS I ACTUALLY WAS INVOLVED IN NEGOTIATING THE POLICY AT THE STATE WATER BOARD DESPITE WHAT WAS SAID BY THE SUPPORTERS IT WAS NOT LEGISLATION IT WAS REGULATION IT STILL IS REGULATION. WE WERE OBJECTION TO THIS BILL IT'S VERY POORLY WRITTEN PUBLIC POLICY. FIRST AND FOREMOST IT HAS FNDINGS AND DECLARATIONS THAT ARE NOT ACCURATE. AND THAT ARE. THERE TO CREATE- BASICALLY A NARRATIVE. IT SAYS THAT- HATE SPEECH TO THE FACT THAT- THERE WERE. COMMITMENTS MADE AND THAT THEY WERE DEADLINES IN THIS REGULATION. MYTH DOESN'T EXIST. THE POLICY WAS ORIGINALLY ESTABLISHED TO PHASE OUT THE OTC PLANTS VERY CLEARLY IF THE STATE DID NOT NEED THE POWER FOR RELIABILITY. LET ME READ FROM THE POLICY. THE STATE WATER BOARD RECOGNIZES THE COMPLIANCE DATES IN THIS POLICY MAY REQUIRE AMENDMENT BASED ON THE NEED TO MAINTAIN RELIABILITY NO PROMISES NO COMMITMENTS WE NEED TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON. FUNDAMENTALLY WE HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THIS BILL BECAUSE IT INAPPROPRIATELY. AND I WOULD ARGUE POTENTIALLY UNCONSTITUTIONALLY DELEGATES LEGISLATIVE AND ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY TO AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE. AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT DOES NOT EXIST IN STATUTE THE CYCLIST ADVISORY COMMITTEE IS NOT IN STATUTE IT COULD BE IT COULD BE WIPED OUT TOMORROW. IT COULD BE CHANGED IT DOESN'T EXIST IN STATUTE AND SECONDLY. THE PRESIDENT OF DELEGATING TO A LAW TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THE ABILITY TO DETERMINE IF A CITED POWER PLANT SIX CRITICAL TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA KEEPING THE LIGHTS ON SHOULD REMAIN OPEN OR NOT. IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN AN INAPPROPRIATE. IF YOU LOOK AT THE SCOPING PLANS FROM CARB RIGHT NOW WE'RE GONNA NEED THESE OTC PLANS PROBABLY THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY SIX. OKAY WHAT IS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DOING TO MEET OUR POWER DEMANDNEEDS WE ARE BUYING EVERY NATURAL GAS PEAKER PLANT AVAILABLE IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE. WE ARE LOCATING THEM WHERE. NEXT TO LOAD NEXT TO FACTORIES INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES AND WHERE THOSE LOCATED. DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. BUT NO NO NO OF THE WEALTHY WHITE ELITIST COASTAL COMMUNITY COMES FORWARD BECAUSE A POWER PLANT EXISTS THE ONLY OPERATES FOR FIVE DAYS OUT OF THE YEAR AND ONLY DURING PEAK DEMAND. WE WANT TO WE WHAT WE WANT TO SHORT CIRCUIT THE PROCESS UP WE WOULD URGE A NO VOTE OF THE SYSTEM HAS WORKED PERFECTLY FINE THE MAJORITY OF THE O. T. C.'S HAVE BEEN PHASED OUT. WE URGE AND I'VE A NO VOTE I'M VERY FOND OF REDONDO BEACH I MOVED THERE FROM CHICAGO AND I WAS TEN AND- HAVE THE MOVE BACK TO CHICAGO SINCE I DID A COUPLE OF THE POINTS THAT WERE HIT- FIRST OF ALL THE ONES DOLENJE DISHES THAT ARGUMENT ABOUT ONCE YOU COOLEY THAT THAT SHIPS THAT SAILED I GUESS WAS WRONG METAPHOR LONG TIME AGO. MOST OF THE FACILITIES WERE REPOWER- IN IN THE STATE- THERE HAVE THERE ARE STILL SEVERAL THAT HAVE NOT BEEN REPOWERED AND WE'RE SCHEDULED TO BE RETIRED THAT ALL OF THAT IS TRUE THE REASON THEY REMAIN ON OUR LINE IS FOR RELIABILITY REASONS I THINK THERE'S GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THIS AND SO IF IN FACT THE MARCH TWENTIETH- SECOND- DEPARTURE TWENTY TWENTY TO REPORT- THAT MR MERCER G. COMMENTED ON EARLIER IS TRUE. THEN THIS BILL IS NOT NECESSARY BECAUSE THESE PLANS WILL GO OUT- IN THREE YEARS THE PROBLEM IS- THE TWO THINGS ONE WITH THE AMENDED BILL IT TALKS ABOUT THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE TALKING ABOUT STATEWIDE- LOOK MATURITY RELIABILITY- IT IS VERY POTENTIAL- ITS POTENTIAL AND PROBABLY MORE LIKELY THAT WILL BE NEEDED FOR LOCAL RELIABILITY THAT MAY NOT BE THE DOES DECIDE TO RUN TO STATEWIDE ISSUE- AND SO. AT ANY RATE WE ALSO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OF BY WAY OF A RESOLUTION- BECOMING DID THIS POSITIVE OF DECIDED ORDERED CONTINUE OPERATION OF- OF- VARIOUS TYPES OF TECHNOLOGY IN THIS CASE THE ONCE TO COOLING UNITS BUT LOOKING AT THIS ON THE DOWNRANGE TWO SOLAR PLANTS TRANSMISSION THOSE THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. SO IT WE WOULD LIKE TO GET BACK ON TRACK WITH THE GET IT IS FACILITIES REPLACED THERE ARE THE END OF THE AS IT HAS IN ALICE'S POINTS OUT THERE WAS YOU SEE PROCUREMENTS TO REPLACE THESE PLANTS UNFORTUNATELY THEY ARE BEHIND SCHEDULE SO I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE FUTURE OF STYLES I DON'T WANT TO AWARD AWARDED. MORE TALK ABOUT THIS SO I'M YOU KNOW WILL WE'LL SEE WHAT. BUT I WOULD BE VERY. ABOUT TIMES HANDS OF THE STATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM IN OPPOSITION.

THESE BATTERIES THREATEN THE INTEGRITY OF OUR PUBLICLY FUNDED WASTE COLLECTION AND RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE AND THESE FIRES POSE A SAFETY HAZARD% TO OUR WORKERS THIS ISSUE IS COMMON AT MATERIAL RECOVERY FACILITIES ACROSS THE NATION AND THIS IS A CRISIS THAT NEEDS A SOLUTION NOW AS LITHIUM ION BATTERIE ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE COMMON IN EVERYDAY PRODUCTS. AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY IS CRITICAL TO DIVERTING BATTERIES AND PRODUCTS IN THE WASTE STREAM TO PROTECT OUR WORKERS OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND OUR ENVIRONMENT I RESPECTFULLY URGE AND I VOTE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU IS. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- MY NAME IS JASON SMALL TERM HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PRODUCTS GEORGIA COUNCIL ONE OF THE TWO CO SPONSORS OF THE MEASURE I WANNA BE CLEAR FROM THE OUTSET THAT THIS BILL ISN'T ABOUT DEMONIZING ANY SPECIFIC PRODUCT OR PRODUCT CATEGORY- AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY IS SIMPLY A RECOGNITION THAT SOME PRODUCTS HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON THE SAFETY- AND RESILIENCY OF OUR SOLID WASTE AND RECYCLING SYSTEM- AND THE PRODUCER SHOULD SHARE. IN SOME OF THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MITIGATING THOSE IMPACTS- THE BILL REQUIRES PRODUCERS TO OF LOOSE BATTERIES AND BATTERY EMBEDDED PRODUCTS TO ESTABLISH AN EXTENDED PRODUCT THAT PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY PROGRAM FOR THEIR PRODUCTS- PRIOR VERSIONS OF THE BILL HAD LEASED BATTERIES AND BATTERY EMBEDDED PRODUCTS IN THE SAME PROGRAM THIS BILL SEPARATES THEM INTO TWO DISTINCT PROGRAMS- THAT ALLOWS US TO YOU- ESSENTIALLY- CONSTRUCT DIFFERENT PROGRAMMATIC ELEMENTS FOR EACH PRODUCT CATEGORY THAT WORK BEST FOR- THAT PRODUCT IN THE IN THE PRODUCERS- BUT THE STRUCTURE OF TWENTY FOUR FORTY IS PRETTY CONSISTENT- WITH RECENTLY PASSED A RICHER PROGRAMS THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH THIS AND OTHER COMMITTEES. SO THE BILL'S ESSENTIALLY GONNA REQUIRE PRODUCERS TO DESIGN FUND AND IMPLEMENT A TAKE BACK AND RECYCLING PROGRAM THAT'S GOING TO CONTAIN A PLAN APPROVAL PROCESS THAT IT AGAIN IS PRETTY SIMILAR TO WHAT'S BEEN DONE WITH OTHER EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY PROGRAMS- IT HAS CLEAR REQUIREMENTS FOR THE COLLECTION NETWORK IT'S GOTTEN ADVISORY COMMITTEE SO WHETHER STAKEHOLDERS CAN CHIME AND- AND PROVIDE INPUT ON THE PLAN- DOES CREATE AN OBLIGATION ON SOME RETAIL TO TAKE BACK BATTERIES AND SOME- BATTERY AND BETTER PRODUCTS AND IT DOES HAVE STRONG OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS. I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE DIVERSE GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE WORKING CONSTRUCTIVELY- ON THIS BILL- SOLUTIONS ORIENTED I THINK THAT'S THE THEME FOR THE GROUP- ENTIRELY- AND THERE ARE SOME DETAILS LEFT TO BE WORKED OUT BUT I'M CONFIDENT- IN THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER- AND HER LEADERSHIP AND I'M NOT CONFIDENT IN THE GROUP IN THE DISCUSSION THAT WE HAVE GOING AND WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. THE TWENTY FOUR FORTY SIX. ABOUT A MILE AND A HALF OF C. ARE IN OUR IN SUPPORT. LOCAL KOREAN REPRESENT CALIFORNIANS WASTE PROUD CO SPONSOR AND SUPPORT.

JOHN KENNEDY ON BEHALF OF RC RC AND SEE SECOND SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH HE WANTED OPPOSITION IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM OPPOSITION. MISTER MEMBERS FEEL ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION OPPOSE FOR THE REASONS STATED IN OUR LETTER LOOKING FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE OTHER SPONSORS THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE OPPOSITION. SAY NOT ONLY TO THE PHONE LINES AT A MODERATOR ANYONE TO SUPPORT AND OPT FOR OPPOSITION AB. TWENTY FOUR FORTY. YOUR FRIEND SUPPORTER OPPOSITION YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. AGAIN THAT IS ONE AND THEN THEY OFFER ANY SUPPORT THEIR OPPOSITION. WE WILL GO TO THE RIGHT EIGHTY THREE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS PERSONALLY IT ALSO BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL STEWARDSHIP ACTION COUNCIL ALAMEDA STOP WAIT. IN THE WESTERN COSTA RICA MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU AGAIN IT IS ONE AND THEN ZERO FOR IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION. AND WE HAVE NO THERE ARE NO FURTHER SUPPORTER OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THIS IS SORT OF. SO IN THIS BILL AND ENVISIONS THE MANUFACTURERS ARE THE RETAILERS BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR THE- RECYCLING OF THE BATTERIES. HOW DO WE GET CONSUMERS ISN'T THAT'S WHERE THAT'S WHERE THE ISSUE HAPPENS BECAUSE WE BURNED UP I THINK FOR TRASH TRUCKS IN THE LAST. LAST FEW BY A COUPLE MONTHS HERE- PROBABLY FROM THIS WE HAVE PLAYED PLENTY OF PLACES RIGHT NOW- LOWE'S HOME DEPOT EVERYWHERE THEY TAKE BACK BATTERIES BUT WE CAN'T GET PEOPLE. TO TAKE HIM BACK SO HOW DO WE INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE. TO TAKE THESE BATTERIES AND USE THE ONES WE ALREADY HAVE. A CARD THAT WITHOUT TURNING INTO A BECAUSE THE FINES ON HERE HUGE. FOR THE OTHERS AND I AM NOT QUITE SURE HOW THEY GET- WITH THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE WORKING WILL BE FOLDED INTO THIS PROGRAM BUT THE CORNERSTONE OF THAT ANY RECYCLING PROGRAMS EDUCATION AND B. THE PRODUCERS. OF WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT EDUCATION AND WHETHER IT'S- TV OR ON THE INTERNET OR- NOTES WITH YOUR WITH YOUR TRASH. OF IT IS OBVIOUSLY NOT WORKING BECAUSE OF WHAT WHAT WHAT THE PLACES THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE ARE NOT SUFFICIENT DIET WITH. WE KNOW ALMOST- AT LEAST I HAVE A ZIPLOC BAG FILLED WITH BATTERIES AND ALMOST EVERYBODY I KNOW HAS AZIPLOC BAG FILLED WITH BATTERIES IN THEIR DRAWERS AND THEY DON'T REALLY KNOW WHERE TO GET RID OF THOSE BATTERIES SO WHAT WE NEED TO MAKE THESE. PLACES WERE BATTERIES CAN BE RETURNED WERE UBIQUITOUS AND WE NEED TO DO A VERY ROBUST EDUCATION PROGRAM. I'M SURE YOU. KNOW THAT THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I WOULD SAY AS WELL I THINK EDUCATION IS GOING TO BE CORNERSTONE BUT I THINK CONVENIENCE IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THIS PROGRAM AND SOMETHING THAT I THINK THE STATE CURRENTLY LACKS. YEAH THE CONVENIENCE PART OF IT BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE THAT THAT THAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT EVERYBODY HAS WITH ALL OF THIS IS YOU KNOW EVEN RECYCLING IN GENERAL IS IF IT'S TOO DIFFICULT MATT AND THEN WE CAN GET PEOPLE TO DO AND PUNISHING THE COMPANIES DOESN'T NECESSARILY MAKE THOSE PEOPLE DO IT ANY BETTER I DO WANT TO SAY WE ARE WE HAVE HAD EVERY- EVERY PERSON IN THE CONVERSATION WE ARE MAKING SURE THAT EVERY SHAREHOLDER HAS SAY ON HOW WE ARE GOING TO MAKE THIS WORK AND USE YOU DON'T SEE ANY. ROBUST OPPOSITION HERE BECAUSE THEY KNOW WE ARE SOLUTIONS ORIENTED AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS WORKS FOR EVERYBODY RIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MISTER MATHIS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- THE SERVER THANK YOU. THIS IS- THEY ANY BURKE CALLING MR SCHROEDER BRINGS UP A GOOD POINT WHEN IT WHEN IT COMES TO RECYCLING IT IS THE EDUCATION. WHAT IT BOILS DOWN TO IS WHAT IS THE PARTNERSHIP AND WHO PAYS FOR THAT WHO PAYS FOR THE EDUCATION DO YOU HAVE THE STATE TO IT DO YOU HAVE THE COMPANIES DO IT. DO YOU KNOW. DO YOU HAVE A COMBINATION. I THINK YOU'RE TRYING TO BRING EVERYBODY TO THE TABLE YOU'RE TRYING TO WORK THAT OUT WHERE THERE IS GOOD CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY HAPPENING. IN TAKING PLACE- BUT IN A FAIR AND JUST WAY. IN WE HAVE TO FIGURE SOMETHING OUT. IN THIS KIND OF THE BEST THING ON THE TABLE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE CANNOT CONTINUE THE WAY THAT WE ARE GOING- AND SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS ON THIS I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS. THANK YOU MISTER MATHIS. MISTER WOULD YES WELL THANK YOU- MR WENT FO BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD IT'S DESPERATELY NEEDED- I THINK ANYBODY REALLY ANTICIPATED SPECIALLY WITH LITHIUM ION BATTERIES IF THEY BECOME SIGNIFICANT FIRE HAZARD THAT THEY HAVE- SO I DON'T SEE A SOLUTION OTHER THAN RECYCLING THEM AND COLLECTING THEM AND- AND JUST IN GENERAL BATTERIES WHETHER LITHIUM LITHIUM ION OR NOT CREATE A HUGE CHALLENGE FOR US TO FIND A WAY TO GET RID OF THEM OR GET THEM BACK TO SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY CAN BE RECYCLED SO. HAPPENS FOR YOUR BILL TODAY HAVE A TO BE ADDED AS A COOPER THANKS MISTER RIGHT. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE- I CLEARLY NEED TO A BAGGIE OF HATTERAS HEMP SUPER CONVICTED ON THAT RIGHT NOW SO MY BAD- IT IS INTERESTING THAT INITIALLY BILL AND I THINK FOR OUR OUR WASTE HANDLERS IT IS SUPER IMPORTANT I ALSO KNOW YOU'RE VERY. CLOSE WITH THE OPPOSITION WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM SO PLEASE IN CONCORD YOU TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT OFFICE SUPPORTING AS WELL SO WE HAVE A MOTION TO SECOND.

AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTY EIGHT KALRA. IN AB TWENTY TWO EIGHTY SEVEN STOCK. HI SIMONE GARCIA WE'RE GOING TO PRESENT AB TWENTY SIX FORTY NINE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AB TWENTY SIX FORTY NINE ALSO KNOWN AS THE NATURAL CARBON SEQUESTRATION A RESILIENCE ACTIVE TWENTY TWENTY TWO CALLS FOR THE SEQUESTRATION OF SIXTY MILLION METRIC TONS OF CARBON BY TWENTY THIRTY ON NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS. THIS BILL ALSO CALLS FOR AN INCREASE IN SEQUESTRATION TO SEVENTY FIVE MILLION METRIC TONS BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. TO PUT THIS INTO PERSPECTIVE SIXTY MILLION METRIC TONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE IS EQUIVALENT TO THE YEARLY CARBON EMISSIONS ABOUT THIRTEEN MILLION CARS. THIS IS AN AMBITIOUS YET ACHIEVABLE TARGET I CAN TURN CLIMATE GOALS AND THE ENERGY AND TRANSPORTATION SECTOR- AND- IN LINE WITH THE FACT THAT ARE NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS ARE ONE OF THE PILLARS OF THE STATE'S CLIMATE STRATEGY. INVESTING IN PROVEN COST EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS THAT COMPOSTING FOOD WASTE AND A PLANE TO SOIL FOR PLANTING COVER CROPS URBAN TREE PLANTING AND HABITAT RESTORATION FROM CAN HELP CALIFORNIA BECOME A GLOBAL MODEL. IS A WIN WIN FOR NATURAL CARBON SEQUESTRATION. THIS APPROACH IS NOT ONLY SEQUESTER CARBON BUT IMPROVE WATER SECURITY AND RESILIENCE TO DROUGHT REDUCE POLLUTION ENHANCED BY THE VARSITY. AND HELP BOTH RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES ADAPT TO CLIMATE IMPACTS. ACHIEVING THIS GOAL WILL REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INVESTMENT FORWARD THINKING POLICIES TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND COORDINATED ACTION WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON THE GROUND. BUT WE KNOW THAT THE BENEFITS FROM INVESTING CLIMATE SOLUTIONS TODAY FAR OUTWEIGH THE COST OF INACTION DOWN THE ROAD. THE LAST THING I WILL ADD IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF PROPOSALS ON TECHNOLOGY MATT THAT'S REMOVING CARVE AND BETTY ARE UNPROVEN AND COSTLY OFTEN. I AS AN ENERGY INTENSIVE AND YET NOT SCALABLE BUT NATURAL WORKING LANDS NATURAL CARBON SEQUESTRATION IS AFFORDABLE READILY DEPLOYABLE SCALABLE SCALEABLE SCALABLE AND JUST. IT ALSO DELIVERS A BROAD SUITE OF BENEFITS BEYOND CLIMATE WATER SECURITY AIR AND WATER QUALITY WILDFIRE RESILIENCE AND BIODIVERSITY- WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND WITH ME HERE TODAY S. ELLIE COLIN WITH THE CLIMATE CENTER. IN CAMBER FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS. THANK YOU SO MUCH YES SO- GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR RIVAS IS NOT HERE EVERYONE ON THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S ELLIE COHEN CEO OF THE CLIMATE CENTER I'M HONORED TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SIX FORTY NINE WHICH WILL SET IN STATUTE URGENTLY NEEDED STATE GOALS FOR NATURALLY. REMOVING CARBON FROM THE ATMOSPHERE. RECENT U. N. CLIMATE SCIENCE REPORTS ARE CLEAR THE WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY TO SECURE A LIVABLE FUTURE IS QUICKLY CLOSING NO TEMPERATURE RISE IS SAFE FOR THE LATEST SITES UNLESS WE ACT BOLDLY TODAY. CALIFORNIA WILL BE INCREASINGLY DEVASTATED BY GREATER EXTREMES INCLUDING SEVERE HEAT AND DROUGHT THAT ALREADY THREATEN OUR FORESTS AND COMMUNITIES AND WILL THREATEN THE VIABILITY OF MANY OF OUR CROPS AS EARLY AS TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN. WE MUST CUT FOSSIL FUEL USE IN HALF BY TWENTY THIRTY AND BEGIN REMOVING CARBON POLLUTION WE'VE ALREADY PUT IN THE ATMOSPHERE TO HAVE A SHOT AT SECURING A STABLE CLIMATE. TO REMOVE CATHOLIC BUT PASS CARBON POLLUTION THE STATE MUST SCALE UP NATURAL CARBON SEQUESTRATION PRACTICES LIKE COMPOSTING FOOD WASTE AND APPLYING THOSE TO SOILS PLAN COVER CROPS GREENING URBAN AREAS AND RESTORING HABITAT. WIN WIN OUTCOMES WILL INCREASE WATER AND FOOD SECURITY REDUCE POLLUTION AND HEAT IMPACTS PROTECT FARMWORKERS CREATE NEW JOBS AND HELP US ADAPT TO WORSENING CLIMATE IMPACTS. CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE TECHNOLOGY IS SOMETIMES CONFUSED WITH REMOVING CARBON FROM THE ATMOSPHERE. CCS WORKS AT THE SMOKESTACK OR THE POINT SOURCE. IT'S BEEN USED FOR DECADES REPEATEDLY FOUND TO BE INEFFECTIVE EXPENSIVE AND POLLUTING ESPECIALLY TO FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. IT'S ALMOST ALWAYS USED TO PRODUCE MORE FOSSIL FUELS WE ALSO CANNOT RELY ON TECHNOLOGICAL DIRECT AIR CAPTURE WHICH IS STILL IN ITS INFANCY AND NOT YET SCALABLE. ONLY NATURAL CARBON REMOVAL PROVEN ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND AND JUST CAN COST EFFECTIVELY DRAW DOWN PAST CARBON EMISSIONS AT SCALE STARTING THIS DECADE WITH MULTIPLE BENEFITS FOR OUR COMMUNITIES ENVIRONMENT AND ECONOMY. AB TWENTY SIX FORTY NINE IS SUPPORTED BY SIXTY SIX ORGANIZATIONS WE URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON THE NATURAL CARBON SEQUESTRATION AND RESILIENCE ACT AN ESSENTIAL STEP TOWARD SECURING A VIBRANT HEALTHY CLIMATE SAY FUTURE FOR ALL THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. GOING TO THE POLLS WITH KAREN FOR. HI MY NAME IS KAREN BERGER AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF RESEARCH PUBLICATIONS AFFECT.

THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES GREAT CIVIL THIS AFTERNOON AS LEGISLATION- WHO'S PRESENT THIS AFTERNOON ASSEMBLY BILL TWO FOUR FOUR TWO HOW MUCH IS LEGISLATION THAT SEEKS TO CLEARLY DEFINE CLIMATE CHANGE AS A HAZARD UNDER STATE LAW NO ADDED CLIMATE CHANGE TO THE DEFINITION OF DISASTER THE CALIFORNIA DISASTER ASSISTANCE ACT WILL ENABLE US TO BETTER INTEGRATION OF CLIMATE MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION PLANNING AT BOTH THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS. CURRENT LAW IS A CONSISTENT INCONSISTENT AS TO WHETHER CLIMATE CHANGE IS A HAZARD UNTO ITSELF OR SIMPLY A MODIFIER OF EXISTING HAS LIKE A FIRES AND FLOODS YOU KNOW THIS CHANGE WOULD CLARIFY THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS ITSELF A HAZARD. WELL THEY HAD TO FIGHT WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR STATE AND LOCAL TO TAKE A MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH TO REDUCING CLIMATE RISK RATHER THAN TACKLING CLIMATE IMPACTS ONE AT A TIME- THIS APPROACH COULD INCLUDE NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS. SOME SOLUTIONS THAT PROVIDE MULTIPLE ADAPTATION BENEFITS WILL ALSO SEQUESTERING CARBON- THIS LEGISLATION COULD ALSO OPEN UP NEW DISASTER PREPAREDNESS FUNDING THROUGH CAL- YES AND THROUGH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. ULTIMATELY CLIMATE CHANGES MANY IMPACTS OR THE GREAT HAZARD OF OUR TIME AS MANY OF US. I WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE- AND THIS BILL WILL ALLOW STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO INCREASE THEIR CLIMATE RESILIENCE AND A MORE HOLISTIC WAY NOW WITH ME THIS AFTERNOON TESTIFY IS LOOK IT TOOK IS. A FREE REX ON BEHALF OF THE NATURE CONSERVANCY THANK YOU MR. THE REMOTE. THANKS VERY MUCH I MISS CHAIR MATT. LUCAS FOR TIME HAVE THE NATURE CONSERVANCY. AS A OF OUR READ SAID THE AB FORTY TWENTY FOUR FORTY TWO WOULD ELEVATE INCENTIVIZE NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS THAT REDUCE. EMISSIONS AND RISK AND COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR FEDERAL FUNDING TO SUPPORT THESE ACTIVITIES. THAT MANY CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES AND STATE AGENCIES ALREADY RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF INTEGRATING THEIR MITIGATION ADAPTATION EFFORTS- AND WE- THINK THAT THE PROPOSED CHANGE AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY TWO IS IN LINE WITH THIS GROWING TREND. AMONG STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS INCLUDING COUNTY SANTA CRUZ CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO. THAT ALREADY HAVE DONE THIS AND WOULD ENCOURAGE CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE STATE COULD LEAD TO ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND REALLY RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL THANK YOU.

SEQUESTRATION TECHNOLOGIES SO- AS WE DISCUSSED EARLIER- SOME OF YOU MAY RECALL- WHAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE IS- A NUMBER OF INDUSTRIES THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM APPLICATION OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES WE HAVE SOME OF THE BEST GEOLOGY IN THE WORLD- TO STORE PERMANENTLY AND SAFELY- ADMISSIONS- BUT WHAT WE NEED IS A POLICY FRAMEWORK THAT IS GONNA ENABLE THE STATE TO BENEFIT- FROM THE SWEET OF- CCS TECHNOLOGIES- AND BY INCORPORATING- AN EVALUATION OF C. C. U. S. AND TO THE I PAPER. OBVIOUSLY THAT GIVES US AN IMPORTANT TOOL- IN TERMS OF HOW WE'RE PLANNING- FROM AN ENERGY STANDPOINT TO INCORPORATE C. C.

THANK YOU TURN MEMBERS THANK SET THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TO MEASURE AND CONTROL BENZENE EMISSIONS TO ALLOW DISTRICTS TO APPLY MORE STRINGENT TECHNOLOGY STANDARDS. PROVIDED THAT THE DISTRICT REGULATIONS ARE TECHNOLOGICALLY FEASIBLE. BOB. MOBILE FUELING THIS SERVICE THAT IS RAPIDLY EMERGED THROUGH START UPS IN RECENT YEARS AN INDUSTRY THAT STATE AND LOCAL REGULATIONS HAVE. NOT CAUGHT UP WITH YET. CURRENTLY MANY HERE DISTRICTS CHOIRS CERTAIN. PAPER RECOVERY SYSTEM THAT ONLY APPLIES TO CONVENTIONAL GAS STATIONS AND THEREFORE PROHIBITS RETAIL MOBILE FUELING. FURTHER ALSO MOBILE VIEWERS USE CERTIFIED VAPOR RECOVERY SYSTEMS. THERE ARE MANY OTHERS THAT USE STANDARD PICKUP TRUCKS. IN OPERATE ON REGULATED DUE TO ACTIVATED DISTRICT RULES. MOBILE FEELING NUTRIA'S ALREADY EXPANDED. IN AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY THREE INITIATES UP TO DATE LOCAL REGULATIONS FOR THE UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS INDUSTRY CONSISTENT STANDARDS. FOR MOBILE FUELING EQUIPMENT AND ENSURES THAT OPERATIONS MEET OR EXCEED STATE STANDARDS FOR MISSION CONTROL. SPECIFIES THAT AIR DISTRICTS MAY IMPOSE STRICTER STANDARDS ACCORDING TO REGIONALES BY LIMITING THE TOTAL OUTPUT OF FUEL AND RESTRICTING FIELDING LOCATION. AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY THREE DOES NOT APPLY THE AIR DISTRICT THAT ESTABLISH THEIR OWN MOBILE FEELY PERMIT PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE MOBILE FUELING FROM PERMITTING. BEFORE JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY THREE. MANY MEMBERS WILL EXTEND THIS DEADLINE FURTHER TO JANUARY. ONE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. THIS BILL ALLOWS DISTRICTS THE OPTION TO ESTABLISH YOUR OWN EQUIPMENT STANDARDS ACCORDING TO DISTRICTS INTERPRETATION OF BEST AVAILABLE CONTROL TECHNOLOGY. TWENTY FIVE SIXTY THREE HAS SUPPORT FROM THE HYDROGEN COALITION- DISABILITY RIGHTS ADVOCATES AND FIRE SAFETY GROUPS ACROSS THE STATE. WITH ME TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OUR CHAU OAK PARK- FROM POSTER FUELS MISTER HAYES REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA FOUNDATION FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS AND THE COALITION FOR SMART FUELING ON UP LET ME TESTIFY IN SUPPORT APIECE WE CAN MOVE THAT CHAIR WHERE WE NEED TO. RELEASE A- THAT'S ANOTHER. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR FLORA AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JOSEPH A POCKET- AND I AM THE CHIEF POLICY OFFICER FOR BREWSTER A MOBILE ENERGY DELIVERY COMPANY AND A SPONSOR OF THE BILL BEFORE YOU. MOBILE FEELING IS A NEW INDUSTRY THAT WAS BASED ON A SIMPLE IDEA. WHAT IF YOU'LL COULD BE DELIVERED STRAIGHT TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT MOST LIKELY EIGHT MILLION CALIFORNIANS WITH DISABILITIES FOR WHOM ACCESS TO GAS STATIONS IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. WELL THE FEELING IS THE GREENEST WAY TO DELIVER FUEL BECAUSE IT REDUCES SPILLAGE SIGNIFICANTLY. REDUCES VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AND EMISSIONS BY BEING ABLE TO FUEL MORE THAN A HUNDRED VEHICLES WITH JUST ONE TANKER- AND IT REDUCES RELIANCE ON UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANKS AT GAS STATIONS WHICH LEAK INTO THE GROUND. MOBILE ENERGY DELIVERY IS ALSO KEY TO ACCELERATING THE ADOPTION OF ALTERNATIVE FUELS BECAUSE IT DOES NOT RELY ON INFRASTRUCTURAL DEVELOPMENT. FOR EXAMPLE RENEWABLE DIESEL PRODUCES TWO THIRDS FEWER CARBON EMISSIONS THAN REGULAR DIESEL BUT LESS THAN 2% OF GAS STATIONS CURRENTLY OFFERING. MISTERBEGAN OFFERING RENEWABLE DIESEL JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO AND ALREADY WE ARE DELIVERING TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND GALLONS OF RENEWABLE DIESEL PER MONTH. AND THE BAY AREA ALONE HAVING SWITCHED THOSE CLIENTS FROM REGULAR DIESEL TO RENEWABLE DIESEL. THE SAME PROMISE EXISTS WITH OTHER ALTERNATIVE FUELS SUCH AS TV CHARGING AND HYDROGEN WHICH IS WHY THIS BILL HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE CALIFORNIA HUNDRED COALITION IN BRIEF CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL IS ABOUT REGULATING AN ENTIRE INDUSTRY ALMOST ALL AIR DISTRICTS HAVE AN EXEMPTION INTENDED FOR AGRICULTURAL PURPOSES. BUT IS BEING EXPLOITED BY MOBILE FEELERS WHO USE PICKUP TRUCKS TO DELIVER FUEL. THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT RECENTLY FOUND THAT THESE OPERATORS ARE AT LEAST FIFTY TIMES WORSE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT BUT THEY ARE ABLE TO OPERATE FREELY. IN SHORT THE CURRENT REGULATORY FRAMEWORK HAS CREATED A COUNTERINTUITIVE SCENARIO WHERE COMPANIES ARE INCENTIVIZED TO OPERATE IN A LESS SAFE AND FAR MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY HARMFUL MANNER. BECAUSE THEY CAN ESCAPE REGULATION WHEREAS COMPANIES. THAT WORK HARD TO ENSURE THAT MOBILE FEELING IS THAT SAFE AND IS RESPONSIBLE AS POSSIBLE ARE BLOCKED FROM OPERATING. THIS BILL WOULD RAISE THE ENVIRONMENTAL BAR FOR ALL COMPANIES BUT IMPORTANTLY THAT ALSO PRESERVES THE AUTHORITY OF EACH THEIR DISTRICT TO IMPOSE THEIR OWN THROUGHPUT SENSITIVE RECEPTOR AND OTHER CONDITIONS AS THEY SEE FIT. TO ENSURE THAT THEIR DISTRICTS SPECIFIC NEEDS ARE MET. WE THEREFORE RESPECTFULLY URGE THIS COMMITTEE TO APPROVE THE BILL AS THIS BILL WILL IMPROVE AIR QUALITY HELP PAVE THE WAY FOR MOBILE SERVICES TO ACCELERATE ADOPTION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY AND EXPANDED MOBILITY OPTIONS FOR MANY PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND CALIFORNIA WHOSE INDEPENDENCE. IS LIMITED BY SERVICE STATIONS THAT DO NOT CURRENTLY MEET THEIR NEEDS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LISA. THANK YOU VICE CHAIR FLORA AND MEMBERS-OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LISA HAYES I AM A BOARD MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA FOUNDATION OF INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR INDEPENDEN LIVING ROLLING START SERVING THE SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY I AM A DRIVER I'M A LONGTIME RESIDENT OF THE CITY OF BELLFLOWER AND I COMMUTE OVER A HUNDRED MILES DAILY TO WORK. I AM IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY THREE BECAUSE GAS STATIONS JUST DON'T WORK. SINCE THE EIGHT A HALF MILLION PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES IN THIS GREAT STATE WOULD SAY THE SAME. BUT THE SHAMEFUL WALLS OF EXCLUSION FINALLY COME TUMBLING DOWN WERE WORDS GEORGE H. W. BUSH SPOKE AT THE SIGNING OF THE ADA. THESE WORDS ARE ETCHED AND EVERY DISABILITY% ADVOCATES SOUL BUT AFTER THIRTY THREE YEARS WE STILL ARE CHALLENGED WITH ACCESS ISSUES. WE DEAL WITH GRANDFATHER CLAUSES SYMPATHETIC VIEWS ABLEISM OUR UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HASN'T CHANGED AT ALL IN OVER THIRTY YEARS SO WHEN WE SEE A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL OF MAKING SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN OUR LIVES. WE ARE GOING TO SUPPORT IT WE ARE GOING TO BACK AND WE'RE GONNA FIGHT FOR IT. BUT IT IS TRUE. THAT THINGS IN OUR COMMUNITY THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN THE COMMUTER ADVOCATED FOR A BI ARE ADVOCATES ARE ENJOYED BY PEOPLE WITHOUT DISABILITIES THINK OF RAMPS CURB CUTS. TEXTING WAS DEVELOPED BY THE DEAF COMMUNITY AND YOU'RE ALL WELCOME. I DON'T DOUBT MOBILE FEELING WE'LL GET USED BY MANY MORE PEOPLE THAN US BUT THE IMPACT ON US WILL BE PROFOUND. I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO TRAMPLE ON THE ENVIRONMENT SO THAT I CAN FEEL MY CAR. OR I AM ASKING YOU TO EMBRACE THE TECHNOLOGY THAT IS BETTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT WHILE BUILDING A FUTURE THAT IS ACCESSIBLE TO ME. AND TO ALL CALIFORNIANS AND IF I COULD LEAVE YOU WITH JUST ONE FINAL THOUGHT. I READ ONE OF THE COMMITTEE REPORTS THAT SAID THIS IS NOT THE TIME FOR THIS TYPE OF LEGISLATION. THAT IT SENDS A BAD MESSAGE I WANT TO CHALLENGE THAT BECAUSE YOUR SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY THREE WILL NOT ONLY ENSURE RESPONSIBLE MOBILE FUELING. BUT IT WILL SEND THE MESSAGE THAT YOU BELIEVE IN EQUITY AND INCLUSION FOR ALL OF OUR COMMUNITY AND ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT BEEN MARGINALIZED WAY TOO LONG. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MOVING TO ADDITIONAL SUPPORT IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM. AB TWENTY FIVE SIX THREE NAME AN ORGANIZATION PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON DAN- CONFESS WITH THE CALIFORNIA FOUNDATION FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS JENNIFER CUYAMA PART OF THE COALITION FOR CALIFORNIANS ARE SMART FEELING AND I'M ASKING YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME IS CRYSTAL BECAUSE I COULD CLINCH YEAH AND I'M HERE. TO ASK FOR THE SUPPORT AND APPROVAL FOR THIS BILL AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY THREE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IS SUPPORTED COMMITTEE ROOM. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION TO AB. TWENTY FIVE SIXTY THREE. OKAY THANK YOU BYE. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS BRENDAN TO IT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA AIR POLLUTION CONTROL OFFICERS ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING THE THIRTY FIVE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS SMALL THIRTY FIVE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS DEDICATED TO IMPROVING PUBLIC HEALTH AND PROVIDING CLEAN AIR FOR ALL OUR RESIDENTS WE RESPECT FOR RESPECTFULLY IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE MEASURE ABOUT THE CANCR CAUSING TOXIC EMISSIONS AS WELL AS CRITERIA AIR POLLUTANTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE OPERATIONS AND THAT IS WHY INDIVIDUAL DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN THOUGHTFUL. AND MEASURED IN HOW THEY APPROACH THE ISSUE OF ON DEMAND FUELING OPERATIONS TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION LOCAL AIR QUALITY NEEDS AND CONDITIONS. THIS BILL ABANDONS THAT THOUGHTFUL APPROACH BY REQUIRING AIR DISTRICTS TO ESTABLISHING ESTABLISH PERMITTING PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS ACROSS AIR DISTRICTS SPECIFICALLY FOR ON DEMAND TANK VEHICLE OPERATIONS. INCLUDING NEW SOURCE REVIEW STANDARDS THIS ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH IS ACTUALLY COUNTER TO THE CALIFORNIA FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT MANDATES REQUIRING AIR DISTRICTS TO IMPLEMENT PERMITTING AND NEW SOURCE REVIEW RULES THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT LOCAL AND REGIONAL AIR QUALITY NEEDS AND REQUIREMENTS AND WHILE THE RECENTLY AMENDED VERSION INCLUDES A PROVISION. FOR AIR DISTRICTS TO BE ABLE TO COUNT FOR LOCAL AIR QUALITY NEEDS WHEN TAKEN TOGETHER WITH OTHER CON CONTRADICTING REQUIREMENTS THE BILL WILL NOT ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN. SO IN EFFECT UNDER THIS BILL A SMALLER AIR DSTRICT LIKE MODOC WITH A POPULATION OF AROUND TEN THOUSAND WOULD EITHER HAVE TO GO ABOUT THIS THE SAME AS SAN DIEGO OR ALTERNATIVELY SAN DIEGO WOULD HAVE TO GO ABOUT THINGS THE SAME WAY AS MODOC OR- IT WOULD BE SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN. WHICH COULD LOWER PUBLIC HEALTH PROTECTION DEPENDING ON THE AIR DISTRICT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. MEMBERS THE CURRENT STRUCTURE. AND PROCESS IS WORKING AS INTENDED MISTER FIELDS IS OPERATING IN MANY OF CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST AIR DISTRICTS INCLUDING THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT SACRAMENTO BAY AREA SAN DIEGO VENTURA AS WELL AS PLASTER COUNTY COLLECTIVELY THESE AIR DISTRICTS COMPLY COMPRISED CLOSE YET THIS IS THE THIRD YEAR BOOSTER FUELS ONE COMPANY. COMING TO THE LEGISLATURE ASKING FOR SPECIAL TREATMENT AND WE WOULD ENCOURAGE BOOSTER FUELS TO ENGAGE INDIVIDUAL DISTRICTS IN WHICH THEY WANT TO OPERATE INSTEAD OF PURSUING POLICIES THAT ARE DETRIMENTAL TO PUBLIC HEALTH. AND WE RESPECTFULLY- BUT NOT HAVE WITH ME TODAY- TIMELY THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA AIR POLLUTION CONTROL OFFICERS ASSOCIATION TO HELP ANSWER QUESTIONS IF THE NEED ARISES THANK YOU. YES BY ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM. SEEING NONE MATTER MODERATE WILL GO TO SUPPORT OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY THREE.

THANK YOU- FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOUR WITNESS FROM BUILDING STARTS ONE OF OUR STAR. ORGANIZATIONS BACK IN ST BERNARD DINO WE'RE VERY PROUD OF. THE WORK THAT REALLY START BECAUSE- OF IN THE COMMENTS ON THE OPPOSITION THEY TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO PUBLIC HEALTH. I DO SEE THE BENEFIT OF HAVING THIS. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT TWO THINGS- ONE IS. HAVING A LEGISLATION THAT IS FOR THE BENEFIT OF. ONE COMPANY AS OPPOSED TO AN INDUSTRY- MISTER FUELS- THE OTHER IS. THE COMMENT REGARDING THE DEBT THAT THE DETRIMENT TO PUBLIC HEALTH ALTHOUGH I DO NOTE THAT IN THE ANALYSIS IT TALKS ABOUT TO REQUIRING INTERFERENCE TO THE STRICTEST EMISSION CONTROL STANDARDS SO YEAH- THAT'S A LIE. I'M SORRY. BUT LET ME. OR AT THE SOUTH COAST AIR DISTRICT HAS THE BAY AREA EXEMPTS THEM. IF THEY WERE- A PROBLEM WITH PUBLIC HEALTH. THAT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN NEVER AND IN FACT THE DISTRICTS THAT DON'T ALLOW THIS ALLOW THESE ARE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY GALLON- A- PICKUP TRUCKS TO GO AROUND IN FEEL WITH NO ENVIRONMENTAL NO ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERN AT ALL THEY'RE THE ONES YOU'RE POLLUTING. THIS IS A NON BAYERN MENTAL BILL THIS IS GOING TO MAKE THINGS SAFE FOR PEOPLE AND I'M JUST TIRED OF HEARING WHAT YOU JUST SAID BECAUSE IF IT WERE THE CASE AND FURTHER. WE AWHILE IF THEY WANT TO HAVE MORE REGULATION DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY THEY CAN DO IT. AND IT'S NOT JUST FOR ONE COMPANY IT'S FOR ANYONE WHO IS IN THIS BUSINESS SO IT IS FOR THE INDUSTRY. BUT IN ADDITION WHAT IT DOES IS IT CLEANS UP THE ENVIRONMENT BY SAYING YOU EVERYBODY HAS TO HAVE THE SAME SET OF RULES EVERYBODY HAS TO HAVE EMISSIONS CONTROL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MATHIS THANK YOU MISTER CALDERON- MISTER CORE GUY APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- AS MANY OF YOU ALL KNOW MY SON IS IN THE SPINA BIFIDA COMMUNITY- JUST HAVING THE ABILITY FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT DON'T REALIZE THAT THERE'S A LOT. THAT GOES INTO. BEING ABLE TO BE MOBILE BEING ABLE TO BE ACTIVISM WE HEARD IN TESTIMONY TODAY. AND I WANT TO THANK. ALL OF YOU FOR MAKING IT IN. AND TRAVELING BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT. THIS IS NEEDED THIS IS PAST DUE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THIS TYPE OF RESOURCE. JUSTICE SOMETHING SIMPLE THAT WE ALL TAKE FOR GRANTED IS AS SIMPLE AS PUTTING FUEL IN THE VEHICLE. IS A VERY. AND AS WE'VE SEEN PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES CAN BE EXTREMELY PROACTIVE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND IN CIVIC DISCUSSION AS SEEN TODAY IF THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO SO. MISTER CORK I WOULD LOVE TO BE A JOINT AUTHORS ON THIS WITH YOU. WE'LL DISCUSS LATER- CAN CERTAINLY MAKE YOU ACROSS ALL TAKE WHATEVER I CAN GET THIS NEEDS TO MOVE FORWARD THANK YOU CNN DOT ORG THANK YOU FOR BRINGING US FORWARD- HOUSE ECHOING COLLEAGUES COMMENTS IT IS REMARKABLE WHEN YOU THINK OF JUST THE BARRIERS DISASSEMBLES GETTING FUEL CELL- I APPRECIATE YOU BRING THIS FORWARD APPRECIATE THE SPONSORS AND ANDERSTON AIRPORTS CONCERNS AS WELL BUT- I THINK THIS IS NEEDED AND I'M PROUD TO SUPPORT. YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YES WE WE'VE- GONE. OVER BACKWARDS TO GIVE THE LOCAL DISTRICTS MORE AND MORE CONTROL ORIGINALLY. THE STANDARD WAS GOING TO BE SET- AND ESSENTIALLY REGULATION DONE BY THE AIRPORT WE HAVE GIVEN THE LOCAL DISTRICTS. MORE AND MORE CONTROL OF THE PROCESS THERE NOW IN CONTROL OF THE PROCESS. IF THEY DON'T LIKE THE TECHNOLOGY THAT THE AIRPORT IS TALKED ABOUT THEY CAN GO FOR A DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY. AND AGAIN. WHAT THESE DISTRICTS ARE DOING IS ALLOWING POLLUTING VEHICLES. TO GO. UNREGULATED AND AT THE SAME TIME NOT ALLOW A SYSTEM WHICH IS DONE TECHNOLOGICALLY AND IS NOT PRESENT ME HOW ANY HEALTH PROBLEMS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH JUST FROM YOUR TAKEN COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. OH SURE ABSOLUTELY EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AS SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE- WE DO MOST OF THEM I'M OF THE BILL. PER FISCAL MOTION IS PASS AS A MAN TO A- RIVAS. FLORA HI LAURA I BOERNER HORVATH OUR BEST HI AYE FRIEDMAN AYE GARCIA AYE GARCIA AYE MATHIS. MATHIS MURATSUCHI MURATSUCHI I. REYES REYES I SAY ARE TO SAY ARE TO AYE STONE STONE I WOULD. I WAS ABLE TO LEAVE THE ROLE. MANDELSON LEAVE IT OPEN. MISS FRIEDMAN WE'RE READY WHEN YOU ARE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WHICH BILL WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO TAKE UP FIRST. AB TWENTY TWO THIRTY SEVEN OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD AT GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL THEIR HARD WORK AND TIME OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS. THE ATTENDED AB TWENTY TWO THIRTY SEVEN IS TO CLOSE THE GAP BETWEEN STATE CLIMATE EXPECTATIONS AND LOCAL IMPLEMENTATION OF TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS. IN A TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN STUDY CARP CONCLUDED THAT CALIFORNIA IS NOT ON TRACK TO MAKE THE GHG REDUCTIONS EXPECTED UNDER SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE. WHICH WAS THE STATE OF ALL COMMUNITY STRATEGIES LEGISLATION BY STEINBERG. A TWO TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TO REPORT FROM THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL SITES THAT MOST OF METROPOLITAN PLANNING ORGANIZATIONS. NPOS ALLOCATE MORE FUNDS TOWARD ROADWAYS AND FOR TRANSIT. BUT MOST ALLOCATE WERE ROADWAY FUNDING TOWARDS MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS THE NEW FACILITIES. WEIRDED INFLECTION POINT IN TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS MUST BE REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE THE STATE'S CLIMATE GOALS AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL. AB TWENTY TWO THIRTY SEVEN BUILT OFF MULTIPLE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE EIGHTY TO EIGHTY FIVE REPORT THAT STATES A BIG CORPORATES CORRECTION IS WARRANTED. FOR IMPROVING HE CHANCES OF SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE SUCCESS TRANSLATED THAT MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY IF WE EXPECT TO TRULY REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. ONE RECOMMENDATION FROM THE REPORT SAID IT TO FOCUS MPO PLANS ON FUNDING B. AND T. REDUCING PROJECTS. AB TWO G. TWENTY TWO THIRTY SEVEN REQUIRES EVERY USED TO RANK AND PRIORITIZE PROJECTS BASED ON. IT HERE AND SO THE STATE'S CLIMATE GOALS AND SUBMIT THE LIST TO THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. AND THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION FOR REVIEW. RANK PROJECTS WILL NOT INDUCE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. ANOTHER RECOMMENDATION OF THE REPORT SAYS TO ALIGN TRANSPORTATION FUNDING TO SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE. THIS BILL PROHIBITS A REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AGENCY OR COUNTY TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION FROM FUNDING A PROJECT OR PROGRAM. DETERMINED TO BE INCONSISTENT WITH ITS MOST RECENTLY PREPARE TO STABLE COMMUNITY STRATEGIES OR THE STATE'S CLIMATE GOALS. NPOS HERE TO THE STATE'S CLIMATE GOALS SHALL RECEIVE ADDITIONAL FUNDS FROM STE A SURPLUS STATE TRANSPORTATION FUNDS AND FEDERAL FUNDS. ANOTHER THIS BILL CREATES A TASK FORCE OVERSEEN BY THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL INCORRECT IN. CONSULTATION WITH ERA B. H. TO THE IN HOUSE TO REVIEW ALL THE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF NPOS INCLUDING DEFINING WHAT A SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY IS. THE BILL HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR GREATER LYMAN INFORMATION TRANSPARENCY OF TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS FUNDED BY LOCAL TAX MEASURES. REQUIRING EMPLOYERS TO REPORT ON LOCAL TAX MEASURES TO THE CTC WITH MOURNED FOR INFORMATION ON THE FLEXIBILITY IN THE PROJECTS OF WHETHER THEY WILL MEET OUR STATE CLIMATE GOALS. SOME OF THESE LEGACY PROJECTS FUNDED BY LOCAL TAX MEASURES WERE APPROVED BEFORE OUR AB THIRTY TWO GOALS WERE ESTABLISHED MOVING HAVEN'T BEEN REVISITED IN MANY MANY YEARS. I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE AN ONGOING CONVERSATION AS WE TWEAK AND REFINE THE LANGUAGE TO ADDRESS CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION. AND THE IMPLEMENTATION SUGGEST IT'S CONSIDERED IN A CONSIDERED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. OUR INTENT IS NOT TO STOP SAFETY IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS BUT TO RAISE OUR STATE CLIMATE GOALS THE SAME LEVEL OF PRIORITY WHEN IT COMES TO CONSIDERING FUNDING. TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS AT A LOCAL LEVEL CHANGE IS NOT EASY IT'S DIFFICULT BUT WE HAVE TO START SOMEWHERE AND THIS BILL% IS. ONE OF MY HIGHEST PRIORITY BILLS MEANT TO ALIGN OUR STATE TRANSPORTATION POLICIES WITH OUR CLIMATE GOALS TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT THIS AFTERNOON AS ROGER DICKINSON WITH CIVIC WELL AND BILL BOB. MACK MCGOVERN FROM THE COALITION COALITION FROM CLEAN AIR AND I'M SORRY IT'S BEEN A VERY LONG DAY I APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTFUL CONSIDERATION OF THIS. BILL AND REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITH HER FIRST WITNESS IN SUPPORT PLEASE MISTER VICE CHAIR MEMBERS GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M ROGER DICKINSON POLICY DIRECTOR FOR CIVIC WELL FORMERLY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMISSION. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN HAS DESCRIBED THE BILL WELL AND WE THANK HER FOR HER LEADERSHIP. AS SOME OF YOU KNOW I AM ALSO A FORMER SACRAMENTO COUNTY SUPERVISOR AMONG OTHER THINGS. AS A SACRAMENTO SUPERVISOR I WAS THE INSTIGATOR F WHAT BECAME KNOWN AS THE SACRAMENTO AREA COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS OR SAY COG BLUEPRINT. THE BLUEPRINT SERVED AS A TEMPLATE FOR SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE BY THEN SENATOR DARRELL STEINBERG IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB OF DESCRIBING THE BACKGROUND INTENT OF SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE IS A SEMINAL STEPS. TO INTEGRATING LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION. AND REDUCING GHG EMISSIONS. UNFORTUNATELY DUE TOTHE ABSENCE OF A PRACTICAL MEANS OF ENSURING THAT THE ACTIONS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COINCIDE WITH THE SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES STRATEGIES ADOPTED BY NPOS. THE INTENT OF S. B. THREE SEVENTY FIVE TO REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS IT'S FALLING SHORT. AB TWENTY TWO THIRTY SEVEN ADDRESSES THIS FOUNDATIONAL DEFICIENCY BY REQUIRING AMONG OTHER THINGS. ONE AM PO'S TO PRIORITIZE FUND AND IMPLEMENT PROJECTS IN THERE ARE T. P.'S BY- GHG EMISSION REDUCTION BENEFITS TO A. R. B. IN CONSULTATION WITH THE C. T. C. TO REVIEW AND DETERMINE WHETHER PROJECTS IN RTP HE'S- ALIGNED WITH STATE CLIMATE GOALS. THREE FUNDING THOSE PROJECTS THAT ARE CONSISTENT. WITH THE STATE'S CLIMATE GOALS AND NOT FUNDING THOSE PROJECTS WHICH ARE INCONSISTENT FOR. PROJECTS INCLUDED LOCAL TAX MEASURES TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE'S CLIMATE GOALS IN ORDER TO BE FUNDED AND FIVE ADDITIONAL SURPLUS STATE AND FEDERAL TRANSPORTATION FUNDS GO TO M. PO'S THAT APPROVED PROJECTS. THAT IT HERE TO THE STATE'S CLIMATE GOALS. WE ALL KNOW THAT THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IS OUR LARGEST SOURCE OF GHG EMISSIONS IN ORDER TO MEET THE PROMISE OF SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE AND THE CRITICAL CHALLENGE OF REDUCING GHG EMISSIONS FROM TRANSPORTATION. WE MUST ENSURE THAT OUR PRECIOUS TRANSPORTATION FUNDING IS LIMITED TO THOSE PROJECTS TO FULFILL THAT PROMISE AND OVERCOME THAT CHALLENGE. AB TWENTY TWO THIRTY SEVEN WILL DO SO I RESPECTFULLY URGE- I VOTE THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMANMEMBERS BILL MCGOVERN WITH THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR WHEN WE TALK ABOUT REDUCING EMISSIONS FROM TRANSPORTATION WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT A THREE LEGGED STOOL CLEANING UP OUR ENGINES CLEANING UP OUR FUELS WE MADE SOME PROGRESS ON THOSE FRONTS NEED TO DO MORE. BUT THE THIRD AREA WE REALLY HAVEN'T MADE PROGRESS AND THAT'S IN REDUCING THE MILES TRAVELED BY OUR VEHICLES AND THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS SO BADLY NEEDED AND ONE OF OUR BIGGEST OBSTACLES HAS BEENTHAT OUR TRANSPORTATION FUNDING HAS OFTEN BEEN DRIVING EMISSIONS UP. RATHER THAN DOWN AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED THIS BILL TO ALIGN TRANSPORTATION FUNDING WITH THE NEED TO REDUCE THE EMISSIONS THAT ARE MAKING PEOPLE SICK AND KILLING PEOPLE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND ALSO CHANGING THE PLANET'S CLIMATE. AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL AND LET'S REMEMBER THAT IF WE CONTINUE TO VIOLATE NATIONAL AIR QUALITY STANDARDS WE NOT ONLY CONTINUE TO MAKE OUR PEOPLE SICK WE POTENTIALLY JEOPARDIZED FUTURE TRANSPORTATION FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM IN SUPPORT. AB TWENTY TWO THIRTY SEVEN. I'VE GOT MY ON BEHALF OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL ACTION FUND AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. MELISSA ROMERO CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL VOTERS IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU IT WILL ALSO SUPPORT. IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY TWO THIRTY SEVEN PLEASE COME UP. VICE CHAIR MEMBERS I'M PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS THIS BILL I REPRESENT- TRANSPORTATION CALIFORNIA MY NAME IS MARC WATTS AND TRANSPORTATION CALIFORNIA IS A COALITION OF INDUSTRY AND ALLIED LABOR. AND AS THE CHAIR- INDICATED EARLIER ON IN HER CONVERSATION THAT SHE'S BEEN WORKING WITH US AND THEY TRULY HAVE THE SHE AND HER STAFF HAVE HELD SEVERAL MEETINGS WITH US AS WE WENT THROUGH THE BILL LINE BY LINE AND- THREE EACH AMENDMENT. ESSENTIALLY WE OPPOSE IT READ AT THIS POINT TIME BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S OVERLY PRESCRIPTIVE- BECAUSE WHILE THE CITY CONTINUES TO HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY. FOR DEVELOPING GUIDELINES FOR EACH OF THE SES'S THE BILL NOW BRINGS IN. A RB AND OPR TOOK TO IT AFTER THE FACT REVIEW OF WHAT THE PRODUCT WAS AND SO IT'S HARD TO PUT TOGETHER A PROGRAM THAT ANTICIPATES. OF THE SECONDARY VIEW- THE R. T. P. A. AND IMPERIAL ROLE HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO BALANCE MOBILITY NEEDS. WITH CONSTRUCTION FUNDING. AND OVERALL EACH SCS IS TO HAVE A NET NEGATIVE GHG REDUCTION- DOESN'T SAY UNTIL NOW SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE EVERY PROJECT- MEET PM TEAR G. ISSUE. SO THAT A MAJOR CHANGE COULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES ESPECIALLY WITH THE SELF HELP COUNTY. EXPENDITURE PLANS THAT ARE ON THE BOOKS AT THIS POINT IN TIME AS THE CHAIR OF THE TUNE REPORT WORK ON LANGUAGE ON THAT- FINALLY- AS I WAS JUST DISCUSSING THE SUFFOLK COUNTY. THE LATEST MEMBERS TO NOT SINK THE PRIOR A REQUIREMENT THERE ARE TWO PA'S. MAY NOT FUND. PROJECTS JUST TO BE OUT OF SYNC WITH THE YES YES. IT DOES THEN SEVEN CONTINUES THAT MANDATE WHETHER OR NOT WE'VE GOT THE NEW SET OF- GUIDELINES AND RULES SO WITH THAT.

I APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS TO TRY TO GET PEOPLE AWAY FROM TRAVELING ON ON ROADS BUT- IN AREAS WHERE YOU HAVE ROADS ALREADY KNEW HAD THEM FOR A LONG TIME THAT'S GREAT FOR AREAS THAT ARE BEING PRESSURED TO BUILD MORE HOUSES SO THAT WE CAN- SUPPORT- THE PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE HOUSES RIGHT NOW AND TRY TO REGAIN OUR BALANCE IN HOUSING. WE DON'T HAVE ROADS OUT THERE WE DON'T HAVE ROADS IN AND RIVERSIDE AND SAN BERNARDINO COUNTIES- IT N. WE ARE DESPERATE TO COMPLETE SOME OF THE ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE SO PEOPLE CAN GET AROUND OUT THERE- DURING THE SUMMER TIMES IT IS HOT. THERE IS NO THERE'S NO BIKING THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO GET PEOPLE TO JOBS THAT DON'T EXIST YET- BECAUSE- IN ORDER FOR JOBS DO EXIST WE HAVE TO HAVE TO COMPANIES COME IN AND THEY HAVE TO HAVE ROADS TO GET TO THEIR COMPANIES. WE CAN GET PEOPLE FROM COMMUTING SIXTY MILES IF WE CAN FOCUS ON THAT. BUT DID TO DRAW TAKE MONEY AWAY FROM ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE- DOESN'T SUIT A LOT OF PLACES IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE THE- POTENTIAL TO GROW MORE. AND ACCEPT THE HOUSING IN THE BUILDING THAT NEEDS TO OCCUR TO ACCOMMODATE OUR HOUSING NEEDS. AND AND THIS I DON'T SEE THIS HELPING US. SO FOR THOSE REASONS I'M GONNA HAVE TO OPPOSE BILL TODAY THINK. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE. SAM NUNN THREE ONE JULY TO CLOSE SURE- CERTAINLY I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS THAT ERE RAISED- WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION- TO CLARIFY THE BILL WE'VE COME QUITE A LONG WAY THE BILL CERTAINLY IS NOT GOING TO PROHIBIT THE BUILDING OF ROADS IN CALIFORNIA BUT IT DOES SEEK TO. HELP TO PRIORITIZE PROJECTS THAT ARE ON THE BOOKS SINCE ADMITTED THAT ARE TRANSIT PROJECTS PRIMARILY TO MOVE SO THAT WE DO. ADEQUATELY FUND ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE DONE IF YOU LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT GOES INTO A TRANCE IN CALIFORNIA EVEN COMPARED TO SOME OF THE OTHER STATES YOU'LL SEE THAT WERE REALLY WOEFULLY BEHIND IN FUNDING OF PROJECTS THAT PROVIDE. SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS AS WELL AS EQUITY IN WAYS FOR PEOPLE TO GET AROUND IF THEY CAN'T AFFORD OR CHOOSE TO NOT HAVE A CAR AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL INTENDS TO DO AND I WOULD APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE WORKING ON IT THANK YOU SO MUCH.

LARGE SCALE THAT STATION MANAGEMENT SOME OF THE COMMONLY USED TECHNIQUES CAN SPREAD INVASIVE PLANTS CAN DAMAGE NATIVE VEGETATION WHICH CAN ULTIMATELY LEAD TO DENTAL VEGETATION AND HEIGHTENED FIRE RISK AND ALSO INCREASE STRAP ON OUR WILDLIFE AND REDUCE OUR CLIMATE RESILIENT.

THINK OF THEM AS- BATTERIES ON WHEELS. AND WITH THE STATE STREET AND ADOPTION OF THE ADVANCED CLEAN TRUCK RULE ON THE PENDING CONSIDERATION OF THE AIRPLANE FLEET RULE. THIS IS. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR STATE TED DECARBONISE ANOTHER MAJOR PORTION OF THE ECONOMY. ANYTHING FUNDS FROM THIS PROGRAM TO HELP UNLOCK BY CHARGING AT THE THEIR EMISSION VEHICLES COULD BE TRANSFORMATIONAL BECAUSE WILL HELP REDUCE LOCAL AIR POLLUTION AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. FOR THESE REASONS I ENCOURAGE HER AYE THAT THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU AND REBEKAH LEE. NUMBER REBECCA LEE ON BEHALF OF AN RG AT A DISTRIBUTOR ENERGY PROVIDER AS WELL AS THE DIRAC. WITH THE BITER AND CALIFORNIA WEEK THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN FOR THE MEASURE. THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW WEEK HEALTH PROVIDERS TO BETTER CUSTOMIZE DISTRIBUTED ENERGY SOLUTIONS TO UNWIND BALLADEERS TO THE CUSTOMER WHAT THEY NEED TO QUIT. FOR EXAMPLE BY HELPING OUR CUSTOMERS COMBINED ONE OR MORE. OF IT SHOULD BE TO ENERGY WE CAN AGGREGATE THAT DEMAND REDUCTION ACROSS MULTIPLE CUSTOMERS. TO PROVIDE A CRITICAL RESOURCE TO THE GRID THEREBY REDUCING THE NEED TO RELY ON ADDITIONAL FOB SO GENERATIONS THAT BATCH. UNDERSTANDABLY CUSTOMERS IN DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE STATE. WITH DIFFERENT ECONOMIC NEEDS HAVE DIFFERENT ENERGY DEMAND PROFILES BY PROVIDING CUSTOMER CHOICE IN CLEAN ENERGY SOLUTIONS WILL HELP INCREASE EQUITY IN OUR CLEAN ENERGY EFFORTS BY ENABLING EACH CUSTOMER TO MAKE IT SUCH A GOOD ENERGY.

RIGHT FRIEDMAN AYE GARCIA AYE GARCIA AYE MATHIS THOUGH MATHIS NUMBER TWO G. MURATSUCHI I. REYES. SEYARTO NUMBER. STONE STONE WOULD WOOD I. THE BILL HAS SIX WAS LEAVE IT OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS OUT ON. WE'LL GET THIS MEMBER TEAM WHICH BILL WOULD YOU LIKE 2% FOR SIR. AB. TWENTY SIX FIFTY SIX FIVE AB TWENTY SIX ANSWER YOUR- BILL. THANK YOU- AB TWENTY SIX FIFTY SIX EXPAND OR JUST ENSURE THAT WE CLARIFY THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT WHICH WAS PASSED INTO LAW IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO TO LIMIT THE ABILITY OF LOCAL AGENCIES TO DENY QUALIFYING. HOUSING PROJECTS FROM BEING BUILT IN THEIR JURISDICTIONS. WHAT THIS DOES IS AB TWENTY SIX FIFTY SIX CLARIFIES. AROUND THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY OU THAT IF IT LOCAL JURISDICTION IS GOING TO ASK FOR FURTHER ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW THEY HAVE TO. BE ABLE TO THEY CAN ONLY ASK WHAT SEE WHAT ACTUALLY. REQUIRES OR HAS THE ATTRIBUTES UNDER SEQUEL ALSO IF A PROJECT IS. DECLARED EXEMPT UNDER SEEK WITH A DEAF PRACTICAL DREAMS ACT- THERE IS NO EXPANSION OF SEQUEL- THERE IS NO TOUCHING OF SYKORA. IN THE LEGISLATION THIS BILL COMES ABOUT BECAUSE WE HAD TWO INSTANCES IN MY DISTRICT OF SAN FRANCISCO WHERE WE HAD UNFORTUNATELY- PROJECTS THAT HAD GONE THROUGH. THE ENTIRE SUPER PROCESS BUT OF COURSE THEY WERE DENIED WITHOUT ANY FURTHER CLARIFICATION OR WITHOUT ANY PARTICULAR REMEDY I HAVE A MICHAEL LANE HERE FROM SPUR AND CORNELIUS- BURKE FROM CBI. THE TEAM IS FOR WITH US MISTER MISTER MEMBERS MY- FOR PUBLIC THINK IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. AB TWENTY SIX FIFTY SIX DOES NOT TOUCH THE GUN ANYWAY NOR DOES IT ALTER ANY EXISTING RIGHTS OR RESPONSIBILITIES THAT EXIST IN CURRENT LAW WITH REGARD TO THAT STATUTE. THIS BILL IN NO WAY ELIMINATES OR LIMITS LAWFUL AND LEGITIMATE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW NOR DOES IT CHANGE THE QUICK TIME LINES OR TRUNCATE THE PROCESS. FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS WERE RECENTLY ADMITTED IN THE BILL TO EXPLICITLY CONVEYED ITS INTENT TO CLARIFY EXISTING LAW AND CODIFY EIGHT CITIES INTERPRETATION OF THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT. IT'S INTERACTION WITH SEQUEL. THE BILL DOES NOT EXPAND THE DEFINITION DISAPPROVAL UNDER THE HIPAA WHICH BOTH THE LEGISLATURE IS FOUND AND COURTS HAVE RECOGNIZED ALREADY BROADLY INCLUDES ANY REQUIRED LAND USE APPROVALS OR ENTITLEMENTS NECESSARY FOR THE ISSUANCE OF BUILDING A BUILDING PERMIT. WELL THE HA DOES NOT EXEMPT PROJECTS FROM SEEK WHAT IT ALSO DOES NOT AUTHORIZE CITIES TO DEVISE A QUICKLY EARNS TO WHICH A HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IS LEGALLY ENTITLED. AB TWENTY SIX FIFTY SIX REALLY REQUIRES A SEQUENCE OPTION ALREADY ON THE BOOKS. THAT A HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS LEGALLY ENTITLED TO BASED ON THE RECORD BEFORE THE AGENCY BE GRANTED. MORE THAN A I. R. OR NECK DECK WITH A LEGALLY SUFFICIENT BASIS IN THE RECORD. BE ADOPTED. THIS IN NO WAY PRECLUDES ADDITIONAL STUDY IF THE NEED IS IDENTIFIED. THE FACT IS AB TWENTY SIX FIFTY SIX ONLY SIX TO ENFORCE THE LAWS AROUND ENVIRONMENT REVIEW. THAT ARE ALREADY IN STATUTE AND WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AND I BOTH. THE VERY MUCH CHRIS. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CORNELIUS BURKE WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. WE ARE THE HOMEBUILDING INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA- WE ARE PROUD TO SUPPORT AB TWENTY SIXTY SIX BY. ASSEMBLYMEMBER TING. IN FACT WE HAVE DOESN'T IT THIS BILL IS A HOUSING CREATOR. FOR TWENTY TWENTY TWO BECAUSE IT REDUCES THE BARRIERS. TO HOUSING PRODUCTION AND EFFORT TO ALLEVIATE OUR STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS. AB TWENTY SIX FIFTY SIX SIMPLY CLOSE A LOOPHOLE AND THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT. BRIEFLY CREATED BY SOME TO ADD ADDITIONAL STEPS TO CALIFORNIA'S ALREADY LENGTHY AND COMPLICATED. HOUSING APPROVAL PROCESS. WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT YOU VOTE FOR. AB TWENTY SIX FIFTY SIX BECAUSE OF THE HOUSING CREATOR. AND IT WILL HELP IN OUR HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR STATE THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. OF AB. TWENTY SIX FIFTY SIX. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS ADRIN MUHAMMAD WITH THE HABITAT FOR HUMANITY FOR CALIFORNIA SAND HILL PROPERTY COMPANY AND CIVIC WHILE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT OF COMMITTEE ROOMS. C. NONE THE OPPOSITION AB TWENTY SIX FIFTY SIX IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM. GOOD EVENING I CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS TANYA GLOUCESTER IN HERE ON BEHALF OF STATE BUILDING A CONTRACT CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWO SIX FIVE SIX THE BILL WILL REDEFINE- LAND USE LAWS IN CALIFORNIA BY CREATING A NEW DEFINITION OF PROJECT DISAPPROVAL THAT INCLUDES. SOME POINT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS IT PROHIBITS AGENCY DECISION MAKERS FROM COMPLYING WITH THEIR STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS TO CONDUCT ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH REVIEW WHEN THEY REASONABLY BELIEVE BASED ON THE EVIDENCE IN THE RECORD THAT A PROJECT IS NOT EXEMPT FROM SEA QUEST OR HAS NOT MET THE LEGAL OBLIGATION TO MITIGATE OUR PROJECTS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. ALLOWING A DISCUSSION ABOUT ELIGIBILITY OF AN EXEMPTION OR THAT FURTHER ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW IS REQUIRED TO BE A BASIS FOR LITIGATION IN THE MIDDLE OF A SECRET PROCESS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE DETERMINING WHETHER A PROJECT IS EXEMPT IS A DISCRETIONARY DECISION MAKING PROCESS. FOR EXAMPLE ALL CATEGORICAL EXEMPTIONS OF CLASSES ONE THREE THIRTY THREE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENT EXCEPTIONS IN THE SEQUEL GUIDELINES EVEN OF A PROJECT IS SPATIALLY ELIGIBLE FOR SICK BUT- EXEMPTION NO CATEGORICAL EXEMPTION CAN BE USED IF FOR EXAMPLE THE PROJECT IS ON A THIRTIES THE LAST OR IT'S IN A NIGHT. OF PARTICULAR LOCATION OR THEIR CUMULATIVE IMPACTS OR UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES THIS IS THE DELIBERATION THAT GOES ON BEFORE A LOCAL AGENCY WHETHER AN EXCEPTION TO AN EXEMPTION APPLIES AS A FACT BASED DECISION- THAT MUST BE MADE BASED ON EVIDENCE IN THE RECORD SIMILARLY A DECISION ABOUT WHETHER WE'RE PROJECT REQUIRES FURTHER ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW IS PART OF THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS. I'M FOR EXAMPLE A PRIOR SUPER REVIEW COULD BE DONE THEN WE HAVE A RESIDENTIAL PROJECT COME INTO THE AREA PERHAPS THE FOOTPRINT CHANGES ARE THE PROJECT GETS BETTER BAKER THE AGENCY HAS THE DUTY UNDER SEA QUEST. TO GO AND DO FURTHER ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW TO REQUIREMENTS. MEASURES BEFORE IT APPROVES THAT PROJECT THIS BILL WOULD CUT THAT PROCESS SHORT AND WOULD HAVE IMPROPERLY PLACES THE DECISION MAKING POCESS IN THE HANDS OF THE COURT'S. DENIAL OF SECRET CLEARANCE IS PRECISELY NOT ENCOMPASSED WITHIN THE HHS DEFINITION OF DISAPPROVAL IN FACT THE HA A SAYS EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE. NOTHING SHALL. AFFECT COMPLIANCE WITH SEPA. THERE IS NO- INCONSISTENCY SEQUEL REQUIRES FINDINGS BE MADE UNDER THAT STATUTE AND THE HA A REQUIRES FINDINGS TO ME MADE. UNDER THAT STATUTE THIS BILL WOULD BE INCONSISTENT WITH BOTH OF THE STATUTES. FINALLY AB TWO SIX FIVE SIX IS A VIOLATES THE BASIC ADMINISTRATIVE EXHAUSTION PRINCIPLES ARE ALLOWING THE LAWSUIT TO CHALLENGE THE NILE OF A PROJECT BY AN AGENCY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PROCESS WITHOUT FIRST REQUIRING- CHALLENGER WHO DEVELOPER. TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF THE PROCESS OF EXHAUSTING ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES EVEN THOUGH THE SECRET PROCESS REQUIRES CITIZEN GROUPS TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF APPEALING AN AGENCY DECISION A PLANNING COMMISSION DECISION TO THE NEXT APPELLATE DECISION MAKING BODY- IT EXHAUSTED. IT VIOLATES THE EXHAUSTION REQUIREMENTS UNDER LOCAL PROCEDURES UNDER MUNICIPAL CODE OR COUNTY'S ORDINANCE AND ALSO VIOLATES THE EXHAUSTION PRINCIPLES IN SEA QUEST. THIS SEQUEL ALLOWS APPEALS OF AN E. I. ARE MITIGATED NIGHT AFTER NIGHT BACK. TO THE ELECTED DECISION MAKING BODY. I'M IT IS ALSO IN CA WITH THE CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE BOTH TEN EIGHTY FIVE AND TEN NINETY FOUR POINT FIVE WHICH ARE THE METHODS FOR BRINGING LAND USE APPROVALS- CHALLENGES UNDER SECRET UNDER STATE LAW.

NOW WITH THAT- WE HAVE NO FURTHER OPPOSITION OR SUPPORT IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH BRING THAT TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THIS RACE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. BUT OF ALL THE BILLS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT TODAY THIS IS THE ONE THAT CAUSED ME THE MOST CONSTERNATION- HI. RIGHT THE AUTHOR HOWEVER MAKES THE DIFFERENCE HERE- I THINK THAT HAVING THE BUILDING TRADES IN OPPOSITION I KNOW IT'S SOMETHING THAT I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING ON. BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE WORK THAT WE DO A SPECIAL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ABOUT HOUSING- THE- FOR TODAY I WILL GIVE A COURTESY AYE VOTE. AND I'D I KNOW THAT THE ANALYSIS THAT WAS PREPARED GIVEN NUMBER OF ITEMS THAT NEEDED TO BE ADDRESSED AND I KNOW THAT THOSE WILL BE ADDRESSED AND- I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THAT BUT- WITH THAT I WOULD MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT. YES MISTER KING I YOU KNOW I FEEL LIKE AND I LISTEN AS I LISTEN TO THE OPPOSITION AND SUPPORT HERE IT AND IT IT DOES FEEL LIKE THERE IS THERE IS A WAY TO GET THIS DONE GET WHAT YOU NEED TO GET DONE AND- I'M SORRY THAT THAT THAT HASN'T HAPPENED TO THIS POINT BUT I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A COURTESY AYE VOTE TO MOVE THIS ALONG TO GIVE YOU THAT OPPORTUNITY. GREAT THANK YOU. IN AN OBSOLETE WILL WILL CONTINUE AFTER DISCUSSIONS- WITH THE OPPOSITION TO ADDRESS THEIR ISSUES. AS WELL AS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE ADDRESSING THE VALASSIS AND WE ABSOLUTELY I WILL CONTINUE TO. CONTINUE TO WORK ON HOPES OF REACHING RIVER FOR WHICH A FLOOR. FIFTEEN CAN I JUST TELL HARPER ONE COMMENT I THINK WE ACTUALLY- CLOSER THAN IT APPEARED FROM OUR COMMENTS I THINK BECAUSE WE WANT TO EXHAUST. THE LOCAL REMEDIES TO AND GO THROUGH THE ENTIRE PROCESS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL UNDER SEQUEL- BEFORE THAT THIS WOULD EVEN- TAKE PLACE THAT THE ACTION THAT WE HAVE HERE IN THE HA. AND FOR EXAMPLE IF IT'S ON A CORTES OF THIS THAT'S WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW THAT. YOU CAN'T HAVE AN EXEMPTION WAS GONNA LITIGATE THAT FOR EXAMPLE SO I THINK THERE IS. THE POTENTIAL FOR MANY OF THE MINES HERE. MISTER SEG. I'M SORRY. THAT COMMENT- THE FACT THAT THERE WOULD BE A COURT DECISION IN THE MIDDLE OF SICK BOY IS OF GREAT CONCERN TO ME- SO THAT IN ADDITION TO THE FACT THAT WE HAVE THAT THE OPPOSITION IT WAS STATED SO. GOING BACK TO THE ANALYSIS WHICH I FELT PROVIDED A NUMBER OF ITEMS THAT THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED I THINK THAT AGAIN I AM CERTAIN THAT THIS WOULD BE ADDRESSED- THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR MESSAGE. THANK YOU SO- I KNOW- VISITING UNITED TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE AND I. AND TRYING TO RECONCILE WHAT YOU WERE- EXPLAINING THE BILL WITH THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS I MEAN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AS WELL REPRESENTATIVE. SEEMS TO CLEARLY STATE LIKE I'M I'M READING FROM THE COMMITTEE NOW SAYS HERE THIS BILL WILL ALLOW A LAWSUIT BASED ON AN INTERIM DECISION BEFORE THE RECORD IS COMPLETE BEFORE ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES ARE EXHAUSTED- AND BEFORE THE PROJECT HAS BEEN APPROVED OR DENIED I DON'T SEE HOW THAT IS NOT. IMPACTING SEQUEL. SO WE WANT TO GET TO CLARIFY THE LANGUAGE THAT. THE DEMONSTRATORS THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN YOU WOULD NOT HAVE LITIGATION IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PROCESS OF UP BY THIRTY DAYS A JURISDICTION THIS IS A FINE WHAT LEVEL OF ENVIRONMENT REVIEW NEEDS TO BE DONE SIXTY DAYS FOR NEGATIVE DECLARATION AND THE YOUR FOR A FULL BLOWN. HE I ARE WE DON'T WANT TO TOUCH THOSE TIME LINES AND AT THAT POINT OF THE DILATORY TACTICS AND YOU JUST GOT SOMEONE ON A FISHING EXPEDITION. FROM A THEIR SAME RELIGIOUS TO STUDY THIS FOR THAT WITHOUT ANYTHING IN THE RECORD TO INDICATING THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL STUDY THAT'S WHEN YOU WOULD WANT TO BRING IN THIS PROCESS AT AFTER ALL THAT LEVELS OF THE REMEDIES HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED THAT'S WHERE WE NEED TO GET WITH THE LANGUAGE AND GLAD TO WORK WITH WITH THIS COMMITTEE- GOING FORWARD AND THE TRADE TO GET TO THE LANGUAGE THAT WORKS FOR ALL PARTIES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. HI THIS IS A WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE PLEASE. AND YET AGAIN BUT REALLY PROJECT THE DISCUSSION- YOU KNOW I. I DO THINK IN OUR TERMS OF OUR READING OF THAT WITHOUT THE SERVICES WE DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT IT DOES BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM. A CLARIFYING LANGUAGE TO ENSURE THAT DATA SAID CRYSTAL CLEAR SO WITHOUT RESPECT FOR US FOR ABOUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT IS A GOOD. HELLO ALL SECOND THE BILL MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS RIVAS FLORA HI LAURA I BOERNER HORVATH. BOERNER HORVATH NO FRIEDMAN HI FRIEDMAN AYE GARCIA. LOADING MATHIS MATHIS AYE MURATSUCHI RIGHT TO CHEER I REYES. REYES I SAY ARE TOO HIGH C. R. TO AYE STONE. STONE NO WOULD. WOOD HI. THE BILL SERVER TO TELL THANK YOU RIGHT NOW IT MOVING ON THE AB TWENTY EIGHT SIXTEEN YES SO LET ME- JUST START BY SAYING THAT WE ABSOLUTELY ACCEPT THE- COMMITTED WOMEN'S TENNIS AND THANK THE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL. THE BILL REQUIRES THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO REDESIGN ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE INCENTIVES- WE'VE MADE GREAT PROGRESS AND- INCENTIVIZING ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES BOTH NEW VEHICLES AS WELL AS USED VEHICLES- BUT AT A TIME. WITH BUSH WITH THE NEWER VEHICLES WE'VE SEEN WE NEED TO MAKE A CHANGE TO REALLY GO AFTER THOSE DRIVERS WHO USE THE MOST GASOLINE AND WITH THAT- WE ARE ASKING THEIR THEIR RESOURCES BOARD TO REDESIGN THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM SO THAT THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPER USERS OF GASOLINE HAVING THE LONGEST COMMUTES WE OFTEN HAVE MANY COMMUTERS THE CENTRAL VALLEY GOING INTO THE BAY AREA- THOSE INDIVIDUALS WOULD RECEIVE THE HIGHEST INCENTIVE BECAUSE WE REALLY WANT TO FIND IN THE SENATE THAT WOULD GET THEM OUT OF THEIR GASOLINE CAR INTO A CLEAN CAR- WE THINK THAT NOW IS THE TIME TO REALLY LOOK AT THAT READ REDESIGNING WE'VE MADE HUGE AMOUNT OF SUCCESS. I GOT A LOT OF FOLKS MOVING MOVED INTO- ELECTRIC CARS AND CLEAN VEHICLES- AND WE THINK THAT WITH THE PROPER INCENTIVES WE CAN REALLY MOVE ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO USE THEIR VEHICLES A MOUSE INTO A CLEAN VEHICLES WITHOUT- HAVE JANELLE LONDON HERE FROM- CULTURE. GO GIVE A FEW REMARKS AS AS WELL AS FAR IVANKA. RENDON ON THE PHONE. START WITH JANELLE HEARING COMMITTEE ROOM. YES I AM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE I'M JANELLE LONDON WITH THE NONPROFIT CULTURAL WORKING TO MOVE BEYOND GASOLINE. AND THERE'S REALLY THREE FACTORS AT PLAY- CREATING THE NEED FOR THIS BILL FIRST IS THE LOWEST INCOME DRIVERS WHO ARE BURNING THE MOST GASOLINE ARE SPENDING UPWARDS OF THEIR VEHICLE FUEL- AND THEN SECOND- WE'VE GOT A CLIMATE CRISIS. BURNING GASOLINE AND LIGHT DUTY CARS AND TRUCKS AS THE SINGLE BIGGEST SOURCE OF CARBON EMISSIONS AND CURRENT ZAB INCENTIVES HAVE NOT BROUGHT OUR GASOLINE CONSUMPTION DOWN WE'VE STAYED AT FIFTEEN BILLION GALLONS A YEAR. IN CALIFORNIA FOR THE LAST DECADE- AND THEN FINALLY WE REACHED A POINT WHERE OTHERS HAVE MARKET IS NO LONGER NEW IT'S MATURE IN FACT THE DEMAND FOR JOBS IS EXCEEDING SUPPLY AND WE'RE ACTUALLY IN AS THEY HAVE SHORTAGE- SO THESE THREE FACTORS GASOLINE BURDEN FAMILIES. THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND THE ZIP SHORTAGE REQUIRED THAT WE REFORM EVEY INCENTIVES- AND- SO WE YOU KNOW WE DON'T NEED TO KEEP INCENTIVIZING THE WEALTHIER PEOPLE WHO AREN'T USING MUCH GASOLINE TO SWITCH TO THE US- BUT WE DO NEED TO MAXIMIZE EMISSIONS CUTS BY FOCUSING ON- FOLKS WHO ARE USING IT BUT DRIVING THE MOST USING THE MOST GASOLINE. AND WE DO NEED TO MAXIMIZE EQUITY BY FOCUSING ON THE LOW INCOME DRIVERS WHO ARE BURNING THE MOST GASOLINE AND WE ALSO MAKE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE SCARCE ZAB THE SCARE SUPPLIED ZEDD'S GETS INTO THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE USING IT TO DISPLACE THE MOST GASOLINE- SO THINK ABOUT IT THIS WAY IF WE COULD GET THE BIGGEST GASOLINE USERS INTO STEPS. FIRST IT WOULD TAKE NINE MILLION STEPS ON THE ROAD IN CALIFORNIA TO CUT VEHICLE EMISSIONS IN HALF. AND IF AS CURRENT TRENDS ARE BEARING OUT THESE BIGGEST USERS ARE THE LAST PEOPLE TO SWITCH DESERVES IT'S GOING TO TAKE US TWENTY FOUR MILLION ZAB ON THE ROAD SO NEARLY THREE TIMES AS MANY- AND THERE'S ANOTHER BENEFIT OUT FOR THESE BIGGEST GASOLINE USERS. IF THEY HAVE ENOUGH OF AN INCENTIVE TO SWITCH TO A STEP THEY WILL BE ADDITIONALLY SAVING A LOT OF MONEY SO THE BIGGEST USERS ARE SPENDING. AROUND SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR ON- ON THEIR-VEHICLE THAT FUEL SO IF THEY SWITCHED IS ABSENT THEY COULD SAVE. FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH AND THEY COULD USE THAT MONEY TO MAKE THEIR MONTHLY PAYMENTS ON THEIR EVEY- SO WE GOT A LOT OF BENEFITS HERE THAT ONE'S NOT COMING FROM TAXPAYER DOLLARS- SO IN SHORT. THIS PROGRAM MAXIMIZES EMISSIONS CUTS AND HELPS THE DRIVERS WHO NEED IT THE MOST SO I URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON AB TWENTY EIGHT SIXTY. THANK YOU. THERE'S A BOND ON THE A PHONE LINE. YES THAT YEAR. TAKE IT AWAY. OKAY DAISY BARKER AT DEL AND I'D LIVE IT WOULD KID- WHICH IS WITH RESPECT COUNTY I LIVE WITH MY HUSBAND AND THREE CHILDREN WE ARE CURRENTLY ONLY DRIVING- THANK YOU NINETY EIGHT HONDA ACCORD AT BRADBURY RELIABLE IT REALLY BREAKS DOWN A LOT BY. THE WAY TO THE FINAL OF BY DOING. WHAT IT WOULD BE THE WAY WORLD. BECAUSE THAT BIG THAT WE'LL HAVE ONE CAR. I DRIVE TO WORK EVERY BOARD THE- DAYS I'D GO BACK OVER TO WAITED TO TAKE OUR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL. LATER THAT DAY I HAVE TO PICK UP MY KIDS FROM SCHOOL. THE DRIVE BACK OUT TO TWO LITTLE BOTTLES. TO PICK UP AND HAS BEEN. BUT WORK. ALL AT ALL WE DRY THE CAR ABOUT HOURS A DAY COVER ABOUT HUNDRED. A HUNDRED MILES WE ARE REALLY SUFFERING WITH GAS PRICES GETTING THAT BUT THAT. WOULD BE A MORE RELIABLE CAR. WE WOULD LIKE TO GET ELECTRIC CART BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT GUYS RIGHT GOING UP. AB TWENTY EIGHT SIXTY WILL HELP US. MAKE THE DOWN PAYMENT UNDER THE LEAD GUITAR. WE WOULD USE THE SAVINGS ARE GASOLINE AND MAKE MONTHLY PAYMENTS UNDER LET THE CARD. WE ARE BARELY MAKING IT RIGHT NOW WITH OUR OLD CAR AND I GOT RIGHT. POLICE SAID AB THIRTY SIXTIES. PROBABLY LIKE OURS COULD NOT BE RELIED. DEFINITELY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE OF. A AB TWENTY SIXTEEN IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM SEEN NONE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. C. NINE ABOUT A MODERATOR ANYONE IN SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION TO AB. TWENTY EIGHT SIXTEEN. YOUR ORDER OPPOSITION YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. AGAIN THAT IS ONE AND THEN THEIR APPEARANCE SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION. WE WILL GO TO LINE ONE TWENTY TWO YOUR LINE IS OPEN. LINE ONE TWENTY TWO YOUR LINE IS OPEN. IF YOU HAVE A SON YOU. OKAY WITH THAT WE HAVE NO FURTHER OPPOSITION OR SUPPORT IN Q. THANK YOU VERY MUCH BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE THE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THIS WAS GARCIA. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS ORDER AND I DO APPRECIATE THE ATTENTION ON. FOLKS WERE DRIVING THESE LONG DISTANCES THAT HAVE PEOPLE THAT- WORK NEAR MY DISTRICT IN MY DISTRICT AND ARE COMMUTING TO DISTRICTS MUCH LESS RACIST NINETY MILES AWAY- ON A REGULAR BASIS. INCLUDING SOMEONE ELSE OR TO FAINT OR YOU'RE A SEPARATE BILL. OUT THERE AND SO I DO APPRECIATE THEIR APPROACH I JUST HAVE A QUESTION THERE'S NO PRIORITIZING- LOW TO MODERATE INCOME INDIVIDUALS BUT THERE'S NO REQUIREMENTS. ON ON INCOME WITHIN IN THE PAST THAT THAT'S BEEN A PROBLEM. CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT AND ARE YOU LOOKING TO ADDRESS THAT ARE DEFINITELY WANT TO DO IS MOVED THE INCENTIVES TO LOW TO MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES THAT'S UP INCLUDE LANGUAGE WE DID NOT PUT A SPECIFIC INCOME CAP I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE CONTEMPLATING AS WE AS WE MOVE FORWARD JUST TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT MORE CLEAR BUT THE IDEA IS DEFINITELY TO HAVE THE INCENTIVES- BE MUCH MORE FOCUSED FOR TO BE FOCUS PERIOD ON LOW TO MODERATE CAN FAMILIES AND ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT ARE DRIVING THE MOST. YEAH AND I'M I'M PREPARED TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL TODAY. BUT AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD. I DO THINK WE NEED TO BE INTENTIONAL AND HAVE CLEAR PROTECTIONS ON. ON INCOME CAPS AREN'T SOMETHING TO GUARANTEE. THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY TARGETING. OUR LOW LOW TO MODERATE INCOME INDIVIDUALS OUT WITH THIS AND THAT. THAT WE DON'T JUST LEAVE IT UP. AND HOPE THAT IT WORKS OUT THAT WAY YEAH I AGREE WITH YOU AND I THINK- WE HAVEN'T. AGREED UPON THAT LANGUAGE UP I THINK WE'RE IT WILL DEFINITELY BE DOING. SOMETHING IN THE COMING WEEKS. YEAH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK ANY AMENDMENTS THAT YOU ACCEPTED THE KIND OF ADDRESSES SOME OF THOSE ISSUES YEAH WE DO. SO- WE LIKE TO CLOSE THIS TICKET I JUST RESPECT THEIR FIBER THANK YOU VERY MUCH BUSH'S THE PAST APPROPRIATIONS AS AMENDED AND SECTION THIS CALL THE ROLL. RIVAS FLOOR- LAURA I BOERNER HORVATH. HI FRIEDMAN FRIEDMAN AYE GARCIA AYE GARCIA AYE MATHIS NECESS IRA TO G. RITSU CHII REYES REYES ICR TWO SEYARTO NOW STONE. STONE I WOULD DIMAS ITSELF. ALL RIGHT MEMBERS HAVE A SUMMER SUCI. THE LAST ONE OF THE EVENING. ABOUT. SEN THANK YOU- AB TWENTY SEVEN NINETY THREE. SIX IMPROVE THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM BY REQUIRING THE A OR B. TO CONDUCT A REGULAR REVIEW THE PROGRAM TO ENSURE THAT IT'S MEETING ITS OBJECTIVES AB TWENTY SEVEN NINETY THREE WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THERE BE TO ADOPT PUBLIC BANKING METRICS TO TRACK THE NUMBER OF THE UNUSED ALLOWANCES ANOTHER COMPLIANCE INSTRUMENTS. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS CAITLYN SUTTER BUT THEN BORROWER DEFENSE FUND AND DAVID WEISS COP WITHIN THAT NEXT GEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF AB. TWENTY SEVEN NINETY THREE. OKAY BUT A LOT OF THIS THE PEOPLE READ THEIR STUTTERING THE PHONE. PERFECT GO AHEAD. SAME HERE- AGAIN KEEP THE MURDERS BETTER SENIOR MANAGER FOR YOU APPOINTED AN ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND- AND ALSO THE ASSEMBLY APPOINTEES THE INDEPENDENT EMISSIONS MARKET ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT IS REFERENCED IN THE BILL- THANK YOU WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT MY COMMENTS TODAY ARE SOLELY ON BEHALF OF YEAH- I'M AN EASY ACTIVITY ALONG THE BORDER OF THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AND WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO SUPPORT THE DIRECTION IN QUESTION. AND AB TWENTY SEVEN NINETY THREE. HOW HAS LED THE WAY IN. CLIMATE CHANGE. BUT IF THE CRISIS CONTINUES TO ACCELERATE IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT CALIFORNIA KEEP FAITH AND EXPLAINS THE THIRTIETH MEETING AND THIS INTERACTION% GOAL. PROVIDED BY A WELL DESIGNED MISSION POP. APPLE TRADE PROGRAM IS ESSENTIAL PART OF THE SPEECH TO DEFINE A POLICY AND A FIRM DECLINING CAPTIVATE. ARE YOU NEEDING CLIMATE. REGULAR EVALUATION AND STATE PROGRAMS IN A MATTER OF GOOD PUBLIC POLICY A PREDETERMINED SCHEDULE AND PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT PROGRAMS ARE FOR PURPOSE AND DELIVERING UNCLES IS IMPORTANT IN ANY. AND AS WE SEE MORE AND MORE DEVASTATING IMPACTS ON CLIMATE CHANGE IT IS IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT OUR CLIMATE POLICIES OUR AMBITIOUS ENOUGH HE PUMPED. AB TWENTY SEVEN NINETY THREE WOULD INSTITUTE A REGULAR REVIEW WITH THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AND WOULD PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED CLARITY ON THE TIMING AND SCOPE OF POTENTIAL PROGRAM I THINK. THIS IS IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN CERTAINTY OF A MISSION REDUCTION BUT ALSO INCREASE CERTAINTY FOR REGULATED ENTITIES. THE INDEPENDENT EMISSIONS MARKET BY THREE COMMITTEE AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ADVISORY COMMITTEE BOTH MADE NUMEROUS RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING ENTRY. A REGULAR PROGRAM REVIEW WOULD PROVIDE A PUBLIC AND DELIBERATE PROCESS TO CONSIDER THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. THE REGIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INITIATIVE ON THE EAST COAST AND THE EUROPEAN UNION EMISSIONS TRADING SYSTEM- UNDERGO REGULAR PROGRAM. AND WASHINGTON STATE WILL INCLUDE ONE AND IT'S HAPPENING THAT'S PROGRAM LAUNCHING NEXT YEAR. YEP APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MARIE FIFTEENTH NEAR STEP ON THIS ISSUE- AND WE HAD VERY PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION CAN IT STAFF TO REFINE THE FINDING. OF THIS REVIEW AND I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK WE HAVE DAVID ON THE PHONE AS WELL. BUT A MODERATE WE HAVE A DAVID. ON THE PHONE. ARE YOU ONLINE HERE LATELY YEAH HERE. YOUR LINE IS OPEN. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH- JERRY THIS MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE. IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SEVEN NINETY THREE. MY NAME IS GETTING. DAVID WEISS CUP A MISSING YOUR POLICY ADVISOR FROM NEXT GEN CALIFORNIA. ACTION SPORTS POLICIES AND PROGRAMS THAT FOSTER AFFECTED INEQUITABLE SOLUTIONS. WE'VE BEEN CLOSELY INVOLVED WITH DEPENDING AND WORKING TO IMPROVE CALIFORNIA'S CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM FOR MORE THAN A DECADE WE SUPPORT IN THE BALLPARK START WORK ON CAP AND TRADE AND RECOGNIZED THE TANGIBLE BENEFITS THAT IT DELIVERS TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT IT HAS BECOME MORE CLEAR EVERY DAY TO THE STATE IS NOT ON TRACK TO ACHIEVE ITS TWENTY THIRTY EMISSIONS REDUCTION TARGET WE THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO ENSURE THE CAP AND TRADE IN ALL OF OUR CLIENTS PROGRAMS ARE WORKING AS WELL AS POSSIBLE. NUMBERS INDEPENDENT ANALYSES FROM ACADEMICS INVESTORS AND OTHERS HAVE RAISED QUESTIONS. ABOUT THE PROGRAM'S ABILITY TO DELIVER ITS FORECASTED GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTIONS. AND IN A NUTSHELL THIS IS BECAUSE TOO MANY ALLOWANCES ARE BEING MADE AVAILABLE AND BANKED IN PRIVATE HANDS. DECEMBER'S THE PROGRAM'S ABILITY TO SPUR INVESTMENT AND BEHAVIOR CHANGES THAT CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST INDUSTRIAL POLLUTERS. THAT WE WILL NEED TO SEE IF WE ARE HIT OR TWENTY THIRTY TARGET. LET'S GO ASK THE AGENCY TO FIRST CONDUCT A REGULAR ISSUE OF THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AND SHARE MORE INFORMATION. ABOUT THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND DYNAMICS OF THE MARKET WITH LEGISLATORS AND THE PUBLIC AND TO AUTHORIZES CARB TO IT'S DESIGNED TO MEET ITS POLICY OBJECTIVES. WE BELIEVE THIS BILL STRIKES THE NEED TO BALANCE BETWEEN ALLOWING THE AGENCY FLEXIBILITY TO DO ITS JOB. WHILE ALSO GIVING LAWMAKERS AND THE PUBLIC INFORMATION THEY NEED TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE FUTURE OF THIS IMPORTANT PROGRAM. THANK YOU AND RESPECTFULLY ASK HERE I THOUGHT.
