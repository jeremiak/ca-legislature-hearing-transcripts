IS THAT TWO POINT NINE. OF THIS

00:12:32.718 --> 00:12:34.854
CARE. WOULD GO TO SUPPORT A

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.522
BASIC WORKLOAD BUDGET.

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:37.523
CONSISTING OF THINGS LIKE

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.692
EMPLOYEE SALARY INCREASES WOULD

00:12:39.758 --> 00:12:41.460
COVER OPERATING COSTS SUCH AS

00:12:41.527 --> 00:12:43.562
EMPLOYEE BENEFIT COSTS. AND

00:12:43.629 --> 00:12:45.331
THEN THE REMAINING THREE POINT

00:12:45.397 --> 00:12:46.499
SIX MILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE

00:12:46.565 --> 00:12:48.968
AVAILABLE TO THE SCHOOL TO

00:12:49.034 --> 00:12:50.369
ADDRESS ITS BUDGET DEFICIT. AND

00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:51.837
ON THIS LATTER POINT- THERE'S

00:12:51.904 --> 00:12:54.507
SOME GOOD NEWS HERE- HE STANDS

00:12:54.573 --> 00:12:57.610
IN SUCH A PAGE TO ELIMINATE ITS

00:12:57.676 --> 00:12:58.777
DEFICIT. I THAT HAD EXIST PRIOR

00:12:58.844 --> 00:13:00.546
TO THE PANDEMIC. I'M IN THE

00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:02.114
BUDGET YEAR AND ACTUALLY

00:13:02.181 --> 00:13:03.682
ANTICIPATES ENDING THE BUDGET

00:13:03.749 --> 00:13:05.551
YOU'RE WITH A BUDGET SURPLUS.

00:13:05.618 --> 00:13:06.852
WE THINK THIS IS A POSITIVE

00:13:06.919 --> 00:13:10.890
DEVELOPMENT- THIS YEAR'S. WELL

00:13:10.956 --> 00:13:12.525
IN TERMS OF OUR THOUGHTS ON

00:13:12.591 --> 00:13:14.894
THESE MATTERS- WE THINK LOOKING

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.663
AT TASTING SPENDING PLAN- SIX

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:19.064
SUGGESTS THAT THE PROPOSAL

00:13:19.131 --> 00:13:20.633
LEVEL OF FUNDING IS ADEQUATE TO

00:13:20.699 --> 00:13:22.034
SUPPORT HE SINGS BUDGET WE

00:13:22.101 --> 00:13:23.135
THINK THE LEGISLATURE COULD

00:13:23.202 --> 00:13:24.637
EVEN TREAT THIS AUGMENTATION AS

00:13:24.703 --> 00:13:26.639
A MAXIMUM LEVEL SUPPORT AND HOW

00:13:26.705 --> 00:13:27.706
SOME OPTIONS TO ADJUST

00:13:27.773 --> 00:13:29.575
ACCORDINGLY WHERE- THE KNEE

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:32.845
REVISION TO COME AND- WITH THE-

00:13:32.912 --> 00:13:34.180
WORST BUDGET CONDITION AND WE

00:13:34.246 --> 00:13:36.081
HAVE CURRENTLY I'M FOR EXAMPLE

00:13:36.148 --> 00:13:37.783
LEGISLATURE COULD CONTEMPLATE

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:38.984
SUPPORTING DIFFERENT LEVELS OF

00:13:39.051 --> 00:13:40.753
EMPLOYEE SALARIES COULD ALSO

00:13:40.819 --> 00:13:42.688
CONCENTRATE ON A DIFFERENT

00:13:42.755 --> 00:13:44.390
LEVEL OF BUDGET SURPLUS FOR THE

00:13:44.456 --> 00:13:45.691
SCHOOL. AGAIN THESE ARE ALL

00:13:45.758 --> 00:13:47.026
THINGS LEGISLATURE COULD WEIGH

00:13:47.092 --> 00:13:48.861
ONCE IT HAS MORE INFORMATION

00:13:48.928 --> 00:13:50.996
THAN THEY- ARE MADE ANALYSIS

00:13:51.063 --> 00:13:52.965
ARE ARE ARE ANALYSIS- THAT WE

00:13:53.032 --> 00:13:55.267
SUBMITTED- PUBLICLY A FEW DAYS

00:13:55.334 --> 00:13:57.536
AGO- HAD A FEW OTHER SECTIONS

00:13:57.603 --> 00:13:58.304
IN IT WE HAD A SECTION TALKING

THINKING ABOUT TUITION

00:14:03.976 --> 00:14:05.678
INCREASES AT THESE THINGS WE

00:14:05.744 --> 00:14:07.746
ALSO HAVE A RECOMMENDATION TO

00:14:07.813 --> 00:14:09.181
ACQUIRE HASTINGS TO REPORT ON

00:14:09.248 --> 00:14:11.317
HIS EXPERIENCE ON USING ONLINE

EDUCATION DURING THE PANDEMIC.

00:14:13.118 --> 00:14:14.086
BOB FOR THE SAKE OF TIME ALL

00:14:14.153 --> 00:14:15.688

I MIGHT HAVE A QUESTION OR TWO

00:14:25.631 --> 00:14:27.900
TO DRAW THIS OUT WE HAVE.

00:14:27.967 --> 00:14:28.734
THIRTEEN ISSUES AND I KNOW

PRESENTATION SAID THE AGENDA.

00:14:34.273 --> 00:14:35.908

00:14:35.975 --> 00:14:37.176
WE'LL SEE WHERE WE ARE AT THE

00:14:37.243 --> 00:14:40.579

UC HASTINGS WILL HOLD ITS

00:14:58.097 --> 00:14:59.932
TUITION FLAT THIS YEAR. AND I'M

00:14:59.999 --> 00:15:01.467
A BIG FAN OF YOU SEE ACING

SCHOOL LIVE FRIENDS THERE- I

00:15:04.837 --> 00:15:07.706
GUESS MY QUESTION IS- WHY IS UC

00:15:07.773 --> 00:15:08.841
HASTINGS BEING TREATED

00:15:08.907 --> 00:15:10.609
DIFFERENTLY FROM OTHER LAW

00:15:10.676 --> 00:15:12.544
SCHOOLS IN THE SYSTEM. AS WELL

00:15:12.611 --> 00:15:14.913
AS OTHER. DEPARTMENTS AND

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:17.850
UNIVERSITIES. ARE THERE PLANS

00:15:17.916 --> 00:15:21.020

00:15:21.086 --> 00:15:22.688
OTHER UC'S OR THE UC HASTINGS

00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:24.256
GOING TO BE A ONE OFF AND THIS

00:15:24.323 --> 00:15:26.759
QUESTION WILL BE DIRECTED TO

00:15:26.825 --> 00:15:32.765
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. FOR

00:15:32.831 --> 00:15:35.134
THE APARTMENT OF FINANCE. BRIAN

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.169
RELIGIOUS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

00:15:37.236 --> 00:15:39.638
I THINK THE QUESTION SENATOR I

00:15:39.705 --> 00:15:42.641
WOULD KNOW THAT HASTINGS THE

00:15:42.708 --> 00:15:44.610
PROPOSAL IS FOR A SPECIFIC

00:15:44.677 --> 00:15:46.745
TUITION INCREASE THAT THE BOARD

00:15:46.812 --> 00:15:47.346
OF DIRECTORS PROPOSED IN THE

00:15:47.413 --> 00:15:50.716
FALL. AND IT'S A TWO POINT ONE

00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:52.818
NET REVENUE GAIN THAT THAT

00:15:52.885 --> 00:15:54.753
TUITION INCREASE WOULD HAVE

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:56.088
EARNED IN RESOURCES FOR

00:15:56.155 --> 00:15:58.390
HASTINGS CHART PROPOSAL IS TO

00:15:58.457 --> 00:16:00.259
PROVIDE THE TWO POINT ONE

00:16:00.326 --> 00:16:02.461
SPECIFICALLY TO BALANCE OUT

00:16:02.528 --> 00:16:05.197
THAT TUITION AND TO FUNCTION AS

00:16:05.264 --> 00:16:07.566
A TUITION BY OUR- IN TERMS OF-

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:09.134
TREATING. DIFFERENTLY THE

00:16:09.201 --> 00:16:10.936
ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T THAT'S

00:16:11.003 --> 00:16:13.972
NOT THE APPROACH. AS WE VIEW IT

00:16:14.039 --> 00:16:17.743
THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA.

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:19.478
WE BUDGET IT IN A IN A VERY

00:16:19.545 --> 00:16:22.381
SPECIFIC WAY WHERE IT'S SO MUCH

00:16:22.448 --> 00:16:24.516
LARGER AND FUNCTIONS AND IN SO

00:16:24.583 --> 00:16:25.918
MANY DIFFERENT WAYS INCLUDING

00:16:25.984 --> 00:16:27.453
UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION WHICH

00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:29.021
IS THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF

00:16:29.088 --> 00:16:31.590
STATE FUNDING- YEAH. BUT IT

00:16:31.657 --> 00:16:33.759
JUST THIS IS THE APPROACH THAT

00:16:33.826 --> 00:16:35.027
WE'VE TAKEN FOR HASTINGS ON

00:16:35.094 --> 00:16:37.529
WHAT THE UC WE HAVE THE

00:16:37.596 --> 00:16:39.131
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL AND

00:16:39.198 --> 00:16:40.999

00:16:41.066 --> 00:16:43.102
THAT. WE'RE ALSO PROPOSING

00:16:43.168 --> 00:16:46.071
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR THE

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. ON

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.508
TOP OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

00:16:49.575 --> 00:16:50.609
SURVEY AND I UNDERSTAND

00:16:50.676 --> 00:16:51.944
OBVIOUSLY HASTINGS'S IS A

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:54.546
SPECIAL CASE BUT- WHEN YOU TALK

00:16:54.613 --> 00:16:56.248
TO ANYBODY IN UNIVERSITY

00:16:56.315 --> 00:16:58.283
CALIFORNIA SYSTEM I THINK THERE

00:16:58.350 --> 00:16:59.418
IS A CONCERN THERE THAT THEY

00:16:59.485 --> 00:17:01.019
ARE. BEING ASKED TO DO A LOT

00:17:01.086 --> 00:17:02.454
RIGHT NOW ALSO BEING ASKED TO

00:17:02.521 --> 00:17:05.958

00:17:21.039 --> 00:17:23.409
INCREASE WHICH COMES ON THE 10%

00:17:23.475 --> 00:17:26.111

00:32:03.054 --> 00:32:04.122
IN WHERE WE'RE STILL FOLLOWING

00:32:04.188 --> 00:32:05.423
UP WITH THEM SO WE PLAN TO.

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:06.891
RETURN TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE AND

00:32:06.958 --> 00:32:08.493
RETURNS THE CAN BE STAFF AND

00:32:08.559 --> 00:32:10.295
PROVIDE THEM. A FULLER

00:32:10.361 --> 00:32:11.796
ASSESSMENT ONCE WE GET THOSE

00:32:11.863 --> 00:32:13.097
OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS RESOLVED

00:32:13.164 --> 00:32:14.399
BUT WE DO HAVE ON TWO ISSUES

00:32:14.465 --> 00:32:16.200
THAT WE'D LIKE TO RAISE FOR THE

00:32:16.267 --> 00:32:17.702
SUBCOMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION.

00:32:17.769 --> 00:32:19.037
THE FIRST ISSUE IS THAT THERE

00:32:19.103 --> 00:32:21.205
IS SOME UNSPENT FUNDING- IN

00:32:21.272 --> 00:32:22.807
THIS BROADBAND PROGRAM IT'S

00:32:22.874 --> 00:32:24.509
CONNECTED TO GRANTS THAT WERE

00:32:24.575 --> 00:32:25.810
PROVIDED IN THE PREVIOUS BUDGET

00:32:25.877 --> 00:32:27.345
THAT WERE INTENDED AS SUCH

00:32:27.412 --> 00:32:28.913
LIBRARIES AND- CONNECTING TO

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:30.048
THE INTERNET AND UPGRADING

00:32:30.114 --> 00:32:31.816
THEIR INTERNET SPEEDS. AND WE

00:32:31.883 --> 00:32:34.585
THINK IT'S POSSIBLE THESE ARMS-

00:32:34.652 --> 00:32:35.753
FUNDS COULD BE USED TO OFFSET

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:37.322
SOME OF THESE COSTS ON A ONE

00:32:37.388 --> 00:32:38.990
TIME BASIS AND INITIAL YEARS.

00:32:39.057 --> 00:32:40.458
WE RECOMMEND YOU GET SOME MORE

00:32:40.525 --> 00:32:40.992
INFORMATION ON THE STATE

00:32:41.059 --> 00:32:42.994
LIBRARY ON HOW THEY PLAN TO

00:32:43.061 --> 00:32:44.729
SPEND THE REMAINING UNSPENT

00:32:44.796 --> 00:32:45.530
FUNDS AND SEE IF THEY ARE

00:32:45.596 --> 00:32:49.701
POTENTIALLY. AVAILABLE TO

00:32:49.767 --> 00:32:50.435
OFFSET SOME OF THESE COSTS. THE

00:32:50.501 --> 00:32:51.069
OTHER ISSUE LIKE TO RAISE YOUR

00:32:51.135 --> 00:32:52.637
CONCERN. IS RECENT YEARS THERE

00:32:52.704 --> 00:32:54.505
HAS BEEN SOME OVER BUDGETING IN

00:32:54.572 --> 00:32:57.308
THE PROGRAM- THAT IS. THAT THE

00:32:57.375 --> 00:32:58.376
STATE HAS BEEN APPROPRIATING

00:32:58.443 --> 00:32:59.477
FUNDS AT A SLIGHTLY HIGHER

00:32:59.544 --> 00:33:02.046
LEVELS AND- ACTUAL SPENDING ON

00:33:02.113 --> 00:33:03.648
THE PROGRAM SH. AND ACCORDING

00:33:03.715 --> 00:33:05.917
TO STATE LIBRARY OF THE PURPOSE

00:33:05.983 --> 00:33:07.552
OF THIS IS TO PROVIDE. THE

00:33:07.618 --> 00:33:09.420
STATE LIBRARY. A CUSHION IN

00:33:09.487 --> 00:33:11.689
CASE THERE IS A UNEXPECTED COST

00:33:11.756 --> 00:33:13.124
INCREASES AND NEW YEAR. FOR

00:33:13.191 --> 00:33:14.826
EXAMPLE AN EXCHANGE AND

00:33:14.892 --> 00:33:16.394
SURCHARGES THAT IT'S CHARGED BY

00:33:16.461 --> 00:33:19.364
THE BY THE PUBLIC UTILITIES

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:21.065
COMMISSION. WE OVERREACH IS

00:33:21.132 --> 00:33:22.300
ARMING THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

00:33:22.367 --> 00:33:24.235
DOLLARS SO INTERNET ITSELF IT'S

00:33:24.302 --> 00:33:26.104
NOT IMPACTING THE STATE OUR

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:28.039
GENERAL FUND A CONDITION.

00:33:28.106 --> 00:33:29.741
SIGNIFICANT RANGE WE THINK A

00:33:29.807 --> 00:33:31.042
MORE RATIONAL APPROACH WOULD BE

00:33:31.109 --> 00:33:34.645

TAKE FROM A STATE PROGRAM SO WE

00:33:52.029 --> 00:33:54.732
THINK IT WOULD BE IT WOULD BE A

00:33:54.799 --> 00:33:55.533

00:44:43.881 --> 00:44:47.017
THEN SECONDLY FROM. I THINK IT

00:44:47.084 --> 00:44:49.787
WAS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:44:49.853 --> 00:44:50.287
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE THAT

00:44:50.354 --> 00:44:53.524
MENTIONED- THAT DATA ISN'T

00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:56.760
TOTALLY AND YET TO ACCEPT FOR.

00:44:56.827 --> 00:44:59.797
OF THAT FOR HER CLASSES WERE UP

00:44:59.863 --> 00:45:01.965
IN CAREER AND TECHNICAL

00:45:02.032 --> 00:45:05.102
EDUCATION AND- ONE OTHER THING

00:45:05.169 --> 00:45:07.604
AND SO MY QUESTION IS THERE ANY

00:45:07.671 --> 00:45:09.940
WAY AT THIS POINT TWO WITH DATA

00:45:10.007 --> 00:45:11.608
TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THE

00:45:11.675 --> 00:45:17.481
PANDEMIC ON ADULT EDUCATION.

00:45:17.548 --> 00:45:19.016
BERMAN ROMAN DATA I MEAN

00:45:19.083 --> 00:45:21.452
OVERALL WE'VE SEEN ENROLLMENTS-

00:45:21.518 --> 00:45:23.987
IT KIND OF DECLINE STATEWIDE

00:45:24.054 --> 00:45:26.523
AND SO WE SEE A DECLINE AROUND

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:29.426
THE SAME RATE THAT- IT'S

00:45:29.493 --> 00:45:31.495
DECLINED FOR. COMMUNITY

00:45:31.562 --> 00:45:35.732
COLLEGES AND PRESUMABLY FOR-

00:45:35.799 --> 00:45:38.368
FOR K. TWELVE SCHOOLS OUR FINAL

00:45:38.435 --> 00:45:40.838
ANALYSIS TYPICALLY COMES IN

00:45:40.904 --> 00:45:44.274
FROM OUR COLLEGES AROUND- MARCH

00:45:44.341 --> 00:45:46.076
APRIL AND SPRING WE ALSO GET

00:45:46.143 --> 00:45:48.045
MORE DETAILS AROUND THE TYPES

00:45:48.112 --> 00:45:50.948
OF ENROLLMENT. AS A REFERENCE

00:45:51.014 --> 00:45:52.449
ONE AREA THAT WE HAVE SEEN

00:45:52.516 --> 00:45:55.752
INTEREST- IS AROUND DIGITAL

00:45:55.819 --> 00:45:58.088
LITERACY PROGRAM SO WILL WANT

00:45:58.155 --> 00:46:00.290
TO DO A DEEPER DIVE INTO THAT

00:46:00.357 --> 00:46:03.794
AND SEE. WHY THAT IS OF

00:46:03.861 --> 00:46:04.361
INTEREST ONE PRESUMPTION IS

00:46:04.428 --> 00:46:06.864
THAT AS MORE PARENTS ARE ALSO

00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:09.066
WORKING WITH THEIR STUDENTS AT

00:46:09.133 --> 00:46:11.502
HOME- THEY ALSO HAVE INTEREST

00:46:11.568 --> 00:46:14.238
IN GAINING SKILLS IN THIS AREA.

00:46:14.304 --> 00:46:16.206
AND WE'RE SEEINGMORE QUESTIONS

00:46:16.273 --> 00:46:17.774
EMERGE AROUND SHORT TERM

00:46:17.841 --> 00:46:19.843
PROGRAMS THAT MAY BE AN AREA

00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:21.845
WHERE COLLEGES ANARCHY TOLD

00:46:21.912 --> 00:46:24.982
PROGRAMS CAN ADAPT THAT WE MEET

00:46:25.048 --> 00:46:26.984
OUR DEMAND OF CALIFORNIANS. AND

00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:27.851
THEN LET ME ASK A FOLLOW UP

00:46:27.918 --> 00:46:30.087

00:59:29.966 --> 00:59:30.800
DISCRETION OVER HOW TO

00:59:30.867 --> 00:59:33.136
IMPLEMENT THE RULES SO. THAT

00:59:33.202 --> 00:59:35.872
MAKES IT A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT

00:59:35.939 --> 00:59:36.439
TO ANTICIPATE WHAT THE COST

00:59:36.506 --> 00:59:39.375

PROPOSAL WHICH APPEARS ON PGE

00:59:58.461 --> 01:00:01.264
TWENTY VERY DONDE. I DO PROVIDE

01:00:01.331 --> 01:00:02.532
SOME BRIEF BACKGROUND ON THIS

01:00:02.598 --> 01:00:03.599
PROPOSAL BECAUSE IT IS A NEW

01:00:03.666 --> 01:00:04.801
ISSUE EMERGING THIS YEAR DURING

01:00:04.867 --> 01:00:06.836
THE PANDEMIC. WE KNOW THAT IN

01:00:06.903 --> 01:00:08.338
ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR CAL GRANT

01:00:08.404 --> 01:00:09.605
STUDENTS NEED TO DEMONSTRATE A

01:00:09.672 --> 01:00:10.606
CERTAIN LEVEL OF FINANCIAL

01:00:10.673 --> 01:00:12.875
NEED. BASED ON HOW CAMPUS IS

01:00:12.942 --> 01:00:13.476
CALCULATED STUDENTS FINANCIAL

01:00:13.543 --> 01:00:15.545
NEED. INTENSELY HIGHER FOR

01:00:15.611 --> 01:00:16.346
THOSE STUDENTS WERE LIVING ON

01:00:16.412 --> 01:00:18.848
CAMPUS AND STUDENTS WERE LIVING

01:00:18.915 --> 01:00:20.216
AT HOME WITH FAMILY. BECAUSE

01:00:20.283 --> 01:00:21.317
CAMPUSES THIS YEAR LARGELY

01:00:21.384 --> 01:00:22.852
OPERATING REMOTELY WERE SEEN

01:00:22.919 --> 01:00:23.619
MANY STUDENTS WHO WOULD

01:00:23.686 --> 01:00:24.787
OTHERWISE HAVE LIVED IN THE

01:00:24.854 --> 01:00:25.388
DORMS ARE INSTEAD LIVING AT

01:00:25.455 --> 01:00:27.256
HOME WITH FAMILY. AND A NUMBER

01:00:27.323 --> 01:00:29.025
OF THOSE STUDENTS HAVE LOST

01:00:29.092 --> 01:00:29.792
THEIR **** AN ELIGIBILITY AS

01:00:29.859 --> 01:00:31.194

UNINTENDED EFFECT. AND WHAT

CAMPUS IS OPERATING REMOTELY WE

01:00:35.465 --> 01:00:36.666
THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO ALLOW

01:00:36.733 --> 01:00:38.234
STUDENTS TO HAVE MOVED HOME TO

01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:39.335
THE PANDEMIC TO RECEIVE THE

01:00:39.402 --> 01:00:40.536
TUITION COVERAGE THEY OTHERWISE

01:00:40.603 --> 01:00:42.505
WOULD HAVE RECEIVED HAD THEY

01:00:42.572 --> 01:00:44.073
LIVED ON CAMPUS. BUT MORE GIVEN

01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:45.608

01:00:45.675 --> 01:00:46.943
WORDS ARE DRAWN IN THE CURRENT

01:00:47.010 --> 01:00:48.344

01:00:48.411 --> 01:00:49.412
PROPOSAL WOULD HAVE THE BENEFIT

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:52.648
OF RESTORING THAT EXPENSIVE-

01:00:52.715 --> 01:00:54.117
YOU NEED COMMISSION HAS NOTED

01:00:54.183 --> 01:00:55.551

ESTIMATED NUMBER OF IMPACTED

01:00:56.986 --> 01:00:59.055
STUDENTS. AND BECAUSE THE

01:00:59.122 --> 01:00:59.956
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED FUNDING

01:01:00.023 --> 01:01:01.557
LEVELS FIFTY EIGHT MILLION IS

01:01:01.624 --> 01:01:03.292
BASED ON ESTIMATES PROVIDED BY

DURING THE PANDEMIC AND AS A

01:01:33.656 --> 01:01:34.657

SET THE COSTS WOULD INCREASE IN

01:09:28.297 --> 01:09:30.165
THE OUT YEARS THIS IS A PATTERN

01:09:30.232 --> 01:09:31.467
WE COMMONLY SEE WHAT PROPOSALS

01:09:31.534 --> 01:09:33.435
THAT IMPACT ONE INCOMING NEW

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:35.638

CAN EXTENSION. BUT PARTICULARLY

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:52.288
EXPANSION SUCH AS THIS ONE THAT

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:53.956
HAVE ESCALATING COSTS. IF THE

01:09:54.924 --> 01:09:55.958
THINK THIS PROPOSAL IS WORTH

01:09:56.025 --> 01:09:57.259
CONSIDERING FOR THE REASONS

01:09:59.161 --> 01:10:00.029
QUITE CLOSELY WITH RECENT

KEY BENEFIT WE SEE INNOCENT.

01:10:09.572 --> 01:10:11.674
THAT WOULD TARGET ADDITIONAL

COMMON STRUCTURES IS TRY EIGHT

01:10:16.478 --> 01:10:18.547
IF YOU'RE TO WE DO RAISE ONE.

01:10:18.614 --> 01:10:19.315
ISSUE HAVE FOR THE LARGEST TO

01:10:19.381 --> 01:10:22.117
CAN. IN RECENT YEARS LARGEST

01:10:22.184 --> 01:10:23.018
EXPRESSED INTEREST IN

01:10:23.085 --> 01:10:24.086
SIMPLIFYING THE CAL GRANT

01:10:24.153 --> 01:10:26.088
PROGRAMS WITH THE GOAL OF

01:10:26.155 --> 01:10:26.689
MAKING IT EASIER FOR STUDENTS

01:10:26.755 --> 01:10:28.490
TO NAVIGATE. CREATING A

01:10:28.557 --> 01:10:29.792
SUPPLEMENTAL AWARD FOR SPECIFIC

01:10:29.858 --> 01:10:31.860
STUDENT GROUPS COULD RUN

01:10:31.927 --> 01:10:32.428
COUNTER TO HIS INTERESTS AND

01:10:32.494 --> 01:10:34.330
SIMPLIFICATION. IN THE LONG

01:10:34.396 --> 01:10:35.431
TERM WE THINK THERE COULD BE

01:10:35.497 --> 01:10:37.633
SIMPLER MORE SYSTEMATIC OPTIONS

01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:39.501
TO EXPANDING ON TUITION AID.

01:10:39.568 --> 01:10:40.803
CURRENTLY AS YOU MAY KNOW WHILE

01:10:40.869 --> 01:10:41.937
STUDENTS APPLY FOR FINANCIAL

01:10:42.004 --> 01:10:43.505
AID ARE SIGNED SOMETHING CALLED

01:10:43.572 --> 01:10:44.773
AN EXPECTED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION

01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:46.875
OR ESC. THIS IS AN INDEX THAT'S

01:10:46.942 --> 01:10:47.810
INTENDED TO MEASURE THEIR

01:10:47.876 --> 01:10:48.844
ABILITY TO PAY FOR COLLEGE

01:10:48.911 --> 01:10:50.579
BASED ON FACTORS SUCH AS THEIR

01:10:50.646 --> 01:10:53.482
HOUSEHOLD INCOMES SIZE ASSETS.

01:10:53.549 --> 01:10:55.918
STRUCTURE CURRENTLY THE SYNTAX

01:10:55.985 --> 01:10:57.119
IS OF LIMITED USE IN

01:10:57.186 --> 01:10:58.087
PRIORITIZING STUDENTS FOR

01:10:58.153 --> 01:10:59.288
FINANCIALLY JUST BECAUSE SO

01:10:59.355 --> 01:11:00.789
MANY STUDENTS ARE CLUSTERED IN

01:11:00.856 --> 01:11:02.725
THE VERY LOWEST POSSIBLE VALUE.

01:11:02.791 --> 01:11:04.226
BIAS VERY RECENT FEDERAL

01:11:04.293 --> 01:11:05.894
LEGISLATION PASSED IN DECEMBER

01:11:05.961 --> 01:11:07.529
HAS THAT INTEREST IN CHANGES TO

01:11:07.596 --> 01:11:08.364
THIS MEASURE THAT WE THINK WILL

01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:09.498
MAKE IT MORE USEFUL AND

01:11:09.565 --> 01:11:10.499
PRIORITIZING THE VERY HIGH

01:11:10.566 --> 01:11:12.267
SCHOOL STUDENTS IN THE FUTURE

01:11:12.334 --> 01:11:13.002
WHEN IT'S IMPLEMENTED IN THE

01:11:13.068 --> 01:11:15.571
TWENTY. TWENTY THREE TWENTY

01:11:15.638 --> 01:11:17.106
FOUR WORK ACT. SO WE KNOW THIS

01:11:17.172 --> 01:11:18.140
BECAUSE WE THINK IT OPENS UP

01:11:18.207 --> 01:11:19.508
THE POSSIBILITY OF USING THIS

01:11:19.575 --> 01:11:21.543
IN TAX AS A MEANS TO PRIORITIZE

01:11:21.610 --> 01:11:23.946
STUDENTS FOR NATIONAL AID

01:11:24.013 --> 01:11:24.880
MOVING FORWARD. ULTIMATELY THE

01:11:24.947 --> 01:11:26.548
LARGE CHOOSES TO GET HIGH BUT-

01:11:26.615 --> 01:11:27.416
OUR PRIORITY TO TALK EXTENSION

01:11:27.483 --> 01:11:28.617
THIS YEAR WE DO THINK THAT THE

01:11:28.684 --> 01:11:29.918
GOVERNOR'S. MERITS

01:11:29.985 --> 01:11:30.519
CONSIDERATION AS IN YOUR TERM

01:11:30.586 --> 01:11:32.621
OPTION TO EXPANDING IT FOR

01:11:32.688 --> 01:11:33.656
GROUP OF STUDENTS VERY HIGH

01:11:33.722 --> 01:11:35.057
NEED. BUT IN THE LONG TERM

01:11:35.124 --> 01:11:36.492
WEARING COURAGE LEGISLATURE

01:11:36.558 --> 01:11:38.160
EXPLORE. MORE SYSTEMATIC AND

01:11:38.227 --> 01:11:39.261
BECOMES A MORE STREAMLINED

01:11:39.328 --> 01:11:40.529
