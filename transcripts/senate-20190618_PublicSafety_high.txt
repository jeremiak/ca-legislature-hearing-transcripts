THE RATE SEEN NINE LET'S SEE IF THERE'S CALM ANSWER QUESTIONS BY MY COLLEAGUES [inaudible] WE'LL GO -- I JUST WANNA MAKE ONE SLIGHT -- APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING THIS BILL AND I THINK -- WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT? THE LAWS WAS FIRST PUT INTO PLACE. IS A VERY EFFECTIVE TOOL -- TO ASSIST -- THOSE CLOSE TO PEOPLE WHO ARE -- KNOWN TO BE MAKING THREATS OF VIOLENCE AGAINST THEMSELVES OR OTHERS. TO TEMPORARILY REMOVE WEAPONS BUT AND WE'VE SEEN -- IT WAS LOW UPTAKE IN THE INITIAL YEARS AFTER THE BILL WAS PASSED BUT THERE'S BEEN INCREASING BUT WE'VE ALSO FOUND THAT -- THERE'S A LOT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT IS NOT AWARE OF THE TOOL AND IF WE TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE INCIDENT THAT INSPIRED THE TOOL WHICH WAS THE ISLA VISTA SHOOTING. THE MOTHER OF THAT SHOOTER WAS QUITE AWARE OF THE THREATS THAT THAT SHOOTER WAS MAKING. AND I SAW HIS POST THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO GO OUT AND DO A SHOOTING AND HAD -- ENLISTED LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE A TOOL AVAILABLE SO THE MORE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS WHERE THE MORE -- MOTHERS LIKE THE INDIVIDUAL IN THIS CASE WOULD BE ABLE TO BE SERVED BECAUSE WHEN THEY CONTACT LAW ENFORCEMENT LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN SUGGESTS THAT THERE SUCH A TOOL AVAILABLE SO REALLY APPRECIATE. YOUR BRINGING -- THIS BILL WHICH HELPS M. ACHIEVE THAT. AND WE'VE GOT A MOTION -- I TO CURE OF VALUE TO PREVIOUS SAYS THE CLOTHES THAT OKAY.

FOURTEEN EIGHTY SIX FORTY FIVE SB SIX FORTY FIVE REQUIRES THE POSTING OF THE NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION LIFELINE ON EXISTING LABELS ON GUN PACKAGING. ON THE FIREARM SAFETY CERTIFICATION EXAM AND ON NEW SIGNS AND GUN SHOPS. THERE'S BEEN A STARTLING INCREASE OF FIREARMS SUICIDES IN CALIFORNIA AND CURRENTLY THERE IS NO MANDATED INFORMATION ON SUICIDE PREVENTION RESOURCES AT ANY POINT DURING THE PROCESS OF ATTAINING A FIREARM. THIS GAP WAS HIGHLIGHTED TO ME BY A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER IN VENTURA COUNTY WHO LOST HIS BROTHER TO A FIREARM SUICIDE. AND I AM PROUD TO BE OFFERING HIS LEGISLATIVE IDEA. AB SIX FOUR FIVE RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN THE ASSEMBLY AND IT IS MY HOPE THAT THE BILL WILL PROVIDE GREATER ACCESS TO INFORMATION THAT CONSISTS AN INDIVIDUAL IN CRISIS. THANK YOU. BUT LET'S SEE IF THERE'S WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ELIZABETH THAT'S BEEN US ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN THE COUNTY OF VENTURA I WOULD JUST NOT VERY QUICKLY BETWEEN THE YEARS OF TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN NEARLY.

GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE CAPPING LUNCH REPRESENTING THE NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION CERTAINLY NOT AN OPPOSITION TO THE POLICY AND THE GOALS. AND IN FACT TO THE AMERICAN FOUNDATION OF SUICIDE PREVENTION AND THE NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION. HAVE EMBARKED ON A A NATIONWIDE PROGRAM IN THIS AREA IN THAT. THEY HAVE AVAILABLE. FOR THE SAME THINGS THAT ARE BEIN PROPOSED IN THIS BILL AND I WOULD POINT OUT THAT THERE WAS LEGISLATION ON THIS BACK IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE JUST CHANGE THE WARNING LABELS FOR INSERT IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT INTERSTATE COMMERCE SO THE CHANGEOVER IS PROBLEMATIC JUST FOR A SENTENCE. AND IT'S ALREADY A VERY LONG CUMBERSOME -- ISSUE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE FOUNDATION THEY POINT OUT THAT YOU HATE IT IT SENDS THE WRONG SIGNAL WE HAVE VETERANS WHO WERE ARE PART OF THE TEAM EVALUATING THIS PROGRAM. IS THAT IT'S IT A POSTER. AND STICKERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT ARE FINE BUT IT SENDS THE WRONG MESSAGE WHAT. THE EFF CELLS IN THE RETAILER'S REALLY NEED IS TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE WARNING SIGNS OF SUICIDE. AND SO THEY'VE EMBARKED UPON A WHOLE TRAINING CAMPAIGN THEY HAVE VIDEOS THEY HAVE TRAINING TOOLS THEY HAVE. EARLY WARNING SIGNS OF WORKING WITH THE MEDICAL PROFESSION SO WE WOULD ASK THAT YOU. AYE I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S INTENT THAT YOU FIND A WAY TO SORT OF BLEND. BECAUSE ACTUALLY -- WHERE RETAILERS ARE ALREADY GETTING SOME OF THIS INFORMATION? IF WE COULD -- IF THEY'RE ALREADY PROVIDING IT THROUGH THIS PROGRAM WHICH IS WITH THE AMERICAN FOUNDATION FOR SUICIDE PREVENTION. THEN THAT -- ENCOMPASSES IT WE WOULD ALSO ASKS FOR SOME KIND OF FEES IN ON THE WARNING LABEL SO THE INVENTORY CAN BE DEALT WITH IF. THE WARNING PART GOES FORWARD SO WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR BUT WE HAVE A PROGRAM THAT ACTUALLY DOES MORE THAN THIS AND SO -- WE'RE VERY PLEASED ABOUT THAT AND WE'RE HAPPY TO PROVIDE I HAVE PROVIDED THE COMMITTEE. ON A WITH THAT INFORMATION AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS FOR THEIR WORK ON IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SEEING NONE -- AGAIN COMMON SIR. DO WE HAVE A MOTION [inaudible] OKAY. I'M ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE I LIVE JUST WANT TO SAY THAT -- CURRENTLY I'VE REPEAT WHAT I SAID ALREADY THERE'S NO. UPDATED INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT ANY POINT -- IN THE PROCESS OF OBTAINING A FIRE ARM WHEN I TALKED TO THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHOSE BROTHER OFFICER WHO WHOSE BROTHER WAS A VETERAN. HE SAID THAT IF AT ANY POINT DURING THIS. CRISIS IF HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE -- TO CALL SOMEBODY AND GET SOME HELP THAT -- IT BUT THERE WAS THE POTENTIAL THAT THIS SUICIDE WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED AND ON YES THIS IS NOT THE COMPLETE ANSWER TO THE MENTAL HEALTH OF CRISIS THAT WERE IN. BUT IF IT IS EFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING A SMALL NUMBER OF SUICIDES I THINK THAT -- IT DEFINITELY IS WORTH IT SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. AND I DO WANT TO HAVE TO ADD. ADD ONE OTHER THING WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. THIS IS FOR NEW SIGNS AND IT IS PRINTING THE WARNING ON EXISTING LABELS. OKAY. ALRIGHT SO THE MOTION IS -- TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS -- LET'S DO A ROLL CALL. SKINNER HI I'M MORE LACKEY BRADFORD. BRADFORD AYE JACKSON. AYE JACKSON AYE MITCHELL. MORALE. WIENER I MEAN HI.

OPAL IS LEAVING. SEE HOW IT IS -- I'M SORRY I'D LIKE BY [inaudible] PROPEL GREAT -- THIS IS ITEM EIGHT AB. THREE NINETY ONE YES YOU MAY PROCEED BETTER CHAIR YOU. COLLEAGUES I'D LIKE TO PRESENT TO YOU AB THREE NINETY ONE THAT ENABLES VEHICLE RENTAL COMPANIES TO REPORT THEFT AS VEHICLES BECOME OVER DO. RATHER THAN BEING REQUIRED TO WAIT FIVE DAYS AFTER THE VEHICLE RETURN. VEHICLE THEFT IS UNIQUE IN A SENSE AT ANY WASTED TIME IN THE REPORTING PROCESS ALLOWS THE CRIMINAL TO GEOGRAPHICALLY. FROM THE SEA. MOTIVATION FOR AUTOMOBILE THEFT IS HIGHER WHEN THERE IS A FIVE DAY GRACE. PERIOD GIVEN LEAVING PLENTY OF TIME TO FLEE THE SCENE AND DISMEMBER THE VEHICLE FOR THE SALE. WHEN FRAUD IS DISCOVERED IS IMPORTANT AT THE LAW ENFORCEMENT IS NOTIFIED IMMEDIATELY RATHER THAT WAITING UNTIL THE FIVE DAYS EXPIRE AFTER EXPIRATION OF THE RENTAL CAR LEASE? I AM ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE OF MAMMOTHS AND APPRECIATE THEM GREATLY. WITH THE AMENDMENTS THE FIVE DAY WAITING PERIOD WILL BE MINIMIZED SEVENTY TWO HOURS IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT PROPER PROCEDURES ARE CONDUCTED TO ENSURE BOTH SAFETY AND UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE RENTAL CAR AGENCY IN A RENTER OF THE VEHICLE. COLLEAGUES I ASK YOU TODAY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL THAT SIMPLY EXPEDITES IT IMPROVES THE SYSTEM OF TRACKING DOWN STOLEN CARS. BY LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. TIFFANY MATTHEWS ON HALF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. ANY OTHERS OKAY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IS [inaudible] FOR SIX OF MARCOS. ASSOCIATION -- WE OPPOSE AB -- THREE NINETY ONE I UNDERSTAND JUST FROM HEARING THE AUTHOR SPEAK THAT THERE'S A AN AMENDMENT THAT HE'S ACCEPTING AND IT'S GOING TO CHANGE THE TIME AND SO THE RIGHT AND THE COMMITTEE -- REQUESTED AN AMENDMENT THAT WOULD ALIGN THE BILL WITH THE CURRENT STATUTE A BILL BY A FORM OF FORMER BILL THAT'S NOW IN STATUTE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING WHICH ALLOWS. THE RENTAL CAR ENTITY TO IN EFFECT REMOTELY TURN ON THE GPS OF THE VEHICLE WITHIN SEVENTY TWO HOURS SO SINCE THAT'S ALREADY INTO A FACT -- WITHOUT IT THIS BILL OR NOT WE JUST ALIGNED IT WITH THAT STATUTE. AND WITH THIS BILL -- STILL REDUCE THE TIME PERIOD FROM FIVE DAYS TO FORTY EIGHT HOURS THE SEVENTY TWO HOURS TO THE SEVEN TWO EXACTLY THE SAME AS WHEN. THE RENTAL AGENCY CAN REMOTELY -- AN INITIATE THE GPS AT WITH IT ALSO BE THAT WOULD BE THE TIME PERIOD WITHIN WHICH THEY WOULD REPORT IT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT OR THE WOULD THAT STILL BE FORTY EIGHT HOURS NO.

TO YES SENATOR TAXI I THANK YOU FOR TAKING THAT AMENDMENTS CASSETTE CONCERN ME AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THERE'S A BALANCING THAT NEEDS TO GO ON HERE THERE'S A PRIVACY ISSUE. AND I THINK SEVENTY TWO HOURS IS AN APPROPRIATE LENGTH OF TIME BUT I THINK WITH ALL OF THESE KINDS OF MEASURES WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE. AND NOT ALLOW THE THUMB ON THE SCALE OF BALANCE.

FOURTEEN TWENTY THREE GRAND ITEM TWENTY ONE AB SIXTEEN FIFTY TWO WILL HEAR BOTH A AHEAD THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND FELLOW. MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE HERE I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK AND I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TODAY. UNDER CURRENT LAW ONCE A DECISION TO MAKE A A IS MADE TO TRANSFER A JUVENILE TO ADULT COURT. THEY MAY NOT BE REFERRED BACK TO THE JUVENILE SYSTEM. AND THIS CREATES SOME UNFAIR SITUATIONS AS WE LEARN MORE DYNAMICS OF THE CASE. THIS BILL BASICALLY -- PROVIDES A NARROWLY TAILORED REMEDY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE BY ESTABLISHING A PROCESS FOR JUVENILE TO REQUEST THE CRIMINAL COURT TO TRANSFER CASE TO JUVENILE COURT IN A LIMITED NUMBER OF SITUATIONS. WHERE THE BASIS FOR THE RITUAL TRANSFERS LATER DETERMINED TO BE INVALID? I THINK THIS IS A MUCH NEEDED MECHANISM TO ENSURE FAIRNESS AND ALLOW USED TO RECEIVE THE RESOURCES AND SERVICES THE SERVICES THEY NEED TO REHABILITATE. THEMSELVES IN THE JUVENILE SYSTEM. WE HAVE WORKED WITH THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION AND THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TODAY WILL REMOVE THEIR OPPOSITION. I WANT TO THANK OUR SPONSORS THE PACIFIC JUVENILE DEFENDER DEFENDER CENTER AND THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION. AND I WILL LET MY WITNESSES SELF INTRODUCE AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOU AYE VOTE -- WITNESSES YOU MAY PROCEED. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SUPER RAIL ON BEHALF OF THE PACIFIC JUVENILE DEFENDER CENTER. AB FOURTEEN TWENTY THREE ADDRESSES A GAP IN OUR LAWS THAT WAS IDENTIFIED IN COURT OF APPEAL CASE CALLED PEOPLE VERSUS SELF. IT WON'T AFFECT A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE BUT FOR THOSE THAT IT DOES AFFECT IT WILL BE LIFE CHANGING. IT ADDRESSES THE SITUATION WHEN THE PROMISE FOR ON WHICH A YOUNG PERSON WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE ADULT COURT. TURNS OUT NOT TO BE TRUE IN TERMS OF THE NATURE OF THE OFFENSE. USUALLY WHEN JUVENILE COURTS CONSIDER A TRANSFER DECISION THEY'RE WORKING FROM THE ARREST REPORT THAT WAS PREPARED SHORTLY AFTER THE INCIDENT OCCURRED. AND OFTEN TIMES WHEN -- IT TURNS OUT NOT TO BE ACCURATE OR NOT FULLY ACCURATE ONCE THE CASES BEEN FULLY INVESTIGATED BUT THAT ISN'T DISCOVERED UNTIL THE CASES IN ADULT COURT. SO -- A. B. FOURTEEN TWENTY THREE PROVIDES A THREE TIERED PROCESS FOR CERTAIN OF THE CASES WHERE THIS IS OCCURRED TO GO BACK TO JUVENILE COURT FOR DISPOSITION. ON IT HAS A ONE TIER IS FOR CASES WHICH IN WHICH THE CHILD IS FOUND GUILTY AT TRIAL OF ONLY A MISDEMEANOR IN ADULT COURT. AND AND THOSE ARE CASES WHERE THE WHERE THE YOUNG PERSON WOULDN'T HAVE EVEN BEEN ELIGIBLE FOR TRANSFER IF THAT'D BEEN KNOWN AT THE BEGINNING. THERE'S A SECOND TIER FOUR CASES WHERE YOUTH ARE TRIED IT OUT TRIED IN THE ADULT COURT AND FOUND GUILTY. OF A LESS SERIOUS FELONY OR A MISDEMEANOR INSTEAD OF THE VERY SERIOUS OFFENCE SEVEN OH SEVEN BE OFFENSE THEY WERE CHARGED WITH. ON AND THEN THE THIRD TIER AND THIS WILL BE MOST OF THE CASES CASES THAT ARE DISPOSED OF IN ADULT COURT BY PLEA BARGAIN -- WITH THE PROSECUTOR. IF THE PROSECUTOR AGREES THAT THE CASE CAN GO BACK TO JUVENILE COURT -- AND THE COURT EXERCISES ITS DISCRETION TO SEND THE CASE BACK THOSE CASES MAY BE SENT BACK TO JUVENILE COURT. THIS WHOLE BILL AFFECTS A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF YOUTH THERE ARE ONLY A HUNDRED NINETEEN CASES DISPOSED OF IN THE ADULT SYSTEM LAST YEAR OR FOR THE BIKE AND GET THE COULD SIT FOR TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE MOST RECENT DATA. AND OF THOSE ONLY A FEW YOUNG PEOPLE WOULD BE ELIGIBLE UNDER THIS BILL. BUT FOR THOSE WHO WOULD BE ELIGIBLE IT WOULD MAKE AN ENORMOUS DIFFERENCE BOTH TO THAT YOUNG PERSON AND TO THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE. AND ARTHUR BUT WE WILL TALK ABOUT WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT X. WITNESS. THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING MADAM SECRETARY AT I'M SORRY. TO THAT EVERY TIME. RENDON CHEVRON AND DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ART THE BOISE -- AND ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION WE ARE PROUD TO SPUR COSPONSORED IS VERY NECESSARY A LEGISLATION ARJUN AYE VOTE. ON THE BILL. BUT JUST TO ADD TO WHAT'S ALREADY HAVE BEEN SAID -- AN OFFER HERE TODAY ON A. B. FOURTEEN TWENTY THREE WE LIKE TO CONSIDER -- THE SHORT AND LONG TERM BENEFIT TO MINORS THAT ARE TARGETED BY THE BILL AND TO THE COMMUNITIES FROM WHICH THEY COME FROM AND THE TO THE LARGEST -- CHILDREN RETURNING BACK TO JUVENILE COURT. COURT JURISDICTION WILL RECEIVE TREATMENT AND REHABILITATION SERVICES THAT THEY THAT THEY IN MOST CASES FOR NOT RECEIVE IN A COURT OF CRIMINAL JURISDICTION -- THESE MINERS WILL BE. HELD ACCOUNTABLE -- HOWEVER WITH REAL BILL ATTENTION AS THE GOAL AS OPPOSED TO SIMPLY PUNISHMENT. BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE QUALIFYING OFFENSES AS AS MISS PEARL POINTED OUT. BOB THE REFERRAL BACK TO JUVENILE COURT THESE NINE SERIES NON VIOLENT FELONY OFFENSES MISDEMEANORS -- APPOINT SATISFACTORY COMPLETION OF APPEAR TO PROBATION IN THESE CASES THESE MINERS WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THE RECORDS IMMEDIATELY SEALED HICH WILL BENEFIT THE MEMBERS SO EMPLOYMENT. EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND HOUSING JUST TO NAME A FEW OF BENEFITS OF THAT AND TO AVOID MANY OF THE COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES OF A CRIMINAL CONVICTION. WELL -- WHICH IS GOOD FOR THE MINOR AND THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE. MORAL MORE OVER THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS A MUCH BETTER IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION TO WORK WITH MINORS EVEN THOSE THAT ARE AT THE END OF THEIR TEENAGE YEARS. MORE SO THAN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. I WOULD ALSO LIKE THOSE -- SAY AGAIN THANK TO TO THE COMMITTEE FOR THE HARD WORK TO SPENT ON ON THIS BILL AND WE ARE CHEN I'D VOTE ON A ON A BE. FOURTEEN TWENTY THREE BUT OUR LET'S SEE IF THERE'S OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. AT THE SHORE ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT.

SENATE JACKSON YEAH I'M I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL WE ARE REALLY TRYING TO DO REFORM ON OUR SYSTEM I JUST HOPE THAT WE INVEST THE RESOURCES WE NEED TO TO MAKE THESE PROGRAMS WORK. AS WE MOVE CRIMINAL JUSTICE AWAY FROM EXCUSE ME JUVENILE JUSTICE INTO A NEW DEPARTMENT -- TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUES OF DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS FOR REHABILITATION ALL THE THINGS THAT I THINK. MANY OF US TO VOTE FOR THESE BILLS WANT TO SEE HAPPEN. BUT WITHOUT THE RESOURCES IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN SO -- INVESTING IN EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION. AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS ALL THE THINGS THAT WE KNOW ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO HELP OUR USE. IF WE DON'T HAVE THEM OUT THERE WE'RE GOING TO FIND THAT THESE EFFORTS WERE MAKING TO REALLY GIVE THEM A SECOND CHANCE. THE PUBLIC HAS SPOKEN STAND FORD IF IF WE IF WE DON'T SEE RESULTS SO I APPRECIATE THIS BILL I'M HAPPY TO MOVE IT I JUST THINK WE HAVE TO BE COGNIZANT OF MAKING PROMISES AND WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THEM. SO A THANK YOU FOR THIS AND AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL MADAM CHAIR. RIGHT SO WE HAVE A MOTION -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE EXCELLENT LET'S TAKE A ROLL CALL IN THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS.

BOOK KEEP THE BILL ON CALL AND WE CAN GO TO OUR NEXT ITEM WHICH IS ITEM TWENTY ONE A. B.. SIXTEEN FIFTY TWO THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HELLO AGAIN -- AB SIXTEEN FIFTY TWO WILLOW COURTS REQUIRE AN ALTERNATIVE COMMUNITY SERVICE OPTION OTHER THAN LITTER PICK UP IN A PERSONS CONVICTED LITTERING. AND A BODY OF WATER AND THE INTENT OF THIS BILLS PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY AMONG COURTS.

RIGHT ANY -- WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION -- COLLEAGUES. TO HAVE A MOTION. NO QUESTIONS. WELL. YEAH GO AHEAD SENATOR JACKSON'S STUFF HERE THIS IS -- I RECOGNIZE TONIGHT LIKE SUPPORT THIS TO THE EXTENT I'M NOT. DESPERATELY OPPOSED TO THE NOTION BUT I KNOW THAT WHEN WE'VE HAD -- A PEOPLE WHO -- COMMIT. A PARTICULAR TYPE OF OFFENSE. DAD WHEN THEY ARE REQUIRED AS A CONDITION OF PROBATION TO DIVE RIGHT INTO. THE IMPACTS OF THAT BEHAVIOR -- IT TENDS TO MAKE A VERY STRONG STATEMENT TO AN IMPRESSION ON THEM I THINK OF GRAFFITI. WHEN YOU HAVE USE HAVING TO CLEAN UP THE GRAFFITI THEY'VE CREATED THEY REALIZE HER DIRECTLY THE SIGNIFICANCE AND A TAD SO -- I CAN -- I KNOW THE COMMUNITY SERVICE IS -- IS -- IMPORTANT TO TO KIND OF GET PEOPLE TO RECOGNIZE THE IMPACTS OF THEIR BEHAVIOR -- AND IN SUPPORT THIS I JUST THINK THAT. MAKING THE PUNISHMENT IF YOU WILL. RELEVANT TO THE THE ACTUAL ACTION WHICH RESULTS IN THE PROBATIONARY IMPOSITION IS IS VERY VERY HELPFUL SO -- I KNOW THAT THERE AREN'T ALWAYS EXAMPLES WHERE WE CAN DO THIS BUT I JUST THINK. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT IF WE WANT TO HAVE THE IMPACTS WERE LOOKING FOR SURE AND AND I AGREE WITH THAT AND I THINK WHAT THIS THE GOAL THIS BILLS TO PROVIDE ALTERNATIVES FOR INSTANCE OF SOMEONE. LEADERS -- BUT THERE DISABLED IN THE PHYSICALLY HAVE CHALLENGES IT GIVES THE JUDGE SOME ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS -- TO TO WORK WITH. PART WE HAVE A MOTION. DO YOU LIKE TO CLOSE RESPECT FAST RIVA OKAY LET'S DO A ROLL CALL THIS MOTION IS. JUST TO PASS TO THE FLOOR. SKINNER BY SKINNER AYE MORE LOCK. MOORLACH AYE BRADFORD BRADFORD AYE JACKSON. JACKSON AYE MITCHELL. MITCHELL AYE WIENER AYE WIENER AYE. THE BILL WILL BE ON CALL SINCE WE ARE MISSING MEMBER. AND WE WILL GO NOW TO THANK YOU SO MUCH WE WILL NOW GO TO ITEM TWO AB. SIXTY FOUR ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING SIXTY ONE AB SIXTY ONE ITEM. TO HE MAY PERCENT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FIRST IMAGES THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR HARD WORK AND CAN I START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO SET THE BILL TO NOT START TILL SEPTEMBER FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TO GIVE JUDICIAL COUNCIL TIME TO FOLLOW THEIR PROCEDURAL CALENDARS -- AS YOU KNOW AB SIXTY ONE EXPAND YOUR PREVIOUS LAW MADAM CHAIR WHICH IS TO EXPAND. THE PEOPLE WHO CAN USE A GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER -- CURRENTLY ONLY -- FAMILY MEMBERS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN USE A GUN BONTA STRAINING ORDER WERE PROPOSING TO EXPAND IT TO EMPLOYERS COWORKERS EMPLOYEES OF A HIGH SCHOOL OR COLLEGE -- AND WE TIGHTENED THE BILL IN ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SAFETY SO THAT THERE'S A SET -- CODIFICATION AROUND HOW MUCH INTERACTION THE INDIVIDUALS I HAD BEFORE THE ISSUE A GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS. AS YOU KNOW -- EVERYBODY HAS A RIGHT TO GO TO SCHOOL AND TO WORK WITHOUT FEARING FOR THEIR LIFE WE THINK THIS IS A TOOL. THAT THOSE FOLKS CAN USE IN THESE TYPES OF SITUATIONS AND UNFORTUNATELY SEEN WAY TOO MANY MASS SHOOTINGS OCCUR IN WORKPLACES AS WELL AS SCHOOLS. SO WITH THAT WERE RESPECTFULLY ASKING FOR YOUR VOTE ON A. B.. SIXTY ONE RIGHT WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. CALVIN CREEK ON BEHALF OF BAY AREA STUDENT ACTIVISTS -- WERE WE ARE IN SUPPORT AND SO I THINK MY FIRST POINT IS THAT. COM I PERSONALLY KNOW AS A STUDENT THAT MANY PEOPLE SEE THEIR TEACHERS OR OTHERWISE THEIR CO WORKERS THEIR EMPLOYER. A LOT MORE SOMETIMES THAN THE TO THEIR FAMILY ESPECIALLY IF THEY HAVE A DIFFICULT SITUATION. AT HOME AND SO THOSE PEOPLE SOMETIMES NO BETTER THAN A FAMILY WHEN THAT PERSON IS AT RISK WHEN THEY CAN FEEL THREATENED WHEN THEY'RE ACTING ERRATICALLY FOR EXAMPLE -- AND IS ONE EXAMPLE OF COURSE -- I BRING THIS UP EVERY TIME WE TALK ABOUT THIS BILL IS THAT AT THE PARKING SHOOTING FRIENDS AND TEACHERS KNEW THE SHOOTER HAD AN OBSESSION WITH GUNS. THAT THE SHOOTER HELD RACIST HOMOPHOBIC ANTI SEMITIC AND XENOPHOBIC VIEWS. AND HAD EVEN STATED. BEFORE THE ATTACK I AM GOING TO BE A PROFESSIONAL SCHOOL FUTURE. AND SO LAW ENFORCEMENT FAILED TO ACT TO MOVE HIS GUNS THE FROM HIS POSSESSION. AND YET -- IF HIS TEACHERS WHO KNEW HIM HAD BEEN ABLE TO PETITION THE COURT. FOR HIS GUNS BECAUSE THIS CREATED THAT TRAGEDY MIGHT HAVE BEEN AVERTED. AND I THINK IT'S ALSO BEEN THE THERE ARE OTHER EXAMPLES THE SHOOTING EARLIER THIS YEAR IN AURORA. ILLINOIS IS ANOTHER ONE WHERE BACKGROUND CHECKS FAILED AND THAN EMPLOYEE WHO HAD JUST BEEN DISMISSED -- PULLED OUT A GUN IN HIS WORKPLACE. AND SHOT FIVE PEOPLE. AND SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT OVER FIVE HUNDRED WORKPLACE HOMICIDES OCCUR EVERY YEAR AND FIREARMS ARE USED IN OF THOSE CASES. AND THAT MIGHT MY SECOND POINT IS THAT [inaudible] PHONE. HELLO THE BIGGEST CAUSE OF GUN BY OF GUN DEATHS IN THIS -- IN THIS COUNTRY IS SUICIDE OVER TWO THIRDS OF ALL COME WITH A TO DEATH ARE SUICIDES -- WITH OVER THOUSANDS OF THOSE BY CHILDREN AND TEENS EVERY YEAR. AND WHILE WELL OVER 90% OF SUICIDE ATTEMPTS ARE UNSUCCESSFUL WHEN THE MEASURE THAT DOES NOT INVOLVE A FIREARM. FIREARM RESULT IN DEATH. GUNS FACILITATE SUICIDE AND IT STANDS TO REASON THEN THAT IT HE WAY TO PREVENT SUICIDES IS TO MAKE SURE THAT A SUICIDAL PERSON DOES NOT HAVE A GUN. AT THEIR DISPOSAL SUICIDAL PEOPLE NEEDED HELP. NEED HELP TO FEEL THAT THEY HAVE A PURPOSE IN THE WORLD THEY NEED THEIR FAMILY THEIR CO WORKERS THE TEACHERS TO SPEAK UP AND TO ACTIVELY GET INVOLVED. IN ORDER TO PROTECT THEIR LIVES AND SO. AGAIN WHILE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AROUND THE STATE CONTINUE. TO WORK ON IMPLEMENTING THE DVR -- BELL -- IT'S BEEN UNEVEN SO FAR THERE ARE OTHER BILLS TO ADDRESS THAT BUT WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT EMPLOYERS CO WORKERS AND TEACHERS PEOPLE TO ACT DIRECTLY AND GO DIRECTLY TO A COURT. TO PROTECT THE SAFETY OF THEIR SCHOOLS THEIR WORK PLACES AND THEIR STUDENTS.

THINK THEY'RE SOME OF THE MIKE THERE GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ELIZABETH ESPINOSA HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN THE COUNTY OF VENTURA WHICH YOU ARE WELL AWARE WAS THE SIDE OF THE BORDER LINE SHOOTING LAST NOVEMBER. A TRAGIC EVENT THE REALLY SHATTER THE COMMUNITY AND THE BOARD IS LOOKING TO SUPPORT WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN KEEP FIREARMS. OUT OF THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO ARE COULD BE AT RISK OF HARMING THEMSELVES OR OTHERS WE THINK MISTER TING FOR THIS BILL. HI KATHY BURKE WITH THE HEALTH OFFICER'S ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING DANIEL KENDALL BECAUSE OUR BEHALF OF THE GIFFORDS LAW CENTER TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE IN STRONG SUPPORT. TIFFANY MATTHEWS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. BRIDGET SIR RALLY ON BEHALF OF RISING SCHOLARS AT CAL STATE LONG BEACH IN SUPPORT. PART OF THEIR ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. WE'LL HAVE TO AT THE TABLE IN THE OTHERS CAN BE AT THE MIKE. AND THERE'S TWO SPOTS RIGHT THERE [inaudible] RED. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS KATHY SURE FOR THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA. AB SIXTY ONE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDS THE CLASS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE AUTHORIZED TO SEEK EX PARTE GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS AND WE REMAIN CONCERNED THAT THIS WILL MAKE THE SYSTEM PRONE TO ABUSE. THE AMENDMENTS REQUIRE THAT IF A CO WORKERS PETITIONING FOR A G. B. RO THEY MUST HAVE HAD SUBSTANTIAL INTERACTIONS WITH THE PERSON THEY MUST HAVE THE APPROVAL OF THE EMPLOYER. BUT THIS DOES LITTLE TO PREVENT SOMEONE FROM ACTING OUT OF IRRATIONAL FEARS OR BIASED DUE TO A CO WORKERS RACE OR RELIGION OR NATURAL NATIONAL ORIGIN OR FROM RETALIATION. BECAUSE JUST AS THE CO WORKER MIGHT BE ACTING OUT OF BIAS AN EMPLOYER MIGHT WORK SIGN OFF ON SUCH A REQUEST OUT OF BIAS -- THE BILL ALSO AS AMENDED ALSO REQUIRES THAT IF A SCHOOL EMPLOYEE IS PETITIONING FOR A G. B. R. O. THEY OBTAIN APPROVAL OF THIS SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION. FOR SIMILAR REASONS THIS DOES LITTLE TO ADDRESS THE CONCERN THE PETITIONS WILL BE FILED IN A DISCRIMINATORY MANNER. ADDITIONALLY THE PROJECT RATIONALE FOR AN EX PARTE ORDER IS THE ALLEGED URGENCY OF THE THREAT YET THIS BILL ALLOWS A SCHOOL EMPLOYEE TO SEEK AN EX PARTE ORDER EVEN IF THEY HAVEN'T SEEN THE STUDENT FOR SIX MONTHS. THIS TIME FRAME IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE SUPPOSED URGENCY OF THE ORDER. WHEN SOMEONE IS SUBJECT TO AN EX PARTE ORDER THEY DO NOT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEFEND THEMSELVES OR PRESENT THEIR SIDE BEFORE THE ORDER IS CRACKED CARRIED OUT? THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT A G. B. R. O. HAS BEEN APPROVED UNTIL AN OFFICER SHOWS UP AT THEIR DOOR AND ORDERS THEM TO SURRENDER THEIR FIREARMS. THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT BEEN ACCUSED OF MAKING CRIMINAL THREATS OR COMMITTING ANY CRIME WHATSOEVER THEY MAY NOT EVEN HAVE FIREARMS. BUT WE ARE CONCERNED WITH THE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES OF AN OFFICER SHOWING UP IN A PERSONS HOME EXPECTING TO FIND SOMEONE WHO IS ARMED AND DANGEROUS EVEN WHEN IN FACT THEY ARE NEITHER. FINALLY AS GOVERNOR BROWN NOTED IN HIS VETO MESSAGE OF THE SAME BILL LAST YEAR. EVERYONE IN THIS BILL CAN ALREADY SEEK EX PARTE ORDERS BY WORKING WITH THE POLICE OR THE FAMILY OF THE INDIVIDUALS I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT. MORE CALIFORNIA TOO OLD HAVE APPLIED IN THE PARKLAND SHOOTING -- THE TEACHERS AND STUDENTS WHO ARE CONCERNED COULD HAVE GONE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ASKED FOR THEM -- TO GET TV RO -- IN THAT CASE. PREVENTING GUN VIOLENCE IS OF COURSE OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE BUT WE MUST ENSURE THAT OUR EFFORTS TO DO THIS DO NOT ON UNNECESSARILY COMPROMISED CIVIL LIBERTIES -- UNFORTUNATELY AB SIXTY ONE FAILS TO ACHIEVE THIS BALANCE AND FOR THIS REASON WE REMAIN IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT NEXT WITNESS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR THE RECORD AND WE WOULD NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE ACLU -- SHE DROVE BY MOST OF THE POINTS HOME AND I JUST WANT. TO REITERATE THAT GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS OR SHOULD BE INTO PEOPLE HAVE NOT BEEN CONVICTED OF A CRIME OR JUDICATA MENTALLY ILL THESE ARE BASED ON THIRD PARTY ALLEGATIONS. AND THIS BILL'S GOING TO EXPAND THAT THE CLASS OF PEOPLE THEY CAN BRING THESE AND OURS WAS COMMENTED EARLIER THIS CAN ALREADY BE DONE THROUGH LAW ENFORCEMENT AT THIS TIME. LET'S NOT FORGET THE GE AROSE DO NOT ADDRESS ANY OTHER ELEMENT OF DANGEROUS NYSSA PERSON -- MAY POSE IN IT DOESN'T PROVIDE ANY MENTAL HEALTH ASSISTANCE AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD REALLY BE FOCUSING ON FOR THAT MANY OTHER REASONS WERE STAND IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MADAM CHAIR ROY GRIFFIS BEGIN I'LL BE UP THE CALIFORNIA RIFLE AND PISTOL ASSOCIATION WEREN'T STRONG OPPOSITION ALSO THIRTY TWO YEARS RETIRED LAW ENFORCEMENT THERE'S NO BETTER NON BIASED GATEKEEPER THAN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. AND NO BETTER PEOPLE THAN IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS TO KNOW THESE PEOPLE'S NEEDS SO WE STAND STRONG OPPOSITION THANK YOU MANAGER. MANAGER MEMBERS SAMPRAS REPRESENTING GUNNELS CALIFORNIANS STRONG OPPOSITION THANK YOU. MANY HIGHER FROM THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL LIBERTIES ADVOCACY I'D LIKE TO ECHO THE SENTIMENTS OF THE ACLU AND ALSO -- I'M SORRY BUT YOUR ORGANIZATION'S NAME. IN OUR A YES. I THOUGHT I THOUGHT IT WAS CAL GUNS FOR SOME REASON I'M SORRY -- BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT -- I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT TO IS WERE CONCERNED ABOUT FOURTH AMENDMENT SEARCHES -- IF SOMEONE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE ANY GUNS SUCH AS WHAT HAPPENED A PARK WHEN SHOOTING SURVIVOR DAVID HOG HE WAS ONCE WANTED -- SOMEONE CALLED THE COPS ON HIM AND HE WASN'T HOME BUT IN OTHER INCIDENCES PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SHOT. BUT EVEN IF SOMEONE DOESN'T HAVE ANY GUNS ANYTHING THAT -- IN THEIR HOME WOULD BECOME DISCOVERABLE AND SUBJECT -- TO RESEARCH AND SO THAT'S ANOTHER PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE WITH THIS BILL SO WE STAND IN STRONG OPPOSITION. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ALL RIGHT DISCUSSION BY. OF MY COLLEAGUES. GO AHEAD SENATOR JEFF. THANK YOU -- COULD YOU RESPOND TO THE CONCERNS. THAT WE COULD SEE -- POTENTIALLY -- POTENTIAL ABUSES BY PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE IT OUT FOR SOMEONE. LEVELS OF DISCRIMINATION BASED ON RACE ETHNICITY. IMMIGRATION STATUS HOW HOW DO YOU ADDRESS THAT IN THIS. BILL BECAUSE IT SUPPORT WHAT YOU TRYING TO GET AT JUST INTERESTED IN HOW YOU GOING TO DEAL. WITH THE POSSIBILITIES THAT THIS COULD BE ABUSED BY PEOPLE OF ILL INTENT. BACK TO THE CORNERS -- QUESTION SENATOR AS YOU RECALL SINCE -- YOURSELF AND CENTER SKINNER CARRY THE ORIGINAL BILL THE ORIGINAL BILL WAS ARE THE MAIN ARGUMENT AGAINST THE BILL WAS THAT WE WOULD SEE RAMPANT USE OF THIS -- THESE TV ARE OWES THAT WE WOULD HAVE. THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF GUN TAKE A GUNS TAKEN AWAY IN FACT IN THREE YEARS THERE'S ONLY BEEN UP APPROXIMATELY SIX HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN G. V. R. O. C. ISSUED IN THE ENTIRE STATE. MUCH OF THE MID THE MAJORITY BUT A GREAT NUMBER HAVE BEEN ISSUED BY THE SAN DIEGO CITY ATTORNEY MAR ELLIOTT -- IN FACT MANY OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE HAVEN'T EVEN IMPLEMENTED POLICIES -- TO TO USE GPRS IN FACT AND I'M ASHAMED THAT MY OWN COUNTY SAN FRANCISCO AS WELL AS SAN MATTEO COUNTY I DON'T BELIEVE A SINGLE DVR HAS BEEN ISSUED OR IF THEY HAVE I THINK IT'S UNDER I THINK IT'S ONE RIGHT THANK YOU. ONE BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTIES -- AND SO I THINK THIS IS WHERE THIS WAS A TOOL THAT -- I BELIEVE OUR BODY -- PROVIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT -- THEY HAVE FOR WHATEVER REASON -- NOT BEEN ABLE TO USE IT -- TO CHOSEN NOT TO USE IT WE'RE NOT GOING TO SPECULATE. BUT THIS ALLOWS -- THE PEOPLE WHO WERE ACTUALLY UNDER THREAT OF BEING BEING SHOT TO TAKE THE POWER INTO THEIR OWN HANDS. TO ENSURE THAT THEIR WORK PLACE IS SAFE AND THAT THEIR SCHOOLS ARE SAFE IN TERMS OF BIASES. YOU HAVE A YOU HAVE TO GO GET THE G. R. O. FROM A JUDGE I WOULD HOPE THE JUDGE WOULD -- TO QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS ANY PARTICULAR BIAS AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME WITH THE USE THAT JUDICIAL. G. JUDICIAL RESTRAINT TO ENSURE THAT THERE ISN'T ANY BIAS. AT THIS POINT WE HAVE NOT SEEN LARGE NUMBERS OF DVR OWES ISSUED IN THE STATE. HEATHER -- JUSTIFY CAN RESPOND PLEASE THE TO FACT TWO FACTORS THAT WERE DESIGNED IN THE ORIGINAL BILL WHICH HAS NOT BEEN MODIFIED SERVICE IN STATUTE RIGHT NOW. TO HELP MINIMIZE ABUSES WAS AT THAT THEIR HOUSE YOU HAVE TO IN. PETITIONING FOR THE G. VERO SHOW A DEMONSTRATED -- PROOF OF THE PERSON BEING THREATENING VIOLENCE TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS SECONDARILY IT IS A MISDEMEANOR. IF YOU HAVE FILED A PETITION. KNOWING THE INFORMATION IN THE PETITION IS FALSE OR WITH THE INTENT TO HARASS OR OTHER -- OTHER -- ITEMS WHICH THEN IS A MISDEMEANOR WITH A FINE SO IT IS BUILT INTO THE LAW TO IN EFFECT -- HAVE CONSEQUENCES TO ANYONE WHO USES THIS FOR A REASON OTHER THAN THE INTENT OF THE LAW. SO THAT AND THAT WAS REALLY WHAT I WAS GETTING I APPRECIATE THE THE AUTHOR OF THE ORIGINAL BILL CLARIFYING DISTANCE BILL ALSO CONTAINED. THOSE CAUTIONARY PRINCIPLES SO THAT THE MODIFICATION TO THE PENAL CODE WHERE THE G. P. R. O. S. ESTABLISHED SO IT WOULD ALL PLAY INCLUDING SUPPLY THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT -- ANY OTHER COMMENTS HER. WE HAVE A MOTION. GREAT AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER TEAM WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THIS IS PERFECT FOR ABOUT A NAY BE SIXTY ONE THANK YOU. OKAY -- ALL RIGHT WITH THAT WILL DO ROLL CALL IN THIS BILL IS. DO PASS AS AMENDED. AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS. SKINNER HI SKINNER AYE MOORLACH BRADFORD. JACKSON AYE JACKSON AYE MITCHELL MITCHELL I'M AROUND WIENER. BY BILL BE ON CALL UNTIL ARE ABSENT MEMBERS RETURN THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER TING. AND WILL NOW GO -- TO ITEM I'M NOT MR RUN CASES HERE. APOLOGIES MS WEBER YOU'VE BEEN WAITING BUT WOOD MISTER ROGERS HERE WE DO FILE ORDER SO WE'LL GO TO ITEM NUMBER SIX AB THREE OH THREE ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- I AM I HERE TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL THREE OH THREE TODAY SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATORS ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF COMMITTING A SEXUAL VIOLENT OFFENSE. AND WHO HAD BEEN AFTER BEING EVALUATED BY MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL THE COURT FINDS PROBABLE CAUSE A HERE SHE WOULD ENGAGED IN SEXUALLY VIOLENT ACTS UPON RELEASE. I WENT TO COURT FINES ARE PROBABLE CAUSE A FULL TRIAL MUST BE HELD TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE S. V. P. SHOULD BE COMMITTED TO STATE CUSTODY EVEN AFTER SERVING HIS OR HER CRIMINAL SENTENCE. HOWEVER THERE IS CURRENTLY LITTLE STATUTORY GUIDANCE ABOUT THE PROCEDURES FOR A COURT TO ISSUE TROUT CONTINUANCE OR A DELAY IN BEGINNING A TRIAL THIS LACK OF GUIDANCE IS PROBLEMATIC FOR TWO REASONS. FIRST IT CAN LEAD TO OVERLY LOGGING CONSTITUTIONALLY PROBLEMATIC DELAYS IN BEGINNING A TRIAL FOR INSTANCE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN A LOS ANGELES COURT RELEASED AN INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS AWAITING TRIAL FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS. SECOND THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT FOR THE PARTY REQUESTING A CONTINUANCE TO PROVIDE JUSTIFICATION OR FOR THE COURT TO JUSTIFY ITS DECISION TO ISSUE. ONE THIS CAN LEAVE APPELLATE COURTS WITH AN INCOMPLETE RECORD TO LATER EXAMINE WHETHER CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATIONS OCCURRED. ASSEMBLY BILL THREE OH THREE WILL ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BY FINALLY PROVIDING STATUTORY GUIDANCE ON THE PROCEDURE FOR ISSUING. A CONTINUE ONCE IN A SB P. TRIAL. THESE PROCEDURES INCLUDE A REQUIREMENT THAT A MOTION FOR CONTINUANCE BE MADE IN WRITING. A REQUIREMENT THAT A CONTINUANCE BE GRANTED ONLY UPON GOOD BECAUSE AND IF THE CONTINUANCES GRANTED A REQUIREMENT THAT THE COURT PROVIDES A JUSTIFICATION FOR ITS DECISION ON THE RECORD. THIS BILL WILL KEEP OUR COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA SAFE BY HELPING TO PREVENT THE RELEASE A SEXUALLY VIOLENT. PREDATORS THAT WITHOUT A TRIAL. IT WILL ALSO HELP ENSURE THAT CONTINUANCES ARE GRANTED WITH SUFFICIENT JUSTIFICATION AND THAT THERE IS A SUFFICIENT RIGHT -- FOR APPELLATE COURTS TO EXAMINE DOWN THE LINE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A JUDICIAL CONCERN I THAT THEY HAVE REYES ABOUT THE PROCEDURES OUTLINED IN THIS BILL FOR WORKING VERY CLOSE TO FINALIZING AN AGREEMENT ON THE AMENDMENTS. HI THERE WE HOPE TO ADDRESS -- IN THE IN THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS SAID THAT SHOULD THIS BILL CONTINUE MOVING FORWARD SENATORS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE TODAY ON AB THREE OH THREE WITH ME TO TESTIFY ARE THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL -- IN SUPPORT IS TOMAR TOKAT NJ GROPES IN WITH THE LOS ANGELES DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. MAY PROCEED THANK YOU GOOD MORNING -- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS TO MARTEL CAUGHT ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WE'RE PLEASED TO BE SPONSORING THIS IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION. A LENGTHY DELAYS AND SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATOR CASES IS A STATE BY PROBLEM THAT WERE HOPING IT. WILL BE REMEDIED BY THIS BILL BY ESTABLISHING CLEAR GUIDELINES AND PROCEDURES FOR COURTS. TO FOLLOW IN GRANTING CONTINUANCES IN THESE CASES WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND I HAVE WITH ME -- THE DEPUTY IN CHARGE OF OUR OFFICES SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATOR UNIT JAKE ROBINSON THANK YOU. BOARDING THE HEAD OR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] AS OF AS OF MARCH OF THIS YEAR THERE WERE FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT PEOPLE HELD A COLIN THE STATE HOSPITAL PENDING TRIAL. THAT'S REDUCTION FROM AUGUST OF LAST YEAR WHEN THEY WERE FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS A LARGE STAKEHOLDER WE HAVE THE MOST INDIVIDUALS THERE OF THAT FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED AND TEN FROM LOS ANGELES COUNTY. I AM HAPPY TO SAY THAT TWO WEEKS AGO WE WERE FINALLY ABLE TO BRING TO TRIAL OUR LAST CASE FROM THE NINETEEN NINETIES. BUT THAT REMAINS OVER A HUNDRED CASES FROM LOS ANGELES COUNTY. TWENTY FIVE OF THOSE ARE OVER TEN YEARS OLD. THE GEORGE VASQUEZ CASE AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CERVANTES REFERENCED SEVENTEEN YEARS. THE PROBLEM HOWEVER IS NOT UNIQUE TO LOS ANGELES I SPOKE WITH COLLEAGUES IN OTHER COUNTIES WHO HAVE SIMILAR FRUSTRATIONS OVER THE INABILITY TO BRING THESE CASES TO TRIAL. JUST TWO WEEKS AGO THE COURT OF APPEAL UPHELD THE DISMISSAL OF THE PETITION FOR MISTER CLAY JONES. MISTER JONES WAS FILED ON BY SACRAMENTO COUNTY DA'S OFFICE AS SEXUAL VIOLENT PREDATOR IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN HE SOUGHT A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS. BECAUSE OF DELAYS IN BRINGING HIS CASE TO TRIAL. THE APPELLATE COURT UPHELD THE DISMISSAL OF THE CASE NOTING THERE WERE OVER TEN YEARS OF DELAYS. AND PERHAPS ITS MOST SIGNIFICANT FOR OUR PURPOSES IS THAT THE TRIAL COURT A CONDUCTING THE HEARING SPECIFICALLY SAID. THAT TWO OF HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS THE PROSECUTION AND THE COURT CONTRIBUTED TO THE NUMEROUS DELAYS. BY NOT DEMONSTRATING GOOD CAUSE NOR INSISTING UPON OF SHOWING A GOOD BECAUSE WHEN GRANTING CONTINUANCES. AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT AB THREE OH THREE IS DESIGNED TO DO REQUIRED THAT THERE BE SOME GOOD COST FOUND TO CONTINUE TRIALS IN THIS PETITIONS. SO YOU DO NOT HAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO SET THEIR LANGUISHING FOR FIVE EIGHT TEN FIFTEEN YEARS WITHOUT HAVING A TRIAL ON THE MERITS OF THE PETITION. I THANK YOU. THANK YOU LET'S SEE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS RAINY PERIOD WE HAVE FOR THIS HAMMER DINO SHARE SOME PLEASE BENEVOLENT ASSOCIATION AND POOR I CAN SUPPORT.

LIKE THIS IT STARTS TO MAKE SENSE WHY THESE CASES ARE NOT GOING FORWARD WHY THEY'RE NOT EVEN MAKING IT TO THE DA'S OFFICE. THERE ARE PROBLEMS IN THE SYSTEM IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS BILL IS A GREAT WAY TO RECTIFY THAT BECAUSE WHY SHOULD ANYONE REPORT A CRIME. IF I WENT TO A SEVEN OUR BRAVE CAT. AND THEN NO NEVER FOLLOWED UP WITH ME. AND I HAD TO TALK TO THE CHIEF OF POLICE THOSE WORKING WITH AS A NEXT DOOR STAFFER COLLABORATING THE SECOND POLICE.

PLEASE OFFICE SHOULD NEVER TAKE A HUMAN LIFE WHEN THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES. SB THREE NINE TWO IS ABOUT PREVENTING UNNECESSARY DEATHS BY CLARIFYING LAW ENFORCEMENT'S OBLIGATION WHEN MAKING THE DECISION TO USE DEADLY FORCE.

INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND IS MODELED AFTER POLICIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN PLACE AT SEVERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AROUND THE COUNTRY.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME IT PLEASE VOTE YES ON AB THREE DIED TOO THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS. TO TALK ABOUT SOMEONE IMPORTANT TO US WHO'VE LOST. CAN WE HAVE THE NEXT WITNESS IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS JANUARY'S. ANDA I AM HERE -- WITH THE STOP COALITION. THIS PAST WEEK MARK SEVEN YEARS SINCE MY BROTHER CHARLIE SALINAS WAS KILLED BY SINGLE POLICE. A BLOCK AWAY FROM MY CHILDHOOD HOME. THE SEVEN YEARS HAVE BEEN FILLED WITH TRAUMA CONFUSION IN JUSTICE BUT NOW FINALLY HOPE FOR CHANGE. MY LITTLE BROTHER WAS A GOOD AND GENTLE MAN. HE LOVES SPORTS MARINE TENNIS FAMILY WOULD ALSO A VETERAN WHO STRUGGLED WITH DEPRESSION. POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER ON THE DAY HE WAS KILLED CHARLIE AND CALL 911- ON HIMSELF AND TOLD A DISPATCHER THAT HE WANTED TO DIE. HE WAS EXPERIENCING A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS HE NEEDED HELP. INSTEAD OF POLICE WHO ARRIVED FIRED TWENTY TWO BULLETS AT HIM. ONE CHARLIE WAS SHOT HIS HANDS WERE IN THE AIR HE WAS FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS BUT NON DEADLY OPTIONS WERE NOT PURSUED. WHAT IS CALIFORNIA ALLOW PEOPLE TO KILL PEOPLE? WHEN IT'S NOT NECESSARY TO PROTECT FROM AN IMMINENT THREAT? CHARLIE WAS NO THREAT THAT DAY. FOR FARTOO LONG CALIFORNIA HAS IGNORE THE PROBLEM OF POLICE SHOOTINGS AND THE DISPROPORTIONATE KILLING THE BLACK AND LATINO CALIFORNIANS AND THOSE WITH DISABILITIES. AB THREE NINETY TWO FINALLY ADDRESSES THIS PROBLEM HEAD ON WITH SOLUTIONS THAT WE KNOW WORK. REFORMING OUR ARE OUTDATED STANDARD IS COMMON. SEATTLE FOR AN EXAMPLE HAS SEEN A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF USE OF FORCE INCIDENCES. AFTER ADOPTING A STANDARD SIMILAR TO THE ONE IN CALIFORNIA AT TO SAVE LIVES. OFFICERS HAVE REMAINED JUST TO SAVE. WE GIVE OFFICERS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT POWER WE GIVE TO ANY PUBLIC EMPLOYEE THE POWER OF LIFE AND DEATH OVER US WE MUST MAKE SURE THE POLICE USE THAT POWER JUDICIOUSLY. WITH RESPECT TO HUMAN RIGHTS AND WHAT THEY BELIEVE IN THE SANCTITY OF ALL HUMAN LIFE AND ONLY WHEN ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. WE MUST ALSO HOLD POLICE ACCOUNTABLE WHENEVER THEY MISS USE THAT POWER. UNDER AB THREE NINETY TWO COURTS WILL GROUP ACQUIRED TO CONSIDER THE OFFICER'S ACTIONS LEADING UP TO THE USE OF DEADLY FORCE AS PART OF THE STOP COALITION I SUPPORT AN ADVOCATE WITH DOZENS OF OTHER FAMILIES. LEVEL AND WERE KILLED BY THE POLICE IN NEARLY EVERY CASE NO ONE WAS HELD ACCOUNTABLE NO POLICIES WOULD CHANGE PREVENT FUTURE TRAGEDIES. MY BROTHER SUFFERED A LOT IN THIS LIFE THAT DAY HE JUST NEEDED HELP. HE DIDN'T DESERVE TO BE KILLED. HE DESERVED COMPASSION. AND HE DESERVED RESPECT FOR THE SANCTITY OF HIS LIFE. JUST BECAUSE SOMEBODY WANTS TO DIE DOESN'T MEAN POLLUTION SHOULD THEM. IF AB THREE NINETY TWO PASSES CALIFORNIA WILL GO FROM HAVING ONE OF THE DEADLIEST USE OF FORCE. LAWS IN THE COUNTRY TO HAVING ONE OF THE MOST PROTECTIVE LAWS IN THE COUNTRY IN CALIFORNIA WILL BE THE ONLY STATE TO COMBINE THE NECESSARY STANDARD. WITH THE REQUIREMENT THAT COURTS CONSIDER OFFICERS CONDUCT LEADING UP TO THE USE OF DEADLY FORCE. IN DETERMINING ITS ILLEGALITY. NONE OF THIS COULD MAKE. A POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE LEADERSHIP AND COURAGE OF THE COUNTLESS FAMILIES WHO LOST LOVED ONES TO POLICE VIOLENCE AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT TO MAKE SURE WE CAN LIVE WITH DIGNITY. AND FREE FROM THE FEAR OF POLICE VIOLENCE AB THREE NINETY TWO IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. TOWARD GREATER APPRECIATION OF LIFE INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE SUICIDAL AND STUFF BRING. AND TOWARD JUSTICE FOR OUR LOST LOVED ONES. THIS IS HOW I WILL HONOR MY BROTHER'S LIFE. MY FIGHTING TO MAKE SURE THAT OTHER FAMILIES DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH WHAT WE'VE GONE. PASS A BE THREE NINETY TWO TODAY LET US LIVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT -- WITNESS. YES MY NAME IS DIONNE SMITH DOWNS.

TO THE EMOTION IN THE REALITY OF OF WHAT'S BEEN X. EXPRESSED BY MANY OF THE FAMILY WITNESSES BUT IN PARTICULAR THE MOTHERS. A DOCTOR WHERE WERE YOU AND I OFTEN HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT MOTHER IN AN EASY. ALL AND I WAS REMINDED OF THAT ONCE AGAIN TODAY BY. THE WITNESSES WHO EXHIBIT SUCH SHEER STRENGTH IN RECOUNTING FOR US -- PAINFUL PAINFUL STORIES AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT IT IS NOT. IT MADE YOU ARE HEARD. AND WE GET IT. AND THE IMPORTANCE OF YOUR ENGAGE WITH IN THIS PROCESS AS PAINFUL AS IT MAY BE. IS TO INFORM US AS POLICY MAKERS IN TERMS OF THE KINDS OF DECISIONS WE HAVE TO MAKE EVERY DAY ON BEHALF OF THE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE. TO CALL CALIFORNIA HOME ON AND I APPRECIATE THAT. AND WITH THAT -- I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL THANK YOU -- THERE IS A MOTION ANY FURTHER COMMENT SENATOR WIENER. THANK YOU -- CENTER JACKSON -- OFFER SO DOT DOT DOT IRVINE. DOCTOR OF I WANT. TO I APOLOGIES ALLERGY SEASON -- I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP BUT NOT SISTER LEADERSHIP YOUR PERSISTENCE -- BECAUSE IT WAS A YEAR AGO THAT WE WERE -- HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE -- AND I WAS PROUD TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF OF AB NINE THIRTY ONE AS IT WAS CALLED AT THAT TIME ALONG WITH OTHER MEMBERS. OF THIS COMMITTEE -- AND IT DIDN'T HAPPEN LAST YEAR BUT YOU KNOW -- YOU ARE -- TENACIOUS AND COMING BACK AND NOT LETTING IT GO AND THE COALITION WAS NOT ABOUT TO LET IT GO THANKFULLY -- AND AND HERE WE ARE AND I KNOW IT HASN'T BEEN EASY AND THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT NEGOTIATIONS -- BY HI THIS IS STILL A VERY STRONG BILL -- THAT WILL SAVE LIVES AND SO I'M PROUD TO SUPPORT TODAY. I ALSO WANT TO SAY TO SOME OF THE FAMILIES WHO CAME OUT AND I KNOW I MADE THESE COMMENTS. WHEN -- WE HEARD SB TWO THIRTY A FEW MONTHS AGO -- THAT HIGH - I CANNOT EVEN BEGIN TO COMPREHEND WHAT IT IS WHAT IT MUST BE LIKE TO HAVE TO BIRD AND I SAID TO HAVE TO BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE COMPELLED TO TELL TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED -- IN THE NAME OF JUSTICE -- AND I TO TO COME OUT OVER AND OVER AGAIN BECAUSE THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME TO ANY OF THESE FAMILIES OF COURSE HAS. SPOKEN PUBLICLY -- ABOUT -- THE TRAGEDY THAT THAT THE THE THE THE HORROR OF WHAT HAPPENED -- AND TO TALK ABOUT THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN AB I KNOW EVERY TIME IT. IT'S JUST I I CAN I CAN EVEN IMAGINE -- I DON'T WANT TO THANK ALL THE FAMILIES -- THAT HAVE BEEN WILLING -- TO IN JUROR THAT PAIN OVER AND OVER AGAIN -- IN THE NAME OF MAKING POSITIVE CHANGES IN CALIFORNIA SO I'M HAPPY. TO I SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY. BETTER BRADFORD THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I TO WANNA CALL THE SENTIMENTS OF MUCH WHAT MY COLLEAGUES HERE AT THE MOMENT MOST IMPORTANTLY WHAT. THE WITNESSES HAVE SAID TODAY AND WHAT YOU SAID -- REALIZE YEAR. TO BRING THIS MEASURE FORWARD AND TO THE TREMENDOUS COURAGE THAT DOCTOR WEBER HAS SHOWN AND I'M HONORED TO BE. A CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL. BUT I MOVED TO THE FACT THAT. WE REALLY DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THIS COUNTRY WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH RACE. AND THAT'S AT THE CORE OF WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY. BECAUSE OF WE UNDERSTAND THE ORIGIN. OF THE USE OF DEADLY FORCE IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO IT WAS IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO FREE AFRICANS AND IN THIS COUNTRY. IT WAS NO GREATER THREAT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO THEN IT WAS. IN. SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SIX THE ONLY DIFFERENCE WAS BLOCKS WERE FREE AND THIS WAS A WAY OF SUPPRESSING PEOPLE AND WE'VE SEEN THROUGHOUT HISTORY WHETHER IT'S AN OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM WHETHER IT'S IN OUR HOUSING WHETHER TíNH JOBS IN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM. RACE IS ALWAYS THE COURT AND IT DEMONSTRATES ITSELF MORE IN POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY AND WE SEE IT HERE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. AT I GREW UP IN A WHITE COMMUNITY AND I SAW THE INTERACTION THAT WAS DIFFERENT BETWEEN MY WIFE FRANCE WHEN IT CAME LAW ENFORCEMENT AND WHEN IT CAME TO PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKEME. AND IT WAS A STARK DIFFERENCE AND I REMEMBER A HEARING WE HAD. AN ASSEMBLY WHEN I CHAIR TO SLOT COMMITTEE ON BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR. AND WE HAD A POLICE CHIEF. AND THAT HEARING THAT. AFTERNOON [inaudible] AND WE WERE ASKING ABOUT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES OF DEALING WITH. YOUNG BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR. AND HE STOPPED FOR A MOMENT ANY SAYS THE HARDEST DAY OF MY LIFE WAS WHEN MY SIXTEEN YEAR OLD SON GOT HIS DRIVER'S LICENSE. AND I HAD TO SIT HIM DOWN AND EXPLAIN WHAT HE SHOULD DO NOT IF HE STOPPED BY THE POLICE BUT WHEN HE STOPPED BY THE POLICE. THIS INDIVIDUAL WAS A BLACK POLICE CHIEF ANY SAYS MY WHITE COUNTERPARTS DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION WITH THEIR KIDS. SO WE NEED TO TELL THE TRUTH HERE TODAY AND UNDERSTAND THAT THE CORE. TRAINING WILL NOT CHANGE PEOPLE'S HEART WE HAVE TO CHANGE OUR VIEW AS IT RELATES TO RACE IN THIS COUNTRY AND UNDERSTAND IT'S AT THE CORE OF EVERYTHING THAT'S BAD HERE. WE WERE FOUNDED ON RACISM AND WE'VE IN SLAVE THE BLACK PERSON WE EXPLOIT IT THE BROWN AND YELLOW PEOPLE. AND WE HAD TRIED TO ANNIHILATE TO READ MAN AND WE HAVE TO ACCEPT IT FOR WHAT IT IS SO. UNTIL WE CAN CHANGE. THE HEART OF PEOPLE THEY OFTEN SAY WHY DO BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE RUN FROM FROM THE POLICE. THEY FEAR THE POLICE. AND YOU CAN NEVER RESPECT AND TRUST ANYTHING OR ANYONE THAT YOU FEAR. SO UNTIL WE CAN REMOVE THAT FEAR FACTOR WE'RE GOING TO STILL HAVE THESE CHALLENGES. AND YOU CAN'T PROTECT. AND SERVE AND TO YOU RESPECT AND PRESERVE LIFE. SENATOR JACKSON IS THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE APPRECIATE THOSE ELOQUENT IN AND ACCURATE SADLY ACCURATE REMARKSABOUT OUR NATION WHICH TODAY IS BECOMING EVEN MORE. DIVIDED -- YOU MENTIONED RACE AND ETHNICITY AND AND RELIGION IT'S IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT AND WE HAVE TO DO MUCH BETTER. BUT I THINK ONE OF THE ADDITIONAL ASPETS THAT I JUST WANTED. TO BRING. TO THE FORE IS THE SORT OF THE PARAMILITARY NATURE. OF HOW LAW ENFORCEMENT NOW VIEWS ITSELF REALLY RATHER THAN AS COMMUNITY INTERVENE ORDERS -- AS AS A PARALEGAL MILITARY OPERATION. AND I THINK OF IN MY HOPE IS THAT WITH THIS TRAINING. WE WILL GO BACK OR OR CANYON SINGLE BACK THAT WE WILL EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT -- TRUST IN PROTECT ASPECT OF WHAT POLICING IS AT LEAST THEORETICALLY SUPPOSED TO BE. A PROTECTING THE PUBLIC -- BUT I THINK IN TODAY'S WORLD WE LACK THAT ELEMENT OF COMPASSION. WE LACKED THAT ELEMENT OF TRYING TO INTERVENE EFFECTIVELY. AND RATHER THAN JUST ASSUME THAT THE ONLY WAY TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM IS WITH A GUN. WE HAVE TO REALIZE THAT THERE ARE OTHER IN MUCH BETTER WAYS TO DO THIS. AS WE'VE LEARNED -- ABOUT THE BRAIN AS WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT MENTAL ILLNESS. HOPEFULLY WE WILL APPLY THE TECHNIQUES THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE MANY OF WHOM AND AS LISTENING TO THE THE HEARTFELT AND AND GUT WRENCHING STORIES OF PEOPLE WHO LOST LOVED ONES. MANY OF THEIR LOVED ONES HAVE BEEN IN CRISIS WHETHER IT'S THROUGH PTSD WHETHER IT'S JUST SIMPLE FEAR -- THAT MAKES PEOPLE REACT RATHER THAN BE RATIONAL. I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT UPON LAW ENFORCEMENT AND I SUSPECT THAT'S PART OF WHAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBBER'S EFFORT IS HERE IS TO GET US TO USE THE BUILT ALL THE TOOLS THAT WE HAVE TO TRY TO DE ESCALATE THESE PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THEY BECOME -- OF VIOLENCE AND BEFORE -- THEY'D THE RESULT IN THE DEATHS IN THE SERIOUS INJURY TO PEOPLE THAT ARE PROBABLY OTHERWISE AFFORDABLE SO I TO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE WORK THAT -- THAT YOU'VE DONE A DOCTOR WEBER THIS STRUCTURE IS NOT BEEN EASY. I AM SO PLEASED THAT THERE WAS NO OPPOSITION HERE TODAY IT SOUNDS LIKE WE'VE MADE PROGRESS IT'S NOT PERFECT. BUT I THINK IF WE START FOCUSING ON INTERVENTIONS -- RATHER THAN. THE DEADLY FORCE I THINK WE'RE GOING TO REALLY CHANGE. OUR COMMUNITIES AND DO SO FOR THE BETTER SO I ALSO SUPPORT THE pAND WILL BE HAPPY TO VOTE. FOR THANK YOU COLLEAGUES FOR FEAR GOOD COMMENTS AND ASSEMBLYMEMBER WEBER. INCREDIBLE RESPECT FOR YOUR PERSISTENCE. AND YOUR WILLINGNESS. TO HANG IN THERE. AND CONTINUE THIS SUCH IMPORTANT. POLICY DEBATE. AND MOVEMENT ON A VERY NEEDED POLICY AND I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU ALL KUDOS FOR THAT. AND I WANT TO ALSO EXPRESS -- KUDOS FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO SIT DOWN AND ENGAGE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT WHICH WE WOULD LOOKED LIKE WE WERE MAYBE AT A SITUATION. WHERE -- THOSE DISCUSSIONS WERE EITHER WERE NOT HAPPENING OR PERHAPS WERE PRODUCTIVE AND SO I WANTED BOTH THINK LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR ENGAGING. WITH YOU IN YOUR OFFICE IN YOUR AND YOUR BILL SPONSORS AND ALSO YOU FOR THAT WILLINGNESS THAT HAS BROUGHT US TO THIS SITUATION TODAY WHERE WE HAVE A BILL BEFORE US WITH NO OPPOSITION. SO -- JUST RESPECTING KUDOS AND THEN I ALSO WANTED TO EXPRESS TO ALL OF YOU WHO ARE HERE. AND I WANT TO SAY THAT ON THE ONE HAND I HOPE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME BACK. AND RELIVE THE TRAUMA BY DISCUSSING YOUR LOVED ONE'S DEATH FOR OTHER PEOPLE YOU KNOWS -- DEATH. ON THE OTHER HAND I HOPE THAT YOU DO COME BACK BECAUSE YOUR ENGAGEMENT AND YOUR PERSISTENCE HAS MATTERED. AND IT HAS MADE A DIFFERENCE. IT HAS ENABLED THIS DISCUSSION TO CONTINUE TO BE HONEST AND TO BE VERY FORTHRIGHT. AND AS WE DEVELOP PUBLIC POLICY AS LEGISLATORS WE NEED THE ENGAGEMENT OF THE AFFECTED PARTIES AND SO I WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT AND YOUR WILLINGNESS TO REALLY DEAL WITH SUBJECTS THAT ARE. HEART BREAKING AND DIFFICULT BUT AS A POLICY CHANGE SO NEEDED -- AND THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD FOR YOUR VERY STRONG COMMENTS I THINK THERE ARE MANY MANY FACTORS THAT. WHETHER IT'S THE THE ABILITY TO HAVE ON EITHER BODY CAMERAS OF OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ARE ALL OF US WITH THE FACT THAT WE HAVE ON OUR PERSON AT ALL TIMES THE ABILITY TO TAKE VIDEOS. THERE'S SO MANY FACTORS THESE THOSE VIDEOS OF THESE INCIDENTS THE NATIONAL CONVERSATION THAT HAS BEEN UNDER WAY FOR SOME TIME MANY MANY OTHER THINGS. THAT HAVE BEEN ENABLED US. TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE ROOT OF SO MANY PROBLEMS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO CORRECT. HIS RACISM. AND IT IS ALLOWED I THINK SO MANY MORE PEOPLE TO SPEAK MORE DIRECTLY TO THAT FACT. AND WE ON THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE GOT A GREAT HISTORY LESSON FROM OUR COLLEAGUE SENATOR BRADFORD YESTERDAY ABOUT THE SODA BIG RED AND WHILE I WAS FAMILIAR WITH THAT SODA. I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW ANY HISTORY OF IT REFLECTING THE BLOODSHED OF AFRICAN AMERICANS AS SLAVES ONCE FREED AND UNFORTUNATELY -- CONTINUING TODAY SO IT'S THE DISCUSSION THE PUBLIC DISCUSSION AROUND THESE MATTERS AND OUR ABILITY AND WILLINGNESS TO SPEAK TRUTHFULLY AND DIRECTLY. I THINK ADVANCES THE POLICIES THAT ALL OF US ARE ENGAGED IN TRYING TO MAKE. SO I REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU AND AGAIN THANK THE AUTHOR. AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE A MOTION. YES I WOULD BE UPGRADE THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL -- ANY OTHER COMMENTS ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU. AND PROVIDING THE TESTIMONY CONCERNING -- THE USE OF LETHAL FORCE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I TRULY HAVE TO THANK THE PARENTS AND THE VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS THAT ENTRUSTED THEIR FAITH IN ME. TO CARRY THIS BILL FORD. AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE YOU HAVE TAUGHT ME SO MUCH. IN THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF NOT ONLY HAVE I EXPERIENCED AND FELT YOUR HURT IN YOUR PAIN. BUT MOST IMPORTANT YOUR PERSISTENCE. I WAS ASKED BY ONE MEDIA PERSONS IS WHY YOU EXPENDING SUCH POLITICAL CAPITAL ON THIS BILL. AND I HAD TO REMIND THEM WHO GAVE ME THE CAPITAL. IT'S THE COMMUNITIES THAT I SIR AND I'VE ALWAYS SERVED WHO GAVE ME THE CAPITAL AND IS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO USE THAT CAPITAL IN THEIR BEST INTEREST. AND I WAS ON IT HONOR TO BASICALLY BE ABLE TO CARRY THIS BILL FORWARD. SOMEONE ASKED ME. WHY ARE YOU FIGHTING SO HARD? AND I SAID I'VE BEEN BLACK ALL MY LIFE. AND A PART OF THAT IS THE ABILITY TO FIGHT. BUT IF I STAND TODAY AT THIS POINT IN MY LIFE AT THIS AGE. IT IS BECAUSE I'VE LEARNED HOW TO STAND AND HOW TO BE PERSISTENT. AND THE FIGHT FOR MY PLACE IN YOUR PLACE IN THIS WORLD. SO I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO UTILIZE ALL OF THE POLITICAL CAPITAL THAT YOU GAVE ME. KNOWING THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO GIVE ME THAT CAPITAL. AND THAT IT WOULD NEVER BE EXPENDED. I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE COMMUNITIES WHO CAME FORWARD FROM ALL OVER THE STATE. AND THE DIVERSITY OF THE PAIN THAT WAS SHOWN HERE. SO OFTEN WE ONLY THINK IT'S BLACK AND BROWN. BUT YOU SEE EVERYONE IS AFFECTED BY THE VIOLENCE THAT HAPPENS IN THIS NATION. AND PARTICULARLY IN THE STATE. AND THAT IN ITSELF IS HEARTWARMING BECAUSE EVERY TIME WE'VE CALL THEY'VE BEEN HERE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY THINK NEEDS TO HAPPEN AND THEIR FAITH IN CALIFORNIA. THE BELIEF IN CALIFORNIA THAT CALIFORNIA CAN AND MUST DO BETTER. I WANT TO THANK THE POLICE OFFICERS AND POLICE OFFICERS ASSOCIATIONS WHO -- WERE VEHEMENTLY OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. BROUGH RECENTLY SAT DOWN AND WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSTAND THEIR CONCERN. AND THEY'RE CONCERNED THAT WITH ABLE TO BE JUDGED ON HINDSIGHT WHICH WAS NOT WHAT THE INTENT OF THIS BILL WAS. I MADE CLEAR TO THEM IN THE VERY BEGINNING THAT THIS BILL WAS NOT TO BE A GOT TO BE ALL. THIS IS A BILL TO PREVENT DEATH. AND TO PROVIDE SAFETY FOR OFFICERS AND COMMUNITIES. I HAD TO EXPLAIN TO THEM THAT I WANT TO COMMUNITY THAT WHERE I CAN CALL POLICE OFFICERS WHEN I HAVE DIFFICULTY. AND KNOW THAT THE SITUATION WILL BE BETTER AND NOT WORSE. I WANT TO SHE I WHAT I DID NOT WANT TO HAVE TO SIT AND TELL THE STORY. THAT MODE WAS TOLD TO MY BROTHER. AND MY UNCLES AND MY GRANDFATHER ABOUT INTERACTION WITH PLEASE. I DON'T WANT TO TELL THAT STORY TO A KEY TO COULD DEAR AND JULIE ALL. MY FIVE AND SEVEN YEAR OLD GRANDSON'S. I WANT THEM TO LIVE IN THE WORLD THAT THEY THINK THEY LIVE IN RIGHT NOW. WHICH IS ONE THAT IS WONDERFUL WITH THEIR FRIENDS OF ALL KINDS OF OF RACE AND AND GENDER. WHERE THEY CAN ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE JUDGED FAIRLY AND JUSTLY ON PLAYGROUND WHEN THEY HAVE DIFFICULTY? THAT'S THE WORLD THEY DESERVE AND THAT'S THE WORLD THAT I MUST GIVE TO THEM AFTER FOUR HUNDRED YEARS OF STRUGGLING IN THIS COUNTRY FOR JUST SIMPLE JUSTICE AND EQUALITY AND TO BE TREATED FAIRLY. SO I SIMPLY WANT TO SAY THAT I AM HONORED TO CARRY THIS BILL. HONOR TO DEMONSTRATE WHAT MY MOTHER AN MY GRANDMOTHER AND MY GREAT GREAT GRANDMOTHER'S OF ALWAYS TAUGHT ME ABOUT THE STRENGTH OF BLACK WOMEN. BUT WE ARE THE MULES OF THE WORLD. THAT WE CARE THE BURDEN THAT NOBODY ELSE WANTS TO KERRY. AND I'M PROUD TO BE THAT NEW FOR YOU. AB THREE NINE TWO IS A NECESSARY STEP IN AFFIRMING THE SANCTITY OF LIFE AND PROTECTING HUMAN RIGHTS. AND WE HAVE GONE TOO MANY DAYS FAR ALONG WITH TOO MANY DEATHS. BECAUSE OF OUR OWN ACTIONS AND THOSE WHO HAVE THE POWER TO ENACT CHANGE THAT IS CRITICAL. THE NEED FOR REFORM IS CLEAR. AND IT IS LONG OVERDUE. I WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR. I WANT TO THANK MY PRESIDENT PRO TEM HERE IN THE SENATE MY GOOD FRIEND WHO PROMISED TO BRING THIS BILL BACK. I DON'T THINK THE SPEAKER MISTER RENDON FOR HIS COURAGE ND SIGNING ON TO THIS BILL. FOR THE LEADERSHIP OF THIS HOUSE IS FINALLY SAY IT TIME IS UP. TIME IS UP FOR INJUSTICE. TIME IS JUST RIGHT FOR US TO HAVE A STATE WHY POLICY THE FIRST STATE IN THE NATION. BUT HOW WILL HAVE A POLICY THAT RESPECTS THE SAME TO T. OF LIFE. THAT WOULD TRAIN ITS OFFICERS TO BASICALLY ENGAGE IN DE ESCALATION STRATEGIES. THAT WILL NOT MAKE THEM AT HARM BUT BASICALLY MAKE THEM SAFE AS WELL AS OUR COMMUNITIES. AND FOR THAT REASON AND ON BEHALF OF ALL OF THE CO AUTHORS AND ALL THE THE WORK THOSE OF YOU WHO WORK SO HARD FOR THE LAST YEAR. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN IDOL TO AB.

I'M CHANGE THESE YOUNG MEN'S LIVES -- WE WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON A BEFORE. THIRTEEN GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND SENATORS PAMELA GIVES REPRESENTING THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION WE STRONGLY SUPPORT A BEFORE THIRTEEN AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER BRIDGET JONES SAWYER IS EFFORTS OVER THE YEARS. TO SUPPORT CHILDREN THAT WE FIND OUT PROMISE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT LAKE TAHOE IS PROUD OF IS THE FACT THAT WE SERVE CHILDREN WHO FACE NUMEROUS CHALLENGES. THERE EITHER INCARCERATED THEY HAVE FACED NUMEROUS SITUATIONS OF TRAUMA AND WE WORK VERY HARD TO ADDRESS FOSTER YOUTH HOMELESS YOUTH -- AND OTHERS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE THINK IS IMPORTANT WITH THIS BILL IS THAT IT CHANGES THE COLD AND THEY'RE BY CHANGING OUR LANGUAGE. CAN PERMEATE MANY OF THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PROGRAM'S REFERENCED IN THE EDUCATION AND PENAL CODE SYSTEM THAT YOU SEE BEFORE YOU. WE THINK THAT IN TURN WILL HELP US AS WE VOLUNTEER AND SERVE OUR YOUTH WILL CHANGE OUR LANGUAGE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE PERCEPTION OF THE STUDENTS THEMSELVES. SO BEING OUT PROMISE WHEN THEY ATTEND A PROGRAM OR SOME KIND OF EVENTS IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. I HAVE EXPERIENCE OF WORKING WITH NUMEROUS ORGANIZATIONS AND HAVE WAS OF FOUND. A VERY DISMAYED BECAUSE I PARTICIPATED IN A PROGRAM WHERE THERE WAS A FLYER THAT REFERENCE THE CHILDREN AS AT RISK OF WHEN THEY CAME TO PARTICIPATE IN A PROGRAM. AND SINCE I'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH THIS BILL OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. I THOUGHT ABOUT HOW I WOULD FEEL IF I WALKED INTO AN AUDITORIUM AND A FLYER EXPRESSING THE PROGRAM SAID. THIS IS TO BENEFIT AT RISK YOUTH AND I THOUGHT. WOULDN'T IT BE WONDERFUL IF THE FLYERS SAID WERE BENEFITING AT PROMISE YOUTH. SO FOR THAT REASON AND FOR THE REASON THAT WE WANT CHILDREN TO SEE THEMSELVES AS PROMISING WE OR DRIVE VOTE FOR THE BILL THANK YOU. RIGHT TO HAVE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THE SIX DOLLAR SIGN. KAELIN DEAN FROM THE ALLIANCE FOR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR -- IN PROUD SUPPORT THANK YOU. ISRAEL VIA WITH ME BY IN STRONG SUPPORT [inaudible] MANY OTHERS. ALL RIGHT TO WEAR MANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION.

WIENER I'VE WIENER I I WILL -- KEEP THE BILL ON CALL AND WILL ALLOW YOU TO GO TO YOUR NEXT ITEM WHICH IS FIFTEEN A. B. NINE TWENTY SEVEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AB NINE TWENTY SEVEN REVISED ITS STATE LAW BY REQUIRING A DEFINING OF A DEFENDANT'S ABILITY TO PAY PRIOR TO THE ASSESSMENT OF A FINER FEE. IN CALIFORNIA BOTH THE GOVERNMENT AND PENAL CODE CONTAINS SECTIONS THAT REQUIRE THE COURT TO ASSESS FINES AND FEES ON CRIMINAL. DEFENDANTS DEFINES RECESS WITHOUT REGARD TO THE DEFENDANT'S ABILITY TO PAY. FUNDS RECEIVED PROVIDE MONEY FOR AT LEAST FIFTY DIFFERENT STATE AND LOCAL PROGRAMS AS IDENTIFIED BY THE LA OWES OFFICE. THIS EFFECTIVELY CREATES A SET FOR DEBT FUNDS COURTS STATE GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL NEEDS ON THE BACKS OF POOR PEOPLE. THERE IS OVER TEN BILLION BILLION WOULD BE AN OUTSTANDING V. AND FIND IT IN CALIFORNIA WOULD CLEARLY SHOWS THAT WE ARE OVER RELIANCE ON ON COLLECTIBLE FINES. FROM POOR DEFENDANTS IN RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT THESE HEFTY FINES ARE OFTEN LEVIED ON A POOR. JUDICIAL COUNCIL FOLLOWING THE WORK DONE BY THE COMMISSION ON THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA COURT SYSTEM HAS BEEN WORKING ON A PILOT PROGRAM THAT WOULD ALLOW DEFENDANTS TO SEEK REDUCED OR WAIVED FEES FOR TRAFFIC FINES. TRAFFIC FINES MAKE UP TWO THIRDS OF CURRENT ASSESS PARTS. THIS BILL ADDRESSES THE REMAINING THIRD THE FINES LEVIED AFTER MISDEMEANOR FELONY THIS BILL DOES THREE THINGS FIRST. IT FLIPS THE PRESUMPTION ABILITY TO PAY FROM THE DEFENDANT TO THE PROSECUTION REQUIRING THEM TO SHOW AN ABILITY TO PAY WHEN THAT IS IN QUESTION SECOND CREATES A PRESUMPTION. THAT THE HOMELESS THOSE ARE NEED SPACE ASSISTANCE THOSE MEETING THE DEFINITION OF VERY LOW INCOME AND THOSE SENTENCED TO LENGTHY SENTENCES ARE UNABLE TO PAY. FINALLY ESTABLISH A SYSTEM OF FACTORS FOR COURTS TO CONSIDER WHEN EVALUATING ABILITY TO PAY INCLUDING WHETHER OR NOT THE DEFENDANT HAD A PUBLIC DEFENDER. THIS BILL IS IN LINE WITH RECENT COURT RULINGS IN THIS AREA THE SECOND COURT OF APPEALS IN CALIFORNIA HELD THE IMPOSING FINES WITH OUT AN ASSESSMENT OF ABILITY TO PAY WAS A VIOLATION OF DUE PROCESS. THE SUPREME COURT ALSO NOTED THAT EXCESSIVE FINES ARE THREAT TO CIVIL LIBERTIES AND RECENT THAMES PURSES INDIANA CASE. THIS IS A BALK WILL BUILD THAT BOUNCES CIVIL LIBERTIES COURT. WORKLOAD AND FUNDAMENTAL SENSE OF FAIRNESS MEMBERS ARE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE BOAT WITH ME TODAY IS MARCO GEORGE THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION. OF COURSE MARKET. CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION. I AM HONORED TO BE ASKED TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THIS BILL AND I APPLAUD ASSEMBLY MMBER. REGINALD JONES SAWYER FOR BRINGING THIS BILL AS A PUBLIC DEFENDER ALL TOO OFTEN I SAW FIRST HAND THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF AND PAID FINES AND FEES ON THE LIVES OF MY CLIENTS. A MANY TIMES SAY FACED ADDITIONAL INCARCERATION FOR FAILURE TO PAY. WHICH ALSO COST THE COMMUNITY AND THE TAXPAYERS -- TO TO HOUSE THEM. THERE WERE FINANCIAL BURDENS ON THEIR FAMILIES. THERE WAS AN INABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY REINTEGRATE AND TO THE COMMUNITY -- MANY OF THEM FACED HOMELESSNESS THE PROSPECT OF EITHER PAYING. UNREALISTIC FINES AND FEES ARE BEING HOMELESS OR PAYING THE RENT. AND AN ALL TOO MANY CASES PEOPLE ONCE THEY WERE UNABLE TO PAY THE FINES OR FEES WARRANTS WERE ISSUED AND THEY WERE RETURNED TO JAIL BECOMING A BURDEN ON THE TAXPAYERS. THE FINES AND FEES HAVE BEEN PART OF FINANCING THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ON THE BACKS OF THE POOR AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. THE SENATE SYSTEM PERVERSE INCENTIVES ACROSS THE BOARD. COURTS -- INCREASED FEES TO PAY FOR THE COURT SYSTEM AND PROBATION OFFICERS WHO SHOULD BE TASKED WITH HELPING PEOPLE RE INTEGRATE INTO THE COMMUNITY BECOME BILL COLLECTORS. I WOULD ECHO THE ASSEMBLY. COMMENTS ABOUT THE SUPREME COURT AND STATE COURT PRECEDENT THIS IS A COMMON SENSE. A FISH OUT. AND MONEY SAVING REFORM. URGE YOUR AYE VOTE [inaudible] THANK YOU.

RIGHT THE BILL IS MOVED AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER. HI. CHAIR OF PUBLIC SAFETY IN THE ASSEMBLY HOUSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS -- I THINK WE HAVE. SEEN. A LOT OF MOVEMENT ON THIS ISSUE OF THE FEES AND FINES BOTH LEGISLATION BY. MEMBERS OF OUR TWO HOUSES AS WELL AS ACTION BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS RECOGNIZING. NOT ONLY THE INABILITY TO COLLECT IN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY'RE SPENDING TRYING TO COLLECT ON FEES AND FINES THAT THEY CAN'T BUT ALSO THE IMPACT IT HAS ON LOW INCOME PEOPLE. AND I WATCHED A FASCINATING DOCUMENTARY OVER THE WEEKEND ON PUBLIC TELEVISION IT WAS SAID IT WAS -- AROUND INDIVIDUALS WHO LIVED IN INDIANAPOLIS BUT IT SHOWED A MAN WHO WAS -- HAD FIRST BEEN CONVICTED OF A MINOR CHARGE WHEN HE WAS YOUNG. AND BUT AS A RESULT OF THAT WAS THEN -- IT IMPACTED HIS ABILITY TO GET JOBS AND SAID SHE WAS ON PUBLIC ASSISTANCE RAISING HIS. DAUGHTER ALONE WHO IS AN EPILEPTIC. AND HE THEN HE EITHER PARKING EITHER PARKING VIOLATION OR SOME OTHER -- TRAFFIC TYPE OF VIOLATION WHICH THE FINDS GREW TO SUCH A POINT THAT THERE WAS A WARRANT OUT FOR HIS ARREST AND AS HE WAS TRYING TO GET HIS RECORDS SEALED HE HAD TO TURN HIMSELF IN. FOR THAT WHICH INCLUDE WHICH THEN ADDED ANOTHER CONVICTION AND THEN STARTED OVER THE CLOCK FOR WHEN HE COULD GET IT SEALED SO HERE WAS A PERSON WHO WAS. BASICALLY DOING EVERYTHING HE COULD TO GET HIMSELF IN A SITUATION TO BE ABLE -- TO HAVE THE KIND OF EMPLOYMENT THAT WOULD ALLOW HIM TO BE OFFICES STINTS IN SUPPORT HIMSELF IN HIS DAUGHTER. AND YET THESE SIR. THE SEARCH SITUATIONS WERE JUST CONTINUING TO PLAGUE AND IT WAS -- IT WAS BOTH HEART BREAKING AND ALSO -- INSPIRING BUT IT HE'S HE ANOTHER SHOULD NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT SO I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. AND WITHOUT WILL TAKE WILL WILL ASK YOUR CLOTHES AND THEN WE'LL TAKE A ROLL CALL. MADAM CHAIR I WILL. AS CHAIR PUBLISHED IN A PUBLIC SAFETY I WILL. TAKE YEAR ELOQUENT AND THOUGHTFUL COMMENT AS MY CLOSE. DATE WITH ZERO CALL. BUSH'S THE PAST TWO APPROPRIATIONS SKINNER. FIVE I'M MORE LOCK. MORE LIKE AYE BRADFORD. BRADFORD AYE JACKSON MITCHELL BROWN. AROUND A WINNER. I WIENER HIGH. ALRIGHT WE'LL KEEP IT ON CALL AND NOW WE HAVE -- ITEMS SEVENTEEN CORRECT AB. TWELVE SIXTY ONE YOUR BILL ON CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. THANK YOU. UP I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB TWELVE SIXTY ONE A BILL THAT THAT DELETES REQUIREMENT FOR NARCOTICS OFFICERS TO REGISTER WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. UNDER CURRENT LAW A PERSON CONVICTED OF CERTAIN DRUG OFFENSES REQUIRED TO REGISTER WITH THEIR LOCAL POLICE CHIEF FOR SHARE. WHEN REGISTERING THE INDIVIDUALS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE FINGERPRINTS GET PHOTOGRAPHED AND PROVIDE INFORMATION SUCH AS THEIR ADDRESS DATE OF BIRTH DRIVER'S LICENSE NUMBER OCCUPATION ADDRESS AND VEHICLE INFORMATION? EACH TIME A REGISTRANT MOVES THEY ARE DIRECT REQUIRED TO RE REGISTER WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT GOING THROUGH THIS SAME LABORIOUS PHOTOGRAPHING FINGERPRINTING AND INFORMATION GATHERING PROCESS. THIS IS AN INEFFICIENT PROCESS AND REDUNDANT GIVEN THAT ALL OF THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THE REGISTRY CAN BE FOUND IN THE PERSONALS CRIMINAL RECORD. IN ADDITION THE INFORMATION COLLECTED IS NOT PUT INTO A COLLECTED INDIVIDUALLY BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. BY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AS CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SAFETY I BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE LAW ENFORCEMENT'S TIME AND RESOURCES ARE BEING USED IN THE BEST INTEREST OF PUBLIC SAFETY. ALSO BELIEVE AS IMPORTANT TO REMOVE BARRIERS THAT PREVENT SUCCESSFUL REENTRY AND BECAUSE ADDITIONAL STRAIN ON THE EXCESSIVE WORKLOAD ON THE COURT SYSTEM. REMOVING A REQUIREMENT TO REGISTER. AT FALLS IN LIBER RECENT POLICY REFORM SUCH AS PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN AND SIXTY FOUR WHICH CALL FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM AND REHABILITATION PEOPLE RE ENTERING INTO COMMUNITIES. HERE TO TESTIFY TODAY AND TO ANSWER ANY QUESTION IS LARRY DOYLE FROM THE CONFERENCE OF CALIFORNIA BAR ASSOCIATION'S MEMBERS ARE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. MAY POLICY. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. IT SEEMS TO BE A TENDENCY TO KIND OF A QUITE THE NARCOTICS REGISTRATION REQUIREMENT WITH THE SEXUAL OFFENDER REGISTRATION REQUIREMENT BECAUSE THEY ARE DIFFERENT. THEY ARE REQUIRED DISTRICTS REQUIREMENTS. IT MAY BE A ONE TIME IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES THAT WAS. RELATIVELY TRUE. BUT THERE'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE THE INFORMATION THAT GOES FOR THE SEXUAL OFFENDERS REGISTRATION. IS MAINTAINED IN A CENTRAL DATABASE PROVIDED TO THE PUBLIC OF CALIFORNIA ONLINE THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE UNDER MEGAN'S LAW. AND IS -- THEREFORE OF SOME VALUE IN THAT WAY THE SEXUAL THE NARCOTICS REGISTRATION INFORMATION. IS SIMPLY A MASTER AT THE LOCAL EVEL AND PROVIDE GOES ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE THERE'S BEEN NO EFFORT EVER MADE. TO MAKE A STATEWIDE DATABASE IN THIS COMPLETELY INCONSISTENT WITH THE LAW CHANGES. WE'VE MADE RECENTLY. SO WHAT YOU HAVE IS A REGISTRATION REQUIREMENT WHICH IMPOSES A GREAT BURDEN. ON THE OFFENDERS BUT IT ALSO IMPOSES A MASSIVE BURDEN ON LAW ENFORCEMENT TO MAINTAIN THIS DATABASE. IT DOESN'T PROVIDE ANYBODY WITH ANYTHING VALUABLE AND IT'S A REALLY TIME. TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FACT AND MOVE ON AND MAKE BETTER USE OF OUR TIME RESOURCES. SO -- WE HOPE YOU WILL SUPPORT THIS BILL FIVE MISTER JONES SAWYER. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING GOING BACK AS FOR DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE IN SUPPORT.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY. NOW WE WILL GO TO I THINK IT'S I BELIEVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER I MEAN RUBIO. IS OF ROSE NEXT APOLOGY SO YOU SO ITEM. TWELVE ASSEMBLYMEMBER ROW. THAT IS AB. FIVE FIVE ONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU TO YOU AND YOUR STAFF AND I'LL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. AS AMENDED EIGHTY FIVE FIVE ONE SIMPLY WILL UPDATE CURRENT LAW TO REQUIRE DRUG TESTING IN ADDITION TO ALCOHOL TESTING AFTER FATAL VEHICLE COLLISIONS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK DR -- WITH ME TODAY'S JENNIFER HARMAN WITH THE COUNTY OF ORANGE CRIME LAB IF YOU HAVE ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. EXCELLENT. YOU MAY. PROCEED. THE NUMBER FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF AB. FIVE FIVE ONE I AM JENNIFER HARMON I'M CURRENTLY THE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR WITH THE ORANGE COUNTY CRIME LABORATORY AND A FORENSIC TOXICOLOGIST FOR NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS. EIGHTY FIVE FIFTY ONE IS AN EFFORT BY SCIENTISTS BY TOXICOLOGISTS TO IMPROVE THE FORENSIC TESTING AND DATA COLLECTION ON FATALLY INJURED DRIVERS. DR LUKE RHODA CHIEF TOXICOLOGIST AND LABORATORY DIRECTOROF THE SAN FRANCISCO MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE AND I BROUGHT THIS BILL FORWARD TO OUR LEGISLATORS. CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY PROVIDES FATALITY ANALYSIS REPORTING SYSTEM. BETTER KNOWN AS FARCE MORE DATA THAN ANY OTHER STATE. CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO PROVIDE THIS DATA IS PROBLEMATIC AS THE STATE HAS NOT UPDATED THE GOVERNMENT AND VEHICLE CODES THAT DICTATE TESTING. ON FATALLY INJURED DRIVER CASES FOR MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE YEARS. THE CODE AS IT CURRENTLY STANDS OBLIGATES CORNERS AND MEDICAL EXAMINERS TO TEST FOR ALCOHOL EXCLUSIVELY IN CASES WHERE SOMEONE WAS FATALLY INJURED. AND A DECISION IS TECH TO TEST FOR OTHER POTENTIALLY IMPAIRING SUBSTANCES IS LEFT UP TO THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT ENTITIES SET THE PRIORITIES ABOUT WHAT DATA SHOULD BE COLLECTED. IN TRAFFIC RELATED CASES THAT RESULT IN A DEATH. IT LEAVES CALIFORNIA AND THE NATION WITH LITTLE TO NO RELIABLE DATA ON PUBLIC HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY AND TAX WHEN SUBSTANCES IN ADDITION TO ALCOHOL ARE INVOLVED. IN TWENTY FIVE YEARS SUBSTANCE USE AND FORENSIC TESTING CAPABILITIES OF CHANGED. THE COUNTRY IS IN CRISIS WITH AN OPIOID EPIDEMIC AND ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNORS HIGHWAY SAFETY ASSOCIATION -- IMPAIRING SUBSTANCES WERE PRESENT IN 43% OF FATALLY INJURED DRIVERS THAT WERE TESTED. CALIFORNIA STATE TO STICKS MAY BE GROSSLY UNDER REPORTING THE PREVALENCE OF MANY SUBSTANCES IN THESE CASES. THIS ASSERTION IS FROM KNOWING THAT CALIFORNIA CORNERS THE MEDICAL EXAMINERS ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO TEST TRAFFIC SAFETY SUBSTANCES OTHER THAN ALCOHOL. ORANGE COUNTY DATA ALONE THE THIRD MOST POPULOUS COUNTY IN THE STATE FOUND THAT IN TWO THOUSAND AND 1862% OF OUR FATALLY INJURED DRIVERS AT LEAST ONE IMPAIRING SUBSTANCE IN THEIR SYSTEM. THIS IS A 6% INCREASE FROM TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN AND A 12% INCREASE FROM. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AS SCIENTISTS WE CANNOT UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM IF THERE IS IF THERE IS A PROBLEM. LET ALONE SOURCE SOLUTIONS TO FIX IT WITHOUT MEANINGFUL DATA. THIS BILL UPDATES THE CODES TO ALLOW CALIFORNIA THE OPPORTUNITY COLLECT DATA. TO UNDERSTAND IF SUBSTANCE USE IS PRESENT INCREASING OR DECREASING IN OUR FATALLY INJURED TRAFFIC SAFETY RELATED CASES. AND ADDITIONALLY ENSURES THAT ALL THE SEASONS OF TRAFFIC RELATED INCIDENTS ARE TESTED THE SAME WAY THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THANK YOU WHAT SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. OKAY ANY IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT SEEING NONE WE HAVE IN THE BILL AS AMENDED. AND OUR DISCUSSION SENATOR BRADFORD.

NOW WE WILL GO TO OUR OUR LAST ITEM WHICH IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- RUBIO. AND THAT IS ITEM SIXTEEN AB. TEN SEVENTY THREE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS TODAY I'M PRESENTING AB TEN SEVENTY THREE WHICH AUTHORIZES THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. TO ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT OR ICE TO LIMIT ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES AT THE VICTIM. THE VICTIM SERVICE LOCATIONS GENERAL'S OCTOBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN MODEL POLICIES ON IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT. EXISTING LAW PROHIBITS A STATE OR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY INCLUDING SCHOOL POLICE AND SECURITY DEPARTMENT FROM USING MONEY OR PERSONNEL TO INVESTIGATE INTERROGATE. DETAINED TACT -- ARREST PERSONS FOR IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT PURPOSES. SB FIFTY FOUR REQUIRED THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO ESTABLISH MODEL POLICIES LIMITING ASSISTANCE WITH IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT TO THE FULLEST EXTENT POSSIBLE. WE HAVE HAD ORGANIZATIONS REACH OUT TO US AND INFORM US THAT THEY HAVE SEEN A DECLINE IN UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS SEEKING SERVICES FOR DOMESTIC AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE SINCE ON TWENTY SIXTEEN MOST UNDOCUMENTED SURVIVORS ARE TOO AFRAID TO ASK FOR HELP. BECAUSE OF THE FEAR OF BEING RIPPED AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILIES. I UNDERSTAND HOW DIFFICULT. TO ACT. HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO ASK FOR HELP WITH PROPER DOCUMENTATION AND I CAN IMAGINE DIED WITHOUT -- DOCUMENTS IT'S THAT MUCH HARDER. LET ME BE CLEAR ICE CANNOT BE PERMANENTLY STOPPED FROM ENTERING THESE LOCATIONS. HOWEVER AB TEN SEVENTY THREE WILL HELP REMEDY THE FEARS BY WORKING WITH THE ICE IN HELPING PROTECT THE SURVIVORS IN THESE LOCATIONS -- AB TEN SEVENTY THREE RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN THE ASSEMBLY WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NINE VOTE. LET'S SEE IF THERE'S WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MARCO GEORGE THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU. TO THE JUDGE. CHAD ANDREWS WITH THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL LIBERTIES ADVOCACY ALSO IN SUPPORT. RIGHT ANY OTHERS ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SEEN. NINE A WE HAVE A MOTION. AND THE BILL IS. WE DON'T HAVE AMENDMENTS CORRECT IT WOULD BE TO PASS TO A PROBES. ANY OTHER COMMENTS WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I DON'T HAVE A SENATOR CHECKS IN WITH HIM I APOLOGIZE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUAL WORK ON THIS WHOLE ISSUE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE -- SOMETHING DEAR TO MY HEART FOR THE LAST. FORTY YEARS I HAVE TO ADMIT -- WE'VE NOT HAD ENOUGH SHELTERS WE'VE NOT HAD ASSURANCES THAT PEOPLE ARE SAFE IN THEIR SHELTERS SO THAT WE HAVE KEPT THEIR LOCATION SECRET. FOR PURPOSES OF SAFETY AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU ADDRESS THIS BUT ONE OF MY CONCERNS WAS -- HOW ICE KNOWS WHERE THESE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHELTERS ARE LOCATED IN THE FIRST PLACE -- BECAUSE THE INFORMATION SUPPOSED TO BE CONFIDENTIAL. NOT SUPPOSED TO BE DISSEMINATED AND PARTICULARLY THE HOSTILE FEDERAL AGENCIES LIKE ICE SO HOW HOW IS THAT ADDRESSED HERE FELT SO WITH MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THEY ARE ICE CAN ONLY FIND THE EXACT LOCATIONS. FOR ONE OF THE SHELTERS WITH A WARRANT OR A SUBPOENA -- NOTHING IN THIS BILL WOULD PREVENT THIS FROM OCCURRING WHEN ICE HAS OBTAINED A WARRANT AND SO THIS IF THEY DO FIND THE LOCATIONS THAN THIS PREVENTS ICE FROM INTERROGATING AND DOING ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WE DESCRIBED IN THE BILL. I'M YOU KNOW THAT IF ONE PERSON KNOWS AND EVERYBODY KNOWS AND I KNOW THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE KEPT SECRET BY UNDER SUBPOENA OR WARRANT -- RIGHT CAN OBTAIN THE DELIGHT YOU ARE SENSITIVE TO THAT IN ONLY IF THEY GET THAT IF THEY'VE THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO MEET THAT BAR. ARE THEY GOING TO THEN GET THE INFORMATION GAS. THANK YOU. ALRIGHT WITH THAT YOU CAN CLOSE THANK YOU I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.
