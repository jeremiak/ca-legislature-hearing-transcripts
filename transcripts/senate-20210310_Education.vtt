BUDGET ACT. IS THAT INCLUDEDI

00:40:13.477 --> 00:40:14.845

00:40:50.915 --> 00:40:52.983
EVERY HOPE TO. HAVE INCREASE

FUNDED BUT- I ALSO SAY. WE'RE

00:41:07.097 --> 00:41:08.432
PUTTING A LOT OF LOCAL CONTROL

00:41:08.499 --> 00:41:10.467

TO ANOTHER TOPIC THAT WAS BEING

WRONG THAT THERE'S- NOTHING IN

02:07:36.448 --> 02:07:38.250
CURRENT LAW THAT LIMITS THEIR

02:07:41.720 --> 02:07:43.222
BEING PROPOSED IN THIS BILL.

02:07:43.288 --> 02:07:46.058
UNTIL THE LOCAL LEVEL AT

02:07:46.125 --> 02:07:47.893
COMMUNITIES FEEL LIKE THEY WANT

02:07:47.960 --> 02:07:49.595
TO GO FURTHER THAN THAT

02:07:49.661 --> 02:07:50.863
DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENT THAT'S

02:07:50.929 --> 02:07:55.000
ALREADY ON ON THE AND THE LAW.

02:07:55.067 --> 02:07:57.236
THAT THEY COULD- ACT. ACTIVATE

02:07:57.302 --> 02:08:00.272
AND- AND ADVOCATE AND- AN AN

02:08:00.339 --> 02:08:02.775
APPEAL FOR. ADDITIONAL

02:08:08.847 --> 02:08:10.682
CLOTHES- BUT IT IS MY

02:08:10.749 --> 02:08:12.651
UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT- THAT

02:08:12.718 --> 02:08:14.353
AND WHATEVER THE WAY THE

02:08:14.420 --> 02:08:17.089
TESTIMONY FROM A WITNESS A FEW

02:08:17.156 --> 02:08:19.258
MOMENTS AGO INDICATING WHERE

02:08:19.324 --> 02:08:21.193
DISTRICTS HAVE NOT COMPLIED I

02:08:21.260 --> 02:08:22.461
THINK THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT

02:08:22.528 --> 02:08:24.730
ISSUE TODAY AND I THINK WE-

02:08:24.797 --> 02:08:26.231
NEED TO ENSURE THAT OUR SCHOOL

02:08:26.298 --> 02:08:28.734
DISTRICTS- FOLLOW THE LAW. AND

02:08:28.801 --> 02:08:30.803
IT IRRESPECTIVE OF WHAT HAPPENS

02:08:30.869 --> 02:08:31.904
ON THIS BILL TODAY I THINK THAT

02:08:31.970 --> 02:08:34.473
IT IS SOMETHING THAT- I WOULD

02:08:34.540 --> 02:08:35.908
WANT TO BE SURE THAT THAT IS

02:08:35.974 --> 02:08:38.677
FOLLOWED UP ON- BECAUSE THAT'S

02:08:38.744 --> 02:08:41.080
WELL WHAT WE EXPECT WE PASSED

02:08:41.146 --> 02:08:42.214
THOSE RULES AND THOSE

02:08:42.281 --> 02:08:43.615
REQUIREMENTS THAT THE DISTRICT

02:08:43.682 --> 02:08:45.050
WILL COMPLY WITH THE SITE I

02:08:45.117 --> 02:08:47.119
TAKE THAT VERY VERY SERIOUSLY.

02:08:47.186 --> 02:08:48.921
BUT FOR ME THE LIMITATION IN

02:08:48.987 --> 02:08:51.090
SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY IS

02:08:51.156 --> 02:08:54.660
THIS ISSUE OF LOCAL CONTROL I

02:08:54.726 --> 02:08:55.828
DON'T DISAGREE ABOUT

02:08:55.894 --> 02:08:57.863
TRANSPARENCY BUT IT SEEMS THAT

02:08:57.930 --> 02:09:01.366

02:09:05.037 --> 02:09:06.472
OVER REAHING AND IT'S A TOUGH

02:09:06.538 --> 02:09:07.573

SIMILAR BILL- AND FACT IT ENDED

03:14:15.844 --> 03:14:16.578
UP BEING A BUDGET BILL SO

03:14:16.644 --> 03:14:18.213
THAT'S WHAT REFERS TO AND

03:14:18.279 --> 03:14:19.547

03:14:37.098 --> 03:14:39.768
API ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE.

03:14:39.834 --> 03:14:41.503
SUPPORTING THIS BILL I DO AGREE

WITH CENTER CORTESE I MEET HERE

03:14:43.638 --> 03:14:44.839
WHAT THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNED

03:14:44.906 --> 03:14:46.741
ABOUT. BUT I DO THINK YOU KNOW

03:14:46.808 --> 03:14:48.043
THE PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING

03:14:48.109 --> 03:14:48.943
TO SAY IS EVERY STUDENT SHOULD

03:14:49.010 --> 03:14:50.845
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO BE

03:14:50.912 --> 03:14:52.914
ABLE TO GO TO UC RIGHT I MEAN

03:14:52.981 --> 03:14:56.818
WE THOUGHT. MOST- PROBLEMATIC

03:14:56.885 --> 03:14:58.787
WAS THAT- REASON WE DID. THE

03:14:58.853 --> 03:15:00.722
REGIONALLY- S. B. TEN FIFTY

03:15:00.789 --> 03:15:02.657
BACK IN TWENTY- BACK IN THE

03:15:02.724 --> 03:15:03.725
TWENTY SIXTEEN WAS IS THAT. YOU

03:15:03.792 --> 03:15:04.793
COULD BE A STRAIGHT A STUDENT

03:15:04.859 --> 03:15:06.127
AT A HIGH SCHOOL AND NOT BILL

03:15:06.194 --> 03:15:07.829
TO GET YOU SEE BECAUSE THE

03:15:07.896 --> 03:15:09.798
COURSES WEREN'T THERE. AT ALL.

03:15:09.864 --> 03:15:11.499
AND SO I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND

03:15:11.566 --> 03:15:12.200
THAT THERE MAY BE CERTAIN

03:15:12.267 --> 03:15:14.369
SCHOOLS WHERE THEY MAY BE DEBT

03:15:14.436 --> 03:15:16.037
BURDEN SOME FOR THEM GIVEN THE

03:15:16.104 --> 03:15:17.906
SPECIFIC POPULATION ADDRESSING.

03:15:17.972 --> 03:15:18.807
BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE AN

03:15:18.873 --> 03:15:20.408
AFFIRMATIVE PATH FOR ANY

03:15:20.475 --> 03:15:22.277
STUDENT WHO IS ABLE TO DO IT TO

03:15:22.343 --> 03:15:24.079
BE ABLE TO GET THE EDG COURSES

03:15:24.145 --> 03:15:24.579
THAT THEY CAN HAVE THAT

03:15:24.646 --> 03:15:26.981
OPPORTUNITY. TO BE ABLE TO MAKE

03:15:27.048 --> 03:15:28.016
IT THEY HAVE THAT THEY ARE

03:15:28.083 --> 03:15:29.951
TALENTED AND- WHEN THE WILL AND

03:15:30.018 --> 03:15:35.256
ETCETERA I NINA. SHE THE

03:15:35.323 --> 03:15:37.192
OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS. BUT I

03:15:37.258 --> 03:15:38.660
WOULD ALSO AGREE WITH CENTER

03:15:38.726 --> 03:15:40.929
CORTESE THAT. IT'S NOT JUST A

03:15:40.995 --> 03:15:42.564
CARVE OUT. IT'S SOME SORT OF

03:15:42.630 --> 03:15:43.965
COMMITMENT THAT THERE'S A PATH

03:15:44.032 --> 03:15:45.633
FOR THEM IF YOU KNOW IT'S NOT

03:15:45.700 --> 03:15:46.401
THAT PARTICULAR SCHOOL THAT

03:15:46.468 --> 03:15:48.103
THEY WILL BE FURTHER AWAY. SO

03:15:48.169 --> 03:15:50.138
THEY COULD GET THE AG IF THEY

03:15:50.205 --> 03:15:52.974
CAN DO IT- WELL I THIS IS A YES

03:15:53.041 --> 03:15:54.342
THAT MANY OF THEM AND MAY BE

03:15:54.409 --> 03:15:55.910
ABLE TO AND SO THAT THEY CAN

03:15:55.977 --> 03:15:57.278
HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO THEN

03:15:57.345 --> 03:15:58.947
PURSUE HIGHER EDUCATION ARE

03:15:59.013 --> 03:16:00.048

ANY OTHER COMMENTS I DO HAVE A

03:16:10.358 --> 03:16:12.827
COUPLE JUST TO VOTE TO FORCE

03:16:12.894 --> 03:16:16.131
CONVENIENCE FROM EDUCATION- I

03:16:16.197 --> 03:16:17.699
DO WANT TO PUT IN A PLUG RIGHT

03:16:17.765 --> 03:16:19.734
NOW I KNOW THAT THERE WERE SOME

03:16:19.801 --> 03:16:21.069
STUFF TO YOU STATED THE VERY

03:16:21.136 --> 03:16:23.238
BEGINNING ABOUT. ONLY A CERTAIN

03:16:23.304 --> 03:16:24.472
NUMBER OF STUDENTS GOING TO

03:16:24.539 --> 03:16:25.773
UC'S ARE CAL STATE IN

03:16:25.840 --> 03:16:27.509
CALIFORNIA BUT I DO WANT TO PUT

03:16:27.575 --> 03:16:28.843
IN A GOOD PLUG FOR A COMMUNITY

03:16:28.910 --> 03:16:30.545
COLLEGES AND THE EFFORTS THAT

03:16:30.612 --> 03:16:32.413
THERE HAS. THERE HAS BEEN IN

03:16:32.480 --> 03:16:34.082
THE STATE TO TRY TO ENCOURAGE

03:16:34.149 --> 03:16:36.050
OUR STUDENTS TO ATTEND A LOCAL

03:16:36.117 --> 03:16:37.919
COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND THAT

03:16:37.986 --> 03:16:38.520
MIGHT BE A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR

03:16:38.586 --> 03:16:40.421
IN THOSE NUMBERS- SO JUST

03:16:40.488 --> 03:16:42.123
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PUT

03:16:42.190 --> 03:16:42.857
THAT IN THE PUBLIC AS WELL BUT

03:16:42.924 --> 03:16:44.659
THEY KNOW THAT- OUR LOCAL

03:16:44.726 --> 03:16:45.827
COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE BEEN

03:16:45.894 --> 03:16:47.729
REALLY WORKING HARD TO GET OUR

03:16:47.795 --> 03:16:49.764
STUDENTS TO GO ON THAT ROUTE.

03:16:49.831 --> 03:16:52.333
FOR VARIOUS REASONS OF COURSE

03:16:52.400 --> 03:16:54.102
SO JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT

03:16:54.169 --> 03:16:56.671
ANOTHER CONCERN- THAT I HAD OR

03:16:56.738 --> 03:16:58.773
NOT THIS IS NOT IT GET THE

03:16:58.840 --> 03:16:59.841
PREVIOUS ONE WAS NOT A CONCERN

03:16:59.908 --> 03:17:02.210
BUT JUST A COMMON- THE ONE.

03:17:02.277 --> 03:17:04.145
OTHER COMMENT THAT I HAVE IS

03:17:04.212 --> 03:17:05.914
THE CHARTER SCHOOLS- WITH

03:17:05.980 --> 03:17:08.149
CHARTER SCHOOLS IT'S A CHOICE

03:17:08.216 --> 03:17:09.551
FOR PARENTS TO HAVE THEIR

03:17:09.617 --> 03:17:11.986
STUDENTS ATTEND TO THAT SCHOOL.

03:17:12.053 --> 03:17:14.689
AND TO MANDATE- I FEEL A LITTLE

03:17:14.756 --> 03:17:15.623
AWKWARD MANDATE IN CHARTER

03:17:15.690 --> 03:17:18.126
SCHOOLS- WHAT THEY CAN AND

03:17:18.193 --> 03:17:19.761
CANNOT DO BECAUSE IT'S OPTIONAL

03:17:19.827 --> 03:17:20.595
FOR PARENTS TO ATTEND THAT

03:17:20.662 --> 03:17:22.096
SCHOOL AND IF IT DOESN'T MEET

03:17:22.163 --> 03:17:26.134
THE REQUIREMENTS THAT THE. THEY

03:17:26.201 --> 03:17:28.203
THAT- EARNS WOULD LIKE THEN
