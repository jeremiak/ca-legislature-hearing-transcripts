TO BASIC CLOSE THE CHEAP GAP.

00:29:45.116 --> 00:29:46.050
AT THE TWO WE AGREE THAT THERE

00:29:46.117 --> 00:29:48.353
WOULD BE ACCOUNT. SURE THAT THE

00:29:48.419 --> 00:29:49.754
WAS GOING TO THE CHILDREN WAS

00:29:49.821 --> 00:29:51.656
AND TEN FOR. AND THIS WAS A AN

00:29:51.723 --> 00:29:53.358
EFFORT THAT WAS THE REALLY IN A

00:29:53.424 --> 00:29:55.059
VERY BY. MANNER AND I

WE ALL WORK AS A TWO TO MAKE

00:30:00.665 --> 00:30:02.300
SURE THAT KNOWING THAT. THERE

00:30:02.367 --> 00:30:02.901
WOULD BE SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:30:02.967 --> 00:30:06.471
IN WHAT I FROM. OR A LOT AREA

00:30:06.538 --> 00:30:08.973
THAT WOULD NOT GET OF THE KIND.

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:13.678
OF SUPPLEMENT GRANTS THE THOSE.

00:30:13.745 --> 00:30:15.647
EXPELLED VERY STRONG THAT

00:30:15.713 --> 00:30:18.516
CLOSELY KEEP GAP WAS EXTRA AND

00:30:18.583 --> 00:30:20.385
CAL. AND THAT THIS WOULD BE A

00:30:20.451 --> 00:30:33.097
THAT WE WOULD INVESTED THOSE.

00:30:33.164 --> 00:30:34.899
LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FOR ME

00:30:34.966 --> 00:30:36.201
BECAUSE I FELT AFTER FIVE OR

00:30:36.267 --> 00:30:37.135
SIX YEARS THAT WE SHOULD

00:30:37.202 --> 00:30:38.570
BASICALLY KNOW. WHAT WE'VE DONE

00:30:38.636 --> 00:30:39.704
WITH THE MONEY AND WHAT THE NOT

00:30:39.771 --> 00:30:40.605
THE MONEY IS GOING TO THE KIDS

00:30:40.672 --> 00:30:42.073
THAT WAS DESIGNED FOR.

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:45.310
UNFORTUNATELY AND SOUGHT AFTER

00:30:45.376 --> 00:30:46.678
LOOK AT THREE PFISTER'S CALL

UNFORTUNATELY THE AUDITOR A

00:30:49.614 --> 00:30:50.648
ROOF CAME TO THE CONCLUSION

00:30:50.715 --> 00:30:52.450
THAT WE PROBABLY MOST FEARED.

00:30:52.517 --> 00:30:53.685
THAT MOST OF THE MONEY WAS NOT

00:30:53.751 --> 00:30:54.786
GOING INTO THE AREAS AT THAT

00:30:54.852 --> 00:30:56.554
TIME THAT IT NEEDED TO GO. AND

00:30:56.621 --> 00:30:57.855
AS A RESULT THEY HAVE BEEN VERY

00:30:57.922 --> 00:30:59.190
LITTLE OVERSIGHT TO ENSURE THAT

00:30:59.257 --> 00:31:00.592

DOLLARS THAT WE USE WERE

00:31:08.833 --> 00:31:10.368
BASICALLY ROLLED OVER FROM YEAR

01:04:28.431 --> 01:04:30.266
NO STUDY SHOWING IT CORRELATES

01:04:38.574 --> 01:04:39.675
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF EVIDENCE

01:04:39.742 --> 01:04:40.977
TO THE CONTRARY THAT'S THE BEST

01:04:41.043 --> 01:04:43.212

THE SEA BASS IS WHETHER IT

01:05:27.223 --> 01:05:29.759

THERE'S ANY EVIDENCE THAT IT

01:05:31.961 --> 01:05:34.397
DOES. THIS WOULD ENHANCE

01:05:34.463 --> 01:05:37.333
FLEXIBILITY AND- IT'S IMPORTANT

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:38.401

MR MCCARTY. THANK YOU MISTER

01:21:47.002 --> 01:21:48.937
CUNNINGHAM I SUPPORT THE BILL I

01:21:49.004 --> 01:21:51.006
MADE THE MOTION THE AND AS YOU

01:21:51.072 --> 01:21:52.574
OUTLINED THE BILL YOU TALKED

01:21:52.641 --> 01:21:54.242
ABOUT HOW NOW IT'S RELATED TO

01:21:54.309 --> 01:21:56.077
CULTIVATE NINETEEN OF THIS

01:21:56.144 --> 01:21:56.911
THREE YEAR PEACE BUT WE WHEN

01:21:56.978 --> 01:21:58.546
YOU INTRODUCED IT IT WAS MUCH

01:21:58.613 --> 01:22:01.349
MORE- MUCH MORE BROAD CORRECT

01:22:01.416 --> 01:22:02.884
SO IT'S NARROWED AND YOU'VE

01:22:02.951 --> 01:22:05.387
YOU'VE TAILORED IT TO THE SPINE

01:22:05.453 --> 01:22:08.056
AT NUMBER OF YEARS. SO DO YOU

01:22:08.123 --> 01:22:08.623
THINK THAT ADDRESSES SOME OF

01:22:08.690 --> 01:22:10.759
THAT. OUT OUTSTANDING ISSUES

01:22:10.825 --> 01:22:14.429
AND CONCERNS. YEAH THAT WAS.

01:22:14.496 --> 01:22:15.897
THAT WAS THE COMMITTEES IDEA I

01:22:15.964 --> 01:22:17.232
THINK IT WAS A GOOD ONE WHEN I

01:22:17.299 --> 01:22:19.668
INTRODUCED THE BILL WAS- IT DID

01:22:19.734 --> 01:22:21.036
NOT HAVE A THREE YEAR SUNSET

01:22:21.102 --> 01:22:22.337
AND NOW WE'VE ADDED THE THREE

01:22:22.404 --> 01:22:24.706
OR SUNSET AND I THINK- THAT'S

01:22:24.773 --> 01:22:26.741
VALUABLE BECAUSE WE CAN SORT OF

01:22:26.808 --> 01:22:27.609
STUDY AND ASSESS HOW IT'S

01:22:27.676 --> 01:22:30.178
WORKING COUPLE YEARS OUT. AND

01:22:30.245 --> 01:22:32.681
LOOK AT WHETHER IT SHOULD BE

01:22:32.747 --> 01:22:34.015
EXTENDED AFTER THAT AND I

01:22:34.082 --> 01:22:36.451
THINK- TO YOUR POINT ABOUT THE

01:22:36.518 --> 01:22:37.752
CO THAT RELATIONSHIP THAT YOU

01:22:37.819 --> 01:22:38.687
KNOW THAT WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM

01:22:38.753 --> 01:22:40.889
ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO

01:22:40.955 --> 01:22:42.657
TAKE THIS TEST THIS YEAR AND

01:22:42.724 --> 01:22:44.826
THEREFORE THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO

01:22:44.893 --> 01:22:45.560
GET INTO THEIR CREDENTIALING

01:22:45.627 --> 01:22:48.163
PRO AND WE ALREADY HAVE A

01:22:48.229 --> 01:22:49.497
LOOMING SHORTAGE IN THE FACT.

01:22:49.564 --> 01:22:53.101
THAT THE SO I MEAN. WE HAVE TO

01:22:53.168 --> 01:22:53.668
SOMETHING OUT OF. THE PEOPLE

01:22:53.735 --> 01:22:55.103
THE- DON'T HAVE THE OP. TO TAKE

01:22:55.170 --> 01:22:56.638

DRESS IF. THERE IF IT'S OKAY OF

01:23:01.776 --> 01:23:03.144
THE CHAIR MAYBE SOME OF THE-

01:23:03.211 --> 01:23:04.813
ARGUMENTS. MADE BY THE

01:23:04.879 --> 01:23:06.715
OPPOSITION. BUT YEAH I WELL I

01:23:06.781 --> 01:23:08.149
WANT YOU THAT IN YOUR CLOSEST

01:23:08.216 --> 01:23:10.485

01:23:10.552 --> 01:23:10.985
OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE

01:23:11.052 --> 01:23:14.522
COMMITTEE MEMBERS I. MR KILEY.

01:23:14.589 --> 01:23:15.957
I'M NOT QUITE ALIGNED WITH-

01:23:16.024 --> 01:23:17.292
WHAT TIMES TO CUNNINGHAM IS

01:23:17.359 --> 01:23:18.660
TRYING TO DO HERE BACK I'D LOVE

01:23:18.727 --> 01:23:19.594

PROFESSIONS IN CALIFORNIA WE

01:23:24.065 --> 01:23:26.101
HAVE A THE MOST ONEROUS-

01:23:26.167 --> 01:23:28.970
BURDENS- TO ADD TO WORK IN

01:23:29.037 --> 01:23:30.105
CALIFORNIA OF ANY STATE ARE

01:23:30.171 --> 01:23:31.673
ROUTINELY RATED THAT WAY THAT

01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:33.341
THE REASON I'M GONNA UP STAYING

01:23:33.408 --> 01:23:35.110
FOR TODAY- IS I THINK THERE ARE

01:23:35.176 --> 01:23:36.845
SOME DISTINCT CONSIDERATIONS

01:23:36.911 --> 01:23:39.080
WHEN IT COMES TO ADD. AS OF THE

01:23:39.147 --> 01:23:41.983
EXISTENCE OF A OF TENURE LAWS

01:23:42.050 --> 01:23:43.551
WHICH ARE ACTUALLY- AND

01:23:43.618 --> 01:23:44.652
NATIONAL OUT WIRE HERE IN

01:23:44.719 --> 01:23:46.421
CALIFORNIA- FOR THE WAY THEY

01:23:46.488 --> 01:23:48.656
ARE STRUCTURED- WHICH MAKE IT

01:23:48.723 --> 01:23:49.991
DIFFICULT TO DO MEANINGFUL

01:23:50.058 --> 01:23:51.359
EVALUATION AND PROFESSIONAL

01:23:51.426 --> 01:23:53.361

01:23:57.065 --> 01:23:57.799
KNOW MISTER CUNNINGHAM MAKES A

01:23:57.866 --> 01:23:59.501
COMPELLING CASE THAT THE SEA

01:23:59.567 --> 01:24:02.404
BASS IS NOT A WELL ALIGNED. TO

01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:04.272

01:24:08.576 --> 01:24:09.978
ASSESSMENT AS WELL AS WITH

01:24:10.044 --> 01:24:11.246
REFORMING OUR TENURE LAWS IN

01:24:11.312 --> 01:24:13.681
CREATING A SOMETHING THAT I AM

01:24:13.748 --> 01:24:14.315
STRIPPING IS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF

01:24:14.382 --> 01:24:16.017
WHICH IS ALTERNATIVE PATHWAYS

01:24:16.084 --> 01:24:18.153
FOR FOLKS WITH ASSET TECHNICAL

01:24:18.219 --> 01:24:19.687

GET TENURE. THEY GET ON

01:24:30.131 --> 01:24:31.833
PROBATION OR STATUS. AWARE THAT

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:33.168

WITH THIS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT

01:24:40.308 --> 01:24:42.911
ONLY BECAUSE- YOU KNOW I THINK

01:24:42.977 --> 01:24:44.546
CLEARLY THE WHOLE ISSUE OF

01:24:44.612 --> 01:24:45.780
WHERE WE ARE NOW AND BEING ABLE

01:24:45.847 --> 01:24:48.183
HAVING TO SUSPEND TESTING IS

01:24:48.249 --> 01:24:49.417
REALLY HAD AN ISSUE IN A

01:24:49.484 --> 01:24:50.852
CONCERN. NOT SURE IF IT'S A

01:24:50.919 --> 01:24:52.187
THREE YEAR CONCERN BUT IT IS A

01:24:52.253 --> 01:24:54.722
CONCERN TEMPORARILY- AND IT'S

01:24:54.789 --> 01:24:56.024
NOT THAT DIFFICULT THE TASK

01:24:56.090 --> 01:24:57.091
BECAUSE YOU COULD JUST THE

01:24:57.158 --> 01:24:59.327
ACTUAL TESTING BIGGER ROOMS AND

01:24:59.394 --> 01:25:01.162
SPARE PEOPLE OUT AND SO. USING

01:25:01.229 --> 01:25:02.564
USING EVERYBODY SEEMS WILL USE

01:25:02.630 --> 01:25:04.666
COLD IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO

01:25:04.732 --> 01:25:06.201
SOMETHING THEY'VE ALWAYS WANTED

01:25:06.267 --> 01:25:09.070
TO DO- AND- AND SOMETIMES IT

01:25:09.137 --> 01:25:10.238
MATCHES AND SOMETIMES IT

01:25:10.305 --> 01:25:12.006
DOESN'T AND IN THIS IN THIS

01:25:12.073 --> 01:25:13.408
PARTICULAR CASE. I'M NOT SURE

01:25:13.475 --> 01:25:14.576
IF IT MATCHES BECAUSE THERE ARE

01:25:14.642 --> 01:25:16.244
WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN TEST FOR

01:25:16.311 --> 01:25:18.146
CBS AND THEY HAVE LOTS AND LOTS

01:25:18.213 --> 01:25:19.614
OF TIPS IF YOU SPREAD PEOPLE

01:25:19.681 --> 01:25:20.915
OUT IT'S NOT LIKE THEY HAVE TO

01:25:20.982 --> 01:25:22.150
INTERACT WITH INDIVIDUALS. THEY

01:25:22.217 --> 01:25:23.318
CAN SPREAD THE MOP THE

01:25:23.384 --> 01:25:24.452
CANDIDATE VARIOUS KINDS OF

01:25:24.519 --> 01:25:26.621
WAYS. MY CONCERN CONTINUES TO

01:25:26.688 --> 01:25:28.122
BE IS I'M NOT SURE IT AS IS

01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:29.991
POINTED OUT THAT THIS IS THE

01:25:30.058 --> 01:25:31.759
THIS IS ANY TIME THE BEST WAY

01:25:31.826 --> 01:25:32.894

WHICH ELEVEN. TEACH OF THE

01:25:55.984 --> 01:25:57.785
PROFICIENCY. AND I FIND IT

01:25:57.852 --> 01:25:59.521
DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT THAT

01:25:59.587 --> 01:26:01.089
I WOULD WANT THEM TO GOING TO

01:26:01.155 --> 01:26:02.857
TEACH ENGLISH MAP TO MY KIDS.

01:26:02.924 --> 01:26:04.592
WHEN THEY CAN'T PASS AT ELEVEN

01:26:04.659 --> 01:26:06.361
GRADING THEY'VE SPENT THE LAST.

01:26:06.427 --> 01:26:07.629
TWELVE YEARS OF HIGH SCHOOL AT

01:26:07.695 --> 01:26:09.197
LEAST FOUR OF NOT MORE AND

01:26:09.264 --> 01:26:10.965
COLLEGE AND STILL HAVE HAVE

01:26:11.032 --> 01:26:12.333
ELEVEN GREAT PROFICIENCY. IN

01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:14.802
ENGLISH AND MATH. SO I HAD LOTS

01:26:14.869 --> 01:26:15.870
OF FRIENDS WHO TOLD YOU KNOW

01:26:15.937 --> 01:26:17.405
CBS AS RACIST AS THIS IS THAT

01:26:17.472 --> 01:26:18.740
SO FORTH AND SO ON I'VE HEARD.

01:26:18.806 --> 01:26:20.408
ALL OF THOSE STORIES. AND I

01:26:20.475 --> 01:26:21.643
HAVE TO REMIND MY STUDENTS THAT

01:26:21.709 --> 01:26:23.211
EVEN IF I BELIEVE CBS WAS RACES

01:26:23.278 --> 01:26:24.812
THEY GOT A EUROPEAN EDUCATION

01:26:24.879 --> 01:26:25.480
WHEN THEY WENT TO THE

01:26:25.547 --> 01:26:26.981
UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. OR SEE

01:26:27.048 --> 01:26:28.917
ISSUE. SO IT'S NOT LIKE I SPENT

01:26:28.983 --> 01:26:30.285
THE WHOLE TIME- DISCUSSING

01:26:30.351 --> 01:26:32.320
BLACK LANGUAGE IN BLACK PEOPLE

01:26:32.387 --> 01:26:33.755
OR MEXICAN TO WHATEVER. THEY

01:26:33.821 --> 01:26:35.790
SPEND A VESTIGE. OF IT. THE

01:26:35.857 --> 01:26:38.326
ACADEMIC. STUDYING EUROPEAN

01:26:38.393 --> 01:26:39.928
CULTURE AND LANGUAGE MATH. SO

01:26:39.994 --> 01:26:42.564
YOU KNOW. IT'S A DIFFICULT

01:26:42.630 --> 01:26:43.865
THING FOR ME BECAUSE I DO THINK

01:26:43.932 --> 01:26:44.399
THERE ARE BETTER WAYS TO

01:26:44.465 --> 01:26:46.534
SURVIVE PEOPLE. I'M NOT SURE

01:26:46.601 --> 01:26:48.570
IF- IF THIS ISN'T. AN

01:26:48.636 --> 01:26:49.804
OPPORTUNITY JUST TO SUBSTITUTE

01:26:49.871 --> 01:26:51.906
WITH A CLASSROOM TESTS. AND

01:26:51.973 --> 01:26:53.708
HAVING SEEN STUDENTS. AS

01:26:53.775 --> 01:26:55.276
HAVING. SPENT FORTY YEARS OF

01:26:55.343 --> 01:26:56.778
UNIVERSITY. AND THINGS STUDENTS

01:26:56.844 --> 01:26:59.280
WHO ACTUALLY END UP IN MY CLASS

01:26:59.347 --> 01:27:01.282
OF SENIORS. AFTER HAVING THREE

01:27:01.349 --> 01:27:07.989
YEARS OF. SUPPOSEDLY SUCCESSFUL.

01:27:08.056 --> 01:27:09.390
ACADEMIC YOUR COLLEGE STILL

01:27:09.457 --> 01:27:11.659
ABLE. DO TO BE. WRITE AT A

01:27:11.726 --> 01:27:12.961
LEVEL FOR FIFTY I CAN.

01:27:13.027 --> 01:27:14.262
APPROPRIATE FOR SENIOR. IT

01:27:14.329 --> 01:27:15.396
DOESN'T ME A LOT OF HALF A

01:27:15.463 --> 01:27:17.065
DOZEN A THAT SOMETIMES STUDENTS

01:27:17.131 --> 01:27:18.499
TO A HATED THAT MY COLLEAGUE TO

01:27:18.566 --> 01:27:20.301
TEACH SO. I KNOW AND THEN I

01:27:20.368 --> 01:27:22.337
KNOW THIS IS A- SUPPOSED VICTIM

01:27:22.403 --> 01:27:23.805
FOR. BUT I WOULD HATE AS MOST

01:27:23.871 --> 01:27:25.940
THINGS DO WE PUT THINGS IN FOR

01:27:26.007 --> 01:27:27.375
THREE YEARS AND THEN WE- REMOVE

01:27:27.442 --> 01:27:29.010
THE SUNSET. AND IT BECOMES A

01:27:29.077 --> 01:27:30.612
THING AND WE NEVER DISCUSSED

01:27:30.678 --> 01:27:32.413
THE CRITICAL ISSUE OF HOW DO WE

01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:34.449
ENGAGE. IN CERTIFICATION OF

01:27:34.515 --> 01:27:35.917
TEACHERS AND I THINK THAT'S ONE

01:27:35.984 --> 01:27:37.385
OF YOUR CONCERNS TOO. HOW DO

01:27:37.452 --> 01:27:39.621
WE- DEVELOP A PROGRAM THAT'S

01:27:39.687 --> 01:27:40.688
BETTER AND I'VE SEEN SOME

01:27:40.755 --> 01:27:42.323
STATES ARE NOW GRAPPLING WITH

01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:44.158
IT AND DOING MORE IN TERMS OF.

01:27:44.225 --> 01:27:45.426
APPRENTICESHIPS AND SO FORTH

01:27:45.493 --> 01:27:47.662
AND SO ON AND- AND I'LL DIRECT

01:27:47.729 --> 01:27:49.097
EVALUATION OF NEW TEACHERS IN

01:27:49.163 --> 01:27:50.431
THE CLASSROOM AND DOING A WHOLE

01:27:50.498 --> 01:27:51.466
LOT OF WONDERFUL THINGS AND

01:27:51.532 --> 01:27:53.201
THEY- TALKED ABOUT IT HERE BUT

01:27:53.267 --> 01:27:54.202
THEY DO IN A LOT OF IT IN

01:27:54.268 --> 01:27:59.440
MICHIGAN. AND WE HAVE.

01:27:59.507 --> 01:28:01.175
CERTIFIED TO BE TEACHERS

01:28:01.242 --> 01:28:01.976
SUPPORT THEM WHILE THEY'RE

01:28:02.043 --> 01:28:04.045
THERE AND HAVE SOME SECURITY

01:28:04.112 --> 01:28:06.147
THAT WE CHOSE THE MOST FOLKS

01:28:06.214 --> 01:28:08.349
WERE READY FOR SCHOOL SO. I GET

01:28:08.416 --> 01:28:09.917
CONCERNED WHEN I SEE THE COLD

01:28:09.984 --> 01:28:10.485
WOULD BECOME THE ANSWER TO

01:28:10.551 --> 01:28:12.620
EVERYBODY'S PROBLEM. AND IT IS

01:28:12.687 --> 01:28:14.522
A PROBLEM AND IT IS A CHALLENGE

01:28:14.589 --> 01:28:16.924
OF BUT IT CAN'T BE THE ANSWER

01:28:16.991 --> 01:28:17.458
TO ALL THE THINGS THAT WE

01:28:17.525 --> 01:28:18.793
AFRAID TO ADDRESS. THAT'S MY

01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:23.297
CONCERN. THANK YOU- NO FIXING

01:28:23.364 --> 01:28:25.266
NO FURTHER COMMENT FROM THE-

01:28:25.333 --> 01:28:28.636
COMMITTEE. YOU MAY CLOSE.

01:28:28.703 --> 01:28:30.204
EFFICIENTLY PLEASE THANK YOU

01:28:30.271 --> 01:28:32.607
MISTER CHAIR OF DR WEBBER ALL

01:28:32.674 --> 01:28:35.076
AS TO THE COVERT ISSUE- MY

01:28:35.143 --> 01:28:36.210
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE TESTS

01:28:36.277 --> 01:28:38.112
WERE CANCELLED RIGHT THAT FOR

01:28:38.179 --> 01:28:40.915
THIS YEAR IN THE SPRING AT THAT

01:28:40.982 --> 01:28:43.184
AS OF MAY FIRST CERTAIN TESTING

01:28:43.251 --> 01:28:45.286
SITES WILL BE RE OPENED BUT

01:28:45.353 --> 01:28:47.055
THERE'S SOME TROUBLE WITH THE

01:28:47.121 --> 01:28:48.923
ROLL OUT OF THAT AND SO THERE'S

01:28:48.990 --> 01:28:49.624
AND IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER THE

01:28:49.691 --> 01:28:50.825
TEST IS ACTUALLY GONNA BE

01:28:50.892 --> 01:28:51.893
ADMINISTERED THIS YEAR REALLY

01:28:51.959 --> 01:28:54.362
ANYWHERE- SO. THAT'S THE IMPACT

01:28:54.429 --> 01:28:57.131
AND THEN- FROM COVERED NINETEEN

01:28:57.198 --> 01:28:57.732
THE THREE YEAR THING I MEAN

01:28:57.799 --> 01:28:59.600
THAT I GET THIS KIND OF SOME

01:28:59.667 --> 01:29:02.470
TIME TO GET THE CREDENTIALING

01:29:02.537 --> 01:29:03.104
COMMISSION TO. THE STUDY THAT'S

01:29:03.171 --> 01:29:04.639
FOR REAL. WHETHER THE YOU.

01:29:04.706 --> 01:29:06.607
SERVES A PURPOSE. AND WHETHER

01:29:06.674 --> 01:29:08.342
THAT PURPOSE AND WHETHER

01:29:08.409 --> 01:29:09.077
THERE'S VALUE IN IT THAT'S

01:29:09.143 --> 01:29:10.778
WORTH THE- YOU KNOW THE

01:29:10.845 --> 01:29:12.580
IMPEDIMENT. BECAUSE IT IS A

01:29:12.647 --> 01:29:13.748
PART OF SOME PEOPLE GETTING THE

01:29:13.815 --> 01:29:15.116
PROFESSIONAL COST MONEY TO TAKE

01:29:15.183 --> 01:29:17.585
IT. AND AGAIN THERE'S THEY PUT

01:29:17.652 --> 01:29:19.520
IT INTO LAW IN NINETEEN EIGHTY

01:29:19.587 --> 01:29:20.555
AND NOBODY'S EVER STUDY WHETHER

01:29:20.621 --> 01:29:22.790
IT WORKS. BY WORK I MEAN

01:29:22.857 --> 01:29:24.659
WHETHER THERE IS A- WHETHER IT

01:29:24.726 --> 01:29:26.127
IS A PREDICTOR OF TEACHING

01:29:26.194 --> 01:29:28.229
SUCCESS. AND WHERE THE REAL

01:29:28.296 --> 01:29:30.465
PINCH POINT JUST BE. COMPLETELY

01:29:30.531 --> 01:29:32.233
CANDID I THINK THE REAL PINCH

01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:33.668
POINT. ARE YOU HAVE FOLKS THAT

01:29:33.735 --> 01:29:34.702
HAVE TROUBLE WITH ELEVENTH

01:29:34.769 --> 01:29:37.772
GRADE MATH ON A STANDARDIZED-TESTS AND- THEY MAY BE FINE IF

01:29:37.839 --> 01:29:40.007
NOT THEY MAY. NOT BE OR BETTER.

01:29:40.074 --> 01:29:41.843
YET OR NAY ON THE COLLEGE LEVEL

01:29:41.909 --> 01:29:43.845
MATH COURSE WORK THE COUNTS. SO

01:29:43.911 --> 01:29:44.979
THEY THEY CAN DO IT IN THE

01:29:45.046 --> 01:29:46.280
CLASSROOM SETTING THEY THEY'VE

01:29:46.347 --> 01:29:47.648
SHOWN THAT NAY PROVEN THAT THEY

01:29:47.715 --> 01:29:49.283
CAN DO THAT. BUT THE GO TAKE A

01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:51.119
STANDARDIZED TEST AND SEE BEST.

01:29:51.185 --> 01:29:54.055
AND THEY AND THEY HAVE TROUBLE

01:29:54.122 --> 01:29:55.556
WITH THAT. AND THAT KEEPS THEM

01:29:55.623 --> 01:29:56.724
FROM GOING IN TEACHING LIKE

01:29:56.791 --> 01:29:58.559
FIRST GRADE OR SECOND GRADE OR

01:29:58.626 --> 01:29:59.160
THIRD GRADE WHERE THEY WOULD

01:29:59.227 --> 01:30:00.661
NOT HAVE TO TEACH. ELEVENTH

01:30:00.728 --> 01:30:02.363
GRADE MATH. THE BE TEACHING

01:30:02.430 --> 01:30:04.132
COUNTING AND STICKS AND BUNDLES

01:30:04.198 --> 01:30:05.299
AND- ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE

01:30:05.366 --> 01:30:07.068
YOU KNOW. MY YOUNGEST KIDS ARE

01:30:07.135 --> 01:30:08.803
LEARNING TO DO. YOU KNOW THAT

01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:11.005
OUR NEW- CURRICULUM THAT WE

01:30:11.072 --> 01:30:13.307
HAVE NOW MY DAUGHTER IS. DOING

01:30:13.374 --> 01:30:15.176
HOME SCHOOLING. AND THE

01:30:15.243 --> 01:30:16.644
TEACHERS MORE THAN WHAT WOULD

01:30:16.711 --> 01:30:17.979
NORMALLY HAPPEN TO ME I THANK

01:30:18.045 --> 01:30:18.846
GOD SHE'S A POSITION AND

01:30:18.913 --> 01:30:20.448
UNDERSTANDS IT. BUT IT REALLY

01:30:20.515 --> 01:30:22.216
GETS TO THE LOGIC OF MASS MUCH

01:30:22.283 --> 01:30:23.851
DEEPER UNDERSTAND THE MAP AND

01:30:23.918 --> 01:30:24.752
THAT'S A BIG CHALLENGE RIGHT

01:30:24.819 --> 01:30:26.154
NOW. IS THAT FOLKS CAN DO THE

01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:27.955
BASICS OF ONE TWO THREE AND ADD

01:30:28.022 --> 01:30:29.557
AND SUBTRACT. BUT WHEN YOU TALK

01:30:29.624 --> 01:30:30.992
TALKING ABOUT MATH AT A AT A

01:30:31.058 --> 01:30:32.326
DEEPER LEVEL IN TERMS OF THE

01:30:32.393 --> 01:30:34.128
LOGIC OF MATH. IF YOU'RE NOT

01:30:34.195 --> 01:30:35.763
GOOD AT MATH YOU ALMOST GO FILL

01:30:35.830 --> 01:30:37.165
THOSE KIDS IN IN IN THOSE

HER KINDERGARTENERS AND HER. A

01:30:40.368 --> 01:30:41.836
SECOND GRADER MATH AND SHE SAID

01:30:41.903 --> 01:30:43.838
IT'S MUCH DEEPER THAN SHE HAD

01:30:43.905 --> 01:30:45.606
THOUGHT BEFORE TONIGHT HE WAS A

01:30:45.673 --> 01:30:48.109
MATH AND SCIENCE MAJOR. US SO

01:30:48.176 --> 01:30:49.343
ACTIVEBUT WHAT I DON'T YOU

01:30:49.410 --> 01:30:50.645
KNOW I UNDERSTAND THAT THE TEST

01:30:50.711 --> 01:30:52.180
HAS NOT BEEN DONE DOES THIS

01:30:52.246 --> 01:30:55.383
BILL REQUIRED THEM TO. THE

01:30:55.449 --> 01:30:57.518
COULD I'VE- INTENTION WOULD BE

MAN IN THE BILL. THAT'S

01:31:06.694 --> 01:31:08.329
SOMETHING WE COULD ADD. TO IT

01:31:08.396 --> 01:31:09.463
I'D LIKE TO. SEE THAT BUT I

01:31:09.530 --> 01:31:10.665
THINK IF TO HAVE ME RIGHT WHERE

I THOUGHT THAT WOULD. MAKE IT

01:31:12.133 --> 01:31:15.169
HARDER. BUT IT'S PROBABLY WOULD

01:31:15.236 --> 01:31:17.572

PART THERE ARE MANY OF THEM

02:22:50.595 --> 02:22:51.896
HAVE BEEN VERY ACCESSIBLE WHEN

TRANSITIONING TO DISTANCE

02:22:53.197 --> 02:22:54.532
LEARNING AND THAT'S EMERGENCY

02:22:54.599 --> 02:22:56.034
IN PART BECAUSE OF THEIR

RELATIONSHIPS WITH VENDORS- WE

02:22:59.003 --> 02:23:00.805
I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE

02:23:00.872 --> 02:23:01.940
HAVE BEEN SOME ABUSES IN THIS

02:23:02.006 --> 02:23:03.708
AREA. WE THINK THAT THE

02:23:03.775 --> 02:23:05.276
COMBINATION OF THE VIGOROUS

02:23:05.343 --> 02:23:06.511
PROSECUTION THAT'S ALREADY

02:23:06.577 --> 02:23:09.080
GOING ON- PLUS THE WORK THAT

02:23:09.147 --> 02:23:10.949
WE'VE BEEN DOING AND SEE IF

02:23:11.015 --> 02:23:12.050
THEY AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN DOING

02:23:12.116 --> 02:23:14.252
THE MEMBERS- ARE STAMPING OUT

02:23:14.319 --> 02:23:16.788
NEARLY ALL OF THAT. AND WE

02:23:16.854 --> 02:23:18.523
BELIEVE THAT THE BILL AS

02:23:18.589 --> 02:23:19.757
AMENDED IS KIND OF A MASS

02:23:19.824 --> 02:23:21.993
FRANKLY IT WOULD SETTLE THE

02:23:22.060 --> 02:23:23.361
STATE SUPERINTENDENT WITH THE

02:23:23.428 --> 02:23:25.096
RESPONSIBILITIES THAT THEY'RE

02:23:25.163 --> 02:23:28.299
CLEARLY NOT- CAPABLE OF SEEING

02:23:28.366 --> 02:23:31.135
THROUGH. WE DO SEE SOME MERIT

02:23:31.202 --> 02:23:32.870
THEN THE SUGGESTIONS IN THE

02:23:32.937 --> 02:23:35.707
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS- WE DO

02:23:35.773 --> 02:23:37.075
SUPPORT THE NOTION OF HAVING A

02:23:37.141 --> 02:23:39.077
PROPER VETTING PROCEDURE. AND

02:23:39.143 --> 02:23:40.712
WE ALSO SUPPORT PROHIBITIONS

02:23:40.778 --> 02:23:43.348
ON- RELIGIOUS AND SECTARIAN

02:23:43.414 --> 02:23:46.351
INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS- BUT WE

02:23:46.417 --> 02:23:47.719
OPPOSE THE NUMBER OF THE OTHER

02:23:47.785 --> 02:23:49.020
SUGGESTIONS IN THE COMMITTEE

02:23:49.087 --> 02:23:51.856
ANALYSIS- FOR EXAMPLE THE

02:23:51.923 --> 02:23:52.690
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WOULD

02:23:52.757 --> 02:23:54.559
PROHIBIT PROVIDING INCENTIVES

02:23:54.625 --> 02:23:56.361
FOR. TEACHERS TO ENROLL IN

02:23:56.427 --> 02:23:58.396
RETAIN STUDENTS AND WE THINK IT

02:23:58.463 --> 02:24:00.465
CAN BE. ENTIRELY IMPROPRIETIES

02:24:00.531 --> 02:24:03.968
IF NOT- VERY HELPFUL TO PROVIDE

02:24:04.035 --> 02:24:05.670
INCENTIVES FOR TEACHERS WHO ARE

02:24:05.737 --> 02:24:08.673
UNUSUALLY SUCCESSFUL. WHEN THEY

02:24:08.740 --> 02:24:10.208
DO SO WITH STUDENTS WHO MIGHT

02:24:10.274 --> 02:24:11.976
OTHERWISE DROP OUT- MIGHT NOT

02:24:12.043 --> 02:24:16.381
BE. SIX ALL. AND SO THOSE

02:24:16.447 --> 02:24:18.850
ANOTHER REASON WE THAT THE BILL

02:24:18.916 --> 02:24:20.451
AND IT'S CURRENT. AND THEN THAT

02:24:20.518 --> 02:24:22.987
SUGGESTED AMENDED FORM- IT

02:24:23.054 --> 02:24:25.523
SHOULD BE HELD AND- SHOULD NOT

02:24:25.590 --> 02:24:26.791
MOVE FORWARD AND THEREFORE WE

02:24:26.858 --> 02:24:28.426

BACK IN BUT THERE'SNOT THERE'S

03:10:57.913 --> 03:10:59.281
SOME DIFFERENCES TIAS THAT I

KNOW THAT THAT THE FIRST OFFICE

03:11:00.782 --> 03:11:01.516

OTHER GROUP THE TESTIFIED.

03:11:12.661 --> 03:11:13.195
DIDN'T LIKE THAT PIECE AND SO

03:11:13.261 --> 03:11:14.796
THERE'S CONFLICTING MESSAGES

03:11:14.863 --> 03:11:16.298
FROM SOME OF THE OPPOSITION

03:11:16.364 --> 03:11:18.133
GROUPS AND SO I KNOW THE AUTHOR

THAT WE FOCUS ON THE OVERALL.

03:11:22.938 --> 03:11:24.873
GOAL OF THIS IS CLARIFYING

03:11:24.940 --> 03:11:26.575
STATE TAX DOLLARS TO PROTECT

03:11:26.641 --> 03:11:28.844
THE TAXPAYERS AND STUDENTS. AND

03:11:28.910 --> 03:11:30.111

DO THIS NOW IT'S REALLY- TWO

03:11:35.750 --> 03:11:37.586
SIDES OF THE COIN THOUGHT. IN

03:11:37.652 --> 03:11:39.187
THE COPA CRISIS SOME MAY SAY

03:11:39.254 --> 03:11:41.223
THIS TOO MUCH PAPERWORK GOING

03:11:41.289 --> 03:11:42.524
ON RIGHT NOW. IT'S SO WE DON'T

03:11:42.591 --> 03:11:44.125
HAVE ANY MORE BURDENS ON SCHOOL

03:11:44.192 --> 03:11:45.760
DISTRICTS IN CHARTERS-

03:11:45.827 --> 03:11:47.329

NETWORKS AS FAR AS- HOW TO USE

03:11:49.130 --> 03:11:50.498
THESE MONIES BUT ALSO IN THIS

03:11:50.565 --> 03:11:52.767
CRISIS THERE IS A NEED TO

03:11:52.834 --> 03:11:55.136
PROTECT TAXPAYER DOLLARS. RIGHT

03:11:55.203 --> 03:11:57.339
AND THE OTHER HAS WORKED. AS

03:11:57.405 --> 03:11:58.406
SPEND A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

03:11:58.473 --> 03:11:59.407
TIME OF THE CALIFORNIA CHARTER

03:11:59.474 --> 03:12:00.809
SCHOOL ASSOCIATION WORKING ON

03:12:00.876 --> 03:12:01.643
THIS BILL IN FACT THEY'VE

03:12:01.710 --> 03:12:04.579
CHANGED IN HELP. MODIFY THIS

03:12:04.646 --> 03:12:06.481
BILL INTO FASHION MORE TO THEIR

03:12:06.548 --> 03:12:07.716
LIKING THAT ON IN SUPPORT TODAY

03:12:07.782 --> 03:12:09.784
BUT EVEN THEY ALLUDED TO THE

03:12:09.851 --> 03:12:11.186
FACT THAT THERE ARE PROBLEMS.

03:12:11.253 --> 03:12:13.922
HOW HOME SCHOOL. SOME HOST

03:12:13.989 --> 03:12:15.390
SOMEONE ONCE A SENSE IT'S NOT

03:12:15.457 --> 03:12:17.559
ALL LET'S BE CLEAR SOME HOMES

03:12:17.626 --> 03:12:18.994
TO ORGANIZATIONS ARE SPENDING

03:12:19.060 --> 03:12:20.061
THEIR MONEY SO THE CHARTER

03:12:20.128 --> 03:12:21.029
SCHOOL ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN

03:12:21.096 --> 03:12:23.164
INVOLVED AND CONTINUES TO BE

03:12:23.231 --> 03:12:26.067
INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS- AS I

03:12:26.134 --> 03:12:27.535
UNDERSTAND IS THAT A FACT.

03:12:27.602 --> 03:12:29.437
CORRECT CORRECT AND AS I NOTED

03:12:29.504 --> 03:12:31.673
THERE IS ONE PROVISION THAT

03:12:31.740 --> 03:12:33.108
AMENDMENT THAT THEY TOOK IN

03:12:33.174 --> 03:12:35.343
THERE. RELATED TO INCENTIVES

03:12:35.410 --> 03:12:36.544
GOING TO TEACHERS WHICH WAS

03:12:36.611 --> 03:12:38.947
THAT THE SUGGESTION. OF THE

03:12:39.014 --> 03:12:41.082
ASSOCIATION AND THAT. PROVISION

03:12:41.149 --> 03:12:43.318
IN THERE IS NOW OPPOSED BY WHAT

03:12:43.385 --> 03:12:43.919
THE OTHER GROUPS OPPOSING HE

03:12:43.985 --> 03:12:46.588
BILL SO. SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO.

03:12:46.655 --> 03:12:48.356
SET TO SORT THIS OUT WITH AND-

03:12:48.423 --> 03:12:50.025
I THINK THE SHE STATED THAT SHE

03:12:50.091 --> 03:12:51.393
IS COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH

03:12:51.459 --> 03:12:52.427
THEM AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE

03:12:52.494 --> 03:12:55.196
PROCESS. AND I CAN'T IMAGINE

03:12:55.263 --> 03:12:56.564
LISTEN I'M A CLASSROOM TEACHER

03:12:56.631 --> 03:12:58.600
AND I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT I AS A

03:12:58.667 --> 03:13:00.669
TEACHER WOULD GET MONEY. FROM A

03:13:00.735 --> 03:13:02.237
SCHOOL DISTRICT OR AN OUTSIDE

03:13:02.304 --> 03:13:03.672
ORGANIZATION TO RECRUIT

03:13:03.738 --> 03:13:06.608
STUDENTS. INTO SOME OUTSIDE

03:13:06.675 --> 03:13:08.810
ACTIVITY I THINK THAT WOULD BE

03:13:08.877 --> 03:13:11.079
PRETTY NEFARIOUS WRONG AND-

03:13:11.146 --> 03:13:14.316
SETS UP A LOT OF BAD THINGS

03:13:14.382 --> 03:13:16.818
COULD COME OUT OF THAT. CORRECT

03:13:16.885 --> 03:13:18.119
ME IN I THINK YOU WOULD AGREE

03:13:18.186 --> 03:13:19.554
THAT IF THERE IS A VENDOR IN

03:13:19.621 --> 03:13:20.922
THE AFTER SCHOOL OVER THERE

03:13:20.989 --> 03:13:21.456
NEED TO BE OVERSIGHT

03:13:21.523 --> 03:13:22.991
ACCOUNTABILITY. THESE FOLKS

03:13:23.058 --> 03:13:24.025
MIGHT EVEN NEED TO BE

03:13:24.092 --> 03:13:25.293
BACKGROUND CHECK BECAUSE WHAT

03:13:25.360 --> 03:13:26.328
WE'RE DOING IS SENDING KIDS OFF

03:13:26.394 --> 03:13:27.963
TO MAYBE HORSEBACK RIDING

03:13:28.029 --> 03:13:30.799
LESSONS ETCETERA. HEY AND SOME

03:13:30.865 --> 03:13:32.300
THESE OPERATORS NIGHT MIGHT NOT

03:13:32.367 --> 03:13:33.902
EVEN HAVE BACKGROUND CHECKS SO

03:13:33.969 --> 03:13:35.136
I THINK I THINK WE NEED IT THAT

03:13:35.203 --> 03:13:36.671
CONVERSATION NEEDS TO BE HAD

03:13:36.738 --> 03:13:38.340
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS. THIS BILL

03:13:38.406 --> 03:13:41.476
IS ABOUT AND BOB IN ESSENCE

03:13:41.543 --> 03:13:43.411
SHOULDN'T BE PAID TO SEND THEIR

03:13:43.478 --> 03:13:44.579
KID TO A CERTAIN SCHOOL I MEAN

03:13:44.646 --> 03:13:46.915
THAT'S THAT'S IN SOME INSTANCES

03:13:46.982 --> 03:13:49.317
WHAT DOES BEEN ALLUDED TO IF

03:13:49.384 --> 03:13:51.252
YOU ARE GETTING A MATERIAL GOD

03:13:51.319 --> 03:13:52.754
TO SEND THEIR CHILD TO A

03:13:52.821 --> 03:13:55.423
CERTAIN INSTITUTION AND THAT IS

03:13:55.490 --> 03:13:57.459
NOT WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING.

03:13:57.525 --> 03:13:58.593
WITH PUBLIC TAX DOLLARS AND

03:13:58.660 --> 03:14:01.062
AGAIN I I'D I'D MAYBE I CAN'T

03:14:01.129 --> 03:14:02.297
SPEAK FOR ANYONE HERE BUT I

03:14:02.364 --> 03:14:03.932
DON'T THE ANYONE'S NECESSARILY

THE FUTURE IT MIGHT BUT AT THE

03:14:16.211 --> 03:14:17.545
SAME TIME I WANT. THESE GOOD

03:14:17.612 --> 03:14:20.315
GOVERNMENT PRACTICES IN PLACE
