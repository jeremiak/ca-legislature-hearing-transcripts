00:28:46.024 --> 00:28:47.592
SCIENTISTS SAY THAT DUE TO

00:28:47.659 --> 00:28:48.693
CLIMATE CHANGE THE AMERICAN

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:51.763
WEST IS DRIER THAN IT HAS BEEN

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:54.232
IN TWELVE HUNDRED YEARS OUR HOT

00:28:54.299 --> 00:28:56.234
AND DRY. IS YOU KNOW IS

00:28:56.301 --> 00:28:58.069
UNFORTUNATELY THE NEW REALITY

00:28:58.136 --> 00:28:59.838
FOR OUR FARMERS FOR RESIDENTS

00:28:59.904 --> 00:29:01.940
OF THE STATE. AND THEY NEED OUR

00:29:02.006 --> 00:29:03.675
SUPPORT YOU KNOW WE MUST DO ALL

00:29:03.741 --> 00:29:05.176
WE CAN ASK POLICYMAKERS TO

00:29:05.243 --> 00:29:06.878
UNDERSTAND THIS EVOLVING

00:29:06.945 --> 00:29:08.847
SITUATION OR THESE CONDITIONS.

00:29:08.913 --> 00:29:10.615
AND WORK TOGETHER. WORK

00:29:10.682 --> 00:29:11.783
TOGETHER TO ADJUST TO THIS NEW

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:13.918
REALITY AND THOUGH THE DROUGHT

00:29:13.985 --> 00:29:15.687
HAS THUS FAR MOST SIGNIFICANTLY

00:29:15.753 --> 00:29:18.723
IMPACTED FARMS ON THE NORTH

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:20.125
COAST AND IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY

00:29:20.191 --> 00:29:21.226
FARMERS IN THE SENATE DISTRICT

00:29:21.292 --> 00:29:22.760
I REPRESENT ARE STRUGGLING AS

00:29:22.827 --> 00:29:24.362
WELL AS THE SALAD BOWL THE

00:29:24.429 --> 00:29:26.764
WORLD FARMS AROUND THE SALINAS

00:29:26.831 --> 00:29:28.233
VALLEY AND WATSONVILLE IN

00:29:28.299 --> 00:29:30.034
SEMINOLE COUNTY THEY DEPEND ON.

00:29:30.101 --> 00:29:32.170
INEFFICIENT AND SUSTAINABLE

00:29:32.237 --> 00:29:34.672
STORAGE OF WATER- LONGER WAIT

00:29:34.739 --> 00:29:36.708
YEARS- AND THEY DO THIS TO GET

00:29:36.774 --> 00:29:38.443
US THROUGH OUR DRYER YEARS-

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:39.944
JUST RECENTLY I VISITED THE

00:29:40.011 --> 00:29:42.580
NACIMIENTO AND ST. OR THE U. S.

00:29:42.647 --> 00:29:43.515
SENATE TONIO DAMS IN THE COUNTY

00:29:43.581 --> 00:29:45.450
MONTEREY. AND THIS TRIP WAS EYE

00:29:45.517 --> 00:29:47.185
OPENING THE SEEN FIRST HAND HOW

00:29:47.252 --> 00:29:48.353
BOTH RESERVOIRS ARE AT

00:29:48.419 --> 00:29:49.921
CRITICALLY LOW LEVELS.

00:29:49.988 --> 00:29:52.390
NASCIMENTO'S AT 40% CAPACITY.

00:29:52.457 --> 00:29:55.093
SAN ANTONIO AT 7% CAPACITY

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.828
THAT'SUNBELIEVABLE 70%

00:29:56.895 --> 00:29:59.898
CAPACITY. AS A RESULT WATER-

00:29:59.964 --> 00:30:00.932
SOME RELEASES FROM THESE

00:30:00.999 --> 00:30:03.001
RESERVOIRS TO HELP RECHARGE

00:30:03.067 --> 00:30:06.871
AQUIFERS AND- AND HELP. PREVENT

00:30:06.938 --> 00:30:08.573
SEAWATER INTRUSION IN OUR

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.909
REGION- STOPPED TWO POINT FIVE

00:30:10.975 --> 00:30:12.710
MONTHS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. WHICH

00:30:12.777 --> 00:30:15.480
MEANS NO WATER WILL BE RELEASED

00:30:15.547 --> 00:30:17.649
IN AUGUST SEPTEMBER OCTOBER OF

00:30:17.715 --> 00:30:19.217
THIS YEAR NOW I ALSO RECENTLY

00:30:19.284 --> 00:30:21.085
VISITED SMALL FARMS AND- IN OUR

00:30:21.152 --> 00:30:23.021
DISTRICT- INCLUDING THE TARA

00:30:23.087 --> 00:30:24.189
MIKO ORGANIC FARM IN SAN

00:30:24.255 --> 00:30:25.890
MARTINE IN. THE SOUTHERN PART

00:30:25.957 --> 00:30:27.725
OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY. THEY

00:30:27.792 --> 00:30:29.093
GROW SOME TOMATOES AND A

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.295
VARIETY OF OTHER AND

00:30:30.361 --> 00:30:32.764
VEGETABLES. I WAS IMPRESSED AT

00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:35.133
THE RESILIENCE- ANY EFFORTS

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.335
THAT THEY HAVE MADE TO CONSERVE

00:30:37.402 --> 00:30:41.072
WATER- YOU KNOW BYE BYE-

00:30:41.139 --> 00:30:42.373
INCLUDING THE UTILIZATION OF

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.242
DRIP IRRIGATION TECHNIQUES IN.

00:30:44.309 --> 00:30:46.144
THE ROTATION OF CROPS. BUT

00:30:46.211 --> 00:30:48.346
WHILE THE- THE SALINAS IN THE

00:30:48.413 --> 00:30:49.714
BOROUGH VALLEYS MAY HAVE ENOUGH

00:30:49.781 --> 00:30:51.416
WATER TO LAST THIS SEASON.

00:30:51.482 --> 00:30:52.317
WE'RE CERTAINLY ALL WORRIED

00:30:52.383 --> 00:30:54.018
ABOUT THE TOUGH DECISIONS

00:30:54.085 --> 00:30:55.720
GROWERS WILL NEED TO MAKE NEXT

00:30:55.787 --> 00:30:57.488
SEASON AND IN THE YEARS AHEAD.

00:30:57.555 --> 00:30:59.424
TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:01.326
FEED NOT ONLY OUR STATE BUT THE

00:31:01.392 --> 00:31:02.961
REST OF THE NATION. AND THAT'S

00:31:03.027 --> 00:31:04.128
WHY I'M GRATEFUL TO HAVING THIS

ANOTHER SEVERAL YEARS OF

00:31:10.568 --> 00:31:11.135
DROUGHT WE MUST LOOK AT WHAT

00:31:11.202 --> 00:31:11.803
ACTION WE CAN TAKE THIS POLICY

00:31:11.869 --> 00:31:13.204
MAKERS IN THE NEAR AND LONG

00:31:13.271 --> 00:31:15.073
TERM TO ENSURE OUR STATE'S

00:31:15.139 --> 00:31:17.075
FARMERS CAN REMAIN RESILIENT.

00:31:17.141 --> 00:31:19.043
TO DROUGHT- AND TO ASSURE OUR

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:20.645
LIMITED WATER SUPPLY IS USED

00:31:20.712 --> 00:31:22.780
EQUITABLY AND RESPONSIBLY.

APPLICATIONS I'LL TRY TO BE

00:32:41.359 --> 00:32:43.428
BRIEFED OF REPORT TIME FOR TWO

00:32:43.494 --> 00:32:45.763
ONE DAY SINCE. WE'VE STARTED

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:47.498
LIKE LATE R. CALIFORNIA HAS A

00:32:47.565 --> 00:32:50.001
LONG HISTORY OF DROPS AND IT'S

00:32:50.068 --> 00:32:52.270
CLIMATE IS INHERENTLY I FELT

00:32:52.337 --> 00:32:55.139
PRO WE HAVE A LOT OF VERY

00:32:55.206 --> 00:32:58.009
ABILITY. ITSELF ACTUALITY IN

00:32:58.076 --> 00:32:59.777
CALIFORNIA HAS SOME OF YOU ARE

00:32:59.844 --> 00:33:01.913
PROBABLY QUITE AWARE WE HAVE

00:33:01.979 --> 00:33:03.948
MORE FLOOD YEARS AND DROUGHT

00:33:04.015 --> 00:33:06.517
YEARS FOR EVERY YEAR THAN ANY

00:33:06.584 --> 00:33:08.519
OTHER STATE OF THE UNION THAT

00:33:08.586 --> 00:33:10.521
MEANS WE ARE ALWAYS HAVING TO

00:33:10.588 --> 00:33:13.825
WORRY ABOUT- DROUGHTS AND

00:33:13.891 --> 00:33:16.761
FLOODS AT THE SAME TIME SO

00:33:16.828 --> 00:33:18.629
WE'RE WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO

00:33:18.696 --> 00:33:19.764
MANAGE TO WORK TOGETHER UP

00:33:19.831 --> 00:33:21.966
WATER AND WHAT YEARS AND

00:33:22.033 --> 00:33:23.935
STARTED RESERVOIRS AND AQUIFERS

00:33:24.001 --> 00:33:26.204
FOR DRY YEARS. WERE TRYING TO

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:28.639
MANAGE AGRICULTURE THIS CASE

00:33:28.706 --> 00:33:30.675
FOR BOTH OF THE DRY YEARS AND

00:33:30.742 --> 00:33:32.844
FOR FLOOD SO WE INVEST A LOT OF

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:35.980
LEVEES AND WE INVEST A LOT OF

00:33:36.047 --> 00:33:37.248
WATER MANAGEMENT. OVERALL IT'S

00:33:37.315 --> 00:33:40.518
BEEN A CONSTANT- OVER A HUNDRED

00:33:40.585 --> 00:33:42.587
FIFTY YEARS OF CALIFORNIA'S

00:33:42.653 --> 00:33:44.389
STUFF HELLO ECONOMIC

00:33:44.455 --> 00:33:48.459
DEVELOPMENT YOUR THIS YEAR AS

00:33:48.526 --> 00:33:49.660
WAS MENTIONED AS THE THIRD

00:33:49.727 --> 00:33:51.462
DRIEST YEAR AND MORE THAN A

00:33:51.529 --> 00:33:52.130
HUNDRED YEARS OF SUFFOCATION

00:33:52.196 --> 00:33:55.967
RECORD IT FOLLOWS ON LAST YEAR

00:33:56.033 --> 00:33:56.534
WHICH WAS A LYFT DRIVERS TO

00:33:56.601 --> 00:33:59.103
YOUR THE PRECIPITATIONARCTIC

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:02.106
SO. TO VERY DRY YEARS WITH THIS

00:34:02.173 --> 00:34:05.009
YEAR BEING EXTRAORDINARILY IN

00:34:05.076 --> 00:34:07.545
ADDITION TO THAT THE

00:34:07.612 --> 00:34:08.112
TEMPERATURES HAVE BEEN MUCH

00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:11.482
WARMER AND SO THE PRECIPITATION

00:34:11.549 --> 00:34:13.818
DOESN'T GET AS FAR ALL THE

00:34:13.885 --> 00:34:15.553
PRECIPITATION EVAPORATES BACK

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:18.089
UP INTO THE ATMOSPHERE BEFORE

00:34:18.156 --> 00:34:19.991
IT CAN MAKE ITS WAY INTO A

00:34:20.057 --> 00:34:22.660
STREAM INTO A RESERVOIR WATER

00:34:22.727 --> 00:34:25.263
RECHARGING AQUIFERS THIS IS

00:34:25.329 --> 00:34:27.231
ESSENTIALLY THE CHARACTERISTIC

00:34:27.298 --> 00:34:29.300
OF THE MODERN DROUGHT THIS

00:34:29.367 --> 00:34:32.537
DROUGHT OF THE ONE FROM TWENTY

00:34:32.603 --> 00:34:33.137
TWELVE TO TWENTY SIXTEEN BOTH

00:34:33.204 --> 00:34:36.574
WERE. MUCH WARMER CONDITIONS

00:34:36.641 --> 00:34:37.208
ONE I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE

00:34:37.275 --> 00:34:39.444
THAT IN THE FUTURE. THERE'S

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:41.312
SOME INTERESTING TALKING THE

00:34:41.379 --> 00:34:42.947
LITERATURE THAT DEMONSTRATES

00:34:43.014 --> 00:34:43.948
PRETTY CLEARLY THAT THOSE

00:34:44.015 --> 00:34:47.318
HIGHER RATES OF EVAPORATION

00:34:47.385 --> 00:34:47.852
MAKES SMALL DROUGHT IN THE

00:34:47.919 --> 00:34:49.520
BIGGER DROUGHT AND SO WE'RE

00:34:49.587 --> 00:34:51.189
GOING TO POTENTIALLY FROM THERE

00:34:51.255 --> 00:34:53.558
SEEING. LONGER AND MORE

00:34:53.624 --> 00:34:55.359
FREQUENT DROUGHTS THAN WE HAVE

00:34:55.426 --> 00:34:57.261
SEEN OTHERWISE IN ADDITION TO

00:34:57.328 --> 00:34:57.962
WHATEVER CHANGES OF

00:34:58.029 --> 00:34:59.664
PRECIPITATION PATTERNS WE MIGHT

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:01.566
SEE WITH CLIMATE CHANGE IS THE

00:35:01.632 --> 00:35:02.867
INCREASE IN TEMPERATURES ARE

00:35:02.934 --> 00:35:05.837
REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF WATER

00:35:05.903 --> 00:35:08.439
WAS AVAILABLE TO US THIS

00:35:08.506 --> 00:35:09.874
REDUCED ABOUT OF WHAT IS

00:35:09.941 --> 00:35:11.943
AVAILABLE TO US IN THIS DROUGHT

00:35:12.009 --> 00:35:13.744
BECAUSE OF COURSE AFFECTING THE

00:35:13.811 --> 00:35:15.446
SURFACE WATER AVAILABLE FOR

00:35:15.513 --> 00:35:17.782
AGRICULTURE ESPECIALLY IN THE

00:35:17.849 --> 00:35:19.584
SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY TOMORROW

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:22.119
GRAYSON BUT ALSO IN PARTS OF

00:35:22.186 --> 00:35:24.889
THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY AND THE

00:35:24.956 --> 00:35:26.224
SMALLER REAL OF THE RIVER

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:29.994
VALLEYS ABOUT- NAPA VALLEY AND

00:35:30.061 --> 00:35:33.764
SONOMA- RUSSIAN RIVER AMONG THE

00:35:33.831 --> 00:35:35.733
OTHER BASINS OF THE STOCK IS

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:36.934
THIS DROUGHT IS PRETTY PRETTY

00:35:37.001 --> 00:35:39.203
EXTENSIVE COVERING THE ENTIRE

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:40.938
STATE OF BIRTH OTHER PART OF

00:35:41.005 --> 00:35:42.373
THE CENTRAL VALUES WAS MUCH

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:43.541
MORE DROUGHT PRONE BECAUSE IT

00:35:43.608 --> 00:35:45.176
RELIES MUCH MORE ON IMPORTED

00:35:45.243 --> 00:35:47.345
SERVICE WATER. BURGER ALSO

00:35:47.411 --> 00:35:49.514
RIDICULOUS I HAVE ALSO BANNED

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:51.516
AS YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD MAJOR

00:35:51.582 --> 00:35:53.718
IMPACTS ON FOREST AND AQUATIC

00:35:53.784 --> 00:35:55.286
ECOSYSTEMS INCLUDING THE LOSS

00:35:55.353 --> 00:35:57.822
OF WHAT AROUND SALMON FELL

00:35:57.889 --> 00:36:00.024
SCREAMO SHASTA DAM. AND WE'RE

00:36:00.091 --> 00:36:03.127
SEEING OUR EXPANDED WILDFIRE

00:36:03.194 --> 00:36:07.899
IMPACTS WILDFIRE SEASON.

00:36:07.965 --> 00:36:10.134
COMFORTING THE ADDITIONAL

00:36:10.201 --> 00:36:11.569
PUMPING OF GROUNDWATER THAT'S

00:36:11.636 --> 00:36:12.803
HAPPENING BECAUSE OF REDUCE

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:14.171
SERVICE WATER SUPPLIES FOR

00:36:14.238 --> 00:36:16.807
AGRICULTURE YOU'RE SAYING

00:36:16.874 --> 00:36:18.342
BROUGHT OUT OF WORLD

00:36:18.409 --> 00:36:20.978
GROUNDWATER TABLES ONE THAT'S

00:36:21.045 --> 00:36:22.847
AFFECTING RURAL HOUSEHOLD WELLS

00:36:22.914 --> 00:36:24.282
AND SMALL COMMUNITY WELL SO WE

00:36:24.348 --> 00:36:25.750
HAVE QUITE A LOT OF SMALL

00:36:25.816 --> 00:36:27.184
PARTICULARLY POOR COMMUNITIES

00:36:27.251 --> 00:36:27.885
THAT ALREADY HAVE SHALLOW

00:36:27.952 --> 00:36:32.256
WELLS- BEING VULNERABLE TO

00:36:32.323 --> 00:36:32.957
THESE KIND OF ATTACKS WHAT

00:36:33.024 --> 00:36:35.493
COULD BE EXPECTED TO INCREASE.

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:39.564
BY NEXT YEAR TO REMAIN STRONG.

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:41.399
NEXT YEAR IS ALSO DRY ALL THE

00:36:41.465 --> 00:36:43.000
IMPACTS TO AGRICULTURE THE

00:36:43.067 --> 00:36:44.502
ENVIRONMENT AS WELL AS

00:36:44.569 --> 00:36:46.370
INCREASING IMPACTS URBAN AREAS

00:36:46.437 --> 00:36:48.973
SMALL TOWNS WERE AFFECTED. THIS

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.675
YEAR AND MORE LARGER STUDIES

00:36:50.741 --> 00:36:54.011
COULD BE AFFECTED NEXT YEAR ALL

00:36:54.078 --> 00:36:55.313
WILL BE WORKS THE WARMER

00:36:55.379 --> 00:36:56.914
TEMPERATURES CLIMATE OR

00:36:56.981 --> 00:37:00.351
WORSENING DROUGHT BOB AND

00:37:00.418 --> 00:37:03.521
REDUCING THEIR INCREASING THE

00:37:03.588 --> 00:37:04.121
AMOUNT OF WATER THAT HAS TO BE

00:37:04.188 --> 00:37:07.792
RELEASED TO PROVIDE COLD WATER

00:37:07.858 --> 00:37:09.727
FOR NATIVE COLD WATER FISH

00:37:09.794 --> 00:37:12.029
DURING THE DROUGHT SO WE'RE-

00:37:12.096 --> 00:37:12.530
PROVIDES QUITE A LOT OF

00:37:12.597 --> 00:37:16.300
CHALLENGES. NEXT YEAR IS MORE

00:37:16.367 --> 00:37:18.469
THAN USUALLY LIKELY TO NEED TO

00:37:18.536 --> 00:37:23.574
BE DRY THIS YEAR WE HAVE A VERY

00:37:23.641 --> 00:37:27.411
DRY WATERSHEDS WE HAVE GREATLY

00:37:27.478 --> 00:37:29.280
DEPLETED RESERVOIRS AS THE

00:37:29.347 --> 00:37:30.715
PREVIOUS SPEAKER MICHAEL OUR WE

00:37:30.781 --> 00:37:33.684
HAVE WATER TABLES WHICH ARE NOW

00:37:33.751 --> 00:37:36.053
MUCH LOWER WHAT'S THE WARMER

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:37.254
TEMPERATURES THAT WILL INCREASE

00:37:37.321 --> 00:37:38.422
ABOUT FOUR TRANSPORTATION

00:37:38.489 --> 00:37:40.758
BECAUSE WE LOOK FORWARD SO IT'S

00:37:40.825 --> 00:37:41.192
GOING TO TAKE MORE

00:37:41.258 --> 00:37:43.294
PRECIPITATION TO MAKE NEXT YEAR

00:37:43.361 --> 00:37:45.630
WET. I DON'T NORMALLY WOULD

00:37:45.696 --> 00:37:47.932
TAKE SO IT MAKES IT MORE LIKELY

00:37:47.999 --> 00:37:49.300
THAT WE'RE GOING TO HELP US

00:37:49.367 --> 00:37:50.968
ROUTE YOUR THAT WOULD REFORM

00:37:51.035 --> 00:37:53.004
FOR THOUSANDS TO PREVIOUS

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:58.809
PRIVATE I'M NOT A BIG CHANGE

00:37:58.876 --> 00:37:59.443
BROADER CULTURE I THINK IN THIS

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:03.214
DROUGHT RIVAS RELATIVES HOWEVER

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:05.016
CULTURE TENDS TO MAKE UP ABOUT

00:38:05.082 --> 00:38:08.419
TWO THIRDS OF ITS WELL DEFICIT

00:38:08.486 --> 00:38:08.886
BY PUMPING IT IS MORE

00:38:08.953 --> 00:38:10.855
GROUNDWATER WHAT THE

00:38:10.921 --> 00:38:11.489
SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER

00:38:11.555 --> 00:38:13.858
MANAGEMENT ACT THAT WATER IS

00:38:13.924 --> 00:38:16.060
GOING TO HAVE TO BE REPAID THE

00:38:16.127 --> 00:38:18.262
PASSED AWAY JUST WHAT CUMULATE

00:38:18.329 --> 00:38:22.099
AS LAND SUBSIDENCE. FROM WATER

00:38:22.166 --> 00:38:24.835
OVERDRAFT BUT WHEN YOU'RE A

00:38:24.902 --> 00:38:25.903
STABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:27.772
ACT. THAT WATER IS GOING TO

00:38:27.838 --> 00:38:29.707
HAVE TO BE REPAID IN WATER

00:38:29.774 --> 00:38:32.910
YEARS. BY MOSTLY BY REDUCING

00:38:32.977 --> 00:38:35.012
GROUNDWATER PUMPING WHICH IS

00:38:35.079 --> 00:38:37.314
GOING TO BE. REDUCING YOUR DATA

00:38:37.381 --> 00:38:39.316
COLLECTION THE LONG TERM. WE

00:38:39.383 --> 00:38:40.985
CAN EXPECT TO SEE PROBABLY HALF

00:38:41.052 --> 00:38:42.219
A MILLION TO A MILLION ACRES OF

00:38:42.286 --> 00:38:43.554
IRRIGATED LAND OUT OF

00:38:43.621 --> 00:38:45.623
PRODUCTION IN THE LONG RUN.

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:50.027
JUST TO ACCOMMODATE THE ENDING.

00:38:50.094 --> 00:38:53.931
OF OVER THE TOP OF THE SITE.

00:38:53.998 --> 00:38:54.999
SOME OF THE OTHER BIG THINGS

00:38:55.066 --> 00:38:55.833
THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SEE

00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:58.335
HOW LONG WITH A- ALL PRIOR YEAR

00:38:58.402 --> 00:39:00.237
MIGHT. OCCUR THIS COMING YEAR

00:39:00.304 --> 00:39:01.605
THERE'S ADDITIONAL URBAN WATER

00:39:01.672 --> 00:39:02.840
CONSERVATION WHICH HELPS A

00:39:02.907 --> 00:39:04.675
LITTLE BIT. BUT GIVEN THE

00:39:04.742 --> 00:39:07.111
RELATIVE MAGNITUDE MUCH GREATER

00:39:07.178 --> 00:39:09.280
MAGNITUDE OF BOB WATER USE

00:39:09.346 --> 00:39:11.282
AGRICULTURE THAT URBAN AREAS IT

00:39:11.348 --> 00:39:14.118
ONLY HELPS A LITTLE BIT WHAT WE

00:39:14.185 --> 00:39:16.153
WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO SEE NEXT

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:18.522
YEAR CONTINUES TO BE DRIEST

00:39:18.589 --> 00:39:22.693
EXPANSIONS OR LAND IDYLLWILD

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:24.095
WELL MOSTLY FROM LOWER VALUE

00:39:24.161 --> 00:39:26.263
CROPS WILL HAVE REDUCED

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:28.365
ECONOMIC IMPACT PROBABLY THE

00:39:28.432 --> 00:39:31.769
THING THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO

00:39:31.836 --> 00:39:33.971
DO MOST TO PREPARE US TO HAVE

00:39:34.038 --> 00:39:35.706
THESE MORE FREQUENT AND MORE

00:39:35.773 --> 00:39:37.408
SEVERE DROUGHTS OF THE FUTURE

00:39:37.475 --> 00:39:38.943
I'M TO KEEP AGRICULTURAL

00:39:39.009 --> 00:39:40.444
PROSPEROUS THROUGHOUT THOSE

00:39:40.511 --> 00:39:42.446
KIND OF EXTREME ABOUT. IS TO

00:39:42.513 --> 00:39:44.482
HAVE A MUCH MORE FORMAL. OUR

00:39:44.548 --> 00:39:45.716
WATER ACCOUNTING SYSTEM

00:39:45.783 --> 00:39:47.485
STATEWIDE ACROSS THE STATE

00:39:47.551 --> 00:39:50.087
AGENCIES THESE ARE NEEDED TO

00:39:50.154 --> 00:39:51.689
HEIGHTEN SERVICE WATER RIGHT

00:39:51.756 --> 00:39:53.324
MINISTRATION HOWEVER WHAT DOES

00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:55.126
HOW MUCH WATER THEY HAVE. FOUND

00:39:55.192 --> 00:39:58.796
USEFUL FOR SIGMA PLANNING AND

00:39:58.863 --> 00:39:59.330
IMPLEMENTATION AS WELL AS

00:39:59.396 --> 00:40:04.735
ENVIRONMENTAL WATER MANAGEMENT.

00:40:04.802 --> 00:40:05.936
ESPECIALLY IN THE FUTURE WE'RE

00:40:06.003 --> 00:40:07.838
GOING TO SEE WATER RIGHT

00:40:07.905 --> 00:40:08.439
CURTAILMENTS BECOME MUCH MORE

00:40:08.506 --> 00:40:11.142
TEETH SO THOSE. WATER RIGHT

00:40:11.208 --> 00:40:12.676
CURTAILMENTS ARE GOING TO BE

00:40:12.743 --> 00:40:15.179
MIRRORED YEAH RETIREMENTS AND-

00:40:15.246 --> 00:40:17.214
ALL GROUNDWATER AVAILABILITY ON

JAKE LAND BUT THAT'S NOTHING

00:40:55.886 --> 00:40:57.454
COMPARED TO THE PAIN THIS THING

00:40:57.521 --> 00:40:59.323
FELT WITHIN A REAL COMMUNITIES

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:00.925
ARE FARMING FAMILIES AND BY THE

00:41:00.991 --> 00:41:02.326
FARMWORKERS WHO DEPEND ON MANY

00:41:02.393 --> 00:41:03.594
OF THOSE ANNUAL CROPS THAT

00:41:03.661 --> 00:41:05.396
WERE. PLANTED AND IT'S VERY

00:41:05.462 --> 00:41:06.997

TO BE ABLE TO DISCUSS. WHAT

00:41:21.545 --> 00:41:23.147
MAKES CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE SO

00:41:23.214 --> 00:41:25.082
UNIQUE OTHER THAN WE ARE THE

00:41:25.149 --> 00:41:27.751

SCALE UP THE MOST EFFICIENT USE

00:43:29.073 --> 00:43:29.707
OF EVERY DROP OF WATER

00:43:29.773 --> 00:43:32.109
POSSIBLE. OVER THE LIFETIME OF

00:43:32.176 --> 00:43:33.844
OUR SWEET PROGRAM WE'VE BEEN

00:43:33.911 --> 00:43:35.946
ABLE TO REDUCE OUR GREENHOUSE

00:43:36.013 --> 00:43:41.819
GAS EMISSIONS. BY HUNDRED AND

00:43:41.885 --> 00:43:44.621
SEVEN THOUSAND. METRIC TONS-

00:43:44.688 --> 00:43:46.190
BUT THIS IS A WIN WIN PROGRAM

00:43:46.256 --> 00:43:48.292
NOT ONLY REDUCES GREENHOUSE GAS

00:43:48.359 --> 00:43:49.259
EMISSIONS BECAUSE WE'RE

00:43:49.326 --> 00:43:51.528
IMPROVING OUR ENERGY EFFICIENCY

00:43:51.595 --> 00:43:53.764
WE'VE ALSO BEEN ABLE TO SAVE.

00:43:53.831 --> 00:43:56.100
ALMOST A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY

00:43:56.166 --> 00:43:57.201
THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF WATER

00:43:57.267 --> 00:43:59.003
THROUGH THE USE OF THE MOST

00:43:59.069 --> 00:44:01.171
PRECISE TECHNOLOGY BUT HOW WE

00:44:01.238 --> 00:44:02.773
USE WATER. THAT'S THE

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:04.508
EQUIVALENT OF THIRTY SEVEN AND

00:44:04.575 --> 00:44:06.076
A HALF BILLION GALLONS OF WATER

00:44:06.143 --> 00:44:07.678
WHICH WOULD STILL SEVENTY

00:44:07.745 --> 00:44:08.912
OLYMPIC POOL I THINK IT'S

00:44:08.979 --> 00:44:11.215
IMPORTANT TO PUT THAT INTO-

00:44:11.281 --> 00:44:13.517
THAT KIND OF THE CONTEXT- WE

00:44:13.584 --> 00:44:15.419
ALSO RECEIVED FIVE MILLION

00:44:15.486 --> 00:44:17.054
DOLLARS FOR A NEW TECHNICAL

00:44:17.121 --> 00:44:18.922
ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. THAT

00:44:18.989 --> 00:44:20.791
SPECIFICALLY WORKING WITH

00:44:20.858 --> 00:44:22.693
GROWERS OF ALL SIZES IN ALL

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:24.328
PARTS OF THE STATE WITH MOBILE

00:44:24.395 --> 00:44:26.764
IRRIGATION LABS TO BE ABLE TO

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:29.666
CONTINUALLY IMPROVE. OPTIMIZE

00:44:29.733 --> 00:44:31.602
THE USE OF OUR WATER.

00:44:31.668 --> 00:44:33.771
IRRIGATION SYSTEMS ARE MAKING

00:44:33.837 --> 00:44:34.705
SURE THAT THE PUMPS ARE

00:44:34.772 --> 00:44:36.974
OPERATING AT MAXIMUM CAPACITY

00:44:37.041 --> 00:44:38.275
AND THE MOST ENERGY EFFICIENT

00:44:38.342 --> 00:44:40.577
WAY BUT THE DRIP LINES ARE ALL

00:44:40.644 --> 00:44:41.845
CLEARED IN THAT WERE. ABLE TO

00:44:41.912 --> 00:44:43.347
ANSWER QUESTIONS ON HOW TO

00:44:43.414 --> 00:44:45.315
IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE

00:44:45.382 --> 00:44:46.150
SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE ON THE

00:44:46.216 --> 00:44:48.185
GROUND. WE ALSO HAD TWO MILLION

00:44:48.252 --> 00:44:49.286
DOLLARS TO CONTINUE THEIR

00:44:49.353 --> 00:44:50.587
OUTSTANDING WORK THAT I KNOW

00:44:50.654 --> 00:44:56.293
THAT. YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT LATER

00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:56.960
IN THE LAST COUNT TO BE ABLE TO

00:44:57.027 --> 00:44:58.262
CATCH WHAT THE AND ARE IN EACH

00:44:58.328 --> 00:44:59.229
DROUGHT WHAT IT MEANS FOR JOB

00:44:59.296 --> 00:44:59.897
LOSS WHAT IT NEEDS FOR

00:44:59.963 --> 00:45:00.964
FOLLOWING WHAT IT MEANS FOR

00:45:01.031 --> 00:45:03.567
ECONOMIC LAST- AND THIS YEAR I

00:45:03.634 --> 00:45:05.436
AM VERY EXCITED THAT WITH THE

00:45:05.502 --> 00:45:07.204
GOOD WORKING LED BY SEE MORE

00:45:07.271 --> 00:45:09.173
SAD WILL ALSO BE CREATING SOME

00:45:09.239 --> 00:45:10.974
SUPPORT DECISION TOOLS TO HELP

00:45:11.041 --> 00:45:13.110
GROWERS MAKE DECISIONS ON

00:45:13.177 --> 00:45:15.579
TRADEOFFS IN FUTURE DROUGHTS-

00:45:15.646 --> 00:45:16.747
THE OTHER PROGRAM I WANTED TO

00:45:16.814 --> 00:45:18.415
TOUCH ON THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE

00:45:18.482 --> 00:45:20.050
RIGHT NOW IS OUR HEALTHY SOILS

00:45:20.117 --> 00:45:22.286
PROGRAM. MANY PEOPLE AGO WHY

00:45:22.352 --> 00:45:23.520
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT HEALTHY

00:45:23.587 --> 00:45:24.388
SOILS AND THIS IS ABOUT

00:45:24.455 --> 00:45:26.557
DROUGHT. BUT THAT WHOLE ISSUE

00:45:26.623 --> 00:45:28.225
OF WATER HOLDING CAPACITY IN

00:45:28.292 --> 00:45:30.461
OUR SOILS UNDERSTANDING HOW

00:45:30.527 --> 00:45:33.130
IMPROVING AND INCREASING SOIL

00:45:33.197 --> 00:45:35.099
ORGANIC MATTER. WILL ACTUALLY

00:45:35.165 --> 00:45:36.867
LEAD TO WATER HOLDING CAPACITY

00:45:36.934 --> 00:45:39.703
IN THE SOILS WE FIGURE THAT.

00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:41.805
FOR EACH 1% INCREASE IN SOIL

00:45:41.872 --> 00:45:44.842
ORGANIC MATTER. WE ARE MAKING

00:45:44.908 --> 00:45:47.344
AVAILABLE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND

00:45:47.411 --> 00:45:49.213
GALLONS OF SOIL WATER THAT'S

00:45:49.279 --> 00:45:52.249
THEREFORE USE LANCE OVER TIME

00:45:52.316 --> 00:45:54.618
THIS WILL DRAMATICALLY INCREASE

00:45:54.685 --> 00:45:57.387
OUR OUR RESILIENCY TO DROUGHT.

00:45:57.454 --> 00:45:58.655
IT'S NOT OVERNIGHT BUT IT'S

00:45:58.722 --> 00:46:00.557
IMPORTANT THAT WE STARTED BACK

ONE MILLION- DOLLARS OVER. SIX

00:46:08.198 --> 00:46:10.834
HUNDRED AND FIFTY PROJECTS- FOR

00:46:10.901 --> 00:46:12.236
REDUCTION IN GREENHOUSE GAS

00:46:12.302 --> 00:46:13.770
EMISSIONS OF A HUNDRED AND TEN

00:46:13.837 --> 00:46:16.473
THOUSAND METRIC TONS. VERY I

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:18.475
THINK VERY TELLING THAT WHEN E

00:46:18.542 --> 00:46:20.244
THINK ABOUT THE WAYS THAT WE'RE

00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:21.879
MAKING THESE INVESTMENTS WERE

00:46:21.945 --> 00:46:22.379
REALLY LOOKING FOR MULTI

00:46:22.446 --> 00:46:24.882

ON WEDNESDAY DECLARED DISASTER

00:46:39.496 --> 00:46:41.165
IT'S DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE

00:46:41.231 --> 00:46:42.866
DROUGHT MONITOR. THAT SHOWS

00:46:42.933 --> 00:46:50.374

WE'RE ALL CONTINUE TO RESPOND

PROFESSOR LEARNED. THAT THERE

00:51:33.490 --> 00:51:35.125
RUSSIAN RIVER WATERSHED WAS ONE

00:51:35.192 --> 00:51:37.727
OF THE MORE. EARLIER WATERSHED

00:51:37.794 --> 00:51:40.063
THAT WE UNDERSTOOD WORDS IN IN

BOARD. WHICH ARE RELAXATION OF

00:51:49.873 --> 00:51:51.575
ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS TO HELP

RESPOND TO WHAT WERE ALREADY

00:51:53.076 --> 00:51:54.945
DRY CONDITIONS LAST YEAR. AND

00:51:55.011 --> 00:51:57.614
SO WE'VE HAD TO RESPOND HERE A

00:51:57.681 --> 00:51:59.349
QUICK FASHION TO WORSENING

00:51:59.416 --> 00:51:59.883
DROUGHT CONDITIONS IN THE

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:02.719
SPRING. WE FOUND AS AS

00:52:02.786 --> 00:52:04.721
PROFESSOR LINE COVERED AT

00:52:04.788 --> 00:52:06.122
NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:52:06.189 --> 00:52:07.023
ACRE FEET. ARE NOT

00:52:07.090 --> 00:52:09.292
MATERIALIZING WITHIN THE MAJOR

00:52:09.359 --> 00:52:10.927
RESERVOIRS OF OUR STATE WATER

00:52:10.994 --> 00:52:12.229
PROJECT AND CENTRAL VALLEY

00:52:12.295 --> 00:52:14.064
PROJECT. THAT QUICK THE

00:52:14.130 --> 00:52:15.232
DEEPENING OF DROUGHT IT'S

00:52:15.298 --> 00:52:17.234
SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE NEVER

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:17.934
SEEN AND IS REALLY

00:52:18.001 --> 00:52:20.036
CHARACTERIZING. WHAT IS THE

00:52:20.103 --> 00:52:21.771
SCOPE OF WORK THAT WE HAVE THE-

00:52:21.838 --> 00:52:23.840
ABILITY TO SPREAD OVER A YEAR

00:52:23.907 --> 00:52:25.642
YEAR AND A HALF IF YOU LOOK AT

00:52:25.709 --> 00:52:27.143
THE CONDITIONS AS THEY SLOWLY

00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:28.612
ENCROACHED ON THE LAST DROUGHT.

00:52:28.678 --> 00:52:29.846
AND COMPRESS THEM HERE IN THE

00:52:29.913 --> 00:52:32.249
SUMMER AND TAKE EXTRAORDINARY

00:52:32.315 --> 00:52:34.317
ACTION- WHEN IT COMES TO. THE

00:52:34.384 --> 00:52:36.052
CURTAILING CLOUT WATER RATES

00:52:36.119 --> 00:52:38.188
AND I WATERSHED. THAT'S BECAUSE

00:52:38.255 --> 00:52:39.422
AGAIN TRYING TO MAKE SURE WE'RE

00:52:39.489 --> 00:52:41.224
PREPARING FOR A DRY WINTER WE

00:52:41.291 --> 00:52:42.459
WANT TO KEEP AS MUCH WATER IN

00:52:42.526 --> 00:52:44.928
OUR RESERVOIRS AS WE CAN NOW.

00:52:44.995 --> 00:52:46.596
WE KNOW THAT CONDITIONS ARE AS

00:52:46.663 --> 00:52:47.864
FAST AS THEY WILL BE AT LEAST

00:52:47.931 --> 00:52:49.032
UNTIL WE START TO SEE ANY

00:52:49.099 --> 00:52:50.567
RELIEF IF WE CAN DO. AND THE

00:52:50.634 --> 00:52:51.935
NEW WATER HERE AND IT'S SO

00:52:52.002 --> 00:52:53.303
IMPORTANT THAT WE ALL

00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:55.639
COLLECTIVELY ARE CONTRIBUTING

00:52:55.705 --> 00:52:57.307
TO OUR SUCCESS HERE. AND THAT'S

00:52:57.374 --> 00:52:59.376
REALLY THE STORY OF CALIFORNIA.

00:52:59.442 --> 00:53:00.877
IS A COLLECTIVE SUCCESS THAT

00:53:00.944 --> 00:53:03.246
WE- ARE ALL ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE

00:53:03.313 --> 00:53:04.180
WHEN IT COMES TO THAT VERY

00:53:04.247 --> 00:53:05.415
ABILITY THAT PROFESSOR LINE

00:53:05.482 --> 00:53:07.684
DISCUSSED. THAT THAT SWINGING

00:53:07.751 --> 00:53:09.553
BETWEEN DROUGHT AND FLOOD AND

00:53:09.619 --> 00:53:10.921
WE KNOW WITH CLIMATE CHANGE

00:53:10.987 --> 00:53:13.156
THAT SWING BETWEEN THOSE TWO.

00:53:13.223 --> 00:53:14.291
THOSE TWO STATES ARE ONLY GOING

00:53:14.357 --> 00:53:15.625
TO GROW MORE INTENSE WE'LL HAVE

00:53:15.692 --> 00:53:17.894
DRIER DROUGHTS. WE HAVE A WATER

00:53:17.961 --> 00:53:23.500
SYSTEM. TRULY THAT WAS BUILT TO

00:53:23.567 --> 00:53:24.100
THE TWENTIETH CENTURY AND WE

00:53:24.167 --> 00:53:24.668
ARE NOW IN THE TWENTY FOUR

00:53:24.734 --> 00:53:25.168
CENTURY WITH TWENTY FOUR

00:53:25.235 --> 00:53:26.202
CENTURY AND TWENTY FIRST CHAO

00:53:26.269 --> 00:53:28.872
SO IT'S ALL UPON US ABOUT HOW.

00:53:28.939 --> 00:53:30.807
TO BEST. COLLECTIVELY WORK

00:53:30.874 --> 00:53:32.576
THROUGH HOW WE WILL VIEW THESE

00:53:32.642 --> 00:53:34.611
CHALLENGES AND REALLY SEE THEM

00:53:34.678 --> 00:53:36.012
AS A GENERATIONAL OPPORTUNITY

00:53:36.079 --> 00:53:37.080
TO REINVEST IN OUR WATER

00:53:37.147 --> 00:53:39.182
SYSTEMS. TO RETHINK HOW WE MADE

00:53:39.249 --> 00:53:40.450
MATT MIGHT MANAGE IN THE FACE

00:53:40.517 --> 00:53:42.319
OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS. WITH

00:53:42.385 --> 00:53:43.386
DEEPENING DROPS AND NO MORE

00:53:43.453 --> 00:53:44.988
IMPORTANT DISCUSSION IS WITH

00:53:45.055 --> 00:53:46.423
OUR AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY

00:53:46.489 --> 00:53:48.058
WHERE WE KNOW PARTICULARLY IN

00:53:48.124 --> 00:53:49.392
RURAL COMMUNITIES. THE

00:53:49.459 --> 00:53:50.660
INTERSECTION BETWEEN DRINKING

00:53:50.727 --> 00:53:53.163
WATER ACCESS AND- AND

00:53:53.229 --> 00:53:55.065
AGRICULTURE ARE SO IMPORTANT.

00:53:55.131 --> 00:53:56.132
THAT WE NEED TO SEE OUR

00:53:56.199 --> 00:53:58.001
COMMUNITIES HOLISTICALLY HERE.

00:53:58.068 --> 00:54:00.870
AND IMPORTANTLY BRING BRING THE

00:54:00.937 --> 00:54:01.972
BRING TO BEAR THE SORT OF

00:54:02.038 --> 00:54:03.273
DECISION MAKING THAT WE ALL

00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:04.341
COLLECTIVELY HAVE TO

00:54:04.407 --> 00:54:06.476
DEMONSTRATE. IN THIS DROUGHT AS

00:54:06.543 --> 00:54:08.478
THE PROFESSOR SAID WE DO NEED

00:54:08.545 --> 00:54:09.646
TO GET MORE DATA BE MORE

00:54:09.713 --> 00:54:11.514
GRANULAR AND BETTER MANAGE OUR

00:54:11.581 --> 00:54:13.083
WATER RESOURCES PARTICULARLY

00:54:13.149 --> 00:54:14.718
THE WATER RIGHT SPACE. INTO THE

00:54:14.784 --> 00:54:16.686
NEXT INTO THE YEARS AHEAD WE'VE

00:54:16.753 --> 00:54:17.721
GOT SOMEWHAT OF A LIGHT TOUCH

00:54:17.787 --> 00:54:19.022
OUR WITH ADMINISTRATION OF

00:54:19.089 --> 00:54:20.357
WATER RIGHTS IN THE STATE. AND

00:54:20.423 --> 00:54:21.224
IF WE'RE GOING TO MANAGE

00:54:21.291 --> 00:54:23.393
THROUGH YOUR DEEPER DROPS WE

00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:23.994
HAVE TO GET BETTER AT TELLING

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:26.596
THE DROPS. TIGHTENING BY THE

00:54:26.663 --> 00:54:27.831
ACTIONS OF THE MULTITUDE OF

00:54:27.897 --> 00:54:28.832
WATER RIGHTS HOLDERS AND

00:54:28.898 --> 00:54:30.634
WATERSHED. IN A WAY THAT MAKES

00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:31.968
THEM ALL COLLECTIVELY

00:54:32.035 --> 00:54:33.236
INDIVIDUALLY BETTER DECISION

00:54:33.303 --> 00:54:35.138
MAKERS BUT IMPORTANTLY AS A

00:54:35.205 --> 00:54:36.940
WATERSHED ALLOW US TO DO THAT.

00:54:37.007 --> 00:54:39.709
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE BRING

00:54:39.776 --> 00:54:41.611
ALONG COMMUNITIES AND- HELP.

00:54:41.678 --> 00:54:42.879
DEVELOP THE COMMON DECISION

00:54:42.946 --> 00:54:44.414
SUPPORT TOOLS NOT UNLIKE THE

00:54:44.481 --> 00:54:48.885
ONES THAT SECRETARY. ELECTIVELY

00:54:48.952 --> 00:54:50.286
FROM SOME GREATER RESOURCES

00:54:50.353 --> 00:54:52.055
TEST SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES.

00:54:52.122 --> 00:54:52.822
I'LL JUST SAY THAT I'M PROUD

00:54:52.889 --> 00:54:54.124
THAT THE STATE WATER BOARD HAS

00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:55.291
BEEN ABLE TO INVEST IN THE

00:54:55.358 --> 00:54:58.561
LAST. FIVE OR FIVE YEARS SINCE

00:54:58.628 --> 00:54:59.763
TWENTY SIXTEEN WHAT STRUCK. SIX

00:54:59.829 --> 00:55:01.231
POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN

00:55:01.297 --> 00:55:02.766

RECYCLING. WE HAVE TO BE MAKING

00:55:09.773 --> 00:55:11.274
THESE INVESTMENTS INTO OUR AND

00:55:11.341 --> 00:55:13.143
OUR COMMUNITIES AND THAT'S JUST

00:55:13.209 --> 00:55:15.178
A SMALL DROP COMPARED TO ALL

00:55:15.245 --> 00:55:16.346
THE LOCAL INVESTMENT THAT GOES

00:55:16.413 --> 00:55:18.548
ON. TO CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN OUR

00:55:18.615 --> 00:55:20.450
OUR OUR WATER SYSTEMS. BUT IN

00:55:20.517 --> 00:55:21.584
THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND

00:55:21.651 --> 00:55:25.789
THE FACE OF THE AMOUNT OF

00:55:25.855 --> 00:55:27.090
ADJUSTMENT WE NEED TO DO TO

00:55:27.157 --> 00:55:28.525
MAKE TO OUR MANAGEMENT. WE'RE

00:55:28.591 --> 00:55:29.859
GONNA NEED TO SEE GREATER

00:55:29.926 --> 00:55:31.728
INVESTMENTS IN IS WHY I'M I'M

00:55:31.795 --> 00:55:32.662
THANKFUL AND PROUD OF THE

IN THE GOVERNOR FOR THE ONE

00:55:34.898 --> 00:55:36.266
POINT THREE BILLION. THAT THE

00:55:36.332 --> 00:55:37.834
BOARD IS PROVIDED FOR

00:55:37.901 --> 00:55:38.902
INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS IN

00:55:38.968 --> 00:55:40.704
DRINKING WATER AND WASTEWATER.

00:55:40.770 --> 00:55:42.605
THOSE WATER RECYCLING PROJECTS

00:55:42.672 --> 00:55:44.541
THEY MAY NOT SEEM TO BE. SUCH A

00:55:44.607 --> 00:55:46.042
SOLUTION THAT AGRICULTURE CAN

00:55:46.109 --> 00:55:48.178
REALLY TAP INTO BUT THEY ARE

00:55:48.244 --> 00:55:49.446
AND THEY'RE EXAMPLES OF SUCCESS

00:55:49.512 --> 00:55:50.914
AS WELL. DELPORT TO WATER

00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:52.849

00:55:58.521 --> 00:55:59.422
WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO MAKING

00:55:59.489 --> 00:56:00.790
THOSE INVESTMENTS HAVE THE DOWN

00:56:00.857 --> 00:56:02.325
PAYMENT TO WHAT WE KNOW OUR

00:56:02.392 --> 00:56:04.427
LARGER FEDERAL DISCUSSIONS AND

00:56:04.494 --> 00:56:05.962
PREPARING OURSELVES HERE IN

00:56:06.029 --> 00:56:07.363
CALIFORNIA BUT IMPORTANTLY IN

00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:09.365
THE WEST AS WELL. FOR THE

00:56:09.432 --> 00:56:10.467
CHALLENGES WILL BE FACING

00:56:10.533 --> 00:56:11.935
BATCHES FROM DROUGHT BUT FROM

00:56:12.001 --> 00:56:13.903
FLOOD AND IMPORTANTLY THAT

00:56:13.970 --> 00:56:15.472
THERE ARE INVESTMENTS WE CAN BE

00:56:15.538 --> 00:56:16.806
MAKING AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO

00:56:16.873 --> 00:56:18.641

FIGURED THIS OUT BUT WATER

00:58:12.388 --> 00:58:15.225
BANKING CAPTION. RECHARGE FLOWS

00:58:15.291 --> 00:58:16.860
IS GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT

00:58:16.926 --> 00:58:18.328
PART BUT NOT THE ONLY PART OF

00:58:18.394 --> 00:58:20.129
OUR FUTURE GOING FORWARD. WITH

00:58:20.196 --> 00:58:22.732
THE REALITY OF SIGMA. IF WE IF

00:58:22.799 --> 00:58:25.068
WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A

00:58:25.134 --> 00:58:25.869
SUSTAINABLE FUTURE FOR THE LONG

00:58:25.935 --> 00:58:27.937
TERM. WE REALLY NEED TO

00:58:28.004 --> 00:58:28.905
CONTINUE THE WORK THAT'S

00:58:28.972 --> 00:58:30.273
HAPPENING ON THE SUSTAINABLE

00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:32.008
GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT ACT. I'M

00:58:32.075 --> 00:58:37.680
NOT AWARE OF ANYONE WHO'S WHO'S.

00:58:37.747 --> 00:58:38.481
PUSHING FOR DELAY AT THIS TIME

00:58:38.548 --> 00:58:40.383
DEFINITELY ALSO I'LL SEE IF THE

00:58:40.450 --> 00:58:41.985
INVESTMENT ARE ARE SIMPLY ARE

00:58:42.051 --> 00:58:43.987
DEFINITELY A MULTITUDE BUT CAN

00:58:44.053 --> 00:58:45.388
BE TWO FOLD THING IT'S ABOUT

00:58:45.455 --> 00:58:46.789
THE DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS AND

00:58:46.856 --> 00:58:48.224
THE SYSTEM THAT THAT CAN BAY

00:58:48.291 --> 00:58:49.959
DRINKING WATER TO COMMUNITIES.

00:58:50.026 --> 00:58:53.062
BUT ALSO. ON A LARGER SCALE HOW

00:58:53.129 --> 00:58:54.898
WATER IS MANAGED AND IN

00:58:54.964 --> 00:58:56.399
WATERSHEDS IN THERE THE

00:58:56.466 --> 00:58:58.968
SECRETARY PROCESS POINT WE NEED

00:58:59.035 --> 00:59:00.436
TO GET SMARTER AND BE ABLE TO

00:59:00.503 --> 00:59:01.871
IMPROVE THE CALL QUALITY AND

00:59:01.938 --> 00:59:03.072
CONDITION OF OUR GROUNDWATER

00:59:03.139 --> 00:59:05.575
BASINS. BECAUSE THEY SHARE THAT

00:59:05.642 --> 00:59:07.243
RESOURCE WITH DRINKING WATER

00:59:07.310 --> 00:59:08.945
AND IS SO CRITICAL FOR

00:59:09.012 --> 00:59:10.246
AGRICULTURE TO BE ABLE TO

00:59:10.313 --> 00:59:11.047
DEPEND UPON IT DURING A

00:59:11.114 --> 00:59:13.249
DROUGHT. IN THIS PAINFUL AND I

00:59:13.316 --> 00:59:15.251
KNOW IT'S HARD IS BUSINESS

00:59:15.318 --> 00:59:16.486
THINK MUCH CAN SEEM IN THESE IN

00:59:16.552 --> 00:59:18.154
THESE SPACES HERE I THINK IT

00:59:18.221 --> 00:59:19.455
JUST REALLY EMPHASIZES THE

00:59:19.522 --> 00:59:21.157
IMPORTANCE OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS

00:59:21.224 --> 00:59:23.359
TO REALLY. BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND

00:59:23.426 --> 00:59:24.494
HOW WE'RE GOING TO MANAGE THIS

00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:25.728
RESOURCE TO LOOK FOR THE LONG

00:59:25.795 --> 00:59:27.363
TERM KNOWING THAT IT'S SO

00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:29.432
IMPORTANT TO. AGRICULTURE AND

00:59:29.499 --> 00:59:30.900
PEOPLE LIKE COMMUNITIES AND

00:59:30.967 --> 00:59:35.204
IT'S AND IT'S UNDERSTANDING HOW

00:59:35.271 --> 00:59:36.773
WATER UNDERGROUND AND THEN BE

00:59:36.839 --> 00:59:39.075
ABLE TO MOVE IT WHEN IT'S FAIR

00:59:39.142 --> 00:59:41.444
THREE TIMES OF. OF FLOODS AND

00:59:41.511 --> 00:59:42.812
WHEN THERE'S ACCESS IT'S GONNA

00:59:42.879 --> 00:59:43.746
BE REALLY IMPORTANT AND THERE'S

00:59:43.813 --> 00:59:45.114
WATER RIGHTS COMPONENT THERE

00:59:45.181 --> 00:59:46.816
IMPORTANTLY WHERE WE NEED TO

00:59:46.883 --> 00:59:47.984
BETTER UNDERSTAND AND THE

00:59:48.051 --> 00:59:49.452
MOVEMENT OF THAT WATER WHO.

00:59:49.519 --> 00:59:51.421
BEST HAS PRIORITY IN RIGHT AND

00:59:51.487 --> 00:59:52.588
BEGIN TO REALLY WORK WITHIN THE

00:59:52.655 --> 00:59:53.923
WATER RIGHTS SYSTEM TO ENSURE

00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:55.725
THAT IF THEY'RE TO ADAPT TO

00:59:55.792 --> 00:59:57.093
CLIMATE CHANGE TO BE HERE WITH

00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:58.695
US AS A TOOL. AS OPPOSED TO

00:59:58.761 --> 00:59:59.862
IMPEDIMENT WITCHING QUICKLY

00:59:59.929 --> 01:00:01.931
BECOME IF WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

01:00:01.998 --> 01:00:02.932
DATA TO BE MAKING DIFFICULT

01:00:02.999 --> 01:00:08.037
DECISIONS. AROUND THOSE REAL

01:00:08.104 --> 01:00:09.138
CRITICAL PROJECTS THANK YOU AND

COUNTIES IN THE STATE OF

01:00:29.359 --> 01:00:31.327
CALIFORNIA. TO ME IT SEEMS

01:00:31.394 --> 01:00:33.896
LIKE- AS WE- YOU KNOW HAVE THIS

01:00:33.963 --> 01:00:34.831
FIVE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLAR

01:00:34.897 --> 01:00:36.866
INVESTMENT MAYBE THAT'S- THE

01:00:36.933 --> 01:00:38.601
STRATEGY WE PURSUE IS WATER

01:00:38.668 --> 01:00:39.602
BANKING AND EACH OF THE

01:00:39.669 --> 01:00:41.371
DIFFERENT COUNTY SO THEN. WE

01:00:41.437 --> 01:00:43.873
DON'T RUN INTO- SOME OF THE

01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:46.175
OTHER OBSTACLES OF.

01:00:46.242 --> 01:00:48.277
TEMPERATURES INFLOWS AND-

01:00:48.344 --> 01:00:50.613
TURNING ON THE BANKS THAT THE

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:53.316
WATER BREAK AT. THE PUMPS OF

01:00:53.383 --> 01:00:55.084
TURNING OFF THE PUMPS ARE NOT-

01:00:55.151 --> 01:00:56.786

01:01:00.423 --> 01:01:01.424
IT MAY BE THAT I'M HOPING

01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:02.091
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT GETS

01:01:02.158 --> 01:01:04.927
PURSUED AS WE- START DIVESTING

01:01:04.994 --> 01:01:06.062

SUMMERTIME YET IT WOULD BE

01:04:21.424 --> 01:04:22.992
REALLY MUCH MORE BENEFICIAL TO

01:04:23.059 --> 01:04:24.393
DIVERT WATER IN THE WINTER TIME

01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:26.329

FUTURE SIMPLEX INCREASE

01:04:41.544 --> 01:04:43.913
FLEXIBILITY AROUND THAT SOURCE

01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:45.815
STREAMLINING THE PROCESS EVEN

01:04:45.881 --> 01:04:47.583

HOW YOU BUILD UPON IT VARIES

01:04:59.395 --> 01:05:01.364
FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY AND IT

01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:02.798
CAN BE REALLY FRUSTRATING SO

01:05:02.865 --> 01:05:04.066
THERE HAVE BEEN BILLS IN THE

01:05:04.133 --> 01:05:05.835
LEGISLATURE TO STREAMLINE THAT.

01:05:05.901 --> 01:05:07.169
BUT IF YOU ASK FOLKS OUT IN

01:05:07.236 --> 01:05:09.272

WE'RE ENCOURAGING THAT SORT OF

01:05:36.132 --> 01:05:37.700
MOVEMENT FROM DIVERSION DURING

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:38.734
THOSE TIMES WHEN YOU KNOW

01:05:38.801 --> 01:05:43.306
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH DURING THE

ADMINISTRATION I THINK IT'S

01:05:51.781 --> 01:05:53.716
IMPORTANT THOUGH TO HAVE A

01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:55.918
DISCUSSION AROUND THE FACT THAT

01:05:55.985 --> 01:05:58.020

ABOUT HOW WE BETTER RESOURCE

01:06:09.298 --> 01:06:10.499

ALL THE CALLS ABOUT INCREASED

01:09:52.187 --> 01:09:54.790
WATER STORAGE MERELY GOING

01:09:54.857 --> 01:09:58.627
TOWARD SUBSIDIZING WHAT SEEMS

01:09:58.694 --> 01:10:01.130
TO BE AN UNSUSTAINABLE

01:10:01.196 --> 01:10:04.033
AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY AND SO I

01:10:04.099 --> 01:10:05.968

01:10:42.404 --> 01:10:43.839
MANY GENERATIONS FOR

01:10:43.906 --> 01:10:45.074
GENERATIONS INSTEAD OF

01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:47.543
CALIFORNIANS- IS THERE ANY

01:10:47.610 --> 01:10:52.848
EFFORT. TO FOCUS ON THE

01:10:52.915 --> 01:10:54.316
UNSUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL

01:10:54.383 --> 01:10:55.784
PRACTICES IN THE STATE OF

01:10:55.851 --> 01:10:57.019
CALIFORNIA SO THAT WE CAN

01:10:57.086 --> 01:10:59.121
ADDRESS AND REALLY YOU KNOW

01:10:59.188 --> 01:11:02.257
FACE HEAD ON THE REALITIES IN

01:11:02.324 --> 01:11:04.493
OVER THE THAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:06.195
THE REALITIES OF THE DROUGHT

01:11:06.261 --> 01:11:07.663
CONDITION THAT'S ONLY GOING TO

01:11:07.730 --> 01:11:10.099
GET WORSE- RATHER THAN JUST

01:11:10.165 --> 01:11:11.734
CONTINUE TO KICK THE- CAN DOWN

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:15.537
THE ROAD. SOMEONE THEN I'M

01:11:15.604 --> 01:11:17.573
GOING TO MAKE AN ASSUMPTION

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:19.208
THAT MAY BE DIRECTED TOWARDS

01:11:19.274 --> 01:11:21.410
THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.

01:11:21.477 --> 01:11:22.645
AND I APPRECIATE YOUR

01:11:22.711 --> 01:11:25.047
VIEWPOINT- IT IS CLEARLY

01:11:25.114 --> 01:11:27.950
SOMETHING THAT- AS WATER

01:11:28.017 --> 01:11:30.753
RELIABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY

01:11:30.819 --> 01:11:32.721
DICTATE MORE AND MORE THE KINDS

01:11:32.788 --> 01:11:33.756
OF CROPS WOULD GROW IN THE

01:11:33.822 --> 01:11:36.158
STATE. AT THAT ALREADY HAS OF

01:11:36.225 --> 01:11:38.260
THE LAST THREE DECADES. WE HAVE

01:11:38.327 --> 01:11:42.031
SEEN THE MOVEMENTS. OF BASED ON

01:11:42.097 --> 01:11:45.234
AVAILABILITY OF WATER SUITABLE

01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:48.637
SOILS AVAILABILITY OF LABOR.

01:11:48.704 --> 01:11:51.740
AND RETURNS ON INVESTMENT FOR

01:11:51.807 --> 01:11:53.842
THOSE FAMILY FARMERS MOVE TO

01:11:53.909 --> 01:11:55.644
HIGHER AND HIGHER VALUE

01:11:55.711 --> 01:11:57.813
SPECIALTY CROPS LIKE ALMONDS.

01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:59.415
THERE'S ALSO A MOVE TO GO TO A

01:11:59.481 --> 01:12:01.250
PROP LIKE ALMONDS BECAUSE WE'RE

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:03.018
ONE OF ONLY FIVE MEDITERRANEAN

01:12:03.085 --> 01:12:05.654
CLIMATES. AND REPRODUCE OVER

01:12:05.721 --> 01:12:07.423
80% OF THAT THE GLOBAL SUPPLY

01:12:07.489 --> 01:12:09.591
OF COMMONS. AND AS WE HAVE

01:12:09.658 --> 01:12:11.827
WATCHED ALMONDS MOVE NOT JUST

01:12:11.894 --> 01:12:14.730
FROM BEING A LUXURY. SNAP CROP

01:12:14.797 --> 01:12:17.166
TO BEING A VERY STRONG BASIS OF

01:12:17.232 --> 01:12:19.301
A PLANT BASED DIET WITH ALL THE

01:12:19.368 --> 01:12:21.537
WAYS THAT ALMONDS ARE NOW USED

01:12:21.603 --> 01:12:23.105
AS WELL AS OTHER TREE NUTS AND

01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:25.507
OTHERS. THERE HAS BEEN A NEW

01:12:25.574 --> 01:12:27.409
FOR ECONOMIC REASONS AS WELL AS

01:12:27.476 --> 01:12:29.111
THE ALMOND BOARD OF CALIFORNIA

01:12:29.178 --> 01:12:31.113
HAS A VERY ROBUST SUSTAINABLE

01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:33.048
AGRICULTURE PROGRAM. THEY HAS

01:12:33.115 --> 01:12:35.184
THAT GOAL BY TWENTY TWENTY

01:12:35.250 --> 01:12:38.320
FIVE. TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF

01:12:38.387 --> 01:12:40.689
WATER USED TO PRODUCE A POUND

01:12:40.756 --> 01:12:42.391
OF ALMONDS BY TWENTY PERCENT.

01:12:42.458 --> 01:12:45.260
THEY SET A SUSTAINABILITY GO BY

01:12:45.327 --> 01:12:47.496
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. CHIU

01:12:47.563 --> 01:12:49.431
IMPROVE THE USE OF

01:12:49.498 --> 01:12:50.766
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY PEST

01:12:50.833 --> 01:12:52.801
MANAGEMENT TOOLS BY TWENTY FIVE

01:12:52.868 --> 01:12:55.337
PERCENT. THEY HAVE SET A GOAL

01:12:55.404 --> 01:12:56.672
TO REDUCE WASTE FROM THE

01:12:56.739 --> 01:13:01.176
ORCHARDS. ZERO ZERO SO THEY ARE

01:13:01.243 --> 01:13:03.045
MAKING VERITIES SALE. ON

01:13:03.112 --> 01:13:05.080
SUSTAINABILITY BOTH IN THAT AND

01:13:05.147 --> 01:13:06.882
IN THAT REGARD AS HAS OUR DAIRY

01:13:06.949 --> 01:13:09.651
INDUSTRY JERRY HAS REDUCED ITS-

01:13:09.718 --> 01:13:17.092
USE OF WATER TO PRODUCE A.

01:13:17.159 --> 01:13:17.726
GALLON OF MILK BY 88% OVER THE

01:13:17.793 --> 01:13:19.928
LAST FEW CLASS PROCESSING OF

01:13:19.995 --> 01:13:21.563
IMPROVED THEIR WATER EFFICIENCY

01:13:21.630 --> 01:13:22.164
SO THAT THEY USE PERCENT LESS

01:13:22.231 --> 01:13:23.832
Y. BUT THEY AND THEIR BY

01:13:23.899 --> 01:13:25.901
PERCENT THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF

01:13:25.968 --> 01:13:27.736
RATIOS THAT ALLOW FOR LONG TERM

01:13:27.803 --> 01:13:29.838
SUSTAINABILITY. OF CROPS THAT

01:13:29.905 --> 01:13:31.140
CAN'T BE GRANTED THAT MANY

01:13:31.206 --> 01:13:33.575

THOUSAND ACRES OF DRYLAND

01:18:29.571 --> 01:18:31.206
FARMING AND NOT THEY DEPEND ON

01:18:31.273 --> 01:18:32.808
RAIN WATER TO CAPTURE INTO

01:18:32.874 --> 01:18:35.110
THEIR DAMS TWO WATER TOWERS AND

01:18:35.177 --> 01:18:37.479

01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:51.827
AND ONE- WE SAW IN DECEMBER

01:18:51.893 --> 01:18:53.295
THAT THERE WAS NOT GOING TO BE

01:18:53.361 --> 01:18:55.163
ANY RUN OFF THIS YEAR AND WE

01:18:55.230 --> 01:18:55.964
DECIDED TO START SELLING SOME

01:18:56.031 --> 01:18:57.766
COWS. KNOWING THATFEED COSTS

01:18:57.833 --> 01:18:59.468
WERE GOING TO BE HIGHER- ARE

01:18:59.534 --> 01:19:01.002
CASHIER WAS NOT GOING TO BE

01:19:01.069 --> 01:19:03.505
WHAT IT SHOULD BE- AND WE USE

01:19:03.572 --> 01:19:04.573
IT HERE IN SANTA ROSA AND THE

01:19:04.639 --> 01:19:06.074
CITY OF SANTA ROSA RECLAIMED

01:19:06.141 --> 01:19:08.210
WASTEWATER- AND THAT'S BEEN A

01:19:08.276 --> 01:19:09.744
GREAT PARTNERSHIP FOR THIRTY

01:19:09.811 --> 01:19:11.546
YEARS AND I WE GOT OUR INCHES

01:19:11.613 --> 01:19:14.082
CUT IN HALF- SAID KNOWING THAT

01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:14.716
ALL THESE THINGS ARE GOING TO

01:19:14.783 --> 01:19:16.284
BE COMING DOWN THE PIPELINE WE

01:19:16.351 --> 01:19:17.919
HAD TO MAKE SOME VERY- HARD

01:19:17.986 --> 01:19:19.754
CALLS. I'M AS WELL AS BE VERY

01:19:19.821 --> 01:19:21.957
DILIGENT AROUND US- WE ARE

01:19:22.023 --> 01:19:23.725
SURROUNDED BY CITY SANTA ROSA

01:19:23.792 --> 01:19:24.659
PROPERTY THAT NORMALLY IF

01:19:24.726 --> 01:19:26.495
YOU'RE GETTING IT AND- LESS

01:19:26.561 --> 01:19:27.696
THAN TWO WEEKS AGO WE HAD A

01:19:27.762 --> 01:19:29.564
FIRE ACROSS THE STREET. THAT

01:19:29.631 --> 01:19:31.199
ALMOST TOOK OUT OUR DAIRY AND

01:19:31.266 --> 01:19:32.400
HAVE THOSE LANDS BEEN YOUR

01:19:32.467 --> 01:19:34.236
GATED- I FEEL LIKE THAT WOULD

01:19:34.302 --> 01:19:37.105
HAVE SLOWED THE PROGRESS- BUT-

01:19:37.172 --> 01:19:38.507
WITHOUT WATER OBVIOUSLY RUNNING

01:19:38.573 --> 01:19:41.743
OFF TO THE PINES- WE DO NOT

01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:42.777
HAVE THAT WATER AVAILABLE FOR

01:19:42.844 --> 01:19:49.317
ALL THAT ACREAGE- WE. RELY ON

01:19:49.384 --> 01:19:49.885
GROWING MOST OF HER FEET. WE

01:19:49.951 --> 01:19:51.486
THE GIRL ABOUT HOW ACRES SILENT

01:19:51.553 --> 01:19:52.053
AND THEN TRY TO GO A SET AND

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:53.622
THIRD HAY THIS YEAR WE'RE

01:19:53.688 --> 01:19:55.690
ACTUALLY GOING TO BE. TRUCKING

01:19:55.757 --> 01:19:57.092
IN MORE HEY WE'VE HAD TO FEED

01:19:57.159 --> 01:19:58.994
OUR ANIMALS SOONER THAN NORMAL-

01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:00.929
BECAUSE OUR PASTURE LAND IS NOT

01:20:00.996 --> 01:20:03.031
WHAT IT SHOULD BE- FEED COSTS

01:20:03.098 --> 01:20:05.233
ARE. FLYING THROUGH THE ROOF-

01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:06.568
AND SO IT'S GOING TO BE HARDER

01:20:06.635 --> 01:20:08.503
FOR US TO. CONTINUE TO JERRY

01:20:08.570 --> 01:20:09.838
AND I FEEL LIKE THE IMPACTS ON

01:20:09.905 --> 01:20:10.972
THE DAIRY INDUSTRY IN THE NORTH

01:20:11.039 --> 01:20:13.275
COAST. HAVE YET TO BE SEEN IF

01:20:13.341 --> 01:20:14.910
WE DON'T GET RAIN IN THE WINTER

01:20:14.976 --> 01:20:16.144
TIME YOU WILL PROBABLY SEE

01:20:16.211 --> 01:20:17.345
MULTIPLE JERRY SPOT OF

01:20:17.412 --> 01:20:19.548
BUSINESS- BECAUSE THERE'S JUST

01:20:19.614 --> 01:20:20.615
PHYSICALLY NO WATER TO WATER

01:20:20.682 --> 01:20:22.684
THEIR ANIMALS. AND NO FEE

01:20:22.751 --> 01:20:25.987
DEFEAT THEM- ALSO ON THE U.

01:20:26.054 --> 01:20:27.522
TRUCKING AND FEED YOU KNOW WE

01:20:27.589 --> 01:20:28.857
IN THE DAIRY INDUSTRY HAVE TRY

01:20:28.924 --> 01:20:31.059
TO CUT EMISSIONS BY METHANE AND

01:20:31.126 --> 01:20:32.427
WE DO ALL THAT WE CAN BUT AS

01:20:32.494 --> 01:20:33.328
WE'RE TRACKING AND MORE FEET

01:20:33.395 --> 01:20:35.230
FROM OTHER STATES. ARE DOING IS

01:20:35.297 --> 01:20:36.598
INCREASING OUR MISSION BUT

01:20:36.665 --> 01:20:38.066
BRAND THAT'S NOT WHAT WE HAVE

01:20:38.133 --> 01:20:39.267
THE DAIRY INDUSTRY HAS TRIED TO

01:20:39.334 --> 01:20:43.705
DO- SO. WE ALSO DID EIGHT EYES

01:20:43.772 --> 01:20:45.540
CDFA WE ARE ONE OF THE CDFA

01:20:45.607 --> 01:20:47.309
IMPRINT THIS YEAR. AND WE'VE

01:20:47.375 --> 01:20:48.877
SEEN THE BENEFITS AND NOT AS

01:20:48.944 --> 01:20:50.111
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO REUSE A

01:20:50.178 --> 01:20:51.479
SEPARATED WATER OFF OF ARE

01:20:51.546 --> 01:20:53.181
SEPARATED IN YOUR BACK ONTO OUR

01:20:53.248 --> 01:20:54.916
FIELDS. SO THAT'S BEEN A GREAT

01:20:54.983 --> 01:20:56.618
PARTNERSHIP WE ALSO DID THE

01:20:56.685 --> 01:20:58.086
HEALTHY SOILS PROGRAM AND I

01:20:58.153 --> 01:20:58.954
WOULD LIKE TO KIND OF TOUCH ON

01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:00.288
WHAT SECRETARY ROSS TALKED

01:21:00.355 --> 01:21:01.556
ABOUT WITH ALL THE PROGRAMS AND

01:21:01.623 --> 01:21:03.191
FUNDING. I WOULD HAVE TO SAY

01:21:03.258 --> 01:21:05.360
THAT AS WE PUSH THESE PROGRAMS-

01:21:05.427 --> 01:21:07.295
TO HOPEFULLY. HOLD OUR CDFA

01:21:07.362 --> 01:21:08.763
ACCOUNTABLE AND HOLD USD

01:21:08.830 --> 01:21:10.298
ACCOUNTABLE BECAUSE THE HEALTHY

01:21:10.365 --> 01:21:12.133
SOILS PROGRAM. WAS ONE OF THE

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:13.168
HARDEST PROGRAMS I'VE EVER

01:21:13.235 --> 01:21:14.636
DEALT WITH NOT ONLY TO GET OUR

01:21:14.703 --> 01:21:16.671
FUNDS. BUT WHEN IT CAME TO

01:21:16.738 --> 01:21:17.939
DURING KOBE TIME JUST GETTING A

01:21:18.006 --> 01:21:19.841
RESPONSE BACK. FROM WHO I WAS

01:21:19.908 --> 01:21:21.977
WORKING WITH AND USDA WE'VE HAD

01:21:22.043 --> 01:21:23.845
FUN SITTING OUT FOR DROUGHT-

01:21:23.912 --> 01:21:24.813
FOR THE LAST FIVE MONTHS WE

01:21:24.879 --> 01:21:26.114
HAVE NOT GOT ANY OF OUR FUNDS

01:21:26.181 --> 01:21:27.616
SO THESE PROGRAMS ARE GREAT.

01:21:27.682 --> 01:21:29.684
BUT I REALLY STRIVED ACT- THE

01:21:29.751 --> 01:21:31.987
STATE AND CDFA PUSH- THAT

01:21:32.053 --> 01:21:33.755
THEY'RE EASIER FOR FARMERS. AND

01:21:33.822 --> 01:21:35.590
I'M NOT THERE YOU KNOW EASIER

01:21:35.657 --> 01:21:38.460
FOR US TO GET OUR FUNDS- I

01:21:38.526 --> 01:21:40.095
CALLED ACTION. FOR THE

01:21:40.161 --> 01:21:41.463
COMMUNITY TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE

01:21:41.529 --> 01:21:42.697
CAN TAKE MOST OF THIS

01:21:42.764 --> 01:21:44.266
REGIONALLY. I TALK ABOUT-

01:21:44.332 --> 01:21:49.437
RECLAIM. WASTEWATER SYSTEM WE

01:21:49.504 --> 01:21:50.071
USE FOR THIRTY YEARS HOW CAN WE

01:21:50.138 --> 01:21:51.306
BY HOW CAN WE YOU DON'T OUR FOR

01:21:51.373 --> 01:21:53.541
OUR FARMLAND GIVEN THAT WAS CUT

01:21:53.608 --> 01:21:55.477
IN HALF BUT- URBAN AND THE

01:21:55.543 --> 01:21:56.878
GEYSERS WERE HALF OF THAT WATER

01:21:56.945 --> 01:21:58.913
GOES FOR ELECTRICITY WAS NOT

01:21:58.980 --> 01:22:00.448
CUT. BUT WHAT WE DO ON OUR

01:22:00.515 --> 01:22:01.983
FARMERS WE RECHARGE THE GROUND

01:22:02.050 --> 01:22:03.118
BY UTILIZING THAT WATER

01:22:03.184 --> 01:22:04.919
IRRIGATION. AND THAT LESSENS

01:22:04.986 --> 01:22:06.321
THE AMOUNT OF WATER WE PULL OUT

01:22:06.388 --> 01:22:07.822
OF THE GROUND. WE HAVE NOT YOUR

01:22:07.889 --> 01:22:09.624
GATED FROM AWHILE IN OVER

01:22:09.691 --> 01:22:11.159
THIRTY YEARS SO I REALLY STRIVE

01:22:11.226 --> 01:22:12.560
TO. WORK REGIONALLY WITH SOME

01:22:12.627 --> 01:22:13.728
OF OUR CLAIM WASTE WATER

01:22:13.795 --> 01:22:15.530
SYSTEMS. AND REALLY LOOK AT IS

01:22:15.597 --> 01:22:17.132
THIS WATER SUSTAINABLE GOING TO

01:22:17.198 --> 01:22:19.267
URBAN OR GOING UP FOR HYDRO

01:22:19.334 --> 01:22:21.403
ELECTRICITY- HOW CAN ME

01:22:21.469 --> 01:22:22.604
REVAMPED SOME OF OUR WATER

01:22:22.671 --> 01:22:25.140
QUALITY. I'M RULES ON THE JERRY

01:22:25.206 --> 01:22:27.709
SIDE- FOR YEARS IT WAS. YOU

01:22:27.776 --> 01:22:28.943
KNOW SEND CLEAN WATER OFF THE

01:22:29.010 --> 01:22:31.012
FARM- BUT HOW CAN WE CAPTURE

01:22:31.079 --> 01:22:33.214
THAT RAIN WATER INTO. INTO OUR

01:22:33.281 --> 01:22:35.550
DAMS. INTO SOMETHING- HOLDING

01:22:35.617 --> 01:22:37.152
FACILITIES SO WE COULD UTILIZE

01:22:37.218 --> 01:22:38.153
THAT BACK TOGETHER WASHER

01:22:38.219 --> 01:22:40.822
CORRALS. OR WATER ANIMALS. AND

01:22:40.889 --> 01:22:42.457
ALSO YOU KNOW TAKING DOWN SOME

01:22:42.524 --> 01:22:43.491
OF THE RED TAPE WHEN WE THINK

01:22:43.558 --> 01:22:45.427
ABOUT. CAN WE CLEAN OUT SOME OF

01:22:45.493 --> 01:22:46.728
OUR DAMS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE

01:22:46.795 --> 01:22:48.897

01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:29.443
ACT OF THE Y. RIGHT IN THE

01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:32.046
DIRECTION OF OUR AQUIFERS AS AN

01:32:32.113 --> 01:32:34.749
INDICATOR. AS AN INDICATOR OF

01:32:34.815 --> 01:32:36.717
THAT. OTHER PEOPLE ARE NOTICING

01:32:36.784 --> 01:32:41.555
THIS WE'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THERE

01:32:41.622 --> 01:32:43.858
IS A CRIED BUT- THERE'S A

01:32:43.925 --> 01:32:46.060
PROVIDE A PRIVATE PROPOSAL IN

01:32:46.127 --> 01:32:47.528
FRONT OF A LOCAL GOVERNING

01:32:47.595 --> 01:32:50.932
WATER BOARD. TO PROVIDE WATER

01:32:50.998 --> 01:32:53.668
TO HUNDREDS OF ACRES OF

01:32:53.734 --> 01:32:56.837
CURRENTLY I NEAR GATED LAND THE

01:32:56.904 --> 01:32:58.205
TO THAT WILL BE DEVELOPED

01:32:58.272 --> 01:32:59.607
THROUGH A PIPELINE FROM AN

01:32:59.674 --> 01:33:01.842
EXISTING SOURCE THAT WILL THEN

01:33:01.909 --> 01:33:04.745
BE DEVELOPED FOR THE FURTHER.

01:33:04.812 --> 01:33:07.848
ON PLANTING OF OLIVES AND

01:33:07.915 --> 01:33:10.151
GRAPES IN OUR AREA NOW WE ALL I

01:33:10.217 --> 01:33:13.454
THINK WE ALL CAN UNDERSTAND THE

01:33:13.521 --> 01:33:16.223
ARM REST WITH WHICH WE BELIEVE

01:33:16.290 --> 01:33:17.558
THAT THIS IS NOT GOING TO HAVE

01:33:17.625 --> 01:33:19.260
AN IMPACT ON OUR- GROUNDWATER

01:33:19.327 --> 01:33:21.429
SYSTEM WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH.

01:33:21.495 --> 01:33:23.831
SOUTHERN SAN WALKING EVEN IN

01:33:23.898 --> 01:33:29.437
OTHER AREAS. SO THIS WHAT WHAT

01:33:29.503 --> 01:33:30.571
WE SEE HERE ARE HAPPENING

01:33:30.638 --> 01:33:32.873
AROUND US IS KIND OF REALLY

01:33:32.940 --> 01:33:35.977
SIMILAR TO OUR MANY POINTS IN

01:33:36.043 --> 01:33:37.445
CALIFORNIA HISTORY WERE SMALL

01:33:37.511 --> 01:33:40.881
FARMS SMALL FAMILY FARMS HOUSE

THEIR SURVIVAL HAS BEEN

01:33:42.216 --> 01:33:44.385
DEPENDENT ON FACTORS IN POWERS

01:33:44.452 --> 01:33:46.187
MUCH LARGER THAN THEY THEN

01:33:46.253 --> 01:33:50.458
THERE'S- AND THIS SEEMS LIKE TO

01:33:50.524 --> 01:33:51.926
BE PARTICULARLY TRUE AT THIS

01:33:51.993 --> 01:33:55.029
TIME THE POWER ON BOTH SIDES OF

01:33:55.096 --> 01:33:57.365
THE FENCE IS ON THE FENCE IS

01:33:57.431 --> 01:33:59.333
BEYOND ALMOST BEYOND OUR

01:33:59.400 --> 01:33:59.967
ABILITY TO COMPREHEND THE SMALL

01:34:00.034 --> 01:34:03.404
FARMERS. BUT WHAT THAT'S WHY WE

01:34:03.471 --> 01:34:06.140

OTHER GROWERS ON THE WEST SIDE

01:36:24.211 --> 01:36:25.446
OF THE VALLEY WERE WERE LIMITED

TO GROWING YOU KNOW COTTON-

KNOW REALLY ALLOW US TO GROW

01:36:41.662 --> 01:36:44.532
THESE HIGH VALUE CROPS- THAT-

01:36:44.598 --> 01:36:46.033
THAT REALLY SUPPORT YOUR NUMBER

01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:47.902
OF JOBS AND SUPPORT A LOT OF

01:36:47.968 --> 01:36:50.471
SMALL COMMUNITIES AS WELL. WELL

FORMING THE CERTIFIED B. CORP

01:36:52.173 --> 01:36:53.274
LIKE TO TALK A BIT ABOUT THE

01:36:53.340 --> 01:36:54.441
SUSTAINABILITY PORTION OF

01:36:54.508 --> 01:36:56.977
THINGS- YEAH WE'RE CERTIFIED B.

01:36:57.044 --> 01:36:58.345
CORP MEANING THAT WE MEASURE

BASED ON SUSTAINABILITY AND YOU

01:37:02.016 --> 01:37:03.350
KNOW. MAKING SURE THEY WERE

01:37:03.417 --> 01:37:04.318
MAKING OUR DECISIONS THAT ARE

01:37:04.385 --> 01:37:05.819
BASED ON FACTORS LIKE THE

01:37:05.886 --> 01:37:07.955
COMMUNITY- FACT LIKE OUR WATER

01:37:08.022 --> 01:37:10.357
USE FACTORS LIKE OUR WASTE-

01:37:10.424 --> 01:37:11.392
FACTORS LIKE OUR EMISSIONS AND

01:37:11.458 --> 01:37:12.927
THINGS LIKE THAT- WE WORK

01:37:12.993 --> 01:37:15.262
REALLY HARD TO- TO MAKE SURE

01:37:15.329 --> 01:37:15.863
THE WORTH OF VISIONS POSSIBLE

01:37:15.930 --> 01:37:17.765
WITH THOSE. ARE TALKING A BIT

01:37:17.831 --> 01:37:19.066
ABOUT THIS YEAR'S CONDITIONS

01:37:19.133 --> 01:37:21.035
OUT WE STARTED OUT WITH A WITH

01:37:21.101 --> 01:37:22.836
WHAT WAS A 5% WATER ALLOCATION

01:37:22.903 --> 01:37:26.173
OF SURFACE WATER- YOU WHICH

01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:27.541
WASN'T HURT MUCH WHEN YOU'RE

01:37:27.608 --> 01:37:29.043
ONLY WHEN YOU'RE ONLY ALLOWED

01:37:29.109 --> 01:37:29.910
ABOUT TWO AND A HALF FEET OF

01:37:29.977 --> 01:37:38.085
WATER- FROM ITS SURFACE WATER.

01:37:38.152 --> 01:37:38.719
DELIVERIES- BUT THEN THAT WOULD

01:37:38.786 --> 01:37:40.888
I THOUGHT ZERO. AND YOUR MOM AT

01:37:40.955 --> 01:37:42.523
THAT CREATES A LOT OF PROBLEMS

01:37:42.590 --> 01:37:43.257
ZERO WATER MEANS WE HAVE TO

01:37:43.324 --> 01:37:44.325
RELY ON OUR ARMED YOUR STAVING

01:37:44.391 --> 01:37:47.461
ACCOUNT AS LECTURER FOR TO OUR

01:37:47.528 --> 01:37:48.929
TO OUR AQUIFER'S I REFER TO AS

01:37:48.996 --> 01:37:50.931
A SAVINGS ACCOUNT BECAUSE-

01:37:50.998 --> 01:37:51.999
REALLY YOU KNOW THE SURFACE

01:37:52.066 --> 01:37:53.634
WATER LIKE A CHECKING ACCOUNT

01:37:53.701 --> 01:37:54.435
LIKE REVENUE THAT'S COMING IN

01:37:54.501 --> 01:37:57.004
EVERY MONTH- AND THEN SOMETIMES

01:37:57.071 --> 01:37:58.339
WHEN THAT WHEN THAT FALL SHORT

01:37:58.405 --> 01:37:59.006
YOU HAVE TO TURN TO YOUR TO

01:37:59.073 --> 01:38:01.542
YOUR SAVINGS ACCOUNTS- BUT WITH

01:38:01.609 --> 01:38:02.776
CIGNA COMING AND THAT THAT'S

01:38:02.843 --> 01:38:04.378
THAT'S GOING TO BE- A HUGE

01:38:04.445 --> 01:38:06.513
CHALLENGE FOR US OTHERS CAN BE

01:38:06.580 --> 01:38:07.114
A LOT LESS THAN THAT SAVINGS

01:38:07.181 --> 01:38:09.483
ACCOUNT AS WELL- WE FOUND OUT

01:38:09.550 --> 01:38:11.986
WE WERE GETTING ZERO WATER- THE

01:38:12.052 --> 01:38:13.320
OBVIOUSLY LOOKED AT TO TRY TO

01:38:13.387 --> 01:38:15.289
GET MORE. YOU KNOW WATER

01:38:15.356 --> 01:38:18.192
TRANSFERS- TO COME IN- YOUNG

01:38:18.259 --> 01:38:19.760
AND SEEING IF ANYBODY OUTSIDE

01:38:19.827 --> 01:38:21.195
OUR WATER DISTRICT MIGHT HAVE

01:38:21.262 --> 01:38:23.697
WANTED TO WE COULD BRING IN-

01:38:23.764 --> 01:38:24.965
BUT THERE WAS NO FLEXIBILITY

01:38:25.032 --> 01:38:26.567
THERE THERE'S VERY LITTLE YOU

01:38:26.634 --> 01:38:29.536
KNOW WATER- LIQUIDITY- SO TO

01:38:29.603 --> 01:38:30.971
SPEAK- THAN THAT WITHIN THE

01:38:31.038 --> 01:38:33.140
MARKET. AND THAT WILL WATER

01:38:33.207 --> 01:38:34.975
THERE WAS- IT'S JUST SELLING

01:38:35.042 --> 01:38:36.443
FOR UNSUSTAINABLE RATES YOU

01:38:36.510 --> 01:38:38.112
CAN'T GROW CROP ON ON TWO

01:38:38.178 --> 01:38:39.480
THOUSAND DOLLAR WATER IT'S JUST

01:38:39.546 --> 01:38:42.583
ON FEASIBLE- IN THE END THERE

01:38:42.650 --> 01:38:45.219
WAS NO LIKE I SAID NO NO REALLY

01:38:45.286 --> 01:38:47.021
ABILITY WITHIN THE STATE SYSTEM

01:38:47.087 --> 01:38:48.689
AS WELL TO- TO BRING IN OTHER

01:38:48.756 --> 01:38:50.190
WATER EVEN WITH THE DROUGHT

01:38:50.257 --> 01:38:52.893
DECLARATION IN MAY- WHICH

01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:54.595
BASICALLY WHICH WHICH LEADS

01:38:54.662 --> 01:38:57.064
WHICH LED US TO- TO THE FACT OF

01:38:57.131 --> 01:38:58.499
HAVING TO PULL OUT ABOUT FOUR

01:38:58.565 --> 01:38:59.867
HUNDRED ACRES OF ALMONDS. WE

01:38:59.933 --> 01:39:02.536
MADE THAT DECISION- BACK IN

01:39:02.603 --> 01:39:04.772
APRIL AND WE HAD TO MAKE THAT

01:39:04.838 --> 01:39:06.774
DECISION AND IT WASN'T AS WE

01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:09.076
MADE EARLY ON- BUT WE KNEW IF

01:39:09.143 --> 01:39:10.444
WE HAD TO TRY TO- IF THOSE

01:39:10.511 --> 01:39:12.713
TREES THIS YEAR- WE WOULDN'T

01:39:12.780 --> 01:39:13.981
HAVE ENOUGH WATER TO IRRIGATE

01:39:14.048 --> 01:39:15.215
THE REST OF OUR TREES IN THE

01:39:15.282 --> 01:39:16.917
REST OF OUR OUR CROPS ARE

01:39:16.984 --> 01:39:18.652
TOMATOES IN OUR COLUMN. I

01:39:18.719 --> 01:39:20.921
THINGS LIKE THAT- WE JUST

01:39:20.988 --> 01:39:21.522
WOULDN'T HAVE ENOUGH WATER TO

01:39:21.588 --> 01:39:23.857
BE ABLE TO DO THAT- WHAT WE

01:39:23.924 --> 01:39:25.059
PULLED OUR FIFTEEN YEAR OLD

01:39:25.125 --> 01:39:27.227
TREES- AND I'M SURE AS IF

01:39:27.294 --> 01:39:29.163
ANYBODY'S FAMILIAR WITH THAT-

01:39:29.229 --> 01:39:30.631
ALMONDS GO FOR ABOUT TWENTY

01:39:30.698 --> 01:39:31.832
FIVE YEARS WHICH MEANS WE GIVE

01:39:31.899 --> 01:39:34.068
UP- YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE

01:39:34.134 --> 01:39:35.869
PEOPLE DUCTION IN THESE TREES.

01:39:35.936 --> 01:39:41.942
ARE. KNOWN FUTURE REVENUE BOB

01:39:42.009 --> 01:39:43.277
THE THEY'RE JUST WASN'T WATER

01:39:43.344 --> 01:39:44.912
AND IT WHICH IS BETTER WITH THE

01:39:44.978 --> 01:39:46.313
REST OF OPEN I TO LEAVE HIS

01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:48.682
THINGS IN THE YOU KNOW AS FAR

01:39:48.749 --> 01:39:50.217
AS MAKING THE FOR NOW YOU KNOW

01:39:50.284 --> 01:39:52.319
WE'RE LOOKING AT NEXT YEAR IS

01:39:52.386 --> 01:39:54.922
BEING ANOTHER 0% YEAR- WERE

01:39:54.988 --> 01:39:56.457
WERE MAKING YOU KNOW MAKING OUR

01:39:56.523 --> 01:39:57.991
ASSUMPTIONS ON HOW MUCH WE CAN

01:39:58.058 --> 01:40:00.527
PLANTS- FACTORING INTO WE HAVE

01:40:00.594 --> 01:40:02.396
NO WATER- NO SURFACE WATER

01:40:02.463 --> 01:40:04.598
COMING IN. AND WERE YOU KNOW

01:40:04.665 --> 01:40:05.199
LOOKING AT IT FROM THE

01:40:05.265 --> 01:40:07.368
STANDPOINT THAT SIGMOD NEW

01:40:07.434 --> 01:40:08.001
IMPLEMENTATION STARTS NEXT YEAR

01:40:08.068 --> 01:40:09.803
FOR US AS WELL. ASSORTMENT

01:40:09.870 --> 01:40:10.371
HAVEN'T MAKE A LOT OF HARD

01:40:10.437 --> 01:40:12.206
DECISIONS IN TERMS OF WHAT

01:40:12.272 --> 01:40:13.741
CROSS WE CAN GROW AND HOW MUCH

01:40:13.807 --> 01:40:16.877
WE CAN GROW AS WELL- AND AGAIN

01:40:16.944 --> 01:40:18.746
THAT HAS A HUGE OF IMPACT ON ON

01:40:18.812 --> 01:40:20.781
JOBS- NOT ONLY ON OUR OWN. YOU

01:40:20.848 --> 01:40:22.516
KNOW ON THE FARM ITSELF BUT IN

01:40:22.583 --> 01:40:24.918
A IN THE PROCESSING OPERATIONS-

01:40:24.985 --> 01:40:26.186
THAT ARE ALL THAT YOU KNOW

01:40:26.253 --> 01:40:28.188
THAT. YOUR DOCTOR THE YOU KNOW

01:40:28.255 --> 01:40:30.457
THE FORMED THIS WELL- ANYTIME

01:40:30.524 --> 01:40:31.492
THAT CROPS ARE ABLE TO BE

01:40:31.558 --> 01:40:33.260
GROUND. THERE'S DOWNSTREAM

01:40:33.327 --> 01:40:36.196
IMPACTS- THERE WAS NO ANSWER

01:40:36.263 --> 01:40:37.331
AND IT WILL LOOK TO THE FUTURE

01:40:37.398 --> 01:40:38.632
OF NEXT YEAR AS WELL AS I DRIVE

01:40:38.699 --> 01:40:39.767
AROUND THE WEST SIDE I SEE A

01:40:39.833 --> 01:40:41.468
LOT OF TREES THAT- DIDN'T GET

01:40:41.535 --> 01:40:43.203
VERY MUCH WATER THIS YEAR. I

01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:45.339
DIDN'T GET SAID- DEFINITELY GET

01:40:45.406 --> 01:40:48.041
ENOUGH WATER AND I AM AN AWFUL

01:40:48.108 --> 01:40:49.076
LOT OF GROWERS- OR THINKING

01:40:49.143 --> 01:40:50.811
ABOUT EITHER GET FULL

01:40:50.878 --> 01:40:51.678
INDUSTRIES OUT THIS UPCOMING

01:40:51.745 --> 01:40:54.014
YEAR. OR IF THEY'RE- YOU KNOW

01:40:54.081 --> 01:40:55.916
JUST DEFICIT HERE GETTING INTO

01:40:55.983 --> 01:40:57.184
THE TO THE POINT TO JUST BARELY

01:40:57.251 --> 01:40:58.552
KEEP THE THING ALIVE BUT- BUT

01:40:58.619 --> 01:40:59.753
THERE'S GONNA BE A SIGNIFICANT

01:40:59.820 --> 01:41:01.488
IMPACT TO HOW MUCH YOU KNOW

01:41:01.555 --> 01:41:06.193
WHAT. THE HOME CROWD LOOKS LIKE

01:41:06.260 --> 01:41:07.928
THE YEAR AND EXTRA AS WELL I'M

01:41:07.995 --> 01:41:09.430
THINKING ABOUT THE SALUTE YEAH

01:41:09.496 --> 01:41:10.798
I WAS KIND OF HARDENED IT TO

01:41:10.864 --> 01:41:12.699
HERE I AM DURING THE FIRST

01:41:12.766 --> 01:41:13.667
PANEL OF THE YOU KNOW THE

01:41:13.734 --> 01:41:15.903
CONCEPT OF RECHARGE- RECHARGES

01:41:15.969 --> 01:41:17.971
IS A HUGE HUGE THING FOR ACROSS

01:41:18.038 --> 01:41:19.206
HERE IN THE IN THE SOUTHERN

01:41:19.273 --> 01:41:21.508
SILICON VALLEY- BECAUSE WHEN

01:41:21.575 --> 01:41:23.710
THAT WATER DOES COME. AYE WE IT

01:41:23.777 --> 01:41:25.112
COMES IN HUGE FLOCKS AND WE'VE

01:41:25.179 --> 01:41:26.547
GOT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE

01:41:26.613 --> 01:41:28.348
THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO

01:41:28.415 --> 01:41:30.184
PULL THE WATER OUT OF. RIVERS

01:41:30.250 --> 01:41:31.385
AND STREAMS IS THERE ANYONE IS

01:41:31.452 --> 01:41:32.920
THERE YOU KNOW TURNING AND

01:41:32.986 --> 01:41:34.922
GOING AND MONDAY'S HEAVY STORMS

01:41:34.988 --> 01:41:36.690
AND ABLE TO STORE THAT WATER-

01:41:36.757 --> 01:41:38.058
BELOW GROUND ESPECIALLY THROUGH

01:41:38.125 --> 01:41:40.160
THROUGH RECHARGE PROJECTS- AS

01:41:40.227 --> 01:41:40.694
WELL AS SOME OF THE WATER

01:41:40.761 --> 01:41:42.229
THROUGH THE- THROUGH YOU KNOW

01:41:42.296 --> 01:41:43.831
THROUGH THE DELTA AMPLE YOU

01:41:43.897 --> 01:41:45.432
KNOW POINT OUT THROUGH. THE

01:41:45.499 --> 01:41:47.201
CALIFORNIA AQUEDUCT AND OTHER

01:41:47.267 --> 01:41:49.470
ADVANCES WELL- IT'S REALLY

01:41:49.536 --> 01:41:51.038
IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO

01:41:51.104 --> 01:41:52.372
RECHARGE OF GROUNDWATER IN THE

01:41:52.439 --> 01:41:53.207
IN THE YEARS WE HAVE THAT COULD

01:41:53.273 --> 01:41:55.476
FLOW- THE OTHER PIECE WITH THE

01:41:55.542 --> 01:41:56.910
ABOVE GROUND STORAGE AS WELL I

01:41:56.977 --> 01:41:58.879
NEED THAT WE JUST NEED TO BE

01:41:58.946 --> 01:41:59.847
ABLE TO CAPTURE MORE MORE THAT

01:41:59.913 --> 01:42:02.449
WATER. WHEN IT'S AVAILABLE-

01:42:02.516 --> 01:42:04.151
YEAH I THINK WE TALKED A LOT

01:42:04.218 --> 01:42:06.320
ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE- YEAH WE

01:42:06.386 --> 01:42:07.688
TALK ABOUT THE WATER IS GOIN

01:42:07.754 --> 01:42:09.923
TO COME DOWN YEAH MORE AS RAIN-

01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:10.858
THAT MEANS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO

01:42:10.924 --> 01:42:12.292
HAVE MORE STORAGE TO BE ABLE TO

01:42:12.359 --> 01:42:13.260
CAPTURE THAT IT'S NOT GONNA

01:42:13.327 --> 01:42:15.062
FALL IT'S NOT GONNA MELT SNOW

01:42:15.128 --> 01:42:17.364
MELTS AS IT HAS IN THE PAST SO

01:42:17.431 --> 01:42:20.100
WE HAVE TO YOU. TAKE DIFFERENT

01:42:20.167 --> 01:42:20.734
SAID TAKE A DIFFERENT TACK TO

01:42:20.801 --> 01:42:23.570
ME OUT OF PREVIOUSLY I JUST I

01:42:23.637 --> 01:42:25.239
LIKE TO SEE A MORE COOPERATION

01:42:25.305 --> 01:42:26.306
BETWEEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:42:26.373 --> 01:42:28.408
STATE ARE USING SNOW SCIENCE

01:42:28.475 --> 01:42:31.879
BASED APPROACH AS WELL- YEAH. I

01:42:31.945 --> 01:42:34.047
WAS REALLY SAD TO SEE THE STATE

01:42:34.114 --> 01:42:35.182
YOU KNOW SUE THE FEDERAL

01:42:35.249 --> 01:42:37.050
GOVERNMENT- YOU KNOW WHAT THE

01:42:37.117 --> 01:42:40.020
BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS- WHEN THOSE

01:42:40.087 --> 01:42:41.555
OPINIONS OUR LEAD ARE TAKING

01:42:41.622 --> 01:42:42.556
MORE SCIENCE BASED APPROACH

01:42:42.623 --> 01:42:44.358
RATHER THAN A CALENDAR BASED

01:42:44.424 --> 01:42:47.494
APPROACH- TO LOOKING AT- YOU

01:42:47.561 --> 01:42:48.929
KNOW HOW MUCH WATER CAN BE

01:42:48.996 --> 01:42:49.563
MOVED THROUGH THE DELTA THROUGH

01:42:49.630 --> 01:42:52.466
THE PUMPS THERE- YOU KNOW WHEN

01:42:52.533 --> 01:42:53.800
I'M PERFORMING I MAKING

01:42:53.867 --> 01:42:56.403
DECISIONS ON. YOUR ASIAN I'M

01:42:56.470 --> 01:42:57.404
LOOKING AT YOU KNOW SOIL

01:42:57.471 --> 01:42:58.972
MOISTURE DATA I'M LOOKING AT MY

01:42:59.039 --> 01:43:00.474
TREES YEAH LOOK AT THE STRESS

01:43:00.541 --> 01:43:09.883
THERE- I'M LOOKING A WHOLE.

01:43:09.950 --> 01:43:10.450
HOST OF DIFFERENT FACTORS NO

01:43:10.517 --> 01:43:11.051
FUTURE WHETHER AND I'M TAKING

SHOULD MODERN THE TREES ITS YOU

01:43:15.689 --> 01:43:16.590
KNOW IT'S A DIFFERENT IT'S THAT

01:43:16.657 --> 01:43:17.558
MUCH MORE SCIENCE BASED

01:43:17.624 --> 01:43:19.326
APPROACH. I'M NOT SPREAD OUT

01:43:19.393 --> 01:43:21.628
THE SEEDS FROM- FROM THE FROM

UC MERCED AND ON THE WORK THAT

01:43:51.258 --> 01:43:52.993
I'M DOING FOR MY DISSERTATION

01:43:53.060 --> 01:43:54.428
IS TO DEVELOP A LANDER

01:43:54.494 --> 01:43:56.129
PURPOSING MODEL THAT

01:43:56.196 --> 01:43:57.531
INCORPORATES AGRICULTURAL

01:43:57.598 --> 01:43:59.132
COMMUNITY INPUT IN ORDER TO

01:43:59.199 --> 01:44:02.202
MINIMIZE- IMPACTS TO OUR

01:44:02.269 --> 01:44:02.869
COMMUNITIES AND SMALL SCALE

01:44:02.936 --> 01:44:05.138
GROWERS I'VE ALSO DEVELOPED A

01:44:05.205 --> 01:44:07.240
TRILINGUAL CHANNEL CALLED

01:44:07.307 --> 01:44:09.576
COUNTY WATER AG. AND IT'S FOR

01:44:09.643 --> 01:44:11.078
OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND

01:44:11.144 --> 01:44:12.913
GROWERS TO REALLY LEARN ABOUT

01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:14.915
POLICIES LIKE CIGNA AND IT

01:44:14.982 --> 01:44:15.849
REALLY HELPS EXPLAIN THE

01:44:15.916 --> 01:44:17.417
SCIENCE AND POLICY BEHIND

01:44:17.484 --> 01:44:19.386
CALIFORNIA WATER AND

01:44:19.453 --> 01:44:22.122
AGRICULTURE. SO TODAY I'D LIKE

01:44:22.189 --> 01:44:24.558
TO BEGIN WITH JUST A BRIEF

01:44:24.625 --> 01:44:27.394
REVIEW OF THE TWENTY TWELVE TO

01:44:27.461 --> 01:44:28.929
TWENTY SIXTEEN DROUGHT IMPACTS

01:44:28.996 --> 01:44:30.731
FOR SMALL SCALE FARMERS IN

01:44:30.797 --> 01:44:33.000
CALIFORNIA AND I'D LIKE TO GIVE

01:44:33.066 --> 01:44:34.835
CREDIT TO RUTH DAHLQUIST

01:44:34.901 --> 01:44:37.170
WILLARD WITH UC AGRICULTURE AND

01:44:37.237 --> 01:44:39.640
NATURAL RESOURCES. SO SHE

01:44:39.706 --> 01:44:41.942
CONDUCTED A SURVEY OF SIXTY

01:44:42.009 --> 01:44:43.543
EIGHT SOUTH EAST ASIAN FARMERS

01:44:43.610 --> 01:44:47.047
AND. FRESNO. AND SO SOME OF THE

01:44:47.114 --> 01:44:49.082
IMPACTS THAT WERE SEEN IN TERMS

01:44:49.149 --> 01:44:50.584
OF IMPACTS TO SMALL SCALE

01:44:50.651 --> 01:44:52.853
FARMERS WERE. SHALLOW WELLS

01:44:52.919 --> 01:44:56.490
GOING DRY- A LOT OF THE FARMERS

01:44:56.556 --> 01:44:59.359
AND FRESNO AREA APPROXIMATELY

01:44:59.426 --> 01:45:01.495
96% OF THOSE FARMERS THAT WERE.

01:45:01.561 --> 01:45:03.330
SURVEYED RELY ON GROUNDWATER

01:45:03.397 --> 01:45:06.133
ENTIRELY SUGGEST LARGE SCALE

01:45:06.199 --> 01:45:08.869
IMPACTS INCLUDE LOSS OF WELLS

01:45:08.935 --> 01:45:11.204
ESPECIALLY SHALLOW WELLS-

01:45:11.271 --> 01:45:13.140
SHALLOW WELLS CAN TO GO FIRST.

01:45:13.206 --> 01:45:16.877
AND SHALLOW WELLS ARE OFTEN-

01:45:16.943 --> 01:45:19.946
OWNED BY A SMALL PORTABLE FARMS

01:45:20.013 --> 01:45:21.715
THAT DON'T HAVE THE MONEY OR

01:45:21.782 --> 01:45:23.517
THE RESOURCES TO DIG DEEPER

01:45:23.583 --> 01:45:26.753
WELLS OTHER ON IMPACTS WERE

01:45:26.820 --> 01:45:28.889
REDUCED WATER AVAILABILITY TO

01:45:28.955 --> 01:45:30.991
EVERY KEEP CROPS AND HIGHER

01:45:31.058 --> 01:45:32.926
ENERGY COSTS FOR GROUNDWATER

01:45:32.993 --> 01:45:35.162
PUMPING OR JUST OTHER

01:45:35.228 --> 01:45:37.898
OPERATIONS ON THE FARM AND THIS

01:45:37.964 --> 01:45:40.467
IS ALSO THIS STUDY ALSO FOUND

01:45:40.534 --> 01:45:41.401
POTENTIAL MENTAL HEALTH

01:45:41.468 --> 01:45:43.904
CONSEQUENCES WITH HAVING TO

01:45:43.970 --> 01:45:47.441
DEAL WITH- SURFACE WATER OF

01:45:47.507 --> 01:45:49.376
REDUCTION AS WELL AS HAVING TO

01:45:49.443 --> 01:45:52.746
DEAL WITH- MEETING. THOSE

01:45:52.813 --> 01:45:54.281
RESTRICTIONS THAT ARE BEING SAT

01:45:54.347 --> 01:45:56.349
ON SOME OF OUR SMALL SCALE

01:45:56.416 --> 01:45:58.085
FARMERS IN TERMS OF WATER USE.

01:45:58.151 --> 01:45:59.653
AS WELL AS IMPACTS FOR FOOD

01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:01.021
SECURITY NOT ONLY FOR THE

01:46:01.088 --> 01:46:03.490
NATION AND THE STATE BUT FOR

01:46:03.557 --> 01:46:05.525
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES

01:46:05.592 --> 01:46:08.228
THROUGHOUT THE SAMPSON COUNTY

01:46:08.295 --> 01:46:11.031
TRANSICOLD SEE RECOMMENDATIONS-

01:46:11.098 --> 01:46:13.266
I'VE PERSONALLY HAD THE

01:46:13.333 --> 01:46:14.601
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH

01:46:14.668 --> 01:46:16.103
SEVERAL SMALL SCALE FARMERS

01:46:16.169 --> 01:46:18.171
THROUGHOUT MY- DOCTORAL

01:46:18.238 --> 01:46:20.340
RESEARCH HERE EASY MERCED. A

01:46:20.407 --> 01:46:21.808
LOT OF WHAT I HAVE BEEN SEEING

01:46:21.875 --> 01:46:23.977
HAS BEEN DEALING WITH

01:46:24.044 --> 01:46:26.246
INFORMATION EQUITY EQUITY AND

01:46:26.313 --> 01:46:28.915
ACCESSIBILITY- SO I HIGHLY

01:46:28.982 --> 01:46:32.018
RECOMMEND AND WOULD LOVE TO SEE

01:46:32.085 --> 01:46:34.087
MORE FUNDING FOR INFORMATION

01:46:34.154 --> 01:46:36.189
BEING DEVELOPED IN NON ENGLISH

ARE SMALL SCALE FARMERS THAT

01:47:24.671 --> 01:47:26.473
DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH CAN ALSO BE

01:47:26.540 --> 01:47:27.874
AWARE OF WHAT'S GOING ON AND BE

01:47:27.941 --> 01:47:29.743

OF FINDING- SOME OF THESE ARE

01:47:38.885 --> 01:47:41.354
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT DOCTOR

WRITTEN A POLICY BRIEF THAT

01:47:47.460 --> 01:47:50.697
WILL BE PBLISHED SOON- SO SOME

01:47:50.764 --> 01:47:53.366
OF THE FUNDING COULD BE FOR ONE

01:47:53.433 --> 01:47:55.969

THAT MAY BE COMPLICATED WITH

01:48:03.977 --> 01:48:06.279
SIGMA BUT- I THINK IT'S

01:48:06.346 --> 01:48:07.247
SOMETHING TO CONSIDER IN TERMS

01:48:07.314 --> 01:48:10.350
OF REALLY EXPANDING FUNDING TO

01:48:10.417 --> 01:48:13.119
INCLUDE SMALL SCALE FARMERS AND

01:48:13.186 --> 01:48:14.621
MAKE ADJUSTMENTS SO THAT THESE

01:48:14.688 --> 01:48:16.423
ARE TAILORED MORE TOWARD THAT

01:48:16.489 --> 01:48:20.227
SMALL FARMER ON ENVIRONMENT AND

01:48:20.293 --> 01:48:23.063

TECHNOLOGY WORK ON CONSERVATION

01:48:28.134 --> 01:48:30.537
TECHNOLOGY I'VE SPOKEN TO A LOT

01:48:30.604 --> 01:48:32.038
OF SMALL SCALE GROWERS THAT ARE

01:48:32.105 --> 01:48:35.242

TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS DRIP

01:48:36.543 --> 01:48:38.078
IRRIGATION BUT THEY JUST DON'T

01:48:38.144 --> 01:48:40.046
HAVE THE FINANCIAL MEANS TO DO

01:48:40.113 --> 01:48:41.948
SO AT THE MOMENT ESPECIALLY

01:48:42.015 --> 01:48:43.083
WHEN DEALING WITH DROUGHT AND

01:48:43.149 --> 01:48:45.552
WATER SHORTAGES AND HAVING TO

01:48:45.619 --> 01:48:47.721
TRANSITION TO OTHER

01:48:49.756 --> 01:48:52.058
NOT FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE FOR

TO EXTEND THIS FOR TECHNOLOGY

01:49:03.837 --> 01:49:05.272
THAT COULD HELP SAVE WATER DOWN

01:49:05.338 --> 01:49:07.073
THE LINE FOR OUR SMALL SCALE

01:49:07.140 --> 01:49:10.043

CONTRACT AND- FUNDS FUNDING I

01:50:12.672 --> 01:50:14.007
BELIEVE THAT'S ALL I HAVE FOR

01:50:14.074 --> 01:50:18.178

ACTUALLY GOT IS- ALLOCATION

01:50:40.500 --> 01:50:42.936
CERTAIN WATER ACT OF OFF. SHORE

01:50:43.003 --> 01:50:47.107
JANET LEIGH THIS. GROWER WAS

01:50:47.173 --> 01:50:48.875

TERMS OF PURCHASING WATER FROM

THEIR NEIGHBOR WHO HAS A LARGER

01:50:52.545 --> 01:50:54.948
PLOT OF LAND- SO THEY WERE

01:50:55.015 --> 01:50:56.883
FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO DO THAT

01:50:56.950 --> 01:50:59.085
THIS ISN'T THE CASE FOR EVERY

01:50:59.152 --> 01:51:01.221
SINGLE FARMER OUT THERE. A LOT

01:51:01.287 --> 01:51:03.923
OF SMALL SCALE GROWERS. AND

01:51:03.990 --> 01:51:05.492
THEY JUST MAY NOT HAVE THE

01:51:05.558 --> 01:51:06.960
MEANS OR THE CONNECTIONS TO

01:51:07.027 --> 01:51:08.228
OTHERS THAT MAY BE ABLE TO

01:51:08.294 --> 01:51:10.130
PROVIDE THEM WITH SURFACE WATER

01:51:10.196 --> 01:51:12.565
ALLOCATIONS THAT ARE SURPLUS

01:51:12.632 --> 01:51:15.435
FOR OTHER GROWERS THIS GROWER

01:51:15.502 --> 01:51:16.569
WAS INTERESTED IN CONVERTING

01:51:16.636 --> 01:51:18.371
WATER SINCE- CONVERTING THEIR

01:51:18.438 --> 01:51:19.906
WATER SYSTEM FROM SPRAY

01:51:19.973 --> 01:51:21.841
MEASURES TO DRIP IRRIGATION.

01:51:21.908 --> 01:51:23.443
BUT THEY CURRENTLY CANNOT

01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:26.346
AFFORD. THAT TRANSITION TO NEW

01:51:26.413 --> 01:51:28.882
TECHNOLOGY THERE'S A MIXED

01:51:28.948 --> 01:51:30.350
VEGGIE FARMER IN FRESNO AND

01:51:30.417 --> 01:51:32.886
CORRECTOR. AND WHO IS GROUND

01:51:32.952 --> 01:51:35.422
WATER RELIANT AND SO WHEN THEY

01:51:35.488 --> 01:51:36.489
WERE LOOKING TO EXPAND THEIR

01:51:36.556 --> 01:51:39.759
OPERATIONS THEY FOUND THAT-

01:51:39.826 --> 01:51:41.294
THERE WELL THE WELL OF THE LAND

01:51:41.361 --> 01:51:42.562
THAT THEY HAD JUST PURCHASED

01:51:42.629 --> 01:51:44.497
WHICH IS ABOUT TEN ACRES. WAS

01:51:44.564 --> 01:51:47.867
ABOUT TEN FEET ABOVE THE WATER

01:51:47.934 --> 01:51:49.302
TABLE SO THE PUMP WASN'T

01:51:49.369 --> 01:51:51.571
REACHING THE GROUND WATER THAT

01:51:51.638 --> 01:51:53.106
THEY NEEDED TO START THIS

01:51:53.173 --> 01:51:55.575
OPERATION- THEY HAD ALREADY

01:51:55.642 --> 01:51:57.577
SPENT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN

01:51:57.644 --> 01:51:59.079
PURCHASING LAND AS WELL AS

01:51:59.145 --> 01:52:00.914
OTHER COSTS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED

01:52:00.980 --> 01:52:04.617
WITH. YOU KNOW STARTING A SMALL

01:52:04.684 --> 01:52:07.120
SCALE FARM AND THEY WERE ALSO

01:52:07.187 --> 01:52:09.355
INTERESTED IN PURCHASING-

01:52:09.422 --> 01:52:10.723
EFFICIENT IRRIGATION SO THAT

01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:13.626
THEY CAN START. THEIR

01:52:13.693 --> 01:52:15.929
OPERATIONS EFFICIENTLY AND

01:52:15.995 --> 01:52:16.963
CONSERVING WATER AS MUCH AS

01:52:17.030 --> 01:52:19.666
POSSIBLE BUT THE FUNDS JUST

01:52:19.732 --> 01:52:21.101
AREN'T PAYING OR THE MEANS FOR

01:52:21.167 --> 01:52:22.402
THEM TO FINANCIALLY AFFORD

01:52:22.469 --> 01:52:24.137
THESE TRANSITIONS. ARE

01:52:24.204 --> 01:52:26.539
IMPLEMENTATION OF TECHNOLOGY IS

01:52:26.606 --> 01:52:29.175
NOT THERE. ON THAT IS ALL I

01:52:29.242 --> 01:52:31.077
WILL SAY FOR NOW BUT I THINK

01:52:31.144 --> 01:52:33.580
FOUND. AS WE'RE FACED WITH THIS

01:52:33.646 --> 01:52:36.316
DROUGHT AND- EVEN WITH THE

01:52:36.382 --> 01:52:38.251
GROUNDWATER OVERDRAFT ISSUE

01:52:38.318 --> 01:52:40.086
NETWORK BASED IN THE STATE.

01:52:40.153 --> 01:52:43.289
THERE IS A LOT- OF- NEED TO BE

01:52:43.356 --> 01:52:44.858
THERE FOR SMALL SCALE FARMERS

01:52:44.924 --> 01:52:47.127
IN TERMS OF MAKING INFORMATION

01:52:47.193 --> 01:52:49.062
ACCESSIBLE TO THEM IN MULTIPLE

01:52:49.129 --> 01:52:51.097
LANGUAGES SO THAT EVERYONE CAN

01:52:51.164 --> 01:52:52.899
MOVE FORWARD TOGETHER. AND

01:52:52.966 --> 01:52:54.934
ADDRESSES GROUNDWATER OVERDRAFT

01:52:55.001 --> 01:52:57.003
AND WATER MANAGEMENT TOGETHER.

01:52:57.070 --> 01:52:58.438
I THINK THAT MOVING FORWARD IN

01:52:58.505 --> 01:53:01.641
TERMS OF DROUGHT- IT WOULD BE

01:53:01.708 --> 01:53:05.345
BENEFICIALTO SPEAK WITH-

01:53:05.411 --> 01:53:06.546
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE WORKING

01:53:06.613 --> 01:53:08.214
DIRECTLY WITH OUR FARMERS WITH

01:53:08.281 --> 01:53:10.150
OUR SMALL SCALE GROWERS. SO

01:53:10.216 --> 01:53:11.618
THAT THE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE

01:53:11.684 --> 01:53:13.953
BEING DEVELOPED. REFLECT THE

01:53:14.020 --> 01:53:16.022
NEEDS OF OUR GROWERS SO THAT WE

01:53:16.089 --> 01:53:18.791
CAN ADDRESS WATER MANAGEMENT

01:53:18.858 --> 01:53:20.460
AND MINDLESS MANAGEMENT IN THE

01:53:20.527 --> 01:53:22.462
ONE THAT. DOESN'T NEGATIVELY

01:53:22.529 --> 01:53:24.898
IMPACT THEM BUT EFFECTIVELY

01:53:24.964 --> 01:53:28.902
ADDRESSES. THEIR NEEDS FOR THE

01:53:28.968 --> 01:53:31.471
FUTURE THANK YOU END AND THEY

01:53:31.538 --> 01:53:32.839

GROW AND FLOURISH BUT- IT'S

01:53:51.824 --> 01:53:53.493
REALLY TAKEN AWAY FROM THE

01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:55.528
ABILITY TO GET FOUR MORE WATER.

01:53:55.595 --> 01:53:56.663

THAT THAT EVERYONE IS FACING. I

01:56:43.496 --> 01:56:44.230
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE

RECOGNIZE THOSE THAT ARE DOING-

01:56:48.368 --> 01:56:49.068

THAT- OFTEN IN THIS BUILDING WE

01:56:54.807 --> 01:56:56.542
DO A LOT OF ONE SIZE FITS ALL

01:56:56.609 --> 01:56:58.644
LEGISLATION THAT DOESN'T

01:56:58.711 --> 01:57:00.747

DISTRICT- THE NORTH COAST WE

01:57:07.186 --> 01:57:08.855
DON'T HAVE A LOT OF THESE

01:57:08.921 --> 01:57:11.958
MASSIVE FARMS REALLY DOWN- WE

01:57:12.024 --> 01:57:13.292
HAVE A LOT OF SMALL FARMERS IT

01:57:13.359 --> 01:57:15.128
IS IT IS IT IS A FEELING MOSTLY

01:57:15.194 --> 01:57:17.029
SMALL FARMERS AS A BIGGER

01:57:17.096 --> 01:57:19.232
ENTITIES OF GROWING GRAPES BY

01:57:19.298 --> 01:57:20.199
THE FURTHER NORTH YOU GO THE

01:57:20.266 --> 01:57:22.969
LESS YOU SEE OF THAT. AND JUST

01:57:23.035 --> 01:57:24.370
YOU KNOW THINKING WE ALSO RELY

ST LOUIS AND ULTIMATE ON A

02:01:38.424 --> 02:01:40.960

02:01:57.410 --> 02:01:59.445
BEEN- INTERESTED IN WORKING

02:01:59.512 --> 02:02:01.347
WITH A DIFFERENT SECTORS AND-

02:02:01.414 --> 02:02:02.848
WANTED TO START JUST JUST VERY

02:02:02.915 --> 02:02:04.950
QUICKLY WITH A QUICK STORY-

02:02:05.017 --> 02:02:06.252
BECAUSE IT'S- L. ILLUSTRATIVE

02:02:06.318 --> 02:02:09.188
IN MY MIND- I'VE BEEN ON THE-

02:02:09.255 --> 02:02:10.656
TWITTER AND I POSTED A MAP THE

02:02:10.723 --> 02:02:11.791
OTHER DAY AND WE DO A LOT OF

02:02:11.857 --> 02:02:16.228
MAPS. HERE ON THE FARM AND WE

02:02:16.295 --> 02:02:17.363
USE SPATIAL DATA SO I OF MY BIG

02:02:17.430 --> 02:02:18.230
FAN OF MAPS TELL STORIES IN AND

02:02:18.297 --> 02:02:19.665
LOOK AT THINGS AND OPPOSED A

02:02:19.732 --> 02:02:21.167
MAP OF THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER

02:02:21.233 --> 02:02:22.802
RESOURCES DIVISION OF FLOOD

02:02:22.868 --> 02:02:24.403
MANAGEMENT DOES A SACRAMENTO

02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:26.105
SAN JOAQUIN RIVER SYSTEMS-

02:02:26.172 --> 02:02:28.474
SCHEMATIC. AND IT ENDS UP

02:02:28.541 --> 02:02:29.241
LOOKING A LITTLE BIT LIKE A

02:02:29.308 --> 02:02:31.577
SUBWAY SYSTEM- IT SHOWS ALL THE

02:02:31.644 --> 02:02:33.312
DIFFERENT- BOXES FOR THE

02:02:33.379 --> 02:02:34.380
DIFFERENT RESERVOIRS AND THEIR

02:02:34.447 --> 02:02:37.316
CAPACITIES AND THEN- JUST- THE

02:02:37.383 --> 02:02:38.784
LIVE RIVERS END UP LOOKING LIKE

02:02:38.851 --> 02:02:41.520
A TRANSIT LINES- AND SO THE-

02:02:41.587 --> 02:02:43.456
REACTIONS WERE. A LOT OF PEOPLE

02:02:43.522 --> 02:02:45.257
WERE INTERESTED IN AND- I

02:02:45.324 --> 02:02:46.792
THOUGHT IT WAS- YOU KNOW. ABOUT

02:02:46.859 --> 02:02:49.161
MAYBE SOME HADN'T SEEN. AND I

02:02:49.228 --> 02:02:51.163
DID SEE ONE- AND NGO THE-

02:02:51.230 --> 02:02:52.398
FRIEND THAT I KNOW THAT POSTED

02:02:52.465 --> 02:02:54.767
YOU KNOW. HERE'S A LOOK AT- YOU

02:02:54.834 --> 02:02:55.434
KNOW KIND OF THE OVER

02:02:55.501 --> 02:02:58.604
ENGINEERING AND THE TERRIBLE

02:02:58.671 --> 02:03:00.172
THE OVER THE YEARS YOU KNOW TO

02:03:00.239 --> 02:03:02.007
THE RIVER SYSTEMS. AND I JUST

02:03:02.074 --> 02:03:03.209
THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PLACE

02:03:03.275 --> 02:03:04.443
FOR ME ONE WHEN WE'RE THINKING

02:03:04.510 --> 02:03:05.978
ABOUT SOLUTIONS AND THINKING

02:03:06.045 --> 02:03:06.946
ABOUT WHERE TO START I THINK WE

02:03:07.012 --> 02:03:08.881
DO NEED TO. KIND OF BE ABLE TO

02:03:08.948 --> 02:03:10.349
HAVE TOUGH CONVERSATIONS AND BE

02:03:10.416 --> 02:03:12.685
ABLE TO LOOK AT- AT SITUATIONS

02:03:12.752 --> 02:03:16.355
IN AN OBJECTIVE. OBJECTIVE WAY-

02:03:16.422 --> 02:03:17.957
YOU KNOW I THINK ALL OF US CAN

02:03:18.023 --> 02:03:19.191
REACH FOR THE TAPPER OR THE

02:03:19.258 --> 02:03:20.860
VAST MAJORITY CALIFORNIANS CAN

02:03:20.926 --> 02:03:21.827
REACH FOR THE TOP MATTER WHERE

02:03:21.894 --> 02:03:23.829
THEY ARE. IN THE- KIND OF

02:03:23.896 --> 02:03:25.698
UNDERSTAND THAT- YOU KNOW.

02:03:25.765 --> 02:03:26.866
WHAT'S GOING TO COME OUT AND

02:03:26.932 --> 02:03:28.734
THEY RELY ON THAT AND- YOU KNOW

02:03:28.801 --> 02:03:30.436
THEY THEY TRUST THAT AND- YOU

02:03:30.503 --> 02:03:32.505
KNOW THAT. IN A LOT OF A- LOT

02:03:32.571 --> 02:03:33.873
OF PLACES- OBVIOUSLY THE

02:03:33.939 --> 02:03:35.141
MARKETS ARE ALSO FULL OF FOOD

02:03:35.207 --> 02:03:36.442
AND SO WE DON'T WE DON'T WORRY

02:03:36.509 --> 02:03:37.743
ABOUT ABOUT THOSE KIND OF

02:03:37.810 --> 02:03:39.378
THINGS AND I THINK ALSO. PEOPLE

02:03:39.445 --> 02:03:40.846
LIVE IN FLOOD PRONE AREAS AND

02:03:40.913 --> 02:03:41.680
WHEN IT'S RAINING THEY DON'T

02:03:41.747 --> 02:03:43.682
FEAR THE- FEAR THE FLOODS-

02:03:43.749 --> 02:03:45.217
ANYMORE AND THINK A LOT OF

02:03:45.284 --> 02:03:46.352
THAT'S BECAUSE WE DO HAVE AN

02:03:46.418 --> 02:03:48.721
ENGINEERED SYSTEM- AND I THINK.

02:03:48.788 --> 02:03:50.623
YOU KNOW. MAYBE WASN'T MAYBE

02:03:50.689 --> 02:03:51.757
SOME OF THE DECISIONS THAT WERE

02:03:51.824 --> 02:03:53.526
MADE. AND HOW THINGS WERE WERE

02:03:53.592 --> 02:03:55.995
PUT TOGETHER- YOU KNOW DIDN'T.

02:03:56.061 --> 02:03:57.763
ACCOUNT FOR. YOU KNOW

02:03:57.830 --> 02:03:59.498
EVERYTHING OR OR YOU KNW

02:03:59.565 --> 02:04:01.033
THERE'S- THERE'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN

02:04:01.100 --> 02:04:02.902
SOME ISSUES WITH HAVING A

02:04:02.968 --> 02:04:04.170
HIGHLY ENGINEERED SYSTEM BUT I

02:04:04.236 --> 02:04:05.271
THINK AT LEAST WE NEED TO START

02:04:05.337 --> 02:04:07.239
WITH. THE RECOGNITION THAT

02:04:07.306 --> 02:04:08.641
SYSTEM GIVES US THE CALIFORNIA

02:04:08.707 --> 02:04:11.243
THAT WE HAVE- YOU KNOW CANNOT

02:04:11.310 --> 02:04:15.247
BE MANAGED BETTER CAN. WE DO

02:04:15.314 --> 02:04:15.848
DIFFERENT THINGS YOU KNOW. WE

02:04:15.915 --> 02:04:16.415
OF THE CAN BUT I WE ALSO TO

02:04:16.482 --> 02:04:17.216
MAKE SURE THAT WE SOME

02:04:17.283 --> 02:04:18.484
INVESTMENTS THE SYSTEM AND I

02:04:18.551 --> 02:04:19.485
THINK THAT'S WHERE WHEN WE'RE

02:04:19.552 --> 02:04:21.320
TALKING ABOUT SOLUTIONS. THERE

02:04:21.387 --> 02:04:23.055
HAVE TO BE SOME INVESTMENTS

02:04:23.122 --> 02:04:25.057
AND- TO BE HONEST I JUST FEEL

02:04:25.124 --> 02:04:26.959
LIKE WE REALLY LAGGED BEHIND-

02:04:27.026 --> 02:04:28.294
WE HAD POPULATION GROWTH AND

02:04:28.360 --> 02:04:29.829
WE'VE HAD YOU KNOW. MASSIVE

02:04:29.895 --> 02:04:31.497
CHANGE IN OUR STATE BUT NOT NOT

02:04:31.564 --> 02:04:33.098
MUCH IN THE WAY OF. CHANGING

02:04:33.165 --> 02:04:36.268
OUR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE- AND

02:04:36.335 --> 02:04:37.503
YOU KNOW I THINK CALIFORNIA'S

02:04:37.570 --> 02:04:38.704
VERY PROGRESSIVE STATE YOU KNOW

02:04:38.771 --> 02:04:40.606
WE LEAD ON- CLIMATE CHANGE WITH

02:04:40.673 --> 02:04:41.307
THE LEADERSHIP OF THE

02:04:41.373 --> 02:04:43.108
LEGISLATURE WE READ ON. YOU

02:04:43.175 --> 02:04:44.877
KNOW WANTING TO BE THE FRONT

02:04:44.944 --> 02:04:47.947
RUNNERS IN- IN INFRASTRUCTURE

02:04:48.013 --> 02:04:49.248
FOR. TRANSPORTATION FOR MODERN

02:04:49.315 --> 02:04:51.383
TRANSPORTATION- I DRIVE BACK

02:04:51.450 --> 02:04:52.751
AND FORTH FROM FRESNO TO LOS

02:04:52.818 --> 02:04:54.553
BANOS QUITE A BIT AND- SEE THE

02:04:54.620 --> 02:04:55.921
LARGEST CEMENT STRUCTURE GOING

02:04:55.988 --> 02:04:57.456
ON ACROSS THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER

02:04:57.523 --> 02:04:59.992
THERE TO. TO SUPPORT- YOU KNOW

02:05:00.059 --> 02:05:02.795
HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT- AND I

02:05:02.862 --> 02:05:03.829
THINK THAT'S GREAT YOU KNOW IF

02:05:03.896 --> 02:05:05.064
WE CAN WE CAN HAVE A PUBLIC

02:05:05.130 --> 02:05:06.799
THAT'S WILLING TO SAY WILL VOTE

02:05:06.866 --> 02:05:08.801
FOR. A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS-

02:05:08.868 --> 02:05:09.702
TO SUPPORT THAT KIND OF

02:05:09.768 --> 02:05:11.136
INFRASTRUCTURE AYE I THINK THE

02:05:11.203 --> 02:05:12.171
ONLY THING I HAVE A HARD TIME

02:05:12.238 --> 02:05:14.106
WITH THIS. WHEN WE HAVE YOU

02:05:14.173 --> 02:05:15.841
KNOW A FOUR BILLION DOLLAR-

02:05:15.908 --> 02:05:17.576
WATER PROJECT THERE ARE YOU

02:05:17.643 --> 02:05:18.744
KNOW THEY'RE LOOKED AT AS BEING

02:05:18.811 --> 02:05:20.212
TOO EXPENSIVE. EVEN WHEN THEY

02:05:20.279 --> 02:05:21.680
DO HAVE. DIRECT AND

02:05:21.747 --> 02:05:24.483
DEMONSTRABLE BENEFITS FOR. THE

02:05:24.550 --> 02:05:26.285
ENVIRONMENT AND FOR COMMUNITIES

02:05:26.352 --> 02:05:28.687
AND FOR AGRICULTURE- YOU KNOW

02:05:28.754 --> 02:05:29.722
THEY'RE STILL JUST LIKE THAT IS

02:05:29.788 --> 02:05:31.490
THAT'S TOO MUCH BUT- YOU KNOW

02:05:31.557 --> 02:05:32.424
AGAIN. WE DO HAVE THE WILL

02:05:32.491 --> 02:05:34.560
POWER TO- PUT MONEY TOWARDS

02:05:34.627 --> 02:05:36.095
VERY LARGE PROJECTS AND I THINK

02:05:36.161 --> 02:05:37.529
YOU KNOW THE TIME HAS COME TO

02:05:37.596 --> 02:05:38.597
WHERE YOU. NEED TO PUT SOME OF

02:05:38.664 --> 02:05:40.733
THAT MONEY TOWARDS OUR- WATER

02:05:40.799 --> 02:05:44.136
INFRASTRUCTURE. BECAUSE- WE ARE

02:05:44.203 --> 02:05:44.703
LAGGING BEHIND WHEN I THINK

02:05:44.770 --> 02:05:45.504
WHILE EVERYTHING IS ON THE

02:05:45.571 --> 02:05:47.206
TABLE- YOU KNOW WE NEED

02:05:47.273 --> 02:05:49.508
GROUNDWATER RECHARGE. WE NEED-

02:05:49.575 --> 02:05:51.510
WATER MARKETS AND FLEXIBILITY

02:05:51.577 --> 02:05:53.913
AND ALL THOSE KIND OF THINGS.

02:05:53.979 --> 02:05:54.513
YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY THERE ARE

02:05:54.580 --> 02:05:56.548
GOING TO NEED. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:05:56.615 --> 02:05:57.650
EARLIER REFERENCED YOU KNOW THE

02:05:57.716 --> 02:05:58.517
NEED FOR SOME ADDITIONAL

02:05:58.584 --> 02:05:59.985
INFRASTRUCTURE NINE AND I FEEL

02:06:00.052 --> 02:06:00.819
LIKE THAT THAT'S TRUE THEIR

02:06:00.886 --> 02:06:02.621
SMALL STREAM. PROJECTS THAT

02:06:02.688 --> 02:06:03.989
NEED TO GET BUILT. THERE SOME

02:06:04.056 --> 02:06:05.991
CAN BAN SAID NEEDS- CAPACITY

02:06:06.058 --> 02:06:08.360
NEEDS TO BE RESTORED- YOU KNOW

02:06:08.427 --> 02:06:09.962
WE CAN'T HAVE AN ACTIVE WATER

02:06:10.029 --> 02:06:10.763
MARKET IF YOU CAN'T TRANSMIT

02:06:10.829 --> 02:06:13.332
THE PRODUCT. AND WE CAN'T GET-

02:06:13.399 --> 02:06:14.800
GROUNDWATER RECHARGE TO WORK

02:06:14.867 --> 02:06:16.402
EFFECTIVELY YOU CAN'T MOVE THE

02:06:16.468 --> 02:06:18.637
WATER INTO THE AREAS THAT ARE

02:06:18.704 --> 02:06:22.274
APPROPRIATE RECHARGE. AND THEN

02:06:22.341 --> 02:06:22.875
ALSO EXTRACT THAT WATER AT THE

02:06:22.942 --> 02:06:24.043
SAME TIME AND MOVE IT TO WHERE

02:06:24.109 --> 02:06:25.978
IT'S NEEDED AND IN TIMES OF

02:06:26.045 --> 02:06:28.847
SCARCITY. SO AGAIN I THINK WE

02:06:28.914 --> 02:06:30.549
NEED TO. WE NEED TO STEP BACK

02:06:30.616 --> 02:06:31.984
WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT THAT

02:06:32.051 --> 02:06:33.218
THE CALIFORNIA THAT WE DO HAVE

02:06:33.285 --> 02:06:35.421
TODAY- I THINK WE NEED TO VALUE

02:06:35.487 --> 02:06:36.755
ALL THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS

02:06:36.822 --> 02:06:38.457
I'M I'M A- I'M A CALIFORNIA

02:06:38.524 --> 02:06:40.993
FARMER BUT- I AM- FIRMLY EIGHT.

02:06:41.060 --> 02:06:42.962
A CALIFORNIANS FIRST AND

02:06:43.028 --> 02:06:44.897
BELIEVE THAT. I CALIFORNIA'S A

02:06:44.964 --> 02:06:45.898
WONDERFUL STATE THAT IT IS

02:06:45.965 --> 02:06:47.099
BECAUSE THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE

02:06:47.166 --> 02:06:49.134
HAVE BOTH- YOU KNOW LARGE AND

02:06:49.201 --> 02:06:51.070
SMALL AND IN BETWEEN. IT'S A

02:06:51.136 --> 02:06:52.237
WONDERFUL PLACE BECAUSE THE

02:06:52.304 --> 02:06:53.839
ENVIRONMENT THAT WE HAVE. AND

02:06:53.906 --> 02:06:55.040
IT'S A WONDERFUL PLACE BECAUSE

02:06:55.107 --> 02:06:57.209
OF HAVING AGRICULTURE THAT WE

02:06:57.276 --> 02:06:59.044
DO HAVE. AND HAVING AGRICULTURE

02:06:59.111 --> 02:07:00.012
THAT OPERATES IN A HIGHLY

02:07:00.079 --> 02:07:01.714
REGULATED ENVIRONMENT AND THAT

02:07:01.780 --> 02:07:03.082
DOES CARE FOR WORKERS AND

02:07:03.148 --> 02:07:04.750
WORKER PROTECTION AND- DOES

02:07:04.817 --> 02:07:05.784
CARE FOR ENVIRONMENT

02:07:05.851 --> 02:07:07.619
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION WITH-

02:07:07.686 --> 02:07:08.921
YOU KNOW ENFORCEABLE PENALTIES

02:07:08.988 --> 02:07:10.956
IF WE MAKE A- MAKE A MISTAKE.

02:07:11.023 --> 02:07:12.558
AND I ALSO THINK IT'S A

02:07:12.624 --> 02:07:16.028
MISTAKE- IN SOME WAYS I DO

02:07:16.095 --> 02:07:16.829
THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE

02:07:16.895 --> 02:07:18.464
AGRICULTURE CHANGE WITH CIGNA.

02:07:18.530 --> 02:07:20.265
AND I AND I DO AGREE THAT

02:07:20.332 --> 02:07:21.266
SIGNAL WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS

02:07:21.333 --> 02:07:22.735
NECESSARY. I THINK IT'S

02:07:22.801 --> 02:07:24.169
IMPORTANT TO BE HONEST AND IN

02:07:24.236 --> 02:07:25.170
THOSE DISCUSSIONS I THINK WE

02:07:25.237 --> 02:07:27.306
HEARD- WE'VE HEARD FROM A BUNCH

02:07:27.373 --> 02:07:29.742
OF FAMILY FARMERS TODAY- WE'VE

02:07:29.808 --> 02:07:32.111
HEARD SOME. ALLUSIONS TO OTHERS

02:07:32.177 --> 02:07:33.379
THAT HAVE COME IN AND MAKE YOU

02:07:33.445 --> 02:07:35.748
JUST SEE- CALIFORNIA AND

02:07:35.814 --> 02:07:37.816
CALIFORNIA FARMLAND AS AS AND

02:07:37.883 --> 02:07:39.251
NUMBER ON A SPREADSHEET

02:07:39.318 --> 02:07:40.919
SOMEWHERE WITH THE- RETURN

02:07:40.986 --> 02:07:43.222
PERCENTAGE ATTACHED TO IT AND-

02:07:43.288 --> 02:07:45.057

TO BABY RESTORE FISH

02:08:55.427 --> 02:08:56.795
POPULATIONS BETTER THAN JUST

02:08:56.862 --> 02:08:58.197
SUING EACH OTHER. MAYBE THE

02:08:58.263 --> 02:08:59.598

AND BY WORKING. TOGETHER WE GOT

02:09:01.633 --> 02:09:03.168
INTELLIGENT PEOPLE WE'VE GOT.

02:09:03.235 --> 02:09:04.736
MOTIVATED PEOPLE. AND THEY

02:09:04.803 --> 02:09:05.804
WOULD BE A LOT BETTER OFF

02:09:05.871 --> 02:09:08.240
PUTTING OUR ENERGY TOWARDS-

02:09:08.307 --> 02:09:09.741
MAKING SOME REAL PROGRESS IN

02:09:09.808 --> 02:09:11.310
TERMS OF DOING SOME PROJECTS

02:09:11.376 --> 02:09:12.311
TOGETHER VERSUS JUST FIGHTING

02:09:12.377 --> 02:09:14.546
EACH OTHER. AND JUST NOT THINK

02:09:14.613 --> 02:09:16.181
THAT WE JUST HAVE TO GIVE UP.

02:09:16.248 --> 02:09:17.416
YOU KNOW SO MUCH FARMLAND OR

02:09:17.483 --> 02:09:19.151
GIVE UP SO MUCH- YOU HAVE

02:09:19.218 --> 02:09:20.819
SPECIES TO GO EXTINCT I DON'T

02:09:20.886 --> 02:09:21.820
THINK THOSE ARE THE- KIND OF

02:09:21.887 --> 02:09:23.055
CONVERSATIONS I REALLY WANT TO

02:09:23.122 --> 02:09:24.857
BE. A PART OF YOU KNOW I DO

02:09:24.923 --> 02:09:25.924
LIKE I SAID EARLIER I THINK

02:09:25.991 --> 02:09:27.159
SIGNAL IS GOING TO TAKE CARE OF

02:09:27.226 --> 02:09:27.993
SOME OF THE UNSUSTAINABLE

02:09:28.060 --> 02:09:29.328
THINGS. THAT HAVE BEEN

02:09:29.394 --> 02:09:30.863
HAPPENING SO I'M FAIRLY

02:09:30.929 --> 02:09:34.199
CONFIDENT IN IN THERE'S GOING-TO BE SOME CHANGE THERE BUT- I

02:09:34.266 --> 02:09:35.367
THINK EVERY LOSS OF A

02:09:35.434 --> 02:09:37.236
CALIFORNIA FAMILY FARM. IS A

02:09:37.302 --> 02:09:39.571
HUGE LOSS FOR- NOT JUST

02:09:39.638 --> 02:09:41.573
CALIFORNIA BEFORE THE NATION- I

02:09:41.640 --> 02:09:42.608
THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND

02:09:42.674 --> 02:09:43.709
NOT JUST TALK ABOUT FOOD

02:09:43.775 --> 02:09:45.210
SECURITY BUT NUTRITION SECURITY

02:09:45.277 --> 02:09:47.312
BECAUSE THE KIND OF- THINGS WE

02:09:47.379 --> 02:09:48.514
PRODUCE HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHAT

02:09:48.580 --> 02:09:50.549
PEOPLE SHOULD BE EATING- YOU

02:09:50.616 --> 02:09:51.683
KNOW YOU CAN HAVE A LOT OF

02:09:51.750 --> 02:09:52.818
WHEAT OR CORN OR THOSE KIND OF

02:09:52.885 --> 02:09:54.019
THINGS AND- THAT MIGHT BE

02:09:54.086 --> 02:09:55.587
CALLED FOOD SECURITY BUT- YOU

02:09:55.654 --> 02:09:57.689
KNOW HAVING. FRESH VEGETABLES

02:09:57.756 --> 02:09:59.191
AND- YOU KNOW. THIRDS THAT

02:09:59.258 --> 02:10:01.093
GIVES YOU KNOW NATURAL PROTEIN

02:10:01.160 --> 02:10:02.094
AND ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS

02:10:02.161 --> 02:10:03.228
ARE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE

02:10:03.295 --> 02:10:04.997
AND- ALSO IS A HEALTHCARE ISSUE

02:10:05.063 --> 02:10:06.532
IN A COSTUME. AND ALL THOSE

02:10:06.598 --> 02:10:09.768
THINGS SO. ANYWAY YOU KNOW

02:10:09.835 --> 02:10:10.536
THERE'S A MOTHER BASIC

02:10:10.602 --> 02:10:11.837
SOLUTIONS I THINK YOU KNOW THE

02:10:11.904 --> 02:10:12.938
WAY IT GRAVERT TALKS A LOT

02:10:13.005 --> 02:10:14.139
ABOUT- YOU KNOW CUTTING THE

02:10:14.206 --> 02:10:15.340

AGAIN MAKING THAT COLLABORATION

02:10:19.978 --> 02:10:24.850
EASIER I THINK THOSE ARE REALLY.

02:10:24.917 --> 02:10:25.417
IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO BUT-

02:10:25.484 --> 02:10:26.018
