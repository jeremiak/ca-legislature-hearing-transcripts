TO ORDER. THE THIS MEETING OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON NATURAL DISASTER RESPONSE RECOVERY IN REBUILDING. THIS IS A TOUGH THE TOPIC FOR THIS MORNING IS A VERIZON WIRELESS'S DATA THROTTLING HAVE THE MEDICINE A COMPLEX FIREFIGHTERS INTERNET ACCESS. THAT OCCURRED THIS YEAR. I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU AND WELCOME TO EVERYONE WHO IS HERE WITH US. AND I WANNA SAY THANK YOU ESPECIALLY TO MY CO CHAIR MISLI MOAN AND TO THE OTHER MEMBERS WHO HAVE MADE TIME TO BE WITH US THIS MORNING TO TALK ABOUT THIS TOPIC. I ALSO WANT TO THANK THOSE WHO HAVE AGREED TO GIVE TESTIMONY TODAY. LIKE MOST OF YOU I WAS TAKEN ABACK AND FRANKLY THAT'S PUTTING IT MILDLY. TO LEARN THAT A CELLULAR SALES REP COULD HINDER THE EFFORTS OF FIREFIGHTERS WHO WERE RESPONDING TO WHAT HAS TURNED INTO. CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST WILDFIRE IN STATE HISTORY. BUT I WANT TO BE CLEAR EVEN THOUGH WE ARE RIGHT TO BE INDIGNANT. AND EVEN THOUGH WE ARE RIGHT TO BE OUTRAGED WE'RE HERE TODAY TO DO SOMETHING MORE PRODUCTIVE THAN SIMPLY VENTING OUR ANGER. WE ARE LOOKING FOR ANSWERS WE ARE SEARCHING FOR ANSWERS. WE WANT A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING WE WANT TO KNOW. HOW CAN WE GUARANTEE THAT THE WOMEN AND THE MEN WHO PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE FOR US? HAVE THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO PROTECT US. BECAUSE LIKE EVERYONE EVERYTHING ELSE IN OUR LIVES FIRE FIGHTING AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE ARE DEPENDENT ON COMMUNICATION SPECIFICALLY IN THIS CASE MOBILE DATA. IT HAS BECOME. A CRITICAL TOOL. AND IN THE SAME WAY WE WOULD NEVER ACCEPT A WATER DEPARTMENT. SHUTTING OFF HYDRANTS TO GET A BETTER PER GALLON PRICE FOR WATER WE WILL NEVER ACCEPT THAT PUBLIC SAFETY IS LEFT WITHOUT THE TOOLS THEY NEED SIMPLY BECAUSE THE COMPANY HAS A PRICING PLAN. THEY WANT TO MAXIMIZE. SO AGAIN WE AREN'T HERE MERELY TO CASTIGATE ONE PARTICULAR COMPANY. WE'RE HERE TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED AND EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY WHAT WE CAN DO TO ENSURE THAT THIS NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN.

PASADENA CALIFORNIA WERE A STATE THAT'S PRONE TO DISASTERS WHERE THE FIRES THE FLOODS. AND WE HAVE THAT BIG EARTHQUAKE GLOOMY THAT IT CAN OCCUR ANY DAY ANY TIME.

SO IS MY ROLE IS THE FIRE CHIEF IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY ALSO SERVE AS THE CALLOW YES OPERATIONAL AREA FIRE COORDINATOR PROFFER LEGAL AID THAT EITHER LEAVES ARE COUNTING FOR COMES INTO OUR COUNTY. NOW ARE ORGANIZATION IS A VERY ACTIVE ORGANIZATION MANY THE FIRES I HEARD MENTION BEFORE WE CAME UP HERE TODAY. OUR DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL MORE AT WE WERE AT THE THOMAS FIRE WHERE THE FLOODS IN A SANTA BARBARA THE MUD SLIDES -- WE ARE CURRENTLY AT THE MENDOCINO COMPLEX FOR SMALLER LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCY. AND IT IS VERY RARE. TO SEND OUT THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES WE DO BUT WE SHIP [inaudible] ITS MISSION. AND WE SUPPORT OUR PERSONNEL AND WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE A GOVERNING BOARD THAT SPORTS THAT AS WELL THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. SENATOR COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT. EASILY. WE'RE ACTIVE PARTICIPANT AS I SAID IN THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM. WE RESPOND TO ASSIST OUR NEIGHBORS WITH INCIDENTS LARGE AND SMALL. WE LIKE LIKE NEARLY ALL FIRED PERMITS A CALIFORNIA WE ASSIST IN ALL ASPECTS OF THESE EMERGENCIES FROM ACTIVE FIREFIGHTER. INCIDENT MANAGEMENT TO SUPPORT. OUR RESPONSES TO THESE INCIDENTS HAVE REVOLVED HAVE THE BALL TO RELY ON INTERNET BASED SYSTEMS. TO PROVIDE CRITICAL COMMUNICATIONS TO OTHER RESPONDERS AND THE PUBLIC. RESPONDERS RELY ON MOBILE WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY TO COMMUNICATE RESOURCE STATUS PLEASE ORDERS. PROVIDE CRITICAL INCIDENT INFORMATION. AND DEVELOP INTO ACTION PLANS WHICH IS THE PLANNING TOOL WE USE TO MANAGE THESE LARGE MARKET. SIX THE PUBLIC RELIES ON OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE THEM INFORMATION ABOUT EVACUATIONS IT'S THAT MAPS RECOVERY RESOURCES. AND OTHER SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS THAT ARE FREQUENTLY CRITICAL TO THEIR SAFETY. OUR ABILITY TO CONNECT MAINTAIN INTERNET CONNECTIVITY. IS CRITICAL TO OUR PUBLIC SAFETY MISSION UNFORTUNATELY. OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS WE EXPERIENCE A SITUATION WHERE OUR CAR CONNECTIVITY WAS THROTTLED BY A PROVIDER. THIS OCCURRED JUST DESPITE SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR ACCOUNT REPRESENTATIVE. THAT THE DEVICES WERE PROVIDING ESSENTIAL SERVICES. LAWLER FIRE FIREBALLS FIREFIGHTERS WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY. A WORKAROUND WHY WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR SERVICE PROVIDER. I FOUND THE SITCH I FOUND THE SITUATION PERSONALLY TO BE UNACCEPTABLE. I BELIEVE THE NEED FOR CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES. AND THE PUBLIC WE SERVE. TO HAVE ACCESS TO A ROBUST WIRELESS NETWORK DURING LARGE EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS IS CRITICAL. THE PUBLIC SAFETY. I THINK YOU GET FOR HERE EARLY THIS MORNING AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS HAVE. THANK YOU CHIEF -- YOU YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE USE OF DATA [inaudible] AND THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE THAT YOU WENT THROUGH THAT. ALMOST EVERY CONSUMER GOES THROUGH THEMSELVES THEY HAVE TO SELECT A DATA PLAN [inaudible] FOR THEIR PHONE SERVICE AND WHAT IS THAT PROCESS LIKE. FOR A FIRE AGENCY. AND HOW OFTEN DO YOU DO THAT. AND HOW HOW IS IT DIFFERENT FROM. WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOUR PERSONALLY I TRYING TO DO? IT IS DIFFERENT WE DO YOU HAVE THE MAJOR ACCOUNTS MANAGER THAT WE WORK WITH -- THAT ALONE IS SPECIFIC TO GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTS TO HELP US DETERMINE WHAT THAT PLAYERS SHOULD BE THEY ARE LOW BUT COMPLICATED BASED ON OUR NEEDS AND OUR SERVICE. AND YOU KNOW IN THIS CASE -- WE HAD A PREVIOUS INCIDENT. EARLY DECEMBER WHERE THERE WERE THROTTLING AND THERE'S IF I COULD JUST ASK YOU BEFORE YOU CONTINUETO KEEP CERTAIN OF THE MICROPHONE A LITTLE CLOSER TO YOU. THANK YOU THERE YOU. SO WHEN WE CHOOSE OUR REPLY WE WORK WITH OUR MAJOR ACCOUNTS -- MANAGER. WE DID FIRST EXPERIENCE THROTTLING ISSUE IN DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND OUR ACCOUNTS MANAGER WAS RESPONSIVE IT WAS -- THAT RESULTED IN IT BEING ELIMINATED IN ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES AFTER REQUEST WAS MADE. AND WE WORKED WITH OUR PROVIDER TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR PLAN I WOULD NOT BE THROTTLED IN THE FUTURE. AS NORMAL ON PUBLIC SAFETY YOU HAVE TIMES WHEN YOU'RE VERY BUSY LIKE RIGHT NOW. WHEN YOU HAVE TIMES WHEN YOU'RE NOT VERY BUSY -- BETWEEN DECEMBER. AND THE FIRES THAT BEGAN IN JUNE. FOUND WE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF DOWNTIME AND OUR DEVICES WERE UTILIZED AS HEAVILY [inaudible] IN JUNE. OUR SUPPORT UNIT WAS DEPLOYED AGAIN. A TWO THE PARTY FIRE AND INTO THE MENDOCINO COMPLEX. A WHILE AT THE POINTY IT YEAH. IT BEGAN TO EXPERIENCE THROTTLING AGAIN. WE AGAIN WORK THROUGH OUR SERVICE PROVIDER WE ARE UNABLE TO GET A HOLD OF OUR ACCOUNTS MANAGER AT THAT TIME. SO LIKE THE GENERAL PUBLIC. OUR IT OFFICER DO WHATEVER HE COULD TO WORK THROUGH THE GENERAL CUSTOMER SERVICE LINE -- WAS ABLE TO GET A HOLD TECH SUPPORT. AND LIFT THE THROTTLING ON THAT UNIT. ALBEIT VERY TEMPORARILY. NOW WE DID CHANGE PLANS AT THAT TIME -- TO A SLIGHTLY HIGHER ALERT HIGHER RATE PLAN. AND THEN THEY WENT TO THE MENDOCINO COMPLEX. AT THE MENACING OF COMPLEX THERE AGAIN EXPERIENCING PROUDLY. IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT WE CONTINUE TO CONTACT OUR OWN ACCOUNTS MANAGER. AND HAVE SENTINEL DOUBLE EMAILS. LEFT PHONE MESSAGES WERE ABLE TO GET A HOLD OF OUR ACCOUNTS MANAGER IN A TIMELY MANNER. DURING THIS TIME OUR IT STAFF WORKED VERY DILIGENTLY TO DEVELOP WORKAROUNDS. THEY LIT UP THE HOT SPOT ON ONE OF THE ADJACENT UNITS PHONE FOR THEM TO USE. HOW WE OVERNIGHT SHIFT ANOTHER PROVIDERS? CARD AND ROUTING DEVICE. AND WE WERE ABLE TO GET THAT UP AND RUNNING BY THE NEXT DAY. BEFORE THE SITUATION WAS RESOLVED. THEY'RE CONTINUING TO UTILIZE THAT REDUNDANT A DEVICE -- AT THIS POINT AND THEY STILL REMAIN ATENCIO COMPLEX. YOU IN IN SOME OF THE ACCOUNTS DISCUSS HOW INFORMATION IS COMMUNICATED THROUGH AND OH YES FIVE SIXTY TWO DEVICE CAN YOU TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT. SURE I'D ACTUALLY LIKE TO HAVE MY DEPUTY CHIEF OF OPERATIONS JUST PROVIDE YOU A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF WHAT THAT UNIT IS. ON IT IS A SUPPORT UNIT -- THAT A WE STAFF AS A SIGN THE FOR CALIFORNIA STATE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES FIFTH GLASS. SO GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS BRYAN GLASS OPERATIONS CHIEF FOR SENATOR COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT -- INCIDENTS SUPPORT VEHICLE THAT -- WE PARTNER WITH WITH THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES TO SEND OUT UPON THEIR REQUEST TO COORDINATE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT MUTUAL AID OF RESOURCES -- THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA'S ONE OF THE LARGEST -- STATES AND MOVES THE MOST AMOUNT OF RESOURCES DURING A GIVEN TIME -- SO WE'LL MOVE RESOURCES FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO NORTHERN CALIFORNIA NORTHERN CALIFORNIA TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND ALL OF THAT IS COORDINATED THROUGH THESE INCIDENTS SUPPORT VEHICLES. THERE SEVEN OF THEM LOCATED THROUGHOUT -- CALIFORNIA BASED ON THAT WE ASK YOU -- TO BREAKDOWN AND SANTA CLARA COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT PROVIDES THE STAFFING ON THOSE UNITS SO IS RESOURCES ARE COMING IN FROM ALL THE DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS ARE THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- FEDERAL RESOURCES ARE COORDINATED THEIR DOD FISH AND WILDLIFE BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS -- UNITED STATES FOREST SERVICE ALL THOSE RESOURCES ARE PASSING THROUGH THE YES FIFTY TO SIXTY TWO VEHICLE FOR ACCOUNTABILITY. RESOURCE TRACKING -- ASSIGNMENT REASSIGNMENT AS WELL AS ALL THE FINANCIAL -- PAPERWORK THAT IS BEING TRACKED -- THROUGH THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES MUTUAL AID -- THE VEHICLE USES A HIGH AMOUNT OF DATA BECAUSE IT IT'S TRACKING IN NEAR REAL TIME THE MOVEMENT OF THE SOVIET GOALS -- THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND AS URGENCY IS BREAK IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THOSE RESOURCES MAY NEED TO BE REDIRECTED TO IN NEW AND EMERGING THREATS WITHIN THE STATE -- SO THIS VEHICLE -- IS IS A HUB OF ACTIVITY ON ANY CONNECTS WITH THE OPERATIONS CENTER HERE INSIDE -- SAN SACRAMENTO -- SO THAT ARE THOSE RESOURCES ARE NEEDED MOST -- AND WE HAD THE PLEASURE OF STAFFING THAT WITH THEM IT'S A JOINT PARTNERSHIP -- AND THAT IS -- KIND OF A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF SOME OF THE DATA USES THAT THERE THAT ARE REQUIRED ARE LIKE I SAID APPARATUS ROUTING TRACKING MAPPING -- INCIDENT MAPS INCIDENT ACTION PLAN DISSEMINATION AS WELL AS WE'VE HAD A REALLY GOOD -- PARTNERSHIP WITH THEIR NATIONAL GUARD IN THE UNMANNED AERIAL. VEHICLES AND THE LIVE FEED OF VIDEO DATA THAT IS FLOWN DURING THE EVENING HOURS AND THEN PUSH DOWN SO WE CAN HAVE ACTUALLY LIVE. FOOTAGE FLOWING INTO THAT VEHICLE SO THAT -- OPERATIONAL COMMANDERS ON THE GROUND CAN MAKE DECISIONS AND IN NEAR REAL TIME ABOUT WHERE THEY NEED TO DEPLOY ASSETS THAT ARE ON THE FIRE -- OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A LOT OF THE ISSUE AROUND OUR OUR DATA NEED IS LIVE STREAMING VIDEO. THANK YOU FOR DESCRIBING THAT IN A DIFFERENT RANGE OF OF DATA THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE USING BECAUSE THESE ARE THINGS THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT AND ALSO THESE. SOUND LIKE HIGH DATA USE FILES YES AS WELL WHAT IT AND THIS IS A DEVICE THAT KNOWN MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ABOUT AS WELL. WATER THAT WAS THE RANGE OF DEVICES THAT YOU'RE UTILIZING HOW DO YOU MANAGE ALL OF THOSE DEVICES AND THEN HOW DO YOU ALSO MAY. ALL OF THE PLANS THAT EACH DEVICE MUST BE ON YOU ARE TALK. SO RIGHT NOW WE HAVE -- FOR OUR DEPARTMENT WERE NOT ONLY LARGE TO PAY FOR IT OR ABOUT FIFTEEN STATION THAT'S A WERE MEDIUM SIZE ORGANIZATION. AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT DEVICES THAT ARE KIND CONNECTED YOU'RE STILL LOOKING AT I THINK SOMEWHERE IN THE RANGE OF OVER THREE HUNDRED DEVICES -- AND THAT INCLUDES HOT SPOTS ON IPADS PHONE CELLULAR PHONES -- ROUTERS EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR APPARATUS HAS A CREEL POINT THE VICE WHICH HOLDS THE SIM CARDS. AND CREEKS THAT WIFI HOTSPOT OVER OUR VEHICLES -- WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE IS SOMETHING SIMPLE AS A PATIENT CARE REPORT DURING AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL CALL? BACK IT'S UPLOADED THROUGH THAT SYSTEM AND SENT TO THE HOSPITAL AUTOMATICALLY OVER WIRELESS. ON THERE'S A LOT OF USES FOR WIRELESS IN THE FIRE SERVICE WE HAVE QUITE A FEW DEVICES THAT ARE ALL CONNECTED WE DO HAVE AN INTERNAL IT STAFF THAT MANAGES THAT WORKS DIRECTLY WITH OUR ACCOUNT. REPRESENTATIVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MANAGE THAT PLAN APPROPRIATELY. SO FOR ALL THESE DEVICES THEY COULD BE SITTING IDLE. NOT USING DATA. AND TELL THE EVENTS THAT OCCUR IS THAT YOU NEED THAT DATA -- YOU HOW HOW DO YOU. JACKSON OR PLANNED. FOR WHAT SERVICE WOULD BE REQUIRED IN A CIRCUMSTANCE LIKE THAT IS EFFICIENT IS OUR DIFFERENT WAY TO DO IT THAT MIGHT BE MORE RESPONSIVE. TO YOUR AGENCIES NEEDS AND THE REAL USE OF THIS EQUIPMENT. BUT THAT THAT'S A REALLY GREAT QUESTION THANK YOU FOR THAT THE ON THE THING ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY IS IT IS. VERY DIFFICULT AS HARD AS WE TRY AND WE ANALYZE THE DATA TO PREDICT WHEN EVENTS ARE GONNA HAPPEN. WHETHER BE A SMALL DENT WHERE THERE BE A LARGE EVENT. SO THERE ARE TIMES THAT YOU HAVE DOWNTIME THERE ARE TIMES THAT AND YOU HAVE A HUGE SPIKES IN YOUR NEEDS WHEN IT COMES TO DATA. BUT WE HAVE A SET OF PLANS ARE REALLY BASED -- FOR AGENCIES OR CONSUMERS. THAT CAN PLAN OUT. THEIR DATA NEED BASED ON HISTORICAL USAGE MONTH BY MONTH. THAT'S NOT THE CASE WITH PUBLIC SAFETY. SO YOU HAVE TO FIND A BALANCE YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH YOUR ACCOUNT MATTER WHEN WE ARE A MEDIUM SIZED PERMIT WE DO NOT HAVE UNLIMITED FUNDS. AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE SELECT THE PLAN IT MEETS OUR NEEDS. BUT IT ALSO IS NOT A PLAN THAT IS SO EXPENSIVE IT COMES AT A COST OF STAFFING. AND WE'RE ALL CONSTANTLY TRYING TO FIND THAT BALANCE. WHEN WORKING WITH THESE PLANTS THAT REALLY ARE BASED TOWARDS CONSUMERS? VERSES THE ALONG. THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF PUBLIC SAFETY. YOU MAKE A REALLY GOOD POINT ABOUT DOWN SEEN. THESE PLANS WITH. THE COST OF ANOTHER FIREFIGHTER. HE'S ABLE TO PROTECT THE COMMUNITY AS WELL AND THE BUDGETARY. PRESSURES THAT THAT YOU'RE UNDER. DO YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE SERVICE PROVIDER. AND WHAT WHAT DOES THAT THE SERVICE PROVIDER. SECTOR LOOK LIKE FROM A FIRINGS AGENCY PERSPECTIVE AS TO WHO IS -- SELLING PRODUCTS THAT. YOUR SECTOR IS THEN LOOKING AT AND AND THINKING THIS MEETS OUR NEEDS ARE THERE ONLY A COUPLE THAT YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE FROM. AND WHAT IS THAT SELECTION PROCESS LIKE. SO FOR OUR AGENCY WERE WERE LITTLE UNIQUE WE SERVE SEVEN DIFFERENT CITIES -- INCLUDE A LARGE PORTION OF SANTA CRUZ MOUNTAIN RANGE AND SO FOR US IT'S COVERAGE WE'RE LOOKING WE'RE LOOKING AT COVERAGE WE DO HAVE MORE THAN ONE SERVICE PROVIDER. ON THE WE ARE LOOKING AT WAYS TO ALWAYS INCREASE REDUNDANCY. ARM OF ONE PROVIDERS COVERAGE IS BETTER THAN THE OTHER -- I'M SORRY CAN YOU REPEAT THE SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION SO I MEAN IF YOU COULD PLEASE TELL US YOUR SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE AND HOW YOU TALK ABOUT COVERAGE BEING THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. WE ARE THERE OTHER AREAS WHERE THE COVERAGE IS BETTER FOR A DIFFERENT PROVIDER AND SO YOU'RE YOU KNOW SISTER AGENCIES OF COURSE ARE GOING FOR THEM BECAUSE THEY WANT TO DO WITH THE MOUNTAINOUS. AREAS THAT YOU'VE GOT BUT MAYBE HAVE FLATTER AREA WHERE DIFFERENT PROVIDER WORKS THAT WOULD LOVE TO KNOW WHO YOUR OTHER PROVIDERS BESIDES VERIZON SURE I CAN SPEAK FOR OUR AGENCY WHICH IS A RIGHT NOW VERIZON IN. EIGHTEEN EIGHTY I'M SORRY CHIEF CAGES REPEAT THAT ONE MORE TIME I PEAK FOR OUR AGENCY ARE NOT THE OTHERS BUT FAR AGENCIES VERIZON IN A TNT. GREAT THANK YOU MISLI NOT. THANK YOU ANDA. YEAH THERE'S A HERE AS YOU DESCRIBE SITUATIONS I ALSO HEARD YOU REFLECT ON THE FACT THAT YOU ARE PART OF THE A REALLY A STATEWIDE EFFORT YOU'VE BEEN IT NOT JUST IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY YOU'VE BEEN IN MULTIPLE COUNTIES SINCE I WON I THINK MORE. OF A BROAD LEAF FROM. THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE STATE AND THIS WAS A A SITUATION THAT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S HAPPENED TWICE ONE DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN FOR TWENTY MINUTES AND ONE SOUNDS LIKE A DAY. SOMETHING LIKE THAT A DAY -- MORE RECENTLY I THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT I HEARD AND IS THIS SOMETHING THAT YOU SEE AS A PATTERN IN SOME OF THE OTHER FIRES THAT YOU'VE BEEN IN. IS THIS REALLY KIND OF NARROWED DOWN TO THESE TWO INSTANCES AND I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOU CAN SPEAK ON THAT SINCE -- YOU'VE BEEN PART OF OF HIM. MULTIPLE FIRES IN MULTIPLE COUNTIES AND CITIES IN OUR STATE I'M ALSO RECOGNIZING AND THAT THE REGIONS ARE DIFFERENT -- A FIRE IN THE HEART OF SANTA BARBARA MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN -- ONE IN A RURAL I'M AREA IN CALIFORNIA. FOR ARE AGENCY WE WE'VE HAD THREE AND STE INSTANCES ALONE WITH THE SPECIFIC UNIT -- OF OF IDENTIFIED. FOR THE AT OTHER AGENCIES -- I I CAN'T SPEAK TO WHETHER THEY HAVE BEEN THROTTLED OR NOT -- I CAN TELL YOU THAT -- WHEN YOU'RE ON THESE EVENTS AND I'VE AS YOU MENTIONED ASSEMBLYMEMBER. THEY CAN BE -- IN MODOC. WHERE THEY CAN BE OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY AND AND YOUR COVERAGE WILL VARY -- IT IS NOT UNCOMMON. FOR FIREFIGHTERS AT BASE CAMP TO SWITCH BETWEEN EACH OTHER'S PHONES SO THAT THEY CAN CONTACT FAMILY BASED ON COVERAGE BASED ON OF THEIR ABILITY TO ACCESS DATA. ON WE HAVE TO REMEMBER. THAT ON THE PUBLIC SAFETY SIDE IT IS. AND CRITICAL THAT WE HAVE ACCESS BUT WE'RE ALSO SUPPORTING ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT ARE ARE GONE. FOR TWO WEEKS FROM THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR ABILITY TO BE ABLE. TO CONTACT HER FAMILY AS CRITICAL AS WELL SO I CAN SPEAK ON THEIR PERSONAL EXPERIENCES BECAUSE I PERSONALLY LED THE STRIKE TEAMS -- BUT AS FAR AS OTHER AGENCIES PHONE. EXPERIENCE THROTTLING I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT. AND MADAM CHAIR WAS -- THOMAS FIRE IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE PAWNEE FIRE IN JUNE OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND THE MENDOCINO COMPLEX IN JULY THINK YOU AND I LESS THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS AGO. THAT WE SAW THAT -- THE PROVIDER THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SIDE. MADE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS TO THEIR PROGRAM OVERALL THAT WOULD TRY -- TO ENSURE THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN AGAIN FROM YOUR PRINT WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS AND REACTIONS -- IN ENTER AND I AM AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAD A CHANCE TO TO SEE -- BAIL WHAT THEY WILL BE DOING MOVING FORWARD I WANT TO SPEAK FOR THEM BUT I'M JUST CURIOUS -- IN IN TERMS OF YOUR THOUGHTS AND REACTIONS I TO THEIR PROPOSED PLAN MOVING FORWARD. SO I HAVE NOT SEEN THEIR PROPOSED PLAN -- BUT I WILL SAY THIS PERSONALLY OWNED. WITH MY STAFF THEY KNOW I'D RATHER KEEP MY HEAD DOWN WORK HARD DIDN'T SPEAK PUBLICLY. HOUSE SPEAKER TO MY WIFE LAST NIGHT. AND SHE SAID IF THIS MAKES A DIFFERENCE FOR THE FIRE SERVICE MOVING FORWARD. YOU NEED TO BE IN THERE BE STRONG. AND PUSH FOR CHANGE SO THAT THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN TO ANY OTHER FIRE SERVICE PROVIDER. AND THAT RESONATED WITH ME. I'VE REALLY TRULY HOPE THAT WHAT COMES OUT OF THIS IS THAT A GREATER PARTNERSHIP IN MOVING FORWARD THAT THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN AGAIN TO ANY OTHER PUBLIC HE'S. AND I APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS I THINK USED UP THE WORD PARTNERSHIP -- I THINK HAD TO GUESS MY GUESS IS THAT ALL OF THOSE AND THAT ARE SITTING ON THIS DIETS WOULD WANT THE SAME THING THAT THIS IS IT I'M SOMETHING THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN. I'M AGAIN I KNOW THAT EVERY MINUTES I HAVING LIVED. THE THOMAS WILDFIRE EVERY SECOND AND MINUTE MEANT SOMETHING TO US -- AND I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS I COMING HERE AND SHARING THAT WITH US AND MY FINAL QUESTION IS. THINKING NOW NOT JUST RELATED TO THIS INCIDENT -- BUT REFLECTING ON THAT WORD PARTNERSHIP. ARE THERE ANY OTHER AGENCIES ARE INDUSTRIES THAT WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT PARTNERING WITH TO IDENTIFY. A BIG PROBLEM A COMMON PROBLEM AND OUTSIDE OF JUST THE SPACE IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE THAT YOUR SCENE AND THAT IS AN ISSUE TO OUR PUBLIC SAFETY IN A WAY -- THAT SHOULD WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT NOW -- AND AND AND MAYBE NOT WHEN WE WE WE SEE A PROBLEM. I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS ESPECIALLY WITH OF THE LARGE AMOUNT OF FIRES WE'VE HAD OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. AND THERE'S OPPORTUNITY EXISTS. IF YOU HAD A FIRE IN YOUR JURISDICTION YOU MAY HAVE LOST A SOUL FLIGHT. A AND THEY ARE REBUILDING SULFITES. I THINK HARDENING OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. PROTECT THE CELL SITE WHATEVER THE PROPRIETOR SHOULD BE A PRIORITY SO ACCESS OWNED. CAN BE AVAILABLE IS ROBUST -- THERE IS BACKUP SYSTEMS OUR GENERATOR SYSTEMS TO KEEP THEM UP AND RUNNING THERE'S  LOT OF INFRASTRUCTURE HARDENING THAT WE CAN DO TO SUPPORT THE OVERALL SYSTEM. AND NOT JUST FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. SO REPUBLICAN ACTUALLY GET THE MESSAGE. THAT WE ARE TRYING TO PUT OUT TO THEM TO CRITICAL INFORMATION THEY NEED TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AS WELL. THAT WOULD BE PROBABLY THE ONE STRONG RECOMMENDATION I WOULD HAVE AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN. MAKE SURE WE DON'T MISS THE OPPORTUNITY. AS WE REBUILD A LOT OF THE SITES TO HARDEN THEM. AND I THINK AS THOSE ARE POWERFUL COMMENTS RIGHT NOT MISSING THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO BETTER -- TO REBUILD AND DO WHATEVER IS NEEDED I'M TO ENSURE THAT THE PARTNERSHIP IS STRONG AND BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT CALIFORNIANS WANT AND NEED I'M PARTICULARLY IN EMERGENCY SERVICES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. TWO OTHER MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS AT THIS POINT MISS AMERICA HAVE JUST SEVERAL BASIC QUESTION I'M ASKED THE OTHERS AS WELL IN RETROSPECT SINCE YOU HAD THE INITIAL. THROTTLING IN DECEMBER. BUT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE DIFFERENT. THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION WE I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING DIFFERENT GIVEN THE RESPONSE THAT WE INITIALLY RECEIVED. THE RESPONSE WE INITIALLY RECEIVED RACKET DECEMBER WAS POSITIVE IT WAS HANDLED WITHIN TWENTY MINUTES -- WE BEGAN THEN LOOKING AT REDUNDANT SYSTEMS ON TO FURTHER STRENGTHEN OUR FLEET. AND BECAUSE WE HAD STARTED THAT WORK WE WERE ABLE TO OVERNIGHT SHIP ANOTHER DEVICE WE ARE LOOKING INTO -- I THINK THAT. FORESIGHT BY MY STAFF AT THAT TIME LED TO THE SUCCESSFUL RECOVERY. ADVOCACY NO COMPLEX. WOULD YOU HAVE ELEVATED THAT THE YOUR CONCERN AND THE DECEMBER AREA TO A TIME FRAME. UP TO MANAGEMENT OF THE PROVIDER HOME. AT THAT TIME I THOUGHT WE DID BECAUSE WE ARE WORKING THROUGH OUR MAJOR ACCOUNTS -- MANAGER -- AT THAT TIME. AND AGAIN WE WERE WORKING TOWARDS A SOLUTION. BASED ON OUR NEEDS. AND BRING INDEED REDUNDANT PROVIDERS WAS RECOGNIZED BY OUR STAFF AS A AS A CRITICAL NEED AND WE BEGIN IMMEDIATELY WORKING ON THAT. AS THE REPRESENTATIVE WITH AMONGST A COUPLE OF YEARS WE HAVE THE MIND OF SEEING A FIRE I'VE HAD THE LAKE YOU NAME ALL THE LAKE COUNTY FIRES I'VE HAD. AT 50% OF MY LAND HAS BEEN DESTROYED. SO THIS IS -- DIFFICULT FOR ME BECAUSE I'M ALWAYS GOING TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF MY OF FIRST RESPONDERS PROBABLY -- THERE THEY TOPOGRAPHY. IN MOVIES AREAS IS DIFFICULT. AND IT IS DIFFICULT I THINK FOR ANY PROVIDER TO GET TO SOME OF THESE AREAS. WITH THAT BEING SAID. WE FOUGHT FOR LONG TIME TRYING TO GET SOME KIND OF COVERAGE OUT IN THESE AREAS NOT ONLY FOR THE FIREFIGHTERS BUT PEOPLE THEY GET STRANDED IN SOME OF THESE REALLY DESOLATE AREAS. AND SO -- I'M JUST A CONCERNED ABOUT WHERE WE'RE GONNA GO FROM HERE. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE ALL SAFE. AND AS WELL AS OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE SAFE SO -- HOPEFULLY WE CAN COME OUT WITH SOME KIND OF A DISCUSSION OF HOW WE'RE GONNA FEET FIX THE SCOREBOARD FOR YOU. THANK YOU IS OURCAREER THEIR ANY OTHER QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME IS MISTER ANDREAS. MUCH RECRUITMENT OPENING STATEMENT SO THERE'S THERE'S COME LIKE MOBILE COMMAND CENTERS I TAKE IT RIGHT AND I THINK YOU SAID THERE'S LIKE SEVEN THROUGHOUT THE STATE. BY CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICE AND A DEPENDING ON THE STATE OR THE COUNTY OR THE AGENCY THAT THERE TO HANDLE. IN THE ROM AND I GUESS BECAUSE OF THAT POUNDS OR THE WAY THEY PERFORM JUST EXIT YOUR MEDIUM SIZE DEPARTMENT. I'M COME FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SO I DO A LOT WITH LIKE LA COUNTY FIRE SO THE MORE RESOURCES AND MORE FUNDING FOR THAT'S I GUESS IT JUST DEPENDS ON ON THAT -- FLAG GET MORE UNDERSTANDING SO THICK MOBILE COMMAND CENTERS IT STRATEGICALLY PLACED WORKING IN CONJUNCTION WITH OH YES -- DOWNLOADS DISTURB ME TALK BUT THIS IS WHAT I GUESS THE THIRD TIME YOU'VE HAD ISSUE WITH PRALINE WITH -- OR WHAT THE INDUSTRY SO OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE ISSUES THERE I WISH. THOSE RULE OF GOTTEN TAKING CARE OF THE FIRST TIME RIGHT -- SO WITH THAT SAID I AM EAGER TO HEAR MOVING FORWARD WE CAN DO TO TO MAKE THINGS BETTER SO THIS DOESN'T OCCUR AGAIN. I THINK -- SOME REMEMBERING TO TALK ABOUT THE TIME FRAME WITH THINGS. ELECT REFER TO WHICH I SAID EARLIER ABOUT. EMERGENCIES HAPPEN AT ANY MINUTE OF THE DAY I DON'T CARE FOR ITS SUNDAY A HOLIDAY. YOU GUYS ARE WORKING TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE THE HOLIDAY. WEEKEND HOME WITH YOUR THEIR TIME AWAY FROM FAMILY AND FRIENDS TO DO THE JOB AND BECAUSE OF THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE EVERYTHING READY TO GO AT MOMENTS NOTICE BECAUSE THESE THINGS HAPPEN SECONDS. AND THINGS CHANGE FROM MINUTE TO MINUTE RIGHT ESPECIALLY GOT BIG DISASTERS AND TALKING ABOUT COVERAGE I'M MORE ONE OUT WERE BACK IN THE FILM AND SOME OF THESE AREAS. YOU KNOW YOU'RE OUR MEMORY YOU KNOW US COLLEGE WORKING FIREPLACES OR YOU KNOW I GOT THIS KIND OF PHONE IS NOT WORKING I CAN'T CONNECTS OR LIKE WHAT YOU WERE PROVIDED YOU GOT IN YOUR WITH THREE THREE OR FOUR OF US WE HAVE DIFFERENT PLANS DIFFERENT PROVIDERS. AND IT'S LIKE UP TO THAT PERSON OKAY YEAH YOU GOT COVER JUST USE YOUR PHONE. IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT WAY RIGHT IN ESTO SEES PAGLIA INITIAL LIKE THAT IN SOME OF THESE AREAS AS WELL YOU KNOW -- MY COLLEAGUES TALKED ABOUT THE ROLE AREAS RIGHT THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO MAKE SURE HOW DO WE ARE ARE IN THOSE AREAS. AND WORKING TOGETHER PUBLIC SAFETY BECAUSE IT'S A LOT JUST THINK OF THAT PERSON OUT THERE BY THEMSELVES STRANDED ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD -- WITHOUT OR THANK YOU ALL FOR THE WORK YOU DO. AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN SHARE MORE LA SHED MORE LIGHT ON WHAT OCCURRED AND MAKE SURE THAT. INCIDENTS LIKE THIS DON'T OCCUR AGAIN BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A FIRE. THINK ABOUT THE BIG EARTHQUAKE WE TALK ABOUT IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. WHAT THAT'S GOING TO DO TO OUR INFRASTRUCTURE A MAIN ROADS ARE GONNA BE BLOCKED OF ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSPORT ANYTHING ANYWHERE HOW WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER? ENOUGH THAT PRESENT ANY CHALLENGES. TO OUR INFRASTRUCTURE SPECIAL INCOMES DO INTERNET CONNECTION. SO THANK YOU FOR THE TIME APPROACHING. BUT BIGGEST RODRIGUEZ MISS WALDRON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR REALLY GROUP BRIEFLY I MEAN THE ISSUE ALL OF REDUNDANCY IS SO CRITICAL -- JUST FOR PERSONAL INCIDENT JUST WAS ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS HAD ARE. A TRIP UP TO FALL RIVER WHICH WAS CUT SHORT -- DUE TO FIRE UP IS -- PICKED RIVER AND IT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE SOME OF US WERE SEPARATED SOME OF US HAD SELF SERVICE SOME OF US DIDN'T AND WE HAD DIFFERENT PROVIDERS AND ACTUALLY MUSLIM OWN AND I HAVE THE SAME. PROVIDER WHICH WAS ACTUALLY WORKING WITH LIKE ONE BAR. AND IT WOULD DROP YOU KNOW BUT YOU COULD BUT THE ISSUES THAT WE ENCOUNTERED NOT HAVING POWER. SO WE COULD EVEN CHARGE OUR PHONES WHEN THEY DIED YOU KNOW. NOW HAVING THE REDUNDANCY THE HARDENING OF THE ANSWER INFRASTRUCTURE -- YOU KNOW CRITICAL AND WHAT WE ALWAYS FOUND IN OUR INCIDENTS IS INTER AGENCY COMMUNICATION BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MUCH MUTUAL AID COMING IN. AND FOLKS NOT YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO COMMUNICATE EVEN IN THIS DAY AND AGE WHICH YOU KNOW THAT HAS TO BE A PRIORITY FOR US. AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU MISS WALDRON GOT A FEW FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS. YOU MENTION THAT YOU GOT TO PROVIDERS EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN VERIZON GIVE TO PROVIDERS ON EVERY DEVICE OR YOU HAVE TO HAVE DIFFERENT DEVICES [inaudible] PROVIDERS. I DO KNOW HOW BOTH PROVIDERS ON EVERY DEVICE -- EVERY ONE OF OUR WILL SAY ENGINES THE BE VARIOUS TYPES ON WE'LL HAVE THE A WHAT WE CALL CREE TO PUT DEVICE ON THAT CAN HOUSE MULTIPLE -- SIM CARDS HOW WE ARE TESTING A SINGLE PROVIDER RIGHT NOW NON. AI DOWN TESTED FOR COVERAGE -- HOW ROBUST IS ON MAKING SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE SAME ISSUES -- THAT WE FACED IN THE IN THE PAST SO WE ARE CURRENTLY TESTING ON PROVIDERS AND THEN WE WILL MOVE TO A ROLLOUT -- FOR ALL OF OUR APPARATUS BUT I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE ALONE. THE COMMENT I MADE PREVIOUSLY. ON WE ARE CONSTANTLY HAS I LEARNED IN THIS POSITION TRYING TO BALANCE YOUR BUDGET TRYING TO WORK WITHIN THE DOLLARS THAT YOU HAVE. IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE DO HAVE TWO PROVIDERS FOR REDUNDANCY -- BASED ON THE SPORADIC NEED OF OUR OWN INDUSTRY. THAT'S DOUBLE THE COST. TO ADD TO PROVIDERS ON BOTH ON ALL OUR RIGS. AND WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGHT FOR STAFFING KEEP FOR STOPPING THAT THAT BECOMES A CHALLENGE. CAN YOU TAKE US TO THE INCIDENT THAT OCCURRED WHERE WAS YOUR CREEL. AND CAN YOU CAN YOU HOW MUCH DETAIL CAN YOU GIVE US ABOUT WHERE AT THE EVENT AT THE FIRE WHERE THEY STATION. TRYING TO DO THEIR WORK SO THIS SUPPORT UNIT WILL OPERATE IN BASE CAMP WHO THINK ABOUT BASE CAMP AS A MINI CITY IF YOU WILL. FOUND THIS IS THE FULL SUPPORT STRUCTURE FOR THE ENTIRE INCIDENT -- WE HAVE FINANCES LOGISTICS OF OPERATIONS YOUR PLAN -- ALL OF THEM RELY ON CONNECTIVITY. ON TO THE INTERNET TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE. AND THEY'RE CONSTANTLY WORKING TO MAKE SURE THOSE RESOURCES ARE TRACKED. AND THEY'RE PUT INTO THE RIGHT PLACES. FINANCE TRACKING IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT [inaudible] NO. PUTTING TOGETHER A PLAN AN OPERATIONAL PLAN EVERY SINGLE DAY SO WHEN THE FIREFIGHTERS GO OUT ON THE NEXT OPERATIONAL PERIOD. THEY HAVE THE PLAYBOOK IF YOU WILL AND THEY'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE IT TAKES QUITE A BIT OF WORK IN COORDINATION. OUR UNIT IS RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT IT SUPPORTS THAT. ON THIS YEAR IT IS. BEST DESCRIBED AS A MOBILE OFFICE ON WHEELS SO THEY PARK IT -- ITSELF SUSTAINABLE. THEY GET INTO THE BACK OFFICE AND BILL BE CALIFORNIA -- OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SIR -- SERVICES CHIEFS THEN THERE THAT THEY WILL BE SUPPORTING -- IN THIS COORDINATION EFFORT. AND SO IF YOU'RE DESCRIBING THIS YOU HAVE. OTHER FIREFIGHTERS OUT FIGHTING THE FIRES RELYING ON DATA FROM THIS UNIT. AND WHERE THEY DELAYED IN GETTING THE INFORMATION THEY NEEDED. BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO GET THE IN FOR THE INFORMATION ON HOW TO FIGHT THE FIRE. HOW TO DEPLOY EQUIPMENT A PUSH OUT FROM THE BASE CAMP DID DID THAT OCCUR TO OTHER UNITS ARE NOT JUST SANTA CLARA UNITS BUT? OTHERS THAT YOU'RE SUPPORTING AT THAT TIME. LIKE I MENTIONED ALONE PREVIOUSLY I'M I'M VERY BLESSED TO HAVE A ON A WONDERFUL IT STAFF AND STAFF ON THAT UNIT THAT WERE IMMEDIATELY ABLE TO IDENTIFY SOME WORKAROUNDS. WHICH INCLUDE TURNING ON HOT SPOTS ON MOBILE PHONES. AND OVERNIGHT SHIPPING A ANOTHER SERVICE PROVIDER THERE SO WE WERE ABLE TO OPERATE -- WE HAD A SHORT PERIOD OF REDUCED -- DOWNTIME. NAM BUT WE WERE ABLE TO MAINTAIN OPERATIONS CITY DID NOT IMPACT THE OPERATIONS OF THAT FIRE. IN THE EARLIER THROTTLING INCIDENT YOU TALK ABOUT HOW QUICKLY IT WAS TO HAVE THAT FIXED. AND HOW THE THROTTLE IN REMOVED YOU ABLE TO GET IN TOUCH WITH YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE BUT IN THIS INSTANCE THAT WAS NOT THE CASE -- WAS THERE -- AN EXPLANATION AS TO WHY THERE WAS DELAY IN ADDRESSING THE ISSUE THAT THAT YOU'D MENTIONED OR OR YOU KNOW. WAS THERE SOMETHING ELSE I WAS TRYING TO COMMUNICATE TO YOU FROM THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REP HOW DID THAT WORK WORK NOT WORKING IN THIS CASE. SO AS I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY WE REACHED OUT TO OUR COUNTY MANAGER. CLOWN LEFT MESSAGES AND SENT A FEW EMAILS. ON DURING THAT TIME ALRIGHTY OFFICER WENT THROUGH THE THE SAME CUSTOMER SERVICE LINE THERE THAT YOU WOULD -- FOR YOUR PROVIDER AND I'M WORKS THROUGH THE CALL CENTRE WAS ABLE TO REACH A TECHNICIAN. WHO SWITCHED US TO A SLIGHTLY HIGHER PLAN WHICH ALLEVIATED THE THRONG ONLY THROTTLING ALTHOUGH BRIEFLY [inaudible] ON THE NEXT DAY I BELIEVE WE'RE ABLE TO GET AHOLD OF THE ACCOUNTS MANAGER -- WE'RE DIRECTED BACK TO COME TIME WE ALREADY HAD A NEW SERVICE PROVIDER OVERNIGHT SHIP TO AND WAS UP AND RUNNING ON THE UNIT. AND SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE RAT -- YOU KNOW WE'RE ALL USED TO CALLING EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBERS WAR NOW DOING. CHATS ONLINE ON A WEBSITE EIGHT WITH SOMEONE THAT WE DON'T KNOW WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHERE THEY'RE LOCATED WE DON'T KNOW THEIR HIERARCHY IN AN ORGANIZATIONAL -- STRUCTURE. WHAT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH VERIZON AND YOU'VE BEEN SOLD PLANS FOR HUNDREDS OF -- DATA USING UNITS WHAT IS THAT SALES CYCLE LIKE AND DO YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE DOING THIS WORK WITH THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REP THAT YOU'VE WORKED WITH OVER TIME. I DON'T EXPECT TO THE SERVICE CYCLE ALONE. BUT OUR IT STAFF DOES DEVELOP A RELATIONSHIP -- WITH THAT REPRESENTATIVE AND WE WORK VERY HARD. WITH THE VARIOUS. THE VARIOUS COMPANIES THAT WE HAVE CONTRACTS WITH WHETHER IT BE APPLICATION -- SOFTWARE APPLICATION FOR UNITS OR IN THIS CASE -- INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER TO TO COME WITH THE BEST SOLUTION FOR OUR NEEDS AND SO YES IT IS ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS AND BUILD NOT STRONG RELATIONSHIPS SO THAT THEY KNOW YOUR BUSINESS AND CAN TALK PROVIDE YOU GUIDANCE BECAUSE OF FOR ME IS A FIRE CHIEF I CAN TELL YOU. HOW TO OPERATE A FIRE DEPARTMENT? BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW TO RUN AN INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER. AND WE TALKED BRIEFLY LAST NIGHT ABOUT HOW ONE OF YOUR UNITS COULD RUN UP EASILY A THOUSAND DOLLAR BILL IN A MONTH BECAUSE OF THE DATA THAT YOU'RE USING. AND YOU'VE GOT HUNDREDS OF UNITS SO YOU'RE YOUR BILL FOR VERIZON IS EASILY IN THE SIX FIGURES WHAT WOULD THAT BE I DON'T ASK YOU TO COME WITH A NUMBER FOR THAT ONE OF THE ON THE SPOT WOULD THAT BE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF WHAT YOUR VERIZON DELICIOUS. I THINK THAT MY MIND'S ONLY SLIGHTLY LESS THAN. I THINK THAT WAS IN THE CONTEXT OF TOWARDS THE END OF THIS A BET THE LAST DATA PLAN THAT WE WERE -- OFFERED -- WHICH WAS -- NINETY NINE DOLLARS A MONTH PLUS A PER GIGABYTE CHARGE -- AND BASED ON USAGE THAT WE'RE SEEING THAT ONE UNIT ALONG WOULD BE ABOUT A THOUSAND DOLLARS -- SO AGAIN YOU'RE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO FIND THAT BALANCE BECAUSE THIS MONTH IT WOULD BE INCREDIBLY HIGH. NEXT MONTH GOD WILLING. WE HAVE THE FIRES DIED DOWN. AND WE DON'T NEED THE DATA USAGE BUT DO YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARED FOR THOSE SPIKES -- AND JUST ACT I THINK YOU ANSWERED THIS BUT STILL I WANT TO PUSH A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THIS. YOU'VE A VERY LARGE BILL WITH THIS COMPANY AND THE OF A LOT OF UNITS THAT. PART BUT YOU KNOW HOW A SERVICE PLAN FROM FROM VERIZON DO YOU HAVE ONE POINT OF CONTACT AT VERIZON IS THERE SOMEONE THAT YOU HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH. THAT WHEN YOU HAVE -- CONCERNS COMPLAINTS DATA PLAN CHANGES THAT YOU GO TO TO SERVICE THIS ACCOUNT. WE TYPICALLY HAVE ONE POINT OF CONTACT AND AND THAT WOULD BE OUR ACCOUNTS MANAGER. AND HOW LONG IS THAT ACCOUNTS MANAGER BEEN YOUR POINT OF CONTACT I WOULD HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT ACCOUNTS I'M SORT OF CHINA SPOT ABOUT THAT WHEN. I IF IT ANY OTHER FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS ON THAT -- ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU GUYS LIKE TO SAY WHILE YOU'RE HERE I I JUST LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU FOR HEARING US TODAY. AS WITH THE ANY AGENCY WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING BACK TO THE TASK AT HAND AND THAT SERVING. OUR CITIZENS AND I APPRECIATE YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS AS WE WORK TOWARDS GOD RESOLUTION SO THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN TO ANOTHER FIRE AIDS. I THINK THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING HERE AND SHARING THIS TESTIMONY YOUR WIFE WAS 1100% CORRECT WHEN NIGHT SHE SAID THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO TELL THE STORY. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO SAY THIS WEEK WE DON'T KNOW HOW HOW MANY OTHER TIMES THIS HAS OCCURRED AND DIED AND AND OF COURSE IT'S ACTUALLY DID OCCUR TO YOU BRIEFLY. I IN A PRIOR EVENT LIGHT SIDE BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE KNOW ABOUT THAT'S GOING TO MAKE SURE IT NEVER OCCURS AGAIN. AND WE NEED TO WORK WITH SIDE WITH THOSE WHO ARE PROVIDING SERVICES TO OUR FIRST RESPONDERS TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE'VE GOT TIED THE BEST RESPONSE POSSIBLE YOU CAN DO IT ALONE AND DIE AND WE'RE ON THE SAME TEAM AND I I HOPE -- YOU KNOW IT FROM THE PROVIDER'S PERSPECTIVE THEY FEEL THE SAME WAY. THANK YOU ALL FIGURE.

IF THAT'S ALRIGHT WITH THE CHAIR PERFECT THANK YOU THANK YOU. SO THIS STATEMENT WAS ISSUED THIS MORNING BY* SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF PUBLIC SECTOR MIGHT MARIANA. FIRST STATE FIRST RESPONDERS PUT THEMSELVES ON THE LINE EACH AND EVERY DAY. AND EVERY DAY WE ARE ETERNALLY GRATEFUL FOR THEIR BRAVERY AND EFFORTS. IN SUPPORTING FIRST RESPONDERS IN THE MENDOCINO FIRE WE DID NOT LIVE UP TO OUR OWN PROMISE OF SERVICE AND PERFORMANCE EXCELLENCE WHEN OUR PROCESS FAILED SOME FIRST RESPONDERS ON THE LINE. BATTLING A MASSIVE CALIFORNIA WILDFIRE. FOR THAT WE ARE TRULY SORRY. AND WE'RE MAKING EVERY EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT IT NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN. AS OF YESTERDAY WE REMOVED ALL SPEED CAP RESTRICTIONS FOR FIRST RESPONDERS ON THE WEST COAST AND IN HAWAII. TO SUPPORT CURRENT FIGHTER FIREFIGHTING AND HURRICANE LANE EFFORTS. FURTHER. IN THE EVENT OF ANOTHER DISASTER VERIZON WILL LIFT RESTRICTIONS ON PUBLIC SAFETY CUSTOMERS PROVIDING FULL NETWORK ACCESS. WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH MISSION CRITICAL FIRST RESPONDERS TO REFINE OUR SERVICE PLAN TO BETTER MEET THEIR UNIQUE NEEDS. AS A RESULT WE'RE INTRODUCING A NEW PLAN THAT WILL FEATURE UNLIMITED DATA WITH NO CAPS ON MOBILE SOLUTIONS AND AUTOMATICALLY INCLUDES PRIORITY ACCESS. WILL PROVIDE FULL DETAILS WHEN WE INTRODUCED THE PLAN NEXT WEEK. AND WE'LL MAKE IT EASY TO UPGRADE SERVICE AT NO ADDITIONAL COST. VERIZON HAS LONG BEEN KNOWN AS THE TRUSTED PROVIDER OF CHOICE. FOR PUBLIC SAFETY BECAUSE OF OUR SUPERIOR NETWORK RELIABILITY AND OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL FIRST RESPONDERS IN TIMES OF CRISIS. VERIZON CUSTOMERS HAVE ACCESS TO OUR MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND SQUARE MILE FOUR G. LTE COVERAGE ADVANTAGE OVER COMPETITORS. IN ADDITION WE CONSISTENTLY SHOW UP IN TIMES OF DISASTER TO EXTEND OUR NETWORK CAPABILITIES PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH LONER DEVICES AND PROVIDE CUSTOMERS OF ANY PROVIDER. WITH ACCESS TO FREE CHARGING STATIONS WE ARE PROUD TO SUPPORT THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVICE ALL. ON A PERSONAL NOTE -- IF I MAY ADD -- AS A FIFTEEN YEAR VETERAN FOR THE COMPANY -- WE ALL MISS WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES FROM TIME TO TIME. THE TRUE MEASURE OF LEADERSHIP. IS HOW QUICKLY WE ADMIT IT OWN IT. AND MAKE IT RIGHT. I AM PROUD TO STAND BY THE STATEMENT I JUST READ TO YOU. AND I AM I HERE TO INTRODUCE -- MISTER DAVE HICKEY WHO IS OUR VICE PRESIDENT OF OF BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT SALES. WHO WILL ELABORATE FURTHER ON THE SITUATION AT HAND HOW IT HAPPENED AND HOW AND WHAT WE HAVE DONE WHAT IMMEDIATE ACTION WE'VE TAKEN TO ADDRESS THE SITUATION AT HAND? TO HIS RIGHT IS -- DIRECTOR WESTERN IN SHAW. OTHER OF BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT SALES IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. YEAH THANK YOU MISTER A. S. AND OUT. AYE I WANT TO JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE PERSONAL NOTE THAT YOU MADE -- YOU'RE HAVING KNOWN YOU AND AND OTHER PEOPLE THAT THAT WORK FOR VERIZON -- I KNOW THAT IT'S CALIFORNIANS YOU MUST OF BEEN IS AGHAST AS ANYBODY AND YOU SO I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT COME UP HERE -- TO ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT HAD OCCURRED TO EXPRESS THE CONTRITION THAT YOU HAVE EXPRESSED THAT THE CORPORATION HAS EXPRESSED AS WELL. AND SO IT'S SAD IT'S IT'S BRAVE OF YOU AND AND I'M I'M GRATEFUL THAT YOU GUYS ARE HERE TO TELL YOUR STORY AS WELL AND DIED IN AND HELP US LEARN AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE FROM IT MISTER ICKE. YEAH SO THANK YOU APPRECIATE THE TIME -- AN ECHO MANY OF THE STATEMENTS THAT YOU'VE SAT AND WE'VE HEARD FROM THE OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- THROUGHOUT THIS MORNING -- YOU LIKE TO GO ON A LITTLE DETAIL WHAT HAPPENED. DEBT PLEASE THANK YOU PERFECT SO -- AS WE TAKE A STEP BACK AND LISTEN TO WHAT WE WERE GOING THROUGH -- AND LISTEN TO TO CHEAP OUT AND GO THROUGH HIS -- EVENTS OF THE PROCESS -- IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT WE'RE HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THIS PART OF THE PROCESS INSTEAD OF TALKING ABOUT PARTNERSHIP OF PUBLIC SAFETY -- I WILL TELL YOU AS A IT WE TOOK A STEP. I'M AND I THINK YOU HEARD IT FROM THE CHIEF THAT THERE'S OCCURRENCES WHERE WE'RE REALLY FAST FORUM IN THIS OCCURRENCE WHERE WENT SLOW -- AYE ARE MISTAKEN I WOULD SAY FROM A LEADERSHIP STANDPOINT I THINK YOU'RE THAT FROM THE STATEMENT IS THAT YOU KNOW WE TAKE FULL OWNERSHIP AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THAT I PERSONALLY DO AS WELL. AND THE MISTAKE REALLY COMES DOWN TO WE HAVE HUMAN INTERACTION INTERVENTION THAT WAS REQUIRED IN THE PROCESS -- AND WE ON THAT AND IT REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SYSTEM WIDE AUTOMATIC STEP THAT WAS ABLE TO BE ABLE -- TO TO BE DONE WHEN WE CALL SPEED CAPPER IN THE IN THE MEDIA SCOTT THROTTLING AS WELL. SO I THINK WHAT YOU'VE HEARD IS THAT WE'VE TAKEN STEPS TO MOVE FOR REMOVED THROUGH -- SPEAK CAPPING FROM FIRST RESPONDER LINES -- THIS WEEK WHICH IS GREAT FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE -- FIGHTING THE FIRES AND OTHER -- INCIDENCES THAT ARE HAPPENING WHO I THE OTHER THING THAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE TAKEN STEPS FORWARD ON THEIR THE CALIFORNIA CONTRACT AND OTHERS TO PUT A PLAN IN PLACE AT NO ADDITIONAL COST. THAT ALLEVIATE THIS CONCERN GOING FORWARD FOR FIRST RESPONDERS THERE WON'T BE A DATA CAP THAT'S ON THAT PLAN -- FROM A RESTRICTIONS STANDPOINT I THINK THAT IN ITSELF IS A MOVE FOR THE SECOND THING WE INTRODUCED EARLIER THIS YEAR OUR PRIORITY IN PREEMPTION PRODUCTS ON SMARTPHONES AND SO NOW WHAT CAN THIS MOBILE BROADBAND -- PRODUCT THAT THE CHIEF WAS REFER. AND NOW HAVE PRIMARY ACCESS AS WELL WHEN YOU GET INTO A CONGESTED NETWORK THOSE THINGS ALONE I THINK WILL HELP US MOVE IN TO THE RIGHT. ARRANGEMENT WITH FIRST RESPONDERS SO THEY CAN DO THEIR JOB AND CONTINUE TO STAY SAFE. I'M I WOULD ALSO ADDRESS THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARDS MAKING SURE. HOW WE HAVE DEDICATED INDIVIDUALS ON THE TEAMS AND THEY UNDERSTAND HOW TO UTILIZE THE SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES THAT WE HAVE TODAY WE HAVE A DEDICATED ORGANIZATION? THAT IS A REFINED JUST DOWN TO HANDLING GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL WHICH IS WHAT -- THE CHIEF WAS ABLE TO RELY ON WHEN HE WAS A CALLED INTO ONE OF OUR CALL CENTERS SO THEY'RE TRAINED THEY GO THROUGH A HEAVY EXTENSIVE PROCESSING MONTHLY. TO BE ABLE TO GO AND AND TAKE CARE OF OUR CUSTOMERS ON AN OPERATIONAL BASIS AS WELL AND THEN -- WEST TO MY RIGHT HERE HE ALSO HELPS HANDLE OUR TEAMS HERE LOCALLY -- IN THE CALIFORNIA MARKET FROM A GOVERNMENT PERSPECTIVE ACTUALLY HANDLES THE WHOLE WEST COAST AND THEN WE HAVE DEDICATED ACCOUNT REPRESENTATIVES THAT WORK JUST SOLELY ON GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTS I KNOW YOU ASKED THAT EARLIER HOW THAT RELATIONSHIP IS. AND THAT'S REALLY WHERE -- THOSE CUSTOMERS ARE THERE I MEAN THOSE REPRESENTATIVES ARE THERE TO WORK WITH CUSTOMERS IN IT NOW ON BE AYE CUSTOM AND BASIC SOLUTIONS THAT THEY MAY NEED AS YOU HEARD I THINK FROM OTHER MEN. A CALL TO EASE OF WHAT THEY MAY FACE IN CHALLENGES ARE DIFFERENT. SO THOSE ARE KIND OF SOME OF THE AREAS A AND WHAT'S I WOULD SAY IS WHAT WE TO WHAT HAPPENED. AND WHERE WE'VE TAKEN STEPS TO MOVE FORWARD SO THAT IS NOT AN OCCURRENCE GOING FORWARD. BUT IF YOU MISTER HICKEY MISTER SHORTAGE OF ANY COMMENTS. GREAT THANK YOU. MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS AT THIS POINT. IF I WERE CREE. HELLO I'M AS I SAID BEFORE TO THE A PLUS GROUP IN RETROSPECT IT MOVED INTO DIFFERENT. I WOULD HAVE NOT HAD A SYSTEM IN PLACE THERE REQUIRED -- OF RAPPER IN INTERACTION TO REMOVE SOMETHING OFF OF ALIGNMENT EFFORTS FROM FIRST RESPONDERS IN THE MIDDLE OF A CRISIS THAT WILL IT'S A LOT LAST THING THEY SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT. IS THERE I WOULD HAVE HAD A SYSTEM IN PLACE THAT AND AUTOMATICALLY I UTILIZED IT WHICH I THINK THE NEW PLANTS DO THAT FORCE NOW IS OUR SYSTEM THAT IN WHICH OF A FLAG ALERTS THE A CLIENT SERVICE REP THAT. YEAH WE MERGED CEILING NEED TO MAKE SURE ALL LINES ARE CLEAR. AND WHERE ARE YOU ALL RIGHT WHERE YOU ACTUALLY AWARE OF ALL THE DATA. THAT THE FIRE AND OUR FIRST RESPONERS HAVE. IN THE BACK OF THEIR CARS THEY'VE GOT SO MANY COMPUTERS AND ALL THE STATE OF THIS GOING ON AND I THINK A LOT OF US IN LOT OF IT'S HAVE NO IDEA. ALL THE DATA THAT IS NEEDED DURING SPIRES AND TO SUPPRESS THE FIRES AND MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE -- ARM OF MUTUAL AID IN THE RIGHT PLACES THE RIGHT TIMES AND SO I THINK -- I ALSO MAKE SURE THAT THE DATA CAN CONTINUE TO FLOW BECAUSE THAT'S A LOT OF DATA. AND IN ITS REALLY EASY TO SAY YEAH Y. FLIP THE SWITCHES TO GO BUT ARE YOU REALLY READY TO TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS AND CAN OUR FIREFIGHTERS ACCESS THAT IDEA. THE IF I MAY SIR GREAT GREAT QUESTION -- I THINK PRETTY SAID IT PASSED EARLIER WE HAVE A LONG STANDING HISTORY OF WORKING WITH PUBLIC SAFETY WHAT THAT IS THE ADVANTAGE THAT IS GIVEN US. AS WE UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE FRONTLINE AND SO WE HAVE A TEAM OF THESE THIRTEEN THAT GOES OUT AND WORK SIDE BY SIDE WITH THESE INDIVIDUALS. I'M I HAVE SOME I THINK THIS AS SHE COULD BE POTENTIALLY IN YOUR BINDERS AS WELL AS THERE'S MANY THINGS IN WHICH WE'VE DEPLOYED NOW JUST GIVE YOU AN IDEA MAYBE ELABORATE WHEN YOU SAY EQUIPMENT -- ON IT SO -- THEY HAVE EVERYTHING FROM -- MOBILE PHONES AND TABLETS AND AND ROUTERS IN PLACE AND SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT AND AND THEN OFTEN THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN RURAL SITUATIONS WHERE THEY NEED ADDITIONAL COVERAGE WE WILL ROLL OUT -- CALVIN COLDS THOSE ARE PRETTY MUCH BRINGING OUT A CELL TOWER ON WHALES IN BEING ABLE TO DEPLOY THOSE FOR YOU AS WELL I WILL TELL YOU IN THE MENDOCINO COMPLEX FIRE. WE AT THIRTY EIGHT SITES THAT WERE IMPACT 7% CELL SITE AVAILABILITY -- WITHIN THAT FOR THE FOURTEEN DAYS WE'VE HAD A HUNDRED PER HOW IS WE REALLY TOOK I THINK IT WAS THE QUESTION EARLIER ABOUT WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO HELP. PREVENT CELL SITES FROM -- FACING DESTRUCTION SO WE REALLY TAKE PRIDE IN THE WAY WE MANAGE OUR NETWORK FROM THAT STANDPOINT AS WELL -- I WOULD ALSO TELL YOU THAT WE HAVE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ON THE GROUND THAT ARE DELIVERING ON EVERYTHING FROM CELLPHONES ROUTERS HOT SPOTS INTERNET CONNECTED LAPTOPS. CHARGING STATIONS RAP -- FOR THE RED CROSS STATIONS AS WELL HELPING THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN EVACUATED IN PROVIDING THEM CAN ACTIVITY SO WE'VE ADDED CAPACITY TO SITES AS WE SEE THEM FIT WITHIN THOSE RANGES SO AS AN INCIDENT HAPPENS. WE WILL DIRECT TRAFFIC OR DIRECT CAPACITY TO THOSE SITES WHERE NEEDED ARE AT AS LONG AS THE SITUATION ARISES SO I THINK THAT'S THAT'S A WAYS FROM WHERE WE STAND WE TRY TO GET PROACTIVELY AHEAD OF IT. SO AS YOU CAN IMAGINE I'VE BEEN NUMEROUS FIRES THE PAST. THREE YEARS YEAH. AND I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT TO BRING OUT THE MOBILE -- THE RISE IN CELLS YOU KNOW SITTING RIGHT. UNFORTUNATE SOMETIMES THEY SIT THERE FOR A COUPLE DAYS BEFORE SOMEONE'S ACTUALLY AFTER TO ACTIVATE HIM. SO I WOULD JUST SUGGEST THAT WE MAKE SURE HAVE THAT -- THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL -- AND THEN THE OTHER THING IS I ALWAYS HAVE TO GO BACK FROM EVERYBODY IN THE BUILDING KNOWS I'M I'M FROM A RURAL AREA. AND I APPLAUD YOU FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY BUT I WANT YOU TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE RURAL AREAS BECAUSE THEIR VOICE IS NOT NECESSARY HEARD THEY DON'T HAVE THE EXPERTISE NECESSARY HELP IMPLEMENT AND GET GRANTS TO GET. SOME OF THE FUNDING TO DO SOME OF THESE THINGS AND UNFORTUNATELY RIGHT NOW WHERE WE HAVE THE CAMPFIRES FARTHER RURAL AREAS NOT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN OR URBAN AREAS BUT KEEP THAT IN MIND AS AS WE MOVE FORWARD. AND I APPRECIATE THE MOMENTUM IN THAT WITH THE LETTER TODAY AND WHAT YOU PLAN ON DOING -- BUT WE ALWAYS CAN IMPROVE AND SO WHAT WE DO TODAY -- I'M HOPING THAT MAYBE IN SIX MONTHS SO WE CAN REVIEW IT WHAT WORKED WHAT DIDN'T WORK SUB THANK YOU VERY LACKEY MISTER RODRIGUEZ. YES ALSO ARE RUDY ON A THANK YOU FOR READING THAT STATEMENT AND RICE AND TAKING THE QUICK ON A SHIP IN ADDRESSING IT MERELY THAT THE ISSUE THAT OCCURRED IN THE FIRE -- SO THANK YOU FOR RIGHTS AND FOR IMMEDIATELY WORKING OUT ON A FIX TO THE SOLUTION. I JUST HAVE TWO QUESTIONS -- WE TALKED ABOUT SOME ISSUES WHEN THEY TALKED ABOUT. TRYING TO GET A HOLD OF SOMEBODY TO UP THE PLANET SHE WITH ISSUES SO. MORE ARE THERE CALL CENTERS LOCATED FOR THEM FIRST RESPONDERS ARE THEY LOCATED. HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND ARE THEY REALLY EASY ACCESSIBLE. I THINK YOU SAID YOU HAVE DEDICATED PERSONNEL SO. ONE QUESTION IS WHERE THEY LOCATED IN THE REALLY EASY ACCESSIBLE TO THEM. TWENTY FOUR HOURS SEVEN DAYS A WEEK JUST LIKE THEY WORK TWENTY FOUR HOURS SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. FOR ONE AND FOR TWO OF THE CHIEF TALKED ABOUT THIS WAS LOOKS LIKE THAT THIRD TIME. THERE IS AN ISSUE WHY WASN'T ANYTHING REALLY LOOKED AT THE FIRST TIME WORKING WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN AGAIN SO THE ONLY TO QUESTION THAT GREAT AYE. SO WE DO HAVE CALL CENTERS -- ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT ARE DE DESIGNATED -- SEPARATELY FROM CONSUMER AND BUSINESS AND THEY'RE TRAINED ON HOW TO TAKE CARE OF CUSTOMERS -- AS WELL WHICH IS HOW THE THAT THE OCCURRENCE WHERE THAT YOU SPOKE ABOUT THE TWENTY MINUTES AND BEING ABLE TO MOVE HE'D I WORKED THROUGH ONE OF THOSE CENTERS. AND A WRAP. OF REPRESENTATIVES UP THERE THAT DEAL WITH I WOULD SAY MORE OF THESE ISSUES OF A FREQUENTLY THE OTHER PART OF THAT SUPPORT COMES FROM WE HAVE LOCAL MAJOR ACCOUNT MANAGERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THAT ARE ASSIGNED SPECIFIC -- EITHER BASED ON OUR BEING ABLE TO SUPPORT THAT TERRITORY AS WELL AND THEN THEY BECOME THAT -- THE NAME IN THE FACE OF A VERIZON AND WORK THROUGH WHETHER THAT BE SERVICE ISSUES AND ALSO TAKING CARE OF ME OUR FUTURE SOLUTIONS SO THAT'S KIND OF HOW THAT THAT THE SERVICE -- SIDE OF IT -- WORKS AS WELL THE SECOND PART OF YOUR QUESTION WAS THE CHIEF ELABORATE ELABORATED ABOUT AN INCIDENT DECEMBER ó AFFRONT TO GO ABOUT. IT YEAH BROADLY NEW ISSUES I'M JUST PERSON HOW COME THERE WAS AND MAYBE A MORE -- EAGER RESPONSE TO TAKE CARE THAT THEN. YEAH AT THAT TIME THERE ARE NOW VALID QUESTION FOR SURE AS WELL I I WOULD TELL YOU THAT. THAT THE PLAN AND WATCHED -- THE CHIEF AND OTHERS HAVE REFERRED -- TO THAT WAS THAT I WOULD SAY THAT WAS THE OPTION ON IT WAS IN A POLICY THAT WAS JUST PART OF THAT PRICE PLAN. AND THEN IN INCIDENTS WHICH WE GOT TALKED ABOUT -- LIKE THE CHIEF OCCURRED THAT THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE REMOVED IF I GO BACK TO WHAT I EARLIER SAID THERE WAS AN OPERATIONAL AIR -- AND AND YOU KNOW WE WE FELT ON THAT PART OF IT AND IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN REMOVED ACT GOING FORWARD -- IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT OF THAT LIKE THIS BRINGS US TOGETHER BUT I THINK THAT THE FACT THAT MATTER I THINK IT -- THE RESOLUTION IS GOING TO HELP EVERYBODY ELSE -- AS WE GO FORWARD IN THAT AND I THINK THAT'S THANK YOU YEAH. IT'S WALDRON. THANK YOU HOME JUST FOR CLARIFICATION SO -- THE PUBLIC SAFETY ACCOUNTS WILL. ALWAYS HAVE THE CAP LIVED IF THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO ON AN INCIDENT BY INCIDENT FISHER OKAY YES FIRST FIRST RESPONDERS FOR FIRST RESPONDERS WILL HAVE THAT CAP REMAIN IS REMOVED AND IT'S ALREADY REMEMBER RIGHT NOW AND THEN THE THE NEW PLAN WILL BE IN PLACE NEXT WEEK AS IT. GETS SICK KNOWLEDGE STE ARE BY EACH AGENCY. OKAY AND THEN -- JUST TO COME FOLLOW UP WITH THEM WHAT MISS AGUIAR-CURRY WAS SAYING -- AND YOU KNOW IT'S A RELATIVE ALL OVER THE STATE IN A LOT OF OUR DISTRICTS. WITH REMOTE BACKCOUNTRY AIR TRIBAL LANDS. M. THEY ALSO HAVE THEIR OWN PUBLIC SAFETY NOW SOME OF THEM NOT ALL OF THEM SOME OF THEM ARE VERY REMOTE -- TRYING TO GET ACCESS INTO THEIR IS CRITICAL AS IT IS -- HOW DO YOU DRESS THAT YOU STILL HAVE THE SAME TYPES OF AGREEMENTS WITH THE TRIBAL -- DIFFERENT PUBLIC SAFETY GROUPS AS WELL. SO WE WE HAVE A AS YOU MY REALIZE AT THAT THE COMPANY OF OUR SIZE WE HAVE A DEDICATED NETWORK ORGANIZATION. AND THEY'RE REALLY OUT AND TASK WITH A FEW THINGS THAT ONE IS ENSURING THE COVERAGE THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE HAS CAPACITY TO HANDLE THE TRAFFIC. A AND THOSE THAT ARE USING THE AND FUTURE PROOF IT AS WELL THE OTHER PART OF THAT IS LOOKING FOR AREAS -- TO WHERE WE CAN IMPROVE COVERAGE AND PROVIDE THAT -- FOR THE POPULATION THAT MAYBE DEMAND YOU KNOW THAT AS WELL AS WE CONTINUE TO ROLL THROUGH -- MANY CYCLES OF THAT AND AND AND GROW IN AND I THINK RUDY SAID EARLIER -- I THINK IT'S ONE THING -- YOU COULD PROBABLY SURVEY MOST VERIZON CUSTOMERS OUT THERE AS WELL WE DO PRIDE OR SELF FROM A NETWORK STANDPOINT. OF FOREIGN -- FIFTY THOUSAND STE. THAT'S NOT A PROCESS THAT HAPPENED OVERNIGHT AND TOOK SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT FOR US TO TELL HIM AND I AND I GIVE YOU OUR COMMITMENT THAT'S SOMETHING WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON AS WE DO I WOULD SAY YOUR ACCOUNT REPRESENTATIVES. TO THEY'VE THEY BRING THOSE ARM THOSE AREAS OF CONCERN WHETHER BE LACK OF COVERAGE OR CAPACITY UP THROUGH US IN THE MEANWHILE THAT THROUGH OUR NETWORK PROTOCOL. THANK YOU ENDS YEARS WAS ONE OF THE NETWORKS THAT WAS WORKING IN THE FALL RIVER FIRE THANK YOU. BUT OBVIOUSLY NOT. I THINK YOU -- YOU KNOW BUT WE'RE HERE DEFINITE HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THE SPECIFIC ISSUE AND IT'S BEEN MENTIONED THAT -- IT'S WE KNOW BEEN. THREE INCIDENTS BUT IN THINKING MORE OF WAYS -- THAT WOULD HELP US MOVE FORWARD THAT WOULD. ALSO LOOK BEYOND THE INCIDENT THAT WE'RE HERE TO DISCUSS BUT CAN YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT VERIZON TYPICALLY. A WHAT ACTIVITIES REYES AND TYPICALLY ENGAGES IN WHEN PRESENTED WITH. WILDFIRE SITUATIONS IN CALIFORNIA AND DOES IT VERY REGION TO REGION COUNTY TO COUNTY BUT WHAT ARE WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU TYPICALLY ENGAGE A YEAH IT A GREAT GREAT QUESTION -- I WOULD SAY STEMS BACK TO A FEW AREAS WINE AT THINK IT STARTS WITH THE PARTNERSHIP THAT WE WOULD HAVE WITH THE AGENCIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA -- FOR INSTANCE AND UNDERSTANDING THE SIGNIFICANT NEED FOR SERVICES OUTSIDE OF I WOULD SAY STANDARD PROTOCOL AS WELL AND SO WE HAVE -- WE HAVE AN ENGINEER ON THEIR NETWORK SIDE THIS IT'S AND EMERGENCY OFFICE AS WELL WHILE CRISIS IS ARE GOING THRU SO U. S. THERE WHICH IS I. HELPS US TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE NEED TO DEPLOY -- AND THEN WE HAVE OF THESE THIRTEEN THAT'S DE. FOR INDIA THAT HAS -- VEHICLES AND TRAILERS AND THINGS SET UP THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO DEPLOY IT NOT ONLY NETWORK RESOURCES BUT ALSO QUITMAN LAPTOPS AND PEOPLE. OUGHT TO BE ABLE -- TO HELP IN AND OUT THROUGH THE WILD FIRES AS WELL AND THEN AS INCIDENTS HAPPEN -- AS GO FORWARD WE LOOK AT REDIRECTING ARE MAKING SURE WE HAVE THE CAPACITY AT THE SITE AND THEN -- ENSURING THAT THE RIGHT -- THE RIGHT PROCESSES ARE ABLE TO FOLLOW IN AND FORTUNE LIKE IN THIS INCIDENT -- ALONE AND THAT PROCESS WAS NOT ABLE TO BE FOLLOWED BECAUSE OF I THINK THE HUMAN SIDE OF AND AND AND WE'VE NOW TAKEN THAT PIECE OUT. I TO MAKE IT A SYSTEM WIDE EYES STANDPOINT SO THAT FIRST RESPONDER DOES NOT NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU AND ADDITIONALLY YOU'VE A VIEW RELEASED A STATEMENT NOT JUST THAT YOU YOU HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO US TODAY BUT THE RELEASED THE PUBLIC ABOUT YOUR WORK. MOVING FORWARD THAT CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT -- OR MAYBE GIVE US A TEASER ABOUT WHAT THAT PLAN THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IN THIS STATEMENT MY INCLUDE. ABSOLUTELY YET SO -- FOR THAT SHE FOR INSTANCE IS ON A AT THE KEY REFERENCE TO THIRTY SEVEN NINETY NINE PLAN THAT HE WAS CURRENTLY ON THAT PLAN RATE WISE WILL STAY THE SAME WHAT HE WILL GET NOW IS THE AT FULL ACCESS TO OUR NETWORK WITH NO SPEED CAPS. AND THEN THE LAB DATA PRIORITY ACCESS AS WELL WHICH IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ON THE ENVIRONMENT FOR PUBLIC SAFETY AS NETWORKS BECOME CONGESTED IN A CRISIS EVENT. ON THAT THEY WILL HAVE -- THAT BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH THERE AND AND BE ABLE TO LEAVE UTILIZE IT AT THE RIGHT SPEED. SO THAT'S WHAT THAT AT THAT PLAN WILL HELP US IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE DID BACK EARLIER IN APRIL AROUND SMARTPHONES ME THANK YOU AND I WANNA ECHO I THINK WHAT. WE'VE HEARD I'M FROM ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUES IS THAT -- THE ISSUES ABSOLUTELY WORRY ES UM AND WE WANT TO TRY TO FIND A WAY AND THAT WE CAN WORK IN PARTNERSHIP -- BUT I ALSO HOPE AND AND IN WHILE. YOU LIAM AS RISE IN ARE THE FOCUS TODAY THAT THIS CONVERSATION IS NOT UNDERSTOOD AS JUST LIMITED I'M TO VERIZON BUT REALLY ABOUT. IF WE'RE MOVING FORWARD HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD I'M IN A DIFFERENT WAY I'M REALLY WITH ALL OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS BECAUSE IT SOUNDED TO ME THAT WHILE THERE WERE MISTAKES IT WAS ALSO VERY EVIDENT. THAT OUR PUBLIC SAFETY CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT THE PRODUCTS AND SO THAT IS PART OF THE NECESSITY TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MOVE FORWARD -- I KNOW IT'S ALSO VERY COMPLICATED ON AUGUST NINTH -- I WAS IN LASSEN COUNTY AND I GOT EVACUATED ON FOR A FIRE. AYE AND IF THERE WAS A MOMENT WHERE I HAD. MY SON WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT WAS WORKING AND MULTIPLE PEOPLE WERE FIRING THE PHONE AND IT HAPPENED TO BE THAT I'M I AM A CUSTOMER OF YOURS. SO IT'S COMPLICATED WE THINGS MIGHT HAVE AND BUT I WOULD REALLY HOPE THAT WHAT COMES OUT OF TODAY IS NOT JUST. A FOCUS ON ONE COMPANY BUT A WAY FOR ALL OF US TO MOVE FORWARD TO SAY THAT FOR EVERY COMPANY TO KNOW THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS IMPORTANT TO S. -- IT IS IS SOMETHING THAT IS OUR NEW NORMAL AS THE GOVERNOR HAS DESCRIBED IT SO WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE NEVER. UMP PUBLIC SAFETY OR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA IN A PLACE -- WHERE THE -- MEAL FOR THOSE MINUTES AND SECONDS COUNT AND THAT COMMUNICATION IS VITAL TO IT AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUICK [inaudible] SPONSORS AND TO THIS SET UP PROBLEM I THINK THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT DOES NOT -- GO UNNOTICED TO THAT THE RESPONSE WAS VERY QUICK TO TRY TO RECTIFY A PROBLEM I KNOW THAT WE CAN'T ALWAYS -- YOU KNOW PLAN. CREATE A LAWLER POLICY. FOR HUMAN ERROR IT'S HARD IT'S REALLY HARD EVEN HAPPENS AMONGST US ON BUT IT IS SO WE HAVE REFEREE. HUNGRY LIKE I PRESSED THE WRONG BUTTON LET ME GO BACK AND FIX IT. AND AND IT'S JUST IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE AGAIN IT'S NOT LIMITED TO YOU BUT WE READ THIS IS. IT WAS IMPORTANT ENOUGH FOR ALL OF US TO BE HERE IN THIS ROOM TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AND TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE MOVE FORWARD. A I DO WELCOME THAT IF THERE ARE ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN OUTSIDE OF THIS PARTICULAR HEARING CONVERSATIONS THAT NOT ONLY INFORM HOW WE MOVE FORWARD BUT THAT MAYBE CHANGE THE WAY WE MOVE FORWARD. AND TO HELP PUBLIC SAFETY I KNOW THAT I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS IF WE HAVE LEARN BEST PRACTICES THAT SHOULD BE EXAMINED THAT SHOULD BE LOOKED AT IN A WAY THAT THIS WILL NOT BE. FIVE OR TEN YEARS WE WANNA KNOW THOSE BECAUSE WE WANT TO KNOW HOW WE REPLICATE THEM ACROSS THE STATE. AND I I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE -- TO YOU KNOW BE EVACUATED NOT JUST IN SANTA BARBARA MATURE COUNTY BUT NOW AND RURAL -- YOU KNOW VERY VERY RURAL -- PART OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S HARDER -- DAY THERE IS. THERE ARE SOME OTHER HARDSHIPS THERE AND SO I THINK THAT AS WE HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS -- I HOPE YOU WILL BE AT THE TABLE IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE GONNA GET TABLE IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE GONNA BE AT THE TABLE ON AND I THINK YOU FOR THAT -- FIT FOR THAT RESPONSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WHEN QUESTIONED EMISSARY HURRY? I JUST AYE CURIOSITY'S SAKE DOES OFF THE ROADS TO SERVICES HAVE ONE MANAGE PLAN THAT THEY CAN WORK WITH YOU ON IT SEEMS TO ME IS THE FOR HAVING A EACH ONE OF THESE INDIVIDUAL. FIRE DEPARTMENTS AND HAVE WILL OFFICE EMERGENCY SERVICES WOULD YOU THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE A CONTRACT. YEAH YOU MAY ALREADY HAVE THAT ARE NEW YES I'VE GOT A GREAT QUESTION SO YOU MAY NOT BE AWARE THAT THAT'S THE STATE NEGOTIATES A CONTRACT THAT HAS. SPECIFIC PLANS THAT ALIGN WITH CERTAIN PRODUCTS SO THAT THAT IS THE SITUATION TODAY THE GREAT THING ABOUT THE NEW PLAN GOING FORWARD ABSOLUTELY -- MAKES THE CHOICE MUCH EASIER POP FOR THAT TYPE OF PLAN BUT SEE IN THIS STATEMENT WHERE YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT LIFTING OF THE CAPS IN THE SPEED RESTRICTIONS FOR FIRE FIGHTING CALIFORNIA. EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY AND FOR HURRICANE LANE IN WHO I THAT WITH THE PLAN THAT YOU'RE. PLANNING ON INTRODUCING NEXT WEEK AND EVEN INCLUSIVE OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING RIGHT NOW. BUT BUT THE PLAN NEXT WEEK IS NOT GOING TO BE NATIONWIDE IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S SPECIFIC AND YOU KNOW THERE ARE WILD FIRES GOING ON ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. ARE BEYOND JUST CALIFORNIA OR THE EXHAUSTION DISASTER IN L. Y. -- THAT THIS COULD APPLY TO AND SO HOW HOW MUCH ARE YOU TAKING THAT NATIONWIDE LOOK DIED AT THIS WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT BITING THIS APPLE AND AND KIND OF FICTION IS NOT ABSOLUTE THIS SO THIS IS A NATIONWIDE -- FIRST RESPONDER POLICY THAT'S GOING INTO EFFECT. AND AND SO THAT THE PLAN WOULD APPLY THAT WAY. SO ACT FRIENDLY SWINGS WILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH THEIR THEIR CONTRACT VEHICLE AND ACKNOWLEDGE BUT AS SOON AS THEY DO THAT THEY'LL BE ABLE TO MOVE OVER TO THAT. SO YOU GOT A LOOK AT THE CONTRACT VEHICLE TO UNDERSTAND WHO YOUR ACCOUNT IS WITH SO HOW CERTAIN ARE YOU THAT YOU KNOW WHO ARE YOUR FIRST RESPONDER. ACCOUNTS ARE YET SO I THOUGHT WE HAVE THE IDENTIFIED THROUGH -- A TWO IT'S CALLED MAX CODES IN THESE CODES IDENTIFY WHO FIRST RESPONDERS ARE AND THAT'S WHAT OUR SYSTEM UTILIZES I'VE TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN GO THROUGH AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE PUT ON THOSE RIGHT PLANS ARE GOING FOR IT AND THAT'S ACROSS THE ENTIRE NATION. AND AND SO YOU'VE GOT THIS IDENTIFIER IT TELLS YOU WHO YOUR CUSTOMER IS. DEED I MEAN I AGAIN I I HATE PUTTING PEOPLE ON THE SPOT I MEAN YOU KNOW HOW MANY OF OF THOSE ARE IN CALIFORNIA TODAY ONE IN. THE NUMBER OF ACCOUNTS BUT THEN THE NUMBER OF DEVICES THAT THIS CHANGE WOULD BE AFFECTING. ARM AND IT'S IT'S YOU KNOW I'M TEMPTED. WE PUBLIC I SOUNDS LIKE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DEVICES AT THE LEAST AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS YOU KNOW IF YOU STARTING ABOUT. HOW MANY AGENCIES WE HAVE IN THE STATE BOTH ON FIRE FIGHTING BUT LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT OUR EMERGENCY RESPONDERS ALL AGENTS IN CALIFORNIA [inaudible] PLUS PUB. FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND RANGE OKAY BETH THANK YOU PUBLIC SAFETY IS AS A PERSON OKAY. I'M WHEN YOU WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT -- AT THIS SPEED RESTRICTIONS SO YOU GOT THE SPEED CAP [inaudible] A TERM THAT I THINK IS. EASIER TO UNDERSTAND AND THROTTLING -- THAT. YOU ALSO MENTIONED THAT THEY WOULD BE GETTING THE BEST TRAFFIC. WHICH TO ME SOUNDS LIKE OP PRIORITIZATION OF THE TRAFFIC FOR THESE FIRST RESPONDER ACCOUNTS. AND SO IT'S LIKE HAVING -- YOU KNOW I DEDICATED LANE. ON THE HIGHWAY FOR FIRST FIRST RESPONDERS IS THAT ESSENTIALLY WHAT IT IS. YOU JUST YOU DESCRIBED IT PERFECTLY OKAY SO ON THAT'S IT'S GREAT TO KNOW HAN ANSWERED AS THIS EXISTED IN THE PAST OR IS THIS SOMETHING NEW THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT. SO DO I WE ARE A LAUNCH THIS PRODUCT EARLIER THIS YEAR ON OUR SMARTPHONE SYSTEM AND THEN WE'D -- I THINK AS RUDY MENTIONED IN THE STATE AND BEEN WORKING -- IN THE PROCESS TO BRING FORTH THIS SORT OF PROGRAM ON OUR DATA SIDE OF IT FOR MOBILE BROADBAND SPECIFICALLY LIKE ROUTERS -- THAT HER MOBILE AND THESE TYPE OF UNIT SO THAT'S THAT'S WHERE THAT SYSTEM JUST LAUNCHED IN I THINK THAT THE MOBILE BROADBAND PIECE OF IT LAUNCHED IN THE LAST I THINK IT WILL ONCE IN THE LAST MONTH AND A HALF -- FOR THAT SORT OF ITS SMARTPHONES BACK IN APRIL OKAY SO SWITCHES ARE IN FLIPPED YES FIRST RESPONDERS AND WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW MANY. I DEVICES IN AN ACCOUNT THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE BUT HOW DO YOU DEFINE FIRST RESPONDER. HOW DO YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT NEEDS THAT CODE -- OR CODES THAT DO THAT I HAVE THAT LABEL HERE BUT WE HAVEN'T WE HAVEN'T LEGAL DOWN -- TO FIRE FIRST RESPONDERS. A PUBLIC SAFETY WEB POLICE FIRE EMERGENCY SERVICE SAYS THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT FBI AND THOSE -- SECRET SERVICE DOUBTS FIRST RESPONDER OFF -- AND OVERALL AND THAT YOU HAVE PUBLIC SAFETY I IN GENERAL THAT COVERS THE REST THAT WOULD BE BACK OFFICE AND WITH THAT INCLUDING. PUBLIC -- AGENCY AMBULANCES OR EVEN PRIVATE SECTOR AMBULANCE SERVICES YES -- AT AT ALL TIMES NOT JUST IN A DISASTER AND GODLY YES. AND DIE IN SO YOU YOU MENTIONED THAT. YOU KNOW YOU'VE MADE THESE. CHANGES FOR THIS CURRENT FIREFIGHTING MOMENT IN TIME THIS WEEK WE DON'T THE PLAN IS NEXT WEEK AND HOW YOU. SHIFT ALL THESE ACCOUNTS TO THAT NEXT PLAN AND WHAT THE PEOPLE WORKING PHONE CALLS AND APPROVAL PROCESSES THAT ALL THESE DIFFERENT PUBLIC AGENCIES MAY HAVE. TO GET TO THAT BUT FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE THIS WEEK WHICH I IMAGINE WOULD CONTINUE ON UNTIL YOU'RE ABLE TO HELP TRANSITION PEOPLE ABSOLUTE TO THOSE NEW PLANTS -- SEEMS. IN IN -- IN THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT YOU MADE IN AGAIN THANK YOU FOR FOR THE ANNOUNCEMENT AND THE CONTRITION -- NOTED IN IT THAT -- IT IS DISASTER CONTINGENT. SO HOW DO YOU DEFINE. WHAT DOES DISASTROUS MIGHT BE AND AND SINCE WILD FIRES ACROSS THE STATE IS ESSENTIALLY? THE CITY CALIFORNIA IT'S JUST DONE FOR CALIFORNIA AND HAWAII -- BORDERS IT A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC THAN THAT AND THEN HOW DO YOU DEFINE IT WE WE LOOK AT NATURAL DISASTERS -- CLEARLY WE AND ARMS AROUND HOW. TO REACT TO THE ONES YOU HAVE NO NOTICE TWO VERSES ARE HURRICANE WHERE YOU MAY HAVE TIME -- TO TO GO THROUGH THAT SITES WERE EVALUATING BOTH SIDES OF THE FENCE THERE AS WELL AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THERE'S MANY SITUATIONS WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT THROUGH. ARE THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT -- OUTSIDE OF FIRE THAT CAN BE POLICE DRIVEN I WAS SHOOTER SITUATIONS AND STUFF LIKE THAT SO THE GREAT PART IS THAT GO OUT WITH FIRST RESPONDERS. THERE IT WON'T MATTER ABOUT THE INCIDENT ITSELF BECAUSE THEY WILL ALREADY HAVE THAT ABILITY TO USE THAN THE NETWORK THAT WE WANT TO GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS. IT'S MORE OF FOR BACK OFFICE -- ADAM I WOULD SAY THAT THEY'RE THE PEOPLE THAT COULD BE POTENTIALLY NOT OUT ON THE FRONTLINE THAT COULD HAVE THAT PROCESS THEY NEED TO GO THROUGH SO YOU'RE. I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE SAYING IT'S NOT SOME THAT WE NEED TO WORRY ABOUT BUT THERE IS SOME TYPE OF CRITERIA FOR THE CONSIDERATION OF WHAT IS A DISASTER. AND WHO DO YOU WORK WITH TO DEFINE. WHAT THOSE CRITERIA MIGHT BE AND? TO GET TO THAT POINT YOUR HEART NOT IN IT YEAH TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT RIGHT NOW AND THEN I GOT YOU KNOW I I I WOULD SAY WE WE UNDERSTAND NATURAL DISASTERS PRETTY MUCH I THINK WHAT -- MOST OF THE WORLD WOULD LOOK AT ABOUT IT WHAT I WAS SAYING THERE SOME SITUATIONS WE PROBABLY HAVEN'T THOUGHT THROUGH -- A FIRST RESPONDER THOUGH -- AS A DISASTER LET'S SEE SOMETHING HAPPEN TO NEXT WEEK -- THEY WOULD NOT NEED TO SPEED CAPITA ALREADY BE OFF SO THEY DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT PART OF IT IS THEY GO THROUGH IT -- AND SO THAT'S WHAT WAS I WAS REFERRING TO AND NOT HAVING TO TO WORK THROUGH IT I THINK THERE'S WORK TO BE DONE INTERNALLY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'VE REALLY EXCLUSIVE AND BECAUSE WE THOUGHT OF ALL THE SITUATIONS THAT GETTING ANCHOR. DOES WITH NOTICE AND THOSE WITHOUT -- AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PUT THE PROPER STEPS IN PLACE SINCE WE HAVE A COMMITTEE INTERNALLY THAT'S WORKING ON THAT RIGHT NOW -- AS EVERYTHING HAS BEEN -- BROUGHT TO LIGHT AYE AS YOU WOULD IMAGINE THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH AMBER EYES AND ENSURING THAT WE PUT THE RIGHT STEPS FORWARD SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE. THAT THIS TYPE OF SITUATION HAPPEN AGAIN YOU GOT YOUR MOVING QUICKLY AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOU DOING THAT SO TO SPEAK CAPS ARE LIFTED THERE IS A NEW PLAN NEXT WEEK AND IT WILL TAKE TIME FOR THEM. TO BE ENROLLED IN THAT NEW PLAN BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO STOP PEOPLE FROM BENEFITING FROM. THIS STUFF BEFORE YOU GET TO THAT ABSOLUTE BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE ON EMERGENCY AND THEY'RE DOING THEIR JOB AND YOU WILL WORRY ABOUT BILLING LATER CORRECT. OKAY TWENTY MAKE SURE THAT WAS CLEAR -- IN IN THE LIFTING OF RESTRICTIONS AND THE DEFINITION OF DISASTER. DO YOU HAVE EIGHTY I ASK ABOUT THE CRITERIA. WHO MAKES THE DECISION ULTIMATELY WHO DEFINES THIS ORDER OR SAYS YET IT'S ALL BEEN MATT? IS THERE SOMEONE IN YOUR IN YOUR AT CORPORATE -- YOU KNOW HIERARCHY THAT DOES THAT THERE IS NOT ONE PERSON -- BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE OBVIOUSLY AND AND A LARGE BOTTLE NECK NAM IT'S A GROUP OF HAVE COMMITTEE THAT LOOKS AT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS BEING MET TOGETHER AND I WOULD SAY WE STILL NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF DEFINING. WHAT THOSE ARE REQUIREMENTS ARE WHICH I SPOKE TO EARLIER FROM A PROCESS STANDPOINT?BUT IF THERE IS AN ONGOING INCIDENT AMBER FOR HIMSELF AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GONNA BE OF LINK THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN INCIDENT WOULD HAVE TRIGGERED. I CAN ATTEST THAT COMMITTEES CAN BE BOTTLENECKS TO YES. HA AND DIED. YOU WERE WERE -- YEAH THINKING ABOUT -- THESE FORMAL YOU KNOW POLICIES AS YOU'RE MAKING THEM HOW -- TRANSPARENT WILL YOU BE. AND WHAT THOSE YOU KNOW THE CRITERIA MAY BE WHAT THAT COMMITTEE OR DECISION MAKING STRUCTURE IS SO IT'S NOT I WANT TO DETERMINE WHAT WERE YOU GUYS ACTUALLY END UP LANDING. AND AND HOW YOU FLIP THE SWITCH ON IT IS A DISASTER OR THAT A DISASTER IS OVER A PRIOR TO AYE AYE THE GOVERNOR OR SOMEONE ELSE REFERENCING SOME OFFICIAL DISASTROUS. YOU KNOW ANY ANY EMERGENCY IS A DISASTER FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE AT YEAH AYE AYE SYRIA GOING YET WE WOULD NOT BE WAITING FOR A STATE OF EMERGENCY TO BE CALLED IN AND THOSE SITUATIONS. I WOULD TELL YOU WE ARE RELYING OF FORMER THAT CURRENTLY WORK WITHIN THE VERIZON'S ORGANIZATION AS WELL AS CONSULTANTS ARE ON THAT SIDE TO HELP US DEFINE -- GOING FORWARD ON THAT SO THAT -- AYE AS YOU SAID EARLIER -- AS WELL LIKE IF IT WERE MORE EXPERTS ON THE MALL SIDE I WOULD HATE TO BE ON THE OTHER SIDE WHERE YOU'RE SITTING TODAY BECAUSE I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS. BOB A APPROPRIATELY AND SO WE'RE GONNA WILL DEFINITELY UTILIZE THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE AT OUR DISPOSAL. AND AND TO THE POINT ABOUT HAVING HIS FORMAL POLICIES HOW TRANSPARENT WILL THEY BE SO WE IS LAWMAKERS OR THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE DECISION MAKING THAT VERIZON IS IS USING. TO TO COME TO THESE CONCLUSIONS WILL YOU BE ABLE TO SHARE THAT WITH US. I THINK I AM I DON'T WANT TO AND I HOW 2% FOR SURE ON THE MAGNITUDE OF EVERY STEP BUT THE PROCESS WOULD BE SHARED. LEARNING FROM THIS ENVIRONMENT -- WITH OUR ACCOUNT REPRESENTATIVES TO SHARE WITH THEIR SPOCK'S -- POINT A CONTEXT WITHIN -- THE ACCOUNTS TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO FOLLOW THE PROCESS AND THAT WOULD THEN BE A PUBLIC -- A PUBLIC A PROCESS THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO SHARE YEAH BUT HE WAS STILL WORKING THROUGH THAT TO MAKE SURE THE STEPS ARE AND AND PLACE WHICH I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT -- TO ENSURE THAT THAT BEFORE ANY OF THOSE THINGS HAVE TO BE ONE PLACE THAT WE WE NOT MOVE FORWARD ON THE PLAN WE HAVE SPEED CAPS REMOVED AND WE ALLOW PEOPLE TO GET SERVICE -- APPROPRIATELY SELF THEY NEED TO IN THE NEXT UP THEY'RE ABLE TO GET IT DONE AT THE SPEED RESTRICTIONS ON THE DATA USED BY FIRST RESPONDERS AND IN THIS. INSTANCE THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY FIRED AGENCY -- IS ONE OF THE FACT THAT THEY HAD -- I CAP -- KIND OF A FALSE CAP THEY'RE ALLOWED TO GO OVER THE CAP AND PURCHASE MORE DATA BUT I IF IT WAS YOUR KID -- JUST WATCHING VIDEOS ON THEIR PHONE BUT FOR FIRST RESPONDERS. NOT APPROPRIATE AND AND SO THAT WAS JUST A MATTER OF HITTING THEIR CAP AND THEREFORE HAVING A SPEED RESTRICTION PUT IN PLACE AND SO THANK YOU FOR TAKING IT OFF. IT IS CONFLATED ARE OFTEN THIS WEEK WITH -- THE ISSUE OF NET NEUTRALITY WHICH THE LEGISLATURE IS ALSO DETERMINING AND AND IN IN IS A BIT OF A DIFFERENT ISSUE WHEREAS A SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE. AT YOU YOU MIGHT DESCRIBE THIS DIFFERENTLY BUT MORE OF THAT TOLL TAKERS IF YOU WILL ON THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY PAIN -- CHARGING MORE FOR CONTENT PROVIDERS TO BE ON THOSE ROADS -- SO TO SPEAK UP IN IN IN THE INTERNET -- TO THROUGH YOUR SERVICE AND DELIVERY TO THE CUSTOMER VERSUS JUST HITTING AT A DATA CAP -- DON'T SPEAK AT ALL ABOUT THAT DIFFERENCE TO CLARIFY THAT BECAUSE IT HAS COME UP AYE IN THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD IN AND PEOPLE ARE CURIOUS ABOUT THAT YEAH SURE AND I AND I I KNOW THAT MY COLLEAGUE HIDE YOU PERSONALLY ADDRESS THIS AT THE COMMITTEE HEARING. YESTERDAY AND THE DAY BEFORE BUT THIS ISSUE IS NOT ABOUT -- NET NEUTRALITY IS -- ONE ASPECT OF IT. ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF CONTENT DISCRIMINATION RIGHT THE HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION WHERE I INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER WOULD. SPEED ACCESS TO YOU KNOW HOW YOU KNOW SO CALLED FAVORED. CONTENT ON THE INTERNET ARE FAVORED WEBSITES AND SLOW DOWN ACCESS TO DISFAVORED -- CONTENT -- WE'VE MADE IT CLEAR IN OUR BROADBAND COMMITMENT WE DO NOT DO THAT. THE INDUSTRY HAS MADE CLEAR IT DOES NOT DO THAT -- THIS SITUATION IS NOT THAT THIS WAS A SITUATION WHERE A CUSTOMER -- REACHED AND ITS PRE PRESCRIBED LIMIT OF ITS CONTRACTUALLY AGREED TO DATA PLAN AND AS A RESULT THE SPEEDS WERE REDUCED. WE TO PROCESS THEM YEAH A MORE INFORMAL PROCESS IN PLACE WHERE THOSE WOULD BE LIFTED AND AN ERROR WAS MADE IT WAS OPERATIONAL AND WE'VE. ADDRESSED HERE SO. THESE ARE TWO COMPLETELY SEPARATE HA SITUATIONS TOTALLY UNRELATED TO THE ISSUE OF NET NEUTRALITY. AND I THINK YOU HURT FOR MAKING THAT NO I DIDN'T ASK YOU YOU KNOW WITH THIS SWEEPING REFORM OF LIFTING SPEED RESTRICTIONS FOR FIRST RESPONDERS IN A NEW PLAN NEXT WEEK. HOW MUCH HAVE YOU COORDINATED WITH YOUR PEER -- CORPORATIONS THAT PROVIDE THE SERVICES AS WELL I NOW I GUESS YOU CAN'T -- YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT AT A CARTEL WHERE YOU CAN SET. RATES -- TOGETHER -- LIKE SETTING THE PRICE OF OIL SO HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT THIS OR SYSTEM THAT YOU'RE DOING ON YOUR OWN THAT YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY DO COORDINATION ON PRICE SETTING. SO NO NO -- WHEAT WHEAT DEFTLY TAKE CARE OF INTERNALLY -- WHAT WE HAVE UNDER OUR JURISDICTION -- AND UNDER OUR CONTROL I WOULD SAY THOUGH IT DOES -- AND BIG NEED FOR INTER OPERATE SURE THAT YOU KNOW AS A FIRST RESPONDER THAT YOU CAN SPEAK ACROSS MULTIPLE NETWORKS -- AND WE ARE WORKING WITH OUR COMPETITORS ARE TRYING TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS -- TO ENSURE THAT THE AYE FIRST RESPONDERS TAKEN CARE OF REGARDLESS OF THE NETWORK THERE ON AT INTEROPERABLE HE'S EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT SO THANKS FOR MAKING THAT NOTE WE DID INVITE OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS TO COME UP IN AND TALK ABOUT IT FROM AN INDUSTRY PERSPECTIVE AND AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY DECLINED -- THAT IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF THESE CHANGES ARE SWEEPING ACROSS THE SECTOR THAT FIRST RESPONDERS ABLE TO BENEFIT NO MATTER. WHAT THEIR PLAN IS I AND WHO THEIR SERVICE PROVIDER IS -- SO I WILL AT THIS POINT IF THERE ARE NO OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE DAY AS SAY THANK YOU -- TO REPRESENT US FROM VERIZON AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL THAT YOU PARTICIPATED -- AND DOT DID YOU DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT YET MYSTERIES MISTER I JUST HAVE A QUICK QUESTION AS YOU MOVE FORWARD WITH THE CHANGES AND BETTER HAVE ACCESS -- WILL YOU BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL IMAGE AGENCY WHERE THE FIREFIGHTERS POLICE OFFICERS MAYBE HAVE THEM AT THE TABLE AS WELL. TO SEE MOVING FORWARD ON THE BEST FIT FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE AS WELL I KNOW YOU GUYS HAVE YOUR YOUR SPECIALISTS AND EARN YOUR DEPARTMENT. BUT I THINK WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE THE FIREFIGHTERS THE POLICE OFFICER WHERE THAT MAY BE. AT THE TABLE AS WELL TO TALK ABOUT MAYBE OTHER INSTANCES THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT MAY OCCUR THAT MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE BEST PLAN. MOVING FORT SO THAT'S ODD MATURE THROUGHOUT THE TABLES WERE ABSOLUTELY. RIGHT SO WE WILL WE WILL HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT BEFORE CLOSING STATEMENTS AND I SO I THINK YOU ARE THE THREE OF YOU FROM HER EYES AND FOR BEING HERE TODAY I REALLY APPRECIATE THE CHAIRS MEMBERS COMMITTEE THANK. AND AND SO I THINK THERE MAY NEED THE MICROPHONE -- OVER BY WHERE THOSE CAMERAS ARE. IF IF ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO PARTICIPATE IN PUBLIC COMMENT -- THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO DO SO NOW ALRIGHT SO THAT WILL BE THE LAST CALL FOR PUBLIC COMMENT MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ANY CLOSING STATEMENTS. ALRIGHT SO I I'LL ON ASK -- MY COLLEAGUE AND CO CHAIR MISLI KNOWN TO MAKERS CAME FOR IDEA RIGHT THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO THANK EVERYONE WHO'S PARTICIPATED I THINK AND THERE'S A FEW TAKEAWAYS ONE THAT IT'S AN ISSUE THAT THIS AD THAT MATTERS TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE. AND PUBLIC SAFETY IS SOMETHING THAT WE THINK ABOUT PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF THE NUMBER OF NATURAL DISASTERS THAT ARE HAPPENING. AND TWO THAT THERE IS AN INTERESTING. AND OUTSIDE OF THIS PARTICULAR HEARING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE CAN DO HOW WE REPLICATE BEST PRACTICES AND ENSURE THAT THIS IS -- THESE INCIDENTS DON'T TRANSLATE INTO ANY PATTERNS ARE TENS UM AND THREE DATA IT IS CLEAR THAT -- YOU KNOW ONE OF OUR BIGGER TELECOMMUNICATIONS I ENTITIES AND I IN OUR COUNTRY IS MOVING FORWARD WITH A DIFFERENT PLAN AND THAT WE WOULD LIKE. TO SEE AND HEAR HOW OTHERS ALSO RESPONDED IF THIS IS SOMETHING AND THAT IS TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. I KNOW THAT -- THE THOMAS FIRE I SPENT FORTY DAYS -- DEALING WITH THAT PARTICULAR NATURAL DISASTER AND THERE WERE SO MANY MISTAKES I MADE ERRORS -- I HAD THAT HAPPENED -- IT'S HARD TO PREVENT AND PREDICT ALL OF THEM. AND WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ENSURE THAT THEY DON'T HAPPEN AGAIN -- AND THAT THEY ARE. PIECES OF THE I'M A BIGGER CONVERSATION AND THAT -- WILL NOT IMPACT THE SAFETY OF ANY INDIVIDUALS -- SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO IDENTIFY WHAT THOSE ARE I FEEL LIKE OUR COMMITTEE HAS DONE THAT TODAY. ON WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY THAT BUT ALSO WHAT THE SOLUTION WILL BE MOVING FORWARD I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY INVOLVED ESPECIALLY ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUES AND IT COULD HAVE BEEN ON THEIR WEIGHT BACK TO THEIR DISTRICT TO SERVE YOUR CONSTITUENTS THAT HAVE STAYED HERE -- TO BE PART OF THIS CONVERSATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM COCHAIR -- WANT TO SAY THANK YOU EVERYONE WHO PARTICIPATED TODAY -- THAT REPRESENTS FROM VERIZON ALSO CHIEF OUT AND THIS. WAS NOT A FIRE DRILL WE HAD OF THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE FIRES IN THE STATE'S HISTORY JUST LAST YEAR. SO I THINK WE ALL WERE I SURPRISED THAT SUCH AN INCIDENT CAN OCCUR AGAIN I'M GRATEFUL THAT DIED THAT RISING RECOGNIZES. THAT THEY NEED TO CHANGE THE WAY THAT THEY DO THEIR BUSINESS AND I AND I AM GRATEFUL AGAIN FOR CHIEF BOWDEN'S LEADERSHIP TO MAKE SURE THAT HIS STORY. IS TOLD THANK YOU ALL FOR PARTICIPATING [inaudible] VETERANS OVER [inaudible] MOVING [inaudible] DON DOT
