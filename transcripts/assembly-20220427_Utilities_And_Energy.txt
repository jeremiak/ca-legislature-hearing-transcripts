DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME IS. TO WAIT. IN THE THEY WILL. BE IN THE WRONG FOR PUBLIC POLICY IF YOU'RE TO ASK YOUR- WOULD THEY LIKE THEIR ALARM CLOCKS SET AN HOUR EARLY ALL WINTER THEY WOULD SAY NO BUT THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL WOULD FORCE THEM TO DO IT WOULD BE SUCH AS- CLOCK IN THE- SENATE FIVE IN THE MORNING- IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA I HAVE HERE A COMPARISON PHOTOGRAPHS SHOWING YOU. WHAT WENT. IT WOULD LOOK LIKE. THIS IS ANAHEIM AT SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING STANDARD TIME VERSUS THE DARK DAYLIGHT TIME. THIS IS- TO HATCH A P. THIS IS THIS IS SAN FRANCISCO AB DARK PAST EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING IN THE WINTER WITH PERMANENT DAYLIGHT TIME. THIS WAS TRIED BEFORE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES A HUGE AND POPULAR IT LITERALLY KILL CHILDREN. THIS IS A PHOTOGRAPH OF CHILDREN WAITING FOR BUS TO SCHOOL IN THE MORNING IN THE DARK. MEMBERS OF MEDIEVAL SUPPORT OF START SCHOOL LATER TWENTY NINETEEN THIS BILL WOULD REVERT THOSE BENEFITS BY FORCING PEOPLE TO GO TO SCHOOL OR WORK. IN THE DARK- IT'S THIS IS ABOUT IT THIS IS UTILITIES AND ENERGY COMMITTEE. DAYLIGHT TIME INCREASED ENERGY CONSUMPTION BECAUSE GOING TO WAKE PEOPLE UP IN THE MORNING THEY TURN UP HEAT BECAUSE IT PULLED. IT'LL WAIT A LATE. THERE IS OR MORE ARM A- THAT'S THERE IS OWN INTO NOT HAVE. DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME AT ALL WHEN INDIAN INTRODUCED DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME IT INCREASE THEIR ENERGY CONSUMPTION BY NINE MILLION DOLLARS. PER YEAR. IT WAS INCOME STATED THAT THERE ARE NO STATES CONSIDERING STANDARD TIME THAT IS NOT TRUE I COULD NAME AT LEAST A DOZEN. I'M MISSIONS UP UP OBSERVE. TIME MEXICO'S CONSIDER. CENTER TIME. THIS BILL IS OPPOSED BY THE NATIONAL SAFETY COUNCIL THE AMERICAN ACADEMY SO IN THE CALIFORNIA. C. EIGHTY I. AND I THERE'S- COMMAND- THIS OF MEASURE- THAT PERMITS THEM TIME IS QUICKEST AND FEDERALLY PRE APPROVED WAY. TO END DAYLIGHT SAVING THAT TO AND CLICK CHANGE AND I THE GAME BIRD IS THAT YOUR LEG. POSE THIS BILL ENCOURAGES AMENDMENT TO STANDARD TIME THANK YOU VERY WELL I'M GONNA ASK THE MODERATOR AFTER ONE. TO THIS. OKAY. BUT THE NEXT QUESTION WAS DO WE HAVE MODERATE. THE TAKING A BREAK ANYONE IN THE IN THE IN THE ROOM HERE WOULD LIKE TO- TESTIFIED OPPOSITE NAME ORGANIZATION. OKAY I UNDERSTAND A DOCTOR WAS TO CALL IN TO SPEAK WERE WERE WERE OF OUR GROUP. IN THIS MY FIRST UPSTAIRS IS NOT RESPONDING OKAY SIR- MISTER MODERATOR MISTER MISTER. MADAM MODERATE MOUNTAINS HELLO YES SENATE HEARING YES. MY NAME IS DR ANOOP K. PARK AND- I AM CALLING FROM SAN DIEGO CALIFORNIA I WILL BE THERE IN PERSON I AM- BOARD CERTIFIED PSYCHIATRIST TYLER DALTON TRIED BY A DIRECT HIT MEDICINE SPECIALIST AND ALSO THE ATTRIBUTES THAT. I'M NOT REPORT PENDING THE CALIFORNIA OF THE- WE- DR IN ORDER IN. DONALD ALL RIGHT GOD LEWIS AND ALSO THE SAN DIEGO THANK AT THE PROVIDE THE FIVE AND BOTH MEN PROBLEM THE PSYCHIATRIST MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND THE CHILD PSYCHIATRIST ON THE STATEMENTS AND TAKING ACTIONS IN CALIFORNIA IN OAKLAND THE BILL. THANK YOU. ALSO THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE IN THE ROOM THEY WANTED TO SPEAK TO AN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL- I'LL SEE GREENBACKS DIES ANYONE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR. YEAH I'M GOING TO JUST. BUT I'VE I'VE BEEN CONFLICTED ABOUT THIS I'M JUST TELL YOU STRAIGHT OUT- KIND OF BACK AND FORTH. UP BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE NATURAL CYCLE OF THINGS. IS NOT DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME AND I THINK THE OPPOSITION MAKES. A SIGNIFICANT POINT OUR BODIES ARE ATTUNED TO WHEN THE SUN COMES UP AND WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN. ARTIFICIALLY IT SEEMS TO ME SETTING THE CLOCK THAT ACTUALLY WARS AGAINST. THE NATIONAL RHYTHM OF LOS. SO I'M THAT LAY OFF ON THIS- I CAN'T SUPPORT IT NOW- NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO AND THIS IS A SORT OF A- PAROCHIAL THING WITH ME BECAUSE OF THIRTY YEARS OF OWNING AND OPERATING RADIO STATIONS. AND I KNOW THAT THE BROADCAST INDUSTRY HAS BEEN SILENT ON ALL OF THIS. BUT THE REALITY IS. THAT THE THREE LETTER CALL STATIONS CAME J. THE OTHER CALL. THIRD IN AND EVERYBODY ELSE IN ORDER TO GET MIKE TIME BROADCASTING HAS TO LOWER THEIR POWER I WANT RADIO STATIONS IN CALIFORNIA AND IDAHO PAST THE REALITY IS THAT MY RADIUSED I'VE SOLD BY STATIONS A FEW YEARS BACK BUT- THE REALITY IS. THAT DURING THE DAY A. M. DRIVE TIME YOU MENTION UNTIL SOMETHING LIKE EIGHT FIFTEEN OR EIGHT THIRTY. I WOULD BE BROADCASTING AT A THOUSAND WATTS. INSTEAD OF TEN THOUSAND WATTS. THIS IS THIS IS THIS CREATES A REAL BURDEN. FOR THESE M. STATIONS THAT HAVE TO LOWER THEIR POWER IN SOME INSTANCES THESE RADIO STATIONS HAVE FIVE HUNDRED WATCH AT NIGHT. AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE BROADCAST. TILL NINE O'CLOCK EIGHT THIRTY AND LOSE. THERE CITY LICENSE COVERAGE JUST ABOUT. SO YEAH I KNOW IT'S PAROCHIAL UNKNOWN THERE'S NOT OPPOSITION FROM BROADCAST BUT AS A THIRTY YEAR BROADCASTER UP REDDIT REDDIT STATIONS ARE GOING TO BE A AND A AND- AND PARTICULAR THE DAYTIMES. YOU'RE A LOT OF DAYTIME STATION TO GO OFF THE- SO THEN I CAN BE A SIGN ON. MORNING MAKE YOUR YOU'RE DESTROYING ESSENTIALLY THEIR THEIR PRIME TIME SPUR FOR REVENUE. SO I'M CONFLICTED ABOUT IT FOR BOTH THOSE REASONS BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY I THINK THE NATURAL RHYTHM OF LIFE BUT LOOK MY LIFE IS LIVED AROUND THE SUN COMES UP WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN. REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE CLOCK SAYS. ALL RIGHT SO I CAN'T GET HERE TO SUPPORT THIS. I'M GONNA LAY OFF OF IT- ALLY I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD DO WELL WHAT'S BEEN. SUGGESTED BY THE OPPOSITION THAT THANK YOU. DR- START WITH A CO WORKER. AND SINCE NONE THANK YOU I WAS A CO AUTHOR IN REGIONAL BILL SINCE THEN. GOT A LOT OF INPUT. FROM PEOPLE WHO STUDY OUR NATURAL RHYTHMS. AND CRITICALLY IN THE WINTER. THEY'RE GOING TO THEY'RE CONCERNED. ABOUT PEOPLE WAKING UP BEFORE THE SUN COMES UP. AND THE EFFECT THAT THIS HAS ON THEIR BIO RHYTHMS. SO I'M GOING TO BE SOME. STANDARD TIME YOU. R. THANK YOU.

MAYBE FULL OR HOLDEN. DUE TO PHYSICAL EXCESSIVE SEAT LIMITED FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS ONE WAY THE STATE CAN ADDRESS THESE ISSUES IS THROUGH THE USE OF COMMUNITY RENEWABLE PROJECTS WHICH ARE TYPICALLY SMALLER SCALE SOLAR INSTALLATIONS BUILT ON LANDFILLS FORMER INDUSTRIAL SITES ARE SMALL PRIVATE PARCELS OF LAND. THESE PROGRAMS OPERATE IN TWO WAYS CONSUMERS. AS TO LOWER COSTS FOR POWER PAYING A MONTHLY FEE AND THEN EARNING CREDITS ON THEIR ELECTRICAL BILLS OR CUSTOMERS MAY PURCHASE SHARES PROPORTIONATE TO THEIR ENERGY NEEDS. ON A SET AMOUNT OF A COMMUNITY RENEWAL PROJECTS POWER GENERATION CAPACITY. HOW CAN YOU RENEWABLES ARE VERY PRACTICAL COST EFFECTIVE SOLUTION THAT ALLOWS MORE CAL MEANS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES. OTHERWISE PEOPLE AT THE BENEFITS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY ATTEMPTS A COMMUNITY RENEWAL. IN FUTURE. INDOOR SIMPLY NEAR SCOPE AND RANGE THIS IS CREATED IS THE NEW.

BROWN'S I WHICH ONE COME READ. THERE ISN'T THE MOST UNDER. NONE OF CALIFORNIA'S PROGRAMS IN EXISTENCE TODAY CURRENTLY PROVIDE OR CAPABLE OF PROVIDING THE COMPREHENSIVE AND SCALABLE SOLUTIONS ENVISIONED IN AB TWENTY THREE SIXTEEN WHICH WOULD CREATE ONE OF THE MOST INNOVATIVE COMMUNITY NO MANAGER PROGRAM COUNTRY BUT THE RIVER BINDING TO CAL.

IT CETERA- IT'S VERY HARD I THINK FOR US AS LEGISLATORS TO REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW ALL OF THESE WORK TOGETHER AND TO SEE WHAT THIS BILLS OF THE CPUC ALREADY- WAS ASKED TO LOOK AT TWICE NOW TO LOOK AT A SIMILAR PROGRAM. THEY BASICALLY SAID. WE HOPE HELLO ENOUGH RIGHT NOW TO DO SOMETHING WE NEED MORE TIME- IN IT CAN. BOTH THE CONSULTANT AND FRANKLY THE ANALYSIS SAYS THAT THERE IS LIKELY TO BE A COST SHIFT- WHAT'S THE OTHER CONCERN KASHIF- ONE MORE. AREA. I GUESS THAT'S ENOUGH- THE- THE OTHER THING IS WE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE NO TROUBLE AT ALL BUILDING ALL THE SOLAR WE MEET- BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAVE THE MANDATE. UTILITIES CAN BE. YOU KNOW THEY CAN PUT IN FORM THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS MIL MAYBE EVEN A MILLION HOMES WITH JUST ONE FARM TERMS OF REACHING OUR GOALS. I THINK THIS IS TOO COMPLICATED FOR ME ANYWAY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON. THE CPUC HAS SAID THAT THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO UNDERSTAND THAT AND I CERTAINLY DON'T. I WOULD PREFERRED THAT THERE SIMPLY GOT ONE. THANK YOU. DR ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF MISTER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR I THINK ANY TIME WE TRY TO. YOU KNOW HAVE A- SOME KIND OF CONVERSATION REGARDING ANYTHING THE CPC DOES THAT'S OFTENTIMES- JUST FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD IT JUST IT TAKES A LONG TIME FOR THE PC TO ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING. AND I DON'T MEAN TO BE DISRESPECTFUL TO THE P. C. R. TO THE FOLKS THERE BUT WE HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH THE ISSUE OF THE KASHIF RELATED TO NOT A JIMMY DURING FOR QUITE SOME TIME IN FACT THE PC HAS MANDATED. TO THERE IS NOW IN THE- A NEW LEADERSHIP AT THE P. YOU SEE ADS WE HEAR FROM. EXCUSES LIKE I'M NEW AND I NEED TO CATCH UP AND I NEED TO DO THIS EVEN THOUGH STAFF HAS BEEN THERE FOR MANY YEARS AND SO I JUST YOU KNOW I WANT TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THE INTENT OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO CREATE BUT- BASED EVEN ON THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THAT GOES FURTHER THAN THE BILL THAT I CURRENTLY HAVE ON TWENTY. TWENTY ONE FORTY THREE RELATED TO NAM AND PREVAILING WAGE. AND I'M I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED OF ADDING ADDITIONAL. UP WORK TO THE P. YOU SEE WHEN THEY HAVE YET TO DO THE WORK THAT THEY CURRENTLY HAVE AND SO I WILL BE VOTING IN SUPPORT OF YOUR BILL TODAY BUT I HOPE THAT AS THE RECISIONS FULL WHAT WE CAN BUY SOME CONCERNS THAT BASED. I'M PERSONALLY RELATES DOLLAR PREVAILING WAGE RESIDENTIAL ROOFTOP SOLAR ADDRESSING THE CAUTION- AND THEN REALLY ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF HOW DO WE CREATE. A CLEAN GREEN ECONOMY WITH THE WORK FORCE THAT IS. EARNING THAT SAME WAY H. AS IN THE REDUCTION OF FOSSIL FUEL SO ALL OF THAT IS COMBINED. AND THESE ARE THINGS THAT YOU AND I. UP BUT AGAIN MY CONCERN IS JUST SIMPLY CREATING ADDITIONAL THINGS FOR THE P. YOU SEE TO DO WHEN THEY'VE YET TO ACTUALLY DO THE THINGS THAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY MANDATEDTO DO. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OKAY THE NOT DIRECT TO A DRESS SOME OF THE COMMENTS QUESTIONS OR CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I AM GRATEFUL FOR THE COMMITTEES DEEP ANALYSIS ON THIS AND AGAIN MINDFUL THAT- WITH THAT SOMETHING THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE REALLY WORKING SOME OF THE IMMIGRATION DETAILS THROUGH THE PVC. PIPE SHARE. SUMMARY OF THE ISSUE OF THE PC AND THEIR ACTIONS AND I'M SURE THERE ARE REASONS WHY THEY TAKE AS LONG AS THEY DO- BUT TO THE EXTENT OF THEIR THE ISSUE WE BELIEVE WITH THE- SPONSORS AND THOSE THAT WERE WORKING WITH ON THE BILL. THAT ON THE COSTS OF USE WILL BE. NEGLIGIBLE AT BEST AND HOPEFULLY WILL NOT BE THERE AT ALL GIVEN BOTH THE- DESIGN OF THE PROGRAM THAT WE'RE TRYING TO- AUTHORIZE HERE. AS WELL. WHAT WE OTHER CANNOT. WHEN THEY WORK ON IT WITH REGARD TO ANY M. THREE POINT NO THIS IS ALL LINE YOU KNOW THROUGH A PART OF THAT WORK TO- WORK IN PROGRESS AND I KNOW THE DETAILS OF NOT BEEN FINALIZED RIGHT NOW BUT I APPRECIATE THE ABILITY TO FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD. SO THAT WE CAN GIVE LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS THOSE THAT DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO ROOFTOP SOLAR THOSE THAT NEED THIS ALTERNATIVE- AUTHORIZATION AND ESPECIALLY WITH A LOT OF FEDERAL SUPPORT THAT WE KNOW IS COMING DOWN HERE. THAT WE HOPE WILL BE- AVAILABLE TO CONSUMERS POTENTIAL CONSUMERS IN YOUR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE I THINK IT WILL HELP US MEET OUR GOALS EVEN FASTER.

TURN IS A PROUD SPONSOR THIS BILL PROTECTING RATEPAYERS FROM FUNDING REMEDY THAT UTILITY AGREES TO ENTITLEMENT IN ORDER TO AVOID PROSECUTION. BUT OFFICE BILL UTILITIES BABY CAVALIER ENOUGH TO TRY AND SHIFTING COSTS TO RATEPAYERS DOING SO DEFEATS THE PURPOSES OF HOLDING THE UTILITY ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE MISMANAGEMENT AND SALES OPERATIONS OF ITS FACILITIES. THE EIGHTY THREE PLACE. AND THE WRONG TO OUR AND DOES ALLOW TO TAKE ON A UNMARKED COST.

HOLD THE DA'S ACCOUNTABLE TO PUTTING THIS COMPANY I'M CONTINUE PROBATION. I TOOK THIS DIRECTION BUDGET ALSIP THE CINEMA COUNTY COOPER. DID ONE HOSTILE WHAT WHILE PER OCCURRING THE- WHY THE AG STEPPING IN. WHAT'S HAPPENING AND GIACOMIN. GIVE US BETTER TOOLS TO DEAL WITH THESE TYPES OF CORPORATE CRIMINALS. YES YOU DO NEED SETTLED LARGE MARIN SONOMA COUNTY HISTORY. FOR THE CORPORATE EQUIVALENT OF A PARKING TICKET AND WAS REWARDED WITH THE STAFF ON ABOUT SOME REPAIRS. THE SETTLEMENTS ALL MADE PHD INTERVIEWED LIKE TRY AND I. ASSAULTS VALUE ATG REASON THEY ARE FOUND RIGHT IN CRIMINAL AS PART SEVERAL. THESE REASONABLE YET CRIMINAL CONTRADICTIONS ARE UNTENABLE I THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR TIME AND AGAIN MY VOTE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY EIGHTY THREE I'M HOPING IT'S ONLY QUESTIONS. ABOUT MY ENGAGEMENT IN THESE CASES. THANK. GO TO- IN THE ROOM FOR OTHER SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION TO SUPPORT. OPPOSITION OKAY LET'S DO THIS TO OPPOSITION WITH DISPENSED WITH THE SUPPORT TESTIMONY. GOOD AFTERNOON GOING THAT HONEST GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC AND SOCALGAS I'M HERE IN OPPOSITION RESPECTFULLY ASK WE BELIEVE THIS BILL- CIRCUMVENTS THE CPC'S EXCLUSIVE FORTY TO REVIEW- COSTS AND IMPROVE EXPENSES- THAT ARE JUST AND REASONABLE AND WE BELIEVE THAT THAT AT THIRTY SHOULD MAINTAIN A BE MAINTAINED. YOU SEE A COUPLE OF THE THAT WE HAVE IS THEM. WE BELIEVE THAT THERE'S A COUPLE OF DIFFERENCES IT IT THIS BILL WOULD INTERFERE WITH- SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT I'M TO EXTENT TELL ME. BY THAT. I IMPROVE TO- THE SYSTEM INCREASED OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE. OR OTHER RELATED COSTS THAT ARE HAVE TO DO WITH ELECTRICAL INFRASTRUCTURE- AS- AS BILLS DRAFTED IT WOULD APPLY TO WORKS IN PROGRESS AND ALREADY PLANNED TO- WORKS IN PROGRESS OUT WIND LIQUIDATION BEGINS AND WE FEEL LIKE THAT IS NOT APPROPRIATE BY EXTENSION. THE BILL ALSO WOULD UNDERMINE AT THE WILDFIRE FUND DEAL FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WE UNDERSTAND THE MEMBERS TRY TO CLARIFY THAT- WE WOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO SEEK RECOVERY WHEN PROSECUTED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL DA'S- COUNTY CITY ATTORNEY'S ECCENTRIC BUT- EXPANDS THE BILL TO ALSO INCLUDE CIVIL PROSECUTIONS. ON THAT PARTICULAR REFERENCE MORE PAYMENT UNDERMINE THE AB TEND TO DO FOR FRAMEWORK IT CHANGES THE TERMS OF THAT PARTICULAR ON LEGISLATIVE DEAL AND OUT AT THAT TIME WE RELIED. ON THAT PARTICULAR NEGOTIATION WHEN WE LIKE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE WILDFIRE FINE- SO. THAT BEING CHANGED THAT WE FEEL LIKE- IT WOULD IT WOULD. SKEWS ME SO THAT PARTICULAR REMARK AT THAT TIME- ALLOWED AS EACH NEED TO THE RIGHT TO SEEK RECOVERY FOR SETTLEMENT AMOUNTS PAID TO RESOLVE WILDFIRE RELATED CLAIMS- AND THAT A BILL ALSO ESTABLISHED A PRESUMPTION IN FAVOUR OF RATEPAYER FUNDED RECOVERY FOR THOSE AMOUNTS IF ELECTORAL CORPORATIONS- HOLD A VALID A VALID STATE IT DIFFICULT SO THE DIFFERENCE BEING THAT. THERE ARE SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS ON THE ONE HAND AND THERE ARE ALL THESE LINES ON THE OTHER HAND WE FEEL LIKE THIS KIND OF. THAT'S MENTIONED THE ADDITIONAL AGAIN OF ADDING CIVIL PROSECUTION WHICH WE BELIEVE INTERFERES WITH AB TEN FIFTY FOUR DEAL SET TO CONCLUDE- JUST GENERALLY SPEAKING WE- THE US WEAPONS HE- THE WRONG IN THESE PARTICULAR DECISIONS THEY'RE NOT APPROVING CRIMINAL FINES OR PENALTIES FOR RECOVERY FROM RATEPAYERS- SO WE'RE UNSURE WHY. INTO A- THEM AT THE- FOR THOSE PARTICULAR CASES WERE HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR I'M TO ADDRESS HIS CONCERNS ABOUT STEVEN WROTE DOWN TO DISCRIMINATE PROSECUTION BUT- FOR TODAY AND FOR US. AS A TODAY AND RESPECT WHAT POSITION WOULD PRESENT ABOUT THANK YOU. YEAH ADAM SMITH SO THERE ARE SOME ALSO OPPOSING I THINK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC SAID IT VERY WELL SO I WON'T RETREAD THE SAME GROUND ADELINE MY COMMENTS. BUT WITH HERS ON THE REAL POINT OF THE MATTER LET THE PC WE THINK HAS COMPLETE DISCRETION OVER THESE. REASONABLE COST WHETHER THE REASON OR NOT ALREADY NOT SURE WHAT THIS BILL IS KIND OF ADDING TO THAT EXPLICITLY. BUT I'D ALSO SAY I THINK ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE'VE WHEN WE WERE TRYING TO. ASSESS THE LANGUAGE AND HOW IT WOULD IMPACT WHAT WE'RE ALREADY DOING ON WILDFIRE IT'S NOT REALLY CLEARANCES. WANT TO KEEP TALKING THE AUTHORS. ABOUT AND WE URGE YOU TO- CONSIDER AS WELL THERE ARE OFTEN TIMES WHERE IN AIDS YOU KNOW MAYBE A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WE MIGHT EVEN. COMMIT TO THINGS IN AGREE TO THINGS LIKE. YOU KNOW KIND OF RAMPING UP CONTRACTOR ENFORCEMENT AND MANAGEMENT ND OVERSIGHT. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WHILE IT'S PART OF A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT. LIKE HECK RAISED OTHER ISSUES OR OTHER INTERESTS ACROSS OUR BROADER SERVICE TERRITORY AND INSTEAD OF KIND OF JUST NEARLY FOCUSING YOU KNOW ON THE CONTRACTOR OVERSIGHT IN A SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC REGION WE MIGHT RAMP UP CONTRACTOR OVERSIGHT ACROSS OUR ENTIRE SERVICE TERRITORY THIS BILL AND THE LANGUAGE BUT SENATE RIGHT. TO MAKE IT CLEAR IT THE RAMP UP. SITE BECAUSE WE REALIZE HEY THAT WAS A PROBLEM THERE THAT WOULD LIKE TO FIX DOESN'T MAKE IT CLEAR THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY GO TO SECRET RECOVERY FOR THOSE ACTIVITIES IS WHEN THEY FALL UNDER THE BILL. CAN BE SOMETHING THAT WILL KIND OF PSEUDO PART OF THE SETTLEMENT WOULD BE SOMETHING WE COULD ACTUALLY GO TO THE PC TO DISCUSS AND SEE IF THE BROAD BASED. YOU KNOW HOW. THE FITTING THE BROADER RATE BASE AND THAT'S WHAT WE LIKE TO JUST KIND OF PRESERVE HERE IS THE PUC'S ABILITY TO DETERMINE WHAT IS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST WHAT ARE JUST AND REASONABLE COSTS AND WE THINK THAT THE BILL AS IT SITS TODAY BLURS THOSE LINES RESPECTFULLY BUT- A NO VOTE. HI SIR BRING YOU BACK WITH SPECIFIC GUEST LECTURED WOULD LIKE TO ALIGN OUR- OUR CONCERNS WITH IT AT A SAN ANTONIO WE HAVE NOT TAKEN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THE BILL BECAUSE IT WAS JUST AMENDED. EIGHT DAYS AGO- BUT WOULD YOU HAVE IF YOU TURN AT THAT GIVEN HOW BROAD IT IS GIVEN IT WAS MENTIONED- BY THE SUPPORT WITNESSES WE HAVE ZERO INTENTION OF RECOVERING ANY OF THE RECENT SILENCE FROM CUSTOMERS. ARE CONCERNS ARE RELATED TO HELP. GO FOR THE- WITH REGARD TO TYPICAL- VEGETATION MANAGEMENT ISSUES SO WE ARE RESPECTFULLY POST NEXT. AND MOVED FROM MODERATOR WITH PUBLIC COMMENT NEXT RIGHT. YEAH WE'RE GONNA MOVE A- TO PUBLIC. COMMENTS IS THIS ON THE PHONE OR NOT. SO ON THE PHONE. WE'RE GONNA DO THIS AHEAD OF PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE. OKAY SO WE'RE GOING TO A PUBLIC COMMENT- IS THIS IN SUPPORT OR IN OPPOSITION OF BOTH ALL ALL RIGHT SUPPORT OPPOSITION. ON THE PHONE PLEASE. THE ONLY PRIVILEGE SPEAK ON THIS BILL PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. JUST NOW WE DO HAVE. ONE COMING UP. MISTER CHAIR WILL GO WITH ONE EIGHTY SIX PLEASE GO AHEAD. YES GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM ACTUALLY CALLING IN ON A PREVIOUS- BILL. THE PHONES ARE DOWN AB TWO EIGHT SIX EIGHT THAT THE PERMANENT DAYLIGHT SAVING. I DO WANT TO RAISE AN OBJECTION BECAUSE AFTER THE COMMITTEE WOULD NOT PRESENT FELT SORRY THAT THAT BILL'S BEEN HEARD IN VOTED ON. I'M SORRY THAT THE- YOUR YOU'RE TOO LATE SIR. SORRY BROWN TWENTY. TWENTY EIGHTY THREE. I HAVE NO ONE ELSE THANK YOU AT THE TIME. YEAH I WE'RE GONNA GO NEXT TO WELL WITNESSES IN THE HEARING ROOM IN A SUPPORT AND SUPPORT OPPOSITION OR IN BETWEEN I WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN AB TWO ZERO EIGHT THREE OF SO PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME ORGANIZATION AND POSITION. SEE THAT WOULD. YEAH. I'M GONNA MOVE TO MEMBERS ANY- QUESTIONS. COMMENTS MEMBERS BUT QUICK ARE YES SO THIS IS MY CONCERN- FIRST OF ALL IN THE SETTLEMENT WHOEVER IS SUING COULD JUST SAY UNDER THESE TERMS- YOU CANNOT ASK FOR REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE C. P. U. C. THAT CAN BE PART OF THE SETTLEMENT. SECOND AS WAS POINTED OUT THE CPUC IS IN GOOD POSITION TO DECIDE. WHAT IF FIVE IF IN THE SETTLEMENT. THEY DON'T DECIDE TO DO THAT THEN THE CPUC COULD DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT IT SHOULD BE BUT THEY ALL THEY ALWAYS HAVE THAT OPTION OF JUST MAKING. THAT PART OF THE SETTLEMENT THE THIRD CONCERN I HAVE IS THAT IN EFFECT THIS LIMITS WHAT YOU CAN SUE FOR. AND HERE'S WHAT I'M ME IF THE H. G. IF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL GETS INVOLVED BECAUSE IT'S MULTIPLE SMALL COUNTY SAY AROUND TRINITY WHERE THE COUNTIES ARE SO SMALL. AND THEY REALLY CAN'T BRING THE SUIT. IT REALLY LIMITS WHAT THAT THE AG COULD DO THE AG FOR EXAMPLE MIGHT WANT TO SAY ALRIGHT SYSTEM WIDE. G. IN AB THAT'S HAS ALL THESE SMALL COUNTIES THAT- YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO X. Y. AND Z. HERE. AND THAT COULD END UP BAY UNDERGROUND LINES WHATEVER A HUGE COST. SOMETHING THAT MIGHT SEND THE COMPANY INTO BANKRUPTCY WHICH WE DO NOT WANT TO DO SO THE AGE SHE CAN'T ASK FOR THAT BECAUSE THE ALTERNATIVE IS BANKRUPTCY FOR THE COMPANY. AND THAT'S WE'VE LEARNED THAT'S NOT SMART. SO THIS IN EFFECT WHAT THE STATE BILL IS DOING IS LIMITING WHAT YOU CAN SUE FOR AND FOR THAT REASON I WON'T BE SUPPORTING IT. ANY OTHER MEMBERS. MISTER SEA WATER WORK CLOTHES AND ASK IF YOU'RE GOING TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE YEAH SHE SHE GREW TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS ALL. RIGHT AND WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I WILL. IS HERE A MOTION OR A SECOND AND A SECOND ON A B. TWO ZERO EIGHT THREE. HELLO GIPSON EMOTIONS WHICH MOVIES ARE SECOND OKAY.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I THINK A- THE ONCE THROUGH COOLING PLANT IS. FIRST ON THE AGENDA. THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS BUT SHARE AND FOR THE COMMITTEE- I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB TWO ONE FOUR ZERO. WHICH SEEKS TO. STOP DELAYING THE SHUTTING DOWN OF THE ONCE THROUGH COOLING NATURAL GAS POWER PLANTS THAT- WAS ORIGINALLY SCHEDULED FOR THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY. I WAS EXTENDED ONCE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND WAS A- EXTENDED AGAIN- IN ORDER TO MEET OUR SB ONE HUNDRED GOALS OF TRANSITIONING 21100% CLEAN RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE WE NEED TO HAVE OUR DEADLINES MATTER. THIS DEADLINE TO PHASE OUT HE WANTS TO COOLING POWER PLANTS BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY WAS ADOPTED IN TWENTY TEN. WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO APPROACH THIS IN A RESPONSIBLE MANNER AND APPRECIATE THE- THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS TO ENSURE THAT TO THAT THE SHUTTING DOWN OF ANY ONCE THE COOLING PLANTS- DO NOT UNDERMINE. EITHER STATEWIDE OR LOCAL ELECTRICITY I BUILDING. BY REQUIRING AS A CONDITION OF NO FURTHER EXTENSION FOR THE- ADVISORY COMMITTEE WHICH INCLUDES THE P. YOU SEE THE ENERGY COMMISSION B- HI SO- AS WELL AS THE WATER BOARD- TO DETERMINE. AT THE SHUTTING DOWN OF THE- COASTAL- ONCE THROUGH COOLING PLANT WOULD NOT JEOPARDIZE- ELECTRICITY RELIABILITY. AND I WANT TO ADD THAT TO JUST RECENTLY- IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR THAT ADVISORY COMMITTEE ISSUED A REPORT THAT CONCLUDED AS STATED IN THE COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES- THE COMMITTEE DID NOT. FORESEE OUR RECOMMEND ANY CHANGES TO THE COMPLIANCE SCHEDULED THUS FAR AND SO YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD IN THIS COMMITTEE THAT THE PC IS TESTIFIED- PRESIDENT REYNOLDS TESTIFIED THAT THEY HAVE- ISSUED THE ORDERS FOR PROCUREMENT FOR- ADEQUATE ENERGY TO- ALLOW FOR THE SHUTTING DOWN ONCE AND FOR ALL OF THESE CALLS SO- ONCE THROUGH COOLING PLANTS- AND SO WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO- TO SUPPORTING WITNESSES FOR THE SPELL- THE MAYOR OF REDONDO BEACH BILL BRAND HAS BEEN FIGHTING THIS BECAUSE- SINCE. TWENTY TEN CLOSE SHOT UP TWELVE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA COAST KEEPER LINES. GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS BILL GRAN. ON THE BEACH FOR FIVE YEARS AND WITH THE COUNCIL MEMBER IN THIS DISTRICT WITH EIGHT YEARS PRIOR THESE ONCE THROUGH COOLING REGULATIONS WAY BACK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. USED TO BE A CHEMICAL ENGINEER SOME VERY COMFORTABLE DISCUSSING IS VERY TECHNOLOGY. I WAS ALSO A MEMBER OF THE TRANSPORT WORKERS UNION LOCAL FIVE OH TWO LA ACTS. THE ONE YEARS. AT A LARGE POWER PLANT OWNER COACH IN REDONDO BEACH FOR OVER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY YEARS BELIEVE IT OR NOT THIS PARTICULAR PLAN IS NOW ALMOST SEVENTY YEARS OLD NINETEEN POWER PLANTS WERE CITED ON THE COAST CALIFORNIA IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY THE USE OF OCEAN WATER TO COOL FOR OPERATIONS OF THE TREMENDOUS DAMAGE. MARINE ENVIRONMENT EVERY LIVING ORGANISM THAT IS TUCKED INTO THE MASSIVE INTAKES DICE. BUILDING BLOCKS OF OUR LOCAL MARINE ENVIRONMENTS OUR STATE WATER BOARD PASSEDWHAT IS KNOWN AS WHAT YOU'RE CALLING REGULATIONS WAY BACK IN TWENTY TEN TO PHASE OUT THE USE OF OCEAN WATER TO COOL THEIR PLANTS AND THEY WORK CLOSELY WITH THE STATE ENERGY AGENCIES A POWER COMPANY TO ESTABLISH THE STATE'S WITH THAT WOULD BE THE RETOOL OUR PERMANENT RETIRE. THE STATE'S FIRST CAMPUS TWELVE YEARS AGO THE DATE FOR EXTENDED FOR FOUR POWER PLANTS BY THREE YEARS AT THE POWER SHORTAGE BACK IN TWENTY TWENTY IT BEEN ADDRESSED. BUT NO ONE CURRENTLY SERVES THE WATER BOARD WAS AROUND WHEN THESE REGULATIONS WERE CRAFTED AMPS. WE CAN YOU DO THE DEADLINE SET COMPANIES A RENOWNED BEACH. FORTY MILLION DOLLARS YEAR. JUST TO BE ON THE READY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER. THEY'RE CALLED. POPPERS THE EXTENSION THE CITY RECENTLY LOST OVER FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN STATE GRANTS FROM THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY AND THE CALL TO CONFIRM TO RESTORE THE WEAPON HERE AND CREATE PUBLIC OPEN SPACE PROJECT. IN THE MOST DENSELY POPULATED AREA THE ENTIRE CALIFORNIA COAST. IS A LONG ESTABLISHED RETIREMENT DATE HALF IT MEANS SOMETHING AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO KEEP SAID AND IT'S CLEAR TO ME AFTER ATTENDING EVERY HERE. ONLY ACTUALLY. TO PREVENT THE BRANCH FROM COULD YOU TO OPT. LEGISLATION WEALTHY OUT LOUD BECAUSE POWER PLAY YOU CAN OP IF HE AGENCIES LIKE TIGHT SO. IN THE PAC AND THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. EIGHT TWENTY ONE TODAY THE ENERGY AGENCY THEN POWER COMPANIES WILL MEET THE CHALLENGE BUT ONLY IF YOU PUT A STOP TO THE IDEA OF SIMPLY STANDING THE OPERATION OF SEVENTY YEAR OLD PLANTS THANK YOU. CAN IN CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME SEAN BOTTLE IN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR CALIFORNIA BECAUSE KEEP RELIANCE. ON OUR ORGANIZATION IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY A GROUPS THAT ADVOCATED FOR NEGOTIATED THE ONCE THE COOLING POLICY OVER A DECADE FROM BASICALLY TWO THOUSAND TO TWO THOUSAND TEN- THEN. IN INVOLVED. PROBABLY ONE OF THE SOLE PRIMARY PEOPLE OF WORKING ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ONCE YOU. DANCE TO THAT TEN I'M OVERLAP WILL YEARS. THE INTENSE THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE WANT TO GO INTO. WILL PROTECT GREEN LIGHT FROM WANTS TO. WELL SURE IT WOULD RELY BILL. IN THE END IN THE CALL BY. A INTO THOUSAND TEN WE- THAT POWER PLANTS PHASE OUT WANTS TO. BUT WE DO WE PUT IN THAT MEASURE TO AND- GRID RELIABILITY FIRST- WE CREATED A COMPLIANCE SCHEDULE THAT WAS STAGGERED NOT EVERYONE HAD A COMPLY RIGHT AWAY SOME POWER PLANTS DID. SOME POWER SUCH. CONTENT WELL THE SEVEN PHASED ON FOR THE LAST TWELVE YEARS AND BE CAN TILL TWENTY TWENTY NINE- AND THAT WAS TO ENSURE THAT WE WEREN'T LOSING ANY GRID RELIABILITY AS WE FACE THESE OUT. AND THEN SECOND ADJUSTMENTS TO POINTS DIDN'T TO BE MADE. THAT WAS MADE THROUGH THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THIS ADVISORY GROUP SECUESTRO WHICH IS COMPRISED. THE ENERGY. AGENCY HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT GROUP MEETS EVERY YEAR GIVES A CONDITION THAT WATER FOR EVERY YEAR ON GRID RELIABILITY AND MOVING FORWARD WITH A COMPLAINT AT ALL. THIS TWENTY ONE FORTY UP HOLDS A COMPROMISE THAT. EIGHT IT RELIES STILL SACK WAS TO THE DECISION. TO LIABILITY WILL BE INTERRUPTED OR NOT I WOULDN'T BE HERE RIGHT NOW IF WE DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL DIDN'T ALIGN WITH THE INTENT AND THE COMPROMISE THAT WE NEGOTIATE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TEN. SO IF BY CHANCE FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU I'M GONNA ASK YOU FOR THE PRIMARY WITNESS AN OPPOSITIONAL COME FORWARD THEN WE'LL GET THE PHONE LINE RICK GO CALL PEOPLE IN THE ROOM. THE MOBILE. THANKS. MISTER CHAIRMAN A MEMBER SCOTT WHICH ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS THANK STATE PIPE TRADES COUNCIL BECAUSE WE SHOULD UTILITY EMPLOYEES THE WESTERN STATES COUNCIL OF SHEET METAL WORKERS I WAS ACTUALLY ONE NEGOTIATED WITH THE WATER BOARD THE ONCE THROUGH COOLING POLICY THE OBJECTION WE HAVE HELLO THIS THERE'S JUST A NUMBER OF THINGS IN THIS AND IN THIS BILL. THEY'RE FACTUALLY NOT SUPPORTABLE THE FIRST ONE IN THE IN THE FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS IS. THAT THERE WAS THE THIS DESPITE THE STATE BOARDS DEADLINE. THERE WERE DEADLINES THERE WAS A SCHEDULED PUT FORWARD THE DATE HOPE TO REACH BUT SPECIFICALLY THE POLICY STATES NO READ ITTO YOU THE STATE WATER BOARD RECOGNIZES THE COMPLIANCE DATES POLICY MAY REQUIRE AMENDMENTS. BASED ON THE NEED TO MAINTAIN LIABILITY JUST THIS PAST YEAR THEY EXTENDED THE LIFE OF A HANDFUL OF THESE PLANTS BECAUSE WE NEED THEM TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE TERROR OF FROM THE BY DIMINISH PATIENT THIS GOING TO STOP LOCAL THE- Y. J. FOR ALL THE RENEWABLE PROJECTS THAT WE. SHE MEANT. THIS IT SHOWS THAT THERE IS A COMMITMENT MADE THAT'S SIMPLY JUST THE NARRATIVE BEING CREATED THAT COULD NOT BE A SLAVE DECORATION THINGS LAPSLEY THE BIGGEST CONCERN THAT WE HAVE IS THIS BILL GREAT IT'S WE WOULD ARGUE UNCONSTITUTIONAL DELEGATION OF LEGISLATIVE AND ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO BE HAVE THE DECISION MAKING POWER ON WHAT THE FUTURE OF THE PLAN. I WISH BE. AS IT. THEY ISSUED A NUMBER DECLARATION OF IS CAN IS V. FAMILIAR WITH GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY IT FULLY OUT THIS SUMMER WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A REAL PROBLEM WHAT IS THE ADMINISTRATION. I THINK VERY SPONSORED BELIEVE THEY'RE OUT- PROCURING EVERY NATURAL GAS PEAKER PLANT AVAILABLE IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE. AND WHERE ARE THEY LOCATED WELL OF COURSE THEY WERE LOCATED NEXT TO LOAD WHICH IS WHAT INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES PRIMARILY AND WHERE OUR INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES LOCATED IN MISTER GIBSON'S DISTRICT THE BUSINESS CAREER WAS DISTRICT ASSEMBLY MEMBER RACES DISTRICT. SO LET'S PROTECT THIS WEALTHY COMMUNITY IN REDONDO BEACH WHO IS INCONVENIENCED BY THE FACT THAT THERE IS. POWER PLANT THERE THAT OPERATES FOR FIVE DAYS A YEAR LET'S KEEP BRING IN THE PEAKER PLANTS THE REGULAR OPERATE EVEN MORE THAN THAT AND THAT ARE DIRTIER THAN THE OUR PLACE. IN ALL OF YOUR DISTRICTS- YOUR URGENT THIS BILL AND BE AMENDED OR HELPING COMMITTEE THANK YOU- JAZZ BUDDY JONES FOR THE INDEPENDENT ENERGY PRODUCERS AND- WE REPRESENT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO REPLACE THESE PLANTS AS WELL AS THE PEOPLE WHO OWN THESE PLANTS SO- WE- DOES NOT. WANT TO COOL. BY THIS IS ABOUT. UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES DO THESE BIG PLANS CONTINUE UPDATE HAVE EXTENSIONS AND I JUST IF THIS BILL WAS FORWARD I WONDER YEAH I'M WE WERE OPPOSED TO THIS. BUT THE KEY KEY ISSUE THAT THE AND- WHICH IS REFERRED TO. THERE'S ALREADY BEEN A- A PROCUREMENT ORDER DONE BY THE P. YOU SEE TO REPLACE THESE UNITS AS WELL AS DIABLO CANYON OKAY DOUBLE CANDY GOES OFF TWENTY FOUR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. AT THE WANTS TO CALL UNITS ARE TO A THINK AGO- SCHEDULED TO GO OFFLINE AND TWENTY TWENTY THREE. WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME FOR. THE THAT SO THAT WAS PROCUREMENT ORDERS ARE OUT THERE THE PROBLEM IS BETWEEN THE SUPPLY CHAIN PROBLEMS CAUSED BY KOBE. KOBE CHINA SHUT DOWN SALAS YOUR BATTERIES ARE ON A BOAT RIGHT NOW YOU'RE OUT OF LUCK HOPEFULLY YOU'RE OUT THAT HE VALLEY STUFF WORKS WE SHOULD GET STOP DEPENDED UPON- IMPORT STUFF. AND THAT WE TO WHICH SIGNIFICANT DELAY WITH RESPECT TO- REPLACEMENT OF THESE THINGS THAT IN THE OUT YEARS. I DON'T KNOW GOING TO HAPPEN HOPE IS THAT WE SELL THROUGH WHICH I THINK A MISTER MERRETT WHICH BASIC. OF IT OUT- THE EAGLET REPORT ON WHAT. THESE BILLS NOT. BUT IF IT'S IF WE RUN INTO PROBLEMS WE NEED TO AVOID ANY UNNECESSARY FRICTION IN TERMS OF HOW DECISIONS GET MADE SELL A LEVERAGE OF MINE'S BIGGER THAN MINE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT THAT IS A CONCERN WE NEED THANK YOU. THANK YOU WHAT I'M A IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL IF YOU COULD PLEASE HAVE THE- AND IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION ON THIS BILL PLEASE PRESS ONE AND YOUR AT THIS TIME. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME ON JAZEERA KNOWING TO AT THE TIME OKAY WELL UP ANYONE IN THE ROOM. WE SHOULD COME FORWARD AND SPEAK IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY ONE FORTY. OKAY SEE NO ONE. HELLO BRING BACK TO THAT QUESTION SO START TO THE FAR RIGHT. MR LEWIS GOES REYES SO THE WORK ANYWAYS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I HAVE IS CONCERNS AS NOTED BY BY. THE SPEAKERS AT AND THESE DO HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED I- TO SAY THAT IT THAT'S A DEADLINE- BLAND IT'S A SCHEDULE AS OPPOSED TO SAYING THIS IS THE DROP DEAD DATE I THINK IS IMPORTANT TO THAT'S A TO NOT- IT. I WILL BE A COURTESY I'VE TODAY. BUT THE ISSUES MUST BE ADDRESSED BEFORE GOES TO THE FLOOR- AND I KNOW THAT YOU WILL. BE MEETING WITH THE OPPOSITION TO. IF THAT DOES HAPPEN. I HAVE A COUPLE DIFFERENT COMMENTS THE NOW SUS NOTES AND THIS IS PRETTY WELL WELL PUT SO KUDOS TO WHOEVER. WROTE IT ALL THREE ASPECTS OF RELIABILITY SYSTEM LOCAL INFLEXIBLE MUST BE MAINTAINED IT GOES ON TO SAY WITH THE CPUC NOTES MOST ENERGY RESOURCES ARE SCHEDULED TO COME ONLINE AS PLANNED. AND THUS THE CURRENT RETIREMENT SCHEDULE IS UNLIKELY TO CHANGE THE PANDEMIC EQUIPMENT SHORTAGES JENKINS WORK FOR OUR FAULTS COULD WE DO A RESOURCE DELIVERY. THIS BILL MAY LIMIT STATE AGENCY RESPONSE SHOULD UNEXPECTED DELAYS OCCUR NECESSITATE ANOTHER REVIEW OF THE OTC REQUIREMENTS SO IF I CAN MAKE MY SECOND POINT AND THEN IF THE AUTHOR OR ANY OF THE WITNESSES SUPPORT COULD ADDRESS THAT CONCERN BECAUSE THAT SEEMS. FAIRLY WELL FOUNDED I MEAN WERE ENTERING A POSITION WE'VE GOT RED AND RELIABILITY TERMS THAT IS POISED ON A KNIFE'S EDGE TO BEGIN WITH WE'RE LOSING OF OUR MAJOR ASSETS IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WITH THE ABOVE ANYTHING OFF LINE. UP PERCENT THE STATE'S ENERGY PRODUCTION. IT SEEMS LIKE THIS BILL TO ME RESPECTFULLY IS MOVING IN THE DIRECTION OF LESS FLEXIBILITY IN SOME AND MORE. THE OTHER ISSUE IN THIS IS MORE HIGHLIGHTED BY MR WET BUT I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON IT COMMONER FEEDBACK IS. YEAH THE CONSTITUTIONALITY THIS IS. TO ME MEAN YOU'VE GOT A- SORT OF PODGE SORT OF AGENCY THAT'S KIND OF THIS FRANKENSTEIN CREATION CALLED. SACK WES ARE SOMETHING FOR WITH PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER OTHER AGENCIES. I NOBODY VOTED FOR IT. A HOUSES IT'S NOT AUTHORIZED IN STATUTE- BUT NOW WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THAT THE ENTITY. THE POWER TO OVERRIDE THE WATER BOARD WHICH IS AUTHORIZED IN STATUTE- UNEQUIVOCALLY IF I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE BILL'S DOING CORRECTLY- AND THAT RAISES OTHER ISSUES WHERE. YES SOME OF THESE THINGS WE YOU KNOW WE WANT LOCAL CONTROL LOCAL INPUT OVER OUR ENERGY ASSETS TO A DEGREE BUT- THERE'S A REASON WE HOUSE A LOT OF THESE DECISIONS TO ME VERY RATIONALLY. AT THE STATE BECAUSE THAT LEVELS MAYBE LESS INFLUENCED BY NIMBY CONCERNS LESS INFLUENCED BY LOCAL INPUT AND HAS IT THE ABILITY AND THE FREEDOM AND LATITUDE TO STEP BACK AND LOOK AT THE OVERALL GREAT RISK RELIABILITY- SO THAT'S THE- BUT THIS BILL IT EVEN SETTING ASIDE THE CONSTITUTIONALITY FOR SECOND I WHICH I DON'T I DON'T GET I DON'T GET HOW. ABOUT SOMETHING THAT WAS NEVER AUTHORIZED IN STATUTE NOW IS GOING TO TAKE PRIORITY AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO OVERRIDE AN AGENCY THAT IS AUTHORIZED IN STATUTE ON A DECISION RELATING TO WATER. THAT THAT DOESN'T PENCIL OUT TO ME SO. I'M NOT IN A POSITION WHERE I. CAN SUPPORT THE BILL BUT IF THE- IF THE SUPPORTERS WOULD LIKE TO MAYBE ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES WITH RELIABILITY AND THE DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY TO THIS- BACK WITH AGENCY- YOU KNOW IT MIGHT. IT MIGHT HELP YOU OUT. IN THE- START YEAH OKAY. SO WE ABSOLUTELY WANT TO ADDRESS THE RELIABILITY ISSUE AND THAT'S WHY WE TOOK THE AMENDMENT TO MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT THE STATE BOARD SHALL NOT GRANT THE- ARM THE MOCK UP I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S A IN FRONT OF THE COMMITTEE BUT TO THE STATE PARTY SHALL NOT GRANT. AN EXTENSION ONLY IF. THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS ARE MET AND WILL THE FIRST CONDITION. IS THIS STATEWIDE ADVISORY- COMMITTEE TASKED WITH ENSURING ENERGY RELIABILITY- DETERMINES THAT THE EXTENSION IS NOT NECESSARY SO ALL THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE SUPPLY CHAIN ALL THE ALL THE CONCERNS ABOUT- ABOUT- UNEXPECTED WEATHER CIRCUMSTANCES ANY CONCERN RELATED TO RELIABILITY WILL BE ADDRESSED BYE BYE SACRIS YOU KNOW IN AFFECT THIS IS A SIMILAR TO. SOME OF THE BILLS- MISTER PARK THAT WE HEARD OF THE I MEAN. LIKE MOST ABOUT IT AND THE SHIP IS SAY IN FOR OF THE- TO SHUT DOWN THESE ONCE THROUGH COOLING POWER PLANTS YOU KNOW. I WILL AMENDED MS REYES THE- THE FINDING AS TO THE DEADLINE I AGREE THAT- THAT- THAT IS- THAT THAT DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT WAS INTENDED TO BE- YOU KNOW FLEXIBLE. THIS IS A REPLY ABILITY AND- YOU KNOW YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT THAT I WILL MEN THAT BUT IN TERMS OF- A RELIABILITY THAT IS ADDRESS THROUGH THE- REQUIREMENT AT ONLY F. THIS ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT INCLUDES THE PVC THE ENERGY COMMISSION. HI SO ONLY IF THE SPIES RICK HE FINDS THAT NO FURTHER EXTENSION IS NECESSARY WILL- THIS BILL- KICK INTO EFFECT SO IN IF IN EFFECT GOING BACK TO MR QUIRK. I'M THIS. IS GONNA THE THIS IS ALREADY. TO SHIP DOWN BUT YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE HAVE ALREADY HAD TO EXTENSIONS WERE BOTH SHUT DOWN BY THE END OF TWO TWENTY. STAND TWENTY. AND NOW. THREE WE WANT TO- SENSE OF A KICK IN UP A PULL MATH- THE- TO RE AND THE FACT. THAT THE SHOW HAS SAILED TERMS OF THE POLICY THAT WAS ADOPTED IN TWENTY TEN TO CLOSE DOWN THE ONCE THE CLEAN POWER PLAN BACK IN TWENTY TEN AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY- STAY WITH. THE CONNECT IT THE ELECTRICITY RELIABILITY ISSUES ADDRESSED SO THE IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY THE SACK WAS ENTITIES STILL IS MAKING THE ULTIMATE DECISION AS TO WHETHER. THE SAP THIS IS GOING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF WHETHER- PLANT IS NECESSARY OR NOT AND TO ENSURE ELECTRICITY RELIABILITY THAT THAT IS WHY THOSE TWO PRIOR EXTENSIONS WERE GRANTED AND THE EXTENSION FROM FROM TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THEN THAT SET FROM TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE HE WAS GRANTED BECAUSE SAC WIS FACT AND THE IS STILL. THESE UP PEAKER. YOU KNOW I A BACKUP OPTION IN ORDER TO ENSURE STATEWIDE A GRID RELIABILITY SO ESSENTIALLY THIS IS. CODIFYING WHAT IS ALREADY TAKING PLACE THAT SACK WAS. MAKES THE FINDING AS TO ELECTRICITY RELIABILITY CAN CAN YOU STRUCTURE RECORD CAN YOU JUST SAID HIGHLIGHT WHO IS. EQUITIES YOU KNOW THE JEAN PUBLICITY HAVE NO IDEA YEAH I CAN DO THAT CERTAINLY I MEAN SEQUITURS- AS A- YOUR COMMITTEE ANALYSIS EXPLAINS- THE STATEWIDE ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON COOLING WATER INTAKE STRUCTURES. INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE STATE WATER BOARD THE ENERGY COMMISSION THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AND THE CALIFORNIA. THERE'S A- SPECIFICALLY TASKED WITH- ADDRESSING THE GRID RELIABILITY CONCERNS I KNOW THAT MISS BOTHWELL- ALSO DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN BUT BUT I THOUGHT I THOUGHT THE BILL THAT COULD NOT CHANGE THE STRUCTURE I THINK UNDER THE CAR STRUCTURE SAT. I RECOMMEND IN THE WATER THE WATER BOARD MAKES THE DETERMINATION BUT THIS WOULD CHANGE ITS- SACK WAS MADE THE ACTUAL DETERMINATION AM I WRONG ABOUT THAT. YES I AM NOT SURE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING YES I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MEANS YES I'M WRONG FOR U. S. SENATE NOT ROCK BUT COULD WITH CHAIRS IMPORTANCE COULD MISTER WHICH HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY INTO. GIVES THE DEFECTIVE DECISION. TO SACK WAS. AS IF YOU READ IT IT SAYS THAT THE STATE BOARD SHALL NOT GRANT AN OPERATOR AND EXTENSION. IF SACRIFICE AS THE IF THE POWER IS NOT NEEDED. OKAY AND I AGREE WITH YOU. ABOUT THE UNCONSTITUTIONALLY BECAUSE IT'S NOT IN STATUTE. THE WATER BOARD COULD ADD ADDITIONAL ADVISORY PARTICIPATES AT THEIR OWN AT THEIR OWN DISCRETION THE WAY THAT SACK WAS WORKS IS IT HAS TO BE YOU UNANIMOUS DECISION OF THE THREE PAGES THAT'S HOUSING EIGHT TWO THAT'S VERY. BUT WHAT THE AUTHOR DIDN'T. MENTION IN TO QUESTION IT'S STILL DELEGATES THIS IS ALSO THIS AUTHORITY TO AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND AS A PROP TO THAT. THE TROUBLE. THERE'S THAT THAT'S WHERE THE REAL CONSTITUTIONAL. IT APPROPRIATE DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY LIES IS GREAT BUT YOU ALSO HAVE TO THEN GO GET THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SIGN OFF ON THAT- THAT'S WHAT WE OBJECT YOU FOR. AN OBJECT TO THIS WITH BROUGHT. WHAT YEP TO. REFERENCE TO A COMMITMENT IS THERE A DOCUMENT THAT SHOWS ITS COMMITMENT THERE'S NEVER BEEN A COMMITMENT MADE BY THE WATER BOARD SO THAT'S INAPPROPRIATE THAT'S THAT IS TO BE USED ENOUGH IF VENUE. THAT'S WHY JACK A CHECK TO. LOCAL GOVERNMENT SORT OF A VETO. I DON'T PERSONALLY WE DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH CYCLES SO I THINK THE FIRST POINT YOU MADE IS BEING CLARIFIED WITH ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS RIGHT. I'M CAN ONE OF THE ONE OF THE FINDINGS DECLARATIONS BUT NOT ON BOTH OF THEM MR OF CUTTING IT WASHINGTON COURT .COM ARE YOU WILLING TO TAKE OUT BOTH THOSE THE- CONCERN SAYING THIS NOT ROOM TO. THEY WOULD SEE WHICH SAYS ON OCTOBER TWENTY FIRST DESPITE THE EARLIER COMMITMENT TO REFUSE TO GRANT FURTHER EXTENSIONS I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY COMMITMENT MADE BY THE BOARD TO REFUSE TO. BACK TO THAT DIRECT MADE BY THE STATE WATER BOARD TO MYSELF AND TO SENATOR BEN ALLEN WHEN WE TESTIFIED IN OPPOSITION TO THE EXTENSION OF TO BE THE PLAN V. THE- WATER BOARD. CHAIR STATED THAT- THIS WOULD BE THAT THE FINAL EXTENSION ARM. AND- ACTUALLY UP WELL I'M NOT SURE IF IT WAS A CHAIR IF IT WAS IT WAS- THAT THEY THEN BECAME BUT A COMMITMENT EIGHT WAS MADE NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT THE FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS- YOU KNOW ARE NOT THE SUBSTANCE OF THE OF. WELL ME TO WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION TO CLARIFY ANY OBJECTIONABLE AT AGE- THAT- MISTER WATCHES SO UPSET SO I'M GOING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND I MOVED TO BELL. OKAY MANY QUESTIONS FROM ANY WELL I HAVEN'T IN SUPPORT- THAT THERE WHAT WAS YOUR SEX. THAT'S INTERESTING ALL RIGHT HERE'S WHY YOU SHOULD SUPPORT THE BELL. OF THE WAY THIS IS SET UP WELL LET ME ADDRESS THE QUESTION OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY FIRST. OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING THERE IS NICELY ASKING OUR SACK WITH. THIS AGENCY ARE TO CONSIDER CLOSING. THE AGENCY STILL HAS THE FINAL WORD SO AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED THIS REQUEST IF IT ENDS UP BEING A REQUEST JUST LIKE FRANKLY ANYTIME THEY WANT TO CITE A PLANT A LOCAL AGENCY CAN SAY NO WE DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD DO WITH THEIR AND THEN INSIDE IT TWICE I THINK THAT'S- THAT'S REALLY CHANGING THANK. I AM CONVINCED THAT WITH THESE AMENDMENTS- THAT- RELIABILITY IS AGREED TO AND THE WATER BOARD. REALLY WANTS TO SHUT THESE DOWN I HAVE NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT AND PROBABLY OF THE TIME WHOEVER SPOKE WITH YOU- FELT THAT WE WERE THERE AND THEN THEY CLOSED DOWN A COUPLE NUCLEAR PLANTS AND THIS HAPPENED AND THAT HAPPENED AS LONG AS YOU'RE GUARANTEEING RELIABILITY WHICH YOU ARE WHEN IT GOES THROUGH SACK WAS NOT. YET OUT AND I'M OKAY WITH THE BILL IN THE END WHAT THIS. IS JOB LEADING. LET THANKS. THAT THIS SHOULD BE ADDRESSED I DON'T THINK IT'S ANYTHING MORE THAN THAT AND- HE COULD HAVE DONE A RESOLUTION THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER BUT WHATEVER I THINK THIS IS FINE AND I'M GOING TO BE VOTING THANK YOU SO FULLER IS AMONG ON THE FLOOR IN. QUESTIONS COMMENTS. YOUR SECOND. SECOND SECOND TO GET- JACK CLOSE THANK YOU VERY I AM. AGAIN I WILL COMMIT TO A- ADDRESSING THE OBJECTIONABLE LANGUAGE AND THE FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS- I ALSO YOU KNOW WANT TO CLARIFY THAT- YOU KNOW LOOK I I'M A LAWYER I DON'T WANT ANYTHING UNCONSTITUTIONAL I THINK THAT WE CLARIFY THAT THE- ULTIMATE DECISION YOU KNOW CONTINUES TO REST WITH THE STATE WATER BOARD. BUT IT'S UP. I KNOW THAT IN- THE PREVIOUS COMMITTEE NATURAL RESOURCES THERE WAS A DISCUSSION ABOUT. THE LOCAL. FORMAL RESOLUTION BEING STRONGLY CONSIDERED RATHER THAN BEING A YOU KNOW A REQUIREMENT THAT IF THAT WOULD. ALLAY CONCERNS ABOUT- YOU KNOW OF A LOCAL ENTITY. SOMEHOW I'M EXERCISING POWER OVER STATE AGENCY THEN- I. I BELIEVE THAT THAT IS THE DIRECTION THAT I WOULD LIKE TO- TO- HAD TO ALLAY ANY CONCERNS ABOUT TO. ABOUT THAT AND I WILL COMMIT TO A MIXTURE TO WORKING WITH YOUR STAFF THANK YOU TO MAKE THAT CLEAR I THINK DUE TO YOU ACCEPTED THE AMENDMENTS ON OF CORALINE OVERSTATEMENT SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH YES- I DON'T AMEND TO PROBE.
