A NORMALLY IF YOU SEE HAS FORMAL JUDICIAL PROCESS SEES AND- IN THAT THEY EVALUATE A VARIETY OF REQUEST RELATED TO THE INDUSTRIES THAT THE CQC REGULATES THIS BILL IN PARTICULAR WOULD NO LONGER REQUIRE IN STATURE TO PRE HEARING CONFERENCE FOR RE PROCEEDING OF PRE HEARING CONFERENCES WILL STILL BE ALLOWED OR THOUGH STILL TAKE PLACE BUT THEY WON'T BE- INS IN STATUTE NOT EVERY.

DODD AYE HERTZBERG HERTZBERG AYE HILL HILL AYE MCGUIRE RUBIO RUBIO AYE SKINNER STERN WIENER. WIENER AYE HERE FROM LAST YEAR WE YOU- TO THE CHAIR AND TO MEMBERS FOR HEARING THIS BILL TODAY AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING CLOSELY WITH US ON THE BILL- AND I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT ALL OF THE AMENDMENTS- THE CHAIR HAS PROPOSED IN THE ANALYSIS SO AGAIN THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH US- AND BECAUSE IT ALSO WON A TOAST. NOTE ON THAT THIS LEGISLATION YOU MAY RECALL I PUT THIS BILL AND THE PRINCE IN SEPTEMBER AT THE VERY END OF SESSION AND I DID THAT VERY INTENTIONALLY BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO COME BACK AND DROP- A SIGNIFICANT BILL IN AND THEN HAVE TO HAVE A MOVE QUICKLY- WE WANTED TO GIVE THE ENTIRE FALL FOR. YOU KNOW STAKEHOLDERS TO LOOK AT IT AND GIVE FEEDBACK WE DID RECEIVE QUITE A BIT OF FEEDBACK OVER THE FALL AND WE MADE AMENDMENTS LAST WEEK AND NOW WE'RE TAKING IS FURTHER AMENDMENTS A WILSON OF THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND THAT BLACKOUTS. AND BLACKOUTS ARE A HUGE ISSUE- THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND THAT THEY WILL BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION- IN OUR THE WORKING GROUP THAT WE'VE ESTABLISHED IN THE SENATE AS WELL AS ALL OF OUR CONVERSATIONS UP WITH THE GOVERNOR'S WE KNOW THIS WILL BE A CONTINUING CONVERSATION ABOUT SB THREE SEVEN A I THINK IS A GOOD FAITH. EFFORT TO TRY TO GRAPPLE WITH THESE GALS THAT ARE HAVING A HORRENDOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA- WE'VE SEEN THAT- IN- GINNY TERRITORY OF COURSE IN MOST DRAMATIC FORM OF BLACKOUT AFFECTING ABOUT. A HALF MILLION PEOPLE. SEEN IT CALIFORNIA WELL. I'M MORE CLEAR I'M NOT AGAINST PLANNED PLANNED BLACKOUTS AS A GENERAL MATTER THEY CAN BE A VERY USEFUL TOOL PARTICULARLY- FOR UTILITIES LIKE P. GINNY THAT HAVE ALLOWED THEIR SYSTEM TO DETERIORATE SO BADLY THAT'S CAUSING A HUGE WILDFIRE RISK WE HAVE TO REMEMBER WHAT THE ROOT CAUSES YOU TO IN A THE FAILURE TO MAINTAIN INFRASTRUCTURE- BUT IT ISN'T UNTIL WE CAN GET THAT TURNED AROUND PLAN BLACKOUTS SHOULD BE ONE TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX. BUT THE CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE AND WHAT WE HAVE SEEN- PARTICULARLY WITH P. GINNY BUT NOT JUST. ANY IS THAT THERE IS UNFORTUNATELY RIGHT NOW A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF BROADER BLACKOUTS- BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THE UTILITIES- IN A- AT THE COST OF DOING A BLOCK OF THERE'S A COST. BUT I IS NOT THEY DON'T HAVE TO INCORPORATE ALL OF THE COSTS THAT THE UTILITY IS INFLICTING ON THE POP IN GENERAL POPULATION. THE ONLY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THEIR OWN COST BENEFIT BALANCE FOR THE UTILITY ITSELF. AND THE UTILITY DOES NOT EVEN HAVE TO OTHER THAN THROUGH POLITICAL PRESSURE. THE UTILITY DOES NOT HAVE TO PAY ANY ATTENTION. TO THE COST AND THE HARMS INFLICTED ON PEOPLE AND THOSE COSTS ARE REAL IT'S NOT JUST AN INCONVENIENCE RIGHT THAT YOU CAN'T WATCH YOU KNOW CABLE TV OR YOU OR IF YOU DON'T HAVE BATTERIES YOU CAN'T LISTEN TO YOUR RADIO OR YOU. YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T YOU KNOW PLUG IN YOUR FOOT MASSAGER IT'S NOT JUST CONVENIENCES. THIS IS ABOUT LIFE OR DEATH IN A LOT OF SITUATION WHEN WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE WHEN A YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE MEDICAL DEVICES THEY HAVE TO PLUG IN OR THEY HAVE REFRIGERATED MEDICATION- AND THAT IS A LIFE OR DEATH SITUATION. WE KNOW ABOUT THE PUBLIC SAFETY PROBLEMS THAT HAPPENED WHEN THE LIGHTS GO OUT. AND UNTIL PEOPLE HAVE BEEN IN A BLACKOUT NOT JUST THESE BUT BLACKOUTS IN GENERAL. IT CREATES HUGE PUBLIC SAFETY CHALLENGES IN PEOPLE'S OWN HOMES. BUT ALSO IN THE COMMUNITY OR FOR TRAFFIC OR FOR PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES A HUGE PROBLEM- IT CREATES A HUGE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS WHEN BUSINESSES. CLOSE DOWN SMALL BUSINESSES BIG BUSINESSES AND FOR MANY SMALL BUSINESSES IN PARTICULAR CLOSING DOWN FOR THREE OR FOUR DAYS. THAT COULD BE WHAT PUSHES YOU- INTO BANKRUPTCY. MANY THESE BUSINESSES AE OPERATING ON SMALL MARGINS THEY HAVE NO MARGIN FOR ERROR AND WE'RE SHUTTING THEM DOWN AND WE KNOW BECAUSE THAT I'VE HEARD FROM BUSINESSES IN MY DISTRICT HER TERRIFIED THAT THE AND THEIR INSURANCE DOESN'T EVEN COVER. THE LOST. PROFITS ARE LOST REVENUES FROM THESE BLACKOUTS BECAUSE IT WAS NOT UNEXPECTED QUOTE ON QUOTE BECAUSE THEY GOT TWENTY FOUR OR FORTY EIGHT HOURS NOTICE. IT'S A HUGE HARDSHIP FOR FAMILIES WHEN PEOPLE CAN'T EITHER CAN'T GO TO WORK AND CAN EARN A LIVING BECAUSE YOU'RE BUSINESSES SHUT DOWN. OR YOU HAVE TO STAY HOME BECAUSE YOUR KIDS SCHOOL IS SHUT DOWN BECAUSE IT HAS NO POWER AND SO YOU CAN GO TO WORK BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO STAY HOME WITH YOUR KIDS. WE KNOW THAT FOR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS. THE US TOMORROW SMALL NOBLE COMMUNITIES- IT IS A MAJOR HARDSHIP. MISSING A FEW DAYS A WORK- IS A HUGE FINANCIAL HARDSHIP. BUT LOSING ALL THE CONTENTS OF YOUR REFRIGERATOR FOR MANY OF US WE HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT. I DON'T LIKE IT BUT I'M GONNA GO SHOPPING FOR MORE FOOD. FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE YOU LOSE YOUR REFRIGERATOR CONTENTS. THAT'S YOUR FOOD FOR THE MONTH. AND SO THESE ARE HUGE COST AND RIGHT NOW THE UTILITIES DO NOT HAVE TO TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT I COMMAND GOVERNOR NEW SOME FOR- FOR BADGERING. SUCCESSFULLY THE TILL- YOU NEED TO PAY SOME MONEY I THINK IT WAS A HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT'S GREAT BUT WE NEED TO HAVE A SYSTEM IN PLACE SO THAT PEOPLE CAN GET COMPENSATION. AND SO SB THREE SEVENTY EIGHT TRIES TO FORCE THE UTILITIES TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL THESE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS. BY ALLOWING PEOPLE TO SEE COMPENSATION FOR DAMAGES- DOT WILL BE DONE THROUGH THE CPUC- AND PURSUING TOOK A MEMO WE TOOK FROM THE COMMITTEE. WE'RE GIVING THE CPC FLEXIBILITY ABOUT SETTING UP THAT SYSTEM AND WHAT EXACTLY IS COMPENSATED SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO MICROMANAGE TO. THE CPC WILL HAVE SOME LATITUDE TO SET UP- THAT- THAT SYSTEM. ON IT IN ADDITION- WILL- THERE WILL BE AN HOURLY FEE WHICH WE'VE SCALED BACK UNDER THE COMMITTEES MEMBERS WITH CUT IN HALF. AND IT WILL ONLY APPLY IF THE CPC DETERMINES THAT THE BLACKOUT WAS UNREASONABLE- SO WE SCALE THAT BACK I THINK IN IN AN APPROPRIATE WAY- WE'VE TAKEN OUT. **** AND ABOUT. PROHIBITING THE UTILITIES FROM LOBBYING AGAINST ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF ENERGY- LIKE PUBLIC POWER OR DVRS- ALTHOUGH I- CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THAT I THINK IT'S OUTRAGEOUS. THAT THE UTILITIES HAVE I CAN PUT A STRANGLEHOLD FOR MANY YEARS ON ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF ENERGY- WE WERE HOT WE WERE WILLING TO TAKE THAT OUT BECAUSE THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT. IDEA I COULD PROBABLY BERKELEY BE ITS OWN- BUILT ON THE LEGISLATION. ALSO REQUIRES BETTER DITA. SO THAT WE KNOW A. SAFI WHAT'S HAPPENING- WITH THESE OF BLACKOUTS- AND BECAUSE I JUST THINK THAT THIS IS A GOOD. APPROACH AND AGAIN UNDERSTANDING IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS- AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR BY BOAT. FOUGHT WITH ME TODAY- ARE- PATRICIA ROMERO- AUGUST RIVAS OF THE FOOD BANK OF CAUGHT CONTRA COSTA AND SOLANO COUNTY. AND WILL ABRAMS OWNER OF ONE OR WE CONSULTING- AND ALSO HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS- IS A I'VE BEEN A CHIANG WITH THE CITY OF SAN JOSE WHICH IS OUR SPONSOR OF THIS LEGISLATION THANK YOU. YEAH AND THE CLOSER. HELLO MY NAME IS BUT THREE SEVERAL MADDOG WAS FEVERS SOME FROM VALLEJO CALIFORNIA- AND I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHAT I EXPERIENCED ON THE POWER SHUT OFF- I DID EXPERIENCE THE POWER SET OFF SITE WAS OUT OF POWER FOR ABOUT FOUR AND A HALF DAYS ON LOST. ALL THE CONTENTS OF MY FREE TRADER AND FREEZER- AND- JUST AS A LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY ABOUT MYSELF I'M ON A FIXED INCOME I'M ON SOCIAL SECURITY RETIREMENT AND THAT'S MY ONLY FORM OF INCOME. FOR ME TO GO OUT AND BUY GROCERIES AFTER I'VE LOST EVERYTHING AND AFTER I'VE PAID FOR GROCERIES FOR THE MONTH. BECAME A COMPLETE. ON ME IT WAS A HARDSHIP ON ME- IT WITHOUT THE HELP OF THE FOOD BANK WHICH I AM ALSO AN ADVOCATE FOR THE FOOD BANK. WITHOUT THE HELP FROM THE FOOD BANK I WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SURVIVE. I HAVE OLD ELDERLY PARENTS THAT LIVE ABOUT FOUR AND A HALF BLOCKS AWAY FROM ME FROM UP IN AMERICAN CANYON MY MOM IS ON INSULIN HER INSULIN HAS TO BE REFRIGERATED. SO WHEN I LOST MY POWER FIRST OF ALL. P. GINNY HAD NOTIFIED VIA THE- TV THAT THEY WRE GOING TO BE POWER OUTAGES. THE FIRST POWER OUTAGE IN THE BEGINNING OF NORTH OF OCTOBER I WAS IT. I DIDN'T GET A HIT BY THOSE. IT WAS THE SECOND ONE WHERE I WAS OUT FOR LIKE I SAID FOUR AND A HALF DAYS. I GOT. AS SOON AS MY POWER WENT OUT I GOT A NOTIFICATION. THAT WAS MY NOTIFICATION YOUR POWERS OUT A YEAH I KNOW. IF I COULD SEE I HAVE NO NO LIGHT IN THE HOUSE- AND I DID I WAS ABLE TO CONTACT PGD AFTER IT CAME BACK ON IT I WAS ABLE TO CONTACT AND ASKED THEM ABOUT ANY TYPE OF REIMBURSEMENT AND THEY TOLD ME. THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET THE REIMBURSEMENT WERE THE ONES FROM THE ADDITIONAL POWDER HOUR OUTAGE BECAUSE THEIR WEBSITE WAS DOWN AND THEY COULDN'T NOTIFY PEOPLE AND I GOT MY NOTIFICATION. WELL I GOT IT THE DAY I GOT I GOT HIT OKAY- AND I HAVE TO. FIGURE OUT WHAT AM I GOING TO DO TO SAVE MY CONTENT SO I COULDN'T FIND ANY PLACE THAT HAD ICE IN MY COMMUNITY I HAD TO DRIVE OUT TO FAIRFIELD TO GET ICE TO PUT MY- MY FOOD. IN ICE CHESTS SO I CAN HAVE YOU KNOW I CAN HAVE MY FOOD STATE AND UNFORTUNATELY THE SECOND DAY- SO I WAS ABLE TO GET TWENTY BAG THE ICE I SHARED SOME WITH MY PARENTS SHARE SOME WITH WITH MYSELF AND A COUPLE OF NEIGHBORS THAT ARE ELDERLY GAVE THEM SOME ICE. BUT THE SECOND DAY WHEN THERE WAS NO MORE ICE I WAS LIKE OKAY GONNA LOSE AT ALL SO I STARTED I HAVE A GAS STOVE SO I WAS ABLE TO COOK ON TOP OF MY GUESS SO I COULD WHAT I COULD COOK AND I FELT A COUPLE PEOPLE. YOU KNOW MY NEIGHBORHOOD THAT HAD ELECTRIC HAD ELECTRIC APPLIANCES AND THEN THE REST OF THE FOOD WENT SO NOW HERE I AM THE POWERS BACK ON I HAVE TO GO TO THE GROCERY STORE. AND I'VE GOT TO BUY GROCERIES AND I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY. SO WHAT DO YOU DO. YOU KNOW WHAT DO YOU DO AND THEN AFTER I STARTED THINKING ABOUT. OKAY WHAT CAN I DO TO PREVENT THIS WELL I COULD GET A GENERATOR BUT I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY FOR THAT EITHER SO- PEOPLE THEY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO BUY A GENERATOR SO THEY COULD SAVE THE FOOD THAT THEY PAID THAT THEY PAID FOR. WHAT DO YOU DO. AND ALSO I HAVE AND I STARTED THINKING AGAIN OKAY WHAT DO I DO IN THE FUTURE I STARTED REALIZING IN MY HOME MY SMOKE DETECTORS ARE. EAST WIRED INTO MY HOUSE SO DURING THAT TIME FRAME HAD. THERE BEEN A FIRE IN MY HOME I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN- NOTIFIED THROUGH MY FIRED MY SMOKE DETECTORS BECAUSE THEY'RE ELECTED BASED SO THAT MEANS OKAY I NEED A GENERATOR NOW I NEED TO GO OUT AND BUY SMOKE DETECTORS WHICH I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY FOR AS WELL AS GROCERIES. SO IT'S THAT'S HOW IT'S HIT ME YOU KNOW EN. I CAN'T I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN AFFORD TO GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO IN THE NEXT ONE. THANK YOU MA'AM THANK YOU. THANK YOU. DID YOU HAVE ANY OTHER IT SIR. OUR THANKS. WILLIE BROWN'S- OWNER OF ONE ARE WE- PRIOR TO THE FIRES OF TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN- MY CONSULTING SERVICES FOCUSED ON TELECOM AND TECH- SINCE RUNNING FROM THE FLAMES IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN. AND BE MOVING VERY COGNIZANT OF THE ISSUES THAT SURROUND THIS IVORY FOCUSED. MY EFFORTS ON- TRYING TO HELP WHERE I CAN. IN TERMS OF THE PATH FORWARD IN RECOVERY AND RESILIENCY- THESE POWER SHUT OFFS- HAVE LARGELY AFFECTED BUSINESSES IN THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY- YOU'LL SHIFTING. THE RISKS. OF A WILDFIRE FROM UTILITIES TO. INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESSES- IS NOT. THE RIGHT WAY TO PROCEED- I THINK THAT THERE ARE MANY BUSINESSES WHO ARE STRUGGLING- FOR MYSELF I LOST POWER SIX TIMES- I DO LIVE IN THE WILD LIFE FOR URBAN INTERFACE BUT I THINK ONE OF THE- MISS NUMBERS ABOUT THAT IS THAT YOU THINK ABOUT. THE WILDLIFE FOR INTERVENTION IT WILDLIFE INNER. URBAN HER FACE. AS IF IT'S OFF INTO THE WILDERNESS. I LIVE IN SANTA ROSA. SO PRETTY. PRETTY AYE SUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA. AND LOST POWER SIX TIMES- KIDS OUT OF SCHOOL. FOR TWO AND A HALF WEEKS. AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW I'M GONNA- ORGANIZE MY WORK DAY. AROUND THAT. AND IN. IN RESPONSE TO THAT TOO AND- DAYS OF MISS SCHOOL- THEY GET HALF DAY. OF IT BACK FOR. THAT TIME UP- BUSINESSES ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND GENERATORS. SHIFTING ARE RISKS. FROM UTILITIES WHO ARE THE EXPERTS IN THIS TO. VISUAL BUSINESSES TO FIRE UP. THE RAIDERS AND FIGURE OUT ALL THOSE THINGS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR BUSINESSES ARE. EVEN THOUGH COMMUNITIES ARE SAFE. IS NOT NECESSARILY. A FOR THE PUBLIC. I'M I WOULD SAY THAT PART OF WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING IT- THROUGH THIS IS TRYING TO REACH OUT TO OTHER BUSINESS OWNERS TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS. ARE EVER CENTER IS A IS A LARGE RETAIL OPERATION IN SANTA ROSA- I KNOW THE OWNERS OF UPPER CENTER AND THEY HAVE EXPRESSED TO ME THAT THESE POWER SHUT OFFS COSTS THEM. A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS DURING THIS- SHUT OFF TIME- AND THEY HAD THEIR POWER ON. AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT SO MANY PEOPLE EVACUATED. AND SO MANY PEOPLE I CHOSE TO STAY AT HOME BECAUSE OF- THE SITUATION THAT THEY LOST SIGNIFICANT REVENUE. SO WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS NOT JUST FOR THOSE WHO LOSE POWER BUT FOR THOSE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE POWER STILL ON AND THE EFFECTS OF THAT IN THE COMMUNITY- I WOULD SAY IF I CAN'T VERY QUICKLY- THAT ARE THROUGH THE CPUC. IN MIND JOINT ERROR- AND IN THE PRECEDING RELATED TO THE POWER SHUT OFF THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT CAN BE DONE AND I THINK THE BIG THING THAT. BILL DOES IN THAT I SUPPORT IS THAT THE UTILITIES FIND SHEL SUCCESS. NEEDS TO BE TIED TO OUR SUCCESS. AND THAT HAS BEEN LARGELY MISSING FROM THE EQUATION. AND ALTHOUGH THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT HOW UTILITIES ARE LOOKING OUT FOR PUBLIC INTERESTS. AND LESS IT IS TIED TO THEIR BOTTOM LINE INTERESTS. IT WON'T HAVE A PATH FORWARD- I JUST WANTED TO ALSO STATE THAT I'M ALSO CLAIM IT IN THE P. JEANNIE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING- AND I KNOW MANY HAVE FOCUSED ON THAT AS- PLEASE FOR RESTRUCTURING PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC THAT IS NOT OCCURRING THERE- AND THE VOICE OF THE PUBLIC IN THAT PROCEEDING I'VE- BEEN TRYING TO ARGUE IN FAVOR. OF THE GOVERNOR'S LETTER AND THE STRONG SENTIMENT THAT HE EXPRESSED- IN THAT PROCEEDING OUT TO MAKE SURE THAT P. GENIES RESTRUCTURED UNFORTUNATELY THE LARGE FINANCIAL INTERESTS THAT MAKE UP THE PARTIES IN THAT ROOM ARE PUSHING AGAINST THAT. AND I WOULD JUST URGE- EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM TO PLEASE SUPPORT THAT EFFORT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PUBLIC INTERESTS ARE ALSO REPRESENTED THERE- I WON'T GO INTO DETAIL BUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS IN. THE RSA THEIR STRUCTURE A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT THAT PUSH US IN ABSOLUTELY THE WRONG DIRECTION AND GIVEN THE DEADLINE THAT'S FAST APPROACHING IT IS A CONCERN ALL OF THESE ISSUES RELATE AND HEART WENT OFF TOPIC I APOLOGIZE. BUT THE POINT IS ALL OF THESE ISSUES RELATE LIKE YOU SIR THANK YOU DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT.

GOT TO GO UP THE- PLEASE IF YOU CAN CLEAR SPACE FOR THIS. MISTER CHAIRMAN THE MEMBER SCOTT WHAT SHOULD BE AT THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES. FIRST AND FOREMOST I LIKE TO THINK THE COMEDIAN THE AUTHOR- THE MINUTES THAT WERE TAKEN. WERE I THINK ARE VERY RESPONSIBLE AND MOVED TO BUILD A MUCH BETTER DIRECTION. ON THE LAST PIECE OF THE BILL THAT WAS THE TOPIC IN THE DISCUSSION. WE'RE WAITING TO SEE WHAT COMES FROM THIS COMMITTEE IN THE FORM OF ANY AMENDMENTS BUT- WE STILL HAVE. SOME SERIOUS CONCERNS. FIRST AND FOREMOST. IT SEEKS TO PLACE NEW PENALTIES FINANCIAL DISINCENTIVES TO WE BELIEVE ACTING RESPONSIBLE- WIN THE P. YOU SEE HAS STILL NOT EVEN ISSUE RULES. YOU SHOULD BE FIGHTING MICHAEL PICKER RIGHT NOW. IT'S BEEN A YEAR AND A HALF THERE'S NO RULES THEY HAVE AN ADOPTED A RULE PACKAGE YET ON WHAT THE STANDARDS AND PROTOCOLS FOR DOING A SHUT OFF BE THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS. THAT SHOULD BE DEALT WITH BEFORE YOU START DEALING WITH THE CONSEQUENCES FOR NOT FOLLOWING THE RULES THAT HAVE NOT EVEN BEEN SET YET. AND THEN SECONDLY MY I'M A THIRD GENERATION SONOMA COUNTY IT I HAD. NUMEROUS FAMILY MEMBERS THAT WERE EVACUATED IN THIS LAST FIRES OF THE COUNTY FOR UP TO EIGHT DAYS. I WOULD TELL YOU IF YOU ASKED ANY OF THEM WOULD YOU RATHER BE. WITHOUT POWER FOR FIVE OR SIX DAYS. OR WITHOUT SHELTER BECAUSE OF FIRES IS BARRELING DOWN ON YOU THEY WOULD TO A PERSON SAY I'D RATHER HAVE SHELTER SO WE WILL CAUTIOUSLY WATCH WHAT COMES OUR COMMITTEE TODAY CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR BUT- WE DON'T THINK THE BILL'S STANCE. TODAY IS READY TO BE PASSED THANKS. ADAM SMITH SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON RESPECTFULLY OPPOSING SB THREE SEVENTY EIGHT- ESSIE RECOGNIZES THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF SO DISRUPTIVE THEY CAN BE A HARDSHIP ESPECIALLY IF I'M PREPARED. SO WE STRIVE TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OUR CUSTOMERS AND COMMUNITIES WE DO NOT MAKE THE DECISION TO POWER DOWN LIGHTLY. AND WHEN WE DO POWER DOWN WE DO IT IN A VERY TARGETED WAY THANKS TO YEARS OF INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE HELPED TO SECTION LIES OUR GRID. WHEN WE CONDUCT A P. S. P. S. OF AND IT SERVES A VERY VITAL PURPOSE IT'S NECESSARY TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S FROM CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. IN FACT S. C. PATROLS CONDUCTED AFTER THE OCTOBER TWENTY NINETEEN SHUT OFFS. FOUND SEVERAL INSTANCES OF EQUIPMENT DAMAGE AND TREE BRANCHES CONTACTING PARALYZES THE PUBLIC REPORT I'M HOLDING UP AND HAVING DESCENDED TO YOUR OFFICES. JUST FOR A TEN DAY WINDOW IN OCTOBER THAT HIGHLIGHTS BROKEN CROSS ARMS FOUND BY OUR OUR CREWS- WIND THAT BLEW ON OWNING INTO A SERVICE LINE TREES IN THE LINES REMOVED WE DID. BUT THEY DIDN'T AND THAT'S PRECISELY BECAUSE SCA EMPLOYEES DE ENERGIZED THOSE LINES PREEMPTIVELY AND TOOK THE TIME TO REPAIR THEM SAFELY. WE'VE SPENT THE LAST TWO YEARS AS A STATE DEFINING IN SHAPING WHAT PRUDENT UTILITY OPERATIONS SHOULD LOOK LIKE IN THIS ERA OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND RISING WILDFIRE RISK. SB NINE A ONE ADDRESSED IT THE NINE A ONE COMMISSION ADDRESSED IT AB TEN FIFTY FOUR ADDRESSED IT. IS I THINK MISTER WEST MENTIONED ONGOING PC PROCEEDINGS AND RULE MAKINGS AND GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS NOW WE HAVE A BILL WITH SB THREE SEVENTY EIGHT. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE AMENDMENTS IMPRINT BUT AS IT LOOKS TODAY WE THINK WOULD FIND UTILITIES FOR ACTING PRUDENTLY. EVEN WITH THE CONCEPTUAL COMMITTEE AMEND. HE THINKS THAT THE WRONG. DESTRUCTION PENALIZES US WHEN WE DO THE RIGHT THING TO KEEP THE PUBLIC SAFE RESPECTFULLY URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU FOR. SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING DIANA FLEMING'S ON BEHALF OF PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY WE ALSO OPPOSE.

JEANNIE WE'VE YOU DE ENERGIES ATION FOR PUBLIC SAFETY IS BUT ONE IS SHORT TERM SOLUTION TO PROTECT OUR CUSTOMERS AND COMMUNITIES. P. GENIE IS WORKING HRD EVERY DAY TO IMPLEMENT ADDITIONAL LONG TERM SOLUTIONS TO REDUCE THE SIZE THE DURATION AND FREQUENCY OF POWER SHUT OFF TO MINIMIZE IMPACTS ON OUR CUSTOMERS. A WE WILL REVIEW THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WHEN THEY'RE PRINT WE BELIEVE THEY ARE MOVING IN A BETTER DIRECTION WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION. MISTER CHAIR NUMBER STILL ANY HUNTER ON BEHALF OF THE COURT WE WERE IN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION. A RELATIVE TO THE SECTION TWO OF THE BILL WHICH NOW I UNDERSTAND HAS BEEN REMOVED PER THE COMMITTEE- I MINUTES.

FOR THOSE YOU HAVE DISTRICTS IN WHICH THEIR POWER SHUT OFF HAVE OCCURRED- IT IS A BIG PROBLEM. AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE OUR MEMBERS ARE OUT. RECEIVING SOME OF THE PROBLEMS OR THE FEEDBACK IS A POLITE TERM. IT'S REALLY ABUSE- AND IT WE HAD A COUPLE INSTANCES OF ACTUAL SALT.

UC WE'VE GOT A GOVERNOR HASN'T TAKEN A POSITION WE'VE GOT OF OTHERS OUR OWN SENATE TASK FORCE WORKING GROUP SOME OF WHOM ARE HERE TODAY IN THIS COMMITTEE WHO HAVE YET TO COME FORWARD IN THIS DEAL. WE HAVE- YOU KNOW THIS LARGER DYNAMIC IT'S THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM AND I YOU KNOW I JUST MENTIONED BECAUSE I ALWAYS MENTION THE FOR THE ROOM WHICH IS THE WHOLE ISSUE OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION AND THEY'RE NOT JUST THE ISSUE OF THEOBVIOUS SAFETY RISK IN THE DENERVATION THAT IDEA WAS BUSTED MISSED WHICH IN TERMS OF. PEOPLE AND HOW THEIR FAMILY LIKE FORCES HAVING SOMEONE CAN BE NO QUESTIONS DIFFICULT BUT THE WHOLE LARGER DYNAMIC OF WE'RE TRYING TO FIND A WORK AROUND THIS BIG. ISSUE OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THE SAFETY RISK AND ALL THOSE OTHER THINGS ARE CRITICAL.

WITH CHAIR THE COMMITTEE IS IMPORTANT HERE MAYBE WE CAN COME TO SOME CONCLUSIONS PART OF ALL THE PARTIES. I JUST WANT TO FRAME OUT THE LARGER CONTEXT AND PUT THAT INTO THE- THE RECORD BEFORE I. VOTED ON THANK YOU SO MUCH MISS. EXTRA CENTER RIGHT FOR. THANK YOU AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS COMMITMENT TO TRYING TO SOLVE ISSUE BUT A ISSUE THAT. THE LEGISLATURE CREATED SHUT OFFS ARE NOTHING NEW- I SPENT. TWELVE YEARS OF MY LIFE WORKING FOR UTILITY COMPANY AND WE RE TOOLING ROUTINELY SHUT OFF POWER. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE TODAY IS THERE LONGER AND LARGER AREAS BUT- TO REPAIR INFRASTRUCTURE TO. LET YOU SEE OB MAKE UPGRADES WE SHUT THE POWER OFF ON A REGULAR BASIS AND I WAS CHALLENGE MANY TIMES YOU GO KNOCK ON DOORS AND HAND OUT VOTE VOUCHERS FOR FOOD. TO THE PORTS OF COMMUNITIES WHEN WE MANAGED TO TURN ON SANTA MONICA BEVERLY HILLS A WHOLE LOT QUICKER THAN WE MANAGED TO TURN ON. COMPTON AND THE COMMUNITIES SUCH AS AS AS WE'RE HERE TODAY BECAUSE THIS LEGISLATURE REQUIRE PS PS. NOT A SINGLE UTILITY WHETHER IT'S INVESTOR OWNED OR PUBLIC ALL WALK IN HERE SEE AND YOU KNOW SOMETHING WE WANT TO SHUT OFF POWER TO OUR CUSTOMERS. BUT WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED IN THE LAST YEAR ASKS WHERE THEY SHUT OFF POWER THERE WAS CLEAR CHALLENGES TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE JUST LIKE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON- YOU SHARED A FEW MINUTES AGO THERE WERE BRANCHES IN THE LINES. THERE WERE. TREES THEY WERE THE BRAVE PALM FRONDS OR WHEN THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES IN A WINDSTORM TWO EIGHT YOU TILTED UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE BUT A LOT OF WHAT PEOPLE FAIL TO UNDERSTAND IS. MANY TIMES THOSE TREES ARE THERE BECAUSE. PRETTY AND THE UTILITY CAN ACCESS AND WE SHOULD OF FOUR DEAD UTILITIES BETTER ACCESS TO. ENTERTHESE PROPERTIES BACK MUCH OF ITS STATE AND FEDERAL LANDS THAT WE CAN'T THEY CAN'T GET ON I SHOULD SAY- TO MAINTAIN AND CUT BACK THE TREES. AND DEBRIS TO HELP PREVENT THIS BUT AGAIN. THE COMMUNITY. AS A WHOLE. LOSES FAITH AND LEGISLATORS WHEN WE ASK FOR SOMETHING AND THEN A COMPANY OR INDUSTRY FOLLOWS EXACTLY WHAT WE LEGISLATIVE THEM TO DO AND NOW THEY'RE THE BAD GUYS. THIS WILL BE PASSED ON THE RATE PAYERS NO MATTER HIGH WE FRAME IT REPAIRS AT THE END OF THE DAY. WILL ALWAYS PAY FOR ANY OF THIS. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF- SOONER ARTS BURKE I RESPECT HIS COMMENT BECAUSE HE IS THE ONLY ONE HERE. THAT WAS LATER AND THIS AND THIS IS TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND ONE I ENERGY CRISIS THAT WAS CREATED BY HOME THE LEGISLATURE AGAIN MY BAD POLICY IN THE LATE EIGHTIES. ASSN FOR DEREGULATION OF THE IMAGE- UTILITY SECTOR AND WE'RE GOING TO DO IT AGAIN FOLKS WERE SETTING THE TABLE UP FOR ANOTHER ENERGY CRISIS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR THAT REASON. I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS MERGER TODAY. US UNDER A STERN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR. BACK IN SEPTEMBER JUMPING INTO THE FRAY HERE WITH ALL THE REST OF US WHO ARE GOING THROUGH THE FIGHT- WE HAD WE DIDN'T LOSE AS MANY HOMES TO THE POWER OUTAGES AS THEY DID IN THE NORTH BUT- IT. IT SQUARELY CENTERED IN THIS SORT OF IN MY DISTRICT ACTUALLY I MEAN IN TERMS OF THE BALK AT THE CUSTOMER'S HIT THROUGH OCTOBER- AND ALL THE WAY UP TO MY WEDDING. BUT IT DIDN'T SHUT OFF MY ENTIRE WEDDING SO THAT WAS GOOD- BUT LATE GRANDMOTHER MEANWHILE SIT IN THE DARK FOR WEEKS ON END. THANK GOD SHE'S WE GOT A LINE TO HER WE WENT AND FOUNDER AND EVACUATED HERE AND GOT HER MEDICINE INTO A FREE AGENT TODAY ACTUALLY GENERATORS ON IT. AND MY FAMILY CAN AFFORD TO PUT ONE IN THERE AND A LOT OF FAMILIES CAN'T. AND THERE'S A LOT OF WORKING PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE UPSIDE DOWN STILL BECAUSE OF THIS SO ONE QUESTION I HAD JUST AS A TECHNICAL MATTER IS WHAT HAPPENS TO. WOULD YOU ANTICIPATE HAVING TO THE PENALTIES. THEM THESE THAT ARE COLLECTED THAT THE BILL. IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT OF THE BILL SPEAKS TO. WILL ACTUALLY GO TO MITIGATE THE HARM TO. THOSE IMPACTED OR NOT- WANT TO TOUCH ON THAT YEP ISSUE RIGHT RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE.% DEDICATION FOR THE FUNDS THAT IS ABSOLUTELY A TOPIC. WERE WILLING TO ENGAGE ON- YOU KNOW OUR HOPE WE THIS IS- ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE WE HOPE IF YOU NEVER GETS COLLECTED. RIGHT WE WANNA SORT OF INCENTIVIZE THE RIGHT BEHAVIOR AND MY HOPE IS THAT IT. OR IF IT DOES GET COLLECTED THAT IT'S- THE MINIMUMS THAT'S MY HOPE WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE INCENTIVES- BUT WE'RE OPEN TO A CONVERSATION ABOUT. WHAT THE BEST USE OF THOSE FUNDS ARE. UNDERSTANDING THAT WE HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING. HELLO LARGE MALL IT WILL BE. SO SHE THAT OPEN IS THAT'LL BE IMPORTANT FOR ME DOWN THE HOME STRETCH OF THE BILL MAKES IT OUT BECAUSE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT AT LEAST EDISON'S PROCESS THAT I FAR AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND THEY CAN CLARIFY BUT I THINK THERE'S A CLAIMS PROCESS FOR- HOMEOWNERS. I GUESS HEALTH AND. DIRECT HARDSHIP BUT NOT FOR BUSINESS LOSSES SO TO THE CHAMBERS POINTER THE LARGER IN OF THE HOTELS THAT WENT UNDER WE HAVE IN A CITY SMALL CITRUS GROWER LOST TWO MILLION DOLLARS NOW HE'S BELLY UP RIGHT SO THOSE INDUSTRIES I THINK I'VE BEEN LEFT BEHIND FROM THE CLAIMS PROCESS IF I'M NOT RIGHT I'M HAPPY TO BE CORRECTED THERE SO THAT'LL BE IMPORTANT FOR FUTURE SUPPORT AND ONE OTHER THING I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT WAS. BASHING WITH THE- WITH SENATOR DODD'S ONE SIXTY SEVEN FROM LAST YEAR WHICH I THINK. IT IS ESTABLISHED THIS NEED FOR UNIFORM PROTOCOL- I THINK THAT THAT WAS IN YOUR BILL IT ALSO I TO DO WITH SORT OF DEALING WITH THOSE WHO MAY BE MEDICALLY. AS A MEDICALLY VULNERABLE BUT SO HOW DO YOU SEE THE IN THE PROCESS IS DOVE TAILING I NOTE UC'S GOING THROUGH THEIR AFTER ACTION REPORT RIGHT NOW. THEY'LL MAKE THEIR OWN FINDINGS DO THEY HAVE EXISTING FINE AUTHORITY THEY CAN USE FOR INSTANCE IF THEY FOUND THE LAST ROUND OF THEM TO BE IMPRUDENT OR DOES DO WE DO WE NEED THIS. TO GIVE THEM THAT I THINK WE DO NEED THIS AND I KNOW THE CEBU CITY AND CENTER HERTZBERG ALSO REYES IS HAS IT OPEN PROCEEDING NOW- ON. SOME OF THE STANDARDS FOR PS- YESES. AND I AND THE BILL WILL TIE IN TO THAT IN TERMS OF FINDING WHAT WHAT WHETHER THE YES YES WAS. OF THE BLACKOUT WAS REASONABLE OR UNREASONABLE- ONE THING I WILL SAY IS I AGREE WITH CENTER HERTZBERG THERE A LOT OF MOVING PARTS HERE AT CPAP PROCEEDING- OUR OWN WORK HERE IN THE SENATE- YES THE GOVERNOR HAS NOT. YOU KNOW FULLY WAIT AND- AND I KNOW. ALL OF THESE THINGS WILL INTERPLAY IN THIS BILL. IF IT'S KIDS MOVIE AND ITS SUCCESSFUL- INTO YOU KNOW THE END OF AUGUST. SO THIS IS GOING TO PLAN TO A LOT. BUT HE WILL WAY BROADLY OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR I WOULD EXPECT THEM TO WEIGH IN EARLY IN THE PROCESS- AND OUR OWN WORKING GROUP I'M SURE WE'LL DO THAT. I WAS ALREADY DOING FANTASTIC AT WORK- AND THE CPC SO WE'LL HAVE. PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS BILL AS IT MOVES. MESHES AND COMPLIMENTS EVERYTHING ELSE IS HAPPENING THAT'S WHY I SAY IT IS A- IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS NOT IN A NEGATIVE WAY BUT IN A WAY TO THE BROADER. PICTURE AND VERY PLUGGED INTO THAT AND WILL REMAIN. I APPRECIATE ALL THAT I DON'T OVER PROMISE TO THE FOLKS BACK HOME. WHO ARE WAITING THEY PROBABLY WON'T GIVE THEM RELIEF FOR. THE LAST INCIDENT IS WHAT I'M HERE IN. I GUESS I'M ASKING THE TECHNICAL MATTER. I DON'T KNOW WHO CAN ANSWER THIS BUT LIKE. CAN IF THE IF THE UTILITIES EITHER P. JUNIOR ES DE WERE IMPRUDENT. IN LAST FALL'S YES PS IS CAN A FINE. I'M UNDER EXISTING LAW. E. S. I'M SEEING NOW YEAH YES SIR INSTEAD OF HOW MUCH THAT FINE IS THAT MORE WELL THIS IS A WE'RE PUTTING SOME STRUCTURE- STRUCTURE AROUND THAT AROUND THE AND THE COMPENSATION AS WELL THE CONVERSATION FRANKLY THE MORE IMPORTANT A PIECE OF IT MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE CAN GET COMPENSATION AND JUST- I'VE BEEN INFORMED THAT THERE THERE'S AN OPEN. PROCEEDING AGAINST P. JEANNIE RIGHT NOW. OKAY THAT ON THAT ON THAT ISSUE YEAH SO THAT'S THE ONLY THING I JUST WANT CLARITY ON GOING FORWARD FROM BOTH COMMITTEE AN AUTHOR IS. I KNOW THAT. THERE'S OF REASONABLENESS OR A FINDING OF UNDER REASONABLENESS REQUIREMENT NOW IN THE MEN'S YOU TOOK. THAT PRUDENT SEE DETERMINATIONS GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE I DON'T I DON'T WANT A SITUATION WHERE THE I STILL THINK AND EVERYONE CAN MONEY MORNING QUARTERBACK IT BUT WE'LL SEE. WHICH WAS CATASTROPHIC THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE REGION I WORK FOR. WE HAD A BUNCH OF TOWN HALLS BEFORE THAT WERE EVERYONE IS YELLING AT S. C. E. DON'T SHUT OFF THE POWER. AND ALL OUR MAYORS AND I LOVE THE MAYOR'S I WORK FOR AND ALL OF YOU BACK HOME BUT THAT PUBLIC PRESSURE I STILL THINK. AT MADE HIM HESITATE. AND THAT HESITATION. MAY VERY WELL TRIGGERED WHAT BURN MY HOUSE DOWN IN A LOT OF PEOPLE AND YOU KNOW. IT'S SOME PEOPLE CAN AFFORD TO RECOVER SOME PEOPLE CAN'T THANKS SO I WOULD JUST SAY I'LL BE VOTING FOR THE BILL TODAY BUT. WORKING OUT THAT. THAT PRUDENT SEE DETERMINATION WILL BE REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE THAT IN PRINT RIGHT NOW DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING FOR US. WE'RE WERE YOU WORKING THE LANGUAGE IS NOT IMPRINT CARLTON- JUST BECAUSE I HEARD THE TERM JUST CAUSES NO FACTOR CAN YOU JUST IF YOU HAVE AN ALBINO PARTING IT'S ABOUT REASONABLENESS WHICH WILL DETERMINE BY. BECAUSE THEY'RE THE BINDING ALL OF THAT NOW OKAY AND SO WE'RE SORT OF PLAYING INTO THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT AND WE'RE GIVING US TO SEE IF YOU SEE AN INTERVIEW YES THEY AN PUNISH UTILITIES NOW. THE QUERY HOW THAT'S WORKED IN THE PAST AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO STRUCTURE IT A LITTLE MORE FOR THE COMMISSION SO IT'S NOT JUST THE NEBULOUS. WE SORT OF THING YOU DID SOMETHING WRONG WE DON'T KNOW WE CAN FIND YOU A LOT OR A LITTLE- THERE HAS NOT BEEN ENOUGH ACCOUNTABILITY- IN THE PAST FOR THE UTILITIES PARTICULARLY FOR P. JEANNIE- AND WE'RE TRYING TO PUT SOME MORE STRUCTURE IN PLACE. YEAH BUT THE WORKING POOR WE WELCOME YOUR SPECIFIC FEEDBACK TO I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO DIRECT HAS BEEN A REALLY GOING TO SENATOR RUBIO NOTHING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I JUST WANNA OPENED UP I THINK IN THE AUTHOR WE'VE SAT DOWN WE'VE DISCUSSED ALL THE ISSUES THAT I HALF WITH THE BILL AND DODD THE ONE THING THAT I ALWAYS SAY IS I APPRECIATE WHEN AUTHORS ARE WANTING TO SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT AS SOME OF THE CONCERNS AND MEDICAID AMEND HE'S ALREADY DONE A GREAT JOB OF WORKING WITH VANDALS ISSUES. BUT THE ONE CONCERN THAT I SHARE IS THAT TO FOR ME NUMBER ONE IS OP PROTECTING LIVES AND THAT HAS A TEN SEE THAT- MR STERN SPOKE ABOUT IS REALLY LOOK AS ME PAUSE. CAN NOW TELL WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS DOES NOT BECOME CATASTROPHIC AND SO WHEN WE HALF THE UTILITY COMPANIES. THINKING TWICE AND NOT ACTING BECAUSE YOU'RE SO CONCERNED A BODY TO THE FEES OR NOT HAVING ENOUGH TIME TO GO OUT AND INSPECT THE LINES- I KNOW ALL IN YOUR BILL IT. DISCUSSES EVERY HOUR ON THE HOUR PENALTIES. AND I WORRY ABOUT TRYING TO DO IT WITHIN THAT ONE HOUR SO THEY DON'T GO INTO A SECOND OUR AND- AND SO FOR ME SAY FEAR IS A BIG CONCERN I'M SURE FOR EVERYONE ELSE BUT I'M SPEAKING FOR MYSELF- WE'VE BEEN DOING. I THINK AN INCREDIBLE JOB OF TRYING TO BE MINDFUL OF YOU KNOW PEOPLE SHUT OFF IN TERMS OF. YOU KNOW WHEN I HEARD RIGHT NOW THIS STORY I'M SORRY THAT TESTIMONY OF PATRICIA ROMERO. YOU KNOW IT GIVES ME CONCERN AS WELL THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT CAN'T AFFORD TO GO BUY FOOD AND DOWN SO I'M SURE SHE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE THERE SO MANY CELL OF COURSE THERE'S A BALANCE ON BOTH SIDES WE WANT TO BE RESPECTFUL RESPONSIBLE. TO OUR CONSTITUENTS TO FOLKS LIKE PATRICIA WHOSE EVERYTHING BUT AT THE SAME TIME I FEEL THAT WE ARE ALREADY ON OVER DRIVE TRYING TO FIX THE PROBLEM. AS EVIDENCED BY THE EIGHT HOUR I THINK GOING TO HAVE TESTIMONY THAT WE HAD. BACK IN NOVEMBER- WE HAD A THREE HOUR AND A HALF LAST WEEK. I HAPPEN TO BE CO CHAIR OF THE WORKING GROUP THAT IS WORKING REALLY DILIGENT NEED TO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS THAT JOB. THINK WE'VE DONE RIGHT IN TERMS IN TRYING TO BE INFORMED AND READ INFORMATION AT OUR FINGER TEST SO THAT WE CAN SOLVE THE PROBLEM AND BRING ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TO THE TABLE- BUT I ALSO LIKE I SAID I'M VERY. HOPEFUL BECAUSE YOU'VE DONE SUCH A GREAT JOB OF COMING TO MY OFFICE SITTING DOWN WITH ME AND TALKING ABOUT THE SERIOUS CONCERNS AND- FOR ME AS STRIKING A BALANCE BETWEEN. THE SAFETY OF PEOPLE THEIR LIVES PROPERTY LOSS. BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT WE HOLD BAD ACTORS ACCOUNTABLE SWITCH THAT BALANCE AND WE TRYING TO FIND AN- AND WE'VE ALREADY DISCUSSED THAT BECAUSE OF ALL THE WORK YOU'VE DONE WITH ME I WILL. GIVE YOU THAT COURTESY BUILD BUT I. REALLY WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT I DON'T FEEL HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED HERE TDAY AND- SO I JUST WANT TO BE. VERY VOCAL ABOUT HOW I FEEL ABOUT THIS BILL BACK. AGAIN I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU AND I WILL CONTINUE WORK WITH EVERYONE THAT'S COME TO MY OFFICE TO ENSURE THAT WE STRIKE THAT. MEANS THANK YOU. YOU TURN THANKS OKAY. THANK WAS IT THE AUTHOR WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS. THE OLD. I REALLY DON'T BELIEVE THIS BILL IS NEEDED YOUR FRANKLY WITH- THE CBC OVERSIGHT I THINK IT IS PREMATURE- CENTER HERTZBERG- BROUGHT THAT POINT UP- I BELIEVE IT GIVES PERVERSE INCENTIVES THAT COULD HARM PEOPLE AND AS A RUBIO JUST A TALK ABOUT THAT AS WELL I THINK ULTIMATELY AS CENTER BRADFORD SAID IT ALSO IS GOING GREAT IT COULD VERY WELL INCREASE RATES FOR. EVERYBODY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HOWEVER. I BELIEVE WHAT I SAW ON THE POWERSHOT OFFICE OF OCTOBER NIGHT. WAS A BLATANT DISREGARD BY P. JEANNIE. TO TRANSFER THEIR RISKS. FROM RATE FROM THEMSELVES TO RATEPAYERS IS RESULT OF THAT I AM GOING TO VOTE TO SUPPORT- MOVING THIS BILL ON THE LIKE CENTER HERTZBERG I DO RESERVE THE RIGHT I DO WANT TO SEE SOME OF THESE THINGS CHANGED- IT FIXED YOU'RE GOING FORWARD WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE I THINK IS REALLY- IMPORTANT WELL HERE. AND WE'LL GIVE A COURTESY VOTE TODAY. THANK YOU DID YOU WANT ME TO I'M SORRY THANK YOU MISS TO IT AT MISTER CHAIR I DIDN'T AND I HAVE TO I AGREE WITH SENATOR DODD'S COMMENTS AND JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT I'VE HEARD TODAY IT'S- KNOWING THIS WAS A OF. A BLATANT DISREGARD AND- THAT WE SAW IN IN OCTOBER AND AN ACTION THAT. THAT SHOULD NOT BE TOLERATED WILL NOT BE TOLERATED IN THE FUTURE IN THE GOVERNOR AND THE P. YOU SEE ARE WORKING CLOSELY. TO DEVELOP CERTAIN METRICS AROUND THE FUTURE BLACKOUTS OR POWER SHUT OFF THAT WERE RECEIVED AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE. THIS ISSUE NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED I DON'T THINK LEGISLATING SOLUTIONS TO THAT- IT IS THE BEST WAY. TO HANDLE IT I AM I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL BECAUSE I THINK IT'S NECESSARY TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION BECAUSE THERE MAY BE THAT SWEET SPOT THAT WE REGION AND CAN. DETERMINE AN ACTION THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR THE DIGITAL AGE. FOR TO DICTATE. HOW AND WHEN AND WHEN. IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU FUTURE WE ENTERTAIN A MOTION- WITH AMENDMENTS TO THE FOR THE MANAGED TO BE TAKEN APPROPRIATIONS WE HAVE A MOTION- DID YOU WANNA MAKE SOME CLOSING COMMENTS- YES I JUST- BRIEFLY- FOR SO THANK YOU COLLEAGUES I DO WANT TO STRESS THAT THIS BILL. I'M ASSUMING IF IT COMES OUT OF APPROPRIATIONS- IT WILL BE ON THE FLOOR- WITHIN A COUPLE WEEKS SO I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO. YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE WE WILL WELCOME AS PROMPT FEEDBACK FROM AS POSSIBLE BUT I DON'T YOU KNOW IT'S NOT TWO WEEKS NOT A LOT TIMES. YOUR RESULT EVERY ISSUE WITH YOU THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR JUST TO SET THAT. AN EXPECTATION- TO BE VERY CLEAR THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT BANNING AND THE- THESE BAND BLACKOUTS AS IS THE BEGINNING THEY HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY AND WE'RE NOT TRYING TO ELIMINATE THEM AND THEY CAN SAVE. LIVES AND PROPERTY IS ABOUT ESTABLISHING A RUBIO SAID A BALANCE I AGREE WE NEED A BALANCE AND RIGHT NOW THERE IS NOT A BIG ONES WRITTEN OUT UTILITIES. GINNY BUT I TRUST P. JEANNIE. HOW ARE ARE ARE IN ON THE SIDE A BROADER AND BIGGER AND MORE FREQUENT BLACKOUTS. TWO AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE IMPACTED UP ONE OF THEM. AND SO IT'S A ALL GIVING YOU TILL IT IS AN INCENTIVE. TO USE PLAN BLACKOUTS AS ACE AS A SCALPEL AND NOT AS A SLEDGEHAMMER AND RIGHT NOW WE ARE AT TIME SEEING A SLEDGE HAMMER APPROACH. AND THAT IS VERY VERY HOPEFUL TO INDIVIDUAL- TO LOOK BOOK UNITY IS THE ANSWER. AND TO ESTABLISH THAT BALANCE. HILL AYE MCGUIRE RUBIO. RUBIO AYE SKINNER STERN. STERN AYE WIENER WIENER AYE WILL HAVE A ROLE OF TRAPS AND MEMBERS THE BILL HAS ENOUGH VOTES. UP TAKE AS PURSUANT TO SENATE RULE TWENTY NINE POINT TEN BE ARE WE THE COMMITTEE IS REQUIRED TO HEAR SB THREE EIGHTY SIX BY SENATOR COUPLE YET ALL AND TO TAKE TESTIMONY. ON THIS BILL CIRCLE YOU'RE WELCOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR I UNDERSTAND THAT THE RECOMMENDATION IS GOING TO BE TO HOLD THIS BILL IN COMMITTEE AND SO I'M WHICH WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THAT I'M PRESENTING HERE TODAY- SB THREE EIGHTY SIX IS A DISTRICT BILL WHICH WILL PROVIDE ECONOMIC FLEXIBILITY TO THE MODESTO INTERLOCUTORS XIN DISTRICTS AND THE RATE PAYERS. THAT HAVE BEEN PRODUCING ZERO CARBON ENERGY FOR OVER OVER THE YEARS YOU YOU HEARD THIS BILL- IN AND IT PASSED OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE- AND THAT AMENDMENT THAT WE MADE WAS TO BE IN RESPONSE TO OPPOSITION THE CONCERN THAT THESE VARIEGATION DISTRICTS COULD BACKSLIDE AND USE. THE ENERGY- BE AMENDED THE BILL TO ALLOW. ME TO REQUIRE THEM TO INVEST. THE RESOURCES THAT THEY OTHRWISE WOULD INVEST IN IN SOLAR AND WIND ENERGY IN ENERGY STORAGE- SO THAT- WE COULD. HELP THEM TO MEET THEIR ENERGY GOALS AND ALSO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE RATE PAYERS- BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WHICH WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS GENERATING ENERGY WHICH THEY DON'T NEED ANY SELL OFF AT A LOSS WHICH- IS THERE. HERE'S TO PAY THE SCIENCE IS CLEAR RENEWABLE ENERGY IS GENERATED FROM SOLAR WIND AND WATER WHEN THE R. PS WAS CREATED SOLAR AND WIND NEEDED A SUBSIDY TO COMPETE IN CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY MARKET BECAUSE IT WAS SO EXPENSIVE. TEN PLUS YEARS LATER CALIFORNIA. HAVE BEEN PAYING EIGHT KERR SAYS WE'RE ENERG IN ORDER TO CURB OVER GENERATION AND MAINTAIN A RELIABLE GRADE. LOW INCOME AND POOR COMMUNITIES IN SENATE-DISTRICT TWELVE HAVE BEEN SUBSIDIZING SOLAR ENERGY FOR WEALTHY POPULATED COASTAL COMMUNITIES SINCE THE OUR PS WAS ENACTED SB THREE EIGHTY SIX IS AN EFORT TO MAKE MODEST STEPS TOWARDS THAT INEQUALITY. CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE- TERM IS CLIMATE GOALS LARGE HYDRO AS A RECOGNIZED RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCE WASHINGTON STATE WILL GET 21100% RENEWABLE ENEGY BEFORE CALIFORNIA BY KIND COUNTING HYDRO. CALIFORNIA INSTEAD PLACE POLITICS IS WHAT COUNTS AND WHEN THE GOAL TO REACH SO THAT WALL STREET BACK SOLAR ENERGY FIRMS CAN CONTINUE CONVERTING AGRICULTURAL LAND INTO SOLAR FARMS. OR SO THAT MASSIVE PART OF THE NEVADA DESERT CAN BE CONVERTED TO SOLAR FORMS WITH NEW TRANSMISSION LINES IN INFRASTRUCTURE CARING THAT RENEWABLE ENERGY HUNDREDS OF MILES BACK THROUGH NATURAL LANDS RIGHT BACK TO LOS ANGELES. SB THREE EIGHTY SIX WAS MADE INTO A STATEWIDE LIGHTNING ROD LAST YEAR- AS I SAID THIS COMMITTEE PASSED IT OUT AND IT WAS SET TO BE HEARD ON THE FLOOR. AND FORMER LEADERS OF THIS SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA USE THE SEAL OF THE LEGISLATURE TO PUSH MEMBERS INTO CHANGING THEIR VOTE. AS I SAID AFTER IT PASSED FROM THIS COMMITTEE. SB THREE EIGHTY SIX IS NOT SET NEW PRESIDENT. OTHER PO USE CURRENTLY COUNT THEIR HYDRO ENERGY TO SATISFY RENEWABLE ENERGY PROCUREMENT REQUIREMENTS. THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THOSE PO USE GET TO COUNT OVER 50% OF THEIR HYDRO ENERGY AND DON'T YOU TO PROCURE EXCEPT RENEWABLES. BECAUSE SO MUCH OF THEIR ENERGY COMES FROM GROW. NOW THERE IS A TYPICAL GOVERNMENT CREATED OXYMORON. THE PROBLEM IS IT TURLOCK IN MODESTO DO NOT GET ENOUGH OF THEIR ENERGY FROM DON PEDRO DAM OR THEY WOULD QUALIFY FOR IN OUR P. S. EXEMPTION IN OTHER WORDS SAN FRANCISCO HAS THE EXEMPTION BUT NOT- RURAL CALIFORNIA. SB THREE EIGHTY SIXES ABOUT EQUITY UNDER THE OUR PS AND NOT PLAYING POLITICS WITH SCIENCE IN ORDER TO MANIPULATE POLITICAL IN ENERGY MARKETS. WHEN FEDERAL DOLLY COMMITTEE SUBSIDIZE ENERGY FOR OTHERS. THIS IS A VERY OF A REGRESSIVE TAX ON OUR POOREST COMMUNITIES IN THE FORM OF HIGH ENERGY COSTS. AS WE DID IN THE ANALYSIS HE COSTS ARE NOT IN THIS VALLEY WHERE IT IS HOT IN THE SUMMER AND COLD IN THE WINTER AND TIERED RATE SYSTEM. POOR THE MOST. JEAN SECURITY IS HIGHEST. IN THE CENTRAL IN IMPERIAL VALLEY'S. INNER WEALTHIEST COASTAL AREAS WHERE TEMPERATURES ARE MORE MODERATE. THE CURRENT SYSTEM WILL HAVE THESE POOR COMMUNITY SUBSIDIZING SOLAR AND WIND FOR ANOTHER TWENTY YEARS IGNORING GOOD SCIENCE THE COUNT WATER SOLAR AND WIND ACT EQUITABLY. REGARDING THE COST LIMITATION% COMPLIANCE OPTION DON PEDRO IS AN ASSET THAT IS OWNED BY THE DISTRICTS PURSUING ACOSTA LIMITATION OP OPTION WHICH IS IN THE- IN THE ANALYSIS WOULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE DISTRICTS FINANCING STANDING. THE DISTRICT MIGHT MUST ENSURE CONTINUED CAPITAL AXIS AT REASONABLE COST IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE DAM AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE IN ASSETS THE DISTRICTS CREDIT PROFILE IS ALREADY LIMITED BY THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATES THAT EXCEED STATE AND NATIONAL AVERAGES AND THE DEPRESSD ECONOMIC PROFILE OF THEIR SERVICE TERRITORY. THE COST LIMITATION OPTION WOULD ESSENTIALLY INDICATE TO THE MARKET THAT THE DISTRICTS COULD NOT MEET THEIR FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS. WOULD LEAD TO A DETERIORATION OF THE FINANCIAL PROFILE AND WILL BE DISASTROUS FOR THEM. ACCORDING TO THE METHODOLOGY USED BY MOODY'S CREDIT RATING COMPANY FOR ITS U. S. PUBLIC POWER ELECTRIC UTILITIES WITH GENERATION OWNERSHIP EXPOSURE PUBLIC POWER ELECTRIC UTILITIES THAT OWN GENERATION ASSETS HAVE MORE BUSINESS COMPLEXITY AND FUNDAMENTAL CREDIT RISKS THAN THOSE WHO DO NOT OWN GENERATION ASSETS WHICH IS TRUE WITH OTHER IRRIGATION DISTRICTS. THESE RISKS INCLUDE EXPOSURE TO COMMODITY MARKETS ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS TO MAINTAIN REFURBISH A REPLACE GENERATION ASSETS. MOODY'S METHODOLOGY CONSIDERS A NUMBER OF FACTORS FOR THE RATINGS INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO HAVE PREDICTABLE AND TIME THE RATE SETTING THE STRENGTH OF THE CUSTOMER BASE SERVE THEIR ECONOMY. GENERATION AND POWER PROCUREMENT RISK EXPOSURE AND ABILITY TO MAINTAIN DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS. COST CONTAINMENT IS DETRIMENTAL TO DISTRICTS THAT STILL HAVE TO BEAT THE 1100% ZERO INNER CARBON ENERGY MANDATE BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE IN OTHER WORDS. THAT NEED TO MARKET THAT NEED. GO TO THE MARKET TO MAKE LOOK. AS I SAID IN MY INTRODUCTION THIS IS A DISTRICT BELL IT DEALS WITH EQUITY. GOOD SCIENCE AND ALLOWS FLEXIBILITY TO MEET THE MEET THE GOOD CLIMATE GOALS THAT WE ALL WANT TO MEET. STORAGE IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO INVEST IN IN IF I MIGHT SAY- PART OF WHAT WHAT HAS BECOME CLEAR TO ME IN THIS WHOLE ENERGY SECTOR AS WE LOOK AT MAKING NVESTMENTS IN THE RP A SYSTEM MAKING INVESTMENTS. IN IN STORAGE AND HOW THIS ALL PLAYS OUT WITH THAT CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE HIGHER THE RISK OF FIRES. IS THAT WE HAVE DONE A REALLY POOR JOB OF GUARANTEEING THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE OUR OUR ELECTRICAL GET WORKING AND RUNNING. AND WHAT PEOPLE ARE TURNING TO IS OUR DIRTY GENERATORS WHO ARE WHO ARE PROLIFERATING ALL OVER THE STATE AS A WAY TO HAVE ENERGY SECURITY AND THOSE GENERATORS ARE. BY WITH ENERGY SOURCES THAT ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH A CLEAN AREA ERROR ERROR GOALS AND SO WE'RE CREATING THIS THIS. IN THIS ENVIRONMENT WHERE WHAT PEOPLE ARE DOING IS THEY'RE MOVING TO SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO BE CONTRARY TO OUR TO OUR GOALS IN THE STATE SO- WITH THAT I WOULD SAY I THINK YOU FOR YOUR VOTE THE LAST TIME I UNDERSTAND THIS IS GOING TO BE HELD A COMMITTEE- I MEDICARE. AND RECENT PRESENTING TODAY ARM IS I'M AT OUR RATE PAYER. PAYERS HOW CAN WE INSURE THAT WE HAVE THE ELECTRICAL- AG AGREED WORKING AT AND HOW CAN WE INVEST IN THE KINDS OF THINGS HOW CAN WE TAKE THE LIMITED DOLLARS. THAT ARE TAXPAYERS ARE RATE PAYERS ARE PAYING AND INVEST THEM IN IT IN A SYSTEM THAT'S GOING TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE- AT A RELIABLE SOURCE OF ENERGY IN YEARS TO COME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PERCENT. ENGINER ANY QUESTION I WANT ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE BECOME FOR. MORNING MIKHAIL SCARLET HERE THE- WITH THE GOLF WITH YOU ON BEHALF OF MISTER NATION DISTRICT AND FOR THE REASONS THAT OUR STATE OR IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. I REMEMBER THE OF THE TRUCKER ASIAN DISTRICT HERE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. PATRICK THE CALIFORNIA SPEED TILDES CESSATION ALSO IN SUPPORT. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FOR. WHAT TO A TABLE AND ON. THE REST WILL I SHOULD FORM A LINE AT THE MIKE FOR. THANK YOU MATT FRIEDMAN WITH THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK- WE ARE HERE TO OPPOSE SB THREE EIGHTY SIX WE UNDERSTAND THE AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES FACED BY CUSTOMERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND AS THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS WE'VE BEEN A LEADER IN FIGHTING FOR LOWER RATES AND FOR PROTECTING LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS BUT WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THREE EIGHTY SIX HELPS LEASE LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS AND IT WOULD BE IN OUR VIEW HIGHLY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO CHEAT IN A VARIETY OF STATE GOALS. WE WOULD BE INTERESTED IN WORKING. WITH THE COMMITTEE. FOR TURNING METHODS FOR INSURING AFFORDABILITY THAT DID NOT INVOLVE THE ROLLBACK OF THE STATE'S CLEAN ENERGY AND CLIMATE POLICIES. IN ARGUE THERE IS NO SPECIFIC JUSTIFICATION FOR PROVIDING ON THE EXAM AND IN THIS BILL KLAY TO ERIC DISTRICTS. WHO RECEIVE AVERAGE OF ABOUT AN HOUR SENATE RETAILS. FROM DON DROVE LIKE TO OBJECT THERE MAY THERE YOU TO IN THIS THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT LARGE HYDRO SOURCES. IN THEIR PORTFOLIOS. IN ARGUE THERE IS NO JUST. I THINK YOU NEED TO THE BRIGADE STRIKES THAT WILL BUY TO ALL THE OTHER UTILITIES. IF THAT SAME TREATMENT WERE PROVIDED ALL THE OTHER UTILITIES IT WOULD HAVE DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES. FOR THE STATE'S PROGRAMS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE CALIFORNIA DOES NOT UNIQUELY EXCLUDE LARGE HYDRO POWER FROM THE ACHIEVEMENT OF ITS RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD GOALS- MOST STATES EXCLUDE LARGE HYDRO FROM THERE ARE PS PROGRAMS CALIFORNIA THOUGH LIKE MOST OTHER STATES THAT HAVE ADOPTED THE ZERO CARBON TARGETS INCLUDES LARGE HYDRO ELECTRIC. AS THE TO BRIDGE THE TREATMENT OF THE HUNT PERCENT EUROCHART A LOT SECTOR. TOWARDS EACH MINUTE INTEGRATED RESOURCE AND GOALS ALSO COUNTED AS A CARBON RESOURCE FOR PURPOSES OF THE POWER CONTENT LET. INTERVIEWED UNNECESSARY BECAUSE AS NOTED IN THE IN OUR ANY PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITY CAN ADOPT COST CONTAINMENT MECHANISM TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHAT TYPES OF COSTS THEY ARE WILLING T INCUR TO MEET THE STATE'S RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARDS. THESE MECHANISMS HAVE BEEN ADOPTED BY A NUMBER OF PUBLIC. OR THEIR ABILITY TO FINANCE NEW RESOURCES WE'VE SEEN NO EVIDENCE THAT THE ADOPTION OF THESE LIMITS WHICH ARE PERMITTED UNDER STATE LAW HAVE ANY NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THE ABILITY OF THESE UTILITIES TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN IN FINANCING- IN ADDITION. TO THE BILL WOULD ESTABLISH NEW PRINCE IS IRRIGATION DISTRICTS BUYS. GEORGE WHICH THESE UTILITIES HAVE FOUND IN THEIR INTERPRETED RESOURCES PLANS ARE NOT COST EFFECTIVE THEREFORE IT APPEARS THIS BILL WOULD IMPOSE NEW CAR NEW COSTS ON THE IRRIGATION DISTRICTS. ARE RELATIVE TO WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED UNDER STATE LAW. IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT. BOTH OF THESE IRRIGATION DISTRICTS HAVE IDENTIFIED THE PROCUREMENT OF OUR PS ELIGIBLE RESOURCES UNDER CURRENT LAW AS NECESSARY TO MEET THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION TARGETS ESTABLISHED BY THE STATE AS PART OF THEIR INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANS. IT IS NOT CLEAR HOW THESE UTILITIES METER GHG REDUCTION TARGETSUNDER STATE LAW WITHOUT THESE ARE PS ELIGIBLE RESOURCES. TO FINALLY IN OUR VIEW THIS BILL IS NOT REALLY A DISTRICT BILL AT SCORE ALTHOUGH WE RECOGNIZE THAT IT DOES AFFECT THE PARTICULAR UTILITIES WE THINK IT TO WIPE RANGING PACKS OF THE STATE. PROGRAM AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IS SIMPLY NOT NEXT TO ADDRESS CONCERNS IS TO IRRIGATION DISTRICTS AND WE THINK THE COMMITTEE SHOULD. ALTER APPROACH IN THE FUTURE. IT WOULDN'T CATHERINE PHILLIPS WITH SIERRA CUB CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING OUR- MILLION MEMBERS AND SUPPORTERS AROUND THE STATE INCLUDING IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY- THEY ARE PS IS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE TOOLS FOR REDUCING LOCAL HEALTH THREATENING. AIR POLLUTION AND CLIMATE POLLUTION. AND AS SAID EARLIER- THE OUR PS IS A WORKING. THIS BILL WOULD UNDERCUT THAT SUCCESS. THIS IS MORE THAN A DISTRICT BILL. TAKING AN ACTION LIKE THIS BILL PROPOSES AND WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES WOULD BEFORE EXPANDING OF BROADLY A HYDRO INTO THE OUR PS. OF WOULD SEND A SIGNAL THAT CALIFORNIA'S BACKING AWAY FROM COMMITMENT TO RENEWABLE ENERGY. AND IT'S COMMIT TO CUTTING CLIMATE POLLUTION. SO ON BEHALF OF OUR MEMBERS I URGE YOU TO REJECT THIS BILL AND- YOU KNOW IT WAS A BAD BILL LAST YEAR IT'S A BAD BILL THIS YEAR I HOPE IT DOESN'T COME UP NEXT. THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS.

TINA GAILLARD FOR THREE FIFTY SACRAMENTO THREE FIFTY SOUTH BAY LA AND FOSSEL FREE CALIFORNIA IN OPPOSITION. BERMAN CALIFORNIA DAN JACOBSON OPPOSITION THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMISSIONER DOT I YEAH I WAS ONE THAT- VOTED ON THIS LAST TIME SENATOR AND I'VE- YOU HAVE GOT A LOT OF- BALLS AND- LEARNED A LOT ABOUT THIS ISSUE THAT I DID NOT KNOW- BEFORE WHAT I VOTED ON IT. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK TWO QUESTIONS- THAT THE PERMIT. ONE OF THE POLICIES THAT WE HAVE IS- THE LAST 40% YOU CAN USE HYDRO AS PART OF YOUR- ACCOUNT SO I GUESS WHAT I'M WONDERING IS YOU KNOW WHY IS IT WHY ISN'T THAT GOOD ENOUGH WHAT'S THE ECONOMIC. IMPACT OF WITHIN THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE ALREADY THE POLICIES WE HAVE A PLACE TODAY AND- YOUR ACHIEVING THAT 60% AND THEN USE IT THE YOU UTILIZE THE LAST 40% AS- PART OF A- THAT THE IT WHO HAS TO DO WITH WHEN YOU GET TO COUNT HYDRO- FOR THE USERS THAT ARE. I WOULD SAY. AND THIS IS PART OF THE INEQUITY IN THE SYSTEM IS THAT IF YOUR IF YOUR USE OF HYDRO IS SMALL ENOUGH THEN YOU GET TO COUNT IT NOW- AND- AND AS I SAID IS THIS PERVERSE THIS PERVERSE SYSTEM IS. THE DON PEDRO JENNA DAM HAS BEEN THERE FOR ALMOST A HUNDRED YEARS IT'S NINETY THREE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT- AND- AND IT'S BEEN GREEN FOR BEGINNING JUST AND- THAT THE- POINT AT WHICH YOU'VE GOT TO CAPITA IT. NOW DOESN'T TO YOUR BET. ARE YOU AFTER MARK YEAH I DID HIT TARGET TWENTY TWENTY HAVE TO HIT TARGETS FOR TWENTY THIRTY AND THEN AT THE END YOU CAN USE THAT FOR TWENTY FORTY FIVE. AND SO THAT THEY THEIR THESE PARTICULAR IRRIGATION DISTRICTS HAVE HAD MAJOR INVESTMENTS. IN SOLAR AND WIND ENERGY DESPITE THE FACT THAT. DAM GENERATED OF ENERGY- ALMOST BY ITSELF DEPENDING ON THE YEAR FOR THE RATE PAYERS AND SO THEY END UP WITH EXCESS ENERGY AND HAVE TO SELL IT SOMETIMES IN CALIFORNIA. AND SOMETIMES OUT OF STATE AND BECAUSE THEY'VE HAD TO PAY A PREMIUM FOR THAT DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR SOLAR IN THEIR WIND ENERGY. FACILITIES THEY HAVE TO SELL IT AT A LOSS AGAIN THE RATE PAYERS PAY THE COST OF THAT AND SO THAT THAT. IT DID ACT THAT'S THE ANSWER TO IT IS A GET TO USE IT AT THE VERY END BUT YOU CAN'T USE IT NOW THEY HAVE TO CONTINUE MAKING AND COMMENCE. BUT THE YOU MADE IN YOUR OPENING TESTIMONY WAS ABOUT THE- FINANCIAL VIABILITY FOR YOUR RATE THE RATE PAYERS OF PAY MORE. IT'S ALSO MY UNDERSTANDING OF THERE'S A HARDSHIP EXEMPTION UNDER THE. THE CODE AT THIS POINT TIME THAT. THE GOOD THERE COULD BE SOMETHING THIS FILE LIKE I GUESS WHERE I'M GOING HERE IS YEAH I WAS WILLING TO VOTE FOR THAT FRANKLY I THINK- YOU'VE BEEN BILL IF I BRING THIS UP I OBJECT TO THAT I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW IT'S COURAGE SOMETIME TO BRING UP POLICY THE IS. THAT MIGHT NOT MAKE SENSE TO AN INDIVIDUAL MATE- OR THEIR CONSTITUENTS. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND WE'VE SEEN THE OPPOSITION HERE TODAY. I UNDERSTAND THAT AND THE OVERALL. INTERESTS THAT WE HAVE YOUR ABOUT PRECEDENCE. THAT ARE VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN OUR GREEN ENERGY PROCUREMENTS. FLIGHT CONGRATULATE YOU FOR- IF THANK YOU FOR BRINGING UP A TOUGH ONE BUT I THINK THAT. MORE FROM MY STANDPOINT- BECAUSE OF THOSE PRESS THIS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE MORE CONVERSATION I'M- WILLING HAVE THAT WITH YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT. I DO NOT HAVE ARTICULATED. IT CLEARLY BUT I'M ASKING. THE VOTE BE HELD ON THE BILL IN OTHER WORDS I'M NOT ASKING THAT IT GO OUT AND SO- I THINK. AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND I'D LIKE A IN IT LIKE TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION I GUESS A BIG PART OF THE PASSION I HAVE FOR THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE IS THAT. ONE SIZE DOESN'T FIT ALL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THERE ARE INDEED TENDING CONSEQUENCES- AND I FEEL PART OF OUR OBLIGATION IS TO. SAY LOOK HERE'S THE SCIENCE. ARE YOU THAT THE AIR IS GONNA GET DIRTY OR BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA COUNT HYDRO NOT NOW THAT'S DISINGENUOUS TO ME. IF YOU'RE SAYING WE MAY REVERT TO DIRTY YOUR SOURCES OF ENERGY I GET IT AND THAT'S THE REASON THAT WE LOOKED AT. UP PUTTING A LIMITATION F THE WHICH YOU CAN'T BACKSLIDE NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO. LET'S LOOK AT STORAGE BECAUSE THERE'S DEFINITELY A NEED FOR STORAGE AND- AND THAT'S- WHAT THE COST MORE YES BUT IT SOLVES ANOTHER PROBLEM THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE WHICH IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO ULTIMATELY. NEED STORAGE WHEN THE WIND DOESN'T BLOW IN THE SUN DOESN'T SHINE. AND IF IT'S A DROUGHT THEN WE'RE GONNA NEED STORAGE AND SO THAT'S THE REASON WE MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION BUT BUT AT THIS POINT TO IT. I GUESS I JUST FELT LIKE ON BEHALF OF MY CONSTITUENTS IT HAD TO BE HEARD. AND I AM ASKING THE COMMITTEE VOTE TO HOLD THE BILL THANK YOU. NEED BRINGING THIS MEASURE FOR TAKES GREAT COURAGE BUT AS YOU SHOULD CLEARLY STATED THIS IS ABOUT BEING HONEST AND GENUINE AND TRANSPARENT TO NOT ONLY YOUR DISTRICT BUT TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I WAS A CHEER OF UTILITY COMMITTEE AND ASSEMBLY WHEN OUR PS BILLS ARE MOVING FOR IT WAS A MAJOR FIGHT TO MAKE SURE HYDRO WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THAT BECAUSE IT ALLOWED US TO BUILD A LOT OF AND SOLAR THAT TRULY WAS NEEDED BUT AT THE SAME TIME. WE'RE SHEDDING MORE POWER HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS MORE TO NEVADA THERE WERE USING DURING THE COURSE OF THE DAY AND IF WE'RE GOING TO BE HONEST I'M GOING TO CAN YOU TALK ABOUT A DRUG- FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS THAT'S THE REASON A DARKER VIEW IS GROWING BECAUSE WE'RE BUILDING. MORE OPEN AND SOLAR THAT NOT DISPATCH BILL. I WON THE MOST RELIABLE ENERGY SOURCES WE HAVE. WE SAW PROOF OF IT FROM BC IN. BRITISH COLUMBIA- WASHINGTON DC WENT TO CANADA IT WORKS IN ALL THOSE COUNTRIES. THEY'RE NOT HAVING GROWING POLLUTION BECAUSE OF USING HIGH HYDRO WHICH WAS ONE OF THE CLEANEST SOURCES AROUND. BUT WE BECOME HYPOCRITES AS LEGISLATORS WHEN WE CONTINUE TO PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS THIS HOUSE VALUE WE SHOULD BE. ADDED TO OUR PORTFOLIO WHICH SHOULD BE COUNTY TOWARD- OUR OUR PS A REQUIREMENT JUST LIKE ROOFTOP SOLAR SHOULD BE COUNTED BUT IF WE COUNTED THAT. WOULD WELL BE CAST 60% WOULD BE WELL ON OUR WAY TO. RENO WHEN PROJECT BUT WE DON'T DO THAT BECAUSE WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO BUILD MORE MORE. RESOURCES THAT ARE NOT NEEDED SO I RESPECT THE FACT THAT YOU'RE NOT CALL BEFORE VOTE BUT IF YOU ARE. I WOULD BE I VOTE FOR THE DAY SO. MEASURE WHICH ONE. EXPECT YOUR BOAT TO HOLD IT IN BILLING. WE WILL BUILD A COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. FOR YOUR HELP. CAPTION YES WITH NO OBJECTIONS WERE HOLDEN COMMITTEE. JERRY YOU HAVE SB SEVEN OH TWO WHEN YOU'RE READY YOU MAY BEGIN I DO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES LET ME BEGIN BY THANKING THIS COMMITTEE FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS MEASURE AND EX AND I ACCEPT THE A PROPOSED TO MEN. OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS. TO TAKE IN THE MA'AM IT'S AN APPROPRIATE. MEASURE BUT TO MAKE A MINOR CHANGE TO THE RBS STATUES LONG TERM CONTRACTING PROVISION THE GOES INTO EFFECT NEXT JANUARY UNDER EXISTING LAW CUSTOMERS THAT CHOOSE TO DIRECTLY PRECURSOR RENEWABLE SORT RESOURCES SUCH AS STANFORD UNIVERSITY MAY DO SO AND HAVE THEIR OUR PS CREDITS COUNT FOR THEIR RETAIL SALES SELLER HOWEVER GETTING JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT ELIGIBILITY IS REVOKED. BECAUSE STATE INFERRED NOT THEIR TAIL SELLERS HOLDING OFF TO THE LONG TERM CONTRACT THIS WAS NOT THE INTENT OF THE OUR PS AS A COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THE LONG TERM CONTRACTING PROVISION IN THE RP AS WAS INTENDED ENSURE MARKET CERTAINTY RENEWAL ELEMENT STANFORD IS TAKING AN AGGRESSIVE APPROACH TO READ SHE IN. THE HOUSE GAS EMISSIONS SPEECH HELLO TO ENSURE. LONG RENEW. CAN YOU DO IT WITH THIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU JOSEPH STAGGER STANFORD UNIVERSITY WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S WORK ON THIS AND- SUPPORT THE BILL WE HAVE A MOVE TO ELECT FIRE CAMPUS WHERE 80% THROUGH THE PHYSICAL TRANSFORMATION WERE BUILDINGS AND TRANSPORTATION BUILT TRICITY ELECTRICITY WAS A COMPANION WE NEED CLEAN ELECT CITY DE CARBONIZED WE'VE MOVED WITH ONE LARGE OR PLAN TWENTY SIXTEEN SIGNED A CONTRACT FOR ANOTHER TO BE BUILT IN TWO YEARS MORE THAT WE ARE. TO BE A HOAX CARBON BE WE NEED THIS LIKE PATIENT PASS THAT THESE WILL COUNTY TO OUR PS OTHERWISE OUR ENERGY SERVICE PROVIDER WOULD HAVE TO PROCURE REDUNDANT RENEWABLES FOR US AND EXCEED. CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. THANK YOU MATT FRIEDMAN ON BEHALF OF THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. ON AS AS POINTED OUT BY SENATOR HILL EXISTING LAW REQUIRES AT LEAST ENTITIES. ARE PS PROCUREMENT TO BE SOURCED UNDER LONG TERM CONTRACTS STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED THIS REQUIREMENT IN SB THREE FIFTY AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS IS TO PROMOTE MARKET STABILITY. AND PLACE A PRIMARY EMPHASIS ON CONTRACTING ACTIVITIES THAT WILL DRIVETHE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW RENEWABLE RESOURCES. BUT LONG TERM CONTRACTS MUST BE EXECUTED BY THE LOAD SERVING ENTITY IN ORDER TO COUNT THIS IS A CRITICAL FEATURE OF THE PROGRAM. WE'VE NOTED IN OUR- VIEW OF THE OUR PS PROGRAM THAT IN PARTICULAR DIRECT ACCESS PROVIDERS ARE FACING CHALLENGES IN MEETING BOTH THERE ARE P. ASK AND THEIR LONG TERM CONTRACTING REQUIREMENTS. A RECENT YOU SEE REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE NOTES THE DIRECT ACCESS SUPPLIERS ARE CURRENTLY SHORT OF MEETING THEIR 33% COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS FOR TWENTY TWENTY. THE PC HAS ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT THE ABILITY OF DIRECT ACCESS PROVIDERS. MEET THE LONG TERM CONTRACTING REQUIREMENTS- IN RECENT REPORTS IN DECISIONS THAT THEY'VE ISSUED. NOW WE KNOW THAT SOME DIRECT ACCESS CUSTOMERS DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO ENTER IN THE LONG TERM. IT'S THEMSELVES FOR IN OUR PS RESOURCE. YOUR OF AN- INSTANT DISABLED. AND COST. MAKING DIRECT LONG TERM WHOLESALE COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE THE OUTPUT OF RENEWABLE ENERGY DIRECTLY FROM NEWLY CONSTRUCTED LARGE SCALE FACILITIES. AND IN MANY CASES THESE CUSTOMER COMMITMENTS HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL TO FINANCING AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROJECTS THESE ARE PRIMARILY INSTITUTIONAL CUSTOMERS APPLE GOOGLE FACEBOOK STANFORD. THE UC SYSTEM I'M AND THERE'S SOME CAPACITY FOR ADDITIONAL LARGE CUSTOMERS TO MAKE THESE NEW LONG TERM COMMITMENTS BUT UNDER CURRENT LAW THEY CAN'T BE COUNTED TOWARDS THE OUR PS REQUIREMENTS. OF THE LOAD SERVING AND EIGHTY SERVING THAT CUSTOMER BECAUSE THAT LOW SERVING AND HE'S NOT THE COUNTERPARTY. IN OUR VIEW ALLOWING CUSTOMER CONTRACT TO COUNT TOWARDS THE LONG TERM CONTRACTING REQUIREMENTS MAKES SENSE AS LONG AS THEY'RE APPROPRIATE RESTRICTIONS TO PREVENT ABUSE. SB SEVEN OH TWO INCLUDES THE APPROPRIATE PROVISIONS WE THINK IT MAKES SENSE WE UNDERSTAND THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WOULD RESTRICT THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL WILL. LIKELY TO THE DEAL THAT WERE EXECUTED BY STANFORD WE THINK THAT THE LEGEND SHOULD. WOULDN'T IT ALL. RACKS THE PROPOSED CHANGES WITH A LOT BRING COURAGE THESE CUSTOMERS TO ENTER INTO LONG TERM CONTRACTS FOR NEW RESOURCES WITHOUT CREATING LOOPHOLES THAT UNDERMINE THE ABILITY OF THE STATE TO ACHIEVE ITS GOALS AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT THE PRINCIPLE AT STAKE HERE WHAT ESTABLISH THE CORRECT INCENTIVES TO SPUR THE DEVELOPMENT OF INCREMENTAL RESOURCES IN THE COMING YEARS THANK YOU THANK YOU. THE QUICKNESS THANK YOU MELISSA CORTEZ ROTH ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA WIND ENERGY ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT LIKE TO ASSOCIATE ARE CAUGHT WITHOUT OF TURN WE'D LIKE TO SEE CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS ALL WHILE SHE THE NARROWING SPELL IT LIKE IT CAN DISCUSSIONS BEYOND JUST A STAND FOR CONTRACT THANK YOU A TO ADDRESS. HERE I GUESS FOR THE UNION A SCIENTIST IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. LEAVE ERAS ON BEHALF OF THE INDEPENDENT ENERGY PRODUCERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THE COMMITTEE CASSANDER GOFF WITH CALPINE CAL PAINS IN A UNIQUE POSITION BOTH AS AN INDEPENDENT ENERGY PROVIDER WE HAVE OUR GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES I ALWAYS TALK TO YOU ABOUT- BUT WE'RE ALSO AND ENERGY SERVICE PROVIDER OR FORTUNATE TO HAVE STANFORD THE OUR CUSTOMER- AND WE DO BACK OFFICE WORK FOR CCA SO WORK FOR UNIQUE IN THAT AREA. WE SUPPORT THE BILL AS REGIONALLY INTRODUCED NOT ONLY FOR OUR CUSTOMERS- BUT ALSO WEARING A RENEWABLE ENERGY HAT. IT'S NO THAT NO NEWS TO ANY OF YOU THAT THE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO LARGE SCALE R. F. THOSE FOR RENEWABLE RESOURCES AND SO WE THINK INCREASING THE NUMBER OF BUYERS IS BETTER AND ALIGN OURSELVES WITH MR FRIEDMAN'S- COMMENTS SO WE WOULD HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION SO THAT IT NOT ONLY BENEFITS- STANFORD BUT OTHER CUSTOMERS AND ALSO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT TO POINT OUT THAT IS I EXTEND THE BILL AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED IF STATE TWENTY. S. OR CITED TO GO BACK TO THE INCUMBENT UTILITY THE CCA BACK TRY GO WITH THEM SO ALL LOAD SERVING ENTITIES WHO HAVE TO MEET THE 65% STANDARD. GET THE BENEFIT OF THE CONTRACT THAT THAT STANFORD OR ANY OTHER AND USE CUSTOMER BRINGS WITH THEM AND WE'VE ALL READ THE HEADLINES THE GOOGLE'S THE WALMARTS THE JOHNSON AND JOHNSON THEY'RE ALL ENTERING INTO THESE CONTRACTS. AND WE WANT TO KEEP THOSE INCENTIVES GOING BECAUSE MORE BUYERS ARE GOOD SO THANK YOU WHEN WE LOOK FOR TO KICKING IN CONVERSATION RICHARD. THE QUICKNESS THEIR CHAIR MEMBERS MIKE MONEY GOING TO BE HAVE THE COALITION OF CALIFORNIA UTILITY EMPLOYEES AND VERY STRONG SUPPORT CENTERS BACK. THANK YOU.
