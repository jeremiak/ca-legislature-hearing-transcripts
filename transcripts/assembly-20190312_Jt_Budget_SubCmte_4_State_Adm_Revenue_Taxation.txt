ADMINISTRATION. THEY WERE JOINED BY THE REVENUE AND TAXATION COMMITTEE DISCUSSED THE GOVERNOR'S EITC EXPANSION AND TAX CONFORMING PROPOSAL. TODAY'S HEARING IS INFORMATIONAL OR REPEAT INFORMATIONAL ONLY ALONG AS THE CHANCE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS AND PROVIDE SOME INITIAL THOUGHTS. THE ASSEMBLY HAS BEEN A STRONG PROPONENT OF CREATING A SPENDING THE I. T. THE CAL EITC. IT'S EXCITING TO SEE THE PROPOSAL TO EXPAND THE PROGRAM. I KNOW STAKEHOLDERS IN THE AUDIO LET US IN DIFFERENT IDEAS OF HOW TO EXPAND THE PROGRAM BUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IT'S A GREAT STARTING PLACE FOR THIS CONVERSATION. MORE CHALLENGING THE CONFORMING PROVISIONS THAT FUND THE ITC EXPANSION. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDE A LARGE TAX CUTS TO UPPER INCOME FAMILIES IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN TAX REFORM BILL IT ALSO INCLUDES A PROVISION. THAT REDUCING TAX CREDITS FOR THE SAME TAXPAYERS TO PARTIALLY OFFSET THE COST OF THE OVERALL PACKAGE. WE'RE CONSIDERING CONFORMING TO SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS. IN MANY CASES THE TAXPAYERS ARE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS HAVE RECEIVED AT LARGE REDUCTION IN OTHER PARTS OF THEIR FEDERAL TAX LIABILITIES. THEY'VE COME OUT WAY AHEAD. SO CONFORMANCE PROVISIONS THE STATE LEVEL MAY NOT ADVERSELY IMPACT THEIR OVERALL SAID TEXAS RATIONS. IN BY CONFORMING WE SIMPLIFY THE TAX PLANNING FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS. BUT SOME CAL FOR TAXPAYERS ARE DISCOVERING NOT ALL TAXPAYERS IF YOU THE BENEFIT THIS MASSIVE FEDERAL TAX CUTS. WE DON'T WANT TO INCREASE TAXES ON THOSE INDIVIDUALS A SECOND TIME. IF WE CAN SIMPLY MISTRESSES CONFIRM RIPPLES ALL WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE DETAILS OF EVERY LINE SO WE KNOW WHO'S IMPACTED IN HOUSE. THAT WAY WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE MAKING INFORMACIÃ³N. BEFORE WE DO THAT I WANT TO GO AHEAD AND CAN WE STILL AS A QUORUM PLEASE. UBER HERE CHIU. LACKEY. THIS AREA WICKS. I ONE OF WELCOME IS BURKE CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON pIN THE OPENING COMMENTS THIS BURKE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOPER -- GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY AS MANY OF YOU KNOW I'M FEDERAL TAX CONFORMITY CAN GET VERY COMPLICATED VERY QUICKLY. AND SO I'M HOPING THAT THIS HEARING WILL GIVE US A BETTER UNDERSTANDING ALONG WITH MORE DETAILS OF SOME OF THE FEDERAL PROVISIONS NOTED -- IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. TYPICALLY I THINK WE'RE ALL INTERESTED IN GETTING MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE PROPOSED OPPORTUNITY ZONES PROVISION AS WELL AS WHY CERTAIN FEDERAL PROVISIONS WERE CHOSEN LINE OTHER THINGS WERE LEFT OUT. AND ALTHOUGH I AM AN ADVOCATE OF THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT I WOULD LIKE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHY THE GOVERNOR HAS CHOSEN TO PAIR OF FEDERAL TAX FOR CONFORMITY WITH THE EXPANSION OF THE ATC -- I WOULD ALSO I'M WE'RE ALSO HOPING TO GET THE FINISHED PRODUCT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SO OBVIOUSLY -- WE ONLY HAVE ABOUT SEVENTY DAYS FOR US TO THAT WE NEED IT BEFORE SO THAT WE CAN PROPERLY REVIEW IT AS AN ASSEMBLY AND I THINK THAT THIS BODY WITH THE CONFLICT. WITH IS COMPLICATED AN ISSUE AS IT IS DOES NEED TIME TO REVIEW THAT. I LOOK FOR TO THE HEARING FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO ME IMPACT BE IMPACTED BY THIS PROPOSAL AS WE MOVE FOR WITH THE HEARING I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER FOR HAVING US AND THANKS TO THE MEMBERS THAT ARE HERE TODAY THIS IS AT IT CONFORMITY IS A VERY COMPLICATED ISSUE AND IT IS GOING TO TAKE TIME. THIS IS SOME AS AN ASSEMBLY HAVE NOT ACTUALLY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEAL WITH THIS BEFORE SO. THANK YOU. ANY COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. IT WAS PART OF FIRST AUTUMN ISSUE ONE GOVERNOR'S WORKING FAMILIES TAX CREDIT AND TESTING FOR ME PROPOSAL. GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS JJ ABRAMS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND I WANNA THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY -- TO PRESENT THE GOVERNOR'S CONFORMITY EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT EXPANSION OF PACKAGE. AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL. OF THAT PACKAGE INCLUDES AN EXPANSION OF THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. AND AND THE TAX CONFORMITY PACKAGE WILL RAISE ENOUGH REVENUE BILLION DOLLARS TO PAY FOR THE CURRENT AND EXISTING EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. WE'RE COMBINING THESE TWO PROVISIONS BECAUSE WITHOUT THE CONFORMITY PACKAGE THERE'S NO WAY TO PAY FOR THE EXPANSION OF THE OF THE EITC. THIS COMBINED CONFORMITY EITC PACKAGE IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE BALANCED AND RESILIENT BUDGET THAT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED. IN IN JANUARY. I WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE A SUMMARY OF THE PROVISIONS INCLUDED IN THE EIGHTY SI EXPANSION. AS WELL AS A BRIEF DISCUSSION OF THE CONFORMITY PACKAGE AND EACH HAS PROVISIONS AND I'M ASSUMING THAT SUCH QUICK. QUESTIONS AND DISCUSSION WE CAN GET INTO SOME MORE THE DETAILS. I WANT TO START WITH THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. THE CAL THE ATC THE COST OF LIVING REFUND. WOULD EXTEND IT WOULD EXPAND THE CURRENT EITC IN THREE WAYS. FIRST IT SETS THE MAXIMUM INCOME. TO QUALIFY FOR THE CREDIT AT THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH IS THE FULL TIME OF WHICH IS A FULL TIME AND WAIT FOR SOMEONE EARNING FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR. AND IF HE DOES THAT FOR ALL TAXPAYERS INCLUDING THOSE WHO HAVE NO DEPENDENTS. UNDER CURRENT LAW THE MAXIMUM INCOME FOR THE EIGHTY SI. HIS LESSON SEVENTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THOSE WITH NO DEPENDENTS AND THIS LESSON TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR TAXPAYERS WITH DEPENDENTS. OUR PROPOSAL WOULD ALSO LEAVE THE MAXIMUM INCOME AT THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY TWO OR WIN THE THE STATE WIDE. OF MINIMUM WAGE KICKS IN AT AT FIFTEEN DOLLARS PER HOUR -- THE MAXIMUM INCOME AFTER TWENTY TWENTY TWO WOULD BE INDEXED TO INFLATION. OUR PROPOSAL ALSO CREATES AN ADDITIONAL CREDIT. FOR FAMILIES WITH A CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF SIX A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER FAMILY. THIS ADDITIONAL CREDIT IS PHASED OUT EVENLY BETWEEN TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS SO IT IN THE SAME PLACE WHERE THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT WOULDN'T. AND FINALLY THE STRUCTURE OF THE CREDIT IS CHANGED SO THAT HOUSEHOLDS. IN THE UPPER HALF OF THE EARNED INCOME TAX INCOME RANGE. BOTH THOSE WITH AND WITHOUT A QUALIFYING DEPENDENTS WILL RECEIVE A LARGER BENEFIT. AS HE E. I. T. C. INCOME RATE HAS BEEN EXPANDED IN THE PAST TWO YEARS THOSE IN THE EXPANDED INCOME RANGE. RECEIVE RELATIVELY MINOR -- A CREDIT AMOUNTS AVERAGING AROUND A HUNDRED A HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS -- FOR FOR HOUSEHOLD WITH DEPENDENT. FOR HOUSEHOLDS WITH NO DEPENDENTS. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE THOSE HOUSEHOLDS WITH MORE GENEROUS CREDIT ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE -- IN SOME CASES. THE CAL EITC THE COST OF LIVING REFUND IS EXPECTED TO COST ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS ROUGHLY SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE PROPOSED EXPANSION. AND FOR HIM MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE EXISTING PROGRAM. TO PAY FOR THE ENTIRE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING A CONFORMITY PACKAGE. THE DOT SEVERAL CHANGES THAT WILL MAKE TAX COMPLIANCE AND ADMINISTRATION EASIER FOR TAXPAYERS. TAX REPAIRS OF THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. AS WELL AS A DOCTOR OTHER CHANGES THAT MAKE GOOD POLICY SENSE. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ADOPTED SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE TAX CODE THE CHANGE TO INDIVIDUALS AND CORPORATIONS CALCULATE THEIR TAX LIABILITY. OUR PROPOSAL IS AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT THE CALIFORNIA PERSONAL INCOME TAX. AND CORPORATE TAX SYSTEMS ARE INEVITABLY LINKED. TO THE FEDERAL TAX SYSTEMS AND IN SOME CASES CONFORMITY TO CERTAIN TAX PROVISIONS IS NECESSARY FOR AN EFFICIENT AND ADMINISTRATION OF OUR TAX SYSTEM. IN ADDITION THERE ARE SEVERAL CHANGES ADOPTED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO MAKE GOOD POLICY CENTS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ANOTHER POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS THAT THIS IS NOT A TAX REFORM PROPOSAL WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT ITEMS THAT WILL EASY ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN ON TAXPAYERS. OR FOR PROVISIONS THAT MAKES SENSE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS OR IN COMBINATION WITH ONE OR TWO OTHER PROVISIONS. WE'RE NOT LOOKING WITH THIS PACKAGE TO BRING ABOUT FUNDAMENTAL TAX REFORM. SO I'D LIKE TO GO THROUGH AND DESCRIBE THE VARIOUS ITEMS IN OUR TAX CONFORMITY PACKAGE VERY SADDAM'S ARE LISTED ON PAGE FOR THE HEARING AGENDA -- AND AND THIS AND THIS IS THE ADMINISTRATION CONFORMING PROPOSAL. THE FIRST ITEM. IS A SMALL BUSINESS ACCOUNTING REFORM CATION RULES UNDER CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW. WE ALLOW CERTAIN SMALL BUSINESSES MORE FLEXIBILITY IN THE CAL IN THE COUNTY RULES THAT THE USE. GENERALLY SMALL BUSINESSES ARE ALLOWED TO USE RULES. I DO NOT KEEP TRACK OF THE TIMING OF INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS AS PRECISELY AS LARGE LARGER BUSINESSES MUST FEEL. OKAY OUR RULES WERE THE SAME AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT UNTIL THE ADOPTED THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN NOT LAW MADE MORE BUSINESSES ELIGIBLE FOR THE SIMPLIFIED RULES -- ESSENTIALLY. ALL TAXPAYERS WITH HER TO SEE TEN OR TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. NOW CONFORMING TO THOSE RULES MANY SMALL BUSINESSES WILL BE REQUIRED -- TO TO KEEP TWO SUCH BOOKS ONE SET FOR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ONE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE SECOND ITEM ON OUR LIST IS REPEAL OF TECHNICAL TERMINATION OF PARTNERSHIPS. UNDER PRIOR LAW AND UNDER PRIOR FEDERAL LONG CURRENT STATE LAW. IF A PARTNERSHIP AS A TRANSFER OF MORE THAN 50%. OF THE TOTAL INTEREST IN PARTNERSHIP CAPITAL PROFITS WITHIN A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD. THE PARTNERSHIP IS CONSIDERED TO BE TECHNICALLY TERMINATED EVEN IF THE PARTNERSHIP THE THE ACTIVITY OF THE BUSINESS CONTINUES. WHAT THIS MEANS IT CAUSES A SEVERAL ATTACKS? EVENTS -- AND SO. IF WE IF IF WE STILL HAVE TECHNICAL TERMINATION AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES NOT THAT AGAIN IS GOING TO CAUSE TAXPAYERS TO KEEP TWO SETS OF BOOKS -- ONE FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ONE FOR THE STATE. THE THIRD ITEM -- NOW WITH THAT WE WOULD STILL WITH THE WEED CONFORM TO IS A LIMITATION ON A LIKE KIND EXCHANGE IS. UNDER PRIOR FEDERALLY KERN ST LOS CERTAIN TYPES OF REAL OR PERSONAL PROPERTY ARE SOLD. THE GAIN ON THE SALE OF THAT ASSET IS DEFERRED FOR TAX PURPOSES. IF IT IS EXCHANGE FOR LIKE KIND US. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT UNDER THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT A RESTRICTED THE USE OF LIKEN EXCHANGES. TO THOSE DEFERRALS TO ONLY REAL PROPERTY AND WE WE WERE PROPOSING TO CAN TO CONFORM TO THAT SAME PROVISION. THE FOURTH ITEM PERTAINS TO EMPLOYEE FRINGE BENEFITS THAT ARE PROVIDED BY BUSINESSES BUT ARE NOT TAX TO THE EMPLOYEE. THE FEDERAL TAX LAW LIMITED THE ABILITY OF BUSINESSES TO DETECT THESE TYPE OF EXPENSES. OF PERTAINING TO SEE TO CERTAIN MEALS AND ENTERTAINMENT AND TO TRANSPORTATION BENEFITS. THE FIFTH AUTUMN MARLYS IS CHANGING THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF EXCESSIVE COMPENSATION -- TO TALKING PLEASE BY PUBLIC CORPORATIONS. FOR PRIOR FEDERAL IN CURRENT STATE LAW. PAYMENTS ARE MADE TO CERTAIN TOP EMPLOYEES THAT EXCEEDED MILLION DOLLARS. COULD NOT BE DEDUCTED BY THE EMPLOYER AND THAT EXCLUDED -- PAYMENTS MADE THROUGH IMPROVE PERFORMANCE BASED OF OF CONTRACTS. THE FEDERAL BILL LIMITED THE EXCEPTION IMAGE BASED PAYMENTS AND EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF COVERED -- EMPLOYEES FROM FORTY FIVE WE WOULD WE WOULD -- WE PROPOSE CONFORM TO THOSE THAT PROVISION. THE SIXTH AND SEVENTH ITEM SUPPLIED ABLE ACCOUNTS. ABEL ACCOUNTS WERE CHEATING A BETTER LIFE EXPERIENCE ACCOUNTS. WERE PERMITTED BY FEDERAL LAW IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN IS A TAX ADVANTAGED SAVINGS ACCOUNT. FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES. CALIFORNIA CONFORM TO THE ABLE COUNT. THE THE TAX ACT OF TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THE FEDERAL TAX SECOND. TWO SEVEN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EXPANDED THESE ACCOUNTS. A BY ALLOWING BENEFICIARIES TO CONTRIBUTE UP TO THE POVERTY LEVEL ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. TO ENABLE ACCOUNT. IN ADDITION THE FEDERAL LAW ALLOWED FIVE TWENTY NINE COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS TO BE ROLLED OVER INTO ABLE ACCOUNTS -- AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE KEEP. OF RULES FOR QUALIFIED SAVINGS ACCOUNT THE SAME SO THAT A TAXPAYER DOESN'T END UP HAVING A DISQUALIFIED CALIFORNIA ACCOUNT. JUST BECAUSE THE FOLLOWING FEDERAL RULES. THE EIGHTH ITEM WOULD LIMIT THE ABILITY OF INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYERS TO USE BUSINESS LOSSES TO OFFSET NON BUSINESS INCOME. THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT ONLY ALLOWS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OF BUSINESS LOSSES OR FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR MARRIED TAXPAYERS. TO BE USED AS AN OFFSET AGAINST NON BUSINESS INCOME. SUCH AS WAGES INTEREST DIVIDENDS AND CAPITAL GAINS. LOSSES ABOVE THE 200-500-00500 THOUSAND DOLLAR THRESHOLD CAN BE USED TO OFFSET INCOME IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS. THIS PROVISION IS A GOOD POLICY BECAUSE PROVIDES TAXPAYERS FROM FROM USING LOSSES THAT ARE SOMETIMES JUST PAPER LOSSES. TO OFFSET ACTUAL INCOME. AND I THOUGHT ITEM IS A LIMITATION ON THE DIRECTION OF FTA SEE PREMIUMS. FTA SEEP FTA SHE PREMIUMS WHICH ARE PREMIUMS PAID BY BANKS TO INSURE DEPOSITS ARE GENERALLY DEDUCTIBLE. THE FEDERAL TAX THE NEW FEDERAL TAX LAW CHANGE THAT SO THAT -- FOR LARGE BANKS THOSE WITHOUT SUCH OVER FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DEDUCT THEIR FTA SEE PREMIUMS. AND FOR THOSE WITH A FOR BANKS WITH ASSETS BETWEEN TEN BILLION IN FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS. THEIR THEIR OF THEIR ABILITY SINCE HIS FACE OUT OVER THAT RANGE. THE TENTH ITEM IS THE ELIMINATION OF A OF A SEPARATE SECTION THREE THIRTY EIGHT ELECTION. SECTION THREE THIRTY EIGHT WAS ENACTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO TO ALLOW TAXPAYER THE PURCHASES HE CORPORATION. TO TREAT A PORTRAIT OF A PURCHASE OF THE CORPORATION STOCK AS A PURCHASE INSTEAD OF THE ASSETS OF THE CORPORATION. THIS SELECTION CAN HAVE TAX CONSEQUENCES BECAUSE STOCK SALES MAY BE ASSIGNED TO STATES IN A DIFFERENT WAY THAN THEMSELVES OF ASSETS ARE SIGNED. BY ALLOWING SECTION THREE A SEPARATE SECTION THREE THIRTY ELECTION FOR STATE PURPOSES. THAT DIFFERS FROM THE FEDERAL ELECTION HE CREATES A POSSIBILITY UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES FOR INCOME TO BE VOID BEING TAXED BY ANY STATE. WE PROPOSE REQUIRING TAXPAYERS TO MAKE THE SAME ELECTION FOR CALIFORNIA THAT THEY MAKE FOR FEDERAL PURPOSES. THE ELEVENTH ITEMS OPPORTUNITIES OWN SOME TAKE A LITTLE MORE TIME TO GO INTO THIS IS A LOW OF AND BECAUSE MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT ABOUT THIS. SO JUST TO GIVE YOU SOME BACKGROUND TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT CREATED OPPORTUNITIES OWNS. ALL STATES WERE ALLOWED TO DESIGNATE OPPORTUNITIESOWNS IN CERTAIN ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED AREAS WITHIN THE STATE. CALIFORNIA PARTICIPATED IN THE PROCESS. AND LAST SPRING WE DESIGNATED EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE OPPORTUNITIES OWNS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES OWNS IS ENCOURAGED -- BY SEVERAL FEDERAL TAX INCENTIVES. THE FIRST INCENTIVE. IS A TEMPORARY DEFERRAL OF ANY CAPITAL -- IF THOSE GAINS ARE INVESTED IN OPPORTUNITIES AND FUND -- AND OF IF IF IF THEY'RE INVESTED IN OPPORTUNITIES ON FUND WITHIN HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS OF THE OF THE SALE OF THE OF THE ASSET. ALL OF THE DEFERRED GAINS MUST BE REALIZED I'M SORRY IF THE GAMES ARE HELD FOR SEVEN YEARS -- THERE HELD FOR FIVE YEARS A TAXPAYER ALSO RECEIVES A 10% EXEMPTION WHEN THE GAME IS FINALLY -- TAXABLE AND THE GAME ITSELF FOR SEVEN YEARS THE TAXPAYER WOULD RECEIVE A 15% EXEMPTION WHEN THE GAIN IS HAS FINALLY TAXABLE. IN ADDITION -- HELLO AND AND ALL ALL THE GAMES MUST BE REALIZE. BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY SIX IN ADDITION ANY GAMES THAT ARE THE EARNED -- BY THOSE INVESTMENTS IN THE OPPORTUNITIES OWN FUND ARE TAX FREE IF THEY'RE HELD FOR TEN YEARS OR MORE. WE ARE PROPOSING TO CONFORM TO THESE AND TAX INCENTIVES FOR INVESTMENT AND OPPORTUNITIES AND FUND. THAT ARE DIRECTED PROJECTS THAT ARE BOTH WITHIN A CALIFORNIA OPPORTUNITIES OWN. AND ARE A QUALIFY TYPE OF INVESTMENT. AND A QUALIFIED TO INVESTMENT WOULD BE WHAT AND INVESTMENT IN. LOW INCOME HOUSING CLEAN TECHNOLOGY OR GREEN JOBS. BECAUSE OF THE GENEROUS FEDERAL TAX BREAKS IT SEEMS VERY LIKELY THAT INVESTMENT DOLLARS WILL BE FLOWING IN TOP PURSUIT OPPORTUNITY ZONES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. THE PURPOSE FOR PROPOSED CONFORMITY IS TO PROVIDE AN INCENTIVE FOR INVESTORS TO INVEST THOSE OPPORTUNITIES OWN. DOLLARS INTO CALIFORNIA OPPORTUNITIES OWNS AND PROVIDE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BENEFITS TO CALIFORNIANS. AND WE HAVE AND WE WANT TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT ENCOURAGES THE RIGHT TYPE OF INVESTMENT THAT ACTUALLY DOES BENEFIT CALIFORNIA. AND THE CALIFORNIANS WHO LIVE AND WORK IN ECONOMIC AREAS. SO MOVE ON TO ITEM -- TWELVE WHICH IS THE ELIMINATION OF NET OPERATING LOSS CARRY BACKS. GENERALLY WHEN A TEXTURE HAS A HAS A LOSS. IN ONE YEAR THEY CAN USE THAT LOST OFFSET GAINS IN OTHER YEARS UNDER -- PRIOR FEDERAL LAW AND CURRENT STATE LAW. TEXTURES WERE ALLOWED TO CARRY BACK. HE LOST A TWO YEARS TO TWO MEN PRIOR YEAR RETURNS AND USE THOSE LOSSES TO OFFSET INCOME IN THOSE YEARS -- AND ALTERNATIVELY -- OR HELP THE ELDERLY THEY COULD CARRY THOSE LOSSES FORD FOR TWENTY YEARS AND OFFSET INCOME IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS -- THAT IS UNTIL THE THE LOSSES HAVE BEEN USED UP OFFSETTING GAINS INCOME. THE NEW FEDERAL LAW ELIMINATES THE ABILITY TO CARRY BACK LOSSES. AND IT -- AND IT LIMITS THE USE OF NET OPERATING LOSS CARRY FORWARDS. SO THAT THEY CAN ALSO NO MORE THAN 80% OF THE CURRENT INCOME AND ANYONE IN ANY ONE YEAR. THE FEDERAL LAW CHANGE ALSO REPLACE THE TWENTY YEAR CARRY FOR LIMIT WITH AN UNLIMITED CARRY FORWARD PERIOD. WE ARE PROPOSING CONFORMITY JUST TO THE LOS KERRY BACK PROVISION TO THE ELIMINATION OF LOS KERRY BACK PROVISION. THE FINAL ITEM ON OUR LIST RELATES TO THE TREATMENT OF STUDENT LOANS DISCHARGED ON ACCOUNT OF DISABILITY OR DEATH. GENERALLY FORGIVENESS OF A LOAN IS TREATED AS INCOME TO THE TRIP TO THE PERSON WHO'S DEBT IS FORGIVEN. UNDER THE NEW FEDERAL LAW ANY STUDENT DEBT THAT IS FORGIVEN ON ACCOUNT OF DISABILITY OR DEATH. IS NOT CONSIDERED INCOME. WE PROPOSED TO CONFORM TO CONFORM TO THIS TREATMENT. SO JUST A COUPLE CONCLUDING STATEMENTS IF YOU LOOK AT THE ESTIMATED REVENUE IMPACT. ON ON PAGE FOR YOU KNOW NEWS OVER ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION IN. A NINETEEN TWENTY AND AND ALMOST ONE POINT FOUR BILLION IN. TWENTY TWENTY ONE THESE ESTIMATES ARE STILL JUST ESTIMATES WE WERE ARE STILL WORK WITH FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO MAKE SURE THE ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE REFER REFLECTION OF WHAT WE CAN EXPECT OF FROM CONFORMITY WITH THE FOR THESE IN THE WAY THAT WE ARE CONFORMING TO THESE ITEMS. ARE THE FINAL NUMBERS MAY BE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT OF WHAT WE SHOW HERE. BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE SUFFICIENT REVENUE TO PAY FOR THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT PROGRAM SO THAT WE CAN MAINTAIN BUDGET RESILIENCY. FINALLY -- JUST ABOUT LANGUAGE AND WE UNFORTUNATELY DO NOT HAVE ANY. POSTED YET BUT WE WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH LET'S COUNCIL -- TO TO GET THAT DRAFTED HIM AND WE HOPE TO HAVE. ORANGE POSTED SOON AND I AND I HOPE TO HAVE EVERYTHING -- AVAILABLE BY EARLY APRIL. THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS AND HAPPY TO HELP YOU QUICKLY IT WAS BURKE. SO I HAVE A QUESTION ON THE ESTIMATED NEXT NET CHANGE IN REVENUE IT STARTS AT ONE POINT SEVEN BUT THAT IT GOES DOWN TO ONE POINT FOUR I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS WHY THE REDUCTION IN THE SECOND QUESTION IS DOES THAT CONTINUE TO REDUCE -- THE REDUCTION IS GENERALLY BECAUSE WHEN WE CAN FOR CONFORMING. AS A ONE ONE NINETEEN AND AND BUT WORKING FOR ME AT THE END OF EIGHTEEN NINETY SO NONE OF THE NONE OF THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN REVENUE CAN SHOW OPEN TO IN. EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IT'S ALL GONNA SHOW FOR NINETEEN TWENTIES OF CENTURY NINETY TWENTY EFFECTS OF DOUBLING UP OKAY SO I'M NOT SAYING THAT WOULD STAY IDENTICALLY AT ONE POINT FOUR THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT CHANGE OVER TIME BUT WE GENERALLY EXPECT THE NUMBER TO BE AROUND ONE POINT FOUR LIVING. COMING OUT [inaudible] LL. OKAY HI JUSTIN GROSSI LA -- I'M GONNA TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT THE E. H. PROPOSED THE EIGHTIES AND WEATHER FOR IS GONNA TALK ABOUT CONFORMITY. K. ON THE E. I. T. C. EXPANSION FIRST YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT SORT OF THE BENEFITS AND YOU KNOW WHO'S GOING TO BENEFIT AND HOW MUCH. SO IF YOU WOULD TURN TO PAGE TWO OF THE HEARING AGENDA. THERE IS A LINE GRAPH THAT YOU KNOW SHOWS HOW MUCH PEOPLE WERE HOW MUCH THAT. FILERS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE EIGHTY SI YOU'RE GOING TO GET IT EACH INCOME LEVEL. SO IF YOU SEE ARM WELL FIRST OF ALL EACH AS IT THE GRAPH SHOWS EVERY FILER WITH AT LEAST ONE DEPENDENT UNDER AGE. SIX IS GOING TO GET FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AS LONG AS YOU HAVE AT LEAST ONE DOLLAR OF EARNED INCOME. IF YOUR INCOME IS IN THE RANGE BETWEEN TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IT PHASES OUT TO AVOID A CLIFF AT THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS -- THIS THE MORE COMPLICATED PIECE OF THE PROPOSED EXPANSION IF YOU NOTICE -- THE PHASE OUT RANGE OF THE E. I. T. C. OVER WHICH YOUR E. I. T. C. M.. ABOUT DECLINES AS THEIR INCOME RISES NOTICE THERE'S A KINK IN IT. SO UNDER CURRENT LAW. FOR FILER WITH TWO DEPENDENTS THAT KINK COMES AT ABOUT FOURTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OF INCOME. UNDER THIS PROPOSAL -- PEOPLE WHOSE INCOME IS YOU'RE JUST BELOW THE KINK -- TO YOU KNOW IF A FAIR AMOUNT ABOVE IT WILL GET THE BIGGEST BENEFITS. BUT IF YOUR INCOME IF YOUR CURRENT. INCOME IS TOO FAR BELOW THE KINK AMOUNT YOU DON'T GET A BENEFIT FROM THIS PROPOSAL UNLESS YOU HAVE IT AT LEAST ONE DEPENDENT UNDER THE AGE OF SIX NOW THIS CRAFT SHOWS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IF YOU HAVE TO DEPENDENCE. IF YOU HAVE ONE DEPENDENT THAT KING COMES IN ABOUT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OF INCOME SO PEOPLE YEAH WITH INCOME FROM ROUGHLY TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO A LITTLE MORE WILL SEE THE BIGGEST BENEFITS. IF YOU HAVE NO DEPENDENTS THAT KING COMES BETWEEN FIVE THOUSAND AND SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS OF INCOME. BUT THE AMOUNTS THAT YOU GET IF YOU HAVE NO DEPENDENTS ARE VERY SMALL TO BEGIN WITH AND SO THE THE BENNETT THE INCREASE YOU WOULD GET FROM THIS EXPANSION IS ALSO FAIRLY SMALL. OKAY -- I LIKE TO TURN TO THE CRITERIA THAT OUR OFFICE USES TO EVALUATE YEAH I SEE PURPLE YEAH A T. C. PROPOSALS. FIRST OF ALL WE LOOK AT THE WE THE EFFECT THAT WE THINK THE PROPOSAL HAVE ON POVERTY IN THE STATE. FOR ANY EIGHTY SEE EXPANSION OF ANY GIVEN SIZE THERE'S A TRADE OFF BETWEEN HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU CAN REACH AND HOW MUCH HELP YOU CAN GET GIVE THE EACH A BENEFICIARY. THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL TENDS TO GO AS OPPOSED TO GOING DEEP BECAUSE IT IT REACHES A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH INCOME BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL OR NOT MUCH ABOVE IT. BUT IT DOESN'T GIVE THEM MAKE A HUGE AMOUNT -- AND IT ALSO IF YOU LOOK AT THE IF YOU LOOK AT THE LINE GRAPH AGAIN IT DOESN'T GIVE A WHOLE LOT TO PEOPLE WHOSE INCOME. UP BACK UP IT DOESN'T GIVE A WHOLE LOT TO THE THE ELIGIBLE FILERS WITH THE LOWEST INCOMES IT GIVES MORE TO THE PEOPLE SORT OF AT THE UPPER END OF THE ELIGIBLE. RANGE. SEC THE SECOND THING WE LOOK AT IS THE PROPOSALS AFFECT ON WORK FORCE PARTICIPATION. NOW THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE EITC. HAS A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IN TERMS OF INDUCING PEOPLE TO JOIN THE WORK FORCE. HOWEVER IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON THE HOURS WORKED OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY IN THE WORK FORCE. AND SO THIS PROPOSAL WE EXPECT WOULD PROBABLY NOT HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON OF PEOPLE'S WORK PARTICIPATION. MOSTLY BECAUSE IT CONCENTRATES THE BENEFIT TOWARD THE TAIL END OF THE ELIGIBLE INCOME RANGE FOR THE EFFECT ON PEOPLE'S WORK HOURS IS GENERALLY SMALLER. OKAY FINALLY OUR OUR ROUTE REPORT THAT WE PUT OUT A FEW DAYS AGO. SUGGEST SOME POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVES THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD PURSUE. IF THEY WERE MORE INTERESTED IN TARGETING THE IN TOWARD -- RELIEVING DEEP POVERTY OR TOWARD ENCOURAGING WORK WE ALSO DISCUSSED SOME POSSIBILITIES FOR PROVIDING THE CREDIT ON A MONTHLY BASIS TO RECIPIENTS. AND WE'D BE HAPPY. TO TAKE QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT IF YOU'RE INTERESTED. THANK YOU MISS BURKE. I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS -- ONE AND AND I THINK. ON THE WORK WE DO ON POVERTY OBVIOUSLY AT THE HOPE IS THAT IT COMES OUT ON A MONTHLY BASIS I THINK OUR STE OUR STUDY HAS SHOWN THAT THAT IS A BETTER OPTION HOWEVER I AM CURIOUS. ABOUT HOW MUCH WHEN YOU SAY THAT THERE IS THAT IT'S NOT THAT THE ITC IS NOT ENCOURAGING NECESSARILY THE GROWTH OF OUR IS HOW MUCH OF THAT IS AN ACTUAL RESULT THAT YOU BELIEVE OF THE ACTUAL CREDIT VERSES. THE THRESHOLD IN WHICH PEOPLE IT HIT A CERTAIN THRESHOLD AND THEN THE OTHER SERVICES ARE INTERRUPTED. OKAY WHAT AT THE NEXUS OF THAT YEAH THERE IS THERE ONE OF THE CONCERNS PEOPLE HAVE WITH THE I. T. C. IS YOU BECAUSE THE BENEFIT PHASES OUT AS PEOPLE'S INCOME RISES OVER THAT. PHASE OUT RANGE THAT ALSO COINCIDES WITH THEM AS YOU SAID. A NUMBER OF OTHER PROGRAMS THE THE THE BENEFITS FROM THOSE TAPER OFF OF YOUR INCOME RISES TO AND SO THAT'S THAT'S YOU THAT IS A CONCERN YOU HAVE WITH THE E. I. T. C.. IN PRACTICE THOUGH THE THE MARGIN THAT TENDS TO MATTER MOST IS FOR ANY GIVEN WORKER -- BASICALLY THE AMOUNT OF AFTER TAX INCOME. THEY WOULD GET FROM WORKING SAY TWENTY HOURS A WEEK AS OPPOSED. TO FORTY BECAUSE THAT'S SUCH A PRETTY YOU KNOW. A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT DISCREET JOB FOR MOST PEOPLE AS IT TURNS OUT. THE THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES THEY FACE WHEN YOU COMBINE BOTH THE A. T. C. ANOTHER MEANS TESTED PROGRAMS. IT TENDS NOT TO BE ENOUGH TO HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON WORK EFFORT I MEAN. PEOPLE'S. PEOPLE'S WORKFORCE PARTICIPATION ESPECIALLY AMONG SECOND EARNERS IN THE HOUSEHOLD IS YELLS IT IS SENSITIVE TO THE THE CHANGE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE THE FACE BUT NO BECAUSE USE THIS IS STILL YOUR RETAINING GIVES. A SIGNIFICANT CHUNK OF THE X. FOR PRE TAX EARNINGS THEY FIND THAT THE IMPACT ON THE HOURS THAT PEOPLE WORK IS ACTUALLY NOT THAT HIGH IN SO [inaudible] THE ANOTHER WAY TO THINK ABOUT THAT IS SORT OF THE WORRIES THAT PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT THE EITC DISCOURAGING WORK IN THE PHASE OUT RANGE -- IT TURNS OUT NOT TO ACTUALLY BE THAT BAD IN THOSE TERMS THIS WEEK'S. I'M. SORRY THOSE ALLOWED -- I'M A BIG SUPPORTER OF THE I. T. C. -- I THINK IT'S ONE WAY WE CAN DEAL WITH THE CHI RISING INCOME INEQUALITY ESPECIALLY WITH THE COST OF HOUSING. IN FACT I THINK WE SHOULD EXPAND UTC TO INCLUDE -- UNPAID -- CARE GIVERS -- ANYONE IS A CARE GIVER KNOWS HOW HARD THAT WORK IS -- BUT ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I HAD FOR YOU ABOUT THE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS MY UNDERSTANDING OF THIS -- PROPOSAL DOES NOT ALLOW FOR TAXPAYERS THAT NUMBERS TO CLAIM BENEFITS -- AND WITHOUT THIS ABOUT ONE POINT ONE MILLION FAMILIES AND WILL NOT BE ABLE -- TO TO CLAIM THAT CREDIT WHICH I VIEW THIS AS AN ISSUE OF YOU KNOW FAIRNESS AND EQUITY. A WHAT'S THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS -- SO YEAH I I'VE BEEN TO IT WAS NOT AN ORIGINAL PROPOSAL WE WE'VE -- WE'VE HEARD FROM ADVOCATES AND AND THAT SORT SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE FEASIBILITY OF DOING I MEAN IT IS NOT. AS STRAIGHTFORWARD AS AS AS PRIDE IN EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT TO TAXPAYERS WITH WITH SO SECURITY NUMBERS BUT SOMETHING WE'RE LOOKING INTO -- BUT IT WOULD HAVE TO FIT WITHIN THE THE BUDGETARY FRAMEWORK. A QUESTION ON WHAT OUTCOMES FOR LOW INCOME WORKING FAMILIES DO YOU EXPECT TO SEE. THIS PROPOSED EXPANSION OF CAL U. ET I SEE. I'M SORRY WHAT TO WHAT WHAT OUTCOMES FOR LOW INCOME WORKING FAMILIES DO YOU EXPECT TO SEE FROM PROPOSAL. PROPOSED EXPANSION WELL I DON'T THE ITC YEAH WHAT WHAT WE ARE WHAT -- WHAT WE EXPECT TO SEE IS THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE MORE FAMILIES GETTING MORE DOLLARS TO HELP THEM? DEAL WITH. UP FINANCIAL STRESS. TO ALMOST DOUBLING THE AMOUNT -- WE WERE BE A MORE THAN DOUBLING THE NOW THIS IS GO FOR SEVENTEEN TO THIRTY RIGHT. THIRTY MILLION OLD I'M SORRY THAT THE THE MAXIMUM INCORRECT YES YES YES RIGHT EXACTLY YEAH FOR FOR FOR A HOUSEHOLD WITH NO DEPENDENTS HAMMY FOLKS DO YOU THINK THEY'LL LET HOW MANY MORE FAMILIES WILL LET IN. THAT -- THAT IS EXPECTED -- BOTH FAMILIES WITH -- TEXTURES WITH DEPENDENTS AND WITHOUT TO MANAGE IT SHOULD BRING IN ABOUT ANOTHER MILLION HOUSEHOLDS [inaudible] MR. TO A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS I WILL FOLLOW UP ON WHAT. MISS WICKS JUST ASKED AROUND I TO NUMBER SO. IS THERE ANY REAL JUSTIFICATION FOR NOT INCLUDING ALL TAX FILERS -- YOU SORT OF ALLUDED TO THE FACT THAT THERE MIGHT BE A DIFFERENCE AND I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE. WHAT THE REAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SOMEONE WHO FILES WITH AN AYE TEN VERSES SO SECURITY NUMBER? ON I I DON'T KNOW THAT I CAN. DRESS THAT COMPLETELY -- I I THINK I THINK GENERAL THE EITC WE'VE BEEN -- IT'S BEEN A SUBSET OF THE OF THE FEDERAL PROGRAM. AND AND TEXTURES WITH AYE TENS AND ALLOWED THE HC AND FEDERAL PROGRAM. LAST YEAR WE WE DID MAKE A BREAK FROM THE FEDERAL PROGRAM THAT WE ALLOWED IT -- TO TAXPAYERS OVER -- SIXTY FIVE IN AND UNDER -- UNDER TWENTY FIVE WITHOUT DEPENDENT SO WE HAVE WE HAVE MADE THAT THAT BREAK BUT I'D SAY GENERALLY THE THE STARTING POINT IS. YOU WERE WE WOULD LIKE TO KEEP IT CONSISTS WITH FEDERAL PROGRAM BECAUSE IT MAKES IT EASIER TO ADMINISTER -- AND AND BUT I I I DON'T KNOW THAT I CAN. I'VE I HAVEN'T I DON'T HAVE A GOOD ANSWERS TO WHAT SORT OF HURDLES THERE MAY BE -- TO TO PROVIDING -- AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE LOOKING INTO WHO TOOK. GREAT IF WE COULD GET SOME ANALYSIS ABOUT IT SEEMS TO ME AS MS WOODS SAID -- THAT THE IDEA THAT ONE CATEGORY WOULD RECEIVE THIS IN ANOTHER CATEGORY WOULDN'T DOESN'T FEEL FAIR DOESN'T FEEL EQUITABLE. HAVE TO BE DOES COLLECT TAXES FROM PEOPLE WITH AYE TENNIS BUT YOU'RE SAYING THAT WE CAN'T GIVE REFUNDS TO THOSE SAME FILERS. THAT'S WELL I AND AND I THE OTHER THING TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THERE IS A BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS SO WE CAN'T. AND AND I THINK WE DO HAVE AN S. WITH THE DOLLARS TO PROVIDE. TO FIGHT THE ATC TO TAXPAYERS WITH TITANS. IT SO BUT WHAT I'M HERE AND IT'S A ADMINISTRATIVE THERE'S NOT A THERE'S NOT AT TAX EQUITY REASON THAT I YEAH I I I I I I I CAN'T THINK OF A TAX EQUITY REASON. MORE BUDGETARY AND AND ADMINISTRATIVE -- COULD I SHOULD THE CONVERSATION -- TO THE PEOPLE'S AROUND IMPLEMENTING MONTHLY PAYMENTS -- COULD YOU GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT IF TO BE HAS SAID AS FAR AS WHAT TYPE OF ISSUES WOULD NEED TO BE FIGURED OUT TO IMPLEMENT. MONTHLY DISBURSEMENT -- HOW LONG WOULD THAT TAKE WHAT'S A REALISTIC TIME FRAME FOR FOR DOING THAT? YEAH WE WE ARE STILL EARLY IN THE PROCESS OF OF DETERMINING HOW THAT HOW THAT WOULD WORK -- THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE PROBLEM WITH WITH AN ADMINISTRATION MONTHLY PAYMENTS IN ADVANCE. IS THAT -- YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH. EITC HOUSEHOLD IS GOING TO EARN HER IS GOING TO HE'S GOING TO EARN -- AND YOU. WON A SECOND JOB AT THE END OF THE YEAR THAT BRINGS IN A COUPLE THOUSAND DOLLARS COULD CHANGE RE H. C. DRAMATICALLY BECAUSE WE'VE GOT -- YOU KNOW THE FEDERAL THE FEDERAL TAX THE EIGHTY SI HAS MORE OF A IF YOU KNOW IT IT INCREASES FOR ALL THAT IT PLATEAUS AND THEN IT DROPS OFF. AND SO THERE LOOK. FOR THAT PROGRAM IS A LITTLE MORE -- WILL YOU NOT SO SUSCEPTIBLE TO HAVING SMALL CHANGES IN INCOME DROPPED DRAMATICALLY CHANGE HE EIGHTY SO THAT SO THERE'S THERE'S A PROBLEM. SO I'LL JUST SAY THAT'S A PROBLEM THAT WERE THAT WERE TRYING TO SEE HOW WE CAN OVERCOME THAT -- WAYS THAT WE CAN BECAUSE THAT IS CERTAINLY SOME THE GOVERNOR HAS -- HAS HAS. SAID THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT THAT WE'RE WE'RE GOING AND WE ARE EXPLORING WAYS TO DO THAT. BUT AT THIS POINT. HI I AM THAT SAID THERE IS TO SEE HE CONCEPTUALLY A PROBLEM WITH KNOWING BEFORE HAND HOW MUCH EARNED INCOME TAX READ. TEXTURES GOING TO EARN AND WE DO KNOW THAT PEOPLE TEND TO MOVE IN AND OUT OF THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT -- FAIRLY DRAMATICALLY FROM YEAR TO YEAR SO THEY DON'T AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE SAME EXACT EXACT SAME PEOPLE. GETTING THE HC CHEERS SO YOU CAN'T JUST RELY ON WHAT THEY GOT LAST YEAR -- FOR WHAT THEY'LL GET TAX YEAR OKAY -- THIRD TOPIC -- I WAS CONSIDERING THIS YOU'RE MOVING THE BILL FOR AROUND THE TOPIC OF AUTOMATIC FILING AND I WANTED TO GET A SENSE. I KNOW IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS CALIFORNIA HAD A READY RETURN PROGRAM. AND WONDERING HAS THERE BEEN A CONVERSATION ABOUT REVIVING THAT MODEL FOR THE EIGHTIES SEE ELIGIBLE HOUSEHOLDS -- I'M THERE THERE ISN'T THERE'S NOT BEEN A CONVERSATION AS YET. CERTAINLY THAT'S SOMETHING WE COULD LOOK INTO IF THIRTY SOMETHING YEAR -- LOVE TO GETS MORE EDUCATION OKAY YEP TO GET MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT AND WE CAN COLLEAGUES WHAT WHAT THAT REALLY ADDRESSES THE FACT THAT. THERE ARE MANY INDIVIDUALS WHO DO NOT OWE TAXES YOU DON'T HAVE A REASON A FILE BUT THUS THEY DON'T GET THE REFUNDABLE CREDIT SO THE IDEA IS HOW DO WE CAPTURE THAT GROUP OF FOLKS -- LESSER QUESTIONS I HAVE -- AND I WOULD PROPOSES TO EITHER NOW THE ADMINISTRATION OR TO THE LA -- IS -- WE TALKED ABOUT -- THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION TO HOUSEHOLDS WITH. KIDS I'M WONDERING HAS THERE BEEN ANALYSIS OF HOW THIS CREDIT WOULD AFFECT CHILDREN IN DEEP POVERTY. THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST AND CHAIRWOMAN OF OUR PROTECT HIM HE'S BEEN LEADING ON THAT AND I THINK MANY OF US ARE INTERESTED IN WHAT THAT IMPACT WOULD BE -- THE MULTIPLIER EFFECTS HOW WE CAN JUSTIFY THIS -- I MEAN I I I I CAN'T I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT I'VE DONE A OF AN ANALYSIS OF THAT OTHER THAN THAT IT WOULD IT CERTAINLY WOULD PROVIDE -- FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS WHICH WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT HELP TO THOSE HOUSEHOLDS DO WE KNOW FOR LA -- HAVE YOU DONE ANY ADDITIONAL ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE. BUT WE HAVEN'T TRIED TO DO ANY SORT OF MODEL LIKE HOW MIGHT THAT IT. THAT MIGHT AFFECT THE ECONOMY IN OTHER WAYS OR HOW WOULD YOU KNOW. WHAT AFFECT OTHER OUTCOMES FOR THEM BUT WE HAVE SORT OF RUN ESTIMATES OF HOW MANY PEOPLE IN DEEP POVERTY READ BE AFFECTED BY -- THE ADMINISTRATION'S FOR PROPOSAL AND BY SOME OF THE ALTERNATIVES WE TALKED ABOUT. TO COULD YOU GET THAT INFORMATION TO US. I WOULD NEED MORE OF A SPECIFIC A QUESTION LIKE -- WHAT SPECIFICALLY YOU WANT US TO ESTIMATE -- TRY TO LOOK INTO IF YOU SAID YOU RAN SOME MODELS ON THE IMPACT OF THIS -- ANOTHER FAMILIES AND THE POVERTY YEAH WE DID -- IN OUR REPORT WE TALK ABOUT THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE -- WHO WOULD BE MOVED OUT OF POVERTY OR OUT OF DEEP POVERTY -- UNDER THE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND UNDER OF ONE OF OUR ALTERNATIVES. OKAY. AND THE FINAL QUESTION HAS THERE BEEN ANY ANALYSIS OF HOW MANY CARE GIVERS OF ADULTS COULD BE ELIGIBLE IF WE EXTENDED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO CARE FOR DEPENDENT ELDERLY FOR ADULT FAMILY MEMBERS SO THE IDEA OF NOT JUST IN CARE KIDS TO TAKE CARE OF SENIORS. GIVEN THE SILVER SYNONYME GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW OF THE NUMBERS THAT ARE COMING UP AND HOW CHALLENGING THE SITUATION IS FOR FAMILIES -- I BUT I BELIEVE THAT IT'S I BELIEVE THAT SOME POINT I'VE I'VE ASKED A QUESTION I BUT I DON'T I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER RIGHT NOW BUT I CAN GET BACK TO YOU. WHO WOULD YOU WHO? LOVE FOR YOU TO GET BACK TO US ON THAT. APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. THIS BURKE SURE JUST BACK TO A SIMILAR CHOOSE QUESTION SOMEWHERE IN ONE OF THE REPORTS A FEELING I REMEMBER AS STATEMENT ABOUT THAT THE WAY THAT THE SYSTEM AS PROPOSED IS DESIGNED IS THAT IT WILL BRING SMALLER AMOUNT OF DOLLARS TO MORE PEOPLE HOWEVER LIFT. LESS INDIVIDUALS OUT OF POVERTY POVERTY IS THAT RIGHT YEAH. YES YES OKAY SO SO THE THE THE WAY -- HUNTER WAS ADDRESS L. ELLIE OKAY. WELL IT IS ONE YEAH SO SO THE WAY THE THE THE ITC WAS ORIGINALLY STRUCTURED IT WAS IT WAS A FOCUSED ON ON THE LOWEST INCOME TAXPAYERS THE INTERFACE OUT OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH IS LIKE A QUARTER OF WHERE THE FEDERAL EITC PHASE OUT. AS WE'VE BEEN -- INCREASING OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. IT'S BEEN INCREASED -- WE'VE BEEN INCREASING IT. FOR UPPER INCOME. TAXPAYERS NOT HIGH INCOME BUT BUT AT THE SOMEWHAT HIGHER THE SO -- BUT WHAT WE'VE BEEN GIVING TO THOSE HOUSEHOLDS IS FAIRLY MEAGER AMOUNTS YOU KNOW AND SO WHAT WE'VE WHAT WHAT WE'VE BEEN FOCUSING ON IS TRYING. TO BUILD UP THAT THE H. C. STRUCTURE SO THAT THERE CAN THOSE. THOSE HOUSEHOLDS ARE GETTING A A A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT FROM THE ATC. SO THAT WAS THE ADJUSTMENT IN THE P. BECAUSE ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO DESCRIBE TO ME AT THIS PROPOSAL IMPACT WOULD BE BROAD NOT DEEP -- AND SO IS THAT THE REASONING FOR SOME OF THE ADJUSTMENTS IN WHERE THE PEAK WOULD BE ON THIS ON THE GRAPH THAT YOU DIDN'T DO THIS CRAP I THINK YOU DID THIS CRAFT. THE KNOWLEDGE OF IT'S THE IT'S ON YOUR AT CRAP THAT'S ON PAGE TWO OF THE ASSEMBLY THE AGENDA OKAY. YES -- CAROLINE TO FROM LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THAT THE FIGURE YOU'RE REFERRING TO IS FROM OUR REPORT ON AND SPECIFICALLY IN TERMS OF THE IMPACT ON DEEP. FAMILIES MOVING FROM DEEP POVERTY OR OUT OF POVERTY DEEP POVERTY BEING 50% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- MOVES ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND FAMILIES OUT OF DEEP POVERTY MAJORITY OF THOSE ARE LIKELY FAMILIES THAT WOULD BE RECEIVING THE EXTRA FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR CREDIT BUT WE CAN DIG INTO THAT. FOR YOU MORE -- TO TO GET A BETTER AND THEN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL MOVES FIFTY THOUSAND FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY SPECIFICALLY -- SO IT DOES HAVE A BIGGER PUSH OF TWO FAMILIES FROM ONE SIDE OF THE POVERTY THRESHOLD VERSES THE DEEP POVERTY THRESHOLD. AND DO WE HAVE ANY REASONING WHY WE CHOSE. TO MOVE THE PEOPLE WHO LEAVE THE TWELVE THOUSAND I MEAN SO IT'S LIKE FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND RIGHT IN DEEP POVERTY RIGHT NOW HOW DID WE CHOOSE TO THE ONLY TWELVE THOUSAND OF THOSE AFFECTED HIM FIFTY THOUSAND OUT OF POVERTY. AND I A I WOULD GO GO BACK -- TO WE HAVE LEARNED OBVIOUSLY LIMITED BUDGETARY RESIDE GET THAT AND AND SO. THE AGENCY THAT WOULD THAT WAS ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED WAS FOCUS ON THE VERY LOW INCOME YEAH. WE'VE BEEN AND AND EACH OF THE EXPANSION HAS BEEN TRYING. TO STRETCH IT TO PEOPLE WHO ARE -- WHO ARE STILL IN IN DIFFICULT FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES BUT COULD USE IT IS HOPE AND AND SO ARE? EXPANSION FOCUSES ON ON REALLY GIVING A MEANINGFUL HE IDC TO THOSE FAMILIES PLUS THE THE CREDIT FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR CREDIT FOR YOUNG CHILDREN. FAMILIES WITH YOUNG CHILDREN. IN THIS PETRIE-NORRIS. BACK TO A QUESTION ON THE ALEJO'S ANALYSIS SO I THINK YOU SAID -- THAT. YOU WOULD NOT ANTICIPATE FROM THE FOR THE PROPOSAL AS PRESENTED BY THE ADMINISTRATION THAT WOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON WORK FORCE PARTICIPATION. AND CAN YOU BRIEFLY TOUCH ON WAYS IN WHICH YOU THINK WE COULD STRUCTURE IT DIFFERENTLY THAT WORKFORCE PARTICIPATION YES -- THE ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL WE DESCRIBE ON STARTING ON PAGE NINE OF OUR REPORT. IN THAT. AS SHOWN IN FIGURE SIX ON PAGE TEN OF THE REPORT. IT WOULD BASICALLY INVOLVE -- INCREASING THE PEAK ABOUT IT WOULD KEEP THE EITC PERCENTAGE THE SAME IT WOULD IT WOULD. PEOPLE WOULD GET THOSE PERCENTAGES OVER A SLIGHTLY BIGGER RANGE OF INCOME AND SO THE NET IMPACT IS IT SAFE FOR SOMEBODY WHO IS -- SOUND ELEVEN THOUSAND OR TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS OF PRE TAX EARNINGS THEY WOULD GET A MUCH BIGGER BOOST TO THEIR E. I. T. C.. THEN THEY WOULD UNDER CURRENT LAW ARE UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. AND WE TEND TO FOCUS ON A LIKE THINGS LIKE ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR BECAUSE THAT'S ABOUT WHERE YOU'D BE IF YOU'RE WORKING ROUGHLY HALF TIME. AT THE MINIMUM WAGE IN THEM THE MINIMUM WAGE WE ACTUALLY SORT OF MISS IDENTIFIES BEING ELEVEN DOLLARS AN HOUR IT'S ONLY ELEVEN DOLLARS AN HOUR FOR PEOPLE WHO -- FOR EMPLOYERS WHO HAVE TWENTY FIVE OR FEWER WORKERS -- IT'S IT'S TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IT'S PART IN TWELVE DOLLARS AN HOUR FOR MOST PEOPLE BUT IT THAT DOESN'T. AFFECT NOW WITH OUR CONCLUSIONS MUCH IN. YES YOU CAN SORT OF SEE WHAT YOU'RE THE SORT OF ALTERNATIVE WOULD DO IT WITH PEOPLE IN THAT INCOME RANGE. I WAS ALSO I WAS KIND OF INTRIGUED BY YOUR POTENTIAL PROPOSAL THAT THE EXPANDED CHILD CARE TAX CREDIT COULD BE AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR CREDIT. IS THAT SOMETHING. THE ADMINISTRATION IS LOOKED AT AS WELL. YEAH I'M I THINK I THINK THE THE PROBLEM -- THE THE THE WEAKNESS WITHOUT PROPOSAL IS THAT IT THEM THE THERE THAT MONEY WOULD NOT GO TO TAXPAYERS TO USE HER USING INFORMAL CHILD CARE -- SO WOULD ONLY GO TO THOSE WHO GO THROUGH FORMAL AND SO WE THINK THAT WOULD LEAVE OUT OF A LARGE SWATH OF THE POPULATION. FOR THE L. L. LIKE HERE MORE IN YOUR VIEW OF THE CONFORMITY. SURE BRIAN WHETHER FORD WITH THE OF LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- WE HAD A HAND OUT THAT HAS A CAR FOR YOU. HOW WE -- SUGGEST CONSIDERING TAX CONFORMITY PROVISIONS. THE GENERAL CLOSER CONFORMITY BETWEEN THE STATE AND FEDERAL TAX LAWS IS BENEFICIAL BECAUSE IT MAKES TAX COMPLIANT SOMEWHAT EASIER -- MORE OVER -- CLOSER CONFORMITY -- BENEFITS THE STATE AND FILERS ALIKE -- BECAUSE THEY CAN RELY ON FEDERAL REGULATIONS AND FEDERAL JUDICIAL OPINIONS AND INTERPRETING TAX LAWS. AND RESOLVING TAX DISPUTES -- THAT SAID YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER THE MERITS OF EACH OF THE CONFORMITY PROVISIONS -- FOR PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR. INDIVIDUALLY -- LATER IN OUR HAND OUT AND ALSO ON ON PAGE FIVE OF THE AGENDA WE HAVE OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE GOVERNOR'S CONFORMITY PROPOSAL. WE FIND THAT THE FIRST FIVE ITEMS ON THE TABLE ARE GENERALLY REASONABLE AND THAT ON THE ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF CONFORMING. ARE STRONGER THAN THOSE AGAINST CONFORMING -- THESE ARE THE LIMITING NON CORPORATE BUSINESS LOSSES ELIMINATING THE KNOLL KERRY BACKS IT'S NOT OPERATING LOSSES. CHANGING THE LIKE KIND EXCHANGE RULES -- TO JUST ALLOW THAT PROVISION FOR REAL PROPERTY. EXCHANGES LIMITING DEDUCTION AND INCREASING THE FLEXIBILITY FOR SMALL BUSINESS ACCOUNTING RULES. SO -- I THINK THE THE ADMINISTRATION DESCRIBE THOSE BUT IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THOSE WERE HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT THAT -- THE END OF THIS -- THE SIX ITEM ON THIS LIST IS THE OPPORTUNITIES OWNS -- WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL -- AS A NEW TAX INCENTIVE PROGRAM -- AS ADMINISTRATION MENTIONED IT'S MODELED AFTER THE FEDERAL OPPORTUNITIES OWNS PROGRAM. THE THE FEDERAL INCENTIVE IS IS HIS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT AND SO -- OUR MAIN CONCERN IS JUST THAT -- THERE'S INVESTORS BENEFITING FROM THE PROPOSAL THE ADDITIONAL STATE BENEFIT MIGHT BE A WINDFALL TAX BENEFIT FOR THEM IF THEY WERE GOING TO MAKE THAT INVESTMENT ANYWAY -- HOWEVER WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE DESCRIBING -- THE DETAILS OF THAT PROPOSAL THAT AT THIS TIME -- THAT SAID THE GOVERNOR'S INDICATED THEY'D LIKE THE PROGRAM TO PROVIDE SOME INCENTIVE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN GREEN TECHNOLOGY. JOBS THE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THERE'S A VARIETY OF WAYS FOR THE STATE TO ENCOURAGE SUCH INVESTMENTS. AND IT'S NOT OBVIOUS TO US HOW -- OPPORTUNITIES OWNS WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN OTHER APPROACHES BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE LOOK FOR TO LEARNING MORE ABOUT -- THE REMAINING ITEMS ON THE LIST HAVE -- RELATIVELY SMALLER FISCAL EFFECTS AND MANY OF THEM WERE RECENTLY ADDED SO WE WE HAVEN'T REALLY DONE ON AN IN DEPTH ASSESSMENT OF THEM -- BUT FOR ALL THEY LOOK -- LIKE THEY WOULD MAKE MEANINGFUL IMPROVEMENTS THE SIMPLICITY THE STATE TAX CODE INNOCENTLY WORTHY OF CONSIDERATION -- IN CONCLUSION WE WANT TO CAUTION THAT THE FISCAL ESTIMATES PRESENTED HERE ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN. LARGELY BECAUSE THEY'RE BASED ON THE FEDERAL ESTIMATES TO VOTE BY THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON TAXATION AND THEN ADJUSTED FOR FOR CALIFORNIA IN ADDITION THERE'S GOING TO BE TAX PAYER -- CHANGES IN TAXPAYER BEHAVIORS THAT COULD -- LEAD TO A SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY ILLUSTRATING THIS THE THE FISCAL ESTIMATES AND AND OUR TABLE ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THAN THOSE PRESENTED ON BUT THE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND AND THAT HAS TO DO WITH -- SOME DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND HOW TAXPAYERS HOW THAT PROPOSALS WILL BE -- I I'VE I BELIEVE THAT JUST IT DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS THAT THEY GO INTO THOSE AND KIND OF ILLUSTRATES THAT IT'S HARD TO TARGET. A SPECIFIC DOLLAR AMOUNT -- ACCURATELY. AND SO WE SUGGEST THAT YOU CONSIDER THE ATC PROPOSAL INDEPENDENTLY FROM WHETHER OR NOT TO CONFORM TO ANY THE FEDERAL TAX CHANGES. OF BOTH DESERVE LEGISLATIVE DELIBERATION ON REGARDLESS OF THE REVENUE A FAX -- WE RELEASED A REPORT LAST. TWO THAT THAT ALSO ASSESSED A FIVE OTHER OF THE MAJOR CHANGES MADE IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN LAW AND WE CAN DISCUSS THOSE IF YOU'RE INTERESTED [inaudible] ISSUE. I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON ONE OF THE SPECIFIC CONFORMITY PROPOSAL ITEMS AROUND OPPORTUNITIES OWNS AS A CHAIR THE HOUSING COMMITTEE -- I REMEMBER A FEW WEEKS AGO -- WHEN GOVERNOR NEWSOME LAID OUT HIS BUDGET PROPOSAL YOU TALKED ABOUT COMBINING ENHANCE INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICTS ON TOP OPPORTUNITIES OWNS IS THAT WHAT THIS PROPOSALS ABOUT IN CAN YOU SEND US ANY MORE INFORMATION ABOUT? HOW YOU'RE PLANNING TO SPEND -- EIGHTY SO. THE I I DON'T I DON'T I THINK THEIR FEE A LOT OF THE ENHANCED IN V. I. G. I. IT'S EASIER YEAH EIFS. RIGHT HERE THE I. F. T. IS THIS AND SINCE THAT ARE. YEAH YOU HAVE TO USE -- ARE WOULD BECOME. A CO EXISTED WITH OPPORTUNITIES AND I THINK -- THE THERE WOULD THERE WOULD BE ANY SORT OF WELL I I REALLY CAN'T SPEAK TO HOW HOW THE COORDINATION WORK. I KNOW THAT THE OPPORTUNITY THE IDEA OF THE OPPORTUNITIES OWNS. WOULD BE TO PROVIDE. TAX BENEFITS. FOR INVESTMENT IN OPPORTUNITIES FOR INVESTMENT IN PROJECTS. THAT BENEFIT LOW INCOME HOUSING -- SO AT THAT THAT IS HOW THE OPPORTUNITY SO WE WOULD BE SEPARATE FROM WHATEVER THE III YEAH I F. T. IS DOING -- PROVIDING -- INCENTIVES FOR INVESTORS TO INVEST IN LOW INCOME HOUSING IN THE OPPORTUNITY SO. COULD WE GET SOME MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THIS ITEM I'LL JUST NOTE THE SIZE OF THIS ITEM IS THE SIZE OF THE CURRENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING TAX CREDIT SO IT'S A BIG TICKET ITEM. AND THERE'S ONLY TWO LINES OF DESCRIPTION ABOUT IT SO JUST LOVE TO LEARN MORE I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF LOT OF QUESTIONS. THROUGHOUT THIS MAN AND WHAT EXACTLY IS MEANT BY THIS IN AND WE ARE WE'RE WORKING OUT WITH THE OBVIOUSLY THE WHAT'S THE DEFINITION OF LOCALES WHO WERE WORKING ON THAT -- AS WELLS DEFINITION OF GREEN TECHNOLOGY -- SO WE'RE WORKING ON THOSE THINGS THEY HOPE TO HAVE SOME TEA SOON COME BUT I THINK OF I THINK THE MODEL WE MAY BE LOOKING AT WOULD BE LOOKING FOR THE LOW INCOME HOUSING. IS THAT IT WOULD -- MATCH WHAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX WOULD HAVE THE SAME SORT OF STRUCTURE IN PLACE THEREFORE VERIFYING THAT THE THAT THE MONEY IF IT IF IT'S QUICK LOOKING FOR TO GIVEN IT'S SUCH A HUGE POTENTIAL CHANGE IN ITS. WITH VERY LITTLE INFORMATION AND I DO KNOW THE GOVERNOR PLIGHT I UNDERSTOOD THE GOVERNOR WAS GOING TO PUT OUT A PROPOSAL AROUND THE INTERSECTION OF THE I. FDA'S WITH OPPORTUNITY SOUNDS AND YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE NOT. SURE IF THIS IS IT. YEAH I'D BE SOMETHING ELSE YEAH I'M I'M I'M ACTUALLY NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE HOUSE OKAY SO IF WE COULD GET A BRIEFING ON THAT THAT CERTAINLY. AND AND JUST -- TO CLARIFY THAT REVENUE ESTIMATE. IS -- IT HAS NOT BEEN PROPERLY SCALED DOWN SO PRESUMABLY THE REVENUES GOOD THIS WAS A REVENUE FOR FULL CONFORMITY WITHOUT. ANY -- WITHOUT ANY LIMITATIONS OFF FOR LOW INCOME HOUSING OR CLEAN TECHNOLOGY THAT SORT OF THING. SO THE REVENUE WOULD ACTUALLY BE LOWER THAN THIS. ONCE WE PUT IN THOSE LIMITATIONS WHICH HAPPENED HAVEN'T DONE THOSE LIMITATIONS. THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MR TING. THANK YOU MISTER -- JUST TO ASK LA AS SO JUST REGARDING THEIR REVENUE PROJECTIONS ON THE TASK OF FORMALLY PACKAGE DID YOU AGREE WITH THE ASSESSMENT. OF PERHAPS ONE POINT FOUR MILLION MOBILE FOR BILLY EXCUSE ME I'M GOING. OVERALL IT'S IN THE RIGHT ORDER OF MAGNITUDE BUT IT. THE THE LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTIES IN THE TENS TO POSSIBLY LE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS DEPENDING ON THE WAY TAXPAYERS TO CHANGE THEIR BE THE EXISTING FEDERAL THE THE TEXTURES OF RT CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND WE DON'T KNOW. EXACTLY HOW YET THE THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD DOESN'T KNOW HOW YET WE WON'T RECEIVE. MORE INFORMATION ON TAXPAYER TAX FILER BEHAVIOR FOR THE EFFECTIVE TAX YEAR TWENTY EIGHTEEN FOR A MANY MONTHS. AND AND SO IT'S IT'S DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE AT THIS POINT WHAT WHAT OUR STATE CONFORMITY. TO THOSE PROVISIONS FOLLOWING THE FEDERAL CHANGES WILL BE -- THE THIS THIS LOOKS LIKE IT'S IN THE GENERAL ORDER OF MAGNITUDE. SO SO FOR YOUR ANALYSIS YOU JUST ACCEPTED FINANCES ASSUMPTIONS YOU DIDN'T. READ IT'S BASED ON THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD THE FTV IS AS FTP DID BOTH THE IN OFFICE FOR ABOUT OKAY. THANK YOU. AND THEN -- JUST REGARDING E. I. T. C. FOR SECOND YOU HAD MENTIONED OUTSIDE OF THE PROPOSAL. AROUND THE THE TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR MARK DID YOU HAVE OTHER EVEN TO MENTIONED IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT -- OTHER IDEAS THAT YOU THOUGHT WOULD MORE TARGET SPECIFIC POPULATIONS [inaudible] YEAH -- WE INCLUDE IN THE IT TOWARD THE BACK OF THE REPORT THE PROPOSAL THAT -- I WAS MENTIONING EARLIER TO EXT YEAH EXTEND THE THE PHASE IN RANGE OF THE THE CREDIT SO THAT YOU HAVE YEAH BASICALLY YOU GET JUST GIVE A BIGGER CREDITS FOR A LOT OF ENTER YOUR THAT WITH THE GRAPH WHICH IS MAKES IT EASY TO UNDERSTAND HIS. OR EASIER TO UNDERSTAND IS ON PAGE. TEN AND SO THAT REALLY KIND OF IT. SORT OF VISUALLY DESCRIBES WHAT IT DOES -- FOR THAT'S FOR A HOUSEHOLD WITH TWO DEPENDENTS FOR A HOUSEHOLD WITH ONE DEPENDENT. IT WOULD. THE GRAPH ITSELF WOULD LOOK THE SAME BUT IT WOULD BE SHE WOULD BE SCALED DOWN SO IT WOULD BECOME AT A LOWER. INCOME RANGE -- FOR THREE DEPENDENTS IT'S ROUGHLY THE SAME AS WITH TWO DEPENDENTS IS THERE A LOWER COST OR HIGHER COST WE TRIED TO SET THIS UP SO THE COST OF THAT PROPOSAL WOULD BE SIMILAR TO WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING. NOW ONE THING OUR PROPOSAL DOES NOT INCLUDE IS IT IT DOESN'T HAVE THE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR P. FOR HOUSEHOLDS WITH AT LEAST ONE KID UNDER THE AGE OF SIX SO BASICALLY WE TOOK THAT WHOLE. ROUGHLY SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN SEE HOW FAR IT UP WE COULD PUSH. THE THE THE MAXIMUM EITC AMOUNT AND SO IS IS IT AS IT TURNED OUT. WE THINK THAT YOU COULD INCREASE THE AMOUNTS BY 42% FOR ALL TYPES OF FILERS. AND THAT WOULD A NO COST ROUGHLY SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. IN AND SO THE AYE THE IDEA IS TO TRY TO GET. WELL TO AN INCOME LEVEL OF ROUGHLY. TWENTY THOUSAND WHO WHAT WHERE ARE YOU TRYING TO BECAUSE THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF VIEW IDC'S TRY TO GET THEM TO A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF INCOME. WELL IT THE WHOLE I GUESS THE IT HAS THEIR DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES AT THE A. T. C. HAS AND SO. THE THE OBJECTIVE OF A PROPOSAL LIKE THIS WOULD BE -- TO TRY TO DRAW MORE PEOPLE INTO THE WORK FORCE AND TO PROVIDE BIGGER BOOST FOR PEOPLE SORT OF IN THE TEN TO TWENTY TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLAR INCOME RANGER MAY BE SLIGHTLY LOWER IF THEY ONLY HAVE ONE DEPENDENT. AND YOU'RE SAYING THAT THAT BOTH PROPOSALS DUE THAT FORMS ARE JUST -- THE VOTE THEIR ALTERNATIVE THAT WE DESCRIBE WOULD HAVE MORE OF AN IMPACT ON THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD YOU KNOW. TARGET BENEFITS FOR FIRST OF ALL THE PEOPLE WITH KIDS UNDER AGE SIX WOULD EACH GET THAT FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND SECOND. PEOPLE GENERALLY BETWEEN -- SAY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OF INCOME WOULD TYPICALLY SEE THE BIGGEST INCREASES. IN AND WHY WHY WOULD -- WHY DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD DROP PEOPLE INTO THE WORKFORCE BECAUSE IT PROVIDES A BIGGER -- A BIGGER SORT OF AFTER TAX INCOME -- WAGE SUBSIDY TO PEOPLE -- WORKING ABOUT WORKING HALF TIME IN PARTICULAR. DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE THAT THAT WOULD BE AN INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE TO COME IN. YEAH THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE I. T. C. -- DOES SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE WORKFORCE PARTICIPATION ESPECIALLY AMONG -- AMONG -- SINGLE MOTHERS. GREAT THANK YOU. NO QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MY GOD OPEN UP PUBLIC COMMENT. THE OCEAN IS BIG ON THE SIDE. HELLO GOOD AFTERNOON TERROR COOPER AND HER BURKE -- MY NAME'S NAY AT LEAST ON THE WILD WITH UNITED WAY SO CALIFORNIA -- UNITED WAY FIGHTS FOR OR THE HEALTH EDUCATION AND FINANCIAL STABILITY OF EVERY PERSON IN EVERY COMMUNITY.

AND ALSO TO CONTINUE INCREASE MULTI YEAR FUNDING FOR OUR REGION FREE TAX PREP THANK YOU. HELLO EVERYONE MY NAME IS SASHA FELT SEEN I'M WITH THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER AND AS PART OF THAT CALLIE ATC COALITION I'M HERE TO SUPPORT KELLY ATC. AND TO STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO REMOVE HARMFUL EXCLUSIONS FOR IMMIGRANT TAX FILERS. OUT WE SUPPORT AND APPLAUD GOVERNOR MUSINGS PROPOSAL TO EXPAND AND STRENGTHEN CALLIE ATC AND WE SUPPORT EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT AN EXPANSION IS ADEQUATELY FUNDED. HOWEVER WE ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT THESE CONVERSATIONS TO DATE HAVE NOT HAVE CONTINUED TO EXCLUDE IMMIGRANT FAMILIES. THE HTC HAS DONE MORE THAN ANY OTHER PROGRAM TO LIFT FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY. IT'S BEEN SHOWN TO PROMOTE EDUCATIONAL SUCCESS WHOSE LOCAL ECONOMIC GROWTH AND MOST IMPORTANT IMPROVE CHILD AND MATERNAL HEALTH. HOWEVER EVEN THOUGH IMMIGRANTS CONTRIBUTE A THIRD OF CALIFORNIANS GDP AND ARE VITAL TO OUR ECONOMY THOUSANDS OF LOW INCOME WORKING IMMIGRANT FAMILIES ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS TAX CREDIT. INCLUDING AYE TEN FILERS AND THOSE WITH DOC AND HE PS WHO LOSE THEIR IMMIGRATION RELIEF BY THE WAY. THIS EXCLUSION NEGATIVELY IMPACTS ADULTS AND CHILDREN ALIKE AS MANY IMMIGRANTS LIVING MAKE STATUS HOUSEHOLDS WERE US CITIZEN CHILDREN ARE UNABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THE CAL ATC BECAUSE OF THEIR PARENTS IMMIGRATION STATUS. SOME OF OUR PARTNER SO WE'VE SPOKEN WITH ON THE GROUND DEEPLY UNDERSTAND HOW EVEN A MODEST TAX CREDIT GOOD SOMETIMES MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PAYING FOR BASIC NEEDS SUCH AS MEDICAL EXPENSES RENT. BEING ABLE TO SAVE FOR RETIREMENT ARE NOT BEING ABLE TO DO SO. I ALSO WANT TO MENTION REGARDING THE FEES OF YEAR IT MADE IT PRETTY FAR ALONG IN THE BUDGET PROCESS -- WE ALSO WORKED ON EXPANDING THE CREDIT FOR SELF EMPLOYED INDIVIDUALS AND WE WERE ABLE TO FIT FIGURE THAT OUT SO I THINK WE CAN FIGURE OUT THIS -- TO WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO INCLUDE ALL AND MAKE. INCOME ELIGIBLE TAX FILERS IN THE CAL YET YOU SEE TO ENSURE THAT OUR STATE'S INVESTMENTS IN FIGHTING POVERTY WORK TO FIGHT POVERTY FOR EVERY CALIFORNIAN AND THAT OUR ECONOMY TRULY WORKS FOR ALL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HELLO THANK YOU TEAR COOPER IN CHAIR BURKE MY NAME IS TERRY OLEY I'M WITH THE ECONOMIC SECURITY PROJECT ACTION. ROUTE ORGANIZATION FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING INEQUALITY POVERTY IN AFFORDABILITY AND WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED ON USING THE MOST EFFECTIVE TOOLS WE HAVE AND THAT'S THE EITC SO I THINK YOU FOR SO MUCH ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE AND ALL OF THAT THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSION THAT WE'VE HAD ALREADY TODAY. WE APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR'S COST OF LIVING REFUND PROPOSAL IS A GREAT FIRST STEP AT REALIZING THE PROMISE OF THIS PROGRAM TO ADDRESS -- THE NEEDS OF SO MANY PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. I PARTICULARLY WANT TO CALL OUT THE GOVERNOR'S CALL TO DISPERSE THE REFUND AND MONTHLY PAYMENTS I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION THAT WAS HAD HERE. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY FOR CLARIFICATION THAT -- THERE IS ANOTHER WAY I AGREE THAT IS IN THE BEST CASE SCENARIO A REAL TIME IT DISBURSEMENT OF WHICH WOULD REQUIRE KIND OF PREDICTING EARNINGS ACROSS THE YEAR. COULD BE COMPLICATED BECAUSE OF THE WAY WE STRUCTURE THE ATC IN CALIFORNIA BUT I WOULD URGE -- ALL THIS TO EXPLORE OPPORTUNITIES TO CREATE A DEFERRED PAYMENT WHICH OR COMBO WHERE IF THERE'S A FLAT LIKE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR CREDIT TO HOUSE SO YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO GET BECAUSE OF HAVING A YOUNG CHILD. GREAT THAT CAN BE DONE AHEAD OF TIME BUT YOU COULD MONTHLY PAYMENT OF LAST YEAR'S TAX EARNINGS IN THIS YEAR WHICH STILL HAS THE EFFECT OF BLUNTING SOME OF THE VOLATILITY. ADD THAT MANY LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS EXPERIENCE SO I'D URGE PEOPLE TO EXPLORE THAT -- AS WELL I WOULD LIKE TO CALL ATTENTION TO SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED HERE TODAY AND REALLY URGE -- YOU ALL TO CONSIDER THEM AND EXPLORE THEM FOR THIS YEAR -- THE FIRST AYE ONE ECHO MY COLLEAGUES AROUND INCLUDING AYE TENS I THINK THIS IS JUST ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL AND I'LL JUST. INCORPORATE WHAT THEY SAID AS MY OWN COMMENTS AS WELL -- SECOND IN ADDITION TO MODERNIZING THIS PROGRAM WITH MONTHLY PAYMENTS -- I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE US MODERNIZE WITH AN AUTO FILING -- OPPORTUNITY ERIN OUT OF FILING PROGRAM. THINKING ABOUT AFFECTED BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS THIS WOULD BE PROVIDING A REALLY POWERFUL KNOWLEDGE TO PEOPLE WHO-- AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO MENTION OFTENDON'T FILE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO AND REACHING OUT TO THEM WITH INFORMATION THAT WE ALREADY HAVE LET'S USE THIS DATA TO OUR ADVANTAGE. IT REALLY WOULD BRING MORE PEOPLE INTO THE PROGRAM. AND I WOULD LOVE TO SEE US LOOK AT READY RETURN AS A AS A MODEL -- FINALLY I AGREE WITH -- COMMENTS THAT MADE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER WEEKS AND SHE KING ISING THE IMPORTANT BUT UNPAID CARE GIVING THAT HAPPENS IN CALIFORNIA. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- TO PROVIDE A FIVE DOLLAR CREDIT GETS AS PART WAY THERE OF RECOGNIZING CARE GIVERS AND I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE US A LOOK AT EXTENDING THAT OUT TO CARE GIVING FOR ADULT DEPENDENCE LIKE ELDERLY AND ADULTS WITH DISABILITIES. AND THINKING ABOUT INCREASING THAT SO THAT WE REALLY ARE I'M CALLING ATTENTION TO THE UNDER RECOGNIZE BUT VERY -- HARD WORK OF CARE GIVING IN THE STATE THANK YOU. WHEN YOU? CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TERRY BRANHAM HALF OF S. YEAH YOU CALIFORNIA -- I FIRST TAKE I JUST WANT TO SAY WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY HERE IN CALIFORNIA A LEAD THE NATION. IN A PROGRESSIVE RESPONSE TO WHAT HAPPENED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WE HAD A HUGE TAX BREAK TO THE WEALTHIEST INDIVIDUALS IN THE NATION. AND THIS PROPOSAL TAKES A SMALL PORTION OF THAT. THROUGH CONFORMITY AND PAYS FOR A BENEFIT FOR WORKERS WHO GOT NOTHING. OUT OF THE FEDERAL TAX BREAK A COST PENNIES ON THE DYING TO DO THIS AND WE ENCOURAGE YOU. TO WORK FORWARD WITH A CLEARLY IT'S GOT SOME ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED THE I TEN ISSUE THE AUTOMATED TO ROMAN. I WOULD ALSO CAUTION YOU LOOK VERY AT THE OPPORTUNITIES OPPORTUNITIES OWN PROPOSAL WHICH HAS THE POTENTIAL TO EAT UP ALL THE REVENUE YOU USING TO PROVIDE THEIR SUPPORT NOT CAREFUL IF WE DON'T FENCE IT PROPERLY.

AND LASTLY I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEES IN THE MEMBERS TO HAVE AN OPEN MIND ON THE ISSUES RELATED CONFORMITY -- WHEN WE SUFFERED THE BIG BUDGET CUTS BACK A TEN YEARS AGO? SAFETY NET PROGRAMS WERE THE FIRST ONES TO GET HIT. AND NOW IN THE MEANTIME AND SINCE THAT TIME RATED A CHILD POVERTY SUB ACCOUNT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE FUNDS GOING INTO THE TOWERS PROGRAM. LAST YEAR WE WERE ABLE TO CREATE A SAFETY NET RESERVE FOR A CAL WORKS IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM THESE ARE SMART IDEAS THIS MEANS THAT WE HAVE REVENUE FLOWING INTO THESE PROGRAMS THIS MEANS. THAT IN A DOWNTURN YEAR WE HAVE MONEY WE CAN LEAN BACK ON TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LOWER THE POOREST PEOPLE OUR STATE DON'T TAKE THE BRUNT OF A BAD BUDGET YEAR. SO THESE ARE GOOD REASONS WHY WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT DOING CONFORMITY IN ADDITION TO THESE GREAT IDEAS AROUND THE TAX CREDITS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU.
