DRAFT REPORT. THE COMMISSION WAS CREATED BY SB NINE A ONE STATUTES OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE COMMISSION'S CHARGE WAS TO EXAMINE ISSUES RELATED TO CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. ASSOCIATED WITH UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE. SB NINE A ONE FOR THE REQUIRED THAT THE COMMISSION PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH OPTIONS FOR THE SOCIALIZATION OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. IN OPTIONS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A FUND. TO ASSIST IN THE PAYMENT OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. THE COMMISSION IS HELD THE REQUISITE FOR HEARINGS AND RELEASES DRAFT REPORT WITH RECOMMENDATIONS. JUST ABOUT TEN DAYS AGO. JUST LAST FRIDAY THE COMMISSION HELD ITS FINAL HEARING IT ADOPTED REPORT. WITH A FEW MODIFICATIONS I UNDERSTAND THE FINAL REPORT WILL BE FORTHCOMING SHORTLY -- I MIGHT ADD AHEAD OF THE STATUTORY DEADLINE SO THANKS FOR THE HARD WORK FOR THE THIS COMMISSION IS A LOT OF WORK PUT IN. AND I GET ADDITIONAL REQUESTED -- WHEN? OUR SPEAKERS TO COME UP -- PROBABLY THE SPEARMEN TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN -- YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAD BEFORE AND WHAT YOU LEARNED. AND MODIFICATIONS THAT WERE DONE AT YOUR MOST RECENT MEETING. TODAY -- WE HAVE THREE PANELS. PANEL ONE WILL BE CARLA DETERMINE WHO JOINS US AGAIN AS THE GOVERNOR'S APPOINTEE THE COMMISSION CHAIR. TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE ENTIRE DRAFT REPORT. THE SPEARMAN WILL BE FOLLOWED BY THE AUDIBLE RICARDO LARA COMMISSIONER OF INSURANCE WHO GIVE US PERSPECTIVES ON INSURANCE ISSUES. THAT ARE ADDRESSED THROUGHOUT THE REPORT. FINALLY PROFESSOR WHAT MICHAEL WAR OF THE SENATE'S COMMISSION APPOINTEE WILL REVIEW THAT PART OF THE REPORT PERTAINING TO COST RECOVERY ISSUES. IN A WILD FIRES VICTIMS A WILDFIRE VICTIMS BUT BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION TO THE SPEARMEN. PROFESSOR WAR AND BY EXTENSION THE OTHER THREE COMMISSIONERS. IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH FOR THE INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF HARD WORK THEY'VE CONTRIBUTED IN PREPARING IN PRODUCING THE REPORT WE HAVE BEFORE US I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL VERY. VERY MUCH WOULD ANY OF THE OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBER -- MEMBERS -- LIKE SAY A FEW WORDS BEFORE WE BEGIN THE FIRST -- PRESENTATION SEEING NONE -- MISTREATMENT PLEASE COME FORWARD AND AND WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON. SENATOR DODD AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME BACK TO SPEAK WITH YOU AGAIN AND TO UPDATE YOU ON THE PROGRESS THAT THE NINE OH ONE COMMISSION HAS MADE SINCE WE LAST CONVENE. I THINK SENATOR DODD FOR GIVING MORE MORE OF THE BACKGROUND ON THE STATUS OF WHERE WE ARE. I WON'T REPEAT THE PROCESS INFORMATION THAT I SHARED WITH YOU AT THE LAST MEETING. I'LL JUST HIGHLIGHT THAT. AS A SENATOR NOTED WE DID ADOPT THE FINAL REPORT ON FRIDAY. I WOULD SAY THAT THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE ADOPTED WERE VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WAS IN THE DRAFT REPORT. AFTER DISCUSSION AMONG THE COMMISSIONERS WE DID ADD SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INTO THOSE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ARE REGARDING CHALLENGES AS WELL AS SOME OF THE DIFFERENT LEGAL INTERPRETATIONS AND APPROACHES ONE MIGHT TAKE -- BUT FOR THE MOST PART THEY REMAINED THE SAME AND WE CAN GO INTO SPECIFICS LATER. SO I WAS ASKED JUST TO GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF THE COMMISSION'S REPORT NOW THAT IT IS PUBLIC. AND I APPRECIATE THAT. MOST OF YOU HAVE ALREADY READ THE REPORT AND IS A LOT IN THERE SO I WON'T GO LINE BY LINE. GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR BUT I DID WANT TO AT A HIGH LEVEL TOUCH UPON OUR FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. SO AT A HIGH LEVEL WE FOUND THAT UTILITY COSTS FIRES HAVE BEEN SOME OF THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE FIRES IN THE SUCH UTILITIES MUST TAKE A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN MITIGATING RISK. WE ALSO FOUND HOWEVER THAT WILD FIRE RISK IS CREATED BY MULTIPLE PARTIES WHO SHOULD ALL BE INCENTIVIZE TO REDUCE RISK. AND SHARING PAYING FOR SOME OF THE WILDFIRE DAMAGE. AND THAT ALSO INCREASED TEMPERATURES AN INCREASE POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA. HAS EXASPERATED THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE WERE SEEN FROM THESE FIRES. THE ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THE COSTS AND DAMAGES ASSOCIATE WITH WILDFIRES ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD IN HARD TO PREDICT. THE LAST TWO YEARS COULD HAVE BEEN AND WANTED TWENTY YEAR EXPERIENCE OR A ONE A TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEAR EXPERIENCE. WHICH MEANS THAT WE NEED TO BE PREPARING FOR A RANGE OF POTENTIAL RISK SCENARIOS ESPECIALLY AS WE SEE HOW IMPACTFUL THE STATE'S WILD FIRE MITIGATION EFFORTS ARE. AS A WILDFIRE LIABILITIES INCREASE WE FIND THAT UTILITY INSURANCE HAS HISTORICALLY THAT HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN AVAILABLE TO COVER WILDFIRE COST. IS NOT AVAILABLE AT THE LEVELS NECESSARY THERE ARE VERY FEW INSURERS IN THE MARKET IN PREMIUMS HAVE INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY THESE ARE PREMIUMS THAT ARE PAID BY ELECTRICITY CUSTOMERS. WE ALSO FOUND THAT THE HOME INSURANCE MARKET IS BECOMING MORE DIFFICULT AND MORE EXPENSIVE TO OBTAIN HOME INSURANCE AND HIGH WILD. AREAS AND THAT EVEN WILD FIRE VICTIMS WITH INSURANCE POLICIES FACE CHALLENGES INCLUDING HIGHER REBUILDING COST AND NON RENEWALS. WE HAVE SEVERAL FINDINGS THAT REINFORCE THAT GIVEN THE GREATER RISK FOR BIGGER FIRES THE STATUS QUO IS NOT SUSTAINABLE FOR VICTIMS. CALIFORNIANS LIVING IN THE FIRE AREAS UTILITIES ELECTRIC CUSTOMERS. FULLER WE FIND THAT THE LIABILITY FRAMEWORK THAT ASSIGNS COSTS TO UTILITIES REGARDLESS OF FAULT. LESS SPECIFIC STANDARDS FOR UTILITY COST RECOVERY FOR FIRES. AND INSURANCE POLICIES THAT DO NOT FULLY ADDRESS WILDFIRE DAMAGE OR INCORPORATE WILD FIRE RISK PREVENTION. COLLECTIVELY RESULT IN UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE COVERAGE OF COST AND SETTLEMENT OF WILDFIRE CLAIMS. IT'S ALSO PRESENTS A GREATER INVESTMENT RISK AND RISK OF BANKRUPTCY FOR CALIFORNIA TO LADIES. AND ALSO CAN LEAD TO HIGHER COSTS FOR ELECTRIC CUSTOMERS WHO ALREADY SEEING RISING RATES. THE COMBINATION OF THESE FACTORS IN CALIFORNIA UTILITIES ACROSS THE STATE AND IT'S ALL UTILITIES ACROSS THE STATE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE. RESULT IN OUR UTILITIES BEING PERCEIVED AS HIGHER RISK. MAKING UTILITY FINANCING AND INVESTMENTS MORE EXPENSIVE AND WEAKENING THE ABILITY OF UTILITIES TO PROVIDE CLEAN RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE ELECTRIC SERVICES. SO HERE ARE KEY RECOMMENDATIONS. WE PLACE THE CURRENT STRICT LIABILITY INTERPRETATION OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION WITH THE FALL BASED STANDARD. MAKE CHANGES TO THE STANDARD FOR INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY COST RECOVERY FOR WILDFIRE COST. THAT ACKNOWLEDGE THE NASCENT UNDERSTANDING OF PRUDENT ACTION FOR WILDFIRE REDUCTION AND BETTER ACCOUNT FOR SOME OF THESE EXHAUSTION IS FACTORS THAT CAN LEAD TO MORE DAMAGE LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE. IN PARTICULAR REGARDING COST RECOVERY WE RECOMMEND ADOPTING THE FOR BURDEN OF PROOF STANDARD FOR COST RECOVERY. REFINEMENT OF THOSE SB NINE A ONE FACTORS THAT THE C. P. U. C. SHOULD CONSIDER AND ASSESSING DISALLOWANCE IS. AND A CAP ON MAXIMUM UTILITY INVESTOR LIABILITY SOMETHING LIKE A STRESS TEST. IF YOU TO THE SHAREHOLDERS HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY CONTRIBUTED TO WILD TO A WILDFIRE FIND. WE ALSO RECOMMEND THE CREATION OF A WILD FIRE VICTIMS CLAIMS PAYING FUND THAT IS BROADLY SOURCED. INCLUDING FUNDING BY SHAREHOLDERS RATE PAYERS AND HOMEOWNERS. UTILITY SHAREHOLDERS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO REPAY BACK THE FUN A SPECIFIED AMOUNT IF FOUND TO BE IMPRUDENT. WE ALSO RECOMMEND OTHER ACTIONS TO ENSURE UTILITY ACCOUNTABILITY INCLUDING GREATER FIND AUTHORITY. WE ALSO MAKE A SERIES OF REFORMS RECOMMENDATIONS OF A HOMEOWNER INSURANCE MARKET TO MAINTAIN AVAILABLE AND AFFORDABLE INSURANCE. INCLUDING MAINTAINING CALIFORNIA'S RISK BASED PRICING OF INSURANCE -- AS ONE OF THOSE -- KEY RECOMMENDATIONS AND THEN FINALLY WE OFFER SOME RECOMMENDATIONS ON MITIGATING FIRE RISK AND BETTER STREAMLINING RISK INVESTMENT. SPECIFICALLY THE REPORT RECOMMENDS THAT WE ADDRESS THE DECENTRALIZED -- INCONSISTENT WAY IN WHICH WE INVEST IN REGULATE WILDFIRE MITIGATION. BY CREATING AN ELECTRIC UTILITY WILDFIRE BOARD OR ANOTHER VEHICLE TO GOVERN UTILITY WILDFIRE PREVENTION. WE ALSO RECOMMEND TAKING ACTIONS TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE CONSISTENCY OF PRIVATE PROPERTY MAINTENANCE LAWS AND FIREFIGHTING SERVICES AVAILABLE TO PROPERTIES. AND AS I NOTED BEGINNING ON FRIDAY WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME DISCUSSING THE FACT THAT EACH OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS HAS POTENTIAL LEGAL AND IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES. AND THE REPORT EXPANDS UPON US SOME OF THOSE BUT I JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THOSE FOR YOU TODAY. FOR EXAMPLE A STRICT LIABILITY THEIR DIFFERENCES A LEGAL OPINION REGARDING HOW EXACTLY THE LEGISLATURE CAN ENACT CHANGES. AND WHAT CONSEQUENCES OF ANY THERE WOULD BE TO THE HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE MARKET WITH THAT DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION. REGARDING COSTS RECOVERING IT IS A CHALLENGE TO ENSURE THAT THE CPUC STILL HAS THE AUTHORITY AND DISCRETION TO DECIDE REASONABLE RATES AND THAT ELECTRIC CUSTOMERS AREN'T UNDULY ON THE HOOK FOR WILDFIRE. ACOSTA THERE'S UTILITIES MISMANAGEMENT WHILE PROVIDING SOME MORE CERTAINTY TO UTILITY INVESTORS REGARDING HOW THESE COSTS CLAIMS WILL BE EVALUATED AND CONSIDERED. AND THEN REGARDING A FIND. THE REPORT GOES INTO A LOT OF DETAIL ABOUT SOME OF THE POTENTIAL CHALLENGES HERE BUT THAT INCLUDE NOT PERVERSELY. INCENTIVIZE THE RISKY BEHAVIOR WE STILL WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT HOMEOWNERS GET HOME INSURANCE. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES AS WELL AS IF YOU WANT A SHAREHOLDER CONTRIBUTION HOW IS THAT CONTRIBUTION GOTTEN STRUCTURED FROM A UTILITY LIKE P. JEANNIE -- THAT'S GOING THROUGH THE BANKRUPTCY PROCESS. THEN ALSO ONE KEY COMPONENT OF A FINE IS MAINTAINING SETTLEMENT VALUE LEVELS A SIMILAR TO WHAT'S HAPPENED DOWN IN SOME OF THE FIRES TO DATE BETWEEN THE SETTLEMENTS TING INSURANCE COMPANIES IN THE UTILITIES. HOW DO YOU MAINTAIN THE SUBROGATION LETTERS LEVELS AND PUT THAT INTO LEGISLATION? THE KNOWLEDGE THAT IF YOU DON'T ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES THE SIZE OF A FIND HOW BIG WOULD NEED TO BE COULD BE BIGGER AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE STEPS TO BE DONE -- AS YOU THINK ABOUT THIS AND LEGISLATION. I'M SICK ALL THE CHALLENGES WE DID NOT GET CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE REGARDING HOW YOU WOULD. DEAL WITH THEM AND LEGISLATE THEM I THINK THERE ARE SOME GOOD IDEAS OUT THERE. BUT WE WANTED TO MAKE YOU AWARE OF THE CHALLENGES BUT AS A BODY WE THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO TRANSMIT TO YOU. AS A BROADER SET OF POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE THOUGHT WOULD BE WORTH WHILE YOU'RE AT REVIEW A CONSIDERATION. SO WITH THAT THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS [inaudible] QUESTIONS. THAT ARE HILL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THE COMMISSION PETER AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND FOR YOUR HARD WORK AND A YEAR. THE TREMENDOUS DEDICATED PUBLIC SERVANT AND THANK YOU FOR THAT. I AM CURIOUS ABOUT THE ELECTRIC UTILITY WILDFIRE BOARD AND AS IT WAS -- POSED IN THE IN THE REPORT IT'S NOT REALLY SETS OUT RULES AND REGULATIONS AND PROCEDURES FOR ALL UTILITIES COULD MANDATE RATE YOU KNOW THERE'S A WHOLE LIST OF THINGS THAT IT CAN DO DEVELOP IN OUR A. D. HAVE FINE AND PENALTY IS -- FORTY BUT ASIDE FROM THE INCLUSION OF THE FUEL USED IN THE AT THE E. U. W.. BOARD HOW DOES THIS BOARD DIFFER FROM THE CURRENT CHIEF UC. OPERATIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES. WE HAD A GOOD DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS ON FRIDAY AND THE AUTHORS OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS REALLY HIGHLIGHTED THAT THEY BROUGHT THIS IDEA OF A VEHICLE FORD BECAUSE OF THE NEED TO FOCUS ON THESE ISSUES. THAT THERE ARE THESE EFFORTS AS YOU NOTED HAPPENING AT THE P. YOU SEE AND ARE ALSO HAPPENING AT EACH PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITY. BUT GIVEN THE URGENCY OF THE ISSUE IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE TO HAVE A NEW STANDING BODY THAT IS CONCENTRATED ON THESE TOPICS -- IN TERMS OF THE DIFFERENCE FROM THE P. YOU SEE AGAIN I THINK IT COMES DOWN TO A MATTER OF RESOURCES AS MUCH AS ANYTHING -- IF YOU STATUS IN NEW BOARD THERE WOULD OF COURSE BE ATTENTION TO WHAT RESOURCES WOULD BE NEEDED. THOSE ARE ALSO RESOURCES THAT COULD BE DEPLOYED AT THE P. YOU SEE AS WELL TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE SAME CONCERNS. BUT I THINK WE FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO RAISE THIS ISSUE FOR YOU AND TO THINK ABOUT HOW DO YOU ELEVATE IT EITHER WITH AN AGENCY OR WITH A NEW BODY. WAS THERE ANY TALK. WAS THERE ANY DISCUSSION AS TO HOW YOU WOULD DEAL WITH SOME OF THE IF THERE'S SOME BUT YOU DO PRETORIA RULINGS THAT WOULD COME FROM THAT AN APPEAL PROCESS OR AND HOW THAT WOULD. A WITH THE NEW BOARD HOW WITH TO PROCESS BE ADMINISTERED IN THERE TO GET INTO THE DETAILS OF THAT MUCH SURE IT DID NOT GET INTO THOSE DETAILS ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE DID DISCUSS THOUGH WAS. MAKING SURE WE DON'T HAVE. TWO DIFFERENT REGULATORS THEY'LL BE OPINING ON THE SAME ISSUE AND WE APPRECIATE THAT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION -- IS BY THE CONSTITUTION THE ECONOMIC REGULATOR FOR THE I. O. U.'S AND SO IF YOU WERE TO HAVE A SEPARATE BOARD. YOU WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE WHATEVER DECISIONS THAT THEY'VE PASSED OUR OUR BINDING -- IMPROPERLY FLOW THROUGH THE P. YOU SEE BUT I WOULD SAY THAT IS A CHALLENGE. ANOTHER ISSUE THAT I REASON OUR DISCUSSION WAS AT THE P. YOU SEE DOES OVERALL SAFETY OVERSIGHT FOR THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES AND THERE AR SEVERAL OTHER PROCESSES IN PLACE ARE RELATED TO WILDFIRES. SEED ONE ALL OF THESE TO BE COORDINATED AND HARMONIZED THIS INCLUDES THE ONE ONE NEW NEW BOARD END OF HOW WOULD THE NEW BOARD -- YOU KNOW THERE'S STREAMLINING. PROCESS SEASON AND PROCEDURAL DESIGNATIONS IN THIS THE GOVERNOR SHRIKE FORCE THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE STREAMLINING EFFORT -- DO YOU SEE THAT THIS COULD. OF THE CREATION THE NEW NEW BOARD COULD ACCOMPLISH THAT OR IS IT JUST MERELY TRANSFERRING THOSE SAME IMBEDDED PROBLEMS AT THE CPUC HAS TO THE NEW BOARD THAT -- AND THE NEW STRUCTURE IT IS A BEEN ANY DISCUSSION AS TO HOW THAT WOULD. WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED A COULD BE. IT WAS NOT -- IN EFFECT THE RESEARCHER THANK YOU -- ONE OF THE COST RECOVERY OPTIONS PRESENTED IN THE IN THE WELL IN YOU'VE MENTIONED IT -- WAS THE CHANGE -- FROM THE PRUDENCE THE PRESUMPTION OF PRUDENCE RATHER THAN THE PRESUMPTION OF IMPRUDENCE. OF MORE ALIGNED TO THE FOR MODEL OF DOING THAT -- IN YOU MENTIONED THAT THAT IS THE CASE CAN YOU CAN YOU EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT OF THE HISTORY BEHIND THE C. P. UC'S PRESUMPTION. OF PRUDENCE AND HOW THAT CAME ABOUT AND AND WHAT YOU CAN DIG DOWN A LITTLE BIT INTO THAT WHOLE ISSUE OF OF DETERMINE LIABILITY AND PRUDENCE. SURE SO THE THE WAY IN WHICH THAT THE P. YOU SEE CURRENTLY DOES. PREVIOUSLY REQUIRES THAT THE UTILITIES PROVE BEYOND PROPONENTS OF EVIDENCE THAT COSTS ARE JUST AND REASONABLE. AND THAT IS THE STANDARD A METHOD THAT'S USED ACROSS ALMOST ALL PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AND ACROSS OTHER MATTERS THAT ARE DEALT WITH IN THE P. YOU SEE -- THERE HASN'T BEEN MUCH EXPERIENCE WITH LITIGATING COSTS RELATED TO CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES HAS ONLY BEEN ONE PARTICULAR CASE BEFORE THE PC. THE PC DECIDED NOT TO PASS ALONG THOSE COST OF THOUGH -- THAT SHOULD NOT BE A SOON TO BE PRESIDENT FOR OUR FUTURE CASES. I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HEARD WHICH IS A CHALLENGES THAT. THIS IS IN RELATIVELY NEW AREA FOR THINKING ABOUT WHAT IS PRUDENT. AND SO DETERMINING WHAT PRUDENT BEHAVIOR IS CAN BE CHALLENGING AND OVER TIME IT SHOULD BE EASIER AS WE HAVE THINGS LIKE THE WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS ACTIVE. AND MORE COLLECTIVE EXPERIENCE. BUT GIVEN THAT THE LIMóN EXPERIENCE WE HAVE. ENDED I THINK SIGNIFICANT CONCERN FROM INVESTORS THAT IT'S NOT CLEAR UP FRONT WHAT THE UTILITY SHOULD BE DOING. WE TRIED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WOULD BE A REASONABLE STEP AT THIS TIME -- IN TERMS OF RECONCILING SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS IN NOT WANTING TO WE ACTUALLY RECOMMEND AGAINST HAVING A PRESET STAY AT A PRE SET LIST. OF ACTIVITIES THAT ARE CONSIDERED PRUDENT BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S TOO MUCH SHORT TOO PREMATURE TO DO THAT -- BUT WE DO THINK. THAT IS NOT UNREASONABLE TO DO IT FOR DOES WHICH IS ASSUME THAT THE UTILITIES HAVE BEEN PRUDENT. AND THEN COLLECT EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY THIS IS NOT MEAN THE UTILITY DOESN'T HAVE TO MAKE ITS CASE THEY DO -- BUT IT DOES SHIFT THE BURDEN -- I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS A DEVIATION FROM CURRENT PRACTICE AND SO I THINK TO BE SUCCESSFUL IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT INTERVENOR IS THE OFFICER SAFETY ENFORCEMENT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO THEIR OWN ANALYSIS THEIR OWN MODELING AND THAT THEY GET SUFFICIENT DATA. DISCOVERY FROM THE UTILITIES THE AND THAT WAS MY FIRST GOING TO BE MY FINAL QUESTION HOW WOULD THEY GET. IF WE CHANGE THAT STANDARD HOW WOULD THEN THE INTERVENOR WHOEVER'S INVOLVED IN TRYING TO DETERMINE THAT PRUDENCE OR IMPROVING STANDARD. HOW WOULD THEY GET THE DATA THE INFORMATION AND -- IT'S NECESSARY TO BUILD A CASE IF NECESSARY AND SO I THINK IT WOULD BE THE SAME WAY THAT THEY CURRENTLY GET THAT INFORMATION -- IF THEY'RE ALLOWED TO GET ACCESS THROUGH. THEY TO DISCOVERY THERE WOULD BE A ACTIVE PROCEEDING -- I THINK THIS IS REALLY GETTING INTO SOME FINER POINTS OF THE WEEDS BY PROCESS WHERE YOU NEED TO GO IS MAKING SURE THAT PARTIES HAVE ACCESS TO INTERVIEW -- COMPENSATION TO HIRE CONSULTANTS AN ANALYST TO DO A SUPPORT THIS WORK. AND I WILL SAY THIS IS NOT ME IN THE EYE YOU TO THE P. YOU SEE ULTIMATELY MAINTAINS ITS DISCRETION IN THIS CASE -- AND WE'LL WAIT THE EVIDENCE -- BUT IT DOES PROVIDE SOME SHIFTED THE BURDEN WITHOUT ASSUMING AUTOMATIC COST RECOVERY. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU. CENTER MORE LIKE. MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU MISS PETERMAN JUST A FEW QUICK QUESTIONS THE FIRST THIS IS MORE OF A DETAIL ORIENTED -- AS YOU LOOK INTO UTILITY. ACTIVITY THERE'S A ARE A RULE. TWENTY EIGHT AND B. AND ALLOWS FOR CREDITS AND BE ABLE TO USE THOSE THOSE FUNDS FOR BEAUTIFICATION TO PERHAPS UNDERGROUND. CERTAIN A UTILITY LINES WHAT WAS THAT REVIEWED BY YOUR COMMITTEE. IT WAS NOT. A MODELS -- WE HAVE YOU KNOW IN CALIFORNIA SOME I USE THAT HAVE DONE WELL ON BEEN PROACTIVE AND WE'VE GOT ONE THAT'S CREATED PLENTY OF I MEDIA. ATTENTION. AND WE HAVE OTHER STATES THAT ALSO HAVE. FIRE RISKS SO DO WE LOOK AT MODELS OF HERE'S HOW DID UTILITY SHOULD RUN HERE'S HOW IT'S DONE IN. A STATE THAT HASN'T HAD THE PROBLEMS REVIEWS WE'VE AT SO MAKE A COUPLE OBSERVATIONS ALONG THOSE LINES -- AS A PART OF FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THE WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLAN PROCEEDING AT THE P. YOU SEE. THEY DID TAKE INFORMATION AND REVIEW WHAT ARE SOME OF THE BEST PRACTICES IN THIS AREA -- AND SO THERE'S SOME EXAMPLES OUT THERE. OTHER STATES HAVE NOT HAD FIRES OF THIS SIZE NOR DO THEY HAVE THE AMOUNT FRANKLY OF LAND AND PROPERTY VALUE IN HARM'S WAY AND SO THEY HAVE NOT HAD BECAUSE THE SAME LEVEL OF DAMAGE TO DEAL WITH. WE DID GET A PRESENTATION FROM THE P. YOU SEE IN OUR FIRST MEETING THAT TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE GEOGRAPHIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE UTILITIES WHICH WILL MAKE SURE TO PROVIDE. TO YOUR COMMITTEE BUT ONE THING THAT IS STRIKING IS THE SIZE OF THE TERRITORIES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND HOW MUCH OF THAT TERRITORY IS IN A HI WILDFIRE RISK AREA. P. JEANNIE AND WE'LL JUST PUT MANAGEMENT QUESTIONS AND ISSUES ASIDE HAS A TERRITORY THAT IS MORE AT RISK. P. JEANNIE ALSO HAS A LOWER PERCENTAGE OF UNDER GROUNDING AND THAT'S ACTUALLY A RESULT OF LAW IN ONE OF THINGS THAT WE HAVE LEARNED ABOUT WAS THERE'S A LAW ON THE SIXTIES. THAT MEANT THAT NEW COULD RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITIES HAD UNDER GROUNDING WIRES AND SO SAN DIEGO DEVELOP LATER AND HAS A GREATER PERCENTAGE OF WIRES UNDERGROUND. STILL P. GENIE IS STARTING AT A DIFFERENT PLACE -- AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE LESSONS FROM THE OTHER UTILITIES BUT ALSO THINK ABOUTJUST PRACTICALLY WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ON THE GROUND -- FOR EACH OF THEM. THE LAST QUESTION AND I DON'T KNOW HOW. TO KEEP IT SHORT BUT WE'VE UP WITH A PAINTING HERE. AND AND I NEED TO MOVE ELECTRICITY FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER. SO I NEED. TO TALK TO THE OWNER THEIR PROPERTY WHETHER IT'S FEDERAL STATE OR PRIVATE. SAY I NEED TO MOVE THIS BUT CRITICS HAVE CUSTOMERS AND I I NEED TO DO IT. SO STARTING JUST FROM SCRATCH LIKE THE LIKE WE'RE JUST STARTING WITH A CLEAN SLATE. HOW WOULD I NEGOTIATE WITH THE UTILITIES SAY HEY I YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND COME THROUGH MY PROPERTY? BUT HERE THE THINGS YOU NEED TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT MY PROPERTY IS NOT. ENDANGERED OR AT RISK AND WHAT KIND OF POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WHAT I PUT IN PLACE. THAT'S THE BIG QUESTION WHICH I DON'T HAVE A GREAT ANSWER FOR IT BUT I'LL SAY. THERE ARE RULES AND SUCH IN PLACE REGARDING WHAT ACCESS TO THE RIGHT AWAY MEANS AND WHAT MAINTENANCE HAS TO BE DONE -- THERE SEVERAL GENERAL ORDERS RELATED TO THAT SO I WOULD GO BACK AND LOOK AND AT THE EXISTING ORDERS AND SAY ARE THEY SUFFICIENT ENOUGH -- I WILL SAY THAT THERE HAVE BEEN UPDATES TO THE RULES AROUND VEGETATION MANAGEMENT -- OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS AS RESPONSE TO THE FIRES AND SO -- ONE QUESTION WILL BE DO THEY GO FAR ENOUGH -- BUT FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE SOME OF THE MOST AGGRESSIVE RULES IN PLACE FOR PROTECTION OF THE RIGHT AWAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER SIR JACKSON. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I SHARE THE H. -- APPRECIATION OF MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE KNOWING YOUR LONG STANDING WORK IN IN THIS AREA AND OTHERS AND YOUR INTELLECT AND AN ABILITY. TO SORT OF CULL THROUGH LAW TO DIFFICULT SCENARIOS -- IN PREPARING THIS REPORT -- I'M WONDERING WHAT WAS YOUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. WHAT WAS YOUR NUMBER ONE FOCUS IN THIS EFFORT? SO I WOULD SAY AT LARGE IT WAS RECOMMENDING A SERIES OF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CAN PUT CALIFORNIA ON THE RIGHT PATH. AND BY RIGHT PATH I MEAN A WILDFIRE. RISKS. SITUATION A UTILITY HEALTH SITUATION. THAT MADE WILD FIRE VICTIMS BETTER OFF THAT MAKE CUSTOMERS WHO LIVE IN THE WILDLY INTERVENE INTERFACE BETTER OFF. AND THAT MAKE ELECTRIC CUSTOMERS BETTER OFF [inaudible] SO. I SIT HERE IN IN MY NUMBER ONE CONCERN -- AS SOMEONE WHO IS BEEN THROUGH A NUMBER OF THESE EVENTS. BASED UPON WHERE I LIVE BASED UPON. THE INTENSITY OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND BASED UPON HAVING JUST HAD. ONE OF THE MAJOR FIRES IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. MY CONCERN IS PUBLIC SAFETY. AND OF PROTECTING LIFE AND PROPERTY. SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT -- THE CONCERN OF CHANGING THE BURDEN. OF FROM A STRICT LIABILITY -- TO A FAULT BASED SYSTEM. THE FIRST THING THAT COMES TO MY MIND IS THAT WE'VE HAD A STRICT LIABILITY SYSTEM. AND YET THOSE COMPANIES WHO. RECOGNIZE THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE LIABLE IF THEIR EQUIPMENT CAUSES OF FIRE -- HAVEN'T TAKEN THAT RESPONSIBILITY PARTICULARLY SERIOUSLY. IF WE THEN REDUCE THAT REQUIREMENT TO A FALSE A FULL TO BASED STANDARD HOW IS IT THAT WE'RE GOING TO FIND THOSE COMPANIES. TAKING THEIR RESPONSIBILITY SERIOUSLY WHEN THEY NO LONGER ARE GOING TO BE HELD LAW OR LIKELY TO BE HELD A 100%. LIABLE. SO IT COULD YOU COULD YOU EXPLAIN THE THINKING ON THAT BECAUSE IF THEY'RE NOT WILLING TO DO WHAT THEY SHOULD DO TO PROTECT AGAINST CEASE FIRES NOW WITH A WITH ESSENTIALLY AN ABSOLUTE LIABILITY HOW DO YOU THINK. OF THAT THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE THAT RESPONSIBILITY SERIOUSLY WHEN THEIR LIABILITY IS ACTUALLY REDUCED. SO I THINK THAT THE MOTIVATION FOR TAKING A FIRE SERIOUSLY IS FIRST OF ALL. IT JUST STARTING TO UNDERSTAND THE LIKELIHOOD IN PREVALENCE OF THESE FIRES REALLY UNDERSTANDING THE WILD FIRE RISK. AND THEN ALSO IDENTIFYING WATER WAYS IN WHICH TO MITIGATE THAT RISK AND THOSE ARE BOTH THINGS THAT I THINK WE'VE ALL COLLECTIVELY COME TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF IN THE LAST. TWELVE TO TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. AND SO WE DID NOT GET TESTIMONY FROM THE UTILITIES AND THAT THE PRESENCE OF THAT STRICT LIABILITY STANDARD WAS THE MOTIVATING FACTOR IN TERMS OF THEM REDUCING WILD FIRE RISK. SO I THINK THE WAY THAT WE GET THAT ACTION IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE YOU REQUIRE MEDICATION THAT WE INVEST IN MITIGATION. AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS. WHY I CAME TO THE PLACE OF UNDERSTANDING AND BELIEVING THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR UTILITIES? BUT PEOPLE WANT INVEST IN OUR UTILITIES BECAUSE WE NEED THAT INVESTMENT IN ORDER TO FUND THIS MEDICATION THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. I THINK ONCE YOU START SETTING THE STANDARDS IN PLACE AND YOU PUT IN A PLACE. TO HAVE THE STANDARDS INVOLVED THEN YOU MAKE SURE THAT IF UTILITY MANAGEMENT DOES NOT ACT PRUDENTLY THAT THERE ARE FINES AND PENALTIES. I THINK AGAIN OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS OUR COLLECTIVE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS PRUDENT MANAGE IT WHAT IT WHAT IS BEING A PRINT MANAGER WILL BECOME MORE CLEAR. AND THEN IT'LL BE EASIER. TO THE WHOLE THE UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE. WHEN THEY'RE AT FAULT SO. YOU SAY THAT OUR COLLECTIVE UNDERSTANDING OF PRUDENT MANAGEMENT WILL BECOME CLEAR WHO IS GOING TO MAKE THIS CLEAR ARE WE GOING TO LOOK TO THE P. YOU SEE. BECAUSE THE P. YOU SEE -- HS ACKNOWLEDGE I THINK A ONE OF OUR HEARINGS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY THEY'RE NOT EXPERTS IN THIS FIELD. SO WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO BE LOOKING -- TO GET ASSURANCES AT SO THAT THE PUBLIC HAS CONFIDENCE THAT THERE THAT THERE IS PRUDENT MANAGEMENT OF OUR ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS SO THAT WE ARE WHEN WHEN SOMEONE COMES AND SAYS -- I'M NOT SURE I WANT TO LET YOU PUT AN EASEMENT ACROSS MY LAND. NOW WE HAVE TO DO THAT AND THAT'S WHEN THE REASONS WE HAVE INVERSE CONDEMNATION. RIGHT BECAUSE YOU ARE TAKING AWAY SOMEONE'S ENJOYMENT OF THEIR PROPERTY -- IN ORDER FOR A GREATER GOOD THEORETICALLY AND IF SOMETHING HAPPENS THAT IMPAIRS THAT ENJOYMENT THE I AEA FIRE. THAT THAT COMPANY OR WHOEVER IT IS NEEDS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT SO. HOW WE GONNA GET TO THAT PLACE -- WHO'S GOING TO BE THE ONE TO DECIDE WHAT PRUDENT MANAGEMENT IS. OUR RECOMMENDATION IS STILL TO MAINTAIN THAT FUNCTION AT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. AS YOU NOTED THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION MAY HAVE TOLD YOU THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THAT EXPERTISE AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE EXPERTISE THE WAY THAT HAVE THE EXPERTISE SURROUNDS -- OTHER INVESTMENTS I CAN GAS FOR EXAMPLE BUT I THINK THE CHALLENGES THERE'S THE EXPERTISE ISN'T WIDELY OUT THERE PERIOD RIGHT BECAUSE WE'RE TAKING ABOUT A COMBINATION OF THINGS IT'S WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO SAFELY OPERATE ONE INDIVIDUAL PIECE OF EQUIPMENT. WHICH THERE IS A LOT OF EXPERIENCE ON AND THEN WHAT IS IT MEAN TO OPERATE THAT EQUIPMENT SAFELY GIVEN THE POSSIBILITY THAT IT MIGHT IGNITE A FIRE WHICH MAY LEAD TO A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF HUMAN AND ECONOMIC DAMAGE. WHICH IS HARD TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH THAT WILL BE AND SO THERE'S A SEVERAL THINGS THAT HAPPEN BETWEEN AT MISSION AND WHEN WE GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE HAVE WILD FIRE VICTIMS AND I THINK WHAT ARE REPORTING KNOWLEDGES. IS THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS THAT HAVE SOME ROLE IN THAT PROCESS AND THEREFORE WE THINK THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MEDICATION INVESTMENT AND RECOVERY OF COSTS SHOULD SPREAD ACROSS ALL THOSE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS -- I'LL JUST SAY ALSO IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING TO THAT THE P. YOU SEE IS DEVELOPING ITS CAPACITY MORE -- BUT THAT'S WHY WE SAID IF THERE IS A NOTHER ENTITY THAT THE STATE FEELS MORE COMFORTABLE WITH CONCENTRATING THAT KNOWLEDGE IN THAT IS SOMETHING WORTH PURSUING AS WELL WHEN I TALK TO EXPERTS OUT THERE EVERYONE'S TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT AT THE SAME TIME INSURANCE COMPANIES UTILITIES THE REGULATORS. ABOUT WHAT IS A REASONABLE MITIGATION -- AND HAD OF THOSE COSTS COMPARE WITH OTHER COST THAT WE WANT INVESTMENT YOU WANT THE TILDE THREE MAKING. SO IF I MET ONE LAST QUESTION. SO -- WE LOOK NOW OUR I THINK MANY OF US LOOK NOW TO THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE BY SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC IS A RESULT OF THE PC HOLDING THEM RESPONSIBLE IF YOU WELL WITHOUT THE ABILITY. TO GET REIMBURSED AND I GUESS IT'S UNDER JUDICIAL REVIEW BUT AT THAT POINT IN TIME I THINK WAS. TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THEY WENT OUT TO A AND CREATED A SYSTEM THAT HAS USED THE THE BEST PRACTICES THEY CREATED USING TECHNOLOGY IS SYSTEM WHICH NOW HAS HAD I THINK A SIGNIFICANT -- A POSITIVE IMPACT ON MITIGATING THOSE POTENTIAL WILDFIRES. SO WHEN YOU -- CONSIDER. THAT THIS HAS BEEN DONE THAT THERE HAS BEEN SUFFICIENT MOTIVATION. AND IT WAS A COST BASED MOTIVATION IF YOU WILL FROM THE FIRE I THINK IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE OR TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN IN THAT AREA. WE WE HAVE SEEN AN EXAMPLE WHEN A COMPANY YOU UNDERSTAND SO IT'S BASICALLY THEY'RE ON THE HOOK. TO GO OUT INTO DO THESE THINGS THAT YOU GET A WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BEING DONE THEN YOU HAVE A COMPANY LIKE P. JEANNIE. THAT HAS SEEN ITSELF MORE I WOULD SAY AS A PRIVATE ENTITY GIVING BONUSES TO ITSELF AND AND DOING THINGS THAT HAVE REALLY NOT BEEN NECESSARILY IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC. HOW DO YOU? IF YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU BALANCE THOSE TWO HOW DO YOU JUSTIFY. REDUCING A LIABILITY COMPONENT. WHERE YOU SEE ONE ONE COMPANY TOOK IT PRETTY SERIOUSLY? AND WITH THE STATE OF THE ART PROGRAM AND ANOTHER THE KEEPS INSISTING UPON GIVING BONUSES TO ITSELF AND TO ITS PEOPLE AND THEN RUNNING INTO THE BANKRUPTCY COURT WE SAW THIS TWENTY YEARS AGO -- WHEN THEY DON'T LIKE? THE LIABILITIES THAT THEY'VE. CREATED FOR THEMSELVES SO. HOW HOW DO WE EXPLAIN THIS TO THE PUBLIC HOW DO WE AND AND MOST IMPORTANTLY HOW DO WE PROTECT AGAINST THESE KINDS OF FIRES -- GIVEN CHOICES THAT ARE BEING MADE BY ONE COMPANY OVER ANOTHER. ONE ONE OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. RELATES TO WILDFIRE FIND AND WHAT WE ARE VERY EXPLICIT ABOUT IS HOW MUCH A UTILITY SHOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THAT FUN SHOULD BE TIED TO THEIR ACTUARIAL RISK. SO AND THAT COULD BE A FUNCTION OF BOTH THEIR WILDFIRE GEOGRAPHY RISK AS WELL AS THEIR PAST EXPERIENCE OF WILDFIRES SO IN THAT SITUATION YOU EXPECTED UTILITY LIKE P. JEANNIE. TO GROW TO BEAR A GREATER SHARE OF THE COST -- SANDY -- GAS AND ELECTRIC HAS DEMONSTRATED NOW WORLD CLASS TECHNOLOGY WITH WILD FIRE DETECTION AND PREVENTION. I WILL SAY THAT THEY MADE THOSE INVESTMENTS YEARS BEFORE THE P. YOU SEE DECIDED ON WHETHER THEY COULD RECOVER THOSE COSTS THE P. YOU SEATED INSIDE ON THAT. TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND WHAT WE HEARD FROM AT THE G. REPRESENTATIVES IN OUR FORUM WAS. THEY JUST SAID YOU NEVER AGAIN WE DON'T WANT TO FIRE THAT BAD IN OUR TERRITORY EVER AGAIN SO WE'RE GOING TO DO WHAT IT TAKES -- THE WHAT WE HEARD WAS NOT THAT IT WAS A DIRECT RESPONSE TO STRICT LIABILITY ALTHOUGH OF COURSE THAT CAN BE A FACTOR AND SO. ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK WE NEED TO BE SENSITIVE TO TO A SAN DIEGO HAS DONE IS THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO USE CAMERAS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO FIGURE OUT WHEN THE SHUT OFF THE POWER. BUT NOT NECESSARILY HOW TO QUICKLY STOP A FIRE SO THERE ARE THESE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES. WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO A FIRE DAMAGE BUT I DO THINK THOSE ARE ALL TECHNOLOGIES AND INVESTMENTS THAT ARE UTILITIES NEED TO BE DOING. BUT I KNOW THAT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION ORDERED TO THE OTHER UTILITIES TO DO OR THE LEGISLATURE DID AS WELL AND SO I THINK WE ARE NOW IN A PLACE. WHERE WE REALLY LOOK AT THIS CLOSELY AND SAID OKAY HERE THE TYPES OF THINGS WE WANT TO SEE? BUT THEY DO CONTRIBUTE TO COST SAN DIEGO HAS THE HIGHEST ELECTRIC RATES OF ALL THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WERE STRUCK BY IN THE TESTIMONY WE GOT. WAS HOW ELECTRIC RATES ARE GOING UP IN PARTICULAR HOW ELECTRIC CUSTOMERS ARE PAYING FOR WHILE FIRE MITIGATION IN ADDITION TO DAMAGE. AS WE DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE SENSITIVE TO THAT IMPACT WHICH IS WHY WE RECOMMEND MORE BROADLY SOCIALIZING THE COST. THANK CENTER CENTER HERTZBERG. THE MISMATCH CHAIRMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SETTING. THIS HEARING TODAY ON YOUR BIRTHDAY YOUR GREAT COMMITMENT TO PUBLIC SERVICES DEMONSTRATED HERE. BIRTHDAY AND I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT DESPITE THE REFERENCES THERE WILL BE NO EASEMENTS AT THE ASSEMBLY. I DON'T THINK THAT'S HAPPENING. THERE JACKSON TALKED ABOUT BOND HOW TO EXPLAIN THIS TO THE PUBLIC. YOU TALKED ABOUT ON A SERIES OF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE CAN PUT -- PUT US ON THE RIGHT PATH -- I THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA ARE WATCHING AND I WOULD SAY THAT. IN IN THE OTHER POINT YOU MADE THAT PEOPLE WANT TO INVEST IN OUR UTILITIES. I LOOK AT YOUR FIRST RECOMMENDATION THE CORE WITHOUT JUDGMENT AND SAY IT'S CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION. SO HERE WE ARE WERE DELIVERED BY THE RATING AGENCIES A DOCUMENT THAT SAYS. THAT UNLESS LEGISLATION PASSES THAT REDUCES THE CREDIT RISK TO CALIFORNIA LOOK TO TELL THESE ARE CURRENT EXPECTATIONS YOU TO DOWNGRADE UTILITIES AT AROUND JULY TWELFTH. WE'RE GOING TO FACE A DOWNGRADE WE FURTHER HAVE ONE OF OUR INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES IN BANKRUPTCY ANYBODY WHO'S EVER BEEN A LAWYER DEALING WITH BANKRUPTCY COURTS MISSILE CASKEY KNOW. THAT IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO GET ANY RESOLUTION. SO IF WE'RE GOING TO TAKE YOUR COURSE OF ACTION WE'RE GONNA DAN PASSED BY TWO THIRDS VOTES OF BOTH HOUSES OF THE LEGISLATURE SOMETHING TO PUT ON THE BALLOT FOR NOTE THE ASTEST WAY POSSIBLE MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY RIGHT. N. WERE FACED AT THE SAME TIME WITH THIS ISSUE OF THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY IN IN IN IN IN THE NORTH HAVING ITS CHALLENGES THE RATING AGENCIES SAYING WHAT THEY'RE SAYING. HOW IS THAT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AT LEAST GOT INFORMED BY THE THE ADVICE YOU GAVE OF PUTTING US ON THE RIGHT PATH BOTH INSPIRING INVESTMENT IN THE UTILITIES? AND MAKING SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM HOW DO WE REACH THAT BALANCE I'M TRYING TO LISTEN TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN EARNEST LISTENING TO WHAT THE GOVERNOR DID IN EARNEST ABOUT BUT WE CERTAINLY KNOW WE'RE IN A TOUGH SITUATION. BUT THE QUESTION IS DO THESE RECOMMENDATIONS REALLY PUT US ON A PATH TO TO TO CHEAT THE DELIVERABLES THAT YOU TALK ABOUT PARTICULARLY. IN THE EVENT WE HAVE ANOTHER WILDFIRE. IN A VASE MERE -- IN IN THE NEAR TERM. SO I WOULD. READ ALL THESE RECOMMENDATIONS. AS A COMPLETE SET. I THINK ONE NEEDS TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT. PARSING OUT ANYONE ALONE BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THERE'S ONE RECOMMENDATION ALONE THAT GETS YOU. A SOLUTION AND SO. ALWAYS MENTION THE FIRST ONE FIRST BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE FIRST DEALT WITH IT MAY MEASURE MENTION IT LAST -- BUT YOU KNOW JUST BEGIN TAKING A STEP BACK ABOUT. AT A HIGH LEVEL YOU KNOW HOW I THINK THROUGH THESE RECOMMENDATIONS. YEAH WE WERE ASKED TO LOOK AT HOW DO WE ASK WHO ACTUALLY ALLOCATE COST. AND THE INTERPRETATION OF THE STRICT LIABILITY -- THE STRICT LIABILITY INTERPRETATION OF THE INVERSE CONDEMNATION DOCTRINE MEANS THAT THESE COST FALL TO UTILITY SHAREHOLDERS AND REPAIRS. AND OTHER STATES THEY FALL TO A BROADER SET OF INDIVIDUALS SO. THAT IS ONE WAY TO THINK ABOUT SOCIALIZING COSTS MORE BROADLY IS THE CHANGE THAT INTERPRETATION. IF THAT INTERPRETATION IS NOT CHANGED THEN WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE THESE COSTS FALL TO SHAREHOLDERS AND RATE PAYERS AND INVESTORS ARE SAYING WE THINK IT'S A VERY RISKY INVESTMENT FOR US TO INVEST IN UTILITIES WHERE THERE'S AN UNCAPPED THE LIABILITY FOR SHAREHOLDERS. WE'RE GOING TO ASK THAT ALL THOSE COSTS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE FALL TWO ELECTRIC CUSTOMERS. LEAD TO IS THAT FAIR GIVEN THAT THESE ELECTRIC CUSTOMERS. ARE JUST A DIFFERENT NAME FOR CALIFORNIANS BUT IT'S ALL ABOUT KIND OF HOW MUCH ELECTRICITY USE. WE GOT LOTS OF EVIDENCE THAT ELECTRIC CUSTOMER KOSTER INCREASING AND WE'RE ASKING ELECTRIC CUSTOMERS TO INVEST IN THE MITIGATION. AND PAY FOR THE DAMAGE. AND SO THAT LED TO THE RECOMMENDATION OF A FUND -- WITH ONE MORE THING. WHEN WE LOOK AT COST RECOVERY WE HAD TO ADDRESS THIS QUESTION ABOUT HOW DO YOU MAKE IT? MORE REASONABLE TO INVEST IN CALIFORNIA TILL THESE BECAUSE WE LOOK AT WHY PEOPLE INVESTING UTILITIES THERE'S A CAP UPSIDE TO INVESTING IN UTILITY YOU KNOW THAT WE SET THE RATE OF RETURN. THEY'RE CONSIDERED HISTORICALLY PRETTY SAFE INVESTMENTS AND ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING OR MAKING THEM MORE RISKY INVESTMENTS AND THAT'S GOING TO COST MORE ULTIMATELY. FOR RATEPAYERS IN TERMS OF WHAT THE UTILITIES HAVE TO BORROW. SO THEN WE GET TO THE QUESTION OF IF YOU CAN'T HAVE ALL THE LET YOUR CUSTOMERS PAY FOR THESE LIABILITIES THAT ARE TEN ELEVEN TIMES WITH THE INSURANCE CAN COVER. THEN HOW DO WE MORE BROADLY SOCIALIZING WHICH IS WHY HE RECOMMENDED A FUN WHICH TAKES US BACK TO SOCIALIZING ACROSS PROPERTY OWNERS. THE EASIEST MIGHT BE TO SOCIALIZE ACOSTA TAXPAYERS WHICH ALMOST GET YOU BACK FULL CIRCLE TO WHAT A CHANGE TO THE INVERSE CONDEMNATION DOCTRINE WOULD DO AND SO THAT'S HOW THESE THINGS ALL IN A RELAY IT REALLY GETS TO WE'VE GOT LIABILITIES. BEYOND WHAT WE COULD IMAGINE IT'S OUR BIGGEST RECOMMENDATION WHICH I JUST TO START WITH IS REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF WILD FIRE RISK WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT THERE'S MORE FINANCIAL MECHANISMS AVAILABLE TO US THEY'LL BE MORE INSURANCE AVAILABLE MORE THINGS LIKE CATASTROPHIC BONDS THE SMALLER THE RISK. AND WE ARE TAKING THE STEPS NINE A ONE IS TAKING US IN THAT DIRECTION BUT WE KNOW THAT WILL TAKE SOME TIME AND SO I THINK THE CHALLENGE FOR OUR COMMISSION WAS. WE WE REALLY NEED PROTECTION IS IN THESE NEXT FEW YEARS. AND THE THINGS THAT GIVE US THEIR GIVE US THAT BUFFER GIVE US THAT BACKSTOP ARE HARD TO DO. SO WE HAVE TRIED TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS COULD BE A TEMPORARY ISSUE MAYBE THIS YOU NEED TO KNOW A FINE THAT'S REALLY GONNA BE LIQUID FOR TEN YEARS AND OVER TIME IT'LL TELL OUT. MAYBE WANT TO THINK ABOUT COST RECOVERY FOR FORM THAT WAY REVISITING YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT AGAIN IN SEVERAL YEARS BUT FOR NOW. I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO RECOMMEND HOW DO YOU. YEAH HOW DO YOU STOP OF THE INCREASING COST OF CERTAINTY AND UNTIL THERE SOME REAL CLEAR DIRECTION ABOUT WHERE THIS ENDS I THINK WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO SEE. POTENTIALLY YOU KNOW MORE DOWNGRADES MORE BANKRUPTCIES AND LESS RESOLUTION FOR WELFARE VICTIMS I GUESS FOLLOWS GERMANS ONE MOMENT THAT'S EXACTLY I'M TRYING TO GET TO GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE JUST GOT THIS FROM. WE GOT MOODY'S REPORT NOW WE JUST GOT THE REPORT FROM FROM -- STANDARD AND POOR'S THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION IF YOU WANTED TO TALK ABOUT. THE INVERSE AND IT REQUIRES A BALLOT INITIATIVE FOR PEOPLE TO BE COMFORTABLE THERE'S NO WAY THE THE YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT THE SITUATION WE HAVE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES AS I SEE IT. AND THEY NEED TO BE STABILIZE IT CROSSES FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A WEEK WHEN CENTER JACKSON AYE WERE HERE SOME TIME AGO. AT THE STATE ACTUALLY PAYING THOSE COSTS CORRECT AND SO THE QUESTION IS. WHAT'S UP WITH THE SUCH AS THE BROUGHT IDEAS FOR A PIECE OF PAPER WE'RE NOW IN A SITUATION WHERE WE'RE TOLD BY STANDARD AND POOR'S YOU GOT TO JULY TWELFTH LADIES AND GENTLEMAN. AND PART OF THAT IS GOING TO BE THIS ODD SITUATION YOU CORRECTLY IDENTIFY IS TO INSPIRE-CONFIDENCE THE EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY. WE HAD THIS HORRIBLE EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY THE COMMUNITIES THAT I REPRESENT AND THE GOOD NEWS IS WE HAVEN'T HAD ANOTHER BIG EARTHQUAKE SO WE HAVING A PROBLEM WE DON'T HAVE ANOTHER BIG WILD FIRE. BUT THIS BANKRUPTCY IN THIS IN SECURITY IS CAUSED BY THE CONCERN THAT WE MIGHT. AND SO OUR JOB IS TO PROTECT AGAINST IF WE MIKE TO GIVE CONFIDENCE AS YOU SUGGESTED FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO INVEST IN THEIR UTILITIES IN CALIFORNIA SO IT SEEMS TO ME. IS A FOUNDATIONAL QUESTION AS WE APPROACH THIS PROBLEM SOLVING WE HAVE TO BE GUIDED AT ITS CORE ADDITIONALLY BY HOW MUCH CAPITAL IS GOING TO COST US WHAT'S IT GOING TO COST RATE PAYERS AND EVERYBODY ELSE. IF PEOPLE DON'T HAVE CONFIDENCE AND THE RATINGS ARE TURN ARE ARE TURNED INTO JUNK WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE TRIPLE A RATING BONDS AND SO EVERY DECISION WE MAKE. HAVE TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE PROCESS AND MAYBE AT THE END OF THAT PROCESS YOU COULD LOOK AT THE LIABILITY ISSUE BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE LEAD OFF FROM. AND THAT WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH AT THE CORE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING. INSPIRING CONFIDENCE IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS SO THAT PEOPLE KNOW THAT THAT THEIR COST OF BORROWING COST OF THE UTILITY RATES ARE NOT GOING TO GO UP AND THAT THERE'S MONEY AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR VICTIMS. AND SERVE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND I JUST TALK ABOUT THIS IN BROAD TERMS THIS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE THE PLACE WITH THE PRACTICAL HAPPENS WITH THE RUBBR MEETS THE ROAD AND WE HAVE TO FIGURE THAT SOLUTION. AND WHAT THE IMPLEMENTATION LOOKS LIKE. THE END I DON'T DISAGREE I THINK THE LAST POINT I WOULD MAKE IS THAT ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE DIFFERENT TIME HORIZONS AND HAVE. DIFFERENT LEGAL CHALLENGES AND SO -- I THINK YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN MAY THE I THINK THE REPORS NOTE THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE A CHANGE THE COST RECOVERY STANDARD THAT'S PROBABLY THE MOST DIRECTING THAT YOU CAN DO -- TO INCREASE INVESTOR CONFIDENCE. WE WANT TO BE SENSITIVE TO THE FACT THAT THAT ON ITS OWN COULD JUST SHIFT COSTS ONLY TO ELECTRIC CUSTOMERS WHICH WILL NOT BE SUSTAINABLE -- BUT I APPRECIATE THE CHALLENGE BEFORE YOU. THE SPEARMAN THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH -- FOR ALL THE TIMES I SAID EARLIER -- THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND AFTER THAT'S GONE INTO THIS IS JUST INCREDIBLY PROCEED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR UNLESS THAT CONTAIN LESS KNOW HOW WE CAN BE OF SERVICE [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] COMMISSIONER LARA. WANT TO THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME -- TO JOIN US TODAY. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IS DONE SOME EXTENSIVE WORK ON THE ISSUE OF WILDFIRES. AND THEIR IMPACT ON RESIDENTIAL INSURANCE. THE DEPARTMENT PUBLISHED A REPORT ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO ON THE AVAILABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY OF COVERAGE FOR WHILE FAR LOSS. IN RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY INSURANCE IN THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE AND OTHER HIGH RISK AREAS OF CALIFORNIA. THEREFORE YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THE DISCUSSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE COMMISSION REPORT WILL BE VERY HELPFUL TO OUR WORK I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU COMING THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER MEMBERS -- IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE AGAIN -- AS YOU KNOW SINCE TAKING OFFICE HE BEEN WORKING TOWARDS ASSISTING VICTIMS OF THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN WILDFIRES WITH INSURANCE CLAIMS. BEING THE MAJOR FOCUS OF MY DEPARTMENT DURING THE LAST HANDFUL OF MONTHS -- WE HAVE VISITED -- PARADISE AGORA HILLS MALIBU CHICO SANTA ROSA AT THE DEPARTMENT AND HAVE HAVE HELD MULTIPLE WORKSHOPS TO HELP HOMEOWNERS HOMEOWNERS NAVIGATE THEIR POLICIES. WE WILL ALSO ORGANIZE THE WELFARE RESILIENCE SUMMIT. WHERE WILL WE INVITED INSURANCE COMMISSIONER IS ACTUALLY FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO COME TO CALIFORNIA TO VIEW THE DAMAGE OF THE CAMPFIRE AND ENGAGE IN POLICY DISCUSSIONS WITH OUR STATES? WITH OTHER STATES ON INSURANCE AND WHILE FAR RISK. A IT SHOULD BE CLEAR TO EVERYONE BY NOW THAT CALIFORNIA HAS THE MOST TO GAIN. OF ANY STATE -- FROM REDUCING THE RISK OF EXTREME WILDFIRES AND THE MOST TO LOSE IF RISKS ARE CONTINUE TO CLIMB. WE ALL NEED TO BE FOCUSED ON REDUCING RISK THE OF AVAILABILITY TO FIND AFFORDABLE INSURANCE IMPROVE THE WE REDUCE THE RISKS TO OUR COMMUNITIES WILDFIRES HAVE BEEN A PART OF CALIFORNIA FOR ENTIRE HISTORY BUT CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE GROWTH. OF OUR POPULATION CAN BE A DANGEROUS COMBINATION. LOCAL COMMUNITIES ARE ASKING WHAT CAN THEY DO TO REDUCE IMPACTS OF WILDFIRES WE NEED TO PROVIDE THE INCENTIVES THAT PROMOTE WHILE FIRE MITIGATION ACTIONS. INCLUDING STATEWIDE INITIATIVES THAT EMBRACE OUR NATURAL FOR STRUCTURE HARDEN EXISTING HOMES AND IMPROVE COMMUNITY LEVEL RESILIENCE. OUR DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE STAFF OF CONSULTED ON THE NINE ONE COMMISSION REPORT OUR DEPARTMENT PRESENTED MULTIPLE -- PRESENTED AT MULTIPLE COMMISSION MEETINGS AND PROVIDED NUMEROUS RECOMMENDATIONS AIMED AT KEEPING INSURANCE AFFORDABLE AND AVAILABLE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. AS YOU ALSO NOYCE ALSO SERVE ON THE GOVERNOR'S STRIKE TEAM. I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW RECOMMENDATIONS WITHIN THE NINE A ONE COMMISSION REPORT THAT I THINK PARTICULARLY STE OUR STRONG POLICY PROPOSALS AS THE SENATE ENGAGES IN DISCUSSIONS ON WILDFIRE POLICY. RELATED TO HOME HARDENING AND NON RENEWAL PROTECTION. UNDER INSURANCE AND IMPROVEMENTS TO THE FAIR PLAN AND THE CALIFORNIA ASSURANCE GUARANTEE ASSOCIATION. HOME HARDING THE RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE HOME HARDING IN THE INSURANCE CHAPTER ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. THE REPORT SUGGESTS CREATING A STATEWIDE STANDARD. OF FOR HARDING HOMES AND REQUIRING INSURERS TO WRITE POLICIES FOR HOMEOWNERS WHO MEET THAT STANDARD. HOME HARDING BENEFIT BENEFITS CONSUMERS INSURERS AND THE STATE BY REDUCING ANTICIPATED FUTURE LOSSES. THE KEY IS TO REQUIRE A CLEAR EFFECTIVE AND ACHIEVABLE BAR FOR HOMEOWNERS TO MEET. UP WE HAVE A WELL WE HAVE WELL RECOGNIZED A SUCCESSFUL MODEL TODAY IN THE WELFARE PARTNERS PROGRAM IN BOULDER COLORADO WHERE RISK REDUCTION STANDARD WITH THAT AND IF HOMEOWNER. MEETS SET THE SURE WERE RIGHT THE INSURANCE FOR THAT WHOLE PROPERTY. THAT GIVES HOMEOWNERS AND COMMUNITIESA CLEAR INCENTIVE TO MAKE EXPENDITURES TO DO THE WORK TO REDUCE THE RISK. UNDER INSURANCE AFTER EVERY WHILE FOR THAT WE SEE VICTIMS WHOSE -- INSURANCE LIMITS DO NOT COME EVEN CLOSE TO COVERING THE COST TO REBUILD. THE PROBLEM THIS PROBLEM DECREASES THE ABILITY FOR COMMUNITIES TO RECOVER FROM WILDFIRES AND HAS A RIPPING AFFECT IN THE ENTIRE STATE. IN AN ERA WHERE WE HAVE ACCESS TO MORE AND MORE DATA ON INSURANCE IS PERSISTENT. THIS IS WHY GETTING A LIMB GETTING THE LIMIT RIGHT ART FOR YOUR COVERAGE A OF AN INSURANCE POLICY IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. COVERAGE A IS A PORTION OF THE INSURANCE POLICY THAT COVERS THE COST OF REPAIRING REBUILDING AND REPLACING THE PHYSICAL STRUCTURE OF A PERSON'S HOME. HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS HAVING TO LOWER THE LIMIT IN YOUR COVERAGE A AFFECTS MULTIPLE OTHER PARTS OF YOUR HOMEOWNER'S POLICY INCLUDING YOUR ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSES. OTHER STRUCTURES ON YOUR PROPERTY YOUR CONTENTS LIMIT AND YOUR BUILDING CODE UPGRADE COVERAGE. UNDER INSURANCE IS THEREFORE CREATING SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ON HOMEOWNERS ABILITY TO MOVE FORWARD AFTER A MAJOR CATASTROPHE. THE NINE NO ONE REPORT RECOMMENDS A MANDATORY ANNUAL CHECK IN ON COVERAGE LIMITS BY INSURERS WITH THAT WHAT THEIR CUSTOMERS BEFORE RENEWAL OR BEFORE WRITING A NEW HOMEOWNER POLICY WE SUPPORT THIS CONCEPT. AS STEPS TOWARDS ADDRESSING THE AND INSURANCE PROBLEMS IS CRITICAL IT IS ALSO CRITICAL THAT CONSUMERS BE INFORMED OF A CURRENT. REALISTIC ESTIMATES OF THE ACTUAL COST TO REBUILD THEIR HOMES SHOULD THERE FOR US OFFER A TOTAL LOSS. WE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF ALSO BEEN WORKING ON APPROVING pCONTRACTS THAT ARE EASIER TO COMPREHEND WITH GLASS LEGAL JARGON AND WE CONTINUE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN MAKE THIS EASIER FOR THE POLICY HOLDER. MANY OF THAT IS -- GUARANTEED AND REQUIRED BY STATUTE BUT WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TECHNOLOGY CAN HELP WITH A LESSENING THE NUMBER OF PAGES IN A CONTRACT MAKING IT EASIER TO UNDERSTAND. IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY COVERED AND IF YOU WANT TO REFER TO THE CODE SECTION THAT GOVERNS THAT SPECIFIC PIECE OF THE POLICY YOU CAN EITHERCLICK OR WE CAN PROVIDE YOU WITH THAT. ADDENDUM TO YOUR POLICY BUT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE POLICY OLDER CLEARLY UNDERSTANDS WHAT THEY'RE ENTERING INTO WHAT THEIR COVER. FOR THAT THEN THEY CAN MAKE THE APPROPRIATE -- WE CAN MAKE THE APPROPRIATE DECISION FOR THEM AND FOR THEIR FAMILY -- FOR THE FAIR PLAN AND BEFORE THE CALIFORNIA INSURANCE GUARANTEES SO STATION THE FAIR PLAN. IS AS YOU KNOW THE INSURER OF LAST RESORT IN THE STATE AND THE CALIFORNIA SHOWS GUARANTEE ASSOCIATION ISSUES UP THE CLAIMS ARE PAID EVEN IF THE INSURED GOALS AND SOLVE IT. THE FAIR PLAN LIMIT HAS NOT BEEN INCREASED SINCE THE NINETEEN NINETIES AT HOME PRICES IN CALIFORNIA OF CERTAINLY INCREASE SINCE THAT TIME. TO FURTHER COMPLICATE MATTERS THE COVERAGE IS VERY LIMITED -- DWELLING FIRE POLICY WITH LIMITED PERILS AND NO LIABILITY COVERAGE NOT CONSISTENT WITH MOST HOMEOWNERS NEEDS THE CALIFORNIA ASSURANCE GUARANTEE ASSOCIATION LIMIT HAS NOT BEEN INCREASED SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN. NINETEEN SIXTY NINE AND SHOULD BE INCREASED FOR OUR CURRENT LEVELS. OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO IN SUMMARY MORE GENERALLY WE WE SUPPORT THE PORTIONS OF THE REPORT THE FOCUS ON REDUCING FUTURE RISK. THIS INCLUDES INVESTMENTS IN NATURAL FOR STRUCTURE HOME HARDENING AND ESTABLISHING STRONGER RULES ON LAND USE DECISIONS WE NEED REAL PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHEN IT COMES TO REDUCING THAT RISK. AND HAVE MADE SEVERAL AND AND WE'VE HEARD FROM SEVERAL COUNTIES IN THE WORLD AND URBAN INTERFACE WANT TO WORK TOGETHER WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO FIND CREATIVE SOLUTIONS. FOR THE RESIDENTS CAN FIND AND RETAIN INSURANCE THAT THEY NEED TO STATE TO DO THAT WE MUST HAVE A SHARED EFFORT AND HARDING IS THIS EXISTING HOMES. AND MAKE DATA DRIVEN DECISIONS ABOUT NEW DEVELOPMENT -- IN ASKING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DEVELOPERS AND HOMEOWNERS IN THE WORLD AND URBAN INTERFACE TO DO THEIR PART WE ALSO NEED TO ASK INSURERS TO DO THEIR PART AS WELL. MANY POLICY MET AND MANY POLICY CHOICES -- WILL BE -- WILL NEED. TO YOU KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO MAKE TOGETHER THEY WILL ULTIMATELY ALSO BE TOUGH DECISIONS TO MAKE THAT COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE PRICE OF INSURANCE -- WELL WE ALL WANT TO DO AS MUCH AS WE CAN TO MAKE INSURANCE AVAILABLE THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE RECOGNIZE THATTHE AREAS OF HIGH RISK WILL HAVE HIGHER PREMIUMS. EVEN IF THE HOMES ARE HARD AND IN THE LAST TWO YEARS ALONE INSURANCE CARRIERS HAVE SUBMITTED OVER A HUNDRED APPLICATIONS TO OUR DEPARTMENT REQUESTING RATE INCREASES FOR HOME OWNERS INSURANCE. THIS IS MORE THAN DOUBLE THE FILINGS FROM THE PREVIOUS TWO YEARS AND PRESCRIBE AND AND AS PRESCRIBER Là IN ENSURING THAT THE RATES ARE ACTUALLY SOUND WE HAVE MADE UP -- WE HAVE APPROVED THOSE FILINGS WHERE TEACHERS HAVE SUPPORTED THE PROJECTIONS -- FOR FUTURE LOST WHAT WE MAKE THOSE TOUGH DECISIONS I AM HOPEFUL THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO STRIKE A BALANCE. THAT -- WILL ALSO DISTANCE TO BE SAFE HAVE INSURANCE COVERAGE AND REMAIN IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN THEIR HOMES FOR DECADES. THE DEPARTMENT AGREES WITH THE SEVERAL THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE INSURANCE CHAPTER. AND I KEEP BY COMMON SHORT TO NOT REINSTATE WHAT IS ALREADY IN THE REPORT. BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ANY CLOSE BY REITERATING THAT UPFRONT INVESTMENTS IN PREVENTION AND MITIGATION RESILIENCE WILL REDUCE FUTURE REST. AND BENEFIT TO HOMEOWNERS COMMUNITIES INDUSTRY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND OUR STATE WE JUST CANNOT RESPOND AFTER AN AFTERMATH WE HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO BE MUCH MORE PROACTIVE. THANK YOU. ASK FOR QUESTIONS I DID WANT TO THANK ALL THE MEMBERS -- FOR BEING HERE TODAY WE DID HAVE SENATOR RUBIO WHO WAS AT A FUNERAL THIS AFTERNOON THAT. COULD NOT BE WITH US WATER MAKE SURE -- TO WE SHOULD ALL RIGHT WITH THAT WAS SO NOTED -- SO WITH THAT SAID -- MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH SHERMAN DINO WANNA TAKE A MOMENT TO THANK YOU THE CHAIR -- FOR HIS WORK NOT JUST OVER THE PAST MANY BANDS BUT FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS ON THIS. IMPORTANT ISSUE IN GRATEFUL FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS AS WELL AND I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE OUR INSURANCE COMMISSIONER WHO IS HIT THE GROUND RUNNING -- COMING INTO THIS NEW ROLE IN BEING ACTIVE ENGAGE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN RAVAGED BY THESE WHILE AND FIRES AND JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR HARD WORK SIR NO THERE'S A LOT OF WORK AHEAD -- AND THEN ALSO THIS IS TALK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE SEEING ON THE GROUND -- pARE REELING -- IN THEIR REAL IN BECAUSE THEY CAN ACCESS OUR TRADITIONAL INSURANCE. AT SAID THEY HAVE. BEEN HIT BY A COMMITTEES BEEN HIT BY WHILE IN FIRES. AND EVEN IF THEY LIVE MILES AWAY OR LIVING IN THE CORPORATE COMMUNITY IN A COUNTY THERE'S BEEN HIT BY WILDFIRES THEY CAN ACCESS TRADITIONAL INSURANCE. AND EVENTUALLY THIS IS GOING TO IMPACT ECONOMY OF THIS GREAT STATE. END UP WILD -- I AM SO GRATEFUL. FOR THE COMMISSIONER TALKING ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA FAIR PLAN I THINK IT LEASE IN THE REPORT HAVE SOME CONCERNS -- AND I KNOW THAT -- THE COMMISSION IS CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE. A FEW ITEMS IS IF YOU LIVE IN MENDOCINO COUNTY IT'S AN ITEM THAT I MENTIONED LAST TIME. MENDOCINO COUNTY AND NOT EVEN NEAR A WHILE IN FIRE. TRADITIONALLY WERE PAYING NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR YOUR HOME OR POLICY. FIFTEEN SEVENTEEN HER SQUARE FOOT HOME YOU KNOW PAIN. TWENTY ONE THOUSAND A YEAR. BUT YOU'RE SIMPLY PRICING FOLKS OUT. THERE ARE ENTIRE COMMUNITIES IN COUNTIES THAT. HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY WHILE THE FIRE THEY CAN'T GO TO A TRADITIONAL INSURANCE CARRIER. SO THERE I HAVEN'T BEEN A TURN TO THE FAIR PLAN AND THEN GET IN OUT OF STATE WRITER TO TRY TO BE ABLE TO COVER. THEIR HOME WHICH IS OUR NUMBER ONE ASSET. IN SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE IN THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE COMING FORWARD. WOULD BE THAT -- ONLY ALONE FUNDING SUBSIDY TO HOMEOWNERS WHO CURRENTLY LIVE IN HIGH RISK AREAS -- IN CURRENTLY INSURED BY THE FAIR PLAYING -- CONCERN WITH THAT IS. WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU SELL YOUR HOME -- AND WE NEED TO CONTINUE THAT A FAIR PLAYING ON AND COMPLETELY AGREE WITH INSURANCE COMMISSIONER WE NEED TO MAKE IT MORE ROBUST AND LOOK AT HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE. TO PUT ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN THAT -- ANY OTHER CONCERNS -- THAT I KNOW THAT THE CHAIR IS ALSO WORKING ON IS -- IN THE REPORT SHOULD BE AN UNAVAILABLE TO HOMEOWNERS WHO MOVING TO HIGH RISK AREAS IN THE FUTURE WELL. LET'S BE HONEST IF I HAVE A HOME AND I PUT MY LIFE SAVINGS INTO THAT HOME. AND I NEED TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE MY AILING WIFE FOR HUSBAND -- I'M GONNA HAVE TO SELL THAT HOME WHY CAN'T SELL MY HOME IF I CAN'T GET THAT NEXT HOMEOWNERS CAN BE TO GET INSURANCE. I'M OR A BAREBONE INSURANCE AT THE FAIR PLAN AS WELL SO. YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THEY THE COMMISSION IS CURRENTLY WORKING ON AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR THAT. VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE HOME FIRE RISK EDUCTION IN COMMUTER RESTRICTION HOME HARDENING. I ESPECIALLY THE TUBS FIRE THAT AS SENATOR DODD NICE OFFER STAND CENTER JACKSON IS SEEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN IN HER DISTRICT IN EVEN WITH THOSE ENHANCE SOME MORNING CENTERS THAT WE HAVE NOW. I THINK WE NEED TO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND. IN IF FOLKS TO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND. LOVE THAT WORD TAKE A LOOK AT THE OLORADO MODEL BECAUSE AT THAT WILL WORK IN EACH SIDE IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE ABLE TO GIVE. HOMEOWNERS ARE GONNA HAVE TO BE A BECOME MORE ROBUST IN HOME HARDENING INSURANCE CARRIERS AND TO BECOME OPEN TO COVERING -- AND THE THE ISSUE IN REGARD TO NON RENEWALS. FORTY FIVE DAYS IS COMPLETE B. S.. I AND IT HURTS A FAMILY IN CRISIS -- I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE CONDITIONS IT WITHIN THIS BUT WE NEED AT LEAST GIVE A YEAR TO BE A PROVIDE THE OPTION. TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BE -- TO COVER THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES -- AND I APPRECIATE. THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER UP ON THAT IS WELL I HAVE SEVERAL OTHER ITEMS BUT I'LL LEAVE IT THERE BUT AGAIN. THE CHAIR TO THE TRANSMISSION THANK YOU AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO -- AND INSURING THAT FOLKS ARE GOING TO BE A TO STAY IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY LOVE -- IN THE STATE THEY LIVE IN [inaudible] CENTER STERN [inaudible] FAMOUS CHAIR -- THANK YOU MISTER COMMISSIONER FOR SHOWING UP. BRING YOUR STAFF AND DOING THE HARD WORK I MEAN. C. ENGAGEMENT IS COMPLEX AND CRITICAL BUT THE THE COMMUNITY APPRECIATES YOUR PRESENCE AND YOUR DEPARTMENT BEING OUT THERE WORKING THROUGH THE COMPLEXITY IN SOME OF THESE GAPS WERE SEEING IN THESE COMPLEX HERE AND HAVING A FAIR PLAN AND NOT KNOWING. YOU KNOW YOU YOU'RE YOU'RE DISPARITY IN COVERAGE IN. ALL THE NITTY GRITTY OF DEALING WITH THE EXISTING CHALLENGES I WANTED TO GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY COMMENT -- A LITTLE FURTHER ON THIS HOME HARDENING QUESTION ANOTHER SOME -- A FEW ALTERNATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE COMMISSION PUT FORWARD -- LOOKING AT SORT OF A TIERED MITIGATION CREDIT APPROACH. VERSES A STANDARDS BASED APPROACH AND THEN THERE'S ALSO TALK ABOUT. A FUND -- WHICH WE CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE ANY SORT OF HOME HARDENING FUN THERE'S NO SORT OF FORMAL ARCHITECTURE THAT I CAN TELL. IN THE STATE BUDGET OR SO CAN YOU ABSOLUTELY AWAY IN ON THAT SO YOU KNOW THE THE PREMISE ON ALL THE SOLUTIONS ARE BEING DISCUSSED AT THE LEGISLATIVE LEVEL. ALL HAVE TO HAVE SOME SORT OF COMPONENT OF MEDICATION. BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO WITH INVERSE WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO WITH THE FIND AT THE END OF THE DAY SOMEBODY'S GOING TO PAY. FOR THAT RIGHT AND YOU'RE GONNA PAY THROUGH YOUR YOUR INSURANCE POLICY YOU'RE GONNA PAY THROUGH YOUR ENERGY BILL -- AND THE FACT IS THAT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE GET AHEAD OF THIS PROBLEM. AND BY REALLY FOCUSING ON MITIGATION ANY FUND THAT WE CREATE SHOULD HAVE A PERCENTAGE OF THAT GOING TOWARDS MITIGATION BECAUSE THE END OF THE DAY IF WE REDUCE THE RISK. WE GET THE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO ONE STAY AND HOPEFULLY CONTINUE TO WRITE IN THE SENSITIVE AREAS RIGHT. SO THE DEPARTMENT'S VISION IS WHATEVER WE DO IN THE LEGISLATIVE ARENA OR TO THE GOVERNOR IT HAS TO HAVE A MEETING A CLEAR MITIGATION COMPONENT. WITH CLEAR POLICIES NOT ONLY AT THE INDIVIDUAL HOME LEVEL BUT AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL RIGHT BECAUSE IF AND WE SEE THIS TIME AND TIME AGAIN FROM. YOU KNOW MALIBU TO SANTA ROSA THERE ARE FOLKS THAT DID ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING TO MITIGATE BUT THEIR NEIGHBORS DID. RIGHT AND SO THERE'S A MAYBE THAT WOULD HAVE IMPACTED IF WE ALL WOULD HAVE COME TOGETHER AS A COMMUNITY TO HAVE DONE THAT BUT ALSO WHAT ARE THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. TO INITIATE MITIGATION METHODS RIGHT AND AND STRATEGIES WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITY AS NOW YOU KNOW. DO WE HAVE THE THE THE THE PROP THE PROPERTY GRAYSON INGRESS -- SO THAT WE CAN BE ABLE TO ACCESS FOLKS YOU KNOW FOLKS THAT PERISHED IN IN IN PARADISE LITERALLY THERE WAS ONE ROAD IN. AND WE COULD YOU I WAS TOO LATE FOR FOLKS TO TRY TO GET OUT ONCE THE SMOKING MAN. SO OUR APPROACH THE DEPARTMENT IS. WHATEVER SOLUTION WE COME TO IT HAS TO HAVE A MITIGATION APPROACH SO THAT AT AND IT'S GOING TO BE CLEAR AND UNDERSTANDABLE SO THAT WE CAN THEN AT THE DEPARTMENT MEASURE. IF THEY'RE BEING APPROPRIATE WHEN IT COMES TO THAT SO -- THAT IS ESSENTIALLY THE MESSAGE WE I I COME TO BRING IS. WHATEVER WE DECIDE LET'S MAKE SURE THAT IT HAS TO HAVE A ROBUST. MITIGATION COMPONENT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT ALLOWS US TO GET AHEAD OF THE GAME IT ALLOWS US TO THEN MAKE THE THE PAGE FOR THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY THE STATE AND RIGHT IN THESE COMMUNITIES -- AND THEN WE CAN DEMONSTRATE JUST AS WE'RE DEMONSTRATING AND AND IN THIS COLORADO EXAMPLE IS IF IT'S DONE IN A WAY THAT IT'S COMMUNAL IN THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY. THEN WE CAN GO BACK TO JUST COME TO SAY WELL YOU HAVE TO WRITE THESE IN THESE AREAS RIGHT. SO WHATEVER WE DO I'M SAYING IS WE NEED TO HAVE THAT MEDICATION. I COULDN'T AGREE MORE AND I FEEL IT IS THE ONE AREA WHERE WE MAY BE A LITTLE BIT BEHIND I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT. PRUDENT SEE STAND AS A REVIEW UP FRONT WILDFIRE FUN BUT I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW OF WHETHER CENTER REQUIRE OTHERS HERE WHO OF FOLKS WHO EXPOSE HAVING THEIR POLICIES CANCELED WE'RE GONNA HAVE. TO TO MAKE A PUSH HERE I'M I'M CONCERNED FRANKLY IN THE COUNTIES WHERE WERE YOU KNOW THOSE THOSE TOUGH TO REACH SPACES WHERE YOU NEED. BRUSH CLEARANCE ARE GOING TO PRIVATE LANDS AND PEOPLE SAY NO ANSWER PUSH BACK ON FIRE WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT SORT OF TOUGHER TOOLS TO HELP POPLE GET THAT ACCESS BUT TO YOUR POINT. YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE THOSE STEPS AND PUT IN THE EFFORT AND YOU GET NO CREDIT ON THE BACK AND YOU'RE STILL YOU'RE STILL NOT GONNA BE ENSURE YOUR UNDER INSURED. YOU KNOW PEOPLE WENT THROUGH ALL THAT HEADACHE FOR NOTHING SO WILL AND SO ON AND IF WE GET TO A POINT WHERE WHERE WERE. WE YOU KNOW WE'VE MANDATE INSURANCE OBVIOUSLY BEFORE WHEN WE TALKED YOU KNOW GOOD DRIVERS. WERE REASONABLE DRIVER YOU'LL NEED TO PROVIDE INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THEM BUT AGAIN THE FACT IS THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THE THE THE MITIGATION PART THE RESILIENCY PART BECAUSE NO MATTER WHAT IT'S GOING TO COST US OF IF THAT COMMUTE DOES NOT. MITIGATE AND WE MANDATE THAT INSURANCE THE RATES ARE GOING TO BE TO THE POINT WHERE PEOPLE CAN AFFORD THEM ANYWAYS RIGHT. SO AGAIN NOT THAT IT'S A SILVER BULLET BUT I THINK IT IS REALLY KEY TO WHATEVER WE MAKE IS THAT HOW DO WE GET AHEAD OF THE GAME. HOW DO WE THEN HAVE THE TOUGH CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS? ABOUT WHAT ARE. MITIGATION EFFORTS THAT NEED TO BE MADE ONCE YOU REBUILD AND BY THE WAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- NOT GETTING THAN I FROM ENOUGH MONEY TO BE ABLE TO REBUILD THIS IS WHY THE COVERAGE A PART OF YOUR POLICY SO CRITICAL OF ITS. UP TO DATE. THEN YOU KNOW YOU GET THE 10% PIECE SO THAT IT ALLOWS YOU TO BE ABLE TO PAY FOR THOSE UPGRADES THOSE -- THAT WITH THAT ARE MANDATED BY THE STATE AND BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. SO WHY WE WE AGREE WITH THE COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATION THAT THERE SHOULD BE A REGULAR VISITS. SO THAT WE CAN LET THE CONSUMER KNOW HEY ARE YOU UP TO DATE ON YOUR COVERAGE BECAUSE THAT GIVES YOU THAT 10% THAT YOU NEED. TO BE ABLE TO PAY AND IF YOU'RE UP TO DATE. GIVES YOU THE MONEY TO BE ABLE TO THE ID'S BEAR THE THOUGH THE BRUNT. OF THE MITIGATION EFFORTS OF THE STANDARDS AND AND COLD YOU NEED TO UP. BILL TO NOW THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT -- CENTER HILL THEN CENTER WILL CASKEY AND THEN CENTER JACKSON [inaudible] YOUR AND THE DRAFT COMMISSION REPORT CALLED ON FOR DISABILITY UTILITIES THE THE THE COMMUNITY AND FIND THE WILD HEALTHCARE FUNDS. IN ACCORDANCE IS TO MAINTAIN THE SPECIFIED LEVEL OF COMMERCIAL. WILDFIRE LIABILITY GENERAL LIABILITY ISURANCE IN ORDER TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT FUND THE COMMISSION. DOES THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE TODAY TRACK UTILITY INSURANCE PURCHASES AT ALL. NO THAT IS UNDER THE PC PC IS TRUE ON THE INSURANCE OR DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU SHOULD PAY ATTENTION -- WE HAVE SOME. ABSOLUTELY FACTOR THAT WE WOULD NEED THE RESOURCES OBVIOUSLY TO BE ABLE. TO TO TO DO THIS BUT WE FEEL THAT WE WOULD ALSO BE AN APPROPRIATE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO LOOK NOT ONLY AT THE INSURANCE THESE BUT THE RE INSURANCE NEEDS RIGHT OF UTILITIES. AFTER THAT FALLS UNDER THE THE CPC RIGHT THANK YOU. THE CENTER WILL CASKEY. I I GUESS I NEED A LITTLE CLARIFICATION I'M ON PAGE THREE OF THE REPORT AND I'M TO THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE RAISED BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE NORTH COAST. IT SAYS THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF HOME INSURANCE IF INDICATE ADMITTED CARRIERS THEN THEY SAY ANOTHER 1%. IS FROM THIS -- SURPLUS LINES AND WE ONLY HAVE THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THE FAIR PLAN. SO IS IT THE CONSUMER THE JUST THE SIZE THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE INSURANCE OR IS THERE. IS IT THE INSURER. YOU KNOW IF THE IT SEEMS LIKE THEY'VE GOT THESE THREE ALTERNATIVES SAY THE MARKET THE SURPLUS LINES IN THE FAIR PLAN -- BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE HAVE UNINSURED SO THAT'S A THAT'S A PERSON WHO OWNS A HOUSE MAYBE WITH THEIR LIFE SAVINGS SAVINGS THAT SAY THEY'RE GONNA GO NAKED SO I'M WONDER. IS I I WANT TO MAKE IT AFFORDABLE AND AND DO THAT BUT IS IT THAT BIG OF A PROBLEM I GUESS IN YOUR WELL YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S BEEN CHANGING ESPECIALLY AFTER LAST YEAR -- WE WE ARE SEEING AN UPTICK -- OF FOLKS UTILIZING THE ACTUAL FAIR PLAN -- AGAIN WE DON'T FEEL IT'S IT YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY THE FUTURE OF LAST RESORT. BUT IN TERMS OF PEOPLE GOING WITHOUT INSURANCE I MEAN HE YOU NEED THE INSURANCE TO BE A BIT OF THE OUT TO TAKE THE HOME OUT SO -- I DON'T I DON'T I MEAN I BY THE WAY LET ME I FORGOT TO INTRODUCE JILL ARCHER MY AS A SPECIAL DEPUTY -- IN THE DEPARTMENT WHO'S BEEN HELPING ME DEAL WITH A LOT OF THESE ISSUES I DIDN'T A GUEST THERE'S A PHENOMENA THAT GOES ON IS WHEN YOU HAVE A MORTGAGE YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO HAVE INSURANCE WHAT HAPPENS IS PEOPLE. PAY OFF THEIR MORTGAGE AND THEN THEY CANCEL THEIR INSURANCE. IN A WHICH IS YOUR RESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOR ESPECIALLY GIVEN CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE INCREASED DANGER I THINK THERE'S JUST THIS EXPECTATION THAT. IN VERSUS GOING TO PAY FOR EVERYTHING AND I'M GONNA BE MADE WHOLE AND THAT NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT THERE THERE ARE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IN THE REPORT. WE DON'T KNOW THE NUMBERS OF UNINSURED. THE PEOPLE WE DO KNOW THAT THE FAIR PLAN WHICH RIGHTS MAY BE CLOSER CLOSER TO A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND HOMES -- CURRENTLY BUT THAT NUMBER HAS BEEN INCREASING DRAMATICALLY IN WILDFIRE AREAS WHILE IT IS GOING DOWN AND URBAN AREAS. SO IT IS A SMALL NUMBER AND THE THE A SURPLUS LINES MIGHT HAVE ONLY HAD TWENTY THOUSAND POLICIES. A YEAR OR TWO AGO AND NOW THEY'RE UP TO SIXTY SEVENTY THOUSAND POLICIES. SO WHILE THE NUMBERS ARE STILL VERY SMALL AND THOSE ARE KIND END OF LAST YEAR. WE THINK THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF A LOT OF COMPLAINTS I'M SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE HEARING. IN MANY DISTRICTS OF PEOPLE BEING NON RENEWED OR HAVING THEIR PREMIUMS. RADICALLY INCREASE SO THOSE ARE KIND OF THEIR JUST SIGNALS. BUT YET AT THIS MOMENT YOU WOULD SAY YES THE MARKET PLACE IS RESPONDING. BUT IF YOU'RE IN SOME OF THESE OUTLYING AREAS OR HIGHER RISK AREAS YOU WOULD SAY THERE'S A CRISIS. IN A A QUESTION ON THE MEDICATION NOT [inaudible] TO NOT TO BEAT. ORGAN BE BETTER HERE BUT THE SENATE VERSION FOR LONG TERM RESILIENCY INVESTMENT ON THE CAP AND TRADE THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WAS NOT. ACCEPTED BY THE ADMINISTRATION NOR WAS THE REGIONAL FOREST RESTORATION PROJECTS THAT WE PUT IN FOR HEALTHY FOREST WAS REJECTED BY THIS ADMINISTRATION BUT WITH THAT SAID -- YOU KNOW THE STATE LACKS THE ABILITY TO PLACE A LIEN ON PEOPLE'S PROPERTY. THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAN DO IT THE CITY CAN DO IT THE WATER DISTRICT CAN DO IT BUT THE STATE DOESN'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY IF WE'RE REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT HARDENING AND HARDENING ASSETS AND TREE REMOVAL FOR THE MEDICATION. WE DON'T HAVE THAT TOOL TO IN FOR SAY WE WILL REMOVE THE TREE AND WE WILL. CHARGE YOU HOMEOWNER AND WE'LL PUT IT ON BECAUSE OUR GUESTS THAT'S ANOTHER TOOL YOU THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT TOOL OR NOT A NECESSARY TOOL WELL I I CAN ONLY SPEAK TOWARDS WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM. AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT FOLKS -- FAIL TO DO THE APPROPRIATE HARDENING ONE BECAUSE THEY JUST CAN'T AFFORD IT. I AND THEY'RE ALREADY PAYING VERY HIGH PREMIUMS -- AND SO WHEN THE DEVASTATION HAPPENS. THE LEAST OF THE CONSIDER TRYING JUST TO GET THE DWELLING BACK AND MANY OF THEM SAY I I CAN'T AFFORD THE THE THE THE UPGRADES. HENCE WHY AGAIN THE COVERAGE A IS CRITICAL BUT I DON'T THINK WE'RE AT A POINT WHERE -- FOR ITS NOT THAT FOLKS ARE JUST NOT WILLING TO DO IT. ONE THERE'S NOT A CLEAR BENCHMARK OF WHAT SHOULD BE DONE. TO HARDEN YOUR HOME IN A IN A GIVEN COMMUNITY COMMUNITIES ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM OBVIOUSLY AS WE KNOW FROM TOWN TO TOWN. AND REGION TO REGION FILTERS IT'S HARDER TO PROVIDE A SET RECOMMENDATION WHY WE THINK YOU KNOW CAL FIRE THE DEPARTMENT AND ALTHOUGH THOSE OF US THAT DO THIS WORK. SHOULD COME TOGETHER TO FIGURE OUT FOR THE COMMUNITY A WHAT WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE. MITIGATION MEASURES AND HARDENING MEASURES FOR THAT COMMUNITY SO THAT THEN WE COULD PUT THAT INTO -- AWAIT THAT'S EASY FOR THEM TO UNDERSTAND SO WE KNOW CLEARLY WHAT THE TO DO COMMUNITY BE YOU NEED TO DO THIS. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO YOU SEE TO RAIN TOPOGRAPHY EVERYTHING'S DIFFERENT IN THE STATE AND THE NEEDS ARE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT RIGHT NOW COMMUNITIES -- YOU KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT SOME STANDARDS ARE BUT YOU REALLY IN TERMS OF A COMMUNAL. ASPECT WE DON'T HAVE A FRAMEWORK OF WHAT PEOPLE SHOULD FOLLOW IN A REGIONAL ASPECT OF MEDICATION AND AND HARDENING. THERE CENTER JACK. MISSION FOR BEING WITH US AND THANK YOU ALSO TO YOUR STAFF -- I HAPPEN TO HAVE BEEN THE NON RENEWED THIS YEAR AS A RESULT OF THE THOMAS FIRE HAVING SPENT THIRTY YEARS WITH THE SAME INSURANCE COMPANY -- THEY JUST SIMPLY T RISK IN THIS AREA BY. WE'RE WE'RE LEAVING -- AND THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO RE RENEW HAVING DONE ALL THE THE MITIGATION STEPS IS EXTRAORDINARY AND SO. I WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED IF THERE ARE SOME THINGS WE CAN DO -- THAT WILL -- PUT PRESSURE ON THE INSURANCE COMPANIES IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE TAKEN ALL THE NECESSARY STEPS AND YOU JUST HAPPEN TO LIVE IN THE WILL WEAK. AND YOU'VE DONE HARDENING OF YOUR HOME YOU'VE TAKEN ALL ALL MEASURES THAT ARE AVAILABLE -- IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO LEGISLATIVELY TO REQUIRE THE INSURANCE COMPANIES MAN I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIRTY YEARS OF PREMIUMS ARE BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU IT'S A LOT MORE THAN WE'VE GOTTEN. BACK -- ALTHOUGH OF BECAUSE WE DID HAVE CLOSE TO ADEQUATE INSURANCE ALTHOUGH PROBABLY NOT WHEN WE WERE -- OF FORCED TO TO VACATE OUR HOME. WE WERE COMPENSATED WHEN WE ST ELSEWHERE DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME THESE ARE THE SMALL THINGS THAT ACTUALLY ATTENDED THEY CAN BE VERY IMPORTANT. BUT I'M WONDERING. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT. WE CAN DO LEGISLATIVELY TO HELP YOU WHEN YOU GET THESE COMPANIES WHO DON'T WANT TO WRITE ANYMORE INSURANCE OUR A IF YOU'VE DONE ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE -- BECAUSE FRANKLY GOING OUT AND TRYING TO FIND NEW INSURANCE -- IS FOR HER EXPENSIVE BOTH THE PROCESS AND AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU CAN AS SOMEONE MENTIONED GET -- SOME INADEQUATE INSURANCE LOCALLY AND THEN YOU HAVE TO GO OUT OF STATE THEIR PEOPLE ALWAYS WILLING TO WRITE INSURANCE. BUT WITHIN OUR OWN STATE WHAT CAN WE DO. TO BRING OUR OWN COMPANIES TO THE TABLE MORE EFFECTIVELY AND IS THERE A TOOL OR THEIR TOOLS THAT WE CAN BE LOOKING AT THE WE DON'T HAVE NOW THAT WILL. REQUIRE THEY INSURE YOU I MEAN IF YOU DON'T OWN YOUR HOME. ONE OF THE CONDITIONS YOU'RE MENTIONING IS TO GET A MORTGAGE YOU NEED TO HAVE INSURANCE SICKLY THE LENDER WANTS TO BE SURE THEY'RE GOING TO BE COMPENSATED. IF YOU LOSE THE HOME YOU DON'T HAVE INSURANCE THEY FOR CLOSING THE MORE MORTGAGE YOU DO YOU LEAVE. YOUR GONE SO WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH LACK OF HOUSING WHEN PEOPLE LOSE THEIR HOMES THROUGH THESE KINDS OF CONDITIONS. WHAT IF ANYTHING CAN WE DO A LEGISLATIVELY TO PROTECT AGAINST ACTUALLY WHAT THE DISCUSSIONS AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER WERE -- IF YOU DO THE APPROPRIATE HARDENING THAT WE WOULD REQUIRE YOU. TO PROVIDE INSURANCE FOR THOSE HOMES IS THAT THE LONG HOURS SAID SOMETHING WILL HAVE TO DO SOMETHING THAT WERE THAT IT'S THE PART OF THE RECOMMENDATION THAT WE WORK WITH WE WORK WITH -- THAT I KNOW ONE COMMISSION. BUT AGAIN NOW WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT CLEAR. EVIDENTIARY DATA DRIVEN STANDARDS THAT ARE GOING TO GET US TO A POINT WHERE WE CAN PROVE THAT THESE TECHNIQUES ARE GOING OUT. I ACTUALLY GONNA HELP ENOUGH FIRE SITUATION OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THIS THE ISSUES LIKE PARADISE WHERE. THEY'RE JUST DEVASTATING AND YOU KNOW THE CONTROLLING OF THAT IS VERY UNIQUE -- BUT THOSE ARE PART OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE ARE SUPPORTING. THAT IF YOU DO EVERY IT ONCE WE COME UP WITH EXACTLY WHAT WE FEEL IS APPROPRIATE FOR YOU TO HARD IN YOUR HOME. GIVEN THE COMMUNITY THAT YOU LIVE IN. YOUR LIVING AND THAT YOU SHOULD BE. INTEREST COVERAGE SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO OFFER A POLICY YOU SHOW -- THAT I ASSUME THEN THAT YOU'RE SUPPORTING MY SP ONE EIGHTY TWO WHICH ACTUALLY DOES ADDED. TO IT -- REQUIRES HEIGHTENED COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. IN PLANNING STANDARDS -- IT ALSO REQUIRES RETROFIT PLANS IN THOSE HOMES THAT ALREADY BUILT IN THESE AREAS I'M ASSUMING THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS. THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AND IT ALSO A BETTER COMMUNITY ALERT STANDARDS FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES ALL OF THE THINGS WERE THOSE AND OTHER THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AS FOR CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE STRIKE FORCE AND SO. ARE WE GETTING ANY -- POSITIVE RESPONSE FROM THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY ON THIS OR THEY RESISTING THE NOTION OF US GOD FOR BID TELLING THEM WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO TO CONTINUE DOING BUSINESS AND MAKING LOTS OF MONEY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THE ARMY WERE THERE THE PART OF THE DISCUSSIONS WE'VE MET WITH THE INDUSTRY TWICE NOW -- THERE HAS BEEN VERY FRUITFUL DISCUSSIONS IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW WHAT. ARE THE OBLIGATIONS THAT WE ARE EXPECTING OF OF COVERAGE OF PEOPLE TO DO THE RIGHT THING -- BUT ALSO YOU KNOW. WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW THAT IMPACTS ULTIMATELY -- THE HOMEOWNER IF WE REQUIRE IN FORCE -- AN INSURANCE PRODUCT THEN IF IT'S NOT AFFORDABLE HYDRO. WE'RE STILL BACK AT SQUARE ZERO ALL RIGHT SO HOW DO WE THEN FIGURE OUT -- A BALANCE OF WHAT IS A OF MITIGATION EFFORT WAS A HEARTENING THAT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE GOING TO SEE THROUGH DATA AT STRIVE AND THAT SAYS. THIS CAN ACTUALLY PROTECT YOU AND FURTHER MORE IF THE COMMUNITY THEN ENGAGES AND THE CITY EITHER ON A REGIONAL LEVEL. THAT GIVE THE INSURER -- OF A BETTER IDEA OF THE FACT THAT IT'S NOT JUST. YOU KNOW PARTIAL BY PARCEL THAT IT'S ACTUALLY ENTIRE COMMUNITY THAT COULD BE INSURABLE AND MAYBE DRAW AT RISK A LITTLE DOWN WHICH WILL HOPEFULLY BRING THE PREMIUMS DOWN SO I KNOW FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE OUR LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT COMES OUT AND THEY DO AN INSPECTION THEY GIVE YOU NOTICE. IF YOU DON'T CLEAR OFF X. WARREN SEE THEY'LL DO IT FOR YOU. THEY DON'T NECESSARILY DO A WEALTH BUT THEY WILL CLEAR THE AREA AND IS THIS THE KIND OF THING YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT PROACTIVE APPROACH RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT IN THE DEPARTMENT IS THAT. THERE THERE'D BE A ACCESS TO A FIRE STATION WITHIN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MILES IN THIS IN A GIVEN COMMUNITY OR NEIGHBORHOOD -- THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND WILL BE UNVEILING SHORTLY ONCE YOU KNOW THE THE STRIKE FOR SYSTEM HAVING CONVERSATIONS BUT THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT EXACTLY WE'RE LOOKING AT VERY THANK YOU. OKAY THE LAST -- WERE OVER. OKAY SIR MORE LUCK THAN CENTER HUESO AND HE WILL BE THE LAST WORD. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN COMMISSIONERS LARA -- WHEN A INSURANCE COMPANY THAT'S NOT WITHIN CALIFORNIA OR MAYBE WITHIN CALIFORNIA WANTS TO SELL HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE THEY HAVE TO REGISTER THROUGH YOUR DEPARTMENT IS THAT CORRECT CORRECT? AND SO IF THEY WANT TO DISENGAGE AND SELLING INSURANCE WITH THEY HAVE. TO ON REGISTER OR REQUEST TO BE TERMINATOR. REMOVED FROM THE MARKET PLACE THEY AN AND FOR CAN WITHDRAW FORMALLY FROM A LINE OF BUSINESS THEY WOULD FILE FROM THE DIP. WITH THE DEPARTMENT BUT IF THEY WANT TO REDUCE THEIR WRITINGS. TO MAYBE A HIGHER STANDARD OF OR A LOWER AMOUNT OF RISK. BY THEIR UNDERWRITING THEY CAN DO THAT WITHOUT ANY NOTIFICATION. AND SIMPLY THE NOTIFICATION THAT GOES OUT TO THE CUSTOMER. THE CONSUMER ABOUT THE FORTY FIVE DAY NOTICE NON RENEWAL -- SENATOR JACKSON MENTIONED. DESPITE. WHATEVER YOU'VE DONE AT YOUR PROPERTY THEY'VE JUST DECIDED TO RETRENCH. THEY CAN DO THAT UNILATERALLY DISARM THEIR OWN ON THEIR OWN YES AND THEN -- SO THOSE AT THAT HAVE. REQUESTED TO BE REGISTERED ARE YOU KEEP TRACK OF THAT AND AND OR DO WE HAVE A TREND LINE THAT'S GOING A CERTAIN DIRECTION WOULD TRACK THAT BUT I DON'T THINK ANY ANSWER -- HAS FILED TO WITHDRAW FROM THE LINE FROM WRITING HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE OR FIRE INSURANCE. SO WE HAVE NOT SEEN ONE COMPANIES SAY THAT'S ENOUGH FOR LEAVING CALIFORNIA. TO MY KNOWLEDGE THAT IS CORRECT YOU'RE JUST HANGING ONE COMPANY DO THAT THEY'RE JUST SAYING WE WE DON'T WANT TO BE IN SANTA BARBARA ANYMORE. PARTS OF SANTA BARBARA POTENTIAL. AND I I SUSPECT PARTS OF ALL PLACES THERE WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN THE FIRES YEAH YEAH WITH THE THIS IS A UNIVERSAL PROBLEM AND AND THE WE'RE WE'RE SEEING REAL. CHALLENGE BECAUSE THE COSTS OF REINSURER THE COST OF INSURANCE EVEN IF THEY DO RENEW. CAN BE TRIPLE FOUR TIMES FIVE TIMES THE ORIGINAL COST AND FOR PEOPLE ON FIXED INCOMES. THAT BECOMES A BONE CRUSHER THANK THEY CAN'T DO IT SO. YOU KNOW THERE'S OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T WANT THE COMPANIES TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS BUT WE REALLY VERY VULNERABLE NOW AND AND THE THE FAIR PLAN DOES NOT. DOES NOT PROTECT A ADEQUATELY OUR FOR OUR PROPERTY JACKSON JUST AS YOU WERE MENTIONING NOT TO BELIEVE THE POINT BUT IF. WE WE WE WANNA HEALTHY INSURANCE MARKET WE NEED IT IN ORDER TO PAY OUT THE CLAIMS -- AND SO. YOU KNOW AGAIN AS WE HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT FUNDS ABOUT -- DIFFERENT WAYS OF PAYING -- FOR EITHER THE LIABILITY OF THE UTILITIES ARE OR THE HOMEOWNERS. WE OFFER ALSO AFTER SENATE UNDER INSURANCES CONTINUES TO BE A MAJOR POLICIES ARE FOLKS THAT. ARE NOT YET EVEN PAYING FOR WHAT THEY'RE A PROPERLY SHOULD BE COVERED. FOR YET WE'RE HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT. YOU KNOW TAKING ON ADDITIONAL A FEE OR ATTACKS AND AND THAT JUST MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR EVEN MORE DIFFICULT FOR FOLKS. THAT CURRENTLY ARE STILL UNDER INSURED FOR THE PUBLIC THE COUNTY HAVE. SO I'M JUST TRYING TO CONFIRM ANECDOTAL DATA. SO IT'S IT'S NOT THAT THERE IS THERE IS WE DON'T HAVE. A TREND OF COMPANIES LEAVING CALIFORNIA'S THAT'S THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR THE ISSUE IS. THEY'RE GETTING OUT A CERTAIN GEOGRAPHICAL ZONES OR MAYBE THEY'RE ASKING A MUCH HIGHER PREMIUM CORRECT SO -- AND IT IN FOLLOWING UP WITH WHAT YOU JUST SAID YOU KNOW HOW TO YOU KNOW STILL MAKE A GOOD MARKET FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES. WE'VE HAD PROP ONE OF THREE IN PLACE FOR THREE DECADES NOW. IS THE TIME TO LOOK AT MAYBE SOME MODIFICATIONS ARE YOU GETTING PUSHED BACK FROM THE INDUSTRY IS SAYS WHAT IF YOU HAD A MAGIC ONE YOU COULD FIX X. OR Y. OR Z.. THAT WOULD MAKE THE MARKET MORE COMPETITIVE AND MAYBE PREMIUMS LOWER. WELL I MEAN I HAVE YET TO MEET ONE ENSURE WHO DOESN'T. WHO WHO LIKES PROP THIRTY ONE BUT -- I'LL TELL YOU IF IF. THEY WANT TO INCREASE THE RATES THERE'S A PROCESS FOR THAT WITHIN PROP ONE OF THREE WE'RE NOT STOPPING THAT FROM HAPPENING AND ACTUALLY SAID SEVERAL COMPANIES HAVE -- ARE UTILIZING THAT. PUBLIC PROCESS TO BE ABLE TO TO RAISE OUR RATES IT'S JUST A HAS A TENS OF HAVING TO GO THROUGH THIS PUBLIC PROCESS WHICH WE FEEL IS IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN A FOR GUNNERY SOMEBODY'S RATES. BEYOND THE 7% SO THERE IS A PROCESS FOR FOLKS TO RAISE THE RATES CURRENTLY UNDER PROP ONE OF THREE WHICH WE FEEL IS IMPORTANT -- NOW THE THE THE CONVERSATION AROUND -- HOW DO WE CONTINUE A ROBUST MARKET AND HAVING THE YOU KNOW AS WE KNOW THE INSURANCE MARKET IN CALIFORNIA IS THE LARGEST IN THE COUNTRY WHICH GIVES THE FROM THE WAY? BUT WHAT EVER -- YOU KNOW IT'S LITERALLY LIKE A BALLOON WE'VE YOU SQUEEZE ONE WAY IT'S GONNA YOU KNOW IT'S EXPAND AND THE OTHER WAY AND WHO'S GONNA COVER. SOMEBODY'S GONNA ALWAYS PAY AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT AS A DEPARTMENT OURSELVES. HOW DO WE GET AHEAD OF THIS IS THIS IS WHERE WE KEEP GOING BACK TO MITIGATION? BECAUSE OF WE INCENTIVIZE COMMUNITIES TO DO THE RIGHT THING AT A REGIONAL LEVEL. A CREATES A A HOPEFULLY CREATES A A AN ENVIRONMENT BY WHICH THE INSURERS WANNA RIGHT CONTINUE TO WRITE. AND THAT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING RIGHT TO PREVENT FUTURE FIRES. SO I THINK IT GETS. TESTY WHEN YOU START FREAKING OUT WELL THERE'S A CURRENT PROCESS IN PLACE NOW IF YOU WANT TO GO HIGHER WHICH IS. YOU KNOW WE HAVE OUR ACTUARY ILLS WE HAVE OUR ACTUARIES AND EVERYBODY LOOKING AT MAKING SURE OF IT'S JUSTIFIED AND WE'VE BEEN. WE'VE WE'VE HAD TWO OF REYES WE HAVE HAD RAISE RATES BECAUSE IT'S JUSTIFIABLY NEEDED. FOR THIS COMPANY OR THE IN THE MARKET TO CONTINUE TO BE ROBUST -- AND SO YOU KNOW THERE'S GONNA BE PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT GOING TO WANT TO GO TO THE PROCESS BECAUSE CLEARLY THEY DON'T WANT THE PUBLIC. YOU KNOW PROCESS TO INDICATE THAT THE UNION OF RAISE OUR RATES. BUT THERE IS A PROCESS IN PLACE THE BUT THE VOTERS VOTED FOR THIS. TO TO CREATE MORE TRANSPARENCY FOR US -- BUT IT DOESN'T LIMIT YOU DON'T NEED TO AND THE PROCESS RIGHT RIGHT I'M JUST CURIOUS IF THERE WAS SOME. AREA WHERE YOU CAP TIGHT YEAH YOU KNOW THAT'S A LEGITIMATE GRIPE. IN MAYBE WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT IT SO YOU'RE SAYING THERE ISN'T. BUT WHEN YOU ARE THEIR TRENDS THEN OF OF MORE COMPANIES COMING TO YOU FOR RATE INCREASES ABOVE ARE A NUMBER OF RATE FILINGS DOUBLED THE LAST TWO YEARS SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN WERE DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF HOME WONDER RATE INCREASE FILINGS. IN THE TWO PRIOR YEARS AND THOSE HAVE BEEN APPROVED THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN RATE FILINGS FOR INCREASES I HAVE ALL BEEN APPROVED. OKAY SO IT HAS GONE UP. SIX THANK YOU THANK YOU COMMISSIONER THANK YOU MISTER OR HUESO [inaudible] ALL. WELCOME SENATOR AND I ALSO APPLAUD YOUR JUMPING INTO THE THE WEEDS. IMMEDIATELY UPON -- COME IN AND OFFICE OF CONGRADULATIONS ON ON ALL YOUR SUCCESS. AND FOR STEPPING UP TO THIS VERY IMPORTANT TASK BUT JUST FOLLOWING UP WITH WITH THAT I MEAN WAS THAT INCREASE SUPPOSED TO OF A MINUTES INTENDED PURPOSE WAS. TO INJECT SOME -- SOME HEALTH INTO THE INSURANCE MARKET I MEAN IS THAT. YEAH -- RATE INCREASES ARE NGUYEN ANSWERS LOOK AT THEIR PAST LOSS EXPERIENCE AND PROJECT WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO NEED TO CHARGE NEXT YEAR. SO IT IT YOU KNOW A AYE ON ON ACTUARIAL ANALYSIS YES. SO WHEN WHEN I LOOKED AT LETTER THAT WAS SENT BY -- THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY RECALL. REGARDS -- TO THE REPORT -- THERE IS SO. I STRUGGLE TO UNDERSTAND IT BUT THE REASON I'M ASKING QUESTIONS SO TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND OF SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE -- UNDER OF THE REPORTS -- APPENDIX THREE THEY THEY MAY RESPOND TO SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS RECOMMENDATION NUMBER. TWO IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S SHOULD PROVIDE PRESERVE ITS RISK BASED APPROACH TO PRICE IN HOME INSURANCE. AND THEY RESPOND. THAT CALIFORNIA THAT WE SHOULD CHANGE THAT SENT US TO SAY. THE CALIFORNIA SHOULD EMBRACE RISK BRACE PRICE INSURANCE AND SO THE QUESTION I HAVE IS DO WE HAVE. A RISK BASED APPROACH. TWO OF PRICE INSURANCE. YES -- THE RATE INCREASE WHY DID THEY SAY THAT WE DON'T. I THINK THEY WOULD ALWAYS LIKE MORE RATE TO I I GUESS BUT THAT THEY SEGMENT THE RATE SO THAT HIGHER WILD FIRE RISK AREAS. PAY SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PREMIUMS SO THAT'S THE THAT'S WHAT THE END GAME I MEAN -- THEY'RE IDENTIFYING. CALIFORNIA PUTS CAPS IN TERMS OF RATES RIGHT SO THROUGH YOUR OFFICE YOU DECIDE THIS IS WHAT'S. NOT NOT A CAP WHAT'S FAIR PRICE WE WOULD APPROVE WHATEVER IS ACTUALLY PROVEN TO BE THE NECESSARY RATE INCREASE. THEY CAN INCREASE BY AS MUCH AS THEY ARE ABLE TO JUSTIFY ACTUAR AND THEY WOULD BE LIKE TO BE LESS REGULATE IN THAT AREA IS THAT WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS IS ABOUT OKAY. AND AND WITH THAT WOULD IN REGARDS -- TO POLICY LIMITS AND YOU KNOW OTHER OTHER OTHER OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS THEY'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SET THAT. IN TERMS OF AND SAY -- WILL PUT MORE MONEY INTO THIS OF I MEAN THE FAIR PLAN WAS BASICALLY ESTABLISHED BECAUSE WE COULDN'T ENSURE CERTAIN AREAS IS THAT A LACK OF INSURANCE IN THOSE AREAS SET BY THE FACT THAT WE WE TRY TO REGULATE. WHAT THE INSURANCE COMPANY KNOWS THE FAIR PLAN WHEN IT WENT INTO EFFECT WILL LONG BEFORE PROPOSITION ONE OF? THREE AND ARGUABLY WERE IN NOW THEY WERE HIGH RISK AREAS BUT ALSO AREAS THAT INSURERS SIMPLY CHOSE NOT TO WRITE. URBAN AREAS THAT THEY DID NOT KNOW RIGHT. URBAN AREAS THAT HAVE MAYBE LOW INCOME I KNOW I WAS RAISED IN A CALIFORNIA FOR THE FAIR PLAN NEIGHBORHOODS SO I KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. BUT THE THE OTHER QUESTION IS REGARDING THE FAIR PLAN. AND STRENGTHENED UNIT -- THERE'S ALSO THEY MAKE A CASE FOR SUBSIDIZED IN THE FOR PLAN AS A FOR PLAN EVER BEEN SUBSIDIZED DOES IT REQUIRE SUBSIDY. AND IS IT UNDER FUNDED. OF I THINK WHEN THE A FAIR PLAN WAS INITIALLY CREATED IN SIR -- IS MADE A CONTRIBUTION. TWO OF FUNDED. THEY ACTUALLY HAVE RECEIVED -- DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THE FAIR PLAN OF PROFITS IN RECENT YEARS. HOWEVER I THE FAIR PLAN DID SUFFER SIGNIFICANT LOSSES IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY'VE HAD TO DO AN ASSESSMENT. BUT THE INSURERS ARE THE BACKSTOP IF THE FAIR PLAN WERE TO GO THROUGH ITS CAPITAL AND REINSURANCE. THANK. THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH COMMISSIONER THANK YOU THANK YOU NUMBERS WE SHOULD BE A THANK YOU. HE NOW OUR FINAL -- PANELISTS IS PROFESSOR MICHAEL LARA THIS WAR WILL DISCUSS ISSUES CONCERNING COST RECOVERY AS WELL AS FIND CONCEPTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PERTAINING. THE PAYMENT WHILE FAR RELATED CLAIMS WELL I WELCOME YOU -- PROFESSOR LAURA I APOLOGIZE FOR THE SECOND TIME IN A ROW YOU'RE THE LAST ONE ON THE YOU KNOW ON THE ORDER. IT'S CERTAINLY NOT THAT THAT IS -- THE LEAST IMPORTANT BECAUSE ALL THESE ISSUES ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR GREAT WORK FOR BEING HERE. ALL. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME -- AND I APOLOGIZE BUT CITY BETWEEN YOU AND A BIRTHDAY DINNER -- ORDERED OUT OF THE I'M IN A I'M IN A SPEECH TODAY -- PRIMARILY ABOUT THE SUB CHAPTER THAT -- CHAIR PETERMAN AND I WORKED ON TOGETHER -- BUT BEFORE I DO THAT I WANT TO JUST SECOND SOMETHING THAT BOTH -- CHAIR PETER MEN AND COMMISSIONER LARA HAVE EMPHASIZED AND I THINK THIS REALLY CAME OUT OF ALL THE TESTIMONY THAT WE HEARD. THE IMPORTANCE OF FULLY FUNDING AN INTENSIVE MEDICATION EFFORT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I THINK CANNOT BE OVERSTATED -- WE ARE CONTEMPLATING MULTI BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENTS -- IN TERMS OF SOCIALIZING COSTS. AND I THINK THE THE WORK THAT THE DAY NINE A ONE COMMITTEE DID LAST YEAR TO REALLY RAMP UP OUR INVESTMENT AND WHILE FOR MEDICATION IS IS ADMIRABLE AND WE NEED TO KEEP GOING FURTHER THAN THAT. THERE'S SO MUCH TO BE DONE AND THERE THE PAYOFF TO MITIGATION IS NOT SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF SIX TO ONE AND SO. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT OPPORTUNITIES TO FOR INVESTMENT -- LOOKING AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL. AND IN TERMS OF FUELS MANAGEMENT AND FUEL LOAD -- AND ALSO. AT THE INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNER LEVEL IN TERMS OF HOME HARDENING AND DEFENSIBLE SPACE -- CHAU. I AM GONNA FOCUS BRIEFLY AND THEN -- HOPEFULLY LEAVE TIME FOR QUESTIONS ON OUR DISCUSSION THE OF A WILDFIRE FUND. AS AN OPTION AND ASSOCIATED. ASPECTS OF COST RECOVERY -- OUR COMMISSION -- ULTIMATELY RECOMMENDED THE CREATION OF WHAT WE CALL -- A WILDFIRE VICTIMS FUND [inaudible] AND I THINK THE BEST WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL IS AS SORT OF A SECOND INSURANCE POLICY [inaudible] FOR UTILITIES. THE CURRENT UTILITY LIABILITY COVERAGE IS ON THE ORDER OF A BILLION TO BILLION HALF DOLLARS THAT'S REALLY LIMITED BY CAPACITY IN GLOBAL MARKETS IN YOU KNOW WILLINGNESS TO INSURE. CALIFORNIA WILDFIRE RISK BELIEVE IT OR NOT IS PRETTY LIMITED AT THIS POINT. AND UTILITY STRUGGLE TO OBTAIN INSURANCE IS TO GIVE YOU A SENSE THAT INSURANCE TYPICALLY COSTS -- THIRTY CENTS ON THE DOLLAR SO TO COVER A BILLION DOLLARS RIGHT NOW UTILITIES HAVE TO PAY ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. SO IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE INSURANCE THINK ABOUT IF YOUR HOMEOWNER'S POLICIES COST THAT MUCH RIGHT -- SO. THE VICTIMS FIND WOULD SERVE AS KIND OF A SECONDARY INSURANCE POLICY IN A THE GOAL OF FAT IS REALLY TO PROTECT RATE PAYERS FROM WILDFIRE COSTS. AND TO CREATE GREATER CERTAINTY FOR VICTIMS THAT THEY WILL ACTUALLY GET PAID RATHER THAN SEEING THEIR CLAIMS SETTLED AND AND NOT PAID BECAUSE THE COMPANY ENTERED BANKRUPTCY OR DISCHARGED IN BANKRUPTCY AND PAID AT A MUCH DISCOUNTED RATE -- THERE ENORMOUS CHALLENGES -- TO EXECUTING ON THIS KIND OF A POLICY AND WE ARE. CLEAR ABOUT THEM IN THE REPORT AND I RECOMMEND THAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE POLICY PROPOSAL BUT ALSO READ OUR OUR DISCUSSION OF THE CHALLENGES AND I THINK THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE IS REALLY INVOLVED -- THEY NEED TO GET CONTRIBUTION [inaudible] SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTION REALLY SHARED SACRIFICE -- FROM UTILITIES POTENTIALLY FROM OTHER PARTIES -- THERE ARE THERE IS PERHAPS SOME CLARITY ABOUT HOW AND IF THERE IS SOME SORT OF A FIND HOW RATE PAYERS MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO THAT. BY EXTENSION OF THE CURRENTLY -- IN FOR STATE IF YOU ARE BOND CHARGE -- THERE'S MUCH LESS CLARITY ABOUT HOW OTHER ACTORS THAT ARE. ACCOUNTABLE AND SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND SHOULD SHARE IN THE COSTS OF THE DRAMATIC INCREASE RISKS THAT THE STATE IS CONFRONTING. SHOULD CONTRIBUTE AND THAT'S A THAT'S A KEY CHALLENGE SECONDARY CHALLENGER JUST MENTION BY. ARCHER PETERMAN IS THE ISSUE OF HOW. A COMPANY THAT IS IN BANKRUPTCY COULD CONTRIBUTE. TO FIND AND THEREFORE JOIN THE FUND. OBVIOUSLY THAT'S A BIG QUESTION FOR P. JEANNIE BUT I THINK THAT THERE ARE CREATIVE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE POSSIBLE. IF THERE IS LEADERSHIP SHOWN BY THE STATE A DIRECTION CHARTED BY THE STATE I THINK THERE'S THERE ARE POSSIBILITIES FOR OVERCOMING MATCH CHALLENGES WHILE -- I WOULD EMPHASIZE THAT. THIS KIND OF A PROPOSAL ALLOWS FOR RULES THAT WOULD REQUIRE. RE CAPITALIZATION TO THE FIND IF AND WHEN UTILITIES ARE IMPRUDENT OR NEGLIGENT. IN THERE ARE EITHER CONSTRUCTION MAINTENANCE OR OPERATION OF THEIR SYSTEM IF UTILITIES DO BAD THINGS THERE'S NO REASON THAT A FUNDS COULDN'T REQUIRE THEM. TO TO READ -- REPAY THE FUND FOR SOME FRACTION OF THE LOSSES -- THE BENEFIT OF THIS SORT OF A FIND IS THAT IT WOULD ALLOW AS I SAID -- PROVIDE ESSENTIALLY LIKE A MOAT BETWEEN WILDFIRE COSTS AND RATE PAYERS THAT ARE ALREADY BURDENS. IT WOULD ALSO CREATE GREATER CERTAINTY THAT HE VICTIMS WILL ACTUALLY GET PAID AND GET PAID HOPEFULLY AT FASTER AND MORE TIMELY FASHION -- IT WOULD ALSO. INCREASE THE SOLVENCY AND REDUCE THE BANKRUPTCY RISK FOR THE UTILITIES WHICH HAS A SECONDARY IMPACT ON RATE PAYERS IN TERMS OF LOWER -- BORROWING COSTS ACOSTA CAPITAL GENERALLY FOR UTILITIES THE I. O. U.'S HAVE RECENTLY ASKED FOR A SIX HUNDRED BASIS POINT INCREASE. IN THEIR COST OF CAPITAL THAT IS -- TO PUT IT MILDLY EXTRAORDINARY -- AND ON AFFORDABLE FOR THE STATE I MEAN IT'S A SIMPLE AS THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO MAINTAIN A BEST IN CLASS ELECTRICITY INFRASTRUCTURE PARTICULARLY ONE THAT GETS CLEANER. OVERTIME AND DELIVERS ON OUR CLIMATE GOALS. WE CAN'T HAVE 1617% COSTS CAPITAL JUST DOESN'T I'M NOT CLEAR HOW THAT COULD WORK. SO. A LARGE UTILITY FUND WOULD HELP TO SOLVE THOSE ISSUES -- IMPORTANTLY WE SUGGEST THAT. IT SHOULD NOT BE FOREVER. THIS IS THE KIND OF FIND THAT NEEDS TO EXISTS NOW IN THE PRESENT SITUATION BUT NEED NOT INDOOR INDEFINITELY. AND THAT WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT ANY IF IF THE SORT OF AN APPROACH IS TAKEN OR OF ANY SORT OF A FUND IS CREATED THERE BE PERIODIC OFF RAMPS FOR CONSIDERATION -- THAT TO WIND DOWN THE FUND IF AND WHEN WILDFIRE RISKS ARE REDUCED AND WE CAN BE CONFIDENT THAT A VERY LARGE FUND IS NO LONGER REQUIRED -- WE GO INTO SOME DETAIL IN THE REPORT ALSO ABOUT. THE CONSIDERATIONS ENTER INTO HOW BIG A FUND WE NEED. AND I THINK THAT THE REALITY IS THAT THE RISK MODELING IS UNCERTAIN. AND WE HAVE THERE ARE VARIOUS ESTIMATES THAT ARE OUT THERE IN THE IN THE DISCUSSION AROUND HOW BIG A FINE SHOULD BE I I DON'T REALLY NEED TO GET INTO THAT HERE BUT I CAN SPEAK TO THE THE FACTORS THAT MATTER IF YOU LIKE -- I WANT TO ADDRESS IN SOME DETAIL. AN ALTERNATIVE SUGGESTION A SMALLER FUND THAT WE ALSO CONSIDERED AND THINK MAY HAVE SOME MERIT -- THIS IS TERMS IN THE DISCUSSION IN THE BUILDING A LIQUIDITY FUND -- AND I THINK IN CONTRAST TO THE SORT OF INSURANCE POLICY MODEL THE RIGHT WAY TO THINK ABOUT A LIQUIDITY FIND CONCEPTUALLY. THIS IS SORT OF LIKE A BRIDGE LOAN. FOR UTILITIES AND THE GOAL HERE WOULD BE TO PROVIDE MONEY TO THE UTILITIES AS SOON AS IT'S NEEDED TO PAY VICTIMS AFTER A BIG FIRE -- BUT TEND TO REQUIRE REPAYMENT OF THAT MONEY AT THE POINT WHERE A COST RECOVERY APPLICATION OCCURS. ANY IDEA. IN CONTRAST TO SORT OF THE SOLVENCY CREATING STABILITY -- LONG TERM STABILITY GOAL OF THE THE VICTIMS FIND. THE GLOBAL EQUITY FIND IS TO PREVENT INVESTOR PANIC FROM GETTING OUT OF CONTROL AND LEADING TO A BANKRUPTCY AND CERTAINLY THERE WAS A BIT OF A PANIC -- PRIOR TO THE P. JEANNIE FILING P. JEANNIE WAS ESSENTIALLY ISOLATED FROM ALL OF ITS ACCESS TO CAPITAL BY ANY MEANS. AND FACED A CASH SQUEEZE AS ITS CREDITORS WERE ASKING FOR PAYMENT. PAYMENT OF OF LIABILITIES THAT MIGHT COME DUE AT THE END OF THE MONTH. SO A LIQUIDITY FINE WOULD ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM. AND WOULD HELP -- IN THE AFTERMATH OF A FIRE TO PREVENT KIND OF A INVESTOR ANXIETY FROM SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL -- IT WOULD NOT PREVENT A BANKRUPTCY IF THE LIABILITIES ARE IN FACT. FROM FIRE ARE IN FACT A BIGGER THAN THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY RIGHT SO IT'LL PREVENT PANIC FROM GETTING OUT OF CONTROL IT WILL NOT PREVENT THE CALM AND REASONED INVESTOR WHO SORT OF WAYS THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND LOOKS AT THE MAN SAYS THESE WILDFIRE LIFE IS ARE. TOO BIG. FROM WALKING AWAY FROM OUR UTILITIES. SO THAT'S THE I THINK THE CONTRAST -- THE BENEFIT OF A LIQUIDITY FUND IS A COULD BE SMALLER. RIGHT IT COULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY SMALLER THAN IS -- WOULD BE REQUIRED TO ACTUALLY PAY LAIMS AS AN INSURANCE POLICY WOULD DO. WE MAKE A ESSENTIALLY. TWO KINDS OF COST RECOVERY RECOMMENDATIONS ENSURE PETERMAN MENTION THEM I'M JUST GONNA FOR FRAME THEM BRIEFLY IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS FUND DISCUSSION -- WE MENTIONED SOME SMALL WHAT WE THINK OF A SMALLER MODIFICATIONS IS OURS FIRST AND SECOND COST RECOVERY RECOMMENDATIONS THE BURDEN SHIFT -- TO A FOR MORE FOR LIKE STANDARD STANDARD OR AN OF EMPHASIS THAT. THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR COULD PLACE ON VARIOUS THOSE IN SB NINE A ONE COST RECOVERY FACTORS THAT IMPLICATE. THE CONTRIBUTION OF OTHER ACTORS. IN YES A SORT OF A LOT MAKING AN EXPLICIT -- REQUIREMENT TO TO EVALUATE THE THE CONTRIBUTION OF OTHER ACTORS TO THE SEVERITY OF A WILDFIRE THOSE ARE. TWO MORE MODEST MODIFICATIONS TO COST RECOVERY. WE THINK THOSE ARE APPROPRIATE IF THE UTILITIES ARE UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO COME TO THE TABLE WITH SIX SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO SOLVING THIS PROBLEM. IF ON THE OTHER HAND IF THEY CAN. FIND A WAY. TO TRULY PARTICIPATE IN -- IN THE SHARED SACRIFICE THAT WILL BE NECESSARY IN THAT -- TO TO TO STABILIZING THE SITUATION -- WE THINK THAT LARGER -- MODIFICATIONS COST RECOVERY MIGHT BE JUSTIFIED ONE ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE SORT OF A PERMANENT STRESS TESTS SO -- AN APPLICATION OF THE NINE A ONE STRESS TEST WHICH ARE INVESTORS ARE BECOMING MORE FAMILIAR WITH AS THE PROCESS PLAYS OUT AT THE PC -- TO ON ON ON AN ONGOING BASIS MAKE THEIR PROS AND CONS TO THAT APPROACH -- ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE TO SIMPLY REQUIRE THAT IF THERE IS A FIRE -- AND THE UTILITY IS RESPONSIBLE -- OR IS IT FALLS I SHOULD SAY. THAT THE UTILITY SHOULD GIVE UPPER PERCENTAGE OF ITS MARKET CAPITALIZATION PRIOR TO DON THE DAY BEFORE THE FIRE RIGHTS OF THE CHILES WERE TEN BILLION DOLLARS. THE DAY BEFORE FIRE IT CAUSES A FIRE DUE TO IMPRUDENCE OR NEGLIGENCE. H. WHAT HAPPENS SAVE HAVE TO PAY BILLION DOLLARS AND THAT'S IT THEN THE FUND WOULD PICK UP THE REST. THESE KINDS OF LARGE CHANGES TO COST RECOVERY ONLY MAKES SENSE IF THE STATE HAS CREATED THIS LARGE INSURANCE POLICY IN BETWEEN. WILDFIRE LIABILITY AND RATE PAYERS. RIGHT WITHOUT THAT BIG CHANGES TO COST RECOVERY MEANS THAT RATE PAYERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO PAY COSTS. I WOULD JUST ADD AND AND SECOND AND EXTEND ON AND AND SECOND SOMETHING THAT -- CHAIR PETERMAN SAID -- IN HER REMARKS WHICH IS THAT WE ALSO EMPHASIZE. FINES FANTASY PC ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY IS IMPORTANT I THINK TO THE DEGREE THAT WE ARE OFFERING ASSISTANCE TO THE UTILITIES WE SHOULD EMPHASIZE THOSE ISUES AND PERHAPS ALSO CONSIDER HOW TO MAKE MANAGEMENT OF I'LL USE MORE ACCOUNTABLE. TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN SHAREHOLDERS AND THE MANAGEMENT OF THE UTILITIES. AND AS WE ARE EXTENDING HELP WE CAN ALSO ASK FOR VARIOUS THINGS IN RETURN -- AND BE HAPPY TO RESPOND TO QUESTIONS ON THAT IF YOU'RE INTERESTED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR PRESS I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE FOURTH. IN SOME INTERESTING CHALLENGES I'D LIKE. TO EMPHASIZE THAT WAS GOING TO TRY TO BRING THIS UP AT THE END BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT. QUITE ENOUGH IN THIS HEARING SO FAR. YOU TALKED ABOUT WHILE FIRE MITIGATION. AND FUEL LOAD AND FUEL MANAGEMENT. CANDIDLY OVER DECADES AND I'VE BEENENGAGED IN THIS FOR DECADES. PART OF OUR PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN IN THE TENSION. OR PURPOSEFUL NEGLECT OF FORCED IN WILD LANDS. MANAGING. RATHER THAN LEAVE ME ALONE AND THAT'S BEEN OF STATE. LOCAL. AND FEDERAL [inaudible] FORMS. A LOT OF IT'S BEEN DONE STATUTORY AND REGULATORY. BUT IT IS DE TOURED [inaudible] THE OR DISMANTLED IF YOU WILL SOME OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE USED. TO REMOVE FUEL. CO GENERATION FACILITIES MALES. RIGHT NOW THE PARADISE WE'RE PILING UP LOGS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A PLACE TO TAKE A THAT'S GOT TO BE A PART OF THE FUTURE. AND PART OF THAT FUTURE HAS GOT TO BE THE REGULATORY SCHEME. THE STATE. AND LOCAL LEVEL [inaudible] I ALSO. LIKE YOUR IDEA. AND THIS IS. KIND OF UNHEARD OF AROUND HERE. IF YOU TALK ABOUT THIS LIQUIDITY [inaudible] FUN. BUT WHAT YOU SAID. WAS IT SHOULD NOT BE. AN INFINITY. MOST THINGS WE CREATE LEGISLATIVELY OR FOREVER YOU NEVER GET RID OF I LOVE YOUR POINT ABOUT THE OFF RAMP. THAT SOMETHING WILL HAVE A PROSPECT OF TERMINATION. THAT'S A VERY SIGNIFICANT DEPARTURE FROM WHERE WE'VE BEEN. BUT I THINK INCORPORATING THAT INTO SOME OF OUR DIALOGUE AND MAYBE END OF TERMS OF POLICY. MIGHT BE VERY HELPFUL. COULD YOU EXPAND -- JUST A MOMENT THEN ON WHERE YOU WOULD SEE CALIFORNIA GOING NEXT. IN TERMS OF CREATING THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR MANAGING THE FEELS ON THE FORCE. AND THE WILD LANDS. YES SO ON THE ON THE ON THE ON THAT WHAT I WOULD CALL THE MITIGATION A RISK REDUCTION SIDE RESIDES I THINK THE I WOULD ARGUE THAT. THERE ARE SORT OF THREE MAJOR COMPONENTS ONE IS. OUR FUELS MANAGEMENT IN WILD ONCE IN TRUE WILD LANDS. AND DAD YOU KNOW THERE ARE CERTAINLY FIRES THAT START IN IN -- TRULY. IN A WHILE LET AREAS AND THEN BURN INTO COMMUNITIES -- AND BETTER FUELS MANAGEMENT THERE REQUIRES GREATER APPLICATION PRESCRIBED BURNS -- SOME DEGREE MECHANICAL THINNING -- AND WE ARE FAR SHORT OF THE GOALS THAT ARE HAVE BEEN ARTICULATED BY THE STATE AND CERTAINLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS FAR SHORT OF THEIR GOALS. IN TERMS OF TREATMENT OF ACREAGE. OF WILD LANDS I WOULD ARGUE. MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT RIGHT NOW IF WE HAVE TO PRIORITIZE THOUGH. IS. MANAGEMENT AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL FOCUSING ON WHERE PEOPLE LIVE AND IT'S ESPECIALLY AS WE CAN'T THINK ABOUT THE INSURANCE CHALLENGE WHERE THERE IS VALUE AT RISK -- REDUCING FUEL LOADS IN COMMUNITIES IS IS CRITICAL. I HAPPEN TO LIVE IN A IN MARIN COUNTY -- WHERE YOU KNOW HISTORICALLY FUEL LOADS -- PRIOR SETTLEMENT MORE ON THE ORDER OF TWENTY TONS PER ACRE NOW THEY'RE ON THE ORDER OF A HUNDRED TWENTY TIMES BREAKER IN MANY PARTS OF MARIN COUNTY. THAT'S A TIME BOMB. AND IT'S A TIME BOMB WHERE THERE ARE MANY MANY PEOPLE LIVING WITH INADEQUATE INGRESS AND EGRESS. AND THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND AND IT'S A HUGE PROBLEM. IT'S NOT JUST COASTAL CALIFORNIA IT'S ALSO IN THE SIERRA NEVADA. AND I THINK THAT IS THE SECOND SILO IN THE THIRD SILOS WE NEED TO HER. HARDEN HOMES AND HAVE A WAY TO HELP LOW INCOME AND FIXED INCOME RESIDENTS A CALIFORNIA FINANCE HARDENING OF THEIR HOMES -- IN A IN A WAY THAT CAN WORK FOR THEM SO THAT THEY ARE SAFER IN A FIRE. WELL AT LEAST WE'RE TALKING MORE ABOUT IT NOW THEN YOU SPECIFICALLY HAVE AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT. THE SENTENCE THANK YOU SENATOR CENTER HERTZBERG. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WANT TO ADDRESS THREE THINGS THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT. FIRST THE BANKRUPTCY SECOND MITIGATION TO FOLLOW ON CENTER NIELSEN AND THIRD THE BRIDGE LONG. OUR JULY EACH ONE OF THOSE POINTS A LITTLE BIT MORE DEEPLY IN TERMS OF GIVING US GUIDES OF HOW WE SHOULD PROCEED. HE SAID THAT YOU SAW THE OBVIOUSLY WE KNOW THAT THEIR SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES BACK TO THE CHAPTER PROCEEDING. THE QUICK AND YOU SAID THEY CAN BE OVERCOME WERE YOUR WORDS WHAT SPECIFIC GUIDANCE WOULD YOU WOULD YOU SUGGEST TO THIS COMMITTEE THAT WE COULD USE TO OVERCOME THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE BANKRUPTCY IN TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER. A SOLUTION IN THE NEAR TERM WE'VE GOT THE ALL THE REASONS THATYOU KNOW WELL AND BY THE WAY LET ME JUST THANK YOU FOR YOUR EXTRAORDINARY WORK ON THE STUFF AND HELP IN. SPAWNING BELIEVE WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU CENTER HERTZBERG -- WITH RESPECT TO BANKRUPTCY I THINK THAT -- WE ARE SEEING DIFFERENT -- COMMITTEES WITHIN THE BANKRUPTCY EMERGE WITH SORT OF INTERESTING IDEAS. ARE AND THE SENATE -- AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE -- I THINK WOULD BENEFIT FROM UNDERSTANDING THOSE IDEAS VETTING MA'AM. ARM AND AND IDEALLY. YOU KNOW IN IN A BANKRUPTCY PROCESS YOU HAVE COMPETITION RIGHT YOU SEXUALLY HAVE AN AUCTION TO CREATE. THE GREATEST ENTERPRISE VALUE WITH THE THAT THAT'S POSSIBLE FROM THE COMPANY SO THAT EVERYONE WHO'S A CLAIMANT GETS PAID AS MUCH MONEY AS POSSIBLE. AND I THINK WE'RE SEEING THAT SORT OF A PROCESS START TO EMERGE I THINK JUDGMENT HOLLY. IS. ATTENTIVE TO THAT EMERGENCE AND THE STATE -- CAN DO MUCH TO ENCOURAGE IT BY SIGNALING ITS INTEREST AND AND AND AND SIGNALING THAT IT IS INTEREST INTERESTED IN HEARING OFFERS. BUT CAN I JUST DILLON SETTLED WITH MORE YES YOU KNOW WE HAVE LIMITED TOOLS WE GET A BUDGET REQUEST WE CAN WE CAN AND SPEND MONEY WE CAN DRAFT LEGISLATION IN ORDER TO SOLVE. HERE WE ARE IF YOU IN FACT HAVE A NUMBER OF COMMITTEES OF IDEAS AND YOU CAN CREATE ENTERPRISE VALUE ALL OF WHICH ARE FANTASTIC AND I DO THINK THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES THERE. BUT IN YOUR JUDGMENT IF YOU JUST GIVE US A LITTLE BIT MORE OF YOUR THINKING ABOUT HOW TO YOU DRILL INTO THAT HE CAN'T ADOPT A PARTICULAR PLAN. CERTAINLY WE WANT AS AS PROTECTING THE PUBLIC IS PROTECTING RATE PAYERS AND TAXPAYERS AND EVERYBODY ELSE. THE MOST INTELLIGENT PLAN GOING FORWARD HOW WOULD YOU SUGGEST WE PROCEED THAT GIVES US THE BEST BENEFIT. IN THE INTRIGUE OF HOW BANKRUPTCY COURTS WORK STILL BOUND BY WHAT THE RATING AGENCIES HAVE IMPOSED UPON US. SO I I YOU KNOW I THINK ONE APPROACH. MIGHT BE TO IMPOSE CONDITIONALITY RIGHT SET OUT WHAT THE STATE WOULD LIKE MAKE SURE THAT IT'S VETTED AND REASONABLE -- AND THEN -- ALLOW P. JEANNIE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN A PROGRAM THAT WILL HELP TO STABILIZE IT. IF IT SO CHOOSES AND THEN LEAVE IT TO THE BANKRUPTCY PARTICIPANTS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ENABLE THAT PARTICIPATION IN THAT BUT YOU WOULD SEE WITH IF IT HAPPENED WITH THE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS WERE P. G. IN THE STILL HAD CONTROL OVER IT'S A IT'S A PLAN. THAT IF IN FACT WEEK PROVIDE THAT LEVEL OF GUIDANCE YOU COULD SEE THAT IN THE P. JEANNIE PLAN WITH JUDGE MOUNT HOLLY NOW. YES AND I THINK IF P. JEANNIE -- MANAGEMENT DID NOT COME FORWARD WITH A PLAN THAT ALLOWED IT TO PARTICIPATE SOMEBODY ELSE WOULD A MALE AND JUDGMENT TALLY WOULD ALLOW THAT PLAN -- TO PROCEED AND WOOD WOOD WOOD BUT PREMATURELY AND THE EXCLUSIVE EXCLUSIVITY PERIOD AND SECONDLY WITH RESPECT TO MITIGATION YOU SAID SOMETHING CAUGHT MY ATTENTION. SIX TO ONE SIX TWO ONE THE LAST HEARING WE HAD FROM THE GOVERNOR'S TEAM WE WE SAW ONE CHART THAT SHOWED VERY LIMITED IMPACT. YOU KNOW AYE AYES FEATURE OF NATURAL RESOURCES AND WON THE FIRST FEELS LIKE HEARINGS I HELD WAS CLEARING THE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION TREES BUT JUSTICE. CENTER NIELSEN SAYS THERE WASN'T A LOT OF INTEREST IN THE BUDGET TIME TO BE ABLE TO SPEND THAT MONEY. BUT THE FOCUS IN TERMS OF YOU ARE IN IN GIVING THE ANSWER TO CENTER NIELSEN WHICH I THINK WAS QUITE INSIGHTFUL WAS DIVIDING UP THE MITIGATION IDEA TO THREE CONSCIOUS. PEOPLE MANAGEMENT THE CLEARING AND ALSO THE HARDENING OF HOMES AND THE HARDENING OF HOMES AND CLEARING SPACE THE DISPENSABLE SPACE I THINK SENATOR GERMAN HAS A BILL ON THAT. THOSE TWO THINGS COSTS THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF BOTH WRIST TO HUMAN LIFE. AND PROPERTY DAMAGE TO WHICH CENTER JACKSON REFERRED SO THE IDEA WAS SEEMS THAT IN TERMS OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT THAT THE HIGHEST AND BEST USE OF THOSE REST DOLLARS THAT WE HAVE. GOVERNOR'S ALLOCATING OR WE MIGHT WANT TO PROPOSE WOULD BE TO TALK ABOUT HARDENING OF HOMES INDISPENSABLE SPACE. TO REDUCE THAT THAT RISK PROFILE AS MUCH AS WE POSSIBLY COULD IS THAT A FAIR STATEMENT. YEAH THAT'S A FAIR STATEMENT OKAY AND THE MORE WE PUT IN INTELLIGENTLY OF A SPENT X. EXPEDITED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE WITH ALSO COULD FOLLOW THAT'S SUPPORT THAT LINE IF YOU'RE THINKING CORRECT I AGREE I THINK TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE OKAY LAST POINT. WHICH FINANCING YOUR BRIDGE FINANCING WITH RESPECT TO LIQUIDITY FUND WHAT I'M INTERESTED THERE YES IT DOES GIVE US A SMALLER NUMBER YES IT GIVES COOLEY QUIDDITY O THE ENTITIES INTERESTING. BUT THE MOST PROBATIVE ELEMENT OF THAT SEEMS TO ME IS WE'LL THAT INFORMED THE RATING AGENCIES TO GIVE THEM COMFORT. EVEN IF TAKE LET'S ASSUME WE DO THE SIX TO ONE WE COME UP WITH A LOT OF MONEY IN HARDING LET'S ASSUME WE DO THESE OTHER THINGS. IS A LIQUIDITY FUND AS COMPARED BROADLY SPEAKING TO A LIABILITY INSURANCE POLICY. SOMETHING THAT IN YOUR BEST GAS BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE JUST GUESSING BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT A RATING AGENCY BUT YOU CERTAINLY HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON HERE AT ALL WE CAN DO IS RELY ON YOUR JUDGMENT. IS THAT. A COURSE THAT WILL RESULT IN THE RATING AGENCIES. ARE GIVING US THE CLEARANCE SO WE DON'T HAVE THESE BIG HIGH PRICES FOR BARRING THAT RESULTS IN RATE PAYERS EPENSES GOING UP BECAUSE THE COST OF CAPITAL SO I IN MY JUDGMENT. THE RATINGS AGENCIES AT THIS POINT GIVEN THAT THEY'VE YOU INVERSE CONDEMNATION REFORM IS A LOW PROBABILITY OUTCOME. ARE MOST INTERESTED IN -- CHANGES TO THE COST RECOVERY REGIME THAT MAKE IT VERY CERTAIN. THAT IF THERE IS A SO CALLED WILDFIRE EXPENSE IT WILL BE PASSED TO RATE PAYERS -- IF. THE AND THAT IS WHAT WILL. INCREASE CERTAINTY FOR INVESTORS THAT THEY HAVE A LOWER RISK INVESTMENTS IN A CALIFORNIA UTILITY WHICH IS WHAT THEY WANT TO AND FRANKLY WHAT WE WANT UTILITIES TO BE LOW RISK AS WELL SO THEY HAVE LOW BORROWING COSTS AND CAN BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE. COST EFFECTIVELY. THE PROBLEM IS. IN THE CURRENT SITUATION IF WE WERE -- TO DE RISK UTILITY COST RECOVERY THAT'S EXPOSING RATE PAYERS TO POTENTIALLY PUNISHING EXPENSE. AND AND SO YOU COULD HAVE A YOU KNOW THAT THERE THERE ARE THERE IS PROBABLY A SWEET SPOT IN THE LIQUIDITY FUNDS WHERE YOU BILL TO FIND IS LARGE ENOUGH. YOU GIVE SOME MODEST. COST RECOVERY REFORMS AND AND AND AND I THINK YOU KNOW PERHAPS -- YOU COULD BRAIN THE RATING AGENCIES TO THE TABLE PARTICULARLY IF THAT WERE PAIRED WITH YOU KNOW MASSIVE INVESTMENTS AND MITIGATION RIGHT SO YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A SMALLER RISK OF RAW. I GUESS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WE YOU WOULD NEED TO CONSULT WITH ASSN P. IN MOVIES AND TO TO REALLY KNOW FOR SURE THAT AT AND TO CAN I JUST FOLLOW UP ON THAT JUST. APOLOGIZE TO DRILL THE THE BILL A LITTLE IN DEEPER WE TALKED ABOUT VARIOUS COMMITTEES COMING FORTH WITH IDEAS AND CREATING COMPETITION A GREAT ENTERPRISE VALUE. IF YOU WERE. TO SIX A LIQUIDITY FUND VERSUS A LIABILITY FUND WOULD NOT BE EASIER AND I COULD BE WRONG I'M NOT TRYING TO BE LEADING THE NEW ON THIS I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IT BY LEADING YOU. WOULD NOT BE EASIER IF YOU'RE GOING TO GET EQUITY OUT OF SHAREHOLDERS OR LENDERS WHO WHOEVER THEY MIGHT BE WOULDN'T IT BE EASIER ENOUGH TO GET THAT MONEY INTO A FUND THAN JUST BASICALLY A BANK. WHICH WAS A LOAN FUND WHERE THEY WOULD ACTUALLY YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF A FOR ONE OF OUR CHALLENGE WERE FACING IS YOU KNOW ALL THESE THINGS WERE JUGGLING RIGHT WE'RE TRYING TO MINIMIZE THAT SHOCK STICKER SHOCK TO TO RATE PAYERS IS REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK FAIR TO SAY. THE COMMITTEE REALLY IMPORTANT THE SAME TIME WE WANT TO SEE IF WE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT COMPETITION IN THE IN THE WAY THAT PROTECTS US IS CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS AND RATEPAYERS. CAN WE DO THAT AND IS THE FUND THE MODEL A BETTER MODEL TO CONSTRUCT IN YOUR JUDGMENT THEN THE BRIDGE FINANCING MODEL. I THINK THE BRIDGE FINANCING MODEL IF WE CANNOT. BRAIN UTILITIES TO THE TABLE -- IF THEY DON'T SEE IT IS IN THEIR INTEREST TO PARTICIPATE THE BRIDGE FINANCING MODEL HAS A LOT GOING FOR IT -- IF WE CAN. AND THEY ARE WILLING -- TO PUT. IF THEY'RE WILLING TO YOU KNOW AND WE WE DON'T SPECIFY NUMBERS IN OUR REPORT WE THINK OF THIS IS KIND OF ROUGHLY EQUAL CONTRIBUTIONS RIGHT. RATEPAYERS PUT A DOLLAR ON THE TABLE SHAREHOLDERS ARE PUTTING IT ON THE TABLE IF THAT KIND OF ARRANGEMENT AS POSSIBLE -- THEN THE LARGER FIND -- IS A IS AN INTRIGUING POSSIBILITY TO CONSIDER AND WHERE DOES THE MONEY COME FOR THE BRIDGE FINANCING MODEL WAS A CABS REGIONALLY IT WOULD COME FROM REPAIRS. BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO REALIZE REPAIRS WOULD NOT -- LATELY IT'S BECAUSE IT'S A REVOLVING LOAN REPAIRS ARE GONNA GET BACK THE MONEY WILL GO OUT AND IT'LL COME BACK IN. INTERIOR. YEAH THAT THE PRIMARY RISK THAT I WORRY ABOUT IN THAT CONTEXT WOULD BE. EIGHTY A BRIDGE LOAN TO AN ENTITY TO GOES BANKRUPT -- THAT'S THAT'S THE RISK I THINK THEIR WAYS OF MANAGING AT RISK. SO I THINK OUR GENEROSITY. REALLY WANTED TO GO IN. THANK YOU PROFESSOR WHO ARE I I JUST WANT TO GO OVER A FEW ASSUMPTIONS VERY BASIC -- THE FIRST IS THAT -- CALIFORNIA IS UNIQUE IN THIS PLANET. THAT ARE WILDFIRES ARE STARTED BY UTILITIES IT DOESN'T HAPPEN. I MEAN WE HAVE WILD FIRES ALL OVER THE GLOBE EUROPE. FLORIDA. ARIZONA BUT WE'RE UNIQUE THAT THERE [inaudible] UTILITY. START ARM. UTILITIES. IN GENERAL STARFIRE'S IF YOU STRAIN HIGH VOLTAGE WIRES THAT ARE UNINSULATED ALL OVER THE LANDSCAPE AND THERE ARE TREES AND THERE IS WHETHER. THOSE WIRES WILL EVENTUALLY FALL DOWN AND SOMETIMES THEY WILL START FIRES. USUALLY THE DIFFERENCE WHAT'S GOING ON IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S DIFFERENT IS THAT. WHEN THOSE FIRE STARTS AT CERTAIN POINTS IN THE FALL IN CALIFORNIA? THERE IS NO WAY TO PUT THEM OUT. OUR AND THE THE ONLY POSSIBLE RESPONSE OF FIRST RESPONDERS TO TRY TO MOVE PEOPLE OUT OF THE WAY. THAT'S DIFFERENT. AND ENGINE THAT HASN'T BEEN THE EXPERIENCE IN OTHER STATES AT LEAST SO FAR. NOW I COME FROM A COUNTY THAT HAS WID BUYER EXPERIENCE TO ME LOOK AT AUSTRALIA AND OTHER MODELS. BUT I'M JUST TRYING. TO YOU AS WE FOCUS ON THIS TOPIC WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT CALIFORNIA THIS UNIQUE PLACE ON THE PLANET THAT HAS UTILITIES STARTED FIRES -- SO THAT MEANS WE HAVE NO MODELS THERE'S NO OTHER. MUNICIPALITY ON THE GLOBE THAT'S GOT A VICTIMS FUND CORRECT -- THERE ARE NO THERE'S NO EQUIVALENT FOR UTILITY COST WILDFIRE. THERE ARE FUNDS THEIR SO CALLED CATASTROPHE FUNDS THAT A NUMBER OF STATES IN THE UNITED STATES OF CREATED THE BEAR SOME RESEMBLANCE SO IN PARTICULAR. THE FLORIDA HER KINKY TAX FREE FUND IS ONE EXAMPLE THERE ARE MODIFICATIONS OF THE FAIR PLAN IN OTHER STATES IN THE SOUTHEAST THAT LOOK A LOT LIKE A CATASTROPHE FOUNDER OF VICTIMS FUND -- BUT THEY ARE DIFFERENT IN THE SENSE THAT THEY PAY. THEIR DAY ARE IN GENERAL EITHER -- THERE IS THERE IN GENERAL -- A REINSURER SO THEY THEY BACKED THE PRIMARY HOME INSURERS RATHER THAN BACKING THE UTILITIES AGAINST THIRD PARTY CLAIMS. THANK YOU THEN I I'LL DO MORE RESEARCH ON HER CANE. I'D BE HAPPY TO SHARE SOME INFORMATION WITH YOU ABOUT THAT THAT'S REAL HELPFUL AND I APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE I'M. I'M TRYING TO LOOK AT YOUR COMMENT IT WOULD JUST TAKE LEADERSHIP. WE JUST YOU KNOW WE JUST NEED TO DO THIS AND AND I'M KINDA LOOKING AT THE CONSTRAINTS FROM MY LITTLE VANTAGE POINT BUT I'M LOOKING AT LET'S SAY A BUDGET WHERE WE GET THE LARGEST BUDGET WE'VE EVER. PRODUCED. WORKING ON THE BUDGET LAST NIGHT ABOUT TEN PM. AND I DID SEE ONE DOLLAR GO. TO ANY FUND FOR FIRE MEDICATION OR VICTIMS BUT I DIDN'T SEE THE STATE'S STEP UP WITH ONE DOLLAR I SAW A LOT OF PORK GOING TO A LOT OF DISTRICTS IN THIS STATE -- I SAW A DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUND REDUCED 50% BECAUSE WE WERE GIVING SO MUCH MONEY AWAY. TO OTHER OTHERAREAS AND I'M AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE IS THE LEADERSHIP GOING TO COME FROM -- BECAUSE JUST LAST WEEK WE WE RECEIVED OUR COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT. YOU KNOW GETTING IN JUNE A YEAR LATER AFTER THE YEAR AND ALMOST. AND WE HAVE THE LARGEST UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT OUR STATE'S HISTORY IT'S NOW 200-13 BILLION FOR A GOVERNMENTAL ACTIVITIES AND WE'RE TALKING REPAIRS WERE TALKING TAXPAYERS THEIR THEIR STOCK CAN MEAN WE'RE TALKING OVER UTILITIES REALLY GOVERNMENT AND JUST. YOU KNOW SEGREGATED FORM AND AND SO I'M I'M TRYING [inaudible] TO FIGURE OUT. HOW TO FIX THIS BECAUSE OUR ELECTRICITY RATES ARE REALLY REALLY HIGH? P. GENIES RATES ARE WELL ABOVE THE NATIONAL AND AND STATE RATES AND AS WE HAVE INDUSTRY THAT'S NOT GONNA DO WELL IF WE RAISE THEIR RATES. ASKING THEM TO OKAY YOU BE A LEADER IN THEIR KIND OF GOING WELL MAYBE WILL LEAD SOMEWHERE ELSE BECAUSE WE CAN MANUFACTURE. SO I'M LOOKING AT ALL THESE CONSTRAINTS IN A BAD BALANCE SHEET HI RATES NO WILLINGNESS TO SET BONTA SIDE IN THIS BUDGET TO REALLY. SHOW SOME RESOLVE [inaudible] SO. I'M KIND OF DUMPING IT ON YOU I'M KIND OF COMPLAINING BUT I'M TRYING THIS BABY PLEADING LIKE OKAY WHERE. WHERE'S THE MOVEMENT GOING TO BE. WELL I I DON'T. HAVE A CLEAR ANSWER THEIR CENTER MORE LUCK BUT I WOULD SAY THAT. ANY POLICY PROPOSAL. SHOULD GO THROUGH AN ANALYSIS WORRIED IT IS SHOWN. THAT THE FUND OR WHATEVER WE ENACT -- IS BETTER FOR RATEPAYERS. THAN THE STATUS QUO. RIGHT AT YOU KNOW WE NEED TO THERE THERE NEEDS TO BE A SHOWING. AND THE STATUS QUO IS GRAHAM YOU KNOW I MENTIONED ACOSTA CAPITAL REQUESTS. I HAD THE OTHER ISSUES ARE WHAT HAPPENS WITH ABOUT WHILE FAR LIABILITIES WHAT HAPPENS YOU KNOW THE COST OF GREAT HARDENING ARE NONTRIVIAL. THEY'RE GONNA HAPPEN OVER THE NEXT DECADE SO. RATES ARE UNFORTUNATELY GOING UP. AND THE QUESTION IS CAN A WELFARE FUNDS. STABILIZE THAT SITUATION MAKE THINGS LESS BAD THAN THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN -- AND AND AND HELP -- TO TO INSURE BOTH SAID REPAIRS DON'T GET SURPRISED WITH THE BILL SO THEY CAN PLAN AND ALSO THAT VICTIMS GET PAID. THANK YOU PROFESSOR THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU PROFESSOR FOR ALL THE TIME YOU SPENT ON THIS IT'S IT'S PHENOMENAL MUCH APPRECIATED. OF YOU MENTION WE TALK ABOUT THE THE CREATION AND THE ESTABLISHMENT FUND THAT THERE WOULD BE. NO OF RATE PAYERS IN THE UTILITIES AND OTHER ACTORS WHO THOSE OTHER ACTORS THAT WOULD PARTICIPATE IN THAT THAT YOU SEE. IN THE INNER REPORT. WE SUGGESTS THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD AT LEAST CONSIDER THE IDEA OF A SURCHARGE AND INSURANCE RATES -- ELECTRICITY RATES IN CALIFORNIA ARE AMONG THE HIGHEST. IN THE NATION OUR BILLS ARE MORE UNDER CONTROL BECAUSE OF OUR VERY AGGRESSIVE ENERGY EFFICIENCY POLICIES. ARE BY THE THE ON OUR HOME INTEREST RATES ARE ACTUALLY -- ON THE VERY LOW AND I THINK WE'RE FORTY SECONDS -- BEFORE YOU EVEN ADJUST FOR INCOME AND VALUE IN SHIRT WHICH OBVIOUSLY. VERY DIFFERENT CALIFORNIA AND IN MANY PLACES NOW OF COURSE. IN THE WILL BE IN THE HIGH RISK AREAS LIKE WHERE SENATOR JACKSON LIVES. OUT WHERE I LIVE -- I AND NUMBER OF MY NEIGHBORS HAVE RECENTLY GONE TO LLOYDS OF LONDON TO GET THEIR POLICIES -- THEY THE COSTS ARE MUCH HIGHER -- THE IDEA OF A SURCHARGE AN INSURANCE RACES IS ONE THAT WE SUGGEST WHAT WE THINK -- YOU KNOW CONCEPTUALLY IT MAKES SENSE THERE ARE GOING TO BE SOME LEGAL CHALLENGES THAT NEED TO BE OVERCOME IF THAT'S A POLICY APPROACH IT'S TAKEN -- ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF MANAGING PROPOSITION TWENTY SIX REQUIREMENTS. OTHER ONE IS YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. REPAIR RESPONSIBILITY IN SOME IS PART OF THE FUND AND THEN ELSEWHERE WHERE DO YOU SEE AND WHERE DOES THE THE THE COMMITTEE LOOK AT THE YOU KNOW WE SEE THAT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE FUND AND THEN. UTILITIES WILL CONTRIBUTE PERHAPS INSURANCE SURCHARGE ALL OF THESE OF THE WHERE DO YOU SEE THE RATE PAYERS ROLE IN THIS IN TERMS OF ANOTHER PART OF THAT WITH. YOU KNOW THEIR RESPONSIBILITY AND I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE THEIR PRESENCE BECAUSE OF THE THERE'S A COST THERE REGARDLESS WHEN WE TO LOOK AT THE THE COST OF BORROWING MONEY AND AND AND ELSEWHERE SO WHERE DO YOU SEE THE RATE PAYERS. PART IN THIS IN TERMS OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY -- WITH A LIABILITY WITHOUT LIABILITY IS IT BECAUSE OF THAT. THE FACT THAT IF YOU HAVE -- HE WITH INVERSE IF. AS I LOOK AT IT IF THERE'S NO NEGLIGENCE NO LIABILITY ON THE PART OF THE UTILITY WE WE SHOULD SOCIALIZED ACOSTA BE I THINK THAT EVERYONE SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE IS THAT WHERE YOU'RE SEEN THAT ROLE FOR THE REPAIRS IN THAT FUND IN THOSE OR CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE. THERE IS CHAIRED LIABILITY. WELL I THINK ON THE ROLE FOR RATE THE APPROPRIATE ROLE FOR RATEPAYERS. IS -- TO PAY COSTS WHEN THERE IS NO FAULT ON THE PART OF THE UTILITY IN A GIVEN THE INVERSE CONDEMNATION FRAMEWORK THAT WE HAVE -- BUT I THINK THAT THE REALITY AND AND AND AND SPEAKING SORT OF AS A STUDENT OF ENERGY REGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES THE REALITY IS THAT WHEN. MASSIVE LIFE UNEXPECTED LIABILITIES OCCUR IN THE POWER SECTOR IN REGULATED INDUSTRIES RIGHT. IF YOU LOOK BACK THROUGH HISTORY AT THE NUCLEAR POWER PLANT DISALLOWANCE IS THAT OCCURRED IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES FOR EXAMPLE -- WE SEE YOU KNOW ACTOR FOR RECENT NUCLEAR POWER PLANT DISALLOWANCE IS THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN SOUTH CAROLINA. WHAT WE SEE IS A HISTORY OF SHARED SACRIFICE RIGHT EVERYONE IS EVERYONE IS FORCED TO CONTRIBUTE THE SHAREHOLDERS ARE FORCED TO CONTRIBUTE? THE RATE PAYERS ARE FORCED TO CONTRIBUTE BECAUSE WE ALL THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS NEED A STABLE BUSINESS. THE RATE PAYERS NEED PROVISION OF AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE. AND USUALLY IN THE REGULAR ORDER OF BUSINESS THAT CAN BE HANDLED AT THE P. YOU SEE. THROUGH A PROCESS OF REGULATION APPLICATION OF THE PRUDENT MANAGER STANDARD BUT THEN THERE ARE EXTRAORDINARY TIMES WHEN. IT IS SORT OF HIS ABOVE THE P. UC'S PAY GRADE FRANKLY AND THE LEGISLATURE. LOOKS AT THE AUTHORITY IT HASN'T HIT DELEGATES TO THE PC NORMALLY IN AND HAS TO MAKE THAT CALL. ABOUT HOW TO ALLOCATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR GETTING OUT OF A WHOLE. ARM AND I GUESS MY VIEW WOULD BE THAT EVERYONE SHOULD CONTRIBUTE. THAT WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT AS WE ARE MAKING THESE SHARED CONTRIBUTIONS THE UTILITIES ARE SETTING THEIR HOUSE IN ORDER. SO THAT THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. AND WE NEED TO HOLD THE TELLY MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTABLE AND SURE THAT METRICS ARE IN PLACE TO SEE THAT APPROPRIATE PERFORMANCE GOALS ARE SAT. AND DELIVERED ON IN A TIMELY WAY. AND WITH WITH THOSE PRECONDITIONS. I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT WE ALL CONTRIBUTE TO STATE BECAUSE WE ALL BENEFIT WHEN THE POWER SYSTEM WORKS WELL. THANK YOU [inaudible] WHO ARE? I THINK SO MUCH IS THE CHAIR SCRIPTURE THANKS FOR ALL YOUR WORK SIR AT YOU HAVE BEEN LIVING THE DREAM FOR THE PAST MANY MANY MIND SO -- VERY GRATEFUL. THAT THE PUBLIC TWITTER YEAH I'D LIKE TO BE TO DRILL DOWN A LITTLE FURTHER ON ALL ISSUES OF MITIGATION. AND YOU'VE BEEN SAYING TIME AND TIME AGAIN THAT WE ARE UNDER FUNDED. WHETHER IT'S UNDER FUNDING WHEN IT COMES OF VEGETATION MANAGEMENT UNDER FIND WHEN IT COMES TO HOME HARDENING. SOME -- RESPONSES CAME BACK UP WE'RE ASKING FOLKS WHO LOST THEIR HOME. LOST THEIR HOME AND THEY HAD -- MORE AGGRESSIVE HOME PARTIES IN IS IN AND THEN SOME NEIGHBORS DID -- BACK IN THE EIGHTIES. I AND NOW WE'RE GONNA ASSN TO BE ABLE TO REBUILD. POTENTIALLY WITH. HIGHER STANDARDS AGAIN. HOW DO YOU SEE THIS PLANE NOW? ARMED WITH THOSE FOLKS WHO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD -- AND THEN THE OTHER PIECES -- HOW DO YOU SEE THIS PLAYING OUT? RELATED TO FOLKS WHO HAVEN'T BEEN HIT BY FIRE BUT CAN'T GET INSURANCE. SO. I I GUESS. THE LET ME RESPOND TO THE QUESTIONS IN TURN. THE CHALLENGE FOR FOLKS IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE LIVING IN COMMUNITIES YOU KNOW THAT HAVE BEEN HIT BY FIRE OR HAVEN'T BEEN HIT BY FIRE YET. BUT WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING BUT LIVE IN OLDER HOUSING STOCK. IS ENORMOUS YEAH AND I THINK THE STATE HAS A ROLE TO PLAY NOT NECESSARILY IN PAIN. FOR THE THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT NEED TO BE MADE BUT IT AT LEAST PERHAPS IN FINANCING AND ASSISTING. THOSE -- HOMEOWNERS TO TO AFFORD THE KINDS OF INVESTMENTS AND AND THE INVESTMENTS ARE NOT MASSIVE REYES. TO ASPHALT ROOF. COVERED EVE'S IT OUT BETTER VANCE IN A MASH IN IN THE VANCE -- AND AND THEN CREATION OF SENSIBLE SPACE. BUT MANY PEOPLE. CAN'T AFFORD EVEN THAT. AND SO THERE IS A ROLE AND I THINK FOR STATE ASSISTANCE THERE -- THE ON THE INSURANCE QUESTION. YEAH I I THINK THERE ARE NOT SIMPLE ANSWERS HERE OTHER THAN THE KIND OF VERY LARGE PROGRAM. THAT. BOB WE'VE DISCUSSED UP THE INSURANCE SITUATION IN CALIFORNIA IS WHAT WE DESCRIBE IN THE REPORT AS FRAGILE -- IT'S DIFFICULT TO GET GOOD INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON SO MUCH OF THE INFORMATION ABOUT NON RENEWALS AT THIS POINT IS REALLY ANECDOTAL -- BUT CONCERNING VERY CONCERNING AND THE THE BIG QUESTION THAT I HAVE IS HOW. YOU KNOW I MENTIONED -- REINSURANCE AS AN ISSUE THE THE ABILITY OF CALIFORNIA. SURE IT'S RISK. OUTSIDE THE BORDERS IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR MAKING INSURANCE AFFORDABLE WITHIN THE BORDERS OF THE STATE. AND THE FOLKS YOU KNOW IN BERMUDA. REALLY THAT OFFER US COVERAGE FOR WILDFIRE. ARE GETTING VERY NERVOUS. AND I WORRY THAT. WE WILL FIND A HARDENING OF THAT MARKET LEADING TO A HARDENING OF THE HOME INTEREST MARKET WITHIN THE STATE. AND IT THIS WILL SPREAD BY BEYOND -- THERE ARE. IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU COUNT THEM BUT THERE ARE ABOUT A MILLION HOMES IN CALIFORNIA OUT OF TWELVE MILLION. THAT ARE AND SEVERE. HAZARD ZONES THERE ABOUT THREE AND A HALF MILLION IN THE WE WE GENERALLY. THAT'S A LOT OF HOUSING STOCK. THE COULD FACE A REAL CRISIS IN TERMS OF ABILITY TO NOT DEFAULT ON A MORTGAGE OR ABILITY TO SELL. IF -- TO A NEW BUYER WHO WOULD HAVE TO ACQUIRE INSURANCE THEY ACTUALLY RIGHT I THINK THAT IN YOU'D MENTIONED RAIN COUNTY BRING COUNTY YOU'RE SEEN ENTIRE SWATHS OF CITIES. AT HOMEOWNERS WHO ARE AN INCORPORATED CITY. OUR CHALLENGE TO BE ABLE TO PURCHASE TRADITIONAL LAKE COUNTY IS A WHOLE NOTHER UNIVERSE WHERE -- ENTIRE COMMUNITIES. I THINK THE OTHER CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE IS THERE IS. ISN'T A GRACE ABILITY TO COLLECT THE DATA TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE HARD NUMBERS OF THOSE WHO ARE BEING NON RENEWED. I AND I KNOW WE NEED TO TREAD LIGHTLY ON THAT BASE OF A PROPOSITION BUT SIMPLY BEING ABLE TO SEE -- PERCENTAGES I KNOW THAT SOME THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT OF BASED OFF THE ZIP CODE. OF WHO IS RECEIVING NUMBER NO ONE KNOWS I THINK IT'S GONNA BE IMPORTANT SO THAT WERE ABLE TO SEE REALLY WHAT THAT LIABILITY IS. I AUTHORS ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IT'S IT'S HARD TO BE TO GET THE ACTUAL HARD DATA I COMPLETELY AGREE AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE SUGGEST THE NUMBER OF DATA CALLS. ARE FROM THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT INSURANCE AND INSURANCE CHAPTER OF OUR REPORT. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE VICTIMS WEALTH FIRE VICTIMS FUND IS SUPERIOR TO LIQUIDITY. FIVE BECAUSE ONE OF THE REASONS OBVIOUSLY HAVE AN INTEREST IN. HELPING FOR ASSISTING P. GENIE TO HELP ITSELF EMERGE FROM BANKRUPTCY IN YOUR AND WE'RE TRYING TO IMPROVE. SOLVENCY OF ALL OF ALL -- UTILITIES IN IN THE WAY WE DO THAT IS WE TRY. TO REDUCE THE LOOK OR MINIMIZE THE THE LIABILITIES IN ORDER TO INVEST WERE. ATTRACT CAPITAL IN THE BANKRUPTCY THAT WILL ALLOW. A PLAN THAT WILL ASK FOR NEW MONEY TO COME IN AND THAT MONEY IS NOT GONNA COME IN UNLESS WE DO SOMETHING ON THE MITIGATION HARDENING AND ALL THAT BUT ALSO LIMIT THE CAPITAL BECAUSE THERE ARE FORTY NINE OTHER STATES THAT. THAT CAPITAL FUNDS CAN PUT THEIR MONEY INTO AND GET THEIR 10%. RETURN ON INVESTMENT -- IT SO IF WE DON'T TAKE CARE OF THAT PIECE IT SEEMS LIKE. OUR WERE JUST -- INVITING THESE ARE THE UTILITIES. TWO YOU KNOW THE FAULT OR ENTER INTO BANKRUPTCY TO DEAL WITH THIS UNCERTAINTY ON THE ON THE LIABILITY PIECE IN MY GETTING THIS WRONG [inaudible] WELL -- THE THING TO REMEMBER. IS THAT WHILE A LARGER FIND. WELL CREATE A YOU KNOW ON AN INSURANCE POLICY AS OPPOSED -- TO A BRIDGE LOAN IT'S A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE. BOB AND IF NOTHING IS FREE IN THIS CONVERSATION. SO -- YES I THINK IT WOULD CREATE GREATER CERTAINTY BUT AT A GREATER COST. AND THE QUESTION IS -- YOU KNOW IS IS IS IS IS IT IN THE INTERESTS OF THE STATE GIVEN THAT COST TO CREATE. A FIND OF THE SCALE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SUFFICIENT TO MANAGE THIS RISK. TO GET TO A HEART INTEGRATED -- AND I THINK THE ANSWER DEPENDS ON IT DEPENDS ESPECIALLY ON WHO IS PAYING THAT LARGER COST. RIGHT I MEAN A CERTAIN CERTAINLY THE CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA HAS A PORTION OF IT BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT P. JEANNIE VOLUNTARILY -- CONTRIBUTING TO THE TO THE FUN EN EN THE ONLY WAY THEY'RE GOING TO DO THAT IS A YEAR IF THEY ATTRACT THE CAPITAL MARKETS IF THEY LOOK AND THEY SAY WE WANT TO PLAY BALL WITH CALIFORNIA NOW BECAUSE THEY'VE DONE. ALL THESE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU COME IN WELL THAT'S IT IT'S A VOLUNTARY ACTION BY PEACHY NEED THE SIGNALS TO THE CAPITAL MARKET IS THAT IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO PUT. A CAP ON DAMAGES LET'S JUST SAY WHAT IT IS THERE'S GONNA BE IT HOWEVER WE SLICE OF THIS PIE WE'RE GOING TO PUT A CAP ON DAMAGES AND THEY SAY OKAY. MY MONEY IS WORTH AS MUCH IN CALIFORNIA AS IT IS IN TEXAS OR IN RHODE ISLAND WHEREVER ELSE THE CAPITAL MARKETS INVEST INVESTORS AND THEN THE THE THE DEBTOR IN POSSESSION AT LEAST IN THE P. GENIE IS GOING TO SAY WE WANT. TO WE WANT TO EMERGE FROM BANKRUPTCY WE WE HAVE THE CERTAINTY NOW THE CALIFORNIA HAS. PRESCRIBED FOR US WITH THIS THIS PLAN THAT WE CAN ASK THE CAPITAL MARKETS PUT MORE VALUE INTO THE THE NEW DEBTOR AND WILL EMERGE AND THEN WE WILL. VOLUNTARILY PARTICIPATING YOU'RE OUT WILDFIRE FITNESS OF I DON'T SEE HOW ANY OTHER WAY TO DO IT. IT IS HARD TO SEE A SUSTAINABLE. SO. THE CAPITAL MARKETS HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE CAPITAL MARKETS AGREE WITH YOU SENATOR CASKEY THEY DO NOT SEE RIGHT NOW SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS MODEL. BOB IN THE UTILITY SPACE IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY PERCEIVE AS I'M ON LIMITED DOWNSIDE RISK. AND DID THAT THERE COULD THEY COULD WAKE UP YOU COULD INVEST TEN DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA YOU COULD WAKE UP ON SUNDAY IN SEPTEMBER AND FIND THAT THAT TEN DOLLARS IS WORTH ONE DOLLAR -- SO. WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT PERCEPTION. AT THE MINIMUM COST TO RATE PAYERS AND TO VICTIMS. AND I THINK THE UTILITIES AND THEIR SHAREHOLDERS AND THEIR BOND HOLDERS HAVE AN ENORMOUS INTEREST IN SEEING THAT PROBLEM SOLVED AS WELL. AND WE SHOULD ALL CONTRIBUTE TO A SOLUTION. I THINK ARE INVERSE CONDEMNATION IS WAS A LOVELY CONCEPT IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WHEN WE THOUGHT THAT SPREADING THE RISK AROUND MEANT PUTTING IT ON TO THE THE RATE PAYERS. WE'RE NOW IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND WE HAVE EMINENT DOMAIN WE HAVE EASEMENTS AND WE HAVE. INVERSE CONDEMNATION VAN THAT WE ALL LEARNED IN IN LAW SCHOOL BUT THE CLIMATE. I CHANGES AND ALL THESE OTHER FACTORS HAVE REALLY CHANGED THAT VARIABLE AND WE'VE TALKED AROUND AND ROUND OF WITH SPREADING THAT SOCIALIZING THAT WRIST YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS AT LEAST IN THE IN THE LAW OF HOW WE MAY. REDEFINE WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE UTILITIES. OUR POLLS ON YOUR PROPERTY IN A IN AN EASEMENT INVERSE -- EMINENT DOMAIN -- WORLD -- I THINK THERE ARE. WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT IF. INVERSE CONDEMNATION STAYS AS IT IS. ARE THERE IS A TREMENDOUS REWARD. FOR CREATIVE LAWYERS WHO CREATIVE PROPERTY LAWYERS WHO CAN THINK UP NEW WAYS TO SOLVE THE KIND OF NETWORK PROBLEMS. THAT UTILITIES HAVE HISTORICALLY SALT USING EASEMENTS. I'M USING UTILITY LINES MEN'S IN ANOTHER WAY THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE CONDEMNATION -- AND DOESN'T DOESN'T THEREFORE CREATE THIS PROBLEM. COM I AM NOT SURE WHAT THAT SOLUTION LOOKS LIKE -- BUT I IMAGINE THAT THERE ARE YOU KNOW THAT. THERE ARE [inaudible] IN PRACTICE. UTILITIES STRIVE TO AVOID CONDEMNING PROPERTY THEY TRY TO REACH AGREEMENTS SETTLEMENTS THAT DON'T INVOLVE ACTUAL USE OF EMINENT DOMAIN AUTHORITY -- THERE ARE PROBABLY OTHER CONTRACTUAL MODELS THAT WOULD AVOID THE INVERSE CONDEMNATION DOCTRINE THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE HAVE THE SYSTEM WE HAVE. AND IT'S BEEN BUILT USING THE POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN AND SO SUBJECT TO THE LAW THAT WE HAVE. THE CHARGES FOLLOW REQUEST LAST WORD SENATOR HERTZBERG AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO PUBLIC COMMENT. ON CENTER RECOUNTS THESE COMMENTS BECAUSE I WANT TO BUILD ON THAT BECAUSE I THINK YOU TOUCHED A NERVE HERE. THANKS IMPORTANT. ON YOU TALKED ABOUT THE COST OF THE INSURANCE MODEL VERSUS THE BRIDGE THE LOAN MODEL. AND NO QUESTION IS MORE EXPENSIVE WOULD YOU ASKED THEM MOST PROBATIVE QUESTION OF WHO PAYS. WHEN YOU TALKED EARLIER ABOUT ENTERPRISE VALUE WHAT WE HAVE HERE IN TERMS OF WHAT'S CLEAR IS WE HAVE RATE PAYERS ARE GOING TO PAY DOUBLE RETAIL? WE HAVE TAXPAYERS ARE GOING TO PAY DOUBLE RETAIL BUT WE HAVE THIS UNIQUE ENTERPRISE VALUE SYSTEM WHERE FOLKS IT PARTICULARLY P. JEAN OTHERS ARE LOOKING AT THIS WHERE WE KNOW WHAT A HEALTHY UTILITY. TRADES THAT WE KNOW WHAT OUR TRADES THAT WE KNOW WHAT THE WHAT THE WAS TRADING AT NOW WHETHER IT'S DEBT INSTRUMENTS FOR EQUITY INSTRUMENTS. THAT PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE THE COST OFF THE BOOKS OF THE RATE PAYERS OR TAX PAYERS. IF IT'S ELEGANTLY DRAFTED TO BE ABLE TO TO DEAL WITH THIS AND THE IDEA OF THE UNLIMITED DOWNSIDE RISKS TO WHICH CHORE TO CHELATED. IS GOING TO BE INFORMED BY AND AGGRESSIVE MITIGATION SIX TO ONE APPROACH THAT YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT THAT COULD BE PRETTY DRAMATIC SO I IN TERMS OF FIGURING OUT AS THE NINE A ONE YOUR COMMISSION TALKED ABOUT. OF THESE VERY IS KIND OF ELEMENTS WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO TAKE THOSE THOUGHTFUL ELEMENTS AND COBBLED THEM TOGETHER. IN AN APPROACH THAT DEALS WITH THE SENATE JACKSON TALKED ABOUT WOULD CENTER NIELSEN TALKED ABOUT WASN'T KOWSKI JUST TALKED ABOUT. INTO A WAY FORWARD AND THE THE THE COST ANALYSIS AND WHAT YOUR CONFIRMATION ON THIS IF I'M RIGHT ON CONFIRMATION IF I'M WRONG. TO MEDICALLY CHANGES BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT BECAUSE YOU HAVE PEOPLE THERE TRADING AT DEEP DISCOUNTS WHO DESPERATELY WANT TO PROTECT THEIR ASSETS. IN AND P. JEANNIE IN PARTICULAR AND WITH RESPECT TO THE LARGER PICTURE OF US GRADING HEALTHY UTILITY MODEL WITH THE WITH THE LESSON DOWNSIDE RISKS. THAT A GREAT OPPORTUNITY RESTS IN CAPTURING THAT ENTERPRISE VALUE TO THOSE INSTRUMENTS. I THINK THAT'S RIGHT RPG HAS SIGNIFICANT LIABILITIES OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE OF THE PARADISE -- CATASTROPHE. AND THE FIRES THAT OCCURRED IN NAPA AND SONOMA COUNTIES. BY THE REALITY IS THAT. I HEALTHY P. JEANNIE WOULD TRADE AT MULTIPLES OF ITS CURRENT VALUE. AND THE FIRMS THAT ARE INVESTING P. JEANNIE AT PRESENT ARE NOT TRADITIONAL UTILIY INVESTORS THEIR HEDGE FUNDS THAT ARE EVENT DRIVEN. AND ARE LOOKING AT THIS AS A OPPORTUNITY WITH SIGNIFICANT UPSIDE. AND I THINK IT IS REASONABLE TO ASK THAT IF THE STATE IS GOING TO CREATE THAT UPSIDE FOR THE SHAREHOLDERS APPEASING NEEDED TO SHAREHOLDERS SHARE SOME OF IT WITH THE STATE. GET CAPITA SIDE STATUTORILY IN TERMS OF THE IDEAS THAT WE WANT TO DO WE CAN REQUIRE GREATER CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE QUOTE THE FUNDS ARE GREATER CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE TO THAT WILDFIRE FUNDS THE INSURANCE FUND WE COULD CREATE A PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE PROTECTED IN THAT REGARD NOW. WE YES THE I THINK THE STATE COULD CONDITION ACCESS TO VARIOUS TOOLS LIKE A WILDFIRE FIND OR I DID A OF BETTER. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A SHAREHOLDER BETTER COST RECOVERY LOWER RISK COST RECOVERY FRAMEWORK. ON CERTAIN ACTIONS [inaudible] THIS WAR [inaudible] VERY MUCH. VERY DETAILED REPORTS -- FOR YOU AND YOU WOULD YOU PLEASE ALSO I KNOW -- STILL HERE BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR YEAH. SHE RIVETING YES -- BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT -- THE OTHER THREE COMMISSIONERS KNOW AND UNDERSTAND HOW HOW DEEPLY GRATEFUL WE ARE FOR YOUR SUBJECT EXPERTISE AND HELP US THROUGH THIS WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO OBVIOUSLY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU HAVE THE HARD PART. HELLO WE'VE GOT A PUBLIC COMMENT SO A ONE MINUTE EACH PLEASE COME FOR THANK YOU. PATRICK WHAT FOR THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING. THE OVER FORTY PUBLICLY AND ELECTRIC UTILITIES A PROVIDE ELECTRICITY. TWO ABOUT -- 25% OF THE STATE. HOLD ON ONE SECOND. THIS RESPOND IS BEING PAGED MR TECHNOLOGY [inaudible] PLEASE. PATRICK ROAD FOR THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION WE CONCUR WITH YOU AND AND YOUR THANKS TO MISSION IN THE COMMISSIONERS FOR THEIR WORK THEY HAVE PUT A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS IN FRONT OF YOU. I'M A LOT OF THEM THAT ARE INTERCONNECTED WE BELIEVE THE REPORT SHOULD BE LOOKED AT HOLISTICALLY. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE DISCUSSION OF STRICT LIABILITY SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE. ONE THAT IS DISCUSSED IN THIS COMMITTEE AND OTHER FORMS IN THE LEGISLATURE IN THE HEARING ON FRIDAY AT THE COMMISSION THERE SEEM TO BE BROAD AGREEMENT AMONG THE FIVE COMMISSIONERS THAT THAT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT POLICY ISSUE TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT FOR PUBLICLY AND UTILITIES -- WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT ANY SOLUTIONS THAT ARE PERFORMED RECOGNIZE UNIQUE NATURE OF EACH UTILITY ENERGY GRAPHICS SERVICE TERRITORY. AND LASTLY SOMETHING THAT'SCOME UP IN THIS HEARING SEVERAL TIMES S COSTS REPAIRS PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA JUST CAME OUT OF THE POLL IS AT EIGHT AND TEN ELECTRIC CUSTOMERS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT RISING RATES AS A RESULT OF WILDFIRE COSTS. NOT SOMETHING THAT IS DEFINITELY A FRIEND OF MINE FOR OUR MEMBERS WE LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE ENGAGING WITH YOU IN THIS PROCESS AND THANK YOU FOR TIME. THANK YOU NEXT SPEAKER. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS DIRECT OFTEN HAVE LEAD CALIFORNIA CITIES -- I'VE FIRST LIKE TO THANK THE COMMISSIONERS FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THE REPORT -- AS WE DISCUSSED WITH THEM ON FRIDAY THERE'S A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WE DO SUPPORT IN THAT HOWEVER WE DO DISAGREE WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS TO CHANGE THE STRICT LIABILITY STANDARD OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION TOOL FALL BASED STANDARD. I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE BY US SENATOR JACKSON AS WELL BY SAYING THAT WE THINK THAT THE KEEPING THE INVERSE CONDEMNATION STRICT LIABILITY STANDARD AT IS IS IS A REALLY GOOD INCENTIVE. FOR UTILITIES DOES TAKE THE NECESSARY STEPS TO MITIGATE AGAINST WILD FIRE RISK HOWEVER WE DO AGREE WITH THE COMMISSION THAT THOUGH STEP CURRENT STATUS QUO IS UNTENABLE AND SOMETHING NEEDS CHANGE. THAT'S WHY WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF THE CONCEPT OF A FUND IN ORDER TO STABILIZE UTILITIES AND MAKE SURE THAT WHILE FOR VICTIMS INCLUDING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE MADE WHOLE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AFTER THE FACT WERE -- COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR AND THE COMMISSION ON THIS AND ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO HELPING CRAP THOSE PROPOSALS IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU NEXT BIGGER. GOOD EVENING CZ HEAT RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA AND I'D LIKE TO BRIEFLY SO SEAT MAKE COMMENTS ON INVERSE CONDEMNATION WITH THAT TERRIBLE FEE FROM THE LEAGUE THAT JUST SPOKE. BUT I'M GONNA MOVE ONTO INSURANCE ANIMAL TO CHEAT A LITTLE BIT AND SAY THAT SENATORS MCGUIRE AND JACKSON PRETTY MUCH GAVE MY TESTIMONY ON THAT ALREADY AM THEIR COMMENTS WERE REALLY GREAT ON THAT. ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT LIVE IN RURAL COMMUNITIES RIGHT NOW WE pCOUNTIES AND I GET CALLS ON THIS ALMOST DAILY. ABOUT FOLKS THAT LIVE IN THESE AREAS THAT ARE BEING CANCELLED AND NON RENEWED. AND I WANT TO JUST REMEMBER THAT MAYBE IT'S ABOUT ONE IN EVERY TEN WILD FIRES THAT ARE CAUSED BY SOME SORT OF UTILITY OR OR ELECTRONIC ISSUE.
