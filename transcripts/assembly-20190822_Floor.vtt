OPPOSITION TO A CA FOR YOU KNOW

00:55:21.217 --> 00:55:23.820
I THINK THAT. LARGELY THIS IS

00:55:23.887 --> 00:55:27.857
BEING YOUR VEIL THAT SOMETHING

00:55:27.924 --> 00:55:30.560
THAT HELPS EXPAND THE FRANCHISE

00:55:30.627 --> 00:55:31.795
TO SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS BUT HAS

00:55:31.861 --> 00:55:34.330
BEEN MOSTLY A MORE POLITICAL

00:55:34.397 --> 00:55:34.931
ALTER YOUR MOTIVE IN THE LONG

00:55:34.998 --> 00:55:37.267
TERM. BECAUSE IF IT WERE REALLY

00:55:37.333 --> 00:55:41.504
TRUE. IF IT WERE REALLY TRUE

00:55:41.571 --> 00:55:42.138
THAT WE WANTED TO EXPAND VOTING

00:55:42.205 --> 00:55:45.642
TO CHILDREN. YOUR TO THOSE WHO

00:55:45.709 --> 00:55:48.211
ARE MINORS THEN WHY NOT DO THE

00:55:48.278 --> 00:55:49.879
WHOLE THING WHY NOT GO DOWN TO

00:55:49.946 --> 00:55:50.480
THIRTEEN YEAH. ONE I HAVE FIVE

AND GO AND VOTE. THE ONLY

00:56:01.091 --> 00:56:01.658
REASON THAT WE'RE DOING THIS IS

00:56:01.725 --> 00:56:05.862
BECAUSE. THE OTHER SOME DATA

00:56:05.929 --> 00:56:07.497
THAT MAYBE SHOWS THAT SEVENTEEN

00:56:07.564 --> 00:56:08.331
YEAR OLDS ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR

00:56:08.398 --> 00:56:11.134
THE MAJORITY PARTY AND INCREASE

00:56:11.201 --> 00:56:13.269
THEIR VOTE THRESHOLD IN THIS

00:56:13.336 --> 00:56:13.837
PRIMARY DAY TO INCREASE THAT

00:56:13.903 --> 00:56:16.873
THAT NUMBER. IN THIS CURRENT

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:17.474
PRIMARY I MEAN THAT'S WHAT IS

00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:19.843
REALLY GOING ON HERE. IT LOOKED

00:56:19.909 --> 00:56:20.443
AT THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE HAVE

00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:23.446
SAID. THAT THE AGE OF MAJORITY

00:56:23.513 --> 00:56:26.149
IS EIGHTEEN. AND THAT THAT IS

00:56:26.216 --> 00:56:29.819
WHEN EVERYONE. EVERYONE CAN

00:56:29.886 --> 00:56:33.389
VOTE WHEN THEY TURN EIGHTEEN.

00:56:33.456 --> 00:56:33.990
AND THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT HAVE

00:56:34.057 --> 00:56:35.892
REALLY CLOUDED THAT UP. IS THE

00:56:35.959 --> 00:56:38.161
MAJORITY PARTY IN THIS BUILDING.

00:56:38.228 --> 00:56:42.232
WHO WHO TELLS US THAT. YES

00:56:42.298 --> 00:56:42.832
SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS WE THINK

00:56:42.899 --> 00:56:44.300
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO VOTE BUT

00:56:44.367 --> 00:56:45.835
YOU'RE NOT ADULT ENOUGH TO BE

00:56:45.902 --> 00:56:47.537
ABLE TO DECIDE WHETHER NOT TO

00:56:47.604 --> 00:56:48.271
SMOKE. HE GOT AWAY TO YOUR

00:56:48.338 --> 00:56:52.575
TWENTY ONE. RIGHT. YEAH YOU'RE

00:56:52.642 --> 00:56:54.911
AN ADULT IN AT SEVENTEEN THEN

00:56:54.978 --> 00:56:56.813
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO VOTE AND

00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:57.413
MAKE DECISIONS. ON THE FUTURE

00:56:57.480 --> 00:56:58.782
OF OUR DEMOCRACY. BUT IF YOU

00:56:58.848 --> 00:57:02.085
HAPPEN TO KILL SOMEONE. THEY

00:57:02.152 --> 00:57:03.586
COMMITTED SERIOUS OFFENSE OR

00:57:03.653 --> 00:57:05.121
SUBMIT A SERIOUS CRIME AGAINST

00:57:05.188 --> 00:57:07.423
SOMEBODY NO WE THINK UNTIL

00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:08.091
YOU'RE TWENTY FIVE YOU'RE

00:57:08.158 --> 00:57:10.226
REALLY NOT ADULT ENOUGH AND

00:57:10.293 --> 00:57:12.262
RESPONSIBLE ENOUGH TO DO THAT

00:57:12.328 --> 00:57:12.796
THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT HAVE

00:57:12.862 --> 00:57:15.298
CONFUSE THIS ISSUE. IS THIS

00:57:15.365 --> 00:57:18.401
BODY OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS.

00:57:18.468 --> 00:57:21.404
SO EIGHTEEN HAS ALWAYS BEEN

00:57:21.471 --> 00:57:22.672

SHOULD BE ABLE TO VOTE THEN

00:57:26.910 --> 00:57:30.547
PROPOSE THAT. AND TAKE THAT TO

00:57:30.613 --> 00:57:31.781
THE VOTERS AND ASK THEM IF THEY

00:57:31.848 --> 00:57:33.283
WANT TO APPROVE THAT

00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:33.917

PREDICTIONS THAT YOU KNOW

00:58:53.096 --> 00:58:54.664
WESTERN CIVILIZATION WAS GOING

00:58:54.731 --> 00:58:56.032
TO FALL AND ALL KINDS OF BAD

00:58:56.099 --> 00:58:58.268

BILLS IN THE PAST THAT ACTUALLY

00:59:25.495 --> 00:59:27.230
REDUCE VOTING AGE TO SIXTEEN SO

00:59:27.297 --> 00:59:28.598
THIS IS SOMETHING I BELIEVE

00:59:28.665 --> 00:59:30.066
DEEPLY IN I THINK IT'S

00:59:30.133 --> 00:59:31.234

THIS IDEA. BUT THIS. THE

00:59:55.959 --> 00:59:59.128
SOLUTION IS NOT UNIQUE IT'S NOT

00:59:59.195 --> 01:00:02.932

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:25.989
POLITICAL PLAY GOING ON I THINK

01:00:26.055 --> 01:00:28.424

01:00:28.491 --> 01:00:30.059
THAT A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD WHO'S

THEIR FEET WET THIS IS THE MOST

01:00:34.297 --> 01:00:37.266
COMMON SENSE SHOULD BE EASY FOR

01:00:37.333 --> 01:00:38.968
ALL OF US TO UNDERSTAND WHY WE

01:00:39.035 --> 01:00:40.803

SOMEONE WHO WAS THE FIRST

01:03:57.567 --> 01:03:59.268
MILLENNIAL EVER ELECTED. TO THE

01:03:59.335 --> 01:04:01.571
CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE. I

01:04:01.637 --> 01:04:03.239
KNOW THE VALUE OF GETTING

01:04:03.306 --> 01:04:04.607
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE YOUNG

01:04:04.674 --> 01:04:05.841
ENGAGED AND OUR DEMOCRATIC

01:04:05.908 --> 01:04:08.511
PROCESS AT AN EARLY AGE I VOTED

01:04:08.578 --> 01:04:10.279
EVER SINCE I TURNED EIGHTEEN I

01:04:10.346 --> 01:04:11.714
WAS VERY PROUD TO CAST THAT

01:04:11.781 --> 01:04:14.483
VOTE I CONTINUE TO BE A VOTER

01:04:14.550 --> 01:04:15.084
EVER SINCE I CAST A FIRST VOTE

01:04:15.151 --> 01:04:15.685
AT THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN WHEN I

01:04:15.751 --> 01:04:17.286
COULD. BUT I ONLY DID IT

01:04:17.353 --> 01:04:19.188
BECAUSE AS I HAD A FAMILY THAT

01:04:19.255 --> 01:04:21.490
WAS INVOLVED IN POLITICS. AND

01:04:21.557 --> 01:04:22.892
IT WAS CONTINUE REALLY

01:04:22.959 --> 01:04:24.160
IMPRESSED UPON ME WHY IT'S

01:04:24.227 --> 01:04:26.229
IMPORTANT. TO BE ENGAGE IN OUR

01:04:26.295 --> 01:04:27.496
DEMOCRACY AND I JUST THINK IT'S

01:04:27.563 --> 01:04:28.965
A REALLY LAZY ARGUMENT. TO SEE

01:04:29.031 --> 01:04:30.399
HERE AND SAY THAT THE ONLY

01:04:30.466 --> 01:04:31.634
REASON WE'RE TRYING TO DO THIS.

01:04:31.701 --> 01:04:32.768
IS BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO EARN

01:04:32.835 --> 01:04:34.003
MORE OPEN MORE VOTERS ON OUR

01:04:34.070 --> 01:04:35.738
SITE ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE.

01:04:35.805 --> 01:04:37.006
BECAUSE IT COULD BE READ JUST

01:04:37.073 --> 01:04:39.175
AS EASY. TO SAY WELL MAYBE YOU

01:04:39.242 --> 01:04:41.310
DON'T WANT TO DO THIS. BECAUSE

01:04:41.377 --> 01:04:42.578
YOU RECOGNIZE THAT THEY'RE NOT

01:04:42.645 --> 01:04:43.613
GOING TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF YOU

01:04:43.679 --> 01:04:45.548
BECAUSE YOU CONTINUE TO DEVALUE

01:04:45.615 --> 01:04:47.817
THEM. AND THEIR PARTICIPATION

01:04:47.883 --> 01:04:50.052
IN OUR DEMOCRACY DEVALUE THEM

01:04:50.119 --> 01:04:52.054
AND THEIR IDEAS. ABOUT WHAT

01:04:52.121 --> 01:04:53.256
THEIR FUTURE SHOULD LOOK LIKE

01:04:53.322 --> 01:04:55.157
WHEN WE ARE CONSTANTLY EVERY

01:04:55.224 --> 01:04:56.392

THERE'LL THEIR LIVES. FOR ITS

01:04:59.295 --> 01:05:01.831
ENTIRETY. SO I THINK THAT WE

01:05:01.897 --> 01:05:04.600
NEED MORE PEOPLE VOTING MORE

01:05:04.667 --> 01:05:06.569
PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT IDEAS AND

01:05:06.636 --> 01:05:07.870
I JUST DON'T THINK THAT IT'S

01:05:07.937 --> 01:05:09.639
GOING TO BE NEGATIVE. WHEN YOU

01:05:09.705 --> 01:05:10.940
