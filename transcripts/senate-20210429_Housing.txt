HOUSING AND OTHER DEVELOPMENT THAT WE HAVE IN OUR VERY HIGH HIGH AND MODERATE FIRE SEVERITY ZONES- THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT WE'RE WE'RE BUILDING WE KNOW THAT THOSE DEBATES ON HOW LAND USE POLICY IS GOING TO IMPACT- WILDFIRE RISK AND WHILE WE TRY TO TACKLE THE HOUSING CRISIS WE KNOW THOSE ISSUES WILL BE DEBATED- THIS BILL THIS BILL IS MORE ABOUT- IN THOSE AREAS THAT ALREADY ARE BILLS. AND WHERE NEW DEVELOPMENTS TO OCCUR THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE HIGHEST QUALITY BUILDING STANDARDS THAT WE MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE STANDARDS WHEN IT COMES TO DEFENSIBLE SPACE PROTECTION AND WE HAVE ADEQUATE PROGRAMMING TO PROVIDE RESOURCES TO COMMUNITIES TO PROVIDE THE KIND OF CIVIC AND BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE NOT TO MENTION THE NATURE BASED INFRASTRUCTURE WE NEED TO GET THROUGH- THIS WILDFIRE YOUR. THAT IS IT IS JUST BEGUN. I THE PROGRAM. THAT WE WORKED OUT- IN THIS BILL WOULD. ADDRESS MUCH NEEDED FUNDING IN AREAS OF DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTION. AREA HOME HARDENING. YOU KNOW WE TOOK EARLY ACTION THIS YEAR IN OUR BUDGET AND THERE WAS SOME REALLY EXCITING WORK THAT HAPPENED BUT TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF HOW DAUNTING THE PROBLEM IT. THE ENTIRE HARDENING BUDGET THAT WE JUST AUTHORIZED THE GOVERNOR TO SIGN. WILL TACKLE ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND HOMES OUT THERE THE DESPERATELY NEED DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTIONS. THERE ARE MORE HOMES THAT NEED THOSE SAID I'D SAY MORE. A LOT OF THIS IS ON PRIVATE HOMEOWNERS TO DO THAT WORK. A LOT OF IT SHOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE FUNDED BY GOVERNMENT- BUT WE NEED A FRAMEWORK AND WE NEED STANDARDS TO GET THAT WORK DONE SO I'M HOPING WE CAN GET THIS BILL DONE THIS SESSION AND USE THIS INCREDIBLE COALITION. TO FIND SOME DURABLE CHANGE IN THIS AREA THAT I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE ON- THAT MEANS IN THE COALITION HERE'S THE FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION THE NATIONAL FIRE PROTECTION ASSOCIATION THE BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION CHAPARRAL INSTITUTE AND NUMEROUS ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS AS WELL AS PG&amp;E SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON- THIS BILL IS NO OPPOSITION SO THANK YOU FOR THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE LONG OPENING I KNOW YOU HAVE A BUSY HEARING.

IN THE PARADISE FIRE HOMES THAT MET THE WILL BE STANDARD HAD DEFENSIBLE SPACE HAD A SURVIVAL RATE THREE TO FOUR TIMES GREATER THAN THOSE THAT DID NOT WE ALREADY HAVE MAPS THE STATE VERY HIGH FIRE SEVERITY ZONE.

THEY SPEND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON SENDING BACK COUNTRY COURSE. STILL LOCKED TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED HOMES AND YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT PARADIS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE LOST ELEVEN THOUSAND HOMES OUT THERE. AND THE FIRE HAD MOVED THROUGH THIRTY THOUSAND ACRES OF TEN YEAR OLD VEGETATION OR HIT THE TOWN. AND SO THE THING THAT'S REALLY IMPACTING THESE. COMMUNITIES IT IS NOT. NECESSARILY THE WILDLAND VEGETATION OFTEN FAR AWAY FROM THE COMMUNITIES AT RISK BUT BUT THE NUMBERS. AND THE WIND DRIVEN EMBERS OF THE THINGS THAT- IMPACT ON THE MOST. AND SO CLEARING HABITAT NOT REALLY THE ANSWER- WHAT WE GOTTA DO IS STOP PUTTING NEW NEIGHBORHOOD IN HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS WHICH THIS BILL THAN A DOZEN CARS BUT- REPRESENT THE ONES THAT ARE AND A LOT OF LITTLE THINGS WE CAN DO- EMBER RESISTANT THAN NON FLAMMABLE ROOFING- PROPER DEFENSIBLE SPACE WHICH MEANS YOU DON'T REMOVE EVERYTHING'S IN THE DIRT YOU CREATE A- BIT OF- BARRIER FOR AMHERST AT THE HOUSE AND IT'S- ALL ABOUT THE EMBERS.

FIVE FIVE OKAY THAT HAS ENOUGH VOTES WILL PLACE AN ON CALL FOR ABSENT MEMBERS WE WILL NOW MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER TWO SENATOR EXCUSE ME SB FIVE SIXTY THREE BY SENATOR ALAN- CENTER ALLEN WELCOME AND YOU MAY PRESENTS WELL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BECAUSE I LIKE TO THINK THE CHAIR AND- HIS EXCELLENT STAFF FOR THEIR- FOR. FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE TO IMPROVE HIS LEGISLATION I'M VERY HAPPY TO ACCEPT AMENDMENTS AS OUTLINED IN. COMMENTS EIGHT AND NINE OF THE ANALYSIS AND I WANNA- PUBLICLY. COMMIT TO PARTNERING WITH THE COMMITTEE TO IMPROVE ACCOUNTABILITY AND DATA COLLECTION FRAMEWORK IN THE BILL. THAT IS AS DISGUSTING COMMENT TEN. TWENTY FIVE SIXTY THREE UPDATES AND IMPROVES UPON THE SECOND NEIGHBORHOOD INFILL FINANCING TRANSIT IMPROVEMENTS ACTS NIFTY TO. A VOLUNTARY TAX INCREMENT FINANCING TOOL TO CATALYZE AFFORDABLE. INFILL HOUSING NEAR TRANSIT AND CENTER IF YOU COULD MAYBE ADJUST THE MICROPHONE YOU'RE A LITTLE SOFT NOW OKAY GREAT THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. SO SAW THIS COMMITTEE NEWS IN THE WAKE OF REDEVELOPMENT'S DISSOLUTION THE LEGISLATURE HAS CREATED NUMEROUS INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING INSTRUMENTS THAT HAVE YET TO CATALYZES GRADUAL GROWTH. FIFTY TWO WAS ESTABLISHED IN CONSULTATION WITH THE HOUSING AND TRANSIT ADVOCATES TO PROVIDE CITIES AND COUNTIES. WITH A FINANCING TOOL THAT ESPECIALLY INCENTIVIZE THE DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION OF HOUSING AND TRANSIT ORIENTED. COMMUNITIES THE LEGISLATION THAT I'M OFF THE TOP THIRD. CREATING THE STATUE A FEW YEARS BACK ALSO REQUIRE THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH OPR TO STUDY AND REPORT ON THE EFFECTIVENESS. OF TAX INCREMENT TOOLS FOR INCREASING HOUSING PRODUCTION. SO OPS REPORT RELEASED EARLIER THIS YEAR. NOTES THAT LIMITED REVENUE POTENTIAL OF INCREMENTAL OF INCREMENT FINANCING TOOLS. QUOTE SIGNIFICANT LIMITS THEIR ABILITY TO ASSIST IN MEETING STATE HOUSING GOALS AND CELL FATE AND RECOMMENDED. AN EXPLORATION OF WAYS TO POTENTIALLY LEVERAGE EXISTING STATE PROGRAMS AND FUNDING SOURCES TO ENABLE THE USEOF FINANCING. NOT TO PROMOTE LOCATION EFFICIENT DEVELOPMENT AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN PLACES WHERE CURRENT INCREMENTS FINANCING TOOLS ALONE MAY BE INSUFFICIENT. SO THIS BILL IS INCORPORATED- PR'S RECOMMENDATION ENVISIONING A ROLE FOR POTENTIAL STATE FUNDING TO BOLSTER SHOULD CALL WITH CITIES AND COUNTIES A BUILDING INFILL HOUSING COMPLEMENTARY THE FIRST OPTION YOUR TRANSIT. IT ALSO STRENGTHENS NIFTY TEARS TENANT PROTECTIONS HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION INTO DISPLACEMENT PROVISIONS. ENSURING THAT DISTRICTS AUGMENT BUT NOT UNINTENTIONALLY UNDERMINE CALIFORNIA'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK. SO THE IDEA IS THAT BY ESTABLISHING A ROBUST FRAMEWORK FOR COLLABORATION AND CO INVESTMENT BETWEEN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ITS COUNTIES AND CITIES WHO WISH TO WILL WORK TOGETHER TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO PREVENT HOMELESSNESS. IN THEIR COMMUNITIES THIS BILL SB FIFTY SIX FIVE SIXTY THREE PROVIDES A MECHANISM THAT CAN MARSHAL MORE FINANCIAL RESOURCES THAN ANYONE LEVEL GOVERNMENT. I CAN PROVIDE A LOAN SO ON THE PHONE WITH ME TODAY I HAVE BEEN USING WHO IS SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF MY VALLEY AND SENATE CONSERVATIVES RIGHTS A CO SPONSORS. OF THIS LEGISLATION. THANK HI THERE CAN YOU CAN I CAN ARRANGE WE WILL NOW GO TO. ORDERS THAT SUPPORTS HER ANYTHING- MISTER ZANE YOU MAY PROCEED AND YES WE CAN HEAR YOU.

OUR AUTHORS ENTER ALLEN FOR HIS LEADERSHIP EFFORTS HERE WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE THE SUPPORT OF MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THE NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND CALIFORNIA'S PAR EXCEEDS THE RESOURCES. THAT CAN BE REASONABLY EXPECTED FROM ANY ONE LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT. DEVELOPING SUFFICIENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN MEETING THIS CHALLENGE AND THE CHALLENGE OF HOMELESSNESS WILL REQUIRE THAT CITIES COUNTIES AND STATES WORK TOGETHER IN PARTNERSHIP. AND FOR EACH TO BRING RESOURCES TO THE TABLE. SB FIVE SIX THREE CREATES A FRAMEWORK FOR PARTNERSHIP COLLABORATION CONVALESCENT BETWEEN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT'S COUNTIES AND CITIES WHEN THEY WISH TO WORK TOGETHER TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND TO PREVENT PREVENT HOMELESSNESS. SB FIVE SIXTY THREE ENABLES THE CITY AND COUNTY THE CONTINENT RAIMENT DEFORMING NEXT TO TWO TAX INCREMENT DISTRICT NEAR TRANSIT. WHICH CAN BEST PROPERTY TAX INCREMENT IN THE DISTRICT SO LONG AS 40% OF THE TOTAL RESOURCES ARE INVESTED IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING. FOR HOMELESS PREVENTION. THEY CITY AND MAKES A GREAT. SB FIVE THREE. OF THE STATE. OF CALIFORNIA WILL PUT. FUNDS TO MATCH HOW OF THE FUNDS OF THE CITY AND COUNTY- COMBINED AFFORDABLE HOUSING RESOURCES BUT ONLY. IF THE LEGISLATURE HAS ALREADY APPROPRIATED FUNDS FOR THIS PURPOSE AND WITHIN THE LIMITS OF WHAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATED. WE ARE PLEASED TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENT SUGGESTED BY THE CHAIR. AND LOCATES RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPMENT OF PROGRAM GUIDELINES AND IMPLEMENTATION AT H. C. D. SB FIVE SIX THREE. FIVE SIX THREE RESPECTS THE ORIGINAL THAT THE TWO LEGISLATIONS COMMITMENT. SUCH DISTRICTS TO FUND PROJECTS IN NEAR PROXIMITY TO TRANSIT SERVICE IN ORDER THAT THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. BUT SHE'S DEVELOPING REDUCTIONS ON THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS WHICH HAVE BECOME AN IMPORTANT PART OF STATE POLICY- IT ALSO RESPECTS THE TEAM'S CURRENT COMMITMENT THAT 10% OF TOTAL RESOURCES- BUDGET SHOULD BE INVESTED IN URBAN GREENING AND FIRST LAST MILE. PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE TO HELP CREATE ATTRACTED BURDENS. NEIGHBORHOODS WITH EASY ACCESS TO TRANSIT. THESE OBJECTIVES ARE ALL CONSISTENT WITH STATE OF CALIFORNIA OBJECTORS REFLECTED IN THE POLICIES GUIDE IN THE USE OF GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FONG. SB FIVE SIXTY THREE ALSO INCORPORATES A COMMITMENT TO SKILLED AND TRAINED LABOR POLICIES. WE REGARD SUCH COMMITMENT NOT AS A BURDEN BUT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REFLECT CALIFORNIA'S COMMITMENT TO JUST LABOR POLICIES. AND TO BRING THE FAMILY OF LABOR INTO THE COALITION CHAMPION IN ROBUST RESOURCES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE VERY MUCH IN THE CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR.

FOR SAID LIKE SAY WE GREATLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S INTENT TO GROW RESOURCES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS- WE CONSIDER THE AUTHOR TO CHAMPION FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL CAN EFFECTIVELY CONTAINS A UNION ONLY CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENT. THAT THE RENDERS THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING RELATIVELY USELESS. AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER SEE A BENEFIT EMPLOYEE UNION MEMBERS BUT THIS ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT IGNORE THE REALITIES OF THE WORKPLACE. OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER COMMUNITY RIGHT NOW HAS A LOOK ST DIFFICULTY GETTING THREE BIDS FOR ANY JOB WITH THE PREVAILING WAGE REQUIREMENT. AND THAT'S WHEN AND BOTH UNION AND NONUNION CONTRACTORS OR APPLYING ARE BIDDING. THIS IS THIS- A DIFFICULT IS PARTICULARLY PRONOUNCED IN INLAND AREAS WHERE WE ARE LIKELY TO GET. WHERE I'M LIKE WE'RE LIKELY TO BITS ONLY- WE ARE NOT LIKELY TO GET BIDS FROM ANY UNION CONTRACTORS AT ALL. THIS BILL THIS BILL DISQUALIFIES HALF THE WORK FORCE IN WHICH CASE THE DEVELOPERS WILL BE UNABLE TO GET ANY BIDS OR BE SUBJECT TO THE MARKET POWER OF A SINGLE BIDDER. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE BUILDING TRADES RELEASED A REPORT STATED AMONG OTHER THINGS CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO DOUBLE OR TRIPLE ITS WORKFORCE EMPLOYED IN NEW HOUSING CONSTRUCTION. AND% EXPANDING A PRODUCTIVE RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION WORK FORCE AS RAPIDLY AS REQUIRED% WILL BE A SPECIALLY CHALLENGING DUE TO COMPETITION FROM NON RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION EMPLOYERS. AS A RESULT THE UNION ONLY LANGUAGE WILL RENDER THE BILL RELATIVELY USELESS IN MOST PARTS OF THE STATE. AND MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE THAN OTHER PARTS UNTIL WE CAN GROW THAT WORK FORCE WHICH WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE TRADES ON. AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMMUNITY HAS OFFERED AMENDMENTS THAT WILL PRIORITIZE AND GROWN UNION LABOR WHILE ALSO PUTTING RESPONSIBLE GUARDRAILS IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT FOUR WHEEL HOUSING CAN MOVE FORWARD AT A REASONABLE COST.

THAT HAS ENOUGH PHOTO FOR ON CALL TO THE ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU SENATOR. OKAY WE WILL NOW GO TO ITEM SEVEN SB SIX- CENTER CABALLERO- WILL BE PRESENTING FROM HER DESK. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PER PRESENT SB SIX THE NEIGHBORHOOD HOMES ACT. AS YOU RE ALL AWARE CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO FACE AN EXTREME HOUSING CRISIS IN ORDER TO MEET THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS FAMILY THE STATE MUST INCREASE HOUSING PRODUCTION. YET THE LACK OF AVAILABLE LAND FOR RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT CONTINUES TO BE A BARRIER TO BUILD. MANY OF OUR CITIES ARE BUILT OUT AND DON'T HAVE. AVAILABLE VACANT LAND IN OTHER CITIES ARE RELUCTANT RELUCTANT TO DEVELOP HOUSING ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THEIR JURISDICTION WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO URBAN SPRAWL AND GREENHOUSE GASES. SB SIX TAKES THE CONCEPT ARTICULATED IN SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE THIS IS BEING ABLE COMMUNITY STRATEGY. TO REDUCE THE TIME AND DISTANCE PEOPLE TRAVEL BY VEHICLE AND THE REUSE AND ADAPT. UNDERPERFORMING PROPERTIES TO CREATE WALKABLE COMMUNITIES AND AVOID SPRAWL THIS ADAPTIVE REUSE BILL WILL SPUR HOUSING PRODUCTION BY AUTHORIZING RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS ON EXISTING LOTS CURRENTLY ZONED FOR COMMERCIAL OFFICE AND RETAIL USE. SUCH AS STRIP MALLS. LARGE MALLS OR BIG BOX RETAIL SPACES SB SIX WILL ALSO SOLVE AND INVOLVING CRISIS THAT HAS BEEN EXACERBATED BY THE SHELTER IN PLACE ORDERS DURING THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC. WHICH IS WHICH HAS SHIFTED BUSINESSES TO ACCEPT SOME PERMANENTLY NEW WORK FROM HOME STRATEGIES AND EXPANDED ONLINE TRANSACTIONS FOR CONSUMER RETAIL. NUMEROUS MAJOR COMMERCIAL TENANTS HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY MAY BE FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY RELIEF ARE CLOSING STORES DUE TO THE DECLINE IN SALES SALES AT PHYSICAL STORE LOCATIONS SUCH AS SEARS J. C. PENNEY'S KMART AND TOYS R. US AND MANY OTHERS. WE'VE SEEN THE SHIFT IN CONSUMER PREFERENCE OVER TIME WHICH HAS LEFT MANY COMMUNITIES WITH STRIP MALLS AND MALLS WITH MAJOR TENANT BACON SEES WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO THE DECLINE OF THE RETAIL CENTER INCREASING BLIGHT. VANDALISM AND DECLINING SALES REVENUES IN MY RURAL DISTRICT THESE RETAILERS ARE OUR MAJOR TENANTS AND I EXPECT TO SEE MANY MORE LEAVES AS THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE. MANY CORPORATE ENTERPRISES ARE FOR GOING THEIR BRICK AND MORTAR OPERATIONS IN FAVOR OF A NEW WORK FROM HOME REALITY. TECH GIANTS SUCH AS FACEBOOK HAVE EMBRACED A PERMANENT WORK FROM HOME STRATEGY LEAVING BEHIND MASSIVE COMMERCIAL CENTERS WITH UNCERTAIN FUTURES. THESE UNDER UTILIZED FOR VACANT COMMERCIAL SPACES ARE ALONG MAJOR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION ROUTES AND CONTAINS SIX SIGNIFICANT ACREAGE AVAILABLE TO BE DEVELOPED FOR MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT TO CREATE A WALKABLE LIVE WORK PLAY VILLAGE. THE WALKABLE VILLAGE CON CON SUPPORT WILL ALSO HELP TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY CREATING THE OPPORTUNITY TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED- TWO ERRANDS. WITHIN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY WHICH CAN BE ACCESSED THROUGH WALKING MOST SIMPLY SB SIX WILL SPUR HOUSING PRODUCTION BY ALLOWING AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE ALLOWING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. TO APPROVE RESIDENTIAL OR MIXED USE DEVELOP ON COMMERCIAL ZONED RETAILER SPACES. BY UTILIZING AN EXPEDITED PROCESS REQUIRE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT MEET OR EXCEED THE DENSITY DEEMED APPROPRIATE TO ACCOMMODATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUCH AS APARTMENTS TOWN HOMES AND CONDOMINIUMS. AND PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY FOR LOCAL DECISION MAKING BY SUBJECTING DEVELOPMENT TO LOCAL PLANNING PARKING AND DESIGN. ORDINANCES WITH NO COST TO THE STATE SB SIX WILL INCENTIVIZE RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS WITHOUT IMPACTING SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS BY GIVING LANDOWNERS AND DEVELOPERS AWAY TO MEET THE GROWING DEMAND FOR HOUSING THIS BILL WILL ALSO SPUR ECONOMIC ACTIVITY A CRITICAL COMPONENT TO ECONOMIC RECOVERY. DURING THIS PAN SESSION TO QUOTE THE GOOD SENATOR FROM BERKELEY IN REGION'S MOST NEED IN NEED OF REVITALIZATION AND IS A STEP FORWARD TOWARDS ECONOMIC TRANSFERRED TRANSFORMATION I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.

HELLO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IN THANK YOU- RIGHT HE'S FALLING. THANK YOU SENATOR- CAREER FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE FOR WE RECEIVED A LOT OF SUPPORT FROM OUR FOR MY DISTRICT- WITH REGARDS TO THIS BILL BUT I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AS FAR AS- SIMILAR DISCUSSIONS AS TO IF THERE'S BEEN ANY CONSIDERATION AT IN PLACING. RESIDENTIAL UNITS WITHIN INDUSTRIAL AREAS AND HEALTH- IN THE LONG TERM AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS- I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE AS REAL TORS WE ARE SUPPOSED TO DISCLOSE ALL OF THE AREAS YOU HAVE B. IF A PROPERTY IS WITHIN A CERTAIN AREA OF AN AIRPORT WITHIN A CERTAIN AREA OF FARMLAND. AND JUST OF PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT ENTAILS. WHAT THE ENVIRONMENT WILL ENTAIL AND THAT AND- HEY WE ALSO HEAR QUITE A BIT AND I'VE HEARD THAT FROM SEVERAL GROUPS. THE CONCERNS THAT PEOPLE HAVE WHEN THEY- HAVE- SAY WERE HOUSES BEING UILT NEARBY RESIDENTIAL AREAS AND HOW THAT AFFECTS THEIR- THERE CAN THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE FOR OTHER INDUSTRIAL AREAS COMING INTO A CROUCHING INTO THE RESIDENTIAL AREAS AND NOW WE ARE. WITH THIS BILL. TRYING TO APPROVE AB DE ABILITY TO. BUILD RESIDENTIAL HOMES- IN INDUSTRIAL AREAS- FOR AN EXAMPLE I'M JUST CURIOUS AS TO HAS THERE BEEN ANY CONSIDERATION OR HER. OUR TALKS ABOUT WHAT THAT IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE IN THE LONG RUN FOR THESE- INDUSTRIES THAT ARE THERE WHAT'S GOING TO TAKE PRIVATE IF THE HEALTH OF THE- THE PEOPLE LIVING IN CHOOSING TO LIVE HERE. OR THESE- ENTITIES THAT WILL HAVE TO RELOCATE- YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT YOUR MIND. THIRTY THROUGH THE CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH A SENATOR FOR THAT THOSE QUESTIONS LET ME JUST SAY THAT- I CAME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND SO I SPENT FIFTEEN YEARS IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND I HAVE A- A REAL COMMITMENT. TO PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THEIR LOCAL CONTROL SO THAT'S NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO IS THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM PROHIBITS ANY DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSING ADJACENT TO AN INDUSTRIAL AREA AND- I RECEIVED A LETTER- OF IT WITHIN THE PAST WEEK FROM RC RC THE URBAN COUNTIES IN C. SECTOR HAVE SOME REALLY GOOD- SUGGESTIONS IN TERMS OF CLARIFYING LANGUAGE TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR. THAT THERE MAY BE SOME PARCELS THAT ARE COMMERCIAL THAT INCLUDE INDUSTRIAL PARK A COMMERCIAL THAT INCLUDE- THE KINDS OF ZONING THAT YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO PUT HOUSING NEXT TO AND WILL MAKE IT VERY CEAR THAT WE DON'T INTEND THAT TO HAPPEN THAT'S NOT THE INTENTION OF THE BILL THE BILL IS. PERMISSIBLE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THEY CAN IDENTIFY THE SITES THAT THEY BELIEVE WILL BE MOST APPROPRIATE FOR HOUSING THEY WILL KNOW WHO WHAT SITES THEY ARE BECAUSE THE STORES ARE CLOSING THIS IS NOT AN ATTEMPT. TO CLOSE. BUSINESSES THAT ARE SUCCESSFUL. AND TO REPLACE THE- THE LOT WITH HOUSING THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE AN INVESTMENT IN A SHOPPING CENTER. IN THE COMMERCIALS OWN THAT WILL ALLOW HOUSING TO BE PART OF THE OF THE MIXED USE IN THE ZONE- AND SO WE'LL BE VERY CAREFUL TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DOESN'T- CONFLICT WITH OTHER LAND USES THAT WOULD CREATE A DANGER. BY PUTTING HOUSING NEXT TO IT. AND SO THEY WERE WORKING TOMORROW NIGHT AND THE LANGUAGE WILL BE WILL WILL WILL WILL WILL YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT YOU'LL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY SEE IT. WONDERFUL THANK YOU. HEY AT WORK ANYTHING ELSE CENTER TROUBLE. THANK YOU BYE CENTER PATEL'S A- THE PROCORE THROUGH THE BILL I'D BE HAPPY TO MOVE IT AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME.

IN TERMS OF WORK FROM HOME AND WHAT THAT MIGHT MEAN FOR COMMERCIALS HE SAYS- AND THERE MAY BE COMMERCIAL PLANS THAT YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC AND WORK FROM HOME. MAY NO LONGER. BE AS NEAT AS A ONCE BEFORE I DO I DO THIS WHEN I SAYS MY OWN VIEW THAT FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN I THINK THAT. THAT MAY NOT BE A SIGNIFICANT A FACTOR AS WE SOMETIMES THINK IMMERSING IN THE BAY AREA EVEN FACEBOOK GOOGLE ARE CONTINUING. TO EXPAND- EVEN AS THEY HAVE MORE FLEXIBLE WORK FROM HOME- I DO THIS BILL EVEN PRE PANDEMIC- THIS BILL WOULD BE INCREDIBLY USEFUL UNIFICATION NUMBER CAT AND- HAPPEN BECAUSE THE REALITY IS WE HAVE A LOT OF LAND DAWSON BAY AREA BUT- IN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- THAT'S EITHER UNDER PERFORMING. ARTS US NOT BEING DEVELOPED AS COMMERCIAL EVEN THOUGH ITS OWN NOT WHEN WHAT THIS BILL DOES. IS IT CREATES A FACILITATOR WAY JUST TO CREATE FLEXIBILITY SO BEYOND THE ETERNAL DEBATES OR PARK AND HAVE FOR YEARS AND YEARS ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF THE PANDEMIC ON ONE WORK IN OFFICE ETCETERA. I THINK THIS BILL IS INCREDIBLY USEFUL- AND HAVING THAT GREATER FLEXIBILITY AND SO I'M PROUD TO SUPPORT IT- SO- WITH THAT- CENTER CAREER YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY THAT I TESTIFIED HERE TODAY APPRECIATE THEIR COMMENTS AND CONCERNS- BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WE KNOW WE pTO DO IT IN A WAY THAT'S RESPONSIBLE THAT HAS AS- LITTLE IMPACT ON THE NEIGHBORHOODS AS POSSIBLE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS DOES. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU. WITHOUT AMOUNT OF. YOU MAY CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS BILL SIX BUT KERR THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE RE REFER TO THE CA ON APPROPRIATE.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND- EVERYONE I EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO THE COMMITTEE OF FOR BEING WILLING TO CROSS AS COMMITTEE AMENDS SOME AUTHOR AMENDMENTS. THAT- I AM- ATTY ST STE BESIDES TECHNICAL CLEAN UP THOSE DEMANDS AND ALL GET INTO THE TECHNICAL CLEAN UP A LITTLE LATER THOSE IMMENSE CLARIFY. THAT ENTIRE DISPLACEMENT PROTECTIONS APPLY TO LOWER INCOME OCCUPANTS AND EXCLUDE SHORT TERM RENTALS. AND NOW TO THE BILL SB EIGHT SO HE WENT TO STATE YOUR PAST SB THREE THIRTY IN TWENTY. NINETEEN AND THAT BILL THREE THIRTY WHICH THE GOVERNOR SIGNED INTO LAW HAS REALLY ASSISTED THE CALIFORNIA IN GETTING MORE HOUSING BUILT. THE BILL HAS A VERY I THINK OUR- PRACTICAL BUT ESSENTIAL PURPOSE WHICH IS THAT IT HELPS TO GREENLIGHT THOSE HOUSING PROJECTS THAT MEET OUR EXISTING RULES NOW WE ALREADY HAVE OTHER STATUTES ON THE BOOK THAT HELPS TO DO THAT HOWEVER. WE WATCHED THAT PROJECTS WERE MOVING FORWARD AND THEN A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WOULD CHANGE ITS RULES WHICH THEN WOULD EITHER ELIMINATE THE BILL WOULD BE FOR THAT HOUSING PROJECT WHICH PREVIOUSLY MET THE RULES TO GO FORWARD OR GREATLY DELAY IT. ON SO WHAT SB THREE THIRTY DID AND WHAT I WILL EXPLAIN SB EIGHT DOES IS SB THREE THIRTY SAID LOOK WE'RE IN A CRISIS RIGHT NOW LET'S JUST TAKE A PAUSE AND LET'S. STOP CHANGING THE RULES FOR FIVE YEARS LET'S STOP CHANGING THE RULES LET'S HOLD OFF ON ACTIONS THAT DELAY OR DECREASE HOUSING YOU KNOW OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERS AND ALLOW THOSE HOT THAT HOUSING WHICH WE HAD ALREADY WE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. HAVE ACCEPTED AND SAID WAS MEET OUR ROLES LET'S LET HIM GO FORWARD. NOW BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC AS WE ALL KNOW MANY THINGS HAVE BEEN HALTED. SO WHAT SB EIGHT DOES IS IT EXTENDS THE LIFE OF SB THREE THIRTY SO S. THREE THIRTY AS I MENTIONED WAS JUST YOU KNOW GIVE US FIVE YEARS TO TRY TO ACCELERATE THE HOUSING THAT MEETS OUR RULES. BUT BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC PAUSE WHAT I WANT TO DO AND I ASK YOU TO JOIN ME TO DO IS EXTEND THE PROVISIONS OF SB THREE THIRTY UNTIL TWENTY THIRTY SO IT WOULD STILL EXPIRED IT WOULD STILL GO AWAY BUT WE WOULD AT LEAST BE ABLE TO FOR THAT PERIOD OF TIME. HAVE OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT HOUSING THAT MEETS THEIR RULES AND NOT CHANGE THE RULES MIDSTREAM AND NOT TAKE ACTIONS THAT DECREASE OR DELAYED HOUSES. NOW THE FEW CHANGES TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS THAT WE'VE INCLUDED THIS THAT ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT'S IN THREE THIRTY ARE THAT WE LOOK HER FOR LOW GUY IN THE TO YOU THAT THREE THREE A BEEN OP. THAT THE WERE FEW. THAT WERE. IN PERHAPS THE HARD TO IN THE SO WE BE SOME FOR A MEMBER TO DEATH. AND AROUND THE OF LOW AND CAN UNITS SO THAT THE BILL NOT THIS.

I WANT TO THANK YOU GUYS CENTER SKINNER FOR HERVERY VERY HARD WORK. ON SB THREE THIRTY- I MEAN THAT WAS A LONG AND COMPLICATED. PROCESS BUT THIS BILL HAS BEEN DESCRIBED- THIS LAW SHOULD SAYS BEEN DESCRIBED AS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND IMPACTFUL HOUSING LAWS IN. RECENT YEARS IT IS FUNDAMENTALLY A GOOD GOVERNMENT- LAW TO SAYING YOU CAN HAVE WHATEVER RULES YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE- BUT HE CAN BE WE NEED TO MOVE AWAY FROM. CALIFORNIA'S TYPICAL ROPE A DOPE- A HOUSING PROCESS WHERE IT'S OF SUCH TURBULENT UNPREDICTABLE AN OPEN ENDED PROCESS AND TO SET SOME GUARDRAILS SO THERE'S A BEGINNING MIDDLE AND END. OF THE PROCESS AND I THINK SB THREE THIRTY DOES NOT VERY GRACEFULLY- AND- THIS LEGISLATION AND MAKING SYSTEM NEEDED CLARIFICATIONS- AND EXTENDING THE SUNSET I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT SO I SUPPORT THE BILL- AND- I KNOW THAT THERE ARE. ACTUALLY THERE ARE AMENDMENTS AND I CAN'T REMEMBER IF YOU ACCEPTED THE AMOUNT I DID YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR OKAY WITHOUT WE DO HAVE A- MOTION MY CENTER CORTEZ THE AND CENTER IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE. THANKS SO MUCH- AND APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS- BY THE CHAIR AND- I DIDN'T SAY THIS IN THE REASONS. WHY THIS BILL SO IMPORTANT BUT I THINK. WHAT I MEAN BEYOND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A- CRISIS WE HAVEN'T FOR. CRISIS AND WE KNOW. THAT THE LADY'S DASH COST. DELAY MAKES HOUSING MORE EXPENSIVE AND IT MAKES IT LESS AFFORDABLE SO AS WE HEARD FROM THE KEY WITNESS IN SUPPORT OF THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AS MUCH AS WE HEAR FROM SO MANY CONSTITUENTS HOW MUCH THEY SUPPORT ONLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IT IS ACTUALLY OUR AFFORDABLE PROJECTS THAT TAKE THE LONGEST TIME TO GET THROUGH THE PROCESS. SO IN FACT WHAT IS THE EXTENSION OF OUR HOUSING CRISIS ACT BY ALLOWING THOSE. HOUSING PROJECTS THAT MEET THE RULES TO MOVE FASTER THROUGH THE PROCESS IT WILL ACTUALLY HELP GET US THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS FASTER AND WITH THAT I ASKED FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. GREAT THANK YOU- WE HAVE A MOTION ON S. B. AIDS ANDS LEARNING CONSULTANT COULD PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

BOND FOR THE FIRST TEN WELL YOU ARE NOT THE WINNER OF THE MIKE WEIR HONORARY AWARD I THINK SENATOR WHITE CAL SKI IS GOING TO WIN THAT AWARD TODAY SO CONGRATULATIONS. ON NOT WINNING THAT AWARD. THANK YOU SO MUCH- MISTER CHAIR AT THE CENTER MY CASKET I'VE BEEN BUDGETS OF TWO AND A VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT. I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU BY LUNCH I EACH TIME FOR THE AWARD WINNERS SO YOU ONLY IF YOU WANT TO. HAVE SO I THINK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR INTO THE COMMITTEE. I'M GRATEFUL TO BE HERE TODAY I WANT TO START OFF BYSAYING I'M ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. TO CLARIFY THAT THE BILL ONLY APPLIES TO VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES. INTO TIED THE BILL THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN OFF THE PLANE RESEARCH TECHNICAL ADVISORY. MEMBERS I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO HAVE MUCH OF A CONVERSATION REGARDING THE UNPRECEDENTED TIMES THAT. WE'RE LIVING IN WHEN IT WHEN IT COMES TO WILDFIRES THAT THINK WERE IN AGREEMENT. THAT THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF WILDFIRES IN THE STATE HAVE CHANGED THE FACE OF CALIFORNIA FOREVER. THE LARGER THE MORE DESTRUCTIVE. THEY'RE DEADLIER NOW THE NAME EVER BEEN IN MODERN HISTORY. THE TWENTY TWENTY WILDFIRE SEASON BURNED MORE THAN FOUR POINT TWO. MILLION ACRES. MAKING IT BY FAR THE LARGEST IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. EIGHT OF THE TEN LARGEST WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. OCCURRED INTHE PAST TEN YEARS. FOUR OUT OF THE FIVE LARGEST WILDFIRES. HAPPENED LAST YEAR ALONE. THIS INCLUDES THE OBVIOUS COMPLEX FIRE WHICH BURNED OVER ONE MILLION ACRES IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ON THE NORTH COAST. MAKING IT THE FIRST FIRE IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY TO BURN OVER ONE MILLION ACRES. OF GORGEOUS FORCING. AND WE ALL REMEMBER THE CAMPFIRE NEW NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHICH TRAGICALLY BECAUSE THE DEATHS OF EIGHTY SIX PEOPLE. DESTROYED NINETEEN THOUSAND STRUCTURES. WHAT ABOUT THE NORTH BAY FIRESTORM. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN DOZENS OF LIVES WERE LOST. ALONG WITH OVER SIX THOUSAND HOMES. IN IN EACH OF THESE MAJOR FIRES TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS RAN FOR THEIR LIVES. MANY TIMES IN THE DARK OF NIGHT. THE WAY WE STRATEGICALLY GROW GROW OUR COMMUNITIES HAS ALSO COME INTO QUESTION IS THE REALITY OF MAKE A FIRE HAVE SITTING HERE THE GOLDEN STATE. WE KNOW THAT THE DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES IN HIGH RISK AREAS MUST CHANGE. AND IF THEY DON'T BEING VERY CANDID MORE DEATH. AND DESTRUCTION WILL FOLLOW. IN FACT THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE HAS ALREADY INTERVENED WITH LAWSUITS AND THREE LARGE LARGE DEVELOPMENTS. HI TECHS IN THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE BECAUSE OF WILDFIRE IMPACTS. THE NEW NORMAL HERE IN THE GOLDEN STATE. IT'S HERE AND IT'S NOT GOING AWAY WHICH IS WHY WE ADVANCE SB TWELVE THIS BILL SETS A MINIMUM FLOOR FOR DEVELOPMENTS IN THE WILD IN URBAN AIR INTERFACE CURRENT STATE STANDARDS ARE LIMITED TO THE BUILDING CODE. IN REQUIREMENTS FOR ROAD SIGNS IN FUEL BREAKS S. B. TWELVE SET UP A TRANSFORMATIONAL PROCESS FOR THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL TO ESTABLISH BOLD NEW STANDARDS. THAT ENSURES DEVELOPMENTS AS A WHOLE ARE DESIGNED DESIGNED TO WITHSTAND WILDFIRE NOT JUST THE BUILDINGS WITHIN THOSE DEVELOPMENTS I WANT TO GIVE YOU A COUPLE EXAMPLES WHAT THE STANDARDS MAY INCLUDE. A WILDFIRE OF WILDLAND FIRE HAZARD ASSESSMENT IN WILDFIRE HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN STANDARDS FOR THE ORGANIZATION DEPLOYMENT OF FIRE SUPPRESSION OPERATIONS. LOCATION CONSTRUCTION OF INFRASTRUCTURE TO REDUCED IGNITION POTENTIAL ENSURE AVAILABILITY OF WATER ESSENTIAL FOR FIRE SUPPRESSION DURING A WILDFIRE DEFENSIBLE SPACE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND FUEL MODIFICATION REQUIREMENTS IN AN ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM ESTABLISHED FUNDED AND IMPLEMENTED. TO VERIFY ONGOING COMPLAINTS BACK BY FINANCING MECHANISMS SUCH AS H. AWAY FUNDS SITE SPECIFIC SAFETY MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT THE DEVELOPMENT AS A WHOLE IS PLANT IS CURRENTLY CONSTRUCTED TO RESISTING CULTURING OF UNCONTROLLED FIRE. DEVELOPMENT LAYOUT DEVELOPMENT LAYOUT THAT REDUCES WILDFIRE RISK. TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE. BLUNTLY PUT THIS LEGISLATION THAT IF DEVELOPMENT CAN'T MEET STANDARD. LOCALS SHOULD NOT APPROVED. BUT WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. THE STANDARDS ARE TIERED SET THE STANDARDS INCREASINGLY STRONGER AS DEVELOPMENTS GROW LARGER IN THOSE HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES THE REASON IS THIS LARGER DEVELOPMENTS PUT MORE PEOPLE INTO THE WORLD. AND SO THEY MUST MEET HIGHER STANDARDS AND SMALLER DEVELOPMENTS THIS MEANS THAT THE REQUIREMENTS ARE STRINGENT BUT NOT SO COSTLY AS TO TOTALLY PREVENT DEVELOPMENT WHICH BY THE WAY IS A SIGNIFICAN AND THEN IN. THAT WE ARE TAKING AFTER FEEDBACK FROM GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S OFFICE. AND WE KNOW THAT HALF OF THE BUILDINGS LOST OVER THE LAST DECADE WERE IN THE WILL BE. BUILT UNDER CURRENT FIRE CODES. THIS BILL ALSO ENHANCES THE PLANNING THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MUST DO INCLUDING TO COME UP WITH A STRATEGY TO RETROFIT EXISTING BUILDINGS. NOW THERE ARE SOME THERE'S SOME HOPE TO DO ABOUT THIS BILL BUT I LIKE TO BE A TO TALK ABOUT THE FACTS. THIS BILL IS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO A BILL THAT WAS APPROVED BY A BIPARTISAN MAJORITY IN BOTH HOUSES AND SENT TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK. LIKE  SAID WE MADE AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS THE GOVERNOR'S CONCERNS. MANY MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE SUPPORTED. NEARLY AN IDENTICAL BILL SB ONE EIGHTY TWO LAST YEAR. THE PROPONENTS ON THIS BILL WERE NEUTRAL ON THE LEGISLATION WHICH IS NEARLY IDENTICAL LAST YEAR. AND OTHER CONCERNS THIS YEAR ARE WITH THE PROVISIONS THE BILL THAT ARE THE SAME PROVISIONS THAT WERE CONTAINED IN THE BILL LAST YEAR. SO WHAT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO IS THIS. WE BELIEVE THAT SB TWELVE SB TWELVE WILL SAVE LIVES SB TWELVE SAYS THAT THE WILDFIRE RISK REDUCTION REDUCTION STANDARDS MUST BE QUOTE.REASONABLE FEASIBLE AND ACHIEVABLE FOR THE MAJORITY OF DEVELOPMENTS IN EACH CATEGORY. THIS ISN'T A QUESTION OF INTERPRETATION IT'S BLACK AND WHITE. IN THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL MUST GO THROUGH THE FULL FORMAL RULE MAKING PROCESS TO DEVELOP THE STANDARDS. I AM IN INDIA RIGHT HERE IN SAY THIS. THAT WE HAVE BEEN MEETING WITH OPPOSITION FOR THE CAST PASSED SEVERAL MONTHS. YOU HAVE MIGHT ONE HUNDRED AND 10% PROMISE RING TO CONTINUE TO MEET WITH OPPOSITION. IN NEGOTIATE IN GOOD FAITH AS I ALWAYS DO FOR THE PAST SIX YEARS IN THIS LEGISLATURE. WELL WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO REACH FULL AGREEMENT YET. WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE CONTINUE TO NEGOTIATE IN GOOD FAITH. THIS IS THE THIRD YEAR OF THIS BILL IN THE LEGISLATURE. IN SB ONE EIGHTY TWO IS THE ONLY BILL THAT POUND SB TWELVE IS THE ONLY BILL THAT BALANCES THE NEED FOR NEW HOUSING EVEN IN THE WILL BE WITH FIRE SAFETY. AT THE BILL MEMBERS IS SUPPORTED BY THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA FIRE CHIEFS CALIFORNIA FIRE DISTRICTS. THE NATIONAL FIRE PROTECTION ASSOCIATION AND OTHERS. EMERG GRATEFUL THAT WE HAVE WARRANTED. DEFENSE DEVELOPMENTS HERE ON THE LINE WITH THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION. AS WELL AS CHIEF DANCE THE FINAL HE'S THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION. MISTER CHAIR I APOLOGIZE BUT GOING ON TO LONG WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE IN.

AND THEN- CHIEF DOWN SOPRANO FROM THE FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION AND COST COSTA MESA FIRE DEPARTMENT- SO- AGAIN IT'S TWO MINUTES EACH ABOUT FOUR MINUTES TOTAL SO- THE FIRST WITNESS SHOULD BE MINDFUL. NOT TO EAT INTO THE SECOND WITNESSES TWO MINUTES. ARMS START WITH- LAUREN DILLON ZERO FOLLOWED BY MUCH YOU SEVERAL. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS AREN'T ABLE AND REPRESENTS THE PLANNING. PLEASE BAKER AND OR THAT THE TWELVE WHICH WILL MAKE A NUMBER COMPANIES CHANGES OCCUR PLAN FOR AND FROM DEVELOPMENT AND HIGH RISK AREAS. WE ALREADY KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA IS LIKELY TO FACE ANOTHER VERY CHALLENGING WILDFIRE SEASON PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF THE RECORD DRY CONDITIONS AND DROUGHT EMERGENCY CONDITION- AND BADLY AS SENATOR REQUIRE HAS THAT CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO FACE RECORD. BREAKING DESTRUCTIVE AND DEADLY FIRES THAT HAVE BECOME THE STATE IN NORMAL BILLING TURNED WE BELIEVE THAT JURISDICTION'S WILL NEED TO DO MORE TO BETTER PREPARE AND PLANNING FOR CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCY HAVE LONG BEEN ON THE TOP OF MIND FOR THE PLANNING PROFESSION AND OVER THE YEARS IT'S BECOME CLEAR THAT BOLD NEW STEPS NEED TO BE TAKEN TO BETTER PREPARE OUR COMMUNITY UNLIGHTED BUOYS. INSURTECH RECORD SETTING WILDFIRES THAT MEANS THAT WE CASTING A LAND USE PLANNING IS DONE IN THE WHAT HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS BUILDING RESILIENT HOME AND ENSURING THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE SUPPORTED WITH GUIDANCE AND FUNDING ARE ALL CRITICAL STUFF THAT ARE NEEDED. EIGHTY CALIFORNIANS THEM. OF A WHILE REDUCTION. AND REQUIRE THE BILL ENSURE THAT IT. HOME PARDONS YOU DEVELOPMENTS ARE. CONSIDERED AN PREPARE. WE ALSO BELIEVE AT THE- HELLO HOUSING PRIORITIES FOR MARC. HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES APPROPRIATE DESIGNED COMMUNITY AND HE'S FIRE AREA. AB ONE POP. DIRECTLY INTO THE LEFT HAS AREAS WITHIN A- ALL OF THIS WILL MEAN THE STATE'S HOUSING. TARGETS FOR EACH REGION TO ENSURE THE NEED TO DEVELOP A PLEASE NOT HOUSING ARE BEING DEVELOPED IN THE COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT. AND FINALLY WE BELIEVE THAT THE REQUIRE. APPLE'S LIVE LOCAL THE FACT THAT LOCAL AND- STANDARDS. FUNDING OR ALL PEOPLE WILL BE THERE'S STILL ACCEPTING. PLANNING MUST BE DONE NOW TO HOMES AND LOW. BY PROVIDING FOR MORE. COMMUNITIES WE REALLY APPRECIATE REQUIRE AFTER WHILE THE CHAIR AND THE- ON THAT. AND LOOK FORWARD TO ASKING BILL AFTER HEARING THE IT THE BACKUP. MICHAEL YOUNG. NEXT IN. OF THIS CHIEF DOWN STEP BY. YES WELL THANK YOU IN AFTERNOON TO AND MEMBER OF THE COULD MY NAME IS DAN TO FOLLOW CHIEF FOR THE CITY BECAUSE TO ME AND PRESS OF THE FOR CHIEFS. IT AGAIN WANT TO THANK SENATOR FOR EFFORTS- THEY ARE OF. AS WE ARE ALL TO CALIFORNIA HAS A LARGEST MOST IS WILDFIRE THE WILDFIRES OVER THE LAST DECADE DEVASTATED COMMUNITIES LARGE AND SMALL. MILLIONS OF HOMES FACE SERIOUS RISK OF DESTRUCTION FROM WILDFIRE. AND THIS NUMBER CONTINUES TO RISE AS WE ATTEMPT TO BUILD OURSELVES OUT OF THE STATE'S HOUSING SHORTAGE. AS WE WORK COLLABORATIVELY TO ADDRESS THE STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS WE MUST KEEP THE SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITIES. PUTTING OUR FIREFIGHTERS AND FIRST RESPONDERS FRONT AND CENTER WE SIMPLY CANNOT CONTINUE BUSINESS AS USUAL IN THIS SPACE. SB TWELVE TAKES THE NECESSARY AND HOLISTIC APPROACH NEEDED TO ENSURE CALIFORNIA BUILT SAFELY. THE BILL REQUIRES THE STATE FARM MARSHAL'S OFFICE TO DEVELOP COMPREHENSIVE TIERED WILDFIRE RISK REDUCTION STANDARDS FOR DEVELOPMENTS IN OUR STATE'S MOST FIRE PRONE AREAS AS CENTER CENTER REQUIRE ARTICULATED. THE CITY STANDARDS WHICH WOULD BE REQUIRED TO BE MET BEFORE LOCAL APPROVAL THE DEVELOPMENT INCLUDE PROVISIONS SUCH AS EMERGENCY INGRESS AND EGRESS ROUTES. FIREBREAKS DEFENSIBLE SPACE MAINTENANCE AND VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WHICH IS ALL ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. THIS WILL ALSO MOVES BEYOND THE CURRENT STATE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK WHICH IS FOCUSED ON INDIVIDUAL STRUCTURES AND LOOKS MORE BROADLY AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL IMPACTS OF WILDFIRE. SB TWELVE DOES NOT PROHIBIT LOCAL AGENCIES FROM APPROVING NEW DEVELOPMENT. BUT INSTEAD REQUIRES STRINGENT YET WORKABLE STANDARDS AND NECESSARY PART TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS IN OUR NEW NORMAL OF YOUR LONG FIRE SEASON. FINALLY THE BILL ESTABLISHES A GRANT PROGRAM FOR JURISDICTIONS TO HELP PAY FOR THE PLANNING EFFORTS INCLUDED IN THE BILL. IN CLOSING I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. AND WE STRONGLY URGE YOU TO SUPPORT SB TWELVE. THANK YOU.

ARE SINCERE AND RIGHT IN THEIR EXTREME CONCERNED THAT WE GET THIS WRONG. IT COULD BE DEVASTATING TO THE STATE PIPELINE OF PROJECTS NOT ONLY THE PROJECT AND READY TO BE BUILT. THE PROJECT THAT REPRESENT THE DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE THAT ARE DECADES PLUS IN DEVELOPMENT AND REPRESENT WHAT IS OUT THERE FOR THE FUTURE. OUR MEMBERS BUILD EIGHTY PLUS PERCENT OF ALL THE HOUSING IN THE STATE. AND THEIR PROJECTS GET DERAILED IT'S NOT AN EXAGGERATION TO SAY THAT THERE WILL NOT BE NEED FOR HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR CALIFORNIANS IN THOSE PROJECTS INCLUDE. SINGLE FAMILY MULTI FAMILY AND AFFORDABLE PROJECTS. WHILE ONE MAIN CONCERN CONTINUES TO BE AROUND THE ROLE OF PR AND THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN THIS PROCESS. THE MORE TIME YOU SPEND THIS BILL AND RECEIVE I IT IS BEEN YEARS BUT- NOT FOR WHAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PEEL BACK.

SUCH AS LACK OF CAPACITY IN FINANCING EXPERTISE THE PAST FEW YEARS THE LEGISLATURE ADMINISTRATION OF SET THE GROUNDWORK FOR UTILIZING UNUSED PUBLIC LAND TO PROMOTE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT FOR EXAMPLE. GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S EXECUTIVE ORDER IN TWENTY NINETEEN CREATED A SMALL TEAM OF STAFF TO FACILITATE THE CONSTRUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON APPROPRIATE STATE OWNED ACCESS LAND. ADDITIONALLY RECENT PASS LEGISLATION REQUIRES EACH CITY AND COUNTY TO REPORT TO H. C. D. AN INVENTORY OF A SURPLUS LANDS OF BY THIS MONTH. SINCE THESE MEASURES HAVE BEEN IN PLACE HCD HAS BEEN OVERWHELMED WITH CALLS FROM LOCAL AGENCIES ASKING FOR ASSISTANCE IN DISPOSING OF THE SURPLUS LAND.

CALIFORNIA SURPLUS LANDS ACTORS PRIORITY TO DEVELOPMENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON THESE PARCELS. MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HOWEVER HAVE MINIMAL CAPACITY OR EXPERTISE TO ISSUE AND EVALUATE REQUESTS FOR PROPOSALS OR NEGOTIATE SALE OR LEASE AGREEMENTS WITH DEVELOPERS.

IN OPPOSITION- TO THE BILL TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT WOULD LEAD TO CONSTRUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITHOUT KEEPING THE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS IN MIND WE ARE CONCERNED- WE ARE CLOSED TODAY THANK YOU. TURN ON THE OTHER LINES IN Q. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ME ABOUT THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS COLLEAGUES. SEEING NINE DOING THE MOTION. I DID. THE MOTION BY SEN I WANTED TO ASK A QUESTION I'M SORRY I'M SORRY I'M I'M CURIOUS IN TERMS OF THE CURRENT PRIORITY THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE FOR ON THEIR SURPLUS LAND DOES INCLUDE PARK AND RECREATION- PARK RECREATION OPEN SPACE AND I'M THINKING WITH A LOT OF THE IRVINE INFILL ARE HAVING THE URBAN PARKS FOR EXAMPLE WOULD SEEM TO ME TO BE SOMETHING VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND NOT TO BE SAAS. A SUBORDINATE. MORE ON MULTI FAMILY ON HOUSING AND IT. I AM CONCERNED THAT THIS WOULD NOT ALLOW THAT DISCUSSION FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE SURPLUS PROPERTY BOB FRANKLY THAT NINETY FIVE COME ABOUT BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC AND ALL THE INABILITY TO SUSTAIN SOME OF THE AREAS ESPECIALLY LOOK THE COMMERCIAL AREAS THAT HAVE GONE ON A KIND OF DORMANT. THEY MAY BE SENATOR CORTEZ HE CAN ADDRESS THAT CONVERT IT IS TRULY A- SIGNIFICANT CONCERN IN SOME OF THE NORTH ORANGE COUNTY. URBAN AREAS WHICH DON'T HAVE PARKS AND DON'T HAVE THAT- YOU KNOW SAFE ACCESS TO SCHOOLS THAT FEDERAL THAT FROM OF THE DEVELOPMENT NEEDS TO BE VERY. CONCERNED ABOUT AND VERY ACCOMMODATING I'VE- GO AHEAD A GREAT QUESTION THANK YOU FOR ASKING IT TO ALLOW ME TO CLARIFY SO THE BILL IS- A VOLUNTARY- WOULD CREATE A VOLUNTARY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN- ANY LOCAL. AGENCY OR GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY- SEEKING ASSISTANCE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION ON THEIR SURPLUS LAND OR LAND THEY WOULD EXPECT TO DECLARE SURPLUS. WITHOUT IMPOSING ANY REQUIREMENT- THERE'S NOTHING IN THE BILL THAT IMPOSES ANY REQUIREMENTS AS TO HOW THE USER SURPLUS LAND- SO THEY WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE THE DECISION BEFORE CONTACTING THE STATE- THAT THEY HAD DESIGNS ON BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING- PERHAPS YOU KNOW THROW UP THEIR HANDS SO TO SOME DEGREE AND SAY BUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT. AT WHICH POINT THEY MAKE THE CALL- AND WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS MAKE SURE WHEN THEY MAKE THAT CALL- THEY REALLY GET HE HELP THAT THEY NEED WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO HELP THEM. BUT WE HAVE FOR EXAMPLE- A PIECE OF PROPERTY THAT'S LONG BEEN TO COURT SURPLUS ON A LIGHT RAIL LINE AND MY DISTRICT- I'M SURE THERE'S MANY SUCH SITUATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WERE HIGH DENSITY RESIDENTIAL FOR MORE RESIDENTIAL WOULD BE ALLOWED BY GENERAL PLAN- BUT IT'S OWNED. BY A LOCAL AGENCY THAT- ISN'T FAMILIAR WITH DEVELOPING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THEY ALSO HAPPEN TO BE ADJACENT TO A MAJOR REGIONAL PARKS SO THEY CAN MAKE THE DECISION. THAT ALL THAT GOES TO PARK. ALL THE GIRLS WERE FOR HOUSING OR SOME GOES TO BOTH. OR MAYBE THE SHIFT GEARS ENTIRELY DECIDED TO BUILD A SHOPPING CENTER OR SOMETHING ON THAT SITE- THIS BILL JUST SAYS IF YOU CHOOSE AFFORDABLE HOUSING- WE'RE HERE TO HELP YOU- IT BUT- NO MANDATE THAT YOU ACTUALLY MAKE THAT CHOICE. IS NOT A MANDATE AND I. A HOPE THAT IT HELPS ANSWER THE QUESTION. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OKAY CAN I HAVE- THREE OF A MOTION ON SB SEVEN NINETY ONE. PERHAPS BY SENATOR CONWAY ARE OR ON BURKE. MOTIONS BY CENTER ON BURKE. OKAY CENTER YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND JUST TO CLARIFY- I THINK- I TRY TO THINK EXTENSIVELY- COMMITTEE STUFF FOR MR SURE YOUR STUFF HERE ON THE COMMITTEE FOR THE SISTINE THOUGH OPPORTUNITY SINGLE OUT AARON THIS BILL WAS ORIGINALLY- AS THE ORIGINAL ARE AND THE RESULT DRAFTING OF THE BILL- HAD AN EMPHASIS ON FUNDING AND OBVIOUSLY WE'RE STATE FUNDING. WOULD BE INVOLVED- THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS WE LIKELY WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE BILL IN TERMS OF WORKFORCE% PROTECTIONS ETCETERA- WE TOOK THE FUNDING. OF LANGUAGE OUT OF THE BILL AND THE BILL IS SIMPLY A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BILL AT THIS POINT I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT FOR THE RECORD I WASN'T. ENTIRELY SURE- ON THE OPPOSITION LINE WHAT I WAS HEARING BUT I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT- THAT THAT SPOKESPERSON UNDERSTOOD THAT THE BILL WAS A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BILL NOW- IT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE. A PLACE TO PUT- FUNDING WORKFORCE- PROTECTIONS OR THOSE KINDS OF THINGS IN IT- AT THIS POINT ALTHOUGH- CLEARLY- AT ONE TIME AN EARLIER VERSION OF THE BILL DID SO. AGAIN FOR THE RECORD- THAT SHOULD BE A NON ISSUE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR. YOUR VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR ARE WE HAVE A MOTION. AND MATTER CONSULTANCY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE SENATE BILL SEVEN NINETY ONE BY SENATOR CORTEZ THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION SENATOR WIENER AYE WIENER AYE BATES. AYE BATES AYE CABALLERO HI COPYRIGHT COURTESY. CURTIS HE AYE MCGUIRE. A CHORE BOOK. SKINNER NUMBER HI NUMBER FIVE WITH CASKEY. FIVE ZERO THAT HAS BEEN A VOCAL CURRENT CALL FOR UP TO MEMBERS- BEFORE WE GO TO LESS BILL- IF FIVE- HOUSING COMMITTEE SEPARATIST ALERT ABSENT MEMBERS THAT WE ARE ON OUR LAST BILL AND THEY SHOULD AT SOME POINT SOON MAKE THEIR WAY ON TO THE LIFTING F THE CALLS- FOR ITEM NUMBER TWELVE THAT IS MY BILL IS BEFORE SEVENTY EIGHT I'M GONNA- AND THE PROVERBIAL OF THE- CARE GAVEL. OVER TO OUR VICE CHAIR. SENATOR BATES. AND YOU ARE READY SENATOR WIFE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MADAM OR SIR I'M CALLING. SENATE BILL FOUR SEVENTY EIGHT- IS A FAIRLY TECHNICAL- BILL AND WHAT IT DOES IS IT MAKES MAKE SURE THAT WHEN A CITY HAS OWNED. FOR SMALL ZONE LOCALLY FOR SMALL MULTI UNIT THREE TO TEN UNIT BUILDINGS- THAT PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY ABLE TO BUILD THOSE BUILDINGS- I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THIS BILL HAS NO APPLICATION. AREAS THAT ARE ZONED FOR SINGLE FAMILY HOMES- NOT EVEN FOR DUPLEXES THE BILL ONLY APPLIES. IF THE CITY HAS DETERMINED LOCALLY. TO DO ZONING TO ALLOW- BUILDINGS BETWEEN THREE AND TEN UNITS- AND THE WHITE HOT WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW IN A NUMBER OF CITIES. IS THE CITY WILL ZONE THROUGH ITS PLANNING CODE OR GENERAL PLAN FOR SMALL MULTI UNIT THREE FOUR SIX EIGHT TEN- AND THEN AT THE SAME TIME. IMPOSE HARSH SQUARE FOOTAGE REQUIREMENTS KNOWN AS F. A. R. FLOOR AREA RATIO. THAT MAKE IT EFFECTIVELY IMPOSSIBLE. TO BUILD TO THAT ZONING. SO EXAMPLE IF A CITY ZONES. AN AREA LOCALLY AT FOUR UNITS TO SAY YOU CAN BUILD A FOUR UNIT BUILDING- ON THIS PARCEL AND THEN IT DOES NOT SAY IT'S A THREE THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT LIVE AND THE CITY AT THE SAME TIME IMPOSES A VERY HARSH POINT THREE F. A. R. WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THE TOTAL SQUARE FOOTAGE OF THAT BUILDING. WOULD BE LIMITED TO NINE HUNDRED SQUARE FEET WHEN YOU DIVIDE THAT BY FOUR THAT'S TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE SQUARE FEET. PER UNIT NO ONE IS GOING TO BUILD THAT- AND IN FACT I BELIEVE THAT IS- IT MIGHT NOT ACTUALLY EVEN BE LEGAL IN TERMS OF THE SIZE OF THE UNIT BEING SO SMALL BUT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO GET BUILT AND SO EFFECTIVELY THAT IS THE CITY. HAVING BASICALLY FAKE ZONING THE SALE ON PAPER REZONING FOR FOUR UNITS OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE BUT BECAUSE OF THESE OTHER SQUARE FOOTAGE ARBITRARY REQUIREMENTS IT'S ACTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO BUILD ABOUT ZONING- THAT IS BAD GOVERNMENT- AND WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT SAYS TO CITIES ONCE YOU HAVE VOLUNTARILY LOCALLY ZONED FOR SMALL MULTI UNIT. YOU CAN NOT IMPOSE OTHER RESTRICTIONS THAT EFFECTIVELY GIVE WITH ONE HAND AND TAKE WITH THE OTHER IT HOSTIN DESIGNING HAS TO MEAN SOMETHING WANT TO BE CLEAR DOESN'T APPLY TO SINGLE FAMILY THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE OUR ZONING THIS ONLY APPLIES TO THE CITY GETS A SET ITS OWN LOCAL ZONING IN THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE THE NUMBER BILL UNITS YOU'RE ALLOWED TO BILLS THE BILL DOES NOT CHANGE THE HEIGHT. LIMIT THAT'S A LOCAL IT DOESN'T CHANGE SETBACKS DOESN'T CHANGE DESIGN STANDARDS AND I GOT A DOESN'T EVEN APPLY IN AREAS THAT ARE ZONED. SINGLE FAMILY. THE ANSWER WHAT IT DOES IS IF YOU HAVE OWN LOCAL. BETWEEN AND SO YEAR- THE APP ARE WILL BE ONE POINT OH AND I WANT TO KNOW. THAT ONCE THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO RECENTLY ZONED ITS ENTIRE CITY FOR FOUR UNITS FOR CLOCKS- SACRAMENTO UPDATED ITS FLOOR AREA RATIO TO BE ONE POINT NO. BECAUSE IT'S LOWER FLOOR AREA RATIO THAT HAD EXISTED WOULD HAVE MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO ACTUALLY BUILD. FOUR PLEXUS- AND SEVERED WHAT WE'RE DOINGIS IN LINE WITH WHAT- YOU KNOW OTHER CITIES OF DOMINICK DUNNE THIS VOLUNTARILY- AND THEN FOR BUILDINGS THAT ARE EIGHT TO TEN UNIT C. F. A. R. WOULD BE ONE POINT TWO. FIVE SO THIS WILL SIMPLY ENABLE PEOPLE TO BUILD. TO THE DENSITY THAT THE CITY HAS DETERMINED IT WANTS LOCALLY THE OTHER PIECE OF THE BILL- HAS TO DO WITH A PARCEL SIZES THAT IF. CITIES HAVE MINIMUM LOT SIZES BUT IF YOU HAVE A NONCONFORMING LOT SIZE SAYS A PRE EXISTED- THEM THE CITY'S MODERN ZONING- THAT THE CITY COULD NOT USE THAT AS A BASIS TO THE NIGHT- PROJECT. ON SO COLLEAGUES THIS IS FUNDAMENTALLY A GOOD GOVERNMENT- LAW THAT RESPECTS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF LOCAL CONTROL- BUT IS SIMPLY REQUIRING CITIES TO DO WHAT THEY SAY- THEY SUPPOSEDLY- DOING AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK. OUR FOREIGN RIVALS WHO ARE WITH ME TODAY TESTIFIED- ARE LUIS MERON TODAY FROM CALIFORNIA YIMBY. AND MICHAEL. LANE FROM SPUR. THANK YOU SAID. THAT ARE YOU CALL HE LEAVES WITH.
