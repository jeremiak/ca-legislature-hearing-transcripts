00:33:53.798 --> 00:33:55.900
STRATEGICALLY VERY BAD THING TO

00:33:55.967 --> 00:34:00.371

00:34:30.768 --> 00:34:33.271
LAW FOR FIFTEEN YEARS AND-

00:34:33.337 --> 00:34:35.807
CONDUCTED- FIFTEEN- JURY

00:34:35.873 --> 00:34:37.909
TRIALS- THEY WERE NOT CRIMINAL

00:34:37.975 --> 00:34:39.977
THEY WERE CIVIL- BUT I'VE- I

00:34:40.044 --> 00:34:41.646
PICTURE IS AND I'VE SEEN THE

00:34:41.712 --> 00:34:43.681
GOOD AND THE BAD AND THE UGLY

00:34:43.748 --> 00:34:45.716
ABOUT HOW JURIES ARE SELECTED.

00:34:45.783 --> 00:34:48.719
ON AS A AS A TRIAL ATTORNEY I

00:34:48.786 --> 00:34:49.487
ALWAYS LOVED PEREMPTORY

00:34:49.554 --> 00:34:51.522
CHALLENGES BECAUSE IT GAVE ME A

00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:53.291
SENSE THAT I HAD SOME SORT OF

00:34:53.357 --> 00:34:56.427
CONTROL HOWEVER I LEARNED OVER

00:34:56.494 --> 00:34:58.529
TIME THAT THESE PEREMPTORY

00:34:58.596 --> 00:35:00.498
CHALLENGES ACTUALLY DIDN'T GIVE

00:35:00.565 --> 00:35:02.934
ME THAT MUCH CONTROL BECAUSE

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.936
PRESS THREE CHALLENGE DURING

00:35:05.002 --> 00:35:08.773
HER EARLY BASED ON. STEREOTYPES

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:10.441
PEOPLE. AND I'D BEEN TALK THERE

00:35:10.508 --> 00:35:11.008
WERE TIMES WHEN I WOULD STAY

00:35:11.075 --> 00:35:12.477
SOMEONE. OF A JURY AND FIND OUT

00:35:12.543 --> 00:35:13.311
LATER THAT THEY PROBABLY

00:35:13.377 --> 00:35:14.312
WOULDN'T REALLY SYMPATHETIC

00:35:14.378 --> 00:35:16.414
RIGHT DIDN'T STRIKE SOMEONE AND

00:35:16.481 --> 00:35:17.415
IT TURNED OUT THAT THEY WERE A

00:35:17.482 --> 00:35:20.218
NIGHTMARE FOR ME- ON THE JURY-

00:35:20.284 --> 00:35:22.019
AND SO WE END UP REALLY USING A

00:35:22.086 --> 00:35:24.288
LOT OF STEREOTYPES ON WHEN WE

00:35:24.355 --> 00:35:25.289
EXERCISE PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES.

00:35:25.356 --> 00:35:26.924
THEY DO HAVE VALUE BECAUSE

00:35:26.991 --> 00:35:29.293
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN JUDGES-

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.562
MAKE MISTAKES- WHEN A JUDGE

00:35:31.629 --> 00:35:33.831
SAID EXCUSE SOMEONE- FOR

00:35:33.898 --> 00:35:35.633
BECAUSE AND DOESN'T. AND THAT'S

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:37.869
WHY THEY EXISTS AND SALAS THIS

00:35:37.935 --> 00:35:41.572
BILL IS TAKING ON. HI I DO

00:35:41.639 --> 00:35:42.740
BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL STRIKES

00:35:42.807 --> 00:35:45.109
A GOOD. BALANCE BY RETAINING

00:35:45.176 --> 00:35:47.411
PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES- BUT

00:35:47.478 --> 00:35:49.680
ALLOWING THEM TO MASS WITH THE

00:35:49.747 --> 00:35:51.916
ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE- AND

00:35:51.983 --> 00:35:53.351
UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT THEY

00:35:53.417 --> 00:35:55.353
ARE NOT AS VALUABLE. AS SOME

00:35:55.419 --> 00:35:59.190
PEOPLE SOMETIMES BELIEVE- SO I

00:35:59.257 --> 00:36:00.558
ALSO AS FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK

00:36:52.577 --> 00:36:54.145
REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN

AND OUR WILDFIRES AND WHAT WE

00:51:09.633 --> 00:51:11.802
DISCOVERED IS THAT EVEN THOUGH

00:51:11.868 --> 00:51:14.004
MOST OF THESE FACILITIES ARE

00:51:14.070 --> 00:51:17.207
FEDERALLY- LICENSED WITH THE

00:51:17.274 --> 00:51:19.743
REQUIREMENT THAT THEY HAVE

00:51:19.810 --> 00:51:21.077
NINETY SIX HOURS OF BACK UP

00:51:27.384 --> 00:51:31.087

00:51:31.154 --> 00:51:33.156
PERCENTAGE. OF CALIFORNIA

00:51:33.223 --> 00:51:35.225

00:51:37.994 --> 00:51:39.763
IN FACT THEY ONLY PROVIDE SIX

00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:43.066
HOURS. NOW EVEN IN THOSE

00:51:43.133 --> 00:51:44.935
FACILITIES THAT ARE FEDERALLY

00:51:45.001 --> 00:51:47.838
LICENSED THERE IS A QUESTION.

00:51:47.904 --> 00:51:50.307
OF AMONGST THOSE FEDERAL-

00:51:50.373 --> 00:51:54.478

REQUIREMENTS WERE NOT BEING MET

00:52:09.526 --> 00:52:11.061
AND SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS

00:52:11.127 --> 00:52:13.129
IT REQUIRES THE STATE OF

00:52:13.196 --> 00:52:16.066
CALIFORNIA. TO APPLY AND TO

00:52:16.132 --> 00:52:18.368

MANDATE INTO STATE LAW AND OUR

00:52:20.604 --> 00:52:21.738
HOPE IS OF COURSE THAT WILL

00:52:21.805 --> 00:52:23.039
START SEEING THIS BETTER

00:52:23.106 --> 00:52:25.275
IMPLEMENTED WHEN YOU THINK OF

THE IN THE COVERT REALITY IN

00:52:35.619 --> 00:52:38.188
WHICH WE LIVE AND THE FACT THAT

00:52:38.255 --> 00:52:38.922
IT'S DIFFICULT IF NOT

00:52:38.989 --> 00:52:41.358
IMPOSSIBLE TO ACTUALLY EVAC BUT

00:52:41.424 --> 00:52:43.827
THESE PEOPLE ARE WHEN THERE IS

SURVIVE THAT'S ALL THIS BILL

00:52:56.306 --> 00:52:59.543

THE AMOUNT OF TIME TO NINETY

00:53:01.645 --> 00:53:04.080

00:53:52.696 --> 00:53:54.097
ELDERLY AND WAS FRAIL

00:53:54.164 --> 00:53:55.799

00:54:11.247 --> 00:54:13.216
PARTICULAR FACILITY. SO IT IS

00:54:13.283 --> 00:54:14.484
VERY DISTURBING TO THINK THAT

00:54:14.551 --> 00:54:15.885

FOR CARE AND QUALITY CARE I

00:55:07.937 --> 00:55:09.005
KNOW THAT MY MOM DIED OF

00:55:09.072 --> 00:55:12.776
DEMENTIA WE HAD- IN A FACILITY

00:55:12.842 --> 00:55:13.376
FOR THE LAST THIRTY DAYS OR SO

00:55:13.443 --> 00:55:14.978
OVER LIFE. SHE LIVES I SAID

00:55:15.045 --> 00:55:17.213
PRIOR TO THAT IT SUBSTANTIAL

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:17.847
EVERY MONTH THE PAYMENT BUT SHE

GOT GOOD CARE BUT SOME OF THE

00:55:19.749 --> 00:55:20.884
INDIVIDUALS MOST OF THE

00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:22.519
INDIVIDUALS IN THESE FACILITIES

00:55:22.585 --> 00:55:24.320
THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES

00:55:24.387 --> 00:55:24.854
THERE ARE REGULATED BY THE

00:55:24.921 --> 00:55:26.556
STATE. ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON

00:55:26.623 --> 00:55:29.759
MEDICAID OR MEDICARE AND

00:55:29.826 --> 00:55:30.860
REIMBURSEMENT RATE IS VERY VERY

00:55:30.927 --> 00:55:32.028
LOW SOMEONE INCREASE EVERY

00:55:32.095 --> 00:55:33.430
PASSED THIS BUILDING THAT

00:55:33.496 --> 00:55:34.464
INCREASE THE COST OF DOING

00:55:34.531 --> 00:55:39.502
BUSINESS THE NOT AFFECTS DIRECT

00:55:39.569 --> 00:55:40.136
PATIENT CARE THIS IS ISN'T IT.

00:55:40.203 --> 00:55:41.838
COST MANDATE WOULD BE HIS FIRST.

00:55:41.905 --> 00:55:43.540
FOR CHEN BACK. AGAIN IS THE-

00:55:43.606 --> 00:55:44.441
RATE FOR THE MEDIC READ. WHICH

00:55:44.507 --> 00:55:45.942
IS EXTREMELY LOW SO WE NEED TO

00:55:46.009 --> 00:55:47.343
LOOK AT THAT. BUT I DO HOLY

00:55:47.410 --> 00:55:49.779
SUPPORT THE BILL TO ALLOW AND A

00:55:49.846 --> 00:55:50.980
GENERATOR TO BE PLACED IN THOSE

00:55:51.047 --> 00:55:52.482
FACILITIES. SO WHEN WE ARE

00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:54.350
ABSENT WITHOUT POWER THAT THESE

00:55:54.417 --> 00:55:56.286
PEOPLE COULD BE TAKING CARE OF

00:55:56.352 --> 00:55:57.153
AS THEY ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE

00:55:57.220 --> 00:56:00.523

PREVIOUS SPEAKERS RELATING TO

00:56:08.932 --> 00:56:10.767
THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

THE FOLKS IN THESE FACILITIES

00:56:12.001 --> 00:56:13.103
ARE CARED FOR IN AN

00:56:13.169 --> 00:56:15.138
APPROPRIATELY MY CONCERN WITH

00:56:15.205 --> 00:56:16.005
THIS BILL IS THAT IT DOESN'T

00:56:16.072 --> 00:56:18.641
APPEAR TO PROVIDE THE SAME

00:56:18.708 --> 00:56:21.211

00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:26.816
WONDER IF YOU COULD COMMENT. ON

00:56:26.883 --> 00:56:28.952
THE INHERENT DANGER THAT IS

00:56:29.018 --> 00:56:31.554
ASSOCIATED WITH STORING THAT

00:56:31.621 --> 00:56:35.391
MUCH FUEL ON SITE FOR NINETY

00:56:35.458 --> 00:56:36.426
SIX HOURS OF POWER SHOULD THEY

00:56:36.493 --> 00:56:37.761
NEED TO DO THAT THAT'S I MEAN

00:56:37.827 --> 00:56:40.430
THAT'S A LOT OF FUEL SO. IF YOU

00:56:40.497 --> 00:56:41.464

00:56:41.531 --> 00:56:42.899
CLOTHES OR NOW WHATEVER IS

00:56:42.966 --> 00:56:44.400
FINE- MISTER PRESIDENT BUT

OPPOSED TO JUST A NATURAL GAS

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:53.529

MEASURE AND WHAT IT DOES IS.

01:27:20.969 --> 01:27:23.938

JUST GIVES US ACCESS TO

01:28:40.181 --> 01:28:42.183
INFORMATION. THE F. T. B.'S

01:28:42.250 --> 01:28:43.584
ESTIMATE IS THAT IT WOULD

01:28:43.651 --> 01:28:45.019
AFFECT ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED

01:28:45.086 --> 01:28:46.587
CORPORATIONS THAT DO BUSINESS

01:28:46.654 --> 01:28:48.523

CALIFORNIA WITH FIVE BILLION OR

01:28:54.362 --> 01:28:56.130

OPPOSITION CALLS THIS BILL

01:28:57.832 --> 01:28:59.200
SHAMING BILL THAT IS NOT MY

01:28:59.267 --> 01:29:01.602
PURPOSE. I CARRIED A BILL

01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:03.538
SIMILAR TO THIS BACK IN THE

01:29:03.604 --> 01:29:05.840
ORIGINAL RECESSION WHEN WE WERE

01:29:05.907 --> 01:29:08.242
DEBATING WHETHER WE SHOULD

01:29:08.309 --> 01:29:09.310
ELIMINATE CERTAIN TAX

01:29:09.377 --> 01:29:11.279
EXPENDITURES WHETHER WE SHOULD

01:29:11.345 --> 01:29:13.781
PUT IN NEW ONES. AND I AND MANY

01:29:13.848 --> 01:29:16.217
OTHER PEOPLE FELT THAT WE JUST

01:29:16.284 --> 01:29:16.951
DIDN'T HAVE ADEQUATE

01:29:17.018 --> 01:29:19.620

01:29:19.687 --> 01:29:21.923
TAX CREDITS WE PASSED THEM FOR

01:29:21.989 --> 01:29:24.325
GOOD PURPOSES. BUT MORE INFO

01:29:24.392 --> 01:29:26.127
WOULD HELP US EVALUATE THEM NOW

01:29:26.194 --> 01:29:27.662
THIS DOES NOT GO AS I MENTIONED

01:29:27.729 --> 01:29:29.063
AS FAR AS I WOULD LIKE BUT HE

01:29:29.130 --> 01:29:30.765
BEGINS TO GIVE US SOME BASIC

01:29:30.832 --> 01:29:32.934
INFORMATION. AND IT ALSO WOULD

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.770
ALIGN US WITH SOME FIFTEEN

01:29:35.837 --> 01:29:37.772
OTHER STATES SUCH AS FLORIDA

01:29:37.839 --> 01:29:39.874

NEBRASKA AND OKLAHOMA ALL OF

01:29:42.410 --> 01:29:44.579
WHICH REQUIRE CORPORATIONS

WITHIN. THAT STATE TO DISCLOSE

01:29:48.516 --> 01:29:51.319
SIMILAR INFORMATION. SO BY WITH

01:29:51.385 --> 01:29:53.020
THAT THE FINAL THING IS THIS

01:29:53.087 --> 01:29:54.288
INFORMATION WOULD GO ON THE F.

01:29:54.355 --> 01:29:56.491
T. B.'S WEBSITE AND AS I

01:29:56.557 --> 01:29:57.925
MENTIONED IT DOES NOT ELIMINATE

01:29:57.992 --> 01:29:59.460
TAX CREDITS AND IT DOES NOT

01:29:59.527 --> 01:30:02.230
RAISE TAXES AND WITH THAT. I

EXCLUDED FROM THOSE KINDS OF

IMAGINE THAT THAT THE COMMITTEE

01:32:47.561 --> 01:32:48.996
OR EVEN THE LEGISLATURE

01:32:49.063 --> 01:32:50.231
WHATEVER ASKED THE STATE

01:32:50.298 --> 01:32:53.401
AUDITOR TO AUDIT. ALL SET FIVE

01:32:53.467 --> 01:32:55.536
HUNDRED COMPANIES I THINK WHAT

01:32:55.603 --> 01:32:59.140
THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS AND-

01:32:59.206 --> 01:33:00.775
DI DID NOT MENTION THAT IT DOES

01:33:00.841 --> 01:33:02.576
NOT REVEAL ANY PROPRIETARY

01:33:02.643 --> 01:33:06.113
INFORMATION. IS JUST TO GIVE US

01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:06.714
THREE DATA POINTS THE NAME OF

01:33:06.781 --> 01:33:08.649
THE COMPANY. THE MAITRE

01:33:08.716 --> 01:33:10.818
MOUNTAINS STATE TAX PAID IN

01:33:10.885 --> 01:33:12.853
TOTAL IN TOTAL THE NAME OUT OF

01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:15.656
STATE TAX CREDITS PAID WE

01:33:15.723 --> 01:33:16.791
ALREADY HAVE THAT INFORMATION

01:33:16.857 --> 01:33:18.693
ABOUT THOSE SAME COMPANIES IN

01:33:18.759 --> 01:33:20.194
TERMS OF WHAT. FEDERAL TAXES

01:33:20.261 --> 01:33:22.697
THEY PAY AND WHAT FEDERAL STATE

01:33:22.763 --> 01:33:24.966
OF FEDERAL CREDIT STATE TAKE

01:33:25.032 --> 01:33:27.935
BUT WE DO NOT HAVE IT. FOR THE

01:33:28.002 --> 01:33:28.936
STATE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL

01:33:29.003 --> 01:33:32.673
WOULD DO. NORMALLY WHEN I HEAR

01:33:32.740 --> 01:33:34.642
ABOUT TRANSPARENCY AND MAKING

01:33:34.709 --> 01:33:37.545
CERTAIN THAT IF CORPORATIONS-

01:33:37.611 --> 01:33:39.280
RECEIVED PUBLIC BENEFITS OR

01:33:39.347 --> 01:33:41.716
PUBLIC INVESTMENTS. I THINK

01:33:41.782 --> 01:33:44.885
IT'S REASONABLE. TO ASK THAT

01:33:44.952 --> 01:33:46.821
THAT BE DISCLOSED MY CONCERN IS

01:33:46.887 --> 01:33:49.256
THAT POSTING IT ON THE WEBSITE

01:33:49.323 --> 01:33:52.259
IN NOT SIMPLY BRING IT BACK TO-

01:33:52.326 --> 01:33:54.528
THE POLICY MAKERS FOR FOLKS

01:33:54.595 --> 01:33:57.131
WITHIN- THE GOVERNMENT FIELD.

01:33:57.198 --> 01:33:59.567
MIGHT VIOLATE EXPECTATIONS OF

01:33:59.633 --> 01:34:01.602
PRIVACY. AND THAT'S WHY I'M

01:34:01.669 --> 01:34:02.670
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF THERE'S

01:34:02.737 --> 01:34:03.804
A BALANCE HERE ON WHETHER OR

01:34:03.871 --> 01:34:05.906
NOT IT NEEDS TO BE MADE PUBLIC

01:34:05.973 --> 01:34:07.441
AS OPPOSED TO IT BEING

01:34:07.508 --> 01:34:08.876
INFORMATION THAT OTHERS CAN

01:34:08.943 --> 01:34:13.180
ACCESS. DID YOU AS YOU WENT

01:34:13.247 --> 01:34:15.549
THROUGH THIS PROCESS TO THAT

01:34:15.616 --> 01:34:16.550
WITH THAT EVER CONSIDERED AS AN

01:34:16.617 --> 01:34:20.054
OPTION- WAS CERTAINLY. THERE'S

01:34:20.121 --> 01:34:21.555
ALWAYS THE CONSIDERATION OF

01:34:21.622 --> 01:34:24.025
WHAT LEVEL OF STAFF TIME IS

01:34:24.091 --> 01:34:25.993
REQUIRED AND GIVEN THAT WE ARE

01:34:26.060 --> 01:34:29.163
IN DEFICIT. MODE IN MAY BE

01:34:29.230 --> 01:34:31.799
ASKING OUR STATE EMPLOYEES TO

01:34:31.866 --> 01:34:33.667
FOR LOW AND SUCH. WE WERE

01:34:33.734 --> 01:34:36.871
TRYING TO DESIGN A BILL THAT

01:34:36.937 --> 01:34:39.607
WOULD PUT THE LEAST PHONE-

01:34:39.673 --> 01:34:41.742
AMOUNT OF STAFF. TIME

01:34:41.809 --> 01:34:44.779
REQUIREMENT AND SO BY THE EASE

01:34:44.845 --> 01:34:47.081
OF PUTTING IT UP ONCE ONE

01:34:47.148 --> 01:34:49.583
ANNUALLY. THEN WE ALL HAVE THE

01:34:49.650 --> 01:34:51.085
ACCESS THE INFORMATION ANYTIME

01:34:51.152 --> 01:34:53.154
WE WANTED VERSUS HAVING TO

01:34:53.220 --> 01:34:55.089
REQUESTED FROM STAFF AND HAVING

01:34:55.156 --> 01:34:57.024
STAFF HAVE TO PRODUCE THAT

01:34:57.091 --> 01:34:59.293
INFORMATION EACH TIME IT EACH

01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:01.762
INDIVIDUAL REQUEST. THIS IS

01:35:01.829 --> 01:35:05.833
MORE EFFICIENT. A SINNER

01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:09.170

MISTER PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES TO

01:46:48.235 --> 01:46:50.403
SERVE BILL MAY SOUND FAMILIAR

01:46:50.470 --> 01:46:52.639
IN THAT IT WAS SIMILAR TO ONE

01:46:52.706 --> 01:46:54.307
THAT I BROUGHT LAST YEAR. IT

01:46:54.374 --> 01:46:56.009
ALSO ADDRESSES THE QUESTION OF

01:46:56.076 --> 01:46:57.811
TAX EXPENDITURES WHICH MY GOOD

01:46:57.878 --> 01:47:00.280
COLLEAGUE- FROM BERKELEY HAS

01:47:00.347 --> 01:47:02.616
SO- JUST- PRESENTED ON THE

01:47:02.682 --> 01:47:06.386
FLOOR. IF I GIVE YOU A DOLLAR

01:47:06.453 --> 01:47:09.089
ON THE PROMISE THAT YOU WILL

01:47:09.156 --> 01:47:10.924
GIVE ME BACK FIVE. THAT SOUNDS

01:47:10.991 --> 01:47:13.794
LIKE A PRETTY GOOD DEAL. BUT IF

01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:16.029
I GIVE YOU A DOLLAR ON THE

01:47:16.096 --> 01:47:17.297
PROMISE YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE ME

01:47:17.364 --> 01:47:19.432
BACK FIVE BUT YOU ONLY GIVE ME

01:47:19.499 --> 01:47:21.501
BACK TWENTY FIVE CENTS THAT'S

01:47:21.568 --> 01:47:23.737
NOT A GOOD DEAL. AND SO FOR

01:47:23.804 --> 01:47:24.871
YEARS IN THE STATE OF

01:47:24.938 --> 01:47:27.841
CALIFORNIA WE HAVE HAD THE SO

01:47:27.908 --> 01:47:30.076
CALLED TAX EXPENDITURES. WHICH

01:47:30.143 --> 01:47:32.379
WOULD HAVE BEEN TAX CREDITS TAX

01:47:32.445 --> 01:47:34.781
BREAKS TAX INCENTIVES. WHICH

01:47:34.848 --> 01:47:37.250
HAVE BEEN DESIGNED FOR VARIOUS

01:47:37.317 --> 01:47:39.319
DIFFERENT PURPOSES. SOME OF

01:47:39.386 --> 01:47:41.188
THEM TO ENCOURAGE BUSINESSES

01:47:41.254 --> 01:47:43.123
SOME OF THEM TO ENCOURAGE

01:47:43.190 --> 01:47:44.491
BETTER TREATMENT IN THE WORK

01:47:44.558 --> 01:47:45.959
FORCE FOR A VARIETY OF

01:47:46.026 --> 01:47:48.094
DIFFERENT REASONS. THE PROBLEM

01:47:48.161 --> 01:47:50.297
IS THAT MANY OF THESE TAX

01:47:50.363 --> 01:47:53.567
EXPENDITURES ARE FIFTY SIXTY

01:47:53.633 --> 01:47:55.702
YEARS OLD. AND THEY'VE NEVER

01:47:55.769 --> 01:47:58.538
BEEN ANALYZED SO THIS IS A

01:47:58.605 --> 01:48:00.140
MEASURE THAT WILL BRING

01:48:00.207 --> 01:48:02.676
TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY

01:48:02.742 --> 01:48:05.111
TO SOME OF OUR STAGE MOST

01:48:05.178 --> 01:48:07.080
COSTLY TAX INCENTIVES BY

01:48:07.147 --> 01:48:09.316
CREATING THAT PROCESS FOR THEIR

01:48:09.382 --> 01:48:12.986
ANALYSIS AND PUBLIC REVIEW.

01:48:13.053 --> 01:48:14.521
THIS MEASURE ALLOWS THE%

01:48:14.588 --> 01:48:16.289
LEGISLATURE THROUGH RIGOROUS

01:48:16.356 --> 01:48:18.959
ANALYSIS THE INVOLVEMENT OF

01:48:19.025 --> 01:48:20.427
STAKEHOLDERS AND THE

01:48:20.493 --> 01:48:22.028
RECOMMENDATION OF AN

01:48:22.095 --> 01:48:24.497
INDEPENDENT FIVE MEMBER BOARD

01:48:24.564 --> 01:48:26.566
TO DETERMINE IF HESE TAX

01:48:26.633 --> 01:48:29.035
EXPENDITURES. ARE COST

01:48:29.102 --> 01:48:31.938
EFFECTIVE IMPROPERLY DESIGNED

01:48:32.005 --> 01:48:33.473
WHETHER THEY ARE EFFECTIVELY

01:48:33.540 --> 01:48:35.308
MEETING THEIR INTENDED PUBLIC

01:48:35.375 --> 01:48:38.111
POLICY OBJECTIVES AND ARE

01:48:38.178 --> 01:48:40.580
WORTHY OF BEING CONTINUED. THIS

01:48:40.647 --> 01:48:43.116
IS BY SECTOR BY INDUSTRY WE'RE

01:48:43.183 --> 01:48:44.985
NOT CALLING OUT ANY PARTICULAR

01:48:45.051 --> 01:48:47.387
COMPANY WHAT WE'RE DOING IS

01:48:47.454 --> 01:48:48.421
WE'RE TRYING TO DETERMINE

01:48:48.488 --> 01:48:49.723
WHETHER SOME OF THESE TAX

01:48:49.789 --> 01:48:51.892
INCENTIVES REALLY MAKES SENSE

01:48:51.958 --> 01:48:54.027
TODAY. AND IF THEY DO MAKE

01:48:54.094 --> 01:48:56.196
SENSE FOR EXAMPLE THE

ONE OF OUR FORMER COLLEAGUES

01:49:01.668 --> 01:49:03.770
SHE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION THAT

01:49:03.837 --> 01:49:06.439
REQUIRES TRUST SUCH A PROCESS

01:49:06.506 --> 01:49:08.308
THAT I'VE IDENTIFIED HERE. FOR

01:49:08.375 --> 01:49:10.510
ALL NEW TAX INCENTIVES THAT

01:49:10.577 --> 01:49:12.646
WERE CREATED FROM TWENTY

01:49:12.712 --> 01:49:14.481
FIFTEEN ON ONE OF THEM WAS THE

01:49:14.547 --> 01:49:15.815
ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY TAX

01:49:15.882 --> 01:49:18.585
CREDIT. REQUIRED THE INDUSTRY

01:49:18.652 --> 01:49:20.253
TO COME FORWARD OVER A SHORT

01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:22.055
PERIOD OF TIME AND DEMONSTRATE

01:49:22.122 --> 01:49:23.657
THAT THE INCENTIVES WE HAD

01:49:23.723 --> 01:49:25.492
GIVEN THEM WERE IN FACT

01:49:25.558 --> 01:49:27.260
RETURNING FIVE DOLLARS OR FOUR

01:49:27.327 --> 01:49:31.298
DOLLARS PER DOLLAR WE GAVE THEM

01:49:31.364 --> 01:49:32.132
IN TAX CREDITS WHAT WE

01:49:32.198 --> 01:49:34.167
DISCOVERED WHAT IN FACT. IT WAS

01:49:34.234 --> 01:49:35.502
WORKING SO WELL THAT WE

01:49:35.568 --> 01:49:37.938
ACTUALLY INCREASED THE

01:49:38.004 --> 01:49:39.506
INCENTIVE. WE DON'T HAVE ANY

01:49:39.572 --> 01:49:41.741
IDEA THOUGH ABOUT THESE TAX

01:49:41.808 --> 01:49:43.944
INCENTIVES THAT WERE CREATED

01:49:44.010 --> 01:49:47.647
BEFORE. TWENTY FOURTEEN. SO

01:49:47.714 --> 01:49:48.882
THAT'S WHAT THIS MEASURE WILL

01:49:48.949 --> 01:49:53.753
DO IT WILL. TAKE A LOOK AT SOME

01:49:53.820 --> 01:49:54.955
EIGHTY TAX BREAKS OR ACTUALLY

01:49:55.021 --> 01:49:56.389
IT'S ONLY GOING TO TAKE A LOOK

01:49:56.456 --> 01:49:58.458
AT ABOUT NINE OF THEM BUT WE

01:49:58.525 --> 01:50:00.827
HAVE EIGHTY OF THEM THAT EVERY

01:50:00.894 --> 01:50:04.631
YEAR COSTS THIS STATE UP TO

01:50:04.698 --> 01:50:06.800
SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS. NOW IF

01:50:06.866 --> 01:50:09.002

01:50:09.069 --> 01:50:10.971
THEY AREN'T WORKING. YOU TAKE

01:50:11.037 --> 01:50:12.739
40% OF THAT THAT'S TWENTY FOUR

01:50:12.806 --> 01:50:14.374
BILLION DOLLARS THERE WOULD GO

01:50:14.441 --> 01:50:16.743
TO EDUCATION. LET'S SAY MOST OF

01:50:16.810 --> 01:50:18.044
THEM ARE WORKING IN OUR

01:50:18.111 --> 01:50:19.846
PROVIDING US WITH THE

01:50:19.913 --> 01:50:21.815
EXPECTATIONS WE HAD WHEN WE

01:50:21.881 --> 01:50:24.050
INTRODUCE THEM. AT LEAST WE

01:50:24.117 --> 01:50:26.219
WILL KNOW THAT WE ARE RECEIVING

01:50:26.286 --> 01:50:29.122
THAT BENEFIT BUT IF WE ARE NOT.

01:50:29.189 --> 01:50:30.857
THIS MEASURE CALLS FOR AN

01:50:30.924 --> 01:50:32.859
INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS BY THE

01:50:32.926 --> 01:50:35.028
UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. IT THEN

01:50:35.095 --> 01:50:36.930
CALLS FOR AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW

01:50:36.997 --> 01:50:39.632
BOARD. WHICH WILL ANALYZE THE

01:50:39.699 --> 01:50:41.835
INFORMATION AND PRESENTED TO

01:50:41.901 --> 01:50:43.870
THE LEGISLATURE. SO THAT THE

01:50:43.937 --> 01:50:48.641
LEGISLATURE HAS THE INFORMATION

01:50:48.708 --> 01:50:50.777
POLICIES OF THE STATE WANT TO

01:50:50.844 --> 01:50:53.146
CONTINUE WITH THOSE CREDITS.

01:50:53.213 --> 01:50:54.681
THIS IS JUST GOOD GOVERNANCE

01:50:54.748 --> 01:50:56.783
AND IN FACT THE LA- SEVERAL

01:50:56.850 --> 01:50:58.318
YEARS AGO TWENTY FIFTEEN SHOULD

01:50:58.385 --> 01:51:00.120
WE DON'T DO THOSE FOLKS AND WE

01:51:00.186 --> 01:51:03.089
REALLY SHORT. IN FACT THERE ARE

01:51:03.156 --> 01:51:04.224
MANY OTHER STATES THAT HAVE

01:51:04.290 --> 01:51:06.092
DONE THIS STATES LIKE TEXAS

01:51:06.159 --> 01:51:08.561
LOUISIANA NORTH DAKOTA

01:51:08.628 --> 01:51:10.597
MISSISSIPPI AND INDIANA. FOR

01:51:10.663 --> 01:51:13.033
EXAMPLE DO THESE EXACT KINDS OF

01:51:13.099 --> 01:51:15.435
ANALYSES AND DETERMINE WHETHER

01:51:15.502 --> 01:51:17.537
OR NOT THEY'RE GETTING THE BANG

01:51:17.604 --> 01:51:19.539
FOR THEIR BUCK THAT THEY EXPECT

01:51:19.606 --> 01:51:21.474
AND BELIEVE THAT THE PEOPLE OF

01:51:21.541 --> 01:51:23.276
THEIR STATE SHOULD HAVE THAT'S

01:51:23.343 --> 01:51:24.944
WHAT THIS MEASURE DOES. AND

01:51:25.011 --> 01:51:27.580
WITH THAT ARE AGAIN LOOKING AT

01:51:27.647 --> 01:51:29.449
OUR BUDGET DEFICIT THAT WE HAVE

01:51:29.516 --> 01:51:31.317
IF THERE IS MONEY THAT CAN AND

01:51:31.384 --> 01:51:32.719
SHOULD COME BACK TO THE STATE

01:51:32.786 --> 01:51:34.854
WE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT IT IF WE

01:51:34.921 --> 01:51:36.823
SHOULD BE INVESTING EVEN MORE

01:51:36.890 --> 01:51:39.926
WE KNOW ABOUT IT THE FACT IS WE

01:51:39.993 --> 01:51:42.028
DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS AND

01:51:42.095 --> 01:51:42.529
THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS

01:51:42.595 --> 01:51:43.563
DESIGNED TO DO. WITH IT BUT I

CALIFORNIA. THAT'S NOT JUST

01:56:31.250 --> 01:56:34.120

UNDER EXISTING HOUSING ELEMENT

01:56:48.101 --> 01:56:50.069

01:56:50.136 --> 01:56:53.306
DESIGNATE A ZONE AND THERE CITY

01:56:53.373 --> 01:56:55.842
WERE HOMELESS SHELTERS CAN BE

01:56:55.908 --> 01:56:58.211
PERMITTED AS OF RIGHT. THIS IS

01:56:58.277 --> 01:56:59.379
ADOPTED YEARS AGO IN THE

01:56:59.445 --> 01:57:01.314
LEGISLATURE AND ENSURE THAT

01:57:01.381 --> 01:57:03.082
THERE IS A PART OF A CITY WHERE

01:57:03.149 --> 01:57:04.751
YOU CAN CITE A HOMELESS SHELTER

01:57:04.817 --> 01:57:05.985

HAVING TO HAVE ALL SORTS OF

FIGHTS AND LITIGATION. HOWEVER

01:57:12.492 --> 01:57:14.861
SOME CITIES ARE DESIGNATING A

01:57:14.927 --> 01:57:17.363
ZONE. IN AN AREA AREAS WERE

01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:19.232

MIDDLE OF NO WHERE. WERE YOU

01:57:29.275 --> 01:57:30.476

IS PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE TO

01:57:34.414 --> 01:57:35.948
ACTUALLY SO YOU ONE BECAUSE IT

01:57:36.015 --> 01:57:37.383
IS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. BUILT

01:57:37.450 --> 01:57:39.986
OUT. SB ELEVEN THIRTY EIGHT

01:57:40.052 --> 01:57:42.488
WILL REQUIRE- DIED IN HIS OWN

01:57:42.555 --> 01:57:43.656
THAT'S DESIGNATED CITIES WILL

01:57:43.723 --> 01:57:45.591
STILL HAVE ENORMOUS FLEXIBILITY

01:57:45.658 --> 01:57:47.527
WHERE IT'S A DESIGNATED. BUT IT

01:57:47.593 --> 01:57:49.495
WILL REQUIRE THAT IT NOT BE IN

01:57:49.562 --> 01:57:51.597
A REMOTE INDUSTRIAL AREA THAT'D

01:57:51.664 --> 01:57:55.234
BE- GEOGRAPHICALLY CONNECTED TO

EITHER TRANSIT OR SERVICES.

01:57:57.570 --> 01:57:58.504
SOMEWHERE WHERE PEOPLEWOULD

01:57:58.571 --> 01:58:00.440
ACTUALLY BUILD A SHELTER IN

01:58:00.506 --> 01:58:03.209
ADDITION A CANNOT BE IN AN AREA

01:58:03.276 --> 01:58:03.676
WHERE IT'S PHYSICALLY

01:58:03.743 --> 01:58:05.645
IMPOSSIBLE. TO ACTUALLY SITES

01:58:05.711 --> 01:58:08.047
SHELTER IN ADDITION A STILL IN

01:58:08.114 --> 01:58:09.682
THIRTY IT CLOSES A LOOPHOLE

01:58:09.749 --> 01:58:11.451
THAT SOME CITIES ARE USING. TO

01:58:11.517 --> 01:58:13.686
BE ABLE TO HAVE A DRAFT HOUSING

01:58:13.753 --> 01:58:15.421
ELEMENT THAT NEVER ACTUALLY

01:58:15.488 --> 01:58:18.357
GETS APPROVED. CREATING BETTER

01:58:18.424 --> 01:58:20.927
INCENTIVES FOR CITIES TO

01:58:20.993 --> 01:58:21.527
ACTUALLY COMPLETE THE HOUSING

01:58:21.594 --> 01:58:25.898
IMPROPER. AND TO APPROVE IT OUR

01:58:25.965 --> 01:58:28.601
RISK. OUT AND I'VE- THANK YOU

01:58:28.668 --> 01:58:29.135
ANY ADDITIONAL DEBATE OR

01:58:29.202 --> 01:58:31.871
DISCUSS CENTER MY- THANK YOU

01:58:31.938 --> 01:58:34.674
I'M LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THE

01:58:34.740 --> 01:58:36.742
REASON THAT WE HAVE SUCH AN

01:58:36.809 --> 01:58:39.579
ENORMOUS HOMELESS POPULATION IN

01:58:39.645 --> 01:58:42.315
THIS STATE IS BECAUSE OF THE

01:58:42.381 --> 01:58:42.915
POLICIES THAT COME OUT OF THIS

01:58:42.982 --> 01:58:44.750
BUILDING. IT'S NOT BECAUSE

01:58:44.817 --> 01:58:46.819
SOMETHING THE LOCALS DID IT IS

01:58:46.886 --> 01:58:47.887
BECAUSE OF THE LAWS AND THE

01:58:47.954 --> 01:58:49.489
POLICIES THAT ARE PUT OUT BY

01:58:49.555 --> 01:58:50.790
THE PEOPLE IN THIS BUILDING

01:58:50.857 --> 01:58:52.525
SPECIFICALLY THE MAJORITY PARTY

01:58:52.592 --> 01:58:53.926
HAS BEEN RUNNING THIS STATE

01:58:53.993 --> 01:58:56.162
INTO THE GROUND FOR THE LAST

01:58:56.229 --> 01:58:58.431
MANY YEARS SO I DON'T THINK

01:58:58.498 --> 01:58:59.932
IT'S FAIR OR JUST. TO PUSH THE

01:58:59.999 --> 01:59:01.968
PROBLEM DOWN ON TO THE TO SAY

01:59:02.034 --> 01:59:04.337
PLEASE FIX THE PROBLEM THAT WE

01:59:04.403 --> 01:59:06.606
HAVE CREATED THAT DOESN'T SEEM

01:59:06.672 --> 01:59:08.908
EQUITABLE TO ME. SO I THINK IT

01:59:08.975 --> 01:59:11.043
RATHER THAN SOLUTION IS TO NOT

01:59:11.110 --> 01:59:12.478
BREATHE DOWN THE NEXT OF THE

01:59:12.545 --> 01:59:14.247
LOCALS AND TELL THEM WHERE

01:59:14.313 --> 01:59:15.515
HOMELESS SHELTERS SHOULD BE BUT

01:59:15.581 --> 01:59:17.016
ALLOW THEM TO MAKE THAT

01:59:17.083 --> 01:59:18.651
DECISION FOR THEMSELVES UNLESS

01:59:18.718 --> 01:59:19.785
OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO PUT

01:59:19.852 --> 01:59:21.354
POLICIES OUT. FROM THIS

01:59:21.420 --> 01:59:23.689
BUILDING. THAT DO SOMETHING TO

01:59:23.756 --> 01:59:25.525
ADDRESS THE HOMELESS POPULATION

01:59:25.591 --> 01:59:26.993
AND HOMELESS PROBLEM RATHER

01:59:27.059 --> 01:59:28.227
THAN EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM

01:59:28.294 --> 01:59:30.296
BECAUSE- TIME AFTER TIME YEAR

01:59:30.363 --> 01:59:32.899
AFTER YEAR WE PASS BILLS. THAT

01:59:32.965 --> 01:59:34.367
MAKE THE COST OF LIVING MORE

01:59:34.433 --> 01:59:36.502
EXPENSIVE IN CALIFORNIA. WE'VE

01:59:36.569 --> 01:59:38.504
INCREASED THE COST OF LITERALLY

01:59:38.571 --> 01:59:40.339
EVERYTHING IN THE STATE TO THE

01:59:40.406 --> 01:59:42.775
POINT. WHERE WE'VE HAD FIVE

01:59:42.842 --> 01:59:44.443
MILLION CALIFORNIANS LEAVE THE

01:59:44.510 --> 01:59:46.212
STATE LAST DECADE BECAUSE THEY

01:59:46.279 --> 01:59:47.980
CAN'T AFFORD IT. AND THOSE WHO

01:59:48.047 --> 01:59:50.149
CAN'T MOVE HAD MOVED TO THE

01:59:50.216 --> 01:59:53.753
STREETS. THAT'S THE FAULT OF

01:59:53.819 --> 01:59:55.288
THE POLICIES COMING OUT OF THIS

01:59:55.354 --> 01:59:57.423
BUILDING NOT THE FAULT OF THE

01:59:57.490 --> 01:59:59.225
LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS I WOULD

01:59:59.292 --> 02:00:02.662

ACCEPTABLE LOCATION BUT IT'S

02:00:48.541 --> 02:00:50.276
INEVITABLY TURNING INTO A DOG

02:00:50.343 --> 02:00:52.778
FIGHT MY CONCERN IS THAT

02:00:52.845 --> 02:00:56.882
FORCING THIS. THAT THE HOUSING

STATUTORILY DECREASED IF THEY

02:01:04.156 --> 02:01:09.061
DON'T IS OF CONCERN TO ME. AS

02:01:09.128 --> 02:01:10.396
THIS IS GOING THROUGH THE

02:01:10.463 --> 02:01:12.198
VARIOUS COMMITTEE PROCESS USED

02:01:12.264 --> 02:01:13.699

AROUND THAT YES IT'S

02:04:19.752 --> 02:04:22.054
CONTROVERSIAL THAT'S WHY THIS

02:04:43.509 --> 02:04:44.910
THINGS THAT CHANGE THAT THERE'S

02:04:44.977 --> 02:04:46.579
THE FIFTH CYCLE THE SIX PACK OF

02:04:46.645 --> 02:04:48.280

HAVE HEARD FROM BY CITIES HAVE

02:04:49.982 --> 02:04:52.518
CHALLENGING IT IS. TO BE ABLE

TO COMPLY BECAUSE YOU DON'T

02:04:53.919 --> 02:04:55.855
EVEN KNOW WHAT'S COMING AROUND

02:04:55.921 --> 02:04:57.590
THE CORNER. NEXT YEAR. AND SO

02:04:57.656 --> 02:04:58.824
I'M HOPING THAT- HE COULD SPEAK

02:04:58.891 --> 02:05:01.393
TO THAT- ISSUE OF THE RESOURCES

02:05:01.460 --> 02:05:03.495
THAT ARE AVAILABLE. TO COMPLY

02:05:03.562 --> 02:05:04.997
BECAUSE- THAT THAT'S A

02:05:05.064 --> 02:05:06.532
CHALLENGE FOR THE FULLY. FOR

02:05:06.599 --> 02:05:08.801
SMALLER COMMUNITIES. THE SECOND

02:05:08.868 --> 02:05:11.003
QUESTION WOULD BE THAT. I DON'T

02:05:11.070 --> 02:05:12.938
SEE THE LEAGUE OF CITIES HAS

02:05:13.005 --> 02:05:14.506
WAITED ON THIS LEGISLATION AND

02:05:14.573 --> 02:05:15.608
I WAS HOPING YOU COULD SHARE

02:05:15.674 --> 02:05:17.776
WITH US THE DISCUSSIONS THAT

02:05:17.843 --> 02:05:19.111
HAVE HAD WITH THEM SO THAT WE

02:05:19.178 --> 02:05:20.913
CAN BE ELIMINATED BY THAT

02:05:20.980 --> 02:05:22.748
CONVERSATION WHERE IT HAS

02:05:22.815 --> 02:05:27.319
LANDED. LIGHTLY. SO I. OF THE

02:05:27.386 --> 02:05:30.155
PRESENT. ON SECRET. I DON'T

02:05:30.222 --> 02:05:31.523
WANT TO SPEAK FOR THE LEAGUE OF

02:05:31.590 --> 02:05:32.625
CITIES LEAGUE OF CITIES HAS

02:05:32.691 --> 02:05:34.760

02:05:34.827 --> 02:05:38.030
THIS BILL- I'VE NOT SEEN IT- AT

02:05:38.097 --> 02:05:40.933
LEAST- BECAUSE THIS BILL IS NOT

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:44.837
ANY KIND OF. DICEY IT IS IT IS

02:05:44.904 --> 02:05:47.039
A BELT AND SUSPENDERS. APPROACH

02:05:47.106 --> 02:05:48.841
TO SAYING WE HAVE THIS HOUSING

02:05:48.908 --> 02:05:50.643
ELEMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR FIFTY

02:05:50.709 --> 02:05:52.978
YEARS. ALWAYS SAY TO CITIES IS

02:05:53.045 --> 02:05:53.946
YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH A

02:05:54.013 --> 02:05:55.447
PLANNING PROCESS AND PLAN FOR

02:05:55.514 --> 02:05:58.350
GROWTH. AND PLAN TO MAKE SURE

02:05:58.417 --> 02:06:00.019
THAT PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO SLEEP

02:06:00.085 --> 02:06:01.453

ENOUGH HOUSING. FOR PEOPLE. HI

AND OVER TIME UNFORTUNATELY

02:06:06.025 --> 02:06:07.092
WE'VE SEEN THAT THERE CITIES

02:06:07.159 --> 02:06:08.694
THAT AVOID THAT REQUIREMENT IN

02:06:08.761 --> 02:06:11.163
DIFFERENT WAYS- AND SOMETIMES

02:06:11.230 --> 02:06:12.698

REQUIREMENT EDITION MEANS

02:06:20.239 --> 02:06:22.741
SOMETHING- SO THAT THAT'S

02:06:22.808 --> 02:06:25.344
REALLY. THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS

02:06:25.411 --> 02:06:26.111
IS ABOUT NOW IN TERMS OF

02:06:26.178 --> 02:06:28.280
