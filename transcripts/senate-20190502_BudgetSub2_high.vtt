AND AT THE TIME THE COST FOR THE

00:08:06.419 --> 00:08:08.054
KITCHEN WAS ABOUT FIVE MILLION

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:08.921
DOLLARS.

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:10.690

WHEN THE DEPARTMENT MIGHT SEE

00:08:30.076 --> 00:08:32.311
EYES SIGNIFICANT COST INCREASE --

00:08:32.378 --> 00:08:33.479
ESPECIALLY SOMETHING DRIVEN BY A

00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:35.882
SCOPE CHANGE THAT'S UNEXPECTED

00:08:35.948 --> 00:08:36.949
AND THEY WOULD TYPICALLY HAVE

00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:39.385
THE TIME TO KIND OF GO BACK AND

00:08:39.452 --> 00:08:40.386

IMAGINE RIGHT BECAUSE THIS IS.

00:10:18.517 --> 00:10:19.852
WAY ABOVE I BELIEVE AT THE

00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:20.686
ESTIMATE ON THAT WHERE YOU

00:10:20.753 --> 00:10:23.322
THOUGHT SO.

00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:25.091
IT'S A PRETTY EXTREME CASE.

00:10:25.157 --> 00:10:27.793
I DON'T SEE THIS ALL THE TIME.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.595

00:10:46.412 --> 00:10:47.013
I THINK THE OTHER CONCERN THAT I

00:10:47.079 --> 00:10:50.182
HAVE IS VERY SIMILAR CAMP.

00:10:50.249 --> 00:10:50.816

I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE FOR

00:11:03.929 --> 00:11:05.064
FLIPPING KITCHEN THAT WE'RE

BUILDING ON TO A VERY OLD

00:11:27.219 --> 00:11:28.187
FACILITY AS WELL.

00:11:28.254 --> 00:11:32.658
AND THE THE NEED FOR FIRE WATER --

00:11:32.725 --> 00:11:34.527
IS EVIDENT IN THAT KITCHEN BEING

00:11:34.593 --> 00:11:36.128

FACILITY AS WELL AND MORE OF THE

00:11:38.697 --> 00:11:41.033
FACILITY COULD HAVE GONE WITH IT --

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.201
SO -- THIS.

00:11:42.268 --> 00:11:43.869
WELL WE KNOW WE NEED FIRE WATER

LOOK INTO ALL OF OUR OPTIONS --

00:11:49.008 --> 00:11:50.042
IT WE JUST HAVEN'T HAD THE TIME

00:11:50.109 --> 00:11:52.878
TO DO THAT AND IN MOVING FORWARD --

00:11:52.945 --> 00:11:53.679
THIS WILL GIVE US THE

00:11:53.746 --> 00:11:56.549
OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT AND MOVE

00:11:56.615 --> 00:11:58.350

OTHER CAMP AND FIRE WATER AND I

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:05.291
MEAN I THINK THAT TO MY GOODNESS

00:12:05.357 --> 00:12:06.759
YOU'RE DOING THIS IS A GIANT

00:12:06.826 --> 00:12:09.929
RESERVOIR -- I WOULD SEEM GET IT

00:12:09.995 --> 00:12:10.596
IN REGARDS IS A SPECIAL

00:12:10.663 --> 00:12:11.430
CONDITIONS.

THAT THE DIRECTOR JUST MENTION

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:14.834
BUT I THINK THIS IS A BIT OVER

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.102
KILL.

00:12:16.168 --> 00:12:17.103
I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S OVER KILL

00:12:17.169 --> 00:12:19.672
AS FAR AS A REQUIREMENT -- EVEN

00:12:19.738 --> 00:12:20.606
IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE.

00:12:20.673 --> 00:12:22.808
MEANS OF GETTING THAT SORT OF

00:12:22.875 --> 00:12:25.544
WATER STORAGE AND DELIVERY -- WE

00:12:25.611 --> 00:12:26.979
DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME TO GO

00:12:27.046 --> 00:12:29.381
THROUGH WITH THE G. S. ON THAT

00:12:29.448 --> 00:12:31.050
WE HAVE BEEN IN CAMP ENGINE.

00:12:31.117 --> 00:12:32.785
AND THAT THE NEAREST FIRE

00:12:32.852 --> 00:12:34.987
STATIONS WITHIN TWO MILES ONE OF

00:12:35.054 --> 00:12:37.056
OURS PAINS CREEK -- THAT SHOULD

00:12:37.123 --> 00:12:38.891
REDUCE THE VOLUME -- IN A

00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.726
PREVIOUS FIRE -- THEY DRAFTED

00:12:40.793 --> 00:12:41.894
OUT OF THE CREEK THAT RUNS

00:12:41.961 --> 00:12:43.829
THROUGH CAMP THAT'S A WATER

00:12:43.896 --> 00:12:45.231
SOURCE AS WELL -- WE'RE STILL

GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE DECADE

00:12:47.333 --> 00:12:49.235
FIREWATER BUT WHAT WE'RE HOPING

00:12:49.301 --> 00:12:51.337
TO DO IS LOOK AT ALL THE

00:12:51.403 --> 00:12:53.973
ALTERNATIVE MEANS TO TO ADDRESS

00:12:54.039 --> 00:12:55.141
WHAT THAT THE CODE IS.

00:12:55.207 --> 00:12:56.609
IN IN WHEN I SAY OVER KILL IS

00:12:56.675 --> 00:12:59.879

PRIOR VERY SIMILAR PROJECT --

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.041
SOME OF THOSE THINGS WERE SORT

00:16:49.108 --> 00:16:50.909
OF JUST EXPORTED OVER TO BE USED

00:17:29.148 --> 00:17:30.983
THAT IF THEY ARE USING THE

00:17:31.049 --> 00:17:32.117
ESTIMATES ARE DESIGNS FROM OF A

00:17:32.184 --> 00:17:34.086
PRIOR PROJECT THAT THEY ARE

00:17:34.153 --> 00:17:34.753

TO THE COST INCREASE ON THIS

00:17:40.759 --> 00:17:42.227

00:17:44.196 --> 00:17:45.164
IF THIS PROCESS THESE AREN'T IN

PLANS.

00:21:46.271 --> 00:21:49.307
AND THE REVIEW OF THOSE PLANS --

00:21:49.374 --> 00:21:51.309
THAT CALIFORNIA IS GOING.

00:21:51.376 --> 00:21:53.378
TO HAVE TO DO UNDER THE STATE

FIRE MARSHAL'S OFFICE.

00:21:55.781 --> 00:21:57.182
WE'RE CLEAR BECAUSE I THINK

00:21:57.249 --> 00:21:58.116
MAYBE.

00:21:58.183 --> 00:22:00.118
LEGISLATORS NAIVELY ASSUME THAT

00:22:00.185 --> 00:22:02.220
WHEN YOU YOU ALLOCATE TWO

00:22:02.287 --> 00:22:03.622
HUNDRED MILLION AND WE DID IT IN

00:22:03.689 --> 00:22:06.291
THIS SUBCOMMITTEE BEFORE NINE A

00:22:06.358 --> 00:22:07.559
ONE THAT THAT SORT OF INCLUDED

00:22:07.626 --> 00:22:09.094
THE WHOLE NOT.

00:22:09.161 --> 00:22:11.129
ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW IN THE

00:22:14.066 --> 00:22:14.866
JUDGE DETERMINED.

00:22:14.933 --> 00:22:17.969
UC DETERMINED THAT WE NEEDED TO

00:22:18.036 --> 00:22:20.806
EXPAND TWO HUNDRED MILLION.

00:22:20.872 --> 00:22:22.140
UNDER NINE A ONE IS AT THE NOT

00:22:22.207 --> 00:22:23.675

00:22:23.742 --> 00:22:24.776
FINANCE HOUSING HERE DEPARTMENT

00:22:24.843 --> 00:22:26.044
OF FINANCE IT JUST TO CLARIFY

00:22:26.111 --> 00:22:27.379
I'M THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION

ACTIVITIES AND PROJECTS -- OF

00:22:34.252 --> 00:22:35.320
THAT AMOUNT THERE'S A HUNDRED

00:22:35.387 --> 00:22:38.290
AND SIXTY MILLION FOR PROJECTS

00:22:38.356 --> 00:22:40.992

I AM. HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION

00:22:42.227 --> 00:22:43.562

00:22:43.628 --> 00:22:44.096
FIVE MILLION FOR PRESCRIBE

00:22:44.162 --> 00:22:44.930
FACTOR SO THAT THAT ALLOCATION

00:22:44.996 --> 00:22:46.465
IS REALLY SPECIFIC FOR WHAT IT'S

00:22:46.531 --> 00:22:47.432
INTENDED.

00:22:47.499 --> 00:22:48.266
TO THEN THERE'S THE BROADER

00:22:48.333 --> 00:22:49.835

THAT.

00:22:58.343 --> 00:22:59.745
NEED TO BE IMPLEMENTED AND SO

00:22:59.811 --> 00:23:01.847
THAT DOESN'T COME OUT OF THAT

00:23:01.913 --> 00:23:02.647
TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT

00:23:02.714 --> 00:23:04.316

00:23:08.587 --> 00:23:09.254
WAS PROVIDED.

00:23:09.321 --> 00:23:10.222
THIS IS INTERESTING BECAUSE THE

00:23:10.288 --> 00:23:11.590
YEAR BEFORE WE DID TWO HUNDRED

00:23:11.656 --> 00:23:13.458

FIVE FIVE YEARS ALEJO YOU AGREE

00:23:19.731 --> 00:23:21.633
TO ANNOUNCES YEAH A THINK WITH

THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I HAS

00:23:22.434 --> 00:23:24.603
SAID IS ACCURATE SO WE DIDN'T WE

00:23:24.669 --> 00:23:25.704
DON'T HAVE ANY ISSUES WHEN WE

00:23:25.771 --> 00:23:27.038
LOOKED AT THAT PROPOSAL FOR THE

TWO POSITIONS. TO GIVE YOU A

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:30.142
LITTLE BIT MORE CONTEXT ON THE

00:23:30.208 --> 00:23:32.844
JANUARY BUDGET INCLUDED ONE

00:23:32.911 --> 00:23:35.013
POSITION AT CAL FIRE OF FOR

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.815
DOING AT THE REVIEW OF THE WILD

00:23:36.882 --> 00:23:38.083
FIRE MITIGATION.

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:39.584
PLANS FROM THE UTILITIES AND

00:23:39.651 --> 00:23:40.218
REALLY THAT'S WHAT THESE

00:23:40.285 --> 00:23:41.586
POSITIONS ARE GOING TO BE DOING

00:23:41.653 --> 00:23:42.621
AND SUPPORTING THAT.

00:23:42.687 --> 00:23:44.389
ON THIS WOULD ADD TWO MORE

00:23:44.456 --> 00:23:46.158
POSITIONS CURRENTLY I'M AND

00:23:46.224 --> 00:23:47.926
RECENTLY THE DEPARTMENT HAS HAD

00:23:47.993 --> 00:23:50.362
IT WINE TEMPORARY POSITION.

00:23:50.428 --> 00:23:53.031
I'M WORKING ON THE PRE AS BEING

00:23:53.098 --> 00:23:54.099
I KNOW WHEN WELFARE MITIGATION

00:23:54.166 --> 00:23:57.302
PLANS AND THAT WAS FUNDEDTHROUGH A COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT

00:23:57.369 --> 00:23:58.603
WITH THE P. C..

00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:00.472
AND AND CAL FIRE WASN'T

00:24:00.539 --> 00:24:01.439
SPECIFICALLY CALLED OUT

00:24:01.506 --> 00:24:02.874
NECESSARILY AS HAVING A ROLE IN

00:24:02.941 --> 00:24:03.842
THAT THEY WERE JUST MORE

00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:05.710
PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

00:24:05.777 --> 00:24:07.345
UNDER SB NINE A ONE BECAUSE HOW

00:24:07.412 --> 00:24:09.414
FIRE ON IS SPECIFICALLY CALLED

00:24:09.481 --> 00:24:11.383
OUT AS HAVING A ROLE IN I'M IN

00:24:11.449 --> 00:24:12.818
REVIEWING THE PLANS.

00:24:12.884 --> 00:24:13.852
AND WE THINK OF THEM HAVING

00:24:13.919 --> 00:24:16.121
THEIR OWN STAFF SEEMS REASONABLE

00:24:16.188 --> 00:24:18.256
AND THREE POSITIONS GIVEN THE

00:24:18.323 --> 00:24:19.658
NUMBER IN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE

00:24:19.724 --> 00:24:22.060
PLANS I'M SEEMED REASONABLE --

00:24:22.127 --> 00:24:23.395
ARDOR STANDING OF THAT

00:24:23.461 --> 00:24:24.529
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE RULED

00:24:24.596 --> 00:24:26.031
LEAN AND JUST REALLY AFFECTS THE

00:24:26.097 --> 00:24:27.699
NUMBER AS WELL FOR MITIGATION

00:24:27.766 --> 00:24:30.869
PLANS SO GOING FROM I THINK SIX

00:24:30.936 --> 00:24:31.937
TO ELEVEN ON AND SO THAT'S PART

00:24:32.003 --> 00:24:33.171
OF WHAT IS CHANGING THIS FROM

00:24:33.238 --> 00:24:34.472
WHAT YOU SIGNED JANUARY IS THAT

00:24:34.539 --> 00:24:35.807
THERE'S NO MORE PLANS THAT

00:24:35.874 --> 00:24:36.174
THEY'RE GONNA.

00:24:36.241 --> 00:24:43.281
HAVE TO BE.

00:24:43.348 --> 00:24:44.549
REVIEWING AND AND TO US THAT

00:24:44.616 --> 00:24:45.217
WOULD BE SEPARATE AND APART FROM

00:24:45.283 --> 00:24:45.884
THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION WHICH IS

00:24:45.951 --> 00:24:46.818
GOING TO BE GRANT FUNDS GOING

00:24:46.885 --> 00:24:47.319
OUT FOR FOREST HEALTH.

00:24:47.385 --> 00:24:48.253
AND FIRE PREVENTION AND THIS IS

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.487
REALLY ON THE UTILITY SIDE SO

00:24:49.554 --> 00:24:50.755
WOULD I BE TOO NAIVE TO I

00:24:50.822 --> 00:24:52.457
ANTICIPATE THAT THERE'S COULD BE

00:24:52.524 --> 00:24:54.025
A LOT OF WEALTH UTILITY WILDFIRE

00:24:54.092 --> 00:24:55.660
MEDICATION PLANS FILES SO WE'LL

00:24:55.727 --> 00:24:57.529
TO HAVE THREE PEOPLE REVIEWING

00:24:57.596 --> 00:24:57.729
THEM.

00:24:57.796 --> 00:24:58.930
THAT THEY WOULD BE.

00:24:58.997 --> 00:25:00.699
LOOK DAD REVIEWED AND APPROVED

00:25:00.765 --> 00:25:04.069
AT A FASTER PACE OR IS HE JUST

00:25:04.135 --> 00:25:05.937
MORE APPLIQUE -- APPLICATIONS

00:25:06.004 --> 00:25:08.340

00:25:08.406 --> 00:25:09.908
PLAN SO WILL BE AT THE SAME

00:25:09.975 --> 00:25:10.208
[inaudible]

00:25:10.275 --> 00:25:12.544
TEMPO.

00:25:12.611 --> 00:25:16.615
RELATED TO THAT AND I I DO HAVE --

00:25:16.681 --> 00:25:18.583

00:25:23.889 --> 00:25:26.491
TIME LINE THAT IS REQUIRED FOR

00:25:26.558 --> 00:25:29.261
THE MIDDLE REVIEW AND APPROVAL --

00:25:29.327 --> 00:25:31.363
SO WE WOULD FIT INTO THAT

00:25:31.429 --> 00:25:34.900
TIMELINE OF CPUC.

00:25:34.966 --> 00:25:38.169

OUR UTILITY WILDLIFE MEDICATION

00:28:00.412 --> 00:28:02.547

00:30:33.665 --> 00:30:35.700
THE SECOND KEY ASPECT IS THAT

SERVICE.

00:30:57.488 --> 00:30:59.023
INSTEAD OF THINKING IN WORD

BRING ANALYTICS TO BEAR.

00:31:20.645 --> 00:31:22.580

INNOVATED SYSTEM TO TRACK ALL

00:31:24.649 --> 00:31:26.417

WE SUBMITTED A REPORT TO THE

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:27.839
SERVICE BASED BUDGETING.

00:33:27.905 --> 00:33:30.007
WHY ARE WE IN THE SPOT I THINK

00:33:30.074 --> 00:33:32.477
WE ARE IN THE SPOT BECAUSE?

00:33:32.543 --> 00:33:34.379
OF THE PURSUIT OF SUSTAINABLE

00:33:34.445 --> 00:33:35.680
FUNDING FOR FISH AND WILDLIFE

00:33:35.747 --> 00:33:37.115
CONSERVATION.

00:33:37.181 --> 00:33:38.549
WE HAVE MORE ANIMALS AND PLANTS

00:33:38.616 --> 00:33:40.418
IN THE STATE THAN ANY OTHER

00:33:40.485 --> 00:33:41.719
STATE IN THE UNION.

00:33:41.786 --> 00:33:43.755
MORE OF THEM ARE FOUND NO WHERE

00:33:43.821 --> 00:33:45.857
ELSE IN THE WORLD.

00:33:45.923 --> 00:33:47.892
SO THEY'RE INCREDIBLY RARE.

00:33:47.959 --> 00:33:49.460
WE HAVE AN INTERSECT OF A

00:33:49.527 --> 00:33:50.928
THRIVING ECONOMY.

00:33:50.995 --> 00:33:53.364
AND INCREDIBLE NATURAL WEALTH.

00:33:53.431 --> 00:33:55.800
IN MAKING THOSE WORK TOGETHER IS

00:33:55.867 --> 00:33:56.300
A LOT OF OUR DEPARTMENTS

00:33:56.367 --> 00:33:58.703
JURISDICTION.

00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:01.672
SO WHY SERVICE BASED BUDGETING.

00:34:01.739 --> 00:34:03.674
I THINK TO ME FOR OUR DEPARTMENT

00:34:03.741 --> 00:34:04.909
SERVICE BASED BUDGETING IS OUR

00:34:04.976 --> 00:34:08.112

EFFICIENCIES AROUND

00:34:15.319 --> 00:34:17.388
ACCOUNTABILITY.

00:34:17.455 --> 00:34:19.490
YOU GAVE US SPECIFIC ASSIGNMENTS

YOU TOLD US BY DECEMBER

00:34:23.561 --> 00:34:26.564

00:34:39.777 --> 00:34:41.546
STATE PARKS DEPARTMENT?

00:34:41.612 --> 00:34:43.781
WHICH HAS FACILITATED THAT PARKS

00:34:43.848 --> 00:34:45.483
DEPARTMENT'S RELATIONSHIP.

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:47.151
AND I THINK YOU SEE IT FEET INTO

00:34:47.218 --> 00:34:47.985
PROP.

00:34:48.052 --> 00:34:49.720

FOUR MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR.

01:29:54.922 --> 01:29:56.524
THE AG'S OFFICE CHARGES IS BASED

01:29:56.591 --> 01:29:57.792
ON THE HOURS THEY DEVOTE TO OUR

01:29:57.859 --> 01:29:59.894
CASES SO IT WE DON'T USE ALL THE

01:29:59.961 --> 01:30:01.295
FUNDS EVERY YEAR IT DEPENDS ON

01:30:01.362 --> 01:30:03.464
HOW COMPLEX OUR CASES ARE

01:30:03.531 --> 01:30:05.066
WHETHER THEY GO.

01:30:05.133 --> 01:30:05.767
TO EXPERT WITNESSES YOU NEED

01:30:05.833 --> 01:30:08.336
TRAVEL THINGS LIKE THAT.

01:30:08.402 --> 01:30:09.604
WE'RE ASKING UP OR IF FORTY A

01:30:09.670 --> 01:30:11.372
MILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE WE HAVE

01:30:11.439 --> 01:30:13.107
BUMPED UP AGAINST THAT'LL THAT

01:30:13.174 --> 01:30:14.408
THREE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLAR

01:30:14.475 --> 01:30:15.643
LIMIT IN PAST YEARS.

01:30:15.710 --> 01:30:17.078
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE COMPLEX

01:30:17.145 --> 01:30:19.680
CASES OR MULTIPLE COMPLEX CASES

01:30:19.747 --> 01:30:21.182
AND WE ANTICIPATE INCREASED

01:30:21.249 --> 01:30:22.984
COSTS IN THE COMING YEARS FOR

01:30:23.050 --> 01:30:24.385
TWO MAJOR REASONS.

01:30:24.452 --> 01:30:27.255
FIRST I'M FOR THE VOLKSWAGEN AND

01:30:27.321 --> 01:30:29.056
FIAT CHRYSLER CASES WE WERE

01:30:29.123 --> 01:30:30.825
FORTUNATE THAT THE AG'S OFFICE

01:30:30.892 --> 01:30:32.226
REPRESENTED US THROUGH THE

01:30:32.293 --> 01:30:34.495
CONSUMER LAW SECTION BECAUSE

01:30:34.562 --> 01:30:36.030
THERE WERE CONSUMER CLAIMS.

01:30:36.097 --> 01:30:37.231
AND WHAT THAT MEANT IS THEY

01:30:37.298 --> 01:30:39.467
DIDN'T CHARGE US THEIR COSTS.

01:30:39.534 --> 01:30:41.035
SO FOR THOSE TWO CASES WE

01:30:41.102 --> 01:30:42.703
ACTUALLY -- WE'RE IN PRETTY GOOD

01:30:42.770 --> 01:30:43.538
SHAPE FROM A FINANCIAL

01:30:43.604 --> 01:30:45.973
STANDPOINT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE.

01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:48.442
I'M THEY ARE NOT I'M CHIMING IN

01:30:48.509 --> 01:30:49.977
FROM THE CONSUMER LAW SECTION OR

01:30:50.044 --> 01:30:52.246
IN OUR REMAINING CASES WE ARE

01:30:52.313 --> 01:30:53.948
CONTINUING TO INVESTIGATE.

01:30:54.015 --> 01:30:56.184
ADDITIONAL EMISSION VIOLATIONS

01:30:56.250 --> 01:30:57.652
AND BECAUSE THE NATURAL

01:30:57.718 --> 01:30:59.153
RESOURCES SECTION IS

01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:05.459
REPRESENTING US IN THOSE CASES --

01:31:05.526 --> 01:31:06.060
THEY WE ARE BEING CHARGED FOR

01:31:06.127 --> 01:31:06.561
THEIR WORK NOW.

01:31:06.627 --> 01:31:07.562
THE SECOND MAJOR REASON AS THIS

01:31:07.628 --> 01:31:08.462
COMMITTEE KNOWS WE'RE ENGAGED IN

01:31:08.529 --> 01:31:08.963
A FIGHT WITH THE FEDERAL

01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:10.131
GOVERNMENT.

01:31:10.198 --> 01:31:11.098
OVER THE RIGHT OF CALIFORNIA TO

01:31:11.165 --> 01:31:13.868
SET OUR OWN EMISSIONS STANDARDS.

01:31:13.935 --> 01:31:14.669
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS TRYING

01:31:14.735 --> 01:31:15.536
TO ROLL BACK OUR VEHICLE

01:31:15.603 --> 01:31:17.271
STANDARDS MAKING IT HARDER IF

01:31:17.338 --> 01:31:18.840
NOT IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO MEET

01:31:18.906 --> 01:31:20.575
OUR AIR QUALITY AND CLIMATE

01:31:20.641 --> 01:31:21.475
GOALS.

01:31:21.542 --> 01:31:23.277
WE'VE ALREADY FILED A FREEDOM OF

TECHNICAL BASIS BEHIND TO THEIR

01:31:28.916 --> 01:31:30.184
PROPOSALS.

01:31:30.251 --> 01:31:31.619
AND IF AS WE EXPECT EPA

01:31:31.686 --> 01:31:33.454
FINALIZES A RULE TO WITHDRAW OUR

01:31:33.521 --> 01:31:35.156
WAIVER AND TAKE AWAY OUR

01:31:35.223 --> 01:31:36.524
AUTHORITY TO SET VEHICLE

01:31:36.591 --> 01:31:37.325
STANDARDS.

01:31:37.391 --> 01:31:38.492
YOU CAN THAT WE'RE GONNA BE

01:31:38.559 --> 01:31:39.694
SELLING OVER THAT ONE THAT WE'RE

01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:41.662
GONNA BE FIGHTING TO ENSURE THAT

01:31:41.729 --> 01:31:43.231
WE CAN PROVIDE HELPFUL AIR TO

01:31:43.297 --> 01:31:44.198
CALIFORNIANS.

01:31:44.265 --> 01:31:44.999
NOW THEY MENTIONED AT THE

01:31:45.066 --> 01:31:46.234
BEGINNING OF OUR OF MY REMARKS

LITIGATION COSTS ARE LOW.

01:31:49.103 --> 01:31:50.271
WE WILL NOT BE EXPENDING THESE

01:31:50.338 --> 01:31:53.407
FUNDS BUT IF WE NEED TO LITIGATE

01:31:53.474 --> 01:31:54.242
TO PROTECT OUR AIR QUALITY

01:31:54.308 --> 01:31:56.878
STANDARDS WE ABSOLUTELY WANT TO

01:31:56.944 --> 01:31:58.045
BE ABLE TO DO THAT.

01:31:58.112 --> 01:32:01.349
