TERM CARE IT IS NOW IN SESSION WE'RE GONNA START AS A SUB COMMITTEE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A FULL QUORUM -- FIRST STEP IS A AB FOR EIGHTY ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALIS [inaudible] WELCOME. VETERANS HER NUMBERS AFTER WE IT ONLY STARTED AS OF TWO AND A HALF MONTHS AGO BUT THANK YOU FOR THAT RECOGNITION UBER ADULTS SINCE. TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HOWEVER THIS POSITION NO LONGER EXISTS AFTER STATE BUDGET CUTS AND TWENTY ELEVEN ELIMINATED FUNDING FOR THE GERIATRIC MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST ONE AND FIVE OLDER ADULTS. EXPERIENCES MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS HOWEVER LESS THAN ONE THIRD OF OLDER ADULTS THE UNITED STATES -- I ACTUALLY HAVE MENTAL HEALTH CARE'S THAT ARE ACTUALLY MEANT. THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED BY THE UCLA CENTER FOR HEALTH POLICY RESEARCH WAS SUPPORT WHAT FROM THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. FOUND A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES AND DEFICIENCIES IN THE CURRENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH STRUCTURE FOR OLDER ADULTS. THAT THIS BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS BY ESTABLISHING STATEWIDE LEADER -- WITH ME I DO HAVE TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT AND WOULD APPRECIATE AN AYE VOTE WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE. THANK YOU ARE THEIR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT [inaudible] THANK. YOU KNOW WHAT BEFORE WE START SINCE WE HAVE A QUORUM IN PLACE WHY DON'T WE DOOR QUICK ROLL CALL. AND AND THEN WE CAN CONTINUE. TO TAKE YOUR TIME AND GET READY -- A SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL THIS AREA [inaudible] PRESENT [inaudible] VOEPEL [inaudible] WARNER HORVAT [inaudible] KALRA [inaudible] LACKEY [inaudible] REYES [inaudible] RUBIO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE START. OKAY MIKE SON. OKAY YES I SURELY CROWN WITH A CALIFORNIA SENIOR LEGISLATURE AND HE ORIGINAL AUTHOR OF THIS PARTICULAR BILL. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE 22% THE SENATE BILL TO ALL OF YOU -- I THINK THAT THE THE ONE ISSUE THAT I WANT TO GET ACROSS RIGHT NOW IS IF THERE ISN'T ANY OVERSIGHT ON HELL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. ARE PROVIDED TO OLDER ADULTS. THIS IS WHY ASSEMBLY BILL FOUR EIGHTY IS AN ESSENTIAL BILL MOVING FORWARD. THERE WAS AN ADMINISTRATIVE POSITION THAT YOU MAY BE AWARE OF IN PLACE FROM TWO THOUSAND SEVEN UNTIL. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN TO BRIDGE THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH AND THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING. MUCH WAS ACCOMPLISHED AND THE AGING SERVICES NETWORK WAS MOBILIZED IN COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE. OFFERING EVIDENCE BASED. DEPRESSION MANAGEMENT AS WELL AS EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAMS. IT IS SAID THAT DUE TO BUDGET SHORTFALLS IMPACTING MANY PROGRAMS. THE GOVERNOR RE DIRECTED THIS FUNDING TO COUNTIES FOR MENTAL HEALTH PREVENTION SERVICES AND THIS IS WHERE WE RAN INTO SOME ISSUES. OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY FOR BID TO HOST THE HEALTH SERVICES FUNDS AND PROGRAMS IS AN IMPERATIVE FOR BOTH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AND THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. THE STATE LEVEL POSITION WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE MENTAL HEALTH PLANS SUBMITTED ARE REVIEWED TO ENSURE THAT THE FUNDING REQUESTED WAS ACTUALLY USED TO FUND THE PLAN SUBMITTED. THIS IS VITALLY IMPORTANT. IF A PLAN IMPLEMENTED CREATES AN INNOVATIVE PROGRAM SOLVED IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING TO BE SHARED WITH OTHER COUNTY ORGANIZATIONS FOR THEIR CONSIDERATION. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT HALF THE COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA REPORT THAT THEY HAVE AN ADMINISTRATIVE UNIT FOR THE SERVICES. THAT TO DO THAT. THOSE THAT DO HAVE A ROBUST PROGRAM. OTHERS HOWEVER TEND TO BELIEVE THAT OLDER ADULTS ARE. ADULTS WHO WERE JUST OLD. AND THEY DO NOT RECOGNIZE THE COMPLEX MEDICAL ISSUES THAT ALSO NEED TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN MENTAL HEALTH PLANNING PROGRAMS AND SERVICE DELIVERY. MANY CAN'T COUNTIES DO NOT PURPOSELY REACH OUT TO OLDER ADULTS TO OFFER NECESSARY SPECIAL MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS. I CAN ALSO TELL YOU THAT FROM MY OWN PERSONAL RESEARCH THERE ARE ORGANIZATIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WILL SUBMIT A PLAN. FOR THEIRMENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THEIR PARTICULAR COUNTY. AND THEY END UP USING THAT MONEY FOR SOMETHING ELSE THERE'S NO ACCOUNTABILITY FOR HOW THAT MONEY IS BEING SPENT WHICH IS THIS WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO. IN THE PAST THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH HAD PULLED TEAMS WORKING ON CHILDREN'S ISSUES NO SPECIALIST FOR OLDER ADULTS. WELL CHILDREN'S ISSUES CONTINUE TO BE IMPORTANT. OLDER ADULTS NEED TO BE TREATED EQUALLY WE ALL KNOW THE AGING POPULATION IS RAPIDLY EXPANDING AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW THAT. I CAN'T HELP YOU. THANK YOU SHIRLEY. AND GOOD AFTERNOON -- CHAIR NAZARIAN VICE CHAIR VOCAL AND DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS KATHERINE KATE SPENT ON A RESEARCH SCIENTIST AT THE UCLA CENTER FOR HEALTH POLICY RESEARCH I AM PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY TO PRESENT. SOME OF THE FINDINGS FROM A STUDY WE COMPLETED IN LATE TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT ARE QUITE RELEVANT TO THE BILL THAT IS UNDER CONSIDERATION HERE TODAY AB. FOR EIGHTY IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WE WERE CONTRACTED BY THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION TO EVALUATE HOW OLDER ADULTS WERE BEING SERVED BY THE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM. AND WHAT PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE SINCE PASSAGE OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT OF TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR TO MY KNOWLEDGE THAT'S THE ONLY TIME THAT OLDER ADULTS. AND THEIR EXPERIENCE UNDER THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUNDS HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED. LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WE FOUND THROUGH THE COURSE OF OUR STUDY. WE FOUND THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT UNMET SERVICE NEEDS AND A VERY ON EVEN RESPONSE TO OLDER ADULTS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. WE FOUND VERY FEW EXAMPLES OF PROGRAMS OUR OUTREACH EFFORTS THAT WERE SPECIFICALLY TAILORED TO MEET THE SPECIAL NEEDS OF OLDER ADULTS AS SURELY AS POINTED OUT. OFTEN WITH COMPLEX MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT REALLY CAN COMPLICATE THE TREATMENT OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES. WE ALSO FOUND SERIOUS DEFICITS IN THE GERIATRICS WORK FORCE INCLUDING A LACK OF GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRISTS AND FEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR CROSS TRAINING ACROSS AGING AND MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALISTS. OUTCOME MEASUREMENT AND REPORTING DATA AT THE COUNTY LEVEL WAS QUITE LIMITED WHILE SOME COUNTIES INCLUDED OUTCOME DATA FOR OLDER ADULTS MOST LACKED INFORMATION ON THE PENETRATION OR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE PROGRAMS. FINALLY WHILE WE IDENTIFIED PROMISING PROGRAMS THAT MANY COUNTIES PUT FORTH TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE DEFICITS THESE EFFORTS WERE UNEVENLY IMPLEMENTED. THERE WERE DISPARITIES FOUND BOTH WITHIN A CROSS COUNTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE ACCESS TO CARE AND QUALITY OF CARE FOR OLDER ADULTS WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND BEHAVIOR HEALTH NEEDS. SO BASED ON OUR FINDINGS WE IDENTIFIED SEVERAL ACTIONS THAT COULD BE TAKEN TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE DEFICITS AND IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR OLDER ADULTS. THESE RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE ESTABLISHING AN ADMINISTRATIVE LEADERSHIP POSITION AT THE STATE LEVEL DEDICATED TO OLDER ADULT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. WITH THE PROPER AUTHORITY THE LEADERSHIP POSITION COULD CONTRIBUTE TO AN OVERSEE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICIES THAT BETTER SERVES THE CONCERNS OF OLDER ADULTS WITH MEANT MENTAL OR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. SUCH A POSITION WOULD PROVIDE NEEDED OVERSIGHT FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR OLDER ADULTS AND COULD ALSO ESTABLISH STANDARDIZED DATA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS USING STANDARDIZED ASSESSMENTS. TOOLS THAT FOR OLDER ADULTS AND CORPS MENTAL HEALTH DATA OUTCOMES. HOW CAN MEASURES? I'M A STATE LEVEL OLDER ADULT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATOR WOULD ALSO BE POSITION TO GUIDE COUNTY LEVEL EFFORTS TO ENHANCE OLDER ADULTS OUT REACH AND DOCUMENTATION OF UNMET NEED. THEY WOULD ALSO PROMOTE STANDARDIZED GERIATRIC TRAINING A PROVIDERS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AN INCREASE SERVICE INTEGRATION EFFORTS WHICH ARE SO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY WEEK BETWEEN MEDICAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AGING AND SUBSTANCE USE SERVICES. TO PROVE TO PROMOTE COMPREHENSIVE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR OLDER ADULTS AND MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE STUDY IF YOU LIKE I HAVE A LITTLE. HANDY FACT SHEET SHARE THANK YOU THANK YOU -- ARE THERE.

EIGHTY NINE SEVENTY THANK YOU MISTER COMMITTEE MEMBERS ASSEMBLY BILL NINE SEVENTY WOULD PROVIDE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION FOR SENIORS AND THE DISABLED TO HEALTH CARE APPOINTMENTS IN RURAL AREAS. WHERE THERE ARE MANY EXISTING BARRIERS -- TO HEALTH CARE ACCESS SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL WOULD ESTABLISH A GRANT PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT AGING WHICH PROVIDE FOR THE PURCHASE OR LEASE OF ZERO MISSION OR NEAR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. TO PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION TO AND FROM NON EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE APPOINTMENTS FOR OLDER INDIVIDUALS PERSONS LIVING WITH DISABILITIES WHO RESIDE IN RURAL DESERT. OR MOUNTAIN AREAS THIS IS LET ME JUST. TELL YOU MISTER IS A PROBLEM THAT I PROBABLY HEAR ABOUT -- THE MOST AT TOWN HALLS AND JUST DIFFERENT COMMUNITY COFFEE. IN MY DISTRICT AND AND TALKING ABOUT COLLEAGUES THIS IS SOMETHING WE HEAR ABOUT I THINK UP AND DOWN THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- SENIOR JUST TRYING TO GET TO THEIR MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS AND TRY TO FIND THE TRANSPORTATION TO DO THAT. AND SO WITH HERS WITH THAT MOTION AND THAT SECOND I'D APPRECIATE LABOR THANK YOU THANK YOU. WITH THIS IS IN SUPPORT. I WAS WONDERING IF YOU REALLY NEED IN MY AREA MY WITNESSING -- FOR THE RECORD. I'VE AND WARREN FROM CALIFORNIA SENIOR LEGISLATURE IN WHERE THE SPONSOR AND THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL AND WHAT I'D LIKE TO REMIND YOU IS THAT WE DO HAVE MANY SENIORS WHO SUFFER FROM CHRONIC DISEASES. AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WHO HAVE DIFFICULTY. GETTING TO THEIR MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS AND I ASK YOU. I HEARD DAM ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY. MENTION HIS LATEST BIRTHDAY MILESTONE [inaudible] SIXTY VERY GOOD. BUT IMAGINE IF YOU WERE. SEVENTY AND COULD NOT -- YES I DO TOO I HOPE YOU GET THEIR TO BUT IF THE BEEN DISCHARGED FROM ACUTE HOSPITAL. AND TOLD TO GET THAT YOU HAVE TO COME BACK FOR TREATMENTS. AND THAT YOU LIVE QUITE A DISTANCE AWAY. IN A RURAL AREA. THAT BECOMES A CONTENDER. DOESN'T -- ALSO YOU KNOW WE ADD TO IT THE FACT THAT NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE TRANSPORTATION. FOR A MYRIAD OF REASONS. WHAT YOU GONNA DO YOU CHOOSE FOR LOOK TO FRIENDS YOU LOOK TO NEIGHBORS? BUT THEY MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE -- IN MENDOCINO COUNTY RESIDENT TOLD US THAT THEY HAVE A VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATION THAT PROVIDES THIS SERVICE. BUT THEY'RE HAVING PROBLEMS RECRUITING THE DRIVERS BECAUSE THE DRIVERS DON'T WANT TO PUT THE WEAR AND TEAR ON THEIR PERSONAL VEHICLES -- LOCAL TRANSIT. MANY AREAS HAVE NO SERVICE WHATSOEVER. DEPARTMENT ON AGING DOESN'T HAVE CONTRACT FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR TRANSPORTATION THE MONEY'S THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ALLOW IT ALLOTTED TO THEM HAS TO BE USED FOR DIRECT SERVICES. BECAUSE YOU HAVE SAID. THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE. AGING IN PLACE IS A PRIORITY. AN EXCEPTION HOWEVER. WE SEE AN SAN BERNADINE KNOWS RURAL AREA. IS A RIDER'S CENTERED. VOLUNTEER PROGRAM. IN WHICH THE WRITERS IN ROLAND PROGRAM. RECRUIT THEIR OWN VOLUNTEER DRIVERS AND RECEIVE MILEAGE REIMBURSEMENTS. FOR THE THE TRANSPORTATION. IN MANY OF CALIFORNIA SMALLER COUNTIES THAT'S OVER HALF OF OUR COUNTIES IN THE STATE. ACTUAL NUMBERS OF UNSERVED SENIORS IS UNKNOWN. BUT WITH GOVERNMENT POLICIES ENCOURAGING SAYS A SENIOR STATE AGENT PLACE AND THE LACK OF HOUSING ALTERNATIVES THEIR CLUSTERS OF VERY SMALL RESIDENTIAL ENCLAVES. OFTEN WITH POOR RESIDENTS THROUGHOUT OUR VERY RURAL AREAS. WE FEEL THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS NEED SERVICE ALSO. THE TRANSPORTATION PROBLEMS AT LAKE IN MENDOCINO COUNTIES. OCCUR STEM FROM RURAL LOW DENSITY POPULATION BASE. AND SEPARATED BY MANY MILES AND MOUNTAINS AND LAKES. MANY SENIORS THERE NAY TRANSPORTATION TO FAR OFF LOCATIONS SUCH AS SANTA ROSA AND SAN FRANCISCO FOR SPECIALIZED MEDICAL TREATMENTS. TRANSPORTATION BETWEEN THE TOWNS AND CITIES WITHIN THE COUNTIES IS DIFFICULT. AND EXPENSIVE BECAUSE OF THE DISTANCE. ONE OF OUR MEMBERS IN ASSEMBLY DISTRICT. TO SAYS IN PRACTICE THE MORE URBANIZED AREAS ARE SERVICED. STATEWIDE NON EMERGENCY TRANSPORT SERVICES FOR HIGHER. ARE PRIMARILY AVAILABLE NEAR URBAN AND SUBURBAN AREAS SUCH AS ORANGE AND SAN DIEGO COUNTIES. AND IN THE NORTHEAST SERVICES AVAILABLE TO AREAS FROM SAN JOSE TO MORAN COUNTIES. AND EAST TO ALAMEDA AND SENT SENT ACROSS TO COUNTY. MOST OF THESE PRIVATE COMPANIES UP HERE TO USE MODIFIED AMBULANCE VEHICLES. THAT HOLD A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE [inaudible] ONE EXCEPTION. ONE EXCEPTION IN THE STATE. IS MEDI VAN. OPERATED BY STANISLAUS COUNTY. A TRANSIT WHICH IS INEXPENSIVE RESERVATION ONLY SERVICE FROM MODESTO TO OAKLAND SAN FRANCISCO IN PALO ALTO. ONE USER OF THIS SERVICE RELATED TO ME THAT SHE MUST DRIVE. TO GET THE TRANSPORTATION FROM HER HOME IN TO WOLLEMI COUNTY TO MODESTO. TO CATCH THE VAN TO GET TO UC SAN FRANCISCO TO MEET WITH HER CARDIOLOGISTS. IF ONE IS NOT FEELING WELL. EVEN THAT SERVICE CAN BE DIFFICULT. GETTING OLD IS IN LEVEL. BEING OLD AND POOR IS A CHALLENGE. BEING SICK IS A GREATER CHALLENGE. BEING OLD SICK AND LIVING IN REMOTE ISOLATED AREAS CAN BE A BURDEN. BUT HAVING TRANSPORTATION FOR ACCESSING YOUR MEDICAL NEEDS LESSONS THE CHALLENGE. WE'RE PROPOSING THIS MEDICAL TRANSIT SOLUTION THROUGH THE PURCHASE AND OPERATIONS OF ENERGY RENEWABLE VEHICLES FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND. THAT ADDRESS THE RURAL SERIOUS I'M SORRY SENIOR AND DISABLED COMMUNITIES NEEDS. AND CONTINUED TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS. OF REDUCING EMISSIONS. WE HOPE THAT YOU AGREE AND VOTE FOR THIS BILL [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY OTHER SUPPORTERS. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS MARK WHAT'S I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. BOARD OF SUPERVISORS -- WE'VE RECENTLY COME TO APPRECIATE THIS BILL AND WE ONLY GOT A LETTER IN. THIS LAST WEEK TO THE AUTHORS OFFICE IN SUPPORT IN FAVOR OF THE BILL WE DID THE BOARD STOP SHORT OF TAKING A SUPPORT POSITION. BUT THEY WERE WE THEY'VE ASKED US TO WORK WITH YOUR OFFICE AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE ARE VERY STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF THE IDEA OF USING G. G. R. F.. FOR SOME OF THESE ACTIVITIES AND WE'VE GOT DONE SOME RESEARCH HAVE WE FEEL SHOWS THAT THERE'S A CORRELATION BETWEEN. GREENHOUSE GAS AND IN DOING SOME OF THESE -- NEW TRANSPORTATION FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES SO APPRECIATE. YOUR ATTENTION TODAY AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AUTHORS OFFICE THANK YOU THANK YOU. CAN AFTERNOON CHAIR I'M STILL DEBBIE TOTH I'M STILL WITH CHOICE AN AGING -- I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THIS BILL FORWARD AM I WANT TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND I WANNA BLOW IT UP I WANT TO MAKE IT. BIGGER -- FOLLOWING CONTRA COSTA COUNTY BECAUSE OUR PROGRAMS AT TREES AN AGING WHERE WE SERVE ADULT A HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS WERE LICENSED HEALTH CARE FACILITY WE BRING FOLKS IN. THEY RECEIVE HEALTH SERVICES THAT THEY WOULD RECEIVE AT A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY AND THEN THEY GO HOME AND THEY SLEEP IN THEIR OWN BEDS INSTEAD OF BEING IN INSTITUTIONS. SO GETTING TO AND FROM OUR PROGRAMS MOST FOLKS TAKE PARATRANSIT SERVICES THAT'S THAT EIGHTY A REQUIRED SERVICE. THAT THE TRANSIT PROVIDERS MUST PROVIDE THERE IS A LACK OF PERSON CENTERED DIGNIFIED. SOME SORT OF LEVEL OF WHAT IS OKAY AND THAT OKAY -- I WILL TELL YOU A STORY OF A WOMAN WHO ATTENDS OUR FARSI PROGRAM WE HAVE MULTIPLE PROGRAMS IN ONE OF OUR PROGRAMS IS A FARSI SPEAKING PROGRAM. YOU DON'T MIND KEEPING IT BRIEF. SHE WAS ON THE BUS HER HOUSE IS SEVEN POINT SIX MILES FROM OUR CENTER. IN TWO HOURS INTO HER TRIP SHE ASKED THE DRIVER TO STOP SO SHE COULD GO TO THE RESTROOM AND THE DRIVER DID NOT STOP AND CHANNING CONTENTS EPISODE ON THE BUS. IT'S NOT JUST A WORLD PROBLEM. IT'S A HUMAN DIGNITY PROBLEM AND SO I SUPPORT THIS AND I ASK THAT YOU. BLOW IT UP AN EXPANDED LARGER THANK YOU. RESEARCHER GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN JOHN PORTER CALIFORNIA SCENE LEGISLATURE I THINK THE ARGUMENTS HAVE BEEN CLEARLY ARTICULATED. AND WE STRONGLY SUPPORT. PASSAGE OF THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS KATHERINE GARCIA NUMBER SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA. OUR MEMBERS ARE OPPOSED TO SPECIFIC LANGUAGE IN ASSEMBLY BILL NINE SEVENTY THAT WOULD UNDERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND G. G. R. F.. R. MEMBERS ASK THE REMOVED NEAR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES FROM THE BILL. AB NINE SEVENTY WOULD PROVIDE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION ASSISTANCE FOR SENIORS AND THOSE LIVING WITH DISABILITIES WHICH WE AGREE IS VERY IMPORTANT. HOWEVER THE LEGISLATION CURRENTLY STATE FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING WOULD RECEIVE G. G. R. F. APPROPRIATIONS FOR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AND NEAR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. THE DUDE EUROPE IS INTENDED TO HELP CALIFORNIA TRANSITION TO A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE. THE APPROPRIATIONS SHOULD FIND PROVEN PROGRAMS THAT REDUCE EMISSIONS IN THE SHORT TERM AND HELP CALIFORNIA ACHIEVE ITS CLIMATE GOALS. WHEN IT COMES TO CLEAN TRANSPORTATION ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES PROVIDE THE MOST EFFECTIVE PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFIT BY REDUCING HARMFUL GREENHOUSE GAS AND CRITERIA MISSIONS? THERE ARE ZERO MISSION SHUTTLES THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE HEARING CALIFORNIA. SO WE URGE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS TO PLEASE AMEND AB NINE SEVENTY TO ENSURE THAT YOU DO YOUR AFTER APPROPRIATIONS PROVIDE THE MAXIMUM BENEFIT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS. OF BRINGING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. WHAT WAS THE LARGE IS A SORRY ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS WHAT WAS THE LOGIC OF INCLUDING THE NEAR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES NOT JUST ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AND YOUR BILL? WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TRYING TO EXPAND THIS TO AS MANY SENIORS AS POSSIBLE AND SOME OF THESE AREAS IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET SOME OF THESE VEHICLES ESPECIALLY WITH A FUNDING THAT'S ATTACHED TO THEM. SO WE'RE TRYING TO BE AS ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT DISADVANTAGING SENIORS GETTING TO THEIR APPOINTMENTS AT THE END OF THE DAY WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING FOLKS. TO AND FROM THEIR APPOINTMENTS AND SO THAT'S WHY WE HAD THAT LANGUAGE IN THERE. TO ALLOW -- ZERO AND YEARS ZERO BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO EXCLUDE. SENIORS ARE PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE THIS IS A A REAL HARDSHIP -- FOR THE SENIORS TO THEN BE LEFT OUT OF NOT GETTING TO THEIR APPOINTMENTS YOU KNOW THE MOTIVATION IS REALLY GETTING PEOPLE TO AND FROM THEIR APPOINTMENTS. CLEARLY BUT IT ARE YOU SAYING THAT THERE ARE YOUR YOU ADDED THE NEAR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES BECAUSE OF SOME AREAS WERE EASY'S. DON'T HAVE SUFFICIENT RANGE WELL SOMETIMES IT'S A RANGE BUT IT'S ALSO THE LACK OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR CHARGING THOSE UNITS [inaudible] YES. STRESS THANK YOU I DON'T HAVE MY OWN MIKE -- NO NO I'M KIDDING HE'S ALREADY PROVIDED THAT TO ME. OF I DO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS ONE WHEN I HAVE MY SENIOR ADVOCACY WEEKS -- EVERY YEAR. ONE OF THE TOP COMPLAINTS FROM MY SENIORS IS LACK OF TRANSPORTATION. AND I I THINK THAT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE BE AS CREATIVE AS POSSIBLE A PRE APPRECIATE THAT YOU ARE BEING CREATIVE IN THIS. I APPRECIATE -- ZERO CLUBS COMMENTS BECAUSE IN THE END THERE REALLY LOOKING TO THE BEST THING FOR OUR FUTURE. BECAUSE WHEN WHEN THE VEHICLES ARE ARE POLLUTING OUR AIR IT'S OUR SENIORS AND ARE VERY YOUNG CHILDREN THE ONES WHO SUFFER THE MOST -- AND WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE DO THE VERY BEST THAT WE CAN FOR BOTH BUT I'M VERY GLAD THAT THAT YOU BROUGHT THIS FORWARD. TRANSPORTATION FOR OUR SENIORS AND NOT JUST FOR MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS IF THEY WANT TO GO VISIT A FRIEND IF THE WHATEVER IT IS THEY WANT TO DO WE NEED TO BE ABLE. TO TO TO PROVIDE MORE FOR THEM I KNOW IT COSTS MONEY WE SPEND MONEY ON A LOT OF OTHER THINGS AND I I AGAIN I APPRECIATE THAT YOU BROUGHT THIS IN HERE. THANK YOU MISTER S.. ECHO THE COMMENTS -- THANK YOU AGAIN FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- AND THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE COMPLAINT THAT I HAVE AS WELL IN MY DISTRICT THAT SENIORS DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY. TO TO TO ACCESS -- BECAUSE OF TRANSPORTATION AND SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I UNDERSTAND -- YOU KNOW THE REASONS THAT THAT YOU -- BROUGHT THIS -- AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOU ARE THINKING UPS OUTSIDE OF THE BOX AND I KNOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN CRITICIZED FOR NOT -- FOR OTHER THINGS AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE THINKING CREATIVELY TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR SENIORS ARE TAKING CARE OF AND I KNOW THAT THE SENIOR POPULATION APPRECIATED AS WELL. THANK YOU APPRECIATE THOSE CALLS ALL RIGHT. SEEING NO OTHER COMMENTS WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE AT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE I MEAN LET'S HELP AS MANY SENIORS AS WE CAN. AND NOT LET THE JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK WHATEVER THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CELIS EVEN GIVEN A PLACE LIKE LOS ANGELES COUNTY WITH THE BENEFITS AND THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE AND A PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE THROUGH -- ACCESS -- WHICH IS A MULTI MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM COMMITTED ONLY TO PROVIDING THE SERVICE OF TRANSPORTATION NON EMERGENCY TRANSPORTATION. WE STILL SEE WHAT THE NEEDS ARE -- HOW DESPERATE THE VARIOUS COMMUNITIES ARE WHAT THE G. GEOGRAPHIC OF OF OF ROLE IS THAT PLEASE AND AND -- THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE BEEN PROVIDING SERVICES TO EVERYONE. WHO IS IN NEED SO -- THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD THIS BILL IS DOUBLE REFERRED GOING TO TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE NEXT SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE THE VERY APPROPRIATE FORM FOR SIERRA CLUB -- TO CONTINUE ITS CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR THANK YOU SO MUCH UP WITH THAT THERE'S A MOTION BY MISS BROUGH BO AND A SECOND BY MISTER LACKEY -- LET'S OPEN THE ROLE. AB. NINE SEVENTY THE NET NAZARIAN I AM VERY NICE VOEPEL. HELLO HI WARNER HARD ROCK HI. WARNER HER ROTH AYE KALRA SIGN. KALRA I LACKEY. LACKEY AYE REYES. HI. RES I RUBIO. RUBIO AYE IF THE MEASURE PASSES. THANK YOU MISTER CELIS OF THAT. ITEM NUMBER TWO AT WAS -- THE NUMBER SEVEN NINETY SEVEN BY MISTER GRAYSON THAT HAS BEEN PULLED SO WE WILL GO TO ITEM NUMBER -- FOUR AB ELEVEN TWENTY EIGHT BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND MISTER CELIS ON YOUR WAY OUT THANK YOU ALSO FOR YOUR PATIENCE SORRY I WAS RUNNING A LITTLE LATE. PRESENTING MY OWN BILL IN ANOTHER COMMITTEE. THE PLACE I WANT. UBIQUITOUS THIS IS A VIRTUE. AND THAT WE CAN. AFFORD. HELLO CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. FOR EIGHTY ONE ONE TWO EIGHT AT THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS TO EXPAND ACCESS TO PACE THE PROGRAM AT ALL INCLUSIVE CARE FOR THE ELDERLY. I THE PROGRAM AMONG COLLUSIVE CARE FOR THE ELDERLY ELDERLY PACE. IS A WELL RESPECTED EFFICIENT PROGRAM THAT AIMS TO KEEP SENIORS IN THEIR HOMES AND COMMUNITIES NOT IN INSTITUTIONS. PACERS ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS BY PROVIDING ALL INCLUSIVE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID ALL COVERED BENEFITS THROUGH ONE STOP SHOP HE'S CENTERS. THEY PROVIDE PREVENTIVE PRIMARY ACUTE AND LONG TERM CARE SERVICES. IS A PROVEN SUCCESS STORY ACROSS THE STATE BENEFICIARIES HAVE FEWER HOSPITALIZATIONS AND NURSING HOME ADMISSIONS. THE REPORT BETTER HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE AND HIGH RATES OF SATISFACTION WITH OVERALL CARE PIECES ALSO A MONEY SAVER WHEN I COMPARE TO OTHER MODELS OF CARE. AND THE PROGRAM CURRENTLY SEIZE THE STATE AN ESTIMATED TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS BUT THERE IS A CRITICAL SHORTAGE OF PACE PROVIDERS ACROSS THE STATE -- WE'RE EXPLORING A NUMBER OF STRATEGIES TO TRY TO ADDRESS THIS SHORTAGE AND INCREASED PACE CAPACITY THE SOLUTION AND THIS BILL IS REALLY. STRAIGHTFORWARD ADMINISTRATIVE ARE CURRENTLY PACE ORGANIZATIONS BASED A COMPLEX AND LENGTHY APPROVAL PROCESS TO START UP NEW PROGRAMS AND EXPAND EXISTING ONES. THIS INCLUDES AN EXTENSIVE APPROVAL PROCESS BY BOTH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THIS BIFURCATED PROCESS IS INEFFICIENT AND TO PLAY COULD HAVE AND CAN SIGNIFICANTLY DELAYED THE ROLLOUT OF NEW AND EXPANDING PACE PROGRAMS SO. THIS BILL WILL ESSENTIALLY CONSOLIDATE THE LICENSURE FUNCTIONS OF PACE WITH IN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AND STREAMLINED APPROVALS FOR NEW PAY START UPS -- AND EXPANSIONS BY ALIGNING LICENSURE TIME LINES WITH PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION. I WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES ON THE SPELL AND WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT PLEASED TO INTRODUCE TO WITNESSES HERE. TO TESTIFY WITH US TODAY. I MOVE THIS BILL. WE CAN BE FIXED. SO I'LL BE VERY SHORT AND I'LL JUST ADD THAT IN ADDITION TO DH CS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF LICENSING. ARE OR DPH WE ALSO HAVE THE SAME OVERSIGHT BY CMS SO CMS AND DH CS TO A GOOD JOB OF COORDINATING THEIR COMING OUT AND LICENSING US AND THEY ARE VERY STRICT GUIDELINES ABOUT HOW FAST THEY HAVE TO DO THAT. BUT BEFORE THEY CAN DO THAT THEY'VE GOT TO HAVE ALL THE OTHER OF ISSUES LINED UP AND SO THE DEPARTMENT OF LICENSING OR DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IS JUST SO BUSY RIGHT NOW. WITH THE NUMBER OF HOSPITALS AND CLINICS AND SO FORTH. THAT WE FEEL LIKE CONSOLIDATING THIS WHEN WE'VE DONE A SPREAD SHEET YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT IS LIKE THE FIFTH GROUP THAT CAME THROUGH AND LOOK AT THE VERY SAME THINGS. AND IT'LL BE MORE EFFICIENT WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT UNDERSTAND PACE. AND WHO ARE ALREADY OUT THERE DOING THE SAME THING. AND I WOULD JUST ADD THAT RIGHT NOW FOR MY OWN PROGRAM I AM THE I'M LINDA TROWBRIDGE I FORGOT TO SAY THAT AND I AM THE CAL PACE CHAIR WHICH IS OUR ASSOCIATION OF PAGE PROGRAMS IN THE STATE. AS WELL AS THE C. E. O. CENTER FOR ELDERS INDEPENDENCE IN IN THE EAST BAY WHICH HAS BEEN AROUND FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS STARTING OUT AS EIGHTY EIGHT SEASON THEN ONE OF THE EARLY REPLICATIONS OF PACE WHICH UNLOCKED FOUNDED FORTY FIVE YEARS AGO. SO -- OF I HAD ONE OF MY SITES DELAYED BY ALMOST THREE YEARS IN TAKING MORE THAN A YEAR TO GET THROUGH DEPARTMENT OF AGING AND THEN TODAY PH AND THEN ON OUT. AND THE SECOND ONE DELAYED BY SIX MONTHS AND THESE PROGRAMS ARE VERY -- BUILDING INTENSITY OF IT TAKES. SOMEWHERE BETWEEN EIGHT AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO BUILD PAY CENTER. NOT TO MENTION THAT ONCE LICENSING COMES OUT YOU'VE ALREADY HAD TO HAVE YOUR STAFF FIRED AND STANDING. THERE WITHOUT ANY ABILITY TO SERVE ANYBODY SO IT'S A HUGE CHALLENGE TO REPLICATE -- AND THE ONLY THE THING I'D AS IT WERE PART OF A AN INITIATIVE ORACLE LAB OR DAVE WITH ALL THE PAGE PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA OREGON AND WASHINGTON.
