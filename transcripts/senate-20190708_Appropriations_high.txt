B. -- FIFTEEN NINETY ONE MR COOLEY YOU WERE NOT HERE -- WHEN I TALKED ABOUT THIS IS THE FISCAL COMMITTEE AND OBVIOUSLY PLEASE CONFINE YOUR? COMMENTS TO THE FISCAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE BILL WE'RE NOT HERE. TO REDO THE WORK OF THE POLICY COMMITTEE SO WITH THAT. SENT TO US ON AB. FIFTEEN NINETY ONE THE I.. S. POLICY JUST TO PRESENT THIS BILL BECAUSE I THINK THERE IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT STATE INTEREST. IN MAKING SURE INSURANCE. LAWMAKERS CENTURY TWENTY HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE OF THE SUBJECT MATTER. THE UNUSUAL PART OF CALIFORNIA LAW UNIQUE IN OUR CODES. ARE MUCH OF THE INSURANCE CODE -- IS ARISE FROM THE WORK OF A BODY KNOWS ANY I SEE. THEY MAKE MODEL LAWS THAT THEY COME INTO US TO ADOPT. IT'S REALLY UNIQUE WITH OUR SYSTEM OF LAWS THE FEEL OF INSURANCE IS SUBJECT TO DELEGATION TO AN UNELECTED THIRD PARTY UNITY. TODAY I SEE. THEY RUN ACCREDITATION PROGRAM THEY HAVE EIGHTEEN STATUTES DO TO ADOPT -- AND SO THIS BILL JUST ADDRESSES. IN A WORLD IN WHICH SO MUCH OF OUR INSURANCE CODE IS BY DELEGATION TO A THIRD PARTY. THERE IS A PUBLIC INTEREST IN ENSURING THAT OUR LAW MAKERS ARE INFORMED THE SUBJECT. THE EXPENSE OF THIS BILL SUPPORTS MAKING MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE INSURANCE LAWMAKERS I CAN ATTEST THAT THE NATURE OF IN A IN COIL MEETINGS FOR EXAMPLE ARE SO INFREQUENT. AND THEIR SCHEDULING OFTEN CONFLICTS WITH OUR WORK. I'M NOT TOO CONCERNED ABOUT ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE INSURANCE CODE INTEREST PLEASE EVER MAKING THESE MEETINGS. BUT CERTAINLY AN INTERESTING CALIFORNIA THAT ARE LAWMAKERS KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS FIELD. SO -- I JUST WANT TO PRESENT THAT ISSUE IT IS UNIQUE IN OUR INSURANCE CODE THIS DELEGATION FACTOR -- IF THERE IS A REASONABLE WAY TO SELECT WHICH COMMITTEE MEMBERS WOULD GO TO AN COIL I'M ALL FOR THAT. I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK THEY'LL BE A RUSH ON IT I THINK THE PRACTICAL. ANSWERS WOULD BE LIMITED. SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT pSERVICES FROM ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OZ THEIR FILE. A YES WE DON'T HAVE AN APPROVED POSITION ON THIS BILL BUT WE KNOW THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE -- ANTICIPATES THE COST TO ADMINISTER THIS BILL COULD BE APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM THE INSURANCE FUND.

THEY'RE DOING A LOT OF WE ORGANIZATION NOW SO WE CAN BE VERY CHEAP TO KIND OF JUST DIAL THAT INTO THE STUFF THAT'S GOING ON IN THE THE BILL DOES ALLOW. FOR A LONG LEAD TIME FOR TO GET DONE PROPERLY.

WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WHEN IT'S LIKE A ONE POINT IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE? WHAT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO AN INDIVIDUAL'S? OF COST OF INSURANCE AND IT I JUST WONDER WHAT. SHOULD KNOW FROM ONLY THE CUSTOMER MARK FROM OUR EXPERIENCED ON THE COMMUNITIES AND YOU KNOW WHAT IS A FAIR QUESTION FOR MARCH PRINCE POINT CHANGE BEHAVIOR. IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE THE OTHER AMENDMENT THAT WE TOOK IS. ON LIKE EVERY OTHER OFFENSE THAT IS LIKE THIS OR SIMILAR TO IT DANGEROUS DRIVING ACTIVITY YOU DON'T EVEN GET THE POINT ON THE FIRST INFRACTION.

GET OUT OF POLICY COMMITTEE WE WILL HEAR THAT LATER TODAY SO WE ARE GOING TO RECESS. AT THIS MEETING UNTIL LATER TODAY THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE. HEARING FROM THIS MORNING WE HAVE A QUORUM -- WE ARE HEARING -- THE LAST BILL THAT WAS ON OUR DOCKET. WHICH IS ASSEMBLY BILL. TEN FIFTY FOUR BY MR HOLDEN MISSED MR MAYS AND MS BURKE. AND THERE MAY BE SOME OTHERS THAT I DON'T KNOW BUT THAT'S THE TRIUMPHANT. AND WITH THAT WILL BEGIN WITH MISTER HOLDEN PLEASE TELL US ABOUT SB. FOR A. B.. TEN FIFTY FOUR IF YOU MISTER CHAIR AND AND IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE BEFORE YOUR COMMITTEE TODAY. A WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY PERCENT EARLIER TODAY AND SENATE ENERGY AND REAL TO COVER A GOOD DEAL OF THE POLICY PIECES AROUND THIS BILL -- WE DO KNOW THAT THERE'S A EXPRESS INTEREST ON THE FISCAL IMPACT AND SO WE WILL HAVE -- REPRESENT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE CHOI SAID -- AS A PART OF OUR PRESENTATION WITH MR MAYS AND I WILL SERVE LEAD OFF AND THEN WE'LL HAVE. WELL ONE OF OUR CONSULTANTS GIVE -- SURVEY OVERVIEW OF THE SAFETY -- COMPONENTS OF THIS BILL. AS WE ALL KNOW THIS IS NOT A NEW ISSUE -- IS ONE WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR MORE THAN A YEAR AND A HALF. LAST YEAR EXTENSIVE DEBATE RESULTED IN SB NINE A ONE WHICH WAS ALSO INTENDED TO STABILIZE THE FISCAL SITUATION OF OUR UTILITIES. I WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN FROM EXTENSIVE HEARINGS REPORTS. AND DEBATES AS WELL AS THE GOVERNOR STRIKE FORCE REPORT. AND THE RECENT NINE OH ONE COMMISSION REPORT. ALL EFFORTS CONCLUDED THAT WE MUST TAKE THE NECESSARY STEPS. TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE FISCALLY STABLE ELECTRIC UTILITIES IN THE STATE WHICH CAN KEEP. THE LIGHTS ON IN ORDER TO PROTECT CUSTOMERS AND OUR ECONOMY. THAT IS THE CRITICAL THING ENSURING THAT CUSTOMERS IN CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. IS STRONG AND CONTINUES TO BE PROTECTED. STILL UTILITIES ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR ECONOMY IN THE NECESSARY BACKGROUND OF OUR DAILY LIVES. CLIMATE CHANGE FOR WHICH WE ALL SHARE RESPONSIBILITY. HAS CREATED A NEW REALITY IN CALIFORNIA. ONE CONSEQUENCE IS THE WILDFIRES WHICH ARE MORE FREQUENT MORE DANGEROUS AND MORE DESTRUCTIVE. IN MANY INSTANCES UTILITIES HAVE FAILED TO MAINTAIN THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE RESPONSIBLY. IN OTHER CASES UTILITIES HAVE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY FILLED INFRASTRUCTURE UNDER INVERSE CONDEMNATION EVEN IF THEY DID NOTHING WRONG. THESE TWO FACTORS THOUGH HAVE COST THE BOND RATING AGENCIES TO DOWNGRADE OUR UTILITIES. ONE WENT TO JUNK BOND STATUS AND THEN BANKRUPTCY ANOTHER FACES THE SAME PLATE THIS SUMMER IF WE DO NOTHING. THE UTILITIES PUBLIC AND PRIVATE MAYBE CLOSE BEHIND AS THE MARKET ACTIONS HAVE CASCADED AFFECT. THIS LEADS TO INCREASE BORROWING COSTS FOR THE UTILITIES. WHEN THEY BORROW AS MAJOR BUSINESSES DO THOSE INCREASES COSTS THOSE INCREASED COSTS WILL INCREASE CUSTOMER COSTS BY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY? THEIR ONLY ALTERNATIVE WILL BE NOT TO OPERATE AT ALL AND GO INTO BANKRUPTCY. AB TEN FIFTY FOUR WILL PAVE THE WAY FOR UNPRECEDENTED SAFETY INVESTMENTS BY THE I. O. U.'S WITHOUT PROFITS. FOR SHAREHOLDERS FOR SAY I USED TO BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR WALL FOR SAFETY RECORD AND PERFORMANCE AND PROTECT CUSTOMERS AND TAXPAYERS FROM HOLY BEARING THE COST OF DEVASTATING WILDFIRES. THIS BILL PACKAGE WILL FACILITATE CUSTOMERS ACCESS TO SAFE RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE POWER BY PROVIDING A DURABLE SOLUTION. TO THE PROBLEMS ARISING FROM UTILITY BECAUSE WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA. THE BILL'S ESTABLISHED A WIDE A NEW WILDFIRE SAFETY DIVISION. INITIALLY WITHIN THE CPUC. NO LATER THAN JANUARY TWENTY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE DIVISION WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE OFFICE OF ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE. SAFETY WITHIN THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY. THE BILLS ALSO ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES AND STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO CUT CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE PROCEEDINGS AND STANDARDS APPLICABLE -- TO THE IMPACT OF THOSE WILDFIRE THOSE WILDFIRES -- CREATE. CREATING A NEW PRUDENT MANAGER STANDARD. AND ESTABLISH A WILDFIRE FUND AND MECHANISMS TO CAPITALIZE THE WILDFIRE FRONT. I'LL NOW TURN OVER TO COUPLE MIKE A JOINT -- AUTHORS WHO WILL -- PERCENT ON VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE BILL OFFERS TURNED TO A MISTER MAYES AND THEN THIS BURKE. THANK YOU OF THE SUMMER HOLDEN I'LL JUST BE A QUICK -- THAT WANTED TO IMPLIFY OF YOUTH SOME OF THE THINGS THAT -- SUMMER HOLDEN WAS -- WAS TALKING ABOUT WE KNOW THAT THESE INCIDENCES ARE OCCURRING -- IT IS WHETHER IT'S A NEW NORMAL MORE TO NEW ABNORMAL A WE KNOW THAT THESE WILDFIRES ARE HAPPENING -- 10% OF ALL LAWS WHAT FAR START IN THE STATE WERE STARTED BY THE MLH UTILITIES ONLY 10%. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH THOUGH THE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS OF THE LAST. TWENTY ADVANCED THE TOP TWENTY EVENTS EIGHT OF THOSE 2240% OF THOSE EVENTS WERE STARTED -- BY ELECTRIC UTILITIES. WHICH ALSO COVER THOSE -- THREE I'LL USE COVER 70% OF THE STATE. SO WE HAVE A CHOICE -- WE LEARNED DURING NINE OH ONE WE HAVE ONE OF THREE OPTIONS -- WE THEIR PRE FUNDED THOSE INCIDENCES WE POST FUND THOSE INTO A FOR THE RECORD AND THEN SAW THE LATER LIKE WE TRY TO DO WITH NINE A ONE OR ALLOW FOR BANKRUPTCY. WE REALIZE BANKRUPTCY IS NOT AN OPTION WE'VE KNOWN THERE'S SOME PROBLEMS WITH WAITING FOR THE EVENTS TO OCCUR AND THEY JUST DOING COST RECOVERY FOR PER RATE PAYERS. SO WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US IS A WAY FOR US TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM -- ON A GOING FORWARD BASIS. I'M EXCEPTIONALLY PROUD TO BE PART OF A TEAM THE THREE OF US HERE THE AUTHORS HI BUT ALSO I'M SEVERAL SENATORS THAT WE WORKED QUITE A BIT WITH AND ALSO -- THE ADMINISTRATION IS TO BE PRAISE WITH THIS AS WELL BECAUSE THIS IS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT IT IS NOT A PERFECT BILL THAT ANYBODY CAN LOOK AT AND SAY YEP THIS IS THE BILL THAT I WOULD WANT. TO TO BE ABLE -- TO TO AUTHOR AND JUST LIKE I WANT OTHER BE A HUNDRED TWENTY DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THIS -- IF THE IF EVERY MEMBER THE LEGISLATURE WAS GOING TO AUTHOR IT BUT WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US. IS A WAY TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM TO ALLOW FOR FINANCIAL STABILITY A WITH OUR LOGIC UTILITIES. I JUST WELL ONE QUICK THING -- IN THIS PROPOSAL BEFORE US BACK IN JANUARY WHEN I INTRODUCED AB TWO THIRTY FIVE WHICH WAS A MY BILL THE CALIFORNIA CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE FUND BILL. WHEN SOMEBODY SAID WELL THEY'LL? WE'RE GONNA MAKE THE SHAREHOLDERS PAY TODAY ABSOLUTELY THERE'S GONNA BE SKIN IN THE GAME WHAT WE INTRODUCED SKIN IN THE GAME. WELL I THOUGHT THAT THAT AMOUNT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THREE BILLION DOLLARS. MADE NO MORE THAN THREE BILLION DOLLARS TURNS OUT THERE'S TEN AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS A SHARE HOLD YOUR HOLDERS. AND THEN SOME. I THINK THIS IS A A A A GOOD NOT BIPARTISAN A BILL IT'S A NON PARTISAN BILL BOTH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS SHOULD BE A SUPPORTING THIS AND OUT OF RESPECT FOR COLLABORATION NOW MY RESPECT. RESPECTFULLY REQUEST TYPE OF THIS BURKE THANK YOU. SEARCH. ON THEIR AGO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATORS I'M TAX WITH THE SAFETY PORTION OF THE BILL AT THIS BILL ESTABLISHES NEW SAFETY ACCOUNTABILITY STANDARDS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF UTILITY BECAUSE WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA. AND PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S FROM SHOULDERING THE COST OF A FIELD ENERGY SECTOR WITHOUT BACK TRACKING ON THE STATE'S CLIMATE GOALS. AB TEN FIFTY FOUR AND ITS COMPANION BILLS WILL ESTABLISH A NEW WILDFIRE SAFETY DIVISION AND ADVISORY BOARD INITIALLY WITHIN THE PC. ARE THE BOARD WILL BE COMPRISED OF EXPERTS EMPIRE PREVENTION AND SAFETY AND WILL BE MORE NIMBLE TO RESPOND TO THE CHALLENGES AS THEY ARISE. COSTS WILL BE INCURRED BY THE COMMISSION FOR ADMINISTRATIVE RESPONSIBILITIES RELATED TO THE DUTIES OF THE BOARD REQUIRING THEM. TO ISSUE SAFETY CERTIFICATES FOR UTILITIES AND STAFF TIME RELATED TO RATE SETTING AND WILD FIRE COST RECOVERY PROCEEDINGS WITH REGARDS TO THE RESPONSIBILITY UTILITIES I'LL USE WILL HAVE TO SPEND FIVE BILLION IN AGGREGATE ON FIRE SAFETY AND MEDICATION OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS. AND SHAREHOLDERS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO EARN A RATE OF RETURN OR PROFIT FROM THIS INVESTMENT. ENCOURAGING INCREASED WHAT WILD FIRE SAFETY SPENDING AND HIGHER UTILITY SAFETY STANDARDS A REDUCE THE OCCURRENCE OF CATASTROPHIC WHILE BY A RESULT IN SAVINGS TO THE STATE AND CONSUMERS. ADDITIONALLY IF THE BILL IT IS SUCCESSFULLY REDUCES FUTURE FIRE RELATED FINANCIAL RISK UTILITY CREDIT RATINGS CAN REMAIN STABLE AND EVEN IMPROVE ACCORDING TO THE LA -- EVERY TIME THE BOND RATING AGENCIES DOWNGRADE THE UTILITIES THERE IS A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN THE COST OF BORROWING FOR THE ELECTRICAL CORPORATIONS. IN ADDITION TO SAVINGS RATE PAYER MONEY THIS BILL TAKES STEPS TO DECREASE THE CHANCES OF FUTURE FIRES INCLUDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SAFETY CERTIFICATION WITH IN THE ADVISORY BOARD THAT REQUIRES UTILITIES TO TIE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TO SAFETY PERFORMANCE. CREATE A SAFETY COMMITTEE WITHIN THEIR BOARD OF DIRECTORS COMPLY WITH THEIR WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS AND PASS A SAFETY CULTURE ASSESSMENT. FURTHERMORE IT CREATES A NEW PRUDENT MANAGEMENT CENTER THAT ALIGNS WITH THAT EFFORT TO PROVIDE MORE CLARITY FOR UTILITIES. THE PROVISIONS OF AB TEN FIFTY FOUR AND ITS COMPANION BILLS WILL I UTILITIES OFFER SAFE AND AFFORDABLE POWER THROUGHOUT THE STATE. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY ENDEAVORS TO MINIMIZE AND PREVENT UTILITY BECAUSE WILDFIRES FROM HAPPENING IN THE FIRST PLACE. IN DOING SO WE CAN PROTECT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA BE FROM BECOMING VICTIMS. NOT ONLY OF THE DEVASTATION AND DESTRUCTION OF WILDFIRES -- CAN CAUSE BUT THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF THE UTILITY COSTS AS WELL THANK YOU RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR I BUILT. THANK YOU YOU HAVE OTHERS IN. RESPONSE CENTERS TO WANNA. YES PLEASE GO FIRST FOR OPPONENTS HERE SO -- ITEM OF THE SCIENTISTS IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN T THE AUTHOR'S REQUEST I WANTED TO TALK THROUGH. THE INSURANCE I'M SORRY THE TWO DIFFERENT FUND US STRUCTURES ARE INCLUDED IN THE MEASURE TO PROVIDE TIME FOR TRANSITION FOR THE MANY ELEMENTS THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE TALKED ABOUT RELATIVE TO SAFETY. AND MITIGATING FIRE RESCUE TAKE HOLD SO -- TO PROVIDE TIME FOR TRANSITION BASICALLY THERE BE ONE OF TWO OPTIONS ONE IS A LIQUIDITY FUND. BILL EQUITY FUND IS THE OPTION THAT WE THINK WILL NOT BE THE CHOSEN ONE PEARL DESCRIBED NONETHELESS BECAUSE IT TEARS THE CHOICE IS IMPORTANT -- SO THE LIQUEFIED ESSENTIALLY PROVIDE -- A LINE OF CREDIT TO UTILITIES TO PAY FOR CLAIMS -- UNTIL THIS IS TERMINATION OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE UP PRUDENT AND WAS% RESPONSIBLE -- FOR FOR PAYMENT OF THE CLAIMS THE THE THE INTERNAL AT THE SHORT TERM LINE OF CREDIT WOULD BE REFUNDED FROM EITHER CONTRIBUTIONS FROM SHAREHOLDERS OR CONTRIBUTIONS FROM -- FROM RATEPAYERS DEPENDING ON WHETHER THE UTILITY WAS PRINT OR WAS NOT PRUDENT. THE SECOND OPTION IS THE INSURANCE FUND THE INSURANCE FUND IS THE OPTION THAT WE THINK WILL BE CHOSEN FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS INCLUDING THE FACT THAT IT'S THE PATH. TO THE CLEAR STANDARD THAT WAS BURKE SPOKE -- TO RELATIVE TO COST RECOVERY AND IT'S ALSO THE PATH TO BE ABLE TO HAVING -- SOME GREATER PREDICTABILITY THE INSURANCE FUND GETS GETS CAPITALIZED WITH -- TO CONTRIBUTIONS ONE IS THE TEN AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS THAT MISTER MAY SPOKE TO FROM GUY UTILITY CONTRIBUTIONS THAT THOSE WOULD COME FROM SHAREHOLDERS AND THEY WOULD NOT BE RECOVERABLE THROUGH RATES. THERE ALSO BE TEN AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS. THAT WOULD BE. MADE AVAILABLE BY THE EXTENSION OF THE RATES THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING PAID FOR THE PARTNER WATER RESOURCES -- RATES THOSE THAT TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE AUGMENTED WITH OTHER MEASURES TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE UP TO FORTY BILLION DOLLARS OF CLAIMS BEING RESOURCES. THE THE THE BIG ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTORS THAT THERE WOULD BE A LIMIT ESTABLISHED ON PAY OUTS OF CLAIMS -- TO TO INSURANCE COMPANIES OF ABOUT 40% AND SO THE AGGREGATE OF THOSE THREE COMPONENTS PROVIDES ABOUT FORTY BILLION DOLLARS OF RAPING RESOURCES. THAT -- THE PROVIDES HERE RUNNING ROOM UNTIL THE MITIGATION STEPS THE HARDENING AND ALL THE OTHER ELEMENTS OF THEY HAVE THE EFFECT OF REDUCING THE FREQUENCY AND ITENSITY OF YOU KNOW UTILITY CALLS WILDFIRES. THERE ARE CAN BE ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE FUN THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED SO IN THE CONTEXT OF YOU KNOW IN ORDER TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE FUND UTILITIES WOULD HAVE TO RECEIVE A SAVE THE CERTIFICATION. AND AND IF THEY ARE PRUDENT MANAGERS THEN. THEN THE FUND WOULD PAY THE CLAIM AND THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL REIMBURSEMENT IF THEY ARE NOT THEN THEY WOULD HAVE TO PROVIDE. A REIMBURSEMENT TO THE FUNDED HAVE TO PAY A DEDUCTIBLE THE DEDUCTIBLE WOULD BE UP TO A CAP IF THEY GENERALLY OR OR YOU KNOW FOR ACTING. IN IN GOOD FAITH IF THEY ARE ACTING IN BAD FAITH WAS THERE IS WILL FULL ACTION THEY WOULD HAVE TO REFUND THE ENTIRETY OF THE CLAIMS PAID OUT BY THE FUND. SO THE MINIMUM CONTRIBUTION. FROM -- SHAREHOLDERS IN THIS CONSTRUCT IS ABOUT TEN AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS IT CAN BE ANOTHER THIRTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS IF THE CAP -- OTHER THE DUCK DOUBLE IS -- IS IS YOU KNOW IS. REACHED AND IT CAN BE GREATER THAN THAT IF THERE'S WILLFUL ACTION ON THEIR PART AND THEY HAVE TO RE RE FUND. THE A 100% OF THE CLAIMS SPADE THAT HOLD THE AMOUNT OF MONEY -- THAT WHOLE CORPUS IS NOT -- IT'S NOT COULD NOT BE RECOVERABLE FROM REPAIR SO THAT'S THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE INSURANCE. ONE AND IN MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE A FEW PEOPLE WHO WERE GOING TO PROVIDE -- TESTIMONY OF VERY BRIEF TESTIMONY OB PATRICK MCCOLLUM WHO'S OF FROM UP FROM THE ASHES I BELIEVE. THIS YEAR OF THAT WE ALSO I BELIEVE ALSO HAVE SCOTT WHICH WITH I. B. W.. AND NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL INDEPENDENT ENERGY PRODUCERS AS WELL HOLD ON BEFORE YOU GO TO YOUR WITNESS SO YOU HAVE A QUESTION MISTER WHITE HOUSE. I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND THE CALIFORNIA RESOURCE CALIFORNIA AND SHE RESOURCE SCHEDULING BECAUSE THERE ARE STAFF REPORT SHOWS THAT THOSE PAYMENT THOSE OBLIGATIONS FOR THOSE SPONSOR PAYING OFF THE CONTRACTS. ARE ARE FILLED UNTIL. TWENTY TWENTY TWO THAT MEANS THAT THAT MONEY WOULD ONLY BE AVAILABLE I GUESS BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE TO TWENTY THIRTY SO THIS THEM. DOES THE MATH WORK OUT IF WE'RE NOT COLLECTING ANYTHING FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS. ON THE ON THE ON OUR SIDE OF THE TEN HAVE BILLION WELL THE DATA WE ARE RECHARGE RIGHT SO YOU CAN YOU PLEDGE OF REVENUES INTO THE FUTURE AND THEN CAN HAVE THE SECURITIZATION ON THE DOLLARS GOD THE BASICALLY THAT'S QUITE BECOMES A QUESTION OF THE SCHEDULING OF THAT. SERVICE -- WITH THE EXTENSION OF THE RATE THE REVENUES WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR PAYING THAT WOULD BE THE THE FOR THE FUN FIRST BECOMES CAPITALIZED WITH A LOAN FROM. THE FROM FROM YEAH AND THEN THAT THAT GETS IN TURN REFUNDED WITH THE BONDS THE ONCE YOU MAKE THEM AVAILABLE INTO THE FUTURE JUST BECOMES A QUESTION OF THE TIMING OF THE OF THE OF THE DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS SO THAT THE W. OUR BONDS ARE SCHEDULED TO BE PAID. OFF -- NEXT YEAR WHEN THEY GO THIS FUNDING STREAM WILL BECOME AVAILABLE SO WE CAN SCHEDULE THE DEBT SERVICE CONSISTENT WITH WHEN THE FUNDS WOULD FLOW SO THE DEBT SERVICE WE COULD. POSSIBLY MEET THE INCOME AND THAT WE'RE GONNA CAN SECURITIZED IT COULD BE BEYOND THE TWENTY THIRTY PERIOD OF THIS THE LIMITATIONS OF THE SPOT RIGHT THE LIMITATIONS ON THIS ON THE STATUE WOULD BE UP TO TWENTY THIRTY SIX IF I RECALL CORRECTLY. TWENTY THIRTY SIX WOULD BE THE OUTSIDE OF THE OUTSIDE PERIOD FOR WHEN THE RATE WOULD BE EXTENDED TO TO PROVIDE COVERAGE -- TO TO KEEP TO PREPAY THE TERRA HALF BILLION DOLLAR BOND IN THE ONE TIME SURPLUS MONEY INVESTMENT FUND THE TWO BILLION THAT WE SORT OF KICK EVERYTHING OFF. THAT GETS REPAID FROM THE I. O. U.'S CONTRIBUTION THE TWENTY TWENTY THREE MONEY WAR. AND THE STATE THE EXPECTATION IS THAT WILL GET REAP REPAID BY THE BY THE BONDS AND AGAIN THE BOND PROCEEDS CAN BECOME AVAILABLE BEFORE THE THE ACTUAL CASH FLOW IT JUST BECOMES A QUESTION OF HOW ONE IS STRUCTURING THE DEBT SERVICE FOR THE UP ON OKAY. AND ONE FINAL QUESTION THREE CHAIR IF THAT'S POSSIBLE -- IS ON THE THE CPUC THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION -- WE HAVE A DON'T KNOW WHAT THE COST TO GOOD TO BE FOR THIS. CALIFORNIA WHILE SAFETY ADVISORY BOARD THE PROCESS OF GOING THROUGH THE CERTIFICATION. I KNOW THAT THE CHAIR OF THE BUDGET SUB TO IS INTERESTED THEY HAVE JURISDICTION OVER P. UC WHAT'S YOUR ESTIMATE NOW ARE WHEN THIS STAFF REPORT WAS TEN IT WAS HIS. MILLIONS. SO IT'S SB ONE ELEVEN AB ONE ELEVEN CONTAIN APPROPRIATIONS TO FUND THE SAFETY FUNCTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH -- THIS MEASURE FOR THE P. YOU SEE AND IT'S A TOTAL FOR BOTH THE PC AND THE RATE PAYER ADVOCATE OF FORTY SIX POINT EIGHT I BELIEVE IT'S LESS THAN FORTY SEVEN MORE THAN FORTY SIX I THINK IT'S FORTY SIX POINT. EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN -- AND DOLLARS IT TO FUND ALL OF THE SAFETY RELATED FUNCTIONS OF IMAGE. AND FINALLY MISTER MISTER SURE THERE'S THERE'S A REQUIREMENT FOR THE UTILITIES TO MAKE CERTAIN HARDENING AND SORT IN CERTAIN WILDLIFE WILDLIFE MEDICATION THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE THERE'S NO. COMMITMENT FROM THE STATE OTHER THAN SB NINE A ONE THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL COMMITMENT FOR THE STATE FOR LONG TERM RESILIENCY PLANNING OR WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT OR ANYTHING ON THE STATE SIDE OF THE FIRE EQUATION. THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL COMMITMENT BEYOND THOSE REFLECTED IN THE pREFLECTED IN THE BUDGET ACT ARE CONSIDERABLE -- WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS AN AREA WHERE THERE IS AN INTEREST IN FUTURE DISCUSSION -- AND THERE THERE'S AND WE WILL LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU -- THROUGH THE BALANCE OF THE SESSION AS WELL AS THROUGH NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET. WITH THEIR ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE DOING WHAT WE NEED TO BE DOING TO MITIGATE AND REDUCE THE RISK AND FREQUENCY OF WILDFIRES I WILL RELISH THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT YOU ON THE SUBJECT. ANYONE ELSE HAVE A QUESTION FOR THEM. TO SEEING NO OTHER HANDS. THE STATE COUNTY -- TO CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON PATRICK MCCALLUM REPRESENTING UP FROM THE ASHES ASHES WITH A GROUP THAT WAS FORMED. AFTER THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN NORTH AY FIRES IT'S THE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FAMILIES THAT HAVE LOST THEIR HOMES DO I OWE YOU CAUSE FIRES IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS. IT'S ALSO THE FORTY ONE LAW FIRMS -- THAT A REPRESENTATIVE OUR LAWYERS SPENT FROM FRIDAY TO SUNDAY. DEEPLY LOOKING TO THIS ANALYZE IN THIS. AND I THOUGHT WE WANT A COMPLIMENT -- SWIMMING HOLDEN SOME WOMEN MAYES AND BURKE SENATOR DODD AND SENATOR HILLS BEEN ACTIVELY LAWCENTER HERTZBERG AND THE GOVERNOR STAFF WE THINK THEY GOT IT RIGHT. AB TEN FIFTY FOUR IS THE BEST HOPE FOR CALIFORNIANS NOT TO GO TO THE DISASTER THAT I AND MY WIFE. THE TWENTY THOUSAND FAMILIES HAVE GONE THROUGH BUT I WANT TO TALK QUICKLY ON THREE OF THE ISSUES NOT ON THE STABILITY TO THE UTILITY. BURKE ON A SAFETY. ON OUR RATE PAYERS IN ON VICTIMS ON SAFETY IF YOU BILL FROM WHAT YOU DID IN SB NINE A ONE YOU TAKE WHAT. JUDGE ELSA DID IN THE CPUC ADOPTED. ONE AREA AND THAT THE WE WERE. MOST CONCERNED ABOUT IS TO MAKE SURE THE SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS ARE GOING ON RIGHT NOW THE TWO FIVE TEN FROM YOUR YEARS FROM NOW IT THAT THEY'RE GOING ON WITH THIS NEW DEPARTMENT THAT'S BEEN CREATED. THEY'RE GONNA HIGHER WHILE FIRE SAFETY STAFF WE CAN BE ASSURED THIS GOES ON IN THE FUTURE IN THIS JUSTIN AND SOMETHING NOW THAT TAKES PLACE WITH THE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IT'S IN PLACE. WITH THE MORE TARGETED ANALYTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS WITHIN IT. WE FEEL MORE CONFIDENT THAT THEY'RE LESS LIKELY FOR OTHER VICTIMS TO GO THROUGH WHAT WE WENT THROUGH. ON RATE PAYERS HIGHLY COMPLICATED BUT WE AND THAT BASICALLY THINK SUBSTANTIAL SAVINGS EVEN IF YOU TAKE THE T. W. R. CAPITALIZATION. THIRTY DOLLARS A YEAR YOU TAKE THAT AS AN INCREASE WHICH SOME PEOPLE WOULD ARGUE. SUBSTANTIAL SAVINGS FOR P. JEANNIE CUSTOMERS. MAJOR SAVINGS FOR EDISON CUSTOMERS. AND MAY BE FLAT TO INCREASE FOR SD ANY CUSTOMERS OF WHAT THEY GET IN LIABILITY IN THE STABILITY IT PROVIDES THEIR BEST RASPY ANY WE CAN WALK THROUGH THE COMPLEXITY ON THAT. BUT AND HOW YOU GET THERE BUT THEY TAKE AWAY THE DEEP THE THE CAPITALIZATION OF SECURITIZATION OUR RATE PAYERS THEY PUT IT ON UTILITY. THEY TAKE AWAY THE PROFIT ON THE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IF WE GOING TO JUMP AND STATUS JULY TWELFTH. THE COSTS GO UP AND IF THERE'S NO FUND MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE WITHIN THE FINE AND FINALLY FOR VICTIMS ARE THREE AREAS IT HELPS VICTIMS. WE ASK FOR LANGUAGE THEY PUT IT IN CPUC HAS TO CERTIFY. THIS IS JUDGE MONTALE GOING ON BANKRUPTCY WITH PD AND THE THAT THAT VICTIMS HAVE BEEN ACCO ADEQUATELY COMPENSATED. ITS LEVERAGE THE PROVIDES LEVERAGE FOR US AND IT P. JEANNIE WANTS TO GET IN THIS FUNDING AT THE MOVE THINK FAST IN BANKRUPTCY YOU HAVE THE TWO JUNE TWENTIETH DAY. THE EVALUATION THE TAKES PLACE. IS WHAT'S GOING TO PAY FUTURE VICTIMS IN ADDISON AND WHAT'S GOING TO PAY FOR FUTURE VICTIMS MPG NAY THE GOOD FOR VICTIMS GOOD FOR SAFETY AND GOOD FOR RATEPAYERS THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOT WHICH SHOULD BE AFTER THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES. THERE'S TWENTY TWO THOUSAND EMPLOYEES AT P. JEANNIE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND RETIREES. FOURTEEN THOUSAND EMPLOYEES IT CALIFORNIA EDISON WITH ANOTHER TWENTY THOUSAND RETIREES THE PROVISION OF THIS BILL THAT WE CARE MOSTLY ABOUT IS THAT IN EXISTING LAW. THERE IS. A REQUIREMENT THAT WHEN THERE IS AN ACQUISITION. OR A MERGER. OF A UTILITY OR TELECOM. THE P. YOU SEE HAS TO DO A REVIEW AND ENSURE THAT RATE PAYERS ARE PROTECTED. THE T.. THE THE A MERGER OR ACQUISITION IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC. THAT IS FAIR AND REASONABLE. TO EMPLOYEES. IN ABOUT FIVE OR SIX OTHER. PUBLIC INTEREST RELATED FINDINGS THAT THEY HAVE TO MAKE. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THAT PROVISION DOES NOT APPLY TO PARTIAL SALES. SO NOW THAT WE HAVE HEDGE FUNDS WHO ARE OWNING AND OPERATING OR UTILITIES. THE FEAR IS THAT THEY WILL START TO CHOP UP AND SELL ASSETS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN CASH. IN THOSE ASSET SALES WON'T BE SUBJECT TO THIS P. YOU SEE REVIEW PROCESS AND FRANKLY WE DON'T CARE IF THEY'RE SELLING TO A PRIVATE OR PUBLIC ENTITY. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT PROCESS. IS -- IS ACHIEVED IN THAT IS IN THE SEA ON PAGE FORTY THREE OF THIS BILL. THAT IS SO IF THERE'S HUGE CAUTIOUS TO OTHER REPAIRS THE P. YOU SEE CAN PULL MONEY OUT OF ANY SALE AND MAKE SURE THAT GOES TO HELP AND TO UNDERWRITE THOSE RATE PAYERS. IF THERE'S NEEDS TO BE WORKER PROTECTIONS IN TERMS OF THE PENSION AND OTHER BENEFITS THE P. YOU SEE CAN GO AHEAD AND IMPLEMENT THOSE AS PART OF THE APPROVAL CURRENTLY T. MOBILE AND SPRINT ARE GOING TO THIS VERY PROCESS. WOULD ES DE JEANNIE AND EDISON PROPOSED MERGER YEARS AGO IT WAS THIS PROCESS THAT THE P. YOU SEE FOLLOWED AND THEN DENIED THE MERGER BECAUSE THEY RULED WASN'T IN THE BEST INTEREST. RATE PAYERS THAT TYPE OF BLUE SKY REVIEW IS CRITICAL WE URGE IN EITHER THANK YOU. OTHERS IN SUPPORT PLEASE COME UP AND DO A ME -- TOO I'M WITH THE INDEPENDENT ENERGY PRODUCERS AND MISTER -- OKAY YEP -- CHANCE BUT HE JONES WITH THE INDEPENDENT ENERGY PRODUCERS AND I WANT TO PRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS LEGISLATION -- ON TO CALIFORNIA ELECTRICAL -- CURRENT LEXICAL NEEDS MY MEMBER COMPANIES PROVIDE A PROVIDE CLEAN ENERGY IS WELLS RELIABILITY PRODUCTS TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON THE MARKET IS A MESS RIGHT NOW -- IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA IS THE LARGEST RATE PAYER OUT THERE WE HAVE ONE UTILITY IN BANKRUPTCY WERE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY CONTRACTS -- THE INDUSTRY HOUSE WITH THE WITH THAT UTILITY WE CANNOT AFFORD ANY FURTHER DEGRADATION OF THE OTHER TWO UTILITIES AND PUBLIC UTILITIES OF I SHOULD POINT OUT ONE OF THEM IS NOW AND NEGATIVE WATCH -- BASED ON FIRE LIABILITY TO THIS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO MEET OUR CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS IN THE FUTURE WHICH IS A REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CAPITAL -- IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CAPITAL FOR RUSSIA HARD THE SYSTEM -- IT IS -- I I CAN'T -- IT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT -- THAT WE STABILIZE THE FINANCIAL SECURITY HERE OF THE UTILITY SO WE CAN MOVE FORWARD AND ADDRESS THIS ISSUE THIS IS ONE COMPONENT OF A VERY COMPLEX PUZZLE BUT IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT ONE TO BAY BASICALLY GET THINGS STABLE SO WE CAN CONTINUE INVESTING CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY FUTURE. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO EVERYBODY ELSE PLEASE DO ME TOO OKAY. CARE MARTIN ST HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES AND ALSO THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS IN SUPPORT. DELANEY HUNTER ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN WIND ENERGY ASSOCIATION A LARGE SCALE SOLAR ASSOCIATION AND THE SOLAR ENERGY INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION ON SUPPORT.

CASSIE GILSON ON BEHALF OF THE OFFICIAL CREDITORS COMMITTEE APPOINTED BY THE US GOVERNMENT IN THE BANKRUPTCY IN SUPPORT. MR GENERALIZATIONS WITH THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION I WANT TO COME UP AT THE TAIL END OF SUPPORT TO SAY THAT THE PROCESS THAT WE'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH WITH EVERYBODY AT THE TABLE. CLEAN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HAS BEEN FANTASTIC WE SUPPORT THAT PROCESS I KNOW IT'S A DIFFICULT SITUATION YOU FIND YOURSELVES IN WERE NEUTRAL THE MOMENT I WANT TO SAY IN GIVE A NICE. COMPLIMENT TO THE FOLKS INVOLVED AT THE TABLE. AND MICHELLE DID YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THE MANUFACTURERS WELL I JUST WANT TO THANK THEM AND APPRECIATE THE WORKING WITH US I KNOW THAT THIS IS BEEN DIFFICULT -- FOR EVERYONE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW THIS BILL CAN KIND OF A COP WHICH A LOT FOR EVERYONE -- BUT I DO THINK THAT THERE'S BEEN A RECOGNITION OF THE OF THE CONSTITUENCY THAT IS BEING REPRESENTED HERE AND WE ARE GOING FORWARD TO TRY TO FIND WAYS. OF RECOGNIZING THAT IN TRYING TO OFFSET SOME OF THE IMPACTS OF THEIR OBVIOUSLY THEIR CUSTOMERS ARE GONNA FEEL. I APPRECIATE YOU -- COMMITTING TO DO THAT GOING FORWARD TO THANK YOU. ARE THOSE IN OPPOSITION YOU WANNA [inaudible] WOODEN. YEAH JUST TO FROM THERE THAT'S FINE -- MY NAME IS MICHAEL GERRY. I AM THE ATTORNEY THAT REPRESENTS UTILITY CUSTOMERS BEFORE THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT IN CALIFORNIA'S WILDFIRE CASE I ALSO TRIED THE CASE. IN WHICH WE WERE ABLE TO SHOW AS THE GENIE WAS NOT PRUDENT. IN CONNECTION WITH RECOVERING FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN FIRES. I'M GONNA SPEAK STRICTLY ABOUT APPROPRIATIONS. AND NOTHING ELSE BUT APPROPRIATIONS. YOU ARE GOING TO BE SIGNING OFF ON ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS. OF ADDITIONAL RATES. FOR UTILITY CUSTOMERS BETWEEN NOW AND THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS [inaudible] UNLESS [inaudible] SOMEHOW. WE DON'T HAVE THE SAME NUMBER OF FIRES. RIGHT NOW THE PROJECTIONS ARE THE FIRES WILL BE EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN WHAT WE'VE ALREADY HAD. SO WHAT YOU'RE BEING ASKED TO INVEST IN. IS THE CREATION OF COMMITTEES. THERE ALREADY IS IN THE CPUC A SAFETY DIVISION. AND THEY'RE VERY VERY GOOD PEOPLE. BUT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN PERMITTED TO DO THEIR JOBS THEY HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE STAFF. YOU HAVEN'T GIVEN THE BUDGET. BAKER DID NOT DO WHAT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO DO AND PEAVEY CERTAINLY DIDN'T DO WHAT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO DO [inaudible] SO. THEN THE QUESTION IS THIS YOU'RE BETTING EVERYTHING ON THIS PIE IN THE SKY. WE'RE GOING TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF FIRES IN THE FUTURE. YOUR VETTING THE ENTIRE WELFARE THE ENTIRE FINANCIAL WELL FOR OF THE STATEOF CALIFORNIA. ON THAT PROVISION. THAT'S VERY SIMILAR. TO WHAT YOU WERE TOLD BACK IN. TWO THOUSAND WHEN YOU SAID THAT THE RATES WHEN THEY SAID THE RATE WE'RE GOING TO GO DOWN IF YOU JUST LET ALL THE GENERATION GO OFF TO THE OUT OF STATE GENERATORS THAT WOULD LOWER THE RATES. AND THAT WAS FALSE THEN. EDIT BANKRUPTED YOU ALMOST THE CITY THE KIDS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT RUINED POLITICAL CAREERS. ANDYOU'RE BEING ASKED TO DO THE SAME THING ALL OVER AGAIN. LAST THING. THE UTILITIES ARE NOT TAKING EVEN AS OF TODAY. ANYTHING YOU'RE DOING TO REDUCE. THE POSSIBILITY OF FIRES I FOUND ON JULY THIRD. I HAVE THE LETTER RIGHT HERE ON JULY THIRD. P. JEANNIE WROTE. AND TELL THE HEAD OF THE SAFETY DIVISION IS IF YOU SEE. THEY HADN'T GOTTEN THE MAINTENANCE DONE ON THE HIGH FIRE AREAS -- IN FOUR HUNDRED DIFFERENT INSTANCES AND THEY JUST WERE GOING TO DO IT BECAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO GET TO IT. AND THEY WERE TOO BUSY IN THE WEATHER WASN'T GOOD THEY COULDN'T FIND THE PEOPLE AND THE LETTERS RIGHT HERE SIGNED. JULY THE THIRD. SO I JUST ASK YOU TO DO THIS. BEFORE YOU BUY THIS PIG IN A POKE. OKAY BEFORE YOU AGREE WITH ASSEMBLYMAN HOLDEN WHO I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR BUT TO WHOSE OFFICE LAST YEAR I WENT TO AN AD BEG THEM. TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT FIRE SAFETY AND THEY SAID NO WE'RE GONNA DO REGIONALIZATION INSTEAD AND THEY WASTE ALL LAST YEAR AND REGIONALIZATION AND SET A FIRE SAFETY I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA STICK TO THE FINANCE. I AM GOING TO STICK TO THE FINANCES BUT MY POINT WHERE FOR THAT ALL RIGHT WELL OF THE FINANCES OF THIS. IF IF IF YOU BELIEVE. THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A REDUCE A REDUCTION -- OF FIRES. THEN THIS WOULD MAKE SOME SENSE. FINANCIALLY. BUT IN ORDER FOR THAT TO HAVE CREDIBILITY YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT'S BEING TOLD TO AND WHETHER THE PEOPLE THAT ARE TELLING YOU THINGS. HAVE CREDIBILITY AND WHEN ASSEMBLYMAN HOLDEN TELLS YOU THAT HE'S BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS THAT'S SIMPLY NOT TRUE. HE WAS WORKING ON REGIONALIZATION ALL LAST YEAR AND YOU KNOW WHAT BECAUSE THAT WAS A BIG ISSUE LAST YEAR SO I JUST ASK YOU PLEASE. BEFORE YOU VOTE FOR THIS. SUBJECT THE REPRESENTATIONS THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE REDUCTIONS IN FIRES TO SOME SORT OF INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS AND NOT JUST BY IT. AS IF THE THE IN A CONSUMER TYPE FRAUD [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. SING THEN RESTORING CASALE YOU HAVE A MOTION FROM A STRIKE CASKEY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. MISTER ROGERS ON THEM THANK YOU AT THE WE'RE GOING TO AND THEN WE'LL COME TO YOU OKAY. GO AHEAD. FIVE PICKING UP ON THE QUESTION ABOUT FIRE SAFETY IN THE ABILITY TO REDUCE OUR BUYERS IN THE FUTURE HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THE REQUIREMENT OF THE UTILITIES TO DO HARDENING. WE HAVE A FIVE BILLION DOLLAR AMOUNT DOUBTS YEAH YOU KNOW STATED HERE GOES THE HARDENING IS THAT REALLY ENOUGH BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW. I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD -- SOME CONTRIBUTION TO THAT THERE WAS GUARANTEED FROM THESE UTILITIES I THINK THAT WE ARE BELIEVE THAT -- WILL GET US A LONG WAY DOWN THE ROAD AND SO -- I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THAT IS SUFFICIENT AT THIS POINT BUT YOU KNOW AS WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE GIVING OUR BEST EFFORT TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO TO STAY AHEAD OF THESE. CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES IN THE IMPACT THAT THEY SEEM TO BE HAVING ON COMMUNITIES. THE RANGERS SEEMS TO BE HUGE FIVE BILLION TO THIRTY BILLION IS ANOTHER NUMBER AND HIM BALFE NOT PLUGGED INTO WHAT WE'RE PROVIDING HERE AND I'D LIKE TO ASK AND IF MY TIME IF I THINK IF EMPLOYERS SAY ON IT. GET IT WOULD YOU RUN OVER THE NUMBERS ONE MORE TIME FOR ME BECAUSE WHEN YOU STARTED YOU SAID TO THE WE HAVE THE INSURANCE FUND WHICH IS GOING TO BE THE PREFERABLE -- VEHICLE IN ITS TEN AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS THAT SHAREHOLDERS. IS TEN I HAVE BILLION FROM THE SURCHARGE AND THEN WE GOT TO FORTY MILLION AND SOMEHOW I MISS WHAT HAPPENED IN BETWEEN THERE. THE FORTY BILLION OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWENTY NINE AND THE FORTY COMES FROM TWO SETS OF THINGS ONE IS BASICALLY. THE VALUE TO CLAIMS PAYING RESOURCES OF CAPPING THE PAY OUTS -- TO INSURANCE THAT ARE RECOVERING COSTS SO THAT'S THE BIG CONTRIBUTOR THE OTHER ONE IS -- IS RE INSURANCE AND THAT IS A SMALLER ELEMENT BUT BUT THAT'S THAT'S HOW WE GET FROM TWENTY ONE TO FORTY BILLION OF CLAIMS PAYING CAPACITY. THEN -- ANOTHER QUESTION BEFORE I TAKE ALL THE TIME. IF STATED IN THE LEGISLATION OR THE ANALYSIS ANYWAY HAT IS RATE PAYER NEUTRAL EXPLAIN HOW THAT HAPPENS Là IN THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE. OF THE RAPIER NEUTRAL COMPONENTS SPEAKS TO THE CONDITIONS THAT P. GENIE IS GOING TO HAVE TO MEET BEFORE HAS ACCESS. TO TO THE FUND SO BEFORE -- P. JEANNIE CAN HAVE ACCESS TO THE FUND -- P. JEANNIE HAS TO HAVE A PLAN OF REORGANIZATION. BY NEXT BY JUNE THIRTIETH OF NEXT YEAR THAT IS APPROVED BY THE COURT AND THAT IS APPROVED BY THE PC. THE UC HAS TO CERTIFY THAT IT MEETS A SERIES OF CONDITIONS INCLUDING THAT IT BE RATE PAYER NEUTRAL THAT IT PROVIDED -- FOR FOR COMPENSATION TO VICTIMS -- IN FULL IN THAT MANNER -- IN THE MANNER -- APPROVED BY THE COURT THAT IT -- THAT PROVIDE THE FOUNDATION -- FOR FOR FOR PGA NEED TO MEET ALL STATE RUN RELEVANT STATE REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING THE OUR PS STANDARDS. AS WELL AS THAT IS -- THE PC CONSIDER THE RAPIER CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR A AND PROVIDES ADEQUATE -- ADJUSTMENTS INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF VALUE SHARING SO THE THE THE THE PLAN HAS TO BE APPROVED BY THE COURT AND THEN THE PC WILL HAVE TO CERTIFY THESE ELEMENTS IN ONE OF THE CERTIFICATION CRITERIA. IS THAT THE RESOLUTION OF THE BANKRUPTCY BE RAPIER NEUTRAL MEANING THAT THE PAYMENTS -- FOR FOR VICTIMS THAT HAS TO BE DONE IN FULL IN A MANNER DETERMINED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT HAS TO COME FROM SHAREHOLDERS OR OTHER ELEMENTS NOT FROM A REPAIR RECOVERY. SO IF THEY DIDN'T MEET THOSE CONDITIONS IT WOULD FALL ON THE SHAREHOLDERS IF THEY DON'T MEET THOSE IF THEY DON'T MEET THOSE CONDITIONS THEY WILL NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE FUND SO THEY THEY THE THIS CREATES BOTH. THE MAN THE CREATES THE PATH FOR THE RESOLUTION OF THE BANKRUPTCY IN A WAY THAT IS FAIR TO RATEPAYERS AND THAT IS FAIR TO VICTIMS AND IT BASICALLY ESTABLISHES THE DEADLINE FOR THAT. IT BASICALLY SAYS IF THEY WANT TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THE TOOLS THAT YOU'D BE PROVIDING IN THIS MEASURE. THEY HAVE -- TO MEET THOSE CRITERIA IF THEY DON'T THEN. THEN THEY THEY DON'T HAVE THE MECHANISM TO THE TOOLS THAT PROVIDE THE STABILITY TO ALLOW THE EXIT OUT OF BANKRUPTCY SO IT'S IT'S A BIG INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO GET THE BANKRUPTCY RESOLVE TO GET THE BANKRUPTCY RESOLVED IN A TIMELY MANNER AND TO DO IT IN A WAY. WE'RE RATE PAYERS AND VICTIMS ARE PROTECTED. BUT MISTER IF I CAN JUST HAVE BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THIS IS THIS POINT IS CLEAR IS THAT ALSO IN REGARDS THE DEED OF YOUR CHARGE THE PORTION TO FIND THIS FROM RATE PAYERS DOESCOME FROM THAT SEARCH CHARGES CAN EXTEND OUT THAT WAS GOING TO EXPIRE. AND THAT DOES EXTEND OUT INTO TWENTY THIRTY SIX YEAH I UNDERSTOOD THAT ONE THANKS THE ASPEN. THIS RAZA. YES ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT I BROUGHT UP -- SINCE EARLY ON IS HOW THE SAFETY CERTIFICATION WOULD WORK -- AND TO ME THAT'S NOT ONLY. THAT OPENS THE DOOR RIGHT TO BE ABLE. TO GET THE GET ACCESS TO THE TO THE FUNDS -- IN A BIG WAY IF YOU HAVE A SAFETY CERTIFICATION THEN IT'S UP. TO WHOEVER. TO PROVE RUN THAT THEY IN FACT DID NOT YOU KNOW -- ACT IN A IN A PRUDENT WAY SO MY CONCERN IS HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WHO. IS MAKING THAT DECISION. HAS TO BE AS INDEPENDENT AS POSSIBLE. AND WHAT IS MADE THE THRESHOLD TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT SAFETY CERTIFICATION IS ALSO A VERY CRITICAL DECISION. AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT NOT ONLY SO THAT THIS DOESN'T BECOME. YOU KNOW I'M EASY LOOPHOLE -- END OF MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR THE TRUST OF THE PUBLIC IS THAT THESE ARE. THESE ARE YOU KNOW ONE WAY OR ANOTHER THESE ARE. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF OF THE TRUST OF THE PUBLIC'S MONEY. SO HOW DO HOW DO WE MAKE SURE AND HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THAT PIECE OF IT. IS REALLY A SOLID AND AS STRONG AS IT NEEDS TO BE. BUT A COUPLE OF ELEMENTS -- THAT AT FIRST THERE'S A NEW -- A NEW DIVISION FOCUSED EXCLUSIVELY ON ON ON ON THE ELECTRICITY -- SAFETY IT STARTS WITH IN THE PC BUT IT. IT'S BECOMES AN INDEPENDENT ENTITY WITHIN THE RESOURCES AGENCY THAT IS EXCLUSIVELY FOCUSED ON THIS. ON THIS ISSUE -- WITHIN TWO YEARS SECOND PIECE IS THERE BE A NEW ADVISORY BOARD OF THAT WOULD BE -- COMPRISED OF APPOINTEES BY THE GOVERNOR THE THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE THAT WILL BE. COMPRISED OF NATIONAL INTERNATIONAL EXPERTS ON ISSUES OF SAFETY AND ISSUES OF OF YOU KNOW UTILITY UTILITY. UTILITY SAFETY AND THE THIS IS A RAPIDLY EMERGING FIELD SO THAT'S PART OF WHY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN ENTITY THAT'S GOING TO BE EXCLUSIVELY FOCUSED ON THIS AS WELL AS BENEFIT FROM THE EXPERTISE OF NATIONAL INTERNATIONAL EXPERTS. THERE WILL BE AN ANNUAL WHILE FAR MITIGATION PLAN THERE WILL BE PROGRESS REPORTS THERE WILL BE A LOOK BACK -- MECHANISM AND THIS WILL BE AN ANNUAL CERTIFICATION PROCESS THAT WILL BE DONE BY THE NEW ENTITY THERE ALSO WILL BE FIELD A LOT IT'S AN ACTUAL VERIFICATION ON THE GROUND OF WHETHER FOLKS ARE DOING WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING. AND IT'S KIND OF A THE THE FIRST YEAR IS GOING TO BE -- IT'S THE FIRST YEAR THE PROCESS IS NOT AS RIGOROUS AS IT IS INFUTURE YEARS JUST BASED ON A REALITY OF WHERE WE ARE. BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF MECHANISMS IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT NOT ONLY ARE THERE ROBUST PLANS FOR THE THOSE PLANS ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED THAT THERE ARE PROGRESS REPORTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT AND THAT THERE'S ON THE GROUND. EXAMINATION OF WHETHER OR NOT THINGS ARE BEING DONE AS THEIR WAS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE. I WOULD JUST ADD TO THAT THAT THE LEGISLATURE STILL HAS OPPORTUNITY DO OVERSIGHT OF THIS PROCESS THERE WILL BE REPORTS THAT WILL COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE THAT WILL HIGHLIGHT AND DELINEATE WHAT KIND OF PROGRESS IS BEING MADE TO WHAT IS HAPPENING AND THEN WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO CALL AND THE FOLKS THAT WE NEED TO AND MAKE SURE THAT. WERE SATISFIED WITH THE KIND OF PROGRESS IS BEING MADE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. YOU'RE GOOD YOU ONCE YOU HAVE ALL YOUR ANSWERS. EARLIER TODAY YOU. ALMOST ALL WEEK. ALL RIGHT MISTER JONES. THANK YOU MISTER CHARGE WANT TO GO BACK A REAL QUICK AND FOLLOW UP ON THE RAY FAIR QUESTION -- IN UNDERSTANDING THAT THE SURCHARGE ON UTILITY CUSTOMERS WOULD BE ASSESSED BASED ON A KILOWATT -- PROPER USAGE. DOES THAT MEAN THAT THERE'S GONNA BE DISPARITY IN RATE PAYERS AND SPECIFICALLY BETWEEN STORE CUSTOMERS AND NON SOBRE CUSTOMERS. RECOGNIZING THAT STILL THERE'S A MINORITY OF ELECTRICAL CUSTOMERS HAVE SOLAR -- BUT THE MAJORITY IS ARE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD IT SO ORG OR DON'T WANT TO CHOOSE TO HAVE SOLAR SO HOW DOES THAT. OUR ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THERE THERE COULD BE A DISPARITY ON THAT. YES THERE IS -- I MEAN I ONE OF THEM. WE WE COULD TALK ABOUT THIS IN FACT EARLY ON WE WERE WE ARE QUESTIONING WHETHER THE DICKS EXTENDING THE W. OUR CHARGE WAS THE PROPER THE PROPER CHARGE. THE CHURCH THE TRUTH IS THIS IS ME TALKING I'M IS THAT IT WAS A PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE -- BACK IN JANUARY FEBRUARY MARCH I HAD SEVERAL PEOPLE COMING INTO MY OFFICE TO TALK ABOUT THIS AND EVERYONE'S AT ALL THE DEED OF YOUR CHARGES EASIEST WAY TO DO IT. WHEN I HAD THROWN OUT THIS IDEA OF DOING A PER METER CHARGE AND MAYBE EVEN ON TRYING TO INCREASE THAT FOR FOR FOR FOLKS THAT LIVE IN THE THE MORE FIRE RISK PRONE AREAS OF SAID HEY GUYS ONCE GO? BRING HIS IDEAS UP BRING IT BACK TO US NOT ONE IDEA -- CAME BACK THE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE WAS EXTENDED AS THE W. ARE DEDUCTED OF YOUR CHARGE AND THE TRUTH IS FOR THE FOR FOR RATEPAYERS FOR COMMERCIAL INDUSTRIAL IT'S IT'S GONNA BE HIGHER THAN IT IS FOR BROTHERS AND FOLKS IN BEEN PLACES. LIKE THE DESERT THAT I REPRESENT THEY ME PAYING MORE THEY CAN BE PAYING MORE THAN THE AT AND THEN THOSE THAT ARE NEAR THE COAST THAT'S THE THAT'S A FACT -- BUT IT IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT -- I IT MAKES THE MOST SENSE AND IT IS THE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE WILL BE ARGUING ABOUT THAT -- IT FOR THE NEXT. YEAR TWO YEARS TO TRY TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING AND THAT WAS THE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE. AT THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE YOUR CLARITY ON THAT AND THEN ALL OF A AND ALSO YOUR OPENNESS. YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S PROBABLY -- YOU KNOW ONE OF MY BIGGEST HANG UPS ON THIS WHOLE CONCEPT IS THE NEEDED WE ARE CHARGING. I THINK FOR ME IT'S IT'S SMARTER -- HE YOU KNOW I REPRESENT A VERY CYNICAL AREA OF THE STATE WHEN IT COMES TO TRUSTING GOVERNMENT AND YOU KNOW THIS IS A CHARGE IT IS. SCHEDULED TO GO AWAY AT A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME AND MY CONSTITUENTS KNOW THAT. AND AT TO COME BACK TO THEM IN STATES BEING EXTENDED FOR SOMETHING THAT WASN'T EVEN ORIGINALLY PUT IN PLACE -- FOR IS KIND OF MAKES IT TOUGH. AND AND I DO APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE SOME OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS THINK ABOUT LIKE SOME OF MY CONSTITUENTS -- AND AND THE QUESTION BEFORE US -- IS IF IT'S NOT THIS THAN THAN WHAT IS IT. IF IT'S NOT -- PRE FUNDING WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE ATTEMPTING TO DO HERE THEN IT'S POST FUNDING WERE WAITING TO THOSE INCIDENTS OCCURS AND THEN THEY'RE GONNA BE PAYING MORE. AND IF IT'S NOT THAT THAT IT'S COMEY BANKRUPTCY AND THEN YOUR REPAIRS ARE GONNA BE PAYING MORE BUT THE FACT IS IF WE DON'T ACT ON THIS TODAY. YOUR RATE PAYERS MY RATE PAYERS WILL BE PAYING MORE WHICH IS WHY I'M SUPPORTING THIS -- AND HAVE BEEN SO AND URGING YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS AS WELL. MR MAJOR MADE MY FINAL CONCLUSION BETTER THAN I COULD HAVE. THANK YOU THIS BURKE YOU WANTED AND I WAS JUST GOING TO BACK TO THE W. R. FEES WE HAVE MET. AS AS THE CO AUTHORS ALL OF MET WITH THE LARGE INDUSTRIAL AND AGRICULTURAL FOLKS AND OBVIOUSLY THEY DID OF YOUR PIECES IT IS A COST THAT THEY DID NOT ANTICIPATE HOW WHETHER. WE HAVE WORKED WITH THEM WE ARE LOOKING AT A LOT OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT WILL HELP OFFSET SOME OF THOSE. SOME O THOSE CHARGES WHETHER THAT IS CUSTOMER GENERATE CUSTOMER REGENERATION AND REMOVING COUNTIES THERE ARE OTHER THINGS ON THE TABLE I THINK THAT ARE. OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO OFFSET SOME OF THAT. OKAY SIGNAL MORE QUESTIONS WE HAVE A MOTION MR HOLDEN WOULD YOU LIKE. TO MAKE A BRIEF CLOSE. A MAKE A VERY BRIEF -- EARLY THIS MORNING -- AND USUALLY I DON'T RESPOND -- TO CRITICISMS BUT I THINK IT'S STILL. PLACE -- WITH MISTER GERRY -- LAST YEAR. I WAS A PART OF A AD HOC COMMITTEE IN THE ASSEMBLY TO LOOK AT THE ISSUES OF WELFARE IN THE IMPACT UTILITIES CAME AND THEY WERE VERY CONCERNED AT THE VIA THE YEAR WE'VE BEEN WORKING. FOR A MISS BURKE AND OTHERS WERE ALSO VERY ENGAGED IN THAT KIND OF A PROCESS AND I COACH HERE. OF THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE ON NINE OH ONE SO. YES WE WERE WORKING ON REGIONALIZATION BUT THIS BECAME MORE IMPORTANT THAN REGIONALIZATION IF YOU WILL -- AND LAST YEAR WE HAD A GOVERNOR WHO. WAS VERY ENGAGED IN THIS AS WELL -- WERE VERY A PRIVILEGE TO HAVE A GOVERNOR THIS YEAR WHO'S JUST AS ENGAGED AND WE'RE TRYING TO PUT FORTH THAT SOAP WAS WAS. ELOQUENTLY. OUTLINED A PROSPECTIVE SOLUTION -- TO INVOLVE THE SHAREHOLDERS IN THIS PROCESS. WHERE THEIR SKIN IN THE GAME? AND THAT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PREDICTABILITY FOR THE RATE PAYERS AND ALSO HAVE A MECHANISM IN PLACE THAT VICTIMS ARE TAKING CARE OF QUICKLY. AND THAT THEY'RE NOT A DRAG THROUGH COURTS AND PUT AT THE BACK OF THE LINE AS THEY ARE CURRENTLY -- AND SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR EUROPE. AND IF I COULD BE BACK ON YOUR COMING I THINK LAST -- OUR PRIOR GOVERNOR WAS FRANKLY MUCH MORE INTERESTED IN REGIONALIZATION -- AT THAT TIME SO -- I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT -- I DON'T THINK ANYBODY -- ASSEMBLY THE SENATE REPUBLICAN DEMOCRAT DOESN'T WANT THIS TO WORK -- I THINK THERE'S A THERE'S A NEED. FOR ACTION IN THIS MISTER MAYES -- PUT IT TO THE ALTERNATIVES -- TO ACTION ARE MUCH MORE SCARY THAN TAKING THIS ACTION TODAY. WHICH I THINK IS A PRUDENT STEPS OBVIOUSLY THE CHAIR -- IS GONNA RECOMMEND AN AYE VOTE AND WE HAVE A MOTION AND WITH THAT WILL. TAKE THE WORLD. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE SENATE FLOOR PORTANTINO HI PORTANTINO I'D BATES. BRADFORD. BRADFORD I'D RAZA. DORADO AYE HILL HILL AYE JONES. JONES NO BY CASKEY. HI MIKE HUSKY I THE BILL WAS OUT. FIVE TWO ONE WITH ONE ABSTENTION RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
