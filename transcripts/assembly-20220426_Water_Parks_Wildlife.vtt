THOSE PARTIES HAD BEEN VERY

01:24:56.391 --> 01:24:58.793
CONSTRUCTIVE VERY HELPFUL AND WE

01:24:58.860 --> 01:25:00.261
FEEL LIKE WE'RE GETTING THERE

01:25:00.328 --> 01:25:02.063

01:25:02.130 --> 01:25:03.131
THE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE

01:25:03.198 --> 01:25:05.033
CONCERNS BUT- JUST A DRILL INTO

01:25:05.099 --> 01:25:06.901
THAT LITTLE BIT- THE CONCERNS

01:25:06.968 --> 01:25:08.403
MOSTLY COME FROM SECTIONS THREE

01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:09.938
AND FOUR OF THE BILL. SECTION

01:25:10.004 --> 01:25:11.372
THREE IS ABOUT THE PERMIT

01:25:11.439 --> 01:25:12.640
ANALYSIS PIECE OF IT AND

01:25:12.707 --> 01:25:14.742
CONCERNS FROM THE OPPOSITION

01:25:14.809 --> 01:25:16.511

01:25:16.578 --> 01:25:18.646
LITTLE LOOSE A LITTLE MORE LIKE

01:25:18.713 --> 01:25:20.181
SEQUEL ANALYSIS THAN WHAT THE

01:25:20.248 --> 01:25:21.983

01:25:22.050 --> 01:25:23.284
LAND USE PLANNING SO WE'VE

WE'RE LOOKING AT A PROVISION

01:25:36.664 --> 01:25:38.066
THAT WOULD- MAKE SURE THAT THIS

01:25:38.132 --> 01:25:39.100
WOULD CREATE ANY NEW CAUSES OF

01:25:39.167 --> 01:25:42.570

OF THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSOR ON

01:31:45.900 --> 01:31:47.335

01:31:49.604 --> 01:31:50.972
LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO

01:31:53.541 --> 01:31:55.243
HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE BILL AS

01:31:55.309 --> 01:31:57.812
IT'S CURRENTLY WRITTEN- AND SO.

01:31:57.879 --> 01:31:59.914
THOSE ARE REALLY LIMITED TO

01:31:59.981 --> 01:32:01.115
SECTIONS THREE AND FOUR OF THE

01:32:01.182 --> 01:32:03.251
BALLOT HAS FOR EXPERTS AS WAS

01:32:03.317 --> 01:32:04.986
EXPLAINED EARLIER- WE'RE

01:32:05.052 --> 01:32:06.921
CONCERNED THAT THIS BILL ON HAS

01:32:06.988 --> 01:32:08.890
WRITTEN IT IMPOSES NEW ANALYSIS

01:32:08.956 --> 01:32:09.924
AND MITIGATION REQUIREMENTS

01:32:09.991 --> 01:32:12.293
RELATED. TO DISADVANTAGED

01:32:16.063 --> 01:32:20.902
HE'S BEFORE THE WATER BOARD. AND

01:32:20.968 --> 01:32:22.336
SO BASICALLY WHAT SECTION THREE

01:32:22.403 --> 01:32:23.971
WOULD DO CURRENTLY IS THAT IT

01:32:24.038 --> 01:32:25.406
WOULD REQUIRE THE WATER BOARDS

01:32:25.473 --> 01:32:26.107
TO CONSIDER AND MITIGATE

01:32:26.173 --> 01:32:27.742
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IMPACTS.

01:32:27.808 --> 01:32:29.477

01:32:31.312 --> 01:32:33.247
WHICH- THE LANGUAGE IS CURRENTLY

01:32:33.314 --> 01:32:34.982
UNCLEAR ON WORKING ON THIS.

01:32:35.049 --> 01:32:36.150
EXTRA WHICH PROJECTS THAT WOULD

01:32:36.217 --> 01:32:37.885
APPLY TO- THERE'S A CONCERN THAT

01:32:37.952 --> 01:32:40.121
WOULD CREATE OVERLAP WITH SYKORA

01:32:40.187 --> 01:32:42.456
IN TERMS OF THE TYPES OF

01:32:43.124 --> 01:32:46.093
WOULD BE REQUIRED- AND- THEN AS

01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:47.461
WE ALL KNOW WHAT SEQUENCE

01:32:47.528 --> 01:32:48.796
SOMETIMES. ARE LEGITIMATE

ASSURE THAT THE AGRICULTURAL

01:38:14.888 --> 01:38:16.824
SEAT ISN'T THE SAME AS THE

01:38:16.890 --> 01:38:17.992

01:38:24.198 --> 01:38:25.132
APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE TO TAKE AND

THE EGR TRIBALS HE DOESN'T HOLD

01:38:31.038 --> 01:38:31.572
UP A QUORUM OF PARTICULAR FOR

01:38:31.639 --> 01:38:33.073
REGIONAL BOARDS AND THAT'S

01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:34.141
REALLY IMPORTANT TO US AS WELL

01:38:34.208 --> 01:38:35.809
WE DON'T WANT TO SEE BOARD

01:38:35.876 --> 01:38:37.278
WITHOUT QUORUMS AND SO WE'RE

01:38:37.344 --> 01:38:38.412
DEFINITELY GOING TO BE EXPLORING

01:38:38.479 --> 01:38:40.114
THAT AND MAKING SURE YOU HAVE A

01:38:40.180 --> 01:38:41.048
MINUTE THERE I'M ON THE ISSUE

01:38:41.115 --> 01:38:43.250
ABOUT THE SEQUEL STOP REAL QUICK

01:38:43.317 --> 01:38:45.052
TO DRILL N ON WHAT WE'RE VISION

01:38:45.119 --> 01:38:46.153
WHAT THE INTENT WAS- THERE

01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:47.454
THERE'S ESSENTIALLY GOING TO BE

01:38:47.521 --> 01:38:50.190
TWO SECTIONS ONE SECTION ISGONNA BE SPUR STATEWIDE AND

01:38:50.257 --> 01:38:51.158
REGIONAL PERMITS AND THE IDEA IS

01:38:51.225 --> 01:38:52.326
REALLY JUST AROUND TRANSPARENCY

01:38:52.393 --> 01:38:53.994
AND SO THE WAY WE ENVISION IT

01:38:54.061 --> 01:38:55.796
IS. A SIMPLE PARAGRAPH OR TWO IN

01:38:55.863 --> 01:38:58.165
IN IN THEIR STAFF REPORT WHAT WE

01:38:58.232 --> 01:39:00.868
WANT THAT PARAGRAPH TO DO IS ONE

01:39:00.934 --> 01:39:01.502
IDENTIFY THE TRADE OFFS IN THE

01:39:01.568 --> 01:39:03.170
APARTMENT OR POLICY SO FOR

01:39:03.237 --> 01:39:04.438
EXAMPLE MAYBE WE'RE NOT

01:39:04.505 --> 01:39:05.339
REQUIRING MONITORING EVERYWHERE

01:39:05.406 --> 01:39:06.407
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE WE WANT

01:39:06.473 --> 01:39:08.475
PEOPLE TO PUT MORE ENERGY INTO

01:39:08.542 --> 01:39:09.843
ACTUALLY IMPROVING THE WATER

01:39:09.910 --> 01:39:11.045
QUALITY RIGHT THERE'S TRADE

01:39:11.111 --> 01:39:12.579
OFFS- SO IDENTIFY THOSE TRADE

01:39:12.646 --> 01:39:14.682
OFFS AND THEN IDENTIFY WAYS TO

01:39:14.748 --> 01:39:16.583
REDUCE THE IMPACT THOSE TRADE

01:39:16.650 --> 01:39:17.851
OFFS HAVE ON ENVIRONMENTAL

01:39:17.918 --> 01:39:19.286
JUSTICE OR TRIBAL COMMUNITIES.

01:39:19.353 --> 01:39:21.288
BOB IT DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY OF

01:39:21.355 --> 01:39:23.190
THOSE TO NECESSARILY- HE PUT

01:39:23.257 --> 01:39:24.358
INTO THE PERMANENT POLICY BUT WE

01:39:24.425 --> 01:39:26.060
WANT TO CISION MAKERS TO KNOW

01:39:26.126 --> 01:39:27.761
HOW THEY CAN REDUCE THOSE

01:39:27.828 --> 01:39:29.363
IMPACTS AND THEN SIMILARLY FOR

01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:31.298
INDIVIDUAL PERMITS LOCAL PERMITS

01:39:31.365 --> 01:39:33.334
WE THERE'S A LOT OUT THERE WE

01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:35.769
DON'T WANT EVERY PERMIT TO HAVE

01:39:35.836 --> 01:39:36.537
TO GO THROUGH THIS ANALYSIS TO

01:39:36.603 --> 01:39:37.938
WEAR TRIMMING IT DOWN. NARROWING

01:39:38.005 --> 01:39:39.640
IT DOWN TO JUST THOSE INDIVIDUAL

01:39:39.707 --> 01:39:41.375
PERMITS ARE GETTING SOME TYPE OF

01:39:41.442 --> 01:39:42.343
EXEMPTION A TIME SCHEDULE ORDER

01:39:42.409 --> 01:39:43.777
THAT EXTENDS OUT THE COMPLIANCE

01:39:43.844 --> 01:39:45.479
DATE A WATER QUALITYVARIANTS

01:39:45.546 --> 01:39:47.081
THAT CHANGES THE STANDARD FOR

01:39:47.147 --> 01:39:48.916
PERMITTING ONLY THOSE FOLKS

01:39:48.982 --> 01:39:50.584
WOULD GET THIS ANALYSIS AND THE

01:39:50.651 --> 01:39:52.820
WAY WE ENVISION IS IT WOULD BE A

01:39:52.886 --> 01:39:54.021
FINDING AND THE FINDING WOULD

01:39:54.088 --> 01:39:55.322
AGAIN SAY WHAT THE TRADE OFF IS

01:39:55.389 --> 01:39:56.890
THE TIME SCHEDULE EXTENSION AND

01:39:56.957 --> 01:40:02.463
THEN SAY THIS MAY. IMPACT ON THE

01:40:02.529 --> 01:40:03.964
COULD. THE COMMUNITY THAT'S IT'S

01:40:04.031 --> 01:40:06.133
BEEN DO. INTO AGAIN NOTHING'S

01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:07.434
BEING REQUIRED FOR. JUST AT THE-

01:40:07.501 --> 01:40:10.137
FINDINGS BE THEY- SO THAT THE

01:40:10.204 --> 01:40:10.771
DECISION. KNOWS WHAT TRY OFFS

01:40:10.838 --> 01:40:12.573
ARE BE MADE BY. THAT'S THE KEY

01:40:12.639 --> 01:40:13.540
AND SO WE'RE TAKING OUT ANYTHING

01:40:13.607 --> 01:40:15.242
THAT LOOKED LAND YOU SEE WILL

01:40:15.309 --> 01:40:17.378
LIKE IT'S JUST WHAT THE WATER

01:40:17.444 --> 01:40:18.011
BOARD'S AUTHORITIES ABOUT- AND

01:40:18.078 --> 01:40:19.179
THEN LASTLY I.

01:40:19.246 --> 01:40:20.280
ALREADY WENT OVER THE LIMIT BUT

01:40:20.347 --> 01:40:23.550
ON THE COST. PART OF IT- AGAIN

01:40:23.617 --> 01:40:24.151
WE'RE TRYING TO. PUT SPECIFIC

01:40:24.218 --> 01:40:25.285
LANGUAGE IN THAT SAYS WE'RE NOT

01:40:25.352 --> 01:40:26.220
RAISING PERMITS FEES. AND THEN

01:40:26.286 --> 01:40:27.888
THERE'S A PROVISION IN THERE

01:40:27.955 --> 01:40:29.923
ABOUT A HARDSHIP STIPEND- WE

01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:30.991
HAVE TO HAVE ANOTHER-

01:40:31.058 --> 01:40:32.760
LEGISLATION TWENTY ONE THIRTEEN.

01:40:32.826 --> 01:40:34.561
THAT LOOKS AT TAKING MONEY FROM.

01:40:34.628 --> 01:40:35.562
OTHER STATE WATER BOARDS

01:40:35.629 --> 01:40:38.532

THAT HARDSHIP FUND FOR THIRD

01:40:39.633 --> 01:40:41.602
PARTIES TO BE ABLE TO. LANGUAGE

01:40:41.668 --> 01:40:44.071

01:40:47.141 --> 01:40:49.076
COMMUNITY IT'S NOT BE ABLE TO

01:40:49.143 --> 01:40:49.943
PARTICIPATE IN REGULATORY

01:40:50.010 --> 01:40:51.145
PROCESS. THAT FUNDING WOULD BE

01:40:51.211 --> 01:40:52.346
AVAILABLE TO HELP THEM SO THAT

01:40:52.413 --> 01:40:54.248
THEY COULD BE. AVAILABLE SO

REGULAR. IF THE REST OF THE

01:41:07.194 --> 01:41:08.195
ISSUE IS REALLY MORE ABOUT

01:41:08.262 --> 01:41:09.430
WANTING TO MAKE SURE CERTAIN

01:41:09.496 --> 01:41:11.098
TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE MET OUR

01:41:11.165 --> 01:41:12.966
FINDINGS ARE MET WHY THE EXTRA

01:41:13.033 --> 01:41:15.135
ADDED COMPONENTS WHY HAVE THE

01:41:15.202 --> 01:41:17.704
EXTRA SEATS AT THE TABLE IF YOU

01:41:17.771 --> 01:41:18.806

ADDRESSED WHAT DO YOU NEED THE

01:41:21.208 --> 01:41:24.445
EXTRA. WELL I. MEAN I THINK THE

01:41:24.511 --> 01:41:26.580
HEART OF THE BILL IS THE

01:41:26.647 --> 01:41:27.848

THIS IS WE'VE SPOKEN ABOUT THERE

01:41:29.383 --> 01:41:30.651
HAS BEEN A LACK OF

01:41:30.717 --> 01:41:31.652
REPRESENTATION ON THESE BOARDS

01:41:31.718 --> 01:41:33.353
IN THE PAST WE FEEL IT'S

01:41:33.420 --> 01:41:34.154
APPROPRIATE THAT THE COMMUNITIES

01:41:34.221 --> 01:41:35.589
THAT ARE MOST IMPACTED BY THESE

01:41:35.656 --> 01:41:37.191
WATER BODIES ASIANS DO HAVE

01:41:37.257 --> 01:41:38.525
REPRESENTATION THERE SO I THINK

01:41:38.592 --> 01:41:40.027

01:41:40.093 --> 01:41:41.962

THE SECTION IS. SOMEWHAT

01:41:42.963 --> 01:41:44.965
SEPARATE- BUT REALLY THE INTENT

01:41:45.032 --> 01:41:46.266
THERE IS AGAIN JUST TO HAVE THE

01:41:54.107 --> 01:41:55.042
NOTHING'S PREVENTING THEM FROM

01:41:55.108 --> 01:41:57.544
NOT AUTHORIZING IT WE JUST WANT

01:41:57.611 --> 01:41:58.679

THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL BOB THIS

02:21:22.006 --> 02:21:23.708
IS I THINK A VERY IMPORTANT

02:21:23.775 --> 02:21:25.643
MOMENT FOR US IN CALIFORNIA IS

02:21:25.710 --> 02:21:27.579
CERTAINLY AN IMPORTANT MOMENT.

02:21:27.645 --> 02:21:30.682
FOR ME AS A LEGISLATOR WE HAVE A

02:21:30.748 --> 02:21:33.084
REAL PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA WITH

02:21:33.151 --> 02:21:35.353
THE ISSUE OF WATER AND GETS THE

02:21:35.420 --> 02:21:37.055
RESPONSIBILITY OF EVERY ONE OF

02:21:37.121 --> 02:21:39.691
US HERE TO CAREFULLY CONSIDER

02:21:39.757 --> 02:21:40.925
AND TRY TO ANALYZE THE

02:21:40.992 --> 02:21:44.028
SITUATION. AND MY CONCERN IS

02:21:44.095 --> 02:21:47.098
THAT. OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL

02:21:47.165 --> 02:21:49.334
HAS SIMPLY MISREPRESENTED WHAT

02:21:49.400 --> 02:21:52.036
THIS BILL DOES. IF YOU READ THE

02:21:52.103 --> 02:21:54.305
LETTER IN OPPOSITION IT ALMOST

02:21:54.372 --> 02:21:56.274
EXCLUSIVELY FOCUSES ON THE FACT

02:21:56.341 --> 02:21:58.042
THAT THIS TAKES LOCAL CONTROL

02:21:58.109 --> 02:22:00.578
AWAY. AND SOMEHOW IMPLIES IT

02:22:00.645 --> 02:22:02.780
GOES TO THE STATE. AND THAT'S

02:22:02.847 --> 02:22:05.350
JUST A MISREPRESENTATION AND SO

02:22:05.416 --> 02:22:06.818
FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE STILL

02:22:06.885 --> 02:22:09.287
UNDECIDED ABOUT THIS BILL I HOPE

02:22:09.354 --> 02:22:10.755
YOU WOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER.

02:22:10.822 --> 02:22:14.125
THAT THERE IS A AN INCENTIVE FOR

02:22:14.192 --> 02:22:18.496
PEOPLE WHO. EXTRACT WATER- UP TO

02:22:18.563 --> 02:22:20.798
UP ALWAYS OPPOSE ANYTHING THAT

02:22:20.865 --> 02:22:22.033
MIGHT AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO

02:22:22.100 --> 02:22:24.002
TAKE WATER OUT OF THESE IN

02:22:24.068 --> 02:22:25.837
IMPORTANT OVER DRAFTED

02:22:25.904 --> 02:22:29.607
AQUIFER'S. BUT IN THIS SITUATION

02:22:29.674 --> 02:22:32.043
WE HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF YEARS

02:22:32.110 --> 02:22:34.612
WITH CIGNA TO TRY TO FIND OUT

02:22:34.679 --> 02:22:36.147
WHAT'S WORKING AND WHAT'S NOT

02:22:36.214 --> 02:22:39.751
WORKING AND WE SIMPLY HAVE ONE.

02:22:39.817 --> 02:22:42.120
AREA WHERE WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

02:22:42.186 --> 02:22:43.388
THE GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY

02:22:43.454 --> 02:22:45.556
AGENCIES ARE IN CHARGE OF TRYING

02:22:45.623 --> 02:22:46.691
TO GET THE BASINS INTO

02:22:46.758 --> 02:22:48.893
SUSTAINABLE YIELD AND YET THEY

02:22:48.960 --> 02:22:53.765
DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO.

02:22:53.831 --> 02:22:55.900
DEAL WITH THE NEW WELLS THAT ARE

02:22:55.967 --> 02:22:59.003
GOING IN SO YOU HAVE THOUSANDS

02:22:59.070 --> 02:23:00.571
IN CALIFORNIA THOUSANDS OF NEW

SUSTAINABILITY AGENCY IS TRYING

02:23:05.777 --> 02:23:07.812
TO GET THAT BASIN AND SO THIS

02:23:07.879 --> 02:23:09.347
BILL DOES JUST ONE SIMPLE THING

02:23:09.414 --> 02:23:11.115
COMMITTEE STAFF IN THEIR

02:23:11.182 --> 02:23:13.451
ANALYSIS SAID WE HAVE A

02:23:13.518 --> 02:23:15.053
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM. AND THAT IS

02:23:15.119 --> 02:23:16.821
WE HAVE A DISCONNECT BETWEEN

02:23:16.888 --> 02:23:18.790
THOSE WHO ARE MANAGING THE BASIN

02:23:18.856 --> 02:23:20.558
FOR SUSTAINABLE YIELD. OKAY AND

SAME TIME YOU CUTE YOU JUST IT

02:23:27.532 --> 02:23:29.901
JUST MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT IF

02:23:29.968 --> 02:23:31.502

02:42:14.658 --> 02:42:18.495
BASINS. THIS DOESN'T- THIS

02:42:18.562 --> 02:42:20.130

02:42:20.197 --> 02:42:21.531
TERMS OF DECISIONS OF WATER

02:42:21.598 --> 02:42:23.366
AFTER TO MAKE IT REALLY IS

02:42:23.433 --> 02:42:25.836
FOCUSED ON THE AREAS WHERE THERE

02:42:25.902 --> 02:42:28.038
IS A GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY

02:42:28.105 --> 02:42:29.473
AGENCY THAT'S BEEN CREATED BY

02:42:29.539 --> 02:42:31.608
THE STATE BECAUSE THE STATE HAS

02:42:31.675 --> 02:42:33.643
A CONCERN. ABOUT THE OVERDRAFT

02:42:33.710 --> 02:42:34.878
PROBLEMS OF THAT PARTICULAR

02:42:34.945 --> 02:42:37.214
AQUIFER SO HOW DOES THIS HOW DO

02:42:37.280 --> 02:42:39.082
YOU ADDRESS THE FACT THAT UNDER

02:42:39.149 --> 02:42:41.017
SIGMA SIGMA AUTHORIZES THE GSA'S

02:42:41.084 --> 02:42:42.486
TO IMPOSE SPACING REQUIREMENTS

02:42:42.552 --> 02:42:44.988
ON A NEW WELL CONSTRUCTION- TO

02:42:45.055 --> 02:42:47.824
MINIMIZE THE WELL INHERENT.

02:42:47.891 --> 02:42:50.093
CONFLICTS THAT MAY ARISE- IT

02:42:50.160 --> 02:42:52.462
SEEMS LIKE GSA'S DUE TO THEIR

02:42:52.529 --> 02:42:53.997
WORK- WITH OFTEN ONLY ODDER

02:42:54.064 --> 02:42:56.166
ALTERING BUT THE FOCUS ON LOCAL

02:42:56.233 --> 02:42:57.767
CONTROL DOES SEEM TO BE LOST HOW

02:42:57.834 --> 02:42:59.402
DO YOU ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR

02:42:59.469 --> 02:43:01.805
ISSUE WELL I AGAIN. I'M A IF YOU

02:43:01.872 --> 02:43:03.373
DON'T MIND THE TERMS OF THE

02:43:03.440 --> 02:43:04.941
RESPONSE I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT'S

02:43:05.008 --> 02:43:07.444
LOCAL CONTROL LOS THIS DISTRICT

02:43:07.511 --> 02:43:09.980
IS THE GSA'S ARE LOCAL SO IT'S

02:43:10.046 --> 02:43:12.482
NOT LOCAL CONTROL LOST NUMBER

02:43:12.549 --> 02:43:14.484
AUTHORIZES JUST SPACING. THAT

02:43:14.551 --> 02:43:17.420
DOES NOT AUTHORIZE- HE YOU KNOW

02:43:17.487 --> 02:43:20.023
HE IS THE WELL CONSISTENT WITH

02:43:20.090 --> 02:43:22.192
THE WITH THE GSA'S. END RIGHT

02:43:22.259 --> 02:43:23.894
NOW THE COUNTIES ARE AT A

02:43:23.960 --> 02:43:27.597
MINISTERIAL LEVEL AND MANY GSA'S

02:43:27.664 --> 02:43:29.866

OTHER REQUIREMENTS THEY BEEN

02:43:32.869 --> 02:43:34.571
FOCUS ON THESE OTHER THINGS YET

02:43:34.638 --> 02:43:37.607
I THINK WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES

02:43:37.674 --> 02:43:38.175
A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION. IS

02:43:38.241 --> 02:43:40.911
SHOULD WE BE ON RECORD AS SAYING

02:43:40.977 --> 02:43:43.079

WHERE THE COUNTY IS NOT EVEN

02:43:51.721 --> 02:43:53.957
ALLOWED TO DO- A SIGNIFICANT

02:43:54.024 --> 02:43:55.692
REVIEW THEY HAVE TO FOLLOW THE

CALIFORNIA TODAY WE WERE. ONE OF

02:44:14.945 --> 02:44:17.581

THE WIN WE DIPLOMA PASSED

02:44:19.816 --> 02:44:20.784
YESTERDAY. WE SHOULDN'T BE ONE

02:44:20.850 --> 02:44:22.586
OF THE LAST STATES THAT ALSO

02:44:22.652 --> 02:44:25.722

02:44:25.789 --> 02:44:27.657
WELLS MINISTERIAL THE APPROVED.

02:44:27.724 --> 02:44:29.859
IN A NIGHT I'M I REALLY

02:44:29.926 --> 02:44:31.228
APPRECIATE THE SINCERITY OF THE

02:44:31.294 --> 02:44:33.029
QUESTION BECAUSE I WOULD JUST

02:44:33.096 --> 02:44:34.464
OFFER IN VENTURA COUNTY. WE

02:44:34.531 --> 02:44:36.733
ACTUALLY DID THIS WE SAID NO NEW

02:44:36.800 --> 02:44:40.503
WELLS- TEN AM IMPLICATED WE CAME

02:44:40.570 --> 02:44:42.973
UP WITH THIS. AND IT WAS

02:44:43.039 --> 02:44:45.875
BITTERLY FOUGHT. UNTIL WE DID.

02:44:45.942 --> 02:44:47.477
AND WHEN WE DID IT EVERYBODY

02:44:47.544 --> 02:44:49.512
SAID IT WAS THE BEST THING THAT

02:44:49.579 --> 02:44:51.147
HAPPENED. BECAUSE THEY WERE

02:44:51.214 --> 02:44:53.850
CONCERNED THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW.

02:44:53.917 --> 02:44:55.719
ONE FARMER DID KNOW HOW TO SAY

02:44:55.785 --> 02:44:57.721
TO THE OTHER FARMER HEY AB I

02:44:57.787 --> 02:44:58.888
DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD PUT THAT

02:44:58.955 --> 02:45:02.025
WELL AND- BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA

02:45:02.092 --> 02:45:04.728
FACT MY FAR. CAN THEY WERE THEY

02:45:04.794 --> 02:45:05.362
WERE SORT OF LOOKED BUT THIS

02:45:05.428 --> 02:45:08.832
JUST STAB. A FRAMEWORK WHEN WE

02:45:08.898 --> 02:45:09.899
DID THAT AND I VIEW THE

02:45:09.966 --> 02:45:11.534
OPPOSITION. COMING

02:45:11.601 --> 02:45:12.936
UNDERSTANDABLY FROM THE EXACT

02:45:13.003 --> 02:45:16.539
SAME SPOT. AND I HAVE HAD I HAD

02:45:16.606 --> 02:45:18.775
DOZENS OF AG INTERESTS COME UP

02:45:18.842 --> 02:45:20.844
TO ME AND SAY I COULDN'T SAY IT

02:45:20.910 --> 02:45:23.013
AT THE TIME. I'M REALLY GLAD YOU

02:45:23.079 --> 02:45:23.880
DID THAT BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY

02:45:23.947 --> 02:45:25.181
AFFECTING OUR ABILITY. EVEN

02:45:25.248 --> 02:45:26.216
THOUGH THEY WERE SPACED IT WAS

02:45:26.283 --> 02:45:28.518
AFFECTING OUR ABILITY AND YOU

02:45:28.585 --> 02:45:31.187
YOU FIND IT LOTS OF AG INTEREST

02:45:31.254 --> 02:45:32.989
IN LOTS OF OTHER PEOPLE WHO. ARE

02:45:33.056 --> 02:45:34.991
TERRIFIED THAT TOO MANY NEW

02:45:35.058 --> 02:45:36.526
WELLS ARE GOING TO GO AROUND

02:45:36.593 --> 02:45:38.795
THEM AND IT'S GOING TO AFFECT

02:45:38.862 --> 02:45:39.963
THEIR ABILITY. THIS JUST SAYS

02:45:40.030 --> 02:45:43.433
GSA'S PLAY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

02:45:43.500 --> 02:45:44.701
NOT AT THE STATE LEVEL GSA'S

02:45:44.768 --> 02:45:47.804
PLAY A LOCAL ROLE HERE IN TRYING

02:45:47.871 --> 02:45:49.439
TO HELP. DEAL WITH THAT

02:45:49.506 --> 02:45:51.775
SITUATION AND THAT'S WHY I THINK

02:45:51.841 --> 02:45:54.110
AT A MINIMUM I REQUEST GIVE US A

02:45:54.177 --> 02:45:55.412
CHANCE TO LET THE AMENDMENTS

02:45:55.478 --> 02:45:57.047
ACTUALLY COME OUT OF LEDGE

02:45:57.113 --> 02:46:00.383
COUNCIL. THEN WE CAN HAVE A- A

02:46:00.450 --> 02:46:03.386
MORE ROBUST ANALYSIS OF THIS

02:46:03.453 --> 02:46:05.088
BILL AND ALL THE AMENDMENTS

02:46:05.155 --> 02:46:06.823
WE'VE ALREADY TAKEN AS WE'VE

02:46:06.890 --> 02:46:08.591
TRIED TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD.

02:46:08.658 --> 02:46:10.493
RIGHT AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND

02:46:10.560 --> 02:46:12.228
I DO I. I BELIEVE THAT'S A VERY.

02:46:12.295 --> 02:46:13.997
DIRECT AND SINCERE ANSWER BUT I

02:46:14.064 --> 02:46:15.799
THINK THE PROBLEMATIC ISSUE

02:46:15.865 --> 02:46:17.901
BECOMES WITH THE GSA'S AT THE

02:46:17.967 --> 02:46:19.569
LOCAL LEVEL THEY START UP

02:46:19.636 --> 02:46:21.271
TRUMPING LOCAL LAND RIGHTS THE

02:46:21.338 --> 02:46:22.906
OVERLYING LANDOWNER HAS A RIGHT

02:46:22.972 --> 02:46:24.574
TO THE WATER WITH. WHICH IS

02:46:24.641 --> 02:46:26.409
UNDERNEATH HIS PROP OR FOR

02:46:26.476 --> 02:46:28.545
PROPERTIES AND THAT THE THERE IN

02:46:28.611 --> 02:46:31.548
LIES THE PROBLEM THAT YOUR BILL

02:46:31.614 --> 02:46:32.449
SETS FORTH. YOU HAVE ANOTHER

02:46:32.515 --> 02:46:34.351
COUNTY MADERA I'LL JUST MENTION

02:46:34.417 --> 02:46:35.618
THAT ALREADY IN LITIGATION

02:46:35.685 --> 02:46:36.920
BECAUSE WHAT THEY'VE DONE IN

02:46:36.986 --> 02:46:38.822
THEIR GSA IS THEY'VE TAKEN THE

02:46:38.888 --> 02:46:40.724
OVERLYING RAIN WATER THAT FALLS

02:46:40.790 --> 02:46:42.592
ON THE LAND AND- HAVE TOLD THE

02:46:42.659 --> 02:46:44.561
PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT FORMING ON

02:46:44.627 --> 02:46:45.895
THAT LAND. THAT THAT WAS THAT

02:46:45.962 --> 02:46:48.798
WATER THAT FELL ON THEIR LAND.

02:46:48.865 --> 02:46:50.834
THEY'RE ONLY ENTITLED TO. TEN OR

02:46:50.900 --> 02:46:54.671
AS MUCH AS 25% OF THAT WATER IS

02:46:54.738 --> 02:46:56.840
WHAT THEY CAN USE FOR THEIR LAND

02:46:56.906 --> 02:46:58.108
ALL THE REST HAVETO BE ROUTED

02:46:58.174 --> 02:47:00.143
OVER TO THOSE WHO ARE CURRENTLY

02:47:00.210 --> 02:47:05.115
ARE GETTING. THAT SEEMS LIKE A

02:47:05.181 --> 02:47:05.982
TO TAKING TO ME. AND I THINK

02:47:06.049 --> 02:47:07.717
THAT THAT BECOMES THE THAT

02:47:07.784 --> 02:47:08.918
HAPPENS WE THIS BILL. IT BECOMES

02:47:08.985 --> 02:47:11.287
AN EXTENSION OF THE TAKING OF

02:47:11.354 --> 02:47:11.955
WATER RIGHTS FROM ONE AND GIVEN

02:47:12.021 --> 02:47:14.057
TO ANOTHER AND THAT'S WHAT THIS

02:47:14.124 --> 02:47:14.958
BILL IS SETTING FORTH IT ALSO

02:47:15.024 --> 02:47:16.860
SETS FORTH WHAT. POTENTIALLY CAN

02:47:16.926 --> 02:47:18.628
BECOME AN OUTRIGHT MORATORIUM ON

02:47:18.695 --> 02:47:20.964
ACTIONS IN TIME WHILE IT MAY NOT

02:47:21.030 --> 02:47:23.566
SIGNING IT OVER THE IMMEDIATE

02:47:23.633 --> 02:47:26.703
MOMENT. OVER TIME IT WILL. IF I

02:47:26.770 --> 02:47:28.638
COULD ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF. IT TWO

02:47:28.705 --> 02:47:29.639
THINGS THAT PICKED THE

02:47:29.706 --> 02:47:30.707
GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY

02:47:30.774 --> 02:47:34.411
AGENCIES. GENERALLY ARE HAVE A

02:47:34.477 --> 02:47:36.212
VERY STRONG REPRESENTATION FROM

02:47:36.279 --> 02:47:39.449
THE AG INTEREST- AND THEY'VE

02:47:39.516 --> 02:47:41.050
MADE IT ALL THE ONES THAT I'VE

02:47:41.117 --> 02:47:43.286
BEEN EXPOSED TO SO IT'S NOT LIKE

02:47:43.353 --> 02:47:44.154
WE HAVE A HOSTILE AGENCIES OUT

02:47:44.220 --> 02:47:46.089
THERE BUT WE DO WE MAKE WE HAVE

02:47:46.156 --> 02:47:48.758
AND SEE IF WE AYE WE MAY HAVE

02:47:48.825 --> 02:47:50.193
HAD AND IN SOME SITUATIONS- BUT

02:47:50.260 --> 02:47:51.060
HOLES THIS DOES IS THE

02:47:51.127 --> 02:47:52.061
GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY

02:47:52.128 --> 02:47:53.930
AGENCY. HAS TO VERIFY THAT IT

02:47:53.997 --> 02:47:56.199
DOESN'T VIOLATE THE POLICIES

02:47:56.266 --> 02:47:57.734
THAT THEY HAVE AT THIS

02:47:57.801 --> 02:48:00.403
PARTICULAR TIME IT DOESN'T ALLOW

02:48:00.470 --> 02:48:03.072
THEM TO TAKE AWAY WATER RIGHTS

02:48:03.139 --> 02:48:05.542
FOR EVERYBODY IT IT JUST SIMPLY

02:48:05.608 --> 02:48:08.244
HAS THAT- BUT BUT AT SOME POINT

02:48:08.311 --> 02:48:10.213
IN TIME. THAT MAY BE A

02:48:10.280 --> 02:48:11.347
PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCE WHICH

02:48:11.414 --> 02:48:13.516
IS MANAGED SHOULD SHOULD ALL

02:48:13.583 --> 02:48:16.386
WILL STAY MINISTERIAL. NO MATTER

02:48:16.453 --> 02:48:17.921
HOW BAD THE SITUATION GETS NO

02:48:17.987 --> 02:48:20.156
MATTER HOW MUCH NEGATIVE IMPACT

02:48:20.223 --> 02:48:22.125
IT COULD BE SHOULD DO SHOULD THE

02:48:22.192 --> 02:48:23.960
WELL STATE MINISTERIAL FOR THE

02:48:24.027 --> 02:48:26.062
BENEFIT OF THE PRIVATE PROPERTY

02:48:26.129 --> 02:48:29.165
RIGHT OWNER THAT IS THERE AT

02:48:29.232 --> 02:48:31.401
SOME POINT IN TIME. I WE HAVE TO

02:48:31.468 --> 02:48:32.969
SAY AT LEAST LET US HAVE THE

02:48:33.036 --> 02:48:40.743
GSA'S WAY IN END TO OFFER A PATH. THAT'S WHERE WE BACK TO THE

OVER IMPOSING STATE MANDATES AND

02:48:45.849 --> 02:48:47.083
I THINK NOW WE'RE TRYING TO

02:48:47.150 --> 02:48:48.952
TRUMP THAT AND GIVE A LITTLE

02:48:49.018 --> 02:48:50.553
HIGHER READY TO. PRIORITY TO THE

02:48:50.620 --> 02:48:52.689

03:07:56.632 --> 03:07:58.233
TO SERVICES BECAUSE OF LAYER

03:07:58.300 --> 03:07:59.935
UPON LAYER OF LOCAL ORDINANCES

03:08:00.002 --> 03:08:01.837
AND LAW ENFORCEMENT PRACTICES

03:08:01.903 --> 03:08:03.939
THAT SWEEP ENCAMPMENTS. BUT

03:08:04.006 --> 03:08:05.607
BEYOND THE CIVIL AND HUMAN

03:08:05.674 --> 03:08:07.209
RIGHTS IMPLICATIONS WE BELIEVE

03:08:07.275 --> 03:08:09.344
THIS BILL WILL ALSO FAIL TO

03:08:09.411 --> 03:08:09.945
ACCOMPLISH ITS STATED GOAL OF

03:08:10.012 --> 03:08:11.513

03:08:13.882 --> 03:08:15.350
STATED PEOPLE HAVE NOWHERE TO GO

03:08:15.417 --> 03:08:16.918
OUR SHELTER AND HOUSING SYSTEMS

03:08:16.985 --> 03:08:18.553
ARE BEYOND CAPACITY PEOPLE WHO

03:08:18.620 --> 03:08:19.755

CONNECTED WITH HOUSING AND WE

03:08:26.161 --> 03:08:26.895
ALSO BELIEVE THAT SWEEPING

03:08:26.962 --> 03:08:28.363
ENCAMPMENTS FUNCTIONALLY MAKES

03:08:28.430 --> 03:08:30.499
HOMELESSNESS WORK WORSE. BY

03:08:30.565 --> 03:08:32.868
DESTABILIZING PEOPLE- REMOVING

GOVERNMENTS HOWEVER WHAT WE'RE

03:08:42.844 --> 03:08:44.780
NOT SUGGESTING IS TO ACCEPT THE

03:08:44.846 --> 03:08:46.748
STATUS QUO THE MOST EFFECTIVE

03:08:46.815 --> 03:08:47.949

03:08:50.986 --> 03:08:52.487
WOULD END THEIR HOMELESSNESS

03:08:52.554 --> 03:08:54.089
AFFORDABLE HOUSING SERVICES AND

03:11:04.386 --> 03:11:06.288
RIVER HERE IN SACRAMENTO INDEED

03:11:06.354 --> 03:11:07.222
MANY OF OUR PARK LANDS ACROSS

03:11:07.289 --> 03:11:09.591
THE STATE- INCLUDING SOME IN MY

03:11:09.658 --> 03:11:11.293
DISTRICT AS WELL- THIS IS

03:11:11.359 --> 03:11:12.360
SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN VEXING

03:11:12.427 --> 03:11:13.895
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ABOUT HOW TO

03:11:13.962 --> 03:11:16.431
RESPONSIBLY ENGAGE AND ASSESS

03:11:16.498 --> 03:11:19.501
AND REMEDIATE- ENCAMPMENTS THAT

03:11:19.568 --> 03:11:21.536
ARE FRUSTRATING TO THOSE THAT

03:11:21.603 --> 03:11:22.904
CARE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT AND

03:11:22.971 --> 03:11:23.839
CERTAINLY PRESS WRITTEN TO THE

03:11:23.905 --> 03:11:27.275
GENERAL COMMUNITY AT LARGE- I AM

03:11:27.342 --> 03:11:28.710
ALL BALL JUMP AHEAD TO SAY THAT

03:11:28.777 --> 03:11:30.145
I DON'T FEEL THAT I'M IN A

03:11:30.212 --> 03:11:31.780
POSITION TO SUPPORT THE BILL

03:11:31.847 --> 03:11:33.782
TODAY. I DON'T WHILE THE COUPLE

03:11:33.849 --> 03:11:34.416
QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT- YOU

03:11:34.482 --> 03:11:36.551
KNOW BE INTERESTED IN ANSWERING-

03:11:36.618 --> 03:11:38.019
THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE IS THAT I

03:11:38.086 --> 03:11:40.155
KNOW AND WE KNOW THIS FROM MY

03:11:40.222 --> 03:11:42.123
OWN I KNOW THIS FROM MY OWN

03:11:42.190 --> 03:11:43.158
EXPERIENCE IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT

03:11:43.225 --> 03:11:44.626
THAT THERE ARE BETTER PATHWAYS

03:11:44.693 --> 03:11:46.561
TO BE ABLE TO DO JUST THAT TO

03:11:46.628 --> 03:11:48.163
ENGAGE INDIVIDUALS TO RESOLVE

03:11:48.230 --> 03:11:49.965
HOMELESSNESS WHERE IT SAT TO

03:11:50.031 --> 03:11:51.132
HELP ASSIST THEM ON THE RIGHT

03:11:51.199 --> 03:11:53.668
PATH WAYS WE NEED DO A BETTER

03:11:53.735 --> 03:11:55.237
JOB AND THAT TOO IT DOES NOT

03:11:55.303 --> 03:11:57.272
DISCOUNT THE CRISIS THAT WE HAVE

03:11:57.339 --> 03:11:59.007
IN FRONT OF US AND SOME OF THE

03:11:59.074 --> 03:12:01.109
IMPACTS ARE HAVING BOTH

03:12:01.176 --> 03:12:01.877
ENVIRONMENT INTO THE GENERAL

03:12:01.943 --> 03:12:02.344
COMMUNITY. AND THAT'S

03:12:02.410 --> 03:12:05.080
FRUSTRATING- I AM CONCERNED THAT

03:12:05.146 --> 03:12:07.249
THIS BILL IS DRAFTED IS GOING TO

03:12:07.315 --> 03:12:10.986
BE- EITHER- YOU DON'T RENDER

03:12:11.052 --> 03:12:13.388
MOOT TO OR OTHERWISE ON DONE

03:12:13.455 --> 03:12:15.323
BUYING THAT FEDERAL BOISE MARTIN

03:12:15.390 --> 03:12:17.692
VERSUS BOISE DECISION- I KNOW

03:12:17.759 --> 03:12:18.960
THAT THEIR AMENDMENTS IN HERE

03:12:19.027 --> 03:12:21.129
THAT- I THINK IS DRAFTED YOU

03:12:21.196 --> 03:12:22.764
KNOW YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO

03:12:22.831 --> 03:12:25.333
PROVIDE NOTICE TO- TO CAMPERS TO

03:12:25.400 --> 03:12:26.902
BE ABLE TO PRESERVE AND STORE-

03:12:26.968 --> 03:12:29.704
PERSONAL PROPERTY- AND ALSO THAT

03:12:29.771 --> 03:12:31.940
YOU KNOW SERVICE WORKERS AND-

03:12:32.007 --> 03:12:33.108
THOSE POINTING INDIVIDUALS

03:12:33.174 --> 03:12:36.011
TOWARDS. WOULD BE AVAILABLE- TO

03:12:36.077 --> 03:12:39.281
HELP THEM- QUOTE- EVERY EFFORT

03:12:39.347 --> 03:12:41.049
SHALL BE MADE TO BE ABLE TO DO

03:12:41.116 --> 03:12:43.852
THESE AND IT SAYS IT IT'S A BIG

03:12:43.919 --> 03:12:44.719
ENOUGH THAT I'M WORRIED THAT NAY

03:12:44.786 --> 03:12:47.055
ON BOISE WILL STILL UNDO- AND A

03:12:47.122 --> 03:12:49.758
LOG WITH THIS INTENTION AS WELL.

03:12:49.824 --> 03:12:54.663
AND THEN YOU MORE BROADLY. I

03:12:54.729 --> 03:12:56.331
WONDER WHY WE WOULD EVEN NAY THE

03:12:56.398 --> 03:12:56.965
TO HAVE DOESN'T NEED OF A SPY.

03:12:57.032 --> 03:12:59.267
PART PLAN. AT ALL I THAT FOR

03:12:59.334 --> 03:13:00.735
MINE POSITION AND YOU CAN CALL

03:13:00.802 --> 03:13:01.937
ME IF I'M WRONG. LOCAL

03:13:02.003 --> 03:13:02.971
GOVERNMENTS HAVE THE ABILITY TO

03:13:03.038 --> 03:13:04.973
MANAGE THE PARK PLANS HAVE THE

03:13:05.040 --> 03:13:08.410
ABILITY TO- ENFORCE ORDERS.

03:13:08.476 --> 03:13:10.111
UNDER BOISE SUBJECT TO THE

03:13:10.178 --> 03:13:11.313
CONDITIONS BE IN PLACE THAT

03:13:11.379 --> 03:13:12.948
THERE IS A ALTERNATIVE AND

03:13:13.014 --> 03:13:15.517
POSITIVE PATHWAY TO RESOLUTIONS.

03:13:15.583 --> 03:13:16.117
SO I'M NOT SURE THAT WE EVEN

03:13:16.184 --> 03:13:17.986
NEED THESE OTHER NATIONS BECAUSE

03:13:18.053 --> 03:13:19.087
I BELIEVE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

03:13:19.154 --> 03:13:20.188
ALREADY HAVE THE EMPOWER MEN IF

03:13:20.255 --> 03:13:22.257
THEY ARE DOING THINGS THE RIGHT

03:13:22.324 --> 03:13:24.292
WAY- SO FOR THOSE REASONS I WILL

03:13:24.359 --> 03:13:25.760
LIKELY BE OPPOSING THIS BILL I

03:13:25.827 --> 03:13:28.396
WELCOME- THE FEEDBACK YOU HAVE

03:13:28.463 --> 03:13:29.731

AGAIN DON'T- DISAGREEING WITH

03:13:32.467 --> 03:13:35.103
DEAN- THE INTERESTS AND- THE

03:13:35.170 --> 03:13:36.304
SOLUTIONS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

03:13:36.371 --> 03:13:38.039
FIND- TO BE ABLE TO HAVE YOU

03:13:38.106 --> 03:13:39.674
KNOW A HEALTHY BALANCE WITH WITH

03:13:39.741 --> 03:13:41.476
THOSE THAT THAT WANT- HEALTHY

03:13:41.543 --> 03:13:45.113
OPEN SPACES AS WELL FOR THEIR-

03:13:45.180 --> 03:13:49.951
PUBLIC ENJOYMENT. THE RESTAURANT

03:13:50.018 --> 03:13:52.120
. I'M SURE IT HAD BEEN VERY

03:13:52.187 --> 03:13:54.823
CLOSE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER WORKS

03:13:54.889 --> 03:13:56.358
COMMENTS I'M JUST ON THE OTHER

03:13:56.424 --> 03:13:58.026
OF THE LINE WHICH IS I'M IN A

03:13:58.093 --> 03:13:59.995
I'M GONNA SUPPORT THIS BILL

03:14:00.061 --> 03:14:01.229
MOVING FORWARD- BUT THE ONE AREA

03:14:01.296 --> 03:14:03.898
THAT I WOULD THE- LITTLE.

03:14:03.965 --> 03:14:06.067
RESERVE MY VOTE ON THE FLOOR ON

03:14:06.134 --> 03:14:07.302
IS TO THE EXTENT THAT THE

03:14:07.369 --> 03:14:10.338
AUTHORS. ARE ABLE TO MAKE SOME

03:14:10.405 --> 03:14:13.041
CLARIFICATIONS AND MODIFICATIONS

03:14:13.108 --> 03:14:15.076
I THINK WE HAVE A WE HAVE A HUGE

03:14:15.143 --> 03:14:17.078
CHALLENGE WITH THE WHOLE

03:14:17.145 --> 03:14:19.247
HOMELESS- SITUATION HERE AND I

03:14:19.314 --> 03:14:21.082
REALLY APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY

03:14:21.149 --> 03:14:23.118
OF- THE GENTLEMAN THAT THAT CAME

03:14:23.184 --> 03:14:25.286
AND JUST SO YOU KNOW THE BILL

03:14:25.353 --> 03:14:26.421
HAS ALREADY BEEN CHANGED. THE

03:14:26.488 --> 03:14:28.056
WORD ILLEGAL HAS BEEN TAKEN OUT

03:14:28.123 --> 03:14:29.557
AND IT'S BEEN CHANGED ON

03:14:29.624 --> 03:14:32.594
PERMITTED SO VIEW ACCOMPLISH AT

03:14:32.660 --> 03:14:33.862
LEAST ONE OF ONE ONE OF YOUR

03:14:33.928 --> 03:14:39.434
GOALS. BUT THAT BALANCE BETWEEN-

03:14:39.501 --> 03:14:42.070
PROTECTING OR PRESERVING SOME

03:14:42.137 --> 03:14:45.740
OPEN SPACE AREAS- AND- STILL

03:14:45.807 --> 03:14:48.243
HAVING PLACES FOR PEOPLE WEEK WE

03:14:48.309 --> 03:14:50.578
CAN'T SIMPLY CRIMINALIZE. BEING

03:14:50.645 --> 03:14:52.380
HOMELESS AND I KNOW THAT'S NOT

03:14:52.447 --> 03:14:54.182
YOUR JANET ALL BUT WE HAVE TO

03:14:54.249 --> 03:14:56.117
MAKE SURE WE HAVE PLACES AND SO

03:14:56.184 --> 03:14:58.286
I'M HOPEFUL WHEN I READ THE
