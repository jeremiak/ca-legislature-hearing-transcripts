WELL GOOD MORNING ARM AND- VERY PLEASED THAT YOU GUYS WERE HERE TO HEAR MY BILL OF WHAT SECOND DAY OF THE NEW SESSION SO THANK YOU-FOR THAT SB FIFTY SEVEN IS TRULY OF FROM MY PERSPECTIVE A VERY SIMPLE FIX TO WHAT HE IS A COMPLICATED PROCESS THAT ALLOWS INDIVIDUALS TO OPT IN FOR VOTER REGISTRATION OUT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES DMV INSTEAD OF AUTOMATICALLY BEING REGISTERED TO VOTE OR HAVING TO OPT OUT OF THE PROGRAM. I IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE IT YOU KNOW THE FEDERAL NAY IN ALL VOTER REGISTRATION ACT REQUIRED EACH STATE YOU OFFER VOTER REGISTRATION SERVICES AT A MYRIAD OF STATE RUN OFFICES LIKE THE DMB OR OTHER OFFICES THAT OFFER PUBLIC ASSISTANCE HOWEVER THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DID NOT DICTATE HOW THAT PROCESS SHOULD OPERATE FOR TWENTY THREE YEARS CALIFORNIA HAD OFTEN VOTER REGISTRATION THAT WORKED WELL AND CERTAINLY DID NOT HAVE MAJOR ISSUES HOWEVER IN TWENTY SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA CHANGES MOTOR VOTER LAW TO INSTEAD REQUIRE. VIGILS TO ACTUALLY OPT OUT OF VOTER REGISTRATION EVEN IF THEY HAD PREVIOUSLY REGISTERED AND DIDN'T NEED TO RE REGISTER AND IT AUTOMATICALLY TRANSFERRED THAT INFORMATION FROM THE DMV TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE. THE INFORMATION THAT TRANSFERRED IS NOT CHECKED FOR ELIGIBILITY BUT AUTOMATICALLY ADDED TO THE VOTER ROLLS AFTER THE DMB IMPLEMENTATION IN MAY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE PUBLIC STARTED HEARING ABOUT. ISSUES THAT WERE DEVELOPING THE LA TIMES REPORTED THAT A SOFTWARE ERA. AFFECTED SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND VOTER REGISTRATIONS IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE FACT BE REPORTED THAT THE DIEM BE TRANSMITTED TWENTY THREE THOUSAND AROUND THE US VOTER REGISTRATIONS. IN OCTOBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE LA TIMES REPORTED THAT THE STATE AGENCY MISTAKENLY REGISTERED ANOTHER FIFTEEN HUNDRED INELIGIBLE RESIDENTS INCLUDING NON CITIZENS. IN FACT SOME OF CALIFORNIA'S IMMIGRANT RIGHTS GROUPS TESTIFIED AGAINST AB FOURTEEN SIXTY ONE. BECAUSE OF THIS EXACT CONCERNED THEY CORRECTLY FEARED THAT UNDOCUMENTED PERSONS WOULD BE SWEPT INTO THE VOTER SIT DOWN WHEN THEY WERE PERTAINING DRIVERS ARE. BOTH IN JANUARY TWENTY NINETEEN THE SACRAMENTO BEE REPORTED THAT ELECTION OFFICIALS KNEW THAT THE MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM WASN'T READY TO BE LAUNCH AND YET- IT WENT AHEAD ANYWAY. ALSO IN AUGUST TWENTY NINETEEN THE ASSESSMENT PRODUCED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOUND OUT ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND RECORDS SHOWED A DISCREPANCY. THE VOTERS STATED POLITICAL AFFILIATION AN ADDITIONAL EIGHTY THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHT FOUR REGISTRATIONS HAD DUPLICATES. THE REPORT ALSO CONFIRM THAT VOTER REGISTRATIONS ARE NOT VERIFIED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE. STORY PUBLISHED IN THE SACRAMENTO BEE IN AUGUST ONE NIGHT REPORTED THAT CALIFORNIA THE LAND. THAT WERE ADDED TO THE ROOT VOTER ROLLS BY MISTAKE ACTUALLY WILL BE ON THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN GENERAL. EVEN JUST RESET LIAM. I JUST ONE MONTH AGO DECEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN AT LEAST SIX HUNDRED CALIFORNIANS FOUND THAT THERE VOTER REGISTRATIONS HAD BEEN UNEXPECTEDLY CHANGE WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT AND I WILL SHARE WITH YOU THAT MY OFFICE RECEIVED A NUMBER. OF COMPLAINTS OR CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THEY WERE CURRENTLY REGISTERED IN WE DID DIRECT THEM TO OUR LOCAL REGISTRAR OF VOTERS. THESE ARE GRIEVOUS ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BECAUSE IT'S VERY CLEAR FROM THE LET ME THAT I'VE SHARED WITH YOU TODAY THE MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM ISN'T WORKING OUT THAT WAS INTENDED. EARLIER THE SERGEANTS DISTRIBUTED TO YOU A COPY OF SCREEN SO THE VOTER REGISTRATION PROCESS THAT THE D. V. FROM OCTOBER TWELFTH NINETEEN. IF YOU'LL DIRECT ATTENTION TO JUST PAGE TWO THIRDS AND ASKS WHAT ARE BEST DESCRIBES YOU IN IS HERE THAT I BELIEVE THE ERRORS REALLY OCCUR AND CERTAINLY I IN MY OWN EXPERIENCE IDEA GO TO GET A NEW DRIVER'S LICENSE DECEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. ARE I WAS CONCERNED HEARING THE PROBLEMS THAT THERE WASN'T A BOX THERE FOR ME TO SAY I DON'T NEED TO REGISTER I AM REGISTERED AND YOU KNOW LET ME GO ON TO THE REST OF THE APPLICATION THERE IS NOTHING. THAT WE ON THERE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO DO THAT I ACTUALLY CHECKED THE SECOND BOX WHICH SAYS. I AM REGISTERED TO VOTE AND WANT TO UPDATE MY VOTER REGISTRATION INFORMATION JUST BECAUSE THAT WAS THE ONLY THING THAT CAME CLOSE. TO MY PARTICULAR SITUATION I'VE BEEN JUST. TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD. AND ARE ARE THAT CAME BACK TO ME AFTER I CHECKED THAT BOX IT BASICALLY SAID YOU'RE NOW REGISTERED AS ROOT. CANALS OF DECEMBER TWENTIETH NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND I BEEN REGISTERED LIKE I SAID SINCE WAY BACK IN TWO YEARS AGO. SO. IF WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO READ SURE NOT. BE I THINK WE NEED TO DO. SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T COMPROMISE THE INTEGRITY OF INTEGRITY OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. HAS LAW I THINK THAT THE SIMPLE. SOLUTION HERE IS JUST OUT OF FOURTH BULLET TO THAT PAGE TO THAT SAYS I AM ALREADY REGISTERED TO VOTE PLEASE DO NOT EDIT OR CHANGE MY CURRENT REGISTRATION I'M COMFORTABLE OR I'M HAPPY WITH THAT HOWEVER YOU WANT THAT. TO ME THAT IS THE SIMPLEST FIX TO SOMETHING IS CREATED HAVOC ARE WITH THE REGISTRATION SYSTEM IN IN OUR STATE AND I'M NOT HERE TO BLAME ANYBODY I THINK YOU KNOW WE ALL KNOW THE COMPUTERS DO WHAT THEY DO. ARE WE HAVE PROBLEMS IN OUR OWN PERSONAL LIVES BUT THIS PARTICULAR COMPUTER PROGRAM IN PARTICULAR SCREENSHOT DUST DOESN'T MATCH WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO SAY. ABOUT THAT PRESSURES ARE. ITEM THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE AND TO VOTE IN THE PARTY OF PREFERENCE EMAIL PREFERENCES. ARE AND OUT SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS VERY VERY SACRED AND WE SHOULD HONOR- EACH INDIVIDUAL AND THIS IS NOW NO ATTEMPT IN ANY FASHION. DO NOT GET PEOPLE TO REGISTER TO VOTE WE WERE HANDLING COMPLAINTS FROM ALL PEOPLE IN OUR DISTRICT WHETHER THEY WERE IN P. P. DEMOCRAT REGISTRANT OR REPUBLICAN. AND THEY ALL HAVE CONCERNS SO I THINK IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE DO SOMETHING ODD TO FIX THE SYSTEM AND WITHOUT. I AM VERY PLEASED TO HAVE SENATOR MORE LOCK- TO TESTIFY ON ISSUES THAT HE HAS FOUND WITH THIS AND ARE HERE TO STAY. AND DANCE MORE OF THE INSTITUTE FOR FAIR ELECTIONS IS JOINING ME TO GIVE HER COMMENTS. YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COLLEAGUES FIRST OF ALL I JUST WANT TO SAY MISTER CHAIR. YOU LOOK GREAT. I'M JUST FOLLOWING YOUR LEAD RIGHT RIGHT SO HANDSOME I'M SO IMPRESSED. SO WE CALL THE ROLL. LEADING THE WITNESS TO SAY. I AM PLEASED TO JOIN SENATOR BATES SAYS CO AUTHOR OF SB FIFTY SEVEN IN THE PRESENT THIS BILL TO YOUR COMMITTEE- AS A NATURALIZED U. S. CITIZEN ARE YOU BELIEVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE IS VERY SACRED SO THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE TO ME- IT IS EXTREMELY. EXTREMELY DISTURBING THAT THE MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM IS A MESS. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM WAS RUSHED AND PREMATURE. AND NOW TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE BEEN INCORRECTLY REGISTERED TO VOTE. THIS SERIOUS MISTAKE HAS PLACED THE INTEGRITY OF CALIFORNIA SELECTIONS AT STAKE. I STARTED GETTING A LOT OF CONSTITUENTS. REQUEST BACK IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO ON THE BREAK IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN I PULL UP HERE AND I MET PERSONALLY WITH ALEX VIDEO. OUR SECRETARY OF STATE AND I SAID I'M I'M GETTING A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM IN APRIL AND WE WENT THROUGH A LONG. DISCUSSION IN HIS OFFICE ON HOW EVERYTHING WOULD BE FINE EVERYTHING WAS TAKEN CARE OF THERE WOULD BE NO. NO GIPSON GAPS SERVER OR FAUX PAS- BUT YET WITHIN MONTHS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MOTOR VOTER- WE STARTED SEEING A LOT OF ISSUES AND NEWSPAPER REPORTS. EVEN AFTER BEING ASSURED THAT EVERYTHING WOULD BE FINE WITH WITH SHORTLY AFTERWARDS TWENTY THREE THOUSAND RONI'S MOTOR VOTER REGISTRATIONS WERE FOUND AND FROM THAT POINT I AM I'VE I'VE JUST BEEN VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE INTEGRITY OF THE PROCESS AND I WROTE MISTER PURDY AND SAID. WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION YOU A SHIRT MADE THAT THIS WOULD NOT OCCUR. AND NOW IN FACT IT HAS. AND THE ONGOING DISCOVERIES OF END OF IT MALFUNCTIONS ARE MADDENING THE ARTICLES ARE IN THIS AYE I WAS. EMAILING WITH ONE CONSTITUENT YESTERDAY AND EYES HE SENT ME AN ARTICLE I SAID THANK YOU AND THEN HE'S LIKE BUILD UP MY WEBSITE OR MY WITH MY TERMINAL PAGE WITH ALL AN ARTICLE ARTICLE ARTICLE ARTICLE JUST. GOES ON IT'S EMBARRASSING FOR THE STATE TO HAVE HAD SOMETHING LIKE THIS OCCUR WITH SB FIFTY SEVEN IT OFFERS A COMMONSENSE APPROACH TO REMEDY THIS CRITICAL PROBLEM WITH THE MOTOR VOTER REGISTRATION PROCESS. A SIMPLE OPT OUT OPTION. RATHER THAN AN OPT. OUT OPTION. WILL HAVE HELPED PREVENT ANOTHER CRITICAL BREACH OF OUR ELECTION SYSTEM. VOTERS TO SELF CERTIFY THEY ARE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE WILL HELP ESTABLISH MORE ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE ELECTION PROCESS. AND HELP CREATE ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARDS. SB FIFTY SEVEN WILL PREVENT FUTURE REGISTRATION MISTAKES AND RESTORE VOTER CONFIDENCE IN THE INTEGRITY. OF OUR ELECTIONS. MISTER CHAIR. FOR LEGISLATORS- WE DON'T RUN THESE DEPARTMENTS- BUT- WE'RE THE ONES THAT ARE CONTACTED WHEN SOMETHING GOES WRONG SO SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO. DO LEGISLATION THAT TELLS DEPARTMENTS HOW BEST TO- OPERATE CERTAIN FUNCTIONS I'M SORRY THAT THE DIRECTOR THE DMB AND SECTOR STATE HAVING ALREADY AND IMPLEMENTED SOMETHING. LIKE THIS THAT MAKES IT A LITTLE MORE USER FRIENDLY BUT I THINK SB FIFTY SEVEN IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE PURSUING THE SEND THE MESSAGE THAT. THIS SHOULD BE DONE A LITTLE MORE APPROPRIATELY BECAUSE IT REFLECTS ON ALL HUNDRED AND TWENTY LEGISLATORS AND BE ELECTED STATEWIDE OFFICES SO WITH THAT MISTER CHAIR. WITH THE VERY DISTINGUISHED AND HANDSOME BEARD I WOULD DOUBT. KILEY REQUEST TO SUPPORT FOR SB FIFTY SEVEN THANK YOU CENTER MORE LOG- JUST A QUICK QUESTION BEFORE WE TURN THE WITNESS CENTER BATES YOU YOU SAID THIS WOULD SIMPLY ADD A FOURTH BOX WHAT WITH THAT FOURTH BOXY I'M SORRY. IT WOULD SAY- I'M ALREADY REGISTERED TO VOTE PLEASE DO NOT EDIT OR CHANGE MY CURRENT REGISTRATION. IN THAT SECTION THAT ASKS WHAT BEST DESCRIBES YOU. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THAT SECTION IAN THAT ARE HAND OUT AND THERE'S NOTHING THAT BEST DESCRIBES SOMEONE. WHO'S ALREADY REGISTERED AND LIKES OF THE PARTY OR THE NOT NO PARTY THAT THEY'RE IN. AND THEY'RE READY TO GO ON THE NEXT SHOT SCREENSHOT THAT ALLOWS THEM TO GET A NEW DRIVER'S LICENSE OR REGISTRATION OR CHANGE YOUR ADDRESS WHATEVER GOES AFTER THAT AND I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU. CHAIRMAN ON BURKE WHEN I WAS AT THE DMV I WENT THERE SPECIFICALLY TO TEST HOW WE WERE DOING AND WE WERE DOING BETTER. I IN TERMS OF LINES I GOT IN LINE I DIDN'T HAVE AN APPOINTMENT SENT ME TO THE COMPUTER TO FILL OUT THE APPLICATION. I'M STANDING NEXT TO AN ELDERLY GENTLEMAN AND HE IS BACKING UP OUT OF THE HIS LITTLE CUBICLE BECAUSE HE'S TOTALLY CONFUSED. AND I SAID MAY I HELP YOU SIR BECAUSE HE WAS VERY DISTRESSED AND HE SAID I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO SO. I AM A LIFELONG REGISTERED HE DIDN'T TELL ME AS PARTY ANY SAID I DON'T FIND ANYTHING UP HERE THE LET ME TO DO THAT. ME SO I THINK I NEED TO START OVER AND I SAID NO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME BACK AND THAT FORTY MINUTE LOT. DO WHAT I'M DOING IT. THE THIRD QUESTION WHICH SAYS I'D LIKE TO UPDATE MY RESTRICTION YEAH EVEN PLEADED SO THE QUESTION IS CAN USING EVERYBODY. AND THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO OPT OUT WITH QUESTION AND THEN THE THIRD QUESTION THE PHONE THERE NOW. BUT IT IS NOT CLEAR THAT. YOU DON'T WANT YOUR REGISTRATION CHANGE IN ANY FASHION YOU'RE ALREADY READ. N FULL SIMPLE TO ME. BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE SIMPLE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO HAVE LEGISLATION SO AND I'VE ALREADY SHARED THIS. STORY MANY MANY TIMES AT HERE WE ARE. WITH THE REGGAE XIN THAT OF THAT ACTUALLY SAYS. ARE I WANT TO. YOU DON'T WANT TO BE REGISTERED IN THAT. SOME THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE ALLOWED IN DOUBTS IN THERE BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR WAY ON THE SECOND PAGE AND THE TIME THEY GET THEIR THERE THEY'RE TOTALLY CONFUSED. YEAH I WAS CONFUSED I'M SUPPOSED TO BE WELL VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE IN THIS WHOLE THING AND THE GENTLEMAN NEXT TO ME. I WAS VERY TO USE AND WANTING TO GO ON WITH IT SO REGISTRATION. CONCERNED BECAUSE- IN ME TO SPEAK TODAY MY NAME IS AND ON SOME MORE- AND I'M PRESIDENT OF THE INSTITUTE FOR FAIR ELECTIONS WE ARE FIVE OH ONE C. THREE ORGANIZATION THAT ANALYZES AND MONITORS THE QUALITY AND INTEGRITY OF VOTER DATABASES DATABASES AS YOU ALL KNOW ARE DYNAMIC AND COMPLEX THE LARGER THE FILE THE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE THEY ARE TO UNINTENTIONAL ERRORS. AND OF COURSE EXTERNAL MANIPULATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE IN% AS WE'VE ALREADY HEARD TODAY I'M- IN JUNE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN PRIMARY IN CALIFORNIA AS MANY AS SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND. OF VOTERS IN THE STATE SYSTEM OR AN ADVERT LEAD DUPLICATED BY THE DMV AND LA COUNTY. ALSO IN THAT SAME PRIMARY A HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN THOUSAND VOTERS WERE LEFT OFF A FREESYNC ROSTERS. DUE TO EMERGE ERROR. A HUNDRED THE THOUGHT I THINK IT'S CLOSER TO HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND HAD POLITICAL PARTY MISTAKES OR RE ATTRIBUTIONS. MANY STUDIES OVER TIME AND I WILL CITE THE CAL TECH AND MY TEA VOTING TECHNOLOGY PROJECT REPORT IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE- THAT THEY DID WITH ORANGE COUNTY- MANY STUDIES OVER TIME HAS SHOWN THAT GENERATING AUDIT DATA IS NECESSARY TO EVALUATE VOTER FILE QUALITY AND ALEXIAN INTEGRITY. AUDIT DATA ALSO SERVES TO HELP IMPROVE ADMINISTRATION PRACTICES. KEEP IN MIND THAT AUDITS DO NOT JUST NEED TO HAPPEN AFTER THE FACT THEY COULD AND SHOULD BECOME PART OF A DAILY PROCESS MAYBE EVEN MINUTE BY MINUTE. CALIFORNIA CAME LATE TO THE GAME COMPARED TO OTHER STATES WITH CENTRALIZED WITH A CENTRALIZED VOTER DATABASE WE ARE BIG STATE. AND PROBABLY NEEDED THAT TIME- I BELIEVE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TEN AND FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER THE INITIAL STATES- INCORPORATED AND COMPLIED WITH THAT- MANDATE WITH ALL THAT TIME THE WRINKLES WERE CLEARLY NOT IRONED OUT BEFORE LAUNCH. THIS ALONG WITH THE MOTOR VOTER OR WITH- VOTER THAN ASSN SAME DAY REGISTRATION AND SOON VOTE CENTERS MATE WILL MAKE FOR TSUNAMI OF PROBLEMS AND ALREADY HAVE THAT SEEM TO CONSTANTLY COME TO LIGHT THERE IS ENORMOUS PRESSURE ON COUNTY REGISTRARS TO KEEP UP. AND THIS MAKES FOR PROCESS THAT FOR NOW SEEMS TO BE DEPENDENT ON THE HONOR SYSTEM. THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE FOUND THAT I FE. STARTED A VERY FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL WHY ARE THERE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OVER THE AGE OF A HUNDRED AND SIX WHICH AT LAST LOOK WAS THE OLDEST AGE OF. OF RESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA ON THE VOTER ROLES IS IT DEAD PEOPLE VOTING OR MERELY THE QUALITY. OF THE DATA MAINTENANCE WE FOUND THAT IT WAS THE LATTER. WIRE LAWSUITS LIKE THE ONE THAT WAS RECENTLY WON BY JUDICIAL WATCH IN LOS AGELES COUNTY- WHY DID THEY HAPPEN WHERE THEY FIND TWENTY FIRST WHEN THEY END UP HAVING TO REMOVE TWENTY PERCENT. OF THOSE REGISTERED THAT THERE WERE A HUNDRED AND REGISTERED. TO VOTE. SO WILL TAKE YEARS AND MILLIONS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO ASSESS AND THEN FIX THIS PROBLEM. THERE MUST BE FILTERS SUCH AS THOSE ADDRESSED IN SB FIFTY SEVEN. IN MY VIEW SB FOUTS FIFTY SEVEN SO IT'S FOR SAFEGUARDS ALMOST AN AUTOMATED FILTERING AN AUDIT MECHANISM WHICH IS SO VERY CRITICAL TO ANY FORM OF INTEGRITY IN ALL FORMS OF DATA GATHERING. IT MOST CERTAINLY WILL SLOW DOWN INTERNAL QUALITY DETERIORATION. WE NEED MORE OF THESE TYPES OF STOP GAPS WITH LEGISLATION LIKE THIS WE CAN PREVENT PROBLEMS INSTEAD OF WAITING TO FIND THEM IN AN AUDIT. MOST IMPORTANTLY THESE FILTERS PROTECT NOT JUST THE INTEGRITY OF THE ROLES BUT CLEARLY DEFINES THE INTENT OF THE VOTER. IT'S AN INTEGRITY TRY FACTOR THAT PROTECTS THE VOTERS ASSIST THE STATE. AND ALLEVIATES UNDUE STRESS ON THE COUNTIES WE HOPE THAT SB FIFTY SEVEN IS THE BEGINNING. IN NEW LEGISLATION TO RESTORE INTEGRITY TO THE VOTER ROLLS IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE. OPPOSITION JAMES TWELVE ON BEHALF OF SECRETARY STATE ALEX PADILLA. AS THE COMMITTEE NOW SAYS AND THE AUTHOR'S NOTE THE MOTOR VOTER ROLL OUT EXPERIENCED SEVERAL ISSUES- BUT THESE ISSUES HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED. OUR OFFICE HAS WORK COLLABORATIVELY. WHAT THE NAME BE TO IMPLEMENT THESE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE INDEPENDENT AUDIT OF MOTOR VOTER CONDUCTED BY ERNST AND YOUNG LAST YEAR. WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT AUTOMATIC VOTER REGISTRATION AT THE DMV IS A POWERFUL TOOL TO STRENGTHEN OUR DEMOCRACY. SINCE THE LAUNCH THE MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM NEARLY SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS HAVE BEEN REGISTER TO VOTE. INCLUDING ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION NEW RESTAURANTS. THANKS TO THE MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM AS WE ENTER TWENTY TWENTY. WE HAVE A RECORD TWENTY MILLION PLUS REGISTER VOTERS. OVER 80% OF OUR ELIGIBLE VOTERS ARE REGISTERED TO VOTE THE HIGHEST RATE SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY TWO. CALIFORNIA MOTOR VOTER HAS BEEN A TRIMS TRANSFORM SUCCESS FOR DEMOCRACY. SB SEVEN FIFTY SEVEN WOULD UNDERMINE THAT SUCCESS WHICH IS WHY SECRETARY PERIOD STRONGLY OPPOSES SB FIFTY SEVEN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS BERNICE DOWNSIDE FOR ANIMAL VOTING RIGHTS ATTORNEY WITH THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA IS HELIO AND LEAVE WOMEN VOTERS ARE PART OF A GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS THAT SPENT A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME WORKING WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND THE DMV LEADING TO THE ROLL UP WITH A NEW ROLL OUT OF THE NEW MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM. OUR WORK WAS AIMED AT ENSURING THAT THE PROGRAM'S LANGUAGE RELATED TO VOTER ELIGIBILITY AND THE VOTER REGISTRATION PROCESS WAS AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE. LANGUAGE TESTING INCLUDED FOCUS GROUPS LED BY DESIGN EXPERTS TESTING WAS DONE AND MULTIPLE LANGUAGE LANGUAGES AND TRANSLATIONS WERE REVIEWED BY COMMUNITY MEMBERS. AS A RESULT THE CURRENT NEW MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM HAS BEEN THOUGHTFULLY DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE IN ELIGE INELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS ARE BEING PLACED ON VOTER ROLLS. CURRENTLY WITH VOTERS REACH THE VOTER REGISTRATION PORTION OF A DRIVER'S LICENSE OR ID CARD APPLICATION THE VERY FIRST QUESTION THERE ASKED IS WHETHER THERE SAID AS- IF THE ANSWER NO OR DECLINE TO ANSWER THEY'RE NOT PRESENTED WITH ANY FURTHER VOTER REGISTRATION QUESTIONS. EVEN AFTER A MOTOR CONFIRMS OF THEIR US DESCENT THEY MUST AND AFFIRM UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY THAT THEY MEET ALL VOTER REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS AGAIN IF ENTER NO CLIENT STATE THEY'RE NOT PRESENTED WITH ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. WELL THE NEW MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM DID EXPERIENCE TECHNICAL ISSUES DURING ITS INITIAL ROLLOUT THE DMV IN THE SECRETARY OF STATE HAVE NOW INVESTED SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO RESOLVE THOSE ISSUES AND SHARP THE FUNCTIONS OF THE NEW MOTOR VOTER SYSTEM THAT PREVENT REGISTRATION OF INELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS. THE NOTION THE ATTIC VOTER REGISTRATION AT THE DMV AND ROADS THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTIONS IS SIMPLY UNFOUNDED. THE REALITY IS THAT THIS PROGRAM HAS ALREADY MADE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS AND CLOSING VOTER REGISTRATION GAPS. AND MAKING OUR ELECTORATE MORE REPRESENTATIVE FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR NOVA. THANK YOU- I NEGLECTED TO CALL FOR THOSE OTHERS OTHERS IN SUPPORT. OF ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. OKAY OPPOSITION ANEEL ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION IF YOU APPROACH A MICROPHONE THIS MONEY IS CITY WHEREVER OF THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE CHAIR PACIFICA PARTY CALIFORNIA- AS A PARTY THAT SUFFERED FROM SOME THE- REPRESSIVE LAWS THAT WE DO HAVE IN CALIFORNIA.

THANK YOU- IN BEFORE WE TURN MEMBERS JUST ONE TECHNICAL QUESTION IT WHEN YOU GO TO THE DMV AND IF YOU DON'T ANSWER THE QUESTION WHICH BEST DESCRIBES IF YOU DON'T CHECK ON THE BLOCKS CAN YOU NOT PROCEED TO THE REMAINDER THE APPLICATIONS THAT REQUIRE TO ANSWER. EACH QUESTION ON EACH ONE OF THEM ANSWER OKAY ALL RIGHT LET ME TURN TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS QUESTIONS. OF THE CENTER NIELSEN AND. WHAT COULD YOU TELL US THAT THE SECTOR STATE IS DOING TO ADDRESS THE- VOTER ROLLS VERIFY THEM TO. OUR ARE YOU DO YOU HOW DO YOU CHECK. AND WHAT AMOUNT OF TIME DOES IT TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE SAME DAY VOTING REGISTRATION HOW HOW DO YOU PROCESS THAN THAT. PARTICULAR VOTER TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE IN FACT ELIGIBLE TO VOTE AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO CLEAN UP THE ROLES. AND ELECTION OFFICIALS WOULD BE PROCESSING THE SAME DAY VOTER ENTRANCE. AND WOULD BE PROCESS AT THE END OF THE CAMPUS AFTER POINT PLACE BALLOTS AND OPEN ABOUT SEVEN PROCESS AND- OFFICE LIKE ANY OTHER VOTER REGISTRATION YOU'D FIND SEE IF THERE'S A MATCH- THERE'S A MATCH YOU'D MATCH THAT RECORDS THE REGISTRATION. THERE'S NOT A MATCH. I WOULD BE A NEW VOTER ON THE RULES. IS THAT BEING DONE. US IN REGISTRATION WAS WROTE ON TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND THAT'S MY UNDERSTAND IS HOW IT'S BEEN ROLLED ON THE COUNTIES. BUT I UNDERSTAND- SOME CHALLENGES IN IN COUNTY INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES. THAT THEY ARE NOT COMPLYING IS THAT CORRECT SOME EVEN ARE UNDER COURT ORDER. NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE NO NOT YOUR KNOWLEDGE WHAT WHAT IS A SECTOR STATE DOING TO VERIFY AND MAKE SURE THESE ROLES ARE. AS UP TO DATE. OKAY ENGLISH OFFICIALS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MAINTENANCE AND UPKEEP OF- THE VOTER ROLLS KNOWN AS WITH MAINTENANCE ARE WE PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THE COUNTIES- FROM STATEWIDE AGENCIES SUCH THE DMV SO SKIRMISH CREATION- PART OF CORRECTIONS. TO SEND TO THE COUNTIES AND THE USER INFORMATION UPDATE THEIR LISTS WHETHER TO UPDATE ADDRESSES- WHETHER TO CANCEL REGISTRATIONS WHETHER TO MOVE THEM TO AN ACTIVE. ANOTHER GROUP WAS APPARENT LAWSUITS IN THE- NOTICED THAT THERE ARE NINETEEN COUNTIES. THE ELEVEN OF NINETEEN COUNTIES THAT HAVE BEEN FOUND NATIONWIDE ARE CALIFORNIA COUNTIES THAT ARE PROBLEMATIC. HOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT. I WOULD COMMON LITIGATION BUT IN TERMS OF WHAT I'VE SEEN ON MEDIA REPORTS- THEY OFTEN FLAYED THE INACTIVE VOTER FILE WITH THE ACTIVE VOTER FILE AND ENACTED A FIRE OR ARE VOTERS WHO YOU ARE NOT ON THE VOTER ROLLS THEY DON'T RECEIVE THE- OF INFORMATION GUIDE DON'T GET ABOUT MAIL TO THEM. AND WHEN YOU ADD IN THE NOT DEVOTED TO THE ACTIVATOR FOUNDING THAT'S WHERE THOSE ACCUSATIONS COME FROM- BUT ENACTED VOTER FILE IS SOMETHING WHERE VOTERS ARE FOUND TO POSSIBLY BE HAVE MOVED TOWARD TO BEEN DECEASED OR OTHERWISE AN ELIGIBLE BUT THEY CAN'T FOR THE MATCH THE RECORD- THEY PUT ON THE INACTIVE FILE FOR CERTAIN TIME- THAT'S MY- ANY WHAT THOSE ACCUSATIONS. STEM FROM. WELL YOU KNOW WE GET THE SAME ROUTE. CALLS IN OUR OFFICES THAT HAVE BEEN CITED HERE BY THE AUTHORS. AND WITH MANY PRESS STORIES OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS SINCE MOTOR VOTER A PROBLEMS. ARE YOU DENYING THAT THERE ARE PROBLEMS. NO THE SAID MY TESTIMONY- WE CAN DOLLARS AT THE WERE ISSUES WITH THE ROLLOUT- WITH MOTOR VOTER- THOSE ISSUES HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED- WE'RE WORKING TO IMPLEMENT THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE ERNST AND YOUNG REPORT FROM LAST YEAR- AND WE ALSO ENCOURAGE- MEMBERS AND THE MEDIA IF YOU HAVE- CONSTITUENTS OR FOLKS CONCERNED ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE REGISTRATION TO REACH OUT TO OUR OFFICE. REACH OUT THE COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICIALS OFFICE AND WE CAN GET TO THE BOTTOM OF. AN ISSUE THEY MAY BE EXPERIENCING. WHAT ABOUT THE TRUST IN THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES. WERE IN TRUSTING TO ONE OF THE MOST TROUBLED AGENCIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THIS SACRED RESPONSIBILITY. AND THEY CLEARLY HAVE NOT BEEN UP TO THE TASK. ISN'T THAT A CONCERN. IN TERMS OF THE MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM- LIKE I SAID WE WERE FRUSTRATED BY THE ROLL OUT ISSUES- MOTOR VOTER BUT AS OF TODAY THE MOTOR VOTER PROGRAMS WORKING AS INTENDED AND SUCCESSFUL. WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE. IN THE ORIGINAL STATUTE. TO PREVENT SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT OCCURRED IN THE ROLLOUT ANYTHING. I CAN THINK OF SOMETHING IN THE STATUTE NO. SO WHAT IS IT JUST INCOMPETENCE OF. COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICES IN THE SECTOR STATES OFFICES HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS I WOULD THINK THE- FOR LOOKING BACK ON HIS MEN DIFFERENTLY IT WAS THE LAUNCH OF MULTIPLE THINGS- IN APRIL TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT WAS THE BRAND NEW- ELECTRONIC DRIVER'S LICENSE FORM ONLINE- OPTIONS AT THE DMV. AS WELL AS MOTOR VOTER. I THINK THAT'S WHERE THOSE ISSUES CAME FROM THE LAUNCH OKAY. WELL YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THERE'S A CLOUD OF AND- ABOUT INTEGRITY AT OVER THE WHOLE PROCESS YET AND TODAY. HENCE THE BILL ENHANCE CONCERNED ENHANCE LAWSUIT SO I'M NOT COMFORTED THAT WE SOLVE ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS YET. THANK YOU AS THEIR NIELSEN THANK US SENATOR HERTZBERG QUESTIONS YES SIR THANK YOU VENTURA. ON. YOU KNOW THIS IS BEEN AN ISSUE WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH FOR A LONG TIME THE BROADER ISSUE OF JUST MAKING SURE THAT EVERYBODY IN SOCIETY WHO HAS THE ABILITY TO VOTE IN THE ELIGIBILITY OF ALL VOTES MAKE MOST IMPORTANT THING IT UNDERMINES THE FRAMEWORK OF OUR DEMOCRACY WE ALL TALK ABOUT THIS GREAT DEMOCRACY IN THE FOR AND WE HAVE- THE PARTICIPATION LEVELS AT A IT AREAS SPECIAL DISTRICT IN THE COMMUNITIES ARE PRESENT CORPORATION THE- UNDER THE LAW UNLESS YOU- HAVE A CERTAIN- MINIMUM NUMBER OF PARTICIPATION YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE A QUORUM NECESSARY TO CONDUCT BUSINESS. AND SO WE'VE BEEN TRYING FOR MANY YEARS WHETHER IT'S THE SAME DAY OR WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS OF THE DAVIS ADMINISTRATION DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO ENHANCE OF DISSIPATION MOTOR VOTER HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT THE NATIONAL LEVEL CERTAIN TALKED ABOUT FOR A LONG TIME AND TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE IS PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY IN TERMS OF THE STATE'S NUMBERS- BUT I SEE A DISCONNECT BETWEEN WHAT SENATOR BATES TALKS ABOUT HERE IN WHAT THE- LARGER ARGUMENT IS AGAINST THIS NOTION ABOUT. XIN AIR THE GOAL PARTY MISSTEPS TRUST IN THE DMV WHEN IN FACT WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US SO I JUST ACTUALLY DO THIS ONLINE THE OTHER DAY AND TRY TO GET MY- THE LADY. AT TO THIS DAY I THINK OVER THE WEEKEND. FATHER AND SO THE QUESTION THAT YOU RAISED PAGE TWO IS THE ISSUE OF WHAT BEST DESCRIBES YOU AND WHAT WHAT I GOT FROM YOU SENATOR BATES WASN'T THAT YOU WANT AN OPT OUT YOU JUST WANT CLARIFICATION SO THIS SOMEBODY BECAUSE I ACTUALLY IS IN QUESTION IF SOMEBODY'S ALREADY REGISTERED I'M A MOTIVATIONAL ANY FURTHER CHANGES THAT'S AN OPT OUT THAT SAYS I'M REGISTERED AND SO WHAT WHAT I'M WHAT I BUT I'M HAVING YET SOME CHALLENGE OVER THE ANALYSIS AND SOME CHALLENGE HERE ABOUT WHAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO DO THIS HAS BEEN A LARGER DISCUSSION OVER MANY YEARS AS TO WHETHER THERE'S FRAUD AND ALL THOSE ISSUES AND WE CAN CITE BUT THOSE THINGS ALL DAY LONG. BUT WHAT I GATHER FROM YOU IS THAT WE NEED A FOURTH BOX AS THE CHAIRMAN SAID THE JUST SIMPLY SAYS I'M ALREADY REGISTERED THANK YOU VERY MUCH RIGHT RATHER THAN- I WANT TO REGISTER I DON'T I MIGHT WANT TO REGISTER I'VE ALREADY DONE THAT I WANT TO REGISTER TO VOTE UP THE VOTER REGISTRATION LIKE CHECK THAT BOX IS A ONE. MAKE SURE OF WAS ACCURATE THAT'S WHAT I DID. HERTZBERG I WHY I SAID I I'M UP THE I'M A REGISTERED VOTER AND I'M UPDATING IT JUST TO CHECK IT YEAH AND THAT'S ALL THE MAKE SHE WAS ACCURATE BECAUSE I SAYS I DIDN'T DON'T WANT TO REGISTER I DIDN'T CHECK THIRD BOX THAT'S WHAT I DID BUT SO I'M TRYING TO GET TO WHAT YOU PURPOSES HERE IT'S ONE THING TO CLARIFY THAT I'M ALREADY REGISTERED BECAUSE THE IDEA HERE THE OPT OUT WOULD HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT ON PEOPLE REGISTERING AND THERE'S A GREAT SENSITIVITY. IT IN THE PROPER THE DEVOTEE THAT WE DO ENGAGE IN YEARS THE OLD DAYS WHEN IT WAS THIRTY DAY REGISTRATION PEOPLE MIGHT OF MOVED IN THEIR APARTMENT FOR GOT TO REGISTER THAT ALSO THE ELECTION STARTS COMING UP TO THREE WEEKS ANOTHER ARE WE'VE GOT THING POSSIBLE SAME DAY IN ALL OF THESE THINGS TO ENHANCE THE PARTICIPATION OF THE ANYBODY'S AGAINST THAT WHAT I WANT IS CLARITY HERE IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU'RE REALLY SEEKING I'M NOT SO SURE THE MESSAGE IS DIFFERENT RIGHT. THE FATHER IS THE US VERSUS. ADDITIONAL BAR THE US. TRUMP THAT WE DO HERE. THANK YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG TO THE TERRIFIED. BONTA THAT I'M I'VE GONE KIND OF FULL CIRCLE ON IT CENTER HERTZBERG BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT THE FIRST THING THE SCREENSHOT SAYS TO YOU UNDER STATE LAW ELIGIBLE- CITIZENS WILL BE REGISTERED TO VOTE AND LEFT THE CHOOSE NOT TO IN THE IN THE SECTION. OUT WHICH BEST DESCRIBES YOU SO THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO OPT OUT BUT AS I LOOKED AT IT I THOUGHT FIRST OF ALL THE CONCERN WAS DO I REALLY WANT THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES TRANSPOSON MY INFORMATION TO SECRETARY STATE ESPECIALLY IF I'M ALREADY REGISTERED SO THAT WAS THE GENESIS OF LET'S HAPPEN OFTEN BECAUSE THAT MEANS YOU.ARE FREE OF AND IF YOU WANT TO BE REGISTERED- TO ARE YOU MENTALLY I HAVE BEEN A IN PPO WANT TO BECOME A DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN A VERSA BUT WHEN I LOOKED AT IT AND KEPT LOOKING AT IT REALIZE THANKS AND FOR THE A PHYSICALLY TO PAGE TWO IT'S CERTAINLY A SIMPLE FIX TO PUT A BOX IN THAT REALLY DESCRIBES YOU. THAT YOU EITHER CAN YOU DO NOT WANT TO REGISTER- SO YOU THAT OUR WINDOW YOU MIGHT BE EN EL THE PERSON WE PEOPLE NOT REGISTERED ARE I HAD ONE AMEND ACTUALLY CAME TO OFFICE SHE DOES NOT WANT VOTE SHE DOUBLED. SHE DOES TO VOTE AND APPARENTLY CHECK THAT BOX STILL GOT RED. SO HOW DO YOU FIX THAT WILL BE IT'S CONFUSING BUT IF YOU HAVE A BOX FOR THOSE WHO'VE BEEN REGISTERED IN. ITALY ARE AND HOW THE REGISTRATION CHANGED IT'S A GREAT IF YOU HAVE ONE MORE BOX WHAT THAT'S WHERE I EVOLVED TO THAT. LET'S JUST PUT ANOTHER BOX IN THERE AND THAT WAY WE CAN AT LEAST MAKE THE SYSTEM START TO WORK THE WAY IT WAS ORIGINALLY INTENDED. DON'T WANT TO VOTE YOU GOT A BOX FOR THAT. THE ONE TO BE REGISTERED I MEAN AND I'M ALREADY REGISTERED PUT A BOX AND FOR THAT AND PLEASE DON'T. EDIT OR CHANGE OUR HOW WE STOP INFORMATION FROM THE DIEM BEING GOING TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE THAT IS REALLY A FOUR ISSUE. ARE THAT'S A PRIVACY ISSUE PROBABLY ANOTHER FULL THING BECAUSE THE BILL ACTUALLY THE A. B. FIFTEEN THIRTY WONDER REMEMBER THE NUMBER RIGHT ACTUALLY REQUIRED. EVERYBODY TO BE REGISTERED OUGHT UNLESS THEY AFFIRMATIVELY SAID DO NOT REGISTER AND I THINK THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT FORCING PEOPLE TO BE JUST. ANOTHER ISSUE BUT THAT'S WHAT STARTED WITH. THE OP. RIGHT NOW WE'RE GONNA FIFTY ASK FOR THE PRIME RATE. OUR I WILL TAKE AN AMENDMENT TO THIS BILL THAT ADDS A FOURTH BULLET ON THE SCREEN SHOT I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S- VERY DIFFICULT VERY EXPENSIVE. I'M NOT COMPUTER WIZARD BUT WITH SEEM TO BE A- PART OF OUR OWN. DOCUMENT HE QUIT WE ARE NOT A GOOD FOR THE- INSURANCE USUALLY. IS BECAUSE I SEE KIND OF FINISHES IF YOU'RE SAYING I DON'T TRUST THE D. M. V. WITH THIS. MISSION THE TRUCK. THAT'S A DIFFERENT. A WITH HAVING THE DMV ENGAGE IN THE PROCESS IS AND WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A LONG TIME OKAY WITH THAT. I DON'T THINK THE RISK IS REALLY THAT BIG. IN TERMS IN TERMS OF THAT THAT NOTION SO. GOOD I'M TRYING TO. GET A FINE TO THE TUNE OF WHAT I WANNA SAY HERE'S ONE THING TO SAY OKAY- I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH WITH FROM A PUBLIC POLICY PERSPECTIVE. THAT WE BASICALLY YOU KNOW SOME COUNTRIES REQUIRE YOU TO REGISTER OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW SOME COUNTRIES REQUIRE YOU TO VOTE WHEN I WAS TELLING PEOPLE TO VOTE. E'RE SAYING IF YOU'RE ELIGIBLE YOU YOU YOU AND YOU GOT A DRIVER'S LICENSE. YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ENHANCE THAN MOST POPULATION TO GET REGISTERED WITH A GOOD THING IN MY JUDGMENT. GET THE MOST NUMBER OF PEOPLE REGISTERED AS WHATEVER TOOLS WE CAN DO. TO DO THAT IS IMPORTANT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AS THEIR LEYVA. CARE GOOD MORNING OUR I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT WE HAVE A VERY ACTIVE DISTRICT OFFICE AND HERE AT THE SACRAMENTO OFFICE WE GET TONS OF PHONE CALLS WE RECEIVED ABSOLUTELY NO PHONE CALLS ABOUT THE MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM SO I JUST WANTED TO. COUNTER THAT NOT ALL OFFICES WERE RECEIVING THOSE CALLS I'M IN A I JUST ALSO WANT TO SAY I DON'T THINK IT WAS INCOMPETENCE OF SENATOR NIELSEN I THINK THAT ANY TIME IN ANY ASPECT OF LIFE WHEN YOU ROLL OUT A NEW PROGRAM THEY'RE GOING TO BE BUGS- NO ONE INTENTIONALLY SETS OUT TO MAKE MISTAKES NO ONE INTENSELY SETS OUT TO DO A BAD JOB- AND I THINK THAT- THE SECRETARY OF STATE HAS FIX THOSE ISSUES- AND I JUST THINK THAT WE HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE. IN MY OLD LIFE BEFORE WAS ELECTED ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS WE DID WAS TRYING TO REGISTER PEOPLE TO VOTE AND PEOPLE YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE BUSY LIFE THEY JUST DON'T THEY DON'T THINK ABOUT IT AND SO ANYTHING THAT WE- DO TO. KEEP EASY FOR PEOPLE TO. I IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING SO I APPRECIATE THAT. PUT HER OFF. AS HIS FIX THE BUGS ARE ME. BUGS BECAUSE IT IS A BIG PROGRAM AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE DMV. WE CAN LOOK BACK AT PAST ISSUES IN THE DMV BUT WE HAVE A GOVERNOR WHO IS TRYING TO RECTIFY THOSE ISSUES. AND TRYING TO MAKE DMV BETTER AND I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK TO THE FUTURE. AND HELP IN THAT REGARD BECAUSE DMV IS A HUGE AREA A REFUGE A HUGE. INSTITUTION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE JUST WANT THEM TO DO WELL BECAUSE IT BENEFITS EVERYONE SO UNFORTUNATELY I WILL HAVE TO OPPOSE THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU SIR LIMóN UP THERE. WALK. VERY OFTEN. GUARDING YOUR- ASSESSMENT OF THE DMV NEW VOTER APPLICATION. AND IN THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MADE A SUGGESTION. IS THAT. IT ENHANCE EXISTING SOLUTION WITH REAL TIME ALIDATION OF VOTER ELIGIBILITY USING DEFINITE DEFINITIVE DATA. SOURCES NOW HAS THAT BEEN DONE BY THE SECTOR STATE THIS IS DIRECTLY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF SEVERAL THERE I THINK YOU WERE THAT AROUND NINE OR OUR OFFICE FOR THE DMV. YEAH YEAH. IT SAYS. IT PRINT ENHANCE THE EXISTING SOLUTION WITH REAL TIME VALIDATION NOW THAT COULD BE MAYBE THE COUNTY REGISTRARS AS WELL I WOULD ASSUME. BUT THE POINTING OUT A DEFICIENCY. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOT FAMILIAR THAT ONE BLOCKING ABOUT YOUR OFFICE ON WOULD YOU PLEASE BECAUSE THAT'S THE KIND OF A FUNDAMENTAL POINT HERE THAT EVEN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS ACKNOWLEDGED VERY RECENT. JUST A FEW QUESTIONS SEVENTY THREE FINISHED THEM A JUST FEW QUESTIONS FIRST THE QUESTION MISTER WHAT. YOU KNOW ABOUT WHETHER YOU LOVE OR- DON'T LOVE THE DMV WE HAVE NO CHOICE DO WE DOESN'T FEDERAL LAW MANDATES THAT WE OPERATE MOTOR VOTER THROUGH THE DMV. THAT CRACKED THE NATIONAL VOTER SUPPRESSION ACT OF NINETY THREE REQUIRES THAT THAT CAN BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REGISTER TO VOTE. IT IS OUTSIDE OUR JURISDICTION OUTSIDE OUR AUTHORITY TO ACTUALLY DECIDE ANOTHER STATE AGENCY OR EVEN A LOCAL AGENCY HAS RESPONSIBILITY. FOR IMPLEMENTING- THE FEDERAL LEGISLATION CONCERNING MOTOR VOTERS ARE RIGHT CORRECT ALL RIGHT. ANOTHER QUESTION- MISS DONES WERE TESTIFIED THAT 20% OF THE OF. VOTERS ON THE LA REGISTER VOTERS ROLES WERE ELIMINATED WAS AT IT A CONSEQUENCE OF THEM BEING INELIGIBLE TO VOTE OR WHAT. WAS THAT'S JUST SIMPLY FOLKS IN VOTING SOMETIME. THIS MICROPHONE I'M SORRY EVERY FIND. ON IT THEY FOUND THAT THE FIRST OF ALL WAS A HUNDRED AND WERE REGISTERED AND SO THEY WANTED TO GET TO THE CORE OF HOW YOU COULD HAVE MORE. WILL REGISTER VAN WERE RESIDENTS- BY ABOUT 44% OVER WHAT IT SHOULD BE PROBABLY MORE. SO WHAT THEY WHAT IT WAS WAS EXPIRED REGISTRANTS OUR OR INACTIVE- REGISTRANTS PEOPLE WHO HAD- UNDER MANDATE IF YOU HAVE. NOT VOTED IN TWO CONSECUTIVE FEDERAL ELECTIONS. YOU SHOULD BE SENATE CONFIRMATION CARD AND THEY HAVE NOT SENT OUT CONFIRMATION CARDS IN OVER TWENTY YEARS. SO BASICALLY THAT'S WHAT THE FINDING WAS A NOT LAWSUIT AND IT WAS SETTLED THEY JUDICIAL WATCH ONE NOT LAWSUIT SO WASN'T. FICTITIOUS OR YOU KNOW PEOPLE SAYING THINGS AND THEY'VE BEEN A FANTASTICAL WAY IT WAS. VALID I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THE RECORD SO IT WAS IT WAS NOT 20% OR WHATEVER AND FIGURE I WAS NOT IN. POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE ONE POINT SIX MINUTES. FORTY OFF THE ROLLS BECAUSE OF THAT I AND I BELIEVE THERE JUST OVER FIVE MILLION REGISTRANTS AN ALLEY. OKAY I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THE IT WASN'T NECESSARILY THEIR INELIGIBLE TO VOTE IT WAS THAT THEY HAD NOT VOTED IN IN A COUPLE DIFFERENT LECTURE MAKING THEM AN ELIGIBLE TO BE ON THE VOTER ROLLS. THE FIVE BY MANDATE OKAY I DON'T WANNA BELIEVER THAT THANK ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU- WHAT WITH RESPECT TO SENATOR BATES A SUGGESTION THAT SIMPLY ANOTHER BLOCK BE ADDED PRIOR TO THE PRIMARY IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE DMV- WE WENT THROUGH THIS WITH THE- ISSUE BECAUSE THE AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY- THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE AT THIS POINT FOR THE DMV TO. REPAIR THEIR THEIR SYSTEM PRIOR TO THE PRIMARY THE GENERAL IS THAT RIGHT. SHOP I CAN'T SPEAK THE DMV BUT THAT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING FOR THE A. I. P. LEGISLATION. RIGHT IT IN ANOTHER QUESTION. AND THAT THAT WAS UP. REYES BY HER BATES UP WHETHER IT'S NOW OR NEXT YEAR ADDING ANOTHER BLOCK IT SAYS I'M ALREADY REGISTERED TO VOTE AND DO NOT WISH TO CHANGE MY REGISTRATION WHICH IS I DON'T I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT'S THE BILL BUT BUT- I PATHETICALLY. IF WE ADD ANOTHER BLOCK WHAT WHAT WOULD THAT DO WITH THE MEAN AND I'M NOT SOME OF THE LOGISTICS OF IT I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU SAID YOU'D FOCUS GROUPS AND THAT KIND OF THING WHAT WHAT WOULD THAT DO TO VOTER BEHAVIOR. OR A REGISTERED BEHAVIOR. I WOULD THINK I NEED TO BE TESTED RIGHT ON BEFORE. THE LAUNCH MOTOR VOTER THAN LANGUAGE ON THE SCREENS WAS TESTED- FIELD TESTED BY ORGANIZATIONS AND PRESENTED- LEGISLATURE INTO DEPRAVITY GROUPS ON IT WHICH- TOOK FEEDBACK AS CHANGE I THINK WE'D- STILL BE OPEN TO MORE CHANGES TO MAKE IT AND IMPROVE IT. IS A JUST. A AGAIN I AM SO WHAT'S THE BIG TO THE FACT IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT IF YOU'RE ALREADY REGISTERED. AND YOU WANT TO MAINTAIN YOUR REGISTRATION THAT THAT THAT EASILY DECIPHERED HERE I GET THE I DO NOT WANT TO REGISTER TO VOTE BUT IF YOU DON'T GET PASSED. WORDS AS FOR UPDATE MY VOTER REGISTRATION AT THAT. I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BILL FOCUS UPON. ALL RIGHT OTHER QUESTIONS THE OTHER QUESTIONS ALL RIGHT CENTER BATES THAT ARE MORE LIKE YOU MAY CLOSE WELL I THANK YOU FOR WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE A VERY GOOD DEBATE AS WE TAKE A LOOK AT A DEEPER DIVE INTO WHAT IS CREATING THE WHIMS OF SPECIFICALLY WITH THE MOTOR VOTER LAW I WANT TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR IN RESPONSE TO SENATOR HERTZBERG I DO NOT HAVE AN ISSUE WITH TRUST WITH THE DMV I HAVE BEEN HAVING BEEN A DRIVER SINCE I WAS. EIGHTEEN OLD THEY'VE TREATED ME WELL GOT ONE TICKET NAY DIDN'T MESS UP MY DRIVER'S LICENSE BACK I THINK THERE IS ANY TO I IN THIS STATE NOW WE KNOW THERE'S AN INITIATIVE HAD BALLOT OF PRIVATE HE IS A PRIVACY ISSUE WITH THIS WHICH IS NOT REALLY PART. OF WHAT THE LEGISLATION CIVIC THEONE. BUT I THINK ARE REQUIRING EVERY DE. SER TO VOTE TRENT BID FROM THE DMB WHO'S DOING WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE THE VERY BEST JOB THEY POSSIBLY CAN WITH A SHORT TIME LINE THAT WAS MANDATED UPON THEM AND WE'VE HEARD. ANONYMOUSLY FROM A NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THAT. DEPARTMENT THAT AGENCY THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT THEY WERE NOT IN FAVOR OF THE LAUNCH TIME. WE HAVE AN ISSUE- AND WE NEED TO ADDRESS IT AND I THINK MY BILLS SPECIFICALLY WAS LOOKING FOR THAT ANSWER AND I CAME UP WITH A SIMPLER ONE SO I. WOULD BE VERY OF. THE OF THE OF. THIS HEARING WE TAKE THAT FORWARD YEAH I CAN'T IMAGINE I CAN SEE THE INDEPENDENT. AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY BECAUSE THAT'S A PARTY PREFERENCE. BUT JUST TO BE ABLE TO SAY FOR THE BILL'S GOING FORWARD BETWEEN THE PRIMARY I'M ALREADY REGISTERED DON'T. **** BECAUSE I WANT BE ABLE TO VOTE IN THAT ELECTION AND IT WILL. BE IF ALL. THEIR BELIEVE THAT EVERY BODY. WHO WILL. FEEL COME ALLUSION VOTE. PART OF. BLOCK THE FREEDOM THAT WE ARE. ACTUALLY ARE ENJOY IN THIS GREAT NATION SOLD FOR ANYBODY TO BE BLOCKED FROM THAT BECAUSE OF THESE. WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE CUTE COMPUTER GLITCHES OR COMPUTER ERRORS ARE PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS THAT NEEDS TO BE DEALT DEALT WITH IMMEDIATELY. BEFORE THAT PRIMARY AND THIS IS ONE SIMPLE SOLUTION ARE BY ADDING A BOX- TO THE S. THAT DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING ANY OF THE OTHER QUESTIONS DOESN'T CHANGE THEM IN THE SLIGHTEST. WOULD BE A GREAT BENEFIT OUGHT TO VOTER ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITY. TO BE PART OF THIS GREAT NATION AND THAT THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND- PICKING AND CHOOSING YOU WANT. TO COME UP TO THE HOUSE BILL HOW OLD THE- GOVERNMENT IN AN ACT OF EXPRESS THE WISHES OF THE PEOPLE. SO PLEASE CONSIDER THAT OUT ON THOSE- POSITION THAT DO THAT ARE YOU WILL BE I THINK UPGRADE. NOT TOO. OLD FOR YOU BEING A LEAD ON HOW WE ACTUALLY HAVE OUR GOVERNMENT AGENCIES REGISTERING PEOPLE. I WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE IN A VERY EFFICIENT BUT VERY FAIR AND TRANSPARENT MANNER. EXAMINE SOMEWHAT. MYSTERY DATE AT THE BILL YET THAT IS. OF THIS BILL. ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS COMMITTEE MEETINGS AS WE DON'T HAVE SCREENS WE DON'T HAVE- THE ABILITY TO.BRING UP WEBSITE. AB GO WAS APPLE. OPPORTUNITY BY GOING TO THE DMV AND DOING A TRANSACTION SO I'M I'M I'M VERY GLAD THAT SENATOR. BYRD IT THIS WEEKEND IT'S FRESH IN YOUR. MIND BUT WHEN YOU THROUGH THE PROCESS THIS IS. THE OLD BIRD AND SO WE WERE HAVE DONE YEARS IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY HERE SEE THE BOXES AND SEE WHAT WE'RE WE'RE DEALING WITH SO I WANT TO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR. BRINGING THAT UP. IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET EVERYONE TO REGISTER TO VOTE AT THAT THAT'S NOT THE ARGUMENT- WITH WITH THIS BILL- BUT- BUT- THE GOAL IS CONVENIENCE. THE GOAL IS USER FRIENDLY THE GOAL IS. A TRYING TO BE DIGITALLY INNOVATIVE AND RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT IT'S A LACKING- USE THE ABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND AND NOT GET FRUSTRATED OR CONFUSED. AND SO THAT'SWHAT WHAT WERE CLOSING AND SO I APPRECIATE. THE COMMENTS CENTER HERTZBERG- I THINK IF THIS BILL NEEDS ANYTHING BASED ON YOUR- ARGUMENTS MAYBE SOME. AMENDMENTS TO CLARIFY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH I THINK THIS BILL SHOULD MOVE FORWARD WE SHOULD BE. ASSISTING OUR CONSTITUENTS IN A POSITIVE WAY TO MAKE VOTING AND VOTER REGISTRATIONS MUCH MORE CONVENIENT AND THAT'S WHY I REQUEST AN AYE VOTE ON SB FIFTY SEVEN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COLLEAGUES. THANK THANK YOU SIR MORE LUGGAGE OF QUESTIONS THAT ARE PURCHASED APOLOGIZE OUT OF ORDER HERE THE FIRST POINT OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE IF I COULD.

AND FOCUS GROUP IN A LIGHT AND SEEMS TO ME THE FASTEST WAY TO IN THIS CASE YOU CAN MAKE CHANGES THEY DID. IT IS A RESULT HEARING TODAY HAVE THE SECRETARY STATE TAKE A LOOK AT THERE'S SOME CONFUSION. A FIX IT AND BUT ULTIMATELY FOCUSES WHICH IS MY FOCUS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT MOTOR VOTER ENACTED SINCE NINETEEN NINETY THREE THANK YOU- IS A WORKS AS BEST AS POSSIBLE I THINK THAT WOULD BE THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION.

THEY DID HAVE THIS BEFORE US YES IT IS WELCOME THAT SAID- I BELIEVE THERE MAY BE SOME GROUNDS FOR AMENDMENTS THAT BECAUSE WE CANNOT GET THEM BEFORE US TODAY BUT I WOULD MOVE THE BILL THAT WE MIGHT MOVE IT ALONG AND HAVE A AUTHORS WORK WITH THE CHAIR TOWARDS SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS OF THE SUGGESTION TO YOU OF AND I THINK THAT HAS MERIT AT LEAST SO I WOULD MOVE THE BILL TO KEEP IT ALIVE FOR THAT PURPOSE.
