NO PROBLEM ALL RIGHT THAT BRINGS US TO ITEM SEVEN EIGHT HUNDRED NEEDS THE ITEMS TO BE HEARD TODAY. YES. OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARKET ARE DUE TO DIRECTOR OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES GREAT TO BE WITH YOU THIS AFTERNOON -- WE HAVE TWO ITEMS THAT -- WE HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY FOR CONSIDERATION -- LET ME PREFACE BY JUST BY -- SORT OF FRAMING THAT YOU KNOW AS AS THE OBVIOUS THAT YOU ALL KNOW THAT -- HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCE -- YOU KNOW FOR SEVERAL DEVASTATING DISASTERS OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS -- AND AND IN FACT -- IF YOU THINK ABOUT -- SINCE IT IT LITERALLY TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN WE'VE HAD WELL OVER A HUNDRED STATE OF EMERGENCIES AND THE DISASTERS WE FACE HAVE RESULTED IN. FOURTEEN PRESIDENTIAL DISASTER DECLARATION THIS UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF PRESIDENTIAL DISASTER DECLARATIONS -- PRESIDENTIAL DISASTER DECLARATIONS WOULD START OFF AT AT A MINIMUM OF FIFTY SIX FIFTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN INFRASTRUCTURE DESTRUCTION -- AND THEN THAT WAS THE ALL THE WRAPAROUND IMPACTS TO TO OUR COMMUNITIES -- THAT IS ALL RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WORKLOAD IN EFFORT ON THE PART OF STATE AGENCIES AND AND THE OFFICER MERGING SERVICES. IN FACT IN JUST SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN ALONE -- WE HAD THE THE LOSS OF OVER. THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND STRUCTURES THAT'S HOMES AND BUSINESSES DESTROYED -- AND OF COURSE AS WE UNFORTUNATELY NO THREE HUNDRED FATALITIES AND IN THE CAMPFIRE ALONE LAST YEAR WERE EIGHTEEN THOUSAND STRUCTURES THAT WERE DESTROYED -- THIS IS BEEN IN ADDITION WHILE FIRE IS REALLY THE FOCUS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT LAST FEW WEEKS BUT WE HAVE EXPERIENCED IN THE LAST -- SEVERAL YEARS EARTHQUAKES FLOODS -- FAILURES OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE -- THIS BILL WAY -- TERRORIST ATTACK ACTIVE SHOOTERS EXCEPT FOR A THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO WE'VE BEEN VERY VERY BUSY AND I'LL COME BACK TO THAT IN. A FEW MINUTES BECAUSE IT SPEAKS TO ONE OF THE THE PER POLLS WILL MAKING I WANT TO START OFF BY. TALKING A LITTLE ABOUT WHILE FAR THOUGH AND SPECIFICALLY -- IN THE EFFORT -- ACROSS ALL OF THE DIFFERENT ENTITIES TO PREPARE FOR THIS YEAR'S WILDFIRE SEASON THAT'S UPON US NOW -- WE HAVE BEEN ENGAGED VERY VERY EXTENSIVELY WITH THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES AND THEY HAVE SIGNAL TO US THEIR INTENT TO INCREASE THE USE. OF WHAT THEY CALL -- PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF THIS IS A PREEMPTIVE -- SHOT OFF OF POWER IN ADVANCE OF POTENTIAL -- FIRE START SO -- GIVEN A SERIES OF CONDITIONS WEATHER HUMIDITY WIND EXCEPT FOR A THEY WILL THEY WILL MAKE AN EVALUATION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE GOING TO SHUT OFF THEIR POWER AND OF COURSE -- SHUTTING OFF POWER IN THE SHORT RUN FOR A FEW HOURS -- IS -- MANAGEABLE SUSTAINABLE SHUTTING OFF POWER OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL DAYS -- UP TO TEN OR FIFTEEN DAYS IS A MUCH DIFFERENT STORY AND AND AND WE WE ARE WORKING WITH THEM AND HAVING THEM WORK WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- TO PREPARE FOR THE POTENTIAL CASCADING IMPACTS OF THE WORST CASE SCENARIO OF OF THEM -- SHUTTING DOWN THE POWER THROUGHOUT THE STATE OVER PROPER LONG PERIOD OF TIME -- AS A PART OF THAT IS OUR EFFORT TO BUILD -- RESILIENCY AND RELIABILITY. IN THE STATE'S ABILITY TO RESPOND -- EFFECTIVELY TO THESE CASCADING IMPACTS -- AND THAT IS ONE OF THE WE HAS BEEN MADE HERE THERE IS A REQUEST -- FOR ONE TIME GENERAL FUND ALLOCATION TO TO BUILD RESILIENCY IN THE STATE'S CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE -- IN IN RESPONSE TO THESE -- POWERSHOT OFFICE -- AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN PREPARING -- FOR THE THE SHUT OFF AND AND REALLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN THE TIER. TWO AND TIER -- THREE SERVE US -- SEVERE AND EXTREME -- FIRES AS I HAVE A MAP BEHIND ME -- THAT YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE -- BETWEEN THE TIER TWO WHICH IS ELEVATED WHICH IS THE YELLOW AND TIER THREE WHICH IS THE EXTREME. AND OVERLAID IN THE EXTREME AND THE ELEVATED OR A NUMBER OF STATE -- CRITICAL FACILITIES THAT ARE USED -- IN RESPONSE OPERATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN SUPPORT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- SO THE FIRST PART OF THIS IS HIS HARDENING -- THOSE GROUP DOES A CRITICAL FACILITIES -- BY -- PROCURING ANY UP AND PUTTING IN PLACE -- MERGES YOU BACK UP POWER REALLY THAT IS THE FOCUS OF OF THIS -- PIECE OF THE HARDENING OF THIS INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS CAL FIRE STATIONS -- YES -- REGIONAL OPERATIONS CENTERS EMERGENCY OPERATION CENTERS -- THAT IS CDC OUR THAT IS OUR STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION -- TIER ONE FOOD DISTRIBUTION WAREHOUSES IN THE FIRES OWNS THESE ARE CRITICAL FACILITIES DID YOU CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE EMERGENCY BACKUP POWER -- AND AND THIS WOULD BE -- ALLOCATING -- ROUGHLY SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS -- TO SUPPORT -- THE PROCUREMENT AND AND AND I HOOK UP OF THESE -- OF THESE GENERATORS AND OTHER KINDS OF POWERS WAS NOT A SORRY ALL GENERATOR SOME COULD BE BATTERY BACKUP AND OTHER KINDS OF OF MODERN -- CAPABILITIES THE OTHER PIECE OF THIS IS -- SUPPORT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN THE FORM OF GRANTS -- THE THESE WOULD BE GRANTS TO THE FIFTY EIGHT ARE WHAT WE CALL OPERATIONAL AREAS OR COUNTIES -- TO BE ABLE TO UPDATE TO DO SEVERAL THINGS ONE IS TO UPDATE THEIR OWN THEIR EMERGENCY PLAN TO INCLUDE AN ANNEX FOR PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF -- THIS IS A NEW CONCEPT -- BUT I'LL USE IT BEEN WORKING WITH THE COUNTIES AND WE KNOW THAT THE THAT THE EMERGENCY -- YOU KNOW THE SPECIFICS REGARDING PSP **** -- ARE NEW AND WE WANT TO GET THAT INCORPORATED THEIR EMERGENCY PLANS. IT ALSO WOULD ALLOW THEM TO CONVENE REGIONAL STAKEHOLDER. MEETINGS AND AND AND AND DISCUSSIONS SUMMITS AND AND HOLD TRAINING AND EXERCISES TO RE IN. THOSE PLANNING ASSUMPTION SO THAT'S BRINGING YOUR FIRE LAW ENFORCEMENT PUBLIC HEALTH -- AND THE COMMUNITY TOGETHER IN SOME TOWN HALL MEETINGS WITH REGARDS -- TO THE LOCAL -- GOVERNMENT AND INDIVIDUALS WITH ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS A HUGE COMPONENT OF OF OF GROUP -- THAT -- REALLY ARE IMPACTED THE MOST -- BY ONE OF THESE POWERSHOT OFFICE -- AND THEN OF COURSE THAT WOULD BE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A PROGRAM TO SUPPORT WHEN THE I USE -- THESE ARE I USED LED THE COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS THESE ARE CENTERS THAT THEY WILL SET UP FOR POWER -- AND INFORMATION FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT MAY BE AND IT IS KNOWN THAT MAY HAVE THEIR POWER TURNED OFF -- HAVING LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- BUILD THAT INTO THEIR RESPONSE CAPABILITIES. SO -- ON THE FIRST -- OUR REQUEST IS THIS ISSUE OF OF THESE THIS -- ENHANCED -- RESILIENCY CAPABILITY -- FOR STATE FACILITIES AND FOR SUPPORTING LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN PREPARATION OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF -- ANY QUESTION ABOUT THAT BEFORE YOU GO TO CHANGE COMING FROM LA -- FROM FINANCE. NO LL NINE CHRISTY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO IN GENERAL WE THINK THIS CONCEPT MAKES SENSE CERTAINLY POWER SHUT OFF CAN BE DEVASTATING TO COMMUNITIES IN CAN PRESENT LINE PUBLIC LIFE AND AND SAFETY CONCERNS -- HOWEVER AT THIS TIME WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A LACK OF CLARITY ON SOME OF THE DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL AND EXACTLY HOW THEY CAME UP WITH THIS PROPOSED SPENDING AMOUNT. OF AND HOW TO COORDINATE WITH THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES -- IF AT ALL AND THAT AND SO WE WE THINK THAT IF THE LEGISLATURE'S INTERESTED IN PURSUING THIS CONCEPT -- THE TO CONSIDER WE SUGGEST TO CONSIDER MODIFYING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- WE PROVIDE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER AS IT DOES SO ON THAT COULD BE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT FURTHER SPECIFIES HOW THESE FUNDS COULD BE USED ON IT COULD BE. PROVIDING FUNDING ONLY FOR NINETEEN TWENTY SO THIS THIS PROPOSED FUNDING WOULD WOULD BE FOR THREE YEARS IT COULD BE A LIMITING ITS ONE YEAR AND HAVING SOME REPORTING. I'M IT COULD ALSO BE ON MAKING CONTINGENT ON PROVIDE THAT ADMINISTRATION PROVIDING A MORE DETAILED PLAN SO THEY'RE READY DIFFERENT OPTIONS THEY'RE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE -- THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER I'M JUST IMPROVE A LITTLE BIT OF THE OVERSIGHT AND TO GET SOME MORE DETAILS ON THIS PROPOSAL WHICH WHICH IS THAT CERTAINLY VERY IMPORTANT BUT AT WE THINK LACKS IN DETAIL AT THIS POINT. THANK YOU ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FOR MEMBERS YES MISTER OPEN OKAY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SO I SHARE THE LA THOSE CONCERNS THE I THINK WE'RE ALL UNITED IN OUR IN OUR INTENTION -- TO TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE HARDENED AGAINST THESE POWER SHUT OFF EVENTS BUT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR BACKUP GENERATORS AS A LOT OF MONEY. AND I THINK THAT I'D LIKE TO SEE SOME MORE SPECIFICITY IN TERMS OF HOW EXACTLY YOU PROPOSED TO SPEND THAT MONEY -- BEFORE THE OTHER VOTES TAKEN ON THIS IF YOU WOULD PLEASE. SURE I MEAN I I MAY JUST ADD THAT IT WE DID A SURVEY OF THE STATE DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE A RESPONSE RESPONSIBILITY OR HAVE CRITICAL FACILITIES LIKE CDC ARE LIKE STATE HOSPITALS LIKE -- DEPARTMENT OF BAD AS AS WELL AS THE RESPONSE ORGANIZATIONS LIKE CAL FIRE AND AND WE ASSN C. H. P. -- YOU MAY BE SURPRISED TO KNOW THAT THEIR THEIR ART. EMERGENCY BACKUP -- POWER AT MOST OF THESE FACILITIES FOR LOTS OF DIFFERENT REASONS -- AND SO THE SURVEY IS NOT ASKING EVERY STATE AGENCY. IT'S NOT ASKING EVERY EVERY STATE AGENCY THAT EVEN IS IN THAT TIER ONE OR TWO IT'S REALLY THOSE. THOSE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES THAT HAVE -- A CRITICAL ROLE -- IN SUPPORTING THE COMMUNITY IN THE CASCADING IMPACTS BUT I MEAN I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE WHERE YOU'RE AT AND AND HAPPY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AS WE CONTINUE TO EVOLVE THIS -- IF YOU COULD JUST PROVIDE THAT BREAK DOWN THAT YOU JUST MENTIONED ABOUT HOW YOU ARRIVED AT THE SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR FIGURE YOU KNOW WHO WHO WOULD GET THE BACKUP GENERATORS NEED TO PROJECTED COST OF THEM. THINK THAT BE VERY HELPFUL SHARE THAT BE HAPPY THAT YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. ANY COMMENTS FROM THE AUDIENCE. JUST GIVE US YOUR NAME AND THE AGENCY THAT YOU REPRESENT ENTRY IN FAVOR OF THE PROPOSAL. A GOOD AFTERNOON CARE MORTENSEN ON THE UP THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION -- WE WOULD ALSO -- I AGREE WITH LA OWES COMMENTS -- AND SUPPORT SOME BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT ADDED A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT OR SPECIFICS -- TO THE DETAILS AS THERE'S A AS DIRECTOR YOUR DUE TO MENTION THERE'S A TREMENDOUS NEED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE P. YOU SEE ON THE RULE MAKING PROCESS. AND COMMUNICATION OUT REACH TO RESIDENTS WITH IN JURISDICTIONS THAT WILL HAVE A PEAK POWER SHUT DOWN IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IN ADDITION TO PLANNING -- AND ALSO CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE REDUNDANCY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IS A NECESSARY AS WELL THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. OKAY ANY UP THING FOR MEMBERS THIS ITEMS BEING HELD OPEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH ITEM NUMBER EIGHT WHICH IS THE MAYBE VISION DISASTER PLANNING PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE PROPOSAL GREAT THANK YOU SO THIS -- ONE OF BOB SORT OF BOB CONNECTS BACK WITH MY OPENING STATEMENT ABOUT THE THE AMOUNT OF DISASTERS WE SEEN IN IN CONTINUE -- TO EXPERIENCE -- AND AND AND THIS PROPOSAL IS IS IS YOU A LITTLE BIT UNIQUE WE WE WE WE WORKED WITH -- WITH ADMINISTRATION -- TO DEVELOP -- A CAPABILITY THAT REALLY SPEAKS TO AN ISSUE OF SUSTAINMENT AND AND ABILITY TO DEAL WITH THESE ON ON SLOT OF OF NON -- AND BEING A MEMBER DISEASE A DISASTER SO THIS ONE IS -- A A PROGRAM THAT WOULD FIND. SEVEN MILLION IN GENERAL FUND AND AND ROUGHLY EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND IN FEDERAL TRUST FUND -- FOR NINETY FOUR POSITIONS -- AT YES BEGINNING IN -- NINETEEN TWENTY TO SUPPORT ALL OF THIS ACTIVITY IN. RESPONSE PLANNING PREPAREDNESS -- EXCEPT TRUCK AND WE BROKEN THIS DOWN -- INTO -- THREE DIFFERENT. BUCKETS ARE PROBLEMS IF YOU WHAT AND REALLY IT IS -- IN ESSENCE A IN INNOVATIVE WAYS NOT JUST A BIG DUMP OF A BUNCH OF PEOPLE BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT IT IN THE IN A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WAYS OF BUILDING CAPACITY THE FIRST ONE IS THAT WE HAVE. CURRENTLY HAVE A NUMBER OF LIMITED TERM. POSITIONS THAT WE'VE HAD TO US STAFF UP -- FOR THESE EMERGENCIES AND OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST -- SEVERAL EMERGENCIES -- AND AND IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE WERE ASKING THAT THESE LIMITED TERMS BE -- CONVERTED TO PERMANENT POSITIONS THE SUPPORT THE ONGOING WORKLOAD AND AND THE VARIOUS AREAS OF THE DEPARTMENT -- AND AND AND JUST -- JUST THE BACKLOG AND REMEMBER I I MENTION TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN BUT WE ACTUALLY HAVE OPEN DISASTERS -- THAT -- GO BACK ALL WAIT ABOUT-- TWO THOUSAND THREE BECAUSE A LOT OF YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE DISASTERS AND SO A LOT OF THIS GETS PUT OFTEN PUT OFF WITH REGARDS TO THE NEW DISASTERS YOU ONLY HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF RESOURCES TO GO AROUND -- AND SO THE FIRST PART IS IS -- LIMITED TERM CONVERSION DEPARTMENT AT ROUGHLY THIRTY SIX POSITIONS THE SECOND PART OF THAT IS A NEW POSITION% REQUEST -- ROUGHLY FORTY POSITIONS -- THESE ARE AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE -- IDENTIFIED A POSITION THAT IDENTIFIED CRITICAL POSITIONS IN GAPS THAT WE HAVE -- EXPERIENCE IN THE CURRENT -- THIS SERIES OF DISASTERS -- THAT WE KNOW -- WE NEED -- ONE KEY THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT. AT A WE ASK WHICH IS UNIQUE IS THAT WE ARE PLANNING A PREPARING IN PEACETIME -- AND AND AND TRAINING AND EXERCISES WHEN WE RESPOND RESPONDING WITH WITH ALL THE OTHER PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES. MANY THIS PUBLIC AGENCIES AGENCIES AFTER THE RESPONSES OVER GO BACK TO THEIR STEADY STATE A WE ASK CONTINUES WITH THE RECOVERY OPERATIONS. TO BE ABLE TO RECOVER AND WILL FAR BEFORE THOSE RECOVERY OPERATIONS ARE OVER WE'RE BACK INTO EMERGENCY RESPONSE SO IT'S ALMOST A SELF LOOKING ICE CAN GO WE CAN. CONTINUALLY HAVE -- THE NEED -- TO RESPOND AND WHEN WE HAVE A WE HAVE A A RESOURCE PROBLEM DOING THAT AND THAT THIS A SECOND PRONG -- THIS PART OF THIS FIRST -- BUCK AND AT IN OTHER WORDS WOULD TO INCLUDE -- FORTY NEW POSITIONS TO HELP ADDRESS THAT -- THE SECOND. PRONG OR BUCKET IS -- WHAT WE CALL MISSION TASKING -- FUND APPROPRIATION THIS IS A NEW PROGRAM -- MANY TIMES WE ARE MISSION TASKING OTHER STATE AGENCIES TO BE ABLE TO STEP UP AND RESPONDED AND EMERGENCY OR PARTICIPATE IN THE RECOVERY -- THESE THESE AGENCIES ARE NOT GENERALLY FUNDED FOR THAT. AND IT'S A CONTINUAL CHALLENGE -- TO BE ABLE TO GET RESOURCES AND AGENCIES COMMITTED OVER A PERIOD OF TIME -- WITHOUT HAVING TO GO BACK FOR DEFICIENCIES OR OTHER KINDS OF ASPECTS IN THIS IN ESSENCE IS A PROPOSAL THAT WOULD INCLUDE TWENTY MILLION. TO GOING TO A OF A FIND -- THAT WOULD FIND STATE AGENCIES THAT HAVE BEEN MISSION TASK BY -- YES -- TO IMMEDIATELY GIVEN THAT FRONT LOADED TO FIND DEAN -- SO THERE'S NOT A QUESTION OF HOW THEY GONNA PAY AND PUT THEIR BUDGETS IN A CRISIS SITUATION -- END UP PART OF ADDING INCLUDES -- UP SOME POSITIONS PROPOSITIONS TO ADMINISTER THAT FINE AND AND TRACK THIS IS CRITICAL BECAUSE THIS ALSO -- TRACKS THE AMOUNT OF RECOVERY DOLLARS THAT WE GET FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- FOR DISASTER RESPONSE AND IN ESSENCE THIS AT THIS INITIATIVE REALLY WOULD PAY FOR ITSELF BY HAVING VERY -- CLEAR -- AFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT WAYS OF BEING ABLE -- TO RAPIDLY GET OUR FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT BACK WE WANT TO MAXIMIZE WAS FEDERAL REIMBURSE BACK PARTICULARLY IN CURRENT. POLITICAL CLIMATE IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE ALL OF OUR RESOURCES APPROPRIATELY -- IN LINE -- TO MAXIMIZE OUR FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENTS. AND THEN THE LAST PIECE OF THAT -- IS A CONTINUITY AND SEARCH CAPACITY THIS IS REALLY -- AN INTERESTING -- IDEA TO BE ABLE TO BUILD IN ESSENCE A STATEWIDE DISASTER RESERVE CORPS. THIS IS REALLY AN INVESTMENT -- ON THE FRONT END -- TO BUILD -- INDIVIDUALS RETIREES -- FROM LOCAL STATE OR FEDERAL OR PRIVATE SECTOR THEY WANT TO BECOME A RESERVIST WITH US THAT HAVE A TECHNICAL EXPERTISE THAT WE COULD BRING TO THE TABLE AND USED DURING AN EMERGENCY -- AND THIS WOULD ALLOW US TO BUILD THAT RESERVE CORPS AND PROVIDE SOME TRAINING FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND WE WOULD ONLY CALL THEM WHEN NEEDED. AND WE WOULD EMPLOY THEM TO SUPPORT -- I WAS IN A MAJOR DISASTER AND IT WOULD REALLY BY DOWN THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT WE HAVE TO GO OUT AND BRING IN. PRE VET CONTRACTS AND TRY TO TRACKDOWN AND BUILD UP RESOURCES SO -- THIS IS REALLY A A PROGRAM MODELED AFTER THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- AND FEMALE WHERE THEY'VE GOT A DISASTER RESERVE -- PROGRAM AND IT'S BEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL -- IN COST EFFECTIVE IN BEING ABLE -- TO MANAGE THAT PROGRAM SO THAT IS IN ESSENCE THE SECOND -- REQUEST THAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU SOUNDS GOOD OKAY ANY COMMENTS FROM L. FROM FINANCE. MANAGER STEVE EVENTS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS PART OF A LARGER ADMINISTRATION STATEWIDE PACKAGE THE THAT FIRST PRONG THAT THE DIRECTOR SPOKE ABOUT WITH THE CAN BASS LINE. INCREASES IN RESOURCES AFFECTS EIGHT DEPARTMENTS IT WAS KIND OF REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT AND TARGETED WAYS TO TRY AND LIFT THE THE RAISE THE BOAT IF YOU WILL. ACROSS THE STATE IN TERMS OF OUR PREPAREDNESS TO RESPOND THESE EMERGENCIES AND SO IT'S KIND OF REAL INTERCALL AND HOW THESE ALL WORK TOGETHER [inaudible] HELLO. AS WE HAVE A FEW COMMENTS AS WAS NOTED THERE ARE THREE SEPARATE COMPONENTS OF THIS -- REQUEST ALL GO THROUGH THEM -- SEQUENTIALLY THE FIRST BEING THAT -- YES STAFF RESOURCES -- WE WOULD NOTE THAT IN MANY CASES OTHER QUEST SO CONCLUDES BASICALLY BROAD -- AUGMENTATIONS ACROSS A VARIETY OF P. PARTS OF THE DEPARTMENT THAT INCLUDES THINGS LIKE YOUR CYBERSECURITY INTEGRATION CENTER AS WELL AS THEIR PLANNING ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS THEIR RESPONSE TRACKING AT HR AND YEAH IT'S JUST IT'S VERY BROAD ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT. AND WE WOULD NOTE THAT IN MANY CASES THEIR QUEST PROVIDES A BROAD DESCRIPTION OF THE GENERAL TYPE OF ACTIVITY THAT SECTION DOES OR MAYBE EVEN THOSE POSITIONS -- BUT IT'S OFTEN UNCLEAR SPECIFICALLY WHAT THE CURRENT LEVEL OF SAID STAFFING IS FOR THOSE ACTIVITIES WHAT THE SPECIFIC GAPS ARE AS WELL AS WHY THE SPECIFIC NUMBER OF PERSONNEL ARE REQUESTED AND SO. AND WE THINK THAT THERE'S THERE'S A LACK OF OF SORT OF THAT DETAILED INFORMATION THAT WE WOULD WE WOULD IDEALLY LIKE TO SEE. ACCORDINGLY WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE SEEK THIS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION -- IF THE DEPARTMENT ISN'T ABLE TO PROVIDE IT -- IN TIME FOR THIS BUDGET WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER REJECTING ON THEIR QUEST IN WHOLE OR IN PART OR COULD ALSO AS POTENTIALLY APPROVED A NEW POSITIONS ON A LIMITED TERM BASIS AND THAT WOULD NOT HAVE THEM COME BACK AND PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL AT THAT POINT -- WITH REGARD TO THE SECOND PIECE THE MISSION TASKING THAT THAT TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR FUND AS WELL AS THAT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE TWELVE POSITIONS TO ADMINISTER THAT -- WE KNOW THAT THE CONCEPT OF ESTABLISHING SUCH A FIND -- IS CERTAINLY A PROMISING ONE HOWEVER AGAIN -- IT'S INCLUDE US EXACTLY HOW THAT -- BUT THE BASIS IS FOR THAT FUNDING AMOUNT AND AND IN TERMS OF THE THE STOP LEVEL OF STAFF RESOURCES IT'S UNCLEAR TO US -- WHETHER THAT'S THE RIGHT LEVEL -- PARTICULARLY WOULD NOTE THAT -- THAT FINDINGS REQUESTED FOR THOSE POSITIONS ON AN ONGOING BASIS -- WELL THE FIND WOULD ONLY BE SPENT OVER THE NEXT ROUGHLY THREE YEARS AND SO ON THERE'S ALSO SOME QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER ON GOING FUNDING IS APPROPRIATE AND CASE. ACCORDINGLY RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE SEEK ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON ON THE STAFF LEVEL AND IT CERTAINLY IF THE LEGISLATURE THINKS THAT THE GENERAL CONCEPT OF THIS FIND MAKES SENSE WE RECOMMEND -- THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER CONSIDER -- IMPLEMENTING AS A PILOT PROJECT -- SO IT COULD FOR EXAMPLE PROVIDE THE FUNDING ON A FOR THE POSITIONS ON A LIMITED TERM BASIS -- EITHER IN WHOLE OR IN PART -- ESTABLISH PERHAPS YOU COULD ESTABLISH OUT REQUIRE THAT THEY THAT THEY HAVE THE FUND IN PLACE FOR YOU HAVE SAY A YEAR AND THEN COMMON REPORT BACK ON ON KIND OF WHAT THEY'VE DONE WITH IT AND AND HOW IT'S WORKING. WE THINK THAT'LL IMPROVE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT AND ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE UNDERSTAND SIR BUT IT'S FUNDING AND WHAT THE OUTCOMES ARE -- AND THEN WITH REGARD TO THE THIRD PIECE THAT WAS THAT I SAID ROUGHLY SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SIX POSITIONS FOR THAT. A DISASTER RESERVE CORPS -- REALLY THESE FOLKS AS WE UNDERSTAND IT ARE GONNA BE DOING THE RESEARCH TO IDENTIFY HOW THIS WOULD BE DONE SO THEY THEY'LL BE KIND OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THIS NEW PROGRAM WOULD BE RYAN -- AGAIN WE THINK THAT THE IDEA OF THIS HAS HAD QUITE A BIT OF PROMISE BUT THERE'S ALSO A LACK OF DETAIL HERE. ACCORDINGLY -- SIMILAR TO THAT THE PREVIOUS COMPONENTS BE SUGGEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE SEEK THESE ADDITIONAL DETAILS -- IF THAT ISN'T AVAILABLE -- BUT AGAIN IF THE LEGISLATURE THINK THAT THIS IS A CONCEPT WORTH PURSUING WE RECOMMEND -- APPROVING THE POSITIONS -- AND FUNDING ON A TWO YEAR LIMIT TERM BASIS AGAIN WITH SOME REPORTING. SO ADDICTED LEGISLATURE HAVE A SENSE OF HOW THIS -- THIS NEW IDEA OF A RESERVE CORPS IS WORKING AND WHETHER WANTS TO CONTINUE INVESTING IN IT OKAY THANK YOU. ANY COMMENTS YES I COULD JUST MAKE ONE CLARIFICATION ON THAT SECOND PRONG THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE MISSION TASKING. IS ONE TIME SO IF WE WANTED TO DO A SIMILAR THING IN FUTURE YEARS WE WOULD BE BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE TO ASK FOR THAT IT'S IT'S A ONE TIME REQUEST. THANK YOU ARE A PART BROAD RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT IT'S NEW AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT KIND RIGHT LEVEL IS AND IT'LL VERY BY. WHAT DISASTERS WE HAVE ANY PARTICULAR YEAR? OKAY THANK YOU THREE COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS THE QUESTION. ANY COMMENTS FROM THE AUDIENCE. THANK YOU THIS ITEM WILL BE HELD OPEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

OUR EXISTING SEVENTY THREE JUDGES AND FIFTEEN COMMISSIONERS DO THE WORK OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX JUDGES THAT'S ONE AND A HALF JUDGES -- FOR THE AMOUNT OF CALENDARS THAT WE HAVE. JUDGES IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY ALSO SHARE THIS BURDEN AS TO FIFTEEN OTHER COUNTIES. GIVEN THE HOUSING BOOM IN SOUTHWEST RIVERSIDE AND THE HIGH DESERT AND WEST END OF SAN BERNADINE OUT THE SITUATION WILL ONLY WORSEN. ON MONDAY BY WAY OF EXAMPLE I WAS VISITING THE VICTORVILLE COURTHOUSE AND HAD LUNCH WITH THE SUPERVISING JUDGE SHE HAD JUST FINISHED A HUNDRED MATTER MISTER MEANER ARRAIGNMENT CALENDAR. AND AFTER LUNCH HAD A HUNDRED MATTERS MORE TO GO -- MISTER MUNIS USUALLY HAVE DRUG PROBLEMS ALCOHOL PROBLEMS MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS. ON THIS CALENDAR THE AVERAGE JUST THIRTY SECONDS A IN ORDER FOR THE DEFENDANT TO UNDERSTAND -- WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE COURTROOM AND BE ABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS? ON TUESDAY I PULL THE CALENDAR FOR FAMILY COURT OVER THIRTEEN FAMILY COURT ROOMS. WE HAD TWENTY THREE CUSTODY VISITATION. AND SUPPORT ORDERS OR HEARINGS GOING ON IN EACH OF THE COURT ROOMS SO IN ORDER TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR WHERE A CHILD IS GOING TO BE -- FOR VISITATION AND FOR SUPPORT. THAT'S ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES PER FAMILY TO MAKE DECISIONS ON CRISIS. IN OUR JUVENILE DEPENDENCY COURT ROOMS WE HAVE FOUR JUDGES COURT WIDE. OUR NEW FILINGS ARE EIGHT HUNDRED FILINGS PER YEAR PER JUDGE ANY CARRY AN ACTIVE CASELOAD OF OVER EIGHT HUNDRED FAMILIES. THE NEED FOR MORE JUDGES HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED SINCE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS WHEN WE BEGAN ANALYZING THE WORKLOAD. AND LEGISLATION HAS FIRST BEEN INTRODUCED IN TWO THOUSAND SIX AND SUBSEQUENTLY SINCE THEN. OUR COMMUNITY IS IN NEED IS IN DESPERATE NEED OF JUDGES ESPECIALLY IN THE REMOTE AREAS OF OUR COUNTY WHERE CAN TAKE THREE AND A HALF HOURS BY CAR RIGHT TO GET TO A COURT ROOM. OR IS A TWELVE HOUR DAY BY PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. SO THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING OUR PROPOSALS AND MAY I ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME OKAY. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM LEAH ROSE GOOD WHEN I AM THE MANAGER OF THE OFFICE OF COURT RESEARCH AT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. AND IT IS OF MY OFFICE THAT BUT DOES THE ASSESSMENT OF JUDICIAL NEEDS. I JUST AS A REMINDER THE JUDICIAL NEEDS ASSESSMENT IS A BIENNIAL REPORT THAT ARE A JUDICIAL BRANCH PRODUCES THAT SHOWS THE NEED FOR JUDGESHIPS BASED ON WORKLOAD. THE JUDGE MODEL HAS THREE BASIC COMPONENTS ONE IS THAT IT IS BASED ON A THREE YEAR AVERAGE OF FILENE'S AND WE MEASURE FILINGS IN DIFFERENT CASE TYPES. OF FAMILY LAW CIVIL AND CRIMINAL. A IT IS ALSO BASED ON WORKLOAD STANDARDS ALSO CALLED CASE WEIGHTS THAT MEASURE THE FULL AMOUNT OF TIME THAT CASES OF VARIOUS STATE TYPES TAKE. FROM FILING THROUGH DISPOSITION AND INCLUDING ANY POST DISPOSITION ACTIVITY. AND FINALLY THE THIRD COMPONENT OF THE MODEL IS A PRIORITIZATION METHOD. THAT DETERMINES IN WHAT ORDER JUDGES SHOULD BE ALLOCATED. IN IT REFLECTS COUNCIL PRIORITIES -- OVER THE LAST DECADE AS WELL AS IT IS CODIFIED IN GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION. SIX NINE SIX ONE FOUR AT THE COUNCIL PRIORITIES. FOR JUDICIAL ALLOCATION ARE BASICALLY TO CONSIDER COURTS WITH THE GREATEST WORKLOAD NEED. BUT TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO COURTS FOR THE GREATEST NUMBER OF USERS. I TO KEEP IN MIND THE AVAILABILITY OF COURT FACILITIES FOR PLACING NEW JUDGES. AND TO ENSURE THAT SMALL COURTS ARE ELIGIBLE A TO QUALIFY FOR NEW JUDGESHIPS. THE CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE WITH OUR ALLOCATION MODEL. IS ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF COURTS OF VERY DIFFERENT SIZES SO IN SAN BERNADINO FOR EXAMPLE A LARGE JURISDICTION -- THEY NEED THIRTY EIGHT JUDGESHIPS A SMALL CORD. FOR EXAMPLE LIKE LASSEN OR SHASTA MAY NEED ONLY ONE SHOULD SHIP BUT THAT ONE JUDGESHIP REPRESENTS 30% OF THE WORKLOAD NEED IN THAT COURT. SO WE USE A METHOD THAT'S VERY SIMILAR TO HOW SEATS ARE APPORTIONED IN CONGRESS IT'S BASED ON THE EQUAL PROPORTIONS METHOD. AND IT BASICALLY ACCOUNTS. FOR BUT I'D COURTS NUMERIC NEED THEIR PERCENTAGE NEED FOR JUDGESHIP AND ALSO THE RELATIVE NEED FOR THAT FIRST JUDGESHIP. COMPARED TO ALL OTHER JUDGESHIPS NEEDED. BUT THE BRANCHES RIGHT IN THE MIDST OF UPDATING THE CASE WEIGHTS THAT ARE USED TO MEASURE. BY HOW MUCH TIME IS NEEDED FOR CASES OF VARIOUS TYPES LAST UPDATE OF OUR MODEL WAS. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AND THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF NEW TYPES OF WORKLOAD AND CHANGES IN WORKLOAD AS WELL AS CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY -- THAT. HAVE NECESSITATED US TO UPDATE THE MODEL -- THE BRANCH. BUT WE DO KNOW THAT I EVEN WITH A NEW MODEL THAT WE WILL BE SEEN VERY SIMILAR -- THE SAME CHORDS THAT NEED JUDGESHIPS UNDER OUR CURRENT MODEL WILL BE THE SAME CORD SYDNEY JUDGESHIPS UNDER OUR NEW MODEL. WE HAVE ARE HAVING TO OVERCOME MANY YEARS OF NOT HAVING NEW JUDGESHIPS ALLOCATED BUT AT THE SAME TIME POPULATION HOUSING GROWTH -- CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE TO JUDGESHIP NEED. DEFINITELY CONTINUE TO APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSAL THANK YOU ANY COMMENTS. FINANCE. A SHIRT AND WEBER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE REQUESTED JUDGESHIPS HELP ADDRESS JUDICIAL WORKLOAD NEED TO LET THE COURTS MORE EFFICIENTLY HERE MATTERS I WOULD KNOW THAT THEIR QUESTED FUNNY PROJECT IN THE PROPOSAL IS CONSISTENT WITH HISTORICAL FUNDING. ANY COMMENTS EMILIO I NEED TO LEAVE AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- WE GENERALLY DON'T HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE REQUEST WE DID WANT TO NOTE THAT -- UNDER THE JUDICIAL NEEDS ASSESSMENT A WHILE THERE IS AN IDENTIFIED NEED OF TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN JUDGES IN SEVENTY COUNTIES. THERE'S ACTUALLY A COMPATIBLE NUMBER OF JUDGES IN OTHER COURTS THAT ARE IN EXCESS OF OR MORE THAN WHAT THE ASSESSED WORKLOAD NEED DEMONSTRATES. AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THE GOAL IS TO REDISTRIBUTE JUDICIAL RESOURCES TO EQUALIZE -- WORKLOAD THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO CONSIDER RE ALLOCATING -- JUDGESHIPS FROM THOSE THAT HAVE MORE JUDGES AND THEIR THOUGHTS NEED TO THOSE THAT HAVE LESS. OKAY MAY COME AS FOR MEMBERS. EIGHT COMMENTS -- SORRY SOBRE NOTED THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SO. THIS IS A REQUESTED I AM VERY SYMPATHETIC. TO AS SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN ASKING FOR FOR YEARS NOW AND THAT TO TELL YOU WHY I'M SO PASSIONATE ABOUT IT I'VE BEEN LEGISLATURE FIVE YEARS NOW BUT BEFORE THAT. I WAS MAYOR OF A CITY THAT LOST ITS COURTHOUSE JUDE DUE TO A LACK OF JUDGES SO I GOT TO EXPERIENCE FIRST HAND WHAT LACK OF ACCESS TO JUSTICE MEANS FOR A COMMUNITY. AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I'M SO PASSIONATE ABOUT MAKING SURE OUR COURTS HAVE THE JUDGES THAT THEY NEED -- SO THIS IS IT YOU HEARD THE TESTIMONY THAT. JUSTIN SAN MARINO THEY NEED THIRTY EIGHT MORE JUDGES SO TWENTY FIVE STATEWIDE IT IS A GOOD START YOU KNOW WE NEED TO CONTINUE PUSHING FOR MORE. BUT CERTAINLY THIS IS GOING TO BE -- YOU KNOW WELCOME -- WELCOME FIX TO THE SYSTEM ALSO WANT -- TO TO BE VERY COMPLIMENTARY THAT THE REQUEST IT INCLUDES THE STAFF NECESSARY TO FOR THOSE JUDGESHIPS. OFFERED FOR THOSE WERE WORK WATCHING AT HOME ALL ALL TWO OF YOU. YOU KNOW THIS IS THIS REQUEST IS FOR THIRTY SIX AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS FOR TWENTY FIVE JUDGESHIPS AND I'VEACTUALLY GOTTEN A QUESTION THAT'S OVER A MILLION DOLLARS PER JUDGE FOR THOSE JUDGES MAKE A LOT OF MONEY NO NO NO. YOU KNOW THIS IS THERE'S A LOT OF STAFF THAT GOES ALONG WITH EACH JUDGE YOU KNOW CLERKS AREA AND WHAT NOT TO MAKE THE WHOLE SYSTEM FUNCTION AND THAT'S WHY THIS -- THIS REQUEST IS VERY REASONABLE AND ALSO TO LASTLY DO IT ADDRESS THE ALEJO'S COMMENT -- REDISTRIBUTING JUDGES -- I THINK -- THE TERRIBLE WAY OF RESPONDING THAT WOULD BE -- THAT IT THAT HAS LOW POLITICAL FEASIBILITY. SO -- YOU KNOW THIS SEEMS TO BE LIKE THE BILL THE LOW HANGING FRUIT THAT WE CAN DO. TO TO YOU KNOW TO TO ADDRESS THIS NEED IN OUR IN OUR COURTSHIP SO I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- I'M SORRY -- I'M CERTAIN OKAY. WE HAVE A JONES SAWYER COMMON ITEM AND MAKE THIS REAL QUICK AND I AND I WANT TO ECHO -- THE SAME -- CONCERNS WHEN I WHEN I GOT ON THERE WAS A CONCERN. ABOUT PEOPLE TRAVELING TO COURT HOUSES THAT WERE CLOSE. FORGET ABOUT JUST HAVING JUDGES WE WERE CLOSING COURTHOUSES AND WE'RE TRYING TO RE OPEN AGAIN. AND IT WAS YOU KNOW IT WAS HEARTBREAKING TO HEAR OF OF PEOPLE HAVING TO TRAVEL. OF A HUNDRED MILES ON THE BUS. TO GET ACCESS -- TO CIVIL SUITS AND AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE ESPECIALLY WOMEN THAT WERE BATTERED DATE DID GET ON THE BUS GO SOMEWHERE. AND IT WAS CLOSED OR TO HAVE TO GO EVEN FURTHER. AND IT JUST SEEMED TO BE AN ATROCITY SO I IF WE CAN FIGURE THIS OUT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET MORE JUDGES -- ON THE BED SO WE CAN HAVE A SPECIALLY POOR PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS -- TO THEIR CASES -- BUT WE WE JUST NEED TO FIGURE THIS OUT AND GET IT STARTED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. OKAY IN THE COMING FROM THE PUBLIC YES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'M NANCY TRAVELS CEO OF CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA.

IN THE DEFENSE BAR -- WE HAVE BEEN LOBBYING VERY STRONGLY FOR ADDITIONAL JUDGES FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. AND AND WITH OUR NEW GOVERNOR WE HAVE STRONGLY ADVOCATED WITH HIM THAT NOW IS FINE WITH THE TIME TO GET AT LEAST THE TWENTY FIVE ADDITIONAL JUDGES BY NO MEANS DOES IT ADDRESS THE NEED. BUT IT IS A GOOD START AFTER ONLY HAVING TWO JUDGES. DO JUDGES APPROPRIATED. SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN SO IT'S A VERY LONG TIME WITH NO NEW JUDGES. AND FOR OUR FOLKS WHO DO CIVIL CASES WHETHER IT'S ELDER ABUSE OR SEXUAL ASSAULT OR PEOPLE WHO ARE IN CATASTROPHIC PERSONAL INJURY CASES THEY HAVE UNFORTUNATELY BEEN THIS POOR STEP CHILD. SENSE CRIMINAL CASES TAKE THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRECEDENT SO WE HOPE WITH THESE ADDITIONAL JUDGES THAT THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE VERY IMPORTANT CIVIL CASES WHO ARE CATASTROPHICALLY INJURED CAN HAVE THEIR CASES HEARD IN A TIMELY FASHION.

BRING THIS ITEM NUMBER FOUR WHICH IS A MEDICAL CLASS LOCATION MODEL OF DAYS THIS IS A CD SEE OUR PROPOSAL [inaudible] ARE YOU. THIS IS. THE NUMBERS OF FROM WE HAVE A LOT OF LA A LITTLE. TOO BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH THEM THAT'S FINE [inaudible] ARE SOME. OKAY. NO PROBLEM WILL. FOR LA OPAL SEPARATE WITH THIS LAWS THEY DON'T VOTE IT'S OKAY. YES ALL RIGHT -- GOOD MORNING A GOOD AFTERNOON RATHER -- CLARK KELSO RECEIVER -- THE MEDICAL CLASSIFICATION MODEL -- WE'RE HIM ON THE GOVERNOR IS -- MAY REVISION PROPOSAL SEEKS -- HUNDRED AND TWO POSITIONS AND ABOUT TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND -- BUT TO PROVIDE INCREASE STAFFING LEVELS FOR DIRECT PATIENT CARE AN ANCILLARY HEALTH CARE OPERATIONS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA'S PRISONS. ABOUT FIVE OR SIX YEARS AGO WE ADOPTED FOR THE FIRST TIME A STAFFING MODEL. OF FOR MARK CLINICIANS UP PRIOR TO THAT -- BUT BY MY PREDECESSOR RECEIVER -- WITH -- TRAVEL AROUND THE STATE AND SIMPLY DECIDED ON THE NUMBERS. THERE REALLY WASN'T A SYSTEM A MODEL WE ADOPTED A MODEL ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO -- BUT WE HAVE SINCE THEN -- ENOUGH EXPERIENCE WITH THAT MODEL TO REALIZE THAT THERE WERE A COUPLE OF AREAS FOR WE HAD. GAPS -- WE DID NOT HAVE -- AN APPROPRIATE -- ADDITION TO THE MODEL FOR A STAFFING WOMEN'S PRISONS -- WE NEED TO HAVE SOME MORE PROVIDERS PARTICULARLY IN WOMEN'S PRISONS WE DISCOVERED THAT -- WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH. STAFF TO CARE FOR PATIENTS WHO HAVE A VARIETY OF DISABILITIES ON THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT. AND WE DISCOVERED THAT IN THE INPATIENT SETTING OUR OUR MOST OF THE SERIOUSLY ILL -- PATIENTS WE AGAIN WERE A LITTLE BIT SHORT AND WHAT WE'RE SEEKING TO DO HERE IS ESSENTIALLY A JOSH THE MODEL -- SO THAT WE CAN COMPENSATE FOR LOW SHORT FALLS ON A GOING FORWARD BASIS. IF YOU HAVE A COMMENT FROM FINANCE. MICHAEL PLACE BEEN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- WE HOPE TO WORK ON THIS IS AN ONGOING -- ISSUE AND ALSO TO BEGIN ADDRESSING THIS IN THE FUTURE WITH A A REFINED POPULATION. OKAY. BECOMES MELLOW. LUCAS MORROW THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WE NOTE THAT THIS WOULD CHANGE THE CURRENT -- MEDICATION CLASSIFICATION MODEL SAID THAT WHAT NOW IT'S GOING TO BE BASED ON THE QT LEVELS IN POPULATIONS IS WITH THE CHEST THOSE RATIOS. WE NOTE THAT IN PRIOR YEARS THAT MODEL HAS PROVIDE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO MEET THE MEDICAL NEEDS THE POPULATION. AND A CORN YOUR IT APPEARS THAT. THAT MODEL HAS NOT PROVIDE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES. I SUCH A WE FIND THAT IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT THIS MODEL. NON NEEDS TO BE ADJUSTED CURRENTLY BASED ON THE LIMITED AMOUNT OF DATA AND ONLY ONE YEAR ON WHICH IT WASN'T. PROVIDE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES WE RECOMMEND PROVIDING THE FUNDING ON A ONE TIME BASIS. TO ENSURE THAT THE NEEDS ARE MET. FOR THE CURRENT YOUR AND ALLOW US TIME TO IDENTIFY IF THE MODEL NEEDS TO BE CHANGED ON A PERMANENT BASIS. THANK YOU. AB -- COMMENTS FROM [inaudible] MEMBERS. SEC QUICK QUESTION SURE QUESTION. I STARTED SEVEN YEARS AGO I THINK THE RECEIVER WAS HERE BUT YOU ONLY HAD A FEW MORE THINGS TO WORK OUT. ON IT TWO YEARS IS MY SEVENTH YEAR HOW MUCH MORE YOU GOT TO DO. I AM I WILL NOT REPEAT THE MISTAKE OF ANSWERING THAT QUESTION [inaudible] MARTIN. MORE SERIOUSLY -- I HAVE COMPLETED OF THE EVALUATION OF EIGHTEEN OF THE THIRTY FIVE FACILITIES AND DELEGATE IN THE BACK TO THE STATE -- AND I'M ANTICIPATING A CONTINUING -- BUT WITH THAT DELEGATION PROCESS SO -- THERE IS. A PROCESS THAT I HAVE TO GO THROUGH TO EXIT FROM THE CASE. PLEASE ABOUT WHERE. HERE TO YOU OKAY -- WE GOT. THERE THE LA WAS AS RAISE A QUESTION ABOUT THE USE OF ONE YEAR AND SO THAT IT JUST SEEMS IT QUE THEY WE DO NEED SOME ADDITIONAL STAFFING THE QUESTION IS WHETHER NOT THE TRANSIT GOING TO CONTINUE IN THE MANNER THAT THEY HAVE -- THAT YOU OFFERED TO OF THE COVERS ONLY ONE YEAR I ARE WE LOOKING FOR THE CONTINUING INCREASE IN POSITION THIS WILL ONLY HAVE ONE YOUR DATA WHAT THE DOCTOR WEBER THOUGH. THE CHALLENGES WE WE DO KNOW THAT WE NEED -- WE NEED THESE POSITIONS. IF YOU HAVE A ESTABLISH ONLY ON A ONE YEAR BASIS WE CAN ONLY GO AFTER ESSENTIALLY A LIMITED TERM -- TYPE OF EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY WHICH MAKES THESE POSITIONS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE IF IT TURNS OUT THAT WERE WRONG -- WE OBVIOUSLY AND WE HAVE OVER STAFFING AND WE ARE MEASURING PRODUCTIVITY AND BACKLOGS WE HAVE A LOT OF DATA THAT CAN TELL US WHETHER WE HAVE TOO MANY -- WILL CERTAINLY WE WILL COME BACK AND HAVE THAT ADJUSTED. END OF THE POPULATION BEGINS TO DROP FURTHER -- THAT WILL RESULT IN NATURALLY AND A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF BUT PROVIDERS SO -- I I THINK WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS. LET'S SEE HOW THIS WORKS MAKE THE ADJUSTMENT ON A PERMANENT BASIS -- IF THE NUMBER START TO GO DOWN AND POPULATION NUMBERS OF PROVIDERS WILL GO DOWN HELLO. I WOULD MAKE TWO COMMENTS ON THE THE FIRST IS THAT THIS WOULD JUST BE A APPROVING THAT POSITION COUNTY BE CHANGE THE METHODOLOGY SO THAT. IF THE POPULATION WERE TO GO DOWN THE NEED WOULD NECESSARILY GO BACK DOWN BY THE SAME AMOUNT THAT THEY WOULD HAVE PREVIOUSLY AT ACTUALLY A DIFFERENT AMOUNT. I IN TERMS OF THE ONE YOUR BASES AND LIMITED TERM POSITIONS WILL NOTE THAT MANY OF THESE POSITIONS HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO FILL IN THE PAST AND AS A RESULT THE RECEIVER HAS RELIED ON REGISTRY POSITIONS. WE WOULD ANTICIPATE THAT IF THIS WAS APPROVED ON A ONE YEAR BASIS THEY WOULD USE THAT FUNDING FOR REGISTRY SERVICES. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS COMING FROM THE UP -- I'M SORRY FINANCE YES -- I WOULD MAKE A PATIENT FROM FINANCE AGAIN I I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT IN THE SENATE. THE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND CCGS -- EXPECTED EXPRESSED ITS WILLINGNESS TO A PROVIDE ONGOING REPORTING. IN THE USAGE IF THIS I WERE TO GO THROUGH IS AN ON GOING APPROVAL. OKAY SOUNDS GOOD WE PROBABLY WILL ALSO THANK YOU -- ANY COMMENTS NAME AN AGENCY IN POSITION. HELEN ROTH DELTON SEIU LOCAL ONE THOUSAND WE REPRESENT THE WORKERS THE HEALTH WORKERS IN THESE FACILITIES. IF YOU DO THESE ONE TIME YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO USE REGISTRY WHICH IS ABOUT THREE TIMES AS EXPENSIVE AS A REGULAR POSITION. YOU HAVE IN THE OUR ENDS I THINK A 13% VACANCY RATE RHETORICIAN IS A HUGE PROBLEM SO YOU'RE. YOU'RE. USE IT IF YOU DO THIS ONE TIME AND SO MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE. AND IF THEY DON'T NEED AS MUCH THEN THEY THIS WILL JUST BE TAKING CARE OF THROUGH ATTRITION BECAUSE IT'S SO HARD TO RECRUIT GIVEN WHERE THESE FACILITIES ARE LOCATED IN RURAL AREAS. THAT IT THAT JUST SEEMS TO BE A MUCH MORE WASTEFUL WAY OF DOING THINGS THAN ACTUALLY FILL THESE THINGS. AND THEN WAIT FOR ATTRITION THANK YOU. ADRIN MOHAMMED WITH THE UNION OF AMERICAN PHYSICIANS AND DENTISTS I WON'T BELABOR THE POINT AS THE ARE YOU JUST SAID BASICALLY WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY IT MAKES A LOT MORE SENSE TO HAVE. CIVIL SERVICE POSITIONS FILLED AS OPPOSED TO BACK FILLING THEM WITH REGISTRY THAT COST QUITE FRANKLY THREE TIMES AS MUCH IF NOT MORE -- WE HAVE HAD A LONG TERM PROBLEM AND THE ONLY WAY THAT WE HAVE SEEN IT SOLVED A IN MANY PLACES -- PLACES SUCH AS LIKE A STOCKTON BUT STOCKTON PET THAT'S THE AGE THE AFT IS WITH ACTUALLY HAVING CIVIL SERVICE PEOPLE THERE. DOING THE DOING THE WORK BECAUSE THEY OWN THE POSITIONS IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN JUST COME TO AND THEN POSSIBLY LEAVE FOR THREE MONTHS OUT OF THE YEAR OR SOMETHING. WHEN PEOPLE ARE THERE? THEY THEY HAVE A AN OWNERSHIP ALIVE AND AND AN OBLIGATION AND THAT GOES MUCH FURTHER THAN REGISTRY COULD EVER GO AND SO WE IMPLORE YOU TO HAVE THIS NOT BE ONE TIME FUNDING BY ON GOING FUNDING THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. THIS ITEM TWO IS RECOMMENDED TO BE HELD OPEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT BRINGS US TO ITEM NUMBER. SIX WHICH IS THE INTEGRATED SAYS SUBSTANCE ABUSE -- SUBSTANCE USE SKEWS ME DISORDER TREATMENT PROGRAM YEAH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF THE GOVERNOR'S -- A REVISION INCLUDES -- FUNDING OF SEVENTY ONE POINT THREE MILLION GENERAL FUND. OPERATOR OF NINETEEN TWENTY HUNDRED SIXTY ONE POINT NINE MILLION GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION GENERAL FUND IN. TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FOR AN INTEGRATED SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT PROGRAM -- MEMBERS IS YOU YOU'RE ALL VERY WELL AWARE ON THEIR HEELS AN OPIOID CRISIS AND HAS BEEN FOR SEVERAL YEARS -- THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY -- IN CDC ARE WE'VE SEEN ON THE SAME RESULTS OF THAT CRISIS WITH A SPIKE IN THE NUMBER OF VERY SIGNIFICANT SPIKE IN THE NUMBER OF OPIOID -- OVERDOSES -- IN THE IN THE OVERDOSE WAS THAT LEAD TO DEATH -- IT CALIFORNIA'S OF OUR PRISON SYSTEM -- HAS THE DISTINCTION OF HAVING THE HIGHEST RATE. OF OPIOID OVERDOSE DEATHS. BY FAR OF ANY PRISON IN THE COUNTRY. I WORRY WE'RE AT ABOUT THREE TIMES ARE HIGHER RATES OF OPIOID -- OVERDOSE DEATHS -- OF THE PROGRAM -- THAT -- HELLO. IS BEING ASKED FOR IN THIS -- BUDGET PROPOSAL IS BRAND NEW AND WE HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN ATTEMPTING TO TREAT. WITH -- MEDICALLY ASSISTED TREATMENT PROGRAMS -- BUT PRISONERS WHO HAVE -- OPIOID IT AND ALL OTHER -- ABUSE ON DISORDERS -- SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BUILD A PROGRAM ON LARGELY FROM THE GROUND UP -- THE DEPARTMENT HAS ENGAGED IN A VERY SUBSTANTIAL PLANNING EFFORT -- DRAWING UPON THE EXPERIENCE THAT WE'VE HAD IN A PILOT PROGRAM. THAT THE LEGISLATURE OFF AUTHORIZED ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO I BELIEVE -- WE'VE DONE A PILOT IN TWO INSTITUTIONS -- WE HAVE NOW DEVELOPED SOME EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE IN THE OF WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO A FOR THIS TYPE OF TREATMENT PROGRAM. AND WE ARE NOW READY TO ROLL THAT OUT. OF THE THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM. WE WILL BE TARGETING INITIALLY THREE GROUPS OF PATIENTS. FIRST OF THOSE WHO ARE COMING IN TO CDC ARE AND ARE ALREADY ALL ON OF THIS TYPE OF A TREATMENT PROGRAM. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN CONTINUITY OF TREATMENT. PREVIOUSLY PEOPLE HAVE COME IN AND WE JUST HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO OFFER THEM THIS TREATMENT. PROTOCOL SECOND. I'M GONNA BE TARGETING -- PATIENTS WORTH IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF PAROLE OR RELEASE -- TO SEE IF WE CAN PREPARE THEM OFF FOR THE TIME WHEN THE GOING TO WALK OUT THE OF THE GATES AND BE IN THE FREE WORLD -- AND HOPEFULLY. HELP THEM BE IN A BETTER POSITION. ON A TO BE SUCCESSFUL UPON RELEASE I AM NOT TO GO BACK. TO OF IT USING DRUGS AND WITH THEM WHICH CARRIES WITH IT BOTH A HIGHER RISK OF DEATH -- AS WELL AS A RECIDIVIST. OF THE THIRD GROUP -- OF PATIENTS OF WE WILL INITIALLY TARGET OR THOSE WHO ARE HIGH RISK -- ABUSERS. ON THESE WOULD BE PATIENTS WHO HAVE ALREADY SUFFERED AN OVERDOSE FOR EXAMPLE WHERE WE KNOW IT'S VERY LIKELY ONCE YOU'VE DONE THAT -- MEET YOUR IN OF A MUCH HIGHER RISK OF REPEATING -- THERE ARE OTHER CLINICAL INDICATIONS OF A HIGH RISK OF THAT WE WOULD BE USING TO TARGET THOSE -- PATIENTS IN THE INITIAL ROLLOUT. I THANK ALL STOP THEIR HAPPENING ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I HAVE WITH ME DOCTOR AND IT CAME IN -- WHO HELPED LEAD THE PLANNING EFFORT -- UP FOR THIS PROGRAM. COMMENTS FROM FINANCE -- CLING COMING APART A FINANCE -- NOTHING FURTHER OTHER THAN TO SAY THAT -- THE OVERDOSE DEATHS -- IF YOU KNOW IS A STRIKING METRIC THAT REQUIRES ATTENTION -- I THINK -- THE COMMUNITY STANDARD MOVING FORWARD IF PROVIDING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT ALMOST AS A HEALTH CARE DISCIPLINE FOR THOSE THAT NEED IT -- IS APPROPRIATE TO ADDRESS THAT KIND OF STUFF -- SIGNIFICANT -- PROBLEM AND WE THINK THAT THIS PROPOSAL DOES THAT [inaudible] COMMENTS MELLOW. FIGURE THERE SHOULD BE A HANDOUT THAT WAS PROVIDED TO YOU -- GOING TO PAGE ONE OF THAT -- VIEW OF THE GOVERNOR'S ICD T. PROPOSAL THIRTY WERE PROVIDED A PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSAL I WOULDN'T KNOW. THAT A LARGE PORTION OF THIS IS NOT JUST TO INCREASE MA T. BUT ALSO TO INCREASE COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY PROGRAMS AS WELL AS OTHER PROGRAMS AND OR THE DIVISION OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING -- SO WE'RE NOTE THAT IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY THAT WOULD BE FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AND THAT WOULD INCREASE BY AN ADDITIONAL FIFTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS AND TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND NOT BE ON ONGOING BASIS. GOING ON TO PAGE -- TWO WE IDENTIFY UMBER OF ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION -- FIRST OF ALL OF THIS WOULD BE A LARGE SCALE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN UNTESTED PROGRAM. WELL ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE EVIDENCE BASED THIS COMBINATION OF SERVICES HAS NOT BEEN TESTED WITH THESE PARTICULAR PROGRAMS IN MIND -- IN ADDITION SOME ASPECTS OF THE PROS ALL HAVE NOT BEEN EVIDENCE -- ARE NOT OF IN SPACE AND HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED CORRECTIONAL SETTINGS FOR INSTANCE ONE OF THE MEDICATIONS THAT THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BE USED TO TREAT INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD -- CODE USED TO SORT ARE HAS NEVER BEEN TESTED A CORRECTIONAL SETTING. THERE IS ONE PILOT OF IT NOT BEING PROPOSED IN PENNSYLVANIA HOWEVER DID IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES IT WAS SUPPOSED TO LAUNCH IN JANUARY OF TWENTY NINETEEN BUT AS OF THE END OF APRIL HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ENROLL ANY. PARTICIPANTS INTO THE PROGRAM THAT. MEDICATION REFERRING TO IS A LONG LASTING INJECTABLE FORM OF MOVEMENT OR FEELING WHICH COST FOUR TIMES AS MUCH AS THE ORAL PORTIONS OF THE MEDICATION. IN ADDITION -- THE COST ESTIMATES IN THIS PROPOSAL SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY. OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THESE ESTIMATES WERE BASED OFF OF A VARIETY OF SOURCES FROM OTHER STATES AND NOT ARE NOT SO EFFECTIVE OF CDC OURS POPULATION. THIS WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE PRICE. OF THIS PROGRAM GOING. IN A RANGE OF TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM WHAT IS CURRENTLY PROPOSED EITHER UP OR DOWN WARD -- IN ADDITION. THESE ESTIMATES ARE SUBJECT TO ERROR FOR EXAMPLE THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES FIVE MILLION TO PROVIDE. NALOXONE TO INDIVIDUALS BEING RELEASED FROM CDC ARE WITH -- PURITIES DISORDERS -- THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND OFFENDERS HOWEVER THE PROPOSAL. ESTIMATES THAT ONLY FOUR THOUSAND OFFENDERS HAVE A FEW IDEAS DISORDERS. IN ADDITION THE FULL COST OF THIS IMPLEMENTATION IT HAS NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED THE PROPOSAL IS. FOR THREE FIVE THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF THE PROGRAM HOW THE ADMINISTRATION'S NOTED THAT WOULD TAKE AT LEAST FIVE YEARS. TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM WE'RE NOT SURE WHAT THE ADDITIONAL TO YOURS WOULD ENTAIL AND WHAT RESOURCES WOULD BE NECESSARY. IT'S ALSO LIKELY THAT THIS PROPOSAL WILL HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS HAVE NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED OR INCLUDED IN THIS PROPOSAL. FOR INSTANCE I MAY BE A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL CLASSROOM SPACE FOR THE COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY PROGRAMS -- THAT COULD ALSO BE NEEDS FOR ADDITIONAL MEDICATION DISTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE AND SPACE FOR THE STAFF IN. IN ADDITION OUR POTENTIAL IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES WHILE THE OUR PILOTS RIGHT NOW IN THE PRESENT AND THREE PRESENTS FOR MEDICATIONS IS THE TREATMENT. THIS PROPOSAL IS SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE PROPOSALS AS A RESULT THE IT BERMAN TATIAN OF THOSE PILOTS MAY NOT NECESSARILY -- PROVIDE ALL INFORMATION NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT THE CURRENT PILOTS -- INCLUDE ADDITIONAL MEDICATIONS ALSO INCLUDING OVER ALL OF IT ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS AND WOULD BE A MUCH LARGER SCALE THAN WHAT THOSE PILOTS ARE -- THIS ALSO GOES INTO THE RE ENTRY COORDINATION -- ONLY A FEW DOZEN INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN RELEASED FROM THE PILOT PROGRAMS AND WHILE MANY OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN LINKED TO RE ENTRY SERVICES. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BE CREATE A SEPARATE PROCESS FOR ADDRESSING RE ENTRY AND IT WOULD BE DOING SO ON A MUCH LARGER SCALE IT IS NOT CLEAR THAT. IT WOULD BE SUFFICIENTLY LINK THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO SERVICES AND WHETHER OR NOT SOURCES IN THE COMMUNITY FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS. WE ARE NOTE THAT. GOT THE PROPOSAL SAYS AT FIFTY SIX COUNTIES HAVE IMPLEMENTED DIEM CODIS DATA FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES INDICATE THAT ONLY FORTY COUNTY HAVE IMPLEMENTED DIEM CODIS. WHICH IT PROPELLED RIGHT TREATMENT IN THE COMMUNITY. IN ADDITION -- WE FIND THAT THIS PROPOSAL GIVEN LIMITED OVERSIGHT OVER THE CVT PROGRAMS AND NOTE THAT A RECENT AUDIT FOUND THAT. THE CURRENT COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY PROGRAMS WHAT HAD NOT BEEN EFFECTIVE AT IMPROVING REHABILITATION AND RECIDIVISM OUTCOMES FOR OFFENDERS -- THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BE INCREASING THE SIZE OF THESE PROGRAMS AND WHILE I WOULD CHANGE THE CURRICULUM AND INCREASED PAIN QUALIFICATIONS. FOR THE CONTRACT SOUTH OF THE PROVIDING THE SERVICES IT DOES NOT INCLUDE SUFFICIENT OVERSIGHT FROM THE DEPARTMENT TO ENSURE THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE IMPLEMENTED APPROPRIATELY. IN ADDITION THE PROPOSAL NOTES THAT SOME OF THE STAFF MEMBERS HAVE. BEEN BRINGING IN CONTRABAND AND DRUGS INTO THE FACILITIES AND BY INCREASING THE STUFF IT COULD ACTUALLY BE TWO MORE CONTRABAND AND TRYING TO FACILITIES. I SUCH -- DUTIES CAM SO UNTRUE I COMMEND THIS IS EMPLOYMENT ON A PILOT BASIS -- WE AND WE RECOMMEND DOING SO AT THE THREE FACILITIES AT CURRENTLY HAVE ANY T. PROGRAMS IN PLACE AND EXPAND FROM THAT OUR WE ALSO RECOMMENDED THE PILOT INCLUDE OVERSIGHT TO ENSURE THAT CONTRACTORS FOLLOW -- THAT BEST PRACTICES FOR THESE PROGRAMS AND THAT INDEPENDENT EVALUATION BY RESOURCES IS DONE TO DETERMINE THAT THE PROGRAM. THAT EFFECT ON SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS IN PRISON -- INMATE HEALTH AND OFFENDER OUTCOMES UPON RE ENTRY. AND ALSO INCLUDED OUTCOMES IN THE COMMUNITY SUCH AS RECIDIVISM AN OVERDOSE DEATHS. WE OUGHT ESTIMATE THAT -- PILOT OF THIS MAGNITUDE WOULD COST LESS THAN TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND WOULD BE UNLIKELY TO EXCEED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS AT FULL IMPLEMENTATION. SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE DECIDE TO IMPLEMENT A STATEWIDE AYE STD T. PROGRAM RECOMMEND MODIFYING THE PROPOSAL TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE CONCERNS -- SUCH MODIFICATIONS INCLUDE REQUIRING A MORE GRADUAL IMPLEMENTATION -- AND ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORT FROM CDC ARE AND THE RECEIVER ON THE PROGRAM'S IMPLEMENTED IMPLEMENTATION COSTS. AN INDEPENDENT EVALUATION ONCE THE PROGRAM IS FULLY IMPLEMENTED. ANOTHER ISSUE THAT I WANTED MENTIONED BECAUSE THERE WAS BROUGHT UP. ABOUT OVERDOSE DEATHS IN THE PRISONS THERE ARE ABOUT FOURTY OVERDOSE DEATHS THAT LOST YOUR FRONT. IN THE PRESENCE OF SOME OF THOSE WAR OVERDOSE WHICH WOULD LEAD TO OPIOIDS -- HOW WE NOTE THAT THIS PROPOSAL ASSUMES THAT A COULD BE A 50% UP TAKE GREAT -- SET MEANING THAT 50% OF INDIVIDUALS WHICH USED TO TAKE MEDICATION ASSIST TREATMENT AND 50% WOULD NOT GO INTO IT. IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ACTUALLY REDUCE OVERDOSE DEATHS AS A RESULT. WITHIN THE PRISONS THANK YOU. MANY OF THE COMMENTS THE COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. THIS JONES SAWYER. I DON'T THINK HE LIKED. TO YOU ARE RESPOND. IT OR CAN YOU SHORTEN IT WAS SO MUCH WELL I GUESS TWO THINGS THAT WAS THE THERE WAS A LOT THAT WAS APPARENTLY WRONG WITH THE PROPOSAL -- I I DID FIND IT STRIKING THE SUGGESTION THAT. BY ADDING MEDICAL PERSONNEL TO TREAT THE DISEASE WE ACTUALLY WILL MAKE THE PROGRAM WORSE BECAUSE SOME SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THEM WILL -- OF SMUGGLE IN DRUGS THIS IS LA -- REALLY SUGGESTING THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD SOLVE THE DRUG PROBLEM BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF STAFF. AT CDC ARE. THAT'S JUST NOT. ON A SERIOUS CRITICISM. I DO THINK THE PROBLEM -- WITH MOST OF WHAT -- OF THE LA -- IS SUGGESTING. COMES DOWN TO THE FOLLOWING. WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE GREATER CERTAINTY. YEAH I'D LOVE TO HAVE MORE CERTAINTY. WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE FIFTEEN OTHER STATES WHO HAVE DONE THIS BEFORE US. WELL THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE. TO ARM WOULD BE NICE. TO HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT ARE LIKELY EFFORT TO SEE WHAT IS GOING TO BE OF THIS PROGRAM YEAH. BUT IN THE MEANTIME. WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE DYING BECAUSE WE'RE NOT TREATING. AND WE HAVE THIS YEAR EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE WHO ARE HAVING OVER GOES. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH. WE START OUT WITH ANOTHER PILOT. WE'RE NOT GONNA BE DONE DOING SMALL PILOTS THAT REALLY DON'T ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. FOR WHAT FIVE SEVEN EIGHT YEARS. WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM NOW. IT'S A BIG. PROJECT A BIG INITIATIVE. THERE ARE BIG RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH IT. BUT I THINK CDC ARE HAS SHOWN OVER THE PAST DECADE. THAT WE CAN DO BIG THINGS. WE CAN IMPLEMENT LARGE RIGHT T. SYSTEMS SONGS THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD. WE CAN WOULD COMPLETELY REMAKE HEALTH CARE. WE CAN DO TO HELP SEE PROGRAM. BUT TREATING THOUSANDS OF INMATES. SO -- I AM ASKING ON THE ADMINISTRATION I THINK IS ASKING FOR SOME TRUST AND CONFIDENCE THAT WE REALIZE THERE ARE RISKS HERE. BUT WE'RE GONNA BE WATCHING VERY CLOSELY. UP TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROGRAM GETS IMPLEMENTED. OUT CORRECTLY. WHAT I MAY WANT TO SUGGEST THAT WE HAVE A A COLLEAGUE -- WHO HAS BEEN ADVOCATING FOR NEEDLE EXCHANGE WITH A COLLEAGUE FROM STOCKTON? ON THAT I WAS VERY SKEPTICAL ABOUT AND AND I I MAY HAVE SAID SOME DISPARAGING THINGS ABOUT.% HER PROGRAM AND AND THAT THE STATE IS SANCTIONING. PEOPLE TO GO AHEAD BASICALLY GET STATE GET HIGH CENTERS. AND ONCE SHE FULLY EXPLAIN HOW IT WORKED ONCE SHE FULLY EXPLAINED ABOUT THE DIFFERENT RESOURCES THAT WOULD BE. IN THESE DIFFERENT PLACES -- THAT WOULD GET PEOPLE OFF THE DRUGS. ONCE I WENT TO ONE OF THOSE CENTERS IN AND SAW IT WAS EXPERIMENTAL NAME YOU HAVE TO GO OUT OF THE COUNTRY TO SEE. WHERE SOMEBODY'S NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS WORK -- ONCE I ACTUALLY SAW. AND SAW IT ACTUALLY DID WAS REALLY MORE OF A DRUG REHABILITATION PROGRAM THAT HAPPENED TO PROVIDE. NEIL CHANGE TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM KILLING THEMSELVES. YEAH I TOLD YOU NEED TO SAY IT BACKWARDS. NOT THE RIGHT WAY. AND AND TALK ABOUT THAT BUT THE TALK ABOUT HOW YOU'RE GOING TO TREAT PEOPLE HOW SUCCESSFUL IS GOING TO BE SOME MY RECOMMENDATION IN IN AN OPENING. THE LIMITED TIME THAT -- YOU CAN ACTUALLY MAYBE INVITE. THE LA -- TO COME OVER AND SEE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO OR ART OR SIT DOWN AND FULLY EXPLAIN -- THE THE ENTIRE. TEA UP THE PROGRAM -- AND HOW IT HAS AN IMPACT ON ON WHAT YOU WANNA DO IS IT IS IT NEW. IS IT BEYOND OUR COMPREHENSION AND THINGS. YEAH BUT WE WE WE CAN GET OVER THAT. YOU KNOW I REMEMBER SEEN STAR TRAKS A WOULD NEVER HAVE. FLIP PHONES AND WE WERE BEYOND FLIP FLIP PHONES HAPPEN WITH. IT SO I I WOULD SUGGEST AS THE NEW TECHNOLOGY NEW TREATMENT WAYS OF TREATMENT THAT. THE SPINDLE MORE TIME -- TALKING ONLY. TO OUR MEMBERS AFTER EVALUATION PROGRAM BUT ALSO MEMBERS HERE THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT. GARY OTHER COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. OF ONE OF THE I GUESS ONE OF THE CONCERNS AND AND AS THIS IS THE AND WILL BE LOOKING AT THIS IS A VERY LARGE. PROPOSAL AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IMPLEMENTING OF ARE YOU A PROGRAM -- THAT THE I KNOW ONE OF THEM HAD SOME DIFFICULTY WITH SUCCESS SO I THINK THE COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR PROGRAM ONE OF OUR STATE AUDITOR'S CONCLUDED THAT -- IT REALLY WAS NOT OF WAS NOT WE WERE BASICALLY DOING MUCH IN TERMS OF RECIDIVISMIN TERMS OF PEOPLE IN THE PROGRAM GETTING OUT AND NOT BEING A BEING ABLE TO STAY OUT -- HAVE YOU DRESS THAT SSUE OR IS THAT GOING TO BE ADDRESSED THAT'S ONE OF THE CONCERNS WITH THE PROGRAM TO HIS. THIS THING IS SO LARGE AND WE'RE ROLLING IT OUT EVERYWHERE RATHER THAN IN. PHASES OR SOMETHING AND ALONG THE WAY THERE'S BEEN SOME DIFFICULTY IN TERMS OF OF THE PROGRAM ITSELF BEING EFFECTIVE SO THE QUESTION IS HOW ARE WE ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. SUFFICIENTLY TO SAY IT'S NOW WE CAN GO PRIME TIME YOU KNOW TEMP THE PROGRAM ITSELF. A GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS A RAINS IS A DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE DIVISION OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS -- TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I THINK THIS PROPOSAL FINALIZES ALL OF THOSE ISSUES THAT WE HAD SEEN PREVIOUSLY IN TERMS OF EVERYTHING FROM THE BEGINNING ASSESSMENTS AND GETTING PEOPLE INTO PROGRAM. BY HAVING US CONNECT WITH MEDICAL AND HAVE THAT REFERRAL COME DIRECTLY FROM MEDICAL THROUGH THAT ASSESSMENT PROCESS REALLY GETTING PEOPLE INTO PROGRAM WHEN THEY NEED TO BE THERE AS PART OF THEIR CLINICAL CARE -- WE HAD INCONSISTENT AND DISCONNECTED COMPONENTS WE SAT DOWN WITH EXPERTS AND MEDICAL TO DEVELOP A CURRICULUM THAT IS BOTH IN PLACE CONSISTENTLY DELIVERED ACROSS THIRTY FIVE INSTITUTIONS AND DO IT DOING THAT CONSISTENTLY AND CONCURRENTLY. SO THE PEOPLE ARE ASSESSING THAT TREATMENT AND THEN SOME OTHER THINGS ABOUT CURRICULUM VARIETY INFIDELITY WE HAD MASSIVE CURRICULUMS ALL OVER THIRTY FIVE INSTITUTIONS WERE PUTTING ONE IN PLACE. AND WE'RE ALSO PUTTING THE TOOLS IN PLACE THE MEDICALS BEEN LEVERAGING THROUGH THEIR DASHBOARDS WE'VE DEVELOPED WEEKLY MONTHLY DASHBOARDS TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE OPERATIONALIZE IN IT WE HAVE AN EXECUTIVE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE THAT'S GOING TO BE HELPING REVIEW TO MAKE SURE THINGS ARE HAPPENING -- APPROPRIATELY AND ACCORDING TO TIME LINES AND DEAR P. IS VERY WELL VERSED IN -- DOING STATE WIDE EXPANSES ACROSS THIRTY FIVE INSTITUTIONS WE DO THAT CONTRACTUALLY NOW SO I THINK EVERYTHING THAT WE PUT IN PLACE IN TERMS OF FOUNDATIONAL OVERSIGHT -- AND THEN OUR INCLUSION WITH MEDICAL AND MAKING THIS MODEL WORK TOGETHER -- AND INCLUDING THE REENTRY RESOURCES REALLY SOLIDIFIES A PROGRAM THAT CREATES A CONNECTION FROM IN PRISON ALL THE WAY TO THE COMMUNITY AND THAT'S REALLY -- THE CRITICAL COMPONENT HERE. OKAY THEIR COMMENTS. QUESTIONS WITH SYSTEM YES. POLICIES AS I LOOK AT THIS WHAT WHAT STRIKES ME IS. THAT A LOT OF THIS IS WHAT% CITIES ARE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING ALL ALONG. SO THE FACT THAT YOU'RE COMING AND ASKING FOR MONEY NOW FOR SOMETHING THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN BUILT IN REALLY. BUT I UNDERSTAND SORT OF WHERE WE'VE COME AND WHERE WE'RE GOING. TO ME THIS IS ONE OF THESE INVESTMENTS THAT WE NEED TO BE MAKING IF WE'RE GOING TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT CLEANING WAS IF YOU LOOK AT WHY PEOPLE ARE PRESENT. A LOT OF IT IS DRUG RELATED A LOT OF IT IS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE. PROGRAMS ENOUGH PROGRAMS OUT IN OUR COMMUNITIES TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES TO KEEP PEOPLE OUT OF PRISON. SO THIS INVESTMENT IT PROBABLY MAKES SENSE HERE BUT THIS AND THAT'S WHAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE REPLICATED. IN OUR COMMUNITY SO THAT WE SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS BEFORE IT BECOMES A PROBLEM. THAT CDC OUR NEEDS TO TAKE ON ON ITS OWN. SO I'M HOPING THIS COMMITTEE WITH IT WILL TAKE THIS ASK VERY SERIOUSLY AND REALLY LOOK AT THE DEPENDENCY ISSUES AND PROVIDE THAT THAT MECHANISM FOR GETTING PEOPLE OUT OF THE PROBLEMS THAT GOT THEM INTO PRISON THE FIRST PLACE. THAT'S THE REHABILITATIVE PIECE THAT HAS LONG BEEN MISSING. SO I KNOW IT'S A BIG OF EXPENSE I KNOW IT'S A BIG ASK. WHETHER IT'S EXACTLY RIGHT HARD TO TELL I DON'T KNOW YOU WILL GET THIS IS ONLY WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO EXPERIMENT AND I WOULD HOPE WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT TO HAVE FIFTEEN OTHER STATES DO SOMETHING BEFORE. WE CAN STEP IN AND IT IT REALLY SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE OTHER STATES ALSO DON'T HAVE THE SAME LEVEL OF INCARCERATION THAT WE DO OTHER STATES. THAT DON'T HAVE HAVEN'T REALLY CREATED THIS LARGE MASS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET OURSELVES OUT FROM UNDERNEATH. SO WHETHER THIS IS RIGHT OR NOT I DON'T KNOW BUT I THINK WE SHOULD BE WILLING TO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE INVESTING AND THEN PROVIDING OVERSIGHT AND GETTING FEEDBACK BACK. ABOUT HOW THE PROGRAM'S WORKING. SO THAT CAN BE INGESTED ALONG THE WAY AND WE SHOULD BE HOLDING CITIES HERE ACCOUNTABLE TO TO RESULTS. OUT OF A PROGRAM LIKE THIS IF WE'RE GOING TO MAKE AN INVESTMENT THAT'S THIS SUBSTANTIAL BUT I WOULD HOPE THIS COMMITTEE. WOULD DEFINITELY TAKE UP. A PROPOSAL LIKE THIS SERIOUSLY AND OF COURSE WORKING WITH THE SENATE AND WITH THE ADMINISTRATION BUT WHAT WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE BUILDING IN HERE IS ENOUGH. ABILITY TO GET DATA BACK AND REALLY. SHOW SOME RESULTS BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE PAST FOR US TO IN THE LONG RUN REDUCE THE PRISON POPULATIONS AND REDUCE. THE AMOUNT OF OF THE DRUG THE SITUATION THAT WE'RE FINDING IN OUR COMMUNITIES. SO. I GUESS THAT'S MIGHT THE ONES THAT I LOOK AT THIS I LOOK AT IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN BEING DONE. ALL ALONG ANYWAY BUT IF WE'RE GETTING AROUND TO DOING THIS NOW DOING IT APPROPRIATELY. LET'S DO IT BUT LET'S DO IT RIGHT. OKAY. GIVE ME THE COMMENTS THE COMMENTS FROM THE AUDIENCE. DIVISION A MINUTE WHEN ORGANIZATION. AND YOUR POSITION. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS HAULING MICHON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA SUSPICION OF ALCOHOL AND DRUG PROGRAM EXECUTIVES FOR THE STATEWIDE ASSOCIATION THAT PROVIDES SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT SERVICES -- IN THE COMMUNITY AT THREE HUNDRED SITES THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- AND MANY OF OUR PROGRAMS OPERATE BOTH THE IMPRISONED AND POST RELEASED COMMUNITY TREATMENT PROGRAMS -- AND I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT CAT PEE GENERALLY SUPPORTS. THIS PROPOSAL WE HAVE LONG ADVOCATED -- FOR THE INSTITUTION OF MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT IN PRISON SO WE ARE -- PLEASED TO SEE THAT -- THAT IT IS NOW -- BEING -- OF INSTITUTED ON A AB PRISON WIDE BASIS -- WE HAVE A SUBMITTED. TO THE COMMITTEE AND TO A C. D. C. A. R. -- OUR RECOMMENDATIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE PROPOSAL THAT HAS BEEN MADE. BEEN SUBMITTED. END OF PARTICULARLY THE AREAS OF BETWEEN -- THE IN CUSTODY TREATMENT SUCH ISSUES TREATMENT AND THE MEDICAL AND TO STRENGTHEN THAT RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE THE MEDICATION ALONE DOESN'T GET TO THE TREATMENT IT ALSO NEED THE COUNSELING AND THE OTHER PARTS OF IT SO -- IS SPECIFICALLY THE SUBSTANCE USE COUNSELING -- SO WE WE HAVE -- ARE INTERESTED IN WORKING WITH COLLABORATIVELY WITH BOTH THE CDC ARE AND THE RECEIVER IN STRENGTHENING. THAT KIND OF RELATIONSHIP SO THAT -- THAT TREATMENT SERVICES ARE SEAMLESS NOT ONLY BETWEEN MEDICAL AND THE OTHER PERSON BUT ALSO PRISON SERVICES. BUT ALSO BETWEEN IN CUSTODY AND TRANSITION OUT TO THE COMMUNITY -- KID THEN YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YES AND THEN THE REST OF IT WE'VE SUBMITTED THE ONE THE ONE THING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THE COMMITTEES TIME TO TALK ABOUT IS. THE REAL NEED FOR IT INCREASING THE UP OPPOSED TO RELEASE SERVICES -- THE MOST. PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING RELEASED THE MOST CRITICAL TIME IN THEIR MOST AT RISK TIME FOR RECIDIVISM IS. A THIRTY TO NINETY DAYS AFTER RELEASE AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS A SERVICES IN FUNDING TO PROVIDE NAVIGATION TO GET PEOPLE TO THE RIGHT SERVICES FOR THE RIGHT LEVEL OF TREATMENT THAT THEY NEED -- BUT WE WOULD ADVOCATE FOR THAT ALSO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER COMMENTS. OKAY FINE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT ITEM WAS ALSO HELD OPEN -- I THINK WE HEAR THAT -- THIS IS A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE WITH AN AWFUL LOT OF FUNDING BEING PUT INTO IT SO HOPE IF IF WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT HOPEFULLY THERE IS SOME. IN FROM STEPS TO REPORTING BACK TO MAKE SURE WE'RE HEADING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND IN THAT SOMEWHERE. A LOT OF MONEY SPENT AND NOT THE RESULTS WE WANT I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE EXTREMELY POOR THE SPECIALLY SINCE IT IS NEW AND WE HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE WITH NOT THAT MUCH EXPERIENCE WITH THE PROPOSAL -- WOULD NOT -- ISSUE NUMBER SIX WHICH IS THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE MAY REVISION PROPOSALS [inaudible] FREEZING. AS A TEAM NO LONGER FITS INTO. THE TWO OF THEM [inaudible] OKAY YEAH -- GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ARTS WANTS SOME THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF CDC OURS OFFICE OF FISCAL SERVICES. IN THE INTEREST OF TIME WE'RE GONNA. I KNOW THE AGENDA KIND OF COMBINES TWO ISSUES SO THAT'S OKAY WILL INTRODUCE BOTH OF THEM AT ONCE HERE -- THE DEPARTMENT IS PROPOSING AN INCREASE OF ONE POINT TWO MILLION AND EIGHT POINT 8% OF POSITIONS TO FACILITATE PROPOSED. REORGANIZATION OF THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION TO THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE AGENCY. THE SECOND PROPOSAL. IS A PROPOSAL. TO IS A JOINT ONE ACTUALLY WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS OF CORPS IT INCLUDES TWO POINT FOUR POSITIONS AT DJJ. AN ASSOCIATE GENERAL FUND TOTALING THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR THOUSAND THE CCC OR CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS REQUEST TO PROGRAM SUPPORTS STAFF POSITIONS AND ONE POINT ONE MILLION ONE TIME. AND FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND ONGOING GENERAL FUND BEGINNING IN. TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DJJ APPRENTICES CONSERVATION CORPS PILOT PROGRAM. AND HERE WITH ME TODAY IS BOTH THE DIRECTOR AND THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE. CHUCK SUPPLE AND HEATHER BOWLS. THANK YOU. YES ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- DOCTOR WEBER IN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I GIVE YOU AN OVERVIEW OF THE OF THE TWO PROPOSALS ONE THE REQUEST FOR SUPPORT FOR THE INITIATION OF THE TRANSITION. OF DJJ FROM THE ADULT PRISON SYSTEM -- TO THE TO BE NAMED DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION -- IS BASICALLY TO ALLOW US TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OF SETTING UP THE REALLY ONE OF THE HALLMARKS OF THIS TRANSITION AND THAT'S THE TRAINING DEVELOPMENT CENTER TO BEGIN DEVELOPING -- TRAINING COMPONENT THAT TRAINS NOT ONLY THE INDIVIDUALS AND STAFF WHO WERE INCOMING THE NEW RECRUITS THAT WOULD BE -- WORKING DIRECTLY WITH THE YOUTH BUT WHAT WE DESCRIBE AS THE WHOLE MISSION FORCES AS A TRAINING CENTER FOR STAFF YOUTH -- VOLUNTEERS FAMILY MEMBERS AS WELL SO THAT EVERYBODY IS TRAIN SUPPORTED ON HOW TO REINFORCE THE INTERVENTIONS THE WE HAVE HOW TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH YOUTH AND ALL TO BE ABLE -- TO PLATE KRIPKE A CRITICAL ROLES IN FULFILLING OUR MISSION AND THE IN ADDITION THERE ARE POSITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS REQUEST THAT ALLOWS US TO BEGIN TO BRING ON THE LEADERSHIP TO ESTABLISH SIGNIFICANT DIVISIONS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT ONE OBVIOUSLY. HAS TO DO WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE DEPARTMENT -- AS WELL AS ONE THAT WOULD OVERSEE WHAT WE CALL THE STRENGTH BASED SPACE THE POSITIVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT ASPECT WHICH IS. CONCENTRATING ON BUILDING UP THE ASSETS OF THE YOUTH PARTICULARLY OVERSEEN -- KATE THE HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION COLLEGE EDUCATION -- THE C. T. E. PROGRAMMING AS WELL AS BRINGING IN VOLUNTEERS A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS BE ABLE TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUTH -- THEY'RE GONNA TRANSCEND FROM OUR FACILITIES DIRECTLY INTO COMMUNITIES TO ASSIST WITH THEIR SUCCESSFUL RE ENTRY INTO THE COMMUNITY AND FULFILLING. HONORABLE DISCHARGE. IN THE SECOND A REQUEST -- IT HAS TO DO WITH A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS AND LOCAL CONSERVATION COURSE AND THIS IS SOMETHING WHICH WE CONSIDER TO BE A NEEDING TO TO RIDE THE BICYCLE IS WILL BUT AS WE ARE BUILDING THAT SO TO SPEAK TO BE ABLE TO BEGIN TO DELIVER ON THE PROMISE. OF THE DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION BY SHOWING THE POWER OF PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS TO BE ABLE TO FULFILL OUR MISSION. AND IN THIS CASE IT'S WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS AS WELL AS WITH THE LOCAL CONSERVATION CORES WE HAVE FOUND THAT -- IT IN BEFORE FOR YOUTH PLACEMENT IN A CORE UPON RE ENTRY IS SOMETHING THAT IT MAKES SENSE IT'S VALUABLE IT REINFORCES -- MUCH OF THE POSITIVE OUTCOMES SO WE'RE HOPING THEM TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE UPON RE ENTRY -- BUT TO REALLY BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM -- THIS IS A POTENTIAL PLACEMENT FOR YOUTH COMING OUT OF THE J. J. THAT WE REALLY HAVE TO CREATE THE OPPORTUNITY WITHIN DJJ THAT THEY HAVE TO START IMAGINING. EXACTLY WHAT IS A CORE WHAT'S IT MEAN TO BE A CORE MEMBER TO BE ABLE TO EXPLORE THAT NEW IDENTITY AND THEN TO BEGIN TO DEVELOP THE THAT THE PRACTICE IN THE SKILLS IN THE MINDSET ASSOCIATED WITH BEING A CORE MEMBER. SO THAT WHEN THEY LEAVE THEIR CHANCES OF BEING ABLE TO BE PLACED IN EITHER A LOCAL COR OR THE CCC. ARE -- SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED I KNOW CHALLENGES BEEN WITH THE LOCAL COURSE HAVING YOUTH OFF THE STREET BE COR READY WE HAVE A POPULATION OF YOUTH WHO HAVE TIME -- IT TO BE ABLE TO BE DEVELOPED AND PREPARED TO BE CORPS READY -- IMMEDIATELY UPON RE ENTRY TO THE COMMUNITY AND THAT'S THE TYPE OF PARTNERSHIP THE WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD AND DEMONSTRATE -- AS A PART OF THIS NEW DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION FOLLY BUT THAT IS A GENERAL OVERVIEW AND BOTH SOCCER BALLS MYSELF FOR HER. TO ANSWER QUESTIONS INTO A RESPOND MORE SPECIFICALLY TO THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. OKAY. THREE COMMENTS FROM FINANCE. HELLO. WOW OKAY. COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. YES MISTER STONE. YES AND IN IN APPRECIATE THE DIRECTION YOU'RE GOING BUT AGAIN I WANT TO UNDERSCORE THAT IF WHAT YOU FALL WE'RE DOING IS TAKING. CONCEPTS OUT OF DJJ AND DROPPING THEM INTO THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES WORLD. WE POTENTIALLY MISS A REAL OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SERVE. KIDS WHO ARE STRUGGLING AND KIDS WHO NEED OUR HELP KIDS WHO ARE AT PROMISED USE MINE FROM COLLEAGUES TERM. AND AND REALLY LOOK AT AT WHAT THEY NEED AND SO WITH SOME OF THE LANGUAGE AND SOME OF THE THE CONCEPT IF WE'RE IF WE'RE REALLY NOT BUILDING IN THERAPEUTIC REHABILITATIVE MODELS AND ALL. AND STILL HANGING KIDS IS BEING. THE YOU KNOW THE BAD KIDS THAT MAYBE THERE'S SOME REDEMPTION AS OPPOSED TO KIDS WHO REALLY STRUGGLE KIDS WHO OF WHO HAVE. BEEN TRAUMATIZED AND GONE TO ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES AND THAT'S WHERE THE THE THE REASON THAT THAT I WOULD HOPE WE WERE BRING THEM. INTO THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES WORLD. AND SO ONCE THAT HAVING A A MORE COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM WHICH IS NOT NECESSARILY YOUR ROLE IN THIS BUT OF A PIECE OF IT BUT I'M HOPING THE ADMINISTRATION WILL GO FURTHER. IN DESIGNING A PROGRAM THAT ADDRESSES ISSUES THAT KIDS NEED IN ORDER. TO TO NOT BE IN TROUBLE THE FIRST PLACE TO GET OUT OF TROUBLE. TO BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT THEY DID ABSOLUTELY BUT A DRESS THE UNDERLYING ISSUES THAT THEY HAVE THAT GOT THEM IN THAT SITUATION IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND THAT'S YOU'RE TAKING KIDS WHO HAVE MADE THAT MISTAKE AND NOW. WE'RE REHABILITATING THEM. IN HOPEFULLY THE BEST OF WAYS BUT WE SHOULD ALSO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF KIDS WHO ARE. STRUGGLING IN THEIR COMMUNITY STRUGGLING WITH AND THEIR FAMILIES. AND AND BE ABLE TO WRAP SERVICES AROUND THEM SO THAT THEY DON'T END UP IN. IN SITUATIONS WHERE THEY ARE IN TROUBLE SO. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE WE GLOBALLY AND AND YOUR ROLE THIS SPECIFIC TO THE KIDS WHO ARE JUVENILE JUSTICE AND AND COMING OUT OF THAT BUT TO THE EXTENT WE STILL. TREAT THOSE KIDS DIFFERENTLY AT AND CATEGORIZE THEM DIFFERENTLY THAN I THINK WE'RE NOT SERVING A BROADER MISSION THAT WE POSSIBLY CLICK HERE. SO I HOPE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION. LOOKS BEYOND WHAT THIS SPECIFIC PROPOSAL IS A LOOK AT THE OPPORTUNITY BE ABLE CIRCUITS BETTER. IN ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES WHETHER OR NOT THEY COME INTO. THE PURVIEW OF OF THE STRUCTURE THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION BEFORE I JUST WANTED TO GO. BACK ON THE RECORD FOR THAT BECAUSE I I THINK WE'RE REALLY ON THE CUSP OF SOMETHING THAT IS. SIGNIFICANT AND CAN BE TREMENDOUSLY HELPFUL. BUT I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT THE ENTIRE POPULATION THAT'S THERE NOT JUST KIDS HAVE DONE SOMETHING WRONG. AND GOT WRAPPED UP IN THAT BUT ALSO KIDS WHO ARE. WHO NEED US TO STAND UP FOR THEM AND AND GET A BETTER LEVEL OF SERVICES I KEEP HOPING THAT THIS CONVERSATION WILL BROUGHT? AS WE GO THROUGH THIS INTO BEING ABLE TO REALLY PROVIDE A COMMON SET OF SERVICES FOR ALL KIDS WHO ARE SIMILARLY SITUATED IN NEED US TO HELP THEM. WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND WITHIN THEIR FAMILIES THRIVE AND INTO MUCH BETTER SO THAT WE DON'T END UP HAVING. TO RESTORE THEM WE DON'T END UP HAVING -- TO THE TOW HAVE THEM ATONE FOR THE MISTAKES THAT THEY MADE BUT I DO WE NOT MAKE THE MISTAKES. IN THE FIRST PLACE WILL BE ASSISTED OUT OF THAT SO I THIS IS THIS IS INTERESTING WILL WILL ABSOLUTELY SEE WHERE THIS GUY WAS AND THEY HAD. ONE THAT I'M HOPING THE LEGISLATURE WILL BE. SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BUT THERE'S A LOT MORE TO DO HERE THAT I THINK ARE JUST. LOOKING AT THIS -- FIRST BLUSH. COMMENTS IN THE AUDIENCE ELEVEN FROM WELL I'M SORRY. JONES SAWYER. AND I AND I HAVE A CONCERN TO ANNA AND I HOPE -- BECAUSE I READ THIS IS THIS KIND OF HAS THE SAME CHALLENGE I HAD. WITH THE THIRTY SEVEN MILLION. THAT I GOT. FOR FOR ACES TRUMP FORM CARE THE BUREAUCRACY. IN THEIR MYOPIC VIEW OF HOW YOU DEAL WITH YOUNG PEOPLE CAN'T GET OUT OF THEIR WAY. AND THIS KIND OF SOUNDS LIKE THAT AT THE YOU KNOW I AND I HOPE YOU'RE NOT WEDDED TO THIS. CRADDICK DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION BECAUSE THAT KIND OF CAPS LATE WHAT THE PROBLEM IS. AND EVEN AS I READ THROUGH HERE -- SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING I DON'T KNOW WHAT. THE HECK THAT MEANS BUT I DO KNOW WHEN I'VE TALKED TO FORMALLY INCARCERATED. AND INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS THEY TALK ABOUT TRAUMA. GET THE EXPERIENCE WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG YOUNGER. AND AND HOW THAT LED THEM INTO THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE AND THAT THERE WASN'T ANYONE THERE THAT DEALT WITH THAT TRAUMA AND IF THEY HAD SOMEONE JUST DEALING WITH THE TRAUMA ALONE. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A HUGE HELP IN THE BE ABLE. TO READ EFFECTIVELY BEEN REDUCED RATE LEVEL TO BE ABLE TO DO MATH AND OTHER SKILLS THAT WE JUST KIND OF TAKE FOR GRANTED. AND I THINK WE NEED TO REALLY DELVE INTO. THE PSYCHE OF WHAT GETS ME TOO YOUNG PEOPLE IN A BECAUSE WE KEEP IGNORING IT. ALL OF THESE BASIC PROGRAMS WON'T MEAN ANYTHING -- AND EVEN SOME OF THEM YOU KNOW FIRST AID AND CPR CUSTOMER SERVICE LEVEL TRAINING. OSHA TRAINING -- I I DIDN'T. I DON'T SEE ANYTHING. WHERE WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT MAYBE EVEN GETTING THEM TO COLLEGE OR TRYING TO GET THEM INTO A? BUT A REAL TRADE OR EVEN TRYING TO GET THEM INTO THE COMPUTER ENGINE SO WHERE LEARNING CODING. SO THEY CAN GOAL OF IT BEYOND JUST. SUPERFICIAL MENIAL BANKS AND PASSED AND SO -- I'M I'M HOPING THAT. YOU KNOW IF YOU IF YOU NEED MISTER STONE IN MY HELP WE CAN WE CALL SOME NAMES OF THE DEPARTMENT. I THINK WILL BE A LITTLE MORE. UPLIFTING. AND DOESN'T FEEL LIKE YOU MOVE ME FROM THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM INTO ANOTHER JUSTICE SYSTEM. BUT YOU'RE ACTUALLY PUTTING IN A PLACE WHERE AS THE TERM I'M TRYING TO USE NOW THAT IS THAT PROMISED THAT YOU. LIKE HERE. AND MOVING UP AND I KNOW YOUR YOUR HEART'S IN THE RIGHT PLACE I KNOW YOU WANT TO GET THERE AND AND IF YOU NEED US. HERE TO BREAK THE CHAINS OF THE BUREAUCRACY WERE WILLING TO HELP YOU WITH THAT BECAUSE I ALSO KNOW -- YOU PROBABLY HAVE SOME INNOVATIVE IDEAS OF THINGS THAT YOU WANT TO DO. BUT YOU MIGHT BE CONSTRAINED TO YOU PROBABLY CAN'T TELL ME NOW YOU TELL ME LATER WHEN NOBODY IS LISTENING -- I WOULD SAY ANYTHING TO ANYBODY I PROMISE. OF HOW YOU WOULD WANT TO EXPAND THIS. IN A WAY THAT NIGHT I THINK YOU PROBABLY WOULD BELIEVE WOULD BE -- MORE BENEFICIAL TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF THAT. MAYBE THE TRADITIONAL OF BUREAUCRACY JUST CAN'T. SEEING THEIR WAY TO APPROVING IT REMAIN FUNDED -- BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS TO THE NEXT LEVEL WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SO -- SIMULATOR. OKAY ANY OTHER COMMENTS TO MAKE ANY OF COME FROM THE AUDIENCE ANY. JUST GIVE US YOUR NAME AND AGENCY AND WHETHER YOU'RE IN FAVOR OF OPPOSED TO IT. YES -- WORKING CONVENE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL CONSERVATION CORPS IS IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS THANK YOU THANK YOU. HELLO MATEO AND SEIU LOCAL ONE THOUSAND ONE IN SUPPORT OF THIS TO AND IN FACT. WE'VE SPOKEN -- TO MISTER SUPPLE AND TWO CD C. R. ABOUT THEIR ABOUT -- THIRTEEN THOUSAND PRISONERS WITHIN CDC ARE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE WHO MIGHT REALLY BENEFIT FROM THIS SORT OF REHABILITATIVE THERAPEUTIC ENVIRONMENT THAT WE'RE CREATING IN DJJ A LOT MORE THAN IT'S YOU SEE ARE. SO WE'RE HOPING THAT WE CAN KEEP THAT PATHWAY OPEN WE CAN MOVE SOME OF THOSE PRISONERS WHO ARE. UNDER AGE TWENTY FIVE INTO THIS REHABILITATIVE ENVIRONMENT AS PART OF THIS PROCESS THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE -- IT I I I WANT TO SAY THAT I THINK -- THESE PROPOSALS -- WHICH IS GOOD OF OBVIOUSLY WITHOUT WITH THE SUPPORT OF FINANCE IN LA -- THE CONTROVERSY IS NOT THERE IN TERMS OF WHERE THE MONEY IS AND HOW WE USE IT IN WITH HIS GETS AS WERE IT YOU GUYS ON THE SAME PAGE AND BE COMMENDED. I LET'S SAY BOTH OF YOUR WRONG THOUGH SO THAT MAKES ME FEEL BETTER BUT NO I'M JUST TEASING BUT I AM CONCERNED HOWEVER THOUGH THAT. WHEN THIS PROPOSAL CAME FORWARD BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WE WORKED ON SO MANY ISSUES BEFORE -- WITH THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO IMPROVE AND WHAT HAVE YOU. THAT -- I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT WE SAID WE WANTED DIFFERENT SYSTEM. ONE A SYSTEM THAT IS -- THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN THE CURRENT SYSTEM AND WE'VE BEEN PROMISED AT THAT -- THAT WE ARE COMMITTED TO ENDING THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM AS WE KNOW WHAT ONCE AND FOR ALL THOSE ARE THE WORDS OF OUR GOVERNOR AND THAT'S A REALLY GOOD STATEMENT. THAT'S THERE I THINK IT TAKES A LOT MORE TIME TO DO THAN WHAT WE'VE HAD TO DO IN TERMS OF TIME TO DO IT -- I AM CONCERNED AS SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES TO MENTION. THAT -- I DON'T WANT TO BE THIS TO BE THE LATEST AND GREATEST BY AT THAT WE DO. AND WE DID IT WITH THE SAME RESULTS BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE DONE IS MOVE FROM YOU KNOW A ROOM THAT'S NOW BROWN AND TURNED IT INTO A ROOM THAT'S PINK OR GREATER ORANGE OR SOMETHING. IN THAT SENSE THAT WE HAVE BEEN LATCHED ON TO THINGS THAT ARE OUT THERE WITHOUT REALLY CAREFULLY ANALYZING WHAT WE'RE DOING. I DON'T HAVE A VISION AT THIS POINT AND I'M AND I DON'T STILL DON'T SEE A VISION OTHER THAN WORDS BUT I DON'T REALLY SEE. A CLEAR VISION OF WHERE WE'RE GOING WITH THIS WHAT IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE -- WE HAD SOME OF THE ADVOCATES COME IN BEFORE AND THEY'VE TALKED ABOUT. A NUMBER OF THINGS AND THEY ARE UP TO THEY ARE BASED AT ONE POINT OPTIMISTIC AND SKEPTICAL AT THE SAME TIME BECAUSE I THINK THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH LIKE MOST FOLKS HAVE. A WHOLE LOT OF DIFFERENT CHANGES YOU KNOW COMES IN AND YOU'RE GOING TO DO THIS FOR US IS THAT AND YOU CHANGE THE BUILDING. IN TERMS OF MEN NOT MAKING LOOKS SO MUCH LIKE A PRISON OR YOU CHANGE THIS YOU. THAT AND IN THE END THE RESULTS OF THE SAME STILL NOT MEETING THE NEEDS OF KIDS WERE STILL SEEING HIGH LEVEL OF RECIDIVISM WE'RE STILL SEEING A JUVENILE JUSTICE PROGRAM BASICALLY BEING THE PIPELINE TO THE HARDCORE PRISONS OR WHATEVER MAYBE. SO I'M LOOKING. FOR A PLAN OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO I'M NOT SURE WE'VE MENTIONED WE WANT TO USE OUR ADVOCATES WE WANT. TO BRING THEM INTO THE PROCESS AND AND YET I DON'T SEE A WAY IN WHICH THEY'RE BEING. TRULY INCORPORATED IN THE PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION ON AN ONGOING BASIS -- IT SEEMS TO ME IF I WERE GOING -- TO CHANGE A SYSTEM AS LARGE AS THIS. AND AS IMPORTANT AS THIS. I WOULD BE PLANNING IT ON A REGULAR BASIS MORE THAN FROM JUST FROM JANUARY TO WHAT IS THIS MAY. OF MORE THAN FIVE MONTHS TO CHANGE THE WHOLE SYSTEM. I THINK THERE ARE ALSO A LOT OF THINGS THAT -- THE THAT I'VE SEEN IN TERMS OF THE JUVENILE SYSTEMS THAT HAVE BEEN -- THAT HAVE TAKEN TIME IN TERMS OF TRANSFORMATION NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF OF WHAT OUR VISION IS WHAT THE KIDS SHOULD BE DOING WHAT IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE. BUT ALSO WHO SHOULD BE DOING IT. YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT THOSE THERE'S A WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE THERE'S A BIG PUSH TO SIMPLY SHIFT THE CURRENT EMPLOYEES INTO THE CURRENT SYSTEM TO THE NEW SYSTEM. AND MOVE ON FROM THERE AND THAT COULD BE THE WORST THING IF WE BUILT A SYSTEM AROUND CURRENT EMPLOYEES NOT THAT CORN EMPLOYEES ARE BAD BUT WHEN YOU SOMETIMES CHANGING THE SYSTEM. THE RECOGNITION COMES REAL SOON IS THAT. CAN THESE FOLKS ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT A NEW SYSTEM THAT THEY ARE SO COMMITTED TO THE OLD SYSTEM ABOUT DOING. AND AND IS IT JUST WINDOW DRESSING WAS IT REALLY SUBSTANTIVE IN TERMS OF CHANGE SO. I YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT OUR RECOMMENDATION IS GOING TO BE BUT I CAN ENVISION SOMETHING THAT HAS MORE OF AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT WORKS ON THIS PROBLEM FOR US. IT REALLY GETS US TO DO IT RIGHT BECAUSE I THINK WHAT HAPPENS IF WE DON'T DO IT RIGHT. THEN WE COMMIT OURSELVES FOR WHATEVER CRAZY REASON THE WAY WE FEEL. TO DOING IT AS TO THE LEVEL WAS YOU YOU PROBABLY HER WHAT WE'VE ALREADY SPENT SO MUCH MONEY ON A PAINT IN THIS ROOM SO LET'S JUST KEEP RIGHT YOU KNOW IS UGLY BUT WE LIKE IT ANYWAY BECAUSE WE ALWAYS BEEN OUR MONEY ON IT. SO YOU DON'T HAVE BEEN. YOU KNOW BETTER THAN STEPPING BACK AND SAID I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH WE SPENT ON IT WE GOT TO MAKE SOME CHANGES AND SO. I I WANT US TO BE I'M NOT LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY VERY DEEPLY THOUGHTFUL THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT MY COLLEAGUES ARE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE ALL EXCITED ABOUT CHANGING AS WELL EXCITED ABOUT. DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT WITH OUR KIDS AND AND IT AND IT REALLY IS -- AND I'VE SEEN THINGS AS I POINTED OUT LAST TIME I I I WENT TO A JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM IN GHANA AND IT WAS SO VERY DIFFERENT THAN HERE. AND BASED ON THE VALUES OF THAT COUNTRY AND IT'S PERSPECTIVE OF YOUNG PEOPLE AND FAMILIES AND AND LOOKING AT WHAT HAD HAPPENED AS REALLY A REFLECTION. OF THEIR VALUE SYSTEM GOING AWRY YOU KNOW THAT THEY YOU KNOW THAT THEY BELIEVE THAT AT CERTAIN AT BURKE CERTAIN THINGS HAPPEN AND FROM HERE GOES TO HEAR AND GO SIT THERE. AND AND AND AND THE FAMILY PARTICIPATES IN THIS PROCESS SO WHEN THEY LOOK AT SOMETHING AS A THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN YEAR OLD. WHO'S STEALING SOMETHING OR WHATEVER THEY ARE SAYING TO THEMSELVES WE'RE IN THIS PROCESS OF WHAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO DO DID WE GO WRONG AND HOW DO WE GO BACK AND REPAIR THAT PROCESS. HOW DO WE INCORPORATE THOSE KIDS IN THE FAMILIES INTO THIS PROCESS AND SO THERE'S A SO DIFFERENT WHEN YOU WALK INTO A TO SEE A DIFFERENT PROCESS TAKING PLACE? YOU SEE A REAL DIFFERENT KIND OF REUNIFICATION IT IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF REFLECTION ON FAMILY AND PEOPLE SO. I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE FIGURE OUT WHAT WHAT WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO BE DOING IN THIS BECAUSE THIS IS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY. AND I DON'T WANT TO BE SQUANDERED BECAUSE SIMPLY WE JUST MOVE KIDS FROM. MOVE THE DESIGNATION IN OTHER WORDS THE THE THE THE NUMBERS WE HAVE WHEN WEGET PAID MAYBE YOU YOU'RE NOW IT YOU KNOW THE ONE OLE OLE SEVEN FIVE IS THE NUMBER THAT YOU HAVE NOW YOU HAVE ONE OLD. SEVEN EIGHT OKAY AND AS A RESULT NOT YOU CHECK COMES FROM THIS GROUP DOES THAT GROUP AND WE'RE DOING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER SO. I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THAT VERY MUCH SO NOT CONCERNED ABOUT YOU BUT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT HOW MUCH. THE PROCESS IS WHETHER NOW WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN THOUGHTFUL IN THE PROCESS AND WHAT WOULD HAVE ENOUGH TIME. TO BE THOUGHTFUL IN THE PROCESS AND I DON'T WANT TO MAKE. TOO MANY COMMITMENTS TOO SOON BECAUSE IF YOU DO WITHOUT THAT THEN WEEK WE'RE COMMITTED TO THAT. AND YOU KNOW HOW THAT GOES WITH THE SYSTEM GOES ON AND ON AND ON UNTIL YOU FIGURE OUT IT'S WRONG. AND THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT PROCESS BECAUSE IT INVOLVES THE LIVES OF YOUNG PEOPLE AND IS ALSO UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO ASSESS AND WE ASSESS OURSELVES. AND REALLY PUT SOMETHING IN PLACE THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL TO YOUNG PEOPLE SHOULD TAKE A LOT OF TIME. BUT I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN DO IT IN FIVE MONTHS I'VE MET YOU KNOW AND AND I THINK I'M PRETTY AWESOME. BUT BUT YOU KNOW JUST IN TERMS OF OF OF MAKING SURE THAT ALL THE FOLKS WHO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT OUR KIDS WORK. WHAT IN THE COMMUNITIES IN WHO ARE WORKING WITH THEM -- CAN CAN REALLY WRAP THEIR ARMS AROUND AND GET THIS PROCESS GOING SO THAT WAS MY CONCERN FROM THE DATE COULD POPPED OUT AND I SAID OKAY PRETTY SOON I'M GONNA SEE SOME. HUGE COMMITTEE REPORT ON ONE SEE SOME FOLKS HAS BEEN WORKING OVERTIME AT NIGHT MORNINGS AND MAYBE IT'S HERE. BUT I'M GOING TO SEE THAT AND I'M GOING TO HAVE FOLKS WHO ABOVE REALLY BITE INTO IT AND AND AND TELLING ME HOW IT'S GOING TO ROLL OUT IN PARTS AND PIECES. YOU KNOW -- SO THAT'S WEEK THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING AT AND AND I AM TOTALLY COMMITTED TO THIS CHANGE. BUT I WANTED TO BE REAL. I WANT TO BE REAL AND I DO THINK YOU DO TOO RIGHT. AT THE RISK OF RESPONDING TO NOT A QUESTIONS THAT OR EVEN TOTAL SURE DOESN'T ASK A QUESTION DON'T TALK YEAH -- AND I APPRECIATE DR WEBER WHERE YOU ARE COMING FROM -- I DO WANT TO SAY THAT I SEE THIS AS IT'S AN ONGOING JOURNEY. IS NOT THE BEGINNING OF A JOURNEY AND THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND PAST ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE INVESTED A LOT OF MONEY IN THE REFORM OF DJJ. AND THAT THERE HAVE BEEN THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF MONEY IN DEVELOPING THE INTEGRATED BEHAVIOR TREATMENT MODEL WHICH DR BOWLS WAS VERY MUCH INVOLVED WITH ALONG WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER COLLEAGUES. THAT HAS DEVELOPED. OUR CAPACITY UPON WHICH WE NEED TO BUILD TO ADDRESS THE ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES IN THE TRAUMAS IN THE ISSUES UNDERLYING -- THE BEHAVIORS THAT BROUGHT A YOUNG PERSON TO DJJ. AND THAT. THE MOVE THE PROPOSAL TO MOVE IT TO THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES IS PART OF THAT JOURNEY TO BE IN A PLACE WHERE I CAN FURTHER REINFORCING DOUBLE DOWN OUR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER THOSE SERVICES TO ADDRESS THOSE UNDERLYING NEEDS. AND THE SECOND PART OF THE JOURNEY WHICH WAS NOT PART OF THE THE PRINCIPAL PART OF THE FOR A LAWSUIT IS IS THIS NEW FRONTIER WITH REGARD TO JUVENILE JUSTICE. THE AT PROMISE YOU THE BUILDING UP UPON THE STRENGTH NEEDED TO SAY THIS IMPRESSIVE YEAH THE CUTTING EDGE THERE BECAUSE IT IS THE EXACT IT'S IT'S YOU TRIBUNE I'LL JUST IN TERMS OF SEEN YOUTH NOT AS SOMEBODY WHO. COMES IN JUST A HANDFUL OF DEFICITS BUT SOME STRENGTH BECAUSE OF ADVERSE EXPERIENCES CAN YOU KNOW SOCIAL ECONOMICAL SITUATIONS IN TERMS OF THEIR UPBRINGING. THE STRING TWENTY WILL BE BUILT UPON BUT TO BUILD UPON THEM WITHIN DJJ SO THAT THEY CAN NOT ONLY HAVE ADDRESSED REDUCE THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH BEHAVIOR BUT HAD BEGUN LIVING IMAGINE A NEW LIFE. THE PARTNERSHIPS WHICH WE HAVE REACHED OUT AND INVOLVED MANY OF THE ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS IN IN ACTUALLY DELIVERING THE SERVICES. HAS BEEN A PRINCIPAL PART OF OF SOME OF THESE OTHER PROPOSAL THAT YOU'VE SEEN AS A PART OF THE A PART OF THE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL AND SO WHAT WE HOPE TO BRING TO YOU. IS CERTAINLY A YOU KNOW DYNAMIC AND HOUSE OF ENHANCEMENT AND BUILDING UPON -- THE DISTANCE WE HAVE COME SO FAR SURE THE NEXT PART OF THAT JOURNEY AND OF COURSE WE'RE GONNA REACH OUT INVOLVED THE STAKEHOLDERS MANY OF THEM ARE ACTUALLY PROVIDING SERVICES. IN DJJ TODAY AND I THINK THAT -- A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU THAT THEY COME IN AND VISIT D. J. J. AND ARE LIKE. WOW. THIS IS A LOT DIFFERENT THAN DJJ OF THE PAST WHAT IS NOT DIFFERENT ENOUGH IN TERMS OF WHERE WE NEED TO GO AND WE THINK THAT THIS IS GOING TO ADVANCE THAT JOURNEY SIGNIFICANTLY SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO BEING ABLE TO BRING TO YOU -- THE RESULT OF THAT INPUT THE RESULT OF THAT PLANNING TO SEE THAT MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS. WELL WE'LL LOOK FORWARD TO THAT BECAUSE I THINK AS A COMMITTEE WE'RE GOING TO YOU KNOW LOOK TO SEE WHAT DATA IS BEING COLLECTED. WHAT THE RESULTS ARE WHERE YOU ARE IN THE PROCESS I THINK THAT'S THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE? YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN BASICALLY GIVEN THIS PROPOSAL IN IN JANUARY NOW HERE IT IS WE'RE GONNA MAKE THIS CHANGE. AND MOST OF US HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THE FULL BLOWN. DOCUMENT OR PLAN OR WHATEVER IT IS AND MAYBE IT IS IN ALL THESE OTHER THINGS. BUT BUT I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT I LIKE I SAID AND I THINK IT'S NOT CONTROVERSIAL IT TO THE EXTENT THAT WERE ALL IN FAVOR OF IT YOU KNOW -- OF THAT WE WANT THIS TO HAPPEN WE THINK IT CAN'T HAPPEN HAS TO HAPPEN OKAY WE'RE GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE -- AND WE'RE GOING TO BETTER BUDGET BUT NOT ONLY THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM BUT THE OVERALL DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE -- NCDC ART EVERYBODY ELSE BUT OF SO I THINK IT WILL BE IMPORTANT AT YOUR CONSULATE GIVING US INFORMATION. AW AND OUT OF ABOUT IT WE'RE GONNA PROBABLY MAYBE ASKED IT MAY EVEN HOLD A HEARING TO FIND OUT WHERE WE ARE. BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF NEXT YEAR SESSION TO GET A SENSE OF WHERE YOU ARE IN THIS PROCESS WITH THE HOLES ARE -- BECAUSE IS IT JUST THAT IMPORTANT IN IF THERE'S A NEED. FOR US TO BE MORE ENGAGED IN TERMS OF FINANCES OR THOSE KINDS OF THINGS ARE. I THINK IT WILL BE IMPORTANT SO WE'RE NOT JUST GOING TO SAY OKAY YOU GOT IT GOAL HERE'S THE MONEY HAVE A HAVE A BALL CALL US WHEN IT'S COLD GOES WRONG -- BUT HOPEFULLY WE WILL HAVE WE WILL SEE THAT ENGAGEMENT OF THE VARIOUS AGENCIES AND A COMMITMENT THAT'S THERE. AND OBVIOUSLY -- VISIT SOME OF THE FACILITIES TO MAKE SURE THINGS ARE DIFFERENT. THAN WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST BUT THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THERE IS THAT WE ALL WANT TO HAPPEN. YOU KNOW WE WANT TO HAPPEN BUT WON'T HAVE HAPPENED RIGHT. AND WE WANT TO GIVE THOSE OF YOU WHO MAKING THE CHANGE THE SUPPORT YOU NEED. TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. YOU KNOW AND SO I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT SO -- WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT IT EVEN IF WE DON'T LOOK EXCITED BUT WE REALLY ARE WERE DANCING INSIDE -- BUT BUT WE DO WANT IT DONE RIGHT AND I THINK THAT THE THE STAKES ARE HIGH. WITH REGARDS TO WHO IT'S GOING TO IMPACT AND SO I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THAT WE'VE BEEN WAITING IT MOST OF US OF LOOKING FOR SOMETHING AND WE DIDN'T SEE A WHOLE LOT COME IN -- AND SO THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT THAT WE THAT TO KEEP US IN THE LOOP. THAT WERE INVOLVED WHEN GAYS AND THAT THE STAKEHOLDERS ALSO INVOLVED IN ENGAGE BECAUSE THEY'RE SKEPTICAL THAT THEIR SUPPORT WILL BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY. OR THE ENGAGEMENT WILL BE PERMANENT OR ON GOING WITH THAT BUT AND SO I DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN I WANT THEM TO KNOW THAT THAT. IS EQUALLY INVESTED IN THIS THIS PROJECT AS WE ARE IN TERMS TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU THIS ITEM WAS HELD OPEN YOU ALSO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT BRINGS US TO ITEM NUMBER. NINE ALMOST AT THE END -- BECAUSE WE'VE DONE. SEVEN EIGHT I THINK I'LL NUMBER NINE DONNA. YEAH MAYBE VISION BUREAU OF GAMBLING ALL. OKAY -- CARD ROOMS AND THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS WORKLOAD WOW OKAY. YOU GUYS LOOK PROSPEROUS. THANK YOU MANAGER CHRIS RYAN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE -- THIS REQUEST IS FOR FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THIRTY TWO EXISTING POSITIONS. THESE POSITIONS ARE CURRENTLY SET TO EXPIRE AT THE END OF THIS FISCAL YEAR. AND US DEFINITION MáS WHO IS HERE TO GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF THE FEAR OF GAMBLING CONTROL ACTIVITIES -- AT THIS POINT WE'RE HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. FINISH MáS THE DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU GALLON CONTROL -- JUST BITE CAM BACKGROUND THE BEER WORKS IN COOPERATION WITH THE COMING TOGETHER CALIFORNIA GIMLI CONTROL COMMISSION TO BASICALLY PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF GAMING IN THE STATE -- BUT THE BUREAU DOES -- ALL FOR ITS PART IS TO CONDUCT SOME BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES WHO ARE SEEKING LICENSURE TO WORK IN A CARD ROOM OR TO OWN A CAR DREW MORE THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS -- BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THE BUREAU HAD RECEIVED WAS SOUGHT AND RECEIVED TWELVE POSITIONS TO HANDLE SOME OF THESE -- BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION -- RULES -- THERE AFTER THE LEGISLATURE -- PROVIDED US WITH AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY POSITIONS FOR WHICH WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL AND THANKFUL -- FOR READY TIME NOW THE WORD THE FUNDING IS GONE FOR THOSE -- WHOLE THIRTY TWO POSITIONS -- WHAT THAT MEANS TO THE BUREAU IS THAT -- YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE AN IMPACT OR TO DECREASE THE KIND OF PENDING CASES OF THEIR IN HOUSE BUT ALSO TO KEEP UP WITH THE ONGOING WORK LOAD. WE'RE ON TRACK TO RECEIVE -- AN ADDITIONAL ONE THOUSAND APPLICATIONS -- MORE THAN WE WERE FROM LAST YEAR SO IT'S VERY -- IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE KEEP THOSE -- POSITIONS IN HOUSE -- FAILURE TO DO SO WOULD REALLY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER ULTIMATELY SUPPOSED TO DO WHICH IS TO KEEP OUT A EIGHT DISHONEST CORRUPT CRIMINAL ELEMENT OUT OF THE GAMBLING ESTABLISHMENTS. THE ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. ANY COMMENTS FROM FINANCE SHARE AND WHICH I WERE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I WOULD JUST SAY THAT -- LIMITED TERM FUNDING FOR THE BUREAU OF GAMBLING CONTROL IS -- KIND OF DIFFICULT -- HE'S POSITIONS IT TAKES AWHILE TO ON BOARD THEM TO HIRE THEM ANYTIME YOU HAVE LIMITED TIME TERM FUNDING -- THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE PEOPLE ARE GONNA FIND ANOTHER JOB AND IT TAKES IT TAKES AWHILE FOR THEM SO THAT'S WHY THIS PROPOSAL IS ONGOING -- FUNDING THERE'S ALSO PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE HAS PROPOSED THAT ALLOWS FINANCE -- UPON APPROVAL BY THE JAIL BC TO AUGMENT OR REDUCE THE BUDGET AS NEEDED BASED ON WORKLOAD NEEDS AS WELL. COMING FROM LA OKAY I NEED ONLY WHAT THEY ALEJO -- WE ARE RECOMMENDING -- PROVIDING ONE TIME FUNDING TO JUST RETAIN THE POSITIONS AND PART OF THE RATIONALE FOR THAT IS THAT THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR IS AND TOWARDS THE END OF COMPLETING AN AUDIT. OF THE REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES FROM THE GAME THE CONTROL FUND WHICH SUPPORTS THIS WORKLOAD AND PART OF THE SCOPE INCLUDE SOME THINGS THAT ARE CORE TO KIND OF AN OUT ANALYZING THE WORKLOAD SO FOR EXAMPLE. THEY ARE REVIEWING -- THE OVERALL PROCESS IN TERMS OF HOW EFFICIENT THE PROCESSES WHETHER THE STATUTORY TIME FRAMES ARE BEING THAT AS WELL AS WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS A BACKLOG AND WHAT ARE THE CAUSES OF THAT BACKLOG. AND SO PROVIDING -- FUNDING ON A LIMITED HER BASIS WOULD ALLOW BOTH THE BUREAU AND THE LEGISLATURE TO EVALUATE THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS AND KIND OF FIGURE OUT WHAT THE LONG TERM IPACT. OF THOSE COULD BE SO FOR EXAMPLE IT COULD INVOLVE CHANGES TO THE OVERALL PROCESS ARE KIND OF IT IN TERMS OF LIKE WHAT'S DONE THE TIME FRAME EXCITER AND SO THAT COULD HAVE RAMIFICATIONS ON ON GOING NEED FOR FUNDING AND STUFF. RIGHT ANY OTHER COMMENTS. BECOMES FOR MEMBERS. IS THE ONE FROM THE AUDIENCE. JUST VERY QUICKLY THIS OF THE AUDIT WILL BE RELEASED TOMORROW MORNING ACTUALLY SO THAT. WE CAN GET AN IDEA THAN WE CAN SPEAK TO IT BECAUSE IT'S CONFIDENTIAL BUT CERTAINLY THERE ARE THINGS THAT IT WAS FOR THE THE REJECTED THE BUREAU'S LOOKING AT CERTAINLY TO INCREASE EFFICIENCIES BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT -- WE BELIEVE THAT I MEAN NOT JUST THESE THREE TWO POSITIONS BUT POTENTIALLY WE WOULD NEED MORE POSITIONS JUST TO HANDLE  CURRENT ONGOING WORKLOAD THE KIND OF THE ANNUAL WORKLOAD THAT WE GET -- SO -- WE DO THINK THE PERMANENT FUNDING ALSO WAS FINANCE SAID HAVING THE HAVING THE DIFFICULTIES WITH THE HIRING -- WE ARE IN THE VISION LAW ENFORCEMENT IT IS AN EXTENDED HIRING PROCESS. AND THEN IT'S USUALLY LIKE A SIX MONTH PROCESS JUST TO GET SOMEONE. UP -- SIX MONTHS FOR THE HARRY BUT SIX MONTHS ALSO JUST TO GET THEM -- UP TO SPEED TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE WORKLOAD SO HAVING PEOPLE BE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR POSITIONS AND LEAVING IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO GET US BACK UP TO SPEED AGAIN SO. THAT'S ALSO CONSENT -- IT'S DIFFICULT WHEN YOU HAVE A TEMPORARY HIRING ARE YOU YOUR MONEY FUNNY AND SO AS A RESULT IT'S HARD TO GET PEOPLE TO THE STATE WE'VE HAD THAT WITH OTHER AGENCIES AS WELL. YEAH. PRESENTING PARK WEST CASINOS BUT ALSO SPEAKING IF YOU WILL WAS A AS A FORMER CHIEF DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL FROM PREHISTORIC TIMES WHO USED. TO MANAGE THIS -- WHEN IT WAS A DIVISION AS WELL AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT HAVING SUCH A? SIGNIFICANT FRACTION OF A RELATIVELY SMALL WORKFORCE BEING LIMITED TERM FOR AS LONG AS THESE FOLKS HAVE BEEN -- IS REALLY A BIG BURDEN ON THE REST OF MANAGEMENT AND GETTING THE JOB DONE I I DON'T I THINK I WOULD SPEAK FOR ANYONE IN THE INDUSTRY THIS IS ONE THING THEY WOULD AGREE ON IS THEY WANNA. PROFESSIONAL COMPETENT EXPERIENCED. STAFF THAT'S BEEN THERE LONG ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THE INDUSTRY. SO WE'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THANK MAKING THEM PERMANENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE OKAY OKAY.
