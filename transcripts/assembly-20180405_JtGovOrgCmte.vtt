PACIFIC WE WILL BE PROVIDING AN

00:27:16.768 --> 00:27:20.873 region:rollup2
OVERVIEW OF THE TRIBAL GAMING

00:27:19.138 --> 00:27:23.275 region:rollup2
FUNDS HOW THE FISCAL CONDITION

00:27:20.873 --> 00:27:24.343 region:rollup2
OF THESE FUNDS HAVE CHANGED IN

00:27:23.275 --> 00:27:24.676 region:rollup2
RECENT YEARS TO ISSUE THE

00:27:24.343 --> 00:27:25.911 region:rollup2
RENEGOTIATION

00:27:24.676 --> 00:27:27.279 region:rollup2
COMPAQ.

00:27:25.911 --> 00:27:28.981 region:rollup2
AND THEN ALSO ESTIMATES FOR HOW

MUCH COULD BE DEPOSITED INTO A

00:27:28.981 --> 00:27:32.217 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF THESE FUNDS IN THE

00:27:30.082 --> 00:27:34.052 region:rollup2
FUTURE.

00:27:32.217 --> 00:27:35.854 region:rollup2
SO IN PRIOR YEARS GAMING

00:27:34.052 --> 00:27:37.923 region:rollup2
COMPACTS GENERALLY REQUIRE

00:27:35.854 --> 00:27:39.892 region:rollup2
TRIBES MAKE PAYMENTS INTO

00:27:37.923 --> 00:27:41.660 region:rollup2

ON CERTAIN CONDITIONS.

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:44.229 region:rollup2
AND SO THESE ACCOUNTS WHERE THE

00:27:43.095 --> 00:27:45.397 region:rollup2
REVENUE SHARING TRUST FUND THE

00:27:44.229 --> 00:27:46.932 region:rollup2

THAT WENT.

00:28:03.315 --> 00:28:06.618 region:rollup2
SO PAYMENTS THAT WERE DEPOSITED

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:07.886 region:rollup2
INTO THE ARTIST YAFFE

00:28:06.618 --> 00:28:10.188 region:rollup2
ARE DISTRIBUTED TO CERTAIN

FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES THAT

GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO RECEIVE

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:21.333 region:rollup2

00:28:19.498 --> 00:28:23.569 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY.

00:28:21.333 --> 00:28:25.804 region:rollup2
SINCE TWO THOUSAND ONE TWO WHEN

00:28:23.569 --> 00:28:27.339 region:rollup2
OUR STAFF WAS FIRST CREATED.

00:28:25.804 --> 00:28:28.807 region:rollup2
ANNUAL EXPENDITURES FROM THE

00:28:27.339 --> 00:28:31.276 region:rollup2
FINE WHO GENERALLY EXCEEDED

00:28:28.807 --> 00:28:32.678 region:rollup2

FOLLOWING PRIORITY ORDER.

00:28:37.516 --> 00:28:40.919 region:rollup2
FIRST TO BACKFILL THOSE

00:28:39.685 --> 00:28:41.887 region:rollup2
SHORTFALLS IN OUR STF THAT I

00:28:40.919 --> 00:28:44.089 region:rollup2
JUST MENTIONED

00:28:41.887 --> 00:28:46.325 region:rollup2
SECOND FOR PROBLEM GAMING.

00:28:44.089 --> 00:28:48.226 region:rollup2
THIRD OF FOR REGULATORY COSTS

00:28:46.325 --> 00:28:49.928 region:rollup2
AND FOURTH PAYMENTS TO LOCAL

00:28:48.226 --> 00:28:51.096 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTS THAT WERE IMPACTED

00:28:49.928 --> 00:28:51.930 region:rollup2
BY THE TRIBAL CASINOS THESE ARE

00:28:51.096 --> 00:28:54.533 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES KNOWN AS LOCAL

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:56.602 region:rollup2
MITIGATION GRANTS.

00:28:54.533 --> 00:28:59.271 region:rollup2
SIMILAR TO THE RCF SINCE TWO

00:28:56.602 --> 00:29:00.339 region:rollup2
THOUSAND EATS NINE THE ANNUAL

00:28:59.271 --> 00:29:02.107 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURES FROM THE STF HAVE

00:29:00.339 --> 00:29:03.508 region:rollup2

REVENUES.

00:29:03.508 --> 00:29:06.178 region:rollup2
AND SO FINALLY CERTAIN TRIBES

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:08.013 region:rollup2
WERE ALSO REQUIRED TO MAKE

00:29:06.178 --> 00:29:09.348 region:rollup2
PAYMENTS INTO THE STATE GENERAL

00:29:08.013 --> 00:29:11.016 region:rollup2

00:29:09.348 --> 00:29:12.985 region:rollup2
IN THIS REALLY STARTED IN TWO

00:29:11.016 --> 00:29:15.287 region:rollup2
THOUSAND SEVEN EIGHT.

00:29:12.985 --> 00:29:17.389 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT

00:29:15.287 --> 00:29:19.024 region:rollup2
OF APPEAL RULED IN THE RING CON

00:29:17.389 --> 00:29:20.225 region:rollup2
BAND VERSUS SCHWARZENEGGER CASE

00:29:19.024 --> 00:29:21.760 region:rollup2
THAT THESE TYPES OF PAYMENTS

00:29:20.225 --> 00:29:23.462 region:rollup2
WERE NOT PERMITTED.

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:25.998 region:rollup2
SO IN ORDER TO ADDRESS ALL OF

00:29:23.462 --> 00:29:27.733 region:rollup2
THESE ISSUES THE STATE CHANGED

00:29:25.998 --> 00:29:29.201 region:rollup2
THE PAYMENT STRUCTURE THAT WERE

00:29:27.733 --> 00:29:30.302 region:rollup2

THAT WERE RENEGOTIATED IN RECENT

00:29:30.302 --> 00:29:34.172 region:rollup2
YEARS.

00:29:32.137 --> 00:29:36.775 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY THE RE NEGOTIATED

00:29:34.172 --> 00:29:38.610 region:rollup2
COMPACTS REQUIRED INCREASED

00:29:36.775 --> 00:29:40.379 region:rollup2
PAYMENTS TO THE ARTIST YEAH. AND

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:41.913 region:rollup2
AUTHORIZE THE TRANSFERS OF

00:29:40.379 --> 00:29:44.349 region:rollup2
MONIES THAT WERE NOT NEEDED TO

00:29:41.913 --> 00:29:44.950 region:rollup2
PROVIDE ALL ELIGIBLE TRIBES WITH

00:29:44.349 --> 00:29:46.051 region:rollup2
ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:47.352 region:rollup2
ANNUALLY.

00:29:46.051 --> 00:29:48.720 region:rollup2
THESE MONIES ARE THE ONES THAT

00:29:47.352 --> 00:29:50.289 region:rollup2
WOULD BE TRANSFERRED INTO THIS

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:51.490 region:rollup2
NEW TRIBAL NATION GRANT FUNDS

00:29:50.289 --> 00:29:53.292 region:rollup2

00:29:53.292 --> 00:29:56.895 region:rollup2
SO THESE FUNDS AS MENTIONED

00:29:55.127 --> 00:29:59.598 region:rollup2
PREVIOUSLY WORD TO BE ALLOCATED

00:29:56.895 --> 00:30:00.732 region:rollup2
AS GRANTS TO TRIBES I EITHER DID

00:29:59.598 --> 00:30:02.501 region:rollup2
NOT OPERATE CASINOS ARE AHEAD

00:30:00.732 --> 00:30:04.336 region:rollup2
CASINOS WITH FEWER THAN THREE

00:30:02.501 --> 00:30:06.371 region:rollup2
HUNDRED FIFTY MACHINES. FOR THE

00:30:04.336 --> 00:30:07.773 region:rollup2
PURPOSE OF SELF SUFFICIENCY

00:30:06.371 --> 00:30:09.975 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OR

00:30:07.773 --> 00:30:11.510 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT.

00:30:09.975 --> 00:30:12.678 region:rollup2
THE RENEGOTIATE COMPAQ'S ALSO

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:14.546 region:rollup2
ELIMINATED PAYMENTS TO THE

00:30:12.678 --> 00:30:17.049 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND AND GENERALLY

00:30:14.546 --> 00:30:19.284 region:rollup2
SHIFTED MITIGATION OUR OTHER

00:30:17.049 --> 00:30:20.919 region:rollup2
PAYMENTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:30:19.284 --> 00:30:22.921 region:rollup2
AWAY FROM THE STF.

00:30:20.919 --> 00:30:23.655 region:rollup2
AND INSTEAD TRIES WERE GENERALLY

00:30:22.921 --> 00:30:25.290 region:rollup2
SUPPOSED TO REACH THEIR OWN

00:30:23.655 --> 00:30:26.124 region:rollup2
AGREEMENTS WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:28.827 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR THESE

00:30:26.124 --> 00:30:29.961 region:rollup2
TYPES OF PAYMENTS.

00:30:28.827 --> 00:30:31.697 region:rollup2
AS OF THIS TIME AND THAT THE STF

00:30:29.961 --> 00:30:33.665 region:rollup2
WOULD GENERALLY BE ONLY USED TO

00:30:31.697 --> 00:30:35.801 region:rollup2
FIND STATE REGULATORY OUR

00:30:33.665 --> 00:30:37.302 region:rollup2
PROBLEM GAMING COSTS.

00:30:35.801 --> 00:30:39.037 region:rollup2
SO A NUMBER OF THESE RENEGOTIATE

00:30:37.302 --> 00:30:41.640 region:rollup2
CONTACTS HAVE JUST RECENTLY GONE

00:30:39.037 --> 00:30:43.675 region:rollup2
INTO A FACT SO THE FULL IMPACT

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:45.343 region:rollup2
OF THESE NEW TERMS ON PAYMENT

00:30:43.675 --> 00:30:46.545 region:rollup2
DEPOSITS INTO THE ARIAS TFR

00:30:45.343 --> 00:30:48.280 region:rollup2
GENERALLY UNCERTAIN.

00:30:46.545 --> 00:30:48.847 region:rollup2
PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES INDICATE

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:50.615 region:rollup2
THAT ABOUT.

00:30:48.847 --> 00:30:52.951 region:rollup2
A HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION WILL

00:30:50.615 --> 00:30:53.819 region:rollup2
BE DEPOSITED INTO THE OUR STAFF

00:30:52.951 --> 00:30:55.220 region:rollup2
AND THAT ABOUT EIGHTY MILLION

00:30:53.819 --> 00:30:57.889 region:rollup2
WILL BE NEEDED TO PROVIDE

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:59.491 region:rollup2
SEVENTY TWO ELIGIBLE TRIBES.

00:30:57.889 --> 00:31:00.859 region:rollup2
WITH THEIR FULL ALLOTMENT IN TWO

00:30:59.491 --> 00:31:03.061 region:rollup2
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN.

00:31:00.859 --> 00:31:04.696 region:rollup2
THIS MEANS THAT ABOUT TWENTY TO

00:31:03.061 --> 00:31:06.498 region:rollup2
THIRTY MILLION COULD BE

00:31:04.696 --> 00:31:07.966 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE FOR TRANSFER INTO THE

00:31:06.498 --> 00:31:09.167 region:rollup2
TRIBAL NATION GRANT FUNDS.

00:31:07.966 --> 00:31:11.136 region:rollup2
AND THIS COULD BE THE CASE

00:31:09.167 --> 00:31:12.838 region:rollup2
ANNUALLY FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS

00:31:11.136 --> 00:31:13.872 region:rollup2
IN THE NEAR TERM. IN THE LONG

00:31:12.838 --> 00:31:15.707 region:rollup2
RUN THIS AMOUNT COULD

00:31:13.872 --> 00:31:17.175 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY INCREASE TO EXCEED

00:31:15.707 --> 00:31:18.744 region:rollup2
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS BUT THERE

00:31:17.175 --> 00:31:20.345 region:rollup2
IS SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY TO

00:31:18.744 --> 00:31:21.646 region:rollup2
THAT. I THINK AS TIME GOES ON

00:31:20.345 --> 00:31:22.781 region:rollup2
AND WILL BE TRACKING THOSE

00:31:21.646 --> 00:31:24.249 region:rollup2
REVENUE DEPOSITS WILL HAVE A

00:31:22.781 --> 00:31:25.917 region:rollup2
BETTER SENSE OF WHAT THE FUTURE

00:31:24.249 --> 00:31:26.651 region:rollup2
LOOKS LIKE.

00:31:25.917 --> 00:31:28.086 region:rollup2

EFFECT SO THE IMPACTS ARE STILL

00:33:19.798 --> 00:33:22.400 region:rollup2
LITTLE UNCERTAIN. BUT

00:33:20.932 --> 00:33:23.902 region:rollup2
PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES HAVE

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:25.237 region:rollup2
INDICATED THAT ABOUT A HUNDRED

00:33:23.902 --> 00:33:26.571 region:rollup2

MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATIONS. SO

00:33:36.248 --> 00:33:39.384 region:rollup2
THIS MEANS THAT ABOUT TWENTY TO

00:33:37.949 --> 00:33:42.120 region:rollup2

FUTURE YEARS TO EXCEED FIFTY

00:33:47.592 --> 00:33:50.729 region:rollup2

00:35:42.173 --> 00:35:46.678 region:rollup2
ALSO MAKING MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL

00:35:44.109 --> 00:35:47.078 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES

00:35:46.678 --> 00:35:47.646 region:rollup2
SO IT'S NOT JUST.

00:35:47.078 --> 00:35:48.146 region:rollup2
TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE

00:35:47.646 --> 00:35:49.347 region:rollup2
BENEFITING BUT IT'S THE

00:35:48.146 --> 00:35:50.415 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THOSE THOSE

00:35:49.347 --> 00:35:50.949 region:rollup2
GAMING FACILITIES ARE LOCATED.

00:35:50.415 --> 00:35:51.616 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO

00:35:50.949 --> 00:35:52.550 region:rollup2
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE SUCCESS IS

00:35:51.616 --> 00:35:53.485 region:rollup2
NOT UNIFORM.

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:54.686 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:35:53.485 --> 00:35:56.187 region:rollup2
THERE ARE HUNDRED NINE

00:35:54.686 --> 00:35:57.722 region:rollup2
FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES IN

00:35:56.187 --> 00:35:58.256 region:rollup2
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FORTY

00:35:57.722 --> 00:35:59.557 region:rollup2
NINE OF THEM DON'T DO ANY

00:35:58.256 --> 00:36:01.226 region:rollup2
GAMING.

00:35:59.557 --> 00:36:02.761 region:rollup2
TWENTY THREE A LIMITED GAMING

00:36:01.226 --> 00:36:03.361 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS MEANING THEY HAVE

00:36:02.761 --> 00:36:04.996 region:rollup2
LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED FIFTY

00:36:03.361 --> 00:36:05.797 region:rollup2
SLOT MACHINES AND THEY MIGHT

00:36:04.996 --> 00:36:07.899 region:rollup2
CHOOSE TO DO THIS.

00:36:05.797 --> 00:36:09.734 region:rollup2
FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS WHETHER

00:36:07.899 --> 00:36:11.069 region:rollup2
IT'S BECAUSE. THEY JUST DON'T

00:36:09.734 --> 00:36:12.437 region:rollup2
FOR THEIR VALUES TO THE LARGER

00:36:11.069 --> 00:36:14.706 region:rollup2
PRINCIPLES WANT ENGAGING GAMING

00:36:12.437 --> 00:36:17.275 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS OR BECAUSE THEY'RE

00:36:14.706 --> 00:36:17.909 region:rollup2
LOCATED. IN AN AREA WHERE

00:36:17.275 --> 00:36:18.243 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO MARKET FOR THIS KIND

00:36:17.909 --> 00:36:20.311 region:rollup2
OF ACTIVITY.

00:36:18.243 --> 00:36:21.846 region:rollup2
BUT THE GOAL OF THE TRIBAL

00:36:20.311 --> 00:36:23.415 region:rollup2
NATION GRANT FUND IS TO ADDRESS

00:36:21.846 --> 00:36:24.749 region:rollup2
THE NEEDS OF THOSE SEVENTY TWO

00:36:23.415 --> 00:36:26.251 region:rollup2
TRIBES AND ENSURE THAT THEY ARE

00:36:24.749 --> 00:36:28.753 region:rollup2
ABLE TO AS THE PEOPLE ATTENDED

00:36:26.251 --> 00:36:31.189 region:rollup2
BENEFIT FROM FROM TRIBAL GAMING.

00:36:28.753 --> 00:36:31.790 region:rollup2
THE OUR STF WAS CREATED IN THE

00:36:31.189 --> 00:36:32.824 region:rollup2
NINETEEN NINETY NINE COMPAQ'S

00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:34.125 region:rollup2
WHICH.

00:36:32.824 --> 00:36:35.593 region:rollup2
PROVIDES THAT ONE POINT ONE

00:36:34.125 --> 00:36:36.561 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS WILL GO TO EACH

00:36:35.593 --> 00:36:38.396 region:rollup2
OF THOSE.

00:36:36.561 --> 00:36:38.563 region:rollup2
ELIGIBLE TRIBES.

00:36:38.396 --> 00:36:40.432 region:rollup2
IT.

00:36:38.563 --> 00:36:41.900 region:rollup2
.

00:36:40.432 --> 00:36:43.435 region:rollup2
THAT AMOUNT HASN'T CHANGED IN

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:44.769 region:rollup2
FACT I CAN'T CHANGED IN THE

00:36:43.435 --> 00:36:47.472 region:rollup2
COMPACT LANGUAGE ITSELF IT

00:36:44.769 --> 00:36:49.174 region:rollup2
SPECIFIED THAT ANY MONEY THAT'S

00:36:47.472 --> 00:36:51.076 region:rollup2
PUT INTO THE ICE T. F.. BEYOND

00:36:49.174 --> 00:36:52.377 region:rollup2
WHAT'S REQUIRED TO MAKE THAT ONE

00:36:51.076 --> 00:36:54.045 region:rollup2
POINT ONE MILLION.

00:36:52.377 --> 00:36:56.214 region:rollup2
DB XIN MUST STAY IN THE FUND FOR

00:36:54.045 --> 00:36:57.749 region:rollup2
FUTURE YEARS SO IT SIMPLY ISN'T

00:36:56.214 --> 00:37:00.485 region:rollup2
AN OPTION TO TAKE THE ADDITIONAL

00:36:57.749 --> 00:37:01.119 region:rollup2
REVENUE INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF

00:37:00.485 --> 00:37:01.386 region:rollup2
THE DISTRIBUTION THROUGH THE US

00:37:01.119 --> 00:37:01.553 region:rollup2
TO YEAH.

00:37:01.386 --> 00:37:03.388 region:rollup2
AS.

00:37:01.553 --> 00:37:04.689 region:rollup2
.

00:37:03.388 --> 00:37:06.591 region:rollup2
BUT CHAIRMAN INDICATED THE

00:37:04.689 --> 00:37:08.493 region:rollup2
GRADING COMPAQ WAS THE FIRST ONE

00:37:06.591 --> 00:37:09.461 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY TWELVE WHICH INCLUDED

00:37:08.493 --> 00:37:11.129 region:rollup2
THE TRIBAL NATION GRANT FUND.

00:37:09.461 --> 00:37:13.098 region:rollup2
.

00:37:11.129 --> 00:37:14.999 region:rollup2
IT IS GENERAL LANGUAGE AND THE

00:37:13.098 --> 00:37:16.501 region:rollup2
INTENT WAS ALL ALONG TO ALLOW

00:37:14.999 --> 00:37:18.203 region:rollup2
FOR IMPLEMENTING LEGISLATION.

00:37:16.501 --> 00:37:20.271 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE THE DETAILS OF HOW

00:37:18.203 --> 00:37:20.672 region:rollup2
THAT THE PROCESS WOULD WORK TO

00:37:20.271 --> 00:37:22.507 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT THAT.

00:37:20.672 --> 00:37:23.675 region:rollup2
.

00:37:22.507 --> 00:37:24.843 region:rollup2
THE MONEY GOT TO THE TRIBES IT

00:37:23.675 --> 00:37:26.177 region:rollup2
NEEDED IT IN A WAY THAT WAS FAN

00:37:24.843 --> 00:37:27.445 region:rollup2
HAVE LEGITIMACY IN THE EYES OF

00:37:26.177 --> 00:37:28.713 region:rollup2
ALL STAKEHOLDERS.

00:37:27.445 --> 00:37:30.181 region:rollup2
.

00:37:28.713 --> 00:37:31.416 region:rollup2
TO GET THINGS MOVING AND TWENTY

00:37:30.181 --> 00:37:32.951 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN WE STARTED TO HAVE

00:37:31.416 --> 00:37:34.052 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS WITH TRIBAL

00:37:32.951 --> 00:37:35.687 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTS AND THAT BECAME MORE

00:37:34.052 --> 00:37:37.455 region:rollup2
INTENSE OF LAST YEAR. WE HAD A

00:37:35.687 --> 00:37:38.957 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF CONSULTATIONS

00:37:37.455 --> 00:37:41.693 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND.

00:37:38.957 --> 00:37:43.795 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED DRAFT LANGUAGE WE

00:37:41.693 --> 00:37:44.929 region:rollup2
RECEIVED A LOT OF FEEDBACK A LOT

00:37:43.795 --> 00:37:47.298 region:rollup2
OF.

00:37:44.929 --> 00:37:48.833 region:rollup2
HELPFUL COMMENTARY ON HOW TO

00:37:47.298 --> 00:37:51.636 region:rollup2
MAKE IT BETTER AND WE PROVIDED

00:37:48.833 --> 00:37:52.470 region:rollup2
THAT TO THE OTHER STAFF. WHICH

00:37:51.636 --> 00:37:54.072 region:rollup2
IS WHAT IS NOW.

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:55.573 region:rollup2
AB EIGHT EIGHTY AND I WANT TO

00:37:54.072 --> 00:37:56.774 region:rollup2
BE CLEAR THAT NONE OF US THINK

00:37:55.573 --> 00:37:57.776 region:rollup2
THAT THE CURRENT LANGUAGE IS

00:37:56.774 --> 00:37:59.477 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY PERFECT WE. WE

00:37:57.776 --> 00:38:01.146 region:rollup2
WELCOME ALL IDEAS ON HOW TO MAKE

00:37:59.477 --> 00:38:02.447 region:rollup2
IT BETTER WE JUST DON'T WANT UP

00:38:01.146 --> 00:38:04.582 region:rollup2
PERFECT TO BE THE ENEMY OF THE

00:38:02.447 --> 00:38:06.251 region:rollup2
GOOD IF THE MONEY. DOESN'T IF

00:38:04.582 --> 00:38:07.785 region:rollup2
THERE ISN'T A MECHANISM TO GET

00:38:06.251 --> 00:38:09.587 region:rollup2
THE MONEY OUT THE MONEY SITS AND

00:38:07.785 --> 00:38:10.121 region:rollup2
THAT DOESN'T DO ANYBODY ANY GOOD

00:38:09.587 --> 00:38:11.422 region:rollup2
SO WOULD LIKE TO NOW SHE'S

00:38:10.121 --> 00:38:12.957 region:rollup2
PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE

00:38:11.422 --> 00:38:14.225 region:rollup2
CURRENT.

00:38:12.957 --> 00:38:15.727 region:rollup2
BILL PROCESS.

00:38:14.225 --> 00:38:17.362 region:rollup2
FIRST OF ALL AND I THINK THIS

00:38:15.727 --> 00:38:18.730 region:rollup2
IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT

00:38:17.362 --> 00:38:20.798 region:rollup2
ASPECT OF IT S THAT TRIBAL

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:24.435 region:rollup2
LEADERS WILL MAKE DECISIONS

00:38:20.798 --> 00:38:26.070 region:rollup2
ABOUT. THE THE THE DETAILS OF

00:38:24.435 --> 00:38:28.373 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNT IMPLEMENTATION THAT

00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:29.807 region:rollup2
DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY ARE JUST

00:38:28.373 --> 00:38:33.178 region:rollup2
SIMPLY GOING TO BE MAKING THE

00:38:29.807 --> 00:38:35.680 region:rollup2
DECISIONS ABOUT. AWARDING THE

00:38:33.178 --> 00:38:37.215 region:rollup2
GRANTS ARE ALSO THE ONES WORKING

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:40.852 region:rollup2
WITH THE TRIBAL ADVISER WHO WILL

00:38:37.215 --> 00:38:41.619 region:rollup2
ESTABLISH THE DETAILS OF THE

00:38:40.852 --> 00:38:42.353 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

00:38:41.619 --> 00:38:43.121 region:rollup2
THE BILL LAYS OUT CERTAIN

00:38:42.353 --> 00:38:44.055 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

00:38:43.121 --> 00:38:45.490 region:rollup2
PRINCIPLES SO THAT PEOPLE

00:38:44.055 --> 00:38:46.558 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS THAT THIS

00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:47.091 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IS GOING TO BE BUT THERE

00:38:46.558 --> 00:38:47.759 region:rollup2
LOT OF DETAILS AS THEIR

00:38:47.091 --> 00:38:48.760 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY I LEGISLATION THAT ARE

TRIBAL LEADERS WORKING WITH THE

00:38:49.394 --> 00:38:50.962 region:rollup2
TRAVEL ADVISOR THAT WILL MAKE

00:38:50.562 --> 00:38:51.396 region:rollup2
THOSE DECISIONS.

AND.

00:38:51.396 --> 00:38:53.364 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:38:51.596 --> 00:38:54.999 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS IS A COMPETITIVE

00:38:53.364 --> 00:38:56.367 region:rollup2
APPLICATION PROCESS THAT'S

00:38:54.999 --> 00:38:57.235 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE COMPAQ CLAIM WHICH

00:38:56.367 --> 00:38:59.337 region:rollup2
REQUIRES THAT IT BE A

00:38:57.235 --> 00:38:59.771 region:rollup2
COMPETITIVE APPLICATION PROCESS.

00:38:59.337 --> 00:39:02.307 region:rollup2
THE.

00:38:59.771 --> 00:39:02.640 region:rollup2
THE APPLICATION IS.

RECOGNIZE THAT THAT THESE ARE

00:39:08.746 --> 00:39:11.049 region:rollup2
TRIBES THEY DON'T HAVE THE

00:39:09.614 --> 00:39:12.717 region:rollup2
RESOURCES TO SPEND A LOT OF

MONEY ON GRANT WRITING. THE

00:39:12.717 --> 00:39:15.954 region:rollup2
INTENT IS TO MAKE IT A CONCISE

00:39:14.185 --> 00:39:17.488 region:rollup2
SIMPLE APPLICATION THAT PRESENTS

00:39:15.954 --> 00:39:17.789 region:rollup2
THE INFORMATION THE DECISION

THE GAMMA CONTROL COMMISSION

SHARING TRUST FUND IS IS BASED

00:40:57.255 --> 00:40:58.856 region:rollup2
ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT. I THINK

THAT.

00:40:58.856 --> 00:41:02.026 region:rollup2

THINK WE RESPECT AND EMBRACE

00:41:08.099 --> 00:41:10.101 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT PRINCIPLE THAT'S

00:41:08.666 --> 00:41:11.836 region:rollup2
WHY.

00:41:10.101 --> 00:41:12.337 region:rollup2
THREAT THAT WE NEGOTIATIONS THAT

00:41:11.836 --> 00:41:13.905 region:rollup2

00:41:15.306 --> 00:41:18.276 region:rollup2
THAT THE.

00:41:15.974 --> 00:41:20.678 region:rollup2
THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THE FUNDS

00:41:18.276 --> 00:41:22.213 region:rollup2
THAT GO INTO THIS POT WILL BE TO

00:41:20.678 --> 00:41:24.182 region:rollup2

INTO THE TRIBAL NATION GRANT

00:41:27.852 --> 00:41:29.921 region:rollup2

00:41:30.888 --> 00:41:34.859 region:rollup2
.

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:38.096 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN A MARGINAL INCREASE

00:41:34.859 --> 00:41:39.097 region:rollup2
AND FUNDING TO ALL THAT THAT.

00:41:38.096 --> 00:41:40.898 region:rollup2
INFUSION AND THAT'S A

00:41:39.097 --> 00:41:42.400 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUNDS CAN

00:41:40.898 --> 00:41:43.968 region:rollup2
MAKE IT MORE IMPACTFUL LONGER

IF IT'S PLACED IN THE* TF.

IT WOULD STAY IN THE US TF IT

00:48:00.144 --> 00:48:03.447 region:rollup2
WOULD INCREASE THE AMOUNT THAT'S

IN SOME OF OUR ONGOING

CONTACTS THAT WE HAVE CONCLUDED

00:48:39.617 --> 00:48:43.521 region:rollup2

WE ALL SUPPORT.

00:48:51.162 --> 00:48:54.165 region:rollup2
CAN AND MAYBE FINALLY.

00:48:53.097 --> 00:48:56.500 region:rollup2
IT MIGHT BE A QUESTION THAT I

00:48:54.165 --> 00:48:57.301 region:rollup2
CAN ASK YOU AND THEN THE TRIBES

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:59.403 region:rollup2
CAN BE PONDERING THIS QUESTION

00:48:57.301 --> 00:48:59.970 region:rollup2
AS WELL. DID YOU SEE ANY ISSUES

00:48:59.403 --> 00:49:01.172 region:rollup2
THAT MAY HAVE A ROSE THROUGH

00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:03.340 region:rollup2
THE.

00:49:01.172 --> 00:49:07.845 region:rollup2
THE ENTIRE PROCESS PROCESS LAST

00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:10.014 region:rollup2
YEAR DURING OUR CONSULTATIONS.

00:49:07.845 --> 00:49:11.382 region:rollup2
WHO WE WE HAVE WE TRY TO ADDRESS

00:49:10.014 --> 00:49:13.150 region:rollup2
THOSE YOU KNOW FOR INSTANCE

00:49:11.382 --> 00:49:14.685 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO GO?

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:16.287 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE LIST OF OF OF OF

00:49:14.685 --> 00:49:18.989 region:rollup2
CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED AND

00:49:16.287 --> 00:49:19.190 region:rollup2
HOW WE'VE TRIED TO TO RESPOND I

00:49:18.989 --> 00:49:21.192 region:rollup2
THINK.

00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:23.627 region:rollup2
.

00:49:21.192 --> 00:49:26.597 region:rollup2
YEAH AGAIN I THINK THAT.

00:49:23.627 --> 00:49:27.164 region:rollup2
THE CONCERNS A GENUINE AT AND

00:49:26.597 --> 00:49:29.433 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE.

00:49:27.164 --> 00:49:31.435 region:rollup2
TRY TO IN GRAY ENGAGE ALL THE

00:49:29.433 --> 00:49:33.370 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS AND AND I THINK

00:49:31.435 --> 00:49:33.938 region:rollup2
THERE'S A DEFINITE NEED. TO TRY

00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:37.041 region:rollup2
TO GET.

00:49:33.938 --> 00:49:38.576 region:rollup2
FUND ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO THE

00:49:37.041 --> 00:49:41.846 region:rollup2
RCF ELIGIBLE TRIBES IN.

00:49:38.576 --> 00:49:42.479 region:rollup2
I I BELIEVE THAT WE'VE GOT A

00:49:41.846 --> 00:49:43.147 region:rollup2
LONG WAY TOWARDS ADDRESSING THIS

00:49:42.479 --> 00:49:44.181 region:rollup2
CONCERN.

00:49:43.147 --> 00:49:45.483 region:rollup2
IT MAY NOT BE PERFECT BUT I

00:49:44.181 --> 00:49:46.383 region:rollup2
THINK IT.

00:49:45.483 --> 00:49:47.952 region:rollup2
IT THE LEAST GIVES US SOMETHING

00:49:46.383 --> 00:49:48.953 region:rollup2
TO START I THINK IT'LL BE IN

00:49:47.952 --> 00:49:50.020 region:rollup2
GOOD HANDS AS FAR AS

00:49:48.953 --> 00:49:51.488 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION AND CERTAINLY WE

00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:52.223 region:rollup2
CAN REVISIT ISSUES IF WE FIND

00:49:51.488 --> 00:49:54.158 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:49:52.223 --> 00:49:55.860 region:rollup2
DOWN THE ROAD THERE NEED TO BE

00:49:54.158 --> 00:49:56.727 region:rollup2
SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO THAT THE

00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:58.562 region:rollup2
BASIC FRAMEWORK

00:49:56.727 --> 00:50:00.164 region:rollup2
SO UNDERSTANDING THAT COMPARTE A

00:49:58.562 --> 00:50:02.433 region:rollup2
COMPONENT THAT LEADS ME.

00:50:00.164 --> 00:50:03.501 region:rollup2
TO THE TO THE QUESTION OF.

00:50:02.433 --> 00:50:05.236 region:rollup2
WHAT WE MAY HAVE AN

00:50:03.501 --> 00:50:07.304 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION CURRENT?

00:50:05.236 --> 00:50:08.973 region:rollup2
LEE IN PLACE THAT SUPPORTIVE IN

00:50:07.304 --> 00:50:09.340 region:rollup2
EMBRACING OF THIS WHAT HAPPENS

00:50:08.973 --> 00:50:11.075 region:rollup2
IF THE.

00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:12.209 region:rollup2
AND THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION

00:50:11.075 --> 00:50:13.444 region:rollup2
COMING AND HAS A LITTLE

00:50:12.209 --> 00:50:16.146 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THOUGHT PROCESS AND

00:50:13.444 --> 00:50:17.815 region:rollup2
MAYBE ISN'T AS EMBRACING.

00:50:16.146 --> 00:50:19.850 region:rollup2
HOW DOES THIS BINDER NOT BUYING

00:50:17.815 --> 00:50:22.052 region:rollup2
THAT NEXT STEP?

00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:23.754 region:rollup2
WELL I I THINK THAT THAT THE

00:50:22.052 --> 00:50:24.488 region:rollup2
COMPACTS ARE A STATE THEY'VE

00:50:23.754 --> 00:50:25.556 region:rollup2
BEEN OUR STATE LAWS EVEN

00:50:24.488 --> 00:50:26.824 region:rollup2
RATIFIED IN PLACE OF GOVERNMENT

00:50:25.556 --> 00:50:28.492 region:rollup2
TO GOVERNMENT AGREEMENTS THAT

00:50:26.824 --> 00:50:30.027 region:rollup2
THAT BIND US I MEAN AND DOES

00:50:28.492 --> 00:50:31.161 region:rollup2
COMPACTS.

00:50:30.027 --> 00:50:32.830 region:rollup2
CREATE.

00:50:31.161 --> 00:50:34.431 region:rollup2
THE REVENUE SHARING TRUST FUND

00:50:32.830 --> 00:50:36.934 region:rollup2
IN THE TRIBAL NATION GRANT FUNDS

00:50:34.431 --> 00:50:39.069 region:rollup2
THEY THEY HAVE THE THE THE

00:50:36.934 --> 00:50:40.237 region:rollup2
PURPOSES AND LIMITATIONS THAT

00:50:39.069 --> 00:50:42.139 region:rollup2
THOSE FUNDS HAVE SO ANOTHER

00:50:40.237 --> 00:50:44.441 region:rollup2
WHICH WE CAN INCREASE. THE THE

00:50:42.139 --> 00:50:45.709 region:rollup2
RCF BEYOND ONE POINT ONE MILLION

00:50:44.441 --> 00:50:47.278 region:rollup2
AND THE WAY THE COMPACTS RIGHT

00:50:45.709 --> 00:50:49.480 region:rollup2
NOW MONEY INTO THAT THAT'S IN

00:50:47.278 --> 00:50:50.614 region:rollup2
THOSE COMPACTS THAT INCLUDE THAT

00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:51.448 region:rollup2
TRIBAL NATION GRAPH AND WE'RE

00:50:50.614 --> 00:50:53.584 region:rollup2
GOING TO THAT FUND TO BE

00:50:51.448 --> 00:50:55.019 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE. THAT'LL BE BINDING ON

00:50:53.584 --> 00:50:57.721 region:rollup2
ON WHOEVER SITS IN AND IN THE

00:50:55.019 --> 00:50:58.022 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND AND I

00:50:57.721 --> 00:50:58.756 region:rollup2
THINK THAT.

00:50:58.022 --> 00:51:00.958 region:rollup2
.

00:50:58.756 --> 00:51:02.693 region:rollup2
THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO TO.

00:51:00.958 --> 00:51:04.261 region:rollup2
FOR LOTS OF REASONS ITHINK TO

00:51:02.693 --> 00:51:05.563 region:rollup2
TO HAVE A VEHICLE THAT ALLOWS US

00:51:04.261 --> 00:51:07.865 region:rollup2
TO MOVE THINGS FORWARD

00:51:05.563 --> 00:51:09.366 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT WITH WHAT IS ALREADY

00:51:07.865 --> 00:51:11.835 region:rollup2
STATE LAW.

00:51:09.366 --> 00:51:12.903 region:rollup2
DE AND SO SO THAT'S WHY WE

00:51:11.835 --> 00:51:14.471 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET THAT

00:51:12.903 --> 00:51:16.240 region:rollup2
NOW TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MONEY

00:51:14.471 --> 00:51:17.141 region:rollup2
JUST DOESN'T SIT THERE IT GETS

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:18.042 region:rollup2
OUT OF THE TRIBES THAT NEEDED.

00:51:17.141 --> 00:51:19.109 region:rollup2
EXACTLY AND I THINK THAT'S A

00:51:18.042 --> 00:51:20.644 region:rollup2
CONCERN OF EVERYONE TO MAKE SURE

00:51:19.109 --> 00:51:22.546 region:rollup2
NO MATTER.

00:51:20.644 --> 00:51:24.248 region:rollup2
WHO'S SITTING IN THESE CHAIRS IN

00:51:22.546 --> 00:51:26.483 region:rollup2
THE FUTURE THE MONEY FOLLOWS

00:51:24.248 --> 00:51:27.718 region:rollup2
WHAT WAS INTENDED FROM. THESE

00:51:26.483 --> 00:51:29.620 region:rollup2
DAYS MOVING FORWARD SO THAT

00:51:27.718 --> 00:51:31.555 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT.

00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:33.223 region:rollup2
UTILIZED IN OTHER WAYS THAT

00:51:31.555 --> 00:51:34.391 region:rollup2
MAYBE WEREN'T IN AGREEMENT. YES

00:51:33.223 --> 00:51:39.964 region:rollup2

THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:51:39.964 --> 00:51:43.334 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD GO IF YOU COULD DATA.

00:51:41.565 --> 00:51:44.535 region:rollup2
OKAY AT THE CORE OF THIS

00:51:43.334 --> 00:51:48.272 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION.

00:51:44.535 --> 00:51:50.407 region:rollup2
AND THIS TOPIC IT SEEMS LIKE.

00:51:48.272 --> 00:51:52.710 region:rollup2
I LIKE TO HEAR YOUR PERSPECTIVE

00:51:50.407 --> 00:51:55.145 region:rollup2
ON RESPECTING SOVEREIGNTY RIGHT.

00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:56.480 region:rollup2
AYE IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS

00:51:55.145 --> 00:51:56.981 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY OR WHATEVER

00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:58.248 region:rollup2
THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF

00:51:56.981 --> 00:51:59.883 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION IS WE WANT TO MAKE

00:51:58.248 --> 00:52:01.585 region:rollup2
SURE IT'S CRAFT IN SUCH A

00:51:59.883 --> 00:52:03.087 region:rollup2
FASHION THAT WE.

00:52:01.585 --> 00:52:05.255 region:rollup2
YOUR ACHIEVE THESE GOALS YOU

00:52:03.087 --> 00:52:07.224 region:rollup2
FLAT OUT ABOUT THE SAME TIME.

00:52:05.255 --> 00:52:09.159 region:rollup2
AB ABSOLUTELY WOULDN'T

00:52:07.224 --> 00:52:09.660 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK RESPECTING US ARMS

00:52:09.159 --> 00:52:10.694 region:rollup2
COULD YOU GIVE ME YOUR

00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:11.829 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE ON THAT. BUT YES SIR

00:52:10.694 --> 00:52:13.664 region:rollup2
I THINK A BIG PART OF IT IS

00:52:11.829 --> 00:52:15.366 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE THE ROLE THAT TRAVEL

00:52:13.664 --> 00:52:17.501 region:rollup2
ADVISOR SNYDER PLAYS I MEAN THE

00:52:15.366 --> 00:52:19.069 region:rollup2
REASON WHY. I THINK A LOT OF THE

00:52:17.501 --> 00:52:21.572 region:rollup2
DETAILS HAVE BEEN.

00:52:19.069 --> 00:52:23.841 region:rollup2
LEFT TO IMPLEMENTATION IS TO

00:52:21.572 --> 00:52:25.709 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT THE TRIBAL LEADERS

00:52:23.841 --> 00:52:27.344 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH THE TRAVEL ADVISOR

00:52:25.709 --> 00:52:27.878 region:rollup2
ABLE TO PUT THOSE DETAILS INTO

00:52:27.344 --> 00:52:29.880 region:rollup2
PLACE THAT THAT RESPECTS I

00:52:27.878 --> 00:52:31.849 region:rollup2
THINK.

00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:33.150 region:rollup2
NOT THE LEGITIMATE INTERESTS OF

00:52:31.849 --> 00:52:35.052 region:rollup2
OF ALL THE TRIBES IN THE STATE

00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:35.619 region:rollup2
THAT WENT TO GENERATE CONTRIBUTE

00:52:35.052 --> 00:52:37.321 region:rollup2
THE MONEY AND THE ONES WHO

00:52:35.619 --> 00:52:39.690 region:rollup2
RECEIVE IT NOT TO HAVE A PROCESS

00:52:37.321 --> 00:52:39.890 region:rollup2
THAT HAS LEGITIMACY IN THEIR

00:52:39.690 --> 00:52:40.958 region:rollup2
EYES.

00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:43.994 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S WHY WE.

00:52:40.958 --> 00:52:46.563 region:rollup2
UP INTENDED TO HAVE LEGISLATION

00:52:43.994 --> 00:52:47.865 region:rollup2
THAT. IT REFLECTED THE INPUT OF

00:52:46.563 --> 00:52:50.100 region:rollup2
OF TRIBES IN THE STATE AND

00:52:47.865 --> 00:52:52.903 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE.

00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:55.005 region:rollup2
WORKED HARD TO TRY DE GET THAT

00:52:52.903 --> 00:52:57.007 region:rollup2
INPUT AND CLEARLY AT WE CAN'T

00:52:55.005 --> 00:52:58.175 region:rollup2
TAKE EVERY INPUT INTO ACCOUNT IN

00:52:57.007 --> 00:53:00.044 region:rollup2
THE BILL WITH THERE ARE CERTAIN

00:52:58.175 --> 00:53:01.845 region:rollup2
CONSTRAINTS BUT BUT I THINK. I

00:53:00.044 --> 00:53:03.514 region:rollup2
THINK IN MY MIND.

00:53:01.845 --> 00:53:05.716 region:rollup2
IT'S THE AT RESPECTFUL

00:53:03.514 --> 00:53:08.018 region:rollup2
ENGAGEMENT INCLUSION OF.

00:53:05.716 --> 00:53:10.921 region:rollup2
OF TRIBAL LEADERS IN MAKING

00:53:08.018 --> 00:53:12.256 region:rollup2
DECISIONS THAT FOR RESPECTS

00:53:10.921 --> 00:53:14.925 region:rollup2
THEY'RE ON A LEGITIMATE ROLE IN

00:53:12.256 --> 00:53:15.926 region:rollup2
THIS PROCESS.

00:53:14.925 --> 00:53:16.693 region:rollup2
FORMERLY IT MY ROLES JUST GONNA

00:53:15.926 --> 00:53:18.028 region:rollup2
BE TO FACILITATE THESE

00:53:16.693 --> 00:53:21.098 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN SOVEREIGN

00:53:18.028 --> 00:53:22.332 region:rollup2
LEADERS AND SO ON.

00:53:21.098 --> 00:53:23.500 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THE WAY

00:53:22.332 --> 00:53:25.669 region:rollup2
THAT THE LEGISLATION IS ALREADY

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:26.737 region:rollup2
DRAFTED RESPECTS THE IDEA THAT

00:53:25.669 --> 00:53:27.438 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GOING TO BE DISCUSSIONS

00:53:26.737 --> 00:53:29.473 region:rollup2
THAT ARE.

00:53:27.438 --> 00:53:31.075 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

00:53:29.473 --> 00:53:32.409 region:rollup2
BEST LEFT TO BE BETWEEN

00:53:31.075 --> 00:53:33.377 region:rollup2
SOVEREIGN LEADERS AND NOT FOR

00:53:32.409 --> 00:53:34.578 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC AND I THINK THAT THAT

00:53:33.377 --> 00:53:35.913 region:rollup2
REALLY RESPECTS A LOT OF THE

00:53:34.578 --> 00:53:37.514 region:rollup2
COMMENTS AND FEEDBACK THAT WE

00:53:35.913 --> 00:53:39.550 region:rollup2
GOT PRIOR TO IT TO THE

00:53:37.514 --> 00:53:40.851 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION BEING DRAFTED. BUT.

00:53:39.550 --> 00:53:43.120 region:rollup2
I WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT

00:53:40.851 --> 00:53:44.488 region:rollup2
MY ROLE IS NOT. AS PUPPETMASTER

00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:45.222 region:rollup2
IT'S REALLY JUST BRINGING PEOPLE

00:53:44.488 --> 00:53:46.690 region:rollup2
TOGETHER AND MAKING SURE THAT

00:53:45.222 --> 00:53:48.158 region:rollup2
THEY ARE THEY ARE FOLLOWING

00:53:46.690 --> 00:53:48.492 region:rollup2
THEIR OWN RULES AND THAT THERE

00:53:48.158 --> 00:53:50.661 region:rollup2
ARE.

00:53:48.492 --> 00:53:54.698 region:rollup2
RESPECTING THESE PRINCIPLES OF

00:53:50.661 --> 00:53:55.332 region:rollup2
SOVEREIGNTY.

00:53:54.698 --> 00:53:57.334 region:rollup2

01:14:46.015 --> 01:14:49.485 region:rollup2
YOU CANNOT BUILD A NEW TROUBLE

01:14:47.383 --> 01:14:50.886 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT OFFICE.

01:14:49.485 --> 01:14:53.456 region:rollup2
YOU CAN EVEN BUILD ECONOMIC

01:14:50.886 --> 01:14:54.824 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT OR ROADS.

01:14:53.456 --> 01:14:56.959 region:rollup2
IF WE DISTRIBUTE THE MONIES

01:14:54.824 --> 01:14:58.928 region:rollup2
EVENLY.

01:14:56.959 --> 01:15:02.698 region:rollup2
NOW THIS IS AGAINST.

01:14:58.928 --> 01:15:03.632 region:rollup2
MY OWN TRIBE.

01:15:02.698 --> 01:15:05.568 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT THE BENEFIT OF MY TRIBE

01:15:03.632 --> 01:15:08.604 region:rollup2
TO SAY WHAT I'M SAYING.

01:15:05.568 --> 01:15:10.639 region:rollup2
IF YOU DISTRIBUTED EVENLY TO THE

01:15:08.604 --> 01:15:12.775 region:rollup2

01:15:10.639 --> 01:15:14.577 region:rollup2
QUALIFICATIONS IF YOU WILL.

01:15:12.775 --> 01:15:15.578 region:rollup2
MY TRIBE AND POLITICALLY.

01:15:14.577 --> 01:15:17.747 region:rollup2
I'VE CONSTITUENTS AT HOME THAT I

01:15:15.578 --> 01:15:19.915 region:rollup2
GOT ANSWERED TO.

01:15:17.747 --> 01:15:21.183 region:rollup2
WANT TO KEEP THE MONEY.

01:15:19.915 --> 01:15:23.386 region:rollup2
WHICH MEANS THE TRIBES THAT HAVE

01:15:21.183 --> 01:15:25.654 region:rollup2
NO GAMING ZERO GAMING.

01:15:23.386 --> 01:15:26.856 region:rollup2
HAVE NO LEVERAGE NO COLLATERAL

01:15:25.654 --> 01:15:28.924 region:rollup2
TO BUILD ANYTHING OR NO LEVERAGE

01:15:26.856 --> 01:15:30.292 region:rollup2
EVEN QUALIFY FOR OTHER GRANTS

01:15:28.924 --> 01:15:31.127 region:rollup2
THAT ARE OUT THERE LIKE THE LOW

01:15:30.292 --> 01:15:34.230 region:rollup2
INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS

01:15:31.127 --> 01:15:34.764 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE TO US.

01:15:34.230 --> 01:15:37.466 region:rollup2
THEY WILL BUILD TO BUILD A

01:15:34.764 --> 01:15:39.268 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY.

01:15:37.466 --> 01:15:42.738 region:rollup2
SO AS A TROUBLE CHAIRMAN.

01:15:39.268 --> 01:15:43.973 region:rollup2
IT'S REALLY HARD FOR ME TO.

01:15:42.738 --> 01:15:45.274 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT'S IN THE BEST

01:15:43.973 --> 01:15:47.710 region:rollup2
INTERESTS OF INDIAN COUNTRY IN

01:15:45.274 --> 01:15:50.513 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:52.648 region:rollup2
FOR COMEDY VALLEY TO.

01:15:50.513 --> 01:15:54.383 region:rollup2
GET A LITTLE EXTRA MONEY.

01:15:52.648 --> 01:15:55.251 region:rollup2
WHEN I HAVE TRIBES THAT ARE

01:15:54.383 --> 01:15:56.352 region:rollup2
SUFFERING NEXT DOOR TO ME.

01:15:55.251 --> 01:15:58.320 region:rollup2
STRUGGLING.

01:15:56.352 --> 01:16:00.423 region:rollup2
NO WATER.

01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:03.059 region:rollup2
NO WAY SYSTEMS.

01:16:00.423 --> 01:16:03.626 region:rollup2
NOT EVEN A JAM.

01:16:03.059 --> 01:16:05.361 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS ARE

01:16:03.626 --> 01:16:09.098 region:rollup2
FALLING APART.

01:16:05.361 --> 01:16:12.268 region:rollup2
FOR ME TO TAKE MONEY.

01:16:09.098 --> 01:16:13.369 region:rollup2
I PUT MYSELF FIRST.

01:16:12.268 --> 01:16:15.070 region:rollup2
I WOULD FEEL AS IF I WAS LETTING

01:16:13.369 --> 01:16:16.739 region:rollup2
MY COMMUNITY DOWN MY INDIAN

01:16:15.070 --> 01:16:18.474 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY DOWN. NEST NO

01:16:16.739 --> 01:16:20.142 region:rollup2
DISRESPECT MY COLLEAGUES HERE OR

01:16:18.474 --> 01:16:20.709 region:rollup2
ANYBODY ELSE OR ANY OTHER TRIBAL

01:16:20.142 --> 01:16:22.611 region:rollup2
LEADERS THAT ARE SPEAKING.

01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:24.079 region:rollup2
IT'S.

01:16:22.611 --> 01:16:25.481 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE WE LIVE IN DIFFERENT

01:16:24.079 --> 01:16:27.083 region:rollup2
AREAS POSSIBLY.

01:16:25.481 --> 01:16:29.251 region:rollup2
AND WHEN YOU'RE THE CHAIRMAN OF

01:16:27.083 --> 01:16:29.819 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN TRIBES.

01:16:29.251 --> 01:16:31.754 region:rollup2
AND MORE THAN HALF OF TRIBES

01:16:29.819 --> 01:16:33.522 region:rollup2
HAVE.

01:16:31.754 --> 01:16:34.657 region:rollup2
VERY LITTLE.

01:16:33.522 --> 01:16:38.327 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY HARD.

01:16:34.657 --> 01:16:38.961 region:rollup2
TO SAY.

01:16:38.327 --> 01:16:41.897 region:rollup2
THE SMALL GAME TRIBE GIVE ME MY

01:16:38.961 --> 01:16:44.333 region:rollup2
SHARE BECAUSE IT'S EASIER.

01:16:41.897 --> 01:16:45.801 region:rollup2
TRIBES HAVE THRIVED WE HAVE

01:16:44.333 --> 01:16:48.104 region:rollup2
TRIED CUT ABOUT THIS THRIVED ON

01:16:45.801 --> 01:16:49.238 region:rollup2
THE GRANT PROCESS.

01:16:48.104 --> 01:16:51.874 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WHEN THERE'S MORE MONEY

01:16:49.238 --> 01:16:54.410 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE AND IT'S COMPETITIVE.

01:16:51.874 --> 01:16:56.312 region:rollup2
YOU COULD DO A BIGGER THINGS.

01:16:54.410 --> 01:16:58.681 region:rollup2
WE ALL KNOW THAT'S WHY WE'RE

01:16:56.312 --> 01:17:00.115 region:rollup2
CONSIDERING THE GRANT PROCESS.

01:16:58.681 --> 01:17:02.518 region:rollup2
IF YOU DISTRIBUTE EVENLY WHAT

01:17:00.115 --> 01:17:04.353 region:rollup2
CAN YOU BUILD.

01:17:02.518 --> 01:17:06.422 region:rollup2
WHAT CAN YOU HONESTLY DEVELOP?

01:17:04.353 --> 01:17:07.756 region:rollup2
NOTHING.

01:17:06.422 --> 01:17:09.458 region:rollup2
SO ONCE AGAIN WILL BE LEFT

01:17:07.756 --> 01:17:11.994 region:rollup2
PLEASE TRY TO HAVE ZERO WILL BE

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:13.496 region:rollup2
LEFT STRUGGLING.

01:17:11.994 --> 01:17:15.631 region:rollup2
NOW SOME OF THE TRIBES THAT HAVE

01:17:13.496 --> 01:17:17.566 region:rollup2
ZERO WITH THE NOTES DISTRIBUTED

01:17:15.631 --> 01:17:18.901 region:rollup2
EVENLY BECAUSE.

01:17:17.566 --> 01:17:20.469 region:rollup2
THEY'RE AFRAID THAT THEY MIGHT

01:17:18.901 --> 01:17:23.405 region:rollup2
NOT HAVE THE.

01:17:20.469 --> 01:17:26.375 region:rollup2
STAFF TO QUALIFY FOR A GRANT.

01:17:23.405 --> 01:17:29.011 region:rollup2
THAT MIGHT BE A POSSIBILITY.

01:17:26.375 --> 01:17:30.846 region:rollup2
BUT IF WE NEVER OFFER A TRY FOUR

01:17:29.011 --> 01:17:32.615 region:rollup2
FIVE MILLION SIX MILLION TO

01:17:30.846 --> 01:17:33.949 region:rollup2
DEVELOP SOMETHING. THAT'S GOING

01:17:32.615 --> 01:17:35.818 region:rollup2
TO LAST A COMMUNITY FOR THIRTY

01:17:33.949 --> 01:17:37.219 region:rollup2
YEARS WHAT'S THE POINT OF THE

01:17:35.818 --> 01:17:38.254 region:rollup2
TRIBAL NATIONS GRAB FUN.

01:17:37.219 --> 01:17:40.055 region:rollup2
I AGREE THAT IT SHOULD NOT GO TO

PER CAPITA.

01:17:40.055 --> 01:17:43.125 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO. DISAGREE THAT IT

01:17:41.690 --> 01:17:45.060 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE

01:17:43.125 --> 01:17:46.162 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTED EVENLY WE HAVE SO

01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:48.197 region:rollup2
MANY TRIED STRUGGLING THAT DON'T

01:17:46.162 --> 01:17:49.698 region:rollup2

POSSIBLY PUT POLITICS ASIDE.

01:17:56.105 --> 01:18:00.042 region:rollup2
AND ASK YOURSELVES IF YOU WERE.

01:17:58.774 --> 01:18:02.678 region:rollup2
A TRIBAL CHAIRMAN OF A

01:18:00.042 --> 01:18:03.212 region:rollup2
RESERVATION THAT HAD NOTHING.

01:18:02.678 --> 01:18:04.446 region:rollup2

YOU KNOW WE WE RAISE THE ISSUE

01:20:41.003 --> 01:20:44.039 region:rollup2
OF EQUITY.

.

01:20:46.642 --> 01:20:48.410 region:rollup2
A GREATER VALUE RAISES IN EQUITY

01:20:47.876 --> 01:20:50.079 region:rollup2
CAN BE VIEWED A NUMBER OF

01:20:48.410 --> 01:20:51.313 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WAYS.

01:20:50.079 --> 01:20:52.748 region:rollup2
AND AND IN SOME RESPECTS FROM

01:20:51.313 --> 01:20:56.952 region:rollup2
EQUAL DISTRIBUTION.

01:20:52.748 --> 01:20:58.987 region:rollup2
THAT PROHIBITS FOLKS FROM.

01:20:56.952 --> 01:20:59.455 region:rollup2
ENGAGING IN SOME WAYS ARE

01:20:58.987 --> 01:21:00.723 region:rollup2

A POINT THAT MAYBE YOU COULD

01:21:01.824 --> 01:21:05.761 region:rollup2
WALK US THROUGH I THINK ON.

01:21:04.159 --> 01:21:07.396 region:rollup2

PART OF THAT BUREAUCRATIC

01:21:37.192 --> 01:21:38.761 region:rollup2
PROCESS THAT WAS BEING

01:21:37.659 --> 01:21:40.829 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED.

01:21:38.761 --> 01:21:42.097 region:rollup2

01:22:13.862 --> 01:22:17.232 region:rollup2
AS FAR THE DISTRIBUTION.

01:22:15.497 --> 01:22:19.034 region:rollup2
WHERE I THINK IT WAS MENTIONED

SEEK TRADITIONAL LENDING AND ALL

01:23:05.214 --> 01:23:08.450 region:rollup2
TRIGGER TRIES BE EQUALLY

THOSE FUNDS IN THAT FIRST YEAR.

01:23:19.061 --> 01:23:21.697 region:rollup2
ALL SEVENTY TWO TRIES BUT IF YOU

01:23:20.562 --> 01:23:23.432 region:rollup2
HAVE TO WAIT TO TWENTY YEARS

THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S

01:23:30.639 --> 01:23:32.641 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION IS OUT THERE THAT

01:23:31.540 --> 01:23:32.941 region:rollup2
HAVE VERY VERY LIMITED STAFF OR

01:23:32.641 --> 01:23:33.976 region:rollup2
NONE AT ALL.

01:23:32.941 --> 01:23:35.077 region:rollup2
.

01:23:33.976 --> 01:23:37.045 region:rollup2
WE TALK ABOUT A COMPETITIVE

01:23:35.077 --> 01:23:39.314 region:rollup2
GRANT PROCESS WE SEE THAT IN THE

01:23:37.045 --> 01:23:40.816 region:rollup2
FEDERAL. PROCESS RIGHT NOW WHERE

01:23:39.314 --> 01:23:42.017 region:rollup2
GRANT OF VERY COMPETITIVE YOU

01:23:40.816 --> 01:23:43.919 region:rollup2
KNOW AND EIGHT TRIBES HAVE TO

DEMONSTRATE THAT THE THE FUNDS

01:23:43.919 --> 01:23:47.055 region:rollup2
ARE GOING TO BE A GOOD PURPOSE

01:23:45.687 --> 01:23:48.790 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE GOING TO USE IT FOR

01:23:47.055 --> 01:23:50.459 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL.

01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:51.260 region:rollup2
APPLICATION.

01:23:50.459 --> 01:23:53.362 region:rollup2
KNOW HOW THE TRIBES GOING HELD

01:23:51.260 --> 01:23:54.897 region:rollup2
ONE TRIBE THAT HAS NO NO

01:23:53.362 --> 01:23:56.932 region:rollup2
MINISTRY OF STAFF GOING TO.

01:23:54.897 --> 01:23:58.901 region:rollup2
EUROPE AGAINST ANOTHER TRIBE HAS

01:23:56.932 --> 01:24:00.068 region:rollup2
A DECENT NO MINISTRY OF STAFF

01:23:58.901 --> 01:24:01.436 region:rollup2
THAT CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT THAT'S

01:24:00.068 --> 01:24:01.970 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE A SUCCESSFUL

01:24:01.436 --> 01:24:02.704 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS GOING CONTINUE TO

01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:03.839 region:rollup2
OPERATE.

01:24:02.704 --> 01:24:05.240 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE THE NOT

01:24:03.839 --> 01:24:06.141 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE EQUAL IN THERE FOR

01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:09.111 region:rollup2
THIS ONE PROBABLY WILL BE ON

01:24:06.141 --> 01:24:10.479 region:rollup2
PAPER A BETTER YOU KNOW AND THIS

01:24:09.111 --> 01:24:12.114 region:rollup2
ONE'S GOING TO BE RISKS YOU KNOW

01:24:10.479 --> 01:24:13.949 region:rollup2
A HIGHER RISK AND AND IT'S NOT

01:24:12.114 --> 01:24:14.550 region:rollup2
GOING TO WORK OUT FOR THEM

01:24:13.949 --> 01:24:14.783 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT GONNA GET. AWARDED

01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:16.285 region:rollup2
FUNDS.

01:24:14.783 --> 01:24:18.253 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'VE WE SEE.

01:24:16.285 --> 01:24:19.521 region:rollup2
THIS WHOLE PROCESS OF CREATING

01:24:18.253 --> 01:24:21.790 region:rollup2
ANOTHER AMINI B. I A IN

01:24:19.521 --> 01:24:23.825 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IS IT'S IT'S NOT SOME

01:24:21.790 --> 01:24:25.394 region:rollup2
THAT CALIFORNIA SHOULD WANT TO

01:24:23.825 --> 01:24:26.161 region:rollup2
DO YOU KNOW AND AND AND.

01:24:25.394 --> 01:24:28.997 region:rollup2
THE FUNDS THAT ARE BEING CREATED

01:24:26.161 --> 01:24:30.432 region:rollup2
IN THE AND AND THE TRIBES THERE.

01:24:28.997 --> 01:24:31.900 region:rollup2
ARE CONTRIBUTING TO IT THEY

01:24:30.432 --> 01:24:34.836 region:rollup2
DON'T WANT TO SEE ANOTHER

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:36.905 region:rollup2
PATERNALISTIC YOU KNOW OR. BE

01:24:34.836 --> 01:24:38.373 region:rollup2
AYE A KINDA RULE FROM CALIFORNIA

01:24:36.905 --> 01:24:39.975 region:rollup2
THAT YOU WANTED TO HELP THOSE

01:24:38.373 --> 01:24:42.044 region:rollup2
ELIGIBLE TRIBES TO GET MORE FOR

01:24:39.975 --> 01:24:43.912 region:rollup2
MORE REFUNDS. RATHER THAN OURS

01:24:42.044 --> 01:24:45.280 region:rollup2
DO YOU HAVE AND AND SO THAT'S

01:24:43.912 --> 01:24:46.515 region:rollup2
WHY WE WERE PROPOSING SOME

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:47.883 region:rollup2
THAT'S EQUAL BECOME A

01:24:46.515 --> 01:24:50.752 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTED EQUALLY TO ALL THOSE

01:24:47.883 --> 01:24:54.690 region:rollup2
TRIBES IN IN IN THE FIRST YEAR.

01:24:50.752 --> 01:24:56.058 region:rollup2
ALL SEVENTY TRIBES TUNISIAN

01:24:54.690 --> 01:25:01.229 region:rollup2
CHARGE CAN BE COOLEY BENEFIT

01:24:56.058 --> 01:25:02.397 region:rollup2
FROM IT. IT DOES STRIKE ME I'M.

01:25:01.229 --> 01:25:02.965 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THERE'S COMPELLING

01:25:02.397 --> 01:25:03.932 region:rollup2
ARGUMENT ON BOTH SIDES AS I

01:25:02.965 --> 01:25:05.667 region:rollup2
LISTEN

01:25:03.932 --> 01:25:07.536 region:rollup2
TO THAT DISCUSSION AND IT

01:25:05.667 --> 01:25:09.738 region:rollup2
STRIKES ME THAT COMBINATION OF

01:25:07.536 --> 01:25:12.908 region:rollup2
THE HONESTY OF.

01:25:09.738 --> 01:25:13.442 region:rollup2
AND THE TNG HALF. ABOUT CREATE A

01:25:12.908 --> 01:25:15.944 region:rollup2
KIND OF A.

01:25:13.442 --> 01:25:16.979 region:rollup2
DUAL TRACK SYSTEM WHERE YOU DO

01:25:15.944 --> 01:25:18.513 region:rollup2
HAVE A BASELINE

01:25:16.979 --> 01:25:20.115 region:rollup2
FOR EVERY TRIBE AND YOU ALSO

01:25:18.513 --> 01:25:21.116 region:rollup2
HAVE A SEPARATE FUND THAT COULD

01:25:20.115 --> 01:25:22.217 region:rollup2
BE AWARDED IN PERHAPS A LARGER

01:25:21.116 --> 01:25:25.554 region:rollup2
CHUNKS.

01:25:22.217 --> 01:25:26.421 region:rollup2
FORCED THE FOR THE SPECIFIC.

01:25:25.554 --> 01:25:27.656 region:rollup2
TYPES PROJECTS IT CHAIRMAN

01:25:26.421 --> 01:25:28.490 region:rollup2
HUNTER RAISED.

01:25:27.656 --> 01:25:29.491 region:rollup2
IT DOES SEEM THAT THERE COULD BE

01:25:28.490 --> 01:25:30.892 region:rollup2
SOME BENEFIT THERE BUT IT IT IT

01:25:29.491 --> 01:25:32.494 region:rollup2
IT RAISES ANOTHER QUESTION IN MY

01:25:30.892 --> 01:25:33.061 region:rollup2
MIND THAT PREDATES MY SERVICE.

01:25:32.494 --> 01:25:34.830 region:rollup2
IN THE LEGISLATURE IN SOME

01:25:33.061 --> 01:25:35.364 region:rollup2
RESPECTS WITCHES.

01:25:34.830 --> 01:25:35.831 region:rollup2
BOTH OF THESE FUNDS WERE

01:25:35.364 --> 01:25:37.165 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATED COMPACTS.

01:25:35.831 --> 01:25:39.501 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

01:25:37.165 --> 01:25:40.702 region:rollup2
SO WHAT'S YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON

01:25:39.501 --> 01:25:43.238 region:rollup2
WHY WE DIDN'T DEAL.

01:25:40.702 --> 01:25:44.072 region:rollup2
WITH.

01:25:43.238 --> 01:25:46.041 region:rollup2
HOW WE'RE GOING TO SPEND THE

01:25:44.072 --> 01:25:47.175 region:rollup2
MONEY AT THE TIME THAT WE

01:25:46.041 --> 01:25:48.243 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATED TO FIND IN THE

01:25:47.175 --> 01:25:50.078 region:rollup2
COMPACT BETWEEN THE STATE AND

01:25:48.243 --> 01:25:51.680 region:rollup2
THE TRIBE?

01:25:50.078 --> 01:25:52.881 region:rollup2
I MEAN OBVIOUSLY EACH TRIBE HAVE

COMING UP FOR COMBAT

01:26:13.735 --> 01:26:18.807 region:rollup2

.

01:26:27.082 --> 01:26:29.918 region:rollup2
THEY HAD TO BASICALLY TAKE IT

01:26:28.417 --> 01:26:30.886 region:rollup2

CHRISTOPHER CROSSES.

01:26:35.824 --> 01:26:41.797 region:rollup2
THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT ARGUMENT

01:26:36.458 --> 01:26:43.398 region:rollup2
WOULD BE THAT'S A NEGOTIATION.

01:26:41.797 --> 01:26:45.434 region:rollup2

01:26:43.398 --> 01:26:46.034 region:rollup2
DUCK TO PARTIES.

01:26:45.434 --> 01:26:47.969 region:rollup2

THEY WANT IN THE IN THE COMPAQ

BUT IT'S JUST INTERESTING AYE

01:26:48.570 --> 01:26:49.671 region:rollup2
AYE THAT WE DIDN'T IDENTIFY

01:26:49.137 --> 01:26:52.107 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:26:49.671 --> 01:26:54.676 region:rollup2
AND PERHAPS IT WASN'T FORESEEN

01:26:52.107 --> 01:26:56.845 region:rollup2
TO BUY SOME OF THE TRACKS.

01:26:54.676 --> 01:26:58.380 region:rollup2
MORE I'D I'D LIKE TO RESPOND AS

01:26:56.845 --> 01:26:59.815 region:rollup2
WELL CAUSE I WAS THERE IN THE

01:26:58.380 --> 01:27:00.816 region:rollup2
BEGINNING WHEN WE START THE

01:26:59.815 --> 01:27:02.651 region:rollup2
NIGHT I'M COMPACTS.

01:27:00.816 --> 01:27:03.919 region:rollup2

CALLED OUR STF.

01:27:03.919 --> 01:27:07.022 region:rollup2
AND AS EXACTLY WHAT WE MANAGED

01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:09.524 region:rollup2
TO DO IS GIVE THEM ONTO THE

01:27:07.022 --> 01:27:11.760 region:rollup2
TRIBES. THAT HAD LESS AGREE ON

01:27:09.524 --> 01:27:12.394 region:rollup2
FIFTY MACHINES NOW WE PAY INTO

01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:12.727 region:rollup2
THAT WE DON'T RECEIVE ANY MONEY

01:27:12.394 --> 01:27:13.762 region:rollup2
FROM.

01:27:12.727 --> 01:27:15.764 region:rollup2
BUT IS NOT OUR PLACE TO TELL

01:27:13.762 --> 01:27:17.332 region:rollup2
THEM WHAT TO DO WITH IT AND

01:27:15.764 --> 01:27:18.300 region:rollup2
NEVER DISRESPECTED A CHAIRMAN

HE'S DOING QUITE WELL.

01:27:20.635 --> 01:27:25.607 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THAT THE NEW TNG ACROSS

FOR THAT.

01:27:28.710 --> 01:27:30.846 region:rollup2
HE IS DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB

01:27:29.878 --> 01:27:31.379 region:rollup2
THERE'S SOME TRIBES ARE JUST

01:27:30.846 --> 01:27:32.614 region:rollup2
THAT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE.

01:27:31.379 --> 01:27:34.850 region:rollup2
BUT. ON THE OTHER HAND THEY MAY

01:27:32.614 --> 01:27:35.851 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO LOOK TO THEM AS WELL

01:27:34.850 --> 01:27:36.418 region:rollup2
AND SO WILL LOOK THIS IS WHAT

01:27:35.851 --> 01:27:36.718 region:rollup2
THEY DID AND WE COULD DO THE

01:27:36.418 --> 01:27:40.122 region:rollup2
SAME THING.

01:27:36.718 --> 01:27:41.990 region:rollup2
SO.

SERVES ME THE THE.

01:27:44.426 --> 01:27:46.995 region:rollup2
KID JEFF OBVIOUSLY WAS

01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:48.964 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED.

01:27:46.995 --> 01:27:50.966 region:rollup2
LATER THAN THEY ARE CITY FM FOR

01:27:48.964 --> 01:27:52.534 region:rollup2

MY QUESTIONS MORE PER THAT.

01:27:52.534 --> 01:27:55.370 region:rollup2
UPON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THAT

01:27:53.869 --> 01:27:56.805 region:rollup2
FUND. WHY THE VARIOUS PARTIES

01:27:55.370 --> 01:27:57.305 region:rollup2
INCLUDING ADMINISTRATION AND THE

01:27:56.805 --> 01:27:57.739 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE DIDN'T

NEGOTIATE?

01:27:57.739 --> 01:28:02.244 region:rollup2
WELL THIS IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO.

01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:04.679 region:rollup2
ALLOCATE OR SPEND THESE FUNDS

01:28:02.244 --> 01:28:05.847 region:rollup2
WELL I GUESS I I DO.

01:28:04.679 --> 01:28:09.417 region:rollup2
RIGHT THERE WITH VIA.

01:28:05.847 --> 01:28:10.418 region:rollup2
DIDN'T ASK US EITHER SO.

01:28:09.417 --> 01:28:11.720 region:rollup2
OKAY PUBLIC.

01:28:10.418 --> 01:28:13.221 region:rollup2
IT'S KINDA GOES BACK TO THE

01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:15.423 region:rollup2
FACT WHICH PUBLIC HEARD FOR IN

01:28:13.221 --> 01:28:17.092 region:rollup2
THE CONSULTATIONS AS JOE DOING

01:28:15.423 --> 01:28:18.627 region:rollup2
AND MENTION.

01:28:17.092 --> 01:28:19.628 region:rollup2
IS TO DIVERSE.

01:28:18.627 --> 01:28:21.296 region:rollup2
THE DUBBED THE PERSPECTIVES OF

01:28:19.628 --> 01:28:22.297 region:rollup2
THE TRIBES YOU KNOW SOME WANTED

01:28:21.296 --> 01:28:23.098 region:rollup2
SOMEONE IT THIS WAY OTHERS ARE

01:28:22.297 --> 01:28:24.499 region:rollup2
OPPOSED TO IT.

01:28:23.098 --> 01:28:25.433 region:rollup2
WEARS A BECAUSE OF THE

01:28:24.499 --> 01:28:26.067 region:rollup2
BUREAUCRACY TO THE PROCESS

01:28:25.433 --> 01:28:27.035 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOING TO BE CREATED INTO

01:28:26.067 --> 01:28:29.304 region:rollup2
IT YOU KNOW THAT THE COMPETITIVE

01:28:27.035 --> 01:28:30.338 region:rollup2
PROCESS YOU KNOW AND THEN HAVING

01:28:29.304 --> 01:28:32.007 region:rollup2
A PANEL WHILE AND HAVE TO REVIEW

01:28:30.338 --> 01:28:33.809 region:rollup2
IN. AND SAY HEY YOU KNOW WHAT

01:28:32.007 --> 01:28:34.943 region:rollup2
TRIBE YOUR TRIED NEEDS ARE

01:28:33.809 --> 01:28:36.778 region:rollup2
GREATER THAN THIS TRIBES NEEDS

01:28:34.943 --> 01:28:37.746 region:rollup2
NO PUT EVERY TRIBE AS A SELF

01:28:36.778 --> 01:28:38.947 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT HAS THE RIGHT TO

01:28:37.746 --> 01:28:40.982 region:rollup2
DETERMINE WHAT'S PRIORITIES OR

01:28:38.947 --> 01:28:42.551 region:rollup2
ITS OWN. AND IT SHOULD BE LEFT

01:28:40.982 --> 01:28:43.885 region:rollup2
UP TO A PANEL OR SOMEBODY ELSE

01:28:42.551 --> 01:28:46.688 region:rollup2
ANOTHER TRIBE.

01:28:43.885 --> 01:28:48.190 region:rollup2
TO TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT

01:28:46.688 --> 01:28:49.724 region:rollup2
THEY CAN HAVE THAT BECAUSE AND

01:28:48.190 --> 01:28:51.993 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S PROBABLY MOST LIKELY

01:28:49.724 --> 01:28:53.695 region:rollup2
THE REASON WHY A A FRAMEWORK

01:28:51.993 --> 01:28:56.932 region:rollup2
HASN'T BEEN.

01:28:53.695 --> 01:28:59.534 region:rollup2
DRAFTED IN PUTTING ANY COMPACT

01:28:56.932 --> 01:29:02.003 region:rollup2
AND STILL THE FRAMEWORK STILL

01:28:59.534 --> 01:29:05.273 region:rollup2
NOT EVEN IN AB EIGHTY AS IT IS

01:29:02.003 --> 01:29:09.644 region:rollup2

FRAMER COULD HAVE BEEN

01:29:12.547 --> 01:29:16.351 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED PRIOR TO ADOPTING. A

01:29:14.416 --> 01:29:17.319 region:rollup2

COMPACT ON BOTH SIDES COULD

01:29:19.421 --> 01:29:22.257 region:rollup2
HAVE.

01:29:20.522 --> 01:29:23.225 region:rollup2
I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:29:22.257 --> 01:29:24.192 region:rollup2
ESTABLISH THAT FRAMEWORK AND

01:29:23.225 --> 01:29:26.494 region:rollup2

DAMAGE THAT FRAMEWORK THAT

01:29:27.062 --> 01:29:30.665 region:rollup2
WASN'T. OBVIOUSLY ESTABLISH SO

01:29:29.931 --> 01:29:31.566 region:rollup2

I THE TRIBAL NATIONS GRANT FUND

WITH THE EXCESS MONEY WOULD GIVE

01:38:31.973 --> 01:38:35.643 region:rollup2
TRIBES AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAP

01:38:33.875 --> 01:38:36.244 region:rollup2
INTO OTHER RESOURCES IN GRANTS

TRIBES.

01:38:38.179 --> 01:38:43.151 region:rollup2
I SEE THAT THE LANGUAGE HAS.

01:38:41.349 --> 01:38:45.586 region:rollup2
COMPETITIVE GRANTS IN IT AND

01:38:43.151 --> 01:38:46.921 region:rollup2
THAT'S KIND OF THE CONTENTION.

01:38:45.586 --> 01:38:47.922 region:rollup2
YEAH A HUNDRED NINE TRIBES IN

01:38:46.921 --> 01:38:50.158 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SO YOU GET A HUNDRED

01:38:47.922 --> 01:38:50.992 region:rollup2
NINE DIFFERENT VIEWS ON THIS BUT

01:38:50.158 --> 01:38:53.594 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE'S A BALANCE THAT

01:38:50.992 --> 01:38:55.396 region:rollup2
CAN BE STRUCK BETWEEN THIS OF.

01:38:53.594 --> 01:38:56.664 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL COMPETITIVE GRANTS

01:38:55.396 --> 01:38:58.699 region:rollup2
THAT IF THERE'S THIRTY MILLION

01:38:56.664 --> 01:39:00.201 region:rollup2
IN A POT FIFTEEN MILLION OF ITS

01:38:58.699 --> 01:39:01.769 region:rollup2
FOR COMPETITIVE GRANTS IN THE

01:39:00.201 --> 01:39:04.005 region:rollup2
OTHER FIFTEEN COULD BE.

01:39:01.769 --> 01:39:06.073 region:rollup2
SPLIT EQUALLY AMONG TRIBES

01:39:04.005 --> 01:39:08.142 region:rollup2
THAT ARE ARE STF.

01:39:06.073 --> 01:39:08.643 region:rollup2
AND THOSE EQUALLY AMOUNTS COULD

01:39:08.142 --> 01:39:09.944 region:rollup2
BE BASED OFF OF HOW MANY

01:39:08.643 --> 01:39:11.479 region:rollup2
MEMBERS.

01:39:09.944 --> 01:39:13.147 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OUR TRIBE HAS EIGHT

01:39:11.479 --> 01:39:14.916 region:rollup2
HUNDRED MEMBERS CLOSELY AND WE A

01:39:13.147 --> 01:39:15.550 region:rollup2
ONE POINT ONE MILLION AND HAVE

01:39:14.916 --> 01:39:16.984 region:rollup2
ANOTHER TRY THAT MAY ONLY HAVE

01:39:15.550 --> 01:39:18.853 region:rollup2
THIRTY MEMBERS AND THEY GET ONE

01:39:16.984 --> 01:39:20.721 region:rollup2
POINT ONE MILLION. SO THERE'S

01:39:18.853 --> 01:39:21.823 region:rollup2
LITTLE DIVERSITY THERE WHAT YOU

01:39:20.721 --> 01:39:23.124 region:rollup2

01:39:21.823 --> 01:39:24.725 region:rollup2
