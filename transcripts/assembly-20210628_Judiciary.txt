CORRECT ALRIGHT MR TOO AB EIGHT THIRTY TWO. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. COLLEAGUES AB THIRTY TWO ADDRESSES AND EVICTION CRISIS THAT LOOMS OF CURRENT PROTECTIONS ARE NOT EXTENDED BEYOND JUNE THIRTIETH WHICH IS THIS WEDNESDAY. DESPITE VACCINATIONS IN THE ECONOMY RE OPENING MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE STILL AND PRECARIOUS FINANCIAL SITUATIONS. TENANTS STRUGGLING WITH SKYROCKETING RENTS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC HAVE BORNE THE BRUNT OF UNPRECEDENTED JOB LOSSES DURING THE PAST FIFTEEN MONTHS. THIS PAST MONTH ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIA RENTAL HOUSEHOLDS REPORTED TO THE CENSUS SLIGHT OR NO CONFIDENCE IN THEIR ABILITY TO PAY NEXT MONTH'S RENT. A RECENT POLICY LIKE ANALYSIS ESTIMATED NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS ARE BEHIND ON RENT. AND AT THE SAME TIME CALIFORNIA'S RECEIVED A RECORD FIVE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL RENTAL ASSISTANCE FUNDS BUT AS WE ALL KNOW ONLY A SMALL FRACTION IS ACTUALLY BEEN RECEIVED BY STRUGGLING RENTERS AND LANDLORDS. WITH THE BILL FUNDING AND TEAM ENDING ELECTION PROTECTIONS NOW WOULD BE FUMBLING ON THE ONE YARD LINE. IT WOULD BE TRAGIC TO PICK FAMILIES ON TO THE STREET IF WE CAN KEEP THEM IN THEIR HOMES WITH RENT REALLY FUNDING. THIS BILL DOESN'T NUMBER OF THINGS FIRST IT EXTENDS THE CURRENT EVICTION PROTECTIONS FOR THREE MORE MONTHS UNTIL SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH. SO THAT ELIGIBLE TENANTS AND THE LANDLORDS CAN RECEIVE FUNDING. SECOND THIS BILL EXPANDS PAYMENT RATES FOR LANDLORDS AND TENANTS. CURRENTLY LANDLORDS ARE REQUIRED TO FORGIVE 20% A RENTAL DEBT IN ORDER TO RECEIVE ASSISTANCE FOR THE REMAINING ONLY RECEIVE ASSISTANCE 425% OF RENTAL DEBT. THIS BILL ELIMINATES THOSE REQUIREMENTS SUCH THAT LANDLORDS AND TENANTS WOULD BE ABLE TO RECEIVE A 100% OF RENT OWED. FOR THOSE WHO ALREADY RECEIVE RENTAL ASSISTANCE REPLIED FOR IT. TOP UP PAYMENTS WILL ASSIST GETTING THEM UP TO A 100% THAT WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY PROCESSED. LANDLORDS WHOSE TENANTS HAVE MOVED OUT BUT ARE STILL OWED RENTAL PAYMENTS CAN APPLY AS WELL. AND TENANTS WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR RENTAL ASSISTANCE DIRECTLY. THIRD AFTER EVICTION PROTECTIONS END ON SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH THIS BILL CREATES A SIX MONTH BACKSTOPS PROCESS DEPOSIT ACTIONS FOR TENANTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE BUT NEED ADDITIONAL TIME TO ACCESS AT. AND FOURTH COURT RECORDS RELATED TO EVICTIONS CORRECT NONPAYMENT DURING COVERT WAR FOR THE COLLECTION OF COVERED RENTAL DEBT WILL BE PERMANENTLY SEALED TO AVOID IMPACTING A PERSON'S LONG TERM CREDIT OR ABILITY TO APPLY. FOR FUTURE HOUSING. WHAT PRIOR COVERT EVICTION PROTECTION BILLS THIS BILL IS BY NO MEANS PERFECT. BUT IF WE DON'T MOVE THIS BILL BEFORE JUNE THIRTIETH WE COULD SEE A WAVE OF AFFECTIONS AND HOMELESSNESS WELL BILLIONS OF FEDERAL FUNDING OUR UNTAPPED WE WOULD SERIOUSLY UNDERMINE THE CHANCES OF HELPING OUR MOST VALUABLE CALIFORNIANS RECOVER FROM THE PANDEMIC. WITH THAT WOULD LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR MAIN WITNESSES WE HAVE BRIAN ACOSTA REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION. AS WELL AS DEBT CARLTON FROM THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION AND I ALSO WANT TO JUST MENTION WE HAVE IN CASE OR ANY QUESTIONS ON THE RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM ON STAND BY. A TECHNICAL WITNESS MYLES WHITE FROM THE BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING AGENCY% WITHOUT. LIKE TO TURN OVER TO WITNESSES. THANK YOU THIS IS YOUR YOU HAVE THOSE THREE WITNESSES LISTED. NEVER COLTON BRYAN ACOSTA DAN MILES WHITES SO WE'LL START WITH THE OVERCROWDING PLEASE. THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS DIFFICULTY WITH A CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY A FEW WORDS TODAY. YOU KNOW WE'RE HERE FOR THE THIRD TIME TO EXTEND EVICTION MORATORIUM CA BELIEVE AND I HOPE YOU'LL AGREE THE INDUSTRY HAVE DONE MORE THAN ITS FAIR SHARE. FOR NEARLY EIGHTEEN MONTHS MANY HOUSING PROVIDERS HAVE RECEIVED LITTLE OR NO RENT AND THE BILL GIVES TENANTS ANOTHER THREE MONTHS BEFORE THE REQUIRED TO PAY. ALL THREE BILLS HAVE ALLOWED TENANTS TO RETURN THE DECORATION OF HARDSHIP TO THE OWNER. NO RENT WAS DUE AND NO PROOF OF HARDSHIP REQUIRED. IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT WITH EACH EXTENSION LEGISLATION HAVE NOT ADDRESSED THE SITUATION WHERE A TENANT RETURNS THE DECORATION. BUT THE OWNER LATER LEARNS OF THE TENANT DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR FUNDING. THEY REFUSED TO FILL OUT THE FUNDING APPLICATION OR THEY'VE LEFT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. IN THE END AND THEN THESE THE MOST EGREGIOUS SITUATIONS THESE TENANTS WILL HAVE A LIVE RENT FREE FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS. HOUSING PROVIDERS WHO WERE UNABLE TO EVICT THESE TENANTS WILL NEVER RECOVER ANY RENT FROM HIS TENANTS BECAUSE THE BILL DOESN'T ALLOW FOR IT. AND AS YOU MOVE FORWARD WE ASK THAT THESE OWNERS NOT BE FORGOTTEN WHEN THE FIRST REPORTS COME FROM STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND THE ACCOUNT FOR THE NUMBER OF TENDED TO FAIL TO APPLY OR WHO WHICH WERE REJECTED BECAUSE THEY DON'T QUALIFY. WE AFTER THE STATE CONSIDERED LOCKED. RENT PAYMENTS TO THOSE HOUSING PROVIDERS. AFTER ALL WITH LOCAL AND STATE SYSTEMS THAT ALLOW THESE KIND OF TOOK NOR THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO PAY THE RENT. WE MIGHT NOT BE HERE TODAY IF THE MONEY HAD COME SOONER IN MANY SITUATIONS OWNERS AND TENANTS APPLY FOR FUNDING IN MARCH AND STILL TODAY THEY'VE HEARD NOTHING. ALL THAT SAID I DO WANT TO SAY THAT WE DO HAVE SOME VERY. GOOD AND IMPORTANT THINGS OUT OF AB EIGHT THIRTY TWO. WE HAVE WENT COVERED AT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. PREEMPTION OF LOCAL LAWS THAT DIFFER FROM EIGHTY EIGHT THIRTY TWO. AND RENTAL ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS TO LANDLORDS WANT TO QUALIFIED TENANT HAS MOVED OUT. IN SUMMARY EIGHT THIRTY TWO ISN'T ISN'T PERFECT. IT'S THE ONLY OPTION HOUSING PROVIDERS AND TENANTS HAVE TODAY WE BELIEVE IT'S CRITICAL TO GET THIS MEASURE TO THE GOVERNOR AND TO EXPEDITE THE DISBURSEMENT. OF RENTAL ASSISTANCE FUNDS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LISTENING. THANK YOU AND THEN. ACOSTA THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AND THANK YOU MR CHIU PRESENTING THE BILL- BRIAN I GOT DONE GAP OF THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION. LIKE THE PRIOR SPEAKER- WE TO DO NOT TO BILLS THAT'S A PERFECT BUT WE THINK IT PROVIDES CRITICAL. PROTECTIONS THAT MUST BE EXTENDED- I WANT TO NOTE. THAT HIS ANTENNAS THE DEPARTMENT CERTIFICATION THAT THE PACE AT WHICH WE ARE GETTING. THE BILLIONS THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED A FEDERAL FUNDS OUT THE DOOR TO PEOPLE WHO NEED THOSE PAYMENTS IT'S GOING VERY SLOWLY. THAT'S THE LYNCHPIN OF ALL OF THIS SO WHILE WE EXTEND THESE PROTECTIONS THROUGH SEPTEMBER AND WE'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT- WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF. THE PROVISIONS WHICH PROVIDE ESSENTIALLY AN OFF RAMP FOR TENANTS WHO FIND. THEMSELVES IN AN EVICTION ACTION. YEAH NOT YET REACHED. ASSISTANCE FOR WHICH ARE. ELIGIBLE THAT THOSE ARE IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS. BUT GIVEN THE PACE IN WHICH THOSE DOLLARS ARE GOING OUT. I THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT AS WE MOVE THIS FORWARD AND WE MUST MOVE FORWARD AND- AND ARE HOPEFUL THAT IT WILL REPORT TODAY IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED IT. PROBABLY BUT AS WE DO THAT WE CANNOT TAKE OUR EYE OFF THIS PROBLEM- IF THE UPTAKE IN UP. I'M SORRY THAT PICKED DOES NOT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TECH IN THE RATE AT WHICH WE'RE GETTING THE DOLLARS OUT WE'RE GOING TO BE BACK HERE HAVING THE SAME CONVERSATION BECAUSE IT WOULD BE. CRITICAL FLAWS ALLOW. TO TURN BACK ON WHAT WE'VE GOT MONEY SITTING IN THE BANK THAT COULD. THAT COULD PROTECT THOSE HOUSEHOLDS AND SO WITH TODAY'S ACTION WE ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH HER PERCENT PAYMENTS. AND CONTINUED PROTECTION BUT WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO AND WE CONTINUE TO HELP THAT WILL BE PARTNERS. WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION IN MAKING THIS PROGRAM WORK MORE EFFICIENTLY AND GET THE DOLLARS TO EVERYONE. THAT IS IN ME. THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING OUR DOMINANCE.

THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- TO OUR HOUSING CHAIR- ALSO WANT TO EXTEND MY GRATITUDE AND HOW MUCH WORK THAT YOU'VE PUT INTO THIS I ALSO WANT TO THANK OUR LEADERSHIP INCLUDING OUR MAJORITY LEADER IN OUR SPEAKER- THE YOU KNOW BEING IN WELL MATTER WHERE YOU ARE IN CALIFORNIA FRANKLY BUT NO STATE STREET SPECIFICALLY TO SAN JOSE- THERE WAS GREAT FEAR OF THE LAST FEW DAYS AND WEEKS. LEADING UP TO THE THIRTIETH AND I KNOW SAN JOSE AT LEAST WENT FOR WAS WITH WITH ACTION IS A CITY BY THE END OF THE DAY AS A STATE WE JUST WE NEEDED TO ACT UP AND IT'S NOT ABOUT CREATING THE PERFECT IS ABOUT AVOIDING DISASTER. AND I THINK THAT- WITH WITH. THIS- WE LEASE OTHER. THE BILL TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND- SEE WHAT ELSE WE NEED TO DO OVER THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS TO MAKE SURE WE CAN CREATE GREATER STABILITY. BUT BUT WITHOUT THIS EXTRA TIME- TO YOUR POINT- ASSEMBLY CHU. I THINK THAT THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY A CLIFF THAT WE APPEAR SO WE ARE SO CLOSE. TO FALLING OVER SO I'M I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO YOU. AND YOUR STAFF BY NO CHRISTMAS AMONG THE TIME INTO THAT THINK INTO THIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. JUST GOT. YEAH PROBABLY WON'T SURPRISE ANYBODY THAT HAVE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT VIEW- I THINK YOU KNOW WE KEEP BEING TOLD THAT WE HAVE TO DO THIS WE HAVE TO DO THIS ITS ORIGIN- OTHERWISE EVERYTHING'S GONNA COLLAPSE AND IT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT'S ACTUALLY HASN'T BEEN THE CASE. I MEAN THE DATA THAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US SHOWS THAT'S NOT THE CASE EARLIER THIS YEAR. WHEN WE DID THE EXTENSION. SAYING THINGS ARE BEING SAID. WE CREATE THIS PROGRAM AND ALLOCATE- ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS- THIS SUPPOSED TO BE OUT THERE TO HELP PEOPLE AND WHAT WE GET SIXTY ONE POINT SIX MILLION. THIS BEEN DISTRIBUTED HERE IS NOT JUST. JAMES GALLAGHER A REPUBLICAN LEGISLATOR THE SAID THIS CENTER SCOTT WIENER SAID THIS- AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR WHEN HE SAID. LOOK I'M REALLY CONCERNED QUOTE I AM ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT ADMINISTRATIVE ROLE OUT OF RENT RELIEF GIVEN THE CALIFORNIA'S LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS. DURING THE PANDEMIC. COURSES SEEMS LIKE THAT. HAS KIND OF APPEARED TO BE THE CASE ONCE AGAIN- SO YEAH I MEAN IT IT'S EITHER ONE OF TWO THINGS AND I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S ALL TOGETHER CLEAR IT'S EITHER. MISMANAGEMENT AND GETTING THE MONEY OUT WHICH- I GUESS THAT COULD BE A PROBLEM FOR THERE'S REALLY NOT THIS DEMAND THAT EVERYBODY IS SAYING BECAUSE IN FACT THERE'S BEEN A AND I'VE ARGUED FROM THE VERY BEGINNING THAT THE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS WAS TO PROVIDE THE RELIEF TO THE PEOPLE THAT NEEDED IT. IN TERMS OF GIVING THEM SUPPORT. MAKING SURE THAT OUR EDT ACTUALLY GOT PAYMENTS OUT TO PEOPLE THATWERE UNEMPLOYED BECAUSE OF CO THAT HER FOR WHATEVER REASON. RIGHT GIVING THEM SUPPORT SO THAT THEY COULD PAY THE RENT. NOT SAYING TAKE AWAY THE ABILITY OR THE OBLIGATION. TO PAY RENT- TO ME THERE IS SO MUCH SUPPORT THIS OUT THERE FROM THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVEL- THAT IT'S IT APPEARS TO ME IN APPEARANCE FROM THE DATA FROM THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE ACTUALLY APPLIED. THE PEOPLE CAN PAY THE RENT. AND THERE'S ALSO BEEN. ACCORDING TO C. A. AND OTHERS DOCUMENTED CASES OF PEOPLE WHO COULD PAY AND ARE REFUSING TO PAY. OR THEY'RE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM AND AGAIN THESE PEOPLE ARE LEFT WITH NOTHING. AND MY PROBLEM ALSO FROM THE BEGINNING HAS BEEN. THERE'S NO ONE HERE REPRESENTING THE SMALL MOM AND POP LANDLORDS. AND SO I CONTINUE TO TRY AND SPEAK FOR THEM BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A LOBBYIST TO SHOW UP AS A YEAH WE'RE OKAY LET'S JUST KEEP THIS GOING- BUT MEANWHILE THEY ARE GETTING SHORT CHANGED. FOR NOW FIFTEEN MONTHS ON RENT. AND HAVE NOTHING TO DO ABOUT IT AND THEN IT AND ACCORDING TO THIS ONLY FIVE THOUSAND FOREIGN TWENTY TWO APPLICANTS LESS THAN BEEN MADE AVAILABLE. TO SMALL MOM AND POP LANDLORDS THIS DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THIS IS SOME HUGE SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM- THAT IS DESPERATELY HELPING HELPING PEOPLE INTEREST DESPERATE NEED AND THAT. YOU KNOW HERE HERE COMES A CLIFF IF WE DON'T APPROVE IT THAT JUST DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE THE CASE. AND I WON'T EVEN GET INTO HOW WE STARTED THIS WHOLE THING IT WASN'T US IT WAS ACTUALLY THE GOVERNOR BY EXECUTIVE ORDER WHO CHANGE LANDLORD TENANT LAW OVERNIGHT. WHICH I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I GOT A HARP ON THAT BUT IT'S A BIG PROBLEM THAT THE EXECUTIVE IS CHANGING YOUR LAWS. AND WE HAD NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT IT- AND THAT IS A JUDICIAL COUNCIL DECIDED TO SAY HEY COURTS. NO YOU CAN'T DO YOUR JOB OF EXECUTING THE LAW. ALL THESE THINGS ARE PROBLEMATIC AND AGAIN I JUST DON'T SEE. THE NEED TO CONTINUE THIS MORATORIUM. SUPPOSEDLY CALIFORNIA'S RE OPENED YOU KNOW IT WE WANT WE WANT US WE SAY THESE CONFLICTING THINGS REOPENED OR BACK TO BUSINESS BUSINESSES OPEN AGAIN PEOPLE CAN GO BACK TO WORK AGAIN- WE'RE DOING SO GREAT THE ECONOMY IS JUST GOING TO GANG BUSTERS BUT NO WE DESPERATELY NEED. THIS PROGRAM THAT NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE USING AGAIN LESS THAN 5% OF THE MONEY BEING EXPENDED AND I WONDER IF THAT'S ACTUALLY THE CASE LET'S ANNOUNCED TWO BILLION MORE DOLLARS WE'RE GOING TO THROW OUT THERE. RIGHT NOW I GOT FIVE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS THAT WERE ALLOCATED TO HELP PEOPLE. WITH RIGHT RELIEF AND THEN ACTUALLY NONE OF THAT MONEY ACTUALLY GETS OUT. TO HELP PEOPLE RIGHT IT'S SO VERY GAVIN NEWSOM. ANNOUNCE A BIG PROGRAM NOTHING GETS REALLY EXECUTED- BUT WE'RE ALL SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS. YOU KNOW THIS IS GREAT POLICY IT'S NOT AND I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS ANYMORE. THIS GONZALEZ. I WANT TO THANK YOU- FOR WORKING ON THIS I A I A REPRESENT A- LARGE QUESTION MY DISTRICT TO RENTERS I ALSO HAVE A LARGE PORTION OF A DISTRICT THAT WAS HIGHLY AFFECTED NOT BY STATE HOME ORDERS WITH THE FACT THAT THERE ARE- SERVICE WORKERS IN THE TOURISM INDUSTRY AND DESPITE OPENING BACK UP THAT DOESN'T MEAN THINGS GET BACK TO NORMAL RIGHT AWAY DOESN'T MEAN EVERYBODY'S- BEING HIRED BACK. AND I ALSO HAVE A HIGH NUMBER OF ESSENTIAL WORKERS WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED AND QUITE FRANKLY- SOMETIMESHAD TO STOP WORKING BECAUSE A CO ED- AND WE'RE STRUGGLING TO PAY THE RENT THIS IS NOT A PERFECT SOLUTION EVERYBODY SEEMS A LITTLE HAPPY IN A LITTLE UPSET THAT PROBABLY MEANS IT'S THE RIGHT SOLUTION- AND IT DOES PROVIDE A HUNDRED PERCENT- RECLAIMING OF AS MANY FOR THE LANDLORDS AND THAT'S IMPORTANT AS WELL WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE LOSING- THEIR THEIR RENTAL PROPERTIES WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE LOSING THEIR HOMES. SO HAVING GONE OUT WITH MY STAFF TO HELP PEOPLE FILL OUT THESE FORMS I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT WAS A DAUNTING EXPERIENCE THERE'S A REASON SO LITTLE OF THIS MONEY HAS GONE OUT IN ANYONE WHO HAS ACTUALLY GONE OUT AND TALKED TO CONSTITUENTS AND HELP THEM FILL OUT FORMS YOU KNOW FOR HOURS LITERALLY HOURS TO TRY TO FILL OUT THESE FORMS AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO APPLY FOR THE MONEY KNOWS THE BUREAUCRATIC HURDLES WE'RE DEALING WITH AND SOME OF IT NOT BECAUSE OF US BUT BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S REQUIREMENTS AS WELL. ON SOME THE RENTAL RELIEF SO- IS A PERFECT YOU KNOW WILL KEEP PEOPLE FROM BEING DISPLACED AND GROWING- NUMBER OF HOMELESS ABSOLUTELY IT WILL AND I THINK THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO PUT SO MUCH MONEY INTO ENDING HOMELESSNESS- THE LAST THING WE WANT IS FOR MORE FAMILIES BE HOMELESS AND SO I AT I KNOW THIS WAS NOT EASY- AND SO MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO I JUST WANNA THANK YOU BECAUSE I KNOW HOW MUCH TIME AND EFFORT YOU PUT INTO THIS. AND THE VERY REAL PROBLEMS THAT SOME OF OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE FACING. AND THE VERY REAL DYNAMIC OF NOT BEING ABLE TO PAY BACK RENT AND KNOWING. WHEN THE MORATORIUM ENDS THEY'RE GOING TO BE AFFECTED- THIS HOPEFULLY WILL RELIEVE THEM OF THAT PRESSURE AND LET PEOPLE STARTED NEIL IN SO. THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS AND- ASSUME IT'S BEEN MOVED BECAUSE IT HAS NOT YET I'D BE HAPPY TO WITH THE BILL. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. RIGHT THE WITH THE MESSAGE TO YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU LET ME UP FOR START BY- BY THANKING- THE CHAIR AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH MY COMMITTEE AND IN PARTICULAR FOR WORKING WITH LEADERSHIP LEADERSHIP STAFF I WANT TO THANK THE MAJORITY LEADER- THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT CAME TOGETHER VERY QUICKLY- IN ENGAGEMENT WITH. OUR FELLOW SENATORS AND OUR GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND UST APPRECIATE HOW MUCH WORK HAS GONE INTO THIS IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS I DO WANNA RESPOND TO A COUPLE OF POINTS THAT WERE RAISED ACROSS THE AISLE IT IS TRUE THAT WE HAVE NOT SEEN. THE WAVE OF ACTIONS THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT AND THAT IS BECAUSE WE HAVE PUT THESE PROTECTIONS AND THAT IS BECAUSE WHEN THE COURT- MORATORIUM ENDED LAST SUMMER WE MOVE FORTY B. THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT IT IS BECAUSE- AND- I THINK BEFORE OUR CALL THE CAME INTO THIS COMMITTEE HEARING I'D MENTION A COUPLE THE STATISTICS THAT JUST THIS MONTH ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIA RENTAL HOUSEHOLDS REPORTED TO THE CENSUS. SLIDER NO CONFIDENCE IN THEIR ABILITY TO PAY THE NEXT MONTH'S RENT THE RECENT POLICY LIKE ANALYSIS NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE BEHIND ON THEIR RENT AND THEIR STATISTICS ON HOW FAR THEY ARE BEHIND ON THE RENT WE KNOW THAT WHILE NOT EVERYONE IS STRUGGLING AT THIS MOMENT WE STILL HAVE MANY CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE BEHIND- AND LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT MONIES HAVING GONE OUT FIRST OF ALL. IT IS TRUE A VERY SMALL FRACTION OF CHECKS HAVE ACTUALLY GOTTEN IN THE HANDS OF STRUGGLING TENANTS AND LANDLORDS BUT MANY FOLKS OF APPLIED THEIR APPLICATIONS ARE LITERALLY PENDING AND SO THE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW WE WOULD ALLOW THE ACTIONS TO START AND THREE DAYS WHILE FOLKS ARE WAITING TO SEE WHETHER THEIR APPLICATIONS WILL BE APPROVED I THINK WOULD BE CHALLENGING- I WANT TO JUST TAKE A MOMENT BECAUSE I'VE BEEN ASKED A LOT WHY THE DISBURSEMENT HAS BEEN SO CHALLENGING. IT'S BEEN A NUMBER OF REASONS- FIRST OF ALL THIS IS A NEW PROGRAM IT WAS JUST SET UP A FEW MONTHS AGO WE ALL KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO SET UP NEW PROGRAMS PARTICULARLY PROGRAMS THAT HAVE CONFLICTING AND SHIFTING REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE COMING DOWN FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FROM THE STATE GOVERNMENT AND FOR MANY JURISDICTIONS AROUND CALIFORNIA SO FEDERAL STATE LOCAL PROVISIONS. THERE HAVE BEEN CHALLENGES WHEN IT COMES TO EDUCATING MILLIONS OF TENANTS AND LANDLORDS CHALLENGES AROUND LANGUAGE ACCESS CHALLENGES AROUND THE DIGITAL DIVIDE- AND CHALLENGES FRANKLY IN THE COMPLICATED APPLICATION THAT HAS JUST BEEN STREAMLINED AGAIN THIS PAST MONTH SO THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT HAVE LED TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS WE'RE SITTING ON OVER FOUR BILLION DOLLARS OF RENTAL ASSISTANCE. THAT COULD GO TO FOLKS WERE STRUGGLING AND AGAIN THE IDEA THAT WE WOULD TURN ON THE FICTION SPIGOT IN THREE DAYS- WHEN WE COULD HELP THESE FOLKS IS NOT ONE THAT I THINK MAKES SENSE- I KNOW OUR COLLEAGUES. ACROSS THE AISLE TALKED ABOUT HOW WE SHOULD FOCUS ON PROVIDING RELIEF FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT AND- THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT. THIS BILL ENVISIONS THIS BILL ENVISIONS THAT POTENTIALLY IN THREE MONTHS ON SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH. EVICTIONS WILL BEGIN AGAIN. AND WHAT IT ALSO SAYS IS THERE ARE PROTECTIONS. FOR TENANTS WHO HAVEN'T GOTTEN THE FINANCIAL SYSTEMS THAT THEY MIGHT. REQUIRE THEIR PROTECTIONS WHEN OF ACTION START TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND THAT IS- WERE REALLY LITERALLY TRYING TO ENVISION WHAT- WHAT WAS SUGGESTED AND HOW WE SHOULD STRUCTURE THIS. I KNOW TERE'S ALSO BEEN SOME SUGGESTION THAT THERE ARE TENANTS OUT THERE WHO- COULD AFFORD TO PAY- BUT IF NOT IN A FEW THINGS I WOULD JUST LIKE TO MENTION. IS AT THIS MOMENT IF A TENANT- IF THE TENANT SIGNS. A DOCUMENT SAYING% THAT THEY'VE EXPERIENCED A COVERED HARDSHIP- THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE EVICTED. THEY SIGNED UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY. WHICH MEANS THAT THEY COULD BE PROSECUTED FOR FRAUD IF THEY'RE RELYING. THIS BILL AB EIGHT THIRTY TWO ALSO ENVISIONS THAT THERE MIGHT BE TENANTS WHO LEAVE THEIR HOMES BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PAY AND IF THAT HAPPENS. LANDLORDS HAVE THE ABILITY TO APPLY FOR FUNDING AND RECEIVE THAT FUNNY THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT. ADVOCATES FOR LANDLORDS VERY MUCH WANTED AS PART OF THIS. ALSO MENTION IF IT TURNS OUT. THAT A TENANT IS ABLE TO PAY. OUR WE HAVE MADE IT EASIER THROUGH THE BILLS THAT WE'VE PASSED TO ALLOW LANDLORDS TO BRING. A SMALL CLAIMS ACTIONS WHICH ARE CHEAPER WHICH DON'T REALLY REQUIRE- YOU TO LAWYER UP. IN ORDER TO- TO- MAKE SURE THAT YOU RECEIVE THE UNPAID RENT AT- AND IF FULLER GETS A MONEY JUDGMENT. A TENANTS WAGES CAN BE GARNISHED FUNDS CAN BE WITHDRAWN FROM THEIR BANK ACCOUNTS AGAIN TO ENSURE THAT. WITH THE INSTANCE OF FOLKS WHO- WHO ARE NOT OF THE LOWER INCOME BRACKETS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- THAT THERE IS- THERE IS RECOURSE THERE BUT I WOULD JUST SUGGEST THAT ALL THE DATA SHOWS. THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF TENANTS WHO ARE INSIGNIFICANT RENTALS AT THIS POINT. MAKE BELOW 80% OF THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME WHICH WOULD MEAN THAT THERE WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE FUNDING THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT- LET ME JUST END- WITH OUR STARTED WHICH IS. WHICH IS TO SAY. AT THIS VERY MOMENT WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS THAT ARE. BEHIND ON THEIR RENT THE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW WE WOULD TURN ON ADDICTIONS WHEN WE'VE GOT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO BE ABLE TO SYSTEM. WE WOULD SERIOUSLY UNDERMINE THEIR CHANCES OF US BEING ABLE TO HELP GETTING THEM BACK ON THEIR FEET AND SO WITH THAT COLLEAGUES AGAIN. REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE ENGAGEMENT ON THIS THERE BEEN MANY ROBUST CONVERSATIONS- IN RECENT WEEKS ON EXACTLY WHAT TO DO HERE- THIS MAY NOT BE PERFECT BUT IT REPRESENTS THAT BALANCE OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO MOVE THINGS FORWARD. GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW AT THIS TIME AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK HER AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER TO ON AB EIGHT THIRTY TWO WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND.
