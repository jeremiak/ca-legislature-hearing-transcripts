MS AGUIAR-CURRY I THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS SB FIVE TEN REQUIRES HEALTH PLANS INSURERS TO COVER COVER NINETEEN TESTING AND VACCINATION. WITHOUT COST SHARING FOR PRIOR AUTHORIZATION FROM BOTH IN NETWORK AND OUT OF NETWORK PROVIDERS DURING THE FEDERAL PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY BECAUSE MY COVERT NINETEEN. THESE PROTECTIONS REMAIN FOR SERVICES PROVIDED BY IN NETWORK PROVIDERS FOLLOWING THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE FEDERAL PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. THIS BILL ALSO PROHIBITS BALANCE BILLING BY PROVIDERS FOR COVERT NINETEEN TESTING IMMUNIZATIONS EVEN AFTER THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY EXPIRES. THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THIS PANDEMIC HAVE LED TO A FRAMEWORK THAT THIS BILL PUTS IN PLACE THAT WOULD ALLOW FEDERALLY APPROVED TESTING IN IMMUNIZATIONS WITH NO COST SHARING FOR A FUTURE PANDEMIC. SB FIVE TEN IS A MUCH NEEDED BILL BECAUSE OF FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES HAVE SET OUT EVOLVING AND SOMETIMES CONFLICTING GUIDANCE WHICH HAS MADE IT CONFUSING FOR PATIENTS. AND PROVIDERS TO KNOW WHEN THEY WILL BE CHARGED. THE SCIENCE IS CLEAR. TESTING SYMPTOMATIC AND ASYMPTOMATIC INDIVIDUALS ALONG WITH THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO COVER NINETEEN IS CRUCIAL TO STOPPING THE SPREAD. WE ARE STILL LIVING IN THIS PANDEMIC WE CANNOT LOSE SIGHT OF ENSURING EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO COPE NINETEEN TESTING AND VACCINATIONS WITH NO OUT OF POCKET COSTS.

STRELOW YOU MAIL THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES SB SIX SIXTY HELPS MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTORAL PROCESS I RESPECTFULLY ASK PRIVATE. THANK YOU MR LOW MR GALLAGHER. YOUR RESIDENCE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS AYE AYE RISE TO OPPOSE SB SIX SIXTY. YOU KNOW THERE ARE THINGS WRONG WITH OUR INITIATIVE PROCESS. THERE ARE THINGS WE NEED TO FIX ABOUT THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTIONS. THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM. THIS IS GETTING IN THE WAY OF GRASSROOTS ACTIVISM OF PEOPLE GOING OUT EVERYDAY CITIZENS. PETITIONING GETTING SIGNATURES TO GET INITIATIVES ON THE BALLOT. AND YES WHEN YOU DO WORK. WHEN YOU DO THIS VITAL WORK YOU SHOULD GET PAID FOR IT- AND SO. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH PEOPLE GETTING PAID TO GET SIGNATURES TO SUPPORT INITIATIVE THAT PEOPLE EITHER SIGN IF THEY SUPPORTED OR NOT IT'S UP TO THE CITIZEN IS NOT UP TO THE PERSON GATHERING THE SIGNATURES THE CITIZEN THEMSELVES WHO DECIDED THIS IS A WORTHWHILE INITIATIVE. BUT TO TALK ABOUT THIS IS AS- AS INTEGRITY WHEN WE DON'T EVEN HAVE VOTER ID IN THIS STATE. TO TALK ABOUT THIS ISN'T INTEGRITY A MEASURE WHEN WE STILL ALLOW THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO WRITE BIASED TITLES AND SUMMARIES OF INITIATIVES THEY COMPLETELY MISS REP MISREPRESENT. WHAT THOSE INITIATIVES DO. AND WE HAD SEVERAL OF THOSE. AND TIME AND TME AGAIN WE BROUGHT THAT BILL TO ALLOW FOR AN UNBIASED INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF THAILAND SUMMARIES OF THE TITLES AND SUMMARIES ACCURATELY REFLECT. WHAT IS BEING VOTED ON THIS THIS BODY BILL TO DOWN BUT ANYTHING ABOUT GRASSROOTS ACTIVISM AND I FULLY EXPECT IT NEXT SESSION WILL SEE CHANGES TO THE RECALL RULES RIGHT. BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE IT WHEN CITIZENS ACTUALLY EXERCISE THEIR- RIGHTS THEIR RIGHTS MR BERMAN STATE LEADERS WHEN I ASKED MY FRIEND FROM NICOLAS SPEAK TO THE MERITS OF THIS BILL AND NOT ANY OTHER CONCERNS OR CONSPIRACY THEORIES HE HAS. I'M SORRY MISTER BURMA PLEASE RESTATE A POINT OF ORDER I ASK THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM NICHOLAS SPEAK TO THE MERITS AND FACTS OF THIS BILL. AND NOT ANYTHING ELSE THAT MIGHT YOU MIGHT BE WORRIED ABOUT. POINT OF ORDER IS WELL TAKEN MR GALLAGHER PLEASE SECOND FINAL COMMENTS TO THE MERITS OF THE BILL BEFORE THE HOUSE. WELL FIRST OF ALL IT'S POINT OF ORDER NOT OBJECTION WE ARE IN THE COURTROOM. I HAVE BEEN IN A COURT ROOM THOUGH ACTUALLY. I HAVE BEEN IN COURT MISS. WORLD I'VE ROLLED ON THE POINT OF ORDER. BUT WE ARE SPEAKING TO THE MERITS OF VOTER INTEGRITY. IN OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT. I REALIZE I'VE TOUCHED A NERVE. WITH MY COLLEAGUE BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT IS VERY TRUE. THAT WE REJECTED BALLOT INTEGRITY. MEASURES IN HIS COMMITTEE- AND WE KNOW THAT IS VERY TRUE THAT THIS BODY HASN'T STOOD UP. TO STOP CHANGES TO OUR ELECTION LAW. BY A GOVERNOR WITHOUT THE LEGISLATURE SUPPORT I REALIZE THAT TOUCHES A NERVE BECAUSE HE HASN'T HAD THE COURAGE TO STAND UP TO THOSE THINGS. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS MISS MISS BIRKHEAD IS A MINIMUM ORDER I WOULD ASK THE GENTLEMAN FROM NICOLAS PLEASE NOT ATTACK A FELLOW MEMBER ON THE FLOOR. MS BURKE A HEN. THE POINT OF ORDER IS WELL TAKEN MR GALLAGHER I WOULD ASK THAT YOU. AGAIN CAN FIND YOUR COMMENTS TO THE MERITS OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE BILL BEFORE THE HOUSE. THE POINT THAT I'M MAKING AND THAT BOTHERS SOME. IS THAT IT IS A MISREPRESENTATION TO ATTACK THE CITIZENS MOVEMENTS THAT ARE PUTTING INITIATIVES THEY'RE PUTTING RECALLS ON THE BALLOT INSTEAD OF ATTACKING THE PROCESS. AND THE MISREPRESENTATIONS THAT HAVE HAPPENED RIGHT HERE IN THIS BODY THAT HAVE HAPPENED RIGHT HERE IN OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO PROTECT OUR VOTING SYSTEM TO PROTECT OUR INITIATIVE AND THE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE HAVE ACCURATE. INFORMATION THAT THEY'RE VOTING ON. AND TO ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF THE BALLOT BOX. THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD BE WORKING ON TO ME THIS ATTACKS THE CITIZENS. WHO HAVE EVERY RIGHT. TO PUT ON INITIATIVES TO CALL FOR RECALLS FOR REFERENDUMS. ATTACKING THAT CITIZEN. THE MOST PRO DEMOCRACY PROCESS THAT WE HAVE IS THE WRONG THING TO DO AND I URGE A NO VOTE ON THIS BILL. I SEEING NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION. OR DEBATE. THANK YOU FOR THE JOLT OF ADRENALINE. MR LOW YOU MAY CLOSE IF YOU WISH. I RESPECTFULLY ASK HER ABOUT. TOOK OVER THERE ALL THE RESULT.
