BUT I WAS THOUGH THAT TYLER IS A GOOD FRIEND AND NOW HIM THE BEFORE HE WAS ELECTED AND- HE'S- HE'S ALWAYS BEEN DEDICATED TO HIS COMMUNITY BUT I WOULD SAY THAT NO ONE WILL EVER TAKE THE TITLE FROM TYLER A BEING THE CHEAPEST MEMBER IN THE ASSEMBLY AND- AND HE'LL EVEN AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE'S EVER GONNA DISPUTE THAT EITHER- I THINK THE NUMBER OF TIMES I HAVE GONE TO DINNER WITH TYLER.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS WHERE'S WHERE'S TYLER. ALL RIGHT. WELL I WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY GIVE YOU THE DIGNITY TO LOOK AT YOU FACE TO FACE. I ACTUALLY HEARD ABOUT TYLER EARLY ON- WHENI WAS A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER- BACK IN MY EARLY TWENTIES. AND THE REASON WHY IS BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY OF US LIKE THAT. BECAUSE WE WERE TOO YOUNG OR DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH EXPERIENCE. THE RED SHIRTS AND TIES MEMBERS HAD CERTAIN TIES ARE OLDER THAN US. OR THAT WE WERE QUALIFIED. OR THAT OUR JUDGMENT SHOULD BE QUESTIONED. AND THERE WAS THIS GUY NAMED TYLER DEEP WHO IS SIMILARLY ELECTED AT THE AGE OF TWENTY THREE. AND THEN WENT ON TO CITY COUNCIL MEMBER AND VICE MAYOR. CONTINUE TO SERVICE AS A MEMBER OF THIS DISTINGUISHED BODY IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE. AND MANY OF US KNOW THAT PERHAPS TYLER YOU'RE AHEAD OF YOUR TIME FOR YOUR OWN DISTRICT. BUT YOU'VE ALWAYS SOUGHT OUT TO ENSURE THAT THE LOOK FOR BIPARTISANSHIP AND HAVING AN OPEN DOOR. ESPECIALLY UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS IS A HYPER POLITICIZED WORLD. AND I WANT TO GET TO KNOW TYLER EVEN THAT MUCH MORE AND SO I VISITED IN IN HIS DISTRICTACTUALLY CRASHED ONE OF HIS PARTY'S. AND WHICH HAD A ROOM FULL COMPLETELY FULL. OF SUPPORTERS. AND IT WAS LIKE. IT WAS ALMOST GOD LIKE IN THAT ROOM- BECAUSE PEOPLE WANTED PICTURES WITH HIM AND- YOU COULD SEE A SENSE OF DEEP RESPECT. AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THAT OF THE PARTNERSHIP HE ALSO HAS TAKEN A LEAP OF FAITHIN REPRESENTING THE SENSE OF INTEGRITY THAT HE ASKED HIMSELF. AS THE FIRST IN HIS EXTENDED FAMILY TO GRADUATE FROM AN AMERICAN UNIVERSITY. AND IT'S COMING TO THIS COUNTRY AND PUBLICLY STATED THAT. HE AND HIS FAMILY WERE PUBLIC BENEFICIARIES. OF WELFARE AND OF THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET THAT WE HAVE CREATED FOR ALL PEOPLE. AND THAT WHEN THE CURRENT OCCUPANT OF THE WHITE HOUSE SUPPORTED A POLICY THE CHANGE IN POLICY. TO HAVE TAKEN SELECT. CERTAIN TYPES OF IMMIGRANTS AND REFUGEES. HE SPOKE OUT PUBLICLY. AND WAS THERE FOR CAN BACKLASH AS WELL. BUT AGAIN MEMBERS IN THIS ERA IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE SPEAK TRUTH TO POWER. AND OFTENTIMES THAT OUR OWN POLITICAL PERIL TO WHICH WE WILL BE MISSING YOU TYLER. BUT AGAIN KNOWING THAT WE SERVE WITH YOU OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. YOUR SERVICE OF OVER A DECADE- YOU WILL HAVE MANY MORE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE SO. I JUST WANTED.

OF STARTING WITH A FILE ITEM NUMBER ONE FORTY NINE THE CLERK WILL READ SENATE BILL TWELVE TWENTY BY CENTER OF BERGEN ACCOLADE OF PEACE OFFICERS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER PARA QUE HAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER COLLEAGUES TODAY I'M PRESENTING SP TWELVE TWENTY ON BEHALF OF SENATOR UMBERG. WHICH CODIFIES IN CLARIFIES CASE LAW BY ESTABLISHING A STATEWIDE STANDARD FOR THE COMPLIANCE OF BRADY OBLIGATIONS. BY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. UNDER BRADY VERSUS MARYLAND THE SUPREME COURT HELD THAT THE PROSECUTION HAS A CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATION. NOT ONLY TO DISCLOSE WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN TO PROSECUTORS. BUT ALSO TO LEARN OF ANY SUCH INFORMATION THAT IS KNOWN TO LAW ENFORCEMENT GENERALLY. INCLUDING MATTERS RELATED TO WITNESS CREDIBILITY EVEN OUT OF PEACE OFFICERS AND TO MAKE THAT INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE DEFENSE. ALTHOUGH BRADY AND SUBSEQUENT DECISIONS HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE FOR MANY DECADES. SOME LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARE NOT ABLE TO FULLY OBSERVE ITS REQUIREMENTS ARE COMPLIED THROUGH. ORGANIZATIONAL POLICY OR PRACTICE BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF CLARITY AND CONFUSING PATCHWORK A VERY POLICIES ACROSS PROSECUTORIAL JURISDICTIONS. IN CURRENT LAW CENTERED STICTION PROVIDE A ROBUST AD FAIR PROCESS FOR WHEN OFFICES ARE PUT ON THE BRADY LIST. AND ALSO OFFERED. NOTICE TO THE OFFICERS BEFORE OR AFTER THEY ARE PUT ON THIS LIST. HOWEVER SOME JURISDICTIONS HAVE NO PROCESS WHATSOEVER TO NOTIFY THE OFFICERS AT ALL. ANOTHER PROBLEM IS THAT BRADY DOES NOT PROVIDE A BRIGHT LINE RULE ON THE TYPES OF INFORMATION THAT MUST BE REVEALED. AND APARTMENTS CAN HAVE DIFFICULTY ESTABLISHING PROTOCOLS AND COMPILING BREEDING MATERIALS FROM RECORDS THE BABY'S BED SPREAD. THROUGHOUT A DEPARTMENT. IN LOSS JURISDICTION INTER THIS PROBLEM BY PUTTING FOLKS ON THE BRADY LIST YOU SHOULD NOT BE ON IT WELL OTHER JURISDICTIONS INTERPRET BRADY TOO NARROWLY. FAILING TO CAPTURE OFFICERS WHO SHOULD BE ON IT. FOR ALL THESE REASONS SB TWELVE TWENTY AIMS TO FOUR STRIKE A DELICATE BALANCE BETWEEN PROSECUTORS CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATIONS AND DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS FOR PEACE OFFICERS. BECAUSE AS IT STANDS AT THISMOMENT DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND DEFENSE COUNSEL DON'T HAVE COMPLETE ACCESS TO CONSTITUTIONALLY MANDATED EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE. AND WITHOUT THIS INFORMATION AVAILABLE PROSECUTORS AND COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENDANTS ARE UNAWARE THIS PURPOSE CONTACT FOR THE OFFICERS TESTIFYING IN THE CASE. THEREFORE SB TWELVE TWENTY REQUIRES THESE AGENCIES TO MAINTAIN PERSONAL RECORDS OF PEACE OFFICERS TO PROVIDE PROSECUTING AGENCIES A LIST OF NAMES AND BADGE NUMBERS OF OFFICERS EMPLOYED BY THE AGENCY. IN THE FIVE YEARS PRECEDING THEIR REQUEST WHO MEET SPECIFIED CRITERIA IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE BRADY CASE AND SUBSEQUENT DECISIONS.

THIS BILL DOES NOT RAISE TAXES IT JUST CREATES ROOM UNDER THE STATEWIDE CAP THE COUNTY AND CITIES WITHIN THE COUNTY WOULD STILL BE. TO SEEK VOTER APPROVAL FOR ANY ADDITIONAL SALES TAX MEASURE. CITIES AND COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE ARE RESPONSIBLE WITH PROVIDING THEIR CONSTITUENTS WITH THE NUMBER OF SUPPORTIVE SERVICES TO ADDRESS LOCAL NEEDS. THIS INCLUDES POLICE AND FIRE SERVICES HOMELESS SERVICES AND PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES. THESE SERVICES ARE ESPECALLY IMPORTANT DURING TIMES OF CRISIS DO TO COPE WITH CITIES IN CONTRA COSTA ARE ESTIMATING LOSSES IN REVENUE OF UP TO EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. THE COUNTY ESTIMATES A NEARLY ONE HUNDRED MILLION REDUCTION IN ESTIMATED REVENUE YET THE NEED FOR PUBLIC SERVICES IS LIKELY TO RISE IN THE AFTERMATH OF THIS PANDEMIC. THIS BILL IS A REASONABLE MEASURE TO PROVIDE AN AVENUE FOR RAISING NECESSARY FUNDING IN THE COUNTY AGAIN ANY MEASURES FOR ADDITIONAL SALES TAXES WOULD STILL REQUIRE VOTER APPROVAL TO INCREASE SALES TAX IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY.

THIS IS WRONG AND OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY SHOULD NOT LOOK LIKE ARMED FORCES ESPECIALLY WHEN THE TWO GROUPS ARE VASTLY DIFFERENT ROLES IN AMERICAN SOCIETY FURTHERMORE OUTSIDE OF TACTICAL OPERATIONS WHICH TO BE CLEAR ARE EXEMPT FROM THIS BILL. THERE'S NO REASON POLICE OFFICERS SHOULD BE WEARING A UNIFORM BUT FOR CONCEALMENT WHILE ON DUTY FOR EVERY DAY PATROL CRIMES OF THE PRUSSIAN OR IN IT IN AN EVENT. OF ANY EVENT NOT ONLY ARE MILITARY STYLE UNIFORMS THE INAPPROPRIATE GEAR BUT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE MERE PRESENCE OF THEM CAN INVITE FEAR WITHIN THE COMMUNITY THAT POLICE OFFICERS ARE SERVING.

AND WE ARE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THE EXPERIENCES OF INNOCENT YOUTH WHO HAVE BEEN PRESSURED INTO GIVING FALSE CONFESSIONS AND HAVE HAD THEIR LIVES DEVASTATED. AS A CONSEQUENCE. ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL REGISTRY OF EXONERATIONS SINCE 198936% OF PEOPLE WHO FALSELY CONFESSED TO A CRIME. WERE LATER EXONERATED. WHO WERE LATER EXONERATED WERE UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN THIS BILL PROTECTS ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S YOU. AND HELPS BUILD TRUST IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. THE LEGISLATURE PASSED THE SAME BILL IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WITH SB TEN FIFTY TWO BY SENATOR LARA. IN THE MEASURE WAS ULTIMATELY VETOED. BY GOVERNOR BROWN. THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A WEAKER VERSION OF THIS BILL IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHICH WAS AMENDED TO YOUTH UNDER THE AGE OF SIXTEEN.

THE OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL ARGUES THAT WE SHOULD WAIT TO HEAR THE RESULTS OF THIS. REVIEW BUT WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO WAIT FOR SOMETHING THAT WE ALREADY KNOW YOUNG PEOPLE MUST KNOW THEIR RIGHTS AND THEY SHOULD NOT BE ALONE WHEN BEING INTERROGATED. THIS BILL DOES NOT FORBID INNOCENT TEENS FROM ENGAGING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT IT WOULD NOT MAKE THEIR STATEMENTS AND ADMISSIBLE AND IT WOULD NOT PREVENT LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM USING CONFESSIONS TO ACCOMPLISH THEIR WORK.

CURRENTLY DIRECT TO CONSUMER GENETIC TESTING COMPANIES ARE NOT REGULATED UNDER THE HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT WHICH SETS STRICT GUIDELINES. FOR HOW GENETIC DATA SHOULD BE HANDLED. DUE TO THE LACK OF PROTECTIONS OUR OWN U. S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE HAS ASKED SERVICE MEMBERS TO NOT USE DIRECT TO CONSUMER GENETIC TESTING SERVICES. TO THIRD PARTIES ABILITY TO EXPLOIT THESE COMPANIES DATABASES. SB NINE EIGHTY WOULD ADDRESS THIS CHALLENGE BY CREATING STRICT GUIDELINES THAT ALLOW CONSUMERS TO CONTROL THEIR GENETIC DATA WHILE ALSO ESTABLISHING CIVIL PENALTIES FOR COMPANIES. THAT IMPROPERLY DISCLOSE SUCH DATA. THE BILL STRIKES THE APPROPRIATE BALANCE IN PROTECTING THE PRIVACY OF INDIVIDUALS AND ALLOWING FOR CONSUMERS TO STILL ACCESS GENETIC TESTING PRODUCTS. WHICH IS WHY IT SUPPORTED BY BOTH COMPANIES SUCH AS ANCESTRY AND TWENTY THREE IN ME AS WELL AS THEACLU AND THE COALITION FOR GENETIC DATA PRIVACY. BY PASSING THIS BILL CALIFORNIA WOULD BE CODIFYING MANY OF THE AGREED UPON BEST PRACTICES AND MAKING IT CLEAR THAT CONSUMERS SHOULD CONTROLLED GENETIC DATA WITHOUT FEAR OF EXPLOITATION BY THIRD PARTIES.

FILE ITEM THREE OH FOUR EIGHTY NINE SEVENTY NINE THE CLERK WILL READ SOMETHING ONLINE SEVENTY NINE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER HOLDEN ANOTHER'S FACULTATIVE CORPORATIONS. HOLDING YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I RISE TONIGHT TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL NINE SEVENTY NINE. AB NINE SEVEN NINE HAS BEEN A PART OF A LARGER EFFORT TO ENSURE PEOPLE OF COLOR. HAVE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO UPWARD MOBILITY AND AMERICAN SOCIETY. WHEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA SAID IN A WAY SO WHEN I WHICH HERE'S THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS LATINO AND BLACK CAUCUS. WE WORK TOGETHER TO ADDRESS RACIAL AND GENDER DISPARITIES AT TECH COMPANIES IN SILICON VALLEY. THAT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. DESPITE OUR EFFORTS AND DATA ILLUSTRATING THE LACK OF DIVERSITY DATING BACK TO TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE OF COLOR BEING HIRED AND PROMOTED HAS NOT CHANGED. UNFORTUNATELY THIS PROBLEM IS NOT UNIQUE TO TECH COMPANIES. CORPORATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE CONDUCTED REVIEWS OF THEIR WORKFORCE AN INMATE PROMISES TO INCREASE DIVERSITY. FOLLOWING THE SUCCESS OF SB EIGHT TWENTY SIX ASSEMBLY BRO NINE SEVENTY NINE REQUIRE A MINIMUM OF ONE DIRECTOR BERMAN UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITY ON ALL BOARDS OF PUBLICLY TRADED CORPORATIONS HEADQUARTERED IN CALIFORNIA BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE BILL WILL ALSO REQUIRE A MINIMUM OF TWO DIRECTORS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES FOR BOARDS THAT HAVE FIVE TO EIGHT DIRECTORS AND A MINIMUM OF THREE DIRECTORS FOR BOARDS WITH MORE THAN NINE DIRECTORS BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. WELL CALIFORNIA PRIDES ITSELF ON BEING AN ECONOMIC POWERHOUSE. AND HAVING A MAJORITY MINORITY POPULATION. CORPORATIONS DO NOT REFLECT THE VAST CULTURAL WEALTH OF THE STATE. FOR EXAMPLE THE TOP TEN CALIFORNIA BANKS ONLY 30% OF DIRECTORS ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR. THIS STATISTIC PALES IN COMPARISON TO THE 67% OF CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION PEOPLE OF COLOR. ON AVERAGE BLACK AND LATINO TECH EMPLOYEES MAKE LESS THAN 10% OF WORKERS AT PREMIER TECH COMPANIES. THIS PERCENTAGE IS DISPROPORTIONATE TO THE ROUGHLY 20% OF COMPUTER SCIENCE GRADUATES THAT ARE BLACK AND LATINO. THE FACE OF THOSE THE CONTROL WEALTH AND OUR STATE HAS NOT CHANGED EVEN HOME REPORTS SHOW THAT DIVERSITY ON CORPORATE BOARDS BENEFITS THE CORPORATION. WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THE RACIAL INJUSTICE AND INEQUALITY IN OUR SOCIETY. WE MUST BE INTENTIONAL. PEOPLE OF COLOR MUST HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE WERE OVERWHELMING AMOUNT OF WEALTH IS BASED. ESPECIALLY IN A STATE AS DIVERSE AS CALIFORNIA. EIGHTY NINE SEVENTY NINE CENTS A FRAMEWORK FOR CALIFORNIA TO ENGAGE IN THIS CRITICAL AND TIMELY ISSUE. THIS BILL IS THE PRIMARY OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS. LATINO CAUCUS API CAUCUS AND LGBT CAUCUS I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU MR HOLDEN MISS GARCIA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE REAR CHAMBER YES THANK YOU OF THANK YOU MEMBERS I'M HERE SURPRISED OR NOT THEIR BABY. NINE SEVENTY NINE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION. CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION IS 39% LATINO BUT 87% OF CALIFORNIAN CORPORATE BOARDS DO NOT HAVE LATINO REPRESENTATION. AB I MAKE UP A COMBINED 60% OF THE POPULATION YET ONLY THREE POINT FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA. EVERYTHING USC REYES AND EQUITY CENTERS STUDY ALSO SHOWS THAT BLACKS TEND TO. BE EMPLOYED IN THE LOWEST PAIN AT LEAST POWERFUL POSITIONS WE MUST AND WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT. THERE IS ALSO SHOW THAT RATIONS WITH MORE THEIR BIRTH AND EQUITABLE BOARDS IMPROVE COMPANY GOVERNANCE AND HAVE BETTER DECISION MAKING. WHICH LEADS TO A BETTER COMPANY OVER ALL. THE ONE QUESTION WE HAVE AN ANSWER IS WHY NOT WHY WE CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS WE'VE SEEN REACHED THE RACIAL RECKONING. TRIGGERED BY THE KILLING OF GEORGE FLOYD. THE PUBLIC ENTITIES TO PROTEST THAT AND DEMANDED THAT WE TEAR DOWN RACIAL BIASES. IN ALL OF OUR INSTITUTIONS. THE MESSAGE IS CLEAR AND THE LEGISLATURE MUST DO ALL THEY CAN TO PRIORITIZE EQUALITY AND EQUITY NOW. WE CAN NO LONGER WAIT TO ANSWER THE CRIES FOR JUSTICE. FOR THOSE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER MISTER DAVID CHIU YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AS THE CHAIR THE API LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS IN THE JOINT AUTHORS OF THIS BILL. I URGE YOUR SUPPORT. IN RECENT MONTHS RACIAL DISPARITIES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED IN EVERY ASPECT OF OUR COUNTRY. THIS BILL RECOGNIZES THAT LEADERSHIP ON OUR CORPORATE BOARDS MUST BE DIVERSE TO GUIDE CALIFORNIA COMPANIES TO MAKE STRATEGIC DECISIONS. THAT ARE INNOVATIVE AND SERVE ALL CALIFORNIANS. AT THIS TIME ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF FORTUNE ONE THOUSAND COMPANIES DO NOT HAVE A SINGLE ASIAN AMERICAN PERSPECTIVE IN THE BOARDROOM. IN THE TECH INDUSTRY AND SILICON VALLEY THE PERCENTAGE OF API EXECUTIVES IS ONLY A LITTLE MORE THAN HALF OF THE PERCENTAGE OF API'S IN THE OVERALL WORK FORCE. THE LARGEST NEGATIVE DISPARITY BETWEEN THE REPRESENTATION OF EXECUTIVES AND WORKFORCE AMONG ALL ETHNIC GROUPS. IN CALIFORNIA RECENT STUDIES SHOW THAT ASIAN AMERICANS ARE LEAST LIKELY TO BE PROMOTED TO MANAGEMENT AND EXECUTIVE POSITIONS. OR AT THE HISTORIC INFLECTION POINT IN THE SOCIETY WE NEED TO RISE TO THE CHALLENGE ANSWER THE CALL AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY URGE FOR YOUR OTHER. THANK YOU MISTER TO. SEEING AND HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE ON THE MATTER MR HOLDEN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU. THIRTY MINUTES LATER. I WOULD SIMPLY JUST ASK FOR YOUR ARRIVAL.

HOW CAN WE MAKE A CHANGE AND- THERE'S AN EFFORT UNDERWAY UNDER THE DOME. TO FIND WAYS TO CREATE MORE EFFECTIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY. AND HOW EXCESSIVE FORCE IS HANDLED. WE ALSO HAVE THE ISSUE PLAYING OUT. IN ORDER CITIZENS. AND AS WE THOUGHT ABOUT HOW WE COULD MAKE THIS BILL AFFECTED AND MEET THE TIMES. I RECOGNIZE THAT. WHEN YOU LOOK. A DEDICATION GAP. AND THE BLACK AND BROWN CHILDREN FALLING BETWEEN. THE GAP. WHEN YOU LOOK AT MINORITY BUSINESSES I HAVE A HARD TIME GETTING ACCESS TO CAPITAL.
