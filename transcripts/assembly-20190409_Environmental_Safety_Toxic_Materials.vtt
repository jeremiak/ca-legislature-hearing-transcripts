WITH THE CATASTROPHIC EFFECTS OF

00:28:58.403 --> 00:29:00.705
LITHIUM ION BATTERIES I'VE GOT

00:29:00.772 --> 00:29:03.108
SEVERAL EXAMPLES HERE -- OF THE

00:29:03.174 --> 00:29:05.477
THE GROWING CONCERN HERE THIS IS

00:29:05.543 --> 00:29:06.878
THIS IS THE BEFORE THIS IS THE

00:29:06.945 --> 00:29:09.681
AFTER -- WHEN THESE MATERIALS

00:29:09.747 --> 00:29:12.517
ARE NOT HANDLED RESPONSIBLY --

00:29:12.584 --> 00:29:13.318
THEY CAN.

00:29:13.384 --> 00:29:16.020
GO INTO THE HIGHLY MECHANIZED

00:29:16.087 --> 00:29:17.989
EQUIPMENT THAT WE USE TO SORT

00:29:18.056 --> 00:29:20.525
AND PROCESS MATERIALS -- AT THAT

00:29:20.592 --> 00:29:22.961
TIME IT'S VERY COMMON FOR THAT

00:29:23.027 --> 00:29:24.829
TO GO IN BETWEEN -- THE

00:29:24.896 --> 00:29:27.432
MECHANIZED EQUIPMENT AND THE THE

00:29:27.499 --> 00:29:28.867
SAFETY.

00:29:28.933 --> 00:29:30.835
SAFETY COATINGS ARE BREACHED AND

00:29:30.902 --> 00:29:32.504
FIRE COMES OUT SO WE HAD AN

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:33.838
EIGHT AND A HALF MILLION DOLLAR

00:29:33.905 --> 00:29:37.142
FIRE ON SEPTEMBER SEVENTH OF

00:29:37.208 --> 00:29:38.109
TWENTY SIXTEEN THE PLANT WAS

00:29:38.176 --> 00:29:39.811
CLOSED FOR ALMOST FOUR MONTHS.

00:29:39.878 --> 00:29:41.045
IT TOOK ABOUT A YEAR TO GET BACK

00:29:41.112 --> 00:29:43.748
ON TRACK -- DURING THAT TIME

00:29:43.815 --> 00:29:45.049
ABOUT FIFTY WORKERS WERE

00:29:45.116 --> 00:29:46.384
FURLOUGHED DURING THE HOLIDAYS

00:29:46.451 --> 00:29:48.319
WHICH IS VERY AND FORTUNE I AM

00:29:48.386 --> 00:29:49.320
VERY HAPPY TO SAY NO ONE WAS

00:29:49.387 --> 00:29:49.587
INJURED.

00:29:49.654 --> 00:29:52.757
THEY FOLLOWED THE EVACUATION.

00:29:52.824 --> 00:29:54.959
PROCEDURES TO A TEE SO ONCE THEY

00:29:55.026 --> 00:29:56.060
REALIZE THE FIRE GOT AWAY FROM

00:29:56.127 --> 00:29:57.662
THEM THEY THEY GOT OUT OF THE

00:29:57.729 --> 00:29:59.831
PLANT WHICH WAS AMAZING -- BUT

00:29:59.898 --> 00:30:01.866
MORE TO THE POINT -- NOT ONLY IS

00:30:01.933 --> 00:30:03.201
THERE A WORKER SAFETY ISSUE

00:30:03.268 --> 00:30:05.336
INVOLVED BUT THE FACILITY ITSELF

00:30:05.403 --> 00:30:07.071
IS AT RISK AT SERIOUS RISK SO

00:30:07.138 --> 00:30:10.175
FOR US -- OR INSURANCE PROVIDER --

00:30:10.241 --> 00:30:11.442
WORKED WITH US RIGHT TO THE END

00:30:11.509 --> 00:30:12.644
THEY PAID EVERYTHING THEY WERE

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:15.246
OBLIGATED TO DO AND THEN THEY

00:30:15.313 --> 00:30:16.014
FIRED US.

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:16.948
THEY FIRED AS THEY WALKED AWAY

00:30:17.015 --> 00:30:18.116
THEY SAID WE'RE NOT GETTING IN

00:30:18.183 --> 00:30:19.350
THIS CATEGORY OF COVERAGE

00:30:19.417 --> 00:30:20.351
ANYMORE.

00:30:20.418 --> 00:30:22.420
SO WE NOW HAVE SEVEN INSURANCE

00:30:22.487 --> 00:30:24.722
COMPANIES -- PROVIDING COVERAGE

00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:26.324
WHERE WE HAD ONE BEFORE OUR

00:30:26.391 --> 00:30:29.460
PREMIUMS HAVE TRIPLED OUR OUR

00:30:29.527 --> 00:30:30.828
COVERAGE -- WILL BE VERY

00:30:30.895 --> 00:30:32.997
CHALLENGING IF THIS WERE TO

00:30:33.064 --> 00:30:34.799
HAPPEN AGAIN LET ME TELL YOU.

00:30:34.866 --> 00:30:36.634
SO I DEFINITELY WANT TO ASSURE

00:30:36.701 --> 00:30:39.170
YOU THAT WE'VE TAKEN MANY MANY --

00:30:39.237 --> 00:30:40.805
I INTERNAL STEPS WITHIN THE

00:30:40.872 --> 00:30:43.374
FACILITY TO IMPLEMENT -- FIRE

00:30:43.441 --> 00:30:45.210
SUPPRESSION EQUIPMENT HIGHER

00:30:45.276 --> 00:30:46.911
LEVEL OF TRAINING ECCENTRICITY

00:30:46.978 --> 00:30:48.213
WERE MORE PREPARED IF AND WHEN

00:30:48.279 --> 00:30:49.581
THIS HAPPENS IN THE FUTURE.

00:30:49.647 --> 00:30:51.516
BUT THE THE KEY POINT IS WITH

00:30:51.583 --> 00:30:53.585
THE PROLIFERATION OF LITHIUM ION

00:30:53.651 --> 00:30:55.453
BATTERIES IN OUR MODERN SOCIETY --

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.855
WE ARE SEEING A VERY STEEP

00:30:57.922 --> 00:30:59.357
INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF THESE

00:30:59.424 --> 00:31:00.558
MATERIALS THAT WE GET IN OUR

00:31:00.625 --> 00:31:02.093
FACILITIES AND PUTTING OUR

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:03.861
WORKERS AT RISK AND THE FACILITY

00:31:03.928 --> 00:31:05.863
AT RISK SO -- WE JUST DID A

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:07.465
COUNTY AND IT'S LITERALLY

00:31:07.532 --> 00:31:09.033
DOUBLED FROM A YEAR AGO -- WE'RE

CURRENTLY GETTING ELEVEN

00:31:10.602 --> 00:31:12.537
BATTERIES AND OUR EVERYONE OF

00:31:14.639 --> 00:31:15.340
OPPORTUNITY.

00:31:15.406 --> 00:31:16.908
AND THE BEING ON OUR SIDE OF THE

00:31:16.975 --> 00:31:19.010
FENCE -- IT'S TIME FOR ACTION

00:31:19.077 --> 00:31:20.511
WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT

00:31:20.578 --> 00:31:24.382
IT SO -- WILL NOT ONLY THREE

00:31:24.449 --> 00:31:25.617
MINUTES.

00:31:25.683 --> 00:31:27.051

00:38:08.653 --> 00:38:10.354
FIRES AND IT'S GOING TO BE AN

00:38:10.421 --> 00:38:11.889
INCREASING PROBLEM SO.

00:38:11.956 --> 00:38:12.990
I'LL BUT IN TERMS OF THAT SOME

00:38:13.057 --> 00:38:14.425
OF THE DETAILS I IDENTIFIED IN

00:38:14.492 --> 00:38:17.595
THE ANALYSIS I'M CONFIDENT WE

00:38:17.662 --> 00:38:17.928
CAN ADDRESS.

00:38:17.995 --> 00:38:20.264
VIRTUALLY ALL OF THOSE CONCERNS.

00:38:20.331 --> 00:38:23.067
ISSUES RAISED GOING FORWARD

00:38:23.134 --> 00:38:23.367
[inaudible]

00:38:23.434 --> 00:38:26.203
GOOD -- AS WITH THE A LOT OF

00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:28.305

00:38:28.372 --> 00:38:30.508
PERFECT IN THE FIRST COMMITTEE --

00:38:30.574 --> 00:38:32.543
ISSUES ARE RAISED AND THEY TAKE

00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:36.313
TIME TO WORK OUT -- SO I THINK

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:39.016
THOUGH THAT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM.

00:38:39.083 --> 00:38:40.718
EVEN WHEN YOU HAVE ONE IS GOING

00:38:40.785 --> 00:38:42.253
TO BE GETTING THE PUBLIC TO

00:38:42.319 --> 00:38:45.523

I'M JUST TALKING HERE -- BUT

00:39:00.938 --> 00:39:02.373
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT WE'RE GOING

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:05.609
TO NEED TO HAVE -- ADVERTISING --

00:39:05.676 --> 00:39:07.978

IN OUR VIEW IS UNNECESSARY SO

00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:32.976
THE SAFETY DATA PROFILE DOES NOT

00:53:33.043 --> 00:53:35.078
CHANGE BASED ON A SHADE OR COLOR

00:53:35.145 --> 00:53:37.113

TIME I DON'T THINK IT'S A

00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:49.179
PROBLEM TO REPORT IN LANGUAGE

00:55:49.245 --> 00:55:50.480
THAT TO IT SO THERE'S SOME

00:55:50.547 --> 00:55:51.548
BROADNESS IN YOUR BILL.

00:55:51.614 --> 00:55:53.116
NUMBER.

KNOW THAT.

00:55:57.721 --> 00:55:59.456
VIETNAMESE AND I MEAN WE HAD

00:55:59.522 --> 00:56:01.458
SEVERAL BILLS IN THE PAST -- AND

00:56:01.524 --> 00:56:03.293
I WANT TO THE WORK FORCE TO BE

00:56:03.359 --> 00:56:06.463
ABLE TO ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND.

00:56:06.529 --> 00:56:08.665
THE PRODUCTS THEY USE EVERYDAY

00:56:08.732 --> 00:56:11.534
NUMBER ONE NUMBER -- TWO AND

00:56:11.601 --> 00:56:12.001
THEN THE DEFINITION OF

00:56:12.068 --> 00:56:14.471
COMMERCIAL -- AND THEN ALSO A

00:56:14.537 --> 00:56:16.339
NON COMMERCIAL SO -- THOSE ARE

00:56:16.406 --> 00:56:18.374
THE TWO AREAS THAT I'M A LITTLE

00:56:18.441 --> 00:56:19.676
BIT CONCERNED ABOUT BUT I THE

00:56:19.743 --> 00:56:20.844
FORT OF SUPPORTING A REAL

00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:21.978
HEALTHY YOU'LL BE ABLE TO

00:56:22.045 --> 00:56:22.312
ADDRESS THOSE.

00:56:22.378 --> 00:56:23.813
SO WE GET THERE.

00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:25.081
UNTIL I HAD.

00:56:25.148 --> 00:56:25.982
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT

00:56:27.484 --> 00:56:30.220
ABSOLUTELY -- BUT WE WANT TO

00:56:30.286 --> 00:56:31.755
MAKE SURE THAT THIS BILL.

00:56:31.821 --> 00:56:33.323
GOES FORWARD AS INTENDED WAS

00:56:33.389 --> 00:56:34.958
REALLY JUST PROVIDE INFORMATION

00:56:35.024 --> 00:56:36.493
TO THOSE THAT ARE WORKING -- BUT

00:56:36.559 --> 00:56:39.162
WE IN THESE LINES TO THAT -- AND

00:56:39.229 --> 00:56:40.196
MORE SPECIFICALLY TO YOUR

00:56:40.263 --> 00:56:41.498
QUESTION WE ACTUALLY LIVE

00:56:41.564 --> 00:56:43.433
SPECIFIC LANGUAGES SO IT'S NOT

00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:44.667
BROAD BASE AND HAVE TO BE

00:56:44.734 --> 00:56:45.735
TRANSLATED UNDER DIFFERENT

00:56:45.802 --> 00:56:47.103
LANGUAGES REALLY WERE TRYING TO

00:56:47.170 --> 00:56:48.204
FOCUS ALL LANGUAGES.

00:56:48.271 --> 00:56:50.306
THAT ARE MOST PREDOMINANT -- BUT

00:56:50.373 --> 00:56:52.142
IN THE INDUSTRY ENGLISH

00:56:52.208 --> 00:56:52.776
OBVIOUSLY IS ALREADY THERE ARE

00:56:52.842 --> 00:56:54.711
BEING DONE SPANISH VIETNAMESE

00:56:54.778 --> 00:56:56.813
CHINESE AND KOREAN.

00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:58.681
AND SO -- BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND

00:56:58.748 --> 00:57:01.184
THAT IF WE DON'T SPECIFY THAT IS

00:57:01.251 --> 00:57:02.485
GOOD IT COULD POTENTIALLY BE

00:57:02.552 --> 00:57:03.453
OVERLY BURDENSOME ON INDUSTRY

00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:06.156
AND AS A INDICATOR EARLIER --

00:57:06.222 --> 00:57:07.490
AND ACTUALLY EVEN INDICATE ABOUT

00:57:07.557 --> 00:57:09.859
OPPOSITION -- NOT ONLY OF THESE

00:57:09.926 --> 00:57:12.295
ISSUES ALREADY BEING CREATED BUT

00:57:12.362 --> 00:57:13.630
MANY THE COMPANY'S ALREADY

00:57:13.696 --> 00:57:15.098
PUBLISHING THEM ONLINE AND SOME

00:57:15.165 --> 00:57:16.533
ARE TRANSLATING AS WELL.

00:57:16.599 --> 00:57:19.002
AND SO THE BUT IT'S NOT ASKING

00:57:19.068 --> 00:57:20.537
FOR ADDITIONAL WORK TO BE DONE

00:57:20.603 --> 00:57:21.004
EXCEPT FOR THE ACTUAL

00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:22.438
TRANSLATION WHICH PRESUMABLY

00:57:22.505 --> 00:57:23.339
WOULD HAVE TO BE DONE ONE TIME

00:57:23.406 --> 00:57:24.774
OR MAYBE TOUCHED UP ON OCCASION

00:57:24.841 --> 00:57:26.843
TO UPDATE IT -- BUT IT AND IT IS

00:57:26.910 --> 00:57:28.144
SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR THOSE

00:57:28.211 --> 00:57:30.380
THAT ARE WORKING IN THE SALONS

00:57:30.446 --> 00:57:31.915
NOT BIRD YOU YOU AND I THAT WALK

00:57:31.981 --> 00:57:33.416
IN AND AND AND AND BECAUSE THE

00:57:33.483 --> 00:57:34.284
LANGUAGE IS.

00:57:34.350 --> 00:57:35.485
GEARED TOWARDS THOSE ARE THE

00:57:35.552 --> 00:57:36.986
PROFESSIONALS THAT DEAL WITH

00:57:37.053 --> 00:57:38.354
THESE PRODUCTS EVERY DAY AND SO

00:57:38.421 --> 00:57:40.123
THE IDEA REALLY IS THAT WORKER

00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:41.391
SAFETY AND I THINK THAT.

00:57:41.457 --> 00:57:42.425
BY THAT SALON WORKER HAVING

00:57:42.492 --> 00:57:43.459
GREATER INFORMATION OF COURSE

00:57:43.526 --> 00:57:44.894
THAT CREATES A BETTER CUSTOMER

00:57:44.961 --> 00:57:46.396
EXPERIENCE BOB BECAUSE THEY ALL

00:57:46.462 --> 00:57:48.031
UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE USING.

00:57:48.097 --> 00:57:50.300
HAND UP ALSO TO THE FOR THE

00:57:50.366 --> 00:57:51.000
COMMENT MY POSITION ON THE

00:57:51.067 --> 00:57:52.468
DISINFECTANTS WILL CONTINUE TO

00:57:52.535 --> 00:57:53.570
WORK WITH OPPOSITION TO CLARIFY

00:57:53.636 --> 00:57:54.737
THAT AS WELL AND THEN ALSO ON

00:57:54.804 --> 00:57:56.706
THE COLOR LIKE IT IF IT DOESN'T

00:57:56.773 --> 00:57:58.208
MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO THERE'S TO

00:57:58.274 --> 00:58:05.048
NEVER COLORS I MEAN.

00:58:05.114 --> 00:58:06.449
THEY WITH THIS THE JANICE IS OF

00:58:06.516 --> 00:58:08.084
THE CHEMICALS PROBABLY CLOSE THE

00:58:08.151 --> 00:58:09.752
SAME I'M ASSUMING THAT ON OF

00:58:09.819 --> 00:58:10.587
THAT CREDIT OR GIVE.

00:58:10.653 --> 00:58:11.187
KATHY MITCHELL YEAH I THINK

00:58:11.254 --> 00:58:11.821
THERE'S A MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT

00:58:11.888 --> 00:58:12.355
THE BILL THE BILL DOES NOT

00:58:12.422 --> 00:58:14.490
REQUIRE ANYTHING BEYOND WHAT'S

00:58:14.557 --> 00:58:15.358
ALREADY.

00:58:15.425 --> 00:58:15.525
IT.

00:58:15.592 --> 00:58:17.694
HOW THE BILL READS -- AND MAYBE

00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:19.629
WE SHOULD CLARIFY THIS IS IF

00:58:19.696 --> 00:58:22.198
THERE ARE SEPARATE SAFETY DEED

00:58:22.265 --> 00:58:24.200
DATA SHEETS CREATED. FOUR

00:58:24.267 --> 00:58:26.803
DIFFERENT COLORS THAN THOSE ALSO

00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:29.205
HAVE TO BE PUT ON A WEBSITE.

00:58:29.272 --> 00:58:32.408
SO AGAIN DOES NOT CREATE.

00:58:32.475 --> 00:58:35.345
ANY NEW OBLIGATION -- TO TO

00:58:35.411 --> 00:58:36.746
DEVELOP SAFETY DATA SHEETS IT

00:58:36.813 --> 00:58:38.114
DOES REQUIRE THEM TO CREATE

00:58:38.181 --> 00:58:39.916
SEPARATE DATA SHEETS IT DOES IT

00:58:39.983 --> 00:58:41.618
IS SHE'S ALREADY BY LOBBYING

00:58:41.684 --> 00:58:42.452
CREATED.

00:58:42.518 --> 00:58:43.553
THAT REQUIRES AN OPOSSUM

00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:45.221
SEPARATELY SO IT'S EASIER TO

00:58:45.288 --> 00:58:46.055
FOLLOW.

00:58:46.122 --> 00:58:47.123
AND WE'RE MORE THAN HAPPY TO

00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:48.324
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION

00:58:48.391 --> 00:58:49.692

SO I'M LOOKING AT THE THE

01:08:15.324 --> 01:08:17.693
DEFINED DEFINITION OF A SMALL

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:19.562
WATER SYSTEM WHICH IS.

PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM WHICH IS

I I COMMENDED FOR BRING THIS

01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:30.973
BEFORE I THINK THERE'S A GREAT

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:33.476
OPPORTUNITY IN MANY AREAS.

01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:35.144
TO COMBINED DRIVE THE COST DOWN

01:08:35.211 --> 01:08:36.645
MAYBE GIVE A BETTER SERVICE AND

01:08:36.712 --> 01:08:39.548
ACTUALLY CLEAN UP WATER -- BUT

01:08:39.615 --> 01:08:40.783
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BILL

01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:43.319
EXACTLY HOW WHOSE GET SO THE PC

01:08:43.385 --> 01:08:45.721
IS GOING TO FORCE THEM.

01:08:45.788 --> 01:08:47.189
TO COME CAN CONSOLIDATE.

01:08:47.256 --> 01:08:48.524
NO THIS IS NOT AT ALL ABOUT

01:08:48.591 --> 01:08:49.592
FORCING ANYONE TO CONSOLIDATE

01:08:49.658 --> 01:08:50.593
THAT THE SCENARIO WE'RE

01:08:50.659 --> 01:08:52.061
DISCUSSING IS WHEN YOU'VE GOT

01:08:52.127 --> 01:08:53.162
SMALL WATER SYSTEMS THAT ARE

01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:54.330
FAILING.

01:08:54.396 --> 01:08:55.664
AND THEY WANT TO COMBINE WITH

01:08:55.731 --> 01:08:56.966
TYPICALLY A LARGER SYSTEM OR

01:08:57.032 --> 01:08:59.101
ANOTHER SMALL SYSTEM TO PROVIDE

01:08:59.168 --> 01:09:00.703
DRINKING WATER TO RESIDENTS AND

01:09:00.769 --> 01:09:02.671
SO THEY APPLY FOR APPLICATION.

01:09:02.738 --> 01:09:03.939
AND WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW

01:09:04.006 --> 01:09:05.474
IS THE TIME FRAMES FOR THE

01:09:05.541 --> 01:09:07.510
APPROVALS TO HAPPEN STRETCH

01:09:07.576 --> 01:09:08.611
PRETTY DRAMATICALLY AS WERE

01:09:08.677 --> 01:09:10.045
TRYING TO SHORTEN THAT ONE THING

01:09:10.112 --> 01:09:11.547
I DO WANT TO SAY THAT TO MAKE IT

01:09:11.614 --> 01:09:12.181
VERY CLEAR.

01:09:12.248 --> 01:09:14.383
THE TICKET TO THE CHAIR OF YOU

01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:15.017
AND SEE INTO THE CHAIR OF THIS

01:09:15.084 --> 01:09:17.019
COMMITTEE -- WE ARE PROPOSING A

01:09:17.086 --> 01:09:19.154
FLEXIBLE DEADLINE AND USUALLY

01:09:19.221 --> 01:09:20.089
THOSE TWO WORDS DON'T GO

01:09:20.155 --> 01:09:22.024
TOGETHER BUT OUR STRONG HOPE IS

01:09:22.091 --> 01:09:24.927
THAT -- FOR THE APPROVAL OR

01:09:24.994 --> 01:09:26.095
DENIAL APPLICATIONS AT THAT

01:09:26.161 --> 01:09:27.329
TAKES EIGHT MONTHS FOR THE

01:09:27.396 --> 01:09:28.764
APPROVAL OR DENIAL OF AN ADVICE

01:09:28.831 --> 01:09:30.399
CENTER THE TEXT FOR MONTHS.

01:09:30.466 --> 01:09:32.268
BUT IF THOSE TIME FRAMES DON'T

01:09:32.334 --> 01:09:34.136
WORK THE P. C.'S JUDICIAL

01:09:34.203 --> 01:09:35.804
PROCESS DOES ALLOW FOR TIME

01:09:35.871 --> 01:09:36.839
EXTENSIONS.

01:09:36.906 --> 01:09:38.507
ARE AND IT ALLOWS OF THE PC

01:09:38.574 --> 01:09:39.909
NEEDS MORE TIME TO PROCESS THE

01:09:39.975 --> 01:09:41.510
REQUEST ADDITIONAL TIME CAN BE

01:09:41.577 --> 01:09:43.345
GRANTED SO IT'S NOT A HARD AND

01:09:43.412 --> 01:09:45.114
FAST RULE AND I THINK OF A REP

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:46.181
TO THE SMALL WATER UTILITIES

01:09:46.248 --> 01:09:48.183
THEY WOULD WANT A HARD DEADLINE

01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:51.520
AND WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO DO.

01:09:51.587 --> 01:09:52.121
IS REALLY BALANCE -- WHAT WE

01:09:52.187 --> 01:09:53.022
UNDERSTAND TO BE THE REALITY OF

01:09:53.088 --> 01:09:55.090
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WITH THE

01:09:55.157 --> 01:09:56.292
NEED TO REALLY MOVE THIS FOR

01:09:56.358 --> 01:09:59.094
WHILE FOLKS ARE NOT -- ARE NOT

01:09:59.161 --> 01:10:00.162
DON'T HAVE AVAILABLE DRINKING

01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:01.830
WATER SO WE TRY TO BALANCE IT

01:10:01.897 --> 01:10:03.132
BUT YOUR POINT OF THE

01:10:03.198 --> 01:10:04.600
CIRCUMSTANCE REALLY COMES IN ONE

01:10:04.667 --> 01:10:06.802
SMALL UTILITIES UNDERSTAND LIKE

01:10:06.869 --> 01:10:08.103
THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING WE NEED

NATURALLY OCCURRING IN A LOT OF

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:39.988
COATINGS ARE A LOT OF THINGS

01:17:40.055 --> 01:17:42.657

THAT WAS RAISED BY THE

01:20:44.739 --> 01:20:46.308
OPPOSITION ICE I NOTICED IN THE

SUPPORT OF THIS BILL ALTHOUGH

01:20:47.742 --> 01:20:49.978
HE'LL THE BAY WAS HERE TODAY --

01:20:50.045 --> 01:20:52.013
AND THAT'S NEW TO ME MOST OF THE

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:52.681
SPORT IS COMING FROM SOUTHERN

01:20:52.747 --> 01:20:54.883
CALIFORNIA WHICH MAKES ME THINK

01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:57.118
THAT MOST OF THE IMPACT AND FEES

01:20:57.185 --> 01:20:58.787
ARE BEING SPENT IN SOUTHERN

01:20:58.853 --> 01:20:59.454
CALIFORNIA DO YOU HAVE DATA ON

01:20:59.521 --> 01:21:00.355
WHERE.

01:21:00.422 --> 01:21:04.059
THE FEES ARE BEING USED AND HOW.

01:21:04.125 --> 01:21:05.827
WELL MAYBE YOU HAVE SOME

01:21:05.894 --> 01:21:08.263
SPECIFICS BUT I KNOW THAT --

01:21:08.330 --> 01:21:09.864
WHERE IT'S A BIGGER ISSUE FOR

01:21:09.931 --> 01:21:11.933
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO BE SURE

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.169
BECAUSE OF THE RESPONSIBILITY

01:21:14.236 --> 01:21:16.204
UNDER THE SAME AS FOR PERMITS TO

01:21:16.271 --> 01:21:17.639
THEN COME UP WITH PROJECTS THAT

01:21:17.706 --> 01:21:20.408
ARE GOING TO LOOK? FOR A STORM

01:21:20.475 --> 01:21:23.011
WATER ARE RECAPTURE AND THERE

01:21:23.078 --> 01:21:24.746
HAVE BEEN STUDIES AND REPORTS

01:21:24.813 --> 01:21:26.314
DONE THAT DEFINITELY MAKE A A

01:21:26.381 --> 01:21:29.217
NEXUS LINK BETWEEN TIRE.

01:21:29.284 --> 01:21:30.719
AND ZINC COULD.

01:21:30.785 --> 01:21:31.920
FIND ITS WAY INTO THE STORM

01:21:31.987 --> 01:21:33.822
WATER RUNOFF IT SO IT MAKES IT

01:21:33.888 --> 01:21:34.956
DIFFICULT WHEN YOU HAVE THESE

01:21:35.023 --> 01:21:36.124
POLLUTED WATERS THAT YOU'RE

01:21:36.191 --> 01:21:38.426
DEALING WITH IT IS A PRIORITY

01:21:38.493 --> 01:21:40.161
FOR US IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT.

01:21:40.228 --> 01:21:41.563
BECAUSE CLEARLY IF THE STUDY

01:21:41.630 --> 01:21:43.798
SAYING THAT ZINC IS COMING FROM

01:21:43.865 --> 01:21:45.233
TIRES THAT IT'S GOING TO BE.

01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:47.068
PART OF THE PROBLEM IN TERMS OF

01:21:47.135 --> 01:21:48.570
POLLUTANTS TO BE DEALT WITH

01:21:48.637 --> 01:21:49.704
WE'RE DEALING WITH IT

01:21:49.771 --> 01:21:50.905
IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE WE'RE HAVING

01:21:50.972 --> 01:21:52.741
TO WORK VERY AGGRESSIVELY IN OUR

01:21:52.807 --> 01:21:55.644
AREA -- TO GENERATE REVENUE --

01:21:55.710 --> 01:21:57.312
TO HELP ADDRESS THE PROBLEM AND

01:21:57.379 --> 01:22:00.215
SO AS IT RELATES TO OTHER PARTS

01:22:00.282 --> 01:22:01.082
OF THE STATE.

01:22:01.149 --> 01:22:02.751
THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT IT'S NOT

01:22:02.817 --> 01:22:03.952
AN IMPACT ISSUE IT'S JUST

01:22:04.019 --> 01:22:06.721
BECAUSE FOR US TO TO FOCUS ON IT

01:22:06.788 --> 01:22:07.289
MORE YEAH.

01:22:07.355 --> 01:22:08.757
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WE JUST

01:22:08.823 --> 01:22:10.358
HAVEN'T GONE THROUGH THAT

01:22:10.425 --> 01:22:12.260
PROCESS IN THE BAY AREA IN OTHER

01:22:12.327 --> 01:22:13.662
PARTS OF THE STATE.

01:22:13.728 --> 01:22:17.666
AND WHEN WE DO WE'LL PROBABLY

01:22:17.732 --> 01:22:19.367
FIND WE HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM.

01:22:19.434 --> 01:22:20.835
ON THE I'M NOT ALSO JUST ADD

01:22:20.902 --> 01:22:21.336
WELL TIRES YOU'RE NOT.

01:22:21.403 --> 01:22:24.339
THE ONLY ITEM CAUSING SINK

01:22:24.406 --> 01:22:26.408
POLLUTION.

01:22:26.474 --> 01:22:27.876
THEY'RE NOT TAXING IT AT A RATE.

01:22:27.942 --> 01:22:29.878
THAT WOULD PAY THE BILLIONS AND

01:22:29.944 --> 01:22:31.546
BILLIONS THAT IT'S GONNA COST

01:22:31.613 --> 01:22:38.286
FOR THE CLEANUP -- AT IT'S A

01:22:38.353 --> 01:22:40.655
SMALL DROP IN THE BUCKET.

01:22:40.722 --> 01:22:42.957
BEN AND I JUST I GUESS I WOULD

01:22:43.024 --> 01:22:45.593
ALSO HI IN RESPONSE TO THE

01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:47.028
COMMENT WHERE.

01:22:47.095 --> 01:22:48.430
THE UP.

01:22:48.496 --> 01:22:50.598
POOR FAMILIES WERE OR DRIVING

01:22:50.665 --> 01:22:53.401
AWAY FROM ON WITH BALL TIRES

01:22:53.468 --> 01:22:56.571
BECAUSE OF THE COST OF TIRES AND

01:22:56.638 --> 01:22:57.872
SO THEREFORE THEY'RE NOT.

01:22:57.939 --> 01:22:59.140
BUYING TIRES.

01:22:59.207 --> 01:23:00.942
I I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU THAT THE

01:23:01.009 --> 01:23:04.012
COSTS OF THE TIRES ARE EXPENSIVE

01:23:04.079 --> 01:23:04.579
BECAUSE THEY ARE BEING PRICE

01:23:04.646 --> 01:23:05.013
THAT.

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:07.382
THAT THIS FEE IS AS HAS BEEN

01:23:07.449 --> 01:23:08.817
POINTED OUT AS A VERY NOMINAL

01:23:08.883 --> 01:23:09.851
FEE.

01:23:09.918 --> 01:23:11.219
AS IT RELATES TO TRY BECAUSE

01:23:11.286 --> 01:23:12.754
THERE'S AN IMPACT THAT THE TIRES

01:23:12.821 --> 01:23:14.622
HAVING ON OUR STORM WATER RUNOFF

01:23:14.689 --> 01:23:16.991
AND SO WE'RE ADDRESSING IT FROM

01:23:17.058 --> 01:23:19.194
THAT STANDPOINT BUT HI AND I I

01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:20.395
GO OUT TO LOOK AT THE CAR.

01:23:20.462 --> 01:23:21.363
THE THE COSTA TURNS INTO THE

01:23:21.429 --> 01:23:23.231
FEES THESE FEES ARE NOT WHAT'S

01:23:23.298 --> 01:23:26.167
MAKING THEM -- EXCESSIVELY

01:23:26.234 --> 01:23:27.469
EXPENSIVE.

01:23:27.535 --> 01:23:28.570
YES.

01:23:28.636 --> 01:23:30.472
MS GARCIA ARE YOU HAVE AN

01:23:30.538 --> 01:23:31.072
ADDITIONAL KOSHER GO AHEAD.

01:23:31.139 --> 01:23:31.673
AND THEN MY UNDERSTANDING IS

01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:34.709
THAT THE EXISTING LAW SUNSETS IN

01:23:34.776 --> 01:23:35.276
TWENTY TWENTY FOUR DO I HAVE

01:23:35.343 --> 01:23:36.511
THAT RIGHT.

01:23:36.578 --> 01:23:36.978
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

01:23:37.045 --> 01:23:38.513
SO WHY IT CAN YOU JUST HELP ME

01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:39.581
UNDERSTAND WHY WE'RE DOING THIS

01:23:39.647 --> 01:23:41.483
NOW AND WE'RE NOT WAITING UNTIL

01:23:41.549 --> 01:23:42.517
THE SUN SET AND THEN JUST --

01:23:42.584 --> 01:23:44.285
CLOSER TO THE SUNSET DISCUSSING

01:23:44.352 --> 01:23:45.720
IT IS IT JUST SO WE CAN RAISE

01:23:45.787 --> 01:23:47.355
THE FEES SIR.

01:23:47.422 --> 01:23:51.192
THE LOGIC THERE -- AS THE CHAIRS

01:23:51.259 --> 01:23:53.661
POINTED OUT THIS IS REALLY A A

01:23:53.728 --> 01:23:54.963
DROP IN THE BUCKET NO PUN

01:23:55.029 --> 01:23:56.231
INTENDED BUT THE FACT OF THE

01:23:56.297 --> 01:23:57.232
MATTER IS THAT.

01:23:57.298 --> 01:23:59.968
THE THE COST OF THE PROJECT ARK

01:24:00.034 --> 01:24:03.104
EXCESSIVE AND WE DID PASS A

01:24:03.171 --> 01:24:04.406
MEASURE SO THAT -- LA COUNTY

01:24:04.472 --> 01:24:07.642
VOTERS HAVE A OPPOSED A ATTACKS

01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:09.978

THESE LIMITS FOR PROJECTS.

01:24:14.315 --> 01:24:17.185
AND THIS IS ONE OF THE TOOLS ARE

01:24:17.252 --> 01:24:18.753
JUST SEEN AS A TOOL IN OUR A

01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:20.221

BOX TO HELP US CONTINUE TO GET

01:24:22.290 --> 01:24:23.691
OUR WAY TO WHERE I THINK WE CAN

01:24:23.758 --> 01:24:24.759

ENACT COSMETICS LEGISLATION AND

01:46:06.493 --> 01:46:07.394
SINCE THEN.

01:46:07.461 --> 01:46:09.162
CONGRESS HAS GIVEN THE FDA AND

01:46:09.229 --> 01:46:11.298
THE EPA THE POWER TO REVIEW AND

01:46:11.364 --> 01:46:14.034
REGULATE CHEMICALS IN FOOD AND

01:46:14.101 --> 01:46:16.103
COLORS AND PESTICIDES IN OVER

01:46:16.169 --> 01:46:17.471
THE COUNTER DRUGS IN CLEANING

01:46:17.537 --> 01:46:18.805
PRODUCTS.

01:46:18.872 --> 01:46:20.607
BUT CONGRESS HAS NOT GIVEN THE

01:46:20.674 --> 01:46:22.843
FDA THE POWER THE SAME POWERS TO

01:46:22.909 --> 01:46:24.544
RESTRICT DANGEROUS CHEMICALS OR

01:46:24.611 --> 01:46:27.447

01:46:28.648 --> 01:46:29.516
WE THINK THAT CUT CONSUMER

01:46:29.583 --> 01:46:31.718
SHOULD NOT HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER

01:46:31.785 --> 01:46:33.687
EIGHTY YEARS FOR CONGRESS TO ACT

01:46:33.754 --> 01:46:34.721
AND THAT'S WHY WE THINK

01:46:34.788 --> 01:46:36.189
CALIFORNIA.

01:46:36.256 --> 01:46:37.758
SHOULD JOIN MORE THAN FORTY

WE BOUGHT AT CLEARS BOUTIQUES

01:47:13.827 --> 01:47:15.362
THAT DEPICTED A STORE IN MALLS --

01:47:15.428 --> 01:47:16.997

SPACE PATRICK CETERA.

01:47:23.537 --> 01:47:25.205
THESE ARE PRODUCTS THAT ARE

01:47:25.272 --> 01:47:27.574
MARKETED -- TO USUALLY TEENS

01:47:27.641 --> 01:47:28.108
FREQUENT THAT STORE MOST

01:47:28.175 --> 01:47:29.176
COMMONLY.

01:47:29.242 --> 01:47:30.944

CLEARS IMMEDIATELY UPON FINDING

01:47:32.946 --> 01:47:35.382

PRODUCTS -- STAYED ON STORE

01:47:37.250 --> 01:47:39.886
SHELVES. FOR MORE THAN A YEAR.

01:47:39.953 --> 01:47:41.721
I'M AT THE FTA EVENTUALLY DID

01:47:41.788 --> 01:47:43.456
THEIR OWN TEST RESULTS AND

01:47:43.523 --> 01:47:44.191
ACTUALLY CAME OUT WITH THEIR

01:47:44.257 --> 01:47:46.159
TEST RESULTS LAST MONTH

01:47:46.226 --> 01:47:47.928
CONFIRMING OUR TEST RESULTS AS

01:47:47.994 --> 01:47:49.629
BEST AS WELL AS IN THE PRODUCTS.

01:47:49.696 --> 01:47:50.163
I'M BUT NOTED THAT THEY'D

01:47:50.230 --> 01:47:51.198
ACTUALLY DIDN'T HAVE THE

01:47:51.264 --> 01:47:53.466
AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE CLEARS TO

01:47:53.533 --> 01:47:55.302
REMOVE THEM FROM STORE SHELVES --

01:47:55.368 --> 01:47:56.236
CLEARS DID VOLUNTARILY REMOVE

01:47:56.303 --> 01:47:58.205
THEM FROM STORE SHELVES A FEW

01:47:58.271 --> 01:48:00.140
DAYS LATER UNDER PRESSURE -- BUT

01:48:00.207 --> 01:48:02.409
IT WAS I OPENING FOR ME AT LEAST

01:48:02.475 --> 01:48:03.476
TO REALIZE THAT WE ACTUALLY

01:48:03.543 --> 01:48:03.844
DON'T.

01:48:03.910 --> 01:48:05.846
YEAH IT IS UP TO THE COMPANIES

01:48:05.912 --> 01:48:07.414
TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO KEEP

01:48:07.480 --> 01:48:08.048
THOSE PRODUCTS ON STORE SHELVES

01:48:08.114 --> 01:48:10.450
SO THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE OF WHY WE

01:48:10.517 --> 01:48:11.885
GOT INVOLVED WITH THIS BILL -- I

01:48:11.952 --> 01:48:12.853
DON'T THINK ANYONE I THINK

01:48:12.919 --> 01:48:14.454

BE TO HUMAN HEALTH.

01:48:17.657 --> 01:48:19.893
I'M AND WHY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:21.828
THAT BOTH CONTAMINANTS LIKE LEAD

01:48:21.895 --> 01:48:22.829

THAT ARE -- PART OF THIS BILL

01:51:19.506 --> 01:51:20.774

HEALTH THE FAX FOR EXAMPLE

01:52:11.524 --> 01:52:12.992
LASTLY WANT TO HIGHLIGHT SOME

01:52:13.059 --> 01:52:14.327
OTHER VULNERABLE POPULATIONS.

PARTICULARLY WOMEN OF COLOR FROM

01:52:16.830 --> 01:52:18.398
MINORITY POPULATIONS BECAUSE

01:52:18.465 --> 01:52:20.400
WE'VE SEEN HIGHER EXPOSURES TO

01:52:20.467 --> 01:52:21.835
BEAUTY PRODUCT RELATED CHEMICALS

01:52:21.901 --> 01:52:25.205
WE'VE ALSO FOUND THAT THESE

01:52:25.271 --> 01:52:25.972
EXPOSURES CAN BE LINKED TO SOME

01:52:26.039 --> 01:52:27.640
OF THE STARK HEALTH DISPARITIES

01:52:27.707 --> 01:52:28.741

MY NAME IS MOLLY JENSEN I WORK

01:52:50.964 --> 01:52:52.265
FOR A COMPANY CALLED BIOSCIENCE

WHICH IS THE IT'S A OWNED BY A

01:52:54.701 --> 01:52:56.136
PARENT COMPANY AMOROUS WHICH HAS

01:52:56.202 --> 01:52:57.270
ABOUT.

01:52:57.337 --> 01:52:58.738
FOUR HUNDRED EMPLOYEES I'VE BEEN

01:52:58.805 --> 01:53:01.040
IN THE BEAUTY INDUSTRY FOR

01:53:01.107 --> 01:53:03.143
THIRTY FIVE PLUS YEARS AND HAVE

01:53:03.209 --> 01:53:05.845
SEEN A LOT OF CHANGES -- I CAN

01:53:05.912 --> 01:53:07.514
ATTEST TO THE FACT THAT THESE

01:53:07.580 --> 01:53:09.215
CHEMICALS ARE NOT NEEDED I'M A

01:53:09.282 --> 01:53:11.050
FORMULATOR AS WELL.

01:53:11.117 --> 01:53:13.786
AND BASICALLY THAT THEY'RE VERY

01:53:13.853 --> 01:53:18.057
ANTIQUATED AND IT'S IT'S NOT

01:53:18.124 --> 01:53:20.460
SOMETHING ABOUT.

01:53:20.527 --> 01:53:21.895
I'M NOT HERE ON BEHALF OF MY CUT

01:53:21.961 --> 01:53:24.764
MY CUSTOMER BECAUSE MY CUSTOMER

01:53:24.831 --> 01:53:26.933
OF IS ALREADY OF OF SEARCHING

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:28.301
FOR CLEANING PRODUCTS.

01:53:28.368 --> 01:53:29.602
I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE

01:53:29.669 --> 01:53:30.303
THIRTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL THAT GOES

01:53:30.370 --> 01:53:32.405
INTO A WALGREENS LOOKING FOR THE

01:53:32.472 --> 01:53:34.107
THE BLOCKS OF LIP GLOSS OR EYE

01:53:34.174 --> 01:53:35.175
SHADOW.

01:53:35.241 --> 01:53:36.209
THAT DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT

01:53:36.276 --> 01:53:37.944
INGREDIENTS AND DOESN'T HAVE THE

01:53:38.011 --> 01:53:39.179
SAFEGUARD.

01:53:39.245 --> 01:53:41.247
SO I THINK IT REALLY IS VITAL

01:53:41.314 --> 01:53:42.649

02:00:25.718 --> 02:00:28.321
QUESTION BUT ALSO -- ITS USE IN

02:00:28.387 --> 02:00:34.460
THAT PRODUCT AND ANY POTENTIAL

02:00:34.527 --> 02:00:35.094
ALTERNATIVES FURTHER THE LAW WAS

02:00:35.161 --> 02:00:36.228
PASSED IN A WITH THE INTEREST OF

02:00:36.295 --> 02:00:36.862
KIND OF LOOKING AT A ROBUST --

02:00:36.929 --> 02:00:37.964
LIST OF FACTORS TO EVALUATE

02:00:38.030 --> 02:00:40.099
POTENTIAL TRADE OFFS BETWEEN YOU

02:00:40.166 --> 02:00:41.500
KNOW ENVIRONMENTAL.

02:00:41.567 --> 02:00:44.570
IMPACTS ON HUMAN HEALTH IMPACTS --

02:00:44.637 --> 02:00:46.672
AND A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL A

02:00:46.739 --> 02:00:48.240
PARTICULAR A SPECIFIED IMPACTS

02:00:48.307 --> 02:00:50.610
IN IN KIND OF THOSE CATEGORIES

02:00:50.676 --> 02:00:53.446
I'M IN WITH REGARD TO A BEFORE

02:00:53.512 --> 02:00:54.080
NINETY FIVE AS WAS MENTIONED IT

02:00:54.146 --> 02:00:57.416
DOES TAKE ON APPROACH LOOKING

02:00:57.483 --> 02:00:57.783
OUT BEGINNING.

02:00:57.850 --> 02:00:58.618
A CHEMICAL INGREDIENTS THAT MAY

02:00:58.684 --> 02:01:00.186
BE USED IN THESE PRODUCTS A

02:01:00.252 --> 02:01:02.855
NUMBER OF THEM -- MAY NOT BE BUT

02:01:02.922 --> 02:01:04.557
NONE THE LESS THE PROGRAM IS SET

02:01:04.624 --> 02:01:06.225
UP TO EVALUATE THAT LOOK AT THE

02:01:06.292 --> 02:01:08.361
TRADE OFFS I'M LOOK AT IT.

02:01:08.427 --> 02:01:09.929
LESSENING EXPOSURE WHERE THERE

02:01:09.996 --> 02:01:11.397
MAY NOT BE ALTERNATIVES

02:01:11.464 --> 02:01:13.766
AVAILABLE -- BUT ALSO LOOK AT

02:01:13.833 --> 02:01:15.001
VARIOUS KIND OF THRESHOLD BUT

02:01:15.067 --> 02:01:16.969
MAYBE SET BY SOME OF THE MOST

02:01:17.036 --> 02:01:19.372
STRINGENT ON BODIES ARE BOTH IN

02:01:19.438 --> 02:01:21.407
STATE AS WELL AS ON THE NATION

02:01:21.474 --> 02:01:22.775
AND WORLD LIKE A WE HARDLY

02:01:22.842 --> 02:01:23.976
OFFICE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH

02:01:24.043 --> 02:01:25.011
HAZARD ASSESSMENT.

02:01:25.077 --> 02:01:26.278
WHICH DOES SETS ARE PRETTY

02:01:26.345 --> 02:01:27.980
STRINGENT LIMITS WE WOULD ARGUE

02:01:28.047 --> 02:01:29.882
FROM THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY SOME

02:01:29.949 --> 02:01:31.217
OF THE MOST STRINGENT LIMITS

02:01:31.283 --> 02:01:32.785
THERE ARE WHEN IT COMES -- TO

02:01:32.852 --> 02:01:33.953
CHEMICALS AND CHEMICAL

02:01:34.020 --> 02:01:40.393
REGULATION.

02:01:40.459 --> 02:01:42.361
IN TERMS OF ONE OF THE WORK THAT

02:01:42.428 --> 02:01:43.529
DTS HE HAS UNDER WAY NOW AND AS

02:01:43.596 --> 02:01:44.196
YOU MAY BE AWARE THEIR WORK PLAN

02:01:44.263 --> 02:01:45.197
DOES CURRENTLY ON THAT THEY ARE

02:01:45.264 --> 02:01:45.831
LOOKING AT INCLUDED -- BEAUTY

02:01:45.898 --> 02:01:46.999
PERSONAL CARE AND HYGIENE

02:01:47.066 --> 02:01:48.601
PRODUCTS THAT ARE IN SCOPE FOR

02:01:48.668 --> 02:01:50.236
THEIR REVIEW CURRENTLY IN THIS

02:01:50.302 --> 02:01:52.505
CURRENT -- PROCESS AND EVEN MORE

02:01:52.571 --> 02:01:54.006
SO THEY'VE ACTUALLY MOVE MADE

02:01:54.073 --> 02:01:55.574
THE MOVES AND ARE CURRENTLY

02:01:55.641 --> 02:01:57.543
WORKING ON A DEVELOPMENT OF

02:01:57.610 --> 02:01:59.545
REGULATIONS SPECIFIC TO ONE OF

02:01:59.612 --> 02:02:01.213
THE LISTED CHEMICAL INGREDIENTS

02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:02.848
IN THE BILL TAL EWING AND NAIL

02:02:02.915 --> 02:02:03.983
PRODUCTS.

02:02:04.050 --> 02:02:05.251
SO I THINK IT IS INDICATING

02:02:05.317 --> 02:02:06.652
INDICATIVE OF THE FACT THAT THE

02:02:06.719 --> 02:02:08.421
PROCESS IS WORKING AND THEY ARE

02:02:08.487 --> 02:02:09.722
LOOKING OUT.

02:02:09.789 --> 02:02:10.956
OF THESE TYPES OF INGREDIENT

02:02:11.023 --> 02:02:12.558
POTENTIAL INGREDIENTS AND

02:02:12.625 --> 02:02:13.726
ALTERNATIVES IN THESE TYPES OF

02:02:13.793 --> 02:02:15.828
PRODUCTS UNDERSTANDING AND

02:02:15.895 --> 02:02:17.463
HEARING FROM STAKEHOLDERS OF

02:02:17.530 --> 02:02:18.931
THAT THERE IS AN INTEREST THERE

02:02:18.998 --> 02:02:20.499
ARE CONCERNS WITH REGARD TO THAT.

02:02:20.566 --> 02:02:21.534
FURTHER I WOULD NOTE THAT THE

02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:22.835
PROCESS DOES ALLOW FOR A

02:02:22.902 --> 02:02:24.036
PETITION PROCESS FOR

02:02:24.103 --> 02:02:26.005
STAKEHOLDERS A TO REQUEST FOR

02:02:26.072 --> 02:02:27.506
THE REVIEW OF INDIVIDUAL

02:02:27.573 --> 02:02:29.275
CHEMICAL PRODUCT COMBINATIONS

02:02:29.341 --> 02:02:30.743
ARE SO THAT ALSO IS ANOTHER

02:02:30.810 --> 02:02:32.144
MECHANISM ALSO.

02:02:32.211 --> 02:02:33.813
WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO PUT

02:02:33.879 --> 02:02:35.247
THOSE HANDS IN THE DECISION OF

02:02:35.314 --> 02:02:37.983
SCIENTISTS SO WITH THAT WE DO --

02:02:38.050 --> 02:02:39.585
BELIEVE THAT THAT PROCESS IS A

02:02:39.652 --> 02:02:41.387
MORE APPROPRIATE FOR THESE TYPES

02:02:41.454 --> 02:02:42.855
OF OUR PRODUCT INGREDIENT

02:02:42.922 --> 02:02:45.558
CHEMICAL BEYOND DISCUSSIONS --

02:02:45.624 --> 02:02:46.826
AND LEAVES OPPORTUNITY FOR THE

02:02:46.892 --> 02:02:48.160
SCIENTISTS TO MAKE THE DECISIONS

02:02:48.227 --> 02:02:50.162
AS TO WHETHER TO LESSEN EXPOSURE

02:02:50.229 --> 02:02:52.598
BASED ON KIND OF OTHER.

02:02:52.665 --> 02:02:55.401
MECHANISMS BY YOU KNOW LIMóN

02:02:55.468 --> 02:02:56.068
EIGHTEEN ADDING POTENTIAL

INGREDIENT IN QUESTION

02:02:57.236 --> 02:02:58.738
EVALUATING THE TRADE OFFS

02:02:58.804 --> 02:02:59.905
BETWEEN THAT AND POTENTIAL

02:02:59.972 --> 02:03:01.173
ALTERNATIVES TO AVOID

02:03:01.240 --> 02:03:02.908
REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTES.

02:03:02.975 --> 02:03:04.777
AND THE LIKE SO WITH THAT -- WE

02:03:04.844 --> 02:03:08.114
RESPECTFULLY MUST OPPOSE THE

ADVANTAGE OF THE EXPERTISE THAT

02:04:18.384 --> 02:04:20.119
I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE NOT BEEN.

02:04:20.186 --> 02:04:22.721
ABLE TO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF

02:04:22.788 --> 02:04:27.293
IT THAT -- HERE TODAY BUT TO

PRESENT -- WHAT WE FEEL -- AND

02:04:36.202 --> 02:04:39.138
IS A COMPELLING CASE THAT OVER

02:04:39.205 --> 02:04:40.873
FORTY NATIONS HAVE A READY

02:04:40.940 --> 02:04:42.741
EITHER BANNED OR RESTRICTED MANY

02:04:42.808 --> 02:04:43.843
OF THESE CHEMICALS I MEAN FIRST

02:04:43.909 --> 02:04:45.211
OF ALL LET'S START WITH THE LIST

02:04:45.277 --> 02:04:46.478
OF CHEMICALS BECAUSE I KNOW OF

02:04:46.545 --> 02:04:48.047
HAD SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS WITH

02:04:48.113 --> 02:04:49.615
MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE ABOUT.

02:04:49.682 --> 02:04:51.383
THE LIST OF THE THE CHEMICALS I

02:04:51.450 --> 02:04:52.251
THINK THERE ARE.

02:04:52.318 --> 02:04:53.986
YOU KNOW SOME CHEMICALS THAT WE

02:04:54.053 --> 02:04:55.788
SHOULD ALL BE OF THE GREE ON

02:04:55.855 --> 02:04:57.656
THAT HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO PLACE IN

02:04:57.723 --> 02:04:59.992
ANY -- COSMETICS YES YEAH I

02:05:00.059 --> 02:05:01.794
THINK WE CAN COULD SEE FOR THAT

02:05:01.861 --> 02:05:03.462
YEAH THAT FOR LEAD US BEST DOES

02:05:03.529 --> 02:05:05.364
IN MERCURY FOR SURE THANK YOU

02:05:05.431 --> 02:05:07.900
SIR AND SO YOU KNOW I YOU KNOW.

02:05:07.967 --> 02:05:10.369
THAT IN AND OF ITSELF SHOWS THE

02:05:10.436 --> 02:05:12.238
SHORT COMING WHY THE GREEN

02:05:12.304 --> 02:05:14.840
CHEMISTRY PROGRAM HAS FAILED TO

02:05:14.907 --> 02:05:16.742
ENSURE THAT AS BEST THIS IS NOT

02:05:16.809 --> 02:05:19.778
FOUND IN THE TALC OF PRODUCTS

02:05:19.845 --> 02:05:21.413
YOU KNOW WHY WE ARE FOUND OF

02:05:21.480 --> 02:05:22.615
FINDING.

02:05:22.681 --> 02:05:24.450
THE CHEMICALS THAT WE CAN AGREE

02:05:24.516 --> 02:05:31.023
ON BEING SOLD TO OUR OUR YOU

02:05:31.090 --> 02:05:32.024
KNOW OUR YOUNG GIRLS ARE

02:05:32.091 --> 02:05:32.791
TEENAGERS ESPECIALLY GAL --

02:05:32.858 --> 02:05:34.193
YOUNG WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE

02:05:34.260 --> 02:05:34.793
YOU KNOW.

02:05:34.860 --> 02:05:36.228
THESE THESE CHEMICALS -- THAT

02:05:36.295 --> 02:05:38.264
HAPPENED FOUND AND PRODUCTS LIKE

02:05:38.330 --> 02:05:41.533
CLAIRE'S LIKE JUSTICE AS AS THE

02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:43.903
YOU KNOW -- THE IDENTIFIED IN IN

02:05:43.969 --> 02:05:45.704
YOUR COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND AND

02:05:45.771 --> 02:05:47.039
I I THINK THE IN TERMS OF THE

02:05:47.106 --> 02:05:49.375
GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM WHILE WE

02:05:49.441 --> 02:05:51.277
YOU KNOW CERTAINLY -- HERE THE

02:05:51.343 --> 02:05:53.178
ARGUMENT OFTEN THAT -- WITH THAT

02:05:53.245 --> 02:05:54.613
WE SHOULD LET THE SCIENTISTS THE

02:05:54.680 --> 02:05:55.881
DETERMINE RATHER THAN

02:05:55.948 --> 02:05:57.816
LEGISLATORS AYE AYE AYE THING AT

02:05:57.883 --> 02:05:59.285
AGAIN AS YOUR COMMITTEE AND ALSO

02:05:59.351 --> 02:06:00.319
IT'S CLEARLY.

02:06:00.386 --> 02:06:02.621
IDENTIFIES EVER SINCE THE GREEN

02:06:02.688 --> 02:06:08.160
CHEMISTRY PROGRAM WAS STARTED IN

02:06:08.227 --> 02:06:08.761
IN.

02:06:08.827 --> 02:06:09.528
TWO THOUSAND NINE THE PROGRAM

02:06:09.595 --> 02:06:11.730
HAS ONLY -- IDENTIFIED THREE

02:06:11.797 --> 02:06:13.866
PRODUCT CHEMICAL COMBINATIONS

02:06:13.933 --> 02:06:14.967
THAT HAVE BEEN CURRENTLY FILE

02:06:15.034 --> 02:06:16.769
FINALIZED AND THREE MORE IN

02:06:16.835 --> 02:06:18.470
VARIOUS STAGES OF THE PROGRAM IN

02:06:18.537 --> 02:06:20.906
THE MEANTIME WE CONTINUE TO HAVE.

02:06:20.973 --> 02:06:22.408
YOU KNOW THESE HIGHLY TOXIC

02:06:22.474 --> 02:06:23.976
CHEMICALS THAT WE YOU KNOW WE

02:06:24.043 --> 02:06:25.744
SOME OF WHICH WE ALL OF US

02:06:25.811 --> 02:06:27.279
SHOULD BE A DEGREE ON AND OTHERS

02:06:27.346 --> 02:06:29.081
WE YOU KNOW WE WE CERTAINLY WILL

02:06:29.148 --> 02:06:29.715
BE.

02:06:29.782 --> 02:06:31.083
YOU KNOW ARE OPEN TO

02:06:31.150 --> 02:06:33.118
CONVERSATIONS IN TERMS OF OF THE

02:06:33.185 --> 02:06:35.888
SPECIFIC CHEMICALS THAT -- THAT

02:06:35.955 --> 02:06:38.357
WE WE WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS SO

02:06:38.424 --> 02:06:40.025
THAT WE SHOULD ADDRESS AND THOSE

02:06:40.092 --> 02:06:42.094
THAT PERHAPS YOU KNOW WE WE CAN

02:06:42.161 --> 02:06:43.662
TALK ABOUT LEAVING OFFER.

02:06:43.729 --> 02:06:45.631
SOME OTHER CHEMICALS THAT ARE ON

02:06:45.698 --> 02:06:47.599
THIS LIST WE ARE ALSO HAPPY TO

02:06:47.666 --> 02:06:48.634
TALK ABOUT.

02:06:48.701 --> 02:06:51.337
YOU KNOW A A PHASE OUT PERIOD IN

02:06:51.403 --> 02:06:52.671
TERMS OF ENSURING THAT WERE

02:06:52.738 --> 02:06:55.341
PROTECTING CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS --

02:06:55.407 --> 02:06:56.809
BY BY GIVING -- THAT THE

02:06:56.875 --> 02:06:58.610
INDUSTRY BY GIVING MANUFACTURERS

02:06:58.677 --> 02:07:00.279
ENOUGH TIME TO TO TRY TO PHASE

02:07:00.346 --> 02:07:01.513
OUT SOME OF THESE.

02:07:01.580 --> 02:07:04.049
THESE INGREDIENTS BUT THE BOTTOM

02:07:04.116 --> 02:07:06.051
LINE IS THAT THE GREEN CHEMISTRY

02:08:07.513 --> 02:08:08.947
AGREE WITH THE OPPOSITION THAT.

02:08:09.014 --> 02:08:11.417
I'VE GOT LEAD IN MY HAIR ON MY

02:08:11.483 --> 02:08:13.652
LIPS IT'S EVERYWHERE -- BUT WE

02:08:13.719 --> 02:08:15.354
WERE ASKING FOR AN AMENDMENT TO

IT SAYING THAT FOR NATURAL

02:08:17.689 --> 02:08:19.291
OCCURRING ELEMENTS.

02:08:19.358 --> 02:08:24.363
THAT IS SO LONG AS IT'S A THE

MINIMUS AMOUNT AND I CAN'T SAY

DIMINISH IN THE MINIMUM OUT OF

02:08:30.369 --> 02:08:30.969
AS BEST AS TO NOT.

02:08:31.036 --> 02:08:31.470
BUT GIVEN THE STATE OF

02:08:31.537 --> 02:08:32.037
ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY WE CAN

02:08:32.104 --> 02:08:34.173

LEAD OR ASBESTOS OR MERCURY.

02:08:52.791 --> 02:08:54.226
THERE OTHER CHEMICALS IN HERE

02:08:54.293 --> 02:08:55.527
HAVING TALKED WITH THE

02:08:55.594 --> 02:09:01.300
OPPOSITION I DON'T THINK THERE

02:09:01.366 --> 02:09:02.534
IS A GOOD CASE FOR BEING MADE

02:09:02.601 --> 02:09:03.202
FOR PUTTING THEM ON THIS LIST --

02:09:03.268 --> 02:09:03.802
AND WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS TO

02:09:03.869 --> 02:09:05.370
WORK WITH BOTH THAT PROPONENTS

02:09:05.437 --> 02:09:08.140
AND OPPONENTS SO THAT COME.

02:09:08.207 --> 02:09:11.110

WE HAVE PLENTY OF TIME -- THAT --

02:09:14.513 --> 02:09:15.547
I HAVE A LIST THAT I'M

02:09:15.614 --> 02:09:18.050
COMFORTABLE WITH AND THAT LIST

02:09:18.117 --> 02:09:20.018
HAS TO BE ONE WHERE THE

02:09:20.085 --> 02:09:22.054
CHEMICALS WERE TALKING ABOUT.

02:09:22.121 --> 02:09:25.224
OUR BECAUSE I DON'T WANT

02:09:25.290 --> 02:09:25.524
[inaudible]

02:09:25.591 --> 02:09:29.661
THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE TO VOTE

02:09:29.728 --> 02:09:32.164
ON NEW SCIENCE I DON'T WANT THEM

02:09:32.231 --> 02:09:34.066
TO SAY WELL THIS IS IN BAND

02:09:34.133 --> 02:09:35.067
ANYWHERE BUT WE'RE GOING TO BAN

02:09:35.134 --> 02:09:37.736
IT.

02:09:37.803 --> 02:09:38.370
I THINK THAT'S INAPPROPRIATE.

02:09:38.437 --> 02:09:38.904
I DO THINK WHEN THERE'S A

02:09:38.971 --> 02:09:40.973
CONSENSUS AND I'VE MENTIONED LET

02:09:41.039 --> 02:09:42.441
US BEST TO SUE MERCURY.

02:09:42.508 --> 02:09:44.409
THAT WE ARE TO REACH CONSENSUS

02:09:44.476 --> 02:09:47.179
AND HOW MANY OF THESE ARE.

02:09:47.246 --> 02:09:50.582
HEARING FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT

02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:02.060
INCLUDE THOSE THERE OTHERS THAT

02:10:02.127 --> 02:10:02.694

02:10:04.029 --> 02:10:04.897
IS.

02:10:04.963 --> 02:10:06.465
WHAT I DO WANT IS WHEN THERE'S

02:10:06.532 --> 02:10:07.933
GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.802
SOMETHING'S A AN ISSUE THAT IT'S

02:10:10.869 --> 02:10:12.137
BEEN SEEN BY THE VARIOUS?

02:10:12.204 --> 02:10:14.339
AUTHORITIES TO BE AN ISSUE THEN

02:10:14.406 --> 02:10:16.108
WE CAN AGREE ON IT AND IF IT'S

02:10:16.175 --> 02:10:17.643
IN QUESTION.

02:10:17.709 --> 02:10:18.977
WE HAVE TO THINK VERY HARD

02:10:19.044 --> 02:10:21.146
BEFORE WE MAKE A DECISION SO I

WAS THAT BECAUSE OUR PROCESS.

02:10:38.297 --> 02:10:39.865

02:21:01.653 --> 02:21:02.720
ONCE WIPES GET FURTHER DOWN IN

02:21:02.787 --> 02:21:04.856
THE SYSTEMS OF LARGE RAGS

02:21:04.923 --> 02:21:06.391
COMBINED WITH OTHER DEBRIS GET

02:21:06.457 --> 02:21:07.725
WRAPPED UP IN HEAVY MECHANICAL

02:21:07.792 --> 02:21:09.360
FEATURES LIKE PUMPS.

02:21:09.427 --> 02:21:11.029
AND MOTORS AND SCREENS REQUIRING

02:21:11.095 --> 02:21:12.263
ADDITIONAL MAINTENANCE OR

02:21:12.330 --> 02:21:13.898
REPLACEMENT OF THE STRUCTURES

02:21:13.965 --> 02:21:15.834
THE CONSTANT REMEDIATION EFFORTS

02:21:15.900 --> 02:21:17.001
DISRUPT ALL STAGES OF THE

02:21:17.068 --> 02:21:18.336
TREATMENT PROCESS AND RESULT IN

02:21:18.403 --> 02:21:20.071
COSTS ON MANY LEVELS FOR PUBLIC

02:21:20.138 --> 02:21:21.539
AGENCIES AND ULTIMATELY RATE

02:21:21.606 --> 02:21:22.841
PAYERS.

02:21:22.907 --> 02:21:23.775
I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT

02:21:23.842 --> 02:21:26.077
MANY WIPES CONTAIN PLASTIC AND

02:21:26.144 --> 02:21:27.312
DON'T ABIDE.

02:21:27.378 --> 02:21:29.781
BY ANY -- LABELING CODE OF

02:21:29.848 --> 02:21:31.149
PRACTICE AND WHEN THOSE ARE

02:21:31.216 --> 02:21:32.717
FLASH THEY CAN CONTRIBUTE TO

02:21:32.784 --> 02:21:34.552
LOADINGS OF MICRO PLASTICS AND

02:21:34.619 --> 02:21:36.154
WASTEWATER EFFLUENT.

02:21:36.221 --> 02:21:38.289
THERE IS SIGNIFICANT TIME ENERGY

02:21:38.356 --> 02:21:39.958
AND PUBLIC MONEY BEING SPENT ON

02:21:40.024 --> 02:21:42.093
MASSIVE PUBLIC EDUCATION EFFORTS

02:21:42.160 --> 02:21:43.361
ABOUT THE PROBLEMS WITH FLUSHING

02:21:43.428 --> 02:21:44.295
WIPES.

02:21:44.362 --> 02:21:45.997
PRETTY MUCH EVERY AGENCY HAS

02:21:46.064 --> 02:21:47.932
DONE OUT REACH ABOUT WIPES FOR

02:21:47.999 --> 02:21:49.400
MANY YEARS AND WE'RE HERE TODAY

02:21:49.467 --> 02:21:51.169
BECAUSE EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGN

02:21:51.236 --> 02:21:53.071
SIMPLY AREN'T EFFECTIVE ENOUGH

02:21:53.137 --> 02:21:54.839
AND MANAGING THIS PROBLEM WE

02:21:54.906 --> 02:21:56.441
KNOW THAT PUBLIC EDUCATION AND

02:21:56.507 --> 02:21:57.242
OUTREACH.

02:21:57.308 --> 02:21:59.277
ALONE ISN'T SUFFICIENT BECAUSE

02:21:59.344 --> 02:22:00.411
WE'VE ALSO DONE PARALLEL

02:22:00.478 --> 02:22:02.247
CUSTOMER OUT REACH ON FAT SOILS

02:22:02.313 --> 02:22:03.715
INCREASE FOR DECADES AND IT

02:22:03.781 --> 02:22:05.917
CONTINUES TO ALSO BE A PROBLEM.

02:22:05.984 --> 02:22:07.986
IN OUR SYSTEMS WE RECENTLY DID

02:22:08.052 --> 02:22:09.520
SOME POLLING ON THIS ISSUE IN

02:22:09.587 --> 02:22:10.855
THE BAY AREA AND BY A LARGE

02:22:10.922 --> 02:22:12.657
MARGIN IT WAS EVIDENT THAT

02:22:12.724 --> 02:22:14.192
CONSUMERS TRUST THE LABELING ON

02:22:14.259 --> 02:22:16.127
PACKAGES AND THAT IS THEIR

02:22:16.194 --> 02:22:17.228
PREFERRED METHOD FOR RECEIVING

02:22:17.295 --> 02:22:18.830
INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROPER

02:22:18.897 --> 02:22:20.331
DISPOSAL OF THESE PRODUCTS.

02:22:20.398 --> 02:22:22.634
FAR AND ABOVE HEARING ABOUT IT

02:22:22.700 --> 02:22:24.335
FROM THEIR LOCAL SEWER UTILITY

02:22:24.402 --> 02:22:25.470
THE PERFORMANCE METRICS FOR

02:22:25.536 --> 02:22:26.704
FLEXIBILITY IN THIS BILL ARE

02:22:26.771 --> 02:22:28.039
BASED ON SCIENCE AND THEY

02:22:28.106 --> 02:22:30.008
ACCURATELY REFLECT THE

02:22:30.074 --> 02:22:31.342
CONDITIONS IN THE SEWER.

02:22:31.409 --> 02:22:32.176
ESPECIALLY IN THE SYSTEMS HERE

02:22:32.243 --> 02:22:33.511
IN CALIFORNIA WHERE THERE'S LESS

02:22:33.578 --> 02:22:35.246
TURBULENCE BECAUSE OF SUCCESSFUL

02:22:35.313 --> 02:22:37.048

02:22:37.115 --> 02:22:38.416
THE METRICS WERE DEVELOPED BY AN

02:22:38.483 --> 02:22:40.184

02:22:54.832 --> 02:22:55.600
IT'S TIME TO ADDRESS THIS

THE BEST SOLUTIONS FOR

OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL.

02:25:01.125 --> 02:25:02.293
WE'VE ALL SEEN THE PICTURES OF

THE BIG UGLY CLOGS THAT ARE

02:25:04.128 --> 02:25:06.097
PULLED OUT OF SYSTEMS MANY SUCH

MAJOR CLOGS IN THE UNITED STATES

02:25:16.140 --> 02:25:18.242

02:25:18.309 --> 02:25:19.710
MOSTLY THE CASE OF MISTAKEN

THE WASTEWATER COLLECTION

02:25:22.213 --> 02:25:23.414
STUDIES INDICATE THAT POSSIBLE

02:25:23.481 --> 02:25:25.917
WIPES ARE NOT THE PRIMARY CAUSES

02:25:25.983 --> 02:25:27.652
OF CLOGS AND SEWER SYSTEMS. FOR

02:25:27.718 --> 02:25:29.954

COLLECTED AT 2%.

02:25:44.402 --> 02:25:44.902

FLUSHABLE WIPES ARE NOT THE

LESS THAN 2%.

02:26:24.075 --> 02:26:25.276
THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM WAS

02:26:25.343 --> 02:26:27.011
THE FLUSHING OF MATERIALS MEANT

NAME I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH

02:34:09.673 --> 02:34:11.442
SOMETHING AND OFF THE TOP OF MY

02:34:11.508 --> 02:34:13.010
HEAD.

02:34:13.077 --> 02:34:14.878
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK A JUDGE DO

02:34:14.945 --> 02:34:16.180
I THINK WE'VE ESTABLISHED

02:34:16.246 --> 02:34:16.480
[inaudible]

02:34:16.547 --> 02:34:17.982
THAT FACT.

02:34:18.048 --> 02:34:19.416
SO I THINK YOU CAN GO ON TO YOUR

02:34:19.483 --> 02:34:20.918
NEXT QUESTION.

02:34:20.985 --> 02:34:22.720
THERE'S A FACT ESTABLISHED SHE

02:34:22.786 --> 02:34:25.356
DOESN'T NOW OKAY -- I MEAN I'M

02:34:25.422 --> 02:34:27.024
NOT TRYING TO BADGER HER I'M

02:34:27.091 --> 02:34:28.892
JUST I'M GENERALLY ASKING A

02:34:28.959 --> 02:34:30.361
QUESTION BUT WE WILL ME WELL SHE

02:34:30.427 --> 02:34:32.463
SAID SHE DOESN'T KNOW.

02:34:32.529 --> 02:34:35.633
OKAY YOU CAN GO ON OKAY SO.

02:34:35.699 --> 02:34:38.869
IF I COULD JUST -- ARTICULATE A

02:34:38.936 --> 02:34:41.171
LITTLE BIT FURTHER I DON'T THINK

02:34:41.238 --> 02:34:42.606
THERE'S A DISAGREEMENT.

02:34:42.673 --> 02:34:45.242
BETWEEN THE OPPOSITION OURSELVES

02:34:45.309 --> 02:34:47.344
THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM OUT

02:34:47.411 --> 02:34:50.414
THERE WITH -- THINGS NOT BEING

02:34:50.481 --> 02:34:53.183
MARKED PROPERLY THE QUESTION OF

02:34:53.250 --> 02:34:56.553
WHERE WE DISAGREE IS.

02:34:56.620 --> 02:34:58.255
WHERE THE LINE GETS DRAWN?

02:34:58.322 --> 02:34:59.556
SO I THINK THERE'S GENERAL

02:34:59.623 --> 02:35:00.824
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT THESE

02:35:00.891 --> 02:35:05.195

USING THEM AND THEY'RE DISPOSING

02:35:06.697 --> 02:35:07.264
THEM IN WAYS THAT THEY SHOULDN'T

02:35:07.331 --> 02:35:10.367
BE DISPOSED OF OKAY END THANK

02:35:10.434 --> 02:35:12.436

02:35:12.503 --> 02:35:16.106
I KNOW THAT.

02:35:16.173 --> 02:35:17.741
WE HAVE THESE CLOGS I THINK

02:35:17.808 --> 02:35:20.678
THERE'S A PERCEPTION THAT --

02:35:20.744 --> 02:35:23.814
IT'S ALL DUE TO THESE FLUSHABLE

02:35:23.881 --> 02:35:26.083
WIPES AND I DON'T I JUST DON'T

02:35:26.150 --> 02:35:27.518
KNOW HOW YOU CAN PROVE THAT EVEN

02:35:27.584 --> 02:35:28.185
GET.

02:35:28.252 --> 02:35:31.588
GIVEN A FORENSIC ANALYSIS --

02:35:31.655 --> 02:35:32.723
THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO

02:35:32.790 --> 02:35:34.224
JUST FLUSH HIM EVEN THOUGH THEY

02:35:34.291 --> 02:35:35.225
YOU KNOW YOU KNOW IT SAYS RIGHT

02:35:35.292 --> 02:35:36.994
ON THERE DO NOT FLUSH WHICH I

02:35:37.061 --> 02:35:38.462
CAN'T IMAGINE DOING BUT YOU KNOW

02:35:38.529 --> 02:35:39.496
PEOPLE DO IT.

02:35:39.563 --> 02:35:41.398
SO I'M NOT EVEN I JUST I'M NOT

02:35:41.465 --> 02:35:42.599
CERTAIN.

02:35:42.666 --> 02:35:45.602
HOW THIS BILL WOULD STOP THAT

02:35:45.669 --> 02:35:51.141
BEHAVIOR -- BUT I'M I'M OPEN TO

02:35:51.208 --> 02:35:54.078
HEARING -- YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE

02:35:54.144 --> 02:35:55.212
WHAT YOU'RE SOLUTIONS TO THIS

02:35:55.279 --> 02:35:57.114
SUMMER THE BILL IS INTENDED TO

02:35:57.181 --> 02:35:59.583
HAVE UNIFORM -- CAUGHT LET A

02:35:59.650 --> 02:36:05.889
UNIFORM LABELING REQUIREMENT.

02:36:05.956 --> 02:36:06.490
AND THEN YOU'RE RIGHT IT IS

02:36:06.557 --> 02:36:07.091
GOING TO TAKE EFFORT TO GET

02:36:07.157 --> 02:36:08.726
PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT

02:36:08.792 --> 02:36:11.028
FLUSHING THESE PRODUCTS -- IS IS

02:36:11.095 --> 02:36:12.296
A PROBLEM.

02:36:12.362 --> 02:36:13.964
BUT UNTIL YOU HAVE UNIFORMITY IN

02:36:14.031 --> 02:36:15.966
YOUR STANDARD YOU REALLY -- EAT

02:36:16.033 --> 02:36:19.636
YOU CAN'T CREDIBLY TELL THE

02:36:19.703 --> 02:36:20.471
PUBLIC THAT SOMETHING CAN'T BE

02:36:20.537 --> 02:36:21.371
FLUSHED IF IT'S NOT MARKED IN A

02:36:21.438 --> 02:36:22.806
WAY THAT THEY THAT THAT IS

02:36:22.873 --> 02:36:23.607
UNDERSTANDABLE.

02:36:23.674 --> 02:36:26.276
IS THIS I'M I'M JUST WONDERING

02:36:26.343 --> 02:36:28.145
IF THIS IS IT WOULDN'T BE A A

02:36:28.212 --> 02:36:30.481
BETTER -- SORT OF GRADUAL

02:36:30.547 --> 02:36:32.116
APPROACH TO FIRST.

02:36:32.182 --> 02:36:34.618
TRIED TO ESTABLISH WHAT STANDARD

02:36:34.685 --> 02:36:36.353
IS GOING TO BE USED AND THEN

02:36:36.420 --> 02:36:38.122
ONCE WE GET PAST THAT POINT THEN

02:36:38.188 --> 02:36:42.092
TALK ABOUT.

02:36:42.159 --> 02:36:42.726
THE LABELING WELL I THINK THIS

02:36:42.793 --> 02:36:43.627
IS A GRADUAL APPROACH I DON'T

02:36:43.694 --> 02:36:44.394
KNOW HOW YOU START WITH ANYTHING

02:36:44.461 --> 02:36:48.398
BECAUSE OF MORE GRADUAL THANJUST LABELING THINGS --

02:36:48.465 --> 02:36:49.032
APPROPRIATE WILL THAT WE DON'T

02:36:49.099 --> 02:36:50.000
HAVE AS I THINK IT WAS

02:36:50.067 --> 02:36:53.270
REPEATEDLY STATED -- OF BY THE

02:36:53.337 --> 02:36:54.838
OPPOSITION THAT -- TO THAT THIS

02:36:54.905 --> 02:36:59.409
BILL WAS A BAN ON SOMETHING -- I

02:36:59.476 --> 02:37:01.545
THINK YOU ALL KNOW -- I'VE DONE

02:37:01.612 --> 02:37:04.481
TAX BILLS I'VE DONE A LOT OF

02:37:04.548 --> 02:37:06.850
I'VE I'VE BAND A LOT OF THINGS

02:37:06.917 --> 02:37:09.520
THAT -- AT ONE POINT I HAD A

02:37:09.586 --> 02:37:11.388
NICKNAME SENATE ALONE.

02:37:11.455 --> 02:37:12.856
NO IT'S BEEN A BLOOM -- SO I

02:37:12.923 --> 02:37:14.591
KNOW WHAT ABANDONED THIS IS NOT

02:37:14.658 --> 02:37:17.060
A BAND THIS IS A LABELING BILL

02:37:17.127 --> 02:37:19.129
THAT -- ALLOWS PEOPLE TO

02:37:19.196 --> 02:37:20.397
UNDERSTAND CONSUMERS TO

02:37:20.464 --> 02:37:21.565
UNDERSTAND.

02:37:21.632 --> 02:37:28.705
WHAT IS POSSIBLE AND WHAT IS NOT?

02:37:28.772 --> 02:37:34.578
THAT SIMPLE.

02:37:34.645 --> 02:37:35.012
ALL RIGHT.

02:37:35.078 --> 02:37:35.679
YOU KNOW MY NAME THIS IS THIS IS

02:37:35.746 --> 02:37:36.213
AN ISSUE THAT WE CAN ALL

02:37:36.280 --> 02:37:37.147
UNDERSTAND SO THERE'S LOTS OF

02:37:37.214 --> 02:37:38.015
QUESTIONS [inaudible] TWO

02:37:38.081 --> 02:37:38.949
DOLLARS.

02:37:39.016 --> 02:37:40.450
SO -- SOME MEMORABLE MY I'M

02:37:40.517 --> 02:37:41.418
KINDA IN THE SAME MAYBE.

02:37:41.485 --> 02:37:43.921
CONFUSION OF MY COLLEAGUE --

02:37:43.987 --> 02:37:45.389
MISS MELINDA SO WHEN I DO FEAR

02:37:45.455 --> 02:37:46.623
CONFUSION.

02:37:46.690 --> 02:37:48.292
WELL SO CAN YOU CAN YOU CAN CAN

02:37:48.358 --> 02:37:49.459
YOU DETERMINE WHEN YOU CLEAN A

02:37:49.526 --> 02:37:50.861
CLOG OUT WHETHER IT WAS A NON

02:37:50.928 --> 02:37:54.097
FLUSHABLE WIFE OR A FLUSHABLE

YEAH NOT THE FOG OKAY YES THERE

02:37:57.768 --> 02:38:03.140
ARE -- DESPITE WHAT WE'VE BEEN

02:38:03.207 --> 02:38:03.707
HEARING THERE ARE -- FIELD

02:38:03.774 --> 02:38:08.011
STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED

02:38:08.078 --> 02:38:08.912
THAT -- DEMONSTRATE.

02:38:08.979 --> 02:38:10.047
SEVERAL IFFERENT TYPES OF

02:38:10.113 --> 02:38:12.282
FLUSHABLE LABELED WIPES GOING

02:38:12.349 --> 02:38:14.051
THROUGH THE SYSTEM AND SHOWING

02:38:14.117 --> 02:38:14.751
UP.

02:38:14.818 --> 02:38:16.453
AT THE TREATMENT PLANT FULLY

02:38:16.520 --> 02:38:18.856
INTACT SOME TO DISPERSE -- A

02:38:18.922 --> 02:38:20.190
LITTLE BIT OTHERS JUST BURST

02:38:20.257 --> 02:38:22.392
COMPLETELY -- BUT WE CERTAINLY

02:38:22.459 --> 02:38:23.994
DO HAVE THE EVIDENCE TO SHOW

02:38:24.061 --> 02:38:26.830
THAT NOT ALL OF THEM MEET THOSE

02:38:26.897 --> 02:38:30.167
HI PERFORMANCE AND METRICS AND

02:38:30.234 --> 02:38:33.036
THEY THEY THERE IS A VERY LARGE

02:38:33.103 --> 02:38:34.905
VERY AUNTS AND HOW THEY PERFORM --

02:38:34.972 --> 02:38:36.707
AND THEN ANECDOTALLY YOU KNOW WE

02:38:36.773 --> 02:38:38.375
DON'T HAVE ANY REASON TO BE

02:38:38.442 --> 02:38:40.043
MAKING UP THIS PROBLEM.

02:38:40.110 --> 02:38:41.545
OUR FOLKS IN.

02:38:41.612 --> 02:38:45.148
THE SEWER -- SYSTEM --

02:38:45.215 --> 02:38:47.651
OPERATIONS DEPARTMENTS -- THE

02:38:47.718 --> 02:38:49.686
REPORT SEEING THESE FLUSHABLE

02:38:49.753 --> 02:38:51.955

BEING PART OF THE RAGS ALL THE

02:38:54.191 --> 02:38:56.526
TIME I GOTAN EMAIL FROM.

02:38:56.593 --> 02:38:58.028
ON THE LONG BEACH TREATMENT

02:38:58.095 --> 02:38:59.429
PLANT JUST LAST WEEK SH

02:38:59.496 --> 02:39:02.633
DEMONSTRATING A RAG A CONDO AND

02:39:02.699 --> 02:39:04.902
EXPLICITLY STATING BY THE WAY A

02:39:04.968 --> 02:39:07.304
LOT OF THE RAGS THAT YOU SEE IN.

02:39:07.371 --> 02:39:09.339
THIS MASS OF PRODUCTS ARE THE

02:39:09.406 --> 02:39:10.974
FLUSHABLE TYPES THERE'S NO

02:39:11.041 --> 02:39:14.011
REASON TO MAKE THAT UP -- AND WE

02:39:14.077 --> 02:39:16.313
KNOW FROM OUR EXPERIENCE -- THAT

02:39:16.380 --> 02:39:18.315
THAT IT THAT IT IS A PROBLEM AND

02:39:18.382 --> 02:39:20.817
THAT -- YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE'S

02:39:20.884 --> 02:39:23.353
NO STATUTORY REQUIREMENT --

02:39:23.420 --> 02:39:25.088
THERE'S NOTHING HOLDING THESE

02:39:25.155 --> 02:39:27.024
COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR HOW

02:39:27.090 --> 02:39:29.526
THEIR LABELING THESE PRODUCTS

02:39:29.593 --> 02:39:31.962
AND YOU CAN LABEL A GOLF BALL AS

02:39:32.029 --> 02:39:33.497
FLUSHABLE AT THE MOMENT AND

02:39:33.563 --> 02:39:35.232
THERE'S NOTHING SAYING YOU CAN'T

02:39:35.299 --> 02:39:37.501
DO THAT -- SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING

02:39:37.567 --> 02:39:38.936
IS THERE JUST NEEDS TO BE A

02:39:39.002 --> 02:39:41.972
CLEAR CONSISTENT LABELLING

02:39:42.039 --> 02:39:43.540
REQUIREMENTS -- THAT.

02:39:43.607 --> 02:39:45.242
THE EXPRESSLY STATE THAT --

02:39:45.309 --> 02:39:47.144
FLUSHABLE PRODUCT -- CAN BE

02:39:47.210 --> 02:39:49.079
CALLED FLUSHABLE IF IT ACTUALLY

02:39:49.146 --> 02:39:50.881
DISBURSES IN THE SYSTEM

02:39:50.948 --> 02:39:54.418
APPROPRIATELY AND DOESN'T CAUSE

02:39:54.484 --> 02:39:55.585
DAMAGE.

02:39:55.652 --> 02:39:57.988
OKAY MY SECOND FOLLOW UP TO THAT

02:39:58.055 --> 02:39:59.489
IS SO.

02:39:59.556 --> 02:40:00.724
I THINK WE HAVE A REALLY THE

02:40:00.791 --> 02:40:02.926
WELL TWO THINGS I THINK IS THE

02:40:02.993 --> 02:40:04.761
ISSUE IS THE NUMBER.

02:40:04.828 --> 02:40:06.396
ONE THE THE PUBLIC IS NOT

02:40:06.463 --> 02:40:10.667
EDUCATED ON I'M ASSUMING A

02:40:10.734 --> 02:40:12.169
MAJORITY OF FLASH NON FLUSHABLE

02:40:12.235 --> 02:40:13.370
GET FLASHED NUMBER ONE AND

02:40:13.437 --> 02:40:13.937
NUMBER TWO MAYBE.

02:40:14.004 --> 02:40:16.740
SOME OF THE STOP THIS DETERMINE

02:40:16.807 --> 02:40:19.009
POSSIBLE ISN'T REALLY SUITABLE

02:40:19.076 --> 02:40:20.377
FOR OUR SYSTEM MAYBE AND I KNOW

02:40:20.444 --> 02:40:21.912
THAT TOM.

02:40:21.979 --> 02:40:23.380
MY EXPERIENCE IN WORKING WITH CS

02:40:23.447 --> 02:40:25.415
DIS OVER THE YEARS.

02:40:25.482 --> 02:40:27.050
AND NOW THAT WE'VE CHANGED OUR

02:40:27.117 --> 02:40:29.152
POLICIES TO LOW FLOW SYSTEMS WE

02:40:29.219 --> 02:40:34.758
DON'T HAVE THE VOLUME OF WATER

02:40:34.825 --> 02:40:35.092
TO ACTUALLY.

02:40:35.158 --> 02:40:35.292
MOVE.

02:40:35.359 --> 02:40:35.926
THE PRODUCTS THROUGH THE SYSTEMS

02:40:35.993 --> 02:40:36.560
THAT WERE DESIGNED FOR A HIGHER

02:40:36.626 --> 02:40:37.160
FLOW OF WATER SO I THINK THAT

02:40:37.227 --> 02:40:38.829
MAYBE HASN'T BEEN TOUCHED ON

02:40:38.895 --> 02:40:40.964
HERE WHICH IS NOT A PROBLEM OF

02:40:41.031 --> 02:40:42.866
THE FLUSHABLE SO.

02:40:42.933 --> 02:40:44.568
IT'S A PROBLEM OF WE JUST ARE

02:40:44.634 --> 02:40:46.703
REDUCING OUR AMOUNT OF WATER AND

02:40:46.770 --> 02:40:49.106
BE ABLE TO TAKE THE AFFLUENT.

02:40:49.172 --> 02:40:51.208
AND DEBRIS AND MOVE IT THROUGH

02:40:51.274 --> 02:40:53.744
THE SYSTEM.THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WIDE LIKE

02:40:53.810 --> 02:40:55.545
TO MAYBE TOUCH ON THE OTHER

02:40:55.612 --> 02:40:56.113
THING.

02:40:56.179 --> 02:40:57.948
THE OTHER THING I THINK THIS.

02:40:58.015 --> 02:40:58.582
CONCERNING TO ME IN THE BILL IS

02:40:58.648 --> 02:41:00.617
THAT.

02:41:00.684 --> 02:41:02.085

02:41:17.868 --> 02:41:18.368
HUNDRED DOLLARS.

02:41:18.435 --> 02:41:19.836
VIOLATION BY THE ATTORNEY

02:41:19.903 --> 02:41:20.537
GENERAL THAT'S LOOK AT THE OTHER

02:41:20.604 --> 02:41:21.138
DAY I WANT TO I WANT TO GET

02:41:21.204 --> 02:41:22.572
THESE OUT OF THE SYSTEM.

02:41:22.639 --> 02:41:25.208
I WANT POSSIBLES TO WORK I WANT.

02:41:25.275 --> 02:41:26.510
TO OUR COMMUNITY TO UNDERSTAND

02:41:26.576 --> 02:41:27.778
IT BUT I THINK THIS.

02:41:27.844 --> 02:41:35.118
IS -- PRETTY AGGRESSIVE AND I

02:41:35.185 --> 02:41:35.919
THINK WE HAVE MAINLY A

02:41:35.986 --> 02:41:36.486
COMMUNICATION PROBLEM OR A

02:41:36.553 --> 02:41:37.888
PUBLIC NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT.

02:41:37.954 --> 02:41:39.356
WHAT THE WHAT THEY SHOULD AND

02:41:39.423 --> 02:41:40.857
SHOULDN'T FLY SO?

02:41:40.924 --> 02:41:42.993
IT'S REALLY MAKING IT ME HARD TO

02:41:43.060 --> 02:41:44.194
GET TO A POINT WHERE I CAN.

02:41:44.261 --> 02:41:45.595
BUY ONE SOLVE THE PROBLEM BUT I

02:41:45.662 --> 02:41:47.030
THINK THIS IS MAYBE.

02:41:47.097 --> 02:41:48.799
NOT QUITE THE RIGHT APPROACH

02:41:48.865 --> 02:41:49.966
WELL I LET ME SEE IF I CAN HELP

02:41:50.033 --> 02:41:52.102
A AND M'S GOVERNMENT WANT TO ADD

02:41:52.169 --> 02:41:52.736
TO THIS BUT THE BILL IS BEING

02:41:52.803 --> 02:41:55.772
AMENDED -- THE PENALTY LANGUAGE

02:41:55.839 --> 02:41:58.075
IS THE IS THE SUBJECT OF THE

02:41:58.141 --> 02:41:59.843
AMENDMENTS HANDED OUT THAT I DID

02:41:59.910 --> 02:42:00.844
GET A CHANCE TO READ.

02:42:00.911 --> 02:42:02.712
OKAY THANK YOU THE AG WILL STILL

02:42:02.779 --> 02:42:05.549
HAVE ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY BUT A

02:42:05.615 --> 02:42:06.083
LOT OF THE OTHER LANGUAGES

02:42:06.149 --> 02:42:09.586
REMOVED.

02:42:09.653 --> 02:42:12.289
ALL RIGHT -- NEXT IS MISS GARCIA

02:42:12.355 --> 02:42:15.859
AND THEN MISTER -- MATHIS COULD

02:42:15.926 --> 02:42:17.627
YOU ADDRESS THAT FLOW ISSUE THAT

02:42:17.694 --> 02:42:18.261
YEAH I'M SORRY.

02:42:18.328 --> 02:42:20.163
FIRST ACTUALLY -- THE LOW FLOWS

02:42:20.230 --> 02:42:21.998
ISSUE IS -- REALLY INTERESTING

02:42:22.065 --> 02:42:23.233
LIKE YOU MENTIONED CALIFORNIA

02:42:23.300 --> 02:42:27.270
HAS -- A LOT OF CONSERVATION AND

02:42:27.337 --> 02:42:29.473
SO INDEED THE FLOWS ARE MUCH

02:42:29.539 --> 02:42:31.274
LOWER HERE -- IN RELATION TO

02:42:31.341 --> 02:42:34.478
WHAT THEY MAY BE IN OTHER PARTS

02:42:34.544 --> 02:42:35.045
OF THE COUNTRY WHERE SOME OF

02:42:35.112 --> 02:42:35.545
THESE STUDIES.

02:42:35.612 --> 02:42:38.115
HAVE BEEN DONE -- THAT ACTUALLY

02:42:38.181 --> 02:42:40.217
IS FAVORABLE TO THE STANDARD

02:42:40.283 --> 02:42:41.885
THAT WE'RE PROPOSING BECAUSE THE

02:42:41.952 --> 02:42:43.753
STANDARD THAT WE'RE PROPOSING --

02:42:43.820 --> 02:42:45.388
ONE OF THE METHODOLOGIES

02:42:45.455 --> 02:42:48.859
REQUIRES -- SORT OF A GENTLER

02:42:48.925 --> 02:42:50.494
TURBULENCE IF YOU WILL WHEN

02:42:50.560 --> 02:42:52.762
YOU'RE TESTING THE PRODUCT --

02:42:52.829 --> 02:42:54.331
AND SO THAT WOULD BE MORE

02:42:54.397 --> 02:42:56.333
REFLECTIVE OF THE SEWER SYSTEM

02:42:56.399 --> 02:42:58.502
WITH LOWER FLOWS AND THEN WHEN

02:42:58.568 --> 02:42:59.402
YOU HAVE LOWER FLOWS CLEARLY

02:42:59.469 --> 02:43:01.438
THERE'S MORE DEBRIS IT TAKES

02:43:01.505 --> 02:43:02.772
LONGER FOR IT TO MOVE IN THERE

02:43:02.839 --> 02:43:04.808
MORE OPPORTUNITIES.

02:43:04.875 --> 02:43:07.444
FOR THE WHITES TO GET CAUGHT AND

02:43:07.511 --> 02:43:09.980
IN THE PROCESS.

02:43:10.046 --> 02:43:11.948
SO THAT'S MY POINT IS THAT WE'VE

02:43:12.015 --> 02:43:14.417
BECAUSE THIS BY LOW FLOWS NOT SO

02:43:14.484 --> 02:43:16.453
NECESSARY THE MANUFACTURE SO I

02:43:16.520 --> 02:43:18.755
THINK WE WE SHOULD HAVE SOME

02:43:18.822 --> 02:43:19.189
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE

02:43:19.256 --> 02:43:21.224
MANUFACTURERS TO A MAYBE TRY.

02:43:21.291 --> 02:43:22.459
TO COMPLY WITH SOMETHING THAT

02:43:22.526 --> 02:43:24.027
THEY DIDN'T REALLY BECAUSE IT'S

02:43:24.094 --> 02:43:25.428
BECAUSE OF THERE'S A LOW FLOW

02:43:25.495 --> 02:43:26.997
THAT'S BECAUSE THE ISSUE AND

02:43:27.063 --> 02:43:28.498
WHEN YOU HAVE LOW FLOW AT LEAST.

02:43:28.565 --> 02:43:29.933
AGAIN I ACTUALLY WORKED WITH

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:31.168
COMMUNITY SERVICE DISTRICTS YOU

02:43:31.234 --> 02:43:32.736
ARE FACED WITH THIS.

02:43:32.802 --> 02:43:34.204
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH FLOW SO IT

02:43:34.271 --> 02:43:35.639
PILES UP AND THEN WHEN YOU DO

02:43:35.705 --> 02:43:38.108
GET FLOW IT'S SLUGS THE SYSTEM

02:43:38.175 --> 02:43:39.910
AND YOU GET THESE CLOCKS.

02:43:39.976 --> 02:43:40.744
THAT'S NOT THE MANUFACTURER'S

02:43:40.810 --> 02:43:42.345
FAULT.

02:43:42.412 --> 02:43:45.615
MAYBE IT'S A CONSEQUENCES OF THE

02:43:45.682 --> 02:43:47.551
ENVIRONMENT WE'RE IN BUT I THINK

02:43:47.617 --> 02:43:48.885
WE SHOULD NOT PENALIZE THE

02:43:48.952 --> 02:43:50.887
MANUFACTURES BECAUSE WE'VE.

02:43:50.954 --> 02:43:53.056
CONCERT AND DONE A GREAT JOB OF

02:43:53.123 --> 02:43:54.791
CONSERVING WATER WHICH IS THE

02:43:54.858 --> 02:43:57.460
MAIN PRODUCT THAT MOVED THE

02:43:57.527 --> 02:43:59.629
AFFLUENT OUT TO THESE PROCESSING

02:43:59.696 --> 02:44:08.438
PLANTS [inaudible]

02:44:08.505 --> 02:44:10.173
OKAY.

02:44:10.240 --> 02:44:12.242
GARCIA YEAH MISTER BLOOM MEET

BUT I WILL BE VOTING FOR THE FOR

02:44:20.984 --> 02:44:23.053
THE BILL TO DAVID I'M A LITTLE

02:44:23.119 --> 02:44:23.720
GRUMPY SO I APOLOGIZE IF I'M NOT

JIM LOFTIS WHEN I WAS THE FORMER

02:45:13.770 --> 02:45:15.639
TECHNICAL DIRECTOR OF AND I WAS

02:45:15.705 --> 02:45:16.539
SAID INTO FOR THREE AND A HALF

02:45:16.606 --> 02:45:17.140
YEARS.

02:45:17.207 --> 02:45:19.209

FOURTH EDITION OF THE GUIDANCE

02:45:19.909 --> 02:45:21.111
DOCUMENT.

02:45:21.177 --> 02:45:22.312
THE SINGLE BIGGEST ISSUE I THINK

02:45:22.379 --> 02:45:24.914
WITH THE I. W. S. OF G. STANDARD

02:45:24.981 --> 02:45:25.882
WHICH IS THE INTERNATIONAL

02:45:25.949 --> 02:45:27.684
INTERNATIONAL WASTE WATER.

02:45:27.751 --> 02:45:29.386
AND ASSEMBLYMAN BLOOM MENTION

02:45:29.452 --> 02:45:31.154
THAT THIS IS IN A BAND EXCEPT

02:45:31.221 --> 02:45:33.690
THAT THAT -- STANDARD

02:45:33.757 --> 02:45:37.527
ESSENTIALLY -- FAILS EVERY --

02:45:37.594 --> 02:45:39.562
NONWOVEN DISPERSIBLE FLUSHABLE

02:45:39.629 --> 02:45:41.031
WIPES THAT'S ON THE MARKET IN

02:45:41.097 --> 02:45:43.533
NORTH AMERICA TODAY -- AND SO

02:45:43.600 --> 02:45:44.768
THE OTHER STANDARD WHICH IS THE

02:45:44.834 --> 02:45:46.336
IN THE IT ON A STANDARD WHICH

02:45:46.403 --> 02:45:48.772
WAS DEVELOPED -- NOT ONLY BY

02:45:48.838 --> 02:45:50.740
INDUSTRY BUT THIS IS THE FOURTH

02:45:50.807 --> 02:45:52.108
ADDITION AND WE SPENT A

02:45:52.175 --> 02:45:53.076
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TIME

02:45:53.143 --> 02:45:54.311
TALKING.

02:45:54.377 --> 02:45:55.945
TO THOSE IN THE WATER SERVICES

02:45:56.012 --> 02:45:57.580
INDUSTRY OVER THOSE YEARS THIS

02:45:57.647 --> 02:46:00.016
WORK HAS GONE BACK TO TWO

02:46:00.083 --> 02:46:00.850
THOUSAND AND TWO AND SO WHEN YOU

02:46:00.917 --> 02:46:03.153
LOOK AT THAT STANDARD WHEN YOU

02:46:03.219 --> 02:46:03.687
LOOK AT THE IN THE IT ON A

02:46:03.753 --> 02:46:05.922
STANDARD -- THE WIPES THAT

02:46:05.989 --> 02:46:07.691
PASSED THAT STANDARD HAVE NEVER

02:46:07.757 --> 02:46:10.193
BEEN SHOWN TO CAUSE THESE ISSUES.

02:46:10.260 --> 02:46:12.062
RIGHT WE WE'VE NOT WE'VE ASKED

02:46:12.128 --> 02:46:13.496
FOR DATA WE'VE ASKED FOR

02:46:13.563 --> 02:46:15.198
INFORMATION THAT WOULD SAY YES

02:46:15.265 --> 02:46:16.800
THAT FLUSH WIPE THAT PASSED

02:46:16.866 --> 02:46:19.636
EITHER GT THREE OR NOW GT.

02:46:19.703 --> 02:46:21.171
FOUR IT IS THE CAUSE OF THAT

02:46:21.237 --> 02:46:22.939
ISSUE AND AND WE'VE NOT SEEN

02:46:23.006 --> 02:46:23.573
THOSE.

02:46:23.640 --> 02:46:26.443
THE INDIVIDUALS IN EUROPE THE

02:46:26.509 --> 02:46:28.645
THERE'S INTO ANY DONNY DON IS

02:46:28.712 --> 02:46:30.680
THE EUROPEAN NONWOVENS

02:46:30.747 --> 02:46:32.482
ASSOCIATION WE'VE WORKING

02:46:32.549 --> 02:46:34.017
JOINTLY WITH THIS -- WE'VE

02:46:34.084 --> 02:46:36.186
ENGAGED -- WASTE WATER

02:46:36.252 --> 02:46:37.620
PROFESSIONALS IN BOTH THE

02:46:37.687 --> 02:46:41.224
EUROPEAN UNION AS WELL AS IN IN

02:46:41.291 --> 02:46:43.827
THE U. S. AND THE THE RESPONSE

02:46:43.893 --> 02:46:45.362
FROM THE FOLKS IN EUROPE IS.

02:46:45.428 --> 02:46:50.066
LOOK WEAK WE STANDARDS TO BE

02:46:50.133 --> 02:46:52.068
GOOD ENOUGH TO SEPARATE OUT

02:46:52.135 --> 02:46:54.971
THOSE NON FLUSHABLE MATERIALS

02:46:55.038 --> 02:46:56.306
WHICH HAVE VERY VERY HIGH WHAT

02:46:56.373 --> 02:46:58.041
STRENGTH LIKE THE BABY WIPES

02:46:58.108 --> 02:47:00.310
WHICH WE NOW WE'VE WE DID SOME

02:47:00.377 --> 02:47:02.112
TESTING WHERE WE TOOK BABY WIPES

02:47:02.178 --> 02:47:03.580
WE CLOGGED IN EIGHTEEN HORSE

02:47:03.646 --> 02:47:04.347
POWER PUMP.

02:47:04.414 --> 02:47:06.683
WITH BABY WIPES WE KNOW THOSE

02:47:06.750 --> 02:47:08.251
BECAUSE ISSUES IN THE SYSTEM.

02:47:08.318 --> 02:47:09.919
AND THEN THERE'S THE LOW WHAT

02:47:09.986 --> 02:47:10.987
STRENGTH WIPES WHICH ARE THE

02:47:11.054 --> 02:47:12.322
FLUSHABLE WIPES.

02:47:12.389 --> 02:47:13.256
THE FOLKS IN EUROPE THAT WE

02:47:13.323 --> 02:47:15.058
SPOKE TO THEY UNDERSTAND THAT

02:47:15.125 --> 02:47:16.659
THOSE AREN'T THE PROBLEMS.

02:47:16.726 --> 02:47:18.128
THE PROBLEMS THAT EXIST OR THE

02:47:18.194 --> 02:47:19.662
MATERIALS THAT ARE BEING FLASHED

02:47:19.729 --> 02:47:20.830
THAT SHOULD NEVER BE IN YOUR

02:47:20.897 --> 02:47:22.298
SYSTEMS IN THE FIRST PLACE.

02:47:22.365 --> 02:47:23.800
THAT'S THE ISSUE AND WE'VE

02:47:23.867 --> 02:47:26.269
TALKED ABOUT THIS EDUCATION

02:47:26.336 --> 02:47:28.104
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO.

02:47:28.171 --> 02:47:29.739
I TAUGHT A COURSE THAT IN THE

02:47:29.806 --> 02:47:31.608
AND I BROUGHT THIS UP THIS WHOLE

02:47:31.674 --> 02:47:33.943
PART I THINK YOU'VE ANSWERED THE

02:47:34.010 --> 02:47:34.210
QUESTION.

02:47:34.277 --> 02:47:38.548
OUR I I WILL ALSO SAY THAT --

02:47:38.615 --> 02:47:39.449
THE SPONSORS WILL TELL YOU THAT

02:47:39.516 --> 02:47:41.885
THEY HAVE FOUND.

02:47:41.951 --> 02:47:43.920
WIPES THAT ARE FLOOD SUPPOSEDLY

02:47:43.987 --> 02:47:45.588
FLAT WELL I'LL TELL YOU.

02:47:45.655 --> 02:47:47.690

02:48:06.843 --> 02:48:09.813
OBVIOUSLY THE PROPONENTS FEEL

02:48:09.879 --> 02:48:10.914
THAT.

02:48:10.980 --> 02:48:12.816
THEY DO HAVE GOOD EVIDENCE THAT

02:48:24.961 --> 02:48:26.229

02:49:17.447 --> 02:49:18.581
THEY'RE THEY'RE USUALLY SEPARATE

02:49:18.648 --> 02:49:23.186
FROM -- REGULAR WIPES IN IN

MISSILE AND IS IS IS BROUGHT IN --

02:49:30.126 --> 02:49:31.060
BUT I'M JUST TRYING TO IMAGINE A

02:49:31.127 --> 02:49:33.530
WORLD WHERE.

02:49:33.596 --> 02:49:35.098
YOU KNOW ME AND MY WIFE HAVE TO

02:49:35.164 --> 02:49:37.267
TAKE CARE OF OUR CHILD.

02:49:37.333 --> 02:49:39.068
WHO DOESN'T HAVE CONTROL OVER

02:49:39.135 --> 02:49:40.436

02:49:42.338 --> 02:49:44.073
WHERE WE'RE GONNA HAVE A HUGE

02:49:44.140 --> 02:49:46.776
MASSIVE PILE OF OF REGULAR WIPES?

02:49:46.843 --> 02:49:48.244
THE COULD COLLECT WHILE WE'RE

02:49:48.311 --> 02:49:50.113
HAVING TO DO WITH HIS NIGHTLY

02:49:50.179 --> 02:49:54.384
ROUTINES -- IT AND HE'S LIKE.

02:49:54.450 --> 02:49:54.984
FOR SO I'M TRYING TO THINK OF

02:49:55.051 --> 02:49:56.085
WHAT THAT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE

02:49:56.152 --> 02:49:57.287
FOR ANY AND ADULTS.

02:49:57.353 --> 02:50:00.223
WHO HAS SIMILAR PROBLEMS AND AND

02:50:00.290 --> 02:50:01.457
THOSE THINGS?

02:50:01.524 --> 02:50:03.526
IN OUR AND AND LOOKING AT THE

02:50:03.593 --> 02:50:04.894
THE BACK AND FORTH IN THE SENATE

02:50:04.961 --> 02:50:07.163
ALL OF THIS I MEAN THERE'S

02:50:07.230 --> 02:50:10.099
CLEARLY WAYS WHERE ON THE

02:50:10.166 --> 02:50:12.735
MANUFACTURINGSIDE.

02:50:12.802 --> 02:50:14.203
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S WAYS THE CAN

02:50:14.270 --> 02:50:15.838
DO BETTER JOBS ON ON THE WAY

02:50:15.905 --> 02:50:16.839
THINGS ARE MANUFACTURED.

02:50:16.906 --> 02:50:19.142
BUT AT THE SAME TIME I I THINK.

02:50:19.208 --> 02:50:21.511
FALL IN THINGS OFF THE SHELF

02:50:21.578 --> 02:50:23.212
CREE PENALTIES DOING THIS IT'S

02:50:23.279 --> 02:50:25.815
IT'S DEFINITELY A A STICK VERSES

02:50:25.882 --> 02:50:27.684
A CARROT -- WHICH I'M NOT IN

02:50:27.750 --> 02:50:31.921
FAVOR OF SO I'M TRYING TO REALLY.

02:50:31.988 --> 02:50:34.123
FIGURE OUT WHO IT WITH ALL THE

02:50:34.190 --> 02:50:36.025
WORK THAT I DEAL IN.

02:50:36.092 --> 02:50:36.526
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES

02:50:36.593 --> 02:50:38.494
COMMUNITY.

02:50:38.561 --> 02:50:41.264
HOW THIS IS GONNA AFFECT THEM --

02:50:41.331 --> 02:50:42.465
BECAUSE I COULDN'T IMAGINE

02:50:42.532 --> 02:50:44.500
SOMEBODY TRYING TO GO IN AND AND

02:50:44.567 --> 02:50:46.069
GET WIVES WITH WITH A LITTLE BIT

02:50:46.135 --> 02:50:47.770
OF TIME THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO

02:50:47.837 --> 02:50:48.771
GET TO THE STORE.

02:50:48.838 --> 02:50:49.772
NOT BE ABLE TO FIND THEM THEM

02:50:49.839 --> 02:50:52.108
NOT BE ON THE SHELVES BECAUSE OF

02:50:52.175 --> 02:50:53.810
THIS TYPE OF LEGISLATION.

02:50:53.876 --> 02:50:56.312
SO THAT THAT'S JUST A CONCERN I

02:50:56.379 --> 02:50:57.647
HAVE.

02:50:57.714 --> 02:50:59.048
A MEASURE YOU'D EMAIL BEEN

02:50:59.115 --> 02:51:00.216
INSURE US THERE'S NOT GONNA BE A

02:51:00.283 --> 02:51:00.883
PROBLEM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT

02:51:00.950 --> 02:51:01.951
BUT IT BUT AS A FATHER THAT

02:51:02.018 --> 02:51:03.519
DEALS WITH THIS ON A DAY TO DAY.

02:51:03.586 --> 02:51:05.488
I HAVE VERY VERY LARGE CONCERN

02:51:05.555 --> 02:51:06.789
AND I DON'T THINK THAT POINT AND

02:51:06.856 --> 02:51:09.959
BROUGHT UP OF HOW OFTEN THESE

02:51:10.026 --> 02:51:11.828
PRODUCTS ARE USED. FOR FOLKS WHO

02:51:11.894 --> 02:51:15.565
DON'T REALLY HAVE ANOTHER CHOICE --

02:51:15.632 --> 02:51:16.532
LET ME.

02:51:16.599 --> 02:51:17.834
I TRY TO ANSWER THAT BUT

02:51:17.900 --> 02:51:19.035
CERTAINLY -- YOU POINT OUT A

02:51:19.102 --> 02:51:21.904
SENSITIVE ISSUE -- BUT IT'S NOT

02:51:21.971 --> 02:51:26.843
NEW ISSUE -- YOU KNOW -- OF

02:51:26.909 --> 02:51:28.411
FOLKS WHO HAVE SPECIAL NEEDS

02:51:28.478 --> 02:51:30.380
HAVE BEEN AROUND OF GOV FOR TIME

02:51:30.446 --> 02:51:32.048
IMMEMORIAL -- ADULTS WHO HAVE

02:51:32.115 --> 02:51:35.451
NEEDS BABIES WHO HAVE DIAPERS.

02:51:35.518 --> 02:51:36.386
YOU KNOW THAT NEED TO BE

02:51:36.452 --> 02:51:37.720
DISPOSED OF SOMEWHERE THIS IS

02:51:37.787 --> 02:51:39.322
ESSENTIALLY A QUESTION OF WHERE

02:51:39.389 --> 02:51:41.257
ARE WE GOING TO DISPOSE OF

02:51:41.324 --> 02:51:43.526
THINGS AND FIFTEEN YEARS AGO

02:51:43.593 --> 02:51:46.462
BEFORE THE THESE PRODUCTS WERE

02:51:46.529 --> 02:51:50.466
WIDELY AVAILABLE WE WERE STILL --

02:51:50.533 --> 02:51:53.069
USING PRODUCTS TO CLEAN THINGS

02:51:53.136 --> 02:51:54.737
UP AND WE WERE DISPOSING OF THEM

02:51:54.804 --> 02:51:56.906
BUT THEY WEREN'T GOING DOWN THE

02:51:56.973 --> 02:51:59.108
TOILET OF A FOR THE MOST PART --

02:51:59.175 --> 02:52:00.677
THEY WERE GOING ELSEWHERE.

02:52:00.743 --> 02:52:03.212
AND YOU KNOW THAT'S REALLY THE

02:52:03.279 --> 02:52:05.815
ADJUSTMENT THAT A YOU KNOW IN

02:52:05.882 --> 02:52:07.417
SOME WAYS WILL -- WILL NEED TO

02:52:07.483 --> 02:52:09.719
BE MADE BUT AGAIN THIS IS ABOUT

02:52:09.786 --> 02:52:12.955
THE COMPOSITION OF PRODUCTS AND

02:52:13.022 --> 02:52:17.126
THERE'S NO REASON WHY -- THE

02:52:17.193 --> 02:52:18.728
FLEXIBILITY STANDARD CANNOT BE

02:52:18.795 --> 02:52:20.930
MET FOR PRODUCTS THAT YOU'LL

02:52:20.997 --> 02:52:23.433
NEED TO USE -- WITHOUT WERE

02:52:23.499 --> 02:52:26.269
SIMPLY POINTING OUT HERE THAT.

02:52:26.335 --> 02:52:28.738
WE ARE AND I THINK AGAIN THIS IS

02:52:28.805 --> 02:52:30.306
A MATTER OF WHERE YOU PLACE THE

02:52:30.373 --> 02:52:31.741
STANDARD AND THERE'S A

02:52:31.808 --> 02:52:33.609
SIGNIFICANT DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN

02:52:33.676 --> 02:52:36.612
THE TWO SIDES HERE -- BETWEEN

02:52:36.679 --> 02:52:37.780
THE ODDS OF YOU KNOW MY POINT OF

02:52:37.847 --> 02:52:39.182
VIEW AND THE AND THE OPPOSITION

02:52:39.248 --> 02:52:41.284
BUT THE QUESTION IS WHERE DO YOU

02:52:41.350 --> 02:52:43.419
DRAW THE LINE NOT SHOULD

02:52:43.486 --> 02:52:47.824
EVERYTHING GO IN THE TOILET AND

02:52:47.890 --> 02:52:48.925
TO BE WASHED INTO THE SEWERS AND

02:52:48.991 --> 02:52:49.859
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY IS

02:52:49.926 --> 02:52:50.960
ADVOCATING THAT EVERYTHING GOES

02:52:51.027 --> 02:52:57.366
INTHE TOILET.

02:52:57.433 --> 02:52:58.968
I MEAN.

02:52:59.035 --> 02:53:00.937
WE WE ALL KIND OF GREW UP WITH

02:53:01.003 --> 02:53:02.405
THAT COMMON SENSE OF IT NOW

02:53:02.472 --> 02:53:03.039
FASHIONING DOWN THE TOILET THAT

02:53:03.106 --> 02:53:03.706
DOESN'T NEED TO GET FLUSHED DOWN

02:53:03.773 --> 02:53:05.074
THE TOILET RIGHT AND MOST OF US

02:53:05.141 --> 02:53:06.576
GREW UP WITH THAT AND MAYBE SOME

02:53:06.642 --> 02:53:07.276
OF THAT GOES BACK IN THE

02:53:07.343 --> 02:53:08.878
EDUCATION SYSTEM AND AND PARENTS

02:53:08.945 --> 02:53:09.078
BEING.

02:53:09.145 --> 02:53:09.645
PARENTS ACTUALLY TEACHING.

02:53:09.712 --> 02:53:12.515
THEIR KIDS THESE THINGS.

02:53:12.582 --> 02:53:14.317
YOU KNOW I I THINK MORE MAYBE.

02:53:14.383 --> 02:53:14.951
A ENOUGH YOUR BILL SAID OKAY IF

02:53:15.017 --> 02:53:16.219
IT'S GOING TO HAVE THE LABEL

02:53:16.285 --> 02:53:17.186
THAT IT'S FLUSHABLE THAN IT MEET

02:53:17.253 --> 02:53:18.588
THE REQUIREMENTS BUT THE THE NON

02:53:18.654 --> 02:53:19.889
FLUSHABLE WIFE ON ON THE OTHER

02:53:19.956 --> 02:53:21.457
SIDE OF IT IS IS.

02:53:21.524 --> 02:53:24.527
THAT'S WHERE GETS.

02:53:24.594 --> 02:53:25.595
A LOT MORE CONFUSING WITH IT SO

02:53:25.661 --> 02:53:28.097
OKAY THANK YOU AT THAT

02:53:28.164 --> 02:53:28.664
ESSENTIALLY IS WHAT THE BILL

02:53:28.731 --> 02:53:29.065
DOES.

02:53:29.132 --> 02:53:30.133
I'M I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE
