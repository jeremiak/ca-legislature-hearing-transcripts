I HAVE. WE ARE GONNA START AS A SUBCOMMITTEE. OF THE COMMITTEE TO BEGIN HEAR TESTIMONY AND FILLS. I WANT ANNOUNCED FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PUBLIC. THAT ITEMS FIVE AND SEVEN BOTH SB TEN SEVENTY TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER PATTERSON. AND SB FIFTEEN THIRTEEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN. HAVE BEEN HELD IN COMMITTEE NOW I'M JUST JOKING. THAT THEY'VE BEEN THE THEY'VE BEEN MOVED TO THE CONSENT CALENDAR -- ITEMS FIVE AND SEVEN NO NO I'M SORRY. HELLO I TO ME SORRY ABOUT THAT. OKAY SO WE WILL BEGIN WITH -- ITEM NUMBER ONE A. B. FIVE TWENTY THREE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN WELCOME GOOD MORNING. MORNING CHAIR HUESO AND SENATORS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT TO AB FIVE TWO THREE THIS MORNING THIS BILL IS IN RESPONSE TO TROUBLING INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM THAT UNCOVERED THE PRACTICE OF SELLING TELECOMMUNICATIONS -- INFORMATION -- REAL TIME -- DATA LOCATION OF THE OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES SELLING REAL TIME INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR SUBSCRIBERS REAL TIME DATA INFORMATION. THIS INFORMATION WAS AND PACKAGE AND RESOLD BY MIDDLEMAN TO ANYONE WILLING TO PAY USUALLY BOUNTY HUNTERS. AND OTHERS WITH AN INTERESTED IN FINDING. OR STOCKING INDIVIDUALS I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR HELPING TO BETTER REFINE THE BILL THROUGH AMENDMENTS THAT I WILL BE TAKING AS THE BILL MOVES -- FROM THIS COMMITTEE AND HEADS TO JUDICIARY. COPIES OF THE AMENDMENT MOCK UPS ARE BEING MADE AVAILABLE FROM THE COMMITTEE STAFF. AND SINCE OF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THEM YET I WOULD LIKE TO BRIEFLY TALK ABOUT THESE AMENDMENTS THESE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. THEY WOULD SUBSTITUTE THE CURRENT LANGUAGE OF THE BILL AND DO THE FOLLOWING PROHIBIT A WIRELESS TELECOM PROVIDER OR ANY DIRECT OR INDIRECT AFFILIATE OF A PROVIDER FROM DISCLOSING CELL SITE LOCATION INFORMATION TO ANY PARTY. WITHOUT FIRST OBTAINING THE SUBSCRIBERS EXPRESS CONSENT. PROVIDE EXCEPTIONS TO THIS DISCLOSURE SOLELY FOR NINE ONE ONE PURPOSES AND PURSUANT TO A WARRANT. SPECIFIED THAT THE EXPRESSED CONSENT MUST BE OFTEN AND CLEARLY IDENTIFIED THE PARTIES TO WHOM THE INFORMATION WILL BE DISCLOSED IN THE CUSTOMER'S RIGHT TO REVOKE CONSENT AT ANY TIME. ESTABLISH A DUTY FOR TELECOMS TO COMPLY WITH THE REVOCATION OF ITS CONSENT. AND CLARIFY THAT DELIBERATE VIOLATIONS OF THE PROHIBITION ON DISCLOSURE ARE GROUNDS FOR A CIVIL. SUIT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE. THAT UNDER THE CURRENT LAW THIS SAME LOCATION INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH A SEARCH WARRANT. SO THAT'S OF BOUNTY HUNTERS ARE ABLE TO GET THIS INFORMATION FOR A SMALL FEE. IS -- ABSOLUTELY WRONG. A AND AND IT DOES SHOW HOW SENSITIVE THIS INFORMATION IS THAT'S FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT THEY NEED A WARRANT WITH AB FIVE TWO THREE CALIFORNIA'S WILL BE ABLE TO KEEP THEIR REAL TIME LOCATION OF THEIR CELL PHONES PROTECTED AND OUT OF THE HANDS OF STRANGERS [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND DO WE HAVE TESTIMONY. ON THIS BILL ANYBODY IN PUBLIC WISH TO SPEAK IN FAVOR. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS DEEP CARL SOBRE SI TI A THE WIRELESS ASSOCIATION WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS -- AT ONE TO GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON ON ON WHAT HAPPENED -- THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THINGS LIKE ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE -- FIRST ALERT AND THOSE SORTS OF BENEFICIAL CONSUMER SERVICES -- PROVIDED. LOCATION INFORMATION AND THEIR OPINION IT WAS COMMITTEE CUSTOMERS AT OPTED IN TO THE USE OF THE INFORMATION FOR THAT SORT TO A DATA AGGREGATOR. BECAUSE IT WAS A MORE EFFICIENT WAY TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION OUT TO THE VARIOUS ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE AND OTHER OTHER GROUPS -- WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT -- INTO THEIR DISMAY -- THE AGGREGATORS USE THE INFORMATION IN WAYS THAT HAD NOT BEEN AUTHORIZED BY THE WIRELESS COMPANIES THE WIRELESS COMPANIES EAST PROVIDING INFORMATION TO THOSE AGGREGATORS. HAVE STOPPED THAT -- AND IT ALSO WHEN THAT WAY HAVE STOPPED ACTUALLY PROVIDING INFORMATION TO THAT ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE AND SOME OF THOSE OTHER SO I WE THINK THAT THERE'S A POTENTIAL NEGATIVE HERE -- IN WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR WE UNDERSTAND THAT HER ISSUE WAS DEALING WITH. AND YOUR LOCATION INFORMATION WE HAVE AGREED -- TO DEAL TO PROVIDE OPT IN. TO YOUR LOCATION INFORMATION. ARE WE PROVIDED -- WE THOUGHT REASONABLE STRAIGHT FORD AMENDMENTS THAT PROHIBITS SALE TO THIRD PARTIES -- AND EVEN INSURANCE CUSTOMERS WHO ARE HARMED -- CAN BRING SUIT IN STATE COURT UNFORTUNATELY -- THIS LATEST SET OF AMENDMENTS WHICH WE ONLY SAW YESTERDAY AT NOON SO WE HAVEN'T EVEN HAD TWENTY FOUR HOURS TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT. GO WELL BEYOND WHAT WE HAD HOPED AND AND HAD BEEN DISCUSSING WITH THE AUTHOR WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT WE KNOW GOES OVER THE JUDICIARY -- AND IT'S A PRIVACY ISSUE SO -- DO JUDICIARY IS QUITE ACTIVE -- ON THOSE ISSUES -- BUT WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR -- IN THE COMMITTEE -- BUT AT THIS POINT THESE CONCERNS ARE ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT AND AS WE GO FURTHER WILL CONTINUE OUR DISCUSSION BUT FOR NOW WE MUST OPPOSE. VERY WELL MEMBERS. ANYONE OKAY YOU WANT MY CLOSING COMMENTS OF AYE I JUST WANT TO POINT BACK TO THE STORY THAT WAS IN THE NEW YORK TIMES -- WAS PROBABLY SIX MONTHS AGO WHERE ARE A PERSON IN NEW YORK WAS -- ABLE TO COMPLETELY OF FIND EVERY STEP THAT THEY HAD TAKEN EVERYWHERE THAT THEY HAD GONE AND BECAUSE THIS NFORMATION WAS BEING -- RESOLD TO DATA BROKERS REAL TIME INFORMATION IS EXTREMELY SENSITIVE AND IT NEEDS THE ABSOLUTE HIGHEST LEVEL OF PROTECTION AND WITH THIS BILL WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIANS -- TO RECEIVE THAT PROTECTION. THAT IS AMAZING TO KNOW THAT WAS HAPPENING. BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED COMMITMENT. TO TO SECURITY AND TO PROTECTING PEOPLE'S IDENTITIES. AND WILL -- MOVE THE BILL WHEN WE HAVE A FOUR THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIR AND SENATORS ASSEMBLYMEMBER LIVING. ITEM NUMBER TWO AB. SIX SIXTY GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR HOW ARIA. GOOD GOOD GOOD MORNING GOOD THANK YOU GLAD TO BE HERE -- I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I APPRECIATE THE THE BILL ANALYSIS BY THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS THAT WAS REALLY GREAT WORK AND I'M GRATEFUL AND APPRECIATIVE OF IT THANKS. I EIGHTY SIX HE DIRECTS THE ENERGY COMMISSION TO CONSIDER MORE THAN DOUBLING THE SOLAR REFLECTANCE REQUIREMENT FOR STEEP ROOFS ON EXISTING RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS INAPPROPRIATE CLIMATE ZONES BY. TWENTY THIRTY IF THAT IS COST EFFECTIVE. ENERGY EFFICIENT PERSON ON A SCHOOL REUSS THESE ROOFS ARE DESIGNED REFLECT SUNLIGHT ABSORB LESS HEAT. AND AND IN FACT DECREASE -- THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND AND THAT THE CREATION HEAT ISLANDS IN VERY HOT PLACES -- WRIST LAST ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AND SO WE COULD BE ON A CYCLE FOR REDUCING HEAT ISLANDS AND AND INCREASING EFFECTIVENESS VERY QUICKLY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH ME. TODAY IS RUNNING LEVINSON FROM THE LAWRENCE BERKELEY NATIONAL LABORATORY. YES GOOD MORNING THANK YOU -- I'M RENTAL IN CINEMA STAFF SCIENTIST AT LAWRENCE BERKELEY NATIONAL LABORATORY. HOWEVERTHE VIEWS PRESENTED HERE ARE MINE IS AN EXPERT AND ARE NOT INTENDED TO REFLECT ANY POSITION OF LAWRENCE BERKELEY NATIONAL LABORATORY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA OR THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY RESIDENTIAL COOL REQUIREMENTS OF ALL TOO LITTLE SINCE THEY WERE INTRODUCED IN CALIFORNIA'S BUILDING ENERGY EFFICIENCY STANDARDS OVER A DECADE AGO. TITLE TWENTY FOUR PART SIX PRESCRIBE SCHOOL ROUTES FOR HOMES IN ONLY SIX OF THE STATE'S SIXTEEN CLIMATE ZONES BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS. THAT WE HAD LBNL PERFORMED FOR THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TITLE TWENTY FOUR CODE CYCLE INCLUDED TWO KEY ASSUMPTIONS. FIRST IT MODELED NEW HOMES OF WELL INSULATED ROOFS RATHER THAN EXISTING HOMES OF POORLY INSULATED ROOFS. CORPS OF PRODUCTS ARE MOST EFFECTIVEWHEN ROOF SEVERAL INSULATION. SECOND IT MODEL LOWER PERFORMANCE RESIDENTIAL COOL ROOF PRODUCTS WITH AN AGE SOUL REFLECTANCE OF ZERO POINT. TWO ZERO RATHER THAN HIGHER PERFORMANCE RESIDENTIAL PRODUCTS WITH AN H. REFLECTANCE TWICE THAT IS ZERO POINT. FOUR ZERO OR PERFORMANCE RESIDENTIAL COOL ROOF IS NO COR THAN A TYPICAL COMMERCIAL BUILDING GRAY ROOF THEY HAVE THE SAME AGE SOUL REFLECTANCE. AND IS MUCH WARMER THAN A TYPICAL COMMERCIAL BUILDING WHITE ROOF AGE OR FIGHT IS ABOUT ZERO POINT. SIX ZERO A RECENT STUDY PUBLISHED BY LBNL PUBLISHED IN THE PEER REVIEWED JOURNAL ENERGY AND BUILDING FOUND THAT OUR EARLIER ANALYSIS SUBSTANTIALLY UNDERESTIMATED. THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF COOL ROOF RETROFITS FOR HOMEOWNERS TENANTS AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. KEY POINTS ABOUT 90% OF THE RESIDENTIAL ROOF SURFACING MATERIAL SOLD IN CALIFORNIA IS INSTALLED ON EXISTING HOMES. THE BENEFIT OF A COOL RIFF PRODUCT UNDER EXISTING HOME ITS ANNUAL COOLING SAVINGS MINUS THE ANNUAL HEATING PENALTY IS ABOUT TWO TO FOUR TIMES THAT OF THE SAME PRODUCT ON A NEW HOME. ALSO THE BENEFIT OF HIGHER PERFORMANCE COOL ROOF PRODUCT IS ABOUT THREE TIMES THAT OF A LOWER PERFORMANCE SCORES PRODUCTS. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA'S STATEWIDE UTILITY CODES AND STANDARDS PROGRAM STUDY FOUND COMPARABLE PRICES FOR HIGHER PERFORMANCE AND LOWER PERFORMANCE RESIDENTIAL COOL RIFF PRODUCTS. AND ALSO REPORTED MEDICAL BENEFITS TO COOL ROOFS INCLUDING URBAN HEAT ISLAND MEDICATION GLOBAL COOLING BETTER AIR QUALITY AND IMPROVED HUMAN HEALTH AND COMFORT. FINALLY CONSIDERATION OVER THE NEXT TWELVE YEARS FOR TRAINING -- CODE CYCLES OF TITLE. TWENTY FOUR TO RAISING PRODUCT PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR RESIDENTIAL COOL REFRESHER FITS AND EXPANDING THE RANGE OF CLIMATES OWNS TO WHICH THESE REQUIREMENTS APPLY. COULD SUBSTANTIALLY BOOST TO COOL ROOF ENERGY COST SAVINGS ENJOYED BY HOMEOWNERS ATTENDANCE AND HELP CALIFORNIA MEET ITS SB THREE THIRTY GOAL OF DOUBLING ENERGY EFFICIENCY SAVINGS BY. TWENTY THREE THANKS. GENERALLY I MEAN WORLD. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT CORPS OF TECHNOLOGY OTHER THAN PAINTING THE ROOF WHITE OR HAVING A LIGHT COLOR ROOF? AND HAVING THE VENTING WHAT ELSE ARE YOU. IN THIS CASE IS PRIMARILY WE CALL COOL COLOR TECHNOLOGY HALF OF SUNLIGHT IS INVISIBLE SO FOR DECADES. ROUTING PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN SOLD THAT ARE MORE REFLECTIVE THAN YOUR I WOULD. PERCEIVE BECAUSE THEY DO A GOOD JOB OF REFLECTING THE INVISIBLE HALF OF SUNLIGHT. IN FACT AN ORDINARY RED CLAY TILE ROOF JUST AS AN EXAMPLE IS ONE OF THOSE IT REFLECTS ONLY ABOUT 20% OF VISIBLE LIGHT. BUT ABOUT A 40% OF SUNLIGHT BECAUSE IT'S REFLECTING A LOT OF THE INVISIBLE SOME LIGHT THAT STRIKES THE ROOF. AND THAT'S TRUE OF MANY OTHER COLORS. TO SO IT'S READ A IF YOU HAVE A BLACK ROOF I IMAGINE THAT'S PROBABLY THE WORST. AN ORDINARY BLACK ROOF. OKAY ACTUALLY ON THE GOOD SIDE WE GO HERE'S YEAH WE WE HAVE SHOWN. WE WE ACTUALLY CAN THEN BRING OUT THE SAMPLES HERE BUT YOU CAN MAKE A BLACK ROOF THAT REFLECTS IS. THE COLOR DOESN'T AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO REFLECT THE INVISIBLE SUNLIGHT AND OVER HALF OF THE SUNLIGHT IS INVISIBLE THEY'RE ACTUALLY PRODUCTS OUT THERE THAT ARE BLACK AND WOULD MEET THIS REQUIREMENT. NOW OF COURSE NOT PROMOTING THE USE OF BLACK ROOTS BUT HELL HELL COLORS ARE AVAILABLE I'M ASKING BECAUSE SO HOW CAN I MAKE MY LIKE ROOF MORE REFLECTIVE. THE BEST MOVE IS WHEN YOU ARE IT'S TIME TO REPLACE THE ROOF THAT'S WHEN YOU WANT TO CHOOSE A COOL ROOFING PRODUCT BECAUSE THAT WAY THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL LABOR OR MATERIAL EXPENSE. FOR MOST PRODUCTS THE COLOR IN THE REFLECTANCE OF THE ROOFING MATERIAL DON'T AFFECT THE PRICE AND MOST ROOFS ARE PLACED ON HOMES ABOUT EVERY TWENTY YEARS THAT MEANS 5% OF THE ROOFING STOCK IS TURNING OVER EACH YEAR. JUST BECAUSE IT'S REACHED END OF SERVICE LIFE AND THERE'S YOUR OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU -- BE IN TWENTY YEARS I GUESS BUT BUT ANYWAY THANK YOU FOR THE FREE CONSULTATION -- ANYONE IN THE PUBLIC WE ALREADY WENT THROUGH THIS MEMBERS. WHAT WHAT IS THE COST OF THIS OVER -- A CURRENT. THE OUT NON REFLECTIVE ROUGH SURE -- SO IS STUDY WAS SENT AS A MENTION IN -- TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN FOR THE STATE AND WANTED FOUND IS THAT. FOR MATERIALS OTHER THAN ASPHALT SHINGLES FOR EXAMPLE CLAY TILE CONCRETE TILE METAL THERE IS NO COST PREMIUM. SO THE COLOR IN THE REFLECTANCE FOR THOSE TYPES OF BIRDS HAD NO EFFECT ON THE PRICE. AND FOR A ASPHALT SHINGLES WHICH ARE QUITE COMMON THEY FOUND A STRONG OVERLAP BETWEEN THE PRICES OF THE ROOFS THAT ARE REQUIRED BY TODAY'S BUILDING CODES LOWER PERFORMANCE SCHOOL ROOFS. AND HIGHER PERFORMANCE COOL RIFFS OF THE TYPE THAT I'M SPEAKING. SO IN MANY CASES THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE IN PRICE IN SOME CASES THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN PRICE. I WOULD ALSO MENTION THOUGH THAT THERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL ENERGY COST SAVINGS PROVIDED BY GOING TO THE COOL ROOF -- OVER THE LIFETIME OF THE ROOF THE SAVINGS OF A PRESENT VALUE OF ABOUT FIFTY CENTS TO A DOLLAR PER SQUARE FOOT. SO EVEN IF YOU HAD A COST PREMIUM OF THAT NATURE IT WOULD BE PAID BACK BY THE ENERGY SAVINGS. AND I THINK AN IMPORTANT POINT TO MAKE IS THAT COST EFFECTIVENESS ISN'T A COMPONENT OF THE BILL. WE HAVE OPPOSITION LIKE TO SPEAK ON THE BILL HE COULD COME FORWARD [inaudible] HEY HI. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS -- MY NAME IS READ HITCHCOCK I SERVICE EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE ASPHALT ROOFING MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION. ADDITIONALLY I'M HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY REPRESENTING NOT ONLY MY ORGANIZATION BUT A COALITION THAT INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY 90% OF MANUFACTURES A ROOFING MATERIALS. INCLUDING CONCRETE AND CLAY TILE INCLUDING SENIOR SHAKING SHINGLES -- THOSE MATERIALS AVAILABLE FOR LOW RISE RESIDENTIAL STRUCTURES IN CALIFORNIA THE RAW MATERIAL IN EXCESS RE SUPPLIERS INSULATION MANUFACTURERS DISTRIBUTORS AS WELL AS THE CONTRACTOR BASED INSTALLS WHICH MATERIALS. OUR COALITION AS OPPOSED AB -- SIX SIXTY WHICH IS -- IN ITS CURRENT FORM-- TAKES THE SURFACE REFLECTANCE OF THE ROOF FROM 2420% IN THE CURRENT STANDARD 2405%. IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY THIRTY ONE STANDARD BUT ALSO PRESCRIBES EXPANDING THE RANGE OF CLIMATE ZONES WITHIN CALIFORNIA. TO WHICH THESE REQUIREMENTS WOULD APPLY. AS A FRAME OF REFERENCE WATER HAS A SOUL REFLECTANCE ABOUT 10%. FOREST'S RANGE FROM 5220% CROPS FROM 18225% GRASS FROM 2230% AND DESERT FROM 2240% 45%. OUR INDUSTRY IS A NUMBER OF CONCERNS WITH AB SIX SIXTY I'M GONNA FOCUS ON THREE KEY AREAS CONSUMER COST CONSUMER CHOICE AND REGULATORY PROCESS -- ASPHALT ROOFING -- REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY 80% OF RESIDENTIAL ROOFING CALIFORNIA OVER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION SQUARE FEET PER YEAR OF OF ROOTS ARE INSTALLED -- AND IS LOWEST COST OPTION FOR LOW RISE RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS. TODAY THERE ARE READILY AVAILABLE ASPHALT ROOFING PRODUCT OPTIONS THAT ARE CONSIDERED COOL. AND MEET OR EXCEED THE CECE'S CURRENT REFLECTANCE REQUIREMENTS THERE ARE ZERO ASPHALT ROOFING MATERIALS AND ZERO WOULD SHAKE MATERIALS THAT CAN MEET THE THREAT THRESHOLD SET BY THIS PROPOSED LEGISLATION. THE FEW PLAYER CONCRETE TILE AND METAL ROOFING OPTIONS THAT CAN COMPLY ARE VIRTUALLY ALL WHITE% IN COLOR. ZERO ASPHALT SHINGLES MEANS THAT THE NEXT LOWEST COST COMPLY AN A LIGHT COLORED METAL WILL COST THE AVERAGE HOMEOWNER IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT THREE TIMES AS MUCH FOR AN AVERAGE SIZE ROOF GOING FROM ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THE ROOF. TO TWENTY ONE THOUSAND TO REPLACE THE ROOF. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT IN MOST CIRCUMSTANCES A NEW ROOF IS A NECESSITY AND NOT A LUXURY -- THIS BILL WOULDN'T BE SIGNIFICANT CONCERN TO THE WEALTHY BUT COULD BECOME A POTENTIALLY CRIPPLING TO THOSE STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET AND SEEKING YOUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. BEYOND THE COST HOMEOWNERS WERE HAVE EXTREMELY LIMITED AESTHETIC OPTIONS VIRTUALLY ANY COLOR YOU LIKE SO LONG AS IT'S A SHADE OF WHITE. OF THE PRODUCTS CURRENTLY SOLD IN CALIFORNIA WHITE IS THE LEAST POPULAR COLOR AND WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED BY THE MARKET. EVERY MEMBER OF EVERY MANUFACTURER REPRESENTED BY OUR COALITION OFFER SCHOOL ROOFS UNDER THE CURRENT STANDARD BUT WHERE IT MAY MAKE SENSE FOR ONE HOMER BUILDING THAT CERTAINLY DOESN'T MAKE IT THE RIGHT OPTION FOR EVERY HOME WE'RE BUILDING. THERE ARE NUMEROUS MEANS TO SAVE ENERGY IN A HOME. FROM A FISHING APPLIANCES TO EFFICIENT BILL BUILDING MATERIALS LIKE INSULATION WINDOWS DOORS AND CITING. MANY OF THESE ARE FAR MORE COST EFFECTIVE IN TERMS OF INITIAL COST AND RETURN ON INVESTMENT AND WHAT AB TO SIX SIXTY WILL DICTATE [inaudible] FINALLY. THE CDC HAS A STATE GOVERNMENT APPROVED ROBUST CO DEVELOPMENT PROCESS WHICH CONSIDERS NEWLY DEVELOPED AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGIES AND BY LAW UNDER THE WERE IN ALL CHRIS STACKED COST JUSTIFICATION. ARE COMBINED INDUSTRIES OF WORK DIRECTLY WITH THE COMMISSION SINCE TWO THOUSAND THREE WHEN COOL ROOFS FIRST BECAME A TOPIC OF CONSIDERATION. WE HAVE RESPONDED TO THE COMMISSION'S ENERGY EFFICIENCY TARGETS WITH MATERIALS TO PROVIDE VALUABLE LEGITIMATE OPTIONS TO HOMEOWNERS. THE CDC SHOULD EXAMINE THE BENEFITS OF ALL EFFICIENT BUILDING MATERIALS RATHER THAN BEING BEHOLDEN TO AN UNWIELDY BILL THAT LIMITS CONSUMER CHOICE AND IMPOSES SIGNIFICANT COST BURDENS. THE COLLECTIVE ROOFING INDUSTRY ASK THE COMMITTEE TO LET HOMEOWNERS CONTINUE TO USE PROVEN MATERIALS AND BE ABLE TO CHOOSE NOT ONLY THOSE MATERIALS. BUT ALSO THE MEANS FOR MEETING ENERGY REQUIREMENTS IN THEIR HOMES AND TO LET THE CDC CONTINUE TO DO ITS JOB TO IMPLEMENT IN ENERGY CODES. THAT CONSIDER ALL COMPONENTS OF A HOME OR BUILDING TO MEET ENERGY EFFICIENCY STANDARDS AND GOALS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST A NO VOTE THANK YOU. SIR GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS THOMAS PAPPAS I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF WESTERN STATES ROOFING CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION WHOSE CONTRACTOR MEMBERS PROVIDE INSTALLATION REPAIR SERVICES. FOR THE RESIDENTIAL COMMERCIAL. ROOFING CONSUMER ACROSS THE FIFTEEN WESTERN UNITED STATES OUR LOW ORGANIZATIONS LARGEST CONTINGENT CONTRACTOR MEMBERS IS ARE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND I'M HERE T VOICE MY OPPOSITION. TO THE BILL CURRENTLY BEING CONSIDERED AB. SIX SIXTY IN CONCERT WITH MISTER HITCHCOCK'S REMARKS I OFFER THE FOLLOWING THREE POINTS FROM THE CONTRACTORS. SERVICE PROVIDERS PERSPECTIVE. FIRST OF ALL. FOR BETTER OR WORSE CONTRACTORS WILL BE THE INITIAL CONTEST CONTACT WITH THE RIPPING CONSUMER ON THESE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS. AS SUCH IT IS THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO OFFER THEM THE BEST MOST COUGHED COST EFFECTIVE WAY. TO EITHER REPAIR OR REPLACE THE ROOF TO PROVIDE THE CONSUMER WITH QUOTE UNQUOTE LIMITED ALTERNATIVES FOR THEIR DECISION WILL PUT THEM IN A PARTICULARLY UNTENABLE SITUATION. CALIFORNIA RIPPING CONSUMERS HAVE BEEN OFFERED THE BROADEST ARRAY OF ROOFING PRODUCTS KNOWN ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WITH A DIVERSE SET OF CLIMACTIC CONDITIONS AND THAT MAKES OUR STATE SO WONDERFUL TO LIVE IN. AND MARKET MARKET ESTABLISH PRODUCTS PROVIDES MANY ALTERNATIVES AND ENERGY EFFICIENT WAYS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET QUALITY PRODUCTS AT A COST. COST EFFICIENT WAY AND IN THEIR INSTALLATION THE COCKTAIL MARKET FORCES THE DRIVE CALIFORNIA TO BE ONE OF THE TOP STATES IN TERMS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF ROOFING PRODUCTS OFFERED WITHIN OUR STATE. IT WOULD BE IN OUR STATE IN OUR OPINION REDEFINED WHAT IT MEANS TO BE IN THE MELTING POT THAT IS CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA'S OF ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A STATE OF ALTERNATIVES AND CHOICE IN THIS LEGISLATION WOULD SEVERELY LIMIT ITS CITIZENS. TO USE VIABLE AN EXISTING QUALITY RIPPING. A BASE PRODUCTS BASED ON CLIMACTIC AESTHETIC AND ENERGY EFFICIENT DEEDS. TWO LIMITING THE TYPE OF ROOF TO BE INSTALLED BRINGS INTO FOCUS THE NEED FOR MORE SPECIALIZED LABOR TO INSTALL THEM THEREBY INCREASING COSTS TO THE CONSUMER. WITHIN ALREADY CHALLENGE LABOR FORCE HERE IN THE WEST MANDATING ANY TYPE OF STYLE OR ENERGY EFFICIENT OF THE ROOF OTHER THAN ALREADY EXISTING CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS WOULD DO NOTHING TO RELIEVE THIS PROBLEM EFFECTIVE WOULD EXACERBATED TO A LARGE EXTENT. EFFICIENT. ALREADY. RT EXISTING QUALITY COST EFFECTIVE PRODUCTS FOR THE KEY TO RESPONSIVE MARKET DYNAMIC LIMITING THAT DYNAMIC IN ANY FORMALLY TO INCREASING CONSUMER DISSATISFACTION AND HIGHER INITIAL COST ESPECIALLY THE BENEFIT. IT'S NOT A PARENT IN THE SHORT TERM. AND FINALLY CONTRACTORS ARE FOR EVERYTHING ELSE VERY CODE SENSITIVE. AS SUCH. THEY MUST BE AWARE OF THE ENERGY BUILDING SEISMIC ANOTHER REGULATORY FACTORS WHICH THEIR WHICH GOVERN THEIR INSTALLATION REPAIR PROCESS AND HAVE FOR A LONG TIME. DIFFERENT BUILDING CODES AND SEVERAL QUOTE UNQUOTE SOURCES OF TRUTH FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY ETCETERA WILL LEAD TO FIELD CONFUSION DELAYS AND ULTIMATELY COST TO THE CONSUMERS. CONTRACTORS IN CALIFORNIA ARE WELL INFORMED ABOUT BUILDING CODES ENERGY SEISMIC REQUIREMENTS THAT GOVERN THE WORK IN WHICH THAT THEY ARE DOING. ADDITIONALLY THE SYSTEMS BY WHICH CODES ARE MODIFIED OR UPDATED OUR CELL WE SHOULD LONG PERIODS OF INTERACTION BETWEEN THE DESIGNED. PRODUCT AND INSTALLATION COMMUTING TO ADD ANOTHER. ANOTHER SYSTEM INTO THIS ALREADY WELL ESTABLISHED CODE PROCESS BY PROVIDING TO PROVIDE THE BEST IN COST OF COST EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVES WILL PROVIDE NO ADDED BENEFIT TO THE CONSUMER AND TO THE ROOFING COMMITTEE. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IT IS FOR THESE THREE REASONS AND THE CONSISTENT SUPPORT OF THE FREE ENTERPRISE A MARKET. REGULATION SYSTEM THAT WE RESPECTFULLY URGE NO VOTE ON THIS ITEM THANK YOU FOR THAT -- DO WE HAVE. I ASKED -- FOR SUPPORT COMMENTS BUT NOBODY CAME FORWARD I'M GONNA ASK ONE MORE TIME BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO MEMBERS. THIRTY TRAIN NUMBERS NIKITA CROWDED WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL HERE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. OKAY A WILL COME TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS [inaudible] WE WANT. I JUST LIKE TO ASK THE OPPOSITION HERE -- YOU SEEN THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT DO ANYTHING FOR YOU. CHANGER. IT IS NOT CHAIR SUBSTANTIVE ARGUMENT IT DOESN'T. WHY YEAH I THINK THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION WELL OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE THE OF THE PROPOSED AMANDA AMENDMENTS OR THAT IT REVERTS TO AN EARLIER VERSION -- YOU STILL HAVE THE SAME CHALLENGES NOT ONLY WITH CIRCUMVENTING THE REGULATORY PROCESS WITH THE CDC NOT LOOKING AT DIRECTING THEM SPECIFICALLY TO LOOK AT ROOFING INSTEAD OF THE ENTIRE ROOFING SYSTEM WHICH WOULD INCLUDE INSULATION AND OTHER MATERIALS THAT OFFER COST. EFFICIENCY BENEFITS. OTHER TECHNOLOGIES IN THE HOME THAT PEOPLE MAY CHOOSE TO INVEST THEIR MONEY AND TO SAVE ENERGY -- AND IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE AND TARGET OF 45%. WHICH WITH. WHAT WE'RE I WILL RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH MY MY COLLEAGUE TO MY LEFT -- THAT -- MATERIALS WILL BE WHITER SHADE OF WHITE AND THIS COMES FROM THE TILE ROOFING INDUSTRY HAS SAID THAT THEY'RE PART OF OUR COALITION -- THE PILOT PROJECTS WITH THE MANUFACTURERS OF THE GRANULES I THINK SOME OF WHOM ARE HERE IN OPPOSITION TODAY -- IT'S NOT JUST ASPHALT ROOFING -- IT'S ASPHALT IT CEDAR SHAKES AND IT SEVERELY LIMITS THE CHOICE FOR METAL AND CONCRETE TILE AND AND AGAIN I MEAN WE'VE WE'VE SEEN THE PILOT PROJECTS THERE WHITE. OR HINTS OF COLOR ON WHITE AND SO LIMITS THAT AND THE COST AGAIN. FOR THE MATERIAL COST YOU'RE LOOKING AT AS MUCH AS TRIPLE THOSE GRANULES ON A STANDARD SHINGLE. THE COST IS TAKING THE GRANULES CRUSHING THEM UP THEY GO THROUGH A FILTERING PROCESS FOR THESE COOL TECHNOLOGIES THOSE GRANULES ARE INDIVIDUALLY COATED WITH INFRARED PAINTS PIGMENTS. THAT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE PROCESS AND WE'RE LOOKING AT PRODUCTS ACCORDING TO THE MANUFACTURERS OF THE GRANULES THAT COULD TRIPLE THE COST OF THAT MATERIAL ALONE. NOT TO MENTION THE TOOLING COSTS THE THE COST FOR COMPLYING WITH MULTIPLE -- ROOFING MATERIAL DEMANDS FROM OTHER JURISDICTIONS AS WELL. POT I'VE GOT TO SAY THAT -- ARE YOU KNOW FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO APPLY THE AUTHOR FOR YOU KNOW TRYING TO COME UP WITH YELP MORE WAYS OF YOU'RE TRYING TO REDUCE -- YOUR ENERGY USE. I I YOU KNOW I I KNOW THAT WE DID LAST YEAR WE HAVEN'T. THAT ALL NEW HOME TO GET HAVE SOLAR WE GET IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING. YOUR PROBLEM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I JUST WORRY ABOUT ALL THESE NEW RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT ALL IT DOES IS FURTHER EXACERBATES. THE COST OF HOUSING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. A ED -- I THINK THIS IS KIND OF A WORK AROUND TO THE C. E. C. IS ALREADY ESTABLISHED PROCESS WHERE THEY'RE LOOKING AT EVERYTHING HOLISTICALLY. AT THE END OF THE DAY WHILE I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO WORK YOUR TO FIND MORE WAYS TO REDUCE CARBON TO TO INCREASE ENERGY EFFICIENCY -- I'M JUST NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY UNTIL -- YOU KNOW I EITHER HAVE MORE INFORMATION THAT CHANGED MY MIND ABOUT STRAP BUT I I REALLY BELIEVE THE OPPOSITION. TO A BETTER JOB OF PRESENTING -- THEIR CASE TO AT LEAST TODAY IN THIS HEARING. THANK YOU MISTER AND I I WATCH ON TV I'M SORRY WAS IN HERE TO SEE THE PRESENTATION OF PERSON I HAD ONE QUESTION ABOUT I KNOW IT'S SOMEONE AND RELATED TO THE THE FOCUS WHICH IS ON SOLAR REFLECTANCE BUT IN FROM FROM A FIRE RESISTANCE PERSPECTIVE JUST WANTED TO GET. A LITTLE INSIGHT FROM -- YOU ALL DO ANY. ANY PLUSES OR MINUSES OR SORT OF AN NEUTRAL ON ON THAT MATTER IN TERMS OF FIRE CODE COMPLY TO SENSE YEAH I WE DON'T ADDRESS -- FIRE COULD COMPLIANCE I MEAN THAT'S THERE ARE OTHER AREAS OF LOT ADDRESS THAT FOR ROOF MATERIALS ON I'LL REPEAT MYSELF FOR SENATOR DODD COST EFFECTIVENESS IS ALREADY IN THE BILL. SO IT CANNOT INCREASE COSTS WELL IN A SIMILAR TO BE CLEAR IT'S ALSO SHALL CONSIDER RIGHT -- SO IT'S ALL IT'S NOT A MANDATE IT'S A THAT'S RIGHT IT'S IT'S NOT A MANDATE AND IT'S A SHOCK CONSIDER AND IT THAT THE CHANGE HAS TO BE THAT. OF COST EFFECTIVENESS OVER THE LIFE THE ROOF HAS TO BE CONSIDERED AS WELL. IN THE SHOP. RIGHT SOME. SHALL MEET ALL YOUR LOOK LIKE AND EIGHT BUT IT'S REALLY THE CONSIDERATIONS RIGHT SO THE BUT I SEE YEARS THAT THERE'S DISCRETION TO SAY NO FRUSTRATED CC YEP SO AND WE'VE ALREADY HEARD TESTIMONY THE COLORS AS DIVERSE AS RED AND BLACK -- COULD MEET THE STANDARD. OKAY THANKS CAN I SPEAK TO THE TO THE FIRE NO NO SIR. I'M SORRY JUST FOLLOW THIS. DID ANYBODY ELSE WANT TO SPEAK YEAH. WE HAD ALL THIS. TO THE RIGHT KNOW I THINK THE THE IDEA IS GREAT AND AS WE TALKED EARLIER TODAY I DON'T KNOW WITH THE AMENDMENTS SOMEHOW I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL I DO HAVE CONCERNS ESPECIALLY IN. THE AREA THAT I COME FROM IN THE CLIMATE THAT WE LIVE IN -- DOES YOU KNOW I THINK THIS WOULD BE CHALLENGING AND CERTAINLY COLORS OF A CONSIDERATION FOR ROOF XIN. AND I THINK THAT THE SCIENCE MAY NOT BE THERE TO TO DO THAT BUT YOU KNOW I'LL BE HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL BUT IS CERTAINLY WILL. LOOK AT IT IT APPROPRIATIONS AND AND AS IT COMES TO THE FLOOR TO SEE IF. IT GIVES MORE THOUGHT TO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I'M JUST CURIOUS -- SINCE CC ARI ODDS THE THIRTY TO DO THIS AND HASN'T. AND THEY FEEL IT'S NOT COST EFFECTIVE. WHAT TO WHAT CHANGES HERE? YEAH SURE -- THANKS SO THE AT LUNCH ONE LOOK AT IT. SO THE ANSWER IS THAT THE CDC HAD BEEN OPERATING ON THE ASSUMPTIONS OF WORK THAT WE ACTUALLY DID LBNL AND THE BASE THE CODE ON WHAT THE BENEFITS WOULD BE FOR NEW HOMES. WE DID RECENT ANALYSIS FOR ANOTHER PROJECT FUNDED BY THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND THAT'S WE REALIZE THAT THE POTENTIAL FOR ENERGY SAVINGS WERE ABOUT TEN TIMES GREATER THAN HAD BEEN ASSUMED BEFORE. AND THAT CHANGES THE EQUATION. SO THAT'S THE NEWS [inaudible] OKAY. BUT THAT STILL DOESN'T SPEAK TO WHY THE CC HASN'T DONE THEIR JOB AND LOOKING AT THIS PART TO THE YOU MAY CONSIDER THIS NEW INFORMATION THAT'S BEEN DEVELOPED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND IS NOW BEEN BROUGHT TO BE SO THEY WILL BE ENTERTAINING MENTION. THE LABORATORY TO DO THE RESEARCH FOR THEM IN ORDER THE MOVE. FOR YOU COULD SAY THAT I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THEM -- BUT I WILL SAY THAT THE ENERGY COMMISSION DOES OFTEN RELY ON RESEARCH AND IN THIS CASE WAS RESEARCH THAT IT HAD FUNDED FOR ANOTHER PROJECT. IN THIS BROUGHT TO LIGHT THE OPPORTUNITY -- SENATOR RUBIO CLOVER CENTER DR. THANK YOU -- I REALLY HAVE GIVEN IT MUCH THOUGHT TO THIS BILL IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT OUR GOALS ARE AS CALIFORNIANS. BUT I HAVE A LOT OF CONFLICTS AS IT PERTAINS TO YOU KOW PORTANTINO IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF CALIFORNIA. AND I'VE BEEN HEARING SOME OF THE AYE SUPPORTERS AND OPPONENTS AND I THINK ULTIMATELY FOR ME THE BIGGEST CONCERN RIGHT NOW IS THAT. OUR HOUSING CRISIS WHICH IS REALLY A BIG ISSUE AND DIE GETTING PEOPLE. TO NOT ONLY GET HIM OFF THE STREETS ARE HOMELESSNESS PROBLEM BUT YOU KNOW THE AFFORDABILITY ISSUE AND I THINK THAT WE CAN TEACH TO ADD. A MORE REGULATIONS. MORE REQUIREMENTS AND I FEEL LIKE AT THIS POINT I'M NOT SURE I SEE. AND PERHAPS THAT'S MY DEFICIENCY AND I SHOULD HAVE YOU KNOW. I'VE BEEN RESEARCHING BUT I DON'T SEE IT RIGHT NOW I DON'T SEE HOW THIS IS GONNA SOLVE THAT PROBLEM IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW I DID HEAR I DID SPEAK TO SOME OF THE THE INDUSTRY FOLKS AND THEIR SHARE WITH ME -- JUST BE AN ABILITY TO HAVE CHOICE FOR FOR CONSUMERS BEING ABLE. TO DESIGN THEIR HOME IN A PARTICULAR WAY IN OUR PRESCRIBING HOW THEY DO THEIR HOME AND AND SO I'M HAVING A LOT OF CONFLICTS LIKE I REALLY WANT TO SUPPORT IT BUT IN THIS MOMENT I JUST FEEL WE'RE ADDING ONE MORE LAYER. TWO PEOPLE THAT CAN'T AFFORD HOMES ONE MORE LAYER. TO OUR HOUSING CRISIS ONE MORE LAYER. TO TO A PROBLEM WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE AND SO AT THIS POINT I I FEEL LIKE ANYWHERE MORE INFORMATION -- PERHAPS LATER I CAN JUMP ON BOARD IF I CAN. GET MORE RESEARCH MORE INFORMATION MORE CONCRETE DATA AS TO HOW THIS HELPS BUT T THIS POINT I'M HAVING TROUBLE SUPPORTING AND I WANTED EXPRESSED. YEAH THANK YOU SENATOR -- I THINK A LOT OF YOUR CONCERNS CAN BE ADDRESSED ALREADY WE ARE RESTRICTED BY THE MATERIALS WE CAN USE FOR HOMES FOR EXAMPLE I LIVE IN A WILD IN URBAN INTERFACE I CANNOT PUT WHATEVER CITING I WANT ON MY HOME BECAUSE OF WHERE I LIVE -- WE DO THIS AND SO MANY OTHER PLACES IN HOME CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS -- THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- IN SO BUT I THINK PRIMARILY THE THE CONCERN I'VE HEARD NOT JUST FROM YOU BUT FROM OTHERS IS THE COST. ONE HOW TO SOLVE OUR HOUSING PROBLEM AND SO THE COST LONG TERM. PROBABLY BE IT WILL BE LOWER BECAUSE OF THE THE HEATING AND COOLING SAVINGS FOR HOMEOWNERS. AND PEOPLE NEED TO REPLACE THE RIFFS ANYWAY. SO THIS IS CATCHING PEOPLE WHEN THEY REPLACE THE ROOF THAT WILL GIVE THEM A LONGER TERM SAVINGS. AND AGAIN. IN THE BILL ITSELF COST EFFECTIVENESS MUST BE CONCERT THAT CONSIDERED. SO WE WILL NOT BE IN THE BILL DOESN'T MANDATE ANYTHING FIRST OF ALL. AND SECONDLY NOTHING WILL BE MANDATED THAT IS MORE EXPENSIVE -- THROUGH THE BILL AS WELL. AND I DOCTOR LEVINSON HAS SOME COMMENTS ON THIS POINT AS WELL SURE IT'S OKAY WILL WILL WILL. BUDGET ARE YOU ARE YOU. THEY SATISFY YOUR QUESTION WILL. WILL MOVE ON AND IF I COULD JUST -- YOU KNOW. I I REPRESENT AREA WHERE OF TEMPERATURES YOU GET TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DEGREES AND OFTEN TIMES IF -- IF THERE WERE CERTAIN CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS IN THOSE AREAS IN THIS BILL. TARGET CERTAIN AREAS THAT HAVE HIGH -- WORRY IT EXTREME CLIMATES -- SOMETIMES IT COULD BE A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH FOR SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE -- THAT HAVE PROBLEMS WITH ENERGY YOU OR HAVE A AIR CONDITIONER THAT GOES OUT. ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO MINIMIZE HEATING OF THE HOUSES IT COULD BE VERY IMPORTANT IN THOSE AREAS I THINK THIS BILL GETS. TO COMING UP WITH STANDARDS THAT ADDRESS -- GEOGRAPHICAL -- EXTREMES IN OUR STATE AND SO WHAT WE LOOK AT THIS BILL -- NOTHING STOPS THE COMMISSION FROM ALSO CONSIDERING. OTHER PRODUCTS THAT MAY HELP. REDUCE -- THE THE HEAT OF THE HOME. AND WE ALSO PUT IN -- IN INTO THE AMENDMENT. AWESOME CONTROLS AND DEAL WITH -- THE AVAILABILITY OF LABOR THAT WAS AN ARGUMENT BROUGHT UP THE THE THE THE OF THE BILL ADDRESSES THE THE ISSUE OF LABOR RESOURCES AND ALSO. WHETHER PRODUCTS EXIST THAT MEET THE STANDARD ALSO ADDRESSES THAT AND ALSO GETS TO COST SO. WE HAVE TO MOVE IN A DIRECTION TO HELP. REDUCE ENERGY CONSUMPTION ANYTHING WE CAN DO BE VERY HELPFUL. AND FOR THE AREAS THAT I REPRESENT I THINK THE PEOPLE BE BETTER SERVE HAVING PRODUCTS THAT ALREADY HAVE A REFLECTIVE. A GRADIENT AND AT THAT -- WILL HELP THEM. A SAVE ENERGY MANY TIMES CONSUMERS AREN'T AWARE OF THAT. IF WE CAN HELP GUIDE THEM AND MAKING SURE THEY HAVE A PRODUCT THAT ENSURES LOWER COSTS IN THEIR ENERGY BILL. THAT WOULD HELP FOR TWENTY YEARS SO YOU KNOW I JUST PUT MY ROOF MY QUESTION IS IS MY ROOF. ADEQUATE MY HOME HEATS -- BUT WHATEVER I SAVED IN. IN MY ROOF I'M PROBABLY PAIN IN MY ENERGY COSTS. AND I'M GONNA BE PAYING THAT FOR TWENTY YEARS THE LIFE OF THE ROOF UNLESS I REPLACE AND HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT OTHER PROCESS WHICH AGAIN IS GOING TO BE AN ADDITIONAL EXPENSE WHICH I THINK WOULD NOT BE FRIENDLY ON CONSUMERS EITHER. ONCE THEY REALIZE THEY HAVE A LARGE ELECTRIC BILL. SO IF WE COULD ENTERTAIN A MOTION ON THIS BILL IF IT'S A PLEASURE OF THE COMMITTEE WE HAVE A MOTION -- CLERK PLEASE CALL. I'M SORRY WE HAD A WITNESS -- SQUIRM WE ALREADY HAD. A QUICKLY CALL THE ROLL HUESO. HERE WAS SO HERE MARLA. MORE LIKE PRESENT BRADFORD. BEDFORD HERE CHIANG DODD YOUR DIED HERE HERTZBERG HILL.

WE DIDN'T TALK WITH THE STATE OF THE PROP THIRTY NINE FUNDS WHAT WHAT'S LEFT IT. WELL. YOU KNOW THE UNSPOKEN TRUTH AS WE HAVE NO MONEY TO FUND THE SPELL AND SO -- PART OF CONTINUING TO PUSH THAT -- IS CONTINUING TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION TO BRING IT FORWARD HOPEFULLY TO THE GOVERNOR TO SEE SOME PRIORITIES AND HOW WE ACTUALLY -- CREATE A PROGRAM THAT THAT EXTENDS BEYOND THE FUNDS WHICH NO LONGER EXIST OBVIOUSLY. THAT'S A VERY WORTHY ENDEAVOR BECAUSE I MEAN WE HAD IT WITH A LOT OF SUCCESS AND HE WAS A SMART TO LANE CAN SORT OF THINK GOING FORWARD BUT YEAH HOW DO WE FILL THE GAP HERE MEANS SO RARELY DO WE HAVE A PROGRAM THAT.

RUBIO AYE SKINNER STERN STERN ICE DOWN STONE AYE WIENER. SHE WAS LAST. ONE WAS THESE. LOOK AT THE REAL OPEN CRESCENT MEMBERS. NOW WE'LL MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER SIX AB ELEVEN FORTY TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN WELCOME GOOD MORNING. HOW ARE YOU? WELL GOOD. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS SOME FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THE BILL. A TRUE AS WE KNOW TRANSPORTATION CONTINUES TO BE ONE OF THE MAIN SOURCES WHERE WE HAVE BEEN GOING INTHE WRONG DIRECTION. IN TERMS OF EMISSION REDUCTIONS TRANSPORTATION SECTOR NOW ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT 40% OF THE STATE'S TOTAL MISSIONS AND THAT NUMBER IS UNFORTUNATELY GROWING. AND WE'RE NOT IN THE TRAJECTORY OF MEETING OUR TRANSPORTATION GHG EMISSIONS FOR TWO THOUSAND TWENTY IN -- TWO THOUSAND THIRTY FIVE ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT CARB HAD -- IDENTIFIED IN THERE ONE FIFTY REPRESSED BE ONE FIFTY REPORT IS THAT TN SEES -- DON'T GIVE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO TRANSIT AGENCIES FOR THEM TO ACCURATELY USE THEIR SERVICES WITH REGARD TO THEIR PLANNING AND IF THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE PEOPLE PEOPLE ARE TAKING TEA AND SEASON WAY AND IT'S VERY HARD FOR THEM TO FILL IN GAPS OF SERVICE. SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT WORKS TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR NPOS INCLUDE METRICS ABOUT TNC SAYS PART OF THE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANS. THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES A TRANSPORTATION PLANS TO INCLUDE MEASUREMENTS REGARDING BARRIERS UTILIZATION OF PUBLIC TRANSIT INCLUDING TRANSFERRED FREQUENCY PARKING AND FACILITIES FOR BICYCLES AND I GUESS FOR SCOOTERS. TO I'M IN ADDITION AB ELEVEN FORTY TWO DIRECTS THE CPU SEEM TO CONSIDER THE NEES OF NPOS AND OTHER STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES. TO MEET THEIR SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY STRATEGY GOALS WHEN DECIDE WHEN DECIDING ON TNC DATA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. TO BE CLEAR NPOS IN OTHER TRANSPORTATION AND THESE NEED APPROPRIATE DATA IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT THE POLICIES TO REDUCE THE USE OF SINGLE OCCUPANCY VEHICLES INCREASE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION OPPOSITION. AND TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES AS WE HAVE REQUIRED THEM TO DO. THIS UPDATE TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANS AND ADDED DIRECTION TO THE C. P. UC'S RECORDING REGARDING TNC DATA REPORTING WILL IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TRANSPORTATION POLICIES. I WILL HELP CALIFORNIA MEET ITS LONG TERM CLIMATE TRANSPORTATION GOALS. NOW THE OPPOSITION HAS GIVEN US A MEMONS RECENTLY AND WE HAVE YET TO FULLY BE ABLE TO REVIEW THOSE AMENDMENTS BUT WE ARE COMMITTED TO DOING THAT AND TO WORKING WITH THEM AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THE IMPORTANT ISSUES HIGHLIGHTED IN THE SP ONE FIFTY REPORT WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY PROTECTING USER PRIVACY AND NOT IMPOSING OVERLY. ONEROUS REQUIREMENTS ON THE TNC IS WE'VE HAD VERY PRODUCTIVE MEETINGS WITH THEM JUST THIS WEEK TO TALK ABOUT WAYS THAT WE CAN TAILOR THIS TO MAKE SURE IT'S WORKABLE FOR THEM BUT ALSO TO GIVE OUR OUR AGENCIES THE DATA THAT THEY NEED -- WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IS CATHERINE GARCIA ON BEHALF OF YOUR CALL CALIFORNIA AND I THINK DAVE SNYDER MIGHT BE HERE FROM CALIFORNIA BICYCLE HI DAVE FROM CALIFORNIA BICYCLE COALITION. A THANKS SO MUCH IN ADVANCE AND I APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR CONSIDERATION. GOOD MORNING TERRY MEMBERS MY NAME IS KATHERINE GARCIA ON BEHALF OF SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA. WHICH INCLUDES FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS AND SUPPORTERS STATEWIDE WE STRONGLY SUPPORT AB. ELEVEN FORTY TWO THIS BILL WITH THAT REQUIREMENTS TO HELP LOCAL PENNY AGENCIES MEET CALIFORNIA'S LONG TERM TRANSPORTATION AND CLIMATE GOALS. CALIFORNIA IS NOT ON TRACK TO MEET ITS GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION TARGETS FOR PASSENGER VEHICLES. FOR TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY THIRTY FIVE AND RECENT STUDIES SHOW THAT EMISSIONS FROM THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR CONTINUE TO RISE. AB ELEVEN FORTY TWO WILL ADDRESS GAPS IN CALIFORNIA STRATEGIES TO REDUCE TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS. BY REQUIRING REQUIRING REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANS TO MEASURE TRIPS MADE BY T. AND FEES AND COMMUNITY SPECIFIC BARRIERS THAT REDUCE UTILIZATION OF PUBLIC TRANSIT. AB ELEVEN FORTY TWO WILL ALSO REQUIRE THE CPUC TO CONSIDER THE LONG TERM PLANNING NEEDS AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY STRATEGIES. OF NPOS AND OTHER LOCAL AGENCIES IN DETERMINING THE DATA REPORTING TRIP REQUIREMENTS FOR TEA AND FEES. THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR REACHING CALIFORNIA'S LONG TERM TRANSPORTATION IN CLINICAL TH PLEASE VOTE YES ON AB ELEVEN FORTY TWO THANK YOU [inaudible] GOOD MORNING. SENATORS MY NAME IS DAVE SNYDER WITH THE CALIFORNIA BICYCLE COALITION WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR INTRODUCING THIS IF WE ARE GOING TO GET A HANDLE ON GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. WE HAVE TO KEEP OUR EYE ON THE BALL ON TECHNOLOGY AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN BUILDINGS AND STUFF LIKE THAT BUT WE SHOULD FOCUS ON TRANSPORTATION BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE'RE FAILING IN THIS BILL HELPS US DO THAT. A COUPLE OF A KEY POINTS FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE ONE IS THE REQUIREMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT ACTED TRANSPORTATION AND IT IS INCLUDED IN. TRANSPORTATION PLANS ESPECIALLY WITH ACCESS TO TRANSIT IN OUR EXPERIENCE SOME OF THE M. HEROES ALREADY DO THIS BUT SOME DON'T THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IT'S TAKEN CARE OF IN ALL OF THE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANNING. AND THEN THE DATA WITH REGARDS TO TNC IS IS REALLY IMPORTANT WE WE ARE ACTUALLY BULLISH ON TNC IS IN GENERAL WE THINK THAT THE THAT THEORETICALLY. THE IDEA OF PEOPLE USING -- CARS OCCASIONALLY I INSTEAD OF OWNING THEI OWN CAR REDUCE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED BUT WE KNOW IN FACT THAT'S NOT WE CAN DO IN THE FUTURE. TO HELP -- TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT POTENTIAL. A BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE DATA A REGIONAL -- AGENCIES WILL BE ABLE -- TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT POTENTIAL AND AND IMPOSE -- AND AND WORK WITH -- EMPLOYEE REGULATIONS AND WORK WITH THE TNC IS. TO TO TO HELP THEM DO WHAT THEY COULD DO TO REDUCE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED IF THEY HAVE THE DATA SO WE STRONGLY SUPPORT ELEVEN FORTY TWO AND URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF IT AS WELL THANK YOU THIS -- SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT. REMEMBER SECURE CREDIT WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL ALSO HERE IN SUPPORT WE THINK THIS LEVEL OF GRANULAR INFORMATION IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR REGION'S TO BETTER PLAN INVESTMENTS. AND ALSO REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE ARE TRAVELING THANK YOU THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. DO WE HAVE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. WE CAN MAKE SOME ROOM IN FOURTEENTH PLACE. MR TURN MEMBERS COURT IN JENSEN A TECH MATT -- THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR OUR CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS -- WE DO REMAIN IN OPPOSITION SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OF THE DATA PROVISIONS AND THIS BILL WE ARE NOT -- ON THIS BILL AT ALL -- BEFORE THE JUNE THIRD AMENDMENTS WHEN AN BUT WE DO HAVE -- SOME MAJOR CONCERNS WITH THE PROBLEMATIC DATA SHARING PROVISIONS -- THE RIGHT SURE INDUSTRY ENABLES MOBILITY FOR MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WITHIN THESE PLATFORMS DATA -- IS DATA THAT WE UNDERSTAND CAN BE USEFUL FOR PLANNING PURPOSES HOWEVER THE USES OF THAT MUST BE BALANCED WITH SIGNIFICANT RISKS CREATED BY THE SHARING OF GEO LOCATION AND MOVEMENT DATA. OF PASSENGERS AND DRIVERS WITHOUT ADEQUATE PROTECTIONS THE CURRENT LANGUAGE OF THE BILL DOES NOT ADDRESS THESE RISKS GIVEN THE NATURE AND SCOPE OF THE DATA THAT'S REQUIRED TO BE SHARED WITHOUT ANY PRE ESTABLISHED PRIVACY SAFEGUARDS -- FURTHER THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE CPUC TO INTERRUPT IN UNDER CUT A MULTI YEAR RULE MAKING PROCESS RELATED TO TNC DATA SHARING. AND SEVERAL ENTITIES THAT ARE ACTUALLY INCLUDED IN THE LANGUAGE OF THIS BILL CITIES PLANNING AGENCIES RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS ARE PARTIES TO THOSE PROCEEDINGS. THESE ENTITIES HAVE STATED THEIR DEMANDS AND THEIR COMMENTS FILED PURSUANT TO THIS PROCEEDING AND OTHER STATEMENTS FOR DETAILED TRIP DATA. AND A SHOWN THERE FAR REACHING INTENT FOR HOW THEY PLAN TO USE THE DATA INCLUDING TO MONETIZE TNC DATA. THIS BILL STATES THAT THERE IS A PUBLIC INTEREST THAT TNC SHARE DETAILED TRIP DATA WITH VARIOUS STATE AND LOCAL ENTITIES AND AN UNDEFINED OTHER RELEVANT PARTIES FOR A PURPOSE. THAT IS ALSO NOT CLEARLY DEFINED THE BILL DOES NOT SPECIFY WHO THE RECIPIENTS OF THE DATA ARE POTENTIALLY ALLOWING ANYONE TO CLAIM ACCESS TO HIGHLY SENSITIVE INFORMATION INCLUDING DETAILED ORIGIN AND DESTINATION INFORMATION. TIME STAMPS AND MILES TRAVEL THIS AGGREGATED DETAILED TRIP DATA COULD POTENTIALLY BE USED TO ESTABLISH AN INDIVIDUAL'S TRAVEL PATTERNS AND POTENTIALLY WERE FEEL SENSITIVE INFORMATION. LET'S SEE YOU YOU SEE WE DO BELIEVE WILL ISSUE A PROPOSED DECISION ON THE SCOPE OF TNC DATA SHARING SHORTLY. WHICH WERE CONSIDERED INCORPORATED THE PERSPECTIVES OF MANY STAKEHOLDERS AND THIS LEGISLATION SHOULD NOT INTERFERE WITH THAT PROCESS AND THE OLD TO MAKE DECISION -- FINALLY JUST VERY QUICKLY CITIES ARE NOT HELD TO THE SAME STANDARDS AS SECURITY AND PRIVACY STANDARDS WRIST RESPECTIVE WHO DATA CAN BE SHARED WITH AND HOW IT CAN BE USED AND THEREFORE THE BILL. AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN CREATE SIGNIFICANT RISKS TO TNC IS USER PRIVACY AND SECURITY -- CURRENTLY THE BILL STATES THAT RELEVANT DATA SHARING PROTOCOLS WILL BE USED TO PROTECT USER PRIVACY BUT FAILS TO SPECIFY WHAT THOSE PROTOCOLS ARE. HOW THEY WILL PROTECT THE SENSITIVE DATA FROM BEING MISUSED AND HOW THEY WILL BE CONSISTENT WITH OTHER PRIVACY POLICIES THAT THIS LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED? AND TO BE CLEAR TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND SUSTAINABILITY GOALS OF CALIFORNIA OUR GOALS THAT WE SHARE WE'VE WORKED WITH THIS LEGISLATURE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PASSED LEGISLATION TO SUPPORT THOSE GOALS AND FOR THE DATA SHARING THAT -- IS NEEDED FOR THOSE GOALS BUT UNFORTUNATELY GIVEN THE BILLING PRINT TODAY -- AND THERE ARE CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS GOING ON AT THE AUTHOR WE DID -- PROVIDE SOME AMENDMENTS BUT AS CURRENTLY IN PRINT TODAY WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS AND REMAIN OPPOSED. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS LEAH SO WITH OUR WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HELP CHAMBERS MEMBERS UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF WORKING WITH THE PC AND WITH LEGISLATURE ON A SOLUTION THAT HELPS THE PC AND MUNICIPALITIES BILL DATA DRIVEN REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANS. AND OUR MEMBERS ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR OF POTENTIAL AMENDMENTS HOWEVER AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED THE BILL DOES HAVE THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES LAID OUT WHAT MY COLLEAGUE AT TECHNION. IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THE INTENT OF THIS BILL WITHOUT FOR IN THE PRIVACY OF USERS AND WITHOUT INCREASING OPERATIONAL DEMANDS ON THE PC AND INDUSTRY. IT'S CRITICAL TO FIRST IDENTIFY WHICH MUNICIPAL POLICIES THAT BENEFIT FROM TNC DATA AND FROM THERE ASSESS HOW WHAT AND WHEN DATA COULD BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE MUNICIPALITY IS. GIVING SO IN THIS MANNER WOULD ENSURE THAT THE GOALS OF THE MUNICIPALITIES CAN BE MET WILL ALSO MITIGATING THE REST THAT STEM FROM DATA SHARING WITHOUT ADEQUATE SAFEGUARDS. THE YEARS LONG RULE MAKING UNDERTAKEN BY THE PC REPRESENTS THE CHALLENGE OF DETERMINING THIS FOR SINGLE AGENCY. WITHOUT THE SAME FEAR OF CARE THE LEGISLATURE CAN RISK UNDERMINE THE PROCESS AND EXPRESSING THE PC IN THE BELLY OPERATORS TO AN ENDLESS STREAM ON ACCORDING TO DATA REQUEST. THEY CAN POTENTIALLY RESULT IN A SUBSTANTIAL VOLUME A SENSITIVE DATA BEING DISCLOSED BECAUSE THE BILL DOES STILL CONTAIN THESE AMBIGUITIES AROUND THE DEFINITIONS LAID OUT BY MY COLLEAGUE AT TECH NET. AND HOW WILL BE SHARED WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE FILLING THE GAPS IN THIS BILL FOR THESE REASONS AND OTHERS CAL TIMBER CONTINUES TO BE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. WHO UNDER ONE ELSE A POSITION? CLUB CD CALIFORNIA ADVISERS HERE WE HAVE UBER -- WE ALSO REMAIN OPPOSED THE REASONS STATED THANK YOU. NO ONE ELSE [inaudible] MEMBERS. CENTER RUBIO THANK YOU. WELL FIRST FIVE ONE I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I THINK THAT HAVING A REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLAN IS. EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO TOLD OUR GOALS AS THE STATE CITY TO CITY LEADERS AND ALSO STATE LEADERS BUT ONE OF MY CONCERNS AND AND AGAIN I I REALLY DO LIKE THIS BILL BUT YOU KNOW I JUST WANNA MAKE GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS. AS IT PERTAINS TO A SENSITIVE DATA INFORMATION AND HOW IT'S CHAIRED CAN YOU. SPEAK TO THAT PLEASE THANK YOU SENATOR I REALLY APPRECIATE THE QUESTION SO THE BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE THE SHARING OF DATA DOES NOT DICTATE HOW THE DATE IS GONNA BE SURE TO DOESN'T DICTATE WHAT DATA WILL BE SHARED. IT JUST GIVES A LITTLE BIT MORE PARAMETERS SIX TWO C. P. YOU SEE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE NEEDS OF LOCAL AGENCIES. SO THE CPUC CERTAINLY WITHIN THEIR HEARING WILL TAKE ALL OF THESE PRIVACY TO CONCERNS INTO ACCOUNT AND THEN LIMIT THE DATA THAT SHARED THROUGH THEIR PROCESS THE BILL DOESN'T SAY TO SEE IF YOU SEE. YOU MUST REQUIRE UBER TO GIVE RAW DATA TO THE AGENCIES IT DOESN'T SPECIFY THE LEVEL OF SPECIFICITY THAT'S GIVEN IN FACT WE FULLY WOULD WANT A C. P. YOU SEE TO MAKE SURE THAT PRIVACY IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT -- BUT WE ARE TRYING TO TELL THEM THOUGH TO MAKE SURE THAT THE NEEDS OF THE AGENCIES ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN YOU SET THESE RULES. WE HAVE BEEN MONITORING THE ONGOING HEARINGS THAT THEY'VE BEEN HAVING AND THEIR PROCESS AND WE FEEL THAT THEY'RE NOT TAKING THE AGENCIES NEEDS ARE FOR PLANNING INTO ACCOUNT AND NOT. AND WE'RE JUST TELLING THEM TO PRIORITIZE THAT WE'RE CERTAINLY HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD MAKE IT CLEAR THAT WE'RE NOT TRYING TO GET THEM TO TRUMP CALIFORNIA LAW. WHEN IT COMES TO PRIVACY OR TO GIVE ANY DATA THAT SO SENSITIVE THAT WOULD -- BE OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA LAW WE WE ABSOLUTELY RESPECT THE PRIVACY WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE THAT'S BEEN PASSED LAST YEAR AND WE WOULD FULLY EXPECT THE CPUC. TERMINATION SO CERTAINLY THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO A BALANCE AND LET ME ALSO SAY -- GLENDALE FOR INSTANCE OWNS ALL POWER COMPANY THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHEN ALL OF THEIR USERS ARE WATCHING TELEVISION OR RUNNING THEIR POOL PUMP TO THEIR SMART METER PROGRAM CITIES ARE ABSOLUTELY. RIGHT NOW -- HAVE A LOT OF DATA THAT ABOUT THEIR CITIZENS -- AT THEIR FINGERTIPS AND I DO THINK THAT WE NEEDBETTER REGULATIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT CITIES -- CONTROL THAT DATA THAT THEY HAVE THE ABSOLUTE BEST ARMED ANTI -- PIRACY AN ANTI HACKING TECHNOLOGY AT THEIR FINGERTIPS WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT THAT HAPPENS WE SHOULD ALSO HAVE PARAMETERS ON HOW CITIES ARE ABLE TO USE DATA THE SAME WAY THAT WE SHOULD FOR THE TECH INDUSTRY. BUT THAT'S A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION THAT DOESN' THAT EXTEND TO THE POINT THAT WE SHOULD NEVER GIVE THEM DATA OR ALLOW THEM TO COLLECTED OR USED DATA I THINK THEY'RE REALLY TWO DIFFERENT ISSUES THAT ARE GETTING CONFUSED HERE. IF THEY'RE WORRIED THAT CITIES DON'T HAVE ADEQUATE A FIRE WALLS ON THEIR SERVERS THAT'S A CONVERSATION THAT WE HAVE THE ANSWER TO THAT IS NOT TO SAY WILL DON'T GIVE THEM ANY DAY THAT THEY NEED TO RUN THEIR CITIES -- THE SO I I THINK THAT THAT'S BEING A LITTLE BIT COMPLETED BUT I ALSO DON'T WANT CITIES TO HAVE DATA THAT THEY DON'T NEED AND THATTHEY CAN USE TO TRACK THEIR CITIZENS WE'RE NOT TRYING TO REQUIRE THAT AND WE CAN CERTAINLY MAKE THAT CLEAR IN THE BILL. BUT AT THE SAME TIME IF PEOPLE ARE USING TNC IS IF THEY'RE USING UBER TO GET TO A CERTAIN LOCATION CONSISTENTLY CITIES NEED TO KNOW THAT BECAUSE THEY MAY WANT TO RUN A BUS TO THAT LOCATION. OR THEY MAY WANT TO HAVE MORE FREQUENT DREAM SERVICE TO THAT IN PERMITTED THAT LOCATION IF THEY DON'T KNOW WHEN PEOPLE ARE TAKING RIDE SHARING AND WHEN AND WHERE THEY'RE TAKING IT. THEY CANNOT PLAN THEIR OWN TRANSIT SO SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THEIR CONCERNS AND MAKING SURE THAT P. C. P. YOU SEE TAKES THAT. GOAL SERIOUSLY IS WHERE THIS BILL IS YOU KNOW ATTEMPTING TO LAND AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WITH UBER AND WHAT TECH NET TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS AND BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THAT SHOULD STOP. US FROM MAKING SURE THAT OUR PUBLIC AGENCIES GET THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED FROM FROM COMPANIES THAT ARE OPERATING WITHIN THEIR BOUNDARIES. WHAT THANK YOU SO BAD -- THAT WAS NOT AN ISSUE FOR ME BUT HEARING THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION I REALLY. DO APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING IT FORWARD -- YOU KNOW AS YOU MENTIONED WE PASS LOSS LAST YEAR AS A PERTAINS TO PROTECTING SENSITIVE DATA BUT WHAT I'M HEARING IS YOUR OPEN AND WILLING TO WORK WITH THEM TO CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT. THERE'S CLEAR DATA I'M SORRY YOUR LANGUAGE US TO THE PROTECTION OF PEOPLE'S INFORMATION. AND WITHOUT I'M SATISFIED THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR STERN. THEY MISTER. THANK YOU SO MEMBER FIRMING IN THIS FOR NAY PRECIADO THAT'S A HELPFUL EXCHANGE -- I KNOW WE'RE GONNA HEAR THIS IN JUDICIAL Và GETS OUT TODAY SO -- I THINK THE PRIVACY ISSUES RESOLVABLE I THINK THERE'S A WAY TO HANDLE THAT I I DO AGREE THAT. WHAT WHAT IS DETAILED TRIP INFORMATION THAT FEELS OPEN ENDED DOESN'T CONCERN ABOUT OTHER RELEVANT PARTIES LIKE WHO -- SO WANTED BE REFINED. MY I WANT TO TRY TO SOLVE THE SAME PROBLEM THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT HERE WHICH IS ACTUALLY HAD TO DO ACCURATE. TRANSPORTATION PLANNING. AND THE CONCERN IS IF YOU HAVE. I THINK IT'S WHAT 2% OF TRIPS ARE SO IN AT LEAST IN OUR AREA IN THE LA AREA. TWO OR 3% LIKE ARE WE GET A FULL PICTURE. OUT OF THIS BILL. FROM JUST LOOKING AT RIDE SHARING AND I THIS MAY SOUND OVERLY INVASIVE BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE 98% OF THE REST OF THE CARS ARE DOING IN LA. OR THE TRUCKS RIGHT I THINK OF BIG RIGS RUNNING UP THE I FIVE RUNS AND TENDER. YOU KNOW LIKE WHOSE WOULD COMMUTE TIME TO TRY TO DO THIS TRANSPORTATION MODELING WE DO TO FOR A VALLEY TRANSIT PATTERNS SO WITHOUT. THAT FULL DATA SET THEN HOW DOES THIS. WORK I KNOW YOU'RE THINKING FIRST MY LAST MILES OR TO TRANSIT BASED WANTED. ENGAGE ON THAT ONE THANK YOU KNOW IT'S A GREAT QUESTION SO FIRST OF ALL THE DATA IS NOW SHOWING THAT IN MAJOR CITIES TNC IS OUR ACCOUNTING FOR UP 215% OF INTEREST CITY TRIPS. SO IN SOME AREAS IT MIGHT BE 2% BUT IF YOU'RE IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES IT COULD MAYBE EVEN BE HIGHER THAN 15%. SO -- IT'S IMPORTANT THAT CITIES UNDERSTAND THAT AND I I AGREE OF COURSE YOU WANT TO WERE ALL THE CARS ARE GOING BUT TNC USER FOR FILLING A VERY SPECIFIC KIND OF NEAT I THINK. YOU KNOW THERE TEND TO BE GOING AND THAT'S THAT'S WHY IT'S INTERESTING TO KNOW THAT IN SOME PLACES A 50% IN SOME PLACES IT'S SO WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE -- AND IT ARE THEY FOR FILLING THE FIRST MILE LAST MILE FUNCTION ARE THEY FOR FILLINGS -- FUNCTIONS ABOUT CERTAIN TYPES OF SPECIAL EVENTS WERE PARKING IS DIFFICULT. CITIES NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE ARE TAKING THEM AND WHERE AND HOW THEY FIT IN WITH TRANSIT SO YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THERE'S SOME ON ANSWER QUESTIONS HERE BECAUSE THE CITIES DON'T HAVE ALWAYSTHE DATA THAT THEY NEED TO REALLY BE ARE. ABLE TO HAVE THAT FULL PICTURE BUT DO YOU THINK I MEAN ARE YOU OPEN. TO I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF I WANT THIS AMENDMENT FRANKLY BUT BUT WE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT ALL VEHICLE TRIPS. IF IF WE'RE GOING TO GO DOWN THIS ROAD WE SHOULD KNOW WHERE EVERYONE'S DRIVING NOT JUST SHARED VEHICLE. THAT THAT'S THE BIG CONCERN. YEAH. IF TEAM FIRST AS A I WANT TO KNOW WHERE THE 85% OF OTHERS A FOR GOING TO HAVE ACCURATE MODELING FOR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. I THINK THAT A LOT OF THE MORE SOPHISTICATED TNC CERTAINLY KNOW THINGS LIKE THE AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC ON THE HIGHWAY -- THEY HAVE A GENERAL IDEA OF WHERE THEY HAVE MORE CONGESTION WHERE PEOPLE ARE DRIVING MORE TO JOB CENTERS. ARE FOR INSTANCE -- SO I THINK THAT THAT'S YOU KNOW THE DAY THEY DO NEED TO HAVE THAT DATA BUT WITHOUT KNOWING HOW WHICH NUMBERS OF THOSE CARS ARE TNC USE THEIR ALSO MISSING A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THE PICTURE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS JUST IS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. YEAH I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT I KNOW THE METROPOLITAN PLANNING ORGANIZATIONS A NUMBER OF FOR CERTAINLY REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION EIGHT AGENCIES. ALREADY HAVE THIS IN FROM A LOT OF THIS INFORMATION -- BECAUSE OF FAST TRACK AND THEY ALREADY HAVE STANDARDS AROUND THAT PRIVACY STANDARDS. I DON'T THINK THIS IS REALLY ANYTHING NEW. FROM THAT STANDPOINT IT JUST INCREASES THE DATA SETS AND YOU KNOW I I I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT -- THEY CAN YOU CAN PUT THE THAT TRANSPARENCY OR THE PRIVACY. YOU KNOW POLICIES IN HERE TO PROTECT. YEAH SAID TO THE DATA THANK YOU. THANK YOU I JUST WANTED TO COME IF I COULD JUST BRIEFLY I I THINK THERE IS A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN. GET THAT WILL RESOLVE SOME OF THE ISSUES IN TERMS OF PRIVACY AND TO GET TO THAT SWEET SPOT SO HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL WITH FORD. BUT I THINK HOPEFULLY IF IT DOESN'T GET THEIR THEM WE MAY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE AND I THINK JUST. TO THE IT'S AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION THAT WE REALLY GET THE DATA -- BUT THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING BECAUSE I THINK IF IT'S 15% WILL LOOK AT THE 85% AND TRYING. TO TO ACCOMPLISH THE ACCESSING THAT AN UNDERSTANDING THOSE TRAVEL MODELS THAT -- IN DOING THAT THERE'S THEIR PRIVACY CONCERNS ISSUE THIS COULD BE A WAS A PRECEDENT SETTING BUT IT COULD BE A MODEL THAT COULD BE USED FOR OTHER FORMS AS WELL SO I WITH. BICYCLES OR SCOOTERS OR SOMETHING ELSE SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET THERE. YOU KNOW I I RAN A SIMILAR BILL A FEW YEARS BACK BECAUSE THERE WERE -- SOME EXAMPLES OUT THERE IN THE COMMUNITY. THAT SHOWED THAT CERTAIN DURING CERTAIN EVENTS THE WORD JUSTICE -- HUGE GROWTH. LIKE IN ONE OF AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY THEY THEY FLOOD AN AREA WITH VEHICLES. MORE THAN THAT EVENT ACTUALLY NEEDS. AND AND NORMALLY HISTORICALLY CITIES HAVE ALWAYS -- DESIGN THEIR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS AROUND HOW MANY -- FOR HIGHER VEHICLES THERE ARE AROUND HOW MANY TRAINS AND BUSES. AND IN THIS NEW ENVIRONMENT YOU CAN KIND OF FLOOD THE MARKET JUST BY SOMEBODY SIGN UP AND SAYING I'M GONNA WORK THE SUPER FOR ME TO WORK THE THIS SPECIFIC FAIR. AND THERE IS A DELUSION OF AUTOMOBILE USE MANY TIMES THOSE THOSE -- THE USERS OF THOSE ARE MORE OF THOSE THE SERVER PROVIDERS OF THE SERVICES. CAN'T FIND ANY CUSTOMERS BIRTH THROUGHOUT THEIR WORK IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. AND IT CREATES A FLOOD OF OF TRAFFIC. AND OF EMISSIONS AND AND WE GOT WENT OVER YEARS -- ALSO -- TALKING ABOUT HOW -- THE THE INDUSTRY WAS GONNA ELECTRIFY AND CREATE KIND OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. THERE'S IT'S THIS DATA A I THINK COULD BE EASILY DERIVED BY THE THE TRIPS THAT ARE THAT ARE ALL -- REPORTED -- ELECTRONICALLY. ALL THIS INFORMATION IS COMPILED IN A AND IN A THE ALL THE DATA IS AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY BECAUSETHAT'S HOW THEY COMPETENT EMPLOYEES BASED ON THE TRIPS. EVEN PRIOR TO THAT -- OLD TRANSPORTATION COMPANIES WERE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN -- TRIP SHEETS. SO ALL THE ALL THE DATA IS THERE IT'S JUST A MATTER OF NEEDED INTO -- A FORM THAT CAN BE. YOU KNOW WERE PROVIDED. FOR WITH THE HOPE OF PROVIDING THE NUMBER OF TRIPS THAT ARE OUT THERE BEING GENERATED EITHER BY EVENTS. AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT. TO OUR OUR CLIMATE GOALS I THINK THE INDUSTRY'S ARGUED THAT THEY HELP SAVE TRIPS -- THEY'RE SAYING THAT MAYBE BECAUSE THEY HAVE THAT INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THEM IF IT IS THEY SHOULD PROVIDE AND AND MAKE THAT THAT INFORMATION. AVAILABLE TO OUR PUBLIC AGENCIES -- TO MAYBE -- CONFIRM THAT CLAIM. IF IF THEY ARE SAYING IT MUST BE BECAUSE IT MUST BE TRUE. AND IF IT'S TRUE IS BECAUSE BASED ON DATA AND IF THEY HAVE THE DATA PROVIDED. CAN BE PROVIDE I THINK IT'LL BE. IMPORTANT AND IT WOULD. AT LEAST GIVE PEOPLE AN IDEA OF WHAT'S HAPPENING ON OUR STREETS -- ANYONE ELSE -- DID YOU WANNA MAKE ANY CLOSING COMMENTS TO WE HAVE A MOTION. ARE WE HAVE A MOTION. SHOULD THE ROBUST DISCUSSION I THINK YOU ALL -- YOU KNOW CLEARLY APPRECIATE THE GOALS OF THE BILL AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO GET THIS IN THE RIGHT PLACE THANK YOU. CLERK FISCAL ROW. YOU PASSAGE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WEST SO I WAS SO I MORE LOCK BRADFORD. BEDFORD I CHIANG DODD HI DODD AYE HERTZBERG HILL. HILL AYE MCGUIRE RUBIO. RUBIO AYE SKINNER STERN STONE.

WE'LL LOOK AT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AND I'D LIKE TO START OFF BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITMENTS AND THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING. WITH ME ON THIS BILL I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB. THIRTEEN SIXTY TWO WHICH IS IT WOULD -- JAZZ PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED. WOULD REQUIRE THE P. YOU SEE TO OLLECT AND MAKE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ON THEIR WEBSITE INFORMATION ON THE RATES AND PROGRAMS OFFERED BY LOAD SERVING. ENTITIES. AFFORDABILITY RELIABILITY AND D. CARBONIZATION ARE THE CORE PRINCIPLES OF CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY POLICY. DECADES OF LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY ACTIONS HAVE ADJUSTED MARKETS AND ESTABLISH PROGRAMS TO ADVANCE THESE GOALS. AT THE SAME TIME NEW LOW SERVING ENTITIES LIKE COMMUNITY CHOICE ACTAGGREGATORS HAVE GIVEN RATE PAYERS MORE OPTIONS FOR ENERGY DELIVERY. THAN EVER BEFORE. IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THIS ROBUST AND COMPETITIVE MARKET CUSTOMERS NEED FULL ACCESS TO ACCURATE PRICING INFORMATION. AND OTHER PROGRAM OFFERINGS. AB THIRTEEN SIXTY TWO AS PROPOSED TO BE OMITTED. WILL PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION BY REQUIRING THE PC TO POST ON THEIR WEBSITE. ACCURATE AND NON BIASED INFORMATION CONCERNING A LOAD SERVING AND HE'S ELECTRICITY RATES AND ENERGY. PORTFOLIO. THIS WILL ENSURE -- GREATER CONSUMER PROTECTION AND TRANSPARENCY OF ALL LIKE TRICITY RATES AND PRODUCTS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I BELIEVE I HAD I DO HAVE SOME WITNESSES HERE SURE THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT OR SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION IF YOU'D COME FORWARD. STRUCTURE MEMBERS MIKE MONEY GOING TO BE HAVE THE COALITION OF CALIFORNIA UTILITY EMPLOYEES IN SUPPORT. TEN MEMBERS REBEKAH LEE ON THE HAVE A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON WOULD BELIEVE THIS BILL WOULD HELP CUSTOMERS MAKE MORE INFORMED DECISIONS WITH REGARDS TO THEIR SERVICE PROVIDERS THANK YOU. ARE TONIGHT [inaudible] ANYONE OPPOSITION. MEMBERS ANYTHING. WE HAVE THIS REAL QUICK IF I MAY. WELL YOU KNOW I KNOW WE HAD A COUPLE OF INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS IN THE PAST AND I THINK THE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS THAT CAME OUT OF THOSE -- HEARINGS WAS THE NEED FOR A CENTRALIZED PLACE WHERE. PEOPLE CAN GATHER A DATA RIGHT NOW WITH THAT NEW -- EVERYDAY. THEN YOU SYSTEMS COMING OUT LIKE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR RATE PAYERS ABLE TO TO HAVE INFORMATION AT THEIR FINGERTIPS MAKE SURE IT'S ACCURATE UNBIASED. AND SAID SOMETHING THAT I WAS CONSIDERING -- ACTUALLY -- COOPER RAIN SO IF I MAY IN THE FUTURE YOU MAY ASK ME ASK WATER THANK YOU. ABSOLUTELY LOVE THAT YES. VERY WELL WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR BRADFORD. YES WE DO [inaudible] THE CLICK PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. HE PASSES AMEND. THE PASS IS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS WES SO. WHY WAS SO I MORE LACK BRADFORD?

WILL MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER NINE A. B. FIFTEEN EIGHTY FOUR BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK. THANK YOU CHAIR AND SENATORS -- FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE. AND FOR THE THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS OF BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENT ON PAGE SEVEN OF THE ANALYSIS. SO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS. LOAD SERVING ENTITIES -- BY AND LARGE ARE -- GOING TO PAY WELL THE POINT OF THE BILL IS FOR THEM TO PAY THE INDIRECT COSTS. THAT THEIR PORTFOLIOS IMPOSE ON THE ELECTRIC SYSTEMS. OF WHICH IS TO SEND UP TO AND WHAT WE WOULD DO IS SEND A PRICE SIGNAL THAT WILL ENCOURAGE A WELL BALANCED PORTFOLIO TO SERVE CUSTOMER LOAD. LOAD SERVING ENTITIES -- MAY NOT MATCH THEIR ENERGY PURCHASES TO THEIR CUSTOMER LOAD PROFILES. LEAVING THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR WITH RESPONSIBILITY OF ENSURING THAT SUFFICIENT SISTER RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE. THE SERVER LOAD. SO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS IF THE LOAD SERVING AND A D.. I. IS SHORT ON ENERGY AT SOME PARTICULAR DAY OR TIME. THAT THE I. SL WILL GO TO THE MARKET AND IT WILL. CURE WHATEVER ENERGY IS NEEDED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE BLACKOUTS AS WE DID IN. TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND ONE OF BY AND LARGE THAT ENERGY WHICH WILL BE PURCHASED WILL COME -- FROM NATURAL GAS AND IT'LL PROBABLY COME FROM OUT OF STATE. HELLO POTENTIALLY COULD COME FROM THE IN STATE AS WELL. COULD EVEN COME FROM COAL RESOURCES -- BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW ANY BLACKOUTS. THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHEN YOU PURCHASE THIS ENERGY ON THE SPOT MARKET CAN BE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE. AND WHAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IS THAT. THOSE WHO BECAUSE THE SYSTEM. TO HAVE TO PAY FOR VERY EXPENSIVE ENERGY ON THE SPOT MARKET ALSO VERY THE BEAR THE COSTS. RIGHT NOW THOSE COSTS ARE SIMPLY ALLOCATED BASED UPON LOW CHAIR WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ACTUAL ENTITY WHICH DEMANDED THOSE COSTS -- WOULD IN FACT. OF PAY FOR THOSE COSTS SO IT GIVES A CRISIS PRICE SIGNAL TO THE MARKET -- THE ALTERNATIVE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR LOAD SERVING ENERGY HAS. ALTERNATIVES SUCH AS STORAGE ARE OR SOME OTHER SORT OF BACK UP POWER -- BATTERIES -- PUMP HYDRO ET CETERA [inaudible] SO. AB F. FIFTEEN EIGHTY FOUR WITH INSURE THAT LOAD SERVING ENERGIES PAY THEIR SHARE THE INDIRECT COSTS. WITH ME TODAY IS NANCY RAIDER WITH CALIFORNIA WIND ENERGY ASSOCIATION AVAILABLE TO AND ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ARE YOU ACCEPTIG A MEMBER ABSOLUTELY OKAY VERY GOOD AMENDMENT. THANK YOU DID WAS DIDN'T DO YOU WANT TO SPEAK IN FAVOR ANYONE. I JUST -- SPEAKERS IN FAVOR FOR MELISSA CORTES ROTH ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA WIND ENERGY ASSOCIATION WHERE THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. CHAIRMAN THERE'S REBEKAH LEVY ON BEHALF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON WE BELIEVE THIS MEASURE WILL HELP ALL PROVIDERS MAKE MORE BALANCE PROCUREMENT CHOICES TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE OVER HEALTH OVERALL HEALTH OF THE GREAT TO ENSURE RELIABILITY OR SHOULD I VOTE THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING NOW DROWNED ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA BIOMASS ENERGY ALLIANCE IN SUPPORT. YOUR CHAIR MEMBERS MIGHT WANT TO GOING TO BE HALF THE COALITION CALIFORNIA UTILITY EMPLOYEES IN SUPPORT. IT'S NOT HERNANDEZ A BEHALF THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK OR TURN IN SUPPORT. GOT SOME GOOD SUPPORTERS THERE -- ANY OPPOSITION ON THE BILL GOOD MORNING. A MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF MY NAME IS SHANNON EDDIE I'M REPRESENTING THE LARGE SCALE SOLAR ASSOCIATION TODAY. IN OPPOSITION TO FIFTEEN EIGHTY FOUR I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR CONCERNS -- THIS BILL WOULD FORCE THE PC TO IMPLEMENT AN APPROACH THAT CAL WE A HAS PROPOSED MULTIPLE TIMES IN THAT THE PC HAS REJECTED EACH TIME PRETTY MUCH OUT OF HAND. IN THE SIMPLEST TERMS IT WOULD PENALIZE THE ELLIS'S THAT HAVE A LARGER SOLAR IN INTERMITTENCY PORTFOLIO. BY SHIFTING AN EXTRA COST BURDEN TO THEM VIA THE ARE A PROGRAM. THE PREMISE BEHIND THE BILL IS THAT CILLER CREATES INTEGRATION PROBLEMS THAT SHOULD BE REMEDIED BY CHANGING HOW ARE A IS PAID. FOR WHEN IN REALITY WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS IN SO MUCH AS A PROBLEM AS A TRANSITION IN THE MARKET AND THAT DESERVES MUCH MORE THOUGHT THAN ON WHAT A CURSORY. QUICK CHANGE TO THE ARE A PROGRAM WOULD MERIT. WE HAVE FOUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL THAT I WANT TO BREAK DOWN FIRST IT WOULD UNNECESSARILY COMPLICATE BOTH THE I. R. P. AND THE ARE YOU PROGRAM. IT WOULD DISTRACT THE PC STAFF AWAY FROM THEIR PRIORITIES IT WOULD DISINCENTIVE EYES ELLIS SEES FROM FROM OVER PROCURING WIND AND SOLAR. AT A TIME WHEN OVER BUILDING BOTH IS BEGINNING TO EMERGE -- AS A KEY SOLUTION TO DE A TODO CARBONIZED THREAD -- AND IT COULD PENALIZE ELLIS SEES WITH CLEANER PORTFOLIOS -- AND REWARD THOSE WITH MORE GAS IN THEIR PORTFOLIOS. SO THE BILL'S SPONSORS SAY THAT THE PC WOULD LIKELY USE A COST CAUSATION METHODOLOGY DEVELOP BY THE CHI SO HOWEVER COUPLE THINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO NOTE HERE FIRST THE METHODOLOGY WAS CREATED PRIOR TO THE EMERGENCE OF MANY OF THE CCA'S THAT ARE OPERATING TODAY. AND SECOND THE PC IS ALREADY ADDRESSING ARI PROCUREMENT AND THE R. P. PROCESS -- THEY JUST RECENTLY PROPOSED DIRECTING THE LSTS TO PROCURE ARE A VIA THE NEW PROCUREMENT TRACK -- WITH THE I. R. P. JUST GETTING TO ITS FIRST IMPLEMENTATION PHASE IT'S JUST STARTING THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IT'S DONE THIS -- WE BELIEVE IT'S MORE PRUDENT. TO LET THE PC DO ITS WORK UNHINDERED BY SPECIAL INTEREST BILLS -- IN ADDITION THE ARI THE ART RESOURCE ADEQUACY IS A IN UNDERGOING A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE RIGHT NOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS MOVING TO THREE YEAR FORWARD PROCUREMENT AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT CENTRALIZED PROCUREMENT FOR OUR A SO THIS IS GOING TO BE AN ALREADY COMPLICATED ISSUE WHEN YOU'VE GOT SO. MANY CCA'S IN PLAY IN THE MARKET RIGHT NOW. AND THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE PC TO CREATE A NEW FORMULA THAT ANNUALLY ASSESSES EACH. EACH LSE WITHIN A THREE YEAR FORWARD MARKET -- WHICH IS GOING TO COMPLICATE THINGS BEFORE THE PROCESS EVEN GET STARTED. BY ALL APPEARANCES IT SO BY ALL APPEARANCES BASED ON WHAT CAL WE IS -- ARGUMENTS HAVE BEEN IN THE PC HISTORICALLY AND ALSO WHAT THE WHAT THE EXCUSE ME THE THE BILL ANALYSIS POINTS OUT. THIS IT APPEARS OF THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO INCENT PROCUREMENT. OF A SPECIFIC SET OF RESOURCES AND AGAIN THIS IS UNNECESSARY LITTLE ONE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHY. FIRST THE I. R. P. IS ALREADY PROJECTING THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED TEN GIGAWATTS OF OF NEW RENEWABLE ENERGY BY. TWENTY THIRTY THAT'S CONSERVATIVE BYA LOT OF ESTIMATES INCLUDING THE IPCC. AS WE WORK -- TO AS WERE TO THE CARBON EYES WERE WE'RE SEEING A NEW ERA WHERE THE GREAT IS GONNA LOOK VERY DIFFERENT THAN IT LOOKS TODAY. AND WE'RE GONNA BE A LOT MORE POWER ON THE GRID. THERE ARE MULTIPLE MODELING EFFORTS UNDERWAY RIGHT NOW AND I WANT TO POINT TO ONE THAT JUST CAME OUT THAT THAT GIVES US A GOOD SNAPSHOT. CALPINE RECENTLY COMMISSIONED -- E. THREE TO DO AN ANALYSIS OF LONG RUN ARE A AND WHAT WE NEED UNDER A LONG -- UNDER THAT LONG TERM TO CARBONIZATION PATHWAY. NOW THE ANALYSIS ITSELF WAS DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY THE ROLE OF GAS GENERATION BUT WHAT IT REALLY DID WAS REMIND US OF JUST HOW DIFFERENT OUR GREAT IS GONNA LOOK IN TWENTY FIFTY AND HOW MUCH RENEWABLE ENERGY WE'RE GONNA NEED BY THEN. IT ESTIMATES THAT CALIFORNIA ONLY TO MAX OUT. IN AN AND THIS IS JUST SO IMPORTANT IT'S GOING TO MAX OUT ALL AVAILABLE RESOURCES ALL AVAILABLE RECENT RENEWABLE RESOURCES IN CALIFORNIA. NON SOLAR IT'LL MAX OUT ALL THE IN STATE WHEN IT'S GOING TO MAX OUT AT A STATE WIND ALL GEOTHERMAL ALL BIOMASS. EVERYTHING WE CAN FIND. EVEN ON TOP OF THAT IT ESTIMATES WERE GONNA NEED FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF SOLAR BY. TWENTY FORTY EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF SOLAR BY TWENTY FIFTY CONSERVATIVELY. AND AGAIN SOLAR IS UNIQUE BECAUSE IT CAN BE CITED VIRTUALLY ANYWHERE TO PRODUCE POWER AND SO IT'S ANTICIPATED TO FILL IN. AFTER WE BASICALLY OPTIMIZED EVERYTHING WE HAVE. THE TRUTH IS WE DON'T NEED ENHANCED ARE A RULES. TO INCENT PROCUREMENT OR OTHERWISE CONVINCE THE LSE'S TO PROCURE IN A CERTAIN WAY PRETTY SOON CALIFORNIA'S GONNA BE BUYING ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING WE HAVE IT'S GOING TO NEED. TO THE OTHER THING THAT WE'RE LEARNING IS THAT -- SOLAR AND WIND. WE'RE WE'RE LEARNING MORE ABOUT SOLAR AND WIND OVER BUILDING CURTAILMENT. THERE ARE SOME NEW STUDIES ABOUT THIS AS WELL -- THERE ARE MAJOR COST BENEFITS THAT ARE MERGING TO THE OVERBILLED OF BOTH SOLAR AND WIND SO PATH TOWARDS THE CARBONIZATION. AND IT'S FULLY UNDERSTANDING THAT YES CURTAILMENT WILL GROW BUT THE CURTAILMENT IS A TOOL IT'S NOT A PROBLEM. AND IT'S THANKS IN PART TO HELLO ACOSTA RESOURCES ARE EVEN THE CAL PLAN REPORT SHOWS THAT WE COULD SEE TEN TO TWENTY OR ECONOMICAL FROM THE REPAIR PERSPECTIVE. SO I TALK ABOUT THE STUDIES AS A WAY TO HELP US ALL UNDERSTAND THAT THAT WE'RE ONLY JUST NOW BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT A FULLY DE CARBONIZED GREAT IT'S GOING TO BE LOOKING LIKE WE JUST DON'T KNOW XACTLY WHAT THE WHAT THE KEY PIECES ARE. WE'RE BOTH WITNESSED AND PARTICIPANTS IN A VERY FLUID OF MARKET EVOLUTION. SO WE NEED TO KEEP OUR EYE ON THE BALL BECAUSE THERE'S A THERE'S A LOT HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. RATHER THAN DEVOTING THE LIMITED STATE STAFFING RESOURCES TO CREATING BOUTIQUE ARE A FORMULAS FOR DIFFERENT HELICES BASED ON AN OLD GRAD MODEL. LET'S INSTEAD WITH THE PC FOCUS ON THE TASK AT HAND. WILDFIRE LIABILITY UTILITY SAFETY PROTOCOLS UTILITY SOLVENCY AND LOW SHIFTING MECHANICS. ONCE WE GET A HANDLE ON THAT WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO IS START PROCURING AS MUCH RENEWABLE ENERGY AS POSSIBLE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. THE WELL INTENDED WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A WELL INTENDED BILL IT DOES NOT HELP WITH ANY OF OUR PRESENT OR FUTURE CHALLENGES WE BELIEVE WE BELIEVE IT'S GOING TO DISTRACT IF YOU SEE STAFF DISRUPT THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS AND WE RESPECTFULLY URGE YOU TO OPPOSE THE BILL [inaudible] THANKS. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TONY HUNTER ON BEHALF OF THE SOLAR ENERGY INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION OR ASSOCIATE MY COMMENTS WITH THOSE OF SAN ANDY AT LSA. AND FURTHER ITERATE AGAIN THE BILL IS NOT NECESSARY WE SEE THIS INSTRUCTION WE ASK FOR NO VOTE [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] OUR MEMBERS. DID YOU WANNA RESPOND TO SURE. ARM FIRST OF ALL THIS IS A MARKET SOLUTION SO ONCE IT'S IN PLACE IT REQUIRES -- NO ATTENTION BY THE P. YOU SEE. THE BILL IS TECH NEUTRAL EFFECT IF. LOAD SERVING AND HE WANTS TO HAVE LOTS AND LOTS OF SOLAR AND STORAGE. AND THAT WORKS THAT'S JUST FINE THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE THAT TALKS ABOUT TECHNOLOGY -- I WILL POINT OUT THAT THE NEWEST -- PLAYERS IN THIS AREA THE CAL CCA'S THAT THEIR ASSOCIATIONS NEUTRAL ON THE BELL. ARE THEN I'M GOING TO DISAGREE RESPECTFULLY WITH THE OPPOSITION IN THEIR STATEMENT. THAT -- THE CPUC HAS REJECTED OUR THIS APPROACH. OUR FIRST OF ALL. THE BILL WOULD ONLY DIRECT THE SHIP CPUS SHE'D ALLOCATE ANY ANY. INTEGRATION RESOURCE OBLIGATIONS THAT THEY ESTABLISH OUR SUCH AS FLEXIBLE RESOURCE. ADEQUACY -- WAIT A SECOND THIS IS THE WRONG SECTION. WELL THE POINT IS THAT THE CPUC HAS NEVER REJECTED THIS APPROACH AND IN FACT THEY'VE SAID THAT IT'S A PREFERRED APPROACH. ARE THEY JUST HAVE NOT -- DECIDED TO NOT TAKE THIS APPROACH YET. WE'RE GOING TO ASK HIM TO MAKE THAT A PRIORITY SO WE WILL GET THE APPROPRIATE. MODELS HE'S ME THE APPROPRIATE MARKET SIGNAL WHICH WILL BE A VERY EFFICIENT WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE BALLOTS PORTFOLIOS AGAIN THAT COULD BE DONE. EASILY WITH OVER BUILDING SOLAR AND HAVING STORAGE WHATEVER APPROACH WILL BE JUST FINE. VERY WELL A MEMBERS [inaudible] CENTER STERN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU SIMILAR FOR ENGAGING ON THE ISSUE I KNOW WE'VE BEEN. CONCERNED ABOUT THE DUCK CURVE FOR MANY YEARS AND THE IMPACT IT'S HAD. BUT I JUST. I READ THESE RECENT REPORTS SOME OF THE ONES YOU CITED IN. I'M STRUGGLING WITH THE WHOLE PREMISE OF OVER BUILDING BEING A PROBLEM BECAUSE IT'S NOT. RIGHT AND SO THE QUESTION FOR YOU IS HOW. IF CURTAILMENT ENDS UP BEING A COST EFFECTIVE SOLUTION FOR THE FUTURE OF THE GRID. AND WHAT I I WAS JUST READING CLEAN POWER RESEARCH I THINK AT A RECENT STUDY. AND THERE WERE A FEW OTHERS MENTIONED I THINK YOU. THREE BUT TO SAY THAT. IT'S ACTUALLY CHEAPER TO OVER GENERATE SOLAR -- AT PEAK HOURS AND AND CURTAIL WHEN NEEDED VERSES -- UNDER BUILDING AND THEN TRYING TO MEET THAT WITH OTHER BIG INFRASTRUCTURE -- OR FIND I NEED TO GET YOUR TAKE ON AS RHEINISCHE COMPLETE AGREEMENT THAT. IF OVER BUILDING IS THE RIGHT WAY TO GO. AS LONG AS YOU HAVE RESOURCES OF TIME WHEN THE SUN IS NOT UP. I'M FINE WITH THAT YOU CAN YOU CAN BUILD. AS MUCH SOLAR AS YOU WANT. YOU JUST HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SERVE THE LOAD WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN AND MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T GO TO THE I. SL WHICH THEN WOULD. WOULD LIKELY PURCHASE NATURAL GAS BACK UP. PROBABLY FROM OUT OF STATE PERHAPS EVEN CALL AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO PREVENT. AND SO FUNCTIONAL BECAUSE THIS IS A SHALL WRITE THIS THIS DOESN'T GIVE THEM ANY DISCRETION. TO ADOPT THIS FRAMEWORK THIS IS A SO IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY BUT IT SAYS IS THAT THEY SHOULD ADOPT THE METHODOLOGY WE DON'T SAY EXACTLY WHAT THAT IS OTHER THAN THAT HE'S TRIBUNE YET. ACCORDING -- TO PEOPLE'S DEMANDS FOR THAT POWER SAID THAT THOSE WHO PAY. TO GO ON TO THE SPOT MARKET GET THOSE HIGHER PRICES POTENTIALLY EVEN FROM COAL THAT THOSE PEOPLE PAY THE PRICE. SO WHATEVER LOAD SERVING ENERGY THAT IS THIS IS A MARKET SIGNAL. BUT BY THE WAY IT SHOULD BE A SMALL FRACTION OF THE TOTAL ENERGY. SHARE A MY EXPERT NAY LIKE AT A POINT JUST ON THE POINT OF CURTAILMENT THIS DOESN'T THIS DOESN'T ADDRESS -- ANY IT DOESN'T SAY YOU CANNOT CURTAIL WHEN ITIS ECONOMIC TO CURTAIL WHAT IT SAYS IS IF THE P. YOU SEE IN THE R. P. PROCESS. DETERMINES THAT IT IS OVERALL ECONOMIC TO SAY BUILD A PUMP STORAGE FACILITY TO COLLECT THAT LOST ENERGY BECAUSE NOW WE'RE-LOSING SO MUCH THAT IT IS WORTH WHILE. TO TO BUILD A PUMP STORAGE FACILITY. THAT THAT FACILITY BE PAID -- FOR BY EIGHT LSE IS ON THE BASIS OF THAT THEY ARE USING IT SO IF YOU'RE IF YOU IF YOU HAVE A VERY IN BALANCED PORTFOLIO THAT IS CAUSED A NEED FOR THAT. STORAGE YOU PAY MORE THAN SOMEBODY FOR EXAMPLE PENINSULA CLEAN ENERGY HAS A GOAL OF MATCHING THEIR RESOURCES THEIR SUPPLY IN THEIR DEMAND THEY HAVE AS PART OF THEIR RB GOALS. A GOAL OF MATCHING SUPPLY AND DEMAND YOU WILL PAY A LOT LESS FOR THAT PURPOSE STORAGE SO IT ENCOURAGES ELLIS CEASE. TO TO CREATE BELLS PORTFOLIOS THAT MATCH THEIR LOADS. LET ME JUST SAY HOMES THAT WERE ENCOURAGE BALANCING PORTFOLIOS THIS IS NEUTRAL. SHE GAVE A PARTICULAR EXAMPLE -- IF THERE WERE ACCESS. STORAGE THE POINT IS YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO THE SPOT MARKET YOU WANT TO HAVE LONG TERM CONTRACTS. WHICH ALLOW YOU WHEN. YOUR PARTICULAR RENEWABLES ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO GO. THAT ALLOW YOU TO GO TO ALTERNATIVE. I DON'T KNOW OR CARE WHAT THAT ALTERNATIVE IS BUT I THINK THAT SHOULD BE UNDER LONG TERM CONTRACT THOUGH THEY'LL BE OCCASIONS NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU PROBABLY HAVE TO GO TO THE STEP SPOT MARKET. THE POINTED THIS BILL IS TO AVOID THOSE CHARGES WHICH CURRENTLY ARE JUST DISTRIBUTED ON THE BASIS OF LOAD WE WANT TO HAVE THEM DISTRIBUTED ON THE BASIS. OF OUR WHOEVER USE THE RESOURCE. AND SO IT FOR FOR THE OPPONENTS. YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT YOUR LOCKING IN. ONE VIEW OF THE GREAT BUT THEY'RE ARGUING THIS ACTUALLY STILL ALLOWS. FOR FLEXIBILITY SO. IS IS THE CONCERN ABOUT -- AILING CURTAILMENT OR IS THAT WHAT WERE THAT SORT OF FUTURE OF OF A COST EFFECTIVE OVER JANUARY'S IT'S IS IT SOME OTHER ISSUE THAT SORT OF DRIVING THE THE CONCERN ABOUT THIS FRAMEWORK. DID I GET THAT DID I GET THAT WRONG I MEAN IT IT'S YEAH NO I I MEAN. PART OF PART OF WHAT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND IS A PRETTY COMPLICATED ISSUE AND AND BY AT AN END AGAIN. KELLY HAS PROPOSED DOING THIS AT THE PC MULTIPLE TIMES THE PC HAS DECIDED IT'S NOT IN THE INTEREST OF THE PARTIES TO DO THIS. I MEAN IF WE STEP BACK AND LOOK AT THE FACT THAT THEY ARE A PROGRAM RIGHT NOW IS BEING IS BEING FAIRLY OVERHAULED THEY'RE pAPPROACH AND IT AND I THINK THERE'S A THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT. WHAT WHAT IS THAT? IN YOUR MIND BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S SO MUCH FLUIDITY THAT'S HAPPENING IN THE MARKET RIGHT NOW THAT THESE KINDS OF THINGS ARE GOING TO BE RESOLVED ON THEIR OWN. THIS IS A REALLY COMPLICATED I MEAN AGAIN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FACT WE GOT FORTY ELLIS SEES THAT ARE IN THE MARKET WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE ASK THE P. YOU SEE FORCED THE PC. TO BREAK DOWN EACH LSE'S. BASICALLY EACH LSE'S ANNUAL LOAD AND PORTFOLIO. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS WITHIN A THREE YEAR FORWARD FORWARD ARE A MARKET I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY'RE GOING T DO THAT I DON'T KNOW IF THE PC KNOWS HOW THEY'RE GOING TO DO THAT. WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THE PC HAS THIS AUTHORITY ALREADY THEY WOULD HAVE USED IT IF THEY THOUGHT THEY WANTED? TO AND THEY'RE ALREADY DIRECTING THE PARTIES RIGHT NOW AT LEAST BASED ON THE PROPOSED -- RULING THAT CAME OUT A COUPLE WEEKS AGO. THERE DIRECTING THE ELLIS USED TO PROCURE ARE A RESOURCES RIGHT NOW. AND SO THE PC'S ALREADY HANDLING THIS IT'S ALREADY ADDRESSING THIS. I'D RATHER NOT HAMSTRING THE P. YOU SEE WITH A SPECIFIC METHODOLOGY WRECKED OF TO DO A METHODOLOGY -- RIGHT WHEN IT'S BEGINNING TO GET SOME ESCAPE% VELOCITY ON THE IRP PROCESS AND THE ARE A PROCESS AND ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE LEARNING SO MUCH ABOUT THE GREAT CAPABILITIES OF SOLAR AND WIND AND STORAGE AND EVERYTHING ELSE. IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT JUST TO MAKE SURE I KNOW WHAT I'M VOTING ON HERE THAT. IT'S IT'S SHALL DEVELOP SO THE IT WOULD THEY STILL HAVE THE DISCRETION TO NOT USE AYE I GET THE STAFF TIME CONCERN BUT CAN THEY STILL SAY NO TO THIS METHODOLOGY. IN IN YOUR MIND IS THAT THE INTENT TO MAKE THIS A DISORDER. A DISCRETIONARY METHODOLOGY COULD USE OR IS IT OR IS IT YOU WANT TO SEE IT LOOKS THIS WAY GOING FORWARD THAT SAID IS THAT WHAT'S GOING TO BE THIS BILL PROPOSES A PRINCIPLE. TO BE USED IN DEVELOPING A METHODOLOGY SO IT DOES NOT. PRESCRIBE A PARTICULAR METHODOLOGY IT SAYS. THE METHODOLOGY THAT YOU CHOOSE HAS TO BILL PEOPLE BASED ON HOW MUCH OF THE INTEGRATION RESOURCE THEY ARE USING IT HAS TO BE CAUSATION BASED. ALLOCATIONS WERE NOT GONNA SPREAD OUT BY LOW CHAIR WE'RE GONNA SPREAD IT BY HOW MUCH YOU ARE USING. THE SYSTEM INTEGRATION RESOURCES THAT. THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SO IT'S REALLY A VERY SIMPLE THING IS REALLY NOT A COMPLICATED THING. RIGHT NOW -- WIND BIOMASS GEOTHERMAL WE DON'T WE DON'T WE DON'T GET ME CREDIT THAT WE'RE NOT CAUSING THE DUCK NECK PROBLEM -- THIS BILL WOULD FRANKLY GIVE US YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD BY REQUIRING. THOSE WHO ARE PURCHASING SOLAR ALSO TO PAY FOR DUCK NECK COSTS UNDER STAND. I GUESS THOUGH THAT WAS MY POINT TO YOUR INTENT IS FOR THIS TO BE ADOPTED AND UTILIZED YOU YOU WANT THAT IS. THE PRINCIPAL BUT IT'S NOT A PARTICULAR METHODOLOGY NEVER AYE SO DOES HAVE A PARTICULAR METHODOLOGY THAT IT NOW USES. TO ALLOCATE OF FLEXIBLE RAMPING COSTS AMONG LOCAL REGULATORY AUTHORITIES SO BETWEEN THE P. YOU SEE AND A PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES THIS WILL JUST TAKE THIS DOWN TO THE ELLIS THE LEVELS IT'S ALREADY BEING DONE I JUST WANTED TO ASK ASSEMBLYMEMBER. I MEAN ARE YOU OPEN AT ALL AND I DON'T. I'D BE MORE COMFORTABLE WITH THE WITH THE SHALL CONSIDER KIND OF FRAMEWORK AS OPPOSED -- TO USE A METHODOLOGY BUT I THAT WOULD TAKE. A PRECEDING THAT WOULD IN FACT. OUR DISTRACT THE P. YOU SEE FROM WHAT IT HAS TO DO WITH THE POINT HERE IS INSTEAD OF DOING A TWO OR THREE OR FOUR YEAR PROCEEDING TO DETERMINE. WHETHER OR NOT YOU WOULD USE THIS METHODOLOGY -- WE WOULD CALLUM USES METHODOLOGY NOW THEY ALREADY WILL HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION THEY NEED BECAUSE THE I SO TELLS THEM EXACTLY. WHAT COSTS WERE INCURRED BY BOTH AND IT BY AT ALL THE ENTITIES? THE OTHER THING IS IT MAY BE THAT WIND OR FEW THERMAL OR WHATEVER LIKES THIS BILL. I DON'T REALLY CARE WHETHER THEY LIKE IT OR NOT NICE TO BE MY SPONSOR BUT I DON'T CARE. ABOUT WHAT I CARE ABOUT IS THAT BECAUSE THE MARKET SIGNALS WORK AND THAT WE MAKE THE P. UC'S WORK EASIER WHICH IS WHAT THIS WOULD DO. THEY WON'T HAVE TO DO A LONG PROCEEDING LET ME ALSO READ FOR A QUOTE FROM THIS -- THE P. UC -- HAS REJECTED PARTY'S ARGUMENTS THAT THE COPY SO CAUSATION METHODOLOGY IS COUNTER TO CALIFORNIA'S GOLD RENEWABLES. THE P. YOU SEE HAS STATED WE BELIEVE THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE IN PARTICULAR WE NOTE. THAT SEVERAL OF THE BENEFITS DESCRIBED BY THE LEGISLATURE AS JUSTIFICATION FOR THE R. P. AS PROGRAM. OUR BEST SUPPORTED BY INCENTIVES TO MINIMIZE RENEWABLE INTEGRATION COSTS SUCH AS ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY. pSAYING IS DON'T GO TO THE SPOT MARKET UNLESS YOU HAVE TO WHICH WILL HAPPEN FROM TIME TO TIME. BUT MINIMIZE THE NUMBER OF TIMES YOU HAVE TO GO BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE LONG TERM CONTRACTS WHICH IS SURE THAT RELIABILITY. YOU'RE GOING TO BE MUCH BETTER OFF COST TWICE AND AGAIN I AM COMPLETELY TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL. THANK YOU FOR THE INTELLIGENCE BUDGET A RESPONSE THERE IT JUST YOU DO NOT WANT TO SEE THIS KIND OF METHODOLOGY ADOPT ISN'T WHAT WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE THAT YOU ALL WANT TO SEE IN AN LSA OR THAT FUTURE. YOU LIKE WHAT YOU LIKE BUSINESS AS USUAL RIGHT NOW IS THAT IS THAT THE POOR I MEAN THAT THE CURRENT ALLOCATION FORM THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THAT SEEM MORE EQUITABLE OR JUST A QUICK RESPONSE AND THEN ALL. OF BACK BACK OUT HERE THANK YOU. I THINK BUSINESS AS USUAL IS IN FLUX RIGHT NOW BEEN RIGHT NOW BUSINESS AS USUAL IS CHANGING AND SO WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE NEW ARE RE RULES ARE GOING TO BE WE DON'T KNOW. WHAT THE WHAT THE RESPONSE FROM THE PARTIES WILL BE FROM THE P. UC'S LATEST DIRECTIVE THAT AGAIN WAS JUST TWO WEEKS AGO TO DIRECT THE LSE'S TO GO PROCURE ARE A -- IN OUR SINCE THIS IS. THIS IS BOTH PREMATURE AND ITS PREJUDICES AGAINST SOLAR AND NANCY WAS TALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT AND THAT IT IT GIVES A LEGUP TO WIND BIOMASS GEOTHERMAL. MY POINT IS BASED ON THE NEED TO DE CARBONIZED ARE GRADED IN THE TIME PERIOD WE HAVE WHAT WE NEED TO BUY ALL THE GEOTHERMAL ALL THE WIND ALL THE BIO MASS THAT WE CAN GET OUR HANDS ON AND WE WILL. IN ADDITION TO THAT WE'RE GOING TO BUY A WHOLE BUNCH OF SOLAR. SO WE NEED TO MOVE OUT OF OUR PAST RUBRIC OF OF SCARCITY THINKING AND SEILING OUR PROCUREMENT UNDERSTAND THAT WE GOT A BY ALL OF IT WE'RE GONNA MEET OUR CLIMATE TOWARD ITS AND WE NEED NOT PREJUDICED AGAINST ANYTHING. WE NEED TO START WORKING TOGETHER. AND I WOULD ACTUALLY AGREE THAT. THAT'S THE CASE AND THAT THIS BILL HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT IT'S SIMPLY GIVING A MARKET SIGNAL. AND I'M HAPPY A FEW. THE TO HAVE ALL THE SO IF YOU COULD CURE ALL THE SOLO YOU WANT CENTER BRADFORD. THANK YOU I WANTED THINK -- SOON IN COURT FOR A COMMONSENSE MEASURE HERE. THIS IS COMPLICATED AND CONVOLUTED BECAUSE WE'VE HAD LEGISLATORS FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. RIGHT ENERGY POLICY AND THEY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT ENERGY AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE DEALING WITH THIS HODGE PODGE OF WHAT WE CALL. ENERGY RELIABILITY THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE FOR THE P. YOU SEE IS NOT PRICE IS NOT NOT TECHNOLOGY ITS RELIABILITY AND THIS IS WHAT THIS BILL IS IT'S A RELIABILITY ISSUE WE WERE ANY ENERGY CRISIS IN. TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND ONE BECAUSE OF THE SPOT MARKET BECAUSE OF NOT HAVING -- ADEQUATE RESOURCE IN HAND TO BUY IT ON THE SPOT MARKET WE WILL NEVER EXIST AS A STATE WILL NEVER BE THEN -- Là A FOURTH LEADING ECONOMY IN THE WORLD IF WE THINK WE SAIL MORE SOLAR. WE PAY I SHOULD SAY. A LITTLE NEVADA THE TAKE MORE SOLAR THEN WE USE IN CALIFORNIA ON A DAILY BASIS AND WE CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT BUILDING MORE SOLAR BUT DOCTOR QUIRK WILL KNOW THERE'S NOT A SINGLE SOLAR ELECTRON CAN MOVE. WITHOUT TRADITIONAL GENERATION YOU NEED TURBINE YOU NEED TO NURTURE SO TO CONTINUE TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO DO AWAY WITH BASS LOW POWER. WILL THEN WE WILL BE. IN A WORLD OF TROUBLE I AS FAR SYSTEM RELIABILITY THIS IS THE SYSTEM RELIABILITY BUT BILL IT'S COMMON SENSE IF WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE LIGHTS STAY ON AND SO I MOVED THE MEASURE. VERY WELL WE HAVE A MOTION -- CLERK A DID YOU WANNA MAKE ANY CLOSING COMMENTS -- JUST TO SAY THIS IS TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL. IF PEOPLE WANT TO BUY A LOT OF SOLAR AND LOT OF STORAGE THAT'S JUST FINE WITH ME. IT'S MERELY SENDING A PRICE SIGNAL IF YOU HAVE TO GO ON TO THE SPOT MARKET. HOWEVER YOU'LL AVOID GOING ON TO THE SPOT MARKET IS JUST FINE FOR ME THANK YOU THANK YOU. CLICK THIS CALL THE ROLL. THE PASS IS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS WESO I WAS SO I MORE LOCK BRADFORD.
