TWENTY SIX THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THIS IS A BEING. NINE NINE SEVEN WITH RESPECT TO MENTAL HEALTH AND FIRE ARMS OVER WITH A FIREARM THIS THE BILL AS A FOLLOW UP. TO A PREVIOUS BILL THAT WE PASSED I'M STILL ALL LAST YEAR -- THAT WOULD PROHIBIT INDIVIDUALS FROM POSSESSING FIREARMS IF THEY WERE. PUT UNDER FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLDS TWICE -- WITHIN A CALENDAR YEAR -- THIS CLOSES A LOOPHOLE -- BY RESTRICTING THE PURCHASE A FIREARM WIDE THAT INDIVIDUAL IS WAITING FOR A COURT HEARING A WITH ME AT TODAY IS HALEY RENTALS DEPUTY COUNSEL WITH THE COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA AS WELL AS DOCTOR FOR HE ONE FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION. IN ORDER TO THE UNIVERSE THANK YOU FOR HAVING US -- I'M HERE BECAUSE I'M A PSYCHOLOGIST IN A FEW YEARS BACK I WAS ACTUALLY WORKING IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY. WITH A TWENTY THREE YEAR OLD ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER FEMALE WHO'S ACTUALLY SENT TO ME FOR TREATMENT FOR FAMILY REUNIFICATION. AS A RESULT OF PUTTING HER CHILD IN DANGEROUS ENOUGH TO THE LOCATIONS -- THAT SHE ACTUALLY SEPARATE THESE TYPE OF BEHAVIOR BESIDES HER PSYCHOTIC BREAK WAS DRIVING BACKWARDS IN A CAR IN A PARKING LOT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED WITH A CHILD IN THE BACK. AS WELL AS THE SOLUTION WAS SHE WAS BEATING HER SON. DURING TREATMENT SHOWS INCONSISTENT WITH THE MEDICATION AND TREATMENT AND AS WE PREPARE TO THE FINAL COURT CASE -- HEARING A WEIGHT -- TOLL RIGHT WAS GOING TO BE DETERMINED WHEN SURE THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD THAT HER SON WAS GOING TO BE ADOPTED BY HER MATERNAL GRANDMOTHER. WHICH WAS BASICALLY IT -- CLIENTS MOTHER AT THE DATA SHESHA RECEIVED A FINAL COURT -- DECISION TO TERMINATE HER PARENTAL RACIAL SO DISTRAUGHT AND FORTUNE THREE DAYS LATER SHE WAS FOUND DEAD FROM A SELF INFLICTED GUNSHOT WOUND. THIS OBVIOUSLY HAS ACTUALLY A HUGE IMPACT ON ME AS A PSYCHOLOGIST AND THIS IS THE REASON WHY I'M HERE TO SUPPORT SB [inaudible] NINE NINE SEVEN OKAY YES. CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY MY NAME IS HALEY REYNOLDS I'M A DEPUTY COUNTY COUNSEL WITH THE COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA. I'M JOINED THIS MORNING BY THE DEPUTY COUNTY COUNSEL COULD BE THE NARAYAN. IN SUPPORT OF AB. NINE NINE SEVEN IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN A MAN IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY ON A FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLD AFTER HE THREATENED TO COMMIT SUICIDE. LAW ENFORCEMENT CONFISCATED HIS WEAPONS UPON TAKING HIM INTO CUSTODY THE MAN WAS NOT ULTIMATELY ADMITTED FOR A CUTE. ENTRY INPATIENT TREATMENT. AND THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE FILED A PETITION TO PREVENT THE RETURN OF HIS WEAPONS THE MAN RESPONDED TO THE PETITION AND REQUESTED A HEARING. AND DURING THE PREPARATION FOR HIS HEARING HE COMMUNICATED COUNTY COUNCIL THAT HE WAS STILL SUFFERING FROM DEPRESSION AND HAD SUICIDAL THOUGHTS. AT THE HEARING THE COURT FOUND BY A PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE THAT RETURNING THE WEAPONS TO THE MAN WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN A DANGER TO HIMSELF AND ORDERED THAT THE WEAPONS BE DESTROYED. AFTER THE HEARING THE MAN COMMUNICATED TO COUNTY COUNCIL THAT IT DIDN'T MATTER BECAUSE HE COULD JUST GO BUY ANOTHER GOTTEN. UNDER EXISTING LAW DESPITE A COURT ORDER THAT A PERSON WITH MENTAL ILLNESS SHOULD NOT HAVE HIS GUNS RETURNED HE CAN BUY WEAPONS THAT SAME DAY. AB NINE NINE SEVEN SEEKS TO CLOSE THAT LOOPHOLE. THERE IS CURRENTLY NO PROCESS IN THE WELFARE AND INSTITUTIONS CODE TO PROHIBIT GUN OWNERSHIP. FOR A PERSON THAT WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY ON A FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLD BUT NOT ADMITTED FOR TREATMENT. HAD HIS WEAPONS CONFISCATED AND HAD A COURT ORDER ENTERED TO HAVE THOSE WEAPONS DESTROYED. AB NINE NINE SEVEN PROVIDES A LOGICAL AND STREAMLINED SOLUTION TO MODIFY AN EXISTING PROCESS TO KEEP GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF PERSONS WHO MAY USE THOSE WEAPONS TO HARM THEMSELVES OR OTHERS. THANK YOU ANY ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. NAME AN ORGANIZATION PLEASE TIFFANY MATTHEWS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. AMANDA LEVY WITH THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION YOU HEARD THE COMMENTS OF DOCTOR LONG WE ALSO WANTED TO REGISTER SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MORNING MR TURN MEMBERS COREY CELLS ALONE BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION GOOD MORNING MARK -- GEORGE IN THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION AND WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB -- NINE NINE SEVEN THIS OF LAW PROPOSE LAW IS UNNECESSARY GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS ALREADY COVERED THIS AREA AND THEY DO IT BETTER. ON THE EMERGENCY GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER ALLOWS FOR AN EX PARTE ORDER THEN THAT INDIVIDUAL RELINQUISH THEIR FIRE ARMS IMMEDIATELY. AND IN THE CASE OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO THE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL ON A FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLD.% ON AND THE OFFICERS HAVE CONFISCATED THEIR WEAPONS THEY COULD FILE IMMEDIATELY FOR THE FIFTY ONE FIFTY THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO WAIT THE THIRTY DAYS-- PROPOSED UNDER AB -- NINE NINE SEVEN AB -- NINE NINE SEVEN DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR DUE PROCESS OR NOTICE ALL OF WHICH OF THE GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER DOES BECAUSE INDIVIDUAL IS SERVED WITH THE ORDER. THEY GET A HEARING IN FRONT OF A JUDGE AND THERE IF THERE IS NOT AN EMERGENCY THERE'S A THIRTY DAY PERIOD THE FILE A GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER THE SAME AS PROPOSED. IN THIS BILL. ADDITIONALLY EIGHTY NINE ON NINE SEVEN IS IN CONFLICT WITH EXISTING LAW -- THE WELFARE INSTITUTIONS CODE SECTION WHICH THEY SURE I'M SORRY. AB NINE NINE SEVEN IS IN CONFLICT WITH THE ADDITION WITH EXISTING LAW WHICH SAYS IF SOMEONE. IS NOT HOSPITALIZE THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO GET THEIR WEAPONS BACK AND I UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION ON IN URBAN AREAS WHERE THEY ARE THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE VYING FOR BEDS IN PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS. AND THEY OFTEN -- INDIVIDUALS WHO MIGHT BE HOSPITALIZED SOMEWHERE ELSE. ON ARE NOT HOSPITALIZED PERHAPS IN ALAMEDA COUNTY OR SANTA CLARA COUNTY. OR ON SOME OF THE URBAN AREA LOS ANGELES. BUT THE GUN BY EMERGENCY GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER DOES ALL OF THIS AND IT DOES IT AND THAT'S IN THE PENAL CODE. AND IT DOES -- FASTER AND WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS OF NOTICE AND DUE PROCESS. SO -- AB EIGHT NINE NINE SEVEN IS UNNECESSARY AND WE ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISTER QUIRK. SO WE HEAR ON THE ORDER OF THIRTY BILLS EVERY WEEK MOST OF WHICH GET OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE AND THE CASE BEING MADE BY THE OPPOSITION IS GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS DO THIS ALREADY WHICH IS WHAT I BELIEVE AS WELL. PRESSING YOUR CLOTHES YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. BUT MY CONCERN IS AND IT'S THE SAME THE GOVERNMENT LAST GOVERNOR HADN'T WHO KNOWS ABOUT THIS GOVERNOR. IS THAT -- THE AMOUNT OF LOS WE HAVE ON THE BOOKS SORT OF LIKE DOUBLES EVERY FEW YEARS. IT'S HARDER AND HARDER TO KNOWS WHAT LEGAL AND ILLEGAL SO I JUST AS SOON IF IT DOES THE JOB HAVE THE GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER -- TAKE CARE OF IT. OKAY A QUESTIONS CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT. THANKS. I'D BE HAPPY TO ADDRESS THAT -- PULL THE MIKE A LITTLE CLOSER. TO THANK YOU. I'M. THE GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER. SPEAK INTO THE MIKE AND VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS. WE BELIEVE DID NOT ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THIS POPULATION AND IT'S NOT ONLY THAT IT'S NOT ADEQUATE IT'S SIMPLY NOT THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO YOUR POINT OF HAVING TOO MANY LAWS ON THE BOOKS. THE GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER IS ASKING FOR PUZZLE PIECES TO BE DIG SIDE TOGETHER RATHER THAN STREAMLINING AND ARE USING AN EXISTING PROCESS. IF WE WERE TO SAY THAT OFFICERS LAW ENFORCEMENT SHOULD RELY ON GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS THAT WOULD REQUIRE A COMPLETELY SEPARATE PROCESS TO BE PURSUED IN A COMPLETELY SEPARATE COURT -- THE EIGHTY ONE TO PETITION THAT IS FILED IS HEARD IN CIVIL COURT GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY. ARE HEARD IN FAMILY COURT AND THE AB. PETITION PROCESS UNDER EIGHTY ONE OH TWO WOULD STILL HAVE TO HAPPEN. AND ON TOP OF THE GT R. O. BECAUSE OF THE CONFISCATION OF WEAPONS THAT OCCURS IN THE FIRST INSTANCE WHEN SOMEONE IS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY. ON A FIFTY ONE FIFTY SO WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING IS SIMPLY USING THAT EXISTING PROCESS TO ADDRESS THIS PARTICULAR POPULATION THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN INTO CUSTODY. ON A FIFTY ONE FIFTY HAD THEIR GUNS CONFISCATED THERE'S THIS LOOPHOLE THAT ALLOWS THEM TO THEM PURCHASE NEW GUIDANCE RATHER THAN ASKING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND AND DRAINING THOSE PRECIOUS RESOURCES. THAT COULD BE PURSUING GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS THAT ARE MORE NEEDED. THIS ALLOWS THEM TO PROVE TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT THIS WHAT THE EXISTING LIGHTING ONE OH TWO INTENDS WHICH IS TO KEEP GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF SOMEONE. WHO'S BEEN FIFTY ONE FIFTIES AND HAVE THEIR GUNS CONFISCATED. SO. HAS THERE BEEN A YOU KNOW. TO THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S POINT THERE LAST TO PROCESS RIGHTS IN YOUR PROPOSE EACH. MECHANISM FOR EXAMPLE NOTICE RATE SO WHY DON'T HAVE YOU CONSIDERED PUTTING THE SAME DUE PROCESS RIGHTS INTO THIS PROCESS ARE USING THAT. EIGHTY ONE YES OUR OF OUR CAMP THANK YOU FOR RAISING THAT WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF CONSIDERING SEVERAL AMENDMENTS AND THAT IS HIGH ON OUR LIST WE HAVE DRAFTED SOME LANGUAGE ALREADY TO INCLUDE A NOTICE THERE IS CURRENTLY A NOTICE. THAT IS MAILED ALREADY FOR THE CONFISCATION PIECE BECAUSE A PETITION IS FILED THAT TRIGGERS A NOTICE TO BE MAILED TO THE PERSON IN ORDER TO RECEIVE. AN OPPORTUNITY REQUEST A HEARING ON THOSE GUNS THAT ERE CONFISCATED SO THIS WOULD SIMPLY BE AMENDING THAT NOTICE TO ALLOW THEM TO ALSO RECEIVE NOTICE THAT THERE ADD THIS PETITION PROCESS IS ALSO REQUESTING A BAN ON OWNERSHIP FORGOTTEN. FOR GUNS FOR THIS PERSON FOR FIVE YEARS. AND IS THE STANDARD THE SAME IF SEEKING IT THROUGH THE OTHER PROCESSES THIS PROCESS. THIS STANDARD IN EIGHTY ONE OH TWO IS PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE AND I BELIEVE AND CLEAR AND CONVINCING FOR THE GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER -- SO THERE IS THERE IS A DIFFERENT STANDARD BUT THAT IS ANOTHER AMENDMENT WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO CONSIDER OKAY YEAH BECAUSE I THINK THAT THIS BODY HAS SPENT A LOT OF TIME WORKING TO MAKE SURE THE GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER. BALANCE IS THE NEEDS OF THE GUN OWNER ANNE'S. TO BE SAFE AND THE GONNA BE SAFE IN THIS CASE BUT SO I THINK NEARING THOSE RATES WHILE USING A MORE EFFICIENT PROCESS WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE TO ME. I AGREE THOSE ARE CERTAINLY AMENDMENTS WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO CONSIDER. DID YOU. AND IN I JUST WANT TO ECHO THE CONCERNS AB YOU KNOW GENERALLY WHEN I HEAR THE WORD LOOPHOLE. I HEAR THAT IS AN END RUN AROUND DUE PROCESS AND WE HAVE DVR ROSE CURRENTLY ON THE BOOKS -- AND THEY DO COVER ALL POPULATIONS IT'S JUST A MATTER REALLY OF YOU KNOW. THE PROSECUTION FIGURING OUT A WAY TO CIRCUMVENT -- YOU KNOW STANDARDS THAT ARE VERY CLEAR THAT ARE ON THE BOOKS AND HAVING SOMEONE HAVE THE FENCE. TO SHARE COMPELLING EVIDENCE YOU KNOW AGAINST WHATEVER -- MAY BE PRESENTED IN COURT AND SO I YOU CAN KEEP COMMUNITIES SAFE WITHOUT COMPROMISING CIVIL RIGHTS AND CIVIL LIBERTIES AND I WOULD HOPE THAT WE CAN FIND WAYS TO KIND OF STAY IN THAT LANE -- BECAUSE YOU START ENCROACHING -- DOWN A DANGEROUS ROAD OF YOU KNOW BIAS AND PREJUDICE THING -- CERTAIN COMMUNITIES AND SO I WOULD HOPE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THOSE AMENDMENTS. YEAH WE WOULD CERTAINLY BE YOU KNOW ARE WE ARE INTERESTED OF COURSE IN PRESERVING THOSE DUE PROCESS RIGHTS AND I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT. REQUIRING TWO SEPARATE PROCESSES IN TWO SEPARATE COURTS IS ALSO A HINDRANCE ON DUE PROCESS RIGHTS BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PERSON RESPONDING TO ALSO BE. APPEARING IN TWO DIFFERENT COURTS ON TWO DIFFERENT PROCESSES IN EIGHTY ONE OH TWO AND THE GT R. O.. I WOULD ALSO JUST I'M POINT OUT THAT THE GT R. O. IS A GREAT AND USEFUL TOOL AND WE'RE EXCITED TO USE IT IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY. IT WAS I'VE LOOKED AT SOME OF THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT A G. B. R. O. IS REALLY INTENDED TO COVER THE POPULATION THAT IS NOT ALREADY COVERED BY. FIFTY ONE FIFTY I'M IS SPECIFICALLY WAS INTRODUCED IN RESPONSE TO THE ISLA VISTA SHOOTING IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE THE YOUNG MAN HIS FAMILY HAD CALLED TO HAVE POLICE COME. POLICE EVALUATED HIM A DETERMINED HE DID NOT MEET THE CRITERIA FOR FIFTY ONE FIFTY AND AT THAT POINT BOTH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE FAMILY MEMBERS HANDS WERE TIED. INTO THE GT R. O. WAS INTRODUCED TO COVER IT I NEED AND A POPULATION THAT IS BEYOND THAT IS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF MENTAL ILLNESS. AND IT WAS AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE LAWMAKERS THAT FIFTY ONE FIFTY WAS ALREADY COVERING THOSE PERSONS WHO MAY BE DANGEROUS AND MENTALLY ILL. AND SO IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE FIFTY ONE FIFTY IS DOING WHAT WE UNDERSTAND IT TO DO WE JUST SEE THIS AS A NECESSARY -- CLOSURE AND AND OF COURSE WENT TO INSURE DUE PROCESS RIGHT STAY INTACT SO WHERE THE POLICE OFFICE. NINE WHERE THE POLICE OFFICERS NOT TRAINED TO ADEQUATELY DETERMINE. HIS STATE OF MIND OR DID THEY JUST NOT PRESENT EVIDENCE THAT WAS COMPELLING ENOUGH. I CERTAINLY CAN'T SPEAK TO HAVE WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN ON WET WHEN WHETHER THE POLICE OFFICERS WERE PROPERLY TRAINED BUT I DO KNOW THAT THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER SKINNER. AT AND PRESENTED THE BILL AND RESPONSE TO THAT SITUATION. MR COURT YEAH I HAVE ONE OTHER PROBLEM WITH THE BILL. AND THAT IS -- PERSON'S GONNA HAVE A FELONY SO YOU'VE SAID THIS PERSON IS. MENTALLY UNSTABLE. IF THEY GO OUT AND BUY A GUN THEY NOW HAVE A FELONY ON THE RECORD. SINCE MENTALLY UNSTABLE BUT NEVER POSSESS TO GUIDE. THEY CAN GO OUT AND BUY A GUN. AND THEY'VE COMMITTED NO CRIME I JUST FIND PARTICULARLY THE FELONY ASPECT OF THIS. ARE TO BE -- SOMETHING I CAN'T SUPPORT. AT THIS TO ADDRESS THAT CONCERN IF I MAY I'M. THE LANGUAGE THAT WE'VE INCLUDED IN AB ONE OH TWO MIRRORS THE LANGUAGE THAT'S INCLUDED IN EIGHTY ONE OF THREE WHICH IS AB MECHANISM THAT PUTS A BAN ON OWNERSHIP FOR PERSONS WHO ARE COMMITTED -- EXCUSE ME ADMITTED FOR INPATIENT ACUTE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT AND THAT IS WHY WE'VE INCLUDED THAT LANGUAGE IT'S A MAKES IT A WAFFLER. AND WE ARE CERTAINLY OPEN TO AMENDMENTS TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT IS A CONCERN AND TO THE EXTENT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PERSONS THAT ARE MENTALLY ILL AND HAPPEN WHETHER THEY'RE COVERED AND WHETHER THEY CAN HAVE GUN OWNERSHIP. I'M IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT IT'S NOT JUST A QUESTION OF PROBABLE CAUSE OUT IN THE FIELD WHERE SOMEONE IS. ASSESSED TO BE MENTALLY ILL THIS IS REQUIRES A PSYCHIC. PSYCHIATRIST REVIEW BUT THEN ALSO A COURT RUBIO AND THAT'S THE IMPORTANT. THEIR THAT REALLY SEPARATES THOSE POPULATIONS IS THAT A COURT HAS REVIEWED AND FOUND BY A PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE THAT THIS PERSON. SHOULD NOT HAVE WEAPONS BECAUSE OF THE DANGER THAT WOULD PUT. POSE TO THEMSELVES AND OTHERS. OKAY THANK YOU -- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. AND DID YOU WANT. HIM TO THAT'S PARTY OR CLOSED DID YOU WANT. HE RAISING YOUR YOUR WITNESS WILL RAISE YOUR HAND LIKE A JACK IN THE BOX OR HAS -- THANK YOU -- I AM NOT AN ATTORNEY SO NOW HERE ARE YOU LAW I'M A PSYCHOLOGIST I DEAL WITH PEOPLE'S PAIN AND ALSO THE PAIN FOR THE STATE FOR FAMILY MEMBERS OF THOSE WERE DECEASED -- I ALSO MADE EDUCATORS TO DOCTOR LEVEL STUDENTS AS WAS MASTER LEVEL STUDENTS I SUPERVISE AND ALSO OVERSEE A LARGE NO HEALTH. CURRENTLY SO CISCO. I WAS ALWAYS UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE LAW DID PROTECT INDIVIDUALS OR HAVE THEIR GUNS TAKEN AWAY OR FARMS IF YOU WISH IT WERE TO BE. FIFTY ONE FIFTY AND IT REMEMBER IT IS A DANGEROUS SELF OTHERS AND CLEARLY DISABLED AS A RESULT OF A MENTAL ILLNESS -- THE PERSON THAT I SHARED THE STORY WITH I WAS ALWAYS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO ACCESS A FIREARM. AND IF SHE IF THE LAWS WERE ACTUALLY IN PLACE AND THINGS WERE WORKING. ACCORDINGLY I HOPE I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN HERE SPEAKING WITH YOU TODAY SO PLEASE TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU AND MISTER LOW YOU MAKE CLOTHES THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS THAT MADE BY A COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND LOOK FOR TO OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH YOU ON ADDRESSING SOME OF THESE OUTSTANDING ISSUES SHOULD THIS BILL BEFORE. I HAVE A QUESTION OF THE CHAIR. WHICH IS WE'VE HEARD DISCUSSIONS OF AMENDMENTS. WILL YOU TAKE A PERSONAL WELL I SHOULD SAY PROFESSIONAL INTEREST IN THIS [inaudible] OUR TO SURE THAT WE GET THE RIGHT SET OF AMENDMENTS. WELL YOU CAN ANSWER THAT IN HERE -- SO OF THE WAY WE'VE BEEN IN WELL ONE BECAUSE OF OUR OUR CALENDAR AND AMOUNT OF BILLS WE HAVE -- IT KEEPS REAL DIFFICULT TO LIKE PUSH THINGS OFF. TO THE NEXT WEEK AND AT THAT ALMOST AND BEGINNING TO POWER IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. BUT SAYING THAT -- WON THE WAYS WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH SOME OF THESE -- IS WE'VE UP EITHER ALL NON VOTED ALREADY VOTED DOWN A BILL TO GIVE. AND THEN AFTER RECONSIDER AUTHOR THAT'S A RECONSIDERATION SO WE CAN WORK ON IT. DO A VERY LONG PERIOD OF TIME AND SO -- IF IF THAT IS THE CASE -- BECAUSE FOR ME I I HAVE SOME SOME CONCERNS -- TO OBVIOUSLY IT BOTHERS ME -- WHEN WHEN I WHEN YOU STIGMATIZE A WHOLE POPULATION? OF INDIVIDUALS NUMB NO MATTER WHAT -- AND AND I AND I LIKE TO SAY -- I'VE ALSO HEARD PEOPLE SAY HEY LOOK THERE A LOT OF WHITE MALES WHO COMMIT SOME HEINOUS THINGS. AS FAR AS MASS SHOOTINGS AND IS IF YOU LOOK AT MOST A MASS SHOOTING BUT I WOULDN'T TRY TO TAKE STIGMATIZE THAT GROUP OF PEOPLE. AND TRY TO TAKE AWAY ALL OF THEIR GUNS THE ADS WOULD NOT. BE SOMETHING I WOULD WANT TO TO HAVE A QUE PROPOSED OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT AND I'M FEELING THAT WITH PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS BUT ON THE OTHER HAND -- NO ONE WANTS TO BE THERE WHEN THEY RELIEF SOMEONE AND THAT PERSON KIND OF BEEN CONSIDERED A MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM AND THEN THEY DO SOMETHING REALLY HEINOUS OUT THERE. AND THEN THE THIRD THING WHICH I THINK IS THE ROOT OF WHERE WE NEED TO GET TO WHICH IS BEEN SOME IT JUST BOTHERS ME TO IT DRIVES ME CRAZY TO KNOW WHEN -- WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT COMES IN? IT TRIES TO MAKE THEIR JOB EASIER BY SHORTENING TO DUE PROCESS. LAWS SO THEY CAN GET. THEY CAN GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREET FASTER OR QUICKER OR GO AROUND SOME THINGS AND SO IF YOU COULD. YOU KNOW. I'M I'M DOING NANTES SO. ONE BECAUSE FOR ME NOT MUSIC KEEPS UP KEEP THE DISCUSSION GOING. BUT WE ALSO DO KIND OF DISMISS THIS SO THAT WE CAN MOVE ON WITH OUR OTHER BUSINESS BUT ALSO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR. ON TAKING CARE OF THE ISSUE THAT I BROUGHT UP MR QUIRK BROUGHT UP. REBEKAH BAUER CAM BROUGHT UP MISS COME LOADED UP BROUGHT UP AND I KEPT SEEMS TO LACKEY SHAKE HIS HEAD A LOT SO I'M NOT SURE WHERE HE IS -- BUT AS MISTER PURPOSE ST AT LEAST THE DOOR OPEN -- BUT IT DIDN'T GET SUS OFF OF OUR OUR OUR DOCKET SO WE CAN GET TO OUR OTHER BUSINESS -- SO ODD TO CHAIRS RECOMMEND NON. IN -- IN E.. WRECKED NONE. SO CAPTION ONE IS OUR MOTION. WILL MOVE THE BELL. HELLO ON A. B. NINE NINE SEVEN THE MOST XIN IS TO PASSAGE APPROPRIATIONS JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER NOT VOTING LACKEY. NO LACKEY NOPE BAUER-KAHAN HI BAUER-KAHAN I DEEP [inaudible] KAMLAGER-DOVE. KAMLAGER-DOVE NOT VOTING QUIRK. QUIRK NOT VOTING SANTIAGO WICKS. WICKS NOT VOTING. I'M SORRY THAT MEASURE FAILS. ARE YOU AN ASKED RECONSIDERATION NO I'M NOT GO NOT OKAY I DON'T SEEM MISTER GLORIA I'M JUST MAKING SURE HE'S NOT IN A ROW. SO MISTER GRAYSON TIM GRAYSON EUROPE AB -- NINE OH SEVEN I AM TWENTY ONE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I WANT TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR TIME AND ATTENTION ON THIS BILL AND ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS AS PROPOSED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. WITH A SCHOOL OR A PLACE OF WORSHIP IS THREATENED IT CAN DIRECTLY BECAUSE A REASONABLE AND IMMEDIATE FEAR FOR ANYONE WHO SPENDS THEIR TIME THERE. AND FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND LOVED ONES. AB NINE ZERO SEVEN WILL MAKE IT A CRIME TO THREATEN TO COMMIT AN ACT THAT WILL KILL OR SERIOUSLY HARM ANYONE ON THE GROUNDS OF A SCHOOL OR RELIGIOUS INSTITUTION. UNDER CURRENT LAW IN ORDER TO BE PROSECUTED A THREAT MUST BE SPECIFICALLY DIRECTED TOWARDS ONE OR MANY INDIVIDUALS HOWEVER IN OUR CURRENT CLIMATE THREATS AREN'T JUST BEING MADE TOWARD. INDIVIDUALS BUT INSTEAD AGAINST ENTIRE SCHOOLS SYNAGOGUES MOSQUES AND CHURCHES OUR NEWSPAPERS AND NEWS FEEDS ARE FILLED WITH TERRIBLE HEADLINES OF CRIMES BEING COMMITTED AGAINST TARGETED GROUPS OF PEOPLE. OVER FIFTY MUSLIMS MURDERED IN A MOSQUE IN NEW ZEALAND ELEVEN JEWISH WORSHIPPERS MURDERED IN A SYNAGOGUE IN PITTSBURGH PENNSYLVANIA. A PREDOMINANTLY BLACK CHURCH IN KENTUCKY TARGETED BY A GUNMAN SCHOOL CHILDREN MURDERED AT SANDY HOOK AND AT PARKLAND. WHEN A STUDENT SEES A POST ON SOCIAL MEDIA THAT ANOTHER STUDENT WANTS TO KILL AT LEAST THIRTY STUDENTS ON THE LAST DAY OF SCHOOL? THE FEAR THEY FEEL IS REAL. THAT EXAMPLE IS A REAL ONE THAT HAPPENED IN MY DISTRICT IN PLEASANT HILL. DESPITE THAT COMMUNICATED THREATS INTERVENTION BY THE FBI AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT MULTIPLE GUNS BEING SEIZED FROM THE STUDENTS HOME AND MULTIPLE INDIVIDUALS AFRAID FOR THEIR SAFETY. PROSECUTORS WERE UNABLE TO PURSUE A CRIMINAL THREAT CHARGE BECAUSE OF HOW THE LAW IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN AB NINE ZERO SEVEN WILL UPDATE OUR PENAL CODE TO REFLECT THE INTENT OF THE LAW. AND TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE THEY ARE TREATING THREATS AGAINST OUR SCHOOLS AND PLACES OF WORSHIP WITH GRAVITY THAT THEY DEMAND. MY WITNESS TIFFANY MATTHEWS WITH THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT OF THESE ASSOCIATION IS WHAT THIS TODAY. THANK YOU YES MA'AM CHAIR AND MEMBERS TIFFANY MATTHEWS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION. WE ARE THE SPONSOR OF AB NINE OH SEVEN AND AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON POINTS OUT. THERE HAS BEEN AN ALARMING INCREASE IN GUN VIOLENCE INCIDENT THAT SCHOOLS. THESE INCIDENCES BECAUSE FEAR. IN ARE DETRIMENTAL TO PUBLIC SAFETY IN THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION THAT SCHOOLS PROVIDE. WE'D LIKE TO STOP THESE INCIDENTS BEFORE THEY HAPPEN BUT IT IS DIFFICULT TO PROSECUTE THESE CRIMINAL THREATS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT DIRECTED AGAINST A SPECIFIED INDIVIDUAL. AS IS REQUIRED UNDER CURRENT LAW. THIS BILL WILL ALLOW PROSECUTORS TO HOLD THESE INDIVIDUALS ACCOUNTABLE. THEREBY PROVIDING A MECHANISM TO ENSURE THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES FOR MAKING THE SERIOUS THAT. YOUR QUESTION I VOTE. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. BUT ANY WITNESSES OPPOSITION MARGOT GEORGE FOR THE CALIFORNIA ANDERS ASSOCIATION OF WE RESPECTFULLY ASKS FOR YOUR NO VOTE. ALL WE LIVE IN REALLY PAINFUL TIMES ANA. AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER HAS SPOKEN. ABOUT WITH WHITE SUPREMACIST TACKING CHURCHES SYNAGOGUES AND MOSQUES. WE ALL WANT TO DO SOMETHING TO STOP THE ATTACKS. ON HIM AS A MEMBER OF A TARGETED GROUP -- I CERTAINLY FEEL VULNERABLE IS PROBABLY MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM. TO BAD AB NINE OH SEVEN IS NOT THE SOLUTION. AB NINE OH SEVEN WOULD EXPAND THE CURRENT DEFINITION OF CRIMINAL THREATS AND CREATE A NEW CRIME OF CRIMINAL THREATS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SCHOOL OR PLACE OF RELIGIOUS WORSHIP. UP THE CURRENT STATUTE PENAL CODE FOR TWENTY TWO IS VERY PROBLEMATIC. FOR PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND THEIR CLIENTS THIS -- EXPANSION WOULD NOT STOP -- WORE A WHITE SUPREMACIST OR OTHER -- PEOPLE WHO ARE INTENT UPON. CREATING FEAR AND MADE HIM. THE PEOPLE THIS HONEST PROPOSED STATUTE WOULD CAPTURE ARE MY CLIENTS THE MENTALLY ILL -- AND I WANT TO GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES. UNDER THE CURRENT STATUTE WITH THIS WOULD BE A FURTHER EXTENSION OF WE HAD A CLIENT ON A ROGER WHO WAS A MARINE CORPS OF FAT. HE SUFFERED FROM PTSD. HE CAME ON TO CALIFORNIA FROM ANOTHER STATE. ANA WITHOUT SUFFICIENT MEDS FOR A CONVENTION HE WAS ATTENDING FOR VETERANS. HE DIDN'T BRING ENOUGH MEDS AND AS A RESULT TO HAVE THE EPISODE OF HEARING VOICES. AND SMELLING DEAD BODIES WHICH REQUIRED HIM TO ACTUALLY BE. FIFTY ONE FIFTY THE DOCTOR AT THE HOSPITAL SAID WELL YOUR SYMPTOMS DON'T MEET THE CRITERIA AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ADMITTED AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO EVEN GIVE YOU MESS -- THE VET SAID WELL WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO. TO GET SOME HELP. AND THE DISCHARGE PLANNER JUST TOLD THEM WHAT THE CRITERIA WAS AGAIN SO. HE SHE SAID DANGER TO HIMSELF OR OTHERS. SO THE ROGER SAID WELL I'LL GET A GUN. AND I'LL SHOOT MYSELF FOR THE STAFF HOUSE THAT. SO THEY CALLED THE POLICE AND ARRESTED HIM FOR A FELONY. FOR TWENTY TWO OF TERRORIST THREATS FOR TWENTY TWO IS A FELONY AND IT'S A STRIKE -- THIS EXPERIENCE OF BEING OFF YOUR MEDS AND THEN JUST SAYING THINGS. ON FOR SOME PEOPLE IS NOT UNCOMMON WE HAD ANOTHER CLIENT WHO WAS IN HIS LATE FIFTIES. AND HE'S TOLD HIS FRIEND HE WAS GONNA BLOW THE BUILDING UP. HIS FRIEND CALLD THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HELP ASKING FOR HELP. ANY THEY WERE TOO HE WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. THE POLICE PROMPTLY ARRIVED AND ARRESTED HIM. FOR FOR FOR TWENTY TWO THE PROBLEM IS FOR TWENTY TWO DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY ACTION IT JUST REQUIRES WORDS. AND IT APPLIES EVEN IF THE PERSON WHO WAS SAYING THE WORDS HAS NO. ACTUAL INTENT OF CARRYING OUT THE THREAT. OUR CONCERN IS THAT EXPANDING THE SCHOOL IN SNEER MORE PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS. INTO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND CERTAINLY A SYMPATHETIC TO THE INTENT BEHIND THE BILL. BUT WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR NO VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CATHY SURE ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA -- AND I WANT TO JOIN IN THIS GEORGE'S COMMENTS BUT I ALSO JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT -- FIRST FIRST THAT THIS IS. NOT A BILL ABOUT WHERE THERE IS AN ACTUAL ACT TO CARRY OUT THE THREAT. ON THE IT IS ONLY ABOUT THREATS AND NOT EVEN KNOW IT NECESSARILY THREATS WHERE THERE IS ANY INTENT TO CARRY OUT THE THREAT -- BUT ALSO THAT THIS BILL IS IT'S NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING TO LESSEN THE NUMBER OF THREATS TO SCHOOLS AND PLACES OF WORSHIP -- AND PLACES OF WORSHIP SIMPLY BECAUSE THE THREATS COVERED UNDER THE BILL CAN ALREADY BE PROSECUTED UNDER EXISTING LAW. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SO OVERCOME BY ANGER NOW THAT THEY MAKE THESE THREATS WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONSEQUENCES ARE NOT GOING TO STOP BECAUSE THIS BILL HAS BEEN PASSED. IT'S NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING TO CHANGE THOSE CON THOSE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES. EIGHTY NINE OH SEVEN IS SIMPLY UNNECESSARY AND WE URGE AND HOPEFUL. THANK YOU ARE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS MR QUIRK. SILVA ARM YOU PROBABLY GET HERE WE HAVE WE'RE SIR TO DOUBLING THE SIZE OF THE CRIMINAL CODE EVERY FEW YEARS FOR THAT REASON I HAVE CONCERNS BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S ALREADY CRIME. THE D. A.'S REPRESENTATIVE SAID THAT THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO PROSECUTE THE CASE GIVEN HOW TOUGH THE CURRENT LAW IS THAT WAS PROBABLY GOOD REASON FOR IT IN PARTICULAR. THE SUPREME COURT HAS IDENTIFIED CASES WHERE FOR EXAMPLE OF A TALK HERE IN THE ANALYSIS ABOUT SOMEONE POSTING ON FACEBOOK AND THE SUPREME COURT DECIDED THAT THAT WASN'T. BOB. A THREAT THAT IT WAS -- EXERCISE OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT SO YOU ALSOHAVE THE DIFFICULTY THIS LAW MAY WERE INTO FIRST AMENDMENT PROBLEMS. SO I JUST DON'T THINK I CAN VOTE FOR THIS BILL [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] KAMLAGER-DOVE. SO I TO WANT TO ECHO SOME OF THE CHALLENGES RAISED BY MY COLLEAGUE -- WE HAVE CLOSE TO SIX THOUSAND LAWS IN THE PENAL CODE -- AND SO I GET THAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS I DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW THAT ALL OF THE SOLUTIONS ARE COMING FROM OR THROUGH PUBLIC SAFETY SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS ARE FAR MORE UNCOMFORTABLE. AND NEBULOUS AND NUANCED. AROUND. MAYBE THIS COUNTRY BEING. IN THE MIDST OF A MENTAL HEALTH EPIDEMIC AND NONE OF US REALLY ADEQUATELY KNOWING HOW TO DEAL WITH TRAUMA -- THERE IS A COLD PENAL CODE FOR TWO TWO IS ALREADY ON THE BOOKS THIS IS REALLY DUPLICATIVE LANGUAGE. THE LAW THAT'S CURRENTLY ON THE BOOKS SAYS YOU CANNOT DO ANY OF THESE AGAINST A PERSON. THIS WOULD ACTUALLY SAY YOU CAN'T DO THIS -- STATE A KIND OF THREAT AGAINST A PLACE. YOU KNOW WE ARE SORT OF MOVING THE NEEDLE. FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY -- AND REALLY. THE BAR FOR PROSECUTION IS SO LOW AND I JUST GET CONCERNED THAT WE'RE FIGURING OUT WAYS TO CHIP AWAY AT THAT ALREADY LOW THRESHOLD -- AND AND WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO END UP I DON'T KNOW. I I QUESTION KIND OF IF YOU HEAR SOMETHING SOME KIND OF THREAT BEING SAID. YOU KNOW YOU ALSO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHO WAS THE RECIPIENT WHO WAS THE PERSON HEARING THAT AND HOW ARE THEY HEARING IT AND HOW ARE THE INTERPRETING IT. SO NOW ARE WE BASING LAWS BASED ON HOW SOMEONE INTERPRETS WHAT THEY HEAR. WE'RE ALSO NOT TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION -- WHAT HAPPENS SO. EIGHTY YOU CAN I BRING FIREARMS TO A SCHOOL YOU CANNOT BRING DRUGS YOU CAN I BRING MAYES YOU CANNOT BRING KNIVES WE MAY GET TO A POINT WHERE PEOPLE AREN'T EVEN BRINGING BOOKS -- BUT THOSE THINGS ARE ALREADY ILLEGAL. AND THEN WE HAVE TO HAVE REAL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW STUDENTS ARE ACTUALLY BEING TREATED. AT SCHOOLS IF BULLYING IS HAPPENING IF THEY'RE BEING HARASSED BY MAYBE EVEN PEOPLE WHO WORK AT THE SCHOOLS. AND IF THEY'RE SAYING THESE KINDS OF THINGS BECAUSE THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE ANOTHER WAY TO COMMUNICATE AND THEY'RE ANGRY AND THEY'RE SCARED AND WE'RE NOT REALLY TALKING ABOUT BULLYING. WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT WAYS TO ONCE AGAIN A RACE THE LIGHT THAT IS DUE PROCESS. AND FIGURING OUT WAYS TO INCARCERATE SO MANY PEOPLE AND WE HAVE BEEN PUTTING PEOPLE IN BOXES FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS AND IT'S NOT WORKING THIS IS NOT ANSWERING THE QUESTION. ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE. WE CAN USE. FOR TWO TO PEOPLE GET LOCKED UP MANY A TIME MANY A DAY BECAUSE OF THAT CODE. I THINK WE HAVE THE TOOLS ON THE BOOKS ALREADY. AND I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE JUST TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO USE THE TOOLS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE IN THE CODE RATHER THAN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO PUT EVERY PERSON IN JAIL THAT WERE AFRAID UP. AND WE'RE TOO UNCOMFORTABLE TO HELP. SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE AMENDMENTS WOULD LOOK LIKE BUT I'M ACTUALLY INTERESTED IN BILLS THAT TALK ABOUT THOSE ISSUES. AND AS A RESULT OF THAT I AM NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO SORT PART THIS BILL [inaudible] YES [inaudible] BUT NO [inaudible] OKAY. SO I THINK YOU KNOW YOU REYES SORT OF A MUCH LARGER POINT THAN JUST THIS BILL ABOUT PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS BEING TAKEN IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM INSTEAD OF INTO THE CARE THAT THEY DESERVE AND NEED AND SHOULD BE TREATED. TO AND I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE ADDRESSING IS THAT. THERE SHOULD BE A SEPARATE AVENUE FOR THOSE THAT ARE SUFFERING FROM MENTAL ILLNESS RATHER THAN WE LACK THAT TREATMENT RIGHT NOW AND SO. THEY ARE BEING. PICKED UP BY THE POLICE THEIR BEEN PUT INTO JAILS AND SEVEN TO MENTAL HEALTH FACILITIES AND I THINK THAT IS A LARGER QUESTION. THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS THROUGH HEALTHCARE AND THROUGH MENTAL HEALTH CARE IN MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO BE TREATED AND NOT. CRIMINALIZED FOR MENTAL ILLNESS THAT BEING SAID YOU KNOW I SEE EVERY DAY THE RISE IN THESE KIND OF THREATS. TO YOU KNOW MY OWN SYNAGOGUE AND WE HEAR THAT OUR LOCAL SCHOOLS AND YOU KNOW WE DO. I AM OF THE OPINION THAT WE NEED TO BE GIVING LAW ENFORCEMENT THE TOOLS TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE SAFE AND OUR PLACES OF WORSHIP. IN OUR SCHOOLS BECAUSE WHEN I DROP MY KIDS OFF TO SUNDAY SCHOOL. OR TO SCHOOL IN THE MORNING. THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE SAFEST PLACE FOR ME TO TAKE THEM. AND CURRENTLY IT ISN'T. THANK YOU. AND YOU MAKE CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I DO WANT TO REITERATE THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR ATTENTION. THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN TO THIS AND THE HARD WORK THAT YOU OF PUT IN TO WITH MY STAFF AND I DO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS HAS PROPOSED AS PROPOSED BY THE COMMITTEE -- IT IS UNFORTUNATE OF THE GROSS GENERALIZATION OF THIS SUBJECT BY A COLLEAGUE ON THE COMMITTEE -- BECAUSE IT'S NOT -- THE SAME AS THE LAW THAT EXIST IT DOES EXPAND IT TO SCHOOLS AND TO PLACES OF WORSHIP. THE DIFFERENCE IS IS THAT IF I MAKE A THREAT TO JOHNNY. THAT IS PROSECUTABLE BUT IF I MAKE A THREAT. TO TO A JEWISH SYNAGOGUE. THEN I AM NOT PROSECUTED NIGHT DO HAVE A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE OF HOW THAT TOOK PLACE AND MY DISTRICT. AND IS FAR AS MENTAL HEALTH IS CONCERNED -- AND THE ARGUMENT -- BY THE OPPOSITION AND I APPRECIATE AND RESPECTFULLY -- WANT TO ADDRESS THAT AS FAR AS IF THE ARGUMENT IS THIS BILL DOESN'T STOP THREATS. TO SCHOOLS INTO PLACES OF WORSHIP WELL THE BILL ALREADY EXIST IN THE FORM OF LAW IN THIS SENSE OF INDIVIDUALS. THEN I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THE SAME ARGUE WOULD BE WITH THE OPPOSITION THAT THE CURRENT BILL DOESN'T STOP THREATS AGAINST INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR APPS TO WRITE IT DOESN'T STOP IT. BUT IT DOES ALLOW US TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST IT AND MAKE IT -- CONSEQUENTIAL AND WHAT THIS BILL WILL DO THOUGH IT MAY NOT STOP A THREAT WHAT THIS BILL WILL DO IS MAKE A CONSEQUENTIAL. AND YOU CAN'T JUST STAND UP IN AN AIRPORT AND OUT OF ANGER SAY ON A BLOW THIS PLACE UP. AND EXPECT TO WALK OUT FREE AND THE SAME THING I BELIEVE IS THAT EVEN IN YOUR MIDST OF ANGER. AND AND FOR SOMEONE AS A CHAPLAIN OF THE CONCORD POLICE DEPARTMENT SITTING IN THE FRONT SEAT OF THAT CAR LISTENING THE FIRST RESPONDERS. ACTUALLY GOING AND AND HOPING AND WORKING WITH VICTIMS OF SCHOOLS THAT HAD TO GO TO SCHOOL UNDER A THREAT. THAT -- I SEE THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT THREAT AND SO ALL I'M ASKING FOR IS THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT IF SOMEONE DOES NEED THE HELP THAT WE HAVE THIS TOOL IF IT'S A MENTAL ISSUE -- AND MENTAL HEALTH -- PRESCRIPTIONS REQUIRED THEN THIS PROCESS COULD VERY WELL HOPE SOME FOLKS THAT WOULD HAVE NEVER RECEIVED HELP. FIND THEMSELVES IN A PLACE THAT ELENA RHETORIC HOPE IS BEING RECEIVED. SO ALL I ASK FOR IS THAT WE LOOK AT WHAT CURRENTLY EXIST. AND EXPAND THAT TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT IF YOU DON'T NAME THE PERSON BUT YOU ACTUALLY NAME THE PLACE. THEN THAT COUNTS AS WELL. WAS BY WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. AND THANK YOU AND I THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE AT THE AMENDMENTS -- I WAS TO COMMITTEE. ON CHAIRS ARE WORKING REAL HARD WITH YOU SO WE COULD. WORK OUT A LOT OF THE ISSUES OF I JUST. WOULD LIKE TO JUST MAKE ONE RECOMMENDATION THERE'S THERE'S A TERM OF ART OR IS A TERM THAT'S USED. AMONG PEOPLE HERE -- WHICH IS -- THROUGH THE CHAIR AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS NONE OF THESE COMMENTS ARE PERSONALLY TOWARD YOU EARN. FOR ANOTHER COMMITTEE IS NOT TOWARD ANOTHER WITNESS -- AND THAT'S WHAT YOU SAY TO THE CHAIR SO HOPEFULLY -- AT WHICH I PROBABLY SHOULD SOME OTHER WITNESSES WHO REALLY GET. I UNDERSTAND GETTING PASSIONATE WELL TO IT. MAKE SURE IT'S MISTER CHAIR WHAT ARE THE AMENDMENTS IT'S NOT CLEAR FROM THE ANALYSIS. WHAT ARE THE AMENDMENTS AND BECAUSE?

THROUGH THE CHAIR -- THE AMENDMENTS DEAL -- ESSENTIALLY -- DELETE THAT -- THERE HAS TO BE A DISRUPTION AT THE SCHOOL -- THE AMEND TO BE WHAT THEIR HAT THE THE BILL AS AS ORIGINALLY DRAFTED REQUIRED THAT THERE BE A JUST AN ACTUAL DESTRUCTION AT THE SCHOOL OR PLACE OF WORSHIP THAT WAS DELETED BECAUSE THE THE THREAT IS WHAT HAPPENS -- THE AMENDMENTS -- CLARIFY THAT IT'S ESSENTIALLY THE THEY NOW MAY MAKE THE CURRENT STATUTE BUT CLARIFY THAT -- A PERSON CAN BE AND REASONABLY SUSTAINED FEAR FOR THEMSELVES OR ANY OTHER MEMBER OF THE CONGREGATION OR THE SCHOOL.

THANK YOU THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT -- OTHERS IN SUPPORT. WHEN MISTER RYAN CHIN WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT [inaudible] ALL RIGHT [inaudible] OPPOSITION. MORNING MR MEMBERS ACROSS YOUR HERNANDEZ A BE HAVE THE COVER TURN CALIFORNIA TURNS REMOTE JUSTICE WE HAVE AN OPPOSE LESS AMENDED. OPPOSITION I'VE BEEN IN COMMUNICATION THE OTHER STAFF WE JUST HAVE A SMALL AMENDMENT TO THE BILL I WANT TO THANK ON THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING ON THIS ISSUE. I WAS WANT SOME CLARIFICATION THAT BOTH THE VISOR E. OF COMMITTING TRAIN -- ALL IS ALSO INCLUSIVE OF THE CANNELLA FENCE ATTORNEY SAYS WE HAVE PROSECUTORS INVOLVED WITH EVERYTHING AND BE BACK GOOD BALANCED APPROACH AND CAN BE HELPFUL HAVE ALL SIDES THERE. TO MAKE SURE WE GET IT RIGHT TO THE SMALL ISSUE WE'RE HAVING DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE -- LOOK FORWARD TO RESOLVING THAT [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE ARE IN OUT. IN OPPOSITION. OKAY SCENE NO ONE OUR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CAN LUMBER DOVE. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- YOU KNOW THIS ISSUE IS IMPORTANT TO ME -- I ACTUALLY -- KNOW OF AN INSTANCE WHERE A YOUNG MAN WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES -- WAS SEXUALLY ABUSED. AND ASSAULTED -- AND AS A RESULT HER IN SPITE OR BECAUSE OF THOSE THINGS WAS ALSO ACTING OUT. BUT BECAUSE THERE'S A LACK OF AWARENESS ABOUT THIS COMMUNITY AND THIS ISSUE [inaudible] WAS PROSECUTED. AND IN FACT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE SAID. WE KNOW HE HAS DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. ANDWE KNOW HE NEEDS MENTAL HELP SUPPORT. BUT THAT'S PROSECUTOR. FOR THE WIN. AND GET JAIL TIME. AND THEN ASKED THE JUDGE TO GET HIM HELP. AND THAT'S REALLY NOT HOW WE SHOULD BE TREATING INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. AND THAT'S NOT HOW WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT THEM. SO I APPLAUD THIS BILL. I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE MORE CONVERSATIONS WITH REGIONAL CENTERS. AND WITH DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICES BECAUSE IN FACT ALSO IN THIS CASE THE REGIONAL CENTER VIOLATED THIS YOUNG MAN'S HIPPA. RIGHT. TO HELP GET HIM PUT AWAY. I WOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE THAT YOU TAKE THE AMENDMENTS BECAUSE I THINK THAT -- ANYONE WHO PLAYS A ROLE IN -- THE PROTECTION OF RIGHTS AND DUE PROCESS. AND IS A PART OF THIS ENVIRONMENT SHOULD ALSO PARTICIPATE IN GETTING THESE TRAININGS AND THAT INCLUDES PUBLIC DEFENDERS -- AS WELL SO I HOPE YOU LOOK INTO THOSE AMENDMENTS THANK YOU FOR THIS BILL THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. MR FRAZIER YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR. AND ONE OF THE THINGS OF AND I I APPRECIATE THE THOUGHTFULNESS OF THE THE POSCO THE COKE CRIMINAL -- DEFENDING ATTORNEYS -- THIS IS ALREADY AN EXISTING PROGRAM IN THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES THE DA'S PARTICIPATING. THIS JUST ADDS ADDITIONAL CURRICULUM IF WE WERE TO ADD ALL OF THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND CRIMINAL. JUSTICE ATTORNEYS IN CALIFORNIA THIS WOULD NEVER GET OUT OF APPROPRIATIONS -- SO ONE OF THE THINGS A GOOD REASON AND SO THIS IS A STEP. THAT'S ALREADY AN EXISTING PROGRAM THAT WE'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO AUGMENT. AND THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO SO AND I THINK THAT ANY INTERESTED PARTY AT IN THE NEXT COMING SESSION WHO'D LIKE TO TEAM WITH ME. I THINK THAT IT'S AN APPROPRIATE METHOD IF WE CAN FIND THE REVENUE SOURCE TO MOVE FORWARD AND MAKE SURE THAT THE THE IN OTHER INDIVIDUALS HAS EVERY OPPORTUNITY. TO HAVE THE THE THE TRAINING ALSO. YEAH WELL WE ALL KNOW THE TRAP. IT'S CALLED APPROPRIATIONS AND GIVEN THAT I'M I'M GOING TO VOTE YES AS WELL -- I DO HOPE THAT WE CAN DO SOMETHING FURTHER DOWN THE LINE. BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR EVERYONE TO BE TRAINED IN THE SENSITIVITY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS -- WE DO HAVE THE CASE OF SOMEONE WHO WAS ACTUALLY PROSECUTED AND THAT. CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL IF THAT TED DEFENDING ATTORNEY HAD HAD SOME TRAINING -- SO. I'M HI THE CHAIR IS URGING AN AYE VOTE -- MADAM SECRETARY -- WE HAVE TOGETHER MOTION A MOVE THE BILL MASTERMAN. SECOND THANK YOU. SO MOTION BY MISTER DO YEP -- AND THE SECOND BY POWER CON.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB -- EIGHT NINETY THREE THIS MORNING THIS IS A DISTRICT BILL A BILL THAT IS IN RESPONSE TO THE OVERWHELMING CALL FROM MY CONSTITUENTS. A BIT FOR OUR DISTRICT AGRICULTURAL ASSOCIATION THE TWENTY SECOND AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT TO STOP SELLING GUNS AND AMMUNITION ON STATE PROPERTY. AS MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE ARE NO DOUBT AWARE THE PLAGUE OF GUN VIOLENCE IS PRESENT IN NEARLY EVERY CORNER OF OUR STATE. JUST LAST YEAR NEARLY FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE DIE FROM GUNS IN UNITED STATES THE HIGHEST IN THE LAST IN FIFTY YEARS. REGRETTABLY RARELY A WEEK GOES BY WE'RE NOT ANOTHER SENSELESS TRAGEDY OCCURS INVOLVING GUNS. TO OBVIOUSLY. ALL OF US ARE THINKING ABOUT THOSE AFFECTED BY THE TRAGEDY NEW ZEALAND. WE SEEN TOO MANY OF THESE TERROR OF ANTS HAPPEN IN OUR SCHOOLS ARE PLACES OF WORSHIP. AND OUR COMMUNITIES. FORTY FOR THOSE OF US WHO BELIEVE WE WERE SENT HERE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM WE NOW HAVE ENGAGED IN ACTIVE CITIZENRY. AS THE WIND ON OUR BACKS I HAVE OVER A DOZEN OF MY CONSTITUENTS HERE TODAY TO OFFER MORE THAN THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS. MEMBERS WE ARE HERE FOR ACTION. ACCORDING TO A STUDY OF THE SAN DIEGO ASSOCIATION OF GOVERNMENTS JUST CRIMINAL JUSTICE CLEARING HOUSE NEARLY THREE QUARTERS 73% OF ALL HOMICIDES IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN INVOLVED A FIREARM. IN THE SANDY REGION JUST OVER HALF 53% OF ALL HOMICIDES INVOLVED A GUN. AS WITH ALL OF MOVE MANY OF YOUR DISTRICTS MY CONSTITUENTS DIDN'T WAIT FOR STATE OR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO RESPOND. LAST YEAR CITIZENS FROM THE FROM DELMAR ENCINITAS SOLANA BEACH AND ALL ACROSS THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO PETITION THE DEL MAR FAIR BOARD THE STATE ENTITY THAT GOVERNS THE ACTIVITIES AT THE DEL MAR FAIRGROUNDS. TO STOP ITS COMPLICITY AND PROFITING OFF OF GUN SALES THAT END UP IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND THEY HEARD US LOUD AND CLEAR IN RESPONSE THE FAIR BOARD AGREED WITH THE COMMUNITY AND VOTED TO INSTRUCT STAFF TO EXPLORE POLICIES TO PHASE OUT STATE SANCTIONED GUN SHOWS. THE BOARD INSTRUCTED THE STAFF TO EXPLORE GUN SAFETY -- AND EDUCATIONAL EVENTS FOR GUNS AND AMMUNITION WERE NOT SOLD BUT UNLIKE OTHER AGRICULTURE DISTRICT BOARDS ARE BORED LISTENED AND HEEDED THE CALL TO EXPLORE THE PROHIBITION OF GUNS AND AMMO FOR SALE. AS YOUR ANALYSIS NOTES -- THE GUN THE WORK TO BAN GUN SHOWS IS CURRENTLY ON HOLD AS THE BOARD AWAITS THE DISPOSITION OF A LEGAL CHALLENGE BY THE GUN SHOW VENDOR. I WOULD NOTE THAT THAT GUN SHOW VENDOR CROSSROADS OF THE WEST HAS FILED SUIT AGAINST THE BOARD ACTION DESPITE BEING UNDER INVESTIGATION BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. THE DOJ IS CURRENTLY REVIEWING THE CERTIFICATE OF ELIGIBILITY OF ONE OF THE PROMOTERS OF THE SHOW GIVEN AN APPARENT FELONY CRIMINAL BACKGROUND. MEMBERS AB EIGHT NINETY THREE IS A DISTRICT BILL THIS LEGISLATION ONLY IMPACTS OUR ARMS THAT ARE SOLD AT THE SEVEN EIGHT IN THE SEVENTY TO ASSEMBLY DISTRICT AND DOES NOT THE IMPACT THE ABILITY FOR OTHER AGRICULTURAL ASSOCIATIONS TO SELL WEAPONS ON THEIR PROPERTY. I HAVE A DOZENS OF MY CONSTITUENTS WHO HAVE FLOWN UP HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF OUR SHARED COMMUNITY. AND I HOPE THAT YOU'LL HEAT OUR CALL TO IN THE SHOW'S ONCE AND FOR ALL. I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE IN WITH ME THIS MORNING YEAH I HAVE ROSE AND SHARP CO FOUNDER OF NEVER AGAIN CALIFORNIA AND NOW IN HARD AND HARDENS. POSITION FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO. WAS IN. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN MY NAME IS ROSEANNE SHARP AND I SPEAK IN FAVOR OF ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT NINETY THREE AUTHORED BY TODD GLORIA. AND ASK FOR YOUR VOTE I RESIDE IN THE SEVENTY EIGHTH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT I AM THE FOUNDER OF NEVER AGAIN CA OUR NAME AND OUR MISSION. COME FROM THE STUDENTS AT PARKLAND WE BELIEVE THIS LEGISLATION RESPECTS AND PROTECTS THE LIVES AND RIGHTS OF ALL THE CITIZENS WITH SEVENTY THREE GUNS STORES IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY. A GUN SHOW ON A STATE OWNED PROPERTY IS OVERKILL LITERALLY. THE PRESENCE OF GUN SHOWS AT THE FAIRGROUNDS NORMALIZES THEIR USE IT SAYS GUNS ARE OKAY HERE. LAST SUMMER A TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD MAN FIRED HIS GUN INTO A CROWD WHEN HE COULD NOT BUY A TICKET FOR SOLD OUT DEL MAR CONCERT. GUNS DO NOT JUST KILL IN MAINE GUNS DO GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL DAMAGE THIS WEEKEND WE LEARNED THAT A SECOND STUDENTS SURVIVOR OF THE PARKLAND SHOOTING. SURVIVED PHYS PHYSICALLY BUT NOT PSYCHOLOGICALLY. BECOMING THE SECOND TO PARKLAND STUDENT AND A SINGLE WEEK TO COMMIT SUICIDE. LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM WROTE TO THE DEL MAR FAIRPORT. QUOTE IF CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO PERMIT THE SALE OF FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION ON STATE OWNED PROPERTY WE ARE SENDING A SIGNAL THAT WE VALUE THE SALE OF FIREARMS ABOVE THE LIVES OF AMERICANS. WE HAVE LETTERS OF SUPPORT FOR THIS LEGISLATION FROM THE ELECTED OFFICIALS OF THE NEIGHBORING CITIES DEL MAR SELANNE BEACH IN ENCINITAS. WHO REPRESENT OVER SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND VOTERS? THE NRA AFFILIATED PROMOTERS OF THE DEL MAR GUN SHOWS SAID THE GUN SHOWS ARE SAFE. NEVER AGAIN PROVED OTHERWISE WE UNCOVERED CRIMES FROM THE POLICE REPORTS WE UNCOVERED THAT TO FELON CONVICTED. FROM FEDERAL FIREARMS VIOLATIONS HAD BEEN THE PROMOTER OF THE GUN SHOW. MEMBERS OF THE DEL MAR VERY BORED AND COVERED MORE IN THEIR OWN INSPECTION OF THE GUN SHOWS THEY VOTED TO SUSPEND THESE GUN SHOWS. THE STATE DOES NOT BELONG IN THE BUSINESS OF PROMOTING. AMPLE IF THE PROLIFERATION OF FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION AND PROFITING FROM THE SALES ON STATE OWNED PROPERTY. THE STATE DOES BELONG IN THE BUSINESS OF INSURING PUBLIC SAFETY AND THAT IS WHY WE APPEAR AN APPEAL TODAY TO YOU FOR YOUR VOTE I URGE A YES VOTE THANK YOU -- THE VICE CHAIR IS NOW HERE SO I'M GOING TO HAND THE GAVEL OVER TO THE VICE CHAIR. LADIES AND GENTLEMAN. I AM HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB BILL. EIGHT NINETY THREE TO HELP REDUCE THE NUMBER OF GUNS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AS A RESIDENT OF THE SEVENTY EIGHT ASSEMBLY DISTRICT AND DEL MAR FAIR ATTENDEE OVER SEVERAL DECADES AS WELL AS A PROFESSOR OF ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY. AT UC SAN DIEGO. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND. THE TO STOP RENTING. THIS STATE OWNED PROPERTY FORGOTTEN SHOWS. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS I HAVE BECOME VERY CONCERNED ABOUT STATE OWNED PROPERTY IS. TAKING MONEY FROM GUN SHOWS. AND THE ADVERSE AFFECTS. OF GUN SHOWS HAN OUR COMMUNITY. GUN SHOWS ARE NOT SAFE. FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT GUN SHOWS LEAD TO THE PROLIFERATION OF GUNS AND GUN VIOLENCE. I JOINED THE FACULTY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX TO HELP DIAGNOSE AND TREAT COMPARTMENT SYNDROMES IN TRAUMA PATIENTS. ONE BECAUSE OF COMPARTMENT SYNDROME. IS A GUNSHOT WOUND. AND THESE ARE VERY DAMAGING. TO MUSCLES AND BONES. AND WITH DEVASTATING AND DEADLY COMPLICATIONS [inaudible] THIS CONDITION. HAS VERY SERIOUS EFFECTS ON VICTIMS AS WELL AS THEIR FAMILIES. MORE OVER. LEGAL GUNS WHICH ARE ILLEGALLY MODIFIED WITH KITS SOLD AT GUN SHOWS. ARE EVEN MORE DAMAGING. WE ARE PROUD THAT OUR RESEARCH AT UC SAN DIEGO. HAS HELPED DECREASE THE MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. CAUSED BY GUNSHOT WOUNDS. HOWEVER. IN THE SAME WAY AS OUR COMPARTMENT SYNDROME RESEARCH. HAS HELPED. SURGEONS AND PATIENTS. WE NEED MORE RESEARCH ON GUN VIOLENCE. FROM THIS STANDPOINT STATE OWNED FAIRGROUNDS WOULD SERVE CALIFORNIA BETTER THROUGH GUN SAFETY EDUCATION. IT HAS BEEN MY PRIVILEGE. AND DUTY TO ATTEND. SEVERAL OF DEL MAR FAIR BOARD MEETINGS AND SEVERAL PROTESTS LINES. OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS TO PROMOTE GUN SAFETY. WITH THE ABOVE CONSIDERATIONS IN MIND I ASK YOU TO SUPPORT AB EIGHT NINETY THREE TO PROHIBIT GUN SHOWS. AT OUR STATE OWNED FAIR GROUNDS. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY TODAY.

GOOD MORNING I'M MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CAPPING LYNCH REPRESENTING -- THE NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION SAFARI CLUB INTERNATIONAL OUTDOOR SPORTS SINCE COALITION CALIFORNIA SPORTSMEN'S LOBBY ALL ON OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. I WANT TO FIRST THANK THE THE COMMITTEE OF FOR THAT VERY THOROUGH ANALYSIS IS ISSUE HAS A RICH HISTORY -- IN THE LEGISLATIVE ARENA. AND I CAN SAY I WAS ONE OF THE PARTICIPANTS WHEN WE DEVELOP TO THE GUN SHOW ALL LOSS IN CALIFORNIA. WHICH HAVE BEEN SORT OF A LANDMARK REALLY IN THE COUNTRY AND EVEN ON THE UC DAVIS A RESEARCHER WHO WOULD PORTRAY HIMSELF AS ANTI GUN. HAS -- INDICATED THAT THE GUN SHOWS IN CALIFORNIA ARE A MODEL FOR THE NATION -- WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE SOMETHING THAT GETS MISSED A LOT OF THE TIMES IN THAT WHEN THERE ARE GUN SHOWS THEY OCCURRED DURING THE DAYTIME ON THE WEEKENDS. BUT ALL THE APPLICABLE LAWS IN THE PENAL CODE ON ALL STATE LAWS ARE COMPLIED WITH BY ALL THE VENDORS IT'S NOT THAT YOU CAN GO TO A GUN SHOW. AND WALK OUT WITH A FIREARM YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE WAITING PERIODS AND ALL THOSE -- SAME PROCESSES THAT EXIST -- FOR EVERYONE ELSE. THAT MIGHT DO A TRANSACTION AT A STORE FRONT -- ONE OF THE CONCERNS OVER THE YEARS -- AND CONTINUES TO BE A CONCERN IF YOU DON'T PROVIDE A VENUE FOR A PRIVATE PARTY TRANSFERS I'VE THERE'S AN ESTATE SALE SOMETHING LIKE THAT THE GUN SHOW BECOMES A PRETTY USEFUL VENUE FOR THE OUT LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE PAST IT'S BEEN CONCERNED. ABOUT THE BANNING OF GUN SHOWS WHICH WOULD DRIVE THE UNDERGROUND -- SELL SELLING OF FIREARMS AND THAT ALSO WAS POINTED OUT IN THE UC DAVIS STUDY. IN ADDITION -- I NOTE THAT THIS IS STATE PROPERTY AND THAT MEANS THAT THE TAXPAYERS HAVE ACCESS TO IT THERE ARE FIRST AND SECOND AMENDMENT ISSUES WITH THIS. AND I NOTICED THE WITNESS IN SUPPORT TALKED ABOUT CONCERTS YES OUR CONCERTS AT THOSE BEEN USE THOSE OCCUR AT NIGHT AND I THINK IF YOU CHECK THE RECORD YOU'LL SEE. THERE ARE MANY MORE LAW ENFORCEMENT CALLS ON THINGS THAT GO WRONG IT CONCERTS. FOR EXAMPLE -- THE ANALYSIS ALSO DOES POINT OUT -- THAT THERE THERE IS A LAWSUIT PENDING IN THE FEDERAL COURT ON CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THIS AND THE BOARD DOES HAVE THIS UNDER REVIEWS SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE THINK THAT THAT -- THE CURRENT STATUTES ARE ARE PERFECTLY FINE AND THAT -- WE SHOULD ALLOW ALL THE THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA TO ACCESS OUR STATE FACILITIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE RECORD DâN RE WITH NATIONAL RIGHT TO ASSOCIATION ALSO HERE. FOR GUN OWNERS THE CALIFORNIA MISTER PRENTICE HAD AN EMERGENCY WASN'T ABLE TO MAKE IT -- MY COLLEAGUE MISS WHEN SHE COVERED EVERYTHING I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT -- ALL STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS APPLY AT A GUN SHOW IT'S JUST LIKE PURCHASING A FIREARM AT A BRICK AND MORTAR NOTHING CHANGES YOU STILL NEED A FIRE SAFETY CERTIFICATE THERE STILL A TEN DAY WAITING PERIOD THERE STILL IS ALL THE APPLICABLE. PAPERWORK AND BACKGROUND CHECKS SIX CETERA SOME STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT FARMS ACQUIRED A GUN SHOWS ARE NOT MORE LIKELY TO BE USED IN A CRIME. THIS IS JUST -- AN EFFORT TO TO BE BàN OF THE CULTURE OF FIREARMS YOU'VE HEARD THAT FROM SOME OF THE WITNESSES TODAY -- THEY WANT TO GET RID OF THEM. THIS ISN'T ROOTED IN PUBLIC SAFETY WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT HERE COMING SAYING WE NEED TO BAN GUN SHOWS. AND I ALSO WANT TO REITERATE THE THE FACT THAT THERE IS A PENDING LEGAL CHALLENGE ON FIRST AND SECOND AMENDMENT GROUNDS -- INCLUDING PRIOR RESTRAINT EQUAL PROTECTION WITH THAT WERE OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. WE WERE SPEAKING ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA RIFLE AND PISTOL ASSOCIATION STRONG OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL IN THE ATTIC THE HIGHLIGHT IS TO PREVIOUS GOVERNORS HAVE BEAT OF THIS EXACT PIECE OF LEGISLATION.

NINE FIFTY NINE I AM. TWENTY FOUR GOOD MORNING MR VICE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR HEARING MY BILL THIS MORNING WHICH IS AB. NINE FIVE NINE THIS BILL PROVIDES ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING VERTICAL PROSECUTION PROGRAMS IN UP TO ELEVEN COUNTIES HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS A FORM OF MODERN DAY SLAVERY THAT MANIPULATE SOME FORCES VICTIMS. INTO SEXUAL EXPLOITATION AND PHYSICAL LABOR VICTIMS ARE TRAFFICKED NOT ONLY FROM STATE TO STATE BUT FROM OTHER COUNTRIES. VERTICAL PROSECUTION UNITS INVOLVED ONE OR MORE STAFF TURN ANY EXCUSE ME ATTORNEYS WHO HAVE SPECIALIZED TRAINING TO HANDLE CASES JUST LIKE THIS FROM ARRAIGNMENT TO CONVICTION. THIS PROSECUTION MODEL BENEFITS VICTIMS WHO ARE ALREADY UNDER A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TRAUMA IT WOULD NO LONGER. NEED TO CONTACT MULTIPLE ATTORNEYS TO DEVELOP A RELATIONSHIP WITH EACH ONE OF THEM. AB NINE FIVE NINE WOULD REQUIRE THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES TO ALLOCATE FUNDING FOR VERTICAL PROSECUTION PROGRAMS AGAINST HUMAN TRAFFICKING CRIMES FOR UP TO ELEVEN COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY OFFICES. IN ADDITION CALLOW YES WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATOR LEGISLATURE OUTLINING THE NUMBER OF PROSECUTIONS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASES THE NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS IN THE SENTENCES IMPOSED. ATTORNEYS PERFORMING VERTICAL PROSECUTION PROVIDE THE CONSISTENCY AND EXPERTISE NECESSARY TO CONDUCT SEPARATE SUCCESSFUL PROSECUTION OF THESE CALMS COMPLEX CASES. THIS BILL IS SPONSORED BY THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY MIKE KESTER IN AND IS SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION CRIME VICTIMS UNITED THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION. RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION AND THE CATHOLIC CONFERENCE HERE TO TESTIFY TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IS GARY PAUL Q. IS RIVERSIDE COUNTY DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY. REPRESENTS HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS IN RIVERSIDE COUNTIES DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE THANK YOU MISTER MISTER VICE CHAIR. GIVE. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING. IT'S AN HONOR FOR ME TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY BECAUSE I COME AT THIS ISSUE FROM A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FRONTS. I COME AS A FATHER WHO WANTS TO PROTECT HIS CHILDREN FROM THE DANGERS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. AS A COMMUNITY MEMBER THAT SEEKS TO CREATE A SAFER COMMUNITY WHERE EVERY MEMBERS VALUED AND PROTECTED. BUT I ALSO COME AT THIS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF BEING ANTI A WHO AND DEALS WITH HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASES ON A REGULAR BASIS. AS SOMEONE WHO SEES THE NEED AND VALUE FOR VERTICAL PROSECUTION UNIT. LAST YEAR I DON'T WHAT THE KEYS WERE SIXTEEN ALL GIRL FROM MODESTO WHICH TRAFFICKED. OUR DRAFTERS TOOK HER FROM A GROUP HOME IN MODESTO TO SANTA CLARA DOWN TO BAKERSFIELD TO LOS ANGELES ORANGE COUNTY SAMBAR LATINO. LAS VEGAS RIVERSIDE AND SHE WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE STATE ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS AS FAR AS LOUISIANA. FINALLY BEING RECOVERED IN MONTEREY COUNTY. I TELL YOU ABOUT THAT CASE BECAUSE OF THE MANY LESSONS I THINK THAT CAN BE LEARNED FROM IT. HER CASE IS NOT AN ANOMALY. BUT RATHER CALM WE OFTEN SHARED WAR WE OFTEN SEE THE MOVEMENT OF VICTIMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. SECOND IT TOOK A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT I RELIED ON ASSISTANCE FROM MY COLLEAGUES IN SIX DIFFERENT COUNTIES TO ASSIST ME TO LOCATE HER AND BRING HER TRAFFICKER TO JUSTICE. BUT THE BIGGEST TAKEAWAY I TOOK FROM MY CASE WAS THE DIFFERENT DYNAMICS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASES AND THE SKILLS SENATE APPROACH NEEDED WOULD DEALING WITH OUR VICTIMS. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND OUR VICTIMS AND UNDERSTAND THE UNDERLYING ISSUES THAT THEY MAY BE DOING WORK. AND WE MUST CONTINUE TO LEARN THE TECHNIQUES OF TRAFFICKERS. ALSO BEST PRACTICES TO BE USED IN FIGHTING AGAINST THIS TERRIBLE CRIME. OR VERTICAL PROSECUTION UNIT WOULD ALLOW PROSECUTORS TO COMBAT HUMAN TRAFFICKING THEY'RE NOT ONLY CONVICTIONS BUT ALSO PREVENTION BY WORKING WITH OUR LOCAL NGOS SCHOOLS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. WERE ALSO EIGHT IN PROVIDING A TRAUMA CENTERED APPROACH WHEN DEALING WITH OUR VICTIMS AND BENEFIT THOSE SEEKING VACATION RELIEF UNDER PENAL CODE SECTION TWO THIRTY SIX POINT. ONE FOUR THIS BILL WOULD RESULT IN A POSITIVE CHANGE FOR COMMUNITIES AND STATE. THIS BILL IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IT'S SOMETHING THAT MUST HAPPEN AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. TIFFANY MATHIS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. MARIA JOSE FERNANDEZ FLOORS CALIFORNIA CATHOLIC CONFERENCE IN SUPPORT. RANGER WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT. DON CAP KEY ON BEHALF OF CRIME VICTIMS UNITED OF CALIFORNIA ALSO IN SOME. KATIE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SAYING NINE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I MAKE A MOTION OF THE BILL THIS. YEAH SO I YOU KNOW I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I I DON'T KNOW THAT I THINK THAT THIS IS A HUMAN TRAFFICKING BILL I FEEL LIKE THIS IS A FUNDING BILL -- AND IT'S A BUDGET BILL MASKING AS A POLICY BILL AND I WOULD WONDER WHY THIS HASN'T GONE THROUGH -- BUDGET SUBDIALECTS T. YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE DO HAVE LAWS ON THE BOOKS AS IT RELATES TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING -- AND ALSO SEX TRAFFICKING -- AND JUST ALSO QUESTION WHY. IT'S ALL FUNDING FOR A DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICES BUT ALSO NO FUNDING -- FOR PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND I KNOW THAT WAS IN THE ANALYSIS I DON'T KNOW IF MEANT THAT WAS ADDRESSED OR IF THERE'S SOME AMENDMENTS OR IF THAT'S BEEN ADDRESS. SO THE REASON THAT THIS BILL IS -- HERE FIRST AND NINE AND BUDGETS OF FIVE IS BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THE THE BILL WAS CUTE ON THAT WASN'T UP TO ME IF I HAD MY DECISION AS TO WHERE THE BILL WOULD GO WOULD GO STRAIGHT TO THE FLOOR. BUT THIS BILL IS IN THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE -- AS FAR AS THE FINDING THIS IS HOW WE THIS IS HOW THIS THIS BILL WAS STRUCTURE IN THE PAST -- THIS BILL IS COME TO THIS COMMITTEE TWICE -- AND WHILE YOU ARE CORRECT THAT THERE IS SOME FUNDING ATTACHED TO THIS THIS HAS BEEN THE CASE ALL ALONG WHICH HAS BEEN APPROPRIATED MY MIND INTERNAL SAYS MIND HE WAS VOTED FOR IT -- WE COULD CERTAINLY YOU KNOW WE COULD TRY TO PUT SOMETHING IN THE BUDGET BUT I THINK THIS IS A POLICY MATTER AS WELL WITH RESPECT TO HOW THESE CASES ARE PROSECUTED -- AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF THIS AS AS YOU ARE WELL AWARE I'M SURE IS. IS THE CONTINUITY OF CARE FOR THESE VICTIMS WHICH IS A POLICY ISSUE WHICH IS WHY. I THINK IT IS IN THIS COMMITTEE THEY'LL WASN'T MY DECISION BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONCERNS. KIM'S LETTERS RIVERS NO OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY CLOTHES WILL BE SHORT I WILL JUST -- TELL YOU THAT. IF IF YOU'VE LISTENED TO THE STORIES OF VICTIMS. WHO -- MANY OF THEM VERY YOUNG -- MANY OF THEM. WERE FORCED INTO THIS SOME OF THEM. WERE WILLING PARTICIPANTS IN TO WHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS A RELATIONSHIP AND NOT A TRAFFICKING ISSUE AND THEN FIND THEMSELVES IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY CAN'T GET OUT. SO TO TELL YOUR STORY TO SEVERAL DIFFERENT PEOPLE ALONG THE WAY AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IS VERY TRAUMATIC. IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO TELL ONE PERSON AND REMEMBER YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO. IF YOU DON'T COME FROM A FAMILY UNIT WHERE THEY FELT SAFE AND COMFORTABLE -- IN DISCUSSING WHAT WAS GOING ON THAT THAT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY THEY LAUGHED. SO TO PUT THEM THROUGH THE ADDED TRAUMA OF TELLING. ONE PERSON AND ANOTHER PERSON AND ANOTHER PERSON WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM HE END UP IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY DON'T WANT TO TELL ANYONE -- OR THEY JUST WALK AWAY FROM THE PROSECUTION ALTOGETHER NO LONGER PARTICIPATING WITNESS WHICH IS NOT WHAT WE WANT TO SEE IN THIS LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN VERY GOOD. ABOUT BRINGING FORWARD BILLS TO TRY TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE WHICH IS GROWING -- AND TRY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT SO WITH THAT -- I WILL JUST TELL YOU THAT. I'M I CERTAINLY RESPECT YOUR CONCERNS ALTHOUGH I THINK WE'RE PROBABLY ON THE SAME PAGE WITH HOW WE DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE -- AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE THANK YOU. OKAY I GUESS YOU WOULD CALL FOR THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE A FIRST AND SECOND. ON EIGHTY NINE FIFTY NINE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. LACKEY HI LACKEY AYE BARRICADE HAND AYE BARRICADE HAND I DEEP. DEEP I KAMLAGER-DOVE. KAMLAGER-DOVE NOT VOTING QUIRK SANTIAGO. SANTIAGO I WICKS WICKS I THE MEASURE PASSES THANK YOU. WE'RE ALMOST CERTAIN GAMES OR ONE ASSEMBLYMEMBER ALMOST YOU MAY PROCEED. AB. FOR THIRTY THREE ITEM NUMBER. FOUR I'VE MOVED THE BILL MESSAGER. EVERY OF LOTION. AND SECOND YOU MAY PROCEED SIR THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- FIRST I WANT TO START OFF. BY STATING THAT I WILL ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. IN AB FOR THREE THREE INSURERS THAT VICTIMS OF CRIME CAN RETAIN THEIR PEACE OF MIND. AND PURSUE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO RESTITUTION. THIS BILL REQUIRES CRIME VICTIMS WERE PROSECUTING ATTORNEYS TO BE MADE AWARE OF EARLY TERMINATION OF PROBATION. CURRENTLY THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT TO NOTIFY CRIME VICTIMS WHEN A PROBATION TERM IS TERMINATED EARLY BY THE COURT'S ORDER. THIS CAN LEAD TO SITUATIONS WHERE VICTIMS ARE UNAWARE OF THE TERMINATION OF PROBATION IN THEIR CASES. THIS NOTIFICATION WILL ENSURE THAT VICTIMS OF CRIME ESPECIALLY VICTIMS OF INTERPERSONAL OR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ARE AWARE OF THESE CHANGES IN PROBATION TERMS. WHICH MAY INCLUDE BANDS ON CONTACTING SPECIFIC PEOPLE. MARCY'S LAW CONSTITUTIVELY MANDATES PROPER RESTITUTION FOR VICTIMS OF CRIME. THIS MANDATE FOR HEALING A HEARING WILL ENSURE THAT OF VICTIMS CONSCIOUS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO RESTITUTION IS CONSIDERED BEFORE THE EARLY TERMINATION OF PROBATION. THIS WILL ENSURE THAT THE VICTIM OF CRIME CAN BE MADE WHOLE TO AN OPPORTUNITY TO PER SERVER PURSUE PROPER RESTITUTION. AND WITH ME TODAY IS DONE KEPT KEY REPRESENTING THE CRIME VICTIMS UNITED THE SPONSOR OF THE BILL. YOU MAY PROCEED. I THINK YEAR OLD JOHN CAP KEY MCCUE CAPTAIN ASSOCIATES ON BEHALF OF CRIME VICTIMS UNITED OF CALIFORNIANS STRONG SUPPORT. WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH US ON SOME AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL -- IMPORTANTLY FROM CONVICTIONS UNITED SIDE FEEDBACK I'M VICTIMS ARE REQUIRED TO BE PROVIDED RESTITUTION TO COVER ECONOMIC LOSSES ASSOCIATE WITH THEIR VICTIMIZATION. BUT THERE ARE SOME OCCASIONS THAT ARISE WHERE THE VICTIMS LOSSES MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BE FULLY QUANTIFIED AND DETERMINE PRIOR TO SENTENCING -- CURRENT LAW ALLOWS FOR RESTITUTION TO BE REVISITED BUT THAT MUST OCCUR PRIOR TO THE END OF TERM AT THE END OF PROBATION. WHEN THE COURT ULTIMATELY LOSES JURISDICTION OVER THE DEFENDANT THE CHALLENGES THE VICTIMS MAY NOT HAVE A WAY OF KNOWING THAT THEY NEED -- TO PERHAPS PETITION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF ADDITIONAL RESTITUTION IN CASES WHERE -- PERHAPS ADDITIONAL MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELLING -- WAS -- EXCEEDED THE AMOUNT OF RESTITUTION ORIGINALLY PROVIDED A PERHAPS ADDITIONAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH A RELOCATION FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS WHAT HAVE YOU. ASSEMBLY BILL FOUR THIRTY THREE SIX TO PROVIDE VICTIMS THAT NOTICE -- TO TO ENSURE AN OPPORTUNITY TO THE EXTENT THAT THE VICTIM HAS REQUESTED TO BE NOTIFIED OF THESE TYPES OF OCCASIONS I TO GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THE CASE FOR ADDITIONAL RESTITUTION -- BASED ON COSTS INCURRED. RELATED TO THEIR VICTIMIZATION ABOVE WHAT WAS PROVIDED AT THAT A SENTENCING PERIOD. SO FOR THESE REASONS WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S WORK WITH US ON STRONGLY URGE RIGHT VOTE THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. TIFFANY MATH IS A MAP OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. RANGER WITH RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION WE REPRESENT THE PROBATION OFFICERS AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY INVESTIGATORS IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. AND WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU. KATHY SURE FOR THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA WHERE WE'RE NOT IN SUPPORT BUT I DID WANT TO NOTE THAT WE WOULD HAVE REMOVED OUR OPPOSITION BASED ON THE AMENDMENTS AND THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. TAKING. OKAY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OKAY. QUESTIONS REQUIREMENTS FOR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. CATION AROMA SHE MAY CLOSE. ALL I'M SORRY I MISSED SOMEBODY. THIS KAMLAGER-DOVE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FOR A DAY -- I DON'T KNOW MAYBE I WOKE UP IN SOME KIND OF MOOD TODAY -- YEAH I HAVE I DO HAVE -- SOME CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL I APPRECIATE THE A SO YOU -- STEPPING FORWARD BUT I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL ENCROACHING UPON DOUBLE JEOPARDY -- VICTIMS ALREADY. ARE INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS AND CAN BE NOTIFIED I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THIS RE INSERTING THE PROSECUTION RE INSERTING -- THE DA'S OFFICE IS -- BACK INTO A PROCESS WHERE THEY NO LONGER HAVE A ROLE -- WHAT YOU END UP HAVING IS SORT OF A NEVER ENDING PROSECUTORIAL INVOLVEMENT -- IN CASES THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN ADJUDICATED. I DON'T KNOW THAT WE ALWAYS WANT TO REAWAKEN. THE DA'S OFFICES IN THESE ISSUES AND WHEN. CASES DO COME BEFORE JUDGES -- THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED A VICTIM'S IMPACT STATEMENT THAT IS. PRODUCED. THAT IS HEARD -- AND THAT IS PLACED INTO THE RECORD -- AND JUDGES MONITOR THESE CASES AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU IF THERE ANY SHENANIGANS OR ANY KIND OF YOU KNOW. A MAN AGAINST HAPPENING -- THAT ALSO IS IN VIOLATION AND WILL BE BROUGHT BEFORE THE JUDGE USUALLY ON FOLKS ARE ASKING FOR EARLY TERMINATION IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO GET A JOB THEY'RE TRYING TO GET A LOAN THEY'RE TRYING TO MOVE ON WITH THEIR LIFE. AND THIS SORT OF KEEPS THEM ON THIS NEVER ENDING FERRIS WHEEL OF INCARCERATION -- VICTIMS ALREADY ARE [inaudible] SQUARELY PLACED IN THE MIDST OF THIS PROCESS -- SO I JUST HAVE. TO JUST SORT OF STATE THAT I HAVE THOSE -- KINDS OF CONCERNS WITH THESE -- WITH THESE KINDS OF CASES -- LAWS -- THAT ARE BROUGHT BEFORE US AND AND WHY WE NEED TO INVOLVE A DISTRICT ATTORNEY TO KIND OF JUST JUMP BACK INTO THE MIX AND FIGURE OUT A WAY -- TO DENY FOLKS THE ABILITY TO KIND OF REHABILITATE. AND MOVE ON WITH THEIR LIVES IS CONCERNING I JUST WANTED TO REGISTER THAT CONCERN. OKAY NOW YOU MAY CLOSE WILL THINK IT AND IN RESPONSE TO THAT -- IN PART OF OF THIS MOVING FORWARD AND ACTUALLY ENSURES THAT THE VICTIM WILL BE NOTIFIED RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT SENATE STONE THAT THEY ARE NOTIFIED DURING THIS TIME. THEY HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD TO THAT. I THINK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER I JUST KNOW -- TO UNDER CURRENT A STATUTE TODAY THE PROSECUTING ATTORNEY IS GIVEN A NOTICE ARE READY AND THESE CASES -- WE ARE JUST SEEKING FOR KIND OF A VERY SMALL SUBSET OF CASES WHERE A VICTIM WHAT ARE BE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM AS SOMEONE THAT PERHAPS IS VICTIMIZED HAS ADDITIONAL COUNSELING ABOVE THE RESTITUTION ORDERED AGAIN SOME OF SOMETIMES SOME OF THOSE -- COSTS ARE HARD TO DETERMINE AT THE TIME OF SENTENCING -- WE DON'T NECESSARILY BELIEVE THAT THERE WILL BE A YOU KNOW AN INORDINATE TO NUMBER OF CASES WHERE A VICTIM YOU KNOW WHAT ACTUALLY PURSUE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK OUT ADDITIONAL RESTITUTION. BUT IN THOSE CASES WHERE KIND OF TO DAY ARE PROVIDED NOTICE AT LEAST THEY HAVE THAT ABILITY TO BE NOTIFIED AND AND AND SEEK THAT OUT BUT THE PROSECUTORS ALREADY GIVEN NOT NOTICE UNDER CURRENT LAW AT THIS TIME. PRIDE IN THE LANGUAGE ARE A I'M IS. VIOLENCE OR RIGHT [inaudible] YOU'RE NOT. THIS BILL AND WE'RE NOT SPECIFIC -- AND CASES ARE GOING TO PRICE TAG RIGHT -- CHARACTERS IN YOUR RANK NO SO IT IT'S VICTIMS WHO AND CURVE ACOSTA SENSITIVE THEIR VICTIMIZATION DAY AGAIN WOULD HAVE. TO YOU KNOW MAKE THAT CASE TO THE COURT FOR WHY YOU KNOW THE COURT SHOULD EVEN CONSIDER ADDITIONAL RESTITUTION ABOVE WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY I PROVIDED -- SO IT'S NOT AN AUTOMATIC WHERE THE VICTIM WOULD BE AUTOMATICALLY GIVEN THE UP THAT ADDITIONAL YOU KNOW -- RESTITUTION AMOUNTED DATES THEY WOULD HAVE TO DAM BEING COMING UPON THEM TO MAKE THE CASE FOR THAT WHETHER IT'S DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM -- WHETHER TO SEXUAL SOLD THAT -- A STOCKING OUT WHAT HAVE YOU SO IT'S I MEAN THE THE BURDEN WOULD BE ON THE VICTIM THEMSELVES TO WORK WITH THE PROSECUTOR -- IN YOU KNOW TO SEEK ARE KIND OF THAT OPPORTUNITY BUT IT WOULD BE IN EVERY CASE IT WOULDN'T BE A WHOLE SLEW OF CASES WE WOULD EXPECT. ALL DUE RESPECT IT'S TIME FOR THE CLOSE. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND AYE AYE AGAIN REITERATING THAT WE DO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE THERE. ELECTRIC RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE.

THREE FORTY IS THAT FOUR FIVE FIVE I CAN'T READ OR SIX FOUR BUT I CAN'T READ YOU'RE HANDWRITING. WELL LET ME TELL YOU WHICH ONE SHE'S GOING FIRST [inaudible] JUST. FOR FIVE AB TWELVE FIRST. YES. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHAIR JONES SAWYER AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB TWELVE TO THIS MORNING AND WITH THAT WILL -- MAKE A CHANGE AND TWO CLARIFICATIONS RELATING TO GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS. I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AS LAID OUT IN THE MOCK UP ATTACHED IN THE ANALYSIS. AB TWELVE IS ONE OF A PACKAGE OF BILLS THAT I'M OFFERING THIS SESSION IN RESPONSE TO THE BORDERLINE SHOOTINGS IN MY DISTRICT THAT TOOK THE LIVES OF TWELVE OF MY CONSTITUENTS LAST FALL. YOU DID VOTE ON THE FIRST BILL WHICH ESTABLISHED A G. V. R. O. POLICY A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO. I SPENT THE LAST FEW MONTHS WORKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS INCLUDING INDIVISIBLE TO DEVELOP LEGISLATION THAT COULD WORK TO AVOID ANOTHER TRAGEDY LIKE THE ONE INFLICTED UPON MY COMMUNITY. WE ARE OWES AS MANY OF YOU KNOW OUR NEW TOOL THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS CREATED TO PRO ACTIVELY INTERVENE IN DANGEROUS SITUATIONS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. WHILE MOST TV ARE OWES BEGAN AS ORDERS THAT LAST TWENTY ONE DAYS THE COURT MAY ORDER YOUR LONG PRO -- PROHIBITION AFTER NOTICE TO THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE HEARING. AB TWELVE PROVIDES PROVIDES JUDICIAL DISCRETION TO SET THE TIME PERIOD FOR A JEEP YARO. AFTER NOTICING HEARING -- BETWEEN ONE TO FIVE YEARS TO ALLEVIATE THE BURDEN TO THE COURTS FAMILIES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT TO EXTEND THE GDR ROSE ON A YEARLY BASIS. IF THE G. V. R. O. [inaudible] OF ORDER FROM WAS LONGER THAN ONE YEAR THE INDIVIDUAL WOULD RETAIN A YEARLY ABILITY TO PETITION THE COURT FOR MOBILE OF THE ORDER ALLOWING INDIVIDUALS WITH. WHO NO LONGER POSE A DANGER TO RECOVER THEIR FIREARMS BUT THE COURT WOULD NOT NEED TO REVIEW ORDERS EVERY YEAR -- SO -- IF YOU HAVE SOMEBODY THAT IS A STRONG LIKELIHOOD OF CONTINUING DANGER LIKES THOSE BASED ON A A DIAGNOSIS OF ALZHEIMER'S OR DEMENTIA. THE BILL ALSO CLARIFIES THAT THE ALLOWANCE AN EXISTING LAW FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS TO STORE OR SELL FIREARMS TO REGISTER DEALER ONLY APPLIES WHEN AN EX PARTE OR NOTICE AND HEARING TV ARE ALWAYS SERVE BY CIVIL PROCESS SERVER. NOT WHEN A TV ARE -- IS SERVED BY A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER THIS AVOIDS THE NONSENSICAL INTERPRETATION THAT A PERSON WHO IS LAW ENFORCEMENT AND A JUDGE BELIEVE IS DANGEROUS IS ALLOWED TO HAVE AN ENTIRE DAY TO DO AS THEY PLEASE WITH A FIREARM. HERE TODAY WITH ME IS VENTURA COUNTY SHERIFF BILL A YUBA SPONSOR OF THE BILL SURE FOR YOU.

TO YOUR NEXT -- ONE I WILL NOW BE PRESENTING AB -- THREE FORTY SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX THE DOJ HAS MAINTAINED THE ARMED AND PROHIBITED PERSON SYSTEM PROGRAM AN AUTOMATIC DATE OF AN AUTOMATED DATABASE THAT CROSS REFERENCES GUN REGISTRATION DATA. WITH LISTS OF PROHIBITED PERSONS A PERSISTENT BACKLOG OF OVER TEN THOUSAND POTENTIALLY ARMED INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE APP SYSTEM UNDERLINES THE NEED. FOR A NEW APPROACH DESPITE RECEIVING OVER TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN TWENTY FOURTEEN HIGH RATES OF VACANCIES AND TURN OVER. AMONG SPECIAL AGENTS LAND AB THREE FORTY CREATES A PILOT PROGRAM TO FIND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TASK FORCES THAT WOULD DISARM PROHIBITED PERSONS WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTION. I'M ALSO LEADING A BUDGET ASK WITH OTHER MEMBERS THAT WOULD FUND THIS PILOT PROGRAM DIVERTING A SMALL PORTION OF THE ADDITIONAL FIVE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS THAT GOVERNOR NEWSOME PROPOSED IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET FOR THE APPS PROGRAM. WITH NO SOLUTION TO STAFFING IMPEDIMENTS THAT THE DOJ TO ALLOW THE APPS PROGRAM TO BE FULLY STAFFED AND LAST YEAR'S NUMBERS SHOWING IT IS MORE LIKELY THAT A PROHIBITED PERSON WILL DIRE HAVE THEIR PROHIBITION EXPIRE RATHER THAN THE DOJ -- AGENT INVESTIGATING THEM IT'S TIME TO EXPLORE A NEW APPROACH THAT AUGMENTS THE WORK OF THE DOJ. HERE WITH ME TODAY IS VENTURA COUNTY SHERIFF DELAY YOU. SPONSOR AGAIN OF THE GOOD MORNING AGAIN MORNING MEMBERS -- FOR THE RECORD BILLION SHERIFF OF ENTER CANDY I AM PLEASED TO COME HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB. THREE FORTY WHICH CREATES A PILOT PROGRAM FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO HELP REDUCE BACKLOGS. IN ASSURING THE COMPLIANCE OF THOSE PROHIBITED FROM POSSESSING FIREARMS. AB THREE FORTY IS ONE MORE OF A HANDFUL OF BILLS THAT STEM FROM THE CONVERSATIONS. THAT WERE SPURRED AS A RESULT OF THE VIOLENCE AT THE BORDERLINE BAR AND GRILL IN NOVEMBER. AND I BELIEVE BUILDS UPON CALIFORNIA'S. LEADING GUN LAWS RELATED TO GUN VIOLENCE. MY DEPARTMENT MANY OTHERS CROSS STRAIT THE STATE OF A STRONG INTEREST IN BEING A FORCE MULTIPLIER FOR THE DOJ. AND REDUCING THE APPS BACKLOG. A RECENT SWEEPS INVOLVING LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OF DEMONSTRATE THE VALUE OF LEVERAGING LOCAL OFFICERS IN THIS EFFORT. THE SHERIFFS AND POLICE OFFICERS ARE WELL EQUIPPED TO CONDUCT APPS INVESTIGATIONS. BECAUSE OF OUR FAMILIARITY WITH OUR COMMUNITIES AND RESIDENTS. WE SERVE AND ARE USUALLY PROHIBITED DUE TO FELONIES AND MISDEMEANORS ARE PROTECTIVE ORDERS. THAT WERE INVESTIGATED BY OUR DEPARTMENTS -- JUST AS AN EXAMPLE DURING. TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE CAMERA POLICE DEPARTMENT -- WHICH IS STAFFED BY DEPUTY SHERIFFS SO WITH THE VENTURA COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE. INVESTIGATED INCIDENTS THE RESULT OF A SEIZURE OF OVER EIGHTY FIVE FIREARMS AND THOUSANDS OF ROUNDS OF AMMUNITIONS. DURING THE COURSE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT RELATED INVESTIGATIONS. WERE WERE VERY GOOD AT HANDLING INVESTIGATIONS OF THE SORT OF THE LOCAL LEVEL. LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IS READY TO STEP UP AND PLAY A LARGER ROLE. IN RECOVERING FIREARMS IN THE APPS PROGRAM. AND I ENCOURAGE YOUR SUPPORT OF AB. TWELVE THANK YOU ARE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING AGAIN ELIZABETH ESPINOSA HERE ON BEHALF OF THE VENTURE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND SUPPORT AS WELL AS THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND SANTA CRUZ COUNTY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. AND I'LL MAKE A MOTION WITH THE BILL. RT ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THE VERY HARD FOR ME SO I JUST REPEAT WHAT I WHAT I SAID BEFORE WHAT I SAID BEFORE SO I I WANNA THINK OTHERS OFFICE WORKING WITH US WE HAVE DISCUSSIONS ON THE BUDGET ITEM AS WELL SO I THINK WE'LL PROBABLY BE FINE. AND YES I DO -- REPEAT MY ENQUIRING AS TO WHY SENATE PUBLIC SPEAKING SIMPLY PUBLIC SAFETY CONTINUE TO MEET AT THE EXACT SAME TIME EVERY. EVERY TUESDAY CELL I KNOW A LOT OF US ARE THINKING. THANK YOU I CONCUR WITH HIS COMMENTS. KATHY LENDS REPRESENT THE NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION OUTDOOR SPORTSMAN'S COLLISION CALIFORNIA SPORTSMEN'S LOBBY AND SPARKLING INTERNATIONAL APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S COMMENTS WE DON'T AGAIN OPPOSE THE CONCEPT HERE WE HAVE. THE APP PROGRAM HAS BEEN A FESTERING PROBLEM AND I'M IN THE CAPITAL FOR A LONG TIME WE ALL SUPPORT. RESOLVING THE ISSUES THERE WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FUNDING MECHANISM IS NOT THE DEALER RECORD OF SALE -- FROM LEGITIMATE FIREARMS PURCHASES THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OTHER ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN. SUPPORT OR TWEENER STORE. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS YES THIS WORKS JUST ONE QUESTION JUST FOR CLARIFICATION SO FOR THIS PILOT PROGRAM -- THIS WOULD AUGMENT OR BE IN ADDITION TO THE DOJ'S PROGRAM DOJ'S PROGRAM CRACKED AND ENDS AND NOT INSTEAD OF BUT IN ADDITION. TO A CONCLUSION. THANK YOU DID YOU. SO I HAVE A QUESTION. WHY ARE WE NOT JUST HOLDING DOJ ACCOUNTABLE FOR DOING THEIR JOB -- AS OPPOSED. TO COMING UP WITH ANOTHER PROGRAM THAT IN MY MIND KIND OF IS AN END RUN AROUND -- SEARCH WARRANTS AND GIVES -- DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHERRY PICK HOW THEY WANTED TO END RUNS AROUND SEARCH WARRANTS. OF I THINK THERE'S BEEN THERE HAVE BEEN EFFORTS OVER THE YEAR TO HOLD -- DOJ MORE ACCOUNTABLE TO THEIR NUMBERS AND WE THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL JUST AUGMENT WHAT THEY'RE DOING SO THAT WE CAN REALLY START TO MAKE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT TO ON REDUCING THE INVENTORY SO. AND AS FAR AS AND AND ROUND AND ROUND SEARCH WARRANTS I'M I'M NOT SURE -- WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT -- WELL OKAY SO WHAT I MEAN IS -- THEY'RE SORT OF ALREADY OPPORTUNITIES. FOR THIS TO HAPPEN DOJ HAS A PROGRAM I HEAR YOUR CONCERNS AND YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT IT NOT HAPPENING FAST ENOUGH SO. RATHER THAN SORT OF CREATE SOMETHING ELSE. THAT YOU ALSO HAVE TO MONITOR -- THAT ALSO COMES WITH COMPLICATIONS -- WHY NOT HOLD THE FOLKS THAT ARE ACCOUNTABLE -- THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOING THIS JOB -- ACCOUNTABLE HAVE THEM COME DOWN AND TALK ABOUT WHY THEY'RE NOT MOVING AS QUICKLY AS FOLKS WOULD LIKE YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY YOU ARE EMPOWERING AND FUNDING. SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS AND I DON'T KNOW HOW WE'RE DECIDING WHICH ONES WILL BE SELECTED BUT YOU'RE EMPOWERING THEM TO ALSO GO IN AND AND DO THIS KIND OF WORK WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING -- THERE IS WHEN WE GET IT RIGHT -- THAT SINCE. TWENTY SEVENTEEN YOU KNOW THERE HAS BEEN IN PLACE A PROHIBITED PERSONS FIREARMS RELINQUISHMENT FORM THAT HAS TO GET FILLED OUT AT THE END OF ANY CASE IF YOU DON'T YOU'RE IN VIOLATION AND THERE IS FOLLOW UP AND MONITORING THEY READ TAKE FIRE ARMS IMMEDIATELY -- UPON CONCLUSION OF THESE CASES SO THEN TO SAY HEY WHY DON'T WE FUND AND EMPOWER CERTAIN DEPARTMENTS WHO MAY BE OPERATING WITH INTEGRITY OR NOT TO KIND OF CHERRY PICK HOW THEY'RE GOING TO GO BACK -- YOU KNOW IN CERTAIN CASES OPEN THEM UP FOLLOW CERTAIN PEOPLE -- TOO BAD YOU KNOW DO WHATEVER THEY'RE GOING TO DO JUST KIND OF CONCERNS ME AND THE REASON WHY SHARED IS BECAUSE THERE WAS AN INSTANCE WHERE -- A GENTLE MAN -- IT WAS LISTED ON THE POLICE REPORT THAT HIS FIREARMS HAD BEEN TAKEN. PROBATION THROUGH SOME PAPERWORK ERROR. HAD IT LISTED THAT THEY WEREN'T. HIS RIGHTS ARE VIOLATED. BUSTED DOWN HIS DOOR. JACK HIM UP [inaudible] CHARGED HIM. AND ONCE ITWAS ALL REVEAL BECAUSE OF DUE PROCESS THEY REALIZE. HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY GUNS AND IN FACT THERE WAS A PAPERWORK ERROR. SO. WE'RE SORT OF EMPOWERING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE KINDS OF INSTANCES TO CONTINUE TO OCCUR -- WITH POPULATIONS THAT ARE ALREADY OVER POLICE DEALING WITH OVER COMPLIANCE AND AN OVER PUNISHMENT SO WHY DON'T WE JUST. HOLD THE PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE THAT WE HAVE ALREADY FUNDED TO DO THE JOB THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO UGH. TODAY YES THE FUNDING HAS THE EVERY YEAR THERE HAS BEEN A REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING OF THE AYE. PERHAPS SURE OF A YOU CAN COMMENT ON THIS BUT FOR US WE THINK IT CAN BE -- IT WOULD BE MORE EFFICIENT. OBVIOUSLY IF THERE'S A MISTAKE WITH THE DATABASE THAT'S A WHOLE NOTHER PROBLEM WE THINK THAT IT COULD POSSIBLY BE MORE EFFICIENT I HAVE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. WHO KNOWS THE LOCAL COMMUNITY BE ABLE TO WORK ON THE LIST OF THOSE PROHIBITED POSSESSORS AND ON THAT LIST THERE I MEAN THERE'S A THERE'S A STANDARD FOR WHO IS ON THE LIST? AND SO THIS GIVES LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT THE OPPORTUNITY. TO USE THE INTELLIGENCE THEY ALREADY HAVE TO WORK ON ON THE LIST IF THE LIST IS INCORRECT. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO KNOW TO SO THESE THE THIS WOULD BE A PILOT PROGRAMS AND THREE DIFFERENT COUNTIES -- WHERE THE SHERIFFS HAVE ALREADY AGREED AND THAT WOULD BE VERY CAREFUL DATA TAKEN SAYS TO TO SEE IF THERE IS A MODEL THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO AUGMENT WHAT THE DOJ IS DOING? AND THE IDEA THAT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HELPS THE DOJ IS NOT. UNIQUE THIS TIME THE DOJ WAS GIVEN FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. I THINK IT WAS THREE YEARS AGO -- TO HAVE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AUGMENTS THE WORK THEY'RE DOING AND THAT MEN MONEY ENDED UP BEING ON SPENT AND CAME RIGHT BACK INTO THE GENERAL FUND SO SAID. THIS WAY WE WILL GET GOOD STATISTICS. AND WE'LL SEE HOW ACCURATE THE DATABASES THAT THE DOJ IS OF MAINTAINING. YOU KNOW. I'M SORRY. BUT THAT KILLER IN YOUR DISTRICT WHO MURDERED THOSE PEOPLE. HE WAS NOT ON THE LIST. HE HAD FAMILY MEMBERS OR FRIENDS WHO. YOU KNOW MAYBE I DON'T KNOW HAD SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT HIS MENTAL HEALTH AND HIS BEHAVIOR. BUT NOBODY WENT AND GOT AT G. B. R. O. WHICH WAS ALREADY ON THE BOOKS BECAUSE MAYBE HE DIDN'T LOOK DANGEROUS ENOUGH FOR THEY DON'T WANT US NATURE. IT CAN HAPPEN IN MY FAMILY OR HE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A DANGEROUS PERSON HE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THE PERSON WHO WOULD BE CAPABLE OF DOING THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. YOU KNOW THAT'S BIAS WHICH IS INHERENT IN SO MANY OF THESE CONVERSATIONS THAT WERE HAPPENING THAT WE'RE HAVING RIGHT NOW. BUT THAT PERSON WOULDN'T EVEN BE IN THIS LIST FOR SOMEONE -- TO CHECK UP ON AND HE'S A VERY GUY THAT DID THOSE ATROCIOUS ACTS. THIS ISN'T GOING TO GET HIM. WHY DON'T WANT TO GET INTO WHETHER BILL SO WHAT YOUR QUESTION WAS COME ALIVE AND HAVING A MOMENT MY BUT MY QUESTION WAS THE SAME ABOUT FUNDING ABOUT HOW THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS ARE PACKED? YOU KNOW THERE BEEN CONVERSATIONS AND ARTICLES IN THE NEWS ACROSS THE STATE ABOUT CERTAIN SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE OPERATING WITH INTEGRITY AND THAT ARE NOT. IS THAT TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION WITH REGARD TO THIS BILL. SO YOU CAN ADDRESS THAT IN YOUR CLOSER ANYONE ELSE WITH ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AND YOU CAN ADDRESSED AS YOUR CLOTHES [inaudible] OF DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THAT WOULD LIKE. TO HAVE ANY FINISHING CLOSING STATEMENTS. WELL JUST JUST TO COMMENT ON ON THIS FAMILY MEMBERS -- REMARKS REGARDING -- YOU SERVING THE SEARCH FOR PROCESS THIS THIS THIS DOES NOT IN ANY WAY CHANGE THE RULES OF SEARCH AND SEIZURE THAT ARE ALREADY IN PLACE. IN THE STATE -- IS SIMPLY A REDIRECT THE TASKING OF FULFILLMENT OF THE APPS LIST TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IS PILOT PROJECT IS. TO TO SEE IF IT'S MORE EFFECTIVE THAN AND I WERE ABLE TO KEEP GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF PEOPLE THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE THEM. OKAY THANK YOU. DID YOU WANNA ADD UP I I JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR DRIVE A THANK YOU -- SO I'VE SO HERE'S HERE'S THE CHAIRS DILEMMA -- I BELIEVE WE NEED TO GIVE MORE. RESOURCES TO LOCAL. GOVERNMENT SO THAT THEY CAN AID DOJ IN ELIMINATING PEOPLE ARE PROHIBITED -- BLESSED OF WHICH DURING THE BUDGET PROCESS I WILL BE TALKING SO I DO SIT ON SUB FIVE SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THAT. WITH WITH DOCTOR WEBER -- COMMITTEE BUT ALSO -- I ALSO BELIEVE SOMEBODY NEEDS TO BE IN CHARGE AND I THINK PART OF THE CONCERN IS. DOJ IS SUPPOSED TO BE IN CHARGE WE WE NEED TO MAKE THEM ACCOUNTABLE. WE HAVE A NEW COLLECTED THAT HE WENT TO OUR COMMITTEE WE JUST APPOINTED A JUST GOT REELECTED A NEW -- ATTORNEY GENERAL SO HE'S ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES SO YOU CAN GET THE JOB DONE WE NEED. TO GET ON THEIR WITH. HE NEEDS TO HE NEEDS TO DO IS ON PLAN ON HOW TO GET THIS DONE -- SO FOR ME IT WAS A COORDINATED EFFORT IF WE COULD WITH THE DOJ AT THE HEALTH. BECAUSE I NEED TO BLAME SOMEBODY IF IT DOESN'T WORK I CAN'T. I DON'T WANT TO COME BACK AND I'M BLATANT ABOUT PUTTING YOU ON GLASS BUT ONLY DOUBLE AFTER YOU CHIEF AND THEN THERE'S TWO OTHER PROGRAMS AND THEY FAIL. FUNDS TO A GOOD ONE FAILS AND NOBODY. IS TAKING THE BLAME FOR IT WE'RE STILL POINT BEING. AT THE END OF THE DAY -- AND I'VE SPOKEN TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT -- THIS IS AN ISSUE HE HAS -- TO ULTIMATELY A FIX AND ALSO DON'T AND THAT'S WHY THIS IS IN POLICY COMMITTEE RIGHT NOW NOT MOSTLY IN. IS WHETHER NOT WE WANT TO TAKE SOME OF THIS. RESPONSIBILITY AWAY FROM HIM AND ALMOST GIVE IT TO THE LOCALS. AND SO -- THAT'S WHY COULDN'T WE WERE STILL KIND OF DEVELOPING IT. AND I KNOW YOU AND I WAS ARE WE JUST WE DISAGREE. KINDA DISAGREE BUT WE HAD TWO DIFFERENT CONCEPT OF HOW THIS SHOULD BE DONE -- IF THIS YOU FAIL I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU REVISIT IT IN THE PUBLIC SAFETY BUDGET COMMITTEE. AND WITH THE PROVISO THAT WE MAKE. D. O. J. D. ATTORNEY GENERAL -- RESPONSIBLE FOR BUT MOST IMPORTANT WE HAVE SOMEBODY THAT'S DOING IT LEAD. TO MAYBE EVEN GIVE OUT THE GRANT. SO THAT -- WE MAKE SURE THEY GET DONE SO THE QUESTION IS THAT THE CONSUMERS WERE ASKING CAN BE RESOLVED IN THAT BECAUSE WE CAN'T RESOLVE IT. I DON'T THINK WE RESULT RIGHT NOW. SO.

SIX FORTY FIVE AB SIX FOUR FIVE REQUIRES POSTING OF THE NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION LIFELINE ON EXISTING LABELS ON GUN PACKAGING ON THE FIREARM SAFETY CERTIFICATION EXAM AND ON NEW SIGNS AND GUN SHOPS. THERE'S BEEN A STARTLING INCREASE OF FIREARMS SUICIDES IN CALIFORNIA AND CURRENTLY THERE'S NO MANDATE IN MANDATED INFORMATION ON SUICIDE PREVENTION RESOURCES. AT ANY POINT DURING THE PROCESS OF OBTAINING A FIREARM. THIS CAP WAS HIGHLIGHTED TO ME BY A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER IN VENTURA COUNTY WHO WAS A VETERAN. WHO HAD LOST HIS OWN BROTHER A VETERAN TO A FIREARM SUICIDE? AND I'M PROUD TO BE OFFERING HIS LEGISLATIVE IDEA IT IS MY HOPE THAT AB SIX FOUR FIVE WILL REDUCE FIREARM SUICIDE BY PROVIDING GREATER ACCESS. TO VALUABLE INFORMATION THAT CAN ASSIST AN INDIVIDUAL IN TIME OF CRISIS. I MOVE THE BILL MR I GUESS. ANY OF THE WITNESSES ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS BETSEY ARMSTRONG ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA'S LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN STRONG SUPPORT.

GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT CAPULETS REPRESENTING THE NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION I'M HERE AND I'M NOT REALLY OPPOSITION I CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE SPIRIT OF THE GOAL BUT MAYBE TO OFFER -- ANOTHER CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TO APPROACH THIS THE NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION REPRESENTS THE FIREARMS RETAILERS DISTRIBUTOR MANUFACTURERS AND SPORTSMAN. AND FIREARMS USERS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. WE HAVE -- BEEN AND EMBARKED UPON A PROGRAM WHICH IS BEING HANDED OUT TO YOU RIGHT NOW WITH THE AMERICAN FOUNDATION FOR SUICIDE PREVENTION -- THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THIS COMMITTEE SPENT TALKING A LOT ABOUT ON I'M A VARIETY OF TALK TOPICS IN. A TRAINING AT PROVIDES ONLINE VIDEOS IT PROVIDES POSTERS FLYERS FOR CUSTOMERS COUNTER TOPS -- DECALS AND WE WERE HERE WHEN THE BAKER BILL THE ANALYSIS IS VERY THOROUGH WITH THE HISTORY -- AB FIFTEEN TWENTY FIVE WHICH BY THE WAY JUST WENT INTO EFFECT IN JANUARY SO ALL THE WARNING LABELS ALL THE POSTINGS JUST WENT INTO EFFECT THIS YEAR I THINK THE BAKER BILL ADDED. THE NUMBER. NINE ON THE LIST OF THINGS THAT NEED TO BE CONSIDERED THIS. CREATES NUMBER TEN AND I THINK WE ALL KNOW WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS ON A NUMBER OF SUBJECTS WHETHER IT'S PROP SIXTY FIVE OR WHATEVER -- POSTING YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT YOU REACH A POINT OF SATURATION WHERE IN NO LONGER IS EFFECTIVE IN SUICIDES JUST REALLY TO IMPORTANT PORT TO GET BURIED IN A WARNING LABEL IN A BOX. THAT NOBODY IS GOING TO READ AND YOU ALSO HAVE ALL THE BUSINESS IMPACTS WITH THE YEAR JUST NOW HAD ALL THAT CHANGED OUT THE FIRST OF THIS YEAR. AND NOW THIS WOULD GO INTO EFFECT NEXT YEAR -- IN JUNE AND SO YOU'RE REALLY DISRUPTING THE STREAM OF COMMERCE AND IT REALLY DOESN'T PRODUCE A GOOD RESULTS SO WE CERTAINLY WANT TO SUPPORT WHAT THE AUTHOR IS TRYING TO DO AND WE'D CERTAINLY LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR. AND MAY BE IN BED AND EXPAND SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE OUT THERE WORKING WITH NATIONAL SUICIDE GROUPS AND THE INDUSTRY SELF. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS MR QUIRK. YES -- I SHARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT THE OPPOSITION HAS. BOB WE'VE ALL GONE THROUGH SIGNING OFF ON A MORTGAGE I'VE NEVER BOUGHT A GUN SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE BUT I CAN HELP YOU WITH THAT [inaudible] NO. THEY'RE TOO DANGEROUS TO HAVE IN THE HOUSEHOLD THAT I THINK IS VERY TRUE THERE WILL BE NO SUICIDE IN MY HOUSE. BECAUSE I WILL NOT BUY A GUN. SO. I FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THAT I THINK HOUSES IF YOU HAVE A GUN IN THE HOUSE IT'S MUCH MORE LIKELY. THAT A FAMILY MEMBERS GOING TO GET KILLED THE NEW USE IT FOR DEFENSE. SO I'M SORRY YOU WILL NOT BE HELPING ME. ON THE OTHER HAND. HAVING GONE THROUGH A MORTGAGE AND YOU KNOW. A HUNDRED DIFFERENT PAGES I'M JUST A LITTLE CONCERNED -- THEY'RE ALREADY WARNINGS WHY ARE THEY ADEQUATE NOW. AND WITH THAT I'M I'M NOT SURE IF IT WAS IN THE ANALYSIS WE TOOK AN AMENDMENT THAT WAS SUGGESTED BY THE AMERICAN FOUNDATION. FOR SUICIDE PREVENTION TO THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE ITEM TEN ON A LIST THIS IS GOING TO BE A SEPARATE SIGN. THAT GIVES THE THE NAME OF THAT GIVES A NUMBER FOR THE SUICIDE PREVENTION HOTLINE. AND AGAIN IN THE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE VETERAN THAT I SPOKE TO AND ALL ALL THE ALSO GIVE THE STUDENTS NICK THAT. THAT FOR VETERANS 69% OF THE VETERAN SUICIDES ARE WITH A FIREARM. OF THE VETERAN THAT I SPOKE TO SAID RIGHT IN THAT MOMENT OF NEED WHEN THEY THAT WAS ALL HE WANTED WAS A NUMBER. OF SOMEBODY THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO COUNSEL THEM THROUGH THAT CRISIS SO WE THINK THAT. LOOKING AT THOSE THREE DIFFERENT POINTS A SIGN OF A SIGN ON THE WALL. A THE SIGN WHEN YOU TAKE THE THE GUN EXAM AND OF THE THE SIGN ON THE GUN PACKAGING THAT THOSE JUST IT JUST. OPPORTUNITY. FOR SOMEBODY THAT IS CONTEMPLATING. SUICIDE TO HAVE A NUMBER THAT THEY CAN REACH OUT TO YOU MADE A GOOD CASE SOME OF THE BILL. THE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

SIMILAR THE T. VISA ALLOWS ELIGIBLE VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING TO TEMPORARILY REMAIN IN THE AND WORK IN THE US. IN RECENT YEARS CALIFORNIA HAS ENACTED LEGISLATION TO ENSURE YOU VISA AND TV'S APPLICANTS HAVE RECEIVED CERTIFICATION FROM LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IN A TIMELY MANNER FOR THOSE. IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS. AND FOR THOSE IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS IN AN EXPEDITED MANNER. NONETHELESS MANY IMMIGRATION PRACTITIONERS AND DEPORTATION DEFENSE HAVE EXPRESSED THE NEED TO CREATE A CERTIFICATION PROCESS THAT IS PARALLEL TO THAT OF THE CURRENT IMMIGRATION COURT SYSTEMS TO FURTHER PROTECT VICTIMS. THIS BILL. SIMPLY REQUIRES A CERTIFYING END ENTITY TO PROCESS VICTIM CERTIFICATION FOR PURPOSES OF OBTAINING A YOU THESE ARE TO VISA. TO DO IT WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF THE REQUEST RATHER THAN.

TO SIGN THESE CERTIFICATIONS AND REQUIRES THAT THERE'S A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION THAT A VICTIM IS COOPERATING. UNTIL THEY'RE NOT COOPERATING -- IF THE NOTION OF THE VISA IS DEPENDENT ON COOPERATION WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AN ENTITY THAT'S BEING ASKED TO CERTIFY COOPERATION. SHOULD HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE THAT DECISION NOT THAT'S ALREADY EXISTING LAW BUT THIS BILL ADDS ADDITIONAL PEOPLE WHO CAN REQUEST. THIS NOTION OF SIGNING THE CERTIFICATION WHICH IS AN INFECTED DEMAND UNLESS THE PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICIAL CAN SHOW THAT THE PERSON IS NOT COOPERATING IF THE NOTION IS THAT THE ENTITY IS GIVEN THAT. AUTHORITY TO DECIDE AND THEY SHOULD HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DECIDE. THE BILL FURTHER TAKES THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS OUT OF THE HANDS OF THE CERTIFYING ENTITIES CREATES TIME AND RESOURCE ISSUES.

WHO WITH HIS WIFE LOFTS AN INFANT? AND AT THAT TIME OF SIDS WAS UNKNOWN. IT WAS SEVERAL RECOGNIZE UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW AND MUCH LATER ACTUALLY RECOGNIZED BY THE CDC SO. THE FACT IS AS TIME GOES ON WE IDENTIFY A PHENOMENON THAT WE CAN PUT A LABEL ON THIS IS ALREADY HAS A LABEL ON IT. I THINK IT'S A GOOD BILL I HAVE -- SONYA WINCHELL WHO LOST HER SON. TO BRIEFLY TESTIFY BUT SHE'S BEEN A PART OF THIS CONVERSATION FOR SEVERAL YEARS -- SOON. THANK YOU THANK YOU COMMITTEE. I'M GONNA READ BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN REALLY NOT BE FAST. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT MY FIRST BORN SON NICO WINCHELL AND SUDDEN UNEXPLAINED DEATH IN CHILDHOOD OTHERWISE KNOWN AS S. UTC. SUNDAY OCTOBER TWENTY FIRST TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE JUST ANOTHER DAY FOR ANY CO. A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD SOPHOMORE REAL AMERICANA HIGH SCHOOL AND DEVOTED JAZZ GUITARIST WITH THE NATIONALLY ACCLAIMED HIGH SCHOOL JAZZ BAND. HE SPENT THE NIGHT BEFORE AT ONE OF THE MANY ON GOING FALL BAND FUNDRAISING PARTIES. AND SUNDAY MORNING HE WAS TO VOLUNTEER AT AT A CAR WASH. NICO NEVER MADE IT BECAUSE SOMETIME BETWEEN FOUR AND FIVE AM HE DIED IN HIS SLEEP. INSTEAD OF A JOYOUS DAY HELPING THIS BAND COMMUNITY OUR HOME BECAME A CRIME SCENE. WITH FIRST RESPONDERS INVESTIGATING AND QUESTIONING OUR FAMILY. THE CHAPLAIN TO RIDE WITHOUT ANY HELPFUL ADVICE EXCEPT TO DRINK WATER. THE CORNER REMOVED HIS COLD PURPLE TINGE BODY WHILE HIS FATHER. HIS TWELVE YEAR OLD BROTHER. AND MYSELF SAT SHOCKED IN NUMBING SILENCE. WE WERE LEFT WITH NOIDEA AS TO HOW TO HOW HAPPY HEALTHY SIX FOOT TALL TEENAGER JUST DIED IN HIS SLEEP EIGHT DAYS BEFORE HIS SIXTEENTH BIRTHDAY. THIS ONLY HAPPENS TO INFANTS WE ARE TOLD. WE HAVE NO FAMILY HISTORY OF BREAST YOU DC OR HAD EVEN HEARD OF IT WE WERE COMPLETELY UNAWARE OF HOW TO PROCEED. THANKFULLY A FRIEND WAS A FORENSIC PATHOLOGIST CALLED AND INFORMED US ABOUT S. UTC. HE TOLD US AT THE CORNER DOES NOT HARVEST DNA RICH TO ISSUE AND THAT WE NEED IT FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION. NONE OF THIS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FORMATION CAME FOR FIRST RESPONDERS. CALIFORNIA MOST FAMILIES WHO ARE VICTIMS OF ISSUE DC ARE LEFT WITHOUT ANY ABILITY TO FURTHER THE INVESTIGATION INTO THEIR BELOVED CHILD'S DEATH. THERE IS AN INCREDIBLY SHORT TIME PERIOD TO COLLECT IMPORTANT DATA FOR S. UT RESEARCH. BECAUSE OUR FRIEND INTERVENES WE CONTACTED THE CORNER IN TIME FOR TISSUE AND ORGAN RETENTION AND WE'RE WE WERE ABLE TO SUPPLY S. UT RESEARCHERS AT BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL FOR RESEARCH. MOST FAMILIES BERRIER CREMATE THIS INFORMATION WITH YOUR CHILD AND ARE LEFT TO LIVE THEIR LIVES NEVER KNOWING HOW OR WHY THEY'RE HEALTHY CHILD DIED. WHAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE SOME CLUES AS TO WHAT KILLED OUR SON THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUES THROUGH THE RESEARCH TEAM? NEW. HOLD UP THE PICTURE AND SHARE A SURELY GO WITH THEM -- AND IF YOU CAN SEE FROM HERE THIS IS NICK -- EIGHT DAYS BEFORE HE PASSED HE WAS DOWNTOWN AT SEVENTEENTH AND I ST A SECOND SATURDAY WITH HIS JAZZ BAND PERFORMING -- WITH THIS COMBO THANKS SO THANK YOU MISTER COOPER. WE HAVE A MOTION MEMBERS COOPER FOOD JUST VERY BRIEFLY GARY COOPER TWO THINGS ONE I AM A NEIGHBOR OF THE WIND CHILLS AND WE WERE THERE THE DAY THAT MAKE UP PASSED AWAY IT WAS A VERY TRAGIC SITUATION AND THAT'S WHY I'VE WORKED WITH -- MISTER COOLEY.

UTC THE BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL IN SUPPORT SO I STRONGLY RECOMMEND. PASSAGE OF A. B.. SIX TWENTY THANK YOU. BUT ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION JUST GOT. IS A TURN MEMBERS COURSE ALSO ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION ALSO HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE CORNERS ASSOCIATION RESPECTFULLY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL I'M VERY SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS MA'AM -- UNFORTUNATELY -- DEATHS OCCUR IN CHILDHOOD DEATHS ALWAYS RECEIVE CAREFUL SCRUTINY -- AND ARE OFTEN THE HIGHEST PRIORITY OF A CORNER'S OFFICE -- THE SHARES ARE CONCERNED HERE BECAUSE FORTY NINE OF THE FIFTY COUNTY SHERIFF'S ALSO SERVICE THE ELECTED COUNTY CORNER -- ANY TIME THE CAUSE OF DEATH IS NOT READILY APPARENT A SERIOUS INVESTIGATION IS UNDERTAKEN AND THAT HAPPENS IRRESPECTIVE OF THE AGE OF THE DECEDENT -- S. U. DC. IS CLASSIFICATION OF S. U. D. C. LACKS HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE WHAT WITHOUT ANY DISRESPECT ANY -- DECEIVING OR FAMILY -- BUT THERE THERE THERE HAS NOT BEEN SCIENTIFIC VETTING -- IS -- HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE TO THIS NOTION OF A SYNDROME OF S. U. DC -- SIDS HAS GAINED IN TIME BUT THERE WERE QUESTIONS SIMILAR TO SIDS AND AGAIN THIS IS A MUCH BROADER CATEGORY OF DEATHS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. CHILD WHO DIES BETWEEN THE AGES OF ONE EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE -- CHILDHOOD DEATHS WHEN THE CAUSES UNDETERMINED ARE NOT HOMOGENEOUS IN NATURE -- WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT CREATING THIS NOTION. THAT THAT ANY DEATH OF AN UNDETERMINED CAUSE -- OF A CHILD BETWEEN THE AGES OF ONE EIGHTEEN GET INAPPROPRIATELY GROUP TOGETHER AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS WERE OPPOSED TO THE BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- ARE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. QUESTION FROM MISTER QUIRK YES JUST IN RESPONSE TO THE SHERIFF'S. I'VE GOT THE BILL IN FRONT OF ME IT'S VERY SIMPLE IT SIMPLY SAYS. OUR SUDDEN UNEXPLAINED DEATH IN CHILDHOOD IT'S NOT CAPITALIZED IT'S NOT TO ME INDICATING THE SYNDROME. IT'S JUST SAYING IF THERE'S A SUDDEN DEATH BETWEEN ONE AND EIGHT EIGHTEEN YEARS -- YOU'LL TAKE A TISSUE SAMPLE WHICH COULD BE USEFUL AS HE SAID FOR DNA SO I I THINK THIS IS TOTALLY APPROPRIATE. HAS BEEN MOVED. YEAH I HAVE AS YOU MOVE TO WORK THANK YOU RIVERSIDE MOTION THANK YOU I HEARD IT IT'S GREAT BILL I TAKE IT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS OKAY YOU MAY CLOSE I THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT THE NATIONAL CORNERS ASSOCIATION SUPPORTS THIS CLASSIFICATION. AND ADVISED PEOPLE OF THE TISSUE SAMPLE SO I THINK FROM A NATIONAL PERSPECTIVE. IT IS UNDERSTOOD. IT'S NOT CLASSIFIED AS A SYNDROME. AND I THINK THE POINT WAS SIDS IS SAID WAS IDENTIFIED IN THIS LEGISLATURE PASSED LAWS TO DEAL WITH THE TOPIC. BEFORE CDC ACTUALLY RECOGNIZE IT -- SO I THINK. IT'S A VERY APPROPRIATE SPOTLIGHT AND YOU'RE ONLY DEALING WITH THOSE SITUATIONS WERE IS FRANKLY A SOURCE OF CONSTERNATION. TO THE DEATH PROFESSIONALS THEY CANNOT FATHOM WHY THIS CHILD DIED. AND I THINK ENACT FACT PATTERN TO OFFER FAMILIES A PATH. TO FOR UNDERSTANDING AND SAFEGUARDING. IT IS JUST SENSIBLE QUESTIONABLE. THANK YOU MINUTE AT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT THANK YOU FOR COMING IN AND SHARING YOUR STORY AND BRING IN A PICTURE OF YOUR OF YOUR SON -- AND I KNOW THAT WITH. EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO DO THAT OF YOU KNOW I I AND ONE OF THE AGED THAT REMEMBERS -- WHEN THEY COULD EXPLAIN -- EIGHT IN RESEARCH AND AND WERE NOW. HAVING DISCUSSIONS ABOUT IT BEING CURED WITHIN OUR LIFETIME. AND WE'RE GETTING CLOSER CLOSER BUT I THINK THAT'S BECAUSE WE'RE TAKING TISSUE SAMPLE BECAUSE WE DO MORE RESEARCH BECAUSE WERE. WE DOING MORE TO FIND OUT HOW WE GET THERE AND SO. THAT'S WHY THE CHURCH RECOMMEND I BOTH SO THAT WE CAN. WE CANNOT FIGURE OUT DISMISSED REUS SO THANK YOU FOR BRING THE SPORT IS GROWING SEPARATION CALDERON. ON EIGHTY SIX TWENTY THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER AYE LACKEY AYE LACKEY AYE BAUER-KAHAN. DEEP [inaudible] KAMLAGER-DOVE. QUIRK AYE QUIRK AYE SANTIAGO. SANTIAGO I WICKS WICKS I THE MEASURE PASSES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER BERMAN. A. B.. FIVE THREE EIGHT ITEM NUMBER FIVE THE MOTION IS A SECOND SANTIAGO MOVE MISS WICKS SECOND. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU COLLEAGUES FOR THE QUICK MOTION AND SECOND -- WILL BE VERY BRIEF I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL. SB FIVE THIRTY EIGHT SIXTY IMPROVE THE AVAILABILITY EFFICIENCY AND QUALITY OF MEDICAL EVIDENCE YOUR EXAMINATIONS. FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVIVORS AFTER AND DURING SEXUAL ASSAULT TIMELY ACCESS TO TRAUMA INFORMED IN EVIDENCE BASED CARE CAN PREVENT ADVERSE HEALTH OUTCOMES. AND ALLOW FOR THE PROPER COLLECTION OF EVIDENCE UNFORTUNATELY DESPITE THEIR VALUE TO SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVIVORS AND PUBLIC SAFETY. ACCESS TO MEDICAL OF AN ENTRY EXAMINATIONS IS LIMITED CURRENTLY THERE ARE FORTY NINE SEXUAL ASSAULT FORENSIC EXAMINATION TEAM SERVING ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA. AND RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF EXAMINERS IS CHALLENGING -- AB FIVE THIRTY EIGHT ADDRESSES THESE I GOT MORE DETAILS BUT I'LL SAVE IT AND IN CASE THERE QUESTIONS BUT WANT -- TO GIVE THE EXPERTS A CHANCE. TO TO TO SPEAK WITH ME TODAY ARE KIM WALKER AND HILLARY LARKIN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SEXUAL ASSAULT FORENSIC EXAMINER'S ASSOCIATION THE SPONSOR OF THE BILL. IT IS BILL WAS ON CONSENT TO IT. WE RECEIVED SOME INFORMATION AT THE LAST MINUTE TO REASON. APPRECIATE THAT MR THANK YOU. THANK YOU MY NAME TELLER LARK AND I'M A PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE THIRTEEN AND ALAMEDA COUNTY -- I I JUST WANNA REMIND YOU WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR SIR TEAMS AND BY DEFINITION THAT'S A MEDICAL EXAMINER AN ADVOCATE AND A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO HELP US KEEP UP WITH TECHNOLOGY AND IMPROVE THAT -- QUALITY OF THE EXAM THAT WE CAN DELIVER AS MEDICAL EXAMINERS. AS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT -- WE'VE CREATED ELECT AN ELECTRONIC REPORTING FORM TO KEEP UP WITH THE ELECTRONIC REPORTING FORMS THAT ARE. ARE SORRY THE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS THAT ARE USED IN HOSPITALS EVERY DAY. SO IT ALLOWS US -- TO MOSTLY INTEGRATE INTO THE ELECTRONIC COMMENT ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD THE FORM ALSO IMPROVES PRIVACY AND SECURITY OF THIS VERY SENSITIVE DOCUMENT WELL CREATED AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE THE EXAM TECHNIQUES MONITOR QUALITY INCREASE ACCOUNTABILITY AND CREATE MORE TRANSPARENCY ACROSS MULTIPLE. DISCIPLINES. ACCESS TO START EXAMS -- ACROSS THE STATE IS AN ONGOING CHALLENGE AND WE NEED TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN MORE QUALIFIED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TO PERFORM THE EXAMS. THE BILL -- EXPANDS THE SCOPE OF THIS YOU SEE FM TO SEE TO NOT ONLY TRAIN AND SEXUAL ASSAULT BUT ALSO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE STRANGULATION AN ELDER ABUSE -- JUST FOR AN EXAMPLE SEXUAL ASSAULT DOES NOT HAPPEN IN ISOLATION SO 17% OF THE VICTIMS THAT WE SEE IN OUR PROGRAM AT HIGHLAND OR HAVE ALSO BEEN STRANGLED SO HAVING CROSS TRAINING AND STRANGULATION. IS VERY IMPORTANT. IN THE PAST LEGISLATIVE YEAR THERE BEEN INITIATIVES PROPOSED AND PASSED THE FOCUS RESOURCES ON THE TESTING OF SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE KID AND DNA ANALYSIS WE CANNOT FORGET THAT THOSE KIDS ARE BEING COLLECTED BY THE MEDICAL EXAMINERS. WHO ARE SEEN IN TREATING SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIMS AND THEIR QUEUE CRISIS THE SOONER THE VICTIMS CAN ACCESS TRAINED FORENSIC EXAMINERS? THE BETTER TRAINED EXPERIENCE IN SUPPORT OF THOSE EXAMINERS ARE THE BETTER THE QUALITY OF EVIDENCE. SO IF WE ARE GOING TO GET THE BEST RETURN ON INVESTMENT WE NEED TO SUPPORT BOTH THE MEDICAL EXAMINER'S THAT COLLECT THAT EVIDENCE AND THE CRIMINALIST WHO ANALYZE IT [inaudible] THANK YOU. THE MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS KEN WALKER AND THE PROGRAM COORDINATOR FOR THE SEXUAL ASSAULT FORENSIC EXAM TEAM IN CIVIC THAT SERVE SANTA CLARA SAN BENITO AND SANTA CRUZ COUNTIES. I'M ALSO IN THE LEADERSHIP BOARD OF CAL SAFE REPRESENTING THE FORTY NINE EXAM TEAMS. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY I'M A PRACTICING FORENSIC NURSE EXAMINER PROVIDING MEDICAL AND FRIENDS A CARE TO SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. SUCH AS UP FORENSIC EXAMINER'S PRIMARILY PERFORM A STANDARD MEDICAL FORENSIC EXAM FOR PATIENTS TO PRESENT AFTER REPORTING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. THIS INCLUDES PROVISION OF PATIENT RIGHTS MEDICAL CARE AND TREATMENT EVIDENCE COLLECTION AND SUPPORT. UNDER THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT HAVE THE RIGHT TO THE SAME MEDICAL FORENSIC EXAM. EVEN IF THEY CHOOSE NOT TO PURSUE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. THIS EXAM ALLOWS THE PATIENT CRITICAL TIME TO PROCESS THE AFTER EFFECTS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT BUT PRESERVES PERISHABLE EVIDENCE THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE LOST. EXAMS DONE UNDER BORROWER COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS ABBREVIATED EXAMS. INITIALLY IT WAS BELIEVED THAT THESE EXAMS WILL TAKE LESS TIME AND COST LESS TO COMPLETE. AFTER FOUR YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN THE FIELD IS BECOME APPARENT THAT NOTHING ABOUT THE EXAM IS ABBREVIATED. AND THERE'S NO REDUCTION IN THE COST OF PROVIDING THEM. EXAM TEAMS OF ESSENTIALLY ELIMINATED THE ABBREVIATED EXAMINE PROVIDED A STANDARD EXAM IS BEST PRACTICE. SINCE THE EXAM IS THE EXAM THERE SHOULD BE ONE RATE FOR REIMBURSEMENT. AND THAT SHOULD BE BASED ON LOCALLY NEGOTIATED RATE FOR ALL EXAMS. THERE SHOULD BE NO NEGOTIATE NO NEGOTIATION OF THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE BASED ON THE PATIENT'S DECISION TO ENGAGE OR PORT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. ENTRANCE EXAM TEAMS IN CALIFORNIA CANNOT SUSTAIN PROVIDING FULLY RESOURCE STANDARD EXAMS AT A LOWER RATE. IT WOULD JEOPARDIZE AVAILABILITY OF THE QUALIFIED HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS REDUCE PATIENT ACCESS TO EXAMS. AMONG ITS MANY GOALS AB FIVE THIRTY EIGHT SIX TO CLARIFY THE LANGUAGE ON OFFSETTING THE COST OF EXAMS TO FIND BY BALA. WHICH IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE VIABILITY OF EXAM TEAMS IN CALIFORNIA WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. NAME AN ORGANIZATION. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME STRIVE HARD AND I AM THE PRESIDENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FORENSIC NURSES SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CHAPTER. ON THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FRIENDS A NURSE YOUR NAME IN ORGANIZATIONS ALL RIGHT THANKS THANK YOU. NAME AN ORGANIZATION. HI MY NAME IS MICHELLE SHORES AND I AM IN SUPPORT OF AB FIVE THIRTY EIGHT THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION YES SIR. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE TODAY MY NAME IS JOHN FINLEY SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION AGAINST SEXUAL ASSAULT. AS THE STATE COALITION REPRESENTING EIGHTY FOUR RAPE CRISIS CENTER PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA ON THE CALIFORNIA COALITION AGAINST SEXUAL ASSAULT OPPOSES SB THIRTY AB FIVE THIRTY EIGHT IN ITS CURRENT FORM -- WE'RE TAKING A RESPECTFUL OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDMENT POSITION IF ENACTED THIS LEGISLATION WILL ULTIMATELY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON LOCAL SEXUAL SOLD SERVICES PROGRAMS RAPE CRISIS CENTERS AND THE SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE THAT THE SERVER. CAL COSTS IS STRONGLY OPPOSED TO THE PROVISION OF AB FIVE THIRTY EIGHT THAT ELIMINATES IN STATUTE THE EXISTING THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR REIMBURSEMENT CAP FOR AN ABBREVIATED ADULT ADOLESCENT SEXUAL ASSAULT AN EXAMINATION. FOR MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS AND HOSPITALS THAT PROVIDE THOSE EXAMS AND INSTEAD ALLOWS IT TO BE SET BY THE CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. CALL CASA OPPOSES USING VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT SERVICES TRAINING OFFICERS PROSECUTORS KNOWN AS STOP GRANTS TO FUND ANY INCREASED REIMBURSEMENT FOR FORENSIC EXAMINATIONS WHICH REMOVING THIS CAP AND STATUTE WOULD ULTIMATELY ALLOW. FOR IF THE REIMBURSEMENT CAP IS REMOVED AND THE FUNDING FOR REIMBURSING THESE EXAMS CONTINUES TO COME FROM ABOUT WAS STOP GRANTS THE RAPE CRISIS CENTER PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WOULD STAND TO LOSE VITAL FUNDING RESOURCES. TELL COSTS AND OTHER ENTITIES OPPOSE SIMILAR LEGISLATION IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THAT SOUGHT TO RAISE THE REIMBURSEMENT ABOUT AND OUR POSITION ON THIS MATTER IS NOT CHANGED. THE BILL ANALYSIS FOR THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS AT THAT TIME PROVIDED A SIMILAR POINT OF VIEW STATING CURRENTLY VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT FEDERAL FUNDS ARE FULLY COMMITTED AND IF THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE IS EVER INCREASED. LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WILL BE REIMBURSED AT THE EXPENSE OF ANOTHER PROGRAM. SOME AGENCIES CURRENTLY DO NOT PURSUE THE OCCASIONAL THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR REIMBURSEMENT BECAUSE IT IS NOT COST EFFECTIVE BUT THEY WOULD PURSUE A HIGHER LEVEL OF REIMBURSEMENT. CAL CASA BELIEVES THAT ELIMINATING THE STATUTORY CAP ON REIMBURSEMENTS EFFECTIVELY SERVE THE SAME PURPOSE AS RAISING IT AND AS A STRATEGY TO CALL CASA POSES TO SOLVING THIS PROBLEM. INSTEAD OF USING VAL WAS STOP GRANTS AS REIMBURSEMENT DOLLARS FOR THE ABBREVIATED SEXUAL ASSAULT EXAMS THE REIMBURSEMENT FUNDING SHOULD COME FROM THE CALIFORNIA VICTIM COMPENSATION BOARD. VICTIMS COMPENSATION CURRENTLY REIMBURSES THE COSTA FORENSIC EXAMS IN FORTY SIX OTHER STATES. CALVI CB ALSO REIMBURSES CERTAIN MEDICAL EXPENSES FOR VICTIMS OF CRIME AND CAL CASA BELIEVES THE CAL B. C. B. PROVIDES THE APPROPRIATE FUNDING STREAM TO REIMBURSE ABBREVIATED SEXUAL ASSAULT EXAMS WHICH ARE BY DEFINITION CRIME RELATED EXPENSES. WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT A SURVIVOR OF SEXUAL ABUSE SHOULD NEVER BE BILLED FOR A FORENSIC RAPE EXAM AND SIMILARLY A SURVIVOR'S WILLINGNESS TO COMPLY WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY INFLUENCE OR WHETHER IF WHETHER OR NOT A FORENSIC RAPE EXAM. IS REIMBURSABLE ALL SURVIVORS ARE ENTITLED BY LAW TO A FORENSIC RAPE EXAM REGARDLESS OF THE COMPLIANCE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT WHETHER DESIRE TO REPORT. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN CALIFORNIA RAPE CRISIS CENTERS PROVIDED SERVICES 435-000-60070 EIGHT SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT WITH NUMBERS CONTINUING TO INCREASE DUE TO EXPANDED AWARENESS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE. WE STAND UNITED WITH A MEMBER PROGRAMS IN URGING THAT THIS BILL BE REMAIN A BE AMENDED TO REMOVE THE PROVISION THAT ELIMINATES THE REIMBURSEMENT CAP AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO COMMIT OURSELVES TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. THE LEGISLATURE SPONSORS AND ANY RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM THAT DOES NOT TAKE AWAY FROM CRITICAL FUNDING RESOURCES FOR RAPE CRISIS CENTERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. YES GOOD MORNING I'M HERE TILL MALLEY ON THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF ALAMEDA COUNTY AND I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN. ISSUES AROUND SEXUAL SALT FOR A GOOD PART OF TWENTY YEARS. INCLUDING THE LOCK -- SPONSORING THE LAW THAT CREATED THE THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR FUNDING IS A STOP GAP MEASURE. FOR BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE EXAMS FIRST SURVIVORS WHO DID NOT WANT TO ENGAGE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND THEREFORE LAW ENFORCEMENT WOULD WERE NOT WAS NOT ON THE HOOK TO PAY FOR THE EXAM. I AGREE WITH CAL CLASSES POSITION AND I WANT TO SAY THAT I'M VERY THANKFUL FOR MY COLLEAGUES I WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH MS LARKIN. AT HALF THROUGH HIGHLAND HOSPITAL WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON START ISSUE SINCE. NINETEEN NINETY THREE AND HOW IT HIGHLIGHTS HOSPITALS ONE OF THE FIRST START CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA. SO I SUPPORT THE THE A FACT THAT FORENSIC EXAMS SHOULD BE FUNDED AND PAID FOR NOT BY THE VICTIM EVER. BUT BY OF VICTIMS OF CRIME FUNDING. THE FIRST PART OF A FRIEND'S EXAMS A MEDICAL EXAM TO MAKE SURE THAT THE VICTIM SURVIVOR IS HEALTHY AND THAT THEIR DAUGHTER ANY HEALTH ISSUES ARE ADDRESSED. PART OF THE EXAM ALSO INCLUDES STINGS LIKE STD SCREENING AND MORNING AFTER PILLS ANOTHER PROPHYLAXIS X. TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE HEALTHY FIRST. AND THE SECOND PART OF THAT EXAM IS A FORENSIC EXAM TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY FORENSIC EVIDENCE. AND SO FOR THAT PURPOSE BECAUSE THE PRIMARY EXAM. IS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SURVIVOR IS HEALTHY. AND THAT -- AND THERE IT'S A MEDICAL EXAM THAT IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR VICTIMS OF CRIME TO FUND THAT. VICTIMS OF CRIME PAY FOR PEOPLE'S MENTAL EXAMS. IN OTHER TYPES OF CRIMES VICTIMS OF CRIME FUNDING PAYS FOR RELOCATION AND MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING FOR OTHER VICTIMS OF CRIME AND THERE'S NO REASON WHY VICTIMS OF CRIME SHOULD NOT ALSO BE PAYING FOR THE MEDICAL FORENSIC EXAMS. THAT THE EXPERTS SUCH AS THE TWO SPEAKERS HERE A PROPONENTS OF THE BILL ARE ENGAGING IN. SO FOR THAT REASON I VERY VERY REGRETFULLY OPPOSE IT AND URGE THAT WE USE WE CHANGE OUR AMEND TO MAKE THE FUNDING COME FROM VICTIMS OF CRIME FUNDING. THANK YOU ARE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION.

THEIR FAITH THE ABILITY OR RACE WE ARE NOT EXEMPT TO PREJUDICE FIELD ACTIONS AND WORDS. THE STATE AUDITOR REPORT REVEALED THAT THREE OUT OF FOUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES REVIEWED FAILED TO PROPERLY IDENTIFY HATE CRIMES. WITHIN THESE FOUR AGENCIES THE STATE AUDITOR ALSO FOUND THAT NINETY SEVEN HATE CRIMES ROUGHLY AGENCIES A DENTED DIGNIFIED. WERE NOT REPORTED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT ONE OF THE AGENCIES REVIEWED COMMITTED THE VAST MAJORITY OF ERRORS. CURRENTLY STATE LAW DOES REFRESHER TRAINING OUTSIDE OF THE OFFICER TRAINING ACADEMY. THE SAME REPORT REVEALED THAT FEW LOCAL AGENCIES PROVIDE A REFRESHER TRAINING TO POLICE OFFICERS EVEN WHEN EVEN THEN THE TRAINING IT WAS OFFERED TO A MINORITY OF EMPLOYED OFFICERS. AB EIGHT THIRTY SEVEN ADDRESSES THIS PERVASIVE ISSUE BY REQUIRING THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES REQUIRE. PEACE OFFICERS TO COMPLETE REFRESHER TRAINING USING THE MOST RECENT TRAINING MATERIAL DEVELOP BY THE COMMISSION ON PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING POST. REQUIRED POST ESTABLISH STANDARDS FOR THE FREQUENCY OF THAT PERIODIC TRAINING ALONG LAW ENFORCEMENT AND TO MAKE THEIR HATE CRIME TRAINING CULTURALLY RELEVANT TO THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE.

GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL. NINE ZERO ONE WHICH SEEKS TO ORANGE ENCOURAGE. APPROPRIATE INTERVENTION FOR YOUTH WHO ARE AT RISK OPPOSED -- TO BEING FURTHER CRIMINALIZE. AND INVOLUNTARY PROBATION CURRENT LAW GIVES PROBATION DEPARTMENT THE BROAD AUTHORITY. TO SUPERVISE AND MIX CASES INCLUDING AT RISK YOU AS WELL AS YOU -- WITH MORE FORMAL PROBATION STATUS THE PROBLEM IS THAT 80% OF THE U. OR AN VOLUNTARY PROBATION WERE PLACED UNDER SUPERVISION BECAUSE OF POOR ATTENDANCE. GRADES BEHAVIOR OR OVERALL PERFORMANCE AT SCHOOL. THESE YOU ARE SUBJECT TO VOLUNTEER PROBATION ARE ESSENTIALLY CRIMINALIZED WITHOUT HAVING. EVEN GONE BEFORE A COURT HEARING. THESE YOUTH -- WHO ARE REQUIRED TO CHECK IN WITH A PROBATION OFFICER? SUBJECT TO RANDOM SEARCH CURFEW. SURPRISE HOME VISITS AS WELL AS THE INTERROGATION. DESPITE THE PROGRAM'S BEING LABELED VOLUNTARY PARENTS AND YOU OFTEN FEEL PRESSURED WITH IN THE PROGRAM AND DO NOT HAVE THE BENEFIT OF SPEAKING TO AN ATTORNEY. MORE OVER. BLACKS AND LATINOS CHILDREN ARE CONSISTENTLY OVER IDENTIFIED AS AT RISK. OF DELINQUENCIES AND REFERRED -- INFORMAL SUPERVISION A FACT FOUR POINT 3% OF THEM WERE REFERRED OF FOR GENERAL LACK OF MOTIVATION. AND ONLY TWO POINT 7% WERE REFERRED AS SUSPECT OF A SUSPICION OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE ONE POINT 5%. OF FOR ANGER ISSUES AND ONE POINT 5% FOR PARENTAL CONFLICT. AB NINE A ONE WOULD ENSURE THAT YOUTH RECEIVING APPROPRIATE INTERVENTION AND ARE NOT CRIMINALIZE FOR ACADEMIC REASONS. FOR TECHNICALLY -- FOR TO FOR FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS BEHAVIOR -- BY LIMITING PROBATION DEPARTMENTS OVER BROAD DISCRETION AS WELL AS ENSURING THE TRUANCY OR DISOBEYING A TEACHER ALONE IS NOT THE REASON FOR A CHILD TO BE SUBJECTED TO THE JUVENILE SYSTEM. EVERY YOU DESERVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO START TO FOR A BRIDE AS OF GROWING UP -- TO ADULTHOOD MY BILL INTENDS TO REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD FOR YOU ENDING UP IN JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEMS THEREFORE REDUCING THE LIKELIHOOD.

I'M SPEAKING TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB NINE A ONE WHICH SEEKS TO INCREASE DIVERSION OF YOUNG PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND TOWARDS COMMUNITY BASED INTERVENTIONS. THIS LEGISLATION IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TO ENDING THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE. UNDER CURRENT LAW PROBATION HAS AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE SERVICES. TO ANY MINOR IN THE STATE THAT STATE ASIDE IS AT RISK OF SUNDAY COMMITTING DELINQUENT BEHAVIOR. LED TO YOU THING REFER TO PROBATION FOR MINOR MISBEHAVIOR. FOR ACADEMIC ATTENDANT ISSUES. THIS RUNS COUNTER TO NUMEROUS STUDIES THAT DEMONSTRATE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT CONTACT WITH USE. WHO ARE LOW RISK SHOULD BE MINIMIZED BECAUSE IT IS AN EFFECTIVE AND INCREASES OUR RISK FOR COURT INVOLVEMENT IN FUTURE INCARCERATION? ADDITIONALLY. THIS BROAD SUBJECTIVE DISCUSSIONS LENDS ITSELF TO IMPLICIT AND EXPLICIT BIAS. AND PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IDENTIFIED AS AT RISK MY PROBATION. FOR EXAMPLE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY IN. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN BLACK AND LATINO STUDENTS WERE OVER 80% OF THE USE LABELED AT RISK IN SCHOOL BASS PROBATION SUPERVISION. DESPITE BEING ONLY APPROXIMATELY ABOUT 63% OF THE LA POPULATION. THIS BILL DOES NOT IMPACT OF PROBATION PROGRAMS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN COURT ORDERED SERVICES. AND WE SUPPORT PROVIDER VERSION.

THERE WERE OVER TWENTY ONE THOUSAND YOU I'M GOING TO A PROBATION. I AM NOT IN IN COLLEGE AND I STARTED TO BE A SOCIAL WORK. SO SHORT [inaudible] SOCIAL WORKER. YOU HAVE ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS -- MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS KATHY SURER OF FOR THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA ALSO PROUD TO BE A CO SPONSOR -- THE WE'VE SEEN THE ISSUES ADDRESSED IN AB -- NINE OH ONE THROUGH OR WORK IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY -- WHERE BETWEEN 200-015-2000 FIVE IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT PUT OVER THREE THOUSAND CHILDREN ON PROBATION CONTRACTS FOR NORMAL YOUTHFUL BEHAVIOR NOT CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR -- BASED ON THE BROADER THIRTY BASED -- GRANTED UNDER WELFARE INSTITUTIONS CODE SECTION -- SIX FIFTY FOUR YOUTH WERE PLACED ON PROBATION -- FOR REASONS THAT WERE CITED AS INCORRIGIBLE EDDIE OR DEFIANCE AND DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOR CITING TO SECTION SIX OH ONE IN ONE CASES STUDENT WAS PLACED ON PROBATION FOR BEHAVIOR RELATED TO GRIEF FROM THE DEATH OF A BABY SISTER -- THE YOUTH AND THEIR PARENTS ARE OFTEN TOLD IF THEY DON'T AGREE TO PROBATION THEIR CASES WILL BE REFERRED TO THE D.

BROKE TRICKLE PRINT ON BEHALF OF THE STATE COALITION PROVISIONAL REALIZATIONS. PREVAILED IN OPPOSITION WE APPRECIATE THE DOCTORS MEETING WITH US AND DISCUSSING SOME OF THE CHALLENGES. I WANT TO JUST START OFF BY RECOGNIZING THAT THE THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS CLEARLY. THERE ARE SOME ABUSES IN THE SYSTEM CLEARLY STUDENTS THAT ARE ARE. NEARLY TRUANTS OR HAVE SOME BEHAVIORAL CHALLENGES SHOULD BE PUT ON PROBATION. UNFORTUNATELY THOUGH THE WAY THE BILL IS WRITTEN NOW -- DAHLE NOBLE INTENTION WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE ABILITY OF PREVENTION DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEES OFFICERS TO ENGAGE IN PREVENTIVE ACTIVITIES. WITH SOME OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE YOUTH TAKEN TOGETHER SECTIONS TWO THIRTY SIX AND SIX OH ONE WHICH OF AND REFERENCE BEFORE LAW PROVISIONAL STIRS TO ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES. THAT ARE DESIGNED TO PREVENT JUVENILES FROM EVER ENTERING THE DELINQUENCY SYSTEMS. THESE TWO SECTIONS ARE BEING USED TODAY THROUGHOUT THE STATE BY PROVISIONAL FARMERS TO COURT ACTIVITIES AND SERVICES THE SOCIAL WORKERS. FOR YOU TO UNDERPINS STATUS AND FOR YOU TO MAY SIMPLY BE IDENTIFIED AS AT RISK. IF ENACTED SUCH COLLABORATIVE APPROACHES WOULD BE BARRED AND MORE IMPORTANTLY PREVENTION FARMS ROLE LONGER BE ALLOWED TO TAKE PROACTIVE APPROACH IS WITHOUT RISK USE IN ADDITION AS WRITTEN A. B. NINE A ONE WHAT PRIVATE PROBATION OFFICERS TO OFFER ANY SERVICES OR ACTIVITIES TRAVIS USE. UNTIL THEY'RE FORMERLY PLACE IN THE DELINQUENCY SYSTEM WHICH MEANS. WE CAN IN PLACE ALSO NOT BE ALLOWED TO INTERVENE IN TOLL CHARGES ARE FORMALLY. ENTERED AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO PREVENT THIS BILL IS A LOSS TO DO THAT. REGRETTABLY WE OPPOSE THE BILL IN THE SETTLEMENT THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU NEXT GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS DANIEL SANCHEZ WITH THAT SHE PROBATION OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA -- I DO WANT TO SAY WE'VE HAD SOME PRELIMINARY -- AND EARLY DISCUSSIONS WITH THE SPONSOR AND AND AUTHORS OFFICE ON THIS AND AND SO WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THEIR DESIRE TO LOOK AT THE ISSUE OF HOW ARE WE WORKING WITH YOUTH -- PARTICULARLY IN OUR SCHOOLS WHATDOES THAT LOOK LIKE FOR SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS AND ADDRESSING BEHAVIOR AND SO WE'RE HAVING SOME OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS BUT I THINK THE CONCERN IS THAT. THIS BILL GOES MUCH MUCH FURTHER TO I TAKE AWAY THE ABILITY OF OF PROBATION -- TO WORK WITH YOUTH IN OUR COMMUNITIES BEFORE THEY'RE IN THE THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT OUR DATA OVER THE MANY YEARS AND DECADES ACTUALLY SHOWS THAT WE'VE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL AND WE HAVE BEEN. VERY MUCH COMMITTED -- TO SO ALL INTRODUCED AND AND LET SAID THAT YOU SPEAK TO THAT WELL WITH ME TODAY IS A CHEAP STEPHANIE GENE'S CHEAP PROBATION OFFICER OF SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY AND ALSO OUR CURRENT PRESIDENT OF C. PARK. MORNING MISS LOW CHAIR MEMBERS I APPRECIATE BEING HERE TO SPEAK TO THE VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE OF JUVENILE DIVERSION AND WE RESPECTFULLY ARE IN OPPOSITION TO AB NINE A WINE PROVISIONS BEEN COMMITTED TO IDENTIFYING DIVERTING YOUTH OUT OF JUVENILE HALLS AND OUT OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM WHEN APPROPRIATE AND IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE YOUTH IN OUR COMMUNITY. THIS IS EVIDENCED BY JUVENILE DETENTION RATES BEING DOWN 60% SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN WHICH ARE STILL CONTINUING TO DECLINE. FURTHER OF THE SEVENTY ONE THOUSAND REFERRALS TO PROBATION IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN OVER OUT WE UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN FOR NET WHITING BUT OUR DATA JUSTICE NOT SURE THAT THAT'S HAPPENING -- PROBATION APARTMENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE PROVIDE DIVERSION PROGRAMS TO YOUTH IN THE COMMUNITY THAT FOCUS ON BUILDING PROSOCIAL ACTIVITIES THE NETWORKS FAMILY SUPPORTS AND MANY OTHER PRO. PROGRAMS TO ASSIST YOUTH AND THEIR FAMILIES. MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS OFFER SERVICES NOT JUST TO THE YOUTH BUT TO THEIR SIBLINGS AND PARENTS AS WELL WHO MAY ALSO BENEFIT FROM THESE PROGRAMS. THIS BILL WOULD AND OUR ABILITY TO WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THIS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL AS GOVERNMENT ENTITIES. TO DIVERT YOUTH WHO ARE ENGAGING IN BEHAVIOR THAT PUT THEM AT RISK OF ENTERING THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. LASTLY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS MADE MEASURE DOES NOT ALL COUNTY IS DO NOT HAVE THE SAME RESOURCES WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. AS SUCH THIS BILL WOULD ELIMINATE THE ABILITY A PROBATION IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS AS WELL AS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. FROM PROVIDING PROGRAMS TO YOUTH IN THE COMMUNITY WHO CAN BENEFIT FROM SKILL BASED PROGRAMS COMMUNITY AND FAMILY SUPPORTS AND PROGRAMS THAT HELP BUILD PRO SOCIAL NETWORKS. IN HAS ACTIVELY LEAD CHANGES TO THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND HAS FOCUSED ON DIVERSION OUT OF THE SYSTEM AND OUT OF HALLS. AS WELL AS BUILDING COMMUNITY SUPPORTS WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT WOULD BE PRUDENT TO OUR YOUTH OR COMMUNITIES TO REMOVE PROBATION FROM WORKING WITH IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. TO REALLY ADDRESS THE FRONT END OF OUR SYSTEM AND FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO EIGHTY NINE A ONE THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. TWELVE THIRTY SECONDS [inaudible] GO. TIFFANY MATTHEWS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION THE MAIN ISSUE THAT WE HAVE WITH THIS BILL IS THAT IT TAKES AWAY THE COURT'S JURISDICTION OVER A MINOR DUE TO HABITUAL TRUANCY. HAVE VISUAL CURRENCIES RECOGNIZED AS A RELIABLE PREDICTOR OF FUTURE CONSOLIDATE WHAT YOU'VE NO COURT PROCEEDINGS CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT. BE VIEWED AS THE ONLY METHOD OF INTERVENTION IN THESE CASES. DESTRUCTION SUPERVISION THAT COULD BE PROVIDED BY THE JUVENILE COURT IS A VALUABLE TOOL IN HELPING -- MINERS WHO MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO RESOURCES ELSEWHERE RESPECTFULLY ASK VIDAK PUT THIS BILL. THANK YOU NEXT. CORSO'S ALONG WE HAVE A CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES ARE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS SEEING NONE [inaudible] MR SANTIAGO. BUT THE RESORT RJR WAS FIRST IS TIME. GOOD OF ALL RIGHT -- LOOK I'VE SEEN A LOT OF GREAT WORK DONE BY ALAMEDA COUNTY PROBATION. AND I THEREFORE REALLY THINK THAT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT -- THIS BILL BE NARROWED SO I WILL NOT SUPPORTED AT THIS TIME RESPOND. WHICH IS NOT YET. AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I THINK THE AUTHOR WAS VERY GENEROUS HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH ME OUTSIDE AND I WANT TO MAYBE -- MAYBE I DON'T I'M NOT ASKING FOR A RESPONSE RIGHT NOW BUT MAYBE TO THE SPONSORS AND THE AUTHOR. IF IF IT IS TRUE THAT THIS BILL DOES PREVENT -- THE ABILITY FROM -- FROM PREVENTING A PERSON FROM BEING CONVICTED BECAUSE OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT PROBATION OFFICERS ARE INCLUDED IN I MEAN THAT WOULD BE A I WOULD ASSUME AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WE WOULD NOT WANT TO FACE BECAUSE THE WE'RE ALL TRYING TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE IMPROVE PEOPLE'S LIVES. AND I KNOW THAT THAT'S WHAT THE OTHERS TRYING TO DO MAYBE THAT CAN BE ADDRESSED -- DOWN THE LINE BECAUSE IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT -- THAT WE VIEW THOSE POSITIVE THINGS THAT THAT PROVISIONAL OFFICER LAW ENFORCEMENT DO TO PREVENT A PERSON -- FROM GETTING -- GETTING CONVICTED THOSE ACTIVITIES I WOULD PUBLIC I WOULD ADVOCATE THAT BE ALLOWED. TO CONTINUE SO THAT WE DON'T GET TO THAT POINT -- THAT WOULD BE A TRAGEDY IN THIS BILL IF THAT WAS A THAT. LITTLE PART WAS NOT FIXED. AT THAT OF ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- WELL I CERTAINLY WANT TO KNOW IF CAN YOU ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION BECAUSE I THINK SOME OF THEM ARE INCREDIBLY VALID AND THEN MY SECOND QUESTION IS DOES THIS AT ALL I DRANK THE CLEARING OF TRUANCY RECORDS. PLEASE -- SO REGARDING ON THE ABILITY OF PROBATION APARTMENT ACROSS THE STATE TO PARK FILING DIVERSION WE WANT TO SUPPORT THAT. THE BILL DOESN'T PRECLUDE ANY OTHER ACTIVITIES FOR EXAMPLE WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT BRINGS YOUNG PEOPLE TO THE FRONT DOOR OF A JUVENILE HALL. PROBATION WAS STILL HAVE THE AUTHORITY AND WE WOULD WANT THEM TO HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DIVERT YOUNG PEOPLE AWAY IN A PRE FILING DIVERSION. SIMILARLY PROBATION WOULD STILL BE -- HAVING OPPORTUNITY IN COURT TO ARGUE FOR DIVERSION AWAY FROM MORE PUNITIVE SYSTEM SO -- WHETHER THAT'S A CAMPER RANCH PROGRAM -- EVEN A LOCKDOWN PLACEMENT VERSES A COMMUNITY -- DIVERSION PROVISIONS ROLE IN JUVENILE COURT WOULDN'T CHANGE IN TERMS OF THEIR ROLE -- DIVERTING IN PEOPLE AWAY FROM KUWAIT PROBATION VIOLATIONS INTO CUSTODY AND PROBATION COULD EITHER FUND OTHER PROGRAMS ARE THEY THEMSELVES RUN PROGRAMS AROUND ALTERNATIVES -- TO COURT ORDER -- CUSTODY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE INVOLVED IN PROBATION VIOLATIONS ON FURTHERMORE THERE THERE WAS A QUESTION FROM I KNOW ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY REGARDING -- TRUANCY ACCOUNTABILITY AND THIS BILL DOESN'T TOUCH THE ABILITY FOR LOCAL COUNTIES TO HOLD PRESS PARENTS ARM INVOLVED IN TRUANCY -- EITHER IN COURT TO THE DA'S OFFICE OR IN AN COMMUNITY MEANS -- IT DOES DECRIMINALIZE TRUANCY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE THAT SOMETHING IS ALREADY HAPPENED IN LA COUNTY -- AND TO GREAT EFFECT FOR EXAMPLE JUST LOOKING AT ONE SCHOOL DISTRICT VOTE SECOND LARGEST IN THE NATION LA UNIFIED. ON THE DECRIMINALIZATION OF TRUANCY INTO COMMUNITY BASED ON SCHOOL BASED PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS WHY YOUNG PEOPLE WEREN'T ATTENDING SCHOOL ACTUALLY INCREASED IN THIS IS THE SCHOOL DISTRICT GIVING THIS DATA. INCREASE GRADUATION RATES IN LA COUNTY FROM 40% TO OVER 60% AND THE DIVERSION ALL RIGHT AWAY FROM CRIMINALIZING CHOICE HE WAS ONE OF THE MAIN THINGS THAT WAS CITED AS A REASON FOR THAT OKAY I I KNOW IT'S MISS KAMLAGER-DOVE QUESTION. HOPEFULLY YOU BENEFITTED AND I COULD SEE YOU CAN MISS MCGILL YOU HAVE YOU CAN READ MISTER. LACKEYS MIND HE DID ASK THE QUESTION HERE RIGHT NOW BUT I WAS PRETTY GOOD. MISTER BAUER K. IS. YOU KNOW I THINK THAT WE ALL AGREE WITH. THE OPPOSITION THAT WE WANT TO AVOID KIDS GETTING INTO THE DELINQUENCY SYSTEM THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THAT'S THE GOAL OF EVERYBODY -- AND THE QUESTIONS OF THOSE PROGRAMS THAT YOU'RE PROVIDING. THAT PREVENT THAT ALTHOUGH GOOD THE QUESTION IS THAT I THINK POSED BY MR GIVES AND IS. IS THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THE RIGHT PLACE TO BE PUTTING THOSE PEOPLE TO GET THE SERVICES TO PREVENT IT BECAUSE I DO THINK THERE IS THE QUESTION THAT ONCE. THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO I'M SURE ARE MOSTLY BLACK AND BROWN TOUCH THE COLONEL JUSTICE SYSTEM THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO END UP IN IT IN A DELINQUENCY SETTING. AND WE WANT TO PREVENT THAT AND SO I GUESS I WOULD RAISE THE QUESTION OF NOT. LET'S NOT GET RID OF THOSE PROGRAMS BUT WHO IS THE APPROPRIATE. FORTY TO BE DOING THOSE THINGS THAT'S GOING TO DO THOSE THINGS BUT IS A PROBATION IT SHOULD BE DOING THEM. AND THEN. I GUESS ONE OF MY BIGGEST ISSUES AND I WAS CURIOUS TO KNOW IF MR QUIRKS. AMENDMENTS HE WANTS TO SEE BECAUSE PART OF WHAT BOTHERS ME SO MUCH ABOUT THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS THESE ARE JUVENILES WHO HAVE NOT COMMITTED A CRIME AND THERE'S NO PARENTAL CONSENT. AND NOT IS WITHOUT QUESTION AN ACCEPTABLE [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. WHAT THAT A QUESTION I JUST STATEMENT? MISS POWER QUE. YOU'RE JUST STATEMENT. OKAY. AS A SEE THROUGH THE CHAIR. WE HAVE TELL YOU IT. DO IT IN YOUR CLOTHES. IF YOU NEED HELP FROM ANY OF THE WITNESSES TAKEN. COMMENT [inaudible] ABSOLUTELY OKAY. FOR NOW I WAS GOING TO CLOSE. FIRST OF ALL THERE IS A I APPRECIATE WHAT THE ROBUST CONVERSATION I WANT TO MAKE A POINT THAT WE IN FACT MET WITH PROBATION AS OF YESTERDAY AND WE HAVE A MEETING SCHEDULED FOR FOUR O'CLOCK TOMORROW MY OFFICE. TO REACH AND TO ADDRESS -- THEIR CONCERNS AND SO THIS IS ALL GOING PROCESS WE ARE OPEN -- TO THEIR SUGGESTS IS TRY TO MAKE THIS BILL BETTER AGAIN IT GOES BACK -- TO THE MEMBER A FEW MOMENTS AGO -- TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW CHILDREN BEING IN A VOLUNTEER SITUATION BEING TREATED AS IF THEY'RE CRIMINALS AND THAT'S WE WANTED. IN FACT TO PREVENT -- 80% OF THOSE WHO ARE ON VOLUNTARY -- PROBATION ARE BEING TREATED THIS WAY THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH OR NORT DOES IT STOP THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT OR ANY OTHER -- GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY FOR PROVIDING THE KIND OF SERVICES THAT A FAMILY OR YOUNG PERSON NEEDS THEY CAN CONTINUE TO DO THAT. AND WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT IS THOSE WHO HAVE NOT. BEEN IN THE COURT SYSTEM IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM IT'S OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WOULD NOT EVEN COMMITTED ANY CRIME -- WHO'VE BEEN TREATED LIKE THE CRIMINALS EVEN BEFORE WE HAVE PARENTS WHO HAVE NOT EVEN HAD OPPORTUNITY TO EVEN CONSULT ANY KIND OF ATTORNEY OF THEIR RIGHTS BEEN FOR THE CHILD'S BEEN FORCED IN THIS PARTICULAR -- SITUATION AND THAT'S UNFAIR AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS THE BROAD -- AUTHORITY THAT THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT HAS -- WE WANT TO LIMIT IT BECAUSE THEY THEY HAVE BROAD DISCRETION AND WE HAVE KIDS WHO ARE AGAIN INNOCENT WHO HAVE NOT COMMITTED ANY CRIME WHO'S BEEN SWEPT UP AND BEING TREATED UNFAIRLY I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I BOAT. OKAY. WE NEED A MOTION AND A SECOND -- MOVED. OKAY SO CHAIRS RECOMMEND I BASED ON WHAT WAS TOLD TO ME BY THE REPRESENTATIVES FROM PROBATION OFFICERS -- SPECIFICALLY THAT THEY'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR ABSOLUTELY TO TRY TO WORK THROUGH ALL OF THESE ISSUES AND THAT'S WHY DIDN'T I HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN INVOLVED BECAUSE IT SOUNDED LIKE AGAIN FROM THE PROBATION SIDE. THAT IT WOULD THEY WERE VERY ENCOURAGE WITH WORKING WITH YOU MISTER GIPSON. OF THIS ALREADY SOME CLARIFYING LANGUAGE SO THAT. SO THAT NO ONE FEELS THAT. WE WE STEIN YOUR WE STOP ANY EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT COULD BE VERY HELPFUL FOR FOR THE USE. OF SPECIALLY FROM PROBATION OFFICERS PROBATION OFFICERS WHAT I WOULD. TELL YOU. THERE WAS A YOUNG WOMAN HERE IN TEARS. THAT SHOULD TELL YOU THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG AND DON'T GET TOO BUREAUCRATIC ABOUT THIS THIS THIS AND THAT. BUT REALLY GET INTO THE PAIN OF THAT YOUNG PERSON WHO SAT HERE AND BRAVELY TESTIFIED TODAY -- FOR OF ALL THESE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD THAT. THERE'S A PROBLEM. AND BIG OF AN END YOU REALLY NEED TO ADDRESS IT AND ADDRESS IT NOW. AND SO MISTER GIPSON WITH THAT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU WILL WORK THROUGH THESE THESE PROBLEMS ARE ABSOLUTELY -- SPECIAL ANY GETS HOPE YOU IRONED OUT. OF IN APPROPRIATIONS GUIDING DEBTS WERE WE COULD YOU GO NEXT --% OTHERWISE IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO GET THIS OUT AFTER THAT SO I WOULD I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU. YOU ARE NOT A LOT OF THESE THESE ISSUES AND GIVE SOME CERTAINTY AND SOME CERTAINTY LANGUAGES TO TO MAKE THIS COMMITTEE FEEL GOOD.

IS BEING SOLD ILLEGALLY AND YOU KNOW -- DIED IT WILL END UP IN THE WRONG HANDS AND FORCE VOTE. SOMETIMES IT USED TO COMMITTED. CRIMINAL THE CRIMES. ALTHOUGH CURRENT LAW REQUIRE HAND GOING TO BE LOCKED. IN AND ALL OF SITE IT DOESN'T APPLY TO ORDER TYPE OF FIREARMS THAT COULD CALLS EVEN MORE DAMAGE. SO SMASH AND GRAB ARE CONSTANTLY UNDER RIGHTS THROUGH ALL THE STATE. AND IT IS TOO EASY TO GRAB A BOX NOT ATTENDED A NOT ATTACHED TO THE CAR. SO IT IS MY DISTRICT -- OURS SEEN UP TO NINE HISTORY INCREASE IN SOUTH FROM BILL CALLS SO CALLED TWENTY A HAS MADE GREAT PROGRESS TO ENSURE. THAT GUNS DO NOT END UP IN THE WRONG HANDS IMPROPER STORAGE WHEN THE ALIVE AND AND ATTENDED INTO CARD WILL HELP LUIS WAS THIS ISSUE. THE THE CHAIN REQUIRE IN MY BILL ARE REALLY AN ANNEX NG EXPENSIVE SOLUTION AND WILL SERVE AS A DETERRENT AGAINST DOES LOOKING TO STILL FIREARMS. FOR UNLAWFUL PURPOSES AND HERE WITH ME TODAY IS A VERY SPECIAL WERE OF A WITNESSES ALSO THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL NANCY ALL MOLLY. IS ONE OF THE THAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY FROM ALAMEDA COUNTY. AND WHOSE LOS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR COMING UP HERE. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON. I AS IT ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU SAID MY OFFICE AND I HAVE DONE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RESEARCH ON GUN IN GUN VIOLENCE. FOR THE PURPOSE OF PREVENTION WE PUBLISH REPORT. EVERY FEW YEARS THAT REALLY CHRONICLES STOLEN GUNS HOW GUNS AND UP IN THE WRONG HANDS. SO I WANT -- TO MAKE THE FIRST POINT THAT THIS IS NOT A BILL THAT WOULD TAKE FIREARMS AWAY FROM LAWFUL OWNERS [inaudible] USE ME. THIS IS REALLY A BILL TO KEEP THOSE LAWFUL GUNS IN THE RIGHT HANDS. AND WE HAVE FAR TOO MANY EXAMPLES OF GUNS BEING STOLEN OUT OF CARS AND THEN ULTIMATELY USED IN CRIMES JUST IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN THERE ARE OVER TEN THOUSAND ALMOST ELEVEN THOUSAND GUN STOLEN IN CALIFORNIA. AND IN MY COUNTY ALONE THREE HUNDRED TWENTY SIX STOLEN GUNS A GOOD PERCENTAGE OF THAT CAME OUT OF CARS -- WE HAVE AS I SAID TOO MANY EXAMPLES OF CARS BEING BROKEN INTO AND FIREARM STOLEN THAT AREN'T LOCKED UP OR NOT SECURELY LOCKED UP -- JUST LAST WEEK IN BERKELEY WE HAD A CAR GET BROKEN INTO THE FIRE WAS IN THE CAR IT WAS STOLEN AND THIS HAPPENS. FAR TOO OFTEN. SO THIS THE OTHER POINT TO MAKE IS THAT THE WHEN THIS BILL A RICH WHEN THE LOT ORIGINALLY PASSED. TO REQUIRE FIRES BE LOCKED UP IT LEFT OUT LONG GUNS. AND IN MY COUNTY -- THAT OVER THE FIVE YEAR PERIOD OF OUR THREE THOUSAND MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND FIREARMS THAT WERE USED IN CRIMES. IN ALAMEDA COUNTY HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE RIFLES. HUNDRED NINETY FOUR WERE SHOT GUNS AND HUNDRED FOURTEEN MORE ASSAULT WEAPONS AND THOSE WERE ALL STOLEN. SO THIS BILL NOT ONLY DOES IT ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF BEING MORE SECURELY LOCKED UP SO THAT IF SOMEONE DOES BREAK INTO A CAR. IT'S NOT EASY TO GET A GUN OUT OR FIRE ABOUT BUT SECONDLY IT JUST EXT EXTENDS THE THE CURRENT LAW TO INCLUDE THOSE LONG GUNS THAT ARE. OFTEN TIMES USING CRIMES ESPECIALLY ASSAULT WEAPONS. SO WITH THAT I URGE AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU OR ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. QUESTION MEMBERS COURCELLES ALONG THE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION -- RESPECTFULLY OPPOSITION ESPECIALLY MIKE GOOD FRIEND AND FORMER BOSS AND MENTOR. I PROMISE TO BE NICE. WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS ABOUT FIREARMS BEING STOLEN SPECIFICALLY BEING STOLEN FROM VEHICLES. WE HAVE TWO MAIN POINTS WE WANTED TO KNOW TODAY AND WE HAVE TALKED WITH THE AUTHOR WITH THE STAFF WITH THE PROPONENTS -- AND WILL CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT IT BUT THE THE TWO ISSUES WE WANTED TO RACE TODAY -- ONE THE THE ADDITIONAL LOCKING REQUIREMENTS -- AS IT RELATES TO LONG GUNS COULD IMPACT THE TIME IT TAKES TO ACCESS THE WEAPON IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION SO. IF IT'S A SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH AN ADDITIONAL LOCKER ANOTHER LATCH OR SOME SOME FUNCTION IT'S SOMETHING THAT TAKES A SECOND OR TWO COULD MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION. I'M NOT TRYING TO RESERVE THE HYPERBOLE BUT THAT'S THE REALITY OF OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS TO ACCESS THEIR TOOLS. SECOND AS A PRACTICAL MATTER EQUIPPING VEHICLES OR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHETHER IT'S CABLE LOCK OR SOMETHING THAT'S PERMANENTLY AFFIXED TO THE TO THE VEHICLE -- IT IT IT'S THERE'S A MANDATE THERE'S A COST THERE IS GONNA BE COST OF THIS IS NO FUNDING IN THE BILL -- AND WHEN TO STAND THAT WILL BE ADDRESSED PRESUABLY IN THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE BUT JUST WANTED TO RAISE THOSE THINGS THAT IT'S NOT JUST SO EASY AS JUST GO DOWN TO THE STORE GO TO AMAZON AND PICK UP OF A LOCK IT'S YOU KNOW THERE ARE OTHER. CONSIDERATIONS THAT HAVE TO BE DONE AND THAT HAS TO BE RECOGNIZED YOU KNOW TENS OF THOUSANDS OF TIMES. BECAUSE THERE ARE THAT MANY POLICE VEHICLES -- PLEASE OFTEN TRAVEL AWAY FROM THEIR JURISDICTIONS THEY MAY HAVE THEIR WEAPONS THEY MAY HAVE A RENTAL CAR THE RENTAL CAR WOULD HAVE TO BE SIMILARLY EQUIPPED. THEY MAY BE IN A SITUATION SITUATION THEY MAY HAVE A SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT WHERE PERHAPS THERE ON A SWAT TEAM THEY TAKE THEIR WEAPON WITH THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE. DEPLOYED FROM WHEREVER THEY ARE AT THE TIME AND THAT WEAPON MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BE LOCKED IN THE CENTER -- CENTER REGION OF THE CAR -- SO THERE ARE SOME VERY PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AT AT BAR HERE AND I WILL WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE DISCUSSING WHAT THE AUTHOR BUT AT THIS TIME ARE POSTED ALL THANK YOU. YES. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE RECORD AND RE WITH NATURAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION ALSO HERE. FOR GUN OWNERS THE CALIFORNIA'S MISTER BROTHERS AS I SAID EARLIER HAD A FAMILY EMERGENCY. BUT WERE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL -- WE FEEL THAT IT'S OVERLY BURDENSOME AND IN SOME CASES UNATTAINABLE -- THE THE BILL CALLS FOR LOCKING IT TO THE FRAME OF THE CAR AND WE'VE SEEN A COUPLE OF THINGS NUMBER ONE WE SEE IN THE AUTO INDUSTRY GOING AWAY FROM USING FRAMES AND AUTOMOBILES AND THEY'RE USING A UNIBODY CONSTRUCTION. AND THEN ALSO WITH SOME OF THE HYBRID SUCH AS TESTS WAS YOU CAN'T EVEN ACCESS THE FRAME BECAUSE OF HOW THE BATTERY SETS. AND SO -- COMPLIANCE WITH THIS WOULD BE VERY COSTLY -- AND COULD BE INCREDIBLY PROBLEMATIC -- FOR SOMEONE WHO'S GOING OUT TO THE FIELD ARE GOING TO THE RANGE -- ALSO OBVIOUSLY THIS IS AN EXPANSION BE ON HAND GUNS TO LONG GUNS AND THE NEW REQUIREMENTS. YOUR LONG GUNS ARE. LARGER AND AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE WHEN THEY'RE GOING OUT TO THE FIELD OR THEY'RE GOING TO THE RANGE THEY'RE TAKING SEVERAL FIREARMS AND SO -- IF THEY'RE GONNA STOP AND HAVE ONE SURE OR GET GAS OR OR DO SOMETHING TO DEVIATE FROM THEIR PAST ALL THE SUDDEN -- THE STORAGE REQUIREMENTS COME IN AND IT'S JUST REALLY NOT ATTAINABLE -- ONE OTHER ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO BRING UP AS COMMON CARRIERS AND HOW ARE THE FED EX'S AND YOU PS IS THE WORLD GOING TO COMPLY WITH THIS THEY DO SHIP FIREARMS EVERYDAY TO DEALERS. THAT'S HOW THEY GO FROM THE DISTRIBUTORS TO THE DEALERS IN THE STATE AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS. TO NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT SO AND WITH THAT WERE IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION NAME AN ORGANIZATION. THANK YOU CHAIR MY NAME'S MICHAEL FINLEY AND WITH THE NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION I'D LIKE TO ECHO ON EVERYTHING THAT DâN WERE READ SAID IN TERMS OF FFL DEALERS DâN NAME AN ORGANIZATION -- JUST NAME AN ORGANIZATION BUT AS WE HI JEFF REVOLVERS CALIFORNIA WATERFOWL ASSOCIATION AND WILL. CARRY ON WITH THE AUTHOR ON THIS BILL WERE IN OPPOSITION. OKAY THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN ROY GRIFFITH ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA RIFLE AND PISTOL ASSOCIATION WERE IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU OF ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I JUST [inaudible] IS THIS. THIS LAW DOES NOT EXAM PEACE OFFICERS RIGHT. WHO -- AND DEFINITELY WILL WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE PEACE OFFICERS TO SEE WHAT KIND OF HELP PUT. THE EXEMPTION BUT I CAN TELL DAY IN TEN OF THOSE LAWS NOT TRYING TO MAKE THE PEACE OFFICERS. MOTIVE DIFFICULT TO PERFORM THEIR JOB IS REALLY TO MAKE SURE THAT -- WE DON'T. EASILY AT THE LEVEL THAT THOSE GUNS GET ANNA AND UP IN THE WRONG HANDS. INTO OURS FROM A CASES SO I GUESS THE THAT THOSE WEAPONS OR ARE STOLEN FROM THE PEACE OFFICERS OF POSSESSION. SO -- WHAT WE WILL CONTINUE WORKING WAS AT PEACE OFFICERS ON THIS ISSUE AND HOW DOES THIS ENCOURAGE SOMEONE TO REPORT THAT THEIR GUN HAS BEEN STOLEN? BECAUSE IF IF A GUN IS STOLEN AND THEY REPORTED THEN YOU KNOW. THERE IT'S PUNISHABLE AS A CRIME THEY'RE FINE BUT SO HOW DOES THIS ENCOURAGE FOLKS TO ACTUALLY YOU KNOW REPORT A STOLEN GUN. AGAINST YOUR CONCERN IS THAT BECAUSE WE REQUIRED THEM TO CHANGE THAT AND THEY DON'T THEY DIDN'T CHANGE THE AND THEY GOT STOLEN -- SO THERE MIGHT BE HESITANT OF REPORTING TO THE DISTILLING A SOLUTION TO STOLEN -- GUN I I I I I I I AND I KNOW I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN WILL YOU KNOW WOULD BE -- THERE'S REALLY NEED NOT THE REAL. TENTATIVE -- MEASURE ON THIS BILL TO SAY HEY IF YOU LOCK UP YOUR CONSOLE ALLOW IT TO THROW YOU IN JAIL SO -- IS NOT A PUNITIVE [inaudible] VOTE BLUE [inaudible] FIND [inaudible] GETTING INTO. I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW IT ENCOURAGES FOLKS TO DO THE RIGHT THING -- WHOA WHOA WILL CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO DO THE RIGHT THING BUT AGAIN THIS BILL. A IS FOCUS ON HOW DO YOU PROTECT THE FOOT FOR THE LEGAL GONE OWNER TO PROTECT YOUR PROPERTY. OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. YOU MAY CLOSE PROCEDURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- OF WOULD TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOU KNOW CONTINUE WORKING WAS THE PEACE OFFICERS. AND TRYING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE DO YOU SHOULD THE SOME OF SOMETIME THURSDAY DID THE PEACE OFFICERS WERE WEAPONS GAR.

DESTINY HAD A HIGH RISK PREGNANCY DUE TO A PREVIOUS STILLBORN SHE FELT SHARP PAINS IN HER STOMACH AND PUSHED HER EMERGENCY BUTTON. SHE WAS HAD TO WAIT THIRTY MINUTES BEFORE SHE WAS TAKEN TO THE CLINIC WHERE THERE WAS NO DOCTOR OB NURSE ON DUTY SHE WAS TOLD SHOULD HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT DAY TO SEE A DOCTOR. WE ALSO SAW INDIVIDUALS PLACED IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT RIGHT AFTER GIVING BIRTH. AFTER BEING SEPARATED FROM HER BABY FOR TWO DAYS PATH WAS PLACED IN A TOP BUNK AND A NEW CELL DESPITE THE FACT SHE WAS RECOVERING FROM A C. SECTION. THE DEPUTIES SEARCHED OUR BELONGINGS FOUND SOMETHING OBJECT DOUBLE AND SHE WAS SENTENCED TO SOLITARY CONFINEMENT FOR TWENTY DAYS SHE WAS RELEASED AFTER THREE DAYS ONLY BECAUSE A LAWYER INTERVENED ON HER BEHALF. THE LOSSES IN COUNTLESS STORIES OF RATIONING OF MENSA PRODUCTS IN JAILS. THAT BILL HAD A MEDICAL CONDITION THAT CAUSED HER TO BLEED HEAVILY DURING HER PERIODS DESPITE A DOCTOR'SNOTE HER JAIL ONLY ALLOWED ONE THIN PAD PER DAY PER PERSON. SHE REPORTED OTHER PEOPLE PRESIDING TO MAKING THEIR OWN PADS AND TAMPONS OUT OF TOILET PAPER SOCKS AND WATCH CLASS OTHERS BLOOD THROUGH THEIR CLOTHES AND HAD TO WAIT DAYS FRIEND CLEAN CLOTHES. THIS BILL ALIGNS WITH OTHER COMMON SENSE REFORMS IN THE LEGISLATURE SUCH AS SENATOR MITCHELL'S BILL SB FOURTEEN THIRTY THREE THAT EXPANDED BIRTH CONTROL MENTAL PRODUCT ACCESS IN PRISONS.

THE THE MANDATE THAT PRENATAL AND POST PARTUM CARE BE DELIVERED BUT THAT. THE BILL GETS INTO SPECIFIC LEVELS OF DETAIL OF HOW FREQUENTLY OF A PREGNANT INMATE MUST VISIT -- THE DOCTOR -- THE THE NATURE OF WHICH THE VITAMINS THAT MUST BE PROVIDED -- IT EXISTING REGULATIONS GOVERNING CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES INCLUDING JAILS -- THEY HAVE THEIR REQUIRED TO HAVE WRITTEN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT PROVIDE FOR SCREENING AND CARE PREGNANT INMATES. THIS INCLUDES PRENATAL AND POST PARTUM INFORMATION AND HEALTH CARE INCLUDING PRENATAL VITAMINS INFORMATION ABOUT CHILD BIRTH EDUCATION -- INFANT CARE -- SITTING THESE PROVISIONS AND STATURE LIMITS FLEXIBILITY MANY OF THESE DISCRETE REQUIREMENTS ARE ALREADY BEING UNDERTAKEN IN COUNTY JAILS ACROSS THE STATE NOT NECESSARILY TO THE DEGREE.

AN EIGHTY SEVEN THIRTY TO THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER I TO ANSWER I LACKEY. LACKEY I BAUER-KAHAN. BAUER-KAHAN I DEEP. KAMLAGER-DOVE. HI KAMLAGER-DOVE I QUIRK. WHICH IS WORKING AT TWO YOU MAY BEGIN MISTER BONTA THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR COLLEAGUES THIS IS AB NINE SEVENTY TWO ARE AUTOMATIC RECORDS MODIFICATIONS. BILL WHICH CREATES A SIMPLER MORE EFFICIENT MORE EXPEDITED PATHWAY FOR THOSE CALIFORNIANS ELIGIBLE UNDER PROP. FORTY SEVEN TO MODIFY THEIR CONVICTIONS TO BECOME MISDEMEANORS RATHER THAN HAVING TO PETITION -- WELL RATHER THAN HAVING TO KNOW THEY'RE ELIGIBLE AND THEN -- GEN AND AND AND PICASSO PETITIONING MAYBE EVEN SEEK LEGAL COUNSEL -- WE'RE PROPOSING AN APPROACH THAT WE USE LAST YEAR FOR PROP SIXTY FOUR ELIGIBLE -- REDUCTIONS AN EXPUNGEMENT SWEAR BY THE DOJ WILL RUN A DATABASE -- IDENTIFY ELIGIBLE CONVICTIONS DAYS WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO OBJECT AND THEN -- THE X. THE MODIFICATIONS WILL OCCUR AUTOMATICALLY SO WE THINK THIS IS THAT A NEW APPROACH A BETTER APPROACH I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. AND WITH ME I HAVE YVONNE SILVA WITH CODE FOR AMERICA TO DISCUSS THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THE PROCESS. AND ALSO HILARY BLOW OUT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SENTENCE REVIEW PROJECT [inaudible] THANK YOU[inaudible] YES. HI MY NAME'S YVONNE SILVA SENIOR PROGRAM DIRECTOR WITH CODE FOR AMERICA AND I'M HERE TODAY SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF GOOD FOR AMERICA NONPROFIT THAT USES. THE PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES OF THE DIGITAL AGE TO IMPROVE OUR GOVERNMENT SERVICE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. I COULD FOR AMERICA WE BELIEVE THAT GOVERNMENT CAN WORK DRAMATICALLY BETTER THAN IT DOES TODAY AND THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS ONE OF THE AREAS WHERE WERE FAILING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE POST. CALIFORNIA'S RECORD CLEARANCE PROCESS WAS NOT DESIGNED FOR THE DIGITAL AGE THE PETITION BASE PROCESS DOESN'T WORK IT'S COSTLY IT'S CUMBERSOME IT'S CONFUSING IN WAS NOT DESIGNED TO PROVIDE THE RELIEF. APPROVED BY THE VOTERS IN AVAILABLE UNDER STATE LAW. GOOD FOR AMERICA'S BEEN WORKING TO TRANSFORM THE WAY GOVERNMENT DELIVER SERVICES TO THOSE IMPACTED BY THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ONE OF THE WAYS WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS IS BY RE IMAGINING THAT CALIFORNIA'S RECORD CLEARANCE PROCESS LEVERAGING. THE PRINCIPLES OF USER CENTERED DESIGN. OUR WORK HAS SHOWN THE CALIFORNIA CAN'T IMPLEMENT AUTOMATIC RECORD CLEARANCE AND MODIFICATION AT SCALE. AS YOU MAY RECALL A LAW PASSED LAST SESSION AB SEVENTEEN NINETY THREE EXPEDITES REVIEW OF CONVICTIONS ELIGIBLE UNDER PROP. SIXTY FOUR AND MAKES RELIEF FOR ELIGIBLE CONVICTIONS AUTOMATIC WITH NO PETITION REQUIRED -- BY THE INDIVIDUAL. WE LAUNCHED A PILOT LAST YEAR TO PARTNER WITH DISTRICT ATTORNEYS IN FIVE COUNTIES TO EXPEDITE THE REVIEW OF CONVICTIONS UNDER PROP. SIXTY FOUR WITH THE PASSAGE OF AB SEVENTEEN NINETY THREE THIS COHORT WILL NOW SET THE STANDARD FOR IMPLEMENTATION. AND MAKE REAL THE RELIEF AVAILABLE TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS UNDER PROP. SIXTY FOUR THE SAME IS POSSIBLE FOR CONVICTIONS UNDER PROP FORTY SEVEN AS CONTEMPLATED BY. EIGHTY NINE SEVENTY TWO WE'VE BUILT A TOOL THAT WE CALL CLEAR MY RECORD THAT CAN NOW READ CRIMINAL HISTORY DATA AND DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY FOR CONVICTIONS FOR THOUSANDS OF CONVICTIONS IN JUST A FEW MINUTES. AS OPPOSED TO WEEKS MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS. THIS SHIFT ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TO PETITION FOR THE FOR RELIEF AND FOR DA STAFF TO GO THROUGH RECORDS ONE BY. ONE TO OBSTACLES TO RECORD CLEARANCE. IT'S ESTIMATED THAT A DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE OR AN ATTORNEY IN GENERAL -- ON AVERAGE TAKES FIFTEEN TO THIRTY MINUTES TO REVIEW A CRIMINAL RECORD TO VALUE ELIGIBILITY FOR RECORD MODIFICATION. OUR TOOL CAN READ FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND LINES OF CRIMINAL HISTORY DATA NINETY SECONDS. THERE'S NO NEED FOR GOVERNMENT TO MANUALLY SEARCH FOR AN ANALYZE CRIMINAL RECORDS OR CRIMINAL HISTORY DATA TO DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY FOR RECORD MODIFICATION. STREAMLINING CONVICTION DATA PROCESSING THROUGH OUR TOOL ALSO MAKES IT EASIER FOR COURTS TO UPDATE THEIR RECORDS WHICH HELPS TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE GET THE RELIEF AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. PUT SIMPLY THERE'S A WAY FOR PROSECUTORS OFFICES TO REVIEW AND EVALUATE EDGE ABILITY FOR RECORD MODIFICATION FOR ALL CASES WITHIN ITS JURISDICTION AT AN EXPONENTIALLY FASTER PACE IN SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER COST. TECHNOLOGY WORKS BEST WHEN IT'S SIMPLE AND EASY TO USE AND CLEAR MY RECORD IS A PRIME EXAMPLE. WE BUILT THIS TOOL IN PARTNERSHIP WITH GOVERNMENT WITH A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF POLICY IN GOVERNMENT NEEDS AND RECOGNIZING THAT THE CURRENT PETITION BASED PROCESS WAS NOT DESIGNED TO SERVE ALL WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TODAY. GOVERNMENT HAS THE ABILITY TO FILL THE RECORD MODIFICATION INTENT OF PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN IN A MANNER THAT SIMPLER. EXPEDITIOUS LESS EXPENSIVE AND THAT SERVES THE CONSTITUENTS BETTER. EIGHTY NINE SEVENTY TWO BRINGS AS WELL ALL ONE STEP CLOSER TO RE IMAGINING EXISTING GOVERNMENT PROCESSES AND IN TURN DELIVERING ON THE PROMISE OF PROP FORTY SEVEN TO REDUCE BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU. I'M GOOD MORNING -- THANK YOU -- MY NAME IS HILARY BLOWOUT AND I JUST WANTED. TO SHARE JUST A COUPLE REAL WORLD EXAMPLES ABOUT WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED DURING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PROP. FORTY SEVEN SO I WAS THE PROP FORTY SEVEN IMPLEMENTATION DIRECTOR FOR THE STATE FOR CALIFORNIANS FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE AND SPENT THREE YEARS TRYING TO IDENTIFY WAYS TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS AND IDENTIFY. THE MILLION PEOPLE -- THAT WE KNEW THAT STOOD TO BENEFIT FROM PROP FORTY SEVEN AND I TELL YOU WE TRIED EVERYTHING -- WE TRIED TO DO IS STATEWIDE SYSTEM -- BUT WE HAD DIFFERENT COUNTIES HAVING DIFFERENT FORMS IN DIFFERENT PROCESSES WE HAD PEOPLE GOING TO ONE COUNTY THINKING THAT THEY CLEARED ALL THEIR CONVICTIONS GOING TO GET JOBS AND STILL GETTING DENIED BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T REALIZE THEY HAD A CONVICTION IN ANOTHER COUNTY. WE TRY TO WORK WITH THE J. TO GET STATEWIDE RAPSHEETS SO THAT WE CAN REALLY GET IN A CLEAR ALL OF THE RECORDS ON A PERSON'S -- RAP SHEET AND THAT PRESENTED ITS OWN BERRIER SINCE GETTING THE RAP SHEET ITSELF COSTS SIXTY DOLLARS SO THEN WE WHEN WE TRY TO DO RAP SHEET EVENTS AND CLINICS AND WE DID. THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF INTERVIEWS AND DISCUSSIONS WITH PEOPLE THAT HAD CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS ON THEIR RECORD WE BUILT CAPACITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE WITH COMMUNITY GROUPS GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATIONS LEGAL CLINICS CHURCHES YOU NAME IT WE BUILT CAPACITY ACROSS THE STATE IN THREE YEARS. AND WITH ALL OF THAT THEY'RE STILL. I THINK THE NUMBERS A MILLION PEOPLE THAT STILL STAND TO BENEFIT. SO THE ONLY WAY THAT WE CAN REALLY MAKE THE PROMISE OF PROP FORTY SEVEN REAL IS TO HAVE SOME AUTOMATED MECHANISM OR WE CAN TARGET THE PEOPLE THAT. ARE ELIGIBLE AND THEN WE CAN GO OUT IT FROM THAT DIRECTION I WANT TO LIFT OF ONE OTHER PIECE THAT HASN'T BEEN MENTIONED HERE AND THAT'S THE FACT THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL NON CITIZENS THAT ALSO STAND TO BENEFIT FROM PROP. FORTY SEVEN AND THERE'S THERE ARE. MANY OF THEM THAT DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE COMING TO COURT AND A AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THE OPPORTUNITIES GIVEN THE FEDERAL ENFORCEMENT TACTICS ADVICE SO DOING THIS ALSO ALLOWS US TO GET AT THAT POPULATION WHO ALSO CAN BENEFIT. AND ALSO CAN AVOID MANDATORY DEPORTATION BY JUST CHANGING A FELONY TO A MISDEMEANOR THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN. SUPPORT. HELLO AGAIN DEREK MORGAN FOR THE ELEVATORS PERSONS. FORGIVE ME -- DEREK MORGAN FOR THE ELEVATOR CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS HERE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. MARGOT GEORGE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. RESIDENTS HALLS WITH NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS IN SUPPORT. MOLLY BYNUM UT W. ASKED ME LOCAL THEIR NINE THIRTY IN SUPPORT.

TYLER MAGANA -- SIXTY WITH COMMUNITY WORKS IN SUPPORT. ENGINE MINETTI WITH CALIFORNIANS FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE ALSO SPONSOR THE BILL IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. CAN MEMBERS TIFFANY MATTHEWS ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION. AND WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL. THIS BILL IMPOSES NEW AND POTENTIALLY TIME CONSUMING LEVELS OF SERVICE ON LOCAL PROSECUTOR OFFICES WITHOUT ALLOCATING SPECIFIC FUNDS IN THE BUDGET FOR THAT INCREASE. THERE IS A MANDATE BUT IT IS NOT GUARANTEED. THERE ARE MANY SITUATIONS WHERE A FOLLOW MANDATES DO THE WORK BUT NEVER SEE THE MONEY. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL CREATES A SEPARATION OF POWERS ISSUE. BY LEGISLATIVELY REQUIRING DISTRICT ATTORNEYS TO PRIORITIZE OUR RESOURCES TO REVIEW PRIOR CONVICTIONS. AND INFORM THE COURTS IN THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S WHICH CONVICTIONS DO OR DO NOT MEET THE CRITERIA FOR RE SENTENCING. IMPEDES ON OUR EXECUTIVE BRANCH DETERMINATION OF HOW WE ALLOCATE PROSECUTORIAL RESOURCES. THIS BILL IS IN ASKING US TO SIMPLY IDENTIFY WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR RELIEF. WOULD REQUIRE US TO LOOK AT THE PARTICULARS OF EACH CASE AND MAKE A FACTUAL DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THE PERSON IS ELIGIBLE. NEEDS TO BE A SEPARATION BETWEEN THE FUNCTIONS OF THE DA AND THE FUNCTIONS OF THE DEFENSE. THESE REQUIREMENTS PUSH US INTO THE REALM OF ADVOCACY IN DEFENSE WHICH WE BELIEVE IS MORE APPROPRIATELY HANDLED BY THE DEFENSE BY RATHER THAN TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY. FOR THESE REASONS WE REQUEST ANOTHER. ARE ANY OF THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YOU MAY CLOSE FIRST ABOUT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- THE PEOPLE ARE ASKING FOR THIS TO HAPPEN THEY'VE ASKED FOR IT TO HAPPEN THEY ASKED BACK IN. TWENTY FOURTEEN THAT THOSE WHO HAVE THE ELIGIBLE -- FELONY CONVICTION ON THE RECORD THAT THEY BE REDUCED TO MISDEMEANORS THAT HASN'T HAPPENED YET AND SO WERE WERE PROPOSING A PROCESS. THAT ALLOWS IT TO HAPPEN THAT MOVES IT FORWARD EFFICIENTLY AND ACCURATELY -- THE DA'S WILL HAVE TWO YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS UNDER THIS BILL. TO REVIEW I AM THE DOJ'S LAST AND AND AND TAKE ACTION ON THEM WE THINK THAT'S SUFFICIENT WE THINK THAT'S FAIR. WE ARE ALSO -- WELL AWARE THAT RESOURCES ARE NEEDED TO DO THIS WE'RE SEEKING MONEY THE BUDGET FOR THAT AS WELL SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT AND WE AGREE. AND WE'RE FIGHTING FOR THAT MONEY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK DR THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU MISTER BOB BONTA CHU IS RECOMMENDING ICE BUT SHE'S INTERESTING FOR FUNDING. SO CALLED.

A WHAT MY BILL SEEKS TO DO IS PROVIDE THAT FUNDING STREAM AT THE COUNTY LEVEL SO THAT VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING CAN GET SUPPORT SERVICES SUCH AS COUNSELING RELOCATION OTHER SERVICES. AS THE CHAIR KNOWS THE VICTIMS COMPENSATION FUND IS UNDER SOME STRESS THIS WILL CREATE A SEPARATE STANDALONE FUNDING SOURCE. AND ALLOW -- COUNTIES TO RETAIN SOLICITATION AND DIRECT THAT INTO HELPING VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING -- I DON'T HAVE ANY WITNESSES TODAY AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S WORK ON THIS BILL ACCEPT AMENDMENTS AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NOT ABOUT. OKAY WELL I'LL ASK ANYWAY ORDER ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. LOOK THEY'RE ASKING RETAIN THE IMAGE. NOT THIS YEAR [inaudible] OKAY. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES NOT POSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M SORRY FOR STRETCHING OUT INTO THE LUNCH HOUR -- I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR IN THE COMMITTEE FOR TAKING THE AMENDMENTS -- MARCO GEORGE FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION WE'RE STILL IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. AND BASICALLY WE DON'T THINK IT MAKES SENSE. TO FINE PROSTITUTES TO FUND SERVICES FOR PROSTITUTES AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES -- IN THE MUNICIPAL COURT WHAT USED TO BE CALMING TO SUPPORT NOW SUPERIOR COURT -- IN OAKLAND WE DO NOT SEE ROGER CRAFT WE DO NOT SEE HI PRESS PRICE CALL GIRLS. WE SEE STREET PROSTITUTES. AND THOSE FOR THE MOST PART WOMEN SOME MEN. ARE LUCKY TO MAKE A HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A DAY. AND YES SERVICES ARE NEEDED -- FOR PROSTITUTES BUT BASICALLY THIS BILL. BECAUSE FINDS UNFORTUNATELY JUST BECOME ROUTINE THEY GET STAMPED INTO THE PROCESS AND FEES AND ASSESSMENTS GET SENT ON TOP OF THEM SO NOW THE MINIMUM FINE. IS FOR MISDEMEANORS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS PLUS FEES AND ASSESSMENTS BRINGS IT TO OVER TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS. IF THIS BILL IS ENACTED THE MAXIMUM FEES GOING TO BE TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND AS IT SAYS IN THE ANALYSIS WITH THE FINES AND FEES IT COULD WELL TOP EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS -- I DON'T THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE IN OAKLAND ARE GONNA BE FACED WITH AN EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FEE BUT I THINK THAT IT WILL BECOME ROUTINE TO SLAP ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS ON THE TWO HUNDRED EXISTING FEE. AND THAT THAT WILL MAKE IT A CHOICE FOR MY CLIENTS -- TO EITHER PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE OR PAY RENT OR PAY THE FINES AND WE ALREADY KNOW. FROM THE RESEARCH AND FROM COMMITTEE HEARINGS AND HEAR THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF TRYING -- TO FINANCE THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND SERVICES FOR VICTIMS ON THE BACKS OF THE INDIGENT. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS DOES SO WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR OPPOSITION AND ASK THAT YOU KEEP THE MONEY AND THE PROSTITUTES POCKETS THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION SORRY TO SAY I AM AT NO. THANK YOU. FOR ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YOU MAY CLOSE WAS CUNNINGHAM HAD ADDRESS THE POINTS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION MY CLOTHES PLEASE. THERE IS AN EXISTING FINE ALREADY IN LAW OFFERED FOR THIS OFFENSE -- SO WE'RE NOT CREATING A NEW FIND WE'RE CHANGING THE MAXIMUM CAP ON IT -- AND WERE RE PURPOSING THE MONEY TO A SPECIFIC PURPOSE ALONG THE LOCALS TO USE IT FOR THAT PURPOSE I TRY TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT SECONDLY. PRIMARILY WHAT WE'RE SEEKING TO DO IN THIS AND WITH THIS BILL IS TO GO AFTER JOHN'S AND IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THE DATA AND RESEARCH SOCIAL ECONOMICALLY THE JOHNS THE PEOPLE THAT ARE. DOING THE SOLICITING ARE ARE PRETTY SOCIO ECONOMICALLY WELL OFF PREDOMINATELY AS TO THIS PURPOSE. THE AND WE PUT EXPLICITLY IN THE BILL THAT A JUDGE CAN WAIVE THIS FINE ENTIRELY. DOWN TO ZERO BASED ON ABILITY INABILITY TO PAY THAT SPECIFICALLY IN THE BILL SO THIS GIVES US A TOOL TO TAKE MONEY FROM THE JOHNS. AND USE IT TO SUPPORT THE PEOPLE THEY'VE BEEN EXPORTING.
