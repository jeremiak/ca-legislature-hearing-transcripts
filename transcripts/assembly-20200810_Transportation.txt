TEN TWENTY FOUR TO THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS. A MESS OKAY THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR- THANK YOU SENATOR THE THING CARE SO I HEARD FROM THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT HOW THIS BILL HELPS MITIGATE THE ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE TO THESE VEHICLES DO CAN YOU EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THIS BILL ACCOMPLISHES MITIGATION- THE WAY I FIVE TO ME WAYS NOW UNDER THE RED STICKER PROGRAM IN HER CAR- YOU'RE NOT REQUIRED TO BE A COMPETITIVE RACER. AT TO WIRE THAT STICKER YOUR MORE SUBTLE SO THIS BILL BY. ACTUALLY ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE BILL IS THAT ANYBODY WHO REQUIRES THIS- STICKER FOR THEIR MORE CYCLE HAS TO SHOW THAT THEY ARE A MEMBER OF A- OF A LEGITIMATE RACING ORGANIZATION. SO IT'S THAT BRING THE MOTORCYCLES AND THE RACERS UNDER THE REGULATIONS OF THOSE RACING BODIES WHICH ARE. RECOGNIZES AS LEGITIMATE RACING- ORGANIZATIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WITHOUT THIS- SAYS NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO WITHOUT THIS BILL THERE THERE WILL BE NO PROGRAM TO REPLACE. MR PROGRAMS TO THE- POSTED BY THESE MORE CYCLES. LESS REGULATION AND- LESS REQUIREMENTS ON WHERE THEY ARE ALLOWED TO WEAR THEM AND WHETHER RIDE THEM AND WHERE THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO WRITE THEM. AND US C. H. P. BECAUSE THEY WILL BE REGISTERED WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO ENFORCE. OF THE PARTICULAR LAWS ON THAT HAVE THE STICKERS. SO IF I UNDERSTAND ME NOW SAYS THAT THE SUGAR PROGRAM WHICH IS NOW I THINK MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS OLD I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY WAS INTENDED TO BE. TEMPORARY IN NATURE AND THAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BRING ALL HOLES INTO THE GREEN STICKER PROGRAM AND ALLOW THEM TO OMIT LASSEN NEED THE EMISSIONS. UNDER THE CARPET. THIS BILL IS I DON'T KNOW IF I'M WRONG DOESN'T THAT IT MAKES THE REST OF THE PROGRAM BERMAN IS THAT RIGHT CRAIGMILLAR WELL AS- NOT THE RED TO. IT'S A DIFFERENT PROGRAM. I NEED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE VERY. CARE DEFY. BECAUSE RIGHT THE REGISTERED APPROACH IS MY MORE BROAD. THOSE COMMENTS MAY BE TRUE I I'M NOT SURE THAT IT WAS EVER INTENDED FOR THIS. TO COMPLETELY PHASE OUT OR NOT WHAT HAS WHAT WHAT I DO KNOW IS CARP. WASN'T INTERESTED IN CAN ME AND UNDER THEIR JERSEYS. AND AVERAGE MANY. FROM TODAY. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT SPUR AND HOW IN THIS OF. AND OUR LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE WITH SOME REGULATE AND I WHY ROOM INTO PART PARKS DEPARTMENT. AND THEN MY LAST RELATED TO GOING BACK TO MANY. IS THAT THE FOR THAT ARE. ON THE- STICKERS IF YOU WELL. AND GO WE ARE CONFINED TO A BED. SO STICKERS ARE ALLOW THE VEHICLES TO MORE THAN. OTHER VEHICLES RIGHT FOR THESE ARE AT THIS AND I THINK IF WE WERE TRYING TO MITIGATE THE EMISSION THAT THE FOR THAT WE ARE CO SHOULD GO INTO ACTUAL MITIGATION RATHER GO TO THE FUN THAT ALLOWED ADDITIONAL V. EXERC WHICH IS THE POOL. SO WHY ARE WE PUTTING THESE FUNDS TO DO AND IT IN PROGRAM THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO READ. WELL THAT IS. A QUESTION OF. I'M NOT SURE I HAVE. COMPLETE AFTER BUT I CAN YOU A PAR AND IN THE- IN THE PRO WE ARE GOING TO REQUIRE SPARK ARRESTORS IN THE MY WHICH DOES SOME OF THE DAMAGE. THAT THE VEHICLES CAN CAUSE WHEN THEY'RE RAN OFF ROADING BRUSHY AREA THIS PARKER. ANY THE SPARKS OUT THE EXHAUST. NOT A THEM TO GET IN THE BRUSH AND STARTED FIRE THAT. YOU WILL MEAN ALL A LOT OF EMISSION MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE FEAST THE IS A- PORTION OF THE FEE BROKE DOWN. IF HE IS ACTUALLY INCREASE AS WELL IT'S BEEN ADJUSTED FOR CPI SO ISN'T AND GIVE THE APART MORE TOOLS FOR THAT BUT I AM HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU YOUR SPUR MEDICAL. EFFORTS BECAUSE OF THE- THANK YOU AND I DO. THE SPARK NINE ONE THESE PARKS MY DISTRICT AND WE HAVE DO SO FROM FIRE. NOT IN FOR RESULT. RATHER THAN ALLOWING THE EXERCISE THE CONTINUES TO POLLUTE OUR ENVIRONMENT THANK. THANK YOU- ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SENIOR CENTER JOHNS IN CLOSING COMMENTS YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I DO WANT TO JUST MAKE SURE I SPECIFIC I WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY- TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE THEY DID A GREAT JOB OF.

I CENTER PLEASE PROCEED WHENEVER YOU'RE READY YEAH THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRDS. THIS BILL IS- S. B. THIRTEEN FIFTY ONE IT'S AN ECONOMIC STIMULUS BILL THERE CREATE JOBS PUT PEOPLE TO WORK- MY COLLEAGUES THE PANDEMIC- HAS IMPACTED THE STATE'S ECONOMY. AND THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IN MANY NEGATIVE WAVES THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMY IS CONTRACT. AND THE STATE IS EXPERIENCING A MAJOR DEFICIT MANY OF OUR RESIDENTS OF COURSE OF LOS DROPS. THIS BILL PROPOSES TO OPERATE PROJECTS IN THE APPROVED TWENTY TWENTY STATE HIGHWAY OPERATIONS AND PROTECTION PROGRAM. OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE SHOP BUT RAISING THE STATE TREASURER TO SELL BONDS THAT WOULD BE PAID BACK- BY THE STATE'S PORTION. OF THE TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT FEE UNDER SB ONE. THESE ARE REVENUE BONDS BY ACCELERATING THE SHOP PROJECTS THROUGH THESE REVENUE BONDS THE STATE WILL BE ABLE TO PUT PEOPLE TO WORK AND WELL PAYING SKILLED JOBS IN THE NEAR NEAR TERM. AND ALSO HELP US REACH SB ONE PERFORMANCE GOALS IN A SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME. LET ME TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ALSO INFORM THE COMMITTEE ON WHAT THE BILL DOES NOT DO. THE BILL DOES NOT AFFECT THE LOCAL SHARE OF SB ONE DOLLARS IN FACT THE BILL DOES NOT PHYSICALLY ON IMPACT ANY OTHER PROGRAM. FUNDED UNDER SB ONE. THIS BILL WILL NOT CONSUME THE ENTIRE PORTION. OF THE STATE'S ALLOCATION IN THE TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM OF CREEK PROGRAM. HOWEVER. RATHER ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF THE TIFF ALLOCATION WE'LL GO TO DEBT SERVICE. FOR EXAMPLE DEBT SERVICE ON A FIVE BILLION DOLLAR REVENUE BY WOULD BE THREE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR THE STATE'S THE STATE SHARE OF THE SB ONE DOLLARS WAS APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT ONE. BILLION DOLLARS FURTHER AS MY WITNESS WILL TESTIFY TODAY THE TIP IS THE MOST STABLE SB ONE REVENUE SOURCE IN TURN PROVIDING ENOUGH REVENUE TO COVER DEBT SERVICE AND CONTINUE FIGHTING ONGOING SHOP. AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS. ALSO WHAT THIS BILL DOES DO IS ACCELERATE THE SHOP PROJECTS. THAT WOULD BE FUNDED AND COMPLETED. FOUR YEARS FROM NOW TO BE COMPLETED IN TWO OR THREE YEARS IF NOT FASTER. BY PROVIDING THE FUNDS UNDER ORDER THEM RATHER THAN LATER. THIS WILL PUT PEOPLE BACK TO WORK AND WE NEED TO ACHIEVE OUR SB ONE PERFORMANCE GOALS AS WELL. S. B. THIRTEEN FIFTY ONE WILL HELP US ACCOMPLISH HIS GOALS I'D LIKE TO TURN OVER TO MY WITNESSES- TO PROVIDE YOU OF. TECNICO OF SUPPORT ABOUT THE FUN KAREN FILLED EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF FROM THE METADATA TRANSPORTATION IT INSTITUTE AND PROFESSOR. WALKS FROM UCLA'S TRANSPORTATION INSTITUTE THANK YOU THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NO VOTE. I THANK YOU CENTER I BELIEVE WE HAVE YOUR TWO WAYS IS VIA PHONE I WAS STUCK WITH IT WILL START WITH A DOCTOR PHILBRICK A MODERATOR PLEASE. OF HER TO SPEAK TESTIFIED. THANK YOU MY NAME IS DR KAREN AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE MINETA TRANSPORTATION INSTITUTE AT TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY. INFALLIBLY THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY TRANSPORTATION CONSORTIUM BLINDED BY THE ROAD AND COUNTY BILITY ACT OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. BEFORE I BEGIN I WOULD LIKE TO THANK SENATOR BELL FOR THE KIND OF EDUCATION TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY ON BEHALF OF THE TRANSPORTATION AND- THE MONEY ADDRESSES THE POTENTIAL FOR JOB CREATION IT REHABILITATION AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT. GENOCIDE IN THE STATE HIGHWAY OPERATION AND PROTECTION PROGRAM R. XCELERATED. PROJECTS IDENTIFIED AND ADOPTED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY SHOT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE JOBS WHILE THE ECONOMY IS DEPRESSED AND UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS ARE HIGH HIGHER THAN THEY HAVE BEEN IN OVER A DECADE WITH APPROXIMATELY 15% OF CALIFORNIANS OUT OF WORK. JOB CREATION MORE OF THE WAYS ATTRACT NOT THE ECONOMIC. OF TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENT. ESTIMATES FROM THE NITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION INDICATE THAT APPROXIMATELY THIRTEEN THOUSAND JOBS ARE CREATED FOR ONE BILLION DOLLARS INVESTED. THIS IS DEEMED A MULTIPLIER AT THE MINUTE AND IT'S DESIGNED TO CAPTURE DIRECT EFFECT. YEAH ALL THE SHOPPING FREE. INDIRECT BACK DOES THAT THE PLIGHT CHAIN EMPLOYEE OPPORTUNITY AND FINALLY ENDED UP BACK. JOHN THAT ARISE WHEN EMPLOYEES SPEND THOSE HARD EARNED. THERE ARE MANY THAT AT THE NET BUT YOU'RE IN BY THE COST OF LABOR. HELLO AND LYFT WHICH DO NOT REMAIN CONSTANT. THAT YES XCELERATED SHOP PROGRAMS ALSO HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO SAVE TAXPAYER DOLLARS BECAUSE MAINTENANCE COSTS ARE OFTEN MORE EXPENSIVE FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS INCLUDING INCREASED CONSTRUCTION COSTS AND COMPETITION IN THE LABOR MARKET WHEN THE ECONOMY IS. EIGHTY NEEDS REPAIRED NOW A WIDE INVESTMENT THAT WILL CREATE JOBS WHILE POTENTIALLY SAVING CALIFORNIA DRIVERS MONEY AT THE DATA SUGGESTS THAT MOTORISTS SPEND IN EXCESS OF A HUNDRED DOLLARS AND- AN EXTRA MAKE. TERRIBLE FIXING SUCH THINGS THE BROKEN AXLE AND COMPROMISE SHOCK ABSORBERS THAT RESULT IN DRIVING ON ROADS IN THE STATE OF DISREPAIR. THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ENGINEERS GAVE OUR STATE THROWS A LETTER GRADE AND BE IN CALIFORNIA SURFACE TRANSPORTATION TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN REPORT CARD. OUR INFRASTRUCTURE THE NEED A SUBSTANTIAL REHABILITATION AND CALIFORNIANS ARE IN NEED OF JOHN. MAKING AN INVESTMENT AND A SHOVEL READY PROJECT NOW WILL POTENTIALLY PROVIDE AN IMMEDIATE ECONOMIC STIMULUS. CREATING KILL JOBS QUICKLY EIGHTEEN UNEMPLOYMENT AND PROVIDING CALIFORNIA MOTORISTS WHICH REHABILITATED BROWN. IN CONCLUSION TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS CAN IMPROVE EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY WHILE CREATING EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND CONTRIBUTING TO CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY. REVENUE RAISED IN THE YEARS TO SENATE BILL THIRTEEN FIFTY ONE WILL CREATE JOBS WHILE IMPROVING THE MOBILITY OF PEOPLE AND GOODS IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I BELIEVE THE NEXT WITNESS- THE DOCTOR WALKS IS ALSO VIA PHONE. THE MODERATOR PLEASE HERE YES PLEASE PROCEED CAN YOU HEAR ME YES. OKAY YOU DID EVERYBODY GET A HANDOUT HI I'D LIKE TO KNOW THAT WOULD DYE CAN REFER TO IT. LEAVE SEVERAL BASS AND EVERYONE GETS IT IF NOT PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY SO MY NAME IS MARTIN WAX I'M A PROFESSOR EMERITUS OF CIVIL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND CITY AND REGIONAL PLANNING FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. I'M THE FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE UNIVERSE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION CENTER. I STUDY TRANSPORTATION REVENUE AND FINANCING CALIFORNIA FOR FIVE DECADES. AND THAT INCLUDES STUDIES OF THE TEXT- THE NEW TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT FEE. I'D LIKE TO THANK SENATOR. TO THE KIND INVITATION TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY ON BEHALF OF THE UC IDEAS AND THE MINETA TRANSPORTATION INSTITUTE HOW FIRST ADDRESS TO PROTECT BENEFITS OF ISSUING REVENUE BONDS. THAT WOULD ENABLE ACCELERATING TRANSPORTATION MAINTENANCE AND REHAB PROJECTS INCLUDED IN THE SHOP. I'LL ALSO COMMENT ON THE ABILITY OF THE CHANCE TO PRODUCE SUFFICIENT REVENUE TO REPEAT THE BOND. THERE ARE THREE REASONS THAT RAISING REVENUE IN THE COMING YEARS MAYBE WORTH UNDERTAKING RIGHT NOW. FIRST IT WOULD ENABLE THE STATE TO ACCELERATE SPENDING ON PROJECTS FEDERAL READY INCLUDED A SHOP. WHAT THE ECONOMY IS DEPRESSED AND CONSTRUCTION COSTS ARE LIKELY TO BE LOW BECAUSE OF A HIGH LEVEL OF COMPETITION. AMONG THE CURRENT. CHECK IN WELL WHAT THE STATE TO ISSUE REVENUE BONDS WHEN INTEREST RATES ARE RELATIVELY LOW. AND THEY'RE BACKED BY A C. LEVY ON EVERY REGISTERED VEHICLE IN CALIFORNIA IN THE ANNUAL FEE THAT RANGES FROM TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS TO A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS. DEPENDING ON THE VALUE OF THE VEHICLES AND THAT VALUES INGESTED ANNUALLY FOR INFLATION. AND THIRD WHILE REVENUE GENERATED BY THE CHIEF IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WITH PRECISION. IN MY OPINION IT WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO JUSTIFY THE ISSUANCE OF THE REVENUE BONDS AT A LEVEL THAT CAN FINALLY MANY OF THESE PROJECTS. DO REVENUE CAN'T BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY BECAUSE VEHICLE PURCHASES AND THE COMPOSITION OF THE STATE'S FLEET OF PRIVATELY OWNED VEHICLES WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE DEATHS OF THE CURRENT ECONOMIC DEPRESSION. AND THE PACE OF RECOVERY. ANNOTATION PATTERNS OF AUTOMOBILE PURCHASES DURING A PERIOD OF UNCERTAINTY. AND WHETHER THERE WOULD BE VEHICLE PURCHASE INCENTIVES THAT COULD BE IMPACTED BY THIS LEGISLATURE AS PART OF THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY PACKAGE. THE STATE OF THE RICH DIVERSITY BUT EVEN CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATES OF THE TEST. EVEN IN A SITUATION OF CERTAINTY SUGGEST STATE AND. STREET PRIOR TO THE- ECONOMIC DATA. WOOD COLD WATERS PROFESSOR ASHA GROW ALL THE MAIN ENTRANCE INSTITUTE AT SAN JOSE STATE AND HANNAH KING FROM UCLA I PARTICIPATED IN THE STUDY THAT ESTIMATED TRIP REVENUE BETWEEN TWENTY EIGHT AND TWENTY FORTY UNDER A RANGE OF WHAT TENDS AND UNCONTROVERSIAL ASSUMPTIONS- AND- ONE THE BIG FACTORS IS HOW MANY. IN THE FLEET WILL BE ELECTRIC VEHICLES. DEPENDS UPON THE VALUE OF THE VEHICLE AND ELECTRIC VEHICLES TEND TO BE TAPPED HIGH VALUE. WE ESTIMATE THAT ANNUAL REVENUE FROM THE TEST WOULD INCREASE STEADILY TO TWENTY FORTY IT WOULD BE ABOUT A BILLION POINT FIVE BILLION THAT HAPPENED THIS YEAR TO- TWO AND A HALF BILLION AND REALLY- BY TWENTY FORTY- AND OBVIOUSLY. THE CATASTROPHIC ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE COLD WITH NINETEEN- WILL AFFECT THAT SO IN MAY WE PUBLISHED A PEER REVIEWED UPDATE OF OUR EARLIER PROJECTIONS IN LIGHT OF COVERT NINETEEN. AND WE AGAIN ESTIMATES THAT BY TWENTY THIRTY THE END OF THE REVENUE COULD BE BELOW BUT CLOSE TO TWO BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. DEPENDING ON HOW QUICKLY BOUNCED BACK. WE ARE NOW. BEGINNING A ROUND OF. WITH NEW THAT'S ABOUT. THE ECONOMIC PACE OF RECOVERY. STILL THE SUBSTANTIAL BENEFITS TO TRAVELERS AND WORKERS OF A STABLE INVESTMENT PROGRAM IN HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE REHABILITATION AND IMPROVEMENT UNDER FAVORABLE CONTRACT PRICES AND INTEREST RATES HAVE TO BE BALANCED AGAINST THE RISK OF LOWER TAX REVENUES AND WE MIGHT HOPE FOR. BUT OUR PROJECTIONS- THAT WERE MADE A FEW MONTHS AGO BASED ON MANY ASSUMPTIONS ARE BEING REVISITED AND INDICATE THAT G. REVENUE WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THIS BOND PROGRAM. INCLUDE I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO KNOW TO STATE ECONOMIC RECOVERY STIMULUS MEASURE IT COULD BE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED. BENEFIT FROM LOCATION V. AS- REVENUE STREAM. COULD TO THIS YOU ACT GOAL THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE AVERAGE TO.
