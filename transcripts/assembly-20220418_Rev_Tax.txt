FINALLY I WISH TO ANNOUNCE THAT FILE ITEM FOR AB TWENTY EIGHTEEN HAS BEEN PULLED BY THE AUTHOR. YOU ALREADY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG. WE HAVE PRESENT PRESENTING- TWENTY EIGHT TO THIRTY FIVE AB. ATTESTING TO ALL RIGHT. HOPEFULLY THEY'LL BE NO ONE WITH SUPER GLUE THIS TIME AROUND- SINCE LAST TIME I SAID THIS YEAR- I THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS. A BLOOD DONATION SAVED COUNTLESS LIVES ACROSS THE STATE AND NATION ACCORDING TO THE BLOOD CENTERS OF CALIFORNIA SOMEONE NEEDS A BLOOD TRANSFUSION EVERY THREE SECONDS AND BLOOD BANKS ARE RUNNING DANGEROUSLY LOW ON SUPPLIES. THIS BILL AB TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY FIVE WOULD EXEMPT BLOOD BANKS FROM SALES AND USE TAXES TO HELP THEM RAMP UP COLLECTION TO MEET THE INCREASED DEMAND FOR BLOOD PRODUCTS AND MISS A NATIONAL BLOOD SHORTAGE DONATED BLOOD PRODUCTS ARE USED TO TREAT INJURIES AND DISEASES RANGING FROM CANCER HEART DISEASE ORGAN TRANSPLANTS TO SEVERE TRAUMATIC INJURIES. IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT WE RELY ON THE KINDNESS AND GENEROSITY OF BLOOD DONORS TO HELP SAVE SECOND GLOBAL CALIFORNIANS EVERY DAY BUT THE PANDEMIC HAS TRIPLED OUR BLOOD SUPPLY AND HOSPITALS ARE IN DESPERATE NEED OF WHOLE BLOOD AND BLOOD COMPONENTS. EARLIER THIS YEAR A TRAUMA CENTER IN LOS ANGELES HAD TO TEMPORARILY CLOSE BECAUSE OF INADEQUATE BLOOD SUPPLY. CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE FEW STATES. THAT REQUIRE THEIR NONPROFIT BLOOD CENTERS TO PAY SALES AND USE TAXES. IN LIGHT OF THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC IN THE STALL OF ELECTIVE SURGERIES DEMAND FOR THAT PRODUCT TO INCREASE AND NONPROFIT BLOOD CENTERS CAN RISE TO MEET THAT DEMAND. BY PROVIDING TAX RELIEF TO BLOOD DONATION CENTERS FINANCIAL RESOURCES CAN BE FREED UP. FOR THEM TO BE FLEXIBLE SOLICIT DONORS AND RAISE AWARENESS OF THE SHORT ASIAN AND HAVE UPCOMING BUT- LET'S DRIVES. WHAT THE LEGISLATURE. HAS GRANTED SALES AND USE TAX EXEMPTIONS AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS IN THE PAST. WITHOUT PROVIDING REIMBURSEMENT TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS I AM SENSITIVE TO THE POSITION OF CITIES AND COUNTIES SO I PREPARED AMENDMENTS TO REIMBURSE THEM. FOR THE LOCAL PIECE OF SALES AND USE TAXES. AS A NODE AS NOTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS I'M ALSO OPEN TO NARROWING THE SCOPE OF THE BILL TO REDUCE THE FISCAL IMPACT OF THE STATE. I'M JOINED BY LYDIA BORN ON BEHALF OF THE BLOOD CENTERS OF CALIFORNIA I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. ABOUT. GOOD AFTERNOON OF THE ONE REPRESENTING THE BLOOD CENTERS OF CALIFORNIA WITH SUPPORT FROM THE NINE. OKAY NOT A NONPROFIT COMMUNITY BASED BLOOD CENTER COALITION MEMBERS. BCC MEMBERS PROVIDE OVER 90% OF THE BLOOD AND BLOOD PRODUCTS. REQUIRED IN CALIFORNIA. WE ARE HIGHLY REGULATED INDUSTRY. THE F. D. A. N. A. A. B. B. WHICH IS TO. SHORTED FOR THE ASSOCIATION FOR ADVANCEMENT OF BLOOD IN BIO THERAPIES GOVERN OUR OPERATIONS AND ANY STANDARDS GENERATED BY THE A. A. B. B. BECOME LAW IN CALIFORNIA AFTER A NINETY DAY WAITING PERIOD- WE ASSURE THE SAFETY OF THE BLOOD SUPPLY BY COLLECTING FROM AN ALL VOLUNTEER. DONOR BASE THE BLOOD SUPPLY IS THE SAFEST THERE'S EVER BEEN. BASED ON THE SALES AND USE TAX EXEMPTIONS ALLOWED FOR NON PROFITS INCLUDING ONE OF OUR LARGEST BLOOD CENTERS AMERICAN RED CROSS WE ARE SEEKING PARITY. WE DO HAVE A LIMITED EXEMPTION FROM SALES AND USE TAX ON CONTAINERS OF BLOOD PLASMA AND BLOOD DERIVATIVES INCLUDING THE TUBING FILTERS AND NEEDLES HOWEVER. THERE ARE OTHER SUPPLIES THAT INCREASE COSTS SUCH AS BLOOD SCREENING TESTS AS WELL AS THE REAGENTS EQUIPMENT AND OTHER SUPPLIES THESE COST INCREASE OUR DELIVERY OF THIS VALUABLE COMMUNITY SERVICE. MULTIPLE OTHER STATES TOTAL EXEMPT THEIR BLOOD CENTERS FROM SALES TAXES WHEN PURCHASING SUCH SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT. THE TAX EXEMPTION WE REQUEST WILL FREE UP DOLLARS THAT COULD BETTER BE SPENT ON EDUCATING THE PUBLIC ABOUT BLOOD ISSUES RECRUITING AND RETAINING DONORS. INCREASING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS AND CONTINUING TO ASSURE THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF THE BLOOD SUPPLY FOR THESE ABOVE RISK REASONS WE ARE IN SUPPORT AND ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE WHEN THIS ISSUE. IS CONSIDERED FOR ABOUT. THANK YOU AND ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. YOU ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES THAT WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. ANY OTHER SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION IN THE ROOM. ALL RIGHT- DO WE HAVE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. AND I JUST HAVE OF ONE QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG- WITH THIS ALLOW BLOOD BANKS TO PURCHASE ANY SORT OF EQUIPMENT PROPERTY TAX FREE. WELL I WOULD DOUBLE TO FERTILITY BUT WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE- ENVISIONED IT TO BE- FOR SPECIFIC- QUITMAN BUT- AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE ON IF IT THAT SOMETHING THAT THE COMMITTEE IS WHY TO SPECIFY IN TERMS OF ALLOWING. SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT TO GET IT BUT- YOU KNOW WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT THE FACT THAT FOR EVERY HUNDRED DOLLARS SPENT BY SOME BLOOD CENTERS TO SEVEN TO TEN DOLLARS WOULD BE SAVED IF THEY COULD GET A SALES TAX USE EXEMPTION OF. RIGHT ACTION AND TO- JUST TO ADD A LITTLE OUT WE ARE WORKING WITH THE US ONLY MEANT TO KIND OF COME UP WITH A LIST TO TRY TO NARROW IT DOWN SOMEWHAT BUT PRIMARILY MOST OF IT'LL BE RELATED TO THE- EVALUATION OF THE BLOOD THAT COMES IN I THINK YOU WILL AS I STATED- WITH THE BLOOD SUPPLY IS THE SAFEST IT'S EVER BEEN. ARE THERE ARE ELEVEN TESTS THAT WE HAVE TO. ADMINISTER TO ANY BLOOD THAT COMES IN AND WHILE IT'S- IT'S NOT REALLY MANDATE IT BUT THE FDA. SAYS THAT WE SHOULD DO THIS AND CLEARLY IT MAKES SENSE IN TERMS OF THE BLOOD SUPPLY BEING SAFE BUT THAT'S WHAT COST US IS ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS ADD TO THE COST OF PROVIDING BLOOD AND BLOOD PRODUCTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ALL RIGHT YEAH THANK YOU ARE THE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE- I. RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL THANK YOU AND- I AM GOING TO. PASS THE GAVEL OVER TO OF. MY VICE CHAIR AND- WILL MEET. OUR TREASURE. WE WILL. RIGHT AND- WE NOW MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBERONE AB TWO TWO ONE SIX TEEN. WELL AB TWO TO SIXTEEN AT ONE SIXTEEN. RIGHT. MADAM CHAIR PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. ALL RIGHT NOT A VICE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS IN TWENTY FIFTEEN I AUTHORED AB FOUR FOUR NINE ESTABLISHING THE CAL ABLE ACT WHICH ALLOWS INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH DISABILITIES TO SAVE MONEY WITHOUT FEAR OF LOSING THEIR NEEDED PUBLIC BENEFITS. AB TWENTY TWO SIXTEEN WILL PROVIDE STATU TORY UPDATES THE CALABAR TO BETTER ALIGN WITH THE FEDERAL ABLE ACT AND THE IRS REGULATIONS FOR ABLE ACCOUNTS WITH THESE CHANGES THE STATE WILL ENSURE THAT THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF THE CALLEVA PROGRAM FURTHER SUPPORT CALIFORNIANS WITH A LIVING WITH DISABILITIES I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY MY FIFTH OR SO- CAL ABLE BILL AND SO ALWAYS HAPPY TO PARTNER WITH YOU- I'D LIKE TO- OF- R. AS STATE TREASURER. FIONA MA AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE KELLY WILL PROGRAM DANTE ALAN. GIVE US SOME SPEAKING POINTS THANK YOU THANK YOU MEMBERS- GREAT TO SEE EVERYONE HERE TODAY AND I WANT TO THANK- SALUTE NUMBER IRWIN FOR HER LEADERSHIP IN A STAB WISHING THIS VERY VERY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM- I JUST GOT ELECTED THREE AND A HALF YEARS AGO AND SO THIS STARTED UNDER MY PREDECESSOR JOHN CHUNG. AND IT'S GREAT TO SEE NOW TODAY THAT CALIFORNIA HAS THE FOURTH LARGEST ABLE PROGRAM IN THE COUNTRY SO THIS PROGRAM IS ENABLING MORE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES DIAGNOSED BEFORE THE AGE OF TWENTY SIX TO OPEN UP ACCOUNTS AND SAVE UP TO SIXTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN THEIR OWN NAME OUT WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING ANY OF THE OTHER SAFETY NET BENEFITS THAT THEY DEPEND ON. THIS BILL IS REALLY KIND OF A TECHNICAL CLEAN UP BILL- FOR TWO THINGS IN PARTICULAR NUMBER ONE IT INCLUDES LANGUAGE TO GRANDFATHER IN THOSE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WHO OPENED ABLE ACCOUNTS AND OTHER STATES. IN GOOD FAITH TO AVOID UNINTENDED ADVERSE AFFECTS YOU ANY CURRENT HOLDERS SINCE PEOPLE DO MOVE FROM STATE TO STATE- IF THEY COME TO CALIFORNIA THEY WILL BE ABLE TO. MOVE THEIR MONEY INTO CAL CALIFORNIA'S CAL ABLE ACCOUNT WITHOUT- JEOPARDIZING THEIR ACCOUNT AND THE BENEFITS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN RECEIVING AND THE SECOND IS TO CONFORM WITH THE FEDERAL IRS TAX REGULATIONS- WHICH ENABLE PARTICIPANTS WHO ARE WORKING AND NOT ACTIVELY PARTICIPATING IN AN EMPLOYER SPONSORED RETIREMENT PROGRAM TO CONTRIBUTE ABOVE THE ANNUAL IRS GIFT TAX EXEMPTION CONTRIBUTION LIMIT OF THE ABLE PROGRAM- SO AGAIN THIS PROGRAM IS WORKING WE ARE WORKING. UP IN CONGRESS TO EXPAND THE AGE OF ELIGIBILITY FOR DISABILITY TO FORTY SIX YEARS OLD BECAUSE WE KNOW PEOPLE- HAVE UNEXPECTED ILLNESSES AND ACCIDENTS AFTER THEIR TWENTY SIX YEARS OLD THIS WOULD ENABLE SEVEN MILLION MORE. AMERICANS TO PARTICIPATE. INCLUDING ONE MILLION VETERANS ARE SO WE REALLY AS IT IS MOVING IN A BIPARTISAN MANNER THROUGH CONGRESS AS WE SPEAK. AND I WANT TO THANK THE LEADERSHIP OF DANTE ALLEN ARE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WHO'S BEEN HERE SINCE DAY ONE. OF FOR HIS LEADERSHIP. AND BEING REALLY THE EXPERT ONE OF THE EXPERTS IN THE COUNTRY- ARE ABLE PROGRAM SO THANK YOU DANTE THANK YOU TREASURE MA. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER IRWIN THE ONLY THING THAT I WOULD ADD TO THAT IS ONE OF THE- CONFUSING CONFUSING MEASURES OF. THE FEDERAL ABLE ACT WAS THIS IDEA OF MEDICAID RECOVERY. IT ALLOWS MEDICAID TO REIMBURSE ITSELF USING MONEY FROM INDIVIDUALS ABLE ACCOUNTWHEN THEY PASSED AWAY. CALIFORNIA WE HAD THE FORESIGHT EVEN BOAST FOR CALAIS BOTH- WAS FULLY UP AND RUNNING. TO PASS A LAW THAT SAID THAT- MEDIC COW WILL NOT DO THAT FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS- THERE WAS A- A NEW ONCE IN THE LAW THAT THAT IT SAID FOR ABLE ACCOUNT HOLDERS. AND WE SEE THAT THE MOST APPROPRIATE USE FOR THAT WOULD BE TO PROMOTE OUR STATE PROGRAM THE CALIBER PROGRAM RATHER THAN ABLE PROGRAMS FROM ALL OVER THE NATION. AND PARTICIPATING IN OUR PROGRAM AND RECEIVING THAT PROTECTION- THAT LIMITS MEDICARE'S ABILITY TO RECOVER. THANK YOUARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. SEEN THAT ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. QUESTIONS ARE COMING FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THERE'S OF A SEVEN MEMBER MADAM CHAIR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE WELL WHEN WE HAVE- ACTUALLY EVERYBODY HERE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND THANK YOU TO BOTH OF YOU FOR ALL THE HARD WORK OVER THE YEARS ON THIS ISSUE IT IS IT IS REALLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I HEAR ABOUT MOST WHEN I TALK TO PARENTS- THAT HAVE- DISABLED CHILDREN IN MY COMMUNITY IT IT IT HAS MADE A HUGE IMPACT. RIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU MEMBERS. RIGHT SO OUR NEXT ITEM IS FILE ITEM NUMBER TWO. AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL SOON GET TO OUR FULL ATTENDANCE BUT RIGHT NOW YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY- PRESENTING TO SUBCOMMITTEE SO AB TWENTY SEVEN NINE SEVEN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND DEATH GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS I AM HERE. TODAY TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY SEVEN NINETY SEVEN THIS BILL WILL HELP CALIFORNIA REACH ITS CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS BY INCENTIVIZING INCREASED PRODUCTION AND USE OF VERY LOW TO CARBON NEUTRAL TRANSPORTATION FUELS AS WE ALL KNOW WE ARE IN A CLIMATE CRISIS AND DIESEL CONTINUES TO DOMINATE THE HEAVY DUTY TRANSPORTATION SECTOR DIESEL POWERED HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS ARE THE SINGLE LARGEST SOURCE OF. SMOG FORMING POLLUTION AND TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS IN CALIFORNIA ARE WE CERTAINLY NEED MORE POLICY TOOLS IN ORDER TO HELP SUPPORT THE DECARBONISATION OF FUELS AB TWENTY SEVEN NINETY SEVEN WOULD COMPLEMENT OUR EXISTING LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD BY OFFERING ADDITIONAL INCENTIVES FOR THE TRANSITION AWAY FROM HIGH CARBON FUELS I'M NOW PLEASED TO INTRODUCE TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES A BILL MCGOVERN MCGOVERN FROM THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR. AND PATRICK CANNING FROM THE COALITION FOR RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS. THANKS VERY MUCH MANAGER COMMITTEE MEMBERS BILL MCGOVERN WITH THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR IN SUPPORT- IT AS THE AUTHOR STATED TRANSPORTATION IS THE BIGGEST SOURCE OF AIR POLLUTION AND CLIMATE. CAUSING EMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA AND- WE TALK IN REDUCING TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS WE TALK ABOUT THREE. VARIOUS WAYS TO DO IT ONE IS TO CLEAN UP THE ENGINES IN THE VEHICLES ANOTHER IS TO REDUCE THE MILES TRAVELED BY THE VEHICLES. AND THE OTHER ONE WHICH THIS BILL ADDRESSES IS TO CLEAN UP THE FUELS IN OUR VEHICLES AND CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A LEADER IN DOING THAT- AS THE AUTHOR MENTIONED WE HAVE THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD WHICH IS STARTING TO HAVE SOME MAJOR SUCCESS. IN INTRODUCING ALTERNATIVES TO PETROLEUM BASED FUELS AND THIS BILL AS SHE SAID WOULD REALLY BUILD ON THAT SUCCESS AND USE THAT STANDARD AS A METRIC. TO PROVIDE INCENTIVES BECAUSE WE KNOW WE NEED TO DO MORE EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE DOING MORE THAN OTHER STATES RIGHT NOW STILL NOT NEARLY ENOUGH IF YOU LOOK AT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE CRISES PRESENTED BY BOTH AIR POLLUTION. AND CLIMATE CHANGE SO THIS BILL I THINK TAKES A VERY SENSIBLE APPROACH IN INCENTIVIZING THE VERY CLEANEST LOW CARBON FUELS FOR SIX YEARS SO WILL HAVE A TRANSITION UNDER WAY TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AND MY ORGANIZATION ADVOCATES FOR THAT ALL THE TIME BUT WE KNOW THAT WHILE THE TRANSITION IS UNDER WAY. WE WILL HAVE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF VEHICLES ON OUR ROADS BURNING COMBUSTION FUELS AND WE WANT THOSE FUELS TO BE AS CLEAN AS POSSIBLE THAT'S WHY WE SUPPORT THIS BILL. HOW TO GET IN WITH THE COALITION FOR RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS OUR MEMBERSHIP IS MADE UP OF CITIES COUNTIES. UNIVERSITIES LABOR UNIONS AND COMPANIES THAT PROVIDE FOR- MORE THAN 95% OF THE RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS IN THE UNITED STATES- CALIFORNIA'S BAN A WORLD LEADER WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE CHANGE. BUT WE'VE ALSO BEEN VICTIM TO THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE WHETHER IT'S DROUGHTS WILDFIRES TO CONTINUE ABOVE AVERAGE TEMPERATURE- IN OUR STATE- AND WE KEEP TACKLING THIS ISSUE HEAD ON BY COMMITTING TO REDUCING NATURAL GAS TO REMISSIONS. COSTLY SEEKING NEW WAYS IN LARGE PART THIS BILL IS- TWENTY SEVEN NINETY SEVEN IS A RESPONSE TO- THE SPEAKERS CALLED THE PROTON THE GOVERNOR ALL SAYING THAT WE NEED TO. DOUBLE DOWN AND PUT MORE RESOURCE- TO COMBATING CLIMATE CHANGE AND OUR STATE- AND IN OUR COUNTRY. FOR THESE REASONS AND OTHERS WERE FULL SUPPORT OF TWENTY SEVEN NINETY SEVEN THANK. RIGHT TO US THANK YOU DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU PRESTON YOUNG FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON TODD CAMPBELL REPRESENTING THE BIOENERGY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA AND THE CALIFORNIA CHESTER COALITION IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON RYAN KENNY WITH CLEAN ENERGY IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. PAUL WOODS WITH CALIFORNIA ADVISORS ON BEHALF OF BIOENERGY INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. ALL RIGHT- DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. WE HAVE- COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER COURT. SO IN THE ANALYSIS- IT SAYS THAT THEY DON'T THINK THERE'S REALLY A SHORTAGE OF SUPPLIERS SURGED PORTAGE SHORTAGE OF USERS. SO WHY AND THAT MOST OF THE RESULT OF THIS WILL GO TO CURRENT SUPPLIERS. THIS DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE TO ME. ARM I COULD SEE A GRANT PROGRAM. TO GET MAYBE NEW SUPPLIERS ON IF THERE'S SOME BARRIER TO ENTRY AND THERE'S EVIDENCE OF THAT- MIGHT MAKE MORE SENSE TO SIMPLY DO SUBSIDIZE THE- PURCHASE OF- ALTERNATIVE ENERGY VEHICLES. SO WHY USE THIS APPROACH. AND THANK YOU FOR THAT THAT QUESTION ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRK AT SU THE AS PRIMARY DRIVER FOR WHY DIESEL REMAINS THE DOMINANT FUEL IN THE HEAVY DUTY TRANSPORTATION FACTS SECTOR IS COST AND THE REALITY IS WE ARE NOT EVER GOING TO GET TO A POINT WHERE. THESE FIVE IT CLEANER FUELS ARE COST NEUTRAL WITH DIESEL WE'RE JUST NOT AND SO BY PROVIDING THIS AS AN INCENTIVE TO SUPPLIERS THE EXPECTATION AND THE GOAL IS IT THEN THAT CAN CREATE MORE ELEVEN LEVEL PLAYING FIELD WITH THE PRICING OF DIESEL AND THAT. IF YOU SAID THAT THE IF THE CHALLENGE RIGHT NOW IS WITH DEMAND WE'VE GOT TO MANAGE TO LOWER THE PRICE FOR THESE FUEL SO THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY BE COST COMPETITIVE WITH DIESEL AND WELCOME WITH MY WHAT ABOUT WHEN AT ANYTHING TO THAT- LET ME JUST SAY. GANYMEDE ANALYSIS PRICES SET BY SUPPLY AND DEMAND. WE'VE DISCUSSED FOR EXAMPLE SUSPENDING THE GAS TAX AND PEOPLE SAID. WHO'S YOU KNOW PRICES SET BY SUPPLY AND DEMAND THERE'S NO GUARANTEE FIVE A HYDROGEN VEHICLE. AND AS A CUSTOMER R. I GET A DIRECT BENEFIT ACTUALLY FULL FUEL IS FREE BUT ONE CAN IMAGINE A CASE. WHERE ARM YOU KNOW IT'S NOT FREE BUT IT'S AT A REDUCED PRICE BUT AGAIN I'M VERY. SKEPTICAL THAT THE PRICE WILL ACTUALLY CHANGE BECAUSE YOU'RE GIVING MONEY TO THE PRODUCERS BECAUSE IT'S THE PRICE IS NOT BASED ON PRODUCTION COST. BASED ON SUPPLY AND DEMAND THAT'S WEIGHED MARKETS WORK THAT'S FRESHMAN ECONOMICS IN COLLEGE. CORRECT THOUGH IN THIS CASE IT I GUESS THAT ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I DEMAND IS. IS AS LOW AS IT IS BECAUSE OF THE PRICE SO IN ORDER TO IMPACT. THE PAST DEMAND SIDE WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE PRICE ELEMENT AND I THINK THAT- I THINK THAT THE REALITY AS WE ARE MOVING TOWARDS OUR- GOAL OF CARBON NEUTRALITY HERE IN THE STATE AND ALL AND ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. IS THAT AS WE ARE MAKING GOOD PROGRESS HERE IS CALIFORNIA. UP ON LOWERING DEMAND FOR GAS THAT'S ACTUALLY GOOD BECAUSE- THE PRICE POINT OF THESE LOWER CAR OF THESE HIGHER CARBON FUELS TO ACTUALLY GO DOWN AND SO WE HAVE TO FIND SOME WAYS TO IMPACT THAT IF WE ACTUALLY WANT. TO THEN BE ABLE TO MOVE THE NEEDLE ON KIND OF A GLOBAL SCALE MY ARGUMENT IS A BONY IMPACTED BECAUSE THE PRICE IS GOING TO BE SPENT BY APPLIANCE SUPPLY AND DEMAND. SO WAY IT'S ALWAYS SAID. UNLESS YOU MAKE A DIFFERENT KIND OF MARKET INTERVENTION THIS ISN'T GOING TO WORK. THAT'S MY AND THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT THE ANALYSIS SAYS IN THAT SECTION. ASSEMBLY MAN I WOULD JUST ADD YOU KNOW PARTICULAR YOURSELF WITH A HYDROGEN CAR WE HAVE AN ABUNDANCE OF HYDROGEN THE COST FOR HYDROGEN IS ACTUALLY IN THE ROOM THE- TECHNOLOGY THE INNOVATION THAT COMES IN THE LARGE PART. WITH THIS BILL WILL DO IS HELP INCENTIVIZE THAT INNOVATION SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO GET THE FUEL SOURCE DIFFERENT FROM. SOME OF THE FUEL SOURCES THAT WE HAVE THAT ARE ON MORE OF A SCARCITY MODEL AS YOU TALK ABOUT. THINGS LIKE HYDROGEN THINGS LIKE SOME OF THESE OTHER ALTERNATIVE FUELS- RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS THE PROBLEM WITH HYDROGEN IS THERE ISN'T ENOUGH SUPPLY. AND THE BEST WAY TO SOLVE THAT WOULD BE FOR THE STATE TO INVEST IN GETTING A LARGER SUPPLY WHICH WOULD THEN BRING DOWN THE PRICE. BUT JUST GIVING MONEY TO PRODUCERS I DON'T THINK CHANGES THE PRICE THAT'S AGAIN THE ARGUMENT IN THE ANALYSIS AND I AGREE WITH THAT. THE BETTER THING TO DO IF THERE'S REALLY IF IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE AND WHAT YOU WANT IS. INNOVATION THEN SUBSIDIZE THE INNOVATION. SUBSIDIZE SAY GOING TO A LARGER SCALE THAT WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR HYDROGEN. WHICH I KNOW QUITE WELL. THEIR BIG PROBLEM IS YOU REALLY. HAVE A HUGE CAPITAL INVESTMENT. YOU CAN LOWER THE COST BY GOING TO HIGHER SCALE SO IF YOU WANT TO BRING DOWN THE PRICE OF HYDROGEN IT WOULD BE TO SUBSIDIZE A VERY LARGE PLANT WHICH COULD RUN TWENTY FOUR SEVEN. AND THUS GET YOUR COMPLETE CAPITAL- PAID FOR BECAUSE IT'S RUNNING TWENTY FOUR SEVEN. THAT WOULD BE A WAY TO REDUCE SUPPLIES HYDROGEN. GIVING WE HAVE HAD THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE HYDROGEN STATIONS COME HERE REPEATEDLY TO ASK FOR TAX BREAK. AND I'VE OPPOSED IT. I'M SORRY THIS IS JUST ISN'T GOING TO WORK. AND UNFORTUNATELY I THINK THAT'S THE SAME WITH THIS. RIGHT THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. OF THE I WILL JUST ASK YOU TO HOLD YOUR CLOTHES FOR ONE MOMENT BEFORE AS ANYBODY DASHES OUT SO WE CAN HAVE THIS ISLAND IS A ROLL CALL PLEASE IRWIN. HERE WHEN HERE GREAT. GRAYSON.

GOALS WHEN IT COMES TO ADD CONFRONTING THE CLIMATE CRISIS- AND THE DEVIL CAN REALLY BE IN THE DETAILS IN TERMS AS- EXECUTING AGAINST THOSE GOALS AND I WOULD SAY THAT. MY VIEW IS THAT WE THE ONLY WAY THAT WE ARE GOING TO ACHIEVE OUR CLIMATE GOALS IN THE STATE IS WITH A LARGE VARIETY OF POLICY INCENTIVES THAT WILL ENABLE THE MARKET TO TRANSITION. I TO OUR CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE SO UP WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ALL RIGHT- DO WE HAVE A MOTION. SECOND. ALL RIGHT.

AM TERRIBLY SORRY ABOUT THE LATE BY TIME I RAN TO THE ALL THE MY OFFICE TO BETTER MYSELF AND RAN BACK AS WE NOW KNOW THINKING ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR- BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LONG AS THE PRESENT LOOK AT. THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN THAT ELECT LIFTED- MILLIONS OF CHILDREN OUT OF POVERTY ACROSS UNITED STATES- ENDED- AT THE END OF LAS YEAR AND WHAT THAT RESULTED TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION. A CHILDREN NOW FALLING INTO POVERTY IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE THE INABILITY OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ACT. ON THE LARGEST ANTI POVERTY PROGRAM THAT WE'VE HAD WHICH IS- THE ABILITY TO INCREASE THE CHILD TAX CREDIT. HERE WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS THE ABILITY TO INCREASE THE CHILD TAX CREDIT TO TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. OPPORTUNITY BETWEEN THE AGES OF SUCH. AS ZERO AND SEVENTEEN. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA BE IN A POSITION TO BE ABLE TO AUGMENT WHAT WE NOW HAVE THE YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT ONE. THOUSAND DOLLARS BETWEEN ZERO. TO FIVE YEARS OLD- BUT THIS REALLY WOULD BE A GAME CHANGER BECAUSE WE'VE NOT HAD- ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION CHILDREN FALL BACK INTO POVERTY FOR THOSE FAMILIES WERE THIRTY THOUSAND- ENVELOPE. AND IDA IN IN THE INABILITY OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO STEP UP- HIS WE HAS HAD DEVASTATING IMPACTS ON THOSE FAMILIES. ARE EARNING THIRTY THOUSAND AND BELOW. I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS- AND HOW GRATEFUL I AM FOR THE COMMITTEE TO HEAR THIS- BECAUSE WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES KIDS WERE GOING TO SLEEP HUNGRY NIGHT. AT THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN BELOW AND THERE'S- A IN. IT DOES ALMOST. NOTHING ANYBODY CAN DO WE CAN DO TO HELP THEM EXCEPT FOR THE- DOLLARS THAT NOW ARE NOT COMING INTO FAMILIES AND TODAY ON TAX. ON THE DAY THAT WE'RE FILING TAXES I THINK IT'S- IT'S IMPORTANT WE STRESS. HOW FAMILIES COULD HAVE RECEIVED- THE ADDITIONAL DOLLARS THERE THAT ARE NOT. RECEIVING THIS BILL ALSO. INCREASES THE KELETI SEAT FOR THOSE WHO ARE OF FILING THIRTY THOUSAND AND BELOW FROM A TAX CREDIT THAT WOULD RANGE ANYWHERE FROM A DOLLAR TO ABOUT TWO FIFTY FIVE TWO. TO TWO FIFTY FIVE AUTOMATICALLY NOT AN ICMA NOT SEEM A LOT BUT WHEN YOU'RE MAKING THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A BELOW TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS- IT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EATING. AND NOT EATING. MAN AND MANY MEMBERS ON EXTREMELY GRAY FOR THE UP. TO PRESENT- AND WOULD NOT HAVE OVER TO TWO OF OUR- WITNESSES THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ANA HOW SUPPLIED WITH UNITED WAYS OF CALIFORNIA AND ON BEHALF OF THE KELLY ATC COALITION WE ARE PROUD CO SPONSORS OF AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY NINE. THE BILL DOES TWO THINGS IT MAKES PERMANENT A PERMANENT CHANGE TO THE KELLY ATC FOR THREE POINT FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS ENSURING THEY GET A MEANINGFUL CREDIT OF AT LEAST TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS. AND IT STEPS UP WITH THE TARGETED SOLUTION FOR PRESSING CRISIS IN OUR STATE CHILD POVERTY FIRST ON THE MINIMUM CAL THE ATC ABOUT HALF OF WORKERS WITHOUT CHILDREN IN THE HOME RECEIVE AND KELLY I TO SEE OF UNDER A HUNDRED DOLLARS. AND MOST OF THEM ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE FEDERAL EITC ON TOP OF THIS MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA WITH CHILDREN ALSO RECEIVE A KELLY ATC OF LESS THAN A HUNDRED DOLLARS. RESEARCH PROVE PROVE THAT TAX CREDITS ARE ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS OF DEFEATING POVERTY AND WE HAVE SEEN THIS RECENTLY. LAST YEAR THE EXPANDED FEDERAL CHILD TAX CREDIT CUT CHILD POVERTY BY 33% IN CALIFORNIA. DATA SHOWED THIS LEAD TO GREATER FOOD SECURITY% HOUSING STABILITY. BETTER JOBS AND LESS STRESS IN FAMILIES WITH KIDS. NOW THE EXPANDED CDC HAS EXPIRED ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION CHILDREN ARE FALLING BACK INTO POVERTY RIGHT NOW ON OUR WATCH. IN JANUARY THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN IN POVERTY SPIKE DRAMATICALLY WITH BLACK AND LATINO CHILDREN SEEING THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE INCREASE. AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY NINE PER CHILD TAX CREDIT PAYMENT. IS THE MOST TARGETED AND EFFECTIVE WAY TO MEET SEVERAL GOALS. REDUCE POVERTY HOPE FAMILIES DEALING-WITH INFLATION. BOOSTS LOCAL ECONOMIES AND IMPROVE LIFELONG RESULTS FOR CHILDREN. TAKEN TOGETHER WITH THE KELLY ATC MINIMUM. THIS IS A RARE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A BIG DOWN PAYMENT ON THE FUTURE PROSPERITY WILL MEET IN THE PRESSING NEEDS OF CHILDREN RIGHT NOW. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO TAKE WHAT CODY SHARES NEXT AND APPLY THAT TO WELL OVER TWO MILLION CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT SO MANY CHILDREN IN OUR STATE ARE EXPERIENCING SUCH HARDSHIP. BUT WE CAN ACT TO CHANGE THIS. SO WE ENCOURAGE YOU WHEN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACT TO VOTE BY ON A B. TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY NINE THANK YOU. HELLO TEARING MEMBERS MY NAME IS CODY EVAN FELLED AND I'M TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD AND LIVING IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY. I'M ALSO REPRESENTING JOHN BURTON ADVOCATES FOR YOUTH AS A FORMER FOSTER YOUTH. IT IS MY HONOR TO SPEAK IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY ON WHY SUPPORT AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY NINE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER SANTIAGO. I HAD MY DAUGHTER IN MAY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE IT WAS A VERY HIGH RISK PREGNANCY WHICH CREATED A LOT OF ANXIETY. BECAUSE I WAS VISITING THE DOCTOR SEVERAL TIMES A WEEK INCREASING MY CHANCES OF CONTRACTING COVERT NINETEEN. I LOST HOURS AT WORK BECAUSE THE PANDEMIC PUT THE WORLD ON HOLD. I LEARNED VERY QUICKLY HOW EXPENSIVE HAVING A CHILD COULD BE. I QUALIFIED FOR THE FEDRAL ADVANCE CHILD TAX CREDITS BUT I HAD ALREADY FILED MY TAXES BEFORE MY CHILD WAS BORN. I CHECKED WEEKLY FOR THE UPDATED PORTAL TO BE AVAILABLE BUT IT NEVER WAS. IN FACT I ONLY JUST RECEIVED MY CHILD TAX CREDIT REFUND A WEEK AGO ON APRIL TWELFTH. I WENT THROUGH ALL OF MY SCHOOL SAVINGS TO JUST TO CARE FOR MY CHILD BECAUSE I NEVER RECEIVED THE ADVANCE PAYMENTS. KEEP IN MIND ON AVERAGE FOR SIX MONTHS FOR FORMULA DIAPERS AND WIPES I COULD SPEND ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS. THIS COST DOES NOT INCLUDE. INCLUDE ITEMS NEEDED FOR OTHER HEALTH AND HYGIENE ESSENTIALS SAFETY EQUIPMENT REQUIRED FROM MY HOME. SENSORY STIMULATION SOCIALIZATION IN PLAY AND RIGHT NOW DAY CARES TOO EXPENSIVE. RECEIVING A CHURCH CALIFORNIA CHILD TAX CREDIT PAYMENT AS OUTLINED IN AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY NINE WOULD ALLOW MY DAUGHTER THE OPPORTUNITY TO SOCIALIZE WITH CHILDREN HER OWN AGE. I WOULD ALSO HAVE THE CHANCE TO PURCHASE TOYS TO HELP MY DAUGHTER THRIVE WITH STIMULATION TO REACH ALL OF HER DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES. THIS MONEY WOULD GIVE THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES AND ME THE SUPPORT. THEY NEED TO TRANSITION FROM THE EXPERIENCES FACED BY THE PANDEMIC SOCIETY'S EXPECTATION OF CHILD DEVELOPMENT IS A STRONG INFLUENCER. AS A MOTHER IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE ALL NECESSARY ELEMENTS TO ENSURE SHE THRIVES. AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY NINE WOULD HELP ME FULFILL MY RESPONSIBILITY AS I PURSUE MY EDUCATION AND BUILD A BETTER FUTURE FOR US.

WE IT'S ESTIMATED THAT WE- ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT THREE POINT ONE MILLION JOBS- THAT ARE SUPPORTED BY TRADE MOVING THROUGH OUR PORTS. AT AND SO IT'S HUGELY IMPERATIVE THAT WE TRY TO TACKLE THESE ISSUES AND WE DO HAVE. A PACKAGE OF BILLS ARE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW BUT WE UNDERSTAND CAME OVER THE LAST DECADE EXACERBATED BY. THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC CHANGES IN CONSUMER SPENDING HABITS- THIS IS BANNED REALLY I'M ACUTELY FELT BUYER CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURAL EXPORTERS- AND SO FOR US. THAT'S A HUGE IMPORTANT- PIECE THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO INCENTIVES AND GETTING INTERMODAL EQUIPMENT WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE CONGESTION THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. IS NOT ALLOWING FOR THE EXPERT COMMUNITY TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE CHAIN MANY CONTAINERS- AND DIFFERENT EQUIPMENT ARE. BEING SHIPPED RIGHT BACK TO ASIA AND OTHER PLACES BECAUSE IT'S JUST CHEAPER AND MORE EFFICIENT TO DO THAT. SO THIS BILL CREATES TO TAX CREDITS TO INCENTIVIZE I GOT EXPORTERS IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING AT THE CARGO CREDIT FOR ADDITIONAL TONNAGE BEING EXPORTED AND A TAX CREDIT FOR THE MOVE OF INTERMODAL EQUIPMENT FROM STORAGE TO AN EXPORTER. SO WE THINK THAT'S REALLY GONNA HELP THE EXPORTERS ARE KIND OF DIFFERENT THE COSTS AND INCREASE THEIR CAPACITY. SO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PORT COMMUNITY YOU KNOW OUR EXPERT COMMUNITY IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO US AND IT'S A PRIORITY AND WE THINK THIS BILL WOULD REALLY HELP WITH THE CONGESTION CURRENTLY. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU PRESTON YOUNG FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HERE IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT MR- QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SO WHAT SORT OF CHANGES HERE ARE YOU AND THE COMMITTEE CONSIDERING. RATHER THAN THE DOLLAR FIFTY PER YEAH THANK YOU MR QUIRK- SO IT IN THE ANALYSIS YOU'LL NOTE THAT THERE IS A REFERENCE WITH RESPECT TO THE RETROACTIVITY OF THE CREDIT SERVICES PROPOSED THAT'S BEING REMOVED- THERE'S ALSO REFERENCE TO- THE- I'M SORRY I HAVE THE ADMINISTRATOR IT'S A- BIT CARRYOVERS AND THE- DOLLARS ACTS BENEFIT THAT'S RIGHT THERE'S A THERE'S A CARRYOVER PROVISION WHICH WAS. UNLIMITED AND NOW IT'S GOING TO BE LIMITED TO TWO EIGHT YEARS AS PROPOSED BY F. TV- AND THEN ON THE- CHANGE WITH RESPECT TO DEDUCTIBILITY VERSES THE CREDIT. THAT'S GOING TO BE LIMITED AS WELL SO NO DEDUCTION WILL BE ALLOWED FOR EXPENSES WHEN THE VALUE EXPENSES WAS INCLUDED IN THE CREDIT VALUE OKAY BUT HOW IS THIS GOING TO HELP. EVERYBODY GETS A DOLLAR FIFTY PER DELIVERY AND YOU KNOW. YOU'VE YOU'VE TRIED THE REQUIREMENTS ON IT THAT'S FINE BUT HOW DOES THIS REALLY HELP US BUILD UP OUR INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH I BE BETTER OFF SPENDING THAT MONEY JUST BUYING MORE CONTAINERS. FOR USE IN THE PORTS- SUBSIDIZING THAT WAY RATHER THAN. I MEAN THERE'S NO GUARANTEE. WHAT HAPPENS THAT DOLLAR FIFTY. RIGHT AND THERE'S TWO COMPONENTS THAT I'M I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT UP THE EQUIPMENT SIDE THAT WE WERE TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT THROUGH A SEPARATE TAX CREDIT THAT'S MISTRUST ALMOST TAX CREDIT PROPOSAL- ON THIS ONE VERY SPECIFIC WHEN THE DOLLAR FIFTY THAT'S NOT CONTAINER SPECIFIC THAT'S ON TONNAGE- AND SO THAT'S INTENDED TO HELP. DEFRAY THE FOCUS OF ALL OF THIS TONNAGE IN OUR CONTAINER COMMUNITY. MAKE IT MORE ACCESSIBLE FOR PORTS LIKE. THE PORT OF STOCKTON- PORT HUENEME ME PORTS INDIGO THAT AREN'T CONTAINERIZED FOCUS BUT PROVIDE MORE ACCESS AND AN INTERMODAL OPPORTUNITY THOUGH I SEE YOU'RE NOT CONTAINER. THERE'S A SECOND COMPONENT OF THIS WHICH IS THE SECOND ONE IS SPECIFIC TO CONTAINER ACCESS LAWS- AND- BUT THAT DOLLAR FIFTY PER TONNAGE IS ONLY BASED ON YOUR ADDITIONAL TIME SO YOU DON'T GET PAID FOR YOUR BASELINE TONNAGE. YOU ONLY GET PAID FOR THE ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OVER THE PRIOR YEAR- AND SO IS INTENDED TO ONLY OFFSET- SO IT'S REDUCING THE COSTS FOR WHO THE PORT FOR THE ACTUAL EXPORTER THE ACTUAL EXPORTER THE CARGO HONOR SO. WHAT HAPPENS SO BASICALLY STOCKTON ISN'T COMPETITIVE. IS THAT THE PROBLEM. STOCKTON IS VERY COMPETITIVE- FOR THE CARGOES THAT STOCKTON HAS ALWAYS BEEN COMPETITIVE FOR. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY COST COMPETITIVE COMPARED TO THE CONTAINERIZED EXPORT TRADE RIGHT- AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS BROUGHT IN THE- THE ACTUAL BASE. SO YOU'RE OUT OF THE VERYPLACE WHERE A LOT OF EXPORTERS FIND THEMSELVES. NOW WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE OPTIONS- AND- THIS THAT'S ONE COMPONENT OF IT. THE OTHER COMPONENT OF IT OF ACCESS IS THE SECOND ONE WHICH IS WE HAVE A GLUT OF EMPTY CONTAINERS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RIGHT. AND WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH INTO CONTAINERS IN PLACES WHERE PEOPLE WANT TO EXPORT WITH THEM PRIMARILY IN CENTRAL AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE ACTUAL REPOSITIONING COSTS TO GET A QUICK MEN OUT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA INTO CENTRAL VALLEY IS A NEW COSTS THAT WAS NOT ACCOUNTED FOR BY PEOPLE PREPEND EMIC I'D ALWAYS HAD A- A LOT OF ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT AND CONTAINERS AVAILABLE. YOU COULD PICK ONE UP ANYONE TIME YOU WANTED- IT WAS NOT VERY COSTLY. NOW THEY'RE VERY COSTL THEY'RE OUT OF POSITION AND EVEN THE COST OF THE ACTUAL TRANSPORTATION HIGHER SO THERE'S- MORE DEMAND FOR TRUCKING ALL OF THAT- ASSOCIATED WITH IT SO THE SO THIS WOULD BE BASICALLY SUBSIDIZE SUBSIDY FOR BRINGING CONTAINERS FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. IN YEAH ANY OF THOSE REPOSITIONING IS BUT THAT'S THE PRIMARY ONE. OKAY AND THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE THE DOLLAR FIFTY. WE LOVE THAT BACK CREDIT IS KEEN ON A THIRTY DOLLAR MOVE WE ACTUALLY DO BELIEVE THAT THAT WILL HELP- OFFSET SOME OF THOSE COSTS- THAT THE TRUCKING MARKET IS YOU KNOW IS VERY VOLATILE SPOT PRICES ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE- BUT- WHEN WE LOOK AT THE MARKETPLACE ITSELF WHAT WE DID WAS WE- CAME TO THAT. DOLLAR FIGURE- BY ESTIMATING HOW MANY ADDITIONAL PIECES OF EQUIPMENT MIGHT POTENTIALLY HAVE AVAILABLE WITHIN THE THRESHOLD- WE SET A THRESHOLD IN THIS BILL SO THE LEGISLATURE CAN CHANGE THAT- DURING THE BUDGET PROCESS BUT THAT'S ONE OF THE CONTROLS IN HERE TOO THAT IT'S LIMITED BY THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S APPROPRIATED IN THE BILL OR NOW I UNDERSTAND A LOT BETTER. ARM SO THE CONTAINERS ARE BEING MOVED UP HOW WOULD THIS AFFECT US SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN OAKLAND. WHAT PRIMARILY ON THE EXPORT SIDE- WE BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD IT WOULD BENEFIT OAKLAND- STOCKTON AND- WHERE SACRAMENTO- WITH RESPECT TO AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS ON WITH RESPECT TO MANUFACTURING EXPORTS WE THINK THAT IT WOULDN'T WOULD AFFECT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PORTS PRIMARILY- BUT- YOU KNOW IF YOU WANNA SPEAK A LITTLE BIT SIR TO. I THINK UNDER. THE IN THE DAY WHEN I CAN BE SUPPORT OR NOT WE'RE NOT COMPETING AGAINST EACH OTHER OKAY I JUST WANTED TO KNOW THAT TO OCCUR. I AM I CAN BE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVINE YEAH I THINK YOU IT'S GOOD TO SEE ALL OF THE U. S. SEVENTY. IN YEARS SO IT'S NICE TO HAVE YOU GUYS UP HERE- AND DESCRIBING SOME OF THAT I'M I'M HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU KNOW MY MIDDLE SCHOOL YOU KNOW DAUGHTER AOUT SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES- EVERYONE IS HYPER AWARE OF THIS. AND I THINK WHAT WE STRUGGLE WITH IS LIKE THE SCALE OF THIS AND I THINK DOCTOR COURT GRAYSON INTERESTING ISSUE ABOUT OKAY IT'S A DOLLAR FIFTY PER MOVE. HOW MANY OF THESE MOVES ARE WE TALKING ABOUT AND- YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THIS CHALLENGE WHAT WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE WHAT WHAT ARE WE KIND OF PROJECTING OUT- THE CHALLENGE OF MOVING THESE GOODS WILL BE ART pTHAT THIS ACTUALLY DOES MAKE AN IMPACT WE DON'T DO IT JUST TO DO IT WE WANTED RIGHT. UNDERSTAND THAT RIGHT NOW YEAH IF WE'RE TRYING TO REALLY VISUALIZE THE SCALE- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MILLIONS OF TRANSACTIONS- BUT TO MAKE THAT. TANGIBLE FOR YOU KNOW TO ACTUALLY BREAK I DOWN TO WHAT WHAT WHAT YOU ACTUALLY PROVIDING THE CREDIT FOR AN BE PROVIDED ON VALUE. OR ON THE ACTUAL WEIGHT OF THE GOODS BECAUSE OF THE TWO THINGS THAT YOU POTENTIALLY. ARE ALWAYS KEEPING TRACK OF- OUTSIDE WITH THE TRANSACTION ITSELF- AND SO ON THE TONNAGE SCALE YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE TRYING TO ENVISION WHAT WE WANT WITH THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF. OF WAIT THE YOU COULD FIT IN ONE CONTAINER- YOU KNOW THE WEIGHT SCALE IS UP TO EIGHTY THOUSAND. POUNDS- BUT NOT ALL THAT IS A NEW- AND SO WHAT WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING HERE IS THAT YOU'RE ONLY GETTING CREDIT FOR THE ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OVER YOUR BASE LINE CREDIT- THE CHALLENGE OBVIOUSLY IS YOU DON'T WANT TO PAY SOMEONE TO DO SOMETHING THROUGH A CREDIT FOR SOMETHING THEY WERE GOING TO DO ANYWAYS- BUT YOU DO WANT TO PROVIDE AN INCENTIVE FOR YOU TO INCREASE THAT- SO IF YOU'RE TALKING. ABOUT A FAMILY FARM. THAT'S USUALLY DOING TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED CONTAINERS- YOU KNOW THAT'S A LOT THAT'S A LOT OF CONTAINERS- AND- SO IF YOU'RE ABLE TO DO. 5% 10% MORE OF THIS YOU'RE TALKING. ANALYSIS OF VALUE TO ACTUALLY OFFSET THE COST OF THE ADDITIONAL LOGISTICS- AND HIRING ADDITIONAL TRUCKERS. ADDITIONAL CONTAINERS MOVING THOSE THINGS IN THE PLAN SO WOULD YOU. YOU KNOW TO BE ABLE TO GIVE A SENSE OF HOW MANY CONTAINERS ARE WE RE POSITIONING THAT WE WERE IN OTHERWISE REPOSITIONING GIVEN. THE CONSTRAINTS THAT WE HAVE ON THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND- JUST THE DEMAND ON ON GOOD SIDE. THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT NATURALLY JUST AVAILABLE FOR US YEAH- SO OVERALL WE'RE WE- THROUGH THE PANDEMIC WE WERE JUST SHY OF 20% MORE CONTAINERS MOVING THROUGH OUR OUR MAIN TRADE GATEWAYS IN LA LONG BEACH. WHICH MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO ACCOMMODATE 20% MORE CONTAINERS GOING BACK TO ASIA. AND THAT'S WHAT'S CREATING A LOT OF OUR CONGESTION- AND ON THE IMPORT SIDE THAT CROWDS OUT IMPORTS- AND SO OUR TOTAL INPUT IMPORT VALUES HAVE BEEN DECREASING AS ARE EXPLORED. EMPTY LOADS HAVE BEEN GOING UP- BUT THAT'S ABOUT 20% HIGHER. HOW MANY CONTAINERS IS 20% HIGHER. IT'S ABOUT TWO MILLION AND LA IT'S ABOUT TWO MILLION IN LONG BEACH- SO WE WE'VE NEVER BEEN BUSIER WHERE WE'RE MOVING ABOUT FOUR MILLION MORE TO USE THAN WE TYPICALLY WOULD- AND- SO IT'S SUBSTANTIAL YEAH ALL RIGHT THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT. RIGHT A MISTER VEHICLE WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. SPECT GAS FOR NAY VOTE ALL RIGHT AND- THIS IS OF COURSE- FOR A HEARING ONLY AND SO- I'M SURE EVERYBODY WILL REMEMBER WHEN IT'S TIME TO VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND THEN- I HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS. UP AGAIN FOR AYE- FILE ITEM. SEVEN TWENTY SIX FIFTY ONE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THAT GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN MEMBERS HAPPY TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWO SIX FIVE ONE THIS BILL SUPPORTS OUR STATE'S EFFORTS TO INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN TWENTY NINETEEN SENATOR BELL PASSED A BILL TO EXEMPT COMMUNITY LAND TRUSTS FROM PROPERTY TAXES. IF THE DEVELOPMENT WILL SUPPLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING THIS WAS A REALLY INNOVATIVE IDEA AT THE TIME AND WAS PASSED INTO LAW WITH A SUNSET IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE INITIAL RESULTS HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGING AND THIS BILL PROPOSES TO EXTEND THE SUNSET AN ADDITIONAL FIVE YEARS TO TWENTY THIRTY SO THAT COMMUNITY LAND TRUSTS CAN. CONTINUE TO UTILIZE THIS EXEMPTION AND CONTINUE TO ACCUMULATE MORE DATA DEMONSTRATING THE EFFICACY OF THIS LAW AS CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE WITH THE ISSUE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING I BELIEVE WE NEED TO PURSUE ANY AVENUE WE CAN TO MEET THIS NEED. AB TWENTY SIX FIFTY ONE SUPPORTS THIS EFFORT OP PLEASE BE JOINED TODAY BY PAUL CAN SOLVE THIS WHO IS REPRESENTING THE IRVINE COMMUNITY LAND TRUST. THANK YOU VERY MUCH BARGAINS ALL THIS ON THE HAVE THE RIGHT COMMUNITY LAND TRUST AND THANK YOU A SMOOTHER PETRIE-NORRIS FOR LEADING US ON THIS ISSUE- MY CLIENT THE KERR THE- THE COMMUNITY LAND TRUST OF IRVINE THEY- THEY WERE ABLE TO UTILIZE THIS FURTHER. CURRENT PROJECTS SAGE PARK WHICH IS A SIXTY EIGHT UNIT- AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT FOR SALE PROJECT THERE ARE SIX THOUSAND APPLICANTS FOR THE FOR THIS ONE HOUSING PROJECT SO THE DEMAND IS THERE THE DEMAND WAS SO HIGH THEY HAD TO DO A LOTTERY. IN ORDER FOR PEOPLE TO FIGURE OUT THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO. HAVE THE LUCK TO GET INTO ONE OF THESE HOMES SO THE DEMAND IS REALLY HIGH UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL TOOK EFFECT JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY. AND THREE MONTHS LATER COVETED. AND NASH TOOK THAT STOPPED EVERYBODY IN THEIR TRACKS AND BECAUSE EVERYBODY TO PUT EVERYTHING ON HOLD- THE SUPPLY J. ISSUES THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVINE WAS MENTIONING PRIOR IN THE PRIOR BILL. WAS VERY MUCH A AFFECT FOR US THAT CAUSES TO HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE TABLE AND RE EVALUATE WHETHER OR NOT THESE. PROJECTS WERE GONNA PENCIL OUT REMAIN AFFORDABLE- WHAT WE WERE WE STILL HAVE A FEW YEARS LEFT ON THE BOOKS BUT OUR FINANCERS ARE LENDERS WANT TO SEE MORE LONGEVITY THEY WANT TO KNOW THAT. WHEN THEY'RE INVESTING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO THESE PROJECTS. THAT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE SOME STABILITY THERE. AND THEY WANT TO KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THIS PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTIONS GOING GOING TO REMAIN. AND SO WE HAVE A ANOTHER SEVEN ACRE PARCEL THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO GET STARTED ON AND- JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY THREE. IT'S GOING TO TAKE TWO YEARS TO ADJUST THE PLANNING PORTION BEFORE WE CAN EVEN GET TO THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE AND THEN ANOTHER TWO YEARS ON TOP OF THAT. IF WE'RE LUCKY TO CONSTRUCT ALL THESE PROJECTS- THE WINTERS DON'T WANT TO END ON IT BECAUSE OF THE WELFARE EXEMPTION AND WHETHER I WAS GOING TO BE IN QUESTION RIGHT SO. FOR THOSE REASONS WERE ASKING FOR A FIVE YEAR SUNSET EXIT EXTENSION- NOT ONLY TO PROVE THAT WE BELONG TO BE IN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TOOLBOX BUT WE SHOULD BE IN THE TOP DRAWER OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TOOLBOX. SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE GOT RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE- HELLO HONORABLE CHEERING MEMBERS. MY NAME IS AMY HINES SHAIKH WITH WILDCAT CONSULTING REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY LAND TRUST NETWORK. THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY LAND TRUST NETWORK IS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION OF TWENTY SIX COMMUNITY LAND TRUSTS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. COLLECTIVELY REPRESENTING WELL OVER TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF COMMUNITY ASSETS FOR PERMANENTLY AFFORDABLE HOMES AND COMMUNITY FACILITIES. HOUSING THOUSANDS OF LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. WHILE OTHER FORMS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING PLACE INCOME RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR PROPERTIES THAT EXPIRE AFTER SOME PERIOD OF TIME OFTEN. APPROXIMATELY THIRTY YEARS OR SO. CLT IS KEEP PROPERTIES PERMANENTLY AFFORDABLE THROUGH OUR NINETY NINE YEAR GROUND LEASES WHILE PROVIDING STABILITY TO RESIDENTS. ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY SIX FIFTY ONE WILL EXTEND THE SUNSET OF A BILL THAT'S BEEN A MENTAL USEFUL TO US. SB ONE NINETY SIX SPELL FROM TWENTY NINETEEN AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER NOTED- SB ONE NINETY SIX HAS ALLOWED COMMUNITY LAND TRUST TO BE EXEMPT FROM PROPERTY TAXES WHILE OUR PROPERTIES ARE UNDER CONSTRUCTION BEFORE. THEY BECOME HABITABLE. WELL PROFIT DRIVEN HOUSING DEVELOPERS CAN PAY PROPERTY TAXES WHILE THEIR PROPERTIES ARE UNDER CONSTRUCTION BECAUSE THEY MAKE UP THE LOSSES WHEN SELLING OR LEASING THE RESIDENTS AT A MARKET RATE. CLT IS ARE NOT ABLE TO MAKE UP THE LOSSES BECAUSE OUR RESIDENTS ARE LOW INCOME AND- ALL UNITS. ARE TO ASSIST LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES IN RECEIVING STABLE HOMES WITH DIGNITY. OF OUR TWENTY SIX AFFILIATES MANY ARE CURRENTLY USING SB ONE NINETY SIX TO MAKE MUCH NEEDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS PENCIL OUT. INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO BOLINAS CLT. OAKLAND CLT. IRVINE CLT THAT MISTER GRAHAM. REPRESENTS AND PLANNED FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDE WEST MARIN CLT AND INLAND EQUITY C. L. TEAM.
