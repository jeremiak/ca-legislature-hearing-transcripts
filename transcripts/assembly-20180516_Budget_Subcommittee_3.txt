WEDNESDAY. MAY SIXTEENTH. SEEMS LIKE ONLY YESTERDAY WE WERE MEETING. IT WAS YESTERDAY THAT WE WERE MAILING. A WELCOME TO THE WHERE ARE WEDNESDAY MAY SIXTEENTH MEETING OF BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER THREE. WE ARE. KNOCKING A VOTE ON THE VOTE ONLY CALENDAR YET. WILL WAIT UNTIL WE HAVE ENOUGH MEMBERS HERE TO FORM A QUORUM AS WILL SKIP OVER VOTE ONLY. AND TO BEGIN AS A SUBCOMMITTEE OF ONE. WITH OUR PRESENTATIONS ON. THE AIRFORCE CARBON PLAN. LIMITATION I KNOW WE HAVE A NUMBER OF DEPARTMENTS OF THE PRESENTING ON THAT. ON THAT ITEM. EVERYTHING ON OUR ITEMS TO BE HURT. AGENDA THIS MORNING. OF WILL BE HOLD OPEN. SOME WON'T ANTICIPATE TAKING ANY ACTION TODAY. AND. WELCOME EVERYONE. THANK YOU THAT WAS LIKE IF YOU KNOW ABOUT. FORCE CARGO PLANE MY NAME'S QUE LEAVE RIGHT IN WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCE AGENCY AND. I WAS GONNA SUMMARIZE A PROPOSALS TODAY THEIR SET UP TO IMPLEMENT FORCE CARBON PLAN BUT WE HAVE. REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES IN THE BCP IN THE CROWD THAT WE CAN. BRING UP FOR QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. ALRIGHT DEPEND WHAT IS TO THE LEFT ME WE CAN. DO OUR BEST TO COVER A LOT OF CONTENT IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME GIVEN YOUR. YOUR HEAVY AGENDA TODAY SO THAT THOSE DUAL GOALS. LITTLE TOWN TO A RIGHT ON TARGET THE. SO LAST WEEK THE GOVERNOR. ANNOUNCED A PACKAGE OF ACTIONS STARTING WITH THE EXECUTIVE ORDER AND. THAT WAS REALLY SET UP TO IMPLEMENT THE FORCE CARBON PLAN IN THE GOALS WITHIN THE FORCE CARBON PLAN. HEADLINE GOAL OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDER WAS TO DOUBLE THE STATE'S INTERVENTIONS INTO THE IN THE DOUBLE THE DOUBLE THE STATE'S TREATMENT OF FORESTS. SO THAT WE CAN BUILD A RESILIENT. STATEWIDE FOREST ECOSYSTEM THAT CONVEYS ALL OF THE. BENEFITS THAT WE DEPEND ON FROM THE FOREST INCLUDING CARBON SEQUESTRATION WATER SUPPLY. ECOSYSTEM. BENEFITS ETCETERA. THE THE PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE. BEFORE YOU TODAY NEAR STAFF DID A GREAT JOB SUMMARIZING I'M REALLY CAPTURES. RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CAME BEFORE THE FORCE CARBON PLAN BUT WE'RE ALSO EMBODIED IN THE PLAN. THERE WERE. CAPTURED IN REPORTS FROM THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE. THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND THERE WERE MANY MANY OTHERS UP UNTIL THE DAY WE RELEASED IT WHERE PEOPLE ARE COMING OUT WITH WITH SEEMINGLY A CONSENSUS AROUND THE TYPES OF ACTIONS WE NEED TO TAKE. ACROSS BOTH TREATMENT AND AND AND USE OF THE WORD TO TO REALLY RAMP UP OUR EFFORTS AND OUR STATE FORESTS. WE ORGANIZE THIS PROPOSAL. IN IN FOR THEM THREE GENERAL CATEGORIES AND THE FIRST CATEGORY WAS TO INCREASE THE PACE AND SCALE OF FORCE MANAGEMENT IN RESTORATION EFFORTS. THAT'S ALL GO THROUGH THESE PROPOSALS BUT BUT. AT THE TOP OF IT IS CAL FIRES PROPOSAL TO DRAMATICALLY RAMPED UP ITS. ON GOING STAFFING TO CONDUCT PRESCRIBED BURN OPERATIONS AND FEEL REDUCTION OPERATIONS AND. WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL IS THESE WOULD BE NEW STAFF THAT WOULD NOT BE. FIREFIGHTER CLASSIFICATIONS ID BE DEDICATED TO FORCED YOU WORK AND THEY WOULD. REALLY BE THERE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR TO SET UP THAT PIPELINE OF PROJECTS THAT YOU NEED SET UP. TO TO TO ACTUALLY MAKE ALL OF THIS WORK THESE ARE REALLY GREAT OPPORTUNITIES FOR PROMOTION OF THAT INTO THE DEPARTMENT AND COULD SERVE AS. YOU KNOW THE DOORWAYS FOR FOR. CONSERVATION CORPS MEMBERS ARE OTHER OTHER OTHER FOLKS WITH WITH WITH WITH FORESTRY EXPERIENCE BUT NOT FIRELIGHT CERTIFICATIONS SO. WE SEE THIS IS A GREAT JOBS TRAINING KIND OF OPPORTUNITY BUT ALSO ONE WAY TO STABILIZE OUR OUR PIPELINE OF PROJECTS THAT WE NEED TO. CONDUCT OVER TIME THE. THE CINEMATIC CONSERVANCY THAT'S THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE M. FOR PROP SIXTY EIGHT. IS DIRECTED THAT. IMPLEMENTING THEIR WATERSHED IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM WHICH IS REALLY THE MODEL FOR HOW WE WANT TO ADDRESS FORESTRY ISSUE STATEWIDE IT IS A. IT IS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT ACROSS THE JURISDICTION OF THE CONSERVANCY THAT'S FOCUSED AT MAXIMIZING STAKEHOLDERS WHO ARE PARTICIPATING THESE PROJECTS BUT ALSO FORGING. KIND OF. BINDING COMMITMENTS WITH WITH OUR WITH OUR LEATHERLANDOWNING PARTNERS IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR PRIVATE LAND OWNERS IN THEN. MAXIMIZING THOSE COMMITMENTS FOR. LANDSCAPE WIDE PROJECTS. THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY WE HAVE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS AND YOU TARA FUNDS PROPOSED HERE. THAT FUNDING IS REALLY INTENDED TO BE. CATALYST FUNDING TO TO REPLICATE THE WATERSHED IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM OVER DIFFERENT REGIONS OF STATE SO IN IN IN THE SIERRA REGION WE HAVE THIS YEAR NEVADA CONSERVANCY. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE MANY WE HAVE MULTIPLE STAY CONSERVANCY IS IN THE NORTHERN PARTS OF OUR STATE WE DON'T HAVE THE CONSERVANCY'S TO SUPPORT THIS TYPE OF. REGIONAL LANDSCAPE ECOSYSTEM Y. TYPE OF RESPONSE. NOW TO RESOURCE AGENCY WE HAVE A LOT OF WE WE HAVE. GREAT PARTNERSHIPS WITH ORGANIZATIONS STATEWIDE AND WE WANT TO USE THIS FUNDING TO PLAY A ROLE AND. IN A BRING TOGETHER THESE COLLABORATIONS AND. YOU KNOW FORCING A A A LARGER COORDINATED EFFORT. THEM WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE THE GUIDANCE ALREADY. PARKS AND RECREATION LEGACY FORESTED STATE PARK THAT'S FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN PROP SIXTY EIGHT FROM THE FUNDING THE WRIST THEY HAVE ALLOCATED IN THE BOND. THIS IS. OUR CHANCE TO SHOWCASE TO THE PUBLIC WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE FROM OUR FORCE RESTORATION WORK. THE STATE HAS MADE. MANY MANY MANY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IN ITS NATURAL ECOSYSTEM THE STATE PARK WE CARE ABOUT. DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IN TERMS OF INFRASTRUCTURE STATE PARK BUT THIS IS ALSO ONE OF THOSE AREAS WHERE THERE HAS NOT BEEN. BUT ENOUGH INVESTMENT TO KEEP UP WITH THE NEED IN OUR IN OUR NATURAL LANDS. AND THE PARKS WILL. LOOK AT THEIR LEGACY FOREST DO THIS WORK BUT THEN THIS IS OUR CHANCE TO SHOW SHOWCASE PUBLICLY AND PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. THE NEXT CATEGORY IS BUILDING LOCAL CAPACITY AND STRENGTHENING REGIONAL COLLABORATIONS THIS REALLY THEN OVERLAY OF. HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU GET THIS WORK DONE IF IF THE IF THE SCALE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO? AND ALSO ACHIEVE THE BENEFITS THAT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE. MOVING AWAY FROM FROM FROM. FROM SMALLER COLLECTED. PROJECTS ACROSS THE STATE AND TRYING TO TO LOOK AT PROJECTS IN A MORE HOLISTIC FASHION ACROSS LARGER LANDSCAPES. THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION HERE HAS A PROPOSAL FOR ONE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL LICENSE PLATE FUND. THAT WOULD FUND THE THAT THE ACTORS ON THE GROUND THE WATERSHED COORDINATORS WHO ARE THERE TO REALLY BRING TOGETHER THE LOCAL. THE LOCAL AND REGIONAL. GRASSROOTS. NONPROFITS BUT ALSO INDIVIDUAL AND PRIVATE LANDOWNERS WHO ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING AND LARGE COLLABORATIVE FORESTRY EFFORTS BUT DON'T HAVE THAT. KIND OF ORGANIZATION AND THEY ARE ALSO THEY ARE ALSO THE ONES THAT DRIVE. THE. YOU KNOW GRANT GRANT WRITING ACTIVITIES PROJECT READY NESS RELIEF TRYING TO SERVICE THE GLUE BETWEEN ALL THESE DIFFERENT. GOODWILL BUT SOMETIMES DESPAIR PARTIES AND BRING THEM TOGETHER. THE THIRD IS. INNOVATION AND AND AND INCREASING ECONOMIES AROUND THE USE OF MATERIALS FROM POOR SELF PROJECTS. THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT IF YOU. HERE RIGHT NOW IF THE SCALE OF OF RESTORATION THAT WERE OPERATING THAT WE HAVE A HARD TIME MANAGING. THE. THE PRODUCTS FROM FORCE RESTORATION ACTIVITIES. MOST OF THOSE THOSE PRODUCTS GO. I'M USED ESSENTIALLY AND AND AND BURNT IN PILES ON THE FLOOR ONCE FOREST. THINNING ACTIVITIES COMPLETED SO THERE'S A REAL. REAL OPPORTUNITY TO FIND NEW WAYS TO USE THOSE MATERIALS THAT CAN ALSO THEY CAN THEY CAN REDUCE OUR JUST BURNING OF THESE MATERIALS ON THE GROUND IN CREATING THAT. THEY ARE QUALITY IN CARBON EMISSIONS AT THAT HAS BUT ALSO CREATE ECONOMIES AROUND THE USE OF THESE MATERIALS IN A WAY THAT. WILL HOPEFULLY INCENTIVIZE IN A WHIRL. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND SO WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING HERE IS THEM BY THREE PROPOSALS THE. BOARD OF THE FIRST ONE WOULD BE THE BOARD OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION. SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THIS BUDGET YEAR. AND THEN SOME FUNDING ON GOING TO ESTABLISH A. JOINT INSTITUTE FOR WOOD PRODUCTS INNOVATION WE HAVE INCREDIBLE CAPACITY IN OUR UC AND CSU AND. OTHER ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS TO. TO REALLY PUSH THE NEEDLE NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY ON AND WOOD PRODUCTS. ENGINEERING AND DESIGN AND. THOSE EFFORTS ARE ARE SOMEONE ONGOING RIGHT NOW ON THE IN THE IN THE INDIVIDUAL DEPARTMENTS AND DIVISIONS OF OUR UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BRING THOSE TOGETHER AND TRY TO CREATE AN INSTITUTE THAT COULD LEVERAGE BOTH THE. KIND OF TECHNICAL EXPERTISE AROUND DESIGNING THESE PRODUCTS BUT ALSO THE. THE KIND OF TESTING EXPERTISE AROUND ENGINEERING ARCHITECTURAL EARTHQUAKE. RESILIENCY AT CETERA. WE ARE LOOKING AT A IT'S AN ADOPTION OF A OF A NEW BUILDING CODE IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO I BELIEVE. THAT COULD EXPAND THE USE OF THESE ENGINEERED WOOD PRODUCTS TOO MUCH TALLER BUILDINGS AND ARE CURRENTLY ALLOWED SO THIS WOULD PUT US IN THE POSITION TO. LEVERAGE AND EXPERTISE TO. GET THOSE PRODUCTS RATING ALSO GET THAT INDUSTRY REDDING CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE IT IS IT IS. BEING DEVELOPED ALONG THE WEST COAST IN OREGON AND WASHINGTON AS WELL. CAN AND YOU SAID THE. BUILDING CODE IS INTENDED TO GO INTO EFFECT. OF THE REVISIONS IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO THINGS TWENTY TWENTY IF I'M REMEMBERING WAS TWENTY TWENTY TWO WHEN THE INTERNATIONAL BUILDING CODES. WOULD COME INTO EFFECT AROUND MASS TIMBER SO THAT THE. THE THE STRUCTURAL BEAMS MADE OUT OF WOOD THAT COULD REPLACE STEEL BEAMS. THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE ADOPTED IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND THEN. IT'S A STATE WE ADOPT THOSE INTERNATIONAL CODES. AND THAT'S FOR TALLER BUILDINGS IN THE CURRENT THRESHOLD. SELECT SOME PUT A PIN IN THAT BECAUSE I AT SOME. FUTURE POINT IN THE NEAR FUTURE I'D LIKE TO GET MORE INFORMATION WRITE LA UP ABOUT THAT. SO THE NEXT. BUT THAT SOUNDS GOOD IN THE NEXT PROPOSAL WAS FROM THE CINMATIC. SERMON SEEKING A BUILDING ON THE SAFETY OF THAT. WE HAVE. CAPACITY IN OUR ROOM WORLD FORCED ECONOMIES TO BUILD THESE TYPES OF INDUSTRIES. IT'S ONE MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE TIMBER RESTORATION AND TEAR FOR FUND. AND IT IS INTENDED FOR GRANTS TO SUPPORT SPECIFICALLY SUPPORT. WOOD PRODUCTS MANUFACTURING CAPACITY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ENFORCED IT COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA SO THIS FUNDING IS IS IS REALLY MEANT TO DRIVE. YOU KNOW TO HELP THOSE PEOPLE TRYING TO DEVELOP THESE CAMPUSES AND REOPEN THEM WE OPEN MILLS. TOGETHER WILL HELP THEM GET TO THE BAY AREA FACING THE GET TO THOSE AMERICA. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE HEARING FROM MANY LOCALS ON THAT THEY NEED THEY NEED SUPPORT BUT THEY ALSO WITH THEY WILL ALSO NEED ALONG WITH FUNDING IS JUST HELP FROM OUR DEPARTMENTS IN GETTING THROUGH THE. IN THE MANY DIFFERENT REGULATORY AND. AND OTHER BARRIERS THAT WE CAN ASSIST THEM WITH. THEN THE FINAL PROPOSAL BACKED THE MASS TIMBER IS A IS A BUILDING COMPETITION THAT WE WE HONESTLY YOU KNOW COPY THIS IDEA FROM OREGON AND WASHINGTON. THEY CONDUCTED SIMILAR. OREGON I CAN'T REMEMBER WASHINGTON AND OREGON DID ONE. BUT THE IDEA IS THAT YOU IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO PUSH FOR THESE MASS TIMBER. BUILDINGS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND BECAUSE LOCAL PERMITTING IS NOT ACCUSTOMED TO DEALING WITH. HAVE NEW WAYS TO BUILD BUILDINGS CITIES THESE FUNDS WOULD BE. DIRECTED PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN. LOCAL DEVELOPERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO CAN OF SERVICE PILOT PROJECTS SHOWCASE HOW YOU CAN BUILD THESE BILLS BUILDINGS. WE'VE SEEN A FEW. BUILDINGS. GOING UP ACROSS STATE BUT RECENTLY PLUMAS COUNTY. CAN DESTRUCTIVE. AND IT WAS MAGIC TO THE COURTHOUSE BUT IT WAS. IT WAS NOT AN EASY UNDERTAKING AND IT'S NOT EASY TO CONVINCE THE LOCALS TO JUST TO ALLOW SIMITIS BUT WITH A LOT OF. KIND OF PUSHING AND AND HARD WORK THEY WERE ABLE TO GET THEIR BUILDINGS BUILT. THAT WE WANT TO CREATE MORE BORER MORE MODELS OF THAT AROUND THE STATE AND THAT WOULD BE AT THE. GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY SO. YOU WITH THAT THERE'S A LOT OF. LOT OF INFORMATION WE CAN DISCUSS AROUND THE FORCE CARBON PLAN ITSELF. BUT THOUGHT WE COULD WE COULD JUST PAUSE FOR QUESTIONS. AND THEN I GUESS THAT EVERYONE WE HAVE PEOPLE THE CROWD FOR THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS. RESPOND THANK YOU. IT IS THERE. HOW DO ALL THESE PIECES LE A BECOME COORDINATED TO? WHAT AGENCY IS SIR RESPOND RIGHT OFF THAT HOW THAT HAPPENED FIFTH OF? NO HAS A LOT OF PIECES IT IS A LOT OF PIECES GREAT QUESTIONS SO I CAN TIM WHAT A DIRECTOR CAL FIRE. OUGHT SO. CENTER TO ALL OF THIS IS ENGAGING. A FOREST MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE THAT WILL. ESSENTIALLY INVOLVE A A PIVOTING OF THE EXISTING TREE MORTALITY TASK FORCE THAT HAS BEEN EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL. IN DEALING WITH THE CHALLENGES OF HUNDRED TWELVE TWENTY NINE MILLION. TREES DEAD IN THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN SIERRA PRIMARILY. UP BUT THE ISSUE IS OBVIOUSLY BROADER IT'S TAKING OF THE DEAD TREES ARE A SYMPTOM OF THIS BROADER FOREST HEALTH FOREST RESILIENCY. CHALLENGE WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA AND SO IT'S PART OF THE ROLL OUT LAST WEEK AND WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS PIVOTING THE TREE MORTALITY TASK FORCE. HERE IN THE COMING WEEKS TO A BROADER FOREST MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE THAT WILL ENCOMPASS. COORDINATING ALL OF THE EFFORTS IDENTIFIED IN THE FORCE CARBON PLAN WELL AS WELL AS OTHER PLANS THE STATE'S OF STRATEGIC FIRE PLAN. ARE AND BRING AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS. TOGETHER MEAN THAT TREE MORTALITY WILL STILL BE AN EMPHASIS WITHIN THIS BUT WILL BE A MUCH BROADER FOCUSING ON. MIA WOULD PRODUCTS MARKETING FUELS TREATMENT PRESCRIBED FIRE. AT ALL OF THIS GETTING US TO THIS GOAL OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES TREATED TO ANNUALLY ON PRIVATE LAND SO THAT WILL BE. HERE COMING IN THE COMING WEEKS. AS WE. FORMULATE THAT THAT TASK FORCE AND IT WILL BRING TOGETHER THESE AGENCIES TO COORDINATE NOT JUST THE EFFORT BUT. TO IDENTIFY AND HELP STREAMLINE FUNDING AND A TARGET REGIONAL. PROJECTS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THIS TASK FORCE WILL NOT BE ANOTHER LAYER OFBUREAUCRACY IT'S DESIGNED ACTUALLY TO SUPPORT. REGIONAL LOCAL EFFORTS ON THE GROUND THAT ARE SUCCESSFUL TO REALLY LEVERAGE MAXIMUM BENEFIT AND AGAIN WOULD HELP THE LOCAL SUPPORT. ARE GETTING THIS WORK DONE. THANK YOU. WHEN THE. PART PART OF THE SET UP PLANNED. WHICH SHOWED EVEN SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON HIS HAS TO DO WITH REFORESTATION CORRECT. BOB CAN YOU JUST STOOD DESCRIBED WHAT IS. ENVISIONED. SO ARE AT SEVERAL THINGS ARE OBVIOUSLY REFORESTATION IS A BROADER COMPONENT. IT'S ONE OF THE MANY COMPONENTS IN IN TREATING OUR FORCE LANCE AND SO WE ONE. DUBBED HILLS RIGHT INTO A CAL FIRE RE ESTABLISHING OF THE DAVIS NURSERY TO GROW SEEDLINGS WE ARE REALLY TARGETING. THE OF THE. HERE ONE MILLION ACRES OF FOREST LAND IN THE STATE ALL LANDS COMBINED NINE MILLION ACRES OF THAT ARE SMALL. FAMILY FOREST LAND OWNERS OFFIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED ACRES IN SIZE. OUT WE ARE REALLY FOCUSING THIS EFFORT TO HELP SUPPORT CAPACITY. FOR THOSE LANDOWNERS TO BE ABLE TO REFOREST. AFTER THE INSECT AND DISEASE I'M CAUSE MORTALITY DEVASTATING FIRE O. OR LANDS THAT ARE JUST UNDER. FORESTED BECAUSE OVER TIME. THAT INVASIVE SPECIES AND OTHER. SPECIES HAVE COMMANDED AND DISPLACED ACCOUNTED FORRISEN AND ANOTHER. TREE SPECIES AND SO THIS EFFORT WILL INCLUDE A VERY. EXTENSIVE AND ROBUST COMPONENT IN WORKING TOWARDS THAT WE FOR STING LANZA THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND AS WE RESTORE FOR US. I PRESUME THAT WERE OUT NOT ONLY LOOKING AT. VALUE OF FLAT CARBON SEQUESTRATION BUT ALSO. OF THE VALUE IN THAT. STORING WATER. THAT THEN GETS CLEANED AND CIRCULATE SO. YEAH A DOWN SO THAT THE CORRECT FORCE CARTON PLAN WAS. MAYBE MAYBE TO NARROW THE TITLE FOR THE PLAN BECAUSE THE FOCUS OF THE PLAN WAS REALLY TO. LOOK AT OUR FORCES ECOSYSTEM Y. SYSTEMS THAT WE WOULD YOU KNOW SEEK TO RESTORE TO ALL OF THE AND TO PROTECT ALL OF THE BENEFITS THAT WE DEPEND ON FROM US FOR SO. NOT ONLY THE CARBON SEQUESTRATION BUT. THE ECOSYSTEM THE HABITAT THE WATER YOU KNOW QUALITY AND WATER SUPPLY AND EVERYTHING ELSE THANK THANK YOU. YOU'RE DESCRIBING IT MUCH MORE ORPHALI THAN I DID. TIME. WHICH SHOULD BE THE CASE. BUT TO OF THEM. THERE ARE ALL ARE ALL OF THOSE. AT BENEFITS AND INTENTIONS WRITTEN INTO THE PLAN YES. I'VE ARE THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO MENTION IS SOMETHING THAT I I REALLY WAS JUST A BRIEF DON. AS RECENTLY AS LAST FRIDAY BY A SOME SCIENTISTS AT UCLA. AND THAT IS THE ISSUE OF HOW WE THINK ABOUT. OUR RESTORATION OF FORCE OF ARE WE RESTORING FORESTS TO. THE CONDITION THAT WE FOUND THE MEN TODAY ARE CONTEMPORANEOUSLY OR ARE WE LOOKING FORWARD. THROUGH THE LENS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. AND RESTORING FOREST SO THAT THEY WILL BE RESILIENT. TEN YEARS TWENTY YEARS AND FIFTY YEARS FROM NOW. IT'S VERY GOOD QUESTION AND WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO. THE FORESTS A OF TODAY OR YESTERDAY ARE NOT WHERE THEY WILL BE. TOMORROW AND SO WE ARE LOOKING AT THIS. AND IT WOULD WOULD NEVER BEEN CHALLENGED BY A HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION TREES DYING. AND REALLY WHAT'S ONE EPISODE IT'S CHANGING THAT THE LANDSCAPE FOR THE CENTRAL. AND SOUTHERN SIERRA BUT IT'S REALLY STATEWIDE IMPACTS THAT WE'RE SEEING AND SO THIS INVOLVES LOOKING AT WHAT ARE THE APPROPRIATE TREE SPECIES. AND AND OTHER SHRUB AND PLANT SPECIES ARE AT ELEVATION AND LATITUDE THAT'S DIFFERENT GOING FORWARD AND THAT'S LOOKING AT CHANGING WEATHER PATTERNS TEMPERATURES ARE. LITERALLY THE CHANGING CLIMATE IS IMPACTING WHAT WILL GROW AT DIFFERENT ELEVATION AND IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS AND SO IT'S TRYING TO MODEL WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE IN THE DESIRED STATE INTO THE FUTURE AND ENGAGING IN. WHAT WE NEED TO DO NOW TO TAKE TO GET THERE AND MAKE UP SURVIVABLE? AND THIS IS AND THIS IS REALLY WHERE WE'VE. WE'RE IN A GREAT POSITION BECAUSE WE AS A STATE OF INVESTED IN. CLIMATE SCIENCE SO WE HAVE. NOT ONLY NOT ONLY STATE FUNDED BUT ALSO IN THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS WE HAVE REALLY GOOD DATA ON WHAT. TO EXPECT ACROSS OUR DIFFERENT LANDSCAPE AND HOW ECOSYSTEMS WILL MOVE. FOR GOING TO BE RELEASING A OF THE BIG TRUNKS OF THAT RESOURCE THIS SUMMER IN THE FOURTH CLIMATE CHANGE SETTLEMENT AT ALL REALLY SHOWCASE WILDFIRE. NO WE SHOULD EXPECT WILDFIRES BUT ALSO WE SHOULD EXPECT FROM TEMPERATURE INCREASES AND HABITAT MIGRATION AND EVERYTHING ELSE SO. IF TRIPS TOGETHER NICELY GREAT PATH I THANK YOU AND. FINALLY. WITH MY A SUB THREE AND MY HOUSING HATS ON AT THE SAME TIME. AYE AYE AYE WHAT'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE. OF FORCED PRODUCT INNOVATION. OF A PROPOSAL WHICH I THINK IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO US. AND WE CERTAINLY HAVE THE THE RESOURCES HERE FOR IMPLEMENTING AT A VERY ROBUST INNOVATIVE PROGRAM AND CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE ONE OF THE CENTERS. GIVEN THE THE AMOUNT OF FOR. THAT THE SIZEABLE FORCE THAT WE HAVE IN THE IN THE STATE. BUT IT OF STRIKES ME THAT. OF THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE. SOME NEW INDUSTRIES. THAT OUR OWN HOUSING AND BUILDING INDUSTRIES CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE FACE IN THE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS. IS THE EXTRAORDINARY COST OF CONSTRUCTION. TO BUILD A. AREA MULTI FAMILY HOUSING UNIT A SINGLE UNIT A IS COSTING SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND. IN SOME CASES. OVER SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER UNIT I'VE AND. UP PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO DE RESTRICTED HOUSING BUT REALLY ANY HOUSING THE HIGHER THE UNDERLYING COSTS ARE THE MORE PRESSURE THERE IS ON THAT ON RENTS AND TO. A PURCHASE PRICES. THERE IS AT THE SAME TIME THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING. A THE STUFF FORCE PRODUCT INNOVATIONS THERE'S ALSO A BUDDING INDUSTRY AND PREFABRICATED TO. UP PANELS OFFER HOUSING THIS ISN'T OLD STYLE PREFAB IT'S NEW AND INNOVATIVE AND I DON'T NEED TO GET INTO DETAILS HERE. BUT IT STRIKES ME THAT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY IN CALIFORNIA TO CREATE AN ENTIRELY NEW. INNOVATIVE INDUSTRY THAT WILL BENEFIT NOT ONLY OUR FORESTS BUT ARE HOUSING ISSUES. AND SO I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU AND SUGGEST THAT. YOU LOOK INTO THAT AND A COORDINATE THIS PROJECT AROUND THAT AS A A AS AN ULTIMATE GOAL ONE OF MANY GOALS BUT. ABOUT WHAT COULD BE A VERY IMPORTANT GOAL. AND NOW. IF THERE'S NO QUESTIONS FROM THE DICE. WE'LL HEAR FROM ALEJO. GREAT. I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MONEY MEMBERS ACTUALLY ENDS WITH THE ANALYST'S OFFICE. I THINK WE. AGREE WITH A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE EVEN SAID. WE ARE RECOMMENDING APPROVING MOST OF THE PROPOSAL WE. AGREE THAT BRIGHTENS OF THOSE EXIST ABOUT THE PROBLEMATIC CONDITIONS OF THE STATE'S FORESTS. IN THAT THE PACE AND SCALE HAVE NOT BEEN ENOUGH TO KEEP UP WITH THOSE PROBLEMS. WE ALSO FIND THAT THIS PROPOSAL HAS A LOT OF. ITEMS IN IT THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE'VE MADE RECENTLY AND THE ANALYST'S REPORT REGARDING PERSON WATERSHED MANAGEMENT. AND THERE WAS ONE COMPONENT OF THE PACKAGE THAT WE DID HAVE SOME OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS ON AND THAT WAS THE TWENTY MILLION AND YOU ARE OF MONIES. A FOR RESOURCES AGENCY FOR THE REGIONAL FOREST HEALTH PROJECTS. ISN'T A REVIEW IT SEEMS LIKE ABOUT HER THE PROPOSAL JUST OR CONCEPTUAL PHASE RIGHT NOW AND DEMONSTRATION IS STILL DEVELOPING EXACTLY WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE AND HOW IT WOULD WORK. AND SO WE HAVE RECOMMENDED THE COMMITTEE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER ASKING SOME QUESTIONS OF THE ADMINISTRATION SPECIFICALLY ON WHAT STEPS WERE LEFT TO. A BE ABLE COMPLETELY DEVELOPED THIS PROGRAM AND HOW LONG THAT WOULD TAKE. WHEN SHE EXPECTS OF THE TIMING OF THE GRANT MONEY INTO IT TO GO OUT AND WHICH WE START SEEING PROJECTS HAPPEN HOW MUCH OF THAT WOULD BE IN THE BUDGET YEAR. AND FINALLY A HALL OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF VISION PRIORITIZING VARIOUS WATERSHEDS ON AREAS OF THE STATE'S FOR THESE PROJECTS AND THIS FUNDING. THEY DID PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO US REGARDING THOSE QUESTIONS ARE CURRENTLY THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING THAT AND. MIA HAPPY TO UPDATE THE COMMITTEE LATER AS WE AS WE DO THAT BUT THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO ASK AS WELL. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ALPHA YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WERE SUPPORTIVE OF THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL AND BELIEVE THAT. ALL OF THAT SORT OF FUNDING PROPOSED INCLUDING AND THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND FOR AGENCY WILL REALLY HELP US. AND TO MEET OUR STATEWIDE TARGETS IN TERMS OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTION TARGETS AND OVERALL FORCE HEALTH OUTCOMES. THANK YOU IF THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM AT THIS TIME AND THEN. AS WE GO FORWARD THROUGH THE AGENDA WE WILL I TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE END OF EACH SHOT DEPARTMENTS PRESENTATION ON ALL OF. THEIR ISSUES. AND BEFORE YOU BEGIN. WERE INTEGRAL. SO. HERE FALL HERE KALRA. MULLIN PATTERSON. RIGHT AND DOUBLE DO THE VOTE ONLY CALENDAR. WHEN. WE'RE DONE WITH PUBLIC COMMENT. MIKE GERMAN BLOOM MEMBERS MANY PAUL MASON FOR PACIFIC FOR A STRESSED HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS YOU KNOW THOUGHTFUL AND MULTIFACETED PROPOSALS AUGMENTATION IN THE MAY REVISE. I DO I PARTICULARLY. SUPPORT THE. PROPOSAL FOR TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO THE RESOURCES AGENCY TO HELP CATALYZE SOME PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION. OF ACTUAL FOR WATERSHED AND REGIONAL PLANS AND OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE THEN THE FEAR NEVADA WHICH IS AHEAD OF THE GAME ON THAT. YOU KNOW HAVING SOME RESOURCES TO HELP. INSTIGATE SOME OF THAT COLLABORATION AND PLANNING IS REALLY ESSENTIAL BECAUSE THESE THINGS JUST DON'T COME TOGETHER. ON THEIR OWN OR WITHOUT SOME LEVEL OF RESOURCES TO HELP ARE CATALYZE THAT SO THAT THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. I ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT BETWEEN THE CURRENT. BUDGET YEAR WHERE CAL FIRE GOT A REALLY SUBSTANTIAL ALLOCATION AND THIS ALLOCATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REALLY SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN THE FOREST AND. THANKED ME VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE ACHIEVING THOSE SORT OF MULTI BENEFIT. OUTCOMES OF THE CHAIR VIOLATED FOUR WATERSHEDS FOR WILDLIFE FOR FOR SELF AND FOR FIRE BEHAVIOR. AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE SOME INTERDISCIPLINARY INPUT INTO HOW WE'RE DESIGNING IN SELECTING THOSE PROJECTS I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY CRITICAL. AND SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE PROBABLY WANTS TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE ON. BUT IN GENERAL I THINK IT'S REALLY A FANTASTIC PROPOSAL VERY SUPPORTIVE THANK YOU. GOING TO MISS YOU CHAIR MEMBERS JULIE MALINOWSKI BALL THE HAVE TO CALIFORNIA BY A MASS ENERGY ALLIANCE WANNA EXPRESS OUR SUPPORT FOR THIS PROPOSAL. WE ACTUALLY WANTS HIM TO COVER HER FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. THE FUNDING AND THIS WILL GO A LONG WAY AND IN PARTICULAR THE BIOMASS INDUSTRY STANDS UP BY READY AT TO ASSIST WITH ANY FUEL REDUCTION PROJECTS IN MAKING SURE THAT THE WASTE. OF FROM THAT FROM THOSE PROJECTS I GET BENEFICIAL REUSE PROJECTS. WITH BIOMASS FACILITIES THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING ELENA ORTIZ ON BEHALF OF THE NATURE CONSERVANCY AND THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS A VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS ITEM. SPECIFICALLY ON BEHALF OF THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT OUR SUPPORT FOR THE PROPOSED FUNDING FOR WATERSHED COORDINATOR GRANTS. AND OUR CITIES HAVE SUCCESSFULLY EMPLOYED WATERSHED COORDINATOR GRANTS IN THE BENEFIT THESE POSITIONS SERVE CANNOT BE OVERSTATED. BUT TO TRULY GET THE MOST BENEFIT FROM THESE GRANTS THIS FUNDING NEEDS TO BE CARRIED FORWARD IN FUTURE YEARS. YEAR AFTER YEAR FUNDING AND NOT A ONE TIME APPROPRIATION IS NEEDED TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFIT THAT WATERSHED COORDINATOR CRACKS PROVIDES YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT TO HAVE BRING SELF PUBLIC COMMENT TO CLOSE ON THIS ITEM THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION THIS MORNING GO WILL BE TAKING NO ACTION TODAY BUT TO THINK WE'LL COME BACK. TO THE. OF PLANNED. IN THE THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS. WE'RE GOING TO. PAUSE AND TAKE THE VOTE ONLY CALENDAR NOW IF THERE'S A MOTION COMMENTER ROCK. CALL OUT AT AN ERROR IN THE AGENDA. ON ISSUE NUMBER NINE OF THE VOTE ONLY CALENDAR THE REPORT INCORRECTLY. AND SAYS SIR. HOLD OPEN AND IT. SHOULD HAVE FOR REFERENCE TO VOTE ONLY CALENDAR IT WOULD. THAT THAT. WE WOULD BE VOTING TO APPROVE IT. I AM SO WITH THAT UNDERSTANDING IS THERE A MOTION TO APPROVE. ISSUES ONE THROUGH ELEVEN ON THE VOTE ON THE COUNTER AND MAKE THEM SECOND. VOTE MOTION BY PATTERSON AND A SECOND BY FONG AND LOOK. BLOOM. AYE. FONG. KALRA. MULLIN PATTERSON. AHEAD OF A MOTION. THANK YOU. YES WILL OVERHAULED LISTA OPEN SO THAT TO MISTER MILLIKEN AND ON WHEN HE GETS HERE. AND WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD WE'VE GOTTA TWO ISSUES WITH THE ARMY GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN WOMEN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS EASY CHIANG A DEPUTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER AT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND I'LL START WITH A FARMER ITEM. SO EMISSIONS FROM AGRICULTURE EQUIPMENT ARE A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF AIR POLLUTION PARTICULARLY IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. WERE OVER TWENTY PERCENT OF THE SMOG FORMING KNOCKS IN PM EMISSIONS COME FROM AGRICULTURAL ENGINES. REDUCING THESE EMISSIONS OF NECESSARY TO MEET OUR HEALTH BASED AIR QUALITY STANDARDS AND OUR STATE GREENHOUSE GAS GOALS. AND WE'VE ADOPTED STANDARDS SO THAT NEW ENGINES ARE CLEANER BUT THE TURNOVER OF ENGINES IN AND THE VALLEY IS SLOW AND MANY AGRICULTURAL PIECES OF EQUIPMENT ARE USED FOR DECADES. ON BECAUSE OF THE AGRICULTURAL BUSINESSES SUBJECT VOLATILITY. UNPREDICTABLE WEATHER LIKE WE'RE EXPERIENCING TODAY VARYING COMMODITY PRICES AND GLOBAL COMPETITION. AGRICULTURAL BUSINESSES ARE OFTEN RELUCTANT TO PURCHASE NEW EQUIPMENT UNTIL IT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. BECAUSE OF THIS THE NATURAL TURNOVER OF AG EQUIPMENT IS VERY VERY SLOW AND IT'S REALLY TOO SLOW O MEET THE STATE'S CLEAN AIR NEEDS. INCENTIVES HAVE BEEN ONE WAY THAT WE'VE SUCCESSFULLY ENCOURAGED TURNOVER. BEFORE THE END OF THE USEFUL LIFE OF THIS EQUIPMENT AND MANY OF THE PROGRAMS THAT FIND AG ENGINE REPLACEMENT ARE OVERSUBSCRIBED YEAR AFTER YEAR. I'M OUR BOARD RECENTLY APPROVED GUIDELINES TO IMPLEMENT WHAT WE CALL THE FARMER PROGRAM. ON THAT WOULD EXPAND FUNDS AT THAT WERE PROVIDED A LAST YEAR THAT WAS DONE AT THE MARCH BOARD MEETING. PROVIDE PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDS ON IN THIS FISCAL IN NEXT FISCAL YEAR WILL HELP SPEED AIR QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR AGRICULTURAL REGIONS AND ALSO HELP REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. THANK THANK YOU. LA OWE ANY COMMENTS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN RICH ROSS BROWN WITH THE ALEJO AS YOUR AGENDA NOTES THIS THE. THIRTY MILLION GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION WOULD BE IN ADDITION TO A ONE ONE HUNDRED TWO MILLION. GIGI R. F. PROPOSED APPROPRIATION BY THE GOVERNOR. WE. LEGISLATURE CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCES THAT THIS IS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE THEN IT COULD CONSIDER REALLOCATING GTR UP FUNDS FROM OTHER. ACTIVITIES FOR THIS PURPOSE UP FOR EXAMPLE. IF OF MYTH IF PRODUCING AGRICULTURAL MISSION FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY THE HIGH PRIORITY THE LEGISLATURE COULD REALLOCATE THOSE FUNDS NOW THAT WOULD. LEAVE LESS MONEY FOR OTHER CLIMATE RELATED ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD FREE UP GENERAL FUND FOR OTHER LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. THANK YOU WOULD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK MONNING JULIANA MORRISSEY ME WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THIS IS. THIS IS A ONE TIME. FUNDING FOR THE GENERAL FUND AND IT'S APPROPRIATE SO IT'S IT'S NOT GOING TO CREATE ONGOING PRESSURES. IT ALSO SUPPORTS IT HASSAM CHO CHO BENEFITS SO IT NOT ONLY REDUCES THE GHG EMISSIONS. IN THE VALLEY BUT IT ALSO. IT ALSO. WILL REDUCE THE AIR POLLUTION ESPECIALLY. COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AT. AFFECTED. SO THE ADMINISTRATION IS HIGHLY ALLERGIC TO. OUR. VIA USE OF GENERAL FUND TYPICALLY WHY IS THIS DIFFERENT. WELL THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND. BUT THE GOALS THAT WE HAVE. WELL THAT WOULD. MAKE THAT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S MORE APPROPRIATE FOR JDRF. THEY ALSO THE DEPARTMENT IS ALSO. RECEIVING A HUNDRED AND TWO MILLION. IN JGR OTHERS THIS DIAGRAM. SO. WHY? REACH INTO GENERAL FUND AS OPPOSED TO ALLOCATE. TO. JDRF FUNDS. MAYBE. EITHER OF YOU CAN TAKE A STAB AT THAT. RIGHT THE ADDITIONAL WOULD TALK ABOUT THE ADDITIONAL THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. I. MATT ONLY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO IF YOU LOOK AT THAT KIND OF THE MAY REVISION FRAMEWORK. THE ADMINISTRATION HAS A LOT OF ONE TIME INVESTMENTS ACROSS A BROAD SERIES OF PROGRAMS THAT INCLUDES DEFERRED MAINTENANCE INCLUDES FLOOD CONTROL INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH WILL BE HEARING. AND. THIS PROGRAM IS ALSO AS. MISS MERCYME A MENTION IT IS ONE TIME MONEY AND SO. IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE OVERALL FRAMEWORK OF HOW WE'RE GONNA SPEND ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR ONE TIME. TYPE PROGRAMS. IN IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THESE ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE. ADMINISTRATION'S CLIMATE POLICY GOALS. AS WELL AS THE MULTIPLE BENEFITS IN TERMS OF REDUCING AIR POLLUTION IN AND DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED COMMUNITIES. IT KINDA CHECKED ALL THE BOXES FROM OUR OF INTO EACH POINT. SO I I I'M STILL TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. BECAUSE. AT ON ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE OF THE BUDGET HERE AND I'M SURE THIS IS TRUE IN THE SENATE TO WE'RE. TRYING TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO ACHIEVE MUTUAL OUTCOMES. I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CRITERIA ARE FOR I'M REACHING AND TO THE GENERAL FUND. OF ONE KIND OR ARE WE TO HOW WE WILL HOW ARE WE TO LOOK AT GENERAL FUND MONEY IN THESE MATTERS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION'S PERSPECTIVE. UP FOCUS ON A ONE TIME. EXPENDITURES FOR PROGRAMS THAT ACHIEVE US SOME OF THE. BOTH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE'S OVERARCHING POLICY GOALS RELATED TO. VARIOUS ISSUES BUT CLIMATE WOULD BE ONE OF THEM. AS WELL AS. PROGRAMS THAT ACHIEVE MULTIPLE BENEFITS BEYOND CLIMATE SUCH AS. HELPING. IMPROVE AIR QUALITY AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU. THIS IS. QUESTION THAT WOULD APPLY OUTSIDE OF SOME OF THE SPECIFIC ISSUES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TOO BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE. A POTENTIAL USE OF GENERAL FUND MONEY CUTS ACROSS ALL DEPARTMENTS IN ALL THE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEES. LET SAYS IF FOR SOME PUBLIC COMMENT DEFICIENT. DR. ISSUES TWO AND THREE. WE CAN DO THAT'S RIGHT WHAT I'M I'M SORRY DE MINDED WAY FOR. TRY TO BE CONSISTENT THANK YOU I'M SORRY TO GET ISSUE NUMBER THREE. SIDETRACKED WITH THE GENERAL FUND. OKAY A SEPARATION THREE ADVANCE PAY ON IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. BUSTERS BUDGET ACT AUTHORIZED CARD TO MAKE ADVANCE PAYMENTS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. AND THIS PURPOSE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT IS FRONT OF THE COMMITTEE TODAY WOULD AUTHORIZE CARP TO MAKE ADVANCE PAYMENTS ON A PERMANENT BASIS. I'M ALL OF THE CONDITIONS THAT EXISTED LAST YEAR THAT MAKE ADVANCE PAIN NECESSARY STILL EXISTS TODAY FOR THOSE PROJECTS. I'M OUR GRANTEES OFTEN NEED ACCESS TO CAPITAL TO TAKE ON PROJECTS I'M ONE OF THE EXAMPLES THAT WE HAVE IS A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM GRANTS THAT WE HAVE UNDER THE SIX ONE SEVEN. ON COMMUNITY AIR PROTECTION PROGRAM UNDIES TECHNICAL GRANTS PROVIDE EDUCATION OUTREACH AND ALSO FINE CITIZEN SCIENCE ON COMMUNITY BASED MONITORING AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. ON THE GRANTEES ARE SMALL AND NON PROFITS THAT OFTEN DO NOT HAVE THE UP FRONT RESOURCES TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT THIS PROGRAM. UNLESS THEY CAN RECEIVE UP BOND FUNDS UP FRONT. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS SMALL AIR DISTRICTS ON SMALL I'M AIR DISTRICTS IMPLEMENT ON THEIR THE ON TO ROUND IMPLEMENTOR OF MANY. OF OUR PROGRAMS ON SMALL DISTRICTS DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS LIKE THE CLEAN SCHOOL BUS PROGRAM. IF THEY CAN GET FUNDS UP FRONT. I'M HAVING SPECIFIC AND PERMANENT STATUTORY AUTHORITY WOULD RELIEVE ANY CONFUSION ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO PAY IN ADVANCE ON THE PROPOSED STATUTORY LANGUAGE INCLUDE SAFEGUARDS TO ENSURE THAT ADVANCE PAY IS ONLY PROVIDED TO GRANTEES IN GOOD FINANCIAL STANDING. THAT PROJECTS WILL BE SUCCESSFULLY DELIVERED AND THAT IF THE GRANTEE DOES NOT PERFORM THAT WE CAN RECOVER THE UNSPENT FUNDS. I'M THERE WILL ALSO BE PROGRAMMATIC IN FISCAL CONSTRAINTS IN THE GRANTS THEMSELVES THAT SAFEGUARD THE TAKE TAXPAYERS MONEY WITH REGARD TO ADVANCE PAYMENT AND SUCCESSFUL DELIVERY OF PROJECTS. THANK YOU. ALEJO NO CONCERNS BERMAN FINANCE. NOW WE'LL HEAR PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS IS TWO OR THREE. AND THEN THAT WHEN WE WERE DONE LAST MISTER MONA FEWEST AT ON THE. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE KNOW WELL KRAMER'S OF THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION ON I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION THEIR RESOURCES BOARD FOR QUICKLY IMPLEMENTING THE FARMER PROGRAM AND ALSO GIVE THEM A LOT OF CREDIT FOR THEIR CREATIVITY IN COMING UP WITH. THE ACRONYM FARMER. IT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE. A. ALTHOUGH THE ACRONYMS AND. EQUIVALENT. SO. UN. THERE WAS A LOT OF DISCUSSION AND AN EXPLANATION AS TO WHY FARMERS DON'T REPLACE THEIR EQUIPMENT AND. ON A A A REGULAR BASIS THEY REALLY GET THE MOST THEY CAN OUT OF THEIR TRACTORS AND TRUCKS. AND DIESEL PUMPS AND SO THIS PROGRAM WILL BE INCREDIBLY HELPFUL IN GETTING THEM TO REPLACE. BUT THOSE ENGINES IT WILL BENEFIT NOT ONLY GREENHOUSE GAS BUT ALSO CRITERIA POLLUTANTS. AND I NO THAT THERE IS SIGNIFICANT INTEREST IN NYC AND EXPECT THAT THAT PROGRAM THE CURRENT FUNDING WILL BE OVERSUBSCRIBED IN AND THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY I GET CALLS AND EMAILS DAILY FROM MY MEMBERS ASKING ABOUT HOW. TO APPLY FOR THIS PROGRAM AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE SOME AIR DISTRICTS ARE ALREADY ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS. AND SO THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY AND I'M WE STRONGLY SUPPORT IT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION NO AND HE TO COME BEHALF OF WESTERN ART PROCESSORS ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA CONGENERS IN GROWERS ASSOCIATION. CALIFORNIA TOMATO GROWERS ASSOCIATION AND VARIOUS OTHER AG AGENCIES. IN STRONG SUPPORT OF ITEM NUMBER TO ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THE FARMER PROGRAM AND FOR THESE I DIESEL ENGINE TRADE UPS. AS FARM BUREAU SAID THIS IS BEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL INCENTIVE PROGRAM THROUGH THE CARL MOYER PROGRAM. AND WERE VERY POSITIVE WITH THE FARMER PROGRAM IN THE GUIDELINES BECAUSE ACTUALLY WE THINK THAT MORE DIESEL ENGINES WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR FOR FUNDING. WHICH IS A HUGE DEAL FOR FARMERS WHO MAY ONLY USE THEIR TRACTOR YOU KNOW THREE MONTHS OUT OF THE YEAR FOR SPECIFIC THINGS SO. TRADING THAT AND TRYING TO GET THOSE BETTER QUALITIES IS A VERY VERY BIG BEST MEN. AND FOR A LOT OF SMALL AND EVEN MEDIUM SIZED FARMERS THE COST OF TREATING UP THOSE TRACTORS MAY NOT BE COST EFFECTIVE AND THEY MAY DECIDE THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT BUSINESS ANYMORE JUST BECAUSE OF THE COST OF UPDATING THEIR EQUIPMENT. AND SO THIS FUNDING IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. AS WAS SAID TO YOU WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE FUNDING FROM LAST YEAR THAT'S GOING TO GO OUT TO THE FARMER PROGRAM IS ALREADY OVERSUBSCRIBED. AND THAT WITH THE FUNDING THROUGH THE GDR F. PLAN PLUS THIS FUNDING TO THE GENERAL FUND. WILL AGAIN BE OVER PRESCRIBE BECAUSE THERE IS JUST SO MUCH INTEREST IN USING THESE PROGRAMS AND GETTING. THOSE. EMISSION REDUCTIONS EXPRESSLY IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES YOU.

ON OUR. ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA WITHOUT ONE STATED CONCERN AND THAT IS THAT MANY OF THE VEHICLES THAT WHERE. TAKING OUT OF COMMISSION AND CALIFORNIA. AYE AND AND PARTICULARLY IT WAS SAID DISCUSSED I THINK TO DISCUSS WAS AROUND DIESEL VEHICLES. WERE ENDING UP ON THEIR HIGHWAYS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT BEING CRUSHED AS I UNDERSTAND IT THERE ARE BEING RESOLD INTO AND AND TO THE MARKET. THIS IS A LONG TERM ISSUE THAT I THINK. WE NEED TO GIVE SOME THOUGHT TO BECAUSE IT IT DEFINITELY IS A POSITIVE THAT WE ARE. CYCLING OUT OF. THE DIRTIER VEHICLES HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT IF THEY REMAIN ON THE ROAD THERE STILL CONTRIBUTING TO. A CARBON EMISSIONS SOMEWHERE AND WILL GET FAR MORE BENEFIT IF WE FIND A WAY TO TAKE THOSE VEHICLES OUT OF COMMISSION. ENTIRELY. I'D ASK YOU TO. GIVE THIS SOME THOUGHT AND DATA. OF PERHAPS INCORPORATE SOME. A WAY OF DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE IN THAT ARE IN THE IN THE FUTURE. NOW IF THAT DEFINITELY POINT TAKEN THERE ARE SOME OF OUR PROGRAMS IN WHICH ON THE VEHICLE THAT ARE THE ENGINE THAT IS REPLACE HOUSE TO BE DESTROYED AND THEIR HOUSE ACTUALLY BEAT SORT OF A VISUAL INSPECTION TO ENSURE THAT INVITE DRILL HOLES THROUGH THE ENGINE BLOCKS AND THINGS LIKE.

OF THIS IS IS A RODENT THAT ACTUALLY IS CLASSIFIED AS AN EIGHT RATED PASSED FOR THE DAMAGE THAT IT CAN CAUSE TO GROW CROPS TO ORCHARDS TO VINEYARDS INTO THE FIELD INFRASTRUCTURE. BUT IT'S EQUALLY FRIGHTENING THE DAMAGE THAT IT CAN TO TRY LEVY SYSTEMS AND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THIS GETS INTO THE SAN JOAQUIN. DELTA WHICH IT'S A PERILOUSLY CLOSE ON THE DEPARTMENT IS REQUESTING FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND AND ONE POSITION. FOR TWO YEARS IT'S LIMITED TERMS SO THAT WE CAN AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE GET INTO THE FIELD TO HELP WITH CERVANTES DETECTION WORK TO SUPPORT THE EFFORTS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE.

THE MAY REVISE ALSO INCLUDED INCLUDED A ONE TIME REQUEST FOR FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND SUPPORT. TO FUND THE PARTNERSHIPS ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF IT SUSTAINABLE FUNDING PLAN. THAT PARTNERSHIP WAS CREATED ALMOST TEN YEARS AGO. AT A TIME WHERE THERE WAS RECOGNITION OF THE SIGNIFICANT POVERTY AND DISADVANTAGE. COMMUNITY ISSUES AND THE NEED FOR I'M TRYING TO DIVERSIFY THE ECONOMY OF THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY IT'S A UNIQUE PARTNERSHIP IN THAT IT HAS EQUAL REPRESENTATION FROM STATE GOVERNMENT WITH SEVEN AGENCIES REPRESENTED ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR. IT'S DONE AN OUTSTANDING STRATEGIC PLAN THAT'S BASED AROUND THE TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE OF ECONOMIC VITALITY. ENVIRONMENTAL. THAT A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIAL JUSTICE. WHILE AGRICULTURE WILL ALWAYS BE THE FOUNDATION AND THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTOR TO THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY BY ADDING MORE VALUE TO THE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION IN THE VALLEY. ADVANCED MANUFACTURING THAT AS GROWTH IN THE STATE CONTINUES COME INTO THE VALLEY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE FOCUS ON SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. HEALTHCARE AND AN EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT WILL MAKE SURE THAT EVERY CITIZEN IN THE VALLEY HAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR GOOD JOBS IN THE VALLEY. WE'VE ALSO SEEN SOME EARLY SUCCESSES AND HOW THE BALLY WITH THESE EIGHT COUNTIES HAS BEEN ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER. I TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS TO PRIORITIZE AND BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE COMPETITIVE PROCESS THAT WAY. IF IT'S OKAY I WOULD LIKE TO ASK A SUPERVISOR KEY SUCH MAKE TO SEACM COMMITMENTS YET WORSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR.

ON TRANSPORTATION WE TALK ABOUT HEALTHCARE AIR QUALITY WATER QUALITY IF SOMEBODY WATER QUALITY ISSUES ALONG WITH WATER QUANTITY ISSUES. HIGH SPEED INTERNET FOR ALL WHICH COMES THE EDUCATION COMPONENT BUT WORKING TOGETHER THAT THROUGH THE COLLABORATION WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY A HIGHWAY NINETY NINE I FIVE THE TRADE QUARTERS. SOME CORTES AND STICKING TOGETHER WE KNOW. AND WE KNOW THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IF WE STICK TOGETHER WE CAN MOVE MOUNTAINS I SAY THAT ABOUT THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY ALL THE TIME. GLAD TO HAVE THE SECRETARY ON BOARD SHE'S BEEN A STALWART SUPPORTER OF THIS. AND AGAIN THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO THE THE RISING TIDE TO LIFT ALL BOATS AND SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR A.

AT IT WITHOUT THEM PREJUDICE OF THE MASS OF THE PROPOSAL IS JUST ANCHOR TO US BY FINDING THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS TO ENABLE THAT CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP. FOR THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY TO DEVELOP A PERMANENT FUNDING PLAN SHOULD SHOULD BE A STATE RESPONSIBILITY. THAT INSTEAD OF A LOCAL GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITY ARE ARE I'VE. NGOS WITHIN THE REGION APSA ETCETERA JUST RECOMMENDING THAT YOU WAY THIS GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURE AGAINST OTHER GENERAL FUND. PRIORITIES THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY HAVE. THANK YOU HAS A DEPARTMENT FINANCE. JOHN FITZPATRICK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I THINK. FROM FINANCES PERSPECTIVE ONE DYNAMIC ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT THE. IN IN THE ABSENCE OF OF THE PROVISION OF THESE FUNDS THE ON GOING. ADVOCACY OF THE. OVERALL. EFFORTS WOULD BE IMPACTED SO THIS IS REALLY. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE SOMETHING THAT WILL ENSURE THAT THEY CAN MAINTAIN. EFFORTS AT THEIR CURRENT LEVELS AND HAVE THE IMPACT IN THE REGION THAT THEY'RE SEEKING. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS. I HAVE ONE AND WE HAD A NICE A AYE INTERCHANGE AROUND AND EARLIER ACRONYM. WOULD YOU LIKE TO. PRONOUNCE THIS ACRONYM FOR ME. WHICH ONE NOT FARMERS CPS JV.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRDS MARK SMITH ON BEHALF THE GRASS AND WATER DISTRICT WERE HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE. FIRST PROPOSAL THE REQUEST TO DEAL WITH THE INVASIVE PESTS NUTRIA. I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THOUGH THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME TIGHTER. COORDINATION BETWEEN. CDFA IN CDF W. AND I KNOW THAT THAT'S ALREADY OCCURRING BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE MAP WHERE THE IDENTIFIED SIGHTINGS AND CAPTURES OF TAKING PLACE. MANY OF THEM ARE CARRYING IN THE GRASS AND ECOLOGICAL AREA WHICH IS A SEASONAL WETLAND THAT IS MANAGED FOR BOTH A SUMMER AND FALL WETLANDS AND THAT'S EXACTLY THE TYPE OF HABITAT WHERE THIS AQUATIC RODENT LIKES TO HANG OUT SO. WELL WE UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THE IMPACT TO THE AGRICULTURE COMMUNITY WE'D LIKE CITY OF W'S FULL PARTICIPATION IN ENNIS IN ASSESSING. IMPACTS ON BOTH THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE WETLANDS AQUATIC HABITAT CENTER LOCATED THERE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHERE A MAJORITY OF THE SIGHTINGS ARE ACTUALLY TAKING PLACE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

AROUND COORDINATION OF. CDF FANCY THE F. W.. YEAH IS THAT SOMETHING THAT IS OCCURRING NOW OR THAT IT IT IS KIND AND FLAG DFW IS THE LEAD. THEY ARE VERY MUCH WANTED TO HAVE OUR PARTICIPATION BECAUSE WE HAVE ACCESS TO PRIVATE LANDS TO MAKE SURE. PASSED WE KNOW TO NOT RESPECT GEOGRAPHIC BOUNDARIES AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE A CLOSELY. A COORDINATED EFFORT THAT HAS STARTED SEVERAL MONTHS AGO. AREN'T THEY THEY ARE THE LEAD AGENCY BUT OUR ABILITY TO BE IN PLACES WHERE THEY CAN'T BE FOR SURVEY AND DETECTION WORK WILL FEED DIRECTLY INTO THEM. SO I I DON'T SEE ANY PROBLEMS WITH THAT UNLESS THERE'S SOMETHING SPECIFIC THAT. ACROSS LANCE'S. ACOSTA. IF IT HELPS THIS THING'S BEEN UNFOLDING VERY QUICKLY YOU KNOW AND THAT'S WHY WE PUT IT INTO THE MAY REVISE. ON BUT AS OF YESTERDAY WE'VE HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS AND WE HAVE A MEETING SCHEDULED WITH CDF W.. TO JUST BASICALLY COORDINATE WHERE WE'RE AT AS WE GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS BUT ALSO TO TRY TO IDENTIFY NEXT STEPS ON OUR COLLABORATION OUR COMMUNICATIONS PLAN. AND THEY HAVE AN INCIDENT COMMAND SYSTEM SET UP THAT'S MORE TACTICAL DATA DATA DEAL WITH THE PASSED OUT IN THE FIELD WILL DEFINITELY WE ARE PLUGGED INTO THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE PLUGGED INTO THAT. BUT OUR INTENTION GOING FORWARD IS TO SET UP AN EXECUTIVE STRUCTURE SO THAT THE TWO AGENCIES CAN COMMUNICATE ON A CONSISTENT BASIS GOING FORWARD. SO THAT BOTH OF OUR EFFORTS ARE COORDINATED AND THAT IS TO GET RID OF THIS THING. AND I I WOULD ASK YOU TO. ALSO CONFER WITH STAKEHOLDERS SAID. SO THAT JUROR AND BEING CERTAIN THAT YOU HAVE THEIR INPUT AND TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR CONCERNS MIGHT BE YES WE DO HAVE IS A ROBUST UP PROGRAM AS POSSIBLE. AT AS AS YOU SAY THE. OF THE PAST ISN'T IT.

CAL FIRES FIRE ENGINES WERE STILL ACTIVELY BEING MOVED AROUND THE STATE IN ACTIVE FIRE SUPPRESSION OR MOVING IN COVERING FIRE STATIONS ALL OVER THE STATE. WE WERE NOT ABLE AND DID NOT HAVE THE STAFF TO KEEP THOSE VEHICLES MAINTAINED. AND FOUND OURSELVES SIGNIFICANT BEHIND IN MAINTENANCE AS WE NOW ENTER INTO THE NEW FIRE SEASON SO THE VEHICLE MAINTENANCE AND AND TWENTY FIVE HEAVY EQUIPMENT MECHANICS AS PART OF THAT REQUEST. ARE SIGNIFICANT NOW IN NEED OUGHT TO SUPPORT OUR BILLY TO KEEP UP WITH THE NEW A WORKLOAD. UP THE ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT POSITIONS ARE MOSTLY A CONTINUATION OF OUR CAL CARD SUPPORT POSITIONS THAT WERE FUNDED THROUGH.

REGULAR I ADMINISTRATIVE WORKLOAD IN DOCUMENTS THAT THESE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS ARE CRITICAL WE HAVE ALMOST ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN INVOICE IS BEING PROCESS JUST FROM LAST YEAR. OF THIS IS TO PAY ALMOST A THOUSAND FIRE DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA INCLUDING THE COUNTY OF KERN WHICH JUST HAD TO TAKE OUT A LOAN TO MEET PAYROLL WHILE THEY WAITED FOR CAL FIRE.

WE'VE EXAMINED ALL OF THE WORKLOAD AND CAPACITY OF OUR FIRE AND LIFE SAFETY DIVISION OUT TO MEET OUR MISSION TODAY IN AND OUT ON INTO THE FUTURE. SO AT THIS POINT CAL FIRE OFFICE OF THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL'S REQUESTING APPROVAL OF AN INCREASE. OF OF FOUR MILLION A. TWENTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN REIMBURSEMENT AUTHORITY AND FIFTEEN POSITIONS TO SUPPORT OUR FIRE LIFE SAFETY DIVISIONS INCREASED WORKLOAD. RELATED STE ADD TO ITS PLANNER VIEW.

THANK YOU SEEN NONE LA THOUGH WE HAVE RAISED CONCERNS THANK YOU AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NO COMMENTS. LET'S IT MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT FIREWORKS PROGRAM. IT'S BEEN LONG IN THE. IN THE MAKING. YES IT HAS. WHEN I WAS AYE I WAS FIRST APPOINTED STATE FARM MARSHALL LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO. I REALIZE THAT THIS. HAS BEEN AN ONGOING A LONG TERM I ISSUE. AND. WE'RE ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER A MANY STAKEHOLDERS TO ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES AND SIT DOWN AND. TO. WORK OUT A SOLUTION SO THE PROBLEM OR QUICK. USE AND SALE OF ILLEGAL FIREWORKS TO SKYROCKET IN CALIFORNIA. FUNDING FOR ENFORCEMENT EDUCATION. IN DISPOSAL HAS BEEN INADEQUATE. LACK OF ENFORCEMENT OF. ILLEGAL FIREWORKS HAS TO CONTINUE DISH BEEN A CONTINUE ISSUE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. ARE REQUIRING A MAJOR OVERHAUL OF HOW CAL FIRE OFFICE OF THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL. ADDRESSES AND DISPOSES OF DANGEROUS AND ILLEGAL FIREWORKS. EACH YEAR TO GIVE ME AN IDEA OF THE CAPACITY OR THE VOLUME. THAT WE DEAL WITH EACH YEAR. WE. HAVE TO ADDRESS THE. AT THE SEIZURE OF APPROXIMATELY OR IN EXCESS OF TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS. OF. SEIZED ILLEGAL AND DANGEROUS FIREWORKS STATEWIDE. WITHOUT A STABLE FUNDING SOURCE. FOR DISPOSAL THE CONFISCATION OF ILLEGAL AND DANGEROUS FIREWORKS. HAS CREATED SIGNIFICANT IT. HAZARD TO THE ENVIRONMENT AS WELL AS PUBLIC SAFETY. THE SOLUTION. THAT'S BEING PROPOSED OF FOR THEY A IN A ADDRESSES INCREASED ENFORCEMENT PUBLIC EDUCATION AS WELL AS FUNDING FOR DISPOSAL. DEVELOPED THROUGH A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS COORDINATED BY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE A IN INCLUDED SEVERAL STAKEHOLDERS THE FIREWORKS IN HIS INDUSTRY. CALIFORNIA FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION THE LEAGUE OF CITIES CALIFORNIA POLICE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION. CORRESPONDING A TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. WILL CREATE A NEW RELIABLE FUNDING MODEL INVOLVING A NONPROFIT FIREWORKS STEWARDSHIP ORGANIZATION WHICH WILL PARTNER WITH THE THE OFFICE OF THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL. TO MANAGE SEIZE COMMERCIALLY VIABLE FIREWORKS ILLEGAL FIREWORKS. THIS WORKS BY ALLOWING THE FIREWORKS INDUSTRY TO REPURPOSE COMMERCIALLY VIABLE OF FIREWORKS OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS REDUCES THE VOLUME OF REMAINING SEIZE FIREWORKS TO TO BE DISPOSED OF AS HAZARDOUS WASTE THEREBY RE REDUCING COSTS. FOR THAT DISPOSAL ULTIMATELY. OUR GOAL. WITH THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL IS SAID TO PROVIDE A LONG TERM SUSTAINABLE A FUNDING SOURCE TO SUPPORT THIS. OUR ARMED ARE MANDATORY OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO ILLEGAL FIREWORKS. I REDUCE UP POTENTIAL RISK THE PUBLIC AND THE ENVIRONMENT. REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF ILLEGAL FIREWORKS ENTERING THE STATE. A PROVIDE A STABLE FUNDING SOURCE TO SUPPORT. OUR EFFORTS IN IRAQ TO KEATING ILLEGAL FIREWORKS AND DEALING WITH DISPOSAL. SUPPORTING LOCAL FIRE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARE IN THEIR ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS. AND PROVIDE A ROBUST PUBLIC EDUCATION SAFETY CAMPAIGN. SO WITH THAT SAID CALL FOR OFFICE OF THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL IS REQUESTING APPROVAL OF ONE TIME FINDING A THREE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL LICENSE PLATE OR. YEP PLATE FUND FOR FISCAL YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN ONLY. TWO ONGOING POSITIONS TO OVERSEE THE PROPOSED FIREWORKS STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM INCLUDING. INCREASING THE STATE'S. ABILITY TO REDUCE THE INFLUX OF ILLEGAL FIREWORKS. ONGOING FIREWORKS FUND REIMBURSEMENT AUTHORITY OF TWO POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS DOLLAR STARTING IN FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY. AND LASTLY OUT TO THE ADOPTION OF NECESSARY TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE SHUT TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM. SO WITH THAT I'LL BE HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU. QUESTION JUST BONTA. OF THEM AND MAYBE THE LA OKAY AND CAN ANSWER THIS AND AND IN HER COMMENTS BUT I GUESS MY QUESTION IS IN TERMS OF THE PROP FORTY SIX APPLICATIONS. A VOICE EXCITE BOMB. IN TERMS OF THEM MANAGEMENT CHARGE OR THE FEE OR THE LOBBY Y. COLLEGE THAT TAX IN TERMS OF WENT ON ON FIREWORKS. DOES THIS TRAILER BILL REQUIRE A TWO THIRDS VOTE. AND OUR AIR THEREFORE IF NOT HOW DO HOW THEN DOES THIS CHARGE OR FEE OR TAX GET IMPLEMENT. STEVEN BENSON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO WE ARE CONTINUING TO LOOK INTO THAT OUR INITIAL ASSESSMENT OF THE PACKAGES IS PUT TOGETHER WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION IS THAT E WE BELIEVE THAT IT FITS THE DEFEAT DEFINITION. BUT WE ARE CONTINUING TO HAVE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S KIND OF AN AGREEMENT ON THAT. IF THERE'S PIVOTS NEEDED THEN YOU KNOW WE CERTAINLY TALKED CERTAIN SO JUST TO CLARIFY IF IF IT DOES FIT THE FEE DEFINITION THEN PROP TWENTY SIX DOES REQUIRE A TWO THIRDS VOTE ON THIS WOULD THIS. BUDGET TRAILER WOULD THEN BE A TWO THIRDS VOTE. IF IT DOESN'T FIT A FEE IF IF IT NEEDS TO BE A TAX LIKE A THIRD IF PEOPLE CONCLUDED ATTACKS AND SUPPOSED TO FEEL THAT IT WOULD NEED A TWO THIRDS. ARE ASSESSMENT WAS THAT IT FIT THE BILL OF THE FEE AND DIDN'T NEED A TWO THIRDS BUT WORKS THAT WERE STILL HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHERS. ABOUT THAT MATTER FOCUS OF SO IT'S STILL UNCLEAR. THERE'S STILL SOME CONVERSATIONS GOING ON ADMINISTRATION FELT LIKE IT WAS. WE'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES OBVIOUSLY INVOLVED IN THE GETTING THEIR PROPOSAL PUT TOGETHER SO WE'RE TALKING TO OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY AGREE AND WE GET CONSENSUS AROUND THAT SO THAT IN TERMS OF I IF I COULD ASK THAT. THE ASCAP ARE HOW DOES THIS. REVENUE BUT AS A GUESS AT HOW DOES THIS. CHARGE GET ASSESS. THE THE CONCEPT IS THE THE. THE STEWARDSHIP ENTITY ITSELF WHICH IS SOME MADE UP OF. THE MEMBERS OF THE FIREWORKS AND. INDUSTRY ASSESSES IT ITSELF. A FEE THAT IT DETERMINES IS APPROPRIATE TO TO REIMBURSE OUR COST TO. TO. IN TO CONDUCT FOR ENFORCEMENT PUBLIC EDUCATION AND AND DISPOSAL. SO THE THE REVENUES. FROM THE MANAGEMENT FEE. DO NOT COME TO THE STATE THEY GO TO THE STEWARDSHIP. PROGRAM WHICH THEY ASSESS THEMSELVES. AND AND THEN THAT MONEY THEN WE GET GO TO REIMBURSE THE STATE. CORRECT OR ARE COSTS FOR. FIRED DEALING WITH ILLEGAL FIREWORKS ISSUE. DOES THE FEE SHOW UP IN THE POINT OF PURCHASE TRANSACTION WITH PEOPLE WHO BUY ILLEGAL FIREWORKS. THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF HOW WOULD WORK ISN'T THAT A TAX. I DON'T KNOW OUR INITIAL AS MISTER BENSON MENTION OUR INITIAL ASSESSMENT WAS SET. ASIDE THIS GENTLEMAN IS THE FIRE MARSHAL NOT DEAD LEGAL ANALYST IF EXCEPT I DON'T THINK IT'S QUITE A FAIR QUESTION TO ASK. CLUE MAKE CLUE YET ON THAT AND I'LL JUST REITERATE WHAT MISTER BENSON SAID IS IS THE IN OUR INITIAL ASSESSMENT AS WE SAT DOWN WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS. WAS AT THIS SUMMIT THE TO THE DEFINITION OF A OF A FEE. AND IF IT TURNS OUT THAT THAT'S NOT THE CASE THEN OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD WE WOULD GO THE APPROPRIATE ROUTE TO. ADDRESS IT. I AGAIN I. WASN'T. THAT I THINK PART OF OUR RESPONSIBILITY HERE IS TO FIND OUT PRECISELY WHAT THE TRANSACTION IS. AT THE TRANSACTION IS IMPOSED ON A POINT OF SALE TO CONSUMERS OF LEGAL FIREWORKS IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IS A. SELF EVIDENT TAX. SO I I DID. FORGIVE THE QUESTION IT'S A COMMENT. WITH RESPECT TO GET AYE CURE. CORRECTLY THAT. I FEEL IT. ILLEGAL FIREWORKS IN CALIFORNIA ARE NOT. ALWAYS ILLEGAL IN OTHER STATES. IS THERE A COLLECTION. OF THOSE ILLEGAL CALIFORNIA FIRE WORKS. AND THEN. WHAT? PROVIDED FOR A THE A MARKET FOR THOSE LEGAL FIREWORKS IN SOME OTHER STATE WITH RESPECT I WHAT I HEAR WITH RESPECT TO HOW. LEGAL FIREWORKS OTHER PLACES THAT ARE COLLECTED IN CALIFORNIA ARE MANAGED TO HELP REDUCE THE LOAD. SO AT AT THIS MOMENT UNDER CURRENT LAW. ALL FIREWORKS THAT ARE SEIZED BY. ANYBODY WHETHER IT'S LOCAL FIRE. OR LAW ENFORCEMENT OR OR THE STATE. THAT IS CONSIDERED A HAZARDOUS WASTE AND THEREFORE MUST BE DISPOSED OF. AS SUCH AND SO THAT IS THAT IS THE PROCESS TODAY AND IT IT IS QUITE EXPENSIVE. AND SO WHAT THIS. A PROGRAM ATTEMPTS TO ESTABLISH IS A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE. WITH THE STEWARDSHIP OF ORGANIZATION. THE INDUSTRY TO ALLOW FOR RE PURPOSING OF THAT COMMERCIALLY VIABLE. ILLEGAL FIREWORKS IN CALIFORNIA SO THEY CAN BE REPURPOSED AND OTHER STATES WHERE THEY MAY BE LEGAL. AND THAT THAT THE THE IT DOES NOT THAT LOCK THEM UP AND SENATE OTHER STATES ARE YOU GOING TO DO SOMETHING WITH THAT. PRODUCT IN STATE TO MAKE. SAFE FIREWORKS OR LEGAL FIREWORKS IN CALIFORNIA I'M I'M GONNA KNOW WHAT DEFINED WE PURPOSING REPURPOSE IN WOULD BE THE THE STEWARDSHIP ORGANIZATION WOULD TAKE WHAT IS WHAT WOULD BE LEGALLY. CAPABLE SELLING AND ON THE OTHER STATES A AND DOING THAT SO THEY WOULD TAKE IT OUT OF THE STATE AND SELL IT IN ANOTHER STATE AND THAT HELPS US REDUCE OUR COSTS. TO DISPOSE WHAT'S LEFT. MISTER MULLIN. SO YOU'RE TAKING STUFF THAT'S ILLEGAL IN CALIFORNIA AND ALLOWING IT TO ACROSS STATE LINES AND THEN BE USED ELSEWHERE. ALRIGHT. YES. YEAH. SO. LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT LIBYA PLAN WITH STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO REDUCE THE VOLUME OF ILLEGAL FIREWORKS ENTERING CALIFORNIA CAN GIVE ME A SENSE OF. IS HOW THAT MIGHT BE DONE I MEAN MOST OF THIS ENFORCEMENT STUN. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BUT. HOW CAN YOU GIVE ME? IF YOU EXAMPLES OF HOW WE MIGHT COMBAT THIS PROBLEM OF ILLEGAL FIREWORKS I PERSONALLY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH FIREWORKS SO. I'M JUST TRYING TO. UNDERSTAND. WHAT WE'RE GONNA GET FOR FOR THIS MONEY HERE HOW WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE A REDUCING THE VOLUME OF ILLEGAL FIREWORKS IN THE STATE AND THEN WE'LL WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT CROSS STATE ISSUE? CHAIR OF THE TIME. SO THEIR. ON GOING FOR YEARS. THERE ARE LOCAL REGIONAL. ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS THROUGH LOCAL TASK FORCES. TO TO ADDRESS ILLEGAL FIREWORKS A PROBLEM SO I DON'T IDENTIFY HOW WHAT'S COMING IN. AND ALL THE WAY UP TO SEIZING IT AND AND. DEALING WITH THE INDIVIDUAL SIDE HAVE BROADBAND OR SELLING IT. LA LOT OF THAT ACTIVITY HAS WANED. IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT MY OFFICE NO DOES NOT HAVE THE FUNDING. TO. COLLECT THE CEASEFIRE WORKS AND DEAL AND PROPERLY DISPOSE OF IT. I IN FACT. IN A MEETING I WAS I HAD. WITH SOME OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FIRE. BLOOM INDIVIDUALS. MADE THE COMMENT THAT THEY WERE REDUCING THEIR ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY DID NOT WANT TO BE STUCK WITH THE SEIZED FIREWORKS SO TO ME THAT'S A PROBLEM. AND SO. OUR OUR. THAT THE THE VISION. WITH THIS PROGRAM IS THAT. WE. AT A STATEWIDE LEVEL. FACILITATE. EIGHT. TASK FORCE. THAT INVOLVES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. STATE AGENCIES. AND WE WE WORK TOWARDS SUPPORTING THOSE LOCAL AND REGIONAL EFFORTS AND SO FOR EXAMPLE. THAT CONDUCTING INTERDICTION ACTIVITIES AT THAT STATE LINE. BETWEEN. NEVADA AND CALIFORNIA AS AN EXAMPLE. WORKING IN. PORTS. WITH THOSE THOSE LOCAL ENTITIES. WHICH ARE ALSO ENTRY. MODES. INTO CALIFORNIA SO. THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT VENUES AND AND METHODS THAT THE ILLEGAL FIREWORKS AND HER. DOES LOCAL AGENCIES ARE NO BASS THIRTIES TOO USED TO IT. AND WE WERE LEVERAGE. THAT THE THE THE THE POWER OF OF ALL OF US WORKING TOGETHER AND THE FUNDING THAT COMES WITH THIS PROGRAM. TO ASSIST. IN THOSE EFFORTS. THERE BE A PUBLIC EDUCATIONAL COMPONENT HERE I'M SURE THERE ARE YEARS WITH REGARD TO IMPACT ON PAT'S AND SO FORTH WITH WITH FIREWORKS AND. EDUCATION AROUND HOW TO PROTECT PET STE. THE FOURTH OF JULY THOSE KINDS OF ACTIVITIES. YEAH YEAH I THINK WE CAN DO BETTER BE HONEST WITH YOU. I WAS A LOCAL FIRE MARSHAL FOR MOST OF MY CAREER. AND IN SO I RECOGNIZE THOSE. THOSE ISSUES ARE FROM A LOCAL PERSPECTIVE. THAT I THINK WE. MY VISION. WITH WITH A UTILIZING SOME F THIS FUNDING IS TO CREATE A ROBERT A ROBUST PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN THAT WE CAN. REACH EVERY. INDIVIDUAL IN THE STATE TO ADDRESS ISSUES LIKE HOW TO PROTECT YOUR PETS WHAT'S LEGAL WHAT'S NOT LEGAL IN YOUR COMMUNITY. THANK YOU. LA ODF COMMENTS YES THANK YOU. WE WE AGREE THAT THIS IS A. ADDRESSES A PROGRAMMATIC CHALLENGE HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR SOME TIME. BUT WE DO THINK IT COMING IN THE MAY REVISION. AND CREATING AN ENTIRELY NEW PROGRAM A NEW FUNDING STREAM. MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO WASTE ON THE MERITS OF THIS APPROACH VERSUS OTHERS OBVIOUSLY COMPLICATED AND THERE'S NOT SAYING QUESTIONS ABOUT EXACTLY HOW IT WOULD WORK. AND SO WE THINK THE MY OWN HOUSE THE DEPARTMENT YOU KNOW WHY THEY THINK THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW PROGRAM SHOULD BE DONE IN THE BUDGET PROCESS AND AT THIS. POINT IN THE BUDGET PROCESS. AND ALSO ONE ALTERNATIVE. APPROACHES WERE CONSIDERED AND WHY THIS ONE WAS WAS THE BEST ONE IN THEIR VIEW. THANK YOU ANEMIA ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. FONG I KNOW I'D PARA FINANCE S. ANSWER THE QUESTION BUT DO YOU DOES ELIA HAVE ANALYSIS ON PROP TWENTY SIX. AND THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE ANALYZE SPECIFICALLY WITH REGARDS WITH WITH MAKING BUT CERTAINLY LOOK OUT AND AND INTO THEIR STUFF UP. IS THERE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUES A SIX SEVEN AND EIGHT. OF THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR RUSSELL NO ACT ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION THE FIRE DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN ISSUE THAT WE'VE BEEN. NEGOTIATING AND IN OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH THE THEIR APARTMENT AND THE. FIRE MARSHAL FOR MANY MANY MANY YEARS AND THIS IS A.

ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON ASKING A LONG SERIES OF QUESTIONS THAT THE LAST TIME THAT IT THAT IT CAME UP AND. IT'S OUR OBVIOUSLY BEEN. A STRUGGLE AND IT DIFFICULT COMPLEX ISSUE OF FOR YOU TO COME UP WITH A RESOLUTION AROUND I WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU AND THANK YOU FOR ALL THE WORK IT MUST HAVE TAKEN TO BRING ALL THOSE. STAKEHOLDERS AROUND THE A THE TABLE AND COME UP WITH A RESOLUTION I WANTED I THINK THE STAKEHOLDERS. AS AS WELL FOR THEM FOR THEIR EFFORTS IN THE. GOTTA BRING THIS PROPOSAL FORWARD. THANK YOU A THANK YOU FOR THAT I ALSO WANTED A QUICKLY COMMENT BEFORE WE CLOSE OUT TO. THE DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND AND FOR PROTECTION ITEM A THERE WAS AN ITEM ON THE. VOTE ONLY CALENDAR FUNDING FOR TWELVE HELICOPTERS THAT. ALSO IS AN ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME AS A DIRECTOR PIMLOTT TOES I'VE BEEN. OF PUSHING AND PUSHING AND PUSHING TO. ACCELERATE THE PROGRAM FOR ACQUISITION OF FOR HELICOPTER SO THAT WE COULD REPLACE OUR OUR FLEET NYSSA A COMMITTEE HAS SIR A HAS ASKED FOR THAT I'M. GRATIFIED THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF. A COME TOGETHER AROUND A PROPOSAL THAT NOT ONLY GETS THE PROGRAM STARTED BUT. ENVISIONS. ACQUIRING THOSE DOZEN HELICOPTERS OVERHEAD ITSELF FOR ERA TIME FRAMES THAT RIGHT. SO THAT WILL A COMPLETELY OF REPLACE THE CURRENT VIETNAM. OF VINTAGE HELICOPTERS THAT ARE RUNNING OUT OF SPARE PARTS. AND THEY CAN'T FLY AT NIGHT HAVE OTHER LIMITATIONS AND THE THAT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO. FIGHT FIRES IN THE STATE MISTER PATTERSON ADVOCATE PIGGYBACK ON THAT. THE SOONER THE BETTER WE WE WE GET THAT AIR FLEET. MODERNIZED OBVIOUSLY. I'M. WOULD THESE. BEN AND THE OTHER THING IS THE HELICOPTER YOU CHOSE. IS A SUPERB MACHINE. I'M ARE WITH RESPECT TO. WILL THE WILL THESE ASSETS BE. PRE POSITIONED. IN IN IN NEW OR DIFFERENT WAYS GIVEN THE STUD SORT OF THE NEW REALITY OF OF OUR FIRES WHERE WHERE WILL THEY BE STATIONED AT HOW WILL THEY BE. PRE POSITIONED IT IN AN EFFORT. TO GET UP IN THE AIR QUICKLY AND GET TO THE FIRES. CLOSE PROXIMITY WITH THE AIR POWER. VERY GOOD QUESTION I'M HELLFIRE HAS AN EXISTING TEN. HELLA TECH BASIS SPREAD ACROSS CALIFORNIA NEAR VERY STRATEGIC AND WHERE THEY REPLACED ORIGINALLY BASED ON THAT THE U. H. WHEN HUEY'S. UP YOUR INTENT IS TO PUT THEM IN THOSE LOCATIONS BUT THEY'VE BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE BUT CERTAINLY WITH THIS NEW A PLATFORMER CONTINUE TO REEVALUATE. WE HAVEN'T YOU HAD THIS PLATFORM BEFORE IT WAS IT WAS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY WITH YOU KNOW MAYBE FASTER FLIGHT TIMES IN DIFFERENT CAPACITIES. THAT WERE ABLE TO MAYBE LOOK AT SOME OF THAT BUT IT BUT WE HAVE TEN VERY EFFECTIVE TELETECH BASES WILL BE LOOKING AT UPGRADES TO THOSE. THROUGH THE CAPITAL OUTLAY PROCESS UP BUT WE ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT MOVING FORWARD. WITH IMPLEMENTING ND AS WE SPEAK WE'RE PREPARING THAT TO MAKE THE FIRST REQUIREMENT BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW WE ARE BUDGETED. IN THE CURRENT. YEAR AFTER THAT FIRST PLATFORM AND SO WE'RE VERY EXCITED TO BE MOVING FORWARD AS WE STUDY. THAT SO THAT THERE IS THEY'VE THERE WILL BE OVER TIME A. CONSIDERATION OF PERHAPS REPOSITIONING. A IF THE BUT FOR EXAMPLE IF IF IF URBAN AREAS ARE IN MUCH MORE. SIGNIFICANT. DANGER. WHAT WOULD THERE BE OTHER? MORE URBAN OUR CLOSE PROXIMITY. AT AIRPORTS. TO PLACE THEM I I THOUGHT I HEARD YOU SAY THAT THAT'S A THAT. YOU'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THE POSSIBILITY OF. OF POSITIONING WITH RESPECT TO THE NEW CHALLENGES THAT WE AND THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT THE NEW. PLATFORM PROVIDES IT WHAT WERE ALWAYS EVALUATING NOT JUST WHERE ARE AYE AVIATION ASSETS ARE WERE ALL OF OUR ASSETS ARE AS. WELL. URBANIZATION CHANGES AS FIRE THREATENING MISSION DENSITY CHANGE WERE ALWAYS REEVALUATING. OUT WHERE YOU KNOW OUR LOCATE OUR ASSETS ARE LOCATED WILL CERTAINLY CONSIDER THAT. WITH THE HELICOPTERS AS WELL BUT AS I SAID RIGHT NOW WE'VE GOT TEN VERY EFFECTIVE. HOW ATTACK BASES IN IT WILL CONTINUE TO TO UTILIZE THOSE BUT REEVALUATE BUT AS WE GO FORWARD TO IMPLEMENT THIS NEW HELICOPTER APT AND I BY APPRECIATE? HAVING A CONVERSATION AS YOU MOVE FORWARD ON THOSE KINDS OF THINGS WITH WHICH THEY BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A REAL POTENTIAL THAT YOU CAN YOU CAN HAVE A WHERE THEY PRESENTLY ARE IF IN FACT THERE SPEEDIER QUICKER WITH HIGHER. CAPACITY SO THERE THERE'S A WAY FOR POSITIONING TO BE AS EFFECTIVE AS POSSIBLE BUT I WOULD. BECAUSE OF THE AREAS WE SERVE IN THE DIFFICULTIES THAT TO THAT WE'RE FACING. BRIEFING MAYBE AT AS HOW THOSE NEW. OPERATIONS GO WOULD WOULD BE TERRIFIC AND OUT. I WOULDN'T MIND RIDE ALONG ON ONE OF THEM. SPEAKER I THINK WE'RE ALL LOOKING FOR THAT LEAD BRIDES FACT THAT. THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU. AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO THANK THIS. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK SHARE BLOOM IN THIS COMMITTEE. FOR THE SUPPORT THROUGH THIS ENTIRE PROCESS I. I I THINK I CAN SPEAK FOR THE ENTIRE DEPARTMENT CALVARY THAT DEBT WE ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS AND TO. IT'S VERY PALPABLE THROUGHOUT THE DEPARTMENTS OF THANK YOU. THANK YOU AGAIN A HENTAI WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION. WELCOME HAVE HELICOPTERS COME ONBOARD. THE HELICOPTERS. NO HELICOPTERS BUT SOME VERY IMPORTANT CULTURAL A RESOURCES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. ABSOLUTELY MISTER CHAIRMAN WE SMOG. GOOD MORNING THE FIRST ITEM ON YOUR AGENDA IS. I REQUEST IN THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION FOR TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND. FOR THE RENOVATION OF THE WING OF THE MUSEUM OF TOLERANCE AT THE SIMON WIESENTHAL CENTER. THIS WOULD BE. ABOUT HALF OF THE TOTAL COST OF THE RENOVATION ON THE BALANCE OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS IS EXPECTED TO BE RAISED THROUGH PHILANTHROPIC SUPPORT BY THE MUSEUM. AND. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS ON PROVIDES A STATEWIDE BENEFIT. AS IT CAN AS THE MUSEUM MEAN TO MUSEUM OF TOLERANCE A CONTRIBUTES THE STATE'S DIALOGUE ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND SOCIAL JUSTICE. THANK YOU LA THOUGH. I THINK YOU'RE. WE IS FOR THOSE UNCLEAR Y. THIS PROJECT SPECIFICALLY WAS SELECTED FOR DIRECT GENERAL FUND SUPPORT. TYPICALLY PROJECTS WOULD APPLY FOR LOCAL ASSISTANCE THROUGH SOME OF THE DEPARTMENT'S EXISTING PROGRAMS ARE USUALLY ON A COMPETITIVE BASIS. AND SO. WE THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANNA ASK THE DEPARTMENT WHY AND JUST. PROPOSAL WAS CONSIDERED A HIGHER PRIORITY THAN OTHER PROJECTS ON THE HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR GENERAL FUND RESOURCES. AND. WE ALSO KNOW THAT IF PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT ON THE BALLOT IN JUNE OF THAT. IF SHOULD IT PASS WILL PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR A PARKS AND RECREATION PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND SO WHETHER THIS MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE FOR THAT OR. IF THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDING COULD FREE UP. LOCAL MONIES FOR THE STOCK. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT FINANCE. GOOD MORNING MICHAEL MCGINNIS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION SUPPORTS THIS PROPOSAL. BASED ON THE MERITS THAT WERE OUTLINED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION. PROPOSITION SIXTY IT WAS CONSIDERED AS A FUNDING SOURCE BUT IT WAS DETERMINED THAT BASED OFF THE TYPE. OF THE DIRECT GRANT THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO PROVIDE HERE THAT IT WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATE. THANK YOU WOULD LIKE TO MOVE ON ISSUE NUMBER TEN. TRICIA NUMBER TONS OF CALIFORNIANS IN HERITAGE CENTER. KNOW BEFORE I BEGIN OF WITH ME IS. YOU INDICATED. I AM CRISTINA SNYDER I AM I THE TROUBLE ADVISER FOR THE GOVERNOR. SO IT'S YOUR TURN A CALIFORNIAN HERITAGE CENTER. THE GOVERNORS ARE COSTING ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND. TO HELP ESTABLISH A NEW INDIAN MUSEUM ON IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT'S ANTICIPATED THAT THE ENTIRE BUILT OUT OF THIS MUSEUM IS TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND WILL BE WORKING WITH INTERESTED PARTIES TO SECURE THE BALANCE OF ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. ON THIS IS YOU CAN SEE FROM YOUR AGENDA IS BUILT OFF OF. AN EFFORT THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING FOR YEARS OVER MANY YEARS THERE WAS A TASK FORCE THAT WAS ESTABLISHED THEIR SENATE BILL TWENTY SIXTY THREE AND TWO THOUSAND JAIL. THAT TASK FORCE WAS COMPRISED OF VARIOUS. TRIBAL COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND THEY WERE TASKED WITH LOOKING AROUND THE STATE TO IDENTIFY ANY. A ON LOCATION FOR A NEW MUSEUM THAT WOULD BE WORTHY OF PRESERVATION AND PROTECTING AND CELEBRATING ON OUT OF NATIVE. HERITAGE. THROUGH THAT EFFORT THEY CHOSE A LOCATION IN THE CITY OF LOS SACRAMENTO. IT'S ALONG THE BANKS OF THE SACRAMENTO RIVER IT'S AT THE CONFLUENCE OF THE TWO RIVERS WHICH PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT CULTURAL. IT'S A LOT OF CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE ONTO THE NATIVE PEOPLES. WE ALSO NOTE IN OUR PROPOSAL THAT THIS WOULD REPLACE OUR EXISTING MUSEUM SORRY EXISTING MUSEUM WAS BUILT IN NINETEEN FORTY. IT'S CO LOCATED AT SUTTER'S FOR WHICH. IT. IS IS IS CONSIDERED KIND OF A CULTURALLY INSENSITIVE TO LOCATE IT THERE ALONGSIDE CENTERS FOR. WE HOUSE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF TRIBAL OBJECTS IN OUR COLLECTIONS LOCATED AT MCCLELLAN AIRFORCE BASE IN ONE OF OUR. IN OUR STATEWIDE MUSEUM COLLECTIONS WAREHOUSE. AND MOST OF THEM SET THERE WITHOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ENJOYED BY THE PUBLIC. AND I'M CONNECTING YOUTH WITH THESE ARTIFACTS. THE LOCATION NOW NOT ONLY IS IT ANTIQUATED BUT IT'S VERY SMALL SO WERE ONLY ABLE TO REALLY PUT ON DISPLAY A VERY VERY SMALL PORTION. OF WHAT. IS UNDER THE STATE STEWARDSHIP. THANK YOU ILIO. YEAH AND WE HAVE TWO MAJOR CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL OF THE FIRST OF WHICH IS. IT'S UNCLEAR THAT THE TWO ARE MILLION COST ESTIMATE IS. ACCURATE OF I KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME STUDIES DONE MOVED DIRECTOR REFERENCED. BUT. TWO THOUSAND AND TWO WAS QUITE AWHILE AGO. AND SAYS YOU LIKE OVERLOOKING ANNOUNCED OF HIS LITTLE CONCEPTUAL WE HAVEN'T SEEN A LOT OF DETAILS ABOUT IT. SO THEY'RE NOT THAT TO HER MILLION DOLLAR AMOUNT IS RIGHT AND THEN SECONDLY THAT. BY PROVING THAT THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE OF THAT IS CURRENTLY PROPOSED I WOULD AUTHORIZE ALL OF THE FUNDING AT ONCE. BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM THE NORMAL CAPITAL OUTLAY PROCESS WHERE YOU SEE A PROPOSAL FOR FUNDING AT EACH STAGE DURING THE PROCESS. OF AND SO WE THINK IT REMOVES A CERTAIN LEVEL LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT FOR A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT DOLLAR AMOUNT. SO WE THINK THAT IF YOU DO WANT TO. MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS PROJECT THAT WOULD MAYBE MAKE MORE SENSE TO JUST FIND WHAT'S NEEDED IN THE BUDGET YEAR. FOR SOME OF THE INITIAL PHASES OF THE PROJECT. IF YOU WANT TO CHOOSE A SET ASIDE SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR THE PROJECT. YOUR HOPE OF SOME OF THE FUNDRAISING THAT THEY MENTIONED. A MEAL YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO STILL MOVE OVER IN TO THE SPECIAL FUND. WE JUST THINK. IF YOU MOVE IT OVER YOU SHOULD AUTHORIZES. ALL OF IT ONCE NECESSARILY. SO THEY CAN CONTINUE TO OVERSEE THIS AS IT DEVELOPS. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT FINANCE. UP THE CRYSTALS ON A FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AYE WE'RE IN SUPPORT OF THIS VERY IMPORTANT PROJECT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND FOR CALIFORNIA TRIBES AND WE'D LIKE TO RE ITERATE A FEW NOTES. I'M FIRST A GENERAL FUND FUNDING FOR. FOR THIS PROJECT DEMONSTRATES THE VARIOUS HERE SERIOUS COMMITMENT UP FROM THE STATE. UP FOR THIS VERY IMPORTANT PROJECT THAT WAS FIRST INITIATED IN TWO THOUSAND TWO. SUCH AS SECOND OF THE FUNDING STRATEGY PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION WILL ALLOW PARKS TO. LEVERAGE FUNDS COMMITTED BY THE STATE TO MAXIMIZE THE OF FUNDRAISING NECESSARY FOR PROJECT COMPLETION. I'M AND LASTLY AT THE PROJECT WILL STILL BE SUBJECT TO SEE OVERSIGHT BY THAT THE PUBLIC. THANK YOU AS ERNIE OF PUBLIC COMMENT ON. ANY OF THE. DEPARTMENT OF PARKS RECREATION ISSUES NINE TEN ELEVEN AYE YES MISTER CHAIRMAN VERY BROKE KAMI HALF OF THE I WOULD CALL THE INDEPENDENT WE INDIANS IN PALM SPRINGS. WERE ONE OF A HUNDRED NINE FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES IN THE STATE. THINK THIS IS A REALLY WORTHWHILE PROJECT I REMEMBER WORKING ON THIS BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TWO TIME FLIES WHEN YOU'RE HAVING FUN. SO WE'RE VERY VERY GRATEFUL FROM MOVING THIS PROJECT FORWARD AND HOPE YOU ADOPT THIS. THIS THIS REVISION REQUEST THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I I ASK FOR PUBLIC COMMENT ON ALL THREE ITEMS. WITHOUT HAVING HEARD THE THIRD ITEM YOU COULDN'T STOP MAKES. IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE HERE TO GET PUBLIC COMMENT ON THAT ON THE THIRD ITEM THEN WILL WITHHOLD THAT UNTIL AFTER. IT'S BEEN PRESENTED BUT IF YOU'RE HERE YARDI STANDING ON THE OTHER TUITION CSUS. CAMANCHE MORNING MISTER CHAIR. MEMBERS OF LARRY MYERS ON THE. CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIAN HERITAGE CENTER FOUNDATION. AND I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS SINCE. TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THE TASK FORCES CREATE HOUSE MEMBER THE TASK FORCE. AND THOSE MEMBERS OF THE TASK FORCE OF ALSO SORT OF TRANSITION OF FOUNDATION. AND LET ME JUST JUST EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO THE INDY COMMUNITY WE'VE BEEN WAITING FORTY PLUS YEARS FOR THIS. AS THINK ABOUT FORTY TWO YEARS AGO WHEN TALKS FIRST STARTED DEVELOPING ABOUT DEVELOPING AND INDEED. MUSEUM A WIDOW ONE COLOR MUSEUM WATER QUALITY HERITAGE CENTER WE WANNA BE ALIVE LIVING PLACE THAT IT WILL HAVE OUR FACTS BUT ALSO WILL HAVE MORE THAN THAT IT WILL HAVE DOCUMENTS OF OF A PLACE. FOR HIM HE'S A NON INDIAN IS TO COME AND WE WE SEE THIS AS BEING SEVEN THAT CAN REACH OUT AND. AND CREE RELATIONSHIP FOR THE UC SYSTEM OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF PROVIDENCE PRIVATE MUSEUMS SHARE INFORMATION TO TO BRING EVERYONE ON THE SAME PAGE I THINK THIS WOULD BE. A GREAT BENEFIT ALL THE CITIZENS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SO WITH THAT I URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS PROJECT THANK YOU. JIMMY SON WEEK THAT MORNING MY NAME'S MORNINGSTAR CALLING HIM A MEMBER OF THE I. JAMALI BAND OF PAPER EVER. AND SERVED AS THE TRIBAL HISTORIC PRESERVATION OFFICER FOR FOREVER TRIED FOR FOUR AND A HALF YEARS. I HAVE SPENT COUNTLESS HOURS EDUCATING SCHOOL BOARDS. TEACHERS AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC ABOUT CALIFORNIA TRIBAL NATIONS A HOME AND SO THESE COMMONLY NAME. THESE COMMONLY. NO NAMES SUCH AS FREMONT CIDER AND HOME YOU KNOW GINA PARA SARAH DOT ARE KNOWN I'M TO HAVE ENSLAVED AND. I'M MURDERED CALIFORNIA TRIED TAKING THOUGHT IT IS THE DUTY FOR OUR GENERAL PUBLIC TO KNOW WITH THE NAMES OF OUR OF OUR TRIBES. CHEST AS WELL SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. MORNING MOUNTIE QUIT US WITH THE CANTON A CRUISE COMPANY ON BEHALF OF RAMONA THE VA HOSPITAL COMMUNITY INDIANS AND HAVE A MENTAL PROBLEM UPPER LAKE. ALSO IN STRONG SUPPORT ON ISSUE NUMBER TEN FOR THE REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED. YOU. GOOD MORNING DEBBIE TREADWAY I AM A MEMBER OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS STRONG SUPPORT FOR A HERITAGE CENTER. THANK YOU I I WOULD JUST ADD ONE COMMENT ON ON ON THIS ITEM A WE'RE GOING TO BE HOLDING IT OPEN AND AND COMING BACK TO IT. AT A AT A FUTURE MEETING AND I HOPE IN THE INTERIM. AYE AYE MEANS WILL BE FOUND TO TO PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT BECAUSE THE WAY THE PROPOSAL IS. IS WORDED RIGHT NOW THE MONEY IS FUNDED AND IT. OVERSIGHT TO WILL RESIDE AND ADMINISTRATIVE. AGENCY WITH NO FURTHER REVIEW BY THE LEGISLATURE AND. BUT. I THINK THIS IS OF GREAT INTEREST TO OF ALL CALIFORNIANS THE LEGISLATURE SHORT CERTAINLY WILL HAVE A AN INTEREST IN MAKING SURE THAT THIS. HERITAGE CENTER. WHICH I THINK WE ALL. I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA. BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MAXIMIZE THE OPPORTUNITY AND TO. CONTINUE TO. HAVE A RESPONSIBLE OVERSIGHT TO OVER PROJECT OF THIS MAGNITUDE TALK. I ENCOURAGE. YOU TO WORK ON THAT TO WITH THE BUDGET STAFF. MR MON. THEY MISS CHAIR. BY CONCUR WITH THOSE COMMENTS I CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE PROJECT JUST TO CLARIFY THE LA JOH. YOU SAID THAT THESE ESTIMATES ARE OLD MAKE CLEARLY IS PROJECTS EVERYDAY OF TALK ABOUT TWO THOUSAND AND TWO. BUT YOUR IS YOUR CONCERN THAT THE OVERALL COST MAY EXCEED TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. OR YOU JUST CONCERNED THAT IT'S AN OUTDATED ESTIMATE WE JUST OVER THAT NOW WHAT THE FINAL PRICE TAG. WOULD BE YEAH I THINK MORE OF OUR CONCERN WAS WAS JUST BAD YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S BASED ON SOME SOME REPORTS THAT WERE OLDER AND WE JUST DON'T HAVE A LOT OF DETAILS ON EXACTLY WHAT THIS. PROJECT WOULD LOOK LIKE. YOU TYPICALLY WE WOULD SEE PROJECTS AND PHASES THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS IS THE COMEBACK WITH THE DESIGN PHASES EMPLOYMENT OF XTERRA. BECAUSE THIS IS STILL KIND OF THE OUTFIT WE JUST. DON'T HAVE THAT AND SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT UNCLEAR IF TO UNDER MILLION IS IS THE RIGHT. AMOUNT. YEAH. RIGHT BRAIN DO ANYTHING THAT WE HAVE A QUESTION AS STATE PARK SELECTED RESPONDED THAT. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WE DID A. FAIRLY COMPREHENSIVE STUDY INCLUDES A DETAILED ESTIMATES. FLOOR PLANS AND AREAS AND SET SUCH FOR THAT FOR THE BUILDING SO. WHEN WE SAY THIS IS CONCEPTUAL. THE IDEA IS IS WE HAVE SOME COMMUNITY OUT OF REACH TO FINE TUNE THE SCOPE BUT THE MAN TO THE PROJECT IS DONE. THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE THE THE OPPOSITION THE CONFIGURATION OF THE BUILDINGS THE PROGRAM AREAS BETWEEN THE BUILDINGS MAY SHIFT SLIGHTLY. BUT THE THE CONCEPT. REMAINS. VERY VERY FIRM IN AND VERY DETAILED. AS FAR AS THE COST THE COST REDUNDANT TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. WE BASICALLY THOSE TO TODAY'S DOLLARS AND THEN PROJECT IS ABOUT TO START CONSTRUCTION FIVE YEARS FROM NOW SO WE'RE WE'RE VERY CONFIDENT THAT THE. AMOUNT OF FIVE FUNDING IS SUFFICIENT TO ACCOMPLISH THE SCOPE THAT'S A CONTAINED IN THIS IN THIS IN THIS DOCUMENT. SO WE DO WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH AND TRAVEL COUPLE GROUPS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FINAL PLAN REFLECTS OUR STATEWIDE VISION AND. AND A PRIORITIES. SO WE DON'T HAVE A A FIXED IDEA OF EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE GONNA BUILD BUT IT'S VERY SOLID AND WE LOOK FOR THE WORKING FOLKS TO FINE TUNE A FURTHER. I'VE. I'VE MISSED PATTERSON NOT IT GO AHEAD AND THAT ALL. I JUST MAKE MY POINT. NOTWITHSTANDING THE CONCERNS RAISED IN THE AND THE CHAIRS CONCERNS. CERTAINLY THERE IS A PATHWAY HERE TO GET THIS PUT TOGETHER SO THAT IT COMES BACK TO US PRETTY SOON WE CAN WE CAN APPROVE IT I WANT TO I WANT TO VOTE FOR THIS. SO WHAT WHAT OF THAT. WHAT KINDS OF ASSURANCES DOES ALEJO NEED IN ORDER? AT AND THE CHAIR NEED. IN ORDER TO GET PAST THAT DEAD. THE P. APPARENT. UNCERTAINTIES. FIVE QUESTION YEAH I THINK EARLIER YES WE'RE JUST CONCERNED. THE OUT WITH WITH THE LACK OF OVERSIGHT IF WE AUTHORIZE ALL THIS AT ONCE SO. YOU KNOW OUR RECOMMENDATION WAS CONSIDERED JUST AUTHORIZING WITH NEEDED IN THE BUDGET YEAR OUGHT TO KEEP IT MOVING FORWARD AND THEN. HAVE THEM COME BACK NEXT. IN THE SAME WAY THAT HE WOULD FOUR FOR A TYPICAL CAPITAL OUTLAY POSTION. PROCESS FOR IT BENEFIT AND ARE YOU ARE YOU SAYING THAT. THE MONEY UP FRONT. YOU'RE WELL PREPARED TO TAKE IT AND GET IT OUT AND CONSTRUCTIVE QUICKLY. IT'S I DON'T WHAT WHAT WOULD PARTIALLY IT OUT SLOW YOU DOWN. SO ASSEMBLY MEMBER MISTER CHAIR I THINK. WHAT WHAT I HEAR IS THAT THERE'S COLLECTIVE IN SPIRIT SUPPORT FOR THIS PROJECT IT WAS NEVER OUR INTENT IN CRAFTING IN THIS MANNER TO SOMEHOW ON DIMINISH OUR LESSONS LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT? SO I THINK IF YOU GIVE US A CHANCE TO GO BACK SPEND A LITTLE MORE TIME WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT'S NOT UNPRECEDENTED IN THE STATE THAT WE WOULD APPROPRIATE ALL OF THE FUNDING UP FRONT I'M WITH GENERAL FUND THERE ARE OTHER EXAMPLES OF WHERE REACHED ON THE ON THE STATE. AND SO WE CAN KIND OF GO BACK THERE AND LOOK AT SPECIFICALLY HOW WE DID THAT BUT I THINK WE'LL HAVE SOME CONVERSATIONS BEFORE THE NEXT HEARING. RON YOU OPEN THE TRUST FACTOR CAN GO WAY WAY UP HERE AND THAT WE CAN MOVE ON TO GET THIS TO. GET THIS DONE I WOULD LIKE TO VOTE ON THIS. WHO? AND I. I'M NOT IT'S TROUBLED BY THE ALLOCATION OF THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WHICH I. DO UNDERSTAND FOR US. A PROJECT OF THIS NATURE WILL UP. HELP LEVERED SHUT. OF CHARITABLE DONATIONS THAT WILL. HELP FILL OUT THE REMAINDER OF THE BUDGET I DO WANT TO POINT OUT AND I'M SURE THIS IS. UNDERSTOOD BUT IT. WERE RELYING ON. A TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WORK THAT WAS DONE ON THE ON THE PROPOSAL AND BEFORE THAT TWO THOUSAND TWO. I HAD TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IS ALL IS A DECADE AGO OF THE TECHNOLOGY THAT IS UTILIZED AND. FACILITIES LIST NATURE HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY EVEN IN THE LAST DECADE AND I HOPE THAT. WE ARE LOOKING AT A FACILITY AT EIGHT HERITAGE CENTER THAT WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL OF THE GREAT TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE OUT THERE. OUT UTILIZED AND. MUSEUMS AND OTHER CULTURAL HERITAGE. OF. SITES. THAT THAT ARE THAT ARE SIMILAR SO THAT WE ARE. WITH THIS KIND OF MONEY. ULTIMATELY BUILDING OUT A WORLD CLASS. A HERITAGE CENTER THAT WILL BE. LOOK TO AROUND THE WORLD AT SAID. AT BEST. THE INTENT IS THAT WITH THIS PROJECT. ON END WITH PARDONING WITH THE TRIBAL COMMUNITY IT'S NOT JUST FROM THE PHILANTHROPIC SUPPORT ASPECT BUT ALSO THAT WILL BE PARTNERING WITH THE TRIBAL COMMUNITIES IN DESIGNING THE INTERPRETIVE PROGRAMS. AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IT'S REALLY ALLOWING US TO HAVE A CALIFORNIA MUSEUM THAT ALLOWS THE NATIVE. STORIES TO BE TOLD A NATIVE VOICES SO THAT'S GOING TO BE ABSOLUTELY KEY. I AM GLAD THAT YOU BROUGHT UP THE NOTION OF TECHNOLOGY THE WAY PEOPLE AND VISITORS WANT TO INTERACT AND MUSEUMS. ON TODAY IS VASTLY DIFFERENT THAN KIND OF THE STATIC EXPERIENCES THAT WE GREW UP WITH AS KIDS SO OUR INTENT WITH THIS PROJECT IS THAT YOU WILL SEE MORE OF AN INFUSION. OF TECHNOLOGY WE WILL BE LOOKING VERY CLOSELY AND HAVE BEEN AT THE SMITHSONIAN. MUSEUM AT NATIVE AMERICAN HISTORY WE WILL ALSO BE LOOKING AT OTHER. OTHER MUSEUMS OF THAT STATURE AND GETTING A SENSE AND LEARNING ABOUT WITH LEARNING FROM THEM ABOUT WHAT'S WHAT'S WORKED AND. AND WHAT HASN'T WORKED AS WE WORK WITH THE TRIBAL COMMUNITY. WHEN QUICKLY FOUGHT THE DEFENSE DO IT DID I UNDERSTAND THAT IS GOING TO BE ON A RIPPED THE RIVER FRONTAGE WILL IT BE A OF RIVER FRONTAGE. I'LL AT THE CONFLUENCE OF THE AMERICAN IN THE SACK CRACKED. THAT THAT THE WONDERFUL SITE. THANK YOU AND DOES NOT BEEN BACKED UP FOR A QUICK SECOND ON THE MUSEUM OF TOLERANCE A PROPOSAL. I I I I KNOW THE FOLKS THERE WITH MUSEUM IS IN MY DISTRICT I VISITED IT MANY TIMES. AND I KNOW THE INTENTION THERE IS TO INCORPORATE INTO A TOP RATE TECHNOLOGY ALSO. SO THAT THE MISSION OF THAT FACILITY CAN BE ACHIEVED AT ITS HIGHEST LEVEL. AND. LET'S TAKE ISSUE NUMBER ELEVEN ON THE FOR. ROSS CULTURAL TREND. IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN TO THE FORT ROSS STATE HISTORIC PARK IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT INTERPRETS. A TWENTY YEAR PERIOD IN WHICH. THAT THE RUSSIAN MERCANTILE PERIOD WHERE THERE IS A PARTNERSHIP WITH I'M VARIOUS NATIVE PEOPLES ALONG WITH THE RUSSIANS THAT RESIDED THERE FOR TWENTY YEARS. WHAT YOU DON'T SEE AS ANY FOR? PHYS PHYSICAL MANIFESTATION AND INTERPRETATION OF THE THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE NATIVE PEOPLES ON DURING THAT TIME AND AND ALSO PRE DATING. THE ARRIVAL OF THOSE GROUPS AND SO WHAT THIS WOULD DO WOULD ESTABLISH A CULTURAL TRAIL IT'S ROUGHLY THREE MILES LONG IT ALSO WOULD COMPLETE A SEGMENT OF CALIFORNIA'S COASTAL TRAIL. IT WILL BE DONE THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE TRIBAL COMMUNITY. IN THAT AREA PRIMARILY THE TEST SCIENTISTS WHO HAVE ALREADY TAKEN A SIGNIFICANT INTEREST AND WORKED VERY HARD AND HELPING TO COLLABORATE WITH US AND ALREADY DEVELOPED AN INTERPRETIVE PROGRAM. AND ALSO WE WOULD PARTNER WITH A PROFESSOR AT UC BERKELEY PROFESSOR CAN'T MIGHT FIT. WHO HAS BEEN? HAS HAD DECADES OF PARTNERSHIP AND INTEREST IN THAT PARTICULAR. IN THAT PARTICULAR PARK. SPEAKING OF TECHNOLOGY THE INTENT IS THAT THIS WOULD NOT JUST BE A TRAIL TO WALK BUT THAT THERE WOULD BE. INTERPRETIVE NOTES SO AS YOU GO INTO THE VISITOR CENTER PERHAPS YOU CAN DOWNLOAD A PODCAST THAT AS YOU AND WALK ALONG THE TRAIL THAT THERE WILL BE EASY THESE INTERPRETIVE STATIONS. AND YOU MAY HEAR. A SONG IN THE NATIVE PEOPLES SUNG BY A TRIBAL ELDER ON YOU MAY HEAR SOMEONE ON FROM THE ALASKA NATIVE GROUPS WHO UP PARTICIPATED VERY HEAVILY DURING THAT THAT THIS HISTORIC TIME. ON AND MAYBE ONE OF THEM TELLING THEIR STORY SO IT'S GOING TO BE A PLATFORM FOR NOT JUST A NORMAL AT A TYPICAL STATE PARKS TRAIL. BUT REALLY KIND OF INFUSING MODERN TECHNOLOGY AND BEING. MARCELLA PRETORIA OF NATIVE PEOPLES. FANTASTIC BELIAU AYE WE HAVE AT RISK. THANK YOU AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I WENT PART OF THIS PART. EXCELLENT A. IS THERE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. THERE IS. I GET FOR BEING PATIENT. NO WORRIES HI MY NAME IS HOLLY MARTINEZ WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS FOUNDATION OUR FOUNDATION IS A WORKS ON BEHALF OF.

OPPORTUNITIES TO REALLY ENGAGE CALIFORNIA'S TO UNDERSTANDING THE HISTORY OF OUR STATE THE HISTORY OF THE STATE PARKS IS SOMETHING WE ARE VERY EXCITED TO SEE AT WANT TO SHOW OUR SUPPORT AND SO THINK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I AM VERY A QUICKLY MENTIONED TO HER THE A COASTAL TRAIL AND TO PERHAPS SOMETIME IN THE. NEXT BUDGET CYCLE A IT WOULD BE.

CONCLUDES ITEM APPRECIATE YOUR COMING HERE TODAY. AND. WE'LL HEAR NOW FROM DEPARTMENT OF RESOURCES RECYCLING IN RECOVERY. CALVET GOLD. GOOD MORNING. MORNING. GOOD MORNING. SCOTT SMITH KLINE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF RESOURCES RECYCLING RECOVERY WE HAVE THREE ITEMS ON YOUR AGENDA TODAY. I DO HAVE BRIEFED BY NOTES ON EACH ONE OF MOVE THROUGH THEM EXPEDITIOUSLY IN ORDER THAT WORKS. YES. THE FIRST ITEM. IS. DISASTER RECOVERY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM CONSISTENT WITH. STATE OF CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY PLAN IN PREVIOUS ASSISTANCE THE DEPARTMENT OF RESOURCES RECYCLING RECOVERY REQUESTS. SIX PERMANENT FULL TIME POSITIONS AND AUTHORITY TO CONTRACT WITH THE SUPPORT CONSULTANT. AND ONE POINT TWO FIVE MILLION FROM THE INTEGRATED WASTE MANAGEMENT ACCOUNT TO. EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND GUIDANCE WHEN DEVELOPING DISASTER RECOVERY PLANS. AND FORMALLY ESTABLISHED A TEAM. STAFF AND A SUPPORT CONSULTANT TO MOBILIZE AND SUPPORT COVER CYCLES RESPOND TO EMERGENCY DECLARATION MISSED MISSION TASKING. FOR STATE OPERATED DISASTER DEBRIS REMOVAL PROGRAMS. CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCES A WIDE ARRAY OF DISASTERS THAT CREATES SIGNIFICANT QUANTITIES OF DEBRIS THAT MUST BE REMOVED PROPERLY RECYCLED OR DISPOSED OF AS EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE. THE POTENTIAL FOR WIDESPREAD TOXIC EXPOSURES AND LASTING THREATS TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY ENVIRONMENT IS POSED BY DEBRIS LEFT IN THE AFTERMATH OF MAJOR DISASTERS. TO BE MANAGEMENT IS COMPLICATED AND IT'S CHALLENGING FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND STATE AGENCIES RD AFFECTED BY A DISASTER BECAUSE OF THE NEED FOR ADEQUATE AVAILABLE AND TIMELY RESOURCES AND PERSONNEL WHO CAN CONDUCT CRITICAL ACTIVITIES. IN RESPONSE TO A GOVERNOR'S DECLARED STATE OF EMERGENCY AND ASSISTANCE REQUEST FROM A LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. AS REGULARLY TASKED COVER CYCLE TO SUPPORT LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN THE MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION. DEBRIS MOVE REMOVAL OPERATIONS. THE RECENT INCREASE. AT THE RECENT INCREASE IN FREQUENCY. CHIU MET THE SAME THING IS THAT THE RECENT FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA RESULTED IN CAL RECYCLE BEING TASKED YEAR OVER YEAR SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. STILL DO DELIVERED TO BELIEVE A DEBRIS REMOVAL OPERATIONS IN THE FIELD. THE RESULTANT REDIRECTION OF STAFF HAS HINDERED OUR ABILITY TO PERFORM SOME OF OUR STATUTORY MANDATED OBLIGATIONS. WE HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE TO HAVE A NUMBER OF APPROPRIATELY QUALIFIED AND TRAINED INDIVIDUALS ACCOUNT RECYCLED WEAPON WILLING AND ABLE TO REPEATEDLY STAFF THE NECESSARY FIELD OPERATIONS BUT THIS IS NOT SUSTAINABLE IS AN APPROPRIATE TEAM TO ENSURE THAT WHEN TASK WE CAN CONTINUE TO CONSISTENTLY DELIVER SAFE. AND EFFECTIVE DEBRIS REMOVAL OPERATIONS AS WELL AS ASSIST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THEIR INDIVIDUAL. EMERGENCY PREPARATIONS. EDU. ALEJO. THINK YOU ACTUALLY AS OF ANALYST'S OFFICE I'M. WE RECEIVE THIS PROPOSAL RECENTLY WERE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING AND NOW I'M IN WILL BE UPDATING THE COMMITTEE HAS WERE ABLE TO DO GOT. BUT SOME OF THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT ARE WHAT THE IMPACT OF THE STOCK. I WILL HAVE ON THEIR ABILITY DO DEBRIS REMOVAL CLEAN UP SPECIFICALLY. MAYBE WHAT SOME OF THE RECENT FIRES WHAT DIFFERENCE IT MIGHT HAVE MADE A WHAT THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE WITH HIS ADDITIONAL STAFF. PRESUMABLY STILL NEED TO BRING IN THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS TO FAST. AND. WHAT KIND OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BE PROVIDED TO LOCAL SPECIFICALLY? THANK YOU GOD DEPARTMENT FINANCE. THANK YOU JULIETTE MARS HYMIE WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE SUPPORT THIS THIS PROPOSAL IT ALSO AS IT. TIES INTO THE OVERALL STATEWIDE EFFORTS ON EMERGENCY RESPONSE. AND. NOTABLY LAST YEAR WE HAD SO MANY OF THE FIRES THAT WE KNEW THAT REQUIRED AND A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF DEBRIS REMOVAL. ACTIVITY. AND. AFTER WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ACTUALLY IT COULD RESULT IN SOME COST AVOIDANCE IS. IF WE HAD SOME OF. LIKE A STRIKE TEAM BASICALLY. TO BE OUR SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS. TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THINGS GO A LITTLE BIT SMOOTHER DOWN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. WHEN THEY'RE NOT RESPONDING TO THE DEBRIS REMOVAL EFFORTS THEY COULD WORK WITH THE LOCALS IN DEVELOPING. PLANS. AHEAD OF A DISASTER. TO MAKE IT GO THAT MUCH SMOOTHER IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU BOB AND I JUST. I FELT INTRODUCE. NEXT ME I IT THIS MORNING IS KENDRA'S A CHEAP DIPPY DIRECTOR FELLERS LIKE. TO SEE. AND I WITH RESPECT TO THE LA DOES. A COMMENTS MEDIA ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED. HALL JUST TO ASK THAT. OF THE DEPARTMENT MAKE SURE THAT YOUR CONFERRING CHO ON THOSE ISSUES WITH BUDGET STAFF. OF WITH A VIEW TOWARD SILVA A SING AT THAT CAN BE RESOLVED BE HAPPY TO DO SO SALUTE THANK YOU. NEXT UP IS SAID THE PLASTIC MARKET DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. THE DEPARTMENT OF RESOURCES RECYCLING RECOVERY REQUESTS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO REAUTHORIZE THE PLASTIC MARK DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM UNTIL JUNE THIRTIETH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO. WE REQUEST FIFTEEN MILLION FROM BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING FUND FOR FISCAL YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND TEN MILLION PCR ANNUALLY FOR NINETEEN TWENTY.

THE A AB TWENTY TWENTY ESTABLISHED THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM IT HAS SUCCESSFULLY INCREASED THE RECYCLING RATE A BEVERAGE CONTAINERS TO OVER SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT. SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM DATA HAS SHOWN THAT THE COMBINATION OF CONSUMER RECYCLING INCENTIVES AND CONVENIENT RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE RESULTS IN BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING A BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING. IN ADDITION FROM TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TO TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE PLASTIC MARKET DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. PROVIDER PAYMENTS TO PLASTIC PROCLAIMERS AND THOSE ARE THE INDIVIDUALS WHO. ARE RECEIVE THE COLLECTED BEVERAGE CONTAINERS AND CLEAN AND WASH INFLATE THEM. AND MANUFACTURES IN AN EFFORT TO DEVELOP CALIFORNIA'S MARKETS FOR RECYCLED EMPTY PLASTIC BEVERAGE CONTAINERS. THE PLASTIC MARK DEVELOPMENT PAYMENTS FACILITATED THE CLEANING OF TRANSFORMATION A PLASTIC FOR REUSE AND REPURPOSE REMANUFACTURING IN CALIFORNIA. CLOSING THE LOOP UNCOLLECTED RECYCLED MATERIALS IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE TO CALIFORNIA. MANY OF ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTAL BETH BENEFITS WE DERIVE. FROM RECYCLING ACCRUE ONLY ONCE WE REDIRECT THE COLLECTED MATERIAL BACK INTO THE STREAM OF COMMERCE. IN RECENT MONTHS THE INTERNATIONAL COMMODITY MARKETS FOR RECYCLING MATERIALS HAVE BEEN DISRUPTED SO SEVERELY THAT CALIFORNIA HAS LOST ITS ABILITY TO MOVE MANY RECYCLED MATERIALS. OUT OF THE STATE. WE ARE EXPERIENCING A BACKUP OF SEVERAL TYPES MATERIALS. ON THE MAGNITUDE. OF THIS BACK UP IS UNPRECEDENTED. THIS IS LARGELY DUE TO IMPORT RESTRICTIONS. PUT ON A INTERNATIONAL TRADE BY CHINA IN THIS POLICY IS KNOWN AS NATIONAL SOARED. AND THE SEVERITY AND THE ULTIMATE LONGEVITY OF THIS POLICY IS UNKNOWN. SO WHAT WE A STRUGGLE TO ADDRESS THIS PARTICULAR BACKLOG A BILL MATERIALS ACROSS THE STREET. ONE MATERIAL PARTICULAR HAS NOT BEEN A PROBLEM THAT IS PLASTIC BEVERAGE CONTAINERS. THIS IS DUE IN LARGE PART TO THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA HAS INVESTED IN THE PLASTIC RECLAIMING AND MANUFACTURING INFRASTRUCTURE VIA THE PM DEBT PAYMENTS. CALIFORNIA HAS LOST SIGNIFICANT PROCESSING CAPACITY OVER RECENT YEARS. IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE PROTECT OUR CURRENT INFRASTRUCTURE TO MANAGE THESE MATERIALS WE GENERATE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THIS PROPOSAL HELPED ENSURE WE DO NOT TAKE A STEP BACKWARDS. THANK YOU. LTO. AYE YES THANK YOU. AT THE TIME OF THE ANALYSIS WE HADN'T SEEN. AYE THE CITY OF US OUT OF THE ADMINISTRATION INDICATED THEY DO. HAVE SOME OF THE BACK OF INFORMATION THAT WE EN ELSEWHERE AND SO WILL ANALYZE THAT AND GET BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ON THE. THANK YOU OUT POINT OUT ON BOTH THIS ISSUE AND THE UPCOMING ISSUE THE. TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT'S PROPOSED HAS WHO WAS NOT AVAILABLE AT THE TIME THE AGENDA WAS PUBLISHED BUT HAS BEEN RECEIVED SUBSEQUENTLY I DON'T THINK IT'S BEEN FULLY ANALYZED BY. ANYBODY AT THIS POINT BUT WERE HOLDING THE ITEM OPENS WILL HAVE TIME TO DO THAT. UNDERSTOOD. SMOKERS MAKE THE SAME COMMITMENT COMMUNICATORS. THANK YOU ISSUE FIFTEEN. COVER CYCLE REQUESTS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO ENABLE FURTHER ENFORCEMENT ON ILLEGAL REDEMPTION OF IMPORTED CONTAINERS BY PROVIDING SPECIFIC AUTHORITY TO THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL TO ENFORCE BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM PROVISIONS. THE PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE SPECIFIES THAT NO REFUND VALUE OR OTHER RECYCLING PAYMENT SHALL BE MADE TO ANY PERSON FOR IMPORTED OUT OF STATE BEVERAGE CONTAINERS. THAT ANY PERSON PARTICIPATING AND CONDUCT INTENDED TO DEFRAUD THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM SHALL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. COVER CYCLE HAS EXISTING ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE ILLEGAL IMPORTATION AND REDEMPTION OF USED BEVERAGE CONTAINERS AND COORDINATE WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE AT BORDER STATIONS. TO INTERDICT ILLEGAL LOADS OF CONTAINERS. CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL OFFICERS ARE OFTEN PRESENT AT BORDER STATIONS IN A PROVIDED WITH THE AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM COULD ASSIST IN ARRESTING INDIVIDUALS ILLEGALLY TRANSPORTING. EMPTY CONTAINERS ADDITIONALLY IF TRANSPORTERS ATTEMPT TO BYPASS THE BORDER STATION BY USING ALTERNATIVE ROUTES MONITORED MONITORED BY HIGHWAY PATROL OFFICERS. THE HIGHWAY PATROL COULD STILL CONDUCT AN INSPECTION AND ARREST. THIS PROPOSAL ADDS. FORMALLY ADDS THE HIGHWAY PATROL TO THE TEAM OF AGENCIES AND FORCING BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM. AND WILL FURTHER OUR EFFORT TO LIMIT FRAUD AGAINST THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU ILIO AT SIMILAR TO THE LAST COMMENT YES WORKING. TO ANALYZE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT WOULD SITTA DITTO RIGHT. ABOUT HIM AND. A DEPARTMENT FINANCE IN THE COMMENTS. THANK YOU MISTER PATTERSON. DOES THIS PROPOSED TO GIVE. BROADER. HIGHWAY PATROL AUTHORITY FOR. ANY KIND OF. AND. BEVERAGE CONTAINER. THE LEGALITY. OR IS IT JUST NARROWED TO THE. FRAUDULENT. YEAH IMPORTATION TO THIS. STATES THE NARROWER OF THE TWO IT IS AND THAT WILL BE SIX. S. THAT IS SPECIFIED IN THE LANGUAGE I BELIEVE IT IS YES OKAY THANK. DIRECTOR OF SMITH LINE YOU POINT OUT THAT. OUR. A RECYCLING IS A SIGNIFICANTLY DIMINISHED. MY UNDERSTANDING IS. OUR RATES ARE DOWN AT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT THE GOAL IS EIGHTY PERCENT I THINK IT'S BEEN A FIVE PERCENT REDUCTION OVER THE. A PAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND IT TO A. AT IT. IN ADDITION TO. THE. A SITUATION WITH CHINA. A MAJOR CAUSE OF THAT THE REDUCTIONS THE CLOSURE OF EIGHT HUNDRED. RECYCLING LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. GIVEN THE A. S. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE LOSS OF RECYCLING I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT I APPRECIATE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PUTTING FORWARD SOMETHING IN AN ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM AND. AT AT AS YOU KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO REINSTATE THE PLASTIC MARKET DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM IS SOMETHING THAT THIS SUBCOMMITTEE INCLUDED IN OUR BUDGET RECOMMENDATIONS. FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS SO GRATIFIED THAT IT'S FINALLY GETTING IN BUT THAT THAT SAID TO A DOES THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE A. POSITION ON THE OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE BOTTLE BILL FIX THAT WERE PART OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATIONS LAST YEAR AND. HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED INTO SENATOR GLAZERS SP FOUR TWENTY FIVE. MOBILE WE I DON'T HAVE. I'M NOT PREPARED JUST WE'RE NOT PICTURED OPINION ON ON ANY PIECE OF LEGISLATION AS WE SPEAK BUT WE CERTAINLY. CONTINUE TO. MONITOR THE OTHER ITEMS THAT YOU REYES PARTICULARLY THAT LOSS OF. RECYCLING CENTERS IS OF IMPORTANCE TO US ONE OF THE. ISSUES THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO ANALYZE A IS WHAT EXACTLY IS THE CAUSE OF THE REDUCTION AND RECYCLING. THERE ARE MANY FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THAT THAT ARE REDUCED RATE THAT REDEMPTION RATE. ON ONE OF THEM IS. SIMPLY THE AMOUNT OF BEVERAGE CONTAINER SALES. AS THAT IS A RATE OF REDEMPTION OVER SALES AND WE'VE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE BEVERAGE CONTAINER SALES AND SO THAT IF WE DON'T HAVE A. CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN REDEMPTION THAT. LOWERS THE RECYCLING RATE IN THE. IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WE'VE ALSO INCREASED ARE EFFORTS ON AND ON FRAUD ENFORCEMENT. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE HAVE REDUCED. THE OPPORTUNITY FOR. ILLEGAL REDEMPTION ABOUT OF STATE BEVERAGE CANNOT CONTAINERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WOULD ALSO DRIVE DOWN THE REDEMPTION RATE BUT THERE'S NO QUESTION WE ALSO HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT FINDING THAT PROPER LEVEL OF CONVENIENCE. RIGHT NOW WE'RE VERY FOCUSED ON IMPLEMENTING AS BEFORE FIFTY EIGHT. AND AND MAKING SURE THAT. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN DEVELOP ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF PROVIDING REDEMPTION OPPORTUNITIES. FOR CONSUMERS IN THE STATE THAT WE THAT WE IMPLEMENT THAT PROPERLY WELL. THANK YOU FOR. REALLY ACT A IN A VERY CONCISE WAY. TALKING ABOUT THE. I VARIOUS COMPLEXITIES OF THIS ISSUE IT'S NOT SIMPLE I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE CAUSES IN MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT INVOLVED IN THE. DROP IN OUR RECYCLING RATES BUT IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR US TO. TACKLE. AND I AND WE REALLY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE DO SO OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IT'S TIME THAT WE HAVE. A MAKE THAT HAPPEN. SO. APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU TOWARDS THAT. THAT AND IS THERE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON. A COVER CYCLE SO THREE ITEMS THIRTEEN FOURTEEN AFFECTING. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MARK MURRAY WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP CALIFORNIA'S GETS WASTE. ITEMS I SPEAKING I THINK TO ISSUE FOURTEEN. AND THAT THE CHAIRMAN HAS ARTICULATED THE PROBLEM THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE WITH REGARD TO. THE CLOSURE OF RECYCLING CENTERS THE DROP IN RECYCLING RATES. THERE MAY BE MANY FACTORS BUT I THINK IT'S IT'S FAIRLY TRANSPARENTLY OBVIOUS WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHEN THE CLOSURES OCCURRED. AND WHEN THE DROP IN RECYCLING RATE OCCURRED IT CORRESPONDS WITH A TWENTY PERCENT REDUCTION IN THE THE PAYMENTS THE GO TO RECYCLERS. AND I THINK THERE IS. GENERAL RECOGNITION THAT THE FORMULA FOR CALCULATING RECYCLING COSTS THE SURVEY METHODOLOGY. IS IS BASICALLY A SURVEY OF EXPENDITURES AND WHEN THE WORLD OF RECYCLING IS IN A BAD PLACE RECYCLERS DON'T SPEND AS MUCH MONEY. AND THAT IS THEN REFLECTED IN A LOWER SURVEYED COSTA RECYCLING LOWER PAYMENTS PER CYCLE RECYCLERS WEEKS KIND OF SEEN THIS DEATH SPIRAL OCCUR OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS AND AND IN TOTAL. THAT DEATH SPIRAL HAS COST THE RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA MORE THAN THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. AND YOU KNOW I I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT THIS MAY BE COMPLICATED BUT WHAT WE'RE UP WERE SEEN THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED THIS YEAR. WE'VE SEEN THE COSTA. FOR PT BOTTLES STILL REMAINS TWENTY PERCENT BELOW THE THE COST BASIS THAT WAS IN PLACE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN BEFORE ALL THIS DROPPED OCCURRED. THE PROCESSING PAYMENT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST RECYCLING AND SCRAP VALUE BUT THE SCRAP VALUE THAT'S BEING USED. THIS IS NOTHING THE APARTMENTS DOING WRONG THEY'RE JUST FOLLOWING THE STATUTE IT'S THE STATUTE THAT NEEDS TO BE UPDATED. THE SCRAP VALUE THAT THEY'RE USING FOR THE PROCESSING PAYMENT. IS. NOT THE ACTUAL SCRAP VALUE THAT THE RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE IS RECEIVING THE ACTUAL RECYCLING THE ACTUAL SCRAP VALUE THAT RECYCLERS ARE RECEIVING IN THE MARKETPLACE TODAY. IS THIRTY THREE PERCENT BELOW. SCRAP VALUE THAT WAS USED FOR THE CALCULATION SO WORK WE'RE KIND OF BACK IN THAT THE US BROUGH SPIRAL WITH REGARD TO PT. SO. PROPOSAL THAT THE BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT WAS DEVELOPED AND ADOPTED BY THE SUBCOMMITTEE LAST YEAR HAS ALL THE PIECES THE PLASTIC MARKET DEVELOPMENT MEANT. IT PROPOSAL THAT'S BEFORE YOU IS ONE OF THOSE PIECES AND WE SUPPORT THAT AND YOU KNOW I I DO WANT OF KNOWLEDGE THAT CAL RECYCLED. THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF ROOM TO MOVE IN THIS AREA BUT. IN THOSE AREAS WHERE THEY HAVE SOME ADMINISTRATIVE FLEXIBILITY IS THEY'VE TAKEN ACTION WE TOOK ACTION AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR TO. TO ADJUST THEIR REGULATIONS TO PROVIDE A REASONABLE FINANCE RETURN OF ELEVEN PERCENT FOR RECYCLING CENTERS THAT WAS A VERY GOOD THING THAT THEY DID. ON JUST YESTERDAY THEY ANNOUNCED A BOMB USING THEIR EXISTING AUTHORITY TO FOCUS THE LIMITED GRANT RESOURCES THEY HAVE. ON THIS RECYCLING CLOSURE CRISIS AND ON THE. IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS KIND OF ALTERNATIVE BY BACK INFRASTRUCTURE SO I THINK THEY'RE DOING WHAT THEY CAN WITH THE TOOLS THAT THEY HAVE. I JUST THINK THAT THE STATUTE NEEDS TO BE ADJUSTED ARM TO FIX THESE PROBLEMS TO INCREASE PAYMENTS ON YOU HAD THAT IN YOUR BUDGET PROPOSAL LAST YEAR. PASSED BE PART OF THE BUDGET PROPOSAL AGAIN THIS YEAR. THANK YOU. IF THERE SAID NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS WILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR REMARKS TODAY AND. CALL UP THE OF WATER RESOURCES. AND THE AS THE DEPARTMENT IS SIR. TAKING IT SAYS SEE TARA OUT BEFORE YOU BEGAN AYE. WANTED. JUST MAKE A COMMENT ABOUT SOMETHING THAT'S NOT ON THE AGENDA TODAY BUT. THAT THAT'S THE A. A AND ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED IN A. A WITH THIS DEPARTMENT ALMOST A YEAR AGO BACK IN JUNE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBERS BONTA AND TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA AND SENATOR DODD. A REGARDING THE MALLARD FORMS CONSERVATION BANQUET OPPROBRIUM AND. OTHER CONCERNED THAT THERE'S BEEN A A LITTLE PROGRESS ON OUR ON THAT PROGRAM. THEY ALSO HAVE HAD LITTLE OR NO RESPONSE FROM THE DEPARTMENT AND SO THEY ASKED. ME TO MAKE AN INQUIRY I DID THAT SEVERAL MONTHS AGO AND THERE'S BEEN VERY LITTLE RESPONSE TO ME OR MY STAFF. AT AT THAT AT THIS POINT AND SO ARE A. ARE REGRETTABLY HAVE TO EXPRESS AND FRUSTRATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT FOR THE. LACK OF RESPONSE ON THE ISSUE IN ASK GOD THAT YOU. OF. PLEASE THE. OF MAKE SURE THAT CHAD. THERE'S A A A SPECIFIC RESPONSE ON THE PROGRESS OF FLOOD A OF THAT PROGRAM AND WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE. TO. MOVE IT FORWARD. MR HIRES A POSSIBLE TO RESPOND TO THAT AND HAVE A HORSE RATE THINKS WE OPPORTUNITY AND CHRISTOPHER TRAIL DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT WATER RESOURCES. WE WILL ABSOLUTELY MAKE SURE THAT THE COMMUNICATION ISSUE IS RESOLVED AND. APOLOGIES FOR THAT. I WILL SAY THOUGH THAT WHILE THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LACK OF COMMUNICATION THERE'S BEEN NO LACK OF. WORK ON THE PROJECT HAS BEEN A LOT OF GOOD PROGRESS MADE MORE THERE HAS BEEN IN YEARS. IT IS A SIGNIFICANT HABITAT RESTORATION OPPORTUNITY THE PROVIDE RESOURCES IS IN THE BUSINESS OF HABITAT RESTORATION IN THE DELTA RIGHT NOW WE ARE ALL IN ON THIS KIND OF WORK. AND A LOT OF PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE WITH THE MALLARD FARMS AND OWNERSHIP GROUP. AND THE REPRESENTATIVES AND OTHERS AND I THINK WE'RE ACTUALLY ON A SOLID PATH TOWARDS AND A PROJECT SO WE'LL GET THOSE DETAILS TO YOU IN LOOKING FOR TO MORE.

GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS. MY NAME THEIR COKE ON THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR FLOOD MANAGEMENT DAM SAFETY. ALONG WITH DEPUTY TRAIL HERE WILL KIND OF BE BOUNCING BACK AND FORTH AS WE RUN THROUGH THESE ISSUES ALONG WITH SOME STAFF THAT WILL BRING OUT. GREAT CENTER OF THE DAM SAFETY TRAILER BILL. THE BILL LANGUAGE THAT BASICALLY CLARIFIES THE PROCESS FOR DAM OWNERS BUT THERE IS AN EXISTING OR PARTIAL EAP ACTIONS. OR EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN WHERE INNOVATION MAP AS OF MARCH FIRST TWENTY SEVENTEEN PARTICULARLY IN REGARDS TO THOSE DAMS THAT HAVE CRITICAL PERTINENT STRUCTURES. THIS CHANGE ALSO REQUIRES THAT DAM OWNERS WITH THESE PARTIAL EP'S. AND INNOVATION MAPS THAT THEY DEVELOP A TIMELINE BY WHICH THEY WILL SUBMIT. THERE COMPREHENSIVE EAP THEN DID IT INUNDATION MAPS INCLUDING THOSE WITH THE PART AND STRUCTURES AT IT IN A TIMELY MANNER. AND THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT IT DOES IT JUST CLARIFIES LANGUAGE FROM LAST YEAR. GREAT AT HIGHS I DON'T THINK LA OF HAS THE COMMENTS ON THIS PAGE AND THERE'S NO CONCERNS THANK YOU DEPARTMENT FINANCE SO LET'S MOVE ON ISSUE SEVENTY. THE ONE MOMENT WHERE IN CALL STAFF STEP PERSONNEL. GOOD MORNING CHAIR BLOOM AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME'S COMEY ARGUE VECI I MANAGE STATEWIDE INTEGRATED WATER MANAGEMENT AT THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. AND I'VE BEEN SPONSOR. MANAGEMENT SPONSOR OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OPEN AND TRANSPARENT. WATER DATA ACT OR ALSO KNOWN AS AB SEVENTEEN FIFTY FIVE. THE REQUEST. THAT WE HAVE BEFORE YOU IS A CONTINUATION. OF EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS AND THEN A BASELINE OF FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF. THIS OPEN WATER DATA PLATFORM. THE EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. IT WILL BE ALLOCATED AMONGST THREE OF THE NAMED A. AGENCIES IN THE ACT. DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES WOULD GET FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND. DOT THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND THIS IS THE SAME ALLOCATION. WELL AS LAST YEAR AND ALL THIS FUNDING WOULD BE FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL LICENSE PLATE FUND. THE THE WORK WITH THE THE FUNDING WOULD BE USED TO. ASSIST THE AGENCIES TO TRANSFORM AND BEGIN POSTING DATA ON. THE PLATFORM THAT HAS BEEN. UNDER DEVELOPMENT WE WILL CONTINUE. ESTABLISHING PROTOCOLS AND STANDARDS. A AND WE WERE THEY ONGOING FUNDING THE BASELINE FUNDING WOULD BE FOR THE ONGOING MAINTENANCE. OF THE PLATFORM I JUST WANTED TO ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WHILE THE W. OUR IS MAKING THIS PRESENTATION. THIS HAS BEEN A VERY COLLABORATIVE MULTI AGENCY PROCESS IN FACT THIS. BUDGET REQUEST WAS COORDINATED BY THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH AND THEOTHER. STATE AGENCIES. AND I'D ALSO IN CONCLUSION LIKE TO. TAKES OPPORTUNITY TO NOTE THAT. THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ARE CCSD HAS SCHEDULED A BRIEFING ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB SEVENTEEN FIFTY FIVE. AT THE NOON HOUR TOMORROW HERE IN THE CAPITAL. GREAT THANK YOU LEO DO YOU KNOW CONCERNS EXPRESSED. GREAT THANK YOU ISSUE EIGHTEEN. IF ANYTHING. ON THE JOINT OPERATION CENTER ONCE AGAIN WHEN ASKED BECAUSE SOME. JOINING HIM TO COME UP AND TALK ABOUT IT. GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN OF CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. MY NAME SHAUN ACHES FROM WITH PART WATER RESOURCES EXECUTIVE OFFICE. I DID A REYES REQUESTING NAINA SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND AND. OF THE PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE TO ENTER INTO A BILL TO SUIT POLICE. GOC IS OF A SILLY THAT HOUSES BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL. ENTITIES AND IT'S. CLEVERLY CLUB REALLY MANAGES AND OPERATES THE. FEDERAL WATER PROJECTS AND RESPONSES THEY QUITE EMERGENCIES. THESE GROUPS HAVE COLLABORATED SINCE THE SIXTIES THEY REALIZED IN THE EIGHTIES THAT IT WOULD BE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF NOT ONLY THEIR PROGRAMS BUT FOR THE STATE TO. ACTUALLY. BE HOUSE THAT ONE LOCATION. THAT DID OCCUR AND THE EARLY NINETIES OF MID AND FORCING WAS JUST AN INTRO LOCATION AT THAT TIME I DID NOT MEET THE ESSENTIAL SERVICE NEEDS FOR. THE DIVISION OF FLOOD MANAGEMENT. IN ADDITION TO THE CENTRAL SERVICE NEEDS OF SENSE OF THE EARLY NINETIES WE HAVE. BASICALLY HOMELAND SECURITY REGULATIONS ARE TO COME INTO PLACE THAT. AFFECT OF MANY OF OUR OPERATIONS THERE AND. REQUIRED. NEEDS FOR NOT ONLY SPACE BUT I T. PROTOCOLS THAT HAVE MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO CONTINUE TO CONFORM. AT THAT LOCATION. THANK YOU. ELLIOTT. HAD JUST A HIGHLIGHT AS IS NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA WHILE THE REQUEST BEFORE YOU IS RELATIVELY MODEST LESS THAN A MILLION DOLLARS THIS IS TO ENTER INTO A LEASE AND. TO BUILD OF A BUILDING THAT WOULD BE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE. AND YOU'LL HAVE FIVE FIVE YEARS. OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS THEY'RE ANTICIPATING SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION A YEAR A YEAR IN ANNUAL COSTS AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT MOVING COSTS SO IT IS IT IS OF. A BIGGER DECISION THAN JUST ABOUT WHAT IS. BEFORE YOU TODAY THAT YOU'D BE SETTING IN MOTION WE LOOKED INTO THIS PRETTY CAREFULLY AND FELT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE DUE DILIGENCE AND LOOKING AT ALL OF THE OPPORTUNITIES AND OPTIONS FOR. UP PURSUING THIS IT IS SOMEWHAT COMPLICATED AND WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL PARTNERS AND IS A VERY SPECIALIZED BUILDING HAS A LOT OF REALLY. UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS SO WE DO THINK THE REQUEST IS JUSTIFIED BUT TO PUT JOHN NOTICED THAT THAT NEW WILL HAVE FUTURE REQUESTS FOR SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AMOUNTS OF FUNDING ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROJECT. CONSIDER MYSELF NOTIFIED. DEPARTMENT FINANCE ADJACENT HOUSE DEPARTMENT INANCE WE KNOW THE LEGISLATURE'S WHERE THE SPENT A LONG TERM MULTI A PROCESS TO GET THIS PROJECT READY AND WE FEEL CONFIDENT WE FINALLY FOUND THE CRACK PATH FORWARD AND WE SUPPORT PROPOSAL. THANK YOU AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS IN THE STAFF REPORT WHICH I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO. GET INTO DETAIL ABOUT HERE. TODAY BUT ALAS THAT. TO THE EXTENT IT'S A. REQUESTED BY. BUDGET STAFF THAT TO BE IN COMMUNICATION OF THOSE ANSWERS BE PROVIDED CONSERVE HAPPEN WERE PRETTY. QUICK YOU. ISSUE NUMBER NINETEEN PLEASE. GREAT MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND STAFF CHRIS TRAIL FROM THE DEPARTMENT ONCE AGAIN. SO AS YOU ARE. VERY WELL AWARE DEPARTMENTS IN OUR OTHER AND SISTER AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS THAT THE STATE WHETHER IT'S THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD OR OTHER. OTHER PARTNERS MAKE A LOT OF INVESTMENTS IN WATER CONSERVATION RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE WHETHER IT'S FAR WATER USE EFFICIENCY WHETHER THROUGH WATER RECYCLING. AND THE KINDS OF BIG CAPITAL TYPES OF INVESTMENTS THAT I'M A REALLY NECESSARY TO MAKE AYE CONSERVATION JULIA CALIFORNIA WAY OF LIFE. CONSISTENT WITH THE GOVERNOR'S WATER ACTION PLAN. AND ONE OF THE PIECES THAT'S REALLY FUNDAMENTAL THAT SOMETIMES DOESN'T GET AND. AS MUCH AIR TIME AS MAYBE AND SOMETHING THAT I SHOULDN'T AM SO TO SPEAK IS THIS THIS THIS OTHER FUNDAMENTAL PIECE AND THAT IS PUBLIC EDUCATION PUBLIC AWARENESS. HOW DO YOU CHANGE PUBLIC BEHAVIOR IN APPRECIATION FOR AROUND? WATER CONSERVATION WATER USE EFFICIENCY AND BOTH THOSE PIECES WHETHER IT'S THE THE PREPARATIONS THAT YOU ALL MAKE WITH US FOR FOR INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT. PAIRED WITH PUBLIC EDUCATION AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TO MODEST ONGOING INVESTMENT. THREE UNDER THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM ENVIRONMENTAL LICENSE PLATE FUND. AND TO THE DEPARTMENT TO A MOVIE A SAFE CALIFORNIA WATER. PROGRAM IN HOUSE IN THE WHOLE IDEA HERE IS THAT THE STATE LEVEL IT MAKES SENSE TO HAVE COORDINATED AND CONTENT CREATION IF YOU WILL WHAT'S THE MESSAGING AROUND THIS AND WHAT WHAT ARE THE FACTS WITH THE FIGURES YOU WANT TO GIVE OUT. AND THEN PARTNERING WITH OUR LOCAL WATER AGENCIES THAT THEY CAN THEN TAKE THAT INFORMATION AND USE THEIR LOCAL DOLLARS. TO RUN ANY SORT ABOUT CAMPAIGN THAT THEY THINK IS APPROPRIATE GIVEN THEIR PARTICULAR REGION'S NEEDS AND SO REALLY THIS IS A. CONSOLIDATION IF YOU WILL OF THE EFFORT IT'S ABOUT EIGHT YEARS OLD. AND INSURERS AND ONGOING INVESTMENT AND FOCUS ON AGAIN THIS BEHAVIORAL. AND AND PUBLIC AWARENESS ASPECT OF REALLY MAKING AND WATER CONSERVATION MORE OF MORE WAY OF LIFE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO THAT'S THE GIST OF IT AND APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU COULD AGREE WITH YOU MORE THINK THAT MESSAGING THE MARKETING OR IF YOU WILL AROUND FTA WATER CONSERVATION AND. IS ONGOING IT CAN'T STOP WERE UPON YOU KNOW FIGHTING AGAINST THINGS LIKE TODAY IT RAINS AND PEOPLE START TO THINK OF. NOT SUCH A PROBLEM IT'S AN ONGOING PROBLEM AND IT TO. BEARS REMINDING EVERYONE. TO EVERYONE. SEEING NO QUESTIONS ALEJO NO CONCERNS OF THAT PART OF THE FINANCE. LET'S MOVE ON TO YOUR LAST ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY. IT ONCE AGAIN ERIC COPE WITH THE DEPARTMENT. DVRS REQUESTING GENERAL FUND ADDRESS HIGH RISK URBAN AREAS FOR THE USE OF BOND FUNDS IS LIMITED. PROPOSITION ONE EIGHTY AND EIGHTY FOUR HAVE ALL BEEN ALLOCATED TO EXISTING PROJECTS. AND BOND FUNDS ARE LIMITED. MOVING FORWARD THE CURRENT CAN OPPOSED FUTURE BOND FUNDS ARE LIMITED UP FOR THE USE OF URBAN. PROJECT THAT WE DO WITH THE UNITED STATES ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS IMPROPER REGION AND MAINTENANCE BECAUSE THESE ACTIVITIES ARE NOT USUALLY MULTI BENEFIT NATURE WHICH THE NEW BONDS. REQUIRE. SO DELIVER REQUESTS INCLUDES UNDER SEVENTY MILLION FOR FIVE YEARS FOR HIGH RISK URBAN AREAS THESE FUNDS ALLOW US TO PARTNER WITH THE UNITED STATES ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS ON FEDERALLY LED PROJECTS. THAT CONTRIBUTE TO TWO HUNDRED YEAR LEVEL FLOOD PROTECTION.WILL ALSO LEVERAGE AN ESTIMATED SIX HUNDRED NINETY MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDS. WE ALSO REQUEST ONGOING FUNDS OF TWENTY FIVE MILLION YEAR TO MAINTAIN THE FLOOD SYSTEM. TIMELY MAINTENANCE IS CRITICAL AND HELPS PREVENT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. A IN THE FUTURE THESE FUNDS WILL PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR COST SHARING WITH LOCAL MAINTAINING AGENCIES. THE FUNDS WILL ALSO BE AVAILABLE FOR PRIORITY PROJECTS THAT REDUCE POTENTIAL STATE LIABILITY. I HAVE FINALLY THERE'S A ONE TIME REQUEST FOR ONE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE CENTRAL IF A PROTECTION BOARD WHICH WILL COME OUT OF THE FIRST YEAR OF THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION. TO ASSESS AND DO A FEASIBILITY STUDY ON. THE SACRAMENTO WORKING DRAINS DISTRICT AND ITS AUTHORITY TO POTENTIALLY LEVY FEES IN THE FUTURE. BUT THAT. HAPPEN ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU LA JOH. ESOS NOTED THERE ARE REALLY TWO COMPONENTS OF THIS PROPOSAL A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION AND ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FROM THAT WOULD BE USED TO LEVERAGE SIGNIFICANCE AMOUNT OF SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF FEDERAL FUNDING SO WE THINK THIS IS A. GOOD USE OF ONE TIME GENERAL FUND THAN TWENTY FIVE MILLION ANG. FOR MAINTENANCE ON THE STATE FLOOD SYSTEM FOR WHICH THE STATE HAS RESPONSIBILITY. FOR MAINTAINING AND LIABILITY WHEN IT'S NOT MAINTAINED SO CAN WE THINK THAT'S A WORTHWHILE. AND USE OF FUNDING THOUGH IT IS ONGOING AT THE DEPARTMENT HAS SOME INTERESTING IDEAS THAT THEY'VE EXPRESSED ABOUT TRYING TO USE THAT TO TO LEVERAGE AND CREATE INCENTIVES FOR LOCAL MAINTAINING AGENCIES ON THAT PORTIONS OF THE STATE SYSTEM THAT LOCAL AGENCIES ARE ARE HELPING TO MAINTAIN. SO THAT'S SORT OF A NEW EFFORT IT'S IT'S INTERESTING AND ENCOURAGING I THINK PROBABLY SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO CHECK BACK IN ON NEXT YEAR TO SEE HOW THAT'S GOING AND. WHETHER THERE ADDITIONAL STEPS THAT THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO TAKE TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN BUT FOR NOW WE THINK THIS IS A WORTHWHILE PROPOSAL. IF YOU. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS FATE. WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ALL FIVE OF FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES ISSUES. GOOD MORNING AGAIN ROBERT COR FROM THE LOCAL GROUP ON BEHALF OF THE SACRAMENTO AREA FLOOD CONTROL AGENCY WHERE WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS ITEM AS AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE. UNTIL AT SOME DETAILED LA O. THIS DOES LEVERAGE NEARLY THREE QUARTERS OF A BILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL FUNDING. AND. THIS IS ALSO SUPPORTED BY RATE PAYERS A FEE INCREASES WHICH HAVE BEEN ENACTED OVER THE LAST A COUPLE OF YEARS. THROUGH THROUGH POPULAR OF VOTE WE. ALSO HAVE SUBMITTED A LETTER. AND WE ENJOY SUPPORT FROM THE FLIGHT CONTROL CAUCUS NOW AND WE THOROUGHLY AGREE WITH THE LA OR IS ANALYSIS IN THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE A REPORT WHICH WAS SUBMITTED YESTERDAY. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN NOT COMMITTEE HOW MY NAME IS GILBERT CHO SEALED WITH THEM BECAME ENGINEERS. WHERE FLOOD CONTROL CONSULTANTS TO THE US CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD CONTROL ASSOCIATION AS WELL AS INDIVIDUAL? RECLAMATION DISTRICTS AND FLED AGENCIES IN THE DELTA AND US EGGMAN VALLEY AND WE ARE SUPPORTIVE THIS MEASURES HAVE JUST EXPLAINED BY MISTER GORE IT'S CAN LEVERAGE A LOT OF MONEY. AND ALSO IT WE'VE SEEN IN THE DELTA AND SOME OF THE PROJECTS THAT WE'VE RUN INTO DELTA SOME A STATE FUNDED. NON THE IT THE LOCALS COME UP WITH A LOT OF MONEY WHICH AND IN ZEPA PARLAYING SOME OF THEIR. MONEY INTO A HIGHER FLOOD CONTROL LEVELS THINKING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT CLOSES OUT OUR DISCUSSION ON THE DEED OF YOURS ISSUES AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS. WE GOT THE CDC UP NEXT ONE ISSUE. MORNING MR MORNING AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE. I'M LARRY GOLD'S VENOM EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY CONSERVATION DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION. A IN THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE YOU WILL FIND A THREE POINT ZERO TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR B. CDC TO RELOCATE ITS OFFICES FROM THE STATE OFFICE BUILDING IN SAN FRANCISCO. TO THE NEWLY RE HAVE BEEN REHABBED METRO CENTER ALSO IN DOWNTOWN SAN FRANCISCO. METRO CENTER WAS CONSTRUCTED BY THE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF BAY AREA GOVERNMENTS AND THE. LOCAL AIRPORT AND ALSO HOUSE THE SAN FRANCISCO ESTUARY PARTNERSHIP. ALL FOUR REGIONAL AGENCIES AND BC SEE OUR PARTNERS ON ANY NUMBER OF PROJECTS AS YOU CAN IMAGINE MAINLY RELATING TO RISING SEA LEVEL AN ADAPTATION ALONG THE BAY SHORE LINE. AND A A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO WHEN THIS PROJECT STARTED THE COMMISSION. A DECIDED TO MOVE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE IF POSSIBLE INTO THAT BUILDING. A WE BELIEVE THAT THIS MERIT SUPPORT FOR TWO REASONS FIRST OF ALL FROM A POLICY ISSUE. RBC DC STAFF WORK ON A DAILY BASIS WITH EACH OF THEM WITH MEMBERS OF THE STAFF OF EACH OF THESE REGIONAL AGENCIES AND TO BE IN THE SAME BUILDING. PROVIDES TREMENDOUS LEVERAGE TREMENDOUS ENERGY SECOND IF BE CDC IS ABLE TO MOVE TO THE METRO CENTER THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WOULD THEN EXPAND. ITS FOOTPRINT DIRECTLY INTO BC DC'S CURRENT SPACE AND DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS IN TERRIBLE NEED OF X. OF EXTRA SPACE IN SAN FRANCISCO SO THAT WORKS OUT VERY WELL. FOR THE SECOND BASIC REASONS BASIC ECONOMICS. OAKLAND AND SAN FRANCISCO IN THE REST OF THE BAY AREA A COUPLE YEARS AGO BECAME THE MOST EXPENSIVE PLACE NOT ONLY TO LIVE IN THE UNITED STATES BUT ALSO TO WORK. TRYING TO FIND SPACE AND IT WAS A. FOR WHICH WERE VERY APPRECIATIVE BY THE WAY. BUT ALSO IT'S ALSO CERTAINLY TO WORK. COMMERCIAL SPACE IS NOT ONLY AT A PREMIUM BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE THE COST B. CDC WILL RECEIVE BELOW MARKET RATE AT. OF THE NEW HEADQUARTERS AND IT'LL LABELS DOJ NOT TO HAVE TO GO OUT AND TRY TO FIND SPACE FOR ITS STAFF AT WHAT WOULD BE NO DOUBT VERY VERY EXPENSIVE PER SQUARE FOOT RATES. THANK YOU ALEJO. YES SO WHILE THE PROGRAMMATIC BENEFITS FOR BE CDC TO BE CO LOCATED WITH THEIR PARTNERS ARE VALUABLE WE DIDN'T THINK THAT WAS ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY THIS EXPENDITURE ON ITS OWN SO WE LOOKED INTO A QUITE CAREFULLY. AND LOOKED INTO DOJ'S OFFICE NEEDS AND ASSOCIATED COSTS AND DID FIND THAT OVERALL THIS APPROACH IS THE LEAST COSTLY. ALTERNATIVE FOR THE STATE WHEN YOU ENCOMPASS THE NEEDS OF BOTH AGENCIES BE CDC AND HAD DOJ SO WE DO FEEL THAT THIS PROPOSAL BEFORE HE WAS JUST FINE. THANK YOU I I THINK I THINK IT'S A REALLY GOOD THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS HOLISTICALLY AND NOT JUST TO A IN THE AREA KIND OF A SILENT APPROACH. YOU CAN LET BERMAN FINANCE CHAIR ENDED UP THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOTE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION DID. IN DEPTH PURPLE OR COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF THIS PROPOSAL AND FROM STATEWIDE BASIS. AND ALSO BE CITIES IN THE OJ BASIS MAKES THE MOST SENSE OF. WITH IT WE HAD TO A MEETING OR TWO GO A CONVERSATION WITH THE. COASTAL COMMISSION AND SUGGESTED THAT. THEY MIGHT. DO BETTER. IF THEY WEREN'T IN SAN FRANCISCO. ANY LONGER I REALIZE YOU'RE CRINGING IN THAT. CARRIES WITH IT SOME. A SOME IMPLICATIONS. BUT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S AVAILABLE REALLY TO. IN THE SAME WAY TO BE CDC WHICH THAT IS CORRECT BECAUSE NEEDS TO BELONG. BCD SI IN ADDITION TO BEING BY STATUTE REQUIRED TO BE IN SAN FRANCISCO SIMPLY TRYING TO FIND SPACE IN ANY OF THE NINE COUNTIES IS REMARKABLY DIFFICULT. AND UNDERSTOOD THE MISTER MULLIN JUST A BRIEF COMMENT AS A FORMER MEMBER OF THE NPC. WHEN THERE'S A BUILDING WITH SOME CONTROVERSY. WAS NOT ACTIVATED AND REALLY THAT VISION WAS TO BRING ALL THOSE REGIONAL AGENCIES UNDER ONE ROOF. A IN ONE LOCATION AND ITHINK IT'S GOING TO PROVE TO BE SO CERTAINLY OVER THE LONG HAUL A BY A BENEFIT. OFFER ALL OF THOSE ENTITIES AND OUT ULTIMATELY OFFER THAT FOR THE TAXPAYERS AS WELL GIVEN THE VALUE OF REAL ESTATE IN DOWNTOWN SAN. DISCUSS I APPLAUD. YOUR EFFORTS. IN THAT REGARD THERE'S A REFERENCE IN THE STAFF REPORT ABOUT MTC. HAVING SOME CONCERN ABOUT THE. COSTS FOR TEN IMPROVEMENTS IN SOME ISSUE THEY HAVE THEIR COULD YOU JUST. VERY BRIEFLY DESCRIBE WHAT THAT IS BUT I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH OF COURSE WITH MOVING FOR. SO DTS HAS A BASIS FOR PROVIDING A COST PER SQUARE FOOT PRETEND IMPROVEMENTS SINCE A REGIONAL BASIS. AND SAN FRANCISCO THAT IT'S A HUNDRED FORTY DOLLARS PER SQUARE FOOT. THE ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THAT AND. THAT'S WHERE THIS REQUEST COMES FROM. MISTER KALRA. BUT I JUST WANTED. THOSE IN RAMONES COMMENTS I WAS CHAIR THAT AREA ERIC BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT AT THE TIME AND THEN ON THE BOARD AT THE TIME THAT. SOME THESE DECISIONS ARE MADE CONSOLIDATION THAT ALTHOUGH HE UNDERSTOOD. I WOULD HAVE A LOT OF START UP COSTS REALLY CREATE. A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF BOTH FISSION SEASONAL LONG RUN WITH ALL THOSE AGENCIES. CLICK YOU. AND TAG YOU GIVE ME AN OPENING SO. I WILL USE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THAT YOUR WORK FORCE. FACES A DAUNTING CHALLENGE WHEN IT COMES TO FINDING AFFORDABLE PLACES TO LIVE AND DEATHS OF THE A HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS IS PLAYING OUT IN REAL TIME. IN IN YOUR WORLD BUT THE. THE. COROLLARY OF THAT TO WHICH IS A. EXTREME PRESSURE ON COMMERCIAL OF A PROPERTY BECAUSE OF. FRANKLY THE SUCCESS OF THE STATE AND PARTICULARLY. THE BAY AREA A BAY AREA. IS A PRESSING NEED AS AS A PRESSING ISSUE AS AS WELL. AND ADVISER ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM. CHAIRMAN DUNCAN EFFECTORS REPRESENT METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION ON VERGE COMMITTEE HOLD THIS OPEN SO THAT COMMISSION STAFF CONTINUE TO HAVE DIALOGUE WITH BERMAN FINANCE IN THE COMMITTEE STAFF. TO ENSURE THAT THE APPROPRIATE REIMBURSEMENT OF FOR TEN IMPROVEMENTS THAT IS SPACE PROVIDE THANK YOU. THANK YOU YOU DIDN'T URGE WERE GOING TO HOLD IT UP. AND THAT WAS THAT WILL MOVE ON NOW TO YOU VERY MUCH. OUR NEXT TO A. COMMISSION THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION. HOUSE ONE ITEM BEFORE US. GOOD MORNING OR GOOD AFTERNOON NAP. IT IS THE NO IT'S GOOD MORNING ALRIGHT. KNOWS TWELVE A AT. THIS IS TWO MINUTES SLOW. THE ORAL SCREWED UP HERE GOOD AFTERNOON TODAY I'M GOOD AFTERNOON. CARE BLOOM COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS CALLING CONNOR AND THE ASSISTANT EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION. ISSUE TWENTY TWO IT'S A REQUEST FOR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM THE LAKE TAHOE SCIENCE AND LAKE IMPROVEMENT ACCOUNT. TO CONTRACT FOR A CONSULTANT FOR INDEPENDENT STUDY OF RENT SETTING METHODOLOGIES. FOR LEASES OF SOVEREIGN LAND AT LAKE TAHOE. THE BED OF LAKE TAHOE ON THE CALIFORNIA SIDE IS STATE OWNED SOVEREIGN LAND USES SOVEREIGN LAND FOR THINGS LIK COMMERCIAL MARINAS PRIVATE RECREATIONAL PEERS AND MORNING. SHE'S A MOORING BUOYS REQUIRES A LEASE FOR THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY LEASES AT LAKE TAHOE. THE GREAT MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE FOR PRIVATE RECREATIONAL PEERS AND MORE EMPLOYEES. AND NO RENT FOR THESE PIERS EMPLOYEES SET THROUGH YOU SAID BENCHMARK RENTAL RATES. BENCHMARKS ARE USED TO ESTABLISH UNIFORM RENTAL RATES IN SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS WITH LARGE CONCENTRATIONS HAVE SIMILAR FACILITIES SUCH AS IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA THE DELTA THE SACRAMENTO RIVER IN THE COLORADO RIVER. THE USE OF BENCHMARKS IMPROVES CONSISTENCY AND TRANSPARENCY THROUGHOUT A GEOGRAPHIC REGION. IN CROUP IMPROVE STAFF EFFICIENCY IN SETTING AND ADJUSTING RENT FOR LARGE NUMBERS OF LEASES AND SAVES TIME AND MONEY FOR BOTH THE APPLICANT AND THE STATE. THE BENCHMARK RENTAL RATES ARE DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION STAFF AND ARE UPDATED EVERY FIVE YEARS. DEVELOPING THE APPROPRIATE METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING A FAIR MARKET RENTAL VALUE FOR SOVEREIGN WATERCOLOR COVERED STATE PLANTS IS INHERENTLY CHALLENGING. THERE IS NO OPEN MARKET FOR SOVEREIGN LAND AND THUS NO DIRECT COMPARABLE SALES FOR APPRAISAL PURPOSES BECAUSE IT'S CONSTITUTIONALLY PROHIBITED TO SELF SOVEREIGN WATER COVERED CA PLANTS. THEREFORE THE COMMISSION HISTORICALLY HAS UTILIZED A COMPARISON OF RENTS FOR OTHER SIMILAR LAND OR FACILITIES AS ALLOWED FOR UNDER EXCLUSION REGULATIONS. TO DEVELOP THE BENCHMARK METHODOLOGY AS A MOTIVE MOST EQUITABLE APPROACH TO DETERMINE FAIR MARKET RENTAL VALUE.

THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU ALEJO NO CONCERNS AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. QUESTIONS FROM THE DYESS IS THERE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM. SEEING NONE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION ONLY APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU. EXCEPT FOR A STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. AGAIN WITH ONE ISSUE. CHAIR BLOOM AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AYE MANDY SAWYER ASSISTANT CHIEF COUNSEL FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. THIS ITEM INVOLVES THE BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR TWO MILLION DOLLARS AND NINE POSITIONS.TO PROVIDE FOR AND ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS OFFICE WITHIN THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. PROVIDING QUALIFIED AND IMPARTIAL PROFESSIONAL HEARING OFFICERS FOR ADJUDICATIVE PROCEEDINGS. I ESPECIALLY ENFORCEMENT MATTERS PART IN WATER RIGHTS. LAST SESSION THE LEGISLATURE PASSED AB THREE THIRTEEN WHICH WERE PROVIDED FOR ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING OFFICERS BUT HAD SEVERAL PROBLEMS AND THE GOVERNOR VETOED THE BILL. IN HIS VETO MESSAGE FOR GOVERNOR DIRECTED THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL. AGENCY TO REPORT BACK ON THE POTENTIAL FOR. THE USE OF ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING OFFICERS ARE IN WATER RIGHTS MATTERS IN THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD THIS PROPOSAL IS THE EFFECTUATE XIN. A OF THAT RECOMMENDATION. I INCLUDES TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO ESTABLISH THE ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS OFFICE. AND ESTABLISH PROCEDURES FOR USE OF ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING OFFICERS AND TIMELY DECISIONS ARE IN THOSE MATTERS. IT ALSO PROVIDES FOR FUNDING WITHOUT THE NEED FOR A GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURE. THESE ARE ONGOING PROGRAM EXPENDITURES NOT A ONE TIME EXPENDITURE MAKING THE USE OF GENERAL FUND A INAPPROPRIATE. THE EXISTING FEE STATUTE FOR WATER RIGHTS A PROVIDES FOR ANNUAL ADJUSTMENTS TO ADJUST THE FEES BASED ON APPROPRIATIONS. FROM THE WATER RIGHTS FUND BUT WITHOUT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT COULD BE USED FOR ONLY ABOUT SEVENTY PERCENT. OF THE COST OF THIS PROPOSAL THAT'S BECAUSE THE EXISTING FEE STRUCTURE CHARGES. ABOUT ONE CLASS OF WATER RIGHT HOLDERS HOLDERS OF WATER RIGHT PERMIT TEASING LICENSEES OF BUT NOT OTHERS. WHOSE ACTIVITIES DO CREATE THE NEED FOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS THAT THIS WOULD FUND ARE AND WHOSE RIGHTS ARE ALSO BENEFITTED. OF BY HAVING A FAIR AND EFFECTIVE HEARING PROCESS. ALL THE WATER RIGHT HOLDERS BOTH THOSE CURRENT ASSEMBLY TO THE CURRENT FEES AND THOSE WOULD BE SAID IT THE NEW FEE WHICH I WOULD ADD IT'S JUST FOR THE COST OF THIS PROGRAM. NOT OVERALL COSTS OF WATER RIGHTS. DIVERT AND USE WATER WHICH BY LAW IS PROPERTY OF THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE THEY PAY NOTHING FOR THE PROPERTY ITSELF. THIS IS JUST SUGGESTING THAT THEY SHOULD PAY A FEE TO COVER THE COST. FOR AN ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS OFFICE TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL PARTIES ALL WATER RIGHT HOLDERS GET FAIR AND EFFICIENT HERE. SO IF I UNDERSTAND THAT. CORRECTLY CURRENTLY THE. THE BOARD ITSELF. HERE'S ALL OF THESE COMPLAINTS THAT'S RIGHT BUT HEARING PROCESS PROVIDES THAT EVEN OF THE FULL FIVE BOARD MEMBER HERE'S A HINT MATTER OR AN INDIVIDUAL BOARD MATTER MEMBER. AS HEARING OFFICER HERE'S THE MATTER AND THEN PRESENTS THE RECOMMENDED ISN'T DECISION TO THE FULL BOARD WHICH VOTES ON THE MATTER AND THE PROCESS THAT YOU'RE PRESENTING TO US TODAY WOULD REPLACE THE EXISTING CA. HEARING SYSTEMS THAT RIGHT FOR SPECIFIC WATER RIGHTS ENFORCEMENT MATTERS IT WOULD HAVE THE HEARING OFFICER. OF ISSUE A DECISION THAT IS FINAL BUT SAID IT TO RECONSIDERATION OF AN AGGRIEVED PARTY CAN SEEK RECONSIDERATION. BY THE FULL STATE WATER SOURCES CONTROL BOARDS FOR OTHER MATTERS THE HEARING OFFICE WOULD ASK ACT AS THE HEARING. OFFICER. TAKING TESTIMONY HANDLING THEY THE DECISION BUT WOULD PREPARE RECOMMENDED DECISION TO THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD WHICH WOULD VOTE TO VOTE ON THE MATTER BASICALLY SOME OF THE SIMPLEST MATTERS. WOULD BE DECIDED BY ORDER OF THE HEARING OFFICER IN THE MORE COMPLEX ONES THE HEARING OFFICER WOULD ACT AS HEARING OFFICER BUT PRESENT THE HEARING OFFICERS DRAFT ORDER. TO THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD IN EITHER CASE OF VERRES APRILIA PROHIBITION AGAINST EX PARTE CONTACTS WHICH WOULD PREVENT THE HEARING OFFICER FROM HAVING. DISCUSSIONS WITH BOARD MEMBER SO EVERYTHING'S TRANSPARENT. THANK YOU. A ALEJO JOHN MARTIN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND AS NOTED IN THE ENGINE DE THIS PROPOSAL RELATES TO AB THREE THIRTEEN WHICH WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR LAST YEAR AND THIS PROPOSAL PROVIDES A DIFFERENT STRUCTURE. FOR HEARING WATER RIGHTS ACTIONS THAN AB THREE THIRTEEN ESTABLISHES A NEW PROGRAM AND AT ONE WHICH THE LEGISLATURE'S RECENTLY DEBATED THROUGH THE POLICY PROCESS. TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER WHETHER THIS PROPOSAL SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN THE POLICY COMMITTEES. THANK YOU AYE DEPARTMENT PLANTS. SURE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND HOLD DEPARTMENT FINANCE. IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE BECAUSE THE PROPOSAL WAS IN RESPONSE TO THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE. I ONCE THIS PLAN BECAME READY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RESOURCES WERE INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET ACT. AND TRAILER WILL BE NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT THAT. ALRIGHT THANK YOU. PUBLIC COMMENT. GOOD AFTERNOON ROBERT OR FROM THE BALK A GROUP ON BEHALF OF THE KINGS RIVER WATER AUTHORITY WHICH IS THE STATE'S LARGEST PRIVATE RIGHT HOLDER. KERN COUNTY WATER AGENCY AND ALSO THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF WINE GRAPE GROWERS. THOUGH THE IDEA OF A WATER RIGHTS HEARING OFFICE IS A GOOD ONE IT DESERVES TO BE VETTED AND ANALYZED ARE THOROUGHLY IT'S A COMPLEX ESSENTIAL ELEMENT. IN AS THE LA O. NOTES IT'S PERHAPS A GOOD A GRIST FOR THE UP POLICY COMMITTEE. MIL OF OUR CLIENTS AND. MOST OF THE WATER RIGHT HOLDERS ARE STRONGLY OPPOSED TO BEING THE SOURCE FOR FUNDING FOR THIS IT'S A STATEWIDE FEE. INCREASE TO PAY FOR REGIONAL AND PROGRAMMATIC ACTIONS THERE IS NO NEXUS. THAT WATER RIGHT ENFORCEMENT. ACTIONS LIKE ANY OTHER ENFORCEMENT ACTION SHOULD BE PAID FOR BY BAD ACTORS AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENTS. ALSO WOULD NOTE THAT THE CALIFORNIA WATER CODE AND YOU HAVE THE SECTIONS IN THE LETTER WE SUBMITTED. PROVIDE SUFFICIENT AUTHORITY FOR GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES TO GATHER AND ADMINISTER WATER RIGHTS RELATED FEES OF THERE IS NO ADEQUATE JUSTIFICATION IN THIS PROPOSAL. WE WERE ALSO NOTE THAT IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THIS COMMITTEE APPROVED TO BE CP FROM THE WATER BOARD. A TO ADDRESS A BACKLOG IN WATER RATES. S. BACKLOG INCLUDED OF THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE PERMITS OR FOURTEEN YEARS WORTH. A THREE HUNDRED FOUR REGISTRATIONS ARE NINE YEARS WORTH FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT PETITIONS EIGHT YEARS WORTH SIXTEEN HUNDRED LICENSES AT FORTY FOUR YEARS. STAKEHOLDERSOF MY CHAIR HAVE HAVE CONSISTENTLY ASKED FOR AN UPDATE ON THIS WE HAVE NOT YET HAD ONE. AND SO THE COMMITTEE MAY WANT TO INQUIRE ABOUT THE PRIOR BICU CP IN THE PROGRESS. THEREIN THIS BY THE WAY HAS NEVER BEEN FLOODED WITH STAKEHOLDERS WE HAVE NO INPUT IN THIS MATTER THANK YOU. GIL DEL HELP WITH WESTERN GROWERS ASSOCIATION. JUST ADDING TO MY COLLEAGUES AND CONCERNS OF. THAT CORRELATION BETWEEN AB THREE ONE THREE AND THIS HAD TRAILER BILL.IS THE STRUCTURE DOESN'T LOOK. THAT MUCH DIFFERENT. THREE ONE THREE WHICH WE SUPPORTED. WAS MORE OF AN INDEPENDENT SIDE THAT WAS NOT OVERSEEN BY THE STATE WATER BOARD. AND SO I'D LIKE YOU TO CONSIDER THAT AS YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS BE CP IN THE LANGUAGE. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS ADAM ROBIN WITH THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WATER ASSOCIATION NAKAL REPRESENTS WATER DISTRICT'S WATER COMPANIES. PRIVATE LANDOWNERS AND COMMUNITIES IN THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY LIKE TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE IN THE PREVIOUS COMMENTERS ON A NUMBER OF POINTS. I WOULD JUST EMPHASIZE THE FACT THAT. YOU KNOW WHERE WE CONTINUE TO CLOSELY REVIEW THE LANGUAGE WHICH WAS FIRST MADE AVAILABLE ON FRIDAY. WE DO THINK THAT THE UNDERLYING INTENT OF BOTH PREVIOUS POLICY ABOUT MATTERS OUTPUT PRODUCED PULSE BILLS ON THIS ISSUE AND THIS TRAILER BILL ON HAVE MERIT WE DO THINK THAT THEIR ROOMS WAYS TO MAKE THE. A WATER RIGHTS ADJUDICATORY MATTERS GENERALLY ARE MORE EFFICIENT AND FAIR AND WE ARE INTERESTED IN PURSUING THAT. SPECIFICALLY WITH RESPECT TO THIS LANGUAGE WE DO THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE I WERE INTERESTED IN THINGS LIKE ENSURING THAT ANY HEARING PROCESS. HAS IS CLEARLY DEFINED THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE RULES OF EVIDENCE ARE ON IN A NUMBER OF OTHER DETAILED MATTERS WE LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION IN THIS COMMITTEE ON THIS ISSUE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO ON A I I I TAKE IT THAT OF THIS PROPOSAL. WHICH IS. RATHER SWEEPING IN A IN A SANTA. IMPACT. HAS THE LANGUAGE HAS ONLY BEEN AVAILABLE FOR A FEW DAYS. A SINCE FRIDAY. SO. STAFF CAN HAVE TO TAKE SOME TIME TO DIGEST AND. UGH AND CONSIDERATE. I I'M A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED NOW THOUGH BUT I'M CONCERNED THAT THAT TO ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SAID THAT THERE HAD NOT BEEN AN OPPORTUNITY FOR. STAKEHOLDERS SET TO BE INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS IS THAT ACCURATE. YES WE. THE BUDGET PROCESS IS CONSIDERED CONFIDENTIAL WERE NOT ALLOWED TO SHARE BUDGET CONTROL UP BUDGET PROCESS OUTSIDE THE ADMINISTRATION IN TELE PROVE ALL WHICH. AND THEN IT WAS POSTED AS SOON AS APPROVED. OF THE PROCESS FOR SETTING FEES OUT WILL HAVE A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. AND WE ALL CRAMMED WILL HAVE THAT INPUT AS WELL AS PUBLIC HEARINGS BEFORE WE SET FEES OF THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. WE'LL START. BASICALLY NOW ESPECIALLY WITH ENACTMENT OF THE B. BILL W. STAKEHOLDER PROCESS FOR ITS IMPLEMENTATION. COOL WELL. OKAY. BUT WITH THE STRUCTURE ALREADY SET IN PLACE. BY THE BUDGETARY ACTIONS THAT TO. HAVE THAT THAT THAT WE TAKE SO THAT WOULD LIMIT THE ABILITY OF STAKEHOLDERS TO ACTUALLY HAVE AN IMPACT ON. OF HOW THIS ALL COMES TOGETHER WITH THE LEGISLATURE DECIDES IN OUR FEE SYSTEM LEGISLATURE DECIDES HOW MUCH OF THE PROGRAM BEFRIENDED BY FEES. AND HOW MUCH THE PROGRAM WILL BE PAID FOR BY THE GENERAL FUND. AND THEN THE STATE TAKES THAT DIRECTION TO DECIDE HOW TO SPREAD THE THE FEES BUT YOU'RE RIGHT THE LEGISLATURE DECIDES. IN ITS ANNUAL BUDGET. HOW MUCH OF THIS PROGRAM WILL BE COVERED BY FEES? OKAY UM WE HAVE OTHER QUESTIONS THAT I I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THE POINT TOO MUCH. HERE TODAY BECAUSE OF THIS I AM GOING TO BE HELD OPEN AND OUR STAFFS WILL LIVE A GIVE US SOME. US SOME FEEDBACK OF. I JUST WANT PLEDGES A HIKER TIME YOU KNOW NEURO EYES WANNA OF ICE ONE ECHO OF THE CHAIRMAN'S CONCERNS. SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. WELL THE STAKEHOLDERS WERE NOT INVOLVED IN THIS BUDGET TRAILER THAT. THIS BUDGET TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WOULD ESTABLISH SOMETHING AND AND. THE FEES WOULD THEN BE THAT WOULD THAT THE FEES THAT WOULD ENGAGE THE STAKEHOLDERS. IT WOULD THAT BE THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE WHEN YOU THAT WHAT THE SINGLE INVOLVE NATIONAL. STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAM BEFORE WE ACTUALLY ENGAGE IN A FEW DISCUSSION I AGAIN I THINK IT'S. I THINK IT'S GOOD MOVE LEGISLATURE'S PREROGATIVE TO DECIDE HOW MUCH TO FUND THE PROGRAM? HOW MUCH OF THAT SHOULD BE GENERAL FUND HOW MUCH THAT SHOULD BE FEE SUPPORT? WE TAKE THAT DIRECTION AND WORK WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS TO DECIDE HOW TO ALLOCATE THE FEES. BUT IT'S NOT WITHIN OUR PURVIEW TO OVERRULE THE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION LEGISLATURE'S DIRECTION AS TO HOW MUCH OF THE PROGRAM SHOULD BE COVERED BY FEES ARE SPECIAL FUND. AND HOW MUCH SHOULD BE. COVERED THUG COVERED BY GENERAL FUND. OKAY OKAY I'LL EITHER I KNOW INFLATED BY EITHER I UNDERSTAND THE GENERAL FUND THOUGH THAT OUR JOB IS THAT FROM A BUDGETARY STANDPOINT BUT IN TERMS OF FOR BUDGETING. SOMETHING EIGHT WE'RE BUDGETING A PROGRAM AND THE PROGRAM ITSELF. STAKEHOLDERS RENOWNED BOUGHT AND DEVELOPING THE PROGRAM IS THAT CORRECT. YEAH THAT'S CORRECT. THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR OF THE INFORMATION THE PRESENTATION. WILL TAKE THAT UNDER SUBMISSION. AND THE. CONSIDERATE AND FUTURE HEARING. WE HAVE JUST ONE DEPARTMENT LEFT DEPARTMENT OF FOR A TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL. WITH A. NINE I COULDN'T GO AT THAT COUNT. IF THE. GOOD MORNING GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BARBARA LEE AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL. APPEARING WITH ME TODAY IS FRANCESCA NEGRI DTS HE'S CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR. I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT TO YOU THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION PROPOSALS FOR DTS HE'S BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AS YOU KNOW DETAILS HE HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN IMPLEMENTING REFORMS AND IMPROVEMENTS IN RESPONSE TO INPUT FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. THE LEGISLATURE AND OUR STAKEHOLDERS. IN ITS FINAL REPORT DTS HE'S INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANEL RECOGNIZED OUR PROGRESS AND UNDERSCORED THE NEED FOR DTS YOU TO PERSEVERE IN THESE EFFORTS. THESE MAY REVISION PROPOSALS HAVE BEEN FOCUSED TO SUSTAIN DTS SEES PROGRESS IN CRITICAL PROGRAM AREAS THEY WILL SUPPORT DTS SEES ABILITY TO MEET ITS MISSION. TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE ENVIRONMENT FROM THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES. THE RESOURCES REQUESTED REFLECT DTS SEES COMMITMENT TO CLEAN UP CONTAMINATED SITES INCREASE ENFORCEMENT AND VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND MAXIMIZE COST RECOVERY FROM RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS BEEN WORKING WITH DTS SEE TO MAKE TOUGH CHOICES WITH LIMITED RESOURCES ON THESE PROPOSALS. IN SUMMARY DTS HE IS REQUESTING EIGHTEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS AND TWENTY NINE POSITIONS TO CONTINUE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM. SUSTAIN EFFECTIVE COST RECOVERY FUND THE STATE'S MATCH OBLIGATIONS ON NATIONAL PRIORITY LIST SITES AND CONTINUE WORK ON STATE ORPHAN CLEAN UP SITES. TO ENSURE CONTINUED PROGRESS ON THE CLOSURE OF THE EGGS I TECHNOLOGIES BATTERY RECYCLING FACILITY IN VERNON CALIFORNIA. AND THE CLEANUP OF TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES PARKS SCHOOLS AND CHILDCARE FACILITIES IN THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN HAVE THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF LEAD IN THEIR SOIL. AND THE GREATEST RISK TO SENSITIVE INDIVIDUALS AND FINALLY TO IMPLEMENT INVESTIGATION AND CLEANUP OF OTHER PROPERTIES CONTAMINATED WITH LEAD THAT THE DEPARTMENT REASONABLY SUSPECTS ORIGINATED FROM THE RECYCLING. OF LAST LEAD ACID BATTERIES. I AM PREPARED TO WALK THROUGH THE PROPOSALS FOR YOU IF YOU WOULD LIKE ON PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT COMMITMENT COMMITTEES PLAGIARIST I HAVE FILE ITEM MISTER KALRA HAS SOME QUESTIONS AND I DON'T. I I WANTED TO LEAD OFF WITH A. A QUESTION OR CONCERN REALLY ABOUT. CDVA. SOURCE OF FUNDS FOR A NUMBER OF THESE PROPOSALS I UNDERSTAND THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS. PROJECTED TO BE IN THE RED IN A COUPLE OF YEARS. AND NEEDS TO FIND OUT OF. A PERMANENT SOURCE OF FUNDING BUT IN THE MEANTIME IT LOOKS LIKE THE. LEAD ACID BATTERY FUND WHICH IS A NEWLY ESTABLISHED FUND IS IS GOING TO BE TAPPED FOR THAT PURPOSE. AND I FRANKLY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THAT. IS. APPROPRIATE GIVEN THE VERY VERY SPECIFIC LANGUAGE IN THE ENABLING LEGISLATION FOR THE FOR THE FUND. I APPRECIATE OF THE TEARS CONCERNED. I I WON UNDERSCORES I SAID IN MY OPENING REMARKS THAT A DTS HE WORKED ON WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AYE TO MAKE SOME DIFFICULT CHOICES ON THE USE OF SCARCE RESOURCES I THINK I'M HEARING THAT YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO ASK THAT QUESTION OF DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALLIED I DO THAT. YOU MISTER CHAIR JULIANA MORRISSEY ME WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WHEN WHEN WE LOOKED AT. OVERALL BUDGET FOR DTS SEE. WE WERE WE HAD OUR OVERALL APPROACH. WERE. THAT WE DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE ANY BUDGET REDUCTIONS AT THIS POINT. WE WANTED TO LIMIT PROGRAM EXPANSIONS TO THOSE PROPOSALS THAT ARE ONLY FULLY SUPPORTED BY EXISTING RESOURCES. WE ONLY WANTED TO CONSIDER FEE INCREASES WE KNOW THAT EVENTUALLY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT. BUT WE WANTED TO COME WITH A MORPH. COMPREHENSIVE I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AT AND LIKE MY QUESTION. WHICH IS. THE GOD OF LEAD ACID BATTERY FUND HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED. AS. THE RESOURCE FOR THESE SET UP VARIOU. A ISSUES. AND A. MY READING OF THE ENABLING LEGISLATION FOR THAT FUND. IS THAT IT CAN ONLY BE USED FOR SPECIFIED PURPOSES NONE OF WHICH OUR UP. APPEAR TO BE APPROPRIATE FOR OUR OTHER PROPOSED. LET LET ME ACT UP READ THE LANGUAGE. RICHARD IF THE RIGHTS OF. THE THE OF THIS IS A. ARE FROM MY AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY THREE THE. SELECT CHARMER IN THE RIGHT SECTION. I HAVE. AND I HAD IT TO EMERGING AFFECTED LA OLYMPIA AND. ASK YOU TO READ THE LANGUAGE. AND OKAY SO READING HAMMER IF. FROM TIME SECTION TWENTY FIVE TWO ONE FIVE POINT FIVE. LEAD ACID BATTERY FEES COLLECTED PURSUANT TO THIS ARTICLE SHALL BE MANAGED AS FOLLOWS. THE BIRCH AMEND AT THIS IS NUMBER ONE THE BOARD SHALL RETAIN MANY IS NECESSARY FOR THE PAYMENT OF REFUNDS REIMBURSEMENT OF THE BOARD FOR EXPENSES IN THE COLLECTION THE FEES. NUMBER TO THE REMAINING MANY SHALL BE DEPOSITED INTO THE LEAD ACID BATTERY CLEANUP FUND WHICH IS HEREBY CREATED WITHIN THE STATE TREASURY AND IT'S AVAILABLE UPON APPROPRIATION BY THE LEGISLATURE TO THE DEPARTMENT FOR THE. PURPOSES SPECIFIED THE SECTION NOWADAYS AND LET ME PICK IT UP FROM THERE IF IF IF YOU DON'T MIND THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME FIND MY PLACE HERE. SECTION. TWENTY FIVE TWO FIVE TWO ONE FIVE POINT FIVE. SUBSECTION BE ONE BOB IS VERY CLEAR BECAUSE IT SAYS. THE MONEY'S IN THE FUND SHALL BE EXPAND AT EXPENDED FOR THE FOLLOWING ACTIVITIES IT'S NOT OP AN OPTION THAT'S NOT DISCRETIONARY IT'S SHALL BE EXPANDED. AND THE A IF YOU READ SECTIONS SAYS. A BNC OF THAT SUBSECTION. A IT THE WALL ABOUT LEAD ACID BATTERY CLEANUP. AND IT'S VERY VERY SPECIFIC INVESTIGATION SITE EVALUATION CLEANUP REMEDIAL ACTION REMOVAL. BUT IT'S ALL SPECIFIC SPECIFIC AND IT SAYS SHALL IT DOESN'T REALLY GIVE ANY OF US DISCRETION TO USE IT FOR SOME OTHER PURPOSE. THERE THERE ARE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE RELATED TO THE CLEAN UP OF LEAD ACID BATTERY. EXCITED EXCITED IS IS ONE OF THE EXAM AND IT CAN BE IS FOR THOSE BUT THERE ARE OTHER PURPOSES FOR WHICH THE. A FUND IS BEING UTILIZED AND THAT'S MY CONCERN. DO. ARE YOU ABLE TO DISCUSS THAT OR I'M HAPPY THAT YOU KNOW WELL THIS IN ADVANCE WERE HOLDING THE ITEM OPEN. BUT I WANTED TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT THAT'S A. OF A CONCERN OF MINE MANAGED. THANK YOU OF MISTER KALRA FIRST AND THEN MISTER PATTERSON. I THINK IT'S CHAIR. AND END UP I. AGREE WITH THE WITH THE CONCERN IN TERMS OF THE USE OF THE FUNDS. I'M AND. YOU KNOW I I IMAGINE THAT. THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL. UP BY SUGGESTING THIS PROPOSAL YOU'RE NOT NICE THAT THE. THE THE. THERE'S NOT A SUGGESTION THAT THERE'S. THAT WE. I'M THAT ARE. WHO DID BY USING THAT THAT THESE FUNDS? FOR NON THAT CLEANUP PURPOSES ARE NOT SUGGESTING THAT WE HAVE DONE ENOUGH HARM THAT CONTAMINATION CLEANUP THERE'S STILL WORK THAT WE NEED TO DO. THAT THESE FUNDS ARE APPROPRIATELY. SO REQUIRED TO BE USED FOR. RIGHT. THAT IS CORRECT AND SO THAT'S THE CASE ARM HARD W.. REMEDIATE AT ABOUT HOW DOES THAT REMEDIATION IT FUNDED IT FOR. TAKING FUNDS THAT'S MOSBY'S Y. REMEDIATION AND USE IT FOR OTHER PURPOSES. HIGHLY SUGGEST THAT WE GET THE PROPER FUNDS TO ACTUALLY DO. WHAT? OF THE BATTERY CANNOT FIND HIS MEANT TO DO. I I I APPRECIATE YOUR QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER. ADD THE DEPARTMENT DOES HAVE A PROPOSAL AND THE LAST PROPOSAL ON YOUR LIST OF PROPOSALS TO CONSIDER THE DOES SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS. ON THE IDENTIFICATION AND A CLEANUP OF OF. SITES THAT THE DEPARTMENT REASONABLY SUSPECTS TO BE CONTAMINATED OF BY V. RECYCLING OF LEAD ACID BATTERIES. IN REGARDS TO. AT THE OTHER USES OF THE FUN AS I AS I MENTIONED EARLIER. THE DEPARTMENT. DETAILS HE DID WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO. OUR MAKE SOME TOUGH DECISIONS USING SOME LIMITED RESOURCES. THE AND SPEAK IN IN A WHO THANK YOU FOR THE ANSWER BUT IT ALSO TO SPEAKING OF THE OF OF THE MAID ANSWERS OF THEM A DAMN FUNDING. RESOURCES OF THE TOP SUBSTANCE CONTROL COUNT IS TO ANTICIPATED BEING DEFICIT NEXT TO IT THREE YEARS HOUSES DEPARTMENT OF PAYING FOR THAT BUDGET SHORTFALL. AND WHAT IS THE LIKELY PROGRAMMATIC IMPACT ON THOSE ACTIONS. AND THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN EVALUATING A AND CONDUCTING A SERIES OF ANALYSES ON ITS FUN CONDITIONS BOTH FOR THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACCOUNT. AND FOR THE HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTROL ACCOUNT. I AND WE ARE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO PUT TOGETHER SOME FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE PACKAGES. TO ADDRESS OTHERS FUNDING SHORTFALLS IN FUTURE YEARS. DOES DOES THE DEPARTMENT. OF. AS WE STAND IS APARTMENT BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN MEET ITS STATUTORILY AB REQUIRED MANDATES WITH A SMALLER BUDGET. AND IF NOT BUT RESPONSIBILITIES MOST LIKELY BE IMPACTED BY LOWER REVENUES IF. WE DON'T IDENTIFY. NEW FUNDS. YOU'RE ASKING SOME VERY POINTED QUESTIONS AND I DO APPRECIATE THE CONCERN OF THIS BODY FOR OF THE DEPARTMENT'S ONGOING PERFORMANCE. OUT. IF THE DEPARTMENT OF IS. UNABLE TO SECURE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IN FUTURE YEARS THE DEPARTMENT WILL BE OBLIGATED TO CUT SERVICES. A WE ARE EVALUATING THE SERVICES WE DO PROVIDE AYE TO ENSURE THAT THE CUTS THAT WE MAKE. A WILL HAVE THE LEAST NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS AND THE ENVIRONMENT FROM EXPOSURE TO HARMFUL TOXIC SUBSTANCES HOWEVER THERE WILL NEED TO BE CUTS THE DEPARTMENT IS CURRENTLY. AT ABOUT NINETEEN NINETY ONE STAFFING LEVELS AND. FURTHER REDUCTIONS IN THE STAFFING AT THE DEPARTMENT WILL CERTAINLY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR MISSION. BUT I AGREE WITH THAT. AND AND THINK THAT WE NEED MORE FUNDING. IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE INSPECTIONS YOU UP UP AT THE I THINK THAT. OTHER A LOT OF PRIORITIES EVEN IN A SURPLUS ENVIRONMENT FOR A LOT OF PRIORITIES AND AND CERTAINLY. IN I ONE HAS DIFFERENT IDEAS OF WHAT TO DO. WITH RESOURCES INCLUDING MAKING SURE THAT WERE COGNIZANT THAT YOU KNOW THE THE THE GLORY DAYS ON LAST FOREVER AND THAT YOU KNOW BOLSTERING OUR RESERVES WHAT HAVE YOU BUT THAT BEING SAID. UNDER OUR NEEDS I THINK THAT NOT JUST EXCITED BUT A LOT OF OTHER EXAMPLES AS TO. WHAT MORE WE SHOULD BE DOING? AND NEED TO BE DOING. I KNOW THAT. IN IN VETO MESSAGES OF TWO BILLS LAST YEAR AB TWO FORTY EIGHT MAYBE ELEVEN SEVEN NINE THE GOVERNOR. MAKE CLEAR THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON THE TASK COMPREHENSIVE DTS ERA FORMED PROTECT VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. ABOUT MEASURES OF IMMUNITIES BY THE RESPECTIVE AUTHORS IN HOPES OF SEEING ACTION ON THIS ISSUE. DOES THE ADMINISTRATION AND. MAINTAIN HIS WILLINGNESS TO ADDRESS. ISSUE THIS THIS YEAR AS ARTICULATED. OPEN IN THE PAST CERTAINLY IN THE VETO MESSAGE. I I I DO KNOW THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PUT SOME A CONSIDERABLE EFFORT INTO ADDRESSING THIS IN THE CURRENT YEAR. I'M AND I I BELIEVE WOULD BE OPEN TO FURTHER CONVERSATIONS AS APPROPRIATE. OF AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK THAT THE MY. NO MY MESSAGE CERTAINLY. THEN WHEN IT COMES TO THESE ISSUES FIRST OF ALL I DO AGREE THAT THAT. THERE'S CONCERN ABOUT. USING THE FUNDS IN THE WAY THAT I THINK ARE THE CHAIR ARTICULATED. HOWEVER EVEN BESIDES BEYOND THAT I DO THINK THAT THERE. IS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY RIGHT NOW. A TO. TARGET FUNDS AND INCREASE FUNDS IN THE WAY THAT WE HAVEN'T DONE IN RECENT YEARS. THAT. WELL WE CAN CERTAINLY IDENTIFY A VERY CLEARLY THE NEED OF A AND THE BENEFIT. OF OF ENSURING THAT THOSE FUNDS OF THEIRS ON IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE INSPECTIONS AND WHAT WE CAN DO MORE AND I THINK WE CAN DO THAT WAY THAT'S FISCALLY PRUDENT. AND EFFICIENT. BUT I DON'T THINK I AM IT'S ACCEPTABLE FOR US TO. URBAN TO OCCUR EXCEPT GOING INTO THE NEXT TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO BUDGET SHORTFALLS IN AND. DEPARTMENT THAT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT I THINK FOR THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF ALL CALIFORNIANS I THINK YOU'D AGREE. WITH THAT. OTHER ROOKIE DUES IMPORTANT THE WORK THAT WE SUPPORT IS IMPORTANT BUT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO DO MORE. AND I THINK THAT RECENT INCIDENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE FRANKLY. HAVE INDICATED THAT WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH. BUT I AYE BUT I BELIEVE THERE'S A PATH FORWARD TO ENSURE THAT WE DON'T. I'M GET TO A DEFICIT. SITUATION AND. IT IS CERTAINLY IN THE TALKS SENSES CONTROL ACCOUNT AS WELL AS WITH THE OPERATIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT WE CAN DO IT IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T. REQUIRE YOU KNOW BOB FUNDS OVER THE PLAN TO BE USING AND WAYS OTHER THAN THEIR INTENDED. AND I THINK THAT'S INCOMING UPON US AS A LEGISLATURE. AND AS WELL AS THE GOVERNOR TO MAKE SURE THOSE FUNDS ARE THERE SO THANK YOU. PATTERSON. I YEAH I JUST. ISSUE TWENTY FOUR IN FRONT OF THIS ISSUE TWENTY SEVEN IN FRONT OF US IN ISSUE THIRTY IN FRONT OF US ARE ALL DIVERSIONS FROM. FROM THE BATTERY TAX. IN THIS LOOKS LIKE. THAT FUND IS APPARENTLY AN EASY TARGET FOR DIVERSION I'M I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY. STATUTORY. OR ANY NEXUS THAT CAN BE. DEVELOPED THAT WOULD. ALLOW. BUT IT A COMPLETE. ABROGATION OF THE SPECIFIED INTENT IN THE LANGUAGE. IT WAS PASSED BY A SUPERMAJORITY VOTE. THE INTENTION AND THE RESTRICTIONS ARE VERY CLEAR. SO. ARE. THIS ISN'T JUST SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE CAN DANCE AROUND THIS IS A. BLATANT DIVERSIONARY ACTION THAT. THAT I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO. AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S BEEN PARTICULARLY. CLEAR. TESTIMONY HERE AS TO. WHERE DO YOU GET THE AUTHORITY TO DO THIS JUST BECAUSE YOU WANT TO DO IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T? AND AGAIN. AS I STATED EARLIER I DO APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS OF THE COMMITTEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON. THE DEPARTMENT IS. I DETAILS HE IS COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO MAKE A TOUGH CHOICES IN A CONSTRAINED. RESOURCE SITUATION. FINANCE ONE AN EMAIL YEAH. MEN ONLY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO. THIS I A WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE POLICY. IMPLICATIONS HERE AND. AS WITH MOST BUDGET ACTIONS THAT INVOLVE DIFFICULT TRADE OFFS. IN REGARDS TO USE. MISTER PATTERSON'S. DISCUSSION OF LEGAL AUTHORITY. WHERE THAT COMES FROM REALLY IS THE FACT THAT THE? LEAD ACID BATTERY TAX WAS ENACTED AS A TWO THIRDS. BECAUSE IT'S A TWO THIRDS THAT MEANS THAT THAT THROUGH A SUBSEQUENT LEGISLATION NINETY THE BUDGET ACT. YOU CAN THERE'S NO CONSTITUTIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON USING. WHAT'S ESSENTIALLY A TWO THIRDS OF TAX REVENUE UP FOR PURPOSES THAT DO. FIT THESE PARTICULAR ACTIVITIES AND SO WHAT WE ARE OF PROPOSING TO YOU. IS THAT. GIVEN THE FISCAL CONSTRAINTS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS THE ADMINISTRATION'S COMMITMENT TO KEEP. THE. DEPARTMENTS EXISTING PROGRAMS HOLE. THAT WE ARE ASKING THE LEGISLATURE TO USE A FINE. THAT. HAS THE ABILITY TO FUND THESE THINGS BECAUSE IT'S TWO THIRDS OF FOR THESE HIGH PRIORITY PROGRAMS SO THAT'S WHERE THE AUTHORITY COMES FROM. RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE DIFFICULT FISCAL POLICY. ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED WELL. I I DON'T WANT TO GET A NEW ALONG BACK AND FORTH WITH TO. SAY JUST SOME. I'M JUST GONNA HOLD OFF RESPONDING LA BECAUSE I WANTED DIVE INTO THE SLOW BUT DEEPER BUT I'LL DO THAT. OUTSIDE OF THE. OUTSIDE THE HEARING. HOWEVER. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO. WROTE A LETTER ON MAY TENTH THAT. ADDRESSES SOME OF THE. AND NEEDS APTLY EXCITED SITE WHICH IS ONE OF THE ITEMS IT'S ON OUR AGENDA. ON AND RAISES A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS ONE OF THOSE. IS. A DTS SEES DETERMINATION THAT. PARKWAYS WON'T BE REMEDIATED. AND I'M PARAPHRASING BECAUSE PARKWAY AREAS IN FRONT OF HOMES ARE LESS USED THAN OTHER AREAS ON THE PROPERTY. AND IT A I CAN. I HAVE TO ASSUME THAT THE REASON FOR THAT DETERMINATION HAS MORE TO DO WITH THE EXPENDITURE OF FUNDS THAN IT DOES WITH THE NEED TO CLEAN UP. EVEN THOUGH IT'S ALL A LOWER NEED SO IF WE'RE MAKING DECISIONS OF LIKE THAT TO NOT SPEND MONEY FROM THIS FUND. WHILE AT THE SAME TIME WERE MOVING MONEY OUT OF THE FUNDS FOR OTHER PURPOSES THERE TO ME SEEMS TO BE A A A DISCONNECT. SO. AND I REALIZE THIS LETTERS ONLY A BEEN OUT FOR A FEW DAYS I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE PREPARED TO RESPOND TO THE ISSUES THAT. MS CARILLO RAISES IF YOU'RE NOT THAT'S PERFECTLY. UNDERSTANDABLE AT THAT AT AT THIS POINT BUT I WOULD LIKE TO. I ASK FOR A RESPONSE TO THE ISSUES THAT ARE RAISED IN THAT MAY TENTH LETTER FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO IF NOT TODAY THEN AND. IN SHORT ORDER. COULD YOU ADDRESS THAT. AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER I ASKED SOME OF THE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR WORK. A REGARDING OTHER CLEANUP IN THE COMMUNITY AROUND ON THE EXCITED. FACILITY ON THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN. ENGAGED IN CLEAN UP ACTIVITIES THERE UP FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS NOW. WE'VE OVERSEEN THE. TESTING OF ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED PROPERTIES IN THAT COMMUNITY WE HAVE CLEANED UP OVER THREE HUNDRED PROPERTIES IN THAT COMMUNITY. YOU ARE CORRECTTHAT THE DEPARTMENT IS NOT CURRENTLY INCLUDING PARKWAYS AYE IN THE CLEANUP ACTIVITIES. ON THAT ARE OF BEING OVERSEEN AND THAT ARE. SPELLED OUT IN THE CLEANUP PLAN THAT WAS A APPROVED AND CERTIFIED A WITH ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS OF LAST YEAR. WE MADE THAT DECISION BECAUSE AS YOU HAVE OBSERVED ALL THE LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATED. A FINITE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES FOR THE DEPARTMENT. CLEAN UP OF THE UP PROPERTIES WHERE THERE IS THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF LEAD AND THE GREATEST POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO. OUR RESIDENTS ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE RESIDENTS LIVING ON THOSE PROPERTIES AND THE. THE DEPARTMENT DID AN ANALYSIS OF WHERE EXPOSURES ARE MOST LIKELY TO OCCUR. TO YOUNG CHILDREN. AND THOSE EXPOSURES ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR IN THE PLAY AREAS THAN THEY ARE IN THOSE UP PLANTED STRIPS ALONG ROADWAYS. AND SO WE HAVE MADE A DECISION THAT. IT IS THE BEST USE OF THE LIMITED FUNDS TO INSURE THAT WE CLEAN UP THOSE PLAY AREAS RATHER THAN. THE. PLANTED AREAS ALONG THE ROADWAYS WHERE CHILDREN YOUNG CHILDREN DON'T GENERALLY SPEND EXTENSIVE AMOUNTS OF TIME PLAYING IN THE DIRT. BOB IT WOULD COST AN APPROXIMATELY AN ADDITIONAL TEN PERCENT. ACT ACTUALLY THINK IT'S THIRTEEN PERCENT. FOR THE DEPARTMENT UNDERTAKE CLEANUP OF PARKWAYS. AND SO THAT WOULD BE A CORRESPONDING REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF PROPERTIES WITH PLAY AREAS THAT WOULD GET REMEDIATED WITH THESE FUNDS. IT'S A DIFFICULT CHOICE BUT OUR COMMITMENT IS ABSOLUTELY TO PROTECT THOSE VULNERABLE CHILDREN FROM THE EXPOSURE TO THE LEAD THAT WOULD HARM THEM. IS THERE A REASON WHY YOU COULDN'T ASK FOR SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING FOR THAT PURPOSE. THE DEPARTMENT IS MINDFUL THAT WE'VE BEEN ARE AWARDED BY THE LEGISLATURE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO UNDERTAKE THIS CLEANUP. OUT WE ARE DOING THIS WHILE WE ARE A OVERSEEING THE CLOSURE AND CORRECTIVE ACTION WORK OF THE EXILED FACILITY ITSELF. EXILED REMAINS RESPONSIBLE FOR NOT ONLY CLOSING ITS FACILITY SAFELY AND CLEANING UP THE CONTAMINATION. ON THE SIDE OF THE FACILITY BUT ALSO INVESTIGATING CONTAMINATION THE FACILITY MAY HAVE CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO IN THE COMMUNITIES SURROUNDING THE FACILITY. AND ENSURING THAT THAT CONTAMINATION IS ADDRESSED AS WELL. SO THE CLEAN UP THE DEPARTMENT IS UNDERTAKING RIGHT NOW IS TO ENSURE THAT THOSE PROPERTIES WITH THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF LEAD AND THE GREATEST POTENTIAL EXPOSURE. EXPOSURES TO CHIU INCENTIVE CHILDREN ARE CLEANED UP QUICKLY. WHILE WE MAKE SURE THAT EXACT CARRIES OUT THE REST OF ITS RESPONSIBILITIES SO I DO BELIEVE THAT THE PARKWAYS WILL BE FULLY ASSESSED AND ADDRESSED AS APPROPRIATE. THROUGH THE CORRECTIVE ACTION THAT EXCITE IS REQUIRED TO UNDERTAKE. THAT I'D SWIM ACT TRY UNDERSTAND SO YOU'RE YOU'RE SAYING THAT EXCITED WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR CLEANING UP THE PARKWAYS. BUT THE STATE WON'T UNDERTAKE THAT UNDER THE. A PROGRAM THAT TO ADD THAT YOUR DEPARTMENT IS LEADING. WELL WE HAVE CERTIFIED A CLEANUP PLAN. AND THAT CLEAN UP PLAN SPECIFICALLY LAYS OUT HOW WE PRIORITIZE TO THE PROPERTIES FOR CLEANUP. CONSISTENT WITH THE DIRECTION FROM THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE TO ADDRESS. THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF LEAD AND THE GREATEST POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO SENSITIVE INDIVIDUALS. THAT'S WHAT'S IN OUR CLEANUP PLAN WE'VE LAID IT OUT IT DOESN'T INCLUDE PARKWAYS. SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT US TO ADDRESS PARKWAYS WE WOULD COME BACK WITH A PROPOSAL TO DO THAT HOWEVER I WANT TO UNDERSCORE. THAT. THE EGGS I'D FACILITY THAT THE COMPANY IS RESPONSIBLE UNDER FEDERAL AND STATE LAW. FOR ENSURING THAT. THE FACILITY SITE IS APPROPRIATELY CLEANED UP AND IT'S CONTAMINATION. OFF SITE IS ALSO APPROPRIATELY CLEANED UP. A FIGHT AGAIN JUST FOR CLARIFICATION AND. I THINK MY UNDERSTANDING IS CORRECT THAT. EXCISE RESPONSIBILITY EXTENDS TO ALL OF THE WORK. INCLUDING THAT THAT'S BEING DONE UNDER THE. HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT HAS BEEN ALLOCATED BY THE LEGISLATURE THAT IS CORRECT. HAD OBVIOUSLY A LOT MORE THAT WE COULD BE A A DIVING INTO THE TO THIS ISSUE MISTER PATTERSON DID YOU HAVE IN A QUICKLY I'M I HAVEN'T ADJOURNMENTS ART. AND WHAT A PUBLIC ON THAT TO READ. THAT'S. ONE O'CLOCK IT'S PRESSING ME BUT AGAIN I'M MENTION WE HAVE THREE ISSUES THAT YOU'VE BROUGHT FORWARD ALL THREE OF THESE. ARE SIGNIFICANT DIVERSIONS AND I WOULD HOPE THAT. THE. CONSENSUS OF THIS COMMITTEE WOULD BE NOT TO PASS THIS THROUGH AND TO REITERATE. AS FORCEFULLY AS WE CAN AND THAT THE INTENTION FOR THE BATTERY TAX WAS TO DO PRECISELY WHAT THE LEGISLATION CALLED FOREIGN. AND. IT JUST GONNA HAVE TO SEEK SOME OTHER WAYS OF FUNDING. THAT WOULD BE OUR I HOPE AND AN OUTCOME THAT WE COULD AGREE ON THAT SIR THANK YOU OF. PUBLIC COMMENT. NOT IN ADDRESSING WITH THE SAN ANDREAS POVERTY IN THE ENVIRONMENT. AND I PULLED OUT A COUPLE OF QUOTES FROM THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANELS AYE LAST REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE. AYE DTS HE'S ACCOUNTS ARE ONCE AGAIN IN STRUCTURAL DEFICIT WITH DEPLETED RESERVES. THIS PROBLEM IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE BASED ON PROJECTED REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES. IT REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ATTENTION FROM THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE. BEGINNING TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET. AND I CONTINUE TO BE VERY CONCERNED. THAT WE ARE PASSING THE BUCK YEAR BY YEAR LAST YEAR I SEND FRONT OF THIS COMMITTEE. ARMED WITH A PLEA OF PROVIDING MORE MONEY FOR ORPHANS SITES. LAST YEAR DETAILS HE WAS NOT ABLE TO COVER ALL OF ITS EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH ORPHAN SITES. I AND HAD AUGMENT ITS BUDGET FROM OTHER AGENCIES. AND THIS YEAR THERE ARE TAKING MONEY FROM THE BATTERY FEE FOR PURPOSE IT IS NOT INTENDED TO PAY FOR. IF WE DON'T TAKE A SERIOUS LOOK. AB HOW TO PERMANENTLY AND SUSTAINABLY FIGURE OUT HOW TO FUND THE TSC AT AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL SO THAT ALL ORPHANS AS CAN BE PAID FOR THAT THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS. PROGRAM CAN BE PAID FOR FOR THAT ENVIRONMENTAL ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM CAN BE PAID FOR WE'RE GOING TO KEEP COMING BACK YEAR AFTER YEAR. I. AND I COMMUNITIES ARE GOING TO SUFFER SO IT PAINS ME TO SAY THAT I DO NOT THINK THESE ARE APPROPRIATE EXPENDITURES FROM THE BATTERY FIND. WHAT I DO THINK IS THAT WE NEED TO FOLLOW THE ADVICE OF THE AYE APPEAL ALSO SAYS? IF DTC DOES NOT HAVE APPROPRIATE RESOURCES TO EXECUTE ITS MANDATES THE HEALTH CALIFORNIANS IN THE STATE'S ENVIRONMENT WILL SUFFER. TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY AT THAT COMPARTMENT SHOULD BE IMPORTANT PRIORITIES FOR THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE THEIR NECESSARY TO PROVIDE ASSURANCES THAT RESOURCE ALLOCATIONS HAVE BEEN GOOD INVESTMENTS. WE CONTINUE TO ASK. THAT THERE BE SOME ACCOUNTABILITY STRUCTURES AT DTS HE TO ENSURE THAT WE DO NOT HAVE THE STRUCTURAL DEFICITS AND THAT WE HAVE A BODY THAT IS TASKED WITH LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN MAKE SURE. THE DTS USE SOLVENT AND THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIANS ARE ACTED. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON ANGELA BELOW MO DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR HEALTH PROTECTION FOR LA COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. I I COULDN'T AGREE MORE MISTER CHAIR WITH THE COMMENTS THAT YOU AND THE OTHER MEMBERS HAD RAISED ABOUT THE INAPPROPRIATE UP PROPOSED USE OF THE BATTERY FEE. YOU KNOW I THINK THAT IN ADDITION WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE NEED WITHIN. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO ADDRESS BATTERY CONTAMINATED LAND. IT'S A NEED THAT WE WILL NEVER QUITE HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO TO WHAT COMPLETELY ADDRESS. AND SO THIS IS AN AREA WHERE THE NEED IS EXTREME. AND I KNOW THAT WHEN THIS BATTERY BE FEE WAS PROPOSED. THE ADVOCATES AND AUTHORS OF THE BILL INTENDED EXACTLY THE WAY THAT THE MEMBERS HAVE JUST EXPRESSED. AND FOR US TO DIVERT THAT MONEY INTO OTHER PURPOSES CONSUMER PRODUCTS IS IMPORTANT IS THAT IS. WOULD BE. BASICALLY DENYING THAT EXTREMELY THAT WE'VE GOT IN THE PUBLIC NOT RIGHT NOW FOR ADDRESSING THIS TYPE OF LEAD CONTAMINATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU I'M A DIRECTOR LEE WE KINDA JUMPED AROUND TO US THROUGH A. A YEAR AGENDA ITEMS. AND SO I WANT TO GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY IF CLAIRE I I THINK WE. MORE LESS COVERED EVERYTHING BUT THE IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU WANT TO ADD TO ANY OF THOSE ITEMS WHO WANT TO GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT SINCE WE. DIDN'T QUITE FOLLOW THE SAME FORMAT FOR YOU THAT WE DID FOR. OF THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY I'M I I AM MERELY PREPARED TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ON THE SPECIFIC ITEMS I GAVE YOU ARE. A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE WERE SOME SOME BIG ISSUES YOU WANTED TO DISCUSS SO I APPRECIATE THAT THING THAT I THINK OF BEST ENOUGH QUESTIONS SIR. FOR TODAY. AND OF A CERTAIN LEGAL HAFTA. SOME ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS TO BE ADDRESSED TO A. THAT WE CAN DO OUTSIDE OF THEM OF THE MEETING IN PREPARATION FOR. ART ROCK AND FINAL. REVIEW LITTLE BECAUSE UP COMING IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS. I STRONGLY DID YOU ON ANYTHING GUY ALEJO. SORE MAKE SURE EVERYBODY'S HAD THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE US THE FEEDBACK CA THAT THEY'RE WAITING FOR ANSWERS I THINK THERE'S A ROBUST DISCUSSION ABOUT MAIN ISSUES WHO WISHES. TO RAISE I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT TWO THINGS ON THAT COST RECOVERY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATIVE MODIFY THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSED PROVISIONAL BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE. TO INCLUDE AT. THIRTY GET NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENT. AND THEN ON THE LEAD ACID BATTERY PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION. UP THERE WAS A REPORT OUTSTANDING TO READ REJECTED DATE ARE WOULD RECOMMENDED THE YOU REJECT THE PROPOSAL HOWEVER YESTERDAY WE RECEIVED THE REPORT SOBRE WITHDRAWN THAT RECOMMENDATION. ALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IF THERE'S NOTHING FURTHER THAN. WE'VE WE'VE ALREADY CLOSED UP PUBLIC COMMENT I KNOW I APOLOGIZE MISTER CHAIR BUT I FORGOT TO COMMENT ON ONE OF THE ITEMS THAT I THOUGHT WAS GONNA COME SUBSEQUENT IN HOT SUNNY DAY REAL AUTONOMOUS AGENT THERE. THANK YOU. IF THERE'S ANYONE WHO WANT TO SPEAK ON ANY OF THE ITEMS. UNDER UNDER THE SET TOPIC. NOW WOULD BE THE TIME SO PLEASE THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN JUST A VERY QUICK COMMENT ON THE. REAPPROPRIATION OF THE HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX POINT FIVE MILLION FOR THE EXITE CLEAN UP. ARE I WE CERTAINLY BELIEVE IN SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL. AND WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THAT MONEY SHOULD DO A COMPLETE CLEAN UP WHICH WOULD INCLUDE ADDRESSING BOTH THE PARKWAYS. THE YARDS AND THE HOME INTERIORS THIS IS VITAL IF WE'RE GONNA. LEAVE RESIDENTS WITH THE FEELING THAT THEIR PROPERTIES HAVE BEEN CLEANED UP WE REALLY HAVE TO BE IN A POSITION TO TELL THEM. THAT THEY'RE NO LONGER. ARE THEY NO LONGER HAVE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT LEAD IN THEIR HOME. AND THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT IS TO ADDRESS ALL THREE OF THOSE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU AND THAT BRINGS US TO THE CONCLUSION OF A VERY. INTERESTING LENGTHY. OF THAT IMPORTANT TO A PUBLIC HEARING SO I THINK YOU OFFER YOUR PRETTY THE PATIENT. WORDS ARENT
