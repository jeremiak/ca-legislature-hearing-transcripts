00:51:17.774 --> 00:51:19.876
AN IN A SPORTS COMPETITION THAT

00:51:19.943 --> 00:51:22.045
HAPPENS A LOT. WITH THE SYSTEM

VICTORY IT'S NOW A SCAM OR A

00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:36.259

LGBTQ KIDS WHO WERE REJECTED BY

00:59:53.289 --> 00:59:56.859
MEAN IT WAS AMAZING THERE WAS-

00:59:56.926 --> 00:59:58.962
ONE OF THE PEOPLE INTERACTING ON

00:59:59.028 --> 01:00:00.930
HER TWITTER ACCOUNT DESCRIBES

01:00:00.997 --> 01:00:04.100
HOW HE WATCHED JEOPARDY WITH HIS

01:00:04.167 --> 01:00:06.803
GRANDFATHER AND HIS GRANDFATHER

01:00:06.869 --> 01:00:09.138
WAS AT INFIRM BUT HIS

01:00:09.205 --> 01:00:11.007
GRANDFATHER HAD ALWAYS BEEN VERY

01:00:11.074 --> 01:00:13.576
PREJUDICED. TOWARDS ALL LGBTQ

01:00:13.643 --> 01:00:16.879
PEOPLE AND THIS REALLY HURTS THE

01:00:16.946 --> 01:00:18.047
YOUNG MAN WHO WOULD WATCH

01:00:18.114 --> 01:00:19.849
JEOPARDY WITH HIS GRANDFATHER.

01:00:19.916 --> 01:00:21.718
BUT AS HIS GRANDFATHER OBSERVED

01:00:21.784 --> 01:00:24.754
AMY SCHNEIDER AND WOULD TALK TO

01:00:24.821 --> 01:00:26.622
HIS GRANDSON ABOUT. HE CONCLUDED

01:00:26.689 --> 01:00:28.758
THAT WELL YOU KNOW. MAYBE IT'S

01:00:28.825 --> 01:00:33.496
NOT SO. ODD OR MAYBE I MAYBE

01:00:33.563 --> 01:00:35.665
IT'S REALLY OKAY THIS WEEK

01:00:35.732 --> 01:00:37.500
COMPLETELY THE GRANDFATHER

01:00:37.567 --> 01:00:39.836
COMPLETELY CHANGED HIS MIND AND

01:00:39.902 --> 01:00:41.971
OPENED HIS HEART TO TRANSCEND

01:00:42.038 --> 01:00:45.041
LGBTQ PEOPLE FROM WATCHING

01:00:45.108 --> 01:00:48.311
JEOPARDY. AB SCHNEIDER HERSELF

01:00:48.378 --> 01:00:50.646
TALKED ABOUT THAT REALLY THE

01:00:50.713 --> 01:00:53.149
BIGGEST IMPACT OF HER EING ON

01:00:53.216 --> 01:00:55.918
JEOPARDY WAS CREATING THAT

01:00:55.985 --> 01:00:59.288
VISIBILITY AND NOT AWARENESS AND

01:00:59.355 --> 01:01:01.224
ACCEPTANCE FOR TRANS PEOPLE. SO

01:01:01.290 --> 01:01:03.259
