broadband to be sufficient

00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:15.026
affordable and accessible would

00:33:15.093 --> 00:33:16.027
also require the California

presumption for the state

00:33:33.511 --> 00:33:34.912
based on a reasonable timeline

00:33:35.713 --> 00:33:37.315
covered nineteen highlighted

00:33:37.382 --> 00:33:39.150
how wide the digital divide is

00:33:39.217 --> 00:33:41.252
in California and how crucial

00:33:41.486 --> 00:33:42.754
broadband infrastructure has

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:44.689
become to modern life we saw

00:33:44.756 --> 00:33:45.757
working class families in

both urban and rural counties

00:33:48.025 --> 00:33:49.894
struggle with having their

00:33:51.529 --> 00:33:53.064
of a lack of affordable and

reliable internet services

00:33:55.767 --> 00:33:56.868

reliable and affordable high

00:33:58.102 --> 00:33:59.570
speed internet is becoming

a necessity in today's day

00:34:01.038 --> 00:34:03.374
and age AB twenty seven fifty

00:34:03.441 --> 00:34:04.842
three will make broadband more

00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:07.044
affordable and reliable by

00:34:07.111 --> 00:34:08.513
first establishing the policy

the broadband technologies

00:34:34.772 --> 00:34:36.240
and services are the defining

00:34:36.307 --> 00:34:38.443
trait of the digital age well

00:34:38.509 --> 00:34:40.011
the Legislature has supported

00:34:40.077 --> 00:34:41.579
projects that are critical

00:34:41.646 --> 00:34:42.747
to bridging the bridging the

00:34:42.814 --> 00:34:44.582
digital divide the state needs

00:34:44.649 --> 00:34:45.750
to ensure the beyond these

00:34:45.817 --> 00:34:47.952
investments Californians have

in the work that your staff is

off and bring clarity to the

00:35:54.752 --> 00:35:56.954
issue I don't know if it's

00:35:57.021 --> 00:35:58.923
at this point in time for me

00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:00.358
to maybe address some of the

00:36:00.758 --> 00:36:02.393
concerns from the opposition

00:36:02.693 --> 00:36:05.363
-- which have outlined

00:36:05.429 --> 00:36:07.532
them in the letter to you all

00:36:07.765 --> 00:36:10.401
if it is appropriate or if

00:36:11.402 --> 00:36:13.137
not we can wait till they

00:36:13.204 --> 00:36:15.273

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:17.141
ourselves get directions from

00:36:17.208 --> 00:36:18.809
the chair it's entirely up to

00:36:18.876 --> 00:36:20.811
you thank you Mr chairman I'll

00:36:20.878 --> 00:36:23.147
take the opportunity -- the

00:36:23.214 --> 00:36:24.715
letter that has been provided

00:36:24.782 --> 00:36:26.884
in opposition House states

00:36:27.418 --> 00:36:28.953
that -- they are strongly in

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:31.122
support of the goal however

00:36:31.188 --> 00:36:33.257
-- for whatever reason they

00:36:33.324 --> 00:36:35.026
cite them they think that --

00:36:35.092 --> 00:36:37.261
this is not a position that

00:36:37.328 --> 00:36:40.665
they can support historically

00:36:40.731 --> 00:36:42.500
members you should be aware

00:36:42.567 --> 00:36:45.002
that the digital divide a

00:36:45.069 --> 00:36:46.771
debate and broadband debate

00:36:47.004 --> 00:36:49.140
has historically had opposition

00:36:49.206 --> 00:36:51.375
from this association it

00:36:51.442 --> 00:36:52.743
did not support the internet

00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:55.246
for all built in AB

00:36:55.313 --> 00:36:57.315
sixty sixty five which was the

00:36:57.381 --> 00:37:00.051
basis that -- allowed for

00:37:00.351 --> 00:37:03.020
-- additional legislation

00:37:03.087 --> 00:37:05.623
to be able to come forth

00:37:05.923 --> 00:37:06.958
are they are not supporting

00:37:07.024 --> 00:37:09.527
the public housing account

00:37:09.594 --> 00:37:12.163
in the Advanced Services

00:37:12.363 --> 00:37:14.699
Fund -- they did not support it

00:37:14.765 --> 00:37:16.934
last year -- this is money that

00:37:17.001 --> 00:37:19.537
can and should and is necessary

00:37:19.604 --> 00:37:21.806
to be used in our public housing

00:37:22.039 --> 00:37:24.308
complexes these are complexes

00:37:24.375 --> 00:37:27.111
that engage senior housing

00:37:27.378 --> 00:37:29.447
and other types of government

00:37:29.647 --> 00:37:30.815
housing including farm

00:37:30.881 --> 00:37:32.550
worker housing their history

00:37:32.617 --> 00:37:33.651
shows that they have been

00:37:33.718 --> 00:37:35.486
on record not supporting the

00:37:35.553 --> 00:37:38.489
affordable internet -- net

00:37:38.856 --> 00:37:41.626
equality act and so I want

00:37:41.692 --> 00:37:44.562
to leave just the message

00:37:44.629 --> 00:37:47.398
that although the V.

00:37:55.272 --> 00:37:56.641
let me let me let me rephrase

00:37:56.707 --> 00:37:59.176
this -- I believe

00:37:59.243 --> 00:38:00.645
that the cable industry has

00:38:00.711 --> 00:38:03.280
a place and is a stakeholder

00:38:03.948 --> 00:38:05.483
however we are facing

00:38:06.651 --> 00:38:09.420
incredible disproportionate

00:38:09.487 --> 00:38:11.656
impacts in our local communities

00:38:11.722 --> 00:38:13.557
be they rural or urban

00:38:14.425 --> 00:38:16.193
the data is apple

00:38:17.228 --> 00:38:19.530
whether it's Q. research

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:21.699
whether it's research coming

00:38:21.766 --> 00:38:24.035
from universities the data is

00:38:24.101 --> 00:38:26.704
very clear that there is

00:38:26.771 --> 00:38:29.874
a red line anti

00:38:31.075 --> 00:38:33.811
broadband delivery deployment

00:38:34.111 --> 00:38:36.147
that we need to deal with it

00:38:36.213 --> 00:38:38.449
from a public perspective and

00:38:38.516 --> 00:38:39.984
-- this particular bill is a

00:38:40.051 --> 00:38:42.153
bill that allows for recourse

00:38:42.486 --> 00:38:44.889
if and when there is

00:38:45.189 --> 00:38:48.325
-- documentation

00:38:48.392 --> 00:38:50.194
and evidence and it is not

00:38:50.494 --> 00:38:52.229
uncommon for this legislature

00:38:52.296 --> 00:38:53.864
in this body to respond

00:38:54.331 --> 00:38:55.633
it did with the California

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:57.435
voting rights act it did

00:38:57.501 --> 00:38:58.736
with the farmworkers act

00:38:58.803 --> 00:39:00.604
to protect farmworkers and

00:39:00.671 --> 00:39:02.139
we are asking that it also

00:39:02.206 --> 00:39:04.975
be -- with this particular

00:39:05.042 --> 00:39:06.477
bill be brought forth to

00:39:06.544 --> 00:39:09.146
protect and enhance reliable

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:12.650
affordable high speed internet

00:39:12.717 --> 00:39:14.618
Ste in the underserved

00:39:15.086 --> 00:39:16.587

00:39:18.055 --> 00:39:19.423

warning Mister chair members

00:40:53.784 --> 00:40:54.819
Bernie Roscoe with a California

00:40:54.885 --> 00:40:55.920
cable and telecommunications

00:40:55.986 --> 00:40:57.788

some Umbridge with her your

00:41:04.562 --> 00:41:06.897
comments so the challenge

00:41:06.964 --> 00:41:08.365
for broadband and the latest

00:41:08.432 --> 00:41:09.433
California Advanced Services

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:10.835
Fund report just came out

00:41:10.901 --> 00:41:12.703
just last week and so of the

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:13.904
thirteen point three million

00:41:13.971 --> 00:41:15.239
households in California

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:17.441
approximately five three hundred

00:41:17.508 --> 00:41:18.809
fifty thousand households do

00:41:18.876 --> 00:41:20.277
not have any access whatsoever

00:41:20.344 --> 00:41:22.046
to broadband so so that's

00:41:22.112 --> 00:41:23.147
that's a challenge there to

00:41:23.214 --> 00:41:25.683
build facilities there to

00:41:26.383 --> 00:41:28.085
the household to have access

00:41:28.152 --> 00:41:29.286
ninety seven point two percent

00:41:29.353 --> 00:41:30.154
of California households

00:41:30.221 --> 00:41:31.388
have access to twenty five in

00:41:31.455 --> 00:41:34.158
three broadband today but

00:41:34.225 --> 00:41:35.426
approximately two million

00:41:35.492 --> 00:41:37.461
households that could sign up

00:41:37.528 --> 00:41:38.696
for broadband service do not

00:41:38.762 --> 00:41:39.964
sign up so this is the latest

00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:41.265
California vents Services Fund

00:41:41.332 --> 00:41:42.600
report from the public utilities

00:41:42.666 --> 00:41:43.367
commission these are their

00:41:43.434 --> 00:41:45.870
numbers not ours no one has done

00:41:45.936 --> 00:41:47.938
more for broadband deployment

00:41:48.005 --> 00:41:49.106
and adoption I think in the

00:41:49.173 --> 00:41:50.608
cable industry and I challenge

00:41:50.674 --> 00:41:52.643
everyone to that to that comment

00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:54.044
the ninety seven point two

00:41:54.111 --> 00:41:55.279
percent broadband deployment

00:41:55.346 --> 00:41:57.114
in the state is based all on

00:41:57.181 --> 00:41:58.716
private investment the cable

00:41:58.782 --> 00:42:00.584
industry until more recently has

00:42:00.651 --> 00:42:01.819
never really taken a dime from

00:42:01.886 --> 00:42:04.455
government to do that so to

00:42:04.521 --> 00:42:06.290
the bill we are very supportive

00:42:06.357 --> 00:42:07.625
of broadband equity we support

00:42:07.691 --> 00:42:08.792
private equity we have been

00:42:08.859 --> 00:42:10.728
doing private equity firm

00:42:11.128 --> 00:42:12.930
since we have been deploying

00:42:12.997 --> 00:42:15.065
broadband so the question for

00:42:15.132 --> 00:42:16.166
the committee though is is this

00:42:16.233 --> 00:42:18.302
the best approach is the best

00:42:18.769 --> 00:42:20.304
way to meet that challenge to

00:42:20.371 --> 00:42:21.772
ensure that those who do not

00:42:21.839 --> 00:42:23.574
have broadband have not adopted

00:42:23.641 --> 00:42:25.175
or do not have access to it is

00:42:25.242 --> 00:42:27.177
this the best way to do it and

00:42:27.244 --> 00:42:28.545
and I would say not I would

00:42:28.612 --> 00:42:29.413
say the best thing we need to

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:30.614
do and it's in our letter that

00:42:30.681 --> 00:42:31.548
we share with the committee

00:42:31.916 --> 00:42:33.050
is to have a partnership with

00:42:33.117 --> 00:42:35.085
the federal government to have

00:42:35.352 --> 00:42:37.187
their adoption programs or

00:42:37.254 --> 00:42:38.856
deployment dollars match up

00:42:38.923 --> 00:42:39.957
with the plans of the cable

00:42:40.024 --> 00:42:41.892
industry and the telco industry

00:42:42.192 --> 00:42:43.227
and that would be a far better

00:42:43.294 --> 00:42:45.129
reports our approach to the

00:42:45.195 --> 00:42:47.231
issue of redlining there have

00:42:47.298 --> 00:42:48.766
been no conclusive studies that

00:42:48.832 --> 00:42:50.067
show that the cable industry

00:42:50.134 --> 00:42:51.902
or a telco industry redline

00:42:51.969 --> 00:42:52.970
so that starting off with that

00:42:53.037 --> 00:42:55.739
very premise is --

00:42:55.806 --> 00:42:58.742
sort of -- upsetting so

00:42:59.543 --> 00:43:01.245
I would say I would love to

00:43:01.312 --> 00:43:02.613
see the studies that show

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:03.747
that there is redlining there

00:43:03.814 --> 00:43:05.316
are challenges to broadband

00:43:05.382 --> 00:43:07.551
deployment -- in some cases

00:43:07.618 --> 00:43:08.752
in public housing we're not

00:43:08.819 --> 00:43:10.254
allowed access government owns

00:43:10.321 --> 00:43:12.356
those buildings -- years ago

00:43:12.423 --> 00:43:13.390
when they built those buildings

00:43:13.457 --> 00:43:14.692
they didn't want to support the

00:43:14.758 --> 00:43:16.026
infrastructure to go into those

00:43:16.093 --> 00:43:19.263
facilities I thank the senator

00:43:19.596 --> 00:43:20.965
Bradford then something that

00:43:21.031 --> 00:43:22.199
Bradford was upset Nickerson

00:43:22.266 --> 00:43:23.567
gardens in Los Angeles couldn't

00:43:23.634 --> 00:43:24.868
have broadband access because

00:43:24.935 --> 00:43:26.770
we couldn't get in there so we

00:43:26.837 --> 00:43:28.706
support legislation last year

00:43:29.006 --> 00:43:31.175
by a senator Bradford to help

00:43:31.241 --> 00:43:32.910
deploy broadband adoption

00:43:32.977 --> 00:43:35.579
literacy and access to public

00:43:35.646 --> 00:43:37.047
housing units we did a bill

00:43:37.114 --> 00:43:39.616
with cinnamon daily to insure

00:43:39.683 --> 00:43:40.985
that low income households

00:43:41.051 --> 00:43:42.987
students to get broadband access

00:43:44.021 --> 00:43:45.055
The Daily bill was vetoed by

00:43:45.122 --> 00:43:46.056
the governor he thought he's

00:43:46.123 --> 00:43:47.891
has done enough for K. twelve

00:43:47.958 --> 00:43:49.827
students and -- Bradford

00:43:49.893 --> 00:43:50.828
bill was held in the Assembly

00:43:50.894 --> 00:43:52.596
Appropriations Committee so we

00:43:52.663 --> 00:43:54.832
are working very hard to to get

00:43:54.898 --> 00:43:57.568
adoption to get deployments --

00:43:57.634 --> 00:43:58.902
hi are only questions for the

00:43:58.969 --> 00:44:00.337
committee is I think this is

00:44:00.404 --> 00:44:01.472
this proposal should be more

00:44:01.538 --> 00:44:03.607
of a policy that's backed up

00:44:03.674 --> 00:44:05.042
by actions either budgetary

00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:06.643
earlier legislatively or from

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:08.212
the administration you had six

00:44:08.278 --> 00:44:09.446
billion dollars adopted last

00:44:09.513 --> 00:44:11.382
year not not a single penny

00:44:11.448 --> 00:44:14.418
went to an adoption program --

00:44:14.485 --> 00:44:16.086
it's permissive it's in there

00:44:16.153 --> 00:44:18.422
it's -- but it's not explicit

00:44:18.489 --> 00:44:19.990
it wasn't explicitly adopted

00:44:20.057 --> 00:44:21.792
and your legislative plan of

00:44:21.859 --> 00:44:23.127
the six billion dollars to save

00:44:23.193 --> 00:44:25.062
this much money should go to

00:44:25.129 --> 00:44:27.531
adoption so anyway -- for all

00:44:27.598 --> 00:44:28.599
those reasons you just got me

00:44:28.665 --> 00:44:29.566
got me all worked up center

00:44:29.633 --> 00:44:31.735
parking so you yeah you got

00:44:31.802 --> 00:44:33.370
me flustered and that's okay

00:44:33.604 --> 00:44:35.005
all I will say is that we are

00:44:35.072 --> 00:44:36.440
supportive of digital equity

00:44:37.307 --> 00:44:39.276
our only question is we are not

00:44:39.343 --> 00:44:41.045
supportive of this approach we

00:44:41.111 --> 00:44:42.913
would -- we would love to work

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:43.981
with the S. a Mormon we've had

00:44:44.048 --> 00:44:45.149

in the future but for now we are

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:50.354

00:46:01.458 --> 00:46:03.026
committee questions comments

00:46:03.093 --> 00:46:05.429
was Kalra I did get my coffee

00:46:05.496 --> 00:46:06.563
this morning of the needed

00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:08.799
amount I'm awake now --

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:11.101
as well as when I think you

00:46:11.168 --> 00:46:12.369
ought to bring this for you know

00:46:12.436 --> 00:46:14.271
I I represent City sounds at the

00:46:14.338 --> 00:46:15.772
capitol so can Valley and yet

00:46:16.106 --> 00:46:17.875
other far too many of families

00:46:17.941 --> 00:46:19.409
far too many children that

00:46:19.476 --> 00:46:21.345
don't have access to internet

00:46:21.411 --> 00:46:22.779
all that on high speed internet

00:46:22.846 --> 00:46:24.915
and so I think this problem is

00:46:24.982 --> 00:46:26.350
pervasive whether you're in a

00:46:26.416 --> 00:46:28.051
rural community urban community

00:46:28.519 --> 00:46:29.920
-- and it is something that we

00:46:29.987 --> 00:46:31.388
just have to make a very clear

00:46:31.622 --> 00:46:33.891
statement on that that holds our

00:46:33.957 --> 00:46:35.859
feet to the fire -- and I think

00:46:35.926 --> 00:46:38.162
industry -- you know how to be

00:46:38.228 --> 00:46:39.863
part of the solution I think

00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:40.597
that we're gonna have to put

00:46:40.664 --> 00:46:41.865
resources into it there's gonna

00:46:41.932 --> 00:46:42.900
be a lot of it would have to put

00:46:42.966 --> 00:46:45.335
policy to back it up but you

00:46:45.402 --> 00:46:46.570
have to start with making this

00:46:46.637 --> 00:46:48.972
very clear -- the statement

00:46:49.039 --> 00:46:50.107
and I think with this of the

00:46:50.174 --> 00:46:51.708
bill of rights it does that

00:46:51.775 --> 00:46:53.710
and I think because it puts

00:46:53.777 --> 00:46:55.245
the responsibility on us in the

00:46:55.312 --> 00:46:57.347
years ahead -- meant to move to

00:46:57.414 --> 00:46:59.016
follow through on it and so I I

00:46:59.082 --> 00:47:00.317
appreciate this bill coming four

00:47:00.384 --> 00:47:01.084
look for to working with the

00:47:01.151 --> 00:47:03.420
other on the thank you for the

00:47:03.487 --> 00:47:06.156
comments all right thank you

00:47:07.191 --> 00:47:08.192
this Reyes for bringing this

00:47:08.258 --> 00:47:10.194
forward and for those of us have

00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:11.228
been working in this space for a

00:47:11.295 --> 00:47:13.230
long time thank coming providers

00:47:13.297 --> 00:47:14.765
of fought us tooth and nail

00:47:15.065 --> 00:47:17.301
every step of the way

00:47:17.734 --> 00:47:20.270
and they used to cystic six

00:47:21.838 --> 00:47:23.440
very cleverly but the fact

00:47:23.507 --> 00:47:25.742
is is that geographically we

00:47:25.809 --> 00:47:27.411
don't really have appropriate

00:47:28.679 --> 00:47:30.047
penetration of potentially

00:47:30.113 --> 00:47:31.515
broadband in every place in

00:47:31.582 --> 00:47:33.951
California and this sort

00:47:34.017 --> 00:47:35.485
of archaic notion of twenty

00:47:35.552 --> 00:47:37.187
five and three is absolutely

00:47:37.254 --> 00:47:38.455
ridiculous and they hold on

00:47:38.522 --> 00:47:39.957
to that and because that's a

00:47:40.023 --> 00:47:42.993
pricing model it is pricing

00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:45.429
people out of the band with

00:47:45.495 --> 00:47:46.897
that they actually need on a

00:47:46.964 --> 00:47:48.165
day to day basis we need to

00:47:48.232 --> 00:47:50.033
get to symmetrical and we need

00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:51.935
a lot more capacity because

00:47:52.002 --> 00:47:53.170
when folks are conducting

00:47:53.237 --> 00:47:55.739
business or school operations or

00:47:55.806 --> 00:47:58.775
others they need that capacity

00:47:58.842 --> 00:48:00.077
given the state of where the

00:48:00.143 --> 00:48:03.180
electronics are today so I eight

00:48:05.449 --> 00:48:07.150
this is always interesting when

00:48:07.217 --> 00:48:09.386
the incoming providers come in

00:48:09.453 --> 00:48:11.521
and are really trying to block

00:48:11.588 --> 00:48:13.957
efforts to provide broadband

00:48:14.024 --> 00:48:15.459
services in a lot of areas I I

00:48:15.525 --> 00:48:17.261
have a community where we have

00:48:17.327 --> 00:48:18.595
in common provider for about

00:48:18.662 --> 00:48:20.163
half of what is effectively

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:22.266
a school district had outside

00:48:22.332 --> 00:48:24.234
of where that provider has

00:48:24.301 --> 00:48:27.170
decided to invest about

00:48:27.237 --> 00:48:28.739
half of those kids a lot of

00:48:28.805 --> 00:48:30.107
the more we see in the images

00:48:30.173 --> 00:48:31.975
of kids going to Taco Bell to

00:48:32.042 --> 00:48:34.044
get broadband well nobody's

00:48:34.111 --> 00:48:35.045
report of these kids because

00:48:35.112 --> 00:48:36.313
they're not sitting in a public

00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:37.814
place there's the and or in a

00:48:37.881 --> 00:48:39.583
visible place like a fast food

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:42.352
outlet there sitting outside the

00:48:42.419 --> 00:48:43.754
school classroom Friday evening

00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:45.355
Saturdays and Sundays in order

00:48:45.422 --> 00:48:46.456
to check is the only place that

00:48:46.523 --> 00:48:48.091
they can get adequate coverage

00:48:48.458 --> 00:48:50.527
for broadband and the income

00:48:50.594 --> 00:48:52.296
a providers have blocked every

00:48:52.362 --> 00:48:54.698
single move every single move to

00:48:54.765 --> 00:48:57.501
try and have others provide

00:48:57.567 --> 00:49:00.337
that service out there so they

00:49:01.138 --> 00:49:02.873
the providers cannot sit there

00:49:02.939 --> 00:49:04.141
and say we've we're doing

00:49:04.207 --> 00:49:05.709
everything when in fact they've

00:49:05.776 --> 00:49:07.878
been for years blocking a lot

00:49:07.944 --> 00:49:09.613
of these efforts to to truly get

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:11.515
broadband where it's needed the

00:49:11.581 --> 00:49:13.984
most and so I appreciate your

00:49:15.252 --> 00:49:17.187
efforts here -- it enjoys an

00:49:17.254 --> 00:49:18.555
aye vote we will certainly

00:49:18.622 --> 00:49:20.357
take a motion once we get a

00:49:20.424 --> 00:49:22.526
quorum but I I appreciate your

00:49:22.592 --> 00:49:24.227
efforts here about -- Majority

00:49:24.294 --> 00:49:25.862
Leader with that human clones

00:49:26.463 --> 00:49:27.531
thank you and I think that

00:49:27.597 --> 00:49:29.299
-- center and I were talking

00:49:29.366 --> 00:49:31.234
about the fact that there have

00:49:31.301 --> 00:49:32.369
been lots of challenges in the

00:49:32.436 --> 00:49:34.538
past but now there has been

00:49:34.838 --> 00:49:36.540
billions of dollars invested

00:49:36.873 --> 00:49:38.809
and now we have no excuse we've

00:49:38.875 --> 00:49:40.477
to many children and too many

00:49:40.811 --> 00:49:42.646
-- marginalized communities

00:49:42.713 --> 00:49:44.114
without broadband without

00:49:44.181 --> 00:49:46.483
reliable broadband and they

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:49.353
deserve to have it and this bill

00:49:49.419 --> 00:49:51.188
tells us that this tells them

00:49:51.254 --> 00:49:52.255
that the state of California

00:49:52.322 --> 00:49:53.690
is committed to them and with

00:49:53.757 --> 00:49:54.991
that when we have a quorum I

00:49:55.058 --> 00:49:56.526
respectfully ask for an aye vote

00:49:56.593 --> 00:49:58.295
thank you thank you thank you

00:49:58.362 --> 00:49:59.996
Mr chairman members all right

00:50:00.063 --> 00:50:01.898
Mr Levine will move to item

00:50:01.965 --> 00:50:03.867
number two AB nineteen seventeen

00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:18.048
good morning Mister chair

be with all of you today --

00:50:24.287 --> 00:50:26.156
AB nineteen seventeen would

00:50:26.223 --> 00:50:27.824
ensure that personal information

00:50:27.891 --> 00:50:29.092
collected through contact

00:50:29.159 --> 00:50:31.395
tracing cannot be used for law

00:50:31.461 --> 00:50:33.330
enforcement purposes since the

00:50:33.397 --> 00:50:34.664
beginning of the code nineteen

00:50:34.731 --> 00:50:36.199
pandemic there have been over

00:50:36.266 --> 00:50:37.501
in happen in cases of coca

00:50:37.567 --> 00:50:39.403
nineteen in California and over

00:50:39.469 --> 00:50:40.237
eighty eight thousand people

00:50:40.303 --> 00:50:41.271
have died as a result of the

00:50:41.338 --> 00:50:43.106
virus one of the strategies

00:50:43.407 --> 00:50:44.808
used to limit the transmission

00:50:44.875 --> 00:50:46.643
of cobit nineteen has been

00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:48.211
the use of contact tracing

00:50:48.278 --> 00:50:49.579
which identifies individuals

00:50:49.646 --> 00:50:51.181
who test positive for code

00:50:51.415 --> 00:50:52.516
and the individuals they may

00:50:52.582 --> 00:50:54.050
have been in close contact

00:50:54.117 --> 00:50:55.852
with measures must be taken to

00:50:55.919 --> 00:50:57.721
protect Californians personal

00:50:57.788 --> 00:50:59.723
information and build public

00:50:59.790 --> 00:51:01.124
trust that contact treating

00:51:01.191 --> 00:51:02.893
information will not be used

00:51:02.959 --> 00:51:04.561
inappropriate inappropriately

00:51:04.628 --> 00:51:06.663
by law enforcement agency this

00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:08.298
is especially important minority

00:51:08.365 --> 00:51:10.066
and immigrant communities who

00:51:10.133 --> 00:51:11.101
have been disproportionately

00:51:11.168 --> 00:51:13.336
impacted by coded Reports of

00:51:13.403 --> 00:51:14.938
law enforcement officials being

00:51:15.005 --> 00:51:16.706
used to conduct contact rations

00:51:16.773 --> 00:51:17.941
only a poor use of public

00:51:18.008 --> 00:51:20.143
resources it is inappropriate

00:51:20.343 --> 00:51:21.645
in a road public trust in our

00:51:21.711 --> 00:51:22.879
efforts to control this in

00:51:22.946 --> 00:51:24.748
future pandemics the use of

contact tracing AB nineteen

00:51:26.349 --> 00:51:28.084

00:51:28.151 --> 00:51:30.086
confidence in future contact

00:51:30.153 --> 00:51:31.455
tracing efforts and ensure that

00:51:31.521 --> 00:51:33.757
contact tracing data is used

00:51:33.824 --> 00:51:36.493
only for public health purposes

00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:37.527

enforcement entities not only

00:52:30.881 --> 00:52:32.582
is contact tracing and I'm an

00:52:32.649 --> 00:52:34.084
inappropriate function for the

pleased with public health

people cooperate with contact

00:52:40.957 --> 00:52:43.593
tracing my contact information

00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:45.195
about who a person up with

public health goal because

00:52:51.001 --> 00:52:52.435

their personal information

00:52:54.404 --> 00:52:55.539
if it might implicate them

00:52:55.605 --> 00:52:57.107
in a crime or risk labeling

00:52:57.173 --> 00:52:58.508
them of Mr he added that it

00:52:58.575 --> 00:53:00.243
has a king member for example

00:53:00.877 --> 00:53:02.479
there's also a high degree of

00:53:02.546 --> 00:53:04.147
distrust for law enforcement and

00:53:04.214 --> 00:53:06.249
many communities particularly

00:53:06.316 --> 00:53:07.417
immigrant and those that are

00:53:07.484 --> 00:53:09.419
most impacted by police violence

00:53:09.486 --> 00:53:11.521

thank you gun violence

00:57:22.305 --> 00:57:24.808
is at its most devastating

00:57:25.241 --> 00:57:26.643
when it threatens our children

00:57:27.844 --> 00:57:29.345
in twenty twenty one there

00:57:29.412 --> 00:57:30.446
were approximately two hundred

00:57:30.513 --> 00:57:32.048
and fifty nine unintentional

00:57:32.115 --> 00:57:33.516
shootings by children resulting

00:57:33.583 --> 00:57:34.884
in a hundred and four deaths

00:57:35.251 --> 00:57:36.653
and a hundred and sixty eight

00:57:36.853 --> 00:57:39.055

00:57:39.122 --> 00:57:40.523
children of put other children

00:57:40.590 --> 00:57:42.692
at risk ninety one percent of

00:57:42.759 --> 00:57:43.793
the victims of the shootings

00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:45.461

00:57:47.330 --> 00:57:48.331
of the children shooting

00:57:49.732 --> 00:57:51.267
in California gun violence

00:57:51.334 --> 00:57:52.502
is the third leading cause of

00:57:52.569 --> 00:57:54.370
death for children and teens

00:57:55.638 --> 00:57:57.307
the epidemic of deadly violence

00:57:57.373 --> 00:57:58.641
is fueled by an industry that

00:57:58.708 --> 00:58:00.510
encourages children to hold a

00:58:00.577 --> 00:58:01.811
gun as soon as they can walk

00:58:02.946 --> 00:58:04.781
gun manufacturers target our

00:58:04.848 --> 00:58:06.549
kids are slick advertising even

00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:09.686
children's books the advertising

00:58:09.752 --> 00:58:11.354
for these weapons as shameless

00:58:11.855 --> 00:58:13.256
children in California are not

00:58:13.323 --> 00:58:14.824
allowed to buy or own a gun

00:58:14.891 --> 00:58:16.125
yet they're advertised across

00:58:16.192 --> 00:58:17.694
all forms of media cartoons

00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:18.995
video games and social media

00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:21.798
up providing first amendment

00:58:21.865 --> 00:58:22.932
concerns this bill follows

00:58:22.999 --> 00:58:25.068
similar state laws that place

00:58:25.134 --> 00:58:26.536
limits on advertising politics

00:58:26.603 --> 00:58:28.004
that adults may lawfully

00:58:28.071 --> 00:58:29.772
purchase and use but not minors

00:58:30.106 --> 00:58:31.541
for example alcohol cannabis and

00:58:31.608 --> 00:58:34.244
tobacco AB twenty five

00:58:34.310 --> 00:58:35.511
seventy one will prohibit a

00:58:35.578 --> 00:58:37.413

materials that advertise or

00:58:39.215 --> 00:58:40.850
market firearms weapons to

00:58:40.917 --> 00:58:42.952
anyone under the age of eighteen

00:58:43.286 --> 00:58:45.355
it's quite simple this bill

00:58:45.421 --> 00:58:46.823
would allow the Attorney General

00:58:46.890 --> 00:58:48.458
a district or county attorney --

00:58:48.825 --> 00:58:49.959

with parents and others all

00:59:17.387 --> 00:59:18.488
around the state who want to

00:59:18.554 --> 00:59:19.722
see California lead the way

00:59:19.789 --> 00:59:21.524
on gun violence prevention I

00:59:21.591 --> 00:59:22.759
have worked with a positive

00:59:22.825 --> 00:59:24.527
parenting nonprofit and local

00:59:24.594 --> 00:59:25.862
public health with the maternal

00:59:25.929 --> 00:59:27.096
child and adolescent health

00:59:27.163 --> 00:59:29.232
team in this work I have focused

00:59:29.299 --> 00:59:30.533
on developing programs to

00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:31.868
support parents and their kids

00:59:31.935 --> 00:59:33.202
beginning a pregnancy through

00:59:33.269 --> 00:59:35.071
early adulthood with the many

00:59:35.138 --> 00:59:36.506
worries parents already have

00:59:36.572 --> 00:59:37.540
the last thing they should have

00:59:37.607 --> 00:59:39.075
to worry about is gun companies

00:59:39.142 --> 00:59:40.376
trying to market firearms to

00:59:40.443 --> 00:59:42.278
their kids in addition to my

00:59:42.345 --> 00:59:43.613
work in public health I am also

00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:44.914
a former kindergarten teacher

00:59:44.981 --> 00:59:46.249
and my husband and I have raised

00:59:46.316 --> 00:59:48.284
three kids as both a teacher

00:59:48.351 --> 00:59:49.819
and a mom I know the importance

00:59:49.886 --> 00:59:51.220
of setting clear guardrails for

00:59:51.287 --> 00:59:52.622
kids including ensuring that

00:59:52.689 --> 00:59:54.223
all kids know that firearms are

00:59:54.290 --> 00:59:56.960
not toys the advertising

00:59:57.026 --> 00:59:58.728
guns to minors by using stuffed

00:59:58.795 --> 01:00:00.196
animals and cartoon characters

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:02.165
complicates parents ability to

01:00:02.231 --> 01:00:03.333
make that clear distinction two

01:00:03.399 --> 01:00:05.034
young kids that guns are not

01:00:05.101 --> 01:00:07.537
toys this important message is

01:00:07.603 --> 01:00:09.105
undermined when the state allows

01:00:09.172 --> 01:00:10.907
guns to be advertised in ways

01:00:10.974 --> 01:00:12.241
designed to appeal to children

01:00:12.308 --> 01:00:13.843
promoting a guns everywhere

01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:15.812
culture that tragically results

01:00:15.878 --> 01:00:17.246
in some kids getting access to

01:00:17.313 --> 01:00:18.514
guns and harming themselves or

01:00:18.581 --> 01:00:20.783
others AB twenty five seventy

01:00:20.850 --> 01:00:22.352

firearms in materials directed

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:25.955
to children and prohibit

01:00:26.022 --> 01:00:27.156
publication of fire arms

01:00:27.223 --> 01:00:28.758

materials that are attractive

01:00:30.126 --> 01:00:32.028
to minors our state laws

01:00:32.095 --> 01:00:33.896
already had knowledge two truths

01:00:33.963 --> 01:00:35.832
one firearms are especially

01:00:35.898 --> 01:00:37.633
dangerous in the hands of minors

01:00:37.867 --> 01:00:39.569
and to we have a responsibility

01:00:39.635 --> 01:00:40.803
to regulate the marketing of

01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:43.206
dangerous products to minors AB

01:00:43.272 --> 01:00:44.674
twenty five seventy one built

01:00:44.741 --> 01:00:46.342
a bridge between those concepts

01:00:46.409 --> 01:00:47.877
and closes the gap in our state

01:00:47.944 --> 01:00:49.846
law by regulating the marketing

01:00:49.912 --> 01:00:51.814
of firearms to children we

01:00:51.881 --> 01:00:53.449
should not allow for profit

01:00:53.516 --> 01:00:55.184
companies to inundate our kids

01:00:55.251 --> 01:00:56.819
with ads suggesting that deadly

01:00:56.886 --> 01:00:59.122
weapons are desirable toy we

twenty gun violence was the

01:01:38.661 --> 01:01:39.762
leading cause of death for

shows that farms are especially

01:01:46.969 --> 01:01:48.071

children should not have access

01:02:00.016 --> 01:02:01.117
to guns and that what they do

01:02:01.184 --> 01:02:03.086
they are at high risk -- this

here in strong opposition AB

01:04:43.412 --> 01:04:45.615
twenty five seventy one the U.

01:04:45.681 --> 01:04:46.916
S. Supreme Court made it clear

01:04:46.983 --> 01:04:47.984
that commercial speech does

01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:49.352
not fall outside the purview

01:04:49.418 --> 01:04:51.420
of the first amendment and

01:04:51.487 --> 01:04:54.190
-- that's from the Lorillard

01:04:54.257 --> 01:04:55.591
tobacco case -- and they

01:04:55.658 --> 01:04:56.892
applied the central Hudson

01:04:57.226 --> 01:04:59.428
-- parks at in dealing

01:04:59.495 --> 01:05:01.497
with commercial speech that

01:05:01.564 --> 01:05:03.399
outlined so as long as that

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:05.534
-- the speech concerned a

01:05:05.601 --> 01:05:07.036
lawful activity the government

01:05:07.103 --> 01:05:08.437
must the circumstantial State

01:05:08.504 --> 01:05:09.939
interested purportedly advanced

01:05:10.006 --> 01:05:11.240
bites regulation on speech

01:05:11.307 --> 01:05:12.375
the regulation must directly

01:05:12.441 --> 01:05:13.776
advances certain interest in the

01:05:13.843 --> 01:05:15.077
regulation of being there but

01:05:15.144 --> 01:05:16.445
the nearest means of which the

01:05:16.646 --> 01:05:18.347
to serve the state interest we

01:05:18.414 --> 01:05:20.149
feel like this bill just failed

01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:22.852
to meet that standard -- that

01:05:22.918 --> 01:05:24.553
you can see this legislation

01:05:25.354 --> 01:05:26.822
-- pants advertising that

01:05:26.889 --> 01:05:29.158
detracted to minors and I'll

01:05:29.225 --> 01:05:30.259
be brief because I I think

01:05:30.326 --> 01:05:31.394
the professor has is going to

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:32.528
provide some really good insight

01:05:32.595 --> 01:05:33.696
when it comes to the first

01:05:33.763 --> 01:05:36.165
amendment in this bill but it's

01:05:37.066 --> 01:05:38.367
still failed to account that

01:05:39.168 --> 01:05:41.304
minors can't lawfully

01:05:42.038 --> 01:05:43.472
possess firearms into for

01:05:43.539 --> 01:05:45.908
many lawful activities such

01:05:45.975 --> 01:05:48.878
as hunting or competition

01:05:48.944 --> 01:05:51.147
shooting X. better up -- and

01:05:51.213 --> 01:05:53.215
also that miners may find --

01:05:54.517 --> 01:05:56.185
the advertising with the tractor

01:05:56.252 --> 01:05:57.953
for the same reason why adults

01:05:58.421 --> 01:06:00.489
-- find advertising attractive

01:06:00.556 --> 01:06:01.490
and we just feel like this

01:06:01.557 --> 01:06:03.759
is going to completely fail

01:06:03.826 --> 01:06:05.194
on personal grounds we feel

01:06:05.261 --> 01:06:07.463
like this could really target

01:06:07.897 --> 01:06:10.366
-- for productive things such

01:06:10.433 --> 01:06:11.834
as hunter Education in R. three

01:06:11.901 --> 01:06:13.969
efforts by the state -- as

01:06:14.036 --> 01:06:16.405
well as -- -- complicate you'd

01:06:16.472 --> 01:06:18.507
shooting team six cetera --

01:06:18.574 --> 01:06:19.542
and I'll yield the rest of my

01:06:19.608 --> 01:06:21.344
time over to the professor --

01:06:21.410 --> 01:06:23.079
but weren't strong opposition

01:06:23.145 --> 01:06:25.314
thank you thank you N.

01:06:25.381 --> 01:06:27.783
we do not allow time yielded

01:06:27.850 --> 01:06:29.852
but I will call on you Jean

01:06:30.753 --> 01:06:33.689
Volek go ahead please

01:06:34.056 --> 01:06:36.392
yes yes thank you very much --

01:06:36.459 --> 01:06:38.127
I'm Eugene Volokh a professor

01:06:38.194 --> 01:06:39.895
of law at UCLA school of law

01:06:40.129 --> 01:06:41.497
where I specialize mostly in

01:06:41.564 --> 01:06:43.165
free speech law I'm testifying

01:06:43.232 --> 01:06:44.800
solely on my own behalf I'm

01:06:44.867 --> 01:06:46.168
not being compensated for this

01:06:46.235 --> 01:06:48.270
testimony by anyway I think

01:06:48.337 --> 01:06:49.805
even the bill as proposed to

01:06:49.872 --> 01:06:51.507
be amended would violate the

01:06:51.574 --> 01:06:53.042
first amendment for three

01:06:53.109 --> 01:06:55.811
reasons what is it would

01:06:55.878 --> 01:06:57.546
cover fully protected political

01:06:57.613 --> 01:06:59.382
speech and not just commercial

01:06:59.448 --> 01:07:02.084
advertising of a gun magazine

01:07:02.151 --> 01:07:03.519
publisher for instance our gun

01:07:03.586 --> 01:07:04.987
advocacy group that publishes

01:07:05.054 --> 01:07:06.589
a magazine would likely be

01:07:06.655 --> 01:07:08.591
covered as a quote firearm

01:07:08.657 --> 01:07:10.092
industry member close quote

01:07:10.159 --> 01:07:11.827
under the definition because it

01:07:11.894 --> 01:07:13.596
was formed to advocate for use

01:07:13.662 --> 01:07:15.531
or ownership of guns generally

01:07:16.132 --> 01:07:17.800
might endorse specific products

01:07:17.867 --> 01:07:19.001
and product reviews which of

01:07:19.068 --> 01:07:20.836
course are common in magazines

01:07:21.437 --> 01:07:23.272
and Lyft Kerry advertising for

01:07:23.339 --> 01:07:25.708
cuts that publisher advocacy

01:07:25.775 --> 01:07:27.109
group within be forbidden from

01:07:27.176 --> 01:07:28.511
for instance using cartoon

01:07:28.577 --> 01:07:29.879
characters even if it's in

01:07:29.945 --> 01:07:31.747
its fully protected political

01:07:31.814 --> 01:07:34.383
advertising it's a buys but by

01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:36.652
is that a radio ad war right

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:38.921
-- internet ad or Billboard

01:07:38.988 --> 01:07:40.956
urging gun ownership generally

01:07:41.023 --> 01:07:42.124
and not any product in

01:07:42.191 --> 01:07:44.760
particular but to even

01:07:44.827 --> 01:07:46.228
as to commercial advertising

01:07:46.295 --> 01:07:47.630
the law was unconstitutionally

01:07:47.696 --> 01:07:49.832
vague it covers any ads that

01:07:49.899 --> 01:07:51.700
are accorded tractive to minors

01:07:51.767 --> 01:07:53.235
close quote even if they're

01:07:53.302 --> 01:07:54.737
equally attracted to legal

01:07:54.804 --> 01:07:56.372
adult buyers often the same

01:07:56.439 --> 01:07:58.374
answer attracted to both in the

01:07:58.441 --> 01:08:00.142
specific examples don't resolve

01:08:00.209 --> 01:08:01.343
the vagueness problem because

01:08:01.410 --> 01:08:03.012
they're listed only as examples

01:08:03.245 --> 01:08:04.780
prefix to the phrase quote

01:08:04.847 --> 01:08:06.782
including but not limited to two

01:08:07.583 --> 01:08:09.185
close quote of

01:08:09.919 --> 01:08:11.921
three the law also covers

01:08:11.987 --> 01:08:13.255
constitutionally protected

01:08:13.322 --> 01:08:14.723
commercial advertising such as

01:08:14.790 --> 01:08:16.358
the use of caricatures of miners

01:08:16.425 --> 01:08:18.194
are cartoon characters in ads

01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:19.595
that are clearly targeted at

01:08:19.662 --> 01:08:22.264
adults -- -- lawfully buy guns

01:08:22.331 --> 01:08:23.332
so that their children could

01:08:23.399 --> 01:08:24.567
use those guns from illegal

01:08:24.633 --> 01:08:25.968
hunting or target shooting

01:08:26.202 --> 01:08:27.837
indeed California law expressly

01:08:27.903 --> 01:08:28.971
allows parents to have their

01:08:29.038 --> 01:08:30.606
children use guns this way under

01:08:30.806 --> 01:08:32.508
parental supervision and parents

01:08:32.575 --> 01:08:34.343
may well wish to buy guns --

01:08:34.410 --> 01:08:35.744
for their children to use for

01:08:35.811 --> 01:08:37.580
these purposes that advertising

01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:39.515
-- would normally be targeted to

01:08:39.582 --> 01:08:41.116
the local buyers the parents and

01:08:41.183 --> 01:08:43.118
not the children directly thank

01:08:43.185 --> 01:08:44.253
you for letting me testifying

01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:45.054
please let me know if you

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:46.822
have any questions thank you

01:08:48.824 --> 01:08:50.159
all right we'll go to others

01:08:50.226 --> 01:08:51.260
who would like to indicate

01:08:51.327 --> 01:08:52.828
opposition to AB twenty

01:08:52.895 --> 01:08:53.796
five seventy two is there

01:08:53.863 --> 01:08:54.964
anyone in the hearing room

01:08:56.899 --> 01:08:58.234
I'd say none operator would

01:08:58.300 --> 01:08:59.335
you open the lines for anyone

01:08:59.401 --> 01:09:00.302
who would like to indicate

01:09:00.369 --> 01:09:01.737
opposition to AB twenty

gun manufacturers -- we are

01:09:48.651 --> 01:09:49.718

01:10:07.236 --> 01:10:08.637
I want to thank the committee

01:10:08.704 --> 01:10:11.607
currently for such a great --

01:10:11.674 --> 01:10:13.676
analysis especially in going

01:10:13.742 --> 01:10:16.011
through the four pronged as --

01:10:16.812 --> 01:10:18.914
the test that the the the

01:10:18.981 --> 01:10:20.849
courts have have used to

01:10:20.916 --> 01:10:22.117
determine whether something

01:10:22.551 --> 01:10:24.386
like this is constitutional

01:10:24.453 --> 01:10:27.256
and I so wanted to appreciate

01:10:27.323 --> 01:10:28.591

thank you other comments

01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:37.266
questions of Mister Kalra on

a new you're here on behalf of

01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:40.769
Mr K. hand that I want to thank

01:10:40.836 --> 01:10:42.938
you for this bill opposition

01:10:43.005 --> 01:10:44.006
testimony not withstanding

01:10:44.073 --> 01:10:46.308
I think the analysis makes

01:10:46.375 --> 01:10:48.477
pretty clear that this is

01:10:48.677 --> 01:10:49.712
a very appropriate for the

01:10:49.778 --> 01:10:51.013
state of California to do

01:10:51.413 --> 01:10:53.649
that with that you may close

01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:55.317
up thank you Mister chair I

01:10:55.384 --> 01:10:56.585
on behalf of the centre about

01:10:56.652 --> 01:10:58.220
can respect we ascribe thank

01:10:58.287 --> 01:10:59.588
you and we will take this

01:10:59.655 --> 01:11:01.857
up when we get that elusive

01:11:01.924 --> 01:11:04.159
quorum thank you all right

01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:06.362
I am number three AB twenty

01:11:06.428 --> 01:11:07.730
one eighty eight Mister Cork

01:11:29.551 --> 01:11:31.820
hi good morning

01:11:32.121 --> 01:11:33.689
thank you chair and members

01:11:34.490 --> 01:11:35.958
even though California has

01:11:36.025 --> 01:11:38.661
legalized both medicinal

01:11:39.094 --> 01:11:40.496
and recreational cannabis

01:11:40.562 --> 01:11:43.132
use employees can still be

01:11:43.198 --> 01:11:44.299
discriminated against in the

01:11:44.366 --> 01:11:46.168
workplace for the consumption

01:11:46.468 --> 01:11:48.037
of this legal substance

01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:50.873
during their downtime so

01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:53.008
we all agree no one should

01:11:53.075 --> 01:11:54.376
ever show up to work hiring

01:11:54.443 --> 01:11:57.579
paired but most employers

01:11:57.646 --> 01:11:59.014
conducted drug tests they

01:11:59.081 --> 01:12:00.849
typically screen for the

01:12:00.916 --> 01:12:03.185
presence of non psychoactive

01:12:03.252 --> 01:12:05.821
cannabis metabolites well you

01:12:05.888 --> 01:12:07.489
get this from the urine test

01:12:08.057 --> 01:12:09.458
this test can be positive

01:12:09.525 --> 01:12:10.993
if you consume cannabis it

01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:12.928
anytime in the last month

01:12:13.729 --> 01:12:15.364
the positive metabolic test

01:12:15.431 --> 01:12:17.533
has no correlation to workplace

01:12:17.599 --> 01:12:19.935
safety or productivity testing

01:12:20.002 --> 01:12:22.037
for metabolite and penalizing

01:12:22.104 --> 01:12:23.605
employees for engaging in

01:12:23.672 --> 01:12:24.873
illegal activity on their

01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:27.576
downtime are absolute practices

01:12:27.643 --> 01:12:29.111
in the state of California

01:12:29.912 --> 01:12:33.482
THC is the compound in cannabis

01:12:33.549 --> 01:12:35.617
they can do psychoactive effects

01:12:36.218 --> 01:12:38.420
metabolites are what remain

01:12:38.487 --> 01:12:39.988
present in an individual's

01:12:40.055 --> 01:12:42.624
body's bodily fluids weeks

01:12:42.691 --> 01:12:44.460
after cannabis use and after

01:12:44.526 --> 01:12:46.695
the THC has been metabolized

01:12:48.397 --> 01:12:50.632
arm in the test of saliva

01:12:50.699 --> 01:12:52.034
you can directly to test

01:12:52.935 --> 01:12:55.137
actually detect the THC

01:12:55.971 --> 01:12:57.372
AB twenty one eighty eight

01:12:57.439 --> 01:12:58.941
would address these obsolete

01:12:59.007 --> 01:13:00.743
practices by making unlawful

01:13:00.809 --> 01:13:02.978
for an employer to discriminate

01:13:03.045 --> 01:13:04.379
against a person if they've

01:13:04.446 --> 01:13:06.515
consumed cannabis off the job

01:13:06.815 --> 01:13:08.784
or if they have non psychoactive

01:13:08.851 --> 01:13:10.385
cannabis metabolites in their

01:13:10.452 --> 01:13:12.521
urine hair or bodily fluids

01:13:13.155 --> 01:13:15.157
G. analysis states AB twenty

01:13:15.224 --> 01:13:17.259
one eighty eight does not

01:13:17.326 --> 01:13:19.528
protect prohibit pre employment

01:13:19.595 --> 01:13:21.396
testing does not prevent

01:13:21.463 --> 01:13:22.831
employers from maintaining a

01:13:22.898 --> 01:13:25.367
drug free workplace this bill

01:13:25.434 --> 01:13:27.202
is a ballot solution that

01:13:27.269 --> 01:13:29.872
protects the right of employees

01:13:29.938 --> 01:13:31.540
and employers and in fact

01:13:32.074 --> 01:13:34.042
a saliva test is a much better

01:13:34.109 --> 01:13:35.811
way to guarantee a drug free

01:13:35.878 --> 01:13:38.247
workplace then these other

01:13:38.313 --> 01:13:40.616
tasks which typically are done

01:13:40.883 --> 01:13:42.384
S. pre employment screening and

01:13:42.451 --> 01:13:44.620
then never used gap I'm

01:13:44.686 --> 01:13:46.421
here to testify in support is

01:13:46.488 --> 01:13:48.423
Gail Garinger from California

01:13:48.490 --> 01:13:50.926
normal thank you first witness

01:13:50.993 --> 01:13:53.428
please are yes thank you thank

01:13:53.495 --> 01:13:55.597
you are Mr chairman members

01:13:55.664 --> 01:13:57.900
of the committee and Dr clerk

01:13:58.333 --> 01:14:00.569
are you are California

01:14:00.636 --> 01:14:03.672
normally is proud to sponsor

01:14:03.739 --> 01:14:05.340
AB twenty one eighty eight

01:14:05.641 --> 01:14:08.377
all this talk to quick noted

01:14:08.443 --> 01:14:10.546
cannabis is legal in California

01:14:10.612 --> 01:14:12.147
and workers are supposed to have

01:14:12.214 --> 01:14:13.582
a right to engage in illegal

01:14:13.649 --> 01:14:16.185
activity while they are off the

01:14:16.251 --> 01:14:19.354
job yet countless workers

01:14:19.421 --> 01:14:21.023
get discriminated against on

01:14:21.089 --> 01:14:24.159
these are metabolite tests

01:14:24.226 --> 01:14:25.561
The don't detect actual

01:14:25.627 --> 01:14:27.396
impairment but rather past

01:14:27.462 --> 01:14:29.665
use of cannabis days or weeks

01:14:29.731 --> 01:14:32.701
previously in effect urine

01:14:32.768 --> 01:14:34.603
tests are like looking through

01:14:34.670 --> 01:14:36.705
workers trash and firing

01:14:36.772 --> 01:14:38.907
them empty beer or liquor

01:14:38.974 --> 01:14:42.044
bottles are fair --

01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:44.213
show this bill fixes this

01:14:44.279 --> 01:14:46.281
problem by banning employment

01:14:47.082 --> 01:14:48.917
metabolite tests except where

01:14:48.984 --> 01:14:51.153
federal law requires otherwise

01:14:51.987 --> 01:14:53.355
this is consistent by the

01:14:53.422 --> 01:14:54.656
way with the ruling of the

01:14:54.723 --> 01:14:57.459
California personnel board which

01:14:57.526 --> 01:14:59.828
found that a urine test does not

01:14:59.895 --> 01:15:02.064
establish that an employee is

01:15:02.130 --> 01:15:04.299
under the influence of marijuana

01:15:04.833 --> 01:15:07.502
and therefore does not justify

01:15:07.569 --> 01:15:08.604
discipline that was gonna

01:15:08.670 --> 01:15:11.773
Transportation case are

01:15:12.007 --> 01:15:14.676
again emphasizing that

01:15:14.877 --> 01:15:16.979
this bill in no way compromises

01:15:17.045 --> 01:15:18.947
employers ability to assure a

01:15:19.014 --> 01:15:20.883
safe and drug free workplace

01:15:20.949 --> 01:15:22.451
because it allows protested

01:15:22.517 --> 01:15:24.386
actually detect employment

01:15:24.987 --> 01:15:26.855
impairment these include

01:15:27.289 --> 01:15:29.157
computer tablet performance

01:15:29.224 --> 01:15:30.559
test which can detect

01:15:30.626 --> 01:15:33.395
impairment of any kind and also

01:15:33.462 --> 01:15:36.298
our saliva or oral fluid tests

01:15:36.498 --> 01:15:38.834
which detect marijuana's active

01:15:38.901 --> 01:15:42.271
ingredient THC for the hours

01:15:42.337 --> 01:15:44.072
during which users are actually

01:15:44.139 --> 01:15:46.341
under the influence let me

01:15:46.408 --> 01:15:48.210
set world fluid tests are more

01:15:48.277 --> 01:15:50.479
accurate all Lassen invasive

01:15:50.545 --> 01:15:53.015
and less costly than urine tests

01:15:53.081 --> 01:15:54.449
and have been federally approved

01:15:54.516 --> 01:15:56.418
for workplace use by Sam's

01:15:57.252 --> 01:15:59.755
are there is no science to show

01:15:59.821 --> 01:16:02.324
of the hearing test protect

01:16:02.991 --> 01:16:04.760
our jobs safety there's not a

01:16:04.826 --> 01:16:07.562
single FTA study has ever been

01:16:07.863 --> 01:16:10.032
done finding that urine testing

01:16:10.098 --> 01:16:12.167
is either safe or effective at

01:16:12.234 --> 01:16:14.036
providing workplace accidents

01:16:14.236 --> 01:16:16.305
and numerous studies have found

01:16:16.638 --> 01:16:18.273
otherwise that workers who

01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:20.175
test positive for metabolites

01:16:20.509 --> 01:16:21.643
have no higher risk of

01:16:21.710 --> 01:16:24.313
accidents even him are safety

01:16:24.379 --> 01:16:26.949
sensitive jobs are let me

01:16:27.015 --> 01:16:29.217
conclude by saying urine test

01:16:29.284 --> 01:16:32.487
are very high obnoxious

01:16:32.788 --> 01:16:35.190
invasion of workers personal

01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:37.459
bottle the privacy I mean

01:16:37.526 --> 01:16:39.561
we talk about mask mandates

01:16:40.262 --> 01:16:42.331
Bob we're talking about your

01:16:42.397 --> 01:16:44.399
in here I'm too frequently

01:16:44.466 --> 01:16:45.834
the tests were misused to

01:16:45.901 --> 01:16:47.936
discriminate against unpopular

01:16:48.003 --> 01:16:50.339
workers and minorities over

01:16:50.405 --> 01:16:52.407
twenty other states have laws

01:16:52.474 --> 01:16:54.009
protecting employment rights of

01:16:54.076 --> 01:16:56.211
legal cannabis it's time for

01:16:56.278 --> 01:16:58.347
California to follow suit we

01:16:58.413 --> 01:16:59.681
urge your support to the bill

the California chamber of

commerce -- morning --

01:19:14.049 --> 01:19:15.250
we are opposed AB two one

01:19:15.317 --> 01:19:16.384
eight eight as a job killer

01:19:16.451 --> 01:19:18.286
at this point I want to be

01:19:18.353 --> 01:19:19.654
clear we are in a talk to the

01:19:19.721 --> 01:19:21.123
office office we met yesterday

01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:22.357
and really appreciate on the

01:19:22.424 --> 01:19:24.392
discussion and we hope that --

01:19:24.593 --> 01:19:25.660
we shared and draft a man's we

01:19:25.727 --> 01:19:26.628
hope we can resolve a lot of

01:19:26.695 --> 01:19:28.196
her concerns here but presently

01:19:28.263 --> 01:19:29.564
remain opposed to chop killer

01:19:30.165 --> 01:19:31.032
our paramount concern with

01:19:31.099 --> 01:19:32.300
this bill is the workplace

01:19:32.367 --> 01:19:33.568
safety we are not opposed to

01:19:33.635 --> 01:19:34.836
saliva testing or marijuana

01:19:34.903 --> 01:19:36.138
use outside the workplace

01:19:36.438 --> 01:19:37.706
however we are very concerned

01:19:37.772 --> 01:19:39.141
with keeping such impairment

01:19:39.207 --> 01:19:40.909
out of the workplace -- I want

01:19:40.976 --> 01:19:42.177
to focus on one particular

01:19:42.244 --> 01:19:43.378
point because it seems like

01:19:43.445 --> 01:19:44.613
-- it you know it there was

01:19:44.679 --> 01:19:45.847
some confusion about this and

01:19:45.914 --> 01:19:46.948
and a difference of opinion of

01:19:47.015 --> 01:19:48.250
ours and I want to make clear

01:19:48.316 --> 01:19:50.819
reasoning -- we do believe

01:19:50.886 --> 01:19:52.087
the Texas bill actually does

01:19:52.154 --> 01:19:53.855
pre prohibit pre employment

01:19:53.922 --> 01:19:54.956
drug testing and I want to

01:19:55.023 --> 01:19:56.758
direct to the exact language

01:19:56.825 --> 01:19:57.726
of the bill receive this

01:19:57.792 --> 01:19:59.928
which is proposed section --

01:19:59.995 --> 01:20:02.631
one two nine four five for a

01:20:03.031 --> 01:20:05.634
one basically a says is unlawful

01:20:05.700 --> 01:20:07.202
discrimination is the person in

01:20:07.269 --> 01:20:09.771
any hiring conditions if

01:20:09.838 --> 01:20:11.540
based on the following a one the

01:20:11.606 --> 01:20:13.175
person's use of cannabis off the

01:20:13.241 --> 01:20:14.910
job away from the workplace my

01:20:14.976 --> 01:20:16.211
concern is that pre employment

01:20:16.278 --> 01:20:18.446
testing always relates to space

01:20:18.513 --> 01:20:19.648
outside of the workplace that's

01:20:19.714 --> 01:20:20.682
the nature of pre employment

01:20:20.749 --> 01:20:22.284
testing so that's the specific

01:20:22.350 --> 01:20:23.685
language we base our concern on

01:20:23.752 --> 01:20:24.786
I think that we have a different

01:20:24.853 --> 01:20:25.921
temptation from the author

01:20:25.987 --> 01:20:27.055
were hoping to address that

01:20:28.590 --> 01:20:30.926
-- turning to our other two

01:20:30.992 --> 01:20:32.194
brief -- concerns with the

01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:33.395
bill the remain obviously

01:20:33.461 --> 01:20:34.296
we have some concerns of

01:20:34.362 --> 01:20:35.564
placement fee how we're trying

01:20:35.630 --> 01:20:36.565
to look at places where that

01:20:36.631 --> 01:20:37.632
works and how to work on the

01:20:37.699 --> 01:20:38.733
mechanically we spoken to the

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:40.535
author's office about it and

01:20:40.602 --> 01:20:42.237
we are also looking at draft

01:20:42.304 --> 01:20:43.405
amendments to the federal

01:20:43.471 --> 01:20:44.539
protection language to deal with

01:20:44.606 --> 01:20:47.075
federal state conflicts again

01:20:47.142 --> 01:20:47.776
I want to highlight that we

01:20:47.842 --> 01:20:48.677
really appreciate the on going

01:20:48.743 --> 01:20:49.844
engagement the author but at

01:20:49.911 --> 01:20:51.213

reporting mechanism for school

01:34:22.423 --> 01:34:23.991

transparency regarding health

01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:44.812

01:35:53.514 --> 01:35:55.282
for the tech industry to be a

01:35:55.349 --> 01:35:56.450
partner and actually proposed

01:35:56.517 --> 01:35:57.551
something that they think

01:35:57.618 --> 01:35:58.819
would work as opposed to just

01:35:58.886 --> 01:36:00.855
opposing everything that that

01:36:00.921 --> 01:36:03.324
comes along so I find that

01:36:03.524 --> 01:36:04.792
frankly a little bit frustrating

01:36:04.859 --> 01:36:06.994

01:36:20.741 --> 01:36:22.076

tech industry recognizes the

01:36:27.882 --> 01:36:29.116
role that they play and the

01:36:29.183 --> 01:36:30.751
obligation to protect lives

01:36:31.051 --> 01:36:33.354
-- this is just one key

01:36:33.420 --> 01:36:34.755
element to helping that those

01:36:34.822 --> 01:36:35.856

01:40:58.685 --> 01:41:00.487
four two -- it's legislation

01:41:00.554 --> 01:41:01.388
that seeks to strengthen and

01:41:01.455 --> 01:41:02.890
clarify the existing tobacco

01:41:02.956 --> 01:41:05.025
directory statute to meet

California's obligations under

01:41:06.393 --> 01:41:07.394
the master settlement agreement

01:41:07.461 --> 01:41:08.829
otherwise known as the MSA

01:41:09.530 --> 01:41:10.998
-- this MSA provides for

01:41:11.064 --> 01:41:12.833
substantial annual payments

01:41:13.233 --> 01:41:14.435
from tobacco manufacturers to

01:41:14.501 --> 01:41:15.869
our state these payments are

01:41:15.936 --> 01:41:18.172
provided and -- in perpetuity

01:41:18.238 --> 01:41:19.273

01:41:21.675 --> 01:41:22.843
these payments are condition

01:41:22.910 --> 01:41:24.244
on California's enactment

01:41:24.311 --> 01:41:26.079
and the diligent enforcement

01:41:26.146 --> 01:41:28.649
of an escrow statute poses

01:41:28.715 --> 01:41:30.884
a since the some similar --

01:41:30.951 --> 01:41:32.052
so financial obligations on

tobacco companies that are

01:41:32.986 --> 01:41:35.255
not a party to the MSA and

01:41:35.322 --> 01:41:36.557
to prevent the state from a

01:41:36.623 --> 01:41:38.759
losing out on any payments this

01:41:38.826 --> 01:41:40.360
bill strengthens existing law

01:41:40.427 --> 01:41:41.361

01:41:44.932 --> 01:41:46.366
obligations by targeting non

01:41:46.433 --> 01:41:48.702
compliant bad actors meanwhile

01:41:48.769 --> 01:41:50.971
the fire safety act it --

01:41:51.338 --> 01:41:52.906
the prohibits cigarettes from

01:41:52.973 --> 01:41:54.475
being sold in California unless

01:41:54.541 --> 01:41:56.343
they meet fire safety standards

01:41:56.410 --> 01:41:57.744
under current law the state

01:41:57.811 --> 01:41:59.012
fire marshal review cigarettes

01:41:59.079 --> 01:42:01.248
to verify fire safety however

01:42:01.315 --> 01:42:02.616
due to certain restraints

01:42:02.683 --> 01:42:03.817
many cigarettes have been

01:42:03.884 --> 01:42:05.285
automatically approved which

01:42:05.352 --> 01:42:06.420
happens when the fire marshal

01:42:06.487 --> 01:42:08.222
takes no action on cigarette

01:42:08.288 --> 01:42:09.590
applications after ten days

01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:11.158
so this legislation will help

01:42:11.225 --> 01:42:13.327

important felt that would ensure

with a lock and a significant

01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:27.734

01:43:35.809 --> 01:43:36.877
does not remain the same over

01:51:54.641 --> 01:51:55.675
ten would fight against air

01:51:55.742 --> 01:51:57.477
pollution air quality violations

01:51:57.844 --> 01:51:59.112
-- by increasing the strict

01:51:59.179 --> 01:52:00.947
Max -- liability for negligent

01:52:01.014 --> 01:52:02.148
penalties for air quality

01:52:02.215 --> 01:52:04.417
polluters -- like some of those

01:52:04.484 --> 01:52:06.019
-- there are near my district

01:52:06.086 --> 01:52:08.455
currently we have about five --

01:52:09.422 --> 01:52:11.524
a frequent polluters -- we

01:52:11.591 --> 01:52:12.659
feel that increase the fines

01:52:12.725 --> 01:52:14.961
by threefold -- would help

01:52:15.028 --> 01:52:17.197
-- incentivize them to stop

01:52:17.263 --> 01:52:18.098
polluting because right now

01:52:18.164 --> 01:52:19.099
it's just the cost of doing

01:52:19.165 --> 01:52:20.300
business about five thousand

01:52:20.366 --> 01:52:22.368
dollars it's incurred and they

01:52:22.435 --> 01:52:23.970
continue to violate -- the air

01:52:24.037 --> 01:52:25.371
quality pollution rules that

01:52:25.438 --> 01:52:27.240
are currently in place -- this

01:52:27.307 --> 01:52:29.409
bill would affect -- other

industries as well -- which you

01:52:33.246 --> 01:52:34.614
respectfully and ask for an aye

01:52:34.681 --> 01:52:37.217

01:52:37.283 --> 01:52:39.586
witness please good morning

01:52:39.652 --> 01:52:40.887
chair members of the committee

01:52:40.954 --> 01:52:42.155
my name is Terrence Mann I'm

01:52:42.222 --> 01:52:43.423
the deputy executive officer

01:52:43.490 --> 01:52:44.891
for compliance and enforcement

01:52:45.291 --> 01:52:46.926
at south because taken deep we

01:52:46.993 --> 01:52:48.628
are pleased to sponsor AB twenty

01:52:48.695 --> 01:52:51.030
nine ten it seeks to provide

01:52:51.231 --> 01:52:52.765
more meaningful deterrence

01:52:52.832 --> 01:52:54.334
against air quality violations

01:52:54.400 --> 01:52:55.668
especially in disadvantaged

01:52:55.735 --> 01:52:57.637
communities by raising limits on

01:52:57.704 --> 01:52:59.539
civil penalties under existing

01:52:59.606 --> 01:53:01.407
law a company or facility that

01:53:01.474 --> 01:53:03.176
violates air quality rules

01:53:03.443 --> 01:53:05.345
regulations or permit conditions

01:53:05.645 --> 01:53:07.380
is strictly liable for a civil

01:53:07.447 --> 01:53:08.648
penalty of no more than ten

01:53:08.715 --> 01:53:10.617
thousand dollars per day this

01:53:10.683 --> 01:53:12.185
is by far the most common level

01:53:12.252 --> 01:53:13.920
of civil penalty that we use

01:53:13.987 --> 01:53:15.855
in enforcement actions but

01:53:16.122 --> 01:53:17.357
if the violator establishes

01:53:17.423 --> 01:53:18.458
an affirmative defense that

01:53:18.525 --> 01:53:19.926
the act was not intentional

01:53:19.993 --> 01:53:22.061
or negligent that the strict

01:53:22.128 --> 01:53:23.363
liability penalty cap goes

01:53:23.429 --> 01:53:24.831
down to five thousand dollars

01:53:25.331 --> 01:53:26.132
while those amounts may be

01:53:26.199 --> 01:53:27.667
significant to small mom and

01:53:27.734 --> 01:53:29.702
pop type businesses the current

01:53:29.769 --> 01:53:30.770
penalties for air quality

01:53:30.837 --> 01:53:32.605
violations have very little

01:53:32.672 --> 01:53:34.474
deterrent value to big companies

01:53:34.541 --> 01:53:36.342
and other well funded violators

01:53:37.243 --> 01:53:38.444
the ten thousand dollar maximize

01:53:38.511 --> 01:53:40.146
often just a slap on the wrist

01:53:40.213 --> 01:53:41.681
and consider the cost of doing

01:53:41.748 --> 01:53:44.083
business it also doesn't matter

01:53:44.150 --> 01:53:45.752
how expensive the air quality

01:53:45.818 --> 01:53:47.654
violation is for example there

01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:48.855
are rendering facilities in Los

01:53:48.922 --> 01:53:50.790
Angeles that process raw animal

01:53:50.857 --> 01:53:52.759
materials and admit terrible

01:53:52.825 --> 01:53:54.494
odors which in which can impact

01:53:54.561 --> 01:53:56.629
of thousands of people no how

01:53:56.696 --> 01:53:58.464
no matter how far its geographic

01:53:58.531 --> 01:53:59.499
reach and how many people are

01:53:59.566 --> 01:54:00.767
affected the recovery for this

01:54:00.833 --> 01:54:02.802
kind of over event will still be

01:54:02.869 --> 01:54:04.204
capped at ten thousand dollars

01:54:04.270 --> 01:54:05.805
or five thousand dollars per

01:54:05.872 --> 01:54:08.141
day per violation due to these

01:54:08.208 --> 01:54:09.175
low penalty amounts we see

01:54:09.242 --> 01:54:10.510
repeated violations from the

01:54:10.577 --> 01:54:12.145
same facilities despite our

01:54:12.212 --> 01:54:13.947
enforcement actions the family

01:54:14.013 --> 01:54:14.948
limits applied all kinds of

01:54:15.014 --> 01:54:16.216
facilities where we see regular

01:54:16.282 --> 01:54:17.917
non compliance including oil

01:54:17.984 --> 01:54:19.352
and gas drilling operations

01:54:19.419 --> 01:54:20.920
landfills and power plants to

01:54:20.987 --> 01:54:22.589
name a few and many of these

01:54:22.655 --> 01:54:24.324
facilities are located in

01:54:24.390 --> 01:54:25.925
or near our most vulnerable

01:54:25.992 --> 01:54:27.927
communities importantly this

01:54:27.994 --> 01:54:29.662
bill should not impact small

01:54:29.729 --> 01:54:31.130
family run businesses the health

01:54:31.197 --> 01:54:32.298
and safety code already lists

01:54:32.365 --> 01:54:33.566
several mitigating factors

01:54:33.633 --> 01:54:35.235
that must be considered when

01:54:35.301 --> 01:54:36.369
determining civil penalties

01:54:36.436 --> 01:54:38.071
for air quality violations this

01:54:38.137 --> 01:54:39.172
ensures the penalties are fair

01:54:39.239 --> 01:54:40.640
and match violator's ability

01:54:40.707 --> 01:54:42.475
to pay we respectfully request

01:54:42.542 --> 01:54:43.543

01:54:43.610 --> 01:54:45.144

01:54:45.211 --> 01:54:46.646
quality violations and in turn

Daly impacted communities

01:57:41.354 --> 01:57:43.089
communities in my district as

01:57:43.156 --> 01:57:45.024
they expose people to toxic air

01:57:45.091 --> 01:57:46.426
contaminants lead to shelter

01:57:46.492 --> 01:57:47.493
in place certifications and

01:57:47.560 --> 01:57:48.895
increase public health risks

01:57:49.495 --> 01:57:50.430
at my district there have been

01:57:50.496 --> 01:57:52.098
increases in air pollution

01:57:52.398 --> 01:57:53.733
complaints and the increasing

01:57:53.800 --> 01:57:54.934
flare events that refiners

01:57:55.001 --> 01:57:56.135
have led to incidents that have

01:57:56.202 --> 01:57:57.570
negatively impacted the health

01:57:58.371 --> 01:57:59.739
at the communities and have even

01:57:59.806 --> 01:58:01.007
impacted school closures in the

01:58:01.073 --> 01:58:02.809
surrounding areas specifically

01:58:02.875 --> 01:58:04.043
in twenty twenty one the Bay

01:58:04.110 --> 01:58:05.878
Area quality management district

01:58:05.945 --> 01:58:06.979
issued over two hundred and

01:58:07.046 --> 01:58:08.614
forty notices of violations to

01:58:08.681 --> 01:58:10.817
Bay Area refineries to dress the

01:58:10.883 --> 01:58:11.951
overall decline in compliance

01:58:12.018 --> 01:58:13.119
with air quality regulations

01:58:13.186 --> 01:58:14.454
AB eighteen ninety seven will

01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:15.855
increase the civil penalty

01:58:15.922 --> 01:58:18.024
sealing for violations of state

01:58:18.090 --> 01:58:19.292
or local air quality rules

01:58:19.358 --> 01:58:21.060
to thirty thousand dollars if

01:58:21.127 --> 01:58:22.628
the Vice violation results in

01:58:22.695 --> 01:58:24.030
a disruption to the community

01:58:24.397 --> 01:58:25.765
the civil penalty will also

01:58:25.832 --> 01:58:27.066
be raised up to one hundred

01:58:27.133 --> 01:58:28.868
thousand dollars for subsequent

01:58:28.935 --> 01:58:30.670
violations for each violation

01:58:31.003 --> 01:58:32.171
within a twelve month period

01:58:32.839 --> 01:58:33.673
refineries are one of the

01:58:33.739 --> 01:58:35.374
largest sources of pollutants

01:58:35.441 --> 01:58:36.676
and there's not much incentive

01:58:36.742 --> 01:58:37.510
with the current penalty

01:58:37.577 --> 01:58:38.845
structure to prevent violations

01:58:38.911 --> 01:58:40.146
of air quality regulation

01:58:40.546 --> 01:58:42.415
therefore eighteen AB eighteen

01:58:42.482 --> 01:58:43.382
ninety seven will increase

01:58:43.449 --> 01:58:44.550
the penalties for violations

01:58:44.617 --> 01:58:45.751
of air quality regulations so

01:58:45.818 --> 01:58:47.053
that these penalties can become

01:58:47.420 --> 01:58:48.488
more of a deterrent for any

01:58:48.554 --> 01:58:50.556
future violations I want to

01:58:50.623 --> 01:58:51.958

acknowledge Committee staffer

01:59:25.925 --> 01:59:27.393
there well written analysis

01:59:27.894 --> 01:59:29.061
people that live in refinery

01:59:29.128 --> 01:59:30.496
communities experience some of

01:59:30.563 --> 01:59:31.898
the highest cumulative health

01:59:31.964 --> 01:59:33.966
burdens in California even

01:59:34.033 --> 01:59:35.334
in circumstances where the

01:59:35.401 --> 01:59:37.236
refineries are operating within

01:59:37.303 --> 01:59:38.838
all their permit conditions

01:59:39.305 --> 01:59:40.940
unfortunately refineries

01:59:41.007 --> 01:59:42.275
don't always operate within

01:59:42.341 --> 01:59:43.976
their permit conditions and in

01:59:44.043 --> 01:59:45.611
twenty twenty one alone the air

01:59:45.678 --> 01:59:47.146
district issued over two hundred

01:59:47.213 --> 01:59:48.948
forty notices of violation

01:59:49.482 --> 01:59:51.083
refinery community residents

01:59:51.150 --> 01:59:52.818
also experienced at least

01:59:52.885 --> 01:59:54.687
thirty flaring events in twenty

01:59:54.754 --> 01:59:56.656
twenty one this is actually a

01:59:56.722 --> 01:59:58.624
decrease in flaring come the

01:59:58.691 --> 02:00:00.593
twenty nineteen when refinery

02:00:00.660 --> 02:00:02.495
communities experienced seventy

02:00:02.562 --> 02:00:04.363
two flaring events that's a

02:00:04.430 --> 02:00:06.465
flaring event every five days

02:00:06.532 --> 02:00:07.700
where you might be told to stay

02:00:07.767 --> 02:00:09.569
inside your child might not

02:00:09.635 --> 02:00:11.337
be able to go to school or you

02:00:11.404 --> 02:00:12.772
might have to seek medical care

02:00:12.838 --> 02:00:14.307
because of excess emissions of

02:00:14.373 --> 02:00:16.676
sulfur oxides particulate matter

02:00:16.943 --> 02:00:19.111
and toxic air contaminants the

02:00:19.178 --> 02:00:20.746
penalty sealing for these events

02:00:20.813 --> 02:00:22.448
was ten thousand dollars in the

02:00:22.515 --> 02:00:24.483
year two thousand and is risen

02:00:24.550 --> 02:00:26.118
only nine percent in the last

02:00:26.185 --> 02:00:28.454
twenty two years imagine being

02:00:28.521 --> 02:00:30.222
a refinery community resident

02:00:30.289 --> 02:00:31.457
and knowing that this type of

02:00:31.524 --> 02:00:33.392
disruption in your community is

02:00:33.459 --> 02:00:35.027
only worth slightly over a ten

02:00:35.094 --> 02:00:36.829
thousand dollar fine and the

02:00:36.896 --> 02:00:38.731
companies making record profits

02:00:39.298 --> 02:00:40.399
I'd like to thank Assembly

02:00:40.466 --> 02:00:41.801
member wicks for her leadership

02:00:41.867 --> 02:00:43.169
in authoring AB eighteen ninety

02:00:43.235 --> 02:00:44.971
seven which takes a small

02:00:45.037 --> 02:00:46.539
step towards better aligning

02:00:46.606 --> 02:00:48.007
penalties for refineries

02:00:48.074 --> 02:00:49.775
violating air quality permits

02:00:50.009 --> 02:00:51.777
causing community disruptions

02:00:51.978 --> 02:00:54.213
and endangering public health AB

02:00:54.280 --> 02:00:55.748
eighteen ninety seven proposes

02:00:55.815 --> 02:00:57.216
a modest increase to thirty

02:00:57.283 --> 02:00:58.484
thousand dollars for certain

02:00:58.551 --> 02:01:00.486
penalties at refineries and a

02:01:00.553 --> 02:01:02.154
further increase for repetitive

02:01:02.221 --> 02:01:03.856
violations the burden refinery

02:01:03.923 --> 02:01:05.825
communities while these modest

02:01:05.891 --> 02:01:07.226
amounts can't fully mitigate

02:01:07.293 --> 02:01:09.028
the impacts in these communities

02:01:09.095 --> 02:01:10.563
we hope it discourages thinking

02:01:10.630 --> 02:01:11.864
about these events as a minor

02:01:11.931 --> 02:01:13.933
cost of doing business thank you

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:15.167

eighteen A. B. H. ninety seven

02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:49.402
communities near petroleum

02:01:49.468 --> 02:01:51.070
refineries including my own

02:01:51.137 --> 02:01:53.105
are at high risk for exposure

02:01:53.172 --> 02:01:55.441
to toxic releases at the most

02:01:55.508 --> 02:01:57.443
extreme in a toxic release

02:01:57.510 --> 02:01:58.811
of a chemical like modified

02:01:58.878 --> 02:02:00.846
hydrochloric acid in danger

02:02:00.913 --> 02:02:02.048
hundreds of thousands of the

hundreds of thousands of lives

02:02:04.583 --> 02:02:06.419
more commonly experience however

02:02:06.652 --> 02:02:08.387
if exposure to toxic releases

02:02:08.454 --> 02:02:09.822
that while not immediately

02:02:09.889 --> 02:02:11.924
fatal still harm human health

02:02:12.858 --> 02:02:14.126
according to the south coast air

02:02:14.193 --> 02:02:15.428
quality management district's

02:02:15.494 --> 02:02:17.329
multiple air toxic exposure

02:02:17.396 --> 02:02:19.765
study the codes for commute the

02:02:19.832 --> 02:02:21.300
commute to Wilmington Carson

02:02:21.367 --> 02:02:22.368
and watch Long Beach have a

02:02:22.435 --> 02:02:24.303
relative air toxic cancer risk

02:02:24.637 --> 02:02:25.638
eighty eight to ninety nine

02:02:25.705 --> 02:02:27.440
percent higher than the rest of

02:02:27.506 --> 02:02:29.742
the south coast air basin it

02:02:29.809 --> 02:02:31.243
should be no surprise then why

02:02:31.310 --> 02:02:32.712
the residents of my community

02:02:32.778 --> 02:02:34.580
let's Long Beach have an average

02:02:34.647 --> 02:02:36.315
I have on average a sixty

02:02:36.382 --> 02:02:38.184
eight year shorter lifespan

02:02:38.250 --> 02:02:39.118
than their counterparts in

02:02:39.185 --> 02:02:41.954
east Long Beach unfortunately

02:02:42.021 --> 02:02:43.289
topic provider could talk

02:02:43.355 --> 02:02:44.490
to be leases from refineries

02:02:44.557 --> 02:02:45.825
are treated no different than

02:02:45.891 --> 02:02:47.860
any other toxic release such

02:02:47.927 --> 02:02:49.829
small penalty pet no practical

02:02:49.895 --> 02:02:51.197
deterrence considering that the

02:02:51.263 --> 02:02:52.398
oil industry is among the most

02:02:52.465 --> 02:02:53.466
profitable industries in the

02:02:53.532 --> 02:02:56.035
world AB eighty to ninety seven

02:02:56.102 --> 02:02:57.503
would address this by creating

02:02:57.570 --> 02:02:58.971
a new civil penalty of up to

02:02:59.038 --> 02:03:00.272
thirty thousand dollars for

02:03:00.339 --> 02:03:02.208
toxic release at refinery the

02:03:02.274 --> 02:03:04.076
results in a severe disruption

02:03:04.143 --> 02:03:05.978
to the community and exposure

02:03:06.045 --> 02:03:07.246
twenty five people or more

02:03:08.147 --> 02:03:09.515
further this bill would also

02:03:09.582 --> 02:03:10.816
create a new hundred thousand

02:03:10.883 --> 02:03:12.384
dollars civil penalty for

02:03:12.451 --> 02:03:14.320
subsequent toxic release at

02:03:14.386 --> 02:03:16.789
refinery if it's a recurrence

02:03:16.856 --> 02:03:18.257
within the next twelve months

02:03:19.058 --> 02:03:20.025
though the the bill these

02:03:20.092 --> 02:03:21.360
amounts are still relatively

02:03:21.427 --> 02:03:22.895
low they are an improvement

02:03:22.962 --> 02:03:24.296
over the currently operates

02:03:24.363 --> 02:03:25.865
penalties for these reasons

02:03:25.931 --> 02:03:27.066
we ask for your support for

02:03:27.133 --> 02:03:28.534

listed is there anyone here

02:05:02.995 --> 02:05:04.163

eighteen ninety seven thank you

02:05:07.700 --> 02:05:08.968
Mr chairman members the legacy

02:05:09.034 --> 02:05:10.202

02:05:10.269 --> 02:05:11.470
association representing

02:05:11.537 --> 02:05:13.672
the state's refiners -- in

02:05:13.739 --> 02:05:16.542
opposition respectfully The

02:05:16.609 --> 02:05:19.111
bill arbitrarily -- increases

02:05:19.178 --> 02:05:20.746
penalties to the -- defined

02:05:20.813 --> 02:05:23.048
amount which we see as arbitrary

02:05:23.449 --> 02:05:25.818
that's unclear criteria for what

02:05:25.885 --> 02:05:27.386
a community the disruption to

02:05:27.453 --> 02:05:29.221
community is does not define

02:05:29.288 --> 02:05:30.489
it hearing testimony we've

02:05:30.556 --> 02:05:32.691
heard a number of potential --

02:05:32.925 --> 02:05:35.160
options for shelter in place

02:05:35.227 --> 02:05:36.996
to serious exposure to toxics

02:05:37.563 --> 02:05:38.831
The bill itself does not define

02:05:38.898 --> 02:05:40.132
what a disruption to community

02:05:40.199 --> 02:05:42.201
is making it arbitrary and

02:05:42.268 --> 02:05:44.103
and broad and finally the bill

02:05:44.169 --> 02:05:45.537
singles out a single industry

02:05:45.604 --> 02:05:46.672
and I will note that it's in

02:05:46.739 --> 02:05:47.773
direct contrast to the bill

02:05:47.840 --> 02:05:49.842
you just heard or it increases

02:05:49.909 --> 02:05:52.278
penalties across board equal

02:05:52.344 --> 02:05:53.746
violations should require eagle

02:05:53.812 --> 02:05:55.714
penalties this bill sets a

02:05:55.781 --> 02:05:57.383
precedent by single singling

02:05:57.449 --> 02:05:59.351
out a single industry and for

02:05:59.418 --> 02:06:00.986
those reasons we oppose and

02:06:01.053 --> 02:06:01.820
-- thank you for your time

02:06:02.321 --> 02:06:03.789

I see none operator you may open

02:06:11.764 --> 02:06:13.699
the lines for any body who would

02:06:13.766 --> 02:06:14.867
like to indicate opposition

02:06:14.934 --> 02:06:16.502
to AB eighteen ninety seven

02:06:18.404 --> 02:06:18.837

your posts this bill please

press one then zero at this time

02:06:34.687 --> 02:06:35.854
sure there is no one queuing

02:06:35.921 --> 02:06:37.189
up at this time all right

02:06:37.256 --> 02:06:38.223
thank you are pretty may

02:06:38.290 --> 02:06:40.225
close the lines I will bring

02:06:40.292 --> 02:06:41.260
it back to the committee

02:06:41.327 --> 02:06:43.362
questions comments Mister Kalra

02:06:45.731 --> 02:06:47.499
-- I think -- the the chair

02:06:47.566 --> 02:06:49.001
for bring this forward when

02:06:49.068 --> 02:06:50.903
-- I was sharing the Bay Area

02:06:50.970 --> 02:06:51.971
climb managed to strip his

02:06:52.037 --> 02:06:53.739
by eight years ago so we are

02:06:53.806 --> 02:06:55.107
making efforts back then to

02:06:55.174 --> 02:06:56.475
try to increase at the back of

02:06:56.542 --> 02:06:58.143
my bad thousand dollars right

02:06:58.210 --> 02:07:00.279
now when I recall and so even

02:07:00.346 --> 02:07:02.681
back then -- legislation was

02:07:02.915 --> 02:07:05.017
stymied at the time and so

02:07:05.384 --> 02:07:06.986
unfortunate we're still making

02:07:07.052 --> 02:07:07.920
those efforts but we have to

02:07:07.987 --> 02:07:09.355
keep trying because the other

02:07:09.421 --> 02:07:11.490
reality is even at ten dollars

02:07:11.557 --> 02:07:12.825
per violation it just consumes

02:07:12.891 --> 02:07:14.660
orders absorbs the cost of doing

02:07:14.727 --> 02:07:16.662
business hopefully with more

02:07:16.729 --> 02:07:18.998
appropriate -- of fines we can

02:07:19.064 --> 02:07:21.200
actually have some incentives

02:07:21.266 --> 02:07:22.768
-- move especially in terms

02:07:22.835 --> 02:07:24.069
of equipment upgrades and

02:07:24.136 --> 02:07:26.972
and investment in safety

02:07:27.039 --> 02:07:29.041
-- safety equipment would

02:07:29.108 --> 02:07:30.476
have you in infrastructure

02:07:30.843 --> 02:07:31.977
other be more of a sense to do

02:07:32.044 --> 02:07:34.513
that rather than rely on

02:07:34.580 --> 02:07:36.348
-- the order rather than pay

02:07:36.415 --> 02:07:38.250
fines especially if there are

02:07:38.650 --> 02:07:40.119
I still think I mean even these

02:07:40.352 --> 02:07:42.688
fines are in a move -- --

02:07:42.755 --> 02:07:45.391
are of but I guess the

02:07:45.457 --> 02:07:46.358
the most you could possibly

02:07:46.425 --> 02:07:48.627
do so I get the help of my

02:07:48.694 --> 02:07:49.928
but hopefully it's enough to

02:07:49.995 --> 02:07:52.231
actually create some more

02:07:52.297 --> 02:07:53.499
long standing improvements

02:07:53.565 --> 02:07:54.666
to some of the facilities

02:07:54.967 --> 02:07:56.835
in terms of safety so thank

02:07:56.902 --> 02:07:59.071

02:07:59.872 --> 02:08:01.707
