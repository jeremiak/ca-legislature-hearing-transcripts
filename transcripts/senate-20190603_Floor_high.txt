CAN YOU FORGIVE THEM AND LOVE THEM BECAUSE THERE AREN'T MANY PERFECT PEOPLE AROUND. AND BECAUSE THE PENALTY FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO LOVE HIM PERFECT PEOPLE. IS CONDEMNING ONESELF THE LONELINESS. ARE YOU CAPABLE OF FORGIVING A LOVING GOD EVEN WHEN YOU FOUND OUT THAT HE IS NOT PERFECT EVEN WHEN HE IS LET YOU DOWN AND DISAPPOINTED YOU. ARE PERMITTING BAD LOOK FITNESS AND CRUELTY IN HIS WORLD. AND PERMITTING SOME OF THOSE THINGS TO HAPPEN TO YOU. CAN YOU LEARNED ELEVEN FORGET HIM DESPITE HIS LIMITATIONS AS JOE DOES. AND DID YOU WANT TO LEARN TO FORGIVE AND LOVE YOUR PARENTS.

TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AS THE ONE HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF CONGRESS PASSING THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENTAS MANY OF YOU KNOW THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE U. S. CONSTITUTION WAS RATIFIED RATIFIED BY THIRTY SIX STATES. IN NINETEEN TWENTY AND GRANTED WOMEN THE RIGHT TO VOTE FOR OVER SEVENTY YEARS WOMEN BATTLED FOR SUFFRAGE AND SINCE THEN WOMEN HAD CONTINUED THE FIGHT FOR GENDER EQUALITY. THESE COURAGEOUS WOMEN FOUGHT FOR THE RIGHT TO VOTE AND IN THE PROCESS FURTHER SOLIDIFIED THE IMPORTANT MOVEMENT THAT CONTINUES TODAY. WHILE OTHER ETHNICITIES AND RACES DIDN'T GAIN FULL VOTING RIGHTS UNTIL DECADES LATER THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT WAS A CLEAR STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. OVER A CENTURY AGO U. S. SUFFRAGES CAREFULLY CHOSE THE COLORS TO REPRESENT THEIR MOVEMENT PURPLE WHITE. AND GOLD THE COLORS WERE TARGETED TOWARDS NEWSPAPERS THAT IN THE DAY PRINTED IN BLACK AND WHITE BUT ALSO SPECIFICALLY CHOSE WHITE TO APPEAR NON THREATENING AND MAKE IT HARDER. FOR PEOPLE TO CRITICIZE THEIR APPEARANCE TODAY WOMEN AROUND THE COUNTRY CONTINUE TO WEAR WHITE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT WE MUST CONTINUE TO BUILD ON WOMEN'S SUCCESSES. AND ACHIEVEMENTS AND THAT OUR WORK IS CERTAINLY NOT COMPLETE AS AMERICANS WE HAVE THE POWER TO CREATE CHANGE AND DEMAND THE QUALITY NOT JUST FOR US NOW BUT NOW. BUT FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS I ASKED THAT WE THINK AND WE HONOR THE WOMEN WHO FOUGHT FOR THESE RIGHTS THAT WE HAVE SECURED AN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT OUR FIGHT CONTINUES MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. IS THE ANY IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR CHIANG. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. TODAY I STAND AS THE ONLY FEMALE ASIAN AMERICAN LAWMAKER IN THE ENTIRE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE. IT IS A PROFOUND FEELING. IF I WAS BORN IN ANOTHER TIME I WOULD NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE. I WOULD NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO HAVE INFLUENCE OVER WHO REPRESENTS ME IN THIS VERY INSTITUTION. AND TODAY I STAND BEFORE YOU AS ONE REPRESENTING NEARLY A MILLION PEOPLE FROM MY COMMUNITY AND REASON OF CALIFORNIA. I'D LIKE TO THINK THE CHAIR OF THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS FOR BRING THIS RESOLUTION TO US. THE HELP REMIND ALL OF US THAT WHILE WE HAVE WORK TO DO ON THE QUALITY. WE HAVE MADE SO MUCH PROGRESS AND WE SHOULD NOT FORGET HOW FAR WE HAVE COME. AND AS A CO AUTHOR OF THIS RESOLUTION I STRONGLY URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. SENATOR DRAWS A THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. IT TOOK DECADES AFTER THE PASSAGE OF THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT. TO MAKE VOTING A REALITY FOR MANY WOMEN IN OUR COUNTRY. STILL TODAY WOMEN OF COLOR FACE BARRIERS AN EXERCISE IN THIS FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE THIS FACT REMEMBER AND HONOR WOMEN OF COLOR WHO LED THE FIGHT FOR SUFFRAGE. SO JOURNAL TRUTH AND ACTIVISTS AN ABOLITIONIST FOUGHT BRAVELY THROUGHOUT HER LIFE FREE QUALITY. SHE DELIVERED HER POWERFUL AIN'T I A WOMAN SPEECH AT THE EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE WOMEN'S RIGHTS CONVENTION IN OHIO AFTER FACING EXCLUSION FROM MANY IN THE MOVEMENT. THE INFLUENCE OF IDA B. WELLS INSPIRED MANY WOMEN TO ACTIVISM. AND STILL RESONATES TODAY. BORN INTO SLAVERY HE WAS A GIFTED JOURNALIST AN ORGANIZER WHO WORKED TIRELESSLY IN THE ANTI LYNCHING EFFORTS. DESPITE GREAT RISK TO HER OWN LIFE. HER DEVOTION TO JUSTICE AND DEMOCRACY CULMINATED HER TRANSFER ME TRANSFORMATIVE ROLE IN THE SUFFRAGE MOVEMENT AND THE ULTIMATE SUCCESS OF THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT. LET US NEVER FORGET THE IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS OF THESE COURAGEOUS WOMEN OF COLOR NGUYEN SPIRED US TODAY TO SPEAK TRUTH ABOUT EQUALITY I RISE AND THANK THE AUTHOR -- IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION [inaudible] SENATOR JACKSON'S. IT'S THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MADAM PRESIDENT IT'S SLICE IT ALWAYS HAS A NICE RING TO IT MADAM PRO TEM ALSO HAS A NICE RING TO IT -- THIS WAS A LONG HARD FOUGHT BATTLE. IT TOOK DECADES FOR THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT TO BE PASSED IT TOOK WOMEN WHO WERE WILLING TO BE FORCE FED. WHEN THEY WERE IMPRISONED? IN ORDER TO MAKE A STATEMENT AND IT COST MANY OF THEM THEIR HEALTH IN SHORT IN THEIR LIVES BUT IT IS SO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IN A SOCIETY THAT CLAIMS TO BE ONE THAT CELEBRATE TO QUALITY. IT CELEBRATES EQUAL RIGHTS FOR ALL THAT WE'VE HAD THIS BATTLE BUT THIS BATTLE IS ONLY JUST BEGUN AS WE HAVE SEEN OVER THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS. THE EFFORT TO DENY WOMEN THERE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY IN LIFE BY CONTROLLING THEIR OWN BODIES IS SOMETHING THAT CONTINUES TO BE A CHALLENGE FOR US. THE FACT THAT WOMEN ARE STILL NOT PAID EQUALLY FOR SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR WORK WHETHER IT'S WOMEN OF COLOR OR JUST WOMEN. OVERALL IN OUR SOCIETY WE HAVE NOT BEEN GIVEN THAT EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY THAT IS OUR BIRTHRIGHT THAT THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT REAFFIRMED WE ALSO FIND OURSELVES THE VICTIMS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. IN THE WORKPLACE SEXUAL ASSAULT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. WE ARE A LONG WAY AWAY FROM THE QUALITY BUT THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT BY THOSE THOUSANDS OF WOMEN'S UPON WHOSE WHOSE SHOULDERS WE NOW STAND. DESERVE TO BE HONORED TODAY FOR THEIR EFFORT THEIR DETERMINATION AND THEIR PERSISTENCE AND WITH THAT I RISE ALSO TO CELEBRATE THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT RECOGNIZING THAT WE STILL HAVE AN EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT THAT WE NEED TO PASS. AND EQUALITY IS STILL SOMETHING THAT IS NOT QUITE WITHIN OUR GRASP BUT WE GET CLOSER AND CLOSER EVERY DAY WITH THE KIND OF DETERMINATION THAT ALLOWS ME TO SAY. MADAM PRESIDENT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE [inaudible] SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT TODAY I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT OF AS FAR FORTY THREE AND I WISH TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM TINA ALL. OF FOR INTRODUCING THIS VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF RESOLUTIONS THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION WHICH GUARANTEES WOMEN THE RIGHT TO VOTE AND IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL PIECE OF OUR HISTORY AS WE MOVE FORWARD TOWARDS EQUALITY IN THIS COUNTRY. AS SUSAN B. ANTHONY ONCE THATTHIRD THERE NEVER WILL BE COMPLETE EQUALITY UNTIL WOMEN THEMSELVES. CAN HELP MAKE LOSS AND A LACK LAWMAKERS SOME VERY PROUD TO STAND HERE ON THIS FLOOR AS I LOOK AROUND TO SEE ALL MY FEMALE COLLEAGUES WEARING WHITE. AND PAYING TRIBUTE TO THOSE THAT CAME BEFORE US SO TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO TAKE A MOMENT TO HONOR. ALL ROSE AND WHICH AS WE KNOW WAS THE FIRST -- ELECTED SENATOR IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO PAY TRIBUTE TO OUR PRO TEN OUR FIRST FEMALE.

TREMENDOUS LEADERS FOR FOR BREAKING THE GLASS CEILING AND ALLOWING US TO FOLLOW THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO WITH THAT I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE. MADAM PRO TEM ATKINS. MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU SO MUCH I STAND AS A VERY PROUD MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS. AND CO AUTHOR OF THIS MEASURE -- AND OF COURSE I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN SAID THAT AS CALIFORNIA GOES SO GOES THE REST OF THE NATION. THE SENTIMENT APPLIES PERFECTLY TO THE PASSAGE OF THE NATION'S NINETEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. IN CALIFORNIA WE LET IN WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE BY GRANTING GRANTING I MIGHT SAY WE WE USE THAT PHRASE A LOT GRANTING. GRANTING WOMEN THE RIGHT TO VOTE IN NINETEEN ELEVEN NEARLY A DECADE EARLIER THAN THE FEDERAL RECOGNITION. AGAIN IT JUST SOUNDS RIDICULOUS I APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA BARBARA TALKING ABOUT THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT. I WAS A COLLEGE STUDENT WORKING VERY HARD IN MY HOME STATE OF VIRGINIA TO GET THAT PASSED. IT SEEMS ILLOGICAL. THAT THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT IS SO CONTROVERSY ALL. WE PROVIDE SO MANY -- EXAMPLES OF INCREDIBLE LEADERSHIP AND YET STILL. THAT IS CONTROVERSY WILL -- BUT I WOULD SAY WELL WE CELEBRATE THE AMENDMENT AND I APPRECIATE THE RECOGNITION THAT WE'VE GIVEN TO WOMEN. WHO WITH THE SUPPORT OF PEOPLE HERE HAVE RISEN TO POWERS OF LEADERSHIP RECOGNIZE OUR OWN SECRETARY OF THE SENATE -- WHO WAS RIGHTLY RECOGNIZED IN HER -- WORDS THAT DAY ARE STILL -- AS FILLED WITH THE IDEALS OF WHAT IT MEANS FOR US TO BE IN THIS CHAMBER ON THIS VERY CARPET AS WOMEN -- I JUST I THOUGHT IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE MOMENT AND WANTED TO RECOGNIZE. THAT AS WELL SO WHILE WE CELEBRATE THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION I THINK WE NEED TO KEEP IN MIND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF OUR WORK IN SETTING STANDARDS FOR THE NATION TO FOLLOW. NOT MOVE BACKWARDS ON MOVE FORWARD OUR WORK TAKES ON SPECIAL MEANING THESE DAYS IN PARTICULAR AS OUR SISTERS THROUGHOUT THE NATION FIGHT TO PRESERVE THEIR VERY RIGHT TO CONTROL THEIR OWN BODIES. AND FUTURES AGAINST ONGOING ATTACKS AT EVERY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT. SO PLEASE JOIN ME AND MY COLLEAGUES WHO'VE ALREADY SPOKEN ON THIS RESOLUTION TO COMMEMORATE THE HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF CONGRESS PASSING THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT I ASK FOR YOUR EYES OUT [inaudible] SENATOR HERTZBERG. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I JOIN WITH THE PRO TEM AND RECOGNIZING THE ODDITY OF HAVING TO RECOGNIZE A RIGHT THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN. INALIENABLE AND NOT REQUIRE. AN AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION. BUT I JUST WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO THIS BODY TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE ONLY TWENTY SEVEN WORDS IN THIS AMENDMENT. THAT IS WE DEBATE ON THIS FLOOR OFTEN ISSUES A BIG PRINCIPLE AND BIG BILLS THAT ARE FULL OF A NUMBER OF PAGES. THAT SOMETIMES IT ONLY TAKES A FEW WORDS THOUGHTFUL WORDS TO ACTUALLY CHANGE THE COURSE OF HISTORY IN THE APPROPRIATE DIRECTION I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE. IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE [inaudible] THING. US SENATOR MORE LIKE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. CALIFORNIA IS A LEADER. IN THIS MOVEMENT AND OCTOBER OF NINETEEN ELEVEN PROPOSITION FOUR WAS ON THE BALLOT. TO GRANT WOMEN THE RIGHT TO VOTE. IT WAS A RATHER INTERESTING CAMPAIGN. THE BALLOT MEASURE WAS SOUNDLY DEFEATED IN SAN FRANCISCO. IT BARELY PASSED IN LOS ANGELES. AND AS THE BOATS. RECOUNTED [inaudible] IT PASSED. WITH ONLY THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN VOTES IN PAST ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY BUT IT MADE CALIFORNIA THE SIX STATE TO ALLOW WOMEN.

BUT I'M LIKE TWENTY YEARS AGO. CANCER IN MANY RESPECTS IS NO LONGER [inaudible] LIFE THREATENING. THERE ARE NOW IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OVER EXCUSE ME IN AMERICA ALONE WE HAVE FIFTEEN AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE. AND WORLDWIDE OVER THIRTY TWO MILLION PEOPLE. WHO ARE ALIVE TODAY? HAVING FOUGHT CANCER AND SURVIVED.

MY THIRD SON OUR THIRD CHILD MY SECOND SON -- WAS SIX MONTHS OLD. AND I STILL REMEMBER THAT DAY. CLEARLY AT OF ANY DAY OF MY LIFE CLEAR AS A BELL. THAT DECEMBER AFTERNOON. IREMEMBER THE CAR I WAS SITTING IN. I REMEMBER THE RAIN FALLING ON THE WINDSHIELD. I REMEMBER -- WONDERING HOW MY GONNA TELL MY WIFE. THAT -- THE SOLE BREAD WINNER OF THE HOME [inaudible] HAS CANCER. AND FOR ME FORTUNATELY I HAD ONE OF THE EASIEST CANCERS TO OVERCOME. BUT NOT EVERYBODY WHO HEARS THOSE THREE WORDS. IS IN -- FORTUNATE SITUATIONS I WAS -- BUT I AM THANKFUL FOR ALL OF THE CANCER RESEARCH THAT HAD HAPPENED PRIOR. TO MY A DIAGNOSIS. AND ALL OF THE RESEARCH THAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE MY DIAGNOSIS. AND IT DOES GIVE YOU A HEART AND A EMPATHY. NOT JUST FOR CANCER ILLNESS BUT FOR ANY ON THIS I THINK. THAT -- SOMEBODY MIGHT BE STRUGGLING WITH. AND SO I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL THIS RESOLUTION FORWARD. AND I WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORTED AND ASKED -- FOR THAT WE'D ALL SUPPORTED THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SENATOR JOHN SENATOR PAN. I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SENATORS -- I TO RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT THE BILL AND I'VE MADE IT IS HARD TO FOLLOW THE ELOQUENCE MY GOOD FRIEND FROM SANTA BARBARA AND SHARING HER OWN EXPERIENCES AND ALSO -- MILD A COLLEAGUE AS WELL -- AND RIGHT NOW I MYSELF HAVE NEVER HAD CANCER -- BUT I'VE HAD FAMILY MEMBERS WHO HAVE -- WHO'VE PASSED AWAY FROM CANCER. I SHOULD NOTE THAT THERE ARE OVER FIFTEEN MILLION PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE UNITED STATES OR CANCER SURVIVORS -- THE ODDS OF ANYONE OF US GETTING CANCERS ABOUT 38% -- SOMETIME IN OUR LIFETIME. AND OFTENTIMES CERTAINLY IS I THINK WAS ELOQUENTLY SHARED -- THE DIAGNOSIS OF CANCER CERTAINLY. FOCUSES ONE'S MIND IN A CERTAIN WAY AND BUT ALSO ONE OF THE REASON I'M HERE -- WHAT SPEAK UP WAS THE ALSO SAY IS THAT WHILE CERTAINLY WE TALK ABOUT PEOPLE WHO? WHEN THEY GET THE DIAGNOSE CANCER BEING TREATED WITH CANCER WE RECOGNIZE THE THE CHALLENGES THEY FACE IN THE FACT OUR INVESTMENTS IN? IMPROVING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IN -- INVESTMENTS AND BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH HAVE EXTENDED OUR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE MORE CANCER SURVIVORS. AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN BUT ALSO A MAKE NOTE THAT. WE CAN'T SAY THAT ONCE YOUR CANCER SURVIVOR THAT THERE ARE CONTINUING ON GOING NEEDS -- ON GOING -- OUR ISSUES THE CONTINUE TO DEAL WITH WHAT THE OF CANCER AS A CHILD OR AS AN ADULT -- WE TALK ABOUT PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS RIGHT IF YOU HAD CANCERS THAT CANCER IS NOT WHAT IS DISEASES WHERE IT'S LIKE OH WELL YOU KNOW JUST HERE AND IT'S GONE RIGHT IT. IT'S SORT OF LINGERS AND WHAT AND WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN IS IS YOU GO ON YOUR LIFE EVEN WHEN IT SEEMS TO HAVE GONE AWAY. AND SO I THINK THAT CERTAINLY I THINK THE CHALLENGE. HERE TODAY FOR ALL OF US IS IS THAT AS RECOGNIZE THIS RESOLUTION AND CANCER SURVIVOR DAY IS THAT THE THINK ABOUT THE CANCER SURVIVORS AND THAT. THE SURVIVORS THEY STILL NEED. PEOPLE STILL NEED HELP AND WE NEED TO BE HERE SUPPORT THEM AS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE KIND OF ASSISTANCE -- TO OUR FELLOW CALIFORNIANS BECAUSE IT SAID. 38% OF US WILL EVENTUALLY HAVE TO FACE THAT DIAGNOSIS HOPEFULLY MANY OF US WILL MAKE THROUGH IT. BUT WE WILL STILL PERHAPS STILL NEED HELP BEYOND -- THAT DIAGNOSIS AND INITIAL TREATMENT SO I URGE A SUPPORT AND I THINK AGAIN MY GOOD FRIEND FROM SANTA BARBARA FOR BRING THIS UP PUT RESOLUTION. FOR SEEING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR JACKSON YOU MAY CONCLUDE YES THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION AND TO TRULY WE WILL SEE WE ALL HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS. WHO HAVE SUFFERED THROUGH A CANCER DIAGNOSIS WE NEED TO DO MORE BECAUSE MORE PEOPLE ARE SURVIVING AND AS OUR POSITION FROM SACRAMENTO POINTED OUT THOSE NEEDS? CONTINUE AND SO WE CELEBRATE TODAY. SURVIVORS BUT THIS IS ALSO A CALL TO ACTION WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO FIND MORE RESOURCES WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND. THOSE ARE TREATMENTS FOR ALL PEOPLE WHO MEET OR WHO. FIND THEMSELVES HAVING TO MEET THIS CHALLENGE WE NEED TO HAVE MORE SURVIVOR FRIENDLY LEGISLATION TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR CANCER SURVIVORS. AND RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS ALL OF US EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY SO I WILL RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT NOT JUST FOR THIS RESOLUTION.

AS A NURSE COORDINATOR FOR THE PEDIATRIC ELECTRO PHYSIOLOGY SERVICES LEASE TO WORK ON PAEDIATRIC CARDIOLOGISTS DOCTOR KEVIN SHANNON. ONE DAY DOCTOR SHANNON CAME UP OF IDEA. A CAMP IN CALIFORNIA FOR CHILDREN OF HEART DISEASE. LEASES RESPONSE. WE CAN DO THAT. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT SHE DID.

FOR THE PAST TWENTY FOUR YEARS LEASE AND DOCTOR SHANNON HAVE BEEN PROVIDING A FREE MEDICALLY SUPERVISED RESIDENTIAL SUMMER CAMP. FOR CHILDREN LIVING WITH HEART DISEASE. MANY OF THE KIDS AT HEART TRANSPLANTS IT WAS NICE TO BE ABLE TO GO SOME PLACE WHERE PEOPLE WOULD SEE A SCAR. ON THEIR CHEST AND REALIZE THAT THERE WERE NO DIFFERENT THAN.

ON AND BE FELT BY CHILDREN IN FAMILIES FOR GENERATIONS TO COME. OUR PATHS CROSSED BECAUSE WE USED TO HAVE FUND RAISERS AND TEMECULA -- HAD A VERY -- DEAR FRIEND -- WHOSE DAUGHTER DOBBY -- HAD OPEN HEART SURGERY AND UNFORTUNATELY. THE COMBAT A VERY YOUNG AGE AND IN HONOR OF HER DAUGHTER BOBBI -- SHE GOT INVOLVED WITH THIS CAMP TO MAKE SURE THAT.
