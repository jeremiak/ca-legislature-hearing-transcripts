01:55:05.031 --> 01:55:06.899
THE LEVEL AND THE GREED OF

01:55:06.966 --> 01:55:09.102
ENGAGEMENT WILL DEPEND ON MUCH

01:55:09.168 --> 01:55:12.605
WE CAN GET. PP OUT WE HAVE A WE

01:55:12.672 --> 01:55:14.974

01:55:29.155 --> 01:55:31.758
THROUGH THE NORMAL. PROCESS

01:55:31.824 --> 01:55:33.126
EVENTUALLY THE NORMAL PROCESS

01:55:33.192 --> 01:55:34.627
WILL STABILIZE AND WE WOULD

01:55:34.694 --> 01:55:37.964
EXPECT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND

01:55:38.031 --> 01:55:39.565
OTHERS TO START PROCURING

01:55:39.632 --> 01:55:40.533

CONTRACTS AS I SAID MY OPENING

01:56:36.122 --> 01:56:38.825
STATEMENT. I THINK- IT'S EASY

01:56:38.891 --> 01:56:39.559
TO BE A MONDAY MORNING

01:56:39.625 --> 01:56:42.161
QUARTERBACK. IN THE SENSE OF-

01:56:42.228 --> 01:56:43.730
LAYING BLAME AT FOLKS

01:56:43.796 --> 01:56:45.598
DOORSTEPS- THE REALITIES

01:56:45.665 --> 01:56:47.600
PEOPLE'S LIVES ON THE LINE- THE

01:56:47.667 --> 01:56:49.802
GOVERNOR-FOLKS. IN YOUR

DEPARTMENT HEAD THAT QUICKLY-

01:56:52.271 --> 01:56:53.873
TO MAKE SURE WE CAN SECURE THE

01:56:53.940 --> 01:56:56.642
SUPPLIES AND CERTAINLY. CERTAIN

01:56:56.709 --> 01:56:57.677
MODERATE APPROPRIATE. ENACTED

01:56:57.744 --> 01:57:02.348
PLEA TO ENSURE THE SAFETY- BUT

01:57:02.415 --> 01:57:04.684
CERTAINLY THE- BLUE FLAME IS

01:57:04.751 --> 01:57:06.853
THE KIND OF STICKS OUT AS- SOME

01:57:06.919 --> 01:57:08.454
REAL ODD STUFF THERE COULD YOU

01:57:08.521 --> 01:57:09.589
WALK ME THROUGH CONVALESCENCE

01:57:09.655 --> 01:57:13.559
LEARNED- HOW WERE. YOUR WHAT

01:57:13.626 --> 01:57:14.894
WHAT PRECAUTIONS ARE IN PLACE

01:57:14.961 --> 01:57:16.929
NOW AND ONE THAT COMES TO MIND

01:57:16.996 --> 01:57:17.430
IS LIKE YOU KNOW WHO IS

01:57:17.497 --> 01:57:20.700
AUTHORIZED I KNOW YOU SAID THE

01:57:20.767 --> 01:57:21.934
AGENCY HAD SCREWED. THE

01:57:22.001 --> 01:57:25.204
CONTRACTS WE- HAVE WE LIMITED

01:57:25.271 --> 01:57:25.772
THAT POOL A GREAT DEAL GOING

01:57:25.838 --> 01:57:31.711
FORWARD. I DON'T I WOULDN'T

01:57:31.778 --> 01:57:33.513
CHARACTERIZES LIMITING THE POOL

01:57:33.579 --> 01:57:35.982
I THINK THAT WE WHEN WE GET IN

01:57:36.048 --> 01:57:39.886
THESE LARGE- CONTRACTS- THERE'S

01:57:39.952 --> 01:57:40.553
A LOT OF COLLABORATIVE

01:57:40.620 --> 01:57:42.288
DISCUSSION AS TO WHETHER WE'RE

01:57:42.355 --> 01:57:44.390
GOING TO FORWARD WITH THESE ARE

01:57:44.457 --> 01:57:49.629
NOT- IN REAL TIME OF- THERE'S

01:57:49.695 --> 01:57:53.800
SO MUCH HAPPENING- NOW UP IN

01:57:53.866 --> 01:57:54.367
THE TIME FRAME THAT WE WERE

01:57:54.434 --> 01:57:56.335
TALKING ABOUT- WE'RE WAS

01:57:56.402 --> 01:57:59.205
LITERALLY- YOU KNOW WE WERE

01:57:59.272 --> 01:58:01.507
HAVING A CASE WHERE. YOU KNOW

01:58:01.574 --> 01:58:03.776
WE WOULD GET OPPORTUNITY ARE

01:58:03.843 --> 01:58:05.945
AND THEN MINUTES THAT

01:58:06.012 --> 01:58:09.315
OPPORTUNITY WAS LOST. HI IT WAS

01:58:09.382 --> 01:58:12.018
CHALLENGING FOR ALL OF US EVEN

01:58:12.084 --> 01:58:15.154
SEASONED- AND LOGISTICS

01:58:15.221 --> 01:58:17.056
SPECIALISTS AND EMERGING

01:58:17.123 --> 01:58:19.826
MEASURE PERSONNEL. TO BE ABLE

01:58:19.892 --> 01:58:24.997
TO- ADEQUATELY MAKE SURE THAT

01:58:25.064 --> 01:58:26.432
ALL THE LARGER DOT IN THE

01:58:26.499 --> 01:58:27.967
TEACHER CROSSES MUCH AS WE

01:58:28.034 --> 01:58:30.403
POSSIBLY COULD B DOING THAT IN

01:58:30.470 --> 01:58:31.537
THE TIME FRAME THAT WE WERE

01:58:31.604 --> 01:58:34.240
HAVING STREAM ONLY. EXTREMELY

01:58:34.307 --> 01:58:37.410
STRESSFUL ON THE PART OF

01:58:37.477 --> 01:58:38.578
EVERYBODY WANTED TO MAKE SURE

01:58:38.644 --> 01:58:41.147
THAT- THAT WERE DOING THE RIGHT

01:58:41.214 --> 01:58:46.919
THING. IT'S NOT USUAL. FOR YOU

01:58:46.986 --> 01:58:49.288
KNOW EIGHT HUNDRED FIVE HUNDRED

01:58:49.355 --> 01:58:50.857
MILLION DOLLAR CONTRACTS TO BE

01:58:50.923 --> 01:58:52.358
PUSHED THROUGH MAY IN THESE BIG

01:58:52.425 --> 01:58:54.260
EVENTS EXCEPT WE HAVE A BIG

01:58:54.327 --> 01:58:56.128
EARTHQUAKE. OR THE IN THE IN

01:58:56.195 --> 01:58:58.164
THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FIRES

01:58:58.231 --> 01:59:00.132
AND DURING THE CAMPFIRE WE WERE

01:59:00.199 --> 01:59:01.033
WE ARE MOVING TO SOME PRETTY

01:59:01.100 --> 01:59:02.368
BIG STUFF THROUGH THE DEBRIS

01:59:02.435 --> 01:59:04.670
OPERATIONS AND SEVENTEEN

01:59:04.737 --> 01:59:06.305
EIGHTEEN WERE SIGNIFICANTLY. A

01:59:06.372 --> 01:59:09.075
SIGNIFICANT- SO WE TAKE A LOT

01:59:09.141 --> 01:59:10.877
OF THINGS INTO CONSIDERATION

01:59:10.943 --> 01:59:14.380
INCLUDING. THE ABILITY TO. GET

01:59:14.447 --> 01:59:16.082
REIMBURSED AND BY THE WAY I DID

01:59:16.148 --> 01:59:18.985
MENTION MY TESTIMONY BUT- ONE

01:59:19.051 --> 01:59:19.552
THING WE MAKE SURE OF AS WE

01:59:19.619 --> 01:59:21.420
MOVE FORWARD WELL WE DON'T MAKE

01:59:21.487 --> 01:59:23.022
SURE OF IT IS ONE OF THOSE

01:59:23.089 --> 01:59:26.092
FACTORS BECAUSE IF THE IF THE

01:59:26.158 --> 01:59:27.660
NEED IS THERE. TO GET AN

01:59:27.727 --> 01:59:29.762
EMERGENCY COMMODITY THEN WE

01:59:29.829 --> 01:59:31.597
NEED TO DO IT YOUR REGARDLESS

01:59:31.664 --> 01:59:33.833
OF THE THREE A PERSON OR NOT.

01:59:33.900 --> 01:59:35.001
BUT IN ALMOST ALL THESE CASES

01:59:35.067 --> 01:59:37.937
IN REALLY 100% OF THESE CASES.

01:59:38.004 --> 01:59:40.973
THE ROLE REIMBURSABLE BY FEMA

01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:43.543
UP TO SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT. SO

01:59:43.609 --> 01:59:44.076
EVERY CONTRACT THAT WE PUT

01:59:44.143 --> 01:59:47.947
FORWARD WILL BE REIMBURSED- FEW

01:59:48.014 --> 01:59:54.587
ELIGIBILITY BY FEMA AT 75% WE

01:59:54.654 --> 01:59:56.822
A HUNDRED PERCENT. FOR THAT WE

01:59:56.889 --> 01:59:57.957
CALL EMERGENCY PROTECTIVE

01:59:58.024 --> 02:00:00.426
MEASURES THAT'S ALL THE FRONT

02:00:00.493 --> 02:00:00.993
AND STUFF THAT WE'RE TALKING

02:00:01.060 --> 02:00:04.096
ABOUT. AND WE'RE HOPING THAT WE

02:00:04.163 --> 02:00:06.499
HEAR SOMETHING BACK SOON- ABOUT

02:00:06.566 --> 02:00:08.568
WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN GET THAT

02:00:08.634 --> 02:00:09.168
I'M WE'RE HEARING MAYBE COULD

02:00:09.235 --> 02:00:11.571
BE 90% BUT UNTIL THEN WE KNOW

02:00:11.637 --> 02:00:12.438
FOR A FACT THAT WHEN THE

02:00:12.505 --> 02:00:13.973
PRESIDENT TO PROCLAIM THE STATE

02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:16.042
AND A NATIONAL DISASTER MAJOR

02:00:16.108 --> 02:00:17.977
DISASTER. IT WAS 475%

02:00:18.044 --> 02:00:20.079
REIMBURSEMENT. SO WE

02:00:20.146 --> 02:00:21.080
COLLECTIVELY LOOK AT ALL OF

02:00:21.147 --> 02:00:22.481
THESE THINGS WERE MOVING

02:00:22.548 --> 02:00:24.350
FORWARD AND IN THE CASE OF BLUE

02:00:24.417 --> 02:00:26.652
FLAME. ARM THE VERY THAT WAS

02:00:26.719 --> 02:00:30.089
DONE WAS DONE- AND- AND TO THE

02:00:30.156 --> 02:00:31.557
BEST OF THE DEGREE POSSIBLE IN

02:00:31.624 --> 02:00:33.726
THE TIME FRAMES THAT THEY- HAD

02:00:33.793 --> 02:00:36.429
WORKING AND- ONE OF THE CHECKS

02:00:36.495 --> 02:00:38.364
AND BALANCES OF COURSE LIKE ANY

02:00:38.431 --> 02:00:39.265
CONTRACT THAT WE'RE WORKING

02:00:39.332 --> 02:00:41.601
WITH. IS IN OUR COLLABORATION

02:00:41.667 --> 02:00:44.503
WITH THE BANK WE TYPICALLY IN

02:00:44.570 --> 02:00:48.341
STATE SERVICE DON'T WIRE MONEY.

02:00:48.407 --> 02:00:50.543
AT THE TI BEFORE WE DON'T WIRE

02:00:50.610 --> 02:00:52.311
MONEY OR THE PERIOD BUT THE

02:00:52.378 --> 02:00:53.746
WIRE MONTY TO HAVE TO THE PRIOR

02:00:53.813 --> 02:00:55.548
TO GETTING A COMMODITY. IS

02:00:55.615 --> 02:00:57.483
REALLY NOT IN THE NORMAL

02:00:57.550 --> 02:01:00.386
PROCESS AND SO. THE CONDITIONS

02:01:00.453 --> 02:01:02.855
AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE

02:01:02.922 --> 02:01:04.790
DICTATING. ARE A LITTLE

02:01:04.857 --> 02:01:06.959
DIFFERENT QUE AND WE DID NOT

02:01:07.026 --> 02:01:07.660
HAVE TO DO THAT ALL OF THESE

02:01:07.727 --> 02:01:09.795
CASES. IN MANY CASES WE FELT

02:01:09.862 --> 02:01:12.098
LIKE YOU KNOW WE'VE ADDED THEM

02:01:12.164 --> 02:01:13.232
THROUGH AND- THE PERSON WAS

02:01:13.299 --> 02:01:16.902
EITHER TO SHADY OR- IT JUST DID

02:01:16.969 --> 02:01:17.870
NOT SEEM LIKE THEY COULD

02:01:17.937 --> 02:01:19.405
DELIVER. IN THE CASE OF BLUE

02:01:19.472 --> 02:01:22.541
FLAME ON AS I MENTIONED ALL THE

02:01:22.608 --> 02:01:23.209
THINGS I SPECIFICALLY RIGHT

02:01:23.275 --> 02:01:25.511
READ THROUGH. ALL WE FELT LIKE

02:01:25.578 --> 02:01:27.847
THERE WAS NO DEROGATORY WE'VE

02:01:27.913 --> 02:01:30.182
GONE THROUGH THAT PROCESS. EVEN

02:01:30.249 --> 02:01:31.517
TO THE POINT EVEN TALKING TO

02:01:31.584 --> 02:01:32.451
THREE AM TO TRY TO GO A

02:01:32.518 --> 02:01:34.020
DIFFERENT ROUTE THE LAST MONTH

02:01:34.086 --> 02:01:36.422
MINUTE. BUT KNOWING FULL WELL

02:01:36.489 --> 02:01:37.556
THAT WE WERE IN DESPERATE NEED

02:01:37.623 --> 02:01:39.725
OF AND NINETY FIVE. WE OPTED TO

02:01:39.792 --> 02:01:43.496
MOVE FOR WITH IT. AND ONE OF

02:01:43.562 --> 02:01:44.030
THE CHECKS AND BALANCE THE

02:01:44.096 --> 02:01:46.766
CAUGHT IT WAS- THE BANK- WHO

02:01:46.832 --> 02:01:49.869
RECOGNIZE THAT- THAT THAT-

02:01:49.935 --> 02:01:51.270
THERE WAS A PROBLEM. THE BANK

02:01:51.337 --> 02:01:53.239
THEN NOTIFY BOTH. THE TREASURER

02:01:53.305 --> 02:01:55.074
AND ARE OFF I AND THE

02:01:55.141 --> 02:01:56.642
DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES.

02:01:56.709 --> 02:01:58.477
ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY WHICH

02:01:58.544 --> 02:02:01.247
POINT. YOU KNOW THAT MIGHT WAS

02:02:01.313 --> 02:02:04.984
STOPPED AND WE PULL BACK AND-

02:02:05.051 --> 02:02:05.551
YOU KNOW THE REST IS HISTORY

02:02:05.618 --> 02:02:10.089
BEING GO THAT ROUTE SO. RIGHT

02:02:10.156 --> 02:02:12.091
WE TRY TO PUT MORE YOU KNOW WE

02:02:12.158 --> 02:02:15.728
TO IN REAL TIME. EXPANDED WE-

02:02:15.795 --> 02:02:19.398
ADDED- FROM THAT POINT- WE

02:02:19.465 --> 02:02:21.167
ADDED UP UP AND ELEMENT THAT WE

02:05:22.348 --> 02:05:23.983
GREAT QUESTION I THOUGHT A LOT

HAVE OPERATED DIFFERENTLY OR

02:05:46.205 --> 02:05:48.841
BETTER. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER

02:05:48.908 --> 02:05:52.678
THERE'S NO. LINEAR PATHWAY AND

02:05:52.745 --> 02:05:55.748
IN THIS PARTICULAR INCIDENT IS

02:05:55.814 --> 02:05:56.916
REALLY THE CASE I MEAN THIS WAS

02:05:56.982 --> 02:05:59.351
ABOUT AS A SYMMETRICAL IN MANY

02:05:59.418 --> 02:06:04.123
WAYS AS THEY GET IN THE IMPACT.

02:06:04.189 --> 02:06:06.558
THAT SAID I THINK THAT- THESE

02:06:06.625 --> 02:06:09.795
WERE ALL LIARS- THAT THE SYSTEM

02:06:09.862 --> 02:06:10.930

BUT- I THINK THAT- THERE WILL

02:06:29.581 --> 02:06:34.687
BE NO CERTAINLY I READ LIKE THE

02:06:34.753 --> 02:06:37.656

ENTITIES WITHIN GOVERNMENT THAT

02:22:28.973 --> 02:22:32.043

SITUATIONS. IN THE FUTURE. I

02:22:35.179 --> 02:22:37.682

LIKE THIS- LIKE I SAID MORE

02:22:40.285 --> 02:22:41.252

02:22:44.389 --> 02:22:46.324

SINGLE MORNING BETWEEN OUR

02:22:53.131 --> 02:22:54.565
THREE DIVISIONS JUST TO TALK

02:22:54.632 --> 02:22:57.769
ABOUT. FOR TEN CONTRACTS THAT

DIVISION THAT INVEST THE MONEY

02:23:04.642 --> 02:23:06.177
SO IF A LARGE CONTRACT

02:23:06.244 --> 02:23:10.181
OUTCOMES- DO THEN MY INVESTMENT

02:23:10.248 --> 02:23:11.816
OFFICE NEEDS TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:23:11.883 --> 02:23:14.485

WE INVEST ALL IDLE CASH TO MAKE

02:23:16.854 --> 02:23:17.822

ONLY THE STATE. OF WORLDWIDE.

02:39:06.169 --> 02:39:07.871
AND IT IS REALLY INCREASES THE

02:39:07.938 --> 02:39:09.172
SCALE AND THE LENGTH OF TIME

02:39:09.239 --> 02:39:10.540
