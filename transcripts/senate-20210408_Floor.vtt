CALLED THE PARTNERSHIP FLIP. IN

00:24:24.029 --> 00:24:26.431
THESE CLIPS BASICALLY ALLOW

INVESTORS TO GET THE TAX

00:24:26.998 --> 00:24:29.067

TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP THESE ARE

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:33.538
TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE AND

00:24:33.605 --> 00:24:35.240
FORMER THE VERY OUTSET OF THE

00:24:41.313 --> 00:24:42.714
CAUSED SOME CONFUSION BY

00:24:42.781 --> 00:24:45.016
PRODUCING. CERTAIN GUIDELINES

00:24:45.083 --> 00:24:46.251
THAT PROVIDE CONTRADICTORY

00:24:46.318 --> 00:24:47.919
DIRECTION BUT THE CHANGE OF

THE CHAIR YEAH SO- BUT MY

00:25:32.931 --> 00:25:34.733
QUESTION IS- SOLAR SYSTEMS DO

00:25:34.799 --> 00:25:38.403
NOT IT PAY LOCAL COUNTY TAXES

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:41.640
AND SO WITH THIS- THEN IT UP-

00:25:41.706 --> 00:25:43.775
AND SECURE ROLE SO THOUGH THOSE

00:25:43.842 --> 00:25:46.044
TAXES TYPICALLY GO. TO THE

00:25:46.111 --> 00:25:48.146
COUNTIES IN THE AREAS WHERE

00:25:48.213 --> 00:25:50.949
THESE SYSTEMS ARE BUILT AND

00:25:51.016 --> 00:25:53.084
THOSE ARE TAXES THAT HELP- FIND

00:25:53.151 --> 00:25:56.454
LAW ENFORCEMENT- JUVENILE

00:25:56.521 --> 00:25:58.323
JUSTICE ALL THOSE THINGS THAT-

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:00.258
COUNTIES PROVIDE AND THERE HAS

00:26:00.325 --> 00:26:01.326
BEEN EXEMPTION SO WHEN THIS

00:26:01.393 --> 00:26:03.595
CHANGES- OVER DOES THAT DOES

00:26:03.662 --> 00:26:05.297
THAT MONEY GO TO THE COUNTIES

00:26:05.363 --> 00:26:07.966
OR TO GO BACK TO THE INVESTORS-

00:26:08.033 --> 00:26:08.500
WHICH WE CAN GIVE ME SOME

00:26:08.566 --> 00:26:11.002
CLARIFICATION ON. WHAT HAPPENS

00:26:11.069 --> 00:26:12.837
HERE YES CERTAINLY. WELL TO THE

00:26:12.904 --> 00:26:13.939

VOTERS PASSED IN NINETEEN

00:26:16.041 --> 00:26:18.810

NINETEEN EIGHTY. THIS IS ONLY

00:26:28.653 --> 00:26:30.488
THIS QUESTION ABOUT HOW OLD THE

00:26:30.555 --> 00:26:32.958

ISSUE ABOUT DOLLARS THAT HAVE

00:26:43.635 --> 00:26:46.037
BEEN FLOWING. TO LOCAL

00:26:46.104 --> 00:26:47.238

MORE RATE OF RETURN AND MORE

00:27:23.408 --> 00:27:27.312
SOLAR ENERGY. BEING PRODUCED IN

THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK

YOU. IS THERE ANY FURTHER

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:32.550
DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS

ITEM. SEEING NONE SENATOR

00:27:37.155 --> 00:27:41.860
HERTZBERG- SENATOR BATES. THANK

00:27:41.926 --> 00:27:43.795
YOU MADAM PRESIDENT OF QUESTION

00:27:43.862 --> 00:27:47.265
FOR THE AUTHOR CORKTOWN- THE

00:27:47.332 --> 00:27:49.901
LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY IS BEEN.

00:27:49.968 --> 00:27:51.369
PASSING A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT

00:27:51.436 --> 00:27:53.371
CONSTITUTE FOR EXAMPLE LET'S

00:27:53.438 --> 00:27:56.708
SAY- PROPERTY TRANSFERS FROM-

00:27:56.775 --> 00:27:58.676
REASSESSMENT AND I THINK THE

00:27:58.743 --> 00:28:00.545
CONCERN HERE IS WE'VE WE'RE

00:28:00.612 --> 00:28:02.013
EXPANDING IT TO FINANCIAL

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:04.082
TRANSACTIONS IF I'M READING

00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:06.317
THIS CORRECTLY WHICH- KIND OF

00:28:06.384 --> 00:28:08.653
REPLICATE SIDE THE INFAMOUS

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:11.523
DALE SITUATION- WITH THE HOTEL

00:28:11.589 --> 00:28:13.725
IN- LOS ANGELES WHERE THE

00:28:13.792 --> 00:28:15.026
COUNTY LOST ABOUT A MILLION

00:28:15.093 --> 00:28:17.328
DOLLARS IN PROPERTY TAX BECAUSE

00:28:17.395 --> 00:28:18.963
THEY STRUCTURE THE TRANSACTION.

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:22.467
SO THAT NO ONE ON MORE THAN 50%

00:28:22.534 --> 00:28:25.470
OF TE- PROPERTY WAS OWNED

00:28:25.537 --> 00:28:27.038
COULD YOU EXPLAIN HOW THIS IS

00:28:27.105 --> 00:28:29.074
NOT LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:30.508
FINANCIAL TRANSACTION THAT WERE

00:28:30.575 --> 00:28:32.077
SPEAKING OF IN THIS BILL

00:28:32.143 --> 00:28:34.512
ACTUALLY IS ADDING PEOPLE SO NO

00:28:34.579 --> 00:28:36.714
ONE OWNS YOU KNOW MORE THAN 50%

00:28:36.781 --> 00:28:38.183
AND I THINK THAT'S THE WE DON'T

00:28:38.249 --> 00:28:39.818
LIKE TO CALL IT A LOOPHOLE WE

00:28:39.884 --> 00:28:41.453
LIKE TO CALL IT A- AND M.

00:28:41.519 --> 00:28:43.755
MISINTERPRETATION. OF WHAT OF

00:28:43.822 --> 00:28:45.390
WHAT CONSTITUTES A CHANGE OF

00:28:45.457 --> 00:28:46.891
OWNERSHIP SO A LITTLE MORE

00:28:46.958 --> 00:28:48.460
EXPLANATION ON THAT WOULD BE

00:28:48.526 --> 00:28:50.195
HELPFUL FOR OUR LEGISLATURES

00:28:50.261 --> 00:28:52.430
TAKING A POSITION TO ACTUALLY

00:28:52.497 --> 00:28:55.033
EXAMS FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:59.637
THAT SHOULD BE COUNTED. AS

00:28:59.704 --> 00:29:01.106
CHANGE OF OWNERSHIPS. THAT

00:29:01.172 --> 00:29:02.540
COULD BE HAPPENING AT SIX AND-

00:29:02.607 --> 00:29:05.643
COMPLETELY. OPPOSED IN THE

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:07.679
MICHAEL DELL SITUATION THE

00:29:07.745 --> 00:29:09.280
HOTEL OF THE TO THE CORNER OF

00:29:09.347 --> 00:29:11.382
WILSHIRE BOULEVARD AND- OCEAN

00:29:11.449 --> 00:29:14.018
IN SANTA MONICA WAS OWNED BY

00:29:14.085 --> 00:29:17.088
PERSON A- THEY HELD IT IN THE

00:29:17.155 --> 00:29:19.791
CORPORATION. BOTH THE BUILDING

00:29:19.858 --> 00:29:21.126
AND THE LAND WAS HELD IN THE

00:29:21.192 --> 00:29:23.194
CORPORATION WHEN MICHAEL DELL

00:29:23.261 --> 00:29:25.463
PER PURCHASE THAT PROPERTY HE

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:26.931
PURCHASED THE CORPORATION A

00:29:26.998 --> 00:29:29.400
100% OF THE CORPORATION AND SO

00:29:29.467 --> 00:29:31.035
THE PROPERTY WAS NOT REASSESSED

00:29:31.102 --> 00:29:32.871
IN THAT TRANSACTION BECAUSE

00:29:32.937 --> 00:29:33.938
THAT WAS NO TRANSFER OF THE

00:29:34.005 --> 00:29:35.640
REAL ESTATE IN THAT LOOPHOLE

00:29:35.707 --> 00:29:37.842
JUST THE TRANSFER OF THE

00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:40.078
CORPORATE SHARES. THAT HAPPENS

00:29:40.145 --> 00:29:42.680
SUBSEQUENT IN TIME. THIS

00:29:42.747 --> 00:29:43.815
TRANSACTION IS COMPLETELY

00:29:43.882 --> 00:29:46.451
DIFFERENT. ON THE DAY YOU ENTER

00:29:46.518 --> 00:29:48.820
INTO TRANCE. FIRST IT'S

00:29:48.887 --> 00:29:51.022
INFORMED BY PROPOSITIONS SEVEN

00:29:51.089 --> 00:29:52.724
THAT WAS PASSED BY THE PEOPLE.

00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:53.992
SO THAT THEY CREATED THE

00:29:54.058 --> 00:29:55.994
EXEMPTION ALREADY EXISTED. THE

00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:57.896
NATURE OF THE DISCUSSION IS THE

00:29:57.962 --> 00:29:59.998
PARTNERSHIP FLIP WHEN YOU PUT

00:30:00.064 --> 00:30:01.699
THE MONEY DOWN HAPPENS ON DAY

00:30:01.766 --> 00:30:03.067
ONE IT WASN'T A SUBSEQUENT

00:30:03.134 --> 00:30:05.603
TRANSACTION AND ON DAY ONE IT'S

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:07.472
JUST FACILITATES THE ABILITY

00:30:07.539 --> 00:30:09.040
FOR THE PARTIES TO GET THE

00:30:09.107 --> 00:30:10.942
BENEFIT OF A ROBUST INVESTMENT

00:30:11.009 --> 00:30:13.678
ON THE ONE HAND YET FULLY ENJOY

00:30:13.745 --> 00:30:15.847
THE BENEFITS OF THE TAXES. THAT

00:30:15.914 --> 00:30:17.115
HELP INFORM AND REDUCE THE

00:30:17.182 --> 00:30:18.983
PRICE AND COST OF THE

00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:20.752
PARTICULAR TRANSACTION SO IT

00:30:20.818 --> 00:30:22.387
REALLY IS NOT COMPARE OF ALL AT

00:30:22.453 --> 00:30:24.522
ALL ONE IS HAS TO DO WITH THE

TRYING TO DO HERE. IS TO AVOID

00:41:14.104 --> 00:41:16.240
PAINFUL FOR ME AND I'M SURE

00:41:16.307 --> 00:41:18.409
MANY OF MY FEMALE COLLEAGUES. I

00:41:18.475 --> 00:41:21.145
IMAGINE COUNTLESS MOTHERS BEING

00:41:21.212 --> 00:41:23.147
SEPARATED FROM THEIR CHILDREN.

00:41:23.214 --> 00:41:26.016
MANY OF THEM JUST INSTANCE

00:41:26.083 --> 00:41:27.518
BEYOND HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT

00:41:27.585 --> 00:41:30.621
THEIR OWN WELL BEING HAVING TO

00:41:30.688 --> 00:41:31.155
WORRY WHERE THEIR CHILDREN

00:41:31.222 --> 00:41:33.724

00:41:33.791 --> 00:41:37.728
FED IS SOMEONE HURTING THEM.

00:41:37.795 --> 00:41:39.930
AND EVEN WORSE JUST WARNING

ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY CANNOT

00:41:41.732 --> 00:41:46.737
KEEP THEM SAFE. THEY HAVE TO

00:41:46.804 --> 00:41:49.940
HAVE EXPERIENCED DESPERATION.

00:41:50.007 --> 00:41:51.842
WONDERING IF THEY WERE GONNA

00:41:51.909 --> 00:41:54.445
MAKE IT THROUGH THAT THEY WOULD

00:41:54.511 --> 00:41:56.513
EVER SEE THEIR CHILDREN AGAIN.

00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:58.816
AS A TEACHER I HAD LESSON PLANS

00:41:58.883 --> 00:42:00.684
THAT REQUIRED MY STUDENTS TO DO

00:42:00.751 --> 00:42:04.455
SOME RESEARCH ON THE HOLOCAUST.

00:42:04.521 --> 00:42:05.289
ONE OF THE ITEMS THAT THEY

00:42:05.356 --> 00:42:07.324
WOULD ALWAYS FIND WAS EXTENSIVE

00:42:07.391 --> 00:42:10.828
RECORDS. OF DIARIES AND NOTES

00:42:10.895 --> 00:42:14.398
FROM CHILDREN. AND THE CURRENT

00:42:14.465 --> 00:42:16.433

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:18.769
YEARNING FOR EDUCATION TO COME

00:42:18.836 --> 00:42:21.505
BACK TO SCHOOL AND TO JUST FEEL

00:42:21.572 --> 00:42:23.173

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:26.677

IN THE SAME PERNICIOUS WAYS.

DISDAIN FOR WHAT HE CALLED

01:04:05.808 --> 01:04:08.711
RACIAL ALIENS. I JUST WANT TO

01:04:08.778 --> 01:04:10.346
SAY THAT ANTI SEMITISM IS STILL

01:04:10.413 --> 01:04:14.183
REAL. AND IN X. INSIDIOUS

01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:17.486
EXAMPLE OF HATE AND INTOLERANCE

01:04:17.553 --> 01:04:19.355
HATE CRIMES ARE ON THE RISE IN

01:04:19.422 --> 01:04:22.024
OUR JEWISH BROTHERS AND SISTERS

01:04:22.091 --> 01:04:24.327
CONTINUE TO BE TARGETED. EVERY

01:04:24.393 --> 01:04:27.296
SINGLE DAY. AND IT'S IMPORTANT

01:04:27.363 --> 01:04:29.332
TO NOTE THAT THE HOLOCAUST CAN

01:04:29.398 --> 01:04:31.834
HAPPEN AGAIN MAYBE WITH A

01:04:31.901 --> 01:04:32.368
DIFFERENT WORD A DIFFERENT

01:04:32.435 --> 01:04:36.038
TITLE. AND INSTEAD OF TRAINS

01:04:36.105 --> 01:04:38.841
AND CAMPS AND SHOWERS. TODAY'S

01:04:38.908 --> 01:04:40.643
TOOLS WOULD BE TECHNOLOGY AND

01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:45.615
CLICKS. AND DATA MISINFORMATION.

01:04:45.681 --> 01:04:47.049
BUT THE ONE ELEMENT THAT WOULD

01:04:47.116 --> 01:04:51.220
REMAIN CONSTANT. IS FEAR. FEAR

01:04:51.287 --> 01:04:56.959
OF ANOTHER FEAR OF ONE ANOTHER.

01:04:57.026 --> 01:05:00.596
FEAR OF SOMEONE ELSE. I ASK

01:05:00.663 --> 01:05:04.767
THAT WE CONTINUE TO. ACTIVATE

01:05:04.834 --> 01:05:07.236
THE WORD SOLIDARITY AND

01:05:07.303 --> 01:05:09.038
UNDERSTAND WHAT IT TRULY MEANS

01:05:09.105 --> 01:05:11.941
TO LINK ARMS. WITH OUR BROTHERS

01:05:12.008 --> 01:05:13.709

01:05:13.776 --> 01:05:17.380
AGAINST THIS PERNICIOUS WEED

01:05:17.446 --> 01:05:19.915
CALLED HATE AND ON BEHALF OF

01:05:19.982 --> 01:05:22.652
THE SO MANY JEWISH AMERICANS

01:05:22.718 --> 01:05:25.021
WITH WHOM I REPRESENT IN SENATE

01:05:25.087 --> 01:05:27.957
DISTRICT THIRTY. I ASK FOR YOUR

01:05:28.024 --> 01:05:28.924
AYE VOTE ON AS C. R. TWENTY

01:05:28.991 --> 01:05:35.831
NINE. SENATOR BURGESS. THANK

01:05:35.898 --> 01:05:38.668
YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. I THINK A

01:05:38.734 --> 01:05:41.504
LOT HAS BEEN SAID TODAY. SOME

01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:44.740
VERY TOUCHING STORIES. IN A FEW

01:05:44.807 --> 01:05:48.110
WEEKS WE'RE GOING TO BE-

01:05:48.177 --> 01:05:50.246
COMMEMORATING THE ANNIVERSARY

01:05:50.313 --> 01:05:53.215
OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE APRIL

01:05:53.282 --> 01:05:53.816
TWENTY FOUR THE REASON I BRING

01:05:53.883 --> 01:05:58.688
THAT UP. IS BECAUSE NGUYEN

01:05:58.754 --> 01:06:01.090
ATROCITIES WENT UNANSWERED. IT

01:06:01.157 --> 01:06:06.362
FACILITATED INSPIRED. OTHERS TO

01:06:06.429 --> 01:06:08.698
RE COMMIT ATROCITIES SUCH AS

01:06:08.764 --> 01:06:10.900
THE ONES THAT WERE EXPERIENCE

01:06:10.966 --> 01:06:11.467
DURING WORLD WAR TWO IN THE

01:06:11.534 --> 01:06:14.337
HOLOCAUST. THERE WAS A FAMOUS

01:06:14.403 --> 01:06:18.441
QUOTE BY ADOLF HITLER- AFTER

01:06:18.507 --> 01:06:21.877
THE OTTOMAN TURKS HAD- KILLED

01:06:21.944 --> 01:06:23.646
THE ARMENIANS AND THE GREEKS IN

01:06:23.713 --> 01:06:26.515
THE ASSYRIANS TO THE TUNE OF

01:06:26.582 --> 01:06:29.318
OVER A COUPLE OF MILLION PEOPLE.

01:06:29.385 --> 01:06:31.120
WHO AFTER ALL REMEMBERS THE

01:06:31.187 --> 01:06:34.090
ARMENIANS. THAT I THINK IS VERY

01:06:34.156 --> 01:06:39.362
TELLING. THAT A STATEMENT BY A

01:06:39.428 --> 01:06:42.832
MONSTER LIKE THE FORMER LEADER

01:06:42.898 --> 01:06:46.969
OF GERMANY OF THE RIGHT. WOULD

01:06:47.036 --> 01:06:48.304
USE THAT AS AN EXAMPLE IN

01:06:48.371 --> 01:06:50.439
JUSTIFICATION THAT HE COULD

01:06:50.506 --> 01:06:52.274
COMMIT SUCH ATROCITIES AND

01:06:52.341 --> 01:06:53.642
NEVER BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR

01:06:53.709 --> 01:06:56.679
THEM. I THINK WHAT'S INSPIRING

01:06:56.746 --> 01:06:59.782
NOT ONLY IS WE HONOR THOSE THAT

01:06:59.849 --> 01:07:02.051
PERISHED DURING THE HOLOCAUST.

01:07:02.118 --> 01:07:03.352
IS THAT WE ALSO MAKE CERTAIN

01:07:03.419 --> 01:07:06.355
THAT WE- REMIND OURSELVES HOW

01:07:06.422 --> 01:07:08.824
EASILY THESE THINGS CAN HAPPEN

01:07:08.891 --> 01:07:11.961
AGAIN. AND HOW THEY HAVE IN THE

01:07:12.027 --> 01:07:13.462
LAST SEVENTY YEARS IN DIFFERENT

01:07:13.529 --> 01:07:16.332
PARTS OF THE WORLD. YOU TAKE A

01:07:16.399 --> 01:07:17.533
LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:21.404
XINJIANG. CHINA IN THE

01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:23.973
NORTHWESTERN PORTION AND THE

01:07:24.039 --> 01:07:25.875
CCP'S POLICIES TOWARD THE WEEK

01:07:25.941 --> 01:07:28.778
OR- AND THE DETENTION OF

DURING THE TENURE OF SENATOR

01:25:33.394 --> 01:25:35.697

01:25:40.768 --> 01:25:41.236
YOU NEED A LOT OF HELP AND

01:25:41.302 --> 01:25:44.739
MENTORING JIM WAS GREAT AT THAT.

01:25:44.806 --> 01:25:45.707

CHAMBER. HE COULD PASS IN YOUR

01:25:56.551 --> 01:25:59.654
MIND BECAUSE- WHEN THIS CHAMBER

01:25:59.721 --> 01:26:02.090
WAS DESIGNATED AS AS EARTHQUAKE

01:26:02.156 --> 01:26:05.894
VULNERABLE. MUCH DEBATE WENT ON

01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:08.630
IS WHAT DO WE DO. AND A COUNTER

01:26:08.696 --> 01:26:11.499
PROPOSAL TO RESTORING THIS

01:26:11.566 --> 01:26:12.934
BEAUTIFUL BUILDING WAS

01:26:19.207 --> 01:26:21.643
NOT PREVAIL ENGINE BEING

01:26:21.709 --> 01:26:24.445
ASSISTED IS HISTORIAN INSISTED

01:26:24.512 --> 01:26:26.948
THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO

01:26:27.015 --> 01:26:29.984
RESTORE THIS CHAMBER. THERE

01:26:30.051 --> 01:26:30.585
WERE CONCERNS THAT THERE WOULD

01:26:30.652 --> 01:26:34.589
NOT BE. THE PEOPLE WHO COULD DO

01:26:34.656 --> 01:26:36.658
THIS KIND OF WORK THE TECHNICAL

01:26:36.724 --> 01:26:40.762
WORK. THE CAREFUL WOULD WORK

01:26:40.828 --> 01:26:44.532
REQUIRED TO EMULATE THE CAPITAL.

01:26:44.599 --> 01:26:47.769
THE ORIGINAL CAPITAL. AND I

01:26:47.835 --> 01:26:48.870

01:26:48.937 --> 01:26:50.371
CAPITAL OF PAINTING PICTURE IN

01:26:50.438 --> 01:26:53.675
MY OFFICE. JIM WAS INSISTENT

01:26:53.741 --> 01:26:56.844
ABOUT THAT. AND THAT BEING THE

01:26:56.911 --> 01:26:58.880
CASE THIS IS WHAT WE GET TO

01:26:58.947 --> 01:27:02.283
ENJOY. I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW IT

01:27:02.350 --> 01:27:04.352
WOULD BE DIFFERENT. TODAY AND

01:27:04.419 --> 01:27:05.920
MORE FOR THE STERILE FACILITY

01:27:05.987 --> 01:27:08.256
THEY MIGHT BE VERY NICE MAYBE

01:27:08.323 --> 01:27:10.425
SOME MORE AMENITIES. BUT THIS

01:27:10.491 --> 01:27:13.061
IS HISTORY. AND THIS IS

01:27:13.127 --> 01:27:15.964
SOMETHING THAT I WOULD ARGUE

01:27:16.030 --> 01:27:16.531
THAT WE ALL OF PAYMENT MORE

01:27:16.598 --> 01:27:20.168
ATTENTION TO. GEN BEING A

01:27:20.234 --> 01:27:22.403
HISTORIAN AND A MAGNIFICENT

01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:25.607
WRITER ABOUT HISTORY. DID CARE

01:27:25.673 --> 01:27:30.244
ABOUT WHAT WENT ON HERE BEFORE.

01:27:30.311 --> 01:27:32.347
WHEN I CAME BACK AFTER EIGHTEEN

01:27:32.413 --> 01:27:33.715
YEARS HIATUS PEOPLE SAID JIM

01:27:33.781 --> 01:27:35.116
WHAT'S DIFFERENT NOW THAN

01:27:35.183 --> 01:27:37.218
BEFORE I SAID WELL.

01:27:37.285 --> 01:27:39.120
COLLEGIALITY IS DIMINISHED

01:27:39.187 --> 01:27:42.323
GOING FOR EACH OTHER. AND A

01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:45.026
REVERENCE FOR THE PAST OR EVEN

01:27:45.093 --> 01:27:47.028
A CURIOSITY ABOUT IT. HAS

01:27:47.095 --> 01:27:49.764
DIMINISHED. AND THAT'S NOT

01:27:49.831 --> 01:27:54.836
HELPFUL. SO AS WE ADDRESS BILLS.

01:27:54.902 --> 01:27:56.404
DURING THIS YEAR OF FOR ME AT

01:27:56.471 --> 01:27:59.974
LEAST IT IS VAN. MEMBERS COME

01:28:00.041 --> 01:28:01.476
UP WITH LEGISLATION AND THAT

01:28:01.542 --> 01:28:02.744
WAS THE BRIGHT LIGHT THAT WENT

01:28:02.810 --> 01:28:04.445
ON AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

01:28:04.512 --> 01:28:05.880
WE'VE EVER TALKED ABOUT IT AND

01:28:05.947 --> 01:28:08.316
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA. WELL

01:28:08.383 --> 01:28:09.651
THERE'S VERY LITTLE NEW UNDER

01:28:09.717 --> 01:28:12.620
THE SUN HERE. JIM KNEW THAT.

01:28:12.687 --> 01:28:14.222
ANY GOOD COACH PEOPLE ABOUT

01:28:14.288 --> 01:28:16.190
WELL WHAT WENT ON BEFORE SO

01:28:16.257 --> 01:28:17.392
THEY MIGHT LEARN FROM THE

01:28:17.458 --> 01:28:19.994
PRIOR. LEGISLATION THAT HAD

01:28:20.061 --> 01:28:21.829
BEEN HERE. AND PARTICULARLY

01:28:21.896 --> 01:28:24.165
KNOWING AND THE REFERENCE TO

01:28:24.232 --> 01:28:26.401
THE RULES OF THE HOUSE OF THE

01:28:26.467 --> 01:28:29.537
INSTITUTION. I'VE ALWAYS BEEN

01:28:29.604 --> 01:28:30.104
IN THE MINORITY PARTY AROUND

01:28:30.171 --> 01:28:33.374
HERE. WE GOT AS CLOSE AS

01:28:33.441 --> 01:28:36.878
SIXTEEN ONE TIME. BUT I

01:28:36.944 --> 01:28:41.249
REALIZED THAT THE PROTESTS.

01:28:41.315 --> 01:28:45.153
THEY ALSO HAD. A SENSE OF THEIR

01:28:45.219 --> 01:28:47.488
OWN HISTORY. THAT THEY WERE THE

01:28:47.555 --> 01:28:51.426
PRO TEM. OF ALL THE MEMBERS OF

01:28:51.492 --> 01:28:55.463
THE SENATE. AND THIS

01:28:55.530 --> 01:28:57.999
INSTITUTION IS ALWAYS HAD A

01:28:58.066 --> 01:28:58.499
TRADITION OF BEING LESS

01:28:58.566 --> 01:29:02.203
PARTNERS. IN ITS COMPARTMENT.

01:29:02.270 --> 01:29:06.074
THEN THE STATE ASSEMBLY. KIM

01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:07.975

01:29:15.450 --> 01:29:18.486
PILOT. ANOTHER WAS CALLED THE

01:29:18.553 --> 01:29:22.056
DISORDERLY HOUSE. IT WAS KIND

01:29:22.123 --> 01:29:24.092
OF A POKE AT THE STATE ASSEMBLY.

01:29:24.158 --> 01:29:25.993

01:29:35.803 --> 01:29:38.072
DIFFERENT. AND THE COMPORTMENT

01:29:38.139 --> 01:29:40.475
IS DIFFERENT. ORDER THE SIMPLE

01:29:40.541 --> 01:29:42.810
REASONS IS THERE MORE MEMBERS

01:29:42.877 --> 01:29:44.679
OF THAT HOUSE THAN THIS ONE.

01:29:44.746 --> 01:29:48.182
BUT THERE ARE ALSO TRADITIONS.

01:29:48.249 --> 01:29:50.351
AND THERE ARE WORDS TO DESCRIBE

01:29:50.418 --> 01:29:53.054

ABUSIVELY. MORE STATE. BUT YET

01:30:28.756 --> 01:30:29.290
