SERIES OF SIX HEARINGS THAT WE WILL HOLD FOR ASSEMBLY BILLS WE HAVE THIRTY BILLS ON TODAY'S AGENDA BUT DO NOT BE AFRAID -- MANY OF THEM ARE ON CONSENT. AB SEVEN OH THREE BY DOCTOR WEBER HAS BEEN PULLED OVER BY THE COMMITTEE FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION. AB SEVEN TEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER CERVANTES HAS BEEN PULLED BY THE AUTHOR AND WE HAVE NINETEEN ITEMS ON CONSENT WILL BE LIMITING TESTIMONY TO TWO PEOPLE PER SIDE AND TWO MINUTES PER PERSON. OTHER WITNESSES MAY STATE THEIR NAME ORGANIZATION AB POSITION AND NO OTHER TESTIMONY WILL BE LOUD. WE DO NOT HAVE A QUORUM SO WE WILL START AS A SUB COMMITTEE AND I SEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA COMMON FORWARD PLEASE. GOOD MORNING SIR BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. BUT TODAY I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB FIVE FOURTEEN WHICH WOULD CREATE A STEP. ENABLING A NEW STUDENT CHRISTY. TO BE A FULLY EMPOWERED VOTING MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES. BEGINNING ON THEIR FIRST YEAR OF APPOINTMENT. IN THE TIME BETWEEN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE AND NINETEEN NINETY NINE THE STUDENT POPULATION HAS GROWN TO OVER. THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOUBLING THE STUDENT POPULATION IN THE CALENDAR STATE A CALIFORNIA. STATE UNIVERSITY. THE STUDENT POPULATION IS MUCH MORE DIVERSE NOW AND THAT DIVERSITY REQUIRES THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES PRESENTED THROUGH THE VOTE OF THE TRUSTEES. THE STUDENT TRUSTEE EXERCISES A CRUCIAL ROLE OF REPRESENTING ALL STUDENTS ON THE CSU BOARD OF TRUSTEES. AB FIVE FOURTEEN IS SIMPLE AND REASONABLE STEP THAT SEEKS TO RATIONALLY INCREASE THE POWER OF THE STUDENT VOICE ON THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES. WITH ME TODAY IS ONE GARCIA. IS STARTING HIS SECOND YEAR AS A STUDENT BOARD OF TRUSTEE. WILL BE THE INCOMING VOTING STUDENT. ALSO MY YOU'RE GOOD AT ALL -- EXPECTING FROM THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION. THIS BILL HAS RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND WHEN YOU HAVE A QUORUM I WILL RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE VERY GOOD THANK YOU SIR WELCOME PLEASE PROCEED. THE MORNING COMMUTER LEYVA AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS ONE GARCIA I'M A STUDENT AT CAL POLY POMONA AND THE CURRENT NONVOTING SU INTEREST THE FOR THE CSU WERE CHRISTIE'S AT LEAST FOR A FEW MORE WEEKS. I'M THANKFUL TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER AS WELL AS THE KELSEY SINICIZATION FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP IN OFFERING AB. FIVE FOURTEEN AS YOU ALL KNOW THE CSU BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE CRITICAL BODY FOR ISSUES RELATED TO STUDENTS SHE'S LIKE TUITION CURRICULUM ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS AND INFRASTRUCTURE. ALL FALL UNDER THE PURVIEW OF THE BOARD. THIS IS WHY HAVING ADEQUATE STUDENT REPRESENTATION ON THE BOARD IS VITALLY IMPORTANT TO ENSURE STUDENT VOICES ARE TRULY CONSIDERED AND CAN INFLUENCE THESE IMPORTANT DISCUSSIONS. CURRENTLY WHILE THERE ARE TWO STUDENT TRUSTEES ONLY ONE CAN VOTE. THIS PAST YEAR AS THE NONVOTING CENTRICITY I ATTENDED ALL BOARD MEETINGS AND FUNCTIONS AS WELL AS ALL CSSA BOARD MEETINGS. AND WORKED AS HARD AS I COULD TO REPRESENT THE STUDENT VOICE. HOWEVER. WHEN IT CAME TO FUNCTIONALLY INFLUENCING THESE IMPORTANT POLICY CONVERSATIONS? I WAS NOT ABLE TO VOTE. AS AN EXAMPLE THIS YEAR I WAS ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL OF BOARD MEMBERS WHO ATTENDED ALL CSU PRESIDENTIAL HIRING MEETINGS FOR POSITIONS I CAST A HUMBLED. SAN FRANCISCO STATE HEALTHY SAN MARCUS AND CAL STATE FULLERTON LETME TELL YOU SOME OF THOSE WERE FOURTEEN HOUR DAYS. THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT AB FIVE FOURTEEN WILL FIX AS A REALLY BRIEF HISTORICAL REFERENCE AND AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED CSU STUDENTS ADVOCATED IN THE SEVENTIES OR REPRESENTATION ON THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES. THEY RECEIVED THROUGH STATE LEGISLATION IS THE INTERESTING. THE NEXT TWENTY FIVE YEARS STUDENTS AT ONE VOICE AND ONE VOTE ON THE BOARD. IN THE LATE NINETIES STUDENT LEADERS ADVOCATED FOR THE NEED FOR MORE REPRESENTATION ON THE BOARD. THE SURVIVALIST IN A DOUBLE BECOME MORE DIVERSE WITH NEW CAMPUS IS OPENING. TWO INDIVIDUALS WASN'T ONE WITH -- AND ONE WITHOUT A VOTE FOR THE NECESSARY BY THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR TO REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED STUDENTS [inaudible] NOW. THE CITY POPULATION HAS GROWN BY NEARLY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS AND IT'S FAIRLY NEW CAMPUS AT CSU CHANNEL ISLANDS HAS BEEN OPENED AND OUR STUDENT POPULATION IS INCREDIBLY MORE DIVERSE. IT'S AN ASSEMBLY VEST WITHIN THE SECOND STUDENTS ALL THE RIGHTS PRIVILEGES AND RESPONSIBILITIES GIVEN TO ALL OTHER BOARD MEMBERS AND IN PARTICULAR THE RIGH TO VOTE. ADDITIONALLY I WOULD KNOW THE STUDENTS ARE IN A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY UNAVAILABLE TO ANY OTHER GROUP TO MAKE THIS IMPORTANT GAME. SIMPLY GIVING THE NON VOTING TRUSTEE THE ABILITY TO VOTE DOES NOT CHANGE THE STATE APPOINTMENTS PROCESS WOULD REQUIRE NO NEW FUNDS TO THE STATE. AS I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY EVEN THOUGH I AM THE NONVOTING TRISTEN I'VE ATTENDED LIKEALL MY PREDECESSORS ALL BOARD MEETINGS AND FUNCTIONS AND I'VE WORKED HARD TO UNDERSTAND THIS IN PERSPECTIVE. ON ISSUES AND BE A FAIR AND ACCURATE REPRESENTATIVE ON THE WITH THE PASSAGE OF AB FIVE FOURTEEN FUTURE STUDENTS IN MY SITUATION WILL SIMPLY BE ABLE TO VOTE ON THIS MATTER. AND LASTLY I WOULD NOTE THAT OUR FRIENDS IN THE CSU STATE WHY I CAN BE SENATE AS WELL AS BE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION. SUPPORT THIS BILL AS PRESENTED AS THE RESPECT THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL AGENCY FOR STUDENTS AT THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES. AB FIVE FOURTEEN REPRESENTS A MODEST AND LOGICAL NEXT STEP TO STUDENT REPRESENTATION ANSWERED GOVERNANCE WITHIN THE CSE. WE BELIEVE IT IS TIME TO TRULY RESPECT AND HONOR THE SENATE LEADERS WHO TAKE ON THIS GREAT RESPONSIBILITY AND ALLOW THEM TO REPRESENT HOLY THE NEARLY HALF A MILLION STUDENTS IN THE CSU. SO WE HOPE YOU CAN SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS AND SUPPORT AB. FIVE FORTY THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD JOB ON THOSE LONG DAYS AND LISTENING AND BEING AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT.

WHY NOT HAVE A SECOND ALUMNI TRUSTEE -- AND SO I KNOW THAT IT TO IN THE BROADER CONTEXT ARE WE JUST PICKING A SPOT BUT I DO THINK THAT -- THE STUDENTS ARE WHY WE'RE HERE -- WHY WE DO WHAT WE DO? AND AND I THINK THAT -- IT'S A IT'S A IT'S AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO SEND -- TO THE TRUSTEES AND EVERYONE THAT THE STUDENTS VOICE IS VERY VALUED AND AND WE SHOULD LOOK FOR EVERY POSSIBLE AVENUE.

AND OTHER APPRENTICESHIP AN INTERNSHIP TRAINING PROGRAMS WITHOUT HAVING TO ENROLL IN THE DOCK A PROGRAM. CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES OFFER A WIDE ARRAY OF PROGRAMS THAT REQUIRE PARTICIPATION IN AN APPRENTICESHIP FOR INTERNSHIP PROGRAM. HOWEVER MANY OF THOSE PROGRAMS REQUIRE STUDENTS TO HAVE A VALID SOCIAL SECURITY. NUMBER. WHICH PREVENTS UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS WHO DO NOT QUALIFY FROM FOR DHAKA FROM ENTERING THESE PROGRAMS. FOR YOU COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRANCERS OFFICE ESTIMATES THAT UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS MAKE UP FIFTY TO SEVENTY THOUSAND OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE POPULATION. THE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER REQUIREMENT ISN'T IT POSSIBLE OBSTACLE FOR UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS WHO DO NOT QUALIFY FOR DOCTOR. THE IRS ISSUES INDIVIDUAL TAX IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS TO INDIVIDUALS.

COLLEGES BEING THAT IT'S SUCH AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. NOT ONLY BECAUSE I AM A CHANCE ON A CORNER AND MY COLLEGE BUT ALSO BECAUSE I AM THE ADVISER OF THE A DOCUMENT SETTING A REALIZATION ON CAMPUS SO. I SEE MYSELF AS AN ADVOCATE IN. MY SETTING -- I BELIEVE THAT AS COMMITTEE COLLEGES. IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO HAVE ACCESS BUT TO ENGAGE OUR STUDENTS IN A REAL WAY AND FOR ME THIS BILL. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE FACULTY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE CALL JUST TO SUPPORT A. B.. FIVE NINETY FIVE BECAUSE I THINK THAT IT'S AN ABSOLUTE IMPORTANT BILL. DIED BEYOND ACCESS ALLOWS OUR STUDENTS. TO ENGAGE IN PROGRAMS THAT REQUIRE A PRINT AND SHIP OR INTERNSHIP PROGRAM SUCH AS THE KOREAN TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS ALLIED HEALTH.

AND QUITE HONESTLY WE IN CALIFORNIA REAL GOOD AT CREATING OUR OWN. A GROWING OUR OWN SORT OF TALENTED STUDENTS AND I THINK IT'S A SHAME TO NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE THEM. ENGAGE IN THE PROGRAMS THAT THEY CARE ABOUT AND THAT THEY WOULD BE REALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT. AND LET'S BE HONEST TO REPRESENT THEM IN THE COMMUNITIES OF THE CORRUPTION I THINK THAT WOULD BE A SHAME FOR CALIFORNIA NOT TO BE ABLE TOALLOW. OUR OWN STUDENTS THAT WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME AND FOR THESE FIELDS TO TO ENGAGE IN THE SCOTT CAREERS. AS YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF DHAKA BEING ON HOLD AS OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE'RE GOING BACK TO THOSE DAYS AND I THINK THAT IN CALIFORNIA I'M VERY PROUD TO BE A CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COLLEGE EDUCATED WERE ALWAYS AT THE FOREFRONT. AND I WANTED TO CONTINUE BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT WE NEED TO BE THAT EXAMPLE. I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD I WOULD SAY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO BE ABLE -- TO ADVOCATE FOR STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA -- OBVIOUSLY THE HUGE BENEFIT IS THAT THIS FIFTY THOUSAND STUDENTS THAT ARE IN OUR SYSTEM -- GET. TO PURSUE WHATEVER IT ADD CAREER THEY WANT AND GET BACK TO OUR OWN COMMUNITIES BY BEING IN THIS IN THESE FIELDS. WHICH WITH THAT SO DESPERATELY NEED LAST TIME I CHECKED WERE STILL NEED GREAT TEACHERS WE STILL NEED MORE HEALTH EDUCATORS YOU KNOW. AND WE WE WITH THIS IS A GREAT WAY FOR US TO CONTINUE THAT.

THAT STUDENTS ON TOP OF SOMETHING ELSE ON TOP OF SOMETHING ELSE SO A LOT OF A ESOS JUST DIDN'T GO THROUGH WITH IT CLARIFIED THAT'S YOU SO SHOULD STUDENTS. EACH INDIVIDUAL CHANGE AND I WAS THE NUMBERS IN THE IN THE IN THE LETTERS TO CHANGE. SO I I HAVE TO SAY THAT -- I FIND THIS A REQUIREMENTS I GUESS IT'S A STATE REQUIREMENT OF THE AVERAGE OF THREE ELECTIONS. TO BE RIDICULOUS. I MEAN THINK OF WE DID THAT FOR OUR ELECTIONS OKAY -- IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THAT SOME WOULD SAY WAS VERY CONSEQUENTIAL 60% OF AMERICANS DIDN'T VOTE. AND IF YOU LOOK AT OUR SENATE ELECTIONS YESTERDAY. MY GUESS IS THE TURNOUT IN THOSE ELECTIONS WOULD NEVER HAVE PASSED THE REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE PUTTING ON OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. AND SOMEONE A FLAG THAT IS WHAT I THINK IS AN UNFAIR. REQUIREMENT TO CREATE A EVEN GREATER BURDEN ON WHAT YOU WANT TO ACCOMPLISH IN TERMS OF YOUR ORGANIZATION OF THE CAMPUSES AND I HOPE THAT. WITH THE ESTEEMED AN EXPERIENCE LEADER ON THIS BILL -- SO INVOLVED IN THESE ISSUES THAT PERHAPS WE CAN WORK ON THAT -- IN THE FUTURE BUT I I THINK THIS IS A GOOD BILL YOU DO PROVIDE AN OPT OUT FOR STUDENTS AND IT'S A AND THAT'S THE MAMMOTH THAT THE STAFF FAST FOR YOU TO ACCEPT AND I THINK IT'S A GOOD. ONE BUT I DO THINK THAT YOU SHOULD BE EMPOWERED TO AND SAID THESE BARRIERS SHOULD COME DOWN. AND I'M VERY COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH YOU TO TRY TO ACCOMPLISH THAT.

AT RISK IS A STIGMATIZED LABEL USED TO DESCRIBE STUDENTS THAT LIVE IN DIFFICULT SITUATIONS HAVE CREATED AN EXPECTATION OF FAILURE. BY FOCUSING ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF USED BECOMING ANOTHER STATISTIC. THIS IS A MINDSET THAT IS ALL TOO PERVASIVE AND OUR SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES AS A STATE WE NEED TO BE MORE AWARE OF THE MESSAGE THIS LANGUAGE FANS. AT RISK NOT ONLY INFLUENCES TEACHERS EXPECTATION BUT ALSO THE CONFIDENCE OF THOSE STUDENTS AND HOW MUCH THEY BELIEVE IN THEMSELVES. THIS IS A LABEL THAT SHOULD NOT BE USED TO DESCRIBE THE POTENTIAL OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE YOUTH [inaudible] WORDS MATTER. LET'S BE INTENTIONAL WITHOUT LANGUAGE AND EMPOWER OUR STUDENTS IN THE SAME WAY RESPECT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES BY USING PEOPLE FIRST LANGUAGE.

EDUCATORS FROM ACROSSTHE COUNTRY IS THAT IS THAT WORDS MATTER AND THAT AT WROTE AT RISK HAS. HAD A DEEP AND NEGATIVE HISTORY OF WE'VE LOOKED AT WE'VE CALLED STUDENTS CULTURALLY DEPRIVED IN DEFICIENT DISADVANTAGED NOW AT RISK. THE THIS FOCUSES ON DEFICITS AND MINIMIZES THE POTENTIAL OF LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND PEOPLE OF COLOR THE FOCUS ON DEFICITS LOWERS EXPECTATIONS AND LOWERED EXPECTATIONS LEADS TO FAILURE AND DISENGAGEMENT. AT PROMISE FOCUSES ON AN INDIVIDUAL'S POTENTIAL DR VICTOR RIO SAID ARE YOU SEE SB LARRY BELL THEM ALL TO CULTURAL -- AMERICA AND MANY OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY ADVOCATE THE USE OF POSITIVE LABELING STRATEGIES TO GAIN. DRAMATIC INCREASES IN STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT. I'M CHANGING THE DESIGNATION WE PLACE IN STATUTE FROM AT RISK TO A PROMISE IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS EQUITY IN EDUCATION.

WELL AS YOU KNOW -- AS IDENTIFIED IN THE ANALYSIS THERE'S NUMEROUS PROGRAMS THAT CONSISTED OF THE LANGUAGE AT RISK MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS WHEN THEY ARE IN PLACE WE USE FLYERS OR POSTERS FOR THE EVENTS. AND OTHERS -- COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER-ORGANIZATIONS WILL ALSO USE FLYERS -- AND PUT POSTERS UP A AT THE EVENTS WHILE I ATTENDED ONE OF THESE EVENTS AND I WAS VOLUNTEERING FOR AND I SAW A POSTER AT THE WELCOMING DOORS WHERE ALL THE CHILDREN OF PARTICIPANTS WERE WALKING TROUGH. AND THE POSTER SAID IT WAS TO BENEFIT THE PROGRAM WAS TO BENEFIT AT RISK YOUTH. AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF WELL WHAT OF THE CHILDREN WHO ARE HERE WHO STRUGGLED HAVE CHALLENGING LIVES. WHO HAVE COME TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM TO RECEIVE ALL THE SERVICES AND RESOURCES THAT WE WERE PROVIDING THEM WHAT WOULD THAT FEEL LIKE TO THEM? AND IF WE ONLY CHANGE THE WORDS TO A PROGRAM BENEFITING AT PROMISE YOU. THAT COULD MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE SO IT'S NOT JUST A CHANGE IN THE LAW TO A CHANGE IN HOW WE VIEW THESE CHILDREN. AND CHANGING THE CODE FOR ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS WILL NOT ONLY -- DO THAT BUT IT WILL ALSO IMPACT THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF EACH OF THOSE PROGRAMS IDENTIFIED IN THE ANALYSIS SO FOR THESE REASONS WE STRONGLY URGE I'VE FELT.

AND WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE STRENGTHS AND THEIR ASSETS AND WE SPEND A LOT TIME TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF ASSET BASED APPROACHES AND I SEE THAT YOUR BILL IS. ALONG THE SIDE CERTAINLY IT'S NOT A PANACEA TO EVERYTHING BUT HOPEFULLY IT SIGNALS AND THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF LOOKING AT EVERYONE. AS AN ASSET EVERYONE HAS SOMETHING THEY CAN CONTRIBUTE.

GREAT JOB ON BREVITY A BIRTHDAY BOY OUR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT PLEASE PROCEED. HELLO MEMBERS A COMMITTEE AND CHAIR -- MONEY IS RICHARD HANSON AND YOU TEACH I TAUGHT AT THE END THE COLLEGE -- I'M RETIRED NOW BUT I HAVE ENCOUNTERED THIS ISSUE OVER MANY YEARS -- IT WAS MY DISTRICT THAT HAD SOME TROUBLE. ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO -- THAT WE WENT TO FACT WITH WHERE THE DISTRICT DIDN'T WANT TO ACCEPT -- TRANSFER OF SICKLY FROM A PART TIME FACULTY MEMBER. AND AT THAT POINT -- K. TWELVE AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAD THE SAME AD CODE LANGUAGE. OKAY CALLS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT WORLD FROM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES IT WAS A YOUNG ONE YEAR ANDMOST K. TWELVE JOBS YOU KNOW OUR FULL TIME. AND YOU OF WOULD TRANSFER COMPLETELY FROM ONE DISTRICT TO ANOTHER -- AND WE SHALL AND AND WITHIN A YEAR YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TRANSFER YOUR SICK LEAVE AND NOT STILL IS THE WAY IT IS FOR K.. TWELVE BUT OUR PART TIME FACULTY OF A HARD TIME WITH THAT -- BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE FULL TIME JOBS AND A TRAVEL AMONG MANY DISTRICTS OFTEN. AND FRANKLY NEVER REALLY KNOW WHEN THEY'RE NO LONGER HIRED IN A DISTRICT OR WHEN THEY AT WORK WHEN THEY REALLY COMPLETELY TERMINATED. THEY COULD MAYBE NOT AN pSUDDENLY BE CALLED BACK IF THERE'S A NEED BECAUSE THEIR NAME IS STILL IN THE POOL. SO THE WE WERE HOPING TO GET -- A MORE REASONABLE TIME LIMIT -- WE WERE -- WORKING TOWARD A FIVE YEAR LIMIT WITH -- ARE LEGISLATION AT THAT TIME. AND ENDED UP WITH A THREE AND SO. THE IDEA ABOUT THAT SORT OF A TIME LIMIT WAS THAT IF THERE WERE REEMPLOYMENT RIGHTS ON A CAMPUS FOR A PART TIME FACULTY MEMBER. THAT BY FIVE YEARS THAT THEY DEFINITELY WOULD HAVE LOST THEM IF THEY HAD NOT HAD CONTINUOUS SERVICE. THREE MAYBE THAT'S A LITTLE DICEY -- BUT THAT'S WHAT WE ENDED UP WITH. SINCE THAT TIME. DISTRICT SEVEN TO REPORTED THIS LAW. IN MANY MANY DIFFERENT WAYS STILL DENYING TRANSFER OF SICK LEAVE UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES SOME HOLD TO A HARD A THREE YEAR RULE OTHERS THINK THAT NO THAT'S REALLY AS LONG AS YOU'RE STILL STILL WORKING AT THERE'S NO BREAK IN SERVICE. IN THE SYSTEM YOU YOU'RE OKAY SO WE NEEDED TO JUST CLEAR THIS UP. OF THE BOTTOM LINE ON THIS IS HE HAD WITH CAL STIRS IS THAT. WHEN YOU RETIRE AND EVEN WHILE YOU'RE STILL WORKING SICKLY Và SOMETHING YOU EARN IT'S A AND IT DOES END UP IN RETIREMENT POTENTIALLY BEING A BENEFIT -- WHERE YOU GET SOME SERVICE CREDIT FOR YOUR UNUSED SICK LEAVE? SO -- REALLY ON BEHALF OF THE PART TIME FACULTY -- WE WANTED TO PRESS FOR ELIMINATING ANY TIME LIMIT -- AND I'VE EXPLAINED WHY THAT IS THEY JUST NEVER KNOW REALLY WHEN THEY'VE TERMINATED WITH ANY PARTICULAR DISTRICT. SO -- THE ONLY THING OTHER THING I WOULD ADD IS THAT BACK -- WHEN WE WERE DOING THE EARLIER BILL AT ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST IT WAS THAT DISTRICTS DON'T KEEP THESE RECORDS? BUT IN MY RETIREMENT I WENT TO ALL THE DISTRICTS I HAD WORKED IN -- MY EARLIEST ONE I GOT US A CHANCE TO START TEACHING IN K. TWELVE AT CRENSHAW HIGH SCHOOL IN LA UNIFIED ON AN EMERGENCY CREDENTIAL BECAUSE THEY WERE SO DESPERATE FOR MATH TEACHERS. SO THAT'S WHERE I GOT MY START. THAT WAS BACK IN THE MID EIGHTIES AND I WENT GOT MY MASTERS DEGREE IN AND UP AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. BUT THEY HAD MY RECORDS. THIRTY YEARS AGO THEY WERE ON MICROFICHE. BUT THEY HAD THEM. AND LA UNIFIED GETS A BAD RAP BUT I'M VERY PROUD TO SPENDING MY TIME THERE IN K.. TWELVE SO -- THEY DID IT OTHER DISTRICTS CAN DO IT AND I REALLY URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BILL IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT FOR OUR PART TIME FACULTY IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

MORNING THEN SIR PLEASE PROCEED WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THANK YOU VERY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES HER SENATORS I SHOULD SAY SCHOOL BASED HEALTH SERVICES PLAY A KEY ROLE IN ENSURING THAT CALIFORNIA STUDENTS ARE SAFE AND READY TO LEARN. SINCE THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES K&lt;c.cyan&gt; THROUGH TWELVE&lt;/c&gt; SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR DIRECT HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDED AT SCHOOL SITES. THROUGH SCHOOL BASED HEALTH PROGRAMS INCLUDING FOR EXAMPLE THE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCY MEDI CAL BILLING OPTION PROGRAM. DUE TO A RECENT FEDERAL CHANGE THE ELLIE A BILLING OPTION PROGRAM THAT USED TO BE ONLY AVAILABLE FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS WILL BE OPEN TO ALL MEDI CAL ELIGIBLE STUDENTS. THIS CHANGE WOULD ALLOW FOR MANY MORE ELIGIBLE STUDENTS TO RECEIVE HEALTH SERVICES AT SCHOOL INCLUDING HEALTH EVALUATIONS PHYSICIAN SERVICES AND MENTAL HEALTH AND COUNSELING SERVICES. WHEN POORLY TREATED HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS CAN HAVE A DEVASTATING IMPACT ON SCHOOL ATTENDANCE BEHAVIOR AND ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT? IN CALIFORNIA THERE IS NO INSTITUTIONALIZE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES WHICH OVERSEES MEDI CAL. AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO COORDINATE VARIOUS HEALTH PROGRAMS AND SERVICES DELIVERED THROUGH SCHOOLS. AB THIRTEEN TWENTY TO ESTABLISH AN OFFICE OF SCHOOL BASED HEALTH PROGRAMS WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. FOR THE PURPOSES OF PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR HEALTH RELATED PROGRAMS ADVISING ON ISSUES RELATED TO THE DELIVERY OF SCHOOL BASED HEALTH AND BE IF YOU'RE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. WITH THE UPCOMING EXPANSION OF ELIGIBILITY TO RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDS FOR SCHOOL BASED HEALTH SERVICES THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR AN OFFICE A SCHOOL BASED HEALTH PROGRAMS. TO PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN ASSISTING SCHOOLS THAT WISH TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE PROGRAMS TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS. INSURING THAT CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS MAY CONTINUE TO RECEIVING HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AT SCHOOL SITES. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE ON A. B. THIRTEEN TWENTY TWO AND WITH ME TODAY. IS BARBER CHRONIC -- FROM THE SACRAMENTO CITY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND TONI TRIGGER -- FROM THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER PLEASE PERCENT WHEN YOU'RE READY GOOD MORNING. YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTEEN TWENTY TWO MY NAME IS BARBARA CHRONIC AND I AM THE FORMER DIRECTOR OF STUDENT SUPPORT AND HEALTH SERVICES. AND SACRAMENTO CITY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT I AM CURRENTLY ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BASED HEALTH ALLIANCE. AND TEACHERS FOR HEALTHY KIDS BOTH ARE PROUD SPONSORS OF A. B.. THIRTEEN TWENTY TWO IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ESTABLISH AN OFFICE OF SCHOOL BASED HEALTH PROGRAMS. AS SOMEONE WHO WORKED IN SCHOOLS TO BRING TWO SILOS. HEALTH AND EDUCATION TOGETHER TO MEET THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS I CAN TELL YOU HOW DIFFICULT THE WORK IS. SCHOOLS ARE NATURALLY SET UP. TO BE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND BILL HEALTH CARE FUNDING STREAMS. AND OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. DOESN'T UNDERSTAND HOW OUR SCHOOLS ARE OFTEN AT THE FRONT LINES FOR ENROLLING KIDS AND HEALTH COVERAGE AND IDENTIFYING STUDENTS WITH SIGNIFICANT HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES. IN MANY RESPECTS THEY DON'T SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE. AB THIRTEEN TWENTY TWO WOULD ADD INFRASTRUCTURE AND CAPACITY AT C. D. E. TO FORGE A STRONGER RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. IN ORDER TO COLLABORATE AND BRING THESE TWO SILOS TOGETHER. HISTORICALLY THIS WORK HAS BEEN THE RESPONIBILITY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES WITHOUT A FORMAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. SCHOOLS WANT AND NEED MORE SUPPORT FROM C. D. AS THEY ADDRESS THE HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO NAVIGATING THE SCHOOL MEDICAID PROGRAMS. THEY NEED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. WITH CD IS UNDERSTANDING OF THE DISTRICTS THEY CAN MORE DIRECTLY ASSIST AND TRAIN DISTRICTS TO CREATE BETTER SYSTEMS FOR CLAIMING REIMBURSEMENT AND ULTIMATELY FUNDING SERVICES FOR STUDENTS. WE KNOW THAT THE FROM THE DATA THAT THERE IS A DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN HEALTH AND POSITIVE EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES. THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME TO CAPITALIZE ON OPPORTUNITIES AND STRENGTHEN CD EASE INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT SCHOOL BASED HEALTH SERVICES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTEEN TWENTY TWO THANK YOU PLEASE PROCEED MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S TONY TO KERO AND THEY HAVE THE CALIFORNIA.

AND IS CONSISTENTLY BELOW 50% FOR UTILIZATION RATES A PREVENTIVE SERVICES FOR CALIFORNIA CHILDREN AND MEDI CAL. IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDS WERE IDENTIFIED. FOR REPAYMENT THIS YEAR TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FROM SCHOOL DISTRICTS. HAD DH CS PROVIDED MORE ADEQUATE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO SCHOOLS AND PROTESTED THE AUDIT FINDINGS SCHOOLS WOULD HAVE AN ADDITIONAL ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR. A MUCH NEEDED MONEY TO SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS. LAST YEAR THE GOVERNOR SIGNED THIRTEEN AB THIRTY ONE NINETY TWO WHAT TRAFFIC IS REFERENCED IN YOUR COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. SCHOOLS REQUIRE CLARITY AND CONSISTENCY IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROGRAM TO APPROPRIATELY BILL FOR THE HEALTH SERVICES THEY PROVIDE. SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE HAD TROUBLE RECEIVING THAT APPROPRIATE GUIDANCE FROM DH CS AND SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE SEIZE PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM BECAUSE OF THESE PROBLEMS. TO RUN SMOOTHLY AND MAX MY FUNDING ELIGIBILITY SCHOOLS REQUIRE SUPPORT FROM STATE AGENCIES RESPONSIBLE FOR BOTH HEALTH. AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS CALIFORNIA HAS NO INSTITUTIONALIZE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO IN THIS CASE DH CS AND CD TO COORDINATE HEALTH PROGRAMS AND SERVICES DELIVERED THROUGH SCHOOLS. CTA BELIEVES THAT AB THIRTY THIRTEEN TWENTY TWO ESTABLISHING AN OFFICE OF SCHOOL BASED HEALTH WILL ASSIST SCHOOLS IN PROVIDING THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. NOT NOW AVAILABLE FROM DH CS THE EXPANSION OF HEALTH CARE'S HEALTH SERVICES LATER THEIR TEACHER WILL ALLOW SCHOOLS PROMOTE HEALTHIER OUTCOMES.
