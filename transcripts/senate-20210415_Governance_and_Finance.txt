I CAN'T SAY THANK YOU ENOUGH. I CENTER STERN HAS BEEN A LEADER JUST LIKE THE VICE CHAIR MISTER NIELSEN ON ALL ISSUES A WILDFIRE HOME HARDENING INSURANCE- AND I'M SO. GRATEFUL TO BE WORKING WITH YOU SIR. WE'RE GOING TO TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO YOU- FOR AN OPENING STATEMENT. THAT I HAVE A FEW WORDS ON S FIFTY FIVE IN PARTNERSHIP PLEASE CENTER STERN THE FORCE OR SERVING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND I'M SORRY I CAN'T BE WITH YOU ALL HERE TODAY- I WANT TO START BY THANKING YOU AND YOUR STAFF. HOW MY AUDIENCE THROUGH OKAY I'M GETTING A LITTLE ECHO ON MY LIST ALL RIGHT YOU'RE SOUNDING GREAT WE DON'T HAVE THE ASK ON OUR END OKAY GOOD. I'M ALL TO MYSELF AT THE END THAT PROBABLY PROVE THINGS SO WHAT IS START BY THINKING- YOU MISTER CHAIR AND YOUR STAFF WERE DIGGING SO DEEP ON THIS ISSUE AND NO WE% DIDN'T- I JUST WENT OUT NAY ANALYSIS WE HAD OVERSIGHT HEARINGS TWO YEARS BACK WE'VE BEEN TRACKING THIS ISSUE FOR MANY YEARS- AND YOUR ATTENTION AND PERSISTENCE. ON FINDING A WAY TO ADDRESS OUR HOUSING CRISIS WITHOUT EXACERBATING THE RISKS OF OUR WILDFIRE CRISIS- ARE UNPRECEDENTED AND IS USUALLY APPRECIATED SO IN LIGHT OF THE EXTENSIVE STAKEHOLDER WORK YOU'VE BEEN DOING- WITH SB TWELVE WHICH WE KNOW PASSED ADDED THIS COMMITTEE EARLIER- THIS MONTH- LATE LAST MONTH- WHAT WE'RE INTENDING TO MAKE SB FIFTY FIVE BUT A TO YOUR BILL TODAY. AND SIGNED ON AS A JOINT AUTHOR- TO S. B. TWELVE- AND HOPEFULLY FIND SOME PARTNERSHIP- GOING FORWARD WHERE ADD THE WHOLE SENATE WILDFIRE PACKAGE AND HOUSING PACKAGE START TO REALIZE THAT S. B. TWELVE- IS A CRITICAL PIECE OF THAT FORMULA. WE FEEL IT FIFTY FIVE HERE TODAY INTENTIONALLY HAS SOME MORE AGGRESSIVE ELEMENTS IN IT- THEN S. B. TWELVE- AND SOME OF THAT MAY MAKE SENSE IN THE FINAL FRAME WORK BUT- E WILL ADD A DIFFERENCE BUT ALSO JUST RESPECT FOR THE LEVEL OF WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE- WE WANNA HARMONIZE THOSE EFFORTS. AND HOPEFULLY GET A BILL THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE AND A SIGNATURE FROM THE GOVERNOR THIS YEAR- AS WE KNOW WE JUST PASSED HISTORIC EARLY ACTION FUNDING ON WILDFIRE PREVENTION- TO HARDENER COMMUNITIES DO A VEGETATION MANAGEMENT TO REDUCE FUEL RISK BUT MONEY ALONE CAN'T SOLVE THIS PROBLEM- WE NEED TO CHANGE THE. WAY WE ARE BUILDING AND ADDRESSING LAN USE IN THE STATE TO. OURSELVES FOR BUILDING DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO VERY HIGH FIRE SEVERITY SOUNDS WITHOUT SUFFICIENT HARDENING- EMERGENCY EVACUATION HAZARD MITIGATION AND OTHER STANDARDS- THERE ABOUT TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS LIVING RIGHT NOW IN VERY HIGH FIRE SEVERITY ZONES. THOSE ARE THE VERY HIGH FIRE SEVERITY ZONES THERE'S MILLIONS MORE LIVING AT HIGH AND MODERATE STONES THAT HAVE ALSO BEEN HIT AS I KNOW YOU KNOW ALL TOO WELL MISTER CHAIR OUT IN. COFFEE PARK IN IN OTHER AREAS THAT NEVER THOUGHT OF THEMSELVES AS A FIRE RISK BUT I WERE HIT NONE THE LESS- SO. YOU KNOW THE BILL TODAY IS INTENDED TO LIMIT THAT DEVELOPMENT IN CASES WHERE SUFFICIENT PLANNING HAS NOT BEEN DONE- WE KNOW THAT THE RESILIENCY EFFORTS AND HARDENING- CAN BE A HUGE FACTOR IN KEEPING HOME STANDING IN THE BUILDING STANDARDS ESPECIALLY APPLYING THEM BEYOND JUST THE VERY HIGH ZONES INTO HIGH AND MODERATE CAN BE. A REALLY EFFECTIVE PREVENTION METHOD AS WELL- BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH OF THE LOSSES WE'VE SEEN IN PROTECTING HOMES IN THESE AREAS OF THE LAST THREE YEARS. HAS BEEN IN THE TENS OF BILLIONS AND OVER THE LAST DECADE- OVER FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS IS SPENT. AND SO WE WANT TO SLOW DOWN THE PACE OF DEVELOPMENT IN THESE VERY HIGH FIRE ZONES WTHOUT HINDERING THE HOUSING CRISIS AND I REALLY WANT TO JUST TAKE A SECOND I WON'T BELABOR THIS BUT I WANT TO THANK THOSE. IN THE HOUSING COMMUNITY- WHETHER IT'S YOU ME OR ABUNDANT HOUSING OR THE OTHERS OF ENGAGE WITH US AND TRY TO FIND A WAY IN THIS BILL TO AT LEAST PUT AN IDEA OUT THERE. ABOUT A DENSITY BONUS- TO ACCOMPANY ANY LIMITATIONS IN DEVELOPMENT OF FIRE ZONES SO THAT INFILL DEVELOPMENT ANOTHER SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT WOULD BE SUPER CHARGED IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO JUST SAY NO I THINK WE'VE GOT TO SAY YES AND SAY YES TWICE AS MUCH- BUT THE FACT IS THAT. THE DEVELOPMENTS IN THESE HIGH FIRE SEVERITY ZONES DON'T TEND TO BE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THEY ARE NOT NECESSARILY THOSE THAT ARE INTENDED TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING CRISIS. I IN MY COMMUNITIES THESE ARE OFTEN MULTI MILLION DOLLR MANSIONS SITTING ON HILLTOPS THAT ARE GOING TO PULL FIREFIGHTERS DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO HARM'S WAY. THAT ARE INHERENTLY GOING TO BE SUBSIDIZED BY THOSE NOT LIVING IN FIRE ZONES INTO THOSE LIVING IN THOSE NEW DEVELOPMENTS AND I FRANKLY DON'T FIND. THAT CROSS SUBSIDY FARE- I DON'T THINK IT COMPTON SHOULD BE PAYING. FOR NEW MANSIONS IN CALABASAS OR IN MALIBU- AND- I KNOW I REPRESENT MALIBU AND CALABASAS IN SOME OF THESE AREAS WHERE WE BURNED DOWN SO MANY TIMES AND SO IT'S HARD TO SAY NO IN YOUR OWN COMMUNITY ESPECIALLY TO- WELL HEELED FOLKS- BUT- IT'S MY DUTY I FEEL THE- TO BRING THESE ISSUES TO LIGHT. AND HOPEFULLY EDUCATE YOU A LITTLE BIT HERE TODAY I KNOW YOU'RE BUSY AGENDAS I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE INDULGENCE MISTER CHAIR- AND- WE HAVE WE DO HAVE A FEW WITNESSES YOUR TO GIVE SOME BRIEF TESTIMONY. MICHAEL WHERE FROM STANFORD HAS BEEN- VISIONARY ON ALL THIS WORK AND REALLY CENTRAL TO SOME OF THE ARCHITECTURE HERE SO I KNOW HE'S HERE AND- SOME OTHER SOME OTHER FIRE EXPERTS IN HOUSING FOLKS. ON. THE LINE BUT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR THE INDULGE AND THEY AND- LET'S LET'S GET SOME. WORK THIS YEAR I DON'T THINK WE CAN JUST RELY ON EXISTING LAW DESPITE WHAT WE SEEN IN THE COURTS AS OF LATE. I THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO HAVE TO STEP UP HERE TOO SO THANKS AGAIN. SENATE STERN I JUST WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU SO. CENTER STERN AND I'VE BEEN ATTACHED AT THE HIP IF YOU WILL- ON ALI SHE'S A WILDFIRE OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. AND HE IS AN ACTIVE AND ENGAGED MEMBER OF THE WILDFIRE WORKING GROUP- HE'S CHAIR OF NATURAL RESOURCES HE'S BEEN ON THE GROUND- DELIVERING FOR HIS. RESIDENT FOR THE RESIDENT SAID HE WORKS FOR A WIN THERE HAVE BEEN WHILE THEN FIRES- IN HE'S BEEN SINCERE IN HIS APPROACH. OF TRYING TO CHANGE THE CYCLE CHANGE THE BROKEN CYCLE OF DOING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER. IN CONTINI SEE. HOMES AND BUILDINGS BURNED SAID IN FACT SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WE'VE SEEN SEEN THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND HOMES THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND HOMES AND BUILDINGS. BURNED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT IS WHY I CENTER STERN AND I ARE PARTNERING. ON THIS ISSUE ON THIS LEGISLATION AT TO BE ABLE TO BRING COMMONSENSE STANDARDS. FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY- AND THAT'S ALL THIS IS ABOUT IS ABOUT SAVING LIVES IN MAKING OUR COMMUNITIES MORE SAFE- AND AGAIN CENTER STERN. YOU HAVE MOVED THE BAR HI. AND WE'VE LEARNED SO MUCH FROM YOU AND KNOW THAT WE'RE GONNA BE WORKING TOGETHER ON THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE AS A JOINT. BOTH OF US ARE JOINT AUTHORS. ON SB TWELVE AYE HE HAS SOME REALLY CRITICAL LEGISLATION REALLY REALLY CRITICAL PIECES IN. SB FIFTY FIVE ON LANDSLIDES AS WELL AS AIR QUALITY THAT I THINK IS. REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THIS LEGISLATURE FOCUS ON AS WELL. SO WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH SENATOR STERN HERE IN THE WEEKS AND MONTHS TO COME TO BE ABLE TO GET THIS BILL PASSED AND WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO IT JUST BEING HONEST ABOUT IT. WITHOUT CENTERS STERN SO SINISTER AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTNERSHIP. CENTER STERN IS GONNA BE HANGING WITH US RIGHT NOW IS WE'RE GONNA BE GOING. TO OUR LEAD SUPPORT AND LEAD OPPOSITION WITNESS IS. FIRST AND FOREMOST GOING TO BE INVITING. I PROFESSOR MICHAEL. ARE HE'S A DIRECTOR OF THE CLIMATE ENERGY POLICY PROGRAM. AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY AT MR WATER HAS THREE MINUTES IN WILL BE ARE GOING TO OUR TELEPHONE LINES. IF YOU ARE WE WELCOME YOU TO COMMITTEE YOU ARE NOW IN COMMITTEE THE FLOOR IS YOURS SIR. THANK YOU SO MUCH THE CENTER MCGUIRE AND I'LL JUST SAY. I AM HONORED TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU- AND TO BE WORKING WITH THE SENATE ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE. I'M HAVING THE SAME ISSUE THAT- SENATORS EARN HAVE HAD WITH AN ECHO SO I'M GONNA TRY TO SPIN OUT- SB THIRTY FIVE IS A BILL THAT WOULD REQUIRE STAFF- BEFORE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COULD BUILD NEW HOUSING IN HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS AND AT THE SAME TIME- WELL THE SAMETIME MAKE IT EASIER AND APPROVING ECONOMICS BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING LOW RISK AREA. IT SAYS NO KIND OF RISKY HOUSING WITHOUT PLANNING WHILE SAYING YEAH OTHER STATE I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY THE DIRECTION CALIFORNIA HAD IN ITS HOUSING POLICY WITH RESPECT TO WILDFIRE. I WE THE REALITY IS AS AS- SENATOR WHAT IRON STANDARD. INDICATED WERE LOSING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF HOUSING UNITS WILDFIRE. AND THAT'S EVEN AS WE STRUGGLE TO BUILD ENOUGH NEW HOUSING MAKE IT. CALIFORNIA CAN YOU TO BE IN AFFORDABLE ATTRACTIVE PLACE. FOR FAMILIES TO LIVE. CATASTROPHIC FIRES ALSO HAD A BIG IMPACT ON THE PEOPLE WHOSE HOMES BURNED DOWN ALSO ON RENTERS IN NEARBY COMMUNITIES BECAUSE INSURANCE COMPENSATION FOR FIRE VICTIMS LOSE. REPLACEMENT HOUSE. THOUGH IN SANTA ROSA AND KEEP OUT OF THIS BUT A WIDESPREAD BRENT. AND ELECTION FOR LONGTIME RESIDENTS. AFTER THE TOP EMPIRES POUNDING THE COMMUNITY IMPACT OF THESE NATURAL DISASTERS. I THINK SB FIFTY FIVE IN A KIND OF PLANNING THAT IT REQUIRES IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OVER THE LIFETIME OF THE HOUSE INSTRUCTED TODAY CLIMATE CHANGE AND CONTINUE TO GET WORSE DESPITE THE EFFORTS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE UNITED STATES AND THE GLOBAL EFFORTS ON CLIMATE. THE RISKS ARE VERY LIKELY TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE- OR HOUSE IS LOCATED IN THE BEER AT HIGH AND MODERATE- BOB PERHAPS ARE. THE CURRENT SCIENCE THE BEST WE UNDERSTAND IT YES THAT TWENTY TO FORTY FIRE SEASON LIKE THE ONE WE JUST EXPERIENCED WERE FOUR MILLION ACRES BURNING CALIFORNIA COULD BE. AVERAGE NOT TO ORDINARY THAT MEANS WE NEED TO BE THINKING AHEAD PARTICULARLY FOR LONG LIVED ASSETS LIKE- NEW DEVELOPMENT AS WE PLAN. ON IT WE DO HAS ARE PLANNING. IN ADDITION PASSED THE POINT OUT THE COST OF THIS NEW HOUSING INTO BARS OF PRESSURE THE POTENTIAL GROWING LAST YEAR WE SPENT MORE THAN THREE BILLION ON WILDFIRE SUPPRESSION. BUT THE RECORD ONE CONSISTENT WITH MULTI YEAR TREND. SB FIFTY FIVE WOULD DO TWO THINGS I THINK ARE IMPORTANT IN SEXUALLY TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND I WOULD ALSO AMEND THE EFFORT ON OTHER BILLS RELATED TO PLANNING SESSION. ONE IS. REQUIRE PLANNING REQUIRE COMPREHENSIVE MITIGATION AFTER PLANNING BEFORE WE PUT PEOPLE. READ COMMUNITY RESIDENTS AND FIREFIGHTERS IN HARM'S WAY NOT UNREASONABLE TO ASK THAT GIVEN THE RISKS WE FACE AND HAVE EXPERIENCED. THAT CAN IT THE STATEYEAH HOUSING WHERE IT STATE. EVEN AS WE MAKE IT SOMEWHAT MORE CHALLENGING AND MORE EXPENSIVE BILL HOUSING WHERE IT'S UNSAFE. I THINK THAT'S A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF GETTING TO A SOLUTION AND IF BASS ON HOUSING ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S RESIDENCE. SAFELY AND AFFORDABLY THANK YOU. PROFESSOR ARE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR GRAVE OF YOUR TESTIMONY AT ONE I CHECK IN A QUICK HOUSEKEEPING PURPOSES OR I DID THAT ECHO GET ANY BETTER FOR YOU DURING YOUR TESTIMONY SIR.

WHAT WE'VE COME TO NOW WITH THESE CATACLYSMIC FIRES IS NOT THE PRODUCT OF JUST NOW IT'S DECADES DECADES OF NEGLECT OF OUR FORESTS AND OUR WILDLANDS MANAGING THOSE FORESTS AND WILDLANDS. INSTEAD OUR POLICIES HAVE BEEN JUST TO LOCK THEM UP AND DO NOTHING. AND NOW WE HAVE SUFFERED. IF THERE'S ANYTHING GOOD HAS COME OUT OF THIS IS THESE FIRES HAVE GOTTEN SO BIG THEY'VE ENCROACHED ON MORE URBAN AREAS. AND NOW THOSE IN THE RURAL AREAS THOSE ROUGH WHO REPRESENT THESE ERRORS. WELCOME THE SUPPORT AND THE- OF PEOPLE IN URBAN TO NOW AFFECT. AND NOT A THOSE WHO FACE A FIRE PROBLEM BUT THIS. THAT IS SET A DISEASE. YES IS NOT MORE RICH. WELL PART OF THAT BUT THAT IS NOT BIGGEST AND THE DIFFICULT HERE AND I KNOW THAT CENTER FOR WELL THE NEEDS CERTAINLY OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT OUR COMMON AND PRAISING BEING NOW. BUT THIS BILL ADDRESSES TOO MANY RISK ALUM AND FRANKLY WHAT THE STAND YEARS LITIGATION. ENVIRONMENTAL TO ARE JUST AFTER IT'S LIKE LIKE THIS IT YOU MORE MORE OPPORTUNE. TO IN IN PRAGUE. IN HOUSING THE IN OUR ROOM EVERY. OR OUR SERVER ISING AREA I CALL THAT ANOTHER KIND OF GOVERNMENTS ISING FARAGE. WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE SETTINGS BUTTON WITH THAT IF SUCH SPECIAL. AND NOT WITH SO MUCH RISK TO GUN. AND IN THE LEGISLATION IN A NEW ENTITY IF WE DIDN'T HAVE A ALL AT THE STATE GO LEVEL. WE NOW HAVE GOVERNOR OFFICE PLANNING IN RESEARCH IN. AND TRYING TO THEIR AND I DON'T SEE THAT CONSTRUCTIVE I SEE THEM BEING HELPFUL TO THE ADMINISTRATION BUT NOT CERTAINLY TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SO. I KNOW THAT THE SENATORS IS WILLING TO WORK I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR MAKING IT A TO YOUR BILL SO WE MAY HAVE FOR THE TIME TO DELIBERATE I WILL CERTAINLY WORK WITH HIM IN GOOD FAITH TOWARDS THAT END. BUT TODAY I- YOU WE'RE NOT WE'RE GOING TO GET TESTIMONY TODAY SO I'M JUST REFLECTING ON SOME OF THE CONCERNS AS WE MOVE AHEAD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THE VICE YOU'RE ALWAYS VERY GRATEFUL WE'RE GONNA SEE IF THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS PLEASE CENTER DRAWS OF FLOORS YOURS- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- I VERY VERY MUCH APPRECIATE US SENATOR STERN'S. REMARKS AND HOW WE ARTICULATED THE CONNECTION THAT. WE ALL HAVE WITH EACH OTHER AND THE MOMENT WE SEPARATE OURSELVES OR ISOLATE OURSELVES THEN WE GET INTO BIGGER TROUBLE AND I THINK THAT'S PART OF WHAT'S GONE ON IS WHEN THERE IS A- CONTAMINATION ISSUE OR CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUE AND ONE PART OF THE STATE. IT'S ALMOST LIKE OKAY WELL THAT'S THEIR PROBLEM AND THEN- WHEN WE DON'T MAKE THE CONNECTION TO THE ISSUES AS THEY'RE HAPPENING IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE'S AND COMMUNITIES. SO ARE I REALLY APPRECIATE- THE CONNECTIONS THAT SENATOR STERN- MAKING AND I HOPE AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE KEEP THAT IN- WE KEEP THAT IN MIND BECAUSE WE HAVE TO SPEAK FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS I CARE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN THE- YOU KNOW HIGH FIRE- VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD ZONES. AS MUCH AS I DO WITH GOING ON WITH OFF THE EXIDE PLANT ENOUGH IN EAST LA AND VERMONT. YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SAY WELL THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO DO ONE WAY THE OTHER. IT DOES WHEN WE'RE TO- MAKE SURE WE LIVE IN A LOT WITH CLEAN AIR WATER AND WE DON'T HAVE THE THREATS. OF THINGS LIKE FIRES- ENCROACHING ON THE SOAP. OF THAT MAY BE A FAR FETCHED CONNECTION I DON'T THINK SO BUT I JUST- JUST TOOK TO KEEP ALL OF THAT IN MIND THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH AND DRAWS A VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS FROM THE COMMITTEE ASKING CLOTHING. REMARKS AND IN TURN OVER SINISTER AFTER THAT. HEARING C. NON I THINK THE IMPORTANT PIECE OF THIS IS LOOK. UP WE KNOW. THAT DEVELOPMENT AS USUAL. CAN'T CONTINUE TO HAPPEN. LEISER LITTLE AT RISK- WE KNOW THAT THERE REMAINS CONCERNED ABOUT PLANE COMMUNITIES- IS ACTIVE LITIGATION ON- TIE RANCH TEJON RANCH. WE'RE NOT VALLEY IN OUR NECK OF THE WOODS BASS ALPHA OF BUT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAYS IS INADEQUATE PREPAREDNESS WHEN IT COMES TO DEVELOPMENT- FIRE SAFETY WHERE THOSE HOMES ARE CURRENTLY BEING BUILT LITERALLY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF HOMES AND RESORTS ROOMS ACROSS THE STATE. SO WE KNOW WE HAVE TO DO BETTER I THIS IS NOT AT ALL THROWING STONES BUT JUST THE FACT IN THE TIME THAT WE'RE LIVING IN RIGHT NOW THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND HOMES AND BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN LOST IN THE LAST SIX YEARS. SIX YEARS. THAT'S AN ENTIRE. COMMUNITY SO LOOK BOTTOM LINE IS CENTER STERN IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK.

THE AMENDMENTS IN THE BILL I JUST TO BE CLEAR CHANGE THE ORIENTATION SO IT IS NOT. TAKING AWAY LOCAL CONTROL THAT A GENERAL PLAN THAT ADOPTS SUFFICIENTLY RIGOROUS STANDARDS CAN STILL. DEVELOP INTO RURAL OR SUBURBAN AREAS SO OUR INTENTION WAS NOT TO BE A HEAVY HANDED AND- TAKING AWAY LOCAL CONTROL AND THE SAME GOES FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO REBUILD THEIR HOMES AFTER FIRE. A SECOND JUST LASTLY TO SENATOR RISES POINT ON THE INDIVISIBILITY OF JUSTICE THERE'S A REASON STANFORD STUDY THAT I WOULD POINT OUT TO YOU ALL. THEY TALKED ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE WILDFIRE SMOKE OVER LAST WINTER DURING THE HEART OF THE PANDEMIC OF THE IMPACTS WE MAY SEE ON LONG HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT THAT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN NOTICED.

ALL RIGHT MISTER MODERATOR WE'RE GONNA BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE I DO WE HAVE QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE OR MOTION. A POLICE AS CENTER NIELSEN. MISTER CHAIRMAN LITTLE BIT OF REFLECTION ON MY FATHER WATER DISTRICT. FOR THOSE OF US IN THE NORTH WE LONG HAD AN ANTAGONISTIC RELATIONSHIP WITH M. W. D. STARTED FOR ME WITH SOMETHING CALLED APPROVAL CANAL THAT WAS PROMOTED BY FIRST TIME AROUND GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN. AND WE STRONGLY OPPOSE THAT THE KIND OF CURIOUS TURN THAT THIS TOOK AND IT DOES HAVE RELEVANCE TO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW I'M NOT JUST REFLECTING ON THE PAST. I GOT A CALL FROM THE CHIEF OF STAFF FOR GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA THE WANTING TO. SECURE MY SUPPORT FOR AND A HIGH LEVEL AND THEY WOULD BE OFFICIAL MISTER DAVID KENNEDY TO BECOME THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. WELL MY HACKLES IMMEDIATELY ROLLERS ON MY NECK AND I SAID. NOT KNOW BUT HAD NO. AND HE SAID WELL JIM YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THEM AND WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO MEET AND TALK WITH HIM. AND I SAID OF COURSE AND I DID. AND I FOUND IT TO BE AN EXTRAORDINARILY REASONABLE MAN THE LEADER AND ONE WHO COULD GET BEYOND WHATEVER HAD BEEN HIS PAST AND LOOK FOR THE GOOD OF THE STATE AND ONE OF OUR BEST DEPARTMENT DIRECTORS THAT LED EVER DEALT WITH. SHOW THAT WOULD LEAD TO THE POINT THAT INDIVIDUALS WITHIN AND WD CAN BE VERY CAPABLE AND VERY HELPFUL. AND SO I TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT AS WE DEAL WITH THIS CURRENT SITUATION OBVIOUSLY PERSONALLY I'M NOT VERY FAMILIAR WITH OTHER THAN THE STORIES. BUT THIS IS A VERY TROUBLED AGENCY. AND IT DOES WARRANT THE ATTENTION THAT OFFENDER STERN IS GOING TO. COST TO COME UPON THAT AGENCY IT DOES NEED IT. I WISH WE COULD DO SIMILAR THINGS FOR SOME OF OUR STATE DEPARTMENT AS WELL THAT ARE OUT OF CONTROL. THE PARTICULAR ET DATE BUT THAT SAID I THINK THAT THERE IS SOME HOPE HERE IN THIS NAY INITIATE A PROCESS WHERE WE CAN HELP THAT DISTRICT. GET ON ITS FEET AND BE CREDIBLE AGAIN. ATTENTIVE TO ITS PERSONNEL AND ITS POLICIES AND RESPECTED INSTEAD OF CREATING CHAOS SO I'M HOPEFUL THIS LEGISLATION WILL BE A POSITIVE STEP MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I JUST BE GRANTED JACK THAT'S TO SAY THAT THE- HISTORY CAN BE PRELUDE AND THAT THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHEN THINGS HAVE HAPPENED THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT. AND MAYBE JUST GET INTO THANK YOU SO MUCH A VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT- THOSE WORDS OF CENTER NIELSEN MISTER VICE CHAIR I CENTER DRUGS OF THE FOR SERVICE PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AS BEFORE EIGHTY- OBVIOUSLY THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS AND ACTIONS WHETHER IT'S BY INDIVIDUALS OR OR- YOU KNOW ONE INDIVIDUAL OR MANY INDIVIDUALS THAT IS OF VERY BOTHERSOME- IT SOUNDS LIKE IT TOOK. A WHILE FOR THAT TO BECOME UNFORTUNATELY MORE OF THE CULTURE THAN AN EXCEPTION TO THE RULE SO I SUPPORTERS BEFORE EIGHTY. MY HOPE IS THAT THROUGH AS BEFORE EIGHTY THROUGH THAT- INDEPENDENT AUDIT THAT M. W. D. HAS ALL CALLED FOR TO HAVE- TO HELP THEM. AND OF BY THE AUDIT- THAT HAS BEEN CALLED FOR THAT THE COMBINATION OF THOSE REALLY ESTABLISHED- THE RULES BY WHICH THEY WILL BEGIN TO CHANGE THEIR CULTURE. AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT JUST HAPPENS OVERNIGHT AND SO I AM MOST HOPEFUL UP AFTER IS BEFORE EIGHTY IS APPROVED AND SIGNED INTO LAW. THAT THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THEM TO BE THE TO TAKE IT SO SERIOUS THAT THEY IN FACT IMPLEMENT CHANGES FROM THE TOP STARTING FROM THE TOP ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE- THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THINGS ARE GOING TO CHANGE THEIR SELF- THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR. AND THANK YOU TO M. W. D. FOR THE ROLE THAT THEY'RE PLAYING AND TO ASK ME.

ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED AS MANY MORE IDEAS NOW OR SEEKING FUNDING FROM BOND SOURCES. THE DEBT ON THE TAXPAYERS. AS THIS PARTICULAR BILL IS CONCERNED IT'S AN AREA WHERE I HAVE GREAT INTEREST AND I THINK THERE'S MUCH IN THIS THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. I TOO WOULD THINK AMENDMENTS IN TERMS OF HOW THINGS ARE APPROPRIATED AND THERE'S A MEASURE. WHAT HAS BEEN OF CONCERN TO ME OVER DECADES OF BOTH FROM THE LEGISLATURE AND FROM OUTSIDE INTEREST HOW THESE THINGS GET TO BE A BIG PORK BARREL BY YOUR VOTE. KIND OF PROPOSITIONS. I'M NOT ACCUSING US OF BEING SUCH BUT IT HAS THE POTENTIAL. THE POINT I WANT TO DO WELL ON THOUGH. I'M TRYING TO CONCEPTUALIZE A MATTER AND WAY OR BY THE LEGISLATURE CAN PROVIDE HAVE OVERSIGHT. OF HOW THE EXPENDITURES OF THESE BOND FUNDS. ARE BEING MADE SO THERE CAN BE AN ACCOUNTABILITY INSTEAD OF JUST THROWING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OUT THERE TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS GO TO CONSTRUCTIVE PURPOSES AND WITH CONCRETE RESULTS. WE REALLY DON'T HAVE THAT THE OVERSIGHT IS MINOR IF ANY AT ALL. ALTHOUGH I CREDIT THE BUDGET COMMITTEE OF THE SENATE FOR BEING UP MUCH MORE FASTIDIOUS ABOUT. BEING ACCOUNTABLE AGENCIES BEING ACCOUNTABLE EXPENDITURES BEING ACCOUNTABLE ON OVERSIGHT WE HAVE ACCEPTED THAT AND IN OUR BUDGET RESPONSIBILITIES ON THAT COMMITTEE THAT'S GOOD. I'M LOOKING FOR EVEN MORE AS WE PROCEED WITH THE BOND MEASURES MAY BE OTHERS THAT COME TO BEAR TO THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT AREA AND I WOULD ARGUE IN TERMS OF THE- GENERATE I'VE MET THEM MANY GENERAL BOND IDEAS IT WILL BE COMING FORWARD THIS WOULD BE PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT. TO MAKE. AND I CERTAINLY WILL WORK ON IT I'M JUST OFFERING THAT WORD OF CAUTION THAT WE NEED TO PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION TO WHAT AND HOW QUICKLY WE PUT THESE BONDS UP AND OUT. AND WE MAKE THEM ACCOUNTABLE THAT THAT WE REALLY CUT COPY SURE PURPOSES RATHER THAN JUST THROWING MONEY AT THINGS THANK YOU MR THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER VICE CHAIR WE'RE GONNA TURN IT OVER TO CENTER PORTANTINO FOR RESPONSE TO THE VICE CHAIR- AND THEN. WILL OFFER- WILL LOOK TO SEE IF AND NUMBER WOULD OFFER A PROMOTION. ALL RIGHT TOLD ME TO PRINT YOU KNOW IF YOU WANNA RESPOND ADVICE YOUR PLEASE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND AS- THE DEAN OF THE SENATE COMMENTS ARE VERY WELL TAKEN- AS YOU HEARD. ON THE PHONE LINE MOST OF THE- AND- WE'RE TRYING TO. THIS BIGGER- AND WE'RE TRYING TO HOLD THE LINE WE UNDERSTAND THE BONDED INDEBTEDNESS QUESTION WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE AND THEN THEY WOULD GET A SIGNATURE FROM THE GOVERNOR SO WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM BUT ALSO KEEPING A WATCHFUL EYE ON OUR FISCAL RESTRAINT- TO GOOD PROBLEM TO HAVE THE PEOPLE WANT MORE- AND CERTAINLY I'D LOVE TO GIVE IT BUT- WE'RE TRYING TO BE VERY PRUDENT IN OUR APPROACH. THE SECOND THING IS A LOT OF THE MONEY BEING PROGRAM IS GONNA BE DONE THROUGH LOCAL CONSERVANCIES AND REGIONAL AGENCIES AGAIN THE IDEA IS TO HAVE IT BE BOTTOM UP NOT TOP DOWN AND BRING THAT INHERENT ACCOUNTABILITY FROM THE REGION'S BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW- SENATOR EACH PART OF OUR STATE IS DIFFERENT AND HAS A DIFFERENT INFRASTRUCTURE AND LEADERSHIP CAPACITY AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO WORK ON A LOCAL LEVEL TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS THAT. LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND- LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH. THANK YOU SACRAMENTO. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER PORTANTINO I DO WE HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE. ALL RIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR ALSO SEND PORTANTINO LOOK AT WHAT I REALLY APPRECIATE ABOUT THIS BOND ONE- YOU ARE DOING THIS RIGHT NOT FAST- WERNER SECOND YEAR IN A DISCUSSION- ON A BOND LIKE THIS. AND CENTER PORTANTINO IS ONE OF THOSE. MEMBERS THAT MEASURED IN HIS APPROACH AT FOCUSING ON DATA NOT JUST ON HEADLINES LOOKING AT WHAT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES THE STATE FACES IN TRYING TO BE ABLE TO GO AFTER INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS IN VERY GRATEFUL UP FOR THIS. I THINK THE OTHER REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE ABOUT THIS BOND- AS THE VICE CHAIR OF BUDGET WHO IS ALSO THE DEAN OF THE SENATE- THE GOOD SENATOR. AT CENTER NIELSEN HAS BEEN FOCUSING IN ON HOW DO WE LOOK AT LONG TERM FIRE PREVENTION FUNDING- AND THIS IS PART OF A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE PUZZLE THE BILL THAT LONG TERM PLAN TO TACKLE ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES. FACING AT THIS STATE SO OUT WE'RE GONNA TURN IT OVER TO CENTER PORTANTINO OUT FOR THE CLOSING AGAIN THANKS FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK SIR WELL MISTER MCGUIRE YOU GAVE A GREAT CLOSE ALL STATE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. CERVANTINO TRULY WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR EFFORTS THANK YOU SO MUCH WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE FLOOR EMOTIONAL FOR BY CENTER DRIVE SO MR CANAL IF YOU COULD PLEASE CALL THE FORMAL FORMAL- MOTION IN BECAUSE OF A- BUSH.

WE'RE BRINGING UP SOONER CORTESE CENTER CORTESE THE GOOD SENATOR FROM SAN JOSE HI THIS IS BEEN- AN ISSUE THAT HE'S BEEN DEDICATED ON HIS FIRST YEAR IN THE SENATE AND THAT IS THE BIGGEST ISSUE OF OUR TIME AND THAT'S CAR AND THAT KIND OF CHANGE THAT WE HE'S GOING PRESENTING SB THIRTY TWO FOCUSING ON BUILDING DECARBONIZATION REQUIREMENTS. MISTER CORTESE THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR HARD WORK. THE FLOOR IS YOURS SIR ON SB THIRTY TWO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OF THE FUTURE. SENATORS AND- PRESIDENT SB THIRTY TWO. OF THE- DECARBONISATION OCT TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE STATE- RESOURCES BOARD FINDS THAT CALIFORNIA'S BUILDING ENERGY USE ACCOUNTS. FOR ALMOST 25% FOR STATEWIDE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN- FOR HIS BUILDING ENERGY USE. WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR DIRECTLY EMITTING. THIRTY SEVEN MILLION METRIC TONS OF GREENHOUSE GASES. IT'S ESTIMATED. THE BUILDING DECARBONIZATION. CAN REDUCE TOTAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN A SINGLE FAMILY HOME. WHERE 3260% ON AVERAGE. YEAH US CARBON EMISSIONS BY ONE BILLION TONS ANNUALLY. BECAUSE THE THIRD OF CALIFORNIA'S TWENTY FORTY FIVE BUILDING STOCK WILL BE BUILT BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY FORTY FIVE. PRIORITIZING NEW CONSTRUCTION THAT INCLUDES DECARBONISATION TECHNOLOGIES IS KEY TO REACHING THE STATE'S FOSSIL FUEL REDUCTION TARGETS. TO DECARBONISE THE BUILDING IS TO REMOVE GHG EMISSIONS FROM BUILDINGS ENERGY USE. AND I DISTINGUISH THAT FROM THE BUILDINGS CONSTRUCTION THE USAGE OF ENERGY IN THE BUILDING AND TO ENSURE THAT THE BUILDING RELIES SOLELY ON RENEWABLE ZERO EMISSION SOURCES FOR INSTANCE- BY WAY OF EXAMPLE THROUGH BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION OR SOLAR ENERGY. I EMPHASIZE THAT. BECAUSE YOU MAY HEAR TESTIMONY TODAY IN CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. WITH A REQUEST TO CLARIFY THAT THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS TO DECARBONISE REMOVE CARBON FROM THE BUILDING. A BUILDING'S ENERGY USAGE. AND I'VE AGREED TO FURTHER CLARIFY THAT TODAY- WE THOUGHT THE BILL WAS CLEAR IN THAT REGARD BUT SHOOT ANY FURTHER CLARIFYING LANGUAGE BE NEEDED IN THAT REGARD- THAT THAT'S FINE WITH ME AS THE AUTHOR- BY REMOVING CARBON FROM OUR BUILDINGS ENERGY USE. WE ARE TRANSITIONING ENERGY USE FROM AGAIN BY WAY OF EXAMPLE NATURAL GAS TO CARBON FREE SOURCES SUCH AS ELECTRICITY OR SOLAR. I'LL BE CLEAR FIND THE BILL LANGUAGE- GOING FORWARD. AS I JUST SAID TO ENSURE THAT IT'S VERY CLEAR. THAT THE BILL DOES NOT EXTEND TO BUILDING MATERIAL FOR EXAMPLE- CARBON FREE CEMENT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A POTENTIAL. OF BUILDING MATERIAL THAT MAY BE USEFUL IN THIS CLIMATE CRISIS. WELL I THINK OF THINGS LIKE THAT ARE WORTHY PLACES. TO THINK ABOUT REMOVING CARBON THIS BILL IS NOT FOCUSED ON THAT THE SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON THE ENERGY USAGE OF THE BUILDING. TO ASSIST IN MUNICIPALITIES PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF STATE ENERGY EFFICIENCY TARGETS SB THIRTY TWO REQUIRES CITIES AND COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA TO MAKE A ONE TIME UPDATE. TO EITHER THEIR LOCAL GENERAL PLAN DURING THE NEXT UPDATE CYCLE ORDER CLIMATE ACTION PLAN DURING ITS NOT NEXT UPDATE CYCLE. OR BUILDING CODE DURING ITS NEXT UPDATE CYCLE WITH OBJECTIVES TARGETS AND POLICIES A SPECIFIED TO DECARBONISE NEWLY CONSTRUCTED BUILDINGS IN LINE WITH THE- PARVIS. ALMOST MOVE SERVED IN LOCAL AND REGIONAL GOVERNMENT AND INTERACTED WITH LOCAL AND REGIONAL GOVERNMENT PLANNING PROCESSES INCLUDING THE SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE PROCESS NO- THE TARGETS IN POLICIES ON THE PLANNING SIDE TYPICALLY GO IN A LOCAL GENERAL PLAN OF CLIMATE RELATED IN THE CLIMATE ACTION PLAN. BILL REQUESTED THE UPDATE INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING REPORT ON GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS DATA FOR EXISTING COMMERCIAL RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS. A SUMMARY OF LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL POLICIES PROGRAMS AND REGULATIONS. THAT WE A SYSTEM DECARBONISATION OF EXISTING AND NEWLY CONSTRUCTED COMMERCIAL RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS. IN A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF FEASIBLE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES TO DECARBONISE NEW CONSTRUCTION COMMERCIAL RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE'S EMISSION REDUCTION BUILDING ENERGY EFFICIENT TARGETS. THE URGENCY OF OUR CLIMATE CRISIS DEMANDS ACTION. CITIES COUNTIES IN THE STATE MUST MAKE A JOINT EFFORT DECARBONIZE OUR BUILDING STOCK FOR TO MEET THE STATE'S AMBITIOUS GOALS. IT'S IMPORTANT THESE UPDATES REFLECTED IN THE LOCALS PLANNING THE DOCUMENTS SUCH AS THE- EVENTUALLY REFLECTED IN REGIONAL PLANNING DOCUMENTS BUT IN THE BAY AREA FOR EXAMPLE.THE PLAN BAY AREA IS A DOCUMENT THAT'S REQUIRED. UNDER S. B. THREE SEVENTY FIVE. WELL IT WAS REQUIRED IN EVERY OTHER REGION IN THE STATE IN ORDER TO INFORM THE STATE. HOW REGIONS IN THOSE CITIES AND COUNTIES IN THEIR GENERAL PLANS IN THE PLANNING PROCESS IS INTENDED TO REACH GHG REDUCTION TARGETS. CURRENTLY REGIONAL PLANS REQUIRE THE INTERNET SPEED THREE SEVENTY FIVE. BUT THERE'S NO LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENT THAT THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES REGIONAL PLANS ARE BASED ON. A CONTAINER SEEM INFORMATION. THIS BILL WOULD HELP CITIES AND COUNTIES. RESTATE TARGETS INFORM STATE TARGETS IN A FORM OF COURSE THE REGIONAL TARGETS OF FEET IN THE STATE TARGETS. BY SERVING AS A CATALYST FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES. TO EXCEED STATE ENERGY THE CURRENT TARGETS BUT IF WE WISH- BUT IN ANY CASE TO DISCLOSE WHAT THEIR TARGETS ARE. I'D LIKE TO NOTE THAT I'VE SUBMITTED OFFER MEMBERS FOR THIS BILL ALL THESE LIMITS WERE FORMED. WITH INPUT. WELL FROM NUMERO LOCAL ORDERS K. YOU MEMBERS EXPAND THE FOLKS BILLION OPTIONS AVAILABLE FOR LOCALS TO MAKE UPDATES SPECIFIED IN THIS BILL. THE BILL WAS AMENDED FROM ASKING FOR THESE SPECIFIC UP THE SENATE GENERAL PLAN.

THAT PROMOTE CLEAN ENERGY AND REDUCE EMISSIONS TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE. CALIFORNIA IS OFTEN LEADING THE NATION IN THE WORLD ON CLIMATE POLICY BUT FOR CALIFORNIA TO REMAIN A GLOBAL LEADER FACED OF OUR CLIMATE CRISIS. WE MUST FOCUS OUR ATTENTION ON THE ENERGY USED IN OUR BUILDING. CALIFORNIA HAS OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND MILES OF GAS PIPELINES ACROSS OUR STATE. THE COST OF GAS MAINTENANCE IS ON THE RISE AND THE GAS SYSTEM CAN POSE SERIOUS HEALTH AND SAFETY RISK. IT HAS NEVER BEEN EASIER TO MAKE OUR HOMES AND BUILDINGS ALSO FEEL FREE IN CALIFORNIA. AND IT'S TIME TO GET RID OF DIRTY DANGEROUS TECHNOLOGIES SWAP THEM OUT FOR ISHANT ELECTRIC ONE. ENVIRONMENT CALIFORNIA RECENTLY RELEASED A REPORT EXAMINING BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION. AND CALIFORNIA COULD STAND TO REAP SOME OF THE HIGHEST BENEFITS IN THE COUNTRY ELECTRIFY ALL OF OUR BUILDINGS BY TWENTY FIFTY. WE CAN REDUCE EMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA BY TWENTY SEVEN POINT FOUR MILLION METRIC TONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE. AND THAT'S EQUAL TO TAKING ABOUT SIX MILLION CARS OFF THE ROAD. IN FACT CALIFORNIA RANKS SECOND IN THE COUNTRY FOR THE HIGHEST POTENTIAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS FROM ELECTRIFYING BUILDINGS IN THE NEXT THIRTY YEARS. THE REPORT CONCLUDED THAT GOING ALL ELECTRIC IN OUR STATE BUILDINGS. WOULD HELP CUT EMISSIONS IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH AND PROTECT THE PLANET. THIS BILL ASKS CITIE AND COUNTIES TO CREATE FEASIBLE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES. THAT ENSURE THAT THEIR BUILDINGS BECOME MORE SUSTAINABLE AND IS A CRITICAL STEP FORWARD.

THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AS- THE CHAIR INDICATED THIS IS A REINTRODUCTION. OF A BILL THAT WAS- VERY SUCCESSFUL LAST YEAR IN FACT GOT THE FLOOR VOTE FROM THE ASSEMBLY OF SIXTY SEVEN VOTES AND IT OF COURSE HAD GONE TO OUR HOUSE- IT WAS COMING BACK FOR CONCURRENCE WHEN WE HAD THAT LOVELY LAST DAY OF SESSION. WE'RE MANY BILLS DID NOT GET BACK TO US IN TIME FOR A MIDNIGHT DEADLINE SO I'M REINTRODUCING THIS BECAUSE IT IS VERY IMPORTANT. TO CALIFORNIA'S DENSITY BONUS LAW THAT WILL HELP US ENSURE THAT THE DENSITY BONUS LAW IS WORKING AND HOPEFULLY MORE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS USE IT. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE LESS THAN HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT HAVE APPROVED PROJECTS USING THE DENSITY BONUS SPECIFICALLY THE BILL. ALLOWS THE DENSITY BONUS TO USED STUDENT HOUSING. IT CONFORMS DENSITY BONUS APPROVAL WITH REQUIREMENTS AND HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT. EXPANDS THE DEFINITION OF FOR SALE PROJECTS BEYOND CMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDING UNITS FOR LOWINCOME FAMILIES. AND ADDS A PARKING WAIVER FOR SALE PROJECTS. THAT ARE WITHIN A HALF MILE OF TRANSIT IN INCLUDE FORTY PERCENT. OF MODERATE INCOME UNITS AND WHILE LET MY WITNESSES NOW SPEAK AND I'VE DAVID GARCIA FROM UC BERKELEY'S TURNER CENTER. AND PATRICK KENNEDY FROM PANORAMIC INTEREST ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER SKINNER THERE WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO TO OUR PHONE LINES TO BE TO TALK TO OUR TO. LEAD WITNESSES LET'S START WITH MR GARCIA FROM THE TURNER CENTER AT UC BERKELEY MR GARCIA YOU ARE NOW IN COMMITTEE YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES I'LL GIVE YOU A THIRTY SECOND PROMPT PLEASE PROCEED SIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DAVID GARCIA I IN THE POLICY DIRECTOR A TEACHER CENTER HOUSING INNOVATION. AT UC BERKELEY IT WE ARE A HOUSING RESEARCH AND POLICY ORGANIZATION. AT THE UNIVERSITY FOCUSING ON ALL MATTERS OF HOUSING RELATED ISSUES FROM LAND USE- YOU THE COST OF BUILDING HOUSING. FOR MANY YEARS SIMPLY HOMES TO MULTI FAMILY CONSTRUCTION. I THINK TODAY I'M HERE TO TESTIFY THAT SPECIFICALLY SUPPORT THE SENATE BILL TWO NINETY FROM SENATOR SKINNER IN PRINCIPLE BECAUSE OUR WORK HAS SHOWN THAT THE DENSITY BONUS LAW. SHOULD BE REFORMED TO ENCOURAGE GREATER USE THAT SPECIFICALLY ARE TWENTY NINETEEN CALIFORNIA RESIDENTIAL LAND USE SURVEY. FOUND THAT FROM TWENTY FIFTEEN THROUGH TWENTY SEVENTEEN MORE THAN HALF OF JURISDICTION THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA REPORTED TO US. THAT THEY HAD NO WILL GET. THE BONUS USAGE WHATSOEVER. AND THE CITY THE COUNTY. THAT'S A LOOK AT THE HAVE IT HE WAS PROBABLY MOST OF THE DISHES REPORT HAVING. JUST ONE OR TWO HE PUT US CRIED. DURING THAT SAME. SO THIS IS THIS COULD US THAT CHANGES THEN PEOPLE FLORIDA NEED. TO INCREASE ITS USAGE SHOULD GOT TO DRIVE JUST HOUSE CONSTRUCTION A WORLD ALSO. YOUR SHIFTED AFFORDABLE THAT COULD. WHEN USING THE TERM HE- WE BELIEVE THAT HURDLE TO NINETY TAKE IMPORT. TARGETED STEP TO IMPROVING YOUR- OF THIS LAW. LIKE SPENDING. THE COULD ONLY HOMEOWNERS. IF YOU HAVE A PROVISION BOTH OUR CREDIT AREAS OF NEED HEARING. IT IS ARE SIMPLE. ORDER FORMS THAT COULD HELP YOU MORE ABOUT. TOWARD USING A YUBA IN MORE. ACROSS THE STATE. AT THE END JULY WHICH OF THE- ACCORDING TO. AND THAT. I WANT TO THANK. THEM SKINNER FOR SENIOR WORK ON THIS ISSUE- EMPLOYED OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. TODAY- UNLIMITED THAT- CAN I HAVE A THANK YOU THANKS SO MUCH FOR CIGARETTES HERE FROM UC BERKELEY'S TURNER CENTER WERE NOW GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO PATRICK KENNEDY FROM. PANORAMIC INTEREST MISTER KENNEDY YOU ARE NOW IN COMMITTEE YOUR THREE MINUTES I'LL GIVE YOU THIRTY SECOND. PROMPT THE FLOOR IS YOURS PLEASE PROCEED. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- CAN YOU HEAR ME YES YOU COMING IN AND CLEAR THE FLOOR OF LOS. OKAY GRANT GRANT- MY NAME IS CAN ON THE- OF PANORAMIC INTERESTS- BASED IN SANTA. NOW I STARTED WORKING IN BERKELEY THIRTY YEARS AGO AND IN FACT- WAS THE FIRST DEVELOPER TO USE THE DENSITY BONUS. IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE IN BERKELEY. BETWEEN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE I TALK ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED APARTMENTS IN BERKELEY. THAT INCLUDED THE USE THAT UTILIZED THE DENSITY BONUS. AND RESULTED IN THE CREATION OF NINETY UP TO APPROXIMATELY NINETY. BELOW MARKET RATE UNITS- IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. I USE THE DENSITY BONUS AGAIN IN SAN FRANCISCO. AND I'VE USED IT ON TWO SUBSEQUENT PROJECTS PRODUCING THIRTY SIX. VERY LOW INCOME UNITS IN TOTAL IN THE SPACE OF ABOUT. FIFTEEN YEARS FIFTEEN PLUS YEARS- THE DENSITY BONUS RESULTED IN THE CREATION OF CLOSE TO. THREE HUNDRED TWENTY SIX. WELL INCOME APARTMENTS AT NO COST TO THE CITIES WHERE THEY RAN. AND WITH CREE MANAGEMENT BY THE MARKET RATE DEVELOPER BUT THE MARKET RATE MANAGEMENT FIRMS THAT WE- THAT WE HAVE EMPLOYED IN SHORT- THE DENSITY BONUSES BEEN EXTREMELY ATTRACTIVE AND VALUABLE. TOOL FOR US AND FOR OTHER DEVELOPERS. TO CREATE- BELOW MARKET RATE- UNITS AT NO COST TO THE CITY AND WITHOUT TAKING THE UNITS OFF THE TAX ROLLS IT'S- BUT IT'S BEEN A MORE- MARVELOUS SUCCESS. IN BOTH SAN FRANCISCO AND BERKLEY. AND AND SENATORS SCANNERS EFFORTS TO EXPAND IT. TO STUDENT HOUSING. TO MODERATE INCOME HOUSING AND TO OTHER KINDS OF HOUSING- IS- ABOUT VALUABLE AND I THINK. EXTREMELY IMPORTANT EXPANSION OF THE DENSITY BONUS- IT. ANOTHER IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE DENSITY BONE- WORTH NOTING IS THAT MAKE IT EASY. FOR LOCAL. TO SUPPORT PROJECTS BECAUSE IN EFFECT THEY HAVE- THEY HAVE NO LATITUDE TO DENY THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE NO LATITUDE THE DIET AND IT AND WHEN IT'S STATE LAW IT'S MUCH EASIER. FOR ALL PARTIES INVOLVED TO SIMPLY SAY THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO TO IMPROVE THE TO STOP THIS PROJECT STATE LAW BECAUSE PROVIDING.
