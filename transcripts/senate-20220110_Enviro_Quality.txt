AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT WE HAVE THE SIX MISSIONS IN THE WORLD THIS IS NOT A CLIMATE EMERGENCY AND. I OPPOSE THE R. FIFTY THREE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. YOUR AVAILABLE BECAUSE MODERN. I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT THANK YOU. NO THE COST OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU. OKAY I LET'S NOW OPEN THIS UP TO DISCUSSION QUESTIONS CONCERNS- THE GOOD TRIBUTE AS UNDER SCANNER. THANK YOU CHAIR- THANK YOU- CENTER MAGUIRE FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- I WILL MOVE IT. FIVE FOR A DISCUSSION OF THAT I'M YOU KNOW WHAT SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SAY WHY DO WE NEED TO DECLARE AN EMERGENCY AND I THINK THE ANALYSIS GIVES A GOOD. EXAMPLE THAT WE HAVE NOT YET DECLARED THIS AS AN EMERGENCY WHILE WE REFERRED TO THE CLIMATE CRISIS WE'VE NOT STATUTORILY OR OTHERWISE DONE SO AND IT DOES ENABLE CERTAIN ACTIONS THAT IN QUICKER THAN- CAN BE NONE OTHERWISE. AND I THINK AT THIS POINT IN TIME IT IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT TO DO SO BECAUSE I THINK FOR MANY OF US. IF WE TAKE IS THIS THE KIND OF FUNNY ANALOGY BUT IF WE TAKE WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW WITH THE PANDEMIC. WE'VE GOT A GOOD PERCENT OF PEOPLE EITHER VACCINATED OR UNVACCINATED WHO FEEL LIKE OKAY THE- YOU KNOW COVER IT'S GOING TO BE PART OF US SO YOU KNOW I'M DONE LIKE THIS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO LIVE WITH IT. ENDEARS WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT NECESSARILY WEIGHING FULLY THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHO IT MAY STILL REALLY HARM AND I THINK FOR THE CLIMATE CRISIS FOR MANY PEOPLE. WE'VE ME WHILE THEY'RE STILL DENIERS WE'VE BEEN IN THE MIDST OF IT AND IT'S SO- REAL RIGHT NOW THAT IT'S ALMOST LIKE WE'RE NEAR TO IT. AND WE CAN'T AFFORD TO BE WE CANNOT AFFORD TO BE- I MEAN I FOUND MYSELF AS SOMEONE WHO WORKED FOR SPECIALLY IN THIS FIELD I WAS ONE OF THE EARLY ACTORS IN THIS AREA STARTING BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY. AND I'VE GOTTEN TO THE POINT NOW WHERE IT'S- FOR MANY YEARS AGO. WAS THAT THIRTY SOME ODD YEARS. YOU KNOW I CAN LIKE A YOU KNOW WHAT. WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO MINUTE SORRY PASSED. THAT WE CAN NOT WE CANNOT INTERNALIZED DEFEAT ON. WE STILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO TURN IT AROUND BUT IT WOULD REQUIRE THAT TYPE OF ACTION THAT DECLARING IT AN EMERGENCY WOULD TAKE. SO I WANT TO THANK SENATOR MCGUIRE FOR DOING THAT I HOPE THAT IT REALLY DOES- CAUSES TO ACT IN THAT KIND OF EMERGENCY WAY. AND WITH THAT WE'LL MOVE IT. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR THUNDERSTORMS- THANK YOU RICHARD AND THANK YOU CENTER FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD INTO THE COALITION BEHIND YOU'VE BEEN RINGING THE ALARM FOR A WHILE NOW- WE- WE WORKED ON SOME OF THIS THIS SORT OF. EMERGENCY DECLARATION CONCEPT DOWN IN LA- THERE'S NOW AN OFFICE OF EMERGENCY MOBILIZATION AND- I WOULD LOVE TO ADD ON AND TRY TO SUPPORT YOUR EFFORTS IN VEHICLE OUT THERE IF THERE'S AN APPROPRIATE TIME. I KNOW THE ONE ISSUE THAT HAS COME UP AS THE- AS THE LA AREA EMERGENCY MOBILIZATION OFFICES STARTED TAKING SHAPE- WHAT WE MEAN BY EMERGENCY. YOU KNOW WHAT ONE EMERGENCY TO US TO ANOTHER PERSON CAN CAN BE LIKE THE ALARMS GOING OFF BUT I CAN HIT SNOOZE. OR OR MAYBE JUST DON'T LISTEN TO THE ALARM GOING OFF ANYMORE I MEAN I DON'T KNOW. IT'S SOBERING COMMENTS FROM SENATOR SKINNER ON THAT POINT- OF HOW MUCH OF AN ALARM WE CAN TAKE. I DO WONDER IN TERMS OF. WHERE HOW TO ACTUALLY GET SOMETHING OUT OF THIS RESOLUTION TO FURTHER THE- URGENCY. I MEAN WHEN YOU WHEN WE USE THE WORD EMERGENCY IN THIS CASE DO YOU THINK OF IT AS AN EMERGENCY LIKE EARTHQUAKE OR WILDFIRE IN PANDEMIC I MEAN WHEN WE'RE DECLARING THAT EMERGENCY. SHOULD SHOULD WE UNDERSTAND IN THOSE SORT OF TERMS. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER STERN- FOR THAT- IN THANK YOU SO MUCH AND- SKINNER BOTH YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE SO NUMBER ONE I THINK IS VERY SIMILAR TO- ANY OTHER TYPE OF EMERGENCY I THINK THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCES. THIS IS ONGOING. IT'S GOING TO GET WORSE. AS BAD AS OUR FIRES ARE- THEY EVENTUALLY ARE ABLE TO PUT THAT FIRE OUT FOR THAT COMMUNITY. THIS IS ONGOING. AND THE ALARM BELLS COULDN'T BE LOUDER. SO I THINK THE STATE HAS ALREADY STARTED THANKS TO YOUR LEADERSHIP THINGS LEADERSHIP OF. SARAH CASKEY IS WELL I PUT IN FIFTEEN BILLION IN REGARDS TO THAT RESPONSE TO THIS CRIME EMERGENCY. BOTH ARE PREPARING CAN COASTAL COMMUNITIES FOR MANAGED ETREAT. FOR WILDFIRE RESPONSE FOR REFORESTATION FOR DROUGHT OUT FOR COOLING CENTERS THE GOVERNOR'S GONNA PROPOSE OF I BELIEVE ABOUT ANOTHER TWENTY FIVE BILLION THIS YEAR. NOT FOR THIS EMERGENCY THAT WE'RE FACING RIGHT NOW- AND THIS IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE ON GOING. SO I DO AGREE THAT WE BECOME NUMB. THE NEWS- AROUND THIS PLANET. HAS NOT BEEN GOOD WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE. AND WE'RE OVERWHELMED WITH THE PANDEMIC. THAT MEANS WE NEED TO REDOUBLE OUR EFFORTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND BUILD UPON THE SUCCESS THAT WE'VE HAD LEADING THIS NATION. OUT OF THIS EMERGENCY BOTH WITH MONEY IN POLICYMAKERS ALSO I I'M GRATEFUL TO OUR PROGRAM WHO IS NOW LEADING OUR- KIND IT. ACTION WORKING GROUP TO BE ABLE TO BRING FORWARD POLICY SO I THINK YOU'RE GONNA TWO PRONG APPROACH THIS YEAR NUMBER ONE. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO BE ABLE TO HELP PREP COMMUNITIES INDOOR I HAVE COMMUNITIES RESPOND TO THIS EMERGENCY IN THE NUMBER TWO LASTING POLICY THAT WILL CONTINUE TO LEAD THE WAY HERE IN NORTH AMERICA. WITH A CALIFORNIA LEADERSHIP SO I THINK THAT'S A BIT THAT IS THAT'S MY BELIEF IN WOULD BE HONORED IF YOU'D BE WILLING TO COME ON AS A CO AUTHOR ON THIS PLEASE. YEP 1100% COUNT ME IN AND I WOULD JUST SAY AS YOU GO FORWARD SOMETHING TO CONSIDER AND I DON'T. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS GOES STRAIGHT TO THE FLOOR WHAT BUT- THE I. D. SURE THE JOINT EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE AND I'M THINKING ABOUT THE EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT AND ALL THE POWERS THAT THAT ENTAILS AND I JUST. I WONDER IF GOING FOR THAT SOMETHING TO LOOK AT MAYBE NOT IN THIS RESOLUTION BUT- HOW THAT WOULD ACTUALLY. YOU KNOW IF YOU WERE TO IF THE GOVERNOR WERE TO DECLARE SUCH AN EMERGENCY- INVOKING THOSE POWERS HOW WOULD IT AFFECT IMPLEMENTATION SAY OF. THE SCOPING PLANNER OF THE OTHER AREAS OF LAW WE'VE GOT SO. MAYBE NOT HERE BUT SOMETHING TO PONDER ANYWAY THANK YOU FOR THE CREATIVE AN IMPORTANT BILLING. AT ALL- D'AGOSTINO SECOND THE MOTION SO THINKING INTO THE INNER WORLD ESSAYS THAT- THIS WOULD PUT THE LEGISLATURE FIRMLY ON RECORD IN REGARDS TO OUR BELIEF THAT WE NEED TO BE EMERGENCY- AND THE GOVERNOR WOULD THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO DECLARE ONE. THROUGH HIS EXECUTIVE POWERS. YEAH SENECA. YEAH I THINK PM THERE MAY BE AN INTERESTED GOING. I AM LOOKING AT THE NINETEEN SEVENTY CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY ACTIVITY TO DETERMINE THE THRESHOLD. AS THE STAFF REPORT CONCLUDES HERE IS THAT. THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY SEEMS TO BE JUSTIFIED BECAUSE- FIFTY YEARS AGO WE ESTABLISHED. CONDITIONS OF DISASTER OR EXTREME PERIL TO THE SAFETY OF PERSONS AND PROPERTY WITHIN THE STATE CAUSED BY CONDITIONS AND pTHEY SAY. YOUR POLLUTION FIRE FLOOD STORM EPIDEMIC RIGHT DROUGHT. K. CYBER TERRORISM SUDDEN AND SEVERE ENERGY SHORTAGE. PLANT OR ANIMAL INFESTATION OR DISEASE SO WE LAUGH AT HIM HERE AT THE BODY OF LAW THAT WE'VE GOT NOW IF WE WANT EXPANDED. BUT THAT SEEMS TO BE YOU KNOW A LOT OF THOSE CONDITIONS ARE GOING TO WORSEN IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS AS A STAFF REPORTER CUT BLOCKS OUT SO- THAT'S- FOR THE- THE PUBLIC SHOULD KNOW THAT IF WE LOOK AT THAT WE THINK THAT WE NEED TO EXPAND IT. THAT WOULD BE. NATURAL RESOURCES TO DO THAT BUT- I'D BE HONORED TO BE ADDED ON A SET OF COLD WATER TO US AND REQUIRED THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE MATTER BEFORE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP CENTER CASKEY THANK YOU SO MUCH. ALL RIGHT R. LET'S GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLOSE AT SEVEN EIGHT BAND. OF TRYING HERE RIGHT. SEVEN I DON'T HAVE THE RAISED A HAND. UP ON MY SCREEN SO I TRIED WHAT I TEXTED YOU OBVIOUSLY DID CATCH. YEAH WELL M. AM I ABLE TO QUESTION FOR IT TO ARRIVE I APOLOGIZE I. DIDN'T SEE IT AREA I DON'T EVEN SEE A TEXT OKAY. OF ART. WELL FIRST OFF I JUST SAT SAY THAT TO YOU KNOW I AGAIN AS GOOD TO BE- ON THIS COMMITTEE AND- I LOOK FORWARD TO TALKING ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE FACED WITH HERE IN CALIFORNIA. OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE THE DIXIE FIRE LAST YEAR WHICH WAS. THE LARGEST SINGLE FIRE- IT WAS ALL CONTAINED IN MY DISTRICT. EXCEPT FOR A LITTLE BIT OF TAME A COUNTY WHICH ALL- PICK UP HERE NOW WITH REDISTRICTING. BUT I'M VERY MUCH CONCERNED ABOUT THIS RESOLUTION IF WE YOU KNOW GOD HELP US IF WE GET. ALL THE POWER TO THE GOVERNOR TO. IMPLEMENT HOW WE'RE GOING TO GO FORWARD WITH. INTEL THE CLIMATE CHANGE THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF CHALLENGES IN CALIFORNIA BUT- I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT ABOUT ARE WE LEAING WE'RE WORSE I'VE BEEN ELECTED NOW TWENTY FIVE YEARS. AND CALIFORNIA'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT LEADING AND CLIMATE CHANGE AND IT'S THE IT'S THE WAY WE SPEND THE MONEY IT'S THE POLICIES THAT COME OUT OF LEGISLATURE THAT. ARE VERY MUCH CONCERNING TO ME. AS YOU ALL REMEMBER LAST YEAR I BOUGHT A BILLBOARD IT CANNOT THE CARBON. IS EMITTED IN FOREST FIRES AND EVERY PERSON ON THIS COMMITTEE. VOTED AGAINST IT I DIDN'T GET I DID GET TO SENATOR BASES. I VOTE- SO GOING FORWARD IF WE'RE GONNA LEAD THE WORLD. VIRTUALLY GOING TO LEAD THE WORLD AND WE AND AS WE KNOW CLIMATE IS. CHANGING AND IT'S AND WE NEED TO HAVE THE CURB BUT WE'RE DOING IT HERE IN CALIFORNIA AS WE'RE EXPORTING JOBS. TO OTHER COUNTRIES THAT POLLUTE MAINLY CHINA. AND WE'RE WE FEEL GOOD ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE BUT WE'RE DRIVE I THINK THE- THE LIVING UP. WE SPENDING MONEY ON THINGS THAT WE SHOULDN'T SPEND MONEY ON LIKE THE BULLET TRAIN I BOUGHT UP SEVERAL TIMES. SO IT'S NOT A MATTER OF YOU KNOW PUTTING FEAR THE PEOPLE THAT THIS IS AN EMERGENCY ABSOLUTELY WE HAVE. A LOT OF WORK TO DO BUT IT'S HOW WE DO THE WORK. AND THE POLICIES THAT COME BEHIND IT. THIS STATEMENT BECAUSE THIS IS THE RESOLUTION. BUT IF THE BILL CAME FORWARD TO GIVE THE POWER TO THE GOVERNOR. AND QUITE FRANKLY THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN PUTTING TOGETHER THIS CLIMATE ACTION PLAN WHICH IS CAR WHICH WE GOT AN AUDIT LAST YEAR SAYING THAT DEBT REDUCTION OF CARBON REALLY WASN'T COUNTED PROPERLY SO SOME POLICIES AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT ARE GOING TO FOLLOW THIS RESOLUTION. AND I'D LIKE TO SENATOR TO EXPLAIN WHAT THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE IN CLIMATE CHANGE ARE WE GONNA CONTINUE TO REGULARLY- YOU KNOW SMALL ENGINES WHEN WE WHEN WE DON'T SPEND THE MONEY THAT WE SHOULD ENFORCE TREE I LOOKED AT THE BUDGET THAT WAS ROLLED OUT BY THE GOVERNOR. AND THERE'S ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS A BILLION DOLLARS. FOR FIREFIGHTING THAT'S FOR FIRE SUPPRESSION IS OBVIOUSLY THE BILL THAT THE- GOOD SENATOR. MCGUIRE AND I ARE JOINING ALL THREE FOUR. MORE FIREFIGHTERS AND FIRE TRUCKS AND HELICOPTERS. BUT WHAT IS OUR PLAN TO REALLY. TACKLE THE BIG ISSUES LIKE. DOING SOME FORESTRY PROJECTS AND ACTUALLY GETTING THE MONEY OUT LAST YEAR WE DID EARLY ACTION PLAN. AND WE COULDN'T GET THE MONEY ON THE GROUND SO I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT FOLLOWS THIS. STATE OF EMERGENCY BASICALLY WHAT THIS BILL IS SAYING HEY THIS EMERGENCY I THINK THE CALIFORNIA'S BEEN MEETING I THINK WE'VE BEEN SPENDING THE MONEY IN THE WRONG PLACES I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE AS FAR AS LEGISLATION FOLLOWING THIS. A RESOLUTION. I WANT YOU I'M DEMOCRAT PROCEED DIRECTLY DO THAT THROUGH MY CLOSER YES PLEASE REGRESSION FIRST AND FOREMOST A MATURE AGAIN- I JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT TODAY- AND THINK THE COMMITTEE EFFORT TO SUPPORT AND I ALSO WANNA TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY HOW GRATEFUL I AM TO GO TO WORK WITHIN OUR DOLLAR EACH AND EVERY DAY OUR DISTRICTS HAD BEEN IMPACTED. GREATLY BY A GROWING WILDFIRES THE DEVASTATION IS OFF THE CHARTS IN THE SUFFERING- IT HAS- THREE. SINCE THOUSAND FIFTEEN IN THE STATE. IN WHAT I FIRMLY BELIEVE IS THAT ALL THE LOW HANGING FRUIT WITH CLIMATE CHANGE HAS BEEN ADOPTED IN THE STATE. AND NOW WHAT WE'RE STARING AT IS A CRISIS IT'S GOING TO IMPACT OUR LIVES BUT IN PARTICULAR OUR KIDS LIVES ARE GREAT CAN GRANDKIDS LIVES AND WE DO NOT ACT WITH SPEED AND URGENCY ARE THEIR LIVES WILL BE WORSE OFF THAN OURS TODAY. SO HERE'S WHAT I THINK IS GONNA HAPPEN THANKS TO THE LEADERSHIP OF PROTEIN MACHEN'S THE SENATE IS GOING TO BE ADVANCING THE MOST ROBUST.CLIMATE ACTION PLAN THAT THIS LEGISLATURE HAS EVER SEEN FOCUSING ON ISSUES OF POLICY. THIS GOVERNOR HAS INVESTED MORE THAN ANY OTHER GOVERNOR IN CALIFORNIA. IN FORESTRY AND FORESTRY MANAGEMENT HANDS DOWN COMPARE HIS TRACK RECORD WITH PREVIOUS AND I AM GRATEFUL FOR GOVERNOR BROWN'S LEADERSHIP. AND I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE GONNA SEE. MORE MONEY IN FACT I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA SEE MORE MONEY IN FORESTRY. AND FIRE PREVENTION. THIS YEAR THAN YOU DID LAST YEAR AS BEING PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR AND- IF YOU WOULD YOU COULD SEE SOONER MY CASKET RIGHT NOW WITH YOUR BUDGET SEPT TWO HE'S READY TO MOVE ON OTHER IDEAS AND PROPOSALS AS WELL SO I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE. ADDITIONAL DOLLARS THAT WILL BE ADVANCE IN THE BUDGET WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND IT WILL LEAD ON THAT IN THE SENATE HANDS DOWN WILL BE LEADING THE STATE WITH PROACTIVE POLICY TO BETTER COMBAT THIS CLIMATE CRISIS.
