00:35:51.182 --> 00:35:53.785 region:rollup2
THE BILL'S INSPIRED BY A COUPLE

00:35:53.251 --> 00:35:54.919 region:rollup2
OF EXAMPLES THAT I LEARNED

00:35:53.785 --> 00:35:55.920 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

00:35:54.919 --> 00:35:57.722 region:rollup2
WHAT WE WERE --

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:59.457 region:rollup2
IN BONN GERMANY --

00:35:57.722 --> 00:36:00.592 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES IN MEXICO AND IN

00:35:59.457 --> 00:36:01.893 region:rollup2
BARBADOS FOR WE SEE LOCAL

00:36:00.592 --> 00:36:03.094 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES AND INSURANCE

00:36:01.893 --> 00:36:04.662 region:rollup2
COMPANIES WORKING TOGETHER TO

INVEST IN NATURAL.

00:36:04.662 --> 00:36:08.466 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE IN CANCUN ARE

00:36:07.132 --> 00:36:09.200 region:rollup2
REASSURED COMPANIES AND

00:36:08.466 --> 00:36:11.369 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS HAVE

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.203 region:rollup2
PIONEERED INSURANCE POLICY FOR

00:36:11.369 --> 00:36:13.138 region:rollup2
THE CORAL REEF.

00:36:12.203 --> 00:36:14.572 region:rollup2
I IN THIS POLICY LOCAL

00:36:13.138 --> 00:36:16.474 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS NEAR CORAL REEF

00:36:14.572 --> 00:36:18.209 region:rollup2
PAY INTO A COLLECTIVE INSURANCE

00:36:16.474 --> 00:36:18.843 region:rollup2
PREMIUM THE REEF PROVIDES

00:36:18.209 --> 00:36:20.912 region:rollup2
PROTECTION AGAINST STORM STORMS

00:36:18.843 --> 00:36:23.381 region:rollup2
--

00:36:20.912 --> 00:36:24.849 region:rollup2
AND OTHER CATASTROPHES AS AND IF

00:36:23.381 --> 00:36:26.384 region:rollup2
DESTRUCTION AND OF IF A

00:36:24.849 --> 00:36:28.620 region:rollup2
DESTRUCTIVE STORM DAMAGE IS A

00:36:26.384 --> 00:36:30.321 region:rollup2
CORE REEF THE SURE WILL PAY OUT

00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:33.124 region:rollup2
THE FUNDS FOR THE RESTORATION.

00:36:30.321 --> 00:36:34.426 region:rollup2
THIS ALLOWS --

00:36:33.124 --> 00:36:35.627 region:rollup2
FOR A DIFFERENT TYPE OF FUNDING

00:36:34.426 --> 00:36:37.295 region:rollup2
MECHANISM THAT'S QUICK THAT

00:36:35.627 --> 00:36:38.396 region:rollup2
DOESN'T IMPACT THE GENERAL FUND

00:36:37.295 --> 00:36:39.998 region:rollup2
OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OR OF THE

00:36:38.396 --> 00:36:40.999 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

00:36:39.998 --> 00:36:42.534 region:rollup2
THIS TYPE OF APPROACH IS THOUGHT

00:36:40.999 --> 00:36:44.536 region:rollup2
TO BE THE FIRST IN THE WORLD TO

00:36:42.534 --> 00:36:46.704 region:rollup2
TIE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS AND

00:36:44.536 --> 00:36:48.306 region:rollup2
THE ECOSYSTEM SERVICE OF STORM

00:36:46.704 --> 00:36:49.541 region:rollup2
PROTECTION TO MONETARY COST AND

00:36:48.306 --> 00:36:50.942 region:rollup2
REWARDS.

00:36:49.541 --> 00:36:52.544 region:rollup2
THIS IS LIKELY THE FIRST TIME

00:36:50.942 --> 00:36:54.713 region:rollup2
AND SURE HAS ACTUALLY ALSO

00:36:52.544 --> 00:36:56.381 region:rollup2
COVERED A NATURAL STRUCTURE IN

00:36:54.713 --> 00:36:58.249 region:rollup2
BARBADOS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE

00:36:56.381 --> 00:37:00.552 region:rollup2
USING MARKET MECHANISMS. TO

00:36:58.249 --> 00:37:01.119 region:rollup2
INVEST IN THEIR MANGROVE SWAMPS

00:37:00.552 --> 00:37:02.387 region:rollup2
AND CORAL REEFS.

00:37:01.119 --> 00:37:04.122 region:rollup2
THESE INVESTMENTS IMPROVE STAR

00:37:02.387 --> 00:37:05.356 region:rollup2
PROTECTION AND MITIGATE AGAINST

00:37:04.122 --> 00:37:07.025 region:rollup2
FUTURE DAMAGE.

00:37:05.356 --> 00:37:09.360 region:rollup2
IT IS SAID THAT AFTER EVERY

00:37:07.025 --> 00:37:12.464 region:rollup2
MAJOR STORM IT IMPACTS OF THE

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:14.332 region:rollup2
BARBADOS GDP BY 4% SO THIS IS OF

00:37:12.464 --> 00:37:15.500 region:rollup2
GREAT IMPORTANCE FOR THEM.

00:37:14.332 --> 00:37:17.802 region:rollup2
BUT AND WHAT IS ANALOGOUS TO US

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:19.337 region:rollup2
HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE CAN LOOK

00:37:17.802 --> 00:37:19.838 region:rollup2
AT NOT ONLY SEA LEVEL RISE

00:37:19.337 --> 00:37:21.005 region:rollup2
BECOME A COVER WITH THE

00:37:19.838 --> 00:37:22.941 region:rollup2
RESTORATION OF OUR WETLANDS.

00:37:21.005 --> 00:37:26.244 region:rollup2
AND OF COURSE FOREST'S

00:37:22.941 --> 00:37:27.645 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT FOR A AND WE CAN USE

00:37:26.244 --> 00:37:28.947 region:rollup2
INSURANCE INCENTIVES TO REWARD

00:37:27.645 --> 00:37:31.583 region:rollup2
GOOD BEHAVIOR AND REDUCE

00:37:28.947 --> 00:37:32.117 region:rollup2
EXPOSURE OF THE STATE LOCAL

00:37:31.583 --> 00:37:33.384 region:rollup2

CLIMATE CHANGE RELATED LOSSES

00:37:35.553 --> 00:37:38.223 region:rollup2
THIS ACTUALLY ALSO GIVE THEM

00:37:36.187 --> 00:37:39.858 region:rollup2
THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR REINSURANCE

00:37:38.223 --> 00:37:41.426 region:rollup2

BILL THAT WOULD.

00:38:32.744 --> 00:38:36.114 region:rollup2
CREATE A PROCESS THAT WILL

THE STUDY GROUP TO BE CREATED BY

00:38:44.389 --> 00:38:47.125 region:rollup2
THE BILL WOULD EVALUATE

00:38:45.356 --> 00:38:48.827 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL FOR SURE INSURANCE TO

A KEY A CONCEPT OF THIS OF THIS

00:38:58.369 --> 00:39:03.174 region:rollup2
OF THE BILL AND AND THE HOPE

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:06.077 region:rollup2
EFFORT THAT WE'RE DOING IS THAT

00:39:03.174 --> 00:39:07.579 region:rollup2
NATURE REDUCES THE RISK.

00:39:06.077 --> 00:39:09.514 region:rollup2
IF YOU LOOK AT FIVE RISKS THAT

00:39:07.579 --> 00:39:11.549 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA FACES RIGHT NOW

00:39:09.514 --> 00:39:13.284 region:rollup2
THEY'RE ALL A CURRENT RICH THAT

00:39:11.549 --> 00:39:14.285 region:rollup2
ARE EXACERBATED BY CLIMATE

00:39:13.284 --> 00:39:15.687 region:rollup2
CHANGE ONE ITS WILDFIRE.

00:39:14.285 --> 00:39:17.422 region:rollup2
DROUGHT.

00:39:15.687 --> 00:39:20.024 region:rollup2
FLOODING SHE LEVEL RISE AND

00:39:17.422 --> 00:39:22.093 region:rollup2
IRVINE HIGH HEAT NATURE CAN BE

00:39:20.024 --> 00:39:23.895 region:rollup2
PART OF THE SOLUTION SHED SET

00:39:22.093 --> 00:39:25.129 region:rollup2
FOR ALL FIVE OF THOSE.

00:39:23.895 --> 00:39:26.731 region:rollup2
THOSE RISKS AND FOR THIS BILL

00:39:25.129 --> 00:39:29.067 region:rollup2
WILL HELP US UNDERSTAND HOW WE

00:39:26.731 --> 00:39:30.835 region:rollup2
COULD USE THE INSURANCE AGENCY

00:39:29.067 --> 00:39:33.238 region:rollup2
AND INDUSTRY TO CREATE A NEW

00:39:30.835 --> 00:39:34.138 region:rollup2
MARKET MECHANISM. TO REDUCE WHAT

00:39:33.238 --> 00:39:36.074 region:rollup2
THESE THESE RISK THAT WE ALL

00:39:34.138 --> 00:39:37.842 region:rollup2
FACE AND A GREAT EXAMPLE IS THE

00:39:36.074 --> 00:39:39.043 region:rollup2
COASTAL WETLANDS THAT CENTER

00:39:37.842 --> 00:39:40.578 region:rollup2
LARA DID AN EXCELLENT ELOQUENT

00:39:39.043 --> 00:39:42.280 region:rollup2
JOB OF DESCRIBING.

00:39:40.578 --> 00:39:45.383 region:rollup2
OUR SCIENCE SHOWS THAT A CORAL

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:47.819 region:rollup2
REEF A IN PLACE CAN REDUCE THE
