THANK YOU JUST SIMPLY WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR BEING HERE AND FOR OUR CHAIR HAVING THIS REALLY IMPORTANT DISCUSSION. SIMPLICITY BELIEF BUT I MEAN THAT THE CLOCK IS TICKING. AND. I I KNOW IT IN MY EYES MYSELF TALK ABOUT THIS ISSUE PROBABLY IN A DAILY BASIS IF NOT TWICE A DAY. BECAUSE OF PRESSURES ON FROM THE PEOPLE OF OUR COMMUNITY I THINK THEY THEY THEY HAVE A FEELING THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S NOT DOING ENOUGH FOR THIS IN THIS IS THE MESSAGE THAT I GET FROM THEM. WHEN ARE WE GONNA START SAYING IMPROVEMENTS ONE IS THIS PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED ONE WHEN I HEAR ABOUT A SOLUTION. AND I DON'T I DON'T BLAME THEM THIS IS. THIS IS THEIR THEIR THEIR HOME DISK AT LEAST COMMUNITIES ARE WHERE THEY CALL HOME WHERE IT. I MEAN WHERE OF A BIG PORTION OF THE CROPS FROM OUR STATE GET PRODUCED. SHIPPED ALL OVER THE WORLD. THESE ARE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT AREA TO THE STATE AND IT JUST SEEMS THAT. THIS STATE AND THIS COUNTRY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN PARTICULAR IS NOT GIVEN. THIS PROBLEM THE ATTENTION IT DESERVES NEEDED THIS ADMINISTRATION'S ATTENTIONS FOCUSED ELSEWHERE. AND THIS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES A AFFECTING. ALL OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THIS IF IT'S GONNA AFFECT OUR WATER SUPPLY CAN AFFECT ENVIRONMENT. QUALITY OF LIFE. AND IT'S OF SOLVABLE PROBLEMS SO EVERYBODY THAT'S BEEN PART A SOLUTION AYE AYE. I I THANK YOU BUT AT THE SAME TIME I MEAN WE NEED TO PUSH THIS AGENDA A LITTLE MORE VIGOROUSLY. WE NEED TO COME UP WITH WITH PRACTICABLE. AN IMPLEMENTABLE SOLUTIONS I'M VERY PROUD OF THE FACT THAT PASSED LAST YEAR WE. WE APPROVED THE TENURE MITIGATION STRATEGY SHORT ON FUNDS SO. AS PART BOND IS ESSENTIAL. BUT WE WHICH IS EVEN THEN IT WILL NOT BE ENOUGH IT'LL BE A FRACTION OF THE SOLUTION. AND I I HAVE I'M ENCOURAGED THAT OTHER THINGS ARE WE GONNA. THE OTHER THINGS FOR WE'D WE ARE DOING COULD BEAR MORE FRUIT. BUT LIKE I SAID I I ASK EVERYBODY THAT'S INVOLVED TO PLEASE GIVE THIS THIS MATTER EUROPE MUSCLE TENSION. I I FEEL THAT WE ARE AND I FEEL THAT. WE WE WE CONTINUE TO HOST. THESE COMMITMENT COMMITTEE MEETINGS AND THE SESSIONS AND WE CONTINUE TO DISCUSS THIS AT THE LEGISLATIVE. LEVEL BUT WE NEED WE NEED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO BE PART OF THIS. WE EVEN MADE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. TO PUT A LITTLE MORE EFFORT INTO THIS INTO. COME UP WITH. A STRATEGY YOU GOT CUT. FINALLY GETS US TO WHEN IT WE NEED TO GO. PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE. ARE BEING AFFECTED EVERYDAY WHEN YOU GO TALK TO KIDS OUT THERE WITH PASS MOTHER CAN BARELY BREATHE. THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN TELL THEM TO ASSUAGE THEIR FEARS OR CONCERNS THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN TELL THEM. SAY YOU KNOW MY BAD OR. WE'RE WORKING ON IT ONE DAY WE WILL SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. SO. SIMPLY SIMPLY PUT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR FOR THIS HEARING AND. AND I EVERYONE ELSE HERE ON THE LEGISLATURE'S BEEN. PART OF HELPING US. I KNOW SOME OF THE VOTES HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT SOME OF THE SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE BROUGHT FOR HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT THERE'D THERE'D DIFFICULT TASKS. BUT FOR OUR COLLEAGUES THAT HAVE BEEN THAT BEEN THERE THAT HAVE ALLOWED US TO PUT SOME OF THIS FUNDING AND AND. TO ADVANCEMENT OF BILLS THAT WE WORKED ON WANT TO THANK YOU AS WELL BECAUSE. THIS IS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE IN OUR STATE THIS ISSUE HAS NEVER RISEN TO THE TOP WHERE'S BEEN TAKEN SERIOUSLY AS A HOUSE IN LAST FEW YEARS. AND AND I THINK THE GOVERNOR AND THE ENTIRE LEGISLATURE'S STRAIGHT SPECIALLY THOSE THAT HAVE HAD THE COURAGE TO. TO GIVE US A A A VOTE IN SUPPORT OF SOLVING THIS PROBLEM THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU SIR HUESO AYE I DO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. YOU WEEKS LEADING UP TO THE. S. B. FIVE PARK BOND VOTE. SENATOR NOW I GOT TO MEET WITH THE GOVERNOR AND TO KIND OF FORCED TO HAND A BIT TO ENSURE THAT THERE WAS A. REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. FOR THE A WATER IMPORT A COMPONENT TO A POSSIBLE. CHAUNCEY SOLUTION SOME THAT HAD NOT BEEN PART OF THE PLAN ITSELF SONIC KNOWLEDGE UNIT YOUR PERSISTENCE ON THAT I THINK. IS WHAT THAT MADE AT THE AGENCY MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION AND. NOW WE HAVE A HANDFUL OF. PROPOSALS THAT HAVE BEEN PRESENTED. TO THE AGENCY. SO I THINK YOU AGAIN LET ME BEGIN BY THANKING EVERYONE WAS HERE OF LONG WITH MY COLLEAGUES. ARE FROM THE WATER PARKS AND WILDLIFE COMMITTEE THING SO MUCH FOR THAT LET ME SOME OF YOUR TIME ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT'S. IMPORTANT AS A CENTER SAID TO THE STATE. AB BUT THAT THAT WE HEAR CONSTANTLY IN OUR DISTRICT GOT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE. THE SOLVENCY ISSUE IS ONE THAT GOES BACK MANY YEARS BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME. WE HAVE A TEN YEAR PLAN THAT IS IN PLACE TO ADDRESS BOTH THE PUBLIC HEALTH. ASPECTS OF THIS PROBLEM AS WELL AS THE ECOLOGICAL CHALLENGES THAT EXIST THERE. WE KNOW THAT THEIR BEEN TREMENDOUS BARRIERS TO MOVING THE AGENDA FORWARD. BUT AT THE SAME TIME. WE NOW RUN INTO A HANDFUL OF DELAYS AND PART OF OUR CONVERSATION TODAY. IS THAT WE WANT TO HEAR WHAT CAN WE DO AS POLICY MAKERS TO FACILITATE UP AN EXPEDITIOUS A PLAN. MOVING FORWARD WITH THE MINIMAL AMOUNT OF DELAYS AS POSSIBLE CONSIDERING THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE HAVE. IN THE COMMUNITY. BUT THIS WON'T BE OUR LAST HEARING OF COURSE. OUR PLAN IS TO HAVE. A ADDITIONAL HEARING AND WE INVITE BOTH OUR COLLEAGUES FROM THE LEGISLATURE. A TO JOIN US IN THE BEAUTIFUL SUMMER TIME IN THE COACHELLA VALLEY. TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AS A FOLLOW UP THE TODAY'S. DISCUSSION AND SEE WHAT TYPE OF PROGRESS WE'VE MADE SINCE TODAY. ARM WHEN WE'D MEET SOMETIME IN THE SUMMER. SO WITH THAT I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT WE GET STARTED MISS RACHEL ELDERS FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WILL GIVE US. A BRIEF OVERVIEW AND WOOD THEN JUMP RIGHT INTO THE TWO PANELS THAT WE HAVE HERE POP FOR THE REST OF THE HEARINGS OF. GOOD MORNING WELCOME AND YOU MAY BEGIN GOOD MORNING THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BEARS RACHEL EHLERS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND I THINK MY MATH SERGEANTS HIM THAT PASSING A HAND OUT THAT WE'VE PREPARED. I THINK MY ROLE TODAY IS TO PROVIDE SOME VERY BRIEF CONTEXT OCCUPY BACKGROUND EXTREMELY BRIEF GIVEN THAT I THINK THE MEMBERS ARE PRETTY FAMILIAR WITH THE ISSUE. SPEND A LITTLE BIT OF TIME ON THE FISCAL AND THEN GET OUT OF YOUR WAY FOR YOU TO GET INTO THE MEAT OF THE HEARING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION PANEL. FOLLOWING ME AND AND STAKEHOLDERS AS WELL. SO TURNING TO PAGE ONE. FAT DISPIRITO REVIEW OF THE SEE IT IS THE LARGEST LAKE IN TERMS OF SURFACE AREA IN THE STATE EXTREMELY SALINE BECAUSE IT HAS NO OUTLET. SO AS THE SALTY WATER COMES IN FROM AGRICULTURAL RUNOFF IT HAS NOWHERE TO GO AND OF AS IT EVAPORATES THE SALTS ARE LEFT BEHIND. THE LAKE IS SHRINKING WHICH IS ONE OF THE ISSUES WE'RE HERE TO DISCUSS. M. IT BEEN PART BECAUSE IT HAS NO OUTLET AND IN PART BECAUSE OF THAT SOME WATER TRANSFER DEALS IN PARTICULAR THE QUANTIFICATION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT KNOWN AS THE QSAR IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE. WHICH TRANSFERRED SOME WATER FROM AGRICULTURAL USE TO OTHER AREAS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REDUCING THE RUN OFF INTO THE LAKE THAT HAS BEEN MITIGATION WATER BEING PROVIDED OVER THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS BUT THAT OUT REQUIREMENT ENDED IN DECEMBER SO THAT'S REALLY NOT CHANGING THE STATE OF THE LAKE RAPIDLY NOW. AS THE LAKE SHRINKS DRY LAKE BED WHICH IS REFERRED TO AS PLAYA IS EXPOSED TO NOT CREATE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT TODAY. DOWN AT THE AT THE BOTTOM BULLET YOU CAN SEE THE ADMINISTRATION HAS ESTIMATED THAT ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED ACRES OF PLAYA ANNUALLY WILL BE EXPOSED OVER THE NEXT. TEN YEARS IT VARIES YEAR BY YEAR BUT THAT'S THE AVERAGE ESTIMATE. SO TURNING TO PAGE TWO. WHY DOES THIS MATTER WHY IS THIS A STATEWIDE ISSUE SEVERAL REASONS? pRISKS THAT PRESENT THEM IN THE REGION. HAS THE LAKE SHRINKS AND DIE PLAYA IS EXPOSED PARTICULATE MATTER ABOUT BECOMES AIRBORNE CREATING RISKS BOTH FOR HUMANS AS WELL AS WILDLIFE AND AGRICULTURAL. INTERESTS IT'S ALSO AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT MIGRATORY BIRD HABITAT HAS OTHER WETLANDS ACROSS THE STATE HAVE BEEN. FILLED IN AND AND. DRIED UP AND DEVELOPED OVER THE YEARS THIS IS ONE OF THE. IMPORTANT HABITATS THAT STILL IS AVAILABLE ON THE PACIFIC FLYWAY AS BIRDS TRAVEL FROM NORTH TO SOUTH AND SOUTH TO NORTH. I IT SO IT'S NOT ONLY IMPORTANT FOR THESE BIRDS AT THAT THERE IS WATER THERE BUT ALSO THAT THE WATER'S NOT. SALINE TO SUPPORT THE FISH THAT THEY NEED TO EAT. THERE'S ALSO HABITAT FOR A FOR AT RISK ROBERTSON SPECIES THAT HAVE BEEN LISTED BOTH ON THE FEDERAL AND STATE ENDANGERED SPECIES LISTS. AYE THIS IS ALSO A KEY COMPONENT OF ALL OF THE STATE'S WATER AGREEMENTS ON THE ALONG THE COLORADO RIVER. BOTH IN THE PAST AND SOME OF THE FUTURE I DROUGHT CONTINGENCY NEGOTIATIONS THAT ARE UNDERGOING. AND THEN FINALLY IT IS HAS A GREAT DEAL OF REGIONAL IMPORTANCE FOR THE ECONOMY HOUSING MARKET AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY. A QUALITY OF LIFE AND ALSO RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. SO TURNING TO PAGE THREE THE STATE HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THIS REGION THE STATE HAS COMMITTED TO MITIGATING THE EFFECTS OF THIS WATER TRANSFERS AND PAYING MOST OF THE COSTS ABOVE THE LEVEL THAT WAS SET WITH THE OTHER. ACCU ESSAY PARTIES THERE WAS ALSO RAM THIS WAS AGAIN MEMORIALIZED IN A RECENT M. O. U. WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT THE STATE WAS GONNA PLAY THE LEAD ROLE. SO AS YOU WILL DISCUSS IN THE MEAT OF YOUR AGENDA TODAY THE CITY HAS PREPARED IS BEGINNING TO IMPLEMENT A MANAGEMENT PLAN. THAT I REFERRED TO AS THE SALTON SEA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AS SMP PHASE ONE HAS WAS ADOPTED IN THE PLAN LAST MARCH THAT SAID ANNUAL MILESTONES FOR HOW MUCH ADAM OF THE EXPOS PLAYER WAS GOING TO BE MITIGATED. BOTH FOR HABITAT AS WELL AS FOR DUST SUPPRESSION. AND THAT PLAN INCLUDED A GOAL OF CONSTRUCTING FIVE HUNDRED ACRES OF PROJECTS IN THIS YEAR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN SO THAT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE QUESTIONS YOU MAY WANT TO ASK THE NEXT PANELIST HOW IS THAT PLAN GOING. AND THEN GOALS OF HAVE NEARLY THIRTY THOUSAND ACRES BY THE END OF THE TEN YEAR PLAN THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD HAS ALSO BEEN INVOLVED RECENTLY ANOTHER SOME INFORMATION IN YOUR PACKET ABOUT AND. THAT THEY ADOPTED IN ORDER THAT THAT PUT THOSE ANNUAL GOALS FOR CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS AND MITIGATION PROJECTS. IN THE ORDER SO THERE THEY ARE ALSO A PLAYER INVOLVED IN TRYING TO HELP ENSURE THAT THE SCHOOLS ARE UNDERTAKEN. SO TURNING TO PAGE FOUR I THINK THIS IS THE HEART OF WHAT I'VE BEEN ASKED TO PRESENT FOR YOU TODAY. THIS SUMMARIZES THE FUNDING THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED THUS FAR FOR ACTIVITIES AT THE CITY. YOU CAN SEE IN THE LEFT HAND COLUMN THAT AMOUNT THAT'S AUTHORIZED AND THAT IN THE RIGHT HAND COLUMN ARE RIGHT MIDDLE COLUMN THE AMOUNT THAT STILL REMAINING. THERE'S BEEN FUNDING FROM THREE BONDS PROVIDED. GO SEE PROPOSITION ONE IS NOT ON YOUR TALK ABOUT THAT A MINUTE BUT THE SO THIS IS FUNDING THAT. HAS BEEN PROVIDED OVER THE PAST. I'M. SEVERAL DECADES AT THIS POINT. A MOST OF IT'S BEEN USED FOR PLANNING EFFORTS THERE HAS BEEN SOME INITIAL CONSTRUCTION OF SOME PROJECTS YOU CAN SEE IN THE DESCRIPTION. THERE'S BEEN FUNDING FROM THE STATE A SMALL AMOUNT PROVIDED FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOT MUCH. AND THEN FUNDING FROM LOCAL AGENCIES THAT WERE PARTY TO THE QSAR THE FIRST LINE THAT SAYS Q. ESSAY AT AT THE IN THE LOCAL RATTO CHRIS A JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY YOU CONCEDE THAT TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION COMMITMENT. THAT IN TWO THOUSAND THREE THE THE THREE AGENCIES HOTEL WATER VALLEY WATER DISTRICT IMPAIR THEIR KITCHEN DISTRICT IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY WATER AUTHORITY. AT COMMITTED TO PROVIDE A TOTAL OF ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE MILLION WITH INFLATION OVER TIME THAT THAT CURRENT ESTIMATE IS THAT WILL ACTUALLY BE AN EQUIVALENT OF TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT. I AM SOME OF THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED THUS FAR TO START SOME PROJECTS AND AND REALLY TO SUPPORT THE MITIGATION WATER THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED OVER THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS BUT THEIR STUFF FUNDING. FOR THOSE LOCAL EFFORTS. AVAILABLE THERE. SO. YOU KNOW I THINK IN SUMMARY QUITE A BIT OF MONEY AUTHORIZED ABOUT HALF OF IT SPENT. BAT NAM. NEWTON NOT A HUGE AMOUNT OF ACTIVITY ACTUALLY. GOING ON AND ON THE GROUND BUT THAT THE LAKE HASN'T SHRUNK AT TO THE DEGREE THAT IT'S GOING TO START NOW SELF AND ALL OF THIS FUNDING AND BOTH THAT HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED AND THEN SPENT IS PRIOR TO THE TEN YEAR PLAN. AND FOR EFFORTS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH THE TENURE PLAN. SO THAT LEADS TO THE QUESTION OF WHAT HOW WE CAN IMPLEMENT THE TEN YEAR PLAN AND THE PROJECTS THERE. SO TURNING TO PAGE FIVE. M.. THE FIRST BULLET JUST ADDRESSES THAT FIGURE THAT FOR ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED THAT'S FAR. THE PLAN ESTABLISHES TENURE GOALS AND ASSOCIATED COSTS OF ROUGHLY FOUR HUNDRED MILLION SEPARATE AGAIN FROM THE FUNDING SHOWN IN THE TABLE HERE. SO HOW WE GONNA PAY FOR THAT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION WELL PROPOSITION ONE PROVIDED EIGHTY MILLION THAT'S AVAILABLE IT'S ALREADY BEEN A BAD APPROVED BY VOTERS AND. A PERMITTED BY THE LEGISLATURE'S THAT'S AVAILABLE. TIME AND I THINK YOU'LL HEAR FROM FROM THE ADMINISTRATION HOW THEY'RE PLANNING TO USE THAT FUNDING. SO THAT'S OF THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR THESE TENURE GOALS. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE REST WELL. PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT AS WAS NOTED WOULD PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED MILLION IF APPROVED BY VOTERS IN JUNE. THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL BALLOT MEASURE THAT DISQUALIFIED FOR NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AN EIGHT POINT NINE BILLION DOLLAR WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL BONTA THAT WOULD PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED MILLION IF VOTERS APPROVE FAT. SO THAT GET THAT WOULD GET CLOSE. BUT THAT'S. ONLY FOR THOSE FIRST TEN YEARS WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THOSE TEN YEARS AND ALSO WHAT WHAT ABOUT THE MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS FOR THE PROJECTS THAT ARE CONSTRUCTED HOW WILL THAT BE FINE AND I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER. CROWD GOOD GOOD QUESTION YOU MAY WANT TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION I'M NOT SURE AT THIS POINT. THAT THERE'S AN ANSWER FOR THAT THAT THAT FUNDING SPEND FOR ADAM. IDENTIFIED AT THIS POINT. SO WITHOUT I'M HAPPY TO AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OR. THEM THANK YOU FOR THAT ONE REVIEW ANY CA COLLEAGUES ANY QUESTIONS ON THE. LEO REPORT IT SIR. YEAH JUST ON THE PLANET. GRAPH THEIR WHERE CHINA AND SPENT. WHAT WHY IS YOU KNOW IT AT THIS POINT WHY HAS IT BEEN? FUND'S SPENT OF THAT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION THAT. WAS AUTHORIZED. SO IN AND MOVING DOWN THROUGH THE CATEGORIES I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE BIGGEST POTS OF UNSPENT FUNDING YOU SEE THE PROPOSITION EIGHTY FOUR THERE'S TWENTY THREE POINT FOUR MILLION AS I UNDERSTAND IT. AS THE BULK OF THAT HAS BEEN APPROPRIATED. AWARDED BY THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD IS READY TO GET GOING AND HIT THE GROUND SO THE PROJECT IS JUST TAKEN AWHILE TO GET. GOING I GUESS PLANNED IN READY BUT BUT THAT MONEY IS ESSENTIALLY COMMITTED AND READY TO TO HIT THE GROUND. THE OTHER BIG POTS OF FUNDING DAD THAT US A JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY FUNDING IN THE SONGS HE RESTORATION LIMIT HAVE BEEN PLANNED TO BE PAID IN OVERTIME BY THOSE AGENCIES. SO IT'S BEEN COMMITTED BUT IT ISN'T REALLY AN HAND THAT'S CAN BE PAID AND ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. IN TERMS OF SOME OF THAT THE FEDERAL GRANTS I THINK I HAVE JUST BEEN RECEIVED SO. FROM MY DAY AGAIN GOOD QUESTIONS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT'S TAKEN AWHILE TO GET THE PLANS. THE PERMITS TO GET THE PROJECTS READY BUT MOST OF THIS MONEY AT THIS POINT THEY'RE READY TO SPEND. YES SCORE. FAMOUS CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION KIND WELL FOR THE SAME GRAPH WITH REGARD TO THE FEDERAL EXPENDITURES OR OR APPROPRIATIONS. IN THE RELATIVELY SMALL OF ALL THINGS CONSERVE IT LIKE MAYBE TWO PERCENT OF THE OVERALL ALLOCATION. CAN YOU COMMENT ON WHY THAT IS YOU MAY. IT'S BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE FROM FEDERAL. ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN SOUGHT THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS AND THEN NOTING THAT. YOU'D THE LAST BULLET POINT IS THAT YOU CONSIDER THAT THE STATE IS CONSIDERING PURSUING ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING HOW LIKELY IS THAT GIVEN HOW SMALL AMOUNT HAS BEEN GIVEN TODAY. YEAH I THINK THOSE ARE GREAT QUESTIONS IN AND I'M I'M HOPING HOPEFULLY LAST THE ADMINISTRATION AND SEE WHAT THEIR RESPONSES TO AND I THINK. CERTAINLY FROM A STATE PERSPECTIVE IT'S DISAPPOINTING THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD MORE FEDERAL SUPPORT IF YOU LOOK AT THINK IN YOUR PACKET YOU'VE GOT A GRAPH THAT SHOWS THAT OWNERSHIP. OF THE SEA AND YOU CAN SEE QUITE A BIT OF IT IS FEDERALLY OWNED SO IT SEEMS LIKE THEY'VE GOT A A PRETTY STRONG STAKE IN THIS AS WELL. HAVEN'T COME FORTH WITH THE DOLLARS YET. TIME THE IT SEEMS IT SEEMS TO ME THAT NOT ONLY SHOULD THEY. BE INTERESTED GIVEN THAT THE OWNERSHIP THERE'S ALSO PROBABLY SOME SOME LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY THEY'RE GIVEN THEIR OWNERSHIP AND THAT THEN THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY OF. OF WHAT HAPPENS AS THE AS THE LEAD SHRINKS. THE STATE HAS COMMITTED TO BE. TAKE THE LEAD ROLE. THAT THAT THAT IS. HOW THE STATE CHOSE TO APPROACH IT BUT IT DOES SEEM LIKE THERE'S THERE'S ROOM FOR FEDERAL ROLE HERE'S FROM? THE KIDS. THANK YOU WAS GREAT THAT HE ONE OF THE PRISONERS MIGHT BE ABLE TO SHED SOME LIGHT. ON THE. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S COMPONENT TO A TO ALL THIS IN SOME OF THE EFFORTS THAT ARE UNDERWAY AS WE SPEAK. DARNED THE OTHER QUESTIONS FOR MYSELF THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR OVERVIEW WILL ASK THE. PANEL TO A PRISONER SCOTT WILSON TED FRANK AND BRUCE WILCOX. THAT'S PLEASE COME FORWARD. AND MISTER WILSON IS WITH ITS OWN SEE PROGRAM MANAGER. I LOVE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. TED FRANK IS A BRANCH CHIEF ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION ENHANCEMENT DIVISION. GOV ON DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. AND BRUCE WILCOX'S USES THE SECRETARY. SONGS HE POLICY. FOR CALIFORNIA NATURISTS ARSES AGENCY WELCOME JIM. WHAT TAKE YOU IN THAT THE SAME ORDER THAT YOU WERE LISTED? ON THE AGENDA. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY MAYBE. FOR. YEAH I THINK THAT PUTS ME FIRST. GOOD MORNING CHAIR GARCIA COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS SCOTT WILSON AND I'M REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. THE THE PRIMARY ROLES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE RELATED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SALTON SEA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. ARE TO PROVIDE INPUT INTO THE HABITAT DESIGN PROCESS SO THE PROJECTS ARE DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE A MOSAIC FISH AND WILDLIFE HABITAT. ASSIST WITH THE PERMITTING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL MINIMIZATION MEASURES DURING PROJECT CONSTRUCTION. AND TO MANAGE THE HABITAT AND SPECIES MONITORING ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM FOR THE CONSTRUCTIVE HABITATS. WE PROVIDE EXPERTISE ON HABITAT FEATURES SUCH AS STRUCTURES FOR BIRD NESTING AND ROOSTING AND RANGE UPON DEPTHS FOR USE BY A VARIETY. OF FISH AND WILDLIFE SPECIES. IN CONSULTATION WITH OTHER SCIENTISTS THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE DEVELOP AND MANAGE MISSION WHILE LIKE MONITORING EFFORTS. TO ASSESS THE FUNCTIONS OF THE CREATED HABITAT. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH WILDLIFE ENGAGES IN THE SALTON SEA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM WITH PERSONNEL FROM OUR SACRAMENTO HEADQUARTERS LED BY DIRECTOR CHUCK BOTTOM IN OUR EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP TEAM. AND LOCALLY IN OUR INLAND DESERT REGION LED BY REGIONAL MANAGER LESLIE MCNAIR. THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE SOLVENCY PROGRAM IS BASED IN THE COACHELLA VALLEY. JUST NORTH OF THE SALTON SEA. ABOUT THE PROGRAM MANAGER AND A TEAM OF SCIENTISTS COORDINATE PLAN. AND IMPLEMENT FISH AND WILDLIFE CONSERVATION ACTIONS AT THE PSALMS. I'M THE FORMER SOLVENCY PROGRAM MANAGER CURRENTLY THE CONSERVATION PLANNING MANAGER FOR INLAND DESERT'S REGION. DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WILDLIFE HAS ADVERTISED THE SALTON SEA PROGRAM MANAGER POSITION IN MARCH AND APRIL AND IS WORKING TO COMPLETE THE HIRING PROCESS. CONTINUE TO WORK WITH SECRETARY ASSISTANT SECRETARY WILCOX DEPARTMENT WATER RESOURCES. THAT LEAD THE FISH AND WILDLIFE SCIENTISTS TEAM. ACCORDING IT WITH OTHER AGENCIES SCIENTISTS AND LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS TO IMPLEMENT PROJECTS AT THE SALTON SEA DURING THE HIRING PROCESS. SO SPECIFIC TO THE IMPLEMENTATION. OF THE SALTON SEA PROJECTS. OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE HAS. PROVIDED GUIDANCE ON THE HABITAT DESIGN ELEMENTS. THAT WE ENGAGE IN ONGOING PLANNING AND CONSULTATIONS WITH DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. CURIEL IRRIGATION DISTRICT SALTON SEA AUTHORITY. AND OTHER AGENCIES AND SCIENTISTS TO BRING THE PROJECTS TO CONSTRUCTION. WE ARE CONDUCTING FISH AND WILDLIFE SURVEYS AND SAMPLING FOR PROPOSED PROJECTS. WE WILL ASSIST WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION MEASURES DURING THE INITIAL SITE WORK. SUCH AS MEASURES TO AVOID IMPACTS TO NESTING BIRDS AND MANAGE FOR THE ENDANGERED DESERT PUPFISH. IT WILL MANAGE THE MONITORING EFFORTS DURING PROJECT CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATIONS. DEPARTMENT FISH WILDLIFE CONTINUES COORDINATING WITH THE ADVISORY SCIENCE COMMITTEE. TO REFINE THE HABITAT DESIGN CRITERIA AND BUILD UPON THE MONITORING AND ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT PLAN. THAT WAS DEVELOPED FOR THE SPECIES CONSERVATION HABITAT PROJECT. TO PRODUCE A MONITORING APPROACH THAT COULD BE APPLICABLES TO ALL OF THE SALTON SEA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM PROJECTS. FOR THE PHASE ONE TEN YEAR PLAN. BOB THE SPECIES HABITAT CONSERVATION PROJECT IT WAS DESIGNED TO BE A PROOF OF CONCEPT. RECOGNIZING THE PROJECTS OF SIMILAR SCALE AND PURPOSEHAD NOT BEEN CONSTRUCTED OF THE. RELATED TO FISH AND WILDLIFE OUTCOMES. SUCH AS FACTORS AFFECTING FISH SURVIVAL AND HABITAT USED BY VARIOUS BIRD SPEAKS. CONSTRUCTION OF THESE INITIAL PROJECTS. AND MONITORING OF THE CONSTRUCTED HABITATS IS ESSENTIAL TO INFORM OUR SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING. OF HOW THESE HABITATS WILL FUNCTION. AND WHAT CHANGES MAYBE NEEDED IN FUTURE PROJECTS. FOR INCREASE THE BENEFITS TO FISH AND WILDLIFE. WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL THE AGENCIES AND STAKEHOLDERS TO SEE THAT THE HABITAT PROJECTS ARE CONSTRUCTED. TO MONITOR THE FISH AND WILDLIFE RESOURCES AND TO LEARN AND TO ADVISE FUTURE PROJECT DESIGN AND OPERATIONS. AND TO ACHIEVE THE MOST EFFECTIVE HABITAT OUTCOMES FOR FISH AND WILDLIFE DEPENDENT ON THE SALTON SEA ECOSYSTEM. RIGHT BRUCELLA GO AHEAD AND BUILD WRAP UP I GUESS SO. GOOD MORNING. CHAIRMAN GARCIA MY NAME'S TED FRANK WHO MEMBERS. NOT WITH THE DEPARTMENT WATER RESOURCES. YOU SHOULD HAVE A PACKET THE HANDOUTS. THAT'LL. WALK THROUGH AND WE HAVE ASSOCIATED LARGER PANEL. WHICH WERE SET UP TO BE. AVAILABLE YOU SEE FROM THE PUBLIC FOR YOURSELVES BUT WE'RE FACING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION BUT I SEE CAMERA OVER THERE SO MAYBE THIS'LL HELP. ON THAT SO WE'LL JUST FOLLOW FOLLOW THROUGH ON THE HANDOUTS. NUMBER. AND I'LL GIVE YOU A. BRIEF OVERVIEW. OF THE SALTON SEA THERE IS ARE COLLARED IN THIS IN THIS AREA ARE OUR FOCUS AREAS. FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF OF THE MITIGATION FOR HABITAT OR QUALITY. OF TREATMENTS THAT THE STATE HAS. COMMITTED TO IT FROM THE QUEUE I SAY. THESE ARE AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN. DEEMS TO BE THE AREAS THAT WILL EXPOSE THE MOST PLAYA OVER TIME AS THE CITY IS EXPECTED TO RECEDE SO THE USER. AREAS FOR THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH. AND THE AREAS THAT ARE FED BY THE MAJOR RIVER SYSTEMS THAT COME INTO THE SEA FILM. THAT IS AREAS THAT WILL BE FOCUSING ON. I'M GONNA BE ON MY OWN AND A WHITE AGAIN. RIGHT EITHER. THESE ARE THE FOCUSED AREAS OF OF THE EFFORTS NO BETWEEN OUR AGENCIES AND THEM. WAVE RANDOMLY NUMBERED THEM BUT THE THAT'S ROUGHLY THE PROGRESS OF OF PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION AT THE STATE. WILL BE FOLLOWING. AND THE SOUTH END OF THE CITY AROUND THE. ALAMO NEW RIVER ARE OUR FIRST AND A FOCUS AREAS AND I WAVE A JUST INITIATED. HOSSAM EFFORTS AT THE NORTH END OF SEE WITH SOME CO THORNY AROUND THE WHITE RIVER. SO THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES IS. BE CONSTRUCTION ARM OF THE STATE SO OUR ROOM ROLLER RESPONSIBILITY IN THE EFFORT IS THE. HOPE AND DO THE DESIGN OF PLANNING. AND THEN FINALLY GO INTO A CONSTRUCTION. HIRING PELICAN CONSULTING OR OR ENGINEERING FIRMS TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT WHATEVER ACTIONS WE AS A GROUP. DESIGNING COME UP WITH IN PARTNERSHIP WITH. NOT PART OF FISH WILDLIFE AND US FISH WILDLIFE SERVICE AND AND OUR PARTNERS THAT THE FEDERAL AGENCY LEVEL. HOME. WELL PHILIP DIVE INTO SOME DETAIL HERE. FOR EXAMPLE SOME OF THE DESIGN WORK THAT WE'VE. BEEN WORKING ON. ON ON A VERY FOCUSED LEVEL HAS BEEN AN AREA IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE CITY NEAR THE NEW RIVER. I'M AND THESE OUR. THE AREA THAT WE AT THE STATE DATA. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT AND REPORT TO THE JOINT DOCUMENT. FOR WHAT WAS THE IN THIS SPECIES CONSERVATION HOW WITHOUT NOSE UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE DEPARTMENT FISH AND WILDLIFE AS YOU HEARD FROM SCOTT. AND SO OUR ROLE IS TO BE ABLE TO WORK THROUGH THE DESIGN ASPECTS OF WHAT WOULD THE PAWNS AND HABITAT AREAS LOOK LIKE. AND WHERE WERE THEY MOST LIKELY BE. SCOTT ALSO REFERRED TO THIS BEING A PILOT PROJECT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE STATE AT ONE. AM ANYBODY ELSE'S NOT. ATTEMPTED TO BUILD ON ON THE PLAYA OF THE CITY. SO THIS IS A BIG LEARNING CURVE FOR FOR THE STATE EVERYBODY ELSE NAM. THE SCA AGE WAS THE PILOT PROJECT WE'RE GOING TO BE A PILOT PROJECT SO THE FIRST AREA THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY. FOCUS THEN IS THIS. AREA JUST TO THE EAST OF THE NEW RIVER. TOM LET. LABEL THE THE NEW RIVER EAST RIGHT NOW A MESSY AGE. THIS IS GONNA BE SIX HUNDRED FORTY ACRES OF THE CURRENTLY. IS PLANNED DOUBTS WE. WORKED WITH DUCKS UNLIMITED AND FOLKS. AVENGER OTHER ENGINEERING EXPERTISE THAT HAVE BUILT. WHAT ONES SIMILAR TO THIS BEFORE SO? WE DIDN'T PRETEND TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS WE WANTED TO REACH OUT AND GET THE EXPERTISE THAT WAS ALREADY. A AVAILABLE THROUGH THE STATE SO WE. HAVE UTILIZED. ENGINEERS FROM THE DUCKS UNLIMITED GROUP TO HELP ADVISE AND AND COME UP WITH PLANS AND THEN. OUR DIVISION OF ENGINEERING. AT THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. ARE THE ENGINEERS THAT HAVE REFINED AND BROUGHT THE INITIAL DESIGNS INTO THIS COMPLIANCE WITH STATE. REQUIREMENTS AFTER CONTRACTING PURPOSES. AND SO WE EXPECT THIS. AT THE FIRST STAGE AS THE AGE SIX HUNDRED FORTY ACRES THAT'S THE POINT TO BE OUR FIRST PROJECT. ON THE GROUND. WE'VE BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY WITH THOSE LANDOWNERS WHICH IS I. ID IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE. AND OUR LEGAL OFFICE AND ID'S LEGAL OFFICE HAVE BEEN WORKING. HARD TO COME UP WITH AN EASEMENT AGREEMENT. BETWEEN OUR TWO. AGENCIES SO THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO THE PROPERTY AND BE ABLE TO CONSTRUCT. THE WORK ON THEIR IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ID SO. THAT WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING THAT STARTED. RIGHT NOW WERE. EXPECTING. SOMEWHERE AROUND DECEMBER OF THIS YEAR. TO IMPLEMENT THAT FIRST. CONSTRUCTION ACTION. SO. THAT'S. WILL BE COMING UP. IN JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL. THE THING ABOUT. SO. THIS LOCATION. IS S. B. SIX CONSERVATION SIX HUNDRED FORTY ACRE PROJECT THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW. THE OTHER. PARTS OF THIS PROJECT AS YOU CAN SEE WE'VE ALREADY THOUGHT INTO THE FUTURE HAS THAT CEOS RECEDING WHERE ELSE ARE WE GOING TO BE ABLE TO. I'M. BUILD THE NEXT PLOT LINES AND OR WHAT AND HABITAT. AND NOT DRY MITIGATION SO AIR. QUALITY DUST MITIGATION ASPECT. I KNOW THEY HAVEN'T A STIPULATED ORDER FROM THE STATE WATER BOARD. WE HAVE. ANNUAL OBLIGATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN LAID OUT. OF THOSE ANNUAL OBLIGATIONS UP TO FIFTY PERCENT OR WITH NO LESS THAN FIFTY PERCENT HOUSE TO BE. HABITAT OF AQUATIC HABITAT OF SORT. BEYOND THAT OR ANYTHING AFTER THAT CAN ALSO BE DRY MITIGATION. SO. YOU'LL SEE A MOSAIC HERE WHERE WE'RE CURRENTLY THINKING AREAS THAT. POTENTIALLY WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FORUM DRIVE MEDICATION. AS WELL AS. PLUMMET AREAS THAT WOULD. WORK THEIR WAY DOWN PLAN AS THE C. RECEDES. NAM. SO WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO A CONTINUING PLANNING ON THOSE OTHER AREAS BEYOND THE SIX FOR SIX HUNDRED FORTY ACRES. WHICH WILL LEAD US TOWARDS THAT TIME. ANNUAL TARGETS STIPULATED IN THE IN THE AGREEMENT FROM THE WATER BOARD. THERE IS ONE MORE DESIGN AT ALL. THAT IS NOT IN YOUR HANDOUT BUT ALL. I'LL PUT UP A BOARD. FOR REFERENCE. THINGS. ONE OF THE OTHER PROJECTS THAT WE'VE BEEN. UGH WORKING ON WITH ID AND A GEOTHERMAL RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT GROUP. REFERRED REFERRED TO A CITY ARE. THEY HAVE. LEASEPLAN FROM MY AB OVER THIS PART OF THE PROPERTY THIS IS ACTUALLY. OR MAYBE AT THE ALCOTT WELL AS WELL AND PROJECT ITS ON THE NEW RIVER. AND THE IDEA THERE IS AGAIN COMING UP WITH. PONDING AREA THAT'S WILL CREATES WETLAND HABITAT PROTECTING AND A COUPLE OF THE ENDANGERED SPECIES. OF CATFISH AND. THE RAIL THE CALIFORNIA RAIL. THAT OCCUPY THAT SPACE. WORKING WITH IDEA THEY HAVE THEM OBLIGATIONS WHILE FOR BUT FISH NOT PROTECTIONS AND SO WERE. WORKING WITH THEM TO DESIGN AN AREA WHERE THEY ARE OBLIGATED TO CONNECT DRAINS THAT HAVE PUT FISH POPULATIONS IN. M. AND THAT FEATURE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A DRINK CONNECTION SYSTEM IN THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT. ULTIMATELY WHAT WE'RE ALSO OBLIGATED TO DO IS NOT PRECLUDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES IN THE AREA SO WHAT WERE. WORKING WITH THE GEOTHERMAL GROUP IS IS TO FIND OUT WHAT AREAS THEY. I'D NEED OR DESIRE TO HAVE ACCESS TO IN ORDER TO EXPLORE. AND DEVELOP GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES IN THIS VICINITY SO THAT'S PARTLY. DEFINING THE BOUNDARIES OF WHAT THIS PROPERTY AND OUR OUR HABITAT FEATURE MY LOOK LIKE HERE. SO THAT'S BEEN A GOOD PARTNERSHIP IT'S MORE WORKING THROUGH THE DETAILS IN THE DESIGN LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE THE DOUBLES ARE IN THE DETAILS. BUT THEM THAT'S GOING GOING WELL. AND WE EXPECT THAT. TO BE ACTUALLY OUR FIRST PROJECT UNDER A DIFFERENT. CONTRACTING PROCESS. AND THAT'S A THERE'S A DETAIL THERE THE. THE LEGISLATURE HERE AUTHORIZES THE DEPARTMENT A NEW. AUTHORITY DID TO CONSTRUCT WHICH IS CALLED DESIGN BUILD AUTHORITY. PREVIOUSLY THE APARTMENT IS ONLY HAD DESIGNED BID BUILD. WHERE WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH A HUNDRED PERCENT DESIGN FEET FEATURES BEFORE WE CAN GO OUT THE CONTRACT? UNDER NE FISHING GAME CODE WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE AUTHORITY. NOT CALL DESIGN BUILD WHICH WILL ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT TO GO INTO A CONTRACT WITH THE DESIGN. INSTRUCTION FIRM AND WORK IN PARTNERSHIP. TO DEVELOP DESIGNS AND IMPLEMENT AS THOSE DESIGNS ARE COMPLETED. SO WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN WORK THROUGH THAT NEW PROCESS AND COME UP WITH A MORE EFFICIENT WAY TO GET OUT THE CONTRACT. UPPER PROJECTS. SO DOT IS ONE WAY THAT THE STATE IS SEEN TO BE ABLE TO MAKE. CONSTRUCTION HAPPEN A LITTLE FASTER IDEALLY. DOWN THERE SO PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT BEING ABLE TO MAKE BALLOTS THAT HAPPEN. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH I'D IN THESE OTHER COMPANIES SO. I'M. I WILL. LEAVE IT AT THAT MAN BRUCE FULL. ALRIGHT IF ANY QUESTIONS AND BE A WHAT WILL HOLD UP ON THE QUESTIONS. AFTER MISTER WILLCOX PRESENTATIONS OF. SADNESS WILCOX'S THAT TIME IT. AND I'M LIKE LIKE THIS PANEL UP LET'S THAT SIR AND YEAH LET'S GET SOME. EXCITEMENT GOING ON HERE AID BECAUSE I'VE GOT A LONG LIST OF QUESTIONS AS WELL. THAT THAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GET INTO I'M SURE SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES. MIGHT HAVE SOME QUESTIONS AS WELL I SHOULD MAKE THE TESTIMONY AS LONG AS PASSED THE AYE. WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS HAVE QUESTIONS AND GOING AWAY ARM. I THINK TED PROVIDED A LOT OF THE DETAIL I WAS YOU ARE THE. LIGHT OF THE OVERVIEW THAT I WAS GONNA PROVIDE. BUT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF THINGS. PARDON ME. ANOTHER REMEMBER BACK WHEN WE STARTED THIS. ARE THE SONGS HE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM ABOUT TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO. THERE WAS THIS GRAVE CONCERN ABOUT THE NEED FOR. SOME IMMEDIATE ACTION OF THE SONGS. THERE WAS ALSO CONCERN ABOUT A LONG RANGE PLAN FOR THE SOLVENCY. THOSE TWO DON'T GO TOGETHER VERY WELL IMMEDIATE ACTION ON LONG RANGE PLAN. SOLELY BIFURCATED THE PROCESS. AND TO TO. SEGMENTS ONE AS OF THE TEN YEAR PLAN. WHICH WAS APPROVED BY THE. WATER POURED. ALONG WITH A STIPULATED ORDER AND THE OTHER IS A LONG RANGE PLAN THAT WE ARE WORKING ON NOW. AND WILL ENCOMPASS THE ENTIRE CITY AND WILL LOOK AT. ARE THINGS LIKE WATER IMPORT ON NEXT WEEK. WEEK AFTER NEXT. A WERE HAD WE HAVE A PUBLIC MEETING WITH THE. IMPERIAL COUNTY ON THOSE. WATER IMPORT PROJECTS. AND THE GOAL OF THAT IS TRYING TO DEFINE SOME THAT ARE. DIDN'T MAKE THEM. WITH FIT THE CRITERIA WE HAVE FOR. COST. I IMPLEMENT HOW FAST WE CAN IMPLEMENT THEM. WHAT KIND OF ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTATION Y. NATICK SACHA? SO THAT WILL START THE REVIEW OF. THE LONG RANGE PLAN THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE LONG RANGE PLAN WILL BE A WATER IMPORT PLAN. QUITE FRANKLY. RIGHT NOW IT'S DESIGNED AS A SMALLER BUT SUSTAINABLE CITY PLAN. THAT HAS. THE. ACCOUNTS FOR THE. EXPOS PLAYA YOU SAW. TED TALK ABOUT ALL OF THAT EXPOSED FLY AROUND THE SOLVENCY. NOW IT WILL BE BUILT SO THAT THE LONG RANGE PLAN IF IT'S WATER IMPORT. CAN STILL BE BUILT IN OTHER WORDS WILL BUILD THE. THE ARM. THE BURNS HIGH ENOUGH THAT WE CAN DO EITHER ONE. THAT. COSTS A LITTLE MORE QUITE FRANKLY. IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO ENGINEER BUT IT GIVES US THE FLEXIBILITY WE NEED LATER. GIVEN THAT WE ARE. WE HAVEN'T MADE A DECISION A LONG RANGE PLAN TO THIS POINT. ONE OF THE OTHER COMMENTS WAS EARLIER WAS FEDERAL FUNDING. AND WE HAVE A MINOR AMOUNT OF FEDERAL FUNDING. WE HAVE AN AMMO YOU SIGNED WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. FOR. MAY NOT HAVE MADE THE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS FOR THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. THREE MILLION A YEAR PLUS OR MINUS WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY MONEY FROM THAT AGREEMENT CHAIR. ONE OF THE THINGS YOU KNOW. EARLIER WAS ASKED WHAT COULD THE STATE LEGISLATURE DO. ONE OF THE THINGS THE STATE LEGISLATURE MIGHT CONSIDER. HIS LOOSENING THE RULES AND PROPOSITION MONIES. NOW THESE ARE OF THIS IS A WISH LIST AND I DON'T KNOW HOW. HOW OF WHETHER OR NOT? THOSE SORT OF THINGS CAN BE DONE. BUT IF YOU REALLY IF YOU RELAX THE RULES ON. PROPOSITION MONEY YOU COULD SPEND A LITTLE BIT MORE OF THAT TIME. OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE WHICH IS. OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE TO BUILD THIS. PUT OUT A PRETTY ROBUST OPERATION MAINTENANCE PROGRAM. ARE I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT TOO ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF THE. A GROUP THAT'S WORKING CANONISTS UNFORTUNATELY. HA SCAT IS LEAVING US. AND LOTS WE GET THE LOCKS CHANGED ON THE DOOR BEFORE HE CAN TURN BEFORE IT GETS THERE. BUT. WE HAVE M. PROCESS. TO IDENTIFY A NEW REPLACEMENT SCAT HAS PROMISED TO HELP UNTIL THAT REPLACEMENT COMES ON BOARD. OH THERE WAS A LOT ACCOMPLISHED AT THE DFW OFFICES. IN THE LIKE THE TIME SCOUT WAS THERE WE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS AND HABITAT. AND DONE PERMITTING AND OTHER THINGS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN SO. WE ARE UNKNOWN. VERY GRATEFUL CATTLEYA FOR HIS EFFORTS. A TED IS IS BEEN WORKING ON THIS PROJECT LONGER THAN I HAVE I THINK. A AND HAD HIS GROUP HAS PROVIDED THAT SAME LEVEL OF SUPPORTER. AND CONTINUES THROUGH PROVIDE THAT SAME LEVEL OF SUPPORT. THEY ARE ONE PERSON CHARTER. ALSO BUT I THINK ARE IN THE PROCESS OF FILLING THAT POSITION. SO LET'S SAY WITHIN THREE TO SIX MONTHS THOSE POSITIONS WILL LOBBY FILLED. I'M WILL HAVE A FULL CONTINGENCY OF PEOPLE. NOW AS WE GET. AS WE START TO RAMP THIS UP. THEY'RE PROBABLY THEY'RE NOT PROBABLY THERE WILL BE MORE THAN ONE PROJECT GOING AT THE SAME TIME. LEADER FROM A DESIGN PERSPECTIVE. OR A DESIGN AND BUILD PERSPECTIVE OR BOTH. AND WE PROBABLY WILL NEED MORE PEOPLE. AT THAT POINT IN TIME TO DEAL WITH. BUT OVER TED SHOULDER YOU CAN SEE. WHERE THE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE? OF. THE. DEPUTY EARLY. AND THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR. ALONE AND THE DIRECTOR ARE LISTED FOR WATER RESOURCES. AND THAT'S JUST NOT. THAT'S JUST NOT A NAME UP THERE CINDY IN PARTICULAR IS VERY INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS HELPING US. GET THROUGH SOME OF THE. HICKS TODAY PICKUPS AND MANY. PROCESS WOULD DEAL WE THERE'S ALWAYS SOME ISSUES YOU GOT INTO. SOLVE INTERNALLY. I AM. SAME WAY WITH JEANNIE CUDDLE IN GENERAL THEY'VE BEEN VERY HELPFUL ON THE DEVELOPMENT. HA HA OF THE PLAN WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THAT SPLATTER WE'RE GRATEFUL TO THEM FOR THAT TED FRINGS GROUP. ERIC COKE HAN HA. HEART. A NOT SO MUCH CHARGE BUT ERIC HAS BEEN INVOLVED AND. AGAIN THE IDEA OF HAVING HIGH LEVEL PEOPLE IN THE ORGANIZATION HAVE DEVELOPED. TO HELP US MAKE DECISIONS AND TO HELP US HARM. GET THROUGH HANA STICKING POINTS OR. OTHER POINTS IN THE PROCESS THAT IT SIX MONTHS AGO WERE DEFEATING US. AND THERE ARE NO LONGER DOING AND WE HAVE. AND THEN EVEN FURTHER SAID TO MOVE THAT ALONG. AND IT'S NOT ON THIS ONE FED. NARM WE HAVE A. A COORDINATION PERSON THAT WORKS BETWEEN DO WE. ANDY W. ARE IN DFW. AND WOOD WORKS THE SAME WAY WHETHER CONSULTING TEAM. TWO HA GET THROUGH THE DOE REQUIREMENTS THE DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS THERE. ARE BASED ON PRETTY MUCH HARDSCAPE. THIS IS NOT HARDSCAPE SO. ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS ADJUST. REQUIREMENTS SUCH THAT. SUCH THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD THROUGH THE PROCESS FASTER DON'T HAVE A LOT OF THE REVIEW PROCESS. THEN FINALLY. WE HAVE HAD SOME ISSUES WITH EASEMENTS. I AM HAPPY TO SAY THAT WE HAVE. I THINK. I DON'T THINK I KNOW. WE'VE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS IN THAT. AND THERE IS A HALF A DOZEN. MEETINGS SCHEDULED OVER THE NEXT COURSE OF THE NEXT MONTH OR SO. TO FINISH THE EASEMENT ISSUE. ONCE WE FINISH THESE MINUTES TO ON THE. SPECIES CONSERVATION HEALTHCARE PROJECT WILL USE THAT AS A. EXAMPLE FOR THE OTHER. HE IS A MUSLIM THE OTHER IS NOW THE LAW DIFFER SLIGHTLY. BUT THEY'LL THEY'LL BE A. PROCESS FOR DEVELOPING OZZY'S AND. AND PARTICULARLY WITH DESIGN BILL. THAT PROCESS WILL INCLUDE SOME KIND OF. PHASED APPROACH TO E. IS IMMENSE. THERE WHERE. WE LOOK AT AT A YOUNG DESIGNED BILL ALLOWS YOU TO GET STARTED EARLIER BUT IT DOES LOOK. IT DOES REQUIRE ENGINEERING TO DO THAT. SO WE'LL LOOK AT HOW BEST. WE. INTEGRATE THAT INTO THE SYSTEM. HOW BEST WE CAN INTEGRATE A PAUSE IN THE SYSTEM AND A COUPLE OF POINTS I HAD A COUPLE OF POINTS? TO ALLOW PUBLIC INPUT PUBLIC. OUTREACH. AND THERE ARE A LOT OF SOME REVIEW TIME BUT I AYE ID. ID'S PARTICULARLY CONCERNED BECAUSE THIS IS. PART OF THEIR DRAINAGE SYSTEM OF. I CONCERN VERY VALID KNOW THEY NEED KEYPAD DRAINAGE SYSTEM OPERATED. I THINK. THAT'S ABOUT ALL ON. THE. POINTS ARE MAKE AND I'M. AGAIN I'M JUST VERY PLEASED TO THE AMOUNT OF PROGRESS THESE GENTLEMEN HAVE MADE OVER THE. LAST FEW MONTHS. THANK YOU BRUCE. AND THANK YU TO TO PALACE I KNOW YOU ARE AWARE THAT THE. HEARING IS BEING TELEVISED OUT FOR STREAMLINED AND THAT WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PEOPLE LOCALLY. THAT ARE WATCHING THIS HEARING. AND AS MUCH AS THEY WOULD LIKE ME TO. LIGHT UP YOU KNOW THE PRESENTERS HERE. THAT ARE HERE TODAY AND ALTHOUGH THAT'S NOT MY STYLE I THINK I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT I EXPRESSED YOU. ATHEISTS HIGH LEVEL OF FRUSTRATION. THAT IS BEING CONVEYED TO ME AS A PEOPLE OR CHIMING IN ON THE. FACEBOOK Y. DEAL THEN THE TEXT MESSAGING. AS IT RELATES TO JUST THE ARM CHALLENGE IN UNDERSTANDING YOU KNOW OF THE PROCESS THAT YOU WHILE JUST. EXPLAINED AND BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY I THINK WHAT PEOPLE ARMED THERE WATCHING AND PERHAPS EVEN THOSE THAT ARE HERE. UP THEY WANT TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THEM THE ACTION STEPS AS IT RELATES TO WHEN WE START SEEING SOME CONSTRUCTION. OUT THERE AND I KNOW YOU YOU'VE GIVEN THIS OF A VAGUE OVERVIEW OF WHERE WE'RE AT VAGUE MEANING IN THE SENSE THAT WHEN DO WE GET TO THE BEGINNING OF REACHING THE FIRST CALL WHICH IS FIVE HUNDRED. PIRATE ACRES OF PROJECTS UNDER CONSTRUCTION BY DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ACCORDING TO THE ALLEY OFFICE. WORK WORK WORK BEHIND ALREADY ON THAT PARTICULAR PORTION THE FACT THAT WE'RE HEARING THAT THERE ARE POSITIONS THAT ARE GOING TO NO LONGER BE FILLED AND IT'LL BE A FEW MONTHS BEFORE WE ACTUALLY FILL THOSE. ROLES THAT IN ITSELF CREATES A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF CONCERN AS IT RELATES TO THE TIMELINE THAT WE HAVE. MOVING FORWARD AND SO AS MUCH AS THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU KNOW WHAT WE GET TO SEE ON. C-SPAN AND OTHER PLACES WHERE WE HAD THE DIRECTORS OF AGENCIES JUST GETTING LIT UP FOR NOT ANSWERING QUESTIONS OR WHAT NOT I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT. BUT I'M CERTAINLY GOING TO ASK THAT WE REALLY GIVE US SOME REALLY POINTED ANSWERS TO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I BY GOTTEN HERE BEFORE. OF MYSELF AND I'M SURE SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES MAY HAVE SOME QUESTIONS AS WELL. SO I GUESS THE FIRST THING IS HOW ARE WE GOING TO TRY TO MAKE UP FOR THEM A. TIMEFRAME THAT'S BEEN SET UP AND THAT THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD HAS SAID SOME SOME BENCHMARKS FOR US TO MEET. GIVEN THAT WE YOU HAVE SOME TOOLS THAT DESIGN BUILD COMPONENT TO BE ABLE TO CATCH UP. A AND WHEN WILL WE SEE THE FIRST A CONSTRUCTION I KNOW YOU MENTIONED THE MAYBE AT THE END OF THE YEAR BUT IS THERE SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO. TO EXPEDITE SOME OF THAT PROCESS IN THE AISLE THAT ANYONE WHO WANTS TO TAKE A STAB AT THAT QUESTION. A JUMP RIGHT IN A PICK THE FIRST. THINK. WE WILL START CONCERT BY. HIS BIGGEST TO THE MICROPHONE FIRST PLAY WILL ALSO WON'T WE WILL START CONSTRUCTION BY DECEMBER. WHO THE WATER ORDER DOES GIVE US A SECOND YEAR? TO HIT CAUGHT UP INTO SUPERIOR THE FIRST YEAR SO. WOULD BE HARD TO KEEP UP BECAUSE. OF THE SIZE OF THE PROJECT TO TAKE SEVERAL YEARS TO BUILD THE PROJECT. ONCE YOU'VE GOT A BILL THAT THEATER NINE HUNDRED ACRES. BUT UNTIL YOU GET A BILL THAT DOESN'T COUNT TOWARDS THE. A TOTAL SO WE HAVE TWO YEARS. ARE WE ARE IN THE PROCESS RIGHT NOW OF DEVELOPING. WERE REQUIRED TO DEVELOP. A PLAN FOR TO GET CAUGHT UP. YOU SAW OF THE WHAT. TED CALLED THE ALCOTT ROAD PROJECT THAT'S ONE OF THE ANSWERS TO. HOW DO WE SPEED UP AND HOW DO WE MOVE THIS FORWARD? ARM. THE. I THINK THEY'RE FROM FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF. OF THE LEGISLATURE YOU FOLKS HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY SUPPORTIVE. AND PROVIDING. FUNDING AND HABITAT. CAN I DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC. REQUIREMENTS OF THE LEGISLATURE THERE ARE SUGGESTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE AT THIS POINT. I THINK HEARINGS LIKE THIS HELP BECAUSE THEY DO PUT US ON. NOTICE THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD. I THINK INVOLVING OUR PARTNERS IN THE HEARING IS IS ALSO A GREAT IDEA. MOVING FORWARD. I IDEA IN THE LAST MONTH OR SO. TWO LINES HAS BEEN VERY VERY HELPFUL. YEAH AND MOVING. OF AN S. C. H. NSCA JUST SORT OF THE CORNERSTONE. OF THE PROJECTS MOVING FORWARD SO. THAT'S THE PROJECT TO GET STARTED IN DECEMBER. THAT'S OUR FIRST PROJECT. AND THEN WE MOVED TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THEM SLIMMY ASK A QUESTION BECAUSE WE ARE AB. DELAYED ALREADY WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A PROJECT OR THAT PROJECT. DOES THAT AUTOMATICALLY DELAY US FROM MOVING FORWARD WITH OTHER PROJECTS THAT ARE WITHIN THE. MANAGEMENT PLAN. IT DOESN'T AND WE HAVE THE NORTH LAKE THAT WE IS A RELATIVELY NEW PROJECTS. PROMOTED BY RIVERSIDE COUNTY. AND TO SOME EXTENT BY THE. SOUND SEE AT THE ORGAN. AND WERE WORKING ON THE DESIGN OF THAT AS WE SPEAK. HABITAT OF THE WEST OF THE RIVER. WILL BE DESIGNED AND WE'RE WORKING ON THAT AS WE SPEAK. AS I MENTIONED THE ALCOTT WETLAND. IS BEING DEVELOPED. RIGHT NOW WHILE WE'RE STILL WORKING THROUGH THESE MENDACIOUS NOW ALL OF THOSE HAVE THESE MONEY ISSUES. BUT ONCE WE GET ONE WORKED OUT I THINK WE CAN. WORKOUT THE OTHERS FASTER THERE'S ALSO A. NORTH IN PROJECT WITH TORRES MARTINEZ. THAT HANNAH HAD ACTUALLY HAS THE BENEFIT OF NOT HAVING QUITE AS MANY. REGULATIONS ATTACHED TO IT. AND WE'RE MOVING FORWARD WITH. I GETTING HOME PAYS RENTS FOR THAT SO THAT WE CAN. SO WE CAN EXTEND TENURE TO BUILD HARD TO BUILD THINGS WHILE WE'RE WAITING TO FINIAL FINALIZE. SOME OF THE ISSUES ON THE LARGER SCALE PROJECTS. OKAY I WANTED TO. ASK THE QUESTION AS IT RELATES TO THE EASEMENTS BECAUSE YOU'VE MENTIONED THAT A COUPLE TIMES AND I THINK ON THE GROUND. IT'S BEEN. SAID THAT THERE'S IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT. TO COME TO AN UNDERSTANDING WITH THE OTHER PARTNERS ARE AGENCIES INVOLVED IN THIS CAN YOU TELL US WHAT HAS BEEN THE CHALLENGE. AND WHAT IT IS THAT. WEEKEND SET UP IN PLACE TO TRY TO AVOID OR ELIMINATE THESE TYPES OF. LONG LASTING NO NEGOTIATIONS ARE DELAYING. REALLY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A PROJECT. THE BIGGEST DELAY HAS BEEN A ESTABLISHING LIABILITY. FOR THE EXISTING PLY AND NOT THE PROJECTS. AND OBVIOUSLY IDEA WOULD LIKE. THAT LIABILITY COVERAGE AN OBVIOUSLY. WERE NOT TOO ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT GIVING WE DON'T MIND. GIVING IT ON THE PROJECTS THAT'S A LITTLE BIT. TOUGHER FOR US TO GIVE US. I ABILITY UNDER EXISTING. CLAIMS OUT THERE ARE EXISTING PROBLEMS OUT THERE. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THE LEGISLATURE COULD DO. HERE'S PASSED SOME KIND OF LIMITATION. OUR TIME. APPLY A PROJECTS INSOLVENCY PROJECTS. THE TAKE TOOK THAT LIABILITY ISSUE AWAY. DOES THE LIABILITY THAT THE STATE HAS BY THE SIGN NEAR THE CUBA SAY NOT. CLEARLY MAKE IT THAT STATE LIABILITY ISSUE THEREFORE THIS BACK AND FORTH WITH AYE ID WOULD BE REALLY. NOT AVOID IT IT RELATED TO THE PROJECT THAT DOES. RELATED TO EXISTING CONDITIONS THAT THE SOUND CITY. OUR ATTORNEYS BELIEVE IT DOES NOT. AND THAT'S THE CERCLA CONCERNS. ON APPLY OF PREVIOUS. TOM. CONTAMINATION WITH PESTICIDES HERBICIDES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I MEAN IT MAYBE I MAYBE BECAUSE I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY I AM I MISSING THE THE. POINT THERE. BUT THE END IN THE BIG PICTURE I MEAN WE HAVE A HUGE LIABILITY OUT THERE. THAT ULTIMATELY FALLS ON THE SIDE OF THE STATE AND IF WERE GOING BACK AND FORTH ON THIS TYPE OF UP. DETAILED MAY BE OF SIGNIFICANCE. I MAYBE IT'S NOT REGISTERING WITH ME I THINK WE'RE PUTTING. AT RISK A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF LIABILITY THAT WE HAVE OUT THERE. BY THE SIMPLE FACT OF HAVING IT NEGOTIATED A NEEDS MET RIGHT AWAY AND. MAYBE I'M MISSING SOMETHING HERE BECAUSE I THINK WELL I I DON'T I THINK I DID A BAD JOB OF EXPLAINING. THERE ARE SOME STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS FOR OF THE STATE. WHEN IT COMES THE LIABILITY. AND THOSE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS ARE WAS GETTING IN THE WAY. SO IS THAT AN AREA THAT WE. COULD TAKE A LOOK AT IT BECAUSE AS YOU JUST MENTIONED ONCE WE GET THIS ONE EASEMENT ISSUE. IN PLACE. THAT WILL SEPARATE STUDENT MOVING FORWARD ARE WE GONNA HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS PROJECT BY PROJECT. AS WE GO THROUGH THE MANAGEMENT PLAN. THAT'LL SET PRECEDENT MOVING FORWARD NOW HAVING SAID THAT. EACH PROJECT WILL HAVE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT NEW I'M STILL. BUT THE ISSUE OF LIABILITY. WELL HAVE BEEN DEALT. WHAT'S THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF KIND OF DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE LIKE WHO WHO GETS TO MOVE ON TO TAKE THE LEAD ON THIS AND HOW DO WE ACTUALLY. SET SOME BENCHMARKS TO BE ABLE TO MEET SOME OF THESE CALLS AND SAY WE'VE GOT TWENTY FIVE DAYS THIRTY DAYS TO FIGURE THIS OUT BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT. CHALLENGE BEFORE IS WHAT WHAT IS THAT SYSTEM LOOK LIKE. THE DWI ATTORNEY. AND MYSELF AND ITS DELIBERATELY LIMITED TO A COUPLE PEOPLE. I HAD AYE ID'S REQUEST AND AND I REQUEST MAKES MORE SENSE TO HAVE. ONE OR TWO PEOPLE NEGOTIATING SOMETHING LIKE THIS NINE FIVE OR SIX. ARE FROM MARS. SCHEDULE POINT OF VIEW. I THINK WE BOTH BOTH AGENCIES ARE. PLANNING TO HAVE THIS DONE BY THE END OF MAY. WE HAVE PROBABLY FLOOR. MAYBE FOR A I THINK FOR MEETINGS BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF MAY. ALL DAY MEETINGS. TO RESOLVE THIS I JUST WENT THROUGH. ONE OF THOSE ALL DAY MEETINGS HE OTHER DAY. I HAVE A NEW APPRECIATION FOR ATTORNEYS AND THEIR PATIENTS. AND. THEN HOW MUCH THEY MAKE. WELL BECAUSE THAT'S I MEAN WE WE WE WE WE'RE GONNA SPEND LOT OF MONEY ON. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT EVEN RIGHT AWAY I MEAN WE. PART OF THE ALLEY O. REPORT SAYS WE WE STILL HAVE SOME WAYS TO GO TO. BE ABLE TO MEET THE OVERALL. FUNDING OBLIGATIONS WERE WHERE WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE THAT YOU KNOW PROP SIXTY EIGHT IS IN GOOD POSITION TO POSSIBLY BASS. THE BUT. BALLOT THAT IN NOVEMBER WILL SET US UP BUT THAT'S. MAYBE WELL LOT OF MAYBE MONEY ON THE TABLE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLAN AND THAT'S THAT DOESN'T GIVE ME A LOT OF. CONFIDENCE IN SO I AM YOU KNOW I'M I'M BEING FACETIOUS ABOUT THAT CHINESE BUT. THE FACT IS THAT YOU KNOW IT IS COSTING US MONEY AND TIME TO BE ABLE TO GET TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLAN AND I AM IS OF A BIG CONCERT LOTS OF MONEY. THAT. WE SET ASIDE TWENTY ANY OTHER CHALLENGES THAT WE NEED TO. BE TAKING A LOOK AT BEFORE DECEMBER CONSTRUCTION BEGINS AND WE RUN INTO A SITUATION WHERE IT'S LIKE WE DIDN'T ANTICIPATE THAT MULTIMILLION HE. OUT WE WON'T START CONSTRUCTION UNTIL TWO DOZEN NINETEEN I MEAN JANIE THING THAT WE NEED TO BE PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION TO. OUT RIGHT NOW. NOT THAT I'M. COMING TO MIND RIGHT NOW THAT THE DESIGN BUILD PROCESS AUTHORITY THAT WE HAVE IS IS I THINK OUR BASS. BATS FOR MOVING THINGS FORWARD AND HAS. JUST TO POINT OUT I MEAN YOU GUYS HAVE THE REFERENCE LOVE OF THE LAND HOLDINGS IN AUTHORITIES THERE. AND IT. THE STATE DOESN'T HAVE AUTHORITY OVER MUCH IF ANY OF THESE LAND YEAH IT'S ALL GONNA REQUIRED THOSE NEGOTIATIONS. AND CERTAINLY IN THE SOUTH AND THE NORTH AND SEE ITS I ID AT W. TRIBAL ENGAGEMENT. THOSE PROCESSES ARE JUST GONNA BE WHAT WE HAVE TO WORK THROUGH I THINK ALBUM. THE. THE MAKING PROGRESS IN GETTING THAT COMFORT BELT THAT A BETWEEN PARTNERSHIPS I THINK IS GONNA GO ON WAYS. WE MIGHT LOOK AT. WAYS THAT WE CAN SHORTEN OUR STREAMLINE. THE BIDDING PROCESS WE DO HAVE SOME GETTING. INVOLVED IN THIS AND WE DON'T WANT TO GIVE UP THE. OPTION FOR BED OVER DESIGN. BILL WHAT'S PREVENTING US FROM DOING THAT. NOTHING. WE JUST THINK THAT DESIGN BUILD THIS FASTER. BUT LET'S SAY SOMETHING. THAT. CAUSES. HOUSE TO. CAUSES US TO HAVE A DELAY IN THE DESIGN BUILD PROCESS. HOW WE COULD FALL BACK AND THE DESIGN SAID FILLED PROCESS? AND IF WE HAD SOME TIME. SOME ABILITY TO SHORTEN THE TIME. HOW THE ADVERTISEMENT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL? IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT DOING NOW HOURS AT UP TO WERE WAITING I THINK WE SHOULD. DO YOU NEED DIRECTION FROM. SOMEONE ELSE DO YOU NEED DAHLE OUR INSISTENCE AND PUSHING THAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WOULD IT REQUIRED TO MOVE. IN THAT DIRECTION IT SOUNDS LIKE WE KNOW THAT THAT WILL HELP US. SHORTEN THE TIMEFRAME. WILL LOOK TO SEE IF IT MYERS WELL. USE IT TAKE QUESTIONS COLLEAGUE. AND I APOLOGIZE I JUST WALKED IN BUT IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM LIKE. I JUST IN THE BRIEF TIME THAT ARE HERE THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY GETTING ANY ANSWERS. THE CHAIRS ASKING YOU INSTEAD OF YOU DIRECTLY THEY WHAT CAN WE DO AND YOU'RE NOT GIVING US A DIRECT ANSWERS TO WHAT WE CAN DO TO MOVE THIS ALONG. IT QUITE FRANKLY I'M GETTING FRUSTRATED JUST. KIND OF WEIRD SITTING URGES. HAVING CONVERSATION INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY ANY KIND OF RESULTS I KNOW IT'S AN OVERSIGHT HEARING BY. I'VE GOTTEN FROM THE FEW MINUTES I'VE BEEN HERE DOT WERE BEHIND IN THE PROJECT THERE IS NO CLEAR ANSWER AS TO WHAT'S GOING TO GET US BACK ON TRACK. AND I THINK THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE. ARE THE REASON FOR THE DIE HEARING IS BECAUSE THEY ARE. OBVIOUSLY THERE'S THERE'S A PROBLEMS AND WE'RE NOT HEARING WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP THIS PROCESS ALONG. A. SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THERE'S NO CLEAR PROCESS TO GET SPECIAL. THERE IS A CLEAR PROCESS TO GET US BACK ON TRACK. WELL REQUIRED BY THE STIPULATED WATER OR. TO PUT TOGETHER A PLAN TO GET US BACK ON TRACK. AND THAT WOULD SPECIFICALLY OUTLINED PROJECTS. FROM A SPECIFIC POINT OF VIEW. WE'LL HAVE CONSTRUCTION STARTED. AND SPECIES CONSERVATION HABITAT BY THE END OF THE YEAR. THAT SAID DESIGN BID BUILD PROJECT. IT TAKES A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME. TO POUND THE DESIGN STUFF. BUT IT TAKES A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME TO COMPLETE THESE BONDS. AND THEN TAKE IT OUT FOR. GET CONTRACTS OR. THE PROJECT AND THE EAST SIDE OF THE RIVER. OUR THERE'S A PACKET THERE SHOULD BE A HAND ON HER PACKET. WITH THE SCHEDULE. AND THOSE THEIR NEXT AND WILL BE MOVING FORWARD. A LOT ALONG WITH. THE SPECIES CONSERVATION AREAS. AREAS TO THE NORTH WHICH WE JUST STARTED WORKING ON. WITH THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY IN PROBABLY A MONTH AGO. WILL BE DESIGNED OVER THE NEXT THREE MONTHS. AND. WE WILL BE ABLE TO WE HAVE TO FINALIZE SOME HYDROLOGY. WITH THEN WE WOULD BE ABLE TO SCHEDULE A TIME FRAME ON THOSE. NOTED THAT PROJECT JUST CAME UP. SO WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN TOO FAR ALONG AND THAT BUT THAT'S THE NEXT. THAT'S THE NEXT PRIORITY. I I DID OUTLINE A FEW THINGS THAT THE. LEGISLATURE CAN DO QUITE FRANKLY. A LOT OF WHAT THE. HOW WERE THE DELAYS ARE I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S OF? IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND THESE ARE THE LASER. BECAUSE BY REVIEW PERIODS OR. SOME KIND OF. OF NEGOTIATION OF WHO WOULD I CAME TO THE. LEGISLATURE SIX MONTHS AGO WITH THE. CONTAMINATION ISSUE WE MIGHT BE FURTHER ALONG WE DIDN'T THAT WAS MY HAIR. WE SHOULD. ARM BUT I DON'T I DON'T THINK. BEYOND WHAT I LISTENED ALREADY THERE'S A SPLIT THERE'S A SPECIFIC THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO. CERTAIN BUT MY CONCERN IS. AGAIN JUST IN THOUGH IN THAT CONVERSATION EARLIER YOU STATED THAT. THOUGH THAT THIS IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US HAVE THESE OVERSIGHT HEARINGS SO WE CAN BACK GET BACK ON TRACK THAT'S WHAT THREW ME OFF OF THE CONVERSATION IS. YEAH WELL SO WHAT I'M HEARING IS IF WE DON'T HAVE THE OVERSIGHT OP MEETINGS THAT WE WOULDN'T BE ON TRACK AND THAT'S WHAT MY CONCERN IS. USE THAT YOU SAID ABOUT TWO OR THREE TIMES AND THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE THESE HEARINGS. AND SO THAT'S CONCERNING TO ME BECAUSE I IT BASICALLY MEANS TO ME THAT IF WE DON'T KEEP YOU ABA KEEP BRINGING YOU BACK THAT THAT THIS IS NOT. YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT GOING TO OUR CONTINUE THE PROJECT AND THAT'S WHAT TO ME OFF. TO BE HONEST WITH YOU IS THAT IF WE DON'T KEEP HAVING THESE HEARINGS WERE NOT GONNA BE ON TRACK WHILE I'M EXPECTING BAD. WEATHER WE HAVE THE HEARINGS ARE NOT THAT WE SHOULD BE ON TRACK BECAUSE THAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF THE THE PROJECT ITSELF. I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT WHEN I UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY AND AND. MY FRUSTRATION LEVEL IS AS HIGH AS YOURS QUITE FRANKLY. IT HAS TAKEN OZONE AQUARIA LONG TIME TO GET HERE. THE REFERENCE TO THE MEETINGS OR I THINK IT HELPS US. FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. WE CAN'T REACH OUT TO EVERYONE. THIS IS JUST ANOTHER WAY WE CAN REACH OUT TO PEOPLE AND INFORM THEM WHAT'S GOING ON. LOOK AT WHAT BUT WHY CAN'T WE REACH OUT TO EVERYONE. WELL WE DON'T HAVE THE. TIME OR THE RESOURCES TO REACH OUT TO EVERYONE SO IF YOU CATCH. SOME PEOPLE. I AM PUBLIC OUTREACH MEETINGS. AND YOU CATCH SOME PEOPLE AND SOCIAL MEDIA. AND YOU CATCH SOME PEOPLE HERE AS JUST ANOTHER METHOD OF COMMUNICATION. I THINK THAT THAT LEADS TO A A GOOD POINT AND A GOOD QUESTION IN TERMS OF THE APPROPRIATE THAT LEVEL OF STAFFING THAT THAT PERHAPS IS AVAILABLE. TO YOU BRUCE AND THAT TO THE REST OF THE TEAM. I'M. YOU MAY NOT SAY THIS BUT I THINK THE PERHAPS. TAKE AWAY HERE IS THAT YOU MAY NOT HAVE. THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE. TO DO THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE YEAR WHICH IS PART OF. WHAT'S DELAYED AT THIS CONVERSATION WHICH HAS ALSO LED TO A CONVERSATION. OF SETTING UP A STRUCTURE WHETHER BE A FORMAL GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE OR AND. A TASK FORCE THAT GOING TO HELP STREAMLINE SOME OF THESE CONVERSATIONS AND MAKE SURE THAT IF IT'S. OUT REACH STAFF THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE PUT IN PLACE SO BE IT TO IN ORDER TO GET THE MESSAGE OUT. WE GOT BACK TO MY POINT THOUGH IF THAT'S THAT IF THAT'S THE REASON DIDN'T BUT THAT SHOULD BE SAID INSTEAD OF APPLIED. I'M A YOU KNOW IF WE CAN SAY I DON'T HAVE PROPER STAFFING INSTEAD OF GOING ABOUT YOU KNOW SAYING YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE THE PROPER RESOURCES. INSTEAD OF ASKING US FOR THOSE RESOURCES I THINK THAT'S WHAT I'M EXPECTING IS WHAT DO YOU NEED. AND AYE WHEN I MADE THE GUY I ASKED QUESTION YOU SAID WE DON'T HAVE YOU KNOW THE PROPER OUTREACH WELL THAT WASN'T INDICATED. EARLIER IF YOU DON'T SAY IT THEN I'M GONNA SOME THAT YOU DO. AND SO THAT'S ITEM MY INTENT FOR BEING HERE IS THAT I WOULD HEAR WHAT WE CAN DO. AND AND MAYBE WE CANNOT FIX SAID LEGISLATIVELY BUT IF YOU NEED MORE STAFF AND THAT'S SHOULD IT SHOULD OF BEEN SAID. AND THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET FROM HERE BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY LIKE I SAID I'M NOT GIVING. YOU KNOW WE'RE JUST HAVING A CONVERSATION INSTEAD OF ADDED SOME KIND WHEN ACTION PLAN OR SOME KIND OF AN* WE WE CAN HELP YOU ALONG. SO THEY'VE RIGHT NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FACE WANTING YOUR MANAGEMENT PLAN BUT I WANT TO SPEND SOME TIME ON SPEAKING ABOUT THE PLAN. TO GET BACK ON TRACK WITH THE PLAN. IN SO WHEN CAN WE EXPECT. THAT TO BE PRESENTED TO US ADAM. WHAT'S THE TIMEFRAME ON THAT. SO THEN THAT'S THAT THE PLAN O GET BACK ON TRACK WITH THE PLAN. WELL WE PLAN TO OUR. WE'LL HAVE THAT BY THE END OF JUNE OKAY. OKAY SO SO WOULDN'T YOU KNOW WE'LL BE GETTING BACK TOGETHER PERHAPS AFTER JUNE BUT I THINK IT'S THAT'S GOING TO BE. EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BECAUSE. I'M HOPING THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE VISION THAT I HAVE AND I THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE IN THE. SOLVENCY AREAS. HAD THAT LIVE IN THAT AREA. ARE ARE ENVISIONING THAT THE STATE AT SOME POINT IF IN FACT BY THE END OF THE YEAR. THERE'S CLOSE TO FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS COMMITTED TO THIS FIRST PHASE. THAT DIE IN ESSENCE WOULD BE FULLY FUNDED THAT THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY OF SEEN PROJECTS UNDER CONSTRUCTION. IN THE NORTH SOUTHEAST WEST OF THE CITY RIGHT THAT THERE WILL BE MULTIPLE PROJECTS BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE SENDING A. VERY POSITIVE OUTLOOK ON THAT AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME OF. WERE JUST NOT. READY TO START ONE PROJECT AND SO IT YOU KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I WANTED HIM. IN SHARE WITH YOU THAT UP PEOPLE. ENVISIONED HAPPENING OUT THERE AT SOME POINT WE HAVE A PLAN WITH MONEY. THAT THERE BE NO REASON WHY PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU'VE GOT THE THE TOOLS AND THE SHY OF MAY BE THE FULL RESOURCES TO DO THE OUTREACH. TO BE ABLE TO GET THESE PROJECTS UNDER CONSTRUCTION ABOVE. WE NEED TO. ANTICIPATE. MORE THAN ONE KIND OF PROJECTS UNDER CONSTRUCTION AT THE SAME TIME. THE NORTH IN PROJECT IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE LITTLE BE UNDER CONSTRUCTION. ANY OTHER SPECIES CONSERVATION HABITAT. OR THE AREA TO THE RIGHT WEST OF THE RIVER I DON'T KNOW WHICH. SPECIES CONSERVATION HAVE A CAT HAS CONSTRUCTED FIRST IF WE GOT THAT DONE READ MOVE TO THE WEST OF THE RIVER. CITING REPRESSED WE ANTICIPATE HAVING TO. MAYBE THREE OF ITS CERTAINLY TWO PROJECTS GOING ON AT THE SAME TIME. AND. WHEN WE GET THERE OR AS WE GET CLOSE TO THEIR ANOTHER PROJECT MANAGER OR TO. HOA OR ENGINEER WOULD BE SOMETHING WE WOULD BE LOOKING FOR THAT'S IN NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET. YEAH BUT YOU'RE. AUSTIN'S ARE PERTINENT AND RIGHT ON POINT FOR THE DEPARTMENT WE DO HAVE. STAFFING ISSUES. WE COULD USE ADDITIONAL STAFF AUTHORITY TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY. DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT ACTIONS. ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY TO MEET AND GET BACK ON TRACK AS YOU'RE POINTING OUT MAYBE I DIDN'T DO A GOOD ENOUGH JOB OF CLARIFYING THAT WE HAVE MULTIPLE PROJECTS UNDER DESIGN RIGHT NOW AND. WE EXPECT THEM TO BE THE NEXT STEPS AND HOME AND IN CONSTRUCTION NOW THEY'RE THEY'RE. GOING TO BE SOME OFFSET IN TIME JUST BECAUSE OF THE DESIGN PROCESS THAT GOES ON AND THEN THE CONTRACTING PROCESS THAT WILL GO ON BUT. WE ARE ON TRACK IN THE. HAND OUT. HERE BUT THE ONE THAT SHOWED A LITTLE MORE DETAIL IN THE RIVER WEST AREA. THE DESIGN BUILD PROCESS WILL LET US MOVE TO THE WEST OF NEW RIVER AND. ACTUALLY GET A PROJECT IMPLEMENTED. AS QUICKLY AS ANYTHING ONCE WE GET THE EASEMENT. AGREEMENT SETTLED. VAN THE. ALCOTT ROAD PROJECT IS THE OTHER PROJECT THAT WILL GET US TOWARDS AT LEAST THAT FIVE HUNDRED ACRES AND SO BETWEEN THOSE TWO. NEW RIVER WEST AND THE ALCOTT PROJECT. WE WILL BE. ON TRACK WITH THOSE PROJECTS TO START MEETING THOSE STIPULATED ORDER. ACREAGES BUT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK AND I AM BECAUSE OF THOSE ANNUAL TARGETS IT STACKS UP VERY FAST ON THE DEPARTMENT. HOA THE CONTRACTING PROCESS DOESN'T GO BACK QUICKLY TO GET SOMETHING DESIGNED AND OUT THE CONTRACT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE HAVE THAT QUESTION HERE FROM WHAT I JUST HEARD. THAT I CAN APPRECIATE THAT YOU SAY THAT TO OTHERS LOT OF WORK BUT THEN WE KNOW THIS IN THE BEGINNING. WELL THE STIPULATED ORDER WAS A NEW THING THAT WAS. MAY KNOW THAT THE OF THE PLANNING PROCESS WE UNDERSTAND FROM A DEPARTMENT. BOB PERSPECTIVE OF. USUALLY IT TAKES YOU KNOW A YEAR MAYBE UP TO TWO YEARS TO DO DESIGN. AND THEN YOU GIVE YOURSELF SOMEWHERE OUT NINE TO TWELVE MONTH PERIOD TO GET TO A CONTRACT AND THEN YOU WORK THROUGH THE CONSTRUCTION OF. A TWO OF THREE A FIVE YEAR DEPEND UPON THIS SUNDAY ON SCIENCE THE PROJECT LET ME ADD OTHER HOUSEHOLDER THAT OUR. PETS THE REASON FOR THE DESIGN BILL. WE CAN GET THAT UNDER CONTRACT. MUCH FASTER. AND WE CAN ACTUALLY BE CONSTRUCTING. PART OF THE PROJECT OUR DESIGNING THE OTHER PART OF THE PROJECT. SAU WAS THE IDEA BEHIND A SIGN DON'T. TRY TO SPEED THAT PROCESS UP. BECAUSE THERE'S AN EXAMPLE I THINK. OF A PROCESS THAT IS. BEEN COMPRESSED AS MUCH AS WE CAN COMPRESS IT IT JUST TAKES THAT LONG TO GET THROUGH THAT PROCESS. WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT WAYS. THE WAY MY COMPRESSORS AND MATT HAS BEEN ON BOARD FOR WHAT THREE WEEKS OR SO. HARD TO COORDINATE THAT AND SEE IF THERE ARE WAYS TO COMPRESS IT EVEN FURTHER. BUT AFTER THAT AFTER A CERTAIN POINT. THERE JUST ISN'T ANY MORE SWEET ZERO I MEAN YOU CAN'T. YOU CAN COMPRESS THAT BEYOND YOU HAVE TO HAVE CERTAIN. HAVE TO HAVE CERTAIN HARM. TIME FRAMES FOR THE. FOR THEY ADVERTISEMENT AND THINGS LIKE THAT ASSISTING AND THAT'S JUST A GIVEN CONCERT CHARDON MATT GOOD HARTMAN OF OUR WATER RESOURCES AND WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF THE HEARINGS AS RELATES TO THE OROVILLE. DAM PROJECT. AND CLEARLY AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT FOR CALIFORNIA IT'S WATER RELIANCE. AND SUPPLY YOU KNOW FOR THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. AND WE'VE UP REACTED. IN A VERY EXPEDITIOUS AND IN A RESPONSIVE MANNER TO ADDRESSING THE ISSUEAYE I'M WONDERING. HOW DO WE COMPARE AS IT RELATES TO THE LEVEL OF? TIME ENERGY AND RESOURCES I WHEN WE TALKING ABOUT CAPACITY WHETHER BE OUT REACH. STAFF OR FOR THAT MATTER BEING ABLE TO MOVE THE DESIGN BUILD PROCESS. ACCORDING TO THE SCHEDULES WHAT WHERE WHERE DO WE WHERE DO WE FALL WITHIN YOU KNOW THE CONTEXT OF THE. NOT SO MUCH RANKING THE LEVEL OF IMPORTANCE BECAUSE I WOULD SAY THAT THEY'RE BOTH EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW THE PRESSURES HERE A BIT DIFFERENT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PUBLIC CAL ECOSYSTEM DILAPIDATION. ARE GOING ON WE HAVE A PLAN WE'VE GOT SOME MONEY WHAT WHERE DO WE WHERE WE SEE OURSELVES IN COMPARISON TO. HOW WE'RE RESPONDING TO OUR THE CRISIS IN THE SALTON SEA VERSES THE OROVILLE DAM ARE STARTING TED ME HAVE SOME COMMENTS ON WERE ABILITY WAS INVOLVED IN OUR EMAIL? I THINK WE ARE SLOWER THAN OROVILLE. AND WE COULD LOOK AT WHY WE COULD LOOK AT. THAT TO SEE IF THERE WAS. AND EMERGENCY DECLARED OR WHAT PROCESS WAS USED. AT OROVILLE THAT COULD SPEED THINGS UP BECAUSE CERTAINLY. THAT WAS AN EXPEDITED SCHEDULE. SO WE WILL LOOK INTO THAT. IT IS THERE IS THERE. AN EMERGENCY THAT NEEDS TO BE DECLARED. AS RELEASES ON BECAUSE I THINK I MEAN LOCALLY WE I THINK LOCALLY WE'VE DECLARED IT AS. A A STATE OF EMERGENCY IS STATE OF OUR PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT. OF ECONOMIC THREAT OUGHT TO THE REGION I MEAN IS THERE A SOMETHING OF THAT SORT OF ACTION THAT WE NEED TO TAKE AS A LEGISLATURE OR IS THAT SIMPLY. UPON THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO MAKE THAT CALL I DON'T KNOW WHOLE RESEARCH AND FIND OUT. I THINK THE GOVERNOR HAS TO MAKE THE CALL. IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE GOVERNOR WE CAN MAKE THE CALL BUT IF YOU'RE SAYING THAT THAT'S WHAT'S REQUIRED THEN ASK US TO ASK THE GOVERNOR TO MAKE THAT CALL OWNERS WE CAN. I MEAN THAT IT WHAT I'M HEARING IS IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES THEN I THINK. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA AND I WE ARE WILLING TO. ASKED THE GOVERNOR TO DO THAT BUT THAT'S THE POINT THAT'S I'M GOING BACK TO WHAT I SAID ORIGINALLY IF YOU DON'T TELL US WHAT WE CAN DO THAT WE CAN EXPEDITE ANYTHING IF IF THAT'S WHAT THE REQUIRED MEANT AS. WELL AS THE GOVERNOR I I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A REQUIREMENT WE'RE GONNA LOOK INTO IT COULD IT COULD HELP SO WE'LL LOOK INTO IT AND SAY. THANK YOU I GOT TO ONE QUESTION ONE FINAL QUESTION WE HAVE ANOTHER PANEL AWAITING. YOU KNOW THE WATER POUR REQUIRES ANYA REPORTING UNDER THE PHASE WANTING YOUR PLAN. DO MULTIPLE DEPARTMENT PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THE WATER BOARD TO THE REPORT TO YOU. I THIS REPORTING CHO NOT POINTS ON C. PROJECTS THAT ARE NOT IN THE TEN YEAR PLAN OTHER WORDS WHAT. ARE WE KIND OF TRYING TO KEEP EACH OTHER AND. ARE ALL OF US. TO THE SCHEDULE AND ACCOUNTABLE TO. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE? HARLAN. WE WERE IRATE TO REPORT NATURAL RESOURCES RIGHTS REPORT. US ARUM. FISH AND WILDLIFE AND DWI WILL PROVIDE US INFORMATION. I AS MY TIME MAY OTHERS US FISH WILDLIFE ANOTHER IS THE IDEA IS TO TRY TO GIVE A PICTURE. SNAPSHOT PICTURE WHERE WERE ADDED CONSULTANCY. SO ANY OF THOSE AGENCIES ARE OTHERS OF. REGIONAL BOARD. COULD WEIGH EN. HARM. SECOND HALF YEAR QUESTION LAWS SO I MEAN THERE'S THERE ARE PROJECTS THAT ARE NOT IN THE PLAN. AND HOW ARE WE. KEEPING TABS OF THOSE PROJECTS IN MAKING SURE THAT WERE. ON SCHEDULE IRRESPECTIVE OF. THEM BEING DIRECTED OVERSEEN BY YOU BUT TIED TO THE MITIGATION EFFORTS ALLEN THE SOLVENCY. WELL WE WILL HAVE A SECTION IN THERE. ABOUT LONG RANGE PLANNING. AND WHERE WE STAND ON. WATER QUALITY IMPROVEMENT. ARE WHERE WE STAND ON OUR. WATER IMPORTANT THINGS LIKE THAT AND TRACK THOSE SORT OF PROJECTS. LOVE SO START TO TRACK ALTHOUGH WE HAVEN'T DEVELOPED. THE PLAN FOR THAT YET BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T GOT TO A POINT WHERE. HANYA WE'VE BEEN CONCENTRATING ON THE TEN YEAR PLAN. WHENEVER WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE WATER EMPLOYER BEFORE WE GO MUCH FURTHER. AND THE LONG RANGE PLAN THE WORLD. WILL TRY TO IDENTIFY AS MANY OF THOSE PROJECTS AS WE POSSIBLY CAN. MY MY GUT FEEL IS THAT IT'S GONNA BE. A SERIES OF PROJECTS MUCH LIKE WHAT WE HAVE NOW. TO. KEEP THE. A SMALLER BUT SUSTAINABLE SOLVENCY. OR IT'S GONNA BE A WATER IMPORTANT PROJECT. WHICH ARE VERY EXPENSIVE AND TAKES A LONG PERIOD OF TIME BUT CERTAINLY FIXES THE WATER ELEVATION. GENTLEMAN. MY LAST QUESTION AND THEN I'LL LET MY COLLEAGUE ALSO MAYBE ASK QUESTIONS SHE STILL DOES IS THE CURRENT WAY WE'RE DOING THINGS WORKING. I MEAN IS IT WORKING I THINK IT IS THAT YOU KNOW I THINK FROM WHERE WE WERE. TWO YEARS AGO TILL NOW. DOESN'T SHOW IT ON THE GROUND BUT I THINK WE HAVE. MADE SOME GREAT STRIDES INTERNALLY AND GETTING PLANNING DONE. INTERNALLY AND GETTING. THE CONSTRUCT OF THE CONTRACTING PROCESS CORD AROUND HIS SEMI SAN. AND SO I THINK WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS. WE ARE. CLOSE AS YOU HEARD EARLIER TO PUTTING STUFF ON THE GROUND. AND ONCE WE GET STARTED PUTTING STUFF ON THE GROUND THAT WILL GO MUCH QUICKER. SO YES I THINK IT'S WORKING COULDN'T STAND IMPROVEMENT IT SURE COULD. PERHAPS A THAT THE NEXT JOB I CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT IMPROVEMENT. HAVE BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S PART OF WHAT I'M HOPING WE CAN WALK AWAY WITH IN TERMS OF WHAT ARE THE THAT EFFICIENCIES THAT WE CAN. PUT IN PLACE ARE CONSIDERING OF THE LONGEVITY OF THE DISCUSSIONS WE'VE BEEN HAVING TO TRY TO GET ONE PROJECT UP THE GROUND. SURE. BICU A FEW TIMES I'VE HEARD. YOU KNOW THE PROCESS IS THE PROCESS THAT WHO CREATES THE PROCESS. I'D THE BOW CONTRACTING PROFITS WHO CREATES ALL OF THESE PROCESSES IF WE HAVE IF WE CREATE THEM THAT WE CAN'T COMPLAIN ABOUT THEM. BEING SO LONG AND ARDUOUS. AND SO IF YOU HAVE ANY ANY SAY SO IN THE PROCESS THEN IF WE CREATED THAT WE CAN COMPLAIN ABOUT HOW HARD IT IS. THEN WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS. STREAMLINED THAT PROCESS AND THAT'S THE FRUSTRATION I HEAR THAT THIS IS THE FIFTH SIXTH TIME THAT I HEAR ALL THE PROCESS THE PROCESS BUT WE CREATE THE PROCESS. SO IF WE CREATE PROCESS WE CAN'T MISS ARE THE COMPLAIN ABOUT HOW HARD IT IS BECAUSE WE'RE CREATING IT AND IF WE DO CREATE PROCESS THAN. HOW ABOUT WE WORK ON STREAMLINING THE PROCESS SO THAT WE DON'T WE'RE NOT SITTING HERE? YOU KNOW GOING ROUND AND ROUND ABOUT HOW HARD PROCESSES. WELL I THINK THAT ONE OF MATT'S NUMBER ONE GOALS. HIS TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS THAT'S WHY HE'S FAIRLY NEW IN THAT POSITION. LESS THAN A MONTH. AND. HELLO ALREADY WERE SAYING SOUND RESULTS BUT HE'S GONNA SEE HOW MUCH OF THAT. HIS CHEST INTERNAL PROCESS THAT CAN BE CLEARED OUT OF THE WAY SOME OF IT ISN'T PUT THEM. THEIR MERRY LA MAY BE PARTS OF IT THAT WE CAN SAY. WE DON'T NEED TO DO THAT FOR THESE PROJECTS AND CUT THAT TIME FRAME ALL. THERE IS CONSTRUCTION AUTHORITY AND CONSTRUCTION RULES BUT THE STATE HAS ESTABLISHED FOR GOING OUT THE CONTRACT. AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT. IT IS WITHIN THE CONTROL TO MODIFY OF THE LEGISLATURE. WE FOLLOW PROCESSES THAT ARE OUTLINED IN STATE. RULES AND REGULATIONS AUTHORITIES FOR CONTRACTING UP CONSTRUCTION SO. IS THEY'RE EFFICIENCIES THAT COULD BE. CREATED THEIR TO SHORTENED TIME FRAMES FORCE SOMETHING MAYBE. ARM. FOR THE DEPARTMENT THE DESIGN BUILD PROCESS IS BRAND NEW. THERE IS A STEEP LEARNING CURVE FOR OUR DEPARTMENT TO FIGURE THAT OUT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S NOT JUST A CONGRADULATIONS HERE GO DO THIS. WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT PROCESS LOOKS LIKE WE ARE MAKING GOOD STRIDES IN THAT. AND I THINK ONCE WE ESTABLISH WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL FACILITATE. MOVING CONSTRUCTION FORWARD MUCH MORE QUICKLY THAN AS A QUESTION ON THAT WE WE HAVE SOME PARTNERS. THAT THAT ARE PART OF THIS CONVERSATION THAT KNOW HOW TO DO THE DESIGN BUILD ALREADY RIGHT AND SO WHAT'S IN THE WAY OF ALLOWING ONE OF THOSE PARTNERS TO ACTUALLY TAKE THE LEAD ON THAT PARTICULAR PART OF. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE CONSTRUCTION AUTHORITY WR IS THE CONSTRUCTION AUTHORITY OKAY OR THE STATE PALM? AND IT'S BRAND NEW AUTHORITY FOR US AND WE'RE USING AND LEVERAGING CALTRANS. WHO HAS THAT AUTHORITY ALREADY NOW SPECIFICALLY DID UP BR WAS ONLY GIVEN THAT AUTHORITY FOR CONSTRUCTION AT THE SALTON SEA? SO WE DIDN'T HAVE ANYWHERE ELSE NAM AND IN TERMS OF HOW QUICKLY WE CAN GET THAT AND PLAY THAT'S WHAT BRUCE IS REFERRING TO AND. OUR INTERNAL PROCESSES FOR NEW. TEACHING LEARNING ARE. AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN INSIDE OF OUR DEPARTMENT. UPSTART DIVISION OF ENGINEERING IS. DEDICATED TO TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT. OF THEM. CAN THERE BE EXTRA EMPHASIS PLACED ON IT I THINK THAT WOULD BE. WHO FAIR ENOUGH FOR THE LEGISLATION A LEGISLATOR HERE TO? HOUSE THE DEPARTMENT. WHAT IS IT THAT WE CAN DO TO FACILITATE MOVING THESE THINGS FORWARD? COM ADDITIONAL STAFF CERTAINLY. WOULD ASSIST AS YOU IDENTIFIED OR A BILL IS A BIG BURDEN THERE'S PLENTY OF OTHER PROJECTS THAT OUR DIVISION ENGINEERING IS ALSO COMMITTED TO. SO THEY'RE BEING STRETCHED IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH. OF FOCUS AND PEOPLE THEY CAN THROW AT IT. AS WELL AS OURS AGAIN THE DESIGN BUILD IS GONNA BE A A A WAY THAT WE CAN LEVERAGE. CONSULTING FIRMS AND DESIGN FIRMS SO THAT IT'S NOT JUST STATE STAFF TRYING TO DO ALL THE DESIGN WORK AND AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO. HOMICIDE DO THINK THAT WILL YOU'LL SEE. US BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD. MUCH QUICKER WHEN WE GET THAT. OVER THAT LEARNING CURVE AND AND FIGURE OUT WHAT IT TAKES TO ESTABLISH THAT AND THEN LET ME ADD THAT I DON'T THINK AT LEAST RIGHT NOW. THAT STAFF IS THE PROBLEM AND. AND LEARNING THE. AND DEVELOPING THE DESIGN BILL THAT'S TRUE THAT'S THAT'S OUR EXISTING STAFF LEARNING AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE THIS PROCESS DESIGN BUILD PROCESS BUILT INTO THAT APARTMENT. SO THAT'S NOT AN ADDITIONAL STAFF WHEN WE GET THE CONSTRUCTION AND DESIGN AND OVERSIGHT. THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GONNA NEED ADDITIONAL PEOPLE TO HELP OVERSEE MULTIPLE CONTRACTORS AND MAKE THAT MAKE SURE THOSE PROCESSES. AND THE CONSTRUCTION HAPPENS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. WE GET THERE. RIGHT SCOTT LIKE TO CLOSE WITH I THINK I KNOW YOU'RE LEAVING BUT THE. OTHERS. YEAH I GUESS SO TO SAY. WHO WE'RE PREPARED TO IMPLEMENT THE FISH WILDLIFE MEASURES ONCE PROJECTS GET BUILT WE WE WANT THE FIRST ONE TO GET DONE IT'S IT'S THE PROOF OF CONCEPT FOR HOW WE LOOK AT ALL OF THE OTHER PROJECTS THAT WE'VE GIVEN? OUR DESIGN INPUT INTO ALL OF THAT. I THINK AS WE'VE DISCUSSED TODAY YOU POINTED OUT WE JUST NEED TO GET THE EASEMENT DOWN. WE NEED TO GET. THE CONTRACTING DOWN AND BUILD THE PROJECT. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ALL WORKING ON. RIGHT. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME I APPRECIATE THE. CONVERSATION THAT WE'VE JUST HAD I THINK THERE'S SOME EXPECTATIONS THAT YOU'VE ALSO PUT FORWARD. IN TERMS OF. MEETING SOME BENCHMARKS. AND TOUGH FOR US IT SOUNDS LIKE WE'VE GOT A COUPLE THINGS TO TAKE A LOOK AT AS WELL TO SEE HOW WE CAN CONTINUE TO REINFORCE. AND SUPPORT YOUR EFFORTS. I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THIS PROJECT THAT AS MANY OF THE PROJECTS THAT WE UNDERTAKE THAT WHETHER BE IT THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH WILDLIFE FOR. APARTMENT WATER RESOURCES IS BEING. LOOKED AT. IN THE SAME LEVEL OF PRIORITIES. THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT YOU KNOW PROJECTS LIKE THE OROVILLE DAM PROJECT THAT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. TO THE WATER SYSTEM OF CALIFORNIA. ARE AND AS WAS HIGHLIGHTED AT THE INTRODUCTION THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. ARE NOT JUST DO IT REGION'S QUALITY OF LIFE I AND OR THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF FOLKS BUT TO THE ECOSYSTEM. FOR THE ENTIRE STATE AND SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR. ALL YOUR TIME IN WILL CALL UP THE THIRD PANEL THROUGH REAL QUICKLY WHAT WE CAN DO IS OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT. BY THE END OF MAY. PUT TOGETHER WHAT WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE COULD DO TO HELP US NOW. HA AND I'M. AND WE CAN MEET WITH YOU GUYS YES WE CERTAINLY WE CERTAINLY WILL BE MEETING AND THAT WE WILL HAVE OUR TEAM HERE. ENGAGE WITH YOU INTIMATELY EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE ARE ON TRACK IRRESPECTIVE OF HAVING A HEARING OR NOT LET ME WE KNOW WHY BRADLEY PART OF THE TEAM. THANK YOU THANKS. WE'LL ASK GOD DAVID DEAD LOW DISTANCE PROFESSOR OF BIO MEDICINE AND SCIENCES FROM THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE MEDICAL SCHOOL. TO PLEASE COME FORWARD. LEASE OR METAL CAN DIRECTOR OF GLOOMY DISCIPLINE BY IT AND PHIL ROSEN TRADER. AT THE CHEN MANAGER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SONGS HERE THORNY. ALONG WITH CITY UP PASSED DIRECTOR BUILDING HEALTHY COMMUNITIES EASTERN COACHELLA VALLEY. WE'LL LET TAKE A TESTIMONY IN THAT SAME ORDER. A WELCOME EVERYONE. COOL. ALRIGHT YOU'VE GOT YOU'VE ALL GOT ABOUT. THREE TO FOUR MINUTES OF TESTIMONY AND. WE CERTAINLY HAVE SOME QUESTIONS AS WELL FOR YOU ALL IN AND PERHAPS THE. IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CONVERSATION WE JUST HAD. HOPING THAT WE COULDN'T ENTER INTO DIALOGUE AYE WITH EACH ONE OF YOU THERE'S WELL SO WELCOME DOCTOR IN KNOW YOU MAY PROCEED OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN GARCIA. ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. ALSO WANT TO THANK THE LEGISLATURE FOR THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE CALIFORNIA'S NEWEST SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. I'M DAVID LOW I MEAN THE THING IS PROFESSOR OF BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES AND SEE YOURSELF FITTING OF RESEARCH FOR THE UC RIVERSIDE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. I'M ALSO DIRECTOR OF THE BRIEF CENTER AT YOU SEE OUR. BRIEF STANDS FOR BRIDGING REGIONAL ECOLOGY ARIS LIGHT TOXINS AND HEALTH EFFECTS WITCHES. IN BRIEF A CENTER DEVOTED TO STUDYING AIR QUALITY AND HEALTH EFFECTS. THE MULTI DISCIPLINARY CENTER THAT BRINGS TOGETHER RESEARCHERS IN ECOLOGY ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY CLIMATE MODELING. AS AND FINALLY TOM HEALTH EFFECTS. SO TODAY I'LL BE DISCUSSING EFFECTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES MAINLY THE ONGOING AND POTENTIAL FUTURE IMPACT OF THE SALTON SEA ON THE POOR AIR QUALITY. AND ITS EFFECTS ON HEALTH IN THE REGION. SALTON SEA IS ALREADY. KNOWN TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON HEALTH THE COACHELLA VALLEY. ON HEALTH ASSESSMENT SURVEYS HAVE FOUND THAT IN THE REGION AROUND THE SALTON SEA ASTHMA RATES ARE CONSIDERABLY HIGHER THAN SOMEPLACE APPROACHING DOUBLE THE RATE IN CALIFORNIA IN GENERAL. I DON'T HAVE TIME TO DISCUSS THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THESE HEALTH EFFECTS BUT BE ASSURED THAT. CHRONIC ILLNESSES RELATED TO THESE ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON QUALITY OF LIFE AND DAYS OF WORK LOS ILLEGALS CERTAINLY INCREASE IF THE SOUND SEEMED FIREMAN DEGRADES FURTHER. IT SHOULD BE NO SURPRISE THAT LUNG DISEASE THAT STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY THE QUALITY OF THE AIR THAT WE BREATHE. UP WE IN THE MEDICAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNITY HAVE BEEN WELL AWARE OF THE CONNECTION BETWEEN POLLUTION AND HEALTH. INCLUDING LONG AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND GENERAL FACTS ON HOW. BUT IT'S ALSO EVIDENT THAT POLLUTION IS NOT THE ONLY ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE AFFECTING HEALTH. WHAT POLLUTION HAS BEEN STEADILY DECREASING IN AMERICAN CITIES THERE'S A NAGGING STATISTIC THAT ASPIRATE CONTINUE TO INCREASE? SUGGESTING THAT WE HAVEN'T COMPLETELY IDENTIFY ALL THE RELEVANT FACTORS AFFECTING PULMONARY AND CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH. SO ONE DEVELOPMENT AREA OF STUDY IS THE HEALTH EFFECTS OF PARTICULATE MATTER IN THE AIR. AND IT'S IMPACT ON HEALTH. ONE MAJOR INDICATOR OF OF VERY SMALL AEROSOL PARTICULATES IS CALLED PM TEN. WHICH IS THE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL THE AIR LESS THAN TEN MICRONS IN SIZE. SO FOR REFERENCE OF TEN MICRONS IS LESS THAN A TENTH OF THE AVERAGE HUMAN HERE. IN AND. WITH AND LESS THAN HALF THE SIZE OF TYPICAL POLLEN GRAINS. THE PARTICLE SIZES MOST RELEVANT BECAUSE HE'S EXTREMELY SMALL PARTICLES ARE ABLE PENETRATE DEEP INTO THE LUNG TISSUE. AND TRIGGER INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES. STUDIES THAT PREVIOUSLY SHOWN THAT IN THE COACHELLA VALLEY A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN AVERAGE NUMBER OF DEATHS OR EXCESS DEATHS. FROM PULMONARY OR CARDIOVASCULAR CAUSES HAVE OCCURRED IN THE FOUR DAYS FOLLOWING DUST STORM WITH HIGH LEVELS OF PM TEN. THESE WOULD BE CONSIDERED ACUTE EFFECTS BUT IS AFFECTED OCCUR QUITE SOON AFTER EXPOSURE IN CONTRAST TO CHRONIC EFFECTS WHICH TAKE YEARS TO DEVELOP. THESE ACUTE EFFECTS ONLY BEGIN TO POINT OUT THE EFFECTS OF LOW DOSE CHRONIC EXPOSURES ON CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASES INCLUDING ASTHMA AND COPD. SO IT'S ALREADY EVIDENT THAT AEROSOL PARTICULAR THROUGH ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED HEALTH RISKS. NOTE ALSO THAT CHRONIC DISEASES SUCH AS ASTHMA DO NOT HAVE SIMPLE CURES. THESE ARE CHRONIC DISEASES THAT GET PROGRESSIVELY WORSE OVER TIME. SO THERE MEDICAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS STAYS WITH US IN THE LONG TERM. IN THE STUDIES OF COACHELLA VALLEY DUST TO DUST STORMS THAT I MENTIONED. SPECIFIC COMPONENTS OF THE DUST CONTRIBUTING TO THE FACTS HAVE NOT YET BEEN ANALYZED. IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SALTON SEA HOWEVER THE COMPONENTS OF THE DUST ARE RELEVANT. AT THE EXPOSED LAKE BED THE AT THE PLAYA TOXIC MATERIALS ARE CONCENTRATED AND EXPOSED. THE TOXIC MATERIALS INCLUDE HEAVY METALS SUCH AS SELENIUM PESTICIDES SUCH AS DDT FROM AGRICULTURAL RUNOFF. AND OTHER TOXIC ORGANIC COMPOUNDS PRODUCED IN THE WATER. SOILS IN THE REGION ALSO CONTAIN BACTERIA AND FUNGI THAT A PART OF THE ENVIRONMENTALLY COLLEGE YOU THE REGION. YOU NO DOUBT AWARE OF THE IMPACT OF THE SOIL FUNGAL MICRO. TECH STUDIO. EXCIDIO EIGHTIES IN THE. CAUSE OF VALLEY FEVER. WANT WHEN I BEGAN THIS DISCUSSION WITH REFERENCE TO CHRONIC PULMONARY DISEASE SUCH AS ASTHMA AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES AS WELL AS INFECTIOUS DISEASES. I SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT INCREASED AEROSOL PARTICULATES ARE ALSO INSISTED WITH SYSTEMIC DISEASES INCLUDING NARROW DEVELOPMENTAL DISEASES SUCH OUGHT SUCH AS AUTISM. AND NEURO DEGENERATIVE DISEASES SUCH AS ALZHEIMER'S AND PARKINSON'S. THESE EFFECTS SIMPLY POINT TO THE OVERALL GENERAL HEALTH IMPACT OF DEGRADED AIR QUALITY. EVEN WITHOUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT CONTRIBUTIONS FROM VEHICLE EMISSIONS AT. POLLUTANTS. SO HOW MUCH DOES THE DRYING SOLVENCY CONTRIBUTE TO THESE ARIS LIGHT PARTICULATES IN COACHELLA VALLEY. A RECENT STUDY BY ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES WRITE A BAHRAINI AT UC RIVERSIDE. HAS EXAMINED THE THE AEROSOL DUST IN THE VALLEY AND FOUND THAT AS MUCH AS SEVENTY PERCENT OF CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THE DUST ORIGINATE FROM THE EXPOS PLY AT THE SALTON SEA. SO IT'S THE PHONE THING DRIES UP DUE TO REDUCED INPUT FROM AGRICULTURAL RUNOFF THESE PLAYA DUST WILL NOT ONLY COMPRISE A GREATER PROPORTION OF THE AEROSOL PARTICULATE. BUT WILL ALSO INCREASE THE OVERALL CONCENTRATION OF PARTICULATES IN THE VALLEY. THIS NOT ONLY NARAL CONCERN TO THE PEOPLE LIVING RIGHT NEXT TO SALTON SEA. THE EFFECTS OF THE ARE SLICE PARTICLES ALREADY EXTEND WELL ACROSS THE COACHELLA VALLEY. BEYOND THE SHORT SO THE SALTON SEA. PARTICLE TRANSPORTER NELSON BY ANOTHER ON TO MY COLLEAGUES. THAT YOU SEE ARE WILL PORTER SURE THAT PARTICLE TRANSPORT BY SEASONAL WINS. CARRY HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF THE US TO THE SOUTH AND EASTERN THE WINTER AND SPRING MONTHS. BUT DURING THE SUMMER AND FALL MONTHS THE WINDS ALSO CARRY PARTICLES NORTH AND WEST WHERE THE CITIES OF PALM DESERT IN PALM SPRINGS ARE AFFECTED. THE SULFURIC ODORS EMITTED BY THAT YEAR CHEMISTRY OF THE SALTON SEA ARE ALREADY FAMILIAR TO RESIDENTS OF RESIDENTS OF PALM SPRINGS. AND HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO DRIFT AS FAR AS ORANGE AND SAN BERNARDINO COUNTIES WHEN THE WINDS ARE JUST RIGHT. SO IT SHOULD BE NO COMFORT TO KNOW THAT INCREASING LEVELS OF PM TEN PARTICULATES AND THEIR HEALTH IMPACTS ARE ON THEIR WAY AS WELL. SO MANY OF OTHERS HAVE ALREADY FOR TO THE CRISIS OF THE SALTON SEA OR RATHER MULTIPLE CRISES IN TERMS OF INCREASING SALINITY AND EFFECT ON WATER QUALITY AQUATIC LIFE MIGRATORY BIRD POPULATIONS. AS WELL AS IMPACT FUND TURRETS AND AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY. I'M HERE TO POINT TO THE CRISIS AND HEALTH EFFECTS THROUGHOUT THE REGION THAT'S ALREADY IN PROGRESS. AND THE TRENDS POINT TO INCREASINGLY SEVERE EFFECTS IN PULMONARY AND CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH WITH INCREASING IMPACTS AND OTHER CHRONIC DISEASES AS WELL. WHILE THE BRIEF CENTER YOU SEE OUR RESEARCH IS FOCUS ON UNDERSTANDING FROM THE DETAILED MECHANISM. BEHIND THESE HEALTH IMPACTS. UP MUCH OF THE EVIDENCE AND ASSOCIATIONS ARE ALREADY KNOWN AS I MENTIONED. OTHERS ARE ABLE TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE SCALE OF ECONOMIC AND POPULATION AFFECTS. AND MEMBER OF THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY WE HELPED TO PROVIDE A WARNING ON THE SEVERITY OF THE INCREASING HEALTH EFFECTS AND ACCOMPANYING ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL IMPACTS INSOLVENCY. THANKS FOR YOUR TIME AND TOUCH THANK YOU DOCTOR AT THE NEXT UP PRESENTER WILL BE DUDLEY SO MOTHER WITHOUT ME TO SIMPLIFY. THINK OF IT THANK CHAIRMAN. FINANCIALLY SO MELLOW AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF COMMITTEES TO EQUAL BY A WHERE A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION. BUT ARE PRIMARY FOCUS ON ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND PUBLIC HEALTH. THE SALTON SEA PERSIST IN THE BURDENS OF POLLUTION FAILING TO MEET FEDERAL STANDARDS FOR PARTICULATE MATTER. LONG BEFORE THE SALTON SEA BECAME A CBO PM ANTARCTIC'S PROBLEM IN OUR REGION. WITH AS MUCH AT ALL TIME HIGH CARDIOVASCULAR AND RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS IN THE REGION NEED SWIFT. IMPLEMENTATION OF MITIGATION PROJECTS TO STABILIZE THE MISSIVE OF CONDITIONS. OUR BOYS TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. FOR THIS REASON COMEY BESSIE BECAUSE BY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF. WATER RESOURCES LAUNCH THE SALTON SEA COMMUNITY OUTREACH EDUCATION AND ENGAGEMENT PROGRAM WE CALL CHLOE. THE EDUCATION. GET COMMUNITY INVOLVED. ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY IN THE EXISTING CONDITIONS AND PROGRESS OF THE TEN YEAR PLAN. WE HAVE DEVELOPED EDUCATION MATERIALS THAT IS CLEARLY COMPREHENSIBLE TO THE COMMUNITY INTO PREDOMINANT LANGUAGE IS ENGLISH AND SPANISH. EXPLAINING TO THE COMMUNITY AS CLEAR AND SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE GENERAL INFORMATION ON THE SALTON SEA. ITS HISTORY ITS CURRENT CONDITIONS HOW IT AFFECTS WILDLIFE HABITAT PUBLIC HEALTH. AND THE SALTON SEA REPRESENTS WHAT'S TAUGHT AND HE REPRESENTS TO THE COMMUNITY. THE AVERAGE INFORMATION PROVIDED TO THE COMMUNITY INCLUDES AIR MONITORING INFORMATION FOUND THAT I'VE BEEN THERE DOT ORG. CONSISTING OF FORTY LOW COST MONITORS COLOCATED TO AYE A DE REGULATORY MONITORING STATIONS AND DISTRIBUTED. USING REGULATORY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODOLOGIES. THE COMMUNITY AIR MONITORING INFORMATION IS ONE OF THE FIRST TOOLS THAT WE USE TO DEVELOP A COMMUNICATIONS PLAN ON THE HEALTH HAZARDS OF THE SALTON SEA. THE ISLAND AIRPORT ON IS A TOOL THAT CAN BE USED BY INDIVIDUALS TO FIND AIR QUALITY REAL TIME AIR QUALITY IN THE AREAS OF THE SALTON SEA. THREE WEB ORDER THAT OR THAT IT THAT ALSO PROVIDES OUR MERCHANT AND THE COMMUNITY CAN REGISTER AND SIGN UP TO GET THESE ALERTS. WE HAVE INCREASED THE USE OF THE IVAN AIR BY PROMOTING SCHOOL FLAT PROGRAM FOR EIGHTEEN SCHOOLS ARE CURRENTLY. PARTICIPATING ACTIVELY BY FLYING A COLOR FLAG DEPENDING ON THE AIR QUALITY IN EVERY SCHOOL. DAY TO PROMOTE AIR QUALITY CONDITIONS AND RAISE AWARENESS OFTHE START TO THEIR STUDENTS COMMUNITY AND THEIR QUALITY. OF UNHEALTHY AIR QUALITY. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE A TO SCHOOLS CURRENTLY PARTICIPATING THIS PROGRAM WOULD BENEFIT ALL SCHOOLS IN THE SALTON SEA REGION. AND THE LEGISLATURE CAN BE INSTRUMENTAL IN SHIFTING THIS PROGRAM FROM A VOLUNTARY TO MANDATORY PROGRAM FOR ALL SCHOOLS IN THE SALTON SEA REGION. WE HAVE SHARED INFORMATION BY TEN THE LOCAL EVENTS COMMUNITY HEALTH FAIRS. SCHOOL PRESENTATIONS PUBLIC WORKSHOPS AND WORKSHOPS HELD BY AGENCIES WHERE THE SALTON SEA AND PUBLIC HEALTH ARE THE MAIN TOPICS REACHING OVER THREE THOUSAND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ON EIGHTEEN PUBLIC EVENTS OVER THE PAST OUT TWELVE MONTHS. ACTUALLY DOT THE FIRST YEAR OF THIS PROGRAM. WE HAVE RECENTLY STARTED PROMOTING THE CAMPAIGN IN TRADITIONAL MEDIA OUR LOCAL A BECAUSE THAT KNOWN AS ANGELS WILL BE KNOWN AS WHICH DISTRIBUTES OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND THREE COPIES. BIKE WEEKLY TWO THREE HUNDRED NATURE CHEATED LOCATIONS IN IMPERIAL VALLEY DEDICATED TRUCK COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT BEFORE MORE TRADITIONAL MEDIA. WE'VE ALSO BEEN COMMUNICATING THROUGH. TV MEDIA CAMPAIGNS THAT HAS ALSO BEEN ONGOING THROUGH COMMUNITY AT THESE ISSUES A GOOD AYE INFORMING. SOUTH AND SEE THE CAMPAIGN. HAS BEEN RUNNING SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN. AT SIX TO EIGHT DAILY APPEARANCES PER STATION IT IS QUIET RUNNING ON THREE TV STATIONS AND THAT WE SEE ON FOR SPANISH IN PERSON IN IMPERIAL VALLEY. AND FOR THE ENGLISH VERSION CHAOS WTA AND IMPERIAL VALLEY. BANK HERE KATIE FX AND THE COACHELLA VALLEY WHAT WE PRESENT AT THE SALTON SEA. CURRENT SITUATION. AND THESE EFFORTS WE PUT THE BLUEPRINTS SALTON SEA. AND ENGAGE IN OUR COMMUNITY TO STAY INFORMED AND INVOLVED IN THIS MAJOR HEALTH ISSUE THAT AFFECTS OUR COMMUNITY. INCITING THE COMMUNITY TO OUT AND VISIT OUR WEBSITE. ADDITIONAL PARTNERS WORKING WITH COMIC THIS TYPICAL EMBARKED ON AIR MONITORING HELD EXPOSURE ASSESSMENTS AND SALTON SEA SEDIMENT CHARACTERIZATION INCLUDE THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. TRACKING CALIFORNIA. UC DAVIS YOU SEE AS THE AND UCLA THEY'RE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH US. ALTHOUGH THERE IS TREMENDOUS COMBINED EFFORT IN THE REGION TO RAISE AWARENESS AND ENGAGEMENT WHICH HAS BEEN HIGHLY RESPONSIVE. SO THE REQUEST THAT PUBLIC THIS HE RECALL MADE CAR. AS AND WE HAVE OUR MEMBERS THAT THAT WE ACTUALLY CAME HERE THREE YEARS AGO. AND AND MUCH OF LOS EDUCATION AND CASEMENT. OF GOALS HAVE HAVE BEEN MET. THAT TEN YEAR PLAN IS MOVING AT A MUCH LOWER RATE. THEN WHAT WE THAN WHAT OUR COMMUNITY IS DEMANDING. WE NEED TO SEE ACTION A PERHAPS AN ACHIEVABLE TIMELINE FOR PROJECTS. AND EFFORTS TO HAPPEN AROUND THE SALTON SEA. IT IS CRUCIAL TO CONTINUE TO GET SUPPORT TOWARD PEACE EFFORTS OF EDUCATING AND INFORMING AND ENGAGING COMMUNITY ABOUT CHANGES. AND IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN THE SALTON SEA. SAW RECOMMENDATIONS ARE THAT THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE AN INCREASE COLLABORATION AMONGST ALL PARTIES. LET ME PISSY VEHICLE MEMBERS AND STAKEHOLDERS. OUR STAKEHOLDERS AT THE SALTON SEA REGION AND WE COMMIT TO CONTRIBUTE TO THAT COLLABORATION IN THE AREAS OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND PUBLIC HEALTH. THERE IS ALSO A NEED FOR AN ACCELERATED COLLABORATION TO FACILITY PERMITTING AND EASEMENTS. THAT MAY BE DELAYING PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND I WAS RECENTLY INFORMED THAT. THAT THESE OBSTACLES ARE GETTING RESOLVED. WHICH IS PROMISING PROGRESS. HISTORY HAS PROVEN THAT WE CANNOT TAKE FOCUS OFF. A MAINTAINING A PRIOR IT TAXATION OF THE MOST URGENT STABILISATION PROJECTS. THAT. THAT ONCE THE STABILIZE WANT TO SEE IT STABILIZE AT THE MOST THE MISSIVE EXPOSED AREA. THEN WE CAN HAVE POSITIVE A BACK IN DRIVING INVESTOR CONFIDENCE FOR DEVELOPMENT AND TOURISM WHICH CAN FURTHER REVITALIZED THE SALTON SEA REGION. ALL PROJECTS SHOULD ADDRESS BUT NOT LIMITED TO WILDLIFE HABITAT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND PUBLIC HEALTH AS MEASURES OF SUCCESS. NATURAL RESOURCE IS AGENCY NEEDS A DIRECTED BY THE LEGISLATURE TO ADOPT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND PUBLIC HEALTH POLICIES TO BE INSTITUTIONALIZED WITHIN ITS AGENCY PROGRAMS AND DEPARTMENTS. BRUCE WILCOX THE SUFFICIENT STAFF. THAT NEEDS TO BE ASSIGNED TO THE SALTON SEA. I KNOW THIS IS POSSIBLE BECAUSE CALIFORNIA RESOURCE PORCH JUST MADE A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE PURSUANT AB SIX SEVENTEEN. SO WHEN AGENCIES ARE WILLING TO SOLVE PROBLEMS THERE IS EVIDENCE THEY CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN. WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING INSIGHT. IT'S ALSO A GOOD TIME TO REVISIT THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. ONE THAT IS EFFICIENT AND. CAN DELIVER. GOOD OUTCOMES. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY. OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY MY NAME IS PHIL ROSENTRADERS SERVICE THE GENERAL MANAGER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE SALTON SEA AUTHORITY. WE ARE A JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY THAT IS EMPOWERED TO ENGAGE IN REVITALIZATION EFFORTS AT THE SALTON SEA WERECOMPRISED OF THE ESSENTIAL LOCAL ENTITIES AROUND THE SEE THAT HAVE. LAND USE JURISDICTION WATER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT. YEAH AND PROPERTY OWNERSHIP THE ESSENTIAL INGREDIENTS YOU WANT TO HAVE AT THE TABLE FOR GOING TO FASHION REALISTIC FEASIBLE SOLUTIONS. THAT JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY HAS BEEN ENGAGE IN A. HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE WAY WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN FACT WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS BUT A LOT OF TALK ABOUT DELAYS AND. OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF A DO NOTHING SCENARIO THAT DO NOTHING SCENARIO WHICH COULD BE DEVASTATING ON OUR ECOSYSTEM ARE. HUMAN HEALTH IMPACTS OUR HABITAT. AND IT COULD ALSO DESTROY OUR ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES THE LOCALS UNDERSTAND THIS BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE BECAUSE WE ARE THE ONES WHO WILL SUFFER IF NOTHING IS DONE. WE TAKE THIS VERY SERIOUSLY WEAR THE. I WOULD ARGUE THE MOST HIGHLY MOTIVATED OF ANYONE YOU WILL FIND AROUND THE SALTON SEA IN ANY OF THESE DISCUSSIONS. AND THAT IS WHY WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS THE LOCALS DROVE THE INITIATIVE THE LOCALS CAME UP THE UNDER CONTRACT WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY THE SALTON SEA AUTHORITY PRODUCED A FINANCIAL FEASIBILITY ACTION PLAN. ON TIME ON BUDGET. LET ME REPEAT ON TIME ON BUDGET THESE ARE LOCALS UNDER WORKING TOGETHER UNIFIED. A SENSE OF WITH THE SALT SEA AT THE ALREADY. IN COOPERATION WITH THE STATE WE PRODUCE SOMETHING THAT WAS VALUABLE THAT SERVES AS THE FOUNDATION OF THE SALT SEA MANAGEMENT PLAN. THAT IS A MODEL THAT HAS WORKED AND I SUBMIT TO YOU SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS. PART OF THE SOLUTION MOVING FORWARD HAD WE KEEP THINGS ON TRACK LET'S LOOK AT WHAT WORKS WHAT HAS WORKED. AND WHAT IS CONTINUING TO WORK OH I SUBMITTED SOME WRITTEN TESTIMONY. PER REQUEST FROM THE CHAIR THAT WILL GO INTO ALL THE DETAILS CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO READ IT IN THE INTEREST TIME. BUT LET ME CUT TO THE CHASE WITH THE LOCALS LEAD WE ALL SUCCEED AN EXAMPLE THIS IN RECENT MEMORY THE LAST MONTH. THE LOCALS WITH THE SALT SEA AUTHORITY HAS LEAD AGENCY UNDER CONTRACT WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE TOWARDS MARTINEZ CAHUILLA DESERT TRIBE. PLEADED THE FIRST PHASE OF THE TOWARDS MARTINEZ WETLANDS PROJECT. THIS IS THE FIRST STATE FUNDED PROJECT EVER COMPLETED AT THE SALTON SEA. WHILE IT IS SMALL IT IS CERTAINLY OF MONUMENTAL IN THE FACT IT IS BEGINNING OF FIRST TANGIBLE STEP. TOWARD WHAT MUST HAPPEN A THOUSAND TIMES OVER. NOW WE HAVE THE MEANS WE HAVE THE CAPABILITY THE COMPETENCY OF THE LOCAL LEVEL. TO DELIVER ON TIME ON BUDGET AS THAT PROJECT WAS AS WELL IS THE FINANCIAL FEASIBILITY ACTION PLAN I MENTIONED EARLIER. SO WE HAVE THE MOTIVATION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IN CONCERT. WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE STATE AND I THINK THAT IS THE KEY WORKING THE LOCALS INTO A SENSE OF WHAT THE STATE OF HOW WE GET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON BOARD. NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF THE LOCALS HAD NOT SET ASIDE DIFFERENCES. LONG YEARS AGO THAT SEPARATED THEM AND DID NOT ALLOW THEM TO MOVE FORWARD AND UNIFIED FASHION ON PLANS AND PROJECTS. AND IT AT A UNITED EFFORT APPEARS SACRAMENTO AND BACK IN DC WHAT THE LOCALS CAME TOGETHER WE STARTED TO SEE PROGRESS. THEY AGREED THAT THEY SHOULD ESTHER LOCAL LEADERSHIP. AND WITHOUT THAT IF WE JUST CONTINUE TO GO DOWN THE PATH OF TRUSTING THE STATE TO MOVE. AND MAKE THINGS HAPPEN. OF LOCAL FRANKLY HAD VERY LITTLE FAITH THAT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN ANYTHING PRODUCTIVE. THE LOCALS DECIDED THEY WOULD. OF ADOPT A SET OF GUIDING PRINCIPLE THE SOLVENCY OF THE WORD HE HAS THREE GETTING PRINCIPLES A CERTAIN LOCAL. LEADERSHIP WHICH WE HAVE DONE AND WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED. SECOND. LET'S HAVE MULTIPLE BENEFITS OUT OF EVERY DOLLAR INVESTED. WE HAVE MULTIPLE CHALLENGES LET'S MAKE SURE THOSE CHALLENGES ARE INTEGRATED THE PLANNING WAY THE STATE HAS DONE THIS THEY ARE UNDER IT LEGAL OBLIGATION TO DO THIS. IN FACT TO A DUSTY HABITAT AND THE HUMAN HEALTH CONDITIONS. THE LOCAL WOULD LIKE TO SEE OPPORTUNITIES IN ECONOMIC SECTOR FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY AND RECREATION INCORPORATED BECAUSE THAT IS THE. MEANS WERE TALK ABOUT FUNDING IN IMPLEMENTATION. HOW DO WE SET UP GOVERNMENT'S WORKS WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT HOW WE SET UP FUNDING MECHANISMS AT WORK AND? THE LOCALS AND THE SALT SEA THOR IN OUR LOCAL PARTNERS. HAVE. ESTABLISH THAT AS PART OF OUR GUIDING PRINCIPLE THE THIRD IS IF WE DEVELOP THESE RESOURCES LOCALLY WILL MAKE SURE. THAT THERE IS A IF THERE. CONTROLLED ERROR ON PUBLIC LAND ROB DIBBLE PUBLIC RESOURCES THAT THEY BRING THE PUBLIC BENEFIT BACK TO THE COMMUNITY AND ARE VESTED. IN THE LONG TERM SOLUTION THAT THE C. RATHER EXTRACTED AND. REDIRECTED ELSEWHERE. WE HAVE. SEATED ON A VERY SMALL SCALE WE A. FIRST STEP IT'S BEEN COMPLETED WE HAVE LONG WAY TO GO BUT THAT JOURNEY OF A THOUSAND MILES BEGINS WITH THAT FIRST STEP AND I'M HAPPY TO SAY. THE CELL SEE AUTHORITY AND ITS LOCAL PARTNERS WORKING WITH THE STATE. HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL WE NEED TO CONTINUE THAT UPWARD TRAJECTORY. I OF WHAT YOUR QUESTION PATRICIA. I THINK YOU. TEMMINCK I SEE. AS SO FIRST I FILLED UP US ON THE DIRECTOR OF BUILDING HEALTHY COMMUNITIES SAN THE COACHELLA VALLEY. AND IT BUILDING HEALTHY COMMUNITIES WHERE COMPOSED OF VARIOUS NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AND RESIDENTS WHO WORK TOGETHER AND SEEK. POLICY AND SYSTEM SOLUTION THAT ARE GOING TO ADDRESS THE PUBLIC HEALTH NEEDS OF OUR REGION. IN OUR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE WORK WE ACCOUNT WITH THE OTHER MEMBERS OF OUR TEAM WITH CONCRETE DESIGN INITIATIVE ON SO THEY'RE DESIGNERS AND PLANNERS ON CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE FOR RURAL STUDIES. COACHELLA UNINCORPORATED YOUTH MEDIUM. TOM AUDUBON. I LOW MULLIN THE UNIVERSITY AND I'M SIERRA CLUB SO WE BELIEVE THAT HAVE THAT THE GROUP THAT WE HAVE REALLY BRINGS THE EXPERTISE ALONG WITH THE RESIDENTS. TO COME UP WITH SOME SOLUTIONS THAT OUR. THAT ARE GOING TO ADDRESS INITIAL HOLISTICALLY AND. GREEN REALLY THE TYPES OF NEEDS THAT WE NEED TO SEE A CONSULTANCY. SO I'VE FOUGHT YOU HAVE A PRESENTATION IN FRONT OF YOU I'VE FOUND IT. DIVIDED INTO FOUR MAJOR. TALKING POINTS ONE OF THEM I'M GOING TO START BY TALKING ABOUT THE GAPS WITHIN THE SOLVENCY MANAGEMENT PLAN. PARTICULARLY I SAID I'M PERTAINS TO COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT ON THEN I WILL MOVE AHEAD AND. PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR A PARTICIPATORY ENGAGEMENT ON THEM. AND DISCUSS SUB POTENTIAL BENEFITS THAT LUCK. AT SOLUTIONS BEYOND US MITIGATION AND. THEN WE DO PROVIDE SOME REQUEST OF FOR THE STATE. SO BRIEFLY TO START ON THE GAPS WITHIN THE SALTON SEA I'VE BEEN ON IN EACH AND THE ISSUE OF THE SALTON SEA SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TEN WHEN I USED TO WORK ON FIRE. FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER A AND ON SINCE THEN UNTIL NOW ONE OF THE. MEAN GAPS IN TALKING ABOUT THE SOUTH AND SEE IF THAT IT'S ON AGENCY DRIVEN. AND SO THE PRIORITIES OF THE AGENCIES COME ON AT THE TOP OF THE PROCESS BUT THERE'S THE MISSING COMPONENT OF COMMUNITY VOIGTS. IF AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE. BEAUTIFUL MAP THAT WAS PRESENTED BY ON THE STATE YOU VERY ACCURATELY SEE WHY WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE SALTON SEA YOU SEE HOW RAPIDLY ON THE SEA IS DECLINING. AND YOU ALSO SEE WHERE THE PROJECTS ARE GOING TO BE LOCATED BUT WHAT'S MORE IMPORTNT IS WHAT YOU DO NOT SEE ON THAT MATTER. WHAT YOU DO NOT SEE ON THAT MAP IS HOW CLOSE COMMUNITIES ARE LEADING TO THE SALTON SEA? AND TO WHETHER THESE COMMUNITIES GET TO. BENEFIT DIRECTLY FROM SOME OF THE PROJECTS THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED SO IN THE PRESENTATION IN FRONT OF YOU. I DID OUT PUT A MAP RIGHT NEXT TO IT THAT SHOWS. AND. BREAD AND THE THE REASON THAT THESE COMMUNITIES ARE RED IS BECAUSE THEY ARE DEEPLY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND YOU. pTWENTY SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT ARE LIVING IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE SEA. AND THERE ARE OF FOR COMMUNITIES BONE BY BEACH NORTH SHORE. ANON. ARE THE SALTON SEA AREAWEST CHOICE AREA THAT REALLY IN THE TEN YEAR PLAN DO NOT GIVE ADDRESSED HOME OUT EXCEPT I SHOULD SAY THAT THERE ARE SOME RECENT ATTEMPTS THAT MAYBE ARE NOT REFLECTED IN THE TEN YEAR PLAN TO DO SOMETHING IN WEST SHORE SINCE I'VE HEARD RECENTLY. I'M SO WHY I'M THAT IS IMPORTANT WILL IT'S NOT ONLY ON THAT MAP BUT WHEN YOU LOOK THAT TEN WHEN YOU READ AT THE. TEN YEAR PLAN. YOU ALSO SEE THAT OF ARE COMMUNITIES ARE NOT REFLECTED IN THE METHODOLOGIES THAT ARE USED TO IDENTIFY. PROJECTS. OR. OR THE LOCATION FOURTHS OF SUCH PROJECTS SO ON THE TEN YEAR PLAN STIPULATES THAT THE AIR QUALITY MITIGATION WILL CONSIST OF MEASURES TO KEEP EXPOSE PLAYA WET. OR VEGETATED. IT ALSO SAYS THAT DETERMINATION OF PI EMISSIVITY WILL DRIVE THE LOCATION OF THAT DUST SUPPRESSION PROJECTS NEITHER THE PROJECTS WERE MITIGATING DOES NOR THE CITING OF THESE PROJECTS TO GIVE SENATE CONSIDERATION TO IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE. SO BY OVERLAYING THE CURRENT MAP WITH THE EXISTING COMMUNITIES I REALLY THINK THAT ON IT COULD SERVE THE STATE ASSEMBLY MINDER THAT THE STATE HAS AN OBLIGATION THAT'S FAR GREATER THAN ADHERING TO THE QUANTIFICATION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT. AND THE RECENTLY AMENDED STIPULATED ORDER THE STATE HAS AN OBLIGATION TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC HEALTH OF ALL CALIFORNIANS ONTO THIS AND. HEALTH IS TO BE UNDERSTOOD IN ITS BROAD DEFINITION TO INCLUDE THE CONDITIONS IN THE ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH PEOPLE. ARE BORN LIVE LEARN WORK PLAY WORSHIP AND EIGHTEEN SH THAT AFFECT A WIDE RANGE OF HEALTH FUNCTIONING AND SO. THE PREVIOUS PRESENTATION. TALKED ABOUT OUTREACH AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THE STATE HAS COME A LONG WAYS IN THEIR WILLINGNESS TO ON TO. OUTREACH BUT. AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL BUT WE WANT TO SEE IF SINGLE ANCIENT IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT PROCESS. OUTREACHES WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW WHERE THERE'S A PUBLIC FORUM. MAYBE THERE SOME FIRING IN THE COMMUNITY THEIR SEN FORMATION GIVEN SIMILAR TO THE INFORMATION THAT WAS PROVIDED. TO YOU ALL THE AND WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW AND THEN THE RESPONSE FROM THE COMMUNITY IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE RESPONSE THAT WE SAW ON THE DICE. THERE'S FRUSTRATION AND THERE'S REALLY NO VENUE FOR INPUT NOW WE KNOW THAT. AT THE COMMUNITY ON THE COMMUNITY THAT WE HAVE IN THE EASTERN COULD TELL ABOUT THE IT'S REALLY ARE REGION'S GREATEST ASSET THEY ARE VERY ACTIVE IN IMPROVING THEIR OWN HEALTH AND THAT OF THEIR NEIGHBORS. WITHIN AN EXTREMELY RESOURCE LIMITED ENVIRONMENT ON WORKING IN COLLABORATION WITH BUILDING HEALTHY COMMUNITIES ON THE RESIDENTS OF NORTH SHORE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY WORK TO EXTEND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION TO THE REMOTE COMMUNITY. AND SECURED AGREEMENTS AMONG SEVERAL AGENCIES TO BUILD THE PARK. AND SO AGAIN WE NEED TO START LOOKING AT OUR COMMUNITIES ASK PEOPLE WHO HAVE SOMETHING TO OFFER THEY HAVE THE EXPERTISE THEY DEAL WITH THE SEA ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS WE MIGHT NOT BE. OR THAT TYPICAL PERSON INCLUDING MYSELF ARE NOT DESIGNERS ARE. PLANNERS BUT WE UNDERSTAND HOW TO NAVIGATE OUR COMMUNITY SO I THINK WORKING WITH THE EXPERTISE THAT'S PROVIDED BY THE STATE WE WOULD HAVE A MORE ON HOLISTIC APPROACH. I'M SO I DO OFFER SOME KEY CRITERIA. THAT WE SEE NECESSARY FOR A TRUE PARTICIPATORY ENGAGEMENT ON PROCESS AND WE. FIRST OF ALL IS THAT WE NEED TO SEE THE PROCESS AS ONE THAT IS INTEGRATED AND. AS THE TEN YEAR PLAN HAS HAPPENED IS THE PLANNING HAPPEN ON ONE END AND NOW IT'S LIKE WE'RE BACK PEDALING TO GOING INFORM THE COMMUNITY WE HAVE NEVER SAT DOWN TO REALLY THINK ABOUT WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO. AND WHAT IS ALL OF OUR RESPONSIBILITIES AND HOW ARE WE GOING TO REALLY BRING SOLUTIONS THAT ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE LIVING NEAR THE SEA. THANKS AGAIN ONE INTEGRATED PROCESS A SECOND AS WE NEED ENGAGE IN FACILITATION A COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT NEEDS TO BE A TWO WAY STREET. THIS REQUIRES THE STATE TO BE WILLING TO LEARN AND KNOW HOW TO ASK QUESTIONS AND ENGAGE IN DIALOGUE THAT COULD INFORM A POSSIBLE ACTION. THERE NEEDS TO BE GENUINE INTEREST IN LISTENING TO AND REFLECTING THE NEEDS THE CONCERNS THAT DREAMS THAT THIS COMMUNITY HAS FOR THE SEAT. ACCESSIBILITY. FOCUSING ON THE PROCESS ALLOWS THE MEETINGS WITH THE COMMUNITY TO BECOME OPPORTUNITIES TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS RATHER THAN SIMPLE TRANSACTION. TO. BUILD SOLUTIONS RATHER THAN BEING ON OPPOSITE ENDS OF WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN OF THE SCENE. AT THE SCENE. AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT. TO LOOK AS MUCH AS TO WHO WITHIN THE ROOM. WHERE THE MEETINGS ARE LOCATED ON HOW THE INFORMATION IS PRESENTED? AND THE SPACES NEED TO BE COMFORTABLE. FOR RESIDENTS WHERE INFORMAL ENGAGEMENT AS WELL AS. LOCAL KNOWLEDGE ARE VALUED AS MUCH AS THE AGENCY PRESENTATIONS AND DATE. AND FINALLY FOR THIS. PORTION IS THE STATE REALLY NEEDS TO EMBRACE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCEPT ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE COMMUNITY. MANY OF THE QUESTIONS. THAT WE OWE HERE IN FORUMS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE MONEY HOW IS IT SPENT AND. I MEAN THE FIRST PRESENTATION GIVE US VERY GOOD INFORMATION ON THAT BUT BEYOND THAT I THINK THE STATE NEEDS TO BE CLEAR AND SET CLEAR PARAMETERS THAT DEFINE THE PURPOSE OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. AND THE EXPECTED OUTCOMES FROM IT WHAT IS THE PURPOSE TO ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY IF OUR INPUT IS AT THE END WILL NOTBE REFLECTED ON THE PLAN. AT THAT'S THE KEYS STONING AGENTS. THAT AND THEN MOVING ON TO. COLD BENEFITS BEYOND DUST MITIGATION SO AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THE TEN YEAR PLAN FAILED TO CONSIDER HOW ITS HABITAT AND THAT'S MITIGATION EFFORTS IMPACT QUALITY OF LIFE. YET THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE TO CONSIDER THE ACHIEVEMENT OF CO BENEFITS IN MANAGING THE SALTON SEA. RELIEF FOR THE STATE TO US WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO LEVERAGE THE RESOURCES ON THAT ARE AVAILABLE THAT THE STATE AND LOCAL. AND FEDERAL LEVEL. DOES STATE NEEDS TO EMBRACE THE CONCEPT THAT BEYOND MEETING ITS OBLIGATION TO MITIGATE DOES STATE CAN ADDRESS EXISTING COMMUNITY NEEDS THAT IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE. SO. AGAIN BUT I AM PERCENT MEAN. NEXT IS JUST AN IDEA OF WHAT CALL BENEFITS GIVEN THE KNOWLEDGE AND THE ENGAGEMENT THAT MY MY ORGANIZATION DOES. BUT IT IS NOT PRESCRIPTIVE I'M SO WANT SOME OF THE THINGS IS THAT WE WANT TO SEE INCREASE RECREATIONAL SPACE WE WANT TO SEE IMPROVED ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY PARTICULARLY LOCAL JOBS. A CONSERVATION OF THE ECOSYSTEM PROTECTION FROM INCLEMENT WEATHER PARTICULARLY DUST AND HEAT IMPROVE MOBILITY AND THE REASON WHY I SAY IS THAT AND THESE ARE NOT PRESCRIPTIVE IS BECAUSE WHERE. THESE PROJECTS HAPPEN ON HOW THEY LOOK REALLY NEEDS TO BE INFORMED BY A COMMUNITY DE SIGNED LET. PROCESS. I'M AND THEN FINALLY THE REQUEST THAT WE HAVE FOR THE STATE. WE WANT TO SEE A TRUE COMMIT ON TRUE COMMITMENT TO COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT WE WANT THE STATE TO DEVELOP A PUBLIC HEALTH PROJECTS THAT ARE IN PROXIMITY TO THE DISADVANTAGED POPULATIONS. AND THAT THESE PROJECTS GO BEYOND US MITIGATION. I'M WE WOULD LIKE OF FOR THE PURPOSES OF HAVING MEANINGFUL COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT THAT THE TEN YEAR PLAN IDENTIFIES THE KEY DECISION POINTS IN WHICH COMMUNITY INPUT. WILL SERVE A PURPOSE WE. AGAIN AS I STATED EARLIER HAVING RECEIVING JUST INFORMATION DOES NOT ALLOW FOR THAT ON PURPOSE OF THE INFORMATION SPUR SENATE ASSET THAT STUNNED. PHONE. INCLUDE ADDITIONAL. POINTS FOR PROPOSALS IN THE RFP PROCESS THAT INCLUDE A COMMUNITY. ENGAGEMENT DE SIGNED PROCESS. VALUE IT EARLIER WE HEARD THAT THERE MIGHT NOT BE BIDDING THERE MIGHT BE A DESIGN BUILD PROCESS. WHICHEVER ONE IT IS. I THINK WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A COMMUNITY TO SIGN AND GET THEM INVOLVED IN IT AND PROJECTS WOULD DO THAT TO RECEIVE MORE POINTS. WE WOULD LIKE TO DEVELOP. WE WOULD LIKE FOR THE STATE TO DEVELOP A LONG TERM PROCESS FOR SEEKING SOLUTIONS TO THE SALTON SEA. NOT INCLUDE THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS AS KEY STAKEHOLDERS AND. I WILL LEAVE YOU OR OFFER A TWO TOOLS THAT CAN GET US WHO MORE AUTHENTIC ON COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND THAT IS PARTICIPATORY BUDGETING I KNOW THAT THE LEGISLATURE HANS I MEAN IF THE BOND PASSES. ON THEIR SOME MONEY EVEN THAT'S GOING TO BE ALLOCATED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. COULD THERE BE A. PARTICIPATORY BUDGETING SO THAT THE COMMUNITY CAN DECIDE HOW THOSE DOLLARS SHOULD BE SPENT AND WHERE. ON AND THE OTHER ONE WHICH I'VE MENTIONED SEVERAL TIMES. DISTANT FOR IT'S AN ON GOING NOTICES HAVING COMMUNITY LET DECENT. THINK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL OF THE PRESENTATIONS AYE I'LL START WITH. THE DOCTORS. COMMENTS. YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S A REMINDER. OF THE STATE OF EMERGENCY THAT THAT. THIS PROBLEM PRESENTS. AND. IT IS IN BY. COINCIDENCE THAT THAT. YOU WRAP UP THIS HEARING WITH REMIND YOU KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT IS AT STAKE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. SO WE WENT THROUGH THE SECOND PANEL AND WE GOT A GOOD. OVERVIEW OF WHAT'S HAPPENING OR NOT HAPPENING IN WHERE YOU KNOW. EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE TO GET ON TRACK. TO GETTING THESE PROJECTS UNDER WAY. BUT HAVING YOU ALL PRESENT YEAR THE LOCAL PERSPECTIVE I THINK IS EXTREMELY. A THE WAY THAT THIS CONVERSATION ALWAYS NEEDS TO START AND AND. IS THAT THERE ARE REAL PEOPLE WITH REAL. DANGERS BEFORE THEM. AS THE. IT HAS BEEN PRESENTED YOU KNOW THERE'S COMMUNITIES WITH CLOSE AT THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT RESIDE. IN THAT AREA I I DON'T WANT TO. YOU KNOW. TAKE AWAY FROM THE INCREMENTAL PROGRESS THAT'S BEEN MADE. WITHOUT QUESTION PUTTING TOGETHER THE PLAN BY THE LOCALS COMING TOGETHER. A FUNDING ALLOCATION OF EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS TWO YEARS AGO AND NOW THE POTENTIAL OF HAVING FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS BUT YOU KNOW TO ME THAT'S LIKE. CELEBRATING THAT THE DODGERS MADE IT TO THE WORLD SERIES IT. BUT THEN IT WENT. RIGHT. AND WE'RE NOT QUITE THERE YET AS IT RELATES TO WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. WITH THE SALTON SEA IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLAN. UP DOCTOR YOU YOU MENTIONED SOMETHING AND I JUST WANTED TO GET A CONFIRMATION IF I IF I WROTE THIS DOWN CORRECTLY. AS YOU SAID THE SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE DUST. PROBLEMS IN THE COACHELLA VALLEY ORIGINATE FROM THE EXPOSED SOIL SURROUNDING THE SULTAN T. IS THAT. RIGHT THERE THE PAPER LAST YEAR THAT SOME SOME OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE DUST I'M YOU CAN ACTUALLY DETERMINE WHETHER IT'S SAFE FROM DESERT SOILS THAT SORT OF THING. AND THE ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT SET UP TO SEVENTY PERCENT IS COMING DIRECTLY FROM THE EXPOS PLY. BETTER. THE A NUMBER THAT I THINK. I'VE NOT HEARD BEFORE. NEARLYTOUCHED ON THE POPE PULMONARY CARDIOVASCULAR. A DISEASE PROBLEMS PERCENTAGES THE CAUSES OF SPECIFIC. YOU KNOW MORAL YOU KNOW OUTCOMES AS A RESULT OF NEO CERTAIN AND ACTIVITIES GOING ON. YOU MENTIONED THE RESPIRATORY DISEASE STATISTICS AMONGST CHILDREN IN THE REGION BUT THAT'S NOT A A STATISTIC THAT I HAVE HEARD BEFORE. CERTAINLY IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE TO HIGHLIGHT AS THE. EXPOSURE OF THE PLAYA CONTINUES TO GROW RIGHT CLEARLY THAT NUMBER WILL CONTINUE TO AFFECT. THE AIR QUALITY IN THE REGION AND THAT WITHOUT A DOUBT WE KNOW. THAT THAT WILL TRANSLATE INTO GREATER PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEMS. AND FOR SOME PEOPLE YOU KNOW THEY LOOK AT THIS FROM A PERSPECTIVE OF THE ECONOMICS.% BOTH TO THE HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. ARE AS WELL AS THE ECONOMIC VIBRANCY OF THE REGION RIGHT AND SO WHICHEVER WAY YOU LOOK AT IT THERE CERTAINLY TREMENDOUS. IMPACT THEIR. AYE YOU TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. DE DOES SUPPRESSION PROJECTS WENT LIMP PROJECTS DESCRIBED. HOW DO YOU SEE THIS AFFECTING IN YOUR OPINION I JUST BASED ON PRESENTATIONS A RESEARCH THAT YOU'VE DONE? TO DECREASE THAT SEVENTY PERCENT I MEAN I ARE THESE THE PROJECTS THAT WILL. BE ABLE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE. I AIR QUALITY PROBLEMS THAT LEAD TO THE SEVENTY PERCENT DUSTIN THEM THAT WE'VE HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS WITHIN THE BREED CENTER ON ON THE QUESTION I THINK. THERE ISN'T AN IN THE MANAGEMENT PLAN THAT THERE ISN'T A LOT OF DETAIL ON WHETHER OR NOT. THESE. DUST SUPPRESSION. ACTIVITIES ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE AND I THINK THAT'S ONE CONCERN BECAUSE THE EXPOS PIE'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO GROW. SOME I WOULD ALSO. MENTION THAT YOU KNOW WHERE ALSO HAVING TO LOOK AT IT YOU DON'T JUST HAVE TO LIVE BY THE SHORES OF SOUND SEEM TO BE AFFECTED BECAUSE OF THE PARTICLE TRANSPORT REALLY GOES THROUGHOUT THE. COACHELLA VALLEY. AND SO. THAT IS A CONCERN NOT JUST LOCALLY TOM TO THE DUST AT THE AT THE PLAYA BUT ALSO EXTENDING THROUGH THE. VALLEY. ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS I THINK THAT IS ALSO RELEVANT TO THINK OF IN TERMS OF THE TOM POPULATIONS THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE AFFECTED. MAIN BE SOMETHING TO IT CAN THE CONSIDERATION BEYOND JUST THE. DUST AND THE DUST SUPPRESSION BUT ALSO AT THE LEVEL OF WHERE PEOPLE LIVE WHERE THEY WORK. KIND OF TAKING AN ASSESSMENT OF WHAT EXPOSURES AND WHAT RISKS WE ARE ACTUALLY. NAM THAT. SEEING AMONG THE COMMUNITIES I THINK THAT MAYBE ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE TO LOOK AT. THANK YOU I I WANNA THAT GET INTO THE COMMUNITY OUR REGION GAUGE MEANT THAT CONVERSATION WHICH OUR LAST PRESENTER. TOUCHED ON. AN OUR SECOND PRESENTER WHO IS TASKED WITH SOME OF THAT. A. WHAT'S THE GAP THAT WE NEED TO KIND OF FILL IN HERE BECAUSE. ON ONE AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE DOING OUTREACH ENGAGEMENT. IN THE COMMUNITY AND WE JUST HEARD FROM OUR LAST PRESENTER THAT THERE ISN'T ENOUGH GOING ON NOT NOT JUST WITH THE. DEVELOPMENT OF THE PLAN WHICH IS THE I THINK THE FOCAL POINT OF THE PRESENTATION. UP BUT IN TERMS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING MOVING FORWARD IT IS THERE A GAP THAT NEEDS TO BE FILLED HERE CLEARLY THAT'S MY TAKE WAY THAT THERE IS. THAT PERHAPS MR OLD METAL IS THERE SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO. BE DONE ON OF THE PART OF THAT YOUR ROLE IN THE COACHELLA VALLEY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE COMMUNICATE WITHOUT REACH. ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED. YEAH NO I A COMPLETELY AGREE A THINK THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL YOU KNOW YOU CAN GO OUT OF MICROSCALE WHERE YOU'D. IMPLEMENTING NEIGHBORHOOD. AS STRATEGIES YELL OR REGIONAL STRATEGIES I THINK THAT. WE NEED TO YOU KNOW VISIT DAY EVERY POSSIBLE. A TOOL THAT'S OUT THERE HOW WE CAN REACH THE HIGH REACH POPULATION SPAS THAT'S WHAT WE DUBBED IT THE HARD TO REACH POPULATIONS. OF SOME OF THE REMEDIES CAN OCCUR AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ME THE IDEAL SITUATION WOULD BE THAT FOR EVERY ACRE EXPOSE WE HAVE A DOSE OF MITIGATION YOU KNOW FOR THAT ACRE BUT IT'S NOT HAPPENING AT THAT RATE. THE REALITY IS IS THAT COMMUNITY WILL HELP WAS ALREADY EXPOSED TO HIGH LEVELS OF P. M. EVEN BEFORE THE SEA BECAME. THE MAJOR PROBLEM I CAN TELL YOU THAT THREE YEARS AGO WE WERE FOCUS ON THE LOCAL STRATEGIES DEALING WITH LOCAL SOURCES DEALING WITH. PM COMING FROM LOCAL INDUSTRY COMING FROM DESERT OFFROAD COMING FROM AGRICULTURE FROM MANY DIFFERENT SOURCES NOW ATTENTION IS NOW HAVING TO GO TO OUR MAJOR SOLIS SEAVER DOT DRIVERS NOT TIME I HEAR THAT SCARY NUMBER SEVENTY PERCENT. IT DOES SEEM THAT JUST YOU KNOW VISUALLY THOSE OF US WHO LIVE THERE. COULD PROBABLY SAY YEAH THAT'S DEATHLY SEEMS ABOUT RIGHT. ARE. IN TERMS OF OUR DEAN WHAT'S A LARGER FIX THAT'S WHAT I THINK TIME AND TIME AGAIN OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS I HAVE SAID NATURAL RESOURCES. NEEDS TO ADOPT PUBLIC HEALTH POLICIES THEY NEED TO ADOPT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE POLICIES. WE CANNOT REVERSE. IN A HALF A CENTURY OF THIS ENGAGEMENT FROM THE COMMUNITY. THAT HAS NOT DELIBERATELY BEEN ENGAGED ON THE SALTON SEA OUT COMMUNITIES HAVE NOT HISTORICALLY BEEN INVITED. TO THE SALTON SEA REGION OTHER THAN BE MADE AWARE LIKE STAY AWAY FROM YOU KNOW THE DRAINAGE RAVER STAY AWAY FROM. THE SALTON SEE THAT WE DON'T HAVE A CULTURE OF APPRECIATING UNTIL MOST RECENTLY THE HABITAT THE WILDLIFE. OTHER THINGS IN AND OTHER ARTICLE ARTICLE TREASURES THAT EXIST IN THAT AREA. YES I% THINK THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE AN INCREASE OF RESOURCES THE BOTTOM THE NORSE INSIGHT ON ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ON HEALTH AS WELL AS THE SOUTHERN SIDE AND THERE ARE OTHERS CONTRIBUTORS ARE OUT THERE. SAYING YOU KNOW WE WANT TO INVEST YOU KNOW THERE'S HEALTH CONVINCED TO SAY WE WANT INVEST ANNOUNCEMENT EVENTUALLY ONE INVEST ON SCHOOL FLAT PROGRAMS WE WANT AND BASS I'M MORE% MONITORING. YOU KNOW AND THIS CAN BE DONE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE SEA ENGAGEMENT IS A MAJOR GOAL IS FOR THE COMMUNITY BEING GAUGE. BUT TO REVERSED YOU KNOW HALF A CENTURY OR MORE OF THIS ENGAGEMENT OR PERHAPS EVEN THE LIBERAL IT. LACK OF ENGAGEMENT IT'S IT'S NOT GONNA BE A YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA BE SOLVED OVERNIGHT IT'S GONNA BE. A IS THAT WE NEED TO MULTIPLY THE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE I THINK IT'S GOING TO YIELD POSITIVE OUTCOMES BUT IS NOT THE OVER A FIX IT'S A TEMPORARY FIX BECAUSE WE NEED TO MITIGATE. THE FACT THAT PEOPLE WILL BE EXPOSED THAT WE DON'T HAVE AN ACRE DOSAGE OF MITIGATION FRED READ ACRE EXPOSE SO EIGHT EIGHT IT AGE A SHORT TERM AND INTERMEDIATE SOLUTION IS. GET THE INFORMATION OUT GET PEOPLE TO HAVE CONTROL OF HOW THEY MAKE ARE. HOW THEY? I ADJUSTED DAILY ACTIVITIES TO REDUCE EXPOSURE TO THESE HAZARDOUS CONTAMINANTS RIGHTS OUTSIDE WOULD SAY THAT YES WE NEED TO CONTINUE THESE EFFORTS ON THE SOUTHERN END ON AN ANNOUNCEMENT AND. ARE CONTINUE TO INVEST AND ON THESE MULTIPLE DIFFERENT STRATEGIES AND. AND DAHLE A SOVIET PAST YOU KNOW CLEARLY HAS A ROADMAP OF HOW THAT COULD HAPPEN. OGDEN THERE'S OTHERS YOU KNOW THAT THAT CLEARLY HAVE A LOT OF THOSE AND WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE BRING THOSE FOR. MY QUESTION WHAT WHAT DO YOU NEED FROM THE GROUP THAT'S TASKED WITH E. COMMITTING GAVE AN OUTREACH OF ON BEHALF OF THE STATE SO AGAIN THE THINK GAP. I THINK IS THAT THERE IS NO CLEAR POINTS FOR WHEN COMMUNITY IMPLANT. REALLY INFORMS THE STEPS MOVING FORWARD THERE IS AND HAS BEEN. FORUMS WHERE THE COMMUNITY RECEIVES THE SAME INFORMATION THAT YOU ARE RECEIVED FROM THE STATE THIS IS THE MAP THIS IS WHAT WE'RE DOING. THAT IF INFORMATION THAT IS NOT ENGAGEMENT. SO WHAT WE HAVE ASKED THE STATE. AND THE SALTON SEA TEAM THAT'S INVOLVED WITHOUT REACHED ON IS THAT THEY PROVIDE US WITH WHERE ARE THOSE KEY MILESTONES ON BUILDING HEALTHY COMMUNITIES IS ALREADY ENGAGING COMMUNITY. WE WANT TO BRING THEM TO THIS MEETINGS BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S MEANINGFUL AND I'M WE HAVE YET TO RECIEVE FOR THOSE KEY MILESTONES. WILL BE AND WHERE WE CAN TO PROVIDE MEANINGFUL INPUT THE OTHER. GAP LIKE GUINNESS IN THE PLAN. WE ARE A ON PROJECTS ARE BEING LOCATED BASED ON IN THE CITY. IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT NINA NEXT TO NORTH SHORE WEST CHOICE. MECCA THAT THERE'S NO EMISSIVITY IT JUST MEANS MAYBE THAT THERE'S MORE IN SOME AREAS THAN. THAN IN OTHERS. BUT WE'RE NOT PRIORITIZE SEEN THE COMMUNITIES THAT LIVE RIGHT NEXT TO THE SCENE EVEN THAT IF THERE'S LOW EMISSIVITY ON THE WEST OR THE EAST WHY ARE WE NOT DOING ANYTHING THERE. BECAUSE THERE'S MORE EMISSIVITY IN THE SOUTH AND I MEAN I DON'T KNOW HOW NEAR THE COMMUNITIES I'M NOT AS FAMILIAR. WITH HELP NEAR THE COMMUNITIES ARE TO THE SEA BUT I KNOW THAT IN THE COACHELLA VALLEY WERE LIVING RIGHT NEXT TO IT AND THERE'S NOTHING BEING DONE. MISTER ROSE TRAILER YOU HAVE. HAVE BEEN GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE THE LEAD ON SOME PROJECTS. A AYE YOU SHARED A BIT ABOUT THE A TORCH MARTINEZ PARTNERSHIP. THE MAGNITUDE OF PROJECT ISN'T ANYWHERE NEAR THE SCALE OF SOME OF THE PROJECTS THAT WE WERE DISCUSSING EARLIER BUT. CAN YOU CAN YOU JUST STEP APPLY THE SAME. APPROACH METHODOLOGY TWO PROJECTS SAME SIZE OR LARGER AND THE REASON WHY I ASKED THE QUESTION IS YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO BE TASK WITH THAT A CHUNK OF MONEY. POTENTIALLY THE COMES FROM PROP SIXTY EIGHT. ARE THERE PLANS TO GONNA TAKE THAT MONEY AND BEGIN TO IMPLEMENT SOME OF THE STRATEGIES THAT ARE PART OF THE MANAGEMENT PLAN ALREADY. KNOW MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT IS OUR HOPE IS TO TAKE WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED AT THE SCALE OF COURSE MARTINEZ. A WETLANDS PROJECT MANY OF THE SAME. KINDS OF PROCESS SEIZE THE PERMITTING A PROCESS THESE ARE THE SAME WHETHER IT'S A LARGE PROJECT OR A A SMALLER PROJECT SO THE THE THE SAME STEPS HAVE TO BE TAKEN. REGARDLESS OF SCALE IN IN MANY INSTANCES SO WHAT. GOOD BEING ABLE TO TAKE A PUT MORE OF A PILOT SCALE LEARN FROM THAT AND THEN EXPAND THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE WANT TO DO WITH THE SALT SEA WE HAVE A. NEGOTIATIONS RIGHT NOW TO DOUBLE THAT TOWARDS MARTINEZ WETLANDS PROJECT WITH FACE TO THAT'S A MINUTE THAT AS WE SPEAK. DO WILL BEGIN THAT EXPANSION THAT'S I SHOULD CLARIFY THAT'S UNDER A THAT A POT OF MONEY FROM PROPERTY FOR. THIS WOULD NOT BE. TAPPING INTO THAT EIGHTY MILLION THOUGH UNDER PROP ONE OR THAT PROP SIXTY EIGHT BUT OUR EXPECTATION IS THAT. WAS MENTIONED EARLIER OF. S. C. H. IS THE CLOSEST PROJECT THE STATE HAS TO ACTUALLY BEING. THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED CONSTRUCTED. CLOSE ON THE HEELS OF THAT IS A PROJECT CONCEDE THAT THE NORTH AND NORTH LAKE WHICH WOULD BUILD INTO A LARGER. ABOUT. PERIMETER LIKE POTENTIALLY AROUND THE EDGES OF THE SEA THAT WOULD ADDRESS OF THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT TO MY COLLEAGUES AWAY POSIT MENTION. SO OUR INTENT IS TO EXAMINE. PROJECTS IN THAT AREA THAT WE CONCEIVED TO BE NEXT IN LINE FOR. IMPLEMENTATION AS FELLOW BRUCE WILCOX MENTION THERE IS A TASK ORDER THAT IS. HAS BEEN. RELEASED TO DO FURTHER DEFINE THAT PROJECTS WOULD CONFORM TO THE STATE CRITERIA. BUT IT ALSO WILL MEET ADDITIONAL OF MULTIPLE DELIVERED BENEFITS OR LOOKING FOR IN TERMS OF RECREATION ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY WE THINK WE CAN DO ALL OF THOSE. IF WE INTEGRATE THOSE MULTIPLE BENEFITS IN A WAY THAT CREATES DEEPWATER HABITAT. YOU WON'T FIND ANYWHERE ELSE AROUND THE CITY TO HIGH PRIORITY WE'VE GOT TO GET THAT DONE. AS WELL AS PROTECTING THE COMMUNITIES AND PERHAPS BUILDING SOME ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THAT CREATES A FINANCIAL TO WE WOULDN'T HAVE OTHERWISE I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WORK IN A CLOSELY WITH MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY I. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY. THAT THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE. TO SOME EXTENT YEAR THAT SAYS SEEMS TO BE A MISSING PIECE. MOVING FORWARD. AB MY COLLEAGUES ARE ARE CORRECTED THERE HAS BEEN MORE OF A TOP DOWN APPROACH AND IF BEN PROJECT FOCUSED. OF THE STATE HAS FOCUSED ON EXPLAINING HIS TEN YEAR PLAN TO THE PUBLIC. AND. I THINK THE. THE STATE HAS BEEN A FORTHRIGHT IN AND ACKNOWLEDGING THIS IS PROBABLY NOT THE IDEAL WAY TO APPROACH THIS. AND THEY MADE ADJUSTMENTS THEY HAVE ACCOMMODATED. UNDER MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION CHANGING THE NAME OF THAT. PARTICULAR ADVISORY COMMITTEE FROM OUTREACH COMMITTEE TO COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT COMMITTEE. I THINK THAT'S AN INDICATION OF THAT CHANGING STANCE AND FOCUS THAT. I THINK IS IT BEING ACKNOWLEDGED AND LARGELY TO THE. OF SUGGESTIONS OF OF OUR CULTURE TO STABLE MY HOPE IS THAT YOU KNOW ABOUT. THERE ARE SOME SCHEDULED. A ACTIVITIES THAT TO BEGIN A MUCH MORE THOROUGH ENGAGEMENT YOU KNOW COMING FORWARD AND. THE BENCHMARKS THAT NEED TO BE SAID ALONG WITH THE TIME LINES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT ON THE PREVIOUS. A PANEL. UP CAN YOU TOUCH A LITTLE BIT ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S COMPLY I KNOW WE'VE HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE POSSIBILITIES OF FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES THERE. ARE I THINK THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AND THAT. THAT WAS RAISED EARLY ON WITH THE LA OFFICE AND MAYBE YOU CAN KIND OF FAMOUS A PICTURE OF ONE OF THE ACTION STEPS THAT WE NEED TO BE PURSUING WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN IT IT DID BEARS MENTIONED THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OWNS ABOUT FORTY PERCENT OF THE REAL ESTATE IN AROUND THE CITY. THEY HAVE SIGNED A AND M. O. U. WITH THE SALT SEA AUTHORITY THIS IS THE PART OF A TERROR ATTACK ABOUT. AS WELL AS A OF THE VERY SIMILAR AMMO YOU WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT RESOURCES AGENCY. THEY PLEDGE TO COOPERATE. IN AND SHARE INFORMATION AND HAVE MORE OF A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH AN INTER AGENCY. COOPERATIVE APPROACH WE HAVE YET TO SEE ANY OF THE AGENCIES TAKE LEAD ON THAT. THEY HAVE NOT ALL ALSO OF MY COLLEAGUE BRUCE WILCOX MENTION THEY HAVE NOT YET BEEN. ABLE TO LIVE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS NOT COMMITTED TO FUNDING THAT THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR COMMITMENT AND THE AMMO YOU FOR A LONG TERM. O. THEY'LL. BUT WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE AT LEAST ON IN THE SHORT TERM AS A. A LEADERSHIP ROLE FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT DEPARTMENT INTERIOR SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE AND PERHAPS OF BARACK IMATION SINCE THEY OWN A LOT OF THE LAND AROUND THERE AND THEY ARE ENGAGED. WOULD BE ONE OF THOSE AGENCIES THAT WE THINK COULD BRING TOGETHER THE FEDERAL FAMILY AND THEY COULD SERVE AS POINT. TO HAVE MORE OF IT INTEGRATED FEDERAL WORK GROUP THAT CAN THEN WORK WHAT THE STATE AND LOCALS THAT WOULD HELP SPEED THINGS UP WE THINK THAT'S ONE WAY WE CAN GAIN. OF SOME AT GROUND ON AT AND SOME. RECOVER SOME LOST TIME EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY SIMPLY HAVING THAT LEVEL COOPERATION CAN HELP EXPEDITE PERMITTING PROCESS SEES AND CAN HELP COORDINATE. THE KIND OF FEDERAL PLANNING THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF THAT. ON THE FUNDING SIDE. STATE AND COOPERATE WITH THE SOLVE SEE AUTHORITY HAS EXAMINED POTS OF MONEY. THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. IN ORDER TO SPEND THAT MONEY. THE. APART RAG REQUIRES A NEW. FEASIBILITY PLAN FOR OUR WATERSHED. AND. THE SAME KIND OF REQUIREMENT IS SO EXPECTED FROM THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS. BY THE WAY THE SALT SEA THOR PREFERRED NOT FEDERAL PARTNER. FLORA CONTRACT WITH THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS IN THE WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT. POLLS. ARMY CORPS AND USDA AND CONCEIVABLY <u>&lt;c.green&gt; PI.</u> SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS FOR A FEASIBILITY STUDY ON WATERSHED SCALE. WHAT SHOULD WE DO THREE OF THESE? EXPENSIVE TIME CONSUMING STUDIES ONE WE THANK ONE SHOULD SUFFICE AND WE HAVE A BLUEPRINT ALREADY ON THE GROUND. WE THINK THE SALT SEA MANAGER PLAN SERVES AS A BASIS FOR THAT. THAT'S A AREA WHERE WE COULD SAVE A LOT OF TIME A LOT OF MONEY AND IF WE HAVE A CONSOLIDATED INTEGRATED APPROACH. WHERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN ACKNOWLEDGE? AND INCORPORATE THE SALTY MANTRA PLANET WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN FROM WATERSHED FEASIBILITY PIECE. NOW WE'VE GAINED SOME TIME WE'VE SAVED A LOT OF MONEY AND WE'VE ALSO ESTABLISHED A WAY TO BRING DOWN FEDERAL MONEY. THAT THE ARMY CORPS AT THE USDA. AT EPA THAT CAN REINFORCE WHAT WE NEED TO DO IT THE STATE AND THE LOCAL LEVELS AND NOW WE HAVE A PLAN. THAT ACTUALLY WORKS FOR EVERYBODY. MAKE YOUR GOING TO WRITTEN DOWN SOME OF THE STEPS I KNOW THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET TOGETHER. IN THE COMING. WEEKS WITH OUR OWN CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVE. AND DE. TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS IN A BLUE PRINTER MAP THAT YOU SPOKEN UP. SO THAT COLLECTIVELY RIGHT THAT SO THAT WE CAN SUPPORT OUR LOCAL. CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVE IN THE EFFORTS IN WASHINGTON DC AS AS A STATE DELEGATION. ARM TO REALLY HOLD. THIS ADMINISTRATION AND THOSE AGENCIES LAMAR COUNTABLE. TO TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT IS THAT FORTY PERCENT IF WE CAN CALL IT YOU KNOW A PART OF THAT RESPONSIBILITY THAT THEY HAVE. I WANT TO THANK YOU OF BOARDMAN MEMORY BY MY VET TO CHECK THINGS LOOKS APOLOGIZE FIRST BEGAN TO TURN HERE BUT. I THINK IT WOULD BE ROOM HAS CITED MENTIONED BUT THEY'RE JUST THREE CRAIG ELEMENTS I THINK THEY'RE IMPORTANT. AND ONE IS THAT RESEARCH PRIOR TO THE LAST. FIGHTERS WOULD SAY I DID NOT HAVE A STRONG COMPONENT COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION AND I BELIEVE THAT THAT'S HAS CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY. ARE THE OTHER IS THAT DE CALL WE. OUTREACH AND EDUCATION AND ENGAGEMENT PROJECT THAT WE PUT TOGETHER HAT. I A COMMUNITY ADVISORY THAT HELPED DEVELOP. THAT AND I BELIEVE THAT ANY FUTURE EDUCATION ENGAGEMENT TYPE OF PROJECTS. ARE AND I THINK THAT SUPPORTS WHAT FLEW PAST. HAS A STRONG ELEMENT I IN AND BELIEVE THAT THAT THE OF THE FISCAL. OUR CONVERSATION ALSO WAS BROUGHT ABOUT I THINK THAT'S KEY AND THIRD WHICH IS THE MOST CRITICAL OF AYE. IF THE QUESTION WAS ASKED WHAT HAVE WE SEEN THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ENGAGEMENT IT'S IN THE YOUTH ENGAGEMENT AND WE'VE BEEN FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BRING THESE YOUTH. ADHERE TO THE TO THE TO THE LEGISLATURE WE'VE MET WOULD SEND A MOTHER THAT SHE IS WAS. THEN DAWN BUT THE YOUTH ENGAGEMENT THE ENGAGEMENT THAT'S HAPPENING AT THE SCHOOLS I WOULD SAY IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT MOST PROMISING ENGAGEMENT THAT WE HAVE SEEN. BECAUSE A LOT OF THE STUDENTS WHO CAME OUT HERE SLIM BACK IN ST I'M SURE THAT. POLITICS IS WHAT I WANT TO PURSUE I'M SURE THAT SCIENCE AND AND AND AND ANOTHER. ACADEMIC TYPES OF. OF CAREER GOALS IS THAT THEY WANT TO PURSUE SERGEANT EMPHASIZE HOW IMPORTANT. DO YOU THINK AGE MEN ENVIRONMENT LITERACY CIVIC LITERACY AT SCHOOL LEVEL AT THE HIGH SCHOOLS HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS AND IT'S BEEN YIELDING SIGNIFICANT. OF. THE PROGRESS IN OUR REGION. THANK YOU SO MATTER ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU TO ALL THE PRESENTERS HAVE BOTH YOURSELF THAT THOSE ON PANEL TO. I THINK THAT WE CAN COME TO CONCLUDE HERE WE WILL HAVE SOME PUBLIC COMMENTS BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY I THINK A COUPLE OF TAKE AWAYS IS THAT WE ARE GOING TO GET. SOME. ACTION PLAN HAVE BY JUNE. TO HIGHLIGHT HOW WE GET BACK ON TRACK. TO MEETING THE OBJECTIVES OF THE MANAGEMENT PLAN. OH WE HEARD THE DEPARTMENT SAY THAT BY DECEMBER. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IS WHEN WE WILL. VERY LIKELY BEGIN THE. S. THE C. H. PROJECT RIGHT THE A SPECIES CONSERVATION HABITAT PROJECT. AND THAT. WE ARE VERY CLOSE TO ADDRESSING THE EASEMENT ISSUES. THAT HAVE BEEN HOLDING UP THE BEGINNING OF THAT. WE. HIGHLIGHTED THE ISSUES OF. ONGOING. INCREASE OF STAFFING AND CAPACITY THAT YOU KNOW WE BELIEVE COULD POTENTIALLY HELP MOVE. THESE. PROJECTS AND PROCESS FORWARD. AND THEN LASTLY YOU KNOW I I HIGHLIGHTED IN I I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT FOLKS. WOULD DISAGREE THAT WE WANT THIS PROJECT. TO RISE TO THE LEVEL LOVE PRIORITY AND IMPORTANCE AS A PROJECT LIKE THE OROVILLE DAM PROJECT AND HOW WE RESPONDED TO THAT EMERGENCY. CONSIDERING THE. PUBLIC HEALTH IMPLICATIONS THAT WE HEARD DOCTOR. LOW EXPLAIN TO US. ARE YOU. A CRITICAL AND SO I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE WHO PARTICIPATED AND HOPE THAT THE YOU TO WALK AWAY WITH SOME OF THESE TAKE AWAYS AND FOLLOW UPS THAT WILL TAKE PLACE. OUR STAFF WILL BE ENGAGE WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY. AS I MENTIONED I USED THE WORD INTIMATELY. YOU KNOW FOLLOWING EXACTLY THE PROGRESS OR LACK OF. AND DATA AT THE SAME TIME BEGIN SCHEDULING. A YEAH HEARING OF THIS SORT IN THE DISTRICT SO THAT OUR COMMUNITY FOLKS CAN PARTICIPATE DIRECTLY NOT VIA FACEBOOK OR NOT VIA A STREAMLINED SESSION I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HEAR. FROM THEM AS WELL. NSULT AGAIN THANK YOU FOR PARTICIPATINGWE APPRECIATE THAT YOU. PROVIDING TESTIMONY TODAY AND THOSE WHO ARE HERE. WITNESS SCENE I WILL NOW OPEN THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD AYE IF YOU WOULD DUH PLEASE BE SO KIND AS TO. GET THE UP PUBLIC COMMENT SAID GOING IN. KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO NAME OUR ORGANIZATION AND OF JUST A VERY BRIEF AS WE HAVE OTHER FOLKS THAT ARE NEEDING TO USE THIS ROOM VERY SOON. SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MY NAME'S MIKE LINES OF THE DIRECTOR OF POLICY FOR OUT OF ON CALIFORNIA WHICH HAS BEEN ENGAGED THE SALTON SEA FOR MANY YEARS. I FOR FIVE THANK YOU FOR THE OVERSIGHT HEARING I THINK WE LEARNED A LOT OF USEFUL INFORMATION AND HOPEFULLY GET SOME PROGRESS TO GO FORWARD. I THINK. HAD THE SUPERION FRANKLY IS YEAH. EMPHASIZE A DEGREE OF FRUSTRATION I THINK AND AND MAYBE ADDED SOME OF THAT FRUSTRATION TODAY I THINK EVERYBODY WORKING ON THIS IS WORKING HARD BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A BETTER PROGRAM PUT IN PLACE MY HOPE IS THAT THIS CAN BE ELEVATED NOT ONLY THE LEGISLATURE. BUT FOR THE INCOMING GOVERNOR TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT PERSON KNOWS THAT THIS IS A PRIORITY AND THAT WE GET A SECURE A PROMISE FROM THAT PERSON IF THEY WILL ELEVATED AND MAKE SURE THAT IT'S ADEQUATELY STAFFED AS WELL AS ADEQUATELY FUNDED. I DO ALSO WANT TO KNOW THAT WE HAVE BEEN HEARING FOR YEARS THE PROMISES OF PROGRESS AND SO WHILE I. ADMIRE EVERYBODY THAT SPOKE TODAY THE PROMISE THAT WE WILL SEE A PROJECTS START IN DECEMBER. CONTINUES TO RING HOLLOW SPEECHES CONSERVATION HABITAT HAS BEEN UNDER DEVELOPMENT FOR EIGHT YEARS RED HILL BAY SOMETHING LIKE SIX YEARS ANNOUNCED THE FEDERAL PROJECT THE TORCH MARTINEZ PROJECT I THINK IT'S WORTHY TO POINT OUT HAS MADE SOME REALLY GREAT PROGRESS AND I THINK A LOT OF PREDICADORES AUNTIE OF. THORNY FOR MAKING THAT HAPPEN MANY CONTINUED SUPPORT TO MAKE SHORT SUCCESSFUL BUT I THINK THE PROMISED NOTHING HAPPENS OF THE SALTON SEA AND TELL IT'S ACTUALLY DONE. AND THE LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE ON THE DELAYS. IS REALLY THAT WHILE I'M HOPING THAT THESE ISSUES WITH THE EASEMENT WILL WILL SET SOME PRECEDENTS LITTLE PAVE THE WAY FOR FUTURE PROJECTS. I THINK WE SHOULD ANTICIPATE AND EXPECT ADDITIONAL DELAYS ON A PROJECT BY PROJECT BASIS AND THE ONLY WAY THAT GETS DEALT WITH IS MAKING SURE THAT BRUCE AND WHO'S EVER IN CHARGE OF THE PROJECT HAS AN ADEQUATE STAFF THAT THEY CAN TELL TO ATTENDED A PROGRAM. AND THERE ARE CERTAIN ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONSEQUENCES IF IT'S NOT. AND THAT NEEDS TO BE FOR ALL STAKEHOLDERS WEATHERS. I USED TO MAKE SURE REAL PROGRESS IS BEING MADE TO PROTECT THE COMMUNITIES TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT. THANK YOU. AND GOOD AFTERNOON THAT CAN DELFINO THE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM DIRECTOR DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE AND I THINK THAT. MIKE LINES IS PROBABLY VERY. ADEPTLY ADEPTLY EXPRESSED PROLLY THE. THANK THANKFULNESS FOR HAVING THE HEARING BUT ALSO SOME OF THE FRUSTRATION WITH SOME OF THE RESPONSES THAT WE HAD IN A AND ALSO BE THANKFUL FOR THE QUESTIONS THAT FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS RIGHT. SOLDIERS MAKE THIS QUICKLY. I THINK THAT. YOU'VE ADDED YOU'VE POINTED OUT I THINK IT'S RIGHT. THE NEXT ACTION PLAN WHICH BY THE WAY WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF PLAN SO KIND OF ONE OF YOU TO THAT PROGRESS THE ACTUAL PROJECT PART BUT THE NEXT PLAN THAT YOU SEE. AT THE END OF JUNE I THINK NEEDS TO VERY CLEARLY HAVE TO HAVE. A MORE DETAILED EXPLANATION ON IF THERE'S ANY FURTHER ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO EASEMENTS. ANY PERMUTATIONS IN THOSE ISSUES THAT THEY MIGHT SEE AND HOW THEY'RE GOING TO STAFF THAT. ON IN THE FUTURE OF WHAT'S GOING ON WITH DESIGN BUILD. SOMETHING THAT HAD AUTHORITY FOR FRANKLY FOR TWO YEARS AND THE FACT THAT THEY JUST HAVE SOMEONE STAFFED ON THE LAST THREE WEEKS THAT'S LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE AND HOW THEY'RE MOVING FORWARD WITH THAT. THE STAFFING AND RE ADDITIONAL STAFFING AND RESOURCES THAT FINALLY. THERE WAS SOME OF THROUGH TOUGH QUESTIONING I THINK FROM BOTH YOU AND. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO ON THE FACT THAT THEY NEED ADDITIONAL STAFFING WHERE DID THEY NEED ADDITIONAL STAFFING AND WHAT IF THEY NEED TO DO IN TERMS OF MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE TO MAKE THIS WORK BETTER AND HAVE MORE ACCOUNTABILITY. A ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS AND I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE IN THEIR NEXT REPORT AND ALSO A SPECIFIC TIMELINE. AND. OUTCOMES. IT IT'S A GAP CHART PERHAPS OF WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE DOING WITH RESPECT TO EACH ONE OF THE PROJECT THAT THEY'VE LISTED BECAUSE WE'VE HEARD THESE PROJECTS IT THERE'S BEEN A COUPLE NEW ONES THAT WERE ADDED BUT. OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND I THINK MISTER LINES MADE AN EXCELLENT POINT IN THAT. WE'VE ALWAYS WE'VE BEEN TOLD CONSISTENTLY. NEXT JUNE NEXT DECEMBER WILL BREAK GROUND NEXT WHENEVER AND IT HAS NOT YET HAPPENED AND I THINK THEY NEED TO ARE REALLY CLEARLY SPELL OUT A TIMELINE AND WHAT IT IS THAT THEY NEED TO BE DOING. TO MEET THAT TIMELINE THAT THEY'RE SETTING OUT AND IF THERE'S ENOUGH THERE ISN'T AN ABILITY TO MEET THEIR TIMELINE. YOU KNOW IN THE TIME THAT THEY. YEP OF FOR TODAY HOW WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO ABOUT THAT. SO AND IF THAT'S NOT IN THE OF PLAN THAT YOU GET ON AT THE END OF JUNE THEN THAT'S THOSE SHOULD BE THE TOPIC THAT YOU RAISE IN THE HEARING. ON THAT YOU HAVE DOWN IN THE. IN THE SONGS THE AREA WHICH ARE VERY THANKFUL THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE ADDITIONAL COMMUNITY GAUGES AND I GUESS THAT THE THE OTHER THING I WOULD ADD. TO THEIR STAFFING AND IS WHAT ARE THEY DOING ABOUT INCREASE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE STAFFING TO DO IT WHAT'D THEY NEED IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT INCREASE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. AND HOW COULD THEY POTENTIALLY PARTNER WITH OTHERS LIKE THE FOLKS THAT YOU HAD HERE ON THIS LAST PANEL TO MAYBE EXPAND THAT COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. SO THAT WOULD BE MY RECOMMENDATIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN. MY NAME'S INTER FOLLAND I I'M WITH THAT I'M SENIOR PROGRAM OFFICER FOR THE WATER FOUNDATION. WE SPONSORED LAST YEAR'S YOU'LL RECALL A TOUR OF THE SALTON SEA AMONG FOLKS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION LEGISLATURE. AND. WE ARE REPRESENTS A LARGER COLLABORATION AND PHILANTHROPIES A AROUND THE STATE THAT ARE INTERESTED IN IN TRYING TO ADDRESS AND SOLVE. THESE REALLY DAUNTING PROBLEMS. I'D I JUST WANTED TO MAKE GUY OF ONE REMARK. ABOUT AND AFTER IT THAT WE'VE UNDERTAKEN TO ON ANALYSTS AT OUTSIDE SUPPORT FROM A CONSULTING FIRM TO TO TRY TO. REALLY TACKLE THIS CHALLENGE OF MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE AND. AND GOVERNANCE AND WHERE WE'RE GOING TO GO OUT WITH A SONG AND SEE PROGRAM THAT HAS.
