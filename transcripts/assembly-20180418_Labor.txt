YES YES BUT I APPLAUD THE TO EXPEDIENCY CLASS YES THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR STORY OUR NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. SHOULD I TRANSLATE THE LAST PIECE SHE SAID. I CAME HERE TODAY TO BE PROACTIVE IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MY RIGHTS I WANT DIGNITY AND RESPECT FOR MY WORK FOR MY RIGHTS AND THAT THE EMPLOYER THE SYSTEM AND THE BROADER COMMUNITY SUPPORT THIS PROFESSION. IT'S FOR THESE REASONS THAT I ASK YOU TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF A. B. 23-14 FOR WORK FOR DIGNITY THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO ME. IF YOU NEXT WILL ASK. MY NAME IS MICKEY BROWN BOOKER. AND I'M A MEMBER OF A HAND IN HAND THAT THE MEXICAN PLAYERS NETWORK. I HAVE A DISABILITY ALL MY LIFE AND I RELIANT PERSONAL CARE ATTENDANTS FOR CARE. I STARTED HIRING AND EMPLOYING ATTENDANTS WHEN I LEFT MY PARENT'S HOUSE AT THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN TO GO TO COLLEGE. I NOW AM POINT SIX ATTENDANCE ON A REGULAR BASIS. AND THEY HELP ME TO THINGS LIKE GETTING ME IN AND OUT OF BED PREPARING MY MEALS DOING MY LAUNDRY AND DRIVING INTO WORK. USING ATTENDANT CARE SERVICES HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR ME TO BECOME AN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. OF A NONPROFIT THAT SERVES PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. THE NEED FOR EDUCATION ON DOMESTIC EMPLOYMENT IS GREAT AND GROWLING. ONE NEARLY TWO MILLION HOUSEHOLDS WHO CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY RELY ON DOMESTIC WORKERS. THAT NUMBER IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE BY AT LEAST FIFTY TWO PERCENT BY THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWO. DUE TO THE UNPRECEDENTED COUNTERPLAN WE ARE EXPERIENCING IN THE UNITED STATES. AS THE FOR HOME CARE RISES. SO DOES THE URGENCY TRIP SHORING THAT WORKERS CAN ACCESS QUALITY CARE GIVING JOBS. THAT PROVIDE MUTUAL DIGNITY WITH CLEAR GUIDANCE ON LABOR LAWS. GOVERNING THE SECTOR FOR BOTH WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS. CURRENTLY THAT GUIDANCE IS HARD TO FIND. WHEN I FIRST BECAME AN EMPLOYER AT AGE EIGHTEEN I HAD NO IDEA OF THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS AROUND I'M FLYING A DOMESTIC WORKER. I HAD TO FIGURE IT OUT ON MY OWN. AND I WAS FRUSTRATED WITH HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS TO FIND ANY INFORMATION. ON HOW TO BE A RESPONSIBLE DOMESTIC REQUIRE OF A CAREGIVER. AND I WANT TO BE AGAIN EMPLOYER. IN MY JOB AND AS A TRAINER WITH HAND IN HAND GIVING WORKSHOPS TO NEW ATTEND AND INQUIRES. I HOW TO BE A FAIR DOMESTIC EMPLOYER. I WORKED WITH PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND SENIORS THAT HAVE HAD THE SAME QUESTIONS THAT I DID. MANY OF THEM EMPLOYEE CARE URANUS EVERYDAY. BERNARD CHALLENGE BECAUSE THEY ALSO DO NOT KNOW THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS AROUND DOMESTIC WORK. MOST EMPLOYERS LIKE ME VALUED THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT DOMESTIC WORKERS MAKE SURE THEIR HOMES AND LIVES. BUT DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES AND TOOLS TO IN OUR CURRENT RESPONSIBILITIES AND TO BE AN AFFAIR EMPLOYERS. AB TO 23-14 WOULD CHANGE THAT BY CREATING A CENTRALIZED PLACE TO FIND RELEVANT INFORMATION. AND IT WOULD CREATE A PROGRAM OF EDUCATION TO REACH THE GROWING POPULATION OF EMPLOYERS. TO EMPOWER THEM TWO HUNDRED STAND THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES. AND UPHOLD FAIR PRACTICES IN THEIR HOMES. PLEASE SUPPORT AB 23-14 IT IS VITAL TO BRING RESPECT FAIRNESS AND DIGNITY TO DOMESTIC WORK SO BOTH WORKER AND EMPLOYER ARE SUPPORTED. THINKING.

THANK YOU EVERYONE NBI IT'S IN THE IN AB TWENTY SIX THIRTEEN ONE OTHER ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY WE WILL NOT BE HEARING AB TWENTY FIVE OR NINE BY WALDRON. THAT BILL HAS BEEN COOL BY THE REQUEST OF THE AUTHOR IF YOU'RE HERE FOR AB TWENTY FIVE OR NINE WALDRON. WE WILL NOT BE HEARING THAT BILL. SOME IN MEMORY AS WE ARE READY WHEN YOU. ALSO ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT WE WILL BE JOINED IN THE COMMITTEE JUST FOR TODAY BY SOME REMEMBER MATHIS. WHO FOR JUST TODAY WILL BE REPLACING ASSEMBLY MEMBER MELENDEZ? CHAIR PIKE AND BEGIN WITH. EIGHTEEN SEVENTY. PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. TODAY I PRESENT TO YOU A. B. EIGHTEEN SEVENTIES THE SHARE ACT. THE STOP HARASSMENT AND REPORTING EXTENSION ACT. STANDS OF TIME FOR FILING HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT FIEGER. CURRENTLY A HARASSMENT VICTIM MUST FILE A CLAIM WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING. WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE UNLAWFUL ACT OR THE FACE AN ABSOLUTE TIME BAR AND WILL BE UNABLE TO SEEK ADMINISTRATIVE OR CIVIL REMEDIES. IN COURT. THIS BILL WOULD EXTEND THIS FILING REQUIREMENT FROM ONE YEAR TO THREE YEARS ALLOWING VICTIMS ADDITIONAL TIME TO SEEK REDRESS. AND MAKING IT MORE CONSISTENT WITH THE FILING TIMES FOR OTHER ACTIONS. THE CALIFORNIA FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING ACT IS DESIGNED TO PROTECT EMPLOYEES FROM WORKPLACE HARASSMENT. SCREAMING NATION. RETALIATION. AND PROVIDE DUE PROCESS. TO PROTECT CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS SEX AND GENDER SEXUAL ORIENTATION GENDER IDENTITY RACE AGE RELIGION DISABILITY AND MORE. THE LEGISLATURE LIKE SO MANY INDUSTRIES HAS BEEN GRAPPLING WITH THE CHANGES IN THE WAKE OF THE ME TOO MOVEMENT. PARTICULARLY AFTER THE SEXUAL MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS AGAINST MEMBERS OF OUR OWN BODY. HOWEVER THESE ISSUES ARE NOT LIMITED TO THE HALLS OF GOVERNMENT. THROUGH THE STORIES WE'RE HAVING A LARGER SOCIETY Y. DIALOGUE ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND THE EVIDENCE IS THERE. ONE YEAR IS SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH TIME TO BRING HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS FORWARD. WORKPLACE HARASSMENT CREATES INTIMIDATING HOW STYLE DEGRADING HUMILIATING. OFFENSIVE ENVIRONMENT. THESE ACTIONS WREAK HAVOC ON ITS VICTIMS. AND CAN CAUSE LASTING EFFECTS PHYSICALLY MENTALLY AND EMOTIONALLY. WE CANNOT LET THE FEAR OF RETALIATION OF THE PSYCHOLOGICAL WOUNDS BECAUSE BY SUCH ACTIONS TO PREVENT VICTIMS FROM SEEKING JUSTICE. IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT MOST OTHER TYPES OF HARM HAVE LONGER FILING DEADLINES FOR EXAMPLE THE TIME. FOR FILING AN ACTION FOR PERSONAL INJURY IN CALIFORNIA IS TWO YEARS. ACTIONS FOR FRAUD OR THREE YEARS IN CONTRACT DISPUTES OR FOUR YEARS. IT IS CLEAR THAT OUR SOCIETY NEEDS A LARGER EVALUATION CONCERNING THE TREATMENT OF OUR EMPLOYEES WHEN IT COMES TO HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION IN THE WORKPLACE. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. BRITNEY MCCARTHY WOULD WORK EQUITY AND JESSICA STANDER WITH EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES. RENDON. I CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME MY NAME IS JESSICA STENDER I'M SENIOR COUNSEL FOR WORKPLACE JUSTICE AND PUBLIC POLICY WITH EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES. OUR MISSION IS TO PROTECT EXPAND OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS AND FOR OVER FORTY YEARS WEAVER BUT PROVIDED LEGAL REPRESENTATION ADVISING COUNSELING TO WOMEN AND MEN WHO EXPERIENCE SEXUAL HARASSMENT. AND OTHER FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION IN THE WORKPLACE WHERE PROUD TO CO SPONSOR AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY WHAT WILL EXTEND THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR FILING CLAIMS UNDER THE FEE HA. VICTIMS OF SEXUAL RESIDENT PHASE MERIAN OBSTACLES TO FILING A CLAIM WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THEIR HARASSMENT THEY OFTEN DON'T IMMEDIATELY COME FORWARD BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID OF RETALIATION BY THE HARASSER THEIR EMPLOYER WHICH COULD RESULT IN ADVERSE EMPLOYMENT ACTIONS INCLUDING UP TO. A TERMINATION SOME VICTIMS FEEL TO COME FOR DUE TO THE TRAUMA THEY'VE EXPERIENCED OR BECAUSE THEY DON'T BELIEVE THEY WON'T BELIEVE BE BELIEVED. AND ESPECIALLY VICTIMS WERE IN LOW WAGE INDUSTRIES FARMWORKERS JANITORIAL WORKERS OF THESE OF TENS OF UP OF WORKERS THAT WE REPRESENT ARE OFTEN VERY SCARED BUT OFTEN DON'T EVEN KNOW THEIR RIGHTS AND DON'T KNOW THAT WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM IS UNLAWFUL. AND BY THE TIME THEY FIND OUT THAT THE BEHAVIOR THAT THEY EXPERIENCED IS ILLEGAL THEY'VE OFTEN PAST THEIR ONE YOU'RE SUCH A LIMITATION THAT HAVE LOST THEIR RIGHT TO BRING A CLAIM. UPS WE BELIEVE THE STATUE LIMITATION SHOULD BE EXTENDED A WE BELIEVE THIS IS THE RESULT OF TIME TO GIVE VICTIMS AT THE TIME THEY NEED UP TO BRING THEIR CLAIMS AND WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL AND ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK MY NAME IS PRETTY MCCARTHY AND I AM HERE TO GIVE A STRONGER VOICE TO THE MANY WOMEN AND MEN WHO HAVE COURAGEOUSLY COME FORWARD WITH THEIR ME TWO STORIES. ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT THEY ARE UNABLE TO SEEK ASSISTANCE FROM THE JUSTICE SYSTEM OR HOLD THEIR PERPETRATORS ACCOUNTABLE BECAUSE THEY MISS THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS DEADLINE. MY STORY INVOLVES FILM DIRECTOR JAMES TOE BACK. I AM ONE OF THE NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED WOMEN WHO HAVE COME FORWARD TO SHARE THEIR STORIES OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT PERPETRATED BY HIM. LAST OCTOBER MY PHONE BUZZED WITH THE NEWS NOTIFICATION THIRTY EIGHT WOMEN HAVE COME FORWARD TO ACCUSE DIRECTOR JAMES TAILBACK OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. A WAVE OF SHAME CAME OVER ME AND I FELT A PUNCH TO THE GUT AS MEMORIES OF MY OWN ENCOUNTER WITH JAMES HER BACK CAME FLOODING BACK. A COMBINATION OF CONFUSION AND SHAME HAD STUFF THIS EXPERIENCE DOWN FOR NINE YEARS. AFTER READING IN THE NEWS REPORT THE TOE BACK HAD ACCUSED THE WOMEN OF BEING LIARS I EMAILED THE REPORTER AND TOLD HIM THAT I KNEW THAT WOMEN WEREN'T LYING. BECAUSE THE SAME THING HAD HAPPENED TO ME. I THEN DECIDED TO FILE A POLICE REPORT WITH THE LAPD AND THE BEVERLY HILLS POLICE DEPARTMENT. THIS PAST SPRING THE LOS ANGELES CA INTERVIEWED ME AS PART OF THEIR INVESTIGATIONS INTO TOE BACK. BRETT RATNER AND HARVEY WEINSTEIN. WHAT HAPPENS TO ME IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT WHICH WAS REPORTED IN THE LA TIMES IN NOVEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN? WAS SOMETHING I HAD CHALKED UP TO WEIRD HOLLYWOOD EXPERIENCE I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS A REPORTABLE OFFENSE OR EVEN PROTECTED UNDER OUR SEXUAL HARASSMENT LAWS. SO BACK APPROACH ME BECAUSE HE WANTED TO HIRE ME TO BE IN HIS UPCOMING FILM. I BELIEVE THERE IS BEING CONSIDERED FOR A JOB. AND HE USE THAT POWER OVER ME TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ME AND TO SEXUALLY ASSAULT ME. WHAT HE DID WAS UNLAWFUL UNDER THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT WHICH NOT ONLY PROTECTS EMPLOYEES IT ALSO PROTECTS APPLICANTS FROM SEXUAL HARASSMENT? I'M SURE THAT'S HOW ABOUT HAS SEXUALLY HARASSED MANY OTHER APPLICANTS JUST LIKE ME. AND MANY OTHER EMPLOYEES THAT HE HAS WORKED WITH ON FILM PRODUCTIONS. HOWEVER THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR EMPLOYEES AND APPLICANTS WITH SEXUAL HARASSMENT HARASSMENT CLAIMS IS ONLY ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF THE UNLAWFUL CONDUCT. ONE YEAR IS FAR TOO SHORT OF A TIME PERIOD FOR THESE KINDS OF EXPERIENCES. EXTENDING TO THREE YEARS WOULD ALLOW VICTIMS TO PROCESS THEIR EXPERIENCE AND MAKE THE BEST DECISION FOR HOW TO MOVE FORWARD BEFORE THE TIME TO FILE EXPIRES. A PERSON WHO HAS EXPERIENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT OR SEXUAL HARASSMENT MAY NOT EVEN KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM IS UNLAWFUL REPORTABLE. THEY MAY NOT KNOW WHO TO GO TO. THEY MAY NOT TALK ABOUT IT FOR A LONG TIME TO FRIENDS OR FAMILY OR COLLEAGUES BECAUSE THEY ARE EMBARRASSED OR SCARED. THEIR SILENCE KEEP THEM ISOLATED AND WITHOUT SOMEONE SAYING HEY. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU WAS WRONG IT'S REPORTABLE AND AGAINST THE LAW? THEY MAY NEVER FEEL COMFORTABLE COMING FORWARD. THEIR LIVELIHOODS ARE AT STAKE THEIR REPUTATION THEIR RELATIONSHIPS THEIR SELF ESTEEM THEIR WELL BEING THEY MAY BE AFRAID OF BEING BELIEVES ARE NOT WANT TO GO THROUGH THE WHOLE PROCESS OF BEING AN ACCUSER. WE ALL HAVE HEARD THE RESPONSES TO WILL COME FORWARD SHE JUST WANTS TO PAY OUT. SHE JUST WANTS ATTENTION WHAT WAS SHE DOING GOING TO DINNER WITH HIM WHAT DID SHE EXPECT TO HAVE HAPPEN. WHEN PEOPLE HAVE THESE EXPERIENCES WE DON'T REALIZE ARE FULLY UNDERSTAND THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AFFECTS THE PREVENT PEOPLE FROM COMING FORWARD. EMBARASSMENT SHAME INTERNALIZE VICTIM BLAMING. MY WIFE COMING FORWARD HAS BEEN SCARY ON CERTAIN UNCOMFORTABLE AND NOT NECESSARILY A SUPPORTIVE EXPERIENCE. I EVEN WONDER WHAT YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT ME AS I SIT HERE NOW AND SHARE MY STORY. I WONDER IF YOU QUESTION MY MOTIVES MY EXPERIENCE WHETHER I AM TELLING THE TRUTH WHAT AGENDA YOU THINK I MAY HAVE. THE EXPERIENCE OF AN ACCUSER CAN BE ISOLATING AND CONFUSING. WHY THE DA SEEMED VERY INTERESTED IN INTERVIEWING ME FOR THEIR CASE AND SAID THEY WOULD FOLLOW UP WITH ME? I FOUND OUT THAT THE D. A WOULD BE DROPPING THE INVESTIGATION INTO HER BACK BECAUSE OF THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS WHICH IS SIMILARLY TOO SHORT FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT BY READING IT IN THE NEWSPAPER. PLEASE SUPPORT AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY AND THANK YOU FOR INTRODUCING AT. AND LENGTHENING THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIMS SO THAT MORE VICTIMS CAN SEEK JUSTICE WHEN THEY'RE READY TO COME FORWARD. HOWTO BACK BEEN STOPPED BEFORE OR AFTER MY OWN ENCOUNTER FEWER WOMEN WOULD HAVE BEEN ASSAULTED AND HARASSED BY HIM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY THIS COMMITTEE WELCOMES YOU AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU THANK YOU. OTHERS WISHING TO ADD ON. IN SUPPORT I'D NAME AFFILIATION AND POSITION.

AND WE A WORKER CENTERS THAT WORK WITH LOW WAGE RESTAURANT WORKERS ONLY STRONG SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU. MARK CHARTER CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION ALSO SUPPORT THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE ANYONE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. PLEASE COME FORWARD. HI GOOD MORNING LARA CURTIS WITH CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THANK YOU SO MUCH CHAIRMAN AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY WE ARE HERE ON AN OPPOSING LOS AMENDED POSITION. TO EIGHTEEN SEVENTY BECAUSE OUR MEMBERS FEEL THAT IF THE EMPLOYERS DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON THERE'S NO ABILITY FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY ERADICATE THE PROBLEM. IF THERE IS A ONE YEAR STATUTE LIMITATION WHICH IS CURRENTLY ON LAW AND THAT ALLOWS EMPLOYERS TO BE NOTIFIED OF THE HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION AND ALLOWS EMPLOYER TO DETERMINE WHAT TO DO WITH THE EMPLOYEE THE ALLEGED HARASSER OR DISCRIMINATE. INDIVIDUAL THAT'S DISCRIMINATING ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL DOES IS NOT LIMITED TO JUST SEXUAL HARASSMENT IT EXPANDS EXTENDS THE STATUE LIMITATIONS FOR ALL FEE HOW CLAIMS. AND. RIGHT NOW THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY TWENTY THREE THOUSAND FEE HA CLAIMS THAT WERE FILED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING IF YOU TRIPLE THAT THAT COULD POTENTIALLY COME TO SEVENTY OVER SEVENTY THOUSAND CLAIMS THAT ARE DEEP FILED WITH APARTMENT APPARENTLY HOUSING. NOT ALL OF THESE CLAIMS ACTUALLY HAVE EVIDENCE IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THEIR. ALLEGATIONS AND SO THIS WOULD ACTUALLY. IMPOSE A MAJOR LIABILITY ON EMPLOYERS FOR CLAIMS THAT MIGHT NOT BE ACTION HAVE VALUED AND SO WE ARE ASKING FOR TWO YEAR SESSION LIMITATIONS WHICH IS ACTUALLY THE SAME. AS AND THE TORQUE STATUE LIMITATIONS FOR ASSAULT BATTERY AND INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS THAT WAY THERE STANDARDIZED TO YOUR SUCH LIMITATIONS FOR ALL. OF THESE TYPES OF ALLEGATIONS ADDITIONALLY THERE'S SOMETHING IS SOME CLARIFICATION THAT I WOULD LIKE TO. SHARE IS THAT THIS DOES NOT AFFECT THE ABILITY FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TO BRING A CLAIM AGAINST THE HARASSER OR AT THE. INDIVIDUAL THAT'S ACTING AGAINST THEM THIS ONLY HAS TO DO WITH THE EMPLOYERS LIABILITY THE INDIVIDUAL IF THERE'S NO AT THE STATUE LIMITATIONS HAS RUN THAT THE INDIVIDUAL CAN STILL GO AFTER THE. PERSON THAT HARASSED THEM AND AND FINALLY WITH THAT THE. THAT CHANGES THAT WILL ALLOW FOR THE EMPLOYEE URK SORRY I'M UNDER THE LAW IF THE EMPLOYER IS ALREADY REQUIRED TO NOTIFY EMPLOYEES OF THEIR WHEN YOU'RE SUCH LIMITATIONS THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING. NOTIFICATIONS THAT ARE REQUIRED AND BY LAW TO BEEF HANDED OUT TO EMPLOYEES THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE UPPER. AGAIN WE WOULD REQUEST THAT IT BE LIMITED TO TWO YEARS IN THE LIMITED TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT COMPLAINTS. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO ADD ON IN OPPOSITION.

THINK IT'S THE TIME PERIOD THERE WERE SOME THERE ARE SOME REQUEST THAT IT BE TEN YEARS OR SOME REQUEST THAT THERE NOT BE A STATUE LIMITATIONS AT ALL.

IS HE YOU MUST FILE A CLAIM WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING AS A PRECURSOR. WITHIN ONE YEAR AND YOU'RE POLICY THE GOOD WITH TWO TO THREE YEARS CORRECT THAT DID I HEAR THAT THERE WOULD IS FROM THAT CAL CHAMBER SAY THEY'RE WILLING TO GO TO TWO YEARS YES YES. OKAY SO I GUESS THERE IS A KNOWLEDGE OF IT THAT ONE YEAR IS NOT. LONG ENOUGH. THAT'S POINT NUMBER ONE. POINT NUMBER TWO. AS WE HEARD FROM YOUR TESTIMONY IS THAT SOMETIMES YOU'RE NOT READY TO TO TO COME FORWARD RIGHT AWAY SO. I'M NOT CERTAIN BY HAVING IT THREE YEARS IT'S GONNA STOP A PERSON WHO WANTS TO TELL THEIR EMPLOYER AND FILE A CLAIM TO. HAVE THE EMPLOYER TRY TO STOP THE BEHAVIOR IN THE WORKPLACE BUT. GIVE PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR WHEN IT FINALLY BECOMES RIGHT FOR THEM TO TO STEP FORWARD AND YOU KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER REASONS ON A WALK IN THE SHOES BUT. SEE HOW YOU MAKE THE COMPELLING CASE WELL AFTER A FEW YEARS. BEYOND ONE ESSENTIALLY THREE YEARS THIS IS THE RIGHT CASA. I THINK THIS MAKES SENSE AND I CERTAINLY AM A CO AUTHOR BILL I SUPPORTED THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOOK LIKE ADULTS FLETCHER. FIRST OF ALL TO WITNESS THANK YOU FOR JUST FINE AND. I THINK YOUR SERIES OF QUESTIONS KIND GOT ME AND YES WE BELIEVE YOU KNOW WHAT WE THINK OF YOU IS. THAT YOU'RE DOING THIS ALL SERVICE BY BEING WILLING TO COME OUT AND SPEAK AND TELL YOUR STORY IN. THAT IT IS A SYMBOL OF A LARGER MOVEMENT OF COURSE THAT HAS BEEN WILLING TO DO THAT SIR THANK YOU. I'M. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AYE I A WOULD JUST REITERATE WHAT MY COLLEAGUE SAID. I. I I KIND OF WORRY EVEN THAT THREE YEARS IS ENOUGH YOU KNOW I'M WE KNOW WHEN. A PERSONAL TRAUMA DEPENDING ON WHAT HAPPENED. CAN BE HARD FOR PEOPLE TO. COME TO TERMS WITH MAKE A DECISION ABOUT THAT THERE'S A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT COULD COME UP. AND SO I AM. HAVING WORKING IN THE SPACE RIGHT NOW I THINK WE'RE LEARNING MORE AND MORE ABOUT HOW DIFFERENT EVERYBODY REACTS TO THE SITUATIONS SO I THINK. I'M THREE YEARS IS MORE THAN REASONABLE AYE I THINK IT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND I'M HAPPY I. THINK OF ARTICLE AUTHOR OF NOT TO. BE A CO AUTHOR NOW WE NEED YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE. SOME AREAS IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. I THINK THAT. AND WITH IT THE HEARINGS WE HAVE HEARD DURING THE HEARINGS WE'VE HEARD FROM MANY OF THE VICTIMS. AND I THINK WE NEED TO DO MUCH MORE THAN JUST SAY WE'RE SORRY THIS HAPPENED TO YOU WE DO NEED TO TAKE ACTION. AND I DO BELIEVE THIS IS ONE PART. OF AN ENTIRE IS SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO FOR THOSE FOR VICTIMS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY. THANK YOU SO REMEMBER FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND TAKING THAT ACTION. THIS BILL DOES ENJOY A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION FROM THE CHAIR AND SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS THURMAN AYE THURMAN AYE FLORA. FLORA AYE GONZALEZ FLETCHER. GONZALEZ FLETCHER AYE JONES SAWYER JONES SAWYER AYE KALRA MCCARTY AYE MCCARTY AYE MATHIS. THE BILL WAS OUT REGULATION THANK YOU THANK YOU. YEAH. NEXT BILL. REMOVING TO ITEM ONE EIGHTEEN SIXTY SEVEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. TODAY I PRESENT TO YOU A. B. EIGHTEEN SIXTY SEVEN THE TRACK. THE TRUCKING RECORDS AND COMPLAINTS ACT REQUIRES THAT EMPLOYERS OF FIFTY OR MORE EMPLOYEES RETAIN EMPLOYEE COMPLAINTS. FILED THROUGH THE INTERNAL COMPLINT PROCESS OF THE EMPLOYER. FOR A PERIOD OF TEN YEARS FROM THE DATE OF FILING. AS YOU KNOW THE RULES SUBCOMMITTEE ON HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION AND RETALIATION PREVENTION. WAS CREATED TO MAKE A SERIOUS AND COMPREHENSIVE EFFORT TO REFORM THE ASSEMBLY IS HARASSMENT POLICIES. PROCEDURES AND TRAINING. AT THE NOVEMBER TWENTY EIGHTH TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN HEARING OF THIS RULES SUBCOMMITTEE ONE OF THE KEY TAKEAWAYS WAS OF EXISTING LAW DOESN'T REQUIRE EMPLOYERS TO RETAIN RECORDS. SEXUAL HARASSMENT COMPLAINTS. EXECS EXISTING LAW LEAVES RETENTION OF THESE TYPES OF RECORDS TO THE EMPLOYERS INTERNAL POLICIES. GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION ONE TWO NINE FOUR ZERO OKAY. REQUIRES THAT EMPLOYERS TAKE ALL REASONABLE STEPS NECESSARY TO PREVENT DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT FROM OCCURRING. NOT MAINTAINING RECORDS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT COMPLAINTS PUTS BOTH EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES AT RISK. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPONENTS OF ADDRESSING SEXUAL MISCONDUCT IS HAVING DETAILED RECORDS OF WHAT EXACTLY TOOK PLACE. IN ORDER TO DISCERN WHETHER THERE ARE REPEAT OFFENDERS AND WHETHER THE EMPLOYER TOOK APPROPRIATE CORRECTIVE ACTION. FOR PARTICULARLY LARGE COMPANIES A FAILURE TO MAINTAIN RECORDS COULD LEAD TO A PER A PERPETRATOR SAMPLING SIMPLY BEING ABLE TO SWITCH LOCATIONS. START ALL OVER AGAIN. FOR ANYONE BOTH VICTIM AND THE ACCUSED WE HAVE TO FOLLOW DUE PROCESS. BUT WE MUST BE FAIR TO OUR VICTIMS. IF THE BEHAVIOR HAS BEEN THERE IN THE PAST AND IS NOT BEING DOCUMENTED PROPERLY. THAT BEHAVIOR COULD BECOME A PROBLEM OF THE BODY AND ADD IT TO THE CULTURE OF LACKING TRANSPARENCY AND PROTECTION. IT IS CRUCIAL THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH DOCUMENTATION TO BE ABLE TO REVIEW BEHAVIOR. ON BOTH THE VICTIMS AND THE PERPETRATOR. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS MANDY J. BENSON WITH MJ BENSON CONSULTING WHO SPECIALIZES IN SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION TRAINING. AND RICO. ESQUIRE. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL AND POLICY DIRECTOR WITH CALIFORNIA PLUMMET LAWYERS ASSOCIATION OR SELAH. THANK YOU PERSUADE IS PLEASE. WELL HI. I MANY BENSON AND AS A WOMAN AS A SEXUAL HARASSMENT SURVIVOR AND AS AN HR AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION SPECIALIST I SUPPORT AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY SEVEN. AT TWENTY TWO YEARS OLD I BEGAN WORKING AT CLAIM JUMPER REST NOT MANY OF US HAVE PROBABLY BEEN TEARING YOU KNOW IT'S A REALLY LARGE BREASTS NOT REALLY LARGE CHAIN. AND WHEN I FIRST BEGAN THERE WAS JUST IN THE. LAST YEAR OF COLLEGE AND. MY FIRST FEW DAYS OF WORKING THERE ANONYMOUS LA SHOWED UP TO WORK. AND THIS KEPT HAPPENING NOT A BOYFRIEND AND HE OTHER THE FLOWER SENDING TYPES OF IS PRETTY CONFUSED AND ONE OF THE OTHER SERVERS HELP ME OUT WHICH WAS LIKE. IF THE KITCHEN MANAGER HE DOES THIS ALL THE NEW GIRLS. I'LL TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. YOU'RE GOING TO REJECT THEM HE'S GONNA GET MAD IF IT'S GONNA COME OUT LATE THE BUSBOYS ARE GONNA CLEAN YOUR TABLES ANYMORE. YOUR TIPS ARE GONNA START TO SUFFER THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. SO I COMPLAIN I WANT TO THE MANAGERS THE TWO OTHER MANAGERS THERE AND ARE NONE OF THEM ARE WOMEN SO I ASKED THE HEAD WAITRESS TO COME INTO THE MEETING IS WHILE I HAD A VERY FORMAL SIT DOWN MEETING COMPLAINING OF THIS HARASSMENT. AND THEY SHRUG AND ASK ME WHAT THEY COULD DO ABOUT IT THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT HE WAS JUST BEING NICE AND FLOWERS. SO THEN I EXPLAIN TO THEM AT TWENTY TWO YEARS OLD BUT RETALIATION WHAT SOME THAT THERE WAS A LOT CONSTRUED DELEGATION AND ALL OF THESE BEHAVIORS ARE. ACTIONS AGAINST ME WARRANTY RETALIATION AND AGAIN THEY SHRUGGED. SO I GAVE MY FORMAL NOTICE RIGHT THEN I'D I'D. GIVE QUIT ON THE SPOT AND I TOLD THEM I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO CEO AND. UP AT SO I'M NOT GOING TO BE THE ONE BUT SOMEBODY SOMEDAY IS GONNA NEED TO SEE IT BECAUSE THIS IS RIDICULOUS THIS IS HAPPENING TO MANY MANY WOMEN. AND IF WE HAVE A LOT LIKE THIS BACK THAT. THIS BEHAVIOR WOULD HAVE BEEN TRACKED AND EVENTUALLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN STOPPED. NOW I'M RUNNING INTO A FENCE AND CONSULTING TO PROVIDE SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION SERVICES SO I CAN HELP EDUCATE EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES ON THEIR RIGHTS AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO HELP STOP. SEXUAL HARASSMENT I SUPPORT EIGHTEEN SIXTY SEVEN BECAUSE HARASSERS LIKE THIS MANAGERS CAN HIDE IN A BIG COMPANY THEY DO HIDE IN A VICTIM COMPANY NOT ONLY DO THEY CHANGED LOCATIONS A CHANGE POSITIONS AND SORT OF. SPITTING CAN IMAGINE A BIG MULTI OUR INTERNATIONAL COMPANY RIGHT THEY CAN CHANGE LOCATIONS IN THE WHOLE HISTORY DISAPPEARS UP THERE'S NO PAPER TRAIL TO FOLLOW THEM. BUT THE OTHER THING THAT CAN HAPPEN IN THIS CAN EVEN HAPPEN OF SMALLER COMPANY IS THE MANAGER OR THE HR PERSON THAT DID THAT AND AND INVESTIGATE SHOWN. THEY MAY LEAVE AND NOBODY ELSE IN THE WHOLE ORGANIZATION MIGHT EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT. SO THIS BILL WOULDN'T NOT ONLY HOW THE VICTIMS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT BUT IT WOULD INDEED HELP THE CORPORATIONS AS WELL SO MANY HR MANAGERS I TALK TO WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THE FUNDING THAT THEY NEED. AND THE TIME THAT THEY NEED TO INSTITUTE THE KINDS OF TRACKING SYSTEMS NEEDED FOR THE S. BUT THEY DON'T GET THE OKAY ON THE BUDGET NOR TO SPEND THEIR TIME THIS WOULD HELP THOSE HR MANAGERS. GET THAT BUDGETS THEY NEED AND THE TIME AND STAFFING THEY NEED TO IMPLEMENT THE SYSTEM. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN REYES MARIE CARRIER SHE HIGHER WITH THE CALIFORNIA PLUMMET LAWYERS ASSOCIATION OUR ATTORNEYS FOR DECADES OF AND FIGHTING TO DEFEND WOMEN LIKE MANDY WHO HAVE BEEN SEXUALLY HARASSED IN THE WORKPLACE. OUR JOURNEYS FIND THAT WOULD IS VERY COMMON IN WORKPLACES WHERE THERE'S RAMPANT PERVASIVE SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS THAT THERE'S NO CLEAR RECORD RETENTION POLICY THERE'S NO TRACKING OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT COMPLAINTS. IF THE EMPLOYER IS NOT WELL DOCUMENTING THESE TYPES OF COMPLAINTS AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE WORKPLACE. NUMBER ONE IT MEANS THAT THE EMPLOYEE USUALLY FEELS LIKE THEY'RE NOT BEING LISTENED TO. OFTEN IT MEANS THAT THE EMPLOYER IS NOT APPROPRIATELY INVESTIGATING THE COMPLAINT AND A LOT OF TIMES IT MEANS THAT THE PERSON WHO IS. ENGAGING IN THE HARASSING CONDUCT DOES NOT FEEL ACCOUNTABLE FOR THAT CONDUCT. ON AN AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS POINTED OUT IT'S ALSO VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY WHEN THERE ARE REPEAT OFFENDERS ESPECIALLY IF THE WORKER MOVES AROUND TO DIFFERENT JOBS ARE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS. ON IN A VERY LARGE CORPORATION. AND WE HAVE HEARD FROM MANY CASES WHERE THERE ARE MULTIPLE SEXUAL HARASSMENT COMPLAINTS ALLEGED AGAINST THE SAME. EMPLOYEE BUT BECAUSE AGAIN THERE IS NO DOCUMENTATION THERE WAS NO COORDINATION OF THE COMPLAINT THE HARASSING CONDUCT WAS ABLE TO CONTINUE ON A LOT OF TIMES IT'S. IT ESCALATES I'M AND THE FEE HOW DOES REQUIRE THAT EMPLOYERS TAKE ALL REASONABLE STEPS TO PREVENT HARASSMENT FROM OCCURRING IN THE WORKPLACE. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS WELL DOCUMENTED OR ACTUALLY GONNA HOLD EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTABLE TO THIS VERY IMPORTANT DUTY TO ITS WORKPLACE UNTO ITS WORKERS SO FOR THESE REASONS WE THINKS I'M STRENGTHENING THE RECORD RETENTION REQUIREMENTS FOR EMPLOYERS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. IT'S. IT'S AN IMPORTANT STRATEGY FOR ADDRESSING SEXUAL HARASSMENT SO WE STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU OTHERS WISHING TO ADD ON IN SUPPORT.

PLEASE COME FOR. PLEASE HAS EIGHT. HELLO GOOD AFTERNOON SO I REALIZE I THINK GOOD MORNING EARLIER THIRTY AFTERNOON MY NAME'S LAURA CURTIS AND I AM HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND THE AND WE DO WANT TO. THANK THEM ASSEMBLY MEMBER REYES OFFICE THEY HAVE BEEN I AM VERY OPEN TO DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS BILL AND WE APPRECIATE THEM REACHING OUT IN DISCUSSING AND AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY SEVEN WITH US WE ARE ON AN OPPOSE MUST AMENDED POSITION BECAUSE CURRENTLY THERE ARE SEVEN LAWS IN CALIFORNIA. THAT DETERMINE WHAT TYPES OF DOCUMENTS NEED TO BE RETAINED HOW LONG THESE DOCUMENTS NEED TO BE RETAINED AND EMPLOYERS CAN BARELY KEEP UP WITH OF SEVEN DIFFERENT LAWS. AND ADDITIONALLY THIS BUT THERE ARE ALREADY LAWS IN PLACE REGARDING GRIEVANCES AND. UP BY AN EMPLOYEE AND THAT'S COVERED BY LABOR CODE ELEVEN NINETY EIGHT POINT FIVE THAT PERSON THAT GOES ALONG WITH THE PERSONNEL FILE THAT HAS TO BE KEPT DURING THE DURATION OF THE EMPLOYEES. EMPLOYMENT AND THREE YEARS AFTER ADDITIONALLY UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING REGULATION CC ARE ELEVEN NO TWO THREE THERE IS DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS OR. COMPLAINTS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT SO WE FEEL THAT THESE ARE ALREADY COVERED UNDER THE LAW THAT THESE DOCUMENTS SHOULD THAT INVESTIGATIONS AND COMPLAINTS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AM ARE BEING REQUIRED TO BE DOCUMENTED UNDER THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING. EIGHTEEN SIXTY SEVEN WOULD MORE THAN TRIPLE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR PERSONNEL FILE BECAUSE PERSONNEL FILE RETENTION IS THREE YEARS THIS WOULD ALLOW FOR TEN YEARS WE FEEL THIS IS OVER BURDENING ON EMPLOYERS WHO WOULD THEN HAVE TO KEEP SEPARATE DOCUMENTATION AND TRY TO KEEP UP WITH THESE. DIFFERENT AND REQUIREMENTS AND FOR THAT REASON WE ARE POSING WITH AMENDED REQUESTING THAT IT BE AND MITIGATED TO EITHER THAT PERSONNEL FILE DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS OR FIVE YEAR PROVISION THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SUCH ON LOUIS NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESS REPRESENTING OVER TWENTY THOUSAND. SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ALSO OPPOSE THE REASONS ALREADY STATED WOULD LIKE JUST ADD SOME SPECIFIC CONCERNS THAT SMALL EMPLOYERS HAVE ON THIS AS MANY OF YOU KNOW. VAST MAJORITY OF SMALL BUSINESSES DON'T HAVE ENTIRE DEPARTMENTS DEDICATED TOTHESE ISSUES OF SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS MORE OFTEN THAN NOT DON'T HAVE. AN HR DEPARTMENT OR A COMPLAINTS DEPARTMENT OR LEGAL DEPARTMENT OR PAYROLL DEPARTMENT THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR MEMBERS THE BUSINESS ON A THEMSELVES SERVES TO TO MEET ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT NEEDS. AND SO THIS. SO THESE ARE COMPLICATIONS THAT WOULD ADD. UNDER THIS BILL. IN ADDITION TO THE THOUSANDS OF BILLS AND LAWS THAT WE ARE TO COMPLY WITH WITH IT WILL BE A BURDEN TO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS I THINK. ONE OF THE KEY POINTS IS THAT. WE SAW AS THE AUTHORITY STATED. THE LEGISLATURE ITSELF IS IS ADDRESSING THIS VERY COMPLEX AND VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. JUST DEFINING THESE THINGS WHAT IS A COMPLAINT WHAT DEFINES IT CONSTITUTES A FORMAL COMPLAINT AND A COMPLAINT PROCESS IS A COMPLEX ISSUE AND DIFFICULT TO DEFINE. AND WE HAVE VERY VERY BRIGHT MINDS IN THIS LEGISLATURE TRIED TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS. SO FOR THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNER NOW HAVING TRIED TRYING TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS IS VERY DIFFICULT WITHOUT THE CLEAR DEAN AND GUIDANCE ON THOSE DEFINITIONS. WE ARE UNFORTUNATELY ALSO OPPOSE THIS TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO ADD ON IN OPPOSITION YOUR NAME AFFILIATION AND YOUR POSITION. GALGIANI A BE OUT THE FAMILY BUSINESS ASSOCIATION OPPOSED LOS AMEND. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO ADD ON IN OPPOSITION. THE SCENE ON I TURN TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO SEE IF THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. CEMENT FLOOR. I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I DO WANNA MAKES. DISCOVER RECORD A STATEMENT ON THE RECORD LIKE THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS SITUATION AND SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN LIGHTLY. BUT THE BURDEN THAT IT DOES PUT ON SMALL BUSINESS. PRIMARILY COMING ALL THE SMALL BUSINESS FAMILY THIS IS WHAT WE DO. AND THE OPPOSITION RAISES A VERY UNIQUE POINT IS WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY. THE LEGIONS OF ATTORNEYS TO FIGHT THIS AND TO REPRESENT SO IT IS A VERYVERY BIG ISSUE. SIDE PLEASE I'M CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION AS I AM TO BE SUPPORTING THIS TODAY. BUT. I DO HAVE SOME VERY STRONG CONCERNS ABOUT THIS NOT BECAUSE OF. DIMINISHING THE ISSUES OF HARASSMENT IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. BUT THE ASPECT OF THE BUSINESS AND THE RELATIONSHIP WITHIN THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY I NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED OF THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER MEMBERS FROM THE COMMITTEE SOME OF. THERE'S A MOTION AND A SECOND. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE A SIMILAR RACE. I WOULD LIKE TO JUST REITERATE THAT. AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY SEVEN WILL APPLY. TO EMPLOYERS WITH FIFTY. OR MORE EMPLOYEES SO WE DID TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WAS VERY SMALL BUSINESSES. IN COMING THROUGH THIS. THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THEIR HOUSE TO BE A STANDARD WE HEARD ABOUT THE VARIOUS SECTIONS IN THE LABOR CODE IN DFU H. REGULATIONS. ABOUT RECORD RETENTION BUT WE NEED SOMETHING THAT IS COHESIVE SOMETHING THAT WE NEED A STANDARD. THAT IS UNIFORM SO THAT ALL EMPLOYERS WITH FIFTY EMPLOYEES OR MORE. KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY NEED TO RETAIN IN THE RECORDS. AND WE BELIEVE THAT A B. EIGHTEEN SIXTY SEVEN THE TRACK ACT IS THE RIGHT STEP. BUT WE WILL CONTINUE NONE THE LESS TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO SEE IF WE CAN ALLEVIATE SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS. AND TODAY I DO RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU THIS BILL DOES ENJOY A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION FROM THE CHAIR THANK YOU FOR BRINGING FOR THIS VERY IMPORTANT LEGISLATION MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MOTION HAS DO PASSED TWO APPROPRIATIONS THURMOND AYE THURMAN AYE FLORA. FLORA AYE GONZALEZ FLETCHER GONZALEZ FLETCHER AYE JONES SAWYER JONES SAWYER AYE KALRA MCCARTY. MCCARTY AYE MATHIS. THAT BILL IS OUT THE REGULATIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU. MOVING TO FILE ITEM EH THIRTEEN AB TWENTY SIX THIRTEEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE. ON AB TWENTY SIX THIRTEEN A BILL WHICH PROVIDES EMPLOYEES MORE EFFECTIVE TOOLS TO RECOVER THEIR WAGES WHEN THEY ARE NOT PAID ON TIME. FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK BEING PAID ON TIME IS IMPERATIVE FOR MAKING SURE THE COMPARISONS AND BILLS. PURCHASE FOOD AND TAKE CARE OF THE DAILY NECESSITIES. IF PAID LATE MANY OF THESE BILLS INCUR LATE FEES. AT OR INTEREST CHARGES DAMAGE THE EMPLOYEES CREDIT AND PLACES THE INDIVIDUAL. WHERE THEY FACE ONGOING COSTS BECAUSE OF THAT DAMAGED CREDIT? SIMPLY PUT BEING PAID LATE IS NOT JUST AN INCONVENIENCE FOR THE EMPLOYEE. BUT COSTS THE EMPLOYEE AMPLE AMOUNTS OF MONEY IN THE LONG TERM. AB TWENTY SIX THIRTEEN SIMPLIFIES A PENALTY STRUCTURE TO ENSURE PENALTIES ARE GIVEN TO THE EMPLOYEE TO COMPENSATE THEM FOR ANY ADDITIONAL COST THEY'VE INCURRED. BECAUSE OF THE LATE PAYMENT RATHER THAN HAVE THE PENALTY PAID TO THE LABOR COMMISSIONER. IT ALSO ENABLES EMPLOYEES TO ENFORCE THEIR RIGHTS ON PAYMENT. LASTLY PROVIDES THE LABOR COMMISSIONER WITH THE ABILITY TO ADEQUATELY ENFORCE THESE PROVISIONS AND ENSURE THAT EMPLOYEES ARE RECEIVING THEIR DUE WAGES. WHILE I UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY GROUPS. THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER IN THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING BUILDERS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. MY OFFICE IS COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THESE GROUPS TO FIND WAYS TO MITIGATE THEIR CONCERNS. WORKING CALIFORNIANS DESERVE TO BE PAID ON TIME. TO ENSURE THEY DO NOT INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS ON THEIR BILLS AND RENT. AND THAT THEY CAN ADEQUATELY SUPPORT THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES AS BUDGETED. IT IS FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS IN THAT THAT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY. I'VE A FEW GUESTS HERE WITH ME TO DISCUSS MORE ON THE ISSUE. THEN YELLOW URBAN. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CENTER FOR WORKERS RIGHTS. CATHERINE FI STIR AN ATTORNEY AND LEGAL AID WORK. AND MARIE GO YOSHIHARA FROM THE CALIFORNIA PLUMMET LAWYERS ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU WE DO LOOK FOR TEAR WITNESSES WE ARE ON BILL NUMBER FOUR AND WE'VE BEEN AN HOUR WE'RE GONNA BE ASKING THAT EVERYONE APPLY TO TWO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES. IF YOU ALL COULD AND YOU CAN ARRANGE A TIME ACCORDINGLY HOWEVER YOU WISH TO LOOK FOR THE TESTIMONY. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN BUT THAT THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DANIELLE URBAN AND I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR WORKERS RIGHTS A LEGAL SERVICES NONPROFIT. I'VE ASSISTING LOW WAGE WORKERS IN WORKPLACE ISSUES AND IN PARTICULAR IN WAGE THAT'S LOCATED HERE IN AS YOU KNOW ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY TH DISTRICT. WE OUR PROUD COSPONSORED AB TWENTY SIX THIRTEEN BECAUSE UNDER CURRENT LAW THERE IS NO PRACTICAL REMEDY FOR EMPLOYEES ARE NOT PAID ON TIME. THIS CAN CAUSE EXTREME FINANCIAL HARDSHIP FOR MANY EMPLOYEES WHO LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK. AND NEED THEIR WAGES PAID ON TIME SO THAT THEY CAN PAY PER FOR FOOD RENT AND OTHER DAILY NECESSITIES. THE PROBLEM IS THAT EMPLOYEES WERE PAID LATE HAVE NO CLEAR EFFECTIVE RECOURSE. I PRESIDENT EMPLOYEE COULD TRY TO FILE A LAWSUIT UNDER THE FEDERAL LABOR STANDARDS ACT WILL BE CONFLICTS THAT. TO RECOVER THE UNPAID WAGES PLUS AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO LIQUIDATED DAMAGES TOGETHER WITH PREJUDGMENT INTEREST. OR EMPLOYEES COULD TRY TO FILE A CLAIM WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER UNDER LABOR CODE SECTIONS ELEVEN NINETY FOUR AND ELEVEN NINETY FOUR POINT CHU CHU RECOVER UNPAID MINIMUM WAGES PLUS AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO LIQUIDATED DAMAGES. BUT THESE EFFORTS ARE OFTEN NOT REALISTIC FOR EMPLOYEES WHO SIMPLY WANT TO BE PAID THEIR WAGES ON TIME. AND COMPENSATED FOR THE LOSS IS CAUSED BY THE LEAGUE PAYMENT. BY THE TIME THE CLAIM GET STARTED EMPLOYEE MAY HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED THE BACK WAGES. AND EVEN IF NOT THE EXPENSE OF A LAWSUIT OR CLEANING EASILY EXCEEDS THE AMOUNT OF FOOD. EMPLOYEES ARE RELUCTANT TO ROCK THE BOAT AND PURSUE A CLAIM. BECAUSE THE COST OF CONFLICT WITH THEIR EMPLOYER FOR A JOB THAT THEY DESPERATELY NEED TO KEEP AND THEY FEAR RETALIATION. UNDER THE CURRENT LABOR CODE SECTION TWO TEN THERE ISN'T ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM FOR EMPLOYERS WHO DO NOT PAY THEIR WORKERS ON TIME. BUT UNFORTUNATELY ONLY ENFORCEABLE THROUGH AN INDEPENDENT ACTION BY THE LABOR COMMISSIONER AND ANY PENALTIES GO TO THE STATE AND NOT TO THE AGGRIEVED WORKER. BECAUSE OF THE LIMITATIONS THAT PROVISION IS SIMPLY NEVER UTILIZED. THAT LEAVES EMPLOYERS WITH LITTLE OR NO INCENTIVE TO PAY HIM EMPLOYEES ON TIME AND IN FACT IN THE FACT IT TURNS WORKERS AND PARTICULARLY LOW WAGE WORKERS. INTO INVOLUNTARY STEP CLIMB UP PRIME LENDERS A FIRST RESORT AND IF PLAINLY UNFAIR. WELL DONE THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KATHERINE FEES START I'M A STAFF ATTORNEY AT LEGALLY AT WORK I WORK SPECIFICALLY IN THE WAGE PROTECTION PROGRAM. BUT WE REPRESENTS SCORES OF LOW WAGE IMMIGRANT WORKERS TO RECOVER THE WAGES THAT ARE OWED TO THEM. WE HOLD SEMI MONTHLY WAGE CLAIM CLINICS AT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE AND WE RESERVE OVER A HUNDRED WORKERS EVERY YEAR. THIS LAW IS ABOUT A MOST BASIC WAGE AND HOUR RIGHT FOR EMPLOYEES TO BE PAID THE WAGES THEY EARN ON TIME. WE REPEATEDLY GET CALLS FROM WORKERS WHO ARE NOT PAID ON TIME AND WE SEE THE DEVASTATING IMPACT LATE PAYCHECKS HAVE ON LOW WAGE WORKERS. OUR SON OUR CLIENTS SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE THEIR JOBS SOME MANY TIMES THEY ARE FORCED TO LIVE WITH THEIR EMPLOYERS PAYING THEM LATE. BELIEVING THAT SOME MONEY AT SOME POINT IS BETTER THAN NO MONEY AT ALL. UNDER THE CURRENT LAW THERE IS NO PRACTICAL RECORDS FOR THESE WORKERS WHICH IS PERHAPS WHY THE VIOLATION IS SO PREVALENT. THERE IS LITTLE INCENTIVE TO COMPLY WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING REPRESENTING TEN WORKERS AT A POPULAR SAN FRANCISCO RESTAURANT WHERE THEY'RE REPEATEDLY PAID NOT ONLY THEIR WAGES LATE BUT THEIR TIPS LEAVE AS WELL. AS A RESULT OF THESE LATE PAYMENTS WORKERS ARE NOT ABLE TO TIMELY PAY THEIR RENTS. STUDENT LOANS OTHER BILLS INCURRING LATE FEES INTEREST CHARGES AND DAMAGING THEIR CREDIT ONE OF OUR CLIENTS WAS THREATENED WITH EVICTION PROCEEDINGS IF HIS RUN CONTINUE TO ARRIVE LATE. THESE FINANCIAL PREDICAMENTS CREE AND UNNECESSARY STRESS AND ANXIETY FOR WORKERS WHOSE LIVES ARE STRESSFUL ENOUGH ALREADY. THESE TEN WORKERS WHO EARN THE MINIMUM WAGE COULD AND JOIN US TODAY AS THEY HAVE TO WORK BUT HERE ARE SOME QUOTES FROM THEIR RECENT DECLARATIONS. AN INJUNCTION THAT WE FILED WITH THE COURT REQUESTING THAT THE COURT ORDER THE EMPLOYER. TO PAY THEIR WORKERS ON TIME. ONE ONE WORKER QUOTE THE TIME I'VE SPENT SO. SIMPLY ASKING TO RECEIVE MY PAYCHECK IS ENORMOUS AND UNPAID IT IS DEMORALIZING TO HAVE TO ASK FOR MONEY THAT I HAVE WORKED HARD TO EARN. IT IS ALSO VERY STRESSFUL AND THE ANXIETY FROM NOT KNOWING IF AND WHEN I'M GOING TO BE PAID JUST GROWS. ANOTHER WORKER QUOTE I LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK AND DEPEND ON MY WAY JUST TO SUPPORT MY FIVE YEAR OLD SON AND WIFE I RELY ON MY WAY JUST TO PAY OUR RENT. BUY FOOD AND PAY OUR BILLS IT'S FRUSTRATING NOT KNOWING WHAT I'M GOING TO BE PAID I WORRY ABOUT HOW I WILL PAY FOR MY FAMILY'S MONTHLY EXPENSES FACE IF YOU COULD PLEASE CONCLUDE. YES. THANK YOU THIS IS IMPORTANT ILLEGALLY AT WORK BECAUSE OUR LOW WAGE WORKER COMMUNITY AS MOST VULNERABLE TO LATE PAYMENT OF WAGES. IF EMPLOYERS ONLY HAVE TO EVENTUALLY PAY THE WAGES THEY ARE OWED ALREADY WITHOUT ANYTHING MORE THERE'S LITTLE LEGAL INCENTIVE TO COMPLY. AND TURN THE CURRENT LAWS FEELING R. THOUGH WHICH CLIENT COMMUNITY AND AB TWO SIX ONE THREE AS A FAIR REMEDY TO THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OTHERS WISHING TO ADD ON IN SUPPORT PLEASE COME FORWARD. IT PROVIDES YOU NAME YOUR AFFILIATION AND YOUR POSITION. HARIKA SHARPENING. YEAH MY GAYDAR WITH THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION FOR ALL THE REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED WHEREIN STRONG SUPPORT MAKE YOU.

BOB JEREMY HAVE THE NATIONAL UNION HEALTHCARE WORKERS IN SUPPORT. Q. ANYONE ELSE ADDING ON TO SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. PLEASE COME FORWARD. I SEAT GOOD AFTERNOON MARKER TESTS WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE ARE OPPOSED TO YOU AB TWENTY SIX THIRTEEN AND HONESTLY WE ARE I'M CONFUSED BY THIS BILL. CURRENTLY UNDER TWO TEN OF THE PENALTIES CAN BE RECOVERED BY THE STATE I AM SO THOSE PAYMENTS GO TOWARDS THE STATE FOR THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT AND FOR THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S DEPARTMENT. THOSE PENALTIES CAN ALSO BE RECOVERED UNDER FIVE FIVE EIGHT OF THE LABOR CODE FOR UNDERPAID WAGES SO THE EMPLOYEE DOES HAVE THE SAME THIS BILL TWENTY SIX THIRTEEN AS WRITTEN. JUST ADDS ADDITIONAL PENALTIES THE SAME PENALTY DETERMINATIONS ARE MADE IN FIVE FIVE EIGHT AND TEN AND TWO TEN WOULD APPLY TO THESE UNDERPAID WAGES OR LATE PAYMENTS. SO THIS JUST TRIES TO ADD PENALTIES ON TOP OF PENALTIES ON TOP PENALTIES AND ADDING THOSE ON OF THOSE PENALTIES AND SIMPLY WILL JUST CREATE ADDITIONAL LITIGATION FOR EMPLOYERS. CURRENTLY AS WE FOUND WILL BE HEARING LATER TODAY THEIR PAGA CONCERNS WHERE EMPLOYERS ARE FACING EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR RECOVERY WHERE THE PLANE TO WHERE THE ACTUAL PLAINTIFF THE INJURED EMPLOYEE ONLY GOT FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AT THAT EIGHT MILLION. AND EACH ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEE ONLY GOT FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS WHERE THE PLAINTIFFS PARTICLE WAIT TWO MILLION DOLLARS OF THOSE RECOVERIES THESE ADDITIONAL BURDENS ON EMPLOYERS JUST SIMPLY ARE AND WE OBVIOUSLY DO NOT CONDONE WAGE THAT BUT THIS IS A. PEELING OR THIS IS. REQUIRING A PAYMENT OF FOR PENALTIES FOR AN INTENTIONAL VIOLATIONS WHICH ARE ALREADY COVERED UNDER THE LABOR CODE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY WHERE AND WE. APPRECIATE OPPOSITION THANK YOU JUST OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIRMAN ARE HIS OR HER MEMBERS CHRIS MCKAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA AMBULANCE ASSOCIATION AND A. HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOUR CHIEF CONSULTANT TODAY. WANTED TO RAISE THREE HAD. WANTED TO RAISE THREE EDITION DID SHE WRITE THIS ANALYSIS IN YOU HAVE IF YOU HAVE THE CONSULTANT HAS NO BEARING ON THE POLICY YEAH. AND WE WILL NOT BE CREDIT IN YOUR TIME FOR HOW CAN THE PLEASE CONTINUE EARLY. WE DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF. SPENDING TIME WITH US ON THE DIFFERENT ITERATIONS OF THIS BILL I WANT TO RAISE THREE ISSUES. THE FIRST IS STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS OF CURRENT CIVIL CODE ART COULD CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTION THREE FORTY. PROVIDES A ONE YEAR LIMITATION ON. THESE PENALTIES THAT SPILL WOULD EXTENDED TO THREE YEARS WHICH WE THINK INVITES ADDITIONAL AND UNNECESSARY LITIGATION. I THINK MISS CURTIS IN PREVIOUS TESTIMONY ON SOME EARLIER BILLS HAS INDICATED. THE DIFFICULT NATURE OF COMPLYING WITH CALIFORNIA'S NUMEROUS. LABOR CODE PROVISIONS WHICH YOU'RE ADDING TO ROUGHLY FIFTY TO SIXTY NEW STATUTES EVERY SESSION LOOKING OVER THE PAST HALF A DOZEN YEARS. AND THERE ARE NUMEROUS COURT DECISIONS ON DEFINING WAGES SO IT'S NOT. A ABUNDANTLY CLEAR IN ALL INSTANCES WHAT IS THE CORRECT DEFINITION OF WAGES AND THEN LASTLY OUR CONCERN. INVOLVING LANGUAGE THAT STATES THE PENALTY IN THIS SECTION CANNOT BE WAIVED BY AGREEMENT OF THE EMPLOYEE AND WE THINK THAT THAT WILL LIKELY PRECLUDE. THE POSSIBILITIES OF PROMPTING EASY SETTLEMENTS OF THESE TYPES OF DISPUTES SO FOR THAT REASON FOR THOSE REASONS WERE IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS WISHING TO ADD ON IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE COME FORWARD YOUR NAME AFFILIATION AND YOUR POSITION. BIRTHDAY WISHES ARE OPTIONAL. GOOD AFTERNOON SHAUN LUIS AND NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESS ALSO POST.

A ES DE TODAY ONE IN SIXTY EIGHT. I ACCORDING TO A TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN REPORT BY AN EMPLOYMENT FOR YOUNG ADULTS WITH AUTISM IS ESTIMATED AT NINETY PERCENT NATIONWIDE. WHILE MULTIPLE FACTORS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO LOW EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS FOR YOUNG ADULTS WITH ASD A FUNDAMENTAL COMPONENT IS A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE DISABILITY ITSELF.

I FEEL LIKE MY PAST EMPLOYERS. HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF ME. SUCH AS HIRING ME FOR ONE JOB AND THEN ONCE I GET HIRED. GIVE ME AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT JOHN. IT WOULD HAVE HELPED ME IMMENSELY. THE EMPLOYER WOULD HAVE OFFER ME ENCOURAGEMENT. EMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING. IT WOULD ALSO HELP IF THE EMPLOYER WOULD HAVE FAITH IN ME AND WILL EVEN ME.

THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU NEXT UP WE RECOGNIZE ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE WHO IS HERE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY ONE. WELCOME SOME A MEMBER STILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THERE IS A SITUATION. THAT WE'RE THIS BILL LAST THE AGRICULTURAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD TO ADDRESS AND THAT IS. THERE ARE TIMES WHEN FARMWORKERS HAVE VOTED ON RATIFIED PUT TOGETHER A CONTRACTS. AND HAVE GONE THROUGH MEDIATION PROCESS WITH THE GROWERS AND YET SEE SEEMS THAT IN A NUMBER OF CASES IT CAN TAKE DECADES TO GET. BACK ON TRACK ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED AND WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS THAT ASK TAYLOR BE TO LOOK AT THE SITUATION. SEE WHAT THE SCOPE OF IT IS AND THEN COME BACK IN AND GO THROUGH ITS REGULATIONS ITS RULE MAKING PROCESS. TO WITH SOME REAL EIGHT. METHODS TO TRY AND ADDRESS THE ISSUE THAT'S WHAT THE BILL DOES AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR ALBUMS. THANK YOU WE WELCOME YOUR FIRST WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MARIO MARTINEZ SOME THE GENERAL COUNSEL FOR THE UNITED FARM WORKERS. I WON I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. THE UFW SUPPORTS AB TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY ONE. DESPITE THE PASSAGE OF THE MANDATORY MEDIATION LINE TWO THOUSAND TWO. DELAY REMAINS ONE OF THE MAJOR ROADBLOCKS FOR FARMWORKERS TO FULLY REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF THE FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS THAT THEY ONE OFTEN. DECADES AGO. AS YOU MAY RECALL MANDATORY MEDIATION WAS ENACTED AFTER EMPLOYERS REFUSE TO AGREE TO A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT. FOLLOWING A VOTE TO HAVE UNION REPRESENTATION BY FARMWORKERS. IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT BACK MANDATORY MEDIATION LA WAS RECENTLY UPHELD BY THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT. AS CONSTITUTIONAL. THE PROBLEM WE'RE DEALING WITH THIS THAT THE LENGTH OF TIME IT TAKES FOR A MEDIATION DECISION BY THE BOARD TO BECOME BY DEAN. CAN BE THE RESULT OF. LEGAL MANEUVERING AND CONTINUED DELAY BY EMPLOYERS AS WELL AS THE RESULT OF. ENFORCEMENT LOOPHOLES WITHIN THE AGRICULTURAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT. WHILE THE PROCESS BETWEEN THE MEDIATOR AND THEY'LL ARE BE A STRAIGHT FORWARD UNDER THE MANDATORY MEDIATION LAW. A COURT CAN STAY THE MEDIATION ORDER INDEFINITELY. WITHOUT EXPLAINING THE REASONING FOR THE STAY OR WITHOUT AN AVERAGE EVIDENTIARY PROCESS. THAT ESTABLISHES IF A PARTY WOULD STOP FOR SOME TYPE OF HARM IF THEY IMPLEMENTED THE AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION EMPLOYERS ROUTINELY REFUSED TO FOLLOW THE TERMS. ORDERED THROUGH THE MEDIATION PROCESS WHILE THEIR APPEAL IS PENDING. AB TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY ONE WOULD REQUIRE THE ELLERBEE TO STUDY THE ISSUE OF DELAY AND IDENTIFY ANY ENFORCEMENT LOOPHOLES IN THE TWO THOUSAND TWO LAW. SUCH AS WHEN THEY A LAWYER BE IS UNABLE TO ACTUALLY ENFORCE THE MEDIATOR'S DECISION. THIS WILL HELP PREVENT CASES TAKING TWENTY FOUR YEARS AS WAS WITH BASS TOMATO BEFORE FARMWORKERS RECEIVED THE RIGHTS AND BENEFITS. UNDER THE LAW THAT IT WAS INTENDED TO HAVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL WITNESSES. IF YOU. OTHERS WISHING TO ADD ON IN SUPPORT. MARK SCHACHT CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION AT SUPPORT. THANK YOU OTHERS WISHING AT ON IN SUPPORT. SHANE GUSMAN ON BEHALF OF THE TEAMSTERS IN SPORTS THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO ADD ON IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY ONE. I SEEN NINE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. SEEING NO OPPOSITION OUTSIDE TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY THANK YOU FIRST I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE BELL. THANK YOU. SECOND AND AND I I JUST LIKE TO TO NOTE THAT TO. THAT I REMEMBER THE DEBATE. TWO THOUSAND. TO. FIFTEEN YEARS AGO THAT MARCHES UP AND DOWN THE VALLEY TRYING TO GET THEN GOVERNOR DAVIS TO SIGN THIS BILL. AND IT WASN'T THOUGHT TO BE A PANACEA BUT THE IDEA WAS IT WOULD BRING ABOUT SOME. JUSTICE FOR SOME OF THESE. SOME OF THESE. WINS FOR THE FARM WORKERS IN THE AREA WITH WHERE THEY GOT A LEGAL. CONTRACT AND THEY JUST HAD ESSENTIALLY EMPLOYERS GUARDS SITTING ON THEIR HANDS AND SO. THAT WAS THE NOTION IS BILL AND. I THINK IT HASN'T LIVED UP TO TO ITS ITS INTENT AND SO I THINK THIS IS NEEDED AT THE MINIMUM. TO FOCUS ON HOW HOW WE CAN BRING ABOUT SOME CONCLUSION TO THESE. FAIR ELECTIONS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FOR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SOME MOMENTUM MCCARTY ANYONE ELSE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SEEING NINE SO I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE I ESPERANDO. IT'S BILL HAS A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL THANK YOU. MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS THURMAN AYE THURMAN AYE FLORA.

NEXT SYRIA CALL SOME MEMBERS WOULD MEAN WHO IS HERE TO PRESENT AB NIGHT YOU KNOW TO IN AB TWENTY THREE THIRTY EIGHT. YEAH RIGHT VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR IF YOU MAY I. AGREE I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY THREE THIRTY EIGHT IT'S EYEWITNESSES I WITH SOME FLIGHTS AND I'D LIKE TO HELP THEM GET ON THEIR WAY LEAD ATTY. THANK YOU SO MUCH I TODAY OF MYSTERY MEMBERS ARE PERCENT AB TWENTY THREE THIRTY EIGHT WHICH WILL REQUIRE TALENT AGENCIES TO MAKE EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION RETALIATION. NUTRITION AND EATING ORDERS EATING DISORDERS AVAILABLE TO ITS ARTISTS. THE BILL REQUIRES TALENT AGENCIES TO TRAIN THEIR EMPLOYEES ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION WILL ALSO REQUIRE THE LABOR COMMISSIONER TO PROVIDE MINERS. AND THE MINERS PARENTS FOR LEGAL GUARDIAN WITH TRAINING AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION RETALIATION REPORTING RESOURCES NUTRITION. AND EATING DISORDERS WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS. FROM THE VERY BEGINNING ON THIS BILL AS YOU MAY RECALL IN JANUARY AND PRIOR TO THAT. AND TO ENSURE THAT WE ALL WORK TOGETHER TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES THIS LEGISLATION IS NEEDED. AS MUCH AS EVER. AS YOU ARE AWARE OF RECENT SCANDALS EMERGING FROM THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY TO EMPOWER POTENTIAL VICTIMS WITH INFORMATION HELP THEM IDENTIFY AND SEEK RESOURCES. FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS INTRODUCED PROFESSIONALS ARE PROTECTED AND KEEP A KEPT SAFE IN THE WORKING ENVIRONMENT. HERE WITH ME TODAY ARE KAREN STORE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ASSOCIATION OF TALENT AGENTS INCUR CHRISTENSEN NO THE SENIOR DIRECTOR OF STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS FROM THE NATIONAL EATING DISORDERS ASSOCIATION. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS CHRIS SINCE NOW AND I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL EATING DISORDERS ASSOCIATION OR NITA. TO EXPRESS OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY THREE THIRTY EIGHT. THANK YOU TO ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE TODAY. ON BEHALF OF NEED AT THE LARGEST ORGANIZATION THAT SUPPORTS FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS AFFECTED BY EATING DISORDERS I AM PROUD TO SUPPORT AB TWENTY THREE THIRTY EIGHT WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THAT TRAINING AND EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION. RETALIATION NUTRITION AND EATING DISORDERS BE PROVIDED TO EMPLOYEES AND ARTISTS OF TALENT AGENCIES. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER MARC LEVINE FOR HIS SPONSORSHIP AND LEADERSHIP IN THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT THIS LEGISLATION WOULD HELP PREVENT BOTH SEXUAL HARASSMENT INTHE PREVALENCE OF EATING DISORDERS AND THE FASHION AND ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRIES. NEARLY THIRTY MILLION AMERICANS WILL SUFFER FROM AN EATING DISORDER AT SOME POINT IN THERE LIFE IN CALIFORNIA THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE CURRENTLY STRUGGLING WITH AN EATING DISORDER IS ESTIMATED TO BE OVER ONE MILLION. EVEN JUST EATING DISORDERS CAN AND DO AFFECT PEOPLE OF ALL GENDERS RACES AGES AND SOCIO ECONOMIC BACKGROUNDS. EATING DISORDERS SUCH AS ANOREXIA NERVOSA BINGE EATING DISORDER AND BULIMIA NERVOSA ARE COMPLEX MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS WHICH LEAD TO CHRONIC HEALTH COMPLETELY CMPLICATIONS. AND HAVE THE HIGHEST MORTALITY RATE OF ANY MENTAL ILLNESS FOR FEMALES BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD WHO SUFFER FROM ANOREXIA. THE MORTALITY RATE IS TWELVE TIMES HIGHER THAN THE DEATH RATE FROM FOR ALL OTHER CAUSES OF DEATH. MODELS AND OTHERS WITHIN THE FASHION INDUSTRY AND ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRIES EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALLY ELEVATED RISK OF EATING DISORDERS BECAUSE OF EXPECTATIONS PLACED UPON THEM TO MAINTAIN A CERTAIN BODY WEIGHT. FURTHERMORE TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES SUCH AS SEXUAL ASSAULT OR HARASSMENT HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE A SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTOR FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF EATING DISORDERS. RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND THAT WOMEN WHO ARE VICTIMS OF ASSAULT WORK ALMOST TWO TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DEVELOP ANEMIA THAN THOSE WHO HAD NOT BEEN VICTIMIZED. ALTHOUGH QUITE SERIOUS EATING DISORDERS ARE TREATABLE AND CAN BE PREVENTED ESPECIALLY OF EARLY INTERVENTION EFFORTS ARE ENACTED KNOWING THE SIGNS IS A CRITICAL FIRST STEP. THE EARLIER AN INDIVIDUAL RECEIVES TREATMENT THE GREATER THE CHANCES OF RECOVERY. EARLY IDENTIFICATION AND TREATMENT HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE THE SPEED OF RECOVERY REDUCE SYMPTOMS TO A GREATER EXTENT AND IMPROVE THE LIKELIHOOD OF STAYING FREE OF THE ILLNESS. EARLY INTERVENTION EDUCATION INITIATIVE SUCH AS THOSE LAID OUT IN AB TWENTY THREE THIRTY EIGHT CAN TRULY SAVE LIVES WE BELIEVE THAT THE DISTRIBUTION OF THESE EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS WOULD HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT IN THE PREVENTION OF BOTH SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND EATING DISORDERS IN THE FASHION AND ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRIES. THE REQUIREMENTS LAID OUT IN AB TWENTY THREE THIRTY EIGHT ARE LONG OVERDUE AND IT IS TIME THAT WE WORK TOGETHER TO IMPLEMENT THESE IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS. YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE CALIFORNIA LEADER IN PROTECTING MODELS AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE FASHION AND ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRIES FROM THESE DANGEROUS ILLNESSES WE STRONGLY URGE YOU TO SUPPORT AB TWENTY THREE THIRTY EIGHT THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. SUCH A PLEASURE TO BE HERE AGAIN I'M GONNA MISS COMING UP ON THIS BILL. I'M KAREN STEWART ON THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ASSOCIATION OF TALENT EIGHT TEN CHAIRMAN THURMAN MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TO SPEAK TODAY. I HAVE WE HAVE WORKED VERY HARD WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVINE. AND I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY THREE THIRTY EIGHT OF I WAS JUST TELLING THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT. IT'S IT'S BEEN A TOUGH ROAD. IT'S HARD TO MAKE SOME OF THESE CHANGES BUT THEY'RE IMPORTANT CHANGES. THIS LEGISLATION WILL REQUIRE LICENSE TALENT AGENTS TO MAKE AVAILABLE TO ARTISTS CLIENTS APPROVED EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS REGARDING SEXUAL HARASSMENT. AND HEALTHY EATING AND EATING DISORDER PREVENTION. AND WE WILL WORK WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER AND OTHERS TO CREATE THOSE APPROVED UP MATERIALS TO MAKE THEM AVAILABLE. WE REPRESENT OVER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE TALENT AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA THEY REPRESENT THOUSANDS IF NOT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ARTISTS. THIS IS REALLY MODEL LEGISLATION AND IT WILL BE ONE OF A KIND LEGISLATION WE'RE PROUD TO SUPPORT IT. IT ALSO REQUIRES AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAID THE LABOR COMMISSIONER TO ENSURE THAT MINERS AND GUARDIANS RECEIVE APPROPRIATE SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION TRAINING. AND OTHER TRAINING FOR A NUTRITIONAL TRAINING BEFORE THEIR GRANTED A WORK PERMIT. AND I THINK THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT ELEMENT HERE I THINK THAT MINORS IN OUR INDUSTRY REALLY TO LACK THAT INFORMATION AND THAT KNOWLEDGE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER AND OTHER INDUSTRY EXPERTS. TO HELP WITH THAT MATERIAL TOGETHER. WE'RE HERE AT SUPPORT WE THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVINE YOU. AND ALL OF THE AUTHORS OF THE BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO ADD ON IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. SAYING THAT THERE'S NO OPPOSITION I WANT TO CONGRATULATE ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS IN HIS ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEVINE I DO REMEMBER THIS BILL WHEN YOU CAME HERE IN JANUARY AND. NO ONE WAS SMILING AT THE TABLE LIKE YOU ARE NOW SO WANNA THANK YOU FOR YOUR HARD WORK TOGETHER. AND. GLAD THAT YOU ALL WERE ABLE TO REACH AN AGREEMENT ON WHAT YOU DESCRIBED. AS MODEL LEGISLATION AND I. THANK YOU AND. THEY TURN TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO SEE IF THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SOME AMERICANS ALL FLETCHER THINK IT LIKE TO HAVE THE BELL THAT AND I WANNA THANK YOU MISTER LEVINE I MEAN AND HOPE THAT WE HAVE HAD SO MANY CONVERSATIONS. ANNA IT TAKES A LOT TO GET THIS KIND OF AGREEMENT SELL. YOU HAVE. EARN YOUR STRIPES ON THIS BILL SO I'M THINK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR FOR EVERYBODY COMING TOGETHER AND. DOING REALLY WHAT'S BEST FOR THEIR WORK AND THE SINCE THE WHERE I MEAN THE WORKERS BUT. I'M IMPRESSED I'M IMPRESSED YOU DID IT YEAH SOMETIMES I THINK THAT OUR JOB CONVINCING MAYBE EIGHTY ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND AND SOME SENATORS TO TO AGREE ON SOMETHING WE DON'T NEED TO GET ALL OF THEM BUT. YOU KNOW I REALLY CREDIT MS STEWART FOR WORKING WITH HER ASSOCIATION AND DIED THE RINGLING THAT HAS TO BE INVOLVED IN THAT AS WELL. AND I THINK THAT THE INSPIRATION AND MORAL SUPPORT FROM NIDA.

FLORA I GONZALEZ FLETCHER GONZALEZ FLETCHER AYE JONES SAWYER JONES SAWYER AYE KALRA. KALRA AYE MCCARTY MATHIS. MATHIS I. YOU BILLS UP YOU REGULATIONS. THANK YOU. IT'S ANYONE SO A BILL A BE NICE NOT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TODAY I PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL NINETEEN NO TWO WHICH WILL REQUIRE COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE VALUED OVER ONE BILLION DOLLARS TO PAY SUB CONTRACTED SERVICE WORKERS WAGES TIED. DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT'S INCOME LEVELS FOR THE COUNTYTHEY WORK IN. MAJOR CORPORATIONS ARE MAKING IMMENSE PROFITS AND A REWARDING SKILLS CERTAIN SKILLSETS WITH HIGH WAGES BETTER UNDERVALUING SERVICE WORKERS CORPORATIONS ARE CONTRACTING OUT SERVICE LABOR. LEAVING THESE WORKERS WITHOUT TODD THAT BENEFITS OF BEING. AN EMPLOYEE AND INCLUDES STUFF SUCH AS SECURITY GUARDS BUS DRIVERS CUSTODIAL STAFF TO SERVICE WORKERS AND MORE. SINCE THESE WORKERS NOT HAVE BENEFITS FOR WAGES THAT FULL TIME EMPLOYEES RECEIVE SUBCONTRACTED SERVICE WORKERS FACE MANY OBSTACLES IN ACCESSING OPPORTUNITIES TO FURTHER AND SECURE THEIR FUTURES FOR THEMSELVES. AND OUR FAMILIES THIS LEGISLATION WILL PROVIDE SUBCONTRACTED WORKERS THE UPWARD MOBILITY THEY NEED TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES. AND PLAN FOR THEIR FUTURES ASPIRIN AIBO. THANK YOU THAT WITNESSES TO CALL FOR. VERY GOOD A ANYONE WISHING TO. ADD ON IN EXPRESSED SUPPORT TO THIS BILL. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JENNIFER BROWN TO HAVE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS PROPOSAL. AYE WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE. BROAD AUTHORITY THIS PROVIDES FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS ONE TO VALUE THE OF VALUE OF THE CORPORATION. AND THEIR ABILITY TO ASSESS THAT VALUE BASED UPON A WHATEVER. AYE ASSETS THE COMPANY MAY HAVE BEEN WE'RE NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT THEY WOULD CONSIDER. THE VALUE OF THE STOCK EXCHANGE WHAT STOCK EXCHANGE THEY WOULD ACTUALLY LOOK AT HOW THEY WOULD ADD VALUE THAT AT ANY GIVEN TIME DURING THE YEAR BECAUSE THAT VALUATION OBVIOUSLY COULD GO UP AND DOWN BASED UPON THEIR STOCK PRICE. AND HOW THEY EVEN MAKE THAT ASSESSMENT FOR PURPOSES DETERMINING WHETHER THEY'RE COVERED AND THE MANDATE OF THIS BILL WILL HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE DIR AS I'M EXTENSIVE AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE WHAT THE AREA INCOME IS WHICH IS UNDEFINED IN THE BILL RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT THAT MEANS. OR WHO THAT WOULD INCLUDE AND WHAT PROFESSIONS THAT WOULD INCLUDE IS THAT THE GEOGRAPHICAL AREA AND ARE WE BRINGING AND PROFESSION UP PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE WITH ADVANCED SKILLS TRAINING AND EDUCATION WHO DO HAVE A HIGHER WAGE. AND COMPARING THEM FOR PURPOSES OF THESE PERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACTS IT ALSO GIVES THE IDEA OR A SENSE OF AUTHORITY TO ADD. ADDITIONAL. OCCUPATIONS WITHIN THE DEFINITION OF PERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACT AND WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH REGARDS TO HOW WHAT THIS WOULD DO FOR PURPOSES OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS IN THOSE INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES WHO HAVE THESE CONTRACTS IF YOU PRICES CONTRACTS AT SUCH A HIGH LEVEL. THAT IT'S NO LONGER COST EFFICIENT FOR THESE COMPANIES TO CONTRACT FOR THAT YOU WILL GET A SOME IN HOUSE BUT IT WILL BE PROBABLY A ONE FOR ONE RATIO WHERE YOU'RE BRINGING ON ALL THE CONTRACTORS IN HOUSE SINCE WE HAVE A CONCERN. WITH THE IMPACT THIS WOULD HAVE ON THOSE COMPANIES WHO ARE PROVIDING THE SERVICES AND THEIR ABILITY TO SUSTAIN SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED. THANK YOU OTHERS WISHING TO ADD ON EXPRESS OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON SHAUN KNOWS THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESS REPRESENTS SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ALSO POST. THANK YOU. ANGER WITH CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION ALSO POST MAKE YOU ANY OTHER OPPOSITION. SAY NONE TRYING TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SEE NINE. IS OUR MOTION. THERE'S QUESTIONS I REMEMBER KALRA. THANK YOU. AM SO THAT YOU KNOW ACTUALLY. OTHER I APPLAUD YOU FOR THE GOALS OF THE BILL AND I THINK THAT. THERE'S STILL SOME RETURNEES BE DONE I THINK I THINK. WE RECOGNIZE THAT. I'M. THEN SO I GUESS WHAT THAT THERE'S STILL A GIVEN THE FACT THEY'RE STILL. TO QUESTION WHAT WOULD BE YOUR NEXT STEP IN TERMS OF TRYING TO. BUT THE MORE PARAMETERS ON THE BILL THAT I THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL LOVE FOR US TO KNOW IN ORDER TO. ASSURE THAT THINK YOU VERY MUCH SCARRY PREACHER THE QUESTION. THE THE AREA INCOME IS DEFINED BY HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FOR THE COUNTY THAT IS THE THE LOCUS OF THE WORK IT'S BEEN. PRETTY CLEARLY DEFINE THE INCOME LEVEL IS NOT. AND THAT SIMPLY TO ENGAGE THE STAKEHOLDERS OTHER NOT GOING TO GET ENGAGED IF DEMOCRATS DISAPPEAR. AND AREN'T HERE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AND THE BILL JUST FOUNDERS WHERE IT STARTS ON. THEY THEY NEED TO COME TO THE TABLE TO SAY WELL WHAT IS THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF MONEY TO PAY PEOPLE FOR. A SET OF SKILLS THAT IS REALLY ON. LOOK DOWN UPON YOU CELEBRATE. STEM SKILLS BUT YOU SAY THAT IF YOU ARE AN IMMIGRANT AND YOU'RE A JANITOR. THAT YOU CAN NEVER BE ANYTHING ELSE. THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT THEY'VE DONE. THERE WAS AN ARTICLE IN YOUR TIMES. LAST YEAR ABOUT A JANITOR AT KODAK AT WORK IN ROCHESTER NEW YORK IN THE EIGHTIES. SHE HAD. FULL TIME WORK. AND AMOUNT OF PAY AND VACATION TIME AND EDUCATION BENEFITS INTRINSICALLY TO GO TO SCHOOL SHOULD NEVER BECOME THE CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER. OF KODAK IN ROCHESTER NEW YORK IN THE EIGHTIES EVEN TALKED ABOUT IMMIGRANT. JANITOR AT APPLE IN CUPERTINO IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. MAKING INFLATION ADJUSTED. THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY FROM THE EIGHTIES IN ROCHESTER. WITH NO BENEFITS NO RUNG IN THE LADDER. EVER CLIMB UP AND GET HERSELF OUT OF WORKING POVERTY. AND THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT WE'VE GOT. THREE COMPANIES THAT DO GREAT THINGS AND THEY DON'T DO JANITORIAL WORK PRETTY WELL. SO THEY GOING CONTRACT OUT FOR THE CHEAPEST JANITORIAL WORK POSSIBLE WHICH MEANS THAT IT DEPRESSES WAGES. AND THEN YOU'VE GOT PEOPLE. OUT WORKING FOR VERY LITTLE THAT CAN NEVER LIVE ANYWHERE NEAR WHERE THEY WORK WHOSE KIDS CAN'T EVER GO TO SCHOOL ANYWHERE AND DON'T HAVE. A FUTURE AHEAD OF THEM THAT'S BETTER THAN WHAT THEY'VE GOT. SO WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO ACTUALLY ADVANCE THE CAUSE. OF. O. WORKING POOR THAT'S ESSENTIALLY. AND I I THINK I PROBABLY TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS BEFORE IT AT A NEW CASTE SYSTEM. OF UNTOUCHABLES THAT WILL NEVER BE A PART OF OUR COMMUNITY BECAUSE WE PAY THEM SO LITTLE THAT THEY CAN NEVER. GET ARE UP AYE IN IN PURSUING SECURITY FOR THEIR FAMILY AND AND WHAT WE ALL THINK OF AS AS THE AMERICAN DREAM THE CALIFORNIA TREAT WITCHES YOUR CHILDREN AND YOUR GRANDCHILDREN HAVE A BETTER LIFE THAN YOU HAVE. WELL LOU THANK YOU AND AS I INDICATED AND. YOU KNOW I THINK THE GOAL NOT JUST THE GOAL BUT I THINK THE PREMISE IS ABSOLUTELY VALID. HAVING GROWN UP IN IN SAN JOSE AND SILICON VALLEY IN HAVING. GROWN UP. WITHIN A BIKE RIDE OF IBM'S A BUS BECAUSE HEADQUARTERS WHICH IS NO LONGER THERE BUT THE TIME. REALLY LIFTED UP SO MANY IN THE COMMUNITY I DO THINK I DON'T THINK IT'S UNIQUE. THE TO ANY WELL ONE INDUSTRY I THINK THAT THE PART OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE SEEN. THIS ISSUE A CONTRACT NOT NOT DOES OF OF TIME DETACHMENT FROM CERTAIN ASPECTS OF WORK. AS OPPOSED EVERYONE HAVING THE SAME BADGER ONE CAN OF BOB LOOKING UBER BEGINNING TO GET A COMPARTMENT SAME TEAM AND WE'VE SEEN SOME. PROBLEMS THAT IT WAS HARD AND PART OF IT HAS BEEN THROUGH ORGANIZING. BUT I THINK THAT I THINK THAT THERE'S BEEN BENEFITS TO IT FOR EXAMPLE APPLE BRING IN THIS COLLAPSES AND HOUSE. I THINK JUST THE VALUE OF HISTORY OF SNOBBY I'M AN APPLE EMPLOYEE THAT BY ITSELF. I THINK IS PART OF. WHAT? ALLOW CERTAIN I'D BECOME SO COULD I THIS PRIDE AIM IN BEING PART OF SOMETHING. THAT THAT IS GLOBALLY RECOGNIZED AND AND SO I ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY HERE. AND I'M HAPPY TO MAKE A MOTIONS OF THAT YOU CAN CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT OPPORTUNITY I DO THINK THERE'S A LOT OF. QUESTIONS AS SOME OF THE DETAILS. BUT. I ALSO KNOW THAT. THERE IS. HOWEVER THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERYONE TO COME TO THE TABLE TO. TURN A GOOD JUDGE OF RECOGNIZE THIS VALUE OF WORK TO RECOGNIZE THE VALUE OF WORK THAT. BUT COMPANIES ARE DOING AMAZING THINGS AND THERE ARE CREATING ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF WEALTH THAT I'M THERE'S NO OPPORTUNITY FOR ANYONE TO FEEL PART OF IT. UNLESS WE ALL HAVE THE SAME ACCESS AND AMOUNT OF WEALTH BUT THE LEAST FEEL PART OF THAT SUCCESS THAT REALLY CREATIVE SILICON VALLEY THREE OR FOUR DECADES AGO. AYE IN ITS INFANCY SO WITHOUT A DOUBT. A MOOD DEL. BILL'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SEEM NOT TO LIKE CLUB. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. I DO THIS BILL DOES HAVE DO PASS RECOMMENDATION FROM THE CHAIR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS THURMOND AYE THURMAN AYE FLORA. FLORA NO GONZALEZ FLETCHER GONZALEZ FLETCHER AYE JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER AYE KALRA. KALRA AYE MCCARTY. MATHIS. MATHIS NO. BUT BILLS OUT THE REGULATIONS MRS PROGRESS THANK YOU. KAREN MEMBERS. IF YOU. RECOGNIZE ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON IS PRESENT WE A WHO IS REPRESENTING THREE BILLS TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN OUT. AND MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY OF PRESENTING THAT THE THREE BELLS. WITH A VERY UP BRIEF LITTLE PREMISE. WHATEVER YOUR. INCLINATION MAY BE WITH RESPECT TO THESE BILLS. AND WHATEVER YOUR. GENERALIZED PERCEPTION MIGHT BE OF. CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE IT THAT WITH FARM WORKERS IN THE FIELDS. THESE ARE FARMWORKERS. UP AND DOWN THE STATE. I ASK THAT YOU HEAR THEM. AND LISTEN TO THEIR CONCERNS. THESE BILLS. ARE AN EFFORT. TO PUT THEIR CONCERNS INTO. SUB MUCH CHANGES THAT RECOGNIZES. THE AREAS THAT THEY THEY THINK NEEDS WHO NEED TO BE IMPROVED. I IN MANY WAYS THIS MAY OF. BLIND THE FACE OF CONDUCT INVENTION OF WISDOM AND POINTS OF VIEW. BUT THEY ARE. HONESTLY AND LEGITIMATELY HELD BY THE INDIVIDUALS YOU'LL BE HEARING FROM. FOR THE REASONS AND THE PURPOSES THAT ARE. BEFORE YOU TODAY. WE HAVE FARMWORKERS HERE FROM COMMENT READ LEAVE ELAINE NO RICH GROW BY SALIA SALINAS. OVER A HUNDRED NOT ALL WILL LINE UP. AT SOME HAVE TO GO BACK HOME. BUT THEY ARE REPRESENTATIVE. OF A VERY DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW IN A VERY DIFFERENT REALITY THEIR. AND I'M ASKING. AS WE PRESENT THE BILL'S. OF FOR THE COURTESY OF UP. YOUR ATTENTION TO THESE INDIVIDUALS THIS IS A. IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO BE HEARD AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT I WOULD SAY THAT I KNOW THAT EVERYONE WILL BE HEARD TO DATE THIS COMMITTEE WELCOMES ALL PERSPEX AND STAN AND WE MAY NOT ALL AGREE BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS COMMITTEE CARES ABOUT. HELPING WORKING PEOPLE EVERYONE WILL BE HEARD EVERYONE IS WELCOME. I'M WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO BEGIN WITH AB THIRTY NINETY TWO YES. PLEASE PROCEED AND AND AGAIN THE PREMISE WAS NOT TO SUGGEST THAT THAT'S NOT THE CASE BUT WE ARE IN AN AREA THAT IS A BIT UNUSUAL WITH RESPECT TO WHAT. FARMWORKERS AND THEIR THEIR POINTS OF VIEW AND THEIR AND THEIR NEEDS OUT THERE AND. WITH THAT. WILL INTRODUCE THE THE BILL'S AND AND AND HEAR FROM THOSE WHO. WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE MOB MOVED FORWARD. CALIFORNIA LAW ESTABLISHES THE RIGHT OF AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYEES TO FORM JOIN OR ASSIST LABOR ORGANIZATIONS. THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ACTIVITIES WITH AGRICULTURAL AND EMPLOYERS REGARDING WAGES WORK CONDITIONS ARE OTHER ASPECTS OF EMPLOYMENT. HOWEVER CURRENT LAW GOVERNING AGRICULTURAL RELATIONS IS SILENT. ON INSTANCES WHEN A LABOR ORGANIZATION WINS AN ELECTION FOR THE IGHT TO REPRESENT A GROUP OF WORKERS. BUT THEN IN THE OPINION OF. FARM WORKERS DISAPPEARS. AB THREE ZERO NINE TWO REQUIRES THE LRB. THE NULLIFY A UNION CONTRACT IF THE UNION ABANDONS THE WORKERS. FOR A PERIOD OF THREE. OR MORE YEARS. IN MY DISTRICT AND IN OTHER PARTS OF CALIFORNIA THERE ARE GROUPS OF WORKERS. WHO HAVE BEEN ABANDONED? BY THE UNIONS THAT THEY VOTED FOR. IN SOME CASES MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS AGO. THE WORKERS THERE TODAY WERE NOT PART OF THE DECISION MAKING NOT PART OF THE VOTE. WE'RE NOT EVEN EMPLOYED AT THE TIME. AND THEY RESPECT. SPEC FULLY REQUEST THAT THE UNION EARNED THE RIGHT TO REPRESENT THEM. NOT SIMPLY HAVE A CONTRACT FORCED UPON THEM. AND WAGES THAT THEY HAD NOTHING TO SAY. OR HAVE INPUT AND WITH RESPECT TO. TO THEIR PAYCHECKS. SO THIS BILL WOULD OFFER PROTECTIONS AGAINST THIS PRACTICE. THIS BILL WOULD MAKE IT SO THAT ANY AGRICULTURAL LABOR ORGANIZATION THAT ABANDONS FOR LONGER THAN THREE YEARS THE WORKERS IT WAS ELECTED TO SERVE. WITH THEM LOSE ITS CERTIFICATION AND RIGHT TO REPRESENT THE BARGAINING UNIT. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND EXPLAIN THE NEED FOR THE BILL. SILVIA LOPEZ AND JESSIE ROHA. HI YEAH. ON MY NAME IS SYLVIA LOPEZ AND I'M A FARMWORKERS FROM FRESNO COUNTY. MEN MY WHOLE FAMILY WORKS AT THAT THE FEEL SINCE. WE CAME TO UNITED STATES FOR A DREAM THAT. THE MY DAD SAID THAT HE. IN THE UNITED STATES WILL RESPECT US. LIKE THEY COULDN'T DO IT IN MEXICO COULD THAT'S WAY OUT I'M HERE TODAY. I THINK YOU GUYS TO. TO BE HERE AND. I BELIEVE IS A HARD. POSITION TO TO BE THERE AND LISTEN TO A LOT OF THINGS THAT IS. GOING OUT THERE. I AM HERE AND I SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE WE BE SUFFERING. ARM IN THIS AREA AND. FRESNO COUNTY. SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TALL. SOMETIMES I THINK THAT THIS NEVER GONNA END. BUT THEN I LOOK AT TUNE NORTH. HERE'S SACRAMENTO AND I THINK. AND I THINK THE CAPITAL IT IS FOR SOMETHING I THINK IS THERE BECAUSE MAYBE IT'S A HOPE THAT ONE DAY THEIR WORD LISTEN TO US AND HELP US IN. AND AND TO BE HEARD. ARM. I WAS WITNESS THE A LOT OF A LOT OF THINGS HAPPEN TO US THERE MORE WE ARE MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND FARM WORKERS AND THIS AREA FRESNO AREA. THAT WOULD BE SUFFERING. BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T WE HAVEN'T BE HEARD. AND. TODAY I CAME HERE WITH A LOT A WHOLE ENDS. IN A MOMENT I FEEL THAT. I'M JUST WASTING MY TIME. BUT THEN I THINK THEN I REMEMBER THOSE OF THOSE THREE THOUSAND MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND FARM WORKERS OUT THERE. THEIR KIDS THEIR FAMILIES AND THAT'S WHY GIVE ME STRAIGHT TO BE HERE IN FRONT OF YOU GUYS. AND ASSUMING THAT YOU GUYS HERE'S. ASSUMING THAT YOU GUYS ARE HERE FOR US FARMWORKERS IMMIGRANTS MEXICANS PANIC. AND THAT GAVE ME THE HOPE AGAIN TO BE HERE FRONT OF YOU GUYS TODAY I BEEN HERE BEFORE. INVEST SUPPORT THIS THIS LA BECAUSE. I'M THE UNITED FARM WORKERS THEY ABOUNDED THOSE THIS WORKERS WANTED TWENTY YEARS IN. I THINK THAT'S JUST NOT RIGHT. AND. ONE OF MY. MY PARENTS DREAMS THIS. THAT. THEY TOLD US THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE RESPECT LIKE. HUMAN IN THIS COUNTRY. HAD THAT'S ONE OF THE REASON THAT I'M HERE TODAY. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS THANK YOU. JUST A ROBUST SPOKESPERSON FOR PIC JUSTICE THAT THE VOICE OF THE NINETY NINE PERCENT OF FARM WORKERS IN THE STATE. SO AB THREE ZERO NINE TWO. THE OLD THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES AT A LARGE A PEACH BERMAN FRESNO COUNTY. FOR MANY YEARS NOW HAVE BEEN EARNING AT THE HIGHEST INDUSTRY WAGES IN FACT SOME OF THEM EARN MORE THAN A SCHOOL TEACHER. AYE WHEN SUDDENLY THIS UNION ODD THAT DISAPPEAR FOR TWENTY YEARS BACK. YOU KNOW THEY COME BACK TO FORCED ITSELF ON THE WORKERS WHICH MOST OF THEM ARE NOT EVEN BORN BACK IN THE NINETIES. THE UNION TO THE WORKERS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THEIR MONEY THREE PERCENT OF THEIR WAGES TO THE UNION. OR THEY WOULD BE FIRED IF THEY DIDN'T. A CONTRACT. WITHOUT LETTING THE EMPLOYEE SEE IT REVIEW IT OR VOTE FOR IT OUGHT TO FOURTEEN IS WORKERS. ARE YOU KNOW THE CONTRACT WOULD ACTUALLY LOWER THEIR PAY AND ON TOP OF THAT IT WAS STRIPPED THEM OF THE RIGHT TO PROTEST WHICH I THINK THE CIVIL. RIGHT FUNDAMENTAL A RIGHT IN THIS COUNTRY. THEY'LL ARE BE EVEN ADMITTED HIMSELF THAT THE UNION HAD DISAPPEAR BECAUSE THEY HAD NO WAY TO PROVE THAT THEY'VE EVER SEND THE FATS A TELEGRAM OR EVEN SMOKE SIGNALS AND OF TWENTY YEARS. BUT THE ELLERBEE SET THE LAW DID IN OUR. ALLOW THEM TO RECOGNIZE ABANDONMENT. IT'S PRETTY DISTURBING IT'S LIKE IMAGININGS SEIU ABANDONING THE HUNDREDS OF WORKERS IN THIS CAPITAL IN THIS BUILDING. NEVER RATIFYING A CONTRACT NEVER NEGOTIATING ON THE TABLE. HE MET OF THE CHAOS THERE WELL THAT'S HAPPENED FARMWORKERS ACROSS THE STATE. SO FOR THE SAKE OF THOUSANDS OF REAL FARMWORKERS THE NINETY NINE PERCENT IMMIGRANT LATINO FARM WORKERS THAT CAME TO THIS COUNTRY. SCAPIN MEDICAL LIKE MYSELF.

MY NAME IS FERNANDO AND I'M HERE TO SUPPORT THE A. B. VERY NAY TO. THANK THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO ADD ON IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. COME FORWARD. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS MARIO MARTINEZ ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED FARM WORKERS IN OPPOSITION TO IT A. B. THIRTY NINETY TWO. I DID WANT TO CORRECT SOME SERIOUS. MISINFORMATION AND FRANKLY THIS HONESTY. ABOUT. STATE OF THE LAW. THE AUTHOR. TOLD EVERYONE HERE TODAY THAT THE LAW IS SILENT ON THIS ISSUE. THAT IS FALSE. BUT IT'S PAUL. THE LAW IS NOT SIGNED. FOR ALMOST FOUR DECADES. VARIOUS. MEMBERS OF THE AGRICULTURAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD. GOING BACK ALMOST FORTY YEARS. HAVE REJECTED THE QUOTE UNQUOTE ABANDONMENT DEFENSE. BECAUSE IT WOULD PERMIT EMPLOYERS TO REFUSE TO BARGAIN WITH THE UNION SELECTED BY THEIR EMPLOYEES. THAT LA HAS BEEN NOT ONLY APPROVED BY THE COURTS OF APPEAL. BUT RECENTLY. IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION. SEVEN MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT SUPPORTED DOT INTERPRETATION OF THE LAW. FOR THE AUTHOR TO SAY. THAT THE LOT SILENT IT'S FALSE. IT'S FALSE. THIS IDEA OF ABANDONMENT HAS BEEN REJECTED PRECISELY BECAUSE EMPLOYERS REFUSED TO BARGAIN. WITH UNIONS THAT ARE REPRESENTED BY EMPLOYEES. THE LAS VERY CLEAR THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAS APPROVED THIS INTERPRETATION THERE IS NO NEED. I TRY TO CHANGE THAT LAW BECAUSE THE LABOR BOARD HAS EXPERTISE. THE JUSTICES HAVE LOOKED AT THIS ISSUE AND HAVE REJECTED IT. WITH RESPECT TO THE ISSUE OF WORKERS NOT HAVING VOTED. THAT'S THE STATE OF THE LAW WITH ANY LABOR LAW. THE AUTO WORKERS' THAT VOTED FOR UNION REPRESENTATION DECADES AGO. DON'T HAVE TO REVOTE EVERY YEAR TO HAVE. REPRESENTATION. THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS THAT ARE REPRESENTED BY THEIR UNIONS DO NOT HAVE TO VOTE. EVERY YEAR EVEN THOSE THOUGH THOSE ELECTIONS TOOK PLACE DECADES AGO. THAT'S THE SAME PRINCIPLE HERE. THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT RECOGNIZES THAT WHEN EMPLOYEES LEGITIMATELY. WHAT TO DO AWAY WITH THEIR UNION? NOT BECAUSE THEIR EMPLOYERS. FORCING THEM TO OR SUPPORTING THEM TO WHEN EMPLOYEES LEGITIMATELY WANT TO DO AWAY WITH THEIR UNION THERE ARE PROCEDURES THERE IN PLACE. FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES TO USE. TO VOTE OUT THERE UNION. BASED ON THAT THE UNION OPPOSES AB THIRTY NINETY TWO THANK YOU. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MARK SHOCKER CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION IN ABOUT OPPOSITION. MAKE YOU. SECURE MEMBERS MICHAEL YOUNG WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO POST THANK YOU. JESSICA STENDER EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES OPPOSED THANK YOU. INVESTMENT BEHALF OF THE TEAMSTERS OPPOSED. IQ ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE WILL TURN TWO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MISTER CHAIRMAN BACK CLOSE. WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THEN YOU WOULD HAVE KNOWN THEM FOR BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO DRIVE US ABSOLUTELY. SIMILAR GONZALEZ FLETCHER. PATTERSON. Q. DEFINE. AND IN MEN. YES I CAN I ACTUALLY. IT WITH THE A LR BEES OWN DEFINITION OF ABANDONMENT AND I'M QUOTING. A SHOWING. THAT THE UNION WAS UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO REPRESENT THE BARGAINING UNIT. AT AN. THEY ARE BE THEN AGREES WITH YOU THAT THESE WORKERS WERE ABANDONED. NOW AT WHAT I'M WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT YOU'RE GIVING ME A DEFINITION FROM THE A A RP YET THEY ARE BE HAS REJECTED IN THIS CLAIM. AND BROUGHT FORWARD WORKERS GOD BLESS THOSE WORKERS I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT. AND USE YOUR TIME. WHICH. I'M SURE IS UNCOMPENSATED TO COME. TALK TO US BECAUSE I DO VALUE FARMWORKERS A VALUE FARMWORKERS SO MUCH THAT HE CONSISTENTLY. VOTE FOR THEIR WAGES AND BENEFITS TO INCREASE THIS IS NOT A BENEFIT. THAT THIS BILL WOULD DO FOR YOU. BUT I WANT TO BE CLEAR. ANY SUGGESTION THAT WE WHAT'S CHANGED A LOT IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE GROWERS OR ANY OTHER EMPLOYER. TO NOT INANE HONEST WAY BARGAIN WITH THE UNION THAT HAS BEEN CHOSEN. BY WORKERS. IS INCREDULOUS THE THOUGHT THAT WE'D EVEN BRING SOMETHING LIKE THAT FORWARD. TO ENCOURAGE WHAT IS ALREADY STANDARD PRACTICE THROUGHOUT PRIVATE EMPLOYMENT TO NOT BARGAIN AT FIRST CONTRACT IS INSULTING AND THEN TO SOMEHOW SUGGEST THAT ITS ABANDONMENT BY THE VERY PEOPLE WHO WORK SO HARD WITH THOSE WORKERS TO ORGANIZE THEM INTO A UNION TO HAVE A VOICE. I AM SO SORRY. THAT YOUR EMPLOYER HAS SO MISLED YOU ON THIS ISSUE. THAT IS REALLY JUST HEART NOW I AM NOT. ASKING I AM TELLING YOU. I AM SORRY FOR THAT. BUT IT IS INSULTING TO ME AS SOMEBODY WHO SPENT A LOT OF MY LIFE WORKING FOR FARMWORKERS TO SUGGEST SOMEHOW. THAT THAT THIS HELPS FARMWORKERS. IT HELPS UNEMPLOYED HERE. NOT HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THE WILL OF THE WORKERS. BUT I WON'T BE VOTING FOR THIS BILL TO. Q. OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS HOMES ON THE MEMBER MASSERIA'S SOMEONE MISTER ROSS. HAS THANK YOU AND IT'S NOT REALLY A BACK AND FORTH JUST CLARIFICATION FOR THE RECORD YES THEY ARE BE HAS ADMITTED IN MULTIPLE TIMES AND I WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO SUBMIT IT TO YOUR OFFICE MRS GONZALEZ. THAT THEY'VE ADMITTED TO THE ABANDONMENT FAQ YOU JUST HAD THE MARK MARTINEZ HE DID HE SHOW YOU ANY FATS OR ANY SINGLE RECORD THAT THEY DID NOT ABANDON FOR THAT FACT. KNOW THEY'VE NEVER DID. THEY NEVER DISPUTED IN THE FIFTIES RECALL OF APPEALS. THAT NET NAY NEVER DISPUTED IN THE SUPREME COURT. THEY'VE THEY ARE BE THEY NEVER THE SPIRIT TO THEY'LL ARE BEING THAT ALSO NEVER PROVEN THAT WITH ONE SINGLE COMMUNICATION IN THOSE TWENTY YEARS. THE REQUESTED ABANDONMENT YES THEY WERE ABANDONED THEY DON'T EVEN REFUTE THAT THAT THERE WAS NO ATTEMPT TO CHECK EVER BARGAINED FIRST CONTRACT. THAT I DON'T THINK WE'LL CHECK YOU THE ATTORNEY SITTING RIGHT NOW AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS AN ONGOING CASE IN ALLER BEE HAS RULED IN FACULTY ABOUT A MAN'S ON AN ONGOING CASE OKAY AS ARRESTING AND HERE. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ROBUST DISCUSS YES. WE'RE GOING TO DISAGREE AND I'M JUST WE ARE BUT WE'RE GOING TO DO IT. IN A MANNER. THAT AS A YES NOT OF AN APPRECIATE THAT. AGAIN. BEYLERBEY HAS. A DEFINITION. SHOWING THAT THE UNION WERE WAS UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO REPRESENT THE BARGAINING UNIT. AND THERE ARE FACTORS THAT THEY TAKE UNDER CONSIDERATION IF THE UNION SIMPLY CEASES TO COMMUNICATE. WITH THE WORKERS. OR EMPLOYERS MAKES NO ATTEMPT TO ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF THE WORKERS. FOR NUMEROUS YEARS HOW DOES THIS ACTIVITY NOT QUALIFIED. AS ABANDONMENT UNDER THE AARP'S DEFINITION. AND BACK HAS BEEN THE EXPERIENCE THAT THESE FARMWORKERS HAVE HAD. AND THAT WITH THAT. IF THEY HAVE ASK THAT ABANDONMENT BE SOMETHING THAT. THAT WE CONSIDER IN THIS BILL AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE. SUFFICE IT TO SAY THERE IS NOT AGREEMENT. AS IT RELATES TO THE ISSUES OF ABANDONMENT BUT WE APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR POINTS. WE HEAR THE POINT OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS DID YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OF COMET. JUST DONE THEY APPRECIATE. BIG JUSTICE MAKING THE TIME TO TO MAKE IT APPEAR. AND TAKING THE TRIP OUT OF THE FILL. MISTER CHAIRMAN I MOTION WITH THE BILL. SO MOTION IS IS A MOTION AND A SECOND ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION QUESTION OF COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I SEEN THAT SIR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. NOTHING IN THIS BILL PREVENTS A UNION FROM FILING UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE CHARGES FOR AN EMPLOYER FAILING TO NEGOTIATE. HOWEVER IF INSTEAD OF NEGOTIATING. THE UNION DOES IN FACT DISAPPEAR FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. NOT ONLY FAILS TO FILE AN UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE CHARGE WHICH HAS BEEN GOING ON IN THIS CASE. BUT ALSO DOES NOT TAKE ACCESS TO THE THAT INTO THE FIELDS TO CHECK ON THE EMPLOYEES THAT ELECTED IT. DOES NOT FILE GRIEVANCES DOES NOT CALL THE EMPLOYER NOR SEND ANY LETTERS OR EMAILS. THESE REALLY ARE THAT THESE ARE ACTS OF THE BAND AND BY ANY DEFINITION. AND OF COURSE NOTHING IN THE BILL. SAYS THAT THE UNION CANNOT TRY TO WIN BACK THOSE EMPLOYEES. IN ANOTHER ELECTION. WHAT THIS BILL DOES DO? ATTACK THOSE WORKERS WHOSE UNIONS HAVE ABANDONED THEM FOR THREE OR MORE YEARS HAS DEFINED. IN THE VERY LANGUAGE OF THE ALE I BE THAT I CITED AND THE. SPECIFIED FAILURES IN MANY CASES. OF UP OF SHOWING UP AND DOING THE RESPONSIBILITY. OF THAT THEY WERE ELECTED TO DO TWENTY ODD YEARS AGO SO AT SOME POINT THE REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. IN AN ABANDONED. IS LOST WHEN THE BARGAINING UNIT HAS CHOSEN NOT TO REPRESENT FOR WHATEVER REASON. SO IN THESE RARE CASES AND WE'RE ADMITTING THESE ARE RARE BUT THEY DO EXIST. THE LAW SHOULD ALLOW THE ELLERBEE TO DETERMINE THAT A BAND THAT HAS OCCURRED. AND DE CERTIFY THE BARGAINING UNIT BUT THAT I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MOTION IS DO PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS THURMAN NO THURMOND NO FLORA. FLORA AYE GONZALEZ FLETCHER GONZALEZ FLETCHER NO JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER NO KALRA. KALRA GNOME MCCARTY. MATHIS. MATHIS I. THAT BILL FILL SIR THANK YOU PICK YOU OUT NEXT TO A AB THREE ZERO NINE THREE. WITH A ARE SUGGESTING IT BUT THE TITLE HERE THE RIGHT TO AN EQUAL ENGAGEMENT. ARE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE OUR OWN REPRESENTATIVES. IS A BEDROCK PRINCIPLE OF OUR CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY. THAT PRINCIPLE APPLIES TO ALL CALIFORNIANS INCLUDING THOSE WHO WORK IN THE FIELDS. UNDER CURRENT LAW WHEN AN EMPLOYER AND A UNION FAIL TO REACH A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT. THE A A RP CAN CREATE AND ENFORCE A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT THROUGH THE PROCESS OF MANDATORY MEDIATION. MANDATORY MEDIATION IS DIFFERENT. THEN A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT. BECAUSE THERE IS NO MUTUAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES. AND IT DOES NOT ALLOW THE WORKERS THEMSELVES TO BE A PART. OF THE DISCUSSION. THIS BILL WILL GIVE FARMWORKERS THE LEGAL TOOLS THEY NEED. TO HAVE A SAY IN DETERMINING THE TERMS OF THE THEIR OWN CONTACT THE LABOR CONTRACT IF THOSE TERMS THEN THAT CONTRACT OUR PRODUCT OF THE MANDATORY. MEDIATION AND CONCILIATION ONCE THE LRP SETS FORTH THE TERMS UNDER MANDATORY MEDIATION THE TWO PARTIES MUST ABIDE BY THEM THE UNION. AND THE EMPLOYER. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE FARMWORKERS. THE PROCESS ALLOWS FOR AN UNELECTED BOARD. TO CREATE AN ENFORCED PROVISIONS OF A CONTRACT. IF FARMWORKERS HAD NO SAY IN CREATING. WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS CHANGE THIS AND GIVE FARMWORKERS THE RIGHT? TO VOTE ON A CONTRACT CREATED BY THE BOARD. BEFORE THE CONTRACT BECOMES BINDING. WITH NO LONGER FORCED ON FARMWORKERS WITHOUT THEM HAVING A CHANCE TO APPROVE THE AGREEMENT WITH THE MAJORITY VOTE. THE ABILITY TO RATIFY OR APPROVAL LABOR CONTRACT IS SHARED BY OVERWHELMING UNION WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA. YET IN THIS PARTICULAR PROCESS THEY ARE BEING DENIED TO FARMWORKERS AND AGAIN SILVIA LOPEZ AND JESSIE ROBOTS ARE HERE TO TESTIFY. THANK YOU WE WILL FIRST WITNESS. MY NAME IS SYLVIA LOPEZ I SUPPORT THIS AB THIRTY NINETY TERRY BECAUSE. I WAS LIVIN THIS AND. TWO THOUSAND TOFF. THEY'LL LEARN BE IN THE COMPANY THERE WERE. NEGOTIATED WITHOUT AS THE WORKER WITHOUT. ASKING US IF WE WANT IF WE WANT TO SEE THAT CONTRACT. JUST TO MAKE THIS VERY CLEAR I'M LEAD AGAINST THE UNION. AB BUT I JUST DIDN'T LIKE THE WAY THEY WERE DOING IT WE WENT TO MODESTO CALIFORNIA TO TRY TO GET IT IN AND THIS. NEGOTIATION AND WITHIN THE WITH THE LRP. AND. THEY DIDN'T LET US TO SEE WHAT WHAT IS THE CONTRACT. SO I THINK THAT'S SOMEBODY THAT. THAT IS NOT RIGHT. I'M. AT I THINK WE WE I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE THE SAME BRIGHT WE DON'T HAVE TO WEAR THAT I'VE READ TEE SHIRT. TO HAVE THAT RIGHT AND TO BE RESPECTED AND TO KNOW WHAT DATE WHAT IT WHAT WHAT IS INSIDE THE PACKAGE THAT WE GONNA BE BUYING. BECAUSE ACTUALLY WHERE. WE CAN PAY OUR FROM OUR CHECK EVERY WEEK TO. IBIDE SHOWING THAT BREATH TEACHER. AND SAYS WHERE OKAY IN THIS COMPANY WE DON'T NEED A RED TEE SHIRT AND WE DON'T NEED TO PAY OUR WORK GROUP PERCENT. AND WE THINK THAT WE DESERVE TO KNOW WHAT IS IN THE PACKAGE. ACUTE THAT'S WITNESS THANK YOU ADJUST YOUR HOUSE AGAIN WOULD PICK JUSTICE AB THIRTY NINETY THREE ENOUGH I SAID PREVIOUSLY THE CONTRACT THEY ARE BE WANTED A FORCE ON UPON THOUSANDS OF THE INDUSTRY'S HIGHEST PAID. EMPLOYEES AND WORKERS WHAT HAD ACTUALLY LOWER THEIR TAKE HOME PAY. BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT WOULD INCLUDE THREE PERCENT OTHER GOAT GROSS WAGES INCLUDING VACATION PAY. DOES NOT INCLUDE POTENTIAL FINES ASSESSMENTS WORK PERMITS INITIATION FEES ARE REINSTATEMENT FEES ETCETERA ETCETERA. NOT ONLY THAT BUT THE CONTRACT WOULD HAVE PROHIBITED THE WORKERS FROM A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT. WHICH IS TO PROTECT AND DEMONSTRATE. FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT IN THIS COUNTRY IT WILL ACTUALLY PROHIBIT THAT FROM DEMONSTRATING THIS ELLERBEE RAIN CONTRACT. ARM. NOW. IT'S WRONG TO FORCE A CONTRACT ON WORKERS WITHOUT LETTING THEM CHOOSE YOU NO WE HAVE A GENTLEMAN THAT MEANT UNITED AUTO WORKERS. WELL THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO SEE THE CONTRACT EVEN IF THE COMMITTEE. OF WORKERS THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO SEE AND VOTE ON IT. THEY WERE NOT ABANDON. SO LET'S NOT USE THAT SAMPLE THAT THE NOT A CAR REALLY TO THIS A PARTICULAR TEMPLE. YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND THE PREVIOUS BILL I ACTUALLY GET IT. BUT AB THIRTY NINETY THREE. ALL WOULD GIVES WORKERS THE SAME RIGHTS THAT IS EVERY OTHER CLASSIFICATION INDUSTRIAL WORKERS IN THE STATE AND THE COUNTRY HAVE. VOTE ON THE CONTRACT IF THEY LIKE IT OR NOT. WE SUPPORT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RIGHT. WHAT COLLECTED PARTY SHOULD BE TRANSPARENT? AND I'LL CLOSE WITH THIS I WOULD ASK MYSELF AND I WOULD THINK ABOUT THIS. IF THIS UNION AND LABOR ORGANIZATION THE NOT ABANDON THE EMPLOYEES FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS AND IN ANOTHER CASE FOR OVER FORTY YEARS. WHY HAS THERE BEEN A CONTRACT? WHY HAVEN'T THEY COLLECTED THREE PERCENT WAGES FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS? THANK YOU AND I URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU AND I'M CERTAIN THAT THOSE WHO ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL WHEN THEY HAVE DROPPED TO HE WILL ADDRESS SOME OF THE QUESTIONS FRANCE. OTHERS WISHING TO ADD ON IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. I WOULD WISH AN ADD ON AND SUPPORT PLEASE COME FORWARD. MY NAME'S DEROGATORY AND AS A FORMER FARM WORKER I SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. MY NAME IS LOSE HAD A LOPEZ AND I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS. THIS BILL THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS LINDA WRINKLE. I SUPPORTER VOTED NINETY THREE. BRAZIL THE SLOW I'M LOPEZ. AND I SUPPORT A. B. THIRTEEN ANYTHING THANK YOU THANK YOU.

ONE LAST THOUGHT OF THIS ME NOBODY'S MONEY THAT HE THOUGHT I MEAN THIS. THE APPLE YOU WASTED THE. PRESSURES. YOU MEAN NUMBER S. GLOW THE ABOUT IT EARLIER PUT YOU A STEP. BLESS HIS. ME NO MEDICINES THE LIMITING INTEREST YES YES. WE KNOW THAT A LOT ON HIP WITH THE LATE. REST. MY NUMBER ADDRESS LIKE CASF BOIL UP FOR YOUR A. B.. USES. ANYONE ELSE WISHING THAT ON IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. PLEASE COME FORWARD. PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN MARIO MARTINEZ ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED FARM WORKERS IN OPPOSITION TO A. B. THIRTY NINETY THREE. I DID WANT TO ONCE AGAIN CORRECT A FEW. MISSTATEMENTS. FARMWORKERS DO HAVE A SAY IN WHAT IS NEGOTIATED AND THAT'S THROUGH A DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED NEGOTIATING COMMITTEE THAT. AT LEAST THE UNITED FARM WORKERS AND I KNOW OTHER UNIONS USE. IT'S A COMMITTEE COMPOSED OF WORKERS WHO INFORMED THEIR REPRESENTATIVE WHAT KIND OF ISSUES THEY WANT ADDRESS THAT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. I THOUGHT SO THE IDEA THAT FARM WORKERS HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS BEING NEGOTIATED SIMPLY FALSE. THE IDEA THAT FARMWORKERS AT THIS PARTICULAR COMPANY CORRALLING FARMS DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS KNOWS NEGOTIATED IT IS ALSO FALSE THE FARM WORKERS KNOW VERY WELL. COPIES OF THE. OPPOSED MEDIATED AGREEMENT HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED TO THE WORKERS SO THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S IN THE CONTRACT WAS NEGOTIATED. THE IDEA THAT THIS OP MEDIATED AGREEMENT LOWERED PAY. SIMPLY FALSE THE MEDIATED AGREEMENT CALLED FOR WAGE INCREASES ABOVE AND BEYOND ANY THREE PERCENT. ONE OF AROUND FARMS COMPLAINTS IS THAT IT WAS BEING ASKED TO PAY TOO MUCH. OVER AND ABOVE BEYOND THREE PERCENT. IN ORDER TO GIVE WORKERS INCREASED WAGES. AGAIN THOSE THINGS ARE ALSO FALLS. THERE IS NO. LEGAL. RIGHT TO RATIFY A CONTRACT THAT'S A THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S. DISCUSSED AMONG THE UNIONS IT'S AN INTERNAL PROCEDURE THAT'S SOMETIMES AFFORDED TO MEMBERS SOMETIMES A SUPPORTED TO COMMITTEES WHAT THE LAW SAYS. IF THAT THE UNIONS HAVE A RIGHT TO DETERMINE HOW TO DO THAT WITHIN THEIR OWN CONSTITUTION. AGAIN WITH RESPECT TO THIS SPECIFIC EMPLOYER. THE IDEA THAT IT. IT WAS PAYING THE HIGHEST WAGES IN THE INDUSTRY IS LAUGHABLE BECAUSE IT IS BEING SUED FOR MINIMUM WAGE VIOLATIONS. AND HAS NOT PAID THE HIGHEST WAGES IN THE INDUSTRY BECAUSE OF THESE MINIMUM WAGE VIOLATIONS. SO ONCE AGAIN THERE IS NO NEED. THERE'S NO RIGHT LEGAL RIGHT FOR WHAT IS BEING ASKED FOR HERE. IT'S ANOTHER WAY FOR THE EMPLOYER TO INTERFERE WITH THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS THIS EMPLOYER WAS ALREADY FOUND TO HAVE INTERFERED WITH THE RIGHT OF THESE EMPLOYEES. SELECT OR NOT SELECT THE UNION A SECOND VOTE WOULD ADD AN ADDED HURDLE AT GETTING A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT THAT THE MIGHT OF BINDING MEDIATION LA WAS DESIGNED. TO PROTECT SO FOR THOSE EASONS THE UNION. IS IN OPPOSITION OF AB THIRTY NINETY THREE THANK. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MIGHT BE A WITH CALIFORNIA LIBERATION OUT ALSO ADD THAT THE HILLARY WOULD ONLY THINK THIS ACTION WITH THE EMPLOYERS ENGAGED IN. UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE AT THE WORK SITE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE AIRLINE BICU DOES WIN THE. WHEN THE EMPLOYERS BILL'S BARGAIN IN GOOD FAITH WHEN THEY SON WHEN THEY'VE DONE. SAYS BAD DAMAGE DURING NEGOTIATING PROCESS THE SIXTEEN YEAR OVER YEAR THAT IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR THOSE WORKERS TO GET A FAIR CLICK THE BARGAINING AGREEMENT SO. WITH THAT WE'RE POST. THANK YOU. JESSICA CENTER EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES WERE OPPOSED THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MAP BROUGHT ON BEHALF THE TEAMSTERS IN OPPOSITION MAKE YOU THINK YOU. MARK SCHACHT ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE ALSO ONE OF MY AYE IN OPPOSITION. Q.. TO THE LEVEL OF THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SO REMEMBER MATHIS AYE I'M ACTUALLY A QUESTIONS FOR THE THE UFW GUY. THE FEET COME BACK NOW. ATTORNEY. CLAUDIA MARTINEZ FOR YOUR MONEY NEVER GO MARIO MARTINEZ. MISTER MARK USING IN YOUR COLUMN INTO YOU STATED THAT YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE YOU DOING THESE THINGS ARTI MEAN. AND IN GRANTED I'M I'M SUBBING TODAY ON LABOUR'S IS MY FIRST TIME HERE SO FORGIVE ME. AMONG ME I'M USUALLY ON OTHER COMMITTEES. BUT. THE IN I'VE READ SEVERAL ORGANIZATIONS IN MY LIFE AND AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE HOW. HOW OFTEN? DO THE THESE GROUPS. TO IT WHAT WALK ME THROUGH ESOS THEY COME THROUGH THEY CONTRACT THEY TAKE A VOTE. NOW YOUR UNIONS IN CHARGE OF THE EMPLOYEES CORRECT. THE THE UNION ACTS AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE UNION ACT PURPOSES OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING OKAY SO HOW OFTEN DO THEY ME IS A MONTHLY THING IS THAT OUR QUARTERLY IS IT. BY ANNUALLY. IT DEPENDS ON WHETHER THERE'S AN EXISTING CONTRACT OR WHETHER THEY'RE TRYING TO NEGOTIATE A NEW CONTRACT IF THERE'S A CONTRACT IN PLACE THAT AND THERE'S LESS NEED FOR MEANS IF THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE. IN THIS CASE OF THE CASE OF OF CORRALLING FARMS I BELIEVE THE UNION. FROM THE BEGINNING OF TWENTY THIRTEEN AND TO TELL THAT'S THE AREA THERE'S NOT SO THERE IS A ENTERED CONTRACT WHEN YOU GUYS USE HER I'M TRYING TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. MATH. BOOK MAD ABOUT ELEVEN TIMES AND THEN THEY HAD ANOTHER FIVE OR SO MEETINGS WITH THE MEDIATOR TO TRY TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT I'M I'M NOT I'M NOT ASK ABOUT THE GROOM LIKE IT'S AYE ASKING I MEAN. YEAH YOU EARN ATTORNEY FOR THE UNION AND WHAT'S THE STANDARD THAT YOU GUYS PUT TOGETHER I MEAN I I WHAT I'M I'M TRYING TO PICTURE THIS IN MY HEAD SO I CAN EXPLAIN THIS. THE FOLKS BACK HOME BECAUSE. WE MUST ORGANIZATIONS EITHER ME. MONTHLY OR QUARTERLY AND THEN YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU DISSEMINATE THE INFORMATION BACK DOWN TO THE THE PEOPLE THAT IT'S REPRESENTING. ENOUGH SAID ON NATIONAL BOARDS ARE SET ON STATE BOARDS. YOU KNOW HOW HOW DO YOU. HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN THIS INFORMATION BACK DOWN TO THE UNION MEETS AS MANY TIMES AS NECESSARY MEANWHILE MEETS WITH HER. WITH THE EMPLOYER THEY WILL HAVE A WORKER NEGOTIATING COMMITTEE. THAT IS COMPOSED OF DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED WORKER LEADERS. AND THEN BASED ON THE MEETINGS THEY HAVE WITH THE EMPLOYER THEY WILL THEN HAVE MEETINGS WITH THE REST OF THE WORK FORCE TO ADVISE THEM HOW NEGOTIATIONS ARE GOING AND IS THEIR STANDARD ON HOW OFTEN THOSE MEETINGS ARE TO OCCUR. IT DEPENDS ON. HOW NEGOTIATIONS ARE GOING WITH THE EMPLOYER IF AN EMPLOYER TELLS THE UNION WE'RE NEVER GOING TO SIGN A CONTRACT WITH YOU? DON'T BOTHER MEETING WITH US THAT MAY HAVE AND THAT'S NOT WHAT I AND THAT MANY OF AYE AYE FAMILY OUT THERE THERE WAS A MACHINE MATHIS IF WE WILL ANSWER YOUR RIGHT THAT THE WITNESS FINISH ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION. THAT MAY AFFECT HOW MANY TIMES THE UNION MEETS WITH THE EMPLOYER. IF THE EMPLOYER REFUSES TO ME THAT WILL AFFECT HOW MANY TIMES THE UNION MEETS WITH THE IMPORTANT ON SO IT DEPENDS ON I'M I'M NOT CONCERNED WITH HOW OFTEN THE UNION MEETS WITH. PEOPLE THAT REPRESENTS ON THE GROUND. DURING ACTIVE NEGOTIATE THEIR IT'S STANDARD WITHIN YOUR UNION ON THAT. DURING ACTIVE NEGOTIATIONS VERY FREQUENTLY. IT WILL BE. ON A WEEKLY OR BI WEEKLY BASIS THERE'S NOTHING WRITTEN IN IN THE CAR THE UNION'S CONSTITUTION BUT WHEN THERE ARE ACTIVE NEGOTIATIONS. AND THERE'S A RESPONSIVE IMPORTER IT WILL BE VERY FREQUENT SO SO THE UFW YOU ALL. DOESN'T HAVE WITHIN ITS CONSTITUTION. AN ANNUAL MEDIAN TIME FOR TALKING TO MEMBERS OF THE UNION. NO AND I DON'T KNOW THAT ANY UNION HAS THAT IN ITS CONSTITUTE. OKAY I'D I JUST I'VE EVER AGAIN I'VE WORKED WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS IT ACROSS THE U. S. AND THEY ALL HAVE. MEDIAN REQUIREMENTS AND WHEN THEY MEET HOW THEY MEET AND AND ALL THOSE THINGS RAN OUT OF THE CONSTITUTION SO. I'M I'M JUST THE GET I'M CURIOUS ON HOW THIS WORKS. SO. NOT THAT THAT'S IT THANK YOU THANK YOU. I THINK THAT THE WITNESS ESTABLISHED A FEW TIMES THAT THERE ARE. THE FREQUENCY OF MEETINGS INCREASES WHEN THERE IS NEGOTIATING GOING ON YEAH AGAIN I MISS HIM AND I'M I'M NEW TO THIS AND I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THIS WORKS TO THIS AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ON THE STAND UNDER SCARES THE CONSTITUTIONS AND BYLAWS USUALLY HAVE. STANDARD MEETING TIMES WHAT IT OR NOT SHE UNUSUAL AND WE WANT YOU TO COME BACK AND HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING ABOUT HOW ORGANIZATIONS TYPICALLY WORK. IT LABOR ORGANIZATIONS HAVE AT THEIR HEART TO REPRESENT. THOSE THAT THEY REPRESENT IN CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS AND ADVOCATE FOR THEM IT WOULD NOT BE UNUSUAL FOR THEM TO NOT HAVE SOME. CURRENTLY ARTICULATED SCHEDULE FOR WHEN THEY MEET BECAUSE THEIR MEETINGS ARE OFTEN DICTATED BY. ANY MATTERS THAT THEY MIGHT BE DEALING WITH AT THE TIME AS A WAY OUR I ABSOLUTELY AM I JUST FIND IT SURPRISING THAT THERE'S NOT A STANDARD MEDIAN TIME RAN INTO THEIR. BY LAWS OF THE CONSTITUTION DEEP IT'S NOTED THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. BILL HAS A MOTION. AND THE SECOND. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SEEN NONE SO PATTERSON MAKE LIKE TO CLOSE. OB I THOUGHT I THINK WE STRAYED JUST A LITTLE BIT FROM THE FOCUS AND I WANT TO BRING US BACK TO MANDATORY. MEDIATION AND CONCILIATION. IT IS IN THAT CONTEXT THAT THIS BILL. TEMPS. TO BE ABLE TO PUT THE FARMWORKERS. IN THE ROOM. I WENT THROUGH ALL OF THIS. WITH THESE FARMWORKERS BACK IN THE TIMES WHEN WE WERE GOING THROUGH. THE MANDATORY MEDIATION. AND I WAS SURPRISED THAT THEY WERE NOT ALLOWED IN THE ROOM. THAT THEY COULD NOT HAVE REPRESENTATIVES IN THE ROOM THIS WAS. SOMETHING THAT THE LRB BOARD DID. THAT JUST AMONGST THEMSELVES. AND THESE ARE THE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE THE THE THIRD LARGEST STEAK. IN THE DECISIONS THAT WERE BEING MADE INSIDE THAT ROOM. AND STEM THEM I ALSO WAS A BIT BIG SURPRISE TO ME THAT THAT. WHEN THE HELL ARE BE DETERMINE WHAT. THEY WERE GOING TO REQUIRE IN THE CONTRACT AND. AND MANDATORILY. PRESENTED TO THE UP. TO THE FARMWORKERS THE VERY PEOPLE THAT. THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE TO LIVE WITH THOSE DETAILS. NOW THEY DON'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT IT STUDY IT. AND THEN THEY DON'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE ON IT. THAT SEEMS TO ME TO BE A A A REAL A DEPARTURE FROM I THINK GENERAL. UP PRACTICE AND CERTAINLY I THINK IT DOES CALL INTO. SOME QUESTION. AT BUT WHETHER OR NOT THESE THESE FARMWORKERS REALLY ARE ENGAGED AND AND IT IT AND HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO SIT LISTEN HERE AND VOTE. ON WHAT'S GOING TO A AFFECT THEIR LIVES. I MEAN IF AND FUND A FATHER UP. UNIONS AND UNION MEMBERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO SEE THE CONTRACT. BUT I DON'T THERE WOULD EVEN ALLOWED THE COMMITTEE. IN THE ROOM. SO THERE THERE IT WAS A. THE FACT THOUGH MANDATORY. WITHOUT. SEEING IT UNDERSTANDING IT OR EVEN HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY. TO VOTE ON IT. WE REALLY I REALLY THINK THE CONTRACTS. SHOULD NEVER BE FORCED ON WORKERS. A CONTRACT REALLY IS IN THE WORKERS BEST INTEREST. LET THEM VOTE ON. LET THEM SEE IT LET THEM BE IN THE ROOM. LET THEM HAPPY AT LEAST A COMMITTEE IN THE MANDATORY ME. IT'S NORMAL FOR CONTRACTS TO BE RATIFIED BY A VOTE. ESPECIALLY SINCE IT'S THE WORKERS WHO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LIVE WITH IT. AND I I JUST THINK THAT IF IF THIS IS AG. AND IMPORTANT RIDER PRIVILEGE THAT. MOST UNION MEMBERS HAPPEN STATE CALIFORNIA THESE FARMWORKERS SHOULD HAVE THAT. RIGHT AND PRIVILEGE AND AGAIN THIS IS WITH RESPECT. TO ONLY THAT AREA OF THE MANDATORY. ABOUT. CONTRACT THAT IS THAT THAT THEY ARE FORCED TO ACCEPT WHETHER THEY LIKE IT OR NOT OR WHETHER THEY CAN. VOTE ON IT. YES OR NO FOR THOSE REASONS I THINK THIS BILL. NARROWLY A SCOPES THIS PARTICULAR I THINK BLEMISH IN THE. DUE PROCESS AND THE OPERATIONAL PRACTICES AVAIL ARE BE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ATTEMPTING TO FIX HERE AND WITH THAT I I REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. FAMOUS BETTER SOON WE KNOW THE COMMENTS THAT YOU'VE MADE ABOUT FORCED DECISIONS AND THINGS OF THE LIKE WE ALSO NOTE THAT WE HEARD FROM REPRESENTATIVES TODAY WHO HAVE SAID THAT THERE ARE REPRESENTATIVE GROUPS. THAT WORK ON BEHALF OF THE WORKERS IN AND THAT IS THE WAY IN WHICH INFORMATION ABOUT THE CONTRACTS ARE COMMUNICATED BUT THANK YOU. FOR YOUR CLOSE UP PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS THURMAN NO THURMAN NO FLORA. FLORA AYE INSULTS FLETCHER. CONSULT WHICH ARE KNOWN JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER NO KALRA. KALRA GNOME MCCARTY. MATHIS BY MATHIS AYE. OF THE BILL FAILS. UP MOVING ON TO A. B. THIRTY NINETY FOUR. AND. I AYE IN PRESENTING THE FINAL BILL I DO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE. COURTESY IN THE OPPORTUNITY OF PRESENTING AND FOR. LISTENING HEARING. THESE FARMWORKERS WITH THEIR WITH THEIR POINT OF VIEW ON SOMETHING THAT OBVIOUSLY IS SORT OF OUT OF THE. MAINSTREAM OF OF OF ACCEPTED UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING IN THE FIELD BUT THESE ARE REAL PEOPLE LIVING THROUGH THESE. SIGNIFICANT CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEY HAVE ASKED. FOR ME TO PRESENT THESE ON THEIR BEHALF BECAUSE THEY HAVE THEY HAVE GONE THROUGH THESE THINGS AND AND ASK REALLY CREATED SOME SOME REAL HEARTACHE. THIS FINAL BILL NOW IS REALLY A DUE PROCESS. BELT. SEEKS TO PROTECT. BUT RIGHT TO FARMWORKERS THE LRP IS CURRENTLY AUTHORIZED. TO THROW OUT THE RESULTS OF AN ELECTION. AND CERTIFY A LABOR ORGANIZATION AS THE EXCLUSIVE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNIT. IF EMPLOYER MISCONDUCT IS FOUND THAT MAY HAVE INTERFERED WITH THE VOTE. HOWEVER THERE IS NO RECOURSE IF MISCONDUCT BY AN ENTITY. OTHER THAN AN EMPLOYER. IS SIX BUT IS SUSPECTED NOR. IS IT AN OPTION TO HAVE A NEW ELECTION IF THIS WERE TO OCCUR SO IN FACT THERE IS NOT. EVEN A JUDICIAL REVIEW AVAILABLE WITHIN THE APPELLATE COURT SYSTEM. WHEN THE NLRB DECIDES TO VOID THE RESULTS AN ELECTION. AND I. WE NEED TO REMIND. THIS COMMITTEE THAT THAT THAT. THOUSANDS OF THESE FARMWORKERS HAVE ALREADY VOTED AND THOSE BOATS ARE SEQUESTERED THEY'RE IN A BOX SOMEPLACE IN THE THAT THERE THAT JUSTICE DISAPPEAR IN THE NOT. THEY'RE NOT BEING COUNTED. SO THAT RIGHT TO CHOOSE EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATION IS REALLY CREPT UP THE CRITICAL TO FARMWORKERS AS IT IS TO ALL WORKERS BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT ON WAGES AND WORKING CONDITIONS AND BENEFITS OF THIS BILL. PROVIDES PROTECTION TO ENSURE THAT THE VOICES OF THESE WORKERS ARE IN FACT HEARD. AND AGAIN THIS IS WITH SPECIFIC REFERENCE TO THE MANDATORY NATURE OF THE A A RP ACTIVITY SO UNDER THE BILL THE ELLERBEE MUST ORDER. A NEW ELECTION TO BE HELD IN THE CASE OF MISCONDUCT BY AN EMPLOYER. BOARD PERSONNEL OR LABOR ORGANIZATION THIS GIVES THE POWER TO DECIDE BACK TO THE EMPLOYEES THIS BILL WOULD ALSO. SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY AN APPELLATE COURT A BOARD ACTION THAT CERTIFIES THE RESULT IN THE ELECTION WITHOUT COUNTING THE BALLOTS OF WORKERS AND THAT IS THE PRECISE SITUATION WE SEE. IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA HERE AGAIN TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SILVIA LOPEZ AND JESSIE ROW HOUSE. HI MY NAME IS HAVE A LOPEZ AND I SUPPORT THIS. BILL A. B. THIRTY EIGHT NINETY FOUR. BECAUSE. HONESTLY I REPEAT THIS AGAIN ONCE MORE TIME. MORRELL NINETY PERCENT OF FARM WORKERS AND FRESNO COUNTY REPORTED IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE.

BUT I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO INVITE YOU GUYS. TO GO AND TALK TO THIS. MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND FARMWORKERS SO YOU GUYS CAN SEE. WHAT IS THE REAL THING WHAT'S GOIN NON REALLY OVER THERE BECAUSE?

THANK YOU JUST ACROSS WOULD PICK JUSTICE SO FINALLY AB THIRTY NINETY FOUR. I YOU KNOW I THINK THIS WAS MOST IMPORTANT FOR FARMWORKERS SPECIALLY THEY NEED TO BE ALLOWED TO CHOOSE THE REPRESENTATION OBVIOUSLY. BUT THOUSANDS OF WORKERS ACHIEVE THE BORDER AS WE MENTION WE KEEP GOING AFTER THIS SITE SAMPLE IN FRESNO AREA. ARE THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM TWICE A COMPLETE OF PETITIONS OR SIGNATURES FOR THAT A VOTE. THEY ALERT BE ADMINISTERED THE ELECTION THEY'LL ARE BE ALLOW THE ELECTION BOB ANOTHER ONE OF THE THREE THE WORKERS BALLOTS I MEAN YOU HAD STILL GET TOWARDS BEGIN THE PHONE FORMER GENERAL COUNSEL OF THE OTHER BE. LITERALLY SEEN COURT. ABOUT SUPPORTING OR ARE SUGGESTING TO THE COURT THE DESTRUCTION OF THE BALLOT TO ME THIS IS AMERICA. WHO WANTS TO DESTROY VOTES THAT IS COMPLETELY WRONG? YOU KNOW IS A BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST FARMWORKERS. NO. JUST IMMIGRANTS JUST LATINO IMMIGRANTS I SHOULDN'T BE THAT EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE IN THE RIGHT TO SEE THE RESULTS OF THE VOTE. HE LIKE ANY GENERAL ELECTION YOU KNOW IF THEY THEY'LL ARE BE HAVE A PROM WITH AN ELECTION THEY RAN AND THEY ADMINISTER AND THEY PUT THE RULES TO. THEN DON'T PUNISH THE WORKERS JUST TO ANOTHER ELECTION. IF SOMETHING SO GOOD A BELIEVER IN THE STATION AS SUCH SO CALLED CONTRACT SO GOOD WHAT IS THERE TO FEAR.

THEY'RE NOT PAID TO COME HERE THEY LEAVE THE KIDS BEHIND THIS OTHER PERSON TO DONE THIS DOZENS OF TIMES YOU GUYS KNOW THAT. AND TO SAY THAT IT'S JUST DRIVEN BY A PARTICULAR THOUSANDS OF WORK AT THAT PARTICULAR. LOCATION IT'S ABSOLUTELY FALSE. ARM WE DON'T HAVE TIME HERE TO GET IN A DEBATE AND I WANNA BE RESPECTFUL OF EVERYONE'S TIME. BUT I WOULD ENCOURAGE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO ACTUALLY VISIT AT A PARK OR WHEREVER YOU WANT. WORKERS FROM AROUND THE STATE SALINAS MONTEREY SANTA MARIA EL CENTRO BAKERSFIELD DELANO. FRESNO I MEAN YOU NAME THE PLACE YET YOU WANT TALK THEM DIRECTLY IN ASKING QUESTIONS DIRECTLY AND HAVE THEM SHOW YOU THEIR PAYSTUB TO YOU SEE THE REAL WORKER.

PRO EMPLOYEE PRO LATINO PRO IMMIGRANT POOR PEARL WORKFORCE THERE THE ONE SCRAMBLING AROUND TO COME UP WITH GAS MONEY. THE ONES LOSING THOUSANDS OF JOBS. NOT THE GROWERS A BROADER SET FOR LIFE. THEY HAVE OTHER INTERESTS THIS IS PRO EMPLOYEE PERIOD. SO I URGE YOU TO LEAD A REAL COURT FEEL THIS ISSUES. AND I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE WITH THIS BEFORE THE. GENTLEMAN FROM BAKER FOR THE ATTORNEY COMES UP TO SPEAK AND AND DISTORT THE FACTS ARMED. WHICH I DON'T FIND CREDIBLE IN ATTORNEY THAT ALLOWED HIS OWN CLIENT TO BE SUED IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT FROM WITH TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR BREAKING LABOR LAW. BUT WITH THAT BEING SAID. I ENCOURAGE ALL OF YOU TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE FACTS HE FAILED TO MENTION THAT THE ABANDONMENT OR I'M SORRY THE MC PROCESS. WAS ACTUALLY BEING LEAGUE LITIGATED IN THE FIFTIES RECORD OF APPEAL BECAUSE AN EMPLOYEE. WHO SHOWED UP TO MODESTO WAS NOT ALLOWED TO GO IN AND SEE THAT THE CONTRACT? SO THANK YOU AND I URGE YOU TO VOTE YES. OTHERS WISHING TO ADD ON SUPPORT TO THIS BILL. MOVED BILL. BILLS MOTION A SECOND OTHERS WISH AN ADD ON IN SUPPORT. MY NAME'S DEROGATORY AND I SUPPORT DISPEL.

THIRTY NINETY FOR THE LANGUAGE OF THE PROPOSED BILL TALKS ABOUT THE REMEDIES THAT COULD BE ORDERED IN CASES WHERE. I AM PLAYER INTERFERES WITH AN ELECTION PROCESS OR A UNION INTERFERES WITH THE ELECTION PROCESS. THE BILL ISN'T NECESSARY BECAUSE THOSE STANDARDS ARE WELL LAID OUT. UNDER CURRENT LAW CASE LAW IF THE COMMITTEE IS INTERESTED IN DETAIL OF HOW THIS WORKS THE LABOR BOARD'S RECENT DECISION AND FORTY TWO A OR B. NUMBER ONE. DETAILS THE EXTENSIVE ILLEGAL ACTIONS OF ROWAN FAR MEAN. HOW THEY IMPROPERLY INTERFERED WITH THE ELECTION? IN HOW THEY AND VALIDATED THE ELECTION. THAT PARTICULAR DECISION AS ACTUALLY BEING REVIEWED BY A COURT OF APPEALS AS IS PROPER SO THE IDEA THAT THERE'S NO REVIEW OF THE BOARD'S DECISION IS IS INCORRECT. THERE ARE PROCEDURES FOR WHEN EMPLOYERS INTERFERE WITH ELECTIONS THERE ARE REMEDIES FOR THAT UNDER WELL ESTABLISHED LABOR LAW. THERE REALLY IS NO NEED FOR THE BELL IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER BUT UFW OPPOSES AB THIRTY NINETY FOUR THANK YOU. OTHER. OTHERS WISHING TO ADD ON IN OPPOSITION. MICHAEL YOUNG WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION RUSSELL POST. THANK YOU. JESSICA CENTER IN GRADES ADVOCATES VERY MUCH SUPPORT THE RIGHTS OF FARMWORKERS BUT DON'T BELIEVE THIS BILL ACCOMPLISHES THAT APPOINTMENTS WHICH WAS IS THAT I JUST GOTTA HOLIDAYS BUT OPENS ON WHEELS CASE TO BREAK THE DAILY ACCO BLESSED. US MORE IN OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. MARK SHUT CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION IN OPPOSITION MAKE YOU. SHANE GUSMAN ON BEHALF OF THE TEAMSTERS OPPOSED. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE WISHING AT ON IN OPPOSITION CA NINE OUTSIDE TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SIMILAR GONZALEZ FLETCHER THIS IS BEEN HEARTBREAKING TO SET THROUGH THIS BECAUSE. I THINK THOSE OF US WHO HAVE LOOKED AT THE ENTIRE PROCESS OF WORKER IRWIN HAS DONE. THEY LITERALLY FIRED WORKERS IN ORDER TO AVOID OR TRY TO AVOID A UNION ELECTION IN NOW THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN. YOU KNOW A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO. THE FACT IS IF WE DON'T ACCOUNT FOR THAT IF WE DON'T ALLOW OUR BOARD TO ACCOUNT FOR. THE IN EVERY BAD ACT. THAT THE EMPLOYER HAS DONE. IN EVERY INSISTENCE THAT THEY REFUSED TO ALLOW A UNION THEY THEY WERE. POOR ACTORS AND IN THE PROCESS PEOPLE LOST THEIR JOBS. THEY'RE POOR ACTORS IN EVER WANTED TO NEGOTIATE A CONTRACT THEY CREATED ALL THE SITUATIONS. THAT WERE NOW HERE TALKING ABOUT. AND THAT'S HEARTBREAKING BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND SELF DETERMINATION OF WORKERS IN WANTING NOT. IN WORKERS DESERVE THAT. BUT WE CANNOT ALSO IT AND AND ONE DAY HOPEFULLY THIS WILL BE RESOLVED. BUT WE CAN'T ALLOW BAD ACTORS IT IS ABOUT THE GROWERS WE CAN'T ALLOW BAD ACTORS. TO VIOLATE THE LAW OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. KEEP WORKERS. FROM BEING ABLE TO HAVE THEIR RIGHTS AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED HERE. CLEARLY WHAT HAPPENED. AND I IT'S IT'S HARD BECAUSE OF COURSE YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO SEE IT HERE IN AND LISTEN TO AN AUTHOR PROMOTE FARMWORKERS WHEN. THAT AUTHORS NEVER VOTED FOR ANYTHING THAT WOULD EXTEND THE BENEFITS AND WAGES A FARMWORKERS. THIS IS THIS IS A PROXY FIGHT IN ONE THE DOESN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE IN IT IT HURTS ME BECAUSE I WANT TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO HELP ALL OF THESE WORKERS. EVEN MY TO IN ITS GREAT WE CAN SAY THIS IS WORKER DRIVEN IN SURE BUT THE ADS THAT ARE COMING UP ON MY FACEBOOK. ARE ARE ARE NOT BEING PAID FOR BY WORKERS THE SHIRT YOU'RE WEARING IT THAT'S NOT BEING PAID FOR BY WORKERS THIS ENTIRE GROUP ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS ENTIRE GROUP. AND THE LAWSUITS AND EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN PLAYED IS BY THE WORKERS NOW IT'S PLAY THE EMPLOYER. IN OUR LABOR LAWS ARE FULLY OUT OF BALANCE INNATE ALWAYS ALWAYS IN EVERY INSTANCE. BENEFIT THE EMPLOYER OVER THE EMPLOYEE. AND RIGHT TO UNIONIZE. SO I UNDERSTAND I MEAN. I UNDERSTAND THE FRUSTRATION. AN END AS SOMEBODY WHO HAS DEDICATED MY LIFE TO REPRESENTING WORKERS AYE AYE AND. EMPATHIZE THE FRUSTRATION BUT THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE EVERY SITUATION WHERE IN NOW WAS CAUSED BY THE EMPLOYER IN THE ONLY WAY WE HAVE RULES THAT WILL EVER BENEFIT WORKERS IS WITH WE HOLD THOSE EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTABLE. FOR THEIR BAD ACTS SO I'M SORRY I CAN'T SUPPORT IT I'D MEET WITH THE WORKERS ANYTIME YOU ASK I WILL COME DOWN AND TALK TO THE WORKERS AB AS I'VE CONTINUED TILL. I'M THROUGHOUT ANY PROCESS ANYTIME A WORKER HAS ASKED ME TO TO MEET WITH THEM I COME SEE THEM. BUT BUT I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND I UNDERSTAND I'M GONNA BE WAITING FOR YOU YES BUT I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND KNOW YOUR EMPLOYER. CAUSED THIS WHICH WHICH AND PEOPLE LOST THEIR JOBS BECAUSE THEY SUPPORTED THE UNION I'M NOT SORRY THIS ALL STARTED IN THAT HAS BEEN OUR LATEST A MOMENT PLEASE POST THEM ON THE PLEASE PLEASE ALLOW THE MEMBER TO FINISH. SO I JUST I JUST WANT TO STATE THAT BECAUSE IT IS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR SOMEBODY WHO ADVOCATES ON BEHALF OF FARM WORKERS IN AND HAS A CLEAR RECORD OF THAT NOT JUST COMING FORWARD WHEN IT AT EMPLOYER. OR GROW WHERE SUPPORTS A BILL. IT'S IT'S HEARTBREAKING BECAUSE I THINK UNFORTUNATELY THAT YOU HAVE BEEN LET DOWN ON. IF WE ARE GOING TO MAINTAIN DECORUM AND NOT HAVE A DEBATE HERE. IF ANY MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE WISHES THE ASKS A QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR OR TO WITNESS NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO. I'LL GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO HAVE YOUR LAST WORDS. BUT LETS OUT WE DO HAVE A LONG NIGHT I DON'T KNOW I DON'T I DON'T SPEND ENOUGH I CAN MAKE A QUESTION. JUST BIGGEST CAN I MAKE A QUICK AT SO THAT MEANS THAT WE COULD NOT BE FORCED. TO BE IN A CONTRACT WITH THE UNION. IF IT YOU SAY THAT IS THE EMPLOYER FAULT. IF THE THAT'S GONNA. KEEP BOTH TO CHOI OR OF TO MAKE A CONTRACT. WITH THE UNION YET I DON'T KNOW WHY I DON'T. THAT ME ASK YOU THIS QUESTION EARLIER TODAY THE ATTORNEY FOR THE UFW SAID. THAT IF THE MEMBERS DON'T WANT TO BE REPRESENTED BY THE UNION THAT THERE ARE STEPS THEY CAN TAKE TO HAVE THAT CHANGED. HAVE YOU ARE TAKING ANY OF THOSE STEPS. YES PLEASE ELABORATE WAS THAT'S WHAT STEPS HAVE YOU ALL TAKEN. IF WE DON'T WANT TO JOIN THE UNION. THAT'S WHY I WENT TO THE NLRB TO ASK FOR ANOTHER ACTION. BUT IF THE. IF YOU'VE GOT IT'S NOT THAT YOU DON'T WANNA JOIN UNION IF YOU DON'T WANNA HAVE A UNION THAT THEY'RE CERTAIN. I DON'T NEED IT UNION UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN PROCESS SEES THAT HAVE TO BE FOLLOWED. IF THE UNION EXIST. THERE ARE MANY CASES WHERE THEY MIGHT BE INDIVIDUALS WHO JUST SAY THAT'S NOT FOR ME AND THEY DON'T WANT TO. BUT IN ORDER FOR THE UNION TO NO LONGER EXIST THERE ARE STEPS THAT HAVE TO BE PROCESS HAVE TO BE FOLLOWED. TO REMOVE THE UNION FROM REPRESENTING THE WORKERS AND I'M ASKING IF YOU OUGHT TAKEN THOSE STEPS. TO REMOVE THE UNION FROM THE US HAITIAN NOT JUST GOING TO THE A A RP TO SAY YOU DON'T WANT BUT WHAT STEPS HAVE YOU TAKEN ANOTHER ACTION WE HADN'T ELECTION TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN. TO DECERTIFY THAT UNIT THAT WE NEVER ASKED FOR. THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW THE. IN A WAY I THINK THAT THE COMPANY HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO NOTIFY US TO THAT THERE WAS A UNION THAT WAS CERTIFIED IN NINETEEN NINETY. MOST LRB RULE AGAINST YOU IN THAT MATTER. YEAH THE SAID THAT I WOULD COLLECT THE SIGNATURES. THEY SAID THAT THAT SIGNATURE WHAT'S OF FRAUD THAT WE MAKE UP THAT SIGNATURES AND THAT MAKES OF PHIL'S SOLO SO BACK UNDERSTOOD. YEAH SO YOU HAD TO VOTE AND THEY THEY A ARE BE RULED AGAINST YOU IN THAT MATTER WAS ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU WANTED TO ACT. OUGHT NOT JUST IN THIS AND I WANT TO CLARIFY THE PROCESS SO THEY COLLECTED SIGNATURES TWICE. AND AND ELECTION ACTUALLY WAS APPROVED BY THE ELLERBEE AND RAN BY THE OTHER BEGIN ADMINISTERED BY THE LRV WOULD KNOW ISSUES THEY JUST LOCKED UP THOSE BALLOTS AFTER THAT THE OF THE ELECTION. I HAVE NOT COUNTED THIS IS THAT. BUT THE WHOLE PROCESS WAS FOLLOWED BY HER IN A REST OF OUR EMPLOYEES THE THE PGA PREPARE PROCESS. NOT ONE THING I JUST IF I CATCH THE QUICK POINT EARLIER MISTER MARTINEZ MENTIONED THE A A RP BOARD. ARE THE LRB BORE WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE. QUALIFY BOARD IS SUPPOSED TO BE A KNOWLEDGEABLE BOARD. WELL LET'S LOOK AT ONE OF THE CURRENT AYLER BEFORE MEMBERS OF THE HALL I'M GONNA STOP YOU RIGHT THERE I'M TO STOP YOU RIGHT THERE A PROBLEM THINK I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO NOT IMPUGN THE MEMBERS OF A BOARD. THEIR QUALIFICATIONS ARE NOT AT QUESTION HERE IN FOR THIS MATTER THERE'S A SPECIFIC BILL IF YOU WISH TO MAKE ANOTHER POINT YET IN ADVOCACY FOR THIS BILL. I WILL ALLOW THAT SIR MID MAY I. MISTER CHAIRMAN I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO IMPUGN THE PROP ONE IF PRESS ROOM OR OUTSIDE HIS RETIREMENT NO PRO MAY MAKE YOUR POINTS. ACROSS ABOUT THE BILL YES SIR THANK CHAIRMAN YASSER. THIS COMMITTEE HAS FORCED THESE MEMBERS TO SIT THROUGH. AN EMPLOYMENT OF THEMSELVES OVER THIS BILL. THERE HAS BEEN ISSUES RAISED ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. SADNESS OVER THE FACT THAT THEY'RE BEING FOOLED. I AND YOUR OUTRAGED BY THIS AND YOU'RE NOT OUTRAGED BY US BEING LECTURED. IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BILL. SIR I JUST ASK BIRTH A STIFF FAIRLY ADJUDICATE WHAT'S HAPPENING AND I WILL HELP. WITH OUR WITNESSES TO DO THAT. I APPRECIATE WITNESSES WHO'VE BEEN HERE TODAY. WE HAVE LISTENED TO EVERYTHING THAT EVERY WITNESS HAS HAD TO OFFER. THERE HAS NOT BEEN AGREEMENT ON MANY ISSUES INCLUDING ISSUES AROUND THE BAND ADMIT. IN ISSUES AROUND AND ARE BE. I DO NOT THINK IT IS ACCURATE. FOR YOU TO SAY. THAT ANY MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE HAS IMPUGN ANY MEMBER WHO'S COME HERE TO TESTIFY. EVERYONE WHO'S ASKED FOR IT HAS BEEN GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THEIR VOICE HEARD. UP I THINK I MAY NOT HAVE AGREEMENT I APPRECIATE THAT LIMIT AND I AM NOT CLOSE IT IF I MAY FINISH. AND AT TIMES THERE MAY HAVE BEEN. EMOTIONAL. AND SPIRITED COMMENTS RACE. BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE IT'S ACCURATE TO SAY THAT ANYONE IN THIS CHAMBER HAS IMPUGNED ANYONE WHO'S ASKED FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD. THEY WENT THROUGH THE NEFELUS AGREE I UNDERSTAND WELCOME YOUR CLOTHES I UNDERSTAND THAT THANK YOU UP. THIS HEARING. IS A MATTER OF PUBLIC RECORD. AND THE COMMENTS OF MEMBERS WHO HAVE. IMPUGNED ARE A MATTER OF THAT RECORD AND. IT'S THEIR. I'M GONNA CLOSE WITH THIS. THE OPPOSITION. IT'S SAD THAT THIS IS UNNECESSARY. BECAUSE THERE'S. LAW THERE'S PENALTIES FOR MISCONDUCT BY ALL PARTIES. THAT IS NOT TRUE. SECTION ELEVEN FIFTY SIX POINT THREE HALF OF THE LABOR CODE IDENTIFIES ONLY. EMPLOYER MISCONDUCT AS A CAUSE FOR IGNORING THE VOTE OF THE WORKERS. CERTIFYING THE LABOR ORGANIZATION THERE IS NO. OTHER COUNTERPARTS IN BATON LAW. OTHER THAN THE EMPLOYER. IT SEEMS TO ME INTHIS COUNTRY IN THE STATE THAT WE UNDERSTAND SOME VERY FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES. OUT OF OF RIGHTS THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE WITH THAT WE CHERISH THE CONCEPT OF LEGITIMATE REAL REPRESENTATION. THAT PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED FREELY AND OPENLY TO CHOOSE. AND THAT WE ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO SEEK REDRESS THROUGH A JUDICIAL SYSTEM. WHEN WE HAVE BEEN WRONG. WE WILL WE HONESTLY REFUSED TO EXTEND THOSE RIGHTS TO FARMWORKERS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S AT STAKE HERE. AND THAT IS WHY THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE ASKED FOR THIS KIND. OF SOLUTION BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN THE ONES THAT HAVE BEEN HARMED AND THE DOOR HAS BEEN CLOSED. TO THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO. REDRESSING A GRIEVANCE AND TO HAVE. LEGITIMATE REPRESENTATION OF THEIR OWN CHOICE WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CLOSER PLEASE CALL THE ROLL THERE'S A MOTION AND A SECOND. MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THURMAN NO THURMAN NOW FLORA. FLORA AYE GONZALEZ FLETCHER GONZALEZ FLETCHER NO JONES SAWYER JONES SAWYER NO KALRA. KALRA NO MCCARTY MATHIS.

NEXT UP WE'LL BE HEARING FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER AGUILAR CURRY WHO'S PRESENTING AB TWENTY SIX TEN. WELCOME ASSEMBLYMEMBER AGUIAR CURRY. CLEAR THE AIR. GOOD AFTERNOON THIS AFTERNOON AIR MEMBERS. AB TWENTY SIX TEN WILL GIVE TRUCK DRIVERS WHO TRANSPORT LIVESTOCK NUTRIENTS AND BUY PRODUCTS TO RURAL AND REMOTE AREAS THE OPTION TO START THEIR MEAL AND REST PERIOD. ON THEIR SIX HOUR OF WORK. CURRENTLY DRIVERS ARE REQUIRED TO STOP FOR A MEAL AFTER FIVE HOURS. SOMETIMES TRAVELING ON SMALL ROADS THROUGH RURAL COMMUNITIES CREATES A DIFFICULT SITUATION FOR DRIVERS LOOKING FOR A SAFE PLACE TO PULL OVER ONCE THEY HAVE HIT THE FIFTH HOUR. EVEN IF THE DRIVER CAN PULL OVER HERE SHE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SAFELY LEAVE THE TRUCK UNATTENDED TO TAKE A REST. BY GRANTING THIS NARROW ONE OUR FLEXIBILITY AB TWENTY SIX TEN WILL ALLOW DRIVERS IN RURAL COMMUNITIES. TO COMPLETE THE ROUTE AND THEN ENJOY THEIR WELL DESERVED BREAK IN A SAFE AND SECURE LOCATION. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS GREG GARLAND FOR THE CALIFORNIA GRAIN AND FEED ASSOCIATION AND ANOTHER EHRENREICH BURGLAR CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES. THANK YOU PROVIDE SPEAK. LIKE THAT JUST. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME BEFORE YOU ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY SIX TEN THAT'S BEEN INTRODUCED BY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND YOUR CURRY. MY NAME IS GRANT GARLAND I AM THE VICE PRESIDENT OF BOREAL INCORPORATED AND A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA GRAIN AND FEED ASSOCIATION'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS. MORRELL IS A FAMILY OWNED BUSINESS LOCATED IN WILLIAMS CALIFORNIA. THE COMPANY'S FOCUS TO PROVIDE VALUE ADDED FEED PRODUCTS TO COMMERCIAL LIVESTOCK INDUSTRY INCLUDING DAIRY BEEF HORSE SHEEP GOATS POULTRY SWINE. AS WELL AS MANY OTHER SPECIES. IN ADDITION TO PRODUCING AND DISTRIBUTING BALL COMMERCIAL LIVESTOCK FEEDS BARI ALSO MANUFACTURES A FULL LINE OF SAC PRODUCTS. THEY'RE FOR SALE THROUGH RETAIL FOOD STORES. THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS TO THESE RETAIL FOOD STORES AND COMMERCIAL LIVESTOCK OPERATIONS AND FIVE OF THE WESTERN UNITED STATES. IT OWNS AND OPERATES A FLEET OF CLASS EIGHT TRUCK TRACTOR'S PULLING FLATBED TRAILERS BULK STRINGER TRAILERS AND HOPPER TRADERS. ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY SIX TEN ADDRESSES A SPECIFIC ISSUE THAT IS RELEVANT TO BAR ALE AND THE FEED INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA. THIS AMENDMENT TO THE LABOR CODE IS NEEDED BECAUSE THE CURRENT LANGUAGE IS VERY RESTRICTIVE AND PROBLEMATIC TO BOTH THE EMPLOYEE EMPLOYEES AND THE EMPLOYER AS WELL. SOMETIMES OUR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT DEVELOPED IN THE PROCESS OF DELIVERING THE FEED TO OUR CUSTOMERS IN RURAL AREAS. THAT THEY AFFECT THE TIMING OF THE MEAL PERIODS. THE GEOGRAPHIC THAT AREA THAT WE CAN EFFECTIVELY ACCOMMODATE WITH OUR OWN FLEET OF TRUCKS. IS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SOUTHERN OREGON IN NORTHWESTERN NEVADA. IN THIS REGION WE OFTEN FIND OURSELVES USING REMOTE RURAL ROADS TO REACH OUR CUSTOMERS THERE OFTEN NARROW TWO LANE ROADS TO TWIST ON WINE THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS. AND THROUGH RURAL AREAS THERE'S OFTEN NO SAFE PLACE FOR THE DRIVER TO PULL OVER. AND ENJOY A DUTY FREE MEAL PERIOD. OFFICIAL REST AREAS ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN AS ARE THE SMALL COMMUNITIES APPLY ALONG THE WAY. THE REST AREAS A DO EXIST ARE NOT SUITABLE ON BAD WEATHER. FOR A MEAL PERIOD IS THERE ARE NO INDOOR FACILITIES THERE. AND YOU SEE A LOT OF TIMES AT ARREST OR YOU'LL SEE TRUCKS THEIR AND AND I'M SURE THEY'RE THEY'RE TAKING THEIR MEAL PERIODS AND BREAKS AND SO FORTH BUT THOSE ARE. TYPICALLY GONNA BE INTERSTATE TRUCKERS AND HAVE SLIPPERS ON THEIR. TRUCKS WHICH IT'S LEGAL FOR THEM TO TAKE THEIR MEAL PERIOD IN THERE. AND THERE A SLEEPER. MOST OF OUR TRUCKS CHECKED ALL OF OUR TRUCKS ARE ALL DAY CABS THEY DO NOT HAVE SLEEPER SO IT'S NOT. ACCORDING TO THE RULES WE CANNOT TAKE THE MEAL PERIOD INSIDE THAT TRUCK IF WE COULD ASK YOU JUST GRAB YOUR THOUGHTS PLEASE. I'M SORRY IF WE COULD ASK YOU TO WRAP UP YOUR THOUGHTS PLEASE WE APPRECIATE IT. OKAY. THE WELL OF THE THE. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO FOR US TO BE ABLE TO TAKE A BREAK AND PRACTICAL MATTER WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE FOOD. MODERNIZATION ACT WHICH MEANS WE CAN'T LEAVE THESE TRUCKS ON ATTENDED WHERE WHERE THEY CAN BE SUBJECT TO REST FOR ADULTERATION OR ANY OTHER KIND OF CONTAMINATION SO. FROM A PRACTICAL PERSPECTIVE THE WAY THE RULES WRITTEN RIGHT NOW IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO COMPLY WITH ITS OUR DESIRE. IS TO GET THE EXTRA. OUR OF FLEXIBILITY THAT THIS BILL. AFFORDS US THAT'S WHAT WERE WHAT WERE LOOKING FOR NEXT. SO WITH THAT I WOULD APPRECIATE. YOUR CONSIDERATION OF AND THANK YOU FOR HEARING ME AND I APOLOGIZE FOR CUTTING OUT WE JUST HAVE A TWO MINUTES PER WITH THE SIZE COMMITTEE SO THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS.

AS I TRAVEL THROUGHOUT THE STATE I HEAR STORY AFTER STORY BUT HOW SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN HIT BY BICU SUE AND FRIVOLOUS PAGA LAWSUITS. THAT ARE INTENDED TO EXTORT MONEY FROM THEM AND THREATENING THEIR ABILITY TO STAY IN BUSINESS. SOME TRIAL ATTORNEYS ARE GOING ACROSS THE STATE WITH TEMPLATE THREAT LETTERS DEMANDING MONEY TO MAKE A LIVING TO MAKE IT THE LITIGATION GO WAY. THESE TEMPLATE LETTERS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY DESCRIPTION OF THE ALLEGED VIOLATION OR HOW MANY EMPLOYEES ARE BEING IMPACTED. ACCORDING TO THE NONPARTISAN LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE OVER SIX THOUSAND PROGNOSIS ARE FILED EVERY YEAR. EVEN MORE EGREGIOUS THEIR CENTRAL ATTORNEYS THAT HAVE TARGETED IMMIGRANT OWNED BUSINESSES BECAUSE THEY ARE LEAST ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THESE ABUSIVE LAWSUIT THREATS HAD THEREFORE MORE LIKELY TO PAY THE DEMAND IN ORDER TO BE LEFT ALONE. A PROVIDE EXAMPLE TO SHOW WHAT THESE ABUSIVE POPULAR LAWSUITS LOOK LIKE. A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER IN MY DISTRICT WAS HIT WITH A FOURTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR LAWSUIT SIMPLY FOR PROVIDING HIS EMPLOYEES WITH THE BONUS FOR WORKING SAFELY. THE OWNERS OFFENSE WAS NOT INCLUDING THE HOURLY BONUS IN THE REGULAR PAY RATE FOR CALCULATING EMPLOYEES OVERTIME RATE. A MINOR LABOR CLIP CODE REQUIREMENT THAT COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN FIXED WITHOUT A MULTI MILLION DOLLAR LAWSUIT. THE OUTCOME OF THESE* LAWSUITS TOO OFTEN BY THE ATTORNEYS POCKETING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BY THE ALLEGE AGGRIEVED EMPLOYEES RECEIVED PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR. OUR BUNGALOW WASINTENDED TO PROVIDE PROTECTION FOR EMPLOYEES NOT TO BE USED AS A LEGAL WEAPON BY TRIAL ATTORNEYS TO EXTORT A QUICK BUCK. I THE STATUS QUO ARE PAGA LAWS HURT BOTH EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES BECAUSE OF THE ABUSIVE WAY OUR LAWS ARE BEING USE. EVEN NON PROFITS THAT SERVE THE NEEDS OF LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES HOMECARE PROVIDERS AND THOSE BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT HAVE BEEN HIT. BUT PAGA LAWSUITS THAT ARE THREATENING THEIR ABILITY TO HELP PEOPLE AND OUR VERY OWN COMMUNITIES. NOW IS THE TIME TO MAKE SOME COMMON SENSE REFORMS THE PAGA. IS RESPONSIBILITY OF THIS INSTITUTIONAL BODY TO ENSURE THAT OUR LAWS ARE NOT ABUSED ENGINE SURE THERE IS JUSTICE AND FAIRNESS. FOR THOSE WERE VICTIMIZED THIS BILL WILL REMOVE THE CLOUD OF COSTLY LITIGATION HANGING OVER THE HEADS OF SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND EMPLOYEES. NOW WITH ME DID TODAY TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT IS KEN BARNES OF CITIZENS AGAINST LAWSUIT ABUSE. INVINCIBLE. BUT SONNY SEE OWNER OF SANTA FE IMPORTERS WHO WAS HIT WITH A POPULOUS IS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. MY NAME IS VINCENT PASSING YOU SEE. ON THE PRESIDENT SANTA FE IMPORTERS WE OPERATE SEVERAL TELLING DEL HE'S THE FIRST MY GRANDFATHER STARTING LONG BEACH IN NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN. WE ARE SEVEN MANUFACTURING PLANT REMAKE FOOD PRODUCTS FOR COMPANIES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. INCLUDING A BRAND CALLED EXCELLENTLY TAMALES WHICH WAS STARTED IN CALIFORNIA IN EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR. WE'VE FOR NEARLY SEVENTY PEOPLE MANY OF WHOM ARE LIKE FAMILY TO PASS. THREE YEARS AGO WE WERE SUED UNDER THE PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACT FOR WAGING OUR VIOLATIONS. AT FIRST I THOUGHT LITTLE OF THE LAWSUIT BECAUSE WE ENCOURAGE OUR EMPLOYEES TO TAKE ALL THE REST PERIODS AND GIVE THEM A WIDE LATITUDE. REGARDING HOW AND WHEN TO TAKE THEIR BREAKS. IN ADDITION TO THEIR REQUIRED BREAKS OUR TEAM MEMBERS WILL OFTEN STEP AWAY TO USE THE RESTROOM GRAB A CUP OF COFFEE TAKE PERSONAL PHONE CALL. NO PROBLEM. BUT THE WAY JUDD THE WAGE ORDERS ARE VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT HOW EMPLOYEES MUST TAKE THEIR BREAKS. BASICALLY THEY HAVE TO WORK TWO HOURS TAKE A TEN MINUTE BREAK WORK TWO HOURS TAKE A LUNCH WORK TO HOURS TAKE A BREAK. FOR TWO HOURS FINISH THE DAY. I COMPLETELY AGREE BREAKS ARE NECESSARY BENEFICIAL AND DESIRABLE. BUT WHO WORKS LIKE THAT. WE HAVE TEAM MEMBERS THAT WANT TO TAKE A SHORT LUNCH OR SKIP LUNCH BECAUSE THEY WANT TO LEAVE EARLY TO SEE THEIR KIDS SOCCER GAME. BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO LOSE A HALF HOUR OF PAID TIME. WE HAVE TEAM MEMBERS THAT START AT FIVE THIRTY IN THE MORNING AND THEY DON'T WANT TO TAKE THEIR LUNCH AT TEN THIRTY THE ONE TAKE AT LUNCH TIME WITH THEIR. WITH THEIR TEAM MEMBERS. SOME PEOPLE HAVE ASKED COULD THEY TAKE A SINGLE TO A TWENTY MINUTE BREAK EARLIER IN THE DAY AND THEN A HALF AN HOUR LUNCH LATER SO THEY GET TO LONGER BREAKS. PRIOR TO THE POD LEGISLATION. EMPLOYEES CAN MANAGE THE BRIEF THE THEIR BREAKS MEAL PERIODS THE WAY THEY WANTED TO. BUT WITH THE INFORMATION WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PARGA EMPLOYERS AND THEIR EMPLOYEES ARE HELD TO THE LETTER THE WAGE ORDER. EVEN WHEN IT IS CONTRARY TO BOTH COMMONSENSE AND HUMAN NATURE. AND NOW ATTORNEYS HAVE A TOOL TO LEGALLY EXTRACT LARGE SUMS OF MONEY FROM PEOPLE WHO ALLOW THEIR EMPLOYEES FREEDOM TO WORK THE WAY THEY WANT. PART OF FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EMPLOYERS TO ALLOW EMPLOYEES A FLEXIBLE SCHEDULE AND THOSE WHO DENY EMPLOYEES LEGITIMATE BEST TIME. IN OUR CASE WE. ENDED UP HAVING TO SETTLE FOR THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WE ARE PUT INTO A POSITION OF EITHER HAVING TO SETTLE. OR GO TO COURT AND RISK LOSING OUR BUSINESS. THE UP PLAINTIFF IN OUR CASE CLAIM. PENALTIES OF OVER TWO MILLION DOLLARS WHICH WOULD FORCE US INTO BANKRUPTCY. IN ADDITION WE HAVE TO PAY A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN IN LEGAL EXPENSES. AND THE PLAINTIFF ATTORNEYS IN OUR CASE RECEIVED A FULL THIRD OF THE SETTLEMENT. THE SAME BUSINESS WHERE TO CUT STAFF BY TEN PERCENT REDUCE BENEFITS SUCH AS PAID VACATION HOME PROFIT SHARING. WE HAD TO DENY WHERE THE EMPLOYEES BONUSES AND RAISES. FOREGO REPLACING AGING EQUIPMENT. AND AND HAD TO BORROW MONEY TO STAND BUSINESS THERE WEEKS THIS PAST YEAR WHEN I FEARED I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE OUR PAYROLL. I ASK HOW IS IT JUST THAT LEGISLATION CAN ALLOW GROUP OF PROFESSIONALS TO COERCE MONEY FROM ANOTHER GROUP IN SUCH A WAY. WITHOUT DUE PROCESS WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE TRUE NATURE OF THE SITUATION WITHOUT OPPORTUNITY TO CORRECT ERRORS AND OMISSIONS. GIVEN ONLY THE CHOICE TO PAYER LOSE ONE'S BUSINESS. PARK IS A BLUNT INSTRUMENT THAT FAILS TO SEPARATE GOOD EMPLOYERS FROM BATON ALLOWS ATTORNEYS TO EXPLOIT THE LEGAL SYSTEM TO THEIR OWN BENEFIT. SOMETHING WAS CHANGE. SMART WELL CONSIDERED LEGISLATION WILL PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF BOTH WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS WE'LL JUST WE COMPENSATE THOSE WHOSE RIGHTS HAVE BEEN VIOLATED YET. USE GOOD JUDGMENT AND COMMON SENSE WHEN DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN THOSE WHO WOULD DENY THEIR WORKERS THEIR RIGHTS AND THOSE WOULD GIVE THEIR EMPLOYEES FREEDOM TO LIVE AND WORK IS A SEE FIT. YOU VERY MUCH. A CUTE WITNESS. UP THINKING MISTER CHAIRMAN MY NAME IS KEN BARNES MYSTICISM AND BARS AND JUST CHECK IN WITH YOUR AUTHOR WE TYPICALLY ONLY GO ABOUT FOUR MINUTES AND WE WENT ABOUT THAT BUT WE WILL MAKE WIN ANOTHER TWO MINUTES WE WITNESS WE WOULD JUST HAVE TO EXTEND THE SAME THING TO. THE OPPOSITION SHOULD THE OPPOSITE THAT THAT ON PUBLIC. A SHORT MISTER CHAIRMAN. UP CLAIMANTS CAN BARNES WITH CITIZENS AGAINST LAWSUIT ABUSE AND. APOLOGIES FOR ANY NERVOUSNESS OF MY SHOWS THE SECOND TIME I'VE EVER SAT HERE IDEA. THAT I THINK PART OF THE WELL INTENDED MEASURE IT'S JUST BEING USED IN A WAY TO MANIPULATE TELL EMPLOYERS PARTICULARLY THOSE WITHOUT THE RESOURCES. NECESSARY TO FIGHT BACK. PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO ARE SHOWING FLEXIBILITY I THINK. WE WANT TO REWARD EMPLOYERS WHO ARE GIVING WORKERS FLEXIBILITY I THINK ALL OF US AT SOME POINT OUR LIFE HAVE BEEN HOURLY EMPLOYEES AND YOU. YOU WANT TO LEAVE TEN MINUTES EARLY AND MOVE YOUR BREAK BECAUSE YOU'RE THERE SOMETHING YOU WANT TO GO TO. SOME THE FREER FAMILY AND WE HAVE PART IS BECOME A A COUPLE BLUNT INSTRUMENT THAT PENALIZES THOSE EMPLOYERS ARE NOT. TREATING WAIT STAFF THEY'RE NOT STEALING FROM THEIR EMPLOYEES JUST WHAT HAPPENS THE THE WAY THAT IT'S WRITTEN IT COMES OUT AS ALL MY GOSH YOU DIDN'T DO EXPIRE Z. THERE FOR YOU. IT INSTANTLY FOR YOUR EMPLOYEES THERE'S ONE EXAMPLE THAT I WANTED TO GIVE THAT WAS JUST RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO. ARE ADVANCE CALL CENTER TECHNOLOGIES OPEN IN TWENTY TWELVE OF THE CALL CENTER LOOKING TO HAVE TWO THOUSAND JOBS THEY WERE SUED UNDER PARDON TWENTY FIFTEEN. ITSELF FOR TWO POINT FOUR FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THEIR SUIT AGAIN BY PAGA. STUDENT TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN A LAID OFF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE EMPLOYEES. I'D HAD IT YOU TO EVEN BE WORN ACT AND THAT LAST MONTH THEY ANNOUNCED THEIR CLOSURE. THERE ARE TWO OTHER VIOLATIONS WAS THAT THERE ADDRESS SAID WEST SPACE LAKE INSTEAD OF WHAT LIKE ONE WORD. AND THE OTHER VIOLATIONS WAS ADVANCED CALL CENTER TECH INSTEAD OF TECHNOLOGIES AND THOSE WERE THINGS WORD THAT'S NOT WHAT THE LAW WAS INTENDED TO DO. AND SO WE ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER. SPELL THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU OTHERS WISHING TO ADD ON IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. JOHN NERGIE JOHN DIRTY WITH THE. CIVIL JUSTICE STATION JUST WANT TO SAY THAT IT'S A GOOD EXAMPLE OF. OF WHERE THINGS ARE BEING ABUSED IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE SOLUTION WE'D LIKE TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WILL. PROVIDE RELIEF FOR BUSINESSES SO. PLEASE. RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE MAKE YOU.

BRIAN LITTLE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION SUPPORT. THANK YOU. AND GROWTH CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE WISHING AT ON IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE OPPOSITION. PLEASE PROCEED. EXCUSE ME MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MARK CHAKRA CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION HERE IN OPPOSITION. TO AB TWENTY SIXTEEN BECAUSE IT FUNDAMENTALLY UNDERMINES THE CENTRAL PURPOSE OF THE PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S ACT. BY ALLOWING EVEN SERIOUS LABOR LAW VIOLATIONS LIKE WAGE THAT HAVE. TO BE CURED RATHER THAT PROSECUTED BY AND GRIEVED WORKERS STANDING IN THE SHOES OF THE LABOR COMMISSIONER. AS THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS PRIVATE ENFORCEMENT UNDER PAGO ONLY% OCCURS AFTER A PLAINTIFF IS EXHAUSTED HER ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES AND GIVEN THE STATE OF FIRST CRACK AT PURSUING. THE VIOLATION ITSELF WHEN THE STATE CHOOSES NOT TO CITE AN AGGRIEVED WORKER CAN FILE A SUIT TO PURSUE ALL. REMEDIES FOR ANY VIOLATIONS THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO THE LABOR COMMISSIONER UNDER THE LABOR CODE. FROM RECENT CONVERSATIONS WITH. OTHER RURAL LEGAL SERVICES PROGRAMS IN TWENTY COUNTIES WE ESTIMATE THAT WE FILED MORE THAN A HUNDRED PAGA LAWSUITS ON BEHALF OF FARMWORKERS AND LOW WAGE WORKERS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR. ALMOST ALL OF OUR PAGO LAWSUITS INVOLVE WAGE THEFT AND MANY OF THEM ALSO INVOLVE OTHER SERIOUS LABOR LAW VIOLATIONS LIKE DENIAL OF. MEAL AND REST PERIODS AND PROVIDING WORKERS WITH FRAUDULENT WAGE STATEMENTS MEANT TO DISGUISE WAGE THEFT. SINCE TARGET WAS ENACTED WE'VE RECOVERED AND DISTRIBUTED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN WAGES AND PENALTIES TO FARMWORKERS AND OTHER LOW WAGE WORKERS. AND PROVIDED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO THE STATE LABOR AGENCY. BY ALLOWING EMPLOYERS TO CURE SUCH SERIOUS VIOLATIONS. AB TWENTY SIXTEEN UNDERCUTS THE MAIN PURPOSES OF PACA ONE IS TO MAKE WORKERS HOLE FOR ALL OF THE WAGES. AND PENALTIES THAT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER COULD RECOVER SHE BROUGHT THE CASE. AND SECOND TO DETER FUTURE MISCONDUCT. BY UNSCRUPULOUS EMPLOYERS BY PENALIZING THEM FOR ALL LABOR LAW VIOLATIONS THAT. HAVE OCCURRED I JUST WANT TO DISPUTE THE OFFICE CONVENTION THAT THE BILL MAINTAINS THE EXISTING PAGA PROTECTIONS FOR EMPLOYEES. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT ALLOWS. ALTHOUGH ALMOST SERIOUS VIOLATIONS TO BE CURED. THAT DOESN'T PENALIZE EMPLOYERS. AND IT DOESN'T PROTECT WORKERS THE WAY PAPA WAS INTENDED. I JUST OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MICHAEL YOUNG UP HALF THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WERE ALSO POST THIS BILL. THIS BILL WOULD. DELAYED JUSTICE FOR WORKERS WHO ARE SEEKING REMEDIES FOR A THE FOR LABOR. VIOLATIONS AT THE WORK SITE. OH SORRY. YET WILL THIS BILL ESSENTIALLY MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT WORKERS TO BRING CLAIMS IN A POCKET AT. SOME REQUIREMENTS ON WORKERS TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO BRING COLLECTIVE ACTION AND A MOST DANGEROUSLY IT EXTENDS WHEN ALMOST DOUBLES THE RIGHT TEACHER PERIOD FOR A EMPLOYERS WERE FOUND TO VIOLATE THE LAW. OF THE DOUBLING THE RIGHT SECURE PERIOD ESSENTIALLY A DISINCENTIVE I'D SIMPLE ERRORS FROM FOLLOWING THE LAW IF YOU CAN BREAK THE LAW IF YOU DON'T THE BIBLE LABOR CODE AND THEN YOU CAN JUST SIMPLY SAY ONCE YOUR CALL. YOU HAVE A CHANCE THE CORRECTED THERE'S REALLY NO INCENTIVE TO FOLLOW THE LAW IN THE FIRST PLACE A WE FEEL IT IS A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT AGAIN WITH THE. PROLIFERATION OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS IN THE PRIVATE WORKPLACE. POCKETS BECOME ONE OF THE ONLY PLACES WHERE AGAIN WORKER CAN BRING CLAIMS COLLECTIVELY AND THEY CAN SEEK VIOLATION BECAUSE IT JUST IS AGAINST THE EMPLOYER FOR LABOR VIOLATIONS AT THE WORK SITE WITHOUT HAVING TO GO TO THROUGH THE. EMPLOYERS PRIVATE ARBITRATION PROCESS BUT THROUGH PIE THAT THESE WORKERS ARE ALLOWED TO HAVE THEIR CASES HEARD IN A COURTHOUSE WITH THE JURY AND THEY GIVE IT CAN BRING THESE CUT BEAT THE COMPLAINT BRING THESE CLAIMS. ENCONTRE COLLECTIVELY TOGETHER UP FOR THOSE REASONS WERE OPPOSED. THIS WILL OPPOSITION. VERY GOOD AS YOU ARE WITH THE CALIFORNIA PLANET LAWYERS ASSOCIATION ALSO IN OPPOSITION I WOULD JUST. AND THAT. I THINK IT'S EASY TO PICK SOME OF THE RELATIVELY MINOR VIOLATIONS THAT ARE GOING ON IN THE LAWSUIT BUT. THESE WORKERS REALLY AREN'T COMING TO ATTORNEYS BECAUSE THE SPACE IS WRONG IN THE NAME THERE'S OFTEN. A LOT OF OTHER VERY SERIOUS VIOLATIONS THAT ARE HAPPENING WE'VE HEARD OF THIS EXAMPLE ABOUT THE SAFETY THE THE. CHRISTMAS BONUS BUT WE ACTUALLY LOOKED INTO THAT CASE AND IT WAS A SAFETY BONUS IN THERE WAS. OVERTIME IN WHICH THAT VIOLATIONS ALSO VERY SERIOUS VIOLATIONS GOING ON. SO JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THERE'S ALSO WORKERS SITES AS SOME OF THE STORIES AS WELL THAT NEED TO BE HEARD. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SHANE GUSMAN ON BEHALF OF THE TEAMSTERS AMALGAMATED TRANSIT UNION THE MACHINISTS UNITE HERE THE OUT W. AND OTHERS ALL OPPOSE THIS BILL. WHICH MAKE ONE QUICK POINT THAT THIS UP MANY OF THE PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL REJECTED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WHEN THEY. MADE A BUDGET DEAL TO REFORM PAGA I THINK SOME OF THE. ABUSES ARE ALLEGED ABUSES THAT WERE. SPOKEN ABOUT ARE ARE CURED BY THAT. BUDGET DEAL. THANK YOU. JACKIE STERN ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA ALSO IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. NICHOLAS CHAO'S ON BEHALF UNITED FARM WORKERS IN OPPOSITION MAKE YOU. EVAN AND I HAD MY THE AMOUNT FROM THE THE REST OPPORTUNITY CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA AND IF I MAY JUST MAKE ONE POINT.

LOCAL MARKETS SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY WITH WORK SAFE AND ALSO JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT FEDERAL OSHA HAS HOW STATED IN ITS ONE OF ITS FX MEMOS THAT THESE TYPES OF SAFETY DISINCENTIVE.

SEEING NONE TRYING TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SEEING NONE. IS THERE A MOTION. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. NO QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OR WOULD LIKE CLOSE I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY I I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE ROBUST DEBATE AND IN THE FORCE OVER THE FOLKS THAT WERE INVOLVED IN DISCUSSION. UMNO WE ARE LOOKING TO. REFORM PARGANA WAY THAT PRESERVES THE RIGHTS OF THE EMPLOYEES BUT ALSO. ALLOW SMALL BUSINESSES TO EXPAND TO GROW AND NOT TO BE A HIT WITH FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS THAT WILL FORCE THEM TO MAKE THE DECISION OF WHETHER TO CLOSE OR GO OUT OF BUSINESS. THAT'S REALLY GOOD RESULTING IN THEIR EMPLOYEES BEING HURT WITH LOSS OF WHAT WAGES A LOSS AND HEALTHCARE BENEFITS AND AS YOU CAN TELL FROM THAT THE LARGE COALITION. OF OVER EIGHTY ORGANIZATIONS. THAT OUR SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IS THAT THERE IS SOMETHING THAT IS A MESS HERE THAT THIS LAW IS BEING ABUSED AND WE WE NEED TO FIND A SOLUTION I WOULD HOPE THAT WOULD WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE. IN SOME WAY OF FINDING THAT SOLUTION THANKS VERY MUCH I REQUEST I'VE. THANK YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. QUESTION IS DO PASSED TO JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THURMOND NOW THURMAN NO FLORA.

THIS SHOULD BE AN EASY ONE FOR YOU. THIS SHOULD BE A PIECE OF CAKE. I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY FOUR EIGHTY FOUR WHICH PROVIDES FLEXIBILITY FOR EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES. TO NEGOTIATE COMPENSATION FOR TIME WORKED IN EXCESS OF THEIR EIGHT HOUR WORK DAY OR FORTY HOUR WORK WEEK. EXISTING LAW AUTHORIZES AN EMPLOYEE AND THESE ARE MAINLY AGRICULTURAL WORKERS. TO ACCUMULATE UP TO TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY HOURS OF PAID TIME OFF IN LIEU OF OVERTIME PAY. PROVIDED THE EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE AGREED TO THIS AGREEMENT. SOLITARY. HOWEVER EMPLOYEES WHO ARE SUBJECT TO INDUSTRIAL WELFARE COMMISSION WAGE ORDERS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS VALUABLE OPTION AND THAT'S. ALMOST EVERYONE ELSE. AB TWENTY FOUR EIGHTY FOUR EXPANDS THE PROFESSIONS AND INDUSTRIES THAT CAN AVAIL THEMSELVES TO THIS VOLUNTARY ARRANGEMENT BY REMOVING THE CURRENT EXCLUSION OF HARD WORKING INDIVIDUALS ALLOWING THEM TO RECEIVE COMPENSATING TIME OFF. IN PLACE OF OVERTIME WAGES. FOR MANY INDIVIDUALS THE VALUE OF PAID TIME OFF MAYBE DIRETOR THAT OVERTIME PAY. EMPLOYEES NEED THE OPTION TO SUBSTITUTE PAID TIME OFF AS COMPENSATION FOR THEIR OVERTIME SO THEY CAN HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO ATTEND A HEALTH CARE NEEDS CHILD SCHOOL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER IMPORTANT ERRANDS. LITTLE LEAGUE GAMES TO. AB TWENTY FOUR EIGHTY FOUR ALLOWS EMPLOYERS TO BE MORE COMPETITIVE BY OFFERING THIS CHOICE IN FURTHER ASSIST THE NEEDS OF THOSE WHO SEEK MORE FLEXIBLE WORK ARRANGEMENTS.

WERE NOT THE BENEFICIARIES OF THIS KIND OF A PROVISION. AND THE ENTIRE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY. UP I PUT BENEFICIARIES AND QUOTE I BELIEVE I BELIEVE THE REASON THEY WERE EXCEPT IT WAS TO PROTECT THEM FROM THE. IT OF THE WELL KNOWN WIDESPREAD. FRAUDULENT. ITEMIZE WAGE STATEMENTS. PRACTICES IN THE INDUSTRY OF THERE'S JUST A A SERIOUS CONCERN THAT THAT FOLKS WILL BE LEVERAGED INTO TRADING THEIR OVERTIME FOR THE PROMISE OF. OFF COMPENSATION OFF TIME. IT WILL NEVER AND FACT MATERIALIZE. AL DON'T BE LEVERAGED OR COOL WORST INTO THAT AND THAT WAS THE REASON FOR OUR CONCERN. AND JAM. I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. BUT IT WAS LIMITED TO HAPPEN DIGITAL OPPOSITION. NICHOLAS HOUSE ON BEHALF UNITED FARM WORKERS IN OPPOSITION IN LIKE ECHO THE COMMENTS STATED. JUST IT IT THANK YOU THANK YOU.

SAY GET YOUR BILLS ON CALL WILL WAIT FOR THE OTHER MEMBERS RETURN AND GIVE AT ON OKAY WE CAN ASK FOR. RECONSIDERATION WHEN WE FIND OUT THE RESULTS CORRECT IF YOU WISH. SO AGAIN YES IF YOU WISH. THANK YOU YOU'RE ON CALL FOR NOW WE WELCOME THE VICE CHAIR TO PRESENT AB TWENTY NINE OH SEVEN. AND LET'S LET ANYONE INTO. YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT. YOU DON'T KNOW IT YET BUT YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT. JERRY IT'S A PRIVILEGE TODAY TO PRESENT TO YOU. AB TWENTY NINE OH SEVEN AND I DO WANT TO JUST RECOGNIZE IT'S IN THE SAME VEIN WE'VE ALREADY HEARD TODAY. HOWEVER THIS IS A SIGNIFICANTLY OR SCALPEL APPROACH IN TRYING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT TED DO ARISE. ON SORT MORE THEY AGREE JUST ISSUES. IT'S AB TWENTY NINE OH SEVEN WOULD EXPAND THAT LIST OF ITEMIZE WAGE STATEMENT VIOLATIONS THAT EMPLOYERS CAN ATTEMPT TO CURE UNDER PAGA I WANT TO EMPHASIZE. THAT AB TWENTY NINE OF SEVEN DOES NOT ALLOW EMPLOYERS TO WRONGFULLY PAY. PAY LATE OR COMMIT ANY. ACTIVE WAGE SET THOSE ISSUES ARE CURRENTLY PROTECTED AND LABOR CODE LABOR CODE TOOL FOR. AND LABOR CODE ELEVEN EIGHTY TWO POINT TWELVE THIS BILL MERELY ALLOWS EMPLOYERS TO CORRECT AN ADVERT PRINTING AIRS. ON EMPLOYEE PAY STUBS. EACH YEAR THE STATE RECEIVES OR SIX THOUSAND NOTICES. OF A TENT OF PAGA LAWSUITS PAGA LAWSUITS CLAIM TO. CLAIMS HAVE INCREASED MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE. THE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN IN OVER TWO HUNDRED PERCENT SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN. ATTORNEY FEES. THE RESULT OF THE PARK WAS TO PROTECT EMPLOYEES. A CODIFIED EMPLOYEES RIGHTS IN LAW AND PROTECTED FROM POTENTIAL ABUSIVE EMPLOYERS. HOWARD HAS BECOME A SOURCE OF IMMENSE FRIVOLOUS AND ABUSE OF LITIGATION STRAIGHT AWAY FROM FROM PROTECTING EMPLOYEES RIGHTS. INSTEAD OF BECOMING THE CONTENTIOUS SOURCE OF INCOME FOR ATTORNEYS AND POLITIC LITIGATION FIRMS. THERE'S A COUPLE EXAMPLES ONE ATTORNEY FEES OF OVER SIXTEEN FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS EMPLOYEES RECEIVE AND FOURTEEN DOLLARS AND FIFTY THREE CENTS OF THAT. ANOTHER ONE ATTORNEY FEES OVER TWO AND THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. LAWYERS ARE GETTING SEVENTEEN DOLLARS AND NINETY TWO CENTS A THIRD ONE OVER TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN ATTORNEY FEES. EMPLOYERS ARE GETTING FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS. UNDER CURRENT PAGA LOCKED SO UNDER CURRENT LAW PAGA PROVIDES EMPLOYERS THE RIGHT TO CURE TWO. OF THE NINE PAYROLL REQUIREMENTS WE GET IT DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY AVENUE TO RECTIFY THE HEIRS RELATED TO THE SEVEN. PAYSTUB THE OTHER SEVEN PAYSTUB REQUIREMENTS. WE BELIEVE EMPLOYERS SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO CORRECT THEIR MISTAKES AND NOT BE AUTOMATICALLY PUNISHED FOR AN HONEST AIR. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE. IT IS UNLIKE UNLIKE MANY OTHER POTTER RELATED BILLS AB TWENTY NINE OH SEVEN DOES NOT CHANGE THE TIME PERIOD OR THE NUMBER OF TIMES AND YOUR EMPLOYER CAN'T YEAR. IT ONLY ALTERS WHICH PAYSTUB REQUIREMENTS EMPLOYERS ARE ALLOWED TO CARE. WITH ME TODAY I HAVE DAVID BOREN OF BUSINESS OWNER FROM MY DISTRICT AND FORMER SOMEONE WOMAN CRYSTAL SENT. TO TESTIFY MISTER BORING. THANK YOU VICE CHAIR FLOOR LET ME. FIRST OF KNOWLEDGE THAT A COLLEAGUE A FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER OLSON SUPERVISOR HONORABLE WELCOME BACK TO THE GREEN CARPET. WHENEVER YOU ARE READY. THANK YOU WELL MY NAME IS DAVID BORING FIRST TIME AND FOR YOUR GUY SO BEAR WITH ME. AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK I HAVE A SMALL AD AGENCY WE'VE BEEN THIRTY FIVE YEARS IN BUSINESS. LITERALLY STARTED WITH A HUNDRED DOLLARS IN MY GARAGE. AND I'M A BUILT UP OVER YEARS A VERY FAMILY ORIENTED BUSINESS WE HAVE ABOUT THIRTY EMPLOYEES. AND AND A LOT OF WAYS WERE VERY MUCH LIKE A FAMILY YOU KNOW WE GET TO KNOW THOSE EMPLOYEES WELL THEY THEY THEY. WE HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM IN THEIR. VERY EXTENSIVE RELATIONSHIPS. AND. OVER THE YEARS WE'VE HAD EVEN FORTY EMPLOYEES HAVE GONE ON TO ANOTHER JOB AND COME BACK FACT ACTUALLY WAS TEXTING WHEN THE KIDS COMING BACK TODAY AFTER SIXTEEN YEAR SOMEWHERE ELSE. SO WE'VE HAD GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR EMPLOYEES WE REALLY CARE ABOUT THEM WHEN THEY DO WELL BY THEM. WE GET BACK TO OUR COMMUNITY SERVE ON A LOT OF COMMITTEES DONATE TO ALLOW THE NON PROFITS. WERE WERE LITERALLY ONE OF THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES JUST WANTS TO ALWAYS DO AS BEST WE CAN FOR OUR COMMUNITY. WERE NOT A BIG BUSINESS IN TERMS OF REVENUE WERE TWO TO THREE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR SO WE'RE NOT ONE OF THOSE KIND OF EMPLOYERS. AND OFTENTIMES MY BUSINESS PARTNER AND I MOST OF THE STAFF IS WITHIN THIRTY TO FORTY PERCENT OF WHAT WE MAKE SO WE'RE NOT MAKING A LOT MORE THAN OUR EVEN OUR OUR EMPLOYEES. SO PRIOR TO PRAGA WE HAD NEVER ACTUALLY HAD ANYTHING BROUGHT AGAINST US WE NEVER HAD A LAWSUIT WE NEVER HAD A WORKERS COMP CLAIM. AND WE HAD NEVER HAD REALLY HAD ANY ANY ISSUES AT ALL THAT THAT CAME UP WITH EMPLOYEES. AND SO AS. WE WERE PRESENTED WITH A POCKET CASE. FIRST THING WE DID IS GET OUR RESEARCH WENT OUT QUICKLY AND WANTED TO MAKE SECURE AND WE ROUTE A VIOLATION FOR LEGAL NAME ONLY OR AND VIOLATION FOR NOT HAVING. A GLASS FOR THE SOCIAL SECURITY SO WE CURED THAT SEND THEM OUT TO ALL SEVENTY TWO EMPLOYEES THAT WORK FOR US OVER THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT WE WERE REQUIRED TO DO IT. SO NOW WORK LEFT EXPOSED BECAUSE WE DID NOT HERE WE DON'T HAVE A CURE FOR THE LAST FOR THE SOCIAL SECURITY WE'VE OBVIOUSLY HANDED THAT OUT TO ALL EMPLOYEES. SO. WE HAD THAT LITERALLY GO TO MEDIATION. AND THE THREAT OF WHAT WE WOULD HAVE TO PAY. GOING AGAINST A CLASS ACTION SUIT. YEAH I AM IN THIS WAY REALLY MADE US HAD TO SETTLE. AND DOWN IT WAS A REALLY HARD THING FOR COMPANY WE HAD TO TALK TO BANKRUPTCY ATTORNEYS AND LOOK AT IT REALLY SERIOUSLY BECAUSE. JUST ATTORNEYS FEES AS AS OF MISTER FLORA SAID. ALONE COULD JUST PUT US OUT OF BUSINESS. SO YOU HAVE ONE CLAIM. WE WE SOLVED IT MEDIATED IT. IT WAS THREE YEARS ABOUT ROUGHLY OF NET PROFIT FOR OUR COMPANY A ONE EMPLOYEE WERE STILL OUT THERE HUNG OUT TO DRY WITH ANYBODY ELSE THAT WANTS TO DO IT. NEVER EMPLOYEES THAT RECEIVE THIS INFORMATION SEVEN MONTHS AGO HAVE COME FORWARD WITH ANY ISSUES AND WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT WE JUST SEND IT TO A WOMAN. AND LET IT GO. BUT. FOR US IT COULD LITERALLY BE THE END OF OUR COMPANY BECAUSE WE'VE JUST SETTLED ONE. AND IT FEELS LIKE IT'S JUST. BUT. LANDMINES WAITING TO GO OFF EVERYWHERE WE'VE CURED IT WE'VE TAKEN CARE OF IT WE WERE USING. A LOCAL ACCOUNTING FIRM TO MAKE SURE WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE BIGGEST ONE IN A MARKET WE HAD A NATIONAL PAYROLL SERVICE THAT WE HAD OUR PAYROLL THROUGH. NONE OF THEM KNEW THAT THESE THINGS WERE ON THE BOOKS FOR CALIFORNIA SO. WE END UP HAVE MAKING AN HONEST MISTAKE AND. HAVE GREAT CONSEQUENCES FOR IT. AND SO. I'M JUST WRONGLY PLEADING THAT LOOK AT THESE THINGS IN THE PAGA. AT. THE VIOLATIONS OF AB SLASH FOR A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER AND I GOT IT DISCOVER CARD APPROVED YESTERDAY ON THE PHONE GIVING LAST FOR MY SOCIAL SECURITY. I DON'T KNOW HOW WE'RE HARMING AN EMPLOYEE THAT THAT'S NOT ON THERE WE'VE PUT IT BACK ON THERE BUT. THAT'S A VIOLATION. AND WERE OUT OF A LOT OF MONEY WE MAY NOT EVEN BE HERE NEXT YEAR BECAUSE OF IT SO THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS WELCOME THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN GOOD AFTERNOON I'M HERE ALSO EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR AB TWENTY NINE OH SEVEN FROM JOB CREATORS FOR WORKPLACE FAIRNESS. AS WELL AS A COMPANY IN THE CEMENT FLOORS DISTRICT VIP HOME SERVICE HOME CARE SERVICES. JOB CREATORS FOR WORKPLACE FAIRNESS IS A COALITION OF FAMILY OWNED BUSINESSES DEDICATED TO MAKING SURE THAT WAGE AND HOUR LAWS ARE FAIR FOR BOTH EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYERS. AS STATED AB TWENTY NINE OH SEVEN SIMPLY ALLOWS EMPLOYERS TO CORRECT INADVERTENT ERRORS ON EMPLOYEE PAY STUBS BEFORE THEY CAN BE SUED UNDER PAGA. UNFORTUNATELY PREDATORY ATTORNEYS HAVE GOTTEN RICH BY SEARCHING FOR THE SMALL ERRORS AND THEN TAKING ADVANTAGE OF INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES TO VICTIMIZE BOTH WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS. THESE FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS HAVE MORE THAN DOUBLED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS AND THEY ARE RAPIDLY SPREADING ACROSS THE STATE. I'D LIKE TO READ A STATEMENT FROM CANDACE BRIGHT SHE IS THE OWNER OF THE IP HOME CARE SERVICES WHICH IS LIKE THAT OF AN ASSEMBLY WOMAN ASSEMBLYMAN FLOREZ DISTRICT IN MODESTO. CANDACE SAYS MY NAME IS CANDICE BRIGHT NINE A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER I HAVE FOR RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES THAT SERVE TWENTY CHILDREN AND ADULTS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES WHO ALSO EXHIBIT SEVERE BEHAVIORAL ISSUES. WE HAVE ABOUT THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY EMPLOYEES AT ANY GIVEN TIME. RECENTLY WE HAD AN EMPLOYEE WHO HAS WORKED FOR US FOR THREE YEARS FILA PAGA CLAIM DO THE LAST FOUR DIGITS OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER NOT BEING ON HIS PAY STUB. IN MARCH WE DECIDED TO SWITCH FROM AN IN HOUSE PAYROLL SYSTEM TO A NEW ACCOUNTING FIRM AND WE DIDN'T ENSURE THAT ALL OF THE PAY STUBS WERE CORRECT. THE EMPLOYEE NEVER ADDRESSED HIS CONCERN WITH US OR THE ACCOUNTING FIRM. WE ARE CURRENTLY NEED DEEP AND ATTORNEYS FEES AT THIS POINT WE ARE CONTEMPLATING CLOSING OUR BUSINESS BECAUSE WE CAN'T AFFORD TO CONTINUE THE FIGHT WHEN WE DID NOTHING WRONG. THE RIGHT TO CURE ALL POINTS IS ESSENTIAL FOR US TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE A BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA. AS WE ALL KNOW IT'S REALLY HARD TO FIND ENOUGH HOMES TO SERVE PEOPLE WITH SEVERE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES. AND LET'S NOT MAKE IT EVEN HARDER BY ALLOWING THESE FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS TO CONTINUE AND PUT COMPANIES LIKE THIS OUT OF BUSINESS. WE SUPPORT AS JOB CREATORS FOR WORKPLACE FAIRNESS MAINTAINING THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF PACA WHICH IS TO PROTECT WORKERS FROM BAD ACTOR BUSINESSES. BUT THE LAW SHOULD NOT ALLOW ATTORNEYS TO VICTIMIZE WORKERS OR EMPLOYERS IN ORDER TO LINE THEIR OWN POCKETS AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY. SO PLEASE VOTE YES ON AB TWENTY NINE OH SEVEN. THANK YOU OTHERS WISHING TO ADD ON IN SUPPORT. AARON DRIVER WITH THE FAMILY BUSINESS ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. JOHN DORY WITH THE CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. KEVIN ANDERSON ON BEHALF OF THE RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS ASSOCIATION WESTERN CAR WASH ASSOCIATION OF FAMILY WINE MAKERS AND SUPPORT THANK YOU.

IF YOU. OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY NINE OH SEVEN. PLEASE COME FORWARD. I MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MARK CHUCK OF CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION. I'M HERE IN OPPOSITION DAY BE TWENTY NINE A SEVEN BECAUSE IT TRANSFORMS WHAT WAS INTENDED ORIGINALLY TO BE. A LIMITED SOLUTION FOR DEMAND IN THIS WAGE STATEMENT VIOLATIONS INTO SUCH A BROAD AND ENCOMPASSING. EXEMPTION THAT EVERYTHING IS CURABLE. INCLUDING THE ISSUANCE OF DELIBERATELY FALSIFIED PAY STUBS IT'S GOES FAR BEYOND THE ISSUE OF THE LAST FOUR DIGITS ON SOMEBODY'S PAYSTUB WE'VE WORKED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION WE WORKED WITH THE PREVIOUS CHAIRMAN OF THIS COMMITTEE. TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE INEQUITIES IN THAT HAVE BEEN REVEALED IN PAGA. FROM SOME OF THIS LITIGATION WE SUPPORTED THE CREATION OF A TEN ATTORNEY UNIT WITHIN THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY TO SCREEN. FOR ABUSIVE PAGA LAWSUITS WE THINK THAT THE THE LITIGATION THAT IS BEING TALKED ABOUT PRECEDED THE CREATION OF THIS UNIT AND OF THIS UNIT IS GIVEN. A CHANCE TO OPERATE I THINK MANY OF THE CONCERNS ARE GOING TO BE ADDRESSED BUT LET ME JUST QUICKLY SAY SOMETHING. ABOUT THE. IMPORTANCE OF THE ITEMIZE WHICH STATEMENT TO FARMWORKERS AND OTHER LOW WAGE WORKERS IN OUR THIRTY FIVE YEARS OF REPRESENTING LOW WAGE WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA WE FOUND IT'S EXTREMELY COMMON FOR CLIENTS OUR CLIENTS WAGE STATEMENTS TO CONTAIN FALSIFIED INFORMATION AND JUST LET ME READ THEM. GROSS CENTER NET WAGES EARNED DEDUCTIONS MADE FROM PAY TOTAL HOURS WORKED TOTAL HOURS WORKED EACH APPLICABLE HOURLY RATE TOTAL HOURS WORKED WORK AT EACH APPLICABLE PIECE RATE. THE OF THE FACT IS THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE PAY STUBS THERE'S A INCREDIBLE CONSISTENCY THESE FALSIFIED PAY STUBS. VIRTUALLY EVERY ERROR. MISTAKE. IN YOUR IT'S TO THE BENEFIT OF THE EMPLOYER AND NOT THE EMPLOYEE. IT'S ARE IT'S A PROFOUND ERROR FOR THIS COMMITTEE TO PASS A BILL THAT WILL MAKE THOSE KINDS OF DELIBERATE FALSIFIED WAGE STATEMENTS. CURABLE. SIMPLY BY THE ISSUANCE OF A. WAGE STUB THAT'S CORRECTED THE WORKERS NOT MADE HOLE AS THEY ARE ANOTHER CURE. CONSTANT EGG. ANOTHER CURE INSTANCES THIS IS A SPECIAL PURE PROVISION ONLY FOR WHAT WERE TO BE DEMAND IN THIS VIOLATIONS SO WE'D URGE AND NO VOTE ON THIS BILL. ADDITION OPPOSITION THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MICHAEL YOUNG THAT THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WERE ALSO OPPOSE THE BILL. ON ESSENTIALLY A MAKES THE SPACE OF VIOLATIONS NOT SERIOUS VIOLATIONS GIVEN THE EMPLOYER THE RIGHT. AS WE SAY IT'S BEFORE THE RIGHT SECURE ESSENTIALLY. ELIMINATE THE EMPLOYERS FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO UP WHILE THE LAW BECAUSE IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THERE ACTUALLY CALL VIOLATING THE LAW I HEAR SHE FACES NO PENALTY. BASICALLY EMPLOYERS GET THE GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO BREAK THE LAW AND SO THEY ARE CAUGHT IN ONLY BEEN A FACE ANY RECOURSE AND MAKE THE WORKER HOLE. A PIECE OF VIOLATIONS ARE OFTEN A REFLECTION OF A UNDERLYING BELIEF THAT AT THE WORKPLACE IF EMPLOYERS NO LONGER NEED TO. BE CONCERNED WITH PROVIDING AN ACCURATE PACE THE THE YOU'LL SEE A PROLIFERATION OF A WASTE THAT INABILITY FOR IMPORT FOR WORKERS SAID. STOOD TO GET RECORDS BUT AT LEAST THAT OF ADDITIONAL ADS LIKE SPEAKER BEFORE ME STATED THAT. THE LABOR FOR IT IN A NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS WORK WITH THIS COMMITTEE IN YEARS PAST TO. IMPLEMENT MORE STANDARD AND TIGHTENED STANDARDS. IN REGARDS TO HIGHER CLAIMS FOR PIZZA VIOLATIONS AND THERE IS A NEW STANDARD THIS IS THAT. WORKERS THAT CANNOT SHOW OF THE WRECK WITH RECORDS CAN ACTUALLY WRECK WITH A HARMLESS THEY'RE UNABLE TO DETERMINE FROM THE PEACE THE IF THEY WERE. IMPROPERLY PAID SO I WE WORK WITH THIS COMMITTEE IN THE PAST TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE BUT EXPANDING. EXPANDING THE RIGHT SECURE AGAIN WORLD I'M A EMPLOYERS ABILITY OR ELIMINATE THE IMPORTANT THINGS ABOUT OF THE LAW ULTIMATELY HARMING WORKERS AND FOR THOSE REASONS WERE OPPOSED. THANK YOU OTHERS WISHING TO ADD ON IN OPPOSITION JACQUI START WITH CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA ALSO IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. SHANE GUSMAN ON BEHALF OF THE TEAMSTERS AMALGAMATED TRANSIT UNION THE AL W. UNITE HERE THE OTHERS CAN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU.

THE GERMAN RECESS IDEAS WE HAVE THE STATE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SEEING. SOME AMERICANS ALSO FLETCHER I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THEY'RE THERE IS A LOT DISCUSSED ABOUT EMPLOYERS ENGAGE IN WHICH THAT TONIGHT IT DON'T THINK ANYWAY AND ONE. WAS ACCUSING HER OF THAT I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE IT SOUNDS LIKE YET AN HONEST MISTAKE THAT HOPEFULLY IN GOING FORWARD AND HOW ADDRESSING THIS WOULDN'T. I AT CONTINUE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THEY USE I MIGHT GET MY CONCERN HAS ALWAYS BEEN. THAT THIS WAS MEANT TO AUGMENT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S. ADAM. BUDGET. AND THE AMOUNT THAT ACTUALLY COMES BACK TO THE STATE OFTEN IS NOT IT IT. DOESN'T SEEM TO BE FOR FILLING. WHEN WHEN THERE ARE SETTLEMENTS. THAT. PURPOSE AND SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK I'M GIVEN OUR REFORMS WE SHOULD LET THEM SEE IF WHERE WE GOT AN AND POSSIBLY NAM VIEW THAT BECAUSE OUR LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE. SHOULD ARE THAT ARE YOU KNOW WE SHOULD BE DOING THIS WORK AND JUST DON'T HAVE. ON THE NECESSARY STAFF TO DO THAT SO I I UNDERSTAND AND I'VE HEARD FROM. INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO. KIND OF. A MISTAKE IN AND THAT'S NOT RIGHT EITHER SO I I JUST WOULD MAKE SURE THAT IT NO WAY WOULD I I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THE OPPONENT SAID BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF THAT BUT IT WASN'T DIRECTED. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SEEING NONE YOU DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND WOULD YOU LIKE CLOSE. OTHERS MAKE IT BRIEF YOU KNOW THIS IS I KNOW IT'S A VERY. FLUENT DISCUSSION THAT WE HAVE AND. THIS BILL WAS DRAFTED IN A VERY NARROWLY. WAY BECAUSE I DO THINK THERE ARE SOME DISCUSSIONS THE NEED TO START HAPPENING AS RELATES TO PAGA EMPIRE REFORM. THERE ARE SOME. GOODS ARE LEAVING OPPOSITION SAID THAT YOU KNOW THEY SUPPORT LIMITED SOLUTIONS. TO SOME OF THESE ISSUES. AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO GET TO WE WANT TO GET TO THE SOLUTIONS BECAUSE I DO THINK IF IT. A GOOD ACTOR WERE NOT WE WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH PROTECTING ABOUT ACTORS ABSOLUTELY NOT. BUDGET UNLIKE MR BORING AND THIS OTHER LADY AND AND QUITE FRANKLY THERE'S FOR OTHERS IN OUR DISTRICT THAT HAVE GONE TO THE SAME SYMBOLS SIMILAR THINGS. ARE DEALING WITH THIS IT DOES NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AND I WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH MISS FLETCHER ON THESE ISSUES IN THE COMMITTEE AND SO WE CAN FIND A SOLUTION THAT WE CAN ALL CAN AND. CAN AGREE ON SO APPRECIATE YOUR KIND OF. THANK YOU BYE SURE FLORA PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THURMAN. NO THURMOND NOW FLORA AYE FLORA AYE GONZALEZ FLETCHER. GONZALEZ FLETCHER NO JONES SAWYER KALRA MCCARTY MATHIS. MATHIS I. IT GOES ON CALL STILL CHANCE MCGEORGE VANNATTER. WE WELCOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL WHO IS HERE TO PRESENT AB THIRTY TO TWENTY TWO WELCOME SOME REMEMBER O'DONNELL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS A. B. THIRTY TWO TWENTY TWO DEFINES PUBLIC WORKS TO INCLUDE CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITY PROJECTS THAT RECEIVE FUNDING THROUGH CONDUIT REVENUE BONDS. THIS WOULD ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK ON THESE PROJECTS RECEIVE PREVAILING WAGE AND ALLOW THEM TO BENEFIT FROM APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. CONDUIT REVENUE BOND FINANCING IS CORNERED AND BY A NONPROFIT OR PUBLIC ENTITY. SUCH AS THE CHARTER SCHOOL FINANCING AUTHORITY UNDER THE TREASURER'S OFFICE. THE STATE LOSES REVENUE ON THESE BONDS AS INVESTORS DO NOT PAY TAXES IN TURN THE BORROWER BENEFITS BY RECEIVING LOWER INTEREST RATES. UNDER EXISTING LAW CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES THAT ARE FUNDED BY STATE EDUCATION BONDS ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH PREVAILING WAGE AND HIGHER. CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS UNDER THE FIELD ACT. PROJECTS THAT ARE FUNDED WITH CONDUIT BONDS DO NOT. WE MUST ENSURE THAT THOSE WORKING ON THE STATE SUBSIDIZED PROJECTS ARE SKILLED AND QUALIFIED. THEY PUT THEY ULTIMATELY PROVIDE A BETTER PRODUCT. THIS IS A POLICY THAT KEEPS GIVING. APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS MIDDLE CLASS JOBS HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON OUR ECONOMY AND FAMILIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL IS MODELED AFTER THE I A BILL THE COMMITTEE PASSED A FEW YEARS AGO DEFINING PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS TO INCLUDE GENERAL ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS. FUNDED BY CONDUIT BON REVENUE SO THIS IS NOT UNIQUE. OUR. POLICIES LIKE THIS ENSURE THAT A QUALITY PROJECT. THAT IS. DELIVERED ON TIME AND UNDER BUDGET AND WITH ME HERE TODAY'S CESAR DEALS FROM THE STATE CONSTRUCTION BUILDING TRADES COUNCIL. THANK YOU SO MEMBER WHAT THE FIRST WITNESS THE YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS HAS IDEAS ON BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL AT THANK. YOUR STAFF IN THIS COMMITTEE FOR LOOKING AT THIS. AND THE ANALYSIS AREN'T WE ARE REFERRING TO A SITUATION WHERE THERE IS A PUBLIC SUBSIDY IN OUR VIEW. AND. THE STATE LEGISLATURE HAS LOOKED AT VARIOUS WAYS DIFFERENT INNOVATIVE WAYS TO FUND DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROJECTS OVER TIME. AND AND SO IN DOING SO THE PREVAILING WAGE LAWS HAVE BEEN UPDATED TO CATCH UP TO THOSE DIFFERENT FINANCING MECHANISMS. ONE OF THOSE FINANCING MECHANISMS AS CONDUIT FINANCING. IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE THESE ARE PUBLIC FACILITIES OF SERVING THE PUBLIC. AND THEY ARE BEING SUBSIDIZED THROUGH THE CONDUIT FINANCING AS WAS STATED BY THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER THE ISSUER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING BACK THE DEBT. BUT IF THERE WAS ANY RISK. IT WOULD BE ON THE STATE OR THE PUBLIC ENTITY ITSELF BECAUSE OF THE CREDIT RATING THAT WOULD SUFFER. SO IN TERMS OF. PROVIDING MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR FINANCING FOR CHARTERS WE BELIEVE THAT. BEYOND THE SCHOOL BOND THE STATEWIDE SCHOOL BOND THAT HAS INCLUDED A CERTAIN PART PORTION OF AND THAT IT'S OVER. OVER. OVERDUE BASICALLY IN TERMS OF THE LONG LIST OF PROJECTS THAT ARE WAITING TO GET FUNDING FROM THAT. THERE'S ALSO DIFFERENT TYPES OF LOAN PROGRAMS THAT EXIST TO TRY TO HELP THE CHARTER SCHOOLS. THERE'S ALSO PROGRAM WHERE THE. PROVIDE THIRTY FIRST RIGHTS TO LOOK AT PUBLIC FACILITIES THAT A PARTICULAR SCHOOL DISTRICT TASK TO PROVIDE TO THE CHARTER SCHOOL ITSELF. SO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A MORE SOPHISTICATED FINANCING MECHANISM THAT SERVES THE LARGER PUBLIC UP IN THE CHARTER SCHOOLS OF. PROPOSALS MAINLY THOSE THAT GO TO THE C. S. HALF A. THOSE HAVE HIGHER LEVELS OF SCRUTINY. AND THEY'RE ALSO HAVE A GUARANTEE BASED ON THE EIGHTY A AND THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE TO BASICALLY GUARANTEE THAT THEY WILL GET THE FUNDING BACK SO. WHAT WE'RE SAYING AS THE SYSTEM GROWS? AND COMPETES WITH THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM THAT IS A. GOOD JOB PROVIDER FOR A LOT OF THE MEN AND WOMEN THE BUILDING TRAINS AND THE APPRENTICES THAT ARE GOING TO OUR PROGRAMS. THAT THESE THIS INVESTMENTS SHOULD NOT LEAVE BEHIND THOSE WORKERS WILL CREATE MORE EFFICIENCIES IN ACTUALLY CREATE SAFER WORK. LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS FOR THE STUDENTS AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU NEXT WEEK MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THE MEMBERS BOB JR ON BEHALF OF THE PAINTERS AND ALLIED TRADES BOTH DISTRICT COUNCIL THIRTY SIX IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND SIXTEEN IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE SUPPORT THE BILL I AGO MISTER. DE IS COMMENTS WE ALSO FEEL THIS IS THIS MAKES THE. SCHOOL SAVOR THE WORK FORCE IS MORE SKILLED AND THE PRODUCT IS BETTER. AND WE SUPPORT THE. THE CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THAT HE BERNACCHI ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE CONFERENCE THE PLUMBING HEATING A PIPING INDUSTRY THE NATIONAL ELECTRICAL CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION. AND UNITED CONTRACTORS A THIS BILL TRACKS WITH OTHER. PROCESSES AND POLICIES IN THIS AREA. MOST SPECIFICALLY WRITTEN LEGISLATION WAS PASSED IN THIS AREA RELATED CONDUIT REVENUE BONDS RECLINE PREVAILING WAGE WITH HOSPITAL DISTRICTS. ARM CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATIONS BELIEVES STRONGLY IN THE POLICY OF THAT THERE'S A PUBLIC BENEFIT THAT ISSUE TRAILER PREP PREVAILING WAGE AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE DRIVE OUT ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS MIKE MONEY GONNA BE HALF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS A CALIFORNIA STATE PARTRIDGE COUNCIL IN THE WESTERN STATES COUNCIL OF SHEET METAL WORKERS WERE IN STRONG SUPPORT DISS A. UP A NEW. PUBLIC INSTRUMENT USED TO FINANCE SCHOOLS HENCE IT SHOULD BE IN OF THE PREVAILING WAGE STATUTES THANK YOU THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO ADD ON IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBER SHARON GUSMAN ON BEHALF OF THE TEAMSTERS AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS DUBBED OVER SOME WE HAVE THE INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF THE BOILERMAKERS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. IT'S I MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MICHAEL YOUNGER THAT THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. IS THERE OPPOSITION. HE'S GOING FORWARD. PLEASE PROCEED. I FEEL KINDA LONELY APPEAR AFTER THAT LESSEN PERCENTAGE XIN BY THE SUPPORTERS. I'M DOMINIC THE MARI AND I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA TOOK. IN HERE OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. HOW COME I WILL BE BRIEF OF MY REMARKS? WE DON'T FEEL IT IS APPROPRIATE OR AT LEAST IN THE BEST INTEREST STUDENTS. HUB TO IMPOSE PREVAILING WAGE UPON SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS. I'M NOT THAT WE HAVE ANYTHING AGAINST PREVAILING WAGE ITS JUST THAT THE. SPONSORS OF THE BILL MENTIONED THE SORT OF BENEFITS THAT ACCRUE TO. THOSE WHO INVEST AND OR THOSE WHO BY BONDS THAT ARE MUNICIPAL BONDS WITH LOW INTEREST RATES. AND THOSE OUR BENEFITS THAT ACCRUED INVESTORS THE BENEFIT THAT ACCRUES TO THE CHARTER SCHOOL IS THEN PASSED IS REALLY BENEFIT THAT'S PASSED ON TO THE STUDENT WHICH IS. THE LOWER COST AVAILABLE OF THE MONEY AVAILABLE TO FINANCE SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION. SO WHEN WE PAY THAT LOWER INTEREST RATE OR WHEN WE GET THAT MONEY CHEAPER. THE BENEFIT THAT WE GET IS PASSED ON TO THE STUDENT IN BEING ABLE TO BUILD MORE BUILDINGS OR A BIGGER OR BETTER CAMPUS. AND SO I THINK THAT THE OFFSET THAT YOU'RE SEEKING HERE WITH THE PREVAILING WAGES IS SHIFTING. THAT BENEFIT AWAY FROM THE STUDENTS AND ONTO THE FINE MEN AND WOMEN WHO WERE IN THE BUILDING TRADES WHICH. WE FEEL YOU KNOW THEY SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BE COMPENSATED IN THE APPROPRIATE SITUATIONS. WE DON'T THINK THIS IS ONE OF THOSE APPROPRIATE SITUATIONS BECAUSE IT COMES AT THE EXPENSE OF THE STUDENTS AND THE FACILITIES THAT WOULD BE BUILT. WITHOUT MONEY WERE IT TO BE AT THE LOWER COST SO THAT IS OUR MAIN OBJECTIVE I THINK OUR MAIN OBJECTION. I THINK THE OTHER THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS IS THAT. WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CHARTER SCHOOLS THESE ARE NOT FOR PROFIT VENTURES THESE ARE NOT VENTURES THAT ARE. ON THEIR TO BE MAKING MONEY AND THEREFORE ARE GAINING SOME SORT PECUNIARY ADVANTAGE IN THE MARKETPLACE DUE TO THE LOWER INTEREST THESE OUR SCHOOLS THESE ARE PUBLIC SCHOOLS USING PUBLIC DOLLARS. EDUCATE STUDENTS AND THE SAVINGS THAT WE A CREW THROUGH THE LOWER INTEREST RATES AGAIN ARE. GIVEN TO THE STUDENTS TO BETTER FACILITIES AND SO THEREFORE WE OBJECT IN. ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL AND MY APOLOGIES TO THE AUTHOR I HAVE NOT BEEN BY HIS OFFICE TO SPEAK WITH HIM LIFE GOT IN THE WAY. AND IT WAS MY INTENTION TO DO SO BUT I HADN'T BUT. HITO FOR NOW WE WOULD OPPOSE IT AND I WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH MR O'DONNELL ON FINDING OTHER WAYS TO. HELP ACCOMPLISH HIS GOALS IT WHILE ACCOMPLISHING OURS AT THE SAME TIME. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION. I ALSO WISH TO ADD ON IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE WITH TRYING TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS.

THIRTY EIGHTY EN THIRTY EIGHTY ONE. IF YOU. TO. TO. WE READY WHEN YOU ARE. SINCE I HAVE SOME WITNESSES HERE STILL IN SUPPORT OF THIRTY. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. I LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED SOME OF THE STRONGEST WORKER PROTECTIONS IN THE COUNTRY. PART OF THOSE LAWS ARE WORTHLESS IF THEY CANNOT BE ENFORCED IN OUR COURT OR BY STATE AGENCIES BECAUSE EMPLOYERS FOR SOME WORKERS STOOD SIGNED AWAY THEIR RIGHTS. IN AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AS A CONDITION OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT. THIS INCLUDES VIOLATIONS SUCH AS SEXUAL HARASSMENT PAY INEQUITY OUTRIGHT DISCRIMINATION AND AGREE JUST LABOR VIOLATIONS LIKE WAGE THAT. MANDATING THAT EMPLOYEES GO TO ARBITRATION IS A PRACTICE THAT ALLOWS COMPANIES TO FORCE EMPLOYEE COMPLAINTS INTO SECRETIVE HEARINGS. WHICH HIDE LABOR VIOLATIONS FROM THE PUBLIC SILENCE VICTIMS WITH NON DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS AND OFTEN PROTECT SERIAL OFFENDERS. ARBITRATION CAN BE A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION METHOD WHEN BOTH PARTIES CHOOSE A FREELY. IT'S FAR LESS SUCCESSFUL WHEN THE MORE POWERFUL PARTY FORCES THE OTHER TO ACCEPT IT AS A CONDITION OF GETTING A JOB. THIS IS Y. A. B. THIRTY EIGHTY DOES NOT PROHIBIT EMPLOYERS FROM USING ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS RESOLVE WORKPLACE DISPUTES BUT INSTEAD IT SIMPLY REQUIRES THAT EMPLOYEES CHOOSE TO SIGN SUCH AGREEMENTS. AB THIRTY EIGHTY DOES NOT SEEK TO RENDER EXISTING ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS UNENFORCEABLE. IT SIMPLY PROVIDES INJUNCTIVE RELIEF WHEN PLAYERS ARE FORCING WORKERS TO WAIVE RIGHTS IN ORDER PURSUE A JOB. KEEP A JOB. OR INCREASE THEIR BENEFITS. AS ADDITIONAL PROTECTION A. B. THIRTY EIGHT INSURERS A WORKER OR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR IS NOT PROHIBITED FROM DISCLOSING ANY INSTANCES OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT THAT THEY SUFFER OR DISCOVER IN THE WORKPLACE IN ORDER TO PURSUE OR KEEP A JOB AND EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. ALL CONTRACTS MUST BE VOLUNTARY NOT THE RESULT OF COERCION INTO NINE TO WORKERS THEIR LIVELIHOOD ANY JOB THEY DO NOT SAVE SIGN A WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHTS IS ANYTHING BUT VOLUNTARY. THIS BILL TAKES NECESSARY STEPS TOWARDS PROTECTING EMPOWERING VICTIMS IN THE WORKPLACE FROM PORTION HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION HAVE A FEW FOLKS HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY. A REPRESENTATIVE IN OUT OF WORKER FROM THAT RESTAURANT OPPORTUNITIES CENTER. AND. KILLER BIGGER WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. IF YOU SEE MR CHEN MEMBERS KITTEN BAKER FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WHERE THE SPONSORS OF THE SPELL. WE AT THE LABOR FEDERATION HAVE NO HOSTILITY TO ARBITRATION AS A DISPUTE RESOLUTION MECHANISM WE HAVE SEEN IT WORK VERY EFFECTIVELY IN MANY CONTEXTS FOR EXAMPLE BETWEEN UNIONS AND EMPLOYERS WHERE THEY NEGOTIATE THE WAY THAT IT WORKS THEY TAKE TURNS STRIKING ARBITRATORS. AND THEY'RE ABLE TO USE THAT PROCESS VERY EFFECTIVELY MANY BUSINESSES USE THAT WITH EACH OTHER AND THEY'RE CERTAINLY EMPLOYEES WHO MIGHT CHOOSE AGAIN. APPRECIATE THE ARBITRATION PROCESS. THE PROBLEM WE SEE TODAY IS THAT SEVENTY PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA WORKERS DO NOT HAVE THAT CHOICE THEY ARE FORCED INTO THE EMPLOYERS ARBITRATION SYSTEM. I'M WITHOUT ANY ABILITY TO OBJECT RAISE QUESTIONS REFUSE IF THEY REFUSE THEY CAN BE FIRED THEY CAN BE DENIED THE JOB. ALL THIS BILL SAYS IS THAT THESE AGREEMENTS SHOULD BE CONSENSUAL A WORKER SHOULD BE GIVEN THE OPTION. THE ECONOMIC POLICY INSTITUTE JUST TO RELEASED A REPORT SHOWING THAT THE THREE GROUPS THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST RATE OF BEING I'M FORCED INTO ARBITRATION. ARE WOMEN WORKERS AFRICAN AMERICAN WORKERS AND LOW WAGE WORKERS HERBAL. HARASSMENT TO DISCRIMINATION AND TO WAGE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THOSE WORKERS BEING FORCED INTO. THE EMPLOYERS PRIVATE SECRET SYSTEM WITH NO CHOICE FOR ANY OTHER ALTERNATIVES THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT AND WE ARE VERY APPRECIATIVE. THAT THE RESTAURANT OPPORTUNITIES CENTER THAT ROBERTO CAME ALL THE WAY HERE TO TELL HIS STORY SO I'LL TURN IT OVER TO THAT BIG. I'M HELLO AGAIN MY NAME IS EVELYN WITH EVIDENT I HAD MAYBE NOW WITH THE REST ON OPPORTUNITY CENTER OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE ESTIMATE THAT IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT FIVE MILLION RESTAURANT WORKERS MOST OF WHICH ARE LOW WAGE WORKERS AND WE'RE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL.

THE DEFINITION OF INTERVENTION THE ACTUAL PROCESS OF INTERVENING. ARE AN EXAMPLE INTERFERENCE BY COUNTRY INTO ANOTHER'S AFFAIRS. THE ADMINISTRATION IS REPORTED TO BE CONSIDERING MILITARY INTERVENTION. ACTUAL DEFINITION ARBITRATION IS ONE OF THE VARIOUS METHODS THAT TOGETHER. ARE REFERRED TO AS ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION OR EDR. AS SUGGESTED BY THE NAME THE IDEA BEHIND METHODS OF AB ARE IS TO PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE TO FILING A LAWSUIT. AND GOING TO COURT. WHICH IS THE TRADITIONAL METHOD FOR RESOLVING LEGAL DISPUTES. WE SIMPLY WOULD ASK RESPECTIVELY THAT THE DO MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. THAT WE WOULD TURN THE RIGHTS OF ALL CITIZENS OF THE U. S.

THANK YOU THANK YOU RECOGNIZE THAT MANY OF THE WITNESSES OF WAITED LONG PERIODS OF TIME TODAY TO TESTIFIED WILL ALSO EXTEND THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME TO THE OPPOSITION. DO YOU I IS THERE OPPOSITION IF SO PLEASE COME FORWARD. THE MORNING THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JENNIFER BROWN HAVE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE ARE OPPOSED A. B. THIRTY EIGHTY I JUST WANT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WAS RAISED. BY THE PROPONENTS FOR SOME OF THE. ISSUES THAT WERE DISCUSSED BY THE WITNESS OUR LABOR CODE VIOLATIONS IN THOSE ALREADY AGAINST THE LAW AND THEY SHOULD BE. ON DEL WITHIN RESOLVES. WHETHER IT'S IN COURT OR ARBITRATION. ARBITRATION DOESN'T CHANGE THAT SO THERE WAS A DISCUSSION THAT SAID THAT. OUR LABOR LAWS ARE ONLY GOOD IF THEY CAN BE ENFORCED IN THAT ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS ARE SOMEHOW WAIVING THOSE RIGHTS THERE'S THAT SUPREME COURT DECISION IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT DECISION THAT SPECIFICALLY SAY. ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS CANNOT WAIT THE SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS THAT ARE OFFERED IN THE LAW YOU CAN'T DO IT. IF THEY ARE THERE ON FORCIBLE ALREADY IN THERE NOT A BALLOT ARE BETWEEN. SO YOU CANNOT WAIT SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS ON THE COURTS WILL STRIKE THOSE DOWN ON THERE ISN'T ALSO DISCUSSION THAT THIS WAS SOMEHOW A SECRET FORUM. A IN CALIFORNIA SPECIFICALLY THERE IS CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTION TWELVE NINETY FOUR OF EIGHTY NINE NOW. FOR NINETY ONE POINT NINETY SIX SOMETHING LIKE THAT ANYWAYS IT'S IN THE CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE TWELVE EIGHTY ONE POINT NINETY SIX. AND IT'S WE REQUIRES EVERY ARBITRATION COMPANY THAT CONDUCTS ARBITRATIONS HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO POST A QUARTERLY SEARCHABLE SPREADSHEET. THAT SETS FORTH THE IDENTITY OF THE PARTIES THE IDENTITY OF THE ATTORNEYS THE ALLEGATIONS AT ISSUE. WHAT'S HOW THE CASE WAS RESOLVED AND IF ANY OF THE COMPANIES HAVE BEEN AN ARBITRATION BEFORE IF ANY OF THE POP UP PLAINTIFFS HAVE BEEN AN ARBITRATION BEFORE ANY OF THE ATTORNEYS HAVE BEEN ARBITRATION BEFORE. HOW MUCH THE DAMAGES REQUEST WERE HOW MUCH WITH ULTIMATELY GIVEN HOW LONG IT TOOK FOR THE ARBITRATION TO TAKE PLACE THAT IS A A QUARTERLY REPORT? THAT'S POSTED ON THE WEBSITE OF EVERY ARBITRATION COMPANY WHO CONDUCTS ARBITRATIONS HERE YOU WOULD NEVER FIND A COME A PARABLE REPORT FOR THE COURTS IF YOU WANTED TO CREATE THAT SAME DOCUMENT. YOU WOULD HAVE TO GO COURT TO COURT TO COURT IN ALL OF THE COUNTIES AND TRY TO GATHER THAT INFORMATION TOGETHER YOU WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO FIND THAT INFORMATION CORDON SO ACTUALLY. ARBITRATION HEARING CALIFORNIA IS A MORE OPEN FORUM WITH MORE INFORMATION THAT'S PROVIDED IN COURT THERE'S ALWAYS A DISCUSSION THAT THEY NEED THEIR DAY IN COURT. IN IN NINETY OVER NINETY PERCENT OF THE CASES THEY SETTLE THE PLAINTIFF FOR INDIVIDUAL NEVER ACTUALLY SEES THE COURTROOM IF IT'S A CLASS ACTION THERE'S EVEN LESS CHANCE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET TO A COURTROOM. SO ARBITRATION ACTUALLY HAS A MORE OPEN AND TRANSPARENT PROCESS WITH REGARDS TO THE INFORMATION AND THE PARTIES INVOLVED THEN DOES I'M OUR COURT SYSTEM RIGHT NOW. THE OTHER POINT THAT HAS BEEN RAISED A COUPLE OF TIMES AND I THINK IN THE FACT SHEET WAS THAT. THAT THE ARBITRATION. WEEPY THE ARBITRATORS AND SO HOT SOMEHOW IT'S A BIAS SYSTEM UP THE LAW SAYS THAT COMPANIES HAVE TO PAY FOR ARBITRATION IF THERE WAS A. OPPORTUNITY TO SPLIT THE FEES COMPANIES WOULD BE HAPPY TO SHARE THE FEES BUT BY LIVE WERE FORCED TO PAY FOR THE ARBITRATION. A LOT OF THE ARBITRATORS ARE RETIRED JUDGES ON THERE'S ALWAYS A DISCUSSION ABOUT A RIGHT TO APPEAL THE ALLOWED FORTY SETS FORTH THE GROUNDS FROM WHICH YOU CAN APPEAL A DECISION. SO FOR THOSE REASONS I WITH REGARDS TO ARBITRATION OVER THE LAST POINT ON THE ARBITRATOR'S THANK YOU I'M IN ARBITRATION THERE'S ALSO A REQUIREMENT IN THE QUIKSILVER SEIZURE THAT THE ARBITRATOR BEFORE THEY EVEN GET PICKED TO BE AN ARBITRATOR. HOUSE TO DISCLOSE BASICALLY EVERY RELATIONSHIP THAT THEY POSSIBLY COULD HAVE HAD WITH ANYBODY INVOLVED IN THE ARBITRATION IF THEY HAVE. HAD A CASE IN WHICH THE COMPANY WAS INVOLVED IN THE ARBITRATION HOW THEY DECIDED THAT CASE THAT'S AN UNDERGOING DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS AGAIN THOSE SAME DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT REQUIRED FOR JUDGES SO A JUDGE COULD HAVE DECIDED THE CASE FOR A COMPANY THE DAY BEFORE. AND THE PLANE OF COMING INTO THAT CASE NEXT THEY WOULD NEVER KNOW THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS SO AGAIN ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES ARE THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED I DON'T THINK ARE. RELEVANT WITH REGARDS TO THIS ACT CALIFORNIA LAW THAT'S ALREADY IN PLACE IN THE LAST POINT IS. THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT IT'S PROBABLY PREEMPTED THE CASES BEEN VERY STRONG FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS FROM THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT FOR EVERY CASE HAD GONE UP TO THE SUPREME COURT. THAT ANYTIME A STATE STATUTE TRIES TO LIMIT PROHIBIT BAN ARBITRATION IT'S PREEMPTED THERE'S A BILL PENDING RIGHT NOW AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL BIPARTISAN BILL THAT SEEKS TO PROHIBIT. I'M SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIMS FROM GOING THROUGH OR BEING A PART OF THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT THAT'S WHERE THE DISCUSSION IS STATE ATTORNEY GENERALS HAVE WEIGHED IN AND SAID. EVERYBODY SHOULD SUPPORT THAT PROVISION THE FEDERAL ISSUE THAT SHOULD BE WHERE THE DISCUSSION IS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED. THANK YOU DISSOLUTION YES MISTER MEMBERS JOHN DORY ABOUT THE CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION A CALIFORNIA WANNA THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. OF THE AUTHOR ASSEMBLY WOMAN IS BRINGING FORWARD AN IMPORTANT PROBLEM WE'RE ALL AWARE OF IT ON IT NEEDS ATTENTION FOCUS AN ACTUAL SOLUTIONS. ON BUT UNFORTUNATELY EVERY PROPOSED SOLUTION IS NOT THE RIGHT ONE FOR THE ALL THE PARTIES INVOLVED. AS WRITTEN A. B. THIRTY EIGHTY CREATES AN ANTENNA BITE UNTENABLE DYNAMIC IT UNDERCUTS THE ABILITY TO SETTLE CASES. ON AND PROHIBITS NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS EVEN WHEN BOTH PARTIES DESIRE THEM. THE VAST MAJORITY OF FILED CIVIL LITIGATION IS SETTLED BY VOLUNTEERING BILLION AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PRO PARTY'S. CALIFORNIA HAS LONG HAD A SMART IN IMPORTANT POLICY THAT ACTUALLY ENCOURAGES SETTLEMENT THAT REDUCES CONFLICT. BECAUSE AMICALE AMICABLE RESOLUTION IS THE BEST WAY TO HANDLE THESE THINGS ARM AND ON TOP OF THAT IT PRESERVES VERY IMPORTANT. PRECIOUS PUBLIC RESOURCES UP SECTION FOR IN THE BILL SPECIFICALLY UNDERCUTS THE ABILITY TO SETTLE A CASE. ON THE OTHER. THE EFFECTIVE PROHIBITION WHICH MAY BE INTENTIONAL BUT THE EFFECT OF PROHIBITION IN THE BILL ON NON DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS IS ALSO PROBLEMATIC. ON THE CALVET CALIFORNIA FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING CLAIMS OF SOME OF THE MOST SENSITIVE ISSUES THAT ARE LITIGATED TODAY AND ELIMINATING ANDY A IS WILL NOT PROTECT CLAIMANTS. FOR THOSE REASONS AND THE REASONS ARTICULATED BY THE. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NOVA. THANK YOU OTHERS WISHES. ARE AND ON IN OPPOSITION. RICHARD MAY I JUST ADD ONE ADDITIONAL POINT ON THE ISSUE OF FAA PREEMPTION. SO IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE GOVERNOR VETOED A SIMILAR MEASURE THAT WOULD HAVE PROHIBITED ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS IN AND OF THE EMPLOYMENT CONTEXT. AS A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT. AND THE GOVERNOR IN VETOING THAT MEASURE CITED SOME PENDING U. S. SUPREME COURT LITIGATION. AND SHORTLY THEREAFTER IN DECEMBER THE U. S. SUPREME COURT ISSUED ITS DECISION IN DIRECT TV VERSES AMBROSIA. WHICH CRITICIZE A CALIFORNIA FOR DISCRIMINATING AGAINST CONSUMER ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS. AND THE U. S. SUPREME COURT SAID. CALIFORNIA PLAYED AN INVALID STATE LAW TO ONLY ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS AND NO OTHER CONTRACTS AND SUCH AN APPLICATION WOULD NOT PLACE ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS ON EQUAL FOOTING WITH OTHER CONTRACTS AND THEREFORE WAS PREEMPTED BY FEDERAL LAW. ADDITIONALLY LAST SPRING IN THE KINDRED NURSING HOMES CASE. WRITTEN BY JUSTICE KAGAN CERTAINLY NOT A MEMBER OF THE CONSERVATIVE WING OF THE U. S. SUPREME COURT. RULED IN A KENTUCKY CASE I ALSO PREEMPTION SO THE MOST RECENT DECISIONS OF THE U. S. SUPREME COURT HAVE CLEARLY STATED. AS. MISS BARRERA INDICATED THAT ANYTIME THAT YOU TREAT ARBITRATION DIFFERENTLY THAN OTHER TYPES OF CONTRACTS THEY ARE PREEMPTED BY FEDERAL LAW THERE FOR I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS MEASURE CAN PASS MUSTER THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS WISHING TO ADD ON IN OPPOSITION. ANKARA CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION ALSO OPPOSITION THANK YOU. KATIE HANSON CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU.

A BUT BUT THAT I'M NOT GONNA GO I I'D BE HAPPY TO. THE REFORM DEBATE AS A DEBATE OPPOSITION ON THIS ISSUE BECAUSE. THINK INTO IT CAN GILLESPIE'S MY EMPLOYER SKILLS AT ALL IS OFTEN AS I USED TO ENJOY. BUT. IN ANY CASE I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL. AND WE JUST LIKE TO. THANK THE AUTHOR EXITING THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE. ARM. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD UP ALTHOUGH IT IS IT'S A CHALLENGING ONE TO BRING POOR BECAUSE IT DOES BRING WITH IT A LOT OF FUN UP OPPOSITION BUT I THINK. THE REALITY IS THAT I I THINK THAT THE END OF THE DAY THE ACTUAL IMPACT. UP ON EMPLOYERS I THINK WILL BE NOMINAL BUT THE IMPACT ON WORKERS WILL BE SIGNIFICANT A A AND I THINK ULTIMATELY. WE ALL WANT TO HAVE WORKPLACES WHERE THE WORKERS AND THE EMPLOYERS ARE HARMONIOUS AND AND WORK WELL. WILL WITH ONE ANOTHER BY THAT'S ALWAYS THE CASE AND IN. THOSE CASES I THINK THAT THE THE WORKER XIN OF OPTIONS AS TO HOW THEY CHOOSE TO PROCEED. THEIR GRIEVANCES JUST AS EMPLOYERS TO HARPER KNOW HOW THOSE OPTIONS AND. OFTENTIMES HIM BACK GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHOOSE AND OUR CONTRACTS BUT ARBITRATION AND THERE. ARE NOT FORCED TO DO SO WHEN THEY DO THEIR PRIVATE PRIVATE. A INTERACTIONS AND SO I JUST LIKE TO THANK MISS RAMIREZ AT THE KEY MAY BE MAY HAVE STEPPED OUT. OF FOUR OF FOR HIS COURAGE OF LOSING YOUR REMAINS GLASSES PERSON UNLOAD. OUR COMPETITORS WHO ASTORIA PERSONAL PERSONALLY THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR PERSONAL STORY I WAS VERY MEANINGFUL. AND WITH THAT I'M OF THE. A MOTION AND A SECOND I'LL SECOND IT. WOULD YOU CARE CLOSE I JUST SAY THAT I'M THIS BILL HAS BEEN NARROWLY TAILORED IN A WAY THAT WE THINK WILL WILL AND WITHSTAND JUDICIAL SCRUTINY. THAT DOES NOT INVALIDATE AN EXISTING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT DOESN'T SEEK TO DO SO OR ANY ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WHAT SEEKS TO DO IS. PREVENT THAT TO BE A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT GOING FORWARD AND ALLOW INJUNCTIVE RELIEF TO PREVENT OUT SO. I APPRECIATE THE MOTION SECOND MY RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I MET. THANK YOU. THIS BILL HAS A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THURMOND AYE THURMAN AYE FLORA. FLORA KNOW GONZALEZ FLETCHER. AYE CONSULTS FLETCHER AYE JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER AYE KALRA. KALRA AYE MCCARTY MATHIS. THAT BILL IS OUT CONGRADULATIONS. IF YOU WISH TO PROCEED WITH AB THIRTY EIGHTY ONE YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THE ME TOO MOMENT IT'S GOT A LONG WAY TO FOR THE DIALOGUE ON HOW TO BETTER PROTECT WORKERS FROM SEXUAL HARASSMENT THE WORKPLACE HOWEVER THE EXPERIENCE OF WORKERS IN. AGRICULTURE OUT AGRICULTURE HOSPITALITY RETAIL RESTAURANT JANITORIAL IN OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES ARE FAR TOO OFTEN LET OUT OF THE CONVERSATION. PERPETRATORS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT THESE INDUSTRIES TEND AVOID BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE BECAUSE OF SUCH STARK WAGE AND POWER DIFFERENCES. THE WORKERS THEY HARASS FEAR BEING RETALIATE AGAINST OR BEING THREATENED DUE TO THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS OR BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY NEED THEIR PAYCHECK. AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THOSE LOW WAGE WORKERS ARE WOMEN AND LEAST A THIRD OF THOSE ARE WOMEN OF COLOR. THEY'RE THE MOST VULNERABLE TO HAVING THEIR LIVELIHOOD THREATENED WHEN THEY SUFFER SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT IN THE WORKPLACE. AB THIRTY EIGHTY ONE TAKES A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO ADDRESSING THE THREAT RETALIATION AS A BARRIER FOR WORKERS TRYING TO SECURE SAFETY AND JUSTICE IN THE WORKPLACE AFTER FACING SEXUAL HARASSMENT. THIS BILL WILL ENSURE A WORKER HAS AT LEAST THREE YEARS TO FILE SEXUAL HARASSMENT RETALIATE. RELATED RETALIATION CLAIM. WORKER CHOOSES TO FILE A CLAIM THE BILL ESTABLISH A NINETY DAY REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION OF UNLAWFUL RETALIATION ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL WILL HOLD LABOR CONTRACTORS ACCOUNTABLE BY REQUIRING CIVIL LIABILITY FOR CASES OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. ASSAULT AND DISCRIMINATION. UNDER THE SPELL WORKERS WOULD HAVE TO WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO A HOTLINE TO REPORT SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIMS TO LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE. AND MEANS TO SUBMIT A WRITTEN COMPLAINT THAT ALLOWS A WORKER THE OPTION TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS. FINALLY THIRTY EIGHTY ONE WOULD REQUIRE EMPLOYERS WITH AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES TO PROVIDE SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING TO ALL EMPLOYEES EVERY TWO YEARS. THIS BILL ALSO INCLUDES A REQUIREMENT FOR EMPLOYERS TO REGULARLY NOTIFY THEIR EMPLOYEES OF THEIR RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS REGARDING SEXUAL HARASSMENT. I THINK THIS IS MUCH NEEDED WE KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT ABOUT SEX THIS IS ABOUT POWER AND IN INDUSTRIES WHERE THE POWER DIFFERENTIAL IS THAT MUCH BIGGER IT'S. EVEN MORE NECESSARY. I RESPECT LAST NIGHT THAT. THANK YOU WHICH GUY FIRST WITNESS MISTER CHAIRMAN BRUCE CAITLYN VEGA FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR UP FEDERATION. WE WORKED WITH MS GONZALEZ FLETCHER TO TRY TO IDENTIFY GAPS IN THE LAW THAT WE THOUGHT WERE ON PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO PROTECTING SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE WOMEN WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA AND ALL WORKERS WHO FACE SEXUAL HARASSMENT. ON THE JOB AND IN PARTICULAR WE ALL KNOW THAT THE ISSUE OF RETALIATION IS ALWAYS CENTRAL IF WORKERS CANNOT COME FORWARD AND REPORT VIOLATIONS NOTHING WILL EVER CHANGE. AND SO WE THOUGHT THAT EXTENDING SOME OF THESE PROTECTIONS AROUND RETALIATION GIVING WORKERS MORE TIME TO COME FORWARD. AND IT MAKING IT EASIER TO ESTABLISH THAT YOU WERE RETALIATED AGAINST BECAUSE YOU COMPLAINED ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT AS EVERYONE KNOWS MOST WORKERS ARE OUT WILL CAN BE FIRED AT ANY TIME FOR ANY REASON. SO YOU FILE A SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIM YOU GET FIRED AND YOU SAVE THE WILL THAT'S NOT FAIR YOU'VE YOU FIRED ME BECAUSE I REPORTED SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND THEY SAY NO WE FREDDIE BECAUSE YOU RELATE ONCE WITH REGGIE BECAUSE WITHIN LIKE. THE WAY YOU ACTED YESTERDAY YOU CAN BE FIRED FOR ANY REASON THE BOSS HAS NO OBLIGATION TO PROVE I THAT THERE WAS A A COULD REASON FOR GETTING RID OF YOU SO IT'S VERY EASY TO RETALIATE AGAINST WORKERS. WHO FILE THOSE KINDS OF CLAIMS ARE ALSO OF COURSE WORKERS IN THE SUB CONTRACTED ECONOMY WE'VE SEEN A HUGE RISE IN THE USE OF TEMP WORKERS AND CONTRACT WORKERS? AND THOSE WORKERS ARE ALSO VERY VULNERABLE FOR THESE KINDS OF ABUSES AND WE'RE SAYING TO EMPLOYERS IF YOU WANNA USE LABOR CONTRACTORS TO SUPPLY YOUR WORKFORCE YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE NOT COMMITTING. SEXUAL ASSAULT SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THOSE WORKERS THAT'S OF THIS BUT THAT'S THINK YOU. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SHANE GUSMAN ON BEHALF OF THE TEAMSTER SAG AFTRA UNITE HERE MACHINIST. OF THE AMALGAMATED TRANSIT UNION OTHERS HOLLAND STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. ES MISS VEGA POINTED OUT THE RETALIATION A REALLY IS WHAT PREPARE PERPETUATES THE FEAR OF RETALIATION IN THE WORKPLACE WE SAW THAT IN ALL OF THEIR. HOLLYWOOD CASES. PEOPLE WERE AFRAID TO COME FORWARD BECAUSE THEY WERE FEARFUL THAT THEIR CAREER WOULD BE ENDED NOT JUST FIRED FROM THEIR CURRENT JOB BUT JUST DON IN THE INDUSTRY SO. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BILL AND WE ARE TO SUPPORT. THANK YOU OTHERS WISHING TO ADD ON IN SUPPORT. NICOLAS CHáVEZ ON BEHALF THE UNITED FARM WORKERS AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. TIFFANY PULLEYBLANK WITH THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA CHAPTER IN STRONG SUPPORT. IF YOU. MEGAN SUPERSONIC OVER THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. PLAN TROUT NO BEHALF OF CONSUMER ATTORNEYS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. WE'RE NAY BAYARDO SEIU CALIFORNIA SUPPORT. THANK YOU OTHERS WISHING TO ADD ON IN SUPPORT. VERY GOOD YOUR CHARLOTTE THE CALIFORNIA PLAN MILLERS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. THANK YOU. EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES OF JUSTICE DINNER IN SUPPORT OF THOSE ADDING ON IN SUPPORT SEEN NONE ZERO OPPOSITION. THE SUPPORT. I NEVER ASSUME THAT IS OPPOSITION AND THEN. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DAY WHEN THERE IS NO OPPOSITION. BUT WE WELCOME THE OPPOSITION. HELLO GOOD EVENING THIS TIME LARA CURTIS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND. THIS IS ALREADY PROTECTED UNDER THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT AND AND THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WENT THROUGH THAT THEIR RETALIATION FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIMS IS PROTECTED UNDER THE LAW THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING ACT SPECIFICALLY STATES. THAT RETALIATION IS NOT A LOT OF AN INDIVIDUAL MAKES A CLAIM FOR HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION YOU CANNOT RETALIATE AGAINST AN EMPLOYEE FOR MAKING THOSE CLAIMS. AND ADDITIONALLY THE SPECIFIC. ASPECTS OF THIS BILL ALSO STATE VERY. BUT THERE'S TRAINING REQUIREMENTS NOTICE REQUIREMENTS ALL OF THOSE REGARDING SEXUAL HARASSMENT AGAIN THOSE ARE ALREADY IN THE PROVISIONS OF THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING ACT. AND ADDITIONALLY MRS GONZALEZ FLETCHER HAD A PREVIOUS BILL REGARDING AND. REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH DISCRIMINATION AND LAST YEAR GOVERNOR BROWN IN HIS VETO MESSAGE SAID I BELIEVE THESE TYPES OF CLAIMS SHOULD REMAIN WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING. AND THAT BILL WAS ALSO PUTTING THE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND CLAIMS IN THE LABOR CODE AND AGAIN HE TOOK ONCE AGAIN STATED THAT IT SHOULD BE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING JURISDICTION. SO THOSE ARE SOME OF OUR CONCERNS AGAINST ADDITIONALLY THERE'S THE REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION CONCERN BECAUSE IF YOU MAKE A CLAIM FOR HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION. AND THEN THE NEXT DAY YOU STILL FROM YOUR EMPLOYER THERE IS A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION THAT YOU'RE FIRED BECAUSE OF THE HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION UNDER THIS BILL. BUT IF YOU AND THE THEATER THEREFORE THE EMPLOYER COULD NOT ACTUALLY TERMINATE YOU FOR BECAUSE REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE CAUSES IF YOU DO HAVE A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION SO THAT DOES CAUSE SOME CONCERN FOR US. ADDITIONALLY THEIR JOINT LIABILITY FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND BECAUSE ALL EMPLOYERS INCLUDING THE GOVERNMENT ALL EMPLOYERS THAT HAVE FIVE MORE EMPLOYEES ARE AND COVERED BY THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING SO EVEN THESE JOINT CONTRACTORS THE. INDIVIDUAL OR THE COMPANIES WHAT ARE TO BE COVERED BY FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING ACT AND SO IT. THERE'S NO WAY FOR SOMEONE ELSE THAT'S CONTRACTING WITH THEM TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE. COMPLYING WITH THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING ACT THEY THEY CANNOT OVERSEE THESE INDIVIDUALS THOSE INDIVIDUAL THOSE EMPLOYER SHOULD BE HELD LIABLE SEPARATELY. I THINK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME TODAY AND WE APPRECIATE. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON EVENING WAS VERY MEMBERS AS SEAN DOES THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESS REPRESENTING. OVER TWENTY THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS HERE IN OPPOSITION AS WELL FOR ALL THE REASONS VERY WELL ARTICULATED JUST NOW. BUT IN ADDITION TO THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR MEMBERS THAT AND IF I BE. I HAVE BETWEEN THREE AND TEN EMPLOYEES AND AS I PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED EARLIER IN THE COMMITTEE I THAT WHAT THAT MEANS FOR OUR MEMBERS AND SO MANY SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS IS THAT. THEY DON'T HAVE AN ENTIRE HR DEPARTMENT OR LOOKED AT OR COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENT LEGAL DEPARTMENT THEY DON'T HAVE ATTORNEYS AND A LOT OF EXPERTS AROUND THEM I'M EXPLAINING IN NAVIGATING ALL OF A VERY COMPLEX LABOR LAWS. AND UNFORTUNATELY I WE VIEW THIS BILL WOULD CREATE ADDITIONAL A CONFUSION IN THE LAW SPECIFICALLY WITH REGARD TO THE DEEP PIT DUPLICATIVE NATURE OF ADDING SEXUAL HARASSMENT PROTECTIONS AND TRAINING REQUIREMENTS DIRECTLY INTO THE LABOR CODE ITSELF. OF SUBTLY CONFUSING SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS BUT ALSO OPERATE OPENS OUR MEMBERS. TO ADDITIONAL AND A WHOLE NEW WAVE OF LAWSUITS UNDER PAGA WHICH WE ON A SEPARATE ISSUE THINK IS OVERDUE FOR REFORM ITSELF. BUT IT CERTAINLY. ADDS TO THE REASON THAT CALIFORNIA HAS CONSISTENTLY RANKED AS THE NUMBER ONE JUDICIAL HELL HOLE IN THE NATION FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW. WHEN YOU CONSIDER. LET THIS BILL DOESN'T ADD THAT'S AN OFFICIAL RANKING I CAN SEND YOU THE COMMITTEE. AND IT IS FOR THE AMERICAN TORT REFORM ASSOCIATION SOUTH WHEN YOU HAVE A LIGHT ON IMPUGN OUR STATE. IT'S NOT MY WORDS BUT THERE TO THE LEGISLATION AT HAND. THANK YOU. THE RANKING ASIDE. WHEN YOU JUST BOIL IT DOWN AND CONSIDER THAT THIS BILL REALLY WHEN WRITTEN LINES DOESN'T ADD ANY PROTECTIONS BEYOND WHAT FEEL HOT OR D. FE H. ALREADY PROVIDE. SUCH AS COMPENSATORY DAMAGES INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PUNITIVE DAMAGES AND ATTORNEY'S FEES INSTEAD ONLY ADDS COMPLICATION PATIL POTENTIAL LITIGATION A SPECIAL OR SMALL BUSINESS JOB CREATORS ARE WE DO UNFORTUNATELY OPPOSE THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS WISHING TO ADD ON IN OPPOSITION. SEE. PLEASE COME FORWARD. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO YOU DON'T HAVE. ALL THAT WE MUST. NICOLE RISE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURES AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION ALSO POST THANK YOU. KATIE KANSEN RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION OF POST BAKE YOU. UP TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE JUST TWO SMALL THINGS AND IF YOU STILL FROM YOUR EMPLOYER THAT GIVES THE EMPLOYER. THE REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION THAT THEY FIRED YOU FOR SUCH A HARASSMENT I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S A PRETTY CLEAR CASE RIGHT IT'S A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION THAT MEANS EMPLOYER COME IN AND SAY HEY YOU STOLE FROM ME AND IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT YOU CLAIMED. I'M SO I AM NOT SURE HOW. HOW THAT TAKES AWAY A RITE OF EMPLOYER THE OTHER THING THAT? ARGUE IN AND ONE THE REASONS I REALLY LIKE THE LABOR CODE. IS I DON'T THINK IT IT WILL INCREASE LITIGATION IN FACT THE HUT IT YOU KNOW IS A TOOL FOR LITIGATION IT ACTUALLY ALLOWS THE LABOR COMMISSIONER. IT ALLOWS AT AN INDIVIDUAL WORKER TO SEEK REMEDY THROUGH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER AND I THINK THAT THAT'S AN IMPORTANT TOOL AS WELL ON ONE WHICH. SOME WORKERS A WORKER REPRESENTATIVES ARE MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE WITH. AND SO I I WOULD LIKE TO EXPAND THE RIGHTS OF WORKERS AND SO THAT IS WHY WE. DOUBLE THAT BASICALLY SAU I RESPECTFULLY ASK AND I BET. TAKE YOU THIS BILL AT THE DO PASS RECOMMENDATION PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MOTION IS TO PASS TO JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THURMAN AYE THURMAN AYE FLORA. FLORA NO GONZALEZ FLETCHER AYE CONSULTS BUT YOU'RE AYE JONES SAWYER JONES SAWYER AYE KALRA. KALRA AYE MCCARTY MATHIS. THAT BILLS OUT CONGRATULATIONS. I THINK IT. SUMMIT MEMBER JONES SAWYER WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY SEVEN NINETY NINE. YES WE ARE WELCOME SIR. SO WHEN I STARTED SAID GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS SO I WILL NOW SAY GOOD EVENING MEMBERS. AB TWENTY SEVEN NINETY NINE WERE REQUIRED CANNABIS LICENSE APPLICANT PROVIDE A STATEMENT ALONG WITH THEIR APPLICATION AFFIRMING THAT THEY WILL EMPLOY ONE EMPLOYEE. AND ONE SUPERVISOR TRAIN AND CAL OSHA. SPECIFICALLY DISPEL RICARDO EMPLOYEES TO CAL OSHA THIRTY HOURS GENERAL INDUSTRY TRAINING WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE CANDIDATES APPLICANT RECEIVING THEIR LICENSE. AT THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY GROWS IT SHOULD BE A PRIORITY THAT CANVASSED BUSINESSES ARE FAMILIAR WITH CALIFORNIA'S WORKPLACE SAFETY REGULATIONS IN ORDER TO PREVENT NEEDLESS HARM TO WORKERS. REGARDLESS. ACQUIRING EMPLOYEES TO BE TRAINED IN CALLOSUM. STANDARDS WILL ENSURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND WORKPLACE SAFETY. WORKERS RIGHTS RESPONSIBILITIES OF EMPLOYERS AND HOW TO FILE COMPLAINTS. AND WITH ME TODAY TO TALK ABOUT IMPORTANT MEASURE IS. JAZZY. JEFF THE GROW FROM UFCW WESTERN STATES COUNCIL. RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU WHAT TEN WITNESS. AND MEMBERS GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS A GRANDMA AND I AROUND PATH OF UFCW WESTERN STATES COUNSEL. REPRESENTING MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND WORKERS INCLUDING MANY WORKING IN THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY. RIGHT IT REGULATING CANNABIS IS UNIQUE NEVER BEFORE IN THE HISTORY OF THE STATE HAS A WIDESPREAD INDUSTRY LONG SKILLED AT OPERATING OUTSIDE THE LAW. ALL THE SIDE IN BECOME LEGAL AND EXPECTED TO COMPLY WITH ALL LAWS. INCLUDING CRITICAL WORKPLACE SAFETY LAWS THAT PREVENT MY MEMBERS AND YOUR CONSTITUENTS FROM DYING BEING INJURED ARE FALLING ILL. JUST SOME OF THE HOUSES IN THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY INCLUDE HE LNS CARBON MONOXIDE FROM THE USE OF FUEL BURNING EQUIPMENT. FLAMMABLE CHEMICAL HAZARDS WHILE PERFORMING EXTRACTIONS ECCENTRIC. STAKEHOLDERS HAVE REPEATEDLY ATTESTED TO THIS NEW INDUSTRIES LACK OF AWARENESS OF THE CALLERS TO PROGRAM. BASIC EMPLOYER WORKER RESPONSIBILITIES AND WORKERS RIGHTS. THIS BILL WOULD SIMPLY REQUIRE APPLICANTS FOR ANY TYPE OF CANNABIS LICENSE. TO USE PROVIDE A STATEMENT THAT THE APPLICANT EMPLOYEES OR WILL EMPLOY WITHIN ONE YEAR OF RECEIVING A LICENSE JUST ONE SUPERVISOR AND JUST ONE EMPLOYEE. WHO WILL HAVE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED THE CALLER CHAU THIRTY OUR GENERAL INDUSTRY OUTREACH COURSE ON BEHALF OF MY MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR A FELLOW? THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WORK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MURS MITCH DYER WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. AS MUCH OF THE REALLY DOES OFFER AN A CAN OF PREVENTIVE IN PROACTIVE SOLUTION TO THE PRETTY UNIQUE CHALLENGE OF KEEPING WORKERS SAFE IN THIS INDUSTRY THAT. AGAIN AS MENTIONED HAS SINCE DAY ONE REALLY OPERATED OUTSIDE THE LAW AND SO THERE'S THERE'S A REAL CULTURE THEIR OF FINDING OTHER WAYS TO DEAL WITH PROBLEMS OF AN UNSAFE WORKPLACE USUALLY JUST. WORKING THROUGH IT. IF IT'S NOT A SITUATION WHERE WORKERS ARE FAMILIAR WITH CALLING THE STATE GOVERNMENT WITH PROBLEMS LIKE THIS AND SO. THAT CULTURES LIKE WE GONNA TAKE AWHILE TO TURN AROUND AND SO IN THE MEANTIME WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS CREATE A SITUATION WHERE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE MORE PEOPLE THERE. IN THESE WORKPLACES THAT ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE CALLUSES SYSTEM AND CAN LOOK AROUND AND SAY WE SHOULD DO THIS DIFFERENTLY WE SHOULD DO THAT DIFFERENTLY. ARM AND IN DOING SO IT'S REALLY AN OFFER A WIN WIN WHERE THE EMPLOYER IS GOING TO HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF WHAT THE RESPONSIBILITIES ARE UNDER THE LAW. THEIR LOT LESS LIKELY TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH CITATIONS THE EMPLOYEES ARE A LOT LESS LIKELY TO FACE HAZARDS AND GET INJURED AND. EVERYONE GETS TO FOCUS MORE ON THE WORK AT HAND RATHER THAN TRYING TO DEAL WITH INJURIES AND ILLNESSES AFTER THEY TAKE PLACE SO WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOUS OTHERS WISHING TO ADD ON AND SUPPORT. CHRIS FOR WHICH OF THE COALITION FOR HUMANE IMMIGRANT RIGHTS IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. KURT CAMPBELL SHOW ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED CANNABIS BUSINESS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU.

PROVIDES ENHANCED TRACKING PUBLIC ACCESS TO WORKPLACE INJURY AND ILLNESS INFORMATION INTO A SIXTEEN THERE ARE OVER TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION WORK RELATED INJURIES. AND ILLNESSES REPORTED IN THE U. S. THE PRIVATE SECTOR ALONE. THERE ARE FIFTY TWO HUNDRED WORK RELATED DEATHS THAT YEAR FEDERAL OSHA COLLECTS. ELECTRONIC DATA FROM MOST EMPLOYERS. AND LAST YEAR FEDERAL OSHA ISSUED A NOTICE OF RULE TO RELAX INJURY AND ILLNESS THAT WE THINK PUTS EMPLOYEES HEALTH AND SAFETY IN DANGER CAL OSHA ALSO REQUIRE SOME REPORTING. BUT DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT EMPLOYERS SUBMIT AN ANNUAL SUMMARY OF INJURIES AND ILLNESS. SINCE FEDERAL SHIRT MAY REDUCE REQUIREMENTS FOR ANGELENOS REPORTING IS UP TO CALIFORNIA TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT UNDER THIS BILL CAL OSHA WILL COLLECT THE ANNUAL SUMMARY INFORMATION. AND DEVELOP A SEARCHABLE DATABASE OF THAT INFORMATION ON ITS WEBSITE BY DOING SO. INFORMATION THE PUBLIC AND HAVE ACCESS TO CRITICAL WORKPLACE SAFETY INFORMATION THE DATABASE WILL CREATE TRANSPARENCY GIVING NEW EMPLOYEES ACCESS TO IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR WORKPLACE. STRONGER REPORTING REQUIREMENTS WILL HELP US UNDERSTAND WHAT CAUSES INJURIES THAT WORK AND HOW TO PREVENT THEM. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS MEASURE WITH ME TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL EMPHASIS IS. MAY CONSUMERS OF THE PERFECT CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MAY CONSUMERS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS AND WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS. BILL FORWARD OF TODAY THAT AS YOU KNOW PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS. IN CALIFORNIA ROUTINELY ARE TACKLING COMPLICATED LOVE LIFE THREATENING SCENARIOS AND REPORTING OF WORKPLACE INJURY AND ILLNESS. ILLNESSES IN CALIFORNIA IS REALLY IMPORTANT IMPORTANT FOR US TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE INJURIES THAT ARE OCCURRING IN THE STATE WHERE THEY'RE OCCURRING WHAT TYPES OF INJURIES ARE OCCURRING. EVER HAPPENING IT. AT DIFFERENT PLACES AT THE STATE DIFFERENT INJURIES OF SO REALLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING TO DO WITH THIS BILL. IS. REQUIRE THAT EMPLOYERS ARE ALREADY TO REQUIRE REQUIRED TO TRACK AND POST THIS INFORMATION IN THE WORKPLACE. TO REPORTED ELECTRONICALLY TO CAL OSHA AND ASK CAL OSHA TO DEVELOP THIS ONLINE SEARCHABLE DATABASE WHICH WE THINK WILL PROVIDE. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PUBLIC EMPLOYERS CURRENT EMPLOYEES AND PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYEES TO HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF WORKPLACE INJURIES AND ILLNESSES IN CALIFORNIA WHEN WHEN. THEY'RE LOOKING INTO PERSPECTIVE EMPLOYMENT. FOR THOSE REASONS WE WOULD ASK YOUR SUPPORT TODAY AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. IT WAS ARE CHAIR MEMBERS MITCH SNIDER WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THIS IMPROVE ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION WILL BE HELPFUL FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS PROBABLY PRIMARILY THAT. THE MORE THAT WE LEARNED ABOUT THE KIND OF INCIDENTS THAT ARE HAPPENING OUT THERE WITH THE KIND OF DETAIL THAT FOR FIRED IN THE SLOT THREE HUNDRED REPORTS IN THE MORE THAT WE CAN KIND OF. BILL THE HEALTH AND SAFETY INFRASTRUCTURE AROUND THAT INFORMATION AND SEE WHERE THE. EFFICIENCIES ARE MAYBE WHERE WE NEED TO TIGHTEN SOMETHING UP WHERE WE NEED TO CHANGE THE WORDING OF A DIFFERENT REGULATION AND SO WE CAN MAKE. NOT JUST THE SYSTEM WORK BETTER FOR AN INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYER AND SEE WHERE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS ARE THAT THEY MIGHT BE HAVING AND HELP. DO A BETTER JOB OF PREVENTING INJURIES IN THAT WORKPLACE BUT ALSO TAKE A LOOK AT THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE AND SEE WHAT BROADER AREAS WE NEED TO LOOK AT TO DO A BETTER JOB OF KEEPING WORKERS SAFE AND MAKING SURE THAT WE. PREVENT INJURIES BEFORE THEY OCCUR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYBODY ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEN ON ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. I WAITED ALL DAY FOR THE. MY ONLY BUILD TODAY SO I WILL BE BRIEF. WERE OPPOSED I'M MARTY FISHER CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OVER OPPOSED BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE VERY COSTLY TO DEVELOP THIS WEBSITE. ESTABLISH THE INFRASTRUCTURE ALSO COLLECTED MAINTAIN THE DOCUMENTS FOR FIVE YEARS AND RESPOND TO PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST. IN ADDITION TO THE THREE THREE HUNDRED A SUMMARY DOCUMENT THAT THE BILL. REQUIRES TO BE POSTED ON THE WEBSITE. THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES TO OTHER FORMS TO BE. COLLECTED AND MAINTAINED BY OSHA BUT AND THEN THEY WOULD JUST BE SUBJECT TO THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST. OF. SO WHAT IT DOES BASICALLY IS THAT CREATE IT HAS THE STATE CREATE THIS. LIST OF SHAME FOR EMPLOYERS AND THAT. CAN BE USED TO MISCONSTRUE AND DISTORT. THE MATTER THAT. IN A MANNER THAT DOESN'T REFLECT THE EMPLOYERS COMMITMENT TO WORKPLACE SAFETY. A WE DON'T THINK THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL ARE GOING TO ADVANCE WORKER PROTECTION IN ANY WAY BUT RATHER DIVERT SCARCE RESOURCES AWAY FROM IMPORTANT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. AND AND INSTEAD TO AN UNNECESSARY AND EXPENSIVE ADMINISTRATIVE. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. BRIAN LITTLE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION OPPOSITION FOR THE REASONS STATED BY MS FISHER. THE CALL RISE CALVARY MANUFACTURES AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION ALSO POST. KATIE HANSON RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION RIPOSTE. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE OPPOSITION SEEN NONE BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE. CHAIR WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. CULTURAL. MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS THURMAN AYE THURMAN AYE FLORA NO FLORA NO CONSOLES FLETCHER. GONZALEZ FLETCHER AYE JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER AYE KALRA MCCARTY. MATHIS. BILLS UNCLE SIR THANK YOU. SO THAT ALLEN. THE LAST ONE LAST MAN STANDING BEST WHILE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MEMBERS EACH YEAR. THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES SUPERSEDES THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. BUT LAST YEAR JERRY BROWN THE CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATS INTENTIONALLY IGNORED THIS FACT ENACTED SB FIFTY FOUR ANY BEFORE FIFTY. THE ILLEGAL SANCTUARY STATE LAWS. THE EXPRESS INTENT OF THESE LAWS WAS INTERFERE WITH THE ABILITY OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ENFORCE IMMIGRATION LAW. AN AREA WHICH IS GREAT EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION BY THE US CONSTITUTION. IT IS MY BELIEF. AS WELL AS WE THE US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THAT THESE LAWS ARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL INFRINGEMENT INFRINGEMENTS ON FEDERAL AUTHORITY. MY BILL AB TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY SEVEN WOULD UNDO THE DAMAGE INFLICTED BY AB FOR FIFTY. PLACES CALIFORNIA PLAYER SQUARELY IN THE CROSSFIRE DEMOCRATS POLITICAL DESTRUCTIVE WAR RESISTANCE. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AB FOUR FIFTY SUBJECTS CALIFORNIA PORTERS TO PENALTIES AND PROSECUTION IF THEY COOPER WITH FEDERAL IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES. IT EVEN GOES SO FAR AS TO MAKE IT ILLEGAL FOR AN EMPLOYER TO RECHECK EMPLOYEES IMMIGRATION STATUS. IF INFORMATION SERVICES THE EMPLOYEES ON IS UNDOCUMENTED. MEETING HERE ILLEGALLY. IT IS AGAINST FEDERAL LAW TO HIRE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AB FOR FIFTY BUT CALIFORNIA NO WITH THE POSITION OF DECIDING WHETHER THEY WANT TO BE PROSECUTED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SIMPLY PUT A BEFORE FIFTY IS UNJUST AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL. IS RECKLESS UNFAIR AND IMMORAL. IT TREATS THE EMPLOYERS OF THE STATE THE BUSINESS OWNERS AND THE RISK TAKERS WHO ACTUALLY CREATE JOBS. AND PROVIDE PEOPLE WITH OPPORTUNITY AS PAWNS IN THE IDEOLOGICAL WAR OF THE DEMOCRATS WHO ARE MORE CONCERNED WITH THE RIGHTS OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. THEN THOSE OF LAW ABIDING CITIZENS. AB TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN IS MEASURED IN A REASONABLE. IT SIMPLY PUTS THE CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT BACK ON THE SIDE OF JUSTICE FAIRNESS AND THE US CONSTITUTION. WITHOUT I URGE YOUR SUPPORT TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN. SO WE CAN REPEAL AB FOR FIFTY. THANK YOU PLEASE CALL YOUR FIRST WITNESS. NO WOULD ASSIST ANYONE WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT ANY SUPPORT ON THE MATTER. BUT SEEING NONE IS THERE OPPOSITION ON THE MATTER PLEASE COME FORWARD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRDS ARE NAY BAYARDO ES YOU YOU CALIFORNIA WHERE ONE OF THE SPONSORS OF AB FOR FIFTY. I THINK THE AUTHOR JUST HAS A WRONG SO AB FOR FIFTY IS DIRECTED AT THE ACTIVITY OF EMPLOYERS IT'S NOT. AS THE. AUTHOR RATE REPRESENTED SO. WHEN ICE COMES INTO A WORKPLACE. THEY ARE GONNA. IT WILL IMPACT IN EVERY PERSON IN THAT WORKPLACE INCLUDING. CITIZENS PERMANENT RESIDENTS ANYONEWITHIN THAT WORKPLACE WILL BE DETAINED THEIR RIGHTS WILL BE TAKEN AWAY FOR THAT TIME. AND CALIFORNIA ABSOLUTELY HAS A RIGHT. TO. GOVERNED THE LAWS THAT ARE HOME BUSINESSES HAVE TO APPLY BY AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT TELLS EMPLOYERS HOW THEY NEED TO RESPOND. AS HAS WHEN THAT YOU NEED TO ASK FOR A WARRANT THAT YOU NEED TO ASK FOR A SUBPOENA THAT'S FAIR THAT'S JUST IT'S LEGAL WE THINK IT'LL STAND UP IN COURT. THIS BILL. ALSO WAS MISREPRESENTED BY THE AUTHOR BECAUSE IT DOESN'T REPEAL AB FOR FIFTY IT ACTUALLY GOES MUCH FURTHER THAN THAT VIEWS REPELLING INDUSTRY JUST DELETED IT. ARM. THIS BILL ACTUALLY GIVES THE EMPLOYERS THE RIGHT. TO AT ANY TIME INVITE I SEE HIM. WHICH ACTUALLY WOULD COMPLAIN CONFLICT WITH CURRENT LAW ALSO A LIVER CHO TO FORTY FOUR BE. PREVENT EMPLOYERS FROM DISCRIMINATING AGAINST OUR THEIR WORKERS ON THE SPACES ARE THIS WOULD PUT THE LAW IN DIRECT CONFLICT WITH THAT COAT IT ALSO VIOLATES LABOR CODE TEN NINETEEN. I KEEP GOING THIS GETS ME WORKED UP I'M GONNA LET MICHAEL GO. THANK YOU AND IT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MICHAEL YOUNG A WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WERE ALSO ONE OF THE CO SPONSORS OF A EIGHTY FOUR FIFTY. THE PERMISSIVE THAT BILL WAS TO ENSURE THAT IMMIGRANT WORKERS ARE PROTECTED AT THE WORK SITE IN THE FACE OF. IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS A. AGAIN I WANNA LIMA CUMMINGS WITH. RENEE. BEAR WITH SEIU. IT'S OUR POSITION THAT. MISTER SIMPLY ASSEMBLY MEMBERS GONE MUCH FURTHER THEN ADD HE PORTRAYS HIS BILL THAT THE DANGERS PRESIDENT WHERE IT ALLOWS EMPLOYERS TO. IMPAIR OR ENCOURAGES EMPLOYERS TO. AND BUY ICE AGENTS INTO THE WORK SITE. WITH NO JUDICIAL REASON TO KNOW ABOUT REASON TO BE THERE. AGAIN THAT THE BILL THAT THE BILL ESSENTIALLY REPEAL THOSE VERY HARD AREN'T PROTECTIONS THAT WE FOUGHT FOR OF BOTH THROUGH THIS BODY AND WE NEGOTIATED STRONGLY NOT JUST WITH. THIS LEGISLATURE BUT WE WORK CLOSELY WITH A BUSINESS GROUP WE WORKED WITH COMMUNITY GROUPS TO DEAL WITH ANY ISSUES THEY HAD WON THE EMPLOYER SIDE ON THE COMMUNITY SIDE TO ENSURE THAT WE WERE. HAVING A ROBUST FEEL THAT. BOTH DEAL WITH ISSUES THAT MAKE SURE THAT WORKERS ARE PROTECTED WILL ALSO A WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE LAW. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT A BEFORE FIFTY ESSENTIALLY SAYS. THREE THINGS IT SAYS THAT YOU HAVE TO ASK FOR A WARRANT BEFORE YOU I THINK SINCE THE WORK SITE YOU GIVE EMPLOYERS NOTICE YOU GIVE EMPLOYEES EXCUSE ME NOTICE OF AYE AUDITS IN IT LIMITS AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW OR AS ALLOWABLE TO FEDERAL LAW. RE VERIFICATION ISSUES. AND WE WE FEEL THAT THOSE PROVISIONS WERE NECESSARY AND THAT WERE. ALLOWABLE UNDER BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL LAW AGAIN THE STATE HAS THE ABILITY TO A REGULATE CLEAR BEHAVIOR. AND WHILE THE STATE MIGHT BE LIMITED IN TERMS OF HOW THEY DEAL WITH IMMIGRATION ACTIONS THEY CAN'T AGAIN REGULATE EMPLOYER BEHAVIOR TO ENSURE THAT EMPLOYERS ARE MEETING THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO WORKERS EMPLOYERS HAD THE APPLICATION INSURE THEIR WORKERS PRIVACY RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED THEIR HEALTH AND SAFETY RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED. THIRTY PROCESS RIGHT TO PROTECT IT WHILE THAT WORKER IF AT THE WORK SITE WON'T WORK TIME. DISABILITIES IN THEM WHEELS GOES A LITTLE BIT TOO FAR WHERE IT PUTS WORKERS IN DANGER OF THE IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS WHERE WE KNOW IN THE PAST THAT SUCH RATES HAVE CAUSED. WORKERS RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS RIGHTS WERE VIOLATED WE'VE KNOWN INSTANCES WHERE. WORKERS MAY HAVE BEEN A CITIZEN AS I THINK IT'S AS WE HAVE BEEN DETAINED ELECT. LIKE THE BILL TO GET COUNSEL. SO AGAIN FOR THOSE REASONS RIPPLES. THANK YOU OTHERS WISHING TO ADD ON IN OPPOSITION AJUSCO SYNDROME HAVE EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES FOR ALL THE REASONS EXPLAINED IN VERY STRONG OPPOSITION. THANK YOU.

LOOK VERY SIMPLY. THIS IS NOT ABOUT DUE PROCESS. THERE IS. NOTHING. THAT SHOULD STOP FEDERAL IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES CARRYING OUT THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL DUTIES. ICE DOESN'T TAKE AWAY ANY RIGHTS OF ANY CITIZENS WHEN THEY RAID ANY WORKPLACE. AND IF THERE ARE ANY VIOLATIONSOF DUE PROCESS THOSE CAN CLEARLY BE REMEDIED IN THE COURTS. IT IS WELL WITHIN EVERY EMPLOYERS. LEGAL RIGHTS TO ENSURE THAT THEY ONLY HAVE A LEGAL WORKFORCE. AND LET'S BE VERY CLEAR THERE IS A VERY BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PEOPLE THAT ARE IMMIGRANTS TO OUR COUNTRY AND DELIVERY LEGALLY IMMIGRATED TO OUR COUNTRY. ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL DOES VERY SIMPLY AND VERY CLEARLY IS IT INSURES THAT THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION S. SUPREMACY OVER THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. AND IT CORRECTS THIS ILLEGAL AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRACTICE. OF THE ILLEGAL SANCTUARY STATE YOU MAY RECALL THAT I'VE I.
