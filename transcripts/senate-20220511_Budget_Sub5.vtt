WORKING IN INDUSTRIES ALL ACROSS

00:10:26.726 --> 00:10:28.361
THE STATE STRUGGLING TO SEE HOW

00:10:33.632 --> 00:10:35.134
SEEN COME UP FREQUENTLY FOR

00:10:35.201 --> 00:10:36.802
YEARS IS THE INACCESSIBILITY OF

DISABILITY INSURANCE TO

00:10:39.638 --> 00:10:42.041
CALIFORNIANS WITH LOW INCOMES.

00:10:42.108 --> 00:10:43.576
ALMOST ALL WORKERS ACROSS THE

STATE PAYS ALL FRACTION OF THEIR

00:10:45.177 --> 00:10:47.513
I'M INTO THE FIND. THE IDEA

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.448
BEING THAT THIS WILL WHEN THEY

00:10:49.515 --> 00:10:50.916
RECEIVE INCOME FROM THE FUNDS

00:10:50.983 --> 00:10:52.852
FOR FAMILY CAREGIVING FUNDING OR

00:10:52.918 --> 00:10:54.453
THEIR OWN HEALTH IT WILL ALLOW

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.589
THEM TO TAKE TIME OFF FROM WORK

00:10:56.655 --> 00:10:58.190
AND SURVIVE WITHOUT THEIR

00:10:58.257 --> 00:11:00.026
REGULAR WAGES. MOST WORKERS IN

00:11:00.092 --> 00:11:02.395
CALIFORNIA RECEIVE 60% OF THEIR

00:11:02.461 --> 00:11:04.497
REGULAR INCOME ON STI OR PAID

00:11:04.563 --> 00:11:06.465

00:11:06.532 --> 00:11:08.801
MAKING UNDER ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN

00:11:08.868 --> 00:11:09.835
THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY WILL

00:11:09.902 --> 00:11:12.304
RECEIVE 70% OF THEIR INCOME. SO

00:11:12.371 --> 00:11:14.173
NOT ONLY DOES THIS NOT PROVIDE

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.175
ENOUGH INCOME BECAUSE IT ASSUMES

00:11:16.242 --> 00:11:17.643
THAT THE LOWEST WAGE

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:20.212
CALIFORNIANS CAN AFFORD TO GET

00:11:20.279 --> 00:11:22.581
30% OF THEIR INCOME. EIGHT FOUR

00:11:22.648 --> 00:11:23.916
DO YOU LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS

00:11:23.983 --> 00:11:28.020

THE- WORKERS. ENFOLDS MINIMUM

00:11:33.726 --> 00:11:35.628
WAGE WORKERS IT DRAWS THE LINE

00:11:35.694 --> 00:11:37.029
ADDED IN LEVELS LOW THAT IN A

00:11:37.096 --> 00:11:38.931
TWO INCOME HOUSEHOLD TO PARENTS

00:11:38.998 --> 00:11:40.499

00:11:40.566 --> 00:11:42.334
EVEN COVER THE BASIC COSTS OF

00:11:42.401 --> 00:11:43.736

LESS LOS ANGELES OR THE BAY AREA

00:11:48.607 --> 00:11:50.176
AND WE'VE SEEN THIS BORN OUT IN

00:11:50.242 --> 00:11:53.946

OF THEIR INCOME AS WELL AS THE

00:12:15.534 --> 00:12:16.902
DAD WHO WAS ONLY ABLE TO SPEND

00:12:16.969 --> 00:12:18.604
TWO HOURS WITH HIS NEW BABY AND

00:12:18.671 --> 00:12:21.373

AND DOCTORS HAVE SHARED WITH US

00:12:23.943 --> 00:12:25.611
HOW LOW WAGE REPLACEMENT RATES

00:12:25.678 --> 00:12:26.378
HAVE INTERFERED WITH THEIR

00:12:26.445 --> 00:12:28.214
PATIENT CARE. A HUSBAND AND

DELAYING TREATMENT FOR TOO LONG.

00:12:33.619 --> 00:12:34.787

NO OTHER CHOICE. AND IT RESULTED

00:12:46.732 --> 00:12:48.200
IN AVOIDABLE EMERGENCY CARE.

00:12:48.267 --> 00:12:49.802
I'VE SPOKEN WITH NEW MOTHERS FOR

00:12:49.869 --> 00:12:51.871
WHOM THE IDEA THAT THEY COULD

00:12:51.937 --> 00:12:52.638
LIVE OFF OF 60% OF THEIR INCOME

00:12:52.705 --> 00:12:54.306
WAS SO ABSURD THAT THEY DIDN'T

00:12:54.373 --> 00:12:55.908
UNDERSTAND HOW THIS COULD BE HOW

00:12:55.975 --> 00:12:56.976
THE PROGRAM WAS ACTUALLY

00:12:57.042 --> 00:12:58.944
DESIGNED. CALIFORNIA NEEDS A

00:12:59.011 --> 00:13:00.813
PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES 90% OF

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.648
INCOME TO LOWER WAGE WORKERS.

00:13:02.715 --> 00:13:04.283

WELL OF I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL

00:13:24.803 --> 00:13:28.107
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT- YOU KNOW

00:13:28.174 --> 00:13:31.043
MANY OF US HAVE ENCOUNTERED IN

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:35.447
OUR WORK- AS FAR AS YOUR LOW

00:13:35.514 --> 00:13:38.450
WAGE. YOUR LOW WAGE WORKER

00:13:38.517 --> 00:13:40.419
YOU'RE TRYING TO SPEND TIME WITH

00:13:40.486 --> 00:13:42.354
YOUR FAMILY WHETHER IT'S A AN

00:13:42.421 --> 00:13:46.091
ELDERLY. PERSON WHO MAY BE ILL

00:13:46.158 --> 00:13:50.029
OR YOUR NEWBORN BABY- THESE ARE

00:13:50.095 --> 00:13:53.566
ALL SORT OF THINGS THAT WE SAY

00:13:53.632 --> 00:13:55.935
WE KNOW MAKE YOUR- MONGER UP.

00:13:56.001 --> 00:13:58.270
MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO HAVE

00:13:58.337 --> 00:13:59.738
THE KIND OF RELATIONSHIP WITH

00:13:59.805 --> 00:14:01.073
YOUR FAMILY THAT THAT

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:02.975
STRENGTHENS IT LEADS TO A

00:14:03.042 --> 00:14:05.511
STRONGER COMMUNITY- SO I THINK

00:14:05.578 --> 00:14:07.046
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT

00:14:07.112 --> 00:14:09.748
ARE IMPACTED BY THIS THAT IT'S-

00:14:09.815 --> 00:14:10.916
KIND OF EMBARRASSING THAT

00:14:10.983 --> 00:14:13.085
CALIFORNIA'S THE LOW COMPARED

00:14:13.152 --> 00:14:15.421
TO- COMPARED TO OTHER STATES AS

00:14:15.487 --> 00:14:18.357
FAR AS WHAT WE ACTUALLY-

00:14:18.424 --> 00:14:21.894
PROVIDE. AND I THINK THE LAST

00:14:21.961 --> 00:14:24.563
POINT IS THAT THIS IS A BENEFIT

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:27.132
THAT'S PAID FOR BY THE WORKERS

00:14:27.199 --> 00:14:28.033
THEMSELVES. LAWYERS DO NOT

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:31.270
CONTRIBUTE BUT SO BEING ABLE TO

00:14:31.337 --> 00:14:32.838
UTILIZE SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE

00:14:32.905 --> 00:14:35.941
PAYING INTO I THINK IS THE MOST

00:14:36.008 --> 00:14:38.711
FAIR THING THAT WE CAN DO

00:14:38.777 --> 00:14:40.679
BESIDES THE STRENGTH THAT IT

00:14:40.746 --> 00:14:44.683
PROVIDES FOR OUR- FAMILY. OF I'M

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:47.920
REALLY PROUD OF THIS AS-

00:14:47.987 --> 00:14:49.655
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO-

00:14:49.722 --> 00:14:52.858
URGE THE- GOVERNOR TO ACCEPT IN

00:14:52.925 --> 00:14:57.863

BEEN A DOING THIS LABOR WORK ALL

01:21:53.375 --> 01:21:55.477
MY LIFE AND THE ROLE OF

01:21:55.543 --> 01:21:58.113
GOVERNMENT IS REALLY IMPORTANT

01:21:58.179 --> 01:22:00.148
TO MAKE SURE THAT ESPECIALLY LOW

01:22:00.215 --> 01:22:03.952

WHICH IS WHERE THE MOST

01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:06.855
EXPLOITATION TAKES PLACE SO I'M

01:22:06.921 --> 01:22:10.659
VERY VERY CONCERNED- ABOUT THE

01:22:10.725 --> 01:22:13.261
DIRECT IMPACT THAT THE LACK OF

01:22:20.235 --> 01:22:22.304

COMMUNITIES THOSE VULNERABLE

01:22:23.705 --> 01:22:25.540

01:22:27.008 --> 01:22:28.710
THEY'VE BEEN HIT THE HARDEST.

01:22:28.777 --> 01:22:30.712
THEY NEED THE MOST ATTENTION

01:22:30.779 --> 01:22:34.082

REIMBURSEMENT THAT THE

01:47:55.168 --> 01:47:58.205
ADMINISTRATIVE IN A DEEP WOULD.

01:47:58.271 --> 01:48:02.108
INITIATE THOSE PROGRAMS-

01:48:02.175 --> 01:48:03.777
AUTOMATICALLY RATHER THAN HAVING

01:48:03.844 --> 01:48:05.478
A BUSINESS NEED TO COME FORTH

01:48:05.545 --> 01:48:09.449
AND PRO ACTIVELY- REQUEST OR OR

MAKE A CLAIM FOR REIMBURSEMENT.

01:48:13.353 --> 01:48:14.788
THAT THAT'S OCCURRING OBVIOUSLY

01:48:14.855 --> 01:48:16.423
THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS FROM

01:48:16.489 --> 01:48:18.191
WE CAN WHEN WE LOOK BACK OVER

01:48:18.258 --> 01:48:19.392
THE LAST. COUPLE YEARS FISH AND

01:48:19.459 --> 01:48:21.595
THINGS LIKE WOULD YOU KNOW RENT

01:48:21.661 --> 01:48:22.562
RELIEF YOU KNOW THAT THAT HAS

01:48:22.629 --> 01:48:23.563
BEEN A STICKING POINT WHERE

01:48:23.630 --> 01:48:25.999
UNCLEAR. ESPECIALLY LIKE ACROSS

01:48:26.066 --> 01:48:27.634
THE CALENDAR LIKE WHEN PEOPLE

01:48:27.701 --> 01:48:29.336
KNEW ABOUT IT NOW THEY WERE YOU

01:48:29.402 --> 01:48:30.971

01:48:31.037 --> 01:48:34.040
TO THE C. THANK YOU. MISTER- I

01:48:34.107 --> 01:48:36.443
HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS THE

01:48:36.509 --> 01:48:38.345
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO WE

01:48:38.411 --> 01:48:40.847
COULD REMIND ME ONE IS ON AS FAR

01:48:40.914 --> 01:48:43.350
AS YOU AYE COST. IS FOR SMALL

01:48:43.416 --> 01:48:46.119
BUSINESSES WITH UP TO FIFTY TWO

01:48:46.186 --> 01:48:47.487
HUNDRED FIFTY EMPLOYEES. AND

01:48:47.554 --> 01:48:50.190
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S AN EASIER THING

01:48:50.257 --> 01:48:52.993
IT'S A REBATE SYSTEM. THE RELIEF

01:48:53.059 --> 01:48:56.563
OF GRANT FOR PAID SICK LEAVE

01:48:56.630 --> 01:49:00.000
COSTS IS FOR BOTH SMALL BUSINESS

01:49:00.066 --> 01:49:03.003
AND NONPROFITS UP TO A HUNDRED

01:49:03.069 --> 01:49:04.738
FIFTY EMPLOYEES. OF AND THAT'S

01:49:04.804 --> 01:49:07.741
THROUGH A GRANT PROGRAM COULD.

01:49:07.807 --> 01:49:10.677
OF COULD YOU TALK ABOUT WHY THAT

01:49:10.744 --> 01:49:12.646
THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO

01:49:12.712 --> 01:49:15.382
I BEEN- APPROACH BY THE NUMBER

01:49:15.448 --> 01:49:16.783
OF NON PROFITS WERE REALLY

01:49:16.850 --> 01:49:21.221
CONCERNED ABOUT THE CAP. OF YOU

01:49:21.288 --> 01:49:23.556
KNOW BEING BEING CAPPED AT A

01:49:23.623 --> 01:49:24.758
HUNDRED FIFTY EMPLOYEES THEIR

01:49:24.824 --> 01:49:27.694
NONPROFITS AND SO OBVIOUSLY SEE

01:49:27.761 --> 01:49:29.796
THEMSELVES AND ALSO THEIR

01:49:29.863 --> 01:49:32.232
ABILITY TO ACCESS I THINK

01:49:32.299 --> 01:49:35.068
BECOMES MORE DIFFICULT TO MORE

01:49:35.135 --> 01:49:36.870
COMPLICATED THEY GO THROUGH A

01:49:36.937 --> 01:49:40.040
GRANT. OF PROGRAM SO ANY

01:49:40.106 --> 01:49:42.676
THOUGHTS ON HOW TO ADDRESS THAT

01:49:42.742 --> 01:49:45.545
. OF COURSE SENATOR DORADO- TO

01:49:45.612 --> 01:49:47.347
YOUR FIRST QUESTION ABOUT THE

01:49:47.414 --> 01:49:49.816
ADMINISTRATIVE ENTITIES ON FOR

01:49:49.883 --> 01:49:52.419
THE U. I. COST REIMBURSEMENT THE

01:49:52.485 --> 01:49:54.988
STATE HAS REPLIED MINISTRY TO

01:49:55.055 --> 01:49:57.157
ADVANTAGE OF KNOWING A GREAT

01:49:57.223 --> 01:49:59.859
DEAL ABOUT THE EMPLOYERS YOU WHY

01:49:59.926 --> 01:50:01.861
COSTS INCLUDING THE INCREASED

01:50:01.928 --> 01:50:03.663
FEDERAL YOU AYE COST BECAUSE OF

01:50:03.730 --> 01:50:04.864
THE CLOSE RELATIONSHIP THAT THE

01:50:04.931 --> 01:50:06.967
EMPLOYER COMMUNITY HAS. WITH THE

01:50:07.033 --> 01:50:07.734
EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT

01:50:07.801 --> 01:50:08.902
DEPARTMENT WHO OVERSEES THE

01:50:08.969 --> 01:50:12.238
PROGRAM SO IT'S A NATURAL.

01:50:12.305 --> 01:50:14.441
PROPOSAL TO HAVE ON THE STATE

01:50:14.507 --> 01:50:16.009
DIRECTLY TO MINISTER THAT

01:50:16.076 --> 01:50:17.777
REIMBURSED BACK ON FOR THE PAIN

01:50:17.844 --> 01:50:20.647
SICK LEAVE. PROVISIONS THAT

01:50:20.714 --> 01:50:22.682
THERE DOESN'T EXIST THE SAME

01:50:22.749 --> 01:50:24.985
NATURAL- OVERSIGHT OR

01:50:25.051 --> 01:50:27.087
ADMINISTERING ENTITY AND THIS IS

01:50:27.153 --> 01:50:28.621
AS I UNDERSTAND IT THE REASON

01:50:28.688 --> 01:50:30.457
WHY A GRAND ADMINISTRATOR HAS

01:50:30.523 --> 01:50:32.559
BEEN PROPOSED- THERE ARE PROS

01:50:32.625 --> 01:50:34.627
AND CONS WITH WITH GOING FOR THE

01:50:34.694 --> 01:50:36.596
ADMINISTRATOR BUT I IN THE

01:50:36.663 --> 01:50:38.431
ABSENCE OF SUCH A CLEAR STATE

01:50:38.498 --> 01:50:40.533
ENTITY- IT'S OBVIOUSLY ONE OF

01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:44.137
THE- THE- MOST VIABLE

01:50:44.204 --> 01:50:45.372
ALTERNATIVES. YOUR SECOND

01:50:45.438 --> 01:50:47.440
QUESTION SENATOR ALSO ABOUT THE-

01:50:47.507 --> 01:50:49.809
THE SCOPE OF BUSINESS SIZE OR

01:50:49.876 --> 01:50:51.211
NONPROFIT SIZE IT WOULD BE

01:50:51.277 --> 01:50:53.179
ELIGIBLE FOR RELIEF THAT REALLY

01:50:53.246 --> 01:50:55.215
IS A QUESTION FOR THE SUB

01:50:55.281 --> 01:50:56.983
COMMITTEE AND FOR THE SENATE TO

01:50:57.050 --> 01:50:58.218
DETERMINE ITS IN IN ITS

01:50:58.284 --> 01:51:01.755
PRIORITIES. OBVIOUSLY EXPANDING-

01:51:01.821 --> 01:51:04.457
ABOVE. TO LARGER EMPLOYERS IN IN

01:51:04.524 --> 01:51:06.159
EITHER PROGRAM WOULD INCREASE

01:51:06.226 --> 01:51:09.496
STATE COSTS FOR THE GRANTS-

01:51:09.562 --> 01:51:10.930
WHILE HAVING A MORE RESTRICTED

01:51:10.997 --> 01:51:11.965
PROGRAM THAT'S MORE NARROWLY

01:51:12.032 --> 01:51:13.400
TARGETED SMALLER BUSINESSES AND

01:51:13.466 --> 01:51:15.235
NONPROFITS WHICH WOULD DECREASE

01:51:15.301 --> 01:51:16.369
STATE COSTS RELATIVE TO THE

01:51:16.436 --> 01:51:18.538
CURRENT PROPOSAL. I MEAN THAT'S

01:51:18.605 --> 01:51:21.041
REALLY- WILL HAVE A VALUES

01:51:21.107 --> 01:51:22.509
QUESTION FOR THE SUB COMMITTEE

01:51:22.575 --> 01:51:24.544
AND HOW IT FITS INTO THE BROADER

01:51:24.611 --> 01:51:27.881
SENATE BUDGET- OUR PORTFOLIO AND

01:51:27.947 --> 01:51:30.083
PLAN. YEAH OKAY. THANK YOU VERY

01:51:30.150 --> 01:51:34.521
MUCH WORSE YES SENATE COURTESY.

01:51:34.587 --> 01:51:35.855
YEAH THEN I APPRECIATE THE

01:51:35.922 --> 01:51:38.925
EXPLANATION ON THE DIFFERENCE IN

01:51:38.992 --> 01:51:42.095
ADMINISTRATION AND IT IT DOES-

01:51:42.162 --> 01:51:45.098
NO OCCURRED TO ME THAT. JUST

01:51:45.165 --> 01:51:46.666
BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE

01:51:46.733 --> 01:51:50.203
RELIEF ON PAID SICK LEAVE- THAT

01:51:50.270 --> 01:51:52.138
THE ONLY EMPLOYER WOULD WOULD

01:51:52.205 --> 01:51:54.741
REALLY KNOW AND BE ABLE TO

01:51:54.808 --> 01:51:56.509
CERTIFY- YOU KNOW WHAT THEIR OUT

01:51:56.576 --> 01:51:59.079
OF POCKET ON HOW MANY EMPLOYEES

01:51:59.145 --> 01:52:01.181
HAVE ACTUALLY. IF YOU WILL STEP

01:52:01.247 --> 01:52:03.049
FORWARD AND CLAIM THAT KIND OF

01:52:03.116 --> 01:52:07.887
RELIEF- SO IT'S- YOU KNOW

01:52:07.954 --> 01:52:10.090
OBVIOUSLY SOME OF THE SAFEGUARDS

01:52:10.156 --> 01:52:10.723
IN IMPLEMENTATION THE

01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:11.491
ADMINISTRATOR GOING TO HAVE TO

01:52:11.558 --> 01:52:14.160
MAKE SURE THAT- YOU KNOW ALL

01:52:14.227 --> 01:52:16.463
THAT'S DONE- WITH USUAL SAVE

01:52:16.529 --> 01:52:17.897
CARS IN A PENALTY OF PERJURY

01:52:17.964 --> 01:52:19.833

AND EVERYTHING ELSE BUT- BUT IT

01:52:21.968 --> 01:52:24.104
IT IT WOULD BE PRETTY IMPOSSIBLE

01:52:24.170 --> 01:52:25.271
FOR THE EMPLOYER. FOR THE STATE

01:52:25.338 --> 01:52:27.841
TO KNOW. YOU KNOW WITHOUT SOME

01:52:27.907 --> 01:52:28.741
KIND OF A SURVEY OR SOMETHING

WHO. EVEN YOU KNOW WHAT. THE

01:52:32.078 --> 01:52:33.179
MAGNITUDE OF THESE CLAIMS ARE

01:52:33.246 --> 01:52:34.581
GOING TO BE OVERALL UNTIL THEY

01:52:34.647 --> 01:52:36.549
START COMING IN SO LIKE I GET IT

01:52:36.616 --> 01:52:38.852

01:52:38.918 --> 01:52:41.387
ATTRACTIVE AS- AS YOU KNOW SORT

01:52:41.454 --> 01:52:44.124

COME UP WITH A BETTER. BUT A WAY

01:52:49.262 --> 01:52:51.798
OF DOING THAT- AS WE SEE HERE

01:52:51.865 --> 01:52:54.267
TODAY. I DO SUPPORT BOTH ITEMS I

01:52:54.334 --> 01:52:56.269
SUPPORT EVERYTHING IN THIS ITEM-

01:52:56.336 --> 01:52:57.437
YOU KNOW HOW 2% YOU KNOW IN

01:52:57.504 --> 01:52:59.973

01:53:02.542 --> 01:53:05.278
I KNOW OF. SEVERAL BUSES IT

01:53:05.345 --> 01:53:06.646
PROBABLY ACTUALLY THE SAME

01:53:06.713 --> 01:53:09.983
COHORT APPEAR ON THIS PANEL BEEN

01:53:10.049 --> 01:53:11.251
PRETTY VOCAL ABOUT. MAKING SURE

01:53:11.317 --> 01:53:13.586
THAT THERE'S RELIEF- FOR THE

01:53:13.653 --> 01:53:15.822
SMALL BUSINESSES IT LEAST AS

01:53:15.889 --> 01:53:18.124
DEFINED HERE- BUT WE'VE HEARD A

01:53:18.191 --> 01:53:20.593
LOT ABOUT THE HARDSHIP ALREADY

01:53:20.660 --> 01:53:22.729

01:53:22.795 --> 01:53:23.196
OUT THERE N TERMS OF

01:53:23.263 --> 01:53:24.764
REIMBURSEMENTS NEEDED IT'S

01:53:24.831 --> 01:53:26.266

COURSE IF THAT'S- NOT RELIEVED

01:53:38.344 --> 01:53:40.513
SOMEHOW- YOU RISK OF SOME SORT

01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:42.649
OF YOU KNOW INSOLVENCY OR

01:53:42.715 --> 01:53:43.550
LAYOFFS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT

01:53:43.616 --> 01:53:45.485
WHICH IN TURN- GOES BACK IT

01:53:45.552 --> 01:53:47.587
HURTS THE EMPLOYEES THEMSELVES-

01:53:47.654 --> 01:53:49.789
KIND OF DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF

01:53:49.856 --> 01:53:51.324
THE PAID SICK LEAVE IN THE FIRST

01:53:51.391 --> 01:53:53.626

NOT THE RECRUITMENT IS BECOMING

02:12:54.933 --> 02:12:56.668
MORE DIVERSE WITHIN OUR PEOPLE

WHO COME IN THROUGH THAT

02:12:58.737 --> 02:13:01.306
EXPANDED THE FIRST RECRUITMENT

02:13:01.373 --> 02:13:03.041
