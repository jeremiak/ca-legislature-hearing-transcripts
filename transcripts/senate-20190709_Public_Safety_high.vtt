00:14:09.081 --> 00:14:10.849
FOR THAT MAILBOX AND OBVIOUSLY I

00:14:10.916 --> 00:14:14.787
THINK AS WE ALL KNOW -- MOST OF

00:14:14.853 --> 00:14:18.023
THAT DISARMING OF INDIVIDUALS IN

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:19.058
APPS HAS BEEN BY DONE AND DONE

00:14:19.124 --> 00:14:20.459
BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT

00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:21.493
JUSTICE.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:24.163
SO DID NOT HAPPEN AS PLANNED THE

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:24.630
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:26.632
INVOLVEMENT MEANWHILE IN THESE

00:14:26.699 --> 00:14:29.068
YEARS -- WE'VE ADDED TO THE APPS

00:14:29.134 --> 00:14:30.135
BACK LOAD.

00:14:30.202 --> 00:14:32.972
OUR STATE NOW RETAINS RECORDS OF

00:14:33.038 --> 00:14:34.173
WHO HAS PURCHASE LONG GUN.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.574
MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE MAY FALL ON

00:14:35.641 --> 00:14:37.676
THE APPS WE HAVE RECORDS NOW FOO

00:14:37.743 --> 00:14:40.012
HAS REGISTERED THERE ARE SO

00:14:40.079 --> 00:14:40.879
CALLED FULL OF BUTTON ASSAULT

00:14:40.946 --> 00:14:42.748
WEAPON OR THE GHOST GUN THE GUN

THAT THEY MANUFACTURED AND

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:44.850
ASSEMBLED.

00:14:44.917 --> 00:14:46.919
THE END GUN SALES WERE VERY HIGH

00:14:46.986 --> 00:14:48.754
VERTICALLY BETWEEN THE YEARS OF

00:14:48.821 --> 00:14:50.389
WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA SELECTED

00:14:50.456 --> 00:14:52.791
AND PRESIDENT TRUMP -- SO

00:14:52.858 --> 00:14:55.027
OBVIOUSLY THE WORKLOAD HAS

00:14:55.094 --> 00:14:56.962
INCREASED OUR TO DISARM PEOPLE

00:14:57.029 --> 00:14:58.764
IN APPS THE NUMBER KEEPS RISING

00:14:58.831 --> 00:15:00.499
IT'S BEEN A GREAT FRUSTRATION I

00:15:00.566 --> 00:15:02.167
KNOW TO MANY OF YOU -- AND

00:15:02.234 --> 00:15:04.169

00:15:04.236 --> 00:15:06.105

00:15:06.171 --> 00:15:08.173
RECENT SB ONE FORTY REPORT

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.441
SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT

00:15:09.508 --> 00:15:10.442
JUSTICE IS THAT LOCAL LAW

00:15:10.509 --> 00:15:13.612
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ONCE AGAIN --

00:15:13.679 --> 00:15:15.781
HELP WITH DISARMING PEOPLE WHO

00:15:17.116 --> 00:15:19.318
JURISDICTION -- IN DOING A PILOT

00:15:19.385 --> 00:15:21.020
PROGRAM IN THESE FOUR COUNTIES I

00:15:21.086 --> 00:15:22.788
THINK IS A GOOD WAY TO GO TO SEE

00:15:22.855 --> 00:15:24.690
HOW THIS WORKS TO LEARN FROM IT

00:15:24.757 --> 00:15:25.658
ESTABLISH.

00:15:25.724 --> 00:15:27.660

FOR OTHER LOCAL JURISDICTIONS --

00:15:29.561 --> 00:15:31.096
SO I THINK THIS IS A GOOD

00:15:31.163 --> 00:15:33.799
APPROACH FOR BRINGING DOWN THAT

00:15:33.866 --> 00:15:33.999
APP.

00:15:34.066 --> 00:15:35.634

JURISDICTIONS IN THE STATE.

00:15:42.708 --> 00:15:44.510
SO WE DRIVE OUT.

00:15:44.576 --> 00:15:45.944

MANAGE I KNOW THAT.

OUR HIGHWAY PATROL AND MANY

00:19:57.763 --> 00:19:59.831
OTHER AGENCIES ARE VERY EAGER

00:19:59.898 --> 00:20:01.934
FOR US TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.672
WE HAVE A VALID -- CAST AT THE

00:20:06.738 --> 00:20:09.508
POINT OF ARE ANY OFFICER.

00:20:09.575 --> 00:20:11.877
PULLING OVER SOMEONE WHO IS --

00:20:11.944 --> 00:20:13.679
DRIVING THEN THEY FEEL IMPAIRED.

00:20:13.745 --> 00:20:15.314
SO THAT WE CAN HAVE SOME

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:16.748
DETERMINATION.

00:20:16.815 --> 00:20:18.784
OF IF THEY'RE UNDER THE

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:19.751
INFLUENCE AND IF AND WHAT

00:20:19.818 --> 00:20:21.420
THEY'RE UNDER THE INFLUENCE.

00:20:21.486 --> 00:20:24.289
THE DIFFICULTY WITH CANNABIS IS

00:20:24.356 --> 00:20:25.791
THAT T. H. C. WILL STAND

00:20:25.857 --> 00:20:27.926
SOMEONE'S BLOOD SYSTEM. FOR A

00:20:27.993 --> 00:20:29.661
GOOD PERIOD OF TIME SO THEY

00:20:29.728 --> 00:20:31.730
COULD HAVE A UTILIZED CANNABIS A

00:20:31.797 --> 00:20:34.866
DAY EARLIER TWO DAYS EARLIER --

00:20:34.933 --> 00:20:36.001
AND BE.

00:20:36.068 --> 00:20:37.436
PERHAPS BE IMPAIRED FOR ANOTHER

00:20:37.502 --> 00:20:41.173
REASON AND YET IT MIGHT SHOW

00:20:41.239 --> 00:20:42.541
CANNABIS WITH OUR CURRENT

00:20:42.608 --> 00:20:45.344
TESTING SO I THINK THAT THE

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:46.678
AMENDMENT YOU'VE TAKEN IS VERY

00:20:46.745 --> 00:20:48.413
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT WILL GIVE

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.916
US MORE ACCURATE INFORMATION

00:20:50.983 --> 00:20:52.517
BECAUSE WE REALLY WANT TO KNOW.

00:20:52.584 --> 00:20:54.953
WHETHER THAT IMPAIRMENT IS

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:56.655
SOLELY CANNABIS ARE PRIMARILY

00:20:56.722 --> 00:20:58.390
CANNABIS OR IN A DIFFERENT DRUG

00:20:58.457 --> 00:21:00.125
SO THAT GIVES US THE INFORMATION

00:21:00.192 --> 00:21:03.161
AS TO WHETHER OUR THE NOT OUR

00:21:03.228 --> 00:21:06.264
BUT THE FACT OF LEGALIZATION.

00:21:06.331 --> 00:21:09.401
IF IT IS CONTRIBUTING TO MORE --

00:21:09.468 --> 00:21:11.570
IMPAIR DRIVING INCIDENTS --

00:21:11.637 --> 00:21:13.839
CERTAINLY OTHER STATES DATA

00:21:13.905 --> 00:21:15.674
WOULD INDICATE THAT IS SO AND I

00:21:15.741 --> 00:21:18.043
THINK THAT'S WHY YOUR MOTIVATION

00:24:46.852 --> 00:24:47.419
SIGNIFICANT MOMENTS WE'VE TAKEN

IMPACT OF THREE TOWING GROUNDS

00:25:03.535 --> 00:25:05.036
REFER TO AS PARTY TO US.

00:25:05.103 --> 00:25:06.404
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE

00:25:06.471 --> 00:25:08.039
ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR FIVE

00:25:08.106 --> 00:25:09.841
PARKING TICKETS AND OUTDATED CAR

00:25:09.908 --> 00:25:12.310
REGISTRATION FOR A PRIVATE

00:25:12.377 --> 00:25:14.379
PARKING SPOT -- SINCE OVER

00:25:14.446 --> 00:25:15.814
ALMOST HALF OF ALL CALIFORNIANS

00:25:15.881 --> 00:25:17.649
DON'T HAVE A SPARE FOUR HUNDRED

00:25:17.716 --> 00:25:18.917
DOLLARS FAR LESS THAN THE

00:25:18.984 --> 00:25:20.452
AVERAGE COST TO GET YOUR CAR OUT

00:25:20.518 --> 00:25:21.353
OF A TOW YARD.

00:25:21.419 --> 00:25:22.687
GETTING TOWED EQUALS ASSET

00:25:22.754 --> 00:25:25.290
FORFEITURE YOU LOSE YOUR CAR

00:25:25.357 --> 00:25:26.758
YOUR ABILITY TO GET YOUR JOB.

00:25:26.825 --> 00:25:28.493
MANY INSTANCES YOUR JOB YOU'RE

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.562
ONLY ECONOMIC ASSET FOR YOUR

00:25:30.629 --> 00:25:32.163
ONLY FORM OF SHELTER.

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:34.165
THESE TOES HAVE ACCELERATED

00:25:34.232 --> 00:25:35.834
POVERTY AND HOMELESSNESS.

00:25:35.901 --> 00:25:36.902
IT TURNS OUT THE TO YOUR ALSO

00:25:36.968 --> 00:25:38.003
LOSE MONEY ON THESE PROVISIONS

00:25:38.069 --> 00:25:40.238
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO STORE CARS

00:25:40.305 --> 00:25:41.640
BEFORE AUCTION SALES.

00:25:41.706 --> 00:25:43.475
AND THE AVERAGE STORAGE IN THE

00:25:43.541 --> 00:25:45.610
IN AN AUCTION SO CASA FAR EXCEED

00:25:45.677 --> 00:25:47.412
THE AVERAGE SALES PRICE OF A CAR.

00:25:47.479 --> 00:25:48.613
FOR SIMILAR REASONS CITIES

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:54.853
RUNNING THESE TOWING PROGRAMS

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.354
ALSO LOSE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

00:25:56.421 --> 00:25:56.922
THIS IS WHY WE ORIGINALLY

00:25:56.988 --> 00:25:57.622
PROPOSED ELIMINATING THESE

00:25:57.689 --> 00:25:58.356
PROVISIONS TO END A CYCLE OF

00:25:58.423 --> 00:25:59.858
POVERTY NOT WORKING FOR WORKING

00:25:59.925 --> 00:26:02.294
FAMILIES TôI YARDS OR CITIES.

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:02.928
NOW I WANT TO JUST TAKE A MOMENT

00:26:02.994 --> 00:26:03.595
TO TALK ABOUT WHAT OUR BILL DOES

00:26:03.662 --> 00:26:05.096
NOT DO BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A

00:26:05.163 --> 00:26:06.431
LOT OF MISINFORMATION ABOUT IT.

00:26:06.498 --> 00:26:07.732
FIRST THERE BEEN SOME ADVOCATES

00:26:07.799 --> 00:26:09.134
FOR CITIES TO SUGGEST THAT THIS

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.770
BILL AND STOWING THAT IS FALSE

00:26:11.836 --> 00:26:12.771
THRE ARE OVER THIRTY GROUNDS TO

00:26:12.837 --> 00:26:14.806
TOW CARS UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW.

00:26:14.873 --> 00:26:16.374
MOST HAVE TO DO WITH PUBLIC

00:26:16.441 --> 00:26:18.743
SAFETY AND TRAFFIC FLOW WE'RE

00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:20.078
NOT TOUCHING ANY OF THOSE.

00:26:20.145 --> 00:26:21.112
SECOND SOME CITIES HAVE SAID

00:26:21.179 --> 00:26:22.714
WILL ALLOW ABANDONED CARS ON THE

00:26:22.781 --> 00:26:24.249
STREETS THAT IS ALSO FALSE

00:26:24.316 --> 00:26:25.183
THERE'S A SPECIFIC TOWING

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:26.484
PROVISION THAT ALLOWS CITIES TO

00:26:26.551 --> 00:26:28.053
TOW CARS THAT ARE BANNED IN

00:26:28.119 --> 00:26:30.021
WRECKED OR INOPERATIVE.

00:26:30.088 --> 00:26:31.690
WE'RE NOT TOUCHING THAT.

00:26:31.756 --> 00:26:32.424
THIS COMMITTEE MAY HAVE ALSO

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:33.792
HEARD THE SUGGESTION THAT WERE

00:26:33.858 --> 00:26:35.493
SOMEHOW REMOVING LOCAL CONTROL

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:37.529
AND THAT IS ALSO FALSE THERE IS

00:26:37.595 --> 00:26:38.964
YET ANOTHER TIME PROVISION.

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:41.066
THAT WE'RE NOT TOUCHING WITH

00:26:41.132 --> 00:26:42.334
THIS BILL THAT ALLOWS THE CITY

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.735
TO PASS LOCAL TOWING LAWS TO

00:26:43.802 --> 00:26:45.036
ADDRESS LOCAL CIRCUMSTANCES.

00:26:45.103 --> 00:26:46.972
THIS IS A BILL THAT SUPPORTS

00:26:47.038 --> 00:26:48.406
PURE LOCAL CONTROL.

00:26:48.473 --> 00:26:49.274
NOW JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO

00:26:49.341 --> 00:26:50.608
DISCUSS THE SIGNIFICANT MOMENTS

00:26:50.675 --> 00:26:52.410
WE TOOK THE ORIGINAL BILL VOTED

00:26:52.477 --> 00:26:53.745
ON BY THE ASSEMBLY WOULD HAVE

00:26:53.812 --> 00:26:55.547
DELETED THE THREE POVERTY TOWING

00:26:55.613 --> 00:26:57.015
GROUNDS UNDER STATE LAW.

00:26:57.082 --> 00:26:58.450
AFTER NUMEROUS DISCUSSIONS WITH

00:26:58.516 --> 00:26:59.985
THIS COMMITTEE AND THE PREVIOUS

00:27:00.051 --> 00:27:01.987
COMMITTEE WE AMENDED OUR BILL TO

00:27:02.053 --> 00:27:03.722
ONLY DELETE ONE OF THE THREE

00:27:03.788 --> 00:27:04.823
TELLING GROUNDS.

00:27:04.889 --> 00:27:06.624
THE AMENDED VERSION OF THIS BILL

00:27:06.691 --> 00:27:08.693
WILL ALLOW CITIES TO CONTINUE TO

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.228
TOW FOR EXPIRED REGISTRATIONS.

00:27:10.295 --> 00:27:11.496
THE AMENDED VERSION OF THIS BILL

00:27:11.563 --> 00:27:13.098
WILL ALSO ALLOW CITIES TO

00:27:13.164 --> 00:27:14.632
CONTINUE -- TO TO CARS THAT HAVE

00:27:14.699 --> 00:27:16.301
BEEN LEGALLY PARKED ON PUBLIC

00:27:16.368 --> 00:27:16.835
STREETS.

00:27:16.901 --> 00:27:18.670
CURRENT LAW SAYS CARS CAN BE

00:27:18.737 --> 00:27:20.138
TOWED AFTER SEVENTY TWO HOURS

00:27:20.205 --> 00:27:21.473
WITHOUT NOTICE.

00:27:21.539 --> 00:27:23.041
SINCE MANY CITIES TOLD US THAT

00:27:23.108 --> 00:27:24.409
THEY DON'T TELL UNDER THIS OFFER

00:27:24.476 --> 00:27:26.044
AT LEAST A WEEK OR LONGER.

00:27:26.111 --> 00:27:27.879
AND SUPPORT PROVIDING NOTICE TO

00:27:27.946 --> 00:27:29.781
CAR OWNERS ARMAMENTS WOULD ALLOW

00:27:29.848 --> 00:27:31.316
A CAR TO BE TOWED IMMEDIATELY

00:27:31.383 --> 00:27:33.385
AFTER A NOTICE AND FIVE BUSINESS

00:27:33.451 --> 00:27:34.919
DAYS.

00:27:34.986 --> 00:27:36.187
OR BILL DOES MOVE TO AND TOWING

00:27:36.254 --> 00:27:37.422
FOR UNPAID PARKING TICKETS WHICH

00:27:37.489 --> 00:27:39.624
IS THE PUREST VERSION OF TELLING

00:27:39.691 --> 00:27:41.393
SOMEONE TO COLLECT A MINOR DEBT.

00:27:41.459 --> 00:27:42.727
I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT OUR BILL

00:27:42.794 --> 00:27:44.529
DOES NOT MAKE IT LEGAL TO NOT

00:27:44.596 --> 00:27:45.730
PAY PARKING TICKETS.

00:27:45.797 --> 00:27:47.565
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN CONTINUE

00:27:47.632 --> 00:27:49.334
TO LOSE USED AT LEAST EIGHT

00:27:49.401 --> 00:27:54.072
OTHER ALTERNATIVE REMEDIES TO

00:27:54.139 --> 00:27:55.974
COLLECT UNPAID DEBTS.

00:27:56.041 --> 00:27:56.775
LESSON ONE A NOTE FOR THIS

00:27:56.841 --> 00:27:57.776
COMMITTEE THAT THERE ARE STRONG

00:27:57.842 --> 00:27:58.910
CONSTITUTION ARGUMENTS THAT

00:27:58.977 --> 00:27:59.511
TELLING SOMEONE TO CLICK TO

00:27:59.577 --> 00:28:00.245
MINOR DEBT VIOLATES THE FOURTH

00:28:00.311 --> 00:28:01.746
AMENDMENT'S PROHIBITION.

00:28:01.813 --> 00:28:03.415
AGAINST SEIZURES OF PROPERTY THE

00:28:03.481 --> 00:28:04.783
EIGHTH AMENDMENT'S PROHIBITION

00:28:04.849 --> 00:28:06.084
AGAINST EXCESSIVE FINES.

00:28:06.151 --> 00:28:07.385
AND THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT'S

00:28:07.452 --> 00:28:09.020
PROHIBITIONS AGAINST DEPRIVING

00:28:09.087 --> 00:28:11.222
DUE PROCESS AND EQUAL PROTECTION

00:28:11.289 --> 00:28:13.224
WITH UP WANT TO TURN IT OVER TO

00:28:13.291 --> 00:28:14.259
A WITNESSES.

00:28:14.325 --> 00:28:16.327
YOU MAY PROCEED.

00:28:16.394 --> 00:28:18.430
I AM GRAHAM ACLU OF CALIFORNIA

00:28:18.496 --> 00:28:19.898
AS A PROUD CO SPONSOR OF THIS

00:28:19.964 --> 00:28:21.032
BILL.

00:28:21.099 --> 00:28:22.300
AS THE REPORT HIGHLIGHTS

00:28:22.367 --> 00:28:24.536
THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS LOSE

00:28:24.602 --> 00:28:26.471
THEIR CARS EVERY YEAR AS A

00:28:26.538 --> 00:28:28.506
RESULT OF POVERTY TOES THIS IS

00:28:28.573 --> 00:28:30.175
THEIR LIFELINE TO TRAVEL TO WORK

00:28:30.241 --> 00:28:32.744
GET TO SCHOOL OBTAIN HOUSING

00:28:32.811 --> 00:28:34.145
TAKE THEIR FAMILY TO THE DOCTOR.

00:28:34.212 --> 00:28:35.847
WHEN CARS GET TOWED FOR UNPAID

00:28:35.914 --> 00:28:37.082
PARKING TICKETS A COSTS

00:28:37.148 --> 00:28:38.983
INITIALLY HUNDREDS TO GET YOUR

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:40.018
CAR THE TO A LOT?

00:28:40.085 --> 00:28:42.153
AND THOUSANDS OFTEN BECAUSE LOW

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:44.656
INCOME FOLKS NEED TIME TO GATHER

00:28:44.722 --> 00:28:47.025
THAT INITIAL MONEY BUT EVERY DAY

00:28:47.092 --> 00:28:48.626
THAT THEY SPEND TRYING TO

00:28:48.693 --> 00:28:49.861
COLLECT THOSE FUNDS ADDITIONAL

00:28:49.928 --> 00:28:51.663
STORAGE FEES GET TACKED ON TO

00:28:51.729 --> 00:28:53.031
THEIR FINAL BILL.

00:28:53.098 --> 00:28:55.767
AS A RESULT THE CARS OFTEN COST

00:28:55.834 --> 00:28:57.135
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO GET OUT

00:28:57.202 --> 00:28:58.570
OF THE TOTAL YARDS LOW INCOME

00:28:58.636 --> 00:29:00.171
FAMILIES CAN'T AFFORD THAT THEY

00:29:00.238 --> 00:29:01.840
FORFEIT THEIR CARS.

00:29:01.906 --> 00:29:03.875
AND A CYCLE THAT BENEFITS NO ONE

00:29:03.942 --> 00:29:06.511
ENSUES THE CARS GET SOLD BY THE

00:29:06.578 --> 00:29:07.779
TOW YARD SET A LIEN SALE.

00:29:07.846 --> 00:29:08.813
THE MONEY FOR THE PARKING TICKET

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.548
THAT NEVER GETS COLLECTED BY THE

00:29:10.615 --> 00:29:12.050
CITY AS THE TOW YARD TO KEEP THE

00:29:12.117 --> 00:29:13.151
LIEN SALE.

00:29:13.218 --> 00:29:14.853
SO THE INDIVIDUALS OUT A

00:29:14.919 --> 00:29:17.155
LIFELINE FOR ECONOMIC

00:29:17.222 --> 00:29:19.524
OPPORTUNITY AND THE ORIGINAL

00:29:19.591 --> 00:29:22.594
PARKING TICKET THAT GOES ON PAID.

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:23.628
AND CARS WITH UNPAID PARKING

00:29:23.695 --> 00:29:25.130
TICKETS DON'T POSE A PUBLIC

00:29:25.196 --> 00:29:26.564
SAFETY THREAT THEY DON'T IMPEDE

00:29:26.631 --> 00:29:28.600
TRAFFIC LOW BUT THEY ARE

00:29:28.666 --> 00:29:30.101
UNFORTUNATELY EXTREMELY

00:29:30.168 --> 00:29:31.903
ESSENTIAL TO DAILY LIFE IN

00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:33.271
CALIFORNIA.

00:29:33.338 --> 00:29:34.572
THAT'S WHY WE BROUGHT THIS BILL

CAR. FOR THEIR LIVELIHOODS AND

00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:21.392
WERE ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT WAS

00:44:21.458 --> 00:44:22.526
TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM AND FOR

MANY OF THEM IT WAS FOR EXACTLY

00:44:26.897 --> 00:44:28.899
THE IT WAS EITHER A UNPAID

00:44:28.966 --> 00:44:30.701

00:44:30.768 --> 00:44:33.237
TICKET AND AS WE KNOW FOR

00:44:33.303 --> 00:44:35.639
EXAMPLE REGISTRATION UNLIKE MOST

00:44:35.706 --> 00:44:37.975
OTHER LARGE PAYMENTS THAT WE

00:44:38.042 --> 00:44:39.877
HAVE TO MAKE THAT WE COULD DO IN

00:44:39.943 --> 00:44:41.078
INSTALLMENTS.

00:44:41.145 --> 00:44:42.713

IN CALIFORNIA SO FINDING THAT --

00:44:47.718 --> 00:44:49.586
INITIAL THAT. FOR A LOT OF

00:44:49.653 --> 00:44:51.188
PEOPLE THAT BIG CHUNK OF MONEY

00:44:51.255 --> 00:44:53.290
WHETHER IT'S THREE HUNDRED BUCKS

00:44:53.357 --> 00:44:54.725
FIVE HUNDRED BUCKS WHATEVER THAT.

00:44:54.792 --> 00:44:56.427
IS VERY DIFFICULT SO SOMETIMES

00:44:56.493 --> 00:44:57.895
IT GETS DELAYED.

00:44:57.961 --> 00:44:59.930

00:44:59.997 --> 00:45:01.732

LIMITS BUT THAT'S OKAY IT WENT

00:45:10.741 --> 00:45:12.576
THROUGH TO COMMITTEES -- SO I

00:45:12.643 --> 00:45:14.411
MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LITTLE MORE --

00:45:14.478 --> 00:45:16.146
APART ALLOWED A FEW MORE OF YOUR

00:45:16.213 --> 00:45:18.282

EXPERIENCES HERE WHAT I WOULD

00:45:41.839 --> 00:45:42.339
SAY IS.

00:45:42.406 --> 00:45:43.507
OUR EXPERIENCES ARE VERY

00:45:43.574 --> 00:45:44.975
DIFFERENT FROM THE EXPERIENCES

00:45:45.042 --> 00:45:46.977
OF MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO

00:45:47.044 --> 00:45:49.413
DON'T HAVE FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:50.013
TO GET THE CAR BUT TO YARD IN

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:51.482
THE SITUATION THAT WE JUST

00:45:51.548 --> 00:45:52.683
DESCRIBED FAR MORE THAN THAT.

00:45:52.749 --> 00:45:55.285
ON AVERAGE IT'S ABOUT ELEVEN

00:45:55.352 --> 00:45:55.819
HUNDRED TO TWELVE HUNDRED

00:45:55.886 --> 00:45:57.221
DOLLARS BY THE TIME YOU ADD FEES

00:45:57.287 --> 00:45:59.256
AND AND STORAGE FEES AND AND AND

00:45:59.323 --> 00:46:00.891
THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

00:46:00.958 --> 00:46:03.560
SOMEONE -- HAVING THE ASSET THAT

00:46:03.627 --> 00:46:05.429
THEY SPEND A LOT OF TIME TO TWO

00:46:05.496 --> 00:46:07.631
TO EARN OR LOSING THEIR THEIR

00:46:07.698 --> 00:46:09.700
CAR LOSING THEIR ABILITY TO GET

00:46:09.766 --> 00:46:11.668
TO WORK LOSING THEIR JOB.

00:46:11.735 --> 00:46:12.603
POTENTIALLY LOSING THEIR ONLY

00:46:12.669 --> 00:46:13.737
FROM A SHELTER -- WE THINK THIS

IS A VERY MODEST STEP TO ADDRESS

00:46:18.275 --> 00:46:18.842
AND WITH THAT RESPECT THE OSCARS

FEES ARE AS STATE FACILITIES

01:04:14.317 --> 01:04:15.151
OBVIOUSLY AND THEN THEY HAVE

01:04:15.218 --> 01:04:17.053
PRIVATE CONTRACTED FACILITIES AT

01:04:17.119 --> 01:04:18.087
THESE FOR POPULATION MANAGEMENT.

01:04:18.154 --> 01:04:19.922
IF YOU TAKE THAT OFF THE TABLE

01:04:19.989 --> 01:04:20.957
AS THIS BILL DOES BEEN CCR HAS

01:04:21.023 --> 01:04:21.824
LIMITED OPTIONS WHEN IT COMES TO

01:04:21.891 --> 01:04:23.125
HOUSING PEOPLE IN THAT HOUSING

01:04:23.192 --> 01:04:24.160
IN THE FACILITIES THAT CCR HAS

01:04:24.227 --> 01:04:25.628
PRISON FACILITIES -- OR WE

01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:27.530
EXPECT -- BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN

01:04:27.597 --> 01:04:28.631
ASKED THIS QUESTION HOW ANY OF

01:04:28.698 --> 01:04:30.366
THE COUNTY JAIL BEDS ARE THERE

01:04:30.433 --> 01:04:31.567
THAT THERE WILL BE A DRAW AN

01:04:31.634 --> 01:04:33.302
ATTEMPT TO DRAW ON COUNTY JAIL

01:04:33.369 --> 01:04:35.037
FACILITIES AND THAT'S WHAT WERE

01:04:35.104 --> 01:04:36.172
CONCERNED ABOUT IN THIS REGARD

01:04:36.239 --> 01:04:36.739
SO.

01:04:36.806 --> 01:04:38.241
THAT THE PRIVATE FACILITIES ARE

01:04:38.307 --> 01:04:41.043
NOT TAKING JAIL CAPACITY -- IT'S

01:04:41.110 --> 01:04:42.645
JUST AGAIN IT'S ONE IT'S ONE

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:44.447
THING THAT THE STATE HAS ON THE

01:04:44.513 --> 01:04:46.115
TABLE AND AND THAT'S OUR CONCERN

01:04:46.182 --> 01:04:48.117
IS THE SORT OF TRICKLE DOWN IF

01:04:48.184 --> 01:04:49.185
YOU WILL ON HOW THAT COULD

01:04:49.252 --> 01:04:51.487
IMPACT COUNTY JAIL FACILITIES.

01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:53.356
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IT COSTS TO

01:04:53.422 --> 01:04:56.559
HOUSE AN INDIVIDUAL WITH CDC ARE

01:04:56.626 --> 01:04:57.460
FOR A YEAR.

01:04:57.526 --> 01:04:59.161
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE IF

01:04:59.228 --> 01:05:00.630
YOU JUST DIVIDE THE TOTAL BUDGET

01:05:00.696 --> 01:05:01.797
OF CITIES ARE BY THE NUMBER OF

01:05:01.864 --> 01:05:03.266
INMATES THAT OUR HOUSE THAT IS

01:05:03.332 --> 01:05:04.467
AROUND EIGHTY THREE THOUSAND

01:05:04.533 --> 01:05:04.734
DOLLARS.

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:05.801
BUT MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE

01:05:05.868 --> 01:05:06.969
MARGINAL RATE THE ACTUAL

01:05:07.036 --> 01:05:09.238
DIFFERENCE FROM RELEASING ONE

01:05:09.305 --> 01:05:10.172
PERSON BECAUSE YOU STILL HAVE

01:05:10.239 --> 01:05:11.474
ALL OF THE OVERHEAD IN THE YOU

01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:12.475
DON'T LOSE THE ECONOMIES OF

01:05:12.541 --> 01:05:14.677
SCALE BUT IT'S ABOUT TWELVE

01:05:14.744 --> 01:05:15.278
THOUSAND DOLLARS THE MARGINAL

01:05:15.344 --> 01:05:16.646
RATE.

01:05:16.712 --> 01:05:18.547
THEN WHAT IS IT COSTING TO USE A

01:05:18.614 --> 01:05:18.981
PRIVATE.

01:05:19.048 --> 01:05:22.818
FACILITY I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT

01:05:22.885 --> 01:05:24.420
RATE IS CERTAIN.

01:05:24.487 --> 01:05:27.290
THEN -- I JUST WONDER IF MAYBE

01:05:27.356 --> 01:05:28.524
PROVIDE WILL BALANCE AT LEAST

01:05:28.591 --> 01:05:32.461
THE INDIVIDUAL FROM RIVERSIDE --

01:05:32.528 --> 01:05:32.995
MENTION THAT THEY WEREN'T

01:05:33.062 --> 01:05:33.629
PERFECT AND I WOULD JUST SAY AS

01:05:33.696 --> 01:05:36.032
A FORMER COUNTY SUPERVISOR

01:05:36.098 --> 01:05:37.667
HAVING HAD TO DEAL WITH THE

01:05:37.733 --> 01:05:39.468
JAILS.

01:05:39.535 --> 01:05:41.137
IN THE LAWSUIT.

01:05:41.203 --> 01:05:42.538
AND THE CULTURE -- I WOULD SAY

01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:43.939
THAT'S CORECT INSIDE I DON'T

01:05:44.006 --> 01:05:47.276
KNOW IF I CAN MAKE COMPARISON.

01:05:47.343 --> 01:05:48.611
TO A PRIVATE INSTITUTION VERSUS

01:05:48.678 --> 01:05:50.513
A PUBLIC INSTITUTION BUT THEY'RE

01:05:50.579 --> 01:05:52.048
BOTH.

01:05:52.114 --> 01:05:53.616
BOTH HAVE ISSUES I WOULD WANT TO

01:05:53.683 --> 01:05:54.717
SPEND A NIGHT EITHER.

01:05:54.784 --> 01:05:56.786
ONE SO -- BUT I'M I'M CONCERNED

01:05:56.852 --> 01:05:58.921
ABOUT BLOCKING A PRIVATE SECTOR

01:05:58.988 --> 01:06:00.656
OPPORTUNITY.

01:06:00.723 --> 01:06:02.258
SO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR.

A REASONED RESPONSE ONE IS IN IN

01:06:30.019 --> 01:06:32.722
MY HUMBLE OPINION AS A

01:06:32.788 --> 01:06:33.022
LEGISLATOR.

01:06:33.089 --> 01:06:34.123
I THINK THAT.

01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:34.757
SOME OPTIONS JUST SHOULD NOT BE

01:06:34.824 --> 01:06:36.192
ON THE TABLE WHEN THE LEVEL OF

01:06:36.258 --> 01:06:39.161
OF ABUSE AND MISTREATMENT IS AS

01:06:39.228 --> 01:06:41.464
HIGH AS IT IS -- I UNDERSTAND

01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:43.132
THAT -- IT'S SEEN AS AN OPTION

01:06:43.199 --> 01:06:45.401
BUT IT'S AN OPTION WHERE.

01:06:45.468 --> 01:06:46.802
NOT FOR PROFIT PRIVATE DETENTION

01:06:46.869 --> 01:06:47.436
FACILITIES I'M TALKING ABOUT IN

01:06:47.503 --> 01:06:50.906
PRISONS BUT IT'S AN OPTION WHERE --

01:06:50.973 --> 01:06:52.341
WE HAVE -- CHRONICALLY CHRONIC

01:06:52.408 --> 01:06:53.642
UNDER STAFFING.

01:06:53.709 --> 01:06:55.778
WHERE WE HAVE AN ADEQUATE

01:06:55.845 --> 01:06:57.313
TRAINING BUT WE HAVE INADEQUATE

01:06:57.380 --> 01:06:59.482
PAY -- WHERE WE HAVE LACK OF

01:06:59.548 --> 01:07:00.683
ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE AND

01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:02.118
INADEQUATE HEALTHCARE WE HAVE

01:07:02.184 --> 01:07:03.786
ASSAULTS OF INMATES ON OTHER

01:07:03.853 --> 01:07:04.854
INMATES IN INMATES ON STAFF?

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:08.023
AT MUCH HIGHER RATES -- SO I'VE

01:07:08.090 --> 01:07:09.058
SEEN STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT THAT

01:07:09.125 --> 01:07:11.026
THE FOR PROFIT PRIVATE DETENTION

01:07:11.093 --> 01:07:13.028
FACILITIES COST MORE.

01:07:13.095 --> 01:07:14.663
BUT EVEN IF THEY COST LESS.

01:07:14.730 --> 01:07:16.031
THE THE OUTCOMES FOR

01:07:16.098 --> 01:07:18.901
CALIFORNIANS IS UNACCEPTABLE AND

01:07:18.968 --> 01:07:20.236
THAT'S WHY I'M I'M PUSHING FOR

01:07:20.302 --> 01:07:21.804
OUR AT THE END OF THEIR USE.

01:07:21.871 --> 01:07:22.938
THAT WE SHOULD NOT SUBJECT

01:07:23.005 --> 01:07:25.074
CALIFORNIANS TO SUCH CONDITIONS --

01:07:25.141 --> 01:07:27.576
WHERE THEIR HEALTH AND WELFARE

01:07:27.643 --> 01:07:28.210
AND SAFETY IS PUT AT RISK EVERY

01:07:28.277 --> 01:07:28.711
DAY?

01:07:28.778 --> 01:07:31.380
WE HAVE A CHOICE AND WE CAN DO

01:07:31.447 --> 01:07:33.149
DIFFERENTLY -- WE DID ASK ABOUT

01:07:33.215 --> 01:07:35.351
THE CAPACITY FOR IN STATE COUNTY

01:07:35.418 --> 01:07:37.553
AND CITY JAIL BEDS -- WITH THE

01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:39.688
IDEA THAT IT SHOULD WE EVER NEED --

01:07:39.755 --> 01:07:40.689
COULD ADDITIONAL CAPACITY AND WE

01:07:40.756 --> 01:07:42.925
DON'T NOW AND WHAT WERE UNDER

01:07:42.992 --> 01:07:44.527
THE QUARTER CAP AND WIH THINGS

01:07:44.593 --> 01:07:46.095
I PROP 47-57.

01:07:46.162 --> 01:07:47.263
OUR NEED FOR BEDS IS EVER

01:07:47.329 --> 01:07:48.631
DECREASING BUT IF WE EVER NEEDED

01:07:48.697 --> 01:07:52.635
THEM WE COULD AT ARMS LENGTH --

01:07:52.701 --> 01:07:54.203
HAVE A CONTRACT WITH THAT AS A

01:07:54.270 --> 01:07:55.938
COUNTY JAIL POTENTIALLY IF THE

01:07:56.005 --> 01:07:57.139
COUNTY JAIL WANTED.

01:07:57.206 --> 01:07:57.907
AND THEY WERE THE PAY IN THE

01:07:57.973 --> 01:07:59.909
COMPENSATION FROM THE STATE WAS

01:07:59.975 --> 01:08:01.010
ADEQUATE THE SECURITY LEVELS

01:08:01.076 --> 01:08:03.045
RIGHT -- WE COULD PUT --

01:08:03.112 --> 01:08:04.280
CALIFORNIANS IN A PUBLIC

01:08:04.346 --> 01:08:05.414
FACILITY WHERE THERE'S OVERSIGHT

01:08:05.481 --> 01:08:06.549
AND TRANSPARENCY AND

01:08:06.615 --> 01:08:08.651
ACCOUNTABILITY AN APPROPRIATE

01:08:08.717 --> 01:08:10.519
TRAINING AN APPROPRIATE STAFFING --

01:08:10.586 --> 01:08:12.054
OF COURSE TO AS YOU HAVE

01:08:12.121 --> 01:08:13.923
MENTIONED THAT WE CAN DO BETTER

01:08:13.989 --> 01:08:14.790
AND ALL OF OUR FACILITIES

01:08:14.857 --> 01:08:16.592
INCLUDING OUR PUBLIC FACILITIES.

01:08:16.659 --> 01:08:17.927
BUT BOB BETTER TO HAVE A

01:08:17.993 --> 01:08:19.094
FACILITY WHERE YOU'RE NOT DRIVEN

01:08:19.161 --> 01:08:20.563
BY THE MIGHTY DOLLAR.

01:08:20.629 --> 01:08:22.798
I AND YOUR DRIVEN BY -- WHAT

01:08:22.865 --> 01:08:25.134
LEGISLATIVE POLICY IS AND THAT

01:08:25.201 --> 01:08:26.602
IS TO TO BE ABILITY --

01:08:26.669 --> 01:08:33.843
CALIFORNIANS PREPARE THEM FOR A

01:08:33.909 --> 01:08:36.412
BETTER FUTURE. FOR SEX FOR

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:37.079
SUCCESSFUL REENTRY -- THAT'S

01:08:37.146 --> 01:08:38.314
WHERE WE SHOULD BE SPENDING OUR

01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:40.149
DOLLARS -- SO I THINK THE TIME

01:08:40.216 --> 01:08:42.451
IS CALM I I I DO BELIEVE -- THAT

01:08:42.518 --> 01:08:43.385
THESE OF FOR PROFIT PRIVATE

01:08:43.452 --> 01:08:44.487
PRISONS AND DETENTION FACILITIES

01:08:44.553 --> 01:08:45.054
WAS WAS WRONG THEN AND IT'S

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:45.354
WRONG NOW.

01:08:45.421 --> 01:08:46.489
WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE

01:08:46.555 --> 01:08:47.356
THE COURSE OF WHERE WE'RE GOING --

01:14:54.456 --> 01:14:55.290
JUSTICE.

01:14:55.357 --> 01:14:57.926
HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY NOT

01:14:57.993 --> 01:14:59.795
ONLY THE APPS PROGRAM WHICH AS

01:14:59.862 --> 01:15:01.530
WE DISCUSSED BEFORE HAS BEEN A

01:15:01.597 --> 01:15:05.868
FRUSTRATION.AND A DEMAND ON GRAY ON FOR OF

01:15:05.934 --> 01:15:08.370
RESOURCES BUT ALSO THE NUMBER

01:15:08.437 --> 01:15:10.138
BACKGROUND CHECKS THAT HAVE TO

01:15:10.205 --> 01:15:11.139
OCCUR.

01:15:11.206 --> 01:15:13.141
MINOR TING GUN SHOWS -- GUN

01:15:13.208 --> 01:15:15.310
DEALERS EVERY TIME WE PASS A NEW

01:15:15.377 --> 01:15:17.746
LAW AND I'M PART OF THAT I'D MET --

01:15:17.813 --> 01:15:20.782
DOJ HAS TO DO THAT TECH UPGRADES

01:15:20.849 --> 01:15:22.417
AND CHANGE THEIR SYSTEMS SO

01:15:22.484 --> 01:15:24.653
IMPLEMENT NEW IMPLEMENTATIONS

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:27.689
COSTS -- THAN HIGH NUMBER OF GUN

01:15:27.756 --> 01:15:30.592
SALES COSTS OBVIOUSLY THERE IT'S

01:15:30.659 --> 01:15:32.427
IS THE IMPACT ON THE RP BUT A

01:15:32.494 --> 01:15:34.329
PERSON SYSTEM PROGRAM BUT ON THE

01:15:34.396 --> 01:15:35.731
OTHER ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES AND

01:15:35.797 --> 01:15:37.165
OF COURSE THE MOST IMPORTANT JOB

01:15:37.232 --> 01:15:38.600
IS TO IN THE BACKGROUND CHECK

01:15:38.667 --> 01:15:40.836
WHICH I HAD THOUGHT THE NINETEEN

01:15:40.903 --> 01:15:41.703
DOLLARS.

01:15:41.770 --> 01:15:43.839
COVERED IT DOES NOT A COST

01:15:43.906 --> 01:15:46.808
CONSIDERABLY MORE -- SO I THINK

01:15:46.875 --> 01:15:49.745
DOJ NEWS NEEDS THE RESOURCES TO

01:15:49.811 --> 01:15:51.713
THE JOB TO DO THE JOB THAT

01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:53.282
CERTAINLY MY ORGANIZATION

01:15:53.348 --> 01:15:54.950
EXPECTS THEM TO DO.

01:15:55.017 --> 01:15:58.687
BUT ALSO ON THAT AS LEGISLATORS

01:15:58.754 --> 01:16:00.956
AND LAWS THAT YOU'VE ENACTED --

01:16:01.023 --> 01:16:02.391
YOU EXPECT THOSE LAWS TO BE

01:16:02.457 --> 01:16:04.459
FULLY ENFORCED THIS IS WHERE WE

GUN SHOW PORTIONS ARE

01:17:23.839 --> 01:17:25.707
UNNECESSARY AS THE LAWS OF THE

GOING TO DRAMATICALLY.

01:17:39.321 --> 01:17:40.489
INCREASE AND IT'S A LITTLE BIT

01:17:40.555 --> 01:17:41.690
CONFUSING ON WHAT'S HAPPENING

01:17:41.757 --> 01:17:44.593
RIGHT NOW IF YOU LOOK AT THE THE

01:17:44.659 --> 01:17:47.162
FEES ARE PAID BY -- PEOPLE WHEN

01:17:47.229 --> 01:17:47.796
THEY GOING TO PURCHASE A FIREARM

01:17:47.863 --> 01:17:49.131
RIGHT NOW WHAT IS COMMONLY

01:17:49.197 --> 01:17:50.032
REFERRED TO AS THE DRUGS HE'S

01:17:50.098 --> 01:17:51.600
ACTUALLY MADE UP OF SEVERAL FEES

01:17:51.666 --> 01:17:53.568
AND SO YOU HAVE -- THE NINETEEN

01:17:53.635 --> 01:17:54.436
DOLLARS WHICH IS ACTUALLY DID

01:17:54.503 --> 01:17:55.904
EUROCITY WHICH IS ORIGINALLY

01:17:55.971 --> 01:17:57.439
INTENDED TO GO TOWARDS

01:17:57.506 --> 01:17:58.940
BACKGROUND CHECKS AND REGISTRIES.

01:17:59.007 --> 01:17:59.875
MANY OF A ONE DOLLAR FIREARM

01:17:59.941 --> 01:18:01.309
SAFETY ACT FEE AND A FIVE DOLLAR

01:18:01.376 --> 01:18:03.111
FIRE ARM SAFETY IN ENFORCEMENT

01:18:03.178 --> 01:18:05.881
THE AS WELL AS OTHER PHYSICAL

01:18:05.947 --> 01:18:07.349
CLING FSE SIX CETERA.

01:18:07.416 --> 01:18:09.184
I'M INTO WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.

01:18:09.251 --> 01:18:11.920
IS THAT NINETEEN DOLLAR FEE IS

01:18:11.987 --> 01:18:13.321
GETTING MOVED DOWN TO ONE DOLLAR.

01:18:13.388 --> 01:18:14.623
AND THEY'RE LIMITING THE

01:18:14.689 --> 01:18:17.292
APPLICATION OF THAT ONE DOLLAR

01:18:17.359 --> 01:18:18.293
FEE.

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:19.694
AND THEN THERE CREATING AN

01:18:19.761 --> 01:18:21.863
ENTIRELY NEW FEE -- WHICH WE

01:18:21.930 --> 01:18:23.365
FEEL IS A TAX BECAUSE OF THE

01:18:23.432 --> 01:18:26.068
BROAD APPLICATION IT CAN BE USED.

01:18:26.134 --> 01:18:27.002
FOR AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S

01:18:27.069 --> 01:18:29.404
HAPPENING IS -- TWENTY EIGHT TO

01:18:29.471 --> 01:18:30.772
THREE IS NOT EVEN BEING ADDRESS

01:18:30.839 --> 01:18:33.341
WHICH STILL SEEMS TO ALLOW TO BE.

01:18:33.408 --> 01:18:35.444
DONE DOT TO CHARGE FOURTEEN

01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:36.378
DOLLARS AND I I WOULD LIKE SOME.

01:18:36.445 --> 01:18:37.512
BIG THAT NEED TO BE A LITTLE BIT

01:18:37.579 --> 01:18:40.515
OF CLARIFICATION ON THAT BECAUSE

01:18:40.582 --> 01:18:41.116
RIGHT NOW A LOT OF THIS HINGES

01:18:41.183 --> 01:18:45.821
ON AND SO I THINK THAT THAT IT

01:18:45.887 --> 01:18:46.822
THAT SECTION NEEDS TO BE LOOKED

01:18:46.888 --> 01:18:47.289
AT WHETHER.

01:18:47.355 --> 01:18:48.623
THEY COULD STILL POTENTIALLY

01:18:48.690 --> 01:18:49.958
CHARGE.

01:18:50.025 --> 01:18:51.326
UNDER THAT NOW IF YOU LOOK AT

01:18:51.393 --> 01:18:53.061
THE HISTORY OF OF DROGO'S OVER

01:18:53.128 --> 01:18:56.198
THE COURSE OF TIME IT IT HAS

01:18:56.264 --> 01:18:57.732
INCREASED YES.

01:18:57.799 --> 01:19:00.135
AND IN FACT TO ROCES AMASSED A

01:19:00.202 --> 01:19:00.902
SURPLUS IN THE TENS OF MILLIONS

01:19:00.969 --> 01:19:03.405
OF DOLLARS NOT THAT LONG AGO --

01:19:03.472 --> 01:19:05.173
THIS FEE.

01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:06.174
BACK IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSAND

01:19:06.241 --> 01:19:06.775
WE'RE ABLE TO BORROW I THINK

01:19:06.842 --> 01:19:07.576
AROUND TWENTY FOUR MILLION

01:19:07.642 --> 01:19:08.977
DOLLARS TO GO TOWARDS OUR APPS

01:19:09.044 --> 01:19:09.945
PROGRAM.

01:19:10.011 --> 01:19:12.247
AND IF YOU LOOK AT GUN SALES VAN

01:19:12.314 --> 01:19:13.582
AS IS SO SEATED WITH NOW

01:19:13.648 --> 01:19:14.716
CONCEALS WERE ABOUT HALF OF WHAT

01:19:14.783 --> 01:19:15.917
THEY ARE TODAY.

01:19:15.984 --> 01:19:17.519
SO PRESUMABLY DOJ'S GETTING A

01:19:17.586 --> 01:19:19.521
WHOLE LOT MORE MONEY COMING IN

01:19:19.588 --> 01:19:20.789
IN FACT FOR THE LAST.

01:19:20.856 --> 01:19:22.491
UP TO SEVEN SEVEN YEARS OR SO

01:19:22.557 --> 01:19:25.160
CALIFORNIA'S BEEN DOING OVER A

01:19:25.227 --> 01:19:25.694
HUNDRED THOUSAND SURE FARM

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:27.863
TRANSACTIONS.

01:19:27.929 --> 01:19:29.598
SO IF WE WERE ABLE.

01:19:29.664 --> 01:19:31.600
TO A MASS THAT KIND OF SURPLUS

01:19:31.666 --> 01:19:32.734
WHEN FIREARM SALES WERE HALF OF

01:19:32.801 --> 01:19:33.768
WHAT THEY ARE PRESUMABLY THEY'RE

01:19:33.835 --> 01:19:35.737
TAKING IN ALL CLOSE TO TWICE AS

01:19:35.804 --> 01:19:37.572
MUCH MONEY.

01:19:37.639 --> 01:19:38.640
NOW GRANTED THE DOJ DOES HAVE

01:19:38.707 --> 01:19:40.308
MORE CONSTRAINTS ON THEM AND

01:19:40.375 --> 01:19:41.476
THAT IS SUBJECT SUBJECT TO

01:19:41.543 --> 01:19:44.779
LITIGATION WHICH WAS MENTIONED --

01:19:44.846 --> 01:19:46.281
THERE WAS CITY -- RULING THAT

01:19:46.348 --> 01:19:47.616
SAID IT WASN'T A TAXING GENTRY

01:19:47.682 --> 01:19:48.216
CASE IN THE LOWER COURTS BUT

01:19:48.283 --> 01:19:51.920
THAT IS ON APPEAL AND THURS

01:19:51.987 --> 01:19:52.554
THEY'RE THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE

01:19:52.621 --> 01:19:54.523
SINCLAIR PAIN CASES TO WHETHER

01:19:54.589 --> 01:19:56.424
THAT'S GOING.

01:19:56.491 --> 01:19:57.826
TO BE -- YEP HELD IN THE COURT

01:19:57.893 --> 01:19:58.126
OF APPEALS.

01:19:58.193 --> 01:20:00.061
BUT I THINK THAT BEFORE WE GO

01:20:00.128 --> 01:20:03.064
ABOUT AND INCREASING THIS THIS

01:20:03.131 --> 01:20:04.299
WEEK THIS FEATURE MANICALLY WE

01:20:04.366 --> 01:20:05.200
NEED TO ACTUALLY LOOK AND SEE

01:20:05.267 --> 01:20:06.034
WHAT WERE THOSE THAT MONEY'S

01:20:06.101 --> 01:20:06.535
GOING.

01:20:06.601 --> 01:20:07.869
THERE IS AN HONOR REQUEST A

01:20:07.936 --> 01:20:09.337
COUPLE YEARS AGO THAT WAS DENIED

01:20:09.404 --> 01:20:10.438
BECAUSE OF THAT PENDING

01:20:10.505 --> 01:20:11.873
LITIGATION BUT BEFORE WE GO AND

01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:12.440
WRITE THIS.

01:20:12.507 --> 01:20:14.109
THIS MASSIVE CHECK I THINK WE

01:20:14.176 --> 01:20:15.477
REALLY NEED TO EXAMINE WHERE

01:20:15.544 --> 01:20:16.912
THAT MONEY'S GOING.

01:20:16.978 --> 01:20:18.680
AND NOT CONTINUE TO PUT MORE AND

01:20:18.747 --> 01:20:21.550
MORE COST CONSTRAINTS ON GUN

01:20:21.616 --> 01:20:23.585
OWNERS -- TO FOR THE FUN OF

01:20:23.652 --> 01:20:28.023
FIREARMS DIVISION WITH WITH THIS

01:20:28.089 --> 01:20:29.991
BROAD CHARGING STATUTE.

01:20:30.058 --> 01:20:30.759
IT'S FOR THAT.

01:20:30.825 --> 01:20:32.194
AND MANY OTHER REASONS THAT WE

01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:33.628
ARE IN OPPOSITION TO A ALSO ONE

01:20:33.695 --> 01:20:34.996
OTHER NOTE -- I KNOW THAT.

01:20:35.063 --> 01:20:36.765
THERE WAS MENTION THAT CUT

01:20:36.831 --> 01:20:37.365
BACKGROUND CHECKS SALES HAVE

01:20:37.432 --> 01:20:39.768
GONE UP BUT WE'VE HEARD THAT --

01:20:39.834 --> 01:20:41.069
EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE MORE

01:20:41.136 --> 01:20:42.571
CHECKS TODAY IT'S LESS LABOR

01:20:42.637 --> 01:20:43.705
INTENSIVE BECAUSE WE BECOME

01:20:43.772 --> 01:20:45.607
INCREASINGLY MORE AUTOMATED WITH

01:20:45.674 --> 01:20:46.942
OUR RECORD SYSTEM IN THE SYSTEMS

01:20:47.008 --> 01:20:48.510
HAVE BEEN IMPROVED SO IT'S NOT

01:20:48.577 --> 01:20:49.678
NECESSARILY REQUIRING MORE

01:20:49.744 --> 01:20:54.683
PERSONNEL. TO DO MORE CHECKS SO

01:20:54.749 --> 01:20:56.985
WITH THAT THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS.

01:20:57.052 --> 01:20:57.852
THE MANAGER MEMBERS SAMPRAS

REPRESENTING GUN WAS CALIFORNIA

01:20:59.387 --> 01:20:59.955
JUST A COUPLE OF POINTS TO FOR

01:21:00.021 --> 01:21:00.455
THE CLERK FIVE WITH MY

01:21:00.522 --> 01:21:01.790
COLLEAGUES.

01:21:01.856 --> 01:21:04.192
HAS POINTED OUT ON THE THE

01:21:04.259 --> 01:21:05.093
AMMUNITION LAWS.

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:08.430
DO NOT EXEMPT ANYBODY -- WHETHER

01:21:08.496 --> 01:21:09.931

01:21:11.833 --> 01:21:13.702
INCLUDES EVERYBODY SO.

01:21:13.768 --> 01:21:15.470
THE ADDITION OF THE OF THE

01:21:15.537 --> 01:21:20.942
CLEANUP LANGUAGES IS NOT AS DIRE

01:21:21.009 --> 01:21:21.810
AS YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE ARE

01:21:21.876 --> 01:21:23.111
TRYING TO MAKE IT -- THAT THAT

01:21:23.178 --> 01:21:24.446
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT

01:21:24.512 --> 01:21:26.147
ALL AMMUNITION VENDORS AT ALL

01:21:26.214 --> 01:21:28.083
GUN SHOWS COMPLY WITH ALL OF THE

01:21:28.149 --> 01:21:30.785
AMMUNITION -- SELLING LAWS --

AND AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

01:21:33.822 --> 01:21:37.158
AND ALL OF THAT SO THAT THAT --

01:21:37.225 --> 01:21:37.792
KIND OF PUT THAT TO REST IN OUR

01:21:37.859 --> 01:21:38.059
OPINION.

01:21:38.126 --> 01:21:43.365
THE THE THE SWITCHING OF THE THE

01:21:43.431 --> 01:21:46.268
FUN FROM THE REGULAR DRAWS TO

01:21:46.334 --> 01:21:49.137
THIS NEW CHAPTER -- OR OR NEW

01:21:49.204 --> 01:21:53.308
NEW NEW SECTION -- IT CANNOT BE

01:21:53.375 --> 01:21:54.009
CONSIDERED AS ANYTHING OTHER

01:21:54.075 --> 01:21:55.710
THAN JUST THE ATTACKS I THINK

01:21:55.777 --> 01:21:57.646
THAT THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS ADD.

01:21:57.712 --> 01:22:00.448
UP AND DOWN THE ROAD SO FAR --

01:22:00.515 --> 01:22:03.918
IT WAS AT FIRST -- STATED AS A

01:22:03.985 --> 01:22:05.920
TWO THIRDS VOTE -- AND NOW IT'S

01:22:05.987 --> 01:22:09.424
IT'S MAGICALLY NOT -- BECAUSE OF

01:22:09.491 --> 01:22:10.692
NO CHANGES IN THE AMOUNT OF

01:22:10.759 --> 01:22:11.960
MONEY THAT'S BEEN RAISED AND

01:22:12.027 --> 01:22:13.495
WHAT IS BEING SPENT FOR JUST HOW

01:22:13.561 --> 01:22:15.196
IT'S BEING CATEGORIZED IN THE IN

01:22:15.263 --> 01:22:20.402
THE STATUTE SO -- IF IT LOOKS

01:22:20.468 --> 01:22:22.237
LIKE A DUCK IN IT.

01:22:22.304 --> 01:22:23.305
SOUNDS LIKE A DUCK IT'S PROBABLY

01:22:23.371 --> 01:22:24.139
A DOCK SO IN THAT CASE WE WE

01:22:24.205 --> 01:22:26.775
BELIEVE THAT IT IS -- ATTACKS

01:22:26.841 --> 01:22:27.909
AND ONE POINT THAT MY COLLEAGUE

01:22:27.976 --> 01:22:29.311
MADE THAT WAS VERY VERY

01:22:29.377 --> 01:22:30.612
IMPORTANT.

01:22:30.679 --> 01:22:32.247
GIVEN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:22:39.921 --> 01:22:40.922
OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN

01:22:40.989 --> 01:22:42.791
SURPLUS THERE WAS NO NEED TO

01:22:42.857 --> 01:22:44.993
RAISE THAT BE IT WAS OBVIOUS

01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:45.360
THAT.

01:22:45.427 --> 01:22:46.695
DURING THAT TIME OF THE AMOUNT

01:22:46.761 --> 01:22:49.397
OF MONEY THAT WAS ALLOCATED FOR

01:22:49.464 --> 01:22:50.665

01:23:08.416 --> 01:23:10.418
GREAT EXTENT A AND THAT THAT

01:23:10.485 --> 01:23:13.088

THERE IS ADDITIONAL DATA -- AND

01:35:37.832 --> 01:35:39.166
YOU KNOW I I CAN READ A LIST

01:35:39.233 --> 01:35:39.867
HERE FROM THINGS LIKE THE DOCKET

01:35:39.934 --> 01:35:40.835

COURT APPOINTED COUNSEL.

01:35:43.804 --> 01:35:44.705
IF THERE'S A DISPOSITION OF

01:35:44.772 --> 01:35:46.540
DEFERRED ENTRY OF JUDGMENT A LOT

01:35:46.607 --> 01:35:48.609
OF SENTENCING DATA -- SUCH AS

01:35:48.676 --> 01:35:49.310

SO WE THINK THAT'LL IMPORT

01:35:57.184 --> 01:35:58.285
INFORMATION THE MORE DATA POINTS

01:35:58.352 --> 01:35:59.954
THE BETTER WE CAN UNDERSTAND OUR

01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:02.690

THIRTY DAYS WE THINK THAT'S FAR

01:36:24.545 --> 01:36:25.813
TOO LONG THE GOLD STANDARD

01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:27.148

CONVICTED OF A CRIME

01:36:39.059 --> 01:36:40.194
DISQUALIFIES YOU FROM OWNING A

01:36:40.261 --> 01:36:42.463
HANDGUN BUT BEFORE IT SUPPORTING

01:36:42.530 --> 01:36:45.399
GO GET A HANDGUN -- THIS SAME

01:36:45.466 --> 01:36:46.834
WITH SOME OF THAT COULD PUT YOU

01:36:46.901 --> 01:36:48.702
ON THE APPS PROHIBIT PERSONS

01:36:48.769 --> 01:36:56.443

01:38:18.692 --> 01:38:19.660
CONCERN IS A LISA MONIKERS.

01:38:19.727 --> 01:38:20.928
AND THEN WE'RE JUST LOOKING FOR

01:38:20.995 --> 01:38:22.963
SUCH ST CLARITY ON WHETHER IT'S

01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:24.131

HARD COPY.

01:39:00.134 --> 01:39:00.734
IT'S NOT EVEN ELECTRONIC -- SO

01:39:00.801 --> 01:39:02.303
WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT WE

THIS BILL.

01:39:21.655 --> 01:39:23.257
SIXTY MANY CLARIFY IRA CONCERNS

01:39:23.324 --> 01:39:24.358
WOULD IT MAKE SURE SYSTEMS COULD

SPEAK TO THE DOJ SYSTEMS ARE

01:39:25.993 --> 01:39:27.695

ORGANIZATION? FIFTY EIGHT

01:39:43.143 --> 01:39:43.677
DIFFERENT SYSTEMS -- AT WHAT

VENDORS THAT THEY CONTRACT WITH --

01:39:50.517 --> 01:39:52.853
AND THOSE VENDORS WILL COME AND

01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:54.488
TO IF OBVIOUSLY IF THIS BILL

01:39:54.555 --> 01:39:55.422
WERE TO BECOME LAW THEN DOES

01:39:55.489 --> 01:39:56.690
WHEN VENDORS WOULD HAVE TO COME

01:39:56.757 --> 01:39:56.857

BRAND NEW WITH CASE MANAGEMENT

01:40:05.466 --> 01:40:06.667
SYSTEM -- FOR THESE AGENCIES TO

BE ABLE TO MEET THIS MANDATE AND

01:40:08.869 --> 01:40:10.070
OF COURSE THOSE ARE.

01:40:10.137 --> 01:40:11.271
THOSE HAVE HUGE COSTS ASSOCIATED

01:40:11.338 --> 01:40:11.972
WITH THEM.

01:40:12.039 --> 01:40:13.974
AND ALSO NOT TO MENTION -- THAT

01:40:14.041 --> 01:40:14.608
STAFFING THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE

01:40:14.675 --> 01:40:18.545
ON A WEEKLY BASIS TO BE ABLE --

01:40:18.612 --> 01:40:20.447
TO MEET THIS -- MANDATE TO RIGHT

01:40:20.514 --> 01:40:21.448
NOW YOU'RE USING HARD COPY IN

EMAILS TO GET DATA.

01:40:22.783 --> 01:40:24.418
WELL SOME OBVIOUSLY SOME LOCAL

01:40:24.485 --> 01:40:26.186
AGENCIES ON THAT ARE SMALLER AND

01:40:26.253 --> 01:40:28.455
DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES YES AND

01:40:28.522 --> 01:40:30.491
THAT SOME -- ARE MUCH MORE

01:40:30.557 --> 01:40:32.926
UPDATED AND YOU KNOW DAY ODD

01:40:32.993 --> 01:40:34.862
THEY DO USE A MUCH MORE UPDATED

01:40:34.928 --> 01:40:39.633
THAT -- EQUIPMENT TO BE ABLE --

01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:41.568
TO DO REGULAR CURRENTLY PARTING.

01:40:41.635 --> 01:40:45.339
SO WITH SO THIS IS SORT OF A

01:40:45.406 --> 01:40:48.575
BOTTOM UP PROPOSAL.

01:40:48.642 --> 01:40:49.843
WHY ARE WE LOOKING AT A TOP DOWN

01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:52.713
WHAT WE CAN TO GET UNIFORM?

01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:53.947
SO IT IS LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT I

01:40:54.014 --> 01:40:55.249
CAN A PHONE NUMBER ON MY

01:40:55.315 --> 01:40:56.617
CELLPHONE IT AUTOMATICALLY

01:40:56.683 --> 01:40:57.384
STORES AND I'M DONE I DON'T HAVE

01:40:57.451 --> 01:40:59.186
TO EMAIL SOMEONE -- YOU KNOW

01:40:59.253 --> 01:41:01.588
JUST IT WOULD GET BETTER I. T.

01:41:01.655 --> 01:41:03.323
LIKE I KNOW THAT THE DANGEROUS

01:41:03.390 --> 01:41:06.994
AREA CALIFORNIA BUT WHY ARE WE

01:41:07.060 --> 01:41:09.530
WHY ARE WE IMPOSING THIS ON

01:41:09.596 --> 01:41:11.165
MULTIPLE VENDORS WHEN WE MIGHT

01:41:11.231 --> 01:41:11.965
WANT TO START FROM THE TOP AND

01:41:12.032 --> 01:41:13.267
WORK FOR DOWN A REALLY GET THE

01:41:13.333 --> 01:41:14.601
WHOLE SYSTEM FOR ALL OF STATE.

01:41:14.668 --> 01:41:16.570
FIXED.

01:41:16.637 --> 01:41:17.704
A LOT OF THE DATA LIVES IN IN IN

01:41:17.771 --> 01:41:19.473
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES

01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:20.974
AND WITH COURT SO IT IF IT STAYS

01:41:21.041 --> 01:41:21.942
THERE IT DOESN'T GET REPORTED TO

01:41:22.009 --> 01:41:23.310
A CENTRAL CLARING HOUSE SO WE

01:41:23.377 --> 01:41:23.944
NEED THE REPORTING.

01:41:24.011 --> 01:41:25.512
THAT SO THAT IT DOES GO TO A

01:41:25.579 --> 01:41:28.182
STATEWIDE DATABASE -- AND THAT

01:41:28.248 --> 01:41:29.683
WE NEED -- BOMB PLATFORMS AND

01:41:29.750 --> 01:41:30.717
TECHSYSTEMS THAT SPEAK WITH ONE

01:41:30.784 --> 01:41:31.952
ANOTHER SO THAT THE INFORMATION

01:41:32.019 --> 01:41:32.953
CAN BE SHARED IT DOES

01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:34.621
UNFORTUNATELY.

01:41:34.688 --> 01:41:36.123
REQUIRE SHARING IT THE DOJ HAD

01:41:36.190 --> 01:41:37.324
ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION ON

01:41:37.391 --> 01:41:39.726
ITS OWN INDEPENDENT FROM LAW

01:41:39.793 --> 01:41:40.694
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN COURTS

01:41:40.761 --> 01:41:41.995
THIS WOULD BE NECESSARY BUT THIS

01:41:42.062 --> 01:41:43.263
IS ABOUT SHARING INFORMATION

01:41:43.330 --> 01:41:45.299
ACROSS JURISDICTIONS SO THAT

01:41:45.365 --> 01:41:47.134
WHEN AND AND THE DECISION ABOUT

01:41:47.201 --> 01:41:47.701
AN INDIVIDUAL THE CAMANCHE

01:41:47.768 --> 01:41:48.402
JUSTICE SYSTEM IS MADE.

01:41:48.469 --> 01:41:49.570
ALL DATA COMES TO BEAR ON THAT

01:41:49.636 --> 01:41:51.038
INDIVIDUAL AND THE DECISION

01:41:51.104 --> 01:41:53.273
BEING MADE IS AVAILABLE TO THE

01:41:53.340 --> 01:41:54.441
DECISION MAKER SO THAT I CAN BE

01:41:54.508 --> 01:41:55.676
FAIR.

01:41:55.742 --> 01:41:57.478
AND SAFE -- WORK WE'RE

01:41:57.544 --> 01:42:00.080
DEFINITELY -- THE ARE BILLED AS

01:42:00.147 --> 01:42:01.014
A DETAIL ALL THAT YOU KNOW

01:42:01.081 --> 01:42:01.548
DOESN'T IDENTIFY SPECIFIC

01:42:01.615 --> 01:42:03.317
PLATFORM -- AND WE WANT TO

01:42:03.383 --> 01:42:05.219
CREATE SOME FLEXIBILITY SO THAT --

01:42:05.285 --> 01:42:06.687
THAT THERE COULD BE DIFFERENT

01:42:06.753 --> 01:42:08.889
OPTIONS THAT WERE AFFORDABLE AND

01:42:08.956 --> 01:42:09.790
MADE SENSE.

01:42:09.857 --> 01:42:12.192
BUT IF THEY DO NEED TO SPEAK

01:42:12.259 --> 01:42:13.427
WITH ONE ANOTHER SO THAT SO THE

01:42:13.494 --> 01:42:18.298
DATA CAN BECOME A JUSTICE DATA

01:42:18.365 --> 01:42:22.669
CAN BE SHARED.

01:42:22.736 --> 01:42:26.540
IT MAY MAY.

01:42:26.607 --> 01:42:27.741
THANK YOU -- SO I WOULD SAY THAT

01:42:27.808 --> 01:42:29.009
WHILE IT MAY SOUND IDEAL TO HAVE

01:42:29.076 --> 01:42:29.576
ONE CENTRALIZED SYSTEM FOR

01:42:29.643 --> 01:42:30.110
ENTIRE STATE I THINK THAT

01:42:30.177 --> 01:42:32.279
ACTUALLY THERE IS SORT OF UP.

01:42:32.346 --> 01:42:33.213
THERE THAT CREATES ITS OWN

01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:33.847
ROADBLOCKS NOT ONLY WOULD IT BE

01:42:33.914 --> 01:42:34.448
POTENTIALLY VERY EXPENSIVE --

01:42:34.515 --> 01:42:35.782
BUT SOMETIMES HAVING ONE BIG

01:42:35.849 --> 01:42:37.317
SYSTEM IT CAN KIND OF TRAP YOU

01:42:37.384 --> 01:42:39.353
MORE THAN THAT INNOVATION THAT

01:42:39.419 --> 01:42:41.421
YOU CAN THAT CAN ARISE FROM

01:42:41.488 --> 01:42:42.155
HAVING MANY SYSTEMS.

01:42:42.222 --> 01:42:43.323
THAT MAY SOUND BETTER TO HAVE

01:42:43.390 --> 01:42:44.124
ONE BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT

01:42:44.191 --> 01:42:45.192
ACTUALLY IS BETTER IN THE MODERN

01:42:45.259 --> 01:42:46.527
TECHNOLOGICAL ERA AND I WOULD

01:42:46.593 --> 01:42:48.095
ALSO SAY THAT TECHNOLOGY HAS

01:42:48.161 --> 01:42:49.263
ADVANCED TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT

01:42:49.329 --> 01:42:50.330
WE DON'T ALL NEED TO HAVE THE

01:42:50.397 --> 01:42:52.366
SAME SYSTEM. FOR OUR SYSTEMS TO

01:42:52.432 --> 01:42:53.834
BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE

01:42:53.901 --> 01:42:55.369
EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY -- I

01:42:55.435 --> 01:42:58.105
THINK THAT THE EXAMPLE OF THAT

01:42:58.171 --> 01:42:59.006
FIVE TO TEN VENDORS ACROSS THE

01:42:59.072 --> 01:43:00.707
STATE ALL OF THOSE VENDORS ARE

01:43:00.774 --> 01:43:03.143
ABSOLUTELY CAPABLE OF MAKING

01:43:03.210 --> 01:43:04.645
MODIFICATIONS TO THEIR SYSTEM TO

01:43:04.711 --> 01:43:06.413
THEN REPORT FROM EVERY SINGLE

01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:07.814
ONE OF THOSE COUNTY COURTS

01:43:07.881 --> 01:43:09.182
DIRECTLY TO THE STATE.

01:43:09.249 --> 01:43:10.117
I'M IN THE SAME WOULD BE TRUE

01:43:10.183 --> 01:43:11.652
FOR ANY RECORDS MANAGEMENT

01:43:11.718 --> 01:43:12.553
SYSTEM.

01:43:12.619 --> 01:43:14.054
I'M IN A LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:43:14.121 --> 01:43:15.522
AGENCY IN THERE'S BOTH FEDERAL

01:43:15.589 --> 01:43:17.925
AND STATE WIDE INITIATIVES TO

01:43:17.991 --> 01:43:19.560
ADVANCE THAT KIND OF THAT DATA

01:43:19.626 --> 01:43:21.628
SHARING THAT ALLOWS US TO HAVE

01:43:21.695 --> 01:43:22.429
DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES THAT

01:43:22.496 --> 01:43:23.797
ESSENTIALLY SPEAK THE SAME

01:43:23.864 --> 01:43:25.866
LANGUAGE AND SO WE KIND OF GET.

01:43:25.933 --> 01:43:27.935
TO A WE GET TO THE TOP APPROACH

01:43:28.001 --> 01:43:30.637
WHERE WE HAVE CENTRALIZED DATA

01:43:30.704 --> 01:43:32.039
COUNTIES AND AGENCIES TO HAVE

01:43:32.105 --> 01:43:36.610
SYSTEMS THAT WORK BETTER FOR

01:43:36.677 --> 01:43:39.947
THEM ON THE GROUND.

01:43:40.013 --> 01:43:41.481

THAT LANGUAGE WAS DRAFTED

01:52:55.401 --> 01:52:56.870
ADDITIONAL ELEMENT TO WHAT I

BUT IT ISN'T A FULLY COORDINATED.

02:08:04.943 --> 02:08:05.744
SO WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE

02:08:05.811 --> 02:08:07.046
THAT THIS CONSOLIDATED.

02:08:07.112 --> 02:08:09.448

02:08:44.917 --> 02:08:46.085
BUT I THINK IN THERE WITH COULD

02:08:46.151 --> 02:08:48.654
BE AN ARGUMENT THAT THIS WE HAVE

02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:50.522

WE HAVE -- COME TO UNDERSTAND

02:08:58.430 --> 02:09:00.432
WHICH WERE CLEARLY IS THAT GUN

02:09:00.499 --> 02:09:04.002
VIOLENCE IS NOT PRIMARILY A

02:09:04.069 --> 02:09:05.104
CRIMINAL JUSTICE ISSUE.

02:09:05.170 --> 02:09:07.840
IT IS A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE.

02:09:07.906 --> 02:09:09.908

FROM THAT PUBLIC HEALTH POINT OF

02:09:13.979 --> 02:09:15.047
VIEW.

02:09:15.114 --> 02:09:17.583
PERHAPS WE CAN GET AT EITHER THE

02:09:17.649 --> 02:09:19.351

02:09:27.159 --> 02:09:29.128
JUST GOING THROUGH THE LENS OF

02:09:29.194 --> 02:09:30.996
CRIMINAL JUSTICE MIGHT NOT KNOW

02:09:31.063 --> 02:09:32.297
WHILE THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY

02:09:32.364 --> 02:09:35.567

CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE THE

02:37:00.944 --> 02:37:03.547
ABILITY TO CLEAR THEIR RECORDS.

02:37:03.614 --> 02:37:05.382
WHO HAVEN'T YET PARTLY BECAUSE

WE'RE PROPOSING A STREAMLINED

02:37:08.485 --> 02:37:09.787
APPROACH ON HOW TO DO THAT WE'VE

02:37:09.853 --> 02:37:11.555
BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH

02:37:11.622 --> 02:37:13.190
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE.

02:37:15.926 --> 02:37:18.462
THAT CAN BE SHARED WITH THE

02:37:18.529 --> 02:37:19.496
FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES.

02:37:19.563 --> 02:37:21.598
THAT DATABASE THEN CAN BE USED

02:37:21.665 --> 02:37:23.400
TO NOT RELEASE INFORMATION WHEN

02:37:23.467 --> 02:37:24.268

CURRENT LAW CAUSES THOSE CHARGED

WITH MISDEMEANORS TO HAVE TO

02:50:15.638 --> 02:50:16.906

02:50:25.381 --> 02:50:26.049
MISCONDUCT.

02:50:26.115 --> 02:50:27.283
THAT MISCONDUCT EVIDENCE IS A

02:50:27.350 --> 02:50:28.585
CONFIDENTIAL BECAUSE IT'S

02:50:28.651 --> 02:50:29.652
CONTAINED WITHIN THE POLICE

02:50:29.719 --> 02:50:30.720

02:50:30.787 --> 02:50:32.989
IT MAY ONLY BE THE ONLY EVIDENCE

02:50:33.056 --> 02:50:34.324

02:50:38.828 --> 02:50:39.963
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS.

02:50:40.029 --> 02:50:41.297
A DEFENSE ATTORNEY CAN SEEK

02:50:41.364 --> 02:50:42.632

02:50:43.967 --> 02:50:45.001
IN THE PAST INCLUDING

02:50:45.068 --> 02:50:46.269

PERSON'S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS.

02:50:50.340 --> 02:50:52.175
THEY DO SO BY FILING A MOTION

02:50:52.241 --> 02:50:52.942
FOR DISCOVERY CALLED THE PITCHES

02:50:53.009 --> 02:50:54.277
pMOTION THE DEFENSE ATTORNEY

02:50:54.344 --> 02:50:55.812
NEEDS TO BE VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT

02:50:55.878 --> 02:50:57.246
WHAT INFORMATION IS BEING

02:50:57.313 --> 02:50:59.215
REQUESTED AND WHY IT'S IMPORTANT.

02:50:59.282 --> 02:51:01.250
IN MY OWN EXPERIENCE I'VE SEEN

02:51:01.317 --> 02:51:02.385
THAT THE RESULT OF A SUCCESSFUL

02:51:02.452 --> 02:51:04.153
PITCHES MOTION CAN BECAUSE THE

02:51:04.220 --> 02:51:05.655
PROSECUTION TO DISMISS THE CASE.

02:51:05.722 --> 02:51:08.091
AND IT CAN HELP THE THE DEFENSE

02:51:08.157 --> 02:51:09.926
WAY TO PROVE THAT SOMEONE IS

02:51:09.993 --> 02:51:10.727
INNOCENT OF THE CHARGES AGAINST

02:51:10.793 --> 02:51:12.462
THEM. ONE OF THE CURRENT

02:51:12.528 --> 02:51:14.831
PROBLEMS A. B. C.'S AB SIXTEEN

02:51:14.897 --> 02:51:16.232
HUNDRED SIX TO FIX IS THAT THE

02:51:16.299 --> 02:51:17.233
PROCESS FOR HEARING ON A PITCHES

02:51:17.300 --> 02:51:19.636
MOTION SIMPLY TAKES TOO LONG.

02:51:19.702 --> 02:51:21.337
IT HAS AN EXCESSIVELY LONG

02:51:21.404 --> 02:51:22.772
NOTICE REQUIREMENT OF SIXTEEN

02:51:22.839 --> 02:51:24.073
COURT DAYS.

02:51:24.140 --> 02:51:25.041
THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE WITH

02:51:25.108 --> 02:51:26.376
WHEN NEARLY ALL THE OTHER

02:51:26.442 --> 02:51:27.443
MOTIONS THAT WE FILING CRIMINAL

02:51:27.510 --> 02:51:29.278
COURT REQUIRES JUST TEN DAYS

02:51:29.345 --> 02:51:30.146
NOTICE.

02:51:30.213 --> 02:51:31.614
IF WE WERE REDUCE THIS PROCESS

02:51:31.681 --> 02:51:34.484
BY JUST SIX DAYS FROM SIXTEEN

02:51:34.550 --> 02:51:35.918
COURT DAYS OF NO. TO TEN COURT

02:51:35.985 --> 02:51:37.387
DAYS OF NOTICE WE WOULD PROVIDE

02:51:37.453 --> 02:51:38.688
MORE MISDEMEANOR DEFENDANTS WITH

02:51:38.755 --> 02:51:40.056
ACCESS TO IMPORTANT DISCOVERY

02:51:40.123 --> 02:51:42.759
WITHOUT FORCING THEM TO WAIVE

02:51:42.825 --> 02:51:44.460
THEIR RIGHT TO A SPEEDY TRIAL.

02:51:44.527 --> 02:51:45.561
THE OPPOSITION ARGUES THAT

02:51:45.628 --> 02:51:46.396
SHORTENING THIS NURSES NOTICE

02:51:46.462 --> 02:51:48.431
REQUIREMENT FROM SIXTEEN DAYS TO

02:51:48.498 --> 02:51:49.899
TEN DAYS WOULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT

02:51:49.966 --> 02:51:52.135
TO WRITE ANY WRITTEN OBJECTIONS

02:51:52.201 --> 02:51:53.703
IN OPPOSITION AND MAKE A

02:51:53.770 --> 02:51:55.438
DILIGENT SEARCH FOR RECORDS.

02:51:55.505 --> 02:51:56.406
WHICH THEY SAY WOULD MAKE IT

02:51:56.472 --> 02:51:57.907
HARDER FOR THEM TO PREPARE

02:51:57.974 --> 02:51:59.409
MEANINGFUL OPPOSITIONS TO

02:51:59.475 --> 02:52:00.076
PURCHASE MOTIONS.

02:52:00.143 --> 02:52:02.512
BUT IN MY EXPERIENCE MOST CITY

02:52:02.578 --> 02:52:03.813
ATTORNEY'S JUST BROADLY OBJECT

02:52:03.880 --> 02:52:05.014
AND SIMPLY ARGUE THAT THE

02:52:05.081 --> 02:52:06.149
DEFENSE ATTORNEYS MOTIONS NOT

02:52:06.215 --> 02:52:07.917
SPECIFIC ENOUGH REGARDLESS OF

02:52:07.984 --> 02:52:08.918
WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S ACTUAL

02:52:08.985 --> 02:52:10.286
MERIT TO THE MOTION.

02:52:10.353 --> 02:52:12.221
ALSO CITY ATTORNEYS DO NOT

02:52:12.288 --> 02:52:13.322
ACTUALLY SEARCH THROUGH ANY THE

02:52:13.389 --> 02:52:15.091
RECORDS AT ALL THEIR JOB IS TO

02:52:15.158 --> 02:52:17.160
PROVIDE ALL THE POLICE OFFICERS

02:52:17.226 --> 02:52:18.528
RECORDS TO THE COURT.

02:52:18.594 --> 02:52:20.229
THEN THE COURT IS THE ONE THAT

02:52:20.296 --> 02:52:21.597
REVIEWS THESE POLICE RECORDS

02:52:21.664 --> 02:52:23.099
SORTS OUT WHAT INFORMATION IF

02:52:23.166 --> 02:52:24.634
ANY SHOULD THEN BE TURNED OVER

02:52:24.701 --> 02:52:25.868
TO THE DEFENSE.

02:52:25.935 --> 02:52:26.936
THIS CHANGE IN THE NOTICE

02:52:27.003 --> 02:52:28.171
REQUIREMENT FROM SIXTEEN CORE

02:52:28.237 --> 02:52:29.872
DAYS TO TEN COURT DATES WILL

02:52:29.939 --> 02:52:31.074
RESULT IN MORE EQUITY MORE

02:52:31.140 --> 02:52:32.875
TRANSPARENCY IN MORE FAIRNESS

02:52:32.942 --> 02:52:33.643
WITHIN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

02:52:33.710 --> 02:52:34.177

ESPECIALLY TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO

02:52:35.778 --> 02:52:36.779
ARE CHARGED WITH MISDEMEANORS

02:52:36.846 --> 02:52:38.581
AND WHO ARE IN CUSTODY AWAITING

02:52:38.648 --> 02:52:39.248
THEIR TRIALS.

02:52:39.315 --> 02:52:40.750
AFTER ALL WHEN PEOPLE HAVE MORE

02:52:40.817 --> 02:52:42.251
MEANINGFUL AND MORE TIMELY

ACCESS TO PROPER TOOLS AT THE

02:52:44.287 --> 02:52:45.455

02:52:45.521 --> 02:52:46.956
HAS IN PLACE.

02:52:47.023 --> 02:52:48.291
THEN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM

02:52:48.357 --> 02:52:49.525
WILL WORK BETTER FOR EVERYONE.

02:52:49.592 --> 02:52:51.027

BADLY BEATEN HIM UP.

02:53:47.250 --> 02:53:48.184
AND THAT THE CHARGES WERE AN

02:53:48.251 --> 02:53:49.185
ATTEMPT TO COVER UP FOR THE

02:53:49.252 --> 02:53:51.187
BEATING.

02:53:51.254 --> 02:53:54.157
THE REST WAS MADE -- AND ON ON

02:53:54.223 --> 02:53:55.925
SCENE BUT THE SUPERVISOR WAS NOT

02:53:55.992 --> 02:53:57.560
ON SCENE DURING THE ARREST.

02:53:57.627 --> 02:53:59.529
IN OUR INVESTIGATION IT APPEARED

02:53:59.595 --> 02:54:01.063
THAT THE R. ARRESTING OFFICER

02:54:01.130 --> 02:54:02.999
WHO MADE THE ARREST HAD TALKED

02:54:03.065 --> 02:54:04.133
TO HIS SUPERVISOR ABOUT WHAT TO

02:54:04.200 --> 02:54:05.635
WRITE IN THE POLICE REPORT THERE

02:54:05.701 --> 02:54:07.103
WERE SEVERAL DRAFTS OF THE

02:54:07.170 --> 02:54:08.004
POLICE REPORT THAT WE WHAT WE

02:54:08.070 --> 02:54:08.871
SAW.

02:54:08.938 --> 02:54:10.439
AND WE ACTUALLY EVEN RECEIVED A

02:54:10.506 --> 02:54:12.441
SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT AUTHORED BY

02:54:12.508 --> 02:54:13.309
THE ARRESTING OFFICER WITH

02:54:13.376 --> 02:54:15.244
SUSPICIOUS NEW DETAILS THAT WERE

02:54:15.311 --> 02:54:17.513
CONTRADICTED BY GRAINY BODY

CAMERA FOOTAGE.

02:54:18.915 --> 02:54:20.349
I SUSPECTED THAT THE SUPERVISING

02:54:20.416 --> 02:54:22.785

STOOD UP IN COURT.

02:54:28.391 --> 02:54:30.293
UNDER EXISTING LAW I WAS

02:54:30.359 --> 02:54:32.195
POWERLESS HOWEVER TO GET

02:54:33.663 --> 02:54:35.131
SUPERVISOR.

02:54:35.198 --> 02:54:37.300
THIS IS BECAUSE THE SUPERVISOR

02:54:37.366 --> 02:54:38.034
WAS NOT PRESENT DURING THE

02:54:38.100 --> 02:54:39.869
ARREST AND HAD NO DIRECT CONTACT

02:54:39.936 --> 02:54:41.938
WITH MY CLIENT.

02:54:42.004 --> 02:54:43.739
AB SIXTEEN HUNDRED MAKES A

CODE THAT FIXES THIS PROBLEM

02:54:47.210 --> 02:54:49.045
THIS BILL WILL NOW ALLOW PEOPLE

02:54:58.788 --> 02:55:00.389
THERE HAVE BEEN MANY REPORTS OF

02:55:00.456 --> 02:55:01.991
A STRONG CODE OF SILENCE THAT

02:55:02.058 --> 02:55:03.626
EXISTS AMONG SOME LAW

02:55:03.693 --> 02:55:05.561

NEARLY ALWAYS GRANTED.

02:58:27.329 --> 02:58:28.164
THIS BILL WOULD ESSENTIALLY

NOW ACCORDING TO SOME OF OUR

03:00:13.669 --> 03:00:14.170
CITY ATTORNEYS TO HEAR SOME

GROUPS SHARE OUR ARE CONCERNED.

03:09:34.029 --> 03:09:35.864
THE THE PROBLEM IS THE TWO FOLD

THERE'S THE THE 10% THRESHOLD

03:09:38.033 --> 03:09:40.168
REQUIRED FOR VOLUNTEERS AND

ESSENTIALLY NONPROFIT STAFF TO

QUALIFY FOR TRUE GRASSROOTS --

03:09:45.507 --> 03:09:47.743
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE REALLY

03:09:47.809 --> 03:09:48.643
USING.

03:09:48.710 --> 03:09:50.545
VOLUNTEERS THAT WILL BE VERY

03:09:50.612 --> 03:09:52.781
CHALLENGING THRESHOLD IN THE SIX

03:09:52.848 --> 03:09:54.082
MONTH PERIOD THAT YOU HAVE FOR

03:09:54.149 --> 03:09:55.817
THE NATIONAL PROCESS.

03:09:55.884 --> 03:09:56.685
ESPECIALLY.

03:09:56.752 --> 03:09:58.120
IF IT HAPPENS TO BE RAINY SEASON

03:09:58.186 --> 03:09:59.354
DURING THOSE SIX MONTHS FOR REAL

03:09:59.421 --> 03:10:01.156
VOLUNTEERS TO GET THAT MANY

03:10:01.223 --> 03:10:03.425
SIGNATURES -- AND THEN SECONDLY

03:10:03.492 --> 03:10:05.093
POSSIBLY EVEN MORE CONCERNING IS

03:10:05.160 --> 03:10:05.594
THE BAN ON PAYMENTS FOR

03:10:05.660 --> 03:10:07.963
SIGNATURE WHEN IT COMES TO THE

03:10:08.029 --> 03:10:10.632
ABILITY OF GRASSROOTS

03:10:10.699 --> 03:10:12.067
INITIATIVES REAL INITIATIVES.

03:10:12.134 --> 03:10:14.469
THAT ARE NOT SUPPORTED BY

03:10:14.536 --> 03:10:17.038
BILLION ERRORS OR OR SUPER --

03:10:17.105 --> 03:10:22.644
WEALTHY CORPORATIONS -- IT WILL

03:10:22.711 --> 03:10:24.446
INCREASE THE COST A IN IN SUCH A

03:10:24.513 --> 03:10:25.714
WAY THAT THAT. ONE EXAMPLE IT

03:10:25.781 --> 03:10:27.449
WAS A KEY PART OF A FLORIDA BILL

03:10:27.516 --> 03:10:28.583
THAT WAS JUST PASSED AND SIGNED

03:10:28.650 --> 03:10:30.218
INTO LAW IN FLORIDA WHO HAD THE

03:10:30.285 --> 03:10:32.053
VERY TRANSPARENT PURPOSE.

03:10:32.120 --> 03:10:33.955
OF WARNING THE CITIZENS INITIAL

03:10:34.022 --> 03:10:35.190
PROCESS IN FLORIDA.

03:10:35.257 --> 03:10:36.458
AND I'LL JUST QUOTE FROM A

03:10:36.525 --> 03:10:38.360
COUPLE OF FLORIDA NEWSPAPER AS

03:10:38.426 --> 03:10:39.561
THEIR THE SARASOTA HERALD

03:10:39.628 --> 03:10:41.530
TRIBUNE DESCRIBED THE BILL THEY

03:10:41.596 --> 03:10:43.131
PASS WOULD MAKE IT A CRIME. TO

03:10:43.198 --> 03:10:45.033
PAY PETITION GATHERERS BASED ON

03:10:45.100 --> 03:10:45.834
THE NUMBER OF SIGNATURES THEY

03:10:45.901 --> 03:10:46.701
COLLECT.

03:10:46.768 --> 03:10:48.036
THAT CHANGE THAT EXPERTS SAY

03:10:48.103 --> 03:10:50.238
WILL LIKELY DOUBLE THE COST OF

03:10:50.305 --> 03:10:51.773
GETTING PROPOSALS ON THE BALLOT.

03:10:51.840 --> 03:10:53.875
AND THAT IS PRECISELY WHY THE

03:10:53.942 --> 03:10:55.944
FLORIDA LEGISLATURE INCLUDED

03:10:56.011 --> 03:10:57.546
THAT AS A KEY PROVISION OF THEIR

03:10:57.612 --> 03:10:59.648
BILL THAT OTHER HEADLINES

03:10:59.714 --> 03:11:01.116
IMPORTED SAID FLORIDA LAWMAKERS

03:11:01.183 --> 03:11:03.285
PLACE BARRIERS TO BALLOT

03:11:03.351 --> 03:11:05.720
INITIATIVES IT WAS THE THIRD

03:11:05.787 --> 03:11:06.721
SOARED HIGH HERALD TRIBUNE.

03:11:06.788 --> 03:11:07.756
DORLAND A WEEKLY FLORIDA

03:11:07.823 --> 03:11:09.291
LAWMAKERS WANT TO MAKE IT HARDER

03:11:09.357 --> 03:11:09.925
FOR SEARCHES OF THE MISSION IS

03:11:09.991 --> 03:11:10.425
TO GET ON THE BALLOT.

03:11:10.492 --> 03:11:12.127
IT GOES ON AND ON SOME OF MORE

03:11:12.194 --> 03:11:14.129
MUCH MORE DESCRIPTIVE NEGATIVE

03:11:14.196 --> 03:11:16.364
IN TERMS OF THEIR GOALS TO

03:11:16.431 --> 03:11:18.099
THWART THE CITIZENS INITIATIVE

03:11:18.166 --> 03:11:19.601
PROCESS WE KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT

03:11:19.668 --> 03:11:20.035
THE AUTHORS CALL.

03:11:20.101 --> 03:11:22.470
WE ABSOLUTELY I APPRECIATE THAT --

03:11:22.537 --> 03:11:24.673
AND WE'VE BEEN HAPPY TO BE

03:11:24.739 --> 03:11:26.074
TALKING WITH HIM ABOUT POSSIBLE.

03:11:26.141 --> 03:11:28.777
SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEM ONE

03:11:28.844 --> 03:11:30.712
WOULD BE TO TO TO JUST LOWER THE

03:11:30.779 --> 03:11:32.247
THRESHOLD AND AND NOT HAVE THE

03:11:32.314 --> 03:11:34.149
BAN ON PAYMENTS PER SIGNATURE SO

03:11:34.216 --> 03:11:34.916
YOU DON'T HAVE THAT INCREASE IN

03:11:34.983 --> 03:11:35.817
COSTS.

03:11:35.884 --> 03:11:37.452
ANOTHER OPTION THAT WE'VE TALKED

03:11:37.519 --> 03:11:38.520
WITH HIM.

03:11:38.587 --> 03:11:40.255
THE OTHER EIGHT STATES THAT BAND

03:11:40.322 --> 03:11:42.691
PAYMENTS PER SIGNATURE ALL HAVE

03:11:42.757 --> 03:11:44.259
A MINIMUM OF ONE YEAR FOR

SIGNATURES TO BE GATHERED ONE

03:11:46.862 --> 03:11:47.696
YEAR IN MANY CASES TWO YEARS

03:11:47.762 --> 03:11:50.232
ARIZONA OREGON FLORIDA ALL HAVE

03:11:50.298 --> 03:11:51.299
TWO YEAR PERIODS ACTUALLY

03:11:51.366 --> 03:11:53.201
PERSISTENCE TO QUALIFY.

03:11:53.268 --> 03:11:54.169
IF YOU HAD THAT THEN -- THAT

03:11:54.236 --> 03:11:55.537
AMOUNT OF TIME TO THAT WOULD

03:11:55.604 --> 03:11:57.339
MAKE UP FOR THE ADDED COSTS OF

03:11:57.405 --> 03:11:58.373
BANNING PAYMENTS.

03:11:58.440 --> 03:11:59.774
UPPER SIGNATURE AND ALLOW TRUE

03:11:59.841 --> 03:12:01.743
VOLUNTEER BECAUSE TRUE VOLUNTEER

03:12:01.810 --> 03:12:04.079
CAMPAIGNS WOULD HAVE MORE TIME.

03:12:04.145 --> 03:12:05.614
TO GET SIGNATURES UNPAID WHICH

03:12:05.680 --> 03:12:06.648
IS I THINK WHAT WE WOULD ALL

03:12:06.715 --> 03:12:08.149
WANT AND WHICH IS THE PURPOSE OF

03:12:08.216 --> 03:12:09.384
THE SIGNATURE GATHERING OUT

03:12:09.451 --> 03:12:11.253
PROCESS SO WITH THAT WE RICK

03:12:11.319 --> 03:12:19.661
RESPECTFULLY WE'RE HAPY TO KEEP

03:12:19.728 --> 03:12:20.295

03:13:37.539 --> 03:13:39.074

03:13:39.140 --> 03:13:40.375

03:23:06.374 --> 03:23:07.608
THAT JUST HAPPEN OVERNIGHT AT

03:23:07.675 --> 03:23:08.242
THIS BEEN.

03:23:08.309 --> 03:23:09.610
MANY ITERATIONS OF THIS PIECE OF

03:23:09.677 --> 03:23:11.779
LEGISLATION TO WHICH IS IN CAPS

03:23:11.846 --> 03:23:13.014
LATE BEFORE CJ AND BOUNCE THE

03:23:13.080 --> 03:23:14.482
PROVISION I THINK A WITH THE

03:23:14.549 --> 03:23:15.683
COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES HERE.

03:23:15.750 --> 03:23:17.585
ACCURATELY REFLECTS THAT OF

03:23:17.652 --> 03:23:18.986
COURSE WILL BE COMPETING

03:23:19.053 --> 03:23:19.720
MEASURES BUT AS YOU HEARD WE'VE

03:23:19.787 --> 03:23:21.088
BEEN I TRYING TO WORK AS MUCH IN

03:23:21.155 --> 03:23:22.490
GOOD FAITH AND WILL CONTINUE TO

03:23:22.557 --> 03:23:24.792
DO SO WITH THE INDIVIDUALS IN

03:23:24.859 --> 03:23:26.561
OPPOSITION -- SHOULD THIS TO

03:23:26.627 --> 03:23:27.762
MOVE FORWARD AND SPECIFIC IN

03:23:27.828 --> 03:23:29.463
TERMS OF THE SIX MONTHS VERSUS

03:23:29.530 --> 03:23:30.631
TWELVE MONTHS COULD JUST COMMENT

03:23:30.698 --> 03:23:31.966
ON THAT YES -- I BELIEVE THAT

03:23:32.033 --> 03:23:33.634
THERE MIGHT BE SOME -- AT

03:23:33.701 --> 03:23:34.235
CHALLENGES WITH THE BE

03:23:34.302 --> 03:23:36.203
CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES -- BUT WE

03:23:36.270 --> 03:23:37.238
BELIEVE THAT THAT THAT TIME

03:23:37.305 --> 03:23:38.806
FRAME AT THIS POINT IS --

03:23:38.873 --> 03:23:40.441
SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO SEE

03:23:40.508 --> 03:23:41.309
MOVE FORWARD AS THE BILL

03:23:41.375 --> 03:23:42.710
PRESENTED BUT OF COURSE WILL BE

03:23:42.777 --> 03:23:51.586
CONTINUALLY HAPPY TO TALK TO

03:23:51.652 --> 03:23:53.120
OPPOSITION SHOULD THIS MOVE.

03:23:53.187 --> 03:23:54.555
FOR CENTER WIENER DO YOU HAVE

03:23:54.622 --> 03:23:55.323
ANY OTHER QUESTION SIR OKAY ANY

03:23:55.389 --> 03:23:59.927
OTHER FROM THE DíAS -- I JUST

03:23:59.994 --> 03:24:01.162
WONDER EXPRESS I APPRECIATE.

03:24:01.228 --> 03:24:03.364
THE FOLKS.

03:24:03.431 --> 03:24:04.765
AND COMING TO THE HEARING AND

03:24:04.832 --> 03:24:07.702
TESTIFYING AND THE CONCERN THAT.

03:24:07.768 --> 03:24:11.339
THE BILL WOULD -- BASICALLY

03:24:11.405 --> 03:24:14.308
FAVOR MONEYED INTERESTS IN TERMS

03:24:14.375 --> 03:24:16.444
OF THE N. INITIATIVE GATHERING.

03:24:16.510 --> 03:24:18.512
PROCESS AND I THINK THIS IS ONE

03:24:18.579 --> 03:24:21.148
OF THESE FUNDAMENTAL WHERE IT'S

03:24:21.215 --> 03:24:25.252
KIND OF IT -- I CAN SEE I CAN

03:24:25.319 --> 03:24:28.089
APPRECIATE THAT PERSPECTIVE.

03:24:28.155 --> 03:24:30.491
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THAT OCCURS

03:24:30.558 --> 03:24:31.826
BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM VERY

03:24:31.892 --> 03:24:35.062
PROBABLE TO ME ONLY BECAUSE OF

03:24:35.129 --> 03:24:37.298
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE SUCH A

03:24:37.365 --> 03:24:39.233
HUGE STATE [inaudible]

03:24:39.300 --> 03:24:42.003
AND UNFORTUNATELY THE ENTIRE

03:24:42.069 --> 03:24:43.771
INITIATIVE PROCESS IS SKEWED

03:24:43.838 --> 03:24:46.207
TOWARDS MONEYED INTERESTS.

03:24:46.273 --> 03:24:47.108
AND HAVING.

03:24:47.174 --> 03:24:50.177
OF HAVING THE INDIVIDUAL PAID

03:24:50.244 --> 03:24:53.547
SIGNATURE [inaudible]

03:24:53.614 --> 03:24:58.319
IT'S AT IT ALLOWS FOR THOSE

03:24:58.386 --> 03:25:00.054
MONIED INTERESTS TO BE BE ABLE

03:25:00.121 --> 03:25:01.422
ALMOST UNLIMITED NUMBERS OF

03:25:01.489 --> 03:25:04.892
PEOPLE -- TO THEN COLLECT

03:25:04.959 --> 03:25:06.494
SIGNATURES AND THEY HAVE A GREAT

03:25:06.560 --> 03:25:08.262
INCENTIVE BECAUSE THEY ARE AT

03:25:08.329 --> 03:25:09.664
PAID PER SIGNATURE.

03:25:09.730 --> 03:25:12.733
MOST OF OUR GRASSROOTS EFFORTS

03:25:12.800 --> 03:25:14.735
PEOPLE ARE MOTIVATED OBVIOUSLY

03:25:14.802 --> 03:25:15.670
BY.

03:25:15.736 --> 03:25:17.571
MORE THAN MONEY IN TERMS OF THAT

03:25:17.638 --> 03:25:20.508
SIGNATURE GATHERING PROCESS IS

03:25:20.574 --> 03:25:22.610
STILL GOING TO BE DIFFICULT FOR

03:25:22.677 --> 03:25:24.745
GRASSROOTS EFFORTS -- TO GET

03:25:24.812 --> 03:25:27.281
THINGS ON A BALLOT IN CALIFORNIA.

03:25:27.348 --> 03:25:28.816
AND WE KNOW THAT WE'VE KNOWN

03:25:28.883 --> 03:25:30.418
THAT FOR A LONG TIME I DON'T

03:25:30.484 --> 03:25:31.285
KNOW.

03:25:31.352 --> 03:25:33.054
QUITE WHAT REFORMS WE'D HAVE TO

03:25:33.120 --> 03:25:35.389
DO TO DEAL WITH THAT GIVEN THAT

03:25:35.456 --> 03:25:38.192
WE ARE A STATE OF FORTY MILLION

03:25:38.259 --> 03:25:40.661
PEOPLE -- BUT I AM WILLING TO

03:25:40.728 --> 03:25:42.329
HAVE THE BILL MOVE.

03:25:42.396 --> 03:25:44.265
AND I DO APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S

03:25:44.331 --> 03:25:45.666
SHOWING UP AND I DON'T MEAN TO

03:25:45.733 --> 03:25:47.501
INVALIDATE THEIR CONCERNS BUT I

03:25:47.568 --> 03:25:49.837
THINK IT'S ONE OF THOSE WHERE

03:25:49.904 --> 03:25:54.108
IT'S A. -- WHETHER WE FEEL THAT

03:25:54.175 --> 03:25:55.643
THE INDIVIDUAL PAYING PER

03:25:55.710 --> 03:25:57.611
INDIVIDUAL SIGNATURE OR MAKE IT

03:25:57.678 --> 03:25:59.447
LET MORE EXPENSIVE OR PAYING

03:25:59.513 --> 03:26:02.416
FROM BY OUR IN FACT AND I THINK

03:26:02.483 --> 03:26:04.685
THAT'S THE THAT'S THOSE ARE.

03:26:04.752 --> 03:26:06.620
THE LEGITIMATE DEBATABLE POINT

03:26:06.687 --> 03:26:06.921
[inaudible]

03:26:06.987 --> 03:26:10.725
ON ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOU MAY CLOSE

03:26:10.791 --> 03:26:12.226
THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- FOR THE

REITERATE AND WE FROM THE POINT

03:26:14.495 --> 03:26:15.896
THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN STILL BE

03:26:15.963 --> 03:26:17.264
PAID BY STIPEND AND OUR HOURLY

03:26:17.331 --> 03:26:19.333
SO -- INDIVIDUAL STILL HAVE THAT

03:26:19.400 --> 03:26:20.901
OPPORTUNITY BUT AGAIN JUST NOT

03:26:20.968 --> 03:26:22.236
TO BE INCENTIVIZE BY THAT

03:26:22.303 --> 03:26:23.504
SIGNATURES THAT WE CAN HAVE A

03:26:23.571 --> 03:26:24.972
ROBUST CONVERSATION ABOUT THE

03:26:25.039 --> 03:26:25.806
INTEGRITY.
