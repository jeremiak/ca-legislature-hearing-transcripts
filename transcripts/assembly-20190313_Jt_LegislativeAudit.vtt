00:33:13.024 --> 00:33:14.959
COMMITTEES THAT ARE HERE TODAY

00:33:15.026 --> 00:33:15.760
FOR THE RECORD MY NAME IS ELAINE

00:33:15.827 --> 00:33:17.161
HOW ON THE CALIFORNIA STATE

00:33:17.228 --> 00:33:18.896
AUDITOR. TO MY RIGHT IS AMANDA

00:33:18.963 --> 00:33:20.765
MELON AMANDA WAS THE AUDIT TEAM

00:33:20.832 --> 00:33:23.234
SUPERVISOR WORKING WITH STAFF

00:33:23.301 --> 00:33:25.470
OUT AT THE HOMES PRIMARILY WE

00:33:25.536 --> 00:33:26.871
SPENT A LOT OF TIME AT YOUNG

00:33:26.938 --> 00:33:28.306
BILL BECAUSE THEY HAVE --

00:33:28.373 --> 00:33:29.807
THE MAJORITY OF THE LEASES THAT

00:33:29.874 --> 00:33:31.242
WE LOOKED AT BUT WE ALSO SPENT

00:33:31.309 --> 00:33:33.077
SOME TIME AT SOME OF THE OTHER

00:33:33.144 --> 00:33:34.045
HOMES AS WELL.

00:33:34.112 --> 00:33:36.214
SO TO LAY OUT WHAT WE'RE GOING

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:38.082
TO PRESENT WE HAD ACTUALLY THREE

00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:40.451
KEY ISSUES IN THE AUDIT REPORT.

00:33:40.518 --> 00:33:42.019
THE FIRST ISSUE IS RELATED TO

00:33:42.086 --> 00:33:44.355
THE AGREE --

00:33:44.422 --> 00:33:45.990
THE HOMES ENTERED INTO WITH

00:33:46.057 --> 00:33:47.992
VARIOUS ENTITIES AND CONCERNS WE

00:33:48.059 --> 00:33:50.061
HAD WITH THOSE LEASES THE LENGTH

00:33:50.128 --> 00:33:51.062
OF THE LACES SOME OF THE TERMS

00:33:51.129 --> 00:33:52.163
IN THE LEASES.

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:54.399
THE SECOND ISSUE IS RELATED TO

00:33:54.465 --> 00:33:56.134
ACTUALLY COLLECTING REVENUE

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.702
COLLECTING --

00:33:57.769 --> 00:33:59.203
THE THE LEASE REVENUE OTHER

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:00.938
TYPES OF PAYMENTS EMPLOYEE

00:34:01.005 --> 00:34:02.573
HOUSING PAYMENTS THOSE SORTS OF

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:04.542
THINGS WE HAD SOME CONCERNS WITH

00:34:04.609 --> 00:34:05.676
RESPECT TO THAT.

00:34:05.743 --> 00:34:07.545
AND THE LAST ISSUE WAS --

00:34:07.612 --> 00:34:09.747
AND AMANDA WILL COVER THE THE

00:34:09.814 --> 00:34:12.016
THIRD ISSUE RELATED --

00:34:12.083 --> 00:34:13.484
TO THE STATE REALLY BEING PUT AT

00:34:13.551 --> 00:34:15.586
RISK IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE

00:34:15.653 --> 00:34:17.121
THERE ARE EVENTS OCCURRING

00:34:17.188 --> 00:34:18.055
PARTICULARLY AT THE I DON'T FEEL

00:34:18.122 --> 00:34:20.191
FACILITY WHERE THE STATE DIDN'T

00:34:20.258 --> 00:34:21.692
HAVE A WRITTEN AGREEMENT AND

00:34:21.759 --> 00:34:22.994
REALLY DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING THAT

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:24.128
WOULD PROTECT.

00:34:24.195 --> 00:34:25.596
THE STATE AGAINST ANY POTENTIAL

00:34:25.663 --> 00:34:27.565
LIABILITY PROPERTY DAMAGE THOSE

00:34:27.632 --> 00:34:29.467
SORTS OF THINGS NOW WE DON'T

00:34:29.534 --> 00:34:30.668
NECESSARILY SAY IN THE REPORT

00:34:30.735 --> 00:34:31.769
THAT THESE AREN'T EVENTS THAT

00:34:31.836 --> 00:34:34.439
WERE BENEFICIAL TO VETERANS.

00:34:34.505 --> 00:34:36.574
OUR CONCERN IS REALLY MAKING

00:34:36.641 --> 00:34:38.376
SURE THAT THE STATE IS PROPERLY

00:34:38.443 --> 00:34:40.645
NEGOTIATING WITH A PARTICULAR

00:34:40.711 --> 00:34:42.580
ENTITIES ENTER ENTER IT TO THE

00:34:42.647 --> 00:34:44.982
APPROPRIATE TYPES OF AGREEMENTS --

00:34:45.049 --> 00:34:46.484
TO PROTECT THE STATE ASSURE THAT

00:34:46.551 --> 00:34:47.518
THE STATE GETS --

00:34:47.585 --> 00:34:48.953
YOU KNOW THE ASSOCIATED VALUE

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:50.221
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THAT MONEY

00:34:50.288 --> 00:34:52.690
GOES INTO THE HOMES AND AGAIN IS

00:34:52.757 --> 00:34:54.091
FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE VETERANS

00:34:54.158 --> 00:34:55.526
EITHER IN THE GENERAL FUND TO

00:34:55.593 --> 00:34:57.261
BENEFIT THE HOMES IN GENERAL OR

00:34:57.328 --> 00:34:58.496
AT A SPECIFIC HOME LIKE YOU

00:34:58.563 --> 00:34:59.864
DON'T BILL WHERE IT WOULD GO

00:34:59.931 --> 00:35:00.932
INTO THE MORALE FUND.

00:35:00.998 --> 00:35:04.001
THAT DIRECTLY BENEFITS --

00:35:04.068 --> 00:35:04.569
VETERANS.

00:35:04.635 --> 00:35:05.369
SO LET ME START WITH THE FIRST

00:35:05.436 --> 00:35:06.571
ISSUE -- AND

00:35:06.637 --> 00:35:08.739
THIS IS RELATED TO AGREEMENTS

00:35:08.806 --> 00:35:10.908
THAT CALVET INDEED YES ENTERED

00:35:10.975 --> 00:35:12.944
INTO THE LEASES --

00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:15.146
AND I AS OUR TITLE SAYS CALVET

00:35:15.213 --> 00:35:15.980
INDEED YES ESTABLISHED

00:35:16.047 --> 00:35:17.248
AGREEMENTS THAT WERE OF

00:35:17.315 --> 00:35:19.250
QUESTIONABLE BENEFIT AS YOU SAID

00:35:19.317 --> 00:35:20.952
MISTER CHAIRMAN AND AND I THINK

00:35:21.018 --> 00:35:22.153
MS OR ONE SPOKE ABOUT IT IS.

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:25.723
DTS HAS THE AUTHORITY TO THE

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:27.225
PERMISSION OF CAL THAT

00:35:27.291 --> 00:35:29.060
PARTICULAR RELATED TO TO

00:35:29.126 --> 00:35:29.927
PROPERTIES AT THE PARTICULAR

00:35:29.994 --> 00:35:31.295
HOMES BUT WHAT THE STATE LAW

00:35:31.362 --> 00:35:33.297
SPECIFICALLY REQUIRES IS THAT.

00:35:33.364 --> 00:35:35.266
THE DECISION HAS TO BE BASED ON

00:35:35.333 --> 00:35:36.667
IS THIS LEAST IN THE BEST

00:35:36.734 --> 00:35:38.169
INTEREST OF THE HOME.

00:35:38.236 --> 00:35:39.570
AND WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT THE

00:35:39.637 --> 00:35:40.872
LEASES AND WE WERE ASKING

00:35:40.938 --> 00:35:42.507
QUESTIONS OF BOTH CALVET INDEED

00:35:42.573 --> 00:35:43.641
YES.

00:35:43.708 --> 00:35:44.442
NEITHER OF THEM COULD REALLY

00:35:44.509 --> 00:35:46.711
SHOW US ANY SPECIFIC CRITERIA

00:35:46.777 --> 00:35:48.946
THAT THEY USED TO DETERMINE THAT

00:35:49.013 --> 00:35:50.548
THIS PARTICULAR LEASE --

00:35:50.615 --> 00:35:52.183
THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT WAS IN

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:53.584
THE BEST INTEREST OF THE HOME.

00:35:53.651 --> 00:35:55.319
SO WE HAD CONCERNS WITH RESPECT

00:35:55.386 --> 00:35:56.721
TO THAT.

00:35:56.787 --> 00:35:58.389
NOW ONE THING THAT YOU'LL HEAR A

00:35:58.456 --> 00:35:59.957
THEME THROUGH PART OF MY

00:36:00.024 --> 00:36:01.592
PRESENTATION CERTAINLY AMANDA'S

00:36:01.659 --> 00:36:03.594
IS -- THE

00:36:03.661 --> 00:36:05.596
THE VETERANS AFFAIRS SECRETARY

00:36:05.663 --> 00:36:06.531
AND THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS

00:36:06.597 --> 00:36:08.432
AFFAIRS WAS VERY RESPONSIVE VERY

00:36:08.499 --> 00:36:09.567
EASY TO WORK WITH DURING THE

00:36:09.634 --> 00:36:10.735
COURSE OF THIS AUDIT.

00:36:10.801 --> 00:36:12.370
THAT IS NOT TYPICAL WHEN WE WHEN

00:36:12.436 --> 00:36:14.005
WE ARE OUT CONDUCTING AUDITS SO

00:36:14.071 --> 00:36:16.040
THEY ACTUALLY TOOK SOME

00:36:16.107 --> 00:36:17.375
CORRECTIVE ACTION.

00:36:17.441 --> 00:36:18.676
WHILE WE WERE CONDUCTING THE

00:36:18.743 --> 00:36:20.578
WORK AS WE WOULD BRING ISSUES TO

00:36:20.645 --> 00:36:22.146
THEIR ATTENTION THEY WOULD TRY

00:36:22.213 --> 00:36:23.080
TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES

00:36:23.147 --> 00:36:24.448
IMMEDIATELY.

00:36:24.515 --> 00:36:26.317
AND WITH RESPECT --

00:36:26.384 --> 00:36:27.952
TO THE THE DISCUSSION I JUST HAD

00:36:28.019 --> 00:36:28.786
AS FAR AS THE BEST INTERESTS OF

00:36:28.853 --> 00:36:30.154
THE HOME WE WERE STILL

00:36:30.221 --> 00:36:31.389
CONDUCTING ON IT WORK WE DIDN'T

00:36:31.455 --> 00:36:33.157
ISSUE THIS AUDIT UNTIL JANUARY

00:36:33.224 --> 00:36:34.325
OF THIS YEAR.

00:36:34.392 --> 00:36:35.993
BUT CALVET ACTUALLY DISTRIBUTED

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:37.295
A MEMO TO ALL THEIR HOME

00:36:37.361 --> 00:36:40.164

00:36:44.268 --> 00:36:45.736
APPROPRIATE CRITERIA FOR BEST

00:36:45.803 --> 00:36:47.071
INTEREST OF THE HOME.

00:36:47.138 --> 00:36:48.639
WE STILL HAVE A RECOMMENDATION

00:36:48.706 --> 00:36:51.208
RELATED TO THAT IT'S TO WORK

00:36:51.275 --> 00:36:53.778
WITH THE GS SINCE TGS ULTIMATELY

00:36:53.844 --> 00:36:55.279
APPROVES LEASES.

00:36:55.346 --> 00:36:57.114
THEY NEED TO AGREE ON WHAT THAT

00:36:57.181 --> 00:36:58.549
CRITERIA SHOULD BE SO

00:36:58.616 --> 00:37:00.151
ESSENTIALLY CAL THAT HAS TAKEN A

00:37:00.217 --> 00:37:02.219
STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WE

00:37:02.286 --> 00:37:03.654
JUST WANT TO SEE FURTHER.

00:37:03.721 --> 00:37:05.856
DISCUSSIONS AND FINALIZING THAT

00:37:05.923 --> 00:37:08.192
PARTICULAR WORK --

00:37:08.259 --> 00:37:09.760
WE ALSO SAW A SECOND ISSUE

00:37:09.827 --> 00:37:11.562
RELATED TO LEASES IS THE TERMS

00:37:11.629 --> 00:37:12.630
OF THE LEASES.

00:37:12.697 --> 00:37:14.599
GENERALLY A STATE LAW REQUIRES A

00:37:14.665 --> 00:37:17.501
LEASE TO NOT EXCEED FIVE YEARS --

00:37:17.568 --> 00:37:19.470
BUT MANY OF THESE LEASES WERE

00:37:19.537 --> 00:37:22.273
FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:23.140
THIRTY FORTY FIFTY YEARS --

00:37:23.207 --> 00:37:25.343
IN SOME INSTANCES ALSO WHEN WE

00:37:25.409 --> 00:37:27.278
WERE LOOKING AT THE LANGUAGE IN

00:37:27.345 --> 00:37:29.380
THE LEASES WE HAVE ATTORNEYS --

00:37:29.447 --> 00:37:30.915
WORK WITH ALL OF OUR STAFF.

00:37:30.982 --> 00:37:32.750
THE LEASE TERMS DID NOT ALLOW

00:37:32.817 --> 00:37:35.486
THE STATE TO TERMINATE THE LEASE

00:37:35.553 --> 00:37:36.587
ON AT ITS DISCRETION AND

00:37:36.654 --> 00:37:37.788
TYPICALLY THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE

00:37:37.855 --> 00:37:39.056
IN A CONTRACT TO RELEASE THE

00:37:39.123 --> 00:37:40.458
STATE SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO

00:37:40.524 --> 00:37:41.392
SAY WE WANT TO TERMINATE THIS

00:37:41.459 --> 00:37:43.027
LEASE WE WANT TO GET OUT OF IT.

00:37:43.094 --> 00:37:44.328
THE TERMINATION LANGUAGE THAT WE

00:37:44.395 --> 00:37:45.863
SIGNED THE LEASE IS REALLY ONLY

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:47.198
COULD HAPPEN.

00:37:47.264 --> 00:37:48.833
IF THERE WAS A BREACH OF THE

00:37:48.899 --> 00:37:51.802
LEASE TERMS SO WE FELT THAT THE

00:37:51.869 --> 00:37:53.104
THE DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:55.239
AND CAL THAT NEED TO TAKE A LOOK

00:37:55.306 --> 00:37:55.873
AT SOME OF THOSE TERMS IN THOSE

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:57.608
LEASES. TO REALLY STRENGTHEN THE

00:37:57.675 --> 00:37:59.810
STATE'S POSITION WITH RESPECT TO

00:37:59.877 --> 00:38:00.678
THAT.

00:38:00.745 --> 00:38:02.279
WE IDENTIFIED ONE LEAST THAT HAD

00:38:02.346 --> 00:38:04.582
NOT BEEN APPROVED BY DE GS.

00:38:04.649 --> 00:38:06.050
AND BASED ON STATE LAW THAT

00:38:06.117 --> 00:38:07.818
LEASES ESSENTIALLY VOID OR

00:38:07.885 --> 00:38:09.053
VOIDABLE SO WE HAVEA

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.955
RECOMMENDATION TO DG ASKING CAL

00:38:11.022 --> 00:38:12.890
THAT. TO WORK THIS IS A LEASE

00:38:12.957 --> 00:38:14.091
RELATED TO THE SWIMMING POOL

00:38:14.158 --> 00:38:15.826
WITH THE TOWN --

00:38:15.893 --> 00:38:17.962
AND SO WE NEED THE STATE NEEDS

00:38:18.029 --> 00:38:19.597
TO CAL THAT DID YES NEEDS TO

00:38:19.664 --> 00:38:21.465
WORK WITH THE TOWN TO DETERMINE

00:38:21.532 --> 00:38:22.933
WHETHER OR NOT THEY DO WANT TO

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.301
ENTER INTO A LEASE CONTINUED UP

00:38:24.368 --> 00:38:25.302
THE POLE FUNCTIONING BECAUSE

00:38:25.369 --> 00:38:27.705
IT'S A BENEFIT. TO TO THE

00:38:27.772 --> 00:38:28.039
COMMUNITY --

00:38:28.105 --> 00:38:31.442
BUT THERE NEEDS TO THAT IS --

00:38:31.509 --> 00:38:32.843
THE THE TERMS ARE DISCUSSED

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:34.245
AGREED UPON AND ESSENTIALLY

00:38:34.311 --> 00:38:36.580
APPROVED BY TGS SO WHERE

00:38:36.647 --> 00:38:38.983
RECOMMENDATION RELATED TO THAT.

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:40.284
NOW THE OTHER LEASES THAT WE

00:38:40.351 --> 00:38:42.253
LOOK AT WERE HOUSING --

00:38:42.319 --> 00:38:44.488
AND MANY STATE AGENCIES PROVIDE

00:38:44.555 --> 00:38:45.823
EMPLOYEE HOUSING.

00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:47.091
AND WHEN WE LOOKED AT THESE

00:38:47.158 --> 00:38:49.593
LEASES FOR EMPLOYEES --

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:51.796
TO TO HAVE HOUSING ON ON THERE

00:38:51.862 --> 00:38:52.496
YOU DON'T FEEL CAMPUS IN

00:38:52.563 --> 00:38:54.031
PARTICULAR --

00:38:54.098 --> 00:38:55.866
THAT AGAIN THEY LACKED THOSE KEY

00:38:55.933 --> 00:38:57.435
TERMS TO PROTECT THE STATE'S

00:38:57.501 --> 00:38:59.403
INTEREST THEY HAD THE DEVELOPED

00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:01.005
REQUIREMENTS FOR LEASES BUT THEY

00:39:01.072 --> 00:39:02.339
DIDN'T INCLUDE CERTAIN TERMS AND

00:39:02.406 --> 00:39:03.374
CONDITIONS.

00:39:03.441 --> 00:39:05.509
IN ALL OF THE AGREEMENTS WE SAW

00:39:05.576 --> 00:39:08.112
INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THE

00:39:08.179 --> 00:39:09.714
VARIOUS LEASES WITH --

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:11.649
INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES --

00:39:11.716 --> 00:39:13.117
THEY ALSO DIDN'T PROTECT THE

00:39:13.184 --> 00:39:15.619
STATE AGAINST LIABILITY --

00:39:15.686 --> 00:39:17.221
AND SHIELDING THE STATE SO AGAIN

00:39:17.288 --> 00:39:20.491
SIMILAR TO THE LEASES --

00:39:20.558 --> 00:39:22.860
FOR SOME OF THE OTHER --

00:39:22.927 --> 00:39:23.427
ENTITIES LIKE THE MUSEUM THE

00:39:23.494 --> 00:39:24.762
THEATER AT CETERA THESE EMPLOYEE

00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:27.198
LEASES THE TERMS DID NOT HAVE.

00:39:27.264 --> 00:39:29.300
THE APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE TO

00:39:29.366 --> 00:39:31.135
REALLY PROTECT THE STATE SO WE

00:39:31.202 --> 00:39:32.870
FELT THAT CAL THAT NEEDED TO DO

00:39:32.937 --> 00:39:35.106
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT AGAIN THIS

00:39:35.172 --> 00:39:36.407
WAS EVEN PRIOR TO THE AUDIT.

00:39:36.474 --> 00:39:39.210
BECAUSE THE AGENCY WANTS THE WAS

00:39:39.276 --> 00:39:39.810
APPROVED REALLY KIND OF JUMPED

00:39:39.877 --> 00:39:42.747
ON PARTICULAR ISSUES AND WANTED

00:39:42.813 --> 00:39:44.448
TO HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING SO AS

00:39:44.515 --> 00:39:46.317
WE SAY IN THE REPORT --

00:39:46.383 --> 00:39:48.219
AS EARLY AS MAY OF TWENTY

00:39:48.285 --> 00:39:48.986
EIGHTEEN CALVET ISSUED A

00:39:49.053 --> 00:39:49.820
DIRECTIVE TO THE HOME

00:39:49.887 --> 00:39:51.388
ADMINISTRATOR STATE SAYING THAT

00:39:51.455 --> 00:39:52.690
HEADQUARTERS WAS GOING TO TAKE

00:39:52.757 --> 00:39:53.624
CONTROL.

00:39:53.691 --> 00:39:55.626
OF APPROVING EMPLOYEE HOUSING

00:39:55.693 --> 00:39:56.861
LEASES --

00:39:56.927 --> 00:39:57.862
BECAUSE THERE WAS SO MUCH

00:39:57.928 --> 00:39:59.730
INCONSISTENCY HUG HEADQUARTERS

00:39:59.797 --> 00:40:00.831
FELT THEY WANTED TO TAKE THAT

00:40:00.898 --> 00:40:02.900
RESPONSIBILITY AT HEADQUARTERS

00:40:02.967 --> 00:40:04.135
SO THEY COULD CONTROL IT --

00:40:04.201 --> 00:40:05.703
AND BE IN CHARGE OF THAT THEY

00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:06.771
ALSO.

00:40:06.837 --> 00:40:09.607
ADOPTED A POLICY IN NOVEMBER OF

00:40:09.673 --> 00:40:10.441
TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND AGAIN THIS

00:40:10.508 --> 00:40:12.109
IS DISCUSSED IN THE REPORT.

00:40:12.176 --> 00:40:14.311
THAT CAL VETS POLICY WITH

00:40:14.378 --> 00:40:16.080
RESPECT EMPLOYEE HOUSING WILL

00:40:16.147 --> 00:40:18.382
MIRROR WHAT CAL HR OUR STATE

00:40:18.449 --> 00:40:21.118
AGENCY HAS RESPONSIBILITY.

00:40:21.185 --> 00:40:23.053
FOR HOUSING ARRANGEMENTS AND AND

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.355
UNDERSTANDING HOW THOSE

00:40:24.421 --> 00:40:25.489
ARRANGEMENTS SHOULD BE PUT

00:40:25.556 --> 00:40:27.124
TOGETHER AND WHAT THE STATE

00:40:27.191 --> 00:40:29.827
AGENCY SHOULD BE DOING --

00:40:29.894 --> 00:40:31.662
CAL THAT AB ESSENTIALLY ADOPTED

00:40:31.729 --> 00:40:33.230
KELLY CHARGE POLICY SO AGAIN

00:40:33.297 --> 00:40:35.733
TAKING SOME OF CORRECTIVE ACTION

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:38.702
DURING THE COURSE OF THE AUDIT

00:40:38.769 --> 00:40:39.203
WITH THAT WHILE WE WERE

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:39.837
CONDUCTING IT.

00:40:39.904 --> 00:40:40.504
AND THEN THE LAST ISSUE IN THIS

00:40:40.571 --> 00:40:41.338
PARTICULAR AREA IS REALLY WE

00:40:41.405 --> 00:40:43.073
FELT THAT CALVET NEEDED STRONGER

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:44.608
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THEY

00:40:44.675 --> 00:40:46.844
REALLY DIDN'T HAVE ANY STRUCTURE.

00:40:46.911 --> 00:40:48.312
AS FAR AS GUIDANCE FOR THE

00:40:48.379 --> 00:40:49.747
INDIVIDUAL --

00:40:49.814 --> 00:40:50.514
ADMINISTER YOURSELF TO VARIOUS

00:40:50.581 --> 00:40:52.416
HOMES SO WE HAVE SOME

00:40:52.483 --> 00:40:54.151
RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO THAT

00:40:54.218 --> 00:40:55.586
AND AGAIN CAL THAT IS WHAT WAS

00:40:55.653 --> 00:40:57.188
WORKING ON AND PUBLISH SOME

00:40:57.254 --> 00:40:59.356
POLICIES IN DECEMBER OF EIGHTEEN

00:40:59.423 --> 00:41:00.457
SO OUR RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE

00:41:00.524 --> 00:41:01.759
REPORT ARE YOU'VE GOTTEN A GOOD

00:41:01.826 --> 00:41:03.594
START ON THIS.

00:41:03.661 --> 00:41:05.196
YOU NEED TO CONTINUE --

00:41:05.262 --> 00:41:06.230
TO FINALIZE YOUR POLICIES BUT

00:41:06.297 --> 00:41:09.433
THEN ALL ISMS TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:10.835
THOSE POLICIES ARE BEING

00:41:10.901 --> 00:41:12.303
ENFORCED.

00:41:12.369 --> 00:41:15.005
SO THAT WAS OUR FIRST SECTION --

00:41:15.072 --> 00:41:16.707
UP THE AUDIT REPORT AND I KNOW

00:41:16.774 --> 00:41:18.342
ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN HAS A BILL

00:41:18.409 --> 00:41:21.278
RELATED TO THE FIVE YEAR WINDOW --

00:41:21.345 --> 00:41:22.513
AS FAR AS THE STATURE BECAUSE WE

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:23.747
MADE A LEGISLATIVE

00:41:23.814 --> 00:41:25.382
RECOMMENDATION AND I UNDERSTAND --

00:41:25.449 --> 00:41:26.717
AB -- TWO

00:41:26.784 --> 00:41:28.118
FORTY BY MS OR WHEN IS IS

00:41:28.185 --> 00:41:29.620
ADDRESSING THAT PARTICULAR

00:41:29.687 --> 00:41:30.921
SITUATION.

00:41:30.988 --> 00:41:32.256
NOW THE SECOND ISSUE THAT I'M

00:41:32.323 --> 00:41:33.757
GOING TO GO OVER IS RELATED TO

00:41:33.824 --> 00:41:35.159
COLLECTION OF RENTAL.

00:41:35.226 --> 00:41:37.294
FEES AND PAYMENTS SO WHEN WE

00:41:37.361 --> 00:41:39.897
TALKED TO DJ YES WE ASK TGS HOW

00:41:39.964 --> 00:41:41.699
DID YOU DETERMINE WHAT THE

00:41:41.765 --> 00:41:43.801
RENTAL RATE WOULD BE FOR THESE

00:41:43.868 --> 00:41:45.236
PARTICULAR FACILITIES THEIR

00:41:45.302 --> 00:41:46.103
REQUIRED.

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:48.339
BY STATE LAW TO MAKE SURE A

00:41:48.405 --> 00:41:50.107
RENTAL RATES ARE AT MARKET VALUE --

00:41:50.174 --> 00:41:51.809
INDEED YES HAD A VERY DIFFICULT

00:41:51.876 --> 00:41:53.844
TIME IN SHOWING US EVIDENCE THAT

00:41:53.911 --> 00:41:55.713
THEY REALLY DETERMINED THAT THE

00:41:55.779 --> 00:41:57.314
RENTS THAT WERE BEING CHARGED.

00:41:57.381 --> 00:41:59.216
TO VARIOUS FACILITIES WERE

00:41:59.283 --> 00:42:00.651
REALLY AT MARKET RATE --

00:42:00.718 --> 00:42:03.520
SO AGAIN WE HAD A RECOMMENDATION --

00:42:03.587 --> 00:42:05.189
TO DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES

00:42:05.256 --> 00:42:06.457
THERE ARE ALSO PROVISIONS THAT

00:42:06.523 --> 00:42:08.092
ALLOW AN ENTITY IF AN ENTITY

00:42:08.158 --> 00:42:11.662
PROVIDE SERVICES OR I'M SOME

00:42:11.729 --> 00:42:12.696
OTHER IMPROVEMENTS TO A PROPERTY

00:42:12.763 --> 00:42:14.265
THAT SHOULD BE REFLECTED IN THE

00:42:14.331 --> 00:42:15.966
RENTAL RATES SO THE RENTAL RATE

00:42:16.033 --> 00:42:16.166
MAKE.

00:42:16.233 --> 00:42:18.068
THE MARKET RATE MAY BE A CERTAIN

00:42:18.135 --> 00:42:20.037
AMOUNT BUT IT'S REDUCED BY DID

00:42:20.104 --> 00:42:21.572
YES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE

00:42:21.639 --> 00:42:22.940
ENTITY THAT'S RENTING THAT

00:42:23.007 --> 00:42:24.575
PARTICULAR FACILITY.

00:42:24.642 --> 00:42:27.811
FROM CAL THAT OR A PARTICULAR

00:42:27.878 --> 00:42:29.113
THAT'S ACKNOWLEDGED AS PART OF

00:42:29.179 --> 00:42:31.048
THE CALCULATION BUT AGAIN WE

00:42:31.115 --> 00:42:32.483
DIDN'T SEE ANY EVIDENCE OF THAT

00:42:32.549 --> 00:42:34.351
SO WE REALLY FELT THE TGS NEEDS

00:42:34.418 --> 00:42:35.486
TO DO A BETTER JOB.

00:42:35.552 --> 00:42:36.787
OF MAKING SURE THAT IT CAN

00:42:36.854 --> 00:42:38.255
DEFEND --

00:42:38.322 --> 00:42:39.490
WHAT RATES?

00:42:39.556 --> 00:42:41.058
THEY ARE DETERMINING ARE THE

00:42:41.125 --> 00:42:43.494
APPROPRIATE RATES FOR THESE

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:46.430
PARTICULAR FACILITIES --

00:42:46.497 --> 00:42:48.232
THE MISTER CHAIRMAN YOU TALKED A

00:42:48.299 --> 00:42:49.533
LITTLE BIT ABOUT LOOKING AT

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:51.502
PROCEEDS SO --

00:42:51.568 --> 00:42:53.904
STATE LAW REQUIRES THAT PROCEEDS

00:42:53.971 --> 00:42:55.239
FROM LEASES A VETERANS HOMES BE

00:42:55.306 --> 00:42:57.508
DEPOSITED INTO THE GENERAL FUND

00:42:57.574 --> 00:43:00.044
AND THEN THAT AUGMENT THAT IS IS

00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:02.713
A IT'S DONE BY CAL VET BUT THEN

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:04.381
CAL THAT HAS RESPONSIBILITY TO

00:43:04.448 --> 00:43:05.616
NOTIFY THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE

00:43:05.683 --> 00:43:06.917
AND CERTAINLY THE LEGISLATURE

00:43:06.984 --> 00:43:08.118
BECAUSE THE WAY THE STATE LAW

00:43:08.185 --> 00:43:08.352
READS.

00:43:08.419 --> 00:43:11.121
RIGHT NOW IS ANY FUNDS COLLECTED

00:43:11.188 --> 00:43:13.490
FROM THESE LEASES GOING TO THE

00:43:13.557 --> 00:43:15.559
GENERAL FUND BUT THAT SHOULD --

00:43:15.626 --> 00:43:17.461
ALSO HE'S RESULT IN AN

00:43:17.528 --> 00:43:18.796
AUGMENTATION --

00:43:18.862 --> 00:43:21.265
TO THE APPROPRIATION FOR CALVET.

00:43:21.332 --> 00:43:22.499
BUT THAT'S THE PART THAT WASN'T

00:43:22.566 --> 00:43:24.101
HAPPENING CALVET WAS COLLECTING

00:43:24.168 --> 00:43:27.371
THE FUNDS THEY COLLECT ABOUT.

00:43:27.438 --> 00:43:27.972
THREE HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND

00:43:28.038 --> 00:43:29.139
TGS COLLECTED --

00:43:29.206 --> 00:43:31.742
A LITTLE OVER A HUNDRED EIGHTEEN

00:43:31.809 --> 00:43:32.843
THOUSAND A TGS INAPPROPRIATELY

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:34.445
DEPOSIT THOSE FUNDS IN THE WRONG

00:43:34.511 --> 00:43:35.713
ACCOUNT THEY DID NOT DEPOSIT

00:43:35.779 --> 00:43:37.448
THEM IN THE GENERAL FUND SO WE

00:43:37.514 --> 00:43:38.115
HAVE A RECOMMENDATION RELATED TO

00:43:38.182 --> 00:43:38.849
THAT.

00:43:38.916 --> 00:43:40.784
THAT MONEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN

00:43:40.851 --> 00:43:43.320
APPROPRIATED TO THE GENERAL FUND

00:43:43.387 --> 00:43:44.722
AND IF CAL THAT HAD PROPERLY

00:43:44.788 --> 00:43:46.523
NOTIFIED FINANCE IN THE

00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:48.125
LEGISLATURE THAN THE LEGISLATURE

00:43:48.192 --> 00:43:49.326
COULD HAVE TAKEN ACTION IN AN

00:43:49.393 --> 00:43:50.828
AUGMENTED THE APPROPRIATION.

00:43:50.894 --> 00:43:52.529
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

00:43:52.596 --> 00:43:53.998
SO WE HAVE OBVIOUSLY

00:43:54.064 --> 00:43:55.632
RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO THAT

00:43:55.699 --> 00:44:00.104
NOW THERE ARE SOME ENTITIES ON A

00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:01.572
A HOME -- AT

00:44:01.638 --> 00:44:03.140
K. AT A YOUNG FILL FOR EXAMPLE

00:44:03.207 --> 00:44:04.241
THERE'S A CONVENIENCE STORE

00:44:04.308 --> 00:44:05.476
THERE'S A GOLF COURSE THE WAY

00:44:05.542 --> 00:44:07.177
THE LEASES WORK FOR THOSE

00:44:07.244 --> 00:44:09.013
PARTICULAR ENTITIES --

00:44:09.079 --> 00:44:10.581
THERE'S A PERCENTAGE OF THEIR

00:44:10.647 --> 00:44:11.882
SALES ESSENTIALLY THE

00:44:11.949 --> 00:44:13.684
CONVENIENCE STORE OR THE GOLF

00:44:13.751 --> 00:44:16.053
COURSE THE PERCENTAGE OF SALES

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:17.388
SHOULD BE GOING TO CAL THAT --

00:44:17.454 --> 00:44:18.956
WHAT WE FOUND WHEN WE STARTED

00:44:19.023 --> 00:44:20.290
LOOKING AT THE RECEIPTS AND WHAT

00:44:20.357 --> 00:44:21.892
CAL THAT WAS DOING TO MONITOR TO

00:44:21.959 --> 00:44:23.227
MAKE SURE IT WAS CAPTURING A

00:44:23.293 --> 00:44:24.695
RECEIVING ALL THE REVENUE IT WAS

00:44:24.762 --> 00:44:25.462
DO?

00:44:25.529 --> 00:44:28.065
WE FOUND IT WAS SHORT --

00:44:28.132 --> 00:44:30.167
THOSE TWO ENTITIES HAD NOT.

00:44:30.234 --> 00:44:31.869
PAID OVER OVER A HUNDRED

00:44:31.935 --> 00:44:34.071
THOUSAND DOLLARS IN FEES TO

00:44:34.138 --> 00:44:35.439
BASED ON THE PERCENTAGE TO CAL

00:44:35.506 --> 00:44:37.908
THAT AGAIN THESE FUNDS WOULD GO

00:44:37.975 --> 00:44:40.044
INTO THE MORALE FUN SO AGAIN

00:44:40.110 --> 00:44:41.478
THIS IS A HIT ON THE VETERANS.

00:44:41.545 --> 00:44:43.247
SO CALVET NEEDS TO DO A BETTER

00:44:43.313 --> 00:44:45.382
JOB OF MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE

00:44:45.449 --> 00:44:46.683
MONITORING --

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:48.552
WHAT THEY ARE ENTITLED TO

00:44:48.619 --> 00:44:50.320
RECEIVE FROM ENTITIES LIKE THE

00:44:50.387 --> 00:44:51.422
CONVENIENCE STORE OR THE GOLF

00:44:51.488 --> 00:44:55.059
COURSE SO WE HAVE

00:44:55.125 --> 00:44:56.193
RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO THAT?

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:58.128
AND THEN THE LAST PIECE RELATED

00:44:58.195 --> 00:44:59.229
TO FEES IS TIED TO EMPLOYEE

00:44:59.296 --> 00:45:00.898
HOUSING.

00:45:00.964 --> 00:45:02.866
AS I SAID THEY THAT CAL THAT AT

00:45:02.933 --> 00:45:04.068
THAT POINT HAD NOT.

00:45:04.134 --> 00:45:05.702
DEVELOPED THE POLICY THAT WAS

00:45:05.769 --> 00:45:07.237
SIMILAR TO CALLIE CHARGE POLICY

00:45:07.304 --> 00:45:09.106
WHAT CAL HR REQUIRES STATE

00:45:09.173 --> 00:45:10.674
AGENCIES THAT PROVIDE EMPLOYEE

00:45:10.741 --> 00:45:12.009
HOUSING TO DO.

00:45:12.076 --> 00:45:13.710
IS HAVE THOSE AGENCIES MAKE SURE

00:45:13.777 --> 00:45:16.814
THEY'RE RENTING THE FACILITIES

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:18.649
THE HOMES AT FAIR MARKET --

00:45:18.715 --> 00:45:21.985
AND TO AT LEAST REVIEW ALL OF

00:45:22.052 --> 00:45:23.720
THE THE EMPLOYEE HOUSING LEASES

00:45:23.787 --> 00:45:27.624
EVERY SURE THERE AT MARKET WHAT

00:45:27.691 --> 00:45:30.360
CAL HR SUGGESTS IS DO 20% OF THE

00:45:30.427 --> 00:45:31.328
ASSESSMENTS.

00:45:31.395 --> 00:45:33.163
AND WHEN YOU HIT A FIVE YEAR

00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:33.797
WINDOW YOU'VE HAD EVERY SINGLE

00:45:33.864 --> 00:45:34.798
HOME -- CAL

00:45:34.865 --> 00:45:36.667
THAT WASN'T DOING THAT SO WHEN

00:45:36.733 --> 00:45:38.802
WE LOOKED AT THE EMPLOYEE

00:45:38.869 --> 00:45:41.138
HOUSING RATES AND COMPARE IT TO

00:45:41.205 --> 00:45:43.173
FAIR MARKET ON AVERAGE THEY WERE

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:44.775
ALMOST A 100% BELOW.

00:45:44.842 --> 00:45:45.909
MARKET RATE SO THEY WERE

00:45:45.976 --> 00:45:47.778
SIGNIFICANTLY SHORT WE ACT WE

00:45:47.845 --> 00:45:49.780
CALCULATED ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY

00:45:49.847 --> 00:45:51.415
TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS JUST FOR

00:45:51.482 --> 00:45:52.883
FIFTEEN HOMES THERE FIFTEEN

00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:54.618
HOMES THAT WERE OCCUPIED.

00:45:54.685 --> 00:45:57.020
BY EMPLOYEES WHERE THIS THE CAL

00:45:57.087 --> 00:45:58.489
THAT HAD NOT BEEN RECEIVING --

00:45:58.555 --> 00:46:01.225
THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF RENT

00:46:01.291 --> 00:46:02.726
IF IT WAS AT MARKET RATES.

00:46:02.793 --> 00:46:04.328
NOW WHAT CALVET CAN DO --

00:46:04.394 --> 00:46:06.029
THERE IS A LIMIT THEY CAN'T ALL

00:46:06.096 --> 00:46:06.964
OF A SUDDEN INCREASE ALL OF

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:08.866
THOSE RENTS A 100%.

00:46:08.932 --> 00:46:10.234
THERE ARE.

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:12.136
LIMITS AS TO WHAT IS AN AGENCY

00:46:12.202 --> 00:46:13.570
CAN DO IF THEY WANT TO INCREASE

00:46:13.637 --> 00:46:15.839
RENT THEY CAN ONLY INCREASE AT

00:46:15.906 --> 00:46:16.240
25%.

00:46:16.306 --> 00:46:18.175
A YEAR -- SO

00:46:18.242 --> 00:46:19.977
THERE THERE WILL BE SOME TIME

00:46:20.043 --> 00:46:21.345
FOR THEM TO CATCH UP NOW IF ANY

00:46:21.411 --> 00:46:23.013
OF THOSE HOMES ARE VACATED BY AN

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:24.548
EMPLOYEE IN A NEW PLAN PLOY HE

00:46:24.615 --> 00:46:25.649
COMES IN AND THEN THEY CAN

00:46:25.716 --> 00:46:28.886
RECTIFY AND GET TO MARKET RATE --

00:46:28.952 --> 00:46:31.488
BUT AGAIN THEY THEY WERE AS

00:46:31.555 --> 00:46:32.856
HOMES AS FAR AS THE AMOUNT THEY

00:46:32.923 --> 00:46:34.158
WERE --

00:46:34.224 --> 00:46:35.926
REQUIRING EMPLOYEES TO PAY.

00:46:35.993 --> 00:46:37.127
THE OTHER ISSUE THAT WE

00:46:37.194 --> 00:46:38.629
IDENTIFIED RELATED TO THAT IS

00:46:38.695 --> 00:46:40.264
THAT'S A FRINGE BENEFIT SO THOSE

00:46:40.330 --> 00:46:41.298
EMPTY THE THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD

00:46:41.365 --> 00:46:43.200
BE REPORTING THAT INFORMATION TO

00:46:43.267 --> 00:46:44.568
THE IRS BECAUSE YOU PAY TAXES ON

00:46:44.635 --> 00:46:45.802
THAT -- SO

00:46:45.869 --> 00:46:47.037
WE HAD A VARIETY OF

00:46:47.104 --> 00:46:50.007
RECOMMENDATIONS --

00:46:50.073 --> 00:46:51.508
RELATED TO THIS PARTICULAR

00:46:51.575 --> 00:46:53.243
SECTION OF THE REPORT REALLY

00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:55.846
TALKING ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT.

00:46:55.913 --> 00:46:57.548
SEEKING THE AUGMENTATION NOW

00:46:57.614 --> 00:46:58.715
WHAT YOU WILL HEAR AND WE

00:46:58.782 --> 00:47:00.083
DISCUSSED IN THE REPORT WE TALK

00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:01.318
TO THE DEPARTMENTS ABOUT

00:47:01.385 --> 00:47:02.786
PARTICULARLY CAL THAT IS.

00:47:02.853 --> 00:47:04.888
THEIR THEIR PERSPECTIVE ON THE

00:47:04.955 --> 00:47:07.024
STATUTE THAT REQUIRES THEM TO

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:08.559
COME TO THE LEGISLATURE AND

00:47:08.625 --> 00:47:09.927
FINANCE TO GET AN AUGMENTATION

00:47:09.993 --> 00:47:11.695
THEY BELIEVE THAT'S OUT OBSOLETE

00:47:11.762 --> 00:47:13.931
AND OUTDATED AND PERHAPS IT IS.

00:47:13.997 --> 00:47:15.199
BUT IT'S STILL ON THE BOOKS SO

00:47:15.265 --> 00:47:16.800
THAT'S WHAT WE SAID TO THEM IS

00:47:16.867 --> 00:47:20.137
IF YOU FEEL THAT THE STATUTE --

00:47:20.204 --> 00:47:21.238
IS THE APPROPRIATE STATUTE AND

00:47:21.305 --> 00:47:22.573
SEEK THE AUGMENTATION IF YOU

00:47:22.639 --> 00:47:24.041
FEEL IT IT IS OUTDATED AND

00:47:24.107 --> 00:47:25.609
OBSOLETE THEN WE'VE GOT TO GET A

00:47:25.676 --> 00:47:27.377
MODIFICATION TO THAT STATUTE GET

00:47:27.444 --> 00:47:28.979
IT EITHER OFF THE YOU KNOW OFF

00:47:29.046 --> 00:47:30.881
THE BOOKS OR MODIFIED IN AN

00:47:30.948 --> 00:47:32.182
APPROPRIATE MANNER --

00:47:32.249 --> 00:47:36.486
SO IT REFLECTS REALITY OF WHAT'S

00:47:36.553 --> 00:47:36.753
HAPPENING.

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:37.387
TODAY.

00:47:37.454 --> 00:47:38.055
AND THEN THE OTHER ISSUES REALLY

00:47:38.121 --> 00:47:39.122
ARE JUST MAKING SURE YOU'RE

00:47:39.189 --> 00:47:40.324
TRACKING COMPLIANCE WITH

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:43.393
PAYMENTS WITH RESPECT TO LEASES --

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:44.895
ANNUALLY REVIEWING THOSE RENTAL

00:47:44.962 --> 00:47:47.731
RATES FOR EMPLOYEE HOUSING AND

00:47:47.798 --> 00:47:49.533
THEN FOR RECOMMENDATIONS TO TGS

00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:51.535
RELATED TO THEIR DOCUMENTATION

00:47:51.602 --> 00:47:52.703
THEIR DECISION MAKING WITH

00:47:52.769 --> 00:47:55.505
RESPECT TO WHAT THEY'RE CHARGING

00:47:55.572 --> 00:47:57.174
FOR RENTAL RATES WHEN THEY LEASE

00:47:57.241 --> 00:47:58.141
PROPERTIES --

00:47:58.208 --> 00:47:59.176
MAKING SURE THAT THEY'VE

00:47:59.243 --> 00:48:00.510
DOCUMENTED IF THEY MAKE A

00:48:00.577 --> 00:48:02.179
DECISION TO REDUCE THE RENTAL

00:48:02.246 --> 00:48:04.081
AMOUNT BASED ON IMPROVEMENTS OR

00:48:04.147 --> 00:48:05.582
OTHER SERVICES THAT ENTITIES

00:48:05.649 --> 00:48:07.150
PROVIDING TO THE STATE LET'S

00:48:07.217 --> 00:48:08.051
MAKE SURE ALL OF THAT IS

00:48:08.118 --> 00:48:10.087
PROPERLY DOCUMENTED IN THE IN

00:48:10.153 --> 00:48:11.822
THE FILES SO THAT.

00:48:11.888 --> 00:48:13.123
WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION --

00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:15.192
WITH THAT I'M GONNA HANDED OVER

00:48:15.259 --> 00:48:16.760
TO MS MELON AND SHE'LL TALK

00:48:16.827 --> 00:48:18.595
ABOUT THE THE THE THIRD --

00:48:18.662 --> 00:48:21.398
ISSUE WE IDENTIFIED IN THE TO

00:48:21.465 --> 00:48:23.100
ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU

00:48:23.166 --> 00:48:23.767
THANK YOU.

00:48:23.834 --> 00:48:24.901
HI GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR

00:48:24.968 --> 00:48:26.603
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES MY

00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:28.338
NAME IS AMANDA MELON AND AS A

00:48:28.405 --> 00:48:29.940
STATE AUDITOR SAID I WAS A

00:48:30.007 --> 00:48:30.540
SUPERVISOR IN THIS PARTICULAR

00:48:30.607 --> 00:48:31.308
AUDIT.

00:48:31.375 --> 00:48:33.143
AND I'LL COVER THE LAST KEEP

00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:33.777
FINDING THAT WE MADE DURING OUR

00:48:33.844 --> 00:48:34.611
AUDIT.

00:48:34.678 --> 00:48:36.113
AND THAT WAS THAT CALVET HAD A

00:48:36.179 --> 00:48:37.881
VERY DISTANT APPROACH TO

00:48:37.948 --> 00:48:39.216
MANAGING THE USES OF THE

00:48:39.283 --> 00:48:40.284
PROPERTIES.

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:42.119
AND THAT RESULTED IN USES THAT

00:48:42.185 --> 00:48:43.887
EXPOSE THE STATE AND THE HOME TO

00:48:43.954 --> 00:48:45.589
RISK OF LIABILITY.

00:48:45.656 --> 00:48:46.857
AND IT BECAUSE CALVET TO MISS AN

00:48:46.923 --> 00:48:48.258
OPPORTUNITY TO CLICK FUNDING

00:48:48.325 --> 00:48:49.226
THAT COULD HAVE GONE BACK TO THE

00:48:49.293 --> 00:48:50.294
HOME TO BENEFIT THE VETERAN

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:51.428
RESIDENTS.

00:48:51.495 --> 00:48:52.663
SO FOR STARTERS THERE WERE FOUR

00:48:52.729 --> 00:48:54.264
ENTITIES THAT WERE OCCUPYING

00:48:54.331 --> 00:48:56.700
SPACE AT THE YOUNG BILL HOME.

00:48:56.767 --> 00:48:59.836
AND CAL THE HEADQUARTERS WAS

00:48:59.903 --> 00:49:00.804
UNAWARE THAT THEY WERE THERE.

00:49:00.871 --> 00:49:02.139
UNTIL THEY BEGAN PREPARING FOR

00:49:02.205 --> 00:49:04.975
AUDIT. ONE OF THOSE ENTITIES AS

00:49:05.042 --> 00:49:05.876
NAPA VALLEY COLLEGE IN THE

00:49:05.942 --> 00:49:07.577
OCCUPIED A SIZEABLE AMOUNT OF

00:49:07.644 --> 00:49:09.579
SPACE IN A FORMER I SEE YOU IN

00:49:09.646 --> 00:49:10.914
THE HOLDER IN BUILDING IN A

00:49:10.981 --> 00:49:11.982
HOSPITAL THERE.

00:49:12.049 --> 00:49:13.083
AND WE FOUND EVIDENCE THAT THEY

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:15.018
HAD OCCUPIED SPACE AT THE HOME

00:49:15.085 --> 00:49:16.153
FOR THIRTY YEARS.

00:49:16.219 --> 00:49:17.654
SO IT WAS SURPRISING TO US THAT

00:49:17.721 --> 00:49:19.623
CALVET HEADQUARTERS IS UNAWARE

00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:20.924
THAT THEY WERE THERE.

00:49:20.991 --> 00:49:22.392
ON TOP OF THAT NONE OF THOSE FOR

00:49:22.459 --> 00:49:23.927
ENTITIES HAD WRITTEN AGREEMENTS

00:49:23.994 --> 00:49:25.529
FOR THE USE OF THEIR SPACE.

00:49:25.595 --> 00:49:27.030
SO THAT EXPOSE THE STATE TO

00:49:27.097 --> 00:49:28.665
SIGNIFICANT RISK OF LIABILITY IN

00:49:28.732 --> 00:49:29.666
THE EVENT THAT SOMETHING

00:49:29.733 --> 00:49:31.234
HAPPENED IN ONE OF THOSE SPACES.

00:49:31.301 --> 00:49:32.969
AND NONE OF THOSE ENTITIES WERE

00:49:33.036 --> 00:49:34.438
PAYING ANY RENT FOR THE SPACE

00:49:34.504 --> 00:49:35.772
THEY WERE OCCUPYING.

00:49:35.839 --> 00:49:37.307
AND SO CAL THAT HAD MISSED A

00:49:37.374 --> 00:49:38.975
REAL OPPORTUNITY TO COLLECT

00:49:39.042 --> 00:49:40.243
ADDITIONAL FUNDING THAT COULD

00:49:40.310 --> 00:49:41.211
HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE

00:49:41.278 --> 00:49:43.313
OPERATION OF THE HOME TO THE

00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:44.548
BENEFIT OF THE VETERAN RESIDENTS.

00:49:44.614 --> 00:49:47.918
SO WE MADE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS

00:49:47.984 --> 00:49:49.953
TO ON THIS THAT THEY REVIEW

00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:52.322
THOSE FOR ENTITIES AND EVALUATED

00:49:52.389 --> 00:49:54.324
DETERMINE WHETHER THEIR PRESENCE.

00:49:54.391 --> 00:49:55.659
IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE

00:49:55.726 --> 00:49:57.327
HOME AND IF THEY ARE WORK WITH

00:49:57.394 --> 00:49:59.563
TGS TO DEVELOP LEASE AGREEMENTS

00:49:59.629 --> 00:50:01.264
FOR THEM IF THEY'RE NOT THEY

00:50:01.331 --> 00:50:01.998
SHOULD HAVE PICKED THEM.

00:50:02.065 --> 00:50:04.000
AND SO CALVET STARTED WORKING ON

00:50:04.067 --> 00:50:05.535
THIS DURING OUR AUDIT NOW THEY

00:50:05.602 --> 00:50:09.606
REQUESTED AT LEAST FROM TGS FOR

00:50:09.673 --> 00:50:10.741
ONE OF THE ENTITIES A NAPA

00:50:10.807 --> 00:50:13.744
COUNTY HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES.

00:50:13.810 --> 00:50:14.511
AND IS REVIEWING THE OTHERS.

00:50:14.578 --> 00:50:15.545
THERE WERE OTHER USES OF THE

00:50:15.612 --> 00:50:16.646
PROPERTIES THAT CAL THAT WASN'T

00:50:16.713 --> 00:50:17.848
AWARE OF AS WELL.

00:50:17.914 --> 00:50:21.685
CALVET FOUND NOW IN OCTOBER.

00:50:21.752 --> 00:50:22.285
TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE YOUNG

00:50:22.352 --> 00:50:23.353
BILL HOME HAD BEEN PERMITTING

00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:24.788
SHORT TERM USES.

00:50:24.855 --> 00:50:25.989
OF THE PROPERTY --

00:50:26.056 --> 00:50:27.891
BY THIRD PARTIES AND THAT THE

00:50:27.958 --> 00:50:29.059
HOME HAD NOT ALWAYS REQUIRED

00:50:29.126 --> 00:50:30.694
WRITTEN AGREEMENTS AGAIN

00:50:30.761 --> 00:50:32.596
EXPOSURE TO RISK.

00:50:32.662 --> 00:50:33.897
AND HAD NOT ALWAYS COLLECTED

00:50:33.964 --> 00:50:37.300
FEES FOR THOSE USES AGAIN FOR

00:50:37.367 --> 00:50:39.436
GOING FUNDING.

00:50:39.503 --> 00:50:40.537
SO WE EXPECTED THAT WHEN CAL THE

00:50:40.604 --> 00:50:41.405
HEADQUARTERS FOUND OUT ABOUT

00:50:41.471 --> 00:50:42.773
THESE USES THAT THEY WOULD TAKE

00:50:42.839 --> 00:50:44.941
APPROPRIATE STEPS TO ADDRESS

00:50:45.008 --> 00:50:46.476
THOSE ISSUES BUT IT DID NOT.

00:50:46.543 --> 00:50:47.944
IT DEVELOPED A WRITTEN AGREEMENT

00:50:48.011 --> 00:50:49.212
BUT IT ONLY REQUIRED THEM

00:50:49.279 --> 00:50:50.747
SOMETIMES IT DIDN'T REQUIRE

00:50:50.814 --> 00:50:52.616
EVERY THIRD PARTY THEY USE A

00:50:52.682 --> 00:50:53.717
PROPERTY TO SIGN IT.

00:50:53.784 --> 00:50:55.252
IT CHARGE SOME FEES BUT IT

00:50:55.318 --> 00:50:56.253
DIDN'T CHARGE THEM ALL OF THE

00:50:56.319 --> 00:50:57.854
TIME SOME PAID A FEE SOME DID

00:50:57.921 --> 00:50:59.489
NOT AND EVEN THOSE THAT DID PAY

00:50:59.556 --> 00:51:02.025
FEES THEY PAID INCONSISTENT FEES

00:51:02.092 --> 00:51:03.894
FOR THE SAME USE OF THE PROPERTY.

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:05.262
BUT MOST TROUBLING IS THAT

00:51:05.328 --> 00:51:06.596
SIMILAR TO WHAT THE STATE

00:51:06.663 --> 00:51:08.765
AUDITOR SAID ABOUT THE LEASES OF

00:51:08.832 --> 00:51:10.467
THE PROPERTY IS THAT CALVET HAD

00:51:10.534 --> 00:51:12.335
NEVER DEFINED WHAT TYPES OF USES

00:51:12.402 --> 00:51:13.870
WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THE

00:51:13.937 --> 00:51:15.572
BEST INTERESTS OF THE HOME.

00:51:15.639 --> 00:51:17.040
AND IT PERMITTED ONE USE OF THE

00:51:17.107 --> 00:51:18.175
VETERANS HOME PROPERTY THAT WE

00:51:18.241 --> 00:51:19.709
FOUND WERE CONTRARY TO THOSE

00:51:19.776 --> 00:51:20.610
INTERESTS.

00:51:20.677 --> 00:51:23.413
SO CALVET PERMITTED A FILM CREW

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:25.015
TO GO INTO THE WEST LOS ANGELES

00:51:25.081 --> 00:51:27.484
HOME WHICH IS LARGELY A SKILLED

00:51:27.551 --> 00:51:29.352
NURSING FACILITY AT THE HOSPITAL.

00:51:29.419 --> 00:51:30.487
THAT FILM CREW WENT IN THERE AND

00:51:30.554 --> 00:51:31.555
FILL IN THE TELEVISION SHOW.

00:51:31.621 --> 00:51:33.023
CLEARLY THAT IS SOMETHING THAT

00:51:33.089 --> 00:51:36.593
COULD BE JUST THERE AND IT COULD

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:38.195
RISK VIOLATING THEIR PRIVACY SO

00:51:38.261 --> 00:51:40.764
WHY CALVET EVER PERMITTED THAT

00:51:40.831 --> 00:51:42.966
TO HAPPEN IS UNCLEAR.

00:51:43.033 --> 00:51:44.634
SO WE MADE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS

00:51:44.701 --> 00:51:45.669
TO THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT THIS

00:51:45.735 --> 00:51:47.337
PARTICULAR ISSUE WE RECOMMENDED

00:51:47.404 --> 00:51:48.839
THAT THE LEGISLATURE.

00:51:48.905 --> 00:51:50.874
REQUIRE CALVET TO INCORPORATE

00:51:50.941 --> 00:51:52.342
INTO REGULATION SPECIFIC

00:51:52.409 --> 00:51:53.877
CRITERIA ABOUT WHAT TYPES OF

00:51:53.944 --> 00:51:55.812
THESE USES CONSISTENT WITH THE

00:51:55.879 --> 00:51:57.147
BEST INTERESTS OF VETERANS IN

00:51:57.214 --> 00:51:58.582
THE HOME.

00:51:58.648 --> 00:52:00.884
THAT IT DENY ANY USES THAT ARE

00:52:00.951 --> 00:52:02.486
THAT DON'T MEET THAT CRITERIA.

00:52:02.552 --> 00:52:04.754
THAT IT ESTABLISH A FEE SCHEDULE

00:52:04.821 --> 00:52:05.989
FOR THOSE USES --

00:52:06.056 --> 00:52:06.957
AND THEN IT REQUIRE WRITTEN

00:52:07.023 --> 00:52:08.792
AGREEMENTS THAT PROTECT THE

00:52:08.859 --> 00:52:10.393
INTERESTS OF THE STATE.

00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:12.462
SO THAT SUMS UP OUR KEY FINDINGS

00:52:12.529 --> 00:52:13.663
THAT WE MADE IN OUR AUDIT BUT

00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:14.998
WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

00:52:15.065 --> 00:52:17.834
QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE.

00:52:17.901 --> 00:52:18.435
THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR

00:52:18.502 --> 00:52:20.937
PRESENTATION AND KINDA LAYING.

00:52:21.004 --> 00:52:22.439
THE GROUND WORK IN THE FRAMEWORK

00:52:22.506 --> 00:52:23.773
FOR WHICH WE ARE WE ARE GOING

00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:25.275
OPERATE FROM --

00:52:25.342 --> 00:52:26.409
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT OF

00:52:26.476 --> 00:52:27.944
ISSUES IDENTIFIED BUT I THINK

00:52:28.011 --> 00:52:31.047
WHAT I'LL DO IS I'LL DEFER --

00:52:31.114 --> 00:52:32.682
TO MY COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE A

00:52:32.749 --> 00:52:34.251
LIST OF QUESTIONS AS WELL BUT

00:52:34.317 --> 00:52:35.519
LET ME AT THIS TIME WE ASK --

00:52:35.585 --> 00:52:37.220
CENTER ARCHULETA FEW WANTS TO

00:52:37.287 --> 00:52:39.122
BEGIN -- HIS

00:52:39.189 --> 00:52:40.924
LINE OF QUESTIONING.

00:52:40.991 --> 00:52:43.059
THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

00:52:43.126 --> 00:52:44.494
YOUR PRESENTATION --

00:52:44.561 --> 00:52:47.497
TRULY INFORMATIVE THANK YOU --

00:52:47.564 --> 00:52:48.365
AND TROUBLING.

00:52:48.431 --> 00:52:48.832
NO DOUBT.

00:52:48.899 --> 00:52:52.402
OF IT IN YOUR REPORT YOU CALVET

00:52:52.469 --> 00:52:54.804
FAILED TO ENSURE THAT SIX

00:52:54.871 --> 00:52:56.006
HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:52:56.072 --> 00:52:57.374
WAS APPROPRIATIONS HOW DO WE

00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:58.675
REACH THAT NUMBER.

00:52:58.742 --> 00:53:00.610
IN IS THAT NUMBER GROWING AS WE

00:53:00.677 --> 00:53:01.444
SIT HERE.

00:53:01.511 --> 00:53:03.580
AND IF WE DON'T TAKE ACTION

00:53:03.647 --> 00:53:05.482
IMMEDIATELY WILL IT GROW AND HOW

00:53:05.549 --> 00:53:08.752
CAN WE STOP.

00:53:08.818 --> 00:53:10.387
THANK YOU SENATOR --

00:53:10.453 --> 00:53:11.988
SOME OF THE MONEY ACTUALLY HAS

00:53:12.055 --> 00:53:13.957
BEEN COLLECTED BY THE STATE SO

00:53:14.024 --> 00:53:15.458
WHEN I WAS REFERRING TO THE

00:53:15.525 --> 00:53:18.361
CALVET COLLECTED THREE HUNDRED

00:53:18.428 --> 00:53:18.962
NINETY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS.

00:53:19.029 --> 00:53:20.497
DEPOSITED IN THE GENERAL FUND

00:53:20.564 --> 00:53:22.132
BUT DIDN'T NOTIFY FINANCE FOR

00:53:22.198 --> 00:53:23.833
THE LEGISLATURE'S THAT MONEY HAS

00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:25.835
BEEN COLLECTED BY CAL THAT ALSO

00:53:25.902 --> 00:53:26.670
THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL

00:53:26.736 --> 00:53:28.038
SERVICES COLLECTED ABOUT A

00:53:28.104 --> 00:53:29.906
HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN THOUSAND

00:53:29.973 --> 00:53:30.507
DOLLARS RELATED TO SOME OTHER

00:53:30.574 --> 00:53:31.975
LEASES --

00:53:32.042 --> 00:53:32.876
THAT -- WE

00:53:32.943 --> 00:53:34.177
BELIEVE NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED

00:53:34.244 --> 00:53:36.212
BECAUSE THAT MONEY WAS COLLECTED

00:53:36.279 --> 00:53:37.847
HOWEVER DGSE TO POT AND NOT

00:53:37.914 --> 00:53:39.482
DEPOSITED IN THE GENERAL FUND

00:53:39.549 --> 00:53:40.984
THEY DEPOSITED IT IN A DIFFERENT

00:53:41.051 --> 00:53:42.185
FUND SO THAT NEEDS TO BE

00:53:42.252 --> 00:53:43.253
RECTIFIED.

00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:44.854
AND THEN THE LAST PIECE GETTING

00:53:44.921 --> 00:53:46.656
UP TO THE HUNDRED TO SIX HUNDRED

00:53:46.723 --> 00:53:47.991
TEN IS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND ONE

00:53:48.058 --> 00:53:48.525
THOUSAND DOLLARS.

00:53:48.592 --> 00:53:50.660
AND THAT IS FUNDS THAT I WAS

00:53:50.727 --> 00:53:52.095
REFERRING TO WHEN I TALKED ABOUT

00:53:52.162 --> 00:53:53.997
THE CONVENIENCE STORE AND THE

00:53:54.064 --> 00:53:55.365
GOLF COURSE OF THOSE ENTITIES

00:53:55.432 --> 00:53:57.567
HAD NOT PAID THE AMOUNTS DUE TO

00:53:57.634 --> 00:53:59.469
THE STATE SO THAT ONE HUNDRED

00:53:59.536 --> 00:54:00.003
THOUSAND DOLLARS.

00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:01.471
AGAIN AS IN A RECOMMENDATION

00:54:01.538 --> 00:54:03.340
WHERE WE BELIEVE CAL THAT NEEDS

00:54:03.406 --> 00:54:05.308
TO GET THAT GET THOSE FUNDS FROM

00:54:05.375 --> 00:54:06.910
THOSE TWO ENTITIES SO THERE'S A

00:54:06.977 --> 00:54:07.877
PIECE THE STATE IS ALREADY

00:54:07.944 --> 00:54:09.279
RECEIVEDAND THEN THERE'S A

00:54:09.346 --> 00:54:10.547
PIECE THAT THE STATE.

00:54:10.614 --> 00:54:13.183
NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO PURSUE --

00:54:13.249 --> 00:54:14.985
FROM BOTH OF THOSE TWO ENTITIES

00:54:15.051 --> 00:54:15.619
AT YON PHIL.

00:54:15.685 --> 00:54:16.886
AND LET ME ASK YOU ONE OTHER

00:54:16.953 --> 00:54:21.691
THING ABOUT THE BOY APPLE LEASES

00:54:21.758 --> 00:54:25.395
IN THOSE WE SAT DOWN WITH THE

00:54:25.462 --> 00:54:27.564
THE ATTORNEYS AND ALSO MAY BE

00:54:27.631 --> 00:54:29.532
BROUGHT IN THE ENTITIES TO SEE

00:54:29.599 --> 00:54:30.867
IF WE COULD RE NEGOTIATE THEM.

00:54:30.934 --> 00:54:34.004
BECAUSE I WOULD THINK THAT THOSE

00:54:34.070 --> 00:54:34.971
IN THE OTHER SIDE WE'VE BEEN

00:54:35.038 --> 00:54:36.873
USING THE FACILITIES YEAR AFTER

00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:38.942
YEAR FOR DECADES --

00:54:39.009 --> 00:54:40.877
WOULD BE WILLING TO SIT AT THE

00:54:40.944 --> 00:54:43.046
TABLE AND RE NEGOTIATE AND

00:54:43.113 --> 00:54:44.214
OBVIOUSLY SOME OF THESE LEASES

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:46.483
SHOULD BE COMPLETELY AVOIDED OUT

00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:48.518
IN REACHED RENEGOTIATED IF THEY

00:54:48.585 --> 00:54:51.354
WISH.

00:54:51.421 --> 00:54:53.690
SO WHETHER CALVET CAN GET OUT OF

00:54:53.757 --> 00:54:54.624
THE LEAST DEPENDS ON THE LEASE

00:54:54.691 --> 00:54:56.326
SO ONE OF THEM IS THE POLICE

00:54:56.393 --> 00:54:57.861
THAT ONE'S VOID SO THAT WHEN

00:54:57.927 --> 00:54:59.529
THEY CAN GET OUT OF THERE ARE

00:54:59.596 --> 00:55:01.197
OTHERS THAT CONTAIN TERMINATION

00:55:01.264 --> 00:55:02.465
CLAUSES THAT ALLOW THEM TO

00:55:02.532 --> 00:55:04.167
TERMINATE AT WILL.

00:55:04.234 --> 00:55:06.102
WITH NOTICE TO THE TENANT BUT

00:55:06.169 --> 00:55:09.172
THERE ARE THREE LEASES THAT ARE --

00:55:09.239 --> 00:55:11.007
FAR BEYOND THE FIVE YEAR TERM

00:55:11.074 --> 00:55:12.642
THEY DO NOT CONTAIN TERMINATION

00:55:12.709 --> 00:55:14.644
CLAUSE THAT ALLOW THE STATE TO

00:55:14.711 --> 00:55:16.112
TERMINATE FOR WHATEVER REASON

00:55:16.179 --> 00:55:17.747
THE WANT TO STAY AUTHOR MENTION

00:55:17.814 --> 00:55:19.149
WHERE THE HOUSE BECAUSE THE

00:55:19.215 --> 00:55:21.184
TENANT HAS TO BE IN BREACH OF

00:55:21.251 --> 00:55:22.585
THEIR AGREEMENT.

00:55:22.652 --> 00:55:24.054
AND THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:25.021
GONNA BE TRICKY THAT'S THE

00:55:25.088 --> 00:55:26.523
MUSEUM THE THEATER.

00:55:26.589 --> 00:55:28.324
AND THE GOLF COURSE SO ONE OF

00:55:28.391 --> 00:55:29.793
OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ADDRESSES

00:55:29.859 --> 00:55:31.761
THIS IT SAYS TO CALVIN DDS THAT

00:55:31.828 --> 00:55:33.430
THEY NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO

00:55:33.496 --> 00:55:36.633
TRY TO RENEGOTIATE ANY LEASES

00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:37.734
THAT ARE NOT CONSISTENT.

00:55:37.801 --> 00:55:38.334
WITH THE BEST INTEREST OF THE

00:55:38.401 --> 00:55:40.437
HOME OR THE VIOLATE STATE LAW SO

00:55:40.503 --> 00:55:41.571
THE EXTENT THAT WERE ABLE TO GET

00:55:41.638 --> 00:55:43.139
OF THOSE WILL BE TOTALLY UP TO

00:55:43.206 --> 00:55:44.474
WHATEVER THEY'RE ABLE TO

00:55:44.541 --> 00:55:45.975
NEGOTIATE WITH THE TENANTS.

00:55:46.042 --> 00:55:47.677
IN MY LAST QUESTION WAS CHAIR IS

00:55:47.744 --> 00:55:49.713
IN REFERENCE TO THE EMPLOYEE

00:55:49.779 --> 00:55:51.281
HOUSING --

00:55:51.347 --> 00:55:52.682
RAISING THOSE RENTS AT 25% PER

00:55:52.749 --> 00:55:54.250
YEAR HAS ANYONE SAT DOWN WITH

00:55:54.317 --> 00:55:55.685
SOME THE TENANTS --

00:55:55.752 --> 00:55:57.353
SLASH EMPLOYEES TO KNOW THAT

00:55:57.420 --> 00:55:59.022
IT'S COMING AT THE THIS MAY

00:55:59.089 --> 00:56:02.092
HAPPEN.

00:56:02.158 --> 00:56:03.626
YES MY UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THAT

00:56:03.693 --> 00:56:04.160
IS THAT THEY HAVE ALREADY

00:56:04.227 --> 00:56:05.328
STARTED THESE --

00:56:05.395 --> 00:56:06.496
THEY'VE NOTICED ALL OF THE

00:56:06.563 --> 00:56:07.163
EMPLOYEES THAT THEY'RE GOING TO

00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:08.364
RAISE THE RENT NAY INTEND TO

00:56:08.431 --> 00:56:11.634
RAISE EVERYONE'S RENT BY 25%

00:56:11.701 --> 00:56:11.935
[inaudible]

00:56:12.001 --> 00:56:13.036
THANK YOU.

00:56:13.103 --> 00:56:13.737
WE JUST CONTINUE ON THAT LINE OF

00:56:13.803 --> 00:56:15.171
QUESTIONING THOSE ONE OF MY

00:56:15.238 --> 00:56:16.606
QUESTIONS AS WELL.

00:56:16.673 --> 00:56:19.075
IF WE INCREASED 25% TO HELP

00:56:19.142 --> 00:56:20.577
BRING IT BACK UP TO MARKET RATE

00:56:20.643 --> 00:56:22.879
VALUES HOW MANY YEARS DO WE NEED

00:56:22.946 --> 00:56:25.882
TO DO THIS TO GET TO MARKET RATE.

00:56:25.949 --> 00:56:29.953
SO IT DEPENDS ON THE INDIVIDUAL

00:56:30.019 --> 00:56:32.255
LEASE SO EACH LEASES VALID FOR A

00:56:32.322 --> 00:56:33.957
CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME --

00:56:34.023 --> 00:56:36.226
FOR SOME FOLKS THEY HAVE --

00:56:36.292 --> 00:56:37.327
PRIORITY HOUSING IT MEANS THAT

00:56:37.393 --> 00:56:38.394
THEY CAN STAND THERE FOR AN

00:56:38.461 --> 00:56:39.796
EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. FOR

00:56:39.863 --> 00:56:41.264
OTHERS THEIR LEASES ONLY LIKE A

00:56:41.331 --> 00:56:42.999
YEAR LONG --

00:56:43.066 --> 00:56:45.468
WHEN THE HOUSE CHANGES HANDS

00:56:45.535 --> 00:56:47.070
TEMAS EN CALVET CAN IMMEDIATELY

00:56:47.137 --> 00:56:49.172
CHARGE MARKET RENT SO FOR ANY

00:56:49.239 --> 00:56:51.641
HOMES WHERE THE TENANT LEAVES WE

00:56:51.708 --> 00:56:53.076
CAN DO THAT AUTOMATICALLY?

00:56:53.143 --> 00:56:54.310
IT'S THOSE WHERE THERE'S SOMEONE

00:56:54.377 --> 00:56:55.512
IN THE HOUSE RIGHT NOW THAT IT

00:56:55.578 --> 00:56:57.981
MIGHT TAKE A FEW YEARS BEFORE WE

00:56:58.047 --> 00:57:00.450
CAN GET IT TO MARKET RENT.

00:57:00.517 --> 00:57:01.551

FOCUSED AT YON PHIL.

00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:35.351
THE MAJORITY OF THE LEASES ARE

00:57:35.418 --> 00:57:37.287
YON PHIL THERE ONLY TO LEASES

00:57:37.353 --> 00:57:38.588
THAT WE REVIEW THAT WERE AT

00:57:38.655 --> 00:57:40.757
OTHER HOMES SO THERE'S A SALON

00:57:40.824 --> 00:57:41.658
IT FRESNO.

00:57:41.724 --> 00:57:44.260
AND A TELECOMMUNICATION FACILITY

00:57:44.327 --> 00:57:44.994
TO LIVE IS TO THERE'S AN ATM

00:57:45.061 --> 00:57:46.529

TELECOMMUNICATION FACILITY LEASE

00:57:57.907 --> 00:58:00.944
AND WE FOUND THAT.

00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:04.247
THE DURATION AT LEAST WAS.

00:58:04.314 --> 00:58:05.281
THERE'S AN EXCEPTION FOR OUR

00:58:05.348 --> 00:58:06.749
TELECOMMUNICATION FACILITIES IF

00:58:06.816 --> 00:58:07.684
THEY CAN BE TEN YEARS LONG AND

00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:08.885
LEASES TEN YEARS LONG.

00:58:08.952 --> 00:58:10.520
WE ALSO FOUND SOME EVIDENCE THE

DS A CONSIDERED MARKET RENT FOR

00:58:12.522 --> 00:58:13.957
THAT FACILITY SO WE DIDN'T

00:58:14.023 --> 00:58:15.792
IDENTIFY ANY MAJOR ISSUES WITH

00:58:15.859 --> 00:58:16.926
THAT PARTICULAR LEASE.

00:58:16.993 --> 00:58:18.194
OKAY AND THEN --

I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS A

00:58:19.629 --> 00:58:22.031
QUESTION FOR YOU OR TGS BUT WITH

00:58:22.098 --> 00:58:24.667
THE MUSEUM LEASE AGREEMENT IT

00:58:24.734 --> 00:58:26.336
DOESN'T STIPULATE WHAT HAPPENS.

00:58:26.402 --> 00:58:31.407
AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE

00:58:31.474 --> 00:58:32.442
FIFTY TWO AT LEAST IT DOES

00:58:32.508 --> 00:58:33.443

00:58:40.450 --> 00:58:41.718
LEASING MAY TRANSFER THE

00:58:41.784 --> 00:58:43.086
PROPERTY WITH THE STATE'S

00:58:43.152 --> 00:58:44.654

ACTUALLY WILL HAPPEN TO THE

00:58:49.325 --> 00:58:51.561
PROPERTY AFTER FIFTY TWO YEARS

00:58:51.628 --> 00:58:53.363
OR DO WE NEED TO ASK TGS FOR

00:58:53.429 --> 00:58:54.898
THAT OR IS THERE NO ANSWER I I

00:58:54.964 --> 00:59:01.704
THINK THAT'S A QUESTION FOR DTS

[inaudible]

00:59:02.071 --> 00:59:03.006
THANK YOU.

00:59:03.072 --> 00:59:04.007
I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS AND

00:59:04.073 --> 00:59:06.409
THEN WE'LL MOVE TO OTHER MEMBERS --

00:59:06.476 --> 00:59:07.410

YOU KNOW THANK YOU FOR FOR

00:59:09.212 --> 00:59:11.314
PRESENTING THE THREE KEY AREAS

00:59:11.381 --> 00:59:12.215
IT ANY SUCH AGREEMENTS

00:59:12.282 --> 00:59:14.484
COLLECTING REVENUE STATE STATE --

00:59:14.550 --> 00:59:15.451
LIABILITY --

00:59:15.518 --> 00:59:17.387
I'M JUST GONNA CONTINUE FIRST

00:59:17.453 --> 00:59:18.288
WITH THE LINE OF QUESTIONING

00:59:18.354 --> 00:59:19.722
MISTER WHEN HAD IN TERMS OF LIKE

00:59:19.789 --> 00:59:20.723
THE LEASES.

00:59:20.790 --> 00:59:23.059
SO WE IDENTIFIED THREE LONG TERM

00:59:23.126 --> 00:59:27.263
LEASES ON I'M SORRY YOUR

00:59:27.330 --> 00:59:28.364
COLLEAGUE.

00:59:28.431 --> 00:59:31.000
I DON'T HAVE THE AGENDA FOR ME.

00:59:31.067 --> 00:59:33.102
AMANDA MAILING A MAN MANTA

00:59:33.169 --> 00:59:34.504
MILLEN --

00:59:34.570 --> 00:59:36.072
YOU IDENTIFIED IN THE GOLF THE

00:59:36.139 --> 00:59:40.310
GOLF COURSE FOR INSTANCE THAT --

00:59:40.376 --> 00:59:42.211
THERE MIGHT POSSIBLY BE A BREACH

00:59:42.278 --> 00:59:43.913
BECAUSE A PERCENTAGE OF THE

00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:45.315
CELLS TO NOT GO BACK TO THE

00:59:45.381 --> 00:59:46.683
VETERAN SO TO ME THAT'S LAS

00:59:46.749 --> 00:59:48.318
REVENUE --

00:59:48.384 --> 00:59:49.786
FOR THE MORALE FUND AND WHATEVER

00:59:49.852 --> 00:59:51.621
ELSE VETERANS NEED WOULD THAT BE

00:59:51.688 --> 00:59:52.855
SOMETHING.

00:59:52.922 --> 00:59:53.990
A LEGAL STANDING FOR THE STATE

00:59:54.057 --> 00:59:58.094
ACTUALLY RE NEGOTIATE THAT LEASE --

00:59:58.161 --> 00:59:59.862
SO LET ME ADD A LITTLE BIT MORE

00:59:59.929 --> 01:00:00.430
INFORMATION ABOUT THE GOLF

01:00:00.496 --> 01:00:02.265
COURSE PERCENTAGE RENT PAYMENTS

01:00:02.332 --> 01:00:03.599
THE GOLF COURSE HAD BEEN MAKING

01:00:03.666 --> 01:00:05.134
PERCENTAGE RENT PAYMENTS EVERY

01:00:05.201 --> 01:00:05.969
YEAR.

01:00:06.035 --> 01:00:08.204
THE REASON WHY CALVET DIDN'T

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:08.771
COLLECT THE FULL AMOUNT OF

01:00:08.838 --> 01:00:10.773
PERCENTAGE RENT IS BECAUSE

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.108
CALVET HAD NOT.

01:00:12.175 --> 01:00:13.743
CALCULATED THE AMOUNT THAT THE

01:00:13.810 --> 01:00:15.778
GOLF COURSE ACTUALLY NEEDED TO

01:00:15.845 --> 01:00:18.114
PAY. TO DETERMINE THAT THE GOLF

01:00:18.181 --> 01:00:20.550
COURSE HAD PAID ENOUGH AND SO IT

01:00:20.616 --> 01:00:22.919
WAS REALLY CAL THAT FAULT THAT

01:00:22.986 --> 01:00:23.820
THEY WEREN'T COLLECTING THE

01:00:23.886 --> 01:00:24.387
TOTAL AMOUNT.

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:25.655
ON THAT --

01:00:25.722 --> 01:00:26.756
THEY ARE.

01:00:26.823 --> 01:00:28.057
THEY HAVEN'T PAID THE FULL

01:00:28.124 --> 01:00:30.493
AMOUNT THAT WAS DUE BUT I THINK

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:31.995
MISTER DAWSON.

01:00:32.061 --> 01:00:33.496
WEIGH IN ON WHETHER THERE HI

01:00:33.563 --> 01:00:33.930
CHRIS FOR DAWSON --

01:00:33.997 --> 01:00:36.866
SEEN -- AS

01:00:36.933 --> 01:00:38.668
MISS KNOWN WAS INDICATING THAT

01:00:38.735 --> 01:00:42.071
WAS A COLLECTION ISSUE AND WE

01:00:42.138 --> 01:00:44.040
DIDN'T NEED WE DIDN'T ANALYZE IT

01:00:44.107 --> 01:00:45.308
IN THE SENSE THAT IT WOULD BE A

01:00:45.375 --> 01:00:47.710
BREACH I THINK THAT'S A QUESTION

01:00:47.777 --> 01:00:48.077
FOR TGS COUNCIL.

01:00:48.144 --> 01:00:49.579
CON.

01:00:49.645 --> 01:00:52.215
ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU --

YOU KNOW YOU HAD MENTIONED ALSO

01:00:54.417 --> 01:00:56.285
IN YOUR PRESENTATION.

01:00:56.352 --> 01:00:56.953
THE LENGTH.

01:00:57.020 --> 01:01:00.256
OF THE THE LEASES YOU KNOW IN A

01:01:00.323 --> 01:01:01.691
LOT OF THEM ARE NOT TO EXCEED

01:01:01.758 --> 01:01:03.292
FIVE YEARS BUT IN YOUR FINDINGS

01:01:03.359 --> 01:01:05.461
DID YOU HOW MANY LEASES ACTUALLY

01:01:05.528 --> 01:01:07.230
EXCEEDED FIVE YEARS I KNOW WE'VE

01:01:07.296 --> 01:01:08.031

01:01:08.097 --> 01:01:09.732
YOU KNOW THE SERMON MENTIONED A

01:01:09.799 --> 01:01:10.433
FIFTY TWO YEAR LEASE FOR THE

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.201
MUSEUM FOR INSTANCE BUT HOW MANY

01:01:12.268 --> 01:01:14.570
OF THOSE THE LEASES ACTUALLY

01:01:14.637 --> 01:01:15.338
EXCEEDED FIVE YEARS.

01:01:15.405 --> 01:01:16.706
SO AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THERE

01:01:16.773 --> 01:01:18.341
WERE TWO LEASES THAT EXCEEDED

01:01:18.408 --> 01:01:20.443
FIVE YEARS BUT COULD --

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:21.911
SO ONE OF THOSE IS

01:01:21.978 --> 01:01:23.312
TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITY THE

01:01:23.379 --> 01:01:24.347
TEN YEAR LEASE AND THEN THERE'S

01:01:24.414 --> 01:01:26.115
A FIRE STATION THAT'S TWENTY

01:01:26.182 --> 01:01:26.983
FIVE YEARS.

01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:28.017
AND THAT IS PERMITTED UNDER

01:01:28.084 --> 01:01:29.485
EXCEPTION THAT ALLOWS --

01:01:29.552 --> 01:01:31.220
FACILITIES THAT ARE USED IN

01:01:31.287 --> 01:01:32.722
EMERGENCY RESPONSE.

01:01:32.789 --> 01:01:34.323
THERE WERE FOUR OTHER LEASES

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:36.192
THAT EXCEEDED FIVE YEARS THAT

01:01:36.259 --> 01:01:37.727
DID NOT HAVE SUCH AN EXCEPTION

01:01:37.794 --> 01:01:39.328
THOSE ARE THE THREE THAT YOU

AND THAT ONE DOES HAVE A

01:01:56.546 --> 01:01:57.880
TERMINATION CLAUSE THOUGH.

01:01:57.947 --> 01:01:59.449
THAT ONE ALLOWS THE STATE TO

01:01:59.515 --> 01:02:00.416
TERMINATE THE LEASE WITH A

01:02:00.483 --> 01:02:02.518

SOME OF THE OTHERS.

01:02:15.264 --> 01:02:17.333
RIGHT THEY DON'T HAVE AGREEMENTS --

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:21.037
SO. TO WHAT IF THAT THAT WAS OUR

01:02:21.104 --> 01:02:22.305
MAIN CONCERN WAS THAT IN FACT

01:02:22.371 --> 01:02:23.506
THEY WERE.

01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:25.007
OCCUPYING SPACE OUT THE HOME

01:02:25.074 --> 01:02:27.376

EXPOSES THE STATE.

01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:30.246
TO POSSIBLE LIABILITY AND ALSO

01:02:30.313 --> 01:02:32.682
THERE IS THE LOSS OF THE REVENUE

01:02:32.748 --> 01:02:34.083
THAT THEY OUGHT TO BE COLLECTED.

01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:35.551

01:02:35.618 --> 01:02:38.955

THAT IS CORRECT [inaudible]

01:02:40.523 --> 01:02:42.492
OKAY.

01:02:42.558 --> 01:02:44.160
LET ME JUST ASK A GENERAL

01:02:44.227 --> 01:02:46.062
QUESTION JUST BECAUSE I FEEL

01:02:46.129 --> 01:02:46.996

01:03:21.931 --> 01:03:23.799
WHICH PROBLEMS ARE STILL THE

01:03:23.866 --> 01:03:24.634

AND IF YOU JUST COMMENT ON THAT

01:03:26.669 --> 01:03:28.504

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IT IS

01:03:29.772 --> 01:03:31.607
SOME OF THE ISSUES RELATED TO

01:03:31.674 --> 01:03:33.209
THE AGREEMENTS THE LANGUAGE IN

01:03:33.276 --> 01:03:34.844
THE AGREEMENTS OF THE LENGTH OF

01:03:34.911 --> 01:03:37.013
THE AGREEMENTS ARE SIMILAR.

01:03:37.079 --> 01:03:38.314
CERTAINLY THE ISSUE WE

01:03:38.381 --> 01:03:39.715
IDENTIFIED IN THE INVESTIGATIVE

01:03:39.782 --> 01:03:42.318
REPORT WE WE PUBLISHED BACK IN

01:03:42.385 --> 01:03:43.219
TWENTY THIRTEEN WAS.

01:03:43.286 --> 01:03:44.987
DECISIONS WERE BEING MADE AT THE

01:03:45.054 --> 01:03:46.255
YOUNG BILL HOME THAT

01:03:46.322 --> 01:03:48.224
HEADQUARTERS WASN'T AWARE OF

01:03:48.291 --> 01:03:50.026
ONE'S HEAD QUARTERS BECAME AWARE

01:03:50.092 --> 01:03:52.261
OF IT THEY CEASE AND DESIST AND

01:03:52.328 --> 01:03:52.828
THAT'S WHY THE STATE HAD TO

01:03:52.895 --> 01:03:54.397
NEGOTIATE.

01:03:54.463 --> 01:03:55.865
AND PAY THE VENDOR --

01:03:55.932 --> 01:03:58.100
I'M A LITTLE OVER TWO AND A I

01:03:58.167 --> 01:03:59.068
THINK THE DIFFERENCE WE'RE

01:03:59.135 --> 01:04:01.537
SEEING TODAY AND THAT'S WHY I

01:04:01.604 --> 01:04:03.072
WANTED TO MAKE SURE I I

01:04:03.139 --> 01:04:05.041
COMMENTED IN AND MY PRESENTATION

01:04:05.107 --> 01:04:05.942
IS.

01:04:06.008 --> 01:04:09.178
THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION --

01:04:09.245 --> 01:04:10.413
MEMBER --

01:04:10.479 --> 01:04:12.415
HAS REALLY --

01:04:12.481 --> 01:04:14.183
IN SOME WAYS TRY TO GET AHEAD OF

01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:15.151
THE AUDIT SINCE THE ON IT WAS

01:04:15.218 --> 01:04:17.019
APPROVED THEY WERE OUT OF THE

01:04:17.086 --> 01:04:17.954
DIFFERENT FACILITIES TRYING TO

01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:19.522
UNDERSTAND WHAT ROPERTIES ARE

01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:20.556
RELEASING.

01:04:20.623 --> 01:04:22.491
HOW MANY LEASES THE WE HAVE ONE

01:04:22.558 --> 01:04:23.092
OF THE TERMS OF THOSE LEASES

01:04:23.159 --> 01:04:24.493
ETCETERA REALLY TRYING TO

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:26.529
UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF THE

01:04:26.596 --> 01:04:27.530
CONDITIONS OUT OF THE VARIOUS

01:04:27.597 --> 01:04:28.664
FACILITIES?

01:04:28.731 --> 01:04:29.699
NOW WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF

01:04:29.765 --> 01:04:30.967
THEY HAD KNOWN THAT PRIOR TO AN

01:04:31.033 --> 01:04:33.536
AUDIT BEING REQUESTED APPROVED --

01:04:33.603 --> 01:04:36.105
BUT I ALSO THINK THAT AS I SAID

01:04:36.172 --> 01:04:37.940
THERE WERE SOME STEPS THAT AS WE

01:04:38.007 --> 01:04:39.408
BROUGHT ISSUES TO THE ATTENTION

01:04:39.475 --> 01:04:41.210
OF THE ADMINISTRATION --

01:04:41.277 --> 01:04:43.446
THEY JUST TRIED TO RECTIFY SOME

01:04:43.512 --> 01:04:44.380
OF THOSE ISSUES LIKE I SAID THEY

01:04:44.447 --> 01:04:47.016
DEVELOPED A POLICY IN MAY OF

01:04:47.083 --> 01:04:48.284
EIGHTEEN THEIR ADOPTING THE

01:04:48.351 --> 01:04:49.585
KELLY CHAR POLICY.

01:04:49.652 --> 01:04:50.920
THEY DEVELOPED A POLICY IN

01:04:50.987 --> 01:04:52.955
DECEMBER OF EIGHTEEN THAT WAS

01:04:53.022 --> 01:04:53.389
DISTRIBUTED TO THE

01:04:53.456 --> 01:04:54.557
ADMINISTRATORS --

01:04:54.624 --> 01:04:57.193
WITH RESPECT TO MAKING SURE THEY

01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:58.561
COME UP WITH CRITERIA.

01:04:58.628 --> 01:05:03.933
AS FAR AS IDENTIFYING WHAT WHAT.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:04.567
BEST INTEREST OF THE HOME MEANS

01:05:04.634 --> 01:05:05.768
WHAT KIND OF CRITERIA IN

01:05:05.835 --> 01:05:06.235
MINISTRY TO SHOULD BE

01:05:06.302 --> 01:05:08.904
CONSIDERING BUT I ALSO SEE A

01:05:08.971 --> 01:05:10.673
DIFFERENCE IN THIS PARTICULAR

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:12.742
AUDIT OR RESPONSE TO THIS AUDIT.

01:05:12.808 --> 01:05:13.909
WHERE THE ADMINISTRATION IS

01:05:13.976 --> 01:05:15.044
SAYING WE WANT TO TAKE

01:05:15.111 --> 01:05:16.779
RESPONSIBILITY FOR EMPLOYEE

01:05:16.846 --> 01:05:17.880
HOUSING WE ARE GOING TO BE

01:05:17.947 --> 01:05:19.715
MAKING DECISIONS AT THE AGENCY

01:05:19.782 --> 01:05:21.651
SECRETARY LEVEL THE DEPARTMENT

01:05:21.717 --> 01:05:23.686
BUT THE AGENCY SECRETARY OR HIS

01:05:23.753 --> 01:05:25.554
DESIGNATE WILL BE INVOLVED IN

01:05:25.621 --> 01:05:27.156
SOME OF THESE DECISIONS SO?

01:05:27.223 --> 01:05:29.959
I THINK THAT WE'RE SEEING --

01:05:30.026 --> 01:05:32.762
PROGRESS WITH RESPECT IN THIS

01:05:32.828 --> 01:05:35.031
PARTICULAR ENTITY THAT'S AND

01:05:35.097 --> 01:05:36.065
NOTICED RESPECT TO PRIOR

01:05:36.132 --> 01:05:37.333
ADMINISTRATIONS BUT I SEE A

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:38.668
DIFFERENCE --

01:05:38.734 --> 01:05:40.936
AS I SAID A LOT OF TIMES

01:05:41.003 --> 01:05:42.171
WHENEVER WE CONDUCT AN AUDIT

01:05:42.238 --> 01:05:43.372
WE'RE SHARING INFORMATION WITH

01:05:43.439 --> 01:05:44.774
AN ENTITY TO GIVE THEM THE

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:46.208
OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE CORRECTIVE

01:05:46.275 --> 01:05:48.511
ACTION AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE

01:05:48.577 --> 01:05:49.145

01:05:49.211 --> 01:05:50.112
REPORT.

01:05:50.179 --> 01:05:51.080
LOT OF TIMES YOU DON'T SEE THAT

01:05:51.147 --> 01:05:52.315

01:06:00.823 --> 01:06:02.391
THIS MONTH --

01:06:02.458 --> 01:06:03.826
AND THEN OUR SIX MONTH IS THAT

01:06:03.893 --> 01:06:05.361
THE ONE THAT WE REALLY USE AS A

01:06:05.428 --> 01:06:07.830
BELLWETHER AS FAR AS HAS THIS

01:06:07.897 --> 01:06:08.931
AGENCY REALLY TAKEN THE

01:06:08.998 --> 01:06:10.666
RECOMMENDATION SERIOUSLY AND

01:06:10.733 --> 01:06:12.001

01:06:26.082 --> 01:06:28.217
LEASE PROPERTY OUT WHAT TERM

01:06:28.284 --> 01:06:29.318

01:06:29.385 --> 01:06:30.820
LANGUAGE OF THOSE LEASES WHO

01:06:30.886 --> 01:06:32.355

01:06:34.924 --> 01:06:36.158
VARIOUS HOME SO.

01:06:36.225 --> 01:06:37.026

01:06:37.093 --> 01:06:39.028
SIMILARITIES TO PRIOR --

01:06:39.095 --> 01:06:41.530
REVIEWS TWENTY THIRTEEN I MEAN

01:06:42.365 --> 01:06:44.100
AS FAR BACK AS TWO THOUSAND AND

01:06:44.166 --> 01:06:44.734
THREE WHEN WE LOOKED AT EMPLOYEE

WAS IN THERE.

01:06:51.574 --> 01:06:54.610
BUT I DO THINK THAT THERE IS.

01:06:54.677 --> 01:06:57.580
A DIFFERENT RESPONSE TO THIS

01:06:57.646 --> 01:07:00.683

ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS SO WE WILL

01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:14.330

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:22.371
ADAM.

01:07:22.438 --> 01:07:24.039
THE THOUGHT CAME TO MIND WHEN I

BUT I DO SEE SECRETARIES ARE

01:07:43.259 --> 01:07:44.860
JUST CURIOUS.

THE NEW GOVERNING SOME SO THEN.

01:08:17.259 --> 01:08:20.062
IS THERE A BETTER WAY TO RUN

01:08:20.129 --> 01:08:25.000
SOME OF THESE DEPARTMENTS --

01:08:25.067 --> 01:08:26.969
PORT CHARGES LOW IS IS THAT A

01:08:27.036 --> 01:08:30.272
RHETORICAL QUESTION.

NO CENTER I DON'T.

01:08:31.474 --> 01:08:33.309
COME OUT OF AN EXECUTIVE FOR

SESSIONS AND I'M IN LEGISLATIVE

01:08:34.343 --> 01:08:35.110

01:08:35.177 --> 01:08:36.212
MINUTES TO ASK YOU A QUESTION.

01:08:36.278 --> 01:08:37.179
AND AND AND BUT I'M LOOKING FOR

01:08:37.246 --> 01:08:40.783
SOLUTIONS RIGHT BECAUSE THIS IS

01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:41.217
EMBARRASSING STUFF.

01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:42.718
AND IT'S LIKE.

01:08:42.785 --> 01:08:44.119
MANAGEMENT FAILURE SO NOW WHAT

01:08:44.186 --> 01:08:45.788
WE DO.

01:08:45.855 --> 01:08:48.991
YOU KNOW IT IS HURT A WAY TO

01:08:49.058 --> 01:08:51.560
IMPROVE THIS WITH A C. O. O.

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:53.662
POSITION SOMEONE WHO COULD.

01:08:53.729 --> 01:08:54.263
SAY WHAT YOU'RE YOU'RE SHORT

01:08:54.330 --> 01:08:54.897
STAFFED OR YOU DON'T HAVE THE

01:08:54.964 --> 01:08:56.165
PROPER TRAINING WHAT WE'LL GET

01:08:56.232 --> 01:08:57.366
SOMEONE IN THERE FROM ANOTHER

01:08:57.433 --> 01:08:58.701
DEPARTMENT BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:08:58.767 --> 01:08:59.802
THEY'RE OVERSTAFFED.

01:08:59.869 --> 01:09:00.703
WERE WERE WHATEVER.

01:09:00.769 --> 01:09:02.705
AND I DON'T SEE THAT MECHANISM

01:09:02.771 --> 01:09:04.640
OR THAT OPPORTUNITY.

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:05.774
SO I'M JUST CURIOUS IF YOU EVER

01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:07.409
TRY TO LOOK AT THE THIRTY

01:09:07.476 --> 01:09:09.745
THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL AND SAID BOY

01:09:09.812 --> 01:09:11.247
HERE SOME IDEAS THAT WOULD.

01:09:11.313 --> 01:09:11.814
PREVENT.

01:09:11.881 --> 01:09:13.415
SOME OF THESE EMBARRASSING

01:09:13.482 --> 01:09:13.716
[inaudible]

01:09:13.782 --> 01:09:15.684
MANAGEMENT [inaudible]

01:09:15.751 --> 01:09:16.986
MISTAKES.

01:09:17.052 --> 01:09:18.254
WELL AND AND AND SOME OF THE

01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:19.655
THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE IN THE

01:09:19.722 --> 01:09:21.390
PAST AS AN AS A THE STATE

01:09:21.457 --> 01:09:22.892
AUDITOR'S OFFICE IN WORKING WITH

01:09:22.958 --> 01:09:24.994
YOU KNOW I'VE WORKED WITH FOR

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:25.995
FIVE DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATIONS

01:09:26.061 --> 01:09:26.729
NOW.

01:09:26.795 --> 01:09:28.898
IS BRIEFING THE AGENCY

01:09:28.964 --> 01:09:29.965
SECRETARIES.

01:09:30.032 --> 01:09:31.734
OF THE ISSUES WE'VE IDENTIFIED

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:33.469
IN AUDITS --

01:09:33.536 --> 01:09:34.303
I'VE OFFERED THAT TO EVERY

01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:36.071
ADMINISTRATION OF ALREADY MET

01:09:36.138 --> 01:09:37.673
WITH THE NEW ADMINISTRATION --

01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:38.574
THEY'RE VERY ATTENTIVE AND

01:09:38.641 --> 01:09:40.943
WANTING TO UNDER WE'VE

01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:42.611
IDENTIFIED IN THE PAST AND

01:09:42.678 --> 01:09:44.547
REALLY WANTING TO KNOW ARE THE

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:46.515
AGENCIES BEING RESPONSIVE ARE

01:09:46.582 --> 01:09:47.316
THE DEPARTMENT'S BEING

01:09:47.383 --> 01:09:49.151
RESPONSIVE TO YOUR YOUR

01:09:49.218 --> 01:09:51.086
RECOMMENDATION SO I THINK THAT

01:09:51.153 --> 01:09:51.387
WILL HELP.

01:09:51.453 --> 01:09:52.721
BUT I THINK THAT IT'S IT'S

01:09:52.788 --> 01:09:54.623
REALLY KEY AT THE CABINET LEVEL

01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:55.758
SO FOR EXAMPLE GOVERNMENT OFFICE

01:09:55.824 --> 01:09:56.959
HAS A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT

01:09:57.026 --> 01:09:58.527
DEPARTMENTS.

01:09:58.594 --> 01:10:00.029
THAT REPORTS TO IT.

01:10:00.095 --> 01:10:01.564
INDEED YES IS ONE OF THEM THERE

01:10:01.630 --> 01:10:03.032
ARE OTHERS SO WHAT WHAT'S

01:10:03.098 --> 01:10:04.767
HAPPENING AT THAT AGENCY LEVEL

01:10:04.833 --> 01:10:05.668
FOR THAT AGENCY TO REALLY

01:10:05.734 --> 01:10:07.102
UNDERSTAND.

01:10:07.169 --> 01:10:08.304
NOT JUST ISSUES AT THE STATE

01:10:08.370 --> 01:10:10.005
AUDITOR'S OFFICE RAISES BUT IF

01:10:10.072 --> 01:10:11.106
THERE ARE ISSUES RELATED TO

01:10:11.173 --> 01:10:13.108
BUDGET OR OTHER YOU KNOW --

01:10:13.175 --> 01:10:14.643
PROGRAM A LOT OF THESE

01:10:14.710 --> 01:10:16.011
DEPARTMENTS HAVE INTERNAL AUDIT

01:10:16.078 --> 01:10:17.746
SHOPS ARE THEY PAYING ATTENTION

01:10:17.813 --> 01:10:19.081
TO THE REVIEWS THAT THEIR OWN

01:10:19.148 --> 01:10:21.350
INTERNAL AUDITORS ARE DOING.

01:10:21.417 --> 01:10:22.685
I THINK AND AND YOU KNOW I DON'T

01:10:22.751 --> 01:10:23.919
I MEAN AUDITOR'S TYPICALLY ARE

01:10:23.986 --> 01:10:26.188
SKEPTICS AND AND VERY CRITICAL.

01:10:26.255 --> 01:10:28.757
BUT I DO REALLY WANT TO SAY THAT.

01:10:28.824 --> 01:10:30.759
THE THE CURRENT AGENCY SECRETARY

01:10:30.826 --> 01:10:32.161
OF VETERANS AFFAIRS HE REACHED

01:10:32.227 --> 01:10:33.362
OUT TO ME AS SOON AS A SITE WAS

01:10:33.429 --> 01:10:34.730
APPROVED YOU HAVE MY FULL

01:10:34.797 --> 01:10:36.532
COOPERATION I WANT YOU TO KNOW

01:10:36.599 --> 01:10:37.433
WE'RE GOING TO BE OUT THERE

01:10:37.499 --> 01:10:38.667
THESE HOMES GETTING AHEAD OF

01:10:38.734 --> 01:10:39.802
THIS WERE ALREADY TRYING TO

01:10:39.868 --> 01:10:41.303
IDENTIFY.

01:10:41.370 --> 01:10:43.272
WHAT LEASES WE HAVE --

01:10:43.339 --> 01:10:44.707
AND AND I DON'T KNOW I AM NOT TO

01:10:44.773 --> 01:10:46.075
SPEAK FOR HIM TO SAY HE WAS

01:10:46.141 --> 01:10:47.076
EMBARRASSED NOT TO BE ABLE TO

01:10:47.142 --> 01:10:49.244
NOW BUT HE WANTED TO GET ON TOP

01:10:49.311 --> 01:10:51.313
OF IT RIGHT AWAY AND I THINK.

01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:53.682
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A EXAMPLES

01:10:53.749 --> 01:10:55.050

01:10:55.117 --> 01:10:56.318
IMMEDIATELY TAKING CORRECTIVE

01:10:56.385 --> 01:10:57.853
ACTION NOT WAITING FOR REPORT TO

BE ISSUED AND THEN REACTING TO

01:11:00.155 --> 01:11:01.557
IT THEY ARE REACTING TO THE

01:11:01.624 --> 01:11:02.524
FEEDBACK.

01:11:02.591 --> 01:11:04.560
IMMEDIATELY AND AND AND I

01:11:04.627 --> 01:11:07.630

HERE.

01:11:19.375 --> 01:11:20.809
A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT.

01:11:20.876 --> 01:11:23.912
TAKE ON PERHAPS THIS IS THE SAME --

01:11:23.979 --> 01:11:25.948

DEPARTMENTS.

01:11:46.702 --> 01:11:48.404
AGAIN THAT'S A AYE AYE I THINK

01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:50.305
THERE'S A VARIETY OF OF

01:11:50.372 --> 01:11:51.507
OVERSIGHT OPPORTUNITIES THAT THE

01:11:51.573 --> 01:11:52.941
LEGISLATURE HAS CERTAINLY

01:11:53.008 --> 01:11:54.076
THROUGH THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE

01:11:54.143 --> 01:11:55.944
AUDIT COMMITTEE VARIOUS POLICY

01:11:56.011 --> 01:11:57.579

01:11:59.014 --> 01:12:01.016
OF HAVING THIS JOINT HEARING

01:12:01.083 --> 01:12:02.651
TODAY I THINK AND BUDGET SUB

01:12:02.718 --> 01:12:03.786
COMMITTEES THERE CAN BE

01:12:03.852 --> 01:12:05.587
QUESTIONS ASKED IN THE PAST MY

01:12:05.654 --> 01:12:08.190
OFFICE OFTENTIMES WOULD TESTIFY

01:12:08.257 --> 01:12:10.859
IT BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE HEARINGS --

01:12:10.926 --> 01:12:13.562
IF A DEPARTMENTS BUDGET WAS UP

01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:14.329
HE ASKED TO PRESENT HAVE YOU

01:12:14.396 --> 01:12:15.731
DONE AUDITS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:12:15.798 --> 01:12:17.166
VETERANS AFFAIRS IN THE LAST

01:12:17.232 --> 01:12:17.866
THREE YEARS.

01:12:17.933 --> 01:12:19.601
AND ARE YOU FEELING LIKE THE

01:12:19.668 --> 01:12:21.203
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE BEING FULLY

01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:22.971
IMPLEMENTED OR NOT AND IN SOME

01:12:23.038 --> 01:12:24.573
CASES IF THEY'RE NOT THEN THE

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:25.374
MEMBERS WOULD QUESTION THE

01:12:25.441 --> 01:12:26.341
DEPARTMENT.

01:12:26.408 --> 01:12:27.543
YOU'RE ASKING FOR MORE RESOURCES

01:12:27.609 --> 01:12:28.744
BUT THE AUDITOR IS SAYING YOU'RE

01:12:28.811 --> 01:12:30.813

01:12:33.716 --> 01:12:34.616
OF MECHANISMS THAT THE

AND THAT IT WE TRY TO TAKE THAT --

01:13:05.013 --> 01:13:07.082
SERIOUSLY AS FAR AS WE DON'T

01:13:07.149 --> 01:13:08.417

01:13:46.822 --> 01:13:47.823
ALLOWING.

01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:52.528
ME TO BE HERE TODAY --

01:13:52.594 --> 01:13:53.095
TO BECAUSE I THINK THOSE ARE

01:13:53.162 --> 01:13:54.763
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT HEARING --

01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:56.365
I DO HAVE SOME PREPARED REMARKS

01:13:56.431 --> 01:13:57.733
BECAUSE I I REALLY THINK THAT

01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:59.234
SOME OF THIS --

01:13:59.301 --> 01:14:01.270
NEEDS TO BE PUT INTO CONTEXT AND

01:14:01.336 --> 01:14:03.739
I HOPE THAT THIS IS HELPFUL.

01:14:03.806 --> 01:14:04.873
FIRST OF ALL AS A SENATOR

01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:05.707
REPRESENTING THE YACHT BILL

01:14:05.774 --> 01:14:07.376
THAT'S HOME THE CARE THE

01:14:07.442 --> 01:14:09.211
RESIDENTS IMPROPER MANAGEMENT OF

01:14:09.278 --> 01:14:10.312
THE FACILITY.

01:14:10.379 --> 01:14:13.282
IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANT TO ME --

01:14:13.348 --> 01:14:14.650
THE YOUR BILL VETERANS HOME HAS

01:14:14.716 --> 01:14:16.451
BEEN AN INCREDIBLY ENORMOUS

01:14:16.518 --> 01:14:19.488
ASSET FOR VETERANS --

01:14:19.555 --> 01:14:21.190
FOR WELL OVER A CENTURY IT'S

01:14:21.256 --> 01:14:23.225
BEEN A CRITICAL PARTNER --

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:24.059
TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES

01:14:24.126 --> 01:14:25.460
OF THE TOWN OF YACHT BILL AND

01:14:25.527 --> 01:14:26.862
THE BROADER NAPA VALLEY.

01:14:26.929 --> 01:14:28.297
WITH PROPER MANAGEMENT AND

01:14:28.363 --> 01:14:29.998
INVESTMENT I KNOW IT WILL

01:14:30.065 --> 01:14:33.168
CONTINUE TO MEET THOSE NEEDS --

01:14:33.235 --> 01:14:35.170
FOR THROUGH FOR THE NEXT CENTURY.

01:14:35.237 --> 01:14:38.140
WHAT'S CLEAR TIME HASN'T

01:14:38.207 --> 01:14:40.042
PROVIDED THE LEVEL OF DILIGENCE

01:14:40.108 --> 01:14:42.211
AND OVERSIGHT WE EXPECT FROM ALL

01:14:42.277 --> 01:14:43.679
OUR STATE DEPARTMENTS WITH

01:14:43.745 --> 01:14:46.882
RESPECT TO THE EVENTS IN LEASES.

01:14:46.949 --> 01:14:48.951
I DO FEEL HOWEVER THAT THE AUDIT

01:14:49.017 --> 01:14:51.653
OVERLOOK SOME OF THE BENEFITS.

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:53.655
OF THE VARIOUS LEASES --

01:14:53.722 --> 01:14:56.091
TO PROVIDE HOME RESIDENTS IN.

01:14:56.158 --> 01:14:57.793
THE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS MADE BY

01:14:57.860 --> 01:14:59.795
GROUPS TO BUILD RENOVATE OR

01:14:59.862 --> 01:15:01.797
MAINTAIN BUILDINGS AND AFTER

01:15:01.864 --> 01:15:04.233
LISTENING --

01:15:04.299 --> 01:15:06.268
TO THIS IS MISS HOUSE --

01:15:06.335 --> 01:15:08.871
TESTIMONY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

01:15:08.937 --> 01:15:11.106
SAY AT THIS POINT I PERHAPS --

01:15:11.173 --> 01:15:12.641
THEY WOULD'VE IF THEY'VE BEEN.

01:15:12.708 --> 01:15:14.209
YOU KNOW PUT IN THE LEASES WHAT

01:15:14.276 --> 01:15:16.845
THE BENEFITS WORSE I APPRECIATE --

01:15:16.912 --> 01:15:18.780
THAT CONTACTS BUT I THINK THAT

01:15:18.847 --> 01:15:20.282
THE THAT NEW ONCE IS IMPORTANT

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:23.452
BECAUSE CERTAINLY NOBODY'S GOING

01:15:23.518 --> 01:15:24.720
TO BUILD A GOLF COURSE.

01:15:24.786 --> 01:15:25.821
OR BUILDING MUSEUM.

01:15:25.888 --> 01:15:28.323
OR SIGNIFICANTLY INPUT MILLIONS

01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:30.192
OF DOLLARS INTO A THEATER FOR A

01:15:30.259 --> 01:15:32.027
FIVE YEAR LEASE.

01:15:32.094 --> 01:15:34.096
SO IMMEDIATELY THERE'S GOT TO BE

01:15:34.162 --> 01:15:37.099
SOMETHING IN THERE THAT ALLOWS

01:15:37.165 --> 01:15:39.134
FOR A INVESTMENTS FROM THE

01:15:39.201 --> 01:15:40.936
COMMUNITY WORKS VOWED TO BE --

01:15:41.003 --> 01:15:42.838
APPROPRIATE USE AND ALL

01:15:42.905 --> 01:15:46.642
ULTIMATELY BENEFIT VETERANS THE

01:15:46.708 --> 01:15:47.643
IT IN THAT REGARD.

01:15:47.709 --> 01:15:49.411
AND I THINK --

01:15:49.478 --> 01:15:50.012
THAT'S WHERE THE PRESENTATION

01:15:50.078 --> 01:15:53.248
WAS. FOR THE BEST INTERESTS OF

01:15:53.315 --> 01:15:54.349
THE HOMES.

01:15:54.416 --> 01:15:56.318
LONG TERM AND WHETHER OR NOT --

01:15:56.385 --> 01:15:57.753
THESE LEASES.

01:15:57.819 --> 01:15:58.921
AND THE AMOUNT OF RENT IS

01:15:58.987 --> 01:16:00.389
ACTUALLY COMING BACK TO BENEFIT

01:16:00.455 --> 01:16:02.257
THE VETERANS THEMSELVES AND SO I

01:16:02.324 --> 01:16:03.592
BELIEVE THAT WAS AN ISSUE

01:16:03.659 --> 01:16:06.194
IDENTIFIED SO FULLY. TO TO THAT

01:16:06.261 --> 01:16:06.695
POINT MISTER DOT YEAH I

01:16:06.762 --> 01:16:07.596
PERSONALLY GOT MISTER CHAIR AND

01:16:07.663 --> 01:16:08.497
I THINK THAT --

01:16:08.563 --> 01:16:12.901
REASONABLE PROCESS AND CRITERIA

01:16:12.968 --> 01:16:14.102
FOR THESE LEASES ANY BETTER.

01:16:14.169 --> 01:16:16.405
PERMITS I THINK ARE IMPORTANT --

01:16:16.471 --> 01:16:18.407
TO TO TO MAKE SURE THAT --

01:16:18.473 --> 01:16:19.508
NOT ONLY THAT --

01:16:19.574 --> 01:16:23.211
LOOK IT JUST GOES DOWN THIS WAY

01:16:23.278 --> 01:16:25.247
THEY ARE PART OF THE COMMUNITY

01:16:25.314 --> 01:16:26.081
IT USED TO BE LIKE WHEN I GREW

01:16:26.148 --> 01:16:26.815
UP.

01:16:26.882 --> 01:16:27.849
THE ONLY TIME WE EVER SAW

01:16:27.916 --> 01:16:30.085
VETERANS WITH THE PEOPLE WENT TO

01:16:30.152 --> 01:16:31.186
THE LOCAL BARS IN THE TOWN OF

01:16:31.253 --> 01:16:34.489
YOUR BILL AND THAT WAS IT.

01:16:34.556 --> 01:16:35.691
AND I TELL YOU TODAY IT IS A

01:16:35.757 --> 01:16:37.960
MUCH DIFFERENT SITUATION THERE

01:16:38.026 --> 01:16:39.494
MEMBERS OF OUR CENTRAL

01:16:39.561 --> 01:16:42.064
COMMITTEES THEY'RE INVOLVED IN

01:16:42.130 --> 01:16:44.399
SO MANY COMMUNITY EVENTS AND IT

01:16:44.466 --> 01:16:45.867
THING SO SOME OF THESE THINGS

01:16:45.934 --> 01:16:47.869
LIKE THE THEATER.

01:16:47.936 --> 01:16:49.905
AND THESE OTHER THINGS WERE A

01:16:49.972 --> 01:16:51.373
MAJOR INVESTMENTS ARE GOING ON

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:55.677
WE JUST HAVE TO HAVE SOME --

01:16:55.744 --> 01:16:58.981
COMMON SENSE PREVAIL. TO TO YOUR

01:16:59.047 --> 01:17:00.115
POINT IF IT'S JUST PUT IN THE

01:17:00.182 --> 01:17:01.750
LEAST AND SHOWN THE BENEFITS

01:17:01.817 --> 01:17:03.285
THAT'S PROBABLY --

01:17:03.352 --> 01:17:04.853
WHAT YOU NEED GOING FORWARD?

01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:06.922
BUT I I MY POINT IS WE CAN'T

01:17:06.989 --> 01:17:08.957
HAVE THE PENDULUM SWINGING FROM

01:17:09.024 --> 01:17:11.226
LAX OVERSIGHT TO SIMPLY SHUTTING

01:17:11.293 --> 01:17:13.228
DOWN THE COMMUNITY.

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:14.863
THE VETERANS HOME --

01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:15.630
AT THE HOME --

01:17:15.697 --> 01:17:17.065
WE WILL NOT BE THE VETERANS AT

01:17:17.132 --> 01:17:19.601
THE HOME WILL NOT BENEFIT BY

01:17:19.668 --> 01:17:20.969
BEINGS WALLED OFF FROM THE

01:17:21.036 --> 01:17:22.637
COMMUNITY AND THE TAXPAYERS NAPA

01:17:22.704 --> 01:17:25.173
VALLEY WILL NOT BENEFIT.

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:27.142
FROM BEING BARRED FROM OF THE

01:17:27.209 --> 01:17:29.411
CAMPUS. FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S AN

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:30.879
ANNUAL BIKE RACE THAT HAPPENS

01:17:30.946 --> 01:17:32.748
EVERY SINGLE YEAR THEY RAISE

01:17:32.814 --> 01:17:36.284
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS

01:17:36.351 --> 01:17:38.353
FOR VETERANS. FOR VETERANS NOW

01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:39.654
THAT WASN'T IN THE LEAST MAYBE

01:17:39.721 --> 01:17:41.223
THERE WASN'T EVEN A YOU KNOW AS

01:17:41.289 --> 01:17:43.225
A CONTRACTOR AND I GET THAT.

01:17:43.291 --> 01:17:44.593
BUT THIS WHAT I'M JUST CONCERNED

01:17:44.659 --> 01:17:47.662
ABOUT IS THE PENDULUM SWINGING

01:17:47.729 --> 01:17:48.463
YOUR THE WRONG WAY AND ALL THE

01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:50.565
SUDDEN MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY

01:17:50.632 --> 01:17:51.867
WHO HERETOFORE HAVE BEEN.

01:17:51.933 --> 01:17:54.870
MAJOR PROPONENTS OF THE VETERANS

01:17:54.936 --> 01:17:56.638
HOME AND SUPPORTERS THROUGHOUT

01:17:56.705 --> 01:17:58.707
THE COMMUNITY GET TURNED OFF TO

01:17:58.774 --> 01:18:00.242
THE STATE TURNED OFF THE

01:18:00.308 --> 01:18:02.210
VETERANS WHICH IS YOU KNOW EVEN

01:18:02.277 --> 01:18:04.413
WORSE THESE PEOPLE THAT SERVED --

01:18:04.479 --> 01:18:06.481
ON BEHALF OF OF THEIR COUNTRY

01:18:06.548 --> 01:18:08.316
BUT I THINK IT'LL BE WE NEED A

01:18:08.383 --> 01:18:09.618
COLLABORATIVE PROCESS TO GET CD

01:18:09.684 --> 01:18:11.820
DA WE'RE NEEDS TO BE.

01:18:11.887 --> 01:18:14.956
AND I LOOK FORWARD YOU ARE

01:18:15.023 --> 01:18:18.060
PARTNERING AN IDEA ON THIS ISSUE

01:18:18.126 --> 01:18:19.127

01:18:36.845 --> 01:18:38.046
WE DO THAT RESPONSIBLE YET

01:18:38.113 --> 01:18:39.681
OTHERS SOME GOOD PROGRAMS ARE

01:18:39.748 --> 01:18:41.116
HAPPENING OUT THERE BUT YOU KNOW

01:18:41.183 --> 01:18:42.417

DISMISSED WE DIDN'T DO MUCH

01:25:37.932 --> 01:25:39.133
ANALYSIS OF OF THOSE.

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:40.702
LAWSUITS OTHER THAN TO NOTE THAT

01:25:40.768 --> 01:25:43.271
IT IS INDICATIVE OF THE THE THE

01:25:43.338 --> 01:25:44.706
THE LIABILITY THAT THE STATE IS

01:25:44.772 --> 01:25:45.740
EXPOSED.

01:25:45.807 --> 01:25:47.375
TO SO ONE THING THAT WOULD BE OF

01:25:47.442 --> 01:25:49.010
USE TO ME AT LEAST IS IS SOME

01:25:49.077 --> 01:25:50.879
ANALYSIS AS TO WHAT HAS BEEN

01:25:50.945 --> 01:25:52.680
FILED WHAT HAS BEEN RESOLVED AND

01:25:52.747 --> 01:25:54.082

THERE'S BEEN CLAIMS THAT.

01:25:55.483 --> 01:25:57.185
HAVE BEEN ASSERTED BUT HAVE NOT

01:25:57.252 --> 01:25:58.486
BEEN FILED THAT KIND OF THING

01:25:58.553 --> 01:26:00.288
JUST SO WE HAVE A SENSE OF THE

01:26:00.355 --> 01:26:02.557
STATE'S EXPOSURE.

01:26:02.624 --> 01:26:04.859
AND AGAIN MAYBE THAT MAY BE BEST

01:26:04.926 --> 01:26:06.628
FOR THE FOR THE CALVET FOLKS BUT

01:26:06.694 --> 01:26:07.929
I'LL I'LL PUT THAT OUT THERE

01:26:07.996 --> 01:26:09.464
THEN THE SECOND IS DURING THE

01:26:09.531 --> 01:26:11.165
COURSE OF YOUR AUDIT DID WERE

01:26:11.232 --> 01:26:13.701
QUESTIONS S. LIKE WHY DO WHY DO

WE HAVE A RESERVOIR AT YON PHIL --

01:26:17.372 --> 01:26:17.805
AND IF SO WHAT WERE THE

01:26:17.872 --> 01:26:19.040
RESPONSES.

01:26:19.107 --> 01:26:20.675
SO WITH THE RESERVOIR WAS NOT

01:26:20.742 --> 01:26:21.976
AMONG THE LEASES THAT WE

01:26:22.043 --> 01:26:23.111
SELECTED FOR REVIEW.

01:26:23.177 --> 01:26:24.212
BECAUSE WHEN WE REVIEW THE

01:26:24.279 --> 01:26:25.747
AGREEMENT FOR THE RESERVOIR WE

01:26:25.813 --> 01:26:26.581
DETERMINED THAT IT WAS NOT A

01:26:26.648 --> 01:26:28.449
LEASE AND SO WE FOCUS OUR

01:26:28.516 --> 01:26:29.717
AIRCREW OF REVIEW ON THE

01:26:29.784 --> 01:26:31.286
AGREEMENTS THAT AND WE

01:26:31.352 --> 01:26:32.587

01:26:32.654 --> 01:26:33.955
OKAY.

01:26:34.022 --> 01:26:36.124
SO LET ME WHEN WE WHEN WE HAVE

01:26:36.190 --> 01:26:37.692
THINGS LIKE READ A SUPPOSE

01:26:37.759 --> 01:26:40.461
THAT'S FOR A FUTURE ANALYSIS AS

01:42:34.882 --> 01:42:37.651
SORT OF SQUATTING ON THE CAMPUS

01:42:37.718 --> 01:42:39.186

PHYSICIAN I WAS HIRED TO COME IN

01:42:50.697 --> 01:42:51.899
AND BRING THE EIGHT VETERANS

01:42:51.965 --> 01:42:54.368

PREDECESSORS --

01:43:01.041 --> 01:43:03.844
I FOUND ALL EIGHT HOMES TO BE OF

01:43:03.911 --> 01:43:05.379
MEDIOCRE QUALITY.

01:43:05.445 --> 01:43:08.248
THEY WERE AT TWO STARS NOT MY

01:43:08.315 --> 01:43:10.717
DECISION.

01:43:10.784 --> 01:43:12.953
AND I DEVOTED ALL OF MY SKILL

01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:16.823
EXPERTISE AND TIME AND ENERGY.

01:43:16.890 --> 01:43:19.259
TO CREATING A SYSTEM OF HOMES

01:43:19.326 --> 01:43:20.761
AND BY SYSTEMATIZING AND

01:43:20.827 --> 01:43:22.663
STANDARDIZING OPERATIONS ACROSS

01:43:22.729 --> 01:43:23.931
ALL THE HOMES THAT IMPROVE

01:43:23.997 --> 01:43:25.232
PATIENT SAFETY.

01:43:25.299 --> 01:43:27.701
AND INCREASED EFFICIENCY BUT

01:43:27.768 --> 01:43:30.103
ENABLED ME TO INCREASE THE

01:43:30.170 --> 01:43:32.139
QUALITY OF CARE DELIVERED TO

01:43:32.205 --> 01:43:33.373

I CAN HELP VERY HAPPILY TELL YOU

01:43:35.409 --> 01:43:38.078
NOW ALL EIGHT HOMES ARE IT FIVE

01:43:38.145 --> 01:43:39.746
STARS.

01:43:39.813 --> 01:43:41.448
AND WERE RECENTLY --

01:43:41.515 --> 01:43:43.650
CITED BY US NEWS AND WORLD

01:43:43.717 --> 01:43:45.352

AS AMONG THE TOP ONE HUNDRED

01:43:47.220 --> 01:43:49.189
NURSING FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA

01:43:49.256 --> 01:43:50.691
I'M VERY PROUD OF THAT I DIDN'T

01:43:50.757 --> 01:43:52.559
DO IT MY STAFF DID OKAY WE'VE

01:43:52.626 --> 01:43:55.062
GONE FROM TWO STARS TO FIVE STAR.

01:43:55.128 --> 01:43:56.430
WHEN THAT HAPPENED LATE LAST

01:43:56.496 --> 01:43:57.931
YEAR IT ENABLED THE FOR THE

01:43:57.998 --> 01:43:59.333
FIRST TIME IN MY TEN YEAR TO

01:43:59.399 --> 01:44:01.101
TURN MY ATTENTION TO THE MORE

01:44:01.168 --> 01:44:03.070
MUNDANE ASPECTS?

01:44:03.136 --> 01:44:04.304
OF THE BUSINESS.

01:44:04.371 --> 01:44:05.672
NOW I LOOK TO SOME OF THOSE

01:44:05.739 --> 01:44:07.841
LEASES WHEN I FIRST GOT HERE AND

01:44:07.908 --> 01:44:09.643
WAS -- I I'M

NOT A LAWYER AND I'M NOT A

01:44:10.811 --> 01:44:12.646
PROPERTY MANAGER BUT I WAS KIND

01:44:12.713 --> 01:44:14.214
OF SHOCKED BY THE TERMS OF THIS.

01:44:14.281 --> 01:44:16.283
I I WONDERED WHO HAD A GUN TO

01:44:16.350 --> 01:44:19.252
THEIR HEAD WHEN THEY SIGN THESE --

01:44:19.319 --> 01:44:19.987
BUT JOE.

01:44:20.053 --> 01:44:21.955
IN CONSULTATION WITH MY LAWYERS

01:44:22.022 --> 01:44:23.223
I DISCOVERED THAT SOME OF THEM

01:44:23.290 --> 01:44:24.591
WE COULD DEAL WITH AND SOME OF

01:44:24.658 --> 01:44:25.325
THEM WE COULDN'T.

01:44:25.392 --> 01:44:28.562
WHEN THE AUDIT STARTED AROUND

01:44:28.629 --> 01:44:31.298
THE CAMPUS ROOM BY ROOM AND I

01:44:31.365 --> 01:44:34.901
WAS ASTOUNDED AT WHAT WE FOUND --

01:44:34.968 --> 01:44:37.638
THE SEIU WAS USING THEM --

01:44:37.704 --> 01:44:39.506
ROOMS IN OUR HOLDEN BUILDING --

01:44:39.573 --> 01:44:41.108
FOR WHICH THEY PAID NO RENT --

01:44:41.174 --> 01:44:41.875
FOR YEARS --

01:44:41.942 --> 01:44:43.110
A MED TECH --

01:44:43.176 --> 01:44:44.578
REPAIR COMPANY WAS USING ROOMS

01:44:44.645 --> 01:44:47.414
NAPA COUNTY FOR THIRTY YEARS HAD

01:44:47.481 --> 01:44:49.683
BEEN USING THE OLD I SEE YOU

01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:50.917
WHICH WAS SET UP AS A NURSE

01:44:50.984 --> 01:44:53.387
TRAINING STATION FORGIVE ME WHEN

01:44:53.453 --> 01:44:54.955
I FIRST GOT HIRED AND WALK MY

01:44:55.022 --> 01:44:55.689
THAT.

01:44:55.756 --> 01:44:56.790
I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS PART OF

01:44:56.857 --> 01:44:58.692
THE VETERANS HOME IT NEVER

01:44:58.759 --> 01:45:00.694
DAWNED ON ME TO ACTUALLYINQUIRE

01:45:00.761 --> 01:45:04.498
WHAT WAS THE LEGAL UNDERPINNING

01:45:04.564 --> 01:45:05.666
OF THAT WHICH WAS.

01:45:05.732 --> 01:45:06.700
NINE WE'RE IN THE PROCESS WITH

01:45:06.767 --> 01:45:08.068
ALL FOUR OF I THINK I'VE NAME

01:45:08.135 --> 01:45:10.837

01:45:10.904 --> 01:45:12.272

01:45:20.247 --> 01:45:21.682
DISCOVERED A LOT.

01:45:21.748 --> 01:45:22.883
DURING THAT TIME AND ONE OF THE

01:45:22.949 --> 01:45:23.784
THINGS THAT WAS BROUGHT UP IN

01:45:23.850 --> 01:45:25.519
THE LAST PANEL WAS THE ISSUE OF

01:45:25.585 --> 01:45:27.454
LIABILITIES AND SO I KNOW FOR

01:45:27.521 --> 01:45:27.754
INSTANCE --

01:45:27.821 --> 01:45:28.722
THERE WAS.

01:45:28.789 --> 01:45:30.390
REPORTED INCIDENCES OF THE

01:45:30.457 --> 01:45:31.491
MEDIAN I BELIEVE IT WAS ALSO

01:45:31.558 --> 01:45:33.393
IDENTIFIED IN THE AUDITOR'S

01:45:33.460 --> 01:45:34.928
REPORTS FOR INSTANCE LIKE A NOT

01:45:34.995 --> 01:45:36.530
KNOWING THAT THERE WAS HOT AIR

01:45:36.596 --> 01:45:38.231
BALLOON LAUNCHES FROM THE GOLF

01:45:38.298 --> 01:45:39.499
COURSE FOR INSTANCE AND ONE WAS

01:45:39.566 --> 01:45:40.801
A LIABILITY ON THAT.

01:45:40.867 --> 01:45:42.436
BUT AS YOU --

01:45:42.502 --> 01:45:43.070
YOU ALSO MENTION NOW YOU HAVE A

01:45:43.136 --> 01:45:46.673

01:45:46.740 --> 01:45:48.942
AND COMPASS.

01:45:49.009 --> 01:45:49.576
YOU KNOW THE LIABILITY ISSUE AS

01:45:49.643 --> 01:45:51.311
WELL.

01:45:51.378 --> 01:45:53.480
ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO --

01:45:53.547 --> 01:45:54.614
THE ISSUE OF BALLOONS ON THE

01:45:54.681 --> 01:45:56.483
GOLF COURSE CAME UP AND I WENT

01:45:56.550 --> 01:45:57.684
OVER AND MET WITH THE GENTLEMAN

01:45:57.751 --> 01:45:59.186
THAT MANAGES SAID AND HE SAID

01:45:59.252 --> 01:46:00.454
WELL WE HAVE LIABILITY.

01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:02.322
WE ALSO HAVE A CONVERSATION OF

01:46:02.389 --> 01:46:03.924
OF THE FACT THAT --

01:46:03.990 --> 01:46:05.392
A JUNIOR ADMINISTRATOR AT THE

01:46:05.459 --> 01:46:06.827
AWFUL CAMPUS EIGHT YEARS AGO

01:46:06.893 --> 01:46:08.161
DECIDED IT WAS JUST TOO MUCH

01:46:08.228 --> 01:46:09.529
WORK FOR CALVET TO BE LOOKING

01:46:09.596 --> 01:46:11.765
INTO HIS BOOKS. TO FIGURE OUT

01:46:11.832 --> 01:46:12.766
THE THE PROFIT SHARING

01:46:12.833 --> 01:46:14.401
ARRANGEMENTS SO SHE SAID SHE

01:46:14.468 --> 01:46:15.769
SAID TO THE GOLF COURSE WILL

01:46:15.836 --> 01:46:17.304
JUST CUT US A CHECK EACH MONTH

01:46:17.370 --> 01:46:18.271
AND THAT'LL BE FINE.

01:46:18.338 --> 01:46:19.172
SO -- I

01:46:19.239 --> 01:46:20.640

01:46:37.357 --> 01:46:39.126
IN OUR OPINION IF I MAY ANY USE

01:46:39.192 --> 01:46:40.627

01:50:35.996 --> 01:50:36.496
WOULD ASSUME THAT WAS THE

01:50:36.563 --> 01:50:37.864
OPERATING AUTHORITY THAT THE

01:50:37.931 --> 01:50:39.332
LEASE WAS ENTERED INTO --

01:50:39.399 --> 01:50:41.301
AND AND WHICH CASE IT WOULD HAVE

01:50:41.368 --> 01:50:41.901

AND TO BE FAIR AND IMPARTIAL

01:52:36.116 --> 01:52:37.550
THAT WE NEED TO TIGHTEN SOME

01:52:37.617 --> 01:52:38.985
STATUTORY AND REGULATORY

01:52:39.052 --> 01:52:40.487
LOOPHOLES.

01:52:40.553 --> 01:52:43.189
HOME I'LL BE CAREFUL NOT TO

01:52:43.256 --> 01:52:43.656
TREAD -- IN

01:52:43.723 --> 01:52:47.260
T. YOUR YOUR AREA OF EXPERTISE --

01:52:47.327 --> 01:52:48.995
THAT LET'S BE HONEST THIS IS THE

01:52:49.062 --> 01:52:50.330
OLDEST AND LARGEST VETERANS

01:52:50.396 --> 01:52:53.600
CEMETERY IN THE COUNTRY --

01:52:53.666 --> 01:52:54.534
THE ASSEMBLY.

01:52:54.601 --> 01:52:56.736
VETERANS HOME AND THE CEMETERY

01:52:56.803 --> 01:52:58.938
AT THE TOP THERE IS --

01:52:59.005 --> 01:53:00.840
IS REALLY THE OLDEST SON AND

01:53:00.907 --> 01:53:02.242
VERY VULNERABLE AND HAS --

01:53:02.308 --> 01:53:04.611
CIVIL WARVETERANS VETERANS OF

01:53:04.677 --> 01:53:06.513
THE MEXICAN AMERICAN WAR.

01:53:06.579 --> 01:53:07.547
THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:53:07.614 --> 01:53:08.581
MADE --

01:53:08.648 --> 01:53:10.283
THROUGH THE GENEROSITY OF THE

01:53:10.350 --> 01:53:12.552
PEOPLE IN THE TOWN AND COMMUNITY

01:53:12.619 --> 01:53:13.820
IS --

01:53:13.887 --> 01:53:15.455
PROBABLY NON PER I'LL IT'S

01:53:15.522 --> 01:53:17.390
EXTRAORDINARY AND IT CEMENTS THE

01:53:17.457 --> 01:53:19.626
RELATIONSHIP I THINK BETWEEN.

01:53:19.692 --> 01:53:24.464
THE HOME AND THE COMMUNITY ALSO

01:53:24.531 --> 01:53:26.065
THE MORE VOTING MEMBERS.

01:53:26.132 --> 01:53:27.901
I THINK THEY MAKE UP ONE THIRD

01:53:27.967 --> 01:53:28.902
OF THE ELECTORATE IN THE OUT

01:53:28.968 --> 01:53:29.435
FILL.

01:53:29.502 --> 01:53:33.239
AND IT'S NOT MY WISH THAT THOSE

01:53:33.306 --> 01:53:37.043
LARGE IMPROVEMENTS GO AWAY --

01:53:37.110 --> 01:53:38.344
WILL HAVE MORE TO SAY THAT WHEN

01:53:38.411 --> 01:53:41.714
WE GET TO THE MASTER PLAN --

01:53:41.781 --> 01:53:43.283
POSSIBLY AT THE END OF THIS YEAR.

01:53:43.349 --> 01:53:44.951
BUT LET ME SAY THAT --

01:53:45.018 --> 01:53:45.618
FOR EXAMPLE --

01:53:45.685 --> 01:53:47.820
YOU KNOW WE WE ASSESS THE MUSEUM

01:53:47.887 --> 01:53:50.023
OF RENT OF FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS

01:53:50.089 --> 01:53:51.157
A MONTH.

01:53:51.224 --> 01:53:54.027
IN.

01:53:54.093 --> 01:53:55.161
NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THAT RENT

01:53:55.228 --> 01:53:56.796
OVER THIRTY ONE YEARS HAS HAS

01:53:56.863 --> 01:53:59.832
RISEN TO THE BREATHTAKINGLY --

01:53:59.899 --> 01:54:00.600
HIGH --

01:54:00.667 --> 01:54:03.269
NUMBER OF FIVE HUNDRED AND

01:54:03.336 --> 01:54:04.904
EIGHTY THREE DOLLARS AND THIRTY

01:54:04.971 --> 01:54:08.341
THREE CENTS A MONTH --

01:54:08.408 --> 01:54:09.542
SO.

01:54:09.609 --> 01:54:12.078
I I DON'T WANT.

01:54:12.145 --> 01:54:13.179
TO I'M NOT IN THE LOOKING TO PUT

01:54:13.246 --> 01:54:14.447
ANY WHILE BUSINESS SIX EXCEPT

01:54:14.514 --> 01:54:16.282
POSSIBLY PASSED THE BALLOONS TO

01:54:16.349 --> 01:54:18.618
MOVE DOWN THE ROAD A BIT --

01:54:18.685 --> 01:54:21.654
BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME THAT

01:54:21.721 --> 01:54:24.424
SOME OF THESE ACTIVITIES HAVE.

01:54:24.490 --> 01:54:26.559
ABSOLUTE TANGIBLE BENEFITS TO

01:54:26.626 --> 01:54:28.895
THE VETERANS FOR EXAMPLE --

01:54:28.962 --> 01:54:30.096
WE USED TO HAVE AN ARRANGEMENT

01:54:30.163 --> 01:54:31.197
WITH THE THEATER THAT THE

01:54:31.264 --> 01:54:32.799
VETERANS WERE GIVEN A FREE

01:54:32.865 --> 01:54:34.467
TICKETS AND THAT WAS RE

01:54:34.534 --> 01:54:36.936
NEGOTIATED A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO

01:54:37.003 --> 01:54:38.471
SO THAT.

01:54:38.538 --> 01:54:41.608
NOW EFFECTIVELY BUT LET'S TAKE A

01:54:41.674 --> 01:54:43.543
TAKE THE LAST THREE YEARS WE

01:54:43.610 --> 01:54:44.877

01:54:47.847 --> 01:54:48.881

01:54:48.948 --> 01:54:50.416
BUT WE HAVE PAID THE LINCOLN

01:54:50.483 --> 01:54:54.387
THEATRE --

01:54:54.454 --> 01:54:56.022

I'M CHARGED OF A FEE OF JUST SHY

01:55:13.373 --> 01:55:15.141

01:55:15.208 --> 01:55:16.709
HAD TO CANCEL THAT.

THAT CONCERT FOR THE LAST TWO

01:55:18.378 --> 01:55:19.412
YEARS.

01:55:19.479 --> 01:55:22.448
WE CLEARLY HAVE WORK TO DO WITH

01:55:22.515 --> 01:55:24.817
THE MANAGEMENT OF THE MUSEUM AND

01:55:24.884 --> 01:55:26.352
THE THEATER THE THEATER

01:55:26.419 --> 01:55:28.187
MANAGEMENT HAS BEEN --

01:55:28.254 --> 01:55:31.190
EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT FOR ME

01:55:31.257 --> 01:55:33.092
TO WORK WITH.

01:55:33.159 --> 01:55:34.727
YEAH THAT SEEMS --

01:55:34.794 --> 01:55:35.895
VERY DISHEARTENING AND I WAS

01:55:35.962 --> 01:55:37.463

01:56:10.029 --> 01:56:12.565
THIS IS A COMMON REFRAIN IN THE

01:56:12.632 --> 01:56:14.500
IN HIS HOUSE --

01:56:14.567 --> 01:56:15.902
AS TO MONNING --

01:56:15.968 --> 01:56:17.103
WE WEREN'T AROUND AT THAT TIME

01:56:17.170 --> 01:56:18.171
WE'RE NOT SURE WHY IT WAS

01:56:18.237 --> 01:56:20.707
NEGOTIATED AWAY IN.

01:56:20.773 --> 01:56:21.641
TWENTY TWELVE IT'S SO I CAN

01:56:21.708 --> 01:56:22.975
CERTAINLY SAY SOME FORTUNE AS A

01:56:23.042 --> 01:56:24.143
SECTOR SAYING --

01:56:24.210 --> 01:56:25.778
THAT ALLOW THIS BENEFITS TO OUR

01:56:25.845 --> 01:56:28.181
RESIDENTS WERE ELIMINATED --

01:56:28.247 --> 01:56:29.749
BUT WE'RE NOT AWARE OF THERE'S

01:56:29.816 --> 01:56:31.551
THERE'S NO DOCUMENTATION EXPLAIN

01:56:31.617 --> 01:56:34.220
WHY THE DECISION WAS MADE.

01:56:34.287 --> 01:56:38.391
OR WHY THIS ONE IS BENEFITS

01:56:38.458 --> 01:56:38.825
WOULD BE GIVEN UP --

01:56:38.891 --> 01:56:40.326
SPASO AS PART OF A AS

01:56:40.393 --> 01:56:40.960

THAT BEEN NEGOTIATED THAT YEAR

01:56:41.961 --> 01:56:43.396
BUT AGAIN THE DETAILS CERTAIN

01:56:43.463 --> 01:56:44.864
UNFORTUNATELY LOST TO US AT THIS

01:56:44.931 --> 01:56:45.898
TIME.

01:56:45.965 --> 01:56:46.566
IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME

01:56:46.632 --> 01:56:47.633
OF 10% OF THE SEATS WERE SET

01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:49.702
ASIDE FOR VETERANS AND THEIR

01:56:49.769 --> 01:56:51.003
MEMBERS --

01:56:51.070 --> 01:56:52.772
WHY WE WOULD NEGOTIATE THAT

01:56:52.839 --> 01:56:54.540
BENEFIT AWAY FOR VETERANS?

01:56:54.607 --> 01:56:56.209
AND YOU KNOW ADDITIONALLY TO

01:56:56.275 --> 01:56:58.277
YOUR POINT MR AMBOS COUNTY YOU

01:56:58.344 --> 01:56:59.245
KNOW.

01:56:59.312 --> 01:57:01.047
BEING A GOOD PARTNER IF YOU

01:57:01.114 --> 01:57:02.615
WANTED A HOST EVENTS FOR

01:57:02.682 --> 01:57:03.149
VETERANS AND YOU'RE BEING

01:57:03.216 --> 01:57:05.017
CHARGED.

FULL PRICE WHEN [inaudible]

01:57:05.952 --> 01:57:07.620
YEP.

01:57:07.687 --> 01:57:08.488
THIS ARRANGEMENT IS ACTUALLY

01:57:08.554 --> 01:57:10.490
COSTING YOU MORE MONEY THAN IT

01:57:10.556 --> 01:57:12.291
IS ACTUALLY BENEFITING ANY OF

01:57:12.358 --> 01:57:12.959
THE VETERANS.

01:57:13.025 --> 01:57:14.093
WITH A POINT TO A NUMBER OF

01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:15.561
THESE AGREEMENTS WITH THESE LONG

01:57:15.628 --> 01:57:16.963
TERM LEASES --

01:57:17.029 --> 01:57:17.864
ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS I WAS

01:57:17.930 --> 01:57:19.599
LOOKING AT ALSO WAS A EVEN WITH

01:57:19.665 --> 01:57:20.933
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WHERE THEY

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.035
CHARGE CAL THAT SEVEN HUNDRED

01:57:23.102 --> 01:57:24.570
AND THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS.

01:57:24.637 --> 01:57:25.805
BUT YET TGS WAVE THE THIRTY

01:57:25.872 --> 01:57:28.207
THOUSAND DOLLARS THE THAT THEY

01:57:28.274 --> 01:57:29.942
WOULD.

01:57:30.009 --> 01:57:31.177
THAT THEY WOULD CHARGE THEM I

01:57:31.244 --> 01:57:32.178
DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO

01:57:32.245 --> 01:57:33.713
COMMENT ON THAT OR MAYBE D. G.

01:57:33.780 --> 01:57:35.381
S. CAN COMMENT ON THAT.

01:57:35.448 --> 01:57:38.351
BUT IT'S SEVEN THIRTY AND THIRTY

01:57:38.418 --> 01:57:38.985
THOUSAND DOLLAR WAY WHEN THEY'RE

01:57:39.051 --> 01:57:39.585
CHARGING YOU.

01:57:39.652 --> 01:57:41.154
YOU KNOW THREE QUARTERS OF A

01:57:41.220 --> 01:57:43.089
MILLION DOLLARS --

01:57:43.156 --> 01:57:44.891
DOESN'T SEEM APPROPRIATE.

01:57:44.957 --> 01:57:46.793
YEAH AND AND THIS IS WHERE AS

01:57:46.859 --> 01:57:49.462
SECRETARY SAID THAT REFRAIN OF

01:57:49.529 --> 01:57:51.063
THE POOR DOCUMENTATION AND NO

01:57:51.130 --> 01:57:51.998
ONE BEING AROUND MAKES IT

01:57:52.064 --> 01:57:53.366
DIFFICULT --

01:57:53.433 --> 01:57:55.935
I MEAN THE THERE IS THERE IS THE

01:57:56.002 --> 01:57:57.870
ORAL HISTORY I'LL SAY IT THAT

01:57:57.937 --> 01:57:59.071
WAY -- BUT

01:57:59.138 --> 01:58:00.339
WHETHER THAT ACTUALLY IS IS I

01:58:00.406 --> 01:58:01.874
COULD NOT A DIFFERENT STORY --

01:58:01.941 --> 01:58:03.443
SO AND ALL THAT BUT AT THE RISK

01:58:03.509 --> 01:58:04.477
OF SOUNDING WILL SPECULATIVE I

01:58:04.544 --> 01:58:06.345
MEAN GOING BACK TO THE FIRST

01:58:06.412 --> 01:58:07.313
POINT YOU MADE ABOUT THE

01:58:07.380 --> 01:58:08.414
RENEGOTIATION OF THE THE TICKETS

01:58:08.481 --> 01:58:09.982
WILL.

01:58:10.049 --> 01:58:11.317
TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE OPERATOR

01:58:11.384 --> 01:58:12.885
OF THE THEATER WENT BANKRUPT AND

01:58:12.952 --> 01:58:13.386
SO THERE'S A BANKRUPTCY

01:58:13.453 --> 01:58:14.420
PROCEEDING THERE'S A SETTLEMENT

01:58:14.487 --> 01:58:16.422
NEGOTIATION THEIR ORAL HISTORY

01:58:16.489 --> 01:58:18.524
IS THAT PART OF THAT --

01:58:18.591 --> 01:58:20.293
NEGOTIATION OR TO MAKE IT MORE

01:58:20.359 --> 01:58:22.061
PROFITABLE TO RUN THEY NEEDED TO

01:58:22.128 --> 01:58:23.296
MAXIMIZE REVENUE AND SO THE

01:58:23.362 --> 01:58:25.198
OTHERS THOSE LITTLE TINY TIDBITS

01:58:25.264 --> 01:58:26.098
OF HANDS THAT WHETHER THAT WAS A

01:58:26.165 --> 01:58:27.834
JUSTIFIABLE DECISION WHEN I WAS

01:58:27.900 --> 01:58:28.701
REALLY JUST SORT OF WENT WITH

01:58:28.768 --> 01:58:29.769
THAT ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENED A

01:58:29.836 --> 01:58:31.270
LITTLE HARD TO TELL --

01:58:31.337 --> 01:58:34.240
AS IT RELATES TO THE THE THE

01:58:34.307 --> 01:58:35.208
FIRE TRAINING YOU KNOW ABOUT THE

01:58:35.274 --> 01:58:37.109
AGAIN ORAL HISTORY IS THAT THERE

01:58:37.176 --> 01:58:39.178
THERE IS A IT'S MEANT TO BE AN

01:58:39.245 --> 01:58:40.546
OFFSET ULTIMATELY AGAINST WHAT

01:58:40.613 --> 01:58:41.581
WITH THE STATE WOULD NORMALLY

01:58:41.647 --> 01:58:42.849
PAY FOR SOME OF THOSE FIRE

01:58:42.915 --> 01:58:44.984
PROTECTION SERVICES --

01:58:45.051 --> 01:58:48.588
BUT AGAIN IT'S IT'S THIS IS THIS

01:58:48.654 --> 01:58:52.158
IS ALL THE MINUTE ANSWERS WHAT

01:58:52.225 --> 01:58:53.893
HAPPENED BACK THEN WHEN THOSE

01:58:53.960 --> 01:58:58.631
THINGS WERE NEGOTIATED.

01:58:58.698 --> 01:59:00.266
YEAH I JUST IT'S IT'S SHOCKING

01:59:00.333 --> 01:59:01.300
BECAUSE SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF

01:59:01.367 --> 01:59:03.769
THESE WE NEGOTIATIONS ARE THESE

01:59:03.836 --> 01:59:05.004
AMENDMENTS OBVIOUSLY --

01:59:05.071 --> 01:59:06.672
BENEFIT THE BUSINESS VENDORS AT

01:59:06.739 --> 01:59:09.342
THE EXPENSE OF OTHER VETERANS OF

01:59:09.408 --> 01:59:10.843
THE HOMES AND YOU KNOW WE KNOW

01:59:10.910 --> 01:59:11.477
THAT YOUNG FILL IN THESE HOMES

01:59:11.544 --> 01:59:14.547
RE DESIGNATED TO BE PRIMARILY --

01:59:14.614 --> 01:59:16.315
SERVICING VETERANS AND SO AS WE

01:59:16.382 --> 01:59:17.984
CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD HOW DO

01:59:18.050 --> 01:59:20.853
WE RENEGOTIATE THESE --

01:59:20.920 --> 01:59:22.822
LONG TERM LEASES SO THAT THEY DO

01:59:22.889 --> 01:59:23.990
BENEFITS --

01:59:24.056 --> 01:59:25.258
ORAL TO GO WHICH IS SERVING

01:59:25.324 --> 01:59:26.392
VETERANS.

01:59:26.459 --> 01:59:27.894
AND A YOU KNOW I I AM A LITTLE

01:59:27.960 --> 01:59:29.328
DISHEARTENED WHEN HERE FIFTY

01:59:29.395 --> 01:59:31.130
YEAR LEASES I I GET THE CAPITAL

01:59:31.197 --> 01:59:33.799
COSTS AND MAKING THAT PLAY OUT

01:59:33.866 --> 01:59:38.704
BUT WHEN THOSE BUSINESS VENDORS

01:59:38.771 --> 01:59:39.539
ARE --

01:59:39.605 --> 01:59:40.573
PULLING BACK FROM OFFERING YOU

01:59:40.640 --> 01:59:42.575
KNOW 10% OF THEIR AVAILABLE

01:59:42.642 --> 01:59:44.143
SPACE IN THE THEATER OR FREE

01:59:44.210 --> 01:59:46.579
ADMISSION AT THE MUSEUM.

01:59:46.646 --> 01:59:48.414
YOU KNOW.

01:59:48.481 --> 01:59:50.082
IT DOESN'T SEEM VERY BENEFICIAL

01:59:50.149 --> 01:59:51.150
FOR THE VETERANS ARE FOR THE

01:59:51.217 --> 01:59:52.518
STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHEN WE'RE

01:59:52.585 --> 01:59:54.353
ASSUMING ALL THE LIABILITY FOR

01:59:54.420 --> 01:59:57.089
THIS MOVING FORWARD --

01:59:57.156 --> 01:59:58.457
I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

01:59:58.524 --> 01:59:59.525
IMPROVEMENT THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:59:59.592 --> 02:00:01.327
DONE AND YOU KNOW I KNOW YOU

02:00:01.394 --> 02:00:02.662
GUYS COMMENTED IS.

02:00:02.728 --> 02:00:04.196
A LITTLE ON SOME OF THE THE

02:00:04.263 --> 02:00:06.165
PROCEDURAL THINGS THAT YOU WERE

02:00:06.232 --> 02:00:07.300
DOING THE POLICIES AT YOUR

02:00:07.366 --> 02:00:08.568
EMPLOYMENT IN BUT WHAT

02:00:08.634 --> 02:00:10.403
ADDITIONALLY TO WE NEED TO DO TO

02:00:10.469 --> 02:00:11.904
HELP ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE

02:00:11.971 --> 02:00:13.039
BEST INTERESTS OF VETERANS

02:00:13.105 --> 02:00:14.740
MOVING FORWARD.

02:00:14.807 --> 02:00:16.542
HOW CAN THE STATE ON OUR SIDE AS

02:00:16.609 --> 02:00:18.344
LEGISLATORS WHETHER THAT'S DONE

02:00:18.411 --> 02:00:19.345
THROUGH STATUTE AND THEN WAS OR

02:00:19.412 --> 02:00:20.379
WHEN WAS TALKING ABOUT A COUPLE

02:00:20.446 --> 02:00:21.781
OF GOVERNMENT CODES?

02:00:21.847 --> 02:00:24.016
HOW CAN WE DO WHAT WE DO ON OUR

02:00:24.083 --> 02:00:26.552
SITE ACTUALLY HELP YOU --

02:00:26.619 --> 02:00:29.255
WITH BECAUSE THAT WE HAVE PLEASE

02:00:29.322 --> 02:00:33.492
YOU COULD THE P. --

02:00:33.559 --> 02:00:36.062
TO TO ACQUIRE A SMALL AUDIT --

02:00:36.128 --> 02:00:37.964
UNIT IN CALVET --

02:00:38.030 --> 02:00:38.598
THAT -- THEY

02:00:38.664 --> 02:00:40.399
WOULD BE ABLE --

02:00:40.466 --> 02:00:41.968
TO IT'S IN THE BUDGET --

02:00:42.034 --> 02:00:43.469
WE WOULD BE ABLE --

02:00:43.536 --> 02:00:44.904
TO BEFORE WARNED OF SOME OF

02:00:44.971 --> 02:00:47.306
THESE ISSUES AND WOULD BE ABLE --

02:00:47.373 --> 02:00:49.742
TO BETTER ABLE AS PER THE ORDERS

02:00:49.809 --> 02:00:52.278
REQUEST OF US TO RIDE HERD OVER

02:00:52.345 --> 02:00:54.447
WITH THE PROPERTIES THAT WERE

02:00:54.513 --> 02:00:55.281
MANAGING.

02:00:55.348 --> 02:00:57.149
ON THAT WOULD BE AT THAT WOULD

02:00:57.216 --> 02:00:58.684
BE AN ENORMOUS HELP TO ME.

02:00:58.751 --> 02:01:00.119
SO WE WILL LOOK INTO THAT AND

02:01:00.186 --> 02:01:01.921
THEN I KNOW MR VOTE VOEPEL IN

02:01:01.988 --> 02:01:04.123
THE THE PREVIOUS PANEL ACTUALLY

02:01:04.190 --> 02:01:05.925
ASKED ABOUT POTENTIAL LITIGATION

02:01:05.992 --> 02:01:07.393
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT.

02:01:07.460 --> 02:01:10.529
THE DEPARTMENT WOULD ENTERTAIN

02:01:10.596 --> 02:01:12.498
KIND OF MOVING FORWARD AS WELL.

02:01:12.565 --> 02:01:12.832
WITH THESE --

02:01:12.898 --> 02:01:14.400
BUSINESS MATTERS.

02:01:14.467 --> 02:01:15.401
I I'M I'M SORRY I I YOU'RE

02:01:15.468 --> 02:01:17.536
REFERRING TO AT LITIGATION TO TO

02:01:17.603 --> 02:01:18.971
TERMINATE --

02:01:19.038 --> 02:01:21.641
TERMINATOR JUST AMEND OKAY --

02:01:21.707 --> 02:01:22.575
YES WHICH SAYS A SECTOR

02:01:22.642 --> 02:01:23.643
MENTIONED WE ARE WE'RE WORKING

02:01:23.709 --> 02:01:25.444
WITH TGS TO SEE WHAT OUR OPTIONS

02:01:25.511 --> 02:01:28.314
WHAT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO US.

02:01:28.381 --> 02:01:29.749
TO TERMINATE IN AND IN THOSE

02:01:29.815 --> 02:01:31.617
CASES WHERE WE CAN --

02:01:31.684 --> 02:01:36.689
AND RENEGOTIATE AND OTHER KEY.

02:01:36.756 --> 02:01:38.924
OBVIOUSLY THE WILLINGNESS OF THE

02:01:38.991 --> 02:01:41.794
THE LASSIES --

02:01:41.861 --> 02:01:42.828
IN.

02:01:42.895 --> 02:01:43.863
EIGHT JUST BECAUSE JUST BECAUSE

02:01:43.929 --> 02:01:46.065
TODAY WE DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE

02:01:46.132 --> 02:01:47.800
WITH THE THE TERMS ARE RENTAL

02:01:47.867 --> 02:01:49.402
RATES FOR ANY OF THOSE ASPECTS

02:01:49.468 --> 02:01:50.803
DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN IT'S

02:01:50.870 --> 02:01:52.972
NOT A VALID AGREEMENT --

02:01:53.039 --> 02:01:55.174
THAT WE WE MAY BE BOUND TO FIVE

02:01:55.241 --> 02:01:56.208
AGAIN THAT'S PART OF THE

02:01:56.275 --> 02:01:57.209
RESEARCH THAT WE'RE DOING TO

02:01:57.276 --> 02:01:58.444
FIND OUT --

02:01:58.511 --> 02:02:00.713
TO I I BELIEVE IT WAS --

02:02:00.780 --> 02:02:01.280
ONE OF THAT WHEN THEY ALLEGE

02:02:01.347 --> 02:02:01.614
THIS POINT --

02:02:01.681 --> 02:02:02.948
TO SEE IF THERE'S IF THERE'S A

02:02:03.015 --> 02:02:05.451
POTENTIAL WAY TO AVOID THE

02:02:05.518 --> 02:02:06.085
AGREEMENT OR CHANGE IN SOME WAY

02:02:06.152 --> 02:02:07.386
ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE AGREEMENTS

02:02:07.453 --> 02:02:08.821
ARE TAKING AWAY BENEFITS

02:02:08.888 --> 02:02:11.023
BENEFITS FROM VETERANS --

02:02:11.090 --> 02:02:12.058
WITH LIKE WE TALKED BUT I NEVER

02:02:12.124 --> 02:02:13.592
SIR WHAT HAS ONE ADDITIONAL

02:02:13.659 --> 02:02:18.330
QUESTION THE REMOVED TO CENTER

02:02:18.397 --> 02:02:21.534
ARCH LETTER THAN TO SENATOR DODD --

02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:22.735
REMEMBER THAT I GUESS I COULDN'T

02:02:22.802 --> 02:02:24.003
MAKE IT KIND OF LIKE I DID HAVE

02:02:24.070 --> 02:02:24.870
A BILL ON THE AUDITOR AND

02:02:24.937 --> 02:02:27.173
PERHAPS WE CAN.

02:02:27.239 --> 02:02:27.606
TRY THAT ONE AGAIN.

02:02:27.673 --> 02:02:30.609
OF SO -- ONE

02:02:30.676 --> 02:02:31.744
OF THE DISTURBING THINGS ABOUT

02:02:31.811 --> 02:02:32.645
TRYING TO REMEMBER EVERYTHING

02:02:32.712 --> 02:02:35.147
THROUGH HORRELL ORAL HISTORY IS --

02:02:35.214 --> 02:02:36.215
YOU KNOW AS SOON AS THOSE PEOPLE

02:02:36.282 --> 02:02:37.683
LEFT WE HAVE NO IDEA REALLY WHAT

02:02:37.750 --> 02:02:39.418
HAPPENS SO HOPEFULLY GOING

02:02:39.485 --> 02:02:40.653
FORWARD WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING

02:02:40.720 --> 02:02:42.188
ABOUT PUTTING POLICIES IN PLACE

02:02:42.254 --> 02:02:43.355
BUT ALSO.

02:02:43.422 --> 02:02:44.924
MAKING SURE THAT THE RECORD

02:02:44.990 --> 02:02:46.125
KEEPING IS --

02:02:46.192 --> 02:02:48.527
ACCURATE AND YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT

02:02:48.594 --> 02:02:51.931
HAPPENED AND TWENTY TWELVE THAT

02:02:51.997 --> 02:02:54.834
YOU TOOK AWAY THAT THAT VETERANS

02:02:54.900 --> 02:02:55.735
BECAUSE THE COMPANY RUNNING

02:02:55.801 --> 02:02:58.471
THEATER DECLARED BANKRUPTCY.

02:02:58.537 --> 02:02:59.739
BUT THE WORLD MY UNDERSTANDING

02:02:59.805 --> 02:03:01.507
IS THERE WAS ALSO A BIG STATE

02:03:01.574 --> 02:03:04.210
INVESTMENTS A FEW YEARS BEFORE

02:03:04.276 --> 02:03:06.612
TO TRY TO KEEP THE ORDER SOLVE

02:03:06.679 --> 02:03:11.517
IT IS THAT ACCURATE.

02:03:11.584 --> 02:03:12.051
YEAH.

02:03:12.118 --> 02:03:13.953
THAT'S GOING BACK INTO OUR

02:03:14.019 --> 02:03:17.356
HISTORY AND I'M A LITTLE ON THAT.

02:03:17.423 --> 02:03:18.491
I WAS IT WAS --

02:03:18.557 --> 02:03:19.125
TWO THOUSAND FOUR BUT THE POINT

02:03:19.191 --> 02:03:20.025
IS THERE THERE HAS CERTAINLY

02:03:20.092 --> 02:03:21.694
BEEN SOME STATE INVESTMENT SO

02:03:21.761 --> 02:03:23.763
THEN A FEW YEARS LATER TO GIVE

02:03:23.829 --> 02:03:25.965
AWAY -- ALL

02:03:26.031 --> 02:03:27.733
THE THE SEATS AT LEAST DOESN'T.

02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:29.368
MAKE SENSE BUT REALLY THE THE

02:03:29.435 --> 02:03:30.803
QUESTION I HAVE BECAUSE I KNOW A

02:03:30.870 --> 02:03:32.371
LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE OTHER

02:03:32.438 --> 02:03:35.908
QUESTIONS AS AS FORGIVE DOCTOR

02:03:35.975 --> 02:03:36.342
BOSS YANNI.

02:03:36.408 --> 02:03:39.078
HOW DOES THIS AUDIT --

02:03:39.145 --> 02:03:40.613
INFORMED --

02:03:40.679 --> 02:03:42.982
THE MASTER PLAN AND A LOT OF US

02:03:43.048 --> 02:03:43.482
ARE.

02:03:43.549 --> 02:03:49.088
VERY ANXIOUS TO SEE --

02:03:49.155 --> 02:03:49.955
WHAT'S GOING TO BE IN THERE AND

02:03:50.022 --> 02:03:50.656
HOW WE MOVE FORWARD BUT ARE

02:03:50.723 --> 02:03:54.827
THESE FINDINGS GOING --

02:03:54.894 --> 02:03:56.929
TO HELP MOVE THIS FORWARD.

02:03:56.996 --> 02:03:57.997
CHAU EGGMAN LET ME BE CLEAR

02:03:58.063 --> 02:03:59.431
THERE'S TWO THINGS AFOOT THAT

02:03:59.498 --> 02:04:00.099
AYE AYE TWO THINGS TO

02:04:00.166 --> 02:04:00.800
OBLIGATIONS I HAVE TO PRESENT TO

02:04:00.866 --> 02:04:02.568
THE LEGISLATURE BY THE END OF

02:04:02.635 --> 02:04:04.069
THIS YEAR ONCE ISN'T IS A NEEDS

02:04:04.136 --> 02:04:05.838
ASSESSMENT.

02:04:05.905 --> 02:04:07.239
AND THAT IS.

02:04:07.306 --> 02:04:08.307
WE WERE TASKED BY THE

02:04:08.374 --> 02:04:10.075
LEGISLATURE TO START THINKING

02:04:10.142 --> 02:04:11.544
AHEAD TEN TWENTY AND THIRTY

02:04:11.610 --> 02:04:13.279
YEARS TO SEE HOW IS THE VETERAN

02:04:13.345 --> 02:04:15.281
POPULATION CHANGING WHAT ARE THE

02:04:15.347 --> 02:04:16.682
NUMBERS THAT WILL BE COMING OUT

02:04:16.749 --> 02:04:18.517
US WHERE WILL THEY BE COMING

02:04:18.584 --> 02:04:19.451
FROM.

02:04:19.518 --> 02:04:21.854
WHAT AGES WILL THEY HAVE WHAT

02:04:21.921 --> 02:04:23.355
WHAT --

02:04:23.422 --> 02:04:26.192
MEDICAL BURDENS WILL THEY BEAR

02:04:26.258 --> 02:04:27.259
THE THE VETERANS THAT ARE COMING

02:04:27.326 --> 02:04:28.761
WE ALREADY START TO SEE SOME OF

02:04:28.828 --> 02:04:30.529
THE EVIDENCE COMING THROUGH --

02:04:30.596 --> 02:04:31.697
WE HAVE MEETINGS --

02:04:31.764 --> 02:04:35.201
MONTHLY IT'S NOW GETTING TO BE --

02:04:35.267 --> 02:04:36.535
MASTER PLAN SO IT --

02:04:36.602 --> 02:04:38.270
AND I'LL GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT

02:04:38.337 --> 02:04:40.472
MORE ON THAT IN A SECOND --

02:04:40.539 --> 02:04:42.374
WE ALREADY START TO SEE SOME OF

02:04:42.441 --> 02:04:43.876
THE TRENDS THE THE FOR THE

02:04:43.943 --> 02:04:45.010
VETERANS THAT I'M GONNA BE

02:04:45.077 --> 02:04:46.512
TASKED WITH TAKING CARE OF FOR

02:04:46.579 --> 02:04:48.581
MAKING SURE THAT MY SUCCESSORS.

02:04:48.647 --> 02:04:50.916
WILL BE WELL EQUIPPED ARE NOT

02:04:50.983 --> 02:04:53.385
WORLD WAR TWO VETERANS THESE ARE

02:04:53.452 --> 02:04:55.087
NOT -- THESE

02:04:55.154 --> 02:04:57.289
ARE THE THE THE COMING WITH A

02:04:57.356 --> 02:04:59.892
MUCH MORE HEAVY MEDICAL BURDEN --

02:04:59.959 --> 02:05:01.393
THE COMING WITH SIGNIFICANTLY

02:05:01.460 --> 02:05:03.429
MORE DIAGNOSIS ON THE WORLD WAR

02:05:03.495 --> 02:05:04.897
TWO AND KOREAN VETS --

02:05:04.964 --> 02:05:08.100
CAME AT US WITH AND MANY OF THEM

02:05:08.167 --> 02:05:09.201
HAVE.

02:05:09.268 --> 02:05:11.337
ARE GOING TO MAKE DEMANDS ON US

02:05:11.403 --> 02:05:11.871
THAT ARE GOING TO BE VERY

02:05:11.937 --> 02:05:15.908
DIFFICULT. TO TO MEET TO THESE

02:05:15.975 --> 02:05:18.611
ARE MENTAL HEALTH DEMANDS --

02:05:18.677 --> 02:05:21.213
RELATED.

02:05:21.280 --> 02:05:23.148
TO THE EFFECTS THAT THEY SUFFER

02:05:23.215 --> 02:05:24.817
AS A RESULT OF THE MODERN BATTLE

02:05:24.884 --> 02:05:26.218
BATTLEFIELD WHICH WE ARE

02:05:26.285 --> 02:05:29.588
BECOMING INCREASINGLY AWARE IS

02:05:29.655 --> 02:05:30.155
LETHAL TO THE YEMEN BRAIN.

02:05:30.222 --> 02:05:32.191
AND SO MANY OF THE INJURIES ARE

02:05:32.258 --> 02:05:34.426
NOT SOMATIC BUT MENTAL AND

02:05:34.493 --> 02:05:35.961
PSYCHOLOGICAL.

02:05:36.028 --> 02:05:38.030
SO -- HAVING

02:05:38.097 --> 02:05:40.666
SAID THAT THAT THE SO THAT'S

02:05:40.733 --> 02:05:42.401
THAT NEEDS ASSESSMENT I WILL

02:05:42.468 --> 02:05:43.702
PRESENT TO YOU.

02:05:43.769 --> 02:05:46.038
THE MASTER PLAN IS IN A SENSE A

02:05:46.105 --> 02:05:48.173
RESPONSE TO THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT

02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:50.643
IT'S GOING TO BE LET'S LOOK AT

02:05:50.709 --> 02:05:51.810
OUR EIGHT HOMES.

02:05:51.877 --> 02:05:53.279
AND I'M ALREADY STARTING TO SEE

02:05:53.345 --> 02:05:54.613
THE EVIDENCE RIGHT NOW IN THIS

02:05:54.680 --> 02:05:56.081
LAST WEEK WE'RE JUST STARTING TO

02:05:56.148 --> 02:05:57.516
LOOK AT NEEDS ASSESSMENTS THAT

02:05:57.583 --> 02:05:59.518
WERE DONE BY FIVE SISTER STATES.

02:05:59.585 --> 02:06:01.053
I JUST CAME BACK FROM A NATIONAL

02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:01.987
MEETING WHERE WE HAD THESE

02:06:02.054 --> 02:06:04.123
CONVERSATIONS I'M CURIOUS TO SEE

02:06:04.189 --> 02:06:07.459
WHAT THEY ARE LEARNING --

02:06:07.526 --> 02:06:09.695
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT DO WE

02:06:09.762 --> 02:06:10.863
HAVE THE RIGHT NUMBER OF

02:06:10.930 --> 02:06:12.932
FACILITIES ARE THEY IN THE RIGHT

02:06:12.998 --> 02:06:15.567
PLACES I'M ALREADY STARTING TO

02:06:15.634 --> 02:06:17.469
DEVELOP CRITERIA AND LET ME

02:06:17.536 --> 02:06:18.437
SHARE THEM WITH YOU.

02:06:18.504 --> 02:06:20.940
I THINK ANY VETERANS HOME THAT

02:06:21.006 --> 02:06:23.108
WE RUN.

02:06:23.175 --> 02:06:24.944
SHOULD MEET THE FOLLOWING FOUR

02:06:25.010 --> 02:06:28.147
OR FIVE CRITERIA.

02:06:28.213 --> 02:06:29.848
IT SHOULD BE ACROSS THE STREET

02:06:29.915 --> 02:06:33.485
FROM A VA HOSPITAL.

02:06:33.552 --> 02:06:35.587
I HAVE VETERANS IN YON PHIL AND

02:06:35.654 --> 02:06:38.424
AND AND IN REDDING WHERE I HAVE

02:06:38.490 --> 02:06:39.792
TO PUT IN A BUS AND THEY HAVE TO

02:06:39.858 --> 02:06:42.661
DRIVE THREE HOURS ONE WAY TO

02:06:42.728 --> 02:06:45.030
EITHER PAOLO ALTO MARTINEZ MAY

02:06:45.097 --> 02:06:46.832
THIRD -- OR

02:06:46.899 --> 02:06:48.901
FOR MILEY IN SAN FRANCISCO THEIR

02:06:48.968 --> 02:06:49.935
NEAREST VA.

02:06:50.002 --> 02:06:52.037
OF YOU KNOW OF A SET OF FIVE SIX

02:06:52.104 --> 02:06:56.241
HOUR ROUND NOW A VETERANS HOME.

02:06:56.308 --> 02:06:57.576
OUR VETERANS HOMES WERE PLACED

02:06:57.643 --> 02:06:59.578
IN GREAT POSITIONS COM I THINK

02:06:59.645 --> 02:07:00.913
WHEN THEY WERE BUILT.

02:07:00.980 --> 02:07:02.214
WE'RE GONNA LOOK AHEAD AND SEE

02:07:02.281 --> 02:07:04.049
DOES IT MAKE SENSE THAT THEY ALL

02:07:04.116 --> 02:07:05.551
BE WHERE THEY ARE.

02:07:05.617 --> 02:07:06.819
THE I THINK THEY SHOULD BE CLOSE

02:07:06.885 --> 02:07:08.354
TO A VA HOSPITAL I THINK THEY

02:07:08.420 --> 02:07:10.022
SHOULD BE IN A VETERAN RICH --

02:07:10.089 --> 02:07:12.291
DENSITY AREA I THINK THAT THEY

02:07:12.358 --> 02:07:14.593
SHOULD HAVE GREAT INFRASTRUCTURE

02:07:14.660 --> 02:07:16.428
WHERE WE CAN --

02:07:16.495 --> 02:07:17.796
TREAT THEM --

02:07:17.863 --> 02:07:19.565
MORE EASILY IN THE COMMUNITY AND

02:07:19.631 --> 02:07:21.767
THE DOCTORS NURSES AND ENTRY

02:07:21.834 --> 02:07:25.304
LEVEL PHARMACISTS AND CLINICIANS

02:07:25.371 --> 02:07:26.605
AND THERAPISTS SHOULD ALL BE

02:07:26.672 --> 02:07:28.841
ABLE TO LIVE WITHIN A REASONABLE

02:07:28.907 --> 02:07:29.575
DISTANCE.

02:07:29.641 --> 02:07:32.144
OF THE HOMES WHERE THEY WORK

02:07:32.211 --> 02:07:33.712
IT'S NOT EXACTLY THE CASE IN

02:07:33.779 --> 02:07:35.881
WEST LA WHERE MOST OF MY RESUME --

02:07:35.948 --> 02:07:38.050
MOST MY EMPLOYEES HAVE TO TRAVEL

02:07:38.117 --> 02:07:39.885
GREAT GREAT DISTANCES --

02:07:39.952 --> 02:07:41.587
SAME THING WITH NAPA IT'S A VERY

02:07:41.653 --> 02:07:44.390
DIFFICULT REGION FOR ENTRY LEVEL

02:07:44.456 --> 02:07:47.593
EMPLOYEES. TO LIVE ON THE SALARY

02:07:47.659 --> 02:07:48.660
THAT WE GIVE THEM.

02:07:48.727 --> 02:07:50.162
SO WE'RE STARTING TO LOOK I

02:07:50.229 --> 02:07:50.829
THINK -- THE

02:07:50.896 --> 02:07:52.498
MODEL FOR TEN TWENTY AND THIRTY

02:07:52.564 --> 02:07:53.866
YEARS FROM NOW MAY BE A LITTLE

02:07:53.932 --> 02:07:58.737
DIFFERENT THAN THESE LARGE HOMES.

02:07:58.804 --> 02:07:59.371
BUT I WANT TO GIVE TOO MUCH AWAY

02:07:59.438 --> 02:08:00.706
AND I'M.

02:08:00.773 --> 02:08:02.474
UNTIL I START PUTTING THIS STUFF

02:08:02.541 --> 02:08:03.842
TOGETHER WERE STILL IN THE

02:08:03.909 --> 02:08:05.477
RESEARCH PHASE OF THIS OF THE

02:08:05.544 --> 02:08:07.713
WRITING FACE.

02:08:07.780 --> 02:08:09.715
THANK YOU I THINK THOSE ARE --

02:08:09.782 --> 02:08:12.051
SOMETHING THAT MAKES SENSE.

02:08:12.117 --> 02:08:13.786
DOES MOVE TO SENATOR --

02:08:13.852 --> 02:08:15.187

EIGHT OF THEM ARE THEMSELVES

02:12:20.699 --> 02:12:21.700
GOVERNMENT.

02:12:21.767 --> 02:12:24.036
GOVERNOR'S APPOINTEES AND THEY

02:12:24.102 --> 02:12:25.037
WERE INSTRUCTED THAT UNDER NO

02:12:25.103 --> 02:12:26.638
CIRCUMSTANCES COULD THEY

02:12:26.705 --> 02:12:30.575
ENTERTAIN THE LEASES OR LICENSES

02:12:30.642 --> 02:12:33.211
THEY COULD NOT LET THEM OUT --

02:12:33.278 --> 02:12:36.581
WITHOUT BEING CLEARED BY MYSELF

02:12:36.648 --> 02:12:38.850
OR MY DIRECT --

02:12:38.917 --> 02:12:40.319
REPRESENTATIVE --

02:12:40.385 --> 02:12:42.554
AND I THINK THAT THAT MESSAGE

02:12:42.621 --> 02:12:44.356
HAS GOTTEN CARE SO GOING BACK TO

02:12:44.423 --> 02:12:45.424
THESE PLACES SHOULD THEY BE CO

02:12:45.490 --> 02:12:46.491
SIGNED.

02:12:46.558 --> 02:12:49.261
BY -- TGS

02:12:49.328 --> 02:12:50.429

02:12:55.033 --> 02:12:57.235
SHOULD BE ABLE TO REVIEW OF BOTH

02:12:57.302 --> 02:12:58.837
TOGETHER AND COME TO AN

02:12:58.904 --> 02:12:59.137
AGREEMENT.

02:12:59.204 --> 02:13:00.806
BEFORE THEY GO OUT.

02:13:00.872 --> 02:13:02.941
SO YEAH SO --

02:13:03.008 --> 02:13:04.943
THE WAY THE PROCESS WORKS IS YES

02:13:05.010 --> 02:13:07.045
IF I LEASES BEING LET UNDER

02:13:07.112 --> 02:13:08.213
DIGEST WITH ALREADY WE

02:13:08.280 --> 02:13:08.847
TECHNICALLY THE ONES THAT HAVE

02:13:08.914 --> 02:13:10.148
THE SUCH WITH OR TO LET THE

02:13:10.215 --> 02:13:10.682
LEAST IN THE FIRST PLACE.

02:13:10.749 --> 02:13:16.555
THEY WITH A CLIENT IN THIS CASE

02:13:16.621 --> 02:13:19.291
WE WORK TOGETHER IT WOULD BE THE

02:13:19.358 --> 02:13:21.193
THE HOME GET SOMETHING OUTSIDE

02:13:21.259 --> 02:13:22.294
OF THAT NORMAL PROCESS IN WHICH

02:13:22.361 --> 02:13:23.895
CASE AND YES ABSOLUTELY IT

02:13:23.962 --> 02:13:24.463
SHOULD HAVE GONE THROUGH THE

02:13:24.529 --> 02:13:25.230
NORMAL.

02:13:25.297 --> 02:13:26.898
PROCESS I JUST DESCRIBED AND I

02:13:26.965 --> 02:13:28.066
THINK THE MORE TALK ABOUT

02:13:28.133 --> 02:13:29.534
OVERSIGHT LITTLE MUTUAL

02:13:29.601 --> 02:13:31.870
OVERSIGHT BETWEEN BOTH ENTITIES --

02:13:31.937 --> 02:13:33.839
WORKING TOGETHER IS WHAT WE'RE

02:13:33.905 --> 02:13:35.374
HOPING TO SEE THAT ONE SHOULD

02:13:35.440 --> 02:13:37.109
QUESTION ONE ONE SHOULD QUESTION

02:13:37.175 --> 02:13:39.077
THE OTHER IN A COURSE THE BUCK

02:13:39.144 --> 02:13:40.645
STOPS WITH SECRETARY VETERANS

02:13:40.712 --> 02:13:42.314

02:13:42.381 --> 02:13:43.348
WITH THAT.

02:13:43.415 --> 02:13:45.016
EVERY LEE SHOULD BE LOOKED AT

02:13:45.083 --> 02:13:49.121
REVIEWED ACKNOWLEDGED AND AS A

02:13:49.187 --> 02:13:50.222
STATE PASSED THE MUSTARD JOE.

02:13:50.288 --> 02:13:51.823
I HOPE THAT WE'RE GOING IN THAT

02:13:51.890 --> 02:13:53.125
DIRECTION IN THE FUTURE AND I

02:13:53.191 --> 02:13:54.793

ESPECIALLY THE SERVER REPRESENT

02:13:57.929 --> 02:13:59.698
OUR VETERANS AND THEIR CARE WELL

02:13:59.765 --> 02:14:00.599
ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE BEEN

02:14:00.665 --> 02:14:01.400
ABLE -- TO

02:14:01.466 --> 02:14:02.701
CREATE AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN

02:14:02.768 --> 02:14:05.070
POSSIBLE WITHOUT ELAINE HOWLS --

02:14:05.137 --> 02:14:07.272
OFFICE AND AND ALL WE HAD NO

02:14:07.339 --> 02:14:09.875

02:14:15.614 --> 02:14:16.181
HAVE AND WE COULD HAVE BROUGHT

02:14:16.248 --> 02:14:17.883
THIS WELL ACTUALLY I THINK THERE

02:14:17.949 --> 02:14:19.284
IT IS THAT BINDER.

02:14:19.351 --> 02:14:22.854
THAT HAS EVERY SINGLE LEASE AT

02:14:22.921 --> 02:14:24.122
THAT --

02:14:24.189 --> 02:14:28.326
ARRANGEMENT MINOR AND I DIDN'T.

02:14:28.393 --> 02:14:31.696
GOOD THANK YOU THANK YOU WE'RE

02:14:31.763 --> 02:14:33.465

TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA FIRST

02:14:34.366 --> 02:14:35.400
WELL I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

02:14:35.467 --> 02:14:37.135
WE MOVE FORWARD AND I REALLY

02:14:37.202 --> 02:14:38.770
SUPPORT OF THE WAR YOU KNOW

02:14:38.837 --> 02:14:40.372
WHERE WE'RE GOING MOVING FORWARD.

02:14:40.439 --> 02:14:43.241
BUT I GOTTA TELL YA THAT I'M

02:14:43.308 --> 02:14:43.842
GETTING A LITTLE TIRED OF THE

02:14:43.909 --> 02:14:44.743
NARRATIVE --

02:14:44.810 --> 02:14:45.877
THAT SOMEHOW EVEN AS A STATE

02:14:45.944 --> 02:14:47.512
REPRESENTATIVE THAT SOMEHOW A

02:14:47.579 --> 02:14:49.748
SMALL NONPROFIT IN YOUR BILL

02:14:49.815 --> 02:14:52.417
CALIFORNIA SCHOOLED.

02:14:52.484 --> 02:14:54.386
THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS

02:14:54.453 --> 02:14:57.556
AFFAIRS OR SCHOOLED DG HESS.

02:14:57.622 --> 02:14:59.291
I MEAN THE REALITY IS --

02:14:59.357 --> 02:15:01.259
THEY GO THROUGH A PROCESS

02:15:01.326 --> 02:15:02.461
THEY'VE GOT A BANKRUPTCY I DON'T

02:15:02.527 --> 02:15:04.095
I WASN'T INTIMATELY FAMILIAR

02:15:04.162 --> 02:15:05.230
WITH THAT.

02:15:05.297 --> 02:15:06.932
THOSE ARE ALL CIRCUMSTANCES BUT

02:15:06.998 --> 02:15:09.301
IT GETS BACKED NOT TO BLAME

02:15:09.367 --> 02:15:10.502
BEING -- THE

02:15:10.569 --> 02:15:13.104
NONPROFIT FOR THESE TICKETS BUT

02:15:13.171 --> 02:15:14.773
PERHAPS THAT WAS THE BEST THING

02:15:14.840 --> 02:15:16.675
THE TGS OR THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:15:16.741 --> 02:15:18.610
VETERANS AFFAIRS COULD NEGOTIATE

02:15:18.677 --> 02:15:20.445
AT THAT GIVEN TIME.

02:15:20.512 --> 02:15:21.146
BUT MAYBE THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN

02:15:21.213 --> 02:15:23.014
AN HOUR OR SOMETHING IN THREE

02:15:23.081 --> 02:15:24.749
YEARS IF YOU'RE A FINANCIAL

02:15:24.816 --> 02:15:27.219
HEALTH IMPROVES --

02:15:27.285 --> 02:15:28.620
THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO

02:15:28.687 --> 02:15:30.622
GIVING THE VETERANS --

02:15:30.689 --> 02:15:32.524
WHAT THEY NEED IN AS YOU POINTED

02:15:32.591 --> 02:15:34.960
OUT SENATOR THEY RICHLY DESERVE

02:15:35.026 --> 02:15:36.528
AND I THINK THAT THERE PROBABLY

02:15:36.595 --> 02:15:37.996
AT THAT STAGE RIGHT NOW?

02:15:38.063 --> 02:15:39.464
IN IT I GUESS WHAT I JUST WANT

02:15:39.531 --> 02:15:42.200
TO SEE IS THAT WE NOT --

02:15:42.267 --> 02:15:44.703
TAKE THIS FROM THE SUBLIME TO

02:15:44.769 --> 02:15:45.971
THE RIDICULOUS I I APPRECIATE

02:15:46.037 --> 02:15:50.775
THOSE REMARKS CENTER THANK YOU --

02:15:50.842 --> 02:15:51.409
BUT I THINK THAT THAT BOLSTERS

02:15:51.476 --> 02:15:54.179
WHY ARE --

02:15:54.246 --> 02:15:56.748
THE THEY ARE IMPEDIMENTS TO

02:15:56.815 --> 02:16:00.118
ROUTINE RENEGOTIATION OF THINGS

02:16:00.185 --> 02:16:00.318
THAT.

02:16:00.385 --> 02:16:01.987
THINGS CHANGE I TOTALLY DISAGREE

02:16:02.053 --> 02:16:03.622
WITH YOU I TOTALLY DISAGREE WITH

02:16:03.688 --> 02:16:06.057
YOU ON THAT LONG TERM LEASES ARE

02:16:06.124 --> 02:16:07.526
APPROPRIATE WHEN YOU'RE PUTTING

02:16:07.592 --> 02:16:09.728
INVESTMENT IN THE HOME.

02:16:09.794 --> 02:16:11.029
WHEN YOU'RE PUTTING THAT THERE

02:16:11.096 --> 02:16:12.998
IT'S AN AGREED UPON BEFORE YOU

02:16:13.064 --> 02:16:15.200
DO ANYTHING TGS IS INVOLVED WITH

02:16:15.267 --> 02:16:16.968
THAT THEY OBVIOUSLY WERE THE CAL

02:16:17.035 --> 02:16:17.903
THAT WAS AND --

02:16:17.969 --> 02:16:19.604
INVOLVED WITH THAT IN A LONG

02:16:19.671 --> 02:16:21.606
TERM LEASE WAS THE ONLY WAY THAT

02:16:21.673 --> 02:16:23.174
THAT WAS EVER GOING TO HAPPEN

02:16:23.241 --> 02:16:24.309
AND I'M SORRY.

02:16:24.376 --> 02:16:26.411
TGS DEALS WITH LEASES ALL THE

02:16:26.478 --> 02:16:27.779
TIME -- FOR

02:16:27.846 --> 02:16:29.381
REAL ESTATE THROUGHOUT THE STATE

02:16:29.447 --> 02:16:31.716
ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA --

02:16:31.783 --> 02:16:33.285
THAT I GUARANTEE YOU.

02:16:33.351 --> 02:16:35.520
WILL HE JUST MADE IT CLEAR THAT

02:16:35.587 --> 02:16:37.022
THEY DO HAVE EXEMPTIONS FOR

02:16:37.088 --> 02:16:38.924
LONGER TERM LEASES BUT IF YOU

02:16:38.990 --> 02:16:40.158
TAKE A LOOK AT OTHER TYPES OF

02:16:40.225 --> 02:16:41.660
LEASES IN COMMUNITIES.

02:16:41.726 --> 02:16:42.994
OUTSIDE OF CAL BET THEY

02:16:43.061 --> 02:16:45.797
NEGOTIATE LEASES EVERY SINGLE

02:16:45.864 --> 02:16:48.633
DAY SO YOU CAN DO LONG TERM

02:16:48.700 --> 02:16:50.235
LEASES TO PUT IT OFF ON THE FACT

02:16:50.302 --> 02:16:52.270
THAT THAT'S THE ISSUE --

02:16:52.337 --> 02:16:54.472
REALLY NEGLECTS THE FACT THAT IN

02:16:54.539 --> 02:17:00.111
PREVIOUS WHAT NOT NOT YOU GUYS

02:17:00.178 --> 02:17:01.479
WITH THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION.

02:17:01.546 --> 02:17:03.248
CALVET INDEED YES DROPPED THE

02:17:03.315 --> 02:17:04.482
BALL SO HOW THEN PLEASE EXPLAIN

02:17:04.549 --> 02:17:05.650
TO ME HOW THEN DO I THEN GO BACK

02:17:05.717 --> 02:17:06.251
TO THE THEATER MANAGEMENT AND

02:17:06.318 --> 02:17:07.452
SAY IT'S BEEN SEVEN YEARS NOW

02:17:07.519 --> 02:17:09.354
FURTHER ON HOW DO I LOOK THAT'S

02:17:09.421 --> 02:17:10.255
TAKEN HOW DO WE TAKE ANOTHER

02:17:10.322 --> 02:17:11.623
LOOK AT THIS NOW.

02:17:11.690 --> 02:17:13.224
I HAVE NO.

02:17:13.291 --> 02:17:17.495
NO RECOURSE BUT THAT'S NOT THEIR

02:17:17.562 --> 02:17:18.363
FAITH.

02:17:18.430 --> 02:17:19.531
IN WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS IS

02:17:19.598 --> 02:17:22.067
PREVIOUS STATE DEPARTMENTS GOT

02:17:22.133 --> 02:17:24.002
SCHOOL BY THIS LITTLE TINY

02:17:24.069 --> 02:17:25.303
NONPROFIT.

02:17:25.370 --> 02:17:26.371
IN YOUR BILL THAT'S ALMOST THAT

02:17:26.438 --> 02:17:28.373
SOUNDS RIDICULOUS TO ME.

02:17:28.440 --> 02:17:30.008
BUT I WILL GUARANTEE YOU THIS

02:17:30.075 --> 02:17:31.009
ASSEMBLY MEMBER --

02:17:31.076 --> 02:17:33.078
CURRY AND I IF YOU WANT THIS

02:17:33.144 --> 02:17:34.512
EVEN INVOLVED.

02:17:34.579 --> 02:17:37.048
WILL GO WITH YOU TO THOSE NOT

02:17:37.115 --> 02:17:38.049
PROFITS.

02:17:38.116 --> 02:17:40.051
IT TALK ABOUT THINGS THE BENEFIT.

02:17:40.118 --> 02:17:41.386
OUR VETERANS AND MAKE SURE THAT

02:17:41.453 --> 02:17:43.888
OUR VETERANS GET THEIR FAIR

02:17:43.955 --> 02:17:45.857
SHARE AND MAKE SURE THAT.

02:17:45.924 --> 02:17:47.025
EVERY LEASE --

02:17:47.092 --> 02:17:48.593
HERE IS THAT IF WE CAN BE

02:17:48.660 --> 02:17:51.429
HELPFUL IN THAT REGARD WE'D LOVE

02:17:51.496 --> 02:17:54.799
TO DO IT BUT SIRIUS YEAH I

02:17:54.866 --> 02:17:55.567
APPRECIATE THOSE COMMERCENTRE

02:17:55.634 --> 02:17:56.167
DAUGHTER ONE OF THE THINGS YOU

02:17:56.234 --> 02:17:57.769
HAD MENTIONED WAS.

02:17:57.836 --> 02:17:59.604
YOU KNOW IF FOR INSTANCE WE'RE

02:17:59.671 --> 02:18:00.205
TALKING ABOUT THE THEATER THE

02:18:00.271 --> 02:18:01.640
THEATER IS IN BETTER FINANCIAL

02:18:01.706 --> 02:18:02.574
HEALTH.

02:18:02.641 --> 02:18:03.975
PERHAPS WE CAN RENEGOTIATE SOME

02:18:04.042 --> 02:18:06.444
THESE PROVISIONS BECAUSE IN

02:18:06.511 --> 02:18:07.412
TWENTY TWELVE THE SETTLEMENT WAS

02:18:07.479 --> 02:18:08.913
THEY REMOVED.

02:18:08.980 --> 02:18:10.248
THE FREE TICKETS FOR THE

02:18:10.315 --> 02:18:12.083
VETERANS RIGHT AND IF THEY'RE IN

02:18:12.150 --> 02:18:13.652
A BETTER FINANCIAL STATE WHY DO

02:18:13.718 --> 02:18:15.754
WE NOT REINSTITUTE THAT SO

02:18:15.820 --> 02:18:17.622
THERE'S ACTUAL BENEFIT TO

02:18:17.689 --> 02:18:20.692
VETERANS I THINK IS WHAT YOU'RE

02:18:20.759 --> 02:18:20.925
SAYING.

02:18:20.992 --> 02:18:21.826
THAT'S CORRECT.

02:18:21.893 --> 02:18:22.627
TOTALLY RIGHT OKAY WHY

02:18:22.694 --> 02:18:24.029
APPRECIATE THAT I THINK --

02:18:24.095 --> 02:18:25.997
FROM CAL THAT'S PERSPECTIVE

02:18:26.064 --> 02:18:27.198
THEY'RE JUST HAVING A LITTLE BIT

02:18:27.265 --> 02:18:28.733
OF FRUSTRATION BECAUSE THEY FEEL

02:18:28.800 --> 02:18:29.367
LIKE THEY'RE LOCKED INTO THESE

02:18:29.434 --> 02:18:30.402
LONG TERM.

02:18:30.468 --> 02:18:33.304
LEASES WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO

02:18:33.371 --> 02:18:34.339
SOME OF THE PROVISIONS

02:18:34.406 --> 02:18:36.241
ESPECIALLY AS WE HELP VETERANS --

02:18:36.307 --> 02:18:37.575
CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD AND SO

02:18:37.642 --> 02:18:39.177
I GUESS THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE

02:18:39.244 --> 02:18:40.578
TRYING TO DO IS HOW DO WE

02:18:40.645 --> 02:18:41.980

UNDERSTAND --

02:20:51.309 --> 02:20:52.110
IF THERE VIOLATIONS OF LAW I

02:20:52.177 --> 02:20:53.678

02:20:53.745 --> 02:20:55.146
BE A STANDARDS OF PRACTICE AND

OTHER THINGS BUT YOU KNOW JUST A

02:20:56.447 --> 02:20:57.816
BRIGHT LINE OF VIOLIN LANA

02:20:57.882 --> 02:20:58.883
SHOULD THE CONSEQUENCE OF THIS

02:20:58.950 --> 02:21:00.752
IS CIVIL OR CRIMINAL --

02:21:00.819 --> 02:21:02.587

02:21:13.164 --> 02:21:14.299
CALIBER AT LEAST IN TERMS OF

02:21:14.365 --> 02:21:15.300
STEALING FROM VETERANS AND AND

02:21:15.366 --> 02:21:16.568
MISAPPROPRIATING FUNDS IN

EXECUTING LEGAL CONTRACTS AND IT.

02:21:17.602 --> 02:21:18.436
SEEMS LIKE A LOT GOING ON HERE

02:21:18.503 --> 02:21:19.671
THAT MAY GO BEYOND --

02:21:19.737 --> 02:21:21.239
JUST PERSONAL DISMISSAL AND I

MY FOR THE SECRETARY.

02:21:27.912 --> 02:21:29.147
IS THAT I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE

02:21:29.214 --> 02:21:29.848
FOCUS OF THE AUDIT WAS JOHN BILL

02:21:29.914 --> 02:21:31.382
GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE LEASES

02:21:31.449 --> 02:21:32.884
THAT ARE AVAILABLE THERE

02:21:32.951 --> 02:21:33.451
CONTRAST IN WITH SOME OF THE

02:21:33.518 --> 02:21:34.419
OTHER HOMES.

02:21:34.485 --> 02:21:35.320
HOW MUCH OF THIS IS THE

02:21:35.386 --> 02:21:36.955
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE INVOLVED HOW

02:21:37.021 --> 02:21:38.389
MUCH OF THIS IS ABOUT A CULTURE

02:21:38.456 --> 02:21:40.024
I MET CITY VA AND WHAT CAN YOU

02:21:40.091 --> 02:21:41.593

CHANGE THE CULTURE CITY VIA?

02:21:45.763 --> 02:21:47.665
A CULTURE WHERE WE'RE BY THE

02:21:47.732 --> 02:21:49.300
LEASES ORIGINATED AND SOCIAL

02:21:49.367 --> 02:21:50.768
CULTURE WELL I MEAN IN TERMS OF

02:21:50.835 --> 02:21:52.437
THE ABILITY FOR SINGLE

02:21:52.503 --> 02:21:53.872
ADMINISTRATOR TO HAVE.

02:21:53.938 --> 02:21:56.674
THIS KIND OF OF I WOULD SAY

02:21:56.741 --> 02:21:58.610
RECKLESS BEHAVIOR AND WELL AT

02:21:58.676 --> 02:22:00.211
OKAY DO YOU THINK IT'S JUST THE

02:22:00.278 --> 02:22:01.880
ADMINISTRATOR AT A NOW THAT THAT

02:22:01.946 --> 02:22:03.248
PERSON IS NO LONGER THERE.

02:22:03.314 --> 02:22:04.482
WE GENERALLY COOL OR DO YOU DO

02:22:04.549 --> 02:22:06.050
YOU ARE ALL MINISTERS OPERATING

02:22:06.117 --> 02:22:06.651
ON THIS SORT OF LEVEL THAT YOU

02:22:06.718 --> 02:22:07.752
KNOW NOT AND IT IS CERTAINLY NOT

02:22:07.819 --> 02:22:08.586
ANYMORE EVERYONE OF THE

02:22:08.653 --> 02:22:09.821
ADMINISTRATORS KNOWS THAT THEY

02:22:09.888 --> 02:22:10.955
CANNOT DO ANYTHING IN THAT

02:22:11.022 --> 02:22:12.857
MANUAL WITHOUT IT BEING CLEARED

02:22:12.924 --> 02:22:13.591
BY US.

02:22:13.658 --> 02:22:15.793
BUT CAN I JUST WIND THE CLOCK

02:22:15.860 --> 02:22:20.632
BACK TO TWO THOUSAND THE YEAR

02:22:20.698 --> 02:22:21.199
TWO THOUSAND WHICH IS IN OUR

02:22:21.266 --> 02:22:22.333
MEMORY.

02:22:22.400 --> 02:22:24.302
THE IT WAS JUST YEAH BILL YON

02:22:24.369 --> 02:22:26.037
PHIL WAS CAL VET.

02:22:26.104 --> 02:22:27.705
IT WAS HEADQUARTERED THERE ANY

02:22:27.772 --> 02:22:30.241
GREW UP OVER CENTURY AND AS A%

02:22:30.308 --> 02:22:31.576
CONSEQUENCE HISTORICALLY IT

02:22:31.643 --> 02:22:34.112
DEVELOPED A SENSE OF AUTONOMY

02:22:34.178 --> 02:22:36.014
AND THE THE ADMINISTRATORS THAT

02:22:36.080 --> 02:22:38.683
WERE PUT IN THERE FELT NO NEED.

02:22:38.750 --> 02:22:40.351
IT BACKED UP BY HISTORY TO

02:22:40.418 --> 02:22:42.487
COMMUNICATE THEIR ACTIVITIES

02:22:42.553 --> 02:22:43.721
WHETHER IT WAS TO BUILD UP

02:22:43.788 --> 02:22:47.325
THINGS ON THE CAMPUS AND OR TO

02:22:47.392 --> 02:22:48.459
ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS WITH THE

02:22:48.526 --> 02:22:50.595
COMMUNITY FOR THE PLACEMENTS OF

02:22:50.662 --> 02:22:52.497
OF THESE AMENITIES LIKE A GOLF

02:22:52.563 --> 02:22:53.598
COURSE --

02:22:53.665 --> 02:22:54.766
AND THEY DID IT.

02:22:54.832 --> 02:23:01.372
AND WITH SUPPORT OF ALL KINDS OF

02:23:01.439 --> 02:23:03.074
OUTSIDE INFLUENCES [inaudible]

02:23:03.141 --> 02:23:06.678
AND AND SO.

02:23:06.744 --> 02:23:08.813
AS THE TIME HAS GONE BY WE'VE

02:23:08.880 --> 02:23:10.748
SORT OF CORRALLED OUR AUTHORITY

02:23:10.815 --> 02:23:12.984
A LITTLE BIT MORE STRICTLY --

02:23:13.051 --> 02:23:14.986
INSULT THAT LAST DECEMBER WE NOW

02:23:15.053 --> 02:23:17.388
HAVE AN A DIRECTIVE FROM ME THAT

02:23:17.455 --> 02:23:18.890
THEY CAN'T DO THIS BUT YOU CAN

02:23:18.957 --> 02:23:20.358
SEE THAT THIS IS JUST BEEN AN

02:23:20.425 --> 02:23:22.026
ACCRETION OVER HISTORY WHERE.

02:23:22.093 --> 02:23:23.628
HOME ADMINISTRATORS AT YON PHIL

02:23:23.695 --> 02:23:25.163
HAD A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

02:23:25.229 --> 02:23:27.999
AUTONOMY AND EXERCISED.

02:23:28.066 --> 02:23:30.969
SO THE ANSWER I'M SORRY DID YOU

02:23:31.035 --> 02:23:33.137
HAVE FOR NOW.

02:23:33.204 --> 02:23:34.739
I WAS JUST GOING TO ADD --

02:23:34.806 --> 02:23:36.874
THAT'S THERE'S I KNOW AND I KNOW

02:23:36.941 --> 02:23:38.943
THE SIMILAR QUESTIONS ASKED

02:23:39.010 --> 02:23:40.445
EARLIER ABOUT YOU KNOW --

02:23:40.511 --> 02:23:41.646
AT LEAST SOME OF THE WANNA BE

02:23:41.713 --> 02:23:42.680
WRONG BUT ABOUT --

02:23:42.747 --> 02:23:43.815
THE THE EMPHASIS ON THE ON THE

02:23:43.881 --> 02:23:45.850
CAMPUS PART OF THE ISSUE IS JUST

02:23:45.917 --> 02:23:47.318
SIMPLY THAT THE SIZE YEAH I GET

02:23:47.385 --> 02:23:48.686
THAT ME CONNECTION OF YOUR BILL

02:23:48.753 --> 02:23:49.287
OTHER HOMES DON'T NECESSARILY

02:23:49.354 --> 02:23:50.221
HAVE.

02:23:50.288 --> 02:23:52.123
EXCESS SPACE FOR EXAMPLE TO HAVE

02:23:52.190 --> 02:23:52.924
TIME TO REDUCE ITS WHERE I'M

02:23:52.991 --> 02:23:53.858
GOING IN AND I THINK THE

02:23:53.925 --> 02:23:55.026
SECRETARY JUST ANSWERED THAT

02:23:55.093 --> 02:24:00.898
THERE IS A CULTURE AT LEAST

02:24:00.965 --> 02:24:01.499
BECAUSE OF THE HISTORIC NATURE

02:24:01.566 --> 02:24:01.766
OF YOUNG.

02:24:01.833 --> 02:24:02.967
CENTERS BUT THE REASON I ASK IS

02:24:03.034 --> 02:24:04.102
THAT I RECOGNIZE YOUR BILL IS AS

02:24:04.168 --> 02:24:05.003
IS ADVANTAGED IN REAL ESTATE

02:24:05.069 --> 02:24:06.137
RIGHT BUT YOU EASILY COULD HAVE --

02:24:06.204 --> 02:24:08.072
INTERESTING OF RELATIONSHIPS

02:24:08.139 --> 02:24:09.273
CONTRACTS WITH OTHER THAN THE

02:24:09.340 --> 02:24:10.408
INITIATORS COULD HAVE WITH

02:24:10.475 --> 02:24:12.010
OTHERS IN THE COMMUNITY THEY

02:24:12.076 --> 02:24:12.577
DON'T HAVE ANY DO WITH REAL

02:24:12.643 --> 02:24:13.511
ESTATE --

02:24:13.578 --> 02:24:15.179
BUT WOULD BE EQUALLY AS PROPS

02:24:15.246 --> 02:24:16.681
OFFENSIVE TO THIS BODY --

02:24:16.748 --> 02:24:18.282
IF THEY WERE KNOWN SO THAT HAS

02:24:18.349 --> 02:24:20.418
THE QUESTION ABOUT THE CULTURE

02:24:20.485 --> 02:24:21.386
BUILDING AROUND THIS YOU'RE

02:24:21.452 --> 02:24:22.587
SAYING.

02:24:22.653 --> 02:24:23.955
THE ADMINISTRATOR IS NOW GONE.

02:24:24.022 --> 02:24:25.323
HOPEFULLY NO LONGER ON THE STATE

02:24:25.390 --> 02:24:26.758
PAYROLL DECEMBER'S CONCERT A

02:24:26.824 --> 02:24:28.393
GENERAL LIABILITY FOR THE STATE

02:24:28.459 --> 02:24:30.328
BUT THAT THE CULTURE ITSELF AND

02:24:30.395 --> 02:24:30.962
THE SAFEGUARDS HAVE BEEN BUILT

02:24:31.029 --> 02:24:31.362
AROUND.

02:24:31.429 --> 02:24:32.363
BEHAVIOR OF THIS KIND WE

A SENSE OF FREEDOM ON THE PART

02:24:47.812 --> 02:24:49.947
OF PEOPLE THAT RAN THAT CAMPUS

LEASES WERE EXTENDED FOR SO MANY

02:25:22.780 --> 02:25:23.514
YEARS I THINK WE HAVE TO

02:25:23.581 --> 02:25:25.016
REMEMBER IS THAT IT'S A LOT OF

02:25:25.083 --> 02:25:27.051
PRIVATE INVESTORS THAT WERE FROM

02:25:27.118 --> 02:25:27.351
UP IN THAT.

02:25:27.418 --> 02:25:29.887
IN THE AREA THAT HELP FUND SOME

02:25:29.954 --> 02:25:31.322
OF THESE SO FOR INSTANCE THE

02:25:31.389 --> 02:25:33.191
MUSEUM WAS PAID BY A LOT OF

02:25:33.257 --> 02:25:34.959
LOCALS THEY CONTINUE WANT US TO

02:25:35.026 --> 02:25:36.360
SUPPORT THAT THAT MUSEUM.

02:25:36.427 --> 02:25:37.762

WHERE THE TITLE IS WASTEFULNESS

02:27:42.853 --> 02:27:44.722

02:28:41.846 --> 02:28:43.381
THIRTEEN WE STARTED MAKING SURE

02:28:43.447 --> 02:28:45.249

MAXIMUM TIME AND ALL THE OTHER

02:28:51.289 --> 02:28:52.690

CAN TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS

02:29:05.736 --> 02:29:09.006
IS NOT IN THE THE LEASES AND?

02:29:09.073 --> 02:29:09.974
WE NOT ONLY ENTERED INTO NEW

02:29:10.041 --> 02:29:12.009
RELEASES BUT WE WERE NEGOTIATED

02:29:12.076 --> 02:29:13.744
OLDER LEASES TO MAKE SURE THE

02:29:13.811 --> 02:29:15.713
FORMAT AND THE LANGUAGE

02:29:15.780 --> 02:29:19.317
COMPORTED WITH THE NEW STANDARD.

02:29:19.383 --> 02:29:21.018
BUT WHAT'S THE WORD I'M LOOKING

02:29:21.085 --> 02:29:23.521
FOR FOR THE OTHER ACTIVITIES

02:29:23.587 --> 02:29:25.656
THAT WE DAY USE EAH SO.

02:29:25.723 --> 02:29:27.925
I DID NOT HAVE THE TIME TO GO IN

02:29:27.992 --> 02:29:30.127
A LOOK INTO POKE INTO THE WAY I

02:29:30.194 --> 02:29:31.462
DID WHEN THE TWO OF US.

02:29:31.529 --> 02:29:32.897
AT THE THREE OF US WENT INTO

02:29:32.963 --> 02:29:35.533
EVERY ROOM ON THAT CAMPUS.

02:29:35.599 --> 02:29:38.202
WE THE DAY USES THE THE PICNICS

02:29:38.269 --> 02:29:39.737
AND THE BICYCLE RACES ON THE

02:29:39.804 --> 02:29:41.772
WALKS FOR CHARITY BY THE WAY.

02:29:41.839 --> 02:29:45.242
CHARITIES THAT RAISE A LOT OF

02:29:45.309 --> 02:29:47.945
OFTEN.

02:29:48.012 --> 02:29:49.980
AN EMBARRASSINGLY LITTLE AN

02:29:50.047 --> 02:29:51.549
AMOUNT OF THAT IT DOESN'T COME

02:29:51.615 --> 02:29:53.551
SOME OF THEM RAISE MONEY --

02:29:53.617 --> 02:29:55.486
THIS ONE COMING UP IN APRIL THAT

02:29:55.553 --> 02:29:56.554
RAISES A LOT OF MONEY FOR

02:29:56.620 --> 02:29:59.190
VETERANS IN GENERAL STATEWIDE.

02:29:59.256 --> 02:30:01.525
BUT MY NEW STANDARD GOING FORTH

02:30:01.592 --> 02:30:03.461
IT WILL BE TO BENEFIT THE

02:30:03.527 --> 02:30:04.862
RESIDENTS ON THAT CAMPUS.

02:30:04.929 --> 02:30:06.964
BUT I DIDN'T LOOK AT ALL OF

02:30:07.031 --> 02:30:09.266
THOSE THINGS AND I DIDN'T LOOK

02:30:09.333 --> 02:30:11.469
AT THE PEOPLE WHO WERE USING OUR

02:30:11.535 --> 02:30:13.738
PROPERTY WITH NO ARRANGEMENTS AT

02:30:13.804 --> 02:30:15.272
ALL AND I DIDN'T LOOK AT THE

02:30:15.339 --> 02:30:17.475
SUBLET LEASES --

02:30:17.541 --> 02:30:18.576
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M SUPPOSED TO

02:30:18.642 --> 02:30:19.844
THERE'S A DANCE COMPANY THAT

02:30:19.910 --> 02:30:22.446
USES THE THEATER I DON'T KNOW

02:30:22.513 --> 02:30:24.315
WHAT THAT ARRANGEMENT IS.

02:30:24.382 --> 02:30:25.516
THE LITTLE GIRL FALLS AND BREAKS

02:30:25.583 --> 02:30:27.318
HER ANKLE WHO GET SUED I DON'T

02:30:27.385 --> 02:30:29.954
KNOW BUT I WILL FIND OUT.

02:30:30.020 --> 02:30:31.689
AND I WILL MAKE SURE THAT WERE

02:30:31.756 --> 02:30:33.257
INDEMNIFIED --

02:30:33.324 --> 02:30:35.593
AT THAT ALL PARTIES ARE COVERED

02:30:35.659 --> 02:30:37.294
THAT THE STATE IS PROTECTED.

02:30:37.361 --> 02:30:39.263
SO I THINK GOING FORWARD WE ARE

02:30:39.330 --> 02:30:41.465
QUITE CLEAR THAT OUR PARTNERSHIP

02:30:41.532 --> 02:30:43.734
WILL WHAT DO YOU CALL ME BACK IN

02:30:43.801 --> 02:30:45.836
SIX MONTHS OR SIX YEARS WILL.

02:30:45.903 --> 02:30:48.439
WILL BE ABLE TO SHOW WE'RE NOW

02:30:48.506 --> 02:30:49.840
ON A STRAIGHT AND NARROW PATH.

02:30:49.907 --> 02:30:53.544
BUT THE LONG TERM LEASES I WILL --

02:30:53.611 --> 02:30:55.579
I'M SADDLED WITH THEM UNLESS

02:30:55.646 --> 02:30:57.748
THERE'S SOME OTHER KIND OF

02:30:57.815 --> 02:31:00.151
RELIEF THAT I CAN'T IMAGINE.

02:31:00.217 --> 02:31:00.985

PRIORITIZE THAT THEY CARE ABOUT

02:31:05.423 --> 02:31:07.124
TRENDS AND I THINK IT IS A

02:31:07.191 --> 02:31:08.025
TREMENDOUS ACHIEVEMENT THAT YOU

02:31:08.092 --> 02:31:09.860
YOU KNOW TOOK THEM FROM A TWO

02:31:09.927 --> 02:31:10.661
STAR RATING.

02:31:10.728 --> 02:31:12.663
TO SPEND THE BEST FACILITIES IN

02:31:12.730 --> 02:31:14.999
CALIFORNIA SO I THINK THAT'S

02:31:15.065 --> 02:31:16.867
REALLY SOMETHING TO BE PROUD.

02:31:16.934 --> 02:31:18.102

QUESTIONING [inaudible]

02:31:20.538 --> 02:31:21.906
THANK YOU.

02:31:21.972 --> 02:31:24.308
WHEN I STILL FIND HARD --

02:31:24.375 --> 02:31:26.710
TO UNDERSTAND THANKS SAID AS

02:31:26.777 --> 02:31:30.281
SAID BY SENATOR DODD IS.

02:31:30.347 --> 02:31:32.917
HOW THIS COULD HAPPEN?

02:31:32.983 --> 02:31:36.353
UNDER THE NOSE OF A DEPARTMENT

02:31:36.420 --> 02:31:39.990
LIKE THE G. S. AND CAL THAT'S

02:31:40.057 --> 02:31:42.993
YOU KNOW IT'S THERE'S SOME FOLKS

02:31:43.060 --> 02:31:43.794
ON THE GROUND.

02:31:43.861 --> 02:31:46.597
WHO DID WRONG?

02:31:46.664 --> 02:31:47.665
BUT HOW DID THAT GET.

02:31:47.731 --> 02:31:50.201
PASSED [inaudible]

02:31:50.267 --> 02:31:52.870
THESE DEPARTMENTS.

02:31:52.937 --> 02:31:55.940
UP ON IT AND OVER AND OVER HOW

02:31:56.006 --> 02:31:57.241
TO GET PASSED TO ME IT'S NOT SO

02:31:57.308 --> 02:31:57.942
MUCH.

02:31:58.008 --> 02:31:59.777
WE COULD WE COULD FIGURE OUT

02:31:59.844 --> 02:32:02.513
WHAT WENT WRONG WITH SOME LEASES.

02:32:02.580 --> 02:32:04.882
BUT MY CONCERN IS HOW IT EVEN

02:32:04.949 --> 02:32:06.884
HAPPENED IN THE FIRST PLACE.

02:32:06.951 --> 02:32:08.452
BECAUSE THIS IS NOT SOME.

02:32:08.519 --> 02:32:09.887
ERROR IS SOME DEPARTMENT THAT'S

02:32:09.954 --> 02:32:11.956
WAY OUT THERE THAT NOBODY EVER

02:32:12.022 --> 02:32:13.858
CARES ABOUT.

02:32:13.924 --> 02:32:15.526
CALVET CINDY GS.

02:32:15.593 --> 02:32:17.995
ARE HUGE TO DOUBLE THE GS HUGE

02:32:18.062 --> 02:32:19.430
DEPARTMENTS AND YOU'RE ONLY

02:32:19.497 --> 02:32:21.265
RESPONSIBLE MORE BIG

02:32:21.332 --> 02:32:22.666
RESPONSIBILITIES THESE LEASES.

02:32:22.733 --> 02:32:24.668
HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN THAT THE

02:32:24.735 --> 02:32:28.405
HIGHER UP LOW TAKE PLACE?

02:32:28.472 --> 02:32:30.040
WELL IF I COULD IF I COULD --

02:32:30.107 --> 02:32:31.075
OFFER SOME PROTECTION TO MY

02:32:31.141 --> 02:32:32.710
COLLEAGUES FROM THE G. S. I

02:32:32.776 --> 02:32:34.111
THINK WHEN A A LEASE WAS

02:32:34.178 --> 02:32:35.679
NEGOTIATED --

02:32:35.746 --> 02:32:37.181
INFORMALLY BETWEEN THE HOME

02:32:37.248 --> 02:32:39.450
ADMINISTRATOR AT DOWN FELL BACK

02:32:39.517 --> 02:32:41.352
IN THE EIGHTIES AND THE NINETIES --

02:32:41.418 --> 02:32:43.087
AND ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE WITH

02:32:43.153 --> 02:32:44.922
VARIOUS ENTITIES AND THEN

02:32:44.989 --> 02:32:47.057
BROUGHT TO D. G. S. IT PROBABLY

02:32:47.124 --> 02:32:50.027
LOOKED BONAFIDE IT PROBABLY

02:32:50.094 --> 02:32:57.234
LOOKS GOOD I I AT LEAST.

02:32:57.301 --> 02:33:01.805
I MEAN HOW DOES IT LOOK GOOD.

02:33:01.872 --> 02:33:03.107
SO YEAH --

02:33:03.173 --> 02:33:03.974
IT'S A IT'S A VERY VERY FAIR

02:33:04.041 --> 02:33:05.409
QUESTION IT REALLY IS I WOULD

02:33:05.476 --> 02:33:06.443
SAY -- AND

02:33:06.510 --> 02:33:07.645
THIS KIND OF GOES BACK TO

02:33:07.711 --> 02:33:08.379
SOMETHING THAT CENTER DOT HAD

02:33:08.445 --> 02:33:09.947
TIED KIND OF ALLUDED TO I DON'T

02:33:10.014 --> 02:33:11.749
WANT TO DEMONIZED ANY OF THE IN

02:33:11.815 --> 02:33:13.317
PARTICULAR LESSEES IN THIS

02:33:13.384 --> 02:33:14.618
PROCESS --

02:33:14.685 --> 02:33:16.287
THERE ARE SOME LEASES --

02:33:16.353 --> 02:33:18.055
WHERE EVEN EVEN THOUGH SO MANY

02:33:18.122 --> 02:33:19.356
THINGS RUN FABLE THERE MAY HAVE

02:33:19.423 --> 02:33:21.325
BEEN GOOD EXPLANATIONS OF THE

02:33:21.392 --> 02:33:23.193
TIME FOR THEM?

02:33:23.260 --> 02:33:24.395
UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE THERE ISN'T

02:33:24.461 --> 02:33:25.663
IMITATIONS HARD TO ACTUALLY SAY

02:33:25.729 --> 02:33:26.530
THAT NOW.

02:33:26.597 --> 02:33:28.198
LOOKING BACK IN A TWENTY THIRTY

02:33:28.265 --> 02:33:29.033
YEARS LATER SOME CASES WE GO

02:33:29.099 --> 02:33:30.234
BACK AND WE THINK THAT THIS IS

02:33:30.301 --> 02:33:32.736
THE SAME KIND OF CRAZY --

02:33:32.803 --> 02:33:35.005
IN THOSE INSTANCES YES IT DOES

02:33:35.072 --> 02:33:37.241
LOOK LIKE IT IT ALTERNATELY WAS

02:33:37.308 --> 02:33:39.677
NEGLIGENT ON ON BOTH DEPARTMENTS

02:33:39.743 --> 02:33:41.412
PART IN MAKING SURE THAT THESE

02:33:41.478 --> 02:33:42.012
WERE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF

02:33:42.079 --> 02:33:43.914
TIME AGAIN BIT BY THAT YOU BY

02:33:43.981 --> 02:33:44.315
VIRTUE HINDSIGHT.

02:33:44.381 --> 02:33:45.716
UNLESS THERE WAS SOME MITIGATING

02:33:45.783 --> 02:33:49.753
CIRCUMSTANCES --

02:33:49.820 --> 02:33:51.655
THESE THESE TO GET THROUGH.

02:33:51.722 --> 02:33:52.256
I I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR ASIDE

02:33:52.323 --> 02:33:53.724
FROM AND I REALLY APPRECIATE.

02:33:53.791 --> 02:33:54.358
YOUR LOOKING FORWARD THE MASTER

02:33:54.425 --> 02:33:57.761
PLAN TAKING SOME CORRECTIONS BUT

02:33:57.828 --> 02:33:58.729
I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT

02:33:58.796 --> 02:34:00.197
CORRECTIONS IT CAN BE MADE AT A

02:34:00.264 --> 02:34:01.865
HIGHER LEVEL.

02:34:01.932 --> 02:34:06.770
NOT JUST ON THE GROUND.

02:34:06.837 --> 02:34:08.706
I CAN RESPOND FOR TGS AT LEAST I

02:34:08.772 --> 02:34:09.473
MEAN.

02:34:09.540 --> 02:34:10.174
AS I LIEU TO BEGINNING MY

02:34:10.240 --> 02:34:12.676
TESTIMONY YOU KNOW WE WE HAVE

02:34:12.743 --> 02:34:14.244
TWO DIFFERENT GROUPS AT TGS THAT

02:34:14.311 --> 02:34:16.013
HISTORICALLY DO LEASING ONE THAT

02:34:16.080 --> 02:34:17.548
GOES OUT TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR

02:34:17.615 --> 02:34:18.983
IN LEASES THEIR SPACE AND ONE

02:34:19.049 --> 02:34:20.618
THAT LEASES STATE SPACE.

02:34:20.684 --> 02:34:22.620
THE GROUP AT LEAST STATE SPACE --

02:34:22.686 --> 02:34:24.288
IS QUITE SMALL --

02:34:24.355 --> 02:34:26.056
AND IT'S IT'S ESSENTIALLY BEEN

02:34:26.123 --> 02:34:27.424
SOMETHING OF A CORNER FOR A

02:34:27.491 --> 02:34:28.859
NUMBER OF YEARS --

02:34:28.926 --> 02:34:29.927
IN ORDER AND THE GROUP THAT

02:34:29.994 --> 02:34:30.995
ACTUALLY GOES OUT AND LEASES

02:34:31.061 --> 02:34:32.396
PRIVATE SECTOR SPACE BECAUSE

02:34:32.463 --> 02:34:34.231
IT'S LARGER IT'S MORE ABOUT SB

02:34:34.298 --> 02:34:35.899
TOO FAR FAR MORE TRANSACTIONS

02:34:35.966 --> 02:34:37.568
THERE'S A LOT MORE PROCESS A

02:34:37.635 --> 02:34:38.502
PROCEDURE THAT'S BUILT AROUND

02:34:38.569 --> 02:34:40.237
THE PASSING SO ONE OF THE FIRST

02:34:40.304 --> 02:34:41.905
THINGS THAT WE DID WAS.

02:34:41.972 --> 02:34:42.640
WHEN I?

02:34:42.706 --> 02:34:43.974
CAME ON BOARD AND IN TWENTY

02:34:44.041 --> 02:34:45.275
EIGHTEEN WE WE TOOK THOSE TWO

02:34:45.342 --> 02:34:46.176
GROUPS AND WE MERGE THEM

02:34:46.243 --> 02:34:46.844
TOGETHER --

02:34:46.910 --> 02:34:48.912
SO NOW THERE'S A SINGLE PERSON

02:34:48.979 --> 02:34:49.580
RESPONSIBLE FOR STATE LEASING IN

02:34:49.647 --> 02:34:51.649
GENERAL SECOND THING WAS THOSE

02:34:51.715 --> 02:34:52.583
TWO GROUPS DID HAVE

02:34:52.650 --> 02:34:53.884
DECENTRALIZED THESE MANAGEMENT

02:34:53.951 --> 02:34:54.518
THEY'RE KIND OF RESPONSIBLE FOR

02:34:54.585 --> 02:34:55.853
THEIR OWN --

02:34:55.919 --> 02:34:57.721
DEPOSITING OF FUNDS AND

02:34:57.788 --> 02:34:58.455
VALIDATING THAT --

02:34:58.522 --> 02:34:59.657
RENEWALS ARE HAPPENING ON TIME

02:34:59.723 --> 02:35:01.258
AND SO WE'VE PULLED THOSE

02:35:01.325 --> 02:35:02.926
FUNCTIONS OUT AND CENTRALIZE

02:35:02.993 --> 02:35:03.494
THEM AS WELL SO THERE'S OF

02:35:03.560 --> 02:35:04.628
ESSENTIALLY OF A THIRD PARTY

02:35:04.695 --> 02:35:06.397
ACCOUNTABILITY WITH THAT SECTION

02:35:06.463 --> 02:35:11.902
TO MAKE SURE THAT --

02:35:11.969 --> 02:35:12.403
LEASE PAYMENTS ARE BEING

02:35:12.469 --> 02:35:14.805
COLLECTED TIMELY THE WE'VE DONE

02:35:14.872 --> 02:35:17.141
THOSE REORGANIZATIONS THE SECOND

02:35:17.207 --> 02:35:18.142
PIECE AND THIS IS THIS IS WHAT I

02:35:18.208 --> 02:35:19.777
LAMENTED THE AUDIT IS YOU KNOW

02:35:19.843 --> 02:35:21.011
AS I LOOK BACK AT SOME LEASES

02:35:21.078 --> 02:35:22.312
THAT EXIST ON THE APPLE THE SOME

02:35:22.379 --> 02:35:23.681
OF THE MORE RECENT ONES.

02:35:23.747 --> 02:35:25.215
EVEN THE ONES POST TWENTY

02:35:25.282 --> 02:35:26.917
THIRTEEN I SEE INDICATIONS THAT

02:35:26.984 --> 02:35:28.352
THEY WERE DONE IN IT IN KEEPING

02:35:28.419 --> 02:35:29.853
WITH HOW WE CAN EXPECT TO SEE

02:35:29.920 --> 02:35:31.288
FAIR MARKET VALUE DETERMINED I

02:35:31.355 --> 02:35:32.523
CAN'T PROVE IT UNFORTUNATE

02:35:32.589 --> 02:35:33.991
BECAUSE THE POOR DOCUMENTATION

02:35:34.058 --> 02:35:35.492
AND SO WE DO.

02:35:35.559 --> 02:35:36.894
WE DID --

02:35:36.960 --> 02:35:38.962
MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS NOT ONLY

02:35:39.029 --> 02:35:41.699
A POSSIBLE TEN THAT MIRRORS --

02:35:41.765 --> 02:35:43.133
THE OTHER LEASING GROUPS --

02:35:43.200 --> 02:35:44.802
DOCUMENTATION SENATOR FAR MORE

02:35:44.868 --> 02:35:47.404
BUST BUT WE BEGAN TRAINING STAFF

02:35:47.471 --> 02:35:48.605
TO THAT EFFECT --

02:35:48.672 --> 02:35:51.675
WE HAVE ALSO LOOKED AT EACH OF

02:35:51.742 --> 02:35:53.277
THESE AREAS THE AUDITOR --

02:35:53.343 --> 02:35:54.545
IDENTIFIED SO AGAIN THAT'S FOR

02:35:54.611 --> 02:35:56.380
MARKET VALUE IN LIEU BY PUBLIC

02:35:56.447 --> 02:35:57.648
BENEFIT --

02:35:57.715 --> 02:35:59.750
WE'VE GOT SOME LEASES THAT IN

02:35:59.817 --> 02:36:01.218
SOME CASES WERE SUCH POORLY

02:36:01.285 --> 02:36:02.820
ENACTED THAT ARE IN A FIFTY YEAR

02:36:02.886 --> 02:36:03.454
LATE NIGHT OF VETERAN SUMS BUT

02:36:03.520 --> 02:36:03.687
OTHER.

02:36:03.754 --> 02:36:05.355
OTHER LOCATIONS WITH A LONG TERM

02:36:05.422 --> 02:36:06.356
LEASES AT CERTAIN RATES AND WE

02:36:06.423 --> 02:36:07.524
HAVE TO BRING THEM TO FOR MARKET

02:36:07.591 --> 02:36:08.158
VALUE --

02:36:08.225 --> 02:36:09.560
AFTER THOSE TERMS EXPIRE IN ALL

02:36:09.626 --> 02:36:10.894
THOSE CASES WE'VE GOT POLICIES

02:36:10.961 --> 02:36:13.764
NOW TO ADDRESS SPECIFICALLY HOW

02:36:13.831 --> 02:36:15.332
TO DO THOSE THINGS --

02:36:15.399 --> 02:36:16.266
PROOF WILL BE IN THE PUDDING

02:36:16.333 --> 02:36:18.001
WHETHER WE CAN SHOW THAT WERE

02:36:18.068 --> 02:36:19.303
ACTIVELY MANAGING TO THOSE

02:36:19.369 --> 02:36:19.970
THINGS --

02:36:20.037 --> 02:36:21.004
AND I THINK THE AUDITOR AND

02:36:21.071 --> 02:36:23.207
THEIR RESPONSE TO OUR OUR

02:36:23.273 --> 02:36:25.175
RESPONSES SO FAR HAVE BEEN.

02:36:25.242 --> 02:36:30.581
YES YOU WITH POLICIES IN PLACE

02:36:30.647 --> 02:36:31.181
TO GET APPROVED ACTUALLY DOING

02:36:31.248 --> 02:36:38.622
IT BECAUSE THERE IS A KIND.

02:36:38.689 --> 02:36:42.860
ALL RIGHT THANK.

02:36:42.926 --> 02:36:44.061
SO RAZA WAS TALKING ABOUT THE

02:36:44.128 --> 02:36:45.395
LEASES WELL A LOT OF US WERE

02:36:45.462 --> 02:36:46.497
TALKING ABOUT THE LEASES AND

02:36:46.563 --> 02:36:47.331
SEEMS TO BE LIKE SOME

02:36:47.397 --> 02:36:49.767
DISCREPANCY SO I'LL JUST GET

02:36:49.833 --> 02:36:51.668
SOME CLARITY FROM D. G. S..

02:36:51.735 --> 02:36:52.102
THE SIMS --

02:36:52.169 --> 02:36:53.704
THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME

02:36:53.771 --> 02:36:55.405
DISCREPANCY BETWEEN WHAT THE

02:36:55.472 --> 02:36:56.874
AUTHOR PRESENTED WENT --

02:36:56.940 --> 02:36:59.576
CODE SECTION YOUR FOLLOWING OVER

02:36:59.643 --> 02:37:01.678
AT THE GS AND LET ME JUST ASK

02:37:01.745 --> 02:37:02.613
ONE GENERAL QUESTION.

02:37:02.679 --> 02:37:04.248
SENSORS MULTIPLE CODE SECTIONS

02:37:04.314 --> 02:37:06.583
WHICH ONE DOES THE GS FOLLOWER

02:37:06.650 --> 02:37:08.018
FOLLOWER DOESN'T LIKE WHAT CODE

02:37:08.085 --> 02:37:11.522
SECTION FOR ONE LEASES ANOTHER

02:37:11.588 --> 02:37:13.223
CODE SECTION FOR ANOTHER LEASE.

02:37:13.290 --> 02:37:15.359
SO -- I CAN

02:37:15.425 --> 02:37:16.026
IS THAT WHAT QUESTION ONE OF TWO

02:37:16.093 --> 02:37:16.627
WAYS YOU KNOW BECAUSE DID YES

02:37:16.693 --> 02:37:17.161
BECAUSE WE HAVE A LEASING

02:37:17.227 --> 02:37:18.729
AUTHORITY FOR MOST APARTMENTS --

02:37:18.796 --> 02:37:19.863
WE HAVE SORT OF OUR DEFAULT

02:37:19.930 --> 02:37:21.231
AUTHORITY WHICH IS GOVERNMENT

02:37:21.298 --> 02:37:23.433
CODE -- ONE

02:37:23.500 --> 02:37:24.468
FOUR SIX SEVEN ZERO THAT IS --

02:37:24.535 --> 02:37:25.602
KIND OF IT'S IT'S OUR IT'S OUR

02:37:25.669 --> 02:37:27.671
GO TO NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN

02:37:27.738 --> 02:37:28.272
BECAUSE MOST APARTMENTS DON'T

02:37:28.338 --> 02:37:31.241
HAVE ANY SPECIAL LEASE AUTHORITY --

02:37:31.308 --> 02:37:32.176
WERE SPECIAL PROVISIONS ABOUT

02:37:32.242 --> 02:37:34.978
LEASING --

02:37:35.045 --> 02:37:35.746
HOWEVER --

02:37:35.813 --> 02:37:37.080
IF THERE IS A PIECE OF PROPERTY

02:37:37.147 --> 02:37:38.148
THAT IS --

02:37:38.215 --> 02:37:39.449
ACCESS TO DEPARTMENTS

02:37:39.516 --> 02:37:40.951
FORESEEABLE NEED WE CAN ENTER

02:37:41.018 --> 02:37:42.019

FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

02:37:48.158 --> 02:37:49.593
SO DEPENDING ON THE SPECIFIC

02:37:49.660 --> 02:37:51.195

THIS A CAPITAL INVESTMENT OR

02:38:15.619 --> 02:38:16.720
THERE ARE SOME SOME NEED TO DO

02:38:16.787 --> 02:38:18.055

02:38:28.899 --> 02:38:30.200
LEASES ARE ADDITIONAL

02:38:30.267 --> 02:38:32.970

02:38:38.342 --> 02:38:39.877
MOVING TO THIS YEAR'S AUDITS.

02:38:39.943 --> 02:38:41.578

02:38:41.645 --> 02:38:43.213

SURE I MEAN I THINK --

02:39:02.132 --> 02:39:03.800

OF A LEASE FORM TEMPLATE --

02:39:07.771 --> 02:39:08.305

SOMETHING LONG TERM --

02:39:24.321 --> 02:39:25.088
ESPECIALLY SOMETHING THAT WAS

02:39:25.155 --> 02:39:27.391
NATION A GOOD EXAMPLE IS --

02:39:27.457 --> 02:39:28.959
YOU KNOW THERE WAS A LEGISLATION

02:39:29.026 --> 02:39:30.861

02:39:49.980 --> 02:39:51.348
LEASE TERM WE TAILOR IT TO THAT

02:39:51.415 --> 02:39:52.716

OF AT LEAST THE TEN YEARS OF ITS

02:51:43.226 --> 02:51:45.895
HISTORY.

02:51:45.962 --> 02:51:48.831

APART AFTER CONTRACTS IN THE

02:51:52.168 --> 02:51:53.102
TWENTY THIRTEEN THERE WAS IN

02:51:53.169 --> 02:51:54.804

02:51:55.872 --> 02:51:57.573
INTENDED TO DO THAT.

02:51:57.640 --> 02:51:59.008
AND IT WAS --

02:51:59.075 --> 02:52:02.045

02:52:18.728 --> 02:52:20.596
SO SO THE FIRST EFFORT TO DO

02:52:20.663 --> 02:52:22.231
THAT WAS.

02:52:22.298 --> 02:52:24.867
DIRECTED TO SOMEWHERE ELSE.

02:52:24.934 --> 02:52:26.769
AS TO WHY THE TICKETS WERE TAKEN

02:52:26.836 --> 02:52:28.471

ANYTHING SHORT OF THIS IS ON

03:01:09.458 --> 03:01:10.326

FIRST AND FOREMOST WE WOULD LIKE

03:01:11.093 --> 03:01:11.660

AS YOU CAN UNDERSTAND SUCH

03:01:44.393 --> 03:01:46.061
SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL INVESTMENT

03:01:46.128 --> 03:01:48.297
IN REAL PROPERTY IS NOT POSSIBLE

03:01:48.364 --> 03:01:49.398

03:01:55.371 --> 03:01:57.072
SEE A RETURN ON ITS INVESTMENT.

03:01:57.139 --> 03:01:58.607
WHEN THE AUDITOR'S APPRAISER

03:01:58.674 --> 03:01:59.908

RENT FOR THE THEATER IS ONE

03:02:01.810 --> 03:02:04.179
POINT THREE SIX MILLION PER YEAR?

03:02:04.246 --> 03:02:05.648
THE AUDITOR FAILED TO NOTE THAT

03:02:05.714 --> 03:02:06.849

RENOVATE AND MAINTAIN THE

03:02:11.587 --> 03:02:12.388

LINCOLN THEATRE HAS ALREADY PAID

03:02:16.258 --> 03:02:16.992
TO OCCUPY THE PROPERTY.

03:02:17.059 --> 03:02:18.327
