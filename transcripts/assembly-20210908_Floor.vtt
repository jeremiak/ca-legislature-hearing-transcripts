05:03:49.911 --> 05:03:51.813
SO WIDESPREAD WE WOULDN'T BE

HERE TODAY. AND THIS BILL WOULD

05:03:54.716 --> 05:03:56.051
NOT HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE

REVISION OF THE PENAL CODE.

05:04:03.992 --> 05:04:06.928
LET'S START WITH THEM DATA.

05:04:06.995 --> 05:04:08.129
GANG ENHANCEMENTS ARE USED

05:04:08.196 --> 05:04:09.831
DISPROPORTIONATELY AGAINST

05:04:09.898 --> 05:04:11.733
PEOPLE OF COLOR AND HAVE

05:04:11.800 --> 05:04:14.803
RESULTED IN HARMFUL SYSTEMIC

CRIMINALIZATION OF INDIVIDUALS

05:04:16.838 --> 05:04:18.974
FAMILIES CULTURES AND

05:04:19.040 --> 05:04:22.177
COMMUNITIES. 92% OF PEOPLE WITH

05:04:22.243 --> 05:04:24.379
GANG ENHANCEMENTS IN CALIFORNIA

05:04:24.446 --> 05:04:27.949
ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR. NOTABLY

05:04:28.016 --> 05:04:30.452
THERE IS NO EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE

05:04:30.518 --> 05:04:31.820
THAT GANG ENHANCEMENTS HAVE

05:04:31.886 --> 05:04:33.154
BEEN EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING

05:04:33.221 --> 05:04:36.091
CRIME OR PROTECTING COMMUNITIES.

05:04:36.157 --> 05:04:40.228
BUT THERE IS DATA THAT SHOWS

05:04:40.295 --> 05:04:42.163
THAT LONGER SENTENCES DO NOT

05:04:42.230 --> 05:04:44.933
MAKE US SAFER. OUR GANG

05:04:45.000 --> 05:04:46.768
ENHANCEMENT STATUE HAS VAGUE

05:04:46.835 --> 05:04:49.237
DEFINITIONS WEEK SANDERS

05:04:49.304 --> 05:04:51.106
APPROVED AND ARE PERHAPS THE

05:04:51.172 --> 05:04:52.741
MOST RACIALLY DISCRIMINATORY

05:04:52.807 --> 05:04:54.342
PART OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE

05:04:54.409 --> 05:04:58.413
SYSTEM. AB THREE THREE THREE IS

05:04:58.480 --> 05:05:00.081
MERELY A STEP IN THE RIGHT

05:05:00.148 --> 05:05:03.151
DIRECTION. WE ABSOLUTELY MUST

05:05:03.218 --> 05:05:04.486
GO MUCH FURTHER IF WE WANT TO

05:05:04.552 --> 05:05:06.721
PRESERVE ANY SENSE OF JUSTICE

05:05:06.788 --> 05:05:09.057
AND OUR CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM.

05:05:09.124 --> 05:05:12.227
AT ITS CORE THIS BILL IS REALLY

05:05:12.293 --> 05:05:15.196
ABOUT DUE PROCESS. IT IS TIME

05:05:15.263 --> 05:05:16.898
FOR US TO STOP RELYING ON

05:05:16.965 --> 05:05:18.833
ARCANE AND HARMFUL TOOLS LIKE

05:05:18.900 --> 05:05:23.705
FEAR BIAS. AND STEREO TYPES AND

05:05:23.772 --> 05:05:25.774
DEMAND THAT PROSECUTORS PROVE

05:05:25.840 --> 05:05:27.676
THE CHARGES THAT THEY LEVY

05:05:27.742 --> 05:05:30.779
AGAINST SOMEONE. AB THREE THREE

05:05:30.845 --> 05:05:31.646
THREE MAKE CHANGES TO THE LAW

05:05:31.713 --> 05:05:34.449
THAT WILL REDUCE PROSECUTORIAL

05:05:34.516 --> 05:05:36.084
OVERREACH BY MAKING THE

05:05:36.151 --> 05:05:37.619
STANDARDS FOR APPLYING A GANG

05:05:37.686 --> 05:05:40.221
ENHANCEMENT EVER SO SLIGHTLY

05:05:40.288 --> 05:05:43.358
MORE RIGOROUS. THIS BILL DOES

05:05:43.425 --> 05:05:45.794
NOT MAKE THE APPLICATION OF

05:05:45.860 --> 05:05:48.763
GANG ENHANCEMENT IMPOSSIBLE. I

05:05:48.830 --> 05:05:50.865
WILL RESTATE THAT THIS BILL

05:05:50.932 --> 05:05:53.468
DOES NOT MAKE THE APPLICATION

05:05:53.535 --> 05:05:55.804
OF GANG ENHANCEMENT IMPOSSIBLE.

05:05:55.870 --> 05:05:57.138
RATHER IT REQUIRES THAT

05:05:57.205 --> 05:05:59.941
SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE BE PROVIDED

05:06:00.008 --> 05:06:01.176
IN ORDER TO PROVE THAT THE

05:06:01.242 --> 05:06:03.178
UNDERLYING OFFENSE WAS ACTUALLY

05:06:03.244 --> 05:06:06.581
COMMITTED ON BEHALF OF THE GANG.

05:06:06.648 --> 05:06:07.949
THE SENSIBLE CHANGES WILL

05:06:08.016 --> 05:06:09.751
ENSURE THAT GANG ENHANCEMENTS

05:06:09.818 --> 05:06:12.487
ARE APPLIED TO ONLY THEMOST

05:06:12.554 --> 05:06:15.023
SERIOUS AND VIOLENT OFFENSES.

05:06:15.090 --> 05:06:16.224
THROUGHOUT THE LEGISLATIVE

05:06:16.291 --> 05:06:18.059
PROCESS THE AUTHOR HAS TAKEN

05:06:18.126 --> 05:06:19.461
SEVERAL AMENDMENT IN THE

05:06:19.527 --> 05:06:22.397
ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE. SOME

05:06:22.464 --> 05:06:23.198
TAKEN DIRECTLY FROM THE

05:06:23.264 --> 05:06:25.166
OPPOSITION AND OTHERS THAT

05:06:25.233 --> 05:06:26.835
REPRESENT A MIDDLE GROUND TO

05:06:26.901 --> 05:06:28.236
ADDRESS SOME OF THE CORE

05:06:28.303 --> 05:06:29.471
CONCERNS STATED BY THE

05:06:29.537 --> 05:06:32.807
OPPOSITION. IN THE SENATE SHE

05:06:32.874 --> 05:06:34.609
HAS ADDED BACK THE PREDICATE

05:06:34.676 --> 05:06:37.512
OFFENCE OF BURGLARY. QUALIFIED

05:06:37.579 --> 05:06:39.481
ELIMINATES THE DEFINITION OF

05:06:39.547 --> 05:06:41.282
QUOTE BENEFIT MORE THAN

05:06:41.349 --> 05:06:42.984
REPUTATIONAL BY PROVIDING A

05:06:43.051 --> 05:06:44.252
LIST OF EXAMPLES OF WHAT A

05:06:44.319 --> 05:06:46.821
COMMON BENEFIT THAT IS MORE

05:06:46.888 --> 05:06:49.023
THAN REPUTATIONAL MAY INCLUDE.

05:06:49.090 --> 05:06:49.958
AMENDMENTS THAT WERE NOT

05:06:50.024 --> 05:06:51.626
ACCEPTED FOR THOSE THAT WERE

05:06:51.693 --> 05:06:54.496
VAGUE AND RAISE VALID CONCERNS

05:06:54.562 --> 05:06:56.030
THAT WOULD HAVE WATERED THE

05:06:56.097 --> 05:06:58.066
BILL DOWN TO SUCH AN EXTENT.

05:06:58.133 --> 05:06:59.801
THAT WOULD NO LONGER RETAIN ITS

05:06:59.868 --> 05:07:02.303
ORIGINAL INTENT. LET ME BE

05:07:02.370 --> 05:07:07.609
CLEAR. ONCE AGAIN AB THREE

05:07:07.675 --> 05:07:09.144
THREE THREE DOES NOT END GANG

05:07:09.210 --> 05:07:12.881
ENHANCEMENT. IT DOES NOT IMPACT

05:07:12.947 --> 05:07:14.983
THE LIVES OF GANG ENHANCEMENT

05:07:15.049 --> 05:07:17.218
AND IT DOES NOT PREVENT STREET

05:07:17.285 --> 05:07:19.354
LEVEL POLICE INVESTIGATIONS.

05:07:19.420 --> 05:07:21.823
IT'S SIMPLY ASK PROSECUTORS TO

05:07:21.890 --> 05:07:24.292
PROVE THE GANG CHARGES BROUGHT

05:07:24.359 --> 05:07:27.228
AGAINST SOMEONE. IN OTHER WORDS

05:07:27.295 --> 05:07:28.396
IT ASKED PROSECUTORS TO DO

05:07:28.463 --> 05:07:31.766
THEIR JOB. THE SAME ARGUMENTS

05:07:31.833 --> 05:07:33.334
USED PRIOR TO PROVE A GANG

05:07:33.401 --> 05:07:36.571
ENHANCEMENT CAN STILL BE USE SO

05:07:36.638 --> 05:07:37.172
AS LONG AS THEY ARE GERMANE TO

05:07:37.238 --> 05:07:40.008

EVIDENCE. AB THREE THREE THREE

05:07:49.517 --> 05:07:50.985

RELATE TO WITH ALL OF US WE'VE

06:19:47.064 --> 06:19:49.032

IN THIS AREA IN THE AREA OF LOS

06:19:58.909 --> 06:20:00.277
ANGELES THERE WAS SEVERE

06:20:00.344 --> 06:20:01.645
PROBLEMS WITH FRAUD AND IT'S

06:20:01.712 --> 06:20:03.981
BEEN DOCUMENTED. BUT THIS IS A

06:20:04.047 --> 06:20:05.516
HEAVY HANDED APPROACH WHEN WE

06:20:05.582 --> 06:20:07.751
LOOK AT WHAT IT DOES IT'S A

06:20:07.818 --> 06:20:10.420

BELIEVE- GOING FORWARD- THAT IS

06:20:22.232 --> 06:20:25.169
UNBELIEVABLE. IN MY AREA ALONE

06:20:25.235 --> 06:20:26.770

06:20:32.809 --> 06:20:34.811
CREATE ANOTHER SHORTAGE

06:20:34.878 --> 06:20:36.880
COMPOUNDED WE'VE HAD FRAUD AND

06:20:36.947 --> 06:20:38.515

CALIFORNIA WE DON'T STOP AND

06:20:40.684 --> 06:20:42.319
PROVIDE A MORATORIUM WE FIX IT

06:20:42.386 --> 06:20:43.787
AS WE GO BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SO

06:20:43.854 --> 06:20:47.591
DEPENDENT ON THESE SERVICES. NO

06:20:47.658 --> 06:20:48.892
ONE OF THE THINGS WE DO WHEN WE

06:20:48.959 --> 06:20:50.460
COME UP TO SACRAMENTO IS WE

06:20:50.527 --> 06:20:54.865

I PROMISE OF WILL DO NO HARM.

06:20:57.034 --> 06:21:00.204
THIS IS HARMFUL THIS HURTS THE

06:21:00.270 --> 06:21:02.606
ABILITY FOR PATIENTS TO HAVE

06:21:02.673 --> 06:21:04.408

06:21:04.474 --> 06:21:05.576
THAT THEY DESERVE IN THE LATTER

06:21:05.642 --> 06:21:07.744
PART OF THE LIFE AND THE CARE

06:21:07.811 --> 06:21:08.278

THEIR LIFE. AS THEY DESERVE

06:21:23.060 --> 06:21:25.262
THIS IS A HEAVY HANDED APPROACH.

06:21:25.329 --> 06:21:27.197

06:21:27.264 --> 06:21:29.333

A BIGGER DISCUSSION ABOUT

06:21:37.341 --> 06:21:39.876

BEGAN THE YEAR. TO TALK ABOUT

06:36:04.540 --> 06:36:05.041
THIS IS THE YEAR THAT WE DO

06:36:05.108 --> 06:36:09.045
BROADBAND. AND WHEN WE TAKE A

06:36:09.112 --> 06:36:09.645

06:36:11.647 --> 06:36:13.516

WE'VE TALKED AMONGST EACH OTHER

06:36:19.689 --> 06:36:21.290
INDIVIDUALLY AND FOLKS SAY WELL

06:36:21.357 --> 06:36:22.525
WE JUST DID SI BILLION IS NOT

06:36:22.592 --> 06:36:24.026
ENOUGH. BUT YOU REALLY HAVE TO

06:36:24.093 --> 06:36:25.461
TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THAT SIX

06:36:25.528 --> 06:36:28.097
BILLION WHAT'S- THERE WERE

06:36:28.164 --> 06:36:29.999
THREE POINT TWO FIVE. FOUR WITH

06:36:30.066 --> 06:36:33.202
CONSIDER THE MIDDLE MILE. AND

06:36:33.269 --> 06:36:33.836
WE THINK ABOUT THAT THAT'S KIND

06:36:33.903 --> 06:36:35.771
OF LIKE THE HIGHWAY. THE LOAN

06:36:35.838 --> 06:36:38.741
LOSS PROGRAM. THAT THAT USE THE

06:36:38.808 --> 06:36:39.342
OTHER SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY

06:36:39.408 --> 06:36:41.911
MILLION. THOSE ARE KIND OF THE

06:36:41.978 --> 06:36:43.679
OFF RAMP IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

06:36:43.746 --> 06:36:44.647
AND THEN THERE'S THE KIND OF

06:36:44.714 --> 06:36:45.948
THE MEAT AND POTATOES OF WHAT'S

06:36:46.015 --> 06:36:46.782
GOING TO GET US CONNECTED IN

06:36:46.849 --> 06:36:48.317
COMMUNITIES AND THAT LEFT US

06:36:48.384 --> 06:36:50.453
WITH ABOUT TWO BILLION. WE TAKE

06:36:50.520 --> 06:36:51.921
A LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF

06:36:51.988 --> 06:36:52.555
APPLICATIONS CURRENTLY NOW THIS

06:36:52.622 --> 06:36:54.657
U. P. LET'S NOT THIRTY SEVEN

06:36:54.724 --> 06:36:56.759
APPLICATIONS. AND THEY'RE GOING

06:36:56.826 --> 06:36:58.995
TO CONTINUE TO GROW. SO THE

06:36:59.061 --> 06:37:01.464
MONIES WE PASSED WERE A STEP

06:37:01.531 --> 06:37:03.900
TOWARD A BIG STEP BUT ONLY A IN

06:37:03.966 --> 06:37:06.135
AN INVESTMENT ONLY A DOWN

06:37:06.202 --> 06:37:06.769
PAYMENT FOR THE REAL WORK AHEAD

06:37:06.836 --> 06:37:09.005
OF US. I WOULD BE GETTING THIS

06:37:09.071 --> 06:37:10.907
PANDEMIC WE ALL KNEW THAT THE

06:37:10.973 --> 06:37:12.875
INTERNET WAS IMPORTANT. BUT

06:37:12.942 --> 06:37:15.044
WHAT WE SAW WE KIDS HAD TO GO

06:37:15.111 --> 06:37:16.179
HOME AND DISTANCE LEARNING BUT

06:37:16.245 --> 06:37:17.013
THEY DIDN'T HAVE INTERNET

06:37:17.079 --> 06:37:19.048
ACCESS OR ADEQUATE INTERNET

06:37:19.115 --> 06:37:21.751
ACCESS. IT WHAT WE SAW IN SOME

06:37:21.817 --> 06:37:24.287
PARTS OF THE STATE. WITH

06:37:24.353 --> 06:37:26.856
CHILDREN SITTING OUTSIDE OF A

06:37:26.923 --> 06:37:27.423
FAST FOOD PLACES TO CAPTURE

06:37:27.490 --> 06:37:30.159
INTERNET. WHAT WE SAW ALL

06:37:30.226 --> 06:37:34.630
ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WHAT WHAT

06:37:34.697 --> 06:37:36.332
WAS THAT WAS THAT WHETHER

06:37:36.399 --> 06:37:39.802
YOU'RE RICH OR POOR WE'LL URBAN.

06:37:39.869 --> 06:37:42.772
THERE WAS THERE WAS A NECESSITY

06:37:42.838 --> 06:37:44.240
FOR THE INTERNET JUST TO HAVE A

06:37:44.307 --> 06:37:46.442
BASIC EDUCATION. AND THE MANY

06:37:46.509 --> 06:37:49.445
WERE LEFT BEHIND. NOW SOME OF

06:37:49.512 --> 06:37:51.547
US ARE FROM URBAN AREAS AND SO

06:37:51.614 --> 06:37:52.148
WE'VE ALWAYS MADE THE CASE FOR

06:37:52.215 --> 06:37:55.284
URBAN AREAS. BUT WE GOT TO

06:37:55.351 --> 06:37:56.252
DRIVE UP AND DOWN THE STATE

06:37:56.319 --> 06:37:57.587
BECAUSE KOGAN PREVENTED US FROM

06:37:57.653 --> 06:37:59.021
GETTING ON PLANES WE REALLY

06:37:59.088 --> 06:38:00.223
QUICKLY FOUND OUT THAT WE

06:38:00.289 --> 06:38:01.290
COULDN'T HAVE. A LOT OF

06:38:01.357 --> 06:38:03.759
TELEPHONE CONVERSATIONS UP AND

06:38:03.826 --> 06:38:04.327
DOWN THE NINETY NINE UP AND

06:38:04.393 --> 06:38:06.796
DOWN THE FIVE. AND I WAS AN

06:38:06.862 --> 06:38:07.863
INCONVENIENCE BUT I COULD

06:38:07.930 --> 06:38:09.865
IMAGINE LIVING. IN ANY OF THESE

06:38:09.932 --> 06:38:11.267
AREAS AND NOT HAVING ANY WAY TO

06:38:11.334 --> 06:38:17.139
CONNECT. ANYTIME OF THE DAY.

06:38:17.206 --> 06:38:17.773
BUT WHAT WE ALSO FOUND IN URBAN

06:38:17.840 --> 06:38:19.475
AREAS. I'LL TRY TO DISTANCE

06:38:19.542 --> 06:38:22.645
LEARNING. IS THE IMPORTANCE OF

06:38:22.712 --> 06:38:24.647
A TELEHEALTH REPORTS THE

06:38:24.714 --> 06:38:26.115
CONNECT THE LOVED ONES THE

06:38:26.182 --> 06:38:27.883
IMPORTANCE OF WHAT IT MEANT NOW

06:38:27.950 --> 06:38:31.187
TO WORK FROM HOME. SO I WOULD

06:38:31.254 --> 06:38:32.955
ARGUE THAT THIS THIS HAD HIT IN

06:38:33.022 --> 06:38:34.357
IMPACTED LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES

06:38:34.423 --> 06:38:37.026
OF COLOR. WORSE THAN ANY OTHER

06:38:37.093 --> 06:38:38.961
COMMUNITIES BUT WHAT WE FOUND

06:38:39.028 --> 06:38:39.562
OUT THAT IMPACTED EVERYBODY IN

06:38:39.629 --> 06:38:42.098
CALIFORNIA. SO IF WE'RE GOING

06:38:42.164 --> 06:38:43.165
TO GET THIS WORK DONE AND LET'S

06:38:43.232 --> 06:38:44.433
BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT IT WE'VE

06:38:44.500 --> 06:38:45.735
JUST BEGUN TO PUT A DOWN

06:38:45.801 --> 06:38:47.336
PAYMENT. ON THE MONEY IS NEEDED

06:38:47.403 --> 06:38:49.905
TO CONNECT. THIS WILL ACTUALLY

06:38:49.972 --> 06:38:51.374
FULFILL THAT CONVERSATION THAT

06:38:51.440 --> 06:38:52.541
WE BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING OF

06:38:52.608 --> 06:38:54.543
THE- YEAR THAT SAID WE ARE

06:38:54.610 --> 06:38:55.177
GOING TO DO BROADBAND INTERNET

06:38:55.244 --> 06:38:56.512
CONNECTION FOR ALL. BECAUSE

06:38:56.579 --> 06:38:57.613
WE'RE GONNA NEED A LOT MORE

06:38:57.680 --> 06:38:59.782
WORK. AND WHAT THIS ALLOWS US

06:38:59.849 --> 06:39:00.316
TO DO BECAUSE REMEMBER THE

06:39:00.383 --> 06:39:02.218
FEDERAL FUNDS IN. TWENTY TWENTY

06:39:02.285 --> 06:39:04.520
SIX. WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE

06:39:04.587 --> 06:39:07.556
TO COMPLETE CONNECTION TO EVERY

06:39:07.623 --> 06:39:10.126
HOUSEHOLD EVERY SMALL BUSINESS.

06:39:10.192 --> 06:39:11.827
AT EVERY MEDICAL FACILITY ALL

06:39:11.894 --> 06:39:12.828
THE THINGS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

06:39:12.895 --> 06:39:13.929
GET DONE THAT WE SET ARE SO

06:39:13.996 --> 06:39:15.598
IMPORTANT. THAT WE WILL SAID IN

06:39:15.665 --> 06:39:17.166
SPEECHES THAT EVERYBODY THAT IS

06:39:17.233 --> 06:39:18.134
SO IMPORTANT THAT WE'VE ALL

06:39:18.200 --> 06:39:20.303
TALKED ABOUT ON THE FLOOR

06:39:20.369 --> 06:39:20.870
THERE'S STILL IMPORT. IF WE

06:39:20.936 --> 06:39:25.041
DON'T GET THIS DONE. CONTINUE

06:39:25.107 --> 06:39:30.346
THAT WORK FOR THE NEXT DECADE.

06:39:30.413 --> 06:39:33.382
AND HOPEFULLY IF THIS GETS OUT.

06:39:33.449 --> 06:39:36.152
AND A COMPANION BILL GETS OUT.

06:39:36.218 --> 06:39:37.820
WELL NOT ONLY FULFILLED A DOWN

06:39:37.887 --> 06:39:39.622
PAYMENT BUT WE WILL WE WILL

06:39:39.689 --> 06:39:42.024
HAVE INVESTED TO TAKE CARE OF

06:39:42.091 --> 06:39:42.591
ALL THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE

06:39:42.658 --> 06:39:46.062
SAID THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO US.

06:39:46.128 --> 06:39:48.397
NOT I CAN'T EMPHASIZE ENOUGH

06:39:48.464 --> 06:39:52.968
THAT IN OUR COMMUNITIES. M. AND

06:39:53.035 --> 06:39:53.536
I'M GONNA LOOK AT LONGER BUT

06:39:53.602 --> 06:39:55.438
THIS IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT.

06:39:55.504 --> 06:39:57.173
IN OUR COMMUNITIES. WE WERE

06:39:57.239 --> 06:39:59.141
DEVASTATED WITH THE INABILITY

06:39:59.208 --> 06:40:00.976
FOR KIDS TO GET DISTANCE

06:40:01.043 --> 06:40:01.610
LEARNING BECAUSE IT WAS JUST NO

06:40:01.677 --> 06:40:05.815
CONNECTION. BUT THEY WERE ALSO

06:40:05.881 --> 06:40:07.249
DEVASTATED WITH PEOPLE TO HAVE

06:40:07.316 --> 06:40:08.951
THE INABILITY TO VISIT A

06:40:09.018 --> 06:40:13.122
DOCTOR. OR NURSE. NOW WILL NEW

06:40:13.189 --> 06:40:15.858
ABOUT TELEHEALTH. BUT PEOPLE

06:40:15.925 --> 06:40:18.861
DIDN'T HAVE THE WAY TO DO IT. I

06:40:18.928 --> 06:40:21.330
CAN'T EMPHASIZE ENOUGH. THAT

06:40:21.397 --> 06:40:23.399
THAT THAT THIS IS PROBABLY ONE

06:40:23.466 --> 06:40:23.966
OF THE MOST SINGLE IMPORTANT

06:40:24.033 --> 06:40:26.235

SEE MAKING SURE THAT THEY MOVE

06:45:43.085 --> 06:45:45.921
APPLICATIONS IN A TIMELY MANNER

06:45:45.988 --> 06:45:47.189

06:45:53.996 --> 06:45:56.298
INVESTMENT MOVING FORWARD AS A

06:45:56.365 --> 06:45:58.467
FREE WAY IF WE ARE CLOGGED UP

06:45:58.534 --> 06:46:01.103
BECAUSE OF TRAFFIC LITERALLY

06:46:01.170 --> 06:46:02.538
WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE THESE

06:46:02.604 --> 06:46:05.808
CONNECTIONS. THE LAST THING

06:46:05.874 --> 06:46:08.510
THAT I WANT TO SEE. MEMBERS I

APOLOGIZE. BUT IS ANOTHER HIGH

06:46:12.181 --> 06:46:14.817
SPEED RAIL SCENARIO WHERE WE

06:46:14.883 --> 06:46:16.785
MAKE AN INVESTMENT AND WE DON'T

06:46:16.852 --> 06:46:18.687
SEE THAT INVESTMENT COME

06:46:18.754 --> 06:46:22.725
FORWARD. ALL OF US WERE STUNNED

06:46:22.791 --> 06:46:24.259
WHEN WE SAW THOSE TWO YOUNG

06:46:24.326 --> 06:46:26.328
GIRLS SITTING OUT IN FRONT OF A

06:46:26.395 --> 06:46:29.898
TACO BELL. A PICTURE SPEAKS A

06:46:29.965 --> 06:46:33.469
MILE THOUSAND WORDS. AND WE

06:46:33.535 --> 06:46:34.603
KNOW THAT WE NEED THIS

06:46:34.670 --> 06:46:36.472
CONNECTIVITY BUT LET ME BE

06:46:36.538 --> 06:46:38.507
CLEAR AS A CLASSROOM TEACHER

06:46:38.574 --> 06:46:42.010
EQUITY. ANY QUALITY ARE TWO

06:46:42.077 --> 06:46:43.946
DIFFERENT THINGS THAT MEANS WE

06:46:44.012 --> 06:46:46.515
MUST INVEST IN THE AREAS THAT

06:46:46.582 --> 06:46:48.817
ARE NOT CONNECTED FIRST. WE

06:46:48.884 --> 06:46:50.352
MUST MAKE SURE THAT THOSE

06:46:50.419 --> 06:46:52.821
CONNECTIONS GET MOVE FORWARD

06:46:52.888 --> 06:46:55.023

ACCOUNTABLE AND MOVE SWIFTLY

06:46:58.861 --> 06:47:00.462
AND THAT'S WHY SUPPORT THIS

06:47:00.529 --> 06:47:02.264
BECAUSE SIX BILLION IS A HUGE

06:47:02.331 --> 06:47:04.233
INVESTMENT. BUT IT IS NO

06:47:04.299 --> 06:47:06.535
INVESTMENT AT ALL IF WE CANNOT

06:56:37.639 --> 06:56:39.174
ADDING UP ALL THE TAXES AND

06:56:39.240 --> 06:56:41.276
FEES ON INTERNET. PRETTY MUCH

06:56:41.343 --> 06:56:43.111
THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT ANYWAY SO

06:56:43.178 --> 06:56:46.114
THEY WON'T HAVE BROADBAND. SO

06:56:46.181 --> 06:56:48.116
THAT'S THAT'S THE REAL ISSUE IS

06:56:48.183 --> 06:56:49.884
HOW DO WE PAY FOR IT. SO THAT

06:56:49.951 --> 06:56:52.020
THEY CAN BE INCLUDED. SO THAT

06:56:52.087 --> 06:56:53.421
IT DOESN'T MAKE THE CAR DRIVE

06:56:53.488 --> 06:56:55.290
THE COST UP SO MUCH OF THEIR

06:56:55.357 --> 06:56:57.892
PARENTS CAN'T EVEN AFFORD IT.

06:56:57.959 --> 06:56:59.294
AND THEN THE ALL HAVE ACCESS TO

06:56:59.361 --> 06:57:00.995
IT. WE NEED TO MAKE THAT OF

06:57:01.062 --> 06:57:02.097
THAT INVESTMENT IN THE

06:57:02.163 --> 06:57:04.032
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S PART OF

06:57:04.099 --> 06:57:05.600
THE INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT'S WHAT

06:57:05.667 --> 06:57:07.268
WE HAVE TO PAY FOR WITH THE

06:57:07.335 --> 06:57:09.237
MONEY THAT WE ALREADY HAVE. SO

06:57:09.304 --> 06:57:10.638
THAT'S WHERE I THINK THE DEBATE

06:57:10.705 --> 06:57:12.807
REALLY SHOULD BE. AND INSTEAD

06:57:12.874 --> 06:57:14.509
IT'S IT SOUNDS LIKE THE- WORK

06:57:14.576 --> 06:57:16.077
WE'RE DEBATING THAT IF WE DON'T

06:57:16.144 --> 06:57:17.645
WANT TO VOTE FOR THIS IT'S

06:57:17.712 --> 06:57:19.147
BECAUSE WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THE

06:57:19.214 --> 06:57:20.548
KIDS AND WE DON'T. REALLY WANT

06:57:20.615 --> 06:57:23.785
TO ENTER THE BROADBAND BROUGHT

06:57:23.852 --> 06:57:24.419
TO THEM WHEN THAT'S NOT TRUE AT

06:57:24.486 --> 06:57:27.389
ALL. WHAT'S TRUE IS. HOW DO WE

06:57:27.455 --> 06:57:29.424
PAY FOR WE HAVE THE MONEY. WE

06:57:29.491 --> 06:57:30.925
SHOULD HAVE PUT THAT MONEY TO

06:57:30.992 --> 06:57:33.261
WORK DOING EXACTLY THIS BECAUSE

06:57:33.328 --> 06:57:34.829
THIS IS A PRIORITY FOR EVERYONE

06:57:54.449 --> 06:57:57.051
THINGS THAT HAPPEN OUT OF

06:57:57.118 --> 06:57:57.585
SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE THE YOU

06:57:57.652 --> 06:57:59.187
DON'T MAY MAYBE THOUGHT ABOUT.

06:57:59.254 --> 06:58:00.922

06:58:04.426 --> 06:58:06.528
PAST COUPLE YEARS. BUT THE

06:58:06.594 --> 06:58:07.529
THING THAT I WANT TO KEEP

06:58:07.595 --> 06:58:08.830
COMING BACK BECAUSE PEOPLE KEEP

06:58:08.897 --> 06:58:10.598
THROWING IT IN MY FACE IS THE

06:58:10.665 --> 06:58:13.101
SIX POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS.

06:58:13.168 --> 06:58:13.902
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER

06:58:13.968 --> 06:58:15.737
DONE A INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT.

06:58:15.804 --> 06:58:18.273
MANY OF YOU'VE DONE ONE. MAYBE

06:58:18.339 --> 06:58:18.907

EXPENSIVE. AND HOW YOU GO OUT

06:58:21.075 --> 06:58:22.644
TO BID WHAT THEY ARE TODAY IS

06:58:22.710 --> 06:58:23.211
NOT WHAT THEY'RE GOING INTO

06:58:23.278 --> 06:58:25.246
BEING. SO THE SIX POINT FIVE

06:58:25.313 --> 06:58:26.948
BILLION DOLLARS TO ME IS JUST

06:58:27.015 --> 06:58:30.952

DAY THEY'RE SAYING YOU CAN NOT

06:58:35.323 --> 06:58:39.227
GET FIBER. THE SUPPLY CHAIN IS

06:58:39.294 --> 06:58:41.329
BROKEN MAYBE WE SHOULD THINK

06:58:41.396 --> 06:58:42.764
ABOUT DOING A BILL ABOUT MAKING

06:58:42.831 --> 06:58:44.165

PRICE OF OUR PROJECTS GOING TO

06:58:50.305 --> 06:58:53.041
GO UP. SO THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE

06:58:53.107 --> 06:58:55.543
TO THINK ABOUT. LET'S NOT BE

06:58:55.610 --> 06:58:56.778

RECYCLABLE I AGREE WITH THE

08:59:59.767 --> 09:00:01.902
MEMBER FROM SAN DIEGO I THINK

09:00:01.969 --> 09:00:03.471
THIS IS VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD

09:00:03.537 --> 09:00:06.340

PLASTICS ARE RECYCLED AND PART

09:00:24.859 --> 09:00:25.926
OF THAT IS BECAUSE IT'S OFTEN

09:00:25.993 --> 09:00:28.829
UNCLEAR TO CONSUMERS WHAT IS

09:00:28.896 --> 09:00:30.931
AND WHAT IS NOT RECYCLABLE WITH

TODAY IN OPPOSITION SB SIX

09:06:08.035 --> 09:06:08.569
THIRTY NINE. AND I WANT TO BE

09:06:08.635 --> 09:06:10.104
CLEAR HOWEVER THAT THERE ARE

09:06:10.170 --> 09:06:10.804
SOME VERY GOOD THINGS ABOUT

09:06:10.871 --> 09:06:12.906
THIS BILL. BUT IT CONTAINS A

09:06:12.973 --> 09:06:15.042
FATAL FLAW ONE THAT REQUIRES AN

09:06:15.109 --> 09:06:17.945
EXPLANATION. FIRST THE NOTION

09:06:18.011 --> 09:06:18.779
THAT WE OUGHT TO PASS THE

09:06:18.846 --> 09:06:20.747
DEPARTMENT. OF DEVELOPMENTAL

09:06:20.814 --> 09:06:21.915
SERVICES TO COME UP WITH THE

09:06:21.982 --> 09:06:24.151
PLAN. UNDER WHICH PEOPLE WITH

09:06:24.218 --> 09:06:24.918
INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL

09:06:24.985 --> 09:06:26.787
DISABILITIES COULD MAKE MINIMUM

09:06:26.854 --> 09:06:29.056
WAGE OR HIGHER WHEN THEY'RE

09:06:29.123 --> 09:06:31.158
WORKING IS A TERRIFIC IDEA. AS

09:06:31.225 --> 09:06:34.128
IT STANDS TODAY PEOPLE WITH IBD

09:06:34.194 --> 09:06:36.163
WORK IN JOBS WHERE THEY WORK

09:06:36.230 --> 09:06:39.066
VERY INDEPENDENTLY MAKE WAGES

09:06:39.133 --> 09:06:39.633
THAT ARE HIGHER THAN MINIMUM

09:06:39.700 --> 09:06:42.603
WAGE. THERE ARE SOME HOWEVER

09:06:42.669 --> 09:06:43.704
THE SOLELY BECAUSE OF THEIR

09:06:43.770 --> 09:06:45.305
INTELLECTUAL OR DEVELOPMENTAL

09:06:45.372 --> 09:06:48.275
DISABILITY. CANNOT COMPETE IN

09:06:48.342 --> 09:06:49.042
MANY JOBS BECAUSE OF

09:06:49.109 --> 09:06:51.111
PRODUCTIVITY DOESN'T MEET THE

09:06:51.178 --> 09:06:52.379
STANDARDS OF THE COMPETITIVE

09:06:52.446 --> 09:06:55.149
MARKETPLACE. THOSE PEOPLE

09:06:55.215 --> 09:06:57.184
LITERALLY MEET THE STANDARDS OF

09:06:57.251 --> 09:06:58.852
THE FEDERAL FAIR LABOR

09:06:58.919 --> 09:07:01.155
STANDARDS ACT THAT ALLOWS THEM

09:07:01.221 --> 09:07:04.458
BY CHOICE. TO TAKE A JOB THAT

09:07:04.525 --> 09:07:06.760
PAYS LESS THAN MINIMUM WAGE.

09:07:06.827 --> 09:07:07.961
THE OTHER PART OF THELAW

09:07:08.028 --> 09:07:08.929
REQUIRES THAT THEY EXPRESSED

09:07:08.996 --> 09:07:10.430
THIS CHOICE TO THE

09:07:10.497 --> 09:07:12.599
INDIVIDUALIZED PROGRAM PLAN OR

09:07:12.666 --> 09:07:15.602
KNOWN AS THE I. P. P. THAT IS

09:07:15.669 --> 09:07:16.170
DEVELOPED WITH THE REGIONAL

09:07:16.236 --> 09:07:18.572
CENTER. THE FEDERAL LAW FURTHER

09:07:18.639 --> 09:07:20.307
REQUIRES THAT THEIR

09:07:20.374 --> 09:07:22.709
PRODUCTIVITY IN THE JOB. BE

09:07:22.776 --> 09:07:24.745
REMEASURED EVERY SIX MONTHS.

09:07:24.811 --> 09:07:25.846
AND OTHER PRODUCTIVITY

09:07:25.913 --> 09:07:28.982
INCREASES SO MUST OUR PAY.

09:07:29.049 --> 09:07:30.984
ADDITIONALLY IF THE PAY FOR

09:07:31.051 --> 09:07:33.687
THAT POSITION GOES UP THEIR PAY

09:07:33.754 --> 09:07:36.023
MUST ALSO BE INCREASED AS WELL.

09:07:36.089 --> 09:07:37.891
THE FATAL FLAW THIS BILL IS

09:07:37.958 --> 09:07:39.159
THAT IT ALSO SAYS THE PEOPLE

09:07:39.226 --> 09:07:41.328
WITH IBD MAKING LESS THAN

09:07:41.395 --> 09:07:42.963
MINIMUM WAGE CAN NO LONGER DO

09:07:43.030 --> 09:07:46.266
THAT PASSED JANUARY. ONE OF

09:07:46.333 --> 09:07:46.900
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE OR POSSIBLY

09:07:46.967 --> 09:07:49.403
LATER THE DEPARTMENT TAKES

09:07:49.469 --> 09:07:50.737
LONGER TO DEVELOP A PLAN.

09:07:50.804 --> 09:07:53.674
MEMBERS WE SHOULD ASK THE

09:07:53.740 --> 09:07:54.841
DEPARTMENT TO SEE IF THERE'S A

09:07:54.908 --> 09:07:56.777
WAY THAT ALL PEOPLE WITH

09:07:56.843 --> 09:07:58.378
ALREADY WORKING TO MAKE MINIMUM

09:07:58.445 --> 09:08:01.381
WAGE OR HIGHER. IN FACT THERE

09:08:01.448 --> 09:08:03.684
ARE WAYS TO MAKE THIS WORK. WE

09:08:03.750 --> 09:08:05.719
COULD SUBSIDIZE THE SUBSIDIZE

09:08:05.786 --> 09:08:07.854
THE GAP BETWEEN PRODUCTIVITY

09:08:07.921 --> 09:08:09.456
WAGE UNDER FEDERAL LAW AND

09:08:09.523 --> 09:08:12.125
MINIMUM WAGE. WE CAN ALSO DO AS

09:08:12.192 --> 09:08:13.560
OUR COLLEAGUE BRIAN MAIENSCHEIN

09:08:13.627 --> 09:08:16.997
PROPOSED TWICE. TWO TIMES. HE

09:08:17.064 --> 09:08:18.799
PROPOSED A BILL OFFERING

09:08:18.865 --> 09:08:20.667
EMPLOYERS WITH THE TAX CREDIT

09:08:20.734 --> 09:08:21.935
TO PAY MINIMUM WAGE TO THEIR

09:08:22.002 --> 09:08:24.037
WORKERS WITH IDT EVEN THOUGH

09:08:24.104 --> 09:08:25.639
THEY COULD BE PAID LESS UNDER

09:08:25.706 --> 09:08:28.508
FEDERAL LAW. BOTH TIMES THIS

09:08:28.575 --> 09:08:30.544
BILL WAS HELD APPROPRIATIONS.

09:08:30.611 --> 09:08:32.479
AFTER PASSING UNANIMOUSLY IN

09:08:32.546 --> 09:08:34.214
THE REVENUE TAX COMMITTEE. THE

09:08:34.281 --> 09:08:37.751

THE SAME AND HAVE THE SAME

09:08:41.822 --> 09:08:46.693
HOLDING. OF THE MICE. THE FACT

09:08:46.760 --> 09:08:47.761
IS THAT THIS BILL IS PASSED AS

09:08:47.828 --> 09:08:50.464
IS THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT

09:08:50.530 --> 09:08:53.400
TWELVE THOUSAND PEOPLE. WITH

09:08:53.467 --> 09:08:54.268
IDT WILL LOSE THEIR CURRENT

09:08:54.334 --> 09:08:56.370
JOBS THAT THEY HAVE CHOSEN TO

09:08:56.436 --> 09:08:58.839
BE WORKING IN. AND ARE APPROVED

09:08:58.905 --> 09:09:03.744
IN THE I. P. P. SITTING

09:09:03.810 --> 09:09:06.346
IS THAT A TWO THOUSAND

09:09:06.413 --> 09:09:07.014
THIRTEEN. A BILL DECLARING

09:09:07.080 --> 09:09:08.448
EMPLOYMENT TO THE HIGHEST

09:09:08.515 --> 09:09:10.117
PRIORITY OF THE STATE OF

DISCRIMINATION. WE DON'T ALLOW

IN WAGES EITHER WE DON'T TREAT

09:29:06.345 --> 09:29:07.146

09:29:14.987 --> 09:29:15.821
COLLEAGUE MENTIONED FROM THE

THIS OUT IMPLEMENTATION AND WE

09:29:18.691 --> 09:29:20.292
CAN WE SHOULD GET THIS RIGHT.

09:29:20.359 --> 09:29:21.460
BECAUSE TWELVE THOUSAND PEOPLE

09:29:21.527 --> 09:29:23.028
WORKING RIGHT NOW TO BE ALLOWED

09:29:23.095 --> 09:29:24.129

TO CALIFORNIA. WHO NEED JOBS

09:29:29.201 --> 09:29:30.803
THERE'S WORK FOR US TO DO. BUT

09:29:30.870 --> 09:29:32.204
I STAND IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL

09:29:32.271 --> 09:29:32.905
BECAUSE WE DON'T PAY PEOPLE

09:29:32.972 --> 09:29:34.807
LESS. BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT

09:29:34.874 --> 09:29:36.041
THEY ARE LESS ABLE WE DON'T

09:29:36.108 --> 09:29:41.080
NOTICE THE MONEY'S WORTH. BASED

09:29:41.146 --> 09:29:42.515
ON THE ECONOMIC PRODUCTIVITY.

09:29:42.581 --> 09:29:43.916
THERE IS BRYANT SEEN DISCUSSION

09:29:43.983 --> 09:29:46.585
OR TO. REMAINING MS GONZALEZ

09:29:46.652 --> 09:29:49.188
YOU MAY CLOSE I WANT TO FIRST

09:29:49.255 --> 09:29:50.589
RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS AN

09:29:50.656 --> 09:29:52.958
EMOTIONAL TOPIC. AND IT'S A

09:29:53.025 --> 09:29:54.927
TOPIC IN A AREA THAT I'VE

09:29:54.994 --> 09:29:57.630
WORKED ON FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS

09:29:57.696 --> 09:29:59.665
ON BEHALF OF THE DISABLED

09:29:59.732 --> 09:30:03.402
COMMUNITY. SO OFTEN OUR

09:30:03.469 --> 09:30:05.571
APPROACH TO THE SUBJECT MAY

09:30:05.638 --> 09:30:08.974
TURN ON. THOSE WORKERS WHO

09:30:09.041 --> 09:30:12.978
WE'VE HAD CONTACT WITH. SO THE

09:30:13.045 --> 09:30:15.414
LEVEL OF FUNCTIONING FOR SOME

09:30:15.481 --> 09:30:19.251
DISABLED WORKERS. IS HIGHER AND

09:30:19.318 --> 09:30:21.887
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT TODAY

09:30:21.954 --> 09:30:22.521
AND THEY'RE BEING ABUSED BY THE

09:30:22.588 --> 09:30:25.257
SYSTEM AND THEY CONTINUED TO BE

09:30:25.324 --> 09:30:27.026
ABUSED BY THE SYSTEM SINCE THE

09:30:27.092 --> 09:30:28.761
NINETEEN THIRTIES THAT'S WHEN

09:30:28.827 --> 09:30:30.963
THIS WAS ESTABLISHED. AND I

09:30:31.030 --> 09:30:32.097
UNDERSTAND THERE ARE OTHERS WHO

09:30:32.164 --> 09:30:35.734
FEAR. CAPS BECAUSE OF THE

09:30:35.801 --> 09:30:37.336
CAPABILITIES OF THE PEOPLE

09:30:37.403 --> 09:30:39.171
THERE ADVOCATING FOR THAT

09:30:39.238 --> 09:30:42.474
THEY'LL GO WITHOUT. BUT I HEARD

09:30:42.541 --> 09:30:44.643
SOME THINGS ON THIS FLOOR THAT

09:30:44.710 --> 09:30:45.244
LEAVE ME A LITTLE DISTURBED AS

09:30:45.311 --> 09:30:48.747
WELL. THESE ARE CHILDREN THESE

09:30:48.814 --> 09:30:53.886
ARE ADULTS. THESE ARE OFTEN

09:30:53.953 --> 09:30:56.355
FUNCTIONING ADULTS WITH THEIR

09:30:56.422 --> 09:30:57.489
OWN APARTMENTS WITH THEIR OWN

09:30:57.556 --> 09:31:01.093
LIVELIHOOD. AND WE HAVE GROUPED

09:31:01.160 --> 09:31:03.762
THEM ALL TOGETHER AND ALLOW

09:31:03.829 --> 09:31:06.765
EMPLOYERS TO PAY LESS THAN THE

09:31:06.832 --> 09:31:07.933
MINIMUM WAGE AND I WANT TO

09:31:08.000 --> 09:31:08.801
THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A MINUTE

09:31:08.867 --> 09:31:09.702
BECAUSE WE'VE ALL HEARD THE

09:31:09.768 --> 09:31:11.737
STORIES RIGHT NOW TO DATE

09:31:11.804 --> 09:31:14.807
TODAY. THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYERS

09:31:14.873 --> 09:31:17.876
WHO CANNOT FIND WORKERS TO FILL

09:31:17.943 --> 09:31:20.446
THEIR MINIMUM WAGE JOBS. AND

09:31:20.512 --> 09:31:23.115
YET WE'RE SANE- BUT IT'S

09:31:23.182 --> 09:31:24.450
COMPETITIVE AND THEY'RE NOT

09:31:24.516 --> 09:31:25.651
GOING TO PICK SOMEBODY WITH

09:31:25.718 --> 09:31:28.787
DISABILITIES. SOME PEOPLE AND

09:31:28.854 --> 09:31:29.888
CONGRESS WILL SAY THAT'S WHY WE

09:31:29.955 --> 09:31:31.290
NEED TO BE BRING MORE PEOPLE

09:31:31.357 --> 09:31:33.192
OVER IN A VISA RIGHT BECAUSE WE

09:31:33.258 --> 09:31:35.094
CAN'T FILL OUR MINIMUM WAGE JOB

09:31:35.160 --> 09:31:36.195
SO WE'RE GONNA BE WE'RE GONNA

09:31:36.261 --> 09:31:38.931
BRING PEOPLE FROM A COUNTRY

09:31:38.998 --> 09:31:40.032
WHERE THAT SEEMS LIKE A BETTER

09:31:40.099 --> 09:31:42.134
WAGE. WHEN WE HAVE WORKERS

09:31:42.201 --> 09:31:44.903
DOING THE WORK HERE TODAY WHO

09:31:44.970 --> 09:31:46.805
AREN'T BEING PAID A MINIMUM

09:31:46.872 --> 09:31:49.975
WAGE. SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH

09:31:50.042 --> 09:31:53.112
THE WAY WE'RE VIEWING. ADULT

09:31:53.178 --> 09:31:54.847
INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK WITH

09:31:54.913 --> 09:31:59.485
DISABILITIES. I UNDERSTAND WE

09:31:59.551 --> 09:32:01.553
NEED MORE PROGRAMS I UNDERSTAND

09:32:01.620 --> 09:32:03.222
THAT EVERY INDIVIDUAL NEEDS TO

09:32:03.288 --> 09:32:05.290
FEEL FULFILLED BY WHATEVER IT

09:32:05.357 --> 09:32:07.192
IS THEY'RE DOING IN THAT DAY.

09:32:07.259 --> 09:32:08.293
WHETHER THEY'RE WORKING FOR A

09:32:08.360 --> 09:32:10.295
PAYCHECK WHETHER THEY'RE DOING

09:32:10.362 --> 09:32:11.330
VOLUNTEER WORK WHETHER THEY'RE

09:32:11.397 --> 09:32:14.333
DOING ACTIVITIES AND WE NEED TO

09:32:14.400 --> 09:32:16.402
INVEST IN THOSE PROGRAMS SO

09:32:16.468 --> 09:32:19.672
THAT EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA

09:32:19.738 --> 09:32:21.940
HAS. A FIELD DAY. WHAT WE'RE

09:32:22.007 --> 09:32:24.176
TALKING ABOUT IS WORK IN THE

09:32:24.243 --> 09:32:26.211
DIGNITY OF WORK. AND THE

09:32:26.278 --> 09:32:28.247
DIGNITY OF SHOWING UP EVERY DAY

09:32:28.313 --> 09:32:31.250
AND DOING A JOB THAT HAS TO BE

09:32:31.316 --> 09:32:34.620
DONE BY SOMEBODY. IN EXPECTING

09:32:34.687 --> 09:32:36.822
THAT EMPLOYERS PAY THE VERY

09:32:36.889 --> 09:32:41.427
LEAST. A MINIMUM WAGE. IT IS

09:32:41.493 --> 09:32:45.030
NOT NINETEEN THIRTY ANY MORE.

09:32:45.097 --> 09:32:46.865
IT IS TIME WE STEPPED UP TO

09:32:46.932 --> 09:32:48.300
THOSE PROGRESSIVE STATES LIKE

09:32:48.367 --> 09:32:50.502
TEXAS AND ALASKA AND START

09:32:50.569 --> 09:32:52.805
PAYING PEOPLE FOR THE WORK THAT

09:32:52.871 --> 09:32:54.940
THEY'RE DOING. THIS IS NOT A

09:32:55.007 --> 09:32:56.975
PARTISAN ISSUE GETTING RID OF

09:32:57.042 --> 09:32:58.811
THE SUB MINIMUM WAGE IS BOTH IN

09:32:58.877 --> 09:33:00.746
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THE

09:33:00.813 --> 09:33:02.948
REPUBLICAN PARTY PLATFORMS IT

09:33:03.015 --> 09:33:03.749
IS SOMETHING WE HAVE BEEN

09:33:03.816 --> 09:33:05.884
LOOKING OUT FOR YEARS SOMETHING

09:33:05.951 --> 09:33:08.120
WE'VE ALL SAID IS IMPORTANT. IT

09:33:08.187 --> 09:33:09.388
IS SOMETHING THAT HAS ALWAYS

09:33:09.455 --> 09:33:11.457
BEEN IN CONFLICT WITH THE

09:33:11.523 --> 09:33:13.125
AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT.

09:33:13.192 --> 09:33:14.526
I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE TO

09:33:14.593 --> 09:33:15.961
CONTINUE AND WE HAVE ADVOCATES

09:33:16.028 --> 09:33:17.362
ON THE FOR THAT WILL CONTINUE

09:33:17.429 --> 09:33:19.331
TO PUSH FOR MORE PROGRAMS FOR

09:33:19.398 --> 09:33:21.500
BETTER PROGRAMS FOR OUR ENTIRE

09:33:21.567 --> 09:33:25.504
IT COMMUNITY. BUT THERE THIS

09:33:25.571 --> 09:33:27.473
BILL WAS SPONSORED BY. AND

09:33:27.539 --> 09:33:29.842
ADVOCATED FOR BY PEOPLE WITH

09:33:29.908 --> 09:33:31.310
DISABILITIES WHO ARE IN SUB

09:33:31.376 --> 09:33:34.279
MINIMUM WAGE JOBS. THERE ARE

09:33:34.346 --> 09:33:36.582
PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING HURT BY

09:33:36.648 --> 09:33:38.650
THE FOURTEEN C. EXEMPTION AND

09:33:38.717 --> 09:33:39.451
FEDERAL LAW THAT'S WHAT THEY

09:33:39.518 --> 09:33:42.020
THEY APPLY UNDER. AND IT'S TIME

09:33:42.087 --> 09:33:44.490
WE LIFT EVERYBODY UP AND THEN

09:33:44.556 --> 09:33:47.593
FIGURE OUT WHO ELSE WE HAVE TO-

09:33:47.659 --> 09:33:49.695

PROGRAMS FOR SPEND MORE MONEY

09:33:51.563 --> 09:33:53.832
ON I'M FOR THAT. BUT LEAVING

PEOPLE IN A SUB MINIMUM WAGE

09:33:56.135 --> 09:33:58.670
JOB WITHOUT THE DIGNITY KNOWING

09:33:58.737 --> 09:34:00.272
AND THEY KNOW THIS IS NOT

09:34:00.339 --> 09:34:01.974
PEOPLE WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND

09:34:02.040 --> 09:34:03.208
THAT THEY'RE NOT GETTING PAID A

09:34:03.275 --> 09:34:04.510
MINIMUM WAGE THEY KNOW THAT CAN

09:34:04.576 --> 09:34:06.178
YOU IMAGINE CAN YOU IMAGINE

09:34:06.245 --> 09:34:07.713
GOING TO WORK EVERY SINGLE DAY

09:34:07.780 --> 09:34:09.148
IN YOUR DOING THE JOB SOMEBODY

09:34:09.214 --> 09:34:10.649
PUT IN FRONT OF YOU YOU KNOW

09:34:10.716 --> 09:34:11.750
YOU'RE DOING IT AND YOU KNOW

09:34:11.817 --> 09:34:12.951

09:34:13.018 --> 09:34:15.020
THE LAW SAYS YOU PAID ABLE

09:34:15.087 --> 09:34:17.890
PEOPLE TO DO. THINK ABOUT THAT

09:34:17.956 --> 09:34:19.825
DIGNITY. THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT

09:34:19.892 --> 09:34:21.260
DOES TO THE PSYCHE OF AN

09:34:21.326 --> 09:34:22.995
INDIVIDUAL WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT

09:34:23.061 --> 09:34:25.564
AND THEY DO. THESE ARE NOT

09:34:25.631 --> 09:34:28.267
CHILDREN. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO

09:34:28.333 --> 09:34:30.169
ARE DIFFERENTLY ABLED. AND I

09:34:30.235 --> 09:34:31.770
THINK THEY DESERVE A MINIMUM

OF THE JUDGE WHETHER OR NOT TO

09:49:47.251 --> 09:49:48.820
REMOVE THE ENHANCEMENTS. THE

09:49:48.886 --> 09:49:50.755
COURT IS TO LOOK AT THINGS LIKE

09:49:50.822 --> 09:49:52.824
UNDERLYING TRAUMA. MENTAL

09:49:52.890 --> 09:49:55.693

DOES LOOK AT WHEN DECIDING WHAT

09:49:57.462 --> 09:49:59.330
THE APPROPRIATE SENTENCE IS.

09:50:02.800 --> 09:50:05.570
VERY CLEAR. THAT THE COURT CAN

09:50:05.636 --> 09:50:07.338
AND DOES UNDER THIS BILL LOOK

09:50:07.405 --> 09:50:09.273
AT. WHETHER THE DISMISSAL OF

09:50:09.340 --> 09:50:11.175
THE ENHANCEMENT WOULD ENDANGER

09:50:11.242 --> 09:50:12.877
PUBLIC SAFETY. AND IF IT

09:50:12.944 --> 09:50:14.412
DOESN'T ENTER PUBLIC SAFETY

09:50:14.479 --> 09:50:16.581
THEN THE COURT IS ENTITLED TO.

09:50:16.647 --> 09:50:19.917
AN TO WELL UNDER THIS BILL. PUT

CRIME. SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES

09:50:22.787 --> 09:50:25.556
MEMBERS IT ASKS A JUDGE TO LOOK

09:50:25.623 --> 09:50:27.091

FREEDOM. AND IF THE ANSWER IS

09:50:34.432 --> 09:50:35.566
YES THE JUDGE MAY GIVE THEM BUT

09:50:35.633 --> 09:50:37.301
IF. IT WOULD BE RACIALLY

09:50:37.368 --> 09:50:39.771
UNJUST. IF THE PERSON SUFFERS

09:50:39.837 --> 09:50:41.472
FROM MENTAL ILLNESS THEN THE

09:50:41.539 --> 09:50:43.341

09:50:43.407 --> 09:50:45.209
REMOVE THOSE ENHANCEMENTS. WITH

ELIMINATE ANY ENHANCEMENTS AND

09:50:55.186 --> 09:50:56.120
IT DOES NOT LIMIT JUDICIAL
