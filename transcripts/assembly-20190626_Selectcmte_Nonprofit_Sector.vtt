THE NONPROFIT COMMUNITY.

00:46:57.414 --> 00:46:58.916
SARCHIE POINT TODAY'S THIS

00:46:58.982 --> 00:47:00.984
GOVERNMENT RELIES ON NON PROFITS

00:47:01.051 --> 00:47:02.252
TO DELIVER SERVICES.

00:47:02.319 --> 00:47:04.888
AS JUST ONE EXAMPLE ONE THIRD OF

00:47:04.955 --> 00:47:06.490
ALL MEDICARE AND MEDICAID

00:47:06.557 --> 00:47:08.559
SERVICES ARE DELIVERED BY

00:47:08.625 --> 00:47:10.394
NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS WE DON'T

00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:12.029
DELIVER SERVICES AROUND THE

00:47:12.095 --> 00:47:13.964
MARGINS WE ARE IN FACT AT THE

00:47:14.031 --> 00:47:15.632
CORE OF THIS DELIVERY.

00:47:15.699 --> 00:47:17.067
AND IN TURN NONPROFIT STATE

00:47:17.134 --> 00:47:18.268
GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE THE FUNDS

00:47:18.335 --> 00:47:19.670
THAT MAKE THOSE SERVICES

00:47:19.736 --> 00:47:26.109
POSSIBLE IF YOU LOOK AT THE

00:47:26.176 --> 00:47:27.277
NONPROFIT SECTOR AS A WHOLE OF

00:47:27.344 --> 00:47:28.011
30% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE COMES

00:47:28.078 --> 00:47:29.246

GOVERNMENT PUT TOGETHER.

00:47:29.846 --> 00:47:30.347
SO THIS GOVERNMENT NONPROFIT

00:47:30.414 --> 00:47:31.882
PARTNERSHIP ISN'T JUST KIND OF A

00:47:31.949 --> 00:47:33.684

SO WHAT ARE THE LEVELS OF

00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:41.925
GOVERNMENT THAT FUND NON PROFITS

00:47:41.992 --> 00:47:43.594

00:47:58.809 --> 00:48:00.611
CALIFORNIA ALSO USES THE STATE'S

00:49:31.668 --> 00:49:33.437
HOSPITALS AND UNIVERSITIES FOR

00:49:33.503 --> 00:49:35.405
THE FROM THE EQUATION IN THE

00:49:35.472 --> 00:49:37.407
INLAND EMPIRE WHICH IS ASSEMBLY

00:49:37.474 --> 00:49:38.842
MEMBER RACIST DISTRICT TO US ON

00:49:38.909 --> 00:49:39.976
THIS COMMITTEE.

00:49:40.043 --> 00:49:41.912
HAS 11% OF CALIFORNIA'S

00:49:41.978 --> 00:49:47.784
POPULATION BUT ONLY 6% OF

00:49:47.851 --> 00:49:50.487
GOVERNMENT FUNDING.

00:49:50.554 --> 00:49:51.555
AND WHAT KINDS OF SERVICES TO

00:49:51.621 --> 00:49:54.458
THESE NON PROFITS FUND ART SORRY

00:49:54.524 --> 00:49:55.058
DO THESE FUNDS FUND -- WELL

00:49:55.125 --> 00:49:56.893
ABOUT 80% OF GOVERNMENT REVENUES

00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.762
GOES TO HUMAN SERVICES AND

00:49:58.829 --> 00:50:01.231
HEALTH IN ONE KIND OR ANOTHER --

00:50:01.298 --> 00:50:02.666
BUT IT GOES TO ALL KINDS OF

00:50:02.733 --> 00:50:05.268
OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL.

00:50:05.335 --> 00:50:06.803
SO WHY DOES IT MAKE SENSE FOR

00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:08.271
GOVERNMENT AND HEALTH AND HUMAN

00:50:08.338 --> 00:50:10.807
SERVICES TO FUND NON PROFITS TO

00:50:10.874 --> 00:50:12.743
DO SERVICES RATHER THAN THAN

00:50:12.809 --> 00:50:13.944
DELIVERING THEM DIRECTLY

00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:15.345
THEMSELVES BUT HERE JUST A FEW

00:50:15.412 --> 00:50:16.680
REASONS FIRSTOF ALL.

00:50:16.747 --> 00:50:18.482
IN THE AREA OF CONTAGIOUS

00:50:18.548 --> 00:50:20.517
DISEASES MANY PEOPLE WHO NEED

00:50:20.584 --> 00:50:21.752
TESTING AND TREATMENT FOR

00:50:21.818 --> 00:50:24.121
CONTAGIOUS DISEASES SUCH AS TB

00:50:24.187 --> 00:50:25.689
AIDS AND HEPATITIS.

00:50:25.756 --> 00:50:27.557
CAN BE REACHED BETTER BY THE NON

00:50:27.624 --> 00:50:29.292
PROFITS IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES.

00:50:29.359 --> 00:50:30.360
THEY DON'T THESE NONPROFITS

00:50:30.427 --> 00:50:31.862
DON'T HAVE THE INTIMIDATING

00:50:31.928 --> 00:50:33.196
STAMP OF GOVERNMENT THERE

00:50:33.263 --> 00:50:35.198
CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY IN

00:50:35.265 --> 00:50:36.266
TUNE WITH THE WITH THAT

00:50:36.333 --> 00:50:36.967
COMMUNITIES.

00:50:37.033 --> 00:50:38.635
AND THEIR PERCEIVED IS TRULY

00:50:38.702 --> 00:50:42.072
FRIENDLY AND AND COMMUNITY BASED.

00:50:42.139 --> 00:50:43.407
SECONDLY NONPROFITS ARE

00:50:43.473 --> 00:50:44.875
INNOVATIVE AND SERVICES NOT JUST

00:50:44.941 --> 00:50:50.347
DELIVERS OF SERVICE JUST AS ONE

00:50:50.414 --> 00:50:50.580
EXAMPLE.

00:50:50.647 --> 00:50:51.948
NOW THAT. TWENTY YEARS AGO OR

00:50:52.015 --> 00:50:52.516
THIRTY YEARS AGO IT WASN'T

00:50:52.582 --> 00:50:53.049
THOUGHT THAT PEOPLE WITH

00:50:53.116 --> 00:50:53.884
DISABILITIES COULD ATTEND

00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:55.685
MAINSTREAM SCHOOLS COULD HAVE

00:50:55.752 --> 00:50:57.354
MAINSTREAM JOBS ARE COULD VISIT

00:50:57.421 --> 00:50:58.688
MAINSTREAM PARKS.

00:50:58.755 --> 00:50:59.990
NOW WE KNOW THAT ALL THOSE

00:51:00.056 --> 00:51:01.958
THINGS HAPPEN IN LARGE PART

00:51:02.025 --> 00:51:04.227
BECAUSE NONPROFITS EXPERIMENTED

00:51:04.294 --> 00:51:06.196
WITH AND ADVOCATED FOR THE

00:51:06.263 --> 00:51:08.398
IMPORTANCE OF SERVICES AND FOR A

00:51:08.465 --> 00:51:10.000
DIFFERENT WAY OF THINKING ABOUT

00:51:10.066 --> 00:51:11.501
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES.

00:51:11.568 --> 00:51:13.737
THIRD NONPROFITS CAN MOBILIZE

00:51:13.804 --> 00:51:15.238
VOLUNTEERS RAISE MONEY AND OUR

00:51:15.305 --> 00:51:16.606
NUMBER THAN GOVERNMENT.

00:51:16.673 --> 00:51:18.241
THESE ARE ASPECTS OF SOMETIMES

00:51:18.308 --> 00:51:19.810
MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO DO

00:51:19.876 --> 00:51:21.545
OUR WORK AND A MODESTLY LOWER

00:51:21.611 --> 00:51:22.813
COST.

00:51:22.879 --> 00:51:24.047
SO TO BRING THIS TO LIFE I WANT

00:51:24.114 --> 00:51:25.182
TO TELL YOU ABOUT JUST ONE

00:51:25.248 --> 00:51:28.452
NONPROFIT -- IN THE TWENTY FIVE

00:51:28.518 --> 00:51:28.952
THOUSAND NON PROFITS IN

00:51:29.019 --> 00:51:31.087
CALIFORNIA WOULD HAVE PAID STAFF.

00:51:31.154 --> 00:51:32.355
AND THAT IS TO HIT THE CENTER

00:51:32.422 --> 00:51:33.857
FOR HUMAN SERVICES WHICH IS

00:51:33.924 --> 00:51:36.092
LOCATED IN MODESTO A NONPROFIT

00:51:36.159 --> 00:51:37.761
WITH MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED STAFF

00:51:37.828 --> 00:51:39.763
PROVIDING AS RANGE OF SERVICES

00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:41.164
THROUGHOUT STANISLAUS COUNTY.

00:51:41.231 --> 00:51:43.066
AND THE NEXT TIME YOU DRIVE INTO

00:51:43.133 --> 00:51:44.534
MODESTO YOU'LL SEE THEIR BIG

00:51:44.601 --> 00:51:45.802
SIGN ON THEIR BUILDING BECAUSE

00:51:45.869 --> 00:51:47.304
THE ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE AS YOU

00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:49.806
DRIVE IN THEY SERVE MORE THAN.

00:51:49.873 --> 00:51:50.841
TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE INCLUDING

00:51:52.242 --> 00:51:53.410
YEAR.

00:51:53.477 --> 00:51:54.511
SO HOW DID THEY DO THIS WORK

00:51:54.578 --> 00:51:57.380
WELL FIRST THEY USE PROP SIXTY

00:51:57.447 --> 00:51:58.048

TRAFFICKING.

00:52:10.594 --> 00:52:12.095
THEY HAVE A CASE MANAGER

00:52:12.162 --> 00:52:13.830

THE BOARD OF STATE AND COMMUNITY

JUSTICE CRIME PREVENTION ACT

00:52:26.176 --> 00:52:27.177
KNOWS THAT THIS WERE COULD NOT

00:52:27.244 --> 00:52:28.812
BE DONE IF THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO

00:52:28.879 --> 00:52:30.046
FIND THE CENTER FOR HUMAN

THEY CAN'T STATE OF CALIFORNIA

SUPPORTS REFUGEES THROUGH CAL

00:52:51.468 --> 00:52:52.002

00:52:52.068 --> 00:52:53.303
THROUGH SORRY THROUGH CAL NEW

00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:54.304
FUNDING -- THE MODESTO CENTER

00:52:54.371 --> 00:52:55.739
FOR HUMAN SERVICES ALSO RECEIVES

00:52:55.805 --> 00:52:57.274
FUNDING FROM THE OFFICE OF CHILD

00:52:57.340 --> 00:52:59.509
ABUSE PREVENTION TO HELP.

00:52:59.576 --> 00:53:01.011

WHO HAVE SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES

00:53:04.581 --> 00:53:05.882
AND I'M SURE I LEFT OUT

00:53:05.949 --> 00:53:07.484
SOMETHING THEY DO.

00:53:07.551 --> 00:53:08.985
BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT ALL OF

00:53:09.052 --> 00:53:11.121
THESE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES RELY

00:53:11.187 --> 00:53:12.455
ON THE CENTER TO PROVIDE

00:53:12.522 --> 00:53:13.657
SERVICES.

00:53:13.723 --> 00:53:15.759
AND IN TURN THE CENTERS CLOSELY

00:53:15.825 --> 00:53:17.827
CONNECTED WITH THE WITH THE

00:53:17.894 --> 00:53:19.696
GOALS AND THE MECHANISMS AND THE

00:53:19.763 --> 00:53:21.898
STRATEGIES THEIR GOVERNMENT

00:53:21.965 --> 00:53:24.134
PARTNERS.

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:25.302
AS PART OF OUR SOON TO BE RESET

00:53:25.368 --> 00:53:26.303
RESET RELEASED RESEARCH WE ALSO

00:53:26.369 --> 00:53:28.305
CONDUCTED A SURVEY OF MORE THAN

00:53:28.371 --> 00:53:29.673
TWELVE HUNDRED NONPROFIT LEADERS.

00:53:29.739 --> 00:53:31.241
AND THEY GAVE US SOME IDEAS ON

00:53:31.308 --> 00:53:33.076
WHAT WOULD HELP STRENGTHEN THEIR

00:53:33.143 --> 00:53:34.544
PARTNERSHIP WITH GOVERNMENT.

00:53:34.611 --> 00:53:37.480
PROBLEM NUMBER 160% OF NON

PROFITS TO RECEIVE FUNDING NOTE

00:53:39.215 --> 00:53:40.383
THAT THEY DO NOT RECEIVE A

00:53:40.450 --> 00:53:42.285
SUFFICIENT PAYMENTS TO COVER THE

00:53:42.352 --> 00:53:44.154
FULL COST OF THE WORK THAT IS

00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:45.789
BEING CONTRACTED.

00:53:45.855 --> 00:53:47.390
FOR AN URBAN INSTITUTE REPORT

00:53:47.457 --> 00:53:49.025
FROM TWENTY FIFTEEN SAYS THAT

00:53:49.092 --> 00:53:50.126
TWO THIRDS OF CALIFORNIA

00:53:50.193 --> 00:53:51.895
NONPROFITS HAVE INDIRECT COSTS

00:53:51.962 --> 00:53:54.564
RATES OF LESS THAN 10% WHICH WAS

00:53:54.631 --> 00:53:55.999
REFLECTED ON OUR SURVEY IT WITH

00:53:56.066 --> 00:53:58.168
THAT SHOWED 50% THAT SHOWED

00:53:58.234 --> 00:54:00.303
FEDERAL COST RATES BE AN AVERAGE

00:54:00.370 --> 00:54:01.805
OF NINE POINT 8%.

00:54:01.871 --> 00:54:04.274
STATE RATES EIGHT POINT TWO AND

00:54:04.341 --> 00:54:06.776
COUNTY AND CITY RATES 8%.

00:54:06.843 --> 00:54:08.878
HOW 8% OVERHEAD MIGHT SOUND KIND

00:54:08.945 --> 00:54:10.547
OF HIGH BUT WHEN YOU REMEMBER

00:54:10.614 --> 00:54:12.849
THAT THE FOR PROFIT BUSINESSES

00:54:12.916 --> 00:54:14.651
AND SERVICES AGENCIES?

00:54:14.718 --> 00:54:17.654
USE AS A STANDARD 35% IN

00:54:17.721 --> 00:54:19.456
OVERHEAD HE BREAKS YOU REALIZE

00:54:19.522 --> 00:54:20.890
HOW LO THESE INDIRECT COSTS

00:54:20.957 --> 00:54:22.459
RATES ARE.

00:54:22.525 --> 00:54:23.793
IN THE FOR PROFIT WORLD LARGE

00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:25.528
RETAILERS KNOW THEY HAVE A STAKE

00:54:25.595 --> 00:54:27.497
IN HAVING STRONG SUPPLY CHAINS

00:54:27.564 --> 00:54:28.898
THAT MEANS THEY HAVE TO PAY

00:54:28.965 --> 00:54:30.300
THEIR SUPPLIERS FAIRLY SO THAT

00:54:30.367 --> 00:54:31.701
THEY ARE NOT PRESSURED TO CUT

00:54:31.768 --> 00:54:33.103
QUALITY OR UNDER PAY THEIR

00:54:33.169 --> 00:54:34.170
WORKERS.

00:54:34.237 --> 00:54:36.306
CALIFORNIA NON PROFITS ARE A KEY

00:54:36.373 --> 00:54:37.674
PART OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN TO

00:54:37.741 --> 00:54:39.476
CALIFORNIA'S GOVERNMENT AND

00:54:39.542 --> 00:54:40.744
CALIFORNIA'S GOVERNMENT HAS A

00:54:40.810 --> 00:54:42.646
HUGE STAKE IN MAINTAINING A

00:54:42.712 --> 00:54:44.581
STRONG ECOSYSTEM IN THE

00:54:44.648 --> 00:54:46.082
NONPROFIT COMMUNITY.

00:54:46.149 --> 00:54:47.584
SECOND PROBLEM NONPROFITS

00:54:47.651 --> 00:54:49.052
FREQUENTLY REPORT THAT PAYMENT

00:54:49.119 --> 00:54:51.354
RATES CAN GO UNCHANGED FOR MORE

00:54:51.421 --> 00:54:52.255
THAN TEN YEARS.

00:54:52.322 --> 00:54:53.256
IN AREAS SUCH AS THE

00:54:53.323 --> 00:54:54.891
REIMBURSEMENT COSTS FOR MEALS

00:54:54.958 --> 00:54:56.793
DELIVERED TO ISOLATED SENIORS

00:54:56.860 --> 00:54:58.561
ARE FOR TESTING AND PHYSICAL

00:54:58.628 --> 00:55:00.163
THERAPY FOR PEACE PEOPLE WITH

00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:01.498
DISABILITIES.

00:55:01.564 --> 00:55:02.799
AS THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS

00:55:02.866 --> 00:55:06.236
GOES UP THESE RATES -- SIMPLY

00:55:06.302 --> 00:55:08.705
MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GO ON

00:55:08.772 --> 00:55:10.707
NONPROFITS WORK HARD AT RAISING

00:55:10.774 --> 00:55:12.442
PRIVATE MONEY FROM FOUNDATIONS

00:55:12.509 --> 00:55:14.210
AND FROM INDIVIDUALS TO MAKE UP

00:55:14.277 --> 00:55:16.346
THE GAP. ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS

00:55:16.413 --> 00:55:18.448
OF THAT HOWEVER IS IT MAKES IT

00:55:18.515 --> 00:55:19.783
VERY HARD FOR THEM TO GROW.

00:55:19.849 --> 00:55:24.554
THEIR GOVERNMENT AGENCY COULD BE

00:55:24.621 --> 00:55:25.855
SAYING WE WANT A DOUBLE THE

00:55:25.922 --> 00:55:26.523
FUNDING WE GIVE YOU SO THAT YOU

00:55:26.589 --> 00:55:27.157
CAN DOUBLE THE SERVICES YOU'RE

00:55:27.223 --> 00:55:27.857
PROVIDING.

00:55:27.924 --> 00:55:28.491
BUT THE NONPROFIT IS SAYING BUT

00:55:28.558 --> 00:55:30.226
WE HAVE TO RAISE A HUNDRED

00:55:30.293 --> 00:55:30.827
THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TO DO

00:55:30.894 --> 00:55:33.196
THIS WORK TO CLOSE THAT GAP.

00:55:33.263 --> 00:55:35.532
I'M NOT SURE WE CAN RAISE TWO

00:55:35.598 --> 00:55:36.700
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR.

00:55:36.766 --> 00:55:38.535
SO IN EFFECT THE ISSUE OF UNDER

00:55:38.601 --> 00:55:41.037
PAYMENT AND LOW AND OTHER NO

00:55:41.104 --> 00:55:42.539
TURN OVER AND RATES.

00:55:42.605 --> 00:55:44.307
MEANS IT MAKES IT HARDER FOR ALL

00:55:44.374 --> 00:55:46.276
OF US TO GROW SERVICES ONE MASS

01:09:26.562 --> 01:09:27.730
YOU CAN HAVE THE SAME

01:09:27.796 --> 01:09:29.331
APPROPRIATION FROM THE STATE.

01:09:29.398 --> 01:09:30.666
HAVE EXTREMELY DIFFERENT

01:09:30.733 --> 01:09:32.301
OVERHEAD RATES FOR EXAMPLE IF IT

01:09:32.368 --> 01:09:34.737
CAME THROUGH LA COUNTY EFFORT

01:09:34.803 --> 01:09:36.305
CAME FROM YOLO COUNTY

01:09:36.372 --> 01:09:36.605
[inaudible]

01:09:36.672 --> 01:09:38.007
GOT IT [inaudible]

01:09:38.073 --> 01:09:41.443
SO ON JANET YOU MENTIONED THAT

01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:44.146
THE YOU HAVE SEEN IT REGIONAL

01:09:44.213 --> 01:09:47.416
DISPARITIES IN FUNDING -- ARE

01:09:47.483 --> 01:09:48.450
THERE STRATEGIES THAT

01:09:48.517 --> 01:09:52.221
LEGISLATIVE BODY CAN CONSIDER --

01:09:52.288 --> 01:09:53.989
TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE.

01:09:54.056 --> 01:09:55.324
WELL AS YOU KNOW A LOT OF

01:09:55.391 --> 01:09:56.892
GOVERNMENT MONEY IS DISTRIBUTED

01:09:56.959 --> 01:09:58.894
BASED ON POPULATION COUNTS OF

01:09:58.961 --> 01:09:59.795
ONE SORT OR ANOTHER SO THAT'S

01:09:59.862 --> 01:10:01.430
WHAT WE'RE KIND OF SURPRISED TO

01:10:01.497 --> 01:10:03.399
SEE HOW MUCH DISPARITY THERE IS

01:10:03.465 --> 01:10:04.967
IN GOVERNMENT FUNDING AND SO I

01:10:05.034 --> 01:10:07.303
THINK AGAIN RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO

01:10:07.369 --> 01:10:08.203
WAY OF KNOWING.

01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:11.307
WHAT THAT IS -- WE ARE ABLE ONLY

01:10:11.373 --> 01:10:13.075
TO TELL GOVERNMENT FUNDING IN

01:10:13.142 --> 01:10:14.843
TOTAL UP BY REGION WE AREN'T

01:10:14.910 --> 01:10:16.579
ABLE TO SEPARATE IT OUT RIGHT

01:10:16.645 --> 01:10:18.314
NOW BY FEDERAL STATE.

01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:20.616
I'M COUNTY OR CITY SO IT'S HARD

01:10:20.683 --> 01:10:22.017
TO KNOW RIGHT NOW WITH EXACTLY

01:10:22.084 --> 01:10:23.085
WHAT WOULD WORK BUT I DO THINK

01:10:23.152 --> 01:10:24.153
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE

01:10:24.219 --> 01:10:25.888
LEGISLATURE WOULD WANT TO PAY

01:10:25.955 --> 01:10:28.390
MORE ATTENTION -- TO JUST LIKE

01:10:28.457 --> 01:10:29.592
YOU PAY ATTENTION TO WERE JOBS

01:10:29.658 --> 01:10:35.531
MONEY IS GOING PAID ATTENTION TO

01:10:35.598 --> 01:10:46.208
IS GOING IS IMPORTANT AS WELL.

01:10:46.275 --> 01:10:49.211
I'M ONE OF THE OTHER PIECES THAT

01:10:49.278 --> 01:10:51.947
WAS MENTIONED IS THAT -- THERE

01:10:52.014 --> 01:10:52.781
IS A 10%.

01:10:52.848 --> 01:10:54.450
CAP.

01:10:54.516 --> 01:10:56.752
ON INDIRECT COSTS THAT COMES

01:10:56.819 --> 01:10:59.455
FROM SOME OF THESE GRANTS -- IS

01:10:59.521 --> 01:11:02.925
THAT IN SOME ACTUALLY HAVE 3% SO

01:11:02.992 --> 01:11:04.193
HAVE EVERY SO.

01:11:04.259 --> 01:11:06.962
IS THAT IN STATUE OR IS THAT

01:11:07.029 --> 01:11:08.497
BASED ON THE AGENCY IS THERE AN

01:11:08.564 --> 01:11:09.665
OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THE

01:11:09.732 --> 01:11:11.967
AGENCY IF THAT FEELS.

01:11:12.034 --> 01:11:13.836
LIKE.

01:11:13.902 --> 01:11:15.604
FOR SOME GRANTS IT NEEDS TO

01:11:15.671 --> 01:11:16.772
CHANGE.

01:11:16.839 --> 01:11:18.207
IN SOME CASES IT'S WRITTEN INTO

01:11:18.273 --> 01:11:19.642
THE LEGISLATION FOR EXAMPLE

01:11:19.708 --> 01:11:23.178
FEDERAL MONEY MAY HAVE CAPS --

01:11:23.245 --> 01:11:25.247
RARELY DID THE CAPS OCCUR IN

01:11:25.314 --> 01:11:26.915
STATE FUNDING -- AND DIFFERENT

01:11:26.982 --> 01:11:27.883
COUNTIES THE DIFFERENT

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:29.418
DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THE CAN'T

01:11:29.485 --> 01:11:30.853
SAME COUNTY WILL HAVE VERY

01:11:30.919 --> 01:11:32.788
DIFFERENT RULES SO ONE OF THE

01:11:32.855 --> 01:11:34.023
ISSUES FOR NON PROFITS IS THAT

01:11:34.089 --> 01:11:35.457
THE SAME NONPROFIT LIKE THE

01:11:35.524 --> 01:11:37.092
CENTER FUMAN SERVICES IN MODESTO

01:11:37.159 --> 01:11:38.394
THAT I MENTIONED.

01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:39.495
THEY MIGHT HAVE FIFTEEN

01:11:39.561 --> 01:11:40.763
DIFFERENT INDIRECT COSTS RATES

01:11:40.829 --> 01:11:42.264
BECAUSE THEY'RE WORKING WITH

01:11:42.331 --> 01:11:43.532
DIFFERENT AGENCIES.

01:11:43.599 --> 01:11:45.134
SO WE'RE DOING THE PILOT PROJECT

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:46.568
RIGHT NOW WITH THE AUDITOR

01:11:46.635 --> 01:11:48.404
CONTROLLER IN LA COUNTY WITH THE

01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:49.938
HOPES OF TRYING TO FIND A WAY SO

01:11:50.005 --> 01:11:51.373
THAT WHEN A NON PROFITS

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:53.008
CONTRACTING WITH THE COUNTY.

01:11:53.075 --> 01:11:55.144
IF THE IF THE FUNDING AGENCIES

01:11:55.210 --> 01:11:56.478
STATE OR FEDERAL HAS NOT

01:11:56.545 --> 01:11:57.813
SPECIFIED IN INDIRECT COSTS

01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:00.182
RIGHT TO ALLOW THEM TO HAVE ONE

01:12:00.249 --> 01:12:01.483
IN DIRECT COSTS RATE.

01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:02.918
SO WE'RE HOPING THAT THIS PILOT

01:12:02.985 --> 01:12:04.787
IN LOS ANGELES SO YOU DON'T HAVE

01:12:04.853 --> 01:12:06.155
THE SITUATION WHERE PEOPLE HAVE

01:12:06.221 --> 01:12:07.856
MULTIPLE INDIRECT COSTS RATES

01:12:07.923 --> 01:12:09.992
WHICH IS CRAZY MAKING FROM AN

01:12:10.059 --> 01:12:14.096
ADMINISTRATIVE POINT OF VIEW --

01:12:14.163 --> 01:12:14.897
I MEAN THIS MEANS THIS MEANS

01:12:14.963 --> 01:12:16.899
THINGS LIKE I'VE SEEN ONE FIND

01:12:16.965 --> 01:12:19.001
ONE MEALS ON WHEELS ORGANIZATION

01:12:19.068 --> 01:12:20.269
THAT WAS ABLE TO GET FUNDING

01:12:20.335 --> 01:12:22.871
FROM THE GOVERNMENT FOR THE FOOD

01:12:22.938 --> 01:12:23.972
BUT NOT FOR THE PEOPLE TO HELP

01:12:24.039 --> 01:12:25.974
COOK IT OR FOR THE TRAYS TO PUT

01:12:26.041 --> 01:12:27.209
THE FOOD IN.

01:12:27.276 --> 01:12:28.777
THIS IS KIND OF THE REEDY

01:12:28.844 --> 01:12:30.345
CRAZIES BUT LANCE TO WHICH THE

01:12:30.412 --> 01:12:32.047
INDIRECT COSTS PRO PROBLEM CAN

01:12:32.114 --> 01:12:33.615
SOMETIMES GO.

01:12:33.682 --> 01:12:34.683
TO SO WE'RE HOPING THAT IF THE

01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:36.285
PILOT IN LA GOES WELL THAT WE

01:12:36.351 --> 01:12:37.586
MIGHT THINK ABOUT DOING IT IN

01:12:37.653 --> 01:12:39.488
OTHER COUNTIES AT THE STATE

01:12:39.555 --> 01:12:40.723
MIGHT CONSIDER SOMETHING LIKE

01:12:40.789 --> 01:12:43.058
THIS TO SOME. ONE AGENCY IN THE

01:12:43.125 --> 01:12:44.693
IF YOU HAVE ONE CONTRACT BUT SAY

01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:46.628
WITH HUMAN SERVICES AND YOU HAVE

01:12:46.695 --> 01:12:47.996
AN INDIRECT COST RATE WITH THEM

01:12:48.063 --> 01:12:49.965
YOU COULD USE THAT SAME RATE FOR

01:12:50.032 --> 01:12:52.634
YOUR CONTRACT WITH MEDIC WITH OB

01:12:52.701 --> 01:12:53.502
FISH AND WILDLIFE WITH

01:12:53.569 --> 01:12:55.471
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION EXETER

01:12:55.537 --> 01:12:57.206
ABOUT WOULD BE OUR GOAL.

01:12:57.272 --> 01:12:58.507
TENSION AND AND TELL ME A LITTLE

01:12:58.574 --> 01:12:59.441
BIT MORE ABOUT THIS PET PROGRAM

01:12:59.508 --> 01:13:02.211
WHEN DO YOU EXPECT TO FIND TO

01:13:02.277 --> 01:13:07.883
FOR IT TO CONCLUDE IN WHEN YOU

01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:08.717
MIGHT HAVE SOME.

01:13:08.784 --> 01:13:09.985
FINDINGS OF SORTS RELATED TO

01:13:10.052 --> 01:13:10.586
THIS SORT OF THE PILOT PROGRAM

01:13:10.652 --> 01:13:14.189
AN ALLEY -- SO WAIT AT WHERE IS

01:13:14.256 --> 01:13:15.491
IT IN THE STAGE VERY HARD IT IS

01:13:15.557 --> 01:13:16.558
IT FINISH I MEAN IS A PILOT

01:13:16.625 --> 01:13:17.226
PROGRAM GOING TO BE DONE DO WE

01:13:17.292 --> 01:13:18.727
KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE.

01:13:18.794 --> 01:13:20.195
IN TERMS OF THE FINDINGS OF THE

01:13:20.262 --> 01:13:21.230
IT'S KIND OF MOVING IT IS LIKE

IT LIKE IT'S MOVING SOME

01:13:22.731 --> 01:13:24.500
SOMETIMES IT'S LIKE AN AVALANCHE

01:13:24.566 --> 01:13:26.268
AND MOVES INCREDIBLY FAST AND

01:13:26.335 --> 01:13:27.002
THEN LIKE.

01:13:27.069 --> 01:13:29.304

KNOW YOU KNOW TEN YEARS TIME SO

01:13:30.773 --> 01:13:32.841
WE'RE HOPING THAT THE THE PILOT

01:13:32.908 --> 01:13:34.977
WILL ACTUALLY LAUNCH THIS FALL

01:13:35.043 --> 01:13:35.878
THIS FALL AND THEN WE'LL HAVE

01:13:35.944 --> 01:13:38.781
RESULTS IN MAYBE SIX MONTHS TO A

TOUCH -- PARTICULARLY WITH THAT

01:13:51.093 --> 01:13:51.560
JUST THE WEBSITE OBVIOUSLY

01:13:51.627 --> 01:13:54.062
THAT'S A BIG DEAL -- BUT ALSO OF

01:13:54.129 --> 01:13:57.466
COURSE WITH UNDERSTANDING BETTER

01:13:57.533 --> 01:13:59.334
AND I THINK THE FOR FOR THIS

01:13:59.401 --> 01:14:01.637
BODY IT WE DO WANT TO BETTER

01:14:01.703 --> 01:14:03.238
UNDERSTAND WHAT SOME OF THE

01:14:03.305 --> 01:14:05.707
LEGISLATIVE FIXES COULD BE.

01:14:05.774 --> 01:14:06.508
IF.

01:14:06.575 --> 01:14:08.744
IF WE HAVE THE NONPROFIT SERVING

01:14:08.811 --> 01:14:10.679
AS THE FOURTH LARGEST INDUSTRY --

01:14:10.746 --> 01:14:12.247
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA YOU

01:14:12.314 --> 01:14:14.249
KNOW WHAT ARE THE WAYS THAT YOU

01:14:14.316 --> 01:14:15.951
COULD WORK SMOOTHER I'M ON ALL

01:14:16.018 --> 01:14:17.452
FRONTS I A THINK IT'S NOT

01:14:17.519 --> 01:14:18.754
INTENDED.

01:14:18.821 --> 01:14:22.591
TO NECESSARILY JUST AT TAKE A

01:14:22.658 --> 01:14:23.759
POSITION OF ONLY HELPING THE

01:14:23.826 --> 01:14:25.627
NONPROFIT BUT ALSO THE STATE I

01:14:25.694 --> 01:14:27.462
MEAN WITH THIS MUCH FUNDING

01:14:27.529 --> 01:14:29.464
GOING TO NON PROFITS ARE THERE

01:14:29.531 --> 01:14:31.200
ELEMENTS THAT THIS LEGISLATIVE

01:14:31.266 --> 01:14:32.134
BODY.

01:14:32.201 --> 01:14:33.836
CONSIDER THAT WOULD FACILITATE

01:14:33.902 --> 01:14:35.304
SOME OF THIS I KNOW IN A LOT OF

01:14:35.370 --> 01:14:36.572
THE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD AS

01:14:36.638 --> 01:14:38.073
WELL [inaudible]

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:41.210
AND THE NONPROFIT WORLD AND EVEN

01:14:41.276 --> 01:14:42.978
PAYMENT SYSTEMS ARE CHANGING

01:14:43.045 --> 01:14:44.746
RIGHT THERE'S MORE TECHNOLOGY

01:14:44.813 --> 01:14:47.950
INVOLVED -- AND SO A A THINK AS

01:14:48.016 --> 01:14:49.418
WE THINK ABOUT THAT WE WOULD WE

01:14:49.484 --> 01:14:51.753
WOULD BE AN OPEN AS A BODY TO

01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:52.588
CONSIDER WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK

01:14:52.654 --> 01:14:52.921
LIKE.

01:14:52.988 --> 01:14:55.224
THERE IS NOT A DEDICATED

01:14:55.290 --> 01:14:57.326
NONPROFIT STANDING POLICY

01:14:57.392 --> 01:14:59.494
COMMITTEE RIGHT AND SO THIS IS

01:14:59.561 --> 01:15:01.263
OUR PLACE TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE

01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:03.699
TRANSLATE SOME OF WHAT WERE SEEN

01:15:03.765 --> 01:15:05.734
IN OUR FOURTH LARGEST INDUSTRY

01:15:05.801 --> 01:15:07.302
THAT SERVES MILLIONS.

01:15:07.369 --> 01:15:09.037
OF CALIFORNIANS THAT ALSO

01:15:09.104 --> 01:15:11.874
EMPLOYEES MANY CALIFORNIANS HOW

01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:13.809
WE COULD FACILITATE SOME OF THAT

01:15:13.876 --> 01:15:15.944
ELEMENT THAT COULD BE HELPFUL TO

01:15:16.011 --> 01:15:19.214
SEEN NONPROFITS BE MORE HEALTHY

01:15:19.281 --> 01:15:22.251

R. D. P. OVERALL THE REASON THIS --

01:27:22.503 --> 01:27:24.939
THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT IT FOR

01:27:25.006 --> 01:27:27.241
ME IS SO IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE

01:27:27.308 --> 01:27:30.144
THERE IS A A FIXATION AND I I

01:27:30.211 --> 01:27:31.279
USE THAT WORD.

01:27:31.346 --> 01:27:33.781

EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES.

01:27:35.049 --> 01:27:36.284
THE CHALLENGE WITH EVIDENCE

01:27:36.351 --> 01:27:37.418
BASED PRACTICES IS THAT THEY

01:27:37.485 --> 01:27:39.921
TEND TO BE A VERY EXPENSIVE

01:27:39.988 --> 01:27:42.290
SERVE FEW PEOPLE AND REALLY HAVE

01:27:42.357 --> 01:27:44.225

DELIVERED BY CERTAIN TYPES OF

01:27:47.028 --> 01:27:49.197
ORGANIZATIONS CAN I ASK YOU JUST

01:27:49.263 --> 01:27:50.431
A CLARIFYING QUESTION.

01:27:50.498 --> 01:27:51.332
WHEN YOU SAY THAT THERE'S A

01:27:51.399 --> 01:27:53.434
FIXATIONON EVIDENCE BASED

01:27:53.501 --> 01:27:54.235
PRACTICES?

01:27:54.302 --> 01:27:55.737
FROM YOUR LAND IS THAT A

01:27:55.803 --> 01:27:58.506
FIXATION THAT EASE PROMPTED BY

01:27:58.573 --> 01:28:03.611
THE LEGISLATURE BY PRACTITIONERS

01:28:03.678 --> 01:28:05.179
BY THE GENERAL PUBLIC -- IT'S

01:28:05.246 --> 01:28:06.214
LARGELY PROMULGATED BY FUNDERS

01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:08.549
AND RESPONDING TO LEGITIMATE

01:28:08.616 --> 01:28:10.018
CRITICISM THAT.

01:28:10.084 --> 01:28:12.020
WE DON'T KNOW WE DON'T DO A VERY

01:28:12.086 --> 01:28:13.354
GOOD JOB WE THAT GENERAL

01:28:13.421 --> 01:28:15.390
COMMUNITY OF THOSE OF US WHO GOT

01:28:15.456 --> 01:28:17.191
FINDING -- YOU KNOW DAY

01:28:17.258 --> 01:28:18.793
DEMONSTRATING THE EFFECTIVENESS

01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:21.362
OF THE PROJECTS THAT WE DO DO --

01:28:21.429 --> 01:28:23.264
WHY WE CHOOSE THIS METHODOLOGY

01:28:23.331 --> 01:28:24.899
VERSUS I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE --

01:28:24.966 --> 01:28:26.300
DIABETES WE DO A LOT OF WORK ON

01:28:26.367 --> 01:28:29.070
DIABETES THERE ARE MULTIPLE WAYS

DIABETES.

01:28:34.275 --> 01:28:35.877
THERE ARE ONLY ONE OR TWO THAT

01:28:35.943 --> 01:28:39.013
HAVE BEEN RIGOROUSLY TESTED --

01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:40.615
IT PARTICULARLY THIS IS IT THIS

01:28:40.682 --> 01:28:42.050
WHOLE IDEA OF EVIDENCE BASEMENTS

01:28:42.116 --> 01:28:43.384
ACTUAL CANCER MEDICINE WHERE

01:28:43.451 --> 01:28:44.819
YOU'RE DEALING WITH ONE PERSON

01:28:44.886 --> 01:28:47.355
ONE DOCTOR AND HOW ABOUT.

01:28:47.422 --> 01:28:48.022
PERSONS DISEASE SHOULD BE

01:28:48.089 --> 01:28:50.058
MANAGED -- WITH DIABETES THE ONE

01:28:50.124 --> 01:28:52.126
THERE ARE TWO PRACTICES THAT ARE

01:28:52.193 --> 01:28:53.061

STUDIED AND STUDIED AND THEY

01:28:55.663 --> 01:28:56.831
SEEM TO WORK.

01:28:56.898 --> 01:28:58.933
THEY ARE THE DIABETES PREVENTION

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.234
PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE WHICH HAS

01:29:00.301 --> 01:29:01.769
VERY PRETTY AND THEY'RE ALL THE

01:29:01.836 --> 01:29:02.737
EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE BECAUSE

01:29:02.804 --> 01:29:04.238
BY THEIR VERY NATURE VERY

01:29:04.305 --> 01:29:05.740
PRESCRIPTIVE.

01:29:05.807 --> 01:29:07.642
AND SO -- IT TELLS THE COMMUNITY

01:29:07.709 --> 01:29:09.110
WORKER EXACTLY HOW THEY WILL

01:29:09.177 --> 01:29:10.912
WORK WITH THIS PATIENT WITH

01:29:10.978 --> 01:29:13.081
DIABETES -- AS REFERRED BY THIS

01:29:13.147 --> 01:29:14.549
DOCTOR THE CHALLENGE WITH

01:29:14.615 --> 01:29:15.983
EXPANDING THAT TO COMMUNITIES

01:29:16.050 --> 01:29:17.719
AND PARTICULARLY TO NON TYPICAL

01:29:17.785 --> 01:29:19.053
COMMUNITIES.

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:20.488
IS THAT YOU REALLY DO HAVE TO

01:29:20.555 --> 01:29:22.957
ADOPT YOUR SERVICES TO THE

01:29:23.024 --> 01:29:24.158
PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE PROVIDING

01:29:24.225 --> 01:29:25.326
SERVICE.

01:29:25.393 --> 01:29:27.028
TO AND SO WHAT THIS PROJECT DOES

01:29:27.095 --> 01:29:29.297
IS IT SAYS WE RESPECT THE FACT

01:29:29.363 --> 01:29:30.398
THAT COMMUNITIES BELIEVE THAT

01:29:30.465 --> 01:29:32.734
THAT THE PRACTICE THAT'S ONGOING

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:35.436
AND WE CHOSE ON GOING PRACTICES

01:29:35.503 --> 01:29:37.038
THAT THE COMMUNITIES VALUED.

01:29:37.105 --> 01:29:41.609
HOUSE VALUE IF THE COMMUNITY

01:29:41.676 --> 01:29:42.376
BELIEVES THAT.

01:29:42.443 --> 01:29:43.644
THEN WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO HELP

01:29:43.711 --> 01:29:45.847
THOSE THOSE ORGANIZATIONS

01:29:45.913 --> 01:29:48.015
DEVELOP ENOUGH EVIDENCE BY THE

01:29:48.082 --> 01:29:49.650
WE WILL USE MORE RIGOROUS

01:29:49.717 --> 01:29:50.785
METHODOLOGY THAN THEY'VE BEEN

01:29:50.852 --> 01:29:52.386
ABLE TO USE TO EVALUATE THEIR

01:29:52.453 --> 01:29:54.689
PRACTICES. TO THAT'S ONE GOAL IS

01:29:54.756 --> 01:29:55.690
TO SAY WE WANT TO ADD TO THE

01:29:55.757 --> 01:29:58.292
EVIDENCE BASE FOR MENTAL HEALTH.

01:29:58.359 --> 01:30:00.628
AND IN PARTICULAR FOR PRACTICE

01:30:00.695 --> 01:30:01.729
THAT WILL REDUCE MENTAL HEALTH

01:30:01.796 --> 01:30:03.464
DISPARITIES THERE'S NO EVIDENCE

01:30:03.531 --> 01:30:05.233
BASE FOR THAT AT A POPULATION

01:30:05.299 --> 01:30:06.634
LEVEL AT ALL SO IT'S VERY

01:30:06.701 --> 01:30:08.336
DIFFICULT. TO SAY YOU WILL YOU

01:30:08.402 --> 01:30:09.504
ONLY USE EVIDENCE BASED

01:30:09.570 --> 01:30:10.938
PRACTICES SO WE WANT TO

01:30:11.005 --> 01:30:12.340
CONTRIBUTE TO THAT SCIENCE BY

01:30:12.406 --> 01:30:13.908
TAKING THESE PRACTICES THAT HAVE

01:30:13.975 --> 01:30:15.977
DEVELOPED IN COMMUNITIES.

01:30:16.043 --> 01:30:17.078
AND RIGOROUSLY EVALUATING THEM

01:30:17.145 --> 01:30:19.380
AT THE SAME TIME WE WANT TO

01:30:19.447 --> 01:30:21.082
BUILD THE CAPACITY OF NONPROFIT

01:30:21.149 --> 01:30:22.650
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE THE ONLY

01:30:22.717 --> 01:30:24.585
ONES PROVIDING THESE INCREDIBLY

01:30:24.652 --> 01:30:25.953
VALUABLE SERVICES.

01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:28.089
SO THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY ACCESS

01:30:28.156 --> 01:30:29.257
THE WORLD OF FUNDING.

01:30:29.323 --> 01:30:30.958
THAT LARGELY REQUIRES THAT YOU

01:30:31.025 --> 01:30:32.560
PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT WHAT

01:30:32.627 --> 01:30:34.262
YOU'RE DOING WORKS THERE CAUGHT

01:30:34.328 --> 01:30:35.630
IN A CATCH.

01:30:35.696 --> 01:30:36.164
TWENTY TWO THEY AND THEIR

01:30:36.230 --> 01:30:37.732
COMMUNITIES BELIEVE THAT WHAT

01:30:37.799 --> 01:30:39.167
THEY'RE DOING WORKS.

01:30:39.233 --> 01:30:40.802
THEY DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO

01:30:40.868 --> 01:30:42.503
EVALUATE IT TO THE LEVEL THAT IS

01:30:42.570 --> 01:30:43.838
REQUIRED FOR AN EVIDENCE BASED

01:30:43.905 --> 01:30:44.906
PRACTICE.

01:30:44.972 --> 01:30:46.641
AND NO WAY TO GET THERE FROM

01:30:46.707 --> 01:30:48.142
WHERE THEY ARE AND THEY OFTEN

01:30:48.209 --> 01:30:49.277
DON'T HAVE THAT CAPABILITY

01:30:49.343 --> 01:30:51.045
EITHER THAT THE ACTUAL TECHNICAL

01:30:51.112 --> 01:30:52.747
KNOW HOW OF HOW TO DO THAT KIND

01:30:52.814 --> 01:30:54.148
OF EVALUATION.

01:30:54.215 --> 01:30:55.383
SO WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH

01:30:55.449 --> 01:30:57.585
BOTH SUPPORTING THESE PRACTICES

01:30:57.652 --> 01:30:59.520
BECAUSE WE REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW

01:30:59.587 --> 01:31:01.589
TO REDUCE DISPARITIES IN MENTAL

01:31:01.656 --> 01:31:02.890
HEALTH.

01:31:02.957 --> 01:31:04.458
AND FOLKS IT IN COMMUNITIES

01:31:04.525 --> 01:31:06.060
BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE A WAY TO

01:31:06.127 --> 01:31:08.462
DO THAT THAT'S WORKING WE WANT

01:31:08.529 --> 01:31:10.064
TO SUPPORT THAT WE WANT TO BUILD

01:31:10.131 --> 01:31:11.265
THE EVIDENCE BASE.

01:31:11.332 --> 01:31:13.301
AND QUITE FRANKLY WE NEED THE

01:31:13.367 --> 01:31:14.902
NONPROFIT TO PROVIDE MENTAL

01:31:14.969 --> 01:31:16.404

AND WE WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO

01:31:18.206 --> 01:31:19.240
BE SUSTAINABLE.

01:31:19.307 --> 01:31:21.676
THIS IS ONE PROJECT THAT

01:31:21.742 --> 01:31:23.578

01:54:27.060 --> 01:54:28.261
AND EMPLOYMENT FUNDING.

01:54:28.328 --> 01:54:29.662
I THINK THE ONE THOUGHT THAT I

01:54:29.729 --> 01:54:33.199
WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE -- WITH WITH

01:54:33.266 --> 01:54:34.667
THE COMMITTEE IS THAT ARE

01:54:34.734 --> 01:54:36.302
ENGAGING WITH STATE AGENCIES AND

01:54:36.369 --> 01:54:38.004
NON PROFITS CAN BE I THINK AN

01:54:38.071 --> 01:54:39.405
INVALUABLE ASSET FOR STATE

01:54:39.472 --> 01:54:41.908
AGENCIES -- AND FOR NON PROFITS

AS WELL BECAUSE WE WE DIRECTLY

01:54:44.010 --> 01:54:45.745
SERVE AFTER IS IN NEED AND WE

01:54:45.812 --> 01:54:48.381
CAN PROVIDE A DIRECT VOICE -- TO

01:54:48.448 --> 01:54:49.916
THOSE AGENCIES AND FOR THOSE

01:54:49.983 --> 01:54:51.284
AGENCIES TO THE VETERANS FOR

01:54:51.351 --> 01:54:52.619
INTO VETERANS.

01:54:52.685 --> 01:54:54.220
WE CAN SERVICE A REAL TIME VOICE

01:54:54.287 --> 01:54:55.321
FOR DEVELOPING PROGRAMS AND

01:54:55.388 --> 01:54:57.824
ALLOCATING RESOURCES EFFECTIVELY.

01:54:57.890 --> 01:54:59.158
AND WHILE THE AGENCIES CAN

01:54:59.225 --> 01:55:00.426
PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED EXPERTISE

01:55:00.493 --> 01:55:01.961
AND IDENTIFYING RESOURCE AND

01:55:02.028 --> 01:55:03.263
PROGRAMS THAT CAN HELP VETERANS

01:55:03.329 --> 01:55:05.932
IN NEED -- IN NEED OF SUPPORT.

01:55:05.999 --> 01:55:08.034
WE'VE DONE I THINK A GOOD JOB

01:55:08.101 --> 01:55:08.668
OVER THE YEARS OF WORKING WITH

01:55:08.735 --> 01:55:09.902
CAL THAT.

01:55:09.969 --> 01:55:11.037
AND THE IMAGE AS ALWAYS SHE HAD

01:55:11.104 --> 01:55:12.305
WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON THESE IN

01:55:12.372 --> 01:55:14.307
VARIOUS ISSUES -- AGAIN

01:55:14.374 --> 01:55:16.209
NONPROFITS CAN PROVIDE A DIRECT

01:55:16.276 --> 01:55:18.611
LINK TO VETERANS IN NEED AND WE

01:55:18.678 --> 01:55:19.612
DEPEND ON THESE THAT ARE

01:55:19.679 --> 01:55:21.014
AGENCIES IN MANY CASES FOR

01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:22.448
PROGRAMS SUPPORT AND FUNDING.

01:55:22.515 --> 01:55:23.683
THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS

01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:25.051
OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU.

01:55:25.118 --> 01:55:26.786
THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR

01:55:26.853 --> 01:55:28.121
PRESENTATION ONE GENERAL

01:55:28.187 --> 01:55:29.956
QUESTION FOR EACH OF YOU TO

01:55:30.023 --> 01:55:30.890
THINK ABOUT IS IN YOUR

01:55:30.957 --> 01:55:32.692
PRESENTATION.

01:55:32.759 --> 01:55:34.794
YOU ALL DESCRIBED -- ELEMENTS

01:55:34.861 --> 01:55:36.829
THAT WORKED ON BETWEEN THE

01:55:36.896 --> 01:55:38.464
PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE FUNDING

01:55:38.531 --> 01:55:39.899
IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S MOSTLY

01:55:39.966 --> 01:55:42.201
GOVERNMENT IS THE FUNDING --

01:55:42.268 --> 01:55:43.970
FROM THE FUNDING THE NON PROFITS

01:55:44.037 --> 01:55:45.405
AND THE SERVICE PROVIDERS BUT

01:55:45.471 --> 01:55:49.108
YOU ALL ALLUDED. TO ADD MORE

01:55:49.175 --> 01:55:50.510
COULD BE DONE OR YOU'VE SAID

01:55:50.576 --> 01:55:56.082
THIS IN IN DIFFERENT WAYS FROM

01:55:56.149 --> 01:55:57.884
YOUR PERSPECTIVE -- WHAT MORE

01:55:57.950 --> 01:55:59.319
COULD BE DONE BY GOVERNMENT

01:55:59.385 --> 01:56:00.119
BESIDES INCREASE FUNDING BECAUSE

01:56:00.186 --> 01:56:01.721
THEY THINK THAT THAT?

01:56:01.788 --> 01:56:04.090
A DIFFERENT CHALLENGE BUT EIGHT

01:56:04.157 --> 01:56:05.391
IN TERMS OF MAKING THESE

01:56:05.458 --> 01:56:08.227
PARTNERSHIPS WORK SMOOTHER WHAT

01:56:08.294 --> 01:56:10.830
ELSE CAN GOVERNMENT DO.

01:56:10.897 --> 01:56:14.033
AND I IN SPECIFICALLY CALIFORNIA

01:56:14.100 --> 01:56:16.102
DO TO MAKE THIS.

01:56:16.169 --> 01:56:17.503
DIFFERENT I MEAN IN IN IN IN

01:56:17.570 --> 01:56:18.838
YOURCASE WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT

01:56:18.905 --> 01:56:21.074
MENTAL HEALTH IS IT REDEFINING

01:56:21.140 --> 01:56:22.642
THING IS IT RECONSIDERING THINGS.

01:56:22.709 --> 01:56:24.043
I THINK NOT JUST FOR MENTAL

01:56:24.110 --> 01:56:28.247
HEALTH BUT ACROSS THE BOARD --

01:56:28.314 --> 01:56:30.249
TO I'LL STICK WITH THE TOPIC

01:56:30.316 --> 01:56:31.551
EVERITT WHICH IS.

01:56:31.617 --> 01:56:33.086
OUR FUNDING -- DISCOVERED

01:56:33.152 --> 01:56:34.454
APARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH FUNDING

01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:37.256
OVER 80% OF THE FUNDING THAT WE

01:56:37.323 --> 01:56:39.859
HAVE THAT TOO EFFECT PROGRAMS IS

01:56:39.926 --> 01:56:40.960
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT

01:56:41.027 --> 01:56:43.463
COMES WITH INCREDIBLY.

01:56:43.529 --> 01:56:45.131
STRICT TIME LIMITS EVERYTHING'S

01:56:45.198 --> 01:56:46.499
IN SILOS.

01:56:46.566 --> 01:56:49.302
AND PEOPLE AND THE SERVICES THAT

01:56:49.369 --> 01:56:50.636
PEOPLE NEED ARE NOT SILENCE.

01:56:50.703 --> 01:56:51.838
AND SAID THERE'S A THERE'S A

01:56:51.904 --> 01:56:53.740
REAL TENSION THERE AND THAT IS

01:56:53.806 --> 01:56:56.109
ESPECIALLY AN ISSUE WHEN YOU'RE

01:56:56.175 --> 01:56:57.744
NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS

01:56:57.810 --> 01:56:59.212
ESPECIALLY SMALL NONPROFIT I WAS

01:56:59.278 --> 01:57:00.546
BEEN ON SEVERAL BOARDS.

01:57:00.613 --> 01:57:02.181
I USED TO BE I WORKED AT THE

01:57:02.248 --> 01:57:04.250
LOCAL LEVEL FOR TEN YEARS WELL

01:57:04.317 --> 01:57:06.552
EIGHTEEN YEARS -- THEY THEIR

01:57:06.619 --> 01:57:08.454
SERVICES ARE DESIGNED TO SERVE

01:57:08.521 --> 01:57:10.423
THE HUMANS NOT A PARTICULAR

01:57:10.490 --> 01:57:11.824
DISEASE PROCESS OR WHETHER IT'S

01:57:11.891 --> 01:57:13.393
MENTAL HEALTH OR WHATEVER AND SO

01:57:13.459 --> 01:57:14.894
THEY HAVE GREATER FLEXIBILITY.

01:57:14.961 --> 01:57:16.629
THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE IS

01:57:16.696 --> 01:57:18.331
THAT BECAUSE MOST OF THE MONEY

01:57:18.398 --> 01:57:19.999
THAT WE SEND DOWN IS FEDERAL

01:57:20.066 --> 01:57:21.801
WE'RE LIMITED TO WHAT CONGRESS

01:57:21.868 --> 01:57:24.170
HAS SAID THIS PARTICULAR FUNDING

01:57:24.237 --> 01:57:26.205
STREAM CAN BE USED -- FOR WITH

01:57:26.272 --> 01:57:30.510
STATE MONEY THE ABILITY -- TO TO

01:57:30.576 --> 01:57:32.145
HAVE THE LEGISLATURE NOT IT'S

01:57:32.211 --> 01:57:33.780
NOT THROUGH THE DOORS OPEN INTO

01:57:33.846 --> 01:57:35.448
WITH THIS MANY ANYTHING YOU WANT

01:57:35.515 --> 01:57:37.617
BUT TO ALLOW FOR FLOOD A LITTLE

01:57:37.683 --> 01:57:39.285
FLEXIBILITY IN THE ABSOLUTE

01:57:39.352 --> 01:57:41.053
EITHER THE TARGET POPULATION OR

01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:42.955
THE ACTIVITIES -- TO ALLOW FOR

01:57:43.022 --> 01:57:44.357
DISCRETION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

01:57:44.424 --> 01:57:46.159
BECAUSE EACH COMMUNITY IS

01:57:46.225 --> 01:57:47.427
DIFFERENT EACH OF THE

01:57:47.493 --> 01:57:48.895
POPULATIONS WE SERVE ARE

01:57:48.961 --> 01:57:49.729
DIFFERENT.

01:57:49.796 --> 01:57:52.965
AND SO AND ALSO IF YOU IF YOU

01:57:53.032 --> 01:57:55.001
ONLY EVER DO THE SAME THING YOU

01:57:55.067 --> 01:57:56.702
WILL NEVER INNOVATE ANYTHING AND

01:57:56.769 --> 01:57:57.837
SO THERE'S NOT.

01:57:57.904 --> 01:57:59.739
I THINK THE OTHER THING IS --

01:57:59.806 --> 01:58:01.808
THERE ARE AS WAS MENTIONED BY

01:58:01.874 --> 01:58:03.009
THE EARLIER PANEL THE

01:58:03.075 --> 01:58:08.448
RESTRICTION ON OVERHEAD.

01:58:08.514 --> 01:58:09.315
CAN BE REALLY PROBLEMATIC WE

01:58:09.382 --> 01:58:09.982
HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM BOTH WITH

01:58:10.049 --> 01:58:10.616
THE MONEY THAT COMES FROM THE

01:58:10.683 --> 01:58:11.951
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT ALSO FROM

01:58:12.018 --> 01:58:14.086
SOME OF THE STATE MANY FOR US TO

01:58:14.153 --> 01:58:15.488
AFFECT PROGRAMS WE KNOW JUST HOW

01:58:15.555 --> 01:58:17.123
HARD IT IS TO DO WHEN WE GET.

01:58:17.190 --> 01:58:18.558
ABOUT HALF OF WHAT IT ACTUALLY

01:58:18.624 --> 01:58:19.692
COSTS.

01:58:19.759 --> 01:58:21.627
IT'S THAT MUCH MORE DAMAGING AT

01:58:21.694 --> 01:58:23.696
THE LOCAL LEVEL SO THAT THE

01:58:23.763 --> 01:58:25.264
ABILITY TO ALLOW US TO SET

01:58:25.331 --> 01:58:27.366
REALISTIC IN THE CALIFORNIA

01:58:27.433 --> 01:58:28.601
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH.

01:58:28.668 --> 01:58:29.869
THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR MONEY

01:58:29.936 --> 01:58:32.305
GOES OUT TO LOCALS AND FOR EACH

01:58:32.371 --> 01:58:34.974
COUNTY -- WE HAVE BECAUSE WE

01:58:35.041 --> 01:58:35.942
HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT FUNDING

01:58:36.008 --> 01:58:37.176
STREAMS RETURN TWENTY ONE

01:58:37.243 --> 01:58:38.878
PROGRAM SO THAT WE HAVE MULTIPLE

01:58:38.945 --> 01:58:40.246
CONTRACTS WITH EVERY COUNTY.

01:58:40.313 --> 01:58:41.647
WE CAME UP WITH THE PROCESS

01:58:41.714 --> 01:58:43.115
ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO TO SET A

01:58:43.182 --> 01:58:46.419
STANDARD -- OVERHEAD RATE FOR

01:58:46.486 --> 01:58:47.820
EACH COUNTY THEY'RE NOT ALL THE

01:58:47.887 --> 01:58:49.222
SAME BECAUSE EACH COUNTIES

01:58:49.288 --> 01:58:50.289
DIFFERENT.

01:58:50.356 --> 01:58:51.757
BUT THAT WAY ALL OF OUR GRANTS

01:58:51.824 --> 01:58:52.758
THEY KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH

01:58:52.825 --> 01:58:54.093
OVERHEAD THEY'LL GET AND IT'S

01:58:54.160 --> 01:58:55.361
DESIGNED TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY

01:58:55.428 --> 01:58:57.463
MEET THEIR NEEDS SOME KIND OF

01:58:57.530 --> 01:59:00.800
SIMILAR PROCESS FOR AGENCIES.

01:59:00.867 --> 01:59:01.601
CAN HELP IT.

01:59:01.667 --> 01:59:03.302
NOT FOR EVERY AGENCY BECAUSE

01:59:03.369 --> 01:59:04.670
SOME OF THE AGAIN SOME OF THE

01:59:04.737 --> 01:59:05.505
FINDINGS RESTRICTED BY THE FEDS

01:59:05.571 --> 01:59:07.740
BUT TO WHEN WE CAN WITH STATE

01:59:07.807 --> 01:59:09.509
MONEY TO ALLOW US TO WORK MORE

01:59:09.575 --> 01:59:11.978
CLOSELY WITH THE FLEXIBILITY.

01:59:12.044 --> 01:59:13.479
THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND

01:59:13.546 --> 01:59:15.047
LOCAL NONPROFITS NEED TO

01:59:15.114 --> 01:59:16.382
ACTUALLY BE SUCCESSFUL I THINK

01:59:16.449 --> 01:59:18.985
THAT WOULD BE THE ONE THING THAT

01:59:19.051 --> 01:59:20.152
COULD REALLY HELP THANK YOU.

01:59:20.219 --> 01:59:21.954
AT THAT ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT I

01:59:22.021 --> 01:59:25.091
THINK IS AN I. I'LL SPEAK -- NOW

01:59:25.157 --> 01:59:27.426
I'M NOT NECESSARILY FROM -- A

01:59:27.493 --> 01:59:28.661
CANCER PERSPECTIVE BUT FROM A

01:59:28.728 --> 01:59:30.162
GENERAL NONPROFIT PERSPECTIVE

01:59:30.229 --> 01:59:31.230
WHAT I'VE SEEN IN WORKING WITH

01:59:31.297 --> 01:59:33.699
OTHER NON PROFITS PARTICULAR IN

01:59:33.766 --> 01:59:35.635
THE MENTAL HEALTH GRANT SIDE.

01:59:35.701 --> 01:59:36.602
AND THAT IS SAID -- NONPROFITS

01:59:36.669 --> 01:59:37.603
TEND NOT TO BE ALL THAT

01:59:37.670 --> 01:59:39.438
SOPHISTICATED I THINK THAT'S

01:59:39.505 --> 01:59:40.706
SOMETHING THAT WE RECOGNIZE

01:59:40.773 --> 01:59:42.341
FAIRLY EARLY ON AND I THINK

01:59:42.408 --> 01:59:43.976
GENERALLY SPEAKING CAPS AS AS

01:59:44.043 --> 01:59:45.578
DEVELOPED OVER THE YEARS WE'VE

01:59:45.645 --> 01:59:47.380
BEEN AROUND FOR AWHILE -- Và

01:59:47.446 --> 01:59:48.614
SOPHISTICATED APPROACH TO PUBLIC

01:59:48.681 --> 01:59:50.550
POLICY IN A AND AN UNDERSTANDING

01:59:50.616 --> 01:59:52.051
OF WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO -- TO

01:59:52.118 --> 01:59:53.452
OBTAIN GRANT MONEY MOST

01:59:53.519 --> 01:59:54.554
NONPROFITS.

01:59:54.620 --> 01:59:56.155
ARE THAT SOPHISTICATED AND AND

01:59:56.222 --> 01:59:58.090
THE GRANT PROCESS OFTEN TIMES

01:59:58.157 --> 01:59:59.425
THAT WE'VE SEEN CAN BE

01:59:59.492 --> 02:00:00.893
EXTRAORDINARILY COMPLICATED AN

02:00:00.960 --> 02:00:03.663
EXTRAORDINARILY EXPENSIVE TO GET

02:00:03.729 --> 02:00:06.332
ENGAGED IN -- AUNTS AND SO YOU

02:00:06.399 --> 02:00:07.133
HAD TO TYPICALLY IF YOU'RE IF

02:00:07.199 --> 02:00:08.000
YOU'RE APPLYING FOR GRAD SOME

02:00:08.067 --> 02:00:10.102
PLACE -- IF YOU FOR NONPROFITS

02:00:10.169 --> 02:00:12.271
WRITING THAT GRANT THEMSELVES

02:00:12.338 --> 02:00:12.872
IT'S PROBABLY COULD BE WRITTEN

02:00:12.939 --> 02:00:14.607
VERY WELL -- SO YOU'RE LOOKING

02:00:14.674 --> 02:00:16.075
AT HIGHER GRANT WRITERS SO THE

02:00:16.142 --> 02:00:17.577
RESOURCES THAT YOU HAVE TO

02:00:17.643 --> 02:00:18.978
EXPAND ACCESS THAT MONEY.

02:00:19.045 --> 02:00:20.279
CAN BE CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT AT

02:00:20.346 --> 02:00:23.015
TIMES -- FROM A STRICTLY FROM A

02:00:23.082 --> 02:00:26.252
CABS A PERSPECTIVE -- ALL AND

02:00:26.319 --> 02:00:27.987
AND AND AND THIS IS MORE FROM

02:00:28.054 --> 02:00:29.388
PUBLIC POLICY ILL MOST OF OUR

02:00:29.455 --> 02:00:31.290
MONEY COMES FROM FEDERAL GRANTS

02:00:31.357 --> 02:00:32.191
I MENTIONED EARLIER.

02:00:32.258 --> 02:00:35.094
AND IT'S IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO

02:00:35.161 --> 02:00:40.533
PROVIDE. TO TO COORDINATE --

02:00:40.600 --> 02:00:42.368
EIGHTY COHESIVE AND CONCISE

02:00:42.435 --> 02:00:43.402
MESSAGE BACK TO THE FEDERAL

02:00:43.469 --> 02:00:45.304
GOVERNMENT ON ON FUNDING ISSUES

02:00:45.371 --> 02:00:46.839
AND I KNOW OUR OF THE

02:00:46.906 --> 02:00:48.240
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CALIFORNIA

02:00:48.307 --> 02:00:49.542
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT

02:00:49.609 --> 02:00:51.978
ALWAYS THE BEST -- OFTENTIMES A

02:00:52.044 --> 02:00:53.379
VECTOR TO VETERANS ISSUES WERE

02:00:53.446 --> 02:00:55.281
FORTUNATE AND IN THE MESSAGES

02:00:55.348 --> 02:00:56.248
CAN BE.

02:00:56.315 --> 02:00:58.951
DELIVERED PRETTY EFFECTIVELY BUT

02:00:59.018 --> 02:01:00.686
WORKING WITH THE THE NONPROFIT

02:01:00.753 --> 02:01:02.321
SAID THAT ACTUALLY ARE ACTIVE

02:01:02.388 --> 02:01:04.490
BACK IN IN DC AND AND WE WORK OF

02:01:04.557 --> 02:01:07.159
THE SPEAKER'S OFFICE WITH --

02:01:07.226 --> 02:01:09.061
FREQUENTLY -- IN FACT GEORGE

02:01:09.128 --> 02:01:10.129
WHILE HE IS A GREAT RESOURCE FOR

02:01:10.196 --> 02:01:13.599
US -- TO TO TO HELP FILTERS

02:01:13.666 --> 02:01:14.700
POLICIES SO WHEN PEOPLE ARE

02:01:14.767 --> 02:01:16.569
GOING BACK TO DC WE EXCHANGE

02:01:16.636 --> 02:01:19.005
MESSAGES ON ON ON WHAT WHAT'S A

02:01:19.071 --> 02:01:21.007
PRIORITY -- BUT I THINK WE COULD

02:01:21.073 --> 02:01:22.908
DO A MUCH MUCH BETTER JOB OF

02:01:22.975 --> 02:01:24.844
THAT AS WELL -- IN IN JUST

02:01:24.910 --> 02:01:29.482
COORDINATING OUR OUR MESSAGES

02:01:29.548 --> 02:01:29.949
BACK TO DC [inaudible]

02:01:30.016 --> 02:01:34.620
THANK YOU -- CAN YOU RESTATE

02:01:34.687 --> 02:01:35.321
ACOSTA JUST QUICKLY SO JUST FROM

02:01:35.388 --> 02:01:36.222
YOUR PERSPECTIVE WHAT CAN

02:01:36.288 --> 02:01:38.991
GOVERNMENT DO TO FACILITATE.

02:01:39.058 --> 02:01:41.594
THE WORK THAT YOU DO BESIDES

02:01:41.661 --> 02:01:42.862
INCREASE SPENDING SURE.

02:01:42.928 --> 02:01:45.264
OKAY SO I HAVE TWO THINGS THAT I

02:01:45.331 --> 02:01:46.766
THINK OF SPEAKING ON FROM --

02:01:46.832 --> 02:01:48.701
NONPROFIT THAT -- PROVIDE

02:01:48.768 --> 02:01:50.436
SERVICES TO AND UNDERSERVED

02:01:50.503 --> 02:01:52.872
COMMUNITIES -- I THINK THERE'S

02:01:52.938 --> 02:01:55.107
TWO THINGS THAT COULD COULD HELP --

02:01:55.174 --> 02:01:57.743
ONE IS JUST AND HAD A REAL --

02:01:57.810 --> 02:01:59.945
NEEDS ASSESSMENT TO BE ABLE TO

02:02:00.012 --> 02:02:01.180
ASK THE COMMUNITY WHAT ARE YOU

02:02:01.247 --> 02:02:02.181
NEEDS WE KNOW THERE ARE MANY

02:02:02.248 --> 02:02:03.349
MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS WHEN THEY

02:02:03.416 --> 02:02:04.684
COME TO REFUGEES ARE UNDERSERVED

02:02:04.750 --> 02:02:06.652
COMMUNITIES -- BUT YOU KNOW

02:02:06.719 --> 02:02:08.487
THERE'S OTHER NEEDS THAT WOULD

02:02:08.554 --> 02:02:11.424
SUPPORT THE WELLNESS OVERALL.

02:02:11.490 --> 02:02:12.958
FOR A PARTICULAR UNDERSERVED

02:02:13.025 --> 02:02:15.261
COMMUNICATING DOING AN EXTENSIVE

02:02:15.327 --> 02:02:17.196
NEEDS ASSESSMENT -- FOR LACK OF

02:02:17.263 --> 02:02:18.764
BETTER WORD WOULD BE ONE I THINK

02:02:18.831 --> 02:02:20.966
THAT WOULD BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL --

02:02:21.033 --> 02:02:22.368
ANOTHER THING IS ADVOCACY

02:02:22.435 --> 02:02:25.171
ENABLING UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES

02:02:25.237 --> 02:02:26.539
TO BE ABLE TO KNOW WHAT IS

02:02:26.605 --> 02:02:28.240
ADVOCACY AND WHAT ARE THE

02:02:28.307 --> 02:02:31.744
BENEFITS MANY -- COMMUNITIES --

02:02:31.811 --> 02:02:35.414
OR EVEN NON PROFITS -- ARE NOT

02:02:35.481 --> 02:02:37.183
OUR SMALL NONPROFIT SPECIALLY --

02:02:37.249 --> 02:02:38.751
ARE NOT TRAINED OR DON'T HAVE

02:02:38.818 --> 02:02:39.985
ENOUGH EXPERIENCE AND ADVOCACY

02:02:40.052 --> 02:02:42.621
AND I THINK THAT'S A HUGE PART

02:02:42.688 --> 02:02:48.360
OF MAKING A GUY YOU KNOW.

02:02:48.427 --> 02:02:49.295
HELPING THE COMMUNITY OVERALL.

02:02:49.361 --> 02:02:50.062
AND I APPRECIATE THAT COMMENT

02:02:50.129 --> 02:02:50.696
BECAUSE IT ECHOES I THINK WHAT

02:02:50.763 --> 02:02:51.263
THE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS

02:02:51.330 --> 02:02:53.666
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IN THIS.

02:02:53.733 --> 02:02:55.167
THE SELECT COMMITTEE HAS TOUCHED

02:02:55.234 --> 02:02:57.336
ON THE FACT THAT [inaudible]

02:02:57.403 --> 02:03:00.706
MOST -- NON PROFITS AREN'T

02:03:00.773 --> 02:03:02.708
COMFORTABLE OR CLEAR WHERE

02:03:02.775 --> 02:03:04.677
ADVOCACY IS ALLOWED IN IS NOT

02:03:04.744 --> 02:03:08.180
ALLOWED AND SO -- GREATER

02:03:08.247 --> 02:03:10.149
AWARENESS CONTINUES TO BE AN

02:03:10.216 --> 02:03:11.383
ISSUE FOR THE TWO YEARS I KNOW

02:03:11.450 --> 02:03:12.818
WE'VE TRIED TO TACKLE THAT SO I

02:03:12.885 --> 02:03:14.320
APPRECIATE.

02:03:14.386 --> 02:03:16.455
HEARING THAT FROM YOU.

02:03:16.522 --> 02:03:17.823
SO THE THE CALIFORNIA TERMS

02:03:17.890 --> 02:03:19.558
ASSISTANCE PROGRAM IS STILL THEM

02:03:19.625 --> 02:03:21.594
IN ITS INFANT STAGES WERE ABOUT

02:03:21.660 --> 02:03:22.628
TWO YEARS SO WE'RE CONSTANTLY

02:03:22.695 --> 02:03:25.865
EVOLVING -- AND I THINK -- ARE

02:03:25.931 --> 02:03:27.733
THE MAIN KEY FOR US IS TO TO BE

02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:28.768
ABLE TO SAYS VETERANS AND THEIR

02:03:28.834 --> 02:03:30.469
FAMILIES SERVICE MEMBERS THROUGH

02:03:30.536 --> 02:03:32.037
THEIR ENTIRE LIFE SO THEIR THEIR

02:03:32.104 --> 02:03:32.805
NEEDS ARE GOING TO CHANGE I

02:03:32.872 --> 02:03:34.540
THINK WITH COLLABORATION WITH

02:03:34.607 --> 02:03:36.041
QUALITY NON PROFITS THAT WERE.

02:03:36.108 --> 02:03:38.110
WERE WERE CUT WERE INVOLVED WITH

02:03:38.177 --> 02:03:42.314
NOW -- WERE ABLE TO MISTER HOGAN

02:03:42.381 --> 02:03:42.948
MENTION A LOT OF A LOT OF STUFF

02:03:43.015 --> 02:03:43.916
IS.

02:03:43.983 --> 02:03:44.850
SOLELY BAKER BASED ON EMPLOYMENT

02:03:44.917 --> 02:03:46.719
EDUCATION BUT TO ADD SOME

02:03:46.786 --> 02:03:48.454
SUPPORT SERVICES IS WHAT WE'RE

02:03:48.521 --> 02:03:50.923
DOING NOW -- WITH US BETS TOWARD

02:03:50.990 --> 02:03:51.924
THE PLOW SHARES WE'RE GONNA

02:03:51.991 --> 02:03:54.093
CONTINUE TO DO THAT AND INVOLVED

02:03:54.160 --> 02:03:54.994
WE HAVE.

02:03:55.060 --> 02:03:56.228
AS I MENTIONED THE NINETEEN

02:03:56.295 --> 02:03:58.197
CAMPUSES IN LOS ANGELES THAT

02:03:58.264 --> 02:03:58.764
THERE'S GOING TO BE SUPPORT

02:03:58.831 --> 02:04:00.199
SERVICES THERE HOPEFULLY THAT'S

02:04:00.266 --> 02:04:02.001
ABLE TO EXPAND OVER THE THE NEXT

02:04:02.067 --> 02:04:03.669
FEW YEARS THAT WOULD BE IDEAL TO

02:04:03.736 --> 02:04:04.436
HAVE SOME.

02:04:04.503 --> 02:04:06.071
SOMEONE ON SOME CAMPUS WHERE

02:04:06.138 --> 02:04:07.106
VETERANS SERVICE MEMBER THEIR

02:04:07.173 --> 02:04:09.141
FAMILY CAN SPEAK TO ABOUT ANY

02:04:09.208 --> 02:04:10.676
ANY ISSUES THAT.

02:04:10.743 --> 02:04:12.111
MAYBE THE SCHOOL DOESN'T HAVE SO

02:04:12.178 --> 02:04:13.445
WE WANT TO PROVIDE THAT AT A

02:04:13.512 --> 02:04:15.214
COMMUNITY COLLEGES -- BASICALLY

02:04:15.281 --> 02:04:16.482
ANYWHERE WHERE THERE'S A A LARGE

02:04:16.549 --> 02:04:19.018
GROUP OF VETERANS THAT NEED

02:04:19.084 --> 02:04:21.420
ASSISTANCE IN THAT.

02:04:21.487 --> 02:04:23.823
AS YOU ALL THINK ABOUT THE WORK

02:04:23.889 --> 02:04:25.024
THAT YOU'RE DOING AND THE

02:04:25.090 --> 02:04:26.525
PARTNERSHIPS YOU HAVE WITH OTHER

02:04:26.592 --> 02:04:27.760
NON PROFITS OTHER COMMUNITY

02:04:27.827 --> 02:04:29.228
AGENCIES WITH SCHOOL SITES WITH

02:04:29.295 --> 02:04:31.997
COMMUNITIES -- ALTOGETHER.

02:04:32.064 --> 02:04:34.166
ARE THERE ELEMENTS THAT YOU'VE

02:04:34.233 --> 02:04:36.368
IDENTIFIED THAT COULD BE HELPFUL

02:04:36.435 --> 02:04:38.170
PARTICULARLY FOR SMALLER

02:04:38.237 --> 02:04:39.872
NONPROFITS THERE'S THIS IDEA

02:04:39.939 --> 02:04:41.941
THAT IF YOU'RE LARGER NONPROFIT

02:04:42.007 --> 02:04:43.509
YOU MIGHT BE MORE SOPHISTICATED

02:04:43.576 --> 02:04:45.978
YOU HAVE GREATER CAPACITY -- BUT

02:04:46.045 --> 02:04:48.948
IN CALIFORNIA SO MANY OF THE

02:04:49.014 --> 02:04:50.916
NONPROFIT SAD THAT MAKE UP THIS

02:04:50.983 --> 02:04:52.651
FOURTH LARGEST INDUSTRY ARE

02:04:52.718 --> 02:04:54.220
STILL CONSIDERED YOU KNOW

02:04:54.286 --> 02:04:56.155
SMALLER MEDIUM SIZE FROM YOUR

02:04:56.222 --> 02:04:58.490
PERSPECTIVE ARE THERE ELEMENTS

02:04:58.557 --> 02:04:58.691
THAT.

02:04:58.757 --> 02:05:00.793
CAN ENHANCE A SUCCESSFUL

02:05:00.860 --> 02:05:03.362
PARTNERSHIP -- IS IT ADVANCE

02:05:03.429 --> 02:05:04.830
PAYMENTS IT SOUNDS LIKE

02:05:04.897 --> 02:05:06.298
FLEXIBILITY FEEL LIKE THIS IS A

02:05:06.365 --> 02:05:07.867
THEME THAT I'M HEARING --

02:05:07.933 --> 02:05:10.135
FLEXIBILITY IT IS PART OF IT BUT

02:05:10.202 --> 02:05:12.137
IS IT MULTI YEAR FUNDING VERSUS

02:05:12.204 --> 02:05:13.739
SINGLE YOUR FUNDING -- PROVIDING

02:05:13.806 --> 02:05:15.407
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WHAT WHAT

02:05:15.474 --> 02:05:17.409
KINDS OF THINGS DO YOU THINK CAN

02:05:17.476 --> 02:05:21.647
HELP -- SO SMALLER NONPROFITS

02:05:21.714 --> 02:05:22.581
GET TO THIS.

02:05:22.648 --> 02:05:24.016
LEVEL THAT'S ONE OF THE PIECES

02:05:24.083 --> 02:05:25.651
OF THE THE CALIFORNIA REDUCING

02:05:25.718 --> 02:05:27.820
DISPARITIES PROJECT THAT WE ARE

02:05:27.887 --> 02:05:29.788
MOST PROUD OF IS THAT WE HAD

02:05:29.855 --> 02:05:31.557
THESE CAPACITY BUILDING GRANTS

02:05:31.624 --> 02:05:32.458
AND THEY WERE SPECIFIC THEY

02:05:32.524 --> 02:05:33.959
WEREN'T AROUND BUILDING YOUR

02:05:34.026 --> 02:05:35.527
MENTAL HEALTH CAPACITY.

02:05:35.594 --> 02:05:36.996
THERE ARE AROUND HOW DO YOU

02:05:37.062 --> 02:05:39.331
APPLY FOR A GRANT WHAT DOES YOUR

02:05:39.398 --> 02:05:41.400
ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE NEED TO

02:05:41.467 --> 02:05:42.801
LOOK LIKE SO THAT YOU KNOW HOW

02:05:42.868 --> 02:05:44.603
TO INVOICE THAT SO THAT YOU KNOW

02:05:44.670 --> 02:05:45.704
HOW.

02:05:45.771 --> 02:05:46.705
TO DEMONSTRATE WHAT YOU'VE DONE

02:05:46.772 --> 02:05:48.340
WITH THE MONEY BUT THEN THE

02:05:48.407 --> 02:05:49.575
OTHER PIECE AND THIS IS

02:05:49.642 --> 02:05:50.576
ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR SMALL

02:05:50.643 --> 02:05:51.944
NONPROFITS WHO ARE SORT OF

02:05:52.011 --> 02:05:53.979
MISSION FOCUSED IS.

02:05:54.046 --> 02:05:55.514
HOW DO YOU TELL YOUR STORY?

02:05:55.581 --> 02:05:56.682
AND HOW DO YOU SEE HOW DO YOU

02:05:56.749 --> 02:05:57.750
LOOK AT YOUR COMMUNITY AND

02:05:57.816 --> 02:05:59.118
FIGURE OUT WHO ARE THE STRATEGIC

02:05:59.184 --> 02:06:00.686
PARTNERSHIPS AND THEN HOW DO YOU

02:06:00.753 --> 02:06:01.987
APPROACH THOSE PEOPLE IN ORDER

02:06:02.054 --> 02:06:03.589
TO BUILD.

02:06:03.656 --> 02:06:05.024
PARTNERSHIPS FOR YOUR NOT MOST

02:06:05.090 --> 02:06:06.392
NONPROFITS DO WELL WHEN THEY'RE

02:06:06.458 --> 02:06:09.261
LINKED IN WITH OTHER NON PROFITS

02:06:09.328 --> 02:06:10.996
AS YOU ARE MAKING REALLY AN

02:06:11.063 --> 02:06:13.899
ELEGANT CASE -- FOR AND IT HELPS

02:06:13.966 --> 02:06:15.401
IF THEY'RE THAT THAT HELPS THEM

02:06:15.467 --> 02:06:16.735
IN ADVOCACY AS WELL AND SO I

02:06:16.802 --> 02:06:18.470
THINK IT'S A IT'S A PACKAGE OF

02:06:18.537 --> 02:06:20.005
THINGS THAT.

02:06:20.072 --> 02:06:21.740
HELP YOU BOTH.

02:06:21.807 --> 02:06:23.375
ADMINISTRATIVELY IT'S VERY

02:06:23.442 --> 02:06:25.878
DIFFICULT WE WE'RE AS YOU HEARD

02:06:25.945 --> 02:06:27.947
FROM THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS -- WE

02:06:28.013 --> 02:06:32.384
HAVE CHALLENGES IN BEING.

02:06:32.451 --> 02:06:33.385
TIMELY WITH PAYMENTS BUT

02:06:33.452 --> 02:06:34.520
NONPROFITS OFTEN HAVE CHALLENGES

02:06:34.586 --> 02:06:35.621
EVEN KNOWING HOW TO INVOICE FOR

02:06:35.688 --> 02:06:37.122
MONEY AND SO THAT MONEY GETS

02:06:37.189 --> 02:06:39.425
LEFT ON THE TABLE AND IT'S

02:06:39.491 --> 02:06:40.726
REALLY THAT'S AN UNFORTUNATE

02:06:40.793 --> 02:06:42.728
SITUATION SO SUMMIT IS VERY

02:06:42.795 --> 02:06:44.196
CONCRETE SOME OF IT IS MORE.

02:06:44.263 --> 02:06:45.898
HOW DO YOU TELL YOUR STORY HOW

02:06:45.965 --> 02:06:48.100
DO YOU -- WHO DO YOU ADVOCATE

02:06:48.167 --> 02:06:49.868
WITH HOW DO YOU BUILD STRATEGIC

02:06:49.935 --> 02:06:54.707
PARTNERSHIPS -- I AGAIN CHECK

02:06:54.773 --> 02:06:56.041
HELD AT AT AT THE THINK THE

02:06:56.108 --> 02:06:57.142
POINTED THAT.

02:06:57.209 --> 02:06:58.210
YOU MADE MADAM CHAIR ABOUT MULTI

02:06:58.277 --> 02:06:59.244
YEAR FUNDING IS THIS WAS IS

02:06:59.311 --> 02:07:01.413
REALLY IS A CRITICAL POINT --

02:07:01.480 --> 02:07:02.881
AGAIN GOING BACK TO MY MY

02:07:02.948 --> 02:07:04.984
EARLIER PITCH ABOUT A PARTICULAR

02:07:05.050 --> 02:07:06.485
SMALLER NONPROFITS PLAN FOR

02:07:06.552 --> 02:07:08.020
GRANT YOU HAVE TO DO THAT EVERY

02:07:08.087 --> 02:07:08.954
YEAR AT THAT.

02:07:09.021 --> 02:07:09.922
GETS TO BE VERY EXPENSIVE BUT IF

02:07:09.989 --> 02:07:11.490
YOU CAN PUT A GRANT TOGETHER

02:07:11.557 --> 02:07:13.926
OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD -- IT

02:07:13.993 --> 02:07:15.394
IT'S IT'S SPREAD SPREADS THE THE

02:07:15.461 --> 02:07:17.129
PAIN OF A BIT MORE SO I THINK

02:07:17.196 --> 02:07:17.963
THAT.

02:07:18.030 --> 02:07:20.499
IS CRITICAL PLUS IT ALLOWS --

02:07:20.566 --> 02:07:22.935
THESE NONPROFITS TO MAINTAIN OF

02:07:23.002 --> 02:07:24.636
AN APPOINTMENT BASIS AND AND

02:07:24.703 --> 02:07:28.640
PROVIDE THE SERVICES WITH SOME

02:07:28.707 --> 02:07:30.175
CONSISTENCY -- I THINK THE OTHER

02:07:30.242 --> 02:07:32.711
OTHER POINT IS IS COLLABORATION --

02:07:32.778 --> 02:07:34.346
THE MHS ALWAYS CS MENTAL

02:07:34.413 --> 02:07:35.647
HEALTH'S OVERSIGHT AND

02:07:35.714 --> 02:07:37.282
ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION IS A

02:07:37.349 --> 02:07:39.284
LONG AFTERNOON -- WITH THAT

02:07:39.351 --> 02:07:41.153
MENTAL HEALTH GRANT PROGRAM FUN

02:07:41.220 --> 02:07:42.955
ADVOCACY -- REGIONAL DUCATION

02:07:43.022 --> 02:07:44.556
SEVEN OR EIGHT STAKEHOLDER THAT

02:07:44.623 --> 02:07:46.625
RECEIVE GRANTS AND QUARTERLY WE

02:07:46.692 --> 02:07:49.228
MADE -- AS A GROUP AND AND AND

02:07:49.294 --> 02:07:49.962
TALK ABOUT HOW WE'RE

02:07:50.029 --> 02:07:51.063
IMPLEMENTING THE GRANT AND THE

02:07:51.130 --> 02:07:52.498
THINGS THAT WE CAN DO IT BECOME

02:07:52.564 --> 02:07:53.699
MORE EFFECTIVE.

02:07:53.766 --> 02:07:55.234
AND IT IN THE WHOLE RANGE OF

02:07:55.300 --> 02:07:57.569
MENTAL SERVICES LGBTQ COMMUNITY

02:07:57.636 --> 02:08:00.105
PERRANCE VETERANS -- AND

02:08:00.172 --> 02:08:01.673
ENSURING THAT INFORMATION I

02:08:01.740 --> 02:08:04.877
THINK HELPS -- ALL OF THE

02:08:04.943 --> 02:08:06.045
NONPROFITS IMPLEMENT THOSE

02:08:06.111 --> 02:08:07.679
GRANTS MORE EFFECTIVELY BUT ALSO

02:08:07.746 --> 02:08:10.315
FIGURE OUT WAYS TO BECOME MORE

02:08:10.382 --> 02:08:14.353
EFFICIENT AND MORE EFFECTIVE.

02:08:14.420 --> 02:08:16.488
THANK YOU.

02:08:16.555 --> 02:08:17.723
SO I THINK WITH THE WHAT OFFICE

02:08:17.790 --> 02:08:18.323
OF HEALTH EQUITY HAS DONE IS

02:08:18.390 --> 02:08:19.324
IT'S BEEN SO DIFFERENT IN TERMS

02:08:19.391 --> 02:08:20.859
OF YOU KNOW INITIALLY PROVIDING.

02:08:20.926 --> 02:08:22.728
LISTENING TO THE COMMUNITY -- ON

02:08:22.795 --> 02:08:24.730
WHAT THEY NEED -- WHETHER IT'S

02:08:24.797 --> 02:08:25.898
FOR SERVICE SOARED AS A NON

02:08:25.964 --> 02:08:28.267
PROFIT HOW CAN THEY DELIVER THAT

02:08:28.333 --> 02:08:30.069
SERVICE I THINK -- THAT'S BEEN

02:08:30.135 --> 02:08:31.103
WONDERFUL THE TECHNICAL

02:08:31.170 --> 02:08:33.005
ASSISTANCE AS BEEN EXCELLENT AND

02:08:33.072 --> 02:08:34.706
THEN FLEXIBILITY AND ALSO

02:08:34.773 --> 02:08:36.175
LISTENING TO EACH PARTICULAR

02:08:36.241 --> 02:08:38.544
NONPROFIT AS TO WHAT THEY NEED.

02:08:38.610 --> 02:08:40.045
IN TERMS OF THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE

02:08:40.112 --> 02:08:42.014
OR OR OR IN TERMS OF THEIR NEEDS

02:08:42.081 --> 02:08:44.183
AS A COMMUNITY I THINK ALL OF

02:08:44.249 --> 02:08:44.983
THAT OFFICE ABOUT HOW

02:08:45.050 --> 02:08:47.019
HEALTHEQUITY HAS BEEN DOING AND

02:08:47.086 --> 02:08:48.687
IT'S BEEN -- JUST VERY BEAUTIFUL

02:08:48.754 --> 02:08:51.824
I THINK -- BUT IN ADDITION TO

02:08:51.890 --> 02:08:52.858
THAT.

02:08:52.925 --> 02:08:54.193
I I THINK AS A SMALL NONPROFIT

02:08:54.259 --> 02:08:55.394
WHEN YOU HAVE NOT RECEIVED

02:08:55.461 --> 02:08:56.662
FUNDING BEFORE AND THEN YOU

02:08:56.728 --> 02:08:57.896
RECEIVE.

02:08:57.963 --> 02:08:59.498
ONE OF HAVING.

02:08:59.565 --> 02:09:02.534
OF HAVING THE THE THE CASH FLOW

02:09:02.601 --> 02:09:04.303
TO BE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT'S

02:09:04.369 --> 02:09:05.671
MORE REIMBURSABLE INVOICING.

02:09:05.737 --> 02:09:08.540
THAT PART IS IS DIFFICULT -- AND

02:09:08.607 --> 02:09:11.243
SO -- LEARNING HOW TO MANAGE

02:09:11.310 --> 02:09:13.112
THAT AND MATCHING IT AND SO

02:09:13.178 --> 02:09:14.513
FORTH I THINK THAT'S ONE

02:09:14.580 --> 02:09:17.049
CHALLENGE FOR NONPROFITS WHO'D

02:09:17.116 --> 02:09:19.918
NEVER HAD FUNDING -- I HOPE I'M

02:09:19.985 --> 02:09:20.519
CLEAR IN WHAT I'M TRYING TO

02:09:20.586 --> 02:09:22.688
COMMUNICATE HERE BUT I THINK

02:09:22.754 --> 02:09:26.091
THAT'S A ONE MAJOR -- THING THAT

02:09:26.158 --> 02:09:27.226
I THINK WOULD BE EXTREMELY

02:09:27.292 --> 02:09:29.561
HELPFUL IF IF THERE'S A WAY TO

02:09:29.628 --> 02:09:33.031
ALLEVIATE THAT FOR FIRST SMALL

02:09:33.098 --> 02:09:37.069
NON PROFITS -- BUT OF THIS KIND

02:09:37.136 --> 02:09:38.070
OF PIGGY BACK OF WHAT I THINK

02:09:38.137 --> 02:09:38.637
EVERYONE'S PRETTY MUCH SAID

02:09:38.704 --> 02:09:39.304
THINK MULTI YEAR GRANTS ARE ARE

02:09:39.371 --> 02:09:41.173
ARE HUGE IT REDUCES THE THE

02:09:41.240 --> 02:09:43.642
TURNOVER AND IT ALLOWS FOR SOME

02:09:43.709 --> 02:09:45.277
INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE IN THE

02:09:45.344 --> 02:09:46.778
IN THE IN THE NONPROFIT SAN IN

02:09:46.845 --> 02:09:48.747
ANYWHERE -- I THINK FOR IN THE

02:09:48.814 --> 02:09:50.048
VETERAN COMMUNITY IT'S VERY

02:09:50.115 --> 02:09:51.183
IMPORTANT.

02:09:51.250 --> 02:09:52.651
FOR THE SERVICE ADVISORS TO

02:09:52.718 --> 02:09:54.219
UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS OF THE

02:09:54.286 --> 02:09:55.954
VETERANS AND I THINK IF THERE'S

02:09:56.021 --> 02:09:57.456
A LARGE TURNOVER THAT YOU'RE

02:09:57.523 --> 02:09:59.091
GONNA KINDA LOSE THAT INTEREST

02:09:59.158 --> 02:10:00.559
INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE OF OF

02:10:00.626 --> 02:10:01.527
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE

02:10:01.593 --> 02:10:01.994
COMMUNITY.

02:10:02.060 --> 02:10:03.629
IT'S CHANGING DAY TODAY I THINK

02:10:03.695 --> 02:10:06.632
A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE OUTSIDE

02:10:06.698 --> 02:10:08.667
PROBABLY MINUSES ROOM.

02:10:08.734 --> 02:10:09.768
THINK THE VETERAN COMMUNITY IS

02:10:09.835 --> 02:10:11.803
IS GET GROWING IT'S GOING HIGHER

02:10:11.870 --> 02:10:13.071
OR LARGER THE CHECK TO GETTING

02:10:13.138 --> 02:10:15.040
SMALLER -- BECAUSE THE VIETNAM

02:10:15.107 --> 02:10:15.974
ERA WORLD WAR -- TWO THERE

02:10:16.041 --> 02:10:16.942
ANOTHER PASSING AWAY SO THE

02:10:17.009 --> 02:10:19.144
NEEDS ARE DIFFERENT IT'S AGING

02:10:19.211 --> 02:10:20.879
KIND OF RIGHT NOW BUT IT'S ALSO

02:10:20.946 --> 02:10:22.181
MENTAL HEALTH AT THE SAME TIME I

02:10:22.247 --> 02:10:23.248
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AT THE

02:10:23.315 --> 02:10:25.150
NONPROFIT CAN UNDERSTAND.

02:10:25.217 --> 02:10:27.119
THE NEEDS OF THE VETERANS.

02:10:27.186 --> 02:10:31.490
RIGHT AND FINALLY MY LAST

02:10:31.557 --> 02:10:33.692
QUESTION IS -- BUT YEAH IT'S A

02:10:33.759 --> 02:10:34.693
LONG LINES I THINK OF OF WHAT

02:10:34.760 --> 02:10:35.327
I'VE BEEN.

02:10:35.394 --> 02:10:37.629
ED JUST IT KIND OF MENTIONING OF

02:10:37.696 --> 02:10:38.997
YOU'VE GIVEN US IDEAS OF THINGS

02:10:39.064 --> 02:10:41.433
THAT COULD BE CHANGED ARE THERE

02:10:41.500 --> 02:10:44.336
ANY -- KIND OF LAST THOUGHT THAT

02:10:44.403 --> 02:10:45.270
YOU WANT TO LEAVE WITH A

02:10:45.337 --> 02:10:47.573
LEGISLATIVE BODY IN TERMS OF THE

02:10:47.639 --> 02:10:50.576
WORK YOU DO AND AND ELEMENTS

02:10:50.642 --> 02:10:52.211
THAT WE SHOULD KEEP IN MIND NOT

02:10:52.277 --> 02:10:53.879
JUST AS YOU KNOW WE'RE MOVING

02:10:53.946 --> 02:10:55.747
LEGISLATION FORWARD BUT AS FOR

02:10:55.814 --> 02:10:59.251
CRAFTING LEGISLATION AS WELL.

02:10:59.318 --> 02:11:00.919
AND USE SHARED DEFINITELY VERY

02:11:00.986 --> 02:11:02.221
PRACTICAL THINGS THAT IF THERE'S

02:11:02.287 --> 02:11:04.356
ANYTHING ELSE FOR MORE OF A

02:11:04.423 --> 02:11:07.926
POLICY PERSPECTIVE.

02:11:07.993 --> 02:11:09.928
AND NOW WHEN I GUESS IN MENTAL

02:11:09.995 --> 02:11:12.497
HEALTH AS WELL GIVEN WATER THE

02:11:12.564 --> 02:11:14.366
WORD SERVICE DELIVERY SMALL NON

02:11:14.433 --> 02:11:15.267
PROFITS I AM THANK YOU ALSO FOR

02:11:15.334 --> 02:11:16.235
BRINGING UP THE POINT ABOUT

02:11:16.301 --> 02:11:17.436
THEIR INABILITY.

02:11:17.502 --> 02:11:19.571
WE CAN'T GIVE MONEY FOR

02:11:19.638 --> 02:11:20.172
SOMETHING THAT HASN'T ALREADY

02:11:20.239 --> 02:11:21.039
HAPPENED.

02:11:21.106 --> 02:11:23.242
THE STATE CANNOT GRANT ST MONEY

02:11:23.308 --> 02:11:23.775
FOR SOMETHING HAS ALREADY

02:11:23.842 --> 02:11:24.476
HAPPENED.

02:11:24.543 --> 02:11:26.712
THAT IS A HUGE BARRIER TO

02:11:26.778 --> 02:11:29.248
GETTING SMALL NONPROFITS EITHER

02:11:29.314 --> 02:11:30.949
EXPANDING OR DOING SOMETHING NEW

02:11:31.016 --> 02:11:31.550
BECAUSE THEY'RE RUNNING RIGHT

02:11:31.617 --> 02:11:33.719
CLOSE TO THEIR BASE LINE IF WE

02:11:33.785 --> 02:11:35.254
WERE ABLE TO GIVE.

02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:37.289
MONEY TO GET THEM TO START UP

02:11:37.356 --> 02:11:39.224
FUNDING AND ACTUALLY START FOR

02:11:39.291 --> 02:11:40.559
RECEIVING SERVICES.

02:11:40.626 --> 02:11:43.262
WHICH EITHER COULD BE PAY BACK

02:11:43.328 --> 02:11:44.863
OR YOU KNOW SO IN OTHER WORDS IT

02:11:44.930 --> 02:11:46.265
DON'T IT AS IT ABOUT POSTS ARE

02:11:46.331 --> 02:11:46.498
SAYING.

02:11:46.565 --> 02:11:47.833
OKAY GO AHEAD.

02:11:47.899 --> 02:11:49.134
EXPAND YOUR SERVICES WE'RE GONNA

02:11:49.201 --> 02:11:50.269
GIVE YOU ANY MONEY UNTIL YOU

02:11:50.335 --> 02:11:51.637
BILL US FOR THOSE SERVICES YOU

02:11:51.703 --> 02:11:53.338
CAN'T HIRE PEOPLE ON A PROMISE

02:11:53.405 --> 02:11:55.040
THAT YOU'LL PAY THEM LATER --

02:11:55.107 --> 02:11:56.408
AND THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT

02:11:56.475 --> 02:11:57.809
WE'RE ASKING NON PROFITS TO DO

02:11:57.876 --> 02:11:58.877
AND I THINK FOR SMALL

02:11:58.944 --> 02:12:00.946
ORGANIZATIONS IN PARTICULAR THAT

02:12:01.013 --> 02:12:02.714
DON'T CARRY A LARGE AMOUNT OF OF

02:12:02.781 --> 02:12:03.915
MONEY IN THE BANK.

02:12:03.982 --> 02:12:09.254
IT'S IT ACTUALLY CAN BE A GAME

02:12:09.321 --> 02:12:14.459
AND I WAS -- TAKEN BY ONE OF THE

02:12:14.526 --> 02:12:15.327
EARLIER --COMMENTS THAT WAS

02:12:15.394 --> 02:12:16.361
MADE IN THE IN THE FIRST PANEL

02:12:16.428 --> 02:12:18.830
ABOUT HOW LARGE THE NONPROFIT --

02:12:18.897 --> 02:12:21.066
COMMUNITY IS AND IN CALIFORNIA

02:12:21.133 --> 02:12:22.634
IT SURPRISED ME I HAD NO IDEA

02:12:22.701 --> 02:12:24.870
WHAT ONE IN -- SEVEN AND AND I

02:12:24.936 --> 02:12:25.871
THINK THAT.

02:12:25.937 --> 02:12:28.707
IT JUST IT JUST BRINGS TO MIND

02:12:28.774 --> 02:12:29.341
THE IMPORTS OF THIS COMMITTEE.

02:12:29.408 --> 02:12:30.509
AND AND THE WORK THAT THIS

02:12:30.575 --> 02:12:32.044
COMMITTEE DOES BECAUSE OF ITS

02:12:32.110 --> 02:12:33.578
THAT LARGE A SEGMENT OF OUR OUR

02:12:33.645 --> 02:12:35.681
ECONOMY OF OUR OUR BY OUR WORK

02:12:35.747 --> 02:12:38.150
FORCE -- WE CERTAINLY ARE PAYING

02:12:38.216 --> 02:12:39.284
ENOUGH ATTENTION TO IT.

02:12:39.351 --> 02:12:41.153
ANNA AND I THINK THAT THE FACT

02:12:41.219 --> 02:12:41.953
THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE HEARING

02:12:42.020 --> 02:12:43.822
HIGHLIGHTING THAT IS IMPORTANT

02:12:43.889 --> 02:12:45.557
AND I THINK JUST IT NEEDS WE

02:12:45.624 --> 02:12:46.992
NEED MORE OF THAT WE NEED.

02:12:47.059 --> 02:12:48.593
MORE OF AN UP THE NONPROFIT OR

02:12:48.660 --> 02:12:50.662
THE MONEY TO RUN AROUND TELL

02:12:50.729 --> 02:12:51.263
EVERYBODY WE'RE DOING A GREAT

02:12:51.330 --> 02:12:52.964
JOB -- AND SO.

02:12:53.031 --> 02:12:55.167
THIS IS FREE OPPORTUNITY FOR US

02:12:55.233 --> 02:12:56.535
TO DO THAT WE APPRECIATE THAT

02:12:56.601 --> 02:12:56.802
VERY MUCH.

02:12:56.868 --> 02:12:58.070
THANK YOU.

02:12:58.136 --> 02:12:59.905
SO -- I'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH

02:12:59.971 --> 02:13:00.605
WITH.

02:13:00.672 --> 02:13:03.208
A PROPOSITION SIXTY THREE SINCE

02:13:03.275 --> 02:13:03.842
TWO THOUSAND FOUR IN MY PREVIOUS

02:13:03.909 --> 02:13:05.510
POSITIONS AND THEN IN TWO

02:13:05.577 --> 02:13:06.912
THOUSAND NINE WHEN -- OFFICE OF

02:13:06.978 --> 02:13:08.814
HEALTH EQUITY WAS STARTING THE

02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:10.415
PHASE ONE AND PHASE TO PHASE ONE

02:13:10.482 --> 02:13:11.983
AND AND ALSO ON A PERSONAL LEVEL

02:13:12.050 --> 02:13:13.518
I AM I AM FROM AFGHANISTAN AND

02:13:13.585 --> 02:13:14.720
I'VE GONE TO THE WHOLE REFUGEE

02:13:14.786 --> 02:13:16.154
PROCESS WHEN I WAS A CHILD.

02:13:16.221 --> 02:13:19.257
AND SO -- I THINK WITH THAT SAID --

02:13:19.324 --> 02:13:21.259
WE NEED TO JUST FOCUS MORE ON

02:13:21.326 --> 02:13:23.562
LISTENING. TO THE COMMUNITIES

02:13:23.628 --> 02:13:25.030
THAT ARE IN NEED IN WITHIN THESE

02:13:25.097 --> 02:13:26.665
NONPROFITS IN TERMS OF WHAT

02:13:26.732 --> 02:13:28.734
WORKS FOR THEM TO HELP THEM HEAL

02:13:28.800 --> 02:13:30.302
AND TO LIVE A LIFE OF WILDNESS.

02:13:30.369 --> 02:13:31.837
AND I THINK -- OFFICE OF HEALTH

02:13:31.903 --> 02:13:33.071
EQUITY HAS BEEN ONE OF THE FEW

02:13:33.138 --> 02:13:34.439
THAT PROBABLY THE ONLY ONE WHO'S

02:13:34.506 --> 02:13:37.109
BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT -- BECAUSE

02:13:37.175 --> 02:13:38.977
IT IS SO IMPORTANT AND THEIR

02:13:39.044 --> 02:13:39.878

MY COLLEAGUES WHO.

CERTAINLY RELATED TO WHAT THE

02:19:07.238 --> 02:19:09.708
STATE CAN -- PERHAPS DUE TO

02:19:09.774 --> 02:19:12.911
ALLOW FLEXIBILITY TO ALSO FOCUS

02:19:12.977 --> 02:19:14.979
ON THE SMALLER NONPROFIT TO HAVE

02:19:15.046 --> 02:19:17.615
A DIFFERENT TOUCH ON A A YOU

02:19:17.682 --> 02:19:18.116
KNOW WITHIN THEIR THEIR

02:19:18.183 --> 02:19:20.552
COMMUNITY -- AT AS WELL AS

02:19:20.618 --> 02:19:22.253
REALLY FOCUSING ON SOME OF THE

02:19:22.320 --> 02:19:23.955
GREATER ISSUES THAT CANNOT BE

02:19:24.022 --> 02:19:25.824
SOLVED A THING TODAY -- BY THE

02:19:25.890 --> 02:19:28.293
STATE ALONE -- MENTAL HEALTH IS

02:19:28.359 --> 02:19:32.664
ONE OF THE THE THE ISSUES THAT

02:19:32.731 --> 02:19:33.364
DESPITE.

02:19:33.431 --> 02:19:34.566
SO MANY MEMBERS KNOWING HOW BIG

02:19:34.632 --> 02:19:36.601

WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH -- AS A

02:19:42.607 --> 02:19:45.910
STATE AND A THINK THAT WE WE

02:19:45.977 --> 02:19:47.779
HEAR OF OF SOME OF SOME OF THESE

02:19:47.846 --> 02:19:49.114
AREAS WHERE THE FUNDING IS GOING

02:19:49.180 --> 02:19:50.415
THAT IS MAKING A DIFFERENCE AND

02:19:50.482 --> 02:19:52.016
THAT'S REALLY HELPFUL FOR US TO

02:19:52.083 --> 02:19:53.985
HEAR -- BUT ALSO TO RECOGNIZE

02:19:54.052 --> 02:19:55.487
THAT WE CAN'T DO IT ALONE AND
